 A water main has burst closing a section one of Portsmouth's busiest roads. The pipe under the A2047 London Road ruptured early on Thursday morning flooding the road and leaving homes without water supplies. The burst has caused extensive structural damage and left standing water, silt and mud on the road. The road is closed in both directions between the Angerstein Road junction and the Kirby Road junction. Portsmouth Water said the affected pipe was isolated in the early hours and water supplies should now be restored. Company spokesman Ian Limb said: "It's a huge beast of a water main, it's destroyed the road. "We apologise for any inconvenience." Diversion routes have been put in place but major disruption is expected for motorists.
