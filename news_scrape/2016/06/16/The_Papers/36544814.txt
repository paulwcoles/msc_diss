 Former BHS owner Sir Philip Green's appearance before a Commons committee probing the collapse of the retailer comes under the spotlight in Thursday's press. Sir Philip, who has come in for criticism for the Â£400m in dividends taken out of BHS during his 15-year ownership, sold the firm last year. And for the Daily Mirror, the committee failed to get to the bottom of the "scandal" of its demise. "However, as he rightly observed, the priority must be to rescue the pension fund... he has given an assurance that a solution will be found... He must now deliver on that promise." The confrontation on the Thames between UKIP leader Nigel Farage's "Brexit flotilla" of fishermen backing the Leave case and a pleasure cruiser carrying rock star Bob Geldof and other Remain supporters attracts plenty of headlines. But this time "sailing under the rival flag of the European Union was a liner captained by multi-millionaire Remain cheerleader Bob Geldof". "Rival leave and remain fleets skippered in spirit by the UKIP leader and the rock star fundraiser skirmished on the fast flowing river between Tower Bridge and the Palace of Westminster," adds the paper. "They say it's difficult to engage the young in politics. But I reckon that story should help spark their interest." After the Sun urged support for Brexit earlier this week, the FT maintains in an editorial that "Leave has failed to spell out the serious risks of life outside the EU".  "The positive case for Britain in the EU is easily made," it says. "To abandon the cause of constructive reform of an admittedly imperfect EU would be more than defeatist. It would be a gratuitous act of self-harm."
