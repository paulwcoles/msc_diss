 A north Wales council could scrap its pest control service in a bid to cut costs. Gwynedd council is under pressure to make savings, and approved £4.6m of cuts to services in March. A report due to go before the authority's scrutiny committee on Thursday says the closure of the service would save £28,440 a year. Between 2014 and 2015, the service was called out a total of 1,190 times - with wasps the most common problem. Officers have recommended increasing revenue by £40,000 to make the service self-sufficient, "rather than abolishing the pest control service in its entirety." At an earlier meeting, councillors called the service "important and necessary" and said if it was closed there was "a risk that private companies would completely control the market and increase their prices".
