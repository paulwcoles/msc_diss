 A man has been charged with the murder of a mother and daughter who were found dead at a house in Liverpool. Karen and Jade Hales, aged 53 and 28, were found at the property in Cathedral Road, Anfield, on Monday. Post-mortem examinations found they died from severe blunt force head injuries, police said. Anthony Showers, 42, of Clarendon Road, Anfield, appeared before magistrates in Sefton and was remanded to appear at Liverpool Crown Court on 20 June. Neighbours said that Jade looked after her mother as her full-time carer and was regularly seen walking her dog, Tyson, a Staffordshire bull terrier, that was also found dead.
