 An Egyptian milk advert in which toddlers refer to their mothers' breasts has been banned after a public outcry, with some complaining it could encourage sexual harassment towards women.

It first aired at the start of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, clocking up 1.6m views on YouTube in less than a week. But it quickly ignited a storm of criticism from social media users.
