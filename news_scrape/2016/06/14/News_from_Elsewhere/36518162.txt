 A village in western Hungary has started to collect recyclable waste from people's homes using horse-drawn carts. The trial scheme in Nagyvazsony has seen conventional bin lorries replaced by the much quieter clip-clop of horses' hooves, in an effort to save money and help the environment. It's the idea of village mayor Szabolcs Janos Fabry, and is part of efforts to meet EU and Hungarian rules on collecting recyclable rubbish from every household in the country.
