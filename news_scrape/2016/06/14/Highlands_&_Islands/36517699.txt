 The Isle of Barra's world famous beach airport is 80 years old. The first planes landed on the sand in the wide bay of Traigh Mhor in June 1936. It was officially licensed as an airport in August that year. Flights to and from Barra are dictated by the tide and its three runways are fully submerged at high tide. Small planes, specially designed to be able to land on the beach, fly between the island and Glasgow on a lifeline service subsidised by the Scottish government. Last year, Canadian company Viking Air Limited won the contract to provide two new 19-seater Twin Otter DHC6-400 aircraft to fly on the route. According to Hial, the route involves more than 10,000 passengers a year. There are also about 60 private light aircraft flights to Barra per year.
