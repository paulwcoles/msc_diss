CAN CHELSEA GET REVENGE QUE JUSTIN 
ROSE WIN THE OPEN CAN MARK FOSTER 
SWING TO OLYMPIC GLORY AND HOW DO 
YOU PLAY BLIND FOOTBALL WE HAVE 
THE ANSWERS TONIGHT ON INSIDE SPORT 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO INSIDE SPORT 
OR AS THEY SAY IN MOSCOW PRIV Y. ET 
TWO DAYS TO GO UNTIL THE FIRST ALL 
ENGLISH CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL IN 
MOSCOW THE MAN IN THE MASK AND 
THESE SCANS SHOW WHY PETR CECH HAS 
TO WEAR SPECIAL PROTECTION FOR HIS 
HEAD HE TELLS US THAT HAVING 
ALREADY WON THE TITLE MANCHESTER 
UNITED MIGHT BE A BIT TOO RELAXED 
THEY HAVE ALREADY SUCCEEDED THIS 
SEASON BACK TO BACK TITLES THEY 
MIGHT BE MORE RELAXED AND THIS 
COULD BE THE OPENING FOR US JUSTIN JUSTIN ROSE ANAND AN AMATEUR NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT NOW 
A SUPERSTAR HE IS BACK AND IT 
SEEMS FOR HIS FANS THE MEMORY OF 
THAT SHOT LIVES ON 
PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN TRYING TO REPLICATE MY SHOT 
HE IS NEARLY THIRTY EIGHT BUT TRYING FOR HIS 
FIRST EVER OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL MARK 
FOSTER ON WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP A 
BODY LIKE HIS IN SHAPE 
IF YOU CANNOT SEE THE BALL HOW CAN 
YOU KICK IT DES HAD A GAME WITH 
THE BRITISH BLIND FOOTBALL TEAM AND 
HE WAS NO LIONEL MESSI 
IT IS 
ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE 
WITH ME TONIGHT MAN WHO ALWAYS 
CONNECTS STEVE BUNCE OF THE 
INDEPENDENT AND DES KELLY OF THE 
DAILY MAIL 
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN PETR CECH 
MUST HAVE DOUBTED HE WOULD EVER 
PLAY AGAIN LET ALONE IN THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL HIS SKULL 
WAS FRACTURED LAST SEASON AND HE 
NOW HAS TO WEAR PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR 
HE HAS GONE FROM STRENGTH TO 
STRENGTH ON THE PITCH WHILE OFF IT 
HE HAS BECOME A FATHER FOR THE 
FIRST TIME WITH THE MATCH AGAINST 
MANCHESTER UNITED A COUPLE OF DAYS 
AWAY DES WENT TO MEET HIM 
I THINK THIS PICTURE IS THE MOST 
INTERESTING YOU CAN SEE THE SKULL 
I WAS TOLD THERE WERE TWO HOLES 
HERE THEY WERE DONE BY THE SURGEON 
THESE ARE THE DISLODGED PIECES 
BROKEN FROM THE IMPACT THIS IS THE 
FIRST TIME SOMEBODY WILL SEE WHAT 
HAS BEEN DONE WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT 
THE DEPRESSED SKULL YOU IMAGINE A 
LOT OF THINGS 
DOES IT STILL DID 
YOU PAIN CAN YOU FEEL IT 
IT IS 
STILL HEALING GIVE YOU PAIN YOU 
CAN FEEL HOW THE MUSCLES AROUND IT 
ARE PROTECTING THE AREA SOMETIMES 
IT IS VERY STIFF THERE ARE 
METALLIC PLATES 
DO YOU THINK TWICE 
ABOUT GOING IN FOR A CHALLENGE YOU 
HAVE A SCAR HERE 
I KEEP COLLECTING 
SCARS IT SHOWS THAT I HAVE NOT 
CHANGED MY STYLE OF PLAY WHEN I 
NEED TO DIVE INTO PEOPLE'S FEET I 
HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT 
YOU ARE ONE OF TRIPLETS WAS THAT 
ONE OF THE REASONS THERE WAS A 
THEORY IT MAKES THE BONES OF YOUR 
SKULL SLIGHTLY THINNER BECAUSE OF 
THREE BABIES BEING BORN AT THE SAME 
TIME 
THAT IS CORRECT THERE IS TIME ALWAYS THE AVERAGE OF THE SKULL 
THICKNESS I AM BELOW AVERAGE 
MAYBE THIS IS THE REASON WHY I GOT 
INJURED THIS IS JUST A 
HYPOTHETICAL THING MAYBE I WOULD 
HAVE BEEN INJURED LESS THAN THIS 
MAYBE NOT AT ALL IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO KNOW ACTUALLY IF I ASK YOU 
WHAT IS YOUR SKULL THICKNESS 
PRETTY THICK 
YOU HAVE A BABY DAUGHTER NOW SHE 
WAS BORN WHEN YOU WERE PLAYING 
FOOTBALL 
I WAS READY IN LONDON TO FOOTBALL FLY ANY TIME I WAS WAITING FOR THE 
CALL WE WENT TO LIVERPOOL FOR THE 
SEMI FINAL OF THE CARLING CUP L. 
SPOKE TO MY WIFE EVEN BEFORE 
MIDNIGHT I CALLED HER L. ASKED IF 
SHE WANTED ME TO ASK THE COMPANY TO 
MOVE THE PLANE TO LIVERPOOL IN CASE 
SHE SAID SHE WAS FINE SHE WAS BORN 
AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IF IT 
HAD HAPPENED AT MIDDAY I WOULD 
HAVE GONE 
I WOULD HAVE MISSED THE 
GAME DID YOU WANT TO BE AN ICE 
HOCKEY GOALKEEPER 
YES WHEN I WAS 
A CHILD IT WAS MY DREAM IT WAS 
TOO EXPENSIVE FOR MY FAMILY IN THE 
END TO BUY A PAIR OF SHOES IT WAS 
EASIER AS SOON AS MY FATHER TOOK 
ME TO THE FOOTBALL GROUND I REALLY 
LOVED FOOTBALL SINCE THEN 
YOU HAVE A MOMENTOUS WEEK AHEAD 
THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL YOU ARE 
PLAYING MANCHESTER UNITED YOU'RE 
GREAT RIVALS DOMESTICALLY WHO HAS 
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EDGE 
HAVING WON 
THE TITLE YOU WOULD SAY IT IS A 
BIG BOOST FOR THEM IN ONE WAY IT 
CAN BE DESTRUCTIVE YOU COULD RELAX 
IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND YOU HAVE 
ALREADY SUCCEEDED THEY HAVE WON 
BACK TO BACK TITLES AND MAYBE THEY 
WILL RELAX THIS COULD BE THE 
ADVANTAGE FOR US 
WILL IT BE BETTER 
THAN THE LAST F. A. CUP FINAL IT WAS 
NOT A GREAT SPECTACLE 
IF YOU ASK 
ME IF WE CAN SURPRISE EACH OTHER I 
SAY NO BECAUSE WE HAVE PLAYED THEM 
SO MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS BOTH 
TEAMS HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH 
AS A 
GOALKEEPER IS THERE A PLAYER YOU 
PARTICULAR YOU PARTICULARLY FEAR 
IN THE MANCHESTER UNITED TEAM 
CRISTIANO RONALDO 
THE WAY HE 
SCORES GOALS IS UNBELIEVABLE HE 
CAN SCORE A PENALTY HE CAN SCORE 
WITH A HEADER FROM A CORNER HE CAN 
SCORE WITH BOTH FEET THEY HAVE A 
GREAT TEAM THEY HAVE AN ATTACKING 
THREAT WITH ROONEY TEVEZ GIGGS 
THEY CAN USE THE BALL QUICKLY THEY 
ROTATE A LOT THAT IS WHY THEY ARE 
DANGEROUS THEY CAN SCORE A LOT OF 
GOALS NOT EVERYBODY CAN COPE DO DO YOU GET FRUSTRATED CHELSEA DO NOT 
GET ENOUGH CREDIT YOU ARE 
CRITICISED FOR NOT BEING 
ENTERTAINING ENOUGH ARE YOU AWARE 
OF THIS AS A GOALKEEPER 
FOR THE 
SUPPORTERS IT IS IMPORTANT TO 
ENTERTAIN IN THE END THEY WILL 
ALL REMEMBER THE YEARS WITH THE 
TROPHIES I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WILL 
REMEMBER THAT ARSENAL SQUAD OF TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WITH THEIR GREAT PASSING 
BUT THEY NEVER WON ANYTHING MAYBE 
IN TEN YEARS' TIME THEY WILL NOT 
REMEMBER 
DO YOU MISS JOSE 
NO IN LIFE YOU 
HAVE ALWAYS GOT MOMENTS WHEN YOU 
ENJOY WORKING WITH SOME PEOPLE AND 
IN FOOTBALL EVERYTHING CHANGES 
BEEN SPLIT OF A SECOND WHEN THE 
NEW MANAGER WAS APPOINTED WE KNEW 
IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT YOU NEED TO 
RESPECT THAT THERE IS A NEW MANAGER 
YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THAT HE WANTS 
TO CHANGE SOMETHING 
YOU WERE 
QUOTED AS SAYING IT IS BETTER IN 
SOME WAYS WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE 
WHICH PARTS OF IT TO HAVE IMPROVED 
WE IMPROVED AS CLUB AS A TEAM 
LOT DURING THAT TIME IT WAS WHEN 
JOSE MOURINHO WAS SACKED THERE WAS 
A LOT OF PRESSURE A LOT OF 
QUESTIONS WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN 
WITH THE TEAM IT SHOWED THAT EVEN 
AT A BAD TIME IN THE MOMENT WHEN 
EVERYONE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE WEAK 
AND EVERYTHING WILL GO DOWN WE 
ACTUALLY SHOWED WE WERE STRONGER 
MANY REPORTS SAY HIS VOTE DEPENDS 
ON WINNING THE TROPHY HOW DO YOU 
SEE THAT HIS FATE DEPENDS THIS THIS IS A QUESTION MORE FOR THE BOARD 
THAN FOR THE PLAYERS WITH THE 
AVERAGE OF WE HAVE WON WITH AVRAM 
GRANT IT IS A GOOD RECORD THE 
AVERAGE OF SO WE HAVE ONE 
WE HAVE 
HEARD YOU ARE LEAVING US YOU ARE 
LEAVING CHELSEA AND HEADING 
SOMEWHERE ELSE 
AT CHELSEA I AM 
REALLY HAPPY HERE AS I SAID AT THE 
BEGINNING I THINK THIS CLUB IS ONE 
OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD AND THIS 
LEAGUE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD IF 
YOU TAKE THIS COMBINATION THERE IS 
NO PLACE TO MOVE L. AM HAPPY HERE 
AND I HAD TO BE HERE AS LONG AS I 
CAN CAN LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE X. RAYS WHEN 
I FIRST SAW THAT I COULD NOT 
BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING THIS MAN 
WAS FIRSTLY STILL ALIVE AND 
BREATHING AND STILL OPERATING AS 
NORMAL HUMAN BEING AND THEN 
PUTTING HIMSELF IN THE LINE OF FIRE 
IN THE SAME POSITION THAT THE 
INJURY WAS CAUSED FROM INCREDIBLE 
THAT HE WANTS TO AND IS BRAVE 
ENOUGH TO DO IT 
WHEN HE SAID 
LET'S LOOK AT THE M. R. I. SCAN OF THE 
INJURY I DID NOT EXPECT THAT AS 
HE SAID I DID NOT KNOW WHAT A 
FRACTURED SKULL LOOKS LIKE BUT YOU 
COULD SEE THE INJURY AND WHAT A 
MASSIVE RISK IT WAS FOR HIM TO COME 
BACK SO SOON HE WAS BLACK BACK 
PLAYING AFTER THREE MONTHS THE 
INJURY HAS HEALED BUT YOU CAN SEE 
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE RISK WHEN HE 
WENT BACK 
IT MAY HAVE HEALED BUT 
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT PART OF THE 
BONE FLAP HAS BEEN SNAPPED IT IS 
HELD IN PLACE BY TWO TITANIUM 
PLATES I CANNOT THINK OF ANOTHER 
SPORT WHERE THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR 
CONTACT THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED 
TO PLAY EITHER AT AMATEUR LEVEL 
SEMI PRO LEVEL OR PROFESSIONAL 
LEVEL 
AND HE HAS A THIN SKULL AS LEVEL WELL BUT YOU KNOW WITH THE YEAR 
HE HAS HAD NOT JUST WITH THE 
INJURY BUT ALSO THE BIRTH OF HIS 
CHILD AND WHETHER HE SHOULD OR 
SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THERE YOU 
KNOW HE WILL FEATURE ON WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT 
ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING WILL NIGHT HAPPEN AND HE WILL BE THERE BUT IT 
WILL NOT BE ANYTHING GRAPHIC WE 
ALL KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU ARE 
WASTING YOUR MONEY IF YOU WANT TO 
BET AFTER NINETY MINUTES HE WILL TAKE 
HIS TRACKSUIT OFF AFTER TWENTY MINUTES 
HE MIGHT PUT SOME GLOVES ON 
IF WE 
GET THERE BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT 
EVEN THE GRANDSONS AS THE PITCH IS 
DODGY WHAT KIND OF FOOTBALL WILL 
WE SEE 
THEY HAVE RELAY THE PITCH 
TWICE AND IT IS APPARENTLY STILL IN 
A TERRIBLE STATE THAT MAY BE IN 
CHELSEA'S ADVANTAGE SOME PLAYERS 
SAY IT IS A DISGRACE AND UNDULATING 
YOU HAVE A FINAL IN MOSCOW AND 
WHERE FANS HAVE TROUBLE GETTING TO 
YOU HAVE A KICK OFF TIME AT TEN FORTY FIVE P. M. 
LOCAL TIME SO THE USING SECTION OF 
SUPPORT WILL BE UNHAPPY IT IS NOT 
AN IDEAL SITUATION MOSCOW IS DOING 
ITS BEST TO GIVE US ANYTHING BUT A 
SPECTACLE 
TICKETS A DISASTER FOR SPECTACLE THE RUSSIAN FOOTBALL FEDERATION 
IT IS A DISASTER THEY HAVE 
PROMISED EVERYTHING AND IT LOOKS 
LIKE THEY WILL COME VERY SHORT A A NEW MEMBER ALONSO'S GOAL WAS IT OR 
WAS IT NOT OVER THE LINE YOU 
REMEMBER IT WILL HE FEEL ANY PANGS 
OF GUILT AND ANY DECISIONS MADE GO 
IF MADE THEIR CHELSEA'S WAY NO NO AVRAM GRANT IS STILL THERE WERE WERE ARE THEY EDGING AT THE MOMENT YOU 
STILL HAVE TO SAY THAT THEY MAY 
HAVE HAD AN INCREDIBLE SEASON BUT 
CHELSEA ARE STILL A GROUP OF 
INDIVIDUALS TO MANCHESTER UNITED'S 
TEAM 
HALF OF THE CHELSEA TEAM ARE TEAM HAVING DISCUSSIONS THERE ARE MORE 
AGENTS IN AND OUT THAN THERE HAVE 
EVER BEEN ON PAPER THERE IS A 
MISMATCH AND CHELSEA HAVE NO CHANCE 
THEY ARE EIGHTEEN IN RUIN ON PAPER I I AGREE BUT ON THE NIGHT THEY CAN 
PERFORM AVRAM GRANT'S FUTURE IS IN 
DOUBT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT NEW 
CONTRACTS BUT THAT WILL BE FOR 
NEXT SEASON 
IT WILL PROBABLY WORK 
TO THEIR ADVANTAGE BRIEFLY WILL 
AVRAM GRANT STILL BE MANAGING 
CHELSEA NEXT SEASON THE HAVE 
ANSWERED THAT ABOUT FIFTEEN TIMES 
SO CAN BLOUSES AND BUDDHISM HAVE 
PLAYED A BIRDIE JUSTIN ROSE USES 
BUDDHIST CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES TO 
APPEASE THEM AND WILL BE HOPING 
THEIR PAY OFF IN THIS WEEK'S P. G. A. 
HIS CAREER HAS HAD UPS AND DOWNS 
HE CAME FOURTH IN THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT OPEN AT 
ROYAL BIRKDALE AND LAST YEAR HE 
WON THE EUROPEAN TOUR ORDER OF 
MERIT BUT HE HAS ALSO HAD TO COPE 
WITH THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER AND A 
RECENT SLIDE IN HIS FORM L. WALK 
THE FAIRWAYS WITH HIM ON HIS FIRST 
VISIT BACK TO BIRKDALE IN TEN YEARS 
I WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD GOLF HAS BEEN 
MY LIFE SINCE I WAS VERY YOUNG BY 
IT ALWAYS HAD THE DREAM OF BEING A 
PRO GOLFER IF I LOOK AT BIRKDALE 
MY MEMORIES ARE FROM WATCHING IT ON 
T. V. AT THE TIME IT WAS A BLUR FOR 
ME I WAS RIDING THE CREST OF WAVE GET IN THEY CRY 
THIS IS THE WEDGE THE FAMOUS WEDGE 
IT HAS BEEN GREAT COMING BACK WHILE 
IT HAS BEEN QUIET YOU CAN 
REMINISCE IN PEACE 
CHOIR BEFORE 
THE STORM ARE YOU GOING TO DO YOUR 
PHOTO SHOOT YES 
CAN I TAG ALONG YES YEAH 
JUSTIN ROSE 
THE WINNER OF YEAH THE TWO DOZEN SEVEN EUROPEAN TOUR 
ORDER OF MERIT IS NOW EN ROUTE TO 
FULFILLING THE IMMENSE PROMISE HE 
SHOWED CASE TEN YEARS AGO AS A SEVENTEEN 
YEAR OLD AMATEUR AT THE OPEN 
CHAMPIONSHIP AT THAT EVENT HE 
LEFT THE WORLD OF GOLF WITH AN 
EVERLASTING MEMORY 
TOUCHED WITH 
GREATNESS WHAT A WAY TO FINISH I I CAME DOWN THE LAST HOLE AND I 
REMEMBER SIZING UP THE LEADERBOARD 
GOING EVEN IF I MAKE A TRIPLE 
BOGEY I WILL FINISH TOP 
SO 
THERE WAS NO PRESSURE ON THE 
FAIRY TALE ENDING L. DID NOT EXPECT 
TO GET THAT CLOSE BECAUSE IT WAS A 
DIFFICULT SHOT FROM THE LEFT SIDE 
BUT IT CAME OUT PERFECTLY AND THE 
REST IS HISTORY L. WAS A BIT 
EMBARRASSED AT HOW I FINISHED IT 
WAS SO RIDICULOUS 
AND THE APPLAUSE 
WAS GOING MENTAL 
YEAH PEOPLE 
STILL SAY IT IS THE LADDISH RAW 
THEY HAVE HEARD ON A GOLF COURSE 
TIMMY THAT WAS THE TO ME THAT 
WAS THE WHOLE THING STANDING 
OVATION ON EVERY GREEN VIRTUALLY 
THERE IS HIS FATHER IT IS MOMENTS 
LIKE THIS THAT MAKE IT ALL 
WORTHWHILE 
I READ THAT 
YOU SAID WORTHWHILE YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT YOUR GRIEF 
OVER YOUR DAD AND HOW YOU HAVE COME 
TO TERMS WITH IT HE IS OBVIOUSLY 
WITH YOU ALL THE TIME ON THIS 
JOURNEY 
THE FIRST THING IS THE JOURNEY CELL FOR THAT SILVER MEDAL BENDY 
TOP FIFTEEN THEN WHO KNOWS A SHOT AT 
THE MAGIC MOMENT 
I THINK HE IS 
THERE WHEN I AM QUESTIONING 
SOMETHING IF I AM THINKING WHAT 
WOULD MY DAD DO HE ALSO ALWAYS 
FELT THAT I WOULD DO THE RIGHT 
THING FOR ME OUR TIME TOGETHER 
WAS QUALITY NOT QUANTITY WE HAD 
TWENTY ONE GREAT YEARS AND HE MADE ME THE 
MAN I AM TODAY 
YOU HAVE A DEFINITE PLAN ABOUT WAY 
YOU SEE YOURSELF THAT WHAT POINT IN 
YOUR LIFE ARE YOU ON TRACK 
I FEEL 
COMFORTABLE ON THE LEADERBOARD L. 
DON'T FEEL OUT OF MY DEPTH IT IS 
NOT UNNERVES THING OR ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT WHAT I FELT AT AUGUSTA IS 
THAT I WANTED IT A LITTLE BIT TOO 
MUCH AND I GOT TO AHEAD OF MYSELF 
I WAS PUTTING TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON 
MYSELF TOO EARLY IN THE TOURNAMENT 
FOUR DAYS IS SUCH A LONG TIME TO 
KEEP YOUR TO KEEP IN THE MOMENT 
TREVOR HIM MORE THAN LIVES WHERE I 
DO IN AMERICA L. WENT ROUND THERE 
THE OTHER DAY TO HAVE A CHAT WITH 
HIM THE FIRST THING HE SAID TO ME 
WAS THAT IT WAS THE WEIRDEST WEEK 
HE HAD NEVER FELT IN A MOMENT LIKE 
THAT IN HIS WHOLE CAREER HE LOOKED 
INCREDIBLY FOCUSED AND THAT IS THE 
MINDSET YOU NEED 
YOU MAY THIS HUGE 
DECISION TO PLAY ON THE AMERICAN 
TOUR YOU MADE HAVE YOU BEEN 
VINDICATED 
YES I THINK I AM A VINDICATED BETTER PLAYER BECAUSE OF IT THAT 
WAS MY ONLY REASON FOR DOING IT 
HOW WILL I ACCELERATE MY PROCESS 
THE QUICKEST PLAYING IN AMERICA 
AGAINST THE BEST PLAYERS ON 
POTENTIALLY TOUGHER COURSES I 
THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ME 
I THINK THAT HAS TRANSLATED INTO 
THE MAJOR TOURNAMENTS L. THINK I 
HAVE GONE TO THE MAJORS AND 
PERFORMED MORE CONSISTENTLY THAN A 
LOT OF MY PEERS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN 
IN AMERICA AND USED TO PLAYING WITH 
THE BIGGEST NAMES IN THE WORLD L. 
HAVE BEEN USED TO PLAYING IN FRONT 
OF BIG CROWDS BEING IN THE ZONE 
THE REAL ABILITY IS BEING ABLE TO 
COME IN AND OUT OF IT YOU CANNOT 
BE INTENSE FOR FOUR DAYS OR I 
CANNOT I PLAY MY BEST GOLF WHEN I 
AM RELAXED TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
COME IN AND OUT OF MY FOCUS 
AFTER I HAVE IT MY SHOT I CHAT 
WITH MY CADDIE AND GET BACK INTO 
MIKE NEXT SHOT L. COME OUT OF IT 
AGAIN THAT IS WHEN I AM PLAYING 
REALLY WELL MY NEXT SHOT GREAT GREAT TEMPO 
LAST YEAR YOU HAD A GREAT TEMPO YEAR YOU MUST HAVE FELT THAT IT 
WAS ALL GOING TO PLAN 
IT IS 
INTERESTING I FELT VERY SETTLED 
LAST YEAR L. GOT MARRIED I CHANGED 
MANAGEMENT I CHANGED CADDIE I 
CHANGED A FEW THINGS L. HAD A GREAT 
TEAM OF PEOPLE AROUND ME L. FELT 
SETTLED LIKE YOU SAY WHEN YOU ARE 
HAPPY OFF THE COURSE YOU PLAY WELL 
THIS YEAR I HAVE GOT A BIT TOO BUSY 
WITH MY PRACTICE AND MAY BE ADDING 
ONE OR TWO MORE PEOPLE INTO THE 
TEAM 
TOO MUCH PRACTICE 
MAYBE TOO TEAM BUSY IN MY OWN HEAD 
FOCUS KEEPS 
COMING UP AND YOUR COACH HAS 
INTRODUCED SOME BUDDHIST MEDITATION 
TECHNIQUES THAT IS TO HELP YOU 
ACHIEVE THAT IN THE MOMENT FEELING 
WHAT DO THEY INVOLVE 
IT IS QUIET 
TIME GETTING AWAY FROM EVERYTHING 
AND HAVING TIME TO THINK BREATHING 
AND VISUALISATION A LITTLE BIT OF 
MEDITATION OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO 
CALL IT SOME QUIET TIME WHEN YOU 
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO 
ACHIEVE 
TIGER WOODS USED HIS ACHIEVE BUDDHISM USES A BUDDHISM 
IT IS 
SOMETHING HE HAS NEVER DIVULGED 
WITH HIS MUM'S BACKGROUND THERE IS 
A HUGE MENTAL EMPHASIS WITH HIM 
SOON IT THERE WILL BE SOME KIND OF 
BUDDHIST CORNER WHERE ALL THE 
GOLFERS GO TO RELAX GO 
HE WANTS IT TO GO IT DID NOT GO CARRY 
PRESSURE IS ALWAYS SELF CARRY INFLICTED THAT IS WHAT WINNING THE 
OPEN MEANS TO YOU THAT IS WHERE 
PRESSURE COMES FROM 
NICK FALDO 
SAID THAT IN AUGUSTA THE YOUNG 
BRITISH PLAYERS NEED TO BE STRONGER 
MENTALLY DID YOU KNOW HE SAID 
THAT 
NO L. L. CAN SEE WHERE HE IS THAT COMING FROM NICK ONLY LEARNED THAT 
IN HIS LATE TWENTIES AND EARLY THIRTIES 
HE DID HAVE THE MENTAL DISCIPLINE 
AND SINGLE MINDEDNESS TO GO AHEAD 
AND MAKE THOSE CHANGES L. THINK 
SOMETIMES IT JUST HAPPENS WHEN YOU 
MATURE AND GET OLDER 
THE RYDER CUP 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT 
I THINK IT 
WILL BE A VERY EXPLOSIVE RYDER CUP 
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE TEAM L. 
HAVE GOT OFF TO A GOOD START L. 
WOULD LIKE TO GO INTO THE RYDER CUP 
PLAYING WELL NOT JUST HAVING MADE 
THE TEAM 
THIS IS YOUR DIVOT 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 
REPLICATE MY SHOT 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
DIGGING UP THE EARTH DID YOU HAVE 
THAT GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND I I HAD THIS GOING ON 
YOU HAVE GONE FOR THE CHEEKY CHIP 
AND RUN THAT IS EXCELLENT THAT THAT WOULD NOT HAVE GOT ANY APPLAUSE OR 
A STANDING OVATION 
IT JUST SHOWS 
HOW LUCKY I GOT 
NO THE START OF A 
GREAT JOURNEY AND MAKE IT GO ON 
THANK YOU THANK YOU 
SO EMBARRASSING TAKING A GOLF SHOT 
IN FRONT OF MAN LIKE JUSTIN ROSE 
WHAT A GREAT MAN HE IS HE HAS HAD 
A RISE AND FALL OVER THE LAST FEW 
YEARS HE ALMOST GOT BACK ON TRACK 
LAST YEAR COULD THIS STILL BE HIS 
YEAR 
IT COULD BE THE BUDDHIST YEAR MEDITATION THE FEROCIOUS TRAINING 
REGIME MAXIMISING THE POINTS HE 
EARNS HE IS FOLLOWING TIGER WOODS 
THE NEW GENERATION OF EUROPEAN 
GOLFERS ARE MOVING TO THE AMERICA 
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT IS THEIR 
BEST CHANCE OF MOVING WINNING 
MAJORS THEY HAVE TO OVERTAKE TIGER 
WOODS THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT AWAY 
FROM THAT AT THE MOMENT 
HE IS ONE 
OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BRITISH 
SWIMMERS OF ALL TIME AND AT THE 
AGE OF THIRTY EIGHT HE IS YET TO WIN AN 
OLYMPIC MEDAL MARK FOSTER IS 
AIMING TO CHANGE THAT HE WILL BE 
WEARING A NEW CONTROVERSIAL 
SWIMSUIT AS MATTHEW PINSENT 
DISCOVERED THERE IS MORE TO 
SWIMMING THAN A SWIMSUIT 
I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED THE TRAINING 
SIDE OF THINGS AND I LOVED STANDING 
ON A BLOCK RACING PEOPLE L. LOVE 
THAT CHALLENGE FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN 
MONTHS I TOOK SOME TIME OFF AND I 
WENT TO THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS 
I TRAINED SOMEBODY ELSE AND THEY 
WERE COMPETING AND I WENT FOR FUN 
I THOUGHT WHILE THE MIND AND BODY 
WERE STILL WINNING WILLING I 
WOULD HAVE ANOTHER GO 
WHEN I IMAGINED WAY YOU LIVED I 
IMAGINED A KIND OF LOFT APARTMENT 
VERY MODERN AND YOU ARE NOT YOU 
ARE LORD OF THE MANOR L. LOOK AT 
YOU AND I THINK YOU ARE A MODEL IN 
THE OLYMPICS CHISELLED YOU HAVE 
YOUR SLIPPERS ON AND SITTING IN 
FRONT OF ANTIQUES ROADSHOW IN YOUR 
SITTING ROOM 
MOST OF MY TIME AT 
HOME WOULD BE SPENT BY THE WALKING 
THE DOGS SITTING IN FRONT OF THE 
TELEVISION OR GOING OUT ON THE 
GOLF COURSE L. DON'T LIVE AND 
BREATHE SWIMMING L. HAVE TO HAVE 
DISTRACTIONS I WOULD DEFINITELY 
HAVE NOT CONTINUED TO THE AGE OF THIRTY SEVEN 
OR THIRTY EIGHT HAD IT HAD I NOT HAD THAT 
MINDSET 
MARK FOSTER HIS FIRST MINDSET JUST FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND THE 
FASTEST MAN IN WATER IN GREAT 
BRITAIN AND THE GREAT PROSPECT FOR 
INTERNATIONAL SWIMMING SPRINTING 
THIS BOY IS 
I ALWAYS WISH THAT I 
KNEW THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW WHEN I 
WAS EIGHTEEN I WAS VERY GOOD AT WHAT I 
DID MY FRIENDS HAD MORE OTHER 
SOCIAL LIFE L. NEVER LOOKED AT THE 
OLYMPICS AND THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE 
TO MAKE A CAREER OUT OF THIS L. DID 
IT BECAUSE I ENJOYED DOING IT AND I 
WAS GOOD AT IT THAT IS WHY YOU GET 
INTO SPORT BECAUSE YOU LOVE IT 
UNBELIEVABLE 
FOURTH HE HAS WON IT UNBELIEVABLE ANOTHER GOLD MEDAL FOR THE GREAT 
BRITISH TEAM 
THE GRAND OLD MAN OF 
THE POOL HAS DONE IT 
IF YOU ARE ON 
WORLD RECORD TIME CAN YOU TELL 
DURING THAT PERIOD IN THE RACE THAT 
IT IS GOOD 
I NEVER HAD A COACH 
THAT WOULD SAY TO ME THAT YOU ARE 
DOING THIS WRONG OR THAT WRONG L. 
GENERALLY COACHED AT MYSELF OR HAD 
OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THE BUT 
TECHNICALLY IT WOULD BE DOWN TO ME 
AROUND ME IT WAS ONLY WHEN I 
TOOK THOSE TWO YEARS OUT I ASKED 
MYSELF WHY I DID THAT BECAUSE IT 
MADE NO SENSE WHAT I WAS DOING 
TECHNICALLY WAS NOT VERY GOOD WAS WAS THAT THE TRICK YOU FEEL YOU MIGHT 
HAVE MISSED EARLIER IN YOUR CAREER 
YES WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE IF 
I HAD KNOWN WHAT I KNOW NOW BACK 
THEN AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
REGRETS I HAD IN MY CAREER I WISH 
I HAD GONE TO BED AMERICAN 
UNIVERSITY AND BEEN IN THAT SYSTEM 
AN AMERICAN UNIVERSITY WHAT WE 
HAVE IN THE STATES IS SO FAR AHEAD 
OF WHAT WE HAVE HERE IF WE HAD 
THAT HERE EVERY SPORT WOULD BE SO 
MUCH BETTER 
YOU COMBINED 
LATER ON 
DID THAT 
COME ABOUT 
I HAVE BEEN GOOD 
FRIENDS WITH COLIN JACKSON FOR 
YEARS IT WAS AFTER THE SYDNEY 
OLYMPICS IN TWO THOUSAND WE WERE TALKING 
THERE WERE ELEMENTS OF ATHLETICS 
THAT CROSSOVER WITH SWIMMING IN 
THE GYM I STARTED TRAINING MORE AS 
AN ATHLETE CIRCUIT TRAINING 
WEIGHT TRAINING AN OLD COACH OF 
MINE SAID TO ME WHEN YOU WALK OUT 
THERE TODAY DO THIS L. WAS IN THE 
COOL ROOM THINKING NOT BEING 
FUNNY HE HAS NEVER STOOD IN FRONT 
OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH TWENTY SECONDS TO 
DO THE BUSINESS WHEN IT CAME FROM 
COLIN JACKSON I KNEW HE HAD STOOD 
THERE IN FRONT OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
AND HE HAD SEVEN OTHER PEOPLE TO DO 
IT WITH L. LEARNT MORE FROM HIM THAN I DID FROM ANY OF MY COACHES 
PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE 
PERFECT RACE L. KNOW THEIR REACTION 
HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD MY REACTION 
I AIM TO ONLY BREATHE ONCE AND THE 
FINISH IS SO IMPORTANT THERE IS 
NOT A POINT AT WHERE I SAID THAT 
WAS PERFECT 
NOW WE HAVE GOT THE 
LATEST CONTROVERSY TALK US THROUGH 
THE WONDERFUL INZE AND OUT OF THESE 
SUITS 
THE MAIN THING IS FIRST AND SUITS FOREMOST BODY SUITS WERE 
INTRODUCED TO BE COMPRESSED AND 
TYKE SO YOU ARE MORE STREAMLINED 
THROUGH THE WATER THAT IS THE MAIN 
ADVANTAGE ON TOP THEY DO THIS 
WITH NASA WHERE ALL THE TURBULENCE 
WAS ON THE SUIT UNDERNEATH THE 
WATER THEY PUT THESE SILICON 
PATCHES TO MAKE YOU MORE EFFICIENT 
THOSE SUITS ARE RIPPING THEIR WAY 
THROUGH THE WORLD RECORDS 
AT THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS I WORE THE 
OLDER SUIT AND CAME SECOND IT IS 
NOT ALL ABOUT THE SUIT IT IS ABOUT 
THE PERSON IN THE SUIT AS WELL BUT 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT COME THE 
OLYMPICS IN BEIJING I WILL BE 
WEARING THE SUIT YOU WOULD THINK 
THAT YOU ARE GAMBLING AGAINST THE 
SUIT MANUFACTURER IF YOU DO NOT 
WEAR IT 
AS THIS WHEN A CAR YOU WANT TO WEAR 
THE BEST SUIT FOR YOU IF IT MAKES 
ONE OR TWO PER CENT DIFFERENCE YOU MIGHT AS 
WELL 
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS SWIMSUIT 
WHY IS IT CAUSING SO MUCH 
KERFUFFLE IT HAS BECOME A 
CONTROVERSIAL PIECE OF KIT FOR 
SOMETHING THAT LOOKS INNOCUOUS BE BE IT IS AS HE SAYS ABOUT THREE PER CENT FASTER 
BUT WHAT IS REALLY WRONG WITH IT IS 
THAT ALL OF THE OTHER LEADING 
SPORTING SWIMWEAR BRANDS INCLUDING 
THE ONES THE CHINESE AND JAPANESE 
SWIM IN HAVE NOT GOT THE 
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS THE REAL 
PROBLEM THE COMPANY INVOLVED HERE 
ARE IN FRONT OF THE OTHERS SO SO SPEEDO HAVE MADE THIS SUIT AND ARE 
SELLING IT ON THE MARKET AND 
SWIMMERS IN THE SUIT ARE DOING 
BETTER BREAKING RECORDS 
THAT IS 
RIGHT BUT THAT IS NOT THE TRUE 
OLYMPIC IDEAL THE OLYMPIC IDEAL IS 
WORKING ON THE SAME PLAYING FIELD 
BUT IF YOUR BIKE IS TECHNOLOGICALLY 
BETTER THAT IS NO DIFFERENT BUT BUT THERE ARE PATENTED TECHNOLOGIES IN 
THIS WHICH PREVENT OTHER PEOPLE 
FROM JOINING IN BECAUSE THEY LOSE 
THEIR SPONSORSHIP CONTRACTS ALSO 
HOW FAR IT HAS EQUIPMENT PLAY A 
PART IN THIS KIND OF SPORT THIS IS 
WHERE HUNDREDTHS OF A SECOND ARE 
CRUCIAL COULD THE EQUIPMENT BE 
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE 
PARTICIPANTS 
BUT IF WHAT MARK PARTICIPANTS FOSTER IS SAYING IS THAT OVER FIFTY 
METRES IT IS MAKING UP HALF A 
SECOND THAT IS SENSATIONAL OVER 
FOUR HUNDRED IT WILL BE MORE THEY HAVE B. THIRTY EIGHT 
RECORDS SET IN THIS SUIT NINETEEN IN 
LONG COURSE NINETEEN IN A SHORT COURSE 
THAT TELLS YOU THAT IT IS THE ONLY 
WAY 
WHICH IS WHY NIKE AND OTHER WAY BRANDS ARE WORKING TWENTY FOUR HOURS ROUND 
THE CLOCK 
AND ANY OTHER THE CLOCK MANUFACTURERS 
I AM SURE THERE ARE MANUFACTURERS A FEW MORE 
THE PARALYMPICS ARE ALSO BEING HELD 
IN BEIJING AND ONE SPORT WHERE WE 
HOPE FOR A MEDAL IS BLIND FOOTBALL 
BRITAIN IS BUILDING NEW STATE OF 
THE ART FACILITIES IN HEREFORD AND 
IT IS THERE THAT THE BRITISH SQUAD 
MET UP RECENTLY ALL THE PLAYERS 
ARE BLINDFOLDED IN CASE ANY CHEATS 
WITH ZERO VISION TAKE PART AND 
THEN THE GAME IS PLAYED WITH A 
SIGHTED GOALKEEPER AND COACHES ON 
THE TOUCHLINES DES HAS BEEN VERY 
BUSY THIS WEEK AND FOUND THAT IT 
IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS ON YOUR TOES BOYS COME ON 
MANY A TOP CLASS FOOTBALLER HAS 
BLAMED MISTAKE ON POOR 
COMMUNICATION BUT FOR BLIND 
FOOTBALL TEAM TALKING IS EVEN MORE 
CRUCIAL GREAT BRITAIN WILL BE 
REPRESENTED IN BLIND FOOTBALL FOR 
THE FIRST TIME AT THE PARALYMPICS 
IN BEIJING THE TEAM ARE BASED AT 
THE ROYAL NATIONAL COLLEGE FOR THE 
BLIND IN HEREFORD WHERE NEW WORLD 
CLASS FACILITIES ARE BEING BUILT 
FOR THE TWO THOUSAND TEN BLIND WORLD CUP 
THE THING THAT STRIKES ME FIRST IS 
THAT THEY HAVE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT 
OF FAITH IN THEMSELVES AND IN THE 
INSTRUCTIONS THEY ARE BEING GIVEN 
WE WORK A LOT ON COMMUNICATION 
CONCENTRATION AND COMMUNICATION ARE 
THE TWO MAIN THINGS WE HAVE ONLY 
FIVE PLAYERS PER TEAM IT IS UP TO 
DECIDED GOALKEEPER TO MODEL HIS 
PLAYERS ON THE SPECIALLY ADAPTED 
PITCH IN THE GAME ITSELF THEY GET 
ASSISTANCE FROM TONY WHO WORKS 
FROM OUTSIDE THE PITCH AND COVERS 
THAT MIDDLE THIRD 
GET BACK OUR OUR OWN GOALKEEPER COVERS THE DEFENCE 
AND I WORK BEHIND THE GOAL THEY ARE 
ATTACKING TO GET THEM INTO SHOOTING 
POSITION THAT IS HOW BLIND 
FOOTBALL WORKS 
DO YOU GET A LOT OF 
INJURIES 
THANKFULLY THERE ARE INJURIES VERY FEW INJURIES IN THE GAME 
ITSELF IF YOU HAVE GOT THE BALL 
ANYONE APPROACHING YOU FROM THE 
OTHER SIDE MUST USE THE WORD VOID 
AN INTERNATIONAL WOULD EVERYBODY 
USES IF THEY FAIL TO DO THAT THEY 
ARE PENALISED 
IS IT EASIER IF YOU 
HAVE BEEN SIGHTED AT SOME POINT I I HAVE BEEN BLIND SINCE BIRTH FOR ME 
COS I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN USED TO IT 
IT HAS COME NATURAL TO ME BUT FOR 
SOME IT IS THE OPPOSITE 
THERE ARE 
VARIED ARGUMENTS ON IT BUT HIS 
AUDITORY SKILLS ARE WAY BETTER THAN 
MINE I AM LUCKY THAT I COME FROM A 
DECENT STANDARD OF FOOTBALL WHERE I 
HAVE SEEN THE GAME SO IT IS EASY 
TO JUMP IN AFTER LOSING YOUR SITE 
SO IT YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF RUNNING 
AND THE MOVES 
YEAH YOU SENSE THE 
SOUND COMING OFF THE WALL AND THE 
SOUND SHADOWS YOU CAN SENSE YOUR 
FOOTSTEPS MAKING NOISE OF THE BALL 
I WAS IMPRESSED BY YOUR BALL 
CONTROL THAT IS OBVIOUSLY KEY TO 
THE GAME TO KEEP THE BALL CLOSE 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT CLOSE TO YOUR 
FEET YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT CLOSE 
OTHERWISE YOU WILL NOT HEAR WHERE 
IT GOES 
HOW DO YOU CHEAT L. NEED 
TO KNOW A FEW TRICKS 
YOU HAVE GOT 
TO COMMUNICATE 
SO YOU ARE TAKING 
THE TEAM TO BEIJING THAT WILL 
PRESENT CHALLENGE 
IT IS EXCITING 
WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT IT IS 
ABOUT MAKING SURE THE PLAYERS STAY 
RELAXED AND FOCUSED WE ARE GOING 
TO TRY AND GET ON THE PODIUM 
WATCHING FROM THE TOUCHLINE THIS 
SEEMS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BUT THERE 
IS ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT IS 
REALLY LIKE AND THAT IS TO TRY FOR 
YOURSELF 
KEEP COMING JOB ON THE YOURSELF SPOT JOG ON THE SPOT TAKE YOUR 
BLINDFOLD OFF A SECOND JUST LIFT 
IT YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY BE HERE 
COME AROUND ME KEEP COMING ANDY ANDY LOOKS LIKE LIONEL MESSI THE WAY HE 
KEEPS THE BALL CLOSE TO HIM HE IS 
GOING ROUND HIS COACH L. HAVE 
FILLED AT BBC INSURANCE FORMS L. 
CANNOT FIND IT NO CLUE WHAT WAS 
GOING ON BLOODY HELL 
IF KEEP 
COMING TO MY VOICE KEEP COMING 
KEEP YOUR FOOT ON THE BALL BRING 
IT INTO THE GOAL SHOOT 
WHAT CAN I 
SAY LIONEL MESSI 
IT 
WAS MESSY IT IT WAS AN EDUCATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH MUCH TOUGH DES 
THE IT WAS NOT PRETTY 
WAS IT WE ARE LUCKY IN THIS JOB 
WE MEET A LOT OF SPORTS PEOPLE AND 
THEY WERE AN INSPIRATIONAL BUNCH 
THEY TAUGHT ME A LESSON THEY WILL 
BE TUNED IN FOR THEIR BIG MOMENT L. 
MET THE F. A. CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND THE 
HEAD OF COMMUNICATIONS AND THEY 
HAVE ARRANGED FOR THE SQUAD TO MEET 
THE FULL ENGLAND TEAM SO IF YOU 
THOUGHT I WAS PRETTY BAD I WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE WHAT WAYNE ROONEY IS 
LIKE WITH A BLINDFOLD ON 
WE WILL 
SEE IF WE CAN ARRANGE THAT FOR THE 
NEXT SERIES 
OTHER NEWS FOR THE PARALYMPICS AND

RIGHT TO QUALIFY AS AN ABLE BODIED
