IN LATE OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EDWYN COLLINS PLAYED A GIG AT THE B. B. C.'S ELECTRIC PROMS 
THIS PERFORMANCE WAS A CLIMAX TO ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE COMEBACKS THE MUSIC BUSINESS HAS EVER SEEN 
AND THE REALISATION OF AN AMBITION THAT HELPED CARRY HIM THROUGH 
THE THREE MOST CHALLENGING YEARS OF HIS LIFE 
I CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT 
EDWYN'S MUSICAL CAREER BEGAN IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES 
WHEN HE FRONTED GLASGOW BAND ORANGE JUICE TO HUGE CRITICAL ACCLAIM 
WHAT PRESENCE 
THEY WERE JUST SO FRESH AND YOUNG AND INTERESTING 
YOU KNOW ME I'M ACTING DUMB DUMB 
THE COMPLETE ARCH AND THE FEYNESS OF IT AS WELL AS THE GREAT MUSIC 
MEANT THAT GUYS COULD BE UTTERLY CHARMING AND UTTERLY STUPID 
AND UTTERLY INTELLIGENT ALL AT ONCE 
ONE OF THE BEST RECORDS THIS YEAR EDWYN COLLINS 
EDWYN COLLINS EDWYN COLLINS WITH THE EXCELLENT A GIRL LIKE YOU 
I'VE NEVER MET A GIRL LIKE YOU BEFORE 
AFTER GOING SOLO IN THE MID EIGHTIES 
EDWYN HAD A WORLDWIDE BREAK OUT HIT IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WITH THE SINGLE A GIRL LIKE YOU 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE VERY VERY PLEASED FOR EDWYN 
WHO ADMIRED WHAT HE'D DONE 
HE WAS A GOOD GUY 
AND HE HADN'T HAD ANY HUGE GREAT COMMERCIAL SUCCESS UP TILL THEN 
THERE WAS A BIT OF PUNK IN THERE THERE WAS A BIT OF NORTHERN SOUL 
A BIT OF THE VELVET UNDERGROUND A BIT OF MOTOWN 
HE'D ABSORBED ALL THESE DIFFERENT BRILLIANT BITS OF POP 
AND PUT THEM TOGETHER INTO A KIND OF UNIQUE WHOLE 
IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHILE HE WAS WORKING ON HIS TENTH STUDIO ALBUM EDWYN'S LIFE CHANGED FOREVER 
I HAD A STROKE YOU KNOW 
AND ER 
IT'S 
SIX MONTHS IN HOSPITAL AND ER 
IT'S TERRIBLE FOR ME 
IT'S AFFECTING MY LIFE 
I COULDN'T WALK 
AND IT'S TRUE THAT I'M LEARNING A LOT OF THINGS 
LIKE BRUSHING MY TEETH 
IT'S TRAGIC 
DO YOU REMEMBER BEFORE YOU WERE ILL 
VAGUELY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO 
ERM 
I DON'T KNOW SORRY 
I'VE REACHED THIS DESTINATION 
BUT IT'S FUNNY 
I DON'T RECOGNISE THE SIGN 
IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND FIVE EDWYN HAD A BRAIN HAEMORRHAGE QUICKLY FOLLOWED BY A SECOND 
WITHOUT AN OPERATION TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE ON HIS BRAIN HE WOULD HAVE DIED 
WHEN HE WOKE UP IN HOSPITAL HE COULDN'T READ WRITE WALK OR TALK 
HIS WIFE GRACE HAS BEEN WITH HIM THROUGHOUT 
IT'S QUITE SURREAL THINKING BACK 
THEY TOLD US THAT THERE WAS 
A BIG RISK THAT HE WOULD HAVE ANOTHER BLEED AND IT WAS A WAITING GAME I SUPPOSE 
THAT WAS THE SUNDAY AND THE THING WE'D BEEN HOPING WOULDN'T HAPPEN 
DID HAPPEN AND HE HAD ANOTHER BLEED 
THINGS LOOKED PRETTY GRIM 
WE WERE MET BY A DOCTOR WHO TOLD US THAT THEY'D DECIDED TO 
OPERATE OPERATE ON YOU LOVE YEAH 
AND TRY TO REMOVE THE BLEED 
SO OFF HE WENT AND AS FOR YOUR OUTCOME 
THEY WEREN'T REALLY MAKING MANY PREDICTIONS LONG TERM 
BUT YOUR LIFE WAS STILL SOMEWHAT HANGING 
ON THE BALANCE YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BUT WE HAD YOU KNOW REALLY FROM THAT POINT ON IT WAS VERY VERY 
YOU KNOW IT WAS THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES 
IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN WE STARTED TO FOLLOW EDWYN HIS DYSPHASIA WHICH RUPTURES THE PATHWAYS 
BETWEEN THOUGHT AND SPEECH WAS MAKING IT HARD FOR HIM TO CONSTRUCT FULL SENTENCES 
WHAT ARE YOUR GOALS FOR THE NEXT YEAR 
THE GOALS TO UNDERSTAND 
TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE UM 
THE NECESSARY GOALS 
TO READ AGAIN TO WRITE AGAIN TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GUITAR 
I DON'T KNOW 
POSSIBLY 
UM HERE'S MY GUITARS 
THE FENDER THE GRETSCH THE GIBSON 
THE EPIPHONE 
THE EFFECTS OF EDWYN'S STROKE IN PARTICULAR THE LOSS OF THE USE OF HIS RIGHT ARM 
HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR HIS MUSICAL CAREER AND HE'S NOT SURE HE'LL EVER WORK AGAIN 
MY HANDS ARE TIED AT THE MOMENT 
NO MOVEMENT AT ALL 
THERE IT'S HARD FOR ME TO CONCENTRATE ON THE GUITAR 
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL WRITE SONGS AGAIN 
YES I'M 
I'M SEARCHING FOR THE TRUTH 
I'M SEARCHING FOR THE TRUTH 
SOME SWEET DAY 
WE'LL GET THERE IN THE END 
SOME SWEET DAY 
WE'LL GET THERE IN THE END 
THE GREAT 
EDWYN WROTE THAT 
I'M HOPING FOR THE TRUTH 
I'M HOPING FOR THE TRUTH 
SOME SWEET DAY 
WE'LL GET THERE IN THE END 
NO NO NO IS THAT WRONG 
TOO SLOW TOO FAST 
YES SLOW DOWN YES SLOW DOWN 
CERTAINLY YOUR HIGHNESS 
I'M MAGNIFICENT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU 
HOPELESS 
O. K. WANT US TO DO IT AGAIN YEAH 
I THINK I'VE BEEN COPING WITH IT 
YES 
I THINK WE'RE ALL RIGHT AREN'T WE YES YES 
IT'S WEIRD NO DOUBT ABOUT IT 
YOUR LIFE IS CHANGED 
UPSIDE DOWN TOTALLY YEAH 
IN AN INSTANT 
BUT EDWYN SAYS IT SOMETIMES YOU'RE SORT OF RAILING AGAINST 
THE UNFAIRNESS OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW 
AND EDWYN WILL SAY I'M ALIVE 
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS 
I'M GLAD I'M ALIVE 
I'M GLAD I'M ALIVE 
GET ON WITH THINGS 
UPWARDS AND ONWARDS 
I'D RATHER FALL TO THE GROUND 
IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET AS MUCH OF HIS SPEECH AND MOVEMENT BACK AS POSSIBLE 
EDWYN HAS STARTED OUT ON AN INTENSIVE PROGRAMME OF THERAPY 
HE AND GRACE TRAVEL HALFWAY ACROSS LONDON 
THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR PHYSIOTHERAPY SESSIONS WITH ELLEN MCDONALD 
NICE BIG STEPS WALKING DOWN THE ROOM 
EDWYN LOST MUCH OF THE MOVEMENT AND FEELING IN HIS RIGHT SIDE AFTER HIS TWO STROKES 
THESE SESSIONS ARE VITAL IF HE IS EVER TO WALK EASILY AGAIN AND IF HE IS EVER TO PLAY THE GUITAR 
STANDING UP THROUGH THE RIGHT LEG REALLY PUSHING THROUGH THE RIGHT LEG HEEL DOWN 
THAT'S IT THAT'S IT GOOD 
I NEED TO SIT DOWN PLEASE 
WHEN I FIRST MET HIM HE WAS MOSTLY IN A WHEELCHAIR AND HE HAD A BIG SPLINT ON HIS LEG AS WELL 
WE'RE TRYING TO WEAN OFF THE STICK AND GET HIS BALANCE A BIT BETTER 
TRY TO STRAIGHTEN YOUR ARM WITH ME GO ON PUSH ME AWAY WITH THIS ARM 
GO ON LONG ARM LONG ARM LONG ARM LONG ARM GOOD GOOD GOOD GO GO GO 
ALL THE WAY OVER HERE REACH REACH REACH 
SORRY ELLEN IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YOUR ARM WAS DOING BEAUTIFUL THINGS THERE YEAH YEAH 
THERE'S A REACTION THERE 
DIFFICULTY WITH HIS ARM IS THE SENSATION REALLY 
IT'S DIFFICULT AFTER A STROKE BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE 
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN AFFECTED 
AND THEIR RECOVERY IS DIFFERENT 
WE DON'T LIKE TO TELL THEM HOW FAR THEY'LL GO 
JUST KEEP ENCOURAGING THEM 
AND KEEP MAKING THEM WORK AS HARD AS THEY CAN 
THE BELLS ARE RINGING ACROSS LONDON TOWN 
TOGETHER WITH THE FORMAL THERAPY SESSIONS 
IT'S THE CONSTANT ENCOURAGEMENT OF EDWYN'S WIFE GRACE 
THAT IS HELPING HIS RECOVERY 
SO WAS ELLEN KIND OF TOUGH ON YOU TODAY 
TOUGH ON ME SHE'S A NIGHTMARE 
I'LL TELL HER YOU SAID SO EDWYN 
WHEN SHE GOES BACK TO AUSTRALIA WHAT'LL WE DO 
I DON'T KNOW PANIC 
I'M CLEAR WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO 
YOU'RE CLEAR YES IN MY MIND 
POSITIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE 
NO FIGHTS YOU AND I O. K. 
D'YOU THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE I DON'T THINK SO 
IN THE LATE SEVENTIES AROUND THE TIME EDWYN FORMED ORANGE JUICE 
HE WAS WORKING AS AN ILLUSTRATOR IN THE GLASGOW PARKS DEPARTMENT 
HE HAS ALWAYS DRAWN BUT SINCE HIS STROKE LEFT HIM WITHOUT THE USE OF HIS RIGHT HAND 
HE HAS TAUGHT HIMSELF TO WORK WITH HIS LEFT 
THE WREN I'M NOT SO CRAZY ABOUT THAT 
I'M NOT SO HAPPY ABOUT THE GOOSE 
NOW AH THIS IS MORE LIKE IT 
THE TIGER I ALWAYS WANTED TO ILLUSTRATE 
THE TIGER IS BRILLIANT TO ME 
IT'S NOT IN YOUR MIND 
SINCE HE FELL ILL EDWYN HAS RECEIVED HUGE SUPPORT FROM HIS FANS 
AND MUCH OF IT HAS COME THROUGH HIS MYSPACE SITE THAT GRACE AND EDWYN'S SON WILLIAM SET UP FOR HIM 
AND WE ARE THINKING OF YOU 
FOR YOU IT'S A WAY BACK TO YOUR OLD LIFE TO TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT 
YOUR CAREER AND YOUR SONGS AND THE THINGS THAT THEY WRITE TO YOU 
YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU FEEL THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WRITE TO YOU 
TREAT YOU WITH RESPECT YEAH 
AND IT'S REALLY KIND ISN'T IT 
YES IT IS KIND AND APPRECIATED 
HE'S KIND OF ADDICTED TO IT 
IT'S KIND OF 
I'M NOT ALL RIGHT SO ER 
IN A WAY YOU ARE 
HE ALWAYS SHOUTS TO GRACE SOMETIMES COMPUTER PLEASE MYSPACE PLEASE 
OR HE SHOUTS OUT NO THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL THAT'S NOT TRUE 
YOU PROMISE THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL 
YES I PROMISE AWW LIAR 
AYE BUT THAT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENS 
HE'S A MYSPACE JUNKIE SHALL WE CALL IT 
IN A NICE WAY DAD 
I'LL TAKE A TRAIN I'LL TAKE A PLANE 
WAY UP NORTH WHERE THEY KNOW MY NAME 
WHERE THEY DON'T BUG ME THE WAY SOME FOLKS DO 
EDWYN HAS ALWAYS HAD CLOSE LINKS WITH THE TOWN OF HELMSDALE IN SUTHERLAND 
HE OWNS A HOUSE THERE THAT HAS BEEN IN HIS FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS 
AND MANY OF THE SONGS HE WAS WRITING WHEN HE FELL ILL ARE INSPIRED BY THE LANDSCAPE 
I CAME HERE AS A BOY 
AND I GREW UP HERE AND IT'S MY HOME AND IT'S MY LIFE 
SO I STOOD ON THE EDGE OF MY WORLD 
IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND FOUR EDWYN WAS FILMED WALKING THE WHALIGOE STEPS 
THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE STONE STEPS LEADING DOWN A SHEER CLIFF FACE TO THE SEA 
IT'S A MARK OF HIS PROGRESS THAT BY SPRING TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HE NOW FEELS READY TO TACKLE THEM AGAIN 
I REMEMBER YOU WERE IN HOSPITAL AND I USED TO SAY ONE DAY WE'LL GET YOU DOWN THE STEPS 
DON'T REMIND ME 
MORE IN HOPE THAN EXPECTATION THEN 
AND HERE WE ARE GONNA TRY IT YES 
DOWN TO THE SHORE 
THEY'RE VERY DRAMATIC BUT QUITE SAFE 
ARE THEY 
WELL WE'LL SEE HOW WE GO O. K. 
TAKE YOUR TIME LET ME GET AHEAD OF YOU LOVE 
SO I CAN TAKE YOUR WEIGHT THAT'S IT 
LET ME GET DOWN FIRST LOVE 
JUST A SECOND EDWYN OH YOU'RE A MONKEY STOP 
WHAT JUST TILL I GET STABILISED HERE LOVE 
WELL DONE 
DO YOU NEED A REST NO 
I'LL GIVE YOU A SHOUT IF I NEED A REST O. K. 
YEAH YEAH 
LET ME GET AHEAD OF YOU 
O. K. 
THIS IS MENTAL THAT WE'RE HERE ISN'T IT 
YEAH DO YOU THINK WE'RE MAD FOR TRYING THIS 
THERE'S WHERE YOU USED TO STAND OUT AND SHOW OFF WHAT 
DOWN THE END ON THOSE ROCKS AND YOU'D GO ALL THE WAY OUT 
AND GIVE ME THE HEEBIE JEEBIES HEEBIE JEEBIES 
I TOLD YOU WE'D DO THIS YOU WERE GOING IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN 
IF WE KEEP TRYING EVERYTHING 
THE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE IS GETTING BACK UP 
GHOST OF A CHANCE WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME THE 
GHOST GHOST OF A CHANCE 
THERE ARE MOMENTS OF GREAT TRIUMPH 
BUT MORE COMMON FOR EDWYN IS INCREMENTAL PROGRESS HE IS MAKING DAY TO DAY 
LEARNING TO READ AGAIN HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY TOUGH 
HEARD THE BOOKS 
NO NOT BOOKS 
BOOTS M. M. M. 
IT'S A REALLY SHOCKING THING NOBODY HAD ACTUALLY WARNED ME OR TOLD ME 
AND I TOOK A MAGAZINE IN THAT HAD AN ARTICLE ABOUT ORANGE JUICE IN IT 
AND I GAVE IT TO YOU AND AS YOU WERE LOOKING AT IT I THOUGHT 
HE CAN'T READ SHOCKING HE CAN'T READ 
HI TRUDI HI THERE HOW ARE YOU DOING FINE THANK YOU 
THE INTENSIVE THERAPY CONTINUES 
THREE TIMES A WEEK 
EDWYN IS VISITED AT HIS LONDON HOME BY HIS SPEECH THERAPIST TRUDI JENKINS 
O. K. SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT SOME ANAGRAMS 
SO I'M GOING TO TRY AND USE AS MUCH GUITAR KNOWLEDGE AS I HAVE O. K. 
WHICH IS ALL THAT I'VE LEARNED FROM YOU 
NO O. K. THIS IS A TYPE OF GUITAR 
SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT THE WORD 
UM F. FENDER GOT IT CAN YOU REARRANGE IT 
OH TUH TUH TUH TUH 
O. K. DOES IT LOOK RIGHT 
NO NO THERE'S TWO LETTERS ROUND THE WRONG WAY 
O. K. TUH TUH TUH 
TUH TUH TUH YEAH 
NOT QUITE THE OTHER WAY 
O. K. FENDER O. K. 
GREAT 
WITHIN YOUR LANGUAGE AREAS YOU HAVE A DICTIONARY OF WORDS WHICH YOU USE 
HIGH FREQUENCY WORDS THAT YOU WOULD USE EVERY DAY 
TO LOWER FREQUENCY WORDS 
THAT YOU MIGHT STRUGGLE A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR 
SO FOR EDWYN FOR INSTANCE 
HIS KNOWLEDGE AND VOCABULARY OF ANY KIND OF RECORDING EQUIPMENT 
HIS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
WHATEVER IT IS THAT HE WOULD HAVE CONCENTRATED ON A LOT BEFORE 
HAD A PASSION FOR BEFORE WOULD BE MUCH EASIER FOR HIM TO WORK ON NOW 
EDWYN'S WORKING TOWARDS A TIME WHEN HE CAN PLAY LIVE WITH HIS BAND AGAIN 
TODAY MID FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HE TAKES THE FIRST STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION 
LIVE IS GOD 
LIVE IS 
I'M SO HAPPY TO GET THERE 
THE WAY FORWARD IS RETURNING TO ME ONCE AGAIN 
HI EDWYN YEAH HI HI HI HI YOU ALL RIGHT 
YEAH YEAH WONDERFUL 
EDWYN HAS PRACTISED AT HOME 
BUT THIS IS THE VERY FIRST TIME HE HAS PLAYED WITH HIS BAND SINCE HE FELL ILL 
NO ONE KNOWS HOW THINGS WILL GO 
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO HIS NEW SONGS 
ONE 
IS A LONELY 
NUMBER 
ONE ONE ONE IS A LONELY NUMBER 
HMM PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT RIGHT GO ON 
I THINK HIS OLD SONGS THE ONES THAT HE WAS USED TO SINGING BEFORE 
WOULD BE MUCH EASIER FOR HIM 
I THINK NEW SONGS WOULD BE A BIT MORE TRICKY 
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT HE WOULD NECESSARILY BE UNABLE TO DO THAT 
I THINK WHERE THERE'S A WILL 
POOR OLD SOUL YEP YOU WERE A ROCKER 
YES 
BACK WITH A VENGEANCE MARCHING FORTH 
MY FRIEND THE HARLEQUIN THE ROGUE 
YOU COULDN'T HAVE MADE YOUR LIFE MORE DIFFICULT IF YOU'D BLOODY TRIED COULD YOU 
IT'S REALLY EASY WORDS IN'T IT 
I'VE FORGOTTEN THE WORDS A BIT BUT I'LL GET THERE 
IT'S FANTASTIC FOR ME 
IT'S REALLY ENJOYABLE FOR ME 
I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE SHOULD BUILD 
A CITY OF TEARS 
ALL I'M SAYING IS I'M ALONE 
AND CONSEQUENTLY 
ONLY MY DREAMS COULD SATISFY THE REAL NEED OF MY HEART 
I RESIST 
I THOUGHT IT WAS BRILLIANT ACTUALLY 
HE'S REALLY COMING ALONG I THINK WHEN YOU CONSIDER 
WE TALKED ABOUT DOING SOME MUSIC AND SINGING A FEW MONTHS AGO 
I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET IT TOGETHER FOR THEN 
ALL I'M SAYING IS I'M ALONE 
FALLING FALLING AND LAUGHING 
IT'S AMAZING AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS 
WE DID WONDER WHETHER IT WOULD EVER HAPPEN AGAIN 
I KNEW EDWYN WOULD BE DETERMINED TO HAVE A GO IT'S GREAT 
A FEW MORE PRACTICES 
AND IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE WE'RE OUT AND GIGGING AGAIN I THINK 
FALL FALLING FALLING AND LAUGHING 
FALLING AND LAUGHING FALLING AND LAUGHING 
WELL DONE CHILDREN 
YOU CAN SEE THE CHANGES ON THE OUTSIDE HE CAN SING YOU KNOW 
BE WITH HIS BAND HE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS 
THE REAL CHANGES I FEEL THAT I NOTICE ARE HAPPENING ON THE INSIDE 
NEVER MET A GIRL LIKE YOU BEFORE 
IT'S ABOUT INDEPENDENCE AND SEIZING CONTROL AGAIN 
AND TODAY IS JUST A REAL AMAZING STEP FORWARD IN THAT 
YEAH IT'S ALL RIGHT YEAH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
O. K. A FIVE SECOND INTRO INTO THAT 
TAPE SET 
IT'S JULY AND THE ALBUM THAT EDWYN RECORDED BEFORE HE FELL ILL IS FINISHED AND READY FOR RELEASE 
THE SINGLE HAS BEEN CHOSEN AND THERE'S A VIDEO TO BE MADE 
THIS TIME A YEAR AGO HE WAS TALKING ABOUT RETIRING 
AND SO THAT'S CLEARLY YOU'VE GOT BETTER AND BETTER SUFFICIENTLY TO HAVE THIS URGE TO 
SING AGAIN YEAH ONCE MORE YEAH 
YOU'RE VERY MOTIVATED TO WORK 
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THIS IS A BED OF ROSES 
BECAUSE WE FIGHT DON'T WE 
YES CONSTANTLY 
EVERY DAY 
THAT BAD YES 
THAT BAD 
TURN OVER RUNNING 
FROM THE BEGINNING 
NO EASY WINNINGS 
IT'S IN A MUDDLE 
AND THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH 
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW MY LOVE 
MY LOVE 
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW MY LOVE YOU'LL NEVER KNOW MY LOVE 
HE'S LOVELY IN PROFILE ISN'T HE YEAH 
EDWYN'S ENTHUSIASM WAS REALLY INSPIRING TODAY 
YOU CAN TELL HE'S EXCITED AND HIS LAUGHTER'S INFECTIOUS 
GOOD VIBE ALL ROUND ON THE CREW REALLY 
IT'S PRESSURE BUT I ENJOYED IT 
IT'S A GOOD SINGLE IT'S A STRONG SINGLE IT'S A POSITIVE SINGLE 
AND I'M HAPPY WITH YOU'LL NEVER KNOW MY LOVE 
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW YOU'LL NEVER KNOW 
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW MY LOVE 
HE'S BACK AT WORK AND HE'S REALLY REALLY ENJOYING IT 
HE'S REALLY THRIVING ON THIS I THINK IT'S AIDING HIS RECOVERY 
I KEEP CHECKING THAT HE'S NOT FEELING A BIT KNACKERED OR OVERWHELMED AND NO 
I THINK HE ABSOLUTELY THRIVES ON IT AND REALLY IT'S JUST MIRACULOUS 
I THINK ISN'T IT IT'S JUST WONDERFUL 
CUT CUT 
WELL DONE EDWYN 
FIRST PLAY WORLDWIDE OF THE FORTHCOMING NEW SINGLE FROM EDWYN COLLINS YOU'LL NEVER KNOW 
THE RELEASE OF THE NEW SINGLE AND ALBUM LAUNCHES EDWYN BACK INTO HIS OLD WORLD 
HE IS MAKING MUSIC ONCE MORE AND IN JUST TWO MONTHS 
HE PLANS TO PERFORM IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS 
BUT JUST BEFORE HE ATTEMPTS THIS HUGE STEP ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY 
EDWYN TRAVELS TO HELMSDALE TO PREPARE FOR THE CHALLENGE 
BOTH HE AND GRACE HAVE NOTICED OTHER SIGNS THAT HE'S GETTING BETTER 
O. K. MR. INDEPENDENT 
DO YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU OR ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT YOURSELF NO I'M FINE 
I'M STUBBORN 
I KNOW WHAT'S WRONG ESPECIALLY WITH MY ALBUM COMING OUT 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT AND YOU WON'T BE TOLD 
YEP THAT'S THE OLD YOU FOR SURE 
YOU'RE BACK TO BEING STUBBORN WHICH YOU WEREN'T 
SO THE GREAT NEWS IS HE'S BACK TO BEING CUSSED AWKWARD STUBBORN 
STEADY ON PLEASE 
GOOD GOD 
SO THIS IS CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION 
OH IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
THE FIRST TIME YOUR DAD BROUGHT ME HERE WILL I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT 
TWO SEALS FOLLOWED US ALL THE WAY MILES ALONG THE BEACH DIDN'T THEY 
YEP I THOUGHT I'M GOING TO HOLD THIS LITTLE MOMENT 
FOR EVER 
I THINK I DO HAVE TO STOP MYSELF LOOKING BACK THINKING 
OH IF ONLY THERE'S NO GOING BACK 
I JUST BANISH THAT STUFF BECAUSE WE NEED TO 
CRACK ON YEAH 
ARE YOU THE SAME PERSON THAT YOU WERE BEFORE YOU HAD YOUR STROKE 
NOT REALLY 
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TOUCH THE ESSENCE OF WHO I AM ONCE MORE 
BUT I'M NOT DEPRESSED AT ALL 
TWO YEARS ON 
I'M GETTING THERE SLOWLY 
WHAT HAVE WE LOST 
WE HAVE LOST EVERYTHING 
WE'VE BROKEN ALL OUR TOYS 
WE WERE NAUGHTY LITTLE BOYS 
THAT'S ONE OF YOUR FINEST COMPOSITIONS 
BACK IN LONDON IT'S THE DAY OF EDWYN'S FIRST LIVE SHOW SINCE HE FELL ILL 
THE SELL OUT GIG AT DINGWALLS IN CAMDEN IS ONLY HOURS AWAY 
ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT IT YES 
GENUINELY NERVOUS AND TREPIDATIOUS AND ER IT'S GOOD TO BE NERVOUS 
I TOO AM TREPIDATIOUS BUT I'M TELLING MYSELF ALL THE TIME THAT EDWYN AND I HAVE TO REMEMBER 
TO ENJOY THIS BECAUSE IT'S A DAY WE DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT TO SEE 
AND IT IS REALLY FANTASTIC 
THE SOUNDCHECK ALLOWS FOR SOME LAST MINUTE REHEARSALS 
EDWYN'S USUAL DRUMMER PAUL COOK IS INVOLVED IN THE SEX PISTOLS' REUNION 
SO DAVE RUFFY TAKES HIS PLACE 
EDWYN'S FRIEND RODDY FRAME A FELLOW PIONEER FROM THE POSTCARD DAYS WILL PLAY GUITAR 
KEEP ON KNOCKING KNOCKING ON MY DOOR 
WHEN HE GOES ON I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY EXCITING MOMENT FOR ME TO WATCH HIM 
NOW YOU COME ALONG 
I KNOW HE'S A BIT SCARED BUT I KNOW HE'S GOING TO DO WELL BECAUSE HE THRIVES UNDER THIS KIND OF PRESSURE 
I'VE A HORRIBLE FEELING THAT I'M GOING TO BE TERRIFIED 
I WAS TRYING TO WORK OUT WHY I HAVE BEEN SO ANXIOUS ABOUT THIS 
AND I THINK SINCE HIS ILLNESS I'VE FELT AS IF I'VE STOOD BETWEEN HIS VULNERABILITY AND THE WORLD 
AND I'VE GOT TO GET RIGHT OUT OF THE WAY AND LET HIM GET ON WITH IT 
HE'S ON HIS OWN AND REALLY IT'S DOWN TO HIM 
IT'S A STEP I'M REALLY GLAD TO MAKE BUT IT'S QUITE TOUGH TO MAKE IT JUST THE SAME 
WE'RE PROBABLY MORE REHEARSED THAN USUAL 
USUALLY IT'S A BIT MORE SHAMBOLIC THAN THIS 
A COUPLE OF RUN THROUGHS AND THEN WE'D HAVE GONE DOWN THE PUB REALLY WE WOULD HAVE DONE IN THE OLD DAYS 
UP UP UP UP UP UP UP UP UP 
HE'S A VERY TENACIOUS CHARACTER HE'S VERY STRONG 
AND HE'S A PERFORMER AT THE END OF THE DAY 
AND THIS IS WHAT HE LIVES FOR 
THERE WAS A REALLY BIG PART OF ME 
THAT THOUGHT THIS IS THE END OF HIS CAREER 
BUT IT'S REALLY GOOD TO SEE THAT IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN 
THAT I'M GOING TO GET TO SEE HIM DO IT AGAIN 
I REALLY THINK THAT HE'S GOING TO DO AMAZING TONIGHT 
HE'S GOING TO DO GREAT I KNOW HE IS 
HOW WILL YOU MEASURE IF THE GIG'S BEEN A SUCCESS 
I SUPPOSE UM 
POSSIBLY THE CROWD 
THE CROWD WILL ROAR 
AFTER HUNDREDS OF GIGS HE DID NOTHING LIKE THIS EVER 
I'VE JUST GOT TO REMEMBER TO REALLY ENJOY IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIFE AND DEATH 
IT'S JUST A REALLY GOOD THING 
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY 
IF EVER YOU'RE READY 
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY 
IF EVER YOU'RE READY 
JUST THREE YEARS AFTER SUFFERING TWO BRAIN HAEMORRHAGES THAT NEARLY KILLED HIM 
AND LEFT HIM UNABLE TO WALK AND TALK EDWYN COLLINS IS TAKING TO THE STAGE ONCE MORE 
GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY 
I'M INCREDIBLY HONOURED TO BE HERE WITH THESE GREAT MUSICIANS 
BUT I'M REALLY HONOURED TO INTRODUCE THE ESTEEMED EDWYN COLLINS 
IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES 
IN HER SMILE HE SAW THE PARTS THAT SHE PLAYED IN 
HE WASN'T LISTENING TO THE SWEET WORDS 
HE WASN'T LISTENING TO THE LYING TONGUE 
HE WAS LISTENING TO THE WORDS BEING SUNG 
OH BLUE BOY 
FOR EDWYN IT'S A BIG DEAL TO GET HIM BACK ON A STAGE 
WE'VE SEEN REMARKABLE ADVANCES ALREADY 
BUT YOU WAIT UNTIL HE GETS TO DO THEM IN FRONT OF PEOPLE 
THEN YOU'LL REALLY SEE HIM GO 
WHOA WHOA WHOA 
HE WASN'T LISTENING TO THE SWEET WORDS 
HE WASN'T LISTENING TO THE LYING TONGUE 
HE WAS LISTENING TO THE WORDS BEING SUNG 
BLUE BOY 
WHOA 
FOR EDWYN TO DO A GIG WITHOUT A DIALOGUE WITH HIS BAND AND THE AUDIENCE WOULD BE WEIRD 
HE IS A TALKER 
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ON STAGE TALKER 
SOME PEOPLE USED TO COME TO SEE HIM FOR HIS PATTER AS MUCH AS FOR THE SONGS 
AND YOU NEVER REALLY KNEW WHERE IT WOULD GO YOU KNOW 
SO IT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE THAT THAT WAS STILL THERE TOO 
BE QUIET 
I'M ENJOYING THIS ER GIG 
THIS IS GOOD FUN YES 
THE ATMOSPHERE IN HERE IS ELECTRIC 
THIS IS GREAT YES 
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NO PROBLEM AT ALL 
I NEVER MET A GIRL LIKE YOU BEFORE 
NOW JUST LIKE IN A SONG FROM DAYS OF YORE 
SHE COMES KNOCKIN' KNOCKIN' ON MY DOOR 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC A LOSS FOR WORDS 
I AM ABSOLUTELY THRILLED THAT HE IS GETTING TO SEE THAT HE'S BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS 
BUT HAND ON HEART I WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD DO IT 
IT'S DOWN TO SHEER MOTIVATION AND REAL HARD WORK 
I REMEMBER I USED TO BE IN THE CAR DRIVING HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL 
AND I'D SOMETIMES HAVE THIS STUPID SORT OF DAYDREAM THING ABOUT 
IMAGING MAYBE ONE DAY THAT EDWYN WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER 
THAT WE'D WORK REALLY REALLY HARD AND ONE DAY MAYBE HE'LL PLAY A SHOW 
AND THEN THINK DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS FOR 
WELL HERE WE ARE 
YOU'VE MADE ME ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEVIL IN ME 
I HOPE TO GOD I'M TALKING METAPHORICALLY 
HOPE I'M TALKING ALLEGORICALLY 
KNOW THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WAY I FEEL 
SYMPATHY WASN'T THE THING TONIGHT 
IT WAS A REALLY GOOD SHOW AND A BLOKE THAT HAD OVERCOME ALL OF THE ODDS 
AND HE'S THERE PUTTING ON A FANTASTIC SHOW 
NEVER NEVER NEVER 
HE JUST A FORCE OF NATURE HE REALLY IS 
HE'S SOMETHING ELSE 
OUT OF ALL OF MY DAD'S GIGS THIS HAS BEEN MY BEST ONE 
BECAUSE OF THE STROKE AND COS IT'S HIS FIRST GIG AFTER AGES AND AGES IT'S JUST THE BEST ONE SO FAR 
I FEEL REALLY PROUD AND HAPPY AND SATISFIED 
HE IS SO ECSTATIC SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE TELLING HIM HOW GREAT HE IS 
EDWYN LOVES THAT AS HE SAYS 
MY EGO IS INTACT 
IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK AGAIN 
WHAT AN EXPERIENCE 
I'M BACK AND I'M LOVING IT 
I LOVE YOU TOO 
I'M HOME AGAIN 
HARDLY CERTAIN OF MY ROLE AND THEN 
I KEEP SEARCHING FOR MY SOUL AGAIN 
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD FIND 
I'M HOME AGAIN 
BUT I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE 
OLD FRIENDS 
AND I KNOW I'LL KEEP CONSOLED AGAIN 
IN THE PAST I'VE LEFT BEHIND 
WHEN I WAS A BOY 
WELL I HEARD SOMEBODY SINGING 
AND I HEARD THE GUITARS RINGING 
AND IT BROUGHT ME HOME AGAIN 
WHAT DO YOU MISS OF YOUR OLD LIFE 
UM 
NOTHING AT ALL 
HOME AGAIN 
HOME AGAIN
