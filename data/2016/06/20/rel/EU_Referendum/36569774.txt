 Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has made a defence of immigration ahead of the EU referendum, saying austerity is the issue that voters should be focused on.  Speaking to the Andrew Marr programme, Mr Corbyn said: "If we leave as a country, exactly the same arguments are going to be made about housing, about jobs, about social security... but it will be a lot more difficult."
