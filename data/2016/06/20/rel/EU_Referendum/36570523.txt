 Boris Johnson has urged supporters at a rally to "take back control" by voting for the UK to leave the EU in the forthcoming referendum. He also renewed calls for an amnesty for immigrants who have been in the UK for more than 12 years. Mr Johnson said: "We cannot vote for the status quo... the EU morphing relentlessly into a superstate".
