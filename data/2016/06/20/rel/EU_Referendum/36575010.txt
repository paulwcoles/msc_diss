 Baroness Warsi says she switched sides in the EU referendum campaign from Leave to Remain because the campaign had become dominated by "lies" and "xenophobia". She said she realised she could no longer support Leave when she saw UKIP's "breaking point" anti-EU poster. Vote Leave said it was not aware Lady Warsi had joined its campaign, while Nigel Farage defended the poster, saying it was "the truth".
