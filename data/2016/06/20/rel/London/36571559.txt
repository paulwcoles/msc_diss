 London's skyline was dominated by hot air balloons as they ascended in aid of the Lord Mayor's Appeal.  The event had been postponed for two weeks because of the weather. Lord Mayor Jeffrey Mountevans said: "The [regatta] raises funds and awareness for the Lord Mayor's Appeal charities - this year supporting young people to overcome challenges and to excel.  "And what better inspiration to reach for the heights, than the Lord Mayor's Balloon Regatta: a glorious celebration of London's glittering skyline."
