 A man has been rescued from the River Tay by a lifeboat crew after his sea scooter developed technical issues. Broughty Ferry RNLI attended the incident off Dundee Port on Sunday after the man contacted his family to tell them he was experiencing mechanical problems. The lifeboat reached the powerless vehicle, which had drifted between the Tay bridges, shortly after 14:00. The man did not require medical attention. The lifeboat towed the scooter to Broughty Ferry harbour where the man was transferred to shore and met by the coastguard.
