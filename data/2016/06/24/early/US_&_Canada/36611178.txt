 The Supreme Court has announced it is split on President Barack Obama's plan to shield millions of undocumented immigrants living illegally in the US. The deadlock between the eight judges occurred because of the death of the ninth, Justice Antonin Scalia, which left a vacancy that is still unfilled despite the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. Reacting to the decision, Mr Obama said Republicans in Congress were "wilfully preventing the Supreme Court from being fully-staffed".
