 A tornado and hailstorm have killed at least 98 people and injured nearly 800 in the east Chinese province of Jiangsu, according to state media. Accompanied by torrential rain, the tornado struck the outskirts of the city of Yancheng on Thursday afternoon. Counties on the city's outskirts saw winds of up to 125km/h (78 mph).  Heavy rains and the possibility of more hailstorms and tornadoes have further complicated rescue efforts, the CCTV network reported.  On Friday, rescuers were carrying injured villagers into ambulances and delivering food and water to others, said state news agency Xinhua. Tents and other emergency supplies were being sent from Beijing.  Footage from the scene of the tornado showed overturned vehicles, snapped trees and street light poles, and toppled electricity pylons. "It was like the end of the world," local resident Xie Litian told Xinhua. "I heard the gales and ran upstairs to shut the windows. I had hardly reached the top of the stairs when I heard a boom and saw the entire wall with the windows on it torn away." President Xi Jinping has ordered "all-out rescue efforts" to help those affected by the storms. Many parts of China have been hit by torrential rains this week. Floods in the south killed 22 people earlier this week and displaced nearly 200,000, state media said. The southern part of China is hit every year during the monsoon season, which runs from May to July.  But this year's rainy season has been particularly wet, with water levels in some major rivers exceeding those of 1998, when disastrous floods affected 180 million people, according to state media. Direct economic losses from the floods are estimated to be 2.7bn yuan ($410m). Vice-Premier Wang Yang said China faced volatile weather conditions as a result of the influence of El Nino on weather patterns.
