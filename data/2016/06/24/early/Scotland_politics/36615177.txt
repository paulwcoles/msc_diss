 Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was clear that people in Scotland saw their future as part of the European Union. She made her view known in a statement issued after all 32 local authority areas north of the border voted for Remain in the EU referendum. Results from the UK are still coming in, but it is widely accepted that the Leave vote has won. Ms Sturgeon said Scotland "has spoken - and spoken decisively". A BBC forecast is suggesting that the UK has voted by 52% to 48% to leave the European Union after 43 years. Both London and Scotland voted strongly to stay in the EU, but the Remain vote appeared to be undermined by poor results in the north of England. Voters in Wales and the English regions have backed Brexit in large numbers. Ahead of the final outcome, Ms Sturgeon said: "Scotland has delivered a strong, unequivocal vote to remain in the EU, and I welcome that endorsement of our European status. "And while the overall result remains to be declared, the vote here makes clear that the people of Scotland see their future as part of the European Union. "Scotland has contributed significantly to the Remain vote across the UK. That reflects the positive campaign the SNP fought, which highlighted the gains and benefits of our EU membership, and people across Scotland have responded to that positive message. "We await the final UK-wide result, but Scotland has spoken - and spoken decisively."
