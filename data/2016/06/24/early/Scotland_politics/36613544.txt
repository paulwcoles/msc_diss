 The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, insisted her party would be united - whatever the result of the EU referendum. Early declarations have indicated that the result is on a knife edge. Ms Davidson told the BBC's David Dimbleby that her party had much more to "keep it together than divide it". In the early hours of Friday morning it was looking like the turnout in Scotland was below that of the UK as a whole. Ms Davidson said that it was not surprising voter numbers would be down on the Scottish independence referendum which took place 20 months ago. On 18 September 2014, the Scotland-only poll saw an 85% turnout, the EU referendum turnout could be below 70%.  Questioned on the future of the Tory Party, MSP Ms Davidson: "We as a party have much more to keep us together than divide us and this has been a passionate debate. "But remember just a year ago my colleagues in London were elected on a manifesto to have a referendum on the European Union - we have carried out that, that we would respect the result - whatever it is - and after that we would all as democrats respect the will of the people of this country, come back together and govern to the manifesto on which we were elected." Ms Davidson was a key backer of the Remain campaign and was part of a TV panel of pro-Europeans which went head-to-head with Leave campaigners, featuring Conservative MP Boris Johnson. She denied any "personal invective" towards Mr Johnson, saying that any challenges she made of him were linked to his arguments that the UK should end its membership of the EU.
