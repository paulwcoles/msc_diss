 The 176th Royal Highland Show is getting under way at Ingliston on the outskirts of Edinburgh. It has been a tough year for the farming industry between depressed prices for produce and the late payments of subsidies.  About 200,000 people are expected to visit over the next four days. BBC Scotland's Willie Johnston has been there.
