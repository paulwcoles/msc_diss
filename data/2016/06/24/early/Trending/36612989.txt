 It was the first and least surprising result of the EU referendum vote count. Gibraltar has voted overwhelmingly in favour of Britain remaining in the European Union.  Gibraltar, is a British overseas territory at the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula and has around 30,000 residents. It's has also been a British territory since 1713, though Spain continues to claim sovereignty over the territory. But, the majority of Gibraltarians are British citizens with British passports. 84% of Gibraltarians turned up to vote in the EU referendum. 19,322 checked the box to stay in the EU and 823 voted to leave. And it's the 823 that has intrigued Twitter. But there was some internet love for the 823. Some mused that whoever the mysterious 823 were they would undoubtedly have a certain swagger. And there was the odd conspiracy theorist. Maybe this is the start of something.
