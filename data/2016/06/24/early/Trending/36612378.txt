  As millions cast their vote in the EU referendum the discussion on social media couldn't have been more British.  The appalling weather and dogs were key topics of conversation as well as a 'conspiracy theory' about pencils. And then there was Keith's 93-year-old mum. Keith Adams probably couldn't have anticipated the social media storm that was triggered when when tweeted about his trip to the polling station with his Leave supporting mother.  As a result both Keith and 93yr Mum trended in the UK. The hashtag #KeithsMum was also popular. Many people it seemed doubted her existence. The weather did cause genuine disruption at some polling stations. But were people getting carried away? This spoilsport felt so. Some thought this was giving the Illuminati and their local authority minions too much credit. However, as polls closed #IVotedLeave was Britain's top trend on Twitter as Brexit supporters stated why they voted the way they did. This one was, we hope, tongue in cheek.
