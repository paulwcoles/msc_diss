 Many people had a childhood dream about teleportation - you enter a glimmering teleport, or say "Beam me up!" and are transported hundreds, maybe even millions of miles away.  For the initial stage of the programme development, 2016-18, the agency responsible is seeking about 10bn roubles (Â£100m) in financing. There was an online reaction to this bold statement. Russian internet users reacted in all kinds of different ways, from disbelief, to amazement to sarcasm. Spoof account "Yekhidnye Novosti" (Russian for "sneering news") wondered: "Teleportation is all very well. But perhaps it would make sense first to provide half of Russian population with hot running water?" The outdoor toilets proved to be popular among netizens as would-be teleportation devices. Others were sceptical about the proper use of the funds allocated for the project. Prominent opposition leader Alexei Navalny retweeted the Kommersant report accompanying it with a photo of a somewhat bewildered-looking Prime Minister Medvedev making a balloon figure.
