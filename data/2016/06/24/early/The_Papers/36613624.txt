 Friday's front pages are dominated by the EU referendum, though the papers went to press before the results were in. Among the stories making headlines is David Cameron's future as prime minister. The letter is signed by more than 80 Tory MPs - including every Cabinet minister who said they would vote Leave, the paper adds. The Sun says that - regardless of the result - Mr Cameron "cannot ignore for a moment longer the explosion of anger from millions of working-class people at the ballot box". It says pro-Remain MPs "treated Brexit voters like filth on their shoes", and warns that Britain is heading for "catastrophe" if the government fails to focus on working-class people. The issue of division - be it by background, political persuasion or location - is a major talking point in Friday's papers. The Mirror's front page calls for "project reunite", as it pictures a kissing couple wearing EU and UK face paints. But she says the UK can "finally feel united" if it can find a "new politics which speaks to ordinary working people". Much has been made in recent weeks of the tone and quality of the campaigns, and that debate continues. Stephens says democracies operate in a "framework of rationalism" and warns: "Dismantle it and the space is filled by prejudice." And he asks: "How long before Mr Gove... is piling books on to bonfires" - an image depicted in a cartoon in the paper. There is some discussion about the merits of calling referendums.
