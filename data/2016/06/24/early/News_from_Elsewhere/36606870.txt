 Uzbekistan's capital has reportedly issued a temporary ban on Soviet-era cars entering the city ahead of a major international summit. Banning the old cars is an unusual decision given that they're Russian-made, and Russia is a major participant in the SCO summit. But the website's report, signed by editor Sergey Yeshkov, describes the move as "window dressing" for foreigners who are visiting Uzbekistan for the first time. It suggests that the mayor's office wants summit guests to see only Uzbek-made cars or prestigious foreign vehicles on the roads.
