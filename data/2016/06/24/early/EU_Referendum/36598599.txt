 Voters across north-east England have given the thumbs down to European Union membership. With one result still to be declared, people in 10 areas voted to leave. Newcastle was the only one supporting Remain, and that was by the narrow margin of 1%. Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, voted leave, in most cases by a large margin. Northumberland's result is still to be declared. Following the early Sunderland result, the value of Sterling dropped by about 3% on the markets.

Both areas are traditionally Labour, and shadow home secretary Andy Burnham told local supporters who had voted to leave that "we hear you". He said: "We understand what you are saying. This referendum can't mark the end of the process." As the extent of the Leave vote emerged across the region, former business secretary and Remain campaigner Sir Vince Cable said: "I think people in the highly-deprived areas of the North East are expressing their frustration in this way."

It is also performing particularly strongly on Teesside, with in Hartlepool seven out of 10 people voting for Brexit. Labour is saying austerity is to blame, but Vote Leave says people didn't buy the scaremongering stories about job losses.
