 Leave voters are overwhelmingly in the lead in the South East as local authorities continue to declare their results in the EU referendum. Ashford, Canterbury, Dartford, Dover, Maidstone, Medway, Tonbridge and Malling, Sevenoaks, Swale, Shepway and Thanet all voted to leave the EU. Gravesham delivered the biggest Leave majority in Kent of 30.8%, with 35,643 votes to 18,876 for Remain. Tunbridge Wells is the only Kent town to vote for Remain. Conservative MP for South Thanet, Craig Mackinlay, said he had never been part of a more interesting day in British politics. "There is an enthusiasm here for Britain to be a normal independent country," he said. In Sussex Adur, Arun, Crawley, Chichester Eastbourne, Hastings, Rother and Worthing, were also in favour of leave. But Lewes, Horsham and Mid Sussex bucked the trend with votes to remain. Brighton and Hove delivered the biggest vote in favour of remain with a 37.2% majority of 100,648 votes to 46,027. In Surrey, Runnymede, Surrey Heath, Reigate and Banstead, Slough, Spelthorne and Tandridge have all voted to leave the EU. Elmbridge, Epsom and Ewell, Mole Valley, Waverley and Woking voted to remain. UKIP Leader and South East MEP Nigel Farage has hailed a victory for Leave in the referendum, declaring "let June 23 go down in our history as our independence day". But Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: "This is an absolutely devastating result. I feel heartbroken." Green Party South East MEP Keith Taylor said: "After a bitter and unedifying campaign, the most important task now is unifying our divided communities." She was previously one of only nine MPs who had not declared which way they would vote in the referendum. Fellow Conservative Tracey Crouch has still not declared how she voted after saying she was keeping it private to avoid conflict in her Kent constituency of Chatham and Aylesford.
