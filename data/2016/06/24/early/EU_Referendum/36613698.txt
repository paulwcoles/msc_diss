 The east of England has overwhelmingly voted in favour of Britain leaving the EU. Basildon, which declared its result early on, set the trend for the region, with 68.6% backing a Brexit. Of the 41 of 47 results declared so far, 1,567,801 have voted leave and 1,218,644 remain. Norwich, Cambridge, St Albans and North Hertfordshire are the only areas in the East so far to have voted in favour of remaining. The closest result in the region so far has been Uttlesford where 25,619 voted to remain and 26,324 voted to leave. South Norfolk, Great Yarmouth, Peterborough, Southend, Epping Forest, Forest Heath, Chelmsford, Colchester, Welwyn Hatfield and Rochford have also voted in favour of leaving. We have long known that the east of England is one of the most Eurosceptic parts of Great Britain. In the past few hours, that fact has shown itself to be overwhelmingly true. Across Essex and right up the east coast, people voted for Brexit. The same is also true further west, with a few notable exceptions such Norwich and Cambridge. As the sun rises over Lowestoft this region - just like the rest of Britain - is changed forever.
