 London boroughs have mainly voted to remain in the EU - bucking the national trend. Barking and Dagenham, Bexley and Sutton have gone against the capital's trend by voting to leave, but in some boroughs more than 70% voted to remain. It was predicted results in the capital might help swing the final result in favour of remaining in the EU. BBC Radio London Political Reporter Susana Mendonca said the mood of Remain campaigners at London's Guildhall was lifted when the first London boroughs announced their results. But as the national picture emerged, it was members of the Leave camp who were more "chipper", she said. The change in mood was reflected elsewhere in the capital. Earlier, at the Barking and Dagenham count, where 62% voted to leave, UKIP's Peter Harris said he was "massively more confident" than at the beginning of the evening. "We've smashed it," he said. But council leader, Darren Rodwell, who supported remain, said the borough was experiencing a massive change in demographics and population flow and in five years time he said the same question would produce a very different result. The voter turnout in London was 69.8%, despite the torrential rain and flooding in parts of the city. City of London, the first borough to return a result, voted to remain with 3,312 as opposed to 1,087 for leave. Among other areas that voted to remain were Lambeth with 111,584 votes (79%) compared with 30,340 in favour of leave. In Wandsworth 75% (118,463) voted to remain. Hammersmith and Fulham also voted to remain along with Islington, Richmond-upon-Thames, Merton and Westminster. In Islington 76,420 votes were in favour as opposed to 25,180 wanting to leave. In Hammersmith and Fulham 56,188 votes were cast for remain while just 24,054 wanted to leave. With 82% turnout, 69% of voters in Richmond chose to remain with the union while 31% were against the move. In Westminster 53,928 voted to remain, while less than half that number wanted to leave. More than 63,000 Merton voters were in favour while 37,097 wanted to exit. Haringey (76%), Ealing (90,024 votes) and Waltham Forest also went with the capital's trend for a mandate for the Remain campaign with 64,156 votes. Hounslow (58,755 votes), Hackney (83,398), Kensington and Chelsea (37,601), Tower Hamlets (73,011), Croydon (92,913), Enfield (56%), Camden (75%), Newham (53%) and Harrow (55%) have also voted for Remain. In Bexley 63% backed Brexit, while in Sutton leave won with 54%. The turnout in London is 69.8% turnout - the highest since the 1950 general election when more than 80% voted. Earlier Laura Kuenssberg, BBC's political editor, said experts predicted nearly 1.9 million people in inner London areas were likely to vote Remain while Leave campaigners expected favourable results in outer London. "London is an island", compared to the rest of the country where the Leave campaign is gaining ground, she added.
