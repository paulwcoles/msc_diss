 Donald Trump shouts "Get him out", as a protestor disrupts the official opening of the Trump Turnberry golf resort. The US presidential nominee was just about to speak when he noticed comedian Simon Brodkin, also known as Lee Nelson, attempting to hand out golf balls with a swastika on them and told his security to remove him. Once removed from sight, the speeches from the Trump family continued.
