 An electric racing car built by Swiss student engineers has broken the world record for acceleration by battery-powered vehicles. The grimsel car took only 1.513 seconds to reach 100 kmph (62 mph) - slashing about a quarter of a second off the previous record time. So far, no petrol-powered production car has managed to hit the same speed in a comparable time.
