 The world's largest uncut diamond has failed to sell at an auction in London after bids fell short of the reserve price. The Lesedi la Rona is believed to be 2.5 billion years old and was found in Botswana in November. The 1,109-carat rough diamond had been expected to sell for more than £52m ($70m) but the highest bid was about £45m ($61m).
