 A man has been shot in the legs in a paramilitary-style attack in Carrickfergus, County Antrim. It happened at Dunluskin Gardens in the town at about 17:30 BST on Wednesday. The victim is in a stable condition in hospital. Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said there could be no excuses for such attacks. "Those behind this attack must face the full force of the law. Local people have had enough and do not want to see it," he said.   Police have appealed for witnesses to contact them.
