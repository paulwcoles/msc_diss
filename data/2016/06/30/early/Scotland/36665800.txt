 The SNP have questioned whether Labour should continue to be recognised as the official opposition party in Westminster. Pete Wishart raised a point of order to highlight that the shadow cabinet cannot provide ministers for several large departments and could therefore not assume power should the current Conservative government resign. Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, responded by saying that he had sought expert advice on the matter and that Labour remain the official opposition.
