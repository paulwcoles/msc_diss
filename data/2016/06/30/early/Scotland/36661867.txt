 The Scottish government's meetings to maintain Scotland's relationship with the EU have begun. Nicola Sturgeon met EU Parliament president Martin Schulz on Wednesday morning. Speaking afterwards the first minister said she was aware of that the matter will take some time to resolve. She said: "I don't underestimate the challenges that lie ahead for us in seeking to find a path and this is very much an initial series of meetings in Brussels." Mr Schulz said simply: "I listened carefully and I learned a lot."
