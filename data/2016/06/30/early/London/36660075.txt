 Protesters staging a pro-EU demonstration marched from London's Trafalgar Square to outside the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday evening. The crowd could be heard shouting "love not hate" and "no more lies".   Support was shown from Alistair Campbell and MPs Paula Sherriff, Anna Soubry and Wayne David.
