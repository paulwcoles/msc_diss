 A burglar has been found guilty of raiding the home of pop star Rita Ora while she and her sister slept upstairs. Charaf El Moudden, 26, took £200,000 worth of property from the former X Factor judge's house during the burglary on 28 November last year. Her sister Elena was awoken by a man rifling through items in her bedroom, prompting Ora to call police. Ten out of 12 jurors found El Moudden guilty at Harrow Crown Court. Jewellery, bags and iPhones were among the items taken when two men broke into the star's home in a targeted attack. During the call she told the operator: "Oh my God I don't have a knife, I know they're going to come upstairs." Giving evidence from behind a curtain, the singer said she was woken by her sister's screams. "She just ran up the stairs then she jumped on my bed and started screaming," she said. The court heard Rita Ora's four-bedroom property in north-west London had been deliberately chosen by  El Moudden because he knew she lived there. He has a number of previous convictions including trying to sell pictures of the body of a dead Harry Potter actor.  Wearing a pink long-sleeved polo shirt, he put his head in his hands as the verdict was read out.  Despite denying involvement in the burglary, police discovered £3,500 in cash "hidden" in an envelope in a sofa bed at El Moudden's home in north London, at the time of his arrest in January.  In December 2006 he pleaded guilty to forcing entry to a Costcutter shop and stealing property from inside the store. Five years later he admitted breaking into a house in north-west London and stealing goods including jewellery, watches, foreign currency and a BMW with a total value of around £75,000. El Moudden was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at a later date.
