 A decisive hearing in the Scottish Parliament's bid to evict Holyrood independence campaigners is to enter its second day. Lord Turnbull is hearing arguments about whether removing the IndyCamp group from the parliamentary estate would breach their human rights. The parliament has put forward a case claiming the camp should not be "permanent or indeterminate" in scope. Representatives of some of the campers will put forward their case next. The camp was set up in November 2015, with the aim of staying in place until Scotland is declared independent. However, the parliament's corporate body took the group to court seeking eviction, saying they were taking up land that could be used by others and endangering the political neutrality of the parliamentary estate. In court, parliament's lawyer Gerry Moynihan QC has argued that the group have every right to protest, but not to occupy land belonging to a third party permanently or for an indeterminate period. Meanwhile, one camp respondent, Richard McFarlane, put forward an affidavit signed "Christ, King of Scotland" which denounced the court as illegitimate and called for the judges and the Queen to be executed. Another camper, Garry Mitchell, argued that evicting the IndyCamp would be "an affront to democracy, to the rule of law and to this court".
