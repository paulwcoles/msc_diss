 The family of a man found murdered on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion said they are devastated that charges against two of the three suspects have been dropped.  When the body of former Sittingbourne teacher Carl Davies was discovered in November 2011, it was initially declared a tragic accident. A murder investigation was launched a week later, but his family have now said they have lost faith in the ability of the authorities on the island to secure justice.
