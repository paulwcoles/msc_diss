 Human disturbances are making the Amazon rainforest more flammable, according to researchers.  While the Brazilian Amazon is protected from large-scale deforestation, this new study - published in the journal Nature - suggests that more effort is needed to "safeguard the hyper-diversity of tropical forest ecosystems".  Professor Jos Barlow, who explains the findings here, shared his team's findings, and exclusive footage they captured of Amazon wildfires, with BBC News.  Footage courtesy of A. Ronan, A.
