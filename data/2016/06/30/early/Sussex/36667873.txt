 A man has been given a suspended prison sentence and banned from keeping animals after an 11-week-old kitten died from head and abdomen injuries. Norman Wilson, 48, of Oakenfield, Burgess Hill, West Sussex, had previously admitted animal welfare offences towards Tiny Tim. Wilson was sentenced to 10 weeks in jail, suspended for a year, when he appeared before Brighton magistrates. The RSPCA said Tiny Tim was so badly injured he had to be put to sleep. A pathology and veterinary report showed the kitten had suffered non-accidental injuries described as "blunt force injury". Wilson was also given a 20-day rehabilitation order and told to pay £425 costs. The RSPCA said Wilson's wife, Carrone Wilson, 50, pleaded guilty at a hearing earlier this month to an offence under Section 9 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 of failing to protect the kitten from pain, suffering, injury and disease by not exercising reasonable care and supervision, resulting in him receiving non-accidental injuries.  She was given a 12-month conditional discharge and told to pay £200 costs when sentenced, in her absence, on 15 June.
