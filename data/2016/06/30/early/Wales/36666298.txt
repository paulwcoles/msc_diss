 The Welsh Secretary has held the first in a series of meetings with business leaders to reassure them after the UK voted to leave the European Union. "We are determined to address their concerns and make the new settlement work," Alun Cairns said. He set out the UK Government's plans for a specialist EU unit to tackle complexities like trade treaties. Mr Cairns said he was "hugely encouraged" by the optimism businesses showed at the meeting. Meanwhile, James Jones and Luke Payne, two workers at plastic welding company AJ Tensile Fabrications in Caldicot, Monmouthshire, are hopeful things will pan out.
