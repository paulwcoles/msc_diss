 The Welsh Secretary has held the first in a series of meetings with business leaders to reassure them after the UK voted to leave the European Union. "We are determined to address their concerns and make the new settlement work," Alun Cairns said. He set out the UK Government's plans for a specialist EU unit to tackle complexities like trade treaties. Mr Cairns told BBC Wales business correspondent Brian Meechan he was "hugely encouraged" by the optimism business showed at the meeting.
