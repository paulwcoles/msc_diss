 Inadequate policies and procedures as well as staffing issues probably contributed to the death of a dementia patient, an inquest has found. Gwilym Lumley, 88, died after falling and hitting his head at the Heddfan Unit of Wrexham Maelor Hospital in 2014. The inquest jury recorded a conclusion of accidental death. Betsi Cadwaladr health board said it accepted the findings and highlighted that it has since introduced changes to the way communication is handled on the ward. Speaking after the inquest, Mr Lumley's son Richard said it had been "a long 18 months" for the family since his death.
