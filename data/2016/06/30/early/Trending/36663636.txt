 To borrow a phrase that we're probably too old to use, social media "is lit" with mentions of "Heterosexual Pride Day".  The phrase was used more than  300,000 time on Twitter in just a few hours on Wednesday - mostly it has to be said by people ridiculing the idea that such a day might exist or need to exist. Though while there has been much outrage and humour expressed online, it's not entirely clear that anybody has actually arranged any event to celebrate and empower the straight majority community. It could all be a tongue-in-cheek social media invention, perhaps intended to point up the continuing disparities between the way differing sexualities are treated; or to just annoy the easily annoyed. Some asked what other celebratory 'Days' were ahead of us. Some did, however, seem to be taking it seriously.  But who started this viral hashtag? This first tweet for the day appears to come from this account. We approached Sam for comment. The response was immediate and succinct. Although several of the tweets on the tweeter's timeline are colourful, asking for equal rights for straight people as well as a platform to celebrate their union, could this hashtag be an elaborate hoax? An ironic way to poke fun at the collective internet outrage it sparked?
