 A man who burgled his neighbour's house was caught after returning to repair a smashed letterbox, a court heard. Jonathan Heaven, 26, of Portmead, Swansea, broke in through a front door and stole Â£400 cash, televisions and DVD players. But police found his fingerprints on superglue he had used to repair the letterbox following his raid. He was jailed for two years at the city's crown court after admitting burglary. Heaven told police: "I was off my face at the time."
