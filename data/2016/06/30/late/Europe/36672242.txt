 The EU has opened a new chapter in Turkey's EU membership talks, covering budget contributions to the bloc. Turkey's bid to join the EU is highly controversial and featured prominently in the UK's EU referendum campaign. Turkey demanded progress on its bid in return for taking back migrants who want to seek asylum in the EU. But five chapters in Turkey's talks are still blocked because of a dispute between the governments in Ankara and Cyprus. Turkey does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, whose Greek Cypriot leaders demand an end to Turkish control in the island's north. There is widespread concern in the EU about the possibility of a future influx of Turkish workers. As a large, mainly Muslim country Turkey would significantly change the character of the EU. The Leave campaign in the UK referendum warned that the EU was preparing for Turkey to join. The Remain camp however argued that Turkish membership was only a distant prospect and might never happen. Before the March deal Greece was overwhelmed by the challenge of housing migrants and refugees arriving by boat from Turkey.  The onward movement of migrants - many of them fleeing the conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - put severe strains on the EU, as most of them wanted to settle in Germany. But since the deal was struck the numbers crossing the Aegean from Turkey to Greece have dropped dramatically.
