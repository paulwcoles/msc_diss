 Japanese shares have seen their fourth consecutive day of gains, as global stock markets continue to stabilise following the UK's referendum vote.  Stocks had tumbled on Friday in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the EU. The gains came despite fresh data showing May's industrial output falling at the fastest rate in three months.  The slowdown has investors hoping the central bank will step in to take some stimulus action.  "We retain our forecast that the Bank of Japan will announce more easing at next month's meeting," Capital Economics' senior Japan economist Marcel Thieliant said in a note.  Elsewhere in Asia, investors also remained upbeat. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.75% to 20,794.37, while the China's benchmark Shanghai Composite closed flat at 2,929.61.  In Australia, the ASX/200 index closed 1.8% higher at 5,233.38.  South Korea's Kospi index ended the day at 1,970.35, up 0.7% from the previous close.
