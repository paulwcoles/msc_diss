 The parents of a four-year-old boy who died in 2012 following heart surgery at Bristol Royal Children's Hospital have said nobody at the hospital listened to their concerns that he was ill. Yolanda and Steve Turner, from Warminster in Wiltshire, said their son Sean was "happy" and "into mischief" and described him as "the perfect son". "He was so ill he should never have been considered a bed blocker," Mr Turner said. A review has found children receiving cardiac treatment at the hospital were repeatedly given poor care and parents were let down.
