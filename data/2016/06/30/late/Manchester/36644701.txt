 Plans to build the tallest skyscraper in Manchester have been approved by the city council. The apartment block, alongside three smaller ones, will be built in Owen Street, near Deansgate railway station, on land previously used as a car park. More than 100 nearby residents objected to the council about the building plan. They said the buildings would look out of place and do not provide affordable housing. But Manchester City Council said it would be "a striking landmark development" that would regenerate the area. The scheme by developer Renaker Build includes 1,500 apartments, basement car parking and a cinema. The four main towers will range between 37 and 66 storeys, with a further three-storey building housing a tennis court, swimming pool and retail units.
