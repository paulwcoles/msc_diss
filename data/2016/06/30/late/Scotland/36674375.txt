 The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked with a vigil in Edinburgh Castle as part of a series of nationwide events. A two-minute-silence will be held in memory of the fallen on Friday. There were almost 60,000 British casualties on the first day alone, many of them Scottish. BBC Scotland's Cameron Buttle is near the French town of Thiepval where the offensive began.
