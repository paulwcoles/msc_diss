 A prototype for a new fleet of cross country sleeper carriages has been unveiled.   Operator Serco has said the 75 new coaches will transform the journey for overnight travellers between Scotland and London. The current rolling stock is 40 years old.  Peter Strachan, managing director of Serco Caledonian Sleeper, told BBC Scotland the new trains will be in service in 2018.
