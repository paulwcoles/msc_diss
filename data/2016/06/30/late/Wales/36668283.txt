 Aberystwyth University's chancellor has appealed to those who called for its Welsh-speaking halls of residence to be reopened to help fund the project. The university's council endorsed plans to reopen Pantycelyn on Wednesday and said it also intends to renovate the accommodation. But the council did say the necessary funding would have to be secured so it could give a definitive commitment. Sir Emyr Jones Parry, who is also the university council's chairman, said that in the light of Brexit and the university's financial situation, the money would have to be found by holding an appeal.
