 Vienna council has approved a law to prevent carriage horses from working in high temperatures. If 2015 is anything to go by, it could be a relatively relaxing summer. OE24 says the temperature rose above 35C in Vienna 18 times last year.  Councillor for animal protection Ulli Sima has welcomed the changes, which come into effect in mid-July. "Especially in light of the unusually hot days and climate change, we have to be more considerate towards horses pulling carriages," she says in a joint statement with environment councillor Ruediger Maresch.  But not everyone agrees. Councillor Elisabeth Olischar of the conservative People's Party accuses the Social Democrat/Green ruling group of "yet another attack" on Fiaker drivers.
