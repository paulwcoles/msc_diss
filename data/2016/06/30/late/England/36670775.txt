 Gatwick Airport has called for a swift decision on airport expansion in south-east England after it published its annual results. The airport is competing with Heathrow to expand, with a decision due to be made by the government later this year. Gatwick's pre-tax profits jumped 77% to £141m in the year to March. Stewart Wingate, Gatwick's chief executive, said turnover was up 5.5% to £673.1m after the busiest year in the airport's history. He said the results demonstrated the support and momentum behind Gatwick as the site for expansion. "It has become ever more clear that only Gatwick can deliver a new runway for Britain and the growth the economy needs," Mr Wingate said. Gatwick said 2.1m more passengers had passed through its terminals in the past 12 months - bringing the total to 40.8m, with many taking advantage of its 50 long-haul routes. Mr Wingate said: "Aviation is changing fast and Gatwick has now entered the premier league of airports. "In uncertain times and after decades of delay, only Gatwick can now give Britain certainty that airport expansion can finally happen. "Gatwick can have a spade in the ground by 2020 and the first planes flying from a new runway in 2025." But Heathrow bosses disagreed, saying extending its runway capacity was key. "If Britain wants to be confident, outward-looking and at the centre of the world's economy, then expanding Heathrow must be a key building block in the government's Brexit plan," a spokesman said. "It will allow British exporters to trade with all the growing markets of the world.  And, at a time of uncertainty, a £16bn privately-funded infrastructure investment will create jobs and growth across the UK." On Thursday, Mr Johnson said he would not run for the leadership of the party. Heathrow said more than 170 of Britain's business leaders had written to the Transport Secretary on the anniversary to urge the government to inject growth into the economy by progressing with the Heathrow expansion option.
