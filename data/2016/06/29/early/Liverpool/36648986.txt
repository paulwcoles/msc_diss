 An investigation is taking place into a suspected arson attack which "severely damaged" a disused manor house in Cheshire. The blaze started on Saturday at the Grade II-listed Daresbury Hall, at Daresbury, near Warrington.  Cheshire Police said the fire, which destroyed the roof of the three-storey building, is believed to have been started deliberately. Historic England is to visit the site on Tuesday to assess the damage to the property which has been on its Heritage at Risk register for a number of years. Aerial footage shot by Chris Digata shows the extent of the damage.
