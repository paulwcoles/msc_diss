 A suicide bomb and gun attack on Istanbul's Ataturk international airport has left dozens of people dead or injured. Three attackers opened fire near an entry point to the terminal and blew themselves up after police fired at them, officials say. Jared Malsin, the Middle East Correspondent for Time magazine, arrived at the airport just after the attack.
