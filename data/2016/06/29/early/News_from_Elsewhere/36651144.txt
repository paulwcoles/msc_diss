 Belarusians are preparing for a major change in the way they handle money, with coins being brought back into circulation as part of a currency redenomination. For years coins have been issued purely as collectors' items in Belarus, as rampant inflation has made small change redundant - the exchange rate currently stands at 20,000 roubles to the dollar. But from 1 July, existing banknotes will be replaced by a new mixture of coins and notes, all with much smaller denominations.  A Belarus-based economist tells Radio Free Europe that the change will do little to stop inflation, and is merely symbolic. But in the capital, Minsk, one resident sees a positive, saying: "I am satisfied that at last we will have normal wallets - not wallets where, when you open them, you see millions in there."
