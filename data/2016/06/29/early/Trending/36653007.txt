 There was a nasty surprise awaiting passengers in the arrivals hall at Rio De Janeiro's Galeao International Airport on Monday. Along with the relatives carrying flowers and taxi drivers waiting with name boards there were lines of off-duty police with banners that had a far more ominous message: "Welcome to Hell". The police protests are one more symptom of the political and economic woes which have engulfed Brazil and which threaten to overshadow the Olympic Games which Rio is preparing to host in August.  Brazil's Senate suspended the country's President Dilma Rousseff, and then began impeachment proceedings against her over accusations that she manipulated the government budget ahead of her 2014 re-election campaign. On the economic front the picture isn't much prettier. By the first quarter of 2016, government figures showed that Brazil was experiencing its worst recession in 25 years. The Gross Domestic Product of the country shrank 5.4% in comparison with the same period last year. Meanwhile unemployment between February and April of this year grew to 11.2% from 9.5%. Average monthly wages also fell to just 1,962 Brazilian reais ($552).
