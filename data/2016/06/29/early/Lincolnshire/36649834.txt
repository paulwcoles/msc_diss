 An 8ft (2.4m) long snake got itself into trouble after curling up inside a gas fire and getting trapped. Billy the boa constrictor was roaming around its owner's living room in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, when it found its way into the heater. Firefighters had to be called to rescue the pet, who was agitated but not hurt. Billy's owner, Jane Boor, said "[Billy is] pure muscle - very, very strong and I was frantically holding on to him because I didn't know the chimney was blocked up.  "I had terrible visions of him disappearing up the chimney." Andrew Thorpe, of Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue, said around 5ft (1.5m) of the snake was curled inside the gas fire, which was not turned on at the time. He said: "The owner lets Billy roam around the living room to stretch its legs, as it were!  "He usually curls around the pouffe, but the owner turned her back for a minute and it got in a tiny hole under the fire."
