 Official notification of the UK's intention to leave the EU should be sent to Brussels as soon as possible, First Minister Carwyn Jones has said. The move - known as Article 50 - is important as it starts a strict two-year timetable for withdrawal. David Cameron, who announced his resignation after the referendum, has said his successor should trigger the formal process to leave the union. On Tuesday, Mr Jones told AMs a delayed process was not in Wales' interest. "Waiting months... adds to uncertainty," he said.
