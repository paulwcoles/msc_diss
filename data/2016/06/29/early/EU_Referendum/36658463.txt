 Jean-Claude Juncker has told the BBC that the UK has to face the consequences of leaving the EU. The European Commission President told Ros Atkins: "If you are out, you are out". Mr Juncker also said he didn't understand why Nigel Farage had attended Tuesday's European Parliament debate session, after he campaigned to leave.
