 A man and a dog have been rescued after getting into difficulties on a yacht in the Moray Firth.  The Francis Prowd, which is 6m long, lost steering about 50 miles out to sea on a journey to Wick, shortly before 22:00 on Monday.  Experienced yachtsman Anthony Train, 60, and Sniffy were towed back to safety at Fraserburgh harbour by the town's lifeboat at about 05:20. Mr Train said he was amazed how quickly they were rescued.
