 The chief executive of Aberdeen City Council is to make a statement to the full council after a critical report on the crematorium baby ashes scandal.  The inquiry was commissioned by the Scottish government. Angela Scott will make a statement on Wednesday morning and take questions from councillors. After the report was published, she apologised "unreservedly" on behalf of the council in a statement, but did not answer media questions. Former Lord Advocate Dame Elish Angiolini prepared the 400-page national cremation investigation. BBC Scotland revealed in 2013 that no ashes had been offered to the families of infants cremated in Aberdeen over a five-year period. Baby and adult ashes were mixed together and given back to relatives of the adult, while the parents of infants were told there were no ashes. The crematorium at Hazlehead in Aberdeen was among those investigated after it emerged staff at the Mortonhall crematorium in Edinburgh had been burying baby ashes in secret for decades.
