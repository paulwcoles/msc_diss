 Nigerian visual artist Ndidi Emefiele uses recycled materials to explore the issue of gender inequality. Her ongoing series Rainbow depicts women in glasses made from used CDs that change colour according to the light.  The BBC caught up with her at the Gallery of African Art in London, where her work is currently on display.
