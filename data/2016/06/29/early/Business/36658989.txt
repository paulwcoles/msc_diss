 Stock markets in Asia have started the day with more gains, continuing the positive lead set by the US and Europe.  Across the rest Asia, stock markets continued to see gains after the tumultuous losses and the uncertainty in the wake of the UK referendum on EU membership. Britain's course out of the bloc remains unknown, leaving the future of the EU and its currency an unanswered question. Investors, though, are hoping that central banks will step in with more stimulus should global markets return to the past days' volatility.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.4% to 20,243.67 while the mainland benchmark Shanghai Composite was 0.3% higher at 2,918.53.  In Australia, the ASX/200 was also higher, gaining 0.7% to 5,138.10 points.  Commodity giants Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton were both up well over 1%.  In South Korea, the Kospi was 0.7% up at 1,950.28.
