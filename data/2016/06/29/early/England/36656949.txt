 A criminal who went on the run after shooting his partner with an air rifle has been captured on a remote island. A BBC investigation tracked John Soares to Reunion in the Indian Ocean. The team notified Kent police. Soares was convicted in his absence in 2012 at Maidstone Crown Court of causing grievous bodily harm and sentenced to 12 years in jail. He now faces extradition to the UK.
