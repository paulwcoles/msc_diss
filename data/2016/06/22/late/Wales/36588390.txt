 Journalists have called on the Welsh Assembly to scrutinise the "ludicrous" behaviour of news publishers Trinity Mirror. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said changes at the company risked leaving readers uninformed about political decisions made in Cardiff Bay. The Trinity Mirror-owned Daily Post recently announced a proposal to end the role of its Senedd reporter and cover it from Llandudno Junction, Conwy county, with a journalist also covering traffic and transport. The company said it  "remains committed to covering Welsh politics at a local and national level".  It added: "There is no move away from hard news or politics but we are producing additional content that we know readers are also interested in."  But NUJ Trinity Mirror group chapel chairman Martin Shipton said there was too much emphasis on the "trivial", including a blogger to write about bars and restaurants rather than more serious journalism.
