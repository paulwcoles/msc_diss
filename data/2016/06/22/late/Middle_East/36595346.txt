 "There were executions, there were arrests, there were indescribable abuses - against women, against children, against men, against residents of all different sects and ethnicities," said Mr Eesa. "We chose to create a group that would publish information in order to do something for our city, and for Syria, that would combat these barbaric people who have destroyed so many countries," he added. The group's work evolved from reporting on human rights abuses and the names of people who had been arrested, to reporting in English on the issues that IS did not want publicised including  executions in prisons, Mr Eesa explained.
