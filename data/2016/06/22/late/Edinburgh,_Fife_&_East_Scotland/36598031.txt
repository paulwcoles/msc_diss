 A man who exposed himself to an 11-year-old girl on a path in Fife is being sought by police. The incident happened between 21:00 and 22:00 on Saturday on a path near Park Road in Cowdenbeath.  The girl immediately went home and told her parents who then raised the alarm with police.  The man was in his 30s, about 5ft 9ins tall, of very thin build, bald, clean-shaven and may walk regularly in the area. He was wearing a green jacket, a green top with flowers on it, dark blue skinny jeans, black shoes, possibly trainers and may regularly walk in the area.  Det Con Dale Hendry of Police Scotland, said: "Whilst the man did not attempt to approach her and she was not harmed, this has obviously been very upsetting for her and we are appealing for anyone who recognises the description or who may have been in the area and seen anyone acting suspiciously to contact the police." The girl reported seeing an elderly man walking a black and white dog shortly before the incident.  Police are keen to speak to this man as he may have relevant information.
