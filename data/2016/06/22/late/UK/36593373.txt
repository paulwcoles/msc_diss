 A Scottish woman jailed in Peru three years ago for smuggling drugs has been released from prison and is set to fly back to the UK. Melissa Reid, 22, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, and Michaella McCollum, from Co Tyrone, were caught with 24lb (11kg) of cocaine at Lima airport in 2013. Reid has served about a third of her sentence and according to Peruvian law was eligible to be deported under an early release scheme for foreign prisoners.
