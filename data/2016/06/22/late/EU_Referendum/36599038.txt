 The leader of the House of Commons has sought to reassure people that trade with the EU would continue post-Brexit, as politicians make their final pitches before Thursday's EU referendum. Visiting a farm in Ruthin, Denbighshire, Chris Grayling urged voters not to be afraid to vote to leave the European Union, promising the UK would become a "stronger, prouder, more independent nation". Campaigning in Flintshire for the Remain side, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said only EU membership could guarantee access to the European single market. But Mr Grayling said people should think carefully about the sort of country they want the UK to become.
