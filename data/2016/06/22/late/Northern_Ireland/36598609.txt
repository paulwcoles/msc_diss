 The donors who have effectively been paying Seán Quinn's legal bills include business acquaintances and "close family connections", the High Court has been told. Almost 1.7m euro (£1.3m) has been paid out by the Erne Trust since 2012. The money was for legal bills and other fees incurred by the Quinn family. He suspects it is a "sham trust", which is a conduit for assets which have been concealed from him. Declan Taite was appointed receiver in 2012 at the request of IBRC, formerly known as Anglo-Irish Bank. He told the court that it is his job to identify, locate and collect assets. He added that the Quinn's have "openly admitted" they put property assets beyond the reach of IBRC and that those assets have "generated tens of millions of euros". He said he is trying to "understand the provenance" of the money in the trust to determine that it does not originate with the Quinn family. A list of donors including names, addresses and sums donated has now been given to Mr Taite. His barrister said the close family connections includes siblings, however, a barrister for the trust said he was "not aware" of a sibling connection. The trust's barrister added that it was "not surprising" that Mr Quinn's business acquaintances should support him. Mr Taite's barrister said that having received the list of names there may now be a need to gather further affidavit evidence. The case was adjourned until September.
