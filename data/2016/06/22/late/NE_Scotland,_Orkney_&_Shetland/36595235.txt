 A council chief executive is to look into the refusal of the authority's joint political leader to stay at a major conference in Denmark due to the accommodation not being good enough. Martin Kitts-Hayes, of the Progressive Independent Group on Aberdeenshire Council, was due to attend the North Sea Commission at the weekend. He instead returned home. It is believed the trip cost four figures. The council said his conduct would be investigated. Mr Kitts-Hayes has so far not responded to BBC Scotland for comment. Conservative group leader Jim Gifford said: "The council has spent a substantial amount of money sending people to a conference that they did not attend and that's the fundamental problem here." Mr Kitts-Hayes is the councillor for Inverurie and District, and is co council leader with the SNP's Richard Thomson.
