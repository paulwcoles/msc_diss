 Leading politicians in Wales will take part in a BBC EU referendum television debate later, on the final day of campaigning before the polls open. The programme, at Cardiff and Vale College, will also be broadcast on BBC Radio Wales. The debate was originally to take place last Friday in Swansea but was re-scheduled after the death of MP Jo Cox. Meanwhile Vote Leave campaigners published a letter signed by 62 small firms in Wales backing a Brexit vote.  Ahead of visiting a business in St Asaph, Denbighshire, Commons leader Chris Grayling said leaving the EU would free small firms from red tape and EU regulations. "Sadly, whilst the cost of EU membership is paid by all firms, it is the smallest firms - most of whom don't even export within the EU - who are being overwhelmed, without reaping the benefits of membership," he said. Mr Grayling's cabinet colleague and Remain campaigner Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns is also due to meet firms in north Wales, including the Toyota engine plant in Flintshire.  Mr Cairns said: "I will be pressing the case across north Wales to choose to keep access to the single market that supports 100,000 jobs in Wales.  "A vote for remain secures access to a market of 500m people, our largest goods trading partner."
