 The ongoing conflict with so-called Islamic State (IS) in Iraq has displaced almost 3.5 million people since January 2014.  At least 80,000 of them have fled Falluja, west of Baghdad, since government forces launched an assault to retake the city four weeks ago. Many of the displaced have ended up in camps that lack access to safe water, basic sanitation and medical care. Several camps have been seen outbreaks of diseases like measles and cholera due to poor hygiene conditions. Our correspondent Ahmed Maher visited one camp in Baghdad.
