 Hundreds of bees fitted with coloured number tags are being released from a London rooftop to help scientists find the insects' favourite haunts in the capital. Queen Mary University biologists hope the project will establish what are bees' preferred places for visiting flowers. Five hundred bees were released on Tuesday. They will be followed by several hundred more each week over the coming month as bee colonies mature.
