 In June 1997, an unmanned supply vessel crashed into the Mir space station.  The collision meant that the station began to leak air. The astronauts on board desperately tried to seal the leak. Michael Foale was one of the astronauts on board at the time. He spoke to Witness about surviving a crash in space.
