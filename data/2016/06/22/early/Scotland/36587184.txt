 Crossbows, rifles and pistols dating back to World War 2 are among thousands of air weapons surrendered during a police amnesty. Police Scotland said 11,569 weapons were handed in during a three-week amnesty with more than 1,000 handed in since then.  New laws will come into effect in December which will mean anyone with an airgun, crossbow or rifle, must have a licence for it. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said it is the first step in making Scotland's streets safer.
