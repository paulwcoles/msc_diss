 A man stamped on a barmaid's arm and dislocated her elbow when she tried to rouse him after he fell asleep in a Dundee pub, a court heard. James Craig dragged the woman to the ground and attacked her in the Union 39 bar last November. The 35-year-old admitted a charge of assault to severe injury at Dundee Sheriff Court. A sheriff told Craig he "faces a sentence measured in years" at his next court appearance in August. Depute fiscal Saima Rasheed said staff member Kirstyn Bruce attempted to wake Craig up near closing time on 27 November. Ms Rasheed said: "He pulled her by the arm and dragged her to the ground. "He punched her on the head and stamped on her arm. "He was later heard saying 'I hit a woman'." The court was told that Miss Bruce's lower arm was in an "unnatural position and pointing in the wrong direction."  Sheriff Alastair Brown deferred sentence for social work background reports and remanded Craig in custody. The sheriff said: "It is an appalling assault coupled with a significant injury. "He is looking at a sentence measured in years."
