 Conservationists have been showing some of the restoration work underway to safeguard the historic home of World War One poet Hedd Wyn. The farm - Yr Ysgwrn - in Gwynedd has been awarded nearly Â£3m in heritage lottery grants to transform it in memory of the poet. It will be a century next year since his death at Passchendaele. The poet's nephew Gerald Williams, who is now 87, grew up on the farm near Trawsfynydd. He told BBC Wales' George Herd why he had dedicated his life to keeping Hedd Wyn's memory alive.
