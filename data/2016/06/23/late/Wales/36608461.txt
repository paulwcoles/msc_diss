 Environment officials have said they are taking action to stop poachers taking fish from Welsh rivers. Natural Resources Wales operations manager Huwel Manley said enforcement officers acted on intelligence received from the fishing community to target illegal fishing. The comments come after anglers claimed the numbers of sewin or sea trout could be wiped out in Wales due to poaching, among other factors.
