 A pop-up space has brought together people working in the creative industries in Cardiff. Those behind the idea from Cardiff University are hoping it can become a permanent feature. Creative industries employ more than 50,000 people in Wales, a third of them self-employed. Although it is worth just over 5% of the Welsh economy, the sector has been one of the fastest growing over the last decade. Jewellery designer Jo Bollwell from Wentwood near Usk, Monmouthshire and fashion designer Kath Grimmit, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, have been at the hub for two days.
