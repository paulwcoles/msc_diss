 Uncertainty over the date when electrified trains will start running to Swansea is affecting potential investment, it has been claimed. Juliet Luporini, chairwoman of the city's business improvement district, said businesses wanted a fixed date before committing to the city. Network Rail said electrification would arrive between 2019 and 2024, but the exact date was "to be confirmed". The line is being electrified to speed up journey times from London to Wales. Mrs Luporini, who is also on the Swansea Bay City Region board, told BBC Wales it was "quite late in the day" for Network Rail not to be giving certainty over the date.
