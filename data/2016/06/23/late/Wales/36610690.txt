 A man from Rhondda Cynon Taff who beat a 17-month-old toddler to death with a garden chair has been jailed for life. Sean Buckley, 28, of Tonypandy, carried out a "deliberate" attack on Finley Thomas in September 2014, but claimed the boy had fallen down the stairs. Finley was taken to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales but died the next day. Buckley was found guilty of murder and child cruelty. His partner Chloe Thomas, Finley's mother, had already admitted child cruelty at Cardiff Crown Court. Speaking outside court, Det Insp Stuart Wales from South Wales Police said Finley died in the care of those who "should have kept him safe".
