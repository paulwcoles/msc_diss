 Voting is taking place in the referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union.  Polling places across the country will be open until 22:00, with the final result said to be expected at "breakfast time" on Friday.  Voters will be asked: "Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?" They will have the option to put a cross next to "Remain" or "Leave".  Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. In keeping with other broadcasters, the BBC is not allowed to report anything that might influence how people vote while the polls are open. Counting will be carried out in 382 counting areas - 380 local authorities across England, Scotland and Wales and one in Northern Ireland, and one in Gibraltar. The official declaration will be made at Manchester Town Hall, with the exact time dependent on the level of turnout and how close the result is.  The BBC will have comprehensive coverage online with live updates throughout polling day and overnight, as well as up-to-the minute results.  BBC One, the BBC News Channel and BBC Parliament will broadcast a results show hosted by David Dimbleby alongside BBC experts and special guests from 21:55, which will have regular updates from Scotland.  Coverage continues throughout the night and Sophie Raworth, Andrew Neil and Victoria Derbyshire will pick up the coverage on Friday morning. Viewers outside the UK can join the results programme on BBC World News. BBC Radio 4 will be broadcasting the EU referendum results in a programme from 23:00, that will run until Friday's Today programme at 06:00. BBC Radio 5 Live will also have live coverage as the results come in, and Good Morning Scotland will be on the air on BBC Radio Scotland from 06:00 with all the latest results, reaction and analysis.
