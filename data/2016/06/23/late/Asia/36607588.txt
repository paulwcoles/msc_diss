 Politicians, journalists and other prominent figures have been bemoaning the "national loss" of singer Amjad Sabri. Tweets condemning his killing are a top Twitter trend in Pakistan under the hashtags #AmjadSabri, #DGRangers and #CMSindh. Pakistani TV channels have been broadcasting Mr Sabri's programmes, while the papers consider both his legacy and the return of "lawlessness" to the city of Karachi. A Taliban splinter group has said it carried out the killing. Pakistan Today editor Arif Nizami on his talk show DNA on Channel 24 agrees. Describing Mr Sabri as a "sitting duck" as he had not been provided with adequate security, he blames "the police, Rangers and the provincial government... for this negligence".
