 A bio-chemist who secretly filmed men in a staff toilet in work has been spared jail and told to "prove he can change" by a judge. Footage from the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital was found when police searched his home in relation to an inquiry into images of child sexual abuse. Steven Wynne, of Wrexham, admitted making and possessing indecent images and voyeurism at Mold Crown Court. The 33-year-old was placed on a three year internet sex offender programme. He must also register with the police as a sex offender for five years, while a sexual harm prevention order was made. Judge Geraint Walters said Wynne, from Chirk, was an achiever who graduated with a bio-chemistry degree and found work at the hospital. "Outwardly your life was perfectly normal," he said. "But underneath all that there was a secret that only you knew." It was a secret which involved routinely accessing pornographic images of children, the court heard. Wynne was found to have also hidden mini cameras in the toilet cisterns of the the staff gents toilets at the Shropshire hospital. The judge told him: "It is hard to imagine someone sinking to greater depths while outwardly appearing decent and an achiever in the work place." He added that if Wynne was sent to prison it would have been a short sentence and he would emerge the same man. Instead, he said the sentence Wynne would receive would give him a chance to prove that he could change. The court heard he had been dismissed from his job and now carries out voluntary work.
