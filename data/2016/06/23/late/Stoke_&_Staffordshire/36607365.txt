 The BBC has filmed a traffic warden being verbally abused by the passenger of a car, parked illegally outside a school in Staffordshire. For the first time, cameras were granted exclusive access to the traffic warden department at Stoke-on-Trent City Council. It follows an increase in the number of verbal and physical assaults on the city's traffic enforcement team. They now wear body cameras to record everything they see. Lyn who's been a traffic warden for almost a decade said: "People respond violently sometimes and colleagues have been threatened, squared up to, spat in the face and headbutted." She urged people to "look past the uniform, there's a person in there. We're not robots".
