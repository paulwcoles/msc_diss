 A provisional trial date has been set for the man accused of murdering MP Jo Cox. The Batley and Spen MP, 41, was shot and stabbed in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on 16 June.  Thomas Mair, 52, was told by an Old Bailey judge that a provisional trial had been fixed for 14 November.  He is also charged with grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon. Mrs Cox was attacked shortly before she was due to hold a constituency surgery. Mr Mair, from Birstall, appeared at the Old Bailey via videolink from Belmarsh Prison.  He only spoke to confirm his name.  A plea and case management hearing is due to take place in October.
