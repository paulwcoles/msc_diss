 A lorry carrying frozen offal has overturned on the M40 in Oxfordshire, causing miles of tailbacks in both directions. The articulated lorry crashed through the central reservation near junction 6 in south Oxfordshire, partially blocking both carriageways. The driver has been taken to hospital with a suspected ankle injury. Two lanes remain closed in both directions while recovery work continues. The southbound carriageway was completely blocked following the crash, which happened between junctions 6 and 7, near Watlington at about 12:30 BST. Congestion is stretching back in either direction to junction 9, Bicester, and to junction 5, Stokenchurch. Thames Valley Police said recovery work was expected to continue until at least 18:00. Motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
