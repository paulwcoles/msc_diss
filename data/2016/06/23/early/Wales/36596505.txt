 Journalists have urged the Welsh Assembly to scrutinise what they call the "ludicrous" behaviour of news publishers Trinity Mirror. The Daily Post is scrapping its Senedd reporter and will cover Cardiff Bay politics from north Wales by a journalist also covering transport. Trinity Mirror said it "remains committed to covering Welsh politics at a local and national level".  But the National Union of Journalists said it risked leaving readers uninformed. Plaid Cymru's Ynys Mon MP Rhun ap Iorwerth has written to the company asking it to look again, saying it was "hugely disappointing" and a "step backwards" in the reporting of assembly politics.
