 A tenant who bludgeoned his landlord to death in Swansea and dumped his body 140 miles away has been convicted of murder. Alec Warburton, 59, was hit in the back of the head with a hammer by David Craig Ellis at his Sketty home in July. His body was found in a disused quarry in Dolwyddelan, Conwy county, in September. Ellis, 41, was found guilty at Swansea Crown Court on Wednesday and will be sentenced on Thursday. Nick Palit reports.
