 The M4 at Bridgend has reopened after a lorry fire led to hold-ups. The vehicle fire was extinguished overnight but the westbound carriageway was closed at Junction 36 near Sarn Service Area to allow for a clean-up. Two lanes of the motorway were initially reopened during the Wednesday morning rush-hour but all lanes have since reopened. An earlier diversion via the exit slip road has also been lifted.
