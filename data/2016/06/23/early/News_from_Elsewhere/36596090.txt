 A group of Italian senators is calling for pizza makers to pass exams in order to guarantee the quality of their creations. The senators say around four million pizzas are eaten every day in Italy, and they want to ensure each one is up to standard. "Italy has great responsibility that derives from the fact that 'Made in Italy' is one of the best-known brands in the world," says the bill's initiator, Senator Bartolomeo Amidei. "In this context, there's no room for improvisation, and pizza makers should be valued and recognised."
