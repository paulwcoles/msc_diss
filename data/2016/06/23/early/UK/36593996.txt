 The grandfather of Ellie Butler has been telling the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme about his "beautiful" grandchild. Six-year-old Ellie was murdered by her father Ben Butler, 36, just 11 months after she was returned to his care following a custody battle. He inflicted catastrophic head injuries upon Ellie while looking after her at their home in Sutton, south-west London, in October 2013. He was also found guilty of child cruelty over a shoulder injury, as was Ellie's mother Jennie Gray.  He was jailed for a minimum of 23 years. Gray was jailed for 42 months. Ellie's grandfather Neal Gray said the sentence should have been more severe - and that he had disowned his daughter.
