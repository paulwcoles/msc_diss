 Sir Cliff Richard has said he felt like "collateral damage" after being told he will not face charges on allegations of historical sexual abuse. Last week, the Crown Prosecution Service dropped its case, citing "insufficient evidence".   The singer has threatened to sue South Yorkshire Police and the BBC, which filmed a raid on his house at the start of the investigation two years ago.  Sir Cliff was speaking to Susanna Reid on ITV's Good Morning Britain.
