 A Scottish woman jailed in Peru for smuggling drugs has arrived back in Glasgow after being released from jail. Melissa Reid, 22, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, was arrested with Michaella McCollum, of Co Tyrone, after being caught with 24lb (11kg) of cocaine at Lima airport in 2013. She touched down in Glasgow at 21:44 after travelling from Lima, via Amsterdam, with her father William.  She did not appear before waiting media at the international arrivals area, and is thought to have accepted an airside transfer. It is understood that Reid will not have a criminal record in the UK as a result of her Peruvian conviction. Any offences she committed in the UK before she became a drugs mule would remain.  Reid has served about a third of her sentence and under Peruvian law was eligible to be deported according to the early release scheme for foreign prisoners.  She has also paid a fine of 10,000 Peruvian soles, just over £2,000. A spokeswoman for Peru's prison service, Janeth Sanchez, said Reid "served her time in prison according to the law and can now go to her country, free". A Scottish Prison Service spokeswoman confirmed it was not involved with Reid's case. Both Reid and McCollum were caught with an estimated £1.5m-worth of cocaine at Lima airport on 6 August 2013 while attempting to board a flight to Madrid, in Spain. The cocaine was discovered in food packets hidden inside their luggage. They had initially claimed they were forced to carry the drugs, but pleaded guilty to charges later that year. They had faced the prospect of a maximum 15-year prison term but struck a behind closed doors plea bargain to secure a shorter sentence. Reid's father William has previously said the impact of his daughter's imprisonment on his family had been "horrendous". A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: "We continue to provide assistance to Melissa Reid and remain in contact with her family and local authorities."
