 Historical artefacts from the League of Nations - which aimed to establish peace after World War One - have gone on display in Aberystwyth. The exhibition commemorates the International Federation of League of Nations Societies' visit to the town 90 years ago. It includes photographs and newspaper extracts from the time and is on show at Aberystwyth University's Hugh Owen Library. The display runs until 29 June. The university was chosen for the 1926 congress - held to mark Germany's admission to the League of Nations - after objections were raised to Dresden being chosen as the venue. David Davies, then MP for Montgomeryshire, was the university's president and offered Aberystwyth as an alternative venue, saving the congress. In the following years, it was held in Berlin, The Hague, Prague, Madrid, Brussels and Geneva.
