 A Singapore Airlines flight caught fire while making an emergency landing. All passengers and crew were safely evacuated. The Boeing 777-300 plane took off from Singapore's Changi airport for Milan at 02:05 local time on Monday (18:00 GMT Sunday) but turned back because of a fuel leak, a passenger said. After touching down in Changi, the right engine caught fire. Emergency services put out the flames shortly afterwards.
