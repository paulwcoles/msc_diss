But it also warns that there is a "shocking gulf" between remedies offered by the political elites - closer integration, especially in economic terms - and the expectations of ordinary Europeans.

"They are dragging Western Europe towards its downfall."

"In the face of a real threat to the [European] Union, Poland's political leaders must stand together to fight for European unity," he urges. "Do not follow the British. Build Europe".
