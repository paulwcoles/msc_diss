 A ceremony has been held in Tunisia to remember the 38 tourists shot dead on a beach exactly one year ago.   Thirty of those killed in the resort town of Sousse were British.  The attack, claimed by the so-called Islamic State, was the greatest loss of British life in a terrorist incident since the July 2005 London bombing. Orla Guerin reports from Sousse.
