 Gwent Police is set to hand a report to air accident investigators after a light plane is recovered from the A40 in Monmouthshire. Three people sustained minor injuries when the four-seater Piper Warrior II aircraft came down between Abergavenny and Raglan on Saturday afternoon. The dual carriageway was closed for several hours before the plane was finally hauled on to a lorry, to be transported to the Air Accident Investigation Branch headquarters in Hampshire.
