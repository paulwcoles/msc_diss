 At least 10 people have been wounded, two seriously, in clashes between right-wing extremists and counter-protesters in Sacramento, California. Police said about 30 members of a white supremacist group were holding a rally outside the California State Capitol when about 400 counter-protesters turned up and fights broke out. Nine men and one woman were treated for stab wounds, cuts and bruises, officials said. No arrests have been reported so far. Video posted on social media showed dozens of people, some wearing masks and wielding what appeared to be wooden bats, racing across the capitol grounds and attacking others. The two people seriously wounded had suffered stab wounds, Sacramento Fire Department spokesman Chris Harvey said. "There was a large number of people carrying sticks and rushing to either get into the melee or see what was going on," he said. Matthew Heimbach, chairman of white supremacist group the Traditionalist Worker Party (TWP), told the Los Angeles Times that his group and the Golden State Skinheads had organised the rally.  He said one of their marchers had been stabbed in an artery and six of the counter-protesters had also been stabbed.  TWP vice chairman Matt Parrott, who was at the rally, blamed "leftist radicals" for the violence.
