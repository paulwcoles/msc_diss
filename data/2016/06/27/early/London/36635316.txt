 Passengers had to use an emergency slide to evacuate from an American Airlines plane at Heathrow Airport after smoke billowed from its tail. The evacuation happened at Terminal 3 on Sunday morning. A Heathrow spokeswoman said a "technical issue" was identified and the problem was resolved. A passenger on a flight from Helsinki, Ross Hiscock, said he saw "smoke coming from the tail-end of the plane" parked next to his and saw passengers escape.
