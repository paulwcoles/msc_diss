 A pig which escaped from a lorry and got loose on to a motorway in Monmouthshire is no longer on the carriageway. The swift swine made his bid for freedom on the M48 between junction 2 for Chepstow and Junction 1 for Aust at about 06:40 BST on Thursday. The speed limit was temporarily lowered to 50mph (80km/h). Although the animal is no longer on the road, it is not known if it has been caught.
