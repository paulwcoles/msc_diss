 A new drone park is being set up in South Korea's capital city, allowing people to fly the devices freely. Drone operators will have to plan ahead for their outings, though. The park will only be open to 30 devices at a time, and people will have to book a space ahead of time, on a first-come, first-served basis. It will also be limited to devices weighing up to 12kg (1.9 stone), and there's an altitude limit of 150m (492ft).
