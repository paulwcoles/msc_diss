 An aerobatics display by the Red Arrows has been cancelled because it was no longer considered appropriate in the wake of the Shoreham air disaster. The team's Farnborough Air Show performance has been dropped in favour of flypasts, organisers said. An RAF spokesperson said the "high speed and dynamic nature of the traditional Red Arrows' display is no longer appropriate". The team is due to fly at the show between 15-17 July. The RAF's statement said the routine had been changed "due to the large amounts of local housing, business areas and major transport links underneath the planned display area." The announcement comes following an assessment of the risk associated with the team's flying display at the biennial air show.
