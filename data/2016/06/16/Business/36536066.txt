 (Close): The FTSE 100 recovered some of the ground lost in Tuesday's sell-off as shares in mining companies rose. The benchmark share index fell below 6,000 on Tuesday for the first time since February on worries over rising support for the UK leaving the EU. All eyes will be on the US Federal Reserve later as it announces the outcome of its latest policy meeting. The US central bank is not expected to announce a rise in interest rates, but its statement will be examined closely for clues as to the timing of a rise later this year.  The company also reported a 9% fall in full-year profits to Â£530.9m. The company said it had made a good start to the year and was trading in line with its expectations.
