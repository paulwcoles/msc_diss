 (Noon): The FTSE 100 was still lower in midday Thursday trading as traders remain weighed down by uncertainty about the global economy. The Bank of England said issued another warning about the risks posed by a vote to leave Europe at midday, saying sterling would fall further. Sentiment was not helped by the US Federal Reserve, which last night said it would keep interest rates on hold as growth prospects remain uncertain. It also pointed to the possibility of Brexit as a factor that was holding it off from taking action on rates.  The vote is influencing the US Treasury's own actions.  It said it would bring forward a planned government bond auction to the day before the vote. The US holds back from raising government debt on dates it believes the market will be edgy or unstable, for example, on days when the Federal Reserve gives its verdict on interest rates.
