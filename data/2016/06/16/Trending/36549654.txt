 Fans have been offering Iceland's captain Aron Gunnarsson the shirts off their backs after he was snubbed by Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo following the final whistle of the two nations' Euro 2016 match on Wednesday,  It's deep in injury time, Portugal and Iceland are level at 1-1 and Cristiano Ronaldo is lining up a free kick. He runs up and, as the ball hits a wall of Icelandic players, the referee blows the final whistle. Cue wild celebrations from the the smallest nation ever to reach a major tournament. Ronaldo stormed off the pitch, ignoring attempts from Iceland's captain to swap shirts, a gesture which has become something of a tradition for footballers.  The Real Madrid star further compounded the offence by describing his opponents as "lucky" and appearing to disdain the Iceland fans by saying: "I thought they'd won the Euros the way they celebrated at the end. It was unbelievable." Many of those offering to give up their shirts appear to be Turkish fans have been especially keen to back the Cardiff City player. It's possible that the nationality of the referee, Cuneyt Ã‡akir, who is Turkish, may have been a factor. Ronaldo was critical of the referee immediately after the game ended.
