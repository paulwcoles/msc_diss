 A "four-day party" celebrating the world of literature is under way with the annual Borders Book Festival. The 13th edition is being staged at the Harmony Gardens in Melrose until Sunday. More than 100 events include the likes of thriller writer Frederick Forsyth, comedian Sara Pascoe and former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Director Alistair Moffat said it promised to be a "truly memorable book festival" as well as a "great day out". "Festivals need to be festive and festive means fun - and fascinating," he said. "The Borders Book Festival aims to be like a wonderful four-day party where you meet people who make you laugh and also make you think." Among the highlights being flagged up by organisers are: Nearly 2,000 children and teachers from primary schools across the Borders are expected to attend a special gala day on Thursday.
