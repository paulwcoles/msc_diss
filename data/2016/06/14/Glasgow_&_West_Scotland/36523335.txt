 MSPs are to hold a minute's silence in the Scottish Parliament debating chamber later in memory of those killed in the Florida nightclub shooting. The rainbow Pride flag was flown over the Scottish government's headquarters. The attack at the Pulse nightclub, in which 49 people were killed and 53 injured, is the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history. It ended when police shot Mateen dead.  On Monday, flags at Holyrood were flown at half mast as a mark of respect. When parliament meets later, for the first time since the shooting, a minute's silence will be held. Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh tweeted: "Tomorrow the @ScotParl will fall silent as we come together to remember those who lost their lives in #Orlando. #LoveWins #LoveIsLove." There will also be a topical question from Labour's Claire Baker MSP who will ask what action the Scottish government is taking to tackle hate crimes against LGBTI people. Watch the proceedings at the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood Live from 14:00. More than 600 people attended the hour-long vigil in George Square in Glasgow, with flowers laid and candles lit. The organisers, from the Free Pride Glasgow group, said they felt it was important to provide "a place where people could come and be around friends and get support from people and show solidarity with the people in Orlando". A similar vigil has also been organised in Edinburgh on Wednesday. Earlier on Monday, the Pride flag was raised at the Scottish Government's headquarters in Edinburgh. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: "Scotland stands in solidarity with the people of Orlando, and LGBTI communities across the world." The flag was also flown at half mast above Glasgow City Chambers, overlooking George Square.
