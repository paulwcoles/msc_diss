 (Close): The FTSE 100 fell and the pound slipped as investors stayed cautious ahead of the UK's EU referendum next week. Meanwhile, the "volatility index" for the pound - a measure of investors' uncertainty - has hit the highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis. Opinion polls at the weekend suggested the Leave campaign was ahead of the Remain team, and figures from betting exchange Betfair indicate the implied probability of the UK staying in the EU has fallen to 64%, down from 78% a week earlier. Investors were also cautious ahead of a US Federal Reserve's meeting later this week. "Financial markets are in a clear risk-off mode once more this week," said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG. "The Brexit-shaped shadow that looms over markets is also joined by a [Fed] meeting this week, which while predictable by action, is less certain by tone. There is a high likeliness that at a time where risks are so high, market sentiment will continue to drive volatility for the next 10 days." However, Deutsche Bank said a Leave vote would not necessarily hit UK shares. Both the German bank and JP Morgan remained "overweight" on UK shares, helping the FTSE fall less sharply than continental stock markets.  "In the case of a Leave vote in the UK referendum... we expect UK equities to outperform the European market, given the likely [sterling] depreciation in such a scenario," Deutsche analysts said in a note.
