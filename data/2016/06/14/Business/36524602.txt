 Shares in US gun companies rose on Monday following Sunday's attack on the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, in which 49 people were killed. Smith & Wesson shares closed up 6.9% while competitor Sturm, Ruger and Company saw its shares finish up 8.5%. Shares in US firearm manufacturers typically rise after a mass shooting. Investors predict that buyers will worry about tougher gun laws being introduced and therefore gun sales will increase.  The right to bear arms in the US is enshrined in the country's constitution.
