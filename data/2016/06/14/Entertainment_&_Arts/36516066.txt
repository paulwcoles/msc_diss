 Stars have been reacting on social media to the tragic shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, which left 50 dead on Sunday. A number of gay celebrities have also voiced their support for the LGBT community and victims, including Ricky Martin and Ellen Page. JK Rowling expressed her grief after hearing one of the victims worked on a Harry Potter ride at Universal Studios. The author later said she was praying for another victim who is said to be in intensive care.  At the Isle of Wight festival, Queen and guest vocalist Adam Lambert dedicated the song Who Wants to Live Forever to the victims. An emotional Lambert introduced the track, saying: "This song is dedicated to those who lost their lives in Orlando, Florida, and anyone who has been a victim of senseless violence or hatred."
