 A woman who left an abusive voice message for a grieving mother is an employee of the NHS trust in charge of the mental health unit where her son died, police have said. Sara Ryan has campaigned for changes at Southern Health since her son, Connor Sparrowhawk, drowned in a bath in 2013. Thames Valley Police said the caller, who called Dr Ryan a "vindictive" and a "nasty cow", had been given a caution. Southern Health said the employee was being dealt with internally. A spokesman said the trust was taking the matter "very seriously" and were dealing with the employee through a "robust internal process". Police have not named the caller. The caller told Dr Ryan: "You know as much as anyone else knows that Southern Health only took over those units in Oxfordshire [in] the recent months before your son died. "You know with your background it takes a while to make changes... and I think now... you want some attention, but you are vindictive and you are unpleasant and you are a nasty cow." Southern Health provides specialist mental health and learning disability services in Hampshire, Dorset, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire.
