 A 45-year-old man has been killed in a crash involving a motorbike and a tractor towing a trailer. The accident happened on the A72 near Clovenfords in the Borders at about 19:20 on Monday near the entrance for Caddonlee Farm. The motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident. Police have asked anyone who witnessed the crash or may have seen the dark Kawasaki or the tractor before the incident to contact them.  Sgt Neil Inglis said: "Tragically another life has been lost in a collision on our roads.  "The next of kin have been informed and we are providing them with support at this difficult time.  "As a result of this incident a stretch of road between Clovenfords and Walkerburn was closed for around 10 hours to allow for collision investigation work to be carried out." He said they understood the motorbike had been travelling east on the A72 before turning north at the Nest roundabout. "The tractor appears to have been crossing the roadway in order to access a neighbouring field when the collision occurred," he added. "We're still looking into the full set of circumstances that led up to this incident and today I urge anyone who saw either vehicle prior to the collision itself to come forward if they have not already done so."
