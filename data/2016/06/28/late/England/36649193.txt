 Three former school workers have been arrested in connection with allegations of historical abuse at Gloucestershire and Wiltshire schools. Gloucestershire Police said the men had been questioned over allegations of physical and sexual abuse at three privately run special schools. The men worked at Badgeworth Court and Dowdeswell Court near Cheltenham, and Clouds House near Salisbury. The allegations date to the 1960s and 1980s and the schools are now closed. The investigation is being led by officers from Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Avon and Somerset Police forces. All three men have been granted police bail to appear at a later date.
