 A huge sink hole has appeared in a Carmarthenshire village just metres away from homes. Residents of Towy View Park, off Capel Dewi Road, near Carmarthen, were alerted to a sinkhole, measuring about 30ft (9m) wide and deep, shortly before 07:00 BST on Tuesday. It has left a storage shed dangerously close to the edge.
