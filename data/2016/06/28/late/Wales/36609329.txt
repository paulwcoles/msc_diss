 The new artistic director of Theatr Clwyd is making her debut at the Mold theatre in what is its 400th production. Tamara Harvey, who began her career at Shakespeare's Globe in London, is directing Shakespeare's comedy Much Ado About Nothing. It is being set in 1960s Portmeirion, which she says is ideal for the story of a small Italian community. Here is an extract of a scene with John Ramm as Benedick and Lisa Palfrey as Beatrice. The play runs until 2 July.
