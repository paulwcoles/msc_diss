 A counter-terrorism training exercise has been staged by South Wales and Dyfed-Powys Police to test the response of emergency services to such an attack. Scenarios are based on "prevailing" threats following attacks in France and Belgium, said the officer in charge. The two-day exercise is being held at locations including Ffos Las racecourse near Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire. People have been told not to be concerned by noise of blank gun fire and simulated explosions in the area.
