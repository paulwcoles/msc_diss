 Nicola Sturgeon has begun establishing a council of experts to advise the Scottish government in light of the UK vote in favour of Brexit. Council members' expertise in finance, economics, European and diplomatic matters; will help inform thinking on a range of political and constitutional views. The first minister said her three priorities are to: protect Scotland's relationship and place in the EU, to provide clarity for businesses and to reaffirm her welcome for people from other countries who live in Scotland. The council will be chaired by Prof Anton Muscatelli of Glasgow University.
