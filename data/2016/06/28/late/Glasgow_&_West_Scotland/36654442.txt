 The leaders of the main political parties in Scotland have given their reaction to EU referendum vote and Nicola Sturgeon's response.  Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson cautioned against a second independence referendum highlighting the value of the UK as a trade partner. But the Tories themselves came in for criticism from Scottish Labour's Kezia Dugdale who claimed it was time for the party to accept responsibility for the Brexit vote. Scottish Green's co-convener Patrick Harvie said the result reflected an out-of-touch "political mainstream" while Scottish Liberal Democrats leader Willie Rennie listed the things that would be lost by leaving the EU.
