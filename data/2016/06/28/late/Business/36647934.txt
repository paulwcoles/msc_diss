 Japanese shares on Tuesday continued to roll back losses from last Friday's sharp post-Brexit tumble.  But with the yen remaining strong, Japanese exporters continued to suffer. A rise in the yen makes Japanese goods more expensive abroad, potentially damaging the prospects of the country's crucial export sector.  On Monday, the government in Tokyo had tried to reassure businesses by promising it would take action if needed to rein in the yen.  Carmakers Toyota, Nissan and Honda - all of which have production sites in the UK - all saw their shares fall on Tuesday.  Shares in other exporters, such as Hitachi, Panasonic and Yamaha, also dropped.  Australia's ASX/200 in Sydney fell 0.7% to close at 5,103.30. South Korea's benchmark Kospi index was lower in morning trade but ended the day 0.5% higher at 1,936.22. Shares in Europe, the UK and the US saw heavy losses on Monday with the uncertainty over the UK's economic future intensifying.
