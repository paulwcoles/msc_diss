 A lorry driver has been charged over a crash involving a bus and a low-loader carrying a steam engine which injured 23 people. The collision happened in East Mersea, Essex, in September last year. Bus driver Michael Birch, had to be cut free from his cabin and later said he thought he "would die". Essex Police said Philip Last, 52, of Northgate Street, Great Yarmouth, had been charged with six counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He is due to appear at Colchester Magistrates' Court next month.
