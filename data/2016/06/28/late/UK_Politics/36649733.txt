 Scottish MEP Alyn Smith has urged members of the European Parliament to stand by his country following the UK referendum on EU membership.    The UK as a whole voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave, but Scotland voted by 62% to 38% in favour of remaining within the EU. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to do all she can to ensure Scotland stays a part of the group.
