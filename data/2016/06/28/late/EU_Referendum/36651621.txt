 Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson has urged the European Parliament to respect the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland to remain a part of the European Union.  But in an address to MEPs she also attacked the European Commission and European Council for their "anti-democratic practices and anti-social policies".  The UK as a whole voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave to EU in a referendum last week, but Northern Ireland voted by 55.8% to 44.2% to remain.
