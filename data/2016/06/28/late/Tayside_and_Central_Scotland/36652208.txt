 A 27-year-old man will stand trial in July accused of walking naked around Stirling University's library. Neil Cox faces a charge of indecent exposure following the alleged incident in the university's library, near Bridge of Allan, in January. He is alleged to have "repeatedly sat naked on a chair" and walked unclothed in the library. It is alleged that in doing so, he knowingly exposed his private parts to a female borrower. Mr Cox, of Bristol, is accused of carrying out the act "in a sexual manner". He pleaded not guilty to the charge at Stirling Sheriff Court. His solicitor, Stephen Maguire, asked for the case to be continued. He said he wanted to discuss his client's intentions with the prosecutor dealing with the case, who is presently on holiday. Mr Maguire said that if the Crown accepted Mr Cox's actions were not sexual, a plea might be agreed to a simple breach of the peace. At an earlier hearing, the court was told that Cox "did not dispute that certain things took place", but what was at issue was whether they amounted to the common law offence of breach of the peace -- or a sexual offence as presently charged. Sheriff Robert Dickson continued the case until 18 July for discussions to take place, and set trial for 25 July.
