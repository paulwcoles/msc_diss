 As the prime minister travels to Brussels to meet European Union leaders for the first time since the UK voted to leave the bloc, the race to succeed him comes under the spotlight. "Although Mr Johnson's support is patchy within the parliamentary party, allies are attempting to build unstoppable momentum behind his campaign by urging other potential candidates to step aside," reports the paper. The result, says the Times, questions the assumption Mr Johnson is the darling of party activists after his campaign for Brexit triumphed in the EU referendum. Elsewhere, the turmoil in the Labour Party following the mass resignation of shadow cabinet members over leader Jeremy Corbyn's handling of the EU referendum continues to attract headlines. In a leading article on its front page, the Mirror says: "The country is in the biggest crisis for decades and so is the Labour Party.... While he is a decent and principled man, it is now clear he is not cut out to unite and lead Labour through these turbulent times and beat the Tories in a snap general election." "That, I think, would be a disaster for British politics. Not only do we need a strong and focused  opposition, but Britain genuinely needs a sane Labour Party." England's 2-1 defeat to Iceland at Euro 2016 is widely described as a "humiliation". "Whatever else happened in that time, his period in charge will probably always be remembered for the full-on humiliation that accompanied this defeat and the knowledge it will rank among the more infamous results in the history of the national team." The papers do, however, find room to hail a British sporting success after Marcus Willis pulled off what is being described as one of the biggest upsets at Wimbledon. Willis had given up on his tennis career and was making plans to move to the US to start a coaching job before his new girlfriend persuaded him to give the sport one last chance, it reports.
