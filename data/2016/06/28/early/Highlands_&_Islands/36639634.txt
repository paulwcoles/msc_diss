 A hillwalker who was reported missing after heading out for a trek on Sunday has been found safe on a hill near Loch Kishorn, police have said. Mark Flinn, 68, failed to return to his accommodation in Achintraid in Wester Ross after planning walks in the hills near the loch. Searches for him involved mountain rescue teams, search dogs and an Inverness-based coastguard helicopter. Police Scotland said Mr Flinn was found at about 14:30. The force said that he required "slight" medical attention for the effects of being outdoors overnight in cold temperatures. He has been airlifted to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness for treatment. Torridon and Kinlochewe and RAF mountain rescue teams as well as Sarda Scotland search dogs began searching for Mr Flinn on Sunday and continued the effort on Monday morning.
