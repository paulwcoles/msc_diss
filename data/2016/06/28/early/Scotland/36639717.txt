 Seven children and two adults remain in hospital after a rollercoaster crash at M and D's theme park, near Motherwell, on Sunday. Three of the children are said to be in a serious condition.  Euan McLean, who was waiting in the queue for the Tsunami ride with his nine-year-old daughter, told BBC Scotland he became concerned watching the ride before the crash happened. A spokesperson for the park has said they are co-operating fully with an investigation by the  Health and Safety Executive.
