 The management of a theme park where a rollercoaster crashed, injuring 10 people, say they are heartbroken that anyone was injured on the ride. Douglas Taylor, a director of M&D's, said he and his brother are sorry that anyone was hurt. Mr Taylor said the Tsunami ride was checked every day by the park's own engineers and had its annual check in June. The health and safety executive and Police Scotland are investigating why several cars were derailed on Sunday.
