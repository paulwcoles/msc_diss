 A Black Country woman whose father, brother and son were shot dead by a gunman on a Tunisian beach a year ago has said she carries the grief every day. Suzanne Richards said her family had been "cut in half" by the attack in Sousse in which 38 people died.  Adrian Evans, 49, from Tipton in the West Midlands, died along with his father, 78-year-old Charles (known as Patrick) Evans, and nephew Joel Richards, 19.
