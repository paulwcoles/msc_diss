 A street in central Sydney will be ripped up and then re-laid every weekend for the next six months as part of work on a new light rail line. Workers have been tasked with digging up 120m (394ft) of road surface in order to map the location of utility pipes and cables and clear out items like old railway sleepers - remnants of a tram line which closed more than 50 years ago.  They'll then have to lay new asphalt and repaint all the road markings within 48 hours, repeating the process for 24 weekends on the trot in order to keep traffic flowing. The first portion of work has just been completed, with the road being dug up on Saturday, replaced on Sunday and back in use on Monday morning, the report says.  "It is one of the most complex intersections we have on the project and it's also one of the longest," project director Glenn Bentley tells the paper. "This is probably one of the most important phases, clearing the way so we can put down the slabs for the light rail line."
