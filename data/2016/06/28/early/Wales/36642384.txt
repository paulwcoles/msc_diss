 Nia Griffith has quit as Shadow Welsh Secretary, claiming Jeremy Corbyn cannot unite the Labour party.   More than half of Mr Corbyn's front bench team has resigned, accusing him of a half-hearted campaign to remain in the EU, helping to hand referendum victory to the Brexit camp. Ms Griffith said with the Tories in "chaos" after David Cameron's resignation, Labour needed to present a "united front" to fight a general election which she expected soon.
