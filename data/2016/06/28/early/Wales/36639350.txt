 The Conservatives need a leader who can unite the country following the vote to leave the EU, Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has said. David Cameron announced his resignation on Friday morning after leading the defeated campaign to remain in the union. The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP, who might be a contender himself, said whoever takes over as prime minister must be someone who can talk to Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. "This is a really serious moment for our country," he said. "This isn't just about party unity now - it's about national unity."
