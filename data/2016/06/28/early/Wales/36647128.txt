 A Labour MP has offered to contribute to the building of a statue of David Cameron in Wales.    Rhondda's Chris Bryant jokingly said he would "do a deal" with the prime minister over EU funding.  During a House of Commons debate, Mr Bryant made the statue pledge if Mr Cameron matches the money Wales currently receives. There are fears that Wales could lose out on cash following the UK's decision to leave the EU.
