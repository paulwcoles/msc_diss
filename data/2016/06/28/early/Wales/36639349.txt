 Rhondda MP Chris Bryant quit as Labour's shadow leader of the house in protest at Jeremy Corbyn's refusal to step down, he has said. He was one of more than a dozen front bench spokespeople to resign over Mr Corbyn's performance during the EU referendum campaign. Mr Bryant said voters did not know whether the Labour leader was supporting Remain or Leave.
