 Japanese shares on Tuesday continued to roll back losses from last Friday's sharp post-Brexit tumble.  With the yen remaining strong, Japanese exporters though continued to suffer. Any rise in the yen will make Japanese goods more expensive abroad, hurting the prospect of the country's crucial export sector.  On Monday, the government in Tokyo had tried to reassure by promising it would take action if needed to reign in the yen.  Car makers Toyota, Nissan and Honda - all of which have production sites in the UK - were all down on Tuesday.  Other exporters like Hitachi, Panasonic or Yamaha have also all seen losses in Tuesday trade.  Shares in Europe, the UK and the US have all continued to see heavy losses on Monday with the uncertainty over the UK's economic future intensifying.  Australia's ASX/200 in Sydney was down by 0.6% to 5,105.30. South Korea's benchmark Kospi index was lower in morning trade but traded 0.5% higher to 1,937.53 at noon.
