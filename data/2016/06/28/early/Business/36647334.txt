 Business Secretary Sajid Javid will on Tuesday hold a meeting of UK business groups to discuss the fallout from the UK vote to leave the European Union. Leaders from the CBI, Institute of Directors (IoD) and British Chambers of Commerce will be among those attending. Mr Javid wants their views on what the UK's relationship with the European Union should look like in the future. On Monday Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, told the BBC's Today programme: "Business leaders are very, very concerned. Nearly half of them expect the other member states to punish Britain." Speaking ahead of the meeting, the business secretary said: "My objective now is to ensure that the negotiation of our future relationship with the EU is carried out in the interest of UK companies, investors, potential investors and workers. "I want to do that hand in glove with businesses and that's why I'll be sitting down with leaders of Britain's biggest business organisations and industry representatives to hear their views." More than 20 representatives of business groups and figures from the UK's most important industries are due to attend the meeting. Those attending the meeting include the EEF, which represents manufacturing;  the BBA, which represents banks and the British Retail Consortium (BRC). It also warned that: "A prolonged fall in the value of the pound will impact import costs and ultimately consumer prices, but this will take time to feed through." It said it wanted "a clear and defined negotiating position" before the triggering of Article 50, which would mark the official start of a two-year negotiation of Britain's exit from the European Union.
