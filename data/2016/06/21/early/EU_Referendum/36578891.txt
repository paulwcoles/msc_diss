 Employment Minister and EU Leave supporter Priti Patel says her side has been setting out a "very clear and positive case" during the referendum campaign. She says Conservative peer Baroness Warsi, who criticised what she called the "hate and xenophobia" of the Leave campaign, was "entitled to her view". But she said Vote Leave had been focusing on "decision-making and democracy".
