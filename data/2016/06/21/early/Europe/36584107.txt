Streets around the City 2 shopping centre were closed off and a bomb disposal unit sent to the scene. No explosives were found and the suspect is being questioned, the prosecutor's office said. "For the moment, the situation is under control," Prime Minister Charles Michel said after a meeting the national crisis response centre, according to the Le Soir daily. He said security services remained "extremely vigilant". Belgium's terror alert level remains at three, one step down from a maximum level of four.
