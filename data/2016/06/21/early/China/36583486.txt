 A video has surfaced online showing staff at a Chinese bank being publicly spanked for poor performance, sparking outrage. They give answers including "failing to make a personal breakthrough". He then says "get your butts ready" and proceeds to spank them with what appears to be a thick wooden slab. The incident took place at a Rural Commercial Bank in Changzhi, northern China, People's Daily said. The Beijing Times said two executives from a Chinese bank have been suspended.  The video, which first surfaced Monday, appears to have been taken by someone in the audience on a smartphone. It shows at least four rounds of spanking, with one woman recoiling each time, apparently in pain. The course trainer, who reports said was the person doing the spanking, later issued a public apology, according to the South China Morning Post. However, people online have been expressing outrage over the treatment of staff. "When I first saw this, I thought it was another cheap public relations stunt from a bank but I can't believe this is real," said one Weibo user.  "This is nothing but degrading and it's so obscene to watch, where are the leadership values?"  Others called for harsh punishment for the bank.  "Expose this rotten company and the awful leadership it claims to possess. This company should be closed down if it thinks it can get away with treating its employees like that."
