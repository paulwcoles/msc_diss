 Rail passengers across Scotland will face disruption on Tuesday as the first in a series of rail strikes begins.   Talks to avert the planned strikes have broken down at the conciliation service ACAS. Members of the RMT union have refused to discuss a plan to remove guards from long-distance railway services. They say passenger safety will be put at risk while Scotrail say that will not be the case.  BBC Scotland's Andrew Kerr has the details.
