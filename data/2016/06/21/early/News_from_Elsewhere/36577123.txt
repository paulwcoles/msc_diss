 Giving birth in a Siberian forest during bear-mating season wouldn't be most women's first choice, but that's what happened to one new mother in Russia. But the remote location posed a challenge for paramedics - they ended up arriving on foot after being unable to pass through the taiga's marshland even in an off-road vehicle. Happily, despite the setting and a temperature hovering around 5C, Mrs Matrosova delivered a healthy baby girl. Both of them were carried out of the forest and taken to hospital, where a senior doctor says they're in a "quite satisfactory condition".
