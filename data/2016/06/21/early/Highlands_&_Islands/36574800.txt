 More than £1.7m in funding has been awarded to projects conserving historic properties across Scotland. Dundee Museum of Transport Trust has secured £500,000 to refurbish the city's former Maryfield Tram Depot. Highland Council has won £361,407 in grant aid for work to Inverness Town House. Funding of £360,000 has been awarded to Glasgow's West Boathouse, also £233,855 to Lerwick Town Hall and £65,398 to Greenock's former District Court. The money will come from Historic Environment Scotland's (HES) building repair grants scheme, which supports repair work to buildings of historic or architectural interest.  This is the third round of investment announced since HES came into being in October 2015, following the amalgamation of Historic Scotland and Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. Martin Fairley, head of grants at HES, said: "We received some very strong applications for the latest round of funding, and are pleased to be able to support urgently needed repairs in seven buildings across Scotland.  "The projects chosen to receive funding range in scale from boathouses to town halls, and it's been great to see such a diverse range, with remarkably high levels of community interest."  The full list of funding awards and projects involved in the third round are:
