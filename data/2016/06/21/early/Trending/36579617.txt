 Women are using the hashtag #NoWomanEver to humorously highlight their not-so-funny experiences of wolf whistles, sexual comments from passing strangers and other street harassment. Although the hashtag isn't entirely new it's been used more than 140,000 times in the last couple of days after an American social media user called Miss Black Awareness revived it to sarcastically applaud the actions of a man whose unwanted advances she had seemingly recently suffered. She posted a number of tweets using the hashtag, such as: "He randomly walked next to me down the street for 5 whole minutes. I admired his tenacity and knew he was the man for me" #NoWomanEver" or "I was on my lunch break, and he said 'Oooh, I bet you waaaayyy more delicious than that salad' so I gave him my number" #NoWomanEver".  The baton was soon picked up many others who used #NoWomanEver to recount their treatment by men. All types of stories poured in from women not happy about the way they could be treated in the street. Interestingly, the tweets did not go unnoticed to some men online, who apparently were appalled by such practices and called for more respect to women. Blog by Dmytro Zotsenko
