 A County Fermanagh farmer has been jailed for two months for causing unnecessary suffering to cattle and failure to dispose of animal carcases. Patrick Gerard Donnelly, 61, of Cabra, Irvinestown, pleaded guilty to both charges at Enniskillen Magistrates' Court on Monday. He was jailed for two months on each charge, with the sentences to run concurrently. The case followed an anonymous complaint last year.
