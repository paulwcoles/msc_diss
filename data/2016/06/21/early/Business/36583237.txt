 Are robots replacing us? That's no longer a question, but a reality in many industries.  There will be more than 1.3 million industrial robots in service globally by 2018. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2020, robots will cost 5 million jobs in 15 major economies. The current global leader in industrial robotic automation is South Korea, followed by Japan. But China is catching up, and robots there are increasingly interacting with customers.
