 Baroness Kinnock has paid tribute to murdered MP Jo Cox, who once worked as her assistant. MPs and peers were paying their respects in a series of speeches in Parliament on Monday, to honour the 41-year-old Labour member killed in her home village near Leeds on Thursday.  Baroness Kinnock told the House of Lords that the young graduate, who came to work for her during her time as a Euro-MP, had been destined for great things.
