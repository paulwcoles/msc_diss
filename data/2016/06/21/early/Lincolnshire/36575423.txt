 Firefighters in Lincolnshire have seen the number of calls to assist the ambulance service with obese people more than double in one year. Figures obtained by the BBC show that last year Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Service attended 37 incidents, compared with 16 in 2014 /2015. The service is now carrying out special training sessions for staff with Barry, a specially designed dummy weighing in at 28 stone (178kg).
