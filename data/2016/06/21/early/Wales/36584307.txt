 Rugby star Jamie Roberts says Wales' Euro 2016 success has motivated his side ahead of Saturday's game against New Zealand in Dunedin. Wales stormed to a 3-0 victory over Russia on Monday night to secure their place in the knock out stages of the Euro 2016 competition. Roberts said: "It's fantastic for the country."
