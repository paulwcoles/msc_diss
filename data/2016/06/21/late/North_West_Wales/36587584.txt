 A grandfather from Gwynedd has died after being hit by a boat propeller while swimming off the Maltese island of Gozo.  Allan Stanley, 76, from Nefyn, died on Father's Day - 19 June - two months into a holiday on the island, where he and his wife Diane had a long-term let. The couple ran a homeware shop in Penrhos, near Pwllheli.  He added: "He loved it there [in Malta], he always looked forward to going. He was a keen swimmer, kept very fit for his age, he'd swim a mile or two every day when he was over there." Mr Stanley also had sons Bob and Mitch. A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: "We are providing support to the family of a British national who sadly died in Malta."
