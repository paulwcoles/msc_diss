 Judges at the Appeal Court in Belfast have questioned whether recently published abortion guidelines from the Department of Health need to be examined to establish whether they clarify the law sufficiently.  It is the second day of an appeal against a High Court decision which found that Northern Ireland's abortion law is "incompatible" with human rights legislation.  The Lord Chief Justice asked if a lack of clarity surrounding the law caused a chill factor among doctors. That case was brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. The current abortion legislation differs from the rest of the UK as the Abortion Act 1967 was never extended to Northern Ireland. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk, or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health.  It was due to be set up in February.  Ms O'Neill told MLAs that the terms of reference for the group had been drafted but "have not been formally signed off". She said this meant consequently that the group has not yet met.
