 Several papers produced special editions on Friday morning to reflect the UK's vote to leave the EU. Here is a roundup of what the papers are saying online. "For the first time in 43 years our nation will stand on its own feet, free from the European Union," it says. "For the 48% who voted to remain, and for most of the watching world, Britain has changed in a way that makes the heart sink," he writes. The PM said he would stay for the immediate future but expected his successor to be in place by the Conservative party conference in October, it says. "Now he has lost his big gamble and he has lost his job - but it will be the rest of the country that pays the price," he says. Voters triggered a "political earthquake" by backing Brexit, it adds. "We voted the right way because we're a nation with a sense of destiny. The world is ours now. Go get it," he says. It reports that politicians in Scotland and Northern Ireland - where most voters backed Remain - have demanded "breakaway votes". The paper also says the vote means the start of "the world's most complicated divorce". The Bank said it was "monitoring developments closely" and had done "extensive contingency planning" for the event of a Brexit vote, the paper adds. There is much discussion of why Britain voted for Brexit. It says Boris Johnson has "neatly positioned himself" to become a main player in the leadership race - and points out that he is the bookies' favourite.  The paper lists Stephen Crabb, Theresa May, Nicky Morgan, Sajid Javid and Dominic Raab as possible contenders.
