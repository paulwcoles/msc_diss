 Many of the newspapers are printing special editions to cover the referendum result. The Times in Scotland headlines "Brexit for Britain" over a headline showing a happy Nigel Farage. The Herald sums up the result with a large picture of a tattered Union flag, saying that Scotland's future in the United Kingdom is again on the agenda. The Press and Journal has Boris Johnson giving a thumbs-up and a Union flag design with the headline "We're out". The Scottish Daily Mail has another picture of a smiling UKIP leader and says that "after 42 years the UK is free from the shackles of Europe". On a black front page with a picture of Boris Johnson, the Daily Record tells its readers to "be afraid, be very afraid". The Courier's special edition sums up this morning's news with the headline "We're Out".
