 Watch Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s reaction to Conservative leader David Cameron’s resignation as prime minister, after the UK voted to leave the European Union.  David Cameron says that while leaving Europe was not the path he would have recommended, "I have said before Britain could survive outside the EU." He added that a new leader would be needed “by October”. Corbyn was watching the announcement whilst live on College Green as part of the 5 live Breakfast programme.
