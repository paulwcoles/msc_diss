 Cardiff Central Labour MP Jo Stevens says she has "no truck" with talk of a Labour leadership challenge to Jeremy Corbyn. He is facing a vote of no confidence after some MPs blamed his "lacklustre" campaigning for Remain's defeat in the EU referendum. Mr Corbyn has rejected calls to stand down, vowing to fight to protect workers' rights in Brexit negotiations. Ms Stevens said leadership challenges were "self-indulgent" when the nation's future was at stake.
