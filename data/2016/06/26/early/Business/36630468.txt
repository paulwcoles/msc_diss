 Billionaire investor George Soros has warned that Britain's vote to leave the European Union makes the disintegration of the bloc "practically irreversible". However, he called for thorough reconstruction of the EU in an attempt to save it. Before Thursday's UK referendum, Mr Soros had warned of financial meltdown if Britain voted to leave. In his latest comments, he said the effects of the decision would damage Britain. Mr Soros made huge profits in 1992's "Black Wednesday"  by betting against the British pound as it crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. "Now the catastrophic scenario that many feared has materialised, making the disintegration of the EU practically irreversible," wrote Mr Soros in his latest article. "The financial markets worldwide are likely to remain in turmoil as the long, complicated process of political and economic divorce from the EU is negotiated." He said the consequences for the economy would be comparable to the financial crisis of 2007-2008. "After Brexit, all of us who believe in the values and principles that the EU was designed to uphold must band together to save it by thoroughly reconstructing it," he wrote.  "I am convinced that as the consequences of Brexit unfold in the weeks and months ahead, more and more people will join us." Brexit: What happens now?
