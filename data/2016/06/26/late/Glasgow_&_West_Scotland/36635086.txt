 Seven people have been injured after a rollercoaster crashed off the rails at a theme park in North Lanarkshire. Six ambulances and six fire engines are at the M&D's park near Strathclude Park in Motherwell after being called at 15:37. A number of specialist officers are also at the park, which has been evacuated. An eyewitness said: "People were trapped upside down on the ride." Emergency services said the incident involving the Tsunami ride was ongoing. Eyewiteness Katie Burns said she had just finished riding the Tsunami and was walking past when the carriage crashed with children on board. On Facebook, she said: "Literally got off the Tsunami at M&Ds and then walking past and the next lot of people get on and the full thing goes off the tracks. "Honestly never been so scared in my life, with this weather they should not be on. "Kids and adults are still on it upside down, it's like something out a horror film, children crying and everything. "Literally can't believe this, my heart goes out to everyone on it, a full load came off the track and on the pavement, like a horror film worse thing ever heard and seen, can't get over this."
