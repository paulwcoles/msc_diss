 Two weeks after a  gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, America's LGBT community is still trying to come to terms with what happened.  And for Rizwan Zaman, a gay Muslim man living in the area, the trauma is two-fold.  Amid revelations that the shooter, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to Islamic State during the attack, Mr Zaman feels a growing backlash against the Muslim community.  He spoke to the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan about feeling attacked on two fronts.  Filmed by Matt Danzico. Edited by Bill McKenna. Produced by Suzanne Kianpour.
