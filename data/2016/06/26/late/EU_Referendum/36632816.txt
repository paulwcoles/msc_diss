 The final deal for the UK to leave the European Union may depend on the approval of the UK's parliaments and assemblies, Eurosceptic Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has said. The comments by Mr Davies, who campaigned for a Leave vote, follow a declaration by Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon that the Scottish Parliament could effectively block Brexit, after a majority of Scots voted for Remain. Ms Sturgeon is seeking to ensure that Scotland can remain in the EU, vowing to hold another referendum on independence if necessary. Asked about Brexit on the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales, Labour AM Baroness Morgan warned against pressing ahead too quickly, saying: "I think the European Union will look like a very different place within two years."  Mr Davies said Brexit could ultimately depend on the views of the parliaments and assemblies, and the verdict of the people at the 2020 general election.
