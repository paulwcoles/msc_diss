 A free, aerial acrobatic event showered the centre of Hull with feathers in a "curtain-raiser" for UK City of Culture 2017. Place des Anges, in Queens Gardens Hull on Saturday, involved performers dressed as flying angels and fireworks. Performers glided on wires high above the city's buildings and released 1.5 tonnes of feathers on spectators.
