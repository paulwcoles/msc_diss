 Plans to upgrade one of Tyneside's busiest stretches of road with a triple-decker roundabout have been unveiled. Work at the A19/A1058 Coast Road junction will see the creation of an underpass below the existing roundabout. The scheme, expected to take two years to complete, is due to get under way next month. Highways England said it would reduce congestion and improve journey times. As the main route to and from the Tyne Tunnel, it is used by thousands of motorists every day. Upon completion, project manager Julie Alexander said drivers would no longer have to queue. Narrow lanes and a 30mph (48kph) speed limit will be in place along the A19 and the slip roads during construction work while the speed limit on the A1058 Coast Road will be reduced to 30mph for the duration of the work.
