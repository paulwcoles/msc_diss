 Iraq has suffered its worst day of violence for a year, with nearly 120 people killed in suicide attacks targeting the capital Baghdad.  In one, a truck bomb went off in a busy district, badly damaging a shopping centre, which was packed with families at the time. Around 200 people were injured, with so-called Islamic State claiming responsibility.  Jeremy Bowen reports.
