 A woman has been charged with outraging public decency after photos on social media appeared to show an individual urinating against a war memorial. Photos were shared of a partly-dressed woman squatting over the cenotaph in Grays High Street, Essex, on Friday - the centenary of the Battle of the Somme. Essex Police charged Kelly Martin, 42, of Lucas Road, Grays, on Saturday. She is due to appear before Basildon Magistrates' Court on Monday.
