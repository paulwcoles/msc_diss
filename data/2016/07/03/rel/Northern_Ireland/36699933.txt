 A paramedic has been punched and bitten by a patient inside an ambulance in County Antrim. The patient was being treated for a head injury at the Ballybogey Road near Ballymoney at about 03:30 BST on Sunday when he "lashed out" at medics, the ambulance service said. The injured medic was assessed at the Causeway Hospital in Coleraine and was removed from duty after the attack. That left the Ballycastle area relying on other crews to provide cover. John McPoland of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said the "strongest possible action" should be taken against people found guilty of assaulting its staff.
