 A classic car used by Sir Winston Churchill for campaigning in the 1940s has sold at auction for £232,520. The Daimler DB18 Drophead Coupe is the only surviving example of eight that were built in 1939. It was loaned to the wartime prime minister in 1944 and 1949 for use during political campaigns. Coys auctioneers at Blenheim Palace, where Churchill was born in 1874, said it went to a buyer in the US. Production of the DB18 model started in 1939 but was halted when war broke out.  The factory, in Coventry, was demolished during the Blitz when only eight of the 23 planned cars had been built.  Five of the eight cars were destroyed during the attack and the Chassis 49531 model that was auctioned is the only surviving example. Daimler used it over a 10-year period from 1940 to 1950 for special occasions and it was loaned to Churchill twice. It was fitted with a loudspeaker system, enabling Churchill to sit on the rear deck to address crowds as he was driven through various towns and cities.  German firm Eberhard Thiesen has spent more than £100,000 restoring the vehicle.
