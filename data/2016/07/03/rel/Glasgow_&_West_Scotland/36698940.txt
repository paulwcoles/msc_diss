 Two elderly people have had money stolen from their homes in thefts police believe may have been carried out by the same person. Both incidents happened in Prestwick in Ayrshire on Friday evening. The first involved an 87-year-old woman. A man conned his way into her home in the town at about 18:00 and stole a quantity of cash.  At about 19:30, a 94-year-old partially sighted man was targeted in his house and had money taken. Police described the thefts as "despicable" crimes on "vulnerable members of the community". They said they were keeping "an open mind" but there was a possibility the incidents were linked.  The suspect in the first incident was described as white, about 5ft 8in or 5ft 9in tall, with a heavy build. He had short, fair/light brown hair and spoke with a Scottish accent.  He was wearing a beige jumper and beige trousers.   Det Con Karen Smith said: "Unfortunately, two of our most vulnerable members of the community have been duped by these despicable people.   "I am at a loss as to how anyone can conduct themselves in such a way and feel nothing but contempt for people who carry out such crimes. I am determined to find them and hold them to account for their actions.  "It's possible someone may have seen this man in the company of another, perhaps approaching doors in and around the area.  If you have any information or knowledge about either incidents or the man described, please get in touch as a matter of urgency and help us find these people."
