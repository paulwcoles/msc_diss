 New Zealand police say they have made their biggest ever seizure of cocaine, hidden inside a novel kind of drug mule. They intercepted the $10m (Â£7.6m) worth of cocaine inside a huge diamante-encrusted statue of a horse's head. The shipment of 35kg (77lb) bricks was air-freighted from Mexico to the city of Auckland in May. An American and two Mexicans were arrested over the weekend following a six-week investigation. "This is a significant win for New Zealand," said Det Supt Virginia Le Bas. "We should proud to have detected it at the earliest of stages."
