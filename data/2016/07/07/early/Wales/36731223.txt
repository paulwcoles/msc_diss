 Wales' dream of becoming the first British team in 50 years to reach the final of a major tournament is over after they were knocked out of Euro 2016. Thousands of Welsh fans travelled to France for the historic game in Lyon. Prime Minister David Cameron and Wales' First Minister Carywn Jones were among those to give praise. The team had surpassed the wildest expectations of their fans over four thrilling weeks in the tournament. More than 20,000 supporters were estimated to have travelled to Lyon, with thousands more watching at fan zones around Wales. But two quick goals early in the second half of the semi-final in Lyon from Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani dashed Wales' hopes of reaching the final. Wales started the tournament as 100/1 outsiders but they beat Northern Ireland and Belgium in the knockout stages to reach the last four. Fans in Lyon were quick to praise their team's efforts despite bowing out of the tournament so close to the end. Mark Morgan, of Brecon, Powys, 24, who watched the defeat in the Lyon fan zone, said: "I'm very proud of the team. Why wouldn't you be proud?" "A squad of our players should not be  getting here, let's be honest, but we've done it and I'm very proud," he added. "I've been in tears in four games." Nick True, 40, of Cardiff, said: "I'm a bit gutted but also quite uplifted. "I think we've done well. It's hard to be positive in the face of a defeat but if you look at where we have come from, and how we've managed with the bigger and better teams, it's the team spirit that's done it." Brian Harry, 47, who lives near Mold, Flintshire, said: "It's the first time in my life time that we've been in a tournament.  "We couldn't have done better. I came all the way over here [to Lyon] just for this and I'm just so proud of the boys. They've done Wales proud." Other sports men and women took to Twitter to show their support for the Wales team after the match.
