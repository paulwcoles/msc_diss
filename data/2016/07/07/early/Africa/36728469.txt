 The uncle of Oscar Pistorius has spoken to the BBC's Karen Allen about how the man known as the "blade runner" is preparing for life in prison. The South African Olympic athlete has been sentenced to six years for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013. He was taken immediately to jail. Both the prosecution and defence can appeal, but his lawyers say they will not.
