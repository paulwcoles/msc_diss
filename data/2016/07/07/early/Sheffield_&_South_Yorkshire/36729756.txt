 A man from Sheffield is believed to be amongst the youngest ever winners of England's Strongest Man after claiming the title aged just 21. Paul Smith, who was named the UK's strongest junior in 2015, scooped the title on Sunday lifting weights of more than 170kg (26 stones). He said he hoped to build on his success and go on to contest the UK and World strongest man titles later this year.
