 A 41-year-old man has been arrested in England as part of an ongoing investigation into the supply of Class A drugs to Northern Ireland.  During searches in the Grimsby area, PSNI officers seized an estimated ton of benzocaine, which can be used as a bulking agent for cocaine. They were assisted by detectives from Humberside Police.  Det Insp Pete Mullan, from Reactive and Organised Crime Branch, said the arrest was part of  an ongoing investigation. "The suspect is being brought to Belfast for questioning. "We are determined to tackle the threat posed to communities by illegal drugs and will work with law enforcement partners across the country to apprehend suspected offenders."
