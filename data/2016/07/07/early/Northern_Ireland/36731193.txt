 The family of a Dublin soldier who was shot dead while serving in British army in Iraq say they are still very angry and very sad about what happened to their loved one.   Lance Corporal Ian Malone, from Ballyfermot, was shot in the head by a sniper in April 2003 in Basra.   His sister Carol Malone told BBC NI Dublin Correspondent Shane Harrison the war "could have and should have been avoided".
