 The mother of a soldier killed in the Iraq War says she holds Tony Blair responsible for the murder of her son.  Rose Gentle said she wanted to know why the former Labour prime minister sent her son to Iraq. Fusilier Gordon Gentle was one of 19 UK servicemen killed in the campaign following the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. The long-awaited Chilcot Report found that there had been no imminent threat from Saddam Hussein before the war and that the circumstances, for the UK's military involvement, were far from satisfactory.
