 A huge tunnel boring machine is ready to start work on a new Â£100m storm water tunnel in Glasgow. The three-mile Shieldhall Tunnel will run from Craigton Industrial Estate to Queen's Park in the city. Scottish Water say the work is essential to support continued growth in the city, alleviate flooding and improve water quality in the River Clyde and its tributaries. The 1000 tonne, 590ft (180m) long drill was transported from Germany for the project which is due to complete in 2018.
