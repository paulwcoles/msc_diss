 Revised traffic plans have been put in place at this year's T in the Park festival at Strathallan Castle in Perthshire.  Organisers hope to avoid a repeat of the traffic chaos which marred last year's event as revellers tried to leave. This year there will be separate roads for buses and cars and an improved bus station. Festival-goers will start to arrive at the venue on Thursday for three days of music featuring artists like the Stone Roses, James Morrison and Faithless.  Last year angry music-lovers demanded refunds from organisers, DF Concerts, after being unable to leave the park. They apologised but said problems were compounded by people not following directions and going to the wrong exits.
