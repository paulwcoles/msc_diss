 A man killed a biker on a Perthshire road after overtaking a 4x4 in the opposite lane and striking him "full force", a court heard. James Lambert suffered massive blood loss after he was hit by Graeme McLaughlin's car in the collision on the A822 in July 2014. The former roofing safety advisor admitted causing Mr Lambert's death by careless driving. McLaughlin will be sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow next month. McLaughlin, 30, of East Kilbride, initially faced a charge of causing death by dangerous driving before prosecutors accepted his guilty plea to the reduced charge. The fatal collision occurred between Muthill and Crieff on 11 July, 2014. A court was told Mr Lambert's BMW motorcycle was struck "full force" as McLaughlin overtook a 4x4 in the opposite lane. After his victim landed in a ditch, McLaughlin got out of his vehicle looking "visibly shaken". Mr Lambert's GP happened to be near the crash scene and immediately raced to help. Mr Lambert was taken to hospital, but never recovered after going into cardiac arrest. The court heard that Mr Lambert had escaped with a broken hand after being hurt in a crash on the same road three years earlier.
