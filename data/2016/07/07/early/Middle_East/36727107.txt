 Commentators in Middle East media have responded angrily to the findings of the Chilcot inquiry that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was premature and based on flawed assessments.  But with the report's release coinciding with Eid al-Fitr festivities and most media operating below full capacity, reaction has been muted both in traditional and social media.   Some pan-Arab TV stations such as Al-Jazeera gave the story top billing with numerous breaking news captions, live coverage of Sir John Chilcot's statements and of a protest against former Prime Minister Tony Blair in London.  Iran's state-run rolling news channel IRINN interrupted a news segment to broadcast Prime Minister's Questions live from the House of Commons, and stressed that the report was published after years of delay. How did social media users in the region respond to the report's release? An Arabic hashtag #Chilcot_Report was used on social media where some users lamented what they described as better days, before the "senseless" war.  Calls to punish Tony Blair and former US President George Bush were also expressed.  Arab leaders also come in for some criticism.
