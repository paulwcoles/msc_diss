 More than 100 osprey chicks have been born since the birds were reintroduced to England 20 years ago. It's now hoped the birds will colonise other areas after the success of the breeding programme in Rutland Water. Scottish chicks were introduced to the nature reserve in 1996 and in 2001 a first pair bred. The Rutland Osprey Project observes the "extremely rare" birds from their arrival in spring through to their autumn migration to Africa.
