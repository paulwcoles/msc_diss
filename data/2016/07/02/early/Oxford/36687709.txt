 The only soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) twice during World War One was a solider, an Olympic athlete and a doctor.  Captain Noel Chavasse was born in Oxford and is one of only three men to win the medal twice since it became the highest award for gallantry in 1856. It was his actions in the  Battle of the Somme, where he saved the lives of 20 badly wounded men in three days, that led to him being awarded his first Victoria Cross. Shortly after he died aged 32 in August 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele, he was posthumously awarded a second for bravery. BBC South Today spoke to military historian Jon Cooksey about his life.
