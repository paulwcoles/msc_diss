 A victim of the notorious paedophile Douglas Slade has said his abuser's conviction for a series of attacks on boys has made him a happier person. Slade was one of the men involved in pro-paedophile groups in the 1970s.  He was once described by a national newspaper as one of the vilest men in Britain. Slade has been sentenced to 24 years in jail. One of his victims, "Robert" spoke of how he had been groomed and shared with other men.
