 Royal Troon members have voted "overwhelmingly" at a special meeting to allow women to join. Royal Troon, situated in South Ayrshire, is the host for this year's Open, which runs from 14-17 July. Club captain Martin Cheyne said: "We have said a number of times recently that it is important for golf clubs to reflect the society in which we exist and the modern world that looks to us.  "Therefore, I am delighted with the decision taken by Members of Royal Troon this evening and look forward to welcoming women to our great Club. "It is the right decision for the Club today, and for the generations of golfers that will follow." The vote came just two weeks before the Ayrshire course was due to be the venue for the Open. Mr Cheyne added: "Tonight, we turn our attention to jointly hosting the 145th Open Championship with our great friends at The Ladies Golf Club, Troon.  "We can now all be focused on golf and showcasing this wonderful club and golf course to the huge global audience that this most prestigious Championship commands." The decision has been welcomed by the sport's governing body, the Royal and Ancient. A statement from it said: "We welcome this decision by the membership at Royal Troon and recognise its significance for the club. "Our focus today is very much on The 145th Open in just under two weeks' time but we can now look forward to many more great Championships at Royal Troon in years to come."
