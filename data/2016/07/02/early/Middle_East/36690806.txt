 Two senior military leaders of so-called Islamic State (IS) were killed by a US-led coalition air strike near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, the Pentagon says. They were the group's deputy minister of war, who oversaw Mosul's capture in 2014, and a senior military commander, spokesman Peter Cook said. US-led air strikes have helped Iraqi forces and its allies to push IS back. An offensive to retake Mosul is seen as the next battle for Iraqi forces. Hatim Talib al-Hamduni was a military commander in Mosul and the head of military police in the region, he added. "Their deaths, along with strikes against other ISIL leaders in the past month, have critically degraded ISIL's leadership experience in Mosul and removed two of their most senior military members in northern Iraq," Mr Cook said, using another acronym for IS. They were both killed as a result of a "precision strike" on 25 June, he said. IS launched a sweeping offensive in June 2014, overrunning large areas in northern and western Iraq and eastern Syria, establishing a self-declared "Islamic Caliphate" in the land it captured. Two million people lived there before the group took it over.
