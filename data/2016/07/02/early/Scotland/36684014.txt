 Glasgow Subway will close for four weeks to allow modernisation work to be carried out. The third oldest underground system in the world opened in 1896 and was electrified in 1935. Engineers will replace the 40-year-old ramps and turnouts section which connects the tunnels with the surface depot at Broomloan. SPT have organised a replacement bus service for the duration of the refurbishment which will be carried out between 2 and 31 July.
