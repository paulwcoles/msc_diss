 A two minute silence has marked the centenary of the Battle of the Somme.  A vigil was held at Scotland's National War Memorial to honour the Scots who took part in the offensive.  The silence ended with the sound of a whistle, blown by Alan Hamilton, which was used by his great uncle to signal the start of the first assault, at 07:30 on the morning of 1 July 1916. Other events are taking place across the country to commemorate the fallen.
