 Memorial services have been held across the country and in France to mark 100 years since the start of the Battle of the Somme. Crowds gathered at Aberdeen's Gordon Highlanders Museum, Cavell War Memorial in Inverness and at Edinburgh Castle, among other places. In France, soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland attended a service in the village of Contalmaison to honour the Scots soldiers who fought and died in the Somme.  The Somme was one of the worst assaults in World War One.  More than one million soldiers were killed or injured during fighting that lasted until November 1916.
