 The Jerusalem-born photographer, Muhammed Muheisen, grew up with a camera around his neck and with news all around him.  As AP's chief photographer for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan he has been roaming the region for the past decade, photographing wars and the people caught up in them.  His work has received numerous awards, including the Breaking News Pulitzer Prize in 2005 and 2013, for covering the war in Iraq and the civil war in Syria.  Muhammed Muheisen spoke to BBC World Update's Dan Damon.
