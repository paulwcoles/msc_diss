 Professional footballer Sonwabise Dick comes from one of the toughest suburbs in the South African city of Cape Town, where there are high levels of crime and unemployment. She uses her love of football to motivate young girls, going into primary schools to encourage them to take up sport.  The BBC's Stanley Kwenda went to meet her at the headquarters of Manchester City FC in the UK, where she was attending a leadership course being run by the club as part of an initiative to improve the lives of young people across the world.
