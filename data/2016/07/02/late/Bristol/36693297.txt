 A one-year-old baby boy is in a critical condition after being shot in the head with an air rifle. Police said the Bristol shooting was a "potentially negligent act".  The child was taken to Bristol Children's Hospital with a serious head injury after he was shot at a block of flats in Bishport Avenue, Hartcliffe, just after 16:10 BST on Friday.  A man, 24, and a woman, 23, who are not related to the baby, have been arrested in connection with the incident.  Police, who believe the child received the severe injury from one pellet, say they are not looking for anyone else.  Det Insp Jonathan Deane, from Avon and Somerset Police, said: "We have forensic officers at the scene in Hartcliffe and our focus is very much on unravelling the full circumstances leading up to this tragedy.  "We're not looking for anyone else in connection with what happened and at this time we're treating this as a potentially negligent act." Det Insp Deane added: "Our thoughts are with the child's family and they are being given all the help and support they need.  "I'd like to thank the local community for their patience and understanding while we carry out our inquiries and reassurance patrols will be carried out tonight and tomorrow.   "If any residents have specific concerns then please speak to your neighbourhood team."
