 It's summertime in the US, and people are looking for ways to escape the heat. The National Building Museum in Washington, DC, is offering visitors the chance to immerse themselves in a field of icebergs -  or artistic representations of them, anyway.  This year's instalment of their annual Summer Block Party Series is an about-face from last year's blockbuster exhibit, in which the museum transformed its great hall into a "beach"  - a giant ball-pit installation that represented day at the "ocean". The BBC's Laura Trevelyan went to scope out the cool new exhibit, which opens to the public this weekend. Filmed & edited by Olivia Lace-Evans. Produced by Sarah Svoboda
