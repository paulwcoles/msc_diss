 Chole Bhature - a spicy chickpea curry that is served with a special kind of fried bread, is theatre on a plate.  But if it scores high on spectacle, it also rates very highly for what food scientists call, rather clinically, "mouthfeel" - it is absolutely delicious.  Filmed and edited by Sanjay Ganguly
