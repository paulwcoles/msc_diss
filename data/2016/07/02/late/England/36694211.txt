Firefighters in five appliances from both Kent and Essex were called to the east bore tunnel just before 13:00 BST. Both tunnels had to be closed while the fire was extinguished. There are no reports of any injuries.  She added: "Thought I was going to die." Luca Regan, 14, from Colchester, said: "Everyone started to run and scream out of the tunnel in fear the car was going to explode."
