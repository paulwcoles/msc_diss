 Four people were injured, two of them seriously, after a balcony they were standing on collapsed in Brighton. Fire crews called to a property in Montpelier Road just before midnight found part of the stone balcony and its iron railing missing. Some of those injured had fallen into a basement below. A Sussex Police spokesman said there were no suspicious circumstances. Building control officials have been examining the scene.
