 The Northern Ireland Ambulance service has said it will have to operate a reduced level of cover on Saturday night because of staff shortages. The service said it will have a shortage of 24 staff - 12 ambulance crews - which could lead to delays for "less serious calls". It said it would seek support from voluntary and private ambulance crews. "This will enable NIAS crews to respond to the life-threatening and more serious calls," a spokesman said.   They said the shortage was due to a number of factors, including rostered leave, sickness, vacant shifts and cancelled overtime.   The service said it expects eight crews to be provided by voluntary and private ambulances. "The impact of the shortage will be felt mostly by those patients whose situation is not immediately or potentially life-threatening," the spokesman said.  "We will seek to respond to all calls received but delays may be experienced for those less serious calls."
