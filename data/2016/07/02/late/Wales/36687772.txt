 Labour is in "a major crisis" and has lost touch with its voters, a former Welsh Secretary has warned, following the nationwide vote for the UK to leave the European Union. Lord Hain told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme he had never been as concerned as he was now about the party's prospects.  Jeremy Corbyn has been urged to stand down as Labour leader by most of his MPs, who accuse him of a lacklustre referendum campaign contributing to a victory for Brexit. Lord Hain said Labour could win again if it re-connected with its traditional supporters and had a more "credible leadership".
