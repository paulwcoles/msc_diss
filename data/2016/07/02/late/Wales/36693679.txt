 Hundreds of people have attended two rallies calling for Wales to become an independent country within the EU. Campaign group A Free Wales in Europe/Cymru Rydd yn Ewrop gathered on the Maes in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, and Cardiff on Saturday. Pro-Brexit campaigner David Jones MP said what the campaign group called for was "profoundly undemocratic". Former Plaid Cymru leader Dafydd Wigley, who attended the rally in Caernarfon, said they were "determined Wales' future is going to be as part of Europe".
