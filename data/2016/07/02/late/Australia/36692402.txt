 Barbecues have been fired up at polling booths across Australia for traditional election-day "sausage sizzles". Australians vote on Saturdays and many booths are located at schools, churches and community halls.  These institutions take advantage of the country's high voter turnout by selling sausages, cakes and coffees to waiting voters.  Both the prime minister and opposition leader have been snagged in sausage-related controversies.  Opposition Leader Bill Shorten committed a faux pas when he tried to eat his sausage-and-bun combination from the side, rather than from the end.  Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, meanwhile, skipped the sausage altogether as he voted in Sydney, possibly wanting to avoid a potentially awkward photo opportunity.  "The Australian Electoral Commission has a download of all the polling booth data â€¦ and then I just get schools and anyone holding a polling booth to register on the site, put a description in," he says.  "Since the last election in 2013 we have had a lot of media attention,  so I didn't do too much finding on my own this time." According to the Election Sausage Sizzles site, sausage sizzles and cake stalls are being held at 1,992 polling booths across Australia - just under one-third of the total number.
