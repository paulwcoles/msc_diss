 Shadow cabinet members who are planning to encourage Jeremy Corbyn to resign are attempting to "subvert democracy", a spokesperson for Momentum has said. "If they are unhappy with Jeremy Corbyn's leadership... they need to get 51 signatures, they need to find a candidate and they need to find a platform," said James Schneider, the public face of the grassroots group backing Corbyn. "But they don't have a candidate who could beat Jeremy Corbyn." (Image: Jeremy Corbyn. Credit: AP)
