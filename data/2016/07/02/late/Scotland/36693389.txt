 Her Majesty the Queen has opened the fifth session of the Scottish Parliament a little more than a week after the UK voted to end its membership of the EU. Holyrood's Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh welcomed the Queen to the chamber of the Edinburgh building. In a short address to MSPs, Her Majesty acknowledged the difficulty of "staying calm and collected" in an "increasingly challenging world". BBC Scotland's political editor Brian Taylor reports on the day's events.
