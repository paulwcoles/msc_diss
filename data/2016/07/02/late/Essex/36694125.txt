 A 42-year-old woman was arrested after photos on social media appeared to show her urinating against a war memorial. Photos were shared online of the partly-dressed woman squatting over the cenotaph in Grays High Street, Essex, on Friday, the centenary of the Battle of the Somme. Essex Police said a woman from the town was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of outraging public decency. She is awaiting questioning, the force added.
