 Junior doctors and medical students in England have voted to reject the contract that has been offered to them by the government. British Medical Association members voted 58% to 42% against it. BMA junior doctor leader Dr Johann Malawana, who had urged members to accept the contract, has resigned saying it would be "dishonourable and untenable" for him to continue.
