 Ministers are preparing to impose a contract on junior doctors in England after the profession rejected the deal that had been agreed between union negotiators and the government. Government sources told the BBC they were "minded" to impose the deal. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said a "rapid decision" was needed over whether or not to impose the contracts.
