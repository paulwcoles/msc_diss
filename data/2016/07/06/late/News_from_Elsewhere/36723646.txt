 South Korea's government has launched a new campaign encouraging businesses to help their staff find a better balance between work and home life. Senior managers are being encouraged to support the campaign, which is being jointly run with private sector groups. Koh Young-sun, vice minister of gender equality and family, says the public and private sectors need to work together to "fundamentally change" the country's working culture.  There will be a push for more positive language to be used with staff who have family commitments, and the government wants an end to employees being pressured into working overtime or attending after-work dinners, too.
