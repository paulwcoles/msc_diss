 Waste from water-less toilets in slums in Kenyaâ€™s capital, Nairobi, is being processed into fertiliser and used to help produce animal feed. More than a third of the global population lacks adequate sanitation, a problem that is even more pronounced in informal urban settlements. The Sanergy Toilets initiative in Kenya is not only a money-spinner but it looks after the environment. Operators of the toilets charge $0.01 per use - tissue is provided, as well as soap and water to wash your hands. Video journalist: Roderick MaCleod
