 Twenty hostages were killed in Friday's attack on a Dhaka cafe, including 18 foreigners, who were singled out.  The so-called Islamic State group claimed it was behind the attack, but Bangladesh's government has denied it. Nine of the victims were Italian, some of whom frequented the Holey Artisan Bakery.  Antonio, an Italian-British professional, was a regular at the cafe and knew three of them.  He spoke to Mahfuz Sadique about the impact the attack has had on foreigners living in the city.
