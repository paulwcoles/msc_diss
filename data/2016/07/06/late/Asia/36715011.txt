 A migrant worker who survived a Taiwanese missile hitting his fishing boat says he feels "lucky to be alive".  Taiwan's navy mistakenly fired the anti-ship missile during a practice drill against China on Friday.  The captain was killed, but three crew members survived, partly because the missile failed to explode when it hit the vessel in waters off the island.  Bui Trong Van spoke to the BBC's Cindy Sui.
