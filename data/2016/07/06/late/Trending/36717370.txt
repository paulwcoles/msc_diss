 Lagos, the largest city of Nigeria, is known, among other things, for its thriving and chaotic street trade. Road side vendors of all types have been among the icons of the African city.  So the recent announcement by the Governor of Lagos state, Akinwunmi Ambode that he intended to arrest and jail street hawkers has been met with anger and disbelief. The crackdown on illegal street hawkers is actually not the result of a new legislative initiative. The governor has just decided to enforce the Lagos State Street Trading and Illegal Market Prohibition Law 2003. The motivation seems to be reduce traffic congestion supposedly caused by street hawkers interacting with drivers. However, his campaign has been perceived by some as an unfair attack on the many citizens of Lagos who make their living via selling petty goods in the streets.  The hashtag #LagosHawkersPolicy was started and has since been used more than 3,000 times. Some argued, that the governor was determined to make the "poor poorer". Others insisted that street trade was the only way for some Nigerians to make a living, and that many families relied on hawking as the sole source of income. Some on social media pointed out that when campaigning for his post in January 2015, Akinwunmi Ambode had a different opinion on street vendors. People dug out photos taken during his election campaign, where he is apparently pictured buying boli, a local snack, from a street stall in Lagos State.  People went on to accuse the now governor of hypocrisy, pointing out that the election does change people after all. Blog by Dmytro Zotsenko
