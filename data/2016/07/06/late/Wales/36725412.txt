 The father of a soldier who died in Iraq had told the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war and its aftermath his son "died in vain". Reg Keys' son, L/Cpl Thomas Keys, from Llanuwchllyn near Bala in Gwynedd, was 20-years-old when he was killed in an Iraqi police station in 2003 while serving with the Royal Military Police along with five of his colleagues. Mr Keys later stood against former prime minister Tony Blair in the general election. He was present with other bereaved families at the unveiling of the report by Sir John Chilcot on Wednesday.
