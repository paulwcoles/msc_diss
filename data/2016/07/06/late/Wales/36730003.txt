 Thousands of Wales fans are in France for the biggest football match in the nation's history. Wales will appear in their first semi-final of a major tournament when they play Portugal in Lyon at 20:00 BST. The winners of that game will face either France or Germany in Sunday's Euro 2016 final. Fan zones have been set up around Wales, including at Cardiff's Principality Stadium which will hold 27,500 fans who obtained tickets. As supporters gathered in the streets of Lyon, BBC Wales asked some to try speaking key football phrases in Welsh.
