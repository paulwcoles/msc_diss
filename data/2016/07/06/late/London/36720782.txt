 About 1,000 passengers have been evacuated from a train and led through London underground tunnels to safety. Passengers walked along the dark tracks for more than five minutes after the train got stuck near Shepherd's Bush station. Helpful Transport for London staff can be seen leading the passengers back to the station. TfL said the evacuation was a "safe, routine operation". Video shot by Peter Chipping
