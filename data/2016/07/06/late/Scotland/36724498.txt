 Alex Salmond has said access to the Chilcot Report is a further injustice to the families of the 179 service personnel who died following the UK's decision to join in the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. The SNP's foreign affairs spokesman in Westminster said that while families have had sight of the report for the first time on Wednesday morning, former prime minister Tony Blair has seen the report for months. Sir John Chilcot's 12-volume report has examined the run-up to the invasion of Iraq and its aftermath. Mr Salmond said he had worked out that to read the entire 2.5 million-word report in the allocated time, would require a reading speed of 14,000 words per minute.
