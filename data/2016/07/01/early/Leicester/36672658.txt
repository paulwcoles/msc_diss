 A film portraying the last two weeks of the life of murdered schoolgirl Kayleigh Haywood is set to be shown in schools. Leicestershire Police, who made the five minute film, said it provided a "stark warning" about the dangers of online grooming. Screenings will take place at schools in Leicestershire before being released to other police forces across the UK.
