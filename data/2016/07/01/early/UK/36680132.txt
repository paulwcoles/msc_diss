 The Queen has led events to mark 100 years since the Battle of the Somme, as overnight vigils got under way on the eve of the anniversary. The 38th Welsh Division, a volunteer force, suffered some of the heaviest losses in those first days of July 1916 when they were ordered to drive German forces out of Mametz Wood. Some of the men who took part described their experiences in BBC interviews recorded in the 1980s, as Huw Edwards reports.
