 An organised crime gang which terrorised people in Wrexham has been sentenced. Mold Crown Court heard the 11 members had admitted a string of charges including supplying drugs, handling firearms and handling stolen goods. The gang's ringleader William Smith, 44, of Wrexham, was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Judge Geraint Walters said they "formed part of an underworld that operated beneath the radar". He said: "This team was prepared to inflict serious damage on both property and also to inflict serious bodily harm... they were prepared to inflict serious violence with the use of weapons." "This team presented a serious threat to law and order in the area in which they operated," he added. Det Insp Arwyn Jones of North Wales Police said: "This has been a protracted, complex and sometimes distressing investigation into the activities of an organised crime group and the violence, fear and misery they have inflicted. "This criminal gang contained a number of violent individuals who would use and threaten violence as part of their criminality." Sentences:
