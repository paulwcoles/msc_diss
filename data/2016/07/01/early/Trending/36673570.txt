 In this week of seismic political change in Europe, a deadly terror attack in Turkey and troubling protests by police officers in Rio, social media has not been finding much funny. However, a viral hashtag has been providing some respite. And it's all to do with Shakespeare. The hashtag #RuinShakespeare invited people to adapt the great playwright's works to contemporary times and, well, mess it up, and the internet happily delivered. There were plenty of references to Millennial behaviour. And those stalwarts of popular culture, the Kardashians. And the iconic Lionel Richie 'Hello' music video (a.k.a your dad's favourite song) also got a shout-out. The references were also timely. Remember that it's the summer festival season. And political figures were very much on people's minds. US Presidential hopeful Donald Trump's hair came under the spotlight.
