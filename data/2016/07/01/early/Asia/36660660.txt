 Disney's upcoming film Moana is based on Polynesian mythology with a strong female lead, Princess Moana. Maui, a character based on a legendary figure at the heart of Pacific Island culture, is one of her companions in her journey. But some, including rugby player Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu, have found the rather overweight depiction of Maui to be offensive. Disney did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.
