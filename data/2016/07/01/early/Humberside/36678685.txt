 A large blaze broke out in a chemical complex at an industrial estate in East Yorkshire. The blaze began at an aerosol manufacturer at Pocklington shortly before 17:00 BST. Humberside Fire and Rescue Service said the fire followed a large explosion of chemicals at the factory. No-one was injured in the blaze and fire crews will remain at the site overnight to carry on damping down. One eyewitness told the BBC: "Things just started exploding and the building was shaking. "We could feel the heat and it was just 'get out of the building now'." Neighbouring businesses were evacuated and residents in Pocklington and the surrounding villages were advised to stay indoors and keep windows closed. There was also significant congestion on roads in the area including the A1079 York to Hull route. John Galley, who works nearby, said: "The flames at its height it were easily 50 feet in the air with a very significant pall of black smoke reaching way into the sky." Yorkshire Water had warned local residents of a risk of low water pressure due to the fire service using hydrants in the area.
