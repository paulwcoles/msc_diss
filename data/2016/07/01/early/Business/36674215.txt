 A total of 555,000 people have opened Help-to-Buy Individual Savings Accounts (HTB Isas) since they launched in December, government figures show. The accounts enable first-time buyers to save money free of tax and qualify for a government bonus at the same time. If the proceeds are used to buy a home, the government adds 25% to the total. The figures also show that 2,090 bonuses were paid under the scheme up until the end of May. The average value of the bonuses was Â£421. Savers used their money to buy 1,490 properties, with the highest interest coming from homebuyers in the North West and Yorkshire. How does a Help to Buy Isa work? "For the time being, HTB Isa is a no-brainer for those saving toward their first home, even if ultimately their savings are used for a different purpose," said Danny Cox of investment provider Hargreaves Lansdown. "However, from April 2017, the Lifetime Isa (Lisa) will become the savings scheme of choice."
