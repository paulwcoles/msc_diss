 Veteran Labour backbencher Paul Flynn has won temporary promotion to his party's front bench amid continuing turmoil over Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. The Newport West MP led for Labour at business questions in the Commons on Thursday following the resignation of fellow Welsh MP Chris Bryant as shadow leader of the house on Sunday. Known as a serial rebel, Mr Flynn made light of his unexpected appearance at the despatch box, joking that it was part of a "diversity project" to promote "octogenarians".
