 Malawi's president has sparked anger by saying people should eat mice to cope with a nationwide food crisis - but one minister says he wasn't being serious. But the country's information minister says she doesn't understand the backlash, as President Mutharika was simply cracking a joke. "The president has a right to joke when he is interacting with his people," Patricia Kaliati told the state-owned Malawi Broadcasting Corporation. "He does not have to fear to explore his sense of humour simply because fault-finders lie in wait to denounce anything that he says."
