 The parents of a Cardiff boy who died after heart surgery are digesting the details of a review into cardiac deaths at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children.  Luke Jenkins, seven, suffered brain damage caused by cardiac arrest, a week after surgery in March 2012. He had been expected to make a full recovery. There have been four separate investigations by the hospital into Luke's death while the coroner concluded at his inquest that there had been no gross failure by the hospital and that Luke's death was neither predictable nor preventable. Robert Woolley, chief executive of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation, said as the latest report was published they wanted to "say sorry, particularly to those parents where the review has found our care fell below acceptable standards". Luke had a congenital heart condition and had undergone three major heart operations since he was a baby. His parents Stephen and Faye spoke to BBC Wales health correspondent Owain Clarke and described the bubbly boy, who was so used to hospitals he wanted to become a doctor.
