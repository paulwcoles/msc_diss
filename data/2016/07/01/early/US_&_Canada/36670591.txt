 A British man who allegedly snatched a police officer's gun at a rally for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in Las Vegas has been charged in the US. Michael Sandford, 20, face charges of disrupting an official function and illegal firearm possession. If found guilty, he faces up to 10 years in prison. Mr Sandford was initially charged last week with an act of violence in a restricted area, at the Treasure Island casino hotel in Las Vegas, where Mr Trump was speaking. He told the secret service that he had driven there from California in order to kill Mr Trump, and had been to a gun range the day before to practice shooting, according to the court documents. He also said he expected to die in the attempt, which he had been planning for a year. Mr Sandford's father Paul Davey, from Havant, said his son had "always been a polite and peaceful boy".  "It's so against his nature and obviously with his Aspergers [a form of autism], we think somebody has got hold of him and done something," he said.

His lawyer, Heather Fraley, said Mr Sandford previously attempted suicide and once ran away from a hospital in England.
