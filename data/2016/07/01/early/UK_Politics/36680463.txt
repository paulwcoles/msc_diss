 Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell is to set out Labour's response to the EU referendum in a speech in London. It comes as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - of whom Mr McDonnell is a key ally - continues to resist calls within his own party to resign. There have been dozens of resignations from the shadow front bench in an attempt to see Mr Corbyn step down. It follows criticism of Mr Corbyn's performance during the referendum campaign. Some 60,000 people have joined the Labour Party in the last week, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason quotes sources as saying. But it is unclear whether they would support Mr Corbyn in a leadership vote or oppose him, our correspondent added. Ms Eagle looks had been expected to launch a bid for the Labour leadership but a source close to her told the BBC she was waiting to give Mr Corbyn time to "do the right thing" and step down. Labour MPs voted earlier this week against Mr Corbyn by 172 to 40 in a motion of no confidence.  Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn has been accused by Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis of making "offensive" comments at the launch of a Labour party probe into anti-Semitism. The Labour leader said in a speech that Jews were "no more responsible" for Israel's actions than Muslims were for "those various self-styled Islamic states". Mr Corbyn later denied he was comparing Israel and so-called Islamic State. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry later phoned the Israeli Ambassador in London to apologise for any offence caused by Mr Corbyn's remarks. A source close to Ms Thornberry said Ambassador Mark Regev "had no issue with the speech."
