 The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to the Welsh National Opera on its 70th anniversary. A special concert was staged at Buckingham Palace on Thursday. Since its inception in 1946, WNO has provided a stage to some of the world's biggest opera stars. Two of them - Bryn Terfel and Rebecca Evans - were at the palace to perform in front of Prince Charles alongside the orchestra and chorus of WNO. Terfel told BBC Wales arts and media correspondent Huw Thomas that the opera company had "created wings" for singers.
