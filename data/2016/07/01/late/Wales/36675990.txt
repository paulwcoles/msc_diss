An overnight vigil concluded with a public service at the National War Memorial in Cardiff at 07:00. On Friday morning, Swansea's Morrison Orpheus Choir will sing at a memorial event at Thiepval in northern France. Around Wales, churches will be hosting community events.  At the Llangollen War Memorial in Denbighshire, a whistle will be blown at 07:30, followed by a remembrance event at 10:50. Events will continue through the day, with St Mary's Church, Welshpool, Powys, holding a service at 18:00.
