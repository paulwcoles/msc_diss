 Hundreds of Wales fans heading to the Euro 2016 quarter final fear they could miss the game after Eurotunnel delays. Eurotunnel LeShuttle tweeted that commuters faced a three-and-a-half hour wait, although three extra trains were being put on to try to reduce delays. On Friday morning, fans reported waiting five hours and expressed concerns for those travelling later. Wales face Belgium in Lille at 20:00 BST with some fans calling for the start to be delayed. Fan Huw Foulkes sent this video of the situation at the terminal in Folkestone, Kent, on Friday afternoon.
