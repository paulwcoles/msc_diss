 Almost one in ten of the soldiers who died on the first day of the Somme were from the 36th Ulster Division. Members of their families will be among those attended a ceremony at the Ulster Memorial Tower in Thiepval. It was built close to the front line of the attack which took place 100 years ago today.  BBC Ireland Correspondent Chris Buckler visited the site.
