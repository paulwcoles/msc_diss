 Muslim clerics have criticised Bollywood actor Irrfan Khan over comments he made about the practice of animal sacrifice in Islam. Khan on Thursday said that "we perform these rituals without knowing the meaning behind them". Clerics advised the Muslim actor to "concentrate on his film career" and refrain from "making random statements about our religion". The actor is known for his roles in The Life of Pi and Slumdog Millionaire.  Many Muslims over the world sacrifice animals to mark Eid al-Adha, one of the two most important Islamic festivals. The actor also commented on fasting observed by Muslims during the holy month of Ramadan. "Rather than fasting during Ramadan, people should self-introspect. Animals are being slaughtered  in the name of qurbaani during Muharram [a Shia religious event]. We, Muslims, have made a mockery of Muharram. It is meant for mourning and what we do? Take out processions," he said. Sher Qazi Khalid Usmani, another cleric, said the the actor "should keep his mouth shut as he has no knowledge about the religion".
