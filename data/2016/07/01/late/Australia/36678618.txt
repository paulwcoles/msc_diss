 Australia goes to the polls this weekend in an election that pits the current Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his conservative coalition against a Labor opposition led by Bill Shorten.  Outsiders could be forgiven for losing track of who runs the country.  If Mr Shorten were to win he would be the sixth prime minister in six years, counting two stints for Kevin Rudd.
