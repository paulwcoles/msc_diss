 John Wilson, BBC Front Row presenter, captured the scene at King's Cross station this morning, calling the appearance of the soldiers an "incredibly moving tribute". The uniformed men have been handing out cards to people who ask them what is happening. Each card details a soldier killed on the first day of the battle.
