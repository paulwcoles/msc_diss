 Boris Johnson has been quizzed by reporters as he left his home in London this morning. The Leave campaigner, who shocked Westminster on Thursday by pulling out of the Tory leadership race, said: "It's going to be up to someone else now." Asked what he thought of his fellow Leave campaigner Michael Gove's decision to run instead, Mr Johnson added: "I wish him every possible success."
