 The Queen will officially open the new session of the Scottish Parliament on Saturday. About 2,500 people will join the dignitaries and politicians at Holyrood. Formal pomp and ceremony inside the Parliament will complement a procession along the Royal Mile as the Parliament opens its doors to the people. BBC Scotland's Craig Anderson has been to see the final preparations being put in place.
