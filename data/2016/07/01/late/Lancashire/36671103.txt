 Private Will Marshall, the last survivor of the Accrington Pals, gave a vivid account of going over the top at the Battle of the Somme. His memories were recorded in an interview for the North West Sound Archive. Pte Marshall, from Burnley in Lancashire, died in 1995, one month short of his 102nd birthday and spoke of how his colleagues were killed within seconds and he was left alone and wounded on the battlefield.
