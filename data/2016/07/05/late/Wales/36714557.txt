 Wales' players have been asked not to bring their children onto the pitch after Wednesday's Euro 2016 semi-final because it is "not a safe place". Fans have been delighted by images of players including Gareth Bale, Hal Robson-Kanu and Ashley Williams celebrating with their children in their victorious run to the last four. However Uefa said: "It is a European Championship, not a family party." Wales, who beat Belgium 3-1 in the quarter-final, face Portugal in Lyon. Tournament director Martin Kallan said: "A stadium is not the most safe place for small kids if fans invaded the field, and with stadium staff operating machinery on the playing surface." A Uefa official said: "It is nice pictures. We are not 100% against it but we are cautious."
