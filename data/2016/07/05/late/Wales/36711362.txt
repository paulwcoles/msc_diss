 Archive recordings of the late tenor Luciano Pavarotti making his first appearance at Llangollen International Eisteddfod have been unearthed as the 70th anniversary event begins. The opening concert for the festival is taking place on Tuesday night, with competitions set to start on Wednesday. Pavarotti first appeared with a choir from his home town of Modena, Italy, in 1955, and won first prize. He said the experience inspired him to launch his singing career. This recording from the 1955 performance was a 19-year-old Pavarotti with the Chorus Rossini.
