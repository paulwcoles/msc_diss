 Wales' football team have been given the royal seal of approval from Prince Charles who wished them well in their Euro 2016 semi-final game against Portugal. Asked if he had a message for Chris Coleman's men, he said: "Huge good luck is all I can say. I'm sure they have got a very good chance of beating Portugal. Everyone will be keeping their fingers crossed." The prince was speaking during a visit to a clogmaker in Criccieth, Gwynedd, as part of his annual visit to Wales. Wales play Portugal in Lyon on Wednesday for a place in the tournament final on Sunday.
