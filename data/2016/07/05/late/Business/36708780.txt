 The former owner of BHS, Dominic Chappell, has defended the money he took out of the company as a "drip in the ocean". He was speaking to BBC Newsnight's Adam Parsons in his first interview since the collapse of BHS. Mr Chappell bought BHS in 2015 for £1. He took a total of £2.6m out of the company, including a £600,000 salary. The business collapsed this year with the loss of up to 11,000 jobs and a big hole in the pension fund.
