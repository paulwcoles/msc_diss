 The first minister and the Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, have held separate talks with business leaders about the aftermath of the EU referendum. Nicola Sturgeon has branded as "inhumane" the UK government's failure to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in Scotland to remain following the Brexit vote.  Mr Mundell has said the UK and Scottish governments must work more closely together to secure the best outcome of the Brexit negotiations and says he will make sure Scottish interests are at the heart of the negotiation process.
