 The original Declaration of Arbroath has been given special status by the United Nations. The letter written in 1320, voices support for King Robert Bruce and an independent Scotland, and is still regarded as a statement of a nation's claim to freedom.  Its addition on the Unesco "Memory of the World Register" recognises its cultural importance and offers protection to the document which was last on public display 11 years ago.
