 Bakers in Tonga are appealing for help from the king after the government banned them from selling bread on Sundays. Baker Kennedy Penitani tells the programme that his fellow bread makers are preparing a petition to give to King Tupou VI in protest at the government's move. He says it's the first time in 34 years that his bakery didn't open on a Sunday, and the change means he may have to lay-off staff. Bakers have been allowed to open on Sundays since 1982, when a cyclone struck Tonga and there was an immediate need to feed the population. "I thought it would be allowed for three years then stop it again but they saw the benefit and how it is good for feeding the people," Mr Cowley says. "We thought they would allow it forever."
