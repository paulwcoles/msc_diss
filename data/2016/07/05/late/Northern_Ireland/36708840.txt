 A playpark in east Belfast is to be moved in order to facilitate a bonfire.  As part of community development in the area, a new playground was erected where the bonfire previously stood. But plans are in place to remove play apparatus, including swings and climbing frames, from the park to protect it from heat.  Mervyn Jess reports.
