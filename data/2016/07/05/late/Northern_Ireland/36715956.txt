 The Education Authority (EA) has been accused of misleading a Northern Ireland Assembly committee for the second time in three months. The complaint, from Alliance Party MLA Chris Lyttle, relates to evidence the EA gave about a Belfast special school. However, in a statement to the BBC, the authority says it is "satisfied" the information provided on 15 June about Fleming Fulton School was "accurate".   BBC News NI Education Correspondent Robbie Meredith reports.
