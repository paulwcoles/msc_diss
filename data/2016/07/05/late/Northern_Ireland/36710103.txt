 A man from Northern Ireland has been found dead in a guesthouse in Phnom Penh, police in Cambodia have said. They say 34-year-old Martin Stephen Hale, from Lisburn, County Antrim, was found dead in his room. It is understood a second man from Northern Ireland was taken to hospital. He later discharged himself and went missing, but has since been found after a social media appeal from friends and family. His family expect him to return to Northern Ireland at the end of the week. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said it was "providing support" to the families of the two men. The Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust is working with the Hale family.
