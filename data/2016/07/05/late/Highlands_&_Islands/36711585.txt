 A former Highland care home manager has been cleared of misconduct allegations by a Nursing and Midwifery Council panel. John Charters was assistant manager at Grandview House in Grantown on Spey when it was alleged he failed in his care of residents at the site. Following a hearing, the panel determined that his fitness to practice had not been impaired. The panel determined that almost 30 facts in the case could not be proved. In its newly released outcome, it said the facts that could be proved did not amount to misconduct. These included an allegation that Mr Charters refused to see a resident when asked to do so, but the panel said that he had been complying with a managerial measure put in place by his employer for the benefit of the resident and Mr Charters's own protection. The panel, which held its hearing in Edinburgh, heard allegations related to dates in November 2013 and July 2014.
