 A 63-year-old man has been charged by police in connection with a report of homophobic abuse on a bus on Leith Walk. Police Scotland said the incident happened on Saturday. The man is due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court at a later date. Insp David Robertson said: "We will not tolerate hate crime in any form and I can reassure the public that all reports passed to us will be thoroughly investigated."  He added: "Edinburgh has diverse communities and there is no place for intolerance. I urge victims to always report hate crime so that we can tackle this unacceptable behaviour when it occurs. "Likewise, anyone who has witnessed such incidents should contact us immediately on 101."
