 Long before Lebron, there was the Babe. Babe Ruth, that is. The baseball slugger was America's first superstar athlete, and a new exhibit at Washington's National Portrait Gallery features 40 artefacts and photos from his extraordinary life.  The BBC's Jane O'Brien stepped into the batter's box, and has this report.  Filmed by Franz Strasser. Edited by Bill McKenna.
