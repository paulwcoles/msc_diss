 Sir Jackie Stewart has told BBC Radio 5 live that treating his wifeâ€™s dementia is 'the biggest challenge of his life'. Lady Helen, 75, was diagnosed with the disease two years ago.  Her husband is now launching a charity called Race Against Dementia to put right what he sees as a grave lack of research funding.  "It's the biggest thing I've taken on, that's for sure. When I was a racing driver, God gave me a gift to drive cars. That was easy compared to what I'm challenged to here."
