 A footballer who went to help a friend in a broken-down car has had both his legs amputated after a hit-and-run driver crashed into their vehicles. Shaun Whiter went to help Joey Abbs with a flat tyre in Newmarket on Friday night. Both men were pinned against their cars when the vehicle hit them. Mr Whiter, 27, who was due to begin training with Newmarket Town FC, has lost both legs below the knee. Mr Abbs, who plays for Soham, sustained a "serious" leg injury. The Newmarket player is due to marry his fiancee Charlotte Way next July and has vowed to "walk down the aisle". More News from Suffolk The crash happened on Dullingham Road, in the Suffolk town at 22:55 BST. Mr Whiter came to his aid, parking his black BMW 320 behind. A Ford Focus then crashed into Mr Whiter, who was standing behind his vehicle. The force shunted the BMW forward, pinning Mr Abbs between the two cars. The Ford Focus driver did not stop at the scene, Cambridgeshire Police said.  The force described Mr Abbs' injuries as "serious".

We are in shock, absolutely devastated," he told the BBC. Both Newmarket FC and Cambridgeshire club Soham Town Rangers have tweeted their support for the players, describing them as "great guys".
