 Officials at Uefa have been branded "killjoys" by a Plaid Cymru AM who criticised them for saying Wales' football players should not take their children on the pitch after matches. Simon Thomas said he could not think of a more positive message "than to have young girls and boys kicking the ball around at the end of an international football match". Earlier on Tuesday, Uefa said: "It is a European Championship, not a family party." Wales, who beat Belgium 3-1 in the quarter-final, face Portugal in Lyon on Wednesday.
