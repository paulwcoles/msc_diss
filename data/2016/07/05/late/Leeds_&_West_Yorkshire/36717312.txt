 The father of a soldier who died at the start of the Iraq War is hoping the Chilcot report will provide evidence of wrong-doing by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair. Peter Brierley has contested Mr Blair's reasons for going to war. Mr Brierley's son Shaun was killed in a vehicle crash in Kuwait just after the war started. The Chilcot report on the Iraq War is being published on Wednesday.
