 At least 165 people were killed shortly after midnight on Sunday when a suicide bomber blew up an explosives-laden lorry in the centre of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, security sources say. The jihadist group Islamic State (IS) has said it was behind the attack, which targeted a crowded shopping centre in the Karrada district, where people were enjoying a night out after breaking their daily fast for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Over the past two years, Mr Hollander and his Battery Dance company had mentored Jaf online. "Though he said he was a hip-hop and break-dancer, he said he really wanted to expand his repertoire," Mr Hollander said. "He wanted to learn from us and learn about contemporary dance and do ballet."
