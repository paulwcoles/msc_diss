 More than 12,000 people have taken part in the Olympic torch relay in Brazil as the country prepares to host the sporting event.  Success on social media app Snapchat helped 24-year-old lawyer Thaynara Oliveira Gomes get selected to carry the torch. She found fame on Snapchat as 'Thaynara OG' and is using her popularity to put the spotlight on her home state of Maranhao in Brazil's neglected northeast. Julia Carneiro went to meet her in her home town of Sao Luis. Filmed and edited by Ana Terra Athayde, Produced by Luciani Gomes
