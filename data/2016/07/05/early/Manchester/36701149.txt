 A woman was killed when she was hit by a lorry on the motorway as she got out of her car to inspect the damage after hitting the central reservation. Special Constable Samantha Derbyshire, 23, had been involved in a "minor collision" on the M61 moments before.  Her car had been left immovable and it is thought she had got out "to check the damage" when she was struck, at about 03:30 BST near junction five. In a tribute, her family said she was "fun loving, beautiful and amazing". "She was also such a funny, clever and amazing friend but also a fantastic, enthusiastic special constable which she worked so hard to achieve," they said in a statement. "She was so proud of this and loved it." Ms Derbyshire, who had been off duty at the time, died at the scene. The motorway was closed northbound while investigations were carried out. Drivers were diverted from junction four, causing tailbacks during the rush hour, before the carriageway was reopened. Ms Derbyshire was due to join Greater Manchester Police as a constable after passing her entry tests. "We as a family are devastated by what has happened to Sam and couldn't be any more proud of her," her family said.  "She was better than all of us and lived her life to the full every day." Safety guidelines from Highways England advise drivers not to leave their vehicles in the event of being stuck in a "live" lane.
