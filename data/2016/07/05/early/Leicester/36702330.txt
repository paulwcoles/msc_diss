 A taxi driver refused to pick up a blind man with a guide dog because he said it was "against his religion". Charles Bloch, who has glaucoma and is partially sighted, said this was the second time he had been refused a taxi within six months because of his guide dog. The taxi company in Leicester, ADT, has apologised and said it had dismissed the driver who had been self employed.
