 A university in China has responded to complaints about a lack of air conditioning in student residences by ordering huge chunks of ice to cool people down. Images from the campus show students breaking off chunks of the large ice blocks and filling buckets to take back to their dormitories. One man tells the China News Service he'll use it to keep drinks cool in his residence, but on social media most users think the university just needs to sort out some air conditioning. A university official tells the paper that air conditioners can't be installed yet because the local power grid doesn't have enough capacity to cope with the extra demand, so the ice is an interim solution.
