 A bench hand-crafted from a single piece of Clashach sandstone from a quarry in Moray is to be presented to the Queen to mark her 90th birthday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will present the gift on behalf of the people of Scotland during Royal Week in Scotland. The stone has carvings of a rose, the Lion Rampant and stags' heads. Edinburgh-based architect David Storrar and apprentice stonemasons in Elgin were involved in making the bench. The timber seating slats were made from elm timber from the Queen's garden at The Palace of Holyroodhouse and carved by joiners in Edinburgh.
