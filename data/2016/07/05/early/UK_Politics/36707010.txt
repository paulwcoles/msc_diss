 You might have noticed your social media timeline full of pictures like this. The writer Will Black started the hashtag #SuggestAJobForFarage after Nigel Farage stepped down as UKIP leader on Monday morning.  So it was probably inevitable that the Top Gear presenter's vacancy was among the job opportunities suggested on social media for Mr Farage. Others thought another political figure should be considered for the post, although Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is not considering any new career opportunities. As social media bets were placed on who should take up Evans's now vacant post, some Twitter users suggested Boris Johnson as a possible replacement. Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow threw his hat into the ring.  And there were some rank outsiders for the position. Produced by Rozina Sini, BBC's UGC and Social News team
