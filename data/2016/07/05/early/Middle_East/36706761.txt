 A suicide bomber has killed four security officers and injured five others near one of Islam's holiest sites in the Saudi city of Medina, according to the interior ministry. The bomber detonated his explosives after being stopped outside the Prophet's Mosque, a statement said.

That an attack happened in Medina at such a place is likely to leave Muslims around the world aghast, BBC World Service's Middle East editor, Alan Johnston, says. Suspicion is likely to fall on so-called Islamic State (IS), he adds. Qari Ziyaad Patel, 36, from South Africa, who was in the mosque, told the Associated Press news agency people had at first thought it was the sound of the cannon fire that marks the breaking of fast. The ground shook, he said, adding: "The vibrations were very strong. It sounded like a building imploded." Earlier, at least one explosion rocked Qatif, an eastern city which is home to many minority Shia Muslims. The blast appeared to target a Shia mosque. The attacker was killed but no other casualties were reported. No-one has yet said they were behind any of the attacks.

In June, the interior ministry said there had been 26 "terror attacks" in the kingdom in that time. A series of deadly attacks worldwide were either claimed by, or blamed on, IS over the past week:
