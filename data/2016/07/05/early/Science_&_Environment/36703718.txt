 Sky at Night presenter Dr Chris Lintott explains why he's looking forward to the Juno mission's arrival at Jupiter. The Nasa spacecraft will aim to discover how the planet formed as well as whether the planet has a solid core. It should be captured by the gas giant's gravity early on Tuesday (GMT) to go into orbit.
