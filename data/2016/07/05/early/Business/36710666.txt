 Silver, long considered the poorer cousin of gold, is trading at its highest price in more than two years as investors put their money into precious metals, perceived as lower risk assets. Spot silver rose by as much as 7% in US trading to above $21 an ounce. It has risen 11.5% in the past three days. Gold added more than 1% to settle at $1,350.79, a two-year high. The gains come amid speculation central banks will increase their stimulus measures following the Brexit vote. Bernard Aw from IG Markets added "silver has surged 17.5% or $3 since the Brexit vote, more than double the 7.5% gain in gold". "We could see more outperformance from silver in the near term, as moves in silver are often more substantial in both directions. The current market environment is boosting safe haven demand which is supportive for gold and silver." Meanwhile, Asian stock markets mostly fell on Tuesday, following five consecutive days of gains, after oil prices fell below $49 per barrel. Both Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 and the broader Topix shed about 1%. South Korea's Kospi is 0.3% lower. Australian stocks fell 0.6%, led by commodity stocks. In Greater China markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.9%. However, the Shanghai Composite bucked the trend and rose around 0.2% at the open.
