 One of the new small energy suppliers, Extra Energy, is to be investigated by regulator Ofgem after a record number of customer complaints. Last month, Citizens Advice said Extra Energy had had more complaints than any other supplier for the past five years.

Ofgem will also look at claims that account holders were prevented from transferring to rival suppliers. The company says it has now made a series of changes, including: Extra Energy also admitted that it had expanded too quickly. If Ofgem decides that Extra Energy did break the rules on dealing with customers, it has the power to impose a fine of up to 10% of the company's turnover. It is not known when the investigation will be finished.
