BUT THEY'VE CALLED IN THE CASH IN THE ATTIC TEAM 
TO HELP THEM MAKE A DAY OUT FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO REMEMBER 
CELINE ROBERTS HAS SURVIVED A TRAUMATIC UPBRINGING IN IRELAND 
AND INDEED HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT HER ORDEAL 
NOW RETIRED FROM A JOB IN NURSING SHE'S MARRIED AND HAS ONE SON AND A GRANDDAUGHTER 
SHE WANTS TO MOVE NEARER HER FAMILY SO HER HOUSE NEEDS DE CLUTTERING 
AND SHE'S ASKED HER FRIEND MARY AND THE CASH IN THE ATTIC TEAM FOR HELP 
JONTY MORNING YOU LET ME DOWN BADLY I'M SO DISAPPOINTED 
WHAT HAVE I DONE I THOUGHT I'D SEE YOU IN THAT POOL THIS MORNING 
THE SIGHT OF ME IN SWIMMING TRUNKS FIRST THING IN THE MORNING THAT'D BE TOO MUCH 
YOU'VE GOT THREE IRISH WOMEN LECHING AFTER YOU TODAY 
MM SOUNDS INTERESTING I THINK I SEE A TWINKLE IN YOUR EYE 
HI CELINE HELLO THANKS FOR ALLOWING US TO COME TO YOUR HOUSE 
THANK YOU MARY LISTEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNEEL WHEN I COME IN 
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GET UP TELL ME A BIT ABOUT THIS SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU TWO GIRLS 
WE MET ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AT THE LONDON IRISH SURVIVORS' GROUP 
IN CAMDEN WHICH IS A GROUP THAT WAS SET UP FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE IN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS IN IRELAND 
WE'RE NOT PARTICULARLY FAMILIAR WITH WHAT AN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL IS YES 
BUT WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE THAT IN GREAT DETAIL YES 
THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME CELINE WHY ARE YOU LOOKING TO DE CLUTTER YOUR HOUSE 
PARTLY BECAUSE I WANT TO MOVE FROM HERE CLOSER TO MY SON 
BECAUSE I LOOK AFTER MY GRANDDAUGHTER ON A MONDAY 
SHE STAYS WITH ME EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT 
SO I'D LIKE TO BE NEARER TO THEM WHEN SHE STARTS SCHOOL NEXT SEPTEMBER 
ARE YOU A BIT OF A COLLECTOR A HOARDER I AM I'M AFRAID 
COS WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE IN OUR CHILDHOOD AND THERE'S NEVER ANYTHING PRETTY SURROUNDING US 
SO I TEND TO PICK UP BITS THAT LOOK NICE MORE THAN FUNCTIONAL AT TIMES 
WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH YOU AT AUCTION THAT YOU DON'T BUY A WHOLE LOT BACK NEVER MIND SELL SOMETHING 
THAT'S TRUE I'LL BE VERY TEMPTED 
AND SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY ON 
I WAS SAYING EARLIER THAT IT'S A MEMORABLE DAY OUT BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO 
WE'RE PLANNING TO HAVE A DAY OUT WITH OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND ALSO 
MAYBE IF THERE'S ANYTHING LEFT OVER FOR US TO HAVE A BIT OF PAMPERING 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO ACTUALLY DO ALL THAT 
IF WE GET THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED IT'D BE GOOD YEAH ANYTHING REALLY 
I WAS TEASING JONTY OUR EXPERT OUTSIDE YEAH 
I SAID HE HAD THREE IRISH WOMEN LECHING AFTER HIM TODAY SO I THINK MAYBE 
WE BETTER GO AND DO A BIT OF LECHING AND SEARCHING AND RUMMAGING YES 
TO FIND SOME GOOD THINGS TO SELL RIGHT LET'S SEE WHERE HE IS 
SO WHERE IS JONTY HE'S NOT HIDING FROM US IS HE 
AH HELLO JONTY THE IRISH HAVE DESCENDED 
TRUST YOU THOUGH TO START OFF WITH A PUNCH BOWL 
JUST WHAT I WOULD'VE EXPECTED OF YOU IS THIS A BOWL THAT YOU USE YES 
YES I USE IT QUITE A LOT 
I HAVEN'T USED IT VERY MUCH RECENTLY BUT I USED TO MAKE 
A PUNCH IN IT WITH BRANDY AND WHITE WINE AND ORANGE JUICE 
WHERE DID IT COME FROM I BOUGHT IT FROM A LADY IN EALING ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO 
YOU'RE AWARE THAT IT'S SILVER PLATE RATHER THAN SOLID SILVER YES I AM YES 
I WASN'T AWARE WHEN I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT SILVER BACK THEN BUT YES I AM 
WERE YOU TOLD ITS AGE AT ALL 
I THINK THE LADY THAT SOLD IT TO ME TOLD ME IT WAS QUITE OLD 
BUT DIDN'T SAY HOW OLD AND I TOOK IT THAT IT WAS PROBABLY ANTIQUE 
WAS SHE FIBBING WELL SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN STRETCHING THE TRUTH SOMEWHAT BECAUSE 
I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY OLDER THAN THE SECOND WORLD WAR SO IT'S NO MORE THAN SIXTY SEVENTY YEARS OLD 
IS IT SOMETHING THAT CAN GO TO THE AUCTION SALE ABSOLUTELY YES 
WE'RE TALKING AT SALE FORTY SIXTY MAYBE EIGHTY THAT KIND OF BALLPARK 
YES AND WHAT DID YOU PAY FOR IT ORIGINALLY EIGHTY ORIGINALLY 
DID YOU RIGHT IT'D BE QUITE NICE IF WE COULD GET YOUR MONEY BACK 
IT WOULD BE NICE BUT WE COULD TRY THAT 
AT LEAST IT'S A FAIR START TODAY 
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF GOODIES SO LET'S GO AND FIND SOME MORE 
WE'RE AS PLEASED AS PUNCH WITH THAT FIRST FIND 
AS WE SEEK OUT MORE COLLECTIBLES JONTY'S FIRST TO MAKE THE NEXT FIND 
A NINE CARAT GOLD TOPPED UMBRELLA 
WORTH BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY 
MARY IS HOT ON JONTY'S HEELS 
WITH A MAHOGANY CASED MANTEL CLOCK 
VALUED AT AROUND FORTY 
IN THE MEANTIME 
CELINE'S BEEN BUSY UPSTAIRS 
JONTY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE 
WOW I SAY I LIKE THEM BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER 
AND UNLIKE YOUR PUNCH BOWL THESE ARE SILVER MM HMM 
SOLID SILVER TOPS WE'VE GOT THESE LOVELY HALLMARKS HERE 
YEAH THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE DEALERS VERY INTERESTED 
IT'S AN EDWARDIAN DRESSING TABLE SET 
RIGHT FOR A LADY 
THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF GETTING YOUR CREAMS AND POTIONS 
IN THE EDWARDIAN PERIOD WOULD BE THAT YOU WOULD COLLECT THEM 
WHEN YOU BOUGHT THEM THEY WOULD BE IN PACKETS AND SACHETS 
AND THEN YOU'D DISPENSE THEM INTO THESE BEAUTIFUL CONTAINERS 
THAT'D BE PERMANENTLY LEFT ON THE LADY'S DRESSING TABLE 
IN THE EDWARDIAN PERIOD 
YOUR DRESSING TABLE LIKE MANY OTHER FACETS OF YOUR LIFE WAS THERE 
TO SHOW OFF AND IF YOU COULD AFFORD IT YOUR DRESSING TABLE SET ALL HAD TO BE SILVER TOPPED JUST LIKE THIS 
VALUE WISE BALLPARK SIXTY TO EIGHTY 
OH THAT'S GREAT 
MUCH BETTER THAN SITTING IN THE CUPBOARD DOING NOTHING FOR YEARS 
GOOD LET'S SELL THEM YES O. K. ABSOLUTELY LET'S CARRY ON 
SO LEAVING JONTY UPSTAIRS WE LADIES TAKE A SHORT BREAK 
NOW I'M SURE CELINE AND MARY HAVE QUITE A TALE TO TELL ABOUT THEIR VERY DIFFICULT CHILDHOODS 
IN ANY IRISH HOUSEHOLD IT'S NICE TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A COSY CHAT BY THE FIRE YES 
I KNOW YOU'VE PUT YOUR LIFE STORY INTO BOOK FORM 
BUT I'D LIKE TO GO OVER THE AREA 
WHERE YOU WENT TO INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL 
YES I WAS FIVE MONTHS OLD WHEN I WAS TAKEN FROM THE HOME 
WHERE I WAS BORN WHICH WAS IN BLACKROCK IN CORK 
WHEN MY MOTHER WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD SHE WAS UNMARRIED WHEN SHE GOT PREGNANT 
WITH ME AND I WAS PUT INTO AN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL IN LIMERICK CITY 
HOW DID THE NUNS TREAT THE CHILDREN IN THESE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS 
THEY WERE LIKE PRISONS FOR CHILDREN REALLY 
WE HAD BIG GREY WALLS YOU DIDN'T GO OUTSIDE OF THEM 
MOST OF THE DAY WAS STRUCTURED YOU GOT UP AT SIX HUNDRED A M. 
YOU TURNED BACK YOUR BED WENT TO MASS YOU CLEANED THE DORMITORIES 
THEN YOU HAD BREAKFAST WHICH CONSISTED OF WATERY PORRIDGE 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF TODAY HAVING WRITTEN THE BOOK 
AMAZINGLY I FEEL STRONGER HAVING WRITTEN THE BOOK 
ON THE POSITIVE SIDE I HAVE A LOVELY LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER 
DARCY WHO'S THREE AND A HALF 
I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY MENDING AS WELL YEAH FOR YOU TO LIVE CLOSE TO HER YES 
SO WE HAVE GOT TO FIND ALL THESE ITEMS AROUND YOUR LOVELY HOUSE YES 
SO THAT WE CAN TAKE THEM TO AUCTION AND HOPEFULLY GET ENOUGH MONEY 
FOR THIS DAY OUT A DAY OUT 
YOU GIRLS DESERVE A PAMPER 
CELINE AND MARY'S RESILIENCE IN SPITE OF THE ADVERSITY THEY HAVE FACED IS REALLY HUMBLING 
RAISING THREE HUNDRED FOR A LITTLE PAMPERING AND A DAY OUT WITH THE GRANDCHILDREN 
IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO FOR THEM 
HELPING US IS THIS ITALIAN RED GLASS DECANTER AND GLASSES 
PAINTED WITH VENETIAN SCENES 
AND VALUED BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE AND FORTY FIVE 
WHILE CELINE AND I SEARCH IN ONE OF THE BEDROOMS 
I SPOT A VERY EYE CATCHING VASE 
THIS IS PARTICULARLY BEAUTIFUL YES OH MY GOODNESS IT'S GORGEOUS WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM 
I BOUGHT IT IN TRINITY ROAD 
QUITE A LONG TIME AGO IN A LITTLE ANTIQUE SHOP 
I HAVE FOUND WHAT I THINK IS A LOVELY PIECE O. K. I'M NOT THE TRAINED EYE BUT 
THAT'S LOVELY THIS IS PROPER CHINESE BLUE AND WHITE 
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE EARLIEST EVER DISCOVERY OF BLUE AND WHITE IS CHINESE BACK TO THE NINTH CENTURY 
WOW WHICH IS AMAZING MM HMM 
IS THIS YOUR PROPER CHINESE STUFF IT'S PROPER CHINESE STUFF 
AND IT'S ALL HAND DECORATED WOW BUT IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY SHIPLOADS CAME OVER TO THIS PART OF 
THE WORLD AND ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE COULD AFFORD IT IT WAS AFFORDABLE 
BUT AS A CONSEQUENCE A LOT OF IT'S AROUND MM HMM 
IT'S NOT GOING TO FETCH A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY AT AUCTION 
I'M DISAPPOINTED IT'S HUGELY DISAPPOINTING 
I'M BITING MY NAILS WANTING YOU TO SAY HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH 
YES IF YOU WERE TO PLACE THIS INTO THE AUCTION SALE YOU'RE LOOKING AT SIXTY EIGHTY MAYBE ONE HUNDRED 
BECAUSE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE SIZE 
RIGHT IT'S WORTH IT BUT IF IT WAS SMALLER ALMOST NEXT TO NOTHING 
SO ARE YOU GOING TO PUT IT UP FOR AUCTION 
I'D LIKE TO STILL THINK ABOUT IT 
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE AND I HAVE LOVED IT FOR A LONG TIME 
YOU KNOW SINCE I GOT IT 
SO I NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT A BIT LONGER NOT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SURE YET 
NOT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SURE YET ALL RIGHT 
I'LL POP THAT DOWN I'LL BE OFF INTO THE NEXT ROOM 
IT LOOKS VERY NICE ON THAT CABINET IT DOES ACTUALLY IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
YES I LIKE IT THERE 
ONWARDS AND UPWARDS 
WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE IF DE CLUTTERING WINS OUT 
OVER CELINE'S UNDERSTANDABLE ATTACHMENT TO THIS LOVELY PIECE 
OUR HUNT CONTINUES AND JONTY DIGS OUT THIS MAHOGANY COAL SCUTTLE 
WITH FLORAL BRASS DECORATION 
LET'S HOPE IT HEATS UP THE AUCTION ROOM AND RAISES BETWEEN THIRTY AND FIFTY 
MARY FIND THIS UNUSUAL BRASS TOP GLASS INKWELL 
WHICH WAS GIVEN TO CELINE YEARS AGO 
IT'S NOW WORTH BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY 
WE'RE NOT DOING TOO BADLY BUT THE THREE HUNDRED TARGET IS STILL SOME WAY OFF 
I WONDER HOW MUCH CELINE'S NEXT FIND WILL ADD TO OUR KITTY 
JONTY COULD YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THESE PLEASE 
OH A SET OF SPOONS HERE 
THEY'RE FROM CANADA OR THEY WERE ABOUT CANADA 
HAVING A LOOK HERE WE'VE GOT THE TEN PROVINCES OF CANADA HERE AND WE'VE GOT TWO SPOONS HERE 
THIS IS INTERESTING ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN TO NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN 
RIGHT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN WAS REALLY THE BIRTH OF MODERN DAY CANADA OH RIGHT 
IT WAS AN ACT CALLED THE BRITISH NORTH AMERICAN ACT OH RIGHT 
WHICH BROUGHT TOGETHER ALL THOSE TEN PROVINCES OF CANADA INTO WHAT OF COURSE WE NOW CALL CANADA 
CANADA YEAH VERY NICE TO SEE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN CLEANED TRUE TO FORM 
YES BUT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FAB BECAUSE THESE WILL BE SILVER PLATED 
RIGHT O. K. THAT'S WHAT THESE ARE SILVER PLATED SPOONS 
AS A WHOLE COLLECTION HERE THAT'S VERY GOOD NEWS INDEED 
O. K. VALUE WISE WE COULD BE MAKING A BIT OF A STIR FORTY TO SIXTY 
GREAT OH GREAT FANTASTIC 
HAPPY ABOUT THAT YES ABSOLUTELY 
EXCELLENT GIRLS FOLLOW ME WE'VE GOT MORE WORK TO DO YET RIGHT O. K. 
THEY'VE BEEN SITTING IN A DRAWER FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS 
SINCE WE BROUGHT THEM BACK FROM CANADA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE 
IT'D BE NICE IF MARY AND I COULD ENJOY A DAY OUT WITH THE PROCEEDS 
WELL CELINE SEEMS TO BE IN THE MOOD FOR CLEARING OUT HER CUTLERY 
AND REMEMBERS A CASE SET OF HALLMARKED SILVER KNIVES 
SHE'S HAPPY TO SELL THEM FOR THIRTY TO FORTY 
WHAT WE NEED ARE SOME FORKS TO COMPLETE THE SET 
BUT CELINE HAS OTHER PLANS NOW WHERE IS OUR ANTIQUE HUNTER 
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHERE I GOT THIS REALLY 
I HAVE A FUNNY FEELING SOMEBODY GAVE IT TO ME A LONG TIME AGO 
O. K. I DON'T REMEMBER BUYING IT 
YES SO IT MUST HAVE COME FROM SOMEBODY AND THAT'S NOT YOU NO 
ALTHOUGH I HAVE USED IT AT CHRISTMAS TIME 
WHAT CAUSES THOSE MARKS CRAZING INSIDE THE KILN AH OH RIGHT 
THIS PLATE IS DATED BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY MY GOODNESS 
IT'S THAT OLD 
BUT I TELL WHY IT'S SO INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE THIS HOUSE HERE IS THREE MILES AWAY FROM WHERE I LIVE 
MY GOODNESS YOU'RE NOT BEING SERIOUS 
I'M SERIOUS SO WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE DONE TAKEN MAYBE A SCENE 
INSPIRED BY CHINA AND PUT AN ENGLISH HOUSE ON THE CORNER 
WELL THIS IS INSPIRED BY THE CHINESE BLUE AND WHITE 
BUT THIS IS THE ENGLISH INTERPRETATION 
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE ENGLISH DESIGNS ENGLISH PATTERNS 
YOU DON'T SEE THE ORIENTAL SCENE 
YOU SEE THE TRANQUIL COUNTRY ENGLISH SCENES WITH THE ENGLISH HOUSE THE ENGLISH CHURCH 
THE THATCHED ROOF AND DOWN BELOW WE'VE GOT THE GENTLEMAN FISHING 
WHAT LOOKS LIKE FISHING ON THE LAKE 
WONDERFUL THING BALLPARK I SUPPOSE ANYTHING BETWEEN FIFTY MAYBE ONE HUNDRED 
VERY GOOD VERY NICE HOW COOL WOULD THAT BE IF IT GOT ONE HUNDRED 
HOW ABOUT THAT THAT'S GREAT WHAT D'YOU THINK MARY 
GOOD RESULT ISN'T IT 
ABSOLUTELY I'M SURE YOU'RE ANXIOUS TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH 
YOU'VE RAISED BECAUSE YOU WANTED THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED TO HAVE THAT FABULOUS DAY OUT WITH YOUR GRANDCHILDREN 
ABOUT MY PERSON I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO SEE THIS BY THE WAY 
AS WE WERE WASHING THE DISHES I'VE WRITTEN IT ALL DOWN

YOU WILL YOU'LL HAVE A GREAT DAY FOR THAT AND IF YOU DECIDE TO PUT THE VASE IN THE AUCTION YES 
YOU WILL HAVE THE GRAND TOTAL OF FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE WE'LL HAVE TO PUT IT IN MARY OH WE'LL HAVE TO YES 
I THINK A BIT OF A MASSAGE AND A FACIAL AND SOMETHING SPOILING FOR THAT
