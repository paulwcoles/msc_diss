GOOD EVENING AT LAST WE'VE HAD SOME SPRING LIKE WARMTH AND SUNSHINE 
SOME OF US WILL HAVE A REPEAT SHOW DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY 
HOWEVER FOR SOME EASTERN AREAS IN PARTICULAR THE RAIN MAY HANG AROUND 
THIS WAS THE CLOUD THAT CLEARED AWAY ON TUESDAY 
THIS IS THE ARC OF CLOUD APPROACHING FROM THE ATLANTIC 
WHICH WILL BRING OUR NEXT DOSE OF WET WEATHER 
IT DOESN'T LOOK HEAVY 
BY MORNING IT SHOULD'VE CLEARED THROUGH NORTHERN IRELAND 
INTO WESTERN SCOTLAND AND WALES 
AHEAD OF IT WE COULD HAVE MIST FOG LOW CLOUD 
IT'LL BE CHILLY IN THE VALE OF YORK BUT MOST OF US'LL HAVE A MILD NIGHT 
A GREY START ESPECIALLY UNDER THAT RAIN BAND 
IT'LL TAKE A FEW HOURS TO GET INTO YORKSHIRE AND LINCOLNSHIRE 
BUT ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT VERY HEAVY THE RAIN WILL BE AROUND FOR A FEW HOURS 
THERE WILL BE HILL FOG UNDER THAT CLOUD AND RAIN 
IN THE NORTHEAST OF SCOTLAND IT MIGHT TAKE UNTIL LUNCH 
FOR THE NORTHERN ISLES IT COULD BE THE EVENING BEFORE THE RAIN ARRIVES 
SO A DRYISH DAY AND FOLLOWING AS WELL 
BELFAST AND THE REST OF NORTHERN IRELAND ENJOYING DRY BRIGHT WEATHER 
SOME SUNSHINE TOO 
AND SIMILAR CONDITIONS ACROSS WALES AND THE SOUTHWEST 
THERE MIGHT BE AN OVERHANG OF CLOUD 
THERE COULD BE MORNING MISTINESS BUT IT SHOULD CLEAR QUICKLY 
IT'S A WESTERLY WIND WHICH WILL FEED THAT RAIN EASTWARDS 
THAT DOES MEAN THAT WE'LL ALSO LOSE OUR SOUTHEAST WIND 
FROM ALL BUT THE FAR NORTHEAST OF SCOTLAND 
THAT RAIN WILL BE BLOWN AWAY 
CLEARING EAST ANGLIA THE EAST COAST OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND BY EVENING 
STILL HANGING ON ACROSS ABERDEENSHIRE 
WE'VE STILL GOT THAT SOUTHEASTERLY WIND I WAS TALKING ABOUT 
SO JUST TEN OR ELEVEN BUT FOR MOST OF US 
THE TEMPERATURES WILL RESPOND AND GET UP TO THE MID TEENS AT VERY LEAST 
WE COULD SEE TEMPERATURES A DEGREE OR SO HIGHER IN LONDON 
BY THE END OF THE AFTERNOON 
SIXTEEN ALREADY IN CARDIFF AND FIFTEEN IN PLYMOUTH 
SO A PLEASANT DAY TO COME HERE 
WE'LL HAVE WATERINGS FOR THE GARDEN THROUGH THE NIGHT 
THERE'S STILL THE CHANCE OF A SHOWER ESPECIALLY FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
BUT THEY'LL BE FAIRLY HIT AND MISS 
THE RAIN EVENTUALLY CLEARS THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING 
AND A BIT OF MIST RETURNS TO THE EAST COAST 
BUT THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT WEATHER SYSTEMS COMING IN ALL THE TIME 
THIS WEATHER FRONT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL GIVE US HEAVY RAIN 
THAT MARCHES ITS WAY ACROSS THE U. K. DURING THURSDAY 
GIVING WAY TO DRIER WEATHER AGAIN NOT SO QUICKLY THIS TIME 
BUT THE SHOWERS FOLLOWING WILL BE MORE SIGNIFICANT 
SOME HEAVY SHOWERS WITH HAIL AND THUNDER 
IT STAYS UNSETTLED IN THE NORTH AS WE HEAD TOWARD THE WEEKEND 
SOUTHERN AREAS ON FRIDAY MIGHT GET AWAY WITH SOME DECENT WEATHER 
SEVENTEEN DEGREES POTENTIALLY IN LONDON 
SATURDAY DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD EITHER WITH JUST A FEW SHOWERS LATE ON 
THAT'S YOUR WEATHER MORE ON OUR WEBSITE BYE BYE
