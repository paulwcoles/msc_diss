BUYING AT AUCTION IS EXCITING AND NERVE WRACKING 
AND IT'S SO FAST IN SECONDS YOU COULD BE THE OWNER OF A HOUSE 
SO IF YOU'RE THINKING OF BUYING AT AUCTION IT'S BEST TO BE PREPARED LET'S FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED 
WHEN THE HAMMER FELL AT THE AUCTIONS ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME 
I INVESTIGATE WHY THIS COTTAGE IN BERKSHIRE HAS HAD ITS DAY 
WELL HERE'S THE HOUSE ON FIRST GLANCE IT LOOKS PERFECT 
THIS DERBY SEMI LOOKS GREAT FOR AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD 
I KNOW PEOPLE WHO SPECIFICALLY LOOK FOR NINETEEN THIRTIES PROPERTIES 
BECAUSE THEY REALLY LIKE THE BUILD QUALITY AND THE DESIGN OF THEM 
YOU WOULDN'T THINK I'D GET LOST IN THIS LITTLE HOUSE 
IN BASINGSTOKE HOWEVER 
IT JUST FEELS LIKE A WARREN OF DOORS AND LOOK 
THERE'S JUST CUPBOARDS EVERYWHERE 
ALL THESE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN SOLD AT AUCTION 
AND WE'LL FIND OUT WHO BOUGHT THEM AND WHAT THEY PAID 
WHEN THEY WENT UNDER THE HAMMER SOLD 
I'M ON THE TRAIL OF ANOTHER GREAT AUCTION PROPERTY 
AND MY BLOODHOUND TRACKING SKILLS HAVE TAKEN ME 
TO THE BERKSHIRE TOWN OF READING AND MORE SPECIFICALLY 
TO WINNERSH ONE OF ITS MOST DESIRABLE SUBURBS 
IT HAS GOOD CONNECTIONS INTO CENTRAL LONDON 
BUT WHAT'S REALLY BROUGHT ME HERE TODAY WELL TIME TO FIND OUT 
I WANT TO NOW WHAT LOT NUMBER NINETEEN HAS TO OFFER 
WELL IN THE CATALOGUE IT SAYS A DEVELOPMENT SITE 
A VACANT DETACHED BUNGALOW LOCATED IN A POPULAR RESIDENTIAL LOCATION 
IT'S GOT OUTLINE PLANNING PERMISSION FOR THE ERECTION OF TWO DETACHED HOUSES WITH GARAGES 
WELL HERE'S THE HOUSE ON FIRST GLANCE IT LOOKS PERFECT 
A GREAT ROOF LOVELY WINDOWS 
A FANTASTIC LOCATION BUT LET ME DO THE MATHS FOR YOU 
THIS HOUSE'S CURRENT VALUE IS WORTH TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
BUT TO BUILD TWO NEW SPANKY EXECUTIVE HOMES 
YOU COULD ACHIEVE UP TO FOUR HUNDRED GRAND APIECE 
NOW WITH FIGURES LIKE THAT YOU CAN SEE THE BULLDOZERS QUEUING UP DOWN THE ROAD 
BUT BEFORE WE LET THE WRECKING BALL HAVE ITS WAY IT'S WORTH HAVING A LOOK INSIDE 
THERE ARE TWO BEDROOMS 
A LOUNGE LEADING TO A CONSERVATORY 
THERE'S NOTHING FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG WITH THE BUNGALOW 
AND MANY PEOPLE WOULD LOVE TO LIVE IN SUCH A PLACE 
THE ONLY SNAG IS THAT IT'S ON A VERY LARGE PLOT 
LARGE ENOUGH IN FACT TO BE A VERY APPEALING PROSPECT FOR A DEVELOPER 
THIS PROPERTY COMES WITH OUTLINE PLANNING PERMISSION 
NOW OUTLINE PLANNING PERMISSION 
IS WHEN YOU HAVE PERMISSION IN PRINCIPLE 
FOR THE ERECTION OF A BUILDING BEFORE GOING TO ALL THE EXPENSE 
OF HAVING DETAILED PLANS PREPARED SO WHOEVER BUYS THIS 
WILL HAVE TO GET AN ARCHITECT INVOLVED TO COMPLETE THE PLANNING PROCESS 
STILL THERE ARE POSITIVE ASPECTS TO THE PLANS NOT BEING FINALISED 
THE COUNCIL HAVE AGREED OUTLINE PLANNING PERMISSION 
TO BUILD TWO DETACHED TWO BEDROOM HOUSES WITH GARAGES ON THIS SITE 
BUT THERE'S STILL THE FREEDOM TO DESIGN THE EXACT SPECIFICATIONS 
WHICH IS A BIG BONUS TO FIND OUT WHAT SORT OF DEMAND THERE IS 
FOR PROPERTY IN THE AREA YOU ONLY HAVE TO TAKE A SHORT WALK 
WHENEVER I BUY PROPERTY I LIKE TO SPEND AN AFTERNOON 
JUST LOOKING AROUND THE AREA TO SEE WHAT'S ABOUT 
I KNOW I'M IN A GOOD LOCATION WHEN I SEE A HUGE DEVELOPMENT SITE LIKE THIS ONE 
WHEN I SEE A BUILDING FIRM WITH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE 
I KNOW THEY WILL HAVE RESEARCHED THE AREA THOROUGHLY 
BEFORE SHELLING OUT LARGE SUMS OF MONEY ON A PLOT OF LAND LIKE THIS 
SO ANY SMALL TIME DEVELOPER WHO'S BUILDING IN THE VICINITY 
WILL BE UP AGAINST THE BIG BOYS ON FIRST GLANCE THOUGH 
YOU MAY THINK A SMALL TIMER CAN'T COMPETE WITH THIS COMPANY 
BUT I'VE SPOTTED A WAY OF MAKING THE COMPETITION MORE EVEN 
AND THAT'S SIMPLY DO YOUR RESEARCH 
KNOWING THE AREA YOU'RE BUYING IN 
WILL HELP WHEN IT COMES TO DESIGNING THOSE HOUSES 
I'VE HAD A WANDER AROUND TODAY AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE SOME 
POPULAR SCHOOLS AND AN EFFICIENT TRAIN SERVICE FROM NEARBY WINNERSH STATION 
TO LONDON AND READING SO I'D BE LOOKING TO THE YOUNG FAMILY MARKET 
TO FIND OUT MORE I INVITED THE AUCTIONEER SELLING THE PLOT 
TO GIVE ME HIS OPINION ON THIS DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY 
PERSONALLY I THINK THERE IS 
MONEY TO BE MADE HERE I THINK THAT SOMEBODY WILL BUY THIS 
WITH A VIEW IN MIND TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE PROPERTIES HERE 
OR ENHANCE THE PLANS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PASSED 
IT SEEMS THE DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL OF THIS PLOT HAS NOT GONE UNNOTICED 
ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN'T BEEN CONDUCTING ERM 
VIEWINGS INSIDE THE PROPERTY 
WE'VE BEEN INUNDATED WITH ENQUIRIES FROM PEOPLE WHO'VE REQUESTED THE LEGAL PACK 
IN THE LEAD UP TO THE AUCTION THERE'S BEEN A GREAT BUZZ ABOUT THIS PLOT 
LET'S SEE IF IT LIVES UP TO THE HYPE WHEN IT GOES UNDER THE HAMMER 
WE'RE SELLING WITH OUTLINE PLANNING PERMISSION 
FOR THE ERECTION OF TWO DETACHED HOUSES WITH GARAGES

SECOND TIME 
THIRD AND FINAL TIME 
SOLD TO THE MAN IN BROWN FOR FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THOUSAND 
WELL DONE SIR 
THE MAN IN BROWN TURNS OUT TO BE ANDREW 
HE'S HALF OF A BUILDING TEAM THE OTHER HALF IS PHILIP 
THEY'VE BEEN IN PROPERTY FOR A LONG TIME 
THEY STARTED OFF AS ESTATE AGENTS WHICH IS HOW THEY MET 
THEN EIGHT YEARS AGO THEY SET UP THEIR OWN COMPANY 
TO WORK ON SMALL SCALE BUILDING PROJECTS 
AND HAVE BEEN GOING STRONG EVER SINCE 
CONGRATULATIONS SO HOW INTENT WERE YOU ON BUYING THIS LOT AT AUCTION 
WE WERE VERY VERY KEEN BECAUSE WE LIKED THE LOCATION 
AND IT WAS THE SORT OF DEVELOPMENT WE'D PREFER TO WORK ON 
SOMETHING WE ENJOY AND WE WERE ABLE TO BUY IT 
BEFORE GETTING TO THE LIMIT WE'D SET OURSELVES 
WAS THIS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY 
OH YES YEAH THE VALUE OF THE BUNGALOW WASN'T WORTH DOING UP 
SO IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE IF WE SECURED IT BUILDING TWO NEW HOUSES HERE 
RIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THESE THEN 
ANDREW AND PHILIP WERE ATTRACTED TO THE SITE'S POTENTIAL 
BECAUSE OF THE MANY GOOD SCHOOLS NEARBY WHICH SHOULD APPEAL TO FAMILY BUYERS 
THEY HAVE BEEN FRIENDS AND SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS PARTNERS 
FOR MANY YEARS SO I'M KEEN TO FIND OUT HOW THEY SHARE THE WORKLOAD 
IT WORKS VERY WELL BECAUSE WE'VE BOTH BEEN INVOLVED IN PROPERTY FOR A LONG TIME 
SO WE BOTH GET INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN MATTERS 
AND THEN WE VERY MUCH LIKE TO GET OUR HANDS DIRTY 
AND GET DOWN AND DIG THE FOOTINGS OUT 
SO HOW DOES IT COMPARE BEING AN ESTATE AGENT 
TO ACTUALLY DOING THE JOB YOU KNOW RENOVATING BUYING SELLING FINDING LOCATIONS 
WELL WE'VE SEEN IT FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE FENCE IF YOU LIKE 
COS BEING ESTATE AGENTS WE'D SEEN IT FROM A SELLING POINT OF VIEW 
AND NOW WE LIKE TO GET OUR HANDS DIRTY WITH THE VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT WE GET INVOLVED IN 
WORKING FOR YOURSELF YOU SEE SOMETHING THROUGH FROM THE BEGINNING 
THROUGH TO WHEN THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MOVE IN 
SO AND WE TEND TO TRY AND LOOK AT PLANS 
AND THE SPECIFICATIONS OF HOUSES 
AND LOOK AT THEM ON THE BASIS THAT WE WANT THEM TO BE INDIVIDUAL 
AND SOMETHING HOPEFULLY A LITTLE SPECIAL 
I AM DYING TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH THIS 
ON FIRST LOOKS IT LOOKED LIKE YOU SHOULDN'T BE PULLING THIS DOWN 
BUT I CAN SEE THE MATHS BEHIND IT 
SHALL WE GO OUT TO THE GARDEN AND HAVE A CHAT ABOUT IT GREAT YEAH 
ON THE WAY OUT THE BOYS COULDN'T RESIST TELLING ME 
THAT THE TWO NEW HOUSES 
ARE LIKELY TO BE AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TIMBER FRAMED DESIGN 
WHAT ELSE DO THEY PLAN TO DO 
SO THIS HOUSE IS COMING DOWN ARE YOU GOING TO BE TWEAKING THE OUTLINE PLANS THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE 
YES THE CONSENT WAS FOR A TWO BEDROOM 
AND THE PLANS THAT WE'RE SUBMITTING IS FOR A FOUR BEDROOM 
SO YOU'VE MOVED THE PARTITIONS FROM A TWO BED TO CREATE A FOUR BED 
AREN'T THEY SMALL 
NO THE ROOMS ARE STILL GOOD UPSTAIRS 
IT'S JUST THAT THE TWO BEDROOMS THAT WERE THERE ON THE ORIGINAL PLANS 
WERE DISPROPORTIONATE THEY WERE ENORMOUS 
AND IT REALLY DID BEG TO BE BETTER PLANNED 
AND STILL GET FOUR BEDROOMS 
ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE A LITTLE CONCERNED OR WORRIED ABOUT WITH THIS 
AS ALWAYS 
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TREPIDATION WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITY 
IN TERMS OF BUILDING WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO AND FINDING IT ACCEPTABLE TO THEM 
INEVITABLY THERE'LL BE NEGOTIATION WITH THEM AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING 
THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO THEM AND THAT WE ARE HAPPY AND LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING 
LOCAL AUTHORITY PROBLEMS ASIDE 
ANDREW AND PHILIP COULD DO WELL OUT OF THIS DEVELOPMENT 
THEY'RE PLANNING TO BUILD TWO FOUR BEDROOM HOUSES 
WHICH COULD BE SOLD FOR NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN TOTAL 
BUILD COSTS FOR BOTH HOUSES 
ARE LIKELY TO BE AROUND THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND MARK 
SO ADDED TO THE FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THOUSAND PRICE PAID AT AUCTION FOR THE LAND 
THAT WOULD MAKE THEM A PROFIT OF AROUND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
GUYS I HOPE THE PLANNERS LOOK UPON THIS PROJECT FONDLY AND IT ALL GOES YOUR WAY 
IT'S BEEN LOVELY MEETING YOU THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AGAIN 
ANDREW AND PHILIP'S ESTATE AGENT BACKGROUND 
GIVES THEM A BIG ADVANTAGE IN THE PROPERTY BUSINESS 
THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT BUYERS WANT IN A HOME 
WE'LL FIND OUT IF THEIR EXPERIENCE STANDS THEM IN GOOD STEAD 
WHEN WE COME BACK LATER IN THE SHOW 
I'M IN DERBY IN THE EAST MIDLANDS 
TO SEE AN AUCTION PROPERTY GUIDED AT JUST SIXTY THOUSAND 
NOW SIXTY THOUSAND QUID DOESN'T BUY YOU A LOT IN THE PROPERTY WORLD THESE DAYS 
UNLESS YOU COME TO SUNNY HILL IN DERBY 
IT'S A REASONABLE RESIDENTIAL AREA AND UP FOR GRABS AT THE AUCTION WAS THIS 
IT IS A TWO BEDROOM NINETEEN THIRTIES SEMI DETACHED 
LOOKS IN REASONABLE CONDITION FROM THE OUTSIDE 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK INSIDE 
NOW I KNOW PEOPLE WHO SPECIFICALLY LOOK FOR NINETEEN THIRTIES PROPERTIES 
BECAUSE THEY REALLY LIKE THE BUILD QUALITY AND THE DESIGN OF THEM 
I SEE WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM THEY'RE VERY SOLID 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET AND THIS IS NO DIFFERENT IT HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED VERY MUCH 
I IMAGINE SINCE IT WAS BUILT ONE OF THE DOWN SIDES OF THAT IS IN THE KITCHEN 
WE CAN SEE IT'S VERY NARROW IT'S CRAMPED SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO HERE 
WELL THIS WALL 
FEELS VERY SOLID BUT 
I THINK THIS HAS GOT TO COME OUT CREATE A KITCHEN DINING ROOM 
BECAUSE THE DINING ROOM IS ACTUALLY NEXT DOOR AND THAT WOULD TOTALLY TRANSFORM THE HOUSE 
PUT SOME NICE UNITS IN HERE I WOULD DO THAT STRAIGHT AWAY 
THE STAIRS LEADING UP THERE AND THROUGH TO THE OTHER MAIN ROOM DOWNSTAIRS 
WHICH IS YOUR FRONT LIVING ROOM AREA BIG WINDOWS BAY FRONTED 
WE LIKE THAT AND IT NEEDS REFURBISHMENT 
BUT IT'S A GOOD SIZED SPACE IT'S LIGHT IT'S AIRY 
YEAH AS I SAID IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT 
IT'S GOOD 
AND AS YOU'D EXPECT FROM A PROPERTY OF THIS AGE IT NEEDS A LITTLE T. L. C. 
BUT APART FROM SOME DAMP I'VE FOUND NOTHING OF MAJOR CONCERN 
I SHOULD HAVE LOVED YOU BETTER 
FROM THE START 
SO UPSTAIRS THIS AGAIN FEELS LIKE A REALLY SOLID KIND OF HOUSE 
DOUBLE BEDROOM THERE SORT OF SMALL DOUBLE 
A BATHROOM WHICH IS DEFINITELY IN NEED OF REFURBISHMENT 
BUT IT'S A GOOD SIZE AND THEN THROUGH INTO A REAL DELIGHT 
THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM YOU'VE GOT THIS HUGE GREAT WINDOW HERE 
A FLOOR WHICH IS JUST CRYING OUT TO BE STRIPPED 
ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS BUT THEN A FEW ISSUES 
JUDGING BY THE LIGHTS I THINK THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED 
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO REPLACE THE WINDOWS NICE THOUGH THEY ARE 
FIREPLACE GET RID OF THAT BUT OVERALL IT'S A GOOD SIZE 
AND IT'S A NICE ROOM YEAH IT'S A GOOD HOUSE 
WHILE SOME AREAS NEED A COMPLETE OVERHAUL 
THERE'S STILL A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THE HOUSE 
I THINK THAT ONCE RENOVATED IT WILL MAKE A LOVELY HOME 
WELL ANOTHER NICE THING ABOUT HOUSES OF THIS ERA 
IS THAT THEY CAME WITH PRETTY LARGE GARDENS AND THIS ONE'S NO DIFFERENT 
YOU COME OUT THE REAR TO THIS SPACE AND THEN IT CONTINUES BACK THERE 
PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHTY FEET IN TOTAL 
WELL IT'S A GREAT UTILITY SPACE BUT IT ALSO MEANS 
YOU COULD THINK ABOUT EXTENDING OUT AT THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY 
AND YOU WOULDN'T LOSE TOO MUCH OF THE GARDEN YEP A GOOD TO HAVE 
COUPLED WITH THAT GUIDE PRICE OF JUST SIXTY THOUSAND 
IT ALL SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE 
WHAT DOES A LOCAL PROPERTY EXPERT 
THINK OF THIS SOLID LITTLE SEMI IN SUNNY HILL 
THE REAL BENEFIT OF THE HOUSE HERE 
IS THE FACT IT GIVES A BLANK CANVAS FOR THE OWNERS TO WORK WITH 
THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO TAKE AWAY SOMEONE ELSE'S EFFORTS 
THEY CAN START FROM SCRATCH 
TO RENOVATE THIS PLACE COMPLETELY 
COULD COST AS MUCH AS FIFTEEN THOUSAND OR TWENTY THOUSAND 
WHAT DOES THE AGENT THINK ABOUT BUILDING AN EXTENSION 
EITHER OUT INTO THE GARDEN OR INTO THE LOFT 
WOULD IT ADD VALUE 
THIS PARTICULAR STYLE OF HOME 
WAS BUILT ON A NUMBER OF STREETS IN THIS AREA 
THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAVE HAD EXTENSIONS 
NORMALLY GROUND FLOOR TO THE REAR SOME TWO STOREY TO THE SIDE 
AND SOME ATTIC CONVERSIONS 
AN OWNER HERE WOULD ONLY REALLY CHOOSE TO EXTEND 
IF IT SUITED THEIR PURPOSES 
THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO MAKE A PROFIT BY INVESTING IN THAT EXTENSION 
SO TO ENSURE THERE'S A PROFIT ON THIS DEVELOPMENT 
THE MESSAGE IS MAKE THE BEST OF WHAT'S ALREADY HERE 
THE GUIDE PRICE IS SIXTY THOUSAND BUT HOW MUCH COULD IT BE WORTH ONCE FINISHED 
THE PROPERTY'S LIKELY TO BE SOLD ONCE IT'S COMPLETED 
IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
WELL NOT A LOT OF SURPRISES WITH THIS ONE 
IT IS EXACTLY AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT A REAL SOLID LITTLE SEMI 
LET'S SEE WHO SPOTTED THE OPPORTUNITY AT THE AUCTION 
LOT NUMBER SEVEN IS NUMBER ELEVEN GRENFELL AVENUE IN SUNNY HILL 
WHO'S GOING TO BE BOLD AND PUT IT STRAIGHT IN AT EIGHTY THOUSAND 
O. K. WELL IT WAS WORTH ASKING

THIRD AND LAST OPPORTUNITY 
SOLD AT ONE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND THANK YOU 
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL AN EXCITING AUCTION 
BUT THE LADY WHO FINALLY WON THE BATTLE WAS RUTH 
WHO'S BROUGHT BUSINESS PARTNER SALLY ALONG TO CHECK OUT HER PURCHASE 
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT THE HOUSE WOULD FETCH FORTY TWO THOUSAND 
OVER THE GUIDE PRICE OF SIXTY 
SO HOW WAS THE AUCTION FOR YOU VERY EXCITING I WENT OVER MY BUDGET 
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT WHAT WAS YOUR BUDGET ABOUT NINETY EIGHT 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU PAID THEN YEAH YEAH 
SO WHY DID YOU PICK THIS PARTICULAR HOUSE THEN 
I LOVE THE HOUSE I LOVE IT IT'S GOT A NICE FEEL 
IT'S A NICE LITTLE ROAD IT'S QUIET 
MY DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL'S ROUND HERE 
I'M RENTING AT THE MOMENT SO I'D RATHER GET OUT OF THE RENTING MARKET 
AND MOVE INTO HERE FOR A SHORT WHILE BEFORE WE SELL IT ON AND THEN START AGAIN 
SO YOU ARE BUYING IT TO DO UP PRIMARILY 
BUT YOU ARE GOING TO LIVE IN HERE IN THE MEANTIME 
YES THAT'S RIGHT FOR POSSIBLY ABOUT SIX MONTHS 
AND SEE WHAT'S ON THE MARKET AND START AGAIN 
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A CHAIN REACTION 
RUTH WHO'S A DIVORCEE AND PART TIME SWIMMING TEACHER 
NEEDED SOMETHING TO SUPPLEMENT HER SMALL INCOME 
AND HELP RAISE HER FOURTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER 
PROPERTY DEVELOPING EMERGED AS AN OPTION 
I WAS WAITING FOR A DIVORCE SETTLEMENT TO COME THROUGH AND THE JOB CENTRE PHONED ME UP 
OUT OF THE BLUE AND OFFERED ME SOME RETRAINING 
AND THE ONLY THING I COULD THINK ABOUT 
WAS POSSIBLY A BIT OF PROPERTY DEVELOPING 
RIGHT SO WHAT WAS THE TRAINING YOU DID I DID A PLASTERING COURSE 
A BRICKLAYING COURSE AND A PLUMBING COURSE 
WERE YOU VERY PRACTICAL BEFORE THIS IS THIS THE SORT OF THING YOU DID 
NO NOT AT ALL I HADN'T DONE ANYTHING 
I HADN'T EVEN REWIRED A PLUG BEFORE 
SO THE IDEA WAS THEN THAT YOU WOULD DO ALL THE WORK ON THE PROPERTIES THAT YOU BOUGHT IN THE FUTURE 
MOST OF IT YES SO YOU'VE GOT THE SKILLS THEN SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT 
I WENT TO AN AUCTION A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
BOUGHT MY FIRST HOUSE TOTALLY GUTTED IT AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN 
RIGHT SO WAS THAT A SUCCESS YOUR FIRST PROJECT 
YES MANAGED TO MAKE SOME MONEY OUT OF IT 
YES ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND OH GREAT 
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE TRAINING'S PAID OFF 
AND RUTH'S CONFIDENT SHE CAN TACKLE THIS RENOVATION 
WITH PLENTY TO FIX SHE SHOULD BE IN HER ELEMENT 
SO WHAT'S SHE GOT PLANNED 
I'M GOING TO PUT NEW WINDOWS IN NOT ALL OF THEM BUT JUST SOME OF THEM 
KNOCK THROUGH FROM THE KITCHEN TO THE DINING ROOM TO MAKE A BIG DINING KITCHEN 
FRENCH DOORS IN THE DINING ROOM AND MAYBE EVENTUALLY 
PUT A THIRD BEDROOM IN THE LOFT 
IT DEPENDS ON THE BUDGET BUT THAT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING FOR THE FUTURE 
AND THE BUDGET 
SEVEN THOUSAND TO EIGHT THOUSAND OH RIGHT 
YES IT'S QUITE SMALL THIS TIME 
YEAH IS THAT INCLUDING YOUR KITCHEN AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT IS AND THE BATHROOM YES 
SEVEN THOUSAND TO EIGHT THOUSAND DOES SOUND VERY TIGHT TO ME 
BUT RUTH ISN'T TACKLING THIS PROJECT ALONE 
BUSINESS PARTNER SALLY WILL ALSO BE INVOLVED 
SALLY WHAT WILL YOU DO ON THE PROJECT I'M GOING TO START STRIPPING THE WALLS DOWN 
SO GETTING THE LOVELY WOODCHIP OFF THE WALLS THAT'S A HECK OF A JOB 
AND THE CEILING YEAH THEN THEY'LL BE READY FOR RUTH TO PLASTER 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF RUTH'S NEW FOUND SKILLS THE PLASTERING AND THE BRICKLAYING 
YEAH I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT SHE DID THE COURSES 
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT SAVES A LOT OF MONEY AND SHE DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB 
SHE LOVES DOING IT AND SHE'S GOT PLASTERING DOWN TO A T. 
WE'LL FIND OUT LATER WHAT IMPACT RUTH'S HANDIWORK HAS ON THIS HOUSE 
I DON'T FORESEE ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS BUT I DO WONDER 
IF THE BUDGET OF SEVEN THOUSAND TO EIGHT THOUSAND IS ENOUGH FOR ALL THE WORK 
WELL RUTH HAS PICKED HERSELF UP AFTER A DIVORCE 
BEEN ON THAT COURSE WHICH I THINK IS A FANTASTIC IDEA TO LEARN THOSE BASIC SKILLS 
AND IS NOW DEFINITELY EMBARKING ON THE CAREER AS A PROPERTY DEVELOPER 
HOW WILL SHE AND SALLY GET ON WITH THIS PLACE 
YOU CAN FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW 
COMING UP THIS HOUSE IN BASINGSTOKE IS IN AN AREA OF HIGH DEMAND 
SO AT THE RIGHT PRICE THIS COULD BE A GREAT BUY 
BACK IN DERBY SWIMMING INSTRUCTOR RUTH GOES THE EXTRA LENGTH 
THE PROJECT'S TAKEN LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT 
I SUPPOSE YOU ALWAYS RUN INTO PROBLEMS 
BUT FIRST WE RETURN TO WINNERSH IN BERKSHIRE 
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S BECOME OF THIS OLD COTTAGE 
IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR SINCE I VISITED THIS LOVELY PROPERTY 
IN WINNERSH BERKSHIRE IT WAS BOUGHT AT AUCTION 
BY DEVELOPERS ANDREW AND PHILIP FOR FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THOUSAND 
THAT MIGHT SEEM A LOT OF MONEY FOR WHAT'S ESSENTIALLY A RURAL COTTAGE 
WITH A CEILING PRICE OF ABOUT THE AMOUNT THEY PAID FOR IT 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR THIS PLACE RENOVATION WASN'T AN OPTION 
FROM THE MOMENT THE HAMMER FELL THIS LITTLE COTTAGE 
HAD A DATE WITH DESTINY IT HAD BEEN TARGETED FOR TERMINATION 
THEME FROM THE TERMINATOR BY BRAD FIEDEL 
ANDREW AND PHILIP HAVE SUCCEEDED WHERE MANY DEVELOPERS FAIL 
WHERE THE COTTAGE ONCE STOOD THERE ARE NOW TWO NEW HOUSES 
HERE I AM SIGNED SEALED DELIVERED I'M YOURS 
THE OLD BUNGALOW SAT JUST ALMOST WHERE THAT FRONT DOOR IS THERE 
BOTH HOUSES ARE ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME 
THIS ONE'S RUNNING ABOUT SIX WEEKS BEHIND THE OTHER 
IT'S STILL GOT TO BE DECORATED AND INTERNAL DOORS 
GENERALLY A SECOND FIX HAS GOT TO BE DONE 
BUT WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THE GENERAL OUTCOME AND THE SITUATION 
AND HOW THEY MARRY IN WITH THE ORIGINAL CHALET AT THE END OF THE DRIVE THERE 
HERE I AM BABY WHOA 
SIGNED SEALED DELIVERED I'M YOURS 
ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT QUITE READY FOR DELIVERY YET 
TWO HOUSES FOR THE PRICE OF ONE IS QUITE A RESULT 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING INSIDE 
ON THE FIRST FLOOR WE'VE GOT THE MASTER BEDROOM 
WITH AN EN SUITE SHOWER ROOM ONE BEDROOM 
ANOTHER BEDROOM AND THEN THE FAMILY BATHROOM HERE 
AND THEN WE COME THROUGH INTO WHAT WE THINK IS A BONUS ROOM 
WHEN WE ORIGINALLY PURCHASED THE SITE 
WE WERE ABLE TO GO BACK WITH REVISED PLANNING 
AND AS MUCH AS THE APPEARANCE OF THE PROPERTY HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL 
WE'VE MANAGED TO FIT A FOURTH BEDROOM OVER THE TOP OF THE GARAGE USING VELUX WINDOWS 
THE HOUSES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED WITH A FAMILY IN MIND 
DOWNSTAIRS THERE ARE TWO LARGE LIVING AREAS 
A SMALL CLOAKROOM AND A MODERN KITCHEN DINER 
THROUGH HERE WE'VE GOT THE KITCHEN OBVIOUSLY 
AND BREAKFAST ROOM WHICH WE'VE MADE INTO A CONSERVATORY 
THERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE DISHWASHER 
AND OVER ON THIS SIDE THERE'S GOING TO BE A FRIDGE FREEZER 
WE'VE CERAMIC TILED THE FLOOR IT'S GOING TO HAVE HEATING 
IN THE CONSERVATORY HERE AND WE'VE PUT A GLASS ROOF 
WHICH ON A NICE BRIGHT DAY IT'S NICE TO SEE THE SUN 
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THE SIZE OF THE PLOT THAT THIS SINGLE PROPERTY STOOD ON 
NOW EVEN WITH TWO HOUSES BOTH STILL HAVE A GOOD GARDEN SPACE 
INSIDE THE QUALITY OF FINISH IS HIGH WITH SOLID TIMBER DOORS 
MODERN FIXTURES AND FITTINGS AND A LOT OF NATURAL LIGHT 
ORIGINALLY ANDREW AND PHILIP THOUGHT IT WOULD COST ABOUT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TO BUILD BOTH HOUSES 
A YEAR ON HOW ARE THE NUMBERS ADDING UP 
WE'VE KEPT ROUGHLY TO THE BUDGET ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SPENT 
A LITTLE MORE PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THE HOUSES ARE LARGER 
THAN WHEN WE PURCHASED 
WE BUDGETED WE ACHIEVED THE ENHANCED PLANNING 
AND SO WE'VE HAD TO SPEND MORE TO BUILD A MUCH LARGER HOUSE BASICALLY 
UNTIL CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETE THE FINAL FIGURE WON'T BE KNOWN 
THEY PAID FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THOUSAND FOR THIS COTTAGE AT AUCTION 
AND IT'LL PROBABLY COST ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND FOR THE BUILDS 
THAT'S AN OVERALL OUTLAY OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND NOT INCLUDING FEES 
SO WHAT ARE THEY LIKELY TO MAKE ONCE THEY'RE SOLD 
I ASKED TWO LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS FOR THEIR VERDICT 
I THINK ACTUALLY 
THE VENDOR HAS LOOKED AT HIS MARKET VERY WELL 
HE'S LOOKED AT THE TYPE OF PEOPLE 
COMING INTO THE AREA HE'S MATCHED THEIR REQUIREMENTS TO WHAT HE'S BUILT 
HE'S CERTAINLY DONE HIS HOMEWORK ON THAT 
IT'S AN ATTRACTIVE LOOKING HOUSE 
I THINK IT'LL CERTAINLY APPEAL TO THE FAMILY MARKET IN THIS AREA 
THE LAYOUT IS VERY VERY GOOD THE ROOMS FLOW FROM ONE TO ANOTHER 
THE POSITION HERE IS VERY VERY GOOD AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE LOOKING AT 
A TOP LOCATION AND YOU'RE IN EASY WALKING DISTANCE OF THE RAILWAY LINE 
AND GOOD ACCESS TO THE M. FOUR 
THERE'S A REAL SHORTAGE OF THIS STYLE OF PROPERTY 
AT THE PRICE RANGE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT 
AND I FEEL THAT THIS PROPERTY WOULD CERTAINLY ATTRACT 
A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST AS WOULD THE ONE NEXT DOOR 
THINGS ARE LOOKING GOOD SO FAR 
THEY SPENT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND BUYING THE PLOT 
AND BUILDING TWO BRAND NEW FOUR BEDROOM HOUSES 
WHAT WILL THE MARKET PRICE BE FOR EACH ONE ONCE THEY'RE FINISHED 
WELL THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY 
I WOULD BRING TO THE MARKET SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF SIX HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
THE PROPERTY NEXT DOOR WHICH HAS A SLIGHTLY SMALLER PLOT 
I WOULD BRING TO THE MARKET AT FIVE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
PLOT ONE WHICH HAS THE LARGER PLOT WHICH IS THE ONE WE'RE IN NOW 
I WOULD SAY SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AND PLOT NUMBER TWO I WOULD SAY SIX HUNDRED 
OOH AN AMAZING RESULT 
WITH AN OUTLAY OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND THEY'RE LOOKING AT A PROFIT 
OF WELL OVER HALF A MILLION POUNDS EVEN AFTER COSTS ARE DEDUCTED 
THAT SHOULD PUT A SMILE ON THEIR FACES 
VERY PLEASED IT WAS WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING 
INITIALLY WHEN WE BOUGHT THE SITE OBVIOUSLY THE FIGURES WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS HIGH AS THAT 
BUT IN VIEW OF THE ENHANCED PLANNING 
WE INTEND TO GO TO THE MARKET WITH THIS ONE AT AROUND THE SIX AND A QUARTER MARK 
SO YES THAT CONFI RMED OUR OWN THOUGHTS 
ON THE NAIL 
WELL ANDREW MAY BE PLAYING IT COOL 
BUT PHILIP IS OBVIOUSLY CHUFFED AT THE RESULT 
BY DOING THEIR RESEARCH THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT MARKET TO BUILD FOR 
AND IT'S DEFINITELY PAID OFF 
OH YES IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING 
AND WE'VE ALREADY GOT ONE PROJECT TO MOVE ON TO 
AND IT WILL NOW ENABLE US TO BUY SOMETHING ELSE 
HOPEFULLY AT AUCTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE 
DRIVE DOWN THE M. THREE FROM LONDON 
AND HALFWAY BETWEEN HEATHROW AND THE ISLE OF WIGHT 
YOU WILL FIND BASINGSTOKE 
THIS TOWN WAS REBUILT IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
TO HOUSE SOME OF THE CAPITAL'S MANY COMMUTERS 
AS A PRIME LONDON OVERSPILL HOTSPOT 
BASINGSTOKE IS ON THE UP AND UP BUT IT'S ONE OF THE FEW PARTS OF THE SOUTHEAST 
WHERE YOU CAN STILL FIND THE OCCASIONAL BARGAIN 
NOW THIS IS BUCKSKIN AN AREA THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES BY THE COUNCIL 
BUT MOST OF THESE PROPERTIES ARE NOW PRIVATELY OWNED 
AND REGULARLY COME ONTO THE MARKET IN NEED OF MODERNISATION 
WHICH MEANS YOU CAN GET MORE FOR YOUR MONEY 
WELL I'M HERE TO LOOK AT THIS 
A THREE BEDROOM MID TERRACE HOUSE 
IN THE HEART OF THE ESTATE WITH A GUIDE PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT DEAL LET'S SEE IF IT'S TRUE 
THERE ARE CERTAINLY PLENTY OF THESE HOUSES AROUND HERE 
AND THEY'RE ALL VERY SIMILAR 
THAT IS WHITE TIMBER CLAD BUILDINGS WITH BITS FALLING OFF 
THIS ONE'S A PARTICULARLY GOOD EXAMPLE 
THIS MAY NOT BE THE BEST LOOKING HOUSE ON THE OUTSIDE 
BUT I LOVE THE SPACIOUS FEEL OF THE ENTRANCE 
NOW YOU'VE GOT ALL THIS CUPBOARD STORAGE THERE'S A DOWNSTAIRS TOILET 
WHICH YOU COULD CONVERT INTO A SHOWER ROOM 
AND THIS HALLWAY WELL IT'S A ROOM IN ITSELF 
NOW THE KITCHEN IS THROUGH HERE YOU COULD EXTEND TO THE BACK 
SUBJECT TO PLANNING PERMISSION 
BUT YOU CAN SEE IT'S ALL JUST TIRED AND DATED IN HERE 
FOR CENTRAL HEATING THERE ARE THESE OLD WARM AIR HEATERS 
THEY'LL NEED MODERNISING 
BUT IT'S THIS CONSERVATORY AT THE BACK 
THAT'S MADE ME PAUSE FOR BREATH IT'S NOTHING SHORT OF AN AFTERTHOUGHT 
IT'S LEAKING AND HAS SOME MAJOR DAMP PROBLEMS 
BUT AT LEAST THERE'S SOME OUTDOOR SPACE EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT MUCH 
THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THIS GARDEN IS ONLY MARGINALLY BIGGER THAN THE HALLWAY 
BUT IF YOU WANTED TO KNOCK THIS WALL DOWN AND OPEN IT UP 
IT WOULD BE A MORE FAMILY FRIENDLY SPACE 
SO DOWNSTAIRS THIS HOUSE THAT WAS GUIDED AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND HAS SOME ISSUES 
LET'S SEE IF IT GETS ANY BETTER ON THE FIRST FLOOR 
SO UPSTAIRS WE'VE GOT A BATHROOM THAT DOESN'T NEED TOO MUCH ATTENTION 
AT LEAST IT'S GOT A WHITE SUITE AND THERE ARE THREE BEDROOMS 
BUT IT JUST FEELS LIKE A WARREN OF DOORS AND LOOK 
THERE'S JUST CUPBOARDS EVERYWHERE 
THESE WINDOWS MIGHT HAVE BEEN FLOOR TO CEILING 
WHICH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT IN EXTRA LIGHT 
BUT AT SOME POINT ONE THINK THEY'VE BEEN REPLACED YOU CAN SEE HERE 
IT'S JUST A BIT CHARACTERLESS UPSTAIRS BUT THESE ARE GOOD 
SOLID SPACIOUS HOUSES THAT COULD PROVIDE A HOME FOR LIFE 
IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO BRING UP A FAMILY AND SMALL ENOUGH 
NOT TO RATTLE AROUND IN ONCE THE KIDS HAVE GROWN UP 
AND TICKING THOSE TWO BOXES IS UNUSUAL 
I'VE INVITED A LOCAL ESTATE AGENT ALONG TO TAKE A LOOK OVER THE PLACE 
WITH SIGNS OF A LOT OF WEAR AND TEAR OVER THE YEARS 
IS IT TOUGH SELLING THESE HOUSES 
THERE'S NO PROBLEMS WITH THE PROPERTY ITSELF 
IT NEEDS SOME MODERNISATION ONCE THAT'S DONE 
THERE WILL BE A MARKETPLACE FOR IT 
THE LEAN TO AT THE BACK WOULD NEED TO COME DOWN 
THE EXTENSION OF THE BACK OF THE KITCHEN POSSIBLY REMODELLED 
AS THESE DON'T COME UP VERY OFTEN 
WOULD A BUY TO LET INVESTOR BE ON TO A GOOD THING HERE 
THE RENTAL VALUE WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY PER CALENDAR MONTH 
IF THE NEW OWNER DECIDES TO COMPLETELY REFURBISH THIS HOUSE HOW MUCH COULD IT BE WORTH THEN 
REMEMBER THAT GUIDE PRICE AT AUCTION WAS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
WE WOULD EXPECT THE REFURBISHMENT VALUE TO BE SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
POSSIBLY UP TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DEPENDING WHAT'S BEEN DONE TO IT INTERNALLY 
WELL A TYPE OF HOUSE THAT'S POPULAR AND DOESN'T COME UP FOR SALE VERY OFTEN 
THIS COULD PROVE TO BE A GOOD INVESTMENT 
THE WAY THE PROPERTY MARKET HAS RISEN IN RECENT MONTHS 
TO BUY A FREEHOLD HOUSE IN AN UP AND COMING AREA LIKE THIS IS BECOMING A RARITY 
SO AT THE RIGHT PRICE THIS COULD BE A GREAT BUY 
LET'S SEE WHO PICKED IT UP AT THE AUCTION 
WE MOVE ONTO LOT FOUR 
WE MOVE DOWN TO 
BASINGSTOKE IN HAMPSHIRE 
THIS IS A THREE BEDROOM MID TERRACE HOUSE 
ON A POPULAR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT 
IT'S GUIDED ONE HUNDRED THIRTY 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO START ME ON THIS ONE YES ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YES 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY HERE NEW PLACE TAKE ONE IF IT HELPS YOU 
OTHERWISE IT'S HERE THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME 
AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
THE SECOND TIME THEN AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THIRD AND FINAL TIME 
SOLD WELL DONE 
THAT WINNING BID OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
WAS MADE BY ALEX AND HIS GIRLFRIEND NIKKI 
ALEX WORKS FOR A COMPUTER GAME PRODUCTION COMPANY 
AND MET NIKKI THROUGH A SHARED PASSION FOR ONLINE GAMING 
THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR TWO YEARS 
AND RECENTLY BEGAN SEARCHING FOR A HOUSE 
WHAT BROUGHT THEM TO BASINGSTOKE 
WE'RE BOTH LIVING IN QUITE EXPENSIVE AREAS AT THE MOMENT 
AND THERE WAS NO WAY WE COULD AFFORD TO BUY WHERE WE'RE LIVING 
SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING ROUND THIS AREA 
AND THIS COME UP FOR AUCTION AND WE THOUGHT WELL YEAH 
WE'VE SEEN HOMES UNDER THE HAMMER IT DOESN'T LOOK THAT DIFFICULT AND WE THOUGHT WE'D GIVE IT A TRY 
WERE YOU O. K. PAYING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DO YOU THINK YOU GOT A GREAT DEAL IT WAS RIGHT ON OUR LIMIT 
WE LOOKED AT IT AND WE WERE HOPING IT WAS GOING TO GO A BIT LOWER 
WE ACTUALLY PUT IN A PRE AUCTION OFFER OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
HOPING THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SNATCH IT BEFORE THE AUCTION 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY DIDN'T ACCEPT IT 
SO NIKKI AND ALEX WENT TO THEIR FIRST AUCTION 
AND PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THEIR FIRST HOUSE 
SO HOW MUCH RESEARCH DID YOU PUT INTO BUYING THIS PROPERTY 
HOURS REALLY YEAH WE CAME TO SEE IT THREE TIMES 
WE BROUGHT HIS DAD ALONG 
BECAUSE HE'S A PLUMBER AND THEN WE BROUGHT HIS MUM ALONG 
TO HAVE A LOOK AS WELL JUST GET THE FAMILY ON SIDE 
DEFINITELY LET'S BE HONEST STANDING OUTSIDE THE FRONT 
LOOKING AT THE HOUSE IT'S NOT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOUSE I'VE EVER SEEN 
HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT IT WHEN YOU FIRST CLAPPED EYES ON IT 
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED LOOKING A WHITE FRONTED HOUSE 
WAS THE LAST THING WE WANTED 
IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE DIDN'T WANT YEP 
AND THEN WE CAME INSIDE AND THERE'S JUST SO MUCH ROOM YEAH 
SO WHAT POTENTIAL CAN YOU SEE NIKKI HERE 
OH WHERE TO START THE LIVING ROOM DEFINITELY WE'VE GOT TO GET RID 
OF THE LEAN TO AT THE BACK AND TAKE THE DIVIDING WALL THERE OUT 
NICE PATIO DOORS OUT INTO THE GARDEN 
THAT'S HOW I SAW IT YOU COULD REALLY BRING THE GARDEN 
INTO THE ROOM ALMOST MAKE IT ANOTHER ROOM 
SAME WITH THE KITCHEN MERGE THE KITCHEN AND UTILITY ROOM 
TO MAKE IT A MUCH BIGGER KITCHEN DEPENDING ON THEIR PLANS NIKKI AND ALEX 
MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXTEND WITHIN THE PERMITTED DEVELOPMENT ALLOWED FOR THIS HOUSE 
ALTERNATIVELY THEY'LL NEED TO APPLY FOR PLANNING PERMISSION WHICH MEANS WAITING FOR EIGHT WEEKS 
SO WILL THIS BE YOUR FIRST HOUSE TOGETHER 
YES IT WILL 
SO IT'S A REALLY EXCITING PROJECT FOR YOU BOTH ISN'T IT OH DEFINITELY 
YEAH ARE YOU BOTH YOU KNOW 
SHARING THE SAME TASTES IN WALLPAPER AND PAINT AND CARPET 
WE TEND TO AGREE A LOT 
PRETTY MUCH IT'S BEEN GOOD HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT KNOCKING WALLS DOWN OPENING UP DOORWAYS 
NOW WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING 
YEAH THAT MIGHT BE ONE THING WE DISAGREE ON TELL ME TELL ME I LOVE IT 
GOOD GOOD BIT OF GOSSIP 
I THINK I PROBABLY WANT TO TAKE OUT SOME OF THE BUILT IN STORAGE UPSTAIRS 
THERE'S A BIG CUPBOARD THAT'S OFF THE MASTER BEDROOM 
AND THERE'S SOME OTHERS IN ANOTHER BEDROOM 
SO WHO DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO WIN ON THIS ONE 
I DON'T KNOW 
WELL WATCH THIS SPACE 
BY PAYING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AT THE AUCTION 
ALEX AND NIKKI ALMOST WENT TO THEIR LIMIT 
I HOPE THEY'VE KEPT SOME MONEY IN RESERVE FOR THE REFURBISHMENT 
SO HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU OVERALL TO GET THIS PROJECT COMPLETED 
WITH ALL OF THE KITCHEN AND THE LEAN TO AT THE BACK 
WE THINK PROBABLY THREE MONTHS 
AND WHAT SORT OF BUDGET HAVE YOU GOT TO SPEND ON THIS 
INCLUDING ALL THE FEES WE HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND LEFT OVER TO GET IT ALL DONE 
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO HERE IT IS VERY DATED 
HOW DO YOU BOTH FEEL ABOUT ARTEX BECAUSE IT'S EVERYWHERE 
YEP WE NEED TO LOOK INTO HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST TO GET THE CEILINGS SKIMMED 
IT'S NOT TOO BADLY DONE NO IT IS 
I REALLY THINK IT'S WORTH SPENDING THE MONEY TO DO THAT 
BECAUSE I JUST THINK IT REALLY SORT OF SETS THE TONE 
AND WHEN YOU'VE DECORATED IN HERE THAT'S GOING TO STICK OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB YEP 
SO WHO'S GOING TO HELP YOU DO ALL THE WORK 
MY DAD'S A PLUMBER SO HE'S GOING TO HELP US PUT IN ALL OF THE HEATING PIPES 
COS IT'S WARM AIR HEATING IN HERE AT THE MOMENT AND HE'S GOT A FRIEND WHO'S A BUILDER 
HURRAH SO HE'S GOING TO HELP US WITH THE BACK 
AND THEY'VE ALSO GOT A FRIEND WHO'S A PLASTERER HOPEFULLY 
SO WHEN I COME BACK THESE CEILINGS WILL BE BEAUTIFUL AND SMOOTH 
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW ALEX AND NIKKI GET ON DECORATING THEIR FIRST HOME 
THEY ONLY BOUGHT IT THREE WEEKS AGO 
AND NOW THEY ARE OFFICIALLY THE PROUD NEW OWNERS 
I'VE GOT SOME REALLY GOOD NEWS FOR YOU I HAD A LITTLE PHONE CALL OUTSIDE A LITTLE WHILE AGO 
AND YOU'VE COMPLETED ON THIS PROPERTY TODAY 
AND HERE ARE YOUR KEYS BRILLIANT I HOPE YOU HAVE A REALLY HAPPY TIME 
IT'S BEEN LOVELY MEETING YOU BOTH AND GOOD LUCK THANK YOU THANK YOU 
BUYING YOUR FIRST HOME IS A BIG ACHIEVEMENT 
FOR ALEX AND NIKKI IT'S THE START OF A NEW CHAPTER IN THEIR LIVES 
AND THEY'VE GOT BIG PLANS FOR THIS HOUSE 
I THINK NIKKI AND ALEX ARE REALLY EXCITED 
ABOUT CREATING THEIR FIRST HOME TOGETHER 
BUT DO THEY REALISE JUST HOW MUCH WORK IS INVOLVED 
EVEN WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY HELPING OUT 
LET'S HOPE THEY'RE STILL SMILING FURTHER DOWN THE LINE 
YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME 
WELL MAKING THE CORRECT DECISIONS ABOUT DESIGN FOR A PROPERTY 
ISN'T JUST ABOUT LIVING WITH THE WRONG PAINT COLOUR 
IT CAN AFFECT YOUR PROFIT WITH THE PROPERTY 
BUT TURNING YOUR IDEAS INTO REALITY IS GREAT FUN 
BUT HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE GET IT RIGHT LET'S CATCH UP WITH OUR PURCHASERS 
FOR SOME PROPERTY DEVELOPING COULD BE THE START OF A NEW CAREER 
BUT FOR SWIMMING TEACHER AND SINGLE PARENT RUTH 
IT WAS JUST AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPLEMENT HER INCOME 
AND PICK UP SOME NEW SKILLS SHE'D ALREADY TAKEN COURSES IN PLUMBING PLASTERING AND JOINERY 
SO WAS CONFIDENT THAT ALONG WITH HER FRIEND SALLY 
SHE COULD RENOVATE THIS TWO BEDROOM HOUSE IN DERBY WITH NO OUTSIDE HELP 
FIVE MONTHS ON IT APPEARS SHE'S DONE JUST THAT 
SISTERS ARE DOING IT FOR THEMSELVES 
STANDING ON THEIR OWN TWO FEET 
AND RINGING ON THEIR OWN BELLS 
THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS VERY DAMP 
WE HAD TO TAKE THE WALLS FROM ABOUT RADIATOR HEIGHT DOWN 
RIP ALL THE PLASTERWORK OFF AND THE OLD RENDERING 
RIGHT BACK TO BARE BRICK 
WE'VE HAD THE WHOLE HOUSE REWIRED RE RENDER ALL DOWNSTAIRS 
WE'VE HAD PARTLY SOME NEW WINDOWS AND THE PATIO DOORS 
BASICALLY EVERYTHING 
SISTERS ARE DOING IT FOR THEMSELVES 
BOTH SALLY AND RUTH HAVE FULL TIME JOBS 
BUT BY WORKING EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS 
THEY'VE TRANSFORMED THIS HOUSE AND MADE SOME BIG IMPROVEMENTS 
THE MAIN CHANGE IS THE FRENCH DOORS WE HAD FRENCH DOORS PUT IN 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THERE WAS AN OLD FASHIONED WINDOW 
SO THAT WAS RIPPED OUT AND BRAND NEW FRENCH DOORS 
AND A NICE WINDOW ABOVE TO GIVE MORE LIGHT 
AND WE'VE KNOCKED THROUGH THE WALL FROM THE DINING ROOM TO THE KITCHEN 
TO MAKE A BIG KITCHEN DINING AREA 
AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN HERE IS STRIPPED THE FLOORS BACK 
TO THE ORIGINAL FLOORBOARDS COS THEY WERE IN REALLY GOOD CONDITION 
NEW ELECTRICS RADIATOR WE'VE CLEANED UP THE WINDOWS 
SISTERS ARE DOING IT FOR THEMSELVES 
IT'S GOOD TO SEE THAT THAT TREE AT THE FRONT HAS BEEN REMOVED 
BUT BY FAR THE BIGGEST CHANGE OUTSIDE IS AT THE BACK 
WHERE RUTH HAS UNCOVERED A MUCH BIGGER GARDEN THAN SHE'D EXPECTED 
BASICALLY THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS KNOCK DOWN THE GREENHOUSE 
OPENED UP THE WHOLE GARDEN BY CHOPPING DOWN LOTS OF BUSHES AND TREES 
AND THORNS THISTLES AND LITERALLY DOUBLED THE SIZE OF THE GARDEN 
THERE WAS LOTS OF POTENTIAL TO EXTEND THIS PROPERTY 
NOT JUST OUT THE BACK BUT BY GOING INTO THE LOFT SPACE AS WELL 
BUT THE GIRLS DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT 
YEAH WE WERE THINKING ABOUT EXTENDING INTO THE LOFT 
BUT JUST HAVEN'T GOT THE FUNDS TO DO THAT 
THE PEOPLE WHO BUY IT HAVE GOT THAT CHOICE 
COS IT CAN BE DONE BUT IT WOULD'VE TAKEN EVEN LONGER AS WELL 
AND WE WANT A QUICK YOU KNOW A QUICK TURNAROUND 
AS THE BUDGET WAS JUST SEVEN THOUSAND TO EIGHT THOUSAND 
BUILDING AN EXTENSION WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION 
BUT BY DOING A LOT OF THE RENOVATION WORK HERSELF 
RUTH WAS HOPING TO KEEP THE COSTS DOWN 
DID SHE MANAGE TO STICK TO HER ORIGINAL BUDGET 
THE BUDGET'S GONE UP TO JUST UNDER TEN THOUSAND NOW 
BASICALLY A LOT OF IT WAS TO DO WITH THE GAS 
BECAUSE WE HADN'T GOT ANY GAS IN THE HOUSE WE THOUGHT WE HAD 
IT WAS CHECKED AND THEN FOUND TO HAVE NO GAS SO THAT WAS ADDED EXPENSE 
WITH THE HOUSE ALMOST FINISHED I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE MORE FURNISHINGS 
RUTH'S ORIGINAL PLAN WAS TO MOVE IN SO WHAT'S CHANGED 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE IN THE HOUSE IS JUST TOO FAR FROM MY DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL 
IT'S TOO FAR FOR HER TO WALK AND SHE DOESN'T WANT ME AT FIFTEEN 
TO BE TAKING HER TO SCHOOL AND PICKING HER UP EVERY DAY 
SO THE PLAN IS TO HOPEFULLY SELL IT QUICKLY 
AND THE NEXT HOUSE WE BUY HOPEFULLY AT AUCTION 
WE'LL DO IT UP AND MOVE INTO THAT ONE 
ALONG WITH SALLY'S HELP RUTH'S WORKED VERY HARD 
TO RENOVATE THIS PROPERTY AND MADE THE BEST OF THE SPACE AVAILABLE 
WITHOUT TAKING EXTREME MEASURES SHE PAID ONE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND FOR IT AT AUCTION 
AND SPENT TEN THOUSAND TURNING IT AROUND 
BUT WOULD SHE HAVE MADE MORE BY EXTENDING 
OR WILL TWO LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS THINK SHE'S DONE ENOUGH 
THE PROGRAMME OF WORKS THAT THE OWNERS HAVE DONE 
IS FABULOUS AND THE COLOUR SCHEMES THE CHANGES IN KITCHEN 
THE REMOVAL OF THE WALL IN THAT AREA 
ALL GOES TO CREATE A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT 
I UNDERSTAND THE LADIES HAD THOUGHT ABOUT EXTENDING THE PROPERTY 
BUT I'M GLAD THAT THEY HAVEN'T 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH IT 
THIS IS A TWO BEDROOM HOUSE IT IS WHAT IT IS 
LEAVE IT AS IT IS AND MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ONE I THINK 
THE ONE MAJOR CONCERN WHEN THEY COME TO RESELL THE PROPERTY 
WILL BE THE ORIGINAL WINDOWS AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
THEY LOOK DATED DON'T GIVE A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION 
AND ALTHOUGH CHANGING BAY WINDOWS IS EXPENSIVE IT REALLY WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE 
THE WAY THEY HAVE DEALT WITH THE KITCHEN DINER IS VERY GOOD AS IT'S A GALLEY KITCHEN 
AND THE WAY THEY'VE OPENED IT UP FROM THE DINING ROOM IT MAKES IT FLOW THROUGH 
AND ALTHOUGH IT IS QUITE NARROW IT DOESN'T SEEM NARROW NOW 
THEY'VE ALSO BROUGHT MORE LIGHT INTO THE ROOM WITH THE FRENCH DOORS AT THE BACK 
AND THE GLASS PANEL THAT THEY PUT IN WHERE THE DOOR WAS IS A NICE TOUCH 
WITH ANOTHER PROPERTY ON THE HORIZON 
RENTING THIS ONE OUT WAS NEVER AN OPTION 
SO AFTER SPENDING ONE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND ON IT AT AUCTION 
AND ANOTHER TEN GRAND FOR THE RENOVATIONS 
HOW MUCH HAS RUTH MADE FOR HER FIVE MONTHS WORK 
THE VALUE AS IT STANDS AT THE MOMENT IS LIKELY TO BE AROUND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
IF I WAS TO PUT THE PROPERTY ON THE MARKET NOW 
I WOULD SUGGEST IT SHOULD GO ON AT ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
I WAS EXPECTING A BIT MORE THAN THAT 
WE HAD A VALUATION YESTERDAY 
AND THE VALUATION WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
HE SAID WE COULD EVEN GET MORE THAN THAT BUT FOR A QUICK SALE 
PUT IT ON FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
SO THAT'S QUITE A LOT LESS THAN I WAS EXPECTING 
ONCE COSTS HAVE BEEN DEDUCTED THAT WOULD LEAVE RUTH 
WITH A PROFIT OF ONLY ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND OR EIGHT THOUSAND 
NOT BAD BUT THEY WERE HOPING FOR A LOT MORE 
HAVE THEY BEEN PUT OFF GOING BACK TO THE AUCTION AND DOING IT ALL AGAIN 
NO NOT PUT OFF JUST GETTING READY TO DO THE NEXT ONE 
IF ANYTHING I'D SAY THEY'RE KEENER THAN EVER 
AND WITH RUTH PICKING UP MORE AND MORE SKILLS 
WHO KNOWS NEXT TIME SHE MAY DO THE WHOLE HOUSE HERSELF 
THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF THESE WHITE TIMBER CLAD PROPERTIES 
AROUND THIS PART OF BASINGSTOKE THIS ONE WAS BOUGHT AT AUCTION 
FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BY NIKKI AND ALEX TO BE THEIR FIRST HOME TOGETHER 
THE HOUSE WAS VERY SPACIOUS BUT DOWNSTAIRS IT NEEDED SERIOUS REFURBISHMENT 
A GROTTY LEAN TO AT THE BACK WAS ROTTEN AND DAMP 
AND THERE WAS DEFINITELY ONE THING I WAS ADAMANT HAD TO GO 
HOW DO YOU BOTH FEEL ABOUT ARTEX IT'S NOT TOO BADLY DONE 
NO IT IS 
WHEN YOU'VE DECORATED IN HERE THAT'S GOING TO STICK OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB YEP 
SIX MONTHS LATER LET'S SEE WHAT'S BEEN ACHIEVED 
THE LARGE HALLWAY HAS SEEN A SPLASH OF PAINT 
BUT BEHIND IT THAT OLD KITCHEN IS JUST AS BAD AS BEFORE 
AND THE LOUNGE 
HOORAY THE LEAN TO HAS GONE 
AND THE ARTEX 
UPSTAIRS THE MIDDLE SIZED BEDROOM HAS BEEN DECORATED 
AND LOOKS READY TO SLEEP IN 
THE COLOUR SCHEME OF BEDROOM THREE HAS ALSO CHANGED 
BUT THE REALLY LARGE BEDROOM HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO TWO SMALLER ROOMS 
SO THE HOUSE IS NOW POTENTIALLY A FOUR BEDROOM PROPERTY 
HOW HAS ALEX GOT ON WITH HIS AND NIKKI'S FIRST HOME 
HAS IT GONE TO PLAN 
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE PROPERTY FOR FIVE MONTHS SO FAR 
AND WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS BUT IT'S TAKEN A LOT LONGER THAN WE'D REALLY HOPED IT WOULD 
THE OLD SUNROOM AT THE BACK IT REALLY WASN'T VERY GOOD 
IT LEAKED AND REALLY WE JUST DECIDED THAT AFTER LOOKING AT THE ECONOMICS 
OF WHETHER TO REBUILD IT OR NOT WE JUST HAD TO PULL IT DOWN 
ALONG WITH THE TREES IN THE BACK GARDEN 
THE LEAKY LEAN TO WAS KNOCKED DOWN AND HUNG OUT TO DRY 
MORE A RAINY ROOM THAN A SUNTRAP AS NIKKI EXPLAINS 
THIS USED TO BE THE RAIN ROOM AS YOU CAN SEE IT ISN'T ANY MORE 
WE DECIDED THAT WITH THE POTENTIAL PLANNING PERMISSION THAT WE'D HAVE NEEDED 
WE'VE GOT THE NEW PATIO DOORS IN THE EXTENSION FOR THE KITCHEN 
WE REALLY DIDN'T NEED THE EXTRA INDOOR SPACE 
I THINK I CAN USE IT MUCH BETTER OUT HERE AS SOMEWHERE TO ENTERTAIN 
PUT A NICE PATIO IN MOVE THE BARBEQUE IN AND IT SHOULD BE NICE 
NIKKI AND ALEX HAD TOYED WITH TAKING THE BRICK EXTENSION RIGHT ACROSS THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
BUT DIDN'T THINK THEY'VE RECOUP THE INVESTMENT IF THEY CAME TO SELL 
AND THERE'S PLENTY OF WORK NEEDED ON THE EXISTING EXTENSION 
AT THE MOMENT THE EXTENSION'S ONLY A SINGLE SKIN 
SO WE'RE HAVING A SECOND SKIN PUT UP ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE EXTENSION 
WE'RE REPAIRING THE ROOF BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S GOT TWO ROOFS ON IT 
AND ONE OF THEM IS NOT VERY GOOD AND WE'RE LEVELLING THE FLOOR 
THE NEW KITCHEN WILL OPEN RIGHT INTO THE EXTENSION ALL AT THE SAME LEVEL 
IT SHOULD BE A BIG ROOM 
WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE SINK IN WHERE THE EXTENSION IS 
AND THE WASHING MACHINE AND THEN IT'S GOING TO COME ROUND IN A BIG U. 
SO THE COOKER'S GOING TO STAY PRETTY MUCH WHERE IT IS 
IT'LL GIVE US A LOT MORE STORAGE SPACE 
AND IT SHOULD LOOK NICE WITH MY NICE NEW HUGE FRIDGE 
YES NIKKI'S BOUGHT A BIG AMERICAN STYLE FRIDGE 
IT LOOKS A BIT LONELY BEFORE THE REST OF THE KITCHEN IS THERE TO JOIN IT 
THE BIGGEST JOB SO FAR HAS BEEN PUTTING IN THE CENTRAL HEATING 
IT'S MEANT WE'VE HAD TO TAKE UP ALL THE FLOORS UPSTAIRS 
AND THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WANT THE PIPE WORK TO GO SO WE CAN KEEP IT AS HIDDEN AS POSSIBLE 
CHANGING THE WARM AIR HEATERS TO RADIATORS WASN'T EASY 
BUT WELL WORTH IT I RECKON 
MOST OF THE PIPES HAVE BEEN HIDDEN 
AND NIKKI HASN'T HAD TO SACRIFICE ANY OF HER CUPBOARD SPACE 
I WON ON THE STORAGE AT THE MOMENT 
WE DECIDED THAT IT WAS TOO MUCH HASSLE 
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE GOING ON TO START RIPPING OUT CUPBOARDS AND REMODELLING THEM 
THEY PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AT AUCTION FOR A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE 
BUT AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION IT LOOKS LIKE IT WASN'T ORIGINALLY BUILT THAT WAY 
WHEN WE GOT THE HOUSE THIS WAS ONE LARGE BEDROOM 
BUT IT ALREADY HAD THE SEPARATE DOORFRAME AND THE SEPARATE WINDOW 
SO WE THINK IT WAS ORIGINALLY TWO SEPARATE ROOMS 
SO WE PUT THE STUD WALL BACK AND IT GIVES ME AN OFFICE 
WHERE I CAN WORK AND IT ALSO GIVES NIKKI SOME SPACE 
WHERE SHE CAN DO HER OWN THING 
THE PREVIOUS OWNERS HAD RECENTLY REFURBISHED THE BATHROOM 
SO THAT HASN'T BEEN CHANGED IT'S JUST AS WELL NIKKI AND ALEX HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S A PLASTERER 
SOME SEAMS WERE SO CRACKED THAT THE PLASTERBOARD HAD TO BE TOTALLY REPLACED 
SO WITH LOTS OF WORK STILL TO DO HOW'S THE FINANCIAL POSITION 
I THINK WE'RE DOING WELL ON THE BUDGET 
WE HAD A BUDGET OF TEN THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
AND WE'VE SPENT SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SO FAR 
AS TO THE REMAINING BUDGET ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND MAXIMUM SHOULD DO IT 
NIKKI AND ALEX HAD ORIGINALLY ALLOWED FIVE THOUSAND FOR THE EXTENSION 
SO WHEN THEY SHELVED THAT PLAN 
THE BUDGET DROPPED FROM FIFTEEN THOUSAND TO TEN THOUSAND 
LET'S HEAR WHAT TWO LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS THINK OF THE HOUSE 
AND WHAT IT COULD BE WORTH WHEN THE WORK'S FINISHED 
I UNDERSTAND THEIR PLANS 
ARE TO SLIGHTLY EXTEND THE KITCHEN OUT INTO 
THE SINGLE SKINNED AREA AT THE BACK THERE'S A WAY TO GO YET 
BUT YOU CAN SEE THE FINISH THEY'LL END UP WITH 
SO THAT'S GOING TO WORK OUT WELL FOR THEM 
I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED THE VALUE 
BY SPLITTING THE BEDROOMS INTO FOUR AS A FOUR BEDROOM 
IT'S LIKELY TO ATTRACT A FAMILY AS A THREE BEDROOM A FIRST TIME BUYER 
THEY INSTALLED A RADIATOR HEATING SYSTEM AFTER REMOVING THE WARM AIR SYSTEM 
IT'S FAR MORE ECONOMICAL AND THE PERFECT THING FOR THIS PROPERTY 
HOW MUCH COULD IT BE WORTH IF NIKKI AND ALEX DECIDE TO SELL 
REMEMBER THEY PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AT AUCTION FOR THE HOUSE 
AND SPENT ABOUT TEN THOUSAND ON THE REFURBISHMENT 
IF THE PROPERTY CAME BACK ONTO THE MARKET ONCE IT WAS FINISHED 
WE'D EXPECT IT TO BE WORTH BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND 
IF WE WERE MARKETING THIS PROPERTY IN A FINISHED CONDITION WE'D RECOMMEND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THAT'S ABOUT WHAT OUR RESEARCH SHOWED 
WE PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND WITH A BUDGET OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND 
THAT WORKS OUT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SO AROUND FIFTEEN THOUSAND PROFIT 
HANG ON ALEX 
DON'T FORGET THAT FIGURE WOULD BE SEVERELY DENTED 
BY THE USUAL DEDUCTIONS IF YOU DID DECIDE TO SELL 
BUT I RECKON THEY'RE GOING TO STAY AND ENJOY THIS NEW HOUSE 
AND I BET THEY'RE PLEASED THAT I CONVINCED THEM TO GET RID OF THAT ARTEX 
OH YES YES 
IT WOULDN'T HAVE SUITED THE REST OF THE HOUSE 
THERE'S NO POINT MAKING THE REST OF IT NICE WHEN YOU'VE GOT THAT ON THE CEILING 
I DON'T THINK YOU'D HAVE FORGIVEN US IF WE'D KEPT IT 
NO YOU'RE RIGHT IT HAD TO GO 
WE WISH NIKKI AND ALEX LOTS OF LUCK WITH THEIR NEW HOUSE 
AND HERE'S TO THAT FABULOUS KITCHEN THEY'RE PLANNING 
LET'S HOPE IT WORKS OUT WELL FOR THEM 
PROPERTIES ARE GOING UNDER THE HAMMER VIRTUALLY EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK 
SO WE REALLY ARE SPOILT FOR CHOICE 
YES AND YOU SHOULD JOIN US NEXT TIME FOR MORE AUCTION STORIES SEE YOU THEN GOODBYE
