TREASURE LYING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
SEA IN WEATHER ANOTHER DAY OF 
HEAVY SHOWERS SOME WITH HAIL 
THUNDER EMBEDDED IN THEM 
TEMPERATURES UP A WEE BIT ON 
YESTERDAY GOOD MORNING TO YOU THE 
PARENTS OF MADELEINE MCCANN HAVE 
TOLD THE B. B. C. THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN UP 
HOPE OF FINDING THEIR DAUGHTER 
ALIVE KATE AND GERRY MCCANN HAVE 
MADE AN APPEAL JUST BEFORE THE 
FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF MADELEINE'S 
DISAPPEARANCE THEY HAVE SPOKEN 
ABOUT HOW THEY KEEP THE CASE IN THE 
PUBLIC EYE 
WHAT KEEPS THE HOPE IN 
PLACE THAT SHE IS ALIVE 
NUMBER ONE 
MADELEINE IS SO IMPORTANT TO US 
NUMBER TWO THERE IS NO EVIDENCE 
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY 
HARM HAS COME TO HER THREE IF YOU 
LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE THE STATES 
WHERE THEY HAVE A LOT OF STATISTICS 
RELATING TO THIS TYPE OF CRIME 
CHILDREN ARE RECOVERED A LOT OF 
CHILDREN ARE RECOVERED THE YOUNGER 
THE CHILD THE BETTER THE CHANCE OF 
THAT 
THEY WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT THAT ONE OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AIMS NOW IS 
TO PROMOTE A EUROPE WIDE ALERT 
SCHEME FOR MISSING CHILDREN EVEN EVEN ON THE NIGHT THEY WERE SAYING THINK 
THINGS LIKE HAVE THE BORDERS BEEN 
ALERTED PORTS YOUR WORRY IS THAT 
CHILD IS GOING TO BE MOVED QUICKLY 
AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRIME 
KATE AND GERRY ARE STILL OFFICIAL 
SUSPECTS LT 
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW 
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WHAT HASN'T 
BEEN DONE WHO HAS BEEN ELIMINATED 
AND WHAT THEY FOLLOW 
I THINK THE 
KEY THING HERE IS IT IS A HORRIFIC 
CRIME AGAINST A YOUNG CHILD L. 
THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT 
MADELEINE IS STILL MISSING A 
HIDEOUS CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED 
AND THAT PERSON IS STILL OUT THERE 
WHAT THE MCCANNS HOPE IS THE 
INTENSE MEDIA PRESSURE ON THEM WILL 
SUBSIDE AFTER THE ANNIVERSARY 
ALLOWING THEM TO FOCUS AGAIN ON THE 
ONLY THING THAT MATTERS 
WE WILL 
NEVER GIVE UP ON MADELEINE L. WANT 
MADELEINE BACK WE NEED TO FIND 
MADELEINE THAT IS WHAT KEEPS US 
GOING 
THERE IS A NEW PHONE LINE GOING NUMBER SO IF YOU HAVE ANY 
INFORMATION ABOUT MADELEINE MCCANN 
WE WILL SPEAK TO KATE AND GERRY 
MCCANN HERE ON THE SOFA AFTER 
EIGHT ZERO ZERO A M. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS 
KEEP THEM COMING IN THE NUMBER OF 
YOUNGER WOMEN DIE FROM HEART 
DISEASE COULD BE ON THE INCREASE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES 
RESEARCHERS WARN UNHEALTHY 
LIFESTYLES COULD BE TO BLAME 
EXERCISE IS VITAL IN THE BATTLE 
AGAINST HEART DISEASE ALONG WITH A 
GOOD DIET FOR YEARS THIS HEALTH 
MESSAGE HAS BEEN TARGETED AT HIGH 
RISK GROUPS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
DIE FROM THE DISEASE PEEKED IN THE 
NINETEEN SEVENTIES SINCE THEN NUMBERS HAVE 
FALLEN THE FIGURES FOR WOMEN UNDER 
FIFTY HAVE NOW LEVELLED OFF EXPERT S. 
WARN MAY EVEN BE REVERSING THE 
REPORT AUTHORS SAY ALTHOUGH 
SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES HAVE BEEN MADE 
IN REDUCING DEATHS FROM HEART 
DISEASE IN OLDER POPULATIONS THE 
SAME IS NOT HAPPENING IN THE UNDER 
FIFTIES THEY WARN THAT IS DISTURBING 
WITH THE AGE GROUPS WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT IT IS FIVE TO TEN PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
PEOPLE THE RISK IS NOT HIGH IN 
THESE AGE GROUPS AS THEY GET OLDER 
IF TRENDS ARE REPLICATED WE WILL 
HAVE BIG PROBLEMS HEART DISEASE IS 
STILL THE BIGGEST KILLER IN THE U. K. 
OBESITY IS A BIG FACTOR ALONG WITH 
DIABETES SMOKING AND A LACK OF 
EXERCISE IF THIS TREND IN YOUNGER 
WOMEN IS NOT REVERSED HEART 
DISEASE WILL BECOME AN INTENSING 
BURDEN ON THE N. H. S. 
ZIMBABWE COULD BE PLUNGED INTO MORE 
POLITICAL TURMOIL IT IS EXPECTED 
OFFICIALS WILL CALL FOR ZIMBABWEANS 
TO GO BACK TO THE POLLS GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS ROBERT MUGABE DID LOSE 
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION A MONTH 
AGO BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REMOVE HIM 
FROM POWER IF TRUE IT WILL GO TO A 
RUN OFF BETWEEN MR. MUGABE AND THE 
OPPOSITION LEADER FIVE PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN KILLED AND NINE INJURED AFTER 
A SMALL BOAT AND NISHING TRAWLER 
COLLIDED IN SYDNEY HARBOUR ALL 
THOSE KILLED OR INJURED WERE IN THE 
SMALLER VESSEL 
FOURTEEN GIRLS AT A SCHOOL IN BRUM HAVE 
TESTED POSITIVE FOR TUBERCULOSIS 
SIXTEEN FURTHER PUPILS AT THE SCHOOL ARE 
TO UNDERGO FURTHER TESTING AFTER 
RESULTS INDICATED THEY MAY HAVE THE 
DISEASE THERE IS LITTLE RISK OF IT 
SPREADING TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC 
MOST OF THE CHILDREN FATHERED BY 
THE FATHER WHO RAPED HIS SAY 
JOSEF FRITZL IS REFUSING TO ANSWER 
QUESTIONS NATASCHA KAMPUSCH WHO 
WAS KIDNAPPED IN SIMILAR 
CIRCUMSTANCES HAS TOLD THE BOB SHE 
BELIEVES THE CHILDREN CAN RECOVER 
THE CHILLING SIGHT OF JOSEF FRITZL 
INDULGING HIMSELF WHEN HIS FAMILY 
SUFFERED HIS DAUGHTER ELISABETH 
AND SOME OF HER CHILDREN WERE 
PRISONERS IN HIS BASEMENT NOW IN 
POLICE CUSTODY HE IS REFUSING TO 
ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY 
HIS VICTIMS ARE BEING TREATED IN 
THIS PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC THEIR 
ORDEAL UNIMAGINABLE FOR ONE 
AUSTRIAN WOMAN FAMILIAR NATASCHA 
KAMPUSCH WAS ALSO HELD UNDERGROUND 
WHEN SHE ESCAPED AFTER MORE THAN 
EIGHT YEARS 
LITTLE BY LITTLE I 
REALISED THERE WERE PARALLELS TO MY 
OWN FATE SO THEN THE WHOLE STORY 
AFFECTED ME EVEN MORE 
SHE SAYS HER 
WINDOWLESS PRISON WILL STAY WITH 
HER FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE JOSEF 
FRITZL'S CAPTIVES ENDURED SIMILAR 
CONDITIONS BUT FOR THEM NATASCHA 
KAMPUSCH SEES HOPE AND HAS STARTED 
A FUND TO HELP THEM 
I WISH THE FAMILY THE BEST OF LUCK 
AND HOPE THAT THEY WILL PULL 
THROUGH I THINK THAT AT LEAST THE 
YOUNGEST ONES WILL SUCCEED 
AT THE 
HOUSE WHERE THEY WERE HELD THE 
POLICE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES NOW 
IT IS WIDENING DETECTIVES ARE 
EXAMINING UNSOLVED COIMS ELSEWHERE 
IN AUSTRIA TO SEE IF JOSEF FRITZL 
WAS INVOLVED THERE MAY BE MORE

ENVIRONMENT POLICING AND THE

THAT COULD BE GOLD PLATED LITERALLY 
YOU CAN NOW BUY A SHARE IN TEN 
MILLION WORTH OF BULLION THAT 
COULD ONLY COST FIFTY THE ONLY 
PROBLEM IS THE GOLD IS LYING AT THE 
BOTTOM OF THE SEA CHRIS BUCKLER 
CAN TELL US MORE 
YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME INDUSTRY 
ALONG THE DOCKS HERE IN BELFAST A 
CENTURY AGO THIS WAS MAJOR CENTRE 
FOR SHIP BUILDING THE TITANIC CAME 
FROM HERE ANOTHER SHIP IN THE 
WHITE STAR LINE WAS THE LAURENTIC 
IT IS JUST AS INTERESTING A STORY 
TO TELL IT WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT TO 
CARRY PASSENGERS THEN IT WAS ASKED 
TO RRY GOLD AS PART OF THE WAR 
EFFORT THE PROBLEM FOR THE 
LAURENTIC WAS IT ENDED UP HITTING 
MINES AND ALL THE FORTUNE WENT INTO 
THE WATER ALONG WITH THE SHIP 
ITSELF ITSELF THE LAURENTIC LIES FORTY METRES BELOW 
THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND SHE 
STILL HOLDS THE PROSPECT OF GOLD 
WHEN THE SHIP SANK OFF THE NORTH 
COAST OF IRELAND IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN SHE WAS 
CARRYING MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND GOLD BARS 
TWO HUNDRED SIX THEM HAVE NEVER BEEN RECOVERED 
TWENTY OF THEM HAVE NEVER BEEN 
RECOVERED PEOPLE WERE GIVEN THE 
CHANCE TO BUY SHARES IN THE WRECK 
THOUGH THERE'S LITTLE HOPE OF EVER 
FINDING THAT REMAINING TEN MILLION 
FORTUNE IN GOLD BULLION 
IT'S NOT 
AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY THOUGH 
LOOKING AT THE PRICES OF HOUSES 
THESE DAYS IT MIGHTN'T BE A BAD ONE 
IT'S A BIT OF FUN IT'S HISTORY 
IT'S A CHANCE TO BUY INTO A DREAM 
TO ACTUALLY OWN A PART OF A WHITE 
STAR LINEER TO OWN A BULLION SHIP 
IT WAS BUILT TO BE A PASSENGER 
LINER BUT SHE WAS DRAFTED IN TO 
PLAY A PART IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
EFFORT THE GOLD BULLION WAS BEING 
TAKEN TO CANADA TO PAY FOR 
MUNITIONS WHEN SHE HIT MINES 
THERE WAS DREADFUL LOSS OF LIFE 
AND THE GOLD WENT DOWN WITH THE 
SHIP IN LESS THAN DECADE THE 
ROYAL NAVY DIVERS RECOVERED ALMOST 
ALL OF IT THE SALVAGE EFFORT WAS 
USED TO CREATE DECOMPRESSION TABLES 
STILL USED 
THE DIVING EQUIPMENT 
ITSELF THE WEIGHT ALONE FOR A 
DIVER TO BE WALKING ALONG THE SEA 
BED WITH LARGE BOOTS AND A HELMET 
AND THE WAY IT'S BEEN USED IT'S 
INCREDIBLE IN ITSELF 
AT LOUGH 
SWILLY IT STILL ATTRACTS DIVERS 
RECENTLY THEY RECOVERED A GUN 
WHICH THEY PLAN TO PLACE AT THE 
LOCH 
THE BOW IS STILL IN TACT AND LOCH THE REST OF THE LAURENTIC IS STILL 
SCRAP YARD STILL EVERY DIVERS 
DREAM TO DIVE IT YOU HAVE THAT 
BUZZ ON THAT FEELINGS IT'S 
INCREDIBLE TO BE ON IT 
UNDER WATER 
THE GOLD IS NOT THE ONLY ATTRACTION 
JUST A PART OF THE LAURENTIC'S RICH 
HISTORY STILL BEING EXPLORED 
GREAT SHOTS FROM UNDER WATER THERE 
AND A REAL SENSE OF THAT SHIP THE 
ONLY THING IS THAT'S PROBABLY AS 
CLOSE AS YOU'LL GET TO THE GOLD 
THE FAMILY WHO OWN THE LAURENTIC 
ARE TRYING TO APPEAL TO ENTHUSIASTS 
THEY'RE GIVING AWAY A D. V. D. OF SOME 
OF THAT FOOTAGE AND AUDIO C. D.'S AND 
DETAILS OF JUST THE LAURENTIC 
ITSELF AS FOR THE GOLD BULLION 
YOU WON'T FIND OF THAT IN THE SHARE

GOALS BEFORE THE IMPLICATIONS IT 
FINISHED ONE TO ONE IN NORMAL TIME 
CHELSEA WENT AHEAD WITH DIDIER 
DROGBA REACTING WELL LIVERPOOL 
LEVELLED THE TIE ON THE NIGHT AND 
ON AGGREGATE WHEN FERNANDO TORRES 
WAS PLAYED THROUGH TO EQUALISE 
INTO EXTRA TIME AND THEN THE 
EMOTIONAL MOMENT OF THE NIGHT 
FRANK LAMPARD SCORED A PENALTY 
THAT DAYS AFTER HIS MOTHER DOID 
FROM PNEUMONIA HIS FATHER WAS 
WATCHING FOUR MINUTES LATER 
NICOLAS ANELKA SET UP DROGBA BABEL 
DID PULL A GOAL BACK BUT IT IS 
CHELSEA WHO ARE MOSCOW BOUND 
TO HANDLE THE DIFFICULT DAYS IT IS 
VERY IMPORTANT FOR THIS CLUB L. 
FIGHT FOR THE CHAMPIONS 
WHEN WE SCORED THE GOAL I WAS 
REALLY PLEASED A LOT OF CONFIDENT 
THINKING THINKING WE COULD 
PROGRESS NOW THINK ABOUT THE 
FUTURE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE NOW 
OF COURSE FINGERS CROSSED TONIGHT 
WE ARE HOPING THAT RANGERS WILL GET 
TO THE UEFA CUP FINAL THAT WILL BE 
STAGED AT MANCHESTER STADIUM THEY 
TAKE ON FIORENTINA TONIGHT 
WALTER SMITH'S SIDE HAVE TRAVELLED 
TO FLORENCE KNOWING THAT IF THEY

TWICE THEY'RE HOPING THAT DAVID 
WEIR WILL BE FIT AFTER PICKING UP A 
GROIN INJURY AGAINST CELTIC ON 
YOUR CAREER YOU CAN LOOK SUNDAY FORWARD TO THE EUROPEAN FINAL I'VE 
HAD A COUPLE OF OPPORTUNITIES 
BEFORE BUT THEY HAVE PASSED US BY 
SO HOPEFULLY THIS ONE WILL NOT PASS 
US BY BOTH THE TEAMS THAT ARE HERE 
HAVE PLAYED A LOT OF GAMES TO TO 
THIS STAGE EACH WILL THINK THEY 
DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO 
THE FINAL 
AWAY FROM THE FOOTBALL THE SNOOKER 
FANS HAVE GOT THE SEMI FINAL THEY 
WANTED RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AGAINST 
SEVEN HENDRY AT THE CRUISABLE HE 
NEEDED TWO FRAMES TO BOOK HIS PLACE 
IN THE LAST FOUR HE WON THE LAST 
OF HIS TITLES BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE HE 
DIDN'T TAKE TOO LONG TO WRAP UP THE 
MATCH BY THIRTEEN FRAMES TO SEVEN 
O'SULLIVAN LAST CLAIMED THE TITLE 
I. N. TWO THOUSAND FOUR CHINA'S LIANG WENBO KEPT 
IT CLOSE IN THE EARLY STAGES 
O'SULLIVAN'S GREATER EXPERIENCE 
TOLD IN THE END HE IS NOW LOOKING 
FORWARD TO THE CLASH WITH HENDRY IN 
THE LATER STAGES OF ANOTHER WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
WHO EVER COMES HERE CHAMPIONSHIP WANTS TO WIN THIS TORNMENT MORE 
THAN ANY OTHER IT IS LIKE ANY 
OTHER TORNMENT THE MAN WHO 
PRODUCES THE BEST FORM INVARIABLY 
WILL WIN OBVIOUSLY THERE IS MORE 
TENSION AND PRESSURE HERE MAYBE 
THAT IS WHY YOU GET YOU NEVER 
REALLY GET MANY FLUKEY WINNERS YOU 
KNOW WHAT I MEAN EVERYBODY IS HERE 
TO WIN SEMI FINALS IT IS JUST 
BEGINNING 
AND THE OTHER SEMI FINAL BEGINNING BETWEEN CARTER KARTD AND JOE PERRY 
CARTER COMPLETED A THIRTEEN TO NINE WIN OVER 
FORMER CHAMPION PETER EBDON PERRY 
WAS TAKEN ALL THE WAY BY KEVIN 
MAGUIRE IT WENT TO A TWENTY FIFTH AND 
DECIDING FRAME AND PERRY CLINCHED 
THE MATCH WITH A BREAK OF FIFTY FOUR TO 
REACH THE LAST FOUR THERE ARE 
CHELSEA FANS MAKING THEIR WAY HOME 
OR TO WORK WE ARE NOT SURE ABOUT 
THAT HANGING AROUND ALL NIGHT 
WAITING TO SEE YOU THAT IS WHAT 
THEY WERE DOING 
YOU THINK SO 
SEE YOU LATER FORGET PEOPLE 
STEALING YOUR PIN NUMBER OR CLONING 
YOUR CREDIT CARD YOU ARE ABOUT TO 
HEAR ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH IS THE 
BIGGEST FRAUD ISSUE AFFECTING THE 
U. K. IT ALL BEGINS WITH YOU 
RECEIVING A PHONE CALL SOMEBODY 
PHONES UP CLAIMING TO BE A 
STOCKBROKER AND CONS YOU IT IS 
CALLED BOILER ROOM FRAUD B. B. C. TWO'S 
WORKING LUNCH HAS BEEN 
INVESTIGATING IT BOILER ROOM FRAUD 
HOW COMMON IS IT 
IT IS BECOMING 
VERY COMMON IT LOOKS AS THOUGH 
POSSIBLY MORE THAN ONE BILLION A 
YEAR COULD BE BEING CREAMED OFF 
FROM BRITISH INVESTORS THE REASON 
WE KNOW HOW COMMON IT IS IS WE SEE 
THE LETTERS COMING IN DISTRESSED 
CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST 
TENS OF THOUSANDS SOMETIMES 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS POUNDS AS A 
RESULT OF THESE FRAUDSTERS WHO 
OFTEN OPERATE FOR INSTANCE FROM 
SPAIN THAT IS WHERE A LOT OF THESE 
BOILER ROOMS ARE SET UP IT LOOKS 
AS THOUGH THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED OF 
THESE BOILER ROOMS OPERATING THERE 
THE POLICE ARE INUNDATED WITH THESE 
STORIES TALES OF SUICIDES THAT 
SORT OF THING BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
BEEN AFFECTED IT IS VERY SERIOUS 
LET'S HEAR FROM ONE OF THOSE CASES 
IT IS A VIEWER OF WORKING LUNCH HE 
HAS LOST FORTY THOUSAND IT IS KEN NET 
FUDGE FROM DORSET 
YOU HAVE TO 
WATCH WHAT YOU ARE DOING A LOT OF 
PEOPLE COULD GET STUCK FOR A LOT 
MORE THAT IS WHAT I AM WORRIED 
ABOUT I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THIS 
IS WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD L. 
DON'T WANT THEM TO GET STUCK 
ESPECIALLY POOR FAMILIES 
HOW DO 
PEOPLE GET INTO THIS KIND OF MESS 
WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE BEHIND IT YOU YOU WOULD THINK IF YOU GOT A CALL AND 
SOMEBODY OFFERING YOU SHARES YOU 
WOULD PUT THE PHONE DOWN THEY ARE 
MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THAT IT IS 
LIKE COMPLERS SHALL SALES 
OPERATIONS THEY HAVE ALL 
COMMERCIAL SALES OPERATIONS THEY 
HAVE LISTS OF NAMES AND EVEN YOUR 
INTERESTS SO THEY CAN GET YOU 
HOOKED ON THE PHONE AND THEY HAVE 
WHAT WE HAVE AN INSIGHT INTO IS THE 
WAY THESE BOILER ROOMS WORK LIKE 
TWENTY SAELTSMEN THEY HAVE A LOT OF 
JARGON THEY HAVE LOADERS THEY ARE 
THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE 
AND TAKE TENS OF THOUSANDS FROM YOU 
THEY HAVE SLOPERS WHO CHARGE YOU 
FEES TO TRY AND GET YOUR SHARES 
BACK LET'S LISTEN TO A DEALER WE 
SPOKE TO WHO WANTED TO REMAIN 
ANONYMOUS WHO GAVE US AN INSIGHT 
INTO HOW THEY WORK 
NEW INVESTORS 
ARE SIMPLE IF THEY SAY THEY HAVE 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN INHERITANCE YOU START 
THE BASICS YOU TEACH THEM IN 
EFFECT THEY ARE SO HAPPY AND 
GRATEFUL THEN INSTEAD OF TAKING 
THE ONE HUNDRED YOU SAY LET'S TAKE 
FIVE THOUSAND MAYBE TEN THOUSAND TO TWENTY THOUSAND TO 
START OFF FEFPB THEY ARE HAPPY 
THE TRICK IS NOT TO DO IT START 
SMALL AND TAKE IT FROM THERE WHAT 
THEY DON'T KNOW IS THAT TWO WEEKS 
LATER ONCE WE HAVE GOT THE FIVE THOUSAND 
WE WILL SEND THEM TO A LODER WHO 
WILL RIP THEM TO PIECES 
TO A 
LOADER WHO WILL RIP THEM TO PIECES 
WHY ARE THEY BOILER ROOMS IT IT STARTED IN THE STATES A DECADE AGO 
THERE ARE A LOT OF WEBSITES TRYING 
TO RECRUIT YOU YOU PUT YOUR NAME 
DOWN THEN THEY PHONE YOU BACK 
THEY GET A MUCH BIGGER YIELD FROM 
THAT WAY RATHER THAN COLD CALLING 
YOU THERE IS A NEW TACTIC 
PRETENDING TO BE AN AUTHORISED 
LICENSED COMPANY YOU NEED TO CHECK 
UP ON WHO YOU ARE DEALING THEY ARE 
TRYING TO SELL CLONED SHARES 
RATHER THAN SOMETHING DODGEY THEY 
WILL OFFER YOU A SHARE IN GOOGLE 
MICROSOFT ACCEPT IT IS NOT THE 
GOOGLE IT IS SOMETHING THEY HAVE 
SET UP IN PAN THAT OR ELSEWHERE 
YOUR MONEY GOES TO THEIR ACCOUNT 
NEVER COMMIT YOURSELF ON THE PHONE 
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE DRAWN INTO 
THIS CHECK UP BEFORE HAND DEAL 
WITH SOMEONE YOU KNOW WHO IT IS 
BUY SOMETHING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND 
THANK YOU FOR THAT 
WORKING LUNCH OF COURSE ON AT THE 
USUAL TIME ON B. B. C. TWO AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY YOU 
CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BOILER 
ROOM SCAMS THERE SO IT IS CHELSEA 
VERSES MAN U. IN THE FIRST ALL 
ENGLISH FINAL 
WITH TALK OF TICKET PRICES WHAT 
SORT OF WELCOME AWAITS FANS IN 
MOSCOW WE CAN GET AN ANSWER TO 
THAT FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT WHO IS 
THERE IT WILL ALL BE A RUSH FANS 
HAVE TO GET TICKETS AND THEY VA TO 
GET VISAS WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS 
YESTERDAY ON THE PROGRAMME ARE THE 
RUSSIANS MAKING ANY EXTRA MEASURES 
TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO GET 
IN 
THEY SAY THEY WILL MAKE AN IN ANNOUNCEMENT ON HOW THEY WILL 
SIMPLIFY THE VISA REGULATIONS 
USUALLY IT COMPLICATED TO GET A 
VISA YOU NEED A HOTEL BOOKING 
DOCUMENTS TO BACK THAT UP THEY SAY 
THEY WILL MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT 
WHICH SHOULD MEAN THAT IF YOU HAVE 
GOT A TICKET A LEGITIMATE TICKET 
TO THE CUP FINAL YOU WILL BE ABLE 
TO USE THAT TO GO TO THE EMBASSY 
AND GET YOUR VISA AND YOU WILL NOT 
NEED ANYTHING ELSE BUT I STILL DO 
WONDER HOW THEY ARE GOING TO MANAGE 
IT LOGISTICALLY IT IS FORTY TWO THOUSAND VISAS 
THEY WILL HAVE TO ISSUE IN THE NEXT 
FEW WEEKS THAT IS OUT OF ONE 
EMBASSY IN ONE COUNTRY IT WILL BE 
A LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE FOR THE 
RUSSIANS 
IT SEEMS THERE ARE MORE RUSSIANS SEATS IN THE STADIUM THAN THERE ARE 
HOTEL ROOMS 
APPARENTLY THERE ARE 
WITH POTEN POTENTIALLY FORTY THOUSAND OR 
MORE FANS FROM THE U. K. COMING TO 
THIS MATCH IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO 
HOW WHREFRB FIND A HOTEL ROOM NOT 
JUST THAT BY ONE WHICH IS 
AFFORDABLE THIS CITY IS RATED AS 
THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE WORLD FOR 
FOREIGN VISITORS HOTEL ROOMS START 
AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY A NIGHT AND GO UP TO FIVE HUNDRED 
EVEN IF YOU CAN FIND A ROOM IT 
COULD BE A VERY EXPENSIVE ROOM IF IF YOUR TEAM LOSES IT IS A LONG WAY 
HOME 
THIS IS BREAKFAST THESE ARE OUR 
MAIN STORIES THE PARENTS OF 
MADELEINE MCCANN HAVE MADE A NEW 
APPEAL FOR INFORMATION DAYS BEFORE 
THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF HER

PRODUCING SOME SHOWERS AND RAIN 
THE FORECAST REALLY FOR TODAY IS 
MORE HEAVY SHOWERS SOME WITH 
THUNDER AND SOME ALSO WITH HAIL 
EMBEDDED IN THEM ON THE RADAR YOU 
CAN SEE THE SHOWERS THAT WE'VE HAD 
AND RAIN ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND 
SCOTLAND THE RAIN ACROSS SCOTLAND 
WILL CONTINUE AS WE GO THROUGH THE 
MORNING THE PICTURE WE'RE NOW 
LOOKING AT IS NINE A M. A LOT OF CLOUD 
AS WELL IN THE EAST AND SOUTH LOW 
CLOUD AND MURKY CONDITIONS IT'S 
THE SAME THIS MORNING FOR THE NORTH 
EAST OF ENGLAND LOW CLOUD AND 
MURKY CONDITIONS WITH SOME SHOWERS 
IT SHOULD IMPROVE THRUF THE DAY AS 
WE HEAD FURTHER SOUTH HERE TOO 
WE'RE NOT IMMUNE TO SOME SHOWERS 
IN BETWEEN IT WILL BE BRIGHT OR 
SUNNY SPELLS THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND SOME SHOWERS HERE AS WELL 
BUT NOT AS COLD AS IT HAS BEEN FOR 
WALES SOME SHOWERS BUT ALSO SOME 
GOOD BREAKS SUNSHINE COMING 
THROUGH AND THE RAIN EVENTUALLY 
DYING AWAY FROM NORTHERN IRELAND 
WE'LL SEE ONE OR TWO SHOWERS 
THROUGH THE DAY HERE TOO WITH SOME 
SUNSHINE BUT THE BEST OF THE 
SUNSHINE TODAY THROUGH THE DAY IS 
LIKELY TO BE IN THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND AND ALSO THE NORTH OF WALES 
AND PARTS OF THE SOUTH COAST THRUF 
THE DAY WE SEE FURTHER SHOWERS 
DEVELOP SOME OF THEM WILL BE HEAVY 
FROM THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND TO 
THE MIDLANDS AND EAST ANGLIA ALSO 
HEAVY ONE AS CROSS SCOTLAND 
THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON 
AND INTO THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT 
MANY OF THE SHOWERS DIE AWAY 
THERE'S A GOOD CLEARANCE IN THE SKY 
IT'S A CHILLY NIGHT ALSO SOME 
PATCHY MIST AND PATCHY FOG AROUND 
IT SHOULDN'T PRESENT TOO MUCH OF A 
PROBLEM IN THE MORNING WHEN THAT 
DISAPPEARS THERE WILL BE QUITE A 
BIT OF SUNSHINE FIRST THING BUT 
THEN THE SHOWERS GET GOING AGAIN 
TOMORROW THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE 
HEAVIEST ACROSS SCOTLAND AND SOME 
OF THEM WILL HAVE HAIL AND THUNDER 
AND LIGHTNING THROWN IN 
TEMPERATURES UP A TOUCH TODAY 
THAT'S HOW IT'S LOOKING 
TEMPERATURES UP A TOUCH TODAY THAT'S HOW IT'S LOOKING 
LOTS OF 
OLD FASHIONED GADGETS ON SET TODAY 
ELECTRIC TROUSER PRESS 
DO YOU 
REMEMBER THAT 
IT'S BEFORE EVEN MY 
TIME 
I WASN'T ASKING YOU SOMEBODY TIME WILL REMEMBER YOU COULD PACK IN 
YOUR CASE WHEN YOU GO AWAY VERY 
USEFUL ELECTRIC CARVING KNIFE 
WHICH MANY OF YOU STILL USE 
INCLUDING DAPHNE RUDD SHE HALLS 
ARTHRITIS SO IT REALLY HELPS 
I BET 
AARON HAS KNIFE EDGED CREASES 
I TRY TO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
TOUGH TIMES OR TRYING TO SURVIVE 
THESE EXTRA TOUGH TIMES THERE'S NO 
SURPRISE THAT WITH THE RISING 
PRICES THAT U. K. HOUSEHOLDS ARE 
STARTING TO FEEL THE PINCH IN FACT 
THE TUC IS NOW SAYING IT IS VERY 
CONCERNED THAT WITH THESE EXTRA 
FINANCIAL PRESSURES THAT IT IS 
FORCING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE OUT 
THERE TO GO AND HAVE TO FIND A 
SECOND OR THIRD JOB OF COURSE THE 
ADDITIONAL STRESS OF TAKING ALL 
THESE EXTRA HOURS ON PUTS FAMILIES 
UNDER PRESSURE IN PARTICULAR IT'S 
WOMEN WHO ARE OPTING TO TAKE ON THE 
EXTRA WORK 
HI HANNAH 
HANNAH WORKS THIRTY HOURS A 
WEEK FOR THE N. H. S. IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE 
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS SHE'S HAD A 
SECOND JOB AS WELL WHICH CAN 
REQUIRE AS MANY HOURS AGAIN YOU YOU CAN HAVE A TRY 
SHE STARTED WORK AS 
AN AVON REPRESENT TOIF RAISE MONEY 
FOR A HOUSE AND FUND HER WEDDING 
WITH RISING BILLS THE EXTRA INCOME 
HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL 
WE'RE IN THAT 
BRACKET WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
YOU GO OUT TO WORK BUT PRAPS THE 
JOB THAT YOU'RE IN DOESN'T HAVE 
ENOUGH MONEY FOR EVERYTHING GOING 
OUT YOU KNOW BY DOING SOMETHING 
LIKE AVON IT GIVES YOU MORE 
FINANCIAL FREEDOM 
IN FACT THE 
BURDEN OF FINDING EXTRA WORK HAS 
FALLEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON WOMEN 
OVER THE LAST YEAR THE NUMBER OF 
MEN GETTING SECOND JOBS HAS GONE UP 
BY JUST OH TWO PER CENT BUT THE NUMBER OF 
WOMEN DOING SO HAS RISEN BY NINE PER CENT 
CREDIT IS MORE EXPENSIVE HOUSING 
COSTS ARE GOING UP ENERGY BILLS 
ARE RISING OBVIOUSLY THAT IS A KEY 
FACTOR PRESSURISING PEOPLE TO TAKE 
ON SECOND JOBS 
ONE RECENT REPORT 
SAYS FIFTEEN PER CENT OF MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES 
ARE TAKING ON SECOND JOBS A TREND 
CHT TUC SAYS CAN LEAD TO EXTRA 
FAMILY STRESS AND EVEN BREAK DOWN 
AT SEVEN FIFTY A M. I TALK TO AN EXPERT ABOUT 
THIS TOPIC IF YOU'VE BEEN FORCED

DROP US AN E. MAIL IF 
YOU ARE FORCED TO TAKE ON EXTRA 
JOBS WHEN YOU THINK OF THE TYPE OF 
PEOPLE AT RISK OF DEVELOPING HEART 
DISEASE YOU DON'T THINK OF WOMEN 
IN THEIR THIRTIES OR FORTIES A NEW REPORT 
IS WARNING THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG 
WOMEN DYING FROM HEART PROBLEMS 
COULD BE INCREASING MORE PEOPLE IN 
THE U. K. DIE OF CORONARY HEART 
DISEASE THAN ANYTHING ELSE NEARLY 
ONE IN FOUR WOMEN IN BRITAIN WILL 
DIE FROM HEART DISEASE IF WOMAN 
HAS DIABETES SHE'S UP TO TEN TIMES 
MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP HEART 
PROBLEMS PETE SCARBOROUGH IS FROM 
THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD THIS IS 
SURPRISING ISN'T IT YEAH YEAH CERTAINLY SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES HEART 
DISEASE RATES IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE 
BEEN GOING DOWN THAT'S GENERALLY 
BEEN THE PATTERN THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN USED TO THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN 
TREATMENT AND GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS 
IN RISK FACTOR PROFILE MEANS HEART 
DISEASE RATES ARE COMING DOWN 
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOUNGER AGE 
GROUPS PARTICULARLY YOUNGER WOMEN 
THIS TREND SEEMS TO BE FINISHING 
THE TRENDS IN YOUNGER WOMEN SEEMS 
TO BE PLATEAUING AND THERE'S 
CONCERN THEY'RE BEGIN TO INCREASE 
WHAT ARE THE MAIN CAUSES 
THE PAPER 
THAT WE PRODUCED WOULDN'T ACTUALLY 
DIDN'T ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE REASONS 
FOR THE CHANGE SPECULATION WE 
WOULD CONSIDER THAT IT WOULD BE DUE 
TO THE RISK FACTOR PROVIDE OF THIS 
AGE OF WOMEN SMOKING RATES OVER 
THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS IN THIS AGE GROUP 
HAVE STAYED STABLE ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT MINUS TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS WE'VE HAD 
THE OBESITY EPIDEMIC WITH THAT 
DIABETES LEVELS HAVE SHOT UP 
THAT'S CAUSING THIS UNSAVOURY TREND 
IN HEART DISEASE RATES 
WHEN WOMEN 
HAVE HEART TROUBLE HEART ATTACKS 
IS IT THE CASE THAT THEY DON'T TEND 
TO RESPOND AS WELL AS MEN IN THAT 
THEIR RISK OF DYING THE SECOND TIME 
ROUND IS GREATER IS THAT RIGHT 
CERTAINLY AT THIS AGE GROUP IT'S 
NOT CLEAR IF THAT WOULD BE THE CASE 
IN THE OLDER AGE GROUPS THE 
SECONDARY RISKS THERE'S 
DIFFERENT RISK PROFILE BETWEEN MEN 
AND WOMEN WOMEN TEND TO GET IT AT 
AN OLDER AGE THAN MEN AN OLDER AGE 
WILL TEND TO HAVE WORSE PROGNOSIS 
ANY WAY THAT IS THE CASE 
IN OTHER 
WORDS AS WE'RE ALWAYS BEING TOLD 
IT'S A CHANGE IN THE WAY YOU LIVE 
YOUR LIFE 
SKHRACTLY EXACTLY AT 
THE MOMENT THESE ARE THIS REPORT 
IS AN EARLY WARNING OF SIGNS TO 
COME IT NEEDS TO BE BACKED UP WITH 
MORE LATER IN THE LIFE THERE'S NO 
ROOM TO BE COMPLACENT OVER HEART 
DISEASE RATES IF THEY START TO 
TURN IF THE TREND TURNS TO YOUNGER 
AGE GROUPS IT COULD SPREAD TO OLDER 
AGE GROUPS IF THAT HAPPENS WE 
COULD HAVE A BIG PROBLEM PETE PETE SCARBOROUGH THANK YOU

THAT SEALED THE WIN 
IT IS CHELSEA WHO ARE OFF TO MOSCOW

THAN TO TODAY IT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
FOR THIS CLUB AND WE ARE STILL 
FIGHTING FOR THE CHAMPIONS 
EVERYTHING WILL BE O. K. 
WHEN WE 
SCORED THE GOAL I WAS REALLY 
PLEASED A LOT OF CONFIDENT 
THINKING THINKING WE COULD

ABOUT THE FUTURE

THEY HOPE TO GET THROUGH TO THE 
UEFA CUP FINAL THEY WILL BE OFF TO 
THE CITY TO PLAY WALTER'S SIDE 
HAVE TRAVELLED TO FLORENCE KNOWING

THERE IS NOT A 
LOT OF TIMES IN YOUR CAREER YOU CAN 
LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING A EUROPEAN

OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE THEY HAVE 
PASSED US BY SO HOPEFULLY THIS ONE 
WILL NOT PASS US BY BOTH THE TEAMS 
THAT ARE HERE HAVE PLAYED A LOT OF 
GAMES TO GET TO THIS STAGE EACH 
WILL THINK THEY DESERVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO THE FINAL 
LET'S GET AWAY FROM FOOTBALL NOW 
MOMENTARILY ALL SNOOKER FANS HAVE 
GOT THE FINAL THEY WANTED STEPHEN 
HENDRY AGAINST RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
STEPHEN HENDRY SNEAKED THROUGH 
YESTERDAY HE HENDRY HIS WON LAST 
TITLE BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE HE DID NOT TAKE 
LONG TO WRAP UP THE MATCH THIRTEEN TO SEVEN AS 
FOR THE ROCKET HE TOO COMPLETED A 
THIRTEEN TO SEVEN WIN LIANG WENBO HAD KEPT IT 
CLOSE IN THE EARLY STAGES BUT 
O'SULLIVAN'S GREATER EXPERIENCE 
TOLD IN THE END 
AND LITTLE BIT OF RUGBY NEWS FOR 
YOU GARRAETH JENKINS IS BEING 
TIPPED FOR RETURN AFTER SCARLETS 
CONFIRMED THE DEPARTURE OF PHIL 
DAVIS THE SCARLETS HAVE STRUGGLED 
IN EUROPE AND IN THE CELTIC LEAGUE 
DAVIS WHO JOINED TWO YEARS AGO 
WHEN JENKINS TOOK OVER AS THE WELSH 
NATIONAL COACH LOOKS LIKE HE HAS 
PAID THE PRICE 
THAT IS ALL THE SPORT FROM ME FOR 
NOW HERE AT STAMFORD BRIDGE THEY 
ARE GETTING READY FOR MOSCOW AS 
YOU KNOW AS I KNOW WE NEED PLENTY 
OF TIME TO GET VISA TICKET AND A 
HOTEL ROOM AND THEY ARE VERY VERY 
SCARCE TOPPING AND TAILING THAT 
IS A HORRIBLE THOUGHT IN A HOTEL 
ROOM IN MOSCOW 
LAST NIGHT'S FOOTBALL MIGHT BE 
EXCITING ENOUGH JUST THE THOUGHT 
OF HOTEL ACCOMMODATION IS ENOUGH 
FOR SIAN ONLY SPORTS WITH DANGER 
CAN GIVE SOME A PROPER BUZZ WITH 
US WE HAVE THE EXTREME SPORTS 
ENTHUSIAST JAMIE TOMKINS ALEX 
BARNES FROM THE EXTREME SPORTS 
CHANNEL AND LINDA PAPADOPOULOUS 
WHY DO YOU DO IT 
IT IS LIKE THE 
ADRENALINE CONTROL OF ADRENALINE 
IT IS ADDICTIVE L. CANNOT STOP 
WHAT IS YOUR EXTREME SORT OF 
CHOICE 
MOUNTAIN BIKE DOWN HILL CHOICE RACING L. WAS ON THE TEAM FOR TEN 
YEARS SO ALSO I AM REALLY INTO 
SURFING AND SNOWBOARDING 
HAVE YOU 
EVER INJURED YOURSELF 
I HAVE 
BROKEN A COUPLE OF COLLAR BONES 
BUT NOTHING THAT SERIOUS 
THIS HAS 
COME ABOUT BECAUSE OF AN ACCIDENT 
EARLIER THIS WEEK IN NEW ZEALAND 
INVOLVING A BRITISH WOMAN WHO WAS 
WATER BOARD ING WHAT HAPPENED 
TRAVELLING DOWN RIVER ON A BODY BOARD 
TELL US WHAT A BODY BOARD IS BOARD IT IS A SMALL SURF BOARD 
EFFECTIVELY THAT ORIGINALLY WAS 
USED FOR SURFING LYING DOWN IN THE 
OCEAN 
THAT IS ONE THAT IS AN OCEAN INCREASINGLY POPULAR ACTIVITY ALL ALL THE SPORTS THAT ARE EXTREME ARE 
GROWING IN POPULARITY AND BECOMING 
MORE MAINSTREAM NOW BECAUSE OF 
THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING IT UP MUCH 
MORE FREQUENTLY THEY THIS IS 
OBVIOUSLY A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY WE 
WOULD ALWAYS SUGGEST THAT WHEN YOU 
START YOUR SPORTS YOU DO IT UNDER 
CONTROLLED CIRCUMSTANCES WITH 
EXPERTS DO YOUR RESEARCH MAKE 
SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT SAFETY GEAR 
MAKE SURE IT IS WORKING NEVER PUSH 
YOURSELF TOO FAR 
YOU MIGHT HAVE 
THOUGHT WE WERE HEARING THAT THESE 
EXTREME SPORTS ARE ON THE INCREASE 
WHY WE LIVE IN AN ADRENALINE 
FUELLED SOCIETY WHY ARE PEOPLE 
SEEKING EXTRA RISKS 
THE ADRENALINE 
PART HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SPORT 
WE MIGHT BE STRESSED AT WORK ONE 
MIGHT ARGUE PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE IT 
IS THE EMOTIONAL RELEASE IT GIVES 
YOU AS WELL IT IS INTERESTING THE 
RECONNECTION WITH NATURE AND HOW 
PEOPLE NEED THAT AS WELL SO THE 
IDEA THAT YOU ARE DOING THIS BUT 
YOU ARE DOING IT IN AN ENVIRONMENT 
WHICH IS NOT YOUR USUAL NINE TO FIVE 
ENCLOSED WAY WHETHER IT IS BEING 
IN THE OCEAN OR ON A MOUNTAIN 
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT RECONNECTION 
FINALLY AND IMPORTANTLY IT IS A 
TYPE OF PERSONALITY AND I WATCH 
THE EXTREME SPORTS CHANNEL I THINK 
IT IS GREAT YOU SEE THREE OR FOUR 
CORE THINGS ABOUT THE PERSONALITYS 
OF OF THE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS 
OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE VERY MUCH INTO 
RISK OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE NOT THE 
KIND OF COME FOR MYSELFS THAT YOU 
WOULD SEE THERE IS A COME 
FORISTS MORE COMPETITION THAN YOU 
WOULD SEE IN OTHER SPORTS THE THE SPORTING IDEAL USED TO BE FASTER 
HIGHER LONGER IN A SENSE YOU ARE 
STRETCHING THAT 
IT IS ABOUT 
PUSHING THE LIMITS TAKING WHAT WAS 
THERE BEFORE AND WHETHER IT IS 
BIGGER JUMPS BIGGER SURF 
TELL US 
ABOUT YOUR SURFING MOST PEOPLE 
SURF ON BEACHES YOU DON'T 
WE LIKE 
TO SURF OVER REEFS THAT IS A ROCK 
BOTTOM WHY 
IT PRODUCE A BETTER BOTTOM WHY QUALITY OF WAVE IT IS MORE 
CONSISTENT IT IS SHALLOW IT IS 
QUITE DANGEROUS IT IS ALL ABOUT 
THE EXTREME 
ONCE YOU HAVE GOT USED 
TO IT WITH ANYTHING YOU ARE 
LOOKING FOR THE NEXT THING AND THE 
NEXT THING WHERE DO YOU THINK 
THIS IS GOING TO TAKE YOU ARE YOU 
LOOKING FOR BIGGER HIGHS AND MANAGE 
TO CONQUUR WHATEVER IT IS DOWNHILL 
MOTORBIKE RACING OR REEFS IS 
THERE SOMETHING YOU HAVE NOT DONE 
YET THAT YOU THINK YOU WOULD LOVE 
TO HOWEVER RISKY 
PROBABLY THE 
BIGGEST WAVE OR MOST BIGGEST 
MOUNTAIN TO MOTORBIKE DOWN 
WHAT IS 
THE MOST POPULAR ACTIVITY THAT 
PEOPLE WATCH ON YOUR CHANNEL IN IN TERMS OF WATCHING THE CHANNEL AND 
TAKING PART IT IS PROBABLY 
MOUNTAIN BIKING SKATING BMXS THE 
THREE MOST POPULAR SPORTS 
SEDATE COMPARED TO THINGS THIS YOUNG MAN 
DOES 
THE THING ABOUT THESE SPORTS DOES IS YOU CAN DO THEM WHATEVER LEVEL 
YOU LIKE TO WHETHER YOU WANT TO 
TAKE YOUR MOUNTAIN BIKE OUT AND 
RIDE AROUND THE PARK OR JUMP OFF 
FORTY FOOT CLIFFS IN THE ALPS YOU CAN 
DO IT AT DIFFERENT LEVELS THE 
GREAT THING IS ANYBODY CAN TAKE 
PART 
LINDA ANY OF THIS APPEALED PART TO YOU 
I AM GETTING PANIC ATTACKS 
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT WHAT DOES 
APPEAL IS PEOPLE STRETCH THEMSELVES 
SO LONG AS IT IS DONE AT A SAFE 
ENVIRONMENT IT IS HEALTHY FOR YOUR 
BODY AND YOUR MIND THIS IDEA THAT 
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING MORE ISN'T ISN'T THE POINT THAT IT IS NOT SAFE 
ISN'T THAT PART OF IT 
IT IS PART 
OF IT IT IS OVERCOMING FEARS IF 
YOU TAKE A BIG RISK AND BUILD UP TO 
IT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE DONE THE 
PRACTICE YOU HAVE GOT THE SKILLS 
THAT WAY IT MINIMISES THE RISK 
THERE IS STILL A FEAR ELEMENT THERE 
WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO STAY SAFE IF 
YOU CAN 
I WILL TRY AND 
I WILL TRY TO I CANNOT EVEN GO 
ON A ROLLER COASTER 
I CHIPPED A TOOTH ROLLERSKATING L. 
HAD TO HAVE IT TAKEN OUT DO YOU

WEALS TOO WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE 
SHOWERS GOOD BREAKS AND SUNSHINE 
SOME SUNSHINE DEVELOPING ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND WHERE CURRENTLY IT

RAIN THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE 
TODAY IS LIKELY TO BE ACROSS THE

THANKS FOR THAT BILL WE'VE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT SECOND JOBS AND I 
HAVE TO SAY IT IS ALREADY A 
POPULAR TREND IN THE UNITED STATES 
AS WE'RE SEEING COSTS HERE SOAR 
WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE 
HERE IN THE U. K. HAVING TO GO OUT AND 
FIND AN EXTRA JOB TO RAISE THE 
EXTRA VERY VALUABLE CASH BUT GOT 
TO SAY IT IS A TREND NOT WELCOMED 
BY EVERYBODY UNIONS ARE WARNING OF 
THE STRESS THAT A SECOND JOB PUTS 
ON FAMILIES OF COURSE IT LEADS US 
TO THE QUESTION JUST WHY IS THIS 
HAPPENING WELL WE'VE GOT A SURVEY 
BY THE PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITE 
USWITCH THEY SAY THE AVERAGE 
WORKER WILL TAKE HOME FORTY FOUR EXTRA IN 
THEIR PAY PACKET BUT HERE IS THE 
CLINGER BECAUSE THE EXTRA COST OF 
HEATING FOOD AND FUEL IS RISING 
VERY FAST ALMOST TRIPLE THAT SUM 
THAT IS UP AROUND ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT EXTRA A 
MONTH UNSURPRISINGLY THEN THE 
GOVERNMENT'S OWN FIGURES SHOW OVER 
A MILLION PEOPLE HERE IN THE U. K. NOW 
HAVE AN EXTRA JOB WHILE ONLY OH TWO PER CENT 
OF THOSE PEOPLE TAKING ON AN EXTRA 
JOB ARE MEN THE FIGURES FOR WOMEN 
INCREASED BY NINE P. I. R. S. THANKS FOR YOUR 
E. MAILS A LOT OF THEM HIGHLIGHTING 
THE SAME PROBLEMS ONE CHERYL IN 
READING SAYS THANK YOU CHERYL 
I'M ON MATERNITY LEAVE AT THE 
MOMENT MY HUSBAND HAS GOT FOUR 
JOBS JUST TO PAY THE BILLS TOUGH 
TIMES A LOT OF E. MAILS TO DO WITH 
TAX QUESTIONS WE'RE ASKING THOSE 
NOW CHRISTINE ROSS THE FINANCIAL 
ADVISOR FROM S. G. HAMBROS JOINS US 
ONE OF OUR REGULAR MONEY EXPERTS ON 
P. BREAKFAST WELCOME HOW MUCH 
MONEY CAN ONE BOOST A HOUSEHOLD 
INCOME BY TAKING ON A SECOND JOB 
IT DEPENDS ON YOUR SKILLS AND WHAT 
WORK'S AVAILABLE A COMMON EXAMPLE 
WOULD BE A QUALIFIED NURSE WHO 
COULD WORK NIGHTS WHEN THE PARTNER 
IS AT HOME TO LOOK AFTER THE 
CHILDREN BUT THOSE WORK ANYTHING 
BARS AN RESTAURANTS WOULDN'T EARN 
QUITE AS MUCH 
WE SEE THESE FIGURES 
WITH WOMEN QUITE A HEALTHY RISE IN 
THAT SENSE IS IT ONLY WOMEN FROM 
SAY HOUSEHOLD FAMILIES OR ARE WE 
SEEING A RISE IN SINGLE WOMEN 
TAKING A SECOND JOB 
THE RESEARCH 
SUGGESTS THAT IT'S BOTH L. IMAGINE 
THIS A LOT OF WOMEN WITH FAMILIES 
ARE WORKING PARTTIME IN THE DAY IF 
THEY WORKED FULLTIME THE CARE COSTS 
FOR CHILDREN WOULD OUTWEIGH THE 
BENEFITS AND THEY'RE TAKING ON 
EXTRA JOBS SINGLE WOMEN PERHAPS 
THEY'RE ON THE HOUSING LADDER 
MORTGAGES HAVE GONE UP THEY'RE 
HAVING TO TAKE A JOB ON TO MAKE 
ENDS MEET 
THE KEY QUESTION A LOT 
OF E. MAILDS ABOUT THIS WILL AN 
EXTRA JOB OR TWO IMPACT FAMILY 
BENEFIT AND TAXES 
IT CERTAINLY 
COULD AFFECT ANY BENEFITS THAT 
YOU'RE RECEIVING IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
TO CHECK WITH THE CITIZENS' ADVICE 
BUREAU ASKING IF I EARN THIS MUCH 
MORE WILL I BE BETTER OFF AND ARE 
THERE ANY OTHER BENEFITS I SHOULD 
BE CLAIMING 
BRIEFLY THERE ARE 
OTHER WAYS YOU MENTIONED USEFUL 
TIPS ABOUT NOT HAVING TO TAKE ON AN 
EXTRA JOB OTHER WAYS OF MAKING 
MONEY 
IF YOU HAVE SPACE IN YOUR MONEY HOUSE AND YOU OWN IT THERE'S A 
RENT A ROOM SCHEME EARNING FOUR THOUSAND 
A YEAR TAX FREE IT'S ANOTHER WAY 
OF DOING IT 
RENTING A ROOM I'VE 
GOT TWO THEY'RE UP FOR RENT RIGHT

COLD WHATEVER YOU WANT HOT COLD 
THANK YOU VERY M. C. H. 
RENTING HIS ROOMS OUT IF YOU FANCY 
A GAPBLBLE THIS COULD BE GOLD 
PLATED YOU CAN BUY A SHARE IN TEN 
WORTH OF BULLION IT WILL ONLY COST 
YOU FIFTY 
THERE'S ALWAYS A CATCH 
THE CATCH IS THE GOLD IS AT THE 
BOTTOM OF THE SEA CHRIS BUCKLER IS 
IN BELFAST MORNING CHRIS GOOD GOOD MORNING BELFAST OF COURSE A CITY 
WITH A PROUD MARITIME HERITAGE 
BEHIND ME H. M. S. CAROLINE A WARSHIP 
S. S. LAURENTIC STARTED AS A PASSENGER 
LINER JUST LIKE THE TITANIC WHICH 
WAS ALSO BUILT HERE IN THE CASE OF 
THE LAURENTIC IT ENDED UP A WARSHIP 
AND THE OTHER THING IT SHARES WITH 
THE TITANIC IT ALSO MET SOMETHING 
OF A DISASTROUS END IT WAS 
CARRYING GOLD BULLION AS PART OF 
THE WAR EFFORT TO CANADA WHEN IT 
WAS SUNK IT WAS CARRYING FIVE 
MILLION WORTH OF GOLD BULLION IN 
NINETEEN SEVENTEEN MONEY TODAY THAT WOULD BE 
WORTH SOMETHING OVER ONE BILLION 
THE LAURENTIC LIES FORTY METRES BELOW 
THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND SHE 
STILL HOLDS THE PROSPECT OF GOLD 
WHEN THE SHIP SANK IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN SHE WAS 
CARRYING MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND GOLD BARS 
TWENTY OF 
NEVER BEEN 
TWENTY OF THEM HAVE NEVER BEEN RECOVERED ON BOARD ANOTHER SHIP 
H. M. S. CAROLINE THE LAURENTIC WAS 
LAUNCHED AGAIN WITH PEOPLE GIVEN A 
CHANCE TO BUY SHARES IN THE WRECK 
THOUGH THERE'S LITTLE HOPE OF EVER 
FINDING THAT REMAINING TEN MILLION 
FORTUNE IN GOLD BULLION 
IT'S NOT 
AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY ALTHOUGH 
LOOKING AT THE PRICES OF HOUSES 
THESE DAYS IT MIGHTN'T BE A BAD ONE 
IT'S A BIT OF FUN IT'S A BIT OF 
HISTORY IT'S A LOAD OF THINGS ALL 
MIXED UP IT'S A CHANCE TO BUY INTO 
A DREAM TO ACTUALLY OWN A PART OF 
A WHITE STAR LINE 
IT WAS BUILT TO 
BE A PASSENGER LINER SHE WAS 
DRAFTED IN TO PLAY A PART IN THE 
FIRST WORLD WAR EFFORT THE GOLD 
BULLION WAS BEING TAKE TON CANADA 
TO PAY FOR MUNITIONS WHEN SHE HIT 
MINES THERE WAS A DREADFUL LOSS OF 
LIFE AND THE GOLD WENT DOWN WITH 
THE SHIP IN LESS THAN A DECADE 
ROYAL NAVY DIVERS RECOVERED ALMOST 
ALL OF IT THE SALVAGE EFFORT WAS 
USED TO CREATE DECOMPRESSION TABLES 
STILL USED FOR SAFE DIVING THE THE EQUIPMENT ITSELF DIVERS WERE USING 
THE WEIGHT ALONE FOR A DIVER TO BE 
WALKING ALONG THE SEA BED WEARING 
LARGE BOTS AND A HELMET AND THE 
WAY IT'S BEEN USED IS AN INCREDIBLE 
FEAT 
AT LOUGH SWILLY THE SHIP FEAT STILL ATTRACTS DIVERS THOUGH THEY 
HAVEN'T FOUND GOLD THEY HAVE FOUND 
OTHER TREASURES RECENTLY 
RECOVERING A GUN 
THE BOUGH IS 
STILL FULLY IN TACT THE REST OF 
THE LAURENTIC IS SCRAP YARD BUT 
YOU HAVE THAT BUZZ ON THAT FEEL 
IT'S INCREDIBLE TO BE DOWN ON IT 
UNDER WATER THE GOLD IS NOT THE 
ONLY ATTRACTION JUST PART OF THE 
LAURENTIC'S RICH HISTORY STILL 
BEING EXPLORED 
YOU CAN SEE THE HERITAGE IS STILL 
REMEMBERED TODAY THE WHITE STAR 
LINE REMEMBERED ALWAYS HERE IN 
BELFAST IT WASN'T JUST THE 
LAURENTIC IT IS WAS OF COURSE THE 
TITANIC TOO THAT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE 
BEHIND THIS SCHEME WERE TRYING TO 
DO THEY WERE TRYING TO GET THE 
PEOPLE WHO LOVED THE TITANIC TO BUY 
INTO THIS FIFTY THOUSAND SHARES ARE UP FOR 
GRABS UP WON'T MAKE ANY MONEY FROM 
IT BUT YOU WILL GET A SENSE OF BOTH 
THE HISTORY AND OF COURSE THE C. D.'S 
THAT RECALL SOME OF THE WHAT THE 
LAURENTIC WAS INVOLVED IN THESE 
CRANES ARE FAMOUS FOR BUILDING THE 
SHIPS HERE THEY'RE STILL HERE AND 
HOPEFULLY LOTS OF PEOPLE WILL WANT 
TO BUY INTO THAT WHOLE VISION THE 
LAURENTIC WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN 
THANKS VERY MUCH ESPECIALLY NOT BY 
PEOPLE SPENDING FIFTY A SHARE LATER 
IN THE PROGRAMME 
EVERY MOVE YOU 
MADE I KNEW EVERY LAST DETAIL

THE PITCH WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF 
THE RAIN BUT MOST IMPORTANT THING 
WAS TO QUALIFY AND TO WIN THIS GAME 
AND TO MAKE ALL THE FANS REALLY 
HAPPY HAPPY AN INVASION OF CHINESE MITTEN CRABS 
IN THE THAMES COULD BE CONTROLLED 
BY ALLOWING THEM TO BE CAUGHT AND 
SOLD ACCORDING TO RESEARCHERS FROM 
THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM THEY 
ESTIMATE THERE ARE MILLIONS OF THE 
CRABS IN THE RIVER BUT THEY'RE 
DESTROYING NATURAL HABITATS THEY THEY ARE TESTING TO SEE HOW MUCH MERCURY 
CADMIUM ETC ARE ACTUALLY IN THE 
MEAT OF THE CRABS IF THE CRAB WAS 
TO PASS THEN WE COULD PERHAPS TAKE 
THE NEXT STEP AND SEE IF WE COULD 
FISH IF IT FAILS THEN THERE WILL

GREETINGS CARD CHALLENGE LAST NIGHT 
BUT WHICH APPRENTICE FAILED TO WARM 
SIR ALAN'S FROSTY HEART WE WILL 
HAVE THE A PITY ON US OVER BRITISH 
TOURISTS WERE ON BOARD A BUS WHICH 
HAS CRASHED IN EGYPT KILLING SEVEN 
PEOPLE AND INJURING SIXTEEN THE BUS 
OVERTURNED AND CAUGHT FIRE AND THE 
SINAI PENINSULA DOZENS OF TOURISTS 
WERE ON THE BUS IT WAS HEADING 
FROM SHARM EL SHEIKH TO CAIRO THE 
NATIONALITY OF THOSE SEVEN PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED HAS NOT YET 
BEEN REVEALED WE HAVE BEEN JOINED 
BY OUR CORRESPONDENT WHO HAS BEEN 
FOLLOWING THE STORY TELL US WHAT 
HAPPENED 
THIS WAS A BUS CARRYING HAPPENED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TOURISTS IT WAS 
TRAVELLING FROM THE POPULAR RESORT 
OF SHARM EL SHEIKH TOWARDS THE 
CAPITAL OF EGYPT CAIRO WE KNOW 
THAT ABOUT FORTY MILES OR SO SOUTH OF 
THE SUEZ CANAL IT OVERTURNED ON 
QUITE A STEEP CORNER AT THAT POINT 
IT CAUGHT FIRE IT SEEMS THE FIRE 
SPREAD QUICKLY THERE ARE 
CONFLICTING REPORTS AT THE MOMENT 
WE DO KNOW THAT AT LEAST SEVEN 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED AS FAR AS 
THE INJURED GOAL WE KNOW THERE 
WERE FORTY PEOPLE ALSO ON THE BUS ONE 
NEWS AGENCY HAS REPORTED THAT IN 
ADDITION TO THE DEAD AS MANY AS TWENTY SEVEN 
MAY BE INJURED THE MAJORITY OF 
THOSE WITH SEVERE BURNS IT DOES 
LOOK AS THOUGH THIS WAS A VERY 
DANGEROUS SITUATION 
THERE WERE 
TOURISTS FROM SEVERAL NATIONALITIES 
ON THAT BUS WEREN'T THEY THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IN 
ADDITION TO TOURISTS FROM BRITAIN 
THERE WAS SOME FROM CANADA ITALY 
RUSSIA AND UKRAINE ONE NEWS AGENCY 
HAS GONE AS FAR AS RELEASING SOME 
FIGURES OF THE INJURED IT BELIEVES 
THAT FOUR BRITONS ARE AMONG THE 
INJURED THAT IS AN CONFIRMED THE 
SAME NEWS AGENCY AS SAYING THAT THIRTEEN 
OF THEM ARE RUSSIAN 
WHAT IS THE 
FOREIGN OFFICE DOING 
THE FOREIGN 
OFFICE HAS AN HONORARY CONSUL BASED 
IN SHARM EL SHEIKH SHE IS DOING 
THE ROUNDS OF THE HOSPITALS THE 
INJURED HAD BEEN TAKEN TO SHARM EL 
SHEIKH THERE ARE SEVERAL HOSPITALS 
THEY COULD BE IN THIS COULD BE A 
TIME CONSUMING PROCESS BEFORE SHE 
IS ABLE TO FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW 
MANY BRITISH NATIONALS HAVE BEEN 
INJURED OR KILLED 
DE BACALL TO 
WORK OUT WHO IS INVOLVED BECAUSE 
THERE IS A LOT OF TRAFFIC BETWEEN 
SHARM EL SHEIKH AND CARO A LOT OF 
BUSES WILL BE GOING ALONG THAT ROAD 
A TIDE THE FOREIGN OFFICE DON'T 
EVEN KNOW OF IT WAS A BUS OPERATED 
BY A TO COMPANY OR A TRANSIT BUS 
THAT WAS RUNNING BETWEEN THE TWO 
DESTINATIONS WHAT THEY ARE 
STRESSING IS THAT THEY ARE WORKING 
AS HARD AS THEY CAN TO FIND 
ANYTHING OUT THEY KNOW SO VERY 
LITTLE AT THIS STAGE SO THERE IS NO 
HELPLINE AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE WHO 
N. AY BE CONCERNED THE PARENTS OF 
MADELEINE MCCANN HAVE TOLD THE B. B. C. 
THEY HAVEN'T GIVEN UP HOPE OF 
FINDING THEIR 
MCCANN HAVE MADE A NEW 
APPEAL FOR INFORMATION JUST DAYS

POLITICAL BLOCKERS YOU CAN ALSO 
CATCH A BUS AS ONLINE CATCH UP 
WITH US ONLINE THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
HAS WARNED THAT LENDERS ARE NOW 
THREATENING A RECOVERY IN THE 
ECONOMY BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING TOO 
CAUTIOUS WITH THEIR CREDIT THE 
BANK SAYS INSTITUTIONS TO LEND CASH 
FREELY IN THE PAST ARE NOW 
RESTRICTING THEIR FUNDS TO 
BORROWERS IT SAYS THAT IS 
UNDERMINING CONFIDENCE IN THE WIDER 
FINANCIAL SYSTEM ZIMBABWE COULD BE 
PLUNGED INTO MORE POLITICAL TURMOIL 
IT'S EXPECTED OFFICIALS WILL CALL 
FOR ZIMBABWEANS TO GO BACK TO THE 
POLLS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SAY 
ROBERT MUGABE DID LOSE THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BUT NOT BY 
ENOUGH TO REMOVE HIM FROM POWER IF 
RUMOURS FROM WITHIN THE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION ARE TRUE THE CONTEST 
WILL GO TO A RUN OFF BETWEEN MR. 
MUGABE AND THE OPPOSITION LEADER 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI DOCTORS SAY MOST 
OF THE CHILDREN FATHERED BY A MAN 
WHO RAPED HIS DAUGHTER ON DOING 
WELL BUT ONE REMAINS IN A CRITICAL 
CONDITION PROSECUTORS SAY JOSEF 
FRITZL IS REFUSING TO ANSWER ANY 
QUESTIONS NATASCHA KAMPUSCH WHO 
WAS KIDNAPPED AND HELD FOR EIGHT 
YEARS IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES HAS 
TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT SHE BELIEVES THAT 
CHILDREN CAN RECOVER IT IS A 
CHILLING HOLIDAY VIDEO THIS IS 
JOSEF FRITZL ENJOYING HIMSELF IN 
THAILAND THE MAN WHO LOCKED AWAY 
HIS DAUGHTER OF A TWENTY FOUR YEARS 
SEXUALLY ABUSED HER AND FATHERED 
HER CHILDREN WHILE JOSEF FRITZL 
RELAXED ON THE BEACH HERE HIS 
DAUGHTER ELISABETH AND HER CHILDREN 
WERE IMPRISONED IN THE BASEMENT OF 
THE FAMILY HOME IN AUSTRIA HE IS 
REFUSING TO ANSWER ANY MORE POLICE 
QUESTIONS BUT JOSEF FRITZL HAS 
ALREADY CONFESSED TO THE CRIME IN 
THE CELLAR POLICE ARE STILL 
SEARCHING HIS HOME ABOVE GROUND AND 
DEEP IN THE BASEMENT WHICH HE HAD 
TURNED INTO A SECRET DUNGEON THEY 
NOW WIND OF IT WIDENING THE 
INVESTIGATION TO SEE WHETHER JOSEF 
FRITZL WAS LINKED TO UNSOLVED 
CRIMES DATING BACK DECADES AS FOR 
ELISABETH SHE IS RECOVERING IN A 
PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC IN AMSTETTEN 
ALONG WITH FIVE OF HER CHILDREN 
THE CASE HAS REVIVED MEMORIES OF 
NATASCHA KAMPUSCH ANOTHER AUSTRIAN 
WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN LOCKED IN A 
CELLAR FOR MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS 
BEFORE SHE MANAGED TO ESCAPE 
I WISH THE FAMILY THE 
BEST OF LUCK AND HOPE THAT THEY 
WILL PULL THROUGH THINK THAT AT 
LEAST THE YOUNGEST ONES WILL 
SUCCEED 
AUSTRIA SAYS IT WANTS TO SUCCEED IMPROVE ITS IMAGE NOW IT REFUSES 
TO BE HELD HOSTAGE BY ONE MAN BUT 
JOSEF FRITZL'S CRIME IS SO SHOCKING 
IT CONTINUES TO CAST A SHADOW OVER 
THIS COUNTRY THE NUMBER OF YOUNGER 
WOMEN DYING FROM HEART DISEASE TO 
BE ON THE INCREASE FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN DECADES RESEARCH HAS A 
WARNING THAT AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLES 
COULD BE TO BLAME THEY SAY OBESITY

BIRMINGHAM HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR 
TUBERCULOSIS A FURTHER SIXTEEN PUPILS

SCHOOL ARE TO UNDERGO FURTHER 
TESTING AFTER INITIAL RESULTS

AROUND CHELSEA FANS CELEBRATING

FAMOUS VICTORY AGAINST LIVERPOOL 
WHY DOES IT MEAN SO MUCH TO THE

ASK RIGHT NOW WHAT SORT OF WELCOME 
AWAITS FANS IN MOSCOW LET'S TALK

YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ADVISE US ON 
HOW THE FANS CAN GET TO YOU AND 
THAT GAME 
YES I CAN ACTUALLY GIVE 
SOME ADVICE ON HOW FANS SHOULD GET 
VISAS ANOTHER HAS BEEN A LOT OF 
CONCERN ABOUT VISAS WE HAVE 
MANAGED TO CLARIFY HOW YOU SHOULD 
GO ABOUT DOING THAT THERE IS ONLY 
ONE PLACE FANS CAN GET VISAS FROM 
THAT IS NOT THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY IN 
LONDON THEY NEED TO GO TO THE 
RUSSIAN NATIONAL TOURIST OFFICE 
WEBSITE THAT IS W. W. W. VISIT RUSSIA 
D. O. T. ORGUK ON THAT SIDE THERE ARE

PASSPORT AND A COPY OF THEIR TICKET 
WITH THEIR NAME ON IT INTO THE POST 
AND SEND IT TO THE RUSSIAN NATIONAL 
TOURIST OFFICE IN LONDON THEY WILL 
ISSUE THE VISA IT WILL COST SIXTY FIVE 
PLUS FIVE FOR POSTAGE APPARENTLY 
THEY SAY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DEAL 
WITH ALL THE REQUESTS THERE WHAT WHAT ABOUT SOME OF THE STATE BECAUSE 
THERE ARE MORE SEATS IN THE STADIUM

THERE ARE IN MOSCOW THE MOSCOW 
HOTEL ASSOCIATION SAYS THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
WHICH ISN'T GOING TO BE ENOUGH 
ELSEWHERE THEY ARE SAYING THERE 
ARE SIXTY SIX THOUSAND HOTEL ROOMS IN MOSCOW 
EVEN THAT IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO 
BE ENOUGH IF YOU THINK FORTY TWO THOUSAND FANS 
WERE BECOMING AND THEN EVERYONE 
ELSE IT COMES TO MOSCOW ANYWAY THE 
ROOMS ARE ALSO VERY EXPENSIVE WE 
LOOK TO TRY TO BOOK A HOTEL ROOM 
YESTERDAY THE LOWEST QUOTE RIGGOTT 
WAS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY A NIGHT THAT GOES UP TO

BLITZ AND THE DOCUMENTARY LAST 
NIGHT YOU SAID THE WHOLE WORLD NOW

ARE YOU APPEALING FOR MORE 
INFORMATION IS THERE ANY MORE 
INFORMATION INFORMATION I THINK THERE IS MORE INFORMATION 
THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS WE ALWAYS 
SAID WE WOULD LEAVE NO STONE 
UNTURNED AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT 
INFORMATION IS IN THE INQUIRY WHAT 
HAS BEEN DONE AND WHAT HASN'T BEEN 
DONE I THINK IT IS UNLIKELY 
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DONE AND WE 
NEED TO KNOW THAT IT IS OUR 
DAUGHTER AND WE BELIEVE SHE IS OUT 
THERE PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE COME 
FORWARD FOR FOUR BEFORE THEY MAY 
HAVE COME FORWARD AND THAT 
INFORMATION MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SEEN 
AS RELEVANT WE WANT TO APPEAL TO 
PEOPLE AND THERE WAS GOING TO BE 
HUGE MEDIA ATTENTION ON US AND 
THIS IS TRYING TO CAPITALISE ON 
THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE MEDIA 
ATTENTION WHETHER WE PARTICIPATED 
OR NOT 
WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF E. 
MAILS FROM VIEWERS SOME CRITICAL 
AND SOME SUPPORTIVE 
ONE SAYS I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE 
BEEN ASKED US A MILLION TIMES BUT 
AS THE MOTHER OF A YOUNG TIRED 
CHILD HERSELF WHY YOU LEFT 
MADELEINE AND WENT OUT TO HAVE 
SOMETHING TO EAT 
PEOPLE STILL WANT THE ANSWER 
WE HAVE ANSWERED IT PERSONALLY I 
FEEL WE HAVE BEEN PERSECUTED ENOUGH 
ABOUT THIS MATTER WE DO THAT TO 
OURSELVES WE DON'T NEED TO KEEP 
GOING OVER IT L. HAVE SAID MANY 
TIMES I COULDN'T NORTH MADELEINE 
ANY MORE THAN I DO LOVED 
MADELEINE 
LISA FELT COMPLETELY MADELEINE SAFE IF WE HAD ANY INKLING IT WAS 
NOT SAFE WE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT 
THE SECOND THING IS WE CANNOT 
CHANGE IT WE DISCOVERED MADELEINE 
WAS TAKEN AND WE HAVE DONE 
EVERYTHING 
LET'S NOT FORGET THERE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN AN EVIL CRIME COMMITTED 
NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY SAYS ABOUT 
US IS IT RIGHT FOR SOMEBODY TO GO 
INTO YOUR APARTMENT AND TAKE A 
CHILD OUT OF HER BED 
IS THAT WHAT 
HAPPENED WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT 
MADELEINE WOKE UP AND WAS UPSET AND 
WANDERED OFF AND GOT LOST THAT WAY 
I KNOW THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED 
CANNOT GIVE TOO MANY DETAILS I 
KNOW MY DAUGHTER AND I KNOW WHAT I 
FOUND 
WE ARE IN A DIFFICULT FOUND SITUATION THE FIRE STILL UNDER 
SECRECY WE CANNOT GIVE 
INVESTIGATIONAL DETAIL THEREFORE 
THERE IS A NUMBER OF ISSUES ABOUT 
THE WAY THE ROOM WAS THE SITUATION 
AND WE ARE AS CERTAIN AS ANYONE CAN 
BE KNOWING THE FACTS WE KNOW WE WE KNOW MORE THAN THE PEOPLE STANDING 
UP THEIR GIVING OPINIONS ON 
SPECULATING 
YOU CANNOT TELL US SPECULATING THOSE FACTS BECAUSE YOU ARE STILL 
SUSPECTS 
NO IT IS BECAUSE OF SUSPECTS JUDICIAL SECRECY 
YOU SAID THERE 
MIGHT BE FOR MADELEINE AND SEAN WAS 
UPSET 
I DID NOT SAY THAT THAT UPSET THAT WAS IN A STATEMENT THAT WAS LEAKED 
WAS THAT NOT THE CASE THAT SHE WAS 
UPSET THE NIGHT BEFORE 
THE NEXT 
MORNING MADELEINE HAD SAID TO US 
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME IN WHEN WE 
CRIED LAST NIGHT WE THOUGHT IT WAS 
ODD AT THE TIME WE ASKED HER 
DIRECTLY WHEN SHE MEANT SHE 
DROPPED IT AND MOVED ON WHEN THEY 
HAVE BEEN CRYING WE HAVE BEEN 
CHECKING MID WOULD HAVE BEEN 
EXCEPTIONAL PARTICULARLY FOR THE 
TWINS TO CRY AND GO BACK TO SLEEP 
IN BETWEEN ART CHEQUES KIDS CRY 
ALL THE TIME WHEN THEY ARE GETTING 
BACK TIRED WE WONDER IF IT WAS 
WHEN THEY WERE GETTING PUT TO BED 
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER FOUR OZ 
EVERYTHING IS SEEN IN CONTEXT OF 
THE ABDUCTION AT THAT TIME WE 
WERE HAVING A RELAXED FAMILY 
HOLIDAY YES ANNE LITTLE 
HINDSIGHT IS A WONDERFUL THING

HER AS YET THEY ARE NOT ASKING 
MORE QUESTIONS WE CANNOT TELL THEM

ANOTHER ONE FROM A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD WHO 
ASKS A SIMILAR QUESTION LOTS OF 
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE DEEPLY 
CONCERNED AND HAVE BEEN ALL THIS 
TIME WHEN SHE IS COMING HOME 
ASKING THEIR PARENTS ALL THE TIME

MADELEINE MADELEINE IF THE TWINS ASKEW WERE MADELEINE 
IS WHAT WILL YOU TELL THEM WHAT 
FORM OF WORDS 
WE JUST SAY WE 
DON'T KNOW BUT WE ARE LOOKING FOR 
HER THAT 
IS ALL WE CAN SAVE SHE SHE IS LOST AND MISSING AND WE ARE 
LOOKING FOR HER THE FACT THAT SO 
MANY KIDS KNOW ABOUT MADELEINE IS 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION GOING OUT ON 
POSTERS IT MIGHT BE A CHILD WHO 
RECOGNISES MADELEINE THEY MAY SEE 
IT THROUGH DIFFERENT WAYS A CHANGE 
OF HER AND DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE 
THAT SO THAT PIECE OF INFORMATION 
COULD COME FROM A CHILD 
KIDS ARE 
AMAZING I HAVE HAD ANOTHER CHILD 
SAYING TO HIS MOTHER AND SAY THERE 
IS MADELEINE'S MONEY 
IT MAKES THEM 
VERY WORRIED CAROLYN SENDS AN E. 
MAIL SAYING A LOT OF CHILDREN ARE 
ASKING WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO BE 
ABDUCTED IN THE NIGHT AND OF THE 
PARENTS GOING TO PROTECT THEM IN A 
WAY SOMETIMES THIS IS CAUSING MORE 
CONCERN FOR CHILDREN L. KNOW HOW 
VALUABLE IT IS BUT CAN YOU SEE THE 
DIFFICULTY WITH PARENTS CONSTANTLY 
HAVING TO REASSURE THEIR CHILDREN 
THAT THEY WON'T GET SNATCHED IN THE 
NIGHT NIGHT EVERY PARENT KNOWS THEIR CHILD 
MOST PARENTS FIND IF THEY ARE 
HONEST WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND 
REASSURING 
THAT SITUATION IS REASSURING VERY MUCH IT IS TERRIBLE WE HAVE 
TO THINK LIKE THIS CLEARLY WHERE 
WE WERE AT THE TIME IT IN THE 
ENVIRONMENT IT WAS THE FIRST THIS 
THING FROM OUR MIND IT HAS BROUGHT 
THIS HOME THIS CAN HAPPEN IT IS 
MORE COMMON THAN WE THINK A LOT OF 
CRIMES ARE ON REPORTED MAYBE 
POSSIBLY EVEN UNDER REPORTED IN 
RETURNS TERMS OF OFFICIAL 
RECORDING IT IS TERRIBLE BUT IT 
IS REAL LIFE IT IS HORRIFIC AND IT 
IS A CRIME THERE IS AN ABDUCTOR 
OUT THERE AND THEY MAY STRIKE AGAIN 
I AM NOT SAYING EVERYONE SHOULD 
THINK ABOUT THAT IF YOU ARE IN A 
LOCKED APARTMENT HOUSE THE 
CHANCES ARE VERY SLIM 
CAN I ASK 
YOU ABOUT THE POLICE INQUIRY IN 
PORTUGAL HAVE YOU BEEN ASKED TO GO 
BACK AND TAKE PART IN A 
RECONSTRUCTION AND UNDER WHAT 
CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD YOU GO BACK 
THERE IS DIALOGUE BEING REPORTED 
THERE IS DATE OUT THERE AND IT IS 
UNDER DISCUSSION AND NO FINAL 
DECISION HAS BEEN MADE THE 
PROSPECT OF GOING BACK OF THE WORLD 
MEDIA TRYING TO WATCH A 
RECONSTRUCTION DOES NOT APPEAL AND 
HOW EMOTIONAL IT IS FOR US TO 
CONSIDER THAT THE OTHER ISSUE IS 
HOW MUCH MORE INFORMATION WILL THAT 
GET US ONE YEAR ON 
WE WILL DO 
ANYTHING IF WE BELIEVE IT WILL HELP 
TO FIND MADELEINE THAT IS THE 
ISSUE 
FAR FRIENDS HAVE TAKEN PART ISSUE IN RECENT INTERVIEWS IN 
LEICESTERSHIRE THEY HAVE GIVEN ALL 
THE INFORMATION AND HAVE HAD LOTS 
OF INFORMATION OUR FRIENDS STAYED 
IN PORTUGAL FOR TEN DAYS AFTER 
MADELEINE WAS TAKEN 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PUBLIC IS 
THINKING WHEN IT COMES TO THIS CASE 
IN THE DOCUMENTARY LAST NIGHT YOU 
HAD THOSE BOXES WITH THE LETTERS 
SUPPORTIVE LETTERS AND NASTY 
LETTERS CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHY 
PEOPLE ARE SO ANGRY ABOUT THIS THE 
FACT MADELEINE WENT MISSING AND WAY 
YOU WERE ON THE NIGHT

NASTY ONES ARE NOT ABOUT THAT SOME 
OF THE NASTY ONES ARE ALMOST NASTY

SHOCKING WE ARE NOT LIKE THAT AND 
WE DO NOT KNOW PEOPLE LIKE THAT IT 
IS QUITE SCARY AND AN EYE OPENER 
THAT PEOPLE CAN BE FILLED WITH SO 
MUCH VENOM WHAT EVER WE DO THEY

WAY OF THE WORLD ANYBODY IN THE 
PUBLIC EYE WILL GET IT MADELEINE MADELEINE IS A FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL A VICTIM

OUT UNINJURED 
THE NUMBERS OF 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO AT

IF YOU FANCY A GAMBLE HERE'S ONE 
THAT COULD BE GOLD PLATED YOU CAN 
BUY A SHARE IN TEN MILLION WORTH OF 
GOLD BULLION AND THAT WILL ONLY 
COST FIFTY THERE'S A DOWN SIDE 
THERE ALWAYS IS THE GOLD IS AT THE 
BOT O. SEA CHRIS BUTLER CAN TELL US 
MORE MORE THE LAURENTIC WAS A SHIP WITH QUITE 
A HISTORY AND STORY TO TELL IT WAS 
LAUNCHED FROM HERE IN BELFAST NINETY NINE 
YEARS AGO THIS WEEK IT SHARES 
SIMILARITIES WITH THE TITANIC PART 
OF THE WHITE STAR LINE IT WAS A 
PASSENGER LINER THAT CHANGED 
DURING THE WAR IT WAS ASKED TO 
CARRY GOLD BULLION TO CAN D. A. THE 
PROBLEM IS IN THE CASE OF THE GOLD 
IT WAS LOST AT SEA WHENEVER THE 
SHIP WENT DOWN TO PUT IT INTO 
CONTEXT IT WAS WORTH IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN MONEY 
FIVE MILLION NOW IT WOULD BE WORTH 
ONE BILLION IT ALL WENT UNDER THE 
WATER WATER THE LAURENTIC LIES FORTY METRES BELOW 
THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND SHE 
STILL HOLDS THE PROSPECT OF GOLD 
WHEN THE SHIP SANK OFF THE NORTH 
COAST OF IRELAND IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN SHE WAS 
CARRYING MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND GOLD BARS 
TWENTY OF THEM HAVE NEVER BEEN 
RECOVERED ON BOARD ANOTHER SHIP 
H. M. S. CAROLINE THE LAURENTIC WAS 
LAUNCHED AGAIN WITH PEOPLE GIVEN 
THE CHANCE TO BUY SHARES IN THE 
WRECK ALTHOUGH THERE'S LITTLE HOPE 
OF EVER FINDING THAT REMAINING TEN 
MILLION FORTUNE IN GOLD BULLION 
IT'S NOT AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY 
ALTHOUGH LOOKING AT THE PRICES IN 
HOUSES THESE DAYS IT MIGHTN'T BE 
BAD ONE IT'S A BIT OF FUN IT'S A 
BIT OF HISTORY IT'S A LOAD OF 
THINGS ALL MIXED UP IT'S CHANCE 
TO BUY INTO DREAM TO ACTUALLY 
OWN PART OF A WHITE STAR LINEER 
TO OWN A BULLION SHIP 
IT WAS BUILT 
AS A PASSENGER LINER BUT SHE WAS 
DRAFTED IN TO PLAY A PART IN THE 
FIRST WORLD WAR EFFORT THE GOLD 
BULLION WAS BEING TAKEN TO CANADA 
TO PAY FOR MUNITIONS WHEN SHE HIT 
MINES THERE WAS A DREADFUL LOSS OF 
LIFE AND THE GOLD WENT DOWN WITH 
THE SHIP 
IN LESS THAN A DECADE ROYAL NAVY 
DIVERS RECOVERED ALMOST ALL OF IT 
THE SALVAGE EFFORT WAS USED TO 
CREATE DECOMPRESSION TABLES STILL 
USED FOR SAFE DIVING 
THE DIVING 
EQUIPMENT ITSELF WAS THE WEIGHT 
ALONE FOR THE DIVER TO BE WALKING 
ALONG THE SEA BED WHERE WITH LARGE 
BOOTS AND A HELMET IT'S INCREDIBLE 
FEAT 
ON THE SEA BED AT LOUGH FEAT SWILLY THE SHIP STILL ATTRACTS 
DIVERS ALTHOUGH THEY'VE NOT FOUND 
GOLD THEY RECENTLY RECOVERED A GUN 
WHICH THEY PLAN TO PLACE AT THE 
LOCH LOOKING OUT TO SEA 
THE BOW IS 
FULLY IN TACT THE REST OF THE 
LAURENTIC IS SCRAP YARD STILL 
EVERY DIVER'S DREAM TO DIVE ON IT 
YOU HAVE THAT BUZZ THAT FEELING 
INCREDIBLE TO BE ON IT 
UNDER WATER 
THE GOLD IS NOT THE ONLY ATTRACTION 
JUST A PART OF THE LAURENTIC'S RICH 
HISTORY STILL BEING EXPLORED 
GREAT PICTURES THERE THAT'S ABOUT 
AS CLOSE AS YOU'LL GET TO THE GOLD 
THERE IS A SHARE CERTIFICATE PACK 
IT HAS PLENTY OF HISTORY ABOUT THE 
LAURENTIC AND THE WHITE STAR LINE 
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY GOLD BARS 
HOWEVER YOUR FIFTY QUID WON'T GET YOU 
ANY SHARE OF THAT GOLD 
IN A FEW MINUTES WE HAVE THE LATEST

SAT NAVS THEY'RE ALL FROM THAT ONE 
ADAPTER IN THE CAR L. WANT ONE OF

GOODBYE 
WELCOME BACK GREETING CARDS FOR 
CHRISTMAS BIRTHDAY MARRIAGE 
LEAVING HOME LEAVING A JOB 
PASSING A DRIVING TEST WE GET A 
CARD EVERY DAY FOR DOING BREAKFAST 
YES HATE MAIL COMING ONE A NEW 
REASON TO SENDING ONE IS NOT AS 
EASYS THE APPRENTICES MIGHT HAVE 
THOUGHT SOME DECISIONS WERE SIMPLE 
FOR KEVIN SHAW TO MAKE WHAT WAS 
THE BEST MAN TO MAKE THE PITCH 
DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU COULD GO IN 
THERE AND SMASH IT TO PIECES AND 
YOU ARE THE PERSON THAT THEY WOULD 
WANT TO BUY FROM 
YES DEFINITELY 
THIS FOR ME IT IS QUITE NORMAL L. 
DEAL WITH PITCHES EVERY SINGLE DAY 
I GO TO WORK IT DOES NOT REALLY 
PHASE ME A HUGE AMOUNT 
I THINK ON 
THIS OCCASION I WOULD FEEL EITHER 
JENNY OR CLAIRE WOULD BE MORE 
SUITED TO DO A PITCH 
I AM HUGELY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE 
SUBJECT I HAVE VERY STRONG SALES BACKGROUND 
FOR ME I AM TOTALLY BACKGROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PER CENT CONFIDENT I CAN GO IN THERE 
AND NAIL A PITCH L. KNOW I CAN DO 
THAT I WOULD REALLY RELISH THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT SO I THINK 
I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS JUST 
ENSURE THAT I CAN CAPTURE 
EVERYTHING THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO 
PUT INTO IT AND THEN I CAN PUT MY 
OWN PERSONALITY INTO IT 
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT LIKE THAT DID 
IT 
IT DIDN'T NO THE FIRST TWO IT PITCHES I WAS TRYING TO PITCH THE 
WAY THAT THE TEAM WANTED OR 
THOUGHT THE PITCH SHOULD GO 
IT WASN'T NECESSARILY THE WAY THEY 
MAY HAVE DONE IT YO SEE BY THE 
SECOND PITCH THEY GAVE SOME 
FEEDBACK IT WAS GOING DISASTROUSLY 
WRONG I SUPPOSE BY THE THIRD 
PITCH I DECIDED I WANTED TO SCRAP 
IT THE THIRD PITCH WENT WELL IT 
WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER 
WHAT I 
LIKE IS THE CONFIDENCE O. I. SAYING 
WHO HERE WANTS TO PITCH CLAIRE 
SAYS I WANT TO PITCH JENNY SAYS 
I WANT TO PITCH YOU SAY I TELL 
YOU WHAT I WILL DO IT WHY DID YOU 
NOT CHOSE THEM 
IN THE AAPPRENTICE 
YOU NEED TO TAKE YOURSELF OUT OF 
YOUR COMFORT ZONE THERE IS NO 
POINT GOING ON IF YOU ARE NOT 
PREPARED TO TAKE A RISK A 
CHALLENGE FOR ME IT WAS ABOUT MY 
PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT IF I AM GOING 
TO DO THINGS I AM COMFORTABLE IN 
DOING THEN I MAY AS WELL AS STAYED 
IN MY EXISTING JOB 
LET'S SEE HOW 
WELL YOUR PITCH WENT 
FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR 
MILLION TONNES OF RUBBISH IS THON 
AWAY EACH YEAR IN THE U. K. 
SEVENTEEN BILLION PLASTIC BAGS ARE ALSO 
THROWN AWAY 
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT A BASIC 
STRAIGHTFORWARD CARD COULD START TO 
CHANGE THE WAY WE WORK TRAVEL 
LIVE AND HAVE FUN TOGETHER L. OPEN 
THE NOW TO QUESTIONS 
WHO DO YOU 
THINK WILL BUY THESE CARDS 
YOU ARE NOT HAVING FUN THERE I 
THINK IT IS JENNY'S GRIN WHICH DID 
FOR THAT PITCH AS WELL IF SOMEBODY 
GRINNED AT ME HOLDING CARD LIKE 
THAT I WOULD SAY OUT NOW THE THE PITCH AND THE IDEA WEREN'T 
APPROPRIATE FOR THAT TASK 
YOU WERE 
THE PROJECT MANAGER THE IDEA IS 
IT IS LIKE IT HAPPENED WITH SIMON A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO HE SAID I WILL 
TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT DID FOR 
HIM AS WELL FATAL DECISION 
WHAT YOU HAVE TO STAND BACK 
RECOGNISE OTHER TALENT AND SAY I 
CAN DO THIS BIT BUT I AM BETTER AT 
THAT 
I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT REFLECTION THAT IS SOMETHING I 
SHOULD HAVE DONE L. THINK FOR ME I 
FELT THAT AS A PROJECT MANAGER YOU 
NEED TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY 
ONE COULD ARGUE HAD I NOT DONE THE 
PITCH SIR ALAN MIGHT HAVE TURNED 
AROUND AND SAID WHAT DID YOU DO 
YOU DID NOT COME UP WITH THE IDEA 
YOU DIDN'T DO THE PITCH IT IS A 
DECISION YOU NEED TO MAKE LET'S 
NOT FORGET YOU ONLY HAVE A SHORT 
PERIOD OF TIME IT IS NOT LIKE WE 
CAN PLAN FOR WEEKS THEN GO AHEAD 
AND EXECUTE IT L. CAN CONQUUR WITH 
THAT SIR ALAN MADE THE RIGHT 
DECISION ON THAT TASK 
YOU THINK IT 
WAS THE RIGHT DECISION IN THE END 
AS A BUSINESS LEADER OR PROJECT 
MANAGER YOU HAVE TO TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ME I FELT THAT 
BASED ON THAT TASK I SHOULD GO YOU 
KNOW I WANTED TO GO INTO THE 
BOARDROOM ON MY OWN IF I COULD 
HAVE I WOULD HAVE YOU DON'T HAVE 
THAT OPTION ON THE APPRENTICE 
SHALL WE LOOK AT YOU GRASPING THE 
NETTLE WITH BOTH HANDS 
I WOULD 
WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU ARE DIFFERENT 
FROM MY COMPETITION L. WOULD SAY 
HOW DO YOU KNOW L. WOULD WANT TO 
KNOW WHAT RESEARCH YOU HAVE DONE 
IF YOU WERE STOOD IN FRONT OF THESE 
PEOPLE DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD 
REMEMBER FROM START TO FINISH THAT 
COMPLETE PROCESS IS THAT JUST 
EMBEDDED IN YOU YEAH 
IT IS NOT YEAH BETTER TO GET THE PERSON WITH MOST 
EXPERIENCE IN THAT PEELD TO DO IT 
YOU UNDERSTAND THE INDUSTRY 
NO I 
THINK JENNY SHOULD DO THE PITCH I I AM LOVING HOW ALL OF A SUDDEN IT IS 
COMING BACK TO ME L. WOULD HAVE 
BEEN HAPPY TO DO THIS PITCH HAD I 
KNOWN YESTERDAY L. ASKED 
SPECIFICALLY I WOULD HAVE BEEN 
DELIGHTED TO DO IT TWO HOURS 
BEFORE I AM NOT HAPPY TO GO IN AND 
DO A PITCH 
IT IS NO PROBLEM IT IS 
FINE WE WILL MOVE ON 
THAT IS WHAT 
IS CALLED A HOSPITAL PASS YOU 
KNOW 
WHAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW 
IS THAT KNOW IS WHAT WE AGREED WITH REGARDS TO 
THE PITCH THE PITCH WAS MEANT TO 
START THE PREPARATIONS WERE MEANT 
TO START AT ONE HUNDRED P. M. THE GUYS GOT 
BACK LATE THEY GOT BACK AT TWENTY THREE THIRTY P. M. 
WHEN I SAW HOWAL LANTED CLAIRE WAS 
YOU KNOW I REALISED THAT MAYBE YOU 
WERE OVERCONFIDENT AND YOU WEREN'T 
THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB L. 
WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS A HOSPITAL 
PITCH I WOULD SAY THAT ACTUALLY I 
REALISE I HAD MADE A BAD DECISION 
I WAS PREPARED TO THROW MY HANDS UP 
AND SAY THAT BUT YOU KNOW THEY 
WERE NOT CONFIDENT TO GO AHEAD WITH 
IT I SAID FINE I HAVE MADE THAT 
MISTAKE I WILL TAKE RESPONSEN'T RESPONSIBILITY WHAT IS 
UNCOMFORTABLE IS THERE SEEMS TO BE 
GANGING UP ON OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 
TEAM DON'T YOU THINK ALAN SUGAR 
SAYS HE RECOGNISES WITH SARA FOR 
EXAMPLE WHEN SHE WAS CALLED 
EVERYBODY PICKED ON HER IT SEEMED 
UNFAIR SHE CAME ONE THE EID IDEA 
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A GREAT IDEA 
FOR A GREETINGS CARD 
WHAT YOU NEED 
TO UNDERSTAND IS THE EID IDEA HAS 
ALREADY BEEN DONE THE IDEA HAD TO 
BE COMPLETELY UNIQUE ALL VERY WELL 
SAYING PET'S BIRTHDAY OR PET'S 
BEREAVEMENT CARD THEY ARE ALREADY 
OUT THERE IN THE SHOPS THE IDEA 
HAD TO BE COMPLETELY UNIQUE THERE 
WERE LOTS OF IDEA WE PUT TO THE 
TABLE HOWEVER THEY HAD ALL BEEN 
DONE

TO BE DONE ISN'T THERE A BIT OF 
YOU WHICH FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH 
THE BACK BITING AND YOU ARE AT 
FAULT NOT ME ALL THAT SORT OF 
STUFF 
IF YOU WATCH ANY BOARDROOM STUFF IT IS THE SAME WHEN IAN WAS FIRED 
EVERYBODY SAID HE SHOULD GO BUT 
NO ONE HAS COMMENTED ON THE FACT 
THAT EVERYONE IN THE BOARDROOM SAID
