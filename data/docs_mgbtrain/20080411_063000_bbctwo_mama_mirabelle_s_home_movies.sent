HOW DID YOU EVER MEET GLYNNIS MAMA 
WELL NOW THAT'S A GOOD STORY 
IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME AGO NOW 
OH IT WAS GLYNNIS 
BUT I REMEMBER IT LIKE YESTERDAY 
I WAS ON AN ADVENTURE VISITING SOUTH AMERICA 
EVERYONE SAID I JUST HAD TO SEE THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS 
BUT NO ONE TOLD ME WHAT TO DO ONCE I GOT THERE 
SOMETIMES IF A PLACE IS REALLY NEW AND DIFFERENT 
IT CAN BE QUITE HARD TO FIND YOUR WAY AROUND 
BUT IT WAS BEAUTIFUL THERE 
SO MANY NEW AND INTERESTING CREATURES 
LIKE LIZARDS WHO SWIM 
OR BIRDS WHO DON'T FLY 
AND OTHER BIRDS WITH BRIGHT BLUE FEET 
YES I'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE 
AND THEY'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE ME 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAY WAS UP OR WHERE TO GO FIRST 
WHAT DID YOU DO DID YOU RUN

I WAS A CURIOUS AS A CAT IN A CORNFIELD 
I DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER ANYONE BUT I DID NEED SOME HELP 
EXCUSE ME 
YOU'RE NEW AROUND HERE AREN'T YOU 
WHY YES I AM HOW DID YOU KNOW 
THIS PLACE CAN BE CONFUSING WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVE 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR MAP UPSIDE DOWN 
AND WE'VE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS EVER SINCE 
WITHOUT GLYNNIS'S HELP I'D NEVER HAVE MADE MY MOVIE 
ABOUT THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS

TO MAMA MIRABELLE'S BIG HOME MOVIE SHOW 
P. A. A. DOUBLE A. A. A. R. U. M. P. 
FIREFLIES LIGHT IT UP 
MY TRIP TO THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS 
THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS ARE MOSTLY OLD VOLCANOES 
THAT STICK UP OUT OF THE OCEAN 
THERE ARE NINETEEN SMALL ISLANDS 
AND LOTS AND LOTS OF REALLY SMALL ISLANDS 
WOO 
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO FAR FROM OTHER LAND 
ALL KINDS OF INTERESTING AND RARE ANIMALS LIVE THERE 
REMEMBER THOSE SWIMMING LIZARDS 
MARINE IGUANAS THE ONLY LIZARD IN THE WORLD THAT SWIMS IN THE SEA 
AND SOME VERY CLOSE FRIENDS OF MINE 
HE'S HUNGRY FOR SOME SEAWEED 
HOW LONG CAN THEY STAY UNDERWATER 
THEY CAN STAY UNDER FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR 
THEN THEY GET COLD AND HAVE TO LIE IN THE SUN 
THIS IS A KIND OF CORMORANT THAT DOESN'T FLY 
THAT MUST BE WHY IT'S WINGS ARE SO SMALL 
THESE ARE BLUE FOOTED BOOBIES 
THAT'S THE DANCE THEY DO WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A MATE SEE 
THE BOYS ARE TRYING TO IMPRESS THE GIRLS WITH THEIR PRETTY BLUE FEET 
AH THIS IS MY FOOT AND THIS IS MY OTHER FOOT 
THIS IS MY FOOT AND THIS IS MY OTHER FOOT HA HA 
AND THESE ARE THE GALAPAGOS PENGUINS 
I THOUGHT PENGUINS ONLY LIVED WHERE IT WAS COLD 
NOT THE GALAPAGOS PENGUINS 
LOOK AT THEM CHASE THE FISH 
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE PUSHING THEM INTO ONE BIG GROUP 
YES EXACTLY MAXIE 
SO IT'S EASIER TO CATCH THEM FOR DINNER 
OH THEY'RE GETTING THE PENGUINS FISH HA HA THEY ARE 
BUT THE PELICANS BIG POUCHES GET SO FULL OF WATER 
THEY CAN'T FLY AWAY 
WOW THAT LOOKS HEAVY 
AND I THINK YOU RECOGNISE THESE 
JUST LIKE GLEN AND GLYNNIS 
YES GALAPAGOS TORTOISES 
SO WHY DO YOU MOVE SO SLOWLY 
WELL WE CARRY OUR HOMES ON OUR BACKS IS THAT WHAT THOSE ARE 
YES AND GALAPAGOS TORTOISES CAN LIVE TO BE OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OLD 
SO 
WE DON'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN TOO MUCH OF A HURRY HA HA 
THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS LOOK GREAT 
I'D REALLY LIKE TO GO THERE SOME TIME 
SOME DAY WE'LL GO AND VISIT MAXIE 
IT'S PRETTY NICE AND WE'D LOVE YOU TO VISIT ANY TIME 
OOH I'VE GOT AN IDEA 
SINCE YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY 
WE SHOULD SHOW GLEN THE SAVANNAH 
YES LIKE THE WATERING HOLE AND THE BIG HILL AND GERALD THE GIRAFFE 
AND KIP FLIP AND CHIP 
UH DID I MENTION THAT THE CHEETAH IS THE FASTEST LAND ANIMAL 
YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THAT YEAH 
LIKE I ALWAYS SAY 
KEEP YOUR EYES AND YOUR MIND OPEN TO NEW THINGS 
AND YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF ADVENTURES YOU'LL HAVE 
SEE YOU ON THE SAVANNAH
