MAIN RATE IS NOW TWO PER CENT BUT EXPERTS 
QUESTION HOW EFFECTIVE THE MOVE 
WILL BE 
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TODAY 
MAY HAVE SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT 
FOR THE FINANCIAL MARKETS BUT ON 
THE REAL ECONOMY HAS VERY LITTLE 
IMPACT 
WE WILL BE ASKING HOW THE IMPACT AMERICAN CUT WILL AFFECT THE STATE 
OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY ALSO 
TONIGHT ENJOYING A BREAK JOSEF 
FRITZL ON HOLIDAY WHILE HIS 
DAUGHTER AND THEIR CHILDREN WERE 
LOCKED UP AT HOME WE REVEAL THE 
LATEST EVIDENCE OF VIOLENCE IN 
ZIMBABWE AS RUMOURS GROW ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENTAL VOTE THE PIONEERING 
POWDER TREATMENT WHICH ALLOWED A 
SEVERED FINGER TO GROW AGAIN 
A STRONG START FOR CHELSEA AT 
STAMFORD BRIDGE TONIGHT WAS IT 
ENOUGH TO SEE OFF LIVERPOOL 
ON B. B. C. LONDON WHO WILL GET YOUR 
VOTE THE MAIN CANDIDATES EXPLAIN 
WHY IT SHOULD BE THEM CAUGHT ON 
KAMARA FINES FOR THE PARENTS 
DROPPING THEIR KIDS OFF AT THE 
SCHOOL 
GOOD EVENING FOR THE SEVENTH TIME 
IN SEVEN MONTHS THE U. S. FEDRAL 
RESERVE HAS CUT ITS KEY INTEREST 
RATE IT NOW STANDS AT TWO PER CENT AS THE 
CENTRAL BANK TRIES TO HEAD OFF A 
WIDESPREAD RECESSION CONSUMER 
DEMAND THERE IS FRAGILE THE 
HOUSING MARKET IS WEAK SOME U. S. 
COMMENTATORS INSIST THE RECESSION 
HAS TAKEN HOLD AS JUSTIN WEBB 
REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON THE 
AUTHORITIES ARE HOPING THAT NO MORE 
REDUCTIONS WILL BE NEEDED THE 
DOLLAR WILL RALLY IN AN ECONOMY 
AS FRAGILE AS AMERICA'S THIS WAS 
BIG NEWS 
THE CUT WAS EXPECTED BUT THE 
ACCOMPANYING STATEMENT CONFUSED 
WALL STREET THE MARKETS FELL AMID 
SOME DOUBT OVER WHETHER THE FED 
THINKS SEVEN INTEREST RATE CUTS IN 
THE ROW MIGHT BE ENOUGH OR WHETHER 
FURTHER CUTS ARE PLANNED TO STAVE 
UEF RECESSION IN THE WORLD'S 
BIGGEST ECONOMY THE SIGNS OF 
DISTRESS ARE EVERYWHERE THIS IS A 
BUS TOUR OF RECENTLY REPOSSESSED 
HOUSES IN RELATIVELY WEALTHY 
WASHINGTON THE ESTATE AGENTS ARE 
HOPING TO KICK START THE MARKET 
BUT THE BUYERS KNOW THAT THEY ARE 
IN CHARGE THEY ARE IN NO HURRY 
PRICES COULD FALL FURTHER THAT IS 
THE POINT OF OF TODAY'S RATE CUT AN 
EFFORT TO PERSUADE AMERICANS TO 
SPEND AGAIN ON HOUSES ON CARS ON 
RESTAURANT MEALS ANYTHING THAT 
FEEDS BACK INTO ECONOMIC GROWTH 
NEED A LITTLE MORE ENCOURAGEMENT 
HOW ABOUT A REBATE CHEQUE FROM THE 
TAXMAN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION ARE BEING SENT 
OUT OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL 
ALL THIS PERSUADE HARD PRESSED 
AMERICANS THAT CHRISTMAS HAS COME 
EARLY WITH PETROL PRICES REACHING 
RECORD HIGHS THE RISK IS THEY USE 
EXTRA MONEY IN WAY THAT IS DON'T 
REALLY HELP MANY AMERICANS DRIVE 
PRIVATE CAR THE RISK IS THEY USE 
THE TAX REBEAT TO BUY FUELS 
BOOSTING THE PROFITS OF THE OIL 
COMPANIES BUT DOING LITTLE OR 
NOTHING FOR THE WIDER AMERICAN 
ECONOMY JOHN TAYLOR OWN THAT IS 
TRUCK AND HAS TO FILL THE TANK 
TODAY WAS TOPPING UP A COMPLETE 
REFILL IS OVER ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS DOUBLE WHAT 
IT WAS A YEAR AGO STILL AS WE 
HEADED OUT OF WASHINGTON MR. TAYLOR 
GAVE A GLIMMER OF HOPE CHEERED BY 
THE INTEREST RATE CUT HE WILL SPEND 
THE TAX REBEAT FRIV ROUSELY 
I WILL 
SPEND IT L. MAY TAKE MY WIFE AND 
FAMILY OUT TO DINNER L. MIGHT SAY 
WELL WE GOT TO GET DINNER LET'S GO 
OUT AND HAVE A GOOD DINNER 
AMERICA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH IS 
STALLED TODAY'S DOMESTIC PRODUCT 
FIGURES SUGGEST THE ECONOMY IS WEAK 
IT HAS NOT COLLAPSED MR. TAYLOR AND 
MILLIONS LIKE HIM COULD RESCUE IT 
SO WHAT IS THIS LIKELY TO MEAN R. 
THE U. S. ECONOMY IN THE FIRST PLACE 
IN THE COMING MONTHS HOW WILL THAT 
IN TURPBL AFFECT THE BRITISH 
OUTLOOK HERE TO COMPLAIN EXPLAIN 
IS OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR STEPHANIE 
FLAUNDERS THERE WERE TWO BIG 
QUESTIONS OUT OF THE RATE CUT DO 
THEY NOW THINK THEY HAVE DONE 
ENOUGH TO LOOSEN THE SQUEEZE ON THE 
U. S. ECONOMY WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR 
ALL OF US THE BEST THING THAT 
COULD HAPPEN IN THE U. S. IS THAT 
GROWTH COMES BACK VERY QUICKLY SO 
IT'S V. SHAPED RECOVERY THE 
CENTRAL BANK DOESN'T HAVE TO CUT 
AGAIN BUT THE SLOW DOWN COULD BE 
MORE DRAWN OUT 
MORE LIKE U. THAT MIGHT LEAVE THE 
FED WITH MORE TO DO WE MAY NOT 
KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE 
ECONOMY FOR QUITE WHILE 
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TODAY MAY HAVE 
SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT FOR THE 
FINANCIAL MARKETS BUT ON THE REAL 
ECONOMY HAS VERY LITTLE IMPACT 
UNTIL MAYBE A YEAR FROM NOW OR SO 
BOTH B. T. THE FED HAS DONE PLENTY 
ALREADY IT HAS CUT SEVEN TIMES 
SINCE SEPTEMBER BY MORE THAN THREE 
PERCENTAGE POINT THE BANK BANK 
OF ENGLAND HAS CUT THREE TIMES 
PRESIDENT BUSH HOPES THE SPECIAL 
TAX REBATES THAT STARTED BEING SENT 
THOUGHT WEEK WILL SUPPORT THE 
ECONOMY OVER THE SUMMER WE DON'T 
KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER THAT 
TEMPORARY BOOST WEARS OFF 
WITH THE HOUSING MARKET STILL IN 
FREE FALL THE PESSIMISTS SAY THE U. S. 
ECONOMY WILL GO UP AND DOWN AGAIN 
TIGER WOODS THE END OF THE YEAR 
THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT A W. SHAPED 
RECESSION INSTED STEAD 
THAT COULD MAKE FOR MORE OF 
SQUEEZE OVER HERE 
THE LONGER THE DOWN TURN IN THE U. S. 
THE MORE OF A DIRECT HIT WE WILL 
SEE FROM LOWER DEMAND FOR BRITISH 
GOODS WE ARE GOING INTO THE SLOW 
DOWN WITH MANY OF THE SAME ECONOMIC 
PROBLEMS AS AMERICA IT COULD ALSO 
BE A SIGN OF WHAT IS TO COME THE THE U. S. IS AHEAD OF US IN THE CYCLE BY 
PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR QUARTERS L. 
THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE NOW 
IS GIVING US A STRONG PREVIEW IF 
YOU LIKE OF WHAT MIGHT BE 
HAPPENING IN OUR OWN ECONOMY 
FURTHER AHEAD 
OF COURSE WE HAVE ONE BIG 
ADVANTAGE OVER THE U. S. IT'S ALL 
HAPPENED THERE FIRST 
OUR POLICY MAKE VERSE CHANCE TO 
LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES THAT 
SHOULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

IMAGES THIS IS THE PRICE OF 
OPPOSITION TO ROBERT MUGABE SOME 
SUPPORTERS OF THE MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE ARE BEING BURNT 
OUT OF THEIR HOMES ALL PART OF 
WHAT HUMAN RIGHTS WORKERS CALL AN 
ESCALATING CAMPAIGN OF STATE 
SPONSORED TERROR THIS WOMAN HAS 
RETURNED FROM ZIMBABWE SHE SAYS 
THE VIOLENCE IS AT ITS MOST BRUTAL 
IN A BROAD SWATHE OF THE NORTH EAST 
OF THE COUNTRY FORMER GOVERNMENT 
STRONG HOLDS WHERE THE OPPOSITION 
DID WELL 
I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE BEING 
BEAT WITHIN ROCKS AND STONES IN 
ONE INCIDENT FOUR M. D. C. SUPPORTERS 
WERE KNOCKED OVER BY A CAR AND BEAT 
WITHIN IRON BARS AND LOGS WE 
DOCUMENTED ONE INCIDENT ONE ONE 
MAN'S EAR WAS CUT OFF HORRIBLE 
HORRIBLE VIOLENCE 
NIGHT IS OFTEN 
THE MOST TERRIFYING TIME

INCREASING CONCERN ABOUT REPORTS OF 
TORTURE CAMPS MORE THAN A MONTH 
SINCE ZIMBABWEAN'S VOTED THERE IS 
NO OFFICIAL WORD ON WHO WON THE 
PRESIDENTAL POLL FROM TOMORROW A 
PROCESS WILL BEGIN TO VERIFY THE 
LONG AWAITED RESULTS THE 
GOVERNMENT IT SEEMS IS HOPING FOR 
A RUN OFF IT'S TRYING TO ENSURE 
THAT IN FUTURE PEOPLE ARE TOO 
SCARED TO VOTE FOR ANYONE OTHER 
THAN ROBERT MUGABE 
COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
PLENTY OF CHAMPIONS LEAGUE DRAMA AT 
CHELSEA TONIGHT AS LIVERPOOL STRIKE 
BACK 
SCIENTISTS IN THE UNITED STATES 
HAVE PRODUCED WHAT SOME ARE CALLING 
A MIRACLE MEDICAL POWDER THE 
SUBSTANCE WHICH STIMLAITS THE 
BODY'S CELLS HAS ALLOWED SEVERED 
FINGERS TO GROW AND REFORM THE 
ARMED FORCES ARE AMONG THE GROUPS 
EXPRESSING INTEREST IN THE POWDER'S 
POTENTIAL THIS REPORT CONTAINS 
STRONG IMAGES CINCINATTI IS NOT A 
PLACE YOU WOULD EXPECT TO MEET A 
MEDICAL MIRACLE 
THAT IS JUST WHAT LEE SPIEVACK IS 
CONVINCED HE IS 
I PUT MY FINGER L. SAID YOU NEED TO 
GET RID OF THAT AEROPLANE THAT IS 
WHEN I CUT MY FINGER OUT 
SLICED IT 
OFF 
TOOK IT OFF WE DON'T KNOW OFF WHERE THE PIECE WENT WE NEVER DID 
FIND IT 
HOW MUCH OF THE FINGER 
PROBABLE THAT MUCH OF THE FINGER 
THE PHOTOS OF HIS SEVERED FINGER 
ARE GRAPHIC YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY 
DOCTORS SAID HE LOST IT FOR GOOD 
IT GREW BACK WITH THE HELP OF A 
MYSTERY POWDER NERVES TISSUE 
BLOOD VESSELS SKIN IN JUST FOUR 
WEEKS MIRACLE MAN SPRINKLES 
MIRACLE POWDER ON HIS FINGER PIXIE PIXIE DUST 
THEY CALL IT PIXIE DUST THEY DUST SPRINKLE AND IT GREW BACK WAS IT 
LIKE 
THAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I DID 
THIS IS WHERE THE PIXIE DUST DID COMES FROM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
PITTSBURGH THEY CALL IT 
EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX THEY SCRAPE 
THE CELL FROM PIGS' BLADDER DRY 
OUT THE TISSUE AND FORM SHEETS OR 
POWDER WHEN WE ARE WOUNDED WE SCAR 
THE SCIENTISTS SAY PUTTING THE 
EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX ON THE WOUND 
STIMULATES THE CELLS TO REGROW 
INSTEAD THEY HOPE THE TECHNIQUE 
MIGHT WORK ON ORGANS AND POSSIBLY 
MORE 
I THINK THAT WITHIN TEN YEARS MORE I DON'T THINK THAT WE WILL BE ABLE 
TO REGROW A NORMAL LIMB FOR YOU I 
DOLL THINK THOUGH THAT WE WILL HAVE 
STRATEGIES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO 
RECONSTRUCT THE BONES AND TO 
PROMOTE THE GROWTH OF FUNCTIONAL 
TISSUE AROUND THE BONES MUSCLE 
TENDON UNITS THAT IS A MAJOR STEP 
TOWARDS THE EVENTUALUAL DOING THE 
ENTIRE LIMB 
THAT KIND OF TALK HAS GOT THE U. S. 
MILITARY INTERESTED 
THEY ARE JUST ABOUT TO START TRIALS 
TO REGROW PARTS OF THE FINGERS OF 
INJURED SOLDIERS 
THEY ALSO HOPE THAT THE MATRIX 
MIGHT HELP VETERANS LIKE ROBERT 
REGROW BURNT SKIN ANYTHING THAT 
COULD BE DONE IN TERMS OF 
REGENERATION WOULD BE GREAT LIFE GREAT LIFE CHANGING 
BIG LIFE CHANGING ANY CHANGING SURGERY YOU DON'T WANT TO DO 
ANOTHER ONEENING I'M MORE SCARED 
OF HOSPITALS THAN I AM GOING BACK 
TO IRAQ AGAIN 
LIKE ANY DEVELOPING 
TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE MANY UNKNOWNS 
HERE THEY BELIEVE THAT WITHIN THE 
SO CALLED PIXIE DUST LIES AN 
AMAZING MEDICAL DISCOVERY 
GORDON BROWN HAS ADMIT THE HE MADE 
MISTAKES WHEN HE ABOLISHED THE TEN P. 
RATE OF INCOME TAX HE IS DOING HIS 
BEST TO SORT IT OUT HIS EMISSIONS 
CAME ON THE EVE OF LOCAL ELECTIONS 
IN GALES NICK ROBINSON EXPLAINS 
WHAT IS IN STAKE EVERY COUNCIL IS 
DIFFERENT EVERY ELECTION LOCAL THE 
RESULTS COULD BE THE BUILDING 
BLOCKS FOR NATIONAL SUCCESS 
READING HAS BEEN LABOUR RED 
THROUGHOUT THE BLAIR YEARS READING 
HAS BEEN A SYMBOL OF THE FACT THAT 
NEW LABOUR COULD DO WELL IN THE 
SOUTH OF ENGLAND WHERE PEOPLE WERE 
PROSPERING AS THE ECONOMY IS 
TURNING HERE AND ELSEWHERE THE 
QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS YEAR 
LABOUR'S POLITICAL FORTUNES IN THE 
SOUTH WILL TURN AS WELL WHEN HI 
TECH READING BOOMED LABOUR BOOMED 
WITH IT NOW THE DOUBTS ARE 
CREEPING IN MUMS WHO ONCE VOTED 
LABOUR AND LIB DEM ARE 
CONTEMPLATING A CHANGE 
I WANT TO 
SEE SOMETHING KNEW I WANT TO NEW 
I WANT TO SEE IF THEY HAVE 
SOMETHING TO OFFER 
I FEEL I SHOULD 
BE THROIL LABOUR THINGS ARE SO 
HARD SO DIFFICULT YOU WORK SO 
HARD AND YOU SEEM TO HAVE NOTHING 
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW 
THE THINGS LIKE FUEL PRICES ARE 
RIDICULOUS COUNCIL TAX IS 
RIDICULOUS I'D LIKE TO BUY MY OWN 
HOUSE THERE IS NO WAY I CAN DO 
THAT I HAVE QUITE GOOD MONEY 
COMING IN IT WOULD BE INTERESTING 
TO LOOK AT WHAT CONSERVATIVES CAN 
OFFER 
IN THE SOUTH ISN'T OFFER ENOUGH FOR THE TORIES TO GET BACK 
INTO GOVERNMENT THEY NEED TO PAINT 
THE TOWNS OF THE NORTH BLUE 
PLACES LIKE BRADFORD WHICH THEY 
ONCE CONTROLLED 
PRIVATELY TEAM CAMERON WORRY ABOUT 
WHY WEST YORKSHIRE HAS REMAIN SOD 
RESISTANT TO THEIR CHARMS 
SIMMERING ANXIETY ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
MAY JUST CHANGE THAT BRADFORD'S 
CURRY KING IS FEELING THE HEAT IN 
HIS RESTAURANT AND IN HIS FACTORY 
ALL THE CUSTOMER WHOSE COME TO OUR 
REST RAUPBLT THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
THEIR HOUSES RESTAURANT THEIR 
BUSINESSES YOU KNOW FOR US 
PERSONALLY IT'S MAECKING US 
AFFECTING NEWS THE MANUFACTURING 
SIDE 
DOWN THE ROAD IT IS QUIZ SIDE NIGHT BEGINNING TONIGHT WITH A 
LIMERICK COMPETITION THE FIRST 
LINE IS THE LESS WELL OFF PAY MORE 
TAX I'D LIKE TO KICK BROWN IN THE 
NATTS HE CONNED US ONCE AND HE'S 
CONS US TWICE HE DOESN'T DONE A 
YEAR YET GORDON BROWN WHAT DO YOU 
MAKE OF HIM 
I DON'T THINK HE WILL 
DO TWO DO YOU 
FOR MANY HERE 
NOTHING WILL MAKE THEM VOTE TORY 
COMPARED WITH MARGARET THATCHER'S 
YEARS I WILL SETTLE FOR TONY BLAIR 
GORDON BROWN I'D SETTLE FOR 
RAVING LOONEY PARTY BEFORE I HAVE 
HER BACK 
LOCAL ELECTIONS ARE THAT 
LOCAL EVERY PLACE DIFFERENT THERE 
ARE SIGNS OF A NEW NATIONAL MOOD A 
MOOD OF UNCERTAINTY UNCERTAINTY 
ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT UNCERTAINTY 
ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVES BUT ABOVE 
ALL ABOUT THE FUTURE NICK HAS 
MOVED FROM THERE TO THE PALACE OF 
WESTMINSTER YOU WERE FOCUSING ON I 
SUPPOSE NATIONAL THEMES LOTS OF 
TOMORROW'S CONTESTS WILL BE DECIDED 
ON LOCAL ISSUES WON'T THEY 
WHETHER IT IS THE BINS OR COUNCIL 
TAX OR BUSNESS LONDON PEOPLE WILL 
VOTE IN HUGE NUMBERS ABOUT THAT IT 
IS A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO GET 
TO VOTE EVERYBODY IN WALES HAVE 
THE CHANCE TO VOTE FOR THEIR 
COUNCIL ALMOST SIXTY PER CENT OF THE 
POPULATION IN ENGLAND VOTES FOR 
LONDON MAYOR OR COUNCIL POLITICS 
IS A TEAM SPORT T. DEPENDS ON MORALE 
AND BUILDING SUCCESS SLOWLY THAT'S 
WHY THERE'S NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE 
IN THESE LOCAL ELECTIONS GORDON 
BROWN'S KNOWS IF KEN LIVINGSTONE 
LOST IN LONDON AND THERE WERE MANY 
COUNCILLORS LOST FOR THE LABOUR 
PARTY OR VOTE SHARE WAS LOW THAT 
WOULD FUEL DOUBTS ABOUT HIS 
PREMIERSHIP ON THE OTHER HAND IF 
HE DOES BETTER THAN THAT IF THE 
PARTY DOESN'T DO TOO BADLY THE 
QUESTIONS WILL GO TO DAVID CAMERON 
IS HE DOING WELL ENOUGH GIVEN THE 
PROBLEMS FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND 
NICK CLEGG HIS FIRST TEST FOR THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HUGE GAINS IN 
THE PAST WHEN THEY WERE POPULAR 
AFTER THE IRAQ WAR STRUGGLING 
PERHAPS TOMORROW AND THEY WILL LOOK 
FOR ANY EVIDENCE THEY CAN FIND THAT 
THEY ARE NOT MOVING BACKWARDS 
THESE WILL SET THE CONTEXT FOR THE 
POLITICAL YEAR AHEAD 
THANK YOU FOOTBALL NOW THEN AND 
WE KNOW IT WILL BE AN ALL ENGLISH 
AFFAIR BUT WHOSE JOINED MANCHESTER 
UNITED IN THE FINAL OF THE 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE ADAM IS AT 
STAMFORD BRIDGE WHERE CHELSEA HAS 
BEEN TAKING ON LIVERPOOL OVER TO

LAMPARD'S PENALTY A FEW DAYS AFTER 
THE DEATH OF HIS MOTHER HIS A 
CELEBRATION DRENCHED IN EMOTION 
DROGBA ADDED THIRD FOR CHELSEA 
ALTHOUGH LIVERPOOL PULLED IT BACK

MOSCOW WHAT ABOUT THEIR SUPPORTERS 
GETTING TO THE STUEEDIUM COULD BE 
ENOUGH TO DEFLATE ANYONE'S 
CELEBRATIONS THE CHEAPEST MATCH 
TICKET IS MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED FLIGHT 
NINE HUNDRED THEN THERE'S THE HARDEST PART 
THE VEESA 
THE OWE OWEMANS AREN'T 
GOOD WHEN ENGLAND PLAYED IN RUSSIA 
IN OCTOBER THE FIXTURE WAS KNOWN 
EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND THERE WAS 
STILL ENGLAND FANS WHO HAD TICKETS

WITH YOUR TROUBLES WILL NOT BE OVER 
I'D LIKE TO GO TO MOSCOW 
THIS TAXI 
WANTED SIXTY TO GO THE TWENTY MILES TO

BE HOTELS 
IF YOU'RE VERY LUCKY YOU MIGHT GET 
A ROOM AT THIS SOVIET ERA MONSTER 
FOR ONE HUNDRED NIGHT OTHERS ARE ASKING 
UP TO FIVE HUNDRED FIND THG HOTEL 
SHOULDN'T BE PROBLEM BUT WHAT

STADIUM WHEN YOU DO FINALLY MAKE 
IT HERE THE ONE THING YOU MUSTN'T 
FORGET TO BRING WITH YOU IS THIS 
YOUR PASSPORT YOU CAN BE FINED FOR 
NOT CARRYING ONE IN MOSCOW BUT IT 
IS MUCH MORE LIKELY THE POLICE WILL 
INSTEAD DEMAND NICE FAT BRIBE 
BUT DON'T WORRY AT LEAST MOSCOW
