NERVOUS WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE THE BRIEF TO BE

WHAT DON'T YOU WANT THE BRIEF TO BE 
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE TO DO WITH STYLE I'VE GOT NO SENSE OF STYLE 
ARE YOU READY TO RECEIVE YOUR BRIEF YEAH 
DON'T GET IN A FLAP THIS IS ONE ADVENTUROUS CHALLENGE 
YOUR TEAM HAS TO COME UP WITH A NEW PRODUCT FOR THE GREAT OUTDOORS 
IT MUST BE LARGE ENOUGH TO HOUSE THREE OF YOUR MATES 
AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN 
WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD GREAT OUTDOORS WHAT COMES TO MIND 
OPEN FIELDS FORESTS 
MAYBE A TENT SLEEPING BAGS 
HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT YOU'LL WIN 
ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT YEAH YEAH 
I'M TERRIFIED TO BE QUITE HONEST I'M NOT AN OUTDOORS GIRL AT ALL 
I KNOW THAT WE'LL PULL TOGETHER AND WIN 
THE OUTDOOR LEISURE INDUSTRY IS WORTH A WHOPPING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR 
WITH NINETY MILLION SPENT ON TENTS SO WILL OUR TWO TEAMS BE ABLE TO 
FIND AN OPENING IN THIS COMPETITIVE MARKET 
I'VE SENT BOTH TEAMS OFF TO DO THEIR MARKET RESEARCH 
THEY NEED TO WORK AS A TEAM TO RISE TO THIS CHALLENGE 
THEY HEAD STRAIGHT FOR THE SHOPS TO GET IDEAS FOR THEIR PRODUCTS 
KIDS LOVE COLOUR BRIGHT THINGS 
IN TERMS OF SHAPE THE BIGGER THE BETTER THAT BIG ONE 
IT HAS TO BE THE BIGGEST THING WE CAN COME UP WITH 
I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE WHAT EXISTS ALREADY 
OUTDOOR SHOPS ARE MY IDEA OF SHOPPING HELL 
LET'S GET IN YEAH TRY IT OUT 
I'VE BEEN CAMPING AS A KID AND WITH FRIENDS 
I REALLY DO HAVE A GOOD IDEA AS TO WHAT THE MARKET IS 
YOU COULD HAVE A SEATING AREA THAT SIDE'S A SCREEN 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MINI KIDS' WORLD 
LIKE A HOUSE THEY CAN DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN'T DO AT HOME 
SOMETHING THAT'S THEMED ON THE WHOLE DESIGN IF IT'S A SPACE SHIP POD 
THERE CAN BE MARTIANS THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA ASTRONAUTS PERHAPS 
I'M GONE SENDING TO OUTER SPACE 
SPACESHIP DRINKS SPACESHIP YEAH SPACE DRINKS SPACE COLA 
GOING FOR A SPACE THEME 
WHILE THE BIG SHOTS ARE ON ANOTHER PLANET 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE CLOSER TO HOME 
YOU COULD FIT SOME COMPARTMENTS 
YOU COULD HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT TUNNELS ONE OF THEM'S A DOOR 
AND THREE ROOMS AND A MIDDLE BIT 
OUR BIGGEST STRENGTH IS THAT WE'RE KIDS MAKING SOMETHING FOR KIDS 
SO WE'RE RIGHT ON TARGET 
YOU WANT SOMETHING COMFY COS YOU CAN'T SLEEP ON ANYTHING HARD 
INFLATABLE GOOD IDEA INFLATABLE IT'S REALLY SOFT ISN'T IT 
IT'LL BE EASY TO PACK AWAY AS WELL 
OUR BIGGEST STRENGTH IS THAT WE'RE BEING REALLY IMAGINATIVE AND CLEVER 
WE'RE BEING STRONG AS A TEAM 
THE BIG SHOTS NEED TO TRY OUT THEIR IDEAS WITH SOME SCOUTS 
IF WE PRESENTED TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT TENT BASED THEMES 
ONE BEING A NIGHTCLUB TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT 
HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE THAT TO A SPACESHIP TYPE TENT 
WOULD THAT WORK FOR YOU 
NO TOLD YOU 
I THINK THE SPACESHIP IDEA IS REALLY RIDICULOUS 
BECAUSE YOU REALLY WOULDN'T WANT A TENT IN A SPACESHIP SHAPE 
WHAT WOULD YOU DO INSIDE IT 
OH WOW WOW THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE ISN'T THERE IT'S GOOD 
SO YOU GET DRESSED IN THERE AND SLEEP IN THERE YEAH 
AND KEEP MUDDY THINGS HERE YEAH 
THEY THOUGHT OF V. I. P. NIGHTCLUBS 
THAT COULD FIT WELL WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT IDEA IT'S AMAZING 
THAT COULD BE THE V. I. P. SECTION ABSOLUTELY 
BUT WE CAN'T STAY UP LATE AND LISTENING TO MUSIC WELL 
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE QUIET THINK OF THE SURROUNDINGS 
AND THE WEATHER I DON'T THINK THEIR NIGHTCLUB IDEA WOULD WORK 
TO HELP THE BRIGHT SPARKS WITH THEIR IDEAS 
THEY TALKED TO CANDY FROM THE CAMPING AND CARAVANNING CLUB 
THINK ABOUT WHETHER YOU'D BE LIVING IN IT 
AS WELL AS SLEEPING IN IT 
IF YOU'RE JUST SLEEPING IN IT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU CAN'T STAND 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO SPEND TIME IN IT YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE TWO SECTIONS 
WHERE YOU HAVE ONE BIT TO SLEEP IN LIKE THIS 
WITH ONE SLEEPING PART AND A BIG FENCE PART 
BOTH TEAMS HAVE GOT STUCK INTO THEIR MARKET RESEARCH 
BUT HAVE THEY DONE ENOUGH TO COME UP WITH THE PERFECT HOME FROM HOME 
IT'S TIME FOR THE BRAINSTORM 
ANYTHING WE CREATE WE HAVE TO HAVE FUN IN MIND 
WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM MARKET RESEARCH 
P. V. C. FOR THE WINDOWS YEAH 
WE WANT IT INFLATABLE SO IT'S COMFY YEAH 
WHAT PATTERN DO WE WANT SMILEY FACES THAT'S A GOOD ONE 
ARE YOU DOING A CIRCLE OR A TRIANGLE A TRIANGLE 
WITH THE BRIGHT SPARKS MOVING AHEAD THE BIG SHOTS CAN'T DECIDE 
WE NEED TO AGREE WHAT WE'RE DESIGNING HERE WHAT IS IT 
WE'VE TOO MANY THINGS IS IT A POOL TENT 
IF WE'RE NOT DESIGNING THAT WHAT ARE WE DOING 
WE'RE DESIGNING A CASTLE SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE THAT 
IT'S NOT PRACTICAL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT 
EXACTLY 
WE'RE DESIGNING A TENT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT 
RIGHT ARE WE AGREEING THAT WE'RE DESIGNING A TENT NO 
I THINK IT'S REALLY GIRLIE 
WITH THE BIG SHOTS IDEAS ALL OVER THE PLACE 
THEY'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO IF THEY'RE GOING TO CATCH UP 
WE STILL NEED TO THINK OF A NAME 
IT'S INFLATABLE AND THERE'S A SMILE INFLATE A SMILE 
INFLATE A SMILE THAT SOUNDS ACE 
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S NOT BEEN THE NAME OF ANYTHING ELSE 
IF IT IS WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE IT 
O. K. BRIGHT SPARKS WHAT HAVE YOU COME UP WITH 
WHAT WE'VE GOT IS A TRIANGLE WITH A SMILEY FACE ALONG THE TOP 
AND THEN THERE'S LIKE ALMOST A CORRIDOR GOING TO EACH ONE 
WE'VE GOT ONE IN THE CENTRE WHICH WE CAN USE FOR STORAGE 
ON PAPER IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE REALLY BUSY 
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU'RE WORKING AS A TEAM 
YOU'RE DRAWING BIG SMILEY FACES HERE 
YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF DESIGNS DOWN 
NEXT TIME I COME IN I'D LIKE YOU 
TO PRESENT YOUR IDEA TO ME AS ONE TEAM ON ONE PIECE OF PAPER 
WHEN SAIRA GAVE US BAD COMMENTS 
IT WAS QUITE INTIMIDATING AND YOU JUST THOUGHT OH NO 
AND WE CALL IT DREAM CASTLE NO YES 
GIRLIE WHY IS IT GIRLIE 
IT IS DREAM CASTLE 
O. K. BUT YOU'RE THE ONE TALKING ABOUT PINK 
GUYS HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SHOW ME 
WE'VE GOT A DREAM CASTLE 
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM HAVEN'T YOU IN THIS TEAM 
I DON'T THINK WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT 
YOU HAVE GOT ALL THE ANSWERS FROM YOUR MARKET RESEARCH 
AND WHAT I THINK YOU'RE FINDING DIFFICULT 
IS YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT THE CHILDREN'S MARKET 
THE BIG SHOTS ARE JUST SCRAMBLING IN THE DARK 
THEY NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY LEARNT FROM THEIR MARKET RESEARCH 
WE EACH GAVE IT OUR BEST SHOT BUT WE WEREN'T WORKING AS A TEAM AT ALL 
FINALLY THE BIG SHOTS ARE ABOUT TO HAVE AN IDEA THEY ALL LIKE 
WHAT'S THE ANIMAL WITH LOADS OF LEGS AN OCTOPUS A CATERPILLAR 
CAN YOU DRAW AN OCTOPUS 
I COULD DO MY BEST 
AND THEN THESE COULD BE 
THE POD CHAMBERS THESE COULD BE USED FOR STORAGE 
COS THEY WANTED SOMEWHERE TO PUT DIRTY CLOTHES 
ANNA SELL IT TO ME 
OUR PRODUCT IS CALLED HAPPY CAMPERS 
WE HAVE THREE SEPARATE ROOMS FOR SLEEPING IN 
WE HAVE A CENTREPIECE WHICH IS THE LIVING SPACE 
TO MAKE IT LUXURIOUS WE'VE GOT INFLATABLE SOFAS AROUND THE EDGES 
THERE ARE STARGAZING WINDOWS 
WHICH COME FROM THE EYES WHICH IS CLEAR PLASTIC 
I HAVE TO SAY I THINK YOU'VE DONE AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT JOB 
I REALLY LIKE YOUR DESIGN YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF IDEAS 
IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LUXURIOUS AND MY FAVOURITE BIT IS THE STARGAZING 
I THINK WE'VE DEFINITELY GOT A WINNING IDEA 
BECAUSE OF THE INFLATABLE CHAIRS AND ESPECIALLY THE NIGHT GAZING WINDOWS 
TRICIA CAN YOU PLEASE PITCH YOUR PRODUCT TO ME 
WE'VE COME UP WITH SOMETHING CALLED THE OCTOPAD 
MM THERE'S GOING TO BE TWO CHAMBERS 
A STRUCTURE WITHIN A STRUCTURE MM H. M. M. 
THE MIDDLE STRUCTURE IS WHERE THEY SLEEP 
ON THE OUTSIDE THEY'VE GOT DIFFERENT ZONES 
AND THE PODS ARE GOING TO BE QUITE PRACTICAL 
THE TENTACLES THEY ASKED FOR SOMEWHERE TO STORE THEIR STUFF 
I ACTUALLY THINK YOU'VE COME UP WITH A VERY GOOD IDEA 
THE NEXT STAGE OF THIS IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PRESENT YOUR IDEA 
TO A LEADING CAMPING RETAILER 
THAT'S HUGE THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS PRODUCT FOR YOU 
WE'LL BEAT THESE BIG SHOTS WE KNOW WE CAN DO IT 
I THINK THE BRIGHT SPARKS REALLY NEED TO RUN FOR THE HILLS 
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BEAT THE PANTS OFF THEM 
IN PREPARATION FOR THE PITCHES 
BOTH TEAMS HAVE WORKED UP THEIR DESIGNS 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS HAVE A LAPTOP PITCH AND MODEL 
WHILE THE BIG SHOTS HAVE REFINED THEIR DRAWINGS 
BY ADDING ACCESSORIES AND ILLUSTRATIONS 
BUT ONLY ONE TEAM CAN WIN THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY 
SO THE PRESSURE'S ON AS BOTH TEAMS MEET AT MILLETS 
THE U. K.'S LEADING CAMPING RETAILER 
WHERE THEY'LL PITCH THEIR IDEAS TO ALI ROSE 
THE BIG SHOTS BETTER BE SCARED 
I'M EXCITED ABOUT MEETING THE BRIGHT SPARKS 
IT'LL BE REALLY GOOD TO SET EYES ON OUR COMPETITION 
OH THE KIDS THE KIDDIES ARE HERE HOW ARE YOU DOING 
ARE YOU GUYS PREPARED TO LOSE REALLY WE COME FROM WINSVILLE 
WINSVILLE WHERE ARE THE SUITS WE'RE NOT BORING 
YOU'RE IN BUSINESS YOU NEED TO PREPARE BORING 
THEY'RE KIDS THEY TURN UP WEARING CLOTHES YOU COULD GO TO THE PARK IN 
ALI TOSSES A COIN TO DECIDE WHICH TEAM PITCHES FIRST 
SORRY GUYS IT'S HEADS FOLLOW ME O. K. OFF YOU GO 
TO THE SLAUGHTER IT'S THE TAKING PART THAT COUNTS YOU KNOW 
YEAH YEAH YOU'RE GONNA LOSE WITH THAT 
THEY'RE SHORT THEY'RE VERY YOUNG 
VERY NAIVE AND I THINK WE'VE GOT THE UPPER HAND 
WE'VE NAMED IT HAPPY CAMPERS 
MM H. M. M. THIS IS A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF OUR DESIGN 
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE HERE AND HERE ARE BEDROOMS 
THESE ARE TUNNELS AND THIS IS THE DOOR 
THESE ARE THE POSITIVES 
AN INFLATABLE FUN TENT THAT IS EASY TO PUT UP NO ADULTS REQUIRED 
HAVE A LOOK YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
IT'S AN INFLATABLE TENT WITH INFLATABLE PARTS 
SUCH AS CHAIRS AND A LIVING AREA WE'VE GOT P. V. C. STARGAZING EYES 
THAT YOU CAN PEEL BACK AND LOOK AT THE STARS AT NIGHT 
THANK YOU AND HAPPY CAMPING WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I THINK IT LOOKS VERY FUN 
MY FIRST CONCERN IS THAT THIS WOULD MAKE THIS A HUGE CONSTRUCTION 
MY SECOND POINT IS THE INFLATABILITY OF IT 
BECAUSE IF THESE ARE GOING TO BE BIG ENOUGH TO STAND UP 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE QUITE BIG TUBES TO INFLATE WITH AIR 
TO ACTUALLY HOLD ALL OF THESE STRUCTURES UP 
WHICH IS GOING TO MEAN A LOT OF PUMPING TALK TO ME ABOUT THE NAME 
WE WERE THINKING OF CALLING IT HAPPY CAMPERS WITH THE SMILEY FACE APPEAL 
WELL THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THAT COS SOMEBODY ALREADY OWNS THAT NAME 
ALI'S CHANGED A COUPLE OF THINGS BUT 
WE THINK IT'S FOR THE BETTER COS SHE'S THE EXPERT 
OOH HERE THEY COME 
HOW ARE YOU DOING LOSERS DID YOU MANAGE TO SWITCH THE LAPTOP ON 
NO I FORGOT WAS IT GOOD FUN YEAH 
YOU GUYS LOOK DEFEATED 
I'M PLEASED HOW IT WENT BUT 
I'M A BIT NERVOUS ABOUT THE BIG SHOT'S IDEAS 
SHOULD WE STOP THEM PEEPING IN THE OFFICE OH YEAH 
LET'S STOP THEM O. K. 
AMIN'S IN FRONT OF THE KEYHOLE SO WE CAN'T SEE 
IT'S A TENT BASED ON AN OCTOPUS 
SHALL WE SEE IF WE CAN LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW YEAH COME ON 
LOOKING DOWN FROM THE TOP THERE'S TWO SECTIONS TO THE TENT 
THERE'S THE SLEEPING PAD WHICH IS THE INNER TENT 
AND THEN THERE'S THE ACTIVITY PAD WHICH IS SPLIT INTO FOUR AREAS 
THEY'VE GOT TWO BIG TENTACLES HERE WHERE THEY CAN PUT BOOTS AND SHOES 
IDEALLY WE'D LIKE TO HAVE SPEAKERS WITHIN THE TENT IS THAT POSSIBLE 
SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD PLUG AN M. P. THREE PLAYER INTO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THEY'RE SPYING ON US THEY CAN'T SEE IT 
IT'S A CRABBY FISHY SHARKY THING 
IT'S QUITE BORING 
THE BIG SHOTS HAVE COME UP WITH LIKE A SHARK THING 
YOU WALK INTO ITS MOUTH AND IT EATS YOU 
I MEAN OURS HAS GOT SMILEY FACES AND TUNNELS AND DIFFERENT COMPARTMENTS 
AND THEIRS IS JUST A SHARK THAT EATS YOU 
IT'S RIDICULOUS AND THEY CALL THEMSELVES PROFESSIONALS 
I LIKE THE DIFFERENT COMPARTMENTS AND THE WELCOME AREA 
WHERE YOU CAN DE DIRT YOURSELF THE DIFFERENT ZONES ARE GREAT 
I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE SCALE OF THIS YEAH 
SO THERE'S LOADS OF POSITIVES IN THERE BUT MY MAIN CONCERN 
IS ACTUALLY ACHIEVING THE VISUAL IMPACT OF AN OCTOPUS 
AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE PROBABLY IN THE LEAD 
THAT'S COS THEY'VE THOUGHT OF IT FROM A KID'S POINT OF VIEW 
BUT THEY'VE REALLY GOT THE FUN ELEMENT IN THERE 
WITH THE PITCHES WRAPPED UP IT'S TIME TO MAKE THEIR IDEAS REALITY 
THE BIG SHOTS GO TO WORK ON THEIR TENT'S FABRIC 
AND THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE WORKING WITH DESIGNER DAVID 
THERE ARE A FEW PROBLEMS WITH THIS DESIGN MM H. M. M. 
IT'S TOO FLAT AND BOXY YEAH 
AND THAT AFFECTS THE WIND AND THE RAIN 
I WOULD SUGGEST 
THAT WE USE POP UP TENTS IN THE CORNERS 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO THINK OF A NAME AREN'T WE I LIKE THE POD 
THE SMILEY PODS THE SMILEY PODS 
THE SMILEY PODS O. K. YOU COULD HAVE IT WITH A Z. 
YEAH WITH A Z. YEAH 
SMILEY PODZ WITH A Z. 
MEANWHILE THE BIG SHOTS ARE WORKING WITH HANNAH ON THE TENT'S FABRIC 
YOU'D HAVE A SLEEPING MAT THAT COULD BE VELCRO AS WE DISCUSSED 
BUT ALSO YOU COULD USE IT OUTSIDE SOUNDS GOOD 
WITH BOTH TENTS TAKING SHAPE THE TEAMS SWAP DESIGNERS 
ARE YOU KEEN ON KEEPING THE OUTER 
YES THAT'S ACCEPTABLE WHAT WOULD BE NICE IS 
A TRANSPARENT POCKET THAT YOU CAN SLIDE IN THE SIZE OF A D. V. D. PLAYER 
CONDENSATION WILL RUN DOWN AND GET INTO THAT 
IF IT'S RAINING OUTSIDE AND TOUCHING THE FABRIC ON THE INSIDE 
IT'LL JUST LET WATER IN CAN WE NOT ADD AN ADDITIONAL PLASTIC MEMBRANE 
TO THE BACK OF THIS AREA THAT'S CONDENSATION PROOF 
A PLASTIC MEMBRANE WON'T BREATHE WILL IT 
WOULD IT NEED TO CONDENSATION BUILDS COS THE WATER CAN'T ESCAPE 
COME ON ARE YOU SAYING PEOPLE CAN'T WATCH A D. V. D. IN THE TENT 
LET'S SEE WHAT THE EXPERT SAYS 
HE'S SAYING THAT YOU WOULDN'T PUT ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS NEXT TO WATER 
IF YOU CAN LISTEN TO A RADIO YOU'D ELECTROCUTE THE CHILDREN 
THE BOYS DON'T LISTEN THAT'S BEEN PROBLEMATIC TODAY 
THEY REALLY NEEDED TO LISTEN TO THE ADVICE THEY WERE BEING GIVEN 
THEY WEREN'T AND THAT WAS QUITE CHALLENGING 
I'VE BROUGHT SOME MATS THAT WE USE BUT IT'S MUCH HAPPIER 
IN THE BRIGHT SPARKS' CAMP AS THEY CHOSE THEIR FLOORING MATERIAL 
WE ALSO USE A MAT THAT INFLATES ITSELF 
WOW SO SHALL WE UNROLL THIS 
IF YOU UNDO THE VALVE AND LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY 
IT'S INFLATING ITSELF 
I THINK WE'VE STILL GOT A BETTER IDEA THAN THE BIG SHOTS 
BRIGHT SPARKS IT'S THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE GONNA WIN 
AT THIS POINT I'M TIPPING THE BRIGHT SPARKS TO WIN 
THEY'VE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT AND TIME INTO THEIR DESIGN 
KIDS WILL LOVE IT AND IT'S JUST A GREAT IDEA 
BUT IT'S NOT UP TO HANNAH THAT'S THE JOB OF OUR TWENTY FIVE EXPERT JUDGES 
THE PRODUCTS HAVE NOW BEEN MADE 
SO IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHO HAS WON THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY 
IT'S DECISION DAY 
BOTH OUR TEAMS HAVE PITCHED UP AT THE BEAT THE BOSS H. Q. 
TO GET THE RESULT 
I DO THINK WE'VE GOT A WINNING PRODUCT AND THAT WE SHOULD WIN 
THE ADULTS HAVE BEEN REALLY COCKY SAYING WE'RE GONNA WIN 
I'D LOVE TO SEE THE LOOK ON THEIR FACES IF AND WHEN WE DO WIN 
I'M EXCITED ABOUT SEEING THE PRODUCT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
I'VE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE I'M QUITE APPREHENSIVE 
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT WE'VE WON BUT I'M STILL NERVOUS 
WE CAN STILL BEAT THE BRIGHT SPARKS YEAH 
MY MESSAGE TO THE BIG SHOTS IS

DO YOU THINK CHILDREN WOULD LIKE THIS CHILDREN OUR AGE YEAH

WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT THEY'VE GOT 
ARE YOU READY TO SEE YOUR PRODUCT YES

IT'S GOT THE TUNNELS AND THE TEPEE IN THE MIDDLE 
YOU'VE SEEN THE PHOTOS ARE YOU READY TO SEE THE REAL THING YES 
FOLLOW ME 
HERE IS OCTOPAD WOW IT'S UNBELIEVABLE IT'S MASSIVE 
I'M GOING TO OPEN IT UP LET'S GET INSIDE 
WHAT YOU WANTED WAS FOUR DIFFERENT ZONES YEP 
YOU WANTED RECIPE CARDS YOU WANTED PLACES FOR YOUR DIRTY SHOES YEP 
AND THEN YOU WANTED STORAGE ALL THE WAY ROUND THAT'S IT 
LET'S RELEASE THE SLEEPING QUARTERS 
WOW WOW 
THERE YOU GO THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
O. K. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
THE BRIEF SAID IT HAD TO BE LUXURIOUS COMFORTABLE 
AND HAVE A UNIQUE DESIGN DO YOU THINK YOU MET IT DEFINITELY 
VERY PLEASED ABSOLUTELY LOOK AT IT WE'VE GOT THE WINNING PRODUCT 
SHALL WE GO INSIDE YEAH 
DUDE WOAH 
WOW

IT'S TONS BETTER THAN ANYTHING WE COULD HAVE EXPECTED YEAH 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THE FLOORING YEAH IT'S THE MATERIAL WE WANTED 
IT'S REALLY COMFY AND YOU CAN'T FEEL THE ROUGH GROUND UNDERNEATH 
ANNA THE SLEEPING POD IS RIGHT THROUGH THERE 
DO YOU WANT TO GO DOWN AND LOOK 
WOW 
THIS IS BIG 
THEY'VE EVEN GOT THE EYES LIKE WE SAID SO YOU CAN STAR GAZE 
AND SPACIOUS 
I LOVE THE COLOURS AS WELL IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED 
O. K. LET'S SEE WHAT THE BIG SHOTS MAKE OF YOUR TENT 
IT'S ADVENTUROUS A BIT OF FUN BUT DOESN'T COMPETE WITH OURS 
THEY'RE NOT VERY EXCITED WELL THEY'RE ADULTS 
THEY'RE DULL AND BORING THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S FUN 
WHEN IT COMES TO ADULTS THEY KNOW NOTHING 
THEY THINK AN OCTOPUS IS FUN 
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK OF YOUR PRODUCTS 
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS WHAT DID YOUR TARGET MARKET THINK 
IF WE GO BACK UP TO THE BOARD ROOM WE'LL FIND OUT 
TO MAKE IT FAIR OUR TWENTY FIVE EXPERT JUDGES 
DON'T KNOW WHO'S MADE WHICH TENT 
FIRST UP THE BIG SHOTS' OCTOPAD 
WICKED IT'S PRETTY GOOD FOR PUTTING ALL YOUR STUFF IN IN THE DAYTIME 
SO YOU CAN HAVE MORE SPACE 
I DON'T THINK THE EYES AT THE TOP ARE VERY GOOD 
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE OUT THEY'RE QUITE HIGH UP 
IT WAS GOOD THERE WAS A PLACE TO EAT A PLACE TO CHILL PLAY GAMES 
I DON'T THINK THAT THE SLEEPING AREA'S VERY GOOD 
BECAUSE IF IT'S JUST CHILDREN 
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET THE SLEEPING AREA DOWN 
YEAH OCTOPAD IS A LUXURIOUS TENT 
BECAUSE IT'S GOT ANOTHER ROOM IN 
AND THE TENT'S ALSO QUITE BIG TO PUT ALL YOUR THINGS IN 
THERE WASN'T ANYTHING I LIKED 
ALL THE COMPARTMENTS WERE SMALL AND CRAMPED 
AND THERE WASN'T MUCH ROOM TO DO ANYTHING IN THERE 
NEXT IT'S THE BRIGHT SPARKS' SMILEY PODZ 
I THINK IT'S QUITE A GOOD NAME SMILEY PODZ 
IF THERE WAS ONE BAD THING IT'S A BIT BIG 
IT'S A BIT LIKE THE TARDIS ACTUALLY 
COS WHEN YOU LOOK ON THE OUTSIDE IT LOOKS QUITE SMALL 
BUT WHEN YOU GO INSIDE IT'S REALLY BIG 
I LIKE THE WINDOWS BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THE STARS AT NIGHT TIME 
I THINK THE INSIDE OF THE TENT IS A BIT CROWDED 
BECAUSE THERE'S A POLE IN THE MIDDLE 
AND IT'S HARD TO GO ALL AROUND IT WITH THE POLE IN THE MIDDLE 
I THINK OVERALL THOUGH THIS TENT'S REALLY REALLY GOOD 
YOU CAN PLAY HIDE AND SEEK THE WORST BIT IS PROBABLY THE COLOURS 
I THINK THAT THE CHILDREN MADE THE OCTOPAD ONE 
AND THE ADULTS MADE THE OTHER SMILEY PODZ 
BRIGHT SPARKS OUR JUDGES REALLY LIKED THE STAR GAZING EYES 
BUT THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE POLE IN THE MIDDLE 
AND BIG SHOTS OUR JUDGES THOUGHT YOUR STORAGE AREA WAS FANTASTIC 
BUT THEY DIDN'T LIKE THAT 
THEY COULDN'T BRING THE SLEEPING AREA DOWN VERY EASILY 
BUT WHO DID THEY VOTE AS THE OVERALL WINNER 
OF THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY 
I HAVE THE RESULT RIGHT HERE IN MY HAND 
THE WINNERS OF THE BEAT THE BOSS TENT PRODUCT
