HELLO WELCOME TO THE DAILY 
POLITICS A BELEAGUERED PRIME 
MINISTER CONTINUES HIS FIGHTBACK 
TODAY BUT NOBODY KNOWS IF IT IS 
HAVING ANY POSITIVE IMPACT GORDON 
BROWN HAS BEEN TRYING TO THIS MORNING AND 
HE IS STILL TALKING AS WE GO ON 
AIR MR. BROWN IS ABOUT TO GO HEAD 
TO HEAD THE PRESS IN HIS 
MONTHLY DOWNING STREET PRESS 
CONFERENCE ALSO THIS MORNING 
SHOCKING NEW STATISTICS REVEAL A 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT INCREASE IN CRIMES COMMITTED BY 
YOUNG GIRLS WE'LL HEAR WHAT 
HAPPENED WHEN ONE OF THIRTEEN YEAR OLD 
REFUSED TO TAKE PART IN AL WEST 
LONDON GANG'S INITIATION CEREMONY 
AND WE HAVE GOT AN ALL STAR CAST 
HERE THIS MORNING BORIS JOHNSON 
THE NEWLY ELECTED MAYOR OF LONDON 
WILL BE DROPPING IN TO TELL US HOW 
HE INTENDS TO TAKE BACK THE STREETS 
FROM THE THUGS AND HOW HE INTENDS 
TO ENSURE THE FUTURE FINANCIAL 
STABILITY OF CITY OF LONDON 
ALL OF THAT COMING UP IN AN ACTION 
PACKED THIRTY MINUTES HERE WITH US FOR 
THE DURATION THE HIGHER EDUCATION 
MINISTER LET'S FIRST OF ALL GO 
BACK TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND 
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE TAKING PLACE 
IN DOWNING STREET L. THINK WE HAVE 
GOT SOME PICTURES COMING UP HE IS 
EVERYWHERE IN THE MEDIA THIS 
MORNING IT IS LIKE A LONDON BUS 
YOU DON'T SEE HIM FOR DAYS AND 
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE ARE 
THREE OF THEM HIS SPIN DOCTORS 
SEEMED TO THINK THAT THE MORE WE 
SEE OF HIM AND THE MORE HE EXPLAINS 
THINGS 
THE MORE POPULAR HE COULD 
GOOD I THINK THERE IS NO QUICK FIX 
TO THE CURRENT SITUATION ANYONE 
WHO THINKS WE CAN CERTAINLY MAKE 
ONE OR TWO MOVES TO TRANSFORM OUR 
POLITICAL MISFORTUNES FORTUNES IS 
MISLEADING THEMSELVES WHAT WE 
THING TO DO IS TO SOLIDLY GOVERN I 
THINK THE PROGRAMME THAT GORDON SET 
OUT YESTERDAY REGARDING HOUSING 
PLUS OUR RADICAL COMMITMENT TO 
ALLOW PEOPLE TO REQUEST THE RIGHT 
TO TRAINING THESE ARE BIG STEPS 
FORWARD WE NEED TO SET OURSELVES 
UP FOR A LONG HAUL TOWARDS THE NEXT 
GENERAL ELECTION L. THINK THAT AS 
WE MOVE FORWARD THE CONTRAST 
BETWEEN GORDON BROWN HAS A SOLID 
DEPENDABLE SERIOUS POLITICIAN 
AGAINST WHAT I THINK PEOPLE AND I 
GOT THIS ON THE DOORSTEP YESTERDAY 
IN CREWE EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE 
CONCERNS ABOUT US THE P. R. D. VICTORY 
OF DAVID CAMERON 
THE P. R. 
GIMMICKRY OF DAVID CAMERON BUT 
THAT BORE NO RELATION AT ALL TO THE 
QUESTION I ASKED YOU LET ME ASK 
YOU ANOTHER ONE AFTER THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS WHICH WERE DIRE FOR YOUR 
PARTY GORDON BROWN TOURED THE T. V. 
AND RADIO STUDIOS IN A CHARM 
OFFENSIVE AND WITHIN FIVE DAYS 
THE OPINION POLLS HAD SLUMPED EVEN 
WORSE EVEN WORSE TO THE WORST 
SINCE RECORDS BEGAN SO WHAT MAKES 
YOU THINK THAT THIS TIME IT WILL 
GET BETTER 
I THINK GORDON IS THE 
BEST LEADER THAT WE CAN PUT FORWARD 
WHY DON'T THE PEOPLE 
HOLD ON IF 
WE GO BACK TO SEPTEMBER THE PRESS 
PERCEPTION WAS THAT GORDON WALKED 
ON WATER WE ARE NOW IN A MORE 
DIFFICULT SITUATION WHAT I THINK 
GORDON NEEDS TO DO WHICH IS WHAT 
HE IS DOING IS BE STRAIGHT WITH 
PEOPLE AND PLAY TO HIS VIRTUES 
WHICH IS SERIOUSLY GOVERNING IN 
DIFFICULT 
THE PROBLEM IS HE IS DIFFICULT NOT STRAIGHT WITH PEOPLE AND THAT 
IS WHAT PEOPLE HAVE RUMBLED HE 
WOULD NOT TELL US THE TRUTH ABOUT 
WHY HE DIDN'T CALL THE ELECTION IT 
WAS CLEARLY BECAUSE THE POLLS 
SUGGESTED HE WOULD NOT WIN IT BUT 
HE WOULD NEVER TELL US THAT THE 
REASON WHY ALMOST THREE BILLION IS 
BEING PUMPED INTO THE ECONOMY NOW 
IS NOT BECAUSE THE SITUATION HAS 
DETERIORATED SINCE THE BUDGET IT'S 
EXACTLY THE SAME IT'S BECAUSE HE 
HAD TO SPEND THREE BILLION TO REPAIR 
THE TEN P. NONSENSE THIS MORNING HE 
WOULDN'T ADMIT THAT EITHER HE IS 
SAYING THIS IS A KIND OF PUMP 
PRIMING EXERCISE WHY DIDN'T HE DO 
IT IN THE BUDGET HE IS NOT HONEST 
WITH US 
A I THINK HE IS STRAIGHT 
WITH PEOPLE AND THAT WILL BECOME 
CLEARER AS TIME GOES ON I THINK 
FIRST OFF HE ACKNOWLEDGED CLEARLY 
THAT THE TEN P. DECISION WAS A MISTAKE 
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HE HAS 
BROUGHT FORWARD CHANGES TO PUT A 
SITUATION RIGHT WHAT IS MOST 
FRUSTRATING ABOUT THIS SITUATION 
THIS LABOUR GOVERNMENT HAS DONE 
MORE THAN ANY PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT 
TO BOOST THE INCOMES OF POOR 
WORKING PEOPLE THAT'S WHY TEN P. MAN 
WAS A MISTAKE WE ARE PUTTING THAT 
RIGHT AND INTO THE BARGAIN WE ARE 
NOT JUST SUPPORTING THOSE PEOPLE 
WHO WERE AFFECTED BUT IT IS A 
WIDER TAX CUT 
WHY DIDN'T HE DO 
THAT IN THE BUDGET 
HE HAS 
ACKNOWLEDGED IT WAS A MISTAKE WE WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME ALREADY SO 
WE'LL MOVE ON WE'VE GOT THIRTY MINUTES 
WE'LL COME BACK TO CARRY ON OUR 
THEME OF MONTHLY PRESS CONFERENCES 
AS THE PRIME MINISTER IS ANSWERING 
QUESTIONS IT IS TIME FOR OUR DAILY 
QUIZ THE QUESTION FOR TODAY IS ALL 
ABOUT THAT MONTHLY PRESS CONFERENCE 
THE QUESTION IS THIS 
A TRICKY QUESTION THIS TO ENTER 
GO TO OUR WEBSITE 
PLEASE SEND US YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT 
ANY OF TODAY'S STORIES 
IT IS ONLY TRICKY IF YOU ARE 
BOTHERED JO IS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW 
SHE DOES GET BOTHERED ABOUT THESE 
THINGS NOW THEN I THINK WE'RE 
GOING TO TURN TO CRIME NOW 
BECAUSE LET ME JUST GET MY 
SCRIPT HERE THE HOME SECRETARY 
JACK SMITH HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THIS 
MORNING THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
CRIMES INVOLVING THOSE UNDER SIXTEEN 
WILL BE RECORDED A LOT OF YOU MAY 
NOT KNOW THAT IN THE BRITISH CRIME 
SURVEY UNTIL NOW CRIMES COMMITTED 
BY UNDER SIXTEENS ARE NOT RECORDED AND 
YET YOUTH CRIME NOW REGULARLY 
DOMINATES THE HEADLINES YOU HAVE 
SEEN THEM IN ALL MAJOR CITIES 
ACROSS THE LAND THERE HAVE BEEN 
TERRIBLE STORIES SUCH AS LAST WEEK 
WHEN YOUNG JIMMY MIZEN SIMPLY BY 
GOING TO A BAKER'S SHOP BECAME THE 
THIRTEENTH TEENAGER MURDERED IN THE 
CAPITAL THIS YEAR SO FAR IN OTHER 
HIGH PROFILE CASES THERE IS A 
WORRYING NEW TREND OF WHAT THE 
TABLOIDS ARE CALLING LADETTE 
CULTURE THERE ARE REPORTS OF GIRLS 
JOINING GANGS AND COMMITTING CRIMES 
THE NEW FIGURES ON YOUTH CRIME ARE 
OUT TODAY 
LAST WEEK THE HOME SECRETARY 
FAILED TO TURN THE TABLES ON YOUNG 
TROUBLEMAKERS BY ORDERING POLICE 
OFFICERS TO GIVE THEM A TASTE OF 
THEIR OWN MEDICINE AND SUBJECT 
THEM TO REPEATED VISITS NEW 
FIGURES PUBLISHED TODAY FROM THE 
YOUTH JUSTICE BOARD REVEAL THAT IT 
IS NOT JUST YOUNG MEN WHO ARE 
BEHAVING BADLY THE NUMBER OF 
OFFENCES COMMITTED BY GIRLS AGED 
BETWEEN TEN AND SEVENTEEN IS UP BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OVER 
A THREE YEAR PERIOD THE CRIMES 
RECORDED INCLUDE PUBLIC ORDER 
OFFENCES AND VIOLENCE THERE WERE 
OFTEN CARRIED OUT BY GIRLS WHO ARE 
DRUNK OVERALL WHILE MOST YOUTH 
OFFENCES ARE CARRIED OUT BY BOYS 
THE STATISTICS FOR TEN TO SEVENTEEN YEAR 
OLD BOYS SHOW A SLIGHT REDUCTION 
FOR THE SAME PERIOD BORIS JOHNSON 
IS PROMISING ZERO TOLERANCE ON 
YOUTH CRIME WE ARE NOW JOINED BY 
COUNCILLOR MARIANNE ALAPANI WHO 
CAMPAIGNS ON BEHALF OF VICTIMS OF 
SUCH CRIMES THOSE FIGURES ARE 
QUITE DRAMATIC IN TERMS OF GIRLS 
GETTING INVOLVED IN THESE CRIMES 
ARE YOU SURPRISED 
I AM NOT SURPRISED AT ALL BECAUSE 
I HAVE BEEN DOING SOME SENSITIVE 
CASE WORK ON THESE VERY ISSUES BUT 
I THINK IT IS DIFFICULT TO ANSWER 
THIS COMPLEX QUESTION WITHOUT BEING 
JUDGMENTAL I HAVE BEEN CLOSELY 
INVOLVED WITH KODJO YENGA'S FAMILY 
SINCE HE WAS TRAGICALLY MURDERED 
WHAT ROLE DID GILLES HAVE TO PLAY 
IN THAT CRIME 
IN THIS INSTANCE 
THE BULLYING WAS INSTIGATED BY THE 
YOUNG GIRLS WHO SURROUNDED KODJO 
THEY WERE SCREAMING KILL HIM KILL 
HIM ' GIRLS THE YOUNG BOY WHO WAS 
KILLED HAD COME HERE AS AN ASYLUM 
SEEKER FROM THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 
OF CONGO SO THE VERY COUNTRY OF 
SANCTUARY WAS WHERE HE WAS KILLED 
THERE IS SENSE OF REVULSION IN 
SOCIETY GENERALLY WHEN GIRLS ARE 
S. EEN TO BE INVOLVED IN THESE SORTS 
OF CRIMES WHAT IS IT THAT IS 
ATTRACTING THEM IF YOU LIKE INTO 
GANGS AND VIOLENCE DRINK WAS 
MENTIONED WHAT EVIDENCE HAVE YOU 
GOT 
I THINK WE NEED TO BREAK DOWN GOT THIS TERM TREET CORNER SOCIETY AND 
LOOK AT THE SOCIO ECONOMIC REASONS 
EMOTIONAL ISSUES AND THE 
CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY ARE 
LIVING THE EVIDENCE COMING THROUGH 
FROM THE CASEWORKER I AM DOING 
SEEMS TO POINT OUT THE FACT THAT A 
LOT OF GIRLS ARE FACING WHAT A LOT 
OF STRESS IN TERMS OF TEENAGE 
PREGNANCY POVERTY AS A RESULT OF 
THAT ISSUES OF ESTRANGEMENT WITH 
THEIR FAMILIES AND THE RISK OF 
BEING HOMELESS SUBSTANCE MISUSE 
DRUGS AND ALCOHOL THESE ARE ALL 
MAJOR ISSUES AND THESE HAVE BEEN 
INCREASING AND ALSO THERE ARE 
INITIATION PROCESS IS WITH THE 
GANGS AND THERE IS EVIDENCE OF 
VIOLENCE AGAINST YOUNG WOMEN WHAT WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE 
THERE IS A 
SENSITIVE PIECE OF CASEWORK 
REGARDING A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WITH 
WHOM I DEALT WHERE SHE WAS ASKED 
TO STAB ANOTHER YOUNG GIRL AS A WAY 
OF MOVING UP FROM BEING A YOUNGER 
TWO GOING FURTHER UP IN THE 
HIERARCHY SHE REFUSED TO STAB THE 
OTHER GIRL AND AS A RESULT SHE 
WAS INVITED TO A PARTY AND WENT TO 
THE PARTY AND UNFORTUNATELY SHE 
WAS THE ONLY PERSON AT THE PARTY 
APART FROM A GROUP OF YOUNG BOYS 
WHO ASSAULTED HER AND BRANDED HER 
AS WELL 
THAT IS A VERY SHOCKING 
EXAMPLE OF GIRLS BEING INITIATED 
INTO GANGS IS THERE A SENSE THAT 
THEY ARE STILL THE RARE EXAMPLE 
AND THESE FIGURES ARE MORE ABOUT 
LOW LEVEL FIGHTING BETWEEN GIRLS 
THAT IS NOW BEING REPORTED OR IS 
IT THAT KIND OF VIOLENT CRIME WHICH 
IS REALLY ON THE UP 
I THINK IT'S 
JUST SOMETHING THAT WE'RE SO 
STAGGERED ABOUT THAT IT IS 
NOTEWORTHY NOW HOWEVER I AM 
DEALING WITH OTHER INSTANCES WHERE 
GOALS ARE PART OF THE GANG CULTURE 
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY 
NEED TO STAMP ON TO A LARGE EXTENT 
THERE IS A SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS 
AND LACK OF OPTIONS AT THE MOMENT 
AND SO I THINK THE PROPOSALS THAT 
WERE LAUNCHED YESTERDAY BY GORDON 
BROWN ARE VERY POSITIVE FROM THE 
POINT OF VIEW OF SKILLS AND 
EDUCATION AND WHAT HAS BEEN 
HIGHLIGHTED IN TERMS OF LIFE AND 
LEARNING SO THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE 
HAVE OPTIONS IN TERMS OF 
APPRENTICESHIPS THAT CAN GIVE THEM 
A POSITIVE WAY FORWARD 
SO YOU ARE 
SEEING WAYS OUT THROUGH EDUCATION 
WHAT ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON THE NEW 
MAYOR OF LONDON AND HIS PROPOSALS 
TO TACKLE MY CRIME WHAT MESSAGE 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEND TO HIM 
THERE ARE THREE KEY MESSAGES IT 
IS IMPORTANT THAT WE INVOLVE YOUNG 
PEOPLE IN IDENTIFYING THE SOLUTIONS 
OF HOW TO OVERCOME GUN AND KNIFE 
RELATED CRIME WOULD VERY MUCH 
LIKE TO BE INVOLVED IN A WIDE 
REACHING AND GENUINE CONSULTATION 
WITH YOUNG PEOPLE THAT LEADS INTO A 
CONSULTATION TO ASK HIM PEOPLE 
ACROSS LONDON WHAT WOULD MAKE THEM 
FEEL SAFE ENOUGH TO STOP CARRYING 
KNIVES AND GUNS 
THANKS WE USED 
DAY WITH US WE WILL PROBABLY COME 
BACK TO YOU 
THE MINISTER BILL RAMMELL IS WITH 
US THIS GOVERNMENT PROMISED TO BE 
TOUGH ON CRIME AND TOUGH ON THE 
CAUSES OF CRIME BUT THERE IS 
CLEARLY AN EPIDEMIC OF THE CRIME 
WHICH PEOPLE FEAR MOST WHICH IS 
VIOLENT CRIME WHAT HAS GONE WRONG 
SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT HAVE BEEN 
QUOTED ARE SHOCKING L. DON'T 
DISPUTE THAT BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE 
OVERALL CONTEXT 
I AM TALKING 
ABOUT VIOLENT CRIME EVERY TIME I 
INTERVIEW A MINISTER THEY GO ON TO 
THE OVERALL PICTURE CRIME HAS COME 
DOWN FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS CARS 
ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO BREAK INTO 
PEOPLE HAVE ALARMS ON THEIR HOUSES 
LET'S TAKE THAT AS A GIVEN THAT 
OVERALL FIGURES HAVE FALLEN TELL 
ME WHY VIOLENT CRIME HAS NOT BEEN 
TACKLED 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURES TACKLED VIOLENT CRIME HAS COME DOWN BUT 
LET'S LOOK AT THE YOUTH JUSTICE 
BOARD FIGURES OUT TODAY THEY SHOW 
A TWO PER CENT REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF 
YOUNG PEOPLE ENGAGING IN CRIME THE 
FIGURES FOR BOYS THE MAJOR 
PERPETRATORS HAVE GONE DOWN QUITE 
A BIT BUT THE FIGURES FOR GIRLS 
HAVE GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY AND I 
THINK ANY POLITICIAN WHO SAYS TO 
YOU THAT THEY HAVE A GLIB QUICK 
FIX SOLUTION TO THAT IS EITHER 
MISLEADING THEMSELVES OR MISLEADING 
OTHER PEOPLE CLEARLY ALCOHOL HAS 
A ROLE TO PLAY HERE 
WE ARE NOT 
EXPECTING QUICK FIXES YOU HAVE 
BEEN IN POWER FOR ELEVEN YEARS 
ABSOLUTELY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN IN RESPECT 
OF ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR ORDERS 
DISPOSAL ORDERS THEY ARE HAVING 
REAL IMPACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
MEASURE THAT JACKIE SMITH HAS M. 
HAS OUTLINED TODAY THAT WE ARE 
GOING TO RECORD CRIME FOR THE 
UNDER SIXTEENS JACQUI SMITH TO GET A 
MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING THAT 
WILL HELP US 
BUT THIRTEEN TEENAGERS 
HAVE BEEN MURDERED IN THIS CITY 
SOME OF THEM IN THE MOST BRUTAL WAY 
LAST YEAR IT WAS TWENTY SEVEN AT THE 
CURRENT RUN RATE THERE WILL BE A 
LOT MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN YOUNG LIVES 
DESTROYED FOREVER IT'S GETTING 
WORSE 
AND THAT IS SHOCKING AND WORSE UNACCEPTABLE WHAT I CAN SAY TO YOU 
IS THAT OVERALL THE SITUATION IS 
IMPROVING BUT ANY YOUNG LIFE THAT 
IS TAKEN 
HAVE YOU SEEN THE 
SCENES FROM MANCHESTER LAST NIGHT 
OF GLASGOW RANGERS FANS ON THE 
RAMPAGED IN DOWNTOWN MANCHESTER 
ON THE RAMPAGE YOU REALLY THINK 
THIS IS A WELL BEHAVED COUNTRY NO NO I THINK THERE ARE EXCESSES OF 
BEHAVIOUR AND CONDUCT THAT ARE 
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE WE HAVE TO 
CONSIDER THE CAN MEASURES WITH 
TOUGHER PENALTIES THE ANTI SOCIAL 
BEHAVIOUR LEGISLATION THE FACT 
THAT SENTENCING IS MUCH TOUGHER 
THAN IT EVER WAS IN THE PAST YOU 
WOULDN'T HAVE THE SIGNIFICANT 
INCREASE IN THE PRISON POPULATION 
WERE THAT NOT THE CASE BUT 
UNDOUBTEDLY WILL YOU DO HAVE 
INSTANCES LIKE AMONGST YOUNG GIRLS 
THE LEVEL OF CRIME INCREASING WE 
DO NEED TO TACKLE THAT 
ARE PEOPLE RIGHT TO BE FRIGHTENED 
OF TIME ANYONE A VICTIM OF CRIME 
IT IS APPALLING 
BUT ARE PEOPLE 
RIGHT PARTICULARLY IN SOME OF THE 
POORER PARTS OF THIS COUNTRY ARE 
THEY RIGHT TO FEAR AS THEY WALK THE 
STREETS 
PEOPLE HAVE GENUINE FEARS STREETS BUT IT IS OFTEN THE FEAR OF CRIME 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE REALITY SO SO THEY ARE WRONG 
NO I'M 
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
LEGITIMATE FEARS PEOPLE ARE MUCH 
LESS LIKELY TO BE THE VICTIMS OF 
CRIME THAN IN THE PAST 
REALLY NOT 
IF YOU ARE A TEENAGER IN LONDON 
MINISTER MINISTER SPEAKING OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON 
HAS BEEN MAYOR FOR A FORTNIGHT BUT 
SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING HIMSELF THERE 
HE IS TRYING OUT HIS DESK FOR SIZE 
AT HIS OFFICE IN CITY HALL HE HAD 
TROUBLE WITH HIS PASSPORT BUT 
DON'T WE ALL WHEN STARTING A NEW 
JOB THIS MORNING HE MET THE 
CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING HIS 
FIRST FORMAL MEETING NO DOUBT THEY 
WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO 
LONDON'S POSITION AS THE KEY 
FINANCIAL CENTRE THIS ECONOMIC 
TURMOIL WHICH IS GLOBAL IS ABOVE 
ALL FINANCIAL SO THE CITY OF 
LONDON COULD SUFFER MORE THAN 
ANYWHERE ELSE WE ARE JOINED BY 
BORIS JOHNSON MR. MAYOR WELCOME TO 
THE PROGRAMME 
THANK YOU 
WHAT DID 
YOU WANT THE FROM THE CHANCELLOR 
WHEN YOU SAW HIM TODAY 
I WANTED TO 
HEAR FROM HIS OWN LIPS WHAT 
EVERYBODY AGREES THAT LONDON IS THE 
MOTOR NOT JUST OF THE ENGLISH BUT 
THE U. K. ECONOMY AND HATE TO BE 
PROPERLY SUPPORTED I'M GLAD HE 
CONFIRMED HIS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT COMMITMENT TO 
CROSSRAIL 
CROSSRAIL WILL GO AHEAD CROSSRAIL IT WILL GO AHEAD AND TO THE UP 
GRADING OF THE TUBE WHICH EVERYONE 
WANTS HE TOTALLY AGREES IF WE ARE 
TO MAINTAIN LONDON'S LEAD AS THE 
GREATEST FINANCIAL CENTRE YOU HAVE 
TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE 
LONDON'S INFRASTRUCTURE IS 
DILAPIDATED IN PARTS 
IT IS AND 
ONE OF THE PARADOXES IS THAT AS YOU 
IN PROVE IT FOR INSTANCE WHEN WE 
UP GRADE THE SIGNALLING THAT WILL 
BRING THE TRAINS QUICKER THROUGH 
THE STATIONS QUICKER BUT YOU WILL 
NEED AIR CONDITIONING BECAUSE OF 
THE KINETIC ENERGY 
WHAT DID YOU 
GET FROM HIM WHERE YOU DIDN'T GET 
SUCH A GENEROUS REPLY 
IT WAS A 
PRETTY CORDIAL RELAXED PERHAPS 
GUARDED CONVERSATION 
LE WAS 
PERHAPS TRYING TO GET THE MEASURE 
OF YOU 
HE DIDN'T REFUSE ANY OF MY 
REQUESTS ONE THING I WAS EMPHATIC 
ABOUT LONDON'S LEAD AS THE WORLD 
FINANCIAL CENTRE AND THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH WHAT WE SHOULDN'T DID IS 
OVERREGULATE NOW IN RESPONSE TO 
THAT CRISIS AND THEREBY PRODUCE 
THE NEXT CRISIS SO I SAID WHATEVER 
YOU DO DON'T PRODUCE NEW TAXES OR 
E. U. REGULATIONS 
WHEN LONDON WAS 
BOOMING KEN LIVINGSTONE TOOK THE 
CREDIT FOR IT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS 
PROBABLY NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM IF 
LONDON STARTS TO DECLINE OR GOES 
INTO RECESSION WHICH THE GOVERNOR 
OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND SAID IS A 
PORBLGTS YOU WILL PROBABLY GET THE 
BLAME POSSIBILITY YOU WILL GET 
THE BLAME FOR IT 
IT IS MY JOB TO 
MAKE SURE IT HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND THE SUPPORT TO WEATHER ANY 
STORM 
AREN'T YOU GOING TO GET STORM FRUSTRATED GIVEN THE POWERS THAT A 
MAYOR OF LONDON HAS THAT WHEN IT 
COMES TO THE BIG ISSUES OF 
ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH COMPANIES WORK 
THE ABILITY TO TRY AND KEEP LONDON 
NUMBER ONE YOU HAVE VERY FEW TOOLS 
IN THE BOX AS MAYOR OF LONDON 
THERE'S TWO SIDES TO IT AS MAYOR 
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS MAKE THE 
PLACE SAFE AND ATTRACTIVE 
THEREFORE FOR TOP TALENT TO COME 
HERE AND WORK HERE AND YOU HAVE 
GOT TO MAKE SURE THE INFRASTRUCTURE 
IS WORKING WITH OUR TRANSPORT 
SYSTEM IS DELIVERING PEOPLE TO WORK 
ON TIME THAT IS DIRECTLY IN MY 
COMPETENCE BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE 
OTHER SIDE IS TO BE A CHAMPION AND 
AMBASSADOR FOR LONDON TO SPEAK UP 
FOR LONDON 
IT IS MORE SYMBOLIC 
THAN THE POWER ISN'T IT TOGETHER TOGETHER WITH THE CITY AND THE BANK AND THE 
LORD MAYOR YOU CAN WEIGH IN AND 
STOP GOVERNMENT MAKING ELEMENTARY 
MISTAKES LIKE THE AMERICANS MADE 
AFTER THE ENRON DISASTER 
LET ME 
COME TO ANOTHER ISSUE CRIME 
PARTICULARLY YOUTH CRIME L. WAS 
TALKING TO THE MINISTER ABOUT IT 
YOU WANT TO CHAIR THE METROPOLITAN 
POLICE BOARD BUT DON'T YOU RUN THE 
RISKS OF BEING FRUSTRATED WHEN YOU 
WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABILITIES 
CRIME IN LONDON AT THE END OF THE 
DAY YOU HAVE VERY FEW TOOLS IN THE 
BOX 
I'M NOT SURE THAT IS TRUE IF BOX YOU LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE UNDER THE 
PRESENT CONSTITUTION THE LONDON 
MAYOR CIBTSZ EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION TO THE 
CONTRIBUTES EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION TO THE 
POLICE BUDGET YOU PAY THE PIE PER 
YOU CALL THE TUNE WE ARE WORKING 
CLOSELY WITH THE MET OPERATION 
BLUNT THEY ARE GOING SOUTH INTO 
PROBLEM NEIGHBOURHOODS AND LIFTING 
THE GUNS AND KNIFES SO FAR AS THEY 
ARE ABLE TO DO THAT SENSITIVELY 
WITHOUT CAUSING PROBLEMS WITH STOP 
AND SEARCH WE ARE ENCOURAGING AND 
SUPPORTING THAT YOU CAN MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE 
BUT UNLIKE THE MAYOR OF DIFFERENCE NEW YORK LOS ANGELES OR CHICAGO 
YOU DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO ENFORCE 
A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY OF THE 
KIND THAT WAS SO SUCCESSFUL UNDER 
MAYOR GIULIANI IN NEW YORK WHAT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS STOP THE CULTURE OF 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT TOLERANCE OF MINOR CRIME AND 
DISORDER 
WOULD YOU DO THAT I'VE DISORDER I'VE PUT SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON WHAT IS 
WRONG WITH PUBLIC TRANSPORT YOU 
SHOULD HAVE COME WITH ME AROUND 
LONDON'S BOROUGHS AND YOU WILL MEET 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 
AGGRIEVED THAT THEIR JOURNEYS ARE 
DISRUPTED 
YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE DISRUPTED AWAY THE OYSTER CARD 
TOMORROW WE 
ARE GOING TO DOUBLE UP THE SAFETY 
TEAMS AND HAVE MANY MORE UNIFORMED 
OFFICERS ON TRANSPORT HUBS AND IF 
KIDS MISBEHAVE WE WILL TAKE AWAY 
THEIR RIGHT TO FREE TRAVEL THAT 
WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE 
CLIMATE OF TRAVEL ON THE BUSES MY 
INTENTION IS TO DRIVE OUT MINOR 
CRIME AND DISORDER AND WORKING WITH 
THE POLICE AND EVERYBODY ELSE TO 
DRIVE OUT MORE SERIOUS CRIME I I UNDERSTAND THAT IN NEW YORK IF YOU 
ARE THE MAYOR AND YOU WANT THE 
POLICE TO TAKE A PARTICULAR LINE 
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD TAKE 
THE STREETS BACK FOR DECENT PEOPLE 
AND THE POLICE DIDN'T DO THAT YOU 
WOULD HAVE THE POWER TO FIRE THE 
CHIEF OF POLICE AND BRING SOMEONE 
IN YOU CANNOT FIRE THE CHIEF OF 
POLICE SHOULD YOU BE ABLE TO YES YES IN MY VIEW IT SHOULD BE THE POWER 
OF THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED 
MAYORAL TI TO HIRE AND FIRE THE 
PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICING IN 
LONDON 
LONDON IS A BIGGER JOB LONDON CORRECT HE HAS A NATIONAL 
DIMENSION HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
COUNTER TERRORISM ACROSS BRITAIN 
THE PROTECTION OF THE ROYAL FAMILY 
AND THE REST OF IT THERE IS 
WINNOWING OUT JOB 
YOU HAVE YOUR 
HANDS FULL YOU WILL CHAIR THE 
POLICE BOARD AND ANOTHER BOARD 
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LONDON 
TRANSPORT WHY ARE YOU ALSO GOING 
TO WRITE A COLUMN FOR THE DAILY 
TELEGRAPH 
I THINK THE PEOPLE OF TELEGRAPH LONDON WON'T MIND IF I SPEND MY 
SUNDAY EVENINGS CHURNING OUT A 
COLUMN I REMIND THEM 
YOU ARE 
CHURNING OUT THE READERS OF THE 
TELEGRAPH 
THEIR PREVIOUS MAYOR TELEGRAPH WROTE FOR THE MORNING STAR AND THE 
INDEPENDENT I THINK YOU WOULD 
AGREE ANDREW THERE IS NO PARTICULAR 
REASON NOT TO TREAT JOURNALISM AS 
ANOTHER WAY OF EXPRESSING YOUR 
VIEWS 
ISN'T THE MAYOR OF THE VIEWS GREATEST CITY OF THE WORLD A FULL 
TIME JOB 
OF COURSE IT IS 
SO DO 
YOU JUST NEED THE MONEY 
AND I 
THINK IT SERBLTD THAT I SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO ESSENTIAL THAT I SHOULD 
BE ABLE TO CONVEY TO A WIRED 
AUDIENCE MY VIEWS ON A WIDE RANGE 
OF SUBJECTS L. SEE NO HARM AT ALL 
I THINK THE DAILY TELEGRAPH IS A 
BETTER PLATFORM THAN A BLOG 
REALLY IT DEPENDS ON THE PLOG 
ENHENRY SAYS HOW LONG BEFORE THE 
NEW STYLE ROUTEMASTER ALSO BE ON 
THE STREETS 
HENRY YOU WILL SEE AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT SHORTLY ABOUT OUR 
PLANS TO PHASE OUT THE ARTICULATED 
BUSES WE ARE GOING TO COMMISSION A 
COMPETITION TO LAUNCH A NEW 
GENERATION ROUTEMASTER 
WILL YOU 
COME BACK AND SPEAK TO US 
REGULARLY 
IT WOULD BE AN HONOUR REGULARLY AS PART OF YOUR BLOG AND COLUMN IF 
YOU CAN FIT US MR. MAYOR THANK YOU 
FOR JOINING US 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS BEEN HOLDING 
HIS MONTHSLY PRESS CONFERENCE AND 
REITERATING HIS MESSAGE NA HE IS 
THE MAN TO MANAGE THE ECONOMY WE WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK HARD TO STEER 
THE ECONOMY THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES 
I THINK THE EXPERIENCE I'VE BUILT 
UP OVER ELEVEN YEARS ENABLES ME TO DO 
THE RIGHT THINGS BY THE BRITISH 
ECONOMY WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO 
TAKE WHAT EVER ACTION IS NECESSARY 
TO BRING THE BRITISH ECONOMY 
THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT TIMES BUT 
PEOPLE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT WHILE 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS RISING IN AMERICA 
AT A VERY FAST RATE AND WHILE WE 
HAVE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT IN FRANCE 
AND GERMANY ALTHOUGH WE HAD A 
SMALL RISE YESTERDAY WE HAVE SEEN 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE INTO JOBS IN THE 
LAST YEAR BRITISH EMPLOYMENT 
HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY 
JOINING US 
FROM DOWNING STREET IS OUR OLD 
FRIEND LAURA KUENSSBERG LESS OF 
THE OLD SHE'S BEEN LISTENING TO 
THE PRIME MINISTER GORDON BROWN 
HAS DONE A ROUND OF INTERVIEW THIS 
IS MORNING AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF 
THAT DRAFT LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 
IT'S ALL BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY NA 
GLOOMY OUTLOOK FROM THE GOVERNOR OF 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND THAT STILL THE 
THEME OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE I I THINK IT IS AND MOST JOURNALIST 
ALSO BE GLOOMY AS THEY COME OUT OF 
NUMBER TEN TRY AS THEY MIGHT THE 
JOURNALISTS HAVE ENDED ONE THE SAME 
ANSWER A KIT OF PARTS WITH THIS 
IDENTIKIT MESSAGE MENTION THE 
ECONOMY AND HIGH OIL PRICES AND 
GORDON BROWN WILL MENTION YET AGAIN 
NA IN HIS VIEW DESPITE THE GLOOMY 
FORECAST HE IS THE MAN BEST EQUIP 
TO DO STEER THE COUNTRY THROUGH 
THESE TURBULENT TIME IT'S ONE 
JOURNALIST INVITED HIM TO GIVE AN 
APPRAISAL OF HIMSELF AS WE ARE 
REQUIRED TO DO IN OUR JOBS BUT THE 
PRIME MINISTER WAS ADAMANT HE WOULD 
ONLY GIVE US HIS FAVOURITE ANSWER 
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME TIME AND AGAIN 
IT IS GOING ON FOR ANOTHER HALF AN 
HOUR ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES MIGHT 
HAVE 
FAR NOTHING 
REALLY THAT SOUNDS ANY DIFFERENT 
FROM WHAT WE HAVE HEARD IN THE LAST 
FORTY EIGHT HOURS 
SO NO PERSONAL INSIGHT 
INTO THE TROUBLES HE IS GOING 
THROUGH 
WE ARE SEEING A SATURATION THROUGH STRATEGY ONE OF THE OLD CHARGES 
PUT AGAINST GORDON BROWN IS HE USED 
TO DO A DISAPPEARING ACT WHEN 
THINGS GOT DIFFICULT THIS TIME NOT 
A BIT OF IT HE'S BEEN BARGING INTO 
EVERYONE'S LIVING ROOMS UP AND DOWN 
THE COUNTRY BY APPEARING ON ALMOST 
EVERY TELEVISION OUTLET THAT WOULD 
HAVE HIM HE IS PUTTING HIMSELF OUT 
AND ABOUT ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT 
STILL NO SIGN OF HIM GOING UP TO 
CREWE FOR THAT IMPORTANT BY 
ELECTION HE IS STAYING WELL AWAY 
FROM THAT SO FAR 
THAT CRUCIAL BY 
ELECTION IS NEXT WEEK WE'LL BE 
HAVING A DAILY POLITICS SPECIAL 
NEXT FRIDAY ON THE CREWE BY 
ELECTION THE AFTERMATH YOU HAVE 
BEEN THE CREWE WHY DIDN'T THEY USE 
THE PRIME MINISTER'S PICTURE ON THE 
LABOUR PROPAGANDA 
I DON'T KNOW 
ABOUT THAT BUT IN TERMS OF GORDON 
BROWN GOING TO THE BY ELECTION I 
THINK I'M RIGHT IN SAYING THAT TONY 
BLAIR AS PRIME MINISTER DIDN'T 
VISIT THE BY ELECTION 
BECAUSE IF 
YOU VISIT ONE YOU HAVE TO VISIT 
THEM ALL EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE NO 
CHANCE OF WINNING 
IN TERMS OF THE 
GENERAL POLITICAL SITUATION ANDREW 
AT THE MOMENT WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE 
OF A THIRD TERM LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
IN THE MIDST OF AN INTERNATIONAL 
CREDIT SQUEEZE PEOPLE ARE REACTING 
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OUR TASK IS 
TO SHIFT FROM THAT TO LOOK AT THE 
CONTRAST BETWEEN THIS GOVERNMENT 
AND AN ALTERNATIVE CONSERVATIVE ONE 
THEN I THINK WE ARE MUCH BETTER 
PLACED 
WE SHALL SEE 
THE VIEWER PLACED ALSO DECIDE WHEN DID THESE PLACED 
PRIME 
ALSO DECIDE WHEN DID THESE PRIME MINISTERIAL PRESS CONFERENCES TAKE 
PLACE 
THINK IT WAS JUNE TWO THOUSAND TWO I I THINK WE ARE AGREED ON IT WELL 
DONE L. HAD NO IDEA THANKS TO ALL 
OUR GUEST AND A SPECIFIC THANKS TO 
YOU BILL RAMMELL WHO CAME IN AT 
THE LAST MINUTES L. WILL BE BACK

ALL THE OTHER POLITICAL STORIES OF 
THE DAY DO JOIN HER THEN BYE BYE
