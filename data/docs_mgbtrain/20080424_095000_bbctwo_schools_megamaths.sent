DEEP IN SPACE LIES SUPERHERO SCHOOL 
ITS NEXT STUDENT IS BOLDLY GOING TO LEARN WHAT NO SUPERHERO HAS LEARNED BEFORE 
YES THIS IS THE STORY OF MATHS MAN 
HE LOVES TO KEEP IN SHAPE 
IT'S MATHS MAN 
MATHS MAN EXPECTED IN THREE TWO ONE SECONDS 
HI MATHS TEAM I'M MATHS MAN MATHEMATICAL SUPERHERO AT YOUR SERVICE 
WELCOME TO THE LEARNING POD MATHS MAN THANKS 
THIS IS VERA THE SHIP'S ON BOARD COMPUTER 
SHE'S TEACHING ME ALL ABOUT SHAPES AND SPACE 
THIS IS A TWO DIMENSIONAL SHAPE A SQUARE 
THIS IS A THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPE A CUBE 
I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I AM MATHS MAN OR M. M. FOR SHORT 
HERE ONE OF MY M.'S IS MISSING 
HIS WHOLENESS EXPECTED IN SIX SECONDS 
OH NO I WONDER WHERE IT IS 
THERE IT IS 
HE'LL NEVER KNOW 
AH ONE OF YOUR M.'S DROPPED OFF DID IT MATHS MAN HOW DID YOU KNOW 
YOU'VE PUT IT ON UPSIDE DOWN 
IT NOW READS MW 
WHICH COULD STAND FOR MATHS WOMAN 
TO BE RIGHT IT MUST BE THE SAME AS THE OTHER M. IT MUST BE SYMMETRICAL 
KEEP PERFECTLY STILL IMAGINE THERE IS A LINE RUNNING DOWN YOUR BODY 
EVERYTHING ON THIS HALF IS THE SAME AS EVERYTHING ON THAT HALF 
FIND A POSITION FOR THAT M. WHICH MATCHES THIS M. 
THEN BOTH WILL BE SYMMETRICAL 
THERE MATHS MAN 
MATHS MAN I'M STILL FROZEN 
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY 
TODAY'S LESSON WILL BE ALL ABOUT SYMMETRY 
ALL YOU NEED IS IN THOSE CRYSTALS 
ANY PROBLEMS ASK VERA 
YES QUITE 
O. K. VERA DO YOUR STUFF 
ON EARTH YOU WILL FIND SYMMETRY EVERYWHERE 
IN BUILDINGS LIKE THIS BRIDGE 
IN NATURE LIKE THIS SNOWFLAKE 
WHERE DO YOU START START WITH SYMMETRY IN SHAPES 
IN TWO DIMENSIONAL SHAPES YOU CAN SHOW SYMMETRY BY MAKING A LINE OR FOLD 
TO SPLIT THE SHAPE IN TWO 
SO THAT ONE SIDE IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE OTHER 
THE LINE IS CALLED A. 
YOU CAN CHECK THAT BOTH SIDES ARE SYMMETRICAL BY FOLDING THE SHAPE IN HALF 
IF THE SHAPE FOLDS OVER SO THAT EACH SIDE FITS TOGETHER EXACTLY 
THEN WE CAN SAY THAT BOTH SIDES ARE SYMMETRICAL 
A SQUARE HAS FOUR LINES OF SYMMETRY 
IF YOU FOLD ON THESE LINES EACH HALF FITS TOGETHER EXACTLY 
FOLD A SQUARE IN ANY OTHER POSITION AND THEY DON'T FIT TOGETHER EXACTLY 
SO THESE ARE NOT LINES OF SYMMETRY 
DO ALL FOUR SIDED SHAPES I MEAN QUADRILATERALS HAVE LINES OF SYMMETRY 
TRY FOLDING THE PARALLELOGRAM ON THE WORK BENCH 
ALL RIGHT 
EASY 
THIS IS A PARALLELOGRAM 
IT'S A LAZY RECTANGLE 
RIGHT NOW THEN I'LL MAKE A FOLD 
HERE 
AND 
OH WELL THAT DOESN'T FOLD EXACTLY DOES IT NO 
I KNOW I'LL MAKE A FOLD HERE 
OH THAT DOESN'T FOLD EXACTLY EITHER 
A PARALLELOGRAM HAS NO LINES OF SYMMETRY 
WHEREVER YOU FOLD IT ONE SIDE IS BIGGER OR SMALLER THAN THE OTHER 
NOW THAT IS WORTH REMEMBERING WHAT'S WORTH REMEMBERING MATHS MAN 
THAT A PARALLELOGRAM HAS NO LINES OF SYMMETRY YES YES IT IS 
I TRUST YOU'VE REMEMBERED SOME OTHER THINGS TOO SOUNDS LIKE A CHALLENGE 
VIRTUAL REALITY GLASSES NO GLASSES MATHS MAN 
THIS TIME YOU NEED THESE 
AN EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE AND AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE 
HOW MANY LINES OF SYMMETRY DO THEY HAVE 
TICK TOCK TICK TOCK OH RIGHT YES YES 
I'LL FOLD TELL ME IF IT'S SYMMETRICAL WE'LL BEGIN WITH THE EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE 
IS THAT A LINE OF SYMMETRY 
YES BOTH SIDES LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME HEY HEY 
RIGHT THAT'S ONE LINE OF SYMMETRY 
THERE 
IS THAT A LINE OF SYMMETRY 
YES BOTH HALVES DO LOOK THE SAME 
THAT'S TWO LINES OF SYMMETRY 
AND LET'S TRY ONE MORE HERE 
THERE IS THIS A LINE OF SYMMETRY 
YES 
HO HO 
I THINK THERE ARE THREE LINES OF SYMMETRY IN AN EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE 
OH YAH HOO YOU'RE REALLY COOL 
THERE ARE THREE LINES OF SYMMETRY IN AN EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE 
O. K. THE ISOSCELES TRIANGLE 
WHERE SHALL I BEGIN OH I KNOW I'LL MAKE A FOLD HERE 
IS THIS SYMMETRICAL OH BOTH SIDES DON'T FIT TOGETHER EXACTLY 
I KNOW I'LL MAKE A FOLD HERE 
IS THIS SYMMETRICAL OH BOTH SIDES AREN'T THE SAME 
ER I KNOW ONE LAST FOLD LET'S TRY THIS IS THIS SYMMETRICAL 
AH IS THIS A LINE 
YES I THINK THERE IS ONE LINE OF SYMMETRY 
OH YAH HOO YOU REALLY ARE COOL 
AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE HAS ONE LINE OF SYMMETRY 
YES MATHS MAN AND MATHS TEAM MASTERS OF SYMMETRY 
AH NOW STEADY ON MATHS MAN THERE'S MORE 
MORE YES REFLECTIONS 
VERA 
THIS IS A FAMOUS EARTH BUILDING CALLED THE TAJ MAHAL 
IN THE WATER YOU CAN SEE ITS REFLECTION 
THE REFLECTION IS THE SAME SIZE AND THE SAME SHAPE AS THE BUILDING 
THEY'RE IDENTICAL HANG ON A SECOND 
THEY LOOK THE SAME BUT THE REFLECTION'S UPSIDE DOWN CORRECT 
YOU WILL SEE WHY IN A MOMENT 
THE LINE DIVIDING THE BUILDING AND ITS REFLECTION IS THE MIRROR LINE 
THE MIRROR LINE IS LIKE THE FOLD LINE WE SAW EARLIER 
LET'S SEE SOMETHING ELSE THAT REFLECTS 
WOW A MIRROR 
WHY NOT HAVE A GO REFLECT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR 
THERE'S ONE OF ME 
NOW THERE ARE TWO OF ME 
AND 
GOOD THE LINE RUNNING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF YOU IS A MIRROR LINE 
SO THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF YOUR BODY IS REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR 
TRY MOVING ABOUT 
O. K. IF I WAVE MY REFLECTION IS WAVING 
IF I SCRATCH MY HEAD I'M SCRATCHING MY HEAD AS WELL 
SO WHATEVER IS ON THIS SIDE OF THE MIRROR HAPPENS ON THE OTHER SIDE 
HEY WATCH THIS 
TA D. A. 
TA D. A. 
CAN WE GET ON MATHS MAN HERE IS A SHAPE 
IF YOU HELD IT UP TO THE MIRROR LINE WHAT NEW SHAPE WILL IT MAKE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK LET'S FIND OUT 
HERE GOES 
THERE 
WOW IT'S A STAR HEY HEY 
WE KNOW WHEN WE REFLECT SOMETHING THE SHAPE AND THE SIZE REMAINS THE SAME 
WATCH WHAT ELSE HAPPENS 
WOW WELL THE SHAPE IT'S BEEN FOLDED OVER 
IT HAS 
IT'S BEEN FLIPPED OVER SO IT LOOKS THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
COULD I SEE THE TAJ MAHAL AGAIN 
OH YES 
THE TAJ MAHAL WAS FLIPPED OVER AS WELL 
THE REASON THE REFLECTION IN THE WATER IS UPSIDE DOWN 
IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU REFLECT SOMETHING YOU FLIP IT OVER YES I SEE GOOD MATHS MAN 
LET'S GET RID OF THE MIRROR AND TAKE A SEAT TO WATCH ARTISTS USING SYMMETRY IN THEIR WORK 
THIS IS SHOBHNA NAIMA AND PRATHIMA 
THEY ARE RANGOLI ARTISTS AND ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS RANGOLI PATTERN 
WATCH 
THEY START BY DRAWING OUT EACH SHAPE AND THEN FILLING THE COLOUR 
IF YOU LOOK THIS RANGOLI PATTERN IS SYMMETRICAL 
IMAGINE THERE'S A MIRROR LINE DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOARD 
SO WHAT IS DRAWN ON ONE SIDE OF THE BOARD IS REFLECTED ON THE OTHER SIDE 
BUT DON'T FORGET THE REFLECTED SHAPE HAS TO BE THE SAME IN SIZE 
FLIPPED OVER AND IN EXACTLY THE SAME POSITION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR LINE 
LOOK AT THIS TRIANGLE IT IS THREE DOTS AWAY FROM THE MIRROR LINE 
SO ITS REFLECTION IS THREE DOTS FROM THE MIRROR LINE AS WELL 
NOW LOOK AT THIS HEXAGON 
IT IS SEVEN DOTS AWAY FROM THE MIRROR LINE 
SO ITS REFLECTION IS SEVEN DOTS AWAY FROM THE MIRROR LINE ALSO 
AND THERE YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL SYMMETRICAL RANGOLI PATTERN 
VERA COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT PART AGAIN 
ABOUT THE REFLECTION HAVING TO BE THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE MIRROR LINE CERTAINLY 
OUR RANGOLI ARTISTS USE DOTS TO HELP THEM FIND THE RIGHT POSITION FOR THEIR SHAPES 
YOU CAN ALSO USE A GRID THIS IS THE MIRROR LINE 
THIS ISOSCELES TRIANGLE IS TWO SQUARES AWAY FROM THE MIRROR LINE 
SO THIS TRIANGLE'S REFLECTION HAS TO BE TWO SQUARES AWAY AS WELL 
THANKS VERA 
THERE YOU ARE HOW DID YOU GET ON WITH REFLECTIONS I DID QUITE WELL 
THE SHAPE AND SIZE REMAIN THE SAME AND THE REFLECTION IS FLIPPED OVER 
FINALLY THE IMAGE HAS TO BE IN EXACTLY THE SAME POSITION ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MIRROR LINE 
SPLENDID TIME FOR A CHALLENGE THIS TIME YOU WILL NEED YOUR GLASSES 
O. K. HERE WE GO 
I'M READY TO CALL OUT THE ANSWERS 
GREETINGS TWO D. THREE D. GREETINGS TIME FOR SOME REFLECTION UESTIONS WITH SOME FUN SHAPES 
HERE IS A TRUCKAND A MIRROR LINE 
HERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE REFLECTIONS 
WHICH IS THE CORRECT REFLECTION 
I THINK IT'S 
A 
YAH HOO YOU'RE REALLY COOL 
THE ANSWER IS A 
THE TRUCK IN B. IS NL T. IN THE RIGHT POSITION 
IT NEEDS TO BE CLOSER TO THE MIRROR LINE 
I YOUR N. E. T. UESTION 
HERE IS THE LETTER I AND A MIRROR LINE 
HERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE REFLECTIONS 
WHICH IS THE CORRECT REFLECTION 
COME ON TEAM CALL OUT 
I THINK IT'S 
B. 
YAH HOO YOU'RE REALLY COOL 
THE ANSWER IS B. 
THE LETTER IN A IS TOO BIG AND NEEDS TO BE FLIPPED OVER 
BYE BYE EE YOU N. E. T. TIME 
COOL TWO OUT OF TWO WELL THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT NOW MATHS MAN 
YOUR FINAL CHALLENGE AWAITS YOU ON EARTH HERE ARE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS 
I HOPE YOU'RE GOOD AT CRACKING RIDDLES 
MATHS MAN YOUR CHALLENGE IS TO FIND THREE DIFFERENT SYMMETRICAL ITEMS DESCRIBED IN THE RIDDLES 
THEY ARE WITHIN THE CASTLE GROUNDS 
GOOD LUCK 
RIGHT CLUE NUMBER ONE 
LOOK AROUND BUT LOOK UP HIGH 
YOU'LL SEE ME FLAPPING IN THE SKY 
LOOK AROUND BUT LOOK UP HIGH YOU'LL SEE ME FLAPPING IN THE SKY 
WELL THERE'S A TOWER THAT'S QUITE HIGH 
THERE'S NOTHING FLAPPING AROUND IT 
AHA 
FLAPS IN THE SKY I WONDER IF THAT'S IT 
I CAN'T TELL LIKE THIS CAN YOU 
I KNOW WHAT IT NEEDS 
NOW IF THERE WAS A LINE ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE FLAG WOULD THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM LOOK THE SAME 
YES OH AND IF THERE WAS A LINE DOWN THE CENTRE OF THE FLAG WOULD THE LEFT AND RIGHT HALVES LOOK THE SAME 
YES 
IT IS SYMMETRICAL 
IT HAS TWO LINES OF SYMMETRY 
OH SPLENDID THAT'S ONE 
TIME FOR THE SECOND CLUE RIGHT 
I'M MADE OF STEEL I'M NOT LIGHT BUT I'LL KEEP YOU SAFE IN A FIGHT 
STEEL LIGHT 
FIGHT 
HELLO I'M MATHS MAN I WONDER COULD YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME 
WOULD YOU MIND DROPPING YOUR VISOR DOWN AT YOUR SERVICE SQUIRE 
THANK YOU 
OH SOMETHING'S NOT QUITE RIGHT 
OH YES YES YES 
WOULD YOU MIND PUTTING YOUR BOW AND ARROW DOWN FOR A SECOND 
SMASHING DO YOU SEE 
IF YOU DRAW A LINE FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM YOU'VE GOT A LINE OF SYMMETRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
OH BRAVO MATHS MAN 
CLUE THREE 
I HAVE FOUR HOLES I'M MADE OF WOOD 
YOU'LL BE LOCKED IN IF YOU'RE NOT GOOD 
FOUR HOLES WOOD 
LOCKED IN IF YOU'RE NOT GOOD 
OH 
I WONDER IF THEY COULD HELP 
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT IT'S MY DAD 
IT IS QUITE FUNNY JUST A MINUTE 
LOOK FOUR HOLES MADE OF WOOD LOCKED IN 
IT'S THE STOCKS OH AND IT'S SYMMETRICAL 
LOOK IF YOU PUT A LINE RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE BOTH SIDES ARE THE SAME 
WELL NOT QUITE BUT IF I DO THIS 
TA D. A. SYMMETRICAL 
RIGHT I'LL BE OFF NOW BUT WHAT ABOUT MY DAD 
OH YES NEARLY FORGOT 
THERE THANK YOU 
RIGHT 
CONGRATULATIONS MATHS MAN
