FOR MANY YEARS SHE USED TO COMPETE BUT NOW SHE JUST KEEPS IT UP WITH THE TRAINING 
AND THIS IS HER MUM ELAINE WHO REALLY WANTS HER DAUGHTER 
TO FIND HER FEET WITH A NEW NEST AND A NEW LIFE 
SHE KNOWS ANNA IS DESPERATE FOR MORE ROOM TO HOUSE HER EXPANDING SPORTSWEAR BUSINESS 
AND OWEN'S FOOTBALLING ASPIRATIONS 
ANNA YOU'RE A GIRL AFTER MY OWN HEART BIT OF A SPORT BILLY 
GREAT COMBINATION 
THERE YOU ARE DOING ALL THE SPORTY THINGS AND MUM'S A CHIROPODIST

SO YOU'RE AN ACTIVE GIRL WITH A LOVELY THREE YEAR OLD BOY 
WHO I CAN JUST ABOUT HEAR IN THE BACKGROUND YOUNG OWEN 
YES LITTLE OWEN IS THAT WHY YOU WANT TO MOVE MY MAIN REASON WAS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A GARDEN 
AND NOT EVEN AN AREA THAT'S SAFE 
THE GARDEN'S LIKE THAT AND TOO DANGEROUS FOR A CHILD TO PLAY IN 
AND SHE NEEDS SPACE FOR HER BUSINESS AS WELL O. K. SO TELL US ABOUT THAT 
O. K. I LIVED IN GREECE FOR A FEW YEARS 
AND NOTICED A LINE OF SPORTSWEAR IN GREECE THAT WE COULDN'T GET HERE 
SO I WENT OVER THERE AND MADE AN EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT WITH THEM TO SELL IT HERE IN THE U. K. FOR THEM 
SO RUNNING A BUSINESS FROM HOME YOU NEED ROOM FOR THAT TOO DEFINITELY WE NEED A ROOM OR SPACE 
WHERE I CAN HAVE MY OFFICE AND MAYBE THE STOCK 
SO JUST GIVE US AN IDEA OF ACTUAL TOWNS OR PLACES YOU WANT TO BE 
I HAVE THE MAP I WOULD LOVE TO LIVE AROUND ABOUT HERE 
HERE HERE AND HERE 
THAT'S RIGHT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT DOWNLEY MAYBE LOUDWATER INTO MARLOW 
ALL QUITE DESIRABLE AREAS HOW MANY BEDROOMS 
I'VE GOT THREE AT THE MOMENT AND IT'S PERFECT BUT NOT NECESSARILY THREE IT COULD BE TWO 
DEPENDING ON THE SPACE DOWNSTAIRS THE OFFICE SPACE BASICALLY IN A PERFECT WORLD WHAT KIND OF HOUSE 
SEMI DETACHED DEFINITELY A SEMI DETACHED THREE OR TWO BEDROOMS 
AND LOTS OF SPACE 
WHAT ABOUT FOR YOU HOW DO YOU LIKE TO RELAX 
WHEN I NEED TO RELAX THE BATH IS MY SANCTUARY PUT THE CANDLES ON 
AND FORGET I'M IN THE HOUSE BASICALLY AND JUST MELT AWAY 
AND OF COURSE THE ALL IMPORTANT QUESTION WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET 
YEAH O. K. THE BUDGET IS THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD THAT FACE 
HANG ON THE BUDGET IS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
ANYWAY NO COME ON WHAT'S THE BUDGET 
IF YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE THIS TASK O. K. IT IS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE IT'S TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YEAH 
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO ALL HAVE TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER HERE 
AND YOU MIGHT HAVE TO COMPROMISE A BIT THIS AREA IS 
THAT'S WHY I CALLED YOU GUYS BECAUSE I NEED A HAND 
WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF PAIRS OF BOXING GLOVES

KEEP YOUR KNEES UP JENNY KNEES UP

WELL I'M IAN NOT PAUL DANIELS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO FIND FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
DON'T BE SO NEGATIVE THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU IAN 
LISTEN WE SAID COMPROMISE WE MEANT IT 
YOU BETCHA RIGHT THREE BEDROOMS 
PROBABLY TWO MAYBE ONE 
SEMI DETACHED PROBABLY TERRACED 
SHE WANTS A ROOF MAYBE NO ROOF 
WITH A FEW COMPROMISES WE'LL SUIT THAT BUDGET 
AND ANYWAY WE'RE GOOD AT THINKING ON OUR FEET 
I'M VERY GOOD AT PUTTING MY FOOT IN IT YOU GET IT 
I'LL GO AND SEE THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THE AREA THEN 
HA I JUST GOT IT AND I'LL CHAT TO THE ESTATE AGENTS 
BUT BEFORE THAT JUST ONE MORE THING LEFT TO DO 
HELLO ELAINE IT'S IAN 
HELLO 
DON'T TELL IAN BUT IS THERE ANY CHANCE OF YOU BOOKING ME IN FOR A QUICK SESSION WITH THE OLD FEET 
OH I'M REALLY SORRY I'VE JUST BOOKED MY LAST APPOINTMENT SORRY 
OH MOVING ON SEE YOU LATER BYE 
AND WHILE WE GO AND FIND THREE PROPERTIES 
HERE'S WHAT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CAN GET YOU ROUND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
FIRST UP ANGLESEY IN NORTH WALES 
IT WOULD GET YOU THIS DETACHED VICTORIAN PAD 
WITH FOUR DOUBLE BEDROOMS A SPACIOUS KITCHEN 
AND LARGE LIVING AREA 
OR ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT THERE'S THIS THREE BEDROOMED DETACHED HOUSE WITH MODERN KITCHEN 
CONSERVATORY AND FANTASTIC GARDEN AGAIN BANG ON THE MONEY AT TWO TWENTY FIVE K. 
YEAH THAT'S QUITE NICE 
UNTIL YOU SEE THIS TWO BEDROOMED COTTAGE IN INGMIRE HALL IN CUMBRIA 
BE THE KING OR QUEEN OF THE CASTLE IN FOUR ACRES OF COMMUNAL GROUNDS 
DATING RIGHT BACK TO THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY 
A RATHER GRAND OLD GAFF FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
ALL VERY TEMPTING BUT WHAT SORT OF BOUNTY HAS BUCKINGHAMSHIRE GOT TO OFFER US 
IN TERMS OF NATURAL BEAUTY WE'RE IN GOOD COMPANY 
THE ROLLING CHILTERNS TRANQUIL SURROUNDINGS AND LIVELY TOWNS 
HAVE ATTRACTED THE LIKES OF ROALD DAHL DUSTY SPRINGFIELD AND TERRY WOGAN 
WHO'VE ALL USED THEIR BUCKS TO BUY IN BUCKS 
SO FOR PROPERTY THIS IS A VERITABLE HOT SPOT WITH EVERYONE CLAMOURING 
TO STAKE THEIR SLICE OF THE COUNTRY IDYLL 
BUT WITH LONDON JUST A STONE'S THROW AWAY THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A SEMI IS TWENTY PER CENT HIGHER 
THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY ANNA WANTS TO LIVE HERE BUT HAS SHE BUDGETED FOR BUCKINGHAMSHIRE 
NOTHING AT ALL NOT EVEN NEAR THAT 
HOW ABOUT IF I SACRIFICE A BEDROOM AND GO TWO BEDROOMS 
HI I'VE GOT A BIT OF A CHALLENGE FOR YOU 
I DIDN'T THINK IT'D BE THIS TOUGH THREE BEDROOMED PROPERTY 
SEMI DETACHED 
O. K. CAN'T BE LATE FOR MY APPOINTMENT 
THIS IS THE CRUX 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
RIGHT THREE BEDROOMS THREE BEDROOMS YES 
THAT MIGHT LIMIT US A LITTLE BIT 
WHAT IS THE MAIN PROBLEM WELL THEY JUST HURT 
I HAVE TO WALK A LOT LOOKING FOR HOUSES 
THERE'S ONE HERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF HIGH WYCOMBE IN DOWNLEY A NICE SORT OF COURTYARD DEVELOPMENT 
THAT LOOKS NICE 
BEST YOU AND I JUST KEEP THIS BETWEEN OURSELVES TO BE HONEST 
SO AS COMPROMISES GO THIS IS A GOOD ONE THAT IS THE ONE 
I BET THEY GO QUICKLY A LOT OF CHARACTER LIKELY TO GO QUICKLY 
O. K. I'D BETTER GET ON IT 
I'LL JUST DO YOUR NAILS HAVE YOU CUT THEM RECENTLY 
I WONDER IF IAN'S HAVING BETTER LUCK THAN ME 
OH OH 
AHH 
BETTER JUST NOT SAY ANYTHING FOR A MINUTE 
HELLO YOU ALL RIGHT HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON 
I'M RUSHED OFF MY FEET TO BE HONEST 
ME TOO MY FEET ARE ABSOLUTELY KILLING ME 
HAVE YOU HAD ANY RESULTS 
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FOUND ANYTHING YET I'M DOING PREP AT THE MOMENT 
I'VE GOT QUITE A FEW IN MY HAND LOADS ACTUALLY 
I'VE GOT TO FOLLOW UP ON SOME LEADS 
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD GET THE BUS I CAN'T WALK ANY MORE WELL IF IT WAS ME I'D WALK 
FINE I'LL KEEP GOING THEN 
O. K. I THINK I'LL HEAD EAST 
ALL RIGHT CHEERS BYE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
I AM ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTED ARE YOU MY FEET ARE KILLING ME 
I'VE GOT A SPRING IN MY STEP TO BE HONEST HAVE YOU 
IT WAS AS TOUGH AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE MY SHOES OFF NO TRUDGING AROUND EVERYWHERE 
I MANAGED TO GET A FEW PROPERTIES BUT OH THAT'S BETTER I GOT ONE 
LOOK AT THIS GREAT PROPERTY 
SHE ASKED FOR DOWNLEY I GOT HER DOWNLEY COMPROMISE FORGET IT

THANKS SO MUCH SO THAT'S IT WE'VE GOT THREE PROPERTIES 
SHALL WE START THE VIEWINGS WITH PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
YES LET'S IT'S MY CHOICE 
A TWO BEDROOMED VICTORIAN TERRACE IN THE POPULAR VILLAGE OF LOUDWATER 
IT'S NICELY DECORATED AND I THINK ANNA'S GOING TO GET A REAL KICK OUT OF THIS ONE 
ANNA AND ELAINE COME AND TAKE A STROLL THROUGH WHAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE YOUR NEW FRONT GARDEN 
I'VE BROUGHT YOU TO LOUDWATER ONE OF THE AREAS YOU WANTED TO BE 
HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THAT 
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED ALREADY THAT IT'S NOT EXACTLY END OF TERRACE IT'S A MID TERRACE 
YOU WANTED THREE BEDROOMS WELL I'VE KIND OF GOT YOU TWO 
BUT CRITICALLY GOT YOU THE LOCATION AND A BACK GARDEN AS WELL RIGHT 
WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS I'LL GO WITH MUM FIRST 
WELL IT'S AN ATTRACTIVE LITTLE HOUSE 
QUITE A PRACTICAL CHOICE 
YEAH FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
IT'S A MID TERRACE WHAT CAN I SAY 
THERE IS SIDE ACCESS YEAH O. K. 
GET INSIDE THERE HAVE A LITTLE LOOK AROUND JENNY AND I WILL LOITER SUSPICIOUSLY OUTSIDE 
WE'LL SEE YOU WHEN YOU COME OUT O. K. THANK YOU 
I'M HELPING YOU OUT ON THIS ONE CONSIDERING YOU'VE CHOSEN SUCH A QUIET LOCATION 
WHAT EXACTLY 
SO WILL YOUR PROPERTY BE A KNOCKOUT FOR THE GIRLS 
YEAH IT'S GONNA BE KICKIN' 
WHAT A LOVELY ROOM LOOK AT THIS YEAH THIS IS LOVELY 
GOOD VISUAL IMPACT WHEN YOU WALK IN THIS HOUSE 
YEAH I CAN JUST SEE OWEN DANCING RUNNING UP AND DOWN 
WHEN YOU SPIN ON YOUR HEAD IS IT BEST TO HAVE SOMETHING ON IT 
A BASEBALL CAP IN HINDSIGHT YEAH LOOK AT ME 
I LIKE THE FIRE TOO VERY MODERN 
YEAH IT'S A BIGGER ROOM THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEING AS IT'S AT THE FRONT 
AND THE FRONT DOOR DOESN'T ACTUALLY OPEN UP WHICH I WORRY ABOUT ONTO THE FRONT ROOM 
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE PORCH THAT'S REALLY GOOD 
OH LOOK THEY'VE EVEN GOT A LITTLE OFFICE BIT HERE 
IT'S QUITE A NICE SPACE THE ONLY THING THAT WORRIES ME 
IS THE STAIRCASE IS OPEN FOR A CHILD TO FALL OVER THE EDGE 
THE WISE WORDS OF GRANDMA THERE SHE'S RIGHT 
OH WHAT A NICE KITCHEN YEAH THIS IS NEAR ENOUGH BRAND NEW ISN'T IT 
YES THAT WON'T NEED RE DOING IN A HURRY 
IT IS A NICE KITCHEN THE KITCHEN'S THE ONE THING I'D UPDATE 
TO BRING IT IN LINE WITH THE REST OF THE HOUSE BUT IF THEY'RE HAPPY WITH IT 
AND LOOK THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME OVEN AND HOB AS I'VE GOT 
I HOPE THEY'RE IMPRESSED WITH THE ROOMS UPSTAIRS YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS ISN'T MY PROPERTY 
OH THIS IS FABULOUS 
I LIKE THE COLOUR SCHEME I WOULD NOT CHANGE IT 
HE'S DONE VERY WELL 
OH YEAH HE'S DONE VERY WELL 
AND LISTEN 
THERE'S NO TRAFFIC SOUND NO 
IT'S ALL DOUBLE GLAZED QUIET INSIDE THIS HOUSE WISH I WAS IN THERE 
OH THIS IS A NICE LITTLE ROOM IDEAL FOR OWEN ISN'T IT 
IT'S QUITE SWEET REALLY ISN'T IT YEAH 
IT'S QUITE THIN AND NARROW PERFECT FOR OWEN 
WHEN I WALKED IN HERE EVERYTHING WAS FAB AND GORGEOUS 
AND REALLY SMACKED ME IN THE FACE 
REALLY NICE PERFECT 
BUT BUT BUT 
I DID WONDER IF THE GARDEN WOULD LET ME DOWN A BIT 
IT HAS 
OH MY GOODNESS YES THIS IS QUITE A SIZE 
IT'S NICE YEAH YEAH 
IT'S BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 
PROS AND CONS 
PROS CONS 
DO YOU THINK I COULD LIE FULL LENGTH IN THIS BATH I THINK YOU COULD LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF OLD BATHS THEY'RE LONGER 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON YOU CAN HAVE CANDLES ROUND LOW MUSIC YOU CAN RELAX 
YOU CAN BRING ME TEA AND COFFEE YOUR JOSS STICKS 
SHE SOUNDS HAPPY AND SHE SOUNDS PLEASED WITH THIS PROPERTY 
ACTUALLY IT TICKS ALL THE BOXES 
DEFINITELY I'D WORRY ABOUT THE GARDEN 
ALL I'D SAY TO THAT REALLY IS WORRY NOT BECAUSE WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY 
YOU LIKED THE HOUSE WE HEARD THAT YEAH THE ONLY CONCERN WAS THE GARDEN 
IT'S VERY LUMPY BUMPY AND IT'S SLOPED 
TWO THINGS I WOULD SAY FIRST THESE FENCE PANELS VERY DARK 
LGHTENING THEM UP WILL ALREADY PUSH THEM THAT WAY 
THESE BUSHES CUT THEM BACK GIVE OWEN SOME ROOM 
IT IS LUMPY AND IT IS BUMPY 
AND IT IS SLIGHTLY SLOPING 
I THINK THERE ARE WAYS AROUND THAT 
TAKE ALL THE EARTH UP THAT END AND BRING IT DOWN THIS END 
BY DOING THAT OWEN CAN THEN HAVE HIS LITTLE PLAY AREA UP HERE 
TERRACED PATIO JUST DOWN HERE 
ALL GOING TO COST A BIT OF MONEY 
BUT I THINK THE MONEY WOULD BE WELL SPENT IN HERE BECAUSE IT'S ONLY THE GARDEN THAT NEEDS SORTING 
LET THE GAMES BEGIN IT'S GUESS THE PRICE GUESS TO BE HAD 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST ANNA MAYBE 
ER YES I'D SAY I'D GUESS AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN MAX 
ALL RIGHT I WOULD SAY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TEN 
TWO HUNDRED TEN SHE'S ONLY FIFTY QUID OUT 
OH OH TWO HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THERE YOU GO WELL FANCY THAT SO ALL GOOD STUFF FOR YOU REALLY 
BEFORE YOUR MUM GETS TOO COMPETITIVE AND THINGS KICK OFF 
LET'S HOT FOOT IT TO MY PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
MY OFFERING OF THE DAY HOUSE TWO AND IT'S A SEMI NOT A TERRACE 
I'VE FOUND THIS LITTLE BEAUTY I'M DELIVERING NOT ONE 
NOT TWO BUT THREE BEDROOMS AND A STUNNING VIEW IN DOWNLEY 
WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT COMPROMISING 
SO ANNA ELAINE WELCOME TO PROPERTY NUMBER TWO MY CHOICE 
AND HERE WE ARE IN DOWNLEY ON THE EDGE OF THE CHILTERNS 
YOU'VE GOT A GORGEOUS VIEW THERE WHICH YOU CAN SOAK UP LATER 
JUST TO REMIND YOU WE WERE TALKING ABOUT COMPROMISE FOR YOUR BUDGET 
AND IAN'S PROPERTY REFLECTED THAT A TAD HERE I'VE DELIVERED THE GOODS FOR YOU 
THREE BEDROOMS SEMI DETACHED A GREAT GARDEN BEFORE SHE BOILS OVER 
DESPITE WHAT SHE SAYS SHE'S COMPROMISED 
O. K. THE AREA THAT WE'RE IN NOW IS JUST NOT QUITE AS SALUBRIOUS MUM WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WELL WHEN WE CAME DOWN THE ROAD IT SEEMED VERY QUIET AND PEACEFUL LOOKS VERY NICE 
WHAT DOES IT DO FOR YOU THEN CAN'T WAIT TO GET IN AND HAVE A LOOK 
O. K. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU SHOULD DO WE'LL BE OUTSIDE LISTENING FEEL FREE 
AND MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME 
RIGHT SEE YOU LATER 
WELL WELL WHAT 
I THINK WE MIGHT AS WELL GO HOME NOW JOB DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I WISH YOU WOULD GO HOME I REALLY DO NOW 
O. K. THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE THIS IS NICE YEAH 
SECONDS AWAY ROUND TWO 
THE HALLWAY WHICH IS NICE 
PUT YOUR SHOES AND COAT 
AND BANNISTERS THIS TIME YES NICE AND SAFE 
ELAINE'S PLEASED ABOUT THAT SAFETY FIRST ESPECIALLY WITH A GORGEOUS GRANDSON 
THIS IS A NICE BIG ROOM DO YOU THINK THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE SIZE OF MY ROOM 
IT LOOKS BIGGER 
YEAH I THINK IT MIGHT BE 
OH ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE A NICE VIEW ISN'T IT OH YES 
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE WAY OVER WYCOMBE 
AND THERE'S A GARDEN SO OWEN CAN PLAY WITH ALL HIS MATES SAFELY 
AS A KEEP FIT FANATIC THAT CAN STAY 
NO YOU CAN'T HAVE THE BIKE WITH THE HOUSE 
IT'S QUITE DECEIVING YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG KITCHEN AND IT'S NICE AND SQUARE 
I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT JENNY'S GONE FOR A SEVENTIES HOUSE 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY DO LACK CHARACTER 
THERE'S A HATCH TO PUT THE FOOD THROUGH TO THE DINING ROOM 
I LOVE MY HATCH YOU KNOW I LOVE MY HATCH 
ANYWAY TALKING OF THE SEVENTIES WHO IS IT SITTING HERE THAT'S WEARING A VELVET JACKET 
OH THIS IS A NICE SIZE 
IT IS ISN'T IT FOR OWEN IT'S A LOVELY SIZE 
I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT WALL IT'S LOVELY 
WHY COLLECT DEAD BUGS AND PUT THEM ON THE WALL I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT WOULD REALLY BUG ME 
I TELL YOU WHAT THOUGH 
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO RE DECORATE THIS IT'S BLUE HE'S A BOY AND HE LOVES ABSOLUTELY LOVES DOLPHINS 
HE'D MOVE STRAIGHT IN THERE 
NO PROBLEM ABSOLUTELY HE LOVES THINGS LIKE THAT 
SO LET'S TRY THIS ROOM NEXT 
THIS IS A BIG ROOM ISN'T IT 
YEAH I DON'T LIKE THE WALLPAPER SO THAT WOULD DEFINITELY GO 
THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO BE DONE 
I SUSPECT IF ANNA BOUGHT THIS HOUSE THERE'S NO WAY SHE WOULD DO ONE ROOM AT A TIME ALL CALMLY 
SHE'D RIP THE WALLPAPER OFF ALL THE ROOMS 
IT DOESN'T SEEM IF I GOT THESE LAYERS OF WALLPAPER OFF THAT THERE IS MUCH OR ANY PROBLEMS 
THINKING ABOUT THE WALLPAPER IN THIS HOUSE 
THINK ABOUT A LADY WHO WEARS MAKE UP AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THAT MAKEUP 
OH MY GOODNESS ME AND AGAIN THIS IS A WONDERFUL SIZE TOO ISN'T IT 
YEAH LOOK OFFICE SPACE BED SPACE 
MIND YOU I WOULDN'T WANT TO WORK IN MY BEDROOM NO BUT IT'S IDEAL IF YOU WANTED SOMEBODY TO STAY 
LISTEN YOU CAN TWEAK IT A BIT 
YOU'RE LIKING ANNA COME ON WORK WITH ME 
MY GOODNESS LOOK WHAT'S THAT 
IT'S GOT SOMETHING IN IT OH NO THEY'VE FOUND THAT BIG ANIMAL IN THAT GLASS THING 
I THINK THERE'S AN IGUANA IN THERE 
IT'S NICE BUT SMALL COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE ROOMS IN THE HOUSE 
YOU'D EXPECT IT TO HAVE A BIGGER BATHROOM 
YOUR ROUND VERY GOOD 
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY YOU GET THE BEERS 
YES WELL DONE THAT GIRL IS IT WELL DESERVED 
ABSOLUTELY YEAH 
SO I'VE REALLY DELIVERED EVERYTHING YOU'VE ASKED FOR BUT IT DOESN'T END THERE 
BECAUSE THE WHOLE REASON YOU WANT TO MOVE IS TO HAVE A GARDEN FOR OWEN 
LIKE THE GARDEN BUT EVEN BETTER YOU'VE GOT SIDE ACCESS 
SO WHEN HE COMES IN WITH HIS FRIENDS WITH ALL THEIR MUDDY SHOES 
THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE HOUSE THEY CAN SHOOT DOWN THE SIDE INTO THE GARDEN AND PLAY 
JUST WHAT I WANTED AS YOU WATCH FROM THE KITCHEN 
EVEN MORE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THIS COULD BE A GREAT INVESTMENT PROPERTY 
BECAUSE YOU CAN GET PLANNING PERMISSION TO DO A DOUBLE STOREY EXTENSION IF YOU SO WISH 
SO LATER IN LIFE YOU MIGHT HAVE FREED UP CASH 
FROM THAT VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS YOU'VE STARTED UP 
AND ONE PERSON MAKES US SMILE 
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS ARE YOU HAPPY WITH JENNY'S CHOICE OR ARE YOU HOPPING MAD 
I HAVEN'T DONE THAT FOR A FEW YEARS 
DEEP BREATH AND MOVING ON SO 
THAT BUDGET TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
YOU WERE TRIUMPHANT FIRST TIME ROUND ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT AGAIN 
WELL I THINK PROBABLY THIS IS GOING TO BE QUITE A BIT MORE THAN THE OTHER PROPERTY 
AND I THINK IT'LL PROBABLY BE MORE LIKE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE 
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING FOR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE O. K. 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MAX 
QUITE A BIG DIFFERENCE THERE BETWEEN MOTHER AND DAUGHTER 
I CAN REVEAL THAT THE ASKING PRICE IS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WHICH MEANS CLOSE CALL BUT YOU'VE DONE IT LET'S GO SEE THE WILD CARD 
OUR FINAL OPTION FOR ANNA TODAY IS THE WILD CARD FOR WHICH WE'RE 
TAKING HER AND HER MUM TO THE PRETTY VILLAGE OF PIDDINGTON 
THIS TWO BEDROOM VICTORIAN TERRACE WAS ONCE A POST OFFICE 
IT'S GOT BAGS OF CHARACTER TWO GREAT SIZED ROOMS DOWNSTAIRS 
WITH AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND WOOD BURNING STOVE 
WHAT MORE COULD OUR ACTION GIRL WISH FOR 
WHY IS IT WILD YOU ASK WE'LL TELL YOU 
WE WERE LISTENING TO YOUR SHOPPING LIST AND ONE OF YOUR LOCATIONS WAS WEST WYCOMBE 
WE'RE NOT IN WEST WYCOMBE SO WE'VE KIND OF COMPROMISED 
WE'RE ONLY A MILE AWAY IN A LOVELY PLACE CALLED PIDDINGTON 
THERE'S ANOTHER THING SLIGHTLY WILD IT'S KIND OF A HOUSE BUT IT USED TO BE A POST OFFICE AS WELL 
BUT FOR ME THAT SAYS IT ALL 
YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS PLACE FOR LOCATION 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS IT'S VERY QUAINT 
I LIKE IT AND I LOVE THE NAME 
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO YOU'RE PROBABLY QUITE KEEN TO GET INSIDE AND HAVE A LITTLE LOOK 
AND AS A POST OFFICE LET'S HOPE THIS IS FIRST CLASS 
QUICK RUN BEFORE SHE TELLS ANOTHER ONE 
TALKING OF WHICH WE DIDN'T TELL THEM NOBODY LIVES IN THIS HOUSE 
THAT MEANS THEY CAN PUT THEIR OWN STAMP ON IT GET IT 
WOW NICE FIREPLACE 
AH IT'S A WORKING FIREPLACE 
LOVELY HAVE AN OPEN FIRE IT'D BE GREAT WOULDN'T IT 
THERE ARE TWO WORKING FIREPLACES IN THIS HOUSE 
THAT'S REALLY COTTAGEY ISN'T IT THAT EFFECT WITH THE ALCOVES 
IT'S A BIT BARE ISN'T IT SO 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO VISUALISE WHEN IT'S EMPTY 
NOTHING TO CLOUD THE VIEW I'D PROBABLY HAVE TO REPLACE THAT DOOR BUT I'M PROBABLY 
GONNA REPLACE IT WITH A RED ONE COS I LIKE THE WHOLE FEATURE OF THE FACT IT'S AN OLD POST OFFICE 
ACTUALLY MY MUM AND DAD LIVE IN AN OLD POST OFFICE AND SHE'S ONLY GONE AND PAINTED THE DOOR GREEN 
OH YES 
NOW THIS IS A SURPRISE 
COMING IN THERE YOU THINK OH GOSH IT'S GONNA BE EVEN SMALLER BEHIND 
YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO STOP AND BE A KITCHEN OR SOMETHING 
IT'S AMAZING IT IS A SURPRISE 
YOU GO TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND IT OPENS RIGHT UP 
THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT YOU'D WANT TO RIP DOWN AND 
GO RIGHT BACK TO THE BARE WHATEVER IS BEHIND THERE 
YEP YOU CAN TAKE THAT AWAY 
THIS COULD BE A REALLY FANTASTIC KITCHEN 
AT THE MINUTE IT'S WORKABLE ISN'T IT 
IT'S GOT THE OVEN AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BUILT IN 
SHE COULD BE IN THE KITCHEN DOING WHATEVER LOOKING AT OWEN PLAYING IN THE GARDEN WITH HIS FRIENDS 
QUITE A NICE LENGTH OF GARDEN 
WHAT A LOVELY VIEW THAT'S IT 
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
THIS IS A SURPRISE BECAUSE IT'S QUITE BIG ISN'T IT 
GET A NICE BIG BED IN HERE 
BLACK CAT BLACK CAT THIS COULD BE OUR LUCKY DAY 
THIS IS A REASONABLE SIZE TOO ISN'T IT YEAH 
YEAH IT IS IT'S NOT BAD AND IT'S PAINTED 
IT'S GOT A LITTLE CUPBOARD 
I THINK THERE'S LESS TO DO UPSTAIRS 
BEDROOM'S MUCH LESS TO DO YES 
FAIR SIZE VERY NICE LOOK OH YES THAT'S A SURPRISE 
COS USUALLY IN COTTAGES THEY'RE QUITE SMALL AREN'T THEY 
IT'S GOT A BEAUTIFUL WINDOW WITH THE SUN SHINING THROUGH AGAIN I CAN LIE IN THE BATH 
FOR YOU TIME YEAH 
IT'S GOT A LOVELY ATMOSPHERE AS YOU WALK IN IT FEELS HOMELY 
IT'S CERTAINLY HOMELY AND IT'S GOT POTENTIAL 
BUT IS THAT ENOUGH TO SWING IT FOR ANNA 
WHAT IS IT WITH THIS HOUSE LOVELY ATMOSPHERE YEAH REALLY HOMEY LOTS OF WORK 
LOTS OF WORK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT 
LET'S GET EXCITED ABOUT THIS 
WOODCHIP DOES COVER UP A MULTITUDE OF SINS 
YES SOME OF IT NEEDS REPLASTERING BUT WHEN YOU TAKE IT OFF THERE'S NOT GONNA BE THE WHOLE WALLS 
THE CEILING IT'S NOT THAT PRETTY IS IT 
NO I DON'T WANT TO MOVE INTO A PLACE THAT NEEDED ALL THE WORK DOING 
COS I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT AROUND MY WORKING DAY 
WE KNOW THE ANSWER THEN DON'T WE 
YOU AND OWEN MOVE INTO YOUR MUM'S HOUSE SHE'S STILL SMILING 
GET A LOVELY BUILDER WE GIVE HIM TWO WEEKS AND IN TWO WEEKS I RECKON YOU CAN GET THE KITCHEN TRANSFORMED 
THE PLASTER PATCHED THE DECORATION DONE HAPPY DAYS YOU AND OWEN OWEN IN THE GARDEN 
THAT ISN'T FAR OFF WHAT WE COULD DO 
YOU LIKE THIS PLACE DON'T YOU 
BUT YOU'RE LOOKING LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE FALLEN IN LOVE 
BUT ALSO YOU'RE A VERY PRACTICAL WOMAN I KNOW YEAH 
WITH PRACTICALITIES YOU HAVE TO INVOLVE HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA COST YOU AND IT'S GUESS THE PRICE 
REMEMBER IT'S ONE ALL SO FAR
