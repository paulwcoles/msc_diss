THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM HOME AND STILL SAY IT'S YOUR FAULT 
YOU'VE TOLD THE PHONE COMPANY THAT YOU WANT TO BE EX DIRECTORY 
SO HOW COME THEY'VE PUT YOUR DETAILS IN THE BOOK 
AND THE ROGUE WHO MAY ONLY DELIVER HALF YOUR KITCHEN 
BUT COULD STILL HELP HIMSELF TO MORE OF YOUR MONEY 
THAT'S WATCHDOG TONIGHT 
WELCOME TO WATCHDOG 
PLANNING A HOLIDAY SOME ADVICE YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD FOR A WHILE 
GET SOME TRAVELLERS' CHEQUES 
THEY MAY SEEM LIKE SOMETHING FROM THE STONE AGE 
BUT THE TROUBLE IS WHEN YOU USE A CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD ABROAD 
YOU COULD FIND THAT YOUR BANK SUDDENLY STOPS IT WORKING 
THEY MAY DO IT WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS BUT FOR SOME OF YOU 
IT MEANS YOU'RE STUCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD WITHOUT CASH 
I DON'T SEE HOW THEY CAN JUSTIFY LEAVING PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION 
OSTENSIBLY STRANDED ABROAD WITH NO MEANS OF PAYMENT 
THEY REALLY COULDN'T CARE LESS 
WE HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO TOLD ONE OF THE U. K.'S BIGGEST PHONE COMPANIES 
THEY WANT TO BE EX DIRECTORY 
THEY DIDN'T WANT CERTAIN PEOPLE TO KNOW WHERE THEY LIVED 
EVEN SO ALL OF THEIR DETAILS WERE STILL PUT IN THE PHONE BOOK 
AND WE TRY TO HELP A GROUP OF GIRL GUIDES 
THEY WAITED A YEAR FOR THE SPORTS EQUIPMENT SAINSBURY'S HAD PROMISED 
YOU CAN TEXT US ABOUT ANY OF OUR STORIES FOR THE PRICE OF A TEXT 
YOU CAN E. MAIL OR CALL US WE READ THEM OUT AT THE END OF THE SHOW 
A ROGUE WHO CAN'T STAND THE HEAT GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN BUSINESS 
HERE'S ONE WHO TELLS HIS CUSTOMERS HE'S DONE JUST THAT IT'S A LIE 
WE'RE ON THE TRAIL OF ONE MAN 
THE KITCHEN COMPANY BOSS WHO'S BEEN COOKING UP MISERY FOR HIS CUSTOMERS 
HE'S BEHIND A BUSINESS CALLED THE KITCHEN SURGERY 
CATCHY MOTTO HALF THE HASSLE HALF THE TIME HALF THE COST 
A LITTLE BIT HALF BAKED BECAUSE THEY'VE LEFT 
SOME OF THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH HALF A KITCHEN AND OTHERS 
WITH NO KITCHEN AT ALL 
THEY'VE TAKEN CASH UPFRONT FROM CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE SOUTH EAST 
WELCOME TO THE KITCHEN SURGERY A KITCHEN MAKEOVER COMPANY 
BUT DAN WAKEMAN FEELS HIS KITCHEN 
HASN'T BEEN MADE OVER IT'S BEEN DONE OVER 
HE SPENT TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ON A KITCHEN SURGERY MAKEOVER LAST DECEMBER 
AND ALL HE'S GOT ARE THESE CUPBOARD DOORS 
I FEEL VERY ANGRY AT THE WAY I WAS TREATED 
WE KEPT LEAVING ANSWER MACHINE MESSAGES NOBODY EVER CONTACTED US 
DAN IS NOW TAKING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE KITCHEN SURGERY 
I FEEL EXHAUSTED 
I STILL DON'T HAVE A KITCHEN IT'S JUST HEARTBREAKING REALLY 
LEE HOWARD WAS A SURVEYOR FOR THE KITCHEN SURGERY UNTIL LAST DECEMBER 
HE SAYS DAN'S IS A FAMILIAR STORY 
THE BOSS'S PHONES WERE CONSTANTLY GOING WITH COMPLAINTS 
THE FIT DATES HAD GONE PAST AND THE KITCHENS HADN'T EVEN BEEN ORDERED 
LEE CLAIMS HE'S OWED THOUSANDS OF POUNDS BY THE KITCHEN SURGERY 
HE BLAMES THE BOSS'S RECKLESS ATTITUDE 
THE COMPANY BUILT UP MASSIVE DEBTS 
SO THE MANUFACTURERS THAT THEY WERE USING HADN'T BEEN PAID 
THAT MEANT ORDERS COULDN'T BE FULFILLED 
THIS IS THE ESTATE IN LUTON WHERE THEY USED TO OPERATE 
WE'VE BEEN TOLD THEY LEFT A FEW WEEKS AGO THE SAME TIME 
THEY LEFT MANY CUSTOMERS THOUSANDS OF POUNDS WORSE OFF 
SO WHO'S THE MAN RESPONSIBLE 
WELL HIS C. V. READS LIKE THE RECIPE FOR A CAREER CONMAN 
HIS NAME 
PAUL MARTIN 
MR. MARTIN WAS SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON 
FOR FRAUDULENT TRADING IN TWO THOUSAND ONE AND BANNED 
FROM BEING A COMPANY DIRECTOR 
HE PLEADED GUILTY TO NINE CHARGES 
OF BREAKING THE TRADES DESCRIPTIONS ACT 
HE SET UP THE KITCHEN SURGERY 
AND WE ALL KNOW THE BITTER AFTERTASTE THAT LEFT CUSTOMERS WITH 
THIS PILE OF WOOD IS ALL STUART CARDOW RECEIVED 
AFTER PAYING A THREE THOUSAND DEPOSIT FOR HIS KITCHEN LAST OCTOBER 
THEY WEREN'T ENTITLED TO ANY MORE MONEY UNTIL IT WAS ALL DELIVERED 
BUT THEY HELPED THEMSELVES TO TWO THOUSAND FROM STUART'S CREDIT CARD 
THE KITCHEN HAS COME IN BITS 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT ALL OF IT WE'RE SITTING IN THE SHELL OF A ROOM 
AND THEN THE KICK IN THE TEETH YOU FIND OUT THAT MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND 
HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM YOUR CREDIT CARD 
THAT'S CORRECT 
GUTTED LITERALLY 
SOMEONE HAD JUST STOLEN MONEY OUT OF MY ACCOUNT 
STUART TRIED TO GET THE MONEY BACK FROM HIS CREDIT CARD COMPANY 
BUT INCREDIBLY MARTIN TOLD THEM THEY'D HAD THEIR KITCHEN INSTALLED 
THIS KITCHEN LOOKS NEITHER DELIVERED NOR INSTALLED 
HE'S LIED TO YOU 
AND HE IS LYING TO HIS OWN BANK AND TO MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY 
IT'S LIE AFTER LIE AFTER LIE 
HOW HAVE THINGS BEEN FOR YOU IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING 
WE'VE FIVE ADULTS AND A SIX WEEK OLD BABY 
WE'VE GOT A MICROWAVE AND A LITTLE CAMPING STOVE WE'VE GOT TO COOK OFF 
THIS IS OUR WONDERFUL NEW FITTED SINK 
ONE OF THE NEWER VERSIONS KITCHEN SURGERY SPECIAL 
TO PAUL MARTIN IT'S A FITTED KITCHEN 
STUART SPENT MONTHS TRYING TO GET THE REST OF HIS KITCHEN DELIVERED 
BUT HE'S NOW GIVEN UP HOPE 
ESPECIALLY AFTER THIS MESSAGE FROM MR. MARTIN IN EARLY FEBRUARY 
HE SAID STUART'S MISSING ITEMS 
WERE BEING STORED AT ANOTHER COMPANY 
BUT HIS PHONE CALLS AND MESSAGES TO THE COMPANY HAVEN'T BEEN RETURNED 
MARTIN MAY TELL THE CUSTOMERS HE'S LET DOWN THAT THE KITCHEN SURGERY 
IS NO LONGER IN BUSINESS 
BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY WHEN THERE'S MORE MONEY TO BE MADE 
AND WHEN WE SPOKE TO HIM IT WAS QUITE CLEAR HE'S STILL AT IT 
THREE WEEKS AGO WE ASKED FOR A QUOTE FOR OUR KITCHEN 
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE INVITE WAS FROM WATCHDOG OF COURSE 
WE GOT A CALL FROM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COMPANY E. P. C. KITCHENS 
THE SALESMAN CAME ROUND CLEARLY THEY'RE THE SAME OUTFIT 
ON THE PAPERWORK NO DOUBT ABOUT THE LINK 
THE KITCHEN SURGERY WAS WRITTEN ALL OVER IT 
SO IS PAUL MARTIN STILL PLAYING THE SAME GAME 
THE SALESMAN CLAIMS GO WITH PAUL AND YOU AVOID THE COWBOYS 
HE'S THE ONLY PERSON WE'VE SPOKEN TO WHO THINKS SO 
AND WITH SO MANY PEOPLE TELLING US COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE 
TIME TO SPEAK TO MARTIN OURSELVES 
WE TRACKED HIM DOWN TO THIS PLUSH COUNTRY PILE IN BEDFORDSHIRE 
THE LADY AT THE DOOR GAVE US HIS CONTACT DETAILS IN SUNNY SPAIN 
HELLO PAUL MARTIN 
IT'S NICKY CAMPBELL FROM WATCHDOG HERE 
NICKY CAMPBELL FROM WATCHDOG HERE 
WE WERE WONDERING ABOUT THE PEOPLE YOU OWE MONEY TO 
FROM THE KITCHEN SURGERY 
THE CALL WAS CUT OFF SO WE LEFT HIM A MESSAGE AND HE CALLED US BACK 
HE'S STILL CLAIMING HE DOESN'T SELL KITCHENS ANY MORE 
RIGHT ARE YOU NOT SELLING KITCHENS ANY MORE 
O. K. AND ARE YOU NO LONGER SELLING KITCHENS 
OH HE'S HUNG UP 
WELL HE'S BEEN BANNED FROM BEING A COMPANY DIRECTOR 
THE AUTHORITIES HAVE PUT HIM IN PRISON 
BUT WHATEVER HE SAYS NOTHING SEEMS TO STOP PAUL MARTIN 
AND MAKE SURE HE IS NOT BEHIND ANY COMPANY THAT YOU CALL IN 
BECAUSE YOU MAY WELL FIND THAT THERE IS A RAT IN THE KITCHEN 
AND HE'S ONLY AFTER YOUR MONEY 
SINCE THAT PHONE CALL WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM PAUL MARTIN 
BUT HIS BUSINESS IS NOW THE SUBJECT OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 
IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THAT THIS KITCHEN SURGERY 
WAS BASED IN THE SOUTH EAST 
AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OTHER COMPANY WITH A SIMILAR NAME 
THANKS FOR YOUR E. MAILS AND LETTERS 
PLENTY ABOUT THE NATIONAL HOUSEBUILDER COUNCIL'S GUARANTEE 
AND MORE MIX UPS BY THE CRIMINAL RECORDS BUREAU 
JAMES TIERNEY SAYS HE LOST HIS JOB AS A HOSPITAL PORTER 
A CHECK ON HIS RECORD CAME BACK WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S CONVICTION 
MICHAEL JACOBS WAS TURNED DOWN FOR A JOB 
HE WAS MUDDLED UP WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAD THIRTEEN CONVICTIONS 
THE CRIMINAL RECORDS BUREAU ACCEPT THEIR MISTAKE 
THOUGH JAMES WILL HAVE TO BE FINGERPRINTED TO CLEAR HIS NAME 
THEY'VE TOLD US THEY EXCEED PERFORMANCE TARGETS 
BUT UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT WHEN THEY GET IT WRONG 
WE STILL GET E. MAILS ABOUT THAT FAULT WITH THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER 
ON SOME MODELS OF THE FORD FOCUS 
KEEP THEM COMING IN ESPECIALLY IF AFTER WHAT FORD TOLD US 
YOU HAVE TROUBLE GETTING IT FIXED 
NEXT A SCHEME THAT'S PROVIDED MILLIONS OF POUNDS' 
OF SPORTS EQUIPMENT TO CHILDREN ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
BUT THESE GIRL GUIDES HAVE BEEN GETTING A WEE BIT TIRED OF WAITING 
IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE SAINSBURY'S LAUNCHED A VOUCHER SCHEME CALLED ACTIVE KIDS 
FOR EVERY TEN SPENT YOU GET A VOUCHER WHICH YOUR LOCAL SCHOOL 
SCOUTS OR GUIDES CAN EXCHANGE FOR ACTIVITY EQUIPMENT 
JO ARBON LEADER OF THE FREELAND GUIDES THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT IDEA 
WE NEEDED NEW EQUIPMENT ITEMS THAT WE HAVE ARE VERY WORN VERY OLD 
SOME ARE REALLY PAST THEIR BEST 
IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN JO ASKED PARENTS 
TO START COLLECTING THE VOUCHERS FOR THE GUIDES 
WITHIN FOUR MONTHS THEY'D COLLECTED THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
MEANING THEY'D SPENT MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND AT SAINSBURY'S 
I WAS OVERWHELMED BY THE RESPONSE 
THEY CAME IN LEFT RIGHT AND CENTRE 
WE WERE EXCITED ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF GETTING SOME NEW EQUIPMENT 
SO LAST MAY JO PLACED AN ORDER WHICH INCLUDED 
BATS BALLS A RAINBOW CHUTE A TIPPING TARGET AND EVEN A PARACHUTE 
THE CHILDREN WERE VERY EXCITED 
I WANTED TO PLAY WITH THE BOUNCY BALLS 
PROBABLY THE BOUNCY BALLS 
BECAUSE PEOPLE THROW THEM ABOUT AND THEY GET LOST OVER THE HEDGE 
PARACHUTES 
BUT AFTER TWO MONTHS THE KIT STILL HADN'T ARRIVED CRUCIALLY MISSING 
THE VERY EVENT IT WAS ORDERED FOR THE GUIDES' MINI OLYMPIC GAMES 
WE'D ORGANISED IT BASED ON US HAVING THIS WONDERFUL NEW EQUIPMENT 
WHEN YOU SEE THE DISAPPOINTMENT ON THE GIRLS' FACES IT'S HEARTBREAKING 
JO WAS TOLD THERE WAS A MIX UP OVER THE DELIVERY ADDRESS 
AND THE KIT WOULD BE DELIVERED SHORTLY 
BUT BY NOVEMBER STILL NOTHING 
JO CHASED SAINSBURY'S AGAIN 
IN FEBRUARY A PACKAGE DID ARRIVE 
I DROVE HOME OVER THE MOON EXPECTING THIS BOX OF EQUIPMENT 
BUT IT WAS THE BOX INVITING ME TO TAKE PART IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ACTIVE KIDS 
NO EQUIPMENT WHATSOEVER 
I WAS GUTTED 
DESPITE MORE PROMISES ALMOST A YEAR AFTER PLACING THEIR ORDER 
THE GUIDES HAVEN'T RECEIVED AS MUCH AS A SKIPPING ROPE 
I'M SO INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH SAINSBURY'S 
I REALLY THOUGHT THEY'D BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR PROMISES 
I FEEL SAD BECAUSE THE PARACHUTE HASN'T ARRIVED 
WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR IT SO WE SHOULD GET SENT IT REALLY 
THE EQUIPMENT HERE IS VERY OLD AND THEY'RE DESPERATE FOR NEW STUFF 
AND IT HASN'T COME 
ACTIVE KIDS IS A GREAT IDEA SAINSBURY'S 
BUT IT'S TIME TO DELIVER BECAUSE THE CHILDREN HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU 
PLEASE SAINSBURY'S SEND OUR KIT 
SAINSBURY'S HAVE STRESSED 
HOW SUCCESSFUL THE ACTIVE KIDS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN 
LAST YEAR THEY MADE OVER THIRTY TWO THOUSAND DELIVERIES 
THEY SAY THEY TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY WHEN THINGS GO WRONG 
AND THEY ACCEPT THAT ERRORS WERE MADE 
THE GIRLS HAVE GOT THE EQUIPMENT HERE THEY ARE LOOKING VERY HAPPY 
THERE WERE A FEW EXTRAS THROWN IN THERE AS WELL 
GOOD FOR THEM BUT HERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH A BIG NAME 
TALKTALK SOMETIMES CAN HAVE TROUBLE 
UNDERSTANDING THE TERM EX DIRECTORY 
THE FIRST TELEPHONE BOOK WAS INVENTED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT 
THEN IT HAD JUST FIFTY NUMBERS 
NOW THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF WAYS OF GETTING HOLD OF A NUMBER 
ONLINE A PHONE ENQUIRY SERVICE OR THROUGH THE OLD FASHIONED DIRECTORY 
THESE DAYS THE PHONE BOOK IS GETTING SLIMMER 
BECAUSE HALF OF US ARE CHOOSING NOT TO BE LISTED BY GOING EX DIRECTORY 
BUT THAT MIGHT NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
SOME CUSTOMERS DID NOT WANT THEIR DETAILS PUBLISHED 
SO HOW COME THEY'RE STILL IN HERE FOR ANYONE TO SEE 
TALKTALK THE CARPHONE WAREHOUSEPHONE SERVICE 
WAS LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE TO RIVAL B. T. 
THEY HAVE OVER THREE MILLION CUSTOMERS NICHOLAS IS ONE OF THEM 
I SIGNED UP IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
THEY WERE CHEAPER AND OFFERED WEEKEND CALLS 
I REQUESTED THAT I CONTINUE BEING EX DIRECTORY 
NICHOLAS HAD BEEN EX DIRECTORY FOR TEN YEARS TO AVOID NUISANCE CALLS 
BUT IN JANUARY THIS YEAR HE GOT A NASTY SHOCK 
I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE PHONE BOOK FOR MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY IN THERE 
I CAME ACROSS MY NAME IN BOLD WRITING 
IT MADE ME VERY ANGRY IT GOES OUT TO EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTY 
NICHOLAS PHONED B. T. 
THEY TOLD HIM TALKTALK HAD SUPPLIED THEM WITH HIS INFORMATION 
TALKTALK SAID AS FAR AS THEY WERE CONCERNED HE WAS NOT EX DIRECTORY 
ALTHOUGH THEY'VE AGREED TO PUT RIGHT THEIR MISTAKE HIS NAME 
WILL STAY IN THE PHONE BOOK FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR 
CARL PARR HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET HIS NAME OUT OF THE PHONE BOOK 
IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HE ALSO TOLD TALKTALK HE WANTED TO BE EX DIRECTORY 
I WANTED TO HAVE CONTROL OVER WHO HAS MY PHONE NUMBER 
AND STOP THE MARKETING CALLS THAT I WOULD OFTEN RECEIVE 
BUT ALARM BELLS STARTED TO RING 
WHEN HE ANSWERED A CALL HE WAS TRYING TO AVOID 
I WAS CONTACTED BY SOMEBODY I DIDN'T WANT TO BE CONTACTED BY 
THAT MADE ME DUBIOUS OF HOW THEY HAD GOT MY PHONE NUMBER 
AND THAT MADE ME LOOK ON THE INTERNET 
AT THE PHONE BOOK TO FIND THAT MY NAME WAS BEING PUBLISHED IN IT 
THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
TALKTALK PROMISED TO REMOVE HIS DETAILS FROM THE DIRECTORY 
BUT THEN THE NEXT YEAR'S PHONE BOOK ARRIVED 
AND HIS NAME WAS STILL THERE 
IT'S LIKE BANGING YOUR HEAD AGAINST A BRICK WALL 
I'VE REQUESTED TO BE EX DIRECTORY FOR THREE YEARS 
WHEN COMPANIES RELEASE YOUR DETAILS WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION 
THEY'RE BREAKING THE LAW 
BUT THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE MORE SERIOUS 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU WENT EX DIRECTORY 
BECAUSE OF THE REAL DANGER OF SOMEONE FINDING OUT WHERE YOU LIVE 
THIS WOMAN DOESN'T WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED 
I'VE BEEN EX DIRECTORY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
AFTER BEING THE VICTIM OF A SERIOUS PHYSICAL ASSAULT 
I WANTED TO KEEP MY ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER FROM BEING DISCOVERED 
BUT IN MARCH LAST YEAR 
SHE DISCOVERED TALKTALK HAD GIVEN HER DETAILS TO ONE NINETY TWO C. O. M. 
SHE HAD THEM REMOVED BUT SHE RECEIVED 
A COPY OF THE LATEST PHONE BOOK AND HER NAME WAS IN THERE AS WELL 
TO MY HORROR IT WAS LISTED BUT NOT JUST MY INITIAL MY FULL FIRST NAME 
AND MY ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER 
I FELT SICK BECAUSE UPON SEEING IT 
I KNEW THAT THIS BOOK WOULD BE IN CIRCULATION 
AND ANYBODY WANTING TO FIND ME KNOWING THE AREA I WAS IN 
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO 
TALKTALK HAVE PROMISED SHE WON'T BE IN THE NEXT PHONE BOOK 
AND OFFERED HER COMPENSATION 
SHE'S UNHAPPY THEY RELEASED HER DETAILS IN THE FIRST PLACE 
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE FOR ME AND MY FAMILY 
WE ARE HAVING TO LOOK TO MOVE WHICH IS SOMETHING WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO 
IT MAKES ME FEEL VERY ANGRY BUT MAINLY UM SCARED 
VERY SCARED 
BEING EX DIRECTORY SHOULDN'T BE COMPLICATED 
YOU'RE EITHER IN OR OUT SO IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW THEY GOT THIS WRONG 
THESE ARE YOUR DETAILS 
SO YOU SHOULD CONTROL WHO GETS TO SEE THEM 
WELL TALKTALK APOLOGISED TO THE CUSTOMERS IN THAT FILM 
THEY BLAME HUMAN ERROR AND SAY THEY HAVE CONDUCTED 
AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF PROCEDURES 
TO ENSURE THIS SITUATION SHOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN 
NEXT PAUL HEINEY DISCOVERS THAT GETTING CASH ABROAD 
IS TRICKIER THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT 
AT LEAST IF YOUR BANK HAS GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT 
ORGANISING YOUR HOLIDAY MONEY USED TO BE PRETTY COMPLICATED 
YOU'D ORDER TRAVELLERS CHEQUES OR BUY YOUR FOREIGN CURRENCY IN ADVANCE 
BUT MODERN BANKING HAS MADE BEING A TOURIST A LOT SIMPLER 
THESE DAYS ALL YOU SHOULD NEED IS ONE OF THESE 
AND WHEREVER YOU ARE IN THE WORLD YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS 
TO YOUR MONEY TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY JUST AS IF YOU WERE AT HOME 
BUT YOUR BANK MAY HAVE OTHER IDEAS AND RELY ON PLASTIC AND YOU COULD 
GET CAUGHT IN A TOURIST TRAP YOU DIDN'T SEE COMING 
GARY SHILLINGFORD AND HIS WIFE WENT TO NEW YORK IN FEBRUARY 
THE FIRST FEW DAYS WE WENT TO LIBERTY ISLAND EMPIRE STATE 
AND IT WAS BRILLIANT THOROUGHLY GOOD TIME 
BUT THEN IT ALL WENT SOUR 
GARY WAS USING HIS CAPITAL ONE CREDIT CARD TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING 
BUT IT STOPPED WORKING JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PAY FOR LUNCH 
WELL I WAS SHOCKED EMBARRASSED BECAUSE I COULDN'T PAY MY BILL 
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO I'VE GOT NO MEANS OF PAYING FOR ANYTHING 
GARY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN HIS BANK TOLD HIM 
THEY'D DETECTED UNUSUAL ACTIVITY ON HIS CARD AND HAD PUT A BLOCK ON IT 
CAPITAL ONE SAID TO ME BECAUSE THERE WAS ERRONEOUS ITEMS 
COMING THROUGH FROM NEW YORK 
THEY THOUGHT THIS IS STRANGE WE'LL PUT A STOP ON IT 
I SAID I'M IN NEW YORK OF COURSE I'M GOING TO SPEND ON PLASTIC 
CAPITAL ONE HAD LEFT A MESSAGE ABOUT THE BLOCK ON GARY'S HOME PHONE 
WHICH OBVIOUSLY HE HADN'T HEARD AS HE WAS IN NEW YORK 
WITH A BLOCKED CARD THE COUPLE SPENT THE DAY IN THEIR HOTEL ROOM 
IT TOOK TWENTY FOUR HOURS FOR THE BLOCK TO BE LIFTED 
IT'S VERY UNSETTLING YOU GET SO USED TO USING YOUR CARDS EVERYWHERE 
EVERYONE SAYS YOU DON'T NEED CASH NOWADAYS 
WELL YOU DO WITH CAPITAL ONE 
THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE YOU MIGHT THINK OF TELLING BEFORE A HOLIDAY 
YOUR BOSS THE MILKMAN AND PERHAPS THE NEIGHBOURS TOO 
BUT IT SEEMS YOU SHOULD ADD YOUR BANK TO THAT LIST 
OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT STOP YOU GETTING HOLD OF YOUR OWN MONEY 
AND YOU WILL GET THE BLAME 
JAMES HEWSON WAS HAVING A LOVELY TIME IN ROME LAST MONTH 
UNTIL HIS ABBEY DEBIT CARD STOPPED WORKING 
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SHOPPING TRIP 
I'D SPENT MY MONEY SO I THOUGHT I BETTER GO TO THE BANK 
SO I WENT TO THE BANK MACHINE AND IT JUST KEPT COMING UP WITH 
YOUR BANK HAS INSTRUCTED US TO RETURN YOUR CARD 
HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT HE HAD THOUSANDS OF POUNDS IN HIS ACCOUNT 
ABBEY SAID THEY'D BLOCKED HIS CARD 
AND HE'D HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE FRAUD DEPARTMENT TO FIND OUT WHY 
BUT HE COULDN'T GET THROUGH AND HE WAS DOWN TO HIS LAST FEW EUROS 
IT WAS JUST UTTER DISBELIEF THAT I WAS REFUSED ACCESS TO MY OWN FUNDS 
THE FACT THAT REALLY ANNOYED ME 
IS THEY HAD MY PHONE NUMBER AND THEY NEVER BOTHERED TO RING ME 
THEY JUST LEFT ME HIGH AND DRY 
JAMES COULDN'T AFFORD TO EAT AND HAD NO MONEY FOR TRANSPORT 
SO HE EVEN HAD TO WALK HALF THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT FOR HIS FLIGHT HOME 
I HAD NO ONE WHO I COULD JUST SAY CAN YOU LEND ME SOME MONEY 
JAMES WENT STRAIGHT INTO HIS LOCAL BRANCH TO DEMAND AN EXPLANATION 
THEY SAID IT WAS HIS FAULT HE HADN'T TOLD THEM HE WAS GOING ABROAD 
MAKE SURE I'VE GOT MY MOSQUITO SPRAY AND BETTER TELL THE BANK 
I'M GOING AWAY FOR A WEEK AS WELL 
LEYTON PRICE IS ALSO AN ABBEY CUSTOMER 
HIS DREAM HOLIDAY TO CAPE TOWN WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND WAS RUINED 
WHEN ABBEY BLOCKED HIS CARD WHEN HE TRIED TO USE IT THERE 
AND IT WAS DAYS BEFORE THEY GAVE HIM ACCESS TO HIS MONEY AGAIN 
IT WAS DESPERATE 
WE WERE RUNNING OUT OF MONEY FAST 
SO WE WERE FINDING IT HARD TO FIND MONEY TO BUY FOOD DRINK 
IT WAS A GOOD FOUR TO FIVE DAYS 
BEFORE THE CARD WAS EVENTUALLY ACTIVATED 
IT WAS VERY DISTRESSING 
THE BLOCK WAS ONLY LIFTED AFTER HIS FATHER GOT INVOLVED FROM THE U. K. 
THE COUPLE HAD SPENT HUNDREDS ON MOBILE PHONE CALLS 
AND HAD CANCELLED MANY OF THE TRIPS AND ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'D PLANNED 
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE BOSS OF ABBEY WHY I WAS LEFT STRANDED 
WITH NO ACCESS TO MY FINANCES AFTER REPEATEDLY TALKING 
TO CUSTOMER SERVICE TO CONFIRM THAT I WAS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
AND ANSWERED ALL THEIR SECURITY QUESTIONS 
I'M EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN ABBEY 
LET'S SAY YOU DO SHARE YOUR TRAVEL PLANS WITH YOUR BANK 
WELL THEY COULD TAKE NO NOTICE AND STILL STOP YOU USING YOUR CARD 
TEN U. K. BANKS SAID THEY DO ADVISE CUSTOMERS TO SAY WHEN GOING ABROAD 
BUT EVEN IF YOU DO LET THEM KNOW NONE OF THEM COULD GUARANTEE 
YOUR CARD WOULDN'T GET BLOCKED ANYWAY 
BECAUSE THE DECISION TO DO SO IS MADE BY A COMPUTER 
MOST COMPANIES HAVE AN AUTOMATIC SYSTEM 
THAT TRIGGERS A BLOCK ON THE CARD 
WHEN THERE IS ERRATIC ACTIVITY ON THE SPENDING PATTERNS 
EVEN IF YOU TELL YOUR COMPANY 
YOU WERE GOING OVERSEAS THEY MIGHT STILL BLOCK THE CARD 
OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION WAS STOLEN LAST YEAR 
IN FRAUDULENT TRANSACTIONS ABROAD 
THE BANKS ARGUE THEIR SYSTEMS ARE SET UP TO STOP THIS HAPPENING 
BUT SOME CUSTOMERS THINK IT'S GONE TO FAR 
I DON'T SEE HOW THEY CAN JUSTIFY LEAVING PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION 
STRANDED WITH NO MEANS OF PAYMENT THEY REALLY COULDN'T CARE LESS 
WE ALL WANT PROTECTION FROM FRAUD 
BUT SOMETIMES WE WANT PROTECTION FROM OUR OWN BANKS 
BECAUSE IF YOU END UP STRUGGLING FOR CASH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD 
YOU MAY WISH YOU'D HOLIDAYED A LITTLE CLOSER TO HOME 
WELL CAPITAL ONE APOLOGISED TO OUR FIRST CASE 
THEIR FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEM IS TO DESIGNED PROTECT CUSTOMERS 
BUT IN COUNTRIES LIKE AMERICA WHICH DON'T USE CHIP AND PIN 
IT'S HARD TO TELL IF TRANSACTIONS ARE GENUINE 
SO LEGITIMATE ONES MAY BE DECLINED 
THEY RECOMMEND GIVING THEM YOUR MOBILE NUMBER SO THEY CAN RESOLVE 
CASES LIKE THIS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
ABBEY SAYS BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY ON THE CARDS 
THEY WERE FLAGGED AS SUSPICIOUS SO YOU CAN ONLY USE IT TO DRAW CASH 
IN A MACHINE THAT AGAIN HAS CHIP AND PIN 
IF IT DOESN'T THE CARD WON'T WORK 
ABBEY REITERATE THAT THIS IS TO PROTECT CUSTOMERS 
THEY SAY RESOLVING THE ROME CASE WAS COMPLICATED BY OTHER FACTORS 
GIVE THEM A MOBILE NUMBER SO THEY CAN CALL TO DISCUSS TRANSACTIONS 
WE ARE JOINED BY TONY BOORMAN FROM THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMAN SERVICE 
BEFORE PAUL'S REPORT WE WERE GETTING 
TEXTS ON THIS THIS IS BIG FOR A LOT OF OUR VIEWERS THIS ISSUE 
IT'S NOT JUST THE BANKS IN OUR FILM THEY ARE ALL AT IT 
YEAH WE GET A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE 
OF COURSE CUSTOMERS ARE DISAPPOINTED 
WITH COMPUTERS MAKING DECISIONS 
IT'S NOT YOUR FRIENDLY LOCAL BANK MANAGER 
THE COMPUTER DOESN'T KNOW YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE 
THERE IS SOMETIMES NO POINT TELLING THEM YOU ARE GOING ABROAD 
THERE ARE SENSIBLE PRECAUTIONS WE AS CUSTOMERS CAN TAKE 
IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE CARD TAKE MORE THAN ONE CARD 
IF YOU'VE GOT CASH TAKE CASH EVERYONE ACCEPTS CASH 
TAKE THE BANK'S TELEPHONE NUMBER SO YOU CAN PHONE THEM 
AND IF IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 
WELL YEAH THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS START TO OCCUR 
WHERE THE BANKS CLOSE IT'S A BANK HOLIDAY WEEKEND 
THERE ARE SOME REAL ISSUES ABOUT THE SPEED OF RESPONSE 
AND THE DIFFICULTIES YOU'VE HEARD IN YOUR REPORT TODAY 
THE BANKS SAY WITH THIS CHIP AND PIN YOU SHOULD BE O. K. 
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY HAVE IT 
I AM NOT TOO UP TO DATE ON WHERE WE'VE GOT IT AND WHERE WE HAVEN'T 
SO THERE ARE SOME DIFFICULT ISSUES 
AND THAT'S THE COMPLAINTS THAT COME TO US 
WHERE CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN LEFT AROUND WITH VERY LITTLE INFORMATION 
BUT TONY YOU HAVE FINED BANKS UP TO FOUR HUNDRED 
FOR LEAVING PEOPLE IN THE LURCH IN THESE SITUATIONS 
SO PEOPLE SHOULD GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU 
YOU COULD HELP THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION YES CERTAINLY 
IF YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED GET IN TOUCH WITH THE OMBUDSMAN SERVICE 
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN HELP THANKS TONY 
IF YOU'VE GOT A STORY FOR US TO INVESTIGATE GO TO THE WEBSITE 
OR GIVE US A CALL ON OH TWO OH EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE ONE THOUSAND 
OR WRITE TO US 
IT COULD BE YOUR STORY ON THE SHOW NEXT WEEK 
MOST TEXTS ARE ABOUT THE BANKS 
MY BANK LEFT ME FOR FOUR WEEKS WITHOUT ACCESS TO MY MONEY 
THAT'S JAMES IN DEVON 
MY HUSBAND AND I WERE STUCK IN BALI AND THE BANK STOPPED MY CARD 
THE CUSTOMER SERVICES NUMBER WAS NOT AVAILABLE 
IT COST ME ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ON THE HOTEL TELEPHONE TO SPEAK TO THE BANK 
I WAS TRAPPED IN MY HOTEL FOR THREE DAYS 
WE'RE BACK NEXT MONDAY SEVEN THIRTY P. M. 
FROM EVERYONE HERE THANKS FOR WATCHING GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT 
THEY BELIEVE A DEAD MAN'S SPIRIT CAN COME AFTER THEM FROM THE GRAVE 
IT'S ME YOU'RE TALKING TO GRACE IT'S ME 
SOMETHING HORRIBLE'S HAPPENED HERE 
AGH YOU ALL RIGHT 
BLOOD WAS FOUND ON A SHAWL THAT WAS AT THIS GRAVE O. K. 
HATRED DOESN'T BIND IT EATS AWAY IT DESTROYS LISTEN TO THIS 
SIR 
ONE SISTER BUT SHE LIVES ABROAD 
ONE SISTER BUT SHE LIVES ABROAD
