OF THE 
UP AND THIS WEEK IT HAS HAPPENED 
THE RUGBY FOOTBALL UNION FINALLY 
ASHTON USHERED ASHTON TO A SIDE 
DOOR THE WORLD CUP WINNING CAPTAIN 
HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN TO ACHIEVE WHAT 
HE DID AS A PLAYER FOR STUMP WE ARE 
PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT JOHNSON C. B. 
E. HAS 
BEEN APPOINTED 
AS ENGLAND TEAM MANAGER 
BRIAN ASHTON'S DEMISE HAS BEEN LONG 
EXPECTED AND PUBLICLY DISCUSSED A 
SLOW DEATH WITNESSED AND DEBATED BY 
ITS SUPPORTERS AND MEDIA 
WE 
EXPECT THAT EXPECT 
THAT THE 
RFU COULD HAVE HANDLED THINGS 
BETTER HOWEVER I DO NOT 
FEEL THAT 
BRIAN HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY DEALT 
WITH OVERALL 
I AM CONFIDENT THAT I KEPT BRIAN 
INFORMED INFORMED BRIAN IS A HIGHLY VALUABLE EMPLOYEE 
OF THE RFU HE REMAINS UNDER 
CONTRACT TO US THAT CONTRACT 
CATERS FOR BRIAN TO BE SWITCHED TO 
ALTERNATIVE ROLES WITHIN THE RFU 
CONTRARY TO VARIOUS REPORTS HE 
WILL NOT BE SUING THE RFU OVER THIS 
ISSUE ISSUE BRIAN HAS CONFIRMED TO ME HIS 
INTEREST IN TAKING UP THE NEW 
POSITION WE HAVE OFFERED HIM 
IN COMES MARTIN JOHNSON APPOINTED 
AS ENGLAND'S NEW MANAGER WITH TOTAL 
CONTROL AS IF ANYONE WOULD ARGUE 
HE BECOMES THE 
FOURTH MAN 
IN FOUR 
YEARS 
TO TAKE 
CHARGE 
A IN 
THE LAST 
YEAR OR 
SO I 
STARTED TO 
FEEL 
WOULD 
WANT TO 
GET BACK INTO THIS 
SORT OF DID 
I FEEL 
I WOULD DO THIS NO L. 
AM FULLY AWARE I HAVE 
NO EXPERIENCE 
OF MANAGING AT ANY LEVEL BUT I AM 
QUITE CONFIDENT THAT AS A 
MANAGEMENT TEAM WE CAN GET THE JOB 
DONE 
I AM DELIGHTED WITH THIS YEAR DONE IT IS THE START 
OF A 
NEW 
ERA TO 
MOVE ENGLAND 
BACK TO 
WHERE 
WE COULD 
BE AND 
SHOULD 
BE IN 
THE 
WORLD GAME 
I AM NOT HERE FOR THE 
EGO ALL 
FINANCES IT IS TO 
DO THIS 
JOB 
AND 
FOR THE 
ENGLAND TEAM TO BE 
SUCCESSFUL 
ON THE BRIGHTER SIDE OF SUCCESSFUL DARKER SIDE OF A BRIGHT NEW DAWN 
IS THE CONCERN THAT HIS C. V. IS BLANK 
WILL THE INSPIRATIONAL PLAYER BE AN 
EXCEPTIONAL CHOICE AS MANAGER 
UP WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT BRYAN 
MOORE BRIAN THE EXIT OF BRIAN 
ASHTON HAS HE BEEN HARSHLY 
TREATED 
I HAVE 
PREVIOUSLY TREATED PREVIOUSLY USED THE WORD DISGRACE I 
DON'T RETRACT 
FROM THAT AT ALL 
THE FACT THAT THE 
RFU HAVE 
FOUND 
THEMSELVES AT THE WRONG END OF A 
SEVERE INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNAL IS DOWN 
TO BRIAN ASHTON WHETHER 
HE TAKES 
ON 
OFFERED HIM 
IS ENTIRELY 
UP 
TO HIM 
BUT IT 
DOES 
NOT GET 
AWAY FROM 
THE 
BACK THAT 
HE HAS BEEN SHODDILY 
TREATED 
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN JOHNSON TREATED HE WAS A LEADER ON 
THE PITCH 
AND 
SOME WOULD 
SAY HE 
WAS 
A FACTOR 
COACH IN 
HIS LATER 
YEARS 
AS A 
PLAYER WILL 
HE MAKE 
A 
AND MANAGER THEY ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT 
ROLES I 
WOULD NOT 
HAVE 
THOUGHT HE 
WOULD DO THAT 
COACHING THE 
ESSENTIAL THING 
IS 
FOR HIM 
TO GET 
THE 
RIGHT TEAM 
BENEATH 
HIM HE 
NOW SEEMS 
TO HAVE 
THE AUTHORITY 
TO 
DO THAT 
BUT IT IS 
STILL A GAMBLE HE IS UNPROVEN IN 
THIS 
ROLE AND 
WHY 
HE REMAINS 
UNPROVEN YOU 
CANNOT SAY 
WITH ANY 
CERTAINTY THAT 
HE WILL 
BE A 
SUCCESS 
IT IS A GAMBLE 
WORTH TAKING 
NOW THEY 
HAVE DONE 
IT BUT THEY 
CANNOT SAY THAT THERE 
IS ANY 
CERTAINTY BEHIND IT AT ALL 
WE ARE HERE FOR LONDON IRISH 
AGAINST HARLEQUINS THE BIG MATCH 
IN THE PREMIERSHIP PLENTY OF TALK 
HAS BEEN ABOUT THAT MARTIN JOHNSON 
APPOINTMENT 
WHAT DO 
THE FANS THINK 
ABOUT IT 
I DON'T KNOW BRIAN ASHTON AFTER 
TAKING US TO THE WORLD CUP FINAL I 
BE NEATLY WORKED IN THE HIGHEST 
PLACE FOR FOUR YEARS MARTIN 
JOHNSON IS 
UNTRIED AS 
A 
BUT 
COULD BE 
VERY GOOD 
FOR ENGLAND 
HE COULD UNITE 
ALL THE 
UNDER ONE 
BANNER AND 
VERY GOOD FOR 
VERY GOOD FOR US IF HE 
IS GREAT PLAYER HE 
COACH I 
FEEL A 
BIT SORRY FOR BRIAN HIGH 
JOB IF 
A GOOD 
PLAYER DOES 
NOT MAKE JOB A GOOD MANAGER 
THAT IS DEBATABLE 
BUT I THINK HE WILL 
I LIKE THE IDEA BUT THEY SHOULD 
HAVE HANDLED 
IT BETTER IF IT IS 
HAVE HANDLED IT BETTER IF IT IS GREAT FOR ENGLAND 
I THINK 
BRIAN ASHTON 
HAS HAD 
PRETTY 
BAD DEAL 
OUT OF THE WHOLE 
AFFAIR AFFAIR QUITE ENOUGH ABOUT 
MARTIN JOHNSON 
WE ARE HERE TO SEE LONDON IRISH

HURRICANES WOULD BE IN THE 
SHAKE UP AT THIS STAGE OF THE 
SEASON WHAT A TALE THIS BUNCH

THE GREATEST SEASON IN THE LONG 
HISTORY OF THIS WONDERFUL CLUB BOB 
CASEY WITH SOME LAST MINUTE REPAIRS

HEINEKEN SEMI CUP FINAL

BREAST CANCER

EVEN THE REFEREES ARE DOING THEIR BIT THERE WILL BE SPLASHES OF PINK 
UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY 
IT IS 
BITTERLY 
COLD DAY IN THE 
THAMES 
VALLEY THE 
DYING EMBERS OF THE 
PREMIERSHIP SEASON THE REGULAR 
SEASON IRISH AGAINST HARLEQUINS A 
LONDON DERBY IN READING THE BALL 
IMMEDIATELY IN THE GIANT BUCKET 
SIZE HANDS OF NICK EASTER RICHARD DOCK THE IRISH NO EIGHT 
GATHERS AS WELL THORPE HE HAS 
JUST COMMITTED HIMSELF TO ANOTHER 
THREE YEARS WITH THE CLUB HE HAS 
WORKED SO HARD JUST TWO OF A 
NUMBER OF HUGELY TALENTED 
YOUNGSTERS ON DISPLAY TODAY 
TALENTED YOUNGSTERS WHO 
WILL BE 
TRYING TO 
CATCH THE EYE OF 
CERTAIN MR. 
JOHNSON IN THE MONTHS 
AHEAD THE CHURCHILL CUP TO AMERICA 
COMING UP 
FOR THE SAXONS 
AND THEN 
OF COURSE 
THE TRIP TO 
NEW ZEALAND MIKE BROWN A PRODUCT 
OF AN IMPRESSIVE YOUTH SYSTEM HE 
HAS HAD A GOOD SEASON BUT THAT WAS 
NOT GREAT NOW THERE IS A BATTLE FOR THE BALL 
ON THE GROUND THE PENALTY GOING 
IT IS BREEZY INSIDE THE STADIUM 
BUT NOTHING THAT SHOULD CONCERN THE 
THIRTY YEAR OLD AUSTRALIAN HAS HE GOT 
IT IT IS OFF THE POST AND IT IS 
GATHERED IN SKINNER WAS THE 
QUICKEST IT REMAINS SCORELESS 
HARLEQUINS BREAKING FROM DEEP HE 
WAS HELD UP BY A PEAK OF 
WHISTLE WHAT DOES THAT LOOK TELL 
YOU A LITTLE OVER FIVE MINUTES TO GO ONCE AGAIN 
THE SCRUM 
GOES TO 
ONCE AGAIN THE SCRUM GOES TO GROUND AND ONCE AGAIN 
WHITE'S PATIENCE IS STRETCHED TO 
BREAKING IS THIS THE 
FOR THE FIRST POINTS OF THE HALF 
WE MAY 
SEE SOME 
POINTS NOW 
WE MIGHT 
SEE A 
SCORE HE IT IS 
MIGHT SEE A SCORE HE IT IS EXCITING IT IS 
WONDERING IF A WEEK ON A FROM 
BRISTOL SALE ZERO TO ZERO WE ARE GOING TO 
SEE A SCORE HAS HE GOT IT HE HAS THE CHEERS 
OF RELIEF FROM ALMOST EVERYONE IN 
THE GROUND WE HAVE 
SOMETHING TO 
SHOUT ABOUT 
WE HAVE POINTS IT 
TAKEN THIRTY FIVE 
MINUTES BUT 
OFF THE 
BOOT OF 
ADRIAN JARVIS HARLEQUINS 
BOOT OF ADRIAN JARVIS HARLEQUINS FINALLY FINALLY ARE AHEAD THE COMBINATION OF ROB SHAW AND 
DAVID STRETTLE IT IS LONDON IRISH 
ZERO HARLEQUINS THREE 
IT HAS NOT BEEN A 
BAD 
BAD GAME 
IF THE IRISH BACKS WERE 
STOP RUNNING SIDEWAYS THEY MAY GET 
POINTS AT THE MOMENT VERY SO MUCH 
LATERAL RUNNING THEY HAVE NOT HAD 
ANY BALL HOP OFF FEED POSITION 
THEY HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO A GOAL 
ALL TO PLAY FOR IN THE SECOND HALF 
THEY HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO A GOAL ALL TO PLAY FOR IN THE SECOND HALF 
ALL TO PLAY FOR IN THE SECOND HALF WE HAVE NEW REFEREE CHRIS WHITE 
IS INJURED IN THE FIRST HALF AND 
HAS BEEN REPLACED BY SHAUN DAVEY THERE MUST BE MORE THAN THREE 
POINTS IN THE NEXT FORTY MINUTES 
SURELY IT IS BIG FORTY MINUTES THE 
FOURTH OFFICIAL JUST TESTING THAT 
SHIRT I AM NOT SURE SHAUN DAVEY HAS HAD A WORD ON THE 
SIDES HE CAN'T TELL NEITHER OF 
THEM CAN TELL THE MATCH OFFICIAL 
IS LOOKING AT THESE PICTURES HE 
HAS LOST THE BALL THERE IT IS AN 
IMPORTANT TACKLE IN THE END WHEN WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SEEN A GAME 
AND WIN THREE ZERO 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT 
HE PLAYED IN NINE SIX AGAINST SCOTLAND 
IT WAS MARVELLOUS IT SCOTLAND IT WASN'T ANOTHER PEEP ON THE WHISTLE I 
THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A YELLOW 
CARD FOR MIKE BROWN HARLEQUINS ARE 
DOWN TO FOURTEEN AND THE DOOR OF 
OPPORTUNITY MIDGES OPEN COUPLE OF INCHES FOR THE ART IRISH HAVE WE GOT THREE POINTS ALLELUIA 
LET THE FLAGS BE RAISED THE IRISH 
HAVE THEIR FIRST THREE POINTS OF 
THE MATCH AND UNBELIEVABLY IT HAS 
TAKEN SIXTY SIX AND ONE HALF MINUTES INTO THE HARLEQUINS TWENTY TWO IT IS A PENALTY TO THE IRISH WITH 
ONLY SIX POINTS IN THE FIRST SEVENTY 
MINUTES THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT 
MOMENT THEY ARE AHEAD THEY ARE AHEAD FOR 
THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR THEY WERE 
SCORELESS NOW THEY HAVE SIX OF THE 
LITTLE BEAUTIES 
THEY MIGHT FEEL 
HARD DONE BY IT ON THAT DECISION 
BUT THEY HAVE NOT GOT ANYWHERE NEAR 
IRISH REALLY THEY SHOULD BE 
FURTHER BEHIND FIVE MINUTES TO GO HARLEQUINS MIGHT NOW SENSE THEY ARE 
PLAYING FOR THEIR PLACE IN THE TOP 
FOUR WITH THOSE TOUGH GAMES AGAINST 
SALE AND LEICESTER TO CONCLUDE 
THEIR REGULAR SEASON ONE MORE SCORE WOULD SURELY NOW FINISH IT A MATCH THAT HAS BEEN ASLEEP FOR 
MINUTES NOW BURSTS INTO LIFE THEY 
NOW KNOW DEAD GOOSE MIGHT BE CAUGHT 
OJO WITH THE FIRST TRY OF THE GAME 
THREE AND ONE HALF MINUTES FROM ITS CONCLUSION 
THE BREAK ONCE AGAIN HERE HIS 
PASSING HAS NOT BEEN THE MOST 
ACCURATE ALL MATCH THAT ONE WAS ON 
THE HALF VALLEY OH JOE HAD BEWARE 
TO FINISH IT OFF IT DIFFICULT 
BOUNCING BALL QUINS CAN SEE THE 
TRY THAT MAY COST THEM THE GAME 
THE DISADVANTAGE OF MISSING A FULL 
BACK THEY HAVE BEEN SO DAMNED DOMINANT 
TERRITORIALLY THERE IS NOTHING 
ELSE THERE MUST BE MORE IN FOR 
THEM 
WHAT AN INFLUENCE THIS MAN THEM HAS HAD HE ONLY JOINED THIS SEASON I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE GOT IT HE 
THINKS HE HAS GOT IT HE HAS GOT IT 
WHAT AN INFLUENCE WHAT A KICK IN 
THE TERMS OF THIS MATCH A BIG BIG 
MOMENT THE IRISH NOW LEADING BY THIRTEEN 
POINTS TWO MINUTES LEFT TO PLAY 
AND HARLEQUINS HOPES OF FINISHING 
IN THE TOP FOUR OF WHAT WILL BE 
THERE TO ASSIST PREMIERSHIP 
POSITION IN YEARS ARE BEGINNING TO 
HANG BY A THREAD MIKE BROWN IS 
BACK ON BETTER THAN TWO MINUTES TO GO 
ANOTHER YELLOW CARD WHO IS THIS 
FOR I THINK IT MIGHT BE FOR BOB 
CASEY IT IS LONDON IRISH ARE NOW 
DOWN TO FOURTEEN PLAYERS THEMSELVES 
OPPORTUNITY FOR HARLEQUINS DON'T 
THINK THEY HAVE THE TIME TO WIN IT 
BECAUSE AT THIS MOMENT FROM BOB 
CASEY LATE TACKLE ON DANNY KEFU 
BEHIND QUINS MAY HAVE THE CHANCE 
TO BRING IT BACK DANNY CARE A MAN WHO IS HIGHLY HEADING FOR 
BRISTOL AT THE END OF THE SEASON 
MAY HAVE WON LAST OPPORTUNITY THIS MIGHT BE IMPORTANT HE HAS 
GOT THE THREE POINTS QUINS ARE 
BACK WITHIN SEVEN IS THERE TIME TO 
LAUNCH THE UNLIKELIEST OF RACKET 
RESCUE BIDS THAT IS THE WHISTLE FROM SHAUN 
DAVEY THERE IS THE FINAL WHISTLE 
WHAT A FINISH WHAT A CONCLUSION 
THE LARGE SLICE OF THIS GAME WAS A 
REAL STINKER BUT IT CRACKLED INTO 
LIFE RIGHT AT THE END THE IRISH 
HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES A REAL SHOT 
AT THE TOP SIX IN THE PREMIERSHIP 
QUINS MAY YET MAKE THE TOP FOUR 
THEY ARE LOSING BONUS POINT MAY NOT 
HURT BUT THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO 
TOUGH WEEKENDS LEFT AHEAD IN THE 
REGULAR SEASON 
TOUGH WEEKENDS LEFT AHEAD IN THE REGULAR SEASON 
NOT A CLASSIC HIGH 
REGULAR SEASON SCORING GAME PRETTY INTERESTING 
THAT A LONDON IRISH DID NOT PUT 
QUINS AWAY 
IN TERMS OF QUALITY IT 
WAS A POOR GAME IT WAS EXCITING ON 
THE LAST PEOPLE KEPT THE BALL TO 
EACH OTHER BUT QUINS SHOULD BE 
SATISFIED WITH A BONUS POINT 
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T REALLY DESERVE 
THAT IRIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LONG 
WAY IN FRONT AT HALF TIME AND FULL 
TIME IRISH LONDON IRISH WINNER 
I THOUGHT THE FIRST TWENTY FIVE MINUTES WE 
TRY TO RUN THEM RAGGED IT IS 
SHAME WE DIDN'T SCORE THEY CREATED 
THE OPPORTUNITIES AT THE END OF 
THE DAY THE MILES THEY HAD TO 
COVER IN THOSE FIRST TWENTY FIVE MINUTES IT 
TOLD AND WE FINISHED STRONG 
A FEW 
POSITIVES CAME 
OUT OUR 
DEFENCE WAS 
PRETTY GOOD HUGE AMOUNT OF 
ENTHUSIASM AS YOU CAN SEE WE 
ATTEMPTED TO PLAY FROM WAS DONE 
AS WAS IT DIDN'T WORK 
THEY PLAYED 
SOME REALLY GOOD RUGBY AND THE TWO 
SIDES MATCHED EACH OTHER WE 
DEFENDED REALLY WELL AND FOR CREDIT 
TO OUR BOYS WHO DEFENDED REALLY 
WELL UNLUCKY TO NOT GET THE TRY IN 
THE END WE GOT THERE BUT WOULD 
HAVE LIKED TO HAVE WON THIS GAME 
WE HAVE TO GIVE OURSELVES CHANCE 
AS WE WANT TO BE IN THE TOP SIX 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS AGAINST 
TOULOUSE WE WILL BE IN EUROPE 
AGAIN AND TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO 
KEEP WINNING IN THE PREMIERSHIP WE 
HAVE LEEDS AT HOME NEXT AND SAIL 
AWAY IT IS ACHIEVABLE 
THERE ARE A 
FEW BOYS DISAPPOINTED AFTER TODAY 
WE HAVE TWO WEEKS TO SORT IT OUT 
BEFORE WE PLAY AGAINST SALE WE 
WILL SEE 
BEFORE WE PLAY AGAINST SALE WE WILL SEE 
WILL SEE GLOUCESTER CONFIRMED THESE 
RELEGATION WITH BONUS POINT 
VICTORY A WIN FOR LEICESTER IN 
BEATING BRISTOL AND BATH SNEAKED A 
WIN AT WORCESTER OUR NEXT 
HIGHLIGHTS IN TWO WEEKS' TIME WE 
ARE AT THE RECREATION GROUND FOR 
BATH AGAINST SARACENS 
ARE AT THE RECREATION GROUND FOR BATH AGAINST SARACENS 
IT WASN'T A BAD GAME OF RUGBY 
HARLEQUINS AT LEAST TOOK A POINT 
AT THIS STAGE THEY HAD TO TAKE 
SOMETHING 
IT IS BETTER THAN SOMETHING NOTHING THEY PROBABLY FEEL LUCKY 
TO GET THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE 
DOMINATING THROUGHOUT IT LEAVES 
THEIR CHALLENGE AT A KNIFE EDGE 
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO DROP 
ANY MORE POINTS YOU CAN PROBABLY 
AFFORD TO HAVE A LOSING BONUS POINT 
BUT THAT IS IT FOR THE REST OF THE 
SEASON 
WE ARE STAYING WITH RUGBY SEASON BITS SWITCHING TO A SALFORD AND 
JOINING CLARE BALDING GOODBYE FROM 
US
