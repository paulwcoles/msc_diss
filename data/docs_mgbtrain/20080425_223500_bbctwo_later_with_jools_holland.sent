THANK YOU THE PIGEON DETECTIVES 
NOW IT'S A PLEASURE AND A PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE AND HAVE A QUICK CHAT 
COS I'M DELIGHTED WE'LL BE PLAYING A PIECE OF MUSIC WITH HER LATER 
A TRUE LEGEND I WELCOME EARTHA KITT 
AH 
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU THANK YOU 
LET ME JOIN YOU AT THIS NICE PIANO STOOL WE'VE GOT HERE 
NOW YOU'VE JUST GOT HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING AT THE CHELTENHAM JAZZ FESTIVAL 
AND IN LONDON THE CHELTENHAM JAZZ FESTIVAL IS A LOVELY PLACE FOR YOU TO PLAY 
BUT LET ME GO RIGHT BACK WHAT WAS THE FIRST MUSIC THAT YOU EVER SANG 
UM AH 
A HA 
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER 
BUT IT WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL 
THE NEW YORK SCHOOL OF PERFORMING ARTS 
WHEN I WAS FORCED TO SING FOR THEM MADE TO SING YES 
BECAUSE I'M TOO SHY A SHY PERSON I DIDN'T REALISE THAT 
RRR RRR OH YES TERRIBLY 
WHERE DID YOU WAS IT WHEN YOU WERE DOING CATWOMAN 
THAT YOU LEARNED TO GROWL OR WAS IT BEFORE THEN OH YOU LEARNED TO GROWL LONG BEFORE THAT 
BECAUSE IN MY POSITION I WAS A YOUNG GIRL IN SCHOOL 
I WAS THE ONLY BROWN SKIN IN THE SCHOOL 
SO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF PROBLEM AROUND THE BOYS 
THEY WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE BROWN SUGAR YOU KNOW 
DID THE GROWL PUT THEM OFF OR MAKE THEM COME NEARER 
H. M. M. IT DEPENDS 
NO MOST OF THE TIME IT SHOOED THEM AWAY ACTUALLY 
BECAUSE THEY KNEW I WAS NOT INTERESTED 
I BELIEVE ALSO DIDN'T YOU GO ON TOUR IN PARIS 
AND WHEN THE REST OF THE TOURING PARTY CAME BACK YOU STAYED THERE 
OH WELL I WANTED TO COME BACK WITH THE DUNHAM COMPANY 
BECAUSE I HAD NO INTENTIONS OF LEAVING THE COMPANY I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH CHUTZPAH TO DO THAT ON MY OWN 
BUT MRS. DUNHAM FORCED ME TO BY SAYING I DARE YOU TO TRY ANYTHING ON YOUR OWN 
I WANTED TO GO OUT AND DO SOMETHING ON MY OWN AFTER OUR CURTAIN WENT DOWN IN PARIS 
AND SHE WAVED A FINGER IN MY FACE AND SAID I DARE YOU 
SO I TOOK THE DARE OH YES 
ARE YOU OFTEN TAKING DARES FROM PEOPLE CONSTANTLY WANNA TRY ME 
OH I JUST WONDERED ORSON WELLES 
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL HOW YOU GOT OUT OF THAT ONE I'M JUST MOVING ALONG I'M MOVING ONTO THE NEXT QUESTION O. K. 
IT'S YOU WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT NOT BORING OLD ME 
UM WHEN DID YOU I DON'T THINK YOU'RE BORING AT ALL 
THANKS VERY MUCH THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU TO SAY I KNOW THAT'S VERY KIND TAKE IT HOME TO YOUR WIFE 
O. K. SHE'S HERE ACTUALLY SO WE BETTER NOT DO ANYTHING THAT'S 
OR SHE MIGHT SEE IT ON THE T. V. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING PRIVATE BECAUSE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING 
HUSBANDS ARE MY FAVOURITE PEOPLE DO YOU LOVE HUSBANDS BEST I DON'T HAVE TO BE BOTHERED WITH THEM 
THAT'S VERY GOOD YOU CAN HAVE MY HUSBAND YOU CAN'T TAKE MY MAN DO YOU KNOW THAT SONG 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD SONG DARYL WATERS LOOK IT UP THEY DID THE SONG FOR YOU YES 
IS IT YOU WORKED WITH ORSON WELLES DIDN'T YOU 
YES NOW HE SAID ABOUT YOU THIS IS ORSON WELLES YOU ARE THE MOST EXCITING WOMAN IN THE WORLD 
YES YES I BELIEVE EVERYTHING HE SAID 
HE WAS A VERY ACCURATE AND WELL OF COURSE 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HIM OH HE WAS ALSO TERRIBLY EXCITING 
BUT ORSON WAS VERY STRANGE BECAUSE HE HAD TO BE DISCIPLINED 
AND WHEN HE WAS A DIRECTOR HE WAS GOOD AT THAT 
WHEN HE WAS AN ACTOR HE WAS WONDERFUL AT THAT 
BUT HE NEEDED SOMEONE THERE TO CONTROL HIM IN THE AREAS HE WANTED TO EXERCISE HIS ART IN AT THE TIME 
DID YOU DO THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING 
WE WERE VERY SILENT TOGETHER 
DO YOU THINK SEX AND MUSIC ARE INTRINSICALLY LINKED 
OF COURSE DON'T YOU THINK SO YES THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT 
OTHERWISE I DON'T THINK YOU'D HAVE GOTTEN INTO PLAYING THE PIANO 
BOOGIE WOOGIE SLASH SEX IT'S THE SAME THING YOU GET VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT THANK YOU 
I THINK IT'S TIME WE SHOWED A CLIP I THINK WE'VE GOT A CLIP OF YOU WITH ONE OF YOUR HITS 
SANTA BABY IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK OVER THIS WAY NOW HAS IT BEEN THAT FAR BACK 
SANTA BABY 
AN OUT OF SPACE CONVERTIBLE TOO 
LIGHT BLUE 
I'LL WAIT UP FOR YOU DEAR 
SANTA BABY AND HURRY DOWN THE CHIMNEY TONIGHT 
THINK OF ALL THE FUN I'VE MISSED 
THINK OF ALL THE FELLOWS THAT I HAVEN'T KISSED 
NEXT YEAR I COULD BE OH SO GOOD 
IF YOU CHECK OFF MY CHRISTMAS LIST 
SANTA HONEY I WANT A YACHT AND REALLY THAT'S NOT A LOT 
BEEN AN ANGEL ALL YEAR 
SANTA HONEY AND HURRY DOWN THE CHIMNEY TONIGHT 
THE WAY YOU THREW THAT COAT AWAY 
YOU KNOW THAT'S 
THAT'S VERY AMAZING TO ME BECAUSE IT'S VERY STRANGE HOW THE VOICE HAS CHANGED THROUGH THE YEARS 
ALSO TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED TO MAKE THINGS SOUND MUCH BETTER TODAY THAN THEY DID THEN 
BUT I DON'T THINK OF HER AS ME AT ALL DON'T YOU SHE'S A STRANGER TO ME 
IT'S THE SAME PERSON ISN'T IT I THINK IT IS YOU 
THE BODY IS THE SAME PERSON BUT I DON'T THINK OF HER THE SAME WHAT'S DIFFERENT 
BECAUSE AS I SAID I'M A TERRIBLY SHY PERSON 
EARTHA MAE THAT GIRL FROM THE SOUTH THAT EVERYBODY REJECTED AND SAID SHE WAS A YELLOW GAL 
AND TOO UGLY TO BELONG TO ONE GROUP AND DID PEOPLE SAY THAT YES 
WHEN YOU'RE CALLED A YELLOW GIRL IT MEANS YOU DON'T BELONG TO ANYBODY 
YOU'RE A REJECT TO EVERYBODY SO I WAS GIVEN AWAY SEVERAL TIMES AND FINALLY WOUND UP IN NEW YORK 
SO THE SHYNESS IS FROM THAT CHILD OF SOUTH CAROLINA WHEN NOBODY WANTS HER 
THEN WHEN I FOUND THE PLACE IN MYSELF I THINK TO EXECUTE AN ISM OF SURVIVAL 
THAT'S WHEN I FOUND EARTHA KITT MOST OF IT WAS HERE IN LONDON 
THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE EXPERIENCING WITH YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE 
PEOPLE CAN SEE AT THE CHELTENHAM JAZZ FESTIVAL AND THE PIGALLE CLUB

JUST MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS LIKE I DO 
WHEN THE SKIN DID PASS US WITH HER FRIENDS AT HER BACK 
CALLING ME A GOOD FOR NOTHING DIRTY YOU

AFTER KILLING AND DISMEMBERING HIS MOM

AND CLIMBING ON HIS BACK 
SENT HIM BACK TO VIETNAM
