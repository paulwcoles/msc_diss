TONIGHT EVEN THE THREAT OF 
INDUSTRIAL ACTION CAN SHUT DOWN 
BRITAIN'S OIL PRODUCTION BY A THIRD 
HOW CONFIDENT SHOULD WE FEEL ABOUT 
OUR ENERGY SUPPLIES WE ASK IF THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS CONTINGENCIES IN 
PLACE TO PREVENT PREVENT SHORTAGES 
AND PANIC AT THE PUMPS 
ARE YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND 
DID JACK BAUER IN TWENTY FOUR REALLY 
INFLUENCE TORTURE TECHNIQUES AT 
GUANTANAMO BAY WE HAVE THE FIRST 
INTERVIEW WITH THE LAWYER WHO 
APPROVED THEM 
IT'S NOT MY PERSONAL MORALS IN 
TERMS OF HOW YOU JUDGE THE 
SITUATION IT'S THE LAW AND THE 
LAW ALLOWED QUITE AL BIT 
AND FIVE YEARS AFTER THE CONFLICT 
BEGAN A REMINDER OF THE FORGOTTEN 
WAR IN DARFUR 
HAND ON NEWSNIGHT REVIEW AT ELEVEN 
O'CLOCK A SOLDIER'S STORY 
INSPIRED BY THE DIRECTOR'S BROTHER 
DORIS LESSING INVENTS NEW LIVES FOR 
HER PARENTS THIS TIME THEY SING 
WHAT DO YOU GET IF YOU MIX AND 
ARCTIC MONKEYS WITH A RUSSIAN 
GOOD EVENING THIS MAY BE A WEEK 
THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE ANXIOUS 
TO FORGET U. TURNS OVER TEN P. TAX ON 
WEDNESDAY THE TEACHERS' STRIKE ON 
THURSDAY AND BY FRIDAY THE 
PROSPECT OF SEVERE STRAINS ON THE 
U. K. OIL SUPPLY AS THE GRANGEMOUTH 
REFINERY IS SHUT DOWN IN THE FACE 
OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION THERE'S NO 
PANIC BUYING AT THE PETROL PUMPS 
YET BUT THE SPECTRE IS THERE AS 
ARE MEMORIES OF THE FUEL BLOCKADES 
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND WHICH HIT THE BLAIR 
ADMINISTRATION HARD IT WAS THE 
FIRST TIME THE TORIES OVERTOOK THEM 
IN THE POLLS FOR A GOVERNMENT THAT 
HAS MADE ENERGY SECURITY A PRIORITY 
THINGS DON'T LOOK GOOD THE 
REFINERY IS ALREADY SHUTTING DOWN 
WHETHER OR NOT THE STRIKE GOES 
AHEAD HERE'S PAUL MASON 
THE CHOKE POINTS IN THE GLOBAL OIL 
SUPPLY ARE LEGENDARY THERE IS THE 
STRAIT OF HORMUZ THE NARROWS THE 
WEIGHT OF THE SUEZ CANAL THE STORM 
PRONE GULF OF MEXICO BUT TONIGHT 
ITS NORTH SEA OIL WHICH IS AT STAKE 
AND OFFICIALS IN BRITAIN'S 
EMERGENCY PLANNING COMMITTEE ARE 
HAVING TO SCRAMBLE OVER AT 
GRANGEMOUTH ON THE FIRTH OF FORTH 
THE WORKERS AT THE GRANGEMOUTH WILL 
REFINERY ARE SET TO STRIKE FROM 
SUNDAY THE ISSUE IS THEIR PENSION 
SCHEME SCHEME EVERYBODY FIGHTING FOR EACH OTHER 
WE'VE WORKED TOO LONG TO JUST GIVE 
EVERYTHING UP WE'VE BEEN THERE A 
LOT OF YEARS AND ISSUED MAYBE THE 
WAY IT IS NOW ONE GUY DICTATING TO 
US AND IT SHOULDN'T BE THE WAY 
IT IS NOW 
THE GUY THEY ARE TALKING 
ABOUT IS THE VENTURE CAPITALIST WHO 
RUNS INEOS HE BOUGHT THE 
INSTALLATION FROM B. P. TWO YEARS AGO 
NOW INEOS WANTS TO CLOSE THE 
PENSION SCHEME HERE TO A NEW 
ENTRANTS 
THE CURRENT SCHEME IS NOT ENTRANTS SUSTAINABLE ABOUT A QUARTER OF OUR 
OVERALL EMPLOYMENT COSTS HERE AT 
GRANGEMOUTH ARE BASED ON THE 
PENSION SCHEME WHICH IS CURRENTLY 
NON CONTRIBUTORY NON CONTRIBUTORY IN THEORY A STRIKE AT GRANGEMOUTH 
ONLY STRANGLES THE SUPPLY OF PETROL 
TO SCOTLAND IT IS THE KNOCK ON 
EFFECT WHICH COULD STOP NORTH SEA 
OIL TO THE REST OF BRITAIN AND WE 
CAN SEE WHY IF WE LOOK AT THIS 
MATCH OF THE U. K.'S ENERGY 
INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN B. P. SAW THIS 
REFINERY IT DIDN'T SELL THE PLANT 
AT THE END OF THE CRUDE OIL 
PIPELINE THAT 
CONNECTS THE 
FORTIES 
WILL FIELD TO THE MAINLAND THIS 
BIT AT THE END NEEDS STEAM FROM THE 
GRANGEMOUTH INSTALLATION BUT A 
SAFETY IN AGREEMENT SIGNED THIS 
WEEK MEANS THERE WILL NOT BE ANY 
SAFETY IN AGREEMENT SIGNED THIS 
THAT MEANS BRINGING DOWN THE 
UTILITIES THAT RAISED THE STEAM 
THERE AND IT IS AS CONSEQUENCE 
OF THAT RAISED THAT THE 
PIPELINE WOULD BE SUPPLYING FOR 
THOSE TWO DAYS 
THE FORTIES 
PIPELINE SYSTEM SUPPLIES SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
BARRELS OF OIL A DAY AND EIGHTY 
MILLION CUBIC METRES OF GAS THAT'S 
ABOUT ONE THIRD OF U. K. DEMAND EVERY 
DAY ITS CLOSE SAYS THE INDUSTRY 
BODY IT WILL COST THE U. K. ECONOMY 
FIFTY MILLION A DAY 
IF IT DOES HAPPEN YOU CANNOT THEN 
JUST FLICK SWITCH AND TURN THESE 
FIELDS BACK ON TO PRODUCTION AGAIN 
IT IS GOING TO TAKE DAYS FOR THAT 
TO HAPPEN SO IF THEY ARE SHUT MY 
ESTIMATE IS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT 
A PERIOD OF ABOUT A WEEK'S LOST TO 
PRODUCTION WELL THAT'S LOT OF 
MONEY THAT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION 
WORTH OF LOST PRODUCTION 
INEOS HAS 
GROWN FROM NOTHING TO EIGHTEEN BILLION 
WORTH OF TURNOVER IN TEN YEARS IT 
SPECIALISES IN MODERNISING 
UNDERPERFORMING PLANTS STRIPPING 
OUT THE COSTS GORDON BROWN TONIGHT 
CALLED FOR CONCILIATION 
THERE IS 
NO NEED FOR AN INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE 
HERE PEOPLE SHOULD GET ROUND THE 
TABLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THE 
OFFICES OF ACAS ARE AVAILABLE FOR 
PEOPLE TO GET A RESOLUTION ON THIS 
DISPUTE AND THE SOONER THAT 
HAPPENS THE BETTER 
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WANT 
TO SEE IS A REPEAT OF THESE SCENES 
WHEN FUELLED PROTESTS PARALYSED THE 
COUNTRY ACCORDING TO ONE FORMER 
ENERGY MINISTER THE GOVERNMENT MAY 
SOON HAVE TO GET INVOLVED 
THERE IS NATIONAL STRATEGIC 
INTEREST ALWAYS THE ADVICE TO 
MINISTERS WOULD BE KEEP OUT IT'S 
NOTHING TO DO WITH US BUT 
SOMETIMES YOU DO ACTUALLY HAVE TO 
TAKE AN INTEREST SOMETIMES YOU 
HAVE TO INTERVENE AND KNOCK HEADS 
TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT 
SOMETHING WHICH APPEARS TO BE A 
LOCAL DISPUTE DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE 
A VERY MAJOR NATIONAL IMPLICATION 
ALL ENERGY SYSTEMS CREATE THEIR OWN 
SECURITY RISKS AND WITH OIL AND 
GAS IT'S ALL ABOUT BOTTLENECKS 
HERE IS THE BIG PICTURE FOR THE 
UNITED KINGDOM 
AS WELL AS THE FORTIES SYSTEM 
THERE IS THIS ONE WHICH GOES INTO 
TEESSIDE BUT YOU CANNOT SWITCH TO 
THIS WON'T EASILY BACTON IN EAST 
ANGLIA IS THE MAJOR FACILITY 
BECAUSE AS WELL AS NORTH SEA GAS 
IT IS HOME TO THE TWO BIG 
INTERCONNECT PIPES WHICH LINK 
BRITAIN TO EUROPE EASINGTON LINKS 
THE U. K. TO NORWAY IN CASE YOU'RE 
WONDERING ALL OF THIS IS PUBLICLY 
AVAILABLE BUT IT DOES PROMPT THE 
QUESTION HOUSE A CURE IS IT THE 
GAS SHORTAGE CAN BE PLUGGED BECAUSE 
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE PIPE SO WHY 
AREN'T THERE MORE OR OIL PIPELINES 
THIS COMES DOWN TO ECONOMICS 
FRANKLY THE TYPE OF FIELDS AND THE 
SIZE OF FEELS THAT WE ARE FINDING 
NOW IN THE NORTH SEA WON'T JUSTIFY 
EXPENDITURE ON MAJOR IN THE 
STRUCTURAL PROJECTS OF THAT NATURE 
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS 
THERE IS NO DIESEL ANYWHERE THIS 
IS THE FOURTH GARAGE WE HAVE BEEN 
IN I CANNOT GET ANY DIESEL 
THE THE MINISTERS HAVE LONG 
PLANNED FOR NATURAL DISASTER OR 
TERRORIST ATTACK 
THIS PROBLEM IS 
MORE PROSAIC A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP 
AND AN INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE 
I SPOKE TO OUR CORRESPONDENT A 
SHORT TIME AGO AND I ASKED HIM 
WHAT STAGE THINGS WERE AT 
NOW 
WELL THEY HAVE CLOSED THE PLANT 
DOWN DON'T BE FOOLED BY WHAT YOU 
CAN SEE BEHIND ME YOU MAY BE ABLE 
TO SEE LIGHT AND THE ODD A PLUME OF 
SMOKE THE ODD FLAME BUT THIS 
PLANT IS NO LONGER PRODUCING ANY 
PETROL OR DIESEL AND IT'S NOT 
EITHER PRODUCING ANY OF THE 
CHEMICALS THAT IT CHURNS OUT ALMOST 
ON A DAILY BASIS SO PRODUCTION 
HAS NOW CEASED SO ALL THIS TALK 
OF ELEVENTH HOUR DEALS AND APPEALS 
TO GET THE TWO SIDES BACK AROUND 
THE TABLE IT IS ALL PRETTY 
ACADEMIC BECAUSE HIS PLAN TO SHUT 
DOWN 
AND WINNER OF THE KNOCK ON DOWN EFFECTS OF THAT LIKELY TO BE HELD 
WHEN I'LL HAVE THE KNOCK ON 
EFFECTS THEY ARE ALREADY BEING 
FELT IF YOU TALK TOO MANY MOTORISTS 
IN SCOTLAND TODAY ALTHOUGH THERE 
HAS NOT BEEN WIDESPREAD PANIC 
BUYING THERE DOES SEEM TO HAVE 
BEEN TO IN GETTING HOLD OF FUEL AT 
CERTAIN STATIONS IT IS PARTLY 
BECAUSE MOTORISTS ARE FILLING UP 
THEIR TANKS SO THAT FORECOURTS ARE 
BUSIER THAN NORMAL THERE SEEMS TO 
BE A DELAY BEFORE THEY ARE GETTING 
RESUPPLIED BY TANKER MINISTERS SAY 
THERE IS PLENTY OF FUEL IN THE 
SYSTEM TO LAST WELL INTO NEXT 
MONTH THERE SHOULD BE NO EFFECT 
WHATSOEVER BUT THERE IS AN EFFECT 
YOU CAN SEE IT ON ALL THE PUBS 
WHICH HAVE BEEN CLOSED DOWN 
PUMPS 
I AM JOINED NOW FROM OXFORD PUMPS BY THE FORMER ENERGY MINISTER JOHN 
BATTLE THIS IS A GOVERNMENT THAT 
HAS TRIED TO MAKE ENERGY SECURITY A 
REAL PRIORITY AND THEY'LL IN A 
RIGHT OLD FIX NOW AREN'T THEY NO NO BECAUSE ENERGY SUPPLIES ARE SECURED 
THE LIGHTS ARE NOT GOING OUT 
TONIGHT THE SECURITY OF THE SYSTEM 
IS UNDERPINNED BY THE NATIONAL GRID 
AS PAUL SAID IN HIS FILM IN TERMS 
OF GAS SUPPLIES FOR ENERGY 
SUPPLIERS THE SYSTEM IS SECURE WE 
ARE TALKING ABOUT FUEL SUPPLIES 
THAT GO TO PETROL PUMPS TO GO IN 
OUR CARS AND VEHICLES L. WOULD HAVE 
TO SAY EVEN ON PAUL'S FIGURES HE 
REFERRED TO THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION BARRELS 
A DAY WHICH COME OUT OF THE NORTH 
SEA THE FORTIES FIELD BUT IF I 
REMEMBER RIGHTLY YES IT IS A THIRD 
OF BRITAIN'S ACTUAL AMOUNT OF 
ENERGY BUT TWO THIRDS OF THAT OIL 
IS ACTUALLY RE EXPORTED A BROAD SO 
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE KIND 
OF PRESSURE ON THE SYSTEM WHICH IS 
PERHAPS SUGGESTED ABROAD L. 
THINK PEOPLE ARE ANTICIPATING A 
CRISIS TOPPING UP UNNECESSARILY 
WHICH THEN PUTS PRESSURE ON 
SUPPLIERS AS WELL 
BUT EVEN IF THEY 
ANTICIPATED THE PROBLEM THERE IS A 
PROBLEM THERE IS A DIFFICULTY 
GETTING HOLD OF PETROL THERE IS A 
LAGGING RESUPPLY AND THERE IS A 
WEEK'S LOSS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION WORTH 
OF LOST PRODUCTION THIS IS NOT 
NOTHING IS IT 
IT IS NOT NOTHING 
IT IS A MASSIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT I 
COMPLETELY AGREE BUT IN A SENSE IT 
IS LOCAL TEMPORARY SURPRISE WHICH 
IS THE PROBLEM IN SCOTLAND 
SUPPLIES THERE ARE EIGHT OTHER 
REFINERIES IN BRITAIN BUT WHEN WE 
ARE TALKING ABOUT SECURITY I THINK 
THE SYSTEM IS RATHER MORE SECURE 
THAN THE IMPRESSION WE'RE BEING 
GIVEN 
IF YOU WERE GORDON BROWN NOW GIVEN WOULD YOU GO FOR RATIONING WOULD 
YOU CONDEMN FUEL COMPANIES FROM 
HIKING THE PRICE OF FUEL WOULD YOU 
CONSIDER A TEMPORARY DROP IN FUEL 
DUTY 
IF PEOPLE AT THE PUMP AND DUTY COMPANIES THAT SELL AND RETAIL 
PETROL ARE EXPLOITING THIS TO MAKE 
A KILLING THEN THEY SHOULD BE 
HAMMERED FOR IT COS THERE IS NO 
NEED FOR IT L. THINK THE REAL 
MESSAGE IS THAT THE TRADE UNIONS 
NEED TO GET TOGETHER WITH THE 
COMPANY BUT AT THIS STAGE IT IS 
NOT NECESSARILY TO WHEEL OUT AN 
EMERGENCY PLAN IT IS NOT 
NECESSARY 
IF THEY ARE DOING THAT NECESSARY DOES IT HELP IF WE HAVE MALCOLM 
WICKS SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS 
PANIC BUYING GOING ON ALREADY I I THINK YOUR FILM SUGGESTS THAT SOME 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THE PUMP AND 
PUTTING MORE IN THEIR TANKS THAN 
THEY NEED L. WOULD NOT CALL IT 
PANIC IF PEOPLE ARE TOPPING UP IN 
ANTICIPATION OF SOMETHING HAPPENING 
IT IS A BIT LIKE A RIPPLE EFFECT ON 
THE MOTORWAY IF SOMEBODY PUTS THE 
BRAKES ON YOU CAN GET A BACK UP 
FOR MILES DOWN THE ROAD SO WE CAN 
AFFECT BEHAVIOUR IN THE WAY WE 
DESCRIBED THE SITUATION THAT IS 
PART OF THE PROBLEM 
YOU KNOW 
WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT OR NOT IS 
DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE AND YOU DO 
NOT BELIEVE THERE IS A SECURITY 
PROBLEM MUCH BLAME WILL BE LAID AT 
THE DOOR OF THE GOVERNMENT IF THIS 
DOES NOT GO ACCORDING TO PLAN AND 
GORDON BROWN CANNOT AFFORD TO 
INVOKE THAT IMAGE OF THE FUEL 
BLOCKADES OF TWO THOUSAND RIGHT NOW ALL ALL PARTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE IT IS THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE TRADE UNIONS 
AND THE COMPANY TO SIT DOWN I 
THINK THE OFFER FROM ACAS THEY ARE 
NOT INVOLVED IN THIS DISPUTE BUT I 
GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DOOR IS 
OPEN AT ACAS FOR THEM TO GET ROUND 
THE TABLE THAT'S THE WAY THAT 
HOPEFULLY WE CAN SOLVE DISPUTES IN 
THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WITHOUT GOING 
THROUGH ALL THIS PRESSURE YES 
BUTTERFLY WINGS AS SOMEONE SAID IN 
BRAZIL AFFECT THE WEATHER 
THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY BUT WE 
HAVE GOT TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT 
THE REALITY IS 
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES LIKE SLEEP 
DEPRIVATION WERE USED ON PRISONERS 
IN GUANTANAMO BAY IN DIRECT 
CONTRAVENTION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 
NOW LAWYERS WORKING UNDER THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION FEAR THEY COULD BE 
SUBJECT TO A WAR CRIMES 
INVESTIGATION ONE OF THOSE DIANE 
BEAVER BELIEVES SHE WAS LET DOWN 
BY HER SUPERIORS SHE GAVE HER 
FIRST TELEVISION INTERVIEW TO PETER 
MARSHALL MARSHALL JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG CLASSIC 
FILM ABOUT UNIQUE MOMENT IN 
INTERNATIONAL LAW 
THE CASE IS UNUSUAL IN THAT THE 
DEFENDANTS ARE CHARGED WITH CRIMES 
COMMITTED IN THE NAME OF THE LAW 
IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT NOISE FROM NAZI 
GERMANY HAD TO ONE SO FOR THE 
CRIMES OF THE REGIME THEY HAD 
SERVED SERVED HE EMBODIMENT OF WHAT PASSED FOR 
JUSTICE DURING THE THIRD REICH 
SIXTY YEARS ON IT IS CLAIMED THAT 
TRIBULATIONS AT GUANTANAMO THEY 
COULD HAVE LEFT ANOTHER GROUP OF 
LAWYERS HAVING TO EXPLAIN 
THEMSELVES TO AN INTERNATIONAL 
COURT 
I WORKED WITH THE INTERROGATORS 
OUR JOB WAS TO GET INTELLIGENCE 
THAT MIGHT SAVE LIVE BUT TO DO IT 
IN AN ETHICAL LEGAL MANNER BUT BUT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO ARGUE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT 
THAT'S NOT MY ROLE IT PRESIDENT IT WAS TWO THOUSAND TWO THE YEAR AFTER THE 
ATTACKS ON AMERICA GEORGE BUSH 
ANNOUNCED THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS 
DIDN'T APPLY TO GUANTANAMO BAY 
DETAINEES BEHIND THE SCENES IN 
WASHINGTON SENIOR LAWYERS WERE 
WRITING CONFIDENTIAL MEMOS 
JUSTIFYING THE MOST ROBUST 
INVESTIGATIONS ONE OF THEM WROTE 
IN AUGUST 
THE CONSTRAINTS ON INTERROGATION 
ARE GONE ONCE YOU'VE GOT RID OF 
GENEVA AND THEN ONCE YOU HAVE SAID 
THROUGHOUT THE MEANS THE TORTURE 
TEAM DOESN'T APPLY YOU'VE GOT A 
BLANK PIECE OF PAPER 
DIANE BEAVER 
HAD BEEN TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN THE U. S. 
MILITARY MORE THAN HALF AS A JUDGE 
ADVOCATE AND ARMY LAWYER SHE 
ARRIVED AT GUANTANAMO IN THAT 
SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND TWO 
PEOPLE WERE 
PARTICULARLY IN THE INTELLIGENCE 
SIDE WERE VERY DETERMINED TO TRY 
TO GET INFORMATION THAT WOULD LEAD 
TO SAVING LIVES ON THE BATTLEFIELD 
AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY IN AMERICA 
BECAUSE AL QAEDA HAS A PLANNING 
CYCLE THAT'S VERY LONG SO PERHAPS 
THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER ATTACK AND 
WE COULD PREVENT THAT THE NUMBER 
OF DETAINEES SHOWED RESISTANCE TO 
INTERROGATION AND THAT NONE OF 
THE NORMAL METHODS WERE WORKING 
AND SO THE INTELLIGENCE GROUP 
WANTED TO TRY MORE AGGRESSIVE 
TECHNIQUES 
INFORMATION WAS NEEDED TECHNIQUES OUT OF THESE PEOPLE NEW 
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES WERE 
NEEDED WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE 
MY ROLE 
WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY 
WANTED TO DO AND SEE WHAT THE LAW 
ALLOWED 
IN THEIR DOWN TIME THE ALLOWED GUANTANAMO INTERROGATORS WATCHED 
CABLE T. V. FAVOURITE SHOW WAS TWENTY FOUR 
WHERE JACK BAUER A 
COUNTERTERRORISM AGENT HAS HIS OWN 
RESPONSE TO THOSE WHO WON'T ANSWER 
HIS QUESTIONS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE 
GET A 
HELICOPTER TEAM AND BACKUP TEAM 
READY TO LEAVE HERE IN FIFTEEN MINUTES 
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND 
YOU WANT 
TO FIND THIS BOMB THIS IS WHAT 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE 
KILLING A 
WITNESS 
THAT'S PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE WITNESS LIKE YOU YOU WANT RESULTS BUT YOU 
DON'T WANT TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY 
ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES 
I WAS TOLD TWENTY FOUR 
HAD MANY FRIENDS IN GUANTANAMO BAY 
THE TIMING IS INTERESTING THE 
SECOND SERIES OF TWENTY FOUR WENT TO AIR 
RIGHT AT THE END OF OCTOBER AT THE 
VERY MOMENT THESE DECISIONS WERE 
BEING TAKEN 
THE CLIMATE WAS FEBRILE DIANE 
BEAVER AN ORDINARY ARMY LAWYER 
PRESENTED WITH THAT POST GENEVA 
BLANK PAPER HAD TO DECIDE HOW FAR 
GUANTANAMO'S INTERROGATORS COULD GO 
I COULDN'T JUST SAY OH THIS IS 
UNCOMFORTABLE OR UNPLEASANT OR 
GOSH THIS IS REALLY TOUGH I'M NOT 
GOING TO DO IT DID SEEK GUIDANCE 
FROM MY TECHNICAL CHAIN WHICH 
AGAIN IS CHAIRMANS LEGAL AND WHEN 
NONE WAS FORTHCOMINGS I TOOK MY 
SUBORDINATES AND WE BASICALLY IN 
FOUR DAY PERIOD THEN WROTE THE 
LEGAL OPINION THAT WAS LATER 
RELEASED ON JUNE TWENTY SECOND TWO THOUSAND FOUR AT A 
WHITE HOUSE PRESS CONFERENCE WHAT WHAT CAME OUT WAS THIS NOW NOTORIOUS 
MEMO SIGNED BY DONALD RUMSFELD THE 
SECRETARY APPROVING 
DEFENCE SECRETARY APPROVING DEPRIVATION OF LIGHT AND AUDITORY 
STEM LIE USING DETAINEES' 
INDIVIDUAL PHOBIAS SUCH AS FEAR OF 
DOGS AND USE OF WET TOWEL AND 
DRIPPING WATER TO INDIES THE 
MISPERCEPTION OF SUFFOCATING 
ALL A 
PRODUCT OF DIANE BEAVER AND HER 
TEAM AT GUANTANAMO RUMSFELD SIGNED 
OFF ON THESE SO CALLED STRESS 
TECHNIQUES WRITING I STAND FOR 
EIGHT TO TEN HOURS A DAY WHY IS 
STANDING LIMITED TO FOUR HOURS 
THE WAY THINGS WORKED OUT IT WENT 
IN THE END FROM YOU RIGHT TO 
RUMSFELD ALMOST UNINTERRUPTED 
NOBODY ELSE LOOKED AT THIS PROPERLY 
NOBODY WANTED TO TOUCH IT IT IT APPEARS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED BUT 
AS IT TURNS OUT I'M THE ONLY ONE 
WHO WROTE A LEGAL OPINION WHICH 
SURPRISED ME BUT WHEN YOU ARE IN 
THE SITUATION AT THE BOTTOM YOU'RE 
JUST GOING DAY TO DAY SO I HAD NO 
IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON ABOVE ME 
AND AGAIN NO ONE TOLD ME ANYTHING 
SO 
WHY DO YOU THINK NOBODY ELSE SO WAS OFFERING A LEGAL OPINION ON 
THIS 
I REALLY CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM THIS YOU'D HAVE TO ASK THEM L. JUST KNOW 
THAT I WAS LEFT WHAT I FELT WAS 
ON THE TINY END OF THE LIMB AND IT 
WAS YOU KNOW COMING OFF BEHIND ME 
SENIOR LAWYERS FROM THE 
ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING DAVID 
ATINGTON KNOWN AS DICK CHENEY'S 
RASPUTIN AND ALBERTO GONZALEZ 
LATER TO BECOME ATTORNEY GENERAL 
MADE A FLYING VISIT TO GUANTANAMO 
I WAS GLAD THAT SENIOR 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WERE 
INTERESTED IN WHAT WE WERE DOING 
IT GAVE THE STAMP OF AUTHORITY AND 
APPROVAL BASICALLY 
I MEAN WHEN 
SOMEBODY OF THAT STATURE COMES TO 
VISIT YOU AND AND THEY LEAVE YOU 
WITH THE MESSAGE OF YOU'RE NOT 
DOING THIS IN A VACUUM 
A LEAKED 
INTERROGATION LOG OF GUANTANAMO 
DETAINEE OH SIX THREE SHOWS HOW HE WAS 
QUESTIONED OVER FIFTY FOUR DAYS UNDER THE 
NEW RULES AMONG OTHER THINGS HE 
WAS HOODED SHACKLED AND CUFFED 
DEPRIVED OF SLEEP SUBJECTED TO 
EXTREMES OF COLD MADE TO STAND 
NAKED SEXUALLY HUMILIATED AND 
THREATENED WITH DOGS DIANE BEAVER 
SAYS WITH THE PRESIDENT'S 
WITHDRAWAL OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE 
BRIGHT LINES OF GENEVA ALL THIS 
BECAME POSSIBLE 
IT'S NOT MY 
PERSONAL MORALS IN TERMS OF HOW YOU 
JUDGE THE SITUATION IT'S THE LAW 
AND THE LAW ALLOWED QUITE A BIT 
WHILE DIANE BEAVER'S LEGAL ADVICE 
WAS APPARENTLY WITHDRAWN IN TWO THOUSAND THREE 
IT WAS JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIX BEFORE THE U. S. 
SUPREME COURT RULED THAT ALL 
GUANTANAMO DETAINEES WERE ENTITLED 
TO THE PROTECTIONS OF THE GENEVA 
CONVENTION THE PRESIDENT HAD ACTED 
UNLAWFULLY MR. BUSH THEN GRANTED 
THOSE WHO HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THE 
INTERROGATIONS DOMESTIC IMMUNITY 
THIS IT'S CLAIMED CREATES ANOTHER 
PROBLEM IT LEAVES INTERROGATORS 
AND LAWYERS VULNERABLE TO 
INTERNATIONAL PROSECUTION FOR ANY 
ALLEGED ABUSES OF DETAINEES 
PHILIPPE SANDS IS AN EXPERT IN 
INTERNATIONAL LAW 
THERE'S AN 
ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE THAT AND 
IT'S A VERY SENSIBLE PRINCIPLE 
THAT IT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST FOR 
THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE ACT 
OCCURRED PRINCIPALLY TO INVESTIGATE 
AND IF NECESSARY PROSECUTE IF THE 
DOMESTIC JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES HAS CLOSED OFF THAT 
POSSIBILITY BY APPARENTLY CREATING 
A BLANKET OF WATER TIGHT IMMUNITY 
THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE WOULD SAY AN 
INCENTIVE BUT AN OBLIGATION FOR 
OTHERS TO INVESTIGATE THE THE PRECEDENT IS NUREMBERG WHERE JOSEPH 
L. STUTTER WAS THE FIRST LAWYER 
DEFENDANT DOCUMENTS FROM HIS TRIAL 
SHOW HOW ITATE ALL STARTED WITH 
SIGNING LEGAL PAPERS IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR SAYING 
HE COULDN'T REVEAL WHERE JEWS HAD 
BEEN DEPORTED HE CITED SECURITY 
REASONS PHILIPPE SANDS SAYS THE 
BUSH ADMINISTRATION ALSO CITED 
SECURITY REASONS FOR DITCHING 
GENEVA AND FOR THE ALLEGED ABUSES 
THAT FOLLOWED 
I AM NOT FOR A 
MOMENT SAYING THAT THE ACTIONS OF 
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ARE 
ANALOGOUS TO THE ACTIONS OF THE 
THIRD REICH ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT I 
AM INTERESTED IN IS THE ANALOGY OF 
PRINCIPLE 
IT'S A PRINCIPLE WHICH PRINCIPLE COULD LEAVE SOME SENIOR 
ADMINISTRATION FIGURES IN JEOPARDY 
IF THEY TRAVEL ABROAD DIANE BEAVER 
THE MILITARY LAWYER LEFT EXPOSED AT 
THE BOTTOM OF THE CHAIN SAYS FOR 
HER PART SHE WAS DOING HER DUTY 
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OTHERS 
LOOKED AT IT AND MADE THE DECISION 
AND THE PRESIDENT ISSUED THE ORDER 
AND SO FOR ME THE COMMANDER IN 
CHIEF ISSUED THAT ORDER AND IT WAS 
FOR ME TO FOLLOW 
THAT WAS DIANE 
BEAVER TALKING TO PETER MARSHAL 
DAVID RIFKIN IS A FORMER WHITE 
HOUSE LEGAL ADVISOR AND HE JOINS 
US FROM WASHINGTON DAVID RIFKIN 
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US 
HERE IS A JUNIOR LAWYER WHO WAS 
BASICALLY GIVEN THE JOB OF DECIDING 
WHAT INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES WERE 
ALLOWED IT'S ASTONISHING ISN'T 
IT 
IT'S NOT I WOULD SAY THE IT WHOLE ACCOUNT ABOUT HOW THE ADVICE 
BY THE MORE SENIOR LAWYERS RELATIVE 
TO APPLICABILITY TO GENEVA RELATES 
TO THE PERMISSIBLE INTERROGATION 
TECHNIQUES LET'S JUST SAY IT'S NOT 
AS SIMPLE AND CLEAR CUT AS PHILIPPE 
SANDS HAS ALLEGED IN HIS ARTICLE 
WHICH I HAVE READ WITH INTEREST 
LOOK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE 
WHO IN GOOD FAITH WERE TRYING TO 
WRESTLE A VERY DIFFICULT 
UNPRECEDENTED LEGAL ISSUE THE 
GREAT THING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES 
ED A I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU WE'RE 
ONE OF THE VERY FEW COUNTRIES WHO 
DO THAT IS PEOPLE LAWYERS ASK 
DIFFICULT QUESTIONS AND SKETCH 
ANSWERS THAT MAY BE DISPLEASING TO 
SOME BUT DOING IT IN GOOD FAITH TO 
TRY COME UP WITH THE LEGAL 
PARAMETERS THERE'S NOTHING WRONG 
WITH THAT L. WOULD RATHER DO THAT 
THAN HAVE PEOPLE I WOULD VERY 
MUCH DOUBT FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE 
FRENCH GOVERNMENT ASKED FOR LEGAL 
ADVICE WHEN THEY WENT AND BLEW UP 
THE RAINBOW WARRIOR WHICH WAS A 
GREENPEACE SHIP IN NEW ZEALAND 
LET'S GO BACK TO THIS POINT IT 
WASN'T JUST PHILIPPE SANDS SHE WAS 
THE LAWYER WHO WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO 
WROTE LEGAL OPINION SHE WAS AT 
THE BOTTOM OF THE WRUNG AND THAT 
WENT STRAIGHT TO RUMSFELD WHO 
SIGNED IT OFF AS SHE SAID SHE WAS 
LEFT ON A TINY END OF THE LIMB 
HUNG OUT TO DRY 
THAT'S MANIFESTLY 
UNTRUE IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER 
DOCUMENTS THERE WAS A TASK FORCE 
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE 
CHAIRED BY A NUMBER OF SENIOR 
LAWYERS THERE WERE LEGAL MEMOS 
BEYOND THE MEMO OF APPLICABILITY 
WITH GENEVA CONVENTIONS THAT DEALT 
WITH PERMISSIBLE PARAMETERS OF 
TECHNIQUES PHILIPPE SANDS MAKES 
HER OUT TO BE THE ONLY PERSON 
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE THE BIG 
PICTURE IS THIS THERE WERE 
UNFORTUNATE ABUSES IN MY OPINION 
AND IN EVERY INDEPENDENT COMMISSION 
THAT LOOKED AT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO 
WITH POLICY CUTS WHAT PHILIPPE 
SANDS 
DO S. 
IT LINKS YEAH TO 
YEAH TO AL QAEDA WHICH BY THE WAY IN MY 
OPINION ABSOLUTELY CORRECT BECAUSE 
IT'S NOT STATE IT'S NOT A STATE 
PARTY AND UNFORTUNATE THINGS THAT 
HAPPENED IN ABU GRHAIB AND 
GUANTANAMO 
EXTRAORDINARY THAT THE GUANTANAMO U. S. SUPREME COURT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX SAID 
THE GENEVA CONVENTION DID APPLY 
AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE WRITTEN TODAY 
IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL TO THE 
EXTENT INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN BE 
MADE IT'S MADE THROUGH ACTUAL STATE 
PRACTISE WHAT KIND OF RULES DOES 
THAT SET YOU NOTHING 
NO EACH 
STATE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ACTING IN 
GOOD FAITH AND CONSTRUPT IN 
FLESHING OUT IT'S IN THE NATIONAL 
LEGAL OBLIGATION TRUST ME I HAVE 
READ THE DECISION YOU'RE TALKING 
ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT DID NOT 
COME ANYWHERE CLOSE TO SAYING THE 
GENEVA CONVENTIONS QUOTE APPLIED 
FOR ALL PURPOSES TO THE DETAINEES 
OF GUANTANAMO BAY THE HUMDUM 
DECISION HAD TO DO WITH ONE NARROW 
ISSUE HOW TO STRUCTURE THE 
WORKINGS OF MILITARY COMMISSIONS 
THERE IS JUST SO MUCH INFORMATION 
AND FACTS AND NUANCES MATTER A 
GREAT DEAL IN LAW 
I GUESS WE'LL 
HAVE TO AGREE THE DIFFER ON THAT 
ONE POINT WE HAVE RUN OUT OF TIME 
BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
PHILIPPE SANDS WHO YOU SAW IN THAT 
PIECE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ON 
GUANTANAMO TORTURE TEAM IS THE 
LATEST ADDITION TO THE NEWSNIGHT 
BOOK CLUB YOU CAN READ AN ABSTRACT 
ON IT AND COMMENT IT ON THE WEBSITE 
IT'S NOT AS IF WE SHOULD NEED A 
ROUND NUMBER TO TALK ABOUT THE 
SITUATION IN DARFUR BUT IF WE DO 
IT'S HERE THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
WAS TOLD THE DEATH TOLL HAS RISEN 
TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY LOOKED ON 
THE SITUATION IN RWANDA AND SWORE 
NOTHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED 
TO HAPPEN AGAIN SOME WOULD SAY 
NOTHING WE ASKED ROBIN DENSELOW 
WHO HAS BEEN TO DARFUR WHO 
REFLECTED ON THE EVENTS OF THE LAST 
FIVE YEARS 
YOU MAY FIND SOME OF THE IMAGES IN 
HIS REPORT DISTURBING 
FIVE YEARS ON AND THE END IS STILL 
NOT IN SIGHT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE 
NOW DIED IN THE DARFUR CONFLICT 
ACCORDING TO A UN ESTIMATE OTHERS 
PUT THE FIGURE AT HALF A MILLION 
OR THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT INSIST 
ONLY TEN THOUSAND HAVE BEEN KILLED A 
FURTHER TWENTY FIVE TO THREE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN DIRECTLY AFFECTED MOST HAVE 
BEEN FORCED TO FLEE THEIR HOMES 
AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE FOOD 
THEY NEED DARFUR IS AN AREA THE 
SIZE OF FRANCE OUT IN THE WEST OF 
SUDAN IT'S HOME TO BOTH ARAB AND 
NON ARAB GROUPS AND THE CONFLICT 
STARTED AS A DISPUTE INVOLVING RACE 
AND LAND BETWEEN NOMADS AND FARMERS 
REBELS ATTACKED GOVERNMENT TARGETS 
CLAIMING THERE WAS DISCRIMINATION 
IN FAVOUR OF THE ARABS AND THE 
GOVERNMENT HIT BACK USING THE ARMY 
AND THE RENEGADE JANJAWEED MILITIAS 
ACCUSED OF MURDER DESTRUCTION AND 
RAPE 
THEY JUST USED RAPE LIKE A RAPE KIND OF WEAPON LIKE A KIND OF WAR 
LIKE JUST BECAUSE FOR WHEN THE 
WAR IS STARTING IN DARFUR THEY 
JUST STARTED RAPING THEY JUST 
RAPING WOMEN 
THE OUTSIDE WORLD SLOWLY BECAME 
INVOLVED IN JULY TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE UN 
SECURITY COUNCIL DEMANDED THAT THE 
SUDANESE GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONCERN 
THE JANJAWEED AND ENDORSE THE 
AFRICAN UNION DEPLOYMENT OF 
MONITORS AND PROTECTION FORCE TO 
DARFUR THE KILLING AND DESTRUCTION 
CONTINUED AND THOSE FORCED FROM 
THEIR VILLAGES FLED OVER THE BORDER 
TO CHAD OR THE MAKE SHIFT CAMPS 
WITHIN DARFUR ITSELF 
IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOUR I VISITED 
DARFUR WITH A NEWSNIGHT TEAM WOE 
FOUND VILLAGES STILL BEING BURNED 
AND IN THE TOWN OF TINA UP NEAR THE 
BORDER THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF 
TWENTY THOUSAND HAD FLED FROM THE ATTACKS 
AND MOVED OVER TO CHAD LEAVING THE 
AFRICAN UNION TROOPS GUARDING AN 
EMPTY TOWN WITH MAJOR PROBLEMS 
WHEN WE VISITED THEY WERE CUT OFF 
BECAUSE THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT HAD 
BLOCKED FUEL SUPPLIES TO THE 
HELICOPTERS THERE HAVE BEEN A 
SERIES OF PEACE TALKS IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE TWO THOUSAND SIX 
AND AGAIN LAST YEAR BUT THE PEACE 
DEALS GOT NO WHERE AND THE REBELS 
WERE INCREASINGLY DIVIDED IF IF VIOLENCE AND FEAR PREVENT THE 
PEOPLE OF DARFUR FROM PLANTING AND 
GROWING THEIR CROPS NEXT YEAR THEN
