WHAT AN AFTERNOON IT COULD ALL 
CHANGE ROUND RELEGATION WISE IF 
BOLTON 
OR FULHAM 
WIN IT COULD 
CHANGE 
THE COMPLEXION 
OF THINGS I 
I AND THOSE 
RESULTS YOU 
WOULD NOT 
AND THOSE RESULTS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE PREDICTED AWAY 
FROM HOME 
AND YET TODAY THEY 
COULD HAVE HAD 
MORE GOALS 
IF 
MCBRIDE HAD BEEN FIT FOR A BIGGER 
PART 
OF THE 
SEASON 
VERY LIVELY 
AS WELL IF THEY HAD 
THAT THEY 
WOULD NOT BE IN THAT TROUBLE IT WILL GET WORSE FOR TROUBLE BIRMINGHAM AS WELL 
SCORE AT SAINT ANDREWS 
THAT'S RIGHT 
BIRMINGHAM WOULD HAVE BEEN A BIGGER 
THREAT EVERTON HAVE BEEN A BIT 
LACKLUSTRE KEVIN DAVIES HAS BEEN 
AN INSPIRATION FOR THEM HE HAS 
SCORED THE GOAL HIT THE POST AS 
WELL HE HAS BEEN A TALISMANIC 
FIGURE FOR THEM 
THE LAST FEW WEEKS 
IT HAS LOOKED LIKE BOLTON AND 
FULHAM HAVE NOT HAD ANY CHANCE IF 
THEY BOTH 
WIN TODAY WE 
WILL BE 
STARTING TO SAY 
THEY ARE 
GETTING 
OUT OF TROUBLE 
IT IS AS IF REALITY 
HAS DAWNED ON BOTH OF THESE TEAMS 
FULHAM HAS PLAYED WITH A FREEDOM 
NOW EVERTON HAS SCORED 
A DAY MIAN 
JOHNSON WATCHING 
YOU WERE TEMPTING FATE EVERTON 
HAVE SCORED IT IS LESCOTT HE HAS 
BEEN SUCH A BIG CONTRIBUTOR OF 
GOALS FOR EVERTON THIS SEASON 
LESCOTT GOT THE FINAL TOUCH OVER 
THE DEFENDERS 
M. K. DONS ARE GOING TO BE PROMOTED 
THIS AFTERNOON IT WOULD APPEAR 
BIRMINGHAM ARE RIGHT BACK IN 
TROUBLE ONLY A POINT AWAY FROM 
RELEGATION 
YAKUBU PUT IT BACK INTO RELEGATION THE BOX AREA THEN LESCOTT GET THE 
FINAL TOUCH LEAVES BIRMINGHAM ON 
THIRTY POINTS BUT AS IT STANDS BOLTON 
AROUND TWENTY NINE AND FULHAM ON TWENTY SEVEN SO THE 
GAP IS CLOSING 
FULHAM ARE THREE 
POINTS FROM SAFETY NOW THE 
CONFIDENCE THAT WILL BREED WITHIN 
THE CAMP I CANNOT QUITE BELIEVE IT 
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I HAD THIS SORT 
OF LAST 
WEEK BUT 
NOW 
I AM 
NOT SURE 
HE WAS GOING DOWN 
FULHAM SHOULD BE 
BEATING THEM THREE AND FOUR THAT HAS GOT 
TO BE WON FOR 
STEVE COPPELL 
AT HOME 
SUCH AN IMPORTANT GOAL 
AND THEY 
HAVE NOT TURNED UP TODAY 
NO S. P. L. GAMES TODAY HE WAS AN 
INCREDIBLE GAME OF FOOTBALL 
AN 
EXTRAORDINARY GAIN AN EXTRAORDINARY RESULT QUEEN OF THE 
SOUTH SCORED THREE TIMES ABERDEEN 
LEVELLED THREE TIMES UNTIL FINALLY 
THE QUEEN OF THE SOUTH DEFENCE WERE 
ABLE TO SHUT UP SHOP AND HOLD OUT 
TOSH OPENED THE SCORING IN THE 
FIRST HALF THE REST OF THE 
UNDERDOGS GOALS WERE SCORED AT THE 
START OF THE SECOND PERIOD THE 
GOAL FROM STUART PROVED DECISIVE 
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR 
HISTORY QUEEN OF THE SOUTH AARON 
THE SCOTTISH CUP FINAL 
HE DOES RANGERS VERSUS PARTICK 
TOMORROW THE WINNERS WILL PLAY SAINT 
JOHNSTONE AND THE OTHER SEMI FINAL 
WITH RANGERS THROUGH TO THE FINAL 
OF THE CUP THEY ARE IN WITH 
CHANCE OF WINNING FOUR TROPHIES 
HAMILTON HAVE TO WIN SECOND PLACED 
DUNDEE LOSE WE ARE FOLLOWING THE 
HAMILTON END OF THINGS NO HAMILTON 
PROMOTION THIS WEEK BUT NOW BOTH 
SIDES ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE 
FINAL WHISTLE 
WITH DUNDEE WINNING IT WILL NOT BE 
HAPPENING THIS AFTERNOON FOR 
HAMILTON TO THE STADIUM OF LIGHT 
A GOAL IT HAS GONE TO MANCHESTER CITY A PENALTY IN THE SEVENTY EIGHT T. H. MINUTE 
A TACKLE FROM NOSWORTHY HE WAS 
DISTRAUGHT IT WAS AWARDED AM NOT 
CONVINCED THERE WAS ANY CONTACT 
BETWEEN NOSWORTHY AND STURRIDGE MR. 
REILLY THOUGHT OTHERWISE AND 
ARELLANO CONVERTED THE PENALTY 
SOME LOOK SUNDERLAND WILL NOT GO 
DOWN I KNOW THE MATHS STILL COUNT 
BUT THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN WHEN IT 
DESPITE A DEFEAT TODAY 
NO THE 
TEAMS BELOW THEM HAVE TOO MUCH 
GROUND TO MAKE UP BUT THE PENALTY 
WAS A VERY INTERESTING ONE THAT 
LOOKED LIKE NOSWORTHY WAS CLUMSY 
IF BIRMINGHAM GET BEATEN THIS 
AFTERNOON HOW DID THEY PICK 
THEMSELVES UP FOR THE REMAINDER OF 
THE SEASON 
THEY HAVE SOME 
DIFFICULT GAMES AS WELL THEY HAVE 
GOT LIVERPOOL BLACKBURN AT HOME A 
BIG MATCH AGAINST VILLA AWAY 
WEEK SO 
THEY HAVE SOME TOUGH TIMES 
AHEAD 
A FULHAM GAME IN TWO GAMES AHEAD TIME IS MASSIVE NOW 
THE IT'S TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE 
COCA COLA CHAMPIONSHIP WEST BROM 
AGAINST WATFORD FIRST AGAINST 
FIFTH KICKS OFF AT FIVE TWENTY P. M. SO TIGHT 
FOR THE AUTOMATIC PROMOTION PLACES 
BRISTOL CITY PLAYING WELL FIGHTING 
FOR A PLAY OFF PLACE 
I THINK THIS ONE SUMS UP THIS 
SEASON'S CHAMPIONSHIP NEITHER SIDE 
CAN LAND THE KNOCKOUT BLOW WILL IT 
LOOK MORE LIVELY THE WOLVES 
STEVE BARKER HAS TWICE BEEN OFF 
TARGET TARGET STOKES BID TO RETURN TO THE TOP 
FLIGHT OF ENGLISH FOOTBALL FOR THE 
FIRST TIME SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE HAS TAKEN 
THEM TO COVENTRY WHO CANNOT BE 
SURE OF DROPPING DOWN INTO THE 
THIRD TIA 
STOKE CITY ARE ONE STEP NEARER TO 
RETURNING TO THE TOP FLIGHT IN TWENTY THREE 
YEARS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TAKEN THE 
LEAD AGAINST COVENTRY A TERRIFIC 
CROSS AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE BOX 
LAWRENCE MADE NO MISTAKES SMASHING 
THE BALL PAST SCHMEICHEL ALL THIS 
AFTER STOKE CITY HAD BEEN DOWN 
THEY CAME BACK INTO IT IN 
THRILLING SECOND HALF A TERRIFIC 
PENALTY FROM FULHAM 
GOALS BEING SCORED ALL ROUND THE 
COUNTRY BACK TO THE STADIUM OF 
LIGHT IT IS ONE ONE WHITEHEAD WITH 
THE REPLY JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES 
AFTER CITY HAD CONVERTED A PENALTY 
THE BALL WAS CROSSED FROM THE LEFT 
SIDE AND WHITE HEAD WITH A SIDE 
FOOT VOLLEY THUNDERED INTO THE BACK 
OF THE NET 
LET SPRINT TO SAINT ANDREWS WHERE 
THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER GOAL 
BIRMINGHAM HAVE THE EQUALIZER THAT 
THEY DESERVE ON 
THEIR DOMINATION OF 
THE PLAY SO FAR CARSLEY CONCEDED 
THE FREE KICK ON THE EDGE OF THE 
AREA FOR HANDBALL THE SCORER 
CONVERTED AND CURLED THE BALL 
BALL INTO THE NET 
ONE COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE IT 
COULD MEAN EVERYTHING TO THEM THE 
GOAL SCORER HAS BEEN LIVE WIRE 
FOR THEM IN RECENT WEEKS THAT IS 
CRUCIAL OPENS THE IT UP FOR THEM A 
LITTLE MORE AND GIVE THEM BREATHING 
SPACE NOW THEY HAVE THE MOMENTUM 
AND LOOK LIKELY TO WIN 
IT IS 
DAMAGE LIMITATION BECAUSE 
THIS GAME 
AGAINST EVERTON IS THE CHANCE TO 
GET 
THREE POINTS 
AND 
GET UP THERE 
WITH A SAFETY POINT YES BUT ALEX 
YES BUT ALEX MCLEISH WILL BE REASONABLY PLEASED 
WITH THEIR PERFORMANCE IT WAS A 
SHOCK TO SEE THEM GOING BEHIND 
REALLY WHEN YOU DO GO A GOAL DOWN 
AND YOU ARE IN THAT POSITION YOU 
LOOK FOR A RESPONSE AND EVENTUALLY 
ALEX MCLEISH GOT THAT 
FOR FULHAM 
WE CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE WHAT THIS 
WOULD BE FULL FULHAM AND WHAT IT 
WOULD DO TO READING AS WELL 
BECAUSE SUDDENLY THEY ARE BACK IN 
IT YES 
IT THEIR LIVES THEY ARE CURRENTLY ON 
THIRTY TWO POINT BOLTON ARE WINNING SO IT 
IS GETTING VERY TASTY NOW 
IT IS 
NOT VERY AMUSING FOR DERBY FANS 
THIS SEASON AND IT KEEPS GOING FROM 
BAD TO WORSE AND EVEN WORSE

RUN TO NINE GAMES A SIXTH 
SUCCESSIVE AWAY DEFEAT FOR

QUITE AN AFTERNOON ALL SCUNTHORPE THE RESULTS ARE JUST ABOUT IN 
PLANNED TO CONFIRM THE FINAL SCORES 
TIME TO CONFIRM 
WE WILL HEAR THE THOUGHTS OF OUR 
GUESTS IN THE MINUTES TO COME 
REACTION FROM MANAGERS AND PLAYERS 
IS COMING UP IN THE LIGHT OF THE 
TOP FOOTBALL STORIES OF THE DAY 
FULHAM PULL HER AWAY WIN DROUGHT TO 
KEEP HOPES OF SURVIVAL ALIVE AND 
PAUL READING DEEPER INTO THE 
RELEGATION SCRAP 
KEVIN DAVIES SCORED A PRICELESS 
SECOND HALF WINNER AS BOLTON FIGHT 
FOR SURVIVAL 
A FREE KICK RESCUED A VITAL POINT 
FOR BIRMINGHAM THEY ARE NOW JUST 
TWO POINTS ABOVE THE DROP ZONE 
JUST WHEN DERBY FANS THOUGHT THEIR 
SEASON COULD NOT GET ANY WORSE 
THEY WERE HIT SIX AT PRIDE PARK 
SUNDERLAND'S WINNING STREAK COMES 
TO AN 
TO AN 
END FOR ONCE IT IS A LOW 
SCORING GAME AT TOTTENHAM THEY 
SHARE THE POINTS WITH MIDDLESBROUGH 
AT WHITE HART LANE MIDDLESBROUGH 
HAVE NOW DRAWN FOUR OF THEIR LAST 
SIX GAMES ALL THE GAMES WILL BE 
SHOWN IN MATCH OF THE DAY AT 
TEN THIRTY P. M. 
IT HAS BEEN QUITE AN AFTERNOON A 
FEW WEEKS AGO EVEN LAST WEEK WE 
SAID BOLTON AND FULHAM WERE 
STRUGGLING TO GET ANY CHANCE OF 
STAYING UP IT HAS COMPLETELY 
CHANGED AROUND NOW 
THAT IS 
FOOTBALL FOR YOU BOLTON AND 
UNDESERVED THEIR VICTORIES FALLEN 
IN PARTICULAR IF HODGSON IS GOING 
TO SURVIVE HE HAS GOT TO CONTINUE 
WITH HE ME BULLARD AND MCBRIDE 
BECAUSE THOSE THREE SEEMED TO 
TRANSFORM THEIR PERFORMANCE AND 
THEY ARE ALL FIT DAVID HEALY 
WHAT WAS AT THE HEART OF BOLTON'S 
WIN TODAY THEY COULD NOT GET 
GOAL FROM ANYWHERE BUT THEY 
TO HAVE SOMETHING IN THEIR 
PERFORMANCE TODAY 
I THINK THE MAIN 
PERFORMER TODAY WAS KEVIN DAVIES 
HE COULD HAVE SCORED A HAT TRICK 
QUITE EASILY TODAY HE'S GOT 
PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THE GAME AND HE 
WAS A LEADER TODAY 
IT COULD HAVE 
BEEN WORSE FOR BIRMINGHAM WHEN THEY 
CONCEDED A GOAL TO EVERTON IN THE 
SECOND HALF IT WAS SEVEN MINUTES 
FROM TIME THEY EQUALISED 
AND SO 
RATTY WAS THE MAN TO DO IT THEY 
ARE FIGHTING AWAY AND IT HAS BECOME 
TIGHTER NOW BUT I STILL SAY THAT I 
THINK FULHAM ARE RUNNING OUT OF 
GAMES AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKELY 
THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN SO MUCH 
CONFIDENCE 
THEY LOST AT HOME TODAY CONFIDENCE AGAINST A SIDE THEY WOULD HAVE 
EXPECTED 
TO BEAT IF THEY WERE GOING 
THEY HAVE 
NOT DONE IT 
IT SENDS 
A VERY BAD 
MESSAGE TO 
THE 
FANS ARE 
THEY GOOD 
ENOUGH TO STAY 
IN THIS 
LEAGUE WE WILL HAVE TO 
WAIT AND SEE 
BIRMINGHAM ARE TWO 
POINTS AWAY FROM THE RELEGATION 
PLACES HERE IS THEIR MANAGER 
WHEN YOU TAKE THAT TODAY HAVING 
BEEN A GOAL BEHIND YES IN THE END 
WE DID REALLY WELL AND THE SECOND 
HALF WE HAD SOME NEAR THINGS AND I 
THOUGHT IT WAS 
NOT GOING 
TO BE OUR 
DAY IN 
FRONT OF THE 
GOAL WE 
DEFENDED WELL BUT 
WHENEVER WE 
WENT 
AHEAD I 
THOUGHT IT 
WAS A CRUEL 
BUT WE NEVER GAVE 
UP AND 
WE KEPT 
ENCOURAGING THE PLAYERS FROM THE 
SIDELINES OUR GOALSCORER GOT US AN 
EQUALISER AND THAT COULD KEEPER 
WAS IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE SO THAT 
IS WHY 
THE PLAYERS 
SHOULD GO INTO 
THE NEXT 
GAME WITH CONFIDENCE 
BECAUSE THEY PLAYED WELL TODAY 
HAVING LOST LARSSON AND FORSSELL TO 
INJURY PRETTY UNFORTUNATE 
CIRCUMSTANCES DID YOU FEEL IT 
WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE AGAIN 
RESOURCES WILL ALWAYS GET TESTED 
WE 
HAVE GOT 
A SMALL SQUAD AND I 
KEEP SAYING IT IS QUITE BENT UNDER 
EXPERIENCED SQUAD WE HAVE ONE OR 
TWO OLD CAMPAIGN YEARS 
CAMPAIGNERS IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
AND AGAIN I CANNOT FAULT OUR 
PERFORMANCE AT SAINT ANDREWS WE COULD 
DO WITH MORE QUALITY IN CERTAIN 
PARTS OF THE GAME MAYBE DELIVERY 
AT THE FRONT COVER IN FRONT OF 
GOALS OR WHATEVER AND WE DEFENDED 
NERVOUSLY ON WATER OCCASIONS BUT 
OTHER THAN THAT THE RESILIENCE THEY 
PUT IN WAS FABULOUS 
AND YET YOUR 
SIDE DISPLAYED THE GREATEST AT A 
QUALITY THROUGH THE YOUNGEST 
ON THE PITCH IT SEEMS 
HE CANNOT 
DO 
ANYTHING WRONG RIGHT NOW 
I BROUGHT 
JAMES MCFADDEN BACK FOR HIS 
EXPERIENCE AND IT WAS GOOD TO HAVE 
HIM BACK YOU SEE THE TALENT BUT HE 
HAS AND WE HAVE A TRIED AND TRUSTED 
STRIKER IN MIKAEL FORSSELL THEIR 
PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN GOOD WE WILL 
NOT GET TOO CARRIED AWAY AND PUT 
THEM UNDER TOO MUCH PRESSURE BUT 
THE KID IS 
BURSTING TO 
PLAY HE WAS 
DISAPPOINTED WHEN 
I SAID HE 
BE ON THE BENCH 
BUT WE 
EXPECT THAT 
BECAUSE 
HE HAS 
GOT A 
BIG HEART 
AND 
HE IS 
A TERRIFIC 
PLAYER 
THERE IS BIRMINGHAM'S REMAINING 
FIXTURES HOW MANY POINTS WILL THEY 
GET GARTH 
WHICH LIVERPOOL WILL 
TURN UP AT SAINT ANDREWS ON THE TWENTY SIX T. H. 
WHO IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A SMITH 
OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TAKE 
PRIORITY WITH LIVERPOOL AND 
BIRMINGHAM WILL BE PUTTING 
LOOKING AT THAT 
FULHAM MAY WELL 
GIVE THEMSELVES THE CHANCE SO THEY 
COULD BE FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS I I THINK THEY WILL PROBABLY GET A 
POINT AGAINST VILLA LOSE AGAINST 
LIVERPOOL AND THEN IT WILL COME 
DOWN TO THE GAME 
AT FULHAM 
I 
I CANNOT 
SEE THEM 
PICKING ANYTHING UP 
AGAINST FULHAM THEY ARE BACK INTO 
SOME DECENT FORM 
NOW THEY 
HAVE 
JUST ROUTED 
DERBY I 
THINK YOU ARE 
RIGHT WITH THE LIVERPOOL THING 
DERBY LOST SIX ZERO AT HOME TODAY 
DIFFICULT TO TALK TO PEOPLE AFTER 
THAT BUT 
HERE IS THEIR MANAGER 
IF I SUPPOSE SO SHORT A TIME AFTER 
A SIX ZERO 
HOME DEFEAT 
IT MUST BE 
DIFFICULT TO 
ANALYSE A PERFORMANCE 
LIKE THAT 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
LIKE THAT ACCEPT 
A PERFORMANCE 
LIKE THAT IT 
IS STRANGE BECAUSE FOR TWENTY MINUTES 
WE PLAYED 
VERY WELL AS 
SOON AS 
WE WENT A 
GOAL DOWN 
IT MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN A 
BALE 
I DON'T KNOW 
BUT IT 
WAS LIKE A 
DECK OF 
CARDS AND IT 
COLLAPSED IT 
HAS BEEN THE 
SAME ALL 
SEASON LONG IT IS HORRIBLE 
SITUATION WE ARE IN IT WAS 
UNCOMFORTABLE TO SAY THE LEAST AS AS YOU SAY THE FIRST TWENTY MINUTES YOU 
WERE ON TOP TO 
CONCEDE TWO 
GOALS 
IN A 
SHORT SPACE 
OF TIME IT 
KNOCK THE STUFFING OUT 
OF THE 
BEST 
OF TIMES WOULDN'T IT 
IT IN 
KNOCKED THE STUFFING OUT OF US 
THAT IS FOR SURE WE HAVE GOT TO 
RALLY THE TROOPS AND GET SOME GOOD 
QUALITY PLAYERS THAT WHEN THE GOING 
GETS TOUGH THEY CAN ROLL THEIR 
SLEEVES UP AT THE END OF THE DAY 
IF FOR THE FIRST TWENTY MINUTES WE 
PLAYED 
WELL AND 
THEN WE COULD NOT 
GET NEAR 
THEM BUT UP 
UNTIL THEN 
THERE WAS NOTHING 
IN THE 
GAME IN 
FACT 
WE WERE 
PROBABLY THE 
TEAM BUT ONCE THINGS 
GOES AGAINST 
US WE DON'T 
HAVE ANY 
ANSWERS 
DIFFICULT FOR DERBY 
WELL DONE PAUL JEWELL TO FACE 
EVERYONE 
I THINK THE INTERVIEW EVERYONE SUGGEST HE IS BECOMING BRITTLE 
BECAUSE HE SUGGEST WE WANT QUALITY 
PLAYERS AND QUALITY PEOPLE L. DO 
NOT CARE HOW MUCH PARACHUTE MONEY 
YOU HAVE GOT TO BRING IN YOU HAVE 
GOT TO GET RESULTS 
A I THINK 
AROUND OUR TABLE WE WERE THINKING 
IT WAS 
DIFFICULT FOR 
FULHAM AND 
BOLTON 
TO GET 
THEMSELVES OUT OF 
TROUBLE A 
GREAT CHANCE NOW 
THEY HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN 
WITH A 
CHANCE FOR SURE 
I AM 
NOT CONVINCED 
THEY 
WILL DO 
IT BUT IT 
TURNS AROUND 
THEY ARE 
GOING TO 
THE NEXT GAME 
WITH 
THAT MUCH 
MORE 
CONFIDENCE AND EVERYTHING DOES DOES MOMENTUM 
PLAY APART 
HERE BECAUSE 
YOU 
CANNOT GET 
A WIN ANYWHERE 
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GET ONE THAT 
WILL BREED RELIEF BECAUSE 
COUPLE OF WINS WOULD SORT IT OUT 
NOW 
CERTAINLY FOR FULHAM THEY ARE NOW WITHIN TOUCHING DISTANCE OF TEAMS 
ABOVE THEM WE TALK ABOUT 
BIRMINGHAM GETTING NERVY READING 
ARE PLAYING SHOCKING AT THE MOMENT 
IS THE TITLE RACE STILL ON 
I AM 
NOT WRITING ARSENAL OFF YET THEY 
ARE CAPABLE OF GOING 
TO OLD 
TRAFFORD AND GETTING A WIN 
I THINK 
UNITED ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE 
DEFENCE BUT THEY WILL HAVE ENOUGH 
TO WIN THE GAME TOMORROW 
HOW DO 
YOU SEE IT AS FAR AS 
THE MANCHESTER 
UNITED ARSENAL AND CHELSEA 
SITUATION WHO KNOWS THERE IS A 
CHANCE FOR CHELSEA AND MANCHESTER 
UNITED FOUR PREMIER LEAGUE AND 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
CHELSEA HAVE GOT 
TO WIN EVERY GAME MANCHESTER 
UNITED I THINK WE'LL DO IT THEY 
HAVE THE GOAL ADVANTAGE AS WELL 
ARSENAL GIVE IT EVERYTHING BUT 
UNITED MENTALITY WILL BE WE WILL 
NOT LOSE THIS GAME AND THEY WILL 
SEE OUT THE SEASON 
I THINK 
THEY 
HAVE THE 
SQUAD TO 
CARRY ON AND 
THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
AS 
ALWAYS YOU 
CAN STUDY 
THE 
UPDATED LEAGUE
