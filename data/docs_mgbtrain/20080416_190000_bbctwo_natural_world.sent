THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND HAVE WITNESSED MANY UPHEAVALS 
BUT THEY'VE SEEN NOTHING 
LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE GLENS NORTH OF INVERNESS 
HERE ONE MAN IS TRYING TO REALISE A BIG IDEA 
PAUL LISTER IS TRYING TO BRING BACK 
WILD ANIMALS THAT WERE ONCE COMMON IN SCOTLAND 
MAMMALS SUCH AS MOOSE WOLVES AND BEARS 
THAT WERE WIPED OUT CENTURIES AGO 
HIS PLANS HAVE PRODUCED HOWLS OF DERISION AS WELL AS ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT 
IS HE A NUTCASE OR WILL HE BE HAILED AS A MODERN DAY MONARCH OF THE GLEN 
THERE ARE HUGE OBSTACLES TO OVERCOME BUT ONE THING IS SURE 
PAUL LISTER IS PREPARED TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO TURN HIS PATCH OF SCOTLAND WILD AGAIN 
THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND LOOK LIKE THE VERY ESSENCE OF WILDNESS 
PRIMEVAL AND UNTOUCHED 
BUT THESE SOLITARY TREES ARE ALL THAT REMAIN OF A VERY DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE 
CENTURIES AGO THESE HILLS WERE CLOAKED 
IN FORESTS OF CALEDONIAN PINE BUT THEY'VE BEEN STRIPPED BARE 
WITH THE TIMBER GONE SHEEP TOOK OVER THE HILLS 
THEY GRAZED OUT MANY OF THE FRAGILE NATIVE PLANTS 
TURNING A ONCE DIVERSE LANDSCAPE INTO A SOGGY DESERT 
EVEN THE HEATHER IS NOTHING BUT A GLORIFIED WEED 
IT'S HARD TO MAKE A LIVING HERE 
CROFTERS HAVE MOSTLY GONE AND THE LAND IS CARVED UP 
BETWEEN A NUMBER OF LARGE ESTATES 
THESE DAYS DEVOTED TO HUNTING SHOOTING AND FISHING 
IT MAY LOOK WILD BUT IN FACT THIS LANDSCAPE IS HEAVILY MANAGED 
FOR THE BENEFIT OF JUST THREE COMMERCIALLY PRIZED ANIMALS 
SALMON GROUSE AND RED DEER 
PEOPLE THINK SCOTLAND OR THE HIGHLANDS IN PARTICULAR ARE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE BEAUTIFUL SCENERY 
AND THEY'RE RIGHT IT DOES LOOK GREAT 
BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE HISTORY 
YOU'LL REALISE JUST HOW MUCH DEVASTATION HAS TAKEN PLACE 
OVER THE CENTURIES 
THERE IS A TANTALISING HINT OF WHAT SCOTLAND LOOKED LIKE THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
IN THE REMAINING FORESTS OF NORTHERN AND EASTERN EUROPE 
HERE IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO GLIMPSE THE ANIMALS THAT ONCE LIVED IN THE HIGHLANDS 
CREATURES WHICH EITHER DIED OUT ONCE THE TREES WERE CUT DOWN OR WERE HUNTED OUT 
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE MOOSE IN A GLEN 
BUT LONG AGO THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN 
AS MUCH A PART OF THE SCOTTISH UPLANDS AS BROWN BEARS 
EACH ANIMAL UP TO THE TOP PREDATOR WOULD HAVE PLAYED A VITAL ROLE 
IN KEEPING THE WOODLAND BALANCED AND HEALTHY 
IT WAS ON A VISIT TO EASTERN EUROPE THAT BUSINESSMAN PAUL LISTER SAW SCOTLAND'S POTENTIAL 
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL TWO THOUSAND THREE THAT HIS FLEDGLING IDEA COULD TAKE OFF 
OVERNIGHT HIS FORTUNES CHANGED 
AS HE CAME INTO CONTROL OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS MADE BY HIS FATHER 
THE FOUNDER OF THE M. F. I. FLAT PACK EMPIRE 
LISTER BOUGHT A TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ACRE ESTATE NORTH OF INVERNESS 
WHERE HE SET ABOUT CHALLENGING THE CENTURIES OLD MONOPOLY OF LAND MANAGEMENT 
HIS BASE IS THE ALLADALE LODGE AT THE EASTERN END OF HIS LAND 
LIKE THE SURROUNDING SPORTING ESTATES 
THERE'S GROUSE THOUSANDS OF RED DEER 
AND THE RIVERS ARE RICH IN SALMON 
BUT ALONG THE TWO GLENS WHICH STRETCH WEST FROM THE LODGE 
THERE IS VERY LITTLE ELSE 
PAUL WANTS TO USE HIS FORTUNE TO CREATE A WILDERNESS RESERVE 
PLANT TREES TO JOIN UP THE FRAGMENTED WOODLAND 
AND POPULATE THE TWO GLENS WITH MOOSE LYNX BEAR AND WOLF 
CREATURES THAT WERE ONCE COMMON HERE 
HE THINKS PEOPLE WOULD PAY TO COME AND SEE THIS RESTORATION PROCESS HAPPEN 
AND WANTS TO PROVE THAT A RICH AND SELF SUSTAINING MIX OF NATIVE WILDLIFE 
CAN MAKE MORE MONEY AND PROVIDE MORE JOBS THAN HUNTING AND FISHING 
THE AREA I'M LOOKING AT HERE IS ONE OF OUR RICHEST PARTS OF THE RESERVE 
AND IT JUST NEEDS TO HAVE BACK 
THE ANIMALS THAT WERE ONCE LIVING HERE HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO 
TO REALLY MAKE THE PLACE COME ALIVE 
TRYING TO BRING BACK SCOTLAND'S LOST RICHES IS NOT A NEW IDEA 
FOR MANY DECADES CONSERVATIONISTS HAVE DISCUSSED 
RE WILDING PARTS OF THE HIGHLANDS AND A RECENT EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 
ENCOURAGES GOVERNMENTS TO DO JUST THIS 
SCOTLAND HAS SUCCESSFULLY REINTRODUCED BIRDS SUCH AS RED KITE AND THE SEA EAGLE 
BUT PLANS TO BRING BACK MAMMALS HAVE FOUNDERED 
EITHER BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH CONTINUOUS FOREST 
TO SUPPORT THESE CREATURES OR BECAUSE LOCAL PEOPLE HAVE OBJECTED 
ALTHOUGH OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 
HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RE INTRODUCED MAMMALS SUCH AS BEAVER SCOTLAND IS LAGGING BEHIND 
RE WILDING HAS PROVED TO BE SO COMPLICATED 
IT'S NOT SURPRISING MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT LISTER'S AMBITIOUS PLANS WITH A MIXTURE OF ADMIRATION AND DISBELIEF 
WELL I STARTED BY THINKING HE WAS A NUTCASE 
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIRE HIM FOR HAVING A GO 
I MEAN THE S. A. S. MOTTO 
HE'S PUT HIS PURSE 
WHERE HIS MOUTH IS AND HE IS TRYING 
AND I ADMIRE THAT IMMENSELY 
PAUL IS A FURNITURE SALESMAN NOT AN ECOLOGIST 
SO HE'S BUYING IN THE BEST ADVICE 
AT ALLADALE THERE IS THE POTENTIAL 
TO DO SOMETHING RADICAL USEFUL IMPORTANT AND WELL FOUNDED 
THE THOUGHT THAT THERE WOULD BE AN OWNER OF A HIGHLAND ESTATE 
WHO IS PREPARED TO MAKE THE TOP PRIORITY OF THAT ESTATE 
THE BIODIVERSITY GAIN AND ALL THAT FLOWS FROM IT THE REVENUE GENERATION AND SO FORTH 
IS QUITE WONDERFUL AND WE SHOULD REJOICE IN THAT 
PAUL'S IMPATIENT TO GET THE PROJECT OFF THE GROUND 
SO AS WELL AS WORLD CLASS EXPERTISE HE'S FOUND WHAT HE BELIEVES IS THE PERFECT BLUEPRINT FOR ALLADALE 
THERE'S NOTHING UNIQUE ABOUT WHAT I'M PROPOSING AT ALLADALE 
THERE'S NOTHING UNIQUE 
IT'S LITERALLY A PLAGIARISATION OF A SUCCESS STORY FROM SOUTH AFRICA 
LIKE THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND SHAMWARI GAME RESERVE WAS ONCE OVERGRAZED AND IMPOVERISHED LAND 
THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND ITS RESTORATION IS BUSINESSMAN ADRIAN GARDINER 
TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHERE WE ARE DRIVING NOW WAS FARMLAND 
THIS WAS ALL RED SOIL ABUSED OVERGRAZED DEGRADED ABSOLUTELY RAVAGED 
OVER THE YEARS SUCCESSFULLY WE'VE CREATED A WHOLE ECOSYSTEM HERE 
FROM A DUNG BEETLE TO THE ELEPHANT 
SO WE'VE PUT BACK THE RIGHTFUL OWNERS TO THIS LAND 
WHAT'S IMPRESSED PAUL IS THAT THE ANIMALS HAVE DONE ALL THE HARD WORK 
TO A LARGE EXTENT WE'VE LET NATURE REPAIR ITSELF 
IF YOU PUT THE RIGHT ANIMALS ON THIS LAND THAT HELPS REPAIR IT THAT'S NATURE 
THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ARE ACTUALLY CLOSER THAN YOU THINK 
THE RIGHT ANIMALS IN THEIR ORIGINAL SETTING 
WILL GO A LONG WAY TO RESTORING THE VEGETATION AT ALLADALE TOO 
BUT AT THE START THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE HEAVILY MANAGED 
PAUL AND HIS RANGERS WILL HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO MONITOR 
DART AND MOVE GRAZERS TO HELP THE RESTORATION PROCESS ALONG 
THIS IS A VERY POPULAR DART GUN SO YOU'LL MOST PROBABLY USE THIS DART SYSTEM AT ALLADALE 
SO THE DART IS IN THERE OH YES QUITE SIMPLE YEAH VERY 
O. K. IF YOU GET A NICE VIEW OF THE RHINO 
THE ONE AT THE BACK NOW BACK LEFT 
TODAY THEY ARE GOING TO DART A YOUNG RHINO SO THEY CAN CLIP AN IDENTIFYING MARK ON HER EAR 
IN A FEW YEARS' TIME PAUL COULD BE DARTING MOOSE OR BEAR AT ALLADALE 
ON THE SHOULDER IF YOU GET 
PERFECT AND IT WENT IN 
VERY SLICK OPERATION 
YEAH THEY'VE GONE INTO THE MIDDLE OF A NICE BIG OPEN AREA 
THEY ONLY HAVE A SHORT TIME BEFORE THE RHINO IS CONSCIOUS AGAIN 
THE VET MAKES A PAINLESS NOTCH IN HER EAR AND THEN INJECTS A STIMULANT TO BRING THE RHINO ROUND 
NO IT'S FINE 
WOW HE WAS UP QUICK 
IN EVERY HEALTHY ECOSYSTEM GRAZERS ARE ONLY PART OF THE STORY 
WITHOUT PREDATORS THE GRAZERS WOULD OVERPOPULATE THE RESERVE AND EAT OUT THE VEGETATION ALL OVER AGAIN 
SHAMWARI NEEDS BIG CATS 
JUST AS ALLADALE NEEDS WOLVES LYNX AND BEAR 
PEOPLE HAVE A LONG HELD MISTRUST OF PREDATORS SO MANY LOCALS 
WERE OUTRAGED WHEN GARDINER WELCOMED LIONS AND HYENAS BACK 
MY NEIGHBOURS HERE WERE ABSOLUTELY UP IN ARMS 
I CAN REMEMBER GOING TO A MEETING WHERE ONE OF THE NEIGHBOURS STOOD UP 
AND HE SAID TO ME MY GRANDFATHER SHOT THE LAST BROWN HYENA HERE 
I SAID WELL I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK 
TO KEEP THE NEIGHBOURS HAPPY AND TO PROTECT HIS PRECIOUS ANIMALS 
GARDINER HAS BUILT A FENCE AROUND HIS SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES 
PAUL WILL DO THE SAME AT ALLADALE BUT EVEN SO 
GARDINER THINKS HE WILL FACE A LOT OF RESISTANCE TO HIS PLANS 
HIS CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO BE MORE THAN OURS WERE 
WE HAD A LOT OF NEIGHBOURS WHO DIDN'T WANT TO ACCEPT WHAT WE WERE GONNA DO AND THERE WERE STRUGGLES 
BUT ALL STRUGGLES ARE WORTH FIGHTING FOR 
I REALLY HOPE THAT I WILL SEE THE BEAR AND THE WOLF BACK 
OH YOU WILL YOU WILL 
FOR SURE 
PAUL IS CONVINCED THE SHAMWARI MODEL WILL WORK IN THE HIGHLANDS 
PEOPLE SAY TO ME WE'RE LIVING IN ANOTHER PART OF THE WORLD 
YES THERE ARE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS 
BUT IT'S THE SAME PRINCIPLE OF TAKING OVER LAND WHICH HAS BEEN RAVAGED BY MAN AND INVESTING IN IT 
AND BRINGING BACK THE SPECIES THAT BELONG THERE 
PAUL IS IMPATIENT TO SEE WOLVES AND BEAR ON HIS RESERVE 
BUT LIKE SHAMWARI HE NEEDS TO START WITH THE BASICS 
HE HAS NATIVE GRAZERS BUT RED DEER ARE THE VERY CORE OF THE PROBLEM 
SCOTLAND HAS WAY TOO MANY OF THEM 
EVEN SCOTTISH NATURAL HERITAGE AGREES THAT NATIVE TREES AND PLANTS 
DON'T STAND A CHANCE WHILE DEER NUMBERS REMAIN SO HIGH 
IN ANY OTHER SETTING THEY'D BE CALLED A PEST 
WITH NO NATIVE PREDATORS TO CONTROL THEM RED DEER NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED STEADILY FOR DECADES 
DESPITE A THREEFOLD INCREASE IN CULLING SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES DEER NUMBERS ARE STILL ON THE RISE 
IN THE INTERESTS OF NATURAL REGENERATION ALLADALE HAS HALVED ITS DEER POPULATION OVER TEN YEARS 
THE PROCESS OF LOWERING NUMBERS GOES ON EVERY YEAR 
THROUGHOUT THE SEASON THEY CULL THE LESSER VALUED HINDS 
THE CHALLENGE IS TO GET CLOSE ENOUGH FOR A SHOT 
I'M NOT SOME BLOODTHIRSTY KILLER LIKE 
IT'S A JOB THAT WE HAVE TO DO AND THAT'S IT YOU KNOW 
JUST GET ON WITH IT 
DEER CULLING IS SOMETHING INNES AND DAVID HAVE ALWAYS HAD TO DO 
BUT NOW THEY FEEL THERE'S A GOAL AT THE END OF IT 
IT'S QUITE A GOOD PLAN YOU KNOW IF WE GET THE ACREAGE 
THIS THING CAN WORK AND CREATE A LOT MORE EMPLOYMENT AND IT WOULD BE QUITE A UNIQUE CONCEPT YOU KNOW 
WE'RE WATCHING THE PROJECT DEVELOP YOU KNOW WE'RE MAKING IT HAPPEN 
SO BRING IT ON 
ONCE THE DEER ARE UNDER CONTROL 
THE EIGHTY THOUSAND SAPLINGS WHICH PAUL HAS PLANTED IN THE VALLEY BOTTOMS WILL HAVE A CHANCE OF REACHING MATURITY 
PAUL ALREADY HAS SOME STANDS OF OLD GROWTH CALEDONIAN PINE ON THE RESERVE 
BUT TO PROVIDE FOOD AND COVER FOR FOREST ANIMALS HE NEEDS MORE 
PINES NEED VERY SPECIFIC GROWING CONDITIONS SO PAUL HAS TURNED TO A VERY SPECIFIC ANIMAL 
THE ARRIVAL OF A GROUP OF BOAR MEANS HIS DREAM OF REGENERATING THIS PATCH OF THE HIGHLANDS HAS ALREADY BEGUN 
BOARS ARE WALKING ROTAVATORS 
AS THEY ROOT AROUND THEY BREAK UP THE BLANKET OF HEATHER AND BRACKEN 
TURN OVER THE SOIL AND CREATE A PERFECT SEEDBED FOR PINE KERNELS 
WHERE'S THE BIG FELLOW HERE HE IS 
FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO BOAR WERE COMMON IN SCOTLAND 
HE IS BIG ISN'T HE 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME ANYONE HAS STUDIED WHAT THEIR RETURN WOULD DO TO THE LANDSCAPE 
PAUL'S ESTATE MANAGER HUGH FULLERTON SMITH IS THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE OPERATION 
WHEN THIS OPPORTUNITY AROSE IT KIND OF REALLY INTRIGUED ME THAT SOMEBODY 
COULD BE TRYING TO SET UP A GENUINE WILDERNESS RESERVE IN THE U. K. 
IT'S QUITE POWERFUL STUFF REALLY THIS WHOLE RE WILDING CONCEPT 
AND I THINK IT'S LONG OVERDUE 
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN IN TWELVE MONTHS IT'S PERFECT 
AND AFTER A WHILE I THINK YOU SUDDENLY REALISE THAT YOU'RE QUITE PRIVILEGED TO BE HERE 
THERE'S PROBABLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS' WORK HERE 
PAUL KNOWS RE WILDING TAKES TIME 
BUT HE'S ALSO A BUSINESSMAN WHO NEEDS RESULTS 
HE WANTS TO FAST FORWARD TO THE NEXT ANIMAL ON HIS WISH LIST 
MOOSE OR EUROPEAN ELK AS THEY ARE OFFICIALLY KNOWN 
UNLIKE RED DEER THESE EIGHT FOOT GIANTS WON'T DECIMATE THE GROUND VEGETATION 
THEY BROWSE ON WILLOWS AND BIRCH 
THEY'VE BEEN ABSENT FROM SCOTLAND FOR OVER TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
BUT PAUL THINKS THAT IF HE HAD SOME AT ALLADALE THEY WOULD START DRAWING THE PUBLIC IN 
BUT SHOPPING FOR THEM IS HARDER THAN HE THOUGHT 
I'VE FOUND MOOSE BUT THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT 
HAVE BANNED THE CAPTURE OF WILD MOOSE SO WE'VE HAD TO GO TO PARKS 
BUT THEY'RE TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE 
I THINK WITH ALL THE VET TESTING 
AND ALL THE CLEARANCES TO IMPORT THEM INTO SCOTLAND 
IT WILL BE ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FOR FOUR ANIMALS 
PAUL DECIDES TO GET ON A PLANE AND LOOK FOR SOME HIMSELF 
HE WANTS YOUNG MOOSE THAT WILL BE ABLE TO GROW UP AS WILD AS POSSIBLE 
AT A MOOSE BREEDER'S HE TRACKS DOWN TWO FEMALES WHO ARE ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH 
HELGA SCOTTISH VISITORS 
ER ENGLISH VISITOR 
ENGLISH OH SORRY 
BRITISH VISITOR 
THEY'RE AMAZING AREN'T THEY I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS CLOSE TO A MOOSE 
HERE COMES THE BOSS SHE IS CALLED LANDA 
THIS ONE HERE 
SHE EVEN BEATS UP THE BULL IF SHE HAS TO 
SHE JUST PRESSES DOWN THE HEAD AND THEN SHE KNEES THEM 
CAN YOU GET IN THERE WITH THEM WE WILL GO IN EVERYONE 
THEY ARE VERY VERY TAME WE'RE GONNA GO IN THERE YES OF COURSE 
THIS IS THE BIGGER BULL THEY MAKE HORSES LOOK SMALL 
LOOK AT THAT THERE YOU GO 
THERE YOU GO YOU LIKE THAT ONE BOY 
I NEED TWO FEMALES AND A MALE YOUNG ONES 
WELL LET'S HAVE A CONTACT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEIR BABIES COME 
PAUL CALLS ALLADALE WITH THE GOOD NEWS 
I THINK I'D BETTER DO A DEAL WITH HIM 
ANYWAY THIS MIGHT JUST BE THE NICHE 
HE'S GOT A HOME FOR TWO OF THE BABIES BUT NOT THE OTHER THREE OR FOUR 
ERM AND I SUSPECT WE JUST NEED THREE AT THE MOST 
MOOSE FROM SWEDEN WOULD BE A CROWD PULLER 
BUT PAUL NEEDS A MIX OF ANIMALS ON THE RESERVE 
EVERY ANIMAL HAS ITS PART TO PLAY AND THE MORE ANIMALS 
WE BRING BACK TO ALLADALE THE LESS WE'LL HAVE TO MANAGE THINGS 
THE LESS WE'LL HAVE TO GO ROUND PLANTING TREES AND SHOOTING DEER 
AND WE CAN LET ANIMALS PLAY THEIR PART 
ENCOURAGING SMALL ANIMALS BACK TO ALLADALE IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE LARGE ONES 
SMALL BIRDS AND MAMMALS HELP TO DISTRIBUTE SEEDS 
AND WOULD PROVIDE FOOD FOR CARNIVORES SUCH AS LYNX AND EAGLES 
BUT THE ANIMAL THAT'S KEY TO RESTORING THE BALANCE OF THE HIGHLANDS IS THE WOLF 
IT'S ALSO THE ANIMAL WITH THE BIGGEST REPUTATION 
EVEN A HUGE NATIONAL PARK LIKE YELLOWSTONE IN THE U. S. 
COURTED CONTROVERSY WHEN THEY BROUGHT THIS PARTICULAR CARNIVORE BACK 
OH IT WAS VERY HEATED I'VE HAD DEATH THREATS AND I THINK PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE DID TOO PROBABLY 
SO IT'S A VERY EMOTIONAL ISSUE VERY POLARISED 
I'VE HAD HUNDREDS OF GUYS COME UP TO ME AT MEETINGS AND TELL ME 
MY DAD MY GRANDAD KILLED THE LAST WOLF IN THIS VALLEY 
THIS RIVER SYSTEM THIS COUNTY THIS STATE THEY'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT 
AND SO IT'S A BIG DEAL OUT WEST WHERE THE LAST WOLVES WERE KILLED ONLY SEVENTY OR EIGHTY YEARS AGO 
FOR MANY PEOPLE THAT'S NOT LONG ENOUGH TO BEGIN TO LOVE AN ANIMAL 
THAT WAS ONCE SO HATED FEAR OF WOLVES RUNS DEEP 
BUT IT'S A FEAR THAT'S UNFOUNDED 
WOLVES HAVE ATTACKED PEOPLE A FEW TIMES IN NORTH AMERICA 
BUT IN THE PAST FOUR HUNDRED YEARS A WILD WOLF HAS NEVER KILLED A PERSON IN NORTH AMERICA 
SOME DAY IT MIGHT HAPPEN BUT OF ALL THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
WOLVES ARE PROBABLY JUST BELOW GROUND SQUIRRELS 
WOLVES ARE NOT A SERIOUS THREAT TO PEOPLE 
WHAT'S MORE WOLVES ARE USEFUL 
THEY'VE DONE A STERLING JOB IN YELLOWSTONE OF KEEPING DESTRUCTIVE GRAZING ANIMALS IN CHECK 
SO MUCH SO THAT TOP BRITISH SCIENTISTS HAVE STUDIED 
WHETHER WOLVES COULD DO THE SAME FOR THE SPIRALLING NUMBER OF HIGHLAND DEER 
WHAT ARE THE LIKELY CONSEQUENCES IF WE TAKE A SPECIES LIKE A WOLF 
AND REINTRODUCE IT INTO PARTS OF SCOTLAND 
OUR PREDICTIONS WERE THAT EVENTUALLY AFTER ABOUT SIXTY YEARS 
DEER NUMBERS WOULD COME DOWN TO PROBABLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A QUARTER OR A THIRD ON WHERE THEY ARE NOW 
AND THE WOLF POPULATION WOULD PLATEAU IN THE HIGHLANDS BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED WOLVES 
EVENTUALLY PREDATOR AND PREY FIND A NATURAL BALANCE AND THAT CAN ONLY BE GOOD FOR THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE 
PAUL'S IDEAS ARE BASED ON SOUND SCIENCE 
BUT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN WOLVES IN BRITAIN SINCE THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTIES 
AND THE MERE MENTION OF THEM CREATES PANIC 
PAUL THINKS THE MEDIA ARE JUST SCAREMONGERING 
I WAS IN SWEDEN THE OTHER WEEK THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED WOLVES 
YOU DON'T READ HORROR STORIES OF PEOPLE BEING EATEN BY WOLVES AND BEARS IN EUROPE 
IT'S JUST NONSENSE AND IT'S ABOUT TIME PEOPLE WOKE UP TO THAT FACT 
IT'S ABOUT TIME STORIES LIKE LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD WERE PUT INTO CONTEXT 
AND PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THAT WOLVES ARE ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED OF MAN 
HILL FARMERS STILL WORRY THAT THEIR LIVESTOCK MIGHT BE AT RISK 
TO ALLAY LOCAL CONCERNS LISTER HAS ALWAYS MADE IT CLEAR 
THAT HE INTENDS TO BUILD A FENCE AROUND HIS ENTIRE PROPERTY 
THE SCARE STORIES ARE A CONSTANT FRUSTRATION 
IT IS A MISREPRESENTATION TO IMAGINE 
THAT CREATING A LARGE FENCED PARK LIKE WILDERNESS AREA 
IS THE SAME THING AS LIBERATING UNFENCED THESE ANIMALS 
INTO THEFREEDOM OF THE COUNTRYSIDE 
I'VE SEEN PRESS COVERAGE WHICH HAS SUGGESTED CONFUSION BETWEEN THE TWO WHICH IS A PRETTY SILLY CONFUSION 
I MEAN MOST PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND FENCE 
THERE'S ALREADY A FIVE HUNDRED ACRE ENCLOSURE FOR THE BOAR 
AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF SAFETY MEASURES TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM WHAT'S INSIDE 
WE'VE GOT A DANGEROUS WILD ANIMAL LICENCE NOW 
SO IT'S OUR JOB TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM THESE ANIMALS 
AND TO PROTECT THE ANIMALS FROM THE PUBLIC AS WELL 
BUT HUGH FINDS HIMSELF IN A LEGAL PARADOX 
THE LAWS PROTECTING THE PUBLIC ARE AT ODDS WITH THE LAWS GUARANTEEING PUBLIC ACCESS IN SCOTLAND 
SOMETHING REALLY STRANGE HAS HAPPENED 
FROM THE SAME OFFICE THAT ISSUED THE DANGEROUS WILD ANIMALS LICENCE 
THE HIGHLAND ACCESS OFFICER NOW INSISTS THAT THE PUBLIC CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THIS ENCLOSURE 
SO WE'VE GOT A PRETTY STRANGE THING GOING ON HERE 
WORRYINGLY THE LEGAL FARCE SURROUNDING THE PIG PEN HAS HUGE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT 
THE FIFTY MILE FENCE WHICH PAUL HAD PLANNED TO BUILD AROUND ALLADALE 
THREE METRES HIGH SPECIALLY DESIGNED AND COSTING TWO MILLION 
WOULD EFFECTIVELY SEAL OFF HIS ESTATE FROM THE REST OF THE HIGHLANDS 
THIS HAS ENRAGED PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT FOR ONE THE VERY FIRST ACTS OF THE NEW SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT 
AN ENFORCEABLE RIGHT TO ROAM 
RAMBLERS AND CLIMBERS AREN'T UP IN ARMS OVER THE WOLVES 
IT'S THE FENCE 
TO KEEP THESE ANIMALS IN PLACE IF YOU LIKE 
HE WANTS TO BUILD A FENCE ELECTRIFIED 
TO CREATE A MASSIVE ENCLOSURE FOR THESE ANIMALS 
NOW THAT'S NOT RE WILDING THAT'S CREATING A ZOO 
PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF AND MANY MANY OTHERS HAVE FOUGHT FOR GENERATIONS 
FOR THIS LAND REFORM ACT THE LEGISLATION THAT WE NOW HAVE IN SCOTLAND 
AND FOR SOMEBODY TO HELICOPTER INTO AN AREA LIKE ALLADALE AND SAY 
I'M GONNA BUILD THIS GREAT BIG FENCE AND TO HELL WITH YOUR LAND REFORM ACT I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR ACCESS 
I WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT THAT ATTITUDE I FIND MORALLY REPUGNANT 
THE FENCE HAS BECOME VERY DIVISIVE 
WHAT PAUL THOUGHT WOULD BE THE SOLUTION 
TO PEOPLE'S FEAR OF WILD ANIMALS IS BECOMING HIS BIGGEST PROBLEM 
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY FENCES 
AND THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT A FENCE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE STOPPED WALKING ON THAT SIDE 
I WORRY THAT BECAUSE OF THE ACCESS LEGISLATION IT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE 
TO DO THIS EXPERIMENT AND I WOULD BE VERY SAD ABOUT THAT 
I THINK THAT WE NEED PLACES FOR NATURE 
I DON'T SEE WHY HUMANS HAVE TO GO EVERYWHERE 
AT ALLADALE THEY STILL HAVE TO GET ON WITH MANAGING THE ANIMALS THAT ARE ALREADY PENNED UP HERE 
AT LEAST HUGH IS MAKING PROGRESS WITH THE BOAR 
YESTERDAY WE PUT RADIO TRACKING COLLARS ON SEVEN OF THE BOAR 
IT'S REALLY GOING ALONG NICELY SO THE PIGS ARE GOING REALLY WELL 
THE RADIO COLLARS WILL HELP CHRIS WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE BOAR RESEARCH TO WORK OUT 
HOW MUCH LAND EACH PIG NEEDS 
THIS BECOMES PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN IN EARLY SUMMER THE ENCLOSURE WELCOMES NEW ARRIVALS 
THESE ARE THE FIRST ANIMALS TO BE BORN AT ALLADALE AND THE FIRST THAT WILL BE BROUGHT UP IN THE WILD 
NOW THAT THE BOAR SEEM WELL ESTABLISHED 
IT'S TIME FOR HUGH TO ORGANISE THE NEXT STAGE OF THE PROJECT 
WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING AHEAD WITH AN IMPORT OF ELK ON SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH 
JUST GOING TO BRING A BULL AND TWO YOUNG FEMALES 
SO THAT'S PRETTY EXCITING 
THE RE WILDING WILL HAPPEN HERE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
IT'S JUST THE TIMING OF US ESTABLISHING THIS BIG RESERVE 
BECAUSE THE COMPLEXITIES OF DOING IT HAVE PROBABLY ESCAPED PAUL A LITTLE 
PAUL HAS OVERLOOKED A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE 
IN THE EYES OF THE LAW A FENCE AROUND HIS RESERVE WOULD CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE ALLADALE PROJECT 
WE IN SCOTTISH NATURAL HERITAGE ARE REMITTED AND INTERESTED IN WILDLIFE WHEN IT'S IN THE WILD 
WHEN YOU PUT A FENCE AROUND AN AREA 
TECHNICALLY AND LEGALLY IT'S NOT THEN IN THE WILD 
I THINK THE DEVELOPMENT AT ALLADALE WOULD NEED THEN TO BE COVERED BY THE ZOO LEGISLATION 
THERE WOULD BE ISSUES ABOUT ANIMAL WELFARE 
THE SURVIVAL AND WELLBEING OF INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS AS PART OF WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE THIS ENCLOSED AREA 
ALLADALE IS HUGE BUT IF IT'S CLASSED AS A ZOO 
IT WOULD THEN BE ILLEGAL TO PUT A PREDATOR AND ITS PREY IN THE SAME ENCLOSED SPACE 
THIS WOULD COMPLETELY UNDERMINE PAUL'S GRAND PLAN 
IF THE HIGHLANDS ARE TO BE PROPERLY RESTORED HE THINKS IT'S VITAL FOR ALL THE ANIMALS TO LIVE TOGETHER 
IT'S THE WOLVES THAT WILL KEEP THE DEER AWAY FROM THE VALLEY BOTTOMS 
WHERE THE RIVERS ARE WHERE WE NEED VEGETATION WE DON'T HAVE THAT ANY MORE UP HERE 
IT'S IMPORTANT SPAWNING GROUNDS FOR THE SALMON 
FOR THE WHOLE CYCLE OF LIFE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE AS MANY OF THE CREATURES BACK THAT WERE ONCE HERE 
ALTHOUGH THIS IS ENCOURAGED BY E. U. LEGISLATION 
NATIONAL LAWS ARE THREATENING TO STOP HIS AMBITIOUS RE WILDING SCHEME IN ITS TRACKS 
THERE'S A CLASH OF LEGISLATION HERE 
ARTICLE TWENTY TWO OF THE E. U. HABITATS DIRECTIVE 
ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH SPECIES AND HABITAT RESTORATION 
THAT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE AN AMBITION TO GET WOLVES AND BEAR AND LYNX BACK INTO SCOTLAND 
THE ZOO ACT BASICALLY PREVENTS THAT HAPPENING 
BY SAYING YOU CANNOT HAVE PREDATOR AND PREY IN THE SAME ENCLOSURE 
WE HAVE MANAGED TO SURROUND OURSELVES IN SO MUCH RED TAPE WITH REGARD TO THINGS THAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO 
WE'RE NOT A ZOO WE'RE NOT A LONGLEAT WE'RE NOT A PRIVATE COLLECTION OF ANIMALS WHAT ARE WE 
WELL WE ARE A WILDERNESS RESERVE 
WE ARE LIKE A NATURE RESERVE WITH A FENCE AROUND IT SO THERE ISN'T A BOX FOR US 
PERHAPS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD IS TO CHALLENGE THE LEGISLATION AND MAKE HIS RESERVE MUCH MUCH LARGER 
NO ONE QUITE KNOWS HOW BIG IT SHOULD BE BUT EVERYONE AGREES THAT ITS CURRENT SIZE IS TOO LIMITING 
IT'S UNDOUBTEDLY TOO SMALL 
THE ORIGINAL THOUGHT WAS IT NEEDED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES 
IF YOU HAD LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES THEN YOU WOULD SAY THAT THE 
DEER ARE TOO MUCH AT A DISADVANTAGE AGAINST FENCE LINES FOR THE WOLVES 
SO YOU CAN'T DO THAT 
IT HAS TO BE BIG 
EVEN THE TRIAL BOAR ENCLOSURE MAY BE TOO SMALL 
THE PIGS ARE DOING A GREAT JOB BREAKING UP THE BRACKEN AND HEATHER 
BUT THE ROOTS OF ONE OF THE OLD GROWTH PINE TREES 
HAVE BEEN DAMAGED IN THE PROCESS 
PROOF THAT THERE'S STILL LOTS TO LEARN ABOUT EVEN THE BASICS OF HIGHLAND RESTORATION 
IN AUGUST THERE'S AN UNEXPECTED SETBACK 
AN OUTBREAK OF FOOT AND MOUTH HAS BEEN CONFIRMED IN ENGLAND 
AND THE GOVERNMENT NERVOUS OF AN EPIDEMIC HAS PUT A BLANKET BAN ON ALL MOVEMENTS OF LIVESTOCK 
I'LL CALL THE SWEDISH TRADES COUNCIL 
HUGH HAS TO CANCEL THE IMPORT OF THE MOOSE 
THEY'RE GOING TO REALLY STICK THIS ONE OUT 
COS THEY GOT SO MUCH EGG ON THEIR FACE LAST TIME LETTING ANY MOVEMENTS TAKE PLACE AT ALL 
GOOD OLD FOOT AND MOUTH HAS ERUPTED AGAIN 
LOOKS LIKE THE SECOND CASE WILL BE CONFIRMED TODAY 
THERE'S NO REAL BAN ON IMPORTING STOCK YOU JUST CAN'T MOVE THEM ONCE THEY GET TO ENGLAND 
SO WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE BAN TO BE LIFTED BEFORE WE CAN BEGIN THE IMPORT 
NOTHING LIKE ALLADALE HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED IN BRITAIN BEFORE 
SO RIGHT FROM THE START PAUL'S HAD TO COME TO TERMS WITH SETBACKS AS WELL AS MISSED OPPORTUNITIES 
AT THE VERY BEGINNING HE HAD A CHANCE TO BUY THE NEXT DOOR ESTATE 
THAT WAS MORE MONEY BUT MY VIEW IS IF YOU'RE VERY WEALTHY AND YOU BUY AN ESTATE YOU'RE NOT LOSING MONEY 
YOU CAN ALWAYS SELL IT AGAIN SOMETIME 
IF THAT OTHER ESTATE HAD BEEN BOUGHT THEN THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT EASIER 
PAUL NOW HAS TO EITHER WAIT FOR ADJOINING LAND TO COME ON THE MARKET 
OR ENCOURAGE HIS NEIGHBOURS WHO ALL RUN SPORTING ESTATES TO COME ON BOARD 
A GROUP OF HIGHLAND ESTATES WITH THE SAME VISION WOULD CREATE ENOUGH SPACE FOR RE WILDING 
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PERSUADING TO DO 
I WOULDN'T WANT THE FENCES 
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE FENCES BUT I WOULDN'T WANT IT HERE 
BUT I ADMIRE HIM FOR HAVING A GO 
MY OWN OPINION IS IT NEEDS NEARER A QUARTER MILLION ACRES THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
AND THEN I THINK HE MIGHT BE GETTING SOMEWHERE 
THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS NOT LEAST WITH THE FENCING 
BOTH IN EXTREMELY BAD WEATHER IN THE WINTER 
AND ALSO ON THE HUMAN SIDE WITH THE ANTIS AND VANDALS CUTTING IN 
AND THEN IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF WOLVES OR BEARS ESCAPE WELL ERM IT WOULD MAKE LIFE INTERESTING 
YOU KNOW BEFORE HE CAME ALONG THERE WAS JUST THE TRADITIONAL SPORTING ESTATE AND THE CROFTERS 
TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THE HIGHLANDS YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP TRYING NEW THINGS 
AS JONNY HAS SAID GOOD ON HIM FOR HAVING A GO IT'S CREATING A LOT OF JOBS AND IT MIGHT WELL BE RIGHT 
LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE A VISION IT'S NEVER SIMPLE IS IT 
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD IDEAS THAT HAVE REALLY REQUIRED A LOT OF ENERGY EFFORT COMMUNICATION AND SUPPORT 
WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO START TO APPRECIATE AND BELIEVE AND TRUST 
IN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE 
BY SEPTEMBER WITH THE MOOSE IMPORTATION STILL ON HOLD PAUL FLIES TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD 
FOR A MUCH NEEDED DOSE OF INSPIRATION AND SUPPORT 
THIS IS PART OF THE BIGGEST RE WILDING PROJECT ON THE PLANET 
ONE HUNDRED TIMES LARGER THAN ALLADALE 
JUST LIKE THE HIGHLANDS THIS PART OF ARGENTINA WAS ONCE IN A MESS 
FORMER CATTLE RANCHES THAT WERE BADLY OVERGRAZED 
PAUL HAS COME TO SEE KRIS AND DOUG TOMPKINS WHO HAVE SUNK THEIR TIME ENERGY AND CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE 
INTO ALLOWING LARGE AREAS WITHIN ARGENTINA AND CHILE TO REGENERATE 
THE FIRST IN A LONG LINE OF NATIVE SPECIES THEY HOPE TO REINTRODUCE IS THE GIANT ANTEATER 
WE HAVE A WHOLE QUARANTINE CENTRE THAT WE'VE BUILT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WETLANDS 
NOW WE HAVE A MALE IN THIS PEN AND A FEMALE IN THE OTHER ONE 
IN THREE WEEKS' TIME WE'RE GONNA LET THEM GO 
OUR GOAL WAS TO RELEASE SEVEN THIS YEAR SO IT'S SLOW GOING YOU KNOW 
YOU'D LOVE TO RELEASE FIFTY BUT THIS IS THE FIRST FORMAL REINTRODUCTION OF A SPECIES IN ARGENTINA 
SO WE WANTED TO ACT AS A MODEL FOR THIS KIND OF WORK FOR THE FUTURE 
LIKE PAUL THE TOMPKINS HAVE HAD TO LEARN BY TRIAL AND ERROR 
THEY'VE HAD SETBACKS BUT THEY'VE SOLDIERED ON FIRM IN THE BELIEF 
THAT TURNING THE LAND WILD IS THE BEST THING TO DO 
LOOK AT THIS SOUTHERN SCREAMER WITH ITS CHICKS 
I THINK PEOPLE TEND TO PROTECT THOSE THINGS THEY LOVE AND THE THINGS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL TO THEM 
AND THAT IN THIS CASE IS WILDNESS FOR US 
DOUG AND KRIS MADE THEIR MONEY FROM THE OUTDOOR CLOTHING COMPANIES ESPRIT PATAGONIA AND NORTH FACE 
IT ALLOWED THEM TO BUY TWENTY TWO MILLION ACRES OF DEGRADED LAND 
BUT ONCE THE RE WILDING IS COMPLETE 
THEY INTEND TO GIFT LARGE AREAS OF LAND BACK TO THE GOVERNMENT SO THAT THEY CAN BE RUN AS NATIONAL PARKS 
IF YOU'RE IN CONSERVATION WORK IT'S AN ENDLESS JOB 
IT'LL NEVER BE FINISHED 
YOU WOULD LIKE TO LIVE FOR EVER AND KEEP DOING IT COS IT'S FASCINATING 
AND VERY SATISFYING 
ESPECIALLY RESTORATION WORK WHICH WE DO A LOT OF 
DAMAGED LANDSCAPES 
I THINK YOU HAVE TO GET POSSESSED 
PAUL MAYBE IS POSSESSED BY THIS TOO THAT WILDNESS IS THE THING TO GO FOR 
IT'S INSPIRATIONAL REALLY FOR ME TO COME DOWN HERE AND MEET THE TOMPKINS 
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS GREAT IT'S PLACES LIKE THIS THAT I GET INSPIRATION FROM 
BUT THE REAL CHALLENGE NOW IS TO GET MORE NEIGHBOURS AND LANDOWNERS 
AND ACQUIRE MORE LAND AND ULTIMATELY GET THE LARGE CARNIVORES BACK 
THAT'S THE REAL CHALLENGE TO GET LAND AND I'M HOPEFUL 
IN THE AUTUMN PAUL HEARS RUMOURS THAT A NEIGHBOURING ESTATE OF THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND ACRES IS UP FOR SALE 
IF HE CAN SECURE A DEAL HE WOULD HAVE ENOUGH LAND TO REALISE HIS DREAMS 
THERE'S MORE GOOD NEWS IN NOVEMBER 
THE TWO YOUNG MOOSE ARE FINALLY ON THEIR WAY FROM SWEDEN 
WE PLANNED TO IMPORT THESE ANIMALS IN SEPTEMBER 
ALONG CAME FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH PUT A SPANNER IN THE WORKS 
FOLLOWED HOT ON THE HEELS BY BLUETONGUE 
THAT MEANT THAT WE COULDN'T COME INTO THE PORT THAT WE CHOSE NEAR GRIMSBY AND SO WE'VE BEEN WAITING 
FOR THEM TO REMOVE THE RESTRICTIONS WHICH THEY HAVEN'T DONE ON THE BLUETONGUE 
SO WE MANAGED TO SOLVE EVERYTHING BY CHARTERING A PLANE IN INVERNESS 
AND WE CAN FLY DIRECT TO UMEA AND STRAIGHT BACK TO INVERNESS WHICH IS JUST GOING TO BE AMAZING 
BEAUTIFUL AREN'T THEY 
MOOSE HAVE BEEN ABSENT FROM THE HIGHLANDS FOR OVER TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
BUT THESE TWO APPEAR TO FIT RIGHT BACK IN 
EVERY ANIMAL PLAYS A PART AND IT'S JUST LIKE A GIANT JIGSAW PUZZLE 
HAVING TWO ELK BACK IT'S JUST ANOTHER PIECE BACK IN THE JIGSAW 
FOR THE TIME BEING THEY'RE IN AN ENCLOSURE BUT EVENTUALLY THEY'LL HAVE THE RUN OF THE RESERVE 
IT'S TAKEN FOUR YEARS AND MILLIONS OF POUNDS JUST TO GET BOAR AND MOOSE BACK ONTO HIS LAND 
MANY HAVE CRITICISED PAUL'S APPROACH BUT HE'S THE ONLY PERSON 
BOLD ENOUGH TO TAKE ON THE PROBLEMS THE DOUBTERS AND THE RED TAPE 
AND DESPITE ALL THE ODDS HE REMAINS DETERMINED TO CREATE THE FIRST WILDERNESS RESERVE IN BRITAIN 
MAYBE IT TAKES A MAVERICK TO MOVE THE BOUNDARIES 
AND WAKE PEOPLE UP TO THE URGENCY AND IMPORTANCE OF RE WILDING 
I BELIEVE WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE LIKES OF PAUL LISTER 
WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO IS AMBITIOUS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WILL SUCCEED 
BUT I THINK IT CONTRIBUTES SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE DEBATE 
SO IF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO RE WILD AREAS WITHIN AN ENCLOSED AREA 
AND WE COLLECT SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE WAY THE ECOSYSTEM CHANGES 
THAT'S A VERY VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THIS DEBATE ABOUT THE USE OF OUR COUNTRYSIDE 
AND ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN HELP CONSERVE SOME OF THESE SPECIES 
HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO STILL THINK PAUL IS MISGUIDED 
PAUL HAS SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENED IN AFRICA 
HE'S THOUGHT THIS COULD HAPPEN IN SCOTLAND I WOULD SAY IT CAN'T 
ALTHOUGH I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE VIEW THAT SAYS THIS SIMPLY CAN'T HAPPEN 
IT'S TOO BIG AN ASK I DON'T BELIEVE IT 
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT GO THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK 
HE'S A CRACKPOT 
BUT AS LONG AS THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE 
THEN IT WILL HAPPEN TOTALLY IT WILL HAPPEN 
NEXT WEEK ON NATURAL WORLD THE MOVING STORY OF A YOUNG HYENA 
STRUGGLING TO MAKE HER WAY IN A HOSTILE WORLD
