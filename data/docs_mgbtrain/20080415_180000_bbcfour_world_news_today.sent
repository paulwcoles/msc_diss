BIOFUELS IN ALL BRITISH PETROL AND 
DIESEL FROM TODAY WILL IT ADD TO 
GLOBAL WARMING AND WORSEN THE FOOD 
CRISIS OR IS IT GOOD FOR THE 
PLANET WE LOOK AT THE ARGUMENTS 
FOR AND AGAINST 
SILVIO BERLUSCONI BACK AS PRIME 
MINISTER FOR THE THIRD TIME BUT HE 
FACES THE DIFFICULT TASK OF 
REJUVENATING THE AILING ECONOMY OF 
EUROPE'S SICK MAN 
GAZA CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE 
WORLD AND YET HAMAS IS GETTING 
STRONGER AND ISRAELIS ARE NO SAFER 
HAS THE POLICY BACKFIRED 
AND A CENTURY OF OH OH SEVEN ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
AFTER THE JAMES BOND AUTHOR IAN 
FLEMING WAS BORN WE HAVE AN 
EXCLUSIVE LOOK INSIDE THE JAMAICAN 
HIDEAWAY WHERE THE SECRET AGENT WAS 
CREATED 
AND THE SOUTH AFRICAN OPERA SINGER 
FROM A BLACK TOWNSHIP WHO TAUGHT 
HIMSELF TO SING BY LISTENING TO 
PAVAROTTI 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ANTI POVERTY 
CAMPAIGNERS ARE FURIOUS ABOUT THE 
BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S INTRODUCTION 
OF BIOFUELS IN ALL PETROL AND 
DIESEL THEY SAY THAT FAR FROM 
HELPING SAVE THE PLANET THE POLICY 
WILL CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL WARMING 
AND EXACERBATE THE GLOBAL FOOD 
CRISIS BY DIVERTING CROPS AWAY FROM 
FOOD PRODUCTION THE GOVERNMENT 
INSISTS THE POLICY IS A CENTRAL 
PLANK TO THEIR MEETING TARGETS ON 
RENEWABLE ENERGY SO FROM TODAY 
ALL FUELS STOLE THAT PETROL 
STATIONS WILL HAVE TO CONTAIN A 
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF BIOFUEL SOLD 
AT AT CARS FUELLED BY CROPS THE OILSEED 
RAPE FROM THIS FIELD IN NORTHERN 
ENGLAND WILL BE USED TO MAKE 
BIODIESEL IN THE FIELD NEXT DOOR 
IS WHEAT TO PRODUCE GASOLENE 
SUBSTITUTE IT IS PART OF THE 
BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S BATTLE AGAINST 
GLOBAL WARMING WHEN THE GOVERNMENT 
SET ITS BIOFUEL TARGET SEVERAL 
YEARS AGO THERE WAS CONSENSUS THERE 
WAS A GOOD AND GREEN SOLUTION NOW 
SOME ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THAT IS 
NOT TRUE 
WHEN YOU FILL UP YOUR CAR 
THERE MIGHT BE PALM OIL GOING INTO 
A PETROL TANK THAT WAS GROWN 
SOMEWHERE IN A TROPICAL RAINFOREST 
THAT WAS A TROPICAL RAINFOREST TWO 
YEARS AGO THERE IS NOTHING THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS DONE TO STOP THAT 
FROM HAPPENING THE BIOFUELS AT THE 
MOMENT ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE IN IN PLACES LIKE BRAZIL THERE ARE 
WORRIES THAT THE BIG DEMAND FOR 
BIOETHANOL FROM SUGAR CANE HAS LED 
TO THE CLEARANCE OF THOUSANDS OF 
HECTARES OF RAINFOREST TO MAKE WAY 
FOR THE CROP MUCH OF BRAZIL'S 
TRANSPORT NOW RUNS ON BIOFUEL BUT 
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT MEANS 
THERE ARE BIG QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT 
SUSTAINABILITY THEY ARE SIMILAR 
FEARS ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF 
NATURAL HABITATS IN OTHER PARTS OF 
THE WORLD THAT THIS PLANT IN 
BRITAIN'S INDUSTRIAL NORTH EAST 
THERE ARE NO SUCH WORRIES HERE 
THEY CONVERT VEGETABLE OIL IN TO 
BUY A DIESEL AND INSIST THAT THEIR 
PRODUCT IS GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE 
ALL OF OUR LOYAL IS CERTIFIED THE 
SMALL PROPORTION THAT DOES COME 
FROM THE TROPICS WE KNOW EXACTLY 
WHICH PLANTATION IT HAS COME FROM 
OIL AND WHETHER THE PLANTATIONS 
HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF 
DEFORESTATION CERTAINLY IN THE 
LAST TEN YEARS 
DESPITE THE GROWING 
CONCERNS OF THE GREEN LOBBY THE 
PUSH FOR BIOFUELS CONTINUES THIS 
WILL BE A HUGE BIOETHANOL PLANT 
WHICH WILL BY NEXT YEAR BE 
PRODUCING A PETROL SUBSTITUTE FROM 
WHEAT WHICH HAS GROWN HERE IN 
BRITAIN BRITAIN THIS IS A LANDMARK DAY FOR THE 
BRITISH BIOFUELS INDUSTRY IN TWO 
YEARS' TIME THERE WILL BE ANOTHER 
SIGNIFICANT STEP WHEN THE MINIMUM 
BIOFUEL CONTENTED BRITISH PETROL 
AND DIESEL WILL DOUBLE TO FIVE PER CENT 
CONTENT IN 
JOINING US NOW AND THE STUDIO IS 
CLARE WENNER HEAD OF TRANSPORT 
BIOFUELS AT THE RIGHT VIEWABLE 
RENEWABLE ENERGY ASSOCIATION 
WE KNOW WE NEED TO REDUCE CARBON 
EMISSIONS THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID 
THAT HAS TO BE DONE IS USING 
BIOFUELS REALLY THE ONLY WAY OF 
DOING THAT 
NO IT IS NOT IT IS A 
START IT IS A WAY OF TRYING TO GET 
CONTROL BACK INTO THE CARBON 
EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORT SECTOR 
WHICH ARE RUNNING AT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT AND 
RISING AT THE MOMENT IN THE U. K. IT 
IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND I THINK WE 
NEED A WHOLE RANGE OF POLICIES OF 
WHICH BIOFUELS IS A PART BUT IT IS 
BY NO MEANS A SILVER BULLET 
DO YOU 
APPROVE OF WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
DONE BY HAVING THIS REQUIRED AMOUNT 
IN PETROL AND DIESEL 
WE DO BUT WE 
APPROVE OF IT BECAUSE IT COMES WITH 
A BIG SUSTAINABILITY LABEL ON IT 
WE HAVE SPENT THE PAST THREE OR 
FOUR YEARS DRAWING UP 
SUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT AND THE GREEN MOVEMENT 
TO ENSURE THAT THE BIOFUELS SOLD IN 
THIS COUNTRY COME FROM SUSTAINABLE 
SOURCES 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT SOURCES WILL NOT ACTUALLY HAVE A PROPER 
SYSTEM IN PLACE TO CHECK WHETHER IT 
COMES FROM SUSTAINABLE SOURCES FOR 
ANOTHER THREE YEARS 
WHAT IS WON'T 
HAVE IS THE ABILITY TO THROW YOU 
INTO JAIL TOMORROW WHAT IT WILL 
HAVE IS A REPORTING SYSTEM THAT 
WILL ALLOW THOSE OF YOUR CHAINS 
WHICH ARE COMPLICATED ACROSS THE 
WORLD TO UNDERSTAND THEM 
WHEN YOU 
LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE IN BRAZIL 
WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN USING IT IN 
THEIR CARS FOR YEARS THERE IS SOME 
KIND OF CONCERN THAT ACTUALLY IT IS 
NOT REALLY REDUCING CARBON 
EMISSIONS THAT MUCH THE EVIDENCE 
IS NOT THERE TO SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE 
SAYING 
I THINK IN BRAZIL AS IN SAYING MANY COUNTRIES THERE ARE GOOD WAYS 
OF PRODUCING THE STOCK FOR BIOFUELS 
AND THERE ARE BAD WAYS WE WANT TO 
CONCENTRATE ON THE GOOD WAYS 
CHOPPING DOWN RAINFORESTS IS AN 
UNDESIRABLE CONSEQUENCE AND WE 
WOULD WANT TO STOP THAT 
WHAT ABOUT 
PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE 
CURRENT FOOD CRISIS THERE IS 
SOMETHING MORALLY REPUGNANT IN 
FEEDING FOOD CROPS TO CARS 
BASICALLY NOT TO HUMANS WHEN THEY 
ARE STARVING 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE 
THE CASE IF THE BIOFUELS INDUSTRY 
WAS DOMINATING THE WORLD BUT 
ACTUALLY ONE PER CENT OF THE WORLD'S 
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AREA IS 
TAKEN UP WITH BIOFUELS 
ONE PER CENT AND 
TO TWO PER CENT BY TWO THOUSAND THIRTY THE GROWING THE EUROPEAN UNION IS SAYING IT WOULD 
LIKE TO DIVERT MUCH MORE THAN THAT 
IN THE FUTURE THE POINT IS THIS 
THE CLIMATE IS NOT RIGHT FOR MAKING 
THAT KIND OF ARGUMENT WHEN YOU HAVE 
GOT PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO 
JUST SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO EAT 
THE REASON THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO 
EAT HIS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PAID 
ENOUGH TO PRODUCE THE FOOD THEY 
HAVE BEEN LIVING ON FOOD AID WHICH 
I AM NOT SURE IS A PARTICULARLY 
GOOD IDEA 
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
FOR INSTANCE TO FILL THE TANK OF A 
SPORTS UTILITY VEHICLE AND THE 
UNITED STATES TOTALLY WITH BIOFUEL 
THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT FOOD CROPS 
TO FEED AN ENTIRE AFRICAN FAMILY 
FOR A YEAR 
IF IT WERE TAKING THE 
FOOD OUT OF THEIR MARTS BUT THERE 
IS FOOD AROUND FOR PEOPLE THE 
REASON WHY PRICES HAVE RISEN IS 
MUCH MORE TO DO WITH POOR HARVESTS 
AND POOR INFRASTRUCTURE 
IT IS NOT 
THE ENTIRE REASON BUT IT 
CONTRIBUTES THAT IS WHY THE 
BRITISH GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WOULD 
LIKE A GLOBAL REVIEW YOU SUPPORT 
THAT 
ABSOLUTELY I THINK WHAT IS THAT GOING ON IN THE UNITED STATES IS 
PROBABLY FAR MORE SERIOUS WHEN IT 
COMES TO WORLD FOOD PRICES THAN 
ANYTHING WE ARE DOING IN EUROPE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE 
DAY'S OTHER NEWS 
AROUND SEVENTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED 
IN THREE SEPARATE BOMB ATTACKS 
ACROSS IRAQ THE MOST DEVASTATING 
ATTACK WAS NEAR RECORD BUILDING IN 
THE CITY OF BAQUBA A CAR EXPLODED 
KILLING FIFTY THREE PEOPLE THREE DIED IN 
CENTRAL BAGHDAD WHEN A CAR BOMB 
TARGETED A POLICE PATROL THREE 
WERE KILLED AT A SUICIDE BOMBING AT 
A RESTAURANT IN RAMADI THE CHAOS 
AT HEATHROW'S NEW TERMINAL FIVE HAS 
CLAIMED ITS FIRST VICTIMS TWO 
SENIOR EXECUTIVES OPERATIONS 
DIRECTOR GARETH KIRKWOOD AND DAVID 
NOYES WOULD BE LEAVING THE COUNTRY 
THEY CONFIRMED THAT THE DEPARTURES 
WERE CONNECTED WITH THE MOVE TO THE 
NEW TERMINAL WHICH HAS COST MORE 
THAN FOUR BILLION THAT IS EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS 
IT OPENED LAST MONTH 
THE LEADER OF ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION 
MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS NOW SAID HE 
WILL TAKE PART IN A RUN OFF VOTE 
WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SO 
LONG AS INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS 
OVERSEE THE POLLS IT COMES AFTER 
THE FIRST REAL SIGN OF CRITICISM 
FROM SOUTH AFRICA THE A. N. C. HAS 
BROKEN RANKS WITH PRESIDENT MBEKI 
AND CRITICISED THE DELAY IN THE 
RESULTS RESULTS DOZENS OF PEOPLE ARE FEARED DEAD 
AFTER AN AEROPLANE CARRYING EIGHTY FIVE 
PEOPLE CRASHED IN THE DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF CONGO CONGO IT HAD 
TAKEN OFF FROM THE CITY OF GOMA 
WHEN IT CAME DOWN REPORTEDLY IN A 
HEAVILY POPULATED AREA 
SILVIO BERLUSCONI IS BACK FOR THE 
THIRD TIME AS PRIME MINISTER OF 
ITALY AFTER A RESOUNDING VICTORY 
FOR HIS CENTRE RIGHT ALLIANCE LAST 
NIGHT TODAY HE WAS SOUNDING MORE 
SOMBRE THAN HIS USUAL JOCULAR SELF 
WARNING OF THE DIFFICULT MONTHS 
AHEAD NO SURPRISE THERE ITALY IS 
IN THE ECONOMIC DOLDRUMS MOUNTAINS 
OF UNCOLLECTED RUBBISH ARE PILING 
UP IN NAPLES AND THE NATIONAL 
AIRLINE ALITALIA IS USING WHAT 
LOSING ONE MILLION EUROS EVERY DAY 
THAT'S GOOD TO CHRISTIAN FRASER IN 
ROME THE CHALLENGERS FACING HIM 
ARE SO GREAT BUT DOES HE HAVE THE 
MANDATE TO TRY AND TACKLE THIS BY BY ANY MEASURE THIS IS A RESOUNDING 
VICTORY AN EXTRAORDINARY COMEBACK 
AS WELL IT WAS ONLY TWO YEARS AGO 
AGED SIXTY NINE THAT HE WAS DEFEATED BY A 
ROMANO PRODI THERE WERE MANY 
COUNTING HIM AS FINISHED AND 
READING HIS POLITICAL OBITUARY WE 
ARE TALKING ABOUT SILVIO BERLUSCONI 
A MAN WITH A LOT OF AMBITION HE 
HAS BEEN TALKING IN A PRESS 
CONFERENCE IN THE LAST HOUR AND HE 
IS CONFIDENT HE IS THE MAN FOR THE 
JOB 
WE KNOW WHAT IT JOB MEANS TO GOVERN WE WILL PUT THIS 
EXPERIENCE TO GOOD USE WE WILL 
CHOOSE BETWEEN USEFUL AND LESS 
USEFUL THINGS WE WILL IMMEDIATELY 
BE ABLE TO PUT OUR HANDS INTO THE 
MACHINE OF STATE IN ORDER TO REALLY 
OPERATE IMMEDIATELY 
WELL LET'S 
GET A FLAVOUR OF WHAT THE ITALIANS 
ARE SAYING ABOUT THIS I HAVE A 
POPULAR COMEDIAN SABINA GUZZANTI 
WITH ME YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING 
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE DO YOU THINK 
SILVIO BERLUSCONI IS STILL THE MAN 
FOR THE JOB 
I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT 
IT I THINK IT IS THE WORST 
NIGHTMARE 
THE WORST NIGHTMARE WHY NIGHTMARE IS THAT 
THERE ARE LOTS OF PROBLEMS 
WITH JUSTICE THEY DID NOT RESPECT 
DEMOCRACY INSTITUTIONS AND IT IS 
BASICALLY BEING FRIENDS WITH ALL OF 
THE WORST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD FROM 
VLADIMIR PUTIN TO THE ITALIAN 
FASCISTS AND THE NEW RACIST 
MOVEMENTS 
WE WILL COME BACK TO THE MOVEMENTS FASCISTS BUT IT MUST BE A GOOD 
THING THAT WE HAVE A MORE 
SIMPLIFIED POLITICAL PROCESS THE 
MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING ABOUT THIS 
ELECTION IS THAT OF TWENTY SIX PARTIES 
THAT WERE PART OF THE PARLIAMENT 
LAST TIME TWENTY OF THEM HAVE BEEN 
SWEPT AWAY WE HAVE JUST SIX 
PARTIES AND HERE IS SILVIO 
BERLUSCONI AT THE HEAD OF A VERY 
TIGHT UNITED ALLIANCE 
I KNOW FOR 
YOU ANGLO SAXONS THIS IS A GOOD 
POINT WE DON'T CARE AT ALL ABOUT A 
LOT OF PARTY TO PARTIES WE CARE 
ABOUT OTHER THINGS THE SYSTEM IS 
QUITE CORRUPTED AND PEOPLE DO NOT 
CARE ABOUT POLITICS THEY JUST CARE 
ABOUT GETTING SOME SEATS THEY KEEP 
SHARING THEMSELVES IN MANY PARTS 
SILVIO BERLUSCONI IS NOT A 
DEMONSTRATION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
THE FEW PARTIES THE PROBLEM IS 
THAT HE CAN PAY PEOPLE WORKING FOR 
HIM THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WHY HE 
CAN COLLECT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BOAT AND THE WAY 
THAT IT IS BROKEN DOWN THERE IS A 
DECISIVE STEP TO THE RIGHT VOTE 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL 
ALLIANCE WE ALSO HAVE THE NORTHERN 
LEAGUE THE XENOPHOBIC NOR THE LEAD 
A SEPARATIST MOVEMENT WHO ARE ANTI 
IMMIGRATION 
IT IS SCARY IMMIGRATION NORTHERN LEAGUE WHAT DOES IT SAY 
ABOUT THE WAY ITALIANS ARE 
THINKING 
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT EXIST THINKING WE HAVE HORRIBLE TELEVISION 
HORRIBLE SCHOOL SYSTEM THERE IS NO 
WAY TO HAVE SOME INSPIRATION ABOUT 
THINKING SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE VERY 
IGNORANT JUST THINKING ABOUT NOT 
PAYING TAXES IT IS VERY SIMPLE IT 
IS NOT SO COMPLICATED IT IS VERY 
CORRUPT AND SAD THIS COUNTRY IS 
GOING TO BE DESTROYED THE COLISEUM 
IS GOING TO BE SOLD PROBABLY THEY 
WERE JUST GOING TO SELL ALL OF THE 
MOST IMPORTANT ART LAST TIME ALL 
OF THE ITALIAN STUFF TO FOREIGNERS 
IT IS A VERY DEPRESSING PICTURE 
CAN WE TAKE ANY HARM AT ALL FROM 
THIS 
WHY WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE THIS HAPPY THERE IS NO POINT A SAD 
MOMENT IN LIFE THIS IS ONE NINETY NINETY VERY MUCH INDEED SILVIO BERLUSCONI 
IS BACK IN PARLIAMENT WITH A 
THUMPING MAJORITY IN BOTH HOUSES 
HE HAS A LOT TO DO BUT THEN HE 
DOES HAVE A PLATFORM TO PUSH 
THROUGH REFORMS 
NOW ISRAEL'S POLICY OF ISOLATING 
HAMAS AND SQUEEZING GAZA'S PEOPLE 
TO UNDERCUT IT SUPPORT HAS 
BACKFIRED THAT IS ACCORDING TO 
SOME OBSERVERS OF THE CONFLICT 
THEY CLAIM IT HAS SIMPLY MADE HAMAS 
STRONGER ALL THE WHILE 
PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS ARE SUFFERING 
AND ISRAELIS ARE LEFT NO SAFER OUR 
MIDDLE EAST EDITOR JEREMY BOWEN HAS 
TRAVELLED TO THE GAZA STRIP ISRAEL 
AND HAS BEEN TO VISIT THEIR HAMAS 
LEADER KHALED MESHAAL TO SEE IF 
THERE IS A CHANCE OF A CEASEFIRE 
GAZA IS BEING CUT OFF FROM THE 
MODERN WORLD THERE'S VERY LITTLE 
FOOD ONLY THE BAREST ESSENTIAL HAS 
BEEN ALLOWED FROM ISRAEL SINCE 
HAMAS TOOK POWER FROM FATAH LAST 
YEAR THE ECONOMY HAS COLLAPSED 
EIGHTY SEVEN PER CENT OF PRIVATE BUSINESSES HAVE GONE 
BUST BUT HAMAS THE TARGET OF THE 
SANCTIONS IS IF ANYTHING STRONGER 
THE POLICY IS FAILING BECAUSE IT'S 
CREATING CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND 
WHICH ARE NOT CONDUCIVE TO A PEACE 
PROCESS THE MIND SET OF THE PEOPLE 
HERE IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE 
FRUSTRATED MORE AND MORE DESPERATE 
AND RADICAL AND IT'S ALL SO 
PREDICTABLE THAT'S THE TRAGEDY 
SECURITY IS STILL NECESSARY FOR THE 
UN HERE IN AREAS WHERE THERE'S A 
KIDNAP RISK THE B. B. C. REQUESTS IT 
FROM HAMAS FOR PALESTINIANS HAMAS 
GUNS IMPOSE LAW AND ORDER ACCEPT 
DURING ISRAELI RAIDS HERE THEY 
WERE MOURNING ELEVEN YEAR OLD BOY 
KILLED BY SOLDIERS THIS WEEK 
HIS FATHER A FATAH POLICEMAN WAS 
WARY OF A HAMAS BODYGUARDS BUT HIS 
FAMILY BLAME GAZA'S MISERY ON OLD 
ENEMIES NOT HAMAS 
WHERE IS THE 
WORLD NOBODY IS WITH US WE ARE 
ONLY IN THIS LIFE 
THERE COULD BE 
AN ALL TERPIVE TO ALL OF THIS 
A DIFFERENT KIND OF POLICY THAT 
SEEKS TO CREATE A CEASEFIRE AND TO 
OPEN UP THE BORDERS OF GAZA 
THE THING ABOUT THAT IS IT WOULD 
MEAN DOING BUSINESS WITH HAMAS AND 
RECOGNISING THAT ITS CONTROL OF 
GAZA HAS BECOME A FACT OF LIFE 
WITH ROCKET ATTACKS OUT OF GAZA 
CONTINUING SOME LEADING ISRAELIS 
BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR A PROPER 
DIALOGUE 
I THINK BOTH SIDES ARE DIALOGUE NOT ISSUING THE GOAL HAMAS IS NOT 
GOING TO SURRENDER BECAUSE OF THE 
HAMAS THERE ARE PEOPLE SUFFERING 
WE SAW THE HAMAS POLITICAL CHIEF 
KHALED MESHAAL HE SAYS THERE ARE 
POLITICAL CUTBACKS 
THERE'S NO AGREEMENT THAT IT WILL 
WORK 
WE SAID IF ISRAEL COMMITS WORK ITSELF TO A COMPREHENSIVE CALM WE 
ARE READY TO CO OPERATE BUT ISRAEL 
SAYS NO ISRAEL REJECTS ALL 
PROPOSALS PROPOSALS NEITHER SIDE TRUSTS ITS ENEMY 
NOBODY IS SUGGESTING THEY WILL TALK 
PEACE BUT BOTH WANT TO TAKE THE 
PRESSURE OFF THEIR CIVILIANS AND 
CEASEFIRE WOULD BE A START NOW 
JAMES BOND THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS 
SECRET AGENT WASN'T CONCEIVED IN 
BRITAIN BUT WAS DREAMT UP ON AN 
IDYLLIC ESTATE IN JAMAICA THE 
AUTHOR IAN FLEMING USED THE HOME 
AS AN INSPIRATION FOR MANY OF THE 
SUCCESSFUL OH OH OH SEVEN NOVELS AND TODAY 
FANS HAVE BEEN PAYING TRIBUTE TO 
HIS BOOKS ON THE BIRTHDAY OF HIS 
BIRTH THE SCENT AND SMOKE AND 
SWEAT OF A CASINO ARE NAUSEATING 
AT THREE IN THE MORNING WITH THOSE 
WORDS BRITAIN'S MOST FAMOUS SECRET 
AGENT WAS CREATED IAN FLEMING WENT 
ON TO WRITE EVERY ONE OF THE JAMES 
BOND NOVELS HERE AT HIS HOME IN 
JAMAICA GOLDENEYE WE WERE SHOWN 
AROUND BY THE QUEUE RATETOR OF A 
NEW EXHIBITION AT THE IMPERIAL WAR 
MUSEUM 
NOW WE'RE COMING INTO THE MUSEUM VERY ROOM WHERE JAMES BOND WAS BORN 
ON SEVENTEENTH OF FEBRUARY NINETEEN FIFTY TWO AND 
FLEMING HAD BEEN FOR HIS CUSTOMARY 
SWIM IN THE MORNING HE HAD 
BREAKFAST AND DECIDED HE WAS GOING 
TO GET DOWN TO WRITING THE SPY 
STORY TO END ALL SPY STORIES 
DURING WORLD WAR TWO FLEMING SERVED 
AS A COMMANDER IN NAVAL 
INTELLIGENCE ONE OF THE 
INSPIRATIONS FOR BOND HE FELL IN 
LOVE WITH JAY MA KA AFTER 
ATTENDING A SUBMARINE WARFARE 
CONFERENCE ON THE ISLAND THE 
CARIBBEAN PROVIDED HIM WITH A NAME 
FOR HIS HERO 
I WANTED A FLAT 
QUIET NAME AND ONE OF MY BIBLES 
OUT HERE IS JAMES BOND ACE BIRDS OF 
THE WEST INDIES AND I THOUGHT 
JAMES BOND NOW THAT'S A FITTING 
QUIET NAME SO I SIMPLY STOLE IT 
AND USED IT 
COMING HERE ALLOWED 
FLEMING TO ESCAPE A BRITAIN IN 
POST IMPERIAL DECLINE ESCAPEISM 
ESSENTIAL TO THE APPEAL OF HIS 
BOOKS JAMAICA GAVE A SENSE OF 
BRITAIN STILL BEING ON TOP WE WE CALLED HIM COMMANDER HE LIKED WHEN 
WE CALLED HIM COMMANDER GOLDENEYE GOLDENEYE HAS BECOME A LUXURY HOTEL BUT 
RAMSAY ONE OF THE FORMER GARDENERS 
STILL WORKS THERE DID YOU REALISE 
THAT COMMANDER FLEMING WAS WRITING 
THE BOOKS 
NONE OF US KNEW WHAT HE 
WAS WRITING BECAUSE WE NEVER SEEN 
A MOVIE THAT'S NUMBER ONE AND 
WHEN HE USED TO WRITE DURING THE 
DAY TIME WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE 
WAS DOING 
JAMAICA WAS NOT ONLY A 
PLACE WHERE POLICEMEN POLICEMEN 
COULD ESCAPE AND WRITE IT PROVIDED 
HIM WITH THE EXOTIC LOCATIONS THAT 
POPULATED THE BOND BOOKS AND FILMS 
MY NAME IS BOND JAMES BOND 
IN HIS FINAL YEARS FLEMING'S 
CREATION WOULD TAKE ON A NEW LIFE 
AS BOND MOVED FROM THE BOOKS TO THE 
SCREEN TAKING WITH HIM THE GLAMOUR 
AND EXCITEMENT THAT JAMAICA HAD 
PROVIDED OVER MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS 
JAMES BOND HAS MOVED THROUGH MANY 
INCARNATIONS A SIGN OF THE 
INDURING APPEAL OF IAN FLEMING'S 
WORK NOW SOUTH AFRICA HAS GIVEN 
THE WORLD GREAT SINGERS LIKE MIRIAM 
MAKEBA AND HUGH MASEKELA GREAT OP 
RATTIC PERFORMERS YOU DON'T EXPECT 
FROM THE BLACK COMMUNITY BUT ONE 
SIPHIWO NTSHEBE HAS BEEN COMPARED 
TO LUCIANO PAVAROTTI HE GREW UP A 
POOR TOWNSHIP IN THE EASTERN CAPE 
AND TAUGHT HIMSELF HOW TO SING 
OPERA BY LISTENING TO THE GREAT 
MASTERS HE SANG IN HIS LOCAL 
CHURCH AND AT SIXTEEN WAS SPOTTED AND 
OFFERED A SCHOLARSHIP FROM THE 
UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN HERE'S A 
TASTE OF HIM PERFORMING PUCCINI 
SO SIPHIWO NTSHEBE LISTENING TO 
YOU SINGING THERE AMAZING YOU GOT 
A VERY POWERFUL VOICE DO YOU STYLE 
YOURSELF ON THE LATE GREAT 
LUCIANO PAVAROTTI 
PAVAROTTI IS ONE 
OF THE PEOPLE THAT I GREW UP 
LISTENING TO IN A WAY I WOULD SAY 
YES AND GO BACK IN THE TIME OF 
GELI AND FOR ME I BELIEVE IN THE 
OLD SCHOOL OF SINGING 
HOW DID YOU GET INTO OPERA DID YOU 
JUST SIMPLY AS A SMALL CHILD START 
LISTENING TO IT AND THOUGHT I LOVE 
IT 
I THINK FOR ME IT ONLY IT HAPPENED I CAN ONLY SAY THROUGH MY 
MOTHER MOTHER BECAUSE IT WAS MY MOTHER WHO 
CARRIED ME THE WHOLE SEVEN MONTHS 
WHEN SHE WAS GOING TO WORK AND THE 
MUSIC THAT WAS PLAYED THERE WAS 
CLASSICAL MUSIC SO WHEN I CAME 
BACK FOR THAT I COULDN'T WAIT TO 
COME OUT BECAUSE I CAME OUT SEVEN 
MONTHS MONTHS SO WHEN AND THEN I GREW UP AS A 
KID I PLAYED WITH THE RADIO 
STATION AND WHEN I HEAR THIS 
CLASSICAL MUSIC I GET SO DRAWN TO 
IT AND SO SOMEHOW IT WAS LIKE A 
DEJA VU 
YOUR MOTHER WAS LISTENING 
CLASSICAL MUSIC BECAUSE IT WAS AT 
HER PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT YES YES WHERE WAS SHE WORKING 
AS A 
DOMESTIC WORKER 
IN A WHITE HOUSE 
IN SOUTH AFRICA YES 
YOU GREW UP YES IN A TOWNSHIP IN PORT ELIZABETH ON 
THE EASTERN CAPE IT IS NOT THE 
KIND OF MUSIC YOU'D NORMALLY FIND 
PEOPLE LISTENING TO IN A TOWNSHIP 
IN SOUTH AFRICA WERE YOUR FRIENDS 
AND FAMILY SUPPORTIVE 
YES IN FACT 
MY FATHER HE SAID TO ME IF THIS 
IS WHAT YOU WANT BECAUSE AT THE 
BEGINNING I WAS ENROLLED FOR DOING 
ENGINEERING AND THEN HE SAID IF 
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IF YOU 
ARE HAPPY WE AS A FAMILY WILL BE 
HAPPY WE ARE WITH YOU WHATEVER YOU 
DO THEN WHAT I DID IN ONE OF THE 
CHOIRS THAT I HELPED THE CHILDREN'S 
CHOIR WHICH WAS MAINLY WHITE KIDS 
TRYING TO SING AFRICAN MUSIC AS 
WELL AS WELL AS THE CLASSICAL 
MUSIC SO I WENT THERE AND ONE OF 
MY TEACHERS SAID THIS IS HAPPENING 
AND THERE'S A BIG SHOW COMING UP 
IF YOU CAN BRING YOUR FOLKS TO COME 
AND WATCH YOU PERFORMING WITH US 
THAT WOULD BE GREAT 
THEY DID AND 
EVERYONE SAID WHY ARE YOU LISTENING 
TO THIS 
MY FAITH CHER AND MOTHER 
AND FAMILY WERE CRYING WITH JOY TO 
SEE ME PERFORMING 
YOU'RE TOTALLY 
SELF TAUGHT OR HAVE YOU SINCE HAD 
LESSONS AND YOU OBVIOUSLY SPEAK 
ITALIAN 
I HAD TEACHERS AS I WENT ITALIAN ALONG BECAUSE OF COURSE TEACHERS 
THEY ONLY HEAR A VOICE AND THINK 
THERE'S POTENTIAL AND GRAB YOU 
BUT IF THEY SAY THERE'S NOTHING 
THERE THEY DON'T BE BOTHERED SO 
SOMETIMES THE BETTER YOU ARE IN 
TERMS OF WHAT YOU'VE GIVEN THEN 
THE MORE CHANCES THAT YOU WILL GET 
ALL SORTS OF TEACHERS 
BUT YOU WERE 
SELF TAUGHT UP TO A CERTAIN AGE 
YES I WAS FORTUNATELY MY GNAT 
THEY ARE WAS WRITING FOR CHURCH WE 
WOULD DANCE AND SING IN CHURCH SO 
I STARTED TO SING FROM THAT EARLY 
YOUNG AGE BUT NOT OPERA AT THE 
TIME 
GO ON SING SOMETHING FOR US TIME WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SING THIS TIME 
AN EXTRACT FROM LA BOHEME WHICH 
FINISHES A LARA 
THAT WAS A SOUTH AFRICA OPERA 
SINGER WITH HIS RENDITION FROM LA 
BOHEME WE WERE LISTENING TO 
EXCITEDLY WHEN HE CAME EARLIER 
LET'S REMIND YOU OF OUR TOP STORE 
YIFPLT FROM TODAY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF ALL 
PETROL AND DIESEL MUST BE MADE OF 
BIOFUEL AS PART OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE 
CARBON EMISSIONS BUT OTHERS 
QUESTION WHETHER IT IS GOOD FOR THE 
ENVIRONMENT OR WORSE THIS IS WORLD 
NEWS TODAY THAT IS ALL FROM THE 
PROGRAMME NEXT ON B. B. C. FOUR IT IS 
THE WEATHER 
MAYBE THUNDER AND ACROSS PARTS OF 
EAST ANGLIA SO THE SOUTH EAST TWELVE 
FOR LONDON AND PATCHY CLOUD 
COME 
TO THE WEST DRIER WEATHER AWAY 
FROM THE WEATHER SYSTEM AND MANAGE 
AGO FINE AFTERNOON FROM PLYMOUTH 
SIMILAR TO CARDIFF BRIGHT SKIES 
FOR A GOOD PART OF WALES AND BACK 
ACROSS PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
NOT LOOKING TOO BAD SO DRIER AIR 
AND FINE WITH THE SUNNY SPELLS 
NOTICE THIS WEATHER SYSTEM HERE 
TRIES TO BEND IN AND AS IT 
SQUEEZES THE ISOBARS THIS FIRST 
FLOW FIZZLES APART WHAT IT DOES DO 
IS GIVES US A KEEN EASTERLY FLOW 
COOLER FEEL TO THE DAY ONE OR TWO 
SHOWERS THIS WET WEATHER COMING IN 
BUT CERTAINLY FEELING
