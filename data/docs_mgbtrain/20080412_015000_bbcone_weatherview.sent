JOIN US AND SEE IF THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT 
THE WEEK ENDED ON A SHOWERY NOTE AND I SUSPECT THAT THEME WILL CONTINUE 
RIGHT INTO THE BODY OF THE WEEKEND 
TODAY IT WILL BE A MIXTURE OF SUNSHINE AND PRETTY HEFTY SHOWERS 
FOR MANY PARTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
FRIDAY WAS MARKED BY THE TRANSITION OF ONE ORGANISED BAND OF WEATHER 
FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS ALL PARTS 
OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS ANOTHER HAS FOLLOWED IN ITS TRACKS 
IT'S AFFECTING THE SOUTH WESTERN QUARTER OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
AT THE TAIL END OF FRIDAY 
AND DRIVING ITS WAY FURTHER TOWARDS THE NORTH AND EAST 
FURTHER NORTH IS ANOTHER FEATURE ACROSS THE HEART OF SCOTLAND 
PRODUCING SOME SNOWFALL INTO THE GRAMPIANS IT'LL BE A CHILLY NIGHT 
ACROSS MANY NORTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS 
CLEAR SKIES FOR THE MOST PART 
TO START OFF THE DAY IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN WALES 
ONE OR TWO SHOWERS ACROSS THE NORTH AND WEST 
SIMILAR IN NORTHERN IRELAND SHOWERS IN THE NORTH ELSEWHERE FINE AND DRY 
NOT OVERLY WARM AT ONLY TWO DEGREES 
FRIDAY'S FEATURE STILL LURKING WITH INTENT ACROSS THE HEART OF SCOTLAND 
A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE AWAY TOWARDS THE FAR NORTH WEST 
AND AS WE COME ACROSS THE BORDER 
SUNSHINE IN PARTS OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND BUT GENERALLY CLOUDY 
AS WE COME FURTHER SOUTH A MUCH DRIER AND BRIGHTER START FOR MUCH 
OF THE MIDLANDS EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTHERN COASTAL FRINGES OF ENGLAND 
FROM THE WORD GO THERE'LL BE ENOUGH CLOUD ACROSS CORNWALL AND WEST DEVON 
TO START PRODUCING ONE OR TWO SHOWERS THERE 
AS WE GO THROUGH THE MORNING PUSHING ON IN TO THE AFTERNOON 
YOU'LL FIND THAT THESE SHOWERS FORM QUITE A DISCRETE BAND OF WEATHER 
LURKING THEIR WAY EVER FURTHER TOWARDS THE EAST 
UP TOWARDS THE HOME COUNTIES AND AT THE SAME TIME 
PRODUCING CLOUD ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTH 
COME THE AFTERNOON MAINLY A MIXTURE OF SUNNY SPELLS AND SHOWERS 
ACROSS THE MIDLANDS ACROSS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND TOO 
HERE AGAIN ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF SCOTLAND 
QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD WITH THE ODD PIECE OF RAIN ABOUT IT 
LOOKING FURTHER NORTH SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS 
SO TOO FOR NORTHERN IRELAND HAVING HAD A BRIEF FLIRTATION 
WITH PERSISTENT RAIN IN THE FAR SOUTH IN THE LATTER PART OF THE MORNING 
THAT WILL MOVE IN TO THE NORTH OF WALES 
SO MAKE THE MOST OF ANY SUNSHINE IT'S SURE NOT TO LAST 
AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER ON WE HAD A BRIGHT START IN THE SOUTH WEST 
BUT THOSE SHOWERS WILL PROPAGATE THEIR WAY FROM THE SOUTH WEST 
THROUGH CENTRAL SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND IN TO LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST 
IT WON'T STOP THE TEMPERATURES PUSHING TO AROUND FOURTEEN AS A TOPS 
AS WE GET ON FROM SATURDAY IN TO SUNDAY 
MANY SHOWERS WILL DIE AWAY FROM THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN AREAS 
AND WITH SKIES CLEARING IT WILL BE A CHILLY NIGHT 
WITH A BIT OF MIST AND FOG AND A LITTLE BIT OF FROST 
A CHILLY START FOR THE LONDON MARATHON 
AS THE DAY GOES ON AND SO WILL YOUR RUN PERHAPS 
THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF SHOWERS AROUND 
FOR THE LATE ARRIVALS AT THE FINISH 
WE KEEP THAT SHOWERY THEME GOING 
AS WE MOVE IN TO NEXT WEEK 
THERE COULD BE AN ORGANISED FEATURE 
COMING THROUGH LATE ON MONDAY 
INTO THE FIRST PART OF TUESDAY 
PROLONGING THE SHOWERS 
AND INTENSIFYING THEM THAT FEATURE 
MAY BE WORKING ITS WAY TOWARDS 
THE SOUTHERN HALF OF BRITAIN 
TOWARDS THE LATTER PART OF TUESDAY 
QUITE A BIT GOING ON 
IF YOU WANT MORE DETAILS THEY'RE ON THE WEBSITE BUT FOR ME GOOD NIGHT 
IS EVERYTHING O. K. EVERYTHING'S FINE 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BOY HE MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR 
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
HE'S FEEDING OFF HIS ANGER AND HIS GRIEF YOU CAN'T DO THIS 
FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE KEEPING HIM 
DAD DAD 
WAKING THE DEAD RETURNS NO
