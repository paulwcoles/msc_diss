HELLO SUNDAY QUITE A STORMY DAY ACROSS SOME OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
THE REST OF THE BANK HOLIDAY IS GOING TO BE MORE WARM AND BRIGHT 
THAN IT WILL BE ABOUT THUNDER STORMS AND SHOWERS 
THERE WILL BE SOME AROUND WE STILL HAVE THE WEATHER FRONT 
THAT HAS BEEN ACROSS THE BRITISH ISLES FOR A FEW DAYS 
IT'S NOW TAKING A TURN TOWARDS THE EAST SHOWERS TO THAT SIDE 
FURTHER WEST SOMEWHAT CLEARER SKIES TEMPERATURE FALLS OVERNIGHT 
THROUGH NORTHERN IRELAND WEST OFWALES AND DOWN INTO THE SOUTH 
WHERE THERE COULD BE MIST ON THE COAST 
INLAND IN WALES DRY AND FINE WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE 
OUT WEST LOW CLOUD OR SOME FOG 
NOT VERY FAR FROM THE ISLE OF MAN SO MAKE THE MOST OF ANY SUNSHINE 
NORTHERN IRELAND A GLORIOUS START 
PRETTY DECENT FOR MUCH OF SCOTLAND BUT MURK IN THE NORTH EAST 
AND THAT WEATHER FRONT NOT VERY FAR AWAY FROM THE NORTHERN ISLES 
COME A LITTLE BIT FURTHER SOUTH UNDER THE BODY OF THE FRONT 
AND IT NEVER REALLY HAS AN EFFECT IN EAST ANGLIA OR KENT 
BRIGHTER SKIES THERE AND A MILD START TO THE DAY 
OUT IN THE SOUTH WEST STAY AWAY FROM THE COASTAL FRINGES 
AND YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO GET A DRY FINE START WITH SOME SUNSHINE 
IN THE REST OF THE MORNING THE GENERAL TREND IS TO DRAG 
THAT WEATHER FRONT BACK TO THE WEST 
QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD AND A DOTTING OF SHOWERS 
AS IT HEADS WEST MORE OF EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST 
DRY AND SUNNY WITH TEMPERATURES AT TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO 
THE WEATHER FRONT STILL ACROSS NORTH ENGLAND THROUGH THE PENNINES 
AND THE WELSH BORDERS 
BUT NOT REALLY BACK INTO THE BODY OF SCOTLAND 
WE COULD WELL SEE TWENTY DEGREES IN THE HEART OF GLASGOW 
NOT FAR BEHIND BELFAST EIGHTEEN DEGREES BUT WITH A CHANCE OF SOME FOG 
JUST LAPPING INTO THE SHORES OF ANTRIM AND DOWN 
AND ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF WALES WITH SOME SHOWERS JOINING IN 
TEMPERATURES IN CARDIFF UP TO TWENTY DEGREES 
IT SHOULD STAY IN THE SOUTH WEST BUT WITH MIST AND MURK 
IT WILL FEEL THAT LITTLE BIT COOLER 
THE LAST OF THE FRONT ON THE FIRST PART OF TUESDAY STAGGERS OFF WEST 
TEMPERATURES DON'T REALLY FALL THAT MUCH OVERNIGHT SO A MILD ONE 
INTO TUESDAY NOT QUITE WALL TO WALL SUNSHINE BUT QUITE DECENT 
AS THE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM ACROSS THE NORTH SEA 
SEE WHAT IT'S DOING TO TEMPERATURES AWAY FROM THE EAST COAST 
THAT HIGH PRESSURE REALLY DOES BECOME A CENTRAL DRIVER 
OF THE BRITISH WEATHER IN MIDWEEK 
NOTICE HOW THE TEMPERATURES RESPOND 
TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR DEGREES QUITE LIKELY IN THE SOUTH EAST AND TWENTY FURTHER NORTH 
THAT'S HOW THINGS ARE AT THE MOMENT 
GLAD I BROUGHT YOU SOME GOOD NEWS DETAILS ON THE WEBSITE GOOD NIGHT 
PLAN'S GOOD 
MO I'M IN 
BOYS ARE BRIEFED 
AND HASN'T HE GOT A SAFE 
ABOUT AS SUBTLE AS A FLYING BRICK 
WAH AH AH 
WE'LL BE FINE YEAH I CAN DO THESE WITH ME EYES SHUT 
DO THE JOB WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A HITCH 
ARE YOU SURE 
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING 
IS IT ALWAYS WRONG TO LIE ABSOLUTELY
