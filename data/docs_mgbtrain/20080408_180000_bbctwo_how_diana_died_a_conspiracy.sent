SPEED CAR CRASH OR WAS THE

QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN SPARED THE 
DAILY OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS IN 
THE BRITISH COURT OF LAW DIANA'S 
BOYFRIEND DODI AL FAYED AND THEIR 
DRIVER HENRI PAUL WERE ALSO 
KILLED BUT DON'T BE'S GRIEVING 
FATHER STRUGGLED TO ACCEPT IT WAS

AND THE THREE YEAR BRITISH POLICE 
INVESTIGATION LED BY LORD STEVENS 
AGREED NOW A HIGH COURT JURY HAVE 
GIVEN THEIR VERDICT AFTER VISITING 
THE CRASH SITE AND LISTENING TO SIX 
MONTHS OF EVIDENCE THEY FOUND IT 
WAS UNLAWFUL KILLING BY THE 
PAPARAZZI AND HENRI PAUL SO HOW 
DID THEY REACH THIS VERDICT WILL 
THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES SURROUNDING 
DIANA'S DEATH BE PUT TO REST PARIS AUGUST THIRTIETH NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE RITZ HOTEL 
PRINCESS DIANA AND DODI AL FAYED 
HURRIED INTO THE HOTEL OWNED BY 
DODI'S FATHER HOUNDED BY THE 
PAPARAZZI THEY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO 
ABANDON PLANS FOR A ROMANTIC MEAL 
AT AN EXCLUSIVE RESTAURANT DODI 
DECIDES TO TAKE PRINCESS DIANA BACK 
TO HIS APARTMENT JUST OFF THE 
CHAMPS ELYSEES HENRI PAUL THE 
DEPUTY HEAD OF SECURITY IT IS 
CALLED BACK TO DRIVE DISTRESSED 
COUPLE A PLAN TO AVOID THE 
PAPARAZZI IS HATCHED BUT THE 
PHOTOGRAPHERS ARE NOT FOOLED AND 
GIVE CHASE 
RATHER THAN TAKING THE DIRECT ROUTE 
TO DODI'S APARTMENT THE MERCEDES 
TRIES TO OUTRUN THE PAPARAZZI THEY 
HAD FOUGHT A DUEL CARRIAGEWAY BY 
THE RIVER SEINE HEAD FOR 
FOUR MINUTES LATER THE CAR ENTERS 
THE ALMA TUNNEL 
DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES HAS DIED 
AFTER A CAR CRASH IN PARIS 
THIS IS 
C. N. N. BREAKING NEWS 
IN PARIS FRANCE 
A TRAGEDY PRINCESS DIANA HAS BEEN 
IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT 
DODI AL 
FAYED AND THE CAR'S CHAUFFEUR WERE 
KILLED IN THE ACCIDENT THE 
BODYGUARD WAS ALSO BADLY INJURED 
PRINCESS DIANA'S DEATH WAS MET WITH 
AN OUTPOURING OF PUBLIC GRIEF 
DIANA WAS JUST THIRTY SIX YEARS OLD SHE 
HAD LEFT BEHIND A TWO YOUNG SONS 
WITHIN HOURS OF THE CRASH A 
ELABORATE CONSPIRACY THEORISTS 
STARTED TO APPEAR ON THE INTERNET 
SUGGESTING PRINCESS DIANA WAS 
MURDERED SCEPTICS SEIZED ON HER 
UNHAPPY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
WINDSORS SINCE HER MARRIAGE HAD 
DISINTEGRATED SHE BELIEVED SHE HAD 
BECOME A THORN IN THE SIDE OF THE 
ESTABLISHMENT 
PEOPLE'S AGENDAS ESTABLISHMENT CHANGED OVERNIGHT L. WAS NOW THE 
SEPARATED WIFE OF THE PRINCE OF 
WALES I WAS A PROBLEM A LIABILITY 
IT SEEMED AS HOW ARE WE GOING TO 
DEAL WITH HER 
SHE HAD REFUSED TO 
FADE AWAY SHE CHAMPIONED 
CONTROVERSIAL CAUSES CAMPAIGNING 
AGAINST THE USE OF LANDMINES 
AND THAT SUMMER SHE HAD FOUND A 
NEW BOYFRIEND FROWNED ON IN ROYAL 
CIRCLES THE 
FORMER ROYAL 
CORRESPONDENT 
NOEL BOTHAM WAS IMMEDIATELY 
SUSPICIOUS 
DIANA WAS FEARFUL OF SUSPICIOUS HER OWN DEATH FOR THE LAST FEW 
YEARS OF HER LIFE RIGHT UP TO THE 
ACCIDENT SHE BELIEVED SOMEONE WAS 
OUT THERE TO GET HER 
BUT FRIENDS 
OF DIANA HAVE REFUSED TO ACCEPT 
CLAIMS THAT HER DEATH WAS ANYTHING 
OTHER THAN AN ACCIDENT 
IT IS 
ABSOLUTE RUBBISH L. THINK BECAUSE 
SHE WAS SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN 
PEOPLE FIND IT COMPLETELY 
UNACCEPTABLE THAT SOMEBODY LIKE 
THAT SHOULD HAVE SUCH AN ORDINARY 
DEATH A CAR CRASH L. THINK THAT IS WHAT THE PROBLEM IS 
THE DIANA CRASH INVESTIGATION WAS 
THE BIGGEST IN FRENCH HISTORY BUT 
FLAWS IN THEIR PROCEDURES WOULD FAN 
THE FLAMES OF CONSPIRACY AT FIRST 
THEY BLAMED THE PAPARAZZI FOR 
HOUNDING THE PRINCESS TO HER DEATH 
JACQUES LANGEVIN WAS ONE OF THE 
PHOTOGRAPHERS ARRESTED AFTER THE 
CRASH CRASH WE WERE BLAMED WELL 
WE WERE EXPOSED TO PUBLIC 
CONDEMNATION EVERYONE THE PEOPLE 
FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE POLICE 
EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS THE 
PHOTOGRAPHERS IT WAS THEIR FAULT 
THAT IS ALL THEY ARE IN CUSTODY 
EASY 
THE PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE EASY RELEASED AFTER THREE DAYS SOMEONE 
ELSE HAD BEEN FOUND TO BLAME 
JUST EIGHT HOURS AFTER THE ACCIDENT 
THE FRENCH POLICE CARRIED OUT A 
POST MORTEM HERE AT THE MEDICAL 
LEGAL INSTITUTE ON THE BODY OF 
HENRI PAUL THE DRIVER OF THE 
MERCEDES TESTS SHOWED CLEARLY HE 
HAD BEEN DRINKING THE RESULTS WERE 
MEANT TO BE CONFIDENTIAL BUT WERE 
LEAKED TO THE PRESS 
THE MAN 
DRIVING THE PRINCESS OF WALES' CAR 
WAS THREE TIMES OVER THE FRENCH 
DRINK DRIVE LIMIT HENRI PAUL WHO 
ALSO DIED IS NOW THE CENTRE OF 
INVESTIGATIONS BY FRENCH POLICE 
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS BELIEVE THE 
LINK WAS DESIGNED TO CLOSE THE CASE 
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE COVER UP 
FOR A SINISTER PLOT 
RIGHT FROM THE 
VERY BEGINNING AT THE POLICE 
DECIDED THEY HAD AN EASY SCAPEGOAT 
A MAN WHO IS DEAD A MAN WHO COULD 
NOT ARGUE BACK IT WAS A SET UP 
THEY WANTED TO BLAME THIS MAN THIS 
NEWS WENT AROUND THE WORLD AND HE 
WAS INSTANTLY LABELLED A KILLER OF 
PRINCESS DIANA 
MOHAMMAD AL FAYED 
THE EGYPTIAN MULTI MILLIONAIRE 
OWNER OF HARRODS AND THE RITZ 
COULD NOT ACCEPT THE OFFICIAL 
VERSION OF EVENTS HENRI PAUL WAS 
HIS EMPLOYEES HE CALLED A PRESS 
CONFERENCE SHORTLY AFTER THE CRASH 
HIS SPOKESMAN MICHAEL COLE SAID 
HE COULD SHOW THAT THE DRIVER WAS 
NOT DRUNK 
HENRI PAUL DID NOT HAVE 
THE APPEARANCE OF BEING OVER 
EXCITED DRUNK AS A PIG A 
QUOTATION WHICH INCIDENTALLY 
APPEARS AGAIN IN THE EVENING 
STANDARD YOU WILL SEE THE EVIDENCE 
FOR YOURSELF 
BEFORE THE WORLD'S 
PRESS THEY RELEASED C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE 
FROM THE RITZ 
THE SECURITY MANAGER 
NEXT WILL BE THE CONCIERGE FINALLY 
HENRI PAUL HENRI PAUL HAD LEFT THE 
RITZ AT AROUND SEVEN P. M. ON THE NIGHT OF 
THE CRASH HE HAD BEEN OFF DUTY FOR 
THREE HOURS THE FRENCH POLICE 
CHECKED AT THE BARS CLOSE TO HIS 
HOME NEAR THE HOTEL BUT NO 
WITNESSES HAD SEEN HIM DRINKING AS 
THE C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE SHOWED HE HAD 
RETURNED TO THE HOTEL AT TEN P. M. 
PARKING HIS MINI EFFORT TO SLEEP 
OUTSIDE THE FRONT OF THE RITZ 
ROYAL BIOGRAPHER NICHOLAS DAVIES 
FOUND THE FOOTAGE PERSUASIVE 
EFFORTLESSLY 
THERE WAS NO EFFORTLESSLY SUGGESTION AT ALL IN ANY OF THE 
PICTURES I HAVE SEEN TO SUGGEST 
THAT HE WAS NOT STONE COLD SOBER 
THIS MAN BENDS DOWN TIES ONE 
SHOELACE CHANGES FOOT A TIE IS 
ANOTHER SHOE LACE AND GETS UP IF 
HE HAD BEEN DRINKING THAT AMOUNT OF 
ALCOHOL HE WOULD HAVE BEEN FALLING 
OVER HE WAS NOT SO HOW ON EARTH 
DO THE AUTHORITIES SAY THIS MAN WAS 
DRUNK 
THEIR REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THE 
OFFICIAL VERSION GAINED MOMENTUM 
AMERICAN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST 
GERALD POSNER SUGGESTED THE HIGH 
ALCOHOL READING COULD HAVE BEEN 
WRONG 
I SAW CONFIDENTIAL REPORTS WRONG FROM THE FIRST AUTOPSY OF HENRI 
PAUL IT WAS RIDDLED WITH ERRORS 
AND OMISSIONS EVERYTHING FROM 
WHERE THE BLOOD WAS TAKEN FROM EVEN 
TO WEAR THE BLOB WAS REFRIGERATED 
FOR SEVERAL HOURS THE BODY IT 
RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW 
EFFICIENT THIS AUTOPSY WAS SERIOUS SERIOUS ERRORS WERE MADE AT THE MORGUE 
WHICH FRENCH OFFICIALS INITIALLY 
DENIED HENRI PAUL'S BLOOD SAMPLES 
WERE NOT LABELLED CORRECTLY THERE 
WAS NO RECORD AS TO WHO HAD ACCESS 
TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON BLOOD 
FROM PARTS OF THE BODY WHICH COULD 
YIELD INACCURATE RESULTS SCEPTICS 
MAINTAINED THE BLOOD WAS TAMPERED 
WITH TO FRAME THE DEAD DRIVER 
PROFESSOR ROBERT FORREST IS A 
LEADING FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST WHO 
ANALYSED THE DATA THE JURY HEARD 
HIS ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST POST 
MORTEM 
A IT WAS CARRIED OUT AS A MORTEM MATTER OF URGENCY AT SHORT NOTICE 
IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING 
THE WAYS IN WHICH THE SAMPLES WERE 
COLLECTED AND IDENTIFIED WERE 
PERHAPS LESS THAN OPTIMAL THAT 
WOULD BE THE KINDEST WAY TO PUT IT 
WITHIN DAYS OF THE CRASH FRENCH 
OFFICIALS REALISED THE CONTROVERSY 
OVER WHETHER HENRI PAUL WAS DRUNK 
OR NOT WAS GETTING OUT OF HAND 
THEY ORDERED THE BLOOD TEST TO BE 
REPEATED THOUGH THE RECORD KEEPING 
WAS IMPERFECT THE RESULTS WERE 
DIFFERENT SIMILAR TO THE FIRST 
TEST HE WAS THREE TIMES OVER THE 
FRENCH LIMIT THE TESTS ALSO 
REVEALED TRACES OF DRUG USED TO 
TREAT ALCOHOLICS THE CONCENTRATION 
SHOULD SUGGESTED HE HAD BEEN 
TAKING IT FOR THREE MONTHS ALONG 
WITH THE ANTI DEPRESSANT PROZAC 
CLAUDE GARREC WAS HENRI PAUL'S BEST 
FRIEND HE TESTIFIED THAT HIS 
FRIEND WAS A REGULAR SOCIAL DRINKER 
AND HAD A VERY HIGH TOLERANCE FOR 
ALCOHOL HE CONCEDED THAT HENRI 
PAUL WOULD SOMETIMES DRIVE AFTER 
DRINKING DRINKING AS FAR AS I AM 
CONCERNED MY FRIEND WAS A 
RESPONSIBLE PERSON AND IF HE DROVE 
THAT MIGHT WHATEVER HIS BLOOD 
ALCOHOL LEVEL THAT MEANS HE WAS 
CAPABLE OF DOING SO L. AM NOT 
SAYING THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE HE HAD 
A DRINK L. AM SAYING THAT EVEN IF 
HE HAD THAT IS NOT THE CAUSE OF 
THE ACCIDENT 
IF YOU ARE 
INTOXICATED WITH ALCOHOL OR YOU 
HAVE DRUNK AND AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL 
AND YOU ARE A REGULAR HEAVY DRINKER 
YOUR BLOOD ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION 
GOES UP TO AROUND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLIGRAMS OF 
ALCOHOL PER ONE HUNDRED MILITARY LITRES OF 
BLOOD YOU MAY BE ABLE TO FUNCTION 
UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES M. M. 
YOU COULD DRIVE YOUR CAR TO AND 
FROM WORK BUT IF SOMETHING GOES 
WRONG SOMETHING HAPPENS ON THAT 
TRIP YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COPE 
AS YOU WOULD UNDER NORMAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES 
IT SEEMED CLEAR CUT CIRCUMSTANCES BUT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FORENSIC 
EVIDENCE WOULD NOT GO AWAY SAMPLES 
OBTAINED FROM BOTH POST MORTEMS 
CONTAINED UNUSUALLY HIGH LEVELS OF 
CARBON MONOXIDE 
IF YOU HAVE CARBON 
MONOXIDE IN THE BLOOD OF TWENTY FOUR PER CENT YOU 
CANNOT WALK L. AM CERTAIN THAT WAS 
IN HENRI PAUL'S BLOOD A DRUNKEN 
DRIVER IT IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE 
THE CONSPIRACY THEORISTS BELIEVE 
THE BLOOD SAMPLES WERE SWITCHED I I WAS TOLD THERE WERE TWENTY TWO PEOPLE WHO 
DIED IN PARIS THAT MIGHT WHICH 
WILL INVESTIGATE DOUBLE DEATHS FOR 
ONE REASON OR ANOTHER ONE OF THEM 
WAS A MAN WHO HAD DRUNK HALF A 
BOTTLE OR MORE OF VODKA WAS SAT IN 
HIS CAR HE TIED A HOSEPIPE FROM 
THE EXHAUST TO THE INSIDE AND HE 
KILLED HIMSELF WITH CARBON MONOXIDE 
POISONING THAT MAN'S BLOOD 
ACCORDING TO THE POLICE SPOKESMAN 
WAS THE BLOOD THAT WAS SUBSTITUTED 
FOR HENRI PAUL'S 
THE HEAD OF THE FRENCH JUDICIOUS 
POLICE WHO INVESTIGATED THE CRASH 
IS OUTRAGED BY THE SUGGESTION 
THESE STORIES OF SWITCHED TEST TUBES ARE NONSENSE 
HENRI PAUL'S BLOOD SAMPLES HAVE 
NEVER BEEN SWITCHED 
SHE SAYS 
FRAMING HENRI PAUL WOULD HAVE 
REQUIRED A HUGE CONSPIRACY 
CORRUPTING A WHOLE CHAIN OF POLICE 
AND FORENSIC INVESTIGATORS 
THE PEOPLE AT THE CRIMINAL BRIGADE THE MORGUE AND 
THE TO GO KOLINGY DEPARTMENTS ARE 
ALL HIGHLY RESPECTED PEOPLE THEY 
HAVE WORKED ON IMPORTANT CRIME 
SCHEMES TERRORIST ATTACK YOU 
THINK THEY WOULD COMPROMISE 
THEMSELVES BY SWITCHING BLOOD 
SAMPLES 
I THINK ONE CAN BE TOTALLY SAMPLES CONFIDENT THAT THOSE SAMPLES CAME 
FROM THE BODY WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED 
AS BEING THE BODY OF HENRI PAUL 
BUT I GUESS A SIN TILL LA OF DOUBT 
MAY RE REMAIN IN SOME PEOPLE'S 
MINDS 
THE JURY ACCEPTED HENRI PAUL MINDS HAD BEEN DRINKING THE COURT SHOWED 
C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE OF HENRI PAUL TALKING 
TO PAPARAZZI OUTSIDE THE RITZ 
BEFORE THE FATAL JOURNEY SOME SAY 
HE WAS TAUNTING THEM 
MAYBE HE WAS A BIT EXCITED HE WAS 
A BIT EXUBERANT THOUGHT HE WAS 
STRANGE I THOUGHT THAT FOR SOMEONE 
FROM SECURITY HE WAS SHOWING OFF 
TOO MUCH 
MOST OF THE PAPARAZZI 
REFUSED TO APPEAR IN COURT BUT IN 
STATEMENTS READ TO THE JURY SOME 
CLAIMED HENRI PAUL WAS CLEARLY 
DRUNK THE JURY ALSO HEARD THAT HE 
HAD DEFINITELY BEEN DRINKING THAT 
NIGHT THOUGH THE RITZ HAD 
INITIALLY DENIED IT STAFF AT THE 
HOTEL'S BAR TOLD THE INQUEST HE HAD 
DRINK TWO RICARDSS THERE 
EQUIVALENT TO FOUR WHISKEYS THE 
BLOOD TEST SHOWS HE MUST HAVE DRUNK 
EVEN 
MORE AS 
MUCH AS 
ANOTHER 
BOTTLE 
OF WINE 
THE 
JURY WAS 
SO 
CONVINCED THEY 
FOUND THAT HENRI 
PAUL'S DRIVING WAS GROSSLY 
NEGLIGENT AND PARTLY RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE 
UNLAWFUL KILLING OF 
DIANA 
FOR THE UNLAWFUL KILLING OF DIANA AND DODI BUT FOR THE 
DOUBTERS THE 
CARBON 
MONDAY KNOCK 
SIDE LEVELS 
THE SAMPLES HAVE NEVER BEEN 
EXPLAINED THERE IS 
SINISTER ABOUT 
THIS SAYS MARYNA 
PROSKURINA IT IS COCK UP NOT 
CONSPIRACY POSNER 
THERE WERE 
OFFICIALS MADE IN EVERY AUTOPSY 
BUT THE FRENCH HAVE GIVEN A GO 
AHEAD TO THE CONSPIRACY 
WHO BELIEVE THEY ARE HIDING A 
MURDER MURDER IT WAS SEVEN MINUTES PAST MIDNIGHT 
WHEN DODI AND DIANA PLAN TO LEAVE 
THE RITZ THEY 
LEAVE FROM THE 
BACK 
ENTRANCE HENRI 
PAUL WAS 
TO 
BUT HE WASN'T 
A CHAUFFEUR THERE 
WOULD BE NO BACKUP VEHICLE ONLY 
ONE OF 
THE BODYGUARDS 
WITH THE COUPLE 
TREVOR REES 
HE WOULD BE THE SOLE SURVIVOR OF 
THE CRASH THE OTHER BODYGUARD 
WOULD LEAVE FROM THE FRONT IN A 
DECOY CAR IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO 
EVADE THE PAPARAZZI BUT QUESTIONS 
WOULD BE RAISED ABOUT WHO CAME ONE 
THIS EXIT PLAN CONSPIRACY 
THEORISTS SAID HENRI PAUL WAS 
SECRET SERVICE ACTIVIST ACTING 
UNDER THE INTELLIGENCE OF HIS 
MINDERS THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE TO 
DODI'S APARTMENT WAS ALONG THE 
CHAMPS ELYSEES BUT HENRI PAUL SET 
OFF IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION 
HEADING WEST TOWARDS THE ALMA 
TUNNEL HE COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDING 
THE HEAVY TRAFFIC 
ON THE 
CHAMPS 
ELYSEES THAT 
THEORISTS BELIEVE 
HE WAS 
ORDERED TO 
TAKE THIS ROUTE 
HENRI PAUL IS 
WHAT TO 
DO PRESUMABLY BY THE FRENCH 
SECRET SERVICE WHY 
WOULD HE BE 
TOLD THAT THERE IS 
ONLY ONE REASON 
BECAUSE SOMETHING 
MAINTAIN VERY 
WAS PLANNED WAS A KILLING OF DIANA 
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS 
SEIZED ON HIS 
BANK 
DETAILS HE 
HAD FIFTEEN SEPARATE 
BANK ACCOUNTS HAD MADE UNEXPLAINED 
DEPOSITS OF FORTY THOUSAND IN THE LAST 
EIGHT MONTHS OF HIS LIFE AND HE 
HAD MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND IN CASH ON HIM 
AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH PAYMENT 
SAY SOME FROM THE INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICES BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM 
WITH THE CONSPIRACY IT IS 
POTENTIALLY A SUICIDE MISSION IT 
REQUIRES HENRI PAUL TO BE BOTH 
PERPETRATOR AND PASTSY OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY HE WAS TRICKED AS MUCH AS DODI AND 
DIANA HE DIDN'T TAKE THAT ROUTE 
KNOWING HE WAS GOING TO DIE 
CLEARLY CLEARLY JEAN CLAUDE MULES WAS A COMMANDER 
OF THE FRENCH POLICE'S CRIMINAL 
BRIGADE HE INVESTIGATED HENRI 
PAUL'S LINKS TO THE SECRET SERVICE 
AND FOUND HE WAS A LOW LEVEL 
INFORMANT FOR THE FRENCH POLICE 
THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF SECURITY AT A LARGE PARISIAN 
HOTEL AUTOMATICALLY HAS CONTACTS 
GOOD CONTACTS WITH THE POLICE HE 
WILL KNOW THE IMPORTANT PEOPLE WHO 
ARE COMING IN AND OUT OF PARIS BUT 
TO SAY THAT EVERY MONTH HE RECEIVES 
A FAT ENVELOPE FROM THE SECRET 
SERVICES IN MY OPINION IS JUST 
ABSURD ABSURD AT THE INQUEST THE JURY HEARD THERE 
MIGHT BE AN INNOCENT EXPLANATION 
FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING INTO 
HIS BANK ACCOUNTS I I THINK THAT THE MONEY IN HIS 
ACCOUNTS CAME FROM HIS SALARY AND 
ALSO FROM THE TIPS THAT HE WAS 
EARNING THAT HE USED TO RECEIVE 
FROM CUSTOMERS AT THE HOTEL WHO 
WERE SATISFIED WITH HIS SERVICE L. 
CAN'T IMAGINE HE COULD HAVE GOT 
THIS MONEY FROM A FOREIGN SECRET 
SERVICE 
THE JURY ALSO HEARD THAT SERVICE THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE 
M. I SIX HAD OPENED ITS FILES TO 
INVESTIGATORS THERE WAS NO FILES 
FOUND ON HENRI PAUL AND M. I SIX SAID 
THEY KNEW NOTHING OF DIANA'S 
PRESENCE IN PARIS UNTIL AFTER THE 
CRASH CRASH BUT SUSPICIONS HAD BEEN RAISED 
ABOUT SECRET SERVICE INVOLVEMENT IN 
THE DEATHS NOW CONSPIRACY 
THEORISTS NEEDED A MOTIVE SEVERAL 
MONTHS AFTER THE CRASH MOHAMED AL 
FAYED CAME UP WITH A STARTLING 
CAMPAIGN 
THEY CAME SAID THEY CAMPAIGN WERE HAVING DINNER AND GOING BACK 
TO THE APARTMENT AND COMING BACK 
ON SUNDAY AND DECLARING THEIR 
ENGAGMENT ON MONDAY 
DID 
DODI TELL YOU THAT DODI AND DIANA 
TOLD ME THAT ON SATURDAY EVENING AT 
TEN POINT OH OH ONE THOUSAND THE POSSIBILITY OF DIANA MARRYING 
DODI AL FAYED CHALLENGED EVERY 
SINGLE IDEA OF THE BRITISH MONARCHY 
OR EVERY TRADITIONAL IDEA OF THE 
BRITISH MONARCHY 
SO WERE THEY 
REALLY ABOUT TO BE MARRIED IN JULY 
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN SHE HAD ACCEPTED AN INVITATION 
FROM MOHAMED AL FAYED TO TAKE HER 
TWO YOUNG SONS ON HOLIDAY WITH HIS 
FAMILY IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE A 
NEW ROMANCE BEGAN BETWEEN DODI AND 
DIANA THE PRESS SPECULATED THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP COULD BE SERIOUS ON 
AUGUST THIRTIETH THE COUPLE ARRIVED IN 
PARIS AL FAYED CLAIMED THE COUPLE 
HAD CHOSEN A RING IN THE SOUTH OF 
FRANCE FROM REPOSSI JEWELLERS THEY 
WERE TO ANNOUNCE THEIR ENGAGMENT ON 
MONDAY HAD DIANA FOUND HER MR. 
RIGHT AT LAST THE JURY SAW 
EFFUSIVE THANK YOU LETTERS DIANA 
HAD WRITTEN TO DODI SHE DESCRIBED 
THE HOLIDAY AS THE MOST MAGICAL SIX 
DAYS AND AN OH MY GOD SITUATION 
AND THANKS FOR BRINGING JOY INTO 
THIS CHICK'S LIFE THE JEWELER MR. 
REPOSSI BACKED UP MR. AL FAYED'S 
CLAIM THAT THE COUPLE WERE SECRETLY 
ENGAGED HE SAID THEY HAD CHOSEN 
THE RING TOGETHER IT WAS RESIZED 
AND COLLECTED IN PARIS ON THE DAY 
OF THEIR DEATH BUT THE ASSISTANT 
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE RITZ COLIN 
POWELL HAD A GIVEN STORY JOHN 
POLLARD HAD A DIFFERENT STORY TO 
CLAUDE ROULET HAD A DIFFERENT 
STORY TO TELL HE ACCOMPANIED DODI 
TO HELP CHOOSE A RING FOR DIANA 
HAD HADN'T ALREADY BEEN SELECTED 
AND RESIZED 
DODI WAS SHOPPING AND 
MAKING A CHOICE HE WAS NOT HAPPY 
WITH WHAT HE SAW IT WAS VERY HARD 
FOR HIM TO DECIDE HE ASKED ME TO 
GIVE MY IMPRESSION MY IDEAS AND 
THEN HE PUT APART ABOUT FIVE PIECES 
AND SAID O. K. ALL THE REST IS NOT 
INTERESTING 
WHEN DODI DID FINELY INTERESTING SET ON A CHOICE IT WAS THE 
CHEAPEST OF THE RINGS CONSIDERED 
BUT WAS IT A DISCOUNTED ENGAGMENT 
RING 
WE WERE CLOSE ENOUGH FOR HIM RING TO TELL ME I'M GOING TO BUY AN 
ENGAGMENT RING HE NEVER SAID THIS 
HE NEVER SAID THIS IT WAS A 
PRESENT IT WAS NOT AN ENGAGMENT 
RING 
AT THE INQUEST THERE WAS NO RING HARD EVIDENCE TO BACK UP MOHAMED AL 
FAYED'S CLAIM THAT THE COUPLE WERE 
ENGAGED THE JURY HAD TO BALANCE 
HIS WORD AGAINST THE WORDS OF MANY 
OF DIANA'S FRIENDS SOME SAID SHE 
TOLD THEM SHE WANTED MARRIAGE LIKE 
A RASH ON THE FACE OTHERS THAT HER 
PREVIOUS BOYFRIEND THE HEART 
SURGEON HASNET KHAN WAS REALLY 
HER MR. WONDERFUL 
ONE OF THE LAST PEOPLE DIANA SPOKE 
TO WAS HER FRIEND THE DAILY MAIL 
JOURNALIST RICHARD KAY SHE HAD 
RUNG HIM THE NIGHT SHE DIED SHE SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS HAPPY WITH HIM HE 
WAS RELAXED EASY GOING I DON'T 
THINK SHE PLANNED AN IMMINENT 
MARRIAGE SHE CONSTANTLY MADE THE 
POINT TO ME THAT SUMMER LOOK I'VE 
JUST GOT OUT OF ONE MARRIAGE I'M 
NOT ABOUT TO HOP INTO ANOTHER ONE 
I THINK THAT WAS PROBABLY VERY MUCH 
IN HER THINKING IF SHE WAS GOING 
TO MARRY ANYONE IT HAD SEEMED TO ME 
THAT SHE MIGHT MARRY HASNET KHAN 
DIANA'S CLOSE FRIEND ROSA MONCKTON 
HAD SPENT A WEEK WITH HER THAT 
AUGUST SHE HAD DISCUSSED THE NEW 
MAN IN HER LIFE 
SHE TALKED ABOUT 
HIM IN MY VIEW IT WAS VERY MUCH A 
FLING THAT MOST OF US HAVE IN OUR 
TEEN BUT SHE DIDN'T BECAUSE SHE 
WAS ENGAGED AT NINETEEN SHE DID SAY THAT 
HE HAD GIVEN HER A LOT OF PRESENTS 
ALMOST TOO MANY PRESENTS AND SHE 
SAID I KNOW THERE IS A RING HE'S 
TOLD ME THERE'S A RING SHE SAID 
IT'S GOING VERY FIRMLY ON MY RIGHT 
HAND SO NO SHE WASN'T 
CONTEMPLATING MARRIAGE WITH HIM 
SOON AFTER THE ACCIDENT A WITNESS 
CAME FORWARD WHO CLAIMED TO BE 
DRIVING THROUGH THE TUNNEL ON THE 
NIGHT HIS STORY NEATLY FITTED THE 
CONSPIRACY OF SECRET SERVICE 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRASH ON AN I. T. V. 
PROGRAMME HE WAS QUESTIONED AND 
CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN MASSIVE 
FLASH OF LIGHT BEFORE THE ACCIDENT 
THE FLASH WAS THIS FLASH 
LIKE A PHOTO FLASH NO NO IT WAS STRONGER THAN A PHOTO FLASH 
THE MERCEDES GOES LEFT RIGHT LEFT 
I. T. N. ROYAL CORRESPONDENT AT THE TIME 
NICK OWEN DEVELOPED THE THEORY 
THIS IS AN ANTI PERSONNEL DEVICE 
LEGAL TO BUY IN THE U. K. WHICH SETS 
OFF ONE ENOR NEWSLY POWERFUL FLASH 
OF LIFE PUT THIS IN SOMEONE'S EYES 
THEY WILL STUNNED AND DISABLED FOR 
SEVERAL MINUTES 
SO WAS THIS FLASH 
GUN THE SPOOKS WEAPON OF CHOICE A 
FORMER SPY GAVE CREDENCE TO THE 
THEORY RICHARD TOMLINSON CAME 
FORWARD WITH THE CLAIM THAT M. I SIX 
PLANNED TO USE THIS PIECE OF KIT TO 
KILL SLOBODON MILOSEVIC AND THIS 
ACCIDENT WAS STRAIGHT OUT OF AN M. I SIX 
TEXTBOOK 
I PUT TWO AND TWO THINGS TEXTBOOK TOGETHER THAT WAS ONE OF THE 
PROPOSALS USED IN THE MILOSEVIC 
DOCUMENT THE LIGHT IN THE TUNNEL 
MADE ME THINK MAYBE IT WASN'T AN 
ACCIDENT ACCIDENT MOHAMED AL FAYED WAS CONVINCED HE 
HAD DISCOVERED THE METHOD BY WHICH 
M. I SIX MURDERED PRINCESS DIANA AND HIS 
SON 
IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT IT IS A SON MURDER AND A VERY TRAGIC MURDER 
THE CAR WHEN THEY LEFT THE RITZ 
WAS BEING FOLLOWED UP BY M. I SIX ONE 
OF THE MOTORCYCLES WITH A FLOOD 
LIGHT BLINDED HENRI PAUL THIS IS 
DEFINITELY EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
THE WORLD'S MEDIA SEIZED ON THE 
CONSPIRACY STORY BUT POLICE HAD 
IMMEDIATE DOUBTS 
IF THERE HAD BEEN A FLASH IT WOULD HAVE BLINDED NOT 
ONLY THE DRIVER OF THE MERCEDES 
BUT THE DRIVER IN THE FIAT UNO AND 
THE PAPARAZZI TOO EVERYBODY WOULD 
HAVE CRASHED INTO EACH OTHER AT THE 
SAME TIME IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE 
HE CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN THE FLASH 
OF LIGHT IN HIS CAREER VIEW MIRROR 
WHILE TRAVELLING AT OVER SIXTY MILES 
AN HOUR THROUGH THE TUNNEL 
THAT WITNESS WAS HEARD AND HIS 
THE INQUEST HEARD EVIDENCE FROM 
MORE THAN BY WITNESSES TO THE 
CRASH BUT ONLY ONE OTHER WITNESS 
SUPPORTED FRANCOIS LE BISTRO'S 
CLAIM TO SEE MASSIVE FLASH OF 
LIGHT A HANDFUL HAD SEEMED LIGHT 
BUT MOST ASSUMED IT WAS FROM 
PAPARAZZI CAMERAS OR CAR HEADLIGHT 
BUT THIS WAS AN ASSASSINATION 
METHOD WHICH M. I SIX WOULD OR COULD 
HAVE APPROVED SUCH WAS THE POWER 
OF THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES THE 
INQUEST PERSUADED THE FORMER HEAD 
OF M. I SIX SO RICHARD DEARLOVE TO 
GIVE EVIDENCE ALONG WITH TEN OTHER 
OFFICERS HE SAID M. I SIX HAD NOT 
ASSASSINATED ANYONE IN THE THIRTY EIGHT YEARS 
HE HAD WORKED THERE HE SAID THAT 
IN THE NINETIES PLAN HAD DRAWN UP TO 
ASSASSINATE AS SERB WARLORD NOT 
MILOSEVIC BUT THE PLAN HAD BEEN 
KILLED STONE DEAD BY SENIOR 
OFFICERS OR STOCK ASSASSINATION 
COULD ONLY BE APPROVED AT A TIME 
OFF WAR OR OTHER EXCEPTIONAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES OFFICERS PHILIP 
DAVIES HAS BEEN OBSERVING THE 
INQUEST 
IT IS LUNACY IT IS INQUEST ABSOLUTELY SURREAL IN NO WAY CAN 
YOU MAKE AN ISSUE TO DO WITH WHOM 
THE DIVORCE PRINCESS OF WALES 
HAPPENS TO BE SLEEPING WITH OR 
PLANNING TO MARRY AS CIRCUMSTANCES 
FOR A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY 
BUT RICHARD TOMLINSON BACKTRACKED 
ON HIS STORY HE SAID THE PLANS IS 
OR MAY NOT HAVE INVOLVED MILOSEVIC 
FLASHING LIGHTS OR EVEN CAR CRASH 
IT IS AN IMPLAUSIBLE IDEA BUT FROM 
THE POINT OF VIEW OF MOUNTING ANY 
OPERATION IT IS ABOUT CONTROLLING 
THE OUTCOME ON NOT HAVING THINGS GO 
WRONG A FLASH LIKE THAT YOU HAVE 
VERY LITTLE CONTROL OF WHAT GOES ON 
SO YOU USE SOMETHING YOU CAN 
CONTROL THE OUTCOME OF YOU USE A 
GUN 
SIR RICHARD DENIED M. I SIX HAD GUN ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE DEATH 
SAYING IT WAS RIDICULOUS 
IMPOSSIBLE GOT OFF THE MAP 
IMPOSSIBLE GOT OFF THE MAP 
THROUGHOUT THE INVESTIGATION THERE 
HAS BEEN ONE CRUCIAL PIECE OF 
MISSING EVIDENCE IT BEGINS WITH 
COMMANDER MULES THAT IT HIT 
ANOTHER CAR BEFORE THE CRASH 
I FOUND ORANGE WHITE 
AND RED BITS OF PLASTIC ON THE 
GROUND THEY KNOW AND LIKE 
INDICATOR LIGHT THE DEBRIS WAS 
GROUPED TOGETHER IT WAS FRESH YOU 
COULD ASSUME IT WAS PROBABLY FROM 
THE COLLISION BETWEEN A MERCEDES 
AND ANOTHER CAR 
A TRAIL OF PAINT 
ON THE MERCEDES SUGGESTED IT CAME 
FROM A FIAT UNO WE HAVE 
RECONSTRUCTED THE ACCIDENT AS THE 
POLICE THINK IT HAPPENED AS THE 
MERCEDES SPEEDS AT SIXTY FIVE M. P. H. TOWARDS 
THE TUNNEL THE FIAT UNO COMES DOWN 
A SLIP ROAD THE MERCEDES LOSES 
CONTROL THEN CLIPS THE BACK OF THE 
FIAT UNO BEFORE THE CRASH FOR 
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS THE FIAT UNO 
HAS BEEN A SMOKING GUN IN THEIR 
VERSION OF EVENTS THE WHITE FIAT 
UNO AND AN UNKNOWN MOTORBIKE WERE 
WAITING FOR THE MERCEDES BETWEEN 
THEM THEY MANAGED TO FORCE THE 
BIGGER CAR INTO THE PILLAR WHAT NO 
ONE DOUBTS IS THAT THE MERCEDES DID 
HIT A FIAT UNO ITS DRIVER WAS A 
CRUCIAL WITNESS WHO COULD HELP 
DETERMINE WHETHER THE CRASH WAS 
REALLY AN ACCIDENT THE HUNT WAS ON 
TO FIND HIM 
FORENSIC TESTS REVEALED THE FIAT 
UNO MUST HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED 
BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THERE WERE 
TEN THOUSAND WHITE FIAT UNOS IN FRANCE 
THAT MATCHED THAT DESCRIPTION AND 
WERE STILL ON THE ROAD A PARTIAL 
NUMBERPLATE CITING LED THE FRENCH 
POLICE TO FOCUS ON TWO DISTRICT 
WEST OF PARIS THEY EXAMINED OVER 
FOUR THOUSAND VEHICLES IN THEIR SEARCH BUT 
THE CZECHS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL THE 
FRENCH POLICE CLOSED THE 
INVESTIGATION WITHOUT IDENTIFYING 
THE DRIVER 
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT 
THE FIAT UNO DRIVEN BY SOMEONE WHO 
HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH 
THE CRASH SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN 
FOUND AND IT DISAPPEARED INTO THIN 
AIR 
SIX MONTHS AFTER THE CRASH PRIVATE 
DETECTIVES WORKING FOR MOHAMMAD AL 
FAYED CAME UP WITH POSSIBLE 
DRIVER JAKE AND BENSON JAMES 
AND THEN FORCED JAMES AND DENSE 
AND HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE PACK 
FOLLOWING PRINCESS DIANA AND DODI 
AL FAYED IN SAINT TROPEZ CONSPIRACY 
THEORISTS BELIEVED HE HAD LINKS TO 
THE BRITISH SECRET SERVICES AND HE 
HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN OTHER 
ASSASSINATION PLOTS 
HE WAS BEING 
INVESTIGATED ACTIVELY BY FRENCH 
SPECIAL BRANCH WHO I HAD SPOKEN TO 
HE HAD THIS STRANGE HABIT OF BEING 
PRESENT WHEN PEOPLE EITHER 
COMMITTED SUICIDE OR WERE MURDERED 
HE WAS WITH THEM PROBABLY THE LAST 
PERSON TO SEE THEM OR PHOTOGRAPH 
THEM 
TONY COMITI HAD KNOWN HIM FOR THEM OVER TWENTY YEARS HE MADE A 
DOCUMENTARY ABOUT HIM AND FILMED 
HIM IN HIS WHITE FIAT UNO 
THE CAR COULDN'T GET 
IN SECOND GEAR IT HAD TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
MILES ON THE CLOCK NO INDICATORS 
AND NO BRAKES JAMES LEAST ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE 
MILES FROM PARIS LIVED THE CAR 
WAS IN SUCH BAD CONDITION HE WOULD 
HAVE HAD TO PUT IT ON TRAIN TO 
GET IT THERE 
THE FRENCH ELIMINATED 
HIM FROM THEIR INQUIRY TWO YEARS 
LATER HE WAS FOUND BURNT TO DEATH 
IN HIS CAR IN REMOTE COUNTRYSIDE 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILES AWAY FROM HIS HOME HE HE STARTED TO BOAST HE HAD BEEN THERE 
THE NIGHT DIANA DIED THAT HE KNEW 
THINGS OTHER PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW 
AND HE COULD TELL REAL STORY IF HE 
WANTED TO L. THINK THOSE REPORTS 
GOT OUT TO THE WRONG PEOPLE 
AT THE 
INQUEST DOZENS OF WITNESSES GAVE 
EVIDENCE ABOUT HIS POSSIBLE 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRASH THE JURY 
HEARD THAT SOME PAINT AND BUMPER 
SAMPLES FROM HIS CAR MATCHED THE 
MARKS FROM THE MERCEDES CARRYING 
PRINCESS DIANA BUT THE CAR SHOWED 
NO SIGNS OF HAVING BEEN INVOLVED IN 
AN ACCIDENT AND HE HAD AN ALIBI FOR 
THE NIGHT IN QUESTION HIS WIFE 
SAID JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT HE WAS 
WITH HER AT HOME ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILES SOUTH 
OF PARIS HE HAD TRAVELLED TO ORLY 
AIRPORT AND TAKEN A FLIGHT TO 
CORSICA THE JURY SAW AIRLINE 
TICKETS AND TOLL ROADS RECEIPTS TO 
BACK UP HIS STORY TOLL ROAD AND 
AS FOR HIS OWN DEATH TESTS FOUND 
HIGH LEVELS OF CARBON MONOXIDE IN 
HIS BLOOD SOME EXPERTS TOLD THE 
JURY THIS SUGGESTED HE WAS NOT 
KILLED BEFORE HAND HE MUST HAVE 
BEEN A LIGHT INSIDE THE BURNING CAR 
LONG ENOUGH TO INHALE FUMES 
ALIVE AND FRIENDS KNEW THAT 
SUICIDE WAS SOMETHING HE HAD 
CONTEMPLATED CONTEMPLATED JAMES AT PHOTO 
SESSION IN SAINT TROPEZ TOLD GROUP 
OF US ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHER WHOSE 
WIFE HAD BEEN UNFAITHFUL HE SAID 
IF THE SAME THING EVER HAPPENS TO 
ME I WILL COMMIT SUICIDE WILL 
HAVE MY LAST CIGAR AND SET MYSELF 
ON FIRE AND MYSTERIOUSLY HE DIED 
JUST LIKE THAT THREE YEARS LATER 
HIS WIFE TOLD THE JURY SHE HAD BEEN 
HAVING AN AFFAIR WHEN HER HUSBAND 
DIED SHE BELIEVED HE HAD COMMITTED 
SUICIDE IF IT WASN'T HIM WHO WAS 
IT THE MINISTRY OF THE WHITE FIAT 
UNO DRIVER HAS NOT BEEN SOLD AND 
POSSIBLY NEVER WILL BE SOLVED 
BUT WHOEVER WAS DRIVING COULD THIS 
FATAL CRASH HAVE BEEN STAGED TO 
KILL THE PRINCESS TRANSPORT 
EXPERTS LIKE MURRAY MACKAY ARE 
DOUBTFUL THEY SAY IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO ENGINEER A CRASH ESPECIALLY 
USING ONE SMALLER THAN THE TARGET 
CAR 
IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY WANTING TO CAR SHOULDER THEM OFF THE ROAD AT HIGH 
SPEED YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE A CAR 
AT LEAST AS HEAVY AS THAT 
PREFERABLY A LARGE TRUCK BUT ALSO 
MOVING AT A SPEED SIMILAR TO THE 
SPEED THAT THE MERCEDES WAS 
TRAVELLING I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T 
ATTEMPT TO DO IT WITH A FIAT UNO 
THAT IS BOUND TO FAIL 
EXPERTS TOLD 
THE JURY IT WAS THE DRIVER'S SPEED 
AND THE COMBINATION OF OTHER 
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MADE THIS CRASH 
SO DEVASTATING 
IT WAS A FATAL 
CRASH RATHER THAN A SURVIVAL CRASH 
BECAUSE IT HAPPENED IN THE ALMA 
TUNNEL BY HAVING THOSE INDIVIDUAL 
PILLARS AT THE FRONT OF THE CAR IS 
BROUGHT TO REST INSTANTANEOUSLY 
GENERATING ENORMOUSLY HIGH CRASH 
FORCES IF THEY HAD BEEN A GUARD 
RAIL OR A SOLID WALL YOU WOULD 
HAVE BEEN DEFLECTED AND THERE WOULD 
BE A SERIES OF MINOR SIDESWIPES 
AND EVERYBODY WOULD BE ALIVE AND 
WELL TODAY 
THE FOR THOSE CONVINCED 
THIS COLLISION WAS CONTRIVED TO 
KILL THE PRINCESS ONE SIMPLE FACT 
REMAINS HARD TO DEAL WITH 
IF DIANA 
HAD BEEN WEARING A SEATBELT THAT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN A PERFECTLY 
POSSIBLE COLLISION TO SURVIVE IF 
THE FORCES HAD BEEN DIMINISHED IN 
MY JUDGMENT THE CHANCES ARE SHE 
WOULD HAVE SURVIVED 
IN THEIR 
VERDICT THE JURY AGREED THAT THE 
FACT THE MERCEDES HIT THE PILLOW 
RATHER THAN THE WALL AND THE FACT 
THAT DIANA WAS NOT WEARING HIS 
SEATBELT BOTH CONTRIBUTED TO HER 
DEATH PELOUS AND THE PURSUING 
PAPARAZZI FRENCH POLICE TOLD THE 
COURT THEY HAD BEEN AT THE VERY 
LEAST A DISTRACTION 
THE PAPARAZZI PROBABLY 
PLAYED A SMALL PART IN THE CRUSHED 
BY THEIR ANNOYING AND PROVOKING 
PURSUIT THE CRASH THAT 
ANNOYANCE MUST HAVE BEEN PASSED ON 
FROM DODI AL FAYED TO HIS EMPLOYEE 
HENRI PAUL THIS MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY 
HE LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE A A HOST OF EYEWITNESSES SUGGESTED IN 
COURT THAT THE PAPARAZZI WERE 
DRIVING DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE 
MERCEDES SOUNDING THEIR HORNS AND 
TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS BUT THE JURY 
FOUND THE DRIVING OFF PAPARAZZI WAS 
GROSSLY NEGLIGENT AND CONTRIBUTED 
TO THE UNLAWFUL KILLING OF THE 
COUPLE IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH 
OF THE CRASH EVERY DETAIL OF WHAT 
HAPPENED WAS ANALYSED WORLDWIDE 
AMERICAN CONSPIRACY THEORISTS 
STARTED TO QUESTION THE MEDICAL 
TREATMENT PRINCESS DIANA RECEIVED 
THAT NIGHT 
FOR SOME AS YET UNEXPLAINED REASON 
IT TOOK ONE HOUR AND FORTY THREE MINUTES 
FROM THE TIME OF THE CRASH TO 
DELIVER DIANA TO ONE HOSPITAL THAT 
WAS A NEW THIRTY EIGHT MILES AWAY DIANA DIANA SURVIVE THE INITIAL IMPACT BUT 
COULD HER TREATMENT HAVE BEEN 
DELIBERATELY DELAYED TO ENSURE HER 
DEATH FRENCH EMERGENCY SERVICES 
ARRIVED JUST SIX MINUTES AFTER THE 
CRASH BUT IT WAS WELL OVER AN HOUR 
BEFORE DIANA BEGAN HER JOURNEY TO 
HOSPITAL AND WITNESSES WERE 
ASTONISHED TO SEE THE AMBULANCE 
TRAVELLING AT LITTLE OVER WALKING 
SPEED PROFESSOR ANDRE LIENHART HAS 
REVIEWED THE EMERGENCY SERVICES' 
RESPONSE HE TOLD THE INQUEST SHE 
HAD SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK WHILE 
BEING REMOVED FROM THE MERCEDES 
THE TRANSFER TO A 
HOSPITAL WAS DELIBERATELY SLOW 
BECAUSE FOR PEOPLE WHOSE BLOOD 
CIRCULATION IS VERY UNSTABLE WE 
KNOW EVEN SLIGHT ACCELERATION OR 
DECELERATION CAN CAUSE CARDIAC 
ARREST 
PRINCESS DIANA WAS TRANSFERRED TO A 
LA PITIE SALPIETRIE PASSING FIVE 
OTHER HOSPITALS THAT WERE CLOSER 
LA PITIE SALPIETRIE 
WAS CHOSEN FOR ITS EXPERTISE IN 
TREATING SERIOUS TRAUMA MOST 
IMPORTANTLY CHEST TRAUMA DIANA DIANA HAD SUFFERED A MASSIVE ATTACK IN 
THE MAIN PULMONARY VEIN TO HER 
HEART 
I DON'T THINK IT IS 
POSSIBLE TO STOP RUMOURS IF PEOPLE 
WANT TO BELIEVE IN CONSPIRACY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE THEM WRONG 
WHAT IS CLEAR FROM ALL THE MEDICAL 
STAFF AND PARAMEDICS WORKING THAT 
NIGHT IS THAT THEY WANTED TO SAVE 
THE PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM THAT 
IS ABSOLUTELY INDISPUTABLE 
IT'S NOW OVER TEN YEARS SINCE 
PRINCESS DIANA DIED PEOPLE FROM 
ALL OVER THE WORLD STILL TRAVEL TO 
THE ALMA TUNNEL TO PAY THEIR 
RESPECTS RESPECTS AND OVER THOSE YEARS CONSPIRACY 
THEORISTS HAVE SCOURED DOWN IN LIFE 
AS WELL AS DEATH FOR CLUES THAT 
MIGHT POINT TO HER MURDER AND THEY 
HAVE FOUND PLENTY TO FEED THEIR 
SUSPICIONS FOR DIANA HERSELF WAS 
SOMETHING OF A CONSPIRACY THEORIST 
SHE HAD BECOME INCREASINGLY 
CONCERNED THAT HER APARTMENT AT 
KENSINGTON PALACE WAS BUGGED SHE 
TOLD HER PRIVATE SECRETARY SHE 
FEARED HER BRAKES HAD BEEN TAMPERED 
WITH 
CERTAINLY IN THE PRINCESS'S WITH OWN MIND SHE WASN'T AT ALL SURE 
WHERE ANY THREAT TO HER MIGHT BE 
COMING FROM BUT IT CERTAINLY 
SEEMED LOGICAL THAT A THREAT MIGHT 
COME FROM THE PEOPLE SHE HAD 
OFFENDED THE ROYAL FAMILY 
SHE WAS IN VERY ISOLATED POSITION 
AT THAT STAGE SHE DID HAVE ENEMIES 
SHE HAD MADE ENEMIES 
THE EXTENT OF DIANA'S OWN FEARS 
BEGAN TO EMERGE AFTER HER DEATH 
PRINCESS DIANA'S FORMER BUTLER 
PAUL BURRELL SAID HE RECEIVED A 
LETTER FROM DIANA TEN MONTHS BEFORE 
SHE DIED IN WHICH SHE WROTE OF HER 
FEARS OF A PLOT TO KILL HER IN A 
ROAD ACCIDENT 
PAUL BURRELL HAD 
SOLD A SENSATIONAL STORY TO THE 
MIRROR DIANA HAD CLAIMED THE 
PRINCE OF WALES WAS PLANNING AN 
ACCIDENT IN HER CAR A BRAKE 
FAILURE 
AMAZINGLY DIANA PREDICTED FAILURE HER OWN DEATH AND HER OWN MURDER 
IF THAT IS THE CASE THIS IS THE 
MOST ENORMOUS SCANDAL TO HAVE HIT 
BRITAIN OVER THE LAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
PROBABLY PROBABLY FOR CONSPIRACY THEORISTS H. F. S. 
DYNAMITE BUT A FEW WEEKS LATER D. 
IT WAS DYNAMITE BUT FEW WEEKS 
LATER AN EVEN MORE EXTRAORDINARY 
PIECE OF INFORMATION CAME TO LIGHT 
IN OCTOBER NINETEEN NINETY FIVE DIANE IN HAD CALLED 
A MEETING IN KENSINGTON PALACE WITH 
HER SOLICITOR LORD MISHCON HE HAD 
KEPT A NOTE OF THE CONVERSATION 
THE PRINCESS HAD TOLD HER SHE 
THOUGHT THE QUEEN WOULD SOON BE 
ABDICATING AND THE PRINCE OF WALES 
WOULD BECOME KING BEFORE THAT HE 
WAS PLANNING TO GET RID OF DIANA 
POSSIBLY IN CAR ACCIDENT 
PATRICK JEPHSON WAS ALSO AT THE 
MEETING THE JURY HEARD FROM 
JEPHSON AND OTHER WITNESSES WHO 
SAID THE NOTE DIDN'T SUM UP 
NORMAL FRAME OF MIND 
IT IS ALWAYS 
PAINFUL TO REMEMBER IT NOW BUT 
THOSE WERE VERY UNHAPPY YEARS L. 
THINK THAT IN TALKING ABOUT SOME OF 
THESE FEARS THE PRINCESS WAS 
ALMOST TESTING THEM IT SEEMED TO 
ME THAT SHE WAS PERHAPS USING THIS 
OBJECTIVE AUDIENCE TO TEST OUT 
WHETHER OR NOT HER FEARS WERE WELL 
FOUNDED FOUNDED AS IT TURNED OUT MOST OF DIANA'S 
FEARS WERE NOT WELL FOUNDED SHE 
THOUGHT CAMILLA WAS ALSO IN DANGER 
AND CHARLES WANTED TO MARRY TIGGY 
LEGG BOURKE THE CHILDREN'S NANNY 
BUT IF THE NOTE ITSELF WERE NOT 
ENOUGH CONSPIRACY THEORISTS 
POUNCED ON WHAT THEY SAW AS A 
MASSIVE COVERING LORD MISHCON HAD 
PASSED THE NOTE ON TO THE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE IMMEDIATELY THE 
PRINCESS DIED BUT THE POLICE 
COMMISSIONER FIRST PAUL CONDON AND 
THEN LORD STEVENS HAD KEPT THE NOTE 
SECRET FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS THEY THEY WERE COVERING UP THE NOTE AND THE 
QUESTION TO ASK IS 
WHY DID 
THEY 
IT WHY 
NOT BRING 
IT OUT AND SAY WE 
HAVE DISCOVERED 
THIS NOTE AND THIS 
IS LOOKING VERY BAD INDEED THE 
CONCLUSION THAT MANY PEOPLE LEAP 
TODAY IS THAT THEY COVERED 
UP THAT 
NOTE 
AND CONCEALED 
IT BECAUSE IT 
WAS THE TRUTH 
MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT 
MOHAMED AL FAYED CERTAINLY BELIEVED 
THE WORST AT THE INQUEST HE 
ACCUSED LORD CONDON 
STEVENS OF GIVING IN TO THE DARK 
FORCES BOTH FURIOUSLY DENIED BEING 
PART OF COVER UP LORD STEVENS 
DEMANDED AN APOLOGY HE SAID THEY 
WERE ALWAYS GOING TO DISCLOSE THE 
NOTE WHEN THE TIME WAS RIGHT 
I CAN 
UNDERSTAND WHY THE POLICE WOULD 
WANT TO 
KEEP IT 
SAFELY IT WOULD BE 
A VERY WORRYING DEVELOPMENT FOR 
PRINCES WILLIAM AND HARRY AND 
UNTIL SOME CLEAR EVIDENCE TO 
SUPPORT THE PRINCESS'S FEARS BECAME 
KNOWN THEN THE SAFEST PLACE FOR 
THE NOTE WAS PROBABLY UNDER LOCK 
AND KEY 
AS TIME PASSED THEEIES ABOUT 
DIANA'S DEATH THEORIES ABOUT 
DIANA'S DEATH GREW MORE ELABORATE 
IT WASN'T UNTIL TWO YEARS AFTER THE 
DEATH THAT MOHAMED AL FAYED CAME UP 
WITH ANOTHER CLAIM THAT HE SAID 
GAVE URGENCY TO THE ASSASSINATION 
PLOT 
SHE WAS PREGNANT AND I KNOW PLOT THAT 
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE THAT SHE TOLD ME ON THE PHONE PRINCE PHILIP 
WILL NEVER HAVE ALLOWED MY SON AS 
AN EGYPTIAN NATURALLY TANNED 
WOULD BE THE STEPFATHER OF PRINCE 
WILLIAM AND THE FUTURE KING 
THE WORLD'S PRESS NEEDED NO 
ENCOURAGEMENT TO START THIS 
CONSPIRACY ROLLING THEY SEARCHED 
BACK THROUGH THEIR ARCHIVE AND 
FOUND THIS PICTURE OF DIANA IN SAINT 
TROPEZ A TIGHT SWIMSUIT OR 
EVIDENCE OF PREGNANCY ON THE NIGHT 
SHE DIED THE FRENCH HAD MADE NO 
CHECKS TO SEE IF SHE WAS PREGNANT 
AND HER BODY HAD BEEN EMBALMED THAT 
NIGHT WHICH AL FAYED CLAIMED WAS 
PART OF THE COVER UP 
THE DISCOVERY 
THAT PRINCESS DIANA'S BODY WAS 
EMBALMED IN PARIS WITHIN HOURS OF 
HER DEATH WHAT REASON CAN THERE BE 
OTHER THAN IT WAS PART OF A COVER 
UP TO PREVENT PROPER FORENSIC TESTS 
IN THE U. K. 
BUT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN 
A FAR SIMPLER INVESTIGATION FOR THE 
EMBALMING 
I CAN SEE ONE PRACTICAL EMBALMING REASON FOR DOING IT THAT IS 
BECAUSE SHE WOULD HAVE LANE IN 
STATE NO MORE THAN THAT PRINCESS 
WAS FLOWN BACK TO 
DIANA'S BODY WAS FLOWN BACK TO LONDON THE 
NEXT DAY 
AND TWENTY FOUR 
HOURS 
AFTER THE CRASH A POSTMORTEM WAS 
CARRIED OUT IT SHOWED NO SIGNS OF 
PREGNANCY THE PHOTO WHICH SOME 
SAID SHOWED SHE WAS PREGNANT 
TURNED OUT TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
BEFORE SHE MET DODI THAT SUMMER IN 
COURT THE EVIDENCE POINTED ONE WAY 
SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN 
TEN DAYS BEFORE SHE DIED PRINCESS 
DIANA HAD VISITED THIS CHINESE 
MEDICINE CLINIC IN LONDON HER 
CONSULTANT LILY HUA CONFIRMED 
THAT DIANA WAS TAKING THE 
CONTRACEPTIVE PILL DIANA'S CLOSE 
FRIEND ROSA MONCKTON SAYS HAVING 
SUCH PERSONAL DETAILS CONSTANTLY 
AIRED CAUSES REAL UPSET TO PRINCES 
WILLIAM AND HARRY 
THERE WAS NO 
ELEGANT WAY OF SAYING IT I WISH I 
DIDN'T HAVE TO SHE COULD NOT HAVE 
BEEN PREGNANT 
WHEN 
SHE WAS 
WITH ME 
ON THE BOAT IN GREECE BETWEEN THE 
FIFTEENTH AND TWENTIETH OF AUGUST SHE HAD 
HER PERIOD THERE IS NO WAY SHE 
COULD HAVE BEEN PREGNANT BY THE 
THIRTIETH AUGUST 
BUT THE CONSPIRACY THEORISTS 
REMAINED DEFIANT THE THEORY 
CHANGES SHAPE FINDING ITS WAY 
ROUND EVEN THE MOST AWKWARD 
EVIDENCE FINALLY IT REQUIRES A 
LEAP OF FAITH 
WHAT PEOPLE REALISE 
IS IT DOES NOT MATTER IF DIANA WAS 
PREGNANT OR NOT IT IS WHETHER 
PEOPLE BELIEVED SHE WAS PREGNANT 
THAT MATTERS WHETHER THE 
ESTABLISHMENT IN BRITAIN BELIEVED 
THAT THE PRINCESS THE MOTHER OF 
THE FUTURE KING OF ENGLAND WAS 
ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH TO A HALF 
MUSLIM CHILD 
MOHAMED AL FAYED 
CLAIMED THE RACISM OF THE BRITISH 
ESTABLISHMENT WAS PERSONIFIED BY 
ONE MAN AND HE WOULD HEAD UP THE 
CONSPIRACY YOU FEEL THAT 
WHAT HAPPENED WAS CAUSED BY 
AUTHORISED BY PRINCE PHILIP IP 
DEFINITELY THROUGH THE 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE HE WAS A 
RACIST BOY GROWING UP WITH A NAZI 
YOU THINK HE WOULD ACCEPT MY SON TO 
MARRY PRINCESS DIANA THE MOTHER OF 
THE FUTURE KING 
AL FAYED CLAIMED DIANA HAD TOLD HIM 
ABOUT THREATENING LETTERS THE 
PRINCE HAD SENT HER 
SHE TOLD ME 
SHE HAD LETTERS THREATS SPECIALLY 
FROM PRINCE PHILIP THAT IF SHE 
DOESN'T TOW THE LINE SHE KNOWS 
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO HER 
THESE MISSING LETTERS HAVE BECOME A 
TOUCHSTONE FOR THE CONSPIRACY 
THEORISTS IN PHOTO TWO THOUSAND TWO 
NEWSPAPERS PUBLISHED LURID CLAIMS 
ABOUT THE LETTERS THE PALACE TOOK 
THE RARE STEP OF DENYING THE 
ALLEGATIONS THE PRINCE HAD WRITTEN 
LETTERS TO DIANA BUT THEY WERE NOT 
UNPLEASANT BUT AS LONG AS THE 
COURSE POND DENSE WAS NOT MADE 
PUBLIC CORRESPONDENCE WAS NOT 
MADE PUBLIC THE SPECULATION GREW 
EVENTUALLY AT THE THE PALACE 
RELEASED SOME OF THE LETTERS THEY 
WERE WRITTEN DURING THE BREAK UP 
SHE GREETS HIM AS DEAREST PA HE 
SAYS HE WILL DO HIS JUT MOST FOR 
THE TWO OF THEM DIANA SHOWED HER 
PRIVATE SECRETARY THE LETTERS AT 
THE TIME 
I THOUGHT THE LETTERS 
WERE WELL INTENDED L. THOUGHT 
PERHAPS IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR BOTH 
OF THEM TO CROSS THE GENERATIONAL 
DIVIDE AS EASILY AS THEY MIGHT 
WANT TO BUT I WAS IN NO DOUBT THAT 
HE WAS TRYING TO BE HELPFUL 
THE IDEA THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN 
INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF HIS 
DAUGHTER IN LAW GOES AGAINST 
EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT PRINCE 
PHILIP AND WHAT'S MORE IT DOESN'T 
MAKE ANY LOGICAL SENSE TO ME EITHER 
THE CORONER DECIDED THAT NEITHER 
THE QUEEN NOR PRINCE PHILIP WOULD 
BE REQUIRED TO GIVE EVIDENCE TO THE 
INQUEST IT WOULD NOT BE EXPEDIENT 
HE SAID 
AT THE INQUEST THE MAGNITUDE OF 
MOHAMED AL FAYED'S CLAIMS FOR THE 
CONSPIRACY BECAME CLEAR IN HIS 
EYES PRINCE PHILIP AND PRINCE 
CHARLES WERE BOTH INVOLVED SO WAS 
TONY BLAIR SO WERE LORD STEVENS 
LORD FELLOWES THE QUEEN'S PRIVATE 
SECRETARY LORD JAY THE AMBASSADOR 
TO PARIS EVEN DIANA'S IS SISTER 
LADY SARAH MCCORQUODALE WAS 
INVOLVED IN THE COVER UP THERE WAS 
SPIES IN THE FRENCH POLICE MEDICAL 
SERVICE AND AMONG THE FORENSIC 
SCIENTISTS THERE WERE SPIES IN THE 
COURTS AND THE BRITISH POLICE HE 
EVEN SAW SUPPLIES AMONG THOSE 
REPORTING THE INCIDENT THE THE EVIDENCE WHAT EVIDENCE I'M NOT 
TALKING TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE 
BLOODY IDIOT YOU ARE PART OF THE 
ESTABLISHMENT AND YOU ARE A 
JOURNALIST YOU WORK FOR M. I SIX YOU 
IDIOT IDIOT IN THE END THE JURY JUST DIDN'T 
BELIEVE HIS CLAIMS THEY HAD LADDER 
EVIDENCE THAT ONE OF HIS TEAM HAD 
LIED TO SPREAD HIS STORY ALONG 
WITH ACCUSATIONS THAT OTHERS MAY 
HAVE DONE SO TOO AND SOME OF HIS 
FORMER EMPLOYEES ALSO TOLD THE JURY 
OF THE PRESSURE THEY WERE PUT UNDER 
TO BACK UP THEIR BOSS'S VERSION OF 
EVENTS 
MR. AL FAYED'S ATTITUDE EVENTS CHANGED AFTER THE ACCIDENT HE 
WANTED ABSOLUTELY TO KNOW WHAT 
HAPPENED BUT HE WANTED TO HEAR 
WHAT HE WANTED TO HEAR 
HE WAS FROM THE BEGINNING 
PERSUADED ABOUT AN ASSASSINATION 
AND HE NEVER BELIEVED IN ALL THE 
OTHER VERSIONS WHICH WERE GIVEN BY 
THE POLICE OR WHICH WERE GIVEN BY 
THE JUDGE 
IN HIS SUMMING UP THE CORONER SAID 
THAT THE CONSPIRACY THEEIES 
ADVANCED BY AL FAYED THEORIES 
ADVANCED BY MOHAMED AL FAYED 
HADN'T A SHRED OF EVIDENCE TO 
SUPPORT THEM HE SAID SOME OF HIS 
ALLEGATIONS WERE FANCIFUL AND EVEN 
HIS OWN LAWYERS WERE NO LONGER 
PURSUING IT THE JURY'S VERDICT IS 
THE COUPLE WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED 
THAT THE PAPARAZZI WERE DRIVING IN 
A GROSSLY NEGLIGENT WAY THAT HENRI 
PAUL WAS DRIVING TOO FAST AND UNDER 
THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL IT HAS 
TAKEN TEN YEARS AND COST BRITISH 
TAX PAYERS MORE THAN SIX MILLION 
I THINK BEFORE WE WRITE IT ALL OVER 
AS A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME AND 
MONEY WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT THE 
PRINCESS WAS TO BE OUR FUTURE QUEEN 
THE FACT SHE DIED IN AN UNEXPECTED 
AND POSSIBLY SINISTER CIRCUMSTANCES 
OUGHT TO BE INVESTIGATED AND THE 
PRICE IN TIME AND MONEY SHOULD BE 
PAID 
I DO FEEL THAT DIANA HAS BEEN PAID BADLY LET DOWN IN A SENSE THAT FAR 
MORE HAS COME OUT IN REAL TIME IN 
THE INQUEST ABOUT HER PRIVATE LIFE 
SO MANY INTMACIES ABOUT HER 
FRIENDSHIPS WITH PEOPLE THAT NO 
RED TOP NEWSPAPERS OR ANY OF THE 
REST OF US BROUGHT OUT IN THE 
PRECEDING TEN YEARS I THINK THAT 
IS A GREAT SHAME CROSS EXAMINATION CROSS EXAMINATION AT THE INQUEST HAS BEEN RIGOROUS 
REPUTATIONS HAVE BEEN ON THE LINE 
FOR ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF ANY 
INQUEST THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR IS 
TO PUT AN END TO RUMOUR AND 
SPECULATION SPECULATION BUT THAT MAY NOT BE IN THE NATURE 
OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES 
WHEN YOU 
PRESENT SOLID AND CREDIBLE EVIDENCE 
TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS EMBRACED A 
CONSPIRACY THEORY IT IS EXTREMELY 
DIFFICULT TO HAVE THEM GIVE UP ON 
THEIR BELIEF IN THEIR CONSPIRACY 
THEY WILL CLAIM THE EVIDENCE YOU 
HAVE PRESENTED HAS BEEN TAINTED 
PLANTED BY THE CONSPIRATORS 
THEMSELVES IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE 
TO GET SOMEBODY TO CHANGE THEIR 
MIND MIND BUT DIANA'S FRIENDS DESPERATELY 
HOPE THAT THE THEORIES ABOUT HER 
DEATH WILL NOT 
BE THE 
DEFINING 
FEATURE OF HER LIFE 
FOR THE PRINCES PARTICULARLY IT 
HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM L. 
THINK THEY FIND IT THE PUBLIC 
OWNERSHIP OF THEIR MOTHER A VERY 
DIFFICULT THING L. HOPE VERY MUCH 
THIS INQUIRY WILL NOW PUT 
EVERYTHING LIKE THAT TO REST ALL 
THE RUMOURS THE GOSSIP AND THAT 
YOU KNOW HER BOYS PARTICULARLY 
WILL BE ALLOWED TO CARRY THEIR OWN 
MEMORIES OF THEIR MOTHER AS SHE WAS 
NOT AS HOW 
OTHER PEOPLE 
WOULD LIKE 
TO THINK SHE WAS
