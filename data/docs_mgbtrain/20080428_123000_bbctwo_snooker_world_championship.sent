GOOD AFTERNOON BEING IN SHEFFIELD 
IN THE SECOND WEEK OF THIS WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP IS AN ACHIEVEMENT IN 
ITSELF BUT FOR SOME PLAYERS IT IS 
NOT ALL ABOUT JUST TRYING TO WIN 
THE WORLD TITLE OH NO WHAT 
HAPPENED THIS WEEK WILL DIRECTLY 
AFFECT WHERE THEY GO AND WHAT THEY 
DO NEXT SEASON IT IS ALL A 
QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU ARE IN OR 
OUT I AM TALKING ABOUT BEING A 
MEMBER OF THE PRESTIGIOUS TOP SIXTEEN 
PLAYERS CLUB 
THE TOP SIXTEEN WAS ALWAYS A FOR MANY 
YEARS A HARD CORE STATUS QUO WHO 
COULD VIRTUALLY GUARANTEED TWELVE THIRTEEN 
PLAYERS WHO WOULD BE THERE NOT SO 
ANY MORE RELEGATION AND PROMOTION 
ISSUES HAVE BECOME A LOT MORE CLYWD 
A FLUID WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO 
WILL BE IN THE BOTTOM END OF THE 
TOP SIXTEEN THAT IS STILL UP FOR GRABS 
MARK ALLEN WAS SWEATING LAST WEEK 
I THINK I JUST COST MYSELF A TOP SIXTEEN 
PLACE WHICH IS THE MOST 
DISAPPOINTING THING I DON'T REALLY 
KNOW WHAT TO DO I'M JUST REALLY 
DISAPPOINTED 
MARK SELBY THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN 
COMES FORWARD TO CONGRATULATE MARK 
KING LOOK WHAT IT MEANS TO HIM IF IF I GET INTO THE SIXTEEN BRILLIANT IF 
NOT SO WHAT L. WANT TO ENJOY MY 
SNOOKER IF I GET IN I GET IN IF 
NOT I WILL BE BACK AT PRESTATYN 
WHAT A MATCH STEVE DAVIS HAS GIVEN 
ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT 
I PLAYED BETTER THAN THE TOP 
SIXTEEN SO THAT IS QUITE A FEW OF THEM 
DROPPED OUT THIS YEAR THAT IS 
WHY 
STEVE DAVIS HAS GIVEN AS YOU WHY WOULD EXPECT HIS ALL IN WHAT 
TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY GOOD MATCH 
I SHALL GO OUT AND PLAYING THE 
QUALIFIERS AGAINST SOME DECENT 
PLAYERS STILL DEAD GOOD PLAYERS 
AND PIT MY WITS AND TRY AND GET 
BACK TO THE T. V. STAGES HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY I'LL GET IN THE SIXTEEN THIS YEAR IF 
NOT IT WILL BE WEIRD TURNING UP AT 
A QUALIFYING AND SEEING KEN 
STEPHEN LEE STEVE DAVIS 
HE KNOWS 
IF HE LOSES THIS HE WILL HAVE TO 
QUALIFY TO GET TO SHEFFIELD NEXT 
SEASON 
LIANG WENBO BEAT KEN SEASON DOHERTY 
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT DOHERTY HAPPENED AND WHERE IT AS ALL GONE 
WRONG A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I WAS 
AT THE TOP OF THE RANKINGS NOW I 
AM OUT OF THE SIXTEEN 
SOMEBODY UP THERE 
HELP ME 
STEPHEN LEE DID NOT PERFORM AT ALL 
JOE SWAIL WILL BE DELIGHTED 
A THAT 
IS EXACTLY WHAT I DESERVE FROM THE 
WAY I HAVE PLAYED TO BE OUT OF THE 
TOP SIXTEEN L. HAVE HAD ENOUGH 
BUT THIS 
TIME IN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP A 
SLIDE RULE AT A CALCULATOR ARE 
USEFUL BECAUSE WORKING OUT WHO IS 
IN AND OUT OF THE TOP SIXTEEN CAN BE 
QUITE TOUGH JOE PERRY IS STAKE MARCO FU WOULD 
NEED AN EXTRAORDINARY SERIES OF 
RESULTS TO GO AGAINST HIM TO BE 
DENIED A PLACE MARK KING AND MARCO 
AL ANBAR SWEATING MARK ALLEN 
HE THERE ARE A LOT OF IFS AND BUTS 
A IT IS A FUNNY TIME OF YEAR 
IT IS 
VERY FUNNY BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY 
TIME WHEN CERTAIN PLAYERS WISH ILL 
OF OTHERS MARK ALLEN AND MARK KING 
ARE HOPING THAT EVERYTHING GOES 
RIGHT FOR THEM AND WRONG FOR THE 
PEOPLE STILL INVOLVED LAST YEAR 
RYAN DAY TO GET INTO THE SIXTEEN HE HE HAD A FUNNY EPISODE HE WAS RELYING 
ON A QUARTER FINAL BETWEEN MATTHEW 
STEVENS AND SHAUN MURPHY IF SHAUN 
MURPHY GOES THROUGH HE IS SAFE 
BUT MATTHEW STEVENS WAS TWELVE TO SEVEN AHEAD 
ALL OF SUDDEN HE GETS A PHONE 
CALL IT IS TWELVE TO TWELVE HE SEES HIS BEST 
MATE BACK IN WALES HIS PRACTICE 
PARTNER MATTHEW STEVENS LOSE THE 
LAST FRAME WHICH MEANS RYAN DAY IS 
IN A PHONE CALL WAS UNLUCKY 
MATTHEW TOUGH CALL BUT THAT IS 
THE WAY IT IS IT MAKES A BIG 
DIFFERENCE TO WAIT YOU ARE IN THE 
GAME YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY THE 
QUALIFYING ROUNDS WHERE YOU ARE 
YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET THROUGH TO 
THE MASTERS YOU ARE STRAIGHT 
THROUGH TO THE CRUCIBLE 
IT WILL BE 
AN INTERESTING DAY AND INDEED THE 
REMAINDER OF THE CHAMPIONSHIPS A 
LOT COULD BE RESOLVED OVER THE 
COMING FEW HOURS THIS IS WHAT WILL 
BE RESOLVED THIS AFTERNOON AFTER A 
SIX YEAR CRUCIBLE ABSENCE STUART 
BINGHAM IS MAKING THE MOST OF THIS 
CAMPAIGN HE IS FIVE TO THREE IN FRONT OF JOE 
PERRY SECOND SESSION TO COME I I WILL BE COMMENTATING ON THE JOE 
SWAIL LIANG WENBO MATCH SURPRISING 
THAT THE YOUNG MAN FROM CHINA HAS A 
SIX TO TWO LEAD JOE SWAIL HAS IT ALL TO 
DO A VERY INTERESTING

AFTERNOON'S MAIN FEATURE TWO GREAT 
CHAMPIONS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AND 
MARK WILLIAMS DOWN TO THE WIRE IN

FOR REPAIRS 
GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR OPINIONS AND 
QUESTIONS 
IT HAS BEEN A DISAPPOINTING SEASON 
FOR CAMBRIDGESHIRE CUE MAN JOE 
PERRY IN ONE RESPECT WHICH IS 
THAT HIS TEAM ARSENAL HAVE RATHER 
SLIPPED UP JOE HIMSELF IS GOING 
GREAT GUNS JOE PERRY IS DEFINITELY 
BACK IN THE TOP SIXTEEN FOR THE THIRD 
TIME HE HAS A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF 
MAKING IT TO HIS SECOND EVER 
CRUCIBLE QUARTER FINAL HE IS 
PLAYING STUART BINGHAM 
YOU DON'T WANT TO TURN UP GET 
BEATEN GO HOME BEFORE THE 
TOURNAMENT IS IN FULL SWING WE ARE 
APPROACHING THE SECOND WEEK TO 
STILL BE INVOLVED IS WHAT EVERYBODY 
WANTS TO DO L. 
AM STILL IN IT SO I AM HAPPY AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE GAME 
IT IS DEFINITELY THE BEST I'VE 
PLAYED AT THE CRUCIBLE FOR QUITE A 
LONG TIME L. L. HAVE SUFFERED A COUPLE 
OF HEAVY FIRST ROUND DEFEATS IN THE 
PAST FEW YEARS TO GET THAT WENT 
OUT OF THE WAY AND PLAY AS GOOD AS 
I DID WAS GREAT HAVE HAD A FEW 
UPS AND DOWNS AT THE CRUCIBLE YOU 
PLAY EVERY SESSION LIKE IT IS THE 
LAST STOP YOU TRY AND WIN EVERY 
SESSION I STILL DON'T THINK THE 
MATCH IS LONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO 
AFFORD TO HAVE A GOOD START A BAD 
SESSION BUT DROPPING TWO OR THREE 
FRAMES BEHIND IS NOT THE END OF THE 
WORLD THE WAY THE GAME IS YOU 
CAN'T AFFORD ONE BAD SESSION THE 
PRESSURE IS ON FROM THE WORD GO WE 
ARE BOTH UP FOR THE BATTLE WE ARE 
READY FOR WHAT PIPPY FOR WHAT 
PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO THROW AT US 
IT IS NOT NICE WHEN PEOPLE COME 
BACK AT YOU TO COME THROUGH WITH A 
VICTORY IS ALWAYS PLEASING TO KNOW 
YOU CAN STILL HOLD IT TOGETHER WHEN 
THE PRESSURE GET BIG WE BOTH KNOW 
WE HAVE THAT PART OF POWER GAME IN 
GOOD ORDER HOPE THE REST FLICKS 
INTO PLACE TO STOP THAT POT OF 
POWER GAME WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
THAT THESE PLAYERS BOARD HAVE GOT 
THEIR NAMES ON THE TROPHY THEY 
HAVE ALL PROVED IT GOOD ENOUGH IT 
IS THERE FOR EVERYONE IF YOU CAN 
FIND YOUR BEST FORM AND HAVE BIT 
OF LUCK MAYBE WE CAN ALL FULFIL 
OUR DREAMS 
IT WAS A TENSE AFFAIR ON TABLE TWO 
YESTERDAY BETWEEN JOE PERRY AND 
STUART BINGHAM WITH SO MUCH AT 
STAKE THERE WERE BOUND TO BE MRS. 
APLENTY IN FRAME ONE JOE WAS 
GUILTY OF THE FEW MORE THAN STUART 
WHO EVENTUALLY WON IT ON THE PINK 
FRAME TWO SAFELY IN THE BACK MACRO 
PERRY TOOK OUT SOME OF HIS STRESS 
ON THE BLACK BALL IN THE BAG 
BINGHAM WAS ADOPTING A MORE SOFTLY 
SOFTLY APPROACH WHICH PAID 
DIVIDENDS IN THE FORM OF A COUPLE 
OF FORTY BREAKS IN THE FOURTH FRAME 
POSITIONAL SHOT OFF THE FIRST FOUR 
FRAMES OF THIS RED FROM THE MAN 
FROM CAMBRIDGE TWO TO TWO AT THE INTERVAL 
IN FRAME FIVE THE BASILDON BOY 
FOUND A BIT OF LINDSAY AS HE 
STROKED IN A BREAK OF NINETY EIGHT A BIT 
OF FLU AND SEE IN THE NEXT JOE 
WENT OFF THE RAILS BREAKING DOWN 
TO HAND THE INITIATIVE TO STUART 
BINGHAM FRAME SEVEN WAS A MIRROR 
PERFORMANCE JOE MISSING A RED ON A 
BREAK OF FIFTY AND STUART CLEARING UP 
BUT AFTER A PROTRACTED SAFETY 
BATTLE JOE FINALLY MADE THE FRAME 
WINNING BREAK TO TAKE THE LAST OF 
THE SESSION NEITHER PLAYER WILL BE 
PARTICULARLY HAPPY WITH THEIR FORM 
BUT FIVE TO THREE IS A REASONABLY FAIR 
REFLECTION WELL STUART AND JOE 
RETURNED TO THE ARENA AT TEN A M. AT 
THE START OF A VERY LONG DAY PERRY 
HAD CLEARLY HAD HIS PORRIDGE 
BECAUSE HE TOOK THE OPENING COUPLE 
OF FRAMES THEY ARE BACK ON LEVEL 
TERMS AT THE JOIN THEM IN FRAME ELEVEN 
PERRY TO PLAY AHEAD BY FORTY FIVE TO TWENTY TWO NEAL 
FOULDS AND TERRY GRIFFITHS ARE IN 
THE BOX 
NOW THIS IS JUST SHORT OF SPEED 
YOU COULD SEE STUART WAS STARING 
DOWN ON THE SHOT ALMOST WILLING 
THE CUE BALL ON 
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF THE 
REGAL BEFORE THEY GO IN IF THEY 
EIGHT REGAL 
IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM 
THAT RED NEXT TO THE BLACK IT HAS 
BEEN THERE FOR WHILE HE IS NOT GREAT HERE HE NEEDED A GOOD SHOT 
THAT IS AS GOOD AS HE COULD HAVE 
DONE NOW THEN HOW IS HE GOING TO 
GET THIS LAST RED OFF THE CUSHION WELL HE MAY JUST PLAY FOR IT 
HE THOUGHT HE HAD THE ANGLE TO 
NUDGE INTO THE RED HE DID GET VERY 
CLOSE IF HE HAD CAUGHT THAT 
QUARTER HALF BALL HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN PERFECT 
HE FOLLOWED UP WITH A PRETTY DECENT 
SAFETY SHOT BUT THERE MIGHT BE A 
BIT OF IT STICKING OUT FOR JOE TO 
JUST CLIP ON HE IS BACK IN THE 
FRAME STUART 
THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE GOING IN 
THERE THAT HAS GIVEN STUART THE 
CHANCE TO PUT THE CUE BALL WHERE HE 
WANTS L. JUST FEEL THIS IS TURNING 
INTO QUITE A SIGNIFICANT FRAME 
POSSIBLY IN THE MATCH IN THAT IT 
IS ANOTHER FRAME THAT JOE COULD 
HAVE WON AND HE HASN'T ACTUALLY 
LEAD IN THE MATCH YET BE IT 
CERTAINLY APPEARED HE WAS TAKING 
THE LEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME 
WOW BY CATCHING THAT BUMP HE HAS 
MADE THIS RED LITTLE BIT THINNER 
IF HE HADN'T CAUGHT AT THE BUMP HE 
MAY WELL HAVE SNOOKERED JOE PERRY 
ON THIS RED 
THAT IS THE FIRST BALL JOE PERRY 
HAS POTTED FOR OVER ELEVEN MINUTES 
SINCE HE MADE FORTY FIVE EARLIER ON IN THIS 
FRAME 
NOW HE HAS A GREAT CHANCE A VERY 
IMPORTANT FRAME NOT JUST BECAUSE 
OF THE SCORE LINE BUT BECAUSE OF 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH IN THIS 
FRAME PERFECT ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
STUART KNOWS HE HAS LOST THE FRAME 
BARRING SOME KIND OF A MIRACLE SO 
IT WAS A FRAME THAT COULD HAVE GONE 
EITHER WAY 
JOE PERRY FOR THE FIRST TIME GOES 
INTO THE LEAD 
THAT IS THREE IN A ROW FOR JOE 
PERRY HE IS REALLY INTO HIS STRIDE 
AND SHOWING A BIT OF THE GRIT WHICH 
TOOK HIM PAST FORMER FORMER 
CHAMPION GRAEME DOTT IN THE OPENING 
ROUND INTO THE NEXT AND PERRY IS 
THIRTY TWO BEHIND 
JOE GOT UP IMMEDIATELY ON THAT SHOT 
HE KNEW HE DIDN'T HIT IT HARD 
ENOUGH THAT IS UNFORGIVABLE 
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING HE COULDN'T 
DO IS STOP SHORT IF HE CAN SEE 
THIS RED IN THE MIDDLE IT IS STILL 
A VERY THIN CUT 
HE NEEDED A BIT OF LUCK BUT DIDN'T 
GET IT 
THESE PINK'S INTO THE FAR RIGHT 
CORNER ARE FINE WHEN YOU ARE OUT 
THERE AND PLAYING REALLY GOOD AND 
HAD PLENTY OF TABLE TIME BUT THAT 
IS NOT THE CASE FOR STUART BINGHAM 
IT MAY BE TIME TO RUN FOR COVER IF 
HE CAN GET A GOOD BRIDGE HAND AND 
TAKE THE PINK ON HE IS NOT HE 
IS BRIDGING OVER WELL HE TOOK IT ON 
NOW HE HAS A CHANCE THE PINK GOES 
BACK ON TO THE BLACK SPOT 
ONCE AGAIN HIS CUE BALL HAS STUCK 
ON THE REDS A LITTLE THE TROUBLE 
HERE WAS HE WAS TRYING TO GO INTO 
THEM AND AVOID THE BLACK IN 
AVOIDING THE BLACK HE HAS KIND OF 
TAKING AWAY THE CHANCE TO GET THE 
SIDE OF THE REDS AND SPLIT THEM UP 
HE WAS GOING INTO THE CENTRE OF THE 
REDS TO TRY TO GET AWAY FROM THE 
BLACK AND THAT IS NOT ALWAYS WHEN 
THEY BREAK WELL 
HIS DISAPPOINTMENT WILL BE EVIDENT 
BUT I THINK THIS HAS TURNED INTO A 
FRAME THAT HE HAS TO WIN ONE WAY 
OR ANOTHER IF HE CAN'T MAKE A SIXTY 
OR SEVENTY BREAK WHICH IS UNLIKELY HE 
HAS TO GET OVER THE LINE IT MAY 
NOT BE THE PRETTY BUT HE HAS TO 
WIN THIS HAVING LOST FOUR FRAMES 
IN A ROW I WONDER IF THERE IS A PLANT ON 
JOE SEEMED TO THINK IT WAS ON BUT 
IT WAS MISSED BY SOME MARGIN L. CAN 
SEE WHY HE WAS INTERESTED IN THAT 
WILL STOP IT LINED UP HE HIT IT 
WRONG INTERESTED IN THAT HE HE CAUGHT IT TOO THIN HE THOUGHT HE 
COULD POP PLANT IN THE MIDDLE STAY 
ON THE BLACK AND NOT LEAVE ANYTHING 
ON A 
IF YOU DON'T WIN ANY FRAME IN THIS 
SESSION A FIFTEEN MINUTE BREAK ISN'T 
GREAT 
IT ALL LOOKS EASY NOW DOESN'T IT IT WILL NOT BE LOOKING THAT WAY TO 
STUART BINGHAM UNTIL HE GETS THE 
BALLS IN THE POCKETS TO DEFINITELY 
WIN THE FRAME HE CAN'T RELAX OUT 
THERE 
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE TO 
CARRY ON THIS BREAK IT LOOKS AS IF 
IT IS GOING TO BE THREE TO ONE JOE PERRY IN 
THIS SESSION 
VITAL FOR STUART BINGHAM TO WIN 
THIS LAST FRAME A GOOD POT THAT 
THAT WAS IMPORTANT IN THE CONTEXT 
OF THE FRAME BUT IT WOULDN'T DO 
HIM ANY HARM TO POT A FEW MORE 
BALLS 
JOE PERRY WILL BE HAPPY ENOUGH I 
SUPPOSE THAT THINGS ARE LEVEL HE 
WAS FIVE TO THREE BEHIND STARTING THIS 
SESSION BUT THEY ARE NEVER HAPPY 
THESE PLAYERS 
JOE PERRY HAD HALF A CHANCE TO WIN 
THIS FRAME BEFORE THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL 
ON THE OTHER HAND HE COULD HAVE 
LOST A FEW OF THE PREVIOUS FRAMES 
I THINK THREE TO ONE IS A FAIR RESULT 
THE DOUBLE DOESN'T GO IN BUT 
STUART BINGHAM WILL BE HAPPY TO 
TAKE HIS FIRST FRAME OF THE MORNING 
I AM SURE HE IS VERY RELIEVED I 
MET STUART THIS MORNING AND HE TOLD 
ME HE ONLY SLEPT FOUR HOURS LAST 
NIGHT HIS MIND KEPT WAKING HIM UP 
AND GOING THROUGH SHOTS HE LOOKED 
FULLY AWAKE NOW THIS IS FRAME THIRTEEN 
HE LOOKS PERFECT 
WE SHOULD SEE A FEW POINTS GO IN 
HERE THE REDS ARE VERY WELL SET 
STUART HAS HAD HIS FIFTEEN MINUTES TO 
TALK OVER HIS FIRST SESSION 
WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF STUART BINGHAM 
OVER THE YEARS HE IS VERY MUCH AND 
IN AND OUT PLAYER 
WHEN HE GETS GOING HE SCORES AND 
KNOCKS ALL THE LONG BALLS IN 
YES HE IS KIND OF A HAPPY SCORER 
HE LOVES TO BE IN AMONGST THEM AND 
SCORING HEAVILY 
HE HAS MADE TWO COMPETITIVE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
BREAKS TO MAKE ONE IS SOMETHING 
MAYBE THE SCRAPPY OF FRAMES HE 
DOESN'T ALWAYS WIN SCRAPPY A 
WE MENTIONED EARLIER HE COULD BREAK 
INTO THE TOP SIXTEEN AFTER THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP IF HE DOES WELL HERE 
THAT WOULD BE HIS FIRST TIME 
HE HAS BEEN PROFESSIONAL SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
SO HE HAS SERVED HIS APPRENTICESHIP 
NICELY PLAYED AGAIN HE DOESN'T 
ALWAYS GO INTO THEM AT SPEED HE 
CAN VISUALISE WHAT IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN JUDGED IT NICELY 
A LITTLE BIT OF AN ANGLE ON THIS 
SHOT SLIGHTLY DISTURBED BY SOME 
PEOPLE LEAVING THE CRUCIBLE THAT 
IS A GOOD SHOT IT VERY WELL JUDGED 
VERY WELL 
GOOD SHOT THAT WAS EXCELLENT 
SUPERBLY JUDGED HE MADE A 
DIFFICULT SHOT LOOK EASY THERE HE 
HAS GIVEN HIMSELF A CHOICE OF TWO 
REDS ONE TO THE RIGHT CENTRE THAT 
IS THE ONE I THINK HE WILL TAKE 
IT IS ALL BLACKS SO FAR THE REDS 
ARE WELL SET IN A PACK CLOSE TO THE 
SINK PINK A LOT TO DO BEFORE WE 
CAN THINK OF A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN ALWAYS HANDY 
WHEN THE REDS ARE ALL CLOSE 
TOGETHER OFF A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN OF HER 
THAT IS PERFECT ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
THREE REDS INTO PLAY STILL GOT 
THOSE PACK OF THREE BEHIND THE PINK 
AND THE ONE TIED ON THE LEFT 
CUSHION 
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO PLAY CUSHION ANYTHING DIFFICULT TO STAY ON THE 
BACK SOMETIMES YOU SEE A PLAYER 
PLAYING ON THE BLACK AT THIS STAGE 
BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE GREAT YEARS ON 
BUT IT IS NOT ALWAYS THE SHOT HE 
KNOWS THE BREAK 
HE IS ON L. THINK HE HAS FINISHED AT THE WRONG ANGLE 
ON THE BLACK JUDGING BY HIS 
POSITION HERE THAT IS ONE OF THE 
WORST TANGLES YOU CAN HAVE HER HE 
WOULD RATHER BE STRAIGHTER THAN 
THAT ANGLE YOU NEED TO BE GOING TO 
THE BLACK RUSSIAN TO CONTINUE THE 
BREAK THE BLACK A CUSHION 
HE DID WELL TO GET THAT ANGLE 
TERRY BUT HE MAY BE A BIT UNLUCKY 
HE HAD TO PLAY FOR THE ONE IN THE 
MIDDLE REALLY HE COULD HAVE DONE 
THAT AS IT TURNED OUT HE MAY BE 
FORCED TO TAKE THE DIFFICULT RED 
AND IF HE GETS IT THAT IS THE ONE 
OUT OF THE WAY THAT IS ON THE 
CUSHIONS 
IF HE TAKES THIS RED CUSHIONS ALONG THE CUSHION IT IS BECAUSE HE 
IS THINKING OF A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
AT VERY GOOD SHOT THIS TIME HE 
MAY NUDGE INTO THE THREE REDS BELOW 
THE PINK A VERY GOOD SHOT 
NOT A NATURAL TO GET ON TO THE 
BLACK BUT STILL A WAY OF DOING IT 
IF HE WANTS TO IF THIS NEXT RED 
GOES IN THE FRAME IS EFFECTIVELY 
SAFE HE COULD PLAY ON THE BLACK I I THINK HE HAS HAD A GLANCE ABOUT 
TAKING IT THROUGH THE BAULK COLOURS 
AND BACK AROUND AGAIN THE RED IS 
VERY THIN NOT AN EASY PATH TO THE 
STAGE AN EASY POT AT THIS STAGE 
IT COULD ATTEND IT NEVER LOOKED AS 
IF HE HIT BACK HARD ENOUGH 
HE DID 
NOT LOOK AT THE RED YOU SAID L. 
THOUGHT THERE WAS A RED IN THE TOP 
RIGHT POCKET WHICH WOULD HAVE GIVEN 
HIM A CLEAR SHOT ON TO THE BLACK A A PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO SCREW 
BACK INTO ANOTHER RED PERHAPS 
THE CHANCES GONE ANYWAY THE 
CHANCE IS GONE 
THE GOOD EFFORT EIGHT COULD AVERT 
A GOOD EFFORT 
THAT ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN CHANCE CERTAINLY WILL NOT 
HAUNT STEWARD AS BADLY AS THE ONE 
IN TWO THOUSAND TWO STUART BINGHAM HE 
MISSED FINAL PINK AND WITH IT 
THE CHANCE OF WINNING ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
THAT STAYED WITH HIM FOR A LONG 
TIME BELIEVE YOU ME HE HAS A LOT 
ON HIS MIND IN THIS FRAME STUART 
BINGHAM WITH IT ALL TO DO HERE 
STUART BINGHAM WITH A SLIGHT 
PROBLEM OF THE FACT THAT THE REDS 
ARE ALL LINED UP FOR THE RIGHT 
CORNER ON THE PINK THE OPTIONS 
ARE LIMITED THE FACT IT WENT 
STRAIGHT THIS TIME AS GIVING HIM A 
SHOT AT LEAST HAS GIVEN HIM 
HE DIDN'T PLAY THAT WITH TOO MUCH 
PACE YOU WILL NOTICE HE'S TRYING 
TO KEEP ONE OF THE REDS ON THE SIDE 
CUSHION AND IT WORKED OUT GOOD 
THIS MATTER HAS BEEN VERY STRANGE 
IN ONE RESPECT IN THAT THERE HAS 
BEEN A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THE 
FRAMES PLAYED WHEN THE ONE THAT 
GETS IN DOESN'T CLINCH THE FRAME 
AND THE OTHER HAS A CHANCE THIS 
MATCH HAS BEEN STRANGE 
THERE HAVE 
BEEN LOTS OF BREAKS OF FORTY AND FIFTY 
BUT THEY ARE NOT FRAME DENTURES IT 
HAS BEEN INTERESTING TO WATCH THIS 
MATCH THEY HAVE NOT CLINCHED THE 
FRAME THEY ARE BOTH GENERALLY IN 
GOOD FORM BUT THERE HAVE BEEN 
MISTAKES MADE 
WELL HE ASKED A LOT THERE AT 
FIRST I THOUGHT HE WOULD ROLL THE 
BLUE IN L. AM NOT SURE IF HE COULD 
HAVE COME AROUND ON THIS L. THOUGHT 
HE WOULD ROLL THIS IN AND PLOUGH 
THE RED ON THE LEFT BUT EVEN 
COMING AROUND I AM NOT SURE WHAT 
HE WAS PLAYING ON 
HE WAS HOPING TO 
SWING AROUND AND GET AT VERY 
EASY PART MR. BECAUSE OF PUSHING 
THE BOAT OUT A BIT A VERY EASY 
POT WHICH WAS MISSED 
FOUL 
YOU DO NOT OFTEN GET ANOTHER CHANCE 
IN THESE FRAMES AFTER MISSING AN 
EASY BALL LIKE JOE PERRY PLAYED HE 
MISSED A PINK ON HIS PREVIOUS VISIT 
HE MAY NOT PAY FOR IT ON THIS SHOT 
BECAUSE THE REDS ARE PRETTY SAFE 
THE LAST TWO OR THREE SHOTS BOTH 
PLAYERS HAD BEEN PRETTY UGLY HE 
HAS MOVED EVERYTHING THEY'RE TRYING 
TO POT THAT READ HE HAS NEW DO 
EVERYTHING TRYING TO POT AT FRED 
OGELY MOVED EVERYTHING TRYING 
TO PART THAT RED POT 
YOU GET TO 
THIS CRUCIAL STAGE THERE ARE SO 
MANY SESSIONS BUT STEVE BINGHAM 
KNOWS STUART BINGHAM KNOWS IF HE 
WINS THIS HE CANNOT BE THE HEINZ 
HE CANNOT BE BEHIND GOING INTO 
TONIGHT'S SESSION 
THE TABLE IS A LITTLE BIT MESSY 
BUT JOE PERRY HAD A GOOD ANGLE ON 
THIS PINK AND HE COULD HAVE GONE ON 
THAT FRED OGELY MOST OF THE 
COLOURS ARE AVAILABLE BUT THEY ARE 
NOT ON THEIR SPOTS ON THAT RED 
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT IT REALLY 
WISE QUITE DIFFICULT ALONG THE 
CUSHION IT REALLY WANTS TWICE 
HE FELT IT WAS WORTH TAKING THE 
RISK IT LOOKS AS IF IT WOULD WIN 
IN THE FRAME WHEN HIM JAY 
SNOOKER IS NEEDED BUT THE GREEN 
SHOULD JUST ABOUT SECURE THE FRAME 
THAT RAID THAT JOE PERRY POTTED I 
THINK IT IS THE RIGHT TYPE TO PLAY 
RED 
JOE PERRY HAS LEVELLED THINGS UP 
AGAIN AGAIN THIS IS DOG EARED OLD CONTEST INTO THE PENULTIMATE FRAME 
YOU CANNOT LEGISLATE FOR THIS HE 
PLAYED A GOOD POT IT IS ACTUALLY 
TO BE VERY NICE ESPECIALLY THE 
FACT THERE IS A RED CLOSE TO THE 
POCKET IT IS NOT GOING TO BE 
VERY NICE THIS IS NOT A NICE 
LOOKING TABLE FOR JOE PERRY GIVEN 
THE FACT HE HAS TO PLAY NEXT NOT 
A RED HE HAS TO PLAY COLOUR NEXT 
HIS ONLY CHOICE HERE IS TO NEXT TRY AND LEAVE SOME DISTANCE BETWEEN 
THE CUE BALL AND THE REDS L. CANNOT 
SEE ANY WHERE HE CAN GET SAFE HERE 
IF HE CAN GET OF TWO CUSHIONS TO 
THE BLUE AND DROP ON THAT IT WOULD 
NOT BE BAD BECAUSE THE ANGLE HE 
WOULD LEAVE FOR THE RED WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT FOR STEVE BINGHAM 
STUART BINGHAM FOUL AND A MISS 
HE HAS LEFT SOME DISTANCE BETWEEN 
THE WHITE AND THE RED 
I DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO MISS THAT 
RED A BIT UNLUCKY THIS TIME FOR 
STUART BINGHAM THE RED HAS COME 
BACK OVER TO THE MIDDLE 
I SHOULD THINK JOE WOULD BE 
DELIGHTED WITH THE LAST TWO WERE 
THREE SHOTS HE WILL BE VERY 
GRATEFUL THAT STUART BINGHAM MISS 
THE OPENING RED MIST STUART 
BINGHAM MISSED THE OPENING RED 
HE WAS IN THE PERFECT POSITION HE 
NEEDS TO RETAIN GOOD POSITION THE 
BLUE IS OFF ITS SPOT SO THAT IS 
NOT AVAILABLE PINK IS NOT 
AVAILABLE NOT PLACED VERY WELL 
THAT IS O. K. HE LOOKS TO HAVE THE 
RED IN THE MIDDLE NOTHING AT THE 
BOTTOM OF THE PACK 
HE IS COMING TO THAT CRUCIAL STAGE 
AGAIN IN THIS FRAME IN WHICH A FEW 
TIMES IN THIS MATCH JOE SLIPPED UP 
HE WILL BE AWARE OF THAT IT IS ONE 
OF THE THINGS THEN NEGATIVE 
THOUGHTS WHICH IS DIFFICULT FOR 
PLAYERS TO GET RID OUT THE 
NEGATIVE THOUGHTS WHICH IS 
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GET RID OF 
ADD THERE OUT THERE THIS IS A 
TOUGH ONE WELL PLAYED HE COULD 
HAVE DONE WITH ANOTHER FEW INCHES 
AROUND THE CUE BALL TO MAKE IT EASY 
QUITE NICELY PLAYED AND NICE CAN 
AND ON THAT RED A QUICK GLANCE AT 
THE SCOREBOARD HE WILL BE AWARE 
THAT FRAME BALL IS COMING UP 
SO JOE PERRY GIVES THE IMPRESSION 
HERE THAT HE IS GOING TO WIN THIS 
FRAME AND IT WOULD SUGGEST THAT HE 
WILL NOT BE HIND OVERNIGHT WILL 
CERTAINLY INTO TONIGHT'S SESSION 
BEACH BEHIND HE IS SAFE NOW I 
THINK WHEN YOU THINK THAT HE 
STARTED THE SESSION BEHIND BY 
FIVE THREE HE HAS DONE WELL HERE 
HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE SETTLED FOR 
EIGHT TO EIGHT OVER THE MORNING SESSION BUT 
HE HAS GOT A CHANCE TO LEAD 
HE HAS PLAYED THE BEST OF THE TWO 
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT STUART BINGHAM 
HAS STRUGGLED THE ODD GLIMPSE OF 
HIS BEST GENERALLY SPEAKING IT 
HAS NOT REALLY BEEN HIS MORNING 
A BREAK OF SEVENTY EIGHT FOR JOE PERRY HE 
LEADS STUART BINGHAM EIGHT TO SEVEN 
SEVENTY EIGHT THAT IS JOE'S HIGHEST BREAK OF 
THIS SECOND ROUND CONTEST HE HAD 
THREE CENTURIES AGAINST GRAEME DOTT 
IN THE OPENING ROUND A VERY 
DIFFERENT GAME THIS THE LAST FRAME 
OF THE SESSION A BIG GAME IT IS 
STUART BINGHAM AT THE TABLE 
SLIGHTLY BEHIND THE LAST GAME OF 
THE SESSION 
WHEN YOU PLAY A LOT OF SAFETY IT 
TAKES AWAY YOUR READ THEM WHEN YOU 
HAVE CHANCE YOUR RHYTHM I I AGREE WITH THAT BUT THE RED IT 
WAS ON IF YOU MISSED IT IT ADDED 
TO THE PRESSURE AS WELL 
THE ONE TO THE RIGHT TO THE PINK 
WASN'T THERE I THINK HE WOULD HAVE 
KNOCKED THAT IN YOU KNOW 
IT IS AMAZING WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS 
GAME WE SPOKE ABOUT STUART BINGHAM 
AND HIS LONG POTTING AND HOW GOOD 
JOE PERRY IS AT THE SAFETY GAME 
AND AFTER THAT IT WAS JOE PERRY 
THAT MADE A SAVE IN THE SAFETY AND 
MISSED A LONG PASS POT 
HE SHOULD TAKE A CHANCE TO MOVE ONE 
OF THE REDS OF THE PINK IF HE HAS 
GOT A NICE ANGLE 
HE NEEDS TO GO BACK UP FOR THE BLUE 
THERE IS A RED THERE THAT IS 
AVAILABLE IN TO THE RIGHT CENTRE 
IF HE STOPS SHORT BUT HE IS O. K. 
HE NEEDED TO HOLD THE CUE BALL FOR 
THE REDS HEAD OF TWO CUSHIONS 
PERFECT HE TOOK OFF 
HE PLAYED ON THE PINK HE HAS AN 
ANGLE FOR THE NEXT RED THE 
SLIGHTLY AWKWARD ANGLE ON THIS 
HE PLAYED THAT O. K. A LEAD OF THIRTY ONE 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF REDS IN THE 
CENTRE OF THE TABLE ONE OF THE 
REDS IN THE CENTRE WILL CERTAINLY 
POT INTO THE RIGHT POCKET HE IS 
NICELY STRAIGHT ON THE PINK 
IF HE FINISHED NICELY HE COULD 
PLAY ON THE BLACK AND THE RED ALL 
IN ALL GOOD MORNING FOR JOE PERRY 
COMFORTABLE NOW THIS HAS BEEN A 
VERY GOOD EFFORT THIS HAS COME 
AFTER A LONG BOUT OF SAFETY PLAY 
AND GOOD QUALITY SAFETY FROM BOTH 
PLAYERS HE DIDN'T MISS A RED THEY 
JUST DIDN'T GET A CHANCE THEY'RE 
ALL AT THE E. C. AT THE MOMENT FOR JOE 
PERRY ALL CREDIT TO HIM THEY'RE 
ALL LOOKING EASY AT THE MOMENT HE 
STARTED AT FIVE TO THREE BEHIND HIS POT 
SUCCESS IS VERY HIGH 
THIS HAS BEEN A GOOD SESSION 
PLAYED AT QUITE A BRISK PACE 
THAT IS ONE WAY OF GETTING ON THE 
PINK 
A BIT OF EXHIBITION STUFF FROM JOE 
PERRY THE CROWD ENJOYING THAT 
HE PLAYED THE DOUBLE ON THE BLACK 
NOT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE BUT A GOOD 
SESSION DRUMMER JOE PERRY GOING 
INTO TONIGHT'S SESSION IN FRONT 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE MATCH SO 
FAR 
IT ALWAYS LOOKED TOUGH IT WAS FAR TOUGH TO CALL THE WINNER THE 
PLAYERS ARE SIMILAR IN THE WAY THEY 
PLAY JOE WILL BE DELIGHTED WITH 
THAT COMING INTO THE SESSION FIVE TO THREE 
DOWN HE WON THAT MANY SESSION SIX TO TWO 
HAVING SPOKEN TO STUART AND HIM 
SAYING HE COULDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT 
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF 
SNOOKER PLAYERS GO THROUGH THE 
BRAIN WILL NOT SWITCH OFF EVERY EVERY ROUND AFTER EVERY SESSION THE 
SAME THING FOOTBALLERS GET IT 
AFTER MATCHES YOU WILL BE SITTING 
UNTIL THREE A M. WATCHING THE T. V. UNTIL 
YOUR BRAIN SWITCHES OFF IT CAN 
HAPPEN A LOT YOU KEEP WAITING AND 
YOU'D SLEEP FITFULLY HE COULD DO 
WITH A LITTLE SLEEP THIS AFTERNOON 
IN TERMS OF THE PRESSURE ON HIM 
PROBABLY MORE SO THAN JOE BECAUSE 
JOE HAS GUARANTEED HIMSELF A PLACE 
IN THE TOP SIXTEEN HE OWES YOU A BIG 
DRINK FOR THAT BEATING YOU IN THE 
FINAL QUALIFYING ROUND STUART 
KNOWS HE HAS TO GET TO THE SEMI 
FINALS TO HAVE A CHANCE 
IT IS WE 
KNOW IT IS THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
SO THERE IS PRESSURE ON JOE 
BECAUSE HE THINKS HE HAS A CHANCE 
FOR PAUL STUART NOT ONLY THAT 
ALSO THAT IT IS A BIG CHANCE IN 
TERMS OF QUALIFYING FOUR STUART A A LONG DAY FOR THESE MEN THEY WILL 
BE COMING BACK THIS EVENING TO A 
FINISH THAT MATCH BEFORE WE GO AND

TIME TO SEE WHO HAS TURNED UP AT 
THE TRAINING STATION TODAY 
HI WHAT IS YOUR NAME JERRY JERRY O'NEILL 
I VAGUELY RECOGNISE YOU O'NEILL I PLAYED TO COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IN 
AN EXHIBITION AT ROTHERHAM WHO WHO WON 
IT WAS CLOSE BUT I CAME WON SECOND 
THAT IS ALL RIGHT HAVE YOU SECOND GOT ANY QUERIES OR QUESTIONS I I COULD DO WITH 
A TIP OR TWO L. HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE RED ON THE 
CUSHION PUTTING IT IN THE CORNER 
POCKET 
GENERALLY THE POCKET PROFESSIONALS BUT A BIT OF SIDE ON 
GO ON SHAUN 
IT IS WEIRD HOW IT 
WORKS YOU WOULD NOT THINK HITTING 
IT ON THE SIDE IT WOULD HELP THE 
POT AT ALL FOR SOME REASON 
BECAUSE IT IS NEXT TO THE CUSHION 
JUST PLAY IT WITH A BIT OF RIGHT 
HAND SIDE FRACTION LEE AND IT 
SEEMS TO MAKE THE RED HARDER THE 
CUSHION 
IT BASICALLY KICKS IT CUSHION FORWARD THE OTHER THING IS YOU 
NEED A FAIR BIT OF ANGLE FOR THIS 
SHOT AT LEAST FORTY FIVE DEGREES 
IF THE 
WHITE WAS THERE YOU WOULDN'T BE 
ABLE TO PLAY IT THE WHITE IS 
TAKING CARE OF ITSELF ON THESE 
SHOTS 
A LITTLE LATER PUSH THE RED SHOTS ALONG THE CUSHION WATCH THIS A 
BIT OF SIDE ON IT THE RED WAS JUST 
HUGGING CUE BALL IS PERFECT A 
LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE WANT TO 
HAVE A GO 
I'LL HAVE A GO IT LOOKS 
EASY PERFECT 
WELL WORTH IT THANK YOU PERFECT VERY MUCH 
IT WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM

RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HELD A NARROW FIVE TO THREE 
LEAD OVER MARK WILLIAMS AS THEY 
BEGAN THE MIDDLE SESSION OF THEIR 
SECOND ROUND MATCH THAT WAS CUT TO 
FIVE TO FOUR AS MARK TOOK THE OPENING FRAME 
THE TENTH WAS TIGHT BUT A GREAT 
POSITIONAL POT ON THE YELLOW TO GET 
TO AN AWKWARD GREEN RESTORED 
O'SULLIVAN'S TWO FRAME ADVANTAGE 
WILLIAMS SEEMS LIKE A MAN REBORN OF 
LATE THOUGH AND HE TOOK THE ELEVENTH 
SIX TO FIVE TO RONNIE NOW O'SULLIVAN 
RESPONDED IN CLASSIC FASHION TWO 
RED POTTED AND THE START OF THE 
CENTURY BREAK THE FIRST OF THE 
SESSION

WITH THIS O'SULLIVAN DOUBLE ON THE 
GREEN EIGHT TO FIVE TO RONNIE AND 
CLEAR DAYLIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IN THIS SESSION A SEVENTY EIGHT IN FRAME FOURTEEN 
GAVE RONNIE NINE TO FIVE ADVANTAGE 
ALTHOUGH THIS RATHER WILD SHOT IN 
THE FIFTEENTH ALLOWED MARK TO STEP IN 
AND MAKE AN EIGHTY ONE BREAK AND THE 
DOGGED WELSHMAN TOOK THE FINAL 
FRAME OF THE EVENING WITH A FINE 
SEVENTY THREE TO PEG O'SULLIVAN BACK NINE TO SEVEN

BLINK AND YOU'VE MISSED HIM 
BECAUSE HERE COMES THE ROCKET 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
THE USUAL UNDERSTATED INTRODUCTIONS 
FROM ROB WALKER BOTH MATCHES ARE 
AVAILABLE TO DUDE ON THE RED BUTTON 
ON INTERACTIVE WE ARE GOING TO 
STAY ON TABLE ONE TO VIEW 
WILLIE THORNE AND DENNIS TAYLOR ARE 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS I AM SURE 
YOU BET YOUR SWEET POT WE ARE 
HAZEL YOUR SWEETHEART THE 
ATMOSPHERE ONCE AGAIN HIS ELECTRIC 
RONNIE BACK TO BREAKING OFF WITH 
HIS LEFT HAND 
NOT A BAD BREAK OF SHOT THE ONLY 
PROBLEM RED HAS GONE RIGHT NEXT 
THE BLACK AND TIED IT UP 
THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD RETURN SAFETY 
FROM MARK WILLIAMS 
DO YOU THINK HE HAS GOT THE PACE OF 
THE TABLE WILLIE 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT 
I'M SURE ALL THE VIEWERS WATCHED 
THE OPENING TWO SESSIONS WHAT A 
MATCH WE HAVE HAD BOTH PLAYERS HAD 
BEEN GOOD IN THE BREAK BUILDING 
DEPARTMENT IN ONLY TWO FRAMES HAS 
THERE NOT BEEN A BREAK OF FIFTY OR 
ABOVE 
MARK WILLIAMS GOT BIG BREAKS TO 
STAKE IN THE MATCH AT NINE TO SEVEN WHAT A 
BRICK FRAME THIS IS TO STAY IN 
THE MATCH 
EIRIAN WILLIAMS JUST ASKED PAUL 
SOMEBODY JUST TO TURN THEIR 
EARPIECE DOWN LITTLE BIT ASKED 
FOR SOMEBODY IT IS THE STANDARD 
PINK TODAY IN ALL THESE TOURNAMENTS 
THEY CAN PICK UP THE B. B. C. COMMENTARY 
WILL STOP A STANDARD THING THIS 
IS SUCH A SMALL THEATRE NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY PEOPLE 
THEY ARE ALL PRETTY CLOSE TO THE 
TABLE IT IS IMPORTANT THE PLAYERS 
DON'T HEAR ANY NOISE 
THE PLAYERS OF COURSE CAN'T HEAR 
THE COMMENTATORS WHICH IS SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT FROM WHEN WHISPERING TED 
LOWE USED TO COMMENTATE HE USED TO 
SIT IN THE THIRD OR FOURTH ROW IN THE 
EARLY DAYS AND COMMENTATE ON 
MATCH THAT IS WHAT HE IS LOOKING 
AT THERE 
I KNOW TED STILL TUNES IN TO WATCH 
THE SNOOKER L. HOPE YOU ARE KEEPING WELL TED AND YOUR WIFE JEAN 
IT IS NICE TO SEE MARK WILLIAMS 
PLAYING WELL AGAIN HE HAS BEEN A 
BIT OUT OF THE GAME AS FAR AS 
WINNING TOURNAMENTS IS CONCERNED 
FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS HE 
ALMOST DROPPED OUT OF THE TOP THIRTY TWO 
WHICH IS UNBELIEVABLE WHEN MOST 
PLAYERS WOULD STILL MENTION HIM IN 
THE TOP FOUR OR FIVE PLAYERS IN THE 
WORLD 
WHEN HE WAS NINE TO FIVE DOWN OUT WORLD LOUD LAST EVENING HE SAID 
PONTIN'S HERE I COME IF HE LOSES 
THIS MATCH HE HAS TO GO TO THE 
QUALIFYING MATCHES AT PONTIN'S 
BUT THE TWO FRAMES HE PLAYED AT THE 
END OF THE MATCH HAS GOT HIM RIGHT 
BACK IN IT 
WE ARE ONLY THREE AND A HALF 
MINUTES IN AND ALREADY WE HAVE SEEN 
SOME EXCELLENT SAFETY 
THAT WAS TOUGH HE PLAYED IT WELL THAT IS FIVE OR SIX SAFETY SHOT ON 
THE TROT THAT HAVE BEEN WITHIN FOUR 
OR FIVE INCHES OF THE BAULK CUSHION 
AND FROM DIFFICULT POSITIONS 
EXCELLENT SAFETY 
HE HAS A WAY DOWN OFF THAT ONE OR 
THE ONE IN FRONT OF IT 
IF HE PLAYS THIS HE IS GOING TO 
HAVE TO SCREW BACK INTO BAULK 
AREA THERE IS AN EASIER SAFETY 
SHOT BUT AS IT HAS RUN IN BRITAIN 
RUN INTO AN OPEN POCKET HE MIGHT 
BE TEMPTED 
HE HAS LEFT A CHOICE OF REDS ONE 
IN THE BAULK AND ONE IN THE CORNER 
IF YOU DON'T CATCH THE JAWS OF THE 
SHOT TO NOTHING SEVEN OR EIGHT OUT 
OF TEN TIMES THEY END UP BEING 
STUCK UP HE DIDN'T REALLY GET THE 
JAWS THAT IS WHY IT CAME IN AND 
OUT OF BAULK 
AND THERE YOU SEE THE LONG POT 
SUCCESS RATE RONNIE RAPIDLY RISING 
HE WAS AT NINE PER CENT BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
AFTER THE FIRST SESSION WHEN HE 
WAS IN AMONGST THE BALLS HE WAS 
CUEING EXTREMELY WELL 
IT IS A FAIRLY HIGH STANDARD THAT 
WILLIE 
ANYTHING ABOVE NINETY IS GREAT WILLIE PLAYING ANYBODY ELSE MARK WILLIAMS 
WOULD BE NINE TO SEVEN IN FRONT AT LEAST 
WITH THAT POT SUCCESS RATE TOUGH 
TO SEE A HIGH BREAK WITH BLACK AND 
PINK AWKWARD 
IF HE COULD GET UP THAT SIDE OF THE 
TABLE HE WOULD LEAVE THE RED NEXT 
TO THE PINK AND THEN HE WOULD FREE 
IT BUT I DON'T THINK HE HAS A GOOD 
ANGLE ON THE GREEN TO DO THAT 
WELL HE DID MANAGE TO GET IT 
ACROSS HE HAS CHOICE OF REDS 
WELL HE COULD FREE THE PINK NOW I 
SUPPOSE 
ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE OF SUPPOSE HOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU GET 
TOPSIDE OF THE BLUE HE DIDN'T WANT 
TO FINISH SHORT YOU ALWAYS HAVE 
THE BAULK COLOURS TO COME TO YOUR 
RESCUE 
THE PROBLEM FOR RONNIE IS THE RED 
IN THE CIRCLE 
IT WAS A CHANGE OF PLAN THERE IT HAS WORKED OUT GOOD BECAUSE HE HAS MADE THE PINK POTTABLE 
I THINK THE PINK WILL STILL SPOT 
IF IT GOES IN 
IN A COUPLE OF SHOTS FROM NOT 
LOOKING AS LIKE AS THOUGH HE 
COULD POSSIBLY SCORE ENOUGH TO WIN 
THE FRAME HE NOW HAS A FRAME 
WINNING OPPORTUNITY 
I THINK RONNIE KNEW ONLY TOO WELL 
HE HAD TO GET OFF TO A GOOD START 
IN THE LAST TWO FRAMES MARK 
WILLIAMS HAD BREAKS OF EIGHTY ONE AND SEVENTY THREE TO 
GET BACK TO JUST TWO BEHIND HE 
LOOKS IN PRETTY GOOD FORM HERE THIS 
AFTERNOON RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
CUEING VERY SMOOTHLY 
YES IT IS NOT OFTEN YOU CAN 
SUGGEST OF FORTY OR FIFTY BREAK IS AS 
GOOD AS A CENTURY BUT ANYTHING 
ABOVE FIFTY HERE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY 
TOP DRAW BLACK OUT OF PLAY PINK 
OUT OF PLAY FOR THE FIRST FORTY POINTS 
IF HE MAKES A FRAME WINNING BREAK 
FROM HERE HE HAS DONE REMARKABLY 
WELL 
STILL A POSSIBLE SIXTY SEVEN LEFT ON THE 
TABLE WITH FIVE REDS 
HE NEEDS ONE MORE RED THE STANDARD 
REALLY HAS BEEN VERY HIGH IN THIS 
MATCH 
HE PLAYS THAT SCREW SHOT SO MUCH 
SOFTER THAN A LOT OF PLAYERS A LOT 
OF PLAYERS HAVE TO HIT THE BALL A 
LOT HARDER THAT IS WHY RONNIE IS 
SO GOOD AT MAKING THE BALL MOVE 
WITH PRECIOUS LITTLE POWER HE IS 
AMAZING 
MARK WILLIAMS PUTS HIS CUE ON THE 
TABLE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN ONLY 
NEEDED ONE CHANCE TO CLINCH THE 
FRAME WITH BREAK OF SEVENTY ONE 
SO A THREE FRAME GAP OBSERVATIONS 
ABOUT THE START OF THIS SESSION 
VERY FLUENT AGAIN FROM RONNIE 
FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A SEVENTY 
BREAK THERE HAS BEEN SERIOUS 
SCORING IN THE LAST FEW FRAMES 
EVERY TIME HE HAS GONE FOR THAT GAP 
MARK HAS HAD AN ANSWER HE HAS GOT 
IT BACK TO TWO STARTING THIS 
SESSION STEVE 
ONE OF THE SESSION STEVE DIFFICULTY DIFFICULTIES ABOUT 
TRYING TO OVERCOME RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN IF HE HAS BULLIED IS 
EVEN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN UNDER 
PRESSURE EVEN IN THE HEAT OF THE 
MOMENT CAN MAKE THE BALLS GO INTO 
THE POCKETS EASILY THEREFORE IT IS 
TOUGH TO KEEP HIM UNDER WRAPS VERY 
RARELY DOES HE SEES UP LIKE SOME 
PLAYERS DO MARK WILLIAMS'S JOB IS 
MADE MUCH HARDER BUT MARK IS 
PLAYING BETTER SNOOKER HE HAS 
PRODUCED DECENT STUFF IN THIS MATCH 
HE MUST BE BUOYED UP BY THAT TO 
GET OVER THE LINE IS ANOTHER HURDLE 
ANOTHER STEP BUT YOU NEVER KNOW I I THINK HE SURPRISED A FEW PEOPLE 
LAST NIGHT WHEN HE WON THE LAST 
COUPLE OF FRAMES 
WITH SINGLE FRAME 
CONTRIBUTIONS SEVENTY AND EIGHTY TO GET 
BACK INTO IT HE HAS HIT THE BALL 
WELL HE JUST NEEDS TO GET A RESULT 
AND GET HIS CONFIDENCE BACK 
UNFORTUNATELY HE IS PLAYING THE 
TOURNAMENT FAVOURITE SO EVERY 
MISTAKES HE MAKES IS GETTING 
EXAGGERATED 
WE HAVEN'T SEEN MARK EXAGGERATED IN GREAT FORM OVER THE LAST COUPLE 
OF SEASONS DO YOU BEGIN TO SEE THE 
SHOOTS OF RECOVERY FROM HIM 
YES I 
THINK HE IS SLOWLY GETTING USED TO 
HIS NEW CUE HE HAS HAD IT FOR A 
YEAR IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM 
HIS OLD ONE IT TAKES TIME TO TUNE 
IN FOR A PLAYER IT IS A BIT FATTER 
THAN HIS OLD CUE CONFIDENCE 
MATCH WINNING CONFIDENCE IS ANOTHER 
MATTER HE WAS NOT IN THE BEST OF 
SHAPES BEFORE HE CHANGED CUES BUT 
I THINK AT ANY ONE TIME A PLAY IT 
IS EITHER GOING DOWN IN FORM OR 
COMING OUT OF FORM MARK WILLIAMS 
IS ON THE WAY IT UP A PLAYER 
BUT WINNING FORM IS TOUGHER THE 
SUPERIORITY COMPLEX HE HAD A FEW 
YEARS AGO THAT IS TOUGH TO GET 
BACK LET'S GO BACK TO THEM LIVE 
A SLIGHTLY LONGER BREAK TAKEN BY 
MARK WILLIAMS THERE SOMETIMES YOU 
LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR AND 
TRY AND CHEER YOURSELF UP HE 
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG IN THE 
LAST FRAME APART FROM THAT ONE LONG 
POT THAT HE WAS PLAYING AS SHOT 
TO NOTHING IT CAME RIGHT BACK INTO 
BAULK THE SEVENTY ONE BEIT SEVENTY ONE BREAK WAS 
TOP DRAW 
WELL WATCH OUT THERE IS A ROCKET 
ABOUT WHEN HE STARTS KNOCKING 
THESE ONES IN HE COULD AND BY A 
LONG POT IN THE OPENING SESSION 
ONE IN ELEVEN HE COULDN'T BY A LONG 
POT 
AS FAR AS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS 
CONCERNED THE IMPORTANT SCORE LINE 
IS THAT HE IS THREE IN FRONT 
BLACK IS TIED UP AT THE MOMENT AS 
YOU CAN SEE PINK IS AVAILABLE INTO 
A COUPLE OF POCKETS THE POSITION WAS SPOT ON HERE 
DENNIS AND I HAD THE PLEASURE OF 
DOING THE STUDIO YESTERDAY EVENING 
FOR THE SECOND SESSION OF THIS 
MATCH SUGGESTED RONNIE SEEMED TO 
BE GETTING TUNED IN THE LONGER THE 
MATCH WENT HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE 
THAT TUNED IN IN THE FIRST MATCH 
AGAINST THE CHINESE BOY OR IN THE 
FIRST SESSION AGAINST MARK WILLIAMS 
TODAY HE LOOKED LIKE HE IS HERE 
FOR A BATTLE AND WANTS TO PLAY 
HE LOOKS 
JUST LOOKING TO SEE WHAT WOULD 
HAPPEN HE USUALLY PLAYS THIS 
WITH STUN AND DOESN'T STICK IN THE 
PACK 
IT HAS TURNED OUT O. K. BUT HE DIDN'T 
GET THE CANNON AS HE ANTICIPATED 
HE WAS PLAYING INTO THE GAP BETWEEN 
THAT RED AND THE OTHER TO OPEN THEM 
USUALLY WHEN YOU ARE CUEING WELL 
AND THINGS ARE GOING WELL YOU WILL 
GET A RUN OF THE BALL HE DIDN'T 
OPEN THE PACK BUT THAT ONE LANDED 
OVER THE MIDDLE POCKET 
THIS IS THE SHOT HE WAS PLAYING HE 
WAS TRYING TO CANNON THE TWO REDS 
BUT HE JUST CAUGHT THE ONE RED FULL 
BALL 
IN JUST UNDER FOUR MINUTES 
INCLUDING MARK WILLIAMS'S PAUL 
BREAK OFF SHOT HE IS ALREADY AT THIRTY SEVEN 
AND COUNTING PAUL BREAK OFF SHOT 
HE IS NOT GUARANTEED TO GET A GOOD 
CANNON POOR 
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF 
PLANTING ONE INTO THE CORNER POCKET 
I THINK THAT IS THE REASON HE 
REFUSED TO PLAYING TO IT TO PLAY 
IT IN TO IT CAN HE JUDGE THE CANNON THIS TIME 
HE GOT IT HALF BALL THAT TIME BUT 
HE STILL MIGHT BE UNLUCKY HE HIT 
THAT ABSOLUTELY PERFECT BUT AT THE 
WHITE JUST STUCK IN THERE TWO REDS 
BUT THE WHITE 
IT CANNONED THE 
TWO REDS EXACTLY THE SAME BOTH 
TIMES TO STOP IT TOOK ALL THE PACE 
OUT OF THE CUE BALL BOTH TIMES 
LOTS OF NOISE FROM THE OTHER TABLE 
BUT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN LOOKS SO 
FOCUSED THAT I BET HE DIDN'T EVEN 
HEAR IT THIS IS THE BEST HE HAS 
LOOKED IN THIS MATCH SO FAR 
HE HAS MADE THE HIGHEST BREAK OF 
THE TOURNAMENT ONE HUNDRED FORTY BUT HIS 
FOCUS WHAT A TIME TO GET AHEAD 
CONTACT AND A BAD KICK HEAVY CONTACT 
THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONTACT KICKS I HAVE EVER SEEN THE BLUE 
FINISHED THREE INCHES AWAY FROM THE 
POCKET THAT IS INCREDIBLE 
IF MARK WILLIAMS COULD SOMEHOW 
MANAGED TO STEAL THIS FRAME THAT 
WOULD REALLY HURT MANAGE THE THE DREADED KICK AGAIN 
HE DIDN'T GET ON THE PINK AS HE 
WANTED TO THAT WAS NOT A VERY GOOD 
OPENING A SHOT THAT MARK PLAYED HE 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN STRAIGHTER ON THAT 
PINK DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO MISS 
THAT 
WHAT MAKES MATTERS WORK THAT WORSE DENNIS HE IS BEHIND NOW 
VERY CLEVER IT DIDN'T PLAY TO GET 
ON THE BLACK JUST POT THE RED AND 
KEEP IT SAFE IF HE DIDN'T GET THERE 
THE WAY HE IS PLAYING HE ISN'T 
GOING TO MISS MUCH AT THE MOMENT 
WE HAVE ONLY PLAYED ONE AND A HALF 
FRAMES AND ALREADY RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HIS CUEING BETTER THAN 
HE HAS BEEN THIS TOURNAMENT SO FAR 
THAT HAS MADE IT VIRTUALLY 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR MARKED TO WIN THIS 
FRAME MARK THE PINK IS SAFE 
THE YELLOW IS SAFE 
I DON'T BLAME MARK FOR CARRYING ON 
YOU NO MATTER HOW MANY SNOOKERS HE 
NEEDS HE WILL WANT TO KEEP RUNNING 
AWAY FROM THE TABLE FOR A WHILE 
HE WILL WANT TO KEEP RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN AWAY 
HE DID WELL TO GET THE BLACK ON TO 
IT SPOT BEAR ONTO ITS SPOT 
THERE IS A LOT OF WORK FROM MARK 
WILLIAMS TO JUNE THE FOR MARK 
WILLIAMS TO DO 
THAT WAS A GREAT EFFORT THAT IS 
UNLUCKY A GOOD EFFORT 
BUT THERE THAN THE PINK THAT MARK 
MIST INTO THE MIDDLE POCKET HE HAS 
DONE PRECIOUS LITTLE WRONG OTHER 
THAN THE PINK THAT MARKED HAD 
MISSED THE OPENING SHOT BUT HE 
PLAYED WHEN HE TRIED TO NOKIA LONG 
RED IN AND DID NOT GET IT THAT 
WAS HIS ONLY SHOT TRIED TO KNOCK 
A LONG RED WIN IAN 
MARCHWIEL HAS DECIDED TO CONCEDE 
MARK WILLIAMS DECIDED TO CONCEDE 
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT THUNDEROUS 
KICK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL OVER 
IN THAT FRAME LOT MORE QUICKER 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN LOOKS TO BE 
HEADING COMFORTABLY INTO THE NEXT 
ROUND AS WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE MARK 
WILLIAMS HAS HAD THE ABILITY TO 
COME BACK BUT IT IS GETTING CLOSER 
TO THE FINISHING LINE 
HE SPOTTED 
SOMETHING IN THAT FRAME YOU WANTED 
TO SHOW WAS 
IT WAS A POSITIONAL 
SHOT WHERE RONNIE WAS ON THE BLUE 
THE BLACK WAS OUT OF COMMISSION HE 
PLAYS THIS BEAUTIFULLY DROPS THE 
BLUE IN HE HAS GOT THE PERFECT 
ANGLE TO BE HIGHER ON THE RED HE 
GETS DOWN KNOCKS THIS IN FLICKS 
ON THE BLACK ALL OF A SUDDEN THE 
BALL IS IN A BEAUTIFUL POSITION 
THAT IS WHY HE IS SUCH A GREAT 
BREAK BUILDER 
FROM WHAT WE HAVE 
SEEN DOES HE LOOK MORE OPERA TODAY 
BAN IN THE LAST COUPLE 
I FELT AT 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN WAS GOING TO COME 
IN WITH HIS HEAD DOWN DOES HE 
LOOK MORE UP FOR IT TO DATE THAN IN 
THE LAST COUPLE SO FAR IN THE 
TOURNAMENT THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE 
HE STARTS TO GET A BIT MORE FRANTIC 
EVERY DAY YOU'RE PLAYING THAT IS 
WHEN PLAYERS CAN UNRAVEL L. THINK 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN WOULD BE VERY 
COMPOSED FOR ALL OF THIS TOURNAMENT 
IT WILL TAKE SOME HOLDING 
HE WILL 
TAKE SOME HOLDING FROM MARK 
WILLIAMS BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT 
MORE TO DO IN THE THIRD OF THIS 
SESSION 
DENNIS SOUZA MAC CAN SEE THIS RED 
OF THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE 
MARK CAN SEE THIS RED OF THE 
RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE UP 
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR 
A NUMBER OF YEARS ONE OF THE BEST 
SINGLE BALL POTTER'S WE HAVE EVER 
SEEN IN THE GAME PAUL POTTERS 
PAUL THERE IS ONE SURE THING ABOUT 
MARK WILLIAMS HE WILL NOT GIVE A 
P. C. HE WILL FIGHT TO THE BITTER END 
HE WILL NOT GIVE UP EASY 
HE CLOSED YESTERDAY EVENING WITH 
TWO FRAME WINNING BREAKS WHAT HE 
WOULDN'T GIVE FOR THAT NOW TO 
GOING TO THE INTERVAL ANY OTHER 
SCORE LINE IT WOULD BE HARD TO SEE 
HIM GETTING OUT OF IT SIXTEEN BREAKS 
OUT A FIFTY ALREADY IN THIS MATCH 
OUT OF FIFTY 
IT JUST DEPENDS WHETHER ONE OF THE 
RED SPOTS INTO THE LEFT HAND CORNER 
IF NOT HE CAN PLAY A CANNON ONTO 
THE TWO ON THE RIGHT 
HE PLAYED A CANNON AND HE PLAYED IT 
PERFECTLY 
A CLEVER SHOT IF HE GOES A BIT TOO 
HARD HE HAS THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE 
POCKET THIS IS THE KEY SHOT COMING UP HERE 
AN AWKWARD BUNCH HE NEEDS TO GET 
PLENTY OF PACE ON THIS 
THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO FULLY COMMITTED 
THAT HE COULD BE IN HALF 
FOUL 
PLAYING WITH A BIT MORE TOUCH AND 
PACE RATHER THAN TRYING TO FLICK 
THE EDGE LET'S SEE IF RONNIE 
CANNOT ANOTHER LONG ONE IN CAN 
KNOCK 
THAT WAS A FRACTION THICK DENNIS 
SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THE PRACTICE 
TABLE GETTING THOSE BETTER THAT 
IS PERFECT IT FINISHED LOW ON THE 
RED 
THAT WAS A LITTLE UNFORTUNATE 
PLAYED WITH A LOT OF TOP SPIN TO 
FORCE THROUGH THE BUNCH IT POWERS 
ITS WAY THROUGH THE REDS GENERATES 
A LOT OF SPIN THIS IS TRICKY 
CANNAE GET THROUGH THAT GAP CAN 
HE 
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT WOULD DO 
WOULD YOU TO CUE AS WELL AS THAT 
HE IS REALLY ON TOP OF THIS GAME AT 
THE MOMENT HIS GAME 
THE REDS ARE AS THEY ARE REMEMBER 
A FEW MOMENTS AGO HE POWERED 
THROUGH RED AND BROUGHT ALL OF 
THESE IN TO PLAY HE CAME TO THE 
TABLE TWENTY ODD POINTS BEHIND HE IS 
FAVOURITE TO WIN THE FRAME FROM 
HERE THIS KIND OF SHOT YOU PLAY 
FOR MORE THAN ONE RED YOU GET 
OPTIONS YOU'RE ALWAYS GIVING 
YOURSELF OPTIONS 
HE DOESN'T MATTER HOW HE FINISHES 
ON THE BLACK BECAUSE IT HAD THE 
FIVE FRIENDS ARE FINISHED 
BECAUSE OF HOW THE FIVE REDS ARE 
FINISHED 
APART FROM THE KICK WHEN HE MISSED 
THE BLUE I CANNOT IMAGINE 
REMEMBER ANYTHING HE HAS MISSED 
IT IS THE WAY HE IS PUSHING THE CUE 
THROUGH HE GETS THROUGH THAT BALL 
SO WELL 
THIS IS THE SEVENTEENTH BREAK OUT OF FIFTY 
THIS IS MARVELLOUS NEW CAREER 
SNOOKER 
EVEN THERE HE RAN SNOOKER SLIGHTLY OUT OF POSITION GETS DOWN 
LEFT HANDED AND MAKES IT LOOK SO 
EASY 
ELEVEN MINUTES FOR ONE FRAME TWELVE 
MINUTES FOR THE OTHER THIS ONE HAS 
JUST BEEN GOING JUST OVER EIGHT 
MINUTES 
HEATING GET EXACTLY ONE HUNDRED THE WAY HE 
PLAYED HIS BREAK IT WOULD BE AN 
INJUSTICE THAT HE DOESN'T MAKE ONE HUNDRED 
HE CAN GET YOU COULDN'T BE MORE 
IMPRESSED AT WE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
HAS BEEN PLAYING THIS AFTERNOON 
AT THE WAY 
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE STUFF FROM 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IT REALLY IS 
NOW A CENTURY ABSOLUTELY 
INCREDIBLE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN GOES 
FURTHER AHEAD AND NOW USE JUST ONE 
PLACE AWAY FROM VICTORY HE IS 
WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH A PLAYER WHEN 
HE IS PLAYING LIKE THIS WILLIE IF 
HE WERE TO BE A BIT CRITICAL OF 
MARK WE SAY HE DOES NOT LIKE TO GO 
INTO THE BUNCH BUT THERE WAS A 
SHOT WHERE HE WAS ON THE BLACK 
MOST PLAYERS WOULD HAVE PLAYED INTO 
THIS WITH A LOT OF PACE BUT HE 
PLAYED GENTLY TO TRY AND FLICKED 
ONE HOWARD 
YOU MENTIONED IN CONT 
YOU MENTIONED IN COMMENTARY HE WAS 
A BIT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AS A 
WHOLE MARK WILLIAMS HAS PLAYED AS 
GOOD AS WE HAVE SEEN HIM IN THIS 
MATCH AGAINST ANYBODY ELSE HE 
WOULD BE WINNING 
I COULDN'T AGREE 
MORE HE HAS PUT UP A GOOD 
PERFORMANCE WHEN YOU PLAY AN 
OPPONENT PLAYING THE WAY HE IS YOU 
CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
BECAUSE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HAS 
KNOCKED EVERYTHING IN THAT HE HAS 
GONE FOR 
THE LAST THREE FRAMES ARE 
AS NEAR AS I HAVE SEEN TOO PERFECT 
SNOOKER FOR A LONG TIME MARK 
WILLIAMS IS GOING TO HOPE HE BREAKS 
OFF AGAIN IN THIS MATCH IF HE DOES 
HE IS STILL IN IT THIS IS THE LAST 
TIME HE COULD BREAK IN THIS EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
SURELY HE CAN'T KNOCK THIS ONE IN 
AS WELL 
THAT WAS THE ONLY RED HE COULD SEE 
THAT IS THE FIRST PARTY HAS MISSED 
SO FAR THIS AFTERNOON IT WAS 
SITTER THE FIRST POT IT WAS THE 
ONLY RED HE COULD SEE AND IT WAS 
WHERE PADDING AGO IT WAS WORTH 
HAVING GO 
IT WASN'T THAT FAR AWAY HE CUED IT 
PRETTY WELL 
ED HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT THE LAST 
CENTURY BREAK WAS MADE IN SIX 
MINUTES AND ELEVEN SECONDS I HAD 
JUST BEEN INFORMED THAT IS THE 
FASTER CENTURY IN THE CRUCIBLE THIS 
YEAR 
IT TAKES SOME PLAYERS THAT LONG TO 
BREAK OFF SOMETIMES DOESN'T IT 
YOU CANNOT SAY THAT ABOUT OUR 
BODIES BUDDY'S 
FANTASTIC IF THE BLACK GOES IN 
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY YOU WILL SCORE 
HERE IT IS A TRICKY LITTLE BLACK 
YOU NEVER EVER RECALL ANYTHING HE 
HAS POTTED ONE BLACK HE WILL BE 
TRYING TO STAY AND THE BLACK ON 
THE BLACK THESE BALLS ARE PERFECT 
THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
SLIGHTLY UNDERHIT THIS BUT HE CAN 
GET AROUND THE BLACK I'M NOT SURE 
IF HE CAN CURE THIS EASILY TO STUN 
ON FOR THE BLACK CUE THIS 
HE IS HITTING THE BALL SO WELL 
WHEN YOU CUE AT YOUR BEST EVEN IN 
YOUR OWN MIND YOU SOMETIMES 
GENERATE MORE SPIN THEN YOU MEAN TO 
HE IS GETTING SO MUCH MOVEMENT OF 
THE CUE BALL HE IS SOMETIMES 
MOVING OFF POSITION BECAUSE HE IS 
TOO GOOD 
THIS WOULD BE THE FOURTH BLACK COMING 
UP STEPHEN HENDRY HAS MADE EIGHT 
MAXIMUM BREAKS IN COMPETITIVE PLAY 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HAS MADE EIGHT 
MAXIMUM BREAKS IN COMPETITIVE PLAY 
HE MIGHT BE AFTER ANOTHER RECORD 
THE REASON HE IS TAKING A RED AT 
THE BOTTOM OF THE BUNCH IT GIVES 
HIM MORE TARGETS TO POT FOR THE 
BLACK HE KNOWS HE HAS GOT ONE TO 
THE LEFT AND ONE TO THE RIGHT 
THIS IS KEY IF THIS WORKS OUT HE 
IS STUCK ON THEM BUT HE STILL HAS 
ONE FOR THE MIDDLE 
HAS HE GOT A BIT OF ANGLE TO TRY 
AND GET BACK TO THE BLACK OFF THIS 
ONE 
THERE WASN'T A LOT OF ANGLE THERE 
BUT HE MADE IT 
THERE IS A BUZZ GOING AROUND THE 
CRUCIBLE THEATRE THEY KNOW WHAT IS 
HAPPENING HERE 
JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR MAY HAVE 
TO GET THE EXTENSION OUT HERE HE 
WILL NEED TO PLAY DELICATE LITTLE 
SHOT TO DROP ON THE BLACK IT 
SHOULD NOT BE PROBLEM MARK IS 
JUST WONDERING HOW MANY HE IS GOING 
TO SCORE HERE 
HE HAS JUST FLIPS THAT READ THE THE CROWD ARE HOPING THEY WILL WITNESS 
A BIT OF HISTORY HE JUST FLICKED 
THAT RED 
HE NEEDS TO TRAVEL A LITTLE BIT HE 
STILL HAS ONE MORE KISS TO PLAY 
THIS IS THE NORMAL PLAY THIS IS 
A PHENOMENAL PLAYER 
JUST ONE MORE 
RED TO KNOCK MARK WILLIAMS OUT OF 
THIS EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
THAT WILL SEND MARK TO THE 
QUALIFYING SCHOOL IT WILL TAKE HIM 
OUT OF THE TOP SIXTEEN 
MARK KNOWS IT IS 
ALL OVER NOW HE WILL WISH RONNIE A 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN AND NOBODY BEGRUDGES ANY BODY 
THAT 
WHEN WILL HE PLAY BE CANNON I DO 
NOT KNOW THAT ONE OF THE REDS POTS 
IT DOES IT DOES 
HE WANTED TO GO A LITTLE BIT 
FURTHER AND HE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO 
FREE THE ONE NEXT TO THE PINK THAT 
IS THE KEY ONE NOW HE HAS THAT THE 
ANGLIA HE HAS NOT GOT THE ANGLE 
HERE IT LOOKS TIRED FROM THAT 
ANGLE IT DOESN'T GO TIGHT WHAT A SHOT HE TRIED IT 
THAT IS ONE OF THE BEST POSITIONAL 
SHOTS I HAVE EVER SEEN IT WAS 
ALMOST STRAIGHT 
TO GENERATE THAT 
ANGLE TO GET THE CANNON AND TO 
CONTROL IT HE DESERVES ONE NOW ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND AVAILABLE FOR THE MAXIMUM THIS IS PERFECT 
FOUR COLOURS TO BEAT THE RECORD

WONDERFUL DISPLAY 
FROM RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IT IS HARD

CRUCIBLE BUT HE CAN CLEAR THEM ALL 
UP ANYWAY HE WAS ON TOP TIER A FEW 
YEARS AGO TOP CIARA 
CALL GO 
HE IS COMING UP TO THE FIRST CORNER 
MY WORD SOME BACKS THAN THERE HE 
IS OFF THE TRACK HE IS COMING UP 
TO SO CACKLE CHICAGO HOW IS HE 
GOING HERE ONE MORE OR RED THE 
CAR IS RACING TOWARDS THE 
HAMMERHEAD GET OUT THE WAY 
WORLD'S WORST REFEREE THAT IS ALL 
THE RENTS GONE REDS WILL LOOK 
AT THE SCREEN IT WILL SLOW YOU 
DOWN DON'T LOOK 
HE IS REALLY MOVING NOW HE IS 
NEARLY OFF THE TRACK DAWN CAR 
AND GO ON 
HE MISSED HE IS COMING UP TO THE 
LAST CORNER 
AND NOW HE HAS CROSSED THE LINE 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN 
I HAVE GOT THE STORY O'SULLIVAN NOW THAT WAS ROME MAY WAS MY CAR 
THE MAN CAN POT THEM UNDER PRESSURE 
THAT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO L. THINK 
MR. CLARKE'S AND CLARKSON WAS VERY 
IMPRESSED BY IT WHAT ABOUT THE 
HAMSTER WORE HIS THOUGHTS WHAT 
ARE HIS THOUGHTS 
AS A GAME IT HAS 
GOT PARTICULAR DRAMA AND TENSION L. 
AM TERRIBLE AT IT IT IS NOT A 
SKILL THING IT IS NOT BECAUSE I AM 
SHORT WHEN YOU KNOW THAT POINT IN 
THE EVENING THEY PILE ON THE 
PRESSURE TO PLAY SNOOKER L. DO L. 
TAKE MY FIRST SHOT AND YOU CAN HEAR 
A SILENCE WHEN OTHER PEOPLE THINK 
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG THE MORE 
YOU DRINK IN A BAR THE BETTER YOU 
THINK YOU ARE JUST LIKE THE MORE 
ATTRACTIVE YOU THINK YOU ARE THAT 
IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION L. USED 
TO LIKE WATCHING IT ON BLACK AND 
WHITE 
I SHOULD NOT BE TALKING TO YOU 
ANYWAY BECAUSE YOU KEEP ON KNOCKING 
US OFF AIR SNOOKER BY RIGHT I 
SHOULD NOT BE HERE BUT WE ARE NOT 
ON AIR THIS TIME SO YOU CANNOT 
KNOCK US OFF 
AND YOU WILL BE 
WATCHING 
YES WALKING DOWN THOSE WATCHING STAIRS MUST FEEL PARTICULARLY 
INTENSE THEY HAVE SPENT SO MANY 
HOURS PALING ON IT IT MUST BE 
TOUGH PRACTISING WE ARE NOT 
DRIVING CARS VERY FAST DURING 
PRACTICE BECAUSE YOU ARE AROUND WE 
ARE ALWAYS ON SOFAS L. L. WISHED I HAD 
A JOB TO GO TO BUT I HAVEN'T 
BECAUSE I HAVE THE SNOOKER IS ON 
IT IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE FOR ME L. 
CAN'T PLAY AND EVERY TIME IT IS ON 
I AM OFF THE TELLY SO I DON'T LIKE 
IT BUT 
I WILL BE WATCHING I THINK 
THERE WAS A BIT SENSITIVE HE DOES 
LOVE IT SECURELY ARE YOU A FAN OF 
HIS PROGRAMME 
I THINK EVERYBODY 
WANTS TO DO THE CHALLENGE 
SECRETLY 
HAVE YOU NOT BEEN INVITED SECRETLY TO TAKE PART 
NO L. WON'T GO ROUND 
THERE PRETTY QUICK 
NEVER MIND LET 
US HEAD BACK INTO THE CRUCIBLE YOU 
WILL HAVE SEEN THE OTHER MATCH 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE AND NEIL ROBERTSON 
THE MATCH LOOKED LIKE IT WAS OVER 
WHEN IT STARTED STEPHEN NAQOURA 
INFLICTED A WHITEWASH STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE HIS FATHER OF RESISTANCE 
FROM ROBINSON LEG TO ELEVEN TO FIVE A 
SPARK OF RESISTANCE HE COULD GET THROUGH THAT THE OTHER OPTION IS THE BLUE 
THIS MAKES THE POT DIFFICULT IT IS 
CLOSE TO THE KITCHEN CUSHION 
GREAT SHOT HE KNEW HE WAS GOING 
INTO THE REDS THE BLUE IS 
ON THE PINK SPOT 
OPERA DURING BUT HE DID NOT HAVE TO 
DO ANYTHING AWKWARD CUEING IF 
HE HAS GOT A SLIGHT ANGLE ON THE 
PINK HE CAN SCREW INTO THE REDS 
HE BROUGHT A FEW MORE INTO PLAY 
JOB DONE AS LONG AS YOU HAVE GOT A 
STARTER WHICH HE HAS IT IS O. K. 
I THINK WHAT HAS STOPPED HIM IS 
THAT HE IS TO STRAY ON THE RED 
SAINT HE CAN ROLL IT IN HE IS TOO 
STRAIGHT 
HE IS SCORING BLACK FOR BLUE 
SCREWING BACK 
NICE SHOT HE WOULD WANT TO BE ON 
THE PINK THAT IS THE RED THAT IS 
NEXT TO THE PINK AND BLACK HE LOOKS LIKE HE HAS ENOUGH ANGLE 
YES HE CAN DROP IT IN HE PLAYED 
IT NICELY HE DID NOT WANT TO POT 
THE BLACK BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE 
TIED THE PINK UP HE HAS PLAYED THE LAST SHOTS NICELY 
NOW HE HAS GOT THE ANGLE TOO MUCH 
INTO THE FIVE REDS TO NUDGE INTO 
THE FIVE 
HE DID NOT PLAY IT ALL THAT WELL HE WENT INTO THE RED TO FOOL TO FOOL HE IS ON NOTHING NOW IT IS END OF BREAK THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD HE KNOWS THAT STEPHEN MAGUIRE CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER MISTAKE 
ANOTHER THING ON THIS MATCH LAST 
NIGHT I THINK ROBERSON WHEN HE 
WAS NINE TO ZERO DOWN HE HAD GIVEN UP 
NEIL ROBERTSON KNOWS HE CAN MAKE A 
COMEBACK 
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE SHOT COMEBACK HE IS LUCKY HE COULD NOT HAVE 
PLAYED THAT SHOT ANY WORSE AMAZING AMAZING HE GOT THE RUN OF THE BALL THERE HE IS USING THE SPIDER BUT IT LOOKS AWKWARD 
I AM ASSUMING HE HAS COVERED THE 
STRAIGHTER OF THE THREE REDS MACK 
THAT WAS NOT THE BEST OF SHOTS FROM 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE TO LEAVE THAT ONE 
ON THIS IS THE CHANCE 
ROBERSON LOOKED QUITE PHASED IN THE 
EARLY SESSION 
HE IS STARTING TO GET INTO THE 
MATCH NOW 
THE LONGER YOU CAN KEEP YOUR 
OPPONENT FROM VICTORY IT SHOULD 
GIVE YOU SOME LEEWAY 
WELL DID HE FORGET THE PINK WOULD 
GO BACK ON TO ITS OWN SPOT IT WAS DEFINITELY A MISTAKE RIGHT INTO THE HEART OF THE POCKET HE HAS ACHIEVED HIS FIRST GOAL 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE WILL NOT COME BACK 
TO THE TABLE 
MORE THAN ENOUGH NEIL ROBERTSON 
ROOMS IT WINS THE FIRST FRAME A 
LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE CREEPS UP ON 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
NEIL IS NOT READY 
TO GO BACK TO MELBOURNE JUST YET 
HE WON THE NEXT FRAME AS WELL 
THERE WAS A GROAN FROM THE CROWD 
HOWEVER HE GOT THE BALL BACK INTO 
THE BAULK END 
IS THIS A CHANCE FOR STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE TO POT HIS FIRST BALL OF 
THE SESSION 
THE RED IS IN HE CANNOT GET 
THROUGH TO THE BLACK THE PINK IS 
TRICKY IF IT GOALS GOALS 
GOES 
THAT WAS SWEET IT WAS GOOD CUEING 
FOR SOMEBODY WHO HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN 
MUCH TABLE TIME 
HE EXPECTS STEPHEN MAGUIRE TO WIN A 
FRAME BUT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE 
DIFFERENT 
HE IS NOT QUITE STRAIGHT ENOUGH ON 
THE BLACK TO HOLD EASILY FOR THE 
RED THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT 
HE HAS DONE WELL HERE IT WAS ONLY 
REALLY A HALF CHANCE THE OPENING 
RED WAS NOT EASY A CHOICE OF RED REDS IT APPEARS 
DECIDED TO PLAY FOR THE BLACK HE 
MIGHT STILL PLAY FOR THE PINK IT 
DEPENDS WHAT SORT OF AN ANGLE HE 
HAS HERE PINK GIVES HIM AUTOMATIC 
POSITION WHEREAS WITH THE BLACK 
HE WILL HAVE TO DO A LITTLE BIT 
WITH THE CUE BALL 
HE JUST HAD ENOUGH ANGLE TO FORCE 
IT OVER 
NOW WHAT WILL GO TO THIS RIGHT 
CORNER WELL IT JUST ABOUT GOES 
HE HAD THE ANGLE TO RUN THROUGH 
NICELY FOR THE BLACK IN THE 
OPPOSITE CORNER SO THIS IS NOW AN 
EXCELLENT CHANCE 
SLIGHTLY OVERSCREWED HE WOULD 
RATHER NOT HAVE TO USE THE REST 
OBVIOUSLY 
NEIL ROBERTSON'S COMEBACK MIGHT 
HAVE COME TO AN END NOW IN FRAMES 
HE WON FIVE IN A ROW DOWN HE WON 
FIVE IN A ROW BEFORE THIS 
IT IS A LONG WAY BACK TO WIN THE 
MATCH BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE MAN 
AT THE TABLE HAS BEEN IN GOOD FORM 
HE WON THE FIRST EIGHT FRAMES 
AGAINST ANTHONY HAMILTON 
AND THEN HE WON THE FIRST NINE IN 
THIS MATCH SO GIVEN HALF A CHANCE 
AND SOME APPLAUSE FROM THE AUDIENCE 
IT TELLS US HE HAS JUST ABOUT 
SECURED THE FRAME IN ONE VISIT HE 
HAS DONE WELL HERE 
JUST TO ADD TO WHAT YOU WERE SAYING 
THIS IS VERY IMPRESSIVE 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORRYING TIMES 
WHEN YOUR OPPONENT HAS WON FIVE 
FRAMES IN SUCCESSION WHEN HE HAS 
GOT THE CHANCE HE HAS TAKEN THEM 
WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM 
AND OF COURSE HE HAS BEEN MADE 
JOINT FAVOURITE FOR THE TOURNAMENT 
ALONG WITH RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
THEY ARE IN SEPARATE HALVES SO 
THEY WOULD MEET UNTIL THE FINAL 
THEY WOULD NOT MEET BUT THERE ARE 
QUITE A FEW BALLS AND FRAMES TO BE 
PLAYED BEFORE THEN A MARVELLOUS 
CENTURY BREAK FROM STEPHEN 
WELL THE PINK WILL NOT MATTER 
NEIL ROBERTSON WILL CONCEDE 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE AT LAST HAS GOT A 
FRAME ON THE BOARD HE WILL BE 
THINKING 
HE IS WITHIN ONE FRAME OF A PLACE 
IN THE QUARTER FINAL 
YES HIS THIRD CENTURY OF THE MATCH 
HE MAY BE ON THE BRINK BUT 
ROBERTSON IS PUTTING UP STUBBORN 
RESISTANCE IN FRAME TWENTY FORTY SEVEN POINTS 
UP HE MISSED THAT BY A LONG WAY 
REFEREE MICHAELA TABB JUST ASKING 
FOR THE CORRIDOR DOOR TO BE CLOSED 
SHE COULD OBVIOUSLY HERE ON THE 
FLOOR SOME PEOPLE TALKING SHE 
COULD HERE ANYWAY BACK TO THE 
TABLE AND NEIL ROBERTSON MISSING 
THAT RED BY SUCH A DISTANCE THAT 
THE RED CAME UP TO THE BAULK END 
WELL HE HAS KNOCKED IT IN BUT HE 
IS HAMPERED FOR THE BROWN BY THE 
GREEN HE WILL DO WELL TO POT THE 
BROWN AND FORCED THE CUE BALL UP TO 
THIS END OF THE TABLE IF HE IS 
STRIKING DOWN FORCED OTHER THAN 
THAT HE COULD CUT THE YELLOW IN 
THE EASY WAY OUT TO ROLL UP TO THE 
GREEN 
WELL THAT IS ONE WAY HE HAS GOT 
TO AVOID THE PINK HE HAS GOT TO 
AVOID THE RED ON THE SIDE CUSHION 
IT IS WORTH GO BECAUSE THAT IS 
THE ONLY RED IT APPEARS TO ME HE 
CAN MAKE CONTACT WITH AND NOT LEAVE 
HIS OPPONENT AN EASY POT ON BUT 
WHEN YOU ARE UP AT THAT END AND 
LOOKING DOWN YOU SEE THE PINK AS 
BIG BALL YOU SEE THE RED BUT I 
DON'T SEE ANY OTHER OPTION 
AS YOU 
SAY IF YOU MISS THE PINK AND THE 
RED I THINK THE SHOT YOU PUT UP IS 
ON JOHN IT IS A QUESTION OF BEING 
A GUIDE PERHAPS HE IS LOOKING AT 
THE SHOT OFF THE SIDE CUSHION I'M 
NOT SURE IF HE IS LOOKING AT THAT 
PARTICULAR SHOT CAN HE GET OUT OF 
THE SHOT LIKE THIS CERTAINLY THE 
RED DOWN AT THE BOTTOM LEFT OF THE 
CORNER IS THE ONE YOU ARE LOOKING 
TO LAY IN BEHIND IF POSSIBLE 
HE DIDN'T HIT IT THOUGHT BALL 
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUS 
AND THAT WAS THE PROBLEM FOUR BALL 
IT WAS A GOOD HIT BUT IF HE DIDN'T 
HIT IT FULL BALL HE WAS ALWAYS 
GOING TO KNOCK IT ON 
SO STEPHEN MAGUIRE CAME TO THE 
TABLE FORTY SIX POINTS BEHIND AS NEIL 
ROBERTSON PLAYED HIS LAST SHOT IN 
THIS YEAR'S EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
OR WAR THERE WILL THE RED ON THE 
LEFT HAND SIDE CUSHION COME TO HIS 
RESCUE 
HE WAS SLIGHTLY STRETCHING ON THAT 
ONE L. STILL HOT TAKE I STILL 
THOUGHT HE WOULD PROBABLY GET IT 
JUST STRETCHING ACROSS ATTEMPTED 
TO GET BACK UP THE TABLE FOR THE 
BLACK NOT BAD 
OBVIOUSLY THE TWO REDS IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE TABLE ROUND ABOUT 
THE PINK SPOT AREA NEITHER OF THEM 
WILL GO IN THE LEFT CORNER BEING 
FORTY POINTS BEHIND STEPHEN HAS TO BE 
VERY CAREFUL 
NEIL ROBERTSON IS ONLY LOOKING FOR 
ONE MORE CHANCE YOU FEEL 
WELL HE HAS TO PLAY A SAFETY SHOT 
SURELY OFF THE RED TO THE RIGHT OF 
THE PINK IT IS AN EASY PATH BACK 
TO BAULK ANYTHING ELSE HE IS 
DANGEROUS IT LOOKS THE OBVIOUS 
SHOT TO ME SOMETIMES YOU CAN 
COMPLICATE THINGS BY GIVING THEM 
TOO MUCH THOUGHT SUPPOSE THE 
ONLY THING HE IS SLIGHTLY WORRIED 
ABOUT IS THAT RED IF HE HITS IT 
TOO THICK HE MIGHT BRING THE RED 
AWAY FROM THE RIGHT HAND CUSHION 
WHICH AT THE MOMENT IS HIS 
INSURANCE 
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT THAT IS A 
VERY GOOD SHOT 
YES HE PLAYED IT 
VERY WELL 
HE IS STILL THINKING POSITIVE EVEN 
THOUGH THE ODDS ARE AGAINST HIM 
HE DIDN'T A LOT ON THAT SAFETY 
SHOT HE DID WELL TO AVOID THE 
DOUBLE KISS 
NEIL IS MAY BE THINKING ABOUT THE 
POT INTO THE LEFT CENTRE IT IS 
TRICKY WHERE HE WILL BE CUEING 
FROM HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE 
THE POCKET OPENING ITSELF IF HE 
DECIDES TO PLAY IT THIN RED LEFT 
CENTRE WHERE DOES THE CUE BALL GO 
ROUND TOWARDS THE GREEN THAT WAS A THIN ONE 
HE ERRED ON THE SIDE OF HITTING IT 
TOO THICK IF YOU ARE GOING TO MISS 
IT HE WOULD RATHER HIT IT TOO 
THICK THAN TOO THIN 
TERRIFIC POT TERRIFIC POT THAT 
WAS 
GOOD CUEING CUED STRAIGHT AS A DIE 
AUTOMATICALLY ON THE BLACK IF THE 
RED WENT IN 
ON THE RED TO THE LEFT CENTRE 
LOOKING AT THE OTHER FOUR REDS IT 
WILL NOT BE EASY TO MAKE 
CLEARANCE BOTH SETS OF REDS ARE 
STUCK TOGETHER BIT THEY DON'T 
BOTH POT INTO EVERY POCKET 
I WAS 
JUST THINKING THEY LOOK AS IF BOTH 
COULD BE MADE INTO PLANTS 
A BIT OF WORK TO DO JUST TRYING TO 
NUDGE THEM OPEN L. THINK HE HAS 
MADE BEAT SEPARATED THEM ENOUGH TO 
MAKE ONE AVAILABLE HE HAS MAYBE 
ESPECIALLY IF HE HAS ENOUGH SLIGHT ANGLE ON THE BLUE 
HE IS LOOKING AT WHERE HE CAN GET 
FROM THE BLUE TO FORCE AN ANGLE 
HE FORCED THE CUE BALL DOWN AND 
THAT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
THERE WAS NOT VERY BIG GAP HE 
COULD GET INTO GREAT SHOT HE IS 
THINKING A FEW SHOTS IN FRONT HERE 
KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THE TWO UP 
THE TABLE ON NOW HIS FOR THE TAKING 
ARE NOW HIS FOR THE TAKING HE IS 
TRYING TO WORK OUT A PLAN TO 
DISLODGE THE OTHER TWO REDS THAT 
ARE STUCK TOGETHER 
WELL HE WAS LOOKING AS MANY AS 
TWO OR THREE SHOTS AGO TO MAYBE 
PLAY AND POT THIS RED AND GET ON 
THE PINK TO MOVE THE OTHER TWO 
THAT WASN'T WHAT THAT WAS WHAT HE 
LOOKED AT INITIALLY BUT HE IS NOW 
GOING TO PLAY OFF THE BLUE HE HAS 
GOT QUITE A BIG TARGET HE WOULD 
LIKE TO HIT THE FIRST RED AND PUSH 
THE SECOND ONE ON 
HE HAS THOUGHT 
ABOUT THE PLANT BUT HE WOULD MUCH 
RATHER PLAY THE CANNON AND TRY TO 
BRING THEM INTO PLAY IT IS NOT A 
STRAIGHT FORWARD PLANT BY ANY 
MEANS NINETEEN POINTS BEHIND AT THE 
MOMENT 
I SUPPOSE THE PLOT IS NOT MOMENT SO BAD IF YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
BEHIND THE FIRST RED BUT ANYTHING 
ELSE AT THE PLANT IS NOT SO 
BAD 
HE HAS DECIDED TO PLAY ON IT SO HE 
MUST FANCY IT 
THIS ONE REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF 
THOUGHT 
IT COULD BE A FRAME AND THOUGHT MATCH WINNER SHOULD HE MAKE IT 
A GOOD SHOT AND HE WILL NOT MIND 
THE DOUBLE KISS THAT HE HAD EITHER 
ON THE RED THAT HE HIT INITIALLY 
THAT PUSHED THE CUE BALL UP THE 
TABLE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT LOOKS 
A DIFFERENT FRAME 
GETTING ALL FOUR RED'S OPEN IS THE 
SIGN OF A CLASSY PLAYER IN THE 
PREVIOUS FRAME MAKING A CENTURY 
HE GOT HIS CONFIDENT BACK AFTER 
LONG TIME SITTING OUT WITH GOOD 
PLAY FROM ROBERTSON GOT HIS 
CONFIDENCE BACK 
WELL IF NEIL ROBERTSON DOESN'T GET 
ANOTHER SHOT AND GOES OUT OF THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS HERE HE WILL 
CERTAINLY REMEMBER THE FIRST 
SESSION WHERE HE LOST ALL EIGHT 
FRAMES SINCE THEN HE HAS ALMOST 
HAD THE BETTER OF THINGS 
IT WAS JUST TOO FAR TO COME BACK 
TO COME BACK FROM IN THE MATCH OF 
THIS DURATION IN A MATCH 
ANOTHER TERRIFIC SHOT TO GET THAT 
BIG ANGLE 
HE IS BACK TO HIS FULLY FOCUSED 
BEST AND ALL HE WANTS HIS BLUE AND 
PINK ALL HE WANTS IS 
A TERRIFIC CLEARANCE FROM STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE CONGRATULATIONS FROM THE 
VERY SPORTING NEIL ROBERTSON 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE PUNCHES THE AIR HE 
IS THROUGH TO THE QUARTER FINALS 
STEPHEN JOINS US CONGRATULATIONS 
IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BE 
VERY EASY AND QUICK BUT IN THE END 
HOW MUCH SWEATING DID YOU HAVE TO 
DO 
A LOT TOWARDS THE END L. GOT DO OFF TO A FLYING START LAST NIGHT 
I WAS TRYING MY HARDEST TO GET IT 
DONE SO I COULD HAVE A DAY OFF BUT 
NEIL WHEN HE GOT HIS THREE FRAMES 
AND HE GOT THE ONE TO MAKE ME COME 
BACK TODAY I LOST HEART A WEE BIT 
BUT I CAME OUT TODAY AND I KNEW I 
HAD A JOB TO DO 
I SUPPOSE THE 
PRESSURE WAS OFF HIM AT THAT STAGE 
HE STARTED TO COME BACK AGAIN THERE 
HE STARTED OFF WELL GOT TO TWELVE 
SO ONLY ONE FRAME LEFT AND HE CAME 
OUT AND PLAYED WELL AND COULD BE 
UNDER A BIT OF PRESSURE 
YOU START 
TO GET WORRIED WHEN HE GETS TO 
SEVEN WERE YOU STILL ALL RIGHT NO NO I THOUGHT ONCE HE GETS TO TEN I 
WILL START TWITCHING BUT I HAD A 
LOT OF FRAMES I COULD MESS UP AND 
STILL BE COMFORTABLE 
YOU LOOKED TO 
HAVE TIMED YOUR RUN NICELY WINNING 
IN CHINA A FEW YEARS BACK YOU 
LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE DOMINATING 
ARE YOU A DIFFERENT PLAYER FROM 
THEN 
NOT A DIFFERENT PLAYER I THEN DON'T THINK BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR I WAS 
PROBABLY PLAYING SIMILAR SNOOKER TO 
NOW L. HAVE NOT CHANGED L. DON'T 
REFUSE MUCH PROBABLY A BIT 
MENTALLY STRONGER L. HAVE LOST A 
COUPLE OF MATCHES I SHOULD HAVE WON 
SO THEY SAY WHATEVER IT DOESN'T 
KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER SO I 
SHOULD BE MENTALLY STRONGER YOU YOU LOOKED BURIED FOCUSED ALMOST 
AGGRESSIVE COMING OUT OF THE FIRST 
MATCH VERY FOCUSED L. READ THE 
OTHER WEEK THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE 
THE BOYS A BIT FRIGHTENED OF OF COURSE I DO HE DID IT FOR YEARS 
HE JUST DIDN'T TALK TO ANYBODY I I PREFER TO PLAY AGGRESSIVELY L. PREFER TO OPEN THE BALLS UP LAST 
NIGHT NEIL IS AN AGGRESSIVE PLAYER 
AND LAST NIGHT HE CHANGED HIS 
TACTICS KIND OF THING AND WENT A 
BIT NEGATIVE L. WANTED TO GET IN 
THERE AND GET THE BALLS OPEN AND 
GET GOING KIND OF THING 
DO YOU 
THINK BEING JOINT FAVOURITE WITH 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN DOES THAT BRING 
ANY EXTRA PRESSURE 
I AM NOT JOINT 
FAVOURITE RONNIE IS BY FAR THE 
FAVOURITE WHATEVER THE BOOKIES SAY 
THERE IS NO PRESSURE ON ME 
IT IS 
NOT BAD COMING OFF YOUR DEATHBED 
TO PLAY THIS TOURNAMENT THEY WERE 
SAYING YOU HAD NO CHANCE 
JOHN WAS 
ONE OF THEM THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE 
SAID ARE YOU ALRIGHT L. HEARD YOU 
WERE NOT WELL L. HAD THE FLUKE 
ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO 
YOU HAD MAN FLEW 
THAT IS WORSE 
IT I PLAYED BETTER 
WITH A THE FLU 
YOU WERE OUT THERE 
WHEN RONNIE MADE THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN YOU HAD A 
GOOD CHANCE AGAINST ANTHONY 
HAMILTON L. THINK YOU PUNCHED A 
TILE BUT THE INCENTIVE IS IT 
STILL THERE TO SHARE THE MONEY IS IS IT EIGHTY GRAND L. THINK IT IS STILL 
THERE L. WOULD LOVE TO SEE RONNIE'S 
A PHASED IF SOMEBODY ACTUALLY L. 
DON'T THINK HE WOULD BE CHUFFED 
A RONNIE'S FACE 
DID YOU SEE MUCH 
OF IT 
I WANTED TO POP MY HEAD 
ROUND BUT I WAS SCARED IN CASE HE 
WAS POTTING A BALL IN THAT POCKET 
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER PUTTING 
HIM OFF 
RONNIE AFTERWARDS SAID 
THAT IT WAS A NICE DAY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
AND THE BENTLEY HE WANTED ALL OF A 
SUDDEN THE OPPORTUNITY WOULD BE TO 
CHOPIN DOWN TO SOMETHING ELSE ALDI ALDI OR SOMETHING TWO CHALK HIM DOWN 
THERE IS STILL AN INCENTIVE TO GO 
FOR IT ALSO BECAUSE ONLY YOU OR 
RONNIE COULD POTENTIALLY OVERTAKE 
SHAUN MURPHY TO BE THE WORLD NUMBER 
ONE HOW BIG AN AMBITION IS THAT 
IT IS A BIT OF A GREEN REALLY TO 
BE HONEST IF HE SAYS TO ME JUST 
NOW YOU CAN WIN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP AND THE WORLD NUMBER 
TWO I WOULD TAKE IT IN A MINUTE 
A BIT OF A DREAM L. DON'T FANCY 
BEING INTRODUCED AS WORLD NUMBER 
ONE BUT NOT WORLD CHAMPION TEN 
YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE SAID I 
WOULD RATHER BE WORLD NUMBER ONE 
NOW I WOULD RATHER BE WORLD 
CHAMPION

THIS IS GETTING BIZARRE WE STARTED 
OFF WITH THREE DEBUTANTS IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP LIANG WENBO IS 
COMPARED TO MR. BEAN THAT IS 
BECAUSE OF FEW MISHAPS THAT WE WILL SHOW YOU LATER 
JOE SWAIL AND LIANG WENBO WERE ON 
TABLE ONE YESTERDAY EARLY ON IT WAS 
THE YOUNG MAN FROM CHINA WHO 
HANDLED THE PRESSURE BETTER 
LIANG WENBO POSSESSES ONE OF THE 
STRANGEST BRIDGE HAND GRIPS IN THE 
GAME IT DID NOT HAMPER HIM BY 
CONTRAST CHOSE WILL HAS GOT ONE OF 
THEIR KILLERS 
STRANGEST Q. ACTIONS 
NOTHING WAS GOING RIGHT FOR THE MAN 
FROM ULSTER HE SAW THE FUNNY SIDE 
OF THINGS 
IN FRAME FIVE LIANG WENBO SHOWED 
HIM WAS AND SHOWED US ALL THE 
ASPECTS OF WHY HE IS SO GOOD 
FOLLOWED BY SLAPSTICK ERROR HE 
RETURNED TO THE SEAT AND WAS 
REMINDED THAT HE WAS STILL ON THE 
TABLE 
HOW ABOUT THIS SHOT HE WAS 
SNOOKERED ON THE FINAL RED 
LIANG WENBO TOOK THE NEXT TWO HIS 
LUCK RAN OUT THE RED WENT IN AT 
THE SAME TIME AS THE BLUE HE IS 
ALWAYS QUICK OFF THE MARK LIANG 
WENBO IT IS FRAME NINE 
JUST A FRACTION OUT JOE'S WILL 
CANNOT BE LEAVING HIM THESE HALF 
CHANCES YOU SAW HOW CLOSE HE WAS 
SO SWAIL 
THIS CHINESE IS A GREAT 
POTTER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE 
NICE LONG RED FROM JOE 
HE HE CONTROLLED THE CUE BALL PERFECTLY HE 
IS NOT QUITE CERTAIN HE WOULD HAVE NEEDED MORE ANGLE ON THE BLUE THAN THIS HE HAS PLAYED IT I DON'T THINK HE IS ON MUCH UNLESS HE CAN GET IN 
BETWEEN THE PINK AND THE RED HE 
DOES NOT LOOK TOO HAPPY BUT HE IS 
GETTING THE REST 
WITH THE REDS OPEN NOW THIS IS A 
FRAME CLINCHING CHANCE 
ANOTHER REQUEST FROM SWAIL TO HAVE 
THE CUE BALL CLEANED 
HE HAS GOT TO SAVOUR HE HAS GOT A 
SAVIOUR IN THE BAULK END THERE IS 
A RED THERE HE DOES NOT HAVE MUCH 
ANGLE ON THIS BLUE 
HE IS ON THIS RED HE CONTROLLED IT PERFECTLY HOWEVER 
HE HAS JUST CALLED THE YELLOW THIS 
TIME THE BROWN IS THIN THAT WAS A KEEN SHOT KEY SHOT 
HE HAS DONE THE NEED FULL YOU CAN 
KEEP LIANG WENBO IN HIS CHAIR 
JOE SWAIL HAS NOT MADE A CENTURY IN 
SIXTEEN MATCHES THIS SEASON 
IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR JOE SWAIL TO 
WIN THIS OPENING FRAME 
IT IS EVEN BETTER THAT HE HAS WON 
IT IN CONFIDENT WAY 
HE MISSED THE YELLOW HE MISSED 
THAT CHANCE 
THE BREAK OF SEVENTY ONE 
REDUCES HIS ARREARS TO SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THREE A GOOD 
START TO THE DAY FOR HIM 
THAT WAS 
FAR MORE POSITIVE THAN THE OPENING 
SESSION INTO THE NEXT THERE IS 
ONLY TWELVE POINTS IN IT 
HE DIDN'T HOLD THE CUE BALL HE DID 
NOT PUT ENOUGH ACTION HE SHOULD 
NOT HAVE FINISHED THERE HE IS TEN 
POINTS BEHIND THIS FRAME HAS TAKEN HALF AN HOUR 
WELL HE RAN INTO THE BLUE THAT 
WAS A MINOR OBSTACLE BROWN BLUE 
PINK NEEDED REMEMBER 
NOT A FRIENDLY ANGLE TO GET ON TO 
THE PINK 
HE WILL ATTEMPT TO LEAVE IT DOWN 
THE SIDE CUSHION HE IS LEFT HANDED 
SO HE WOULD NOT NEED TO USE THE 
REST 
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE POWERED THE 
CUE BALL OFF THE BAULK CUSHION 
HE IS TWO POINTS IN FRONT HE ONLY 
NEEDS THE PINK 
WITH THESE TYPES OF SHOTS HE HAS 
TO MAKE THE DECISION DOES HE PLAY 
THE SAFETY 
COULD ATTEND PINK FINISHES SAFE 
A GOOD ATTEMPT 
CHOSE WELL OFF JOE SWAIL THROUGH 
HIS TOLL AND THE AUDIENCE LAUGHED 
AT THAT L. L. DON'T KNOW WHY HE WOULD 
HAVE PLAYED IT IS WELL SOME 
PETULANCE CREPT IN 
THAT IS BECAUSE 
THEY ARE WOUND UP LIKE SPRINGS MORE 
THAN USUAL THERE HAVE BEEN SOME 
BAD INCIDENCES WHICH MUST BE 
OFFICIALLY DISCOURAGED 
FAT PINK NEEDS TO BOUNCE THAT 
PINK DIFFICULT AGAIN IT RUNS SAFE 
THAT HAS BEEN A COUPLE OF GOALS HE 
HAS NOW AT FRAME BALL 
IT WAS IMPERATIVE HE GOT THE PINK 
SAFE 
LIANG WENBO IS LOOKING AGAIN AT 
THIS FIN CUT HE MAY GO FOR IT 
AS IT HAPPENED THE PINK STRUCK THE 
BAULK CUSHION JOB AND THREW BACK 
ALONG THE CUSHION AND JAW 
THE JOES WILL HAS HAD A LOOK AT THE 
FINE CUT AS WELL IT IS A RISKY 
SHOT JOE SWAIL A THIN CUT IT IS A DANGEROUS SHOT FOR ME THAT WAS THE RIGHT SHOT 
YOU KNOW THIS YOUNG MAN IS GOING TO 
TAKE THE POT ON HE DOES NOT TURN 
DOWN ANYTHING THIS TIME HE HAS GOT IT 
JOE SWAIL IS WELL IN CONTENTION BUT 
LIANG WENBO HAS WON IT HE IS 
LEADING 
VERY CLOSE GREAT LEADING COMPOSURE AND MATURITY FROM THE TWENTY ONE 
YEAR OLD JOE SWAIL IS LACKING FIVE 
POINTS IN THIS FRAME 
THIS IS A FOUR BALL PLANT IS HE 
CONTEMPLATING THIS BEST OF LUCK 
WITH THIS ONE YOUNG MAN THIS CANNOT BE THE RIGHT SHOT 
NOT WHEN HE HAS IT PERFECTLY 
FEASIBLE SAFETY 
WELL I WOULD BE RUBBING MY HANDS 
WITH GLEE IF I WAS JOE SWAIL JOE HAS GOT TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT 
THE PINK AND BLACK ARE NOT IN THE 
BEST POSITIONS 
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO WIN THIS 
FRAME 
HE HAS PLAYED THAT BADLY HE WILL 
PLAY AT THE BLUE MUCH MORE THINLY 
HE HAS RELEASED THE BLACK HE MAY PLAY THIS SCREW SHOT IT 
DEPENDS HOW EASY IS IT HOW HE 
SEES IT 
I THOUGHT FOR AN INSTANT THAT THE 
BLACK HAD DEVELOPED BUT IT HAS NOT 
HE CAN SMILE IN ALL HONESTY HE 
WAS NOT THINKING ABOUT THE BLACK 
HE WAS KAREEM BACK FOR THE BLUE 
SCREWING 
VERY SIMILAR TO THE ALL THE OTHER 
RED HE MISSED 
HE PLAYED THAT NICELY IT WAS A 
GOOD PART HE CONTROLLED YOU BALL 
WELL POT GREEN HAS PROBABLY BE 
BETTER ANGLE TO STUMP UP FOR A RED 
IN THE LEFT CORNER THE BETTER 
ANGLE 
HE HAS PLAYED THIS NICELY HE 
IS LOOKING AT THE SCOREBOARD HE IS TWENTY THREE POINTS IN FRONT NO WHERE NEAR THE WINNING LINE YET JOE 
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN ABOVE THE 
BLUE INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT 
THE NEXT RED WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
VIRTUAL CERTAINTY 
IN GOOD PART BUT ONCE AGAIN 
CANNOT GET THAT ANGLE ON THE BLUE 
HE NEEDS POT 
HE NEEDS A GOOD SHOT HERE POSSIBLY 
THE BROWN HE IS SLIGHTLY HAMPERED 
BY THESE READ THAT THE LEFT HAND 
SIDE OF THE TABLE THESE REDS AT 
THE LEFT HAND SIDE L. WOULD NOT 
FANCY PLAYING FOR THE REDS OF THE 
GREEN BECAUSE OF THE PLAYS A RUN 
THROUGH HE MAY RUN INTO THE YELLOW 
IF HE PLAYS HER PLAYS 
HE IS HAVING TO ROLL THE BLUE IN 
AND PLAY THE RED AT LONG DISTANCE 
GONE DOWN A GOOD POT HE 
WILL NOT BE TOO BOTHERED THAT IS 
NOT TOO BAD ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS 
CLEARED THESE REDS WITH COLOURS 
TWO AT A TIME HELPS CLEAR THESE 
REDS 
HE DIDN'T PLAY THAT WELL HE DIDN'T 
INTEND TO BRING THAT AWAY FROM THE 
CUSHION HE MISSED THAT FROM 
POSITION THE TWO REDS IN THE 
MIDDLE WITH COLOURS WOULD HAVE BEEN 
MORE THAN ENOUGH 
HE COULDN'T DO MUCH MORE THERE TO 
MAKE SURE THAT HE POTTED IT 
AT FORTY ONE 
POINT LEAD STILL A POSSIBLE FIFTY ONE 
LEFT ON THE TABLE 
THE EXTRA FIVE POINTS MAY COME IN 
HANDY P. KNOWS IT WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT FOR HIS OPPONENT TO CLEAR 
UP IN ONE VISIT HERE HE KNOWS 
HAD HE GOT THE BLUE HE WOULD HAVE 
TAKEN THE LEFT AND RED THE TWO 
WERE SHOCK FOR NOTHING FOR FRAME BALL THE SHOT 
SO FAR THIS MORNING IT HAS NOT BEEN 
THE TYPE OF GAME THAT LIANG WENBO 
LIKES HE IS A POTTER AND BREAK 
BUILDER ESSENTIALLY SOMEWHAT 
SUSPECT IN HIS SHOT SELECTION AT 
TIMES IN TACTICAL EXCHANGES 
TO STAY RED AND A COLOUR NEEDED 
ANOTHER CHANCE OF CUTTING THIS ONE 
IN JUST A RED 
HE ATTENDED AT BUT IT WAS TOO 
THICK HE ATTEMPTED IT 
YOU CAN HEAR THE REFEREE HAD 
MANAGING WITH THE AUDIENCE A 
MEMBER HAS LEFT HIS MOBILE PHONE ON 
JOE SWAIL IS DEFENDING HIS LEAD BY 
PUTTING A RED SAFE 
HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT A LONG TIME 
BUT PLAYED IT VERY WELL IN THE END FOUL 
THAT MAKES A BID TO THE DIFFERENCE 
NOW JOE SWAIL NEEDS A RED TO LEAD 
LIANG WENBO 
BARRING PENALTY POINTS IT LOOKS AS 
IF JOE SWAIL IS GOING TO WIN THIS 
FRAME HE WILL GET BACK TO THREE 
BEHIND AGAIN THIS WILL BE FOR THE 
SECOND TIME THIS MORNING 
THE BROWN GIVES THEM EXTRA 
INSURANCE TWO SNOOKER'S ARE NEEDED 
NOW SNOOKERS 
WITH THE PINK AND BLACK SAY FOR 
THAT SHOULD BE IT SAFER 
AND INDEED IT WISE JOE TOOK THE 
LAST BEFORE THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL ALSO HE HAS TWO BEHIND 
THEY TOOK A BREATHER AND WE WILL 
DO THE SAME WE HAVE ALL BEEN 
CATCHING A BREATH SINCE WE SAW 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AT WORK THIS 
AFTERNOON HE HAS KNOCKED UP HIS 
THIRD CAREER MAXIMUM BEBO SHOWED 
THAT IN A WHILE THERE IS ONE 
RECORD THAT RONNIE AS ALBAN DOES 
NOT HOLD WE WILL SHOW 
I MOVED UP THE RANKINGS TO ABOUT FORTY FIVE 
FOR NEXT YEAR I AM PRETTY NINE A A PLAYED AT THE CRUCIBLE 
PLAYED ONCE 
THE IF WE LOOK AT THE LEADERBOARD 
WHO HOLDS THE RECORD FOR HER THIS 
IT HAS BEEN HELD FOR KEN DOHERTY 
FOR A LONG TIME 
GRADE IS VERY GOOD 
TO SAY HE IS AN AMATEUR PLAYER HE 
IS VERY GOOD CRAIG 
EVEN TO GET 
THEM DOWN IN A MINUTE IT IS 
FANTASTIC WE HAVE A FEW STRAGGLERS 
AT THE BOTTOM 
TERRY IS STILL IN PROGRESS HE IS 
AT THE SPARE TABLE IN THE CRUCIBLE 
WE'RE TRYING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO 
CLEAR THE COLOURS AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE IT IS ALL ABOUT 
POSITIONING BETWEEN THE TWO OF US 
I THINK WE CAN BREAK THIS RECORD 
WHERE DO WE PUT THE YELLOW 
WE NEED 
TO POT THE YELLOW AND KEEP THE 
WHITE SNOW YOU DO NOT NEED TO ROLL 
AROUND WITH THE WHITE SLOW YOU 
NEED TO POT THE BROWN AND SPUN 
ACROSS TO ME 
THAT IS TERRIBLE THAT IS PERFECT ON THE BLUE THAT IS A GREAT SHOT BY ME HOW 
GOOD AM I SHOULD BE IN THE 
TOURNAMENT STILL 
BETWEEN THE TOUR BUS THIRTY ONE SECONDS 
WE COULDN'T MANAGE IT YOU ARE 
RUBBISH 
YOU ARE RUBBISH YOU RUBBISH YOU SHOULD PLAY STEVE YOU WERE 
TALKING ALL THE WAY THROUGH YOUR 
SHOTS 
IT MAKES A CHANGE CAN SHOTS TALK BETTER THAN I PLAYED THESE 
DAYS 
NO COMMENT ON THAT WE WILL DAYS GO BACK TO THE LIANG WENBO JOE 
SWAIL MATCH LET'S GET INTO THE 
FIRST FRAME AFTER THE INTERVAL 
NOW HE HAS MISSED THE PINK JOE 
SWAIL HAS THE CHANCE TO SNATCH THE 
FRAME 
IT LOOKED AS IF HE COULD DROP THE 
PINK IN DEADWEIGHT SURELY HE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN ON ONE THE MORE 
PACE THE MORE ACCURATE YOU HAVE TO 
BE JOE SWAIL COMES TO THE TABLE 
FIFTY SIX POINTS BEHIND POTS THE BALL SEVENTY FIVE 
LEFT AND THE TABLE SO PLENTY TO 
WORK WITH 
THE PERFECT START HE JUDGED THE 
CANNON WELL 
AN IMPORTANT JUNCTURE THIS WHEN 
LIANG WENBO WAS IN WITH FIFTY SIX IT 
LOOKED AS IF HE WAS GOING TO REOPEN 
EIGHTY THREE FRAME GAP AT FRAME FIVE A 
THREE FRAME GAP 
IF JOE SWAIL CAN CLEAR UP HERE HE 
WILL REDUCE THE DEFICIT TO A SINGLE 
FRAME HE DIDN'T PLAY THAT LAST 
SHOT ALL THAT WELL THOUGH 
IT WAS A 
LITTLE IN BETWEEN HE DIDN'T PLAY 
WITH ANY REAL PURPOSE PEARSON THIS 
RED IN THE MIDDLE HE MISSED A 
COUPLE OF BALLS TO THIS MIDDLE 
POCKET HE IS ON THIS RED HE 
PLAYED THAT NICELY PERFECT ON THE 
BLACK 
THE ONLY SLIGHT PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE 
WHAT WOULD BE THE LAST RED IT IS 
CERTAINLY POSSIBLE INTO THE LEFT 
MIDDLE OFF THE NEXT RED INTO THIS 
BLACK YOU WOULD THINK HE WOULD GO 
FREEVIEW OR BAULK COLOUR IT WOULD 
MAKE THAT BUDGIES YEAR FOR A FEW 
BLUE OR BAULK COLOUR IT WOULD 
MAKE THAT MUCH EASIER 
IF YOU GET THE WRONG ANGLE ON THE 
BLUE YOU COULD HAVE A PROBLEM L. 
WAS GOING TO SAY HE IS O. K. CAN YOU 
ROLL THE BLUE IN AND GET A CANNON 
ON THE PINK 
HE WAS ABLE TO HOLD IT THERE IS NO 
OBVIOUS REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT 
WIN THE FRAME AT HIS VISIT HE HAS GOT TO MIND HIS WORK 
NOT THE BEST UPSHOTS THERE I 
ASSUME HE PAID FOR THE PINK INTO 
THE RIGHT MIDDLE HE IS GOING TO 
NEED THIS CLEARING UP THE PINK 
HE PLAYED FOR THE PINK THIS IS NOT 
AN OPTION NOW HE HAS A CHOICE 
BETWEEN YELLOW AND BROWN TO PLAY 
IT TEAPOTS THE YELLOW IT WILL COME 
BACK UP AND BACK ON ITS OWN SPOT 
IF HE POTS BELOW IS HE GOING TO BE 
ON IT 
ANOTHER INSURER TWO WITH THAT CUE 
BALL WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER INCH 
OR TWO 
THAT WAS A TICKLISH LITTLE THIN ONE 
HE CONTROLLED THE CUE BALL NICELY 
WHERE THE PINK EARS HE STILL NEEDS 
A NICE ANGLE ON THE BLUE THE 
PINK YEARS HE IS IT IS NOT BAD 
HE TOOK THE YELLOW OF THE LAST RED 
YOU NEED THE BLUE PINK AND BLACK 
THIS BLUE BUT SIMONE POINT BEHIND 
WHAT KIND OF A POTTING ANGLE AS HE 
GOT ON THE PINK NOT A BAD ONE HE 
IS A BIT CLOSE TO THE CUSHION FOR 
COMFORT UNBELIEVABLE 
LIANG WENBO LOS THE IDEAL POSITION 
JOE SWAIL MADE SIXTY ONE TO THE PINK 
SOMEHOW HE MISSED THE BLACK FROM 
SHORT RANGE FROM ITS SPOT IT HAS 
MADE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JOE 
SWAIL BEING ONLY ONE FRAME BEHIND 
AND THREE FRAMES BEHIND LIANG 
WENBO LEADS BY EIGHT FRAMES TO FIVE 
THAT WAS A PAINFUL LOSS FOR THE 
BELFAST BOY HE SCRATCHED AND SHOOK 
HIS HEAD FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILST 
LIANG WENBO WENT OUT OF THE REMATCH 
THEY ARE BOTH BACK WENT OUT OF 
THE ARENA 
FROM FORTY TWO IN FRONT JOE SWAIL SHOULD 
CLINCH THE FRAME OF THIS VISIT 
ANOTHER ADVENTUROUS LONG POT THERE 
FROM LIANG WENBO THE GAME HASN'T 
COME VERY EASY TO HIM IN THIS 
SESSION IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING HE 
SHOULD HAVE LOST THE LAST FRAME L. 
THOUGHT THAT THAT A BONUS OF 
WINNING IT MAY HAVE INSPIRED HIM 
IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE DONE 
LIANG WENBO CAN SEE ALL TOO CLEARLY 
WHAT A GREAT CHANCE HE HAS TO REACH 
A WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP QUARTER FINAL 
THAT COULD BE VERY BIG NEWS BACK 
HOME HE HAS NEVER REACHED A LAST 
SIXTEEN HE HAS NEVER DONE THIS IN ANY 
OTHER RANKING TOURNAMENT IN A WAY 
HAVING THIS LEAD HE DOESN'T WANT 
TO MESS IT UP PERHAPS A BIT TOO 
CONSCIOUS OF THAT 
HE IS LOOKING FOR ONE MORE RED 
AFTER THE BLACK YEARS ON THE RED 
HE IS NOW FIFTY NINE POINTS IN FRONT HE 
IS ON THE RED 
THIS WILL HELP HIM PSYCHOLOGICALLY 
AFTER USING THE LAST FRAME AS HE 
DID AMUSING 
HE IS EXPERIENCED 
ENOUGH TO REALISE HAVING WON THIS 
FRAME BUT EVEN IF HE ONLY WINS ONE 
OF THE REMAINING TWO BEFORE LUNCH 
HE WOULD STILL BE IN FOR A VERY 
GOOD SHOUT 
WE HEAR PEOPLE SAYING YOU HAVE GOT 
TO STAY AND THERE NOW THIS IS 
CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THIS STAY IN 
NOW HE HAS WON THIS FRAME 
COMFORTABLY HIS OPPONENT HAS 
MISSED FEW SHOTS WHICH ALWAYS 
HELPS YOU AS A PLAYER YOUR 
OPPONENT MISSING ALWAYS HELPS 
HE HAS SAT THERE WONDERING I WOULD 
THINK B. T. HAS HE HAS HAD A 
DISAPPOINTING FRAME HERE BECAUSE 
HE HAS HE HAD A FEW DECENT HALF 
CHANCES AND NEVER GOT CLOSE TO THE 
POCKET EVEN THIS IS FOR AMUSEMENT ONLY 
THAT FRAME WILL MAKE HIM FEEL 
BETTER AFTER USING THE LAST ONE 
DISAPPOINTINGLY LIANG WENBO STILL 
LEADS BY EIGHT FRAMES TO SIX 
LIANG WENBO CLAIMED THE FIFTEENTH FRAME 
TO MOVE THREE IN FRONT AGAIN NOW 
IT IS JOE SWAIL AT THE TABLE TWO 
POINTS BEHIND IN THE LAST OF THE 
SESSION 
HE WENT FOR THE DOUBLE BUT AIR ON 
THE SIDE OF HITTING IT TO BE IN 
YOUR DRAWER HITTING IT TO BE 
NEAR JAW 
TO BE FAIR TO HIM HE HAS PROBABLY 
WORKED IT OUT IF YOU GET CLOSE 
ENOUGH IT WILL RATTLE THE JOBS IT 
WOULD MOVE AWAY FROM THE POCKET 
IT WILL RATTLE THE JAWS IF HE HAS 
ANY SNIFF OF A POT HE IS GOING TO 
TAKE IT ON HE IS YOUNG YOU SEE 
HE IS FEARLESS HE HAD A SIMPLE CROSS OVER SAFETY AS AN ALTERNATIVE 
NOT A BAD SHOT I THINK THERE IS A 
GAP THERE 
HE IS LOOKING AT IT 
POSSIBLE PLANT AT A POSSIBLE L. 
CANNOT SEE WHERE IT WILL COME FROM 
HE PLAYED IN IT RAGES FOR BALL 
PLANT EARLIER IN THE SESSION AND 
HAD READ JUST FOUR BALL PLANT 
AND OUTRAGES 
THE VERY THICK THAT WAS VERY 
THICK THAT WAS NOT A GOOD SHOT 
IT IS A THIN POTTING ANGLE HERE ON 
THIS RED CAN HE GET CONTROL OF THE 
CUE BALL THAT WAS WELL PLAYED INCH PERFECT 
HE THINKS HE CAN GET THROUGH TO 
THIS 
SOMETIMES YOU CAN CONVINCE 
YOURSELF THAT THE RED GOALS THAT WAS A BIG SHOT 
GOOD SHOT 
HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF BE TRICKY SHOT GOOD SHOT AT ANY TIME EXCELLENT ONE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAS FOUND THAT THE GAP HE IS ON THE RED NOW HE WILL HAVE TO GO OFF FOR A BAULK COLOUR HE WOULD LIKE TO BE ON THE BLUE HE HAS GOT A SLIGHT ANGLE PROBABLY 
STRAIGHTER THAN WHAT HE WOULD HAVE 
LIKED 
HE MAY HAVE TO PLAY FOR THE RED ON 
THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE 
HE DESPERATELY NEEDS AN ANGLE ON 
THE BLACK DON'T THINK HE HAS MUCH OF ONE 
THAT IS PERFECT THAT IS PERFECT 
NOW HE HAS PAVED THE WAY TO A 
CLEARANCE HERE AND TO WIN THIS ALL 
IMPORTANT FINAL FRAME 
HE TRIED TO SWIVEL HIS HIPS HERE 
TRYING TO GET THEIR CUE BALL GOING 
FURTHER IT WAS LIKE AN ILLNESS 
MOVE IT WAS LIKE AN ILL THIS MOVE 
ONE MORE RED AND A COLOUR AFTER THE 
BLACK TO BE CERTAIN CANNOT SEE A PROBLEM 
THIS BLACK WILL LEAVE LIANG AND 
WHEN WILL NEEDING SNOOKERS LIANG 
WENBO 
LIANG WENBO LED SIX HUNDRED TWENTY TWO ON THE 
RESUMPTION SIX HUNDRED TWENTY TWO 
JOE'S WILL SEEMED DEVASTATED TO 
MISS A BLACK BUT HE HAS KEPT 
APPLYING HIMSELF JOE SWAIL EVEN 
THOUGH HE WILL START THE EVENING 
SESSION TWO BEHIND HE IS STILL IN 
WITH A GOOD CHANCE HE TRIED TO CANNON THE REC IT WAS A GOOD FINISH TO THE SESSION 
LIANG WENBO LEADS BY NINE FRAMES TO 
SEVEN 
JOE SWAIL NEVER TO GIVE IN SEVEN HOW WILL IT GO TONIGHT 
HE IS IN A 
TOUGH MATCH TONIGHT JOE'S WILL 
DOES NOT GIVE UP HE HAS A SEMI 
FINALIST HERE TWICE HE CAME BACK 
FROM ADVERSITY L. LED HIM TWELVE TO 
EIGHT AND HE CAME BACK TO WIN HE 
HAS GOT A GREAT TEMPLAR 
TEMPERAMENT HE IS A VERY GOOD 
PLAYER 
I THINK THE FASCINATING PLAYER THING ABOUT LIANG WENBO IS THAT WE 
HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM WITH THE 
SQUEEZE ON HIM 
THAT IS ONE AREA 
THAT JOE SWAIL IS AWARE OF IF HE 
CAN STAY WITH HIM THEN MAYBE YOU 
CAN SEE THE CRACKS OPENING EVERY 
PLAYER STRUGGLES TO GET OVER THE 
FINISHING LINE SOMETIMES JOE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED TO MISS THAT 
BLACK HE PUNCHED THE AIR 
TWO MORE 
REMAINING SPOTS TO BE FILLED LET 
US JUST REMIND YOU OF THE SITUATION 
RYAN DAY KNOCKED OUT THE REIGNING 
CHAMPION JOHN HIGGINS HE WILL PLAY 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
WE HAVE JUST SEEN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
FLOATING AWAY INTO THE NEXT ROUND 
HE WILL EITHER PLAY JOE SWAIL OR 
LIANG WENBO ALI CARTER HAD A 
STUNNING PERFORMANCE TO KNOCK OUT 
SHAUN MURPHY THAT HAS EARNED HIM 
AN DATE AGAINST PETER EBDON NEIL 
ROBERTSON STAGED SOMETHING OF A 
FIGHTBACK NEXT FOR STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
IS EITHER AS JOE PERRY OR STUART 
BINGHAM 
WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT ONE OF 
THE MOST DRAMATIC MOMENTS OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS L. SUGGEST YOU SIT 
DOWN RELAX AND APPRECIATE THE NEXT 
EIGHT MINUTES AND FORTY SEVEN SECONDS GUESS 
WHO IS INVOLVED RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
FANTASTIC IF THE BLACK GOES IN 
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY HE WILL SCORE 
YOU KNOW WHAT HE WILL HAVE IN HIS 
MIND YOU KNOW HE WILL TRY AND 
STAY ON THE BLACK THESE BALLS ARE PERFECT THE RED IN THE MIDDLE IS NOT BAD 
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HIS INTENTIONS 
ARE NOW 
HE IS CREATING SO MUCH MOVEMENT 
FROM THE CUE BALL BECAUSE HE IS 
CUEING SO WELL THIS WILL BE THE FOURTH BLACK 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS MADE IT MAXIMUM 
BREAKS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HAS MADE 
IT IS WELL 
THOSE ARE MAXIMUM BREAKS IN 
COMPETITIVE PLAY RONNIE MAY WELL 
BE AFTER A NEW RECORD 
HE MIGHT PLAY A SPLIT HERE HE IS STUCK ON THEM BUT HE STILL HAS ONE TO THE MIDDLE HAS HE GOT ANGLE HE MADE IT 
THERE IS A BUZZ GOING AROUND THE 
THEATRE 
HE MUST PLAY A DELICATE LITTLE 
SHORT NOW SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM 
HE WENT A LITTLE FAR 
THE CROWD IS HOPING THAT HE WILL 
GET THIS 
THIS IS JUST PHENOMENAL 
JUST ONE 
MORE RED THAT IS TO KNOCK OUT MARK 
WILLIAMS MARK WILLIAMS KNOWS IT IS ALL OVER HE WILL WANT TO WISH RONNIE A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
WHEN WILL HE PLAY THE CANNON THIS 
RED GLOWS GOALS HE HAS NOT GOT THE ANGLE HERE WHAT A SHOT 
THAT IS ONE OF THE BEST POSITIONAL 
SHOT I HAVE EVER SEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND AVAILABLE FOR THE MAXIMUM PERFECT ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
WHEN HE DOES THAT YOU CANNOT 
DISAGREE ABSOLUTE GENIUS DENNIS 
YOU HAVE PICKED THE RIGHT SEAT HOW 
WOULD YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE 
OTHERS 
THAT WAS THE BEST OF THE OTHERS THREE THE SHOT HE PLAYED THAT 
ANGLE HOW HE FORCED IT OUT THE TOP 
CUSHION IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST 
POSITIONAL SHOTS I HAVE EVER SEEN 
THAT'S WHY SAID A COMMENTARY HE HE HAS EARNED AROUND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FROM HIS 
EFFORTS HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A 
BETTER ONE THAN THAT 
I DON'T THINK 
SO HE IS SUCH A GREAT PLAYER HE 
MAKES IT LOOK SO EASY THERE WAS A 
BIZARRE MOMENT PEOPLE ON THE OTHER 
TABLE WERE CLAPPING AS WELL IT 
WAS MARVELLOUS HE IS A MASTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN

YOUR HEAD JOHN AT WHAT POINT DID 
HE KNOW IT WAS ON 
FIRST BALL WE 
HAVE GONE BACK TO SHOW YOU AGAIN 
THE RED HE HIT SO SWEETLY THE 
FIRST BALL THAT WENT IN HE WAS 
LOOKING AT MAXIMUM 
FOR ME THE 
FASCINATING PARTS WAS THE BALANCE 
BETWEEN AGGRESSION AND COMPOSURE 
AT THE SAME TIME LIKE A CHESS 
PLAYER HE HAVE TO THINK AHEAD THE THE WAY HE STARTED COOING THIS 
AFTERNOON HE WAS MISSING LONG 
PAUSE IN THE FIRST SESSION 
EVERYTHING WHEN INTO THE HEART OF 
THE POCKET HE IS ONE OF THE 
COOLEST CUSTOMERS AND DOING THAT 
ALONG WITH STEPHEN HENDRY THIS
