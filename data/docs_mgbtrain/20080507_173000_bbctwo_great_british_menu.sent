THE FIGHT GOES ON ON GREAT BRITISH MENU 
THE BEST CHEFS IN BRITAIN ARE BATTLING FOR THE CHANCE TO PROVE 
THAT OUR CUTTING EDGE COOKING IS AS GOOD AS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD 
THE WINNERS WILL PREPARE A FABULOUS FOUR COURSE MEAL AT THE APEX OF THE ICONIC GHERKIN IN CENTRAL LONDON 
HOSTING THAT MAGNIFICENT BANQUET WILL BE THE CULINARY TRAILBLAZER HESTON BLUMENTHAL 
AND THE GUEST LIST WILL BE BRIMMING WITH TOP CHEFS FROM THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH 
SO OUR CHEFS REALLY ARE FACING THEIR TOUGHEST CHALLENGE YET 
GOING HEAD TO HEAD IN THIS WEEK'S HEAT TO REPRESENT 
THE SOUTHWEST REGION ARE ELISHA CARTER AND CHRIS HORRIDGE 
YOU'RE COOKING FOR YOUR PEERS AND NOT JUST YOUR PEERS IN THE U. K. YOU ARE COOKING FOR WORLD CLASS CHEFS 
I REALLY DO WANT TO GO THROUGH 
I JUST WANT TO DO THE BEST FOOD I COULD EVER DO IN MY CAREER THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
ELISHA CARTER AND CHRIS HORRIDGE ARE TWO OF THE SOUTHWEST'S MOST EXCITING CHEFS 
BUT THEY HAVE LITTLE IN COMMON APART FROM THEIR REGION 
BECAUSE THEY'RE COOKING STYLES ARE RADICALLY DIFFERENT 
THIS WEEK THEY WILL EACH BE CREATING THEIR OWN ORIGINAL FOUR COURSE MEAL 
DESIGNED TO SHOW MODERN BRITISH COOKING AT ITS BEST 
EACH DAY THEY'LL COOK A DIFFERENT COURSE BEFORE THE PRESENTING THEIR FULL MENUS TO THE JUDGES ON FRIDAY 
THEY WILL BE MAKING THE VERY DIFFICULT CHOICE 
AS TO WHETHER IT'S ELISHA OR CHRIS WHO GOES ON TO REPRESENT THE SOUTHWEST IN THE FINAL 
I THINK THE MODERN ELEMENT OF MY STYLE IS 
TAKING CLASSICAL INGREDIENTS AND BRINGING IT UP TO DATE 
THE EXPERIENCE THAT I'M OFFERING IS SAYING LOOK YOU CAN HAVE 
GREAT FLAVOURS GREAT PRESENTATION AND NUTRITION WITHIN THE SAME MEAL 
ELISHA THINKS THAT FINE DINING SHOULD BE LUXURIOUS 
SO FOR HIS STARTER HE'S SERVED 
BUT CHRIS THINKS MODERN BRITISH COOKING 
IS ALL ABOUT CREATING DELICIOUS HEALTHY FOOD 
HE PUT TOGETHER A LIGHT STARTER 
FOR HIS FISH COURSE 
ELISHA CONTINUED HIS DECADENT THEME AND OFFERED 
CHRIS OPTED FOR 
WHICH HE CLAIMS IS VERY GOOD FOR YOU 
THIS YEAR THE RULES HAVE CHANGED 
THE CHEFS CAN BE MORE CREATIVE BECAUSE AS LONG AS THE MAIN INGREDIENT IS FROM THEIR REGION 
THEY CAN NOW COMPLEMENT IT WITH PRODUCE FROM ELSEWHERE 
SO GOODNESS ONLY KNOWS WHAT THESE TWO WILL COME UP WITH FOR THEIR MAIN COURSES ANOTHER HEAVY BOX 
THAT LOOKS VERY HEAVY MY ARMS ARE ACHING 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TODAY 
I'M DOING RABBIT 
WILD RABBIT I'M DOING IT IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS 
TAKE A LEAF OUT OF YOUR BOOK SO I'M GOING TO I KNEW YOU COPIED ME 
I'M GOING TO BE USING THE SHOULDER THE LOIN 
RIBCAGE AND I'LL BE CONFITING THE LEGS A LITTLE BIT AS WELL 
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY I'LL DO IT WITH FLAX OIL INSTEAD OF DUCK FAT 
THEN I'M GOING TO BE DOING A CARROT PUREE 
O. K. 
WILL I BE ABLE TO SEE IN THE DARK NOW 
A BIT OF A THEME ON RABBIT AND CARROT BEATRIX POTTER YOU KNOW 
SO TODAY CHRIS IS SERVING 
BUT YOU ALWAYS KNOW WITH CHRIS 
THAT THERE'S MORE TO HIS DISH THAN MEETS THE EYE 
THE REASON WHY I'M DOING THIS IS BECAUSE TO ABSORB THE BETA CAROTENE 
THE MAIN VITAMIN OR VITAMIN A IN THE CARROT YOU NEED A BIT OF FAT 
THE CONFIT FAT WILL HELP WITH THE ABSORPTION OF THE BETA CAROTENE IN THE CARROT 
SO THE SYNERGY ACTUALLY WORKS WITHIN THE DISH DOES ELISHA LOOK IMPRESSED 
RABBIT RABBIT RABBIT CHRIS I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT TODAY 
I'M DOING FROM OUR LOCAL ESTATE SOME BEAUTIFUL HOGGET 
EVERYONE'S SCARED OF THIS BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE I'M USING TONGUE 
I'M GOING TO CUT IT INTO BEAUTIFUL BATONS AND I'M GOING TO JUST CRISP IT IN THE FRYER 
SO YOU'RE FRYING IT O. K. 
CHRIS HAS BEEN LECTURING ELISHA ABOUT GOOD NUTRITION ALL WEEK 
AND NOW HIS RIVAL'S FINALLY DECIDED TO HIT BACK 
THE BIGGIE NOW I'VE GOT THIS PEARLED SPELT IT'S COUSIN TO WHEAT 
IT'S LOW IN GLUTEN AND PEOPLE WITH WHEAT TOLERANCE CAN USE IT 
THAT'LL BE INTOLERANCE 
ELISHA HAS CHOSEN TO COOK A RACK OF HOGGET WHICH IS A SHEEP 
ONE TO TWO YEARS OLD WITH A LESS INTENSE TASTE THAN MUTTON 
HE'S ALSO MAKING A HOGGET AND CABBAGE TUREEN FRYING THE TONGUE 
AND STUFFING TOMATOES WITH SMOKED AUBERGINE AND SWEETBREADS 
HE'S DRESSING IT WITH A BROAD BEAN AND PEA PUREE 
AND HIS FAVOURITE PEARLED SPELT WHICH HE IS MIXING WITH GARLIC 
YOU'VE GOT LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR MEATS AGAIN 
I KNOW I GOT A RABBIT 
ELISHA IS CERTAINLY USING A LOT OF FINE INGREDIENTS BUT THAT'S 
REALLY NO SURPRISE WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT WHERE HE LIVES AND WORKS 
ELISHA CARTER WAS BORN IN LONDON BUT IS NOW WORKING AS HEAD CHEF 
AT THE LUXURIOUS CHARLTON HOUSE HOTEL AT SHEPTON MALLET IN SOMERSET 
EVER SINCE HIS CHILDHOOD HOLIDAYS ELISHA HAS LOVED THE SOUTHWEST AND HE USES HIS PRECIOUS SPARE TIME 
EXPLORING THE LOCAL COUNTRYSIDE AND BEACHES 
BUT IT'S NOT ONLY THE FRESH AIR AND LANDSCAPES THAT TEMPTED HIM DOWN HERE AS ELISHA LOVES SOURCING 
ALL HIS INGREDIENTS LOCALLY AND BY MOVING TO SOMERSET HE'S IN SHEER CHEFFY HEAVEN 
WHEN I WAS IN LONDON WE USED TO GET ALL OUR PRODUCE FROM THE SOUTHWEST 
NOW I'VE GOT IT ON MY DOORSTEP IT'S BETTER THAN I COULD EVER IMAGINE 
IT'S FANTASTIC 
I JUST ABSOLUTELY ADORE WEST COUNTRY PRODUCE 
SO WITH A LARDER BURSTING WITH WHAT HE CONSIDERS TO BE THE BEST INGREDIENTS IN THE COUNTRY ELISHA 
IS OBVIOUSLY LOVING HIS NEW LIFE AMONGST WEST COUNTRY FOLK AND IS DELIGHTED TO FLY THE FLAG FOR THEM 
REPRESENTING THE SOUTHWEST IS LIKE SECOND TO NONE 
I COULDN'T THINK FOR A BETTER PLACE TO BE 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO YOURS I LOVE RABBIT I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC 
I RECKON YOU SHOULD GET ON IT THEN MATE YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO DO 
CHRIS CLEARLY WANTS TO PRESS ON BUT THEN HE IS A MAN FOLLOWING AN AMBITIOUS AGENDA 
CHRIS HORRIDGE JOINED THE R. A. F. BEFORE DECIDING HE REALLY WANTED TO BE A TOP CHEF 
TEN YEARS ON HE'S FINALLY ACHIEVED HIS DREAM AND HAS RETAINED 
A MICHELIN STAR AS HEAD CHEF AT THE PRESTIGIOUS BATH PRIORY HOTEL 
SO HE'S OBVIOUSLY HIGHLY TALENTED BUT HE'S NOT STOPPING THERE 
BECAUSE CHRIS IS ALSO DETERMINED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE ALL EAT 
AND TO ACHIEVE THIS HE'S INVENTED WHAT HE CALLS THREE DIMENSIONAL CUISINE 
THIS MEANS THAT NOT ONLY SHOULD YOUR FOOD LOOK AND TASTE GREAT 
BUT SHOULD ACTIVELY IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH AT THE SAME TIME 
IN MY FOOD WE'RE NOT USING SUGAR OR DAIRY AND WE ALSO KEEP GLUTEN TO A MINIMUM 
THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE NUTRITIONAL AREA I AM INTERESTED IN 
WE'RE PUSHING IT AS FAR AS WE CAN TO SEE CAN WE STILL PRODUCE 
GREAT LOOKING GREAT TASTING FOOD WITHOUT ALL THOSE ELEMENTS IN THERE 
HIS DINERS BENEFIT OF COURSE BUT HE IS TAKING THE IDEA WAY BEYOND HIS RESTAURANT 
I'VE FOUNDED A GROUP OF INTERESTED SCIENTIST PEOPLE A COLLABORATION OF 
EXPERTS WITH THE OVERALL GOAL OF DECREASING PATIENT RECOVERY TIMES 
YOU'LL BE OUT OF HOSPITAL A DAY OR TWO EARLY PURELY BECAUSE 
YOU HAVE BEEN EATING PROPERLY 
ONE OF HIS SCIENCE BOFFINS IS NUTRITIONIST TANYA PAGE 
AND HE CONSULTED HER WHEN HE WAS PLANNING HIS DISHES FOR GREAT BRITISH MENU 
I LIKE THE FACT YOU PUT BEETROOT IN THERE 
BEETROOT IS A REALLY GOOD LIVER TONIC RIGHT 
I THINK IT'S GOOD SOME REALLY GOOD FOODS THAT COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER 
SO WITH TANYA'S APPROVAL CHRIS CAN NOW PREPARE HIS PERFECTLY BALANCED MENU FOR THE JUDGES 
IF HIS IDEAS REALLY WORK IT COULD BE FANTASTIC NEWS FOR THE HEALTH OF THE NATION 
BUT IT NEEDS TO TASTE SENSATIONAL OR THE JUDGES MAY SIMPLY DISMISS IT BEFORE THEY REAP THE BENEFITS 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN ELISHA AND CHRIS ARE BUSY PREPARING THEIR INGREDIENTS 
CHRIS IS USING THE MEAT FROM THE RABBIT'S HIND LEGS TO STUFF THE SHOULDERS 
THE FIRST THING HE NEEDS TO DO IS VACUUM PACK THEM WITH SOME OF HIS 
OMEGA RICH FLAX OIL AND COOK THEM IN A WATER BATH 
WITH THAT JOB UNDER WAY HE CAN GET ON WITH MAKING HIS RED WINE JUS AND LET IT SLOWLY SIMMER 
THE FIRST THING ON ELISHA'S TO DO LIST ARE THE TOMATOES 
WHICH HE IS STUFFING WITH SMOKED AUBERGINE AND HOGGET SWEETBREADS 
AND TO SMOKE HIS AUBERGINE HE SIMPLY SPRAYS OIL ONTO A HOT SURFACE 
AND THEN LAYS A SHEET OF FOIL AND THE AUBERGINE ON TOP 
WHAT'S THAT 
SMOKING HAVE YOU JUST PUT OIL ON THE TOP THERE 
YEAH 
YOU'VE OPENED MY EYES I MUST ADMIT I'VE NEVER SEEN SMOKING DONE LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE 
CHRIS JUST CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT ELISHA'S DOING 
YOU JUST LEAVE THEM LIKE THAT NOW YEAH 
INTERESTING IT'S GOOD EH 
QUITE CLEARLY THERE'S NO WAY ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT AUBERGINE IS GONNA BE SMOKED 
POURING OIL ONTO A HOT SURFACE 
THESE STOVE TOPS ARE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DEGREES SO YOU'VE GOT 
ACRID SMOKE COMING OFF THERE WHICH IS NOT PARTICULARLY PLEASANT 
THAT'S WHY WE SMOKE WITH WOOD I'D BE VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW WHETHER IT ACTUALLY TASTES SMOKED 
I CAN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND FOR ME THE PROCESS OF SMOKING 
IN THE TRADITIONAL FORMAT WOULD BE TO SURROUND SOMETHING WITH SMOKE 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT GOING ON THERE IS JUST GOING STRAIGHT UP THE EXTRACTOR 
WHEN YOU TASTE IT IT WILL BE ABSOLUTELY LOVELY 
ELISHA MAY BE A HIGHLY TRAINED TOP CHEF BUT CHRIS THINKS HE'S STILL GOT A LOT TO LEARN 
I'M GONNA TEACH YOU HOW TO SMOKE AN AUBERGINE SO WHEN YOU BURN THAT YOU'VE GOT THIS AS PLAN B. O. K. 
GEE THANKS CHRIS THANKS 
HOLES THERE FOR THE SMOKE PENETRATION 
A BIT OF LO SALT ON THE TOP THERE 
IN YOUR SMOKER A BIT OF WOOD 
NOT THE FIRST SMOKE BECAUSE THE FIRST SMOKE IS VERY ACRID 
O. K. 
THAT 
FINISHED SMOKED AUBERGINE 
ELISHA OF COURSE KNOWS THE OLD FASHIONED METHOD AND THINKS IT'S 
TIME THAT CHRIS LEARNED WHAT HE SEES AS A MORE MODERN WAY OF DOING IT 
I'LL SHOW YOU 
YOU DON'T WANT AN INTENSE FLAVOUR OF SMOKING DO YOU 
O. K. 
THAT'S ACTUALLY SMOKED WITH SORT OF LIKE BURNING THOUGH ISN'T IT 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH USING NEW TECHNIQUES THAT'S WHY PEOPLE EVOLVE 
WHEN HE TASTES MINE HE'LL UNDERSTAND OH YEAH IT DOES TASTE A BIT SMOKY 
BUT CHRIS TRULY BELIEVES THAT HIS SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE GIVES HIM AN EDGE OVER HIS RIVAL 
SO TALK TO ME ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF AUBERGINE THEN ELISHA 
SORRY CHRIS I'M TRYING TO DO MY LAMB SORRY 
I'M NOT IN RIGHT NOW COME BACK TO ME LATER 
IT SEEMS ELISHA HAS HAD ENOUGH OF SCIENCE LESSONS 
BUT WITH THE HOGGET IN THE OVEN AND HIS AUBERGINES COOKED ELISHA RETURNS TO THE FRAY 
LOVELY THAT MATE DOES IT SMELL SMOKED 
IT DOES REMIND ME VAGUELY OF SMOKE 
IT REMINDS ME OF WHEN THE CHIMNEY WAS DONE AND ALL THAT SOOT COMES DOWN 
SO CHRIS DOESN'T WANT TO BE TAUGHT EITHER THEN 
ELISHA IS NOW FRYING THE SWEETBREADS TO GO WITH HIS AUBERGINE AND TOMATOES 
HE THEN CHOPS AND STIRS THE SWEETBREADS INTO THE SMOKED AUBERGINE 
LAYERS THE MIXTURE WITH TOMATOES AND POPS IT ALL INTO THE OVEN 
NOT MUCH FOR CHRIS TO COMMENT ON THERE 
THE RABBIT LEGS FOR THE STUFFING ARE NOW COOKED AND ONCE CHRIS 
HAS PICKED OFF THE MEAT HE MIXES IN SOME PINE NUTS MUSTARD OIL AND TARRAGON 
HE THEN SOWS THE STUFFING INTO THE RABBIT SHOULDERS AND GENTLY POACHES THE LOT 
ELISHA IS NOW READY TO MAKE HIS GARLIC PEARLED SPELT AND CHRIS'S 
UNRELENTING SCIENCE LESSONS MAY FINALLY HAVE WORN HIS RIVAL DOWN 
WITH ALL THIS INFORMATION THAT I WAS GETTING FROM YOU CHRIS I THOUGHT I HAD TO STEP UP MY GAME 
SO YOU WERE READING LAST NIGHT 
YEAH I WAS FINDING OUT ABOUT GARLIC 
IT'S GOOD FOR HEART DISEASE 
THAT'S RIGHT YOU ARE RIGHT ON THAT ONE 
SO WILL CHRIS APPROVE OF HIS PEARLED SPELT TOO 
ELISHA THINKS SO 
OH GREAT RIGHT HERE WE GO 
DON'T TELL ME THERE'S SOMETHING NUTRITIONAL 
YEAH OF COURSE CHRIS 
IT'S VERY HIGH IN VITAMIN E. 
FANTASTIC I'VE USED IT WITH RABBIT 
HAVE YOU YEAH IT COULD BE GREAT WITH YOUR RABBIT DISH 
PROBABLY WOULD BE I'LL SHOW YOU 
SO WHO'S THE HEALTH SCIENCE EVANGELIST NOW 
YEAH IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE FLOURY ISN'T IT 
IT IS 
WITH SPELT AND HOGGET ELISHA'S DISH HAS A DISTINCTLY PASTORAL FEEL ABOUT IT 
THAT'S NOT SURPRISING BECAUSE HE WAS SPOILT FOR CHOICE 
WHEN HE WAS CHOOSING HIS MENU FOR THE COMPETITION 
ELISHA LOVES TO COOK THE VERY BEST LOCAL PRODUCE SO IT'S RATHER HANDY WHEN YOUR RESTAURANT IS LINKED TO 
A LARGE ORGANIC ESTATE JUST A FEW MILES AWAY AT SHARPHAM PARK NEAR GLASTONBURY 
HIS BOSS ROGER SAUL HAD AGREED TO PROVIDE HIM WITH 
TWO OF HIS MAIN INGREDIENTS AND HAPPILY TOOK HIM ON A TOUR 
SO ELISHA ALTHOUGH THIS LOOKS LIKE GRASS THIS IS ACTUALLY SPELT IN ITS VERY EARLY STAGES 
IT'S AN ANCIENT CEREAL IT'S A COUSIN OF WHEAT 
IT PROBABLY GOES BACK SEVEN THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE 
CAME INTO EUROPE FROM THE MIDDLE EAST 
YOU CAN USE IT JUST AS YOU WOULD USE WHEAT BUT IT'S GOT A DIFFERENT 
GLUTEN STRUCTURE TO IT SO IT'S GREAT FOR PEOPLE WITH WHEAT INTOLERANCE BUT ALSO IT TASTES DELICIOUS 
IT'S GOT A LOVELY NUTTY FLAVOUR TO IT 
ONCE THE SPELT HAS BEEN HARVESTED IT'S TAKEN TO THE ESTATE'S MILL 
WHERE THE HUSKS AND BRAN ARE REMOVED 
WHEN WE BRING THE GRAIN IN HERE THE FIRST THING WE DO IS DE HUSK IT WHICH TAKES THE CHAFF OFF 
THE GRAIN THAT'S THEN LEFT THE FIRST PROCESS WE PUT IT THROUGH IS TO PEARL IT 
THAT'S I KNOW THE PRODUCT YOU LOVE 
YEAH THAT'S OUR PEARLED SPELT GRIND OFF THE OUTSIDE THE BRAN 
THAT LEAVES THE PEARLED SPELT INSIDE 
THAT CAN THEN GO TO MAKE ANYTHING FROM A RISOTTO USING IT IN A STEW A SALAD 
SO WHO'S THE CHEF HERE 
RIGHT ELISHA THIS IS IT THE PEARLED SPELT COMING THROUGH THE SYSTEM 
I THINK SOME GREAT FLAVOURS ARE GONNA HAPPEN WITH THIS 
THE SPELT IS ALSO USED IN ANIMAL FEED HERE 
SO IT'S BACK OUTSIDE FOR THE NEXT STOP ON ELISHA'S GRAND TOUR 
O. K. SO WE'VE GOT TWO TYPES OF SHEEP HERE THE MANX LOGHTAN WHICH IS THE 
BEIGE ANIMAL AND THE HEBRIDEAN WHICH IS THE CHOCOLATY BLACK COLOUR 
WE GROW THOSE OUT AS HOGGETS SO THAT'S A TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTH ANIMAL 
AS OPPOSED TO LAMB WHICH IS UP TO TWELVE MONTHS AND MUTTON WHICH IS OVER TWENTY FOUR MONTHS 
WE ALSO FEED THEM ON THE SPELT A MIX OF SPELT AND BEANS WHICH IS WHAT YOU SEE HERE 
SO VERY HIGH PROTEIN VERY HIGH ENERGY AND IT GIVES A REALLY GOOD FAT CONTENT IN THE MEAT SO 
AGAIN YOU GET THAT MARBLING WHICH YOU'D NORMALLY ONLY EXPECT TO GET IN BEEF AND YOU GET IT IN THE HOGGET 
BY USING BOTH THE ESTATE'S HOME GROWN HOGGET 
AND ITS ORGANIC SPELT IN ONE DISH 
ELISHA KNEW THAT NO ONE COULD ACCUSE HIM OF NOT USING REGIONAL PRODUCE 
STILL TO COME ELISHA RACES TO FINISH IN TIME 
AND CHRIS STRUGGLES THROUGH THE TASTING 
BACK IN THE KITCHEN ELISHA'S SPELT HAS COOKED AND HE'S BLITZED THE GARLIC WITH SOME CREAM 
HE THEN SIMPLY MIXES IT ALL TOGETHER AND FINISHES OFF THE GARLICKY SPELT WITH A DROP OF HONEY JOB DONE 
SO ELISHA HAS DECIDED TO COOK HOGGET WHICH HAS A MILDER TASTE 
THAN MUTTON AND IS NOT ONLY SERVING IT AS A CUTLET AND TERRINE BUT ALSO 
BRAISING AND FRYING THE TONGUE AS WELL AS MIXING THE SWEETBREADS WITH SMOKED AUBERGINE AND TOMATO 
FINALLY HE'S DRESSING IT ALL WITH BROAD BEAN AND PEA PUREE AND THE GARLIC PEARLED SPELT 
IT'S A FANTASTIC DISH I'M REALLY PROUD OF WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO 
IT IS MODERN 
BUT CHRIS ISN'T SO SURE 
THERE'S ONE HUNDRED INGREDIENTS GOING ON THE PLATE AGAIN 
THERE'S TONGUE AND SWEETBREADS AND THE HOGGET 
IS NINETY FIVE INGREDIENTS ON THE PLATE THE FUTURE OF BRITISH FOOD I DON'T KNOW 
WELL CHRIS'S IDEA OF THE FUTURE INCLUDES WILD RABBIT 
AND LIKE ELISHA HE'S USING DIFFERENT CUTS 
HE'S STUFFING THE SHOULDER WITH MEAT FROM THE LEGS FIRST 
THEN FRYING THE LOIN RACK AND FINALLY THE KIDNEYS 
HE'S SERVING IT ALL WITH CARROT PUREE ASPARAGUS COURGETTES 
WATERCRESS AND BOTH PEA AND CORIANDER MICRO HERBS 
THE TWO CHEFS CERTAINLY HAVE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES 
LOCAL SEASONAL AND GOOD FOR YOU 
WHAT ABOUT THE FUN WHAT ABOUT THE ENJOYMENT 
WHAT ABOUT JUST GOING AND HAVING A GOOD TIME 
WELL FOR NOW CHRIS IS TOO BUSY MAKING HIS CARROT PUREE 
HE'S MIXING HIS CHOPPED CARROT WITH BOTH CARROT AND ORANGE JUICE AND POACHING IT BEFORE BLITZING 
WITH THE PUREE DONE HE CAN PREP THE REST OF HIS SUMMER VEGETABLES 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE WATERCRESS HERE 
VERY HIGH IN IRON 
YOU'VE GOT CORIANDER HERE WHICH IS VERY VERY GOOD FOR CHELATION OF HEAVY METALS SO IT'S ACTUALLY 
USED FOR CHRONIC FATIGUE PATIENTS QUITE A LOT BECAUSE IT HELPS TO REMOVE HEAVY METAL FROM THE BODY 
DO YOU THINK ELISHA'S GETTING THAT BUT FOR CHRIS EVERY SINGLE INGREDIENT ON THE PLATE HAD TO BE 
CAREFULLY RESEARCHED AND SOURCED BEFOREHAND AND THAT RULE EVEN INCLUDED THE TINY CORIANDER SHOOTS 
HIS QUEST TO LEARN MORE ABOUT CORIANDER 
LED HIM TO THE ORGANIC HERB TRADING COMPANY IN MILVERTON IN SOMERSET 
THEY'VE BEEN GROWING AND DISTRIBUTING OVER TWO HUNDRED HERBS 
SPICES AND FLOWERS HERE FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS 
HI CHRIS HI SHELLEY 
MANAGING DIRECTOR SHELLEY MCIVOR SHOWED HIM AROUND 
WE GROW CORIANDER HERE AND WE ALSO IMPORT FROM EGYPT 
O. K. I'M INTERESTED I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF CORIANDER 
WELL THERE'S REFERENCES TO IT AS FAR BACK AS FIVE THOUSAND B. C. O. K. 
CORIANDER SEEDS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN EGYPTIAN TOMBS AND IT WAS USED BY THE GREEKS AS AN APHRODISIAC 
AN APHRODISIAC THAT IS INTERESTING 
BUT HE WASN'T THERE TO LEARN ABOUT THAT 
HERBS AND PLANTS PRODUCED ON THE FARM ARE GROUND UP TO USE IN MEDICINES OILS TEAS AND TINCTURES 
WE'VE GOT SOME CORIANDER SEED HERE WHICH WE'RE GOING TO POWDER 
IF YOU'RE DOING DIFFERENT SPICES AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE YEAR 
SURELY THROUGHOUT THE DAY YOU CAN COME IN HERE AND SMELL CUMIN ONE MINUTE CORIANDER THE NEXT 
THE AROMA MUST BE FANTASTIC IT IS 
I'D WANT MY OFFICE TO BE IN HERE SO YOU COULD SMELL EVERYTHING 
IT GETS THROUGH INTO THE OFFICES ACTUALLY 
YOU CAN TELL COS THE MOODS CHANGE AS WE'RE MAKING DIFFERENT BLENDS RIGHT 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK O. K. 
IT'S GOT A REALLY UNIQUE AROMA 
IT'S VERY POWERFUL 
PEPPERY AND WOODY ALMOST LIKE A CITRUS FLAVOUR YEAH 
BUT CHRIS REALLY WANTED SOME INTENSELY FLAVOURED FRESH CORIANDER 
SO HE DECIDED TO CALL ON THE MASTER OF MICRO HERBS HIMSELF 
HI CHRIS HI RICH 
RICHARD VINE AT BABY SALADS AND AMP VEG IN WESTBURY IS A LEGEND IN THE CULINARY WORLD 
HERE HE PAINSTAKINGLY GROWS OVER FIFTY DIFFERENT MICRO HERBS AND GREENS 
FOR THE U. K.'S TOP CHEFS AND RESTAURANTS 
HOPEFULLY THAT'S SORT OF THE RIGHT SIZE THAT YOU WANT THAT'S LOVELY 
THAT'S PERFECT THAT PIECE THERE FOR PRESENTATION THAT'D BE STUNNING 
MICRO HERBS DON'T GROW MUCH MORE THAN TEN CENTIMETRES HIGH BUT 
DESPITE THEIR DIMINUTIVE SIZE THEY'RE PRETTY STRONG STUFF 
WHEN THE SEED IS SOWN ALL THE NUTRITION IS ENCAPSULATED IN THAT SEED 
AND THE MOMENT GERMINATION STARTS THAT'S WHERE THE FLAVOUR IS 
IF YOU TASTE ONE IT'S ABSOLUTELY POWER PACKED WITH FLAVOUR 
THIS IS FANTASTIC THAT'S GREAT I FORGOT HOW GOOD IT WAS 
IT DOES PACK A PUNCH DOESN'T IT MY WORD 
WHICH CONFIRMED THAT CORIANDER SHOOTS WERE EXACTLY WHAT CHRIS WAS LOOKING FOR 
BACK IN OUR KITCHEN ELISHA IS RAPIDLY RUNNING OUT OF TIME 
HE NEEDS TO PUT HIS TERRINE TOGETHER AND HAVE IT CHILLED BEFORE HE CAN SERVE IT SO HE QUICKLY SHREDS THE 
SHOULDER MEAT LAYERS IT WITH CABBAGE AND ONION AND GETS IT INTO THE FRIDGE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE 
HE THEN HASTILY BEGINS PREPPING THE HOGGET RACK BUT CHRIS FEELS LIKE HAVING A LEISURELY CHAT 
SO WHAT DOES THE COMPETITION MEAN TO YOU ELISHA 
OBVIOUSLY TO REPRESENT THE SOUTHWEST WOULD BE A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT 
THIS PARTICULAR ROUND IS ABOUT TAKING BRITISH CUISINE FORWARD 
THAT'S HOPEFULLY WHAT'S COMING ACROSS 
ELISHA'S NOT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION 
HE'S FAR TOO BUSY SEALING THE RACK BEFORE PUTTING IT IN THE OVEN TO ROAST 
ACROSS THE KITCHEN CHRIS IS WAY AHEAD 
THE STUFFED SHOULDER IS NOW READY TO BE PAN ROASTED AS WELL AS THE LOIN RACK AND FINALLY THE KIDNEYS 
WHILE CHRIS IS NEARLY DONE ELISHA STILL HAS THE HOGGET TONGUE 
TO DUST AND DEEP FRY WHICH CHRIS CLEARLY DISAPPROVES OF 
ELISHA IS TOO BUSY TO NOTICE 
HE'S REALLY UP AGAINST IT NOW AND GETS HIS SOUS CHEF TO HELP MAKE HIS BROAD BEAN AND PEA PUREE 
BUT THEN CHRIS SAYS THE WORDS ELISHA HAS BEEN DREADING 
NEARLY READY ELISHA YEAH FANTASTIC 
HE DOESN'T LOOK NEARLY READY 
CHRIS IS KEEN ON MODERN PRESENTATION AND IS SERVING HIS RABBIT ON A MOTTLED WHITE MARBLE TILE 
FIRST ON IS SOME OF THE RED WINE JUS AND CARROT PUREE VERY CHEFFY 
THEN A SCATTERING OF SUMMER VEGETABLES FOLLOWED BY THE 
STUFFED SHOULDER OF RABBIT LOIN RIB CAGE AND FINALLY THE KIDNEYS 
IN TYPICAL CHRIS STYLE HE DRESSES THE PLATE WITH A 
SCATTERING OF MICRO HERBS INCLUDING THE CORIANDER SHOOTS AND FLOWERS 
FINALLY MORE RED WINE GRAVY GOES INTO NATTY COPPER PANS ON THE SIDE 
ACROSS THE COUNTER ELISHA CAN'T DELAY ANY LONGER AND HAS ALSO BEGUN PLATING UP 
FIRST THE GARLIC SPELT AND THEN THE BROAD BEAN AND PEA PUREE 
THE TERRINE ISN'T FULLY CHILLED BUT IT'S HOLDING TOGETHER PERFECTLY 
HE THEN CAREFULLY ADDS THE STUFFED TOMATOES THE FRIED TONGUE 
AND THEN THE ROAST RACK 
FINALLY HE TAKES A LEAF OUT OF CHRIS'S BOOK AND SCATTERS FLOWERS AROUND THE PLATE 
THAT WAS A BIT OF A PUSH 
SO HERE ARE THE SOUTHWEST'S ENTRIES FOR THE MAIN COURSE 
CHRIS'S WILD RABBIT WITH SUMMER VEGETABLES AND HERBS 
AND ELISHA'S HOGGET WITH GARLIC PEARLED SPELT AND BROAD BEAN AND PEA PUREE 
IT'S TIME FOR THE ALL IMPORTANT TASTING 
CHRIS'S RABBIT IS GOING FIRST AND WHILE HE TASTES HIS OWN DISH IN THE KITCHEN ELISHA TAKES HIS PLATE 
INTO A SEPARATE ROOM WHERE HE CAN SAY WHAT HE REALLY THINKS ABOUT HIS RIVAL'S MAIN COURSE 
CHRIS'S THREE DIMENSIONAL CUISINE ALWAYS BEGINS WITH PRESENTATION 
I LIKED THE TILE ON THE FIRST COURSE THAT WAS NICE BUT I'M NOT OVERLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS TILE HERE 
FAIR ENOUGH BUT I'M SURE CHRIS HAD A REASON 
THE PLATE FOR ME PLAYS A BIG PART IT'S AN EXTENSION OF MY PERSONALITY 
WELL I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF THAT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE TASTE 
IT'S A REALLY INTENSE FLAVOUR OF CARROT THAT IS VERY NICE 
SO A GOOD START BUT NOW ELISHA IS A BIT FLUMMOXED 
I'VE BEEN GIVEN A PAN AND I'M NOT SURE WHERE TO PUT IT 
I LIKE TO GIVE A SAUCE BOAT SO YOU CAN DIP YOUR VEG IN THERE 
IF YOU WANT TO GET IT IN THERE TASTE THE SAUCE 
OBVIOUSLY IF THEY POUR IT ALL OVER THE PLATE IT'S GONNA GO ALL OVER THE PLACE 
BUT DOES IT ADD ANYTHING 
THE SAUCE JUST TASTES QUITE SHARP FOR THE ACTUAL RABBIT 
I DON'T THINK THE SAUCE DOES THE WILD RABBIT ANY JUSTICE 
SO THE RABBIT ITSELF IS GOOD 
IT'S A BIT CHEWY VERY CHEWY 
IF I CHEW ANY MORE I MIGHT NEED FALSE TEETH 
THAT'S NOT GOOD 
BUT DOES HE LIKE THE VEGETABLES AND HERBS 
YOU JUST GET LOADS OF SALAD REALLY 
IT INTERRUPTS WITH THE TASTING OF THE VEGETABLES 
THERE'S NO WAY CHRIS WILL AGREE WITH THAT 
I THINK THE HERBS ARE GREAT AMAZING FLAVOUR ON THEM 
OBVIOUSLY ALL THOSE ARE PACKED WITH ANTI OXIDANTS 
AH OF COURSE THE THIRD ELEMENT OF CHRIS'S LAW IS NUTRITION 
I LISTENED TO WHAT HE WAS SAYING ABOUT THE CARROT GOING WELL WITH THE RABBIT 
AND IT'S NOTHING MORE EXCITING IT'S CARROTS AND RABBIT 
I CAN'T SEE NOTHING MODERN IN THAT 
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT WHAT HE'S SAYING ABOUT MY FOOD 
FOR ME THIS DISH TICKS ALL THE BOXES OF MODERN BRITISH 
CUISINE AND WILL PLAY A PART IN THE FUTURE OF FOOD IN THE U. K. I'M SURE 
SO NO AGREEMENT THERE BUT NOW IT'S CHRIS'S TURN TO TASTE ELISHA'S HOGGET 
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT LOOKS LIKE SUMMER TO ME 
DO YOU REALLY HAVE BRAISED MEAT IN SUMMERTIME 
BUT ELISHA STRONGLY DISAGREES 
IT REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF SUMMER LOOK THE GREEN THERE THEN YOU'VE 
GOT THE RED OF THE TOMATOES AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE FLOWERY SHOOTS 
SO HOW ABOUT THE MAIN ELEMENT THE HOGGET 
THIS IS ACTUALLY A PIECE OF RAW MEAT LOOKING AT THIS 
IT'S QUITE CLEARLY COMPLETELY RAW 
THAT'S NOT SLOW COOKED THAT'S JUST COMPLETELY RAW 
OH DEAR UNDER PRESSURE OF TIME ELISHA SEEMS TO HAVE 
PUSHED THE WRONG BUTTON ON THE OVEN AND THE HOGGET ISN'T ROASTED AT ALL 
BOTH HE AND THE MEAT HAVE BEEN LEFT FEELING RATHER RAW 
CHECK THAT OVEN I DIDN'T REALISE THAT THE OVEN WAS STEAMING 
I FEEL SO UPSET THAT I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TASTE IT 
BOTH CHEFS PUSH THE MEAT TO ONE SIDE AND CHRIS MOVES ON TO TRY THE 
SWEETBREADS AND THE MUCH DEBATED AUBERGINE 
WHERE'S THE SMOKE 
THERE IS NO SMOKE IN THAT 
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE HE DOESN'T LIKE TOO 
SWEETBREADS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE MEATS ACTUALLY AND WE'VE BURIED 
IT WITH A LOAD OF TOMATO AND AUBERGINE THAT'S BEEN BURNED 
WHY HAVE YOU DONE THAT AND THE HOGGET AND CABBAGE TERRINE 
THE TERRINE IS FULL OF CARTILAGE 
I'M NOT INTO THAT SO HOW'S ELISHA GETTING ON 
THE GARLIC PUREE 
THAT'S A WINNER A PERFECT WINNER 
DOES CHRIS LIKE THAT AT LEAST 
IT'S NOT VERY SUBTLE IT'S QUITE IN YOUR FACE 
IF THIS IS THE FUTURE OF FOOD THEN MAYBE I'LL GO AWAY AND BECOME AN ARTIST 
THAT'S A BIT EXTREME BUT HOW'S ELISHA FEELING AFTER HIS SLIP UP 
TODAY HAS BEEN VERY VERY EVENTFUL BUT THE GOOD THING IS 
WE'VE LULLED CHRIS INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY 
WE MADE HIM THINK HIS IS BETTER 
ON JUDGEMENT DAY WE'LL GET THE WHOLE THING ALL RIGHT READY TO GO 
WELL WE'LL SEE WHETHER ELISHA DOES GET IT ALL RIGHT 
AND WHAT THE JUDGES HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THESE DISHES ON FRIDAY 
TOMORROW IT'S THE FINAL ROUND BEFORE JUDGEMENT DAY 
AND THE TWO RIVALS FIGHT IT OUT OVER THE DESSERT COURSE 
SO THAT'S THE WINNING INGREDIENT 
IT'S PUTTING THE MAGIC INTO THE DISH IS IT 
THE COMPETITION CONTINUES TO BE FULL OF SURPRISES TOMORROW ON GREAT BRITISH MENU
