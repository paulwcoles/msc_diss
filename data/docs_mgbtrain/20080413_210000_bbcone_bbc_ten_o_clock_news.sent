IF NECESSARY MUCH THE HEADS OF 
STATE MET THIS WEEKEND IN ZAMBIA TO 
DISCUSS THE CRISIS 
THAT THEY CAME HERE AT ALL IS A 
SIGN OF ONE THING THAT ZIMBABWE'S 
CRISIS IS NOW THEIRS TOO IT IS IT 
IS DRAG THE ENTIRE SOUTHERN AFRICAN 
REGION IN DOWN WARD SPIRAL THE 
M. D. C. CAME WITH HIGH HOPES THAT THESE 
HEADS OF STATE WOULD TELL ROBERT 
MUGABE TO GO BUT THEY FELL FAR 
SHORT OF THAT INSTEAD THEY TOLD 
THE OPPOSITION THAT THEY SHOULD 
RESPECT THE ELECTION RESULT WHEN IT 
IS ANNOUNCED AND GO INTO A SECOND 
ROUND RUN OFF AGAINST MUGABE IF

SIGHT FOR TWO WEEKS NOW THEY SAY 
NO UNCORRUPTED RESULT FROM THE 
FIRST ROUND IS POSSIBLE THE BALLOT 
PAPERS THEY SAY HAVE BEEN COOKED 
OUT OF SIGHT OF INDEPENDENT 
MONITORS 
IT IS NOT LEGAL FOR THE MONITORS SIMPLE REASON THAT ZANU P. F. HAVE 
ALREADY STUFFED THE BALLOT BOXES

BALLOT BOXES FOR THE PAST TWELVE DAYS 
THE THIRTEEN HEADS OF STATE MADE FEW 
CONCRETE DEMANDS ON MR. MUGABE

THE OPPOSITION M. D. C. THEY SHOULD IF 
NECESSARY NOW GO INTO A SECOND

SIX DAYS AGO HE WENT MISSING THIS 
C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE AT AT QUEEN'S PARK WAS 
ONE OF THE LAST SIGHTINGS JUST 
BEFORE HE BOARDED A TUBE TRAIN 
HEADING TOWARDS CENTRAL LONDON BUT

AFTER THAT FINAL SIGHTING HIS BODY 
WAS DISCOVERED HERE IN WHAT POLICE 
DESCRIBED AS A REMOTE PART OF 
PADDINGTON STATION NO WORD HAS 
BEEN GIVEN AS TO HOW HE DIED ALL 
THEY HAVE SAID SO FAR IS THAT HE 
WASN'T HIT BY A TRAIN BUT GIVEN 
THE WAY HE HAD DISAPPEARED FRIENDS 
AND FAMILY HAD BEGUN TO FEAR THE 
WORST 
THIS IS THE NEWS I HAVE BEEN WORST DREADING FOR THE BEST PART OF A 
WEEK WHEN HIS MOBILE PHONES WENT 
DEAD AND NOBODY COULD CONTACT HIM 
HE WASN'T EVEN CONTACTING HIS MUM 
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THIS MAN NEEDS 
TO BE FOUND QUICK THE POLICE NEED

HIS AGENT TONIGHT SAID ALL THOSE 
AROUND HIM WERE DEVASTATED AT THE 
LOSS OF MAN WHO WAS CARING COMPASSIONATE AND GIFTED 
TWO SENIOR INTERNATIONAL FIGURES 
HAVE GIVEN BLEAK WARNINGS ON THE 
OUTCOME OF THE RISING COST OF FOOD 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK HAS 
SAID IT COULD PUSH ONE HUNDRED MILLION 
PEOPLE FURTHER INTO POVERTY AND THE 
HEAD OF THE I. M. F. SAID HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WILL FACE 
STARVATION IF FOOD PRICES KEEP 
RISING BOTH ARE CALLING ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO TAKE 
IMMEDIATE ACTION TO DEAL WITH 
RISING PRICES 
THE WORLD IS ALREADY WITNESSING 
SERIOUS UNREST OVER ROCKETING FOOD 
PRICES DEMONSTRATORS TOOK TO THE 
STREETS OF HAITI THIS WEEK FOUR 
PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN PROTESTS AT 
PRICES THAT HAVE SOARED FIFTY PER CENT THE 
PRIME MINISTER WAS FORCED TO STEP 
DOWN THESE WERE THE SCENES IN 
RECENT DAYS IN EGYPT PRICES ARE 
RISING AT SUCH TERRIFYING SPEED 
THERE ARE FEARS IT COULD THREATEN 
GLOBAL SECURITY 
HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WILL BE 
STARVING CHILDREN WILL SUFFER FROM 
MALNUTRITION WITH CONSEQUENCES 
ALL THEIR LIFE MOREOVER THE 
CONSEQUENCES WILL BE SUCH THAT 
DISRUPTION MAYO CUR IN THE ECONOMIC 
ENVIRONMENT 
THE WORLD BANK'S ENVIRONMENT MEETING FOCUSES ON AN INTERNATIONAL 
PLAN TO REDUCE HUNGER AND CURB THE 
UNREST BASICS LIKE WHEAT RICE AND 
COOKING OIL ARE SO EXPENSIVE THEY 
HAVE LEFT MILLIONS FACING THE 
PROSPECT OF STARVATION SO WHAT'S 
TRIGGERED THIS MASSIVE RISE IN 
PRICES PRICES THE WORLD'S POPULATION IS GROWING 
WITH MORE MOUTHS TO FEED THERE'S 
MORE PRESSURE ON LAND WATER AND 
OIL THEN THERE ARE ENVIRONMENTAL 
PRESSURES AND THE IMPACT OF A 
SERIES OF POOR HARVESTS ACROSS THE 
GLOBE THE PRODUCTION OF BIOFUELS 
AS AN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY HAS 
DIVERTED FOOD PRODUCTION ALL 
CONTRIBUTING TO A SQUEEZE ON FOOD 
SUPPLIES 
POOR COUNTRIES NEED TO SUPPLIES INVEST HEAVILY IN AGRICULTURE TO 
FEED THEIR PEOPLE THERE'S BEEN A 
DEARTH OF INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE 
IN POOR COUNTRIES BECAUSE OF I. M. F. 
AND WORLD BANK POLICIES ALSO 
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT THE 
WEST U. S. E. U. MUST STOP THIS DASH 
FOR BIOFUELS THAT'S PUTTING UP THE 
PRICES 
WITH GOVERNMENTS ALREADY PRICES FORCED TO STOCKPILE SUPPLIES THE 
WORLD FACES A CHALLENGE OF AVERTING
