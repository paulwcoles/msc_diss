REINDEER 
CREATURES OF THE ICE AGE 
AT HOME IN FREEZING TEMPERATURES ICE AND SNOW 
EVERY YEAR THEY MAKE A SPECTACULAR MIGRATION 
AND FOR CENTURIES THEY'VE BEEN JOINED ON THESE EPIC TREKS BY THE SAMI 
THE SAMI ARE REINDEER HERDERS OF EUROPE'S FAR NORTH 
ONE OF THE CONTINENT'S LAST NOMADIC PEOPLES 
AN ANCIENT AND DEMANDING WAY OF LIFE 
THAT STILL SURVIVES IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
BUT MODERN SAMI HAVE MORE CHOICE THAN ANY GENERATION BEFORE 
THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF OSLO MUST SEEM TEMPTING 
COMPARED TO THIS WILDERNESS OF ICE AND SNOW 
ELLE SIRI AND INGA TRIUMF ARE TWO TEENAGERS 
ABOUT TO EMBARK ON A DIFFICULT JOURNEY 
THEY WILL SOON HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER THE REWARDS OF SAMI LIFE 
OUTWEIGH THE HARDSHIPS 
AND WHETHER THEY'LL BECOME THE NEXT GENERATION OF REINDEER HERDERS 
FEBRUARY IN ARCTIC NORWAY 
THE DAYS ARE SHORT AND IT'S THIRTY DEGREES BELOW ZERO 
THIS TIME OF YEAR 
EVERY SAMI FAMILY MUST ROUND UP THEIR REINDEER 
AND DRIVE THEM INTO A CORRAL 
IT'S A HEALTH CHECK TO SORT OUT THOSE NOT FIT ENOUGH 
TO MAKE THE LONG MIGRATION LATER IN SPRING 
OLD AND WORN TEETH 
MEANS THE REINDEER WILL BE SOLD FOR SLAUGHTER FOR MEAT AND HIDE 
THE PROFIT FROM REINDEER HERDING 
NO THE TEETH WAS GOOD 
GOOD TEETH MEAN A RESPITE AT LEAST UNTIL NEXT YEAR 
GOOD TEETH 
WON'T SELL THIS REINDEER 
THIS IS MAY TORILL ELLE'S MOTHER AND INGA'S AUNT 
SHE LIVES THE SAMI LIFE WITH PASSIONATE ENTHUSIASM 
ELLE AND INGA HAVE GROWN UP ABSORBING THIS PASSION FOR THE ARCTIC 
AND FOR THESE HARDY RESILIENT REINDEER 
THIS FAR NORTH 
IT'S TOO COLD AND TOO TOUGH FOR COWS OR SHEEP 
ONLY A CREATURE THAT EVOLVED DURING THE ICE AGE 
CAN REALLY BE AT HOME IN THESE HARSH LANDSCAPES 
BUT REINDEER ARE MORE THAN JUST ARCTIC FARM ANIMALS 
TO SURVIVE HERE THEY NEED THEIR WILD INSTINCTS 
FOR THIS PARTNERSHIP TO WORK 
THE SAMI HAVE HAD TO ADAPT TO THE REINDEER'S WAY OF LIFE 
AS MUCH AS THE REINDEER HAVE ADAPTED TO THE SAMI 
IN THE PAST THE SAMI USED REINDEER FOR EVERYTHING 
FROM FOOD AND CLOTHING TO TRANSPORT AND MONEY 
THEY WERE NOMADS FOLLOWING THEIR HERDS 
LIVING IN REINDEER SKIN TENTS CALLED LAVVUS 
REINDEER ARE STILL AT THE HEART OF SAMI LIFE 
THOUGH THE SAMI HAVE MOVED WITH THE TIMES 
MAY TORILL'S FAMILY LIVE IN KAUTOKEINO 
A MODERN SAMI TOWN IN ARCTIC NORWAY 
BUT MANY PEOPLE STILL THINK OF THE SAMI AS LOCKED IN THE PAST 
WE JOKE WITH THEM THAT WE DON'T HAVE CARS 
AND THAT WE DRIVE ONLY WITH REINDEERS 
BUT WE ARE JUST NORMAL PEOPLE 
NOT SO NORMAL 
O. K. NOT SO NORMAL BUT WE ARE STILL NORMAL 
ONE ASPECT OF THEIR LIFE IS FAR FROM NORMAL 
EVERY SPRING ELLE'S FAMILY LEAVES KAUTOKEINO 
AND TRAVELS WITH THEIR HERD 
ON ONE OF THE LONGEST MIGRATIONS STILL MADE BY ANY SAMI FAMILY 
A JOURNEY OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY KILOMETRES THROUGH AN ICE BOUND MOUNTAIN WILDERNESS 
TO AN ISLAND OFF NORWAY'S SPECTACULAR ARCTIC COAST 
THIS DIFFICULT JOURNEY IS NEVER WITHOUT PROBLEMS 
THOUGH THEY HAVE NO IDEA JUST WHAT THEY'LL FACE THIS YEAR 
AS THEY PREPARE FOR THEIR LONG TREK 
WE ARE TAKING THINGS THAT WE ARE GOING TO USE 
WHEN WE ARE GOING TO THE MIGRATION 
SHE'S HELPING ME 
THIS IS MY GRANDMOTHER 
ELLE'S GRANDMOTHER BERIT 
HAS DONE THIS MIGRATION MORE TIMES THAN SHE CARES TO REMEMBER 
AND IN TRUE SAMI TRADITION 
SHE'S PASSING ON HER EXPERIENCE TO ELLE AND INGA 
REINDEER ARE BETTER ADAPTED THAN THE SAMI TO MAKE THESE JOURNEYS 
THEIR LARGE HOOVES ARE SPLAYED AND CUP SHAPED 
TO HELP THEM WALK ON SNOW OR ICE 
HOOVES THAT ALSO MAKE SCOOPS TO DIG THROUGH THE SNOW TO BURIED LICHENS 
THEIR MEAGRE STAPLE DIET IN WINTER 
AND THEY'RE PERFECTLY HAPPY IN SUB ZERO TEMPERATURES 
THE HAIRS ON THEIR COATS ARE HOLLOW AND FILLED WITH AIR 
VERY EFFECTIVE INSULATION BOTH FOR REINDEER AND SAM I. 
THIS IS MY MUM GOING TO WEAR WHEN WE ARE ON THE MIGRATION 
IT'S VERY GOOD WHEN IT'S COLD OUTSIDE 
THIS IS REINDEER SKIN 
IT'S VERY WARM AND MUCH BETTER THAN THIS KIND OF CLOTHES 
THIS IS WHAT WE USE INTO THE SHOES SO IT'S WARM 
EVERY PART OF A REINDEER HAS A DIFFERENT USE 
THIS IS FROM THE REIN HEAD REINDEER'S HEAD 
THIS IS WHAT WE USE UNDER THE SHOES 
IT'S VERY HARD WHEN YOU WALK WITH THEM 
IT'S NOT SO EASY TO DESTROY OR MAKE HOLES IN IT 
WE TAKE THIS WITH US 
THEY'RE ITS EYES 
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE AT HOME IN THIS EXTREME CLIMATE 
WINTER IS STILL A HARD TIME FOR REINDEER 
LONG BEFORE SPRING THEY'VE EATEN ALL THE LICHENS THEY CAN FIND 
WHICH IS ONE REASON THEY HAVE TO MIGRATE TO DISTANT SUMMER GROUNDS 
AND THE FEMALES ARE NOW HEAVILY PREGNANT 
THIS WOULD BE A DESPERATE TIME FOR THEM WITHOUT SAMI HELP 
A REAL ADVANTAGE OF REINDEER AND SAMI SHARING THEIR LIVES 
TIMING THE MIGRATION IS EVERYTHING 
LEAVE TOO EARLY AND THE MOUNTAINS COULD STILL BE IMPASSABLE 
TOO LATE AND THE COWS MIGHT DROP THEIR CALVES BEFORE THEY REACH THE ISLAND 
BUT EXACTLY WHEN THEY START ISN'T UP TO THE FAMILY 
THE REINDEER MADE THEIR ANNUAL TREKS LONG BEFORE THE SAMI JOINED THEM 
THE FEMALES KNOW THEY MUST REACH THE SUMMER GROUNDS BEFORE CALVING 
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT 
THE REINDEER HEAD FOR THE COAST AND THE FAMILY FOLLOWS 
UNDERSTANDING THE REINDEER'S NATURAL ABILITIES IS CRUCIAL TO THE SAMI 
IT CAN BE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH IN THE UNPREDICTABLE ARCTIC 
I REMEMBER ONE YEAR WE WAS ON THE MIGRATION 
AND THEN IT BECOME A TERRIBLE WEATHER 
IT WAS SO BAD YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING 
BUT WE KNEW THAT IF WE FOLLOW THE REINDEERS 
THEN WE ARE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
WHEN THE FAMILY EMERGED FROM THAT BLIZZARD 
THE REINDEER'S UNERRING SENSE OF DIRECTION 
HAD LED THEM SAFELY THROUGH THE STORM 
WHAT WILL THIS YEAR'S JOURNEY BE LIKE 
THREE GENERATIONS OF ELLE'S FAMILY WORK TOGETHER 
TO SHEPHERD THIS VAST HERD OF THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS 
SAFELY OVER THE MOUNTAINS 
THIS PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN SAMI AND REINDEER IS AN ANCIENT ONE 
EIGHT THOUSAND YEAR OLD ROCK CARVINGS 
SHOW THE ANCESTORS OF THE SAMI HUNTING WILD REINDEER 
BUT OVER TIME THEY LEARNED TO EXPLOIT THE REINDEER'S INSTINCTS 
AND TO CONTROL THE HERDS 
SNOWMOBILES ARE ONE PART OF THE MODERN WORLD THAT THE SAMI LEAPT ON 
IN THE PAST ALL THEY HAD WERE SKIS AND MUSCLE POWER 
CONTROLLING THE HERD IS NOW MUCH EASIER 
THE MALES DON'T SHARE THE SAME URGENCY TO MIGRATE AS THE PREGNANT COWS 
SO ELLE AND INGA MAKE SURE THAT NONE FALL BEHIND 
EVEN WITH THE LUXURY OF SNOWMOBILES THIS IS A TOUGH JOB 
BY APRIL THE DARKNESS OF WINTER 
HAS GIVEN WAY TO NEARLY CONTINUOUS DAYLIGHT 
LONG DAYS IN THE COLD AND WIND 
AND BEFORE THE GIRLS CAN REST THEY HAVE TO SET UP CAMP 
ON MIGRATION THEY STILL LIVE IN LAVVUS 
BUT NOW THEY'RE MADE OF STEEL AND CANVAS AND MUCH EASIER TO PUT UP 
IT TAKES JUST A FEW MINUTES TO BUILD A SHELTER 
FROM THE RELENTLESS ARCTIC WIND 
AND THE SNOW HERE IS SOFT ENOUGH 
FOR THE REINDEER TO DIG FOR LICHENS TO EAT BEFORE THEY REST 
SINGING IS AS MUCH A PART OF SAMI LIFE AS REINDEER 
THESE SONGS ARE CALLED JOIKS SONGS THAT EXPRESS THE JOY OF SAMI LIFE 
WHEN YOU JOIK IT'S TO SOMEONE OR TO A MOUNTAIN 
YOU JOIK A MOUNTAIN 
PEOPLES AND TO DOG REINDEER 
IT'S LIKE HOW I FEEL WHEN I DRIVE WITH SCOOTER THEN I JOIK 
AND THEN THE TIME AND THE TRIP IS NOT SO LONG WHEN YOU JOIK 
EVEN THE YOUNGEST MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY ENJOY THESE SONGS 
THIS IS A FAVOURITE WITH ELLE'S YOUNGER BROTHER AND SISTER 
A SONG ABOUT SNOWFLAKES 
IT SAYS THAT SNOWFLAKES BRING THE FREEZING COLD 
BUT ALSO CARPET THE GROUND IN A PROTECTIVE BLANKET 
IT MAY BE A CHILDREN'S SONG 
BUT IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT HOW THE SAMI SEE THEIR ARCTIC WORLD 
AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE NIGHT ONLY LASTS A FEW HOURS 
NOT MUCH TIME TO SLEEP 
DAY TWO AND THE FIRST OF THIS YEAR'S PROBLEMS 
THE WEATHER HAS BEEN MUCH WARMER THAN USUAL 
ONLY AROUND MINUS FIFTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS 
AND THE SNOW IS TOO SOFT WHICH IS SLOWING THE HERD DOWN 
EVEN WORSE THE MELTING SNOW HAS UNCOVERED PATCHES OF GRAZING 
THE SNOW IS SO SOFT AND THE REINDEERS WON'T GO 
THEY JUST WANT TO EAT 
EVERY TIME WE GO THEY WANT TO TAKE A BREAK AND EAT 
THE FAMILY HAS TO GET THE HERD MOVING AGAIN 
THESE DAYS THEY CAN'T JUST RELY ON THE REINDEER'S INSTINCTS 
THEY HAVE A TIGHT SCHEDULE TO KEEP 
THE REINDEER EVENTUALLY TAKE THE HINT 
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS THEY SLOWLY CLIMB INTO THE MOUNTAINS 
BUT THIS YEAR INSTEAD OF MEETING FIERCE BLIZZARDS 
THEY FIND MORE WARM WEATHER AND THAT'S NOT GOOD 
OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING IS THAT THE LAKES ARE MELTING 
AND THE REINDEERS CANNOT COME OVER BECAUSE ITS SO BIG THE LAKES 
AND WE HAVE TO FIND A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN GO OVER 
THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE LONG WAY 
AROUND THE EDGES OF THE MELTING LAKES WHERE THE ICE IS STILL SOLID 
BUT IT WILL ADD A LOT OF TIME TO THE TRIP 
TIME THAT AT LEAST GIVES THE FAMILY A CHANCE TO GO ICE FISHING 
UNDER THEIR FEET ARE DELICIOUS ARCTIC CHAR 
BUT TO GET TO THEM MEANS DRILLING A HOLE THROUGH THE ICE 
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO FISH RIGHT NOW 
BUT MAYBE WHO KNOWS 
I'M SETTING A MARK 
ARGH 
IT'S ALIVE 
THERE WAS A LITTLE FISH 
ICE FISHING ON MIGRATION IS SOMETHING OF A TRADITION 
BEFORE THE DAYS OF SNOWMOBILES THE MORE FOOD THEY COULD FIND ON THE WAY 
THE LESS THEY HAD TO DRAG WITH THEM 
NINE DAYS INTO THE JOURNEY THEY'VE REACHED THE HALFWAY POINT 
BUT THANKS TO THE WARM WEATHER THEY'RE RUNNING LATE 
THEY'RE NOW ONE HUNDRED KILOMETRES FROM THE MODERN WORLD 
AND IMMERSED IN AN ANCIENT WAY OF LIFE 
FOR ELLE'S YOUNGER BROTHER AND SISTER 
IT'S A GLIMPSE OF THE WAY THINGS WERE 
THEIR GRANDFATHER JOHAN HENRIK IS SEVENTY FOUR 
HE'S BEEN DOING THIS MIGRATION SINCE HE WAS THEIR AGE 
AND KNOWS EVERY INCH OF THE WAY 
LIKE MAY TORILL HIS ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS LIFE IS INFECTIOUS 
AND IS ONE REASON WHY THE WHOLE FAMILY MAKE THIS DIFFICULT JOURNEY TOGETHER 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS IMPORTANT WHEN WE ARE ON THE MIGRATION 
IS THAT THE KIDS CAN BE WITH THEIR GRANDFATHER 
BECAUSE HE LOVES TO TELL THEM STORIES 
AND THE KIDS REALLY LIKE TO HEAR THE STORIES 
AND HE HAS A STORY FOR EVERY ROCK FOR EVERY MOUNTAIN 
FOR EVERY LAKE THAT WE PASS 
SO WHEN WE ARE IN THE TENT AND THE KIDS ARE GOING TO SLEEP 
THEN HE LIKES TO TELL US A STORY 
WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES YOU HEAR HIM 
AND IT'S LIKE YOU ARE WITH HIM ON THE TRIP 
THIS STORY ALWAYS THRILLS THE CHILDREN 
ABOUT A WOLF THAT MANY YEARS AGO CRAWLED IN TO JOHAN HENRIK'S LAVVU 
TO SHARE THE WARMTH OF HIS FIRE 
BUT THIS STORY DOESN'T HAVE A HAPPY ENDING 
THE SAMI DON'T LIKE WOLVES 
THEY USED TO BE THE BANE OF THEIR LIVES 
JOHAN HENRIK USED TO SAY WHEN HE WAS WITH THE HERD 
AND THE HERD STARTED TO RUN 
THEN THEY KNEW THAT THE WOLVES WERE AROUND 
AND HE SAID HIS BLOOD TURNED TO ICE 
HE WAS REALLY AFRAID OF THEM 
BUT IN NINETEEN FIFTY THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT THE PEOPLE COULD HUNT THEM 
AND THEY PAID TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NORWEGIAN CROWNS TO GET RID OF THEM 
SO THE PEOPLE WAS REALLY GOING AFTER THE WOLF 
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT YOU SELDOM SEE THE WOLF NOW 
THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL OF WOLVES LEFT IN THE WHOLE OF NORWAY 
SO MODERN SAMI DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR THREAT 
WHEN THEY SLEEP AT NIGHT 
BUT TIME IS PRESSING 
AS SOON AS IT'S LIGHT THE HERD IS PUSHED ON 
TO THE SOUND OF JOHAN HENRIK'S ENTHUSIASTIC JOIKING 
LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD OVER HIS SNOWMOBILE 
IT'S FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
AND IT'S BEEN A COLD NIGHT 
AND THE SNOW IS FROZEN AND IT'S EASY FOR THE REINDEER TO WALK 
THEY GO EASILY BECAUSE THE SNOW IS SO HARD NOW 
TODAY WE ARE MOVING THEM ABOUT TWENTY KILOMETRES 
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE WE REACH THE COAST 
AND IT'S GOING DOWN 
WE'VE BEEN UP AND NOW THE REINDEERS ARE GOING DOWN 
WE HAVE STOPPED HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LET THE REINDEERS REST 
AND WE GIVE THEM SOME LICHEN 
SO THEY CAN EAT 
BECAUSE THE SNOW IS FROZEN 
IT'S GOOD FOR THE REINDEERS TO WALK 
BUT THEY DON'T GET FOOD 
SO WE HAVE TO GIVE THIS AND THEN WE GIVE THIS GRASS 
SO THEY CAN EAT 
WE WANT TO STAY HERE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS 
SO THEY CAN REST AND THEN WE GO ON 
IT'S A LONG WAY 
AHEAD OF THEM AT THE COAST SPRING IS ALREADY WELL ADVANCED 
AFTER THE SILENCE OF WINTER 
THE SOUND OF RUNNING WATER FILLS THE AIR 
BUT FOR THE FAMILY IT'S A RACE AGAINST THE SEASONS 
ELLE AND INGA HAVE LEFT THE HERD TO GET TO THE COAST 
THE GIRLS WENT ON AHEAD TO MEET THEIR GRANDMOTHER 
WHO DROVE THE LONG ROUTE AROUND THE MOUNTAINS FROM KAUTOKEINO 
THE PROBLEM IS THE BUSY E. SIX ROAD 
WHICH CROSSES THE REINDEER'S ANCIENT MIGRATION ROUTE 
YEAH PEOPLE MUST STAND THERE TO STOP THE CARS AND DOWN THERE 
AND THEY MUST HAVE SAMI CLOTHES SO THEY KNOW WHY TO STOP 
BECAUSE THE REINDEERS ARE GOING OVER THE ROAD 
WHILE THE GIRLS PREPARE TO STOP THE TRAFFIC 
THE HERD IS ON ITS WAY OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS 
AND NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON 
THE RIVERS HAVE STARTED TO FLOW AGAIN 
OFF THE MOUNTAINS AND BACK IN BIRCH FOREST THE FAMILY IS MORE NERVOUS 
PREDATORS ARE TRACKING THE HERD 
ANY REINDEER THAT DROP THEIR CALVES EARLY 
WILL ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF A WOLVERINE 
MAY TORILL CALLS IT THE LONELY HUNTER 
A HABIT THAT HELPS IT TO SURVIVE 
IN MODERN NORWAY 
THE HERD HAS TO HIT THE EXACT SECTION OF ROAD 
THAT ELLE AND INGA ARE READY TO CLOSE 
SO THEY'RE LED BY A TAME REINDEER CALLED A HEARGI IN SAMI 
ANOTHER REINDEER INSTINCT EXPLOITED BY THE SAMI 
THE HERD FOLLOWS EXACTLY IN THE HEARGI'S FOOTSTEPS 
THE LAST OF THE HERD IS SAFELY ACROSS 
BUT THE JOURNEY IS FAR FROM OVER 
WITH NO SNOW THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW THE HERD ON FOOT 
DOWN A LONG PENINSULA THAT JUTS OUT TOWARDS THE SUMMER ISLAND OF ARNOYA 
ELLE INGA AND BERIT HAVE GONE AHEAD 
AND HAVE SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE THE HERD CATCHES UP 
SO IN TRUE SAMI TRADITION THEY COOK UP A SNACK OF REINDEER 
IT'LL BE ANOTHER SHORT NIGHT 
FOR THE SAMI TIME ISN'T DETERMINED BY CLOCKS BUT BY REINDEER 
IT'S WELL BEFORE DAWN WHEN THE HERD ARRIVES 
AND IS DRIVEN INTO A CORRAL ON THE SHORE 
IT'S TAKEN NEARLY THREE WEEKS TO GET THIS FAR 
THE WHOLE HERD HAS ARRIVED SAFELY 
BUT EXACTLY HOW MANY ARE MILLING AROUND THE CORRAL 
ONLY ELLE'S FATHER KNOWS 
ASKING A SAMI HOW MANY REINDEER HE OWNS IS AS RUDE AS ASKING SOMEONE 
HOW MUCH THEY HAVE IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNT 
IT'S JUST NOT DONE 
AND THIS IS WHY THE FAMILY WERE SO KEEN 
TO STICK TO THEIR TIGHT SCHEDULE 
ANOTHER MODERN AID TO REINDEER HERDING 
A CONVERTED CAR FERRY HIRED TO TAKE THEIR HERD ACROSS TO THE ISLAND 
THE PREGNANT COWS ARE CLOSE TO GIVING BIRTH AND IT MIGHT NOT LOOK IT 
BUT THIS IS THE MOST STRESS FREE WAY TO GET THEM TO THE ISLAND 
IT'LL TAKE SEVERAL TRIPS TO FERRY THE WHOLE HERD ACROSS 
AND AFTER THREE WEEKS WITH LITTLE SLEEP 
THERE'S YET ANOTHER LONG DAY AHEAD FOR THE GIRLS 
I THINK WE ARE FINISHED ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK TOMORROW 
BUT AT LEAST THE WARM AND CALM WEATHER MAKES THE CROSSINGS EASIER 
YOU SEE THE SEA 
IT'S NO WIND 
THE BOAT IS GOING IN SCHEDULE 
IT HAS BEEN REALLY A NICE TRIP 
AND I HOPE WHEN WE GET THE LAST GROUP THERE 
THEN THE REINDEERS CAN START THEIR HOLIDAY 
AND WHEN THEY COME TO ISLAND 
THE GRASS IS GROWING 
AND I HOPE THAT THE REINDEERS HAVE A GOOD TIME ON THE ISLAND 
AND THAT WE GET MANY CALVES 
SO WE'LL SEE I REALLY HOPE 
THE ISLAND OF ARNOYA IS LARGE TEN KILOMETRES BY TWENTY KILOMETRES 
AND THE HERD CAN WANDER WHERE THEY WILL OVER THE MOUNTAINS 
THE CLIMATE THIS CLOSE TO THE OCEAN IS MILDER 
GIVING THE GRASS HERE A HEAD START 
PLENTY OF GOOD GRAZING FOR THE REINDEER TO RECOVER 
FROM THE LEAN WINTER 
BUT THAT'S ONLY ONE REASON WHY THE FAMILY AND THEIR HERD HAVE TRAVELLED ON SUCH A HARD JOURNEY 
THE MAIN REASON IS THAT THERE ARE NO PREDATORS 
LIKE WOLVES AND WOLVERINES ON THE ISLAND 
THE ONLY DANGER HERE IS FROM ABOVE 
AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO LOOK UP FOR IS THE EAGLES 
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF THEM ON THE ISLAND 
WHITE TAILED SEA EAGLES 
ARE BIG ENOUGH TO TAKE THE YOUNG REINDEER CALVES 
AND GOLDEN EAGLES ALSO PATROL THE SKIES LOOKING OUT FOR NEWBORNS 
THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE TO HANDLE 
BUT IF YOU ARE CLOSE TO THE REINDEERS THEN IT'S POSSIBLE 
THAT YOU CAN SAVE SOME OF THE REINDEER CALVES 
THE SAMI PROTECT THE REINDEER 
BUT THE REINDEER CAN LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES 
REINDEER CALVES ARE UNIQUE AMONGST DEER 
WITHIN A FEW HOURS OF BIRTH 
THEY'RE ON THEIR FEET AND FOLLOWING THEIR MOTHERS AROUND 
UNLIKE OTHER DEER THE FEMALES HAVE ANTLERS 
AND KEEP THEM LONGER THAN THE MALES TO PROTECT THE NEWBORN CALVES 
SUMMER BATHES THE ISLAND IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF DAYLIGHT 
FUELLING THE GROWTH OF NUTRITIOUS GRASS 
THE CALVES FED ON THE RICHEST MILK OF ANY DEER 
ARE BIG ENOUGH TO BE SAFE FROM EAGLES 
SO THEIR MOTHERS DROP THEIR ANTLERS AND START TO GROW NEW ONES 
OVER SUMMER ELLE IS BACK IN SCHOOL IN KAUTOKEINO 
BUT THIS IS NO ORDINARY SCHOOL 
IT'S A SAMI REINDEER SCHOOL 
WHERE THE PUPILS ARE TAUGHT THE MOST MODERN TECHNIQUES OF REINDEER MANAGEMENT 
AS WELL AS THE OLD SAMI TRADITIONS 
HERE WE HAVE SEVERAL COURSES FOR THE STUDENTS 
THIS YEAR I THINK WE HAVE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TEN POINT ONE TWO OH STUDENTS 
AND FIVE OR SIX COURSES 
THREE OF THEM ARE VOCATIONAL STUDIES 
AND ONE IS FOR REINDEER HERDING 
THE VERY LATEST TECHNOLOGY IS ADDED TO THE LONG SAMI TRADITION 
SAMI CHILDREN OWN THEIR OWN REINDEER IN THE FAMILY HERD 
AND RECOGNIZE THEM FROM A UNIQUE SET OF MARKS CUT INTO THE EARS 
AND THE INTERNET IS THE PERFECT WAY TO KEEP TRACK 
OF A BEWILDERING VARIETY OF EAR MARKS 
THIS IS INGA'S EARMARK 
AND THIS IS MINE 
I GOT MY EAR MARK WHEN I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD 
AND I GOT MINE WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD 
SUMMER IN THE ARCTIC IS SHORT 
BEFORE LONG AUTUMN IS HERE 
A BRIEF DISPLAY OF VIVID COLOUR BEFORE WINTER RETURNS 
THE REINDEER HAVE BEEN FEEDING WELL ALL SUMMER 
AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF HEALTHY CALVES 
TIME FOR ELLE AND HER FAMILY TO RETURN TO THE ISLAND 
FOR THE NEXT PART OF THE YEARLY CYCLE 
BUT FIRST THEY HAVE TO FIND THEIR HERD 
WHICH HAS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE ISLAND 
SO NOW YOU HAVE TO LOOK EVERYWHERE FOR THE REINDEERS 
THEY COULD BE EVERYWHERE 
BUT THEY ARE ON THE HIGHEST PLACES NOW 
GETTING THE HERD BACK TOGETHER AT THIS TIME OF YEAR 
MEANS FIGHTING THE REINDEER'S INSTINCTS 
IN THE HERD YOU HAVE THE BIGGEST MALE 
HE'S THE BOSS FOR EACH GROUP 
AND HE'S GOING TO GET THE FEMALE REINDEERS IN SMALLER GROUPS 
AND THEN HE TAKES THEM AWAY 
AND HE CAN GO ON THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN 
AND HE WON'T LET THEM GO DOWN BEFORE HE'S DONE HIS JOB 
SO WE HAVE TO GET THE REINDEERS TOGETHER 
AND GET THEM OVER TO THE MAINLAND BEFORE THE MATING HAS STARTED 
MAY TORILL AND ELLE HAVE FOUND MOST OF THEIR HERD 
AND RADIOED THEIR POSITION TO THE REST OF THE FAMILY 
WITH AN HOUR OR TWO TO SPARE BEFORE THE ROUND UP BEGINS 
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME TO LIGHT A FIRE AND COOK UP ANOTHER REINDEER DELICACY 
BONE MARROW 
IT'S REALLY NICE IT'S DELICIOUS 
BUT YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO IT 
ONCE WE WERE MOVING WITH THE REINDEERS 
AND WE HAD A DOCTOR FROM NETHERLANDS 
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE ATE WAS THIS 
AND HE SAID IT WAS REALLY DELICIOUS BUT HE GOT REALLY PAIN 
THE STOMACH 
IT WAS REALLY PAINFUL FOR HIM BECAUSE HE WASN'T USED TO EAT THIS 
SO HE HAD TO HE JUST HAD TO GO FOR A WALK 
MANY TIMES 
IN AUTUMN THE FAMILY SWITCHES FROM SNOWMOBILES TO QUAD BIKES 
MORE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY THAT MAKES THEIR JOB A BIT EASIER 
AND A LOT FASTER 
THEY ARE REALLY MOVING FAST WITH THE REINDEERS 
A LONG TIME AGO THEY USED TO WALK 
THEY USED TO SAY THAT TO GO TO THIS MOUNTAIN WOULD USE TWO OR THREE DAYS 
NOW THEY ARE MOVING IN A COUPLE OF HOURS 
SO IT'S GOING TO GET MUCH FASTER 
THAN IT DID FOR TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS AGO 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T GET ALL THE REINDEERS IN THE SAME TIME 
WE HAVE TO GET ABOUT THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED REINDEERS IN THE CORRAL 
SO WE GET THE EAR MARKS ON THE REINDEER 
AND SLAKT THE REINDEERS THAT WE NEED 
WE CANNOT WAIT TILL IT'S GETTING TOO DARK 
SO WE HAVE TO BE FINISHED BEFORE SIX O'CLOCK 
SO THE PERFECT THING IS TO HAVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED REINDEERS IN THE CORRAL 
AT THE SAME TIME 
THEY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL ALL THE CALVES FIND THEIR MOTHERS AGAIN 
OTHERWISE NO ONE WILL KNOW WHO OWNS WHICH CALVES 
ELLE'S FATHER NILS JOHAN 
WILL FIND OUT HOW WELL THE FAMILY HERD HAS DONE 
BUT FIRST THEY'VE GOT TO CATCH THE CALVES 
AND AT THE SAME TIME 
SPOT WHOSE MARKS ARE CUT INTO THE MOTHER'S EARS 
THEN THEY CAN MARK THE CALVES 
WE HAVE MINE MY FATHER MOTHER 
AND SISTER AND BROTHER 
AND GRANDMOTHER'S MARK ONE HAVE TO LOOK AFTER 
AS WELL AS EAR MARKING 
IT'S A CHANCE TO GIVE THE CALVES AN ANTI PARASITE MEDICINE 
TO CONDITION THEM FOR THEIR FIRST ARCTIC WINTER 
ONE MORE 
VERY GOOD 
AS WORK PROCEEDS THE FAMILY IS OPTIMISTIC 
YES IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A GOOD CALF YEAR 
SO WE HAVE TO SEE IS IT TRUE 
WHEN MY DAD MARKS A CALF 
HE TAKE A PIECE FROM THE EAR AND PUT IT IN A POCKET 
ONE MORE 
AND AFTER WE FINISHED IN THE CORRAL 
THEN HE COUNTS HOW MANY CALVES HE HAS MARKED 
AND THEN HE KNOWS 
AND WHEN HE KNOWS THE NUMBER HE THROW IT AWAY INTO THE CORRAL 
SO NOBODY ELSE KNOWS HOW MANY HE HAS 
ONE MORE 
ONE MORE 
WE HAVE ALMOST MARKED THE CALVES 
SO WE SHOULD BE FINISHED BY AN HOUR I THINK 
THEN THIS PART OF THE HERD IS DRIVEN OUT OF THE CORRAL 
AND DOWN TO THE SHORE 
ONLY THIS TIME THERE'S NO BOAT 
NOW THE FEMALES ARE NO LONGER PREGNANT 
THEY CAN SWIM TO THE MAINLAND 
AS IN SPRING THE REINDEER KNOW IT'S TIME TO GO 
AND DON'T NEED MUCH ENCOURAGEMENT TO START THEIR AUTUMN JOURNEY 
GOOD SUMMER GRAZING HAS LEFT THE REINDEER IN EXCELLENT CONDITION 
THEY CROSS THE KILOMETRE WIDE CHANNEL EASILY 
TO REACH THE MAINLAND 
AND TOMORROW THE FAMILY WILL BRING THE REST OF THE HERD 
OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS MARK THEM 
AND SWIM THEM ACROSS TO THE MAINLAND 
BUT THE AUTUMN WEATHER IS CHANGEABLE 
AND THE NEXT DAY BRINGS THE FIRST BREATH OF WINTER 
AND ROUGH WEATHER 
TOO ROUGH TO RISK SWIMMING THE HERD ACROSS THE CHANNEL 
ALL THE FAMILY CAN DO IS WAIT IT OUT AND HOPE IT DOESN'T LAST TOO LONG 
THE WEATHER IS STILL BAD 
SHOULD BE ON THE MAINLAND NOW 
IT'S STILL TOO ROUGH AT SEA BUT TIME IS RUNNING OUT 
SO THE FAMILY DECIDE TO RISK BRINGING IN THE REST OF THE HERD 
IN THICK MUD AND FREEZING RAIN 
THEY CATCH AND MARK THE LAST OF THIS YEAR'S CALVES 
THEY'VE NO CHOICE BUT TO RISK THE CROSSING 
THE REINDEER ARE NERVOUS 
BUT THEY'RE DRIVEN BY A STRONG URGE TO RETURN TO THEIR WINTER GROUNDS 
AND ONCE A LEADER TAKES THE PLUNGE THE REST FOLLOW INSTINCTIVELY 
BUT NILS JOHAN IS MORE NERVOUS 
THE SAMI SAY THEIR MONEY ROAMS ABOUT 
AND NILS JOHAN IS WATCHING HIS FAMILY'S LIFE SAVINGS 
SWIM ACROSS THE ROUGH WATER 
ALL THE ANIMALS HAVE MADE IT 
NO CASUALTIES 
ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL YEAR FOR THE PARTNERSHIP OF REINDEERS AND SAMI 
AND AS THE HERD MAKES ITS WAY BACK OVER THE MOUNTAINS TO KAUTOKEINO 
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER YEAR OF LEARNING 
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF REINDEER HERDERS 
THE MORE MAY TORILL'S FAMILY EXPERIENCE THEIR UNIQUE HERITAGE 
THE GREATER THE CHANCE THEY WILL CHOOSE THE LIFE OF A REINDEER HERDER 
I REALLY HOPE THAT ONE OF OUR KIDS WHEN THEY HAVE GOT THE EDUCATION 
THAT THEY CAN WORK WITH THE REINDEER AND DO WHAT WE DO NOW 
BECAUSE THE LIFE WITH THE REINDEERS 
THANKS TO THIS ENTHUSIASM 
ELLE AND INGA SAY THEY WANT TO REMAIN REINDEER HERDERS 
FOLLOWING THEIR HERDS THROUGH NORWAY'S DRAMATIC SEASONS 
BUT THIS ISN'T JUST AN EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO AN OLD WAY OF LIFE 
IT'S A VERY PRACTICAL HARD HEADED DECISION 
SAMI LIFE STILL FLOURISHES IN MODERN EUROPE 
BECAUSE THE SAMI MAKE MONEY FROM THEIR HERDS 
TURNED INTO LUXURY MEAT AND SKINS 
THESE ANIMALS GENERATE A GOOD INCOME 
BUT EVEN IN THE MODERN WORLD REINDEER HERDING IS HARD WORK 
THE SAMI SAY THEY LIVE THEIR LIVES AS THE REINDEER DECIDE 
A WAY OF LIFE THAT WILL SURVIVE ONLY AS LONG AS EACH NEW GENERATION 
CAN SEE THE ENCHANTMENT IN BEING THE REINDEER HERDERS OF THE NORTH 
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY ARE PROUD OF THE WORK THAT THEY DO 
AND THEY CAN SAY THAT WE ARE SAMI PEOPLE 
AND WE WORK WITH THE REINDEERS 
AND WE LIKE THE JOB THAT WE'RE DOING 
NEXT WEEK NATURAL WORLD FOLLOWS THE MAN 
WHO BRINGS WILDNESS BACK TO BRITAIN 
BY RELEASING LONG LOST BEASTS INTO THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS
