THIS OFFICIAL RECEPTION WHERE KIDZ IN KARE MAGAZINE 
ARE DOING A BIG PHOTO SPREAD ON YOUR FAVOURITE SOCIAL WORKER 
BUT I DON'T HAVE A. 
ELAINE THE PAIN 
IN A MAGAZINE WITH PICTURES 
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE LAWS ABOUT TASTE AND DECENCY 
THERE ARE HALF A DOZEN OF ELAINE'S OTHER KIDS IN THERE 
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT HALF A DOZEN 
BUT ELAINE SAID I WAS SPECIAL 
DUMBER THAN YOU NOW THAT'S A FRIGHTENING THOUGHT 
M. M. M. DELIGHTFUL 
OH OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT HOW SILLY OF ME 
IT'S JUST THAT I JUST FEEL SO HONOURED TO BE HERE 
ELAINE YOU SAID THAT I WAS THE ONLY ONE HERE 
JUSTINE TRACY HOW LOVELY TO SEE YOU SO GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT 
MY OTHER SUCCESS STORIES ARE OVER THERE 
BUT ELAINE YOU SAID THAT TRACY DEAR CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE TALKING 
HE'S WRITING AN ARTICLE IT'S ALL ABOUT ME 
SO LEAVE US IN PEACE WILL YOU THERE'S A GOOD GIRL 
OF COURSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHILDREN 
THEIR WELFARE IS CENTRAL TO EVERY SINGLE DECISION I MAKE 
I CAN'T STRESS THAT STRONGLY ENOUGH IT'S A QUESTION OF EXPERIENCE 
IT WASN'T ME 
I'M SORRY I THOUGHT I SAW YOU TALKING TO ELAINE BOYACK 
IS SHE YOUR SOCIAL WORKER 
I'M A JOURNALIST WITH KIDZ IN KARE MAGAZINE YOU SEE 
AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD TALK TO ME ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HER 
YOU CAN'T MESS WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY THOSE ARE THE RULES 
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR RING BACK WHEN I GET IT OFF I DON'T WANT IT 
I MEAN I DO IT JUST 
IT JUST BRINGS BACK BAD MEMORIES 
YOU CAN THROW IT IN THE BIN FOR ALL I CARE CRASH 
DOES THIS MEAN I CAN KEEP IT 
BOO BOO 
AND THEN THERE WERE THOSE STUPID ACTIVITY DAYS SHE MADE US DO 
OF COURSE ONE OF MY STRENGTHS HAS BEEN ORGANISING ACTIVITY DAYS 
DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME SHE DROVE US TWENTY MILES 
SO WE COULD SIT IN A FIELD AND THINK ABOUT NOTHINGNESS 
AND TEACHING MEDITATION 
ENCOURAGING THE CHILDREN TO BE AS ONE WITH NATURE 
FIRST AID OH AND A WIDE RANGE OF ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 
NO NO THE WORST ONE WAS WHEN SHE BROUGHT IN THOSE BIG SPONGY HAMMERS 
SO THE KIDS COULD WORK OUT THEIR AGGRESSIONS ON ONE ANOTHER 
AND THEN SHE WONDERED WHY THEY WENT AFTER HER 
NOT TO MENTION CONFLICT RESOLUTION 
WE'RE A TEAM AND ALL GOOD TEAMS WORK WELL TOGETHER 
SO LET'S SHOW EVERYONE WHAT A GREAT TEAM WE ARE 
OH 
IN FACT I'VE GOT SOME LETTERS HERE FROM SOME CHILDREN 
WHO'VE APPRECIATED THE WAY I'VE HELPED THEM CHANGE DEVELOP AND 
I'M SURE THEY'D HAVE GIVEN YOU A DOGGIE BAG IF YOU'D ASKED
