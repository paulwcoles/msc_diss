STRAIGHT OFF THE STREET INTO HER SITTING ROOM 
FRONT GARDEN FRONT GARDEN AND SHE'S A GREAT GARDENER

WE'RE SURROUNDED BY STREETS AND STREETS OF TERRACED HOUSES 
ONE HUNDRED TEN GRAND WALK IN THE PARK 
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE COMPREHENDED THE SITUATION DOM THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOUSES 
IT IS ABOUT DEALING WITH AN ARTIST AND AN ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT 
ONE MINUTE THEY'RE ORGANIC VEG THE NEXT MINUTE THEY ARE SEETHING MASS OF ARTISTIC FRUSTRATION 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING ON ABOUT

WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THIS SPACE 
UM VEGGIES GROW NICE VEGGIES 
I CANNOT SPEAK TO YOU NOW I'VE GOT A MOUTH FULL OF JAMMY DODGER THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T PUT ONE IN 
YOU WOULD LEAVE IT AS IT IS JUST WEED IT AND PUT THE VEGETABLES IN 
YES I THINK SO I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE CONCRETE NO 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN DO WITH IT I CAN DIG IT UP AND PUT SOME GRASS DOWN 
I THINK YOU SHOULD GET RID OF ALL THE CONCRETE AND THE PATH 
BECAUSE IT IS VERY BORING THERE IS NO SENSE OF JOURNEY 
NOTHING PULLS YOU DOWN YOU CAN SEE THE END OF THE GARDEN WHY BOTHER WALKING DOWN THERE 
YOU NEED TO CREATE MYSTERY AND EXCITEMENT FIRST OF ALL GET RID OF THE STRAIGHT PATH 
DO SOMETHING THAT CURVES AROUND PUT INTERESTING PLANTING 
PUT DIVIDERS UP SO THAT YOU ARE CURIOUS AND WANT TO EXPLORE 
AND THEN I WOULD PLANT YOUR VEGETABLES AMONGST THE MORE CONVENTIONAL FLOWERS 
SO EVERYTHING IS A JOURNEY AND EXCITEMENT 
OTHERWISE AS IT IS NOW IT IS VERY DULL 
PLAIN VERY DULL ARE YOU EXCITED THOUGH 
YES I LIKE THE GARDEN NICE SPACE TO SIT OUT 
YES SUNTRAP BUT ARE YOU GOING TO BE TRAPPED BY THE PRICE

SO WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST 
YOU CAN GO FIRST NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
NINETY FIVE 
I'D SAY NINE NINE FIVE ZERO ZERO YOUR BUDGET WAS ONE HUNDRED TEN 
THIS PROPERTY IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT OVER YOUR BUDGET 
IT IS ACTUALLY OFFERS AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
O. K. A LITTLE BIT DEARER BUT DON'T FORGET YOU GET FIVE PER CENT OF THAT BACK 
YOU ARE GETTING ALL YOUR LEGAL FEES PAID YOU ARE ALSO GETTING CASH BACK 
AND YOU HAVE ALSO AS I SAID EARLIER GOT THAT OPTION NOW 
BECAUSE OF WHAT THIS ACTUALLY SAYS BLACK AND WHITE BASICALLY PUT A SENSIBLE OFFER IN 
A BIT OF A BARGAIN YES 
SO IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE DEARER THAN WHAT YOU THOUGHT 
DON'T BE PUT OFF WE CAN CERTAINLY GET THAT DOWN 
OR THERE IS ONE OTHER OPTION 
GO ON YOU CAN LOOK AT MY CHOICE COME ON LET'S DO IT RIGHT BE PREPARED FOR DISAPPOINTMENT 
THE DECK AREA IS A GREAT ADDITION AND AN IDEAL SUNTRAP WHICH WOULD 
ALSO MAKE A GREAT OUTDOOR DINING SPACE 
THE PAINTED BRICK WALLS OFF THE KITCHEN THOUGH 
WOULD NEED REGULAR MAINTENANCE TO RETAIN THEIR APPEARANCE 
DOMINIC PREPARE TO KISS GOODBYE TO MOCHA CHOCOLATTE 
MY CHOICE IS NEXT A VERY SIMILAR BEAST FROM THE OUTSIDE BUT A FEW 
SUBTLE DIFFERENCES ON THE INSIDE NAMELY THE DECOR WHICH IS TO DIE FOR 
VERY SIMILAR IT IS ALMOST A CARBON COPY 
STILL IT'S A NICE LOOKING PLACE IN A PRIVATE LOCATION CLOSE TO THE CITY CENTRE BUT IT IS NOT GONNA WIN 
DOMINIC FORGET YOUR PANINI 
EAT YOUR HEART OUT 
O. K. SARAH AND GINA HERE WE ARE ARRIVING AT MY CHOICE PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
O. K. IT MAY LOOKS SIMILAR FROM THE OUTSIDE TO DOMINIC'S PROPERTY 
BUT WE ALL KNOW IT IS NOT WHAT IS ON THE OUTSIDE THAT MATTERS IT IS WHAT IS ON THE INSIDE 
WHERE DOMINIC'S WAS A RATHER BLAND BORING RELENTLESS AFFAIR WHAT I HAVE GONE FOR HERE IS CHARM

GOODNESS THESE ARE VERY STEEP 
NOT TO BE DONE LATE AT NIGHT 
YOU KNOW HOW WE NORMALLY MOCK PEOPLE FOR SAYING IT IS A REALLY STEEP STAIRCASE

OPPOSITE THE PUB

QUITE A DECENT SIZE 
YOU HAVE GOT DOUBLE BED 
ROOM TO PUT A DOUBLE BED IN

REALLY KNEW ABOUT COLOURS AND KNEW ABOUT DOING THINGS 
WHOEVER DID THIS HOUSE UP NEEDS A CHECK UP FROM THE NECK UP 
RIGHT WE HAD BETTER GO DOWN AND SEE WHAT THE BOYS THINK 
DOMINIC I HAVE GOT TO BE HONEST THAT WILL BE A FIRST 
RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE THE LION FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ

O. K. NOT THE BIGGEST VISUAL TREAT EVER IS IT NOT FOR PEOPLE OF YOUR HEIGHT NO 
IF I WAS TO STAND UPRIGHT I WOULD BE DOING THIS SO I AM COMING DOWN TO YOUR LEVEL 
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS HOUSE IS THE BATHROOM YES 
YOU HAVE GOT THIS SPACE DOWN HERE 
IT WILL COST A BIT BUT YOU CAN DIG IT OUT A BIT 
YOU CAN TANK IT OUT AND I HAVE SEEN BEFORE AND IT DOES WORK VERY WELL IN 
PROPERTIES OF THIS AGE PUTTING A BATHROOM IN THE BASEMENT 
I HAD NOT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT YES 
IT REALLY DOES WORK WELL 
IF YOU TAKE THIS OUT YOU HAVE QUITE A BIT OF SPACE 
LOADS OF ROOM FOR A BATH SHOWER LOO DONE

ANOTHER BEDROOM YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT THERE WHAT DO YOU NEED TO LOOK OUT AT THE STARS FOR 
WHO NEEDS LIGHT THESE DAYS I LIKE IT 
ALL YOU NEED IS A CURTAIN AND YOU THINK YOU HAVE GOT A WINDOW 
YOU ARE RIGHT THIS IS QUITE A BIG ROOM 
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TALK HER ROUND TO THIS PROPERTY BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A VERY NICE HOUSE AND I DO NOT

NO CAN WE WORK TOGETHER ON THAT ONE O. K. 
I KNOW YOU ARE OUT TO GET DOM HEY THERE IS A LATTE IN THIS FOR SOMEONE OH FOR ME

ARE HAVING A SIDE BET ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO FIND YOU THE BEST HOUSE 
I AM GOING TO TRY AND NOT LET THAT BET INFLUENCE WHAT I AM ABOUT TO 
TELL YOU BUT KRIS SEEMS TO THINK THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS HOUSE 
IS THE FACT THAT TO GET TO THE BATHROOM YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SECOND BEDROOM 
YES I THINK IT LIES A LITTLE BIT DEEPER THAN THAT 
DO YOU REMEMBER LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SEEING THAT GARDEN AND YOU REALLY LIKED IT YES 
PICTURESQUE ISN'T IT

SARAH CAN I JUST ASK YOU HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT YOUR TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER A FIRST TIME BUYER WAS ACTUALLY 
A LOT GOT CLOSER ON GUESSING THE LAST HOUSE PRICE BY A LONG CHALK COMPARED TO YOU 
I KNOW BAD WASN'T IT

SHALL WE ACTUALLY TURN THE PRESSURE NOW ON GINA AND MAKE HER GUESS 
YES LET'S DO IT LET'S DO IT 
COME ON YOU'RE GOING TO GO FIRST 
DO REMEMBER YOUR BUDGET IS ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO PRICE THIS HOUSE AT 
UM ONE HUNDRED FOUR 
SARAH WHAT DO YOU THINK 
BEARING IN MIND THAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY 
GO NEARER HER BUDGET FOR THIS ONE I'M GOING TO GO FOR ONE HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
RIGHT THAT'S GREAT 
KRIS HAS NOW GOT TO WORK OUT WHO'S CLOSER I KNOW WHO'S CLOSER DO YOU 
THE OLD SAYING IS ALWAYS TRUE MUM DOES KNOW BEST 
ACTUALLY THIS PROPERTY IS FIFTY QUID SHORT OF YOUR BUDGET WHICH MEANS IT'S ONE HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WHICH I THINK IS VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY MYSELF 
CAN I JUST SAY JUST BEFORE WE GO ON TO THE WILD CARD WITH ALL THE 
INCENTIVES THAT ARE ON MY PROPERTY THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY DEARER 
KERCHING WILD CARD COME ON 
I'M SO GOING OFF THE MAN AFTER YOU SARAH 
RIGHT 
IF GINA WANTED TO CONVERT THE CELLAR INTO A ROOM SHE WOULD HAVE TO GET IT 
FULLY WATERPROOFED BY A QUALIFIED EXPERT WHO WOULD PUT IN A MEMBRANE TO KEEP OUT THE DAMP 
O. K. THE WILD CARD 
NOW THIS IS A GREAT EXERCISE IN WHAT'S AVAILABLE IF BUYERS LIKE GINA STRETCH THEIR IMAGINATION 
THIS TICKS EVERY ONE OF HER METICULOUS LITTLE BOXES WITH JUST ONE SMALL DOWNSIDE 
DESPITE THAT I THINK SHE'S GOING TO LOVE IT 
IT'S IN THE UP AND COMING AREA OF ALVESTON A SUBURB OF DERBY WHICH 
WAS ONCE A VILLAGE DATING BACK TO THE ELEVENTH CENTURY 
A SHORT CYCLE FROM THE CITY CENTRE AND CLOSE TO THE NEW PRIDE PARK DEVELOPMENT 
PROPERTY NUMBER THREE THE WILD CARD IS GOING TO BE A SERIOUS CONTENDER 
IT DOES WORRY ME SLIGHTLY JUST SLIGHTLY 
THIS ONE IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
THE HOUSE IS ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OLD INSIDE IT LOOKS ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES OLD
