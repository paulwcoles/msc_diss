IT'S A TOWN WITH A SUPERB HERITAGE AND EVERYBODY IN THIS MASSIVE QUEUE JUST WANTS TO FLOG IT 
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF QUEUES ON FLOG IT BUT NONE AS BIG AS THIS 
IT'S SO LONG THE B. B. C. HAVE GIVEN ME THIS BIKE 
TO MONITOR WHAT'S GOING ON 
IT'S NINE HUNDRED THIRTY SO LET'S GET THE DOORS OPEN AND EVERYBODY INSIDE 
TODAY WE HAVE DELIGHTFUL EXPERTS ANITA MANNING AND NIGEL SMITH 
BUT IT SEEMS ANITA IS ALREADY SAYING HI DE HI TO HER FIRST FIND 
SUE DO YOU GO TO BUTLINS FOR YOUR HOLIDAYS I DID MANY MANY YEARS AGO THOUGH NOT QUITE RECENTLY 
DID YOU COLLECT THESE BADGES I WOULDN'T THINK SO 
NO THEY'RE BEFORE MY TIME THEY DO DATE BACK TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY PASSED THEM TO MY MOTHER 
HE PASSED AWAY ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO 
BUT PASSED THEM ON TO MY MOTHER AND SHE'S PASSED THEM ON TO ME NOW 
THESE MAKE ME FEEL HAPPY THEY REMIND ME OF MY OLD DADDY 
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL MY MOTHER WENT TO ROME FOR A HOLIDAY 
AND MY DAD TOOK MY BROTHER SISTER AND I DOWN TO BUTLINS IN AYR 
ALL RIGHT WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY HERE 
THE OLDEST ONE IS NINETEEN FIFTY THREE 
AND THAT'S FROM AYR 
IT HAS THE LION RAMPANT IT HAS AN OLD FASHIONED FEEL 
THE REST HAVE A MORE MODERN FEEL 
SO WE HAVE BUTLINS IN IRELAND 
WE HAVE SKEGNESS 
WE HAVE UM CLACTON 
AND SO ON 
THOSE ARE SOMEONE'S HAPPY MEMORIES MAYBE NOT YOURS 
NO NO 
BUT YOU'RE HAPPY TO SELL THEM OH YES YES 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY BUT THERE WILL BE COLLECTORS FOR THESE OUT THERE 
THE SALE WILL GO ON THE INTERNET 
AND YOU MAY GET COLLECTORS OF THIS TYPE OF ITEM 
OR MAYBE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL SOPPY ABOUT BUTLINS GOING FOR THEM 
I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF HAPPY MEMORIES FROM BUTLINS 
INCLUDING YOU AND I YES DEFINITELY 
VERY DIFFICULT TO GIVE A PRECISE VALUATION ON A THING LIKE THIS 
BUT IF WE PUT THEM SAY THIRTY TO FORTY 
WE'VE GOT A GOOD CHANCE OF THEM GOING AWAY AT THAT 
ARE YOU HAPPY TO SELL THEM AT THAT YES 
LET'S PUT A RESERVE OF TWENTY ON THEM TO PROTECT THEM IN CASE THERE'S NO GREAT INTEREST ON THE DAY 
BUT I'M SURE THERE WILL BE THANK YOU 
MIKE HELLO YOU'VE BROUGHT THIS RATHER SCRUFFY LOOKING BOOK ALONG 
WHICH IS WONDERFUL WHEN WE OPEN IT UP 
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT IT 
IT WAS LEFT TO ME BY A LOCAL SIGNWRITER CALLED BILLY SMITH 
HE DIED OVER TEN YEARS AGO NOW 
HE LEFT IT TO ME BECAUSE I'M A GRAPHIC DESIGNER AT THE TOWN HALL 
AND HE THOUGHT I WOULD FIND IT OF BENEFIT 
WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS THE PRACTICAL DECORATOR AND ORNAMENTIST 
WHEN WE OPEN IT UP THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS IS THESE WONDERFUL CHROMOLITHOGRAPHS INSIDE 
AND IT COVERS ALL ASPECTS OF DESIGN 
IT WAS POPULAR IN THE LATE VICTORIAN PERIOD REALLY 
AND ALL THE INFLUENCES FROM GREEK ROMAN INTO JAPANESE DESIGN AS WELL 
THESE ARE WONDERFULLY DONE IMAGES 
MY FAVOURITES ARE THESE WONDERFUL GOLD HIGHLIGHTED JAPANESE INSPIRED PRINTS 
AND I SUPPOSE THESE IMAGES WOULD HAVE BEEN USED 
AS TEMPLATES OR IDEAS FOR INTERIOR DESIGNERS IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES 
THIS WAS AVAILABLE ONLY BY SUBSCRIPTION 
IT WAS PUBLISHED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY SO NOT MANY WERE PRINTED 
THERE MIGHT BE A FEW HUNDRED SO IT IS A RARE BOOK I THINK SO 
IT IS A SHAME THAT SO MANY OF THESE BOOKS HAVE BEEN BROKEN I'M GUILTY 
I'VE GOT FRAMED PRINTS OF INTERIOR DESIGNS AT HOME ON MY WALL FROM A SIMILAR VOLUME 
BUT THIS ONE IS NEARLY INTACT YES 
ONE OR TWO LOOSE LEAVES BUT IT'S NEARLY ALL THERE 
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED IT'S GOT TO BE WORTH AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED 
AND PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT MORE O. K. 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO SELL IT AT THAT LEVEL I WOULD GO FOR THAT VALUATION YEAH 
I'M HAPPY TO GO WITH YOUR EXPERTISE I THINK THAT'S A SENSIBLE ESTIMATE 
AND THE THING TO DO IS PUT A RESERVE AT TWO HUNDRED TO PROTECT IT 
WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO SELL IT I'VE GOT A VERY OLD COMPUTER 
I WOULD LIKE THE LATEST COMPUTER AND SOFTWARE SO THAT WOULD GO SOME WAY TO HELPING ME BUY A NEW COMPUTER 
A LOT OF DESIGN AND GRAPHICS ARE DONE ON COMPUTER NOW EXACTLY 
IT'S TUGGING AT MY HEARTSTRINGS TO LET IT GO BECAUSE IT WAS LEFT TO ME 
I DON'T WANT TO SEEM DISRESPECTFUL TO THE PERSON WHO'S NOW PASSED AWAY WHO'S LEFT IT TO ME 
SOMEBODY WILL BUY THIS AND GAIN A LOT OF PLEASURE AND KNOWLEDGE FROM IT SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT 
I HOPE IT DOES REALLY WELL THANKS 
PHIL THIS IS SOMETHING YOU LOVE OR YOU HATE WHICH IS IT FOR YOU 
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME I LIKE NATURAL HISTORY 
I LOVE TAXIDERMY AND THIS IS SOMETHING TO CUT MY TEETH INTO 
HOW DID YOU COME ACROSS THEM WE DO HOUSE CLEARANCES YOU DO THAT FOR A LIVING YEAH 
WE WERE ASKED TO MOVE THEM AND THIS IS WHAT WE FOUND SO YOU PUT A PRICE IN FOR THE JOB YOU CLEAR THE LOT 
THEN YOU BREAK IT UP AND PUT BITS INTO AUCTION YEAH 
YOU MUST'VE SEEN SOME FANTASTIC THINGS HAVE YOU RESEARCHED THESE 
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM 
SWORDFISH BLADES SWORDFISH COME FROM THE PACIFIC OR INDIAN OCEANS THE WARM TROPICAL WATERS 
THESE ARE DEFINITELY MID NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN IT WAS ALL THE RAGE IT WAS THE FASHION 
THE VICTORIANS HAD A THIRST FOR INFORMATION EXPLORATION AND KNOWLEDGE 
IT WAS SOMETHING FOR THE PERSON WHO COULD NOT GET AWAY AND EXPLORE 
HE COULD BE HANDS ON AND LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT IT AWAY FROM ITS NATURAL HABITAT 
IT WAS A TEACHING TOOL RIGHT BUT IT BECAME A COLLECTABLE 
THEN IT BECAME AN ART FORM EVERYONE HAD THEIR PRIVATE MUSEUMS 
AND THESE ARE A STUNNING EXAMPLE THE CONDITION IS FANTASTIC 
WHEN THESE WERE PRESERVED IN THE MID NINETEENTH CENTURY THEY WOULD HAVE USED A BORAX PASTE OR AN ARSENIC 
JUST LIGHTLY OVER THE SKIN WHICH STOPS IT FROM ROTTING 
THE TEETH ARE IVORY AND THERE IS NO DECAY ON ANY OF THESE BLADES 
COLLECTORS LOOK FOR GOOD SHARP POINTED TEETH WITH NO DAMAGE 
IT REALLY IS FASCINATING IT COMES UNDER THE SCHOOL OF TAXIDERMY WHICH HAS BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME 
TAXI COMES FROM THE GREEK MEANING MOVE AROUND AND DERMY FROM THE GREEK FOR SKIN 
YOU'VE GOT MOVING SKIN AROUND PRESERVING TAXIDERMY 
AFTER WORLD WAR ONE AND A LOT OF DEATH AND BLOODSHED PEOPLE STARTED THROWING THESE AWAY 
BUT RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN A BIG UPSURGE 
YOU COULD SAY THEY'RE ON THE BILL TODAY AND THESE WILL DO QUITE WELL 
WHAT HAVE YOU IN MIND FIFTY ONE HUNDRED 
THAT'S QUITE CONSERVATIVE I THINK THIS ONE COULD MAKE FIFTY ALONE 
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO PUT THEM INTO AUCTION WITH A VALUE OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
HOW'S THAT HAPPY YEAH AND WE'LL PUT A RESERVE OF ONE HUNDRED RIGHT 
HAPPY VERY HAPPY LET'S FLOG IT LET'S FLOG IT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS EDITH I HAVE AN IDEA TELL ME 
I KNOW THAT IT'S TO PUT SOMETHING IN HONEY I THINK 
THE CLUES ARE THERE YES 
THIS IS CALLED WEMYSS WARE AND IT COMES FROM KIRKCALDY IN FIFE 
ON THE EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND 
IT COMES FROM THE FACTORY OF ROBERT HERON AND SON 
THEY MADE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF WARES 
BUT IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THEY TOOK ON A VERY SPECIAL DECORATOR 
HIS NAME WAS KAREL NEKOLA 
AND HE DECORATED AND DESIGNED THESE WONDERFUL POTS 
LOVELY THEY'RE CALLED WEMYSS WARE 
BECAUSE THEY ARE NAMED AFTER THE WEMYSS CASTLE WHICH WAS NEAR THE FACTORY 
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT LORD WEMYSS WAS A PATRON OF THAT FACTORY 
NOW THE THING ABOUT IT EDITH IT WAS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY 
THIS WAS DECORATED UNDERNEATH THE GLAZE 
WHICH MEANT THAT THE ARTIST HAD ONLY A LITTLE WHILE TO PAINT IT 
HE HAD MORE FREEDOM TO DO THAT AND IT WAS MORE NATURAL AND MORE SUBTLE 
AND THEN THEY COULD ONLY FIRE IT AT VERY LOW TEMPERATURES 
OH AND LOTS OF IT CRACKED 
THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF IT PRODUCED SO IT WAS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE 
IT WAS ONLY THE HOI POLLOI OF THE WORLD THAT COULD AFFORD IT 
THE QUEEN MOTHER WAS ACTUALLY A GREAT COLLECTOR OF WEMYSS 
TELL ME HOW YOU CAME TO GET IT HAVE YOU GOT AN UNCLE WHO'S A LORD OR AN AUNTIE WHO'S A LADY 
NO I'M VERY SORRY NO 
IT CAME TO ME FROM AN OLD MAN 
THAT LEFT HIS BICYCLE OUTSIDE MY GATE 
AND I TOLD MY DAUGHTER TO GO AND BRING IT IN 
IN CASE IT GOT STOLEN YES 
SO SHE DID AND THEN THE NEXT DAY I LOOKED AND IT HAD GONE 
SO I ASSUMED THAT THE MAN HAD TAKEN IT 
ANYWAY HE BROUGHT ACROSS A BIG THING OF FRUIT FOR THE CHILDREN 
AND HE BROUGHT THIS FOR ME AND HE SAID YOU MUST HAVE IT 
I SAID NO I CAN'T HE SAID BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IT'S WORTH SOMETHING 
EDITH THAT'S A LOVELY STORY 
NOW THERE IS A LITTLE DAMAGE 
ON THIS FINIAL HERE THAT'S IT 
IT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO EDITH BEFORE YOU GOT IT IT DID 
BUT WHAT I'VE FOUND IS THAT IF THE PIECE IS RIGHT IT WON'T MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE 
NOW PRICE EDITH I WOULD ESTIMATE IT EDITH 
BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY OH 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO PUT IT IN AUCTION AT THAT ESTIMATE YES 
AND WE'LL PERHAPS PUT A RESERVE OF TWO HUNDRED JUST TO PROTECT IT 
A GOOD ITEM LIKE THIS WILL ALWAYS FIND ITS LEVEL THAT'S FINE 
LET'S SEE WHAT WE'RE PINNING OUR HOPES ON TODAY

SO FAR SO GOOD LATER ON WE'LL BE COMING BACK TO SEE HOW THE REST OF OUR LOTS FARE UNDER THE HAMMER 
NOW I'M GOING TO VENTURE SOUTH AND CROSS THE BORDER TO THE DEEPEST DARKEST WOODS OF NORTH WALES 
I'VE COME TO THE CEIRIOG VALLEY TO MEET A MAN FOR WHOM THESE WOODS ARE HIS HOME AND HIS WORKSHOP 
HE'S PROBABLY THE NEAREST THING YOU'LL FIND TO A TRADITIONAL WOODSMAN ANYWHERE 
HI STUART HELLO I JUST ARRIVED IN TIME HACKING AWAY WITH YOUR BILLHOOK 
IT'S REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU I LOVE YOUR OFFICE YEAH 
IT'S STUNNING YOU'RE CUTTING DOWN HAZEL WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THAT 
THIS HAZEL IS SIX YEARS OLD SO WE'LL GRADE IT OUT AND USE SOME COMPONENTS FOR YURTS 
YURTS THEY'RE TENTS SORT OF MOBILE HOMES 
IT'S A MOBILE HOME OF ASIAN STANDARD 
THEY'RE FROM THE CENTRAL REGION OF ASIA THROUGH MANY AREAS 
THEY'RE A NOMADIC PEOPLE A FANTASTIC COLLAPSIBLE TENT THAT IN BRITAIN WE CAN USE AS EXTENSIONS 
I WANT TO HEAR ALL ABOUT IT WE CAN GO UP TO MY WORKSHOP IN THE WOODS 
FANTASTIC DO YOU NEED A HAND YES TAKE THIS BUNDLE 
O. K. O. K. 
THESE WOODS ARE FANTASTIC 
ARE THEY YOUR WOODS YEAH WE'VE OWNED THEM FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS 
HOW MANY ACRES ABOUT TEN BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE OF THE WOODS 
WHAT ARE THE TREES WE'VE GOT A REAL MIX OF DECIDUOUS 
A LOT OF COPPICE OAK HAZEL CHERRY AS WELL 
OH LOVELY WE'LL PUT THESE DOWN THEN WE CAN GO IN MY WORKSHOP 
NOT MANY CONIFER TREES THEN NO WE DON'T LIKE THOSE DO WE NO 
ANYTHING WITH NEEDLES WE DON'T LIKE DID YOU BUILD THIS 
YEAH IT'S ALL FROM LOCAL TIMBER AFTER YOU THANKS 
WHAT'S YOUR DOG CALLED BISMARCK HELLO HE'S A LURCHER YES 
WHAT A STUNNING WORKSHOP ISN'T IT AND WHAT A VIEW AS WELL 
YEAH WE'RE PERCHED ON THE HILLSIDE WITH A FANTASTIC VIEW IT'S VERY OPEN MY WORKSHOP 
STUART I ENVY YOU I REALLY DO PULL UP A STOOL 
THESE STOOLS ARE FANTASTIC 
HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT BUILDING A YURT IS THERE A STANDARD DIMENSION FOR THEM 
THE YURTS WE BUILD IN BRITAIN ARE BASED ON STANDARD DIMENSIONS 
THE TRELLIS IS CUT TO SIX FEET THEN DRILLED AT REGULAR SPACINGS 
THOSE PIECES ARE TIED SO YOU'VE GOT A STRUCTURE THAT WILL FOLD DOWN INTO A NEAT BUNDLE 
SO IT CONCERTINAS YES INTO A NEAT BUNDLE OF HAZEL 
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE CARRIED UP HERE WHEN IT'S ALL TIED TOGETHER 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WHEN YOU BUILD A YURT YOU HAVE A DOOR FRAME THE TRELLIS ATTACHES TO THAT 
AN IMPORTANT PART IS A TENT BAND WHICH TRADITIONALLY IS WOVEN 
THE WHEEL IS PUT ON THE FLOOR ONE ROOF RIB'S FED IN THEN A THIRD OF THE WAY ROUND ANOTHER ONE'S FED IN 
SO YOU'VE GOT THREE ROOF RIBS THAT PUSH THE WHEEL UP 
THEN YOU FEED IN THE ROOF RIBS AND TIE THEM TO THE TOP OF THE TRELLIS THE FRAMEWORK FOR YOUR YURT 
CAN ONE PERSON PUT THIS TOGETHER YES ONE PERSON CAN PUT A YURT UP TO TWENTY FOUR FOOT DIAMETER ON HIS OWN 
YOU ARE PRESERVING OUR WOODLANDS AREN'T YOU 
YOU FOREST HERE AS WELL BUT IN TRADITIONAL WAYS 
I USE THE TRADITIONAL WAY OF MANAGING A WOOD 
I LET THE SEED FALL FROM TREES SO THE ASH AND THE OAK IS RESEEDED 
THE HAZEL WILL LAYER THE CHERRY IS RESEEDED SO WE'RE NOT INTRODUCING OTHER GENETIC STOCK INTO THE WOOD 
WHAT'S THE BEST BIT ABOUT YOUR JOB LOOKING AT ALL THIS 
BEING OUT HERE AND LOOKING AT THIS FANTASTIC VIEW PERCHED ON THE HILLSIDE WITH THE RIVER BELOW 
I CAN SEE WHERE YOU GET ALL YOUR INSPIRATION FROM LOOK AT THAT 
BEAUTIFUL VIEW I'VE NEVER SEEN A YURT BEFORE 
I'VE SEEN THEM IN BOOKS YOU'VE GOT ONE SET UP SOMEWHERE CAN WE SEE IT 
YEAH I'VE GOT ONE THAT WE USE AS AN EXTENSION 
WHILE WE DO THE BUILDING WORK IN THE HOUSE CAN I HAVE A LOOK YES 
HERE WE ARE WELCOME TO THE YURT CAN I GO IN YES 
WOW OH WOW 
I'LL SHUT THE DOOR TO KEEP THE WARM IN IT IS TOASTY IN HERE ISN'T IT 
IT'S WONDERFUL THIS IS A LIFESTYLE ISN'T IT YOU LIVE IN THIS EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR 
YEAH IT'S AN INSTANT EXTENSION BUT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SPACE TO LIVE IN 
WITH THE LIGHT STREAMING IN IT IS SO WARM 
THE WOODBURNING STOVE YOU DON'T LET GO OUT I GUESS NO 
THIS YURT'S GOT A THICK FELT COVERING LIKE TRADITIONAL YURTS NOT JUST CANVAS 
THE CANVAS IS ON TOP AND IT'S LIKE A CARPET UNDERLAY TRADITIONALLY THEY COVER THE YURTS WITH FELT 
BUT BECAUSE OF OUR WET WEATHER WE HAVE THE FELT WITH A CANVAS COVER 
THE FELT ABSORBS SOUND AND IT KEEPS THE WARMTH IN 
IT'S A KALEIDOSCOPE OF COLOUR WHAT'S IT LIKE LIVING IN HERE THE CIRCULAR SHAPE IS FANTASTIC 
YOU'VE NO CORNERS TO HIDE THINGS IN NO NEGATIVE ENERGY AND IT'S WARM 
YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE I'M AMAZED IT IS TREMENDOUS 
STUART THANKS VERY MUCH FOR SHOWING ME ROUND I COULD JUST SNUGGLE UP AND FALL ASLEEP 
BUT I'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO THE VALUATION DAY AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT'LL TURN UP THERE 
SO BACK IN WARRINGTON LET'S SEE WHAT OUR EXPERTS HAVE FOUND 
I WISH NIGEL I COULD TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THIS PAPER TURNER 
IT'S BEEN IN OUR FAMILY AS FAR AS I KNOW GOING BACK TO THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
MY GRANDFATHER'S SIDE WAS WHERE IT CAME FROM 
BUT THAT IS ALL THAT I KNOW LET'S HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT IT 
YEAH IT CERTAINLY GOES BACK INTO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
A LOT OF PEOPLE CALL THESE LETTER OPENERS I THOUGHT THAT UNTIL I WAS TOLD IT WAS A PAGE TURNER 
PAGE TURNER OR FOLIO TURNER WHAT STRIKES ME IS THIS IS QUITE SHORT 
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN A BIT AND IT'S A BIT NIBBLED ON THE EDGE 
BUT IT'S CARVED OUT OF ELEPHANT IVORY 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UNEASY ABOUT SELLING IVORY THESE DAYS 
BUT THIS IS ANTIQUE IVORY IT'S GOT A LOT OF AGE TO IT 
THE CARVING WOULD PROBABLY BE DIEPPE IVORY 
A CARVING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND THE SUBJECT IS WILLIAM TELL 
THAT'S WHAT ALWAYS FASCINATED ME 
YOU SPOTTED THAT I LISTENED TO THAT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY 
IT'S WILLIAM TELL AND HIS PLUMED HAT AND THE BOY WITH THE APPLE 
HE'S GOT THIS FEARSOME CROSSBOW IT IS A NICE CARVING 
IT'S LOVELY THERE'S SOME DISCOLORATION ON THE IVORY AND THAT JUST SHOWS THAT IT'S BEEN USED 
IT'S FUNNY THAT IT'S A PAGE TURNER BECAUSE I'M A COLLEGE LIBRARIAN 
AND MY SISTER'S WRITTEN BOOKS 
IT'S NICE THAT IT'S RELATED WITH READING MY MOTHER LOVED READING 
SO IT'S A NICE SIDE TO THAT PART OF THE HISTORY OF IT YES 
IT'S CERTAINLY COLLECTABLE PEOPLE COLLECT DECORATIVE IVORY OBJECTS 
AND IT'S A LOVELY PIECE 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD STRUGGLE TO SELL AT ALL 
I THINK WE OUGHT TO PITCH IT SOMEWHERE AROUND ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY RIGHT 
DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU I HAD NOT A CLUE 
I'VE GOT OTHER THINGS TO REMEMBER MY PARENTS BY SO IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE SELLING PART OF THEIR HISTORY 
WHAT'S MADE YOU DECIDE TO SELL IT AT THIS MOMENT JUST MY FINANCIAL SITUATION 
HOPEFULLY WE'LL HELP YOU OUT SLIGHTLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
GAYNOR I LOVE THE ARTS AND CRAFTS PERIOD AND THIS MIRROR IS FROM THAT TIME 
IT'S PARTICULARLY INTERESTING FOR ME BECAUSE I'M FROM GLASGOW 
WE HAD GLASGOW SCHOOL OF ART THERE 
AND YOU HAD WONDERFUL BRASS AND METAL BEATERS WORKING IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS 
SO THE GLASGOW FOLK ARE CRAZY ABOUT ARTS AND CRAFTS 
BUT TELL ME WHERE DID YOU GET IT 
I BOUGHT IT ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO FROM AN ANTIQUES SHOP IN SOUTHPORT 
WHAT DID YOU PAY FOR IT THEN 
IT SEEMED EXPENSIVE BUT I REALLY LIKED IT I PAID EIGHTY 
IF YOU REALLY LIKE SOMETHING WHAT I SAY IS GO FOR IT 
WHAT WE HAVE IS THIS HEXAGONAL BRASS FRAME 
WITH THESE CELTIC KNOTS AROUND THE RIM 
NOW THIS MOTIF WAS PARTICULARLY POPULAR 
DURING THE ARTS AND CRAFTS MOVEMENT 
PEOPLE LOOKED BACK TO MEDIEVAL TIMES FOR THEIR DESIGN 
AND THIS PATTERN REFLECTS THAT INTEREST 
NOW THE MORE INTRICATE THE PATTERN OBVIOUSLY 
THE BETTER THE ITEM AND THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT'LL BE 
I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT THE BEST OF QUALITY 
BUT IT HAS THAT REALLY NICE CELTIC KNOT GOOD MOTIF NICE CONDITION OBVIOUSLY WELL LOOKED AFTER 
NOW BUYING IT IN THE ANTIQUE SHOP YOU PAID RETAIL PRICE FOR IT 
SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO SELL IT IN AUCTION AND MAKE MORE MONEY ON IT 
BUT THIS TYPE OF WARE IS VERY POPULAR JUST NOW 
IT'S QUITE HOT 
I WOULD ESTIMATE IT IN THE REGION OF SAY SIXTY TO EIGHTY 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO SELL IT AT THAT 
YES THE MONEY'S GOING TO A VERY GOOD CAUSE TELL ME ABOUT THAT 
I WENT TO MALAWI A FEW YEARS AGO AND I SAW THE SITUATION OUT THERE 
THE MILES AND MILES THAT PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO TRAVEL FOR A BASIC MEAL 
SO THE MONEY IS GOING TO A HOSPITAL IN MALAWI THAT'S WONDERFUL GAYNOR 
EIGHTY WILL DO AN AWFUL LOT OUT THERE LET'S HOPE IT DOES MORE THAN THAT 
I LIKE TO KEEP THE ESTIMATE REASONABLE TO TEASE THEM ALONG 
SO EIGHTY TO MALAWI BRILLIANT SHALL WE PUT IT TO AUCTION DEFINITELY WE WILL FLOG IT 
RAYNA HI I THOUGHT WE MIGHT SEE A PIECE OF THIS POTTERY HERE 
THIS IS THE ONLY PIECE THAT'S CROPPED UP TODAY IT MUST BE RARE 
TELL ME HOW YOU CAME ACROSS IT IT WAS ALWAYS AT MY GRANDMA'S 
AND AFTER SHE DIED I JUST THOUGHT IT'S REALLY OLD 
AND REALLY UGLY I CAN'T STAND IT 
GOOD SO I JUST THOUGHT IT MUST BE VALUABLE 
IT'S REASONABLY VALUABLE IT'S HAD QUITE A SHORT LIFE THIS FACTORY 
IT WAS MADE IN BIRKENHEAD RIGHT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALISE THAT THIS IS MADE BY THE DELLA ROBBIA ART POTTERY IN BIRKENHEAD 
IT WAS FOUNDED BY HAROLD RATHBONE IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FOUR 
IT FINISHED IN NINETEEN OH SIX SO THERE WASN'T AN AWFUL LOT OF IT MADE 
THEY REALLY CONCENTRATED ON CLASSICAL MAIOLICA FINISHES GLAZES AND SO ON 
SO IT'S A MIX OF ART NOUVEAU AND FIFTEENTH SIXTEENTH CENTURY MAIOLICA 
THE NAME DELLA ROBBIA 
COMES FROM THAT FIFTEENTH CENTURY EARLY SIXTEENTH CENTURY FAMILY OF POTTERS 
IF WE TURN IT OVER WE CAN SEE THE MARK 
THERE'S A LITTLE SHIP DOCTOR FOR DELLA ROBBIA AND THE DATE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SIX 
IT'S GOT A LITTLE CHIP SOMEONE'S BEEN A BIT CARELESS WITH IT 
NOT ME BUT IT IS MADE OF EARTHENWARE 
WITH QUITE A THIN TIN GLAZE ON IT 
SO IT'S QUITE A SOFT AND VULNERABLE POTTERY BUT VERY VERY COLLECTABLE NOW 
SO AMAZING ISN'T IT YES VERY 
IN TERMS OF VALUE WE'LL BE A BIT CAUTIOUS BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE 
AND SAY ROUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MAYBE TWO HUNDRED O. K. 
WOULD YOU WANT A RESERVE ON IT YES ONE HUNDRED I'D BUY IT FOR ONE HUNDRED 
IT MUST BE SAFE AT THAT BECAUSE I'M MEAN I THINK IT'LL MAKE MORE THAN THAT 
FINGERS CROSSED I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT IN I THINK YOU'LL BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED GOOD 
WE HAVE THREE VERY DIFFERENT ITEMS TO ENTICE THE BUYERS TODAY 
THERE IS A MUST FOR ANY BOOKWORMS THE IVORY PAGE TURNER 
WILL PEOPLE BE FEELING CHARITABLE TOWARDS THE ARTS AND CRAFTS MIRROR 
AND FROM BIRKENHEAD THE DELLA ROBBIA POT 
AUCTIONS AREN'T THAT STRESSFUL IT'S NOT ALL GO GO GO 
YOU CAN CHILL OUT BUT LOOKING AT THESE HAS GIVEN ME AN IDEA 
LOTS OF AUCTION ROOMS ARE FULL OF SECOND HAND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
THEY'RE VERY AFFORDABLE AND IF YOU ARE A STUDENT WITH NOT MUCH MONEY 
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY AN INSTRUMENT LIKE A CELLO GUITAR OR VIOLIN 
THIS IS THE PLACE TO COME 
BECAUSE YOU CAN INVEST IN A VERY CHEAP INSTRUMENT GET IT SET UP AT A MUSIC SHOP WITH NEW STRINGS 
IF YOU GET ON WITH IT AND LOVE PLAYING YOU CAN ALWAYS GRADE UP 
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU CAN PUT IT BACK INTO AUCTION AND GET YOUR MONEY BACK 
UP FOR GRABS RIGHT NOW IS MIKE'S WILLIAM TELL PAGE TURNER 
HE'S TEACHING IN MANCHESTER TODAY BUT HIS BEST FRIEND KATE HAS STEPPED INTO THE BREACH 
THE TENSIONS ARE RISING IT'S GOING UNDER THE HAMMER ANY MINUTE HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET THE TOP END 
MIKE'S A LIBRARIAN THIS IS A USEFUL BIT OF KIT FOR HIM WHY'S HE FLOGGING IT HE WANTS THE MONEY 
BILLS TO PAY WE ALL HAVE THAT
