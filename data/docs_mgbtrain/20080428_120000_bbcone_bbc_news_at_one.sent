REFINERY ENTERS ITS SECOND DAY 
THERE IS A STAND OFF BETWEEN 
MANAGERS AND WORKERS CLOSED UP THE

CHANGING THE FINAL SALARY PENSION 
SCHEME IS LIFTED IT ON A DAY'S 
LATE MANAGERS AT INEOS SAY THE 
CHANGES WILL GO AHEAD AT AS 
PLANNED HE IS ONE OF BRITAIN'S 
MOST POWERFUL INDUSTRIALISTS JIM 
RATCLIFFE THE MAN SHELTERING UNDER 
THE UMBRELLA WAS THE TARGET THIS 
MORNING OF A HOSTILE RECEPTION FROM 
STRIKERS TO THE WORKERS OF 
GRANGEMOUTH HE IS THE MAN WITH A 
PERSONAL FORTUNE OF BILLIONS HE 
WANTS TO CLOSE DOWN THEIR PENSION 
SCHEME 
THIS IS NOT A BAD A TRADE SCHEME UNION INITIATIVE FOR A CLAIM IT IS 
ABOUT A DEMAND BY AN EMPLOYER 
ABOUT 
SPENDING THEIR SECOND DAY ON ABOUT THE PICKET LINE WORKERS SAY THEY 
WILL ONLY TALK TO THE COMPANY IF IT 
LIFTS THE DEADLINE FOR CLOSING THE 
PENSION SCHEME 
WE NEED TO MAKE 
THIS CHANGE WE NEED TO MODERNISE 
WE HAVE ALREADY MOVED TO ALLOW 
CONVERSATIONS TO TAKE PLACE AND 
DISCUSSIONS WE CANNOT BE HELD TO 
RANSOM ON THIS 
THE CLOSURE OF THE 
REFINERY IS COSTING THE U. K.'S 
ECONOMY FIFTY MILLION A DAY IN LOST 
OIL REVENUES AS WELL AS THREATENING 
FUEL SUPPLIES IN ABERDEEN THEY 
WERE UNLOADING A SHIP CONTAINING 
EXTRA STOCKS FOR THE NORTH OF 
SCOTLAND ANOTHER VESSEL IS MOORED 
IN THE FIRTH OF FORTH WAITING TO 
SELL UPSTREAM TO GRANGEMOUTH SHIPS 
FROM THE CONTINENT ARE ON THEIR WAY 
TO REPLENISH STOCKS A STEADY 
STREAM OF LORRIES WITH PETROL AND 
DIESEL ARE LEADING THE GRANGEMOUTH 
DEPOT BOUND FOR FORECOURTS ACROSS 
SCOTLAND THE AUTHORITIES SAY 
MOTORISTS DO SEEM TO BE HEEDING 
APPEALS NOT TO INDULGE IN PANIC 
BUYING THE FOCUS IS TO TRY TO FIND 
A WAY TO AVERT ANOTHER DAMAGING 
STRIKE 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE 
SITUATION TODAY 
BUSINESS HAS BEEN BUSY BUT THERE 
HAS BEEN NO SENSE OF PANIC BUYING 
PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS 
INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE FOR SOME TIME 
AND THEY ARE ACCEPTING OF ITS 
CONSEQUENCES FORECOURTS HAVE TAKEN 
THE DECISION TO RESTRICT THE FUEL 
MOTORISTS COME BY HERE YOU CAN 
HAVE MAXIMUM OF TWENTY OF PETROL OR 
DIESEL THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING IN 
TERMS OF MAINTAINING THE SUPPLIES 
AND ENSURING THEY HAVE FURTHER 
SUPPLIES FOR THE DAYS TO COME IN 
TERMS OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FEW OF 
THOSE I HAVE SPOKEN TO ALL 
INTERESTED IN THE DETAILS OF THIS 
DISPUTE THEY JUST WANT IT SORTED 
OUT MOTORISTS DON'T WANT ANY MORE 
DESTRUCTION AND BUSINESSES DON'T 
WANT THIS TO CAST THEM ANY MORE 
CASH ANY SUPPLIES COMING IN TO 
SCOTLAND OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO PETROL 
STATIONS AND HOPEFULLY THERE WILL 
BE A RESOLUTION BETWEEN THE 
MANAGEMENT AND THE REUNIONS 
OUR TOP STORY 
THE WOMAN HELD CAPTIVE IN A CELLAR 
FULL TWENTY FOUR YEARS AUSTRIAN POLICE 
HAVE ARRESTED HER FATHER AND HE HAS 
ADMITTED HAVING SEVEN CHILDREN WITH 
HER HER STILL TO COME ON THE PROGRAMME AS 
C. LEVELS RISE CAN ANYTHING SAVE 
THE NORFOLK BROADS FROM 
DISAPPEARING BELOW THE WAVES 
ON B. B. C. LONDON WHY AGENT SELECTED 
AS A CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE FOR THE 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS IS THREATENED WITH 
CLOSURE CLOSURE ARCHIVES OF TRIALS HUNDREDS OF 
YEARS OLD ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE ALL 
THAT IN FIFTEEN MINUTES 
NOW ALL OF THESE MAY LOOK LIKE 
NORMAL CHILDREN'S TOYS BUT THEY 
ARE CLEVERLY DESIGNED TO HIDE A 
VIDEO CAMERA THE CAMERA IS HIDDEN 
INSIDE ITS MOUTH THEY ARE NANNY 
CAMS AND THEY ARE INCREASINGLY 
BEING USED BY PARENTS TO CHECK UP 
ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF THEIR NANNY OR 
CHILDMINDER EBAY SAYS IT SELLS 
HUNDREDS EVERY MONTH ANOTHER 
ONLINE RETAILER SAYS SALES HAVE 
RISEN FIFTY PER CENT IN THE LAST YEAR 
RETURNING TO WORK AND LEAVING YOUNG 
CHILDREN IN THE CARE OF OTHERS CAN 
BE AN ANXIOUS TIME BUT THE LATEST 
TECHNOLOGY MEANS PARENTS CAN KEEP 
AN EYE ON THEIR CHILDREN FROM A 
DISTANCE AT THIS NURSERY IN NORTH 
LONDON THEY HAVE INSTALLED VIDEO 
CAMERAS WHICH CAN RECORD WHAT IS 
GOING ON 
HE IS SITTING BESIDE HIS 
FRIEND EATING CAKE 
PARENTS CAN LOG 
ON TO A SECURE WEBSITE AND SEE HOW 
WELL THEIR CHILDREN ARE BEING 
TREATED 
I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE TREATED HOW HE JUST DID TO HIS NEW 
ENVIRONMENT IT WAS WONDERFUL TO 
WATCH HIM AND SEE HE IS O. K. THIS THIS HAS BEEN FITTED INTO ALL OF THESE 
ITEMS 
SOME PARENTS HAVE TAKEN ITEMS THIS TO A NEW LEVEL SO CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE PEOPLE LOOKING AFTER 
THEIR CHILDREN THEY ARE INSTALLING 
CAMERAS HIDDEN IN CLOCKS OR TOYS IN 
THEIR HOMES 
IF YOUR CHILD IS AND 
AT SCHOOL AND YOU HAVE EMPLOYED 
SOMEONE TO LOOK AFTER YOUR CHILD AT 
HOME AND THEN MATCH OUT BECOMES 
MAY BE LESS HAPPY THEIR BEHAVIOUR 
CHANGES I DON'T THINK IT IS A 
PARANOID PERSON WANTING TO MAKE 
SURE THE PERSON LOOKING AFTER THEIR 
CHILD CAN BE TRUSTED 
THE TREND FOR 
INSTALLING CAMERAS BEGAN IN THE U. S. 
THESE PUBLICISED IMAGES APPEAR TO 
SHOW A NANNY NEGLECTING A BABY SHE 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AFTER THE 
TECHNOLOGY SEEMS TO BE BECOMING 
MORE POPULAR HERE THE IMAGES CAN 
BE RECORDED FOR PARENTS TO WATCH 
WHEN THEY GET HOME OR THEY CAN BE 
SEEN LIVE ON A COMPUTER OR MONITOR 
LEGALLY WE ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE 
HIDDEN CAMERAS IN OUR HOMES AND 
WHAT THEY RECORD CAN BE USED TO 
PROSECUTE BAD CARERS BUT THOSE WHO 
REPRESENT NANNIES SAY THEY ARE 
CONCERNED 
YOU SELECT A FULLY CONCERNED TRAINED NANNY WHO HAS BEEN VETTED 
AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS 
AND YOU SHOULDN'T NEED THESE 
CAMERAS YOU SHOULDN'T NEED TO SPY 
ON PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE WORKING 
ENSURE SOME OF THESE PARENTS 
WOULDN'T BE HAPPY IF THEY WERE 
BEING SPIED ON AND WATCHED WHILE 
THEY WERE DOING THEIR WORK THE THE CAMERAS DON'T PROTECT CHILDREN AND 
THEIR IMAGES CAN DISTORT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING BUT DESPITE THIS MANY 
PARENTS SEEM KEEN TO EMBRACE ANY 
NEW TECHNOLOGY THEY FEEL GIVES THEM 
PEACE OF MIND 
SCIENTISTS WHO DEVELOPED PIONEERING 
GENE THERAPY WHICH REVERSED A 
TEENAGER'S FAILING EYESIGHT SO THE 
TREATMENT COULD BE USED TO TREAT 
OTHER GENETICS SIGHT DISORDERS THE 
TEAM AT MOORFIELD EYE HOSPITAL AND 
LONDON THINK IT CAN HELP CONDITIONS 
THAT SET IN AS PEOPLE GET OLDER 
SIX MONTHS AGO STEPHEN COULD 
HARDLY SEE IN THE DARK NOW THANKS 
TO A REMARKABLE OPERATION HIS SIDE 
HAS BEGUN TO GET BETTER TESTS IN 
THIS DIMLY LIT MAZE SHOW AN 
IMPROVEMENT HE KEEPS BUMPING INTO 
THE WALLS AND IT TAKES HIM OVER A 
MINUTE TO GET TO THE END LOOK AT 
THIS SIX MONTHS LATER HE GOES 
STRAIGHT THROUGH 
MY SOCIAL LIFE 
HAS IMPROVED NOT MUCH BUT 
SLIGHTLY I CAN DO MORE THAN I USED 
TO AT NIGHT L. HAVE MORE SELF CONFIDENCE 
HIS EYESIGHT WAS CONFIDENCE FAILING BECAUSE OF A FAULTY GENE 
SURGEONS AT MOORFIELD EYE HOSPITAL 
INJECTED GOOD COPIES OF THE GENE 
INTO THE BACK OF HIS EYE THE 
REPLACEMENT GENES HAVE HEALED THE 
DYING CELLS AND IMPROVED HIS SIDE 
FOLLOWING THEIR SUCCESS THE 
RESEARCHERS HOPE TO TRY OUT THE 
THERAPY ON CHILDREN THEY HOPE IT 
WILL HELP THEM SO THEY CAN GROW 
WHOPPER AND LEAD THEIR LIVES TO 
THEIR FULL POTENTIAL THIS BOY IS 
ELEVEN HE HOPES HE WILL BE PICKED FOR 
THE NEXT PHASE OF THE TRIAL SO HE 
WILL BE ABLE TO SEE BETTER AT NIGHT 
WHEN I GO TO SAINSBURY'S WITH MY 
MUM I CAN TAKE THE TROLLEYED BACK 
FOR HER 
HE WOULD LIKE TO HELP YOU 
MORE MORE YES THEY BOTH SUFFER 
FROM A RARE GENETIC DISEASE WHICH 
AFFECTS A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE IN 
BRITAIN BUT THE SURGEONS BELIEVE 
GENE THERAPY COULD BE USED TO TREAT 
A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF I DISORDERS 
POSSIBLY EVEN TO SLOW AGE RELATED 
BLINDNESS 
THIS IS ONLY THE BLINDNESS BEGINNING WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED IN 
PRINCIPLE GENE THERAPY CAN WORK FOR 
A PARTICULAR EYE DISORDER WE HOPE 
FOR SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY WILL BE USED 
FOR OTHER INHERITED DISEASES AND 
OTHER COMMON DISEASES INCLUDED AGE 
RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION 
IT IS 
EARLY DAYS BUT THE RESULTS ARE 
PROMISING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 
IS CONSIDERING EXTENDING THE TRIALS 
TO COVER MORE TYPES OF INHERITED 
EYE DISEASES 
WITH ME IS PROFESSOR JOHN MARSHALL 
A SPECIALIST AT KING'S COLLEGE IN 
LONDON HOW EXCITED ARE YOU THIS 
OFFERS SOME PROMISE 
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW 
EPOCH IT IS DRAMATIC 
BREAKTHROUGH AND THEY ARE TO BE 
CONGRATULATED IT IS THE FIRST TIME 
WE HAVE SEEN SCIENTIFICALLY 
PROVEN TREATMENT FOR INHERITED 
RETINAL DEGENERATION 
PRESUMABLY IF 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INHERITED 
CONDITIONS ARE THERE THINGS TO DO 
TO EDUCATE PEOPLE SO THEY ARE AWARE 
OF THE CONDITION EARLY ON AND 
PRESUMABLY THAT HELPS SCIENTISTS AS 
WELL 
MOST OF THE INDIVIDUALS ARE WELL AWARE THEY HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE 
THESE DISEASES DO RUN IN FAMILIES 
THE EARLIER WE CATCH THEM THE 
BETTER THE POTENTIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL 
TREATMENT 
SO THE NEXT STEP IS TO TREATMENT DO WHAT 
THE NEXT STEP HERE IS TO 
TREAT CHILDREN THE PARTICULAR 
DISEASE WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT IN 
THIS CLIP USUALLY RESULTS IN 
BLINDNESS IN PEOPLE BY THE AGE OF 
THIRTY THE NEXT STEP OF THIS TRIAL 
WILL BE TO TREAT YOUNG CHILDREN 
EARLY CHILDHOOD AND PREVENT THEM 
HAVING ANY VISUAL LOSS AT ALL 
WHICH IS VERY EXCITING NEWS 
SIX PALESTINIANS INCLUDING FOUR 
CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF ONE 
AND SIX AND THE MOTHER HAVE BEEN 
KILLED IN BY AN ISRAELI MISSILE 
IT HAPPENED IN BEIT HANOUN CLOSE 
TO AN AREA PALESTINIAN MILITANTS 
USED TO LAUNCH ATTACKS ON ISRAEL 
WHAT ARE BOTH SIDES SAYING ABOUT 
THIS ATTACK 
THIS WAS AN OPERATION WHICH STARTED 
IN THE MORNING ISRAELI GROUND 
TROOPS MOVED INTO THE GAZA TRIP 
BACKED BY MILITARY AIRCRAFT IT 
FOLLOWED FIGHTING WITH PALESTINIAN 
GUNMEN AND THESE MISSILE STRIKES 
AIR STRIKES AND TANK SHELL STRIKES 
THE MISSILE HIT THIS HOUSE A 
MEMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS OF THE FAMILY 
WAS HAVING BREAKFAST AND FOUR 
CHILDREN TWO BROTHERS AND TWO 
SISTERS ALL UNDER THE AGE OF SIX 
WERE KILLED AND THEIR MOTHER AS 
WELL THE SPOKESWOMAN HAS SAID IF 
GUNMAN OPERATE IN CIVILIAN AREAS 
CIVILIAN DEATHS ARE LIKELY HAMAS 
OFFERED ISRAEL A CEASEFIRE A COUPLE 
OF DAYS AGO NOW THEY ARE SAYING 
THAT IS OFF THE TABLE AND THEY HAVE 
CALLED FOR A STRONG RESULTS 
RESPONSE FROM MILITANT GROUPS 
HE AT LEAST SEVENTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED AFTER TWO TRAINS COLLIDED IN 
CHINA MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED OTHERS WERE 
INJURED IN THE CRASH IN SHANDONG 
PROVINCE IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY 
IT WAS TRAVELLING BETWEEN BEIJING 
AND THE VENUE THAT WILL BE USED FOR 
THE OLYMPIC SWIMMING COMPETITION 
THERE HAS BEEN A SHARP RISE IN THE 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ABANDONING THEIR 
PETS ACCORDING TO THE R. S. P. C. A. THEY 
SAY PEOPLE ARE GIVING BIZARRE 
EXCUSES FOR DOING SO THE R. S. P. C. A. 
FIGURES SHOW IN TWO THOUSAND SIX NEARLY SIX THOUSAND 
ANIMALS WERE ABANDONED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IT 
ROSE TO MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED UP TWENTY THREE PER CENT ON 
THE PREVIOUS YEAR 
IN CENTRAL LONDON STUDIO IS MARK 
MILES THE CHIEF INSPECTOR FOR THE 
R. S. P. C. A. IN LONDON WHAT IS BEHIND 
THIS DRAMATIC INCREASE 
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THAT 
ENTIRELY BECAUSE WE ARE NOT SURE 
IT COULD BE INDICATIVE OF SOCIETY 
AND WE ARE PART OF A THROWAWAY 
CULTURE IN ENGLAND WHERE YOU GET 
BORED WITH YOUR ANIMAL AND GET RID 
OF IT 
PRESUMABLY IF A VERY VALID 
REASONS YOU NEED TO GET RID OF YOUR 
PET THERE ARE PROPER WAYS TO DO IT 
TO ENSURE ITS WELFARE 
WE HAVE A TWENTY FOUR 
HOUR LINE FOR PEOPLE THAT REQUIRE 
OUR RESISTANCE SO THERE IS NEVER 
AN EXCUSE TO ABANDON THE ANIMALS 
OBVIOUSLY IT IS WORRYING THAT 
FIGURE IS GOING UP 
WE DO HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE 
THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND IS SINKING 
THERE ARE FEARS THAT SOME AREAS 
COULD BE SUBMERGED BEFORE THE END 
OF THE CENTURY ONE SUCH AREA IS 
THE NORFOLK BROADS IT IS FEARED 
THAT SOME LAND COULD BE SACRIFICED 
IN ORDER TO SAVE THE WIDER AREA 
BOATS AND BROADS HAVE BEEN 
INTERTWINED FOR CENTURIES ALL PART 
OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH WATER 
THAT IS LOOKING UNSETTLED A 
TOURIST INDUSTRY FLOATS UPON IT AND 
A DELICATE ECOSYSTEM THRIVES 
BECAUSE OF IT NOW OR COULD BE 
LOST BENEATH IT 
BY SAYING YOU WILL 
DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN FIFTY YEARS 
YOU HAVE EFFECTIVELY TAKEN ONE THOUSAND 
PROPERTIES THAT WERE FREE HOLD AND 
MADE THEM FIFTY YEAR LEASEHOLD THAT 
HAS A DRAMATIC AND SIGNIFICANT 
EFFECT ON THEIR OPEN MARKET VALUE 
THESE SEA DEFENCES WILL BE 
MAINTAINED FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS 
THIS PART OF THE WORLD WILL LOWER 
BY TEN CENTIMETRES SEA LEVELS ARE 
EXPECTED TO RISE BY AROUND METRE 
ONE SCENARIO SAYS LET ALDISS GO 
AND SO RENDER ALL THAT LAND TO 
DECEIVE 
WE CANNOT GO ONE DEFENDING DECEIVE AREAS FOR EVER SO RENDER THEY 
ARE GOING TO CHANGE AND WE HAVE TO 
MANAGE THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW 
BEST WE CAN ADAPT TO THAT THEY THEY HAVE SEEN THE DAMAGE FLOODING CAN 
DO HERE BEFORE IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT THE SEA 
RETREATED IT RETURNED FOR GOOD 
SIX VILLAGES HUNDREDS OF HOMES AND 
NORFOLK'S BIGGEST BROAD WOULD BE 
LOST UNDER WATER 
WHAT HAPPENS 
ABOUT COMPENSATING FOR FRESHWATER 
HABITAT THAT HAS TO BE RECREATED 
THAT IS NOT AN EASY TASK THAT 
NEEDS A COMPLEX LOOK AT THE COSTS 
OF DOING ALL THAT ON NOT TOO FAR 
AWAY FROM DEFENDING THE EXISTING 
LINE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
IT LOOKS 
TO BE A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN 
CLIMATE CHANGE AND COST WHICH 
COURSE TO FOLLOW IT IS STILL TO BE 
DECIDED LET'S TEN OUR ATTENTIONS TO 
THE WEATHER PROSPECTS PETER GIBBS 
HAS JOINED ME A GLORIOUS WEEKEND 
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 
IT IS NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD FOR THE 
BEST OF THE WEEK THERE WILL BE 
PLENTY OF RAIN THE CROWN ACROSS 
THE WHOLE OF THE U. K. SOME PLACES 
HAVE HAD SUNSHINE OTHERS SHOWERS 
THERE IS A GREAT CLUMP OF CLAD 
SPIRALLING IN ACROSS NORTHERN PARTS 
OF SCOTLAND WE HAD SEVERE WEATHER 
WARNINGS HAVE FOR SOME PARTS OF 
EASTERN SCOTLAND IT IS BEGINNING 
TO EASE BUT A MISERABLE AFTERNOON 
FOR A MURRAY AND ABERDEENSHIRE 
FURTHER SOUTH A LITTLE BIT OF 
BRIGHTNESS COMING IN IS SCATTERING 
OF SHOWERS WE HAVE SEEN THUNDERED 
TURNING UP ACROSS THE PENNINES 
THUNDER SHOWERS WILL ARRIVE IN THE 
NEXT HOUR OR TWO A FAIRLY BRISK 
WIND IS BLOWING IN FROM THE NORTH 
WEST PERHAPS IN NORTH DEVON AND 
CORNWALL AND THE WESTERN SIDE OF 
WALES THE SHOWERS WILL BE FEW AND 
FAR BETWEEN THIRTEEN CELSIUS IN THE 
BRIGHTER SPELLS BETWEEN THE SHOWERS 
A FAIRLY COOL AFTERNOON FOR MOST 
THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT IT 
WOULD TAKE A WHILE FOR THE SHOWERS 
TO DIE OUT IN NORTHERN SCOTLAND 
IT IS WET AND WINDY FOR A WHILE 
THE WINDS WILL EASE AND IT WILL 
TURN FARIK CHILLY TEMPERATURES 
DOWN TO FOUR CELSIUS IN THE CITIES 
A TOUCH OF FROST NOT COMPLETELY OUT 
OF THE QUESTION TOMORROW A BIT OF 
BRIGHTNESS TO START WITH 
SHOWERS WILL GET GOING NOTICE SOME 
MORE PERSISTENT RAIN STARTS PUSHING 
IN ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
DURING THE MORNING SOME STRONG 
WINDS ALONG WITH THAT IT WILL FEEL 
PRETTY CHILLY FOURTEEN CELSIUS AT BEST 
IN THE BRIGHTER SPOTS PUT UP THE 
REST OF THE WEEK NOT A LOT BETTER 
BRIGHTER SPOTS IT WILL TURN A 
LITTLE MORE SHOWERY A FARIK CHILLY 
DAY PARTICULARLY IN THE RAIN 
BARELY FOURTEEN CELSIUS WHERE IT IS 
BRIGHTER LATER IN THE WEEK IT 
WILL START TO WARM UP A TOUCH AND 
BECOME BRIGHTER 
A REMINDER OF OUR MAIN STORY THE 
WOMAN HELD CAPTIVE IN A CELLAR FOR 
TWENTY FOUR YEARS AUSTRIAN POLICE HAVE 
ARRESTED HER FATHER AND HE HAS 
ADMITTED HAVING SEVEN CHILDREN WITH 
HER LET ME TELL YOU THAT THE B. B. C. 
NEWS CHANNEL WILL HAVE MUCH MORE ON 
THAT STORY DURING THE COURSE OF THE 
AFTERNOON INCLUDING DURING THE 
NEXT HALF AN HOUR AN INTERVIEW 
WITH A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST THAT 
IS ALL FROM LUNCHTIME TEAM IT IS GOODBYE FROM ME
