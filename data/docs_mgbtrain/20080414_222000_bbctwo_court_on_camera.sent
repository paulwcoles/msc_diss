THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN GRIPPED BY REAL LIFE COURTROOM DRAMAS PLAYED OUT FOR THEM ON FILM AND TELEVISION 
IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE MOST SENSATIONAL TELEVISED COURTROOM DRAMA OF THEM ALL TOOK PLACE IN LOS ANGELES 
THE SIMPSON TRIAL WAS EXPONENTIALLY COVERED LIKE NO OTHER TRIAL 
IN THE HISTORY OF ANGLO SAXON AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE PERIOD 
AND THE PUBLIC APPETITE FOR TRIAL BY TELEVISION REMAINS INSATIABLE 
EVERYONE WHO KNEW THEM KNOWS 
THAT MICHAEL PETERSON HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DEATH 
OF KATHLEEN PETERSON 
SOME SEE THIS DEGREE OF EXPOSURE AS A THREAT TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
BUT IN AN AGE WHERE WE MEASURE THE HEALTH OF DEMOCRACY BY HOW MUCH THE PUBLIC ARE ALLOWED TO SEE 
CAN COURTS AFFORD TO KEEP CAMERAS OUT 
WE LIVE IN AN AGE DOMINATED BY TELEVISION 
COURT IS IN A BUBBLE OUTSIDE THAT WHICH IS VERY DAMAGING FOR THE COURTS DEMOCRACY 
AND THE DECISIONS WE ALL MAKE ABOUT LAW AND ORDER AND SO ON 
TIMESHIFT TELLS THE STORY OF THE CAMERA IN THE COURTROOM 
AND THE EFFECT IT HAS HAD ON OUR IDEA OF JUSTICE 
A MURDER TRIAL IS UNDERWAY IN A NEW JERSEY COURTROOM 
THE PROSECUTION ARE MAKING THEIR CASE TO THE JURY 
UNDER THE SCRUTINY OF A CAMERA 
ON JANUARY TWENTIETH 
OF THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THREE 
ANDRE SIMMONS WAS HOME WITH HIS WIFE 
TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THE RIGHT TO SEE WHAT GOES ON IN COURT IS ENSHRINED IN THE AMENDMENTS 
TO THE CONSTITUTION THAT GUARANTEE FREE SPEECH AND A PUBLIC TRIAL 
TO MANY TELEVISION IS SIMPLY THE NATURAL EXTENSION OF A PUBLIC GALLERY 
THERE IS THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT 
WHICH PEOPLE KNOW GENERALLY IS THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH FREE EXPRESSION 
AND OUR SUPREME COURT HAS INTERPRETED THAT 
FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY 
TO BASICALLY SAY THAT WITH VERY VERY RARE EXCEPTIONS 
AMERICAN COURTROOMS ARE OPEN TO EVERYONE 
IN BRITAIN THE STRICT SUB JUDICE LAW MEANS THE MEDIA CANNOT REPORT DETAILS OF AN ACTIVE COURT CASE 
IN AMERICA IT'S DIFFERENT 
IN AMERICA THE SUB JUDICE LAWS ARE VERY VERY WEAK 
PEOPLE CAN SPECULATE ABOUT COURT CASES 
THEY CAN SAY OR DO THINGS IN NEWS PROGRAMMES 
BEFORE DURING AND AFTER A COURT CASE 
THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL IN BRITAIN 
IF THE EDITOR OF B. B. C. NEWS DID WHAT THE EDITOR OF FOX NEWS DOES EVERY SINGLE DAY 
HE WOULD BE IN JAIL 
WHEN YOU GOT OUT THERE 
YOU INDICATE THAT THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE BODY 
YES THERE WERE O. K. YOU 
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF FILM AND TELEVISION 
THE AMERICAN MEDIA ENJOYED EXTRAORDINARY FREEDOMS IN THE COURTROOM 
AND WERE QUICK TO EXPLOIT THEM IN PURSUIT OF A STORY 
EVEN IF IT MEANT JEOPARDISING THE DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL 
SINCE THE COUNTRY STARTED THERE WERE ALWAYS BIG TIME TRIALS THAT 
DOMINATED WHATEVER THE VERSION OF WHAT WAS TABLOID MEDIA AT THE TIME 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE REPORTERS DESCENDED ON ANOTHER NEW JERSEY COURTROOM FOR A TRIAL WITH ALL THE INGREDIENTS 
THE TABLOID MEDIA DESIRED KIDNAP 
MURDER AND CELEBRITY 
DIDN'T YOU LIE AT ALL TIME AND TIME AGAIN DIDN'T YOU LIE I DID NOT 
YOU DID NOT NO 
CHARLES LINDBERGH WAS AN AMERICAN HERO WHO BROKE AVIATION RECORDS IN HIS PLANE THE SPIRIT OF SAINT LOUIS 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY TWO HIS INFANT SON WAS KIDNAPPED 
HELD TO RANSOM AND LATER FOUND DEAD 
THERE WAS A MANHUNT FOR THE KILLER 
AND GERMAN IMMIGRANT BRUNO HAUPTMANN WAS ARRESTED 
YOU HAD NEW TECHNOLOGY AS IN YOU COULD FILM THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME 
AND A PRETTY MUCH OPEN PLAYING FIELD PEOPLE COULD DO PRETTY MUCH WHAT THEY LIKED 
THE RESULT WAS THE INEVITABLE SCRUM 
OVER ONE HUNDRED REPORTERS CRAMMED INTO THE TINY COURTROOM 
AND COMPETED FOR SPACE 
WITH THE CAMERAS 
YOU HAD THESE ENORMOUS TRIPODS 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COURTROOM 
OBSCURING VIEWS OF WITNESSES BY SPECTATORS 
TO SOME EXTENT BY JURORS ER LARGE CABLES' 
SNAKING THROUGH THE COURTROOM 
I MEAN THE COURTROOM WAS DOMINATED BY THESE AT THE TIME 
TECHNOLOGICAL FEATURES THAT ALLOWED FOR THE RECORDING BY MOTION PICTURE CAMERAS 
AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THE PROSECUTOR IN THE CASE AND OTHERS AS WELL 
PLAYED TO THE CAMERA 
HE WANTED THAT MONEY SO HE COULD AS HE DID 
LIVE A LIFE OF LUXURY AND EASE SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORK 
HE QUIT HIS JOB THE DAY HE COLLECTED THE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THE VERY DAY 
IN THE CAULDRON OF THE NEW JERSEY COURTROOM 
UNDER THE GLARE OF THE LIGHTS AND CAMERAS 
BRUNO HAUPTMANN WAS FOUND GUILTY 
THE CAMERA WAS EVEN THERE TO RECORD HIS FINAL PLEA FROM DEATH ROW 
BEFORE GOD I AM ABSOLUTE INNOCENT 
I HAVE TOLD ALL I KNOW ABOUT THE CRIME 
THE LINDBERGH TRIAL HAD BEEN A BONANZA FOR THE PRESS 
BUT IT PROFOUNDLY DISTURBED THE AMERICAN LEGAL ESTABLISHMENT 
BRUNO HAUPTMANN'S CHANCE OF A FAIR TRIAL HAD BEEN LOST IN AN ORGY OF CHARACTER ASSASSINATION 
THERE WAS THEREAFTER A BACKLASH BECAUSE PEOPLE VIEWED IT AS A SPECTACLE 
AFTER ALL WHAT ARE OUR COURTS OF LAW DESIGNED FOR IN CRIMINAL CASES THEY ARE TO ADJUDICATE 
THE GUILT OR NON GUILT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CHARGED WITH CRIMES AND IN THAT CASE A CAPITAL CASE 
THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION WERE DETERMINED TO PREVENT A REPEAT OF THE LINDBERGH CIRCUS 
AND IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THEY PROPOSED A BLANKET BAN ON COURTROOM PHOTOGRAPHY 
FOR THE NEXT FORTY YEARS 
THE CAMERAS WERE LOCKED OUT OF AMERICA'S COURTS 
THE AMERICAN COURTS MAY HAVE RELUCTANTLY CLOSED THEIR DOORS 
BUT IN BRITAIN THEY HAD NEVER OPENED 
NOTHING AS VULGAR AS A T. V. CAMERA HAD EVER BEEN ADMITTED INSIDE THEIR HALLOWED CHAMBERS 
THE BRITISH JUDICIARY DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING REPORTED 
AT ALL IN ANY WAY 
IT'S ALWAYS ASTONISHING TO AMERICANS WHO COME HERE 
JUST HOW DRACONIAN THE CONTEMPT OF COURT RULES ARE 
STRICTLY IF A COURT REPORTER GETS EVEN A COMMA WRONG IN THE EVIDENCE 
THEY ARE IN TROUBLE 
ANYONE WHO'S DONE ANY REPORTING HAS SEEN 
EDITORS OR REPORTERS HAULED UP BEFORE THE JUDGE AND TOLD TO BRING THEIR TOOTHBRUSH AND SO ON 
SO THEY DON'T LIKE IT APPEARING IN THE NEWSPAPERS SO THE STEP FROM THAT 
TO ACTUALLY BEING ON T. V. IS A HUGE ONE 
THE BRITISH COURTS AND THE PRESS WERE LOCKED IN A CAT AND MOUSE GAME 
AS UNSCRUPULOUS PHOTOGRAPHERS STOPPED AT NOTHING TO GET PICTURES OF NOTORIOUS VILLAINS IN THE DOCK 
LIKE THE INFAMOUS POISONER DOCTOR CRIPPEN 
RUMOUR HAS IT THAT WAS TAKEN BY SOMEONE CONNECTED WITH MADAME TUSSAUD'S 
WHO HID THE CAMERA UNDER THEIR HAT 
TOOK A PHOTOGRAPH OF DOCTOR CRIPPEN 
THEN USED IT TO MODEL THE WAXWORK 
IT WAS THE FACT THAT YOU WERE SEEING PEOPLE FACING THE DEATH PENALTY 
SENTENCED TO DEATH BECAUSE SOMEBODY SMUGGLED A CAMERA IN 
THAT MADE THE AUTHORITIES THINK 
WE CAN'T PUT UP WITH THIS IT'S UNDIGNIFIED IT'S INAPPROPRIATE 
BRITAIN'S JUDGES WERE OUTRAGED 
AND THEIR RESPONSE WAS TYPICALLY FIRM AND UNCOMPROMISING 
THE NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT BANNED ALL FORMS OF PHOTOGRAPHY IN BRITISH COURTS 
ELEVEN YEARS BEFORE THE LAUNCH OF TELEVISION 
WITH ACCESS TO THE COURTS RESTRICTED TO THE CONFINES OF THE PUBLIC GALLERY 
MOST PEOPLE HAD LITTLE IDEA OF WHAT WENT ON INSIDE 
AND THE MEDIA WERE FORCED TO WORK WITHIN STRICT LIMITS 
UNTIL VERY RECENTLY YOU'D HAVE THE POOR COURT REPORTER STANDING ON SOME WINDSWEPT PAVEMENT 
OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM TRYING TO SUM UP A DAY'S EVIDENCE IN THIRTY SECONDS 
ALL THEY'D HAVE TO ILLUSTRATE THE POINT 
WERE HURRIED SHOTS OF PEOPLE GOING TO AND FROM COURT AND THOSE APPALLING SKETCHES 
THE COURTROOM SKETCH ARTIST HAS HAD TO TRY AND REMEMBER WHAT PEOPLE LOOK LIKE RUN OUT 
IN FIFTEEN MINUTES WHACK SOMETHING TOGETHER WHICH RESEMBLES SOMETHING BY MY NINE YEAR OLD 
IT'S HARDLY SURPRISING THEN 
THAT BRITISH VIEWS OF JUSTICE OWE MORE TO WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE ON T. V. 
COURTROOM DRAMA IMPORTED FROM AMERICA 
THIS ISN'T A COURT OF JUSTICE BUT OF MOCKERY MR. BARNES 
JUSTICE IS GOING TO BE SERVED I'M TAKING THE LAW INTO MY OWN HANDS 
THE SPECTACLE OF A TRIAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN ATTRACTIVE TO THE PUBLIC 
AND ONE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S A DRAMATIC PROCESS 
I OBJECT YOUR HONOUR 
T. V. DRAMA'S GREAT BUT IT'S NOT A METHOD OF SERIOUS RECORD WE HAVE PEOPLE GROWING UP 
WHOSE ONLY KNOWLEDGE OF COURT IS FROM A VERY ABBREVIATED TELEVISION DRAMA OR NEWS 
ORDER IN THE COURT 
A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE IS IF YOU ASK ALMOST ANY SCHOOLCHILD IN BRITAIN 
ABOUT COURTS THEY'LL TALK ABOUT THE JUDGE AND HAMMER GAVEL WE DON'T HAVE GAVELS IN BRITISH COURTS 
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT WHERE HAVE THEY GOT THAT FROM FROM COMEDY SHOWS ON AMERICAN COURT T. V. 
MOTION GRANTED 
COURT WILL RECESS FOR THIRTY MINUTES THANK YOU 
WHEN ONE WATCHES SOME OF THE THINGS IN AN AMERICAN COURTROOM 
ONE CAN'T HELP AS AN ENGLISH BARRISTER 
BUT WINCE THEY DO IT DIFFERENTLY OVER THERE 
THIS IS ONE JURY THAT ISN'T FIXED 
IN AMERICA THE ADVOCACY LIVE IN FAR MORE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IF YOU LIKE THEY CAN WALK AS THEY TALK 
IN SOME STATES IN AMERICA THEY CAN ACTUALLY EYEBALL THE JURY WITHIN A FEW INCHES OF THE FACE 
WHEN THEY'RE ADDRESSING THEM 
DID MURDER HER HUSBAND WHILE IN THE FULL POSSESSION OF HER FACULTIES 
IN OUR SYSTEM WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO WALK 
WE WEAR GOWNS WE WEAR WIGS WHICH HIDE OUR FLAMBOYANCY IF INDEED WE HAD ANY 
HOW DOES THE DEFENDANT PLEAD 
COURTROOM DRAMA WOULD PROVE JUST AS POPULAR IN THE TELEVISION AGE 
DESPITE CONTINUED RESISTANCE TO CAMERAS INSIDE COURT 
BUT BY THE SIXTIES THERE WERE SIGNS IN AMERICA AT LEAST 
THAT EVEN THE LEGAL ESTABLISHMENT WAS BEGINNING TO MOVE WITH THE TIMES 
NOEL CANNON LIKES OUTRAGEOUS CLOTHES LARGE POLICEMEN AND FAST DRIVES ALONG CALIFORNIAN FREEWAYS 
THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE TO THIS SEEMINGLY DIZZY BLONDE 
AND IT'S THIS THAT GIVES AWAY THE REAL IDENTITY OF NOEL CANNON 
EVERYONE RISE PLEASE IN PRIDE OF OUR COUNTRY AND THE PRINCIPLES FOR WHICH IT STANDS 
DIVISION FIFTY THREE OF THE MINUTES 
RECORDED IN THE LOS ANGELES JUDICIAL DISTRICT THE HONOURABLE NOEL CANNON RESIDING BE SEATED BEFORE THE LORD 
PEOPLE VERSUS LOCKES HARRY LOCKES 
BY THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES A FEW ENTERPRISING AMERICAN BROADCASTERS 
BEGAN TO CHALLENGE THE INFORMAL BAN ON CAMERAS IN COURTROOMS 
FLORIDA LED THE WAY 
AND AMERICAN TELEVISION VIEWERS BECAME ARMCHAIR JURORS IN REAL LIFE TRIALS 
YOU KNOW POLYGRAPH EXAMINATIONS ARE NOT TO BE REFERRED TO AT A CRIMINAL COURT OF THIS STATE THAT IS 
AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO ONE AMERICAN TRIAL HAD THE BOX OFFICE APPEAL 
TO CROSS THE ATLANTIC AND GRIP BRITISH VIEWERS AS WELL 
IT HAD ALL THE INGREDIENTS OF A THRILLER 
FEUDING FAMILIES JEALOUSY AND INHERITANCE 
AND A GENUINE ARISTOCRAT IN THE DOCK 
CLAUS VON BULOW 
VON BULOW'S WIFE SUNNY 
HAD SLIPPED INTO A COMA IN MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES 
AND INCRIMINATING HYPODERMIC NEEDLES HAD BEEN FOUND IN HIS CASE 
THIS INGENIOUS ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF HER HUSBAND CLAUS VON BULOW 
TO TERMINATE HER LIFE TO MURDER HER 
BY SECRETLY INJECTING HER WITH A DRUG CALLED INSULIN 
THE TRIAL PRODUCED A HOST OF CHARACTERS A CASTING DIRECTOR WOULD DREAM OF THE MAID 
THERE WAS ABSOLUTE NO HOPE 
THE STEPSON 
THE FIERY ATTORNEY 
ONE OF HONOUR AND ONE OF INNOCENCE 
THE MEDIA MADE CELEBRITIES OF THE TRIAL'S PROTAGONISTS 
AND SET A TROUBLING PRECEDENT 
ONCE A TRIAL IS TELEVISED 
IT BECOMES AUTOMATICALLY A CELEBRITY TRIAL 
AND YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF CASES' 
YOU HAVE THE O. J. SIMPSON CASE AND NOW THE MICHAEL JACKSON CASE 
IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT WAS ALREADY A CELEBRITY 
BUT IT'S ALMOST IRRELEVANT BECAUSE IN THE OTHERS 
THE UNKNOWN DEFENDANT THE BRITISH NANNY LOUISE WOODWARD 
CLAUS VON BULOW THEY BECOME HUGE CELEBRITIES 
THEY JUST BECOME LIKE DRAMATIC CHARACTERS 
AND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS THAT 
THE COLDNESS THE CALLOUSNESS THAT WE BRING TO MOST OF THE PEOPLE WE WATCH ON SCREEN 
VON BULOW WAS FOUND GUILTY OF ATTEMPTED MURDER 
BUT HIS CONVICTION WAS LATER DRAMATICALLY OVERTURNED ON APPEAL 
A TWIST THAT PROMPTED HOLLYWOOD TO CONFIRM VON BULOW'S NEW FOUND CELEBRITY STATUS 
BY TURNING HIS STORY INTO A BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE 
THE VON BULOW TRIAL HAD DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE WAS AN UNTAPPED AUDIENCE FOR REAL LIFE COURTROOM DRAMA 
YET UNTIL THE NINETEEN NINETIES ONLY SELECTED TRIALS MADE IT TO T. V. 
ONE MAN WANTED TO CHANGE THAT BY CREATING A CHANNEL ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO COURTROOM COVERAGE 
HIS NAME WAS STEVEN BRILL 
AND HE HAD THE IDEA IN THE BACK OF A CAB 
I HEARD THIS LITTLE SOUND BITE ON THE RADIO IN THE CAB 
THAT WAS THE PROCEEDINGS OF SOME TRIAL IN NEW YORK 
THEY'D JUST STARTED AN EXPERIMENT ALLOWING AUDIO VISUAL COVERAGE 
IT HIT ME LIKE THAT I SAID THAT'S HOW TO DO IT THE WAY TO EXPLAIN THE LEGAL SYSTEM 
TO PEOPLE IS TO SHOW IT TO THEM AND IT'S ALWAYS DRAMATIC 
TRIALS ARE ALWAYS DRAMATIC ESPECIALLY LIVE ONES BECAUSE 
THEN THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE BORING PLACES 
THE CABLE TELEVISION REVOLUTION MEANT THERE WAS AMPLE SPACE FOR A CHANNEL DEDICATED TO THE LAW 
BRILL JUST HAD TO CONVINCE THE COURTS 
THE CASE I MADE WAS THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS BETTER THAN PEOPLE THINK 
AND YOU OUGHT TO LET 'EM SEE IT 
AS OPPOSED TO LET LAWYERS STAND ON THE COURTHOUSE STEPS AND TALK ABOUT THE CASE 
WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY 
CAMERAS WERE FAR LESS OBTRUSIVE THAN IN THE LINDBERGH DAYS 
WITH THE BLESSING OF AMENABLE JUDGES COURT T. V. MOVED IN 
ALL THAT REMAINED WAS HOW TO TELL VIEWERS WHAT THEY WERE SEEING 
BRILL'S VISION WAS PARTLY INSPIRED BY THE WAY AMERICAN TELEVISION COVERED SPORT 
THERE'S A LOT IN TERMS OF SPORT'S COVERAGE 
IN THE SENSE THAT YOU WANNA EXPLAIN THE PLAY BY PLAY 
THERE'S A TRICK TO THROWING A SLIDER IF YOU'RE A BASEBALL PITCHER 
HIS SLIDER SEEMS TO BE WORKING TONIGHT NO IT'S NOT WORKING 
OR HE LOOKS TIRED 
YOU WANNA EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE 
WHAT'S GOING ON 
LAUNCHED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE COURT T. V. WAS A SUCCESS 
THEY'RE NOT ACTORS PRETENDING 
THESE ARE LIVE PEOPLE WITH REAL EMOTIONS 
AND AS MANY OF AMERICA'S COURTROOMS BECAME FAVOURABLY DISPOSED TO T. V. COVERAGE 
THE CHANNEL WAS ABLE TO ILLUMINATE THE WORKINGS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM FOR A GROWING AUDIENCE 
OUR VALUES THEN AT COURT T. V. WERE NOT ON ENTERTAINMENT 
WE WERE TRYING TO INFORM PEOPLE 
IF WE COULD PACKAGE IT IN A WAY WITH GOOD GRAPHICS AND ARTICULATE ANCHORS 
SO THAT THEY MIGHT WATCH THAT'S GOOD 
I THINK THAT THERE'S NOT ANY QUESTION THAT TELEVISING TRIALS 
WHETHER IT'S ON COURT T. V. OR THE OTHER NETWORKS IN THE U. S. A. 
HAS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE 
IN HOW MUCH THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS 
THE COURT SYSTEM 
NOW THEY ALWAYS LIKE WHAT THEY SEE 
AND SOMETIMES 
THE COURTS DON'T WORK VERY WELL 
AND THEY GET TO SEE THAT 
AND SO IT MAY NOT HAVE IN EVERY CASE 
ENHANCED PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM 
BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION THAT IT HAS ENHANCED THE PUBLIC'S UNDERSTANDING OF IT 
IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM WOULD FACE ITS MOST DAUNTING TEST 
CAMERAS WERE ALLOWED INTO A LOS ANGELES COURTROOM 
TO FILM A TRIAL THAT WOULD HAVE SEISMIC REPERCUSSIONS FOR THE AMERICAN JUSTICE SYSTEM 
AND THE WAY THE MEDIA REPORTED IT 
ON TWELFTH JUNE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND HER FRIEND RON GOLDMAN WERE BRUTALLY STABBED TO DEATH 
DAYS LATER AN ARREST WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR NICOLE'S EX HUSBAND 
A FORMER AMERICAN FOOTBALL ICON AND BIT PART MOVIE STAR 
O. J. SIMPSON 
POLICE PURSUED THE STAR IN A BIZARRE LOW SPEED CHASE AS FRIENDS BEGGED HIM TO SURRENDER 
IN JESUS' NAME THIS IS NOT FAIR WE LOVE YOU MAN 
FINALLY O. J. SIMPSON WAS ARRESTED 
THERE WERE LOTS OF REASONS WHY THAT WAS GOING TO CAPTURE PUBLIC ATTENTION 
BECAUSE IT WAS 
PERHAPS OUR BIGGEST CELEBRITY UP TO THAT POINT 
WHO HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER 
IT WAS A BLACK MAN 
AND A BEAUTIFUL WHITE WOMAN 
O. J. WAS NOT JUST A SPORT'S HERO 
AND A LEGENDARY SPORT'S HERO 
BUT HE WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN ATHLETE 
TO CROSS OVER IN A BIG WAY 
TO DOING TELEVISION COMMERCIALS 
TO BEING A TELEVISION COMMENTATOR 
TO APPEARING AS A MOVIE STAR 
SO THIS WAS GONNA BE A BIG CASE 
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THE PRESS SCENTED AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY 
ANYTHING AND ANYONE TO DO WITH THE O. J. CASE 
WAS FAIR GAME 
REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT TO HAVE A FAIR AND DIGNIFIED PROCEEDING 
WITH THAT KIND OF PUBLICITY 
IT WAS LIKE BEING IN THE EYE OF A HURRICANE 
THE TRIAL ITSELF BEGAN IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
AND THE COURTROOM CAMERA WOULD RECORD EVERY MOMENT 
IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ALL INVOLVED THAT THE O. J. SIMPSON TRIAL WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT 
FAR BEYOND THE CONFINES OF THE COURTROOM 
THOSE WHO SAY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ITSELF IS ON TRIAL MAY BE CORRECT IN THAT OBSERVATION 
WHAT MOST CONCERNED THE PROTAGONISTS IN THE CASE WAS THE EFFECT THE CAMERAS WOULD HAVE 
ON THOSE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN DETERMINING OJ'S GUILT OR INNOCENCE 
WE HAD WITNESSES WHO WERE PAID LOTS OF MONEY FOR THEIR STORY 
BEFORE THEY EVEN TESTIFIED WHICH RUINED THEM AS WITNESSES 
WE LOST MAYBE FIVE OR SIX JURORS DURING THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL 
BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL CONTACT WITH OTHERS BOOK DEALS ETC 
AND THEY WERE SEQUESTERED 
FOR SOME THE COURTROOM WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A CASTING COUCH 
AND THE MEANS OF LAUNCHING A HOLLYWOOD CAREER 
BRIAN B. R. I A N 
KATO K. A T. O. 
YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT ONCE SOMEONE GOT INTO THAT WITNESS BOX 
THEY WERE GONNA BE ABLE TO WRITE A BOOK 
THEY WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE FOR A FEW MONTHS TO A YEAR 
A T. V. CAREER IN WHICH THEY APPEARED ON OTHER SHOWS 
I REMEMBER KATO KAILIN WHO CURIOUSLY HAD A DOG ALSO CALLED KATO 
WHICH WAS A DETAIL THAT NO DRAMATIST OR NOVELIST WOULD HAVE DARED INVENT 
BUT HE BECAME A HUGE CELEBRITY 
IS THAT WHAT HE SAID SHE WAS GREAT UH HUH 
YES YES SHE WAS GREAT YOU HAVE TO SAY YES OR NO 
BECAUSE THIS LADY DOES NOT HAVE A BUTTON FOR UH HUH O. K. 
YOU SHOULD GET ONE 
THE ATTORNEYS IN THE SIMPSON TRIAL LIKE PROSECUTOR MARCIA CLARK AND DEFENCE COUNCIL JOHNNY COCHRAN 
WERE WELL AWARE THAT THE PRESENCE OF A CAMERA IN THE COURTROOM 
MEANT THAT THEY WERE MAKING A CASE NOT JUST TO THE JURY 
BUT TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 
DO YOU THINK THAT MR. BROWN IS GONNA STOP IT 
DO YOU THINK THE DA'S OFFICER IS GONNA STOP IT 
DO YOU THINK WE CAN STOP IT BY OURSELVES 
YOU HAD PROBABLY EVERY PERFORMER IN THAT TRIAL 
AND BY PERFORMER I MEAN WITNESS JUDGE JURORS 
AND THE ATTORNEYS IN SOME WAY OR OTHER 
ACT DIFFERENTLY THAN THEY WOULD HAVE ACTED 
HAD CAMERAS NOT BEEN PRESENT 
WHY SHOULD A LAWYER 
OR A JUDGE BE ABOVE THE SIREN CALL 
OF WHAT PLAYS ON THE SIX OR ELEVEN O'CLOCK NEWS AT NIGHT 
WHEN THESE LAWYERS ARRIVED 
YOU'D HAVE THE PRESS MOB SHOUTING QUESTIONS AT THEM 
YOU'D HAVE THE CAMERAS CROWDING IN THEIR FACE 
IT WAS ALL A BIT OF A GAME 
THEY ENTERED INTO IT IF THEY HAD WANTED TO THEY COULD HAVE PROBABLY SLEPT IN THE BACK OF THE COURT 
OR NOT EVEN COME OUT AT LUNCHTIME 
THE INTENSE PUBLICITY SURROUNDING THE CASE ENSURED THE TRIAL DRAGGED ON FOR WEEKS 
THE LONGER THE ATTORNEYS ARGUED 
THE MORE THE EVIDENCE BECAME BOGGED DOWN IN DETAIL 
THE IDEA THAT MARCIA CLARK WAS ALLOWED A WEEK TO EXAMINE THE MEDICAL EXAM 
AND BARRY SCHECK A FRIEND OF MINE WAS ALLOWED TEN DAYS TO CROSS 
I MEAN THAT'S JUST LOONY TUNES THAT'S 
THAT'S NONSENSE THAT'S A JOKE THAT'S NOT A WAY TO RUN A TRIAL 
BUT THE CAMERA DIDN'T MAKE THAT HAPPEN 
AND I DON'T EVEN THINK BARRY TOOK ALL THE TIME HE TOOK BECAUSE THE CAMERA WAS THERE 
HE TOOK ALL THAT TIME BECAUSE HE KNEW HE COULD WEAR THE JURY DOWN 
MAKE 'EM SO BORED AND SO CONFUSED 
THAT THEY'D FORGET EVERYTHING THIS MEDICAL EXAMINER WAS SAYING WHICH APPARENTLY THEY DID 
THE TRIAL DID TAKE LONGER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE IN PART I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE JUDGE WAS CONTENDING 
WITH THIS INCREDIBLE ONSLAUGHT OF PUBLICITY 
WE HAD LOTS OF DELAYS BECAUSE OF JUROR AND WITNESS PROBLEMS 
PUBLICITY RELATED DELAYS 
THAT JUST DRAGGED THAT OUT AND MADE IT ALL EVEN WORSE 
AFTER A MARATHON ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE DAY TRIAL 
THE JURY RETURNED ITS VERDICT 
WE THE JURY IN THE ABOVE ENTITLED ACTION 
FIND THE DEFENDANT ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON NOT GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF MURDER 
AND VIOLATION OF PENAL CODE 
IT WAS A VERDICT BORNE OUT OF AMERICA'S VOLATILE RACIAL POLITICS 
SOMETHING THE DEFENCE WERE QUICK TO EXPLOIT 
IT WAS EASY TO FORGET THAT TWO INNOCENT PEOPLE HAD LOST THEIR LIVES 
AS SOON AS THE TRIAL WAS OVER 
THE INQUEST BEGAN 
WAS IT A NIGHTMARE EXAMPLE OF THE WORST EXCESSES THAT MIGHT OCCUR 
WHEN A TRIAL WAS SUBJECTED TO THE HARSH LIGHT OF THE WORLD'S MEDIA 
OR WAS IT AN ABERRATION 
A TAINTED PRODUCT OF TIME PLACE AND PERSONALITIES 
THE THING THAT WAS BAD ABOUT THE O. J. SIMPSON TRIAL WASN'T THAT AMERICA GOT TO SEE IT 
IT WAS THAT AMERICA GOT TO SEE A SYSTEM THAT DIDN'T WORK 
AND THAT MADE THE PEOPLE WHO OPERATE THE SYSTEM 
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE 
WHILE WE WERE DOING O. J. WE WERE CONCENTRATING ON LOTS OF OTHER CASES FOR EXAMPLE 
I VAGUELY REMEMBER THERE WAS A MURDER CASE THAT WAS A BIG DEAL 
IN THE STATE AND THE TOWN IN SOME PLACE LIKE WEST VIRGINIA 
A LURID MURDER CASE THAT STARTED AND ENDED 
IN THE FIRST WEEK OF THE O. J. SIMPSON CASE 
AND THE JUDGE RAN A PERFECT TRIAL 
YOU WATCHED IT AND YOU FELT THE VERDICT WAS RIGHT 
EVERYBODY FELT WELL TREATED 
AND THE CONTRAST FOR OUR VIEWERS 
WAS THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON WRONG IN THE O. J. SIMPSON CASE 
THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO DO WITH CAMERAS COS THEY WERE WATCHING THEY HAD A CAMERA IN THIS COURT AND THE NEXT 
WHERE DID THINGS GO WRONG 
THE O. J. SIMPSON TRIAL MAY HAVE BEEN THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE 
WHEN STEVE BRILL SOLD COURT T. V. TO TIME WARNER IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
BUT IT HAD HELPED SPAWN A TELEVISION CULTURE OF ENDLESS RUMOUR AND SPECULATION 
TRIAL COVERAGE HAD BECOME MORE ABOUT STIRRING CONTROVERSY THAN CLARIFIED POINTS OF LAW 
YOU DEVELOPED A COTTAGE INDUSTRY OF LEGAL PUNDITS 
I THINK THAT THAT'S NOT BEEN HANDLED WELL AT ALL 
WE HAVE C. SPAN HERE IN THE U. S. A. WHERE YOU TELEVISE THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE AND 
CERTAIN EXTENDED EVENTS AND IT'S A MORE DIGNIFIED KIND OF COMMENTARY 
ON THE INSTITUTIONS 
NOBODY GETS SOUND BITED THERE ARE NO FOOD FIGHTS 
BUT WHAT EVERYBODY BEGAN TO SEE 
IS THAT IF YOU BROUGHT LAWYERS ON THE AIR 
WHO ALL DISAGREED WITH EACH OTHER AND HAD THESE REALLY GOOD FIGHTS 
DISAGREEING ABOUT THINGS THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT COS THEY WEREN'T IN THE COURTROOM 
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS WOMAN OR THIS LAWYER IS OVER THE TOP ALL THIS YOU KNOW PERSONALITY DRIVEN 
AND IT WAS MUCH LESS ABOUT 
LET'S LEARN ABOUT OUR LEGAL INSTITUTIONS 
AND MUCH MORE HEY THIS IS A GREAT STORY 
THE AMERICAN LEGAL ESTABLISHMENT WAS APPALLED BY THE MEDIA CIRCUS AROUND THE O. J. TRIAL 
JUST AS THEY HAD BEEN BY THE LINDBERGH CASE SIXTY YEARS BEFORE 
AND AFTER EVENTS IN LOS ANGELES 
MANY JUDGES RESOLVED TO KEEP THE CAMERAS OUTSIDE 
IT DID NOT HELP THOSE WHO DO THIS FOR A LIVING 
THAT COURT T. V. HAD BEEN INVOLVED 
YOU KNOW THE SIMPSON TRIAL WAS THE BIGGEST THING THEY EVER HAD 
AND AT THE SAME TIME IT LED MANY STATES IN THIS COUNTRY 
TO BAN CAMERAS IN THE COURTROOM 
AND IT CERTAINLY LED EVEN STATES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE PERMIT IT 
LIKE CALIFORNIA TO KEEP CAMERAS OUT 
FOR OTHER HIGH PROFILE TRIALS BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHAT A DISASTER IT WOULD BE 
THE BACKLASH AGAINST COURTROOM CAMERAS AFTER THE O. J. SIMPSON TRIAL 
WAS NOT CONFINED TO AMERICA 
BACK IN BRITAIN IT PUT PAID TO YEARS OF TENTATIVE 
PAINSTAKING EFFORTS TO OPEN UP THE COURTS TO TELEVISION 
IN THE YEARS PRECEDING THE LOS ANGELES CIRCUS 
BRITAIN HAD COME CLOSER THAN EVER BEFORE TO EXPERIMENTING WITH CAMERAS IN COURT 
A NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE REPORT BY THE BAR COUNCIL OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
HAD CONCLUDED THAT THE ABSOLUTE BAN ON CAMERAS WAS NO LONGER JUSTIFIED 
IT RECOMMENDED THAT INDIVIDUAL JUDGES DECIDE WHETHER TO ALLOW 
OR EXCLUDE THEM 
IN SCOTLAND THEY WOULD GO EVEN FURTHER 
IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE PERSEVERANCE OF A GROUP OF FILMMAKERS WON OVER A FORWARD THINKING JUDICIARY 
IN ONE CORNER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AT LEAST 
THE CAMERAS WERE ALLOWED IN TO FILM A LANDMARK SERIES THE TRIAL 
WHEN THE SCOTTISH COURTS 
AGREED TO ALLOW THEIR PROCEEDINGS TO BE TELEVISED 
LORD HOPE WHO WAS THEN THE SENIOR JUDGE IN SCOTLAND 
TOLD US THAT THE REASON THAT HE WAS IN FAVOUR OF TELEVISING THE SCOTTISH COURTS 
WAS THAT PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND 
DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEIR OWN LEGAL SYSTEM OPERATED 
THEY HAD A BETTER IDEA HOW THE ENGLISH LEGAL SYSTEM OPERATED 
BECAUSE THEY WATCHED PROGRAMMES ON TELEVISION DRAMA PROGRAMMES LIKE CROWN COURT 
THE SERIES BEGAN WITH A DEPRESSINGLY EVERYDAY MURDER CASE 
A MAN HAD BEEN BEATEN TO DEATH NEAR A LIVINGSTON HOUSING ESTATE 
HIS BODY DISCOVERED ON A STRETCH OF ROAD CALLED THE LOAN PATH 
A WATCH FOUND AT THE SCENE LED THE POLICE 
TO ANDREW DEACONS 
WHAT I INVITE YOU TO SAY THAT IT POINTS TO 
IS THAT THE ACCUSED AFTER BEATING THIS MAN 
INTO SUCH A STATE THAT HE SUBSEQUENTLY DIED 
HAD BECOME COVERED IN BLOOD 
THE WAY IN WHICH THE SCOTTISH ADVOCATES 
ACTUALLY PRESENTED THE CASES 
WERE PRETTY STOLID IT WASN'T ATTRACTIVE VIEWING 
THE ONE POSITIVE THING THAT COMES OUT OF THE TRIAL IS 
IT SHOWS THAT YOU CAN TELEVISE TRIALS 
IT SHOWS THAT YOU CAN DO SO WITH MINIMUM FUSS 
YOU CAN DO SO WITH THE CONSENT OF THE PARTICIPANTS SO IN THAT WAY 
IT WAS ALSO A LEARNING PROCESS 
NOT ONLY FOR THE DOCUMENTARY MAKERS BUT ALSO FOR THE COURTS 
THE CROWN NEED TO PROVE THE CASE BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT 
THAT SORT OF PHRASE FRIGHTENS ME AS IT'S SUCH A WELL KNOWN PHRASE 
IT'S ON THE TELLY 
AND PHRASES LIKE BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT BECOME A SORT OF GAME 
BUT THEY'RE NOT A GAME THEY ARE IN FACT AT THE VERY BASIS OF OUR SYSTEM 
THE JURY UNDERSTOOD THE DEFENCE ADVOCATE'S CASE BUT THEY DIDN'T ACCEPT IT 
ANDREW DEACONS WAS GUILTY OF MURDER 
BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT THE CAMERAS WERE PRESENT TO WITNESS THE SPEED 
WITH WHICH THE WHEELS OF JUSTICE CAN TURN 
YOU HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF THE CRIME OF MURDER 
AND FOR THAT CRIME THERE IS ONLY ONE SENTENCE THAT I CAN IMPOSE 
THAT SENTENCE IS THAT YOU BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE 
THAT IS ALL 
THERE WAS RELIEF THAT THE FIRST TELEVISED CASE IN BRITISH LEGAL HISTORY HAD RUN SMOOTHLY 
BUT THERE WAS ONE VOICE OF DISSENT 
I THINK IT WAS A VERDICT FOR THE CAMERAS THEY WERE GIVING THE PUBLIC WHAT THEY WANTED TO SEE 
IT WAS A MAJORITY VERDICT AND 
AS FAR AS MY LAWYER TOLD ME IT WAS EIGHTY SEVEN 
SO MAYBE THE CAMERAS SWUNG THAT VOTE THE OTHER WAY 
OR ELSE IT COULD HAVE JUST STAYED THE WAY IT WAS 
EVERYONE WAS SURPRISED DELIGHTED AND RELIEVED 
WITH HOW THE TRIAL WENT IT FELT LIKE A TOTALLY ORDINARY TRIAL 
THAT WAS FOR BOTH PROSECUTION AND DEFENCE AND ANDREW DEACONS 
FACING A LIFE SENTENCE WHICH HE'S COMING TO THE END OF NOW 
OF COURSE HE WASN'T HAPPY MY ARGUMENT WITH ANDREW AND I HAVE SEEN HIM SINCE THE TRIAL 
WAS HIS PROBLEM WASN'T WITH THE WAY IT WAS FILMED BUT THAT HE GOT CONVICTED 
THE TRIAL WAS A PROMISING START 
BUT EVENTS IN LOS ANGELES WOULD CONSPIRE TO ENSURE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE REPEATED 
AS A FIRST STEP I THINK THE TRIAL WORKED VERY WELL 
UNFORTUNATELY THERE WASN'T A SECOND STEP THE TRIAL WENT OUT 
DID WELL O. J. SIMPSON CAME AND BLEW US OUT OF THE WATER 
THE BRITISH PUBLIC MAY HAVE WATCHED THE O. J. SIMPSON TRIAL UNFOLD FROM AFAR WITH MILD CURIOSITY 
BUT IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THEY WOULD GET TO EXPERIENCE TELEVISED AMERICAN JUSTICE THROUGH ENGLISH EYES 
THE FATE OF NINETEEN YEAR OLD AU PAIR LOUISE WOODWARD ENFLAMED PASSIONS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC 
IT FASCINATED 
THE BRITISH AUDIENCE BECAUSE I SUPPOSE 
IT WAS THE CLASSIC TALE OF A YOUNGSTER ABROAD 
A BRITISH YOUNGSTER ABROAD 
FINDING HERSELF IN THE CLUTCHES OF A FOREIGN POWER 
LOUISE WOODWARD HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER 
AFTER A BABY IN HER CARE HAD DIED FOLLOWING A BRAIN HAEMORRHAGE 
IN AN EFFORT TO PROVE HER INNOCENCE 
SHE TURNED TO THE DEFENCE ATTORNEY WHO HAD HELPED CLEAR O. J. SIMPSON 
BARRY SCHECK 
I WAS CALLED IN TO THE LOUISE WOODWARD CASE 
ALMOST NEAR THE BEGINNING 
AFTER SHE WAS CHARGED 
BECAUSE WE KNEW IT WOULD INVOLVE CERTAIN SCIENTIFIC MEDICAL ISSUES 
AND THERE WAS A REAL BELIEF ON THE PART OF A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND 
HOW COULD SHE BE CHARGED WITH THIS IT WAS VERY SHOCKING 
AS TIME WENT ON 
IT BECAME CLEAR TO THE DEFENCE TEAM 
THAT WE WERE DEALING WITH A YOUNG WOMAN WHO DID NOT COMMIT THIS CRIME 
SCHECK BELIEVED HE COULD UNEQUIVOCALLY PROVE LOUISE'S INNOCENCE TO THE JURY 
THROUGH SCIENCE 
BASED ON HARD PHYSICAL EVIDENCE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN 
THIS IS A REASONABLE DOUBT 
THIS IS THE END OF THE CASE 
BUT HE SOON DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULDN'T BE AS SIMPLE AS THAT 
LOUISE WOODWARD HAD BECOME THE HOT TOPIC OF COUNTLESS CHAT SHOWS 
AND THE BARE FACTS OF THE CASE WERE LOST IN A WIDER DEBATE ABOUT CHILDCARE 
IN THE UNITED STATES AT LEAST 
EVERYBODY THOUGHT THIS IS A CASE ABOUT 
MY GUILT AS A PROFESSIONAL COUPLE 
THAT MAYBE IT'S WRONG TO USE A NANNY 
CHEATING OUR CHILDREN OF FULL TIME PARENTING 
AND ON THE OTHER HAND 
WORKING CLASS PEOPLE ARE SAYING OH HOW COULD YOU PUT THIS 
YOUNG GIRL INTO SUCH A DIFFICULT WORK SITUATION 
WHEN SHE WAS PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF THESE KIDS 
AND NEITHER OF THOSE 
CULTURAL ISSUES WHICH SO PREOCCUPIED PEOPLE 
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE REAL ISSUE TO BE DECIDED IN THE CASE 
TELEVISION COVERAGE OF THE CASE 
MEANT THAT LOUISE WOODWARD WAS ON TRIAL IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION 
AND THE ARMCHAIR JURY THAT SAT IN EVERY LIVING ROOM IN BRITAIN AND AMERICA 
WERE URGED TO BASE THEIR DECISION NOT ON THE EVIDENCE 
BUT ON APPEARANCE 
WE FOUND OURSELVES BEING ASKED TO POSTULATE 
AND SPECULATE AS TO WHETHER SHE'D BE GUILTY BY HER POSITION 
BY HER TONE OF VOICE 
BY WHETHER SHE SMILED BY WHETHER SHE CRIED 
I DIDN'T SEE IT AS A PERFORMANCE 
I GUESS MAYBE IT IS THE BRITISH IN ME THAT I'M NATURALLY RESTRAINED 
I DID HOLD BACK WITH CRYING 
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING SO DESPERATELY 
TO TELL MY STORY 
TO TELL WHAT HAPPENED 
THE JURY WERE NOT CONVINCED BY LOUISE'S PERFORMANCE 
GUILTY OF WHAT 
GUILTY OF MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE 
LOUISE APPEALED AGAINST THE CONVICTION 
THE JUDGE UNMOVED BY THE HYSTERIA THAT HAD SURROUNDED THE CASE 
TOOK HER SIDE 
TO HIM SCHECK'S EVIDENCE WAS OVERWHELMING 
AND TWO WEEKS LATER HE MADE AN UNEXPECTED INTERVENTION 
HE REDUCED WOODWARD'S CHARGE TO MANSLAUGHTER 
AND SHE WAS SET FREE 
BACK IN BRITAIN 
LOUISE SPOKE PUBLICLY ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING TRIED ON TELEVISION 
IT KIND OF TRIVIALISES 
WHAT GOES ON INSIDE A COURTROOM WHICH IS A SERIOUS PLACE 
YOU'RE DISCUSSING PEOPLE'S LIVES PEOPLE'S FUTURES 
AND IT BASICALLY TURNS IT INTO A SOAP OPERA 
AND IT TURNS IT INTO ENTERTAINMENT WHICH A COURTROOM SHOULD NEVER BE 
THE THING THAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER ABOUT THE LOUISE WOODWARD TRIAL 
WAS THAT SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY 
IN AMERICA UNDER A FAIRLY ALIEN SYSTEM AS FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED 
IT WAS ONLY BY PRESSURE OF THE FACT THAT HER CASE WAS TELEVISED 
THAT SHE GOT THE APPEAL 
THAT THE MATTER WAS RECONSIDERED PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO COME FORWARD AND SAY 
ACTUALLY THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT CONTROVERTS THE PROSECUTION CASE HERE 
THIS IS PERHAPS A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE AND WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT AGAIN 
AND DESPITE THE BITTER EXPERIENCE OF APPEARING IN A TRAGIC SOAP OPERA 
LOUISE WOODWARD'S BRUSH WITH AMERICAN TELEVISED JUSTICE 
HADN'T TURNED HER COMPLETELY AGAINST COURTROOM CAMERAS 
IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SEE INSIDE THE COURTROOM THEN WHEN A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE DOES OCCUR 
THEY CAN SEE THAT FOR THEMSELVES 
I THINK ON THE OTHER HAND THE WAY IT'S DONE IN AMERICA 
IT'S SEEN FAR MORE AS A FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT 
SO I THINK IF YOU GET THE BALANCE RIGHT IT CAN BE BENEFICIAL AND HELPFUL 
AWAY FROM THE PRIMETIME SENSATIONAL TRIAL 
T. V. CAMERAS HAVE ALSO BEEN PRESENT IN THOSE COURTROOMS WHERE INDIVIDUALS 
HAVE BEEN HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR THE GRAVEST CRIMES OF ALL 
THE CAMERA HAS SHOWN US EVIDENCE OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY 
AND AS IMPORTANTLY 
OF JUSTICE BEING SEEN TO BE DONE 
EVEN A MAJOR TRIAL 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO KNOW THAT JUSTICE HAS BEEN DONE 
AND THEY TEND TO BELIEVE IT MORE WHEN THEY CAN SEE IT 
OR SOMETHING APPROXIMATING TO IT 
AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE NUREMBERG TRIALS AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
FILMED AND SHOWN ON THE NEWSREELS 
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE PICTURES OF SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC 
ON TRIAL IN THE HAGUE FOR WAR CRIMES 
OTHER WAR CRIMES' TRIBUNALS HAVE HAPPENED AROUND THE WORLD 
THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION IN SOUTH AFRICA 
HAVE ALL BEEN TELEVISED AND PEOPLE HAVE COME FACE TO FACE WITH THEIR DEMONS AND THEIR ABUSERS 
ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE ONCE PEOPLE FEEL JUSTICE HAS BEEN DONE AND THE RULE OF LAW WORKS 
THEN JUSTICE IS ACTUALLY SERVED AND PEOPLE HAVE TRUST AND FAITH IN IT 
AND I THINK THAT THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE CAMERA THE UNBLINKING EYE OF THE CAMERA 
SHOWS THAT JUSTICE IS DONE 
WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS JUSTICE HAS ALWAYS BEEN BLIND IN BRITAIN 
YET IN THE INFORMATION AGE WE HAVE INCREASINGLY COME TO RELY ON CAMERAS 
TO PROVIDE US WITH A MEANS OF SEEING WHAT GOES ON INSIDE OUR INSTITUTIONS 
NOT LEAST IN PARLIAMENT 
AND AS THE U. K. CONTINUES TO AGONISE OVER WHETHER TO ALLOW CAMERAS IN ITS COURTS 
ARE WE BEING DEPRIVED OF THE CHANCE TO SEE WHAT ACTUALLY GOES ON 
IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE 
NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN 
THE COURT ACTUALLY GET IT RIGHT 
THE JURY IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL ACTUALLY GET IT RIGHT 
WHEN IT'S GOT WRONG 
PERHAPS SEEING HOW IT WENT WRONG 
WILL AT LEAST IN SOME WAY REASSURE THE PUBLIC 
THAT IT WENT WRONG IN A WAY WHICH PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IT WENT WRONG 
BUT IN THE INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE WORLD OF TELEVISION 
CAN IT EVER BE POSSIBLE TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN EDUCATION 
AND ENTERTAINMENT 
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE FULL COVERAGE 
OF SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT TO DEMOCRACY AS A TRIAL BY JURY 
OR JUST ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WHETHER IT'S TRIALS OR APPEALS 
I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM IS IN THE COVERAGE ITSELF 
IT SUDDENLY DEGENERATES INTO 
HOW CAN WE PRESENT THIS IN A WAY THAT GETS THE BIGGEST RATINGS 
THAT IS DONE A LOT TO UNDERMINE 
THE INTEGRITY OF OUR NEWS GATHERING AND PRESENTING PROCESS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES 
AND IT'S REALLY AT THE HEART OF WHAT CORRUPTS COVERAGE OF OUR TRIALS 
AND BOY THERE'S NOTHING MORE POWERFUL 
THAN THE DESIRE FOR A GOOD RATING 
ORDER IN THE COURT 
SO UNFAIR YOU GET NO SAY OVER WHO'S ON YOUR TEAM BUT YOU GET THE BLAME 
IT'S RIDICULOUS 
TELEVISON EMPHASIS ON WINNERS AND LOSERS WHAT ABOUT IDEAS RESEARCH 
I PUT IN ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT YEAH MATE WE'VE ALL GOT A STORY LIKE THAT 
WHERE ARE WE 
ONE BRAND NEW SERIES TWO REGULAR CANDIDATES 
I AM A WINNER I AM
