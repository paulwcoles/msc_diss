ONE OF THE LOCUMS PUT ALL THIS EXTRA STUFF IN HERE YESTERDAY AS A JOKE 
ONE OF THE LOCUMS PUT ALL THIS EXTRA STUFF IN HERE YESTERDAY AS A JOKE 
NO THE MEETING ITSELF WAS FINE 
I CAN'T COME BACK INTO THE OFFICE 
I FEEL LIKE DEATH WARMED UP 
YEAH O. K. WELL I'LL E. MAIL THOSE OVER TO YOU LATER ON TODAY 
ALL RIGHT BYE 
STEADY NEARLY HAD HIS LEG OFF THEN 
WOULDN'T HAVE DONE MUCH FOR MY PROGRESS 
SORRY I WAS MILES AWAY YOU'VE MADE UP YOUR MIND ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY PRACTICE ALREADY 
NO OF COURSE I HAVEN'T I'M GONNA JUDGE IT ON ITS MERITS 
IT'S JUST A STRAIGHTFORWARD S. T. I. TEST 
IF I WANTED TO WAIT A WEEK FOR THE RESULTS I'D HAVE GONE THROUGH THE N. H. S. 
COME IN 
HI COME IN TAKE A SEAT MISS MATSUDA 
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU TODAY 
IT'S ERIKA 
I'D LIKE SOME SLEEPING PILLS PLEASE 
I'VE BEEN HAVING INSOMNIA FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS 
AND I'M FINE I JUST NEED SOMETHING TO KICKSTART MYSELF INTO A GOOD SLEEP PATTERN 
O. K. YOU DO LOOK A LITTLE TIRED OH DEAR THIS IS A GOOD DAY 
ANY IDEA WHAT'S CAUSING IT 
I WORK HARD AND PLAY HARD 
IT JUST TAKES A WHILE FOR MY MIND TO SWITCH OFF THAT'S ALL YOU GOT PROBLEMS WITH YOUR NECK 
WELL I THINK I TEND TO STORE ALL MY STRESS THERE 
THERE AND IN MY LOWER BACK 
O. K. I'M NOT KEEN ON PRESCRIBING SLEEPING TABLETS AS A FIRST RESORT 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST PLEASE DON'T SUGGEST COUNSELLING 
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING WRONG WITH ME 
LETTING PEOPLE WADE AROUND IN THE PAST FOR YEARS AND YEARS 
IT'S JUST A CASH COW FOR THERAPISTS 
O. K. WHAT I WAS GOING TO SUGGEST WAS COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE 
BECAUSE HOMEOPATHY CAN BE REALLY USEFUL WHEN IT COMES TO INSOMNIA 
SORRY THAT'S EVEN WORSE HOW CAN SOMETHING THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO BASIS IN SCIENCE 
STOP YOUR MIND FROM SCREAMING ALL NIGHT 
SCREAMING IS THAT WHAT IT'S DOING 
IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION 
LOOK I'M REALLY NOT ABOUT TO TAKE AN OVERDOSE OR ANYTHING 
SO CAN'T I JUST HAVE A FEW SO I CAN GET A COUPLE OF NIGHT'S SLEEP 
NOT FOR THE MOMENT I'D LIKE YOU TO TRY TO GET INTO A ROUTINE BEFORE BED 
SO DON'T WATCH T. V. FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS MAYBE READ A BOOK TAKE A BATH 
WRITE A LIST OF THINGS YOU NEED TO DO THE NEXT DAY DRAW A LINE UNDER IT 
HAVE YOU TRIED HERBAL SLEEPING TABLETS USELESS COME BACK IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT 
I JUST CAME HERE FOR SOME SLEEPING PILLS NOT SOME ALTERNATIVE WISHY WASHY AGONY AUNTING 
ERIKA LOOK AT THE RISK OF GETTING MY HEAD BITTEN OFF 
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT TRYING ACUPUNCTURE 
IT'S JUST I REALLY THINK IT MIGHT HELP YOU 
NO THANKS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I DIDN'T SAY A WORD YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WHAT OH FORGET IT WHAT 
ARE YOU O. K. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO PUNCH VIVIEN FOR A MINUTE 
THAT WOMAN IS A STUPID OLD BAT SHE DOESN'T MEAN IT 
ACUPUNCTURE COULD REALLY HAVE HELPED THAT WOMAN REALLY 
YES WHEN SHE CAME IN SHE WAS CHIRPY ENOUGH BUT SHE'S NOT SLEEPING 
SHE'S NOT INTERESTED IN COUNSELLING NOT IN TOUCH WITH HER FEELINGS SHE'S TOTALLY CLOSED RIGHT 
ACUPUNCTURE WORKS WITH THE ENERGY MERIDIANS IN THE BODY AND CAN HELP RELEASE EMOTIONAL 
OH WHATEVER ALL I HAVE IS A VERY STRONG FEELING 
THAT SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT WITH ERIKA ON AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL 
AND THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE CAN'T TOUCH 
OH YOU'RE GETTING ALL INTUITIVE WITCH DOCTORY ON ME AGAIN 
INTUITION IS A BIG PART OF THIS JOB 
YES BUT YES BUT WHAT 
THE BOTTOM LINE IS MEDICINE 
WELL SO FAR SO GOOD 
I LEFT MY INFO PACK BEHIND 
ANYWAY APPARENTLY GROUND FLOOR UNIVERSITY OFFICES 
IT'S ON THE FIRST FLOOR THERE'S WHEELCHAIR ACCESS THOUGH 
THANKS FOR THE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT

BUT AT LEAST RESPECT MY OPINION IF NOT MY EXPERIENCE 
I WASN'T IT'S SIMPLY NOT PROFESSIONAL 
TO PARADE YOUR PETTY MINDED BELIEFS IN FRONT OF THE PATIENTS 
AND I'D REMIND YOU YET AGAIN TO KEEP THEM TO YOURSELF 
I CAN'T HAVE DONE THAT MUCH HARM BECAUSE SHE'S BACK AND SPECIFICALLY ASKED TO SPEAK TO YOU 
PRESUMABLY SHE DOESN'T MIND MODELLING AS A PIN CUSHION AFTER ALL 
RIGHT SHE'S IN THE LADIES NOW 
I ASSUMED YOU WANTED ME TO FIT HER IN YES I'LL SEE HER LAST BEFORE LUNCH 
MR. MARLOWE WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME THROUGH 
DON'T MENTION IT 
RIGHT NOW THAT WE'RE OUT OF EARSHOT OF THE PATIENTS COULD YOU TELL ME HOW THINGS HAVE GOT SO OUT OF HAND 
I MEAN IT'S LIKE A GHOST TOWN OUT THERE WHERE IS EVERYONE 
I'VE TRIED MY BEST I REALLY HAVE 
BUT THE SENIOR PARTNER HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN AND JUST DIDN'T TURN UP ONE DAY 
THEN THE OTHER TWO DOCTORS RESIGNED NOT THAT THEY WERE EVER INTERESTED IN THE FIRST PLACE 
THERE'VE BEEN MANY DIFFERENT PRACTICE NURSES I'VE BEEN JUGGLING LOCUMS WHO NEVER TURN UP EITHER 
THEN THE PRACTICE MANAGER LANDED A JOB IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND LEFT ME HOLDING THE FORT 
I'M SORRY BUT WHEN THAT GIRL STARTED SCREAMING AND HE STARTED THROWING UP OVER THE PLACE BEFORE 
I'D JUST HAD ENOUGH 
JUST CALM DOWN IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT 
WE'LL GET ONTO THE UNIVERSITY AND GET IT SORTED IT'S NOT FAIR YOU'VE HAD TO COPE WITH THIS ALONE REALLY 
THAT WAS DOCTOR EVANS THE LOCUM 
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE FIRST THING 
WELL THAT WASN'T VERY PROFESSIONAL WAS IT DOCTOR EVANS HELLO DOCTOR EVANS 
O. K. SO THE GIRL IN RECEPTION'S BOYFRIEND PHONED 
IT WAS A TOTAL MISUNDERSTANDING AND HE HADN'T DUMPED HER AFTER ALL SO WHO'S FOR A CUP OF TEA 
I'M GONNA DO A VERY SIMPLE TREATMENT FOR YOUR FIRST SESSION 
FIRST YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC 
O. K. MOST PEOPLE JUST FEEL A SLIGHT SCRATCH 
OTHERS FEEL IT MORE STRONGLY 
VERY REASSURING 
HOW WAS THAT 
SORT OF LIKE BEING HIT WITH A TINY HAMMER 
I'D NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT BEFORE 
IF MY MUM COULD SEE ME NOW 
SHE NOT APPROVE SHE'D GO MENTAL 
SHE'S VERY EVANGELICAL DEVIL'S WORK AND ALL THAT 
IS THAT WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND 
WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE AFRAID TO TRY ANYTHING ONCE 
NO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT YOU'RE A LONG TIME DEAD 
O. K. LAST ONE 
WHAT WAS THAT DID YOU FEEL THAT NO CAN YOU TAKE THESE OUT PLEASE 
THE TREATMENT ISN'T FINISHED CAN YOU JUST TAKE THEM OUT 
NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE I DON'T KNOW WHAT ON EARTH IT COULD HAVE BEEN IT WAS NOTHING 
LOOK I'M SORRY I HAVE TO GO 
I'VE GOT A MEETING 
WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO SIGN 
ERIKA I DON'T WANT YOU LEAVING FEELING LIKE THIS 
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE MEDDLED TRYING TO PLAY THE HAPPY HEALER 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH 
THANK YOU 
HELLO YOU ALL RIGHT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST 
FEELS LIKE I HAVE 
WHY WHAT HAPPENED I'M NOT SURE REALLY 
I WAS DOING THIS ACUPUNCTURE TREATMENT ON THAT WOMAN THAT VIVIEN TRIED TO SCARE OFF 
SHE CAME BACK THEN 
IT'S A BALANCING TREATMENT I'VE USED IT LOADS OF TIMES 
BUT JUST AS I PUT THE LAST NEEDLE IN HER HEAD WHICH COMPLETES THE CIRCUIT 
THIS FORCE SWEPT THROUGH THE ROOM 
YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING TOO MUCH HERBAL TEA 
YOU'RE NOT JOKING ARE YOU NO I'M NOT 
AND IT WASN'T A POSITIVE ENERGY EITHER 
IT WAS LIKE A BIG DARK PRESENCE HAD ENTERED THE ROOM 
I KNOW IT SOUNDS A BIT BONKERS I CAN'T QUITE BELIEVE IT MYSELF 
LAST MONTH 
I WENT TO THIS SYMPOSIUM ON CHINESE ACUPUNCTURE 
AND ONE OF THE LECTURERS THERE DID SAY THAT SOME OF THE TREATMENTS CAN BE EXTREMELY POWERFUL 
I THOUGHT HE WAS EXAGGERATING 
BUT I ACTUALLY FELT IT 
EVERY HAIR ON MY BODY STOOD ON END 
WE'VE JUST HAD A DELIVERY THE DOOR SLAMMED SHUT 
COULD HAVE BEEN A DRAFT 
PLEASE JUST LEAVE ME ALONE 
YOU WON'T WANT TO TOUCH THIS PLACE WITH A BARGE POLE NOW 
NO I LIKE A BIT OF RANDOM ANARCHY KEEPS YOU YOUNG 
YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT IF YOU'D BEEN HERE THESE LAST FEW WEEKS 
YOU TAKE THIS JOB REALLY SERIOUSLY DON'T YOU 
OF COURSE 
IT'S IMPORTANT 
WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO BE WAS A NURSE 
WELL IT HAS ITS MOMENTS BELIEVE ME 
SERIOUSLY THOUGH IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO TRAIN 
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T GET IN WELL THEY TOOK ME 
IT REALLY IS A GREAT JOB 
YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT 
MAYBE I WILL 
IT'D BE GREAT IF YOU GUYS DID TAKE THIS PLACE OVER 
YOU'D BE SO GOOD WITH THE STUDENTS 
BE NICE TO HAND IT OVER TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE 
YOU'RE THINKING OF MOVING ON 
NO I JUST PRESUMED 
ESPECIALLY AFTER BEFORE 
O. K. LOOK WHOEVER IT IS THAT WALKS THROUGH THAT DOOR THINKING OF BIDDING FOR THIS 
YOU NEED TO PRESENT YOURSELF AS AN ASSET 
HOW DO YOU EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE POSITIVE ABOUT YOU IF YOU'RE NOT 
YEAH YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE ALL ON YOUR OWN 
FANCY A SANDWICH OR SHOULDN'T I MENTION WITCHES 
HA HA VERY FUNNY NO I'M FINE 
DO YOU KNOW ACTUALLY NO I'M LYING BECAUSE I'M NOT FINE 
I'M TOO SCARED TO GO BACK INTO MY ROOM COS IT'S ALL WEIRD YOU REALLY ARE NUTS 
I KNOW BUT I'VE BEEN LOOKING THROUGH THOSE ACUPUNCTURE BOOKS 
AND IN THE TRADITIONAL CHINESE ONE IT SAYS THAT SOME TREATMENTS CAN RELEASE SUPPRESSED ENERGIES 
HOW CAN STICKING A NEEDLE IN SOMEONE RELEASE ENERGY APART FROM TO SAY OW 
BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT ACUPUNCTURE IS THAT IT WORKS ON THE ENERGY MERIDIANS IN THE BODY 
YEAH YOU'RE GONNA START TALKING ABOUT CHAKRAS AND CHI AND CRYSTALS OH SSHH WOULD YOU 
THE CHINESE BELIEVE THAT ACUPUNCTURE CAN PURGE INNER DEMONS 
NOW YOU REALLY ARE BEING WEIRD 
I KNOW AND I'VE DONE THIS TREATMENT LOADS OF TIMES AND THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE 
BECAUSE THE BACK DOOR'S NEVER BEEN OPEN BEFORE 
BUT THERE AREN'T ANY EXTERNAL WINDOWS IN MY ROOM ARE THERE 
AND I FELT IT LIKE I SAID THE BLOOMING PAPERS FLEW EVERYWHERE 
ALL RIGHT LOOK 
THERE WAS A DRAUGHT AND YOU KNEW MORE OR LESS WHAT THE TREATMENT WAS FOR 
AND THERE IS SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT THAT GIRL 
MAYBE BUT HOW COME ERIKA FELT IT AS WELL THEN 
I DIDN'T MENTION ANYTHING TO HER ABOUT THE TREATMENT AND SHE WAS REALLY UPSET 
SO WOULD I BE IF SOMEONE WAS STICKING NEEDLES IN MY HEAD AND TALKING ABOUT COSMIC WIND 
GEORGE I DON'T MEAN TO TAKE THE MICKEY 
BUT I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING BECAUSE OF THESE TEST RESULTS 
ALL RIGHT WELL MAYBE 
BUT I DO THINK I SHOULD GIVE HER A CALL AND MAKE SURE SHE'S O. K. FINE 
BUT TALK ABOUT THE DRAUGHT AND NOT ABOUT THE LEAPING DRAGON THING 
ERIKA HI IT'S DOCTOR WOODSON 
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A CALL 
HELLO 
ERIKA HI IT'S DOCTOR WOODSON HERE 
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A QUICK CALL AND APOLOGISE REALLY AND EXPLAIN ABOUT THE WHOLE DRAUGHT THING 
APPARENTLY THERE WAS A FIRE DOOR HERE THAT WAS WIDE OPEN 
COS WE HAD A DELIVERY SO THAT KIND OF EXPLAINS IT REALLY 
NOT THE DEVIL'S WORK THEN 
NO BUT I THINK YOUR MUM MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTED 
WELL DON'T WORRY WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN OVER A YEAR ANYWAY 
REALLY IT'S NO BIG DEAL 
WELL THEN YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU'RE SUPPRESSING OR NOT DEALING WITH 
WHY DON'T YOU ASK YOURSELF THAT QUESTION SORRY 
HADN'T YOU BETTER GET THAT 
OH LOOKS A LOT MORE ORDERLY IN HERE 
THIS IS WHAT IT'S USUALLY LIKE WHEN I'M NOT RUSHED OFF MY FEET 
HAVE YOU GOT A SPARE INFO PACK 
I'VE LEFT MINE BEHIND THEY SHOULD BE IN HERE SOMEWHERE 
OH SORRY 
IT WAS NEXT ON MY LIST TO TIDY UP 
WHAT IS IT THEY SAY ABOUT A CUPBOARD REFLECTING THE STATE OF A PERSON'S MIND 
NOW YOU SEE I THINK WITH THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ON THE CAMPUS 
THAT WE'LL BE FINE WITH JUST ONE DOCTOR AND A NURSE 
WE CAN ALWAYS HAVE A CLINIC IN THE SICK BAY 
SURE HI KAREN 
GOD SHE'S DIABETIC 
O. K. THERE'S SOME GLUCOSE SOLUTION IN THE SICK BAY I'LL GET IT GOOD GIRL 
PLEASE JUST STOP FOLLOWING ME 
I CAN FEEL YOU 
IT WASN'T MY FAULT 
PLEASE JUST LET ME LIVE 
ALL RIGHT THEN IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT 
SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME 
YOU WERE QUICK OFF THE MARK I REMEMBER DOCTOR WILSON TALKING ABOUT HER 
SHE'S NOT VERY GOOD AT MANAGING HER BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS 
ONE OF THE LOCUMS PUT ALL THIS EXTRA STUFF IN HERE YESTERDAY AS A JOKE 
NOT VERY FUNNY WHEN YOU HAVEN'T GOT TIME TO BREATHE 
BUT WITH THE RIGHT STAFF AND STRUCTURES IN PLACE IT SHOULD BE PRETTY MANAGEABLE 
OH YES 
IT USED TO BE GREAT 
RIGHT WELL WE'D BETTER GET BACK FOR AFTERNOON SURGERY 
OTHERWISE THE MILL WILL END UP LOOKING LIKE THIS PLACE 
OH I MEANT WHEN WE CAME IN 
OH RIGHT 
YOU KNEW MY MOBILE WAS GOING TO RING DIDN'T YOU NO 
ERIKA WHAT'S GOING ON NOTHING I'M FINE 
NO YOU'RE NOT TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG 
IT'S THE HOUSE O. K. 
THERE'S SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE 
SHE KEEPS MOVING THINGS FOLLOWING ME SHE WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE 
WHO WON'T LEAVE YOU ALONE 
YOU'LL THINK I'M MAD LIKE EVERYONE USED TO NO I WON'T I PROMISE 
IT'S MY SISTER 
I HAD THIS TERRIBLE DREAM ABOUT HER BEFORE SHE DIED 
I KNEW SHE WAS DEPRESSED AND I'D BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS 
I GOT BUSY AT WORK 
I WAS UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE 
AND I EXPLAINED IT TO HER AND I THOUGHT SHE UNDERSTOOD 
GO ON 
THEN ONE NIGHT I HAD THIS DREAM 
JESS WAS RUNNING THROUGH THIS FIELD OF POPPIES 
THE POPPIES WEREN'T RED THEY WERE GREY 
AND I WAS RUNNING AFTER HER TRYING TO STOP HER 
BUT SHE COULDN'T HEAR ME 
SHE JUST KEPT ON RUNNING 
AND THE POPPIES WERE SORT OF PULLING AT MY LEGS 
IT WAS SO VIVID 
I WOKE UP WITH THIS STRANGE ACHE IN MY CHEST 
AND I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING 
I DIDN'T PHONE HER 
I JUST TURNED OVER AND TRIED TO GO BACK TO SLEEP 
BUT YOU COULDN'T HAVE 
SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THAT MORNING 
OH ERIKA I'M SO SORRY 
YOUR PATIENT NOTES DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS 
NO I MOVED HERE TO TRY AND MAKE A FRESH START 
TO GET AWAY FROM THE MEMORIES AND MY MUM 
DID SHE BLAME YOU OR 
OF COURSE ONCE SHE KNEW ABOUT THE DREAM 
EVEN THOUGH SHE NEVER BELIEVED IN ANY OF MY 
IN YOUR WHAT NEVER MIND 
EITHER WAY WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER SINCE 
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT YOU WOULD HAVE AN ANXIETY DREAM ABOUT YOUR SISTER IF YOU KNEW SHE WAS DEPRESSED 
I SUPPOSE 
IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE THAT YOU WOULD THINK THAT JESS IS IN YOUR HOUSE BECAUSE OF THE GUILT 
AND IF YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ANYBODY ABOUT LOSING HER 
THEN THERE'S EVERY CHANCE YOU HAVEN'T GRIEVED HER PROPERLY 
BUT ALSO AND I CAN'T QUITE BELIEVE THAT I'M SAYING THIS 
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT THE WIND IN THE ROOM 
WAS A RELEASE OF THE PSYCHIC ENERGY THAT YOU'VE BEEN REPRESSING 
I'M NOT PSYCHIC I'M NOT 
OH COME ON ERIKA STOP RUNNING AWAY FROM IT IT'S MAKING YOU ILL 
I CAN'T FIGHT IT ANY MORE 
I'M SO TIRED 
I KEEP SEEING AND HEARING HER ALL OVER THE HOUSE ON THE STREET 
I MANAGED TO STOP IT FOR YEARS AND YEARS IT MADE MY MUM SO ANGRY 
BUT SINCE THAT DREAM 
I CAN'T SAY WHAT IT IS OR WHAT IT ISN'T 
BUT IF JESS WAS TRYING TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU 
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT SHE WOULD WANT TO HURT YOU 
NO 
NO SHE WOULDN'T 
SEE YOU GUYS DOWNSTAIRS 
NICE TO MEET YOU 
HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEE YOU AGAIN SOON 
LOOK AT ALL THESE GIGS AT THE UNION BIT MORE LIVELY OVER HERE 
I BET YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO CAN GET US FREE TICKETS 
FINGERS CROSSED WE WIN THE BID THEN 
I'LL SEE YOU LATER 
NO WONDER YOU HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING IF YOU'VE BEEN CARRYING ALL THAT GUILT AROUND 
BEING BRAVE IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT 
I KNOW YOU BAULKED AT THE IDEA OF THERAPY BEFORE 
BUT I THINK BEREAVEMENT COUNSELLING COULD HELP YOU 
I KNOW I WAS A BIT DEFENSIVE BEFORE 
I'M SORRY I JUST COULDN'T FACE IT 
HOW ABOUT NOW I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
I'M GONNA GO 
I'VE ALSO BEEN THINKING I MIGHT LOOK INTO THIS WHOLE PSYCHIC THING 
MAYBE JOIN A CLAIRVOYANT GROUP SEE IF IT IS A LOAD OF RUBBISH OR NOT ONCE AND FOR ALL 
WELL I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT BUT I DO KNOW IT'S ALWAYS BEST TO FACE YOUR DEMONS HEAD ON 
OTHERWISE THEY COME BACK AND BITE YOU ON THE TAIL 
EXACTLY 
DID YOU EVER CONSIDER THAT IF JESS WAS TRYING TO CONTACT YOU 
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO FORGIVE YOU OR HELP YOU MOVE ON 
COME AND TALK TO ME AT THE MILL IN A COUPLE OF DAYS 
I'D REALLY LIKE THAT 
I'D BETTER GET BACK FOR AFTERNOON SURGERY OR MY NAME WILL BE MUD I'LL SEE MYSELF OUT 
THANK YOU 
YOU'RE WELCOME 
I HOPE YOU DO FORGIVE ME 
MUM 
HOW ARE YOU 
SO WHAT DO WE THINK SHALL WE GO FOR IT 
IT'S A BIT SMALL FOR THE EXTRA ADMIN AND AGGRO DON'T BE SO NEGATIVE 
WE CAN RUN IT AS A BRANCH FROM THE MILL AND LIKE I SAID WE CAN ROTATE OVER HERE WITH THE NEW STAFF 
YOU KNOW KEEP IT TIGHT WELL I'M WELL UP FOR IT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PLAN 
YOU'RE JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO THE STUDENT EYE CANDY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
ONCE YOU GET YOUR TEETH INTO THIS WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE YOU RESULT 
CHEEKY WE COULD WORK WONDERS HERE YOU KNOW IT ONLY IF WE WIN THE BID 
O. K. 
LET'S GO FOR IT YES WHY DO I GET THE FEELING WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE THAN WE BARGAINED FOR 
OH 
GET OFF 
WE SHOULD GET YOU TO HOSPITAL 
IT'S JUST A FEW MINOR CUTS AND BRUISES 
AND YOU ARE 
THESE ARE QUITE STRONG DO YOU KNOW WHY YOUR G. P. PRESCRIBED THEM 
MY COUSIN GOT THEM FOR ME 
YOUR COUSIN 
LOOK IF JULIA CAN'T SEE WHAT'S UNDER HER NOSE 
THAT'S HER LOSS NOT MINE 
AND LIKE YOU SAY WHY SHOULD I CARE 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER
