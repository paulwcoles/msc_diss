MANY OF THESE CAMERAS ARE PLACED AROUND THE TIGRESS'S TERRITORY 
IF YOU WANT TO GET TO GET CLOSE TO A TIGER GET AN ELEPHANT 
BUT THESE ELEPHANTS CARRY CAMERAS AND WITH THEM THEY HAVE RECORDED 
THE MOST INTIMATE IMAGES OF TIGERS EVER SEEN 
IN THE LAST PROGRAMME THEY DISCOVERED A LITTER OF FOUR CUBS 
WE WATCHED AS THEIR MOTHER PROTECTED THEM FROM ENEMIES 
WE SAW HOW SHE HUNTED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH FOOD 
SLOWLY THEY STARTED TO ACQUIRE 
THE SKILLS THEY NEEDED FOR LIFE IN THE FOREST 
BUT NOTHING HAD PREPARED THEM FOR THE DAY 
THAT A DANGEROUS STRANGER ARRIVED AT THEIR WATERHOLE 
THE LIVES OF THE CUBS ARE AT RISK 
THEIR MOTHER ISN'T AT THE DEN AND HASN'T BEEN SEEN FOR DAYS 
A LEOPARD IS DRINKING FROM A WATERHOLE CLOSE BY 
LEOPARDS KILL TIGER CUBS 
THE CUBS ARE NOW EIGHT MONTHS OLD AND THEY COULD PUT UP A REAL FIGHT 
BUT A FULL GROWN LEOPARD IS A FORMIDABLE ADVERSARY 
FORTUNATELY IT SEEMS THAT ALL SHE WANTED WAS A DRINK 
WITH THE DANGER PASSED 
THE CUBS HAVE TO DEAL WITH MORE ROUTINE PROBLEMS 
WHAT FOR EXAMPLE IS THE BEST WAY TO GET OUT OF THE DEN 
NOT SO DIFFICULT AFTER ALL 
NOW IS THE TIME FOR PLAY 
KEEPING COOL IS A MAJOR PREOCCUPATION 
DAMP SAND IN A SHADY SPOT IS JUST THE PLACE TO DO SO 
THEY URINATE DIRECTLY INTO THE POOL 
THAT CONCEALS THEIR SCENT FROM PREDATORS 
A PARTICULARLY NECESSARY PRECAUTION WHEN MOTHER IS AWAY 
THE CUBS ARE STILL NERVOUS 
THEY DAREN'T STRAY FAR FROM THE DEN 
THE CREW WITH THE CAMERA ELEPHANTS 
ARE BECOMING CONCERNED ABOUT THE MOTHER'S SAFETY 
AND DECIDE TO GO IN SEARCH OF HER 
METHODICALLY THEY EXPLORE HER TERRITORY 
IN THE CENTRE OF PENCH TIGER RESERVE 
BUT IT'S AN AREA OF AROUND TEN SQUARE MILES 
AND WITHIN IT SHE COULD BE ANYWHERE 
THE ELEPHANTS CAN GET TO ALMOST ANY PLACE 
THAT A TIGRESS IS LIKELY TO REACH 
AND THE CAMERAS CAN BE SWITCHED ON THE MOMENT AN ANIMAL IS SIGHTED 
BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY WERE HOPING TO FIND 
ANOTHER LEOPARD 
A MALE THIS TIME AND NOT FAR FROM THE CUBS' DEN 
THE INDIAN LEOPARD IS NOTORIOUSLY SECRETIVE AND RARELY SEEN 
BUT IN PENCH THEY FAR OUTNUMBER TIGERS 
THEY'RE A REAL THREAT TO ANY TIGER CUBS 
THAT HAVE LOST THE PROTECTION OF THEIR MOTHER 
DESPITE THE DANGERS THE CUBS SPEND MOST OF THE DAY OUT OF THE DEN 
BEING A FOURSOME SEEMS TO GIVE THEM CONFIDENCE 
AT THIS AGE THE TWO BROTHERS AND TWO SISTERS GET ON WELL TOGETHER 
AND RARELY SQUABBLE 
THEY'VE NOW BEEN WITHOUT FOOD FOR MANY DAYS 
AND THEY MUST BE FEELING VERY HUNGRY 
AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THEIR FAVOURITE PREY APPEARS NEARBY 
CUBS AS YOUNG AS THIS HAVEN'T A HOPE OF CATCHING SUCH SWIFT PREY 
BUT THERE'S NO HARM IN TRYING 
IT'S A CHANCE TO TRY OUT SOME OF THE TECHNIQUES 
THEY LEARNT FROM WATCHING THEIR MOTHER 
THEY'RE MAKING ALL THE RIGHT MOVES 
BUT THEY HAVEN'T GOT THE PATIENCE 
CUBS HAVE TO GO FOR LONG PERIODS WITHOUT FOOD 
BUT IF THE MOTHER DOESN'T RETURN SOON 
THEY WILL RAPIDLY LOSE CONDITION 
THE NEXT DAY THE CREW HEAR ALARM CALLS FROM DEER NEARBY 
THAT MIGHT MEAN THERE'S A TIGER AROUND 
SO THE ELEPHANTS SET OFF TO INVESTIGATE 
AS THEY CLOSE IN ON THE CALLS 
THE ELEPHANT CAMS ARE SWITCHED ON REMOTELY 
TRUNK CAM THE FIRST ON THE SCENE FINDS THE TIGER 
BUT IT'S NOT THE CUB'S MOTHER IT'S A MALE 
IF HE'S A STRANGER HE MIGHT WELL KILL THE CUBS 
TRUNK CAM CAN FILM FROM EITHER THE ELEPHANT OR ON THE GROUND 
AND IT MOVES EVEN CLOSER UNDER ITS OWN POWER 
IT'S GOOD NEWS 
THIS IS CHARGER THE CUB'S FATHER AND THEREFORE THEIR PROTECTOR 
HE GAINED HIS NAME FROM HIS HABIT OF CHARGING ELEPHANTS 
BUT NOW HE MERELY WARMS THEM OFF WITH A FEW GROWLS 
A FEARLESS FATHER IS EXACTLY WHAT THE CUBS NEED RIGHT NOW 
HE WILL KEEP AWAY ANY RIVAL MALES WHO MIGHT HARM THEM 
BUT THE CUBS' PROBLEMS ARE BY NO MEANS OVER 
THEIR MOTHER HAS NEVER LEFT THEM FOR AS LONG AS THIS BEFORE 
NEXT DAY THE SEARCH FOR HER CONTINUES 
THE ELEPHANTS SEPARATE AND FAN OUT ACROSS HER TERRITORY 
THEN A BREAKTHROUGH 
FRESH PUG MARKS NOT FAR FROM HER CUBS 
FOOTPRINTS CAN IDENTIFY AN INDIVIDUAL TIGER 
THE MAHOUTS WHO RIDE THE ELEPHANTS 
SAY THESE LOOK LIKE THE CUBS' MOTHER'S 
THEY'RE CERTAINLY VERY FRESH 
AND THERE IS A FEMALE TIGER 
SHE'S SCENT MARKING 
WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS INDEED HER TERRITORY 
BUT ONLY A CLOSER VIEW WILL CONFIRM HER IDENTITY 
SHE IS THE MOTHER 
WHY SHE LEFT IS A MYSTERY 
THE MAHOUTS SAY THAT A STRANGE MALE HAS BEEN SEEN IN THE RESERVE 
AND THINK THAT SHE MAY HAVE LEFT 
TO TRY AND LURE HIM AWAY FROM THE CUBS 
THE FAMILY IS REUNITED 
ALTHOUGH LEAVING THEM WAS ITSELF A RISK 
IT WAS PROBABLY THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS 
LICKING AND GROOMING NOT ONLY HELPS CLEAN THE CUBS 
IT GIVES THEM MUCH NEEDED REASSURANCE 
THE TIGRESS HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB IN RAISING ALL FOUR CUBS 
BUT THEY'RE STILL VERY MUCH AT RISK 
HALF OF ALL TIGER CUBS BORN 
DIE BEFORE THEY ARE A YEAR OLD FROM ONE CAUSE OR ANOTHER 
THE LEOPARD IS BACK 
WILL SHE RISK COMING DOWN FOR A DRINK 
NOW THAT THE TIGRESS IS BACK IN RESIDENCE 
SHE THINKS BETTER OF IT 
AND THEN WE SEE THAT THE LEOPARD HAS HER OWN FAMILY TO PROTECT 
TWO FIVE MONTH OLD CLBS 
SHE LEADS THEM AWAY TO A LESS DANGEROUS PART OF THE FOREST 
TO RECORD THE LIVES OF SOME OF THE OTHER INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST 
THE ELEPHANTS USE OTHER KINDS OF SPY CAMS 
LOG CAM CAN BE PUT ON THE GROUND AND LEFT TO OPERATE BY ITSELF 
IT WILL TURN ITSELF ON WHENEVER ANYTHING LARGE MOVES IN FRONT OF IT 
MANY OF THESE CAMERAS ARE PLACED AROUND THE TIGRESS'S TERRITORY 
AND CAREFULLY POSITIONED 
SPOTTED DEER ARE REGULARLY CAUGHT BY THESE CANDID CAMERAS 
THEY'RE ONE OF THE FAVOURITE FOODS OF TIGERS 
WITH HUNGRY CUBS TO FEED THE TIGRESS MUST FIND A MEAL QUICKLY 
BUT THERE ARE NO DEER NEARBY 
NOW AS SHE SEARCHES FOR PREY THE CUBS OFTEN TRAVEL WITH HER 
THAT WAY SHE CAN VISIT DISTANT PARTS OF HER TERRITORY 
WHERE THE DEER HAVE NOT BEEN HUNTED FOR SOME TIME 
SO ARE LESS ON THEIR GUARD 
SPOTTED DEER OFTEN SHARE LOOK OUT DUTIES WITH MONKEYS 
THAT SUITS BOTH PARTIES 
BUT AT THE WATERHOLE IT'S DIFFERENT 
THERE NOT EVERY MONKEY IS A FRIEND 
LOG CAM REVEALS THAT MACAQUES ACTUALLY CHASE DEER AWAY 
EVEN THE BIGGEST STAGS RETREAT 
WITH THE DEER HAVING TAKEN FRIGHT 
THE MACAQUES HAVE TO RELY ON THEIR OWN SURVEILLANCE SKILLS 
A TIGER SPELLS DANGER 
TWO TIGERS ARE CLEARLY A TERRIFYING SIGHT 
AND FIVE MUST SURELY BE EVERY MONKEY'S WORST NIGHTMARE 
THE SPOTTED DEER HEAR THE COMMOTION 
BUT THE TIGRESS IS NOT PARTICULARLY PERTURBED 
THIS OLD TEAK FOREST TEEMS WITH LIFE 
IF SHE KEEPS MOVING SHE'LL GET LOTS MORE CHANCES 
HERE THERE ARE PLENTY TO CHOOSE FROM 
SHE'S GOT ONE 
TIGERS ARE GENERALLY SAID TO SUCCEED JUST ONE TIME OUT OF TEN 
BUT THIS TIGRESS KILLS ON AVERAGE EVERY THIRD TRY 
SHE NEEDS TO BE GOOD 
HER CUBS HAVE ALREADY GOT HUGE APPETITES 
AND BY THE TIME THEY LEAVE HER THEY WILL WEIGH EIGHT TIMES AS MUCH 
EVEN AT THIS SIZE 
EACH CUB CONSUMES AROUND TWO KILOS OF MEAT AT A SINGLE SITTING 
THE CAMERA ELEPHANTS TAKE A BATH EVERY DAY 
THEY WORK FOR FIVE HOURS AT A STRETCH 
AND THEN THE REST OF THE DAY IS THEIR OWN 
IN THE SWELTERING SUMMER 
THIS DAILY RITUAL BRINGS MUCH NEEDED RELIEF FROM THE HEAT 
THE CUBS ALSO LIKE A COOLING DIP 
BUT THE POOL BY THE DEN IS NOT LARGE 
AND WHEN THEIR MOTHER JOINS IN THINGS CAN GET A LITTLE CROWDED 
IN SPITE OF THE HEAT 
SUMMER IS A GOOD TIME OF YEAR FOR SOME OF THE FOREST ANIMALS 
THESE ARE AMONG THE RAREST 
SLOTH BEARS 
THEY ONLY VENTURE OUT DURING THE DAY IN THE MOST SECLUDED PLACES 
BUT SPY CAM WAS THERE TO RECORD THEM 
THEY'RE FEASTING ON FALLEN BREADFRUIT 
WILD BOAR ARE ALSO PARTIAL TO BREADFRUIT 
MOST ANIMALS FEAR SLOTH BEARS 
BUT NOT APPARENTLY WILD BOAR 
AT LEAST NOT WHEN THERE'S FOOD AROUND 
ALTHOUGH THERE IS PLENTY FOR ALL 
IT'S SOMETIMES NECESSARY FOR THE BEARS TO SHOW WHO'S BOSS 
THE BEAR CUBS ARE WORKING OUT WHERE THEY STAND IN THE PECKING ORDER 
THEY'RE AGGRESSIVE CREATURES BY NATURE 
AND WILL FACE DOWN EVEN THE BIGGEST PREDATORS 
BUT THEY MUST SHOW NO FEAR 
EVEN SO FOR THE YOUNGSTERS 
THINGS SOMETIMES GET JUST TOO MUCH AND IT'S TIME TO RETREAT 
THE TIGERS HAVE MOVED FROM THEIR SMALL AND SHRINKING BATH TUB 
TO A MORE COMMODIOUS BATHING POOL 
A RESERVOIR BUILT BY THE LOCAL PEOPLE 
THAT PROVIDES THEM WITH WATER THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 
IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO COOL DOWN 
THE SAMBAR DEER ARE FEELING THE HEAT TOO 
THE WILD BOAR ALSO ENJOY A MUD BATH 
AND COMBINING A WALLOW WITH A MEAL JUST DOUBLES THE PLEASURE 
MUD BATHING IS CLEARLY ENJOYABLE 
BUT IT ALSO HELPS AN ANIMAL TO GET RID OF TICKS 
AND OTHER SKIN PARASITES 
THE TIGRESS HASN'T YET FOUND THE PERFECT SPOT 
THE CUBS OPT FOR SHADE 
TIGERS ARE ONE OF THE FEW CATS THAT ACTUALLY ENJOY SWIMMING 
AND THEY USUALLY PICK DEN SITES CLOSE TO WATER 
AS THEY TRAVEL AROUND THEIR TERRITORIES DURING THE SUMMER 
THEY MOVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE DRIER PARTS 
TO GET TO THE HUNTING GROUNDS THAT HAVE GOOD BATHING POOLS 
AS JUNE COMES TO AN END THE HEAT BECOMES REALLY HARD TO BEAR 
MIDDAY TEMPERATURES CAN REACH FORTY FIVE DEGREES IN THE SHADE 
BUT AFTER A BATHE THE WATER EVAPORATING FROM THE FUR 
COOLS THE BODY AND BRINGS ENOUGH RELIEF FOR THE ANIMAL TO SNOOZE 
WHEN THE MONSOON FINALLY ARRIVES IT'S NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON 
AS WELL AS BRINGING A WELCOME DROP IN TEMPERATURE 
THE RAINS REPLENISH THE PARK'S DAMNS AND POOLS 
THERE IS GREENERY EVERYWHERE 
THE GIANT TWO METRE WEBS OF GOLDEN ORB SPIDERS HANG BETWEEN THE TREES 
THESE ARE THE BIGGEST SPIDERS' WEBS IN THE WORLD 
THEIR SILKEN GUY ROPES SOMETIMES STRETCH ACROSS SIX METRE GAPS 
THE ELEPHANTS ARE BOUND TO BARGE THROUGH THEM 
THE SPIDERS THEMSELVES HAVE A SPAN AS WIDE AS A HUMAN HAND 
BUT THEY ARE OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO AN ELEPHANT 
THEIR WEB IS STRONG ENOUGH TO CATCH A SMALL BIRD 
BUT THE SPIDERS IN FACT FEED ONLY ON INSECTS 
THE CUBS ARE JUST OVER A YEAR OLD 
AND THEY HAVE AN APPETITE TO MATCH THEIR SIZE 
BUT THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THEIR BEHAVIOUR 
THEIR PLAY NOW INCLUDES MOCK HUNTING WITH MOTHER SERVING AS A TARGET 
THIS IS STYLISED FIGHTING 
IT LOOKS DANGEROUSLY AGGRESSIVE 
BUT THE CUBS KEEP THEIR CLAWS FULLY SHEATHED THROUGHOUT 
MOTHER NEVER TAKES PART IN THEIR FIGHTING GAMES 
BUT INDULGENTLY TOLERATES THE CUBS' BOISTEROUS BEHAVIOUR 
THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRAVELLING 
FIVE NEARLY FULL SIZED TIGERS ON THE MOVE TOGETHER 
IS A RARE SIGHT INDEED 
THEY ARE A FORMIDABLE FORCE 
NOTHING STAYS AROUND TO CHALLENGE THEM 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOW COOLER 
THEY STILL BATHE AT THE HOTTEST PART OF THE DAY 
WATER IS DIFFICULT TO RESIST 
THE CUBS TAKE NO NOTICE WHATEVER OF THE ELEPHANTS 
SO IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET REALLY INTIMATE SHOTS 
FROM THE CAMERA HELD IN THE TRUNK 
PROGRESS THROUGH THE FOREST IS SLOW 
BECAUSE THEY LINGER AT ALMOST EVERY POOL OR STREAM 
THEY'RE NOT ALONE IN RELISHING THE ABUNDANCE OF WATER 
THE LANGUR MONKEYS AND THEIR BABIES 
SEEM TO HAVE NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD 
BUT FOR SOME BABIES DRINKING ISN'T THE MOST COMFORTABLE OF TIMES 
UNLIKE MACAQUES LANGURS ARE THE FRIENDS OF SPOTTED DEER 
THEY SHARE THE TASK OF KEEPING A LOOK OUT FOR THEIR GREATEST ENEMY 
THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE TIGRESS TO MAKE A DETERMINED HUNT 
ONE OF HER CUBS DECIDES TO GO WITH HER TO GET SOME PERSONAL TUITION 
THE REST PREFER TO TAKE IT EASY 
THEY'RE NOW STARTING TO BEHAVE AS INDIVIDUALS 
EACH MAKING IT'S OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IT SHOULD DO 
THE TIGRESS DOESN'T NEED TO LOOK FAR FOR A MEAL 
SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE PARTS OF HER TERRITORY 
SHE HASN'T BEEN HERE FOR SOME TIME 
SO SHE HAS MORE CHANCE OF CATCHING HER PREY OFF GUARD 
THE LUSH UNDERGROWTH GIVES HER PLENTY OF COVER 
HER PREY SEEM QUITE UNCONCERNED 
BUT NOT FOR LONG 
THE CUB HAS STILL TO LEARN THAT THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOUR 
IS NOT WHAT IS NEEDED WHEN MOTHER IS TRYING TO HUNT 
THE LANGUR SENDS A WARNING FAR AND WIDE 
BUT STILL THE CUB DOESN'T CALM DOWN 
THE CUB IS NOW TESTING HIS MOTHER'S PATIENCE TO THE LIMIT 
SHE WARNS HIM THAT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 
THE REST OF THE CUBS ARE CONTENT TO WAIT UNTIL SHE'S CAUGHT SOMETHING 
THAT SHOWS JUST HOW WELL FED THEY ARE 
HER PREY SOON RELAX 
THE POOLS ARE BEGINNING TO DRY 
GAUR THE RARE WILD INDIAN CATTLE 
ARE BIG ENOUGH TO PUSH MOST OTHERS DRINKERS OUT OF THE WAY 
SPOTTED DEER ARE GIVEN THEIR MARCHING ORDERS 
BY THE MORE DOMINANT SAMBAR DEER 
THE MOTHER MAKES ANOTHER START 
BUT SHE'LL HAVE TO GET RID OF HER OVER ENTHUSIASTIC CUB 
THIS TIME HE GETS THE MESSAGE 
THE CUB IS BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND HIS MOTHER'S CHANGING DEMEANOUR 
EVERY POSTURE HAS A SPECIAL MEANING 
WHEN SHE HAS A TARGET IN HER SIGHTS 
NOTHING WILL BREAK HER CONCENTRATION 
SHE HAS TAKEN HER PREY COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE 
SHE BRINGS IT DOWN 
IT'S A SAMBAR DEER 
SHE PARTIALLY THROTTLES HER VICTIM BUT DOESN'T KILL IT 
SHE WILL USE THIS ONE TO GIVE A LESSON TO HER CUB 
THE MOTHER LEAVES HIM TO GET ON WITH IT 
BUT HE IS NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO DO 
THE THROTTLE HOLD IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS HE HAS TO LEARN 
AND HE'S MAKING A GOOD START 
GIVING HALF KILLED PREY TO A CUB LIKE THIS 
SEEMS HEART BREAKINGLY CRUEL 
BUT LEARNING TO DEAL WITH LIVE PREY IS A VITAL STEP 
ON THE PATH TO BECOMING AN INDEPENDENT HUNTER 
THE MOTHER HAS RETURNED TO FIND THE OTHER CUBS 
SHE CAN REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE SHE LEFT THEM 
AND THEY GREET HER WITH HEAD BUTTS 
A GESTURE THAT IS USED BY MANY CATS LARGE AND SMALL 
THE CHASE TOOK HER A LONG WAY FROM HER CUBS 
BUT SHE KNOWS THE FOREST SO WELL 
THAT SHE'S ABLE TO LEAD THEM DIRECTLY BACK TO THE KILL 
BY THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE ROUTE 
THE CUB MEANWHILE IS MAKING THE MOST OF HAVING THE KILL TO HIMSELF 
BY THE TIME HIS BROTHER AND SISTERS ARRIVE 
HE'S STARTING TO FEEL IT'S HIS 
THE CUBS ARE BEGINNING NOW AND THEN 
TO BE AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER 
PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE IS FOOD AROUND 
AS THE NEWCOMERS WAIT THEIR TURN 
THEY DISPEL THEIR FRUSTRATION WITH A GAME OF CHASE 
THE CARCASS IS TOO BIG FOR ONE CUB TO CONSUME ON HIS OWN 
SO EVENTUALLY THEY WILL ALL GET THEIR FILL 
THE CUB PULLS THE CARCASS INTO THE SHADE OF A LANTANA BUSH 
AND THINGS START TO CALM DOWN 
WHILE THE CUBS RELAX THE ELEPHANTS LEAVE THEM 
AND SET OFF TO LOOK FOR OTHER TIGERS 
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THE CUBS' FATHER CHARGER 
IS BACK IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD 
TRUNK CAM SPOTS HIM FIRST 
AND DISCOVERS THAT HE HAS MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY KILL 
THE HIGH VIEW FROM ELEPHANT BACK REVEALS JUST WHAT HE'S EATING 
A SLOTH BEAR 
KILLING A SLOTH BEAR SHOWS JUST WHAT A STRONG INDIVIDUAL HE IS 
BEARS ARE FORMIDABLE ANIMALS 
AND HAVE EVEN BEEN KNOWN TO ATTACK TIGERS 
THE BEAR MUST HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO KILL 
AND PLUCKING IT CERTAINLY TOOK SOME TIME 
FOR THE RESULT LOOKS LIKE A RUG ON THE FOREST FLOOR 
ALTHOUGH CHARGER HAS NOT GONE FAR AWAY 
HE RARELY SPENDS TIME WITH HIS FAMILY 
BUT HIS PRESENCE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD KEEPS AWAY 
YOUNG MALES LOOKING FOR TERRITORY WHO MIGHT ATTACK THE CUBS 
THE MALE CUBS ARE ALREADY BECOMING DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THEIR SISTERS 
BY THEIR MORE POWERFUL BUILD 
THE MALE ON THE LEFT HAS A BROADER HEAD THAN HIS SISTER ON THE RIGHT 
UNTIL NOW THE CUBS HAVE BEHAVED IN A LARGELY SIMILAR WAY 
EVENTUALLY HOWEVER THEIR PATHS WILL DIVERGE 
THE FEMALES WILL EACH TAKE UP A TERRITORY CLOSE TO THEIR MOTHER 
BUT THE MALES WILL MOVE MUCH FARTHER AWAY 
TO FIND AND IF NECESSARY FIGHT FOR TERRITORIES OF THEIR OWN 
FOR NOW HOWEVER BROTHERS AND SISTERS STICK CLOSELY TOGETHER 
THEY STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN 
BOTH SEXES HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT 
THE FEMALES TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM UNWANTED ADVANCES 
THE MALES TO TAKE OR DEFEND A TERRITORY 
AND SIBLINGS MAKE EXCELLENT SPARRING PARTNERS 
IT LOOKS VIOLENT BUT IT'S QUITE DISCIPLINED 
AND NO BLOOD IS EVER DRAWN 
FIGHTING ADULTS USE EXACTLY THE SAME MOVES BUT WITH CLAWS UNSHEATHED 
AND THEN THE RESULTS FROM BOUTS LIKE THIS CAN BE FATAL 
BUT PARADISE DOESN'T LAST FOREVER 
THERE HAS BEEN A DISTURBING REPORT OF A SECOND ADULT MALE 
THE CUBS' PLAY FIGHTING MAY SOON NEED TO BE 
SOMETHING FAR MORE SERIOUS 
THEN AT THE EDGE OF THE CUBS' TERRITORY 
THE STRANGE MALE IS SPOTTED 
HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT USED TO SEEING ELEPHANTS 
TIGERS MAY TRAVEL MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILES 
LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO ESTABLISH A TERRITORY OF THEIR OWN 
SUCH A STRANGER WILL KILL CUBS IF GIVEN HALF A CHANCE 
THE CUBS ARE NOW BIG ENOUGH TO PUT UP A FIGHT 
BUT HAVING A STRANGE MALE AROUND IS NONETHELESS A WORRYING DEVELOPMENT 
TIGERS OFTEN USE DRIED UP RIVER BEDS AS ROADS THROUGH THE JUNGLE 
AND THE FAMILY IMMEDIATELY DETECT 
THAT ANOTHER TIGER HAS BEEN USING THE SAME PATH 
THE FACT THAT IT HAS SPRAYED SO HIGH SUGGESTS THAT THE VISITOR IS A MALE 
THE TIGRESS PUCKERS UP HER FACE 
SO THAT THE SCENT PASSES OVER A SPECIALLY SENSITIVE ORGAN 
IN HER NOSE WHICH ENABLES HER TO ANALYSE THE SMELL 
SPRAYING ENABLES ALL THE TIGERS IN THE DISTRICT 
TO BE AWARE OF ONE ANOTHER'S PRESENCE 
PROMINENT TREES ACT AS MESSAGEBOARDS 
AND AN UNFAMILIAR SCENT IS QUICKLY NOTICED 
SO THE FAMILY KNOW THAT A STRANGER HAS ARRIVED 
IT'S RARE TO SEE SUCH AN INTENSE REACTION 
THE MOTHER OVERLAYS THE STRANGER'S SCENT WITH HER OWN 
TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT SHE'S VERY MUCH IN RESIDENCE 
IN HER EAGERNESS TO SCENT MARK SHE GIVES THE CUB A FACE FULL 
EVERY TREE IS SCENT MARKED IN TURN 
THE TIGRESS LEADS HER CUBS UP THE RIVER BED 
AWAY FROM THE AREA AS FAST AS POSSIBLE 
BUT THAT IS WHERE THE STRANGER WENT 
SHE COULD BE LEADING THEM INTO DANGER 
THERE ARE SCENT MARKS EVEN HERE 
WITH A STRANGE MALE AROUND 
THE ELEPHANT CREW CHECK ON CHARGER THE CUBS' FATHER 
HE SEEMS IN GOOD HEATH 
ALTHOUGH QUITE SUBDUED FOR A TIGER WITH SUCH A REPUTATION 
THEN ON HIS SIDE SIGNS THAT HE HAS BEEN IN A FIGHT 
HIS RIGHT FLANK SHOWS PUNCTURE MARKS 
MOST LIKELY MADE BY THE CLAWS OF A TIGER 
HE ALSO SEEMS UNCHARACTERISTICALLY NERVOUS 
THE TIGRESS AND THE CUBS HAVE MOVED FAR FROM THE RIVER BED 
AND NOW HAVE OTHER THINGS ON THEIR MIND 
THEY HAVE REACHED A PART OF THE TEAK FOREST 
WHERE DEER ARE PARTICULARLY ABUNDANT 
THIS OPEN WOODLAND HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST DENSITIES OF PREY IN INDIA 
THE FAMILY IS FORTUNATE INDEED TO HAVE IT IN THEIR TERRITORY 
BUT WITH FOUR ENERGETIC CUBS TO FEED SHE REALLY HAS TO HUNT 
AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY OTHERWISE THEY WILL START TO LOSE CONDITION 
THE LONG GRASS ALLOWS HER TO GET CLOSE VERY QUICKLY 
AND WITHOUT BEING SEEN 
AS USUAL THE CUBS ARE BEHAVING IN A BOISTEROUS WAY 
THAT IS BOUND TO CATCH THE ATTENTION OF THE DEER 
THEY SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT THEIR MOTHER'S TRYING TO HUNT 
BUT UNKNOWINGLY THE CUBS ARE ACTING AS EXCELLENT DECOYS 
DEFLECTING THE DEER'S ATTENTION AWAY FROM THEIR MOTHER 
SHE STILL HASN'T BEEN SEEN 
FOR ONCE THE CUBS' GAMES ARE A HELP 
THE DEER JUST DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIGERS THERE ARE AROUND 
AT LAST THEIR MOTHER IS WITHIN RANGE 
SHE'S GOT ONE IT'S A SAMBAR 
TIME AND AGAIN SHE PICKS THESE OUT 
THEY'RE BIGGER THAN SPOTTED DEER AND THEREFORE MAKE MORE OF A MEAL 
SHE DOESN'T NEED TO CALL HER CUBS 
THEY SAW WHAT HAPPENED AND IMMEDIATELY STOPPED PLAYING 
SHE MAKES A HALF HEARTED ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL THE BODY 
TO HIDE IT FROM VULTURES AND OTHER SCAVENGERS 
CLEARLY SHE'S INTENDING TO LEAVE IT 
SHE MUST HAVE KILLED THIS ONE JUST FOR HER CUBS 
THE FIRST ON THE CARCASS IS ONE OF THE FEMALES 
AND SHE IMMEDIATELY TAKES POSSESSION 
ONCE AGAIN THERE IS A CHANCE TO PRACTISE 
WHAT IS NEEDED TO BE A HUNTER 
THE LATER ARRIVALS ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE 
FINDERS IS KEEPERS 
THE TIGRESS STROLLS AWAY TO TAKE A REST AFTER ALL THAT EXERTION 
SHE IS PROVING TO BE A VERY REMARKABLE MOTHER 
ABLE TO KILL SO EASILY THAT SHE HERSELF DOESN'T NEED TO FEED 
AT MANY OF HER KILLS 
HER DAUGHTER IS BEHAVING AS IF SHE'S KILLING THE DEER ALL OVER AGAIN 
HER SISTER AND BROTHERS SEEM CONTENT TO SIT IT OUT 
AND SHE MAKES SURE THEY REALISE WHOSE PRIZE IT IS 
OPENING SUCH A BIG CARCASS IS NOT EASY ON YOUR OWN 
SO SOON SHE LETS ONE OF HER BROTHERS JOIN HER 
RIVALRY DISAPPEARS AS TOGETHER THEY STRUGGLE TO CUT THROUGH 
THE DEER'S TOUGH HIDE 
AFTER A DAY FULL OF ACTION THE ELEPHANTS TAKE A BREAK 
BUT THE NEXT MORNING THE TIGERS HAVE DISAPPEARED 
IT'S THREE DAYS BEFORE THE ELEPHANTS FIND THEM AGAIN 
THEY ARE SOME DISTANCE AWAY FROM WHERE THEY WERE LAST SEEN 
AND MOVING VERY PURPOSEFULLY 
THE ELEPHANTS MUST TRAVEL FAST TO KEEP UP 
ALTHOUGH THAT DOESN'T PREVENT THEM FROM SNACKING ON THE MOVE 
ALL THE CUBS ARE HERE 
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF THE MOTHER 
AND IT'S UNUSUAL FOR THEM TO MOVE SO FAR WITHOUT HER 
AS THE ELEPHANTS GET CLOSER TO THEM 
THERE SEEMS LITTLE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE CUBS ARE STILL IN A PLAYFUL MOOD 
THE NEXT DAY BREAKS WITH A DECEPTIVE CALM 
WHEN THE CUBS ARE FOUND THEY'RE STILL ALONE 
THEY HAVE ARRIVED AT ONE OF THE PARK'S DAMS 
A FAVOURITE SOURCE OF FRESH WATER FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR 
THESE DAMS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE PARK 
ARE INVALUABLE IN THE DRIER MONTHS 
EVEN AT THIS TIME OF YEAR TIGERS FIND THEM IRRESISTIBLE 
AS USUAL THE CUBS USE THEM AS LAVATORIES SO CONCEALING THE SIGNS 
THAT MIGHT REVEAL THEIR PRESENCE TO ANOTHER TIGER 
WITH THEIR MOTHER ABSENT THEY ARE VERY VULNERABLE 
THEY FIND A TOY A LOG 
BUT THEIR PLAY IS RATHER SUBDUED 
WHEN THEIR MOTHER'S NOT AROUND THE CUBS BEHAVE VERY DIFFERENTLY 
THEY'RE QUIETER AND FAR LESS CONFIDENT 
THEY AVOID DELIBERATELY DRAWING ATTENTION TO THEMSELVES 
AND USUALLY STAY IN THE SAME PLACE 
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE STILL ON THE MOVE 
SUGGESTS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DISTURBED 
IT'S THREE DAYS SINCE THE MOTHER WAS LAST SEEN 
THE ELEPHANTS BEGIN ANOTHER SEARCH FOR HER 
LIKE THE TIGERS THE WILD GAME IN THE PARK IS TOTALLY UNDISTURBED 
BY THE PRESENCE OF THE ELEPHANTS 
IN SPITE OF THEIR GREAT SIZE THEY CAN BE SURPRISINGLY QUIET 
THE ELEPHANTS ARE ACCEPTED 
AS JUST ANOTHER HARMLESS INHABITANT OF THE FOREST 
BUT SOME CREATURES HERE ARE FAR FROM HARMLESS 
A STRANGE MALE HAS BEEN SIGHTED AGAIN 
HE'S A YOUNG TIGER WHO'S PROBABLY LOOKING FOR A TERRITORY OF HIS OWN 
THE CUBS ARE NOT FAR AWAY 
AND THEY SEEM TO HAVE PICKED UP THE MALE'S SCENT 
WITH CHARGER INJURED THE INTRUDER IS PROBABLY CONFIDENT ENOUGH 
TO LEAVE HIS OWN MARK 
THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR THE CUBS 
FOR THEIR MOTHER IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN 
THE ELEPHANTS SET OUT ONCE AGAIN 
TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND THE CUBS' MOTHER 
AT LAST THEY DISCOVER HER AT ONE OF HER OLD DEN SITES 
THIS IS VERY REASSURING 
BUT SOMETHING SEEMS WRONG 
SHE IS UNUSUALLY SUBDUED 
THEN WE FIND OUT WHY 
SHE HAS A WOUND IN HER CHEST THAT IS OBVIOUSLY CAUSING HER SOME DISTRESS 
SUCH A CUT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE HORNS OF HER PREY 
OR FROM A FIGHT WITH ANOTHER TIGER 
IT'S FRESH AND OBVIOUSLY A SERIOUS INJURY 
SHE'S IN A BAD WAY AND DESPERATELY NEEDS REST 
THIS EXPLAINS WHY SHE LEFT HER CUBS ALONE 
THE CUBS ARE STILL ON THE MOVE 
AND THEY'VE REACHED THE DAMMED RIVER IN THE CENTRE OF THE PARK 
CUBS RARELY WANDER FAR FROM WHERE THEIR MOTHER LEFT THEM 
BUT PERHAPS REALISING THAT THEY'RE NOW VERY MUCH ON THEIR OWN 
THEY SEEM ANXIOUS TO KEEP MOVING 
THEY'RE STILL TOO YOUNG TO SURVIVE WITHOUT THEIR MOTHER 
SO THEIR FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON HER MAKING A QUICK RECOVERY 
THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO AVOID BEING DETECTED 
BUT IT'S ALL IN VAIN 
THE STRANGE MALE HAS APPEARED 
NOT FAR FROM WHERE THE CUBS FOUND SCENT MARKS 
THIS IS TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT 
THEIR ONLY OPTION 
IS TO PUT AS MUCH DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM AND HIM AS POSSIBLE 
THE CUBS HAVE SURVIVED AGAINST THE ODDS 
BUT NOW THEY'RE IN GREAT DANGER 
WITH BOTH PARENTS INJURED AND A ROGUE MALE ON THE LOOSE 
THEY WILL NEED A MIRACLE TO PULL THROUGH 
IN THE NEXT SPY IN THE JUNGLE WE WILL FIND OUT IF THEIR LUCK HOLDS 
WE'RE IN POMPEII AND IT'S VOLCANO DAY 
YOU SAVE PEOPLE NOT THIS TIME 
SHOW YOURSELF I MUST MAKE THE MOST TERRIBLE CHOICE 
DONNA DOCTOR
