TODAY FLOG IT COMES FROM POOLE IN DORSET 
SO IT'S FULL STEAM AHEAD TO THE VALUATION DAY 
AT THE LIGHT HOUSE TO MEET UP WITH THE CROWDS AHEAD OF THE CREW 
LOOK AT THIS WHAT A FANTASTIC TURNOUT WE'VE GOT DOWN HERE IN POOLE IN DORSET 
OUTSIDE THE LIGHT HOUSE ART CENTRE 
ALL THESE PEOPLE HOPE THAT THEIR UNWANTED ANTIQUES WILL SAIL INTO THE AUCTION ROOM 
AND OUR TWO BEACONS OF KNOWLEDGE TODAY ARE EXPERTS CHARLIE ROSS AND MARK STACEY 
THEY'LL BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR BURIED TREASURES 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE VALUATION DAY HAS STARTED WITH A REAL PIECE OF QUALITY 
WELL JUNE HERE WE HAVE A WONDERFUL TEACUP SAUCER AND TEA PLATE YES 
IS IT THE ONLY ONE YOU HAVE NO I HAVE TWELVE OF EACH 
WONDERFUL BUT WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE OUT OF FOR THE SAFETY FACTOR 
YES WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT 
NOT AN AWFUL LOT IT WAS JUST MY MOTHER'S WEDDING PRESENT 
IT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR A LONG TIME WHEN DID SHE GET MARRIED 
SHE WAS MARRIED IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX 
WONDERFUL IT'S MADE BY THE SHELLEY FACTORY WHICH WE'VE HANDLED A LOT ON THE SHOW 
THE DESIGN IS TRANSFER PRINTED IN THE MAIN 
IT'S QUITE CHEAPLY PRODUCED BUT THEN HAND PAINTED IN OTHER PLACES WAS IT 
WHAT MAKES IT NICE IS THIS VERY ELEGANT ART DECO SHAPE 
THERE'S ONLY ONE BETTER SHAPE THAT'S WITH THE TRIANGULAR HANDLES 
THAT WE'VE ALSO FEATURED ON THE SHOW 
BUT THIS IS A VERY NICE JAZZY TEA SERVICE FROM RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ART DECO MOVEMENT YES 
YOUR MOTHER WAS VERY LUCKY TO GET IT AND SHE'S OBVIOUSLY NEVER USED IT 
NO IT'S BEEN KEPT IN A DISPLAY CABINET AND LOOKED AFTER YES IT WAS 
WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT IT ALONG TO SHOW US TODAY 
REALLY BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WAS WORTH AND TO THINK ABOUT SELLING IT RIGHT 
UNFORTUNATELY IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO HAVE THE TEAPOT WITH IT 
AND MAYBE YOU COULD BUY OR OTHER THINGS TOAST RACKS THOSE SORT OF THINGS THAT WENT WITH IT 
BUT YOU DO HAVE THE CREAM JUG AND SUGAR BOWL YES WHICH IS A NICE THING TO HAVE 
IF WE WERE PUTTING THIS IN FOR SALE I WOULD EXPECT THE ESTIMATE TO BE MAYBE THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED YES 
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'D BE HAPPY WITH IS THAT FOR THE TWELVE YES AND THE BREAD AND BUTTER YES 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY WITH THAT YES YOU'RE SURE YES 
WE'D PUT A RESERVE ON IT SO WE WOULDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY FOR ONE HUNDRED 
NO NO WE'D PUT A RESERVE OF THREE HUNDRED ON IT YES 
IF YOU ARE HAPPY WITH THAT WE'LL PUT IT IN YES OF COURSE YES 
VICKY HELLO HELLO HUGELY IMPRESSIVE 
LARGE I SUSPECT VERY HEAVY 
YES WHERE DID IT COME FROM AND HOW DID YOU GET IT HERE 
I GOT IT HERE IN THE CAR AND IT'S FROM MY GREAT UNCLE WHO DIED FIVE YEARS AGO 
NOBODY ELSE REALLY WANTED IT 
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING 
I KNOW IT WAS BOUGHT AT AUCTION BECAUSE HE HAS A PICTURE OF IT WITH A LOT NUMBER ON THE BACK 
RIGHT DID THE STORY COME THROUGH WITH HOW MUCH IT COST AT AUCTION NO HE DIDN'T TELL ME THAT 
NEVER DISCUSSED THAT DID HE HAVE OTHER THINGS LIKE THIS IN THE HOUSE 
NOT REALLY NO 
SUCH A STRANGE THING TO GO OFF AND BUY IT IS 
YOU WOULD EXPECT THIS TO BE IN WITH RESPECT QUITE AN IMPORTANT HOUSE 
IT IS AN IMPOSING OBJECT AND SOMETHING THAT WOULD LOOK 
WITH RESPECT PRETTY DAMN SILLY IN AN ORDINARY HOUSE 
IT WAS IN A FLAT IN A FLAT 
YEAH THIRD FLOOR FLAT THIRD FLOOR MUST HAVE BEEN A WELL BUILT BLOCK OF FLATS 
IT WAS A NARROW HALLWAY 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S MADE OF I PRESUME IT'S BRASS IT IS BRASS 
BUT IT HAS BEEN BRONZED AT SOME STAGE 
IT'S HAD A COATING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A BRONZE 
THIS ACANTHUS LEAF DECORATION ON THE HANDLE 
I THINK IS JUST STUNNING IT'S SWIRLY 
DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD IT IS NO IDEA 
NO IDEA AT ALL NO IDEA AT ALL 
IT'S JUST OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
I THINK THERE'S ONE PART THAT LETS THIS EWER DOWN AND IF WE GO DOWN 
IF WE CAN LOWER OURSELVES WITHOUT TOO MUCH CRACKING OF KNEES 
IT'S THE CLASSICAL FIGURES ROUND THE MAIN BODY 
IF YOU LOOK AT THEM 
THE FACES ARE NOT GOOD ARE THEY 
YOU CAN'T SEE THEM THAT WELL 
EXACTLY THERE'S VERY LITTLE DEFINITION 
STILL I THINK SOMEONE WILL LIKE IT FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY 
I THINK WILL PUT AN ESTIMATE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY IF YOU'RE HAPPY WITH THAT YES 
A RESERVE AT TWO HUNDRED WHICH IS A BOTTOM LINE AND WE CAN TAKE IT FROM THERE 
NOT EVERYBODY'S CUP OF TEA BUT GIVEN THE RIGHT COUPLE OF PEOPLE WE COULD DO WELL WITH THAT 
IT'S BEEN A TALKING POINT IN MY HOUSE I'M SURE IT HAS 
WHAT A FINE VICTORIAN ROCKING HORSE IT'S GOOD TO SEE THEM 
AND YOU DON'T SEE MANY AROUND IN ORIGINAL CONDITION LIKE THIS RAY AND MAUREEN TELL ME ITS STORY 
WELL IT'S A FAMILY HEIRLOOM 
WE HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS AND THE OLDEST ONE SHE DIDN'T GET MARRIED AND HAVE CHILDREN 
THE YOUNGEST ONE DID AND SHE SAID IT BELONGS TO HER SO 
I THOUGHT TO SAVE THE ARGUMENTS I'LL 
STOP THEM FROM SQUABBLING BRING IT ALONG TO FLOG IT 
IT'S WHAT'S CALLED A BOW ROCKER 
IT'S A CLASSIC HEIGHT THIRTY INCHES AND IT WAS MADE AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY 
IT REALLY IS A CLASSIC TYPE OF ROCKING HORSE 
YOU'D SEE IN ALL THE NURSERIES IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND 
IT'S MADE OF WOOD IN FACT IT'S MADE OF PITCH PINE 
IT'S QUITE A LIGHT WOOD IT'S A CONIFER 
YOU CAN SEE THE PITCH PINE HERE GRINNING THROUGH WITH THE HORSE'S EARS WHERE IT'S TAKEN A LOT OF RUB 
BUT ONE OF ITS VIRTUES IS THE FACT THAT IT'S IN ORIGINAL CONDITION 
IT'S CRISP 
IT'S BEEN THROUGH THE WARS BUT IT'S GOT ITS ORIGINAL PATINA 
THESE VARIEGATED HUES THAT BLEND IN WITH EACH OTHER THROUGH AGE 
IT'S MISSING ITS MANE YOU CAN SEE WERE THE NAILS 
HELD IN SOME HORSE HAIR THIS WOULD'VE BEEN ORIGINAL HORSE HAIR AND LIKEWISE WITH THE TAIL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS WORTH 
IF YOU HAD TO PUT A BET ON IT 
TO BE A WINNER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED 
I TELL YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO BETTER THAT I THINK WE CAN PUT THIS INTO AUCTION 
AND ASK EIGHT HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED FOR IT 
REALLY 
YES AND PUT A RESERVE OF SEVEN ON 
THAT'S VERY NICE 
YES HAVE WE GOT A WINNER HERE 
YES DEFINITELY IT REALLY IS A CLASSIC PIECE OF VICTORIAN ENGLAND 
IT'S GOT THE LOOK IT'S GOT THE TEXTURE IT'S GOT THE RUB IT'S GOT EVERYTHING ABOUT IT 
AND MY WORD IT COULD TELL A FEW STORIES IF IT COULD SPEAK 
MANY A TIME I WENT THAT FAST I WENT OVER THE TOP 
LET'S HOPE THEY ALL GO OVER THE TOP ON THIS ONE AT AUCTION 
WHAT A CHARMING OBJECT YOU'VE BROUGHT IN TO SHOW US 
A. N. N. AND STEFAN A VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PORTRAIT MINIATURE IS IT A FAMILY PIECE 
IT'S FROM MY MOTHER'S FAMILY 
BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF IT IS A RELATION WHO IT IS 
SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S JUST BEEN ACQUIRED AT SOME POINT IN YOUR FAMILY 
AND GONE IN WITH THE REST OF THE CHATTELS I SUPPOSE 
IF WE LOOK IN DETAIL AT IT 
WE'VE GOT A VERY TYPICAL PORTRAIT MINIATURE OF A GENTLEMAN CIRCA EIGHTEEN HUNDRED 
MAYBE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY MAYBE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TEN BUT THAT KIND OF PERIOD 
MOUNTED IN THIS GEM SET GOLD FRAME 
BEAUTIFULLY PAINTED THERE IS A LITTLE CRACK 
RUNNING THROUGH THE IVORY THIS IS PAINTED ON IVORY 
ON A THIN SHEET OF IVORY BUT IT'S VERY DELICATELY PAINTED 
AND I LOVE THE LITTLE BLUE JACKET WITH THE ROUGH COLLAR AND WIG 
IT IS VERY VERY PRETTY BUT IT DOES APPEAL ONLY TO A CERTAIN MARKET 
WHETHER YOU'RE COLLECTING THEM IN A CABINET OR SOME PEOPLE HANG THEM ON THE WALL ON A PIECE OF VELVET 
THEY'VE OFTEN BEEN MADE INTO BROOCHES LIKE THIS ONE HAS 
MY WIFE DOESN'T WANT TO WEAR IT SO IT'S JUST SITTING IN THE DRAWER 
WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT TRY AND FLOG IT I LIKE IT I THINK IT WILL APPEAL TO A CERTAIN COLLECTOR AS I SAID 
IT IS GOING INTO A GENERAL SALE WE'VE GOT TO BEAR THAT IN MIND 
ALSO WE'VE GOT TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THESE TRADITIONAL ANTIQUES ARE NOT 
MAKING THE KIND OF MONEY THEY USED TO MAKE 
IF IT WAS A KNOWN SITTER AND PORTRAITER 
THEN WE WOULD KNOW AND THAT WOULD ADD VALUE TO IT 
I THINK IF WE'RE PUTTING IT IN FOR SALE WE'VE GOT TO BE LOOKING AT AN 
ESTIMATE OF AROUND THE TWO HUNDRED MARK SO MAYBE TWO HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
THEN LOOKING AT A RESERVE WE'VE GOT TO 
THINK OF AROUND TWO HUNDRED MAYBE A LITTLE BIT UNDER THAT MAYBE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY RESERVE 
AND HOPEFULLY ON THE DAY TWO SPECIALIST BUYERS 
WHETHER THEY ARE COLLECTORS OR SPECIALIST DEALERS 
WILL COME IN AND HAVE A STAB AT IT 
WE'RE CERTAINLY TAKING A MIXED BAG OF ITEMS TO THE AUCTION ROOM TODAY 
THE SHELLEY PORCELAIN IS ALWAYS POPULAR WITH THE COLLECTORS 
BUT THE BRONZE EWER SEEMS TO HAVE DIVIDED OPINION 
DESPITE THE CONDITION I'M CONVINCED THE ODDS ARE GOOD FOR THE ROCKING HORSE 
AND THE MINIATURE PORTRAIT MAY BE SMALL BUT IT SHOULD MAKE A LARGE PROFIT 
IMPRESSIVE ISN'T IT 
THOMAS HARDY USED TO STAY THERE 
WE'RE IN DORCHESTER AND TODAY'S AUCTION IS DUKE'S AUCTION ROOMS JUST UP THE ROAD AND AROUND THE CORNER 
LET'S CATCH UP WITH AUCTIONEER GARY BATT 
AND SEE WHAT HE'S GOT TO SAY ABOUT SOME OF OUR OWNERS' ITEMS 
I LOVE THIS ROCKING HORSE BELONGS TO MAUREEN 
AND I PUT A VALUE OF EIGHT HUNDRED ON THIS 
I KNOW HE'S GOT A FEW THINGS MISSING HE NEEDS SOME T. L. C. BUT HE'S GORGEOUS 
HE'S A LOVELY LOOKING MODEL HE'S GOT A REALLY NICELY SHAPED FACE 
THESE ON THESE ROCKERS RATHER THAN THE STRAIGHTFORWARD BARS ARE MUCH MORE DESIRABLE AND EARLIER 
BUT AS YOU SAY HE'S IN A BIT OF ROUGH CONDITION HE COULD DO WITH THE VISIT TO THE VET 
THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF HIS VIRTUES BECAUSE HE HASN'T 
BEEN RESTORED HASN'T BEEN TAMPERED WITH HE'S FRESH TO THE MARKET 
HE'S UNTOUCHED ALTOGETHER AND HE COULD DO WITH A NEW MANE AND TAIL ALTERATIONS 
BUT I THINK EIGHT HUNDRED WE MIGHT NOT QUITE GET THERE 
REALLY WELL I THINK THE CONDITION IS AGAINST IT TO THAT EXTENT 
IT WOULD NEED QUITE A BIG RESTORATION TO BE IN FIT CONDITION 
IF HE WAS IN GOOD NICK HE WOULD BE WORTH TWO GRAND 
PROBABLY RETAIL HE'D BE WORTH A COUPLE OF THOUSAND POUNDS 
AREN'T WE ALL SAYING THE AUCTION ROOMS ARE THE NEW RETAIL OUTLETS 
YOU'RE CHARGING FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PER CENT COMMISSION EITHER WAY 
BY THE TIME THEY'VE PAID YOUR COMMISSION THEY'VE PAID SHOP PRICES 
A DEALER CAN'T BUY SOMETHING IN AUCTION ANY MORE AND DOUBLE HIS MARK UP 
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT YOU ARE THE NEW RETAIL 
LET'S HOPE SO THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO BE AND OF COURSE 
OUR CHARGES ARE ENTIRELY REASONABLE IN ALL WAYS HE SMILES WELL YOU'VE GOT OVERHEADS 
IT'D BE NICE TO GET NOT A TRADER WHO'S IN BETWEEN BUT THE ULTIMATE CONSUMER AND YOU MAY GET THAT 
SOMEBODY WITH A SMALL CHILD WHO MAY WANT TO GET ASTRIDE AND RIDE THE BEAST 
THIS HAS GOT TO SELL THIS HAS GOT TO BE WORTH EIGHT HUNDRED OF ANYBODY'S MONEY WE'LL TRY AND DO THAT 
WHEN WE GET TO OVER ONE THOUSAND WE'LL GO IN GUINEAS AS IN A HORSE SALE 
O. K. DO YOUR BEST HE'S GOING TO GET ON THE ROSTRUM RIGHT NOW AND LET'S GET FLOGGING 
WE'RE LOOKING AT TWO HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOR THIS LITTLE PORTRAIT MINIATURE BROUGHT IN BY ANNA AND STEFAN 
WILL WE GET IT WHY ARE YOU FLOGGING IT 
I MEAN I LIKE THIS

NOW WE'RE LEAVING THE SALE ROOM FOR A DIFFERENT SORT OF EXCITEMENT 
POOLE IS FAMOUS FOR ONE OF THE NOISIEST SPORTS AROUND SPEEDWAY 
THE POOLE PIRATES HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF GOING SIDEWAYS AROUND THE WIMBORNE ROAD STADIUM 
THIS OLD STADIUM WAS BUILT IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUILT IT TO GIVE THE RESIDENTS SOMETHING TO DO DURING THE TIMES OF THE DEPRESSION 
IT WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT AS A SOCCER PITCH WHICH HAD A CYCLE TRACK THAT RAN ALL ROUND THE OUTSIDE 
NOWADAYS THE FOOTBALL'S LONG GONE 
IT'S HOME TO THE SPEEDWAY WHICH IS SHARED WITH THE GREYHOUND RACING 
ONE FAMILY WITH POOLE SPEEDWAY IN THEIR BLOOD 
IS THE FATHER AND SON COMBINATION OF KEN AND NEIL MIDDLEDITCH 
I'M HERE WITH KEN WHO'S AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS MR. POOLE SPEEDWAY 
KEN PLEASED TO MEET YOU IT'S AN HONOUR 
AN HONOUR TO MEET YOU MY GOODNESS TELL US WHAT IS SPEEDWAY AND WHERE DID IT ORIGINATE FROM 
SPEEDWAY IS ACTUALLY A MOTORCYCLE RACING SPORT 
IT ORIGINATED IN AUSTRALIA 
BACK IN THE MID TWENTIES WHY DID IT START OUT THERE I DON'T KNOW 
POSSIBLY BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF DESERT AND THEY HAD A LOT OF SPACE TO RACE ON 
THEN IT WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE U. K. BY A VERY WELL KNOWN MAN JOHNNY HOSKINS 
HE WAS THE MR. SPEEDWAY IN THOSE DAYS 
YEAH HOW BIG WAS IT IN HIS DAY IN THIS AREA 
IT STARTED OFF QUITE SMALL BUT IT GREW BECAUSE AROUND POOLE THERE ARE SO MANY SMALL VILLAGES 
AND THEY USED TO DRAW FROM THEM AND HAD GREAT SUPPORT FROM THEM 
IN ITS HEYDAY WHAT WAS THE CAPACITY CROWD HOW MANY PEOPLE USED TO COME AND WATCH 
IT STARTED MAYBE TWO THOUSAND OR THREE THOUSAND BUT IT BUILT UP TO 
AN AVERAGE CROWD OF FOUR THOUSAND TO SIX THOUSAND 
FOR BIG MEETINGS THEY USED TO PULL IN TWELVE THOUSAND OR THIRTEEN THOUSAND 
WOW IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR A SMALL STADIUM AS IT WAS THEN 
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE ROAR THE SMELL YOU KNOW THE FUMES EVERYTHING 
THE ATMOSPHERE REALLY WAS SOMETHING ELSE 
WHY WERE YOU DRAWN TO IT 
I LIKE A LOT OF YOUNGSTERS THE ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORT IN THOSE DAYS WAS MOTORCYCLES 
I FIRST SAW SPEEDWAY IN BELLE VUE WHEN I WAS STATIONED THERE DURING THE WAR UP IN MANCHESTER 
MANCHESTER BEFORE I WENT ABROAD 
AND YOU GOT HOOKED I GOT HOOKED AND THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO DO 
WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE R. A. F. 
I STARTED YOU'RE A VERY MODEST MAN BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WERE A BRILLIANT RIDER IN YOUR DAY 
YOU WERE ONE OF THE BEST I ENJOYED IT I LOVED IT 
I ENJOYED THE TEAMS AND TRAVELLING 
THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE OF SPEEDWAY'S GREAT 
TALK ME THROUGH THE RULES DO YOU RIDE AS A TEAM OR AGAINST EACH OTHER NO YOU RIDE AS A PAIR 
THE IDEA OF RIDING AS A PAIR IS IF YOU STICK TOGETHER 
YOU CAN TAKE UP A LOT OF TRACK AND BLOCK OFF THE OPPOSITION 
I'VE GOT IT NOW THE OTHER BEAUTY ABOUT RIDING TOGETHER IS IF YOUR PARTNER COMES IN FIRST 
AND YOU COME IN SECOND YOU GET PAID FOR FIRST AS WELL 
RIGHT I SEE SO YOU DON'T RACE YOUR PARTNER 
NO THAT'S GOOD OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE TOO COMPETITIVE THAT'S THE IDEA 
COULD YOU WIN A LOT OF MONEY BACK THEN NOT A LOT ENOUGH TO LIVE ON 
YOU COULD EARN ENOUGH TO BE A PROFESSIONAL PAY OUR EXPENSES YES 
WHAT SORT OF MONEY WE USED TO EARN FIFTEEN SHILLINGS A POINT SEVENTY FIVE P. 
YEAH A POINT A POINT 
HOW MANY POINTS CAN YOU GET IN A NIGHT THEN THREE POINTS FOR A WIN 
YOU COULD EARN FORTY FIVE SHILLINGS THAT'S NOT BAD 
NO NO BECAUSE IN THOSE DAYS YOU COULD BUY AN ENGINE FOR SEVENTY FIVE 
YEAH THAT'S JUST AT ONE RACE MEETING 
IF YOU'RE DOING THREE OR FOUR RACE MEETS A WEEK OH YES 
YOU COULD EARN A LIVING YES 
YOU COULD EARN ENOUGH TO LIVE ON AND MAINTAIN YOUR BIKE 
HOW LOVELY IT WAS A STRUGGLE 
HAS IT CHANGED TODAY MUCH OH YES IT'S MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED COLOURFUL I LOVE IT 
YOU HAVE TO BE PRETTY FEARLESS ON ONE OF THOSE BIKES RACING AWAY 
NOT REALLY YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT 
YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT DO YOU SO MUCH EXCITEMENT ALL AT ONCE 
I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU THIS WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU GOT ON A BIKE AND RODE AROUND THIS PARTICULAR TRACK 
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THEY DID A TESTIMONIAL FOR NEIL AND MYSELF 
FOR THE AMOUNT OF YEARS WE'D PUT INTO POOLE SPEEDWAY SO THEY ASKED US TO DO A FEW LAPS 
HOW DID IT FEEL GREAT 
TEMPTING VERY TEMPTING 
TEMPTED TO GO ON IT AGAIN TODAY YEAH 
I'D LOVE TO BUT I'M PAST IT NOW 
NEVER TOO LATE I'M EIGHTY YEARS OLD 
ARE YOU REALLY YES WELL YOU DON'T LOOK IT 
THANK YOU COME AGAIN 
WELL I KNOW NEIL IS OVER THERE WAITING IN THE PITS WITH A SELECTION OF BIKES FOR ME TO LOOK AT 
AND HOPEFULLY I'M GONNA HAVE A GO ON ONE SHALL WE GO AND LOOK 
YOU'D LIKE THAT WOULD YOU I WOULD LOVE THAT COME ON THEN LET'S GO 
NEIL YOU'RE THE GREAT BRITAIN TEAM MANAGER NOW 
YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW YOUR ONIONS OR IN THIS CASE YOUR BIKES TO GET THAT SORT OF QUALIFICATION 
YOU'RE A GREAT RIDER AS WELL YOUR DAD TAUGHT YOU 
THIS WAS A BIKE FROM YOUR DAD'S PERIOD WASN'T IT 
YES THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT DAD USED TO RIDE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY USED TO RIDE THEM 
IT'S A DESIGN ICON I LOVE ALL THE CHROME 
IT IS BRILLIANT ISN'T IT A PIECE OF SCULPTURE 
IT LOOKS VERY LIGHTWEIGHT 
IT IS THEY WERE BUILT FOR SPEED NOT FOR COMFORT 
AS YOU CAN SEE SEAT THE BARS NO BRAKES AND NO GEARS NO BRAKES 
NOW WHY NO BRAKES IS WHAT WE WANNA KNOW 
WE USED TO WONDER THAT AS WELL 
NO IT'S MAINLY FROM A SAFETY POINT OF VIEW GUYS RUNNING INTO THE BACK 
OF EACH OTHER THAT SORT OF THING REALLY YEAH 
WELL LET'S SEE HOW THEY'VE EVOLVED THE ONE BEHIND US 
IS WHAT FROM THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
NO THIS IS ACTUALLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
THIS IS MY BIKE THE ONE I FINISHED RACING ON THIS BIKE'S GOT LOTS OF MEMORIES FOR YOU 
OH YEAH ABSOLUTELY THIS IS THE ONE I FINISHED ON 
MY CHILDREN CAN LOOK AT IT AND SAY WHAT DID YOU DO FOR A LIVING DAD THIS IS WHAT I USED TO RACE 
WOW IT'S INCREDIBLE ISN'T IT 
HOW FAST WHAT SORT OF SPEEDS COULD YOU DO ON THIS 
THEY RUN ON METHANOL NOT LIKE PETROL 
THEY'LL DO ZERO TO SIXTY IN THREE SECONDS 
THAT'S FAST VERY FAST VERY FAST FROM A STANDING START 
ESPECIALLY WITH NO BRAKES 
WELL IT LOOKS GREAT BUT AGAIN THEY ARE EVOLVING AREN'T THEY 
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW IF WE ZOOM AROUND HERE 
THIS BIKE IS A PROTOTYPE WHICH WAS BUILT BY A LOCAL FIRM PENSKE 
WHO MAKE INDY CARS FOR TONY RICARDSON THE SIX TIMES WORLD CHAMPION 
THIS IS CALLED THE MIDDLO WHICH IS NAMED AFTER MY FATHER AND I 
THIS IS THE FIRST ONE BUILT THIS IS WHAT TONY RACES AT THE MOMENT 
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE BUILT TO LAST NOW DON'T THEY 
THEY DO CRASH QUITE A BIT AND DO BEND QUITE EASILY DO THEY WE DON'T WANNA KNOW THAT 
THERE'S ONE MORE TO LOOK AT WHICH REALLY IS THE STATE OF THE ART 
EXACTLY WHAT YOUNG RIDERS WOULD WISH TO RIDE TODAY 
THIS IS HOW WE SEE THE FUTURE OF SPEEDWAY WITH STREAMLINING FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE SPEED 
IT'S TENTHS OF SECONDS IN SPEEDWAY YOU CAN WIN A RACE IN 
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THIS IS THE WAY THAT THE SPORT'S GOING AT THE MOMENT 
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE ATMOSPHERE OF SPEEDWAY CAN BE INTOXICATING 
EVERY WEEK THESE POWERFUL MACHINES ARE TWEAKED TO PERFECTION 
BEFORE THEY HURTLE AROUND THE TRACK IN BREATH TAKING RACES PITCHING MAN AND MACHINE AGAINST THEIR RIVALS 
THAT'S JUST HOW IT'S ALWAYS BEEN HERE AT THE WIMBORNE STADIUM THROUGHOUT THE GENERATIONS 
WELL LET'S HOPE THE EXCITEMENT CONTINUES BACK AT THE VALUATION DAY 
I LOVE THIS I ABSOLUTELY THINK IT'S FANTASTIC 
I'M GLAD 
I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I SAW IT 
IT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL PIECE OF BRANNAM I'VE SEEN FOR A LONG TIME 
REALLY 
CATHERINE YOU'VE EXCITED ME WITH THIS 
WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM 
I BOUGHT IT AT AN AUCTION IN DISS ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO REALLY 
I USED TO HAVE IT ON DISPLAY IN MY OLD HOUSE BUT SINCE THEN I'VE MOVED AND BECOME MORE MODERN 
IT'S GOT NO PLACE REALLY SO IT'S IN A CUPBOARD 
WHAT DID YOU PAY FOR IT TEN YEARS AGO 
IT WAS A LOT OF MONEY FOR ME THEN 
I THINK I PAID ABOUT ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED 
BUT I LOVED IT AND TO ME THAT WAS WORTH IT 
SO YOU PAID ONE HUNDRED FOR IT TEN YEARS AGO 
M. M. M. I WON'T COME ON TO THE PRICE AT THE MOMENT I JUST WANT TO SHARE THE EXCITEMENT OF THE VASE 
BECAUSE CHARLES BRANNAM IS A VERY WELL KNOWN POTTER FROM BARNSTAPLE 
HE PRODUCED THIS SORT OF VICTORIAN ART NOUVEAU 
AND GOTHIC ART PIECES OF POTTERY 
A LOT OF THEM HAVE GOT GROTESQUE FISHES GARGOYLES ON THEM THAT SORT OF THING 
THIS ONE IS A VERY SIMPLE 
TAPERED CYLINDER OF A VASE WHICH HAS GOT A LOVELY FEEL TO IT 
IT'S SO TACTILE YOU JUST WANT TO KEEP TOUCHING IT 
THEN THROUGHOUT THE VASE YOU'VE GOT THESE WONDERFUL DECORATION OF THE SWOOPING 
ALMOST A CROSS BETWEEN AN EAGLE AND A LYREBIRD OR A PEACOCK 
THESE WONDERFUL LITTLE ART NOUVEAU DETAILS 
VERY SIMPLE BUT VERY EFFECTIVE TURNING IT AROUND WE'VE GOT THIS WONDERFUL FLORAL 
AGAIN VERY ART NOUVEAU VERY FLOWING DESIGN 
GOING RIGHT ROUND AGAIN AND THESE WONDERFUL SLIP GLAZES 
UNDERNEATH WE'VE GOT A LOVELY SET OF MARKS CHARLES BRANNAM BARUM 
REGISTERED NUMBER AND AGAIN F. B. FOR BARUM POTTERY 
BARUM IS THE ROMAN WORD FOR BARNSTAPLE 
OH RIGHT YEP I JUST ADORE IT 
I WOULD LOVE IT IN MY HOME I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
I'M SO PLEASED 
YOU PAID ONE HUNDRED TEN YEARS AGO YES 
WE ALWAYS SAY ON THIS PROGRAMME WHEN YOU BOUGHT SOMETHING TEN YEARS AGO 
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS EXPECT TO MAKE A PROFIT ON THINGS M. M. M. 
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THINGS GO OUT OF FASHION AND INTO FASHION 
AND WHAT ONE PERSON LIKES ANOTHER PERSON DOESN'T 
DO YOU THINK IT'S GONE UP OR DOWN 
I DON'T THINK IT'LL HAVE GONE DOWN BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T SEEM 
A LOT OF MONEY NOWADAYS SO I THINK PROBABLY ABOUT THE SAME 
WELL I'M GONNA PUT TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED ON IT 
NO YES 
IT'S SUCH A LOVELY EXAMPLE OF HIS WORK 
THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH SELLING IT FOR LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED 
YOU'RE KIDDING AND IF WE CAN'T GET A BUYER FOR TWO HUNDRED I'LL GIVE YOU A CHEQUE FOR TWO HUNDRED MYSELF 
OH I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH THAT YOU'D BE HAPPY TO SELL IT DEFINITELY 
WELL I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AT THE AUCTION 
AND LET'S HOPE IT BLOOMS ON THE DAY AND GIVES YOU A GOOD PROFIT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH CATHERINE 
WE'VE RUMMAGED AROUND IN YOUR BOX HAVEN'T WE ANNE WE HAVE 
WE'VE COME UP WITH A NICE LITTLE MIXTURE OF JEWELLERY 
FASCINATING ITEMS YES 
ARE THEY PASSED DOWN THROUGH THE YEARS YES 
THERE ARE TWO SEALS THERE WHICH ARE JUST WONDERFUL 
AND GEORGIAN AND GOLD AND DELIGHTFUL 
ONE OF THEM'S GOT AN INSCRIPTION ON IT HASN'T IT IT HAS FAITHFUL IN ADVERSITY 
FAITHFUL IN ADVERSITY AND IT'S THAT ONE YES AND I HAVE USED THEM FOR SEALING WAX 
ONE OF THE MORE INTRIGUING THINGS IS THIS ITEM HERE 
YES THAT'S AN AMETHYST 
YES DECENT SIZED AMETHYST DECENT COLOUR WITH SEED PEARLS AROUND IT 
BUT I DON'T THINK IT EVER STARTED LIFE AS A RING NO 
THE STORY IS IT WAS ORIGINALLY WITH MY GRANDMOTHER A BROOCH YEAH 
AND SOMEBODY BETWEEN MY GRANDMOTHER AND MY MOTHER HAD IT MADE INTO A RING 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND PEOPLE NOWADAYS THAT WILL WEAR A RING LIKE THAT 
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT THAT WILL BE CONVERTED BACK TO A BROOCH ALMOST CERTAINLY YES 
I RATHER THINK THE SAME APPLIES TO THE CAMEO AS WELL 
THAT WILL BE CHANGED BACK THE OTHER ITEMS STAND ON THEIR OWN 
WE'VE GOT A PEARL HERE VERY PRETTY LITTLE BROOCH I THINK THAT IS BEAUTIFUL 
IT'S LOVELY ISN'T IT YES THE WORKMANSHIP IN THAT BUT I'M NOT A BROOCH PERSON 
NO WELL IT'S QUITE DATED ISN'T IT 
IT'S A VICTORIAN BROOCH AND IT LOOKS VICTORIAN 
IT DOES YES THEY'RE NICE WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL THEM 
BECAUSE THEY'RE STUCK AWAY IN A DRAWER THAT'S NO GOOD IS IT NO 
I THINK THERE'S NOTHING THERE OF ANY MASSIVE INDIVIDUAL MERIT NO 
I THINK BY AND LARGE THE PERSON INTERESTED IN ONE IS GOING TO BUY ANOTHER OR A DEALER WILL BUY THEM 
SPLIT THEM UP PERHAPS AND MAKE THEM INTO BROOCHES 
I THINK THE WAY TO SELL THEM IS A COLLECTIVE LOT IF YOU'RE HAPPY WITH THAT YES YES 
WHICH MEANS I'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH A VALUE 
WHICH IS NOT TOO DIFFICULT BUT I THINK WE'LL BE CONSERVATIVE ER 
I'D RATHER SHOOT A LITTLE LOW THAN A LITTLE HIGH AND YOU WANT TO SELL THEM ANYWAY I DO 
LET'S GET SOME ACTION I THINK IF WE PUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY HOW WOULD THAT SOUND 
FANTASTIC REALLY YES 
OH GOODY I THOUGHT I WAS BEING A BIT CONSERVATIVE 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO WE'LL PUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WE'LL RESERVE THEM AT TWO HUNDRED O. K. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE THAT'S FINE 
YOU CAN'T SELL THEM FOR LESS THAN THAT IT WOULD BE A CRIME 
WE HAVE ALREADY MET ANNA AND STEPHAN ONCE TODAY AND IT LOOKS LIKE 
ANNA HAS FOUND SOME MORE STUFF OF STEPHAN'S TO SELL ON AT AUCTION 
HELLO STEPHAN HELLO ANNA HELLO 
I LOVE THESE ALTHOUGH I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE THEM ANNA NO I DON'T WHY NOT 
THEY'VE JUST UGLY HORRIBLE LITTLE DEVILS 
BUT WHERE HAVE THEY COME FROM STEPHAN'S FAMILY 
MY MOTHER CHOSE THEM FROM HER UNCLE'S ESTATE 
THEY FASCINATED HER AS A CHILD 
THEY'RE QUITE INTERESTING THEY'RE ACTUALLY LITTLE BRONZE FIGURES 
THEY'RE WHAT WE CALL COLD PAINTED BRONZE 
THEY ARE LARGE MADE IN AUSTRIA 
YOU TAKE A LITTLE BRONZE FIGURE THAT'S BEEN CAST 
AND THEN YOU PAINT IT WHEN IT'S COLD 
HENCE THE COLD PAINTED BRONZE 
THESE ARE LITTLE NOVELTY HUMOROUS OBJECTS 
WHAT I REALLY LIKE ARE THE DEVILS 
I FIND THEM REALLY FASCINATING THIS LOVELY ONE WASHING ANOTHER ONE IN A TIN BATH 
THEN THIS ONE RIDING A PIG 
I THINK THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
I THINK THESE WILL APPEAL TO COLLECTORS 
THEY'RE REALLY QUITE EXCITING TO BE HONEST 
YOU HAD THEM QUITE A LONG TIME STEPHAN I HAVE 
I USED TO HAVE THEM IN MY BEDROOM BUT ANNA DOESN'T LIKE THEM 
SO THEY'VE BEEN WRAPPED UP IN A DRAWER OH WHAT A SHAME 
I THINK IF WE'RE PUTTING THEM IN THE SALE WE'VE GOT TO BE REALISTIC 
WE'VE GOT TO TELL PEOPLE WE DON'T THINK THEY ARE VERY VALUABLE 
THAT THEN WILL MAKE THEM WANT TO BUY THEM ALL THE MORE 
I WOULD LIKE TO PUT THEM IN AS A LITTLE GROUP 
ER YOU'VE GOT THE LITTLE DOG HERE WHICH IS MISSING ITS CYMBALS 
GENERALLY THERE'S A BIT OF PAINT MISSING THAT SORT OF THING 
I THINK WE SHOULD PUT THEM IN AT THREE HUNDRED 
THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED AS A LITTLE GROUP 
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED 
IF THERE ARE TWO OR THREE COMPETING BIDDERS FOR IT 
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY MADE DOUBLE THAT 
GOODNESS BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE VERY COLLECTIBLE 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY FOR US TO DO THAT I AM YOU'RE QUITE DETERMINED ANNA AREN'T YOU 
I SHALL BE SAD WHEN THEY GO 
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU PLAYING WITH THEM 
WELL I THINK WE'LL CHANGE THE CONVERSATION THERE 
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'VE BROUGHT THEM IN AND DECIDED TO FLOG THEM WITH US TODAY 
I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING YOU BOTH AGAIN AT THE AUCTION 
AND LET'S HOPE WE FIND A DEVIL WORSHIPPER WHO LIKES THEM AS MUCH AS I DO 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU LET'S HOPE SO 
SO FAR OUR LOTS HAVEN'T DONE VERY WELL AT THE AUCTION 
LET'S HOPE FOR SOME BETTER LUCK THIS TIME 
THE COLLECTORS SHOULD SPOT THE QUALITY IN THE CHARLES BRANNAM VASE 
HOPEFULLY CHARLIE'S CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE ON THE JEWELLERY SHOULD ATTRACT THE BIDDERS 
BUT COULD THE UNUSUAL BRONZE FIGURES SPRING A SURPRISE
