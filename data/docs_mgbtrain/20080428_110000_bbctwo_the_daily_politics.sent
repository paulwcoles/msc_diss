HELLO WELCOME TO THE DAILY 
POLITICS IT IS CRUNCH WEEK FOR 
GORDON BROWN AS HE TRIES TO PUT 
FRAUD WITH POSTAL VOTING IN PARTICULAR BEING LOOKED AT 
AND HOW HIGH COULD BE COST OF SPEAK 
TO VOTERS IN THEIR NEW WESTMINSTER 
CONSTITUENCY IN ESSEX 
I BELIEVE WE 
ARE BEING RIPPED OFF SERIOUSLY BY 
THE E. U. AT THE PRESENT TIME AND I 
HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY WITH UFRPLT 
KIP BUT THEY CANNOT WIN 
THE NEXT ELECTION 
UKIP 
ALL THAT COMING UP IN THE NEXT HALF 
AN HOUR AND WITH ME FOR THE WHOLE 
PROGRAMME TODAY IS THE LEADER OF 
THE U. K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY NIGEL 
FARAGE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME 
THANKS 
AS WE GEAR UP FOR NEXT THANKS THURSDAY'S CRUCIAL ELECTION LOCAL 
ELECTIONS THERE IS CRITICISM THAT 
OUR SYSTEM IS COULD BE FLAWED HERE 
ARE THE CONCERNS EXPLAINED THE THE MAIN PROBLEM IS POSTAL REGISTRATION 
WHICH IS SHOWN TO HAVE INACCURACIES 
THROUGHOUT THE RVER AND THAT LEAVES 
THINGS OPEN TO FRAUD PARTICULARLY 
WHERE POSTAL BALLOTS ARE IN THE 
SYSTEM AND SECONDLY THERE HAVE 
BEEN A NUMBER OF VERY CLEAR CASES 
OF FRAUD IN RECENT YEARS IN FACT FOUR 
PEOPLE CONVICTED OF FRAUD SINCE 
TWO THOUSAND AND THERE IS LIKELY TO BE MORE 
TO FOLLOW AND IF WE WANT TO ADD IN 
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE 
ELECTRONIC COUNTING AND PILOTS OF 
ELECTRONIC VOTING UP AND DONE THE 
COUNTRY WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF 
ISSUES THERE AND THE RELIABILITY 
AND SECURITY OF THOSE SYSTEMS AND 
FINALLY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE 
ISSUE OF FINANCE IN ELECTIONS AND 
PARTICULARLY THE WAY IN WHICH MONEY 
CAN DETERMINE THE OUTCOMES IN 
GENERAL ELECTIONS IN CERTAIN KEY 
MARGINAL SEATS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
NEEDS TO BE DONE 
IN THE SHORT TERM 
AND MEDIUM TERM WE NEED TO LOOK AT 
THE SYSTEM IN PLACE IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND WHERE THEY USE A SYSTEM OF 
INDIVIDUAL REGISTRATION RATHER 
THAN HOUSEHOLD REGISTRATION WHERE 
ALL VOTERS ARE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE 
PHOTOGRAPHIC I. D. THEY VOTE AND 
THERE HAS TO BE GOOD MEDICAL 
GROUNDS TO GET A POSTAL VOTE IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND 
WE CAN TALK NOW 
TO THE SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY 
NICK HERBERT NO ONE COMES OUT OF 
THIS LOOKING PARTICULARLY WELL BUT 
YOU CAN REASSURE PEOPLE IF YOU 
WANTED TO ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD DO 
TO FIX THE PROBLEM 
WE HAVE 
REPEATEDLY SAID THERE SHOULD BE A 
SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL VOTER 
REGISTRATION WHICH IS WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
IT HAS SECURED THE INTEGRITY OF THE 
BALLOT AND IT IS WIDELY REGARDED 
TO HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS ALL THE 
INDEPENDENT BODIES INCLUDING THE 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION ITSELF HAS 
SAID THAT IT HAS WORKED AND CALLED 
ON THE GOVERNMENT TO INTRODUCE IT 
AND WHAT IS INEXAPPLICABLE IS WHY 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT TAKEN THIS 
FORWARD THERE IS CLEARLY A NEED 
THERE HAVE BEEN THE CASES OF 
ELECTORAL FRAUD TO WHICH YOU HAVE 
REFERRED AND WE HAD THE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION SAYING A COUPLE OF YEARS 
AGO THAT WE HAD FRAUD THAT WOULD 
DISGRACE A BANANA REPUBLIC THIS IS 
IN A SYSTEM OF VOTING IN WHICH WE 
ONCE HAD CONFIDENCE AND I THINK NO 
LONGER CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE SO SO TORIES WOULD INTRODUCE INDIVIDUAL 
VOTER REGISTRATION IF YOU GOT IN 
WE ARE COMMITTED TO INDIVIDUAL 
VOTER REGISTRATION WE HAVE SAID 
THAT REPEATEDLY AND I'M CALLING ON 
THE GOVERNMENT TO GET ON WITH IT 
TODAY THEY NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM 
THE SHORT TERM GIMMICKS TO DRIVE UP 
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE VOTING WHICH HAVE 
BEEN CRITICISED IN THIS REPORT BY 
THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION AS NOT 
WORKING AND POTENTIALLY UNDERMINING 
THE BALLOT STILL FURTHER WITH THEIR 
EXPERIMENTS ON E. VOTING AND 
INSTEAD THEY NEED TO FOCUS ON 
FIRSTLY SECURING THE BALLOT BUT 
SECONDLY FIND THE RIGHT WAY TO RE 
BUILD TRUST IN POLITICS AND RE 
BUILD ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION 
IN ELECTIONS AND THAT IS NOT BY 
THESE GIMMICKY DEVICES 
WOULD YOU 
COUNT POSTAL VOTING AS GIMMICKY WE 
ASKED SOMEBODY FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
TO COME ON THE PROGRAMME AND THEY 
DECLINED BUT THEY WOULD SAY IT HAS 
INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN VOTING 
WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON THAT THE THE POINT IS IF YOU HAVE POSTAL VOTING 
COMBINED WITH INDIVIDUAL 
REGISTRATION THAT WOULD ALLAY THE 
CONCERNS WITHOUT INDIVIDUAL VOTER 
REGISTRATION THERE IS PLAINLY 
GREATER RISK FROM THE INCREASE OF 
POSTAL VOTING ON DEMAND IT GO BACK 
TO THIS KEY RECOMMENDATION THAT HAS 
BEEN MADE BY THE INDEPENDENT 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION FOR 
INDIVIDUAL REGISTRATION WHICH IS 
EASY FOR VOTERS TO DO THEY SIMPLY 
HAVE TO PRODUCE THEIR NATIONAL 
INSURANCE NUMBERS WE HAVE SEEN 
THAT CAN RE BUILD CONFIDENCE WHY 
IS THE GOVERNMENT SETTING ITS FACE 
AGAINST THIS 
NIGEL FARAGE INDIVIDUAL VOTER 
REGISTRATION AND I. D. IS THAT 
SOMETHING YOU WOULD SUPPORT 
ABSOLUTELY WE'VE PROVED IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND WE CAN REFORM 
THESE THINGS BUT THE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION WAS SET UP IN TWO THOUSAND TO 
CLEAN UP BRITISH POLITICS THEY 
SEEM TO A SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME 
ATTACKING PARTIES LIKE US FOR 
MAKING INNOCENT ERRORS THEY NEED 
TO BE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR TODAY 
AND THIS SYSTEM THIS ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION IT REALLY ISN'T WORKING 
SOMETHING ELSE THAT THE REPORT 
HIGHLIGHTED WHICH IS SOMETHING 
THAT LABOUR HAS RIFD THE TORIES FOR 
HAS CRITICISED THE TORIES FOR IN 
PARTICULAR IS THROWING LARGE 
AMOUNTS OF MONEY AT MARGINAL SEATS 
THEY SAY THAT NEGLECTS OTHER SEATS 
AND LEADS TO LOWER TURNOUT IN OTHER 
SEATS BECAUSE THEY FEEL 
DISENFRANCHISED THAT IS SOMETHING 
THAT ONE LORD HAS BEEN DOING IN 
PARTICULAR IN THE TORY PARTY WHAT 
IS YOUR ANSWER TO THAT I'M I'M INTERESTING THAT EVERYBODY ALWAYS 
MENTIONS LORD ASHCROFT WHO HAS 
GIVEN MONEY TO THE TORY PARTY BUT 
LORD SAINSBURY HAS GIVEN LARGE 
AMOUNTS TO THE LABOUR PARTY SO SO YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SPEND ON 
MARGINAL SEATS TO EXCESS 
ON AN 
ANNUAL BASIS BUT THERE IS A HUGE 
DISCREPANCY BY WHAT IS EFFECTIVELY 
BEING SPENT BY MEMBERS OF 
PARLIAMENT ON PARTY FUNDS THE 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASED 
HUGELY THE AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT 
CAN BE SPENT BY SITTING M. P.'S IN 
DEFENCE OF THEIR SEATS AND I THINK 
IT IS THEREFORE RIGHT THAT 
INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATES SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO RAISE SUMS OF MONEY FOR 
THEIR CAMPAIGNS PROPERLY DECLARE 
THOSE SUMS OF MONEY AND FIGHT 
ROBUST CAMPAIGNS WHEN THE REAL 
DISCREPANCY IS WHAT THE STATE 
RAISES FOR THE CANDIDATES AND 
BUT YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED THE 
QUESTION THAT OTHER SEATS FEEL 
NEGLECTED WHEN YOU CONCENTRATE ON 
OTHERS 
WELL OBVIOUSLY SEATS WHERE OTHERS THE FEAREST BATTLES WILL BE FOUGHT 
WILL BE MARGINAL SEATS SO I'M NOT 
SURE I ACCEPT THAT CRITICISM BUT 
WE'VE CALLED FOR THE UNIVERSAL CAP 
ON DONATIONS AND THE GOVERNMENT 
WON'T ACCEPT IT AND THE QUESTION 
IS WHY WE ALL KNOW WHY BECAUSE IT 
WOULD STOP THE UNION FUNDING OF THE 
LABOUR PARTY AND I THINK IT'S TIME 
THEY PUT THE NATIONAL INTEREST HERE 
AHEAD OF THEIR OWN PARTY INTEREST 
WHICH IS WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE 
DOING 
PARTY FUNDING IS A SUBJECT DOING WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO BUT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
A QUICK BRAIN TEASER FOR TODAY 
RELATED TO NIGEL FARAGE TODAY'S 
QUESTION IS 
AT THE END OF THE PROGRAMME NIGEL 
WILL GIVE US THE CORRECT PROGRAMME 
I HOPE 
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEND US 
YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT ANY OF TODAY'S 
STORIES IN THE MEANTIME GET IN 
TOUCH AND WE'LL READ OUT SOME OF 
YOUR THOUGHTS LATER IN THE 
PROGRAMME PROGRAMME NOW I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT GORDON 
BROWN IS IT NOT HAVE THE MOST 
RELAXING OF WEEKENDS AND WITH JUST 
DAY TO GO UNTIL HIS FIRST TEST AT 
THE POLLS AS PRIME MINISTER IT IS 
HARD TO SEE HOW THINGS COULD NOT 
GET ANY BETTER 
IT STARTED WITH LORD LEVY SAYING 
THAT GORDON BROWN HAD BEEN 
DISAPPOINTING AND INDECISIVE HE 
ALSO WENT ON TO SAY THAT TONY BLAIR 
SAID GORDON BROWN COULD NEVER BEAT 
DAVID CAMERON BUT THE EX P. M. DENIES 
THIS DAVID MILIBAND POPPED UP 
CALLING ON THE PARTY TO DEFEND THE 
LEADER SAYING THE CURRENT PROBLEMS 
WERE A TEST OF CHARACTER AS WELL AS 
POLICY POLICY TO COMPOUND THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
MISERY TWO I. C. M. POLLS ON SUNDAY 
SHOWED THAT DAVID CAMERON'S ASSAULT 
ON BROWN IS BEARING FRUIT THEY 
SUGGESTED THE TORIES WOULD WIN A 
COMFORTABLE MAJORITY SHOULD THE 
GENERAL ELECTION BE HELD NOW SO 
CAN GORDON BROWN BOUNCE BACK AND 
WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD RESULT FOR HIM 
IN THIS WEEK'S ELECTIONS OR FOR 
DAVID CAMERON WE'VE BEEN JOINED 
NOW BY ANNE MCELVOY OF THE LONDON 
EVENING STANDARD AND ANDREW PORTER 
FROM THE TELEGRAPH CAN GORDON 
BROWN PULL IT ROUND 
I THINK IT 
LARGELY DEPENDS ON THE RESULTS OF 
THE MAY FIRST ELECTIONS LOCALLY AND 
IN LONDON BUT IT DEPENDS ON HOW 
THEY ARE INTERPRETED BECAUSE THE 
PROBLEM FOR GORDON BROWN IS THAT 
EVERY TIME HE TRIES TO RALLY 
SOMETHING ELSE COMES AND CUTS AWAY 
MORE GROUND FROM BENEATH HIM WE'VE 
HAD LOVE LEVY'S ATTACK PETER 
MANDELSON NOT SOUNDING ABSOLUTELY 
CONFIDENT THAT IT CAN BE MAKING THE 
GROUND THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY SAYING 
STICK WITH GORDON BROWN BUT WE 
NEED TO SUPPORT HIM I THINK IT IS 
GETTING STICKY FOR GORDON BROWN 
AND NOBODY CHEERING FROM THE 
BENCHES AT THE MOMENT AND YOU HAVE 
A LOT OF CONTACT WITH THE BACKBENCH 
LABOUR M. P.'S ARE THEY GEARING UP TO 
TRY AND DITCH HIM OR RESIGNED TO 
THE FACT THAT HE IS NEAR UNTIL THE 
NEXT ELECTION 
I THINK THE LATTER 
IF THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMEBODY 
ELSE THEY COULD RALLY AROUND THEY 
MIGHT DO IT BUT THOSE PEOPLE DON'T 
HAVE THE SUPPORT IN THE LABOUR 
PARTY TO DO IT THEY REALISE THAT 
GORDON BROWN WILL BE THERE UNTIL 
THE NEXT ELECTION AND HE HAS TO 
REGAIN AUTHORITY OVER THE 
PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY YOU SAW 
IT LAST WEEK OVER THE TEN P. TAX THEY 
WERE IN OPEN REBELLION AND IF THEY 
THINK THEY CAN GAIN GROUND ON OTHER 
MATTERS THEY'LL GO FOR IT GORDON 
BROWN WILL SAY HE STUCK TO HIS GUNS 
ON THE FORTY TWO DAY VOTE ON THE TERROR 
ASPECTS BUT A DIVIDED PARTY AS 
THE POLLS IN THE TELEGRAPH SHOWED 
IS A PARTY HEADING FOR ELECTORAL 
DISASTER 
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DISASTER THIS VISION THING AND PETER 
MANDELSON SAID YOU CAN'T JUMP FROM 
ONE BAND BANDWAGON TO THE NEXT HOW 
BIG A PROBLEM IS THAT 
THAT IS A 
VERY FUNDAMENTAL ATTACK AND IS EVEN 
RUDER THAN IT SOUNDS BECAUSE IF 
YOU REMEMBER WHEN GORDON BROWN WAS 
AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POPULARITY IN 
THE SUMMER AND JUST AFTER THE 
SUMMER IT WAS WHEN HE WAS JUMPING 
ON BANDWAGONS AND RESPONDING TO 
HEADLINES IN THE PAPERS 
AND IT 
WORKED 
BRIEFLY BUT THERE IS SOME WORKED TRUTH IN WHAT PETER MANDELSON IS 
SAYING IT IS IF YOU LIKE A 
VITAMIN SHOT BUT IT DOESN'T KEEP 
YOU GOING YOU HAVE TO HAVE A 
CLEARER NARRATIVE BECAUSE YOU'RE 
ASKING FOR A FOURTH TERM IT IS A 
BIG ASK YOU HAVE TO BE CLEAR ON 
WHY YOU WANT IT AND WHAT YOU ARE 
GOING TO DO ON IT AND THAT ATTACK 
WAS REALLY ON HOW GORDON BROWN 
MANAGED THE TRANSITION OF POWER 
FROM TONY BLAIR TO GORDON BROWN 
LET'S TURN TO THE ELECTIONS ON 
THURSDAY NOT THAT MANY SEATS UP 
THIS YEAR BUT IT IS INEVITABLY 
BEING SEEN AS A BIT OF A 
BELLWEATHER AS TO WHAT IS GOING ON 
POLITICALLY ANDREW WHAT WOULD BE 
A GOOD RESULT FOR GORDON BROWN ON 
SNURS 
I THINK THE THING HE IS SNURS REALLY KEEPING HIS FINGERS CROSSED 
FOR IS A WIN FOR KEN LIVINGSTONE IN 
LONDON KEN LIVINGSTONE AND GORDON 
BROWN ARE NOT POLITICAL SOUL MATES 
BUT FOR ONCE GORDON BROWN IS 
REALLY REALLY HOPING KEN 
LIVINGSTONE WILL PULL SOMETHING OUT 
IN LONDON IF HE WINS IT WILL NOT 
ONLY GIVE GORDON BROWN A BREATHING 
SPACE BUT IT WILL STOP DAVID 
CAMERON IN HIS TRACKS BECAUSE THIS 
IS REALLY THE FIRST TEST AND WE 
KNOW THEY CAN ALL SPIN ELECTION 
RESULTS BOTH WAYS ALSO 
AND WE 
HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS IS AGAINST 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHICH WAS THE HEIGHT OF THE 
ANTI IRAQ FEELING WITH TONY BLAIR 
SO IF THEY LOSE SEATS AFTER THAT 
THEY HAVE GONE BADLY WRONG THERE 
ARE VERY LOW EXPECTATIONS L. WOULD 
AGREE WITH ANDREW AND I WOULD GO 
FURTHER IN LONDON IF KEN LOSES IN 
LONDON I THINK THAT WOULD PUT THE 
SKIDS ON GORDON BROWN BECAUSE IT 
WOULD BRING THE PERCEPTION THAT IF 
BORIS JOHNSON WINS IN LONDON WHOM 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T THINK HE CAN 
IT WOULD BE A FEAR BLOW TO GORDON 
BROWN AND HIS AUTHORITY NIGEL IF IF KEN LOSES IN LONDON ON THURSDAY I 
SUSPECT THE COLLECTIVE DISCIPLINE 
ON THE LABOUR BACKBENCHES WOULD 
START TO MELT AND WE MIGHT GET THE 
ODD VOICE CALLING FOR RESIGNATION 
AND I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF GORDON 
BROWN WOULD SURVIVE TO THE NEXT 
ELECTIONS 
DAVID CAMERON HIS SHOWING WHAT 
WOULD BE A GOOD RESULT FOR HIM I I THINK HIS POSITION IS GEOGRAPHICAL 
IS HE MAKING INROADS ON PARTS THAT 
THE TORY DON'T USUALLY REACH GIVEN GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING HIM 
SHOULD HE BE MAKING PROGRESS RATHER 
THAN RELYING ON THE OTHER GUY TO 
LOSE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HE WILL 
LOOK AT A POLL EIGHTEEN POINTS AHEAD AND 
THINK THAT'S PRETTY GOOD 
PROGRESS 
THINK THAT'S PRETTY GOOD PROGRESS THE U. K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY MAY NOT 
EXPECT TO DO PARTICULARLY WELL 
THEY HAVE PUT FORWARD LESS 
CANDIDATES THAN PLAID CYMRU BUT 
BOB SPINK GAVE THE PARTY A BOOST 
WHEN HE HE SWITCHED WHAT DID HIS 
CONSTITUENTS MAKE OF THE SWITCH 
SPRING HAS ARRIVED IN THE ESSEX 
CONSTITUENCY NIGEL FARAGE SAID HE 
WAS DELIGHTED TO WELCOME THE HARD 
WORKING AND DEEPLY PRINCIPLED BOB 
SPINK AS UKIP'S FIRST MEMBER OF 
PARLIAMENT WE'RE HERE TO ASK SOME 
OF MR. SPINK'S CONSTITUENTS WHAT 
THEY THINK OF THE MOVE ERIC SMITH 
IS CHAIRMAN OF THE GOLF CLUB AND 
VOTED FOR BOB SPINK LAST TIME DO 
YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE A BY 
ELECTION 
I'M FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. ON THAT A ELECTION SINGLE M. P. IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE 
THE POLICIES OF THE COUNTRY IN 
PURIST TERMS I WOULD SAY YES THE 
MAJORITY VOTING FOR HIM HERE WOULD 
HAVE VOTED FOR HIM BECAUSE THEY 
WANTED A TORY GOVERNMENT L. BELIEVE 
WE'RE BEING RIPPED OFF BY THE E. U. 
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY CAN'T WIN A 
GENERAL ELECTION 
SHOULD WE PULL 
OUT OF THE E. U. YES 
MARK SAUL IS THE YES OWNER OF CAFE MAX 
I HAVE FOUND BOB 
SPINK TO BE 
A GOOD M. P. L. DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE PARTY HE HAS JOINED 
DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE A BY 
ELECTION 
I THINK WE SHOULD BE ELECTION GIVEN A CHANCE TO VOTE AGAIN A 
LIKE MYSELF A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T 
KNOW ABOUT THIS PARTY 
ABOUT UKIP 
IF I WAS TO SAY THE POLICIES ARE TO 
WITHDREW FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION I I WOULD BE IN AGREEMENT WITH T. H. A T. ZERO ZERO PER CENT 
I BELIEVE BRITAIN IS TOO INVOLVED 
IN EUROPE 
I VOTED FOR BOB SPINK 
RATHER THAN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE A BY 
ELECTION 
NO THE REASON WHAT BOB ELECTION SPINK STANDS FOR IS WHAT MOST OF 
HIS CONSTITUENTS SUPPORT IF HE HAD 
DEFECTED TO LABOUR I WOULD SAY 
YES BUT BECAUSE HE DEFECTED TO 
UKIP I MY PERSONAL OPINION IS NO 
DO YOU KNOW BOB SPINK HAS LEFT THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND WENT TO UKIP 
NO 
DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR YOU'RE NO REPRESENTED BY AN M. P. STANDING FOR A 
DIFFERENT PARTY 
NO IT'S NOT FAIR 
SHOULD THERE BE A BY ELECTION NO NO IT'S NOT FAIR L. L. VOTED CONSERVATIVE 
RATHER THAN SPINK 
I THINK THERE 
SHOULD BE A BY ELECTION L. VOTED 
FOR THE PARTY RATHER THAN THE 
INDIVIDUAL 
THE UKIP CANDIDATE HERE INDIVIDUAL AT THE LOST GENERAL ELECTION CAME 
FOURTH BOB SPINK HAS A COMFORTABLE 
MAJORITY IN CASTLEPOINT THE 
QUESTION IS HE WILL DO THEY 
NEXT ELECTION WHEN THAT TURNS OUT 
TO BE UKIP'S LEADER NIGEL FARAGE 
IS STILL WITH ME SOMETHING THAT 
CAME OUT CLEARLY FROM THE FILM 
EVEN 
IF PEOPLE ARE SYMPATHETIC TO 
UKIP'S VIEWS ON EUROPE THEY STILL 
WANT A TORY M. P. REALITY IS UKIP IS 
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE IN POWER 
TO INFLUENCE THINGS THE TORIES 
MIGHT BE 
BOB SPINK IS A VOICE IN 
THE U. K. WHO WILL STAND UP HARD FOR 
BRITAIN TO BE FREE OF THE EUROPEAN 
UNION AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS HE 
WAS ELECTED TO HE HAS NOT CHANGED 
A SINGLE POLICY ON WHICH HE WAS 
ELECTED THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN 
WHICH AN M. P. CHANGING SIDES SHOULD 
BE RE ELECTED IF SOMEBODY ELECTED 
ON MICHAEL HOWARD'S PARTY AND WENT 
TO THE LABOUR PARTY YOU COULD 
ARGUE FOR IT THE CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY HAS CHANGED SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND 
NOT BOB SPINK 
CAN'T YOU SEE HOW 
SOME MIGHT FEEL CHEATED THEY 
ELECTED SOMEONE WHO COULD HAVE 
FORMED THE NEXT GOVERNMENT AND NOW 
HAVE SOMEONE WHO WILL NEVER BE IN 
GOVERNMENT 
THE CONSERVATIVES DID GOVERNMENT NOT WIN THE LAST ELECTION HE'S 
THERE UNTIL THE NEXT GENERAL 
ELECTION HE WILL FIGHT AS UKIP 
AND BOB SPINK AND HE WILL FIGHT ON 
A SET OF POLICY THAT THE MAJORITY 
OF HIS CONSTITUENTS WILL AGREE WITH 
THEY WILL HAVE TO DECIDE COME THE 
NEXT ELECTION WHOM THEY WILL 
RETURN THIS IS IS A VERY HARD 
WORKING MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT AND A 
WELL KNOWN MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT 
DON'T WRITE HIM OFF 
I DON'T THINK 
ANYBODY IS SUGGESTING THAT AT ALL 
YOU SAY COME THE NEXT GENERAL 
ELECTION THEY CAN VOTE FOR HIM 
YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HONESTY 
WHY DON'T YOU PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE 
THE MOUTH IS AND CALL A BY ELECTION 
WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON WHO CALLED 
A BY ELECTION TO RE WHEN HE 
RESIGNED HIS SEAT 
THAT DOESN'T 
MATTER 
HE WAS ELECTED AS BOB SPINK MATTER ON HIS MANIFESTO HE STUCK TO THE 
MANIFESTO AND HE IS CONFIDENT VERY 
FEW OF HIS CONSTITUENTS WELL WANT 
REALLY WANT TO GO THROUGH A BY 
ELECTION 
ON HIS ELECTION WAS HE ELECTION CAMPAIGNING A STKPWRESIVELY TO GET 
OUT OF EUROPE 
NOT REALLY HE 
DIDN'T MENTION THE WORD 
CONSERVATIVE ON THE ELECTION 
ADDRESS HE WANTED THEM TO VOTE FOR 
BOB SPINK HE WAS TALKING ABOUT 
RENEGOTIATING BRITAIN'S POSITION IN 
THE U. K. HE'S NOW ABLE TO DO THAT 
HONESTY HE DIDN'T 
TO GET HONESTY BRITAIN OUT OF THE EWAN WHEN HE WAS 
ELECTED 
IF ANYBODY SHOULD BE ELECTED CALLING BY ELECTIONS IT SHOULD BE 
LIBERAL M. P.'S WHO LABOUR M. P.'S WHO SAID 
THEY WOULD GIVE US A REFERENDUM 
THAT'S DISHONESTY IN POLITICS THE THE M. P.'S IN WESTMINSTER HAVE BEEN UNDER 
THE SPOTLIGHT A LOT ABOUT EXPENSES 
LAST WEEK EUROPEAN POLITICIANS 
VOTED NOT TO DISCLOSE THEIR 
EXPENSES EVEN THOUGH THEY 
ALLOWED TO SPEND UPWARDS OF 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND A YEAR ON STAFF DO YOU 
THINK THAT'S FAIR GIVEN WHAT HAS 
BEEN HAPPENING OVER EXPENSES WE WE HAVE BEEN ARGUING FOR YEARS AND 
YEARS ANY TALK OF REFORMING THE 
EWAN IS NEVER GOING TO WORK AND 
PERHAPS THE BEST EVIDENCE IS THE 
FACT HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNED UP FOR 
THE AUDITORS IF YOU ARE LOOKING 
FOR REFORMS TO COME FROM BRUSSELS 
DON'T EXPECT IT TO BE THERE AND 
COME HERE 
DID YOU VOTE WAS HERE 
IN THE U. K. WELCOMING BOB 
THE DAY WE HAD THE VOTE NOTHING IS 
GOING TO CHANGE LAST WEEK THE 
EUROPEAN COMMISSION ANNOUNCED THAT 
THE NEW COMMISSIONER IN CHARGE OF 
THE JUSTICE BRIEF IS MR. JACK 
BARROA WHO WAS CONVICTED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN 
YOU EMPLOY YOUR SON AS A RESEARCHER 
NO I DON'T 
DID YOU 
NEVER HAVE 
NEVER EMPLOYED MY SON WHO DOES AWAY 
AT YUEFRTD IN ANY CAPACITY WHAT WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE 
SHE WORKS FOR ME 
AND HAS DONE FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF 
YEARS IF I WAS WORKING UP TO ONE HUNDRED 
HOURS A WEEK TRAVELLING ALL OVER 
THE U. K. AND EUROPE I NEED 
SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH AND 
SECRETARIAL SUPPORT AT HOME SURELY SURELY SOMEONE OUTSIDE YOUR FAMILY CAN 
PROVIDE THAT YOU CAMPAIGN HEAVILY 
ON ANTI GRAVY TRAIN AND YOU EMPLOY 
A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY 
I WAS 
THERE FOR SEVEN YEARS NOT 
EMPLOYING HER SHE WORKED AS AN 
UNPAID BASIS SINCE I'VE BECOME A 
MEP AND IN THIS COUNTRY THE 
SUPPORT I NEED THAT SUPPORT YOU YOU CAN'T USE SOMEBODY ELSE 
THAT MEANS 
SOMEBODY ELSE COMING INTO YOUR HOME 
WE HAVE NO DIFFICULTY DECLARING WHO 
WE EMPLOY AND WHO WORKS FOR US 
NONE WHATSOEVER 
WHAT WOULD BE A 
GOOD RESULT FOR YOU 
TO WIN COUNCIL 
SEATS AND RETAIN SEATS IN THE 
LONDON ASSEMBLY NUMBERS 
IN TERMS NUMBERS OF COUNCIL SEATS IT WON'T BE VERY 
MANY WE WON TWO SEATS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND 
WE'RE FIGHTING TO RETAIN THE SEATS 
YOU'LL NOT MAKES GAINS 
WE'LL NOT 
MAKE GAINS IN TWO THOUSAND IT COINCIDED 
WITH THE EUROPEAN ELECTION IT'S 
HARDER FOR US TO PUT THOSE THINGS 
ON THE AGENDA IT SHOULD NOT BE 
POST OFFICE CLOSURE AND ARE ALL 
RELATED TO THE E. U. NOT EVERYONE SEES 
THAT 
THANKS FOR THE E. MAILS LOTS THAT E. MAILING ABOUT ELECTORAL FRAUD 
ONE SUGGESTS HAVING POLLS ON A 
SUNDAY RATHER THAN A WEEKDAY 
ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY IN EUROPE 
COPES WITH THE STAFFING TMEDO IT 
WOULD MINIMISE DISRUPTION WITH 
SCHOOLS AND HE ADDS I WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE IT MADE COMPULSORY AND 
ANOTHER THIS IS NOT NEWS WHAT IS 
SCANDALOUS IS THAT THE SITUATION IS 
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE HE THINKS IT 
SHOWS THE CONTEMPT IN WHICH 
POLITICIANS HOLD US THE VOTERS 
AND DAVID TAILOR LET'S FACE IT 
GORDON THE STEALTH TAXER HAS BEEN 
RUMBLED BIG TIME IT'S HIS NOT MR. 
DARLING TEN P. TAX DECISION AND IT 
WILL COST HIM 
AS THE STRIKE AT GRANGEMOUTH GOES 
INTO THE SECOND DAY THERE ARE 
REPORTS THAT THE COST OF PETROL AT 
STATION FORECOURTS COULD REMAIN 
HIGHER THAN NORMAL FOR ANOTHER SIX 
WEEKS AT THE START OF THE YEAR A 
LITRE COST AN AVERAGE OF ONE POINT OH THREE AND 
THE LATEST FIGURES SHOW IT HAS GONE 
UP TO ONE POINT OH NINE AND IT IS ONE POINT TWO OH AT 
SOME FORECOURTS TOMORROW HAULIERS 
WILL BE PROTESTING OVER THE FUEL 
MR. DAVID HANDLEY WHAT ARE YOU 
PLANNING TO DO 
ALL WE'RE AIMING TO 
DO TOMORROW IS TO KEEP THE ISSUE OF 
FUEL TAXATION AND WHAT IT IS DOING 
TO BOTH INDUSTRIES HIGH ON THE 
GOVERNMENT'S AGENDA 
THAT WILL 
INVOLVE YOU DRIVING TRUCKS AND FARM 
VEHICLES INTO WHITEHALL CERTAINLY CERTAINLY SOME VEHICLES WILL BE BROUGHT INTO 
LONDON TOMORROW THEY'RE COMING TO 
PARBG LANE AND UNDER MARBLE ARCH 
THERE WILL BE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
FROM WITHIN THE INDUSTRY GIVING 
THEIR VIEWS AND WE WILL GO TO THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS WHERE WE INTEND 
TO MEET WITH SOME M. P.'S AND PASS ON 
DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE TO SHOW WHAT 
THE HIGH TAXATION IS DOING NOT ONLY 
TO THE FARMING INDUSTRY BUT THE 
HAULIER OAGE INDUSTRY BOTH OF US 
WORK HAND IN HAND ONE CAN'T 
OPERATE WITHOUT THE OTHER WHAT WHAT SENSE DO YOU GET OF HIGH HOW HIGH 
FEELINGS ARE RUNNING IN THE WIDER 
COUNTRY NOT JUST AMONG HAULIERS 
AND FARMERS 
CERTAINLY FROM MY OWN 
ORGANISATION FARMERS FOR ACTION 
WE'RE GETTING MANY PHONE CALLS E. 
MAILS ON A DETAIL BASIS OF HOW THIS 
IS CAUSING AN IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S 
INDIVIDUAL LIVES AND BUSINESSES L. 
DON'T THINK IT'S SUSTAINABLE AND I 
THINK GOVERNMENT HAVE GOT TO 
ADDRESS THE SITUATION WE'RE IN A 
POSITION WHERE TOMORROW WE'RE 
EXPECTING B. P. AND ROYAL DUTCH TO 
COME OUT WITH FIGURES ON THE FIRST 
QUARTER OF ANYTHING UP TO THIRTY PER CENT 
INCREASE ON LAST YEAR WHICH 
CLEARLY SHOWS THE OIL COMPANIES ARE 
NOT SUFFERING WE KNOW THROUGH 
TAXATION GOVERNMENT IS NOT WHY DO 
WE HAVE TO SEE INDUSTRIES PUT OUT 
OF BUSINESS WHILE NOTHING SEEMS TO 
BE BEING DONE ABOUT IT 
THOSE LARGE 
PROFITS WILL BE TAXED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT PROVIDE REVENUE TWENTY THREE 
BILLION WAS RAISED THROUGH FUEL 
DUTIES IF YOU CUT THAT WHERE IS 
THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING WHERE IS 
THE MURN GOING TO COME FROM LET'S 
HAVE OPEN BOOK KEEPING AND SEE 
WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING MY 
UNDERSTANDING IS ANYTHING DERIVED 
FROM ROAD AND FUEL TAXATION SHOULD 
BE GOING INTO THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF 
THE ROADS WE DRIVE UPON AND 
IMPROVING IT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING 
DO YOU SEE ANOTHER FUEL PROTEST 
HAPPENING 
THAT'S AN OPTION WE HAPPENING HOPE WE DON'T GET TO THAT WHAT IS 
GOING ON IN GRANGEMOUTH IS SHOWING 
THERE ARE FEELINGS RUNNING VERY 
HIGH AND SOMEONE IN GOVERNMENT HAS 
TO ADDRESS IT 
WE MUST LEAVE IT 
THERE THANK YOU TIME TO GO TO 
FIND OUT ANSWER TO 
THERE THANK YOU TIME TO GO TO FIND OUT ANSWER TO 
THE QUIZ NIGEL
