I THINK A GOOD TEACHER IS SOME 
I THINK A GOOD TEACHER SHOULD TELL YOU OFF BECAUSE THEN SOMETIMES 
YOU LEARNED FROM THAT NOT TO DO BAD THINGS 
SOMEONE WHO'S KIND AND DOESN'T KEEP YOU IN FOR PLAYTIME 
I THINK A GOOD TEACHER IS POLITE AND GIVES YOU VERY VERY HARD WORK 
AND SHE DON'T GIVE ANYONE ANY PLAYTIME 
I THINK A GOOD TEACHER IS SOMEONE 
WHO ENCOURAGES YOU TO DO BORING WORK
