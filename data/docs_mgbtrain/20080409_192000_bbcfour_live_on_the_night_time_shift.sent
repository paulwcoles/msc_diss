FOUR THREE 
GOOD EVENING ALL ARMED POLICE 
WATCH A T. V. DRAMA TODAY AND YOU CAN EXPECT BLEMISH FREE PERFORMANCES 
AND A POLISHED PRODUCTION THAT'S ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT'S RECORDED 
BUT THE FIRST T. V. DRAMAS HAD TO GET IT RIGHT LIVE ON THE NIGHT 
JUST BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION THERE WOULD BE 
SILENCE IN THE STUDIO PLEASE 
GOING LIVE STAND BY 
GOING OUT LIVE REALLY JUST MADE IT COMPLETELY REAL 
IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WHEN THE CAMERA WAS ON IN Z. CARS YOU FELT ALL THAT EIGHTEEN MILLION PEOPLE 
CUE AND CUT 
TONIGHT TIMESHIFT TELLS THE STORY OF THE OFTEN AMBITIOUS BEGINNINGS OF LIVE T. V. DRAMA 
IT'S ALSO THE STORY OF HOW TELEVISION IS REDISCOVERING THE POWER OF LIVE DRAMA 
YAH H. H. 
IT WAS SO AMBITIOUS AND YOU KNEW YOU COULDN'T DO IT AGAIN 
I DON'T THINK THERE'LL BE MANY PEOPLE WORKING IN DRAMA 
WHO HAVEN'T FANTASISED ABOUT DOING SOMETHING LIVE ON TELEVISION 
GOOD LUCK STUDIO 
AND YOU WENT URGH H. YOUR GUTS WENT INTO YOUR HEART 
ALL RIGHT STAND BY THEN PLEASE STAND BY 
ABSOLUTE QUIET 
QUIET QUIET 
WELCOME TO A FIRST NEVER BEFORE HAVE WE TRIED TO BRING YOU 
LIVE UNCUT THEATRE PERFORMANCE OF SHAKESPEARE 
IN TWO THOUSAND THREE 
B. B. C. FOUR BROADCAST SHAKESPEARE LIVE FROM LONDON'S GLOBE THEATRE 
SPEAK COMFORTABLE WORDS SHOULD I DO SO I SHOULD BELIE MY THOUGHTS 
COMFORT'S IN HEAVEN WE ARE ON THE EARTH 
THE EVENT WAS SUBCONSCIOUSLY DRAWING ON T. V. DRAMA'S THEATRICAL BEGINNINGS 
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE B. B. C. 
ONE OF THE FIRST OUTSIDE BROADCASTS CAME FROM SAINT MARTIN'S THEATRE LONDON 
IT WAS A RELAY OF THE NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT PRODUCTION OF A J. B. PRIESTLEY PLAY CALLED WHEN WE ARE MARRIED 
WE'RE ON ONE WE'RE MIXING TO TWO 
ALL PRE WAR T. V. DRAMA WAS FIRMLY ROOTED IN THEATRE 
WITH DOZENS OF FORMAL PRODUCTIONS BROADCAST LIVE FROM ALEXANDRA PALACE 
THE STATION WAS ONLY TRANSMITTING TWENTY TWO HOURS OF PROGRAMMES A WEEK 
BUT SOON AS MUCH AS FOURTEEN HOURS OF THIS WAS LIVE DRAMA 
PRODUCERS IN THOSE FORMATIVE DAYS ONLY HAD THEATRE AS THEIR GUIDE 
THEY HAD NO KIND OF VISUAL LANGUAGE THAT THEY COULD DRAW ON 
AND THEY LOOKED TO THE THEATRE FOR DIRECTORS INITIALLY 
SO THEY ALSO CAME FROM THE SAME KIND OF POOL 
CURRENTLY ON STAGE IN THE MOUSETRAP AT THE ORIGINAL SAINT MARTIN'S THEATRE 
IS ONE OF THOSE REPERTORY ACTORS 
PETER BYRNE LEARNED TO USE THE NEW TECHNOLOGY OF T. V. IN THE EARLY YEARS 
NOT HAVING AN AUDIENCE 
WAS A DRAWBACK TO SOME ACTORS IN THE EARLY DAYS OF TELEVISION 
I CAME OUT OF WEEKLY REP OUT OF THE THEATRE 
AND TELEVISION WAS IN ITS INFANCY 
WHAT DET SGT CRAWFORD 
PETER BYRNE IS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS ROLE IN DIXON OF DOCK GREEN 
BUT HE LEARNED HIS CRAFT ON MANY EARLIER LIVE PRODUCTIONS 
SUDDENLY BEING PITCHFORKED INTO TELEVISION A TOTALLY NEW MEDIUM 
WHICH WAS CONTINUOUS WAS GOING TO BE LIVE THERE WERE GOING TO BE TERRIBLE DISTRACTIONS 
YOU HAD NO YARDSTICK NO BENCHMARK 
AS YOU WENT ALONG 
A LOT OF ACTORS HATED LIVE TELEVISION 
YOU KNOW STAGE ACTORS I LOVED IT 
UM BECAUSE YOU SENSED 
THERE WERE SEVEN MILLION FIFTEEN MILLION HOWEVER MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THERE WERE OUT THERE 
AND THERE WAS THIS SORT OF NERVOUS ENERGY AND IN THE STUDIO THAT UNNATURAL QUIET 
EXCEPT FOR THE SWISHING AND ALL THE NOISE AND MAYHEM 
WELL I'M HEADING WEST MYSELF WITH THE CAPITAL THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWS ME 
AND I'M HOPING ONE DAY TO OWN A FARM MYSELF 
I DID THE NEW CANADIANS 
WE WERE ON BOARD A SHIP EMIGRATING TO CANADA 
AND BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T TAKE US OUT AND STICK US ON A BOAT 
THEY HAD THE STAGEHANDS MOVING THE SCENERY AND ROCKING US GENTLY 
TELL ME WHEN THEY FOUND OUT YOU WERE ENGLISH DID YOU GET LYNCHED WELL I HAD A FEW ANXIOUS MOMENTS 
IT WASN'T JUST THE ACTORS WHO WERE LEARNING AND TRYING TO KEEP GOING BUT IT WAS THE TECHNICIANS AS WELL 
THEY HAD TO EXPERIMENT 
LIVE ON AIR AS THERE WAS NO VIDEO RECORDING THEY DID HAVE REPEATS 
OF A SORT 
REMEMBER NOW WHEN YOU SEE A REPEAT WHEN WE USED TO DO A REPEAT 
YOU HAD TO COME IN AGAIN AND DO IT LIVE 
QUITE OFTEN YOU'D DO THE PERFORMANCE ON TUESDAY AND AGAIN ON FRIDAY 
AND OFTEN THE SHIFT HAD CHANGED YOU MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT CREW 
YOU WERE FIGHTING TIME 
IT WAS LIVING DANGEROUSLY 
GOOD EVENING THIS IS A AN EXCITING MOMENT FOR US IN TELEVISION 
FOR TONIGHT I'M NOT SPEAKING TO YOU FROM ALEXANDRA PALACE 
BUT FROM THE NEW TRANSMITTING STATION AT SUTTON COLDFIELD 
BY THE EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES THE B. B. C. HAD OPENED UP 
TRANSMITTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY MASSIVELY INCREASING T. V. AUDIENCES 
BUT ITS DRAMAS WERE STILL RELYING 
ON A THEATRICAL HERITAGE WHICH DIDN'T ALWAYS MATCH THE TASTE OF THE PUBLIC 
I'VE LOST MY JOB AGAIN MISS ANGEL 
YES AGAIN AND SERVE THEM RIGHT I PRESUME YOU'VE BEEN UNPUNCTUAL 
YOU'RE WRONG IT'S RANK INJUSTICE 
I THINK THE B. B. C. KIND OF HAD TO RETHINK THEIR OUTPUT A LITTLE BIT 
TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE FACT 
AND WHAT THE INTERESTS WOULD BE ACCORDINGLY 
THE ANSWER WAS THE GROVE FAMILY 
BRITAIN'S FIRST T. V. SOAP OPERA 
IT RAN FROM NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR TO NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
AND WAS HUGELY POPULAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO TRAVEL WITH YOU 
IT WAS QUITE AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAMME 
THEY CONCENTRATED WORK IN STUDIO BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO STICK TO THAT 
OCCASIONALLY THE FAMILY WOULD GO OFF ON HOLIDAY OR 
HAVE A VISIT AND THEY EXPERIMENTED WITH USING FILMED INSERTS FOR THIS 
THEY'D DO A SCENE IN STUDIO 
WHEN THAT WAS OVER THEY'D CUT TO A SCENE THEY'D FILMED 
YOUR TURN ON CINE 
AND OFTEN YOU COULD SEE THE JOINS 
AND THE ACTION THEN CLEVERLY LINKED BACK FROM FILM TO STUDIO 
OOH 
HOW LUCKY OF YOU TO PLAY A JOKE SON WHAT'S UP EH 
BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE I. T. V. SO IT WAS ONLY B. B. C. THEN 
AND WE WERE THE FAMILY SERIAL THEN THE FIRST FAMILY SERIAL 
IT WAS EXCITING BECAUSE WE WERE POPULAR THERE WAS RECOGNITION 
AND WE WERE WE WERE ACTING EVERY WEEK 
WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ON BUILDING SITES CALLING OUT HELLO PAT 
ANY MORE BACON PAT NO WOULD YOU TAKE THESE PLATES IN AND WASH UP 
THE GROVE FAMILY GOT ITS NAME BECAUSE IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR 
WHEN IT WAS INTRODUCED 
THE B. B. C. HAD JUST MOVED TO NEW STUDIOS IN LIME GROVE 
THE FAMILY WAS NAMED AFTER THE NEW HOME OF THE B. B. C. 
OFF WE GO THEN HELLO JANE SAY GOODBYE I DON'T THINK SHE'S UP 
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS MOST STRESSFUL LOOKING BACK 
WAS THE JOURNEY BETWEEN SETS' 
YOUR SCENE FINISHED THE RED LIGHT WOULD GO OFF ON THE CAMERA 
AND YOU HAD TO KNOW WHERE YOU WERE GOING WHERE THE NEXT SET WAS 
AND WHERE THE CAMERAS WERE GOING 
BECAUSE THE CAMERAS WOULD HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER 
AND THERE'D BE THIS HUGE SWISHING SOUND AS THE CAMERAMEN 
WITH THE CABLES AND THE CAMERAMEN 
WOULD MANOEUVRE THEIR WAY THROUGH 
AND WE HAD TO AVOID TRIPPING OVER THE CABLES 
GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE APPEARING RELAXED 
CHEER UP GRAN I'M WORRIED 
AND THEN THERE WERE THE COSTUME CHANGES 
SOMETIMES YOU STRIPPED OFF AND GOT THERE AS QUICKLY AS YOU COULD 
MAY I HAVE THE BALL PLEASE 
THE PRESSURE ON ACTORS WAS IMMENSE 
INCLUDING LAST MINUTE SCRIPT CHANGES TO KEEP THE PRODUCTION TO TIME 
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THEY FLUFFED THE ODD LINE 
ANYBODY MIGHT THINK YOU WERE GOING FOR GOOD WE'RE TAKING OUR LINEN 
YOU HAD TO CARRY ON OBVIOUSLY 
NOW LISTEN FOR FIFTY OUT OF FIFTY TWO WEEKS 
BUT THE NATION FORGAVE ANY IMPERFECTIONS 
AND THE GROVE FAMILY EVEN GOT ROYAL APPROVAL WHEN THE QUEEN MOTHER VISITED IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
IT WAS VERY EXCITING 
WHEN WE HEARD THE QUEEN MOTHER ENJOYED IT AND WE CURTSEYED 
I THINK WE CURTSEYED 
IT WAS GREAT FUN FOR US TO THINK 
THAT WE GOT IN THERE IN THE PALACES SOMEWHERE 
DURING THE NINETEEN FIFTIES IMPROVING T. V. TECHNOLOGY 
STARTED TO FREE TECHNICIANS AND DIRECTORS 
FROM THEIR THEATRICAL TRADITIONS 
THEY LEARNED HOW MOVING CAMERAS AND DIFFERENT LENSES 
COULD BE USED FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT 
HORRIBLE SIGHT BUT THERE YOU ARE THAT'S A CLOSE UP WITHOUT MY MOVING 
NOW SPIN TO A LONG SHOT 
AND THERE YOU HAVE A LONG SHOT 
TO EMBRACE THE TECHNOLOGY 
NEW WRITERS WERE BROUGHT IN TO PROVIDE STORIES FOR TELEVISION 
NIGEL KNEALE WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE TRADITIONAL T. V. PLAY 
WITH A DARING PIECE OF LIVE T. V. 
THAT STUNNED VIEWERS 
THE REVOLUTIONARY SCIENCE FICTION SERIES QUATERMASS 
WAS KNEALE'S GRAND VISION TO CREATE DRAMA 
DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING EVER SEEN ON T. V. BEFORE 
THE SORT OF THINGS THEY 
TRADITIONALLY PUT OUT THEN 
TENDED TO BE RATHER SLOW MOVING 
BIT PONDEROUS BUT OURS DIDN'T OURS WENT VERY FAST 
FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE 
ROCKET BOOSTER 
LIVE KNEALE USED AN AMBITIOUS COMBINATION OF LOCATION FILMING 
AND HUGE STUDIO SETS 
CAREFULLY CHOREOGRAPHED CAMERA MOVES GAVE A DYNAMIC FEEL FAR REMOVED FROM THE WORLD OF THEATRE 
WHILE CLOSE UPS DREW VIEWERS INTO THE DETAIL OF THIS SCIENCE FICTION WORLD 
EVERYBODY WAS ABSOLUTELY ENRAPTURED BY IT 
IT WAS THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION THE FOLLOWING MORNING ACROSS THE LAND 
CONTROL TO QUATERMASS INFORMATION PLEASE OVER 
QUATERMASS TO CONTROL VELOCITY THIRTY TWO THOUSAND M. P. H. 
COURSE AS DIRECTED 
WE'RE SUFFERING 
G. EFFECTS 
SHOULD BE A FEW MINUTES OVER 
QUATERMASS WAS DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW BUT THE APPETITE FOR SCIENCE FICTION 
MEANT NIGEL KNEALE'S ADAPTATION OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR 
ALTHOUGH STILL CALLED A PLAY 
WOULD STRETCH THE LIVE STUDIO TO THE LIMIT 
NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WAS THE NEXT BIG JOB 
AND UM 
WE HAD PROPER STUDIOS TO WORK IN 
SO THAT WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE 
IN FACT WE HAD TWO STUDIOS 
NOT JUST ONE FOR THE ACTORS ANOTHER FOR THE ORCHESTRA A LIVE ORCHESTRA 
COMRADES ATTENTION 
EVEN WITH ELABORATE PLANNING A LIVE BROADCAST CAN BE THROWN INTO DISARRAY BY A SIMPLE HICCUP 
LIKE A MISSING PROP AS THE SHOW BEGAN 
SOMEBODY REALISED THAT THE KEY PROP 
WHICH WAS A VICTORIAN PAPERWEIGHT HAD BEEN STOLEN 
PANIC IN THE STUDIO HORROR 
HOW DO YOU SOLVE THIS THE SHOW CAN'T BE STOPPED IT'S ROLLING NOW 
SO THE GIRL HAD THE BEST THING SHE COULD PRODUCE 
WHICH WAS A MICKEY MOUSE SET WITH DROPS OF SNOW INSIDE A GLOBE 
AND THAT IS WHAT APPEARED IN FRONT OF PETER CUSHING 
AND HE HAD LINES TO SAY THIS WAS SO BEAUTIFUL 
IT'S LIKE SNOW FALLING INSIDE THERE 
COURSE IT'S FILLED WITH WATER AND WHITE PARTICLES IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
YES 
VIEWERS WERE BROUGHT BACK TO REALITY IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE 
WHEN ONE OF THE B. B. C.'S LONGEST RUNNING SERIES STARTED ITS BEAT 
OH GOOD EVENING ALL 
WELL I'M THE MUG TONIGHT 
DIXON OF DOCK GREEN HAD A VERY COSY FEEL IT WAS A SMALL NEIGHBOURHOOD 
EVEN AT THE TIME IT WENT OUT IT WAS A SAFE WORLD IT PORTRAYED 
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS 
BUT I THOUGHT I SAW YOU WITH A YOUNG WOMAN FRIDAY NIGHT IT WAS 
OH OH THE WOMAN FROM THE COMMERCIAL ART STUDIO I SUPPOSE 
BUSINESS ACQUAINTANCE EH 
PETER BYRNE AND THE LATE JACK WARNER DEVELOPED TECHNIQUES TO HELP EACH OTHER WITH LIVE PERFORMANCE 
IN EARLY DAYS OF TELEVISION YOU HAD TO KEEP GOING 
IF SOMEBODY DRIED YOU WENT I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING 
TOLD HIM THE LINES AND ON YOU'D GO 
I HAD A SERIES OF SIGNALS WITH JACK 
IF HE DID THIS THAT MEANS I'M NOT TOO SURE OF THE NEXT LINE 
AND IF HE DID THAT HE'D GONE YOU PICKED IT UP FROM THERE 
HELLO YOU TWO 
DIXON OF DOCK GREEN WOULD RUN FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS AND OVER FOUR HUNDRED EPISODES 
SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT SOME OF THE TRANSMISSIONS DIDN'T GO ACCORDING TO REHEARSALS 
THE ACTOR PUNCHED ME ON THE JAW 
WE REHEARSED WE CAME IN EARLY EVERY MORNING 
UNFORTUNATELY ON THE LIVE BROADCAST 
BECAUSE HE WAS NERVOUS HE CAUGHT ME FLUSH ON THE JAW 
I DON'T THINK HEY 
I LANDED ON THE DECK 
NOW THEN YOU LISTEN SHUT UP 
I WAS SO LIVID WE HAD A BIT OF A SET TO 
AS ACTORS GOT USED TO THE MEDIUM 
THEY STARTED TO APPRECIATE WHAT THE LIVE STUDIO HAD TO OFFER 
AND ADOPTED A MORE INTIMATE STYLE 
WHEN I'M HERE IT'S TO SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE 
BUT ON TELEVISION YOU'VE GOT TO CONSCIOUSLY PLAY 
TO THOSE TWO OR THREE PEOPLE IN THE LIVING ROOM 
SO YOU'VE GOT TO SCALE IT DOWN 
YOU'VE GOT TO IGNORE THAT DREADFUL UNFORGIVING 
BEADY EYE THAT REALLY 
IT STRIPS YOU AWAY 
IF YOU'RE INSINCERE YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO PLAY FOR REAL 
IN FAIRNESS TO ME THEY SAY I'M GOING AROUND WITH ANOTHER WOMAN GRACE 
YOU NEVER ACHIEVE THE PERFECT PERFORMANCE BUT ON OCCASIONS YOU GET NEAR AND WITH LIVE BROADCASTS 
YOU SENSED SOMEHOW YOU SENSED EVEN THOUGH YOU WEREN'T CERTAIN 
BUT YOU KNEW WHEN YOU WERE GIVING A GOOD PERFORMANCE 
THE SNAG WAS YOU NEVER SAW THE RESULT 
OH WHY BRING THAT UP 
YOU OFFERED TO PAY FOR IT SPORT 
I WANT ME HEAD EXAMINED WE HAD THE CAR IT'S FAIR THANK YOU 
MY ABIDING MEMORY OF TELEVISION APART FROM THE HEAT AND THE DUST AND THE NOISE 
WAS THAT WONDERFUL CHALLENGING MOMENT 
WHEN THAT RED LIGHT USED TO GO ON AND YOU WERE CUED 
AND YOU KNEW THAT THERE WERE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WATCHING YOU 
AND 
IT WAS THAT GAMBLER'S THROW YOU WERE EITHER VERY GOOD OR VERY BAD 
NEXT WEEK WE'LL BE BACK IN THE GREEN AS USUAL SEE YOU THEN GOOD NIGHT 
ESTABLISHED B. B. C. DRAMAS LIKE DIXON OF DOCK GREEN 
WERE CHALLENGED FROM NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE 
WHEN RIVAL I. T. V. CAME ON THE AIR 
AND NOW FOR YOUR SUNDAY NIGHT DRAMATIC ENTERTAINMENT WE BRING YOU ARMCHAIR THEATRE 
IN DIRECT COMPETITION TO THE B. B. C.'S SUNDAY NIGHT DRAMA SLOT 
I. T. V.'S POWERFUL SERIES ARMCHAIR THEATRE ALSO WENT OUT LIVE 
BUT CAPITALISED ON VIEWERS' GROWING TASTE FOR EVERYDAY REALISM 
OH THIS IS VAL YOU STOPPING HERE THEN LOVE 
THAT'S RIGHT WHICH ROOM THE DOOR'S LOCKED SHE'S A STUDENT 
I'M A STUDENT MYSELF 
OF FORM 
GOT ANY FAGS 
THAT SUDDENLY THEY STOPPED DOING THESE RATHER 
AND THEY STARTED TO REFLECT THE REAL WORLD BACK TO THEIR AUDIENCE 
WHAT ABOUT YOU THE BINGO HERE YOU ARE THEN 
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR CLASS HEY HEADS OR TAILS HEADS HARD LUCK 
THANKS LOVELY GET OFF YOU APE IT'S YOU IS IT DO YOU KNOW HIM 
KNOW HIM WHO DOESN'T WHO HASN'T BEEN DONE BY HIM I WOULDN'T HAVE HIM ON ME CONSCIENCE 
I THINK THAT WAS WHEN TELEVISION REALLY BEGAN TO BE AN ART FORM IN ITS OWN RIGHT 
THE DRAMA COALESCED AND CAME TOGETHER WITH ARMCHAIR THEATRE AND 
FROM THEN ON GOOD WRITERS CAME TO TELEVISION 
AND WROTE PLAYS FOR THIS MEDIUM 
AND GOOD ACTORS THOUGHT THIS IS BETTER WE WANT TO BE A PART OF IT 
ONE B. B. C. RESPONSE TO THE REALISM OF ARMCHAIR THEATRE 
WAS A NEW LIVE HARD HITTING POLICE SERIES 
Z. CARS STARTED IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO 
AND RAN FOR SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN EPISODES 
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO JOIN HIM ANYTHING TO GET OUT OF THIS RAIN 
Z. CARS HAD MUCH MORE 
OF A DOCUMENTARY FEEL ABOUT IT 
I THINK IT LOST THAT HOMELY FEEL DIXON OF DOCK GREEN HAD 
THEY USED FILMED INSERTS AND SHOWED THE COPPERS 
GOING INTO LIVERPOOL HOUSING ESTATES AND THE REAL WORLD 
IT WASN'T SORT OF COMFORTABLE VILLAGE LIFE THAT DIXON PORTRAYED 
Z. CARS USED AN UNPRECEDENTED REALISTIC DOCUMENTARY STYLE OF FILMING 
RECORDING GENUINE LOCATION SOUND TO INTEGRATE WITH STUDIO ACTION 
IT WAS A LIVE SHOW 
FORTY FIVE MINUTES WAS LIVE AND FIVE MINUTES WAS FILMED 
YOU FILMED AHEAD OF TIME BUT FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES YOU WERE LIVE 
AND HAD AN AUDIENCE OF EIGHTEEN MILLION 
BIGGER THAN CORONATION STREET OR EASTENDERS MASSIVE AUDIENCES 
THAT CLOCK BEATS 
ON A LIVE SHOW STRATFORD JOHNS WOULD VOMIT FOR TWO HOURS 
I MEAN FRANK WINDSOR WENT INTO A NERVOUS PAROXYSM 
JOCK THANK GOD IT WASN'T IN COLOUR WOULD GO RED LIKE A TOMATO 
CUT 
WHEN THAT RED LIGHT WENT ON YOUR GUTS WENT INTO YOUR HEART 
STAND BY WE'RE GOING FIRST TO TELE CINE FOR THE TITLES 
AND THEN STRAIGHT INTO YOU BRIAN 
OH CHRIST 
HOW D'YOU MEAN HOW MUCH WELL IF YOU FANCY THEM NAH NOT MY CASH 
THEY'LL LOSE IT HOW MUCH THEN FIVE BOB WHAT ODDS ARE YOU GIVING 
ODDS YOU'RE THE ONE FANCIES THEM 
GOING OUT LIVE REALLY ADDED JUST MADE IT COMPLETELY REAL 
BUT THE B. B. C. THOUGHT THEY'D LIKE TO TRY ONE WHERE WE RECORDED IT 
AND WE DRIED 
WE DRIED IT WAS DEAD IT WAS USELESS SO THEY ABANDONED IT 
THREE WEEKS LATER THEY FITTED IT IN AND WE DID IT LIVE AND IT WAS MARVELLOUS 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR GO TO THE FIRE AT TWENTY KINGSWOOD AVENUE ASSIST 
THAT'S ONE THING I NEVER RECKONED 
THE USE OF CARS IN THE STUDIO 
AND TO A GREAT EXTENT 
THE PERSONALITIES INVOLVED AND THE SCRIPT WRITERS 
CREATED A FEELING OF MOVING FORWARD 
I THINK THE DIRECTORS AND THE B. B. C. 
REALISED THEY'D GOT SOMETHING ORIGINAL 
AND THEY REALISED THAT THE SKY WAS THE LIMIT 
AND SO WE ACTUALLY 
BROKE THE BOUNDARIES OF STUDIOS 
IT WAS THE MOST TECHNICALLY ADVANCED PRODUCTION SO FAR 
BROADCASTING EVERY WEEK LIVE FROM FIFTEEN SETS IN THE STUDIO USING FIVE SEPARATE CAMERAS 
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOTHING THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO ASK 
LEAVE HER ALONE THIS IS MY HOUSE AND MY DAUGHTER AND I'M TALKING 
DON'T KNOCK HER NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU JUST A MINUTE 
I SAID YOU COULD COME IN AYE WELL NOW GET OUT 
Z. CARS ALSO REFINED THE ILLUSION OF BACK PROJECTION ON T. V. 
WHERE MOVING FILM WAS SHOWN BEHIND A STATIC CAR IN THE STUDIO 
IT MEANT ACTORS HAD TO SYNCHRONISE THEIR DRIVING WITH THE FILM 
SLIDE PROJECTIONS THERE AND THERE AND BACK PROJECTION BEHIND US 
SO YOU'D REVERSE THE CAR AND LOOK BEHIND AND YOU HAD TO TIME IT 
YOU HAD TO TIME IT IN THE STUDIO ON THE LIVE SHOWS TIME YOUR REVERSING 
YOU'D LOOK FOR A BIT AND THEN PUT IT IN REVERSE WHEN YOU SAW IT WAS GOING 
THE STUDIO CARS WERE ALSO MODIFIED TO HELP SHOOTING 
THEIR WINDSCREENS WERE REMOVED TO STOP CAMERA REFLECTIONS 
BUT THAT MEANT THE ACTORS COULD INADVERTENTLY DO THE IMPOSSIBLE 
ON THE LIVE SHOW 
HERE'S THE ZEPHYR AND OF COURSE MY HAT WAS THERE 
SO LIVE IN THE STUDIO WHICH GOT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PHONING THROUGH 
THERE WAS NO GLASS ON IT SO THE CAMERA COULD COME INTO YOUR FACE 
AND I FORGOT ON A LIVE SHOW AND PICKED IT UP AND PUT IT ON MY HEAD 
THEN THOUGHT OH GOD I PUT MY HAND THROUGH THE GLASS 
THERE WAS NO GLASS AND PEOPLE SAID HAS HE PUT HIS HAND THROUGH THE SCREEN AND PUT IT ON 
I DID THAT SEVERAL TIMES I ALSO DID IT WITH A RADIO 
I REACHED IN WHEN THE RADIO RANG 
AND GRABBED THE RADIO COS THERE WAS NO GLASS THERE AND PICKED IT UP 
YES ZEBRA TWENTY ONE TO B. D. 
AND I THOUGHT OH BLOODY HELL 
THIRTY TWO SECONDS 
IT WAS CRUCIAL TO KEEP TO TIME 
FORGETTING THE ODD LINE COULD BE A PROBLEM 
BUT FORGETTING A WHOLE SCENE WAS A LOT MORE SERIOUS 
ON ONE OCCASION I HAD TO ARREST JOHN HURT HE WAS PETRIFIED 
AS GUESTS WERE 
WE GOT USED TO IT AND AS I APPROACHED HIM 
I SAID COME ON COME ON I'LL HAVE A WORD WITH YOU 
AND HE SAID I'M GUILTY 
AND THAT WAS A TEN MINUTE SCENE GONE 
YOU'D BETTER COME WITH ME THEN I WALKED PAST THE CAMERA 
AND SAID CUE THE NEXT SCENE 
AND THE NEWS WENT OUT TEN MINUTES EARLY THAT NIGHT 
DURING THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES 
MANY NEW LIVE PRODUCTIONS EMERGED 
INCLUDING SOAPS LIKE COMPACT 
AND A STRING OF SINGLE DRAMAS 
THE DISCIPLINE OF DIRECTORS LIKE ALAN BRIDGES WAS NEEDED 
TO GET THE CAST AND CREW THROUGH THE RELENTLESS SCHEDULE 
LEADING UP TO EACH TRANSMISSION 
WE'D FIRST MEET THE CAST AFTER FOUR TO FIVE WEEKS PREPARATION 
AND DESIGNING SETS WITH A DESIGNER 
TALKING ABOUT THE LIGHTING WITH THE LIGHTING ARTIST 
AND EVEN SOUND 
CUE FACTORY NOISE 
WE'D MEET THE CAST AND HAVE ABOUT THREE WEEKS OF REHEARSAL 
IN A REHEARSAL ROOM 
USUALLY AN OLD ARMY TERRITORIAL DRILL HALL 
WOULD IT BE GOOD IF SHE GAVE ME THE HAMMER YOU WON'T TOUCH IT 
HAVE YOU GOT A JOB OR AIN'T YOU DO IT THEN 
THEN WE'D COME INTO THE STUDIO AND WE WOULD REHEARSE IT ON THE FLOOR 
I THINK WE'D HAVE FOR A BIG TWO HOUR LIVE SHOW 
WE HAD THREE DAYS ON THE FLOOR 
ALL RIGHT FROM THE SAME PLACE 
I'VE DONE ALL THE THINKING AND I'VE DECIDED FOR YOU 
YOU'VE THROWN YOUR HAND IN 
WHEN YOU'RE RETIRED I'LL HAVE THE WEIGHT OF THIS PLACE ON MY SHOULDERS 
RATHER GOOD ACTUALLY 
AND THEN WE WENT OUT LIVE OVER TWO HOURS LATE IN THE EVENING 
AND IT WAS VERY EXCITING AND VERY WEARING 
FIVE FOUR THREE 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SWAP OVER FOR A BIT YOU WON'T TOUCH IT 
YOU CAN KEEP YOUR RUDDY 
SO THE LIGHT HAS GONE OFF AT THE END OF THE CREDITS 
AND I THOUGHT I'D LOVE TO DO THAT AGAIN I DID THAT BADLY 
VIDEO TAPE RECORDING HAD BEEN AVAILABLE SINCE THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
BUT HAD HARDLY BEEN USED IN DRAMA 
WHILE SOME DIRECTORS FELT THAT IT COULD GIVE THEM MORE CONTROL 
THERE WAS UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW IT WOULD AFFECT THE CAST'S PERFORMANCE 
I THINK THE ACTORS 
WERE QUITE RELUCTANT TO LOSE THE LIVE FACILITY 
BECAUSE YOU'D THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE ORDEAL 
AND THE NERVES WOULD BE PROHIBITIVE 
AND THERE WERE TOO MANY VARIABLES BUT A LOT OF THE ACTORS I SPOKE TO 
FOUND THAT WHEN THE PERFORMANCE WAS LIVE THEY RETAINED CONTROL OF IT 
MARY WHAT IS IT 
I'M LEAVING YOU 
YOU'RE MORE IN CONTROL OF YOUR PERFORMANCE WHEN IT'S LIVE 
THAT WONDERFUL PAUSE YOU USED TO GET THAT DANGEROUS PAUSE 
WHEN I COME OFF DUTY TOMORROW I'LL LOOK FOR FRESH DIGS NO ANDY TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG THEN 
IF YOU'RE UNDER RUNNING THESE DAYS THEY CAN TWEAK OUT LITTLE BITS 
WHEN YOU SEE IT YOU THINK THAT WASN'T AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WAS 
IN FACT YOU'VE TAKEN OUT MILLISECONDS' 
YOU'RE IN THE HANDS OF THE EDITOR RATHER LIKE IN MOVIES 
IT CAN TOTALLY CHANGE YOUR PERFORMANCE 
OH ANDY I DO LOVE YOU 
YOU MUST BELIEVE THAT 
OF COURSE I DO 
I FEEL THE SAME WAY TOO 
BY THE MID SIXTIES AS VIDEO RECORDING BECAME ROUTINE ELSEWHERE 
THERE WERE DOUBTS WHETHER STAYING LIVE GAVE THE VIEWER THE BEST DRAMA 
IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THOSE LIVE DRAMAS THEY SEEM A BIT LIMITED 
AND AWKWARD IN TERMS OF HOW THEY GET FROM ONE SCENE TO ANOTHER 
AND THE PACE OF THEM 
IS SLOWER THAN IT IS TODAY 
SOMETIMES THAT SLOW PACE REALLY WORKS WELL 
AND ALLOWS YOU TO GET UNDER THE SKIN OF THE CHARACTERS BUT THE SLOW PACE IS BECAUSE WE'RE CUTTING CLUMSILY 
FROM ONE LIVE SET TO ANOTHER LIVE SET IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS IT COULD BE 
TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS AVAILABLE MEANT THAT YOU COULD SWITCH LOCATIONS 
YOU COULD FILM IN A STUDIO OR OUTSIDE 
THERE WERE FAR MORE BROAD POSSIBILITIES OPENING UP 
THE CONFUSINGLY CALLED WEDNESDAY PLAYS 
WERE IN FACT NOW ONLY DISTANTLY RELATED TO STAGE DRAMA 
GRITTY STORIES LIKE CATHY COME HOME 
WERE TOTALLY RECORDED AND EDITED ON FILM 
AND GAVE VIEWERS A TASTE FOR CINEMATIC PACE AND REALISM 
EVENING ALL 
BY THE SEVENTIES MOST DRAMAS 
INCLUDING DIXON OF DOCK GREEN AND Z. CARS WERE RECORDED 
CAN YOU SMELL GAS OUT THERE I CAN SMELL IT IN HERE 
IT LOOKED LIKE LIVE DRAMA HAD DIED 
BUT IN THE EIGHTIES 
THERE WAS A BRAVE REVIVAL 
NOW THE OPENING PLAY IN A NEW SERIES DIRECT FROM PEBBLE MILL IN BIRMINGHAM 
IN A BOLD EXPERIMENT B. B. C. TWO'S SERIES OF ONE HOUR LIVE BROADCASTS 
SIGNIFICANTLY STARTED WITH A VERY THEATRICAL STAGING THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO 
EVERYTHING IN THE STUDIO WAS LIVE EXCEPT THE HORSES 
I WARNED YOU ABOUT THIS IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY IT'S HIM TOO 
WE COULDN'T STOP HER BUT 
COME ON AFRAID ARE YOU 
YOU'LL NEVER BREAK US 
WE CAN'T BE BROKEN 
WE'RE A BLOODY COLOUR COMPANY 
THE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE SERIES OF LIVE DRAMAS ALSO INCLUDED A MEDICAL FARCE 
FEATURING A YOUNG LESLIE PHILLIPS 
WHERE DID YOU GET MONEY FOR THIS UNNECESSARY COSMETIC SURGERY 
I TOOK OUT A SECOND MORTGAGE ON THE HOUSE 
MY HOUSE 
OUR HOUSE 
HOW DARE YOU AFTER ALL YOU SAID 
AFTER ALL I SUFFERED 
IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT PIECE OF MEDICAL DRAMA THAT HERALDED A RESURGENCE OF INTEREST IN GOING LIVE 
FOURTEEN YEARS LATER 
IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AMERICA WAS HOOKED BY A LIVE EPISODE OF ER 
THE TREND WAS SET FOR REVITALISING LONG RUNNING SERIES WITH SPECIAL LIVE EDITIONS 
OVER HERE IN TWO THOUSAND WE GAVE THE HONOUR TO A PIECE OF PURE SOAP 
IT WAS THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY 
OF CORONATION STREET SO THAT WAS BROADCAST LIVE I BELIEVE ONE OR TWO OF THE EARLY EPISODES WENT OUT LIVE 
SO THEY RETURNED TO THEIR ROOTS IN THAT SENSE 
WHAT'S ALL THIS A DEMONSTRATION 
RESIDENTS ARE TRYING TO STOP THE COUNCIL TARRING OVER THE COBBLES 
THIS DEMONSTRATION WOULDN'T BE LED BY AN AGEING LEFT WING FIREBRAND CALLED KEN BARLOW WOULD IT 
HE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH IT YEAH 
PRINCE CHARLES MADE A CAMEO APPEARANCE ON IT 
OH LOOK 
IT'S AUDREY ON THE NEWS 
WE'LL NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF THIS 
SHE LOOKS LOVELY I BET SHE LOVED IT 
WHAT'S SHE SAYING TO HIM WHAT'S SHE GIVING HIM 
IT WAS PROBABLY A GIMMICK WITH A USEFUL SIDE EFFECT 
IN TERMS OF RATINGS IF YOU ANNOUNCE THAT THIS IS GOING OUT LIVE 
YOU MIGHT ATTRACT EXTRA VIEWERS 
THE KNOCK ON EFFECTS FOR THE ACTORS IS THAT IT DOES CRISP THEM UP 
I'VE LIVED HERE ALL MY LIFE I'VE SEEN PEOPLE COME AND GO 
A LOT OF CHANGES A LOT OF DRAMAS IN THE STREET 
LIKE OTHER STREETS WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET TOGETHER 
BUT I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS ONE 
THE LATEST LONG RUNNING SERIES TO GO OUT LIVE WAS THE MOST DARING YET 
IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THE BILL WAS CELEBRATING TWENTY YEARS ON AIR 
THE DECISION TO GO LIVE WAS DESIGNED TO BOOST BOTH RATINGS 
AND THE MORALE OF THE CAST AND CREW 
THERE WAS A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE PERFORMANCES IN THE LIVE EPISODE 
COMPARED TO A RECORDED EPISODE 
THE EXTRA PRESSURE OF HAVING TO GET IT RIGHT THE ADRENALIN WAS HIGH 
THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCES IN SOME CASES ACTUALLY BENEFITED FROM THAT 
I THINK IT GAVE THE SHOW A CERTAIN IMPETUS AND DRIVE 
THAT MADE IT EXCITING TO WATCH AS WELL 
WHAT'S HIS NAME MARK 
HE WON'T LISTEN WHERE IN THE VAN 
THE MIDDLE HE CAN'T GET OUT BUT HE WON'T LET HER OUT HIS HISTORY 
HE WAS DRUNK SMASHING UP A PHONE BOX I DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD A KNIFE 
WHAT WE NEED IS CALM AND FOCUS YEAH SORRY 
THIS WAS SO AMBITIOUS 
AND YOU KNEW YOU COULDN'T DO IT AGAIN 
SO IF IT DID GO WRONG THAT WAS IT 
IT WAS A SORT OF STRESS 
BUT ACTUALLY HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN SAY THEY'LL TURN UP AT WORK 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON TENTERHOOKS 
IN FRONT OF THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE THAT'S GOT TO BE A BUZZ 
YOU LEFT ME FOR AN UNSTABLE MIDDLE AGED WOMAN 
WHO IS DRINKING HERSELF TO DEATH 
IT WAS EXTREMELY HIGH PRESSURED 
IT WASN'T JUST FOR THE ACTORS FOR LINES 
WHICH WAS HARD ENOUGH BUT IT WAS ALL THE TECHNICAL STUFF 
WHICH WAS SO COMPLICATED I THINK WE HAD SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY TWO CAMERAMEN 
THIRTY MILES OF CABLE OR WHATEVER AND ACTUALLY 
THE LOGISTICS OF MOVING AROUND THIS BUILDING AND GETTING ONE THING FOLLOWING ANOTHER WAS VERY HARD 
GARY I'M AFRAID WE'VE HAD SOME NEWS AND IT'S NOT GOOD 
THE LIVE EPISODE WAS ABOUT DOUBLE THE COST OF A NORMAL BILL EPISODE 
SO UM 
IT'S DEBATEABLE 
WHETHER IT WAS VALUE FOR MONEY 
I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE WE'LL DO IT YOUR WAY NOW 
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE DID IT LIVE 
WAS BECAUSE THAT DOES GENERATE A LOT OF PUBLICITY 
I THINK THE OTHER REASON IS TO PROVE THAT YOU CAN DO IT 
THE LIVE BILL WAS A HIT WITH ACTORS AND VIEWERS 
BUT IT WAS ANOTHER BILL WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE WHO BROUGHT THE STORY OF LIVE DRAMA FULL CIRCLE 
THE BROADCAST ALSO IN TWO THOUSAND THREE OF SHAKESPEARE'S RICHARD THE SECOND 
RETURNED LIVE T. V. DRAMA TO ITS CLASSIC THEATRE BEGINNINGS 
BUT WITH A NOD TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
MAY I ASK YOU PLEASE TO DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOU'VE SWITCHED OFF ALL WATCH ALARMS PAGERS AND MOBILE PHONES 
NO POST DESPATCH FOR IRELAND 
GENTLEMEN WILL YOU GO MUSTER MEN 
I THOUGHT THAT THE RICHARD THE SECOND THAT WE DID 
LIVE FROM THE GLOBE WAS AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC PIECE OF THEATRE 
AND IT WAS A FANTASTIC PIECE OF THEATRE BOTH IN THE SENSE 
THAT WE SAW THE GLOBE DOING THEIR RICHARD THE SECOND AND A FANTASTIC PIECE OF THEATRE FOR B. B. C. FOUR 
IN GOD'S NAME AND THE KING'S SAY WHO THOU ART 
AND WHY THOU COMEST KNIGHTLY CLAD IN ARMS AGAINST WHAT MAN THOU COMEST 
AND WHAT THY QUARREL SPEAK TRULY ON THY KNIGHTHOOD AND THY OATH 
AS SHALL DEFEND THEE 
IT FELT LIKE A REAL EVENT 
IT FELT LIKE YOU WERE GENUINELY ATTENDING THE GLOBE LIKE THE AUDIENCE 
WITH RECENT LIVE DRAMA CAPITALISING SO SUCCESSFULLY ON ITS THEATRICAL ROOTS 
WHAT'S NEXT 
AUDIENCES LIKE TO HAVE SOME INPUT NOW AS WE SEE WITH BIG BROTHER 
CELEBRITY GET ME OUT OF HERE SCENARIOS THEY LIKE INPUT ON WHAT'S HAPPENING 
AND I THINK THERE IS A WAY OF PRESENTING DRAMA 
WHERE THEY CAN HAVE MORE SAY IN THE OUTCOME 
SO ONE FUTURE MIGHT BE INTERACTIVE DRAMA 
WHERE VIEWERS CONTROL THE PLOT LINES 
HEY CUT IT OUT BUT WILL T. V. CHANNELS STILL COMMISSION PURE LIVE DRAMA 
IF SOMEONE CAME TO ME WITH A PROPOSAL FOR A LIVE DRAMA 
I WOULD ASK WHY WE'RE DOING IT LIVE AND IF I FELT THAT THE REASONS AS TO WHY WE'RE DOING IT LIVE 
IS THAT IT WOULD BE REALLY EXCITING FOR EVERYONE WHO WAS MAKING IT 
THEN I WOULD ASK THEM TO LOOK AT THAT PROPOSAL AGAIN THE LIVENESS HAS TO BE EXCITING FOR THE AUDIENCE FIRST 
AND THEN IT CAN BE EXCITING FOR ALL THE PEOPLE MAKING IT 
IF LIVE T. V. DRAMA WILL NOW ALWAYS BE THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE 
ITS LONG HISTORY SHOULD AT LEAST REMIND US HOW MUCH T. V. STILL OWES TO ITS EARLY PIONEERS 
WHO HAD TO INVENT THE MEDIUM FROM SCRATCH 
CUE ROLLER ON SIX 
EXCELLENT
