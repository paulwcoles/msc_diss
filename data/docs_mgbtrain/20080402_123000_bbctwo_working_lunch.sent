GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO WORKING 
LUNCH ANOTHER BLOW IF YOU WANT A 
MORTGAGE FIRST DIRECT HALTS ITS 
NEW OFFERS TO NEW CUSTOMERS IS 
THERE ANY HOPE OF BRINGING YOUR 
PAYMENTS BACK DOWN TO EARTH AS THE 
COSTS OF GETTING A HOME LOAN ROCKET 
PICK AND MIX PROFITS FROM 
WOOLWORTHS ARE THEY UP DOWN A 
BIT OF BOTH ARE ARE THEY MADE OF 
LIQUORICE A COOL RESPONSE AS MORE 
OF YOU VOICE CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR 
SAVINGS IN ICELANDIC BANKS AND HOW 
DO YOU MAKE MONEY RUNNING A 
SEASONAL BUSINESS ON A ROCK IN THE 
ATLANTIC I AM ON THE ISLES OF 
SCILLY FINDING OUT WHEN IS 
POPULARITY NOT A GOOD THING WHEN 
YOU ARE A BANK SO OVERWHELMED BY 
MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS THAT YOU 
HAVE TO SHUT YOUR DOORS TO NEW 
CUSTOMERS THE INTERNET BANK FIRST 
DIRECT IS IN THAT POSITION EXACTLY 
UNTIL YESTERDAY FIRST DIRECT THE 
INTERNET BANK HAD BEEN OFFERING A 
MORTGAGE RATE OF FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE PER CENT FIX FOR TWO 
YEARS A YEAR AGO THAT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT 
BUT TODAY IT HAS BEEN HUGELY 
POPULAR TOO POPULAR IN FACT SO 
THEY PULLED IT 
THE MAIN REASON IS OUR DEMAND HAS 
BEEN EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT FIVE 
TIMES THE NORMAL LEVEL AND THAT 
PUTS A BIT OF STRESS OP OUR ABILITY 
TO GIVE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WHICH 
WE ARE FAMOUS FOR AND THEREFORE WE 
JUST WANT TO TAKE A PAUSE FOR 
BREATH FOCUS ON OUR EXISTING 
CUSTOMERS MAKE SURE WE SERVE THEM 
WELL AND GET THEM WHAT WE NEED AND 
WE WILL BE BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
THE SERVE NEW CUSTOMERS FIRST FIRST DIRECT INSISTS IT IS A SEM PRI 
TEMPORARY MEASURE AND THERE IS NO 
SUGGESTION THE BANK IS EXPERIENCING 
FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES HOWEVER IT 
IS ANOTHER TURN OF THE MORTGAGE 
SCREW RECENTLY LIFE HAS BECOME 
FAR TOUGHER FOR THOSE LOOKING TO 
REMORTGAGE OR INDEED GET ON THE THE 
HOUSING LADDER FOR THE FIRST TIME 
ALL LENDERS HAVE STOPPED OFFERING 
MORTGAGES OF OVER ONE HUNDRED PER CENT NORTHERN 
ROCK HAS COME OUT OF THE NEW 
MORTGAGE MARKET AND ANNOUNCED IT 
WANTS TO GET RID OF SIXTY PER CENT OF EXISTING 
CUSTOMERS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEAR 
NATIONWIDE HBOS AND LLOYD'S 
INCREASING THEIR RATES DESPITE NO 
CHANGES FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
AND SOME SMALLER BUILDING SOCIETIES 
HAVE SAID THEY WILL ONLY LEND TO 
THOSE IN THEIR IMMEDIATE LOCAL AREA 
MANY FEEL IT WILL CONTINUE TO GET 
WORSE BR IT GETS ANY BETTER 
BEFORE YOU TOUCHED ON NIT THE FILM 
THERE BUT IN CASE PEOPLE MISSED IT 
IS THERE ANY REASON WHY WE SHOULD 
BE WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS 
PARTICULAR INTERNET BANK 
NO THAT 
IS A SIMPLE ANSWER NO THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE WAS MAKING IT VERY CLEAR 
THIS MORNING AS YOU HEARD IN THAT 
CLIP THAT IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF 
ANY LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS ON THEIR 
PART IT IS NOT ANOTHER NORTHERN 
ROCK LET US PUT IT SIMPLY IN CASE 
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED IT IS THEY HAVE 
BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH THIS DEMAND 
THEY HAVE A GOOD REPUTATION FOR 
CUSTOMER SERVICE AND A LOT OF 
CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING 
THEY COULDN'T GET THROUGH ON THE 
PHONE AND CLEARLY THEY DIDN'T 
LIKE THAT FIRST DIRECT DIDN'T LIKE 
THAT THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS 
RIGHT SO THEY WITHDRAWN THEY SAY 
IT IS TEMPORARY THEY WON'T BE 
DRAWN ON HOW TEMPORARY TEMPORARY 
IT IS BUT THEY SEEM TO BE TALKING 
ABOUT WEEKS RATHER THAN MONTHS SO 
WE SHOULDN'T BE WORRIED ABOUT THE 
BANK ITSELF BUT I THINK THERE IS 
STILL CONCERN OUT THERE ABOUT THIS 
DOMINO EFFECT AS I SAID IN THE 
FILM THE MARKET IS REALLY 
CONTRACTING AND TO PUT IT INTO 
PERSPECTIVE OF HOW MUCH IT IS 
CONTRACTING WE ASK MONEY FACT HOW 
MANY THERE WERE OUT THERE IN TERMS 
OF MORTGAGE PRODUCTS AND IT IS 
DRAMATIC LOOK AT THIS JULY LAST 
YEAR THERE WERE OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
MORTGAGE PRODUCTS OUT THERE WHICH 
SOUNDS LIKE MORE THAN ONE WOULD 
NEED IN A MARKET PLACE NECESSARILY 
BUT NOW THAT HAS CONTRACTED TO JUST 
FIVE SEVEN HUNDRED SO IT HAS DECREASED BY TWO 
THIRDS I THEN ASKED THEM TO GO 
BACK EVEN FURTHER BECAUSE I WANTED 
TO PUT IT IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 
IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE THERE WERE ONLY FOUR HUNDRED ELEVEN IN THE 
LATE NINETIES THERE WAS A HUGE EXPLOSION 
AND NOW THAT IS COMING BACK DOWN 
AGAIN BUT I ASKED THE DOWN SL 
COUNCIL OF MORTGAGE LENDERS I SAID 
SINCE FINANCIAL DEREGULATION HAVE 
WE SEEN TURBULENT TIMES LIKE THIS 
BEFORE 
I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE BEFORE BEEN HERE BEFORE FOR THE LAST 
COUPLE OF DECADES IN THAT WHAT WE 
ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS VERY MUCH 
A SUPPLY LED PROBLEM WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IS WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 
FUNDING IN THE MARKET TO SUPPORT 
THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER DEMAND THAT 
WE ARE SEEING FOR MORTGAGES THAT 
IS NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN USED 
TO IN THE PAST WHERE WE HAVE HAD 
MORTGAGE MARKET PROBLEMS THEY HAVE 
TENDED TO BE BECAUSE CONSUMER 
DEMAND HAS DROPPED OFF SO IT IS 
NOT SINCE AT LEAST A COUPLE OF 
DECADES AGO THAT WE HAVE REALLY 
SEEN THIS KIND OF CONSTRAINT ON 
FUNDING ON THE SUPPLY OF MORTGAGES 
CONTINUING FOR SUCH A PROTRACTED 
PERIOD AND WITHOUT ANY END DATE IN 
SIGHT 
YESTERDAY WE TALKED ABOUT SIGHT THE HOUSE PRICES COMING DOWN WHICH 
IS GREAT IF YOU A FIRST TIME BUYER 
BUT IF YOU CAN'T GET A MORTGAGE IT 
IS NOT GREAT NEWS SO IF YOU ARE 
REMORTGAGING OR A FIRST TIME BUYER 
WHAT POSITION ARE YOU IN 
YOU ARE 
IN A BAD POSITION YOU ARE NOT IN 
AS GOOD A POSITION AS A YEAR AGO 
BUT WE RANG ROUND A FEW AND TRIED 
TO CONSOLIDATE ADVICE AND THERE 
WERE THREE THING THE FIRST ONE WAS 
THAT REALLY IT IS WORTH 
CONSIDERING ACTING FAST GET YOUR 
DOCUMENTATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
BECAUSE AS WE CAN SEE THINGS JUST 
DISAPPEAR FROM THE MARKET FROM ONE 
DAY TO THE NEXT PEOPLE SOME WERE 
EXPECTING THIS OTHERS WEREN'T ON 
THE FIRST DIRECT SO ACT AS FAR AS 
FAST AS YOU CAN THE SECOND THING 
IS CONSIDER THE FULL COST OF THE 
MORTGAGE SO LOOK AT THE ARRANGEMENT 
FEE IS THERE A PENALTY DON'T BE 
SEDUCED BY THE INTEREST RATE DON'T 
BE PUT OFF BY THE INTEREST RATE 
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE PUT THEIR 
INTEREST RATE UP BUT THE FEES ARE 
LOW COMPARED TO OTHERS SO TAKE THAT 
VIEW COMPARE IT ALL AND THE LAST 
THING IS AND THIS IS A MORE 
GENERAL POINT BUT PLEASE PLEASE 
PLEASE DON'T FALL BEHIND WITH 
PAYMENTS DON'T MISS A CREDIT CARD 
PAYMENT BECAUSE YOU ARE DEAD IN THE 
WATER IF THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU 
GO TO YOUR PARENT AND SAY LEND ME 
SOME MONEY FOR THAT PAYMENT DO IT 
NOW BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES ARE 
REALLY OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE 
ACTUAL FACT ITSELF 
BRIEFLY FINALLY 
STANDARD VARIABLE WHAT DO WE DO 
STANDARD VARIABLE HAS BEEN A NO NO 
IT IS NOT ADDS MUCH AS A NO NO 
BECAUSE THE MARGINS HAVE CHANGED 
BETWEEN STANDARD VARIABLE AND SOME 
OF THE FIXED RATES OUT THERE BUT 
STILL BE CAREFUL BECAUSE A STANDARD 
VARIABLE RATE IS MANAGED RATE SO 
IT IS UP TO THE BANK TO CHANGE THAT 
GIVEN HOW TOUGH THINGS ARE AT THE 
MOMENT THEY MAY WELL BE PUTTING 
THOSE UP WHEN BASE RATES ARE ON THE 
WHOLE ON THE WAY DOWN SO IT NOT 
NO NO BUT CONSIDER IT VERY 
CAREFULLY IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR IT 
TIME TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE REST OF 
THE BUSINESS NEWS AND THE EUROPEAN 
COMMISSION HAS LAUNCH AND IN DEPTH 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE GOVERNMENT'S 
BAIL OUT PLAN FOR NORTHERN ROCK IN 
FEBRUARY THE GOVERNMENT SAID THE 
BANK WOULD BE TEMPORARILY 
NATIONALISED BUT IT NEEDS EUROPEAN 
REGULATORS TO APPROVE THE RESCUE 
PLAN SO FAR FIFTY FIVE BILLION OF 
TAXPAYERS' MONEY HAS BEEN USED TO 
PROP UP THE BANK NATIONAL SAVINGS 
AND INVESTMENT IS CUTTING THE 
INTEREST RATE FOR THE SECOND TIME 
THIS YEAR THIS TIME RATES WILL BE 
CUT BY UP TO ELEVEN IS PER CENT AND THE CHANGE 
WILL AFFECT NEW INVESTMENT IN FIX 
INTEREST SAVINGS CERTIFICATE INDEX 
LINK CERTIFICATES CHILDREN'S BONUS 
BOND AND GUARANTEED GROWTH BONDS 
THEY SAY IT IS BECAUSE OF THE 
RETURN ON NOMINAL GUILTS HAVE 
FALLING SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE 
YEAR GILTS GRANDPARENT SEND SEVENTEEN 
HOURS A MONTH LOOKING OF THEIR 
GRAND CHILDREN ACCUSE CORING TO 
SAGA SIX OUT OF TEN SAID THEY 
LOOKED AFTER THEM REGULARLY WITH 
FIFTEEN PER CENT TAKING CARE OF THEM FOR MORE 
THAN FORTY HOURS A MONTH THE MAJORITY 
OFFER THEIR SERVICES ALL FOR FREE 
WITH JUST ONE PER CENT OF THOSE QUESTIONED 
RECEIVING MONEY FOR SERVICES 
ALTHOUGH SOME SAID THEY RECEIVED 
PAYMENT IN KIND SUCH AS HELP ROUND 
THE HOUSE WOOLWORTHS RESULTS ARE 
OUT NOW THEY TALKED OF CHALLENGING 
TIMES YET THEY REPORT ADD HUGE RISE 
IN PROFITS ALTHOUGH IN THE STYLE 
OF THEIR MOST FAMOUS PRODUCT IT WAS 
A SORT OF PICK AND MIX SET OF 
FIGURES 
THE HEADLINE PROFITS WERE DOWN 
DOWN TWENTY SIX PER CENT THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF 
THE HUGE COST INVOLVED IN DEALLING 
WHAT WITH A NUMBER OF THING THE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION INQUIRY INTO 
THEIR PURCHASE OF BERTRAM AND THE 
COST OF INTEGRATING A NUMBER OF 
OTHER BUSINESSES THEY BROUGHT AND 
TRYING TO BRING THEM INTO THE GROUP 
THAT COST THEM A LOT OF MONEY THAT 
KNOCKED THE HEADLINE PROFITS BUT 
IF WE VERY NICELY TURN TO TURNED 
A BLIND EYE TO THAT THEN WE COULD 
SAY THEY MADE A DECENT PROFIT THE 
UNDERLYING PROFIT OF THE ONGOING 
BUSINESS WAS UP VERY SUBSTANTIALLY 
THIRTY PER CENT HIGHER 
NOW ALTHOUGH WE KNOW WOOLWORTH 
WHEN I SAY THAT YOU ARE IMAGINING 
THIS THEIR SHOPS BUT THEY RUN 
SOME SIGNIFICANT BUSINESSES BEHIND 
THAT BRAND THAT WE DON'T SEE FOR 
INSTANCE THEY VA MASSIVE 
DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS CALLED 
ENTERTAINMENT U. K. WHICH DISTRIBUTES 
D. V. D. S. AND THE LIKES IT HAS A JOIN 
VENTURE WITH THE B. B. C. OR COMMERCIAL 
ARM OF THE THE B. B. C. TO PUBLISH 
VIDEOS IT HAS A BOOK AND A 
COMPUTER GAME WHOLESALER FOR SUCH 
A BIG NAME THE COMPANY MAKES A LOSS 
IN THE FIRST HALF AND ONLY USUALLY 
DRAGS ITSELF INTO PROFITS FOR A 
VERY BUSY WINTER AND CHRISTMAS 
THIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEIR 
SHARES OVER THE PAST YEAR THAT IS 
NOT GOOD LET US LOOK AT THE SECTOR 
THAT IS THE SHARES TODAY THEY ARE 
DOWN H. PER CENT THERE KINGFISHER FOUR PER CENT 
KINGFISHER THIS IS THE CHANGE OVER 
THE PAST MONTH THEIR GAIN AT THE 
TOP IS A CHAIN OF COMPUTER GAME 
SHOPS DEBENHAMS DOWN AND OVER THE 
MONTH THIS IS THE GOOD NEWS 
WOOLWORTHS SHARES ARE UP OVER THE 
MONTH L. AM JOINED NOW BY GREG 
HODGE FROM THE RETAIL ANALYSTS 
PLANET RETAIL WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 
THIS 
THIS 
IT HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING THIS MORNING WHEN WE DIGEST THE RESULT 
IT IS ONE OF DISAPPOINTMENT OUR 
GENERAL FEELINGS OF LIKE FOR LIKE 
SALES WERE DOWN AND THE OVERALL 
BOTTOM LINE SUFFERED A FORTY FOUR PER CENT DROP IN 
PROFIT 
YOU ARE A HARD MAN TO PLEASE PROFIT YOU ARE DISAPPOINTED AND THEIR 
PROFITS ARE UP ZERO PER CENT HOW DID THEY 
MANAGE THAT 
THEY HAVE GLOSSED OVER 
A FEW THINGS THERE AND THEY HAVE 
HAD A FEW CHARGES BUT THEY HAVE 
BUMPED UP THEIR PROFIT WITH 
PROPERTY DEALS THAT HAVE GONE ON 
WHAT DISAPPOINTS ME MOST IS PERHAPS 
THE POSITION AT THE HALF WAY STAGE 
AND WE REMEMBER LAST SUMMER AND HOW 
AWFUL IT WAS AND RETAILERS WERE 
BLAMING THE WEATHER WOOLWORTHS 
BEAT ANALYST EXPECTATION IN THE 
SUMMER LAST YEAR WITH SALES OF GAME 
D. V. D. AND INDOOR ITEMS SO WHEN WE 
CAME TO CHRISTMAS AND IT DECIDED 
NOT TO ADVERTISE SO MUCH ITS SALES 
HAVE COME DOWN 
IT IS A BIZARRE 
SITUATION A BRAND A MUCH LOVED 
BRAND LIKE WOOLWORTHS MAKES A LOSS 
FOR HALF OF THE YEAR SHA SURELY IS 
A BUSINESS IN A HUGE THAT IS A 
THAT SURELY IS A BUSINESS IN 
DIFFICULTY 
A LOT OF BUSINESS ARE DIFFICULTY RELIANT ON THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD 
MARKS AND AMP SPENCER DOESN'T MAKE LOSS 
IN THE FIRST HALF 
THEY ARE TWO 
DIFFERENT RETAILERS IN THE 
COMPOSITION OF THEIR PRODUCT 
OFFERING IS DIFFERENT THE PROBLEM 
WOOLWORTHS HAS IT IS A MID MARKET 
RETAILER OFFERING A MASS ASSORTMENT 
OF RANGES IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC 
ENVIRONMENT THAT IS NOT APPEALING 
TO THE CONSUMER THEY WANT SOMEBODY 
UNIQUE SOMETHING THAT IS DIFFERENT 
AWAY FROM THE NORM SO WHAT DO YOU 
THINK OF THE FUTURE GIVEN YOU DON'T 
RECKON MUCH OF ITS POSITION IN THE 
MARKET ITS FUTURE COULD BE 
INTERESTING AN INTERESTING PIECE 
OF NEWS THAT CAME OUT THIS MORNING 
WAS A POTENTIAL TIE UP WITH SOMMER 
FIELD THAT SEEMS BIZARRE IT IS 
ONE RETAILER THAT HAS PUT ITSELF UP 
FOR SALE AND ANOTHER IN DIFFICULT 
TIMES BUT IF YOU CAN GET A GOOD 
OFFERING YOU MAYBE NEVER KNOW 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
LET US MOVE ON ONE OF THE SECTORS 
WHICH HAS DONE WELL WAS THE BANKING 
SECTOR IT HELPED BOOST THE F. T. S. E. 
THERE IS SOME WEAKNESS DOWN HERE 
BUT SEEING GROWTH OF FOUR PER CENT IN THE 
SHARE PRICE 
SO NOT BAD AND THESE 
MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE F. T. S. E. ONE 
HUNDRED THAT HELPED THE F. T. S. E. TODAY 
HAVE A LOOK AT WHERE THAT AT THE 
MOMENT HERE IS A MORE WIDE LOOK 
HERE FAIRLY SPREAD I SUPPOSE MOST 
OF THEM ARE UP AND I THINK WE WILL 
SEE THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED UP TODAY SOME OF 
THE SMALLER COMPANIES HAVEN'T 
PERFORMED SO WELL TODAY I HAVE TO 
SAY ANY WAY THERE YOU CAN SEE 
HOPEFULLY YOUR FAVOURITE ONE OTHER 
ITEM OF NEWS IS FROM THE 
CONSTRUCTION SECTOR L. CONTRACTED 
GOT SMALLER IN MARCH THAT IS THE 
FIRST TIME IN SIX YEARS THAT HAS 
HAPPENED THAT IS ACCORDING TO 
SURVEY BY THE CHARTERS INSTITUTE OF 
PURCHASING AND SUPPLY THE 
SEASONALLY ADJUSTED INDEX FELL FROM 
FIFTY TWO POINT FOUR IN FEBRUARY IGNORE THAT THE 
CRUCIAL THING ABOUT THAT IS IT 
DIPPED BELOW THE FIFTY MARK THAT IS 
THE NO CHANGE LEVEL SO BELOW THAT 
IT MEANS THE INDUSTRY IS 
CONTRACTING THAT IS THE FIRST TIME 
THAT HAPPENED SINCE NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND ONE 
THERE ARE THEIR SHARES LET US LOOK 
OVER THE MONTH AND YOU CAN SEE 
STILL OVER THE MONTH THERE IS SOME 
GAINERS THERE ELSEWHERE WE HAVE 
SEVERN TRENT EXPECTS PROFITS TO 
RISE BY TEN PER CENT THEIR SHARES ARE DOWN 
VIRGIN RADIO RUMOURED TO HAVE 
DECIDED TO SELL ITSELF TO SNG F. T. S. E. 
ONE HUNDRED IS IT UP F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED 
THEY ARE DOWN THANK YOU IN 
FINDING STAFF IS NEVER EASY BUT 
WHEN YOUR BUSINESS IS ON TINY 
ISLAND IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AND 
CLOSES DOWN FOR FOUR MONTHS IT 
BECOMES SOMETHING OF A PROBLEM N. 
THE SECOND OF HER REPORTS FROM THE 
ISLES OF SCILLY RACHEL HAD BEEN 
LOOK AGENT THE ISSUES OF RUNNING 
SEASONAL BUSINESS IN ONE OF THE 
MOST ISOLATED PARTS OF THE U. K. 
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON 
FOR SAINT MARTIN'S ON THE ISLE THIS 
THIRTY BEDROOM HOTEL IS TWENTY EIGHT MILES OFF 
THE COAST OF CORNWALL AND 
COMPLETELY RELIANT ON THE ONE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND 
TOURISTS WHO VISIT THE ISLE OF 
SCILLY EVERY YEAR AS TOURISM IS 
SEASONAL SO IS SAINT MARTIN'S THE 
HOTEL HAS BEEN SHUT SINCE THE END 
OF OCTOBER NOW THE HOTEL AND ITS 
STAFF ARE GETTING READY TO WELCOME 
THE FIRST GUESTS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
IN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS YOU CAN START TO RELAX 
AGAIN BUT BETWEEN NOW AND THEN I 
WANT YOUR FULL ATTENTION 
IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS ALMOST THIRTY 
TONNES OF GOODS HAVE BEEN SHIPPED 
TO THE HOTEL TO KICK OFF THE START 
OF THE SEASON INCLUDING TWENTY THOUSAND 
BOTTLES OF WINE THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LITRES OF 
CLEANING LIQUID AND EXTRA 
MEMBERS OF STAFF 
WE HAVE ALLOT OF 
ARIVALS TODAY 
THE HOTEL KEEPS ON A 
SKELETON STAFF OF FIVE WHEN THE 
HOTEL IS CLOSED INCLUDING KEITH 
BRADFORD HE HAS BEEN LIVING HERE 
AND WORKING HERE SINCE ONE HUNDRED NINETY NINE THE 
FACT THAT HIS HOTEL IS NOT ONLY 
SDGE BUT IS BUILT ON AN ISLAND 
MEANS BEING ORGANISED IS HIS 
PRIORITY 
BASICALLY EVERYTHING PRIORITY FROM PAPER CLIPS TO WINE HAVE TO BE 
SHIPPED IN THEY COME IN FROM 
PENZANCE TO THE MAIN ISLAND OF SAINT 
MARY'S WHERE THEY'RE OFFLOADED TO 
ANOTHER BOAT WHICH GOES TO ANOTHER 
PART OF THE ISLAND WHERE THEY'RE 
OFFLOADED TO A TRACTOR AND TRAILER 
WE BRING THOSE TO THE HOTEL DOWN 
HERE THAT HAS TREMENDOUS COST 
IMPLICATION IT ALSO USES UP A LOT 
OF MAN HOURS I 
GETS 
THERE IS NOT 
OF MAN HOURS MUCH PASSING TRADE HERE ON THE 
ISLAND HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE HERE 
DO YOU FOCUS ON P. R. OR MARKETING TO TO BE FAIR THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF 
PASSING TRADE NOWADAYS BECAUSE WE 
HAVE A LOT OF YACHTS THAT COME 
ACROSS BUT IN GENERAL TERMS IT'S 
WORD OF MOUTH THAT IS WHAT I HAVE 
FOUND TO BE THE BEST WAY OF 
MARKETING SCILLY PEOPLE RECOMMEND 
HAVING STAYED HERE RECOMMEND IT TO 
ALL OF THEIR FRIENDS AND QUITE 
OFTEN WE WILL ASK PEOPLE AS THEY 
ARRIVE HOW DID YOU HEAR ABOUT US 
THEY WILL SAY MY FRIEND STAYED 
HERE TWO YEARS AGO RECOMMENDATION 
IS IMPORTANT THE OTHER SIDE IS P. R. 
THE FACT WE WON A MICHELIN STAR 
THIS YEAR HAS PUT US ON THE 
CULINARY MAP WELL AND TRULY WHAT 
IS A TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE TO US 
THIS YEAR 
WHEN KEITH STARTED AT 
THE HOTEL FOURTEEN YEARS AGO JUST TEN PER CENT OF 
HIS STAFF WERE FROM OUTSIDE THE U. K. 
TODAY THAT'S GROWN TO FORTY PER CENT WITH THE 
MAJORITY COMING FROM EASTERN EUROPE 
WE DO GET THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR 
STAFF FOR THE KITCHEN FROM THE U. K. 
THEY'RE U. K. TRAINED BUT IF WE ARE 
AND ALSO FOR RECEPTION IF WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT SOME WAITING STAFF 
AND THE HOUSE KEEPING STAFF THOSE 
ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO SOURCE IN 
ENGLAND 
CERTAINLY IN MY EXPERIENCE ENGLAND MANY BRITISH PEOPLE ARE NOT 
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN PURSUING 
THIS BUSINESS AS A SERIOUS CAREER 
WHERE AS IN EUROPE THEY DO SEEM TO 
REGARD IT AS BEING A VERY VERY 
SERIOUS CAREER 
WE NEED TO FIRST 
PUT THE KING SIZE SHEET ZUZANA ZUZANA SOBOTOVA IS HEAD OF HOUSE KEEPING 
ORIGINALLY FROM SLOVAKIA THIS IS 
HER THIRD SEASON ON THE ISLAND 
WHEN I FIRST COME HERE I HAD A 
PROBLEM TO FIND JOB IN SLOVAKIA 
HERE THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOBS L. 
JUST WORK HERE L. ALSO LIKE ENGLISH 
I LIKE THE LANGUAGE AND THE PEOPLE 
IT'S A DIFFERENT CULTURE THE ISLE 
OF SCILLY AND ESPECIALLY SAINT 
MARTIN'S IS MAGICAL PLACE 
WOULD LIKE TO STAY HERE AND KEEP ON 
COMING HERE 
IT'S A LONG WAY TO GO FOR A SUMMER 
JOB BUT MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED SEASONAL 
WORKERS COME TO THE ISLAND EVERY 
YEAR THE ISLE OF SCILLY COUNCIL 
ESTIMATE AT LEAST HALF OF THESE 
WORKERS ARE FROM OUTSIDE THE U. K. AND 
SAY WITHOUT THEM THE ISLAND'S 
ECONOMY WOULD BE IN SERIOUS 
DIFFICULTY DIFFICULTY WITHOUT SEASONAL WORKERS THE 
ECONOMY MIGHT BE IN DANGER OF 
COLLAPSING THE MAIN REASON IS 
BECAUSE TOURISM IS OUR MAIN INCOME 
EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF OUR G. D. P. IS TOURISM WITHOUT 
SEASONAL WORKERS IT WOULD COLLAPSE 
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LOCAL 
LABOUR TO BE ABLE TO FILL ALL OF 
THE JOBS THAT NEED TO BE DONE 
THIS WEEK IS A SOFT OPENING FOR SAINT 
MARTIN'S THEY'VE INVITED LOCAL 
PEOPLE TO COME AND STAY TO HELP 
THEIR NEW STAFF GET UP TO SPEED 
TONIGHT'S GUESTS INCLUDE TERRY WARD 
WHO OWNS A CHAIN OF SHOPS ON A 
NEARBY I'LL LAND AND JOE BADCOCK 
WHO PROVIDES ESSENTIAL TRANSPORT 
FOR TOURISTS ON HIS BOAT JOE YOUR 
BUSINESS STOPS AT THE END OF ORBGTS 
AND YOU DON'T START MAKING MONEY 
AGAIN UNTIL THE SPRING HOW DO YOU 
SURVIVE FINANCIALLY OVER THE 
WE WORK REALLY HARD IN THE WINTER SUMMERTIME PUT AS MUCH MONEY AWAY 
AS WE CAN AND DO A LITTLE BIT OF 
CARPET CLEANING DOING MY SIDELINE 
JOB THROUGH THE WINTER SEASON L. L. 
GET THROUGH TO THE NEXT SEASON AND 
START AGAIN 
TERRY YOU OWN THREE SHOPS ON SAINT 
MARY'S DO YOU CLOSE THEM DURING 
THE WINTER 
WE KEEP THEM OPEN 
BECAUSE WE HAVE STAFF TO MAINTAIN 
IT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING TO DO 
PAINTING AND DECORATING AND 
STOCKTAKING IN THE WINTER WE HAVE 
ANOTHER STORE IN DEVON ON THE 
MAINLAND WE ARE IN THE SAME BOAT 
AS JOE WE ARE VERY SEASONAL IT'S 
MAKING HAY WHILE THE SUN SHINES IN 
THE SUMMER AND DOING OUR BEST IN 
THE WINTER 
THE HOTEL'S BOODGEINGS ARE UP FIVE PER CENT ON 
THIS TIME LAST YEAR AND THEIR CHEF 
KENNY ATKINSON HAS SCORED A 
MICHELIN STAR MAKING THE START OF 
THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SEASON PRETTY PROMISING 
ALTHOUGH THE LOCATION AND THE FACTS 
OF SAINT MARTIN'S IS CLOSED FOR FOUR 
MONTHS OF THE YEAR CAN MEAN A 
CONSTANT BATTLE WITH TRANSPORT 
COSTS AND STAFFING ISSUES BUT IT 
MAKES THE HOTEL PRETTY UNIQUE WITH 
AN OUTLOOK THAT CAN HARDLY FAIL TO 
WIN OVER THEIR GUESTS 
TOMORROW RACHEL WILL BE REPORTING 
FROM A FLOWER FARM ON SAINT MARTIN'S 
WHICH HAS GONE FROM NEAR BANKRUPTCY 
TURNED ITSELF AROUND AND HAS A ONE 
MILLION TURNOVER IF YOU CAN'T WAIT 
OUR PRODUCER BEN HAS WRITTEN A 
PIECE FOR OUR WEBSITE APPARENTLY 
IT GIVES THE JUICY DETAILS ON WHAT 
WENT ON BEHIND THE CAMERA 
A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES HAVE BANNED 
THE EBBS PORT OF RICE WHILST OTHER 
MAJOR PRODUCERS HAVE CUT DOUBT 
AMOUNT THEY WILL ALLOW TO LEAVE THE 
COUNTRY FALLING SUPPLIES HAS 
RESULTED IN NUMBER PROTESTS 
EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE CUTTING 
THE TAX ON FOOD IMPORTS TO TRY AND 
CONTROL INFLATION WITHIN THE 
COUNTRY LAST YEAR I WENT TO KENT 
TO VISIT VEETEE RICE THE LARGEST 
SUPPLIER OF RICE TO THE RETAIL 
TRADE IN THE U. K. THE HEAD OF THE 
COMPANY IS MONI VARMA HE JOINS US 
NOW THANK YOU FOR DOING SO WHY IS 
THE PRICE OF RICE RISING SO 
STRONGLY 
IT APPEARS TO BE STRONG STRONGLY JUST BECAUSE THIS IS HAS SURFACED 
ONLY IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS BUT 
THIS IS WAITING TO HAPPEN IN THE 
LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS WORLD 
OUTPUT HAS BEEN FAR SHORT OF THE 
WORLD DEMAND THERE'S A SEVENTY MILLION 
NEW POPULATION BEING BORN EVERY DAY 
THERE IS MORE OF A INFLUENCE AND 
PEOPLE IN INDIA AND CHINA CAN 
AFFORD BETTER EVEN IF FIVE PER CENT OF 
INDIA'S POPULATION CAN AFFORD 
BETTER AND CAN AFFORD TO BUY ALL OF 
THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE THAT IS FIFTEEN 
MILLION PEOPLE 
SO THE DEMAND IS 
RISING VERY STRONGLY 
IT IS THIS THIS IS YOUR FACTORY IN KENT PROCESSION 
THE RICE ARE YOU ALREADY HAVING 
PROBLEMS WITH SUPPLIES 
WE ARE NOT 
HAVING PROBLEMS WITH SUPPLIES AS 
SUCH WHAT WE FEEL IS THAT 
COUNTRIES WILL BAN AND THEN THOSE 
SUPPLIES MAY NOT COME THROUGH HAS HAS THAT BAN ALREADY COME IN MANY MANY COUNTRIES THE BAN HAS COME IN HAS HAS IT AFFECTED YOUR BUSINESS HAS THE 
SUPPLIERS STOPPED SUPPLYING IT 
IT'S A PERIOD OF SETTLEMENT WHAT 
YOU ARE TRYING TO GUARD AGAINST IS 
ANY UNREASONABLE PROFITEERING AND 
PEOPLE TRYING TO RUN AWAY FROM 
CONTRACTS AND CONTRACT EWELL ONLY 
GAIGSS WE FOR ONE HAVE SET UP 
BOTH IN INDIA AND PAKISTAN AND IN 
MALAWI AND NIGERIA WE ARE 
SAFEGUARDING OUR SUPPLIES BUT EVEN 
THEN WE ARE RELIANT ON PARTLY ON 
THE UNITED STATES PARTLY ON 
THAILAND I DON'T THINK IT'S 
CATASTROPHIC AT THE MOMENT WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT BIG RISES IN 
RICE PRICES BUT IN FACT IN PRICES 
ON ALL SORTS OF FOOD STUFFS HAVE 
YOU PUT YOUR PRICE UP IT'S IT'S FILTERING THROUGH THEY WILL HAVE 
TO GO UP BUT THE TRUTH BE KNOWN 
THERE ARE SO MANY STORIES OVER THE 
LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS SOME OF 
THESE POORER COUNTRIES THAT ARE 
PRODUCE YOU WOULD HEAR OF FARMERS 
COMMITTING SUICIDE BECAUSE THEY 
CAN'T MEET THE INTEREST PAYMENTS 
SOME THEM ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT 
THEIR IMAGE RATHER THAN THE MONEY 
THEY MAKE THEY GO OUT AND COMMIT 
SUICIDE THAT HAS TO CHANGE WE 
HAVE TO REALISE THE FACT THAT SOME 
OF THIS MONEY MUST FILTER THROUGH 
BACK TO THE FARMERS 
IT'S AN 
IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT COUNTRIES WHICH SOME 
OF THE POOREST IN THE WORLD INDEED INDEED THE FACT THEY CAN GET MORE MONEY 
FOR THEIR PRODUCE FROM A LOT OF 
PERSPECTIVES THAT IS VERY GOOD 
NEWS 
ABSOLUTELY IN ANY CASE THE NEWS WORLD IS SAYING TO CHANGE TOWARDS 
THAT FROM TWO THOUSAND NINE EVERYTHING BUT 
ARMS CAN FREELY BE EXPORTED TO THE 
DEVELOPED PART OF THE WORLD 
IF I 
MAY SAY SO YOU AVOIDED THE 
QUESTION HAVE YOU HAD TO FACE 
RISING PRICES AND DO YOUR CUSTOMERS 
PAY MORE FOR YOUR RICE 
WE'VE HAD 
TO FACE RISING PRICES BUT WHEN YOU 
BREAK IT DOWN PER KILO AND HALF A 
KILO IT'S NOT CATASTROPHIC IT'S 
NOT ASTRONOMICAL WHEN YOU TAKE IT 
BACK TO THE PRODUCER AND RIGHT DOWN 
THE LINE IT DOES MAKE A BIG IMPACT 
DO YOU THINK THIS IS MAJOR LONG 
TERM SHIFT IN THE SORT OF MARKETS 
WE WE ARE FACING IN THE FOOD 
INDUSTRY 
IT IS ADAM AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY HAS NEVER BEEN FASHIONABLE THIS IS 
A COMPLETE SHIFT L. L. DON'T THINK 
THIS PROBLEM IS GOING TO RUN AWAY 
FOR THE NEXT TWO TO TEN YEARS IT'S 
A LONG TERM POLICY WE HAVE TO 
FOCUS ON PRODUCING MORE FOOD MONI MONI VARMA THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
YOU HAVE BEEN WRITING IN WITH 
WORRIES ABOUT YOUR DEPOSITS WITH 
THE ISLANDIC AND OTHER FOREIGN 
BANKS OFFERING HIGH RATES OF 
INTEREST FOR INTERNET ACCOUNTS 
AFTER WE RACED THE ISSUE YESTERDAY 
OF HOW MUCH YOU WERE COVERED BY THE 
U. K.'S FINANCIAL SERVICES 
COMPENSATION SCHEME SIMON HAS 
HIGHLIGHTED THIS ISSUE IT'S ABOUT 
WHETHER YOUR DEPOSIT IS PROTECTED 
ACCORDING TO OUR CORRESPONDENTS BY 
THE U. K. SCHEME UP TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND OR DO 
YOU HAVE TO DEPEND ON A FOREIGN 
SCHEME 
IF A FOREIGN BANK IS SCHEME OPERATING HERE IT MIGHT BE 
OPERATING AS A FULL SUBSIDIARY OF 
HERE A U. K. BANK AND YOU GET THE 
FULL U. K. PROTECTION BUT SOME OF 
THEM OPERATE THROUGH JUST A BRANCH 
HERE YET THEY'RE BUILDING AUTOPSY 
BIG BUSINESS THEN WHAT YOU GET IS 
THEIR NATIVE HOME PROTECTION SAY 
IT'S FROM ISLAND WHICH IS UP TO 
NINETY PER CENT OF YOUR DEPOSIT UP TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED 
WHEN THAT IS EXHAUSTED THE U. K. 
PROTECTION ON TOP OF THAT WHICH THE 
BANK CAN OPT INTO AND MOST OF THEM 
DO THAT COLIN IS ONE OF THE 
VIEWERS WHO HAS GOT IN TOUCH SAYS 
THAT SETS UP THE BIG QUESTION 
WOULD YOU HAVE TO GO TO AN 
ICELANDIC AUTHORITY FOR INSTANCE 
TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK 
WOULD YOU 
HAVE TO GO TO THE F. S. A. HERE IN THE 
U. K. THIS IS WHAT THE FINANCIAL 
SERVICES COMPENSATION SCHEME SAYS 
THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WHO HANDLE IT 
HERE FOR THE F. S. A. THEY SAY WHERE 
THE BANK'S HOME STATE SCHEME 
PROVIDES A LOWER LEVEL OF 
COMPENSATION THAN THE FSCS I. E. 
LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND THEN THE 
BANK MAY CHOOSE TO JOIN FSCS TO TOP 
UP TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THIS MIGHT CAUSE SOME DELAY IN 
RESOLVING CLAIMS SO THERE YOU HAVE 
IT IN ICELAND'S CASE THE FIRST 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED WOULD BE PAID BY THEM 
WOULD YOU HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH 
THE ICELANDIC AUTHORITIES IT MIGHT 
TAKE MONTHS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND 
THEN THE U. K. WOULD TAKE OVER WE WE HAVE GOT A WEBSITE THAT PEOPLE CAN 
VISIT TO LOOK AT DETAILS OF THIS 
YES THERE IS A WEBSITE FROM THE 
F. S. A. FSAGOV.UK SLASH REGISTER THAT'S 
WHY YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR BANK NAME 
AND ENTER IT IN THERE AND SEE HOW 
THEY'RE REGULATED WEATHER THEY'RE 
FULLY U. K. AND THEY WILL SAY THAT 
THEY ARE AUTHORISED OR NOT SAME SAME YONEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE ARE BACK AT TWELVE THIRTY P. M. TOMORROW WE 
WILL TALK ABOUT SAVINGS ON 
CONSUMING ISSUES ON FRIDAY 
SEE YOU TOMORROW
