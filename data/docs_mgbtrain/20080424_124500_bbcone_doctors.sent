MARILYN I'M SORRY I KNOW I'M BEING A BIT UPSET ABOUT THIS BUT 
YOU KNOW MAYBE PENNY'S RIGHT SHE'S NEVER LIKED HIM 
MAYBE SHE SEES THINGS ABOUT HIM THAT I DON'T OR WON'T 
I DON'T KNOW BUT HE'S HAPPIER NOW THAN THE WHOLE TIME I'VE KNOWN HIM 
THEN WHY IS HE BEHAVING LIKE THIS

LET GO SO YOU CAN PRACTISE VOODOO 
IT'S NOT VOODOO IT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY GIVE IT BACK 
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE A SIMILAR AGE 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING AT THE PRACTICE 
FOUR YEARS 
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO SOME OF THE STUDENTS AND ONE THING THEY'VE SAID 
THAT THEY REALLY NEED IS SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY FOR FEMALE STUDENTS 
WE'VE GOT HEAPS OF GIRLS WITH EATING DISORDERS FOR EXAMPLE AND NO ONE WHO CAN DEAL WITH IT 
WELL SURELY THE PRACTICE MAKES REFERRALS 
THEY TRY BUT THE TRUTH IS STUDENTS AREN'T THAT ORGANISED 
HALF THE TIME THEY DON'T SHOW UP 
PLUS THEY GET NERVOUS AROUND HOSPITALS 
WHAT THEY REALLY NEED IS SOMEONE WHO CAN TAKE THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS 
YOU MEAN LIKE AN OUTREACH SERVICE 
EXACTLY OR A SPECIFIC CLINIC 
ALSO THEY NEED PEOPLE THEY CAN TALK TO IN THE FIRST PLACE APART FROM ME THAT IS 
IT'S GONNA FEEL A BIT HOT O. K. HOT 
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR LAPTOP 
I MEAN THE RECIPE SAID SO 
BARRY BARRY NO WAIT 
I'LL PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE AND I'LL STICK IT BACK TOGETHER NO PLEASE 
BARRY 
BARRY IT'S ARCHIE 
I'VE KILLED HIM HELP ME 
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT HIM I JUST WANTED HIM GONE BARRY CAN YOU HEAR ME 
IT'S HAPPENED I'VE DONE IT HE'S DEAD OH GOD PLEASE HELP ME 
HE'S NOT DEAD PENNY I NEED YOU TO LISTEN WHEN DID THE SYMPTOMS START HE JUST GOT WORSE SUDDENLY 
BARRY I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME ADRENALINE 
IT SHOULD MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER 
HANG IN THERE MATE 
PENNY WHY AREN'T YOU AT SCHOOL 
WHAT 
PLEASE PLEASE MAKE HIM BETTER 
GODDESS I CALL ON THEE PLEASE FORGIVE ME 
THE AMBULANCE IS HERE AND HE'S FINE 
WE JUST NEED TO RUN SOME TESTS ON HIM AND BASICALLY KEEP AN EYE 
YOU O. K. 
I'VE REVERSED THE SPELL BUT YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE 
BARRY HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO HIS TRAVEL VACCINATION 
IT WAS NOTHING YOU DID 
BUT WHEN IT BROKE HE 
SOMETIMES IT JUST HAPPENS 
IT'S VERY RARE BUT NO 
NO I WANTED TO HURT HIM 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT'D DO BUT I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING 
IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THEN FINE 
BUT I'VE SPOKEN TO BARRY AND HE DOESN'T BLAME YOU WELL HE SHOULD 
I BROKE THE COVENANT THE WITCHES CODE 
DO NO HARM AND I DID 
BUT IT'S SO UNFAIR 
WHAT IS 
JUST ONE DAY MY LIFE IS NORMAL AND THEN MY MUM COMES HOME 
AND SAYS GUESS WHAT THERE'S A GUY AT WORK I REALLY LIKE 
DO YOU MIND IF HE MOVES IN WITH US IT'S A PRETTY BIG DEAL 
YEAH AND THEN SUDDENLY EVERYONE EXPECTS ME TO BE REALLY HAPPY FOR THEM 
BUT WHY SHOULD I I MEAN EVERY DAY MY LIFE GETS WORSE AND WORSE AND I CAN'T DO NOTHING 
EXCEPT THIS I GUESS IT'S SOME KIND OF CONTROL 
YOU THINK IT'S STUPID NO 
I MEAN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK THIS IS YOUR THING 
NO JUDGMENT 
I'M GUESSING YOU WANT YOUR MUM TO BE HAPPY RIGHT 
I'M SURE SHE WANTS THE SAME THING FOR YOU AND AS FAR AS I KNOW BARRY WANTS YOU ALL TO GET ALONG 
BUT THERE'S ONE THING STOPPING IT FROM HAPPENING I'M BEING SELFISH 
NO NOT AT ALL 
I THINK YOU'VE GOT MORE POWER THAN YOU REALISE 
NOT JUST OVER YOUR HAPPINESS BUT OVER THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO CARE FOR YOUR HAPPINESS 
AND THEY DO CARE EVEN BARRY ONLY BECAUSE OF MUM 
SO IT'S A START 
I THINK THERE'S LOTS YOU CAN DO 
I'D BETTER GO BACK INSIDE 
I CAN WALK YOU KNOW I DON'T NEED TO BE IN A CHAIR BARRY 
BARRY I'M SORRY HEY 
MUM HE HAS SUFFOCATED ONCE 
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME I'M SO SORRY 
I DON'T KNOW WHY I WAS SO ANGRY I WAS CRAZY IT'S O. K. 
I LEFT YOU FOR THAT STUPID MEETING 
YOU COULD HAVE DIED 
RIGHT WE'RE NOT GOING TO INDIA WE'RE NOT GOING 
WHAT NO NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THAT STUPID CONTRACT AND YOU GETTING ILL 
ONCE HE'S BEEN GIVEN THE ALL CLEAR HE'LL BE FIT TO FLY WE'VE ALL BEEN STRESSED 
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO WHAT 
I CAN STAY WITH NANA IT'S ONLY FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS

RUTH'S RECEPTIONIST AT THE CAMPUS PRACTICE WHAT THAT CHIT OF A GIRL 
SHE'S NO MORE THAN A STUDENT HERSELF 
THEN SHE'S PERFECT FOR YOUR TRAINING ISN'T SHE 
THINK ABOUT IT NO BAD HABITS TO TRAIN OUT 
IN OTHER WORDS HOPELESSLY INEXPERIENCED I THINK YOU'LL BE SURPRISED 
SHE DOES KNOW WHO'S BOSS WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY YOU 
AND SHE DOES KNOW THAT IT WILL BE YOU THAT'S SUPERVISING THE REORGANISATION 
I'M SURE THAT WENT DOWN WELL ACTUALLY IT DID 
SHE HAS A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR YOUR EXPERTISE 
PERHAPS I COULD TAKE HER UNDER MY WING 
POOR RUTH 
JULIA HAVE YOU GOT A MOMENT 
IT'S ABOUT THE OTHER MORNING 
DO YOU MIND IF WE TALK IN YOUR OFFICE 
IF YOU WANT ME THIS IS WHERE I AM 
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGISE FOR THE OTHER DAY WITH ELLEN

I USED TO THINK I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS 
BUT I WON'T DO THIS 
SUMMERTIME 
AND THE LIVING IS EASY 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP
