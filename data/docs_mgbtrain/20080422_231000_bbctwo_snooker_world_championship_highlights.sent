TWO JOURNEYS SNOOKER STARS WHAT 
FOR GET IN THERE BROADMOOR BROUGHT 
UP JUST BEFORE WE SEE THE 
CONCLUSION OF BRINGING REVERSES 
MARCO FU HERE IS THE CONCLUSION OF 
TWO OTHER RESULTS MARK KING OF 
ROMFORD RECORDER THE FIRST SHOCK OF 
THE TOURNAMENT BEATING LAST YEAR'S 
CHAMPION OR MARK SELBY HE PLAYS 
FORMER WORLD CHAMPION PETER EBDON 
IN THE SECOND ROUND 
I PLAYED 
REALLY GOOD STUFF AND SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN FIVE TO FOUR UP AFTER THE FIRST SESSION 
I CAME OUT 
AND GIVE IT MY ALL 
PLAYED SOLID HE HAS GOT TO THE 
FINAL OF 
THE WORLD 
AND HE'S 
A 
PLAYER BUT WHEN 
YOU PUT 
PRESSURE 
ON HIM AND PLAY WELL EVERYBODY 
MISSES I PUT PRESSURE ON THEM AND 
WHEN HE DID MISS I NEED TEN P. HE HE PLAYED GOOD SOLID SNOOKER HE DID 
NOT MAKE MASSIVE BREAKS BUT HE MADE 
FRAME WINNING BREAKS OF THE TINY 
GOT A CHANCE THAT WAS THE 
DIFFERENCE BY WAS GETTING IN AND 
STRUGGLING TO CONTROL THE WEEK AND 
A PLAYER FOR STANDARD YOU NEED TO 
BE DOING THAT TO BEAT HIM I I THOUGHT I WOULD BE A NERVOUS WRECK 
BUT I WAS AS CAMERAS ANYTHING THE 
CLOSER I GOT TO HIM THE MORE CALM 
I'D GOT L. THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE 
BEEN SHAKING LIKE A LEAF BUT IT 
WAS GOOD TO GET SO CLOSE L. HAVE 
NEVER REALLY GOING FOR HIM HERE 
AND THEN I WENT FROM THIRTY THREE TO FORTY POTTING 
THE BLACK I THOUGHT I HAVE GOT A 
CHANCE HERE 
ANOTHER MARK TWO TIME 
WORLD CHAMPION MARK WILLIAMS RAN 
OUT A WINNER OVER MARK DAVIS THERE 
HAS BEEN A MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN 
MARK WILLIAMS' FORM THIS SEASON 
NOW HE PLAYS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AND 
THEN CHINA POSES OLD EACH WEIGHING 
CHINA'S LIU CHANG IN AND OUT LAST 
SIXTEEN 
YOU SHOULD NEVER LOSE A MATCH SIXTEEN FROM THERE ARE A POSSIBLE L. AM 
JUST TAKING EACH MATCH AS IT COMES 
AND HOPEFULLY I WILL PLEA THE WE'RE 
I WAS 
PLAYING IN 
THE FIRST 
PART OF 
THE MATCH 
AND KOREA AND FROM THERE 
IT WILL BE TOUGH L. DEEPLY 
O'SULLIVAN IF HE WINS IN THE NEXT 
GAME BUT I DO NOT MIND WHO I PLAY 
REALLY I WOULD PLAY WILLIE THORNE 
OR IF I HAD THE CHOICE 
BECAUSE THEN 
THEY WOULD 
BE GUARANTEED TO GET 
THROUGH TO THE QUARTERS BUT I AM 
NOT THAT LUCKY 
WILLIE THORNE IS 
CONSULTING HIS LAWYERS 
GOOD TO SEE GRAEME DOTT CLAIMED 
THE TWO THOUSAND SIX WORLD CHAMPION ALMOST 
PULLED OUT IN THE RUN UP TO THE 
FINALS HAVING BEEN SUFFERING FROM 
DEPRESSION 
TIME TO TOM OUR ATTENTION TO THE 
DING JUNHUI MARCO FU MATCH DING JUNHUI WAS SIX TO FIVE DOWN AFTER 
FANTASTIC FIGHT BACK FROM MARCO 
NOW IT IS ABOUT SEVEN SEVEN WITH 
MARCO TO PLAY COMMENTARY BY WILLIE 
THORNE AND JOHN VIRGO 
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY BOW 
JUST OFF THE CUSHION THEY PAS 
MISSABLE TIGHT ON THE CUSHION 
HOUNDED THEY CLING TO THE CUSHION 
WE HAVE SEEN DING JUNHUI MISS REDS 
LIKE THAT AND NOW WE HAVE SEEN 
MARCO JUST A FRACTION OUT HAVING HAVING SEEN IT THE SECOND TIME I THOUGHT 
IT WAS IN L. HAVE SEEN PLENTY OF 
THOSE GO IN THIS WEEK L. KNOW WHAT 
YOU'RE SAYING WHEN YOU THEY A 
TIGHT ON THE CUSHION THEY ARE 
VIRTUALLY UNMISSABLE YOU SEE IT 
HIT THE PACK AND THEN THE SPIN 
TAKES IT AGAIN AND PUSHES THE RED 
OVER THE CORNER THAT SHOT WAS ON 
ALL THE TIME GOOD SHOT 
HE HAS THE RED TO THE RIGHT CORNER 
HE IS BRIDGING OVER QUITE FEW 
BALLS HE NEEDS TO CONTROL THE CUE 
BALL TO PLAY IN FOR THE BLACK 
WELL PLAYED GOOD SHOT 
HE IS NOT ON THE RED HE PLAYED HE 
MAY HAVE A RESERVE THE RED TO THE 
CENTRE HAS GONE SLIGHTLY WRONG HE 
HAS A GOOD POTTING ANGLE TO GET 
BACK ON THE BLACK HE HAS PLAYED 
THAT NICELY BACK IN PERFECT 
POSITION 
HE MADE A BREAK OF NINETY SEVEN IN THE 
PREVIOUS FRAME THERE AND SNOOKERED 
HIMSELF FOR THE LAST RED FROM THE 
WILL TO STOP HIMSELF MAKING A 
CENTURY FROM THE YELLOW HE CAME 
INTO THE SESSION LEADING FIVE TO FOUR SINCE 
THEN HE HAS BEEN PLAYING CATCH UP 
HE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT 
HE IS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BLUE 
HE WILL HAVE TO GO 
IN AND 
OUT OF 
BAULK TO 
GET POSITION ON HIS NEXT 
RED HE CAN TRY AND COME DOWN THE 
RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE 
ANYWHERE NEAR THAT CIRCLE WOULD BE 
O. K. 
I THINK YOU ARE BETTER THAN DENNIS 
AT THAT JOIN IT WAS A GOOD EFFORT 
THE MARGIN OF ERROR WAS PRETTY 
SHOCKED SHORT PERHAPS HE WANTED 
A LITTLE BIT MORE SIDE 
TO BRING 
THE 
WHITE LITTLE BIT CLOSER HE WILL BE 
PURSUING ANOTHER RED INTO PLAY 
HERE AS WELL THERE WAS A BIT OF A 
KICK THERE I'M SURE HE FELT HE WAS 
PUSHING THAT RED PAST THE PINK 
IT SHOULD NOTE MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
SHOULD IT WITH THOSE LOOSE REDS 
IT IS ALL ABOUT PRECISE POSITIONAL 
SHOTS WHEN YOU GET TO THIS STAGE OF 
THE FRAME 
THIS TIME PERFECT ON THE BLUE HE 
IS GIVING IT PLENTY OF THOUGHT HE 
CAN'T AFFORD ANY SILLY MISTAKES AT 
THIS STAGE OF THE FRAME AND MATCH 
HE DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE A PERFECT 
ANGLE ON THE BED HE CAN'T GET TOP 
SIDE OF THE BLUE UNLESS HE PLAYS 
WITH SIDE HE IS AND GUARANTEED 
PERFECT POSITION ON THE NEXT COLOUR 
IF HE PLAYS THERE WITH LEFT HAND 
SIDE THE RED IS MISSABLE 
HE GENERATED SOME SPIN THERE THAT 
WAS A GREAT SHOT THAT WAS A 
VIRTUALLY JUST OFF STRAIGHT RED HE 
HAS PLAYED TWO OR THREE SHOTS IN 
THIS MATCH THAT HAD BEEN SOME OF 
THE BEST IN THE TOURNAMENT IT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH HIS TROUBLES ARE 
OVER FORTY TWO POINTS IN THE LEAD BREAD 
BREAD RED IS NEEDED RED 
COLOUR RED 
HE HAS ROLLED THAT IN NICELY HE'S 
O. K. ON THE BLACK HE JUST HAS TO BE 
CAREFUL HERE JUST ONE RED NEEDED 
AFTER THE BLACK JUST LOOKING FOR 
THE CANNON BUT HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL 
IT ISN'T PERFECT HE TOOK A WRIST 
AGAIN HE COULD HAVE EASILY JUST 
PLAYED FOR THE LOOSE RED BUT ONCE 
AGAIN HE IS TRYING TO CLEAR UP AT 
ONE VISIT THIS IS FRAME BALL 
BUT IN IT GOES HE LED AT THE START 
OF THE SESSION FIVE TO FOUR THEN WENT BEHIND 
BUT NOW HE HAS HIS NOSE IN FRONT 
AGAIN NOTHING MARCO FU CAN DO 
ABOUT IT THE LAST TWO FRAMES HAVE 
BEEN ALL ABOUT DING JUNHUI HE WILL 
BE GETTING READY FOR THE NEXT FRAME 
NOW MARCO THIS ONE IS ALL GONE 
YOU WOULD EXPECT HIM TO MAKE A 
CENTURY HERE HE HAS TAKEN THESE 
REALLY WELL IT WASN'T 
STRAIGHTFORWARD EARLY ON AND A 
VERY IMPORTANT MATCH HE HELD HIS 
NERVE VERY WELL 
HE DIDN'T GET THE CENTURY LAST 
FRAME WHEN IT LOOKED A CERTAINTY 
BUT NOW HE HAS HAD TO DO AGAIN BUT 
THE KEY THING IS THE FRAME IS SAFE 
I THINK HE THOUGHT HE HAD CAUGHT 
THE YELLOW TOO THIN STANDARD 
HAS BEEN TOP DRAWER IN THIS GAME 
THIS WILL BE THE FOURTH CENTURY WE 
COULD HAVE HAD SIX OR SEVEN SUCH 
HAS BEEN THE POWERS OF BOTH PLAYERS 
IN THE GREAT BREAK BUILDING 
DEPART DEPARTMENT HAVING LOST 
FIVE FRAMES ON THE TROT ONE OF 
WHICH HE VIRTUALLY GAVE TO MARCO FU 
THIS HAS BEEN GOOD COMEBACK NINETY SEVEN 
LAST FRAME AND ONE HUNDRED PLUS IN THAT 
FRAME TO TAKE THE LEAD DING JUNHUI 
HAS GONE IN FRONT 
ON WE GO TO FRAME SIXTEEN DING JUNHUI 
IS TWENTY SIX POINTS AHEAD 
IT HAS TO BE MADE BUT THERE IS A 
GAP IT CAN BE MADE L. DON'T SEE 
ANY OTHER SHOT TO PLAY 
IS THIS FIFTY 
FIFTY OR ODDS AGAINST ODDS AGAINST 
THAT WAS DIFFICULT HE PLAYED IT 
WITH PACE TO BE FAIR I DIDN'T SEE 
ANY OTHER SHOT HE COULD PLAY AND 
HE HASN'T LEFT ANYTHING EASY ONCE 
AGAIN 
MARCO HAS TO TAKE A CHANCE AGAIN HERE AND TRY TO BRING THE GREEN OUT 
THE GREEN IS IN PLAY BUT NOT 
PERFECT GOOD CLEAN POT 
NOT A STRAIGHTFORWARD CLEARANCE 
THIS THE GREEN IS AWKWARD AND THE 
BROWN BECAUSE THE GREEN IS AWKWARD 
IT MAKES THE BROWN MORE AWKWARD HE 
HAS IT ALL TO DO TO WIN THE FRAME 
AT THIS VISIT 
THE BROWN ON ITS 
SPOT WOULD HELP PLAYING FROM GREEN 
TO BROWN 
YES HE HAS PLAYED FOR THE BROWN 
HE KNOWS NOW THAT IF HE GETS NICELY 
ON THE GREEN WITH THE BROWN ON ITS 
SPOT HE CAN JUST STUN IT DOWN THE 
CUSHION IT IS A ONE MORE GAME IT 
IS ALL ABOUT GREEN TO BROWN A 
ONE BALL GAME 
HE HAS HAD A FEW 
GOES AT THE FRAME BALL AND MISSED 
IT WILL HE GET ANOTHER CHANCE HE 
HAS PLAYED THE CANNON ABSOLUTELY 
PERFECTLY THE NEW FAVOURITE FOR 
THE FRAME NOW 
BROWN BLUE PINK NEEDED TO LEVEL 
THE MATCH 
MY MISTAKE HE IS SEVEN IN FRONT WITH 
SEVEN LEFT HE NEEDS THE BLACK AS 
WELL IT LOOKS A FORMALITY JUST 
COMPOSING HIMSELF 
IN IT GOES NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
WE HAVE SEEN IN A FRAME THAT WE 
FELT DING JUNHUI 
SHOULD HAVE 
WON 
HE HAS LOST IT IT IS EIGHT FRAMES 
A PIECE MARCO FU IS SIXTEEN BEHIND IN 
FRAME SEVENTEEN 
THE KISS ON THE PINK HELPED IT 
LOOKS AS THOUGH THE YELLOW GIVES 
HIM THE BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO COME 
DOWN THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE 
TABLE FOR 
ONE OF 
THE TWO 
REDS IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE FOR THE 
CORNER POCKET THAT WAS A BAD MISS 
IF HE GETS AWAY WITH THIS HE WOULD 
BE VERY LUCKY AND HE HASN'T THAT 
WAS A BIG BIG SHOT COULD BE VERY 
COSTLY ALWAYS A SLIGHT PROBLEM 
WHEN YOU ARE STRIKING DOWN AND 
INJECTING A BIT OF PEACE BUT YOU 
WOULD NOT EXPECT HIM TO HAVE MISSED 
THAT P. C. PACE HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO UP FOR 
ANY ONE 
OF THE 
FOUR COLOURS 
HE CAN 
GET ON 
ALL FOUR OF THEM FROM HERE 
PINK IS THE ONE HE WOULD LIKE TO 
GET ON BUT HE HAS GOT CHOICE OFF FOUR OF FOUR 
IF HE POTS THE GREEN HE MAY CANNON 
THE PINK HE IS JUST ONE OR 
POSITIONAL SHOT AWAY FROM CLINCHING 
THIS FRAME THIS LOOKS TO P. C. TO ME 
HE HAS PLAYED FOR THE RED IN THE 
RIGHT CORNER AND HE IS BETWIXT AND 
BETWEEN HE IS STRUGGLING HE IS 
NOT MAKING LIFE ANY EASIER FOR 
HIMSELF HE HAS THE RED THAN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE TABLE TO THE RIGHT 
CENTRE 
POCKET BUT THAT IS EASY TO 
CENTRE POCKET BUT THAT IS EASY TO MISS 
IT WAS A TOUGH POT HE HAS BEEN 
FORTUNATE THERE ONCE HE HAS MISSED 
IT HE COULD HAVE LEFT THAT RED 
QUITE EASILY FOR MARCO BUT HE HAS 
GOT AWAY WITH IT JUST BEGINNING TO 
SEE A FEW NERVES OUT THERE GOING 
INTO THE FINAL STAGES OF THIS MATCH 
THAT WAS A POOR SAFETY SHOT FROM 
MARCO THAT WAS A BIG TARGET THAT 
HE'LL AND BROWN BUT HE JUST 
OVERHIT IT YEAR OLD THAT HE 
WILL YELLOW 
THERE IS NO WAY THAT MARCO FU 
SHOULD HAVE LEFT THAT RED SHOULD 
HAVE COVERED IT UP CAN HE POT THE 
BROWN THE NEXT RED IS NOT GOING TO 
BE EASY ANYWAY HE THINKS HE CAN 
BUT HE COULDN'T HE NEARLY WENT IN 
OFF BUT IF YOU CAN NO MISS THE 
WILL YOU CANNOT GET GOOD ON THE 
NEXT RED L. DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY 
HE IS PLAYING IT JUST AND HOPE 
THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE SOMEWHERE 
NEAR THE RED TWENTY NINE POINTS IN THE LEAD 
SO A COUPLE OF REDS AND COLOURS 
STILL NEEDED THAT WAS A TERRIFIC 
POT HE WILL DO WELL TO POT THIS 
BLUE LOOK AT THE BACK SPIN ON THAT 
SHOT BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED HE IS TOO 
CLOSE TO THE CUSHION FOR COMFORT L. DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN DROP 
DOWN OFF 
THE TOP CUSHION AND LEAVE HIMSELF A 
RED HE WILL BE THIRTY FIVE POINTS IN FRONT 
WHEN HE POTS THIS BLUE HE COULD 
DROP IT IN DID WAIT HE IS LOOKING 
FOR ONE MORE RED POT THE RED AND 
GOLD THIRTY SIX AHEAD WITH ONLY THIRTY FIVE 
REMAINING 
GOOD POT THAT SHOULD BE THE FRAME 
CLINCHER HE IS GOING TO GO ONE UP 
WITH TWO TO PLAY 
FORTY THREE POINTS IN FRONT WITH NINETY FIVE 
REMAINING THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH 
WITH THIRTY FIVE REMAINING 
DING JUNHUI LEAVES THE ARENA TO TRY 
TO COMPOSE HIMSELF FOR ONE LAST 
LIFT TO GET THROUGH TO THE SECOND 
ROUND THEY ONE FRAME AWAY FROM HIS 
FIRST WIN AT THE CRUCIBLE THEY 
ONE 
AWAY WE HAVE HAD A FEW THRILLERS 
ALREADY THIS WEEK STEPHEN HENDRY 
OF COURSE YESTERDAY WHAT A MATCH 
THAT WAS ALI CARTER BARRY HAWKINS 
AND OF COURSE STEVE DAVIS LAST 
NIGHT IT CERTAINLY LOOKED LIKE IT 
WAS GOING TO GO TO THE DECIDER IT 
WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF THIS ONE 
DID HE HAS JUST UNDERHIT THAT 
SLIGHTLY DESPERATELY NEEDED AN 
ANGLE ON THE BLUE IF HE HAD HAD 
THE RIGHT ANGLE HE COULD HAVE 
PLAYED FOR A CHOICE OF REDS HE HAS 
JUST GOT A SLIGHT ANGLE NOT AS BAD 
AS I FIRST THOUGHT HE IS ALL AND 
THIS RED TO THE RIGHT CORNER OR 
IN THIS RED ON THIS RED 
HE CAN PLAY THE ONE RED OF THE 
THREE THERE IS DIRECTLY OF OF BLACK 
WITH PLENTY 
OF 
MAKE SURE HE PUSHES THROUGH IT HE 
HAS DECIDED TO PLAY FOR THE LOOSE 
RED BUT 
HE MAY 
NOT GET 
A BETTER 
ANGLE THAN 
THE ONE HE HAS JUST 
REFUSED 
MAYBE IT WAS IN HIS MIND REFUSED THAT HE WOULD RATHER BE PLAYING THE 
BLACK AND GOING DIRECTLY INTO THE 
REDS HE CAN THEN GENERATE MORE 
PEACE BUT HE HAS DECIDED TO PLAY 
THE CANNON IT DOES NOT LOOK AS 
THOUGH THERE IS ANY REDS AVAILABLE 
MAYBE HE IS MORE COMFORTABLE 
PLAYING THIS WAY AROUND IT IS THE 
SAME SHOT HE HAS PUSHED THROUGH 
THE MOULDED AS HE WANTED TO HE 
HAS PLAYED THAT NICELY PLAYED 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE RED 
A LADY WITH A THIRTY TWO LEAGUE ALREADY 
WITH WON THIRTY TWO POINT LEAD 
HE CAN JUST STUBBED THAT IN AND 
PLAY FOR THE BLACK 
HE COULD HAVE PLAYED THAT BETTER 
BUT THE ONE THING HE WAS MAKING 
CERTAIN OF WAS THERE HE GOT THE 
RIGHT ANGLE IN IT GOES 
JUST THIS RED REQUIRED AND IT LOOKS 
LIKE THE DECIDER IS ON THE COUNTS 
A TERRIFIC MARRIAGE WITH SOME 
TREMENDOUS BREAKS A TERRIFIC 
MATCH 
DING JUNHUI WILL FEEL THAT MATCH HE SHOULD HAVE WON THE MUCH WHEREAS 
SNOOKER TO STAY 
IN IT HIS POOR 
SNOOKER TO STAY IN IT HIS POOR SUCCESS RATE IS IN THE NINETIES 
UNBELIEVABLE POT SUCCESS RATE 
IT HAS LOOKED AT TIMES DURING THIS 
EVENING THAT HE DING JUNHUI COULD 
HAVE HEARD THIS MATCH OVER BY 
BUT THAT IS NOT 
WHAT HAS SHAME THIS MATCH COULD 
HAVE HAD SIX CENTURIES IT HAS 
ALREADY HAD FOUR 
IN THE FINAL FRAME DING HAS A THIRTY SEVEN 
POINT LEAD BUT HE IS SNOOKERED 
SOMETIMES OFF THE THIRD CUSHIONED 
YOU KNOW THE WAY THEY SLIDE DOWN I 
WOULD GIVE THAT ONE GO IF YOU 
TOUCH THE RED NEAR THE TOP CUSHION 
IT WOULD BE SAFE 
FOUL AND A MISS 
I THINK 
IT IS WORTH ANOTHER GO JOHN 
IT IS 
HE CAN GO HIGHER THE PROBLEM HE IS 
WORRIED ABOUT IS THE RED THAT IS 
JUST NEAR WHERE HE HITS THE SECOND 
CUSHION HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT 
MAKING CONTACT WITH THAT RED BUT 
IT WAS A REASONABLE LINE IT JUST 
NEEDS A MINOR ADJUSTMENT 
HE HAS GONE WIDE THIS TIME 
FOUL AND A MISS 
MARCO MAY 
HAVE IT REPLACED IF HE CAN'T POT 
THE RED AND GET OUT OF FOR THE 
BLACK 
MARCO WOULD HAVE BEEN BLACK PLAYING THAT RED IF IT WASN'T 
STRAIGHT AS QUICK AS ANYTHING HE HE HAS GONE ONE WAY AND THE OTHER SO 
HE KNOWS IT IS ON 
FOUL AND A MISS THAT WAS 
THE LINE IT JUST NEEDS A FRACTION 
MORE PLACE BUT OF COURSE THESE 
POINTS AWAY ARE MOUNTING UP AND 
CLOSING THE GAP 
PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND THERE HAVE DIFFERENT 
THE CUSHIONS ARE 
BRILLIANT SHOT WELL PLAYED IT 
TOOK FOUR ATTEMPTS BUT IT WAS WORTH 
WAITING FOR 
IT WAS SUCH A GOOD SHOT IT ISN'T A 
STRAIGHTFORWARD SAFETY SHOT THE 
THREE REDS BELOW THE PINK COULD BE 
HIT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AND HE 
COULD GO BEHIND THE BROWN BUT HE 
IS PLAYING BE DIFFERENT ONE LOOK 
AT THE WHITE HAS IT COME OUT AND 
LET HIM THE POT HE CAN GET THROUGH 
TO IT BUT IT LOOKED MUCH HE 
STRAIGHT HE ISN'T EVEN 
ENTERTAINING HIT 
THIS IS A TOUGH ONE TO TAKE ON 
BECAUSE HE IS ONLY SIXTY TO FORTY AGAINST 
POTTING IT IT IS A RELATIVELY 
STRAIGHTFORWARD SAFETY SHOT THIS 
IS DANGEROUS 
IT LOOKED STRAIGHT IT LOOKED LIKE 
HE PLAYED WITH TOP ON HE THOUGHT 
HE COULD PINCH BIT BUT HE HASN'T 
LEFT AN EASY STARTER FOR MARCO 
MARCO IS TWENTY ONE POINTS BEHIND DING 
JUNHUI SITS THERE WONDERING WHAT 
DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE BUT MARCO HAS 
THE PROBLEM OF THE SHOT I'VE 
ALWAYS FEEL YOU ARE EITHER COMMIT 
FULLY 
HE TRIED TO MAKE IT INTO A SHOT FOR 
NOTHING BY GOING OFF TWO CUSHIONS 
HE HAS LEFT THE RED CLOSEST TO THE 
CUE BALL BUT IT ISN'T 
STRAIGHTFORWARD L. DON'T BLAME HIM 
WILLIE FOR COMMITTING BUT I WOULD 
HAVE LEFT MORE ANGLE 
THAT COULD BE THE END THAT SHOT 
YES HE HAS A NICE ANGLE ON THE 
BROWN AS WELL MARCO FU CAN ONLY 
SIT THERE AND WONDER IF HIS DREAMS 
OF WINNING THIS EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD 
SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIPS HAVE GONE 
THE ODDS ARE THEY HAVE 
IT HAS BEEN A TERRIFIC MATCH IT IS 
A SHAME THERE HAS TO BE A LOSER IT 
WAS A SHAME IN MANY PEOPLE'S I IS 
THAT THESE TWO HAVE TO BE IN THE 
FIRST ROUND HAD TO MEET HE COULD 
HAVE PLAYED THAT BETTER 
THE PINK 
IS THE EASIEST SHOT OF POSITION BUT 
IT IS DIFFICULT UNDER THE COSH 
MORE PRESSURE ON THE PINK BAN ON A 
THREE QUARTER BALL BLUE 
HE HAD TO BE CAREFUL THERE HE 
PLAYED IT VERY WELL INDEED UNDER 
PRESSURE 
THAT WIPED ITS FEET AND USED ALL 
THE POCKET BUT IN IT WENT ANY 
HARDER IT WOULDN'T HAVE GONE IN 
BUT IT DID FORTY POINTS THE LEAD 
FORTY FIVE THAT AND A COLOUR NEEDED RED 
AND THE BLACK TO GO FIFTY THREE AHEAD WITH 
ONLY FIFTY ONE REMAINING MARCO HAS PUT UP 
A GREAT SHOW THE MATCH COULD HAVE 
GONE EITHER WAY HE HAS 
GREAT 
SEASON BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL 
END NOW 
BUT EVERY CREDIT TO DING JUNHUI HE 
LED FIVE TO ONE AND HIS OPPONENT THEN WON 
FIVE FRAMES ON THE TROT WE ALL 
WONDERED HOW HE WOULD RESPOND HE 
IS GOING TO WIN TEN TO NINE HE COULD HAVE 
MADE IT EASY ON HIMSELF HE HAS 
MADE A COUPLE OF ELEMENTARY 
MISTAKES THIS EVENING TO KEEP MARCO 
FU'S HOPES ALIVE BUT HE IS WELL 
OVER THE WINNING LINE NOW 
THAT WAS CARELESS BUT I THINK HE 
JUST WANTS TO GET BACK TO THE 
DRESSING ROOM NOW HE WILL BE 
DELIGHTED INSIDE JUST POTTING THE 
BALLS OUT OF HABIT REALLY HE HAS 
BEEN TESTED AND BEEN ASKED 
QUESTIONS AND HE HAS COME UP WITH 
THE ANSWERS 
HIGH COURT D. FINISHED TO A HIGH 
QUALITY MATCH IT IS A SHAME THERE 
HAS TO BE A LOSER BUT THAT IS THE 
NATURE OF THE GAME DING JUNHUI 
LIVES TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY HE WINS 
THE BATTLE OF THE EASED BY TEN 
FRAMES TO NINE 
I DIDN'T PLAY VERY WELL IN THE 
FIRST SESSION IT COST ME THE MATCH 
DING WAS FIVE TO ONE UP L. COULD HAVE WON 
THREE OF THEM BUT FROM FIVE TO ONE DOWN I 
PLAYED WELL TO GET TO THE DECIDING 
FRAME SO OVERALL I 
AM PLEASED 
I I AM HAPPY TODAY BECAUSE THIS HERE I DIDN'T LOSE IN THE FIRST ROUND IN 
ANY TOURNAMENT SO IT IS PRESSURE 
GONE 
DING JUNHUI'S SECOND ROUND GONE MATCH WITH STEPHEN HENDRY IS PLAYED
