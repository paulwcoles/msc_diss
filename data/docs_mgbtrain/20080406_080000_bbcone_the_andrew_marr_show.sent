PREPARES FOR 
WAR 
IS ALL 
IN 
THE PAPERS 
SOME VERY GOOD 
REPORT 
N. G. FROM 
INSIDE ZIMBABWE 
THOUGH THE MEDIA IS NOT ALLOWED IN 
I THINK 
THE STAGE NOW 
IS AMAZING THIS WEEKEND 
BROWN HAS 
WITH HIM 
OF A NUMBER THAT 
VERY IMPORTANT AFRICA AND ALL 
ALL 
OF THE 
AFRICA AND ALL OF THIS ALL OF THE READING 
PARTICULARLY THIS 
WRITING 
FROM INSIDE 
MICHAEL ZIMPFER 
SAYS 
THAT 
WE ARE 
AT THIS STAGE WHERE 
REALLY MBEKI 
IS ONE 
OF THE 
FEW 
PEOPLE WHO COULD MAKE A CRUCIAL 
DIFFERENCE 
INTERESTING YOU SAY THAT DIFFERENCE THAT HE IS 
OF COURSE 
PROBABLY AS 
WE SPEAK 
WITH 
GORDON BROWN HAVING 
PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT 
WHETHER HE 
IS GOING 
TO USE 
SOUTH AFRICA 
S. HUGE 
INFLUENCE WHAT 
WE REALLY 
NEED TO INFLUENCE WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO SAY 
IS IT 
TOOK VIOLENCE AND KILLING 
IN KENYA 
THEN THE 
COMMUNITY GOT 
INVOLVED THE 
COMMUNITY GOT INVOLVED THE TANZANIAN PRESIDENT FLEW IN ANNAN FLEW IN 
WE SEEM 
TO BE 
A SYMBOL OUT THE OPPOSITION HAS 
BEEN VERY DISCIPLINED VERY PATIENT AND 
YET THE 
STILL DO NOT SEEM TO WANT TO GET 
INVOLVED AND 
MBEKI 
SHOULD BE 
ON 
PLANE TO HARARE GETTING MUGABE AND 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
INTO A 
QUITE HONEST Y. THAT 
BE A MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE 
OIXT THE HELL THAT 
IS ZIMBABWE 
NOW 
AND HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME 
NOTHING NEW AND MBEKI HAS MADE IT QUITE CLEAR IN 
THE PAST HE 
IS NOT 
PREPARED TO 
LIFT A FINGER THERE 
THERE IS THIS MYTH 
OF THE 
LIBERATION STRUGGLE 
AND SINCE 
WAS 
THAT 
YOU CAN'T DO 
ANYTHING 
HIM 
IT IS SERIOUS 
NOW BECAUSE 
NOBODY NOW IN ZIMBABWE IS GOING TO 
BELIEVE THE DREADFUL MAN IF 
HE HE HAS WON THE ELECTION AFTER ALL NOBODY 
IS GOING 
TO 
BELIEVE IT THE 
NOBODY IS GOING TO BELIEVE IT THE PROBLEM IS IF 
THERE'S A 
RUN 
THEN HE WILL BRING IN ALL HIS LIKE HE 
DID AFTER 
HE LOST THE 
REFERENDUM IN TWO THOUSAND 
ARE WE 
GOING TO 
SIT BACK AND LET THIS HAPPEN THABO MBEKI HAS 
FAILED TO 
SO FAR GET 
GRIP HE 
IS NOW 
SAYING THE ELECTION GRIP WAS FREE AND FAIR THE MEDIA WERE 
NOT ALLOWED TO GO IN THE 
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA TSVANGIRAI GOT NO 
BE ON 
STATE TELEVISION HIS RALLIES 
WERE 
BROKEN UP PEOPLE D. BEAT 
N. UP 
THERE WAS BRIBERY 
JUST 
THINK 
GORDON BROWN 
TO BE 
FAIR TO 
GORDON BROWN HE 
HAS BEEN VERY STRONG 
IN ZIMBABWE 
MUCH STRONG 
R. THAN 
BUT HE 
HAS 
AN OPPORTUNITY 
THIS WEEKEND 
AND IF 
HE 
DOESN'T USE 
IT REALLY TO GET 
THABO MBEKI 
TO 
SIT UP AND CRITICISE 
FOR THE 
TIME PUBLICLY THAT'S WHAT HAS TO 
HAPPEN 
WE HAVE 
TO ISOLATE 
MUGABE LET'S STAY ON 
THE THEME 
MUGABE FAIR ESS IN A MORE DOMESTIC CON EXT 
NIGEL LAWSON 
YOU HAVE 
CHOSEN THE 
NIGEL LAWSON YOU HAVE CHOSEN THE LABOUR RE SLASH OLT ON 
THE TEN P. 
TAX 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THIS IS AN 
AMUSING 
STORY WELL IN THIS SENSE POLITICALLY IT 
REALLY IS 
POET C. 
POLITICALLY IT REALLY IS POETIC JUSTICE 
HE 
GOING TO SIMPLIFY THE TAX SYSTEM BY 
GETTING RID 
OF THIS 
BAND AND 
THEN HE 
CAN GET LOWER RATE FOR 
ABSOLUTE Y. RIGHT 
GERAINT EVANS TWENTY P. ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
BUT WHO 
COMPLICATED THE TAX 
SYSTEM 
PLACE WHO 
SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE WHO INTRODUCED THE 
TEN P. 
RATE WHICH HE 
SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE 
IT WAS BROWN 
HIMSELF 
HE IS JUST 
CLEARING UP 
HIS 
OWN MESS 
IN FACT I THINK 
THAT 
HE HAS DONE NOW 
IS RIGHT 
WHAT HE 
HAS DONE BEFORE 
IS WRONG 
BECAUSE 
YOU HAVE 
TO 
REMEMBER THAT 
THE TAX 
SYSTEM AND THE SOCIAL SECURITY 
SYSTEM HAVE TWO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM 
IS TO 
DEAL WITH 
PROBLEMS OF 
POVERTY AND 
ALL THAT AND THE TAX SYSTEM YOU 
WANT THE 
LEAST DAMAGING 
TAX SYSTEM 
ECONOMY AND 
THE ONE THAT 
SIMPLEST TO HANDLE WHAT ABOUT YOU 
A REBEL ON ALL 
THIS 
THERE HAS BEEN A VOTE ON THIS THIS 
VERY FEW LABOUR M. P.'S PUT 
ALREADY AND VERY FEW LABOUR M. P.'S PUT AN AMENDMENT DOWN L. 
SUPPORTED FRANK 
FIELD WAY BACK NOW A LOT MORE SAYING THIS 
ISN'T GOING 
I'M 
SAYING THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK I'M TOLD IT WAS 
A TORRID P. 
IT WAS 
A 
VERY TORRID P. THIS ISSUE AND OFFICE L. MUST SAY 
M. P.'S WHO HAD NEVER EVER SAID ANYTHING 
CRITICAL 
WERE BEING 
QUITE ANGRY 
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THEY 
PEOPLE IN 
CONSTITUENCY 
SURGERIES SHOWING THEM HOW 
THEY WERE 
SURGERIES SHOWING THEM HOW THEY WERE GOING 
TO BE 
WORSE OFF SO THE MOOD 
SO THE MOOD IS SUFL 
THE MOMENT 
BUT IT 
BUT IT CAN CHANGE 
WE TALKED ABOUT 
ZIMBABWE 
LET'S TALK 
ABOUT TIBET 
THE TORCH 
IS CARRIED 
THROUGH LONDON 
TODAY I WOULD 
URGE EVERYONE TO READ TODAY THE ARTICLE IN TODAY S. 
SUNDAY TIMES 
HE HAS JUST SAID IT IN 
SUCH A 
WONDERFUL WAY ABOUT WHY CHINA POLITICISE 
POLITICISING THE 
HOW 
THE TORCH 
GUG THROUGH 
LONDON TODAY 
IS A 
COMPLETE FARCE 
THERE ARE TWENTY ONE 
THEM ANYWAY 
BY THE 
WAY TORCHES 
IF ANYONE THINKS THEY 
ARE COMING 
TO 
SEE THE TORCH THEY 
THERE 
OF THEM YOU KNOW 
I THINK 
HE HAS BEEN 
GREAT ON ZIMBABWE BUT ON THIS HE HAS 
BEEN VERY VERY MILD HE 
IS NOT 
EVEN 
COMING OUT 
PUBLICLY AND SAYING 
THINK WHAT CHINA HAS DONE IN TIBET 
IS ABHORRENT 
AND HE HAS TO DO THAT 
NOW 
TO TAKE PART IN THIS 
FACADE TODAY HE 
SHOULDN'T EVEN 
THERE 
THIS IS MEANT 
ABOUT 
SPORT AND 
ARE BRINGING 
POLITICS INTO IT OVER AND OVER 
AGAIN I'M NOT 
AGAINST A 
THE SPORT 
N. G. SIDE 
OF THE 
GAMES 
I THINK 
THAT YOU 
ARE AGAINST 
A 
I THINK THAT YOU ARE AGAINST A BOYCOTT I'M 
AGAINST A 
BOYCOTT THE SPORT 
BUT THE 
PRIME MINISTER 
KEEPS SAYING 
THE 
PRIME MINISTER KEEPS SAYING THE DALAI LAMA 
SAID DON'T BOYCOTT THE 
OLYMPICS AS IF THAT 
MEANS WE 
SHOULDN'T BOYCOTT THE CEREMONY 
NICOLAS SARKOZY 
HAS GIVEN 
THE LEAD AND SAID 
UNLESS CHINA 
THE 
DALAI LAMA 
UNLESS THEY 
RE EASE 
SOME OF THE 
POLITICAL PRISON RS 
THAT YOUNG MAN SENT TO PRISON FOR 
STANDING UP FOR WHAT INTERNATIONAL 
ECONOMY WANT 
D. PEOPLE 
TO 
USE THE 
OLYMPICS FOR SO I'M 
DISAPPOINT D. ABOUT THIS I 
DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THIS I AGREE WITH 
EVERYTHING KATE 
HAS SAID BOTH 
THE WAY SHE 
SAID IT 
WHAT SHE SAID 
AND HER 
THE EXCELLENT 
COLUMN SO 
I WON'T 
ADD 
ANYTHING TO 
THAT BECAUSE SHE SAID IT ALL THERE 
IS A 
FURTHER THING 
I THINK 
THERE IS A FURTHER THING I THINK THAT 
THIS IS INHERENT 
IN 
OLYMPICS 
THEMSELVES NOWADAYS 
THE 
OLYMPICS THEMSELVES NOWADAYS THE OLYMPICS HAVE ALWAYS BECOME COMPLETE COMPLETELY POLITICISED 
THEY ARE RUN 
COMPLETELY POLITICISED THEY ARE RUN BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL 
ECONOMY WHICH 
IS COMPLETE 
Y. CORRUPT 
ECONOMY WHICH IS COMPLETELY CORRUPT AND REALLY THE TIME HAS 
COME TO SCRUB THE OLYMPICS ALL 
TOGETHER 
END THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES 
TOGETHER END THE OLYMPIC GAMES REALLY ABSOLUTELY 
THEY ARE FAR 
REALLY MORE TROUBLE THAN THEY 
ARE WORTH 
THEY DO FAR MORE HARM THAN GOOD I'M 
ALL IN FAVOUR 
OF INTERNATIONAL 
SPORT 
SPORTING ENGAGEMENTS 
BUT NOT 
THE 
OLYMPICS L. CAN 
TELL YOU 
WE HAVE 
THE 
GREAT MIS 
ORTUNE TO 
HAVE THE 
GAMES IN LONDON IN TWENTY TWO 
THAT'S WHY 
GORDON BROWN IS 
BEING SO 
FEEBLE ON 
THIS 
ANY LONDONER WHO CAN GET OUT THIS OF LONDON 
IS GOING 
TO GET OUT 
LONDON 
ALL RIGHT 
SPEAKING OF 
LONDON LONDON 
WE CAN'T LET 
THE 
BORIS JOHN 
JOHNSON STORY GO 
ENTIRELY CAN WE 
NO 
BORIS COMPLAINING IN ONE NO NEWSPAPER THAT HE 
IS 
THAT HE 
NEWSPAPER THAT HE IS THAT HE IS THE 
SUKT OF DIRT

KNOWING HER SHE HAS SAID ANY LABOUR 
SUPPORT R. WHO MENTION 
BORIS WILL 
HAVE TO 
PAY A 
FINE 
BECAUSE YOU

CONCERNED WITH 
MAKING YOU 
FEEL THAT YOU 
REALLY ARE

PLOTS WHERE 
SOMETHING HAPPENS 
THEN SOMETHING 
ELSE HAPPENS AND GRADUALLY YOU 
ACCUMULATE A PICTURE 
OF THE 
WORLD 
ACCUMULATE A PICTURE OF THE WORLD THAT 
IS A 
KIND 
OF A 
PLOT IN ITS OWN 
RIGHT 
IT IS A 
PROGRESSION THROUGH 
RIGHT IT IS A PROGRESSION THROUGH WHICH YOU 
DISCOVER WHAT 
THE THING 
WHICH YOU DISCOVER WHAT THE THING IS ABOUT THE THING WITH HAPPY GO LUCKY 
IS YOU 
REALLY GO 
ON A JOURNEY WITH 
POPPY THROUGH WHICH YOU GET THE 
YOU 
COULD BE 
FORGIVEN FOR 
WONDERING AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE 
FILM 
WHETHER YOU 
TO GET ON 
WITH THIS PERSON 
BUT YOU 
VERY QUICK 
QUICKLY 
GET TO 
LIKE HER AND 
I HOPE 
QUICKLY GET TO LIKE HER AND I HOPE YOU FIND WIND UP LOVING HER WITHOUT GIVING 
TOO MUCH 
A WAY ANYONE 
WHO HAS NOT HAD 
THEIR DRIVING 
LESSONS 
MIGHT BE 
PUT OFF BY PARTS 
THIS FILM WELL THERE 
IS THE 
MOST 
FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE 
BY THE 
DRIVING 
INSTRUCT R. ONE THING 
I HAVE 
TO SAY 
SOMEBODY THE 
OTHER DAY 
SAID 
SOMEBODY THE OTHER DAY SAID THIS IS A STEREOTYPICAL DRIVING INSTRUCTOR 
NOT I THINK 
THAT 
IS RUBBISH 
ALL THE GOOD DRIVING 
I WOULD HATE ALL THE GOOD DRIVING INSTRUCTORS OUT THERE TO ONE ONE THING I 
THOUGHT ABOUT 
THIS FILM 
SIMPLY 
THAT THE 
COLOURS OF 
IT SEEM 
TO GLOW 
A LITTLE MORE 
BRIGHT Y. THAN 
I'M USED TO IN 
IS THERE 
A REASON FOR THAT WELL 
WE WANT 
THE FILM TO BURST WITH POSITIVE 
ENERGY WHICH IT DOES L. ALWAYS WORK 
ENERGY WHICH IT DOES I ALWAYS WORK AND HAVE 
FOR MANY 
YEARS WITH 
THE 
CINEMA 
N. G. TO 
FER 
DYKE POPE 
HE SHOT 
THIS FILM 
JUST AT THE 
MOMENT WHEN 
L. TO 
DO THIS 
FILM 
AND DECIDED TO SHOOT IT WIDE SCREEN 
FIRST TIME I EVER MADE A WIDE 
SCREEN FILM FUJI CAME ON 
THE SCENE 
WITH A GRAND NEW STOCK AND 
DECIDED TO USE IT SO YOU HAVE THE WONDERFUL PRIMARY 
COLOURS BUT 
IT IS 
ALSO ABOUT THE DESIGN AND THE 
COSTUMES SOME 
EARLIER WORKS COSTUMES SEEM TO PAINT A PICTURE 
OF BRITAIN 
IN 
THE THATCHER 
YEARS 
THEN YOU 
WENT 
BACK FURTHER WITH 
VERA DRAKE 
BRITAIN IN 
THE FIFTY 
ARE YOU 
SAYING 
BRITAIN NOW 
A LOT 
OF PEOPLE 
WOULD SAY 
THESE 
GRIM TIMES 
WE ARE 
LIVING IN 
CLIMATE CHANGE LOTS 
OF POLITICAL 
DEPRESSION AROUND NO ONE 
KNOWS WHAT 
IS GOING 
TO HAPPEN 
BUT IT IS 
VERY 
UP EAT I THINK 
THE REAL POINT ABOUT UPBEAT HAPPY GO LUCKY FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE 
IS THIS 
WE ARE 
IN TOUGH TIMES 
ARE 
DESTROYING THE PLANET DESTROYING EACH OTHER L. 
THIS IS 
BY THE 
WAY JUST A BRITISH 
ISSUE 
GLOBAL ISSUE 
WHILE 
THAT'S HAPPENING 
AND 
WHILE VERY 
PROPERLY SHOULD 
LAMENT IT AND 
VERY PROPERLY SHOULD LAMENT IT AND YOU KNOW BE PESSIMISTIC 
PEOPLE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT 
THERE 
ON THE GROUND 
GETTING ON 
WITH IT AND 
POPPY IS 
ONE 
OF THOSE 
PEOPLE NOT ONLY 
IS SHE 
SIMPLY 
POSITIVE AND ANTI MISERABLE 
BUT SHE 
IS A 
TEACHER SO YOU NEED TO 
IS A TEACHER SO YOU NEED TO SUBMERGE YOURSELF 
IN 
SUBMERGE YOURSELF IN THE ENJOYMENT OF LIVING 
DESPITE ALL 
THE 
IT IS 
A 
IT IS A MORE SPECIFIC THING IF YOU COMMITTED AS POPPY IS AND THE 
POPPIES OF THIS WORLD ARE TO 
TEACHING TO CHERISH 
N. G. THE 
FUTURE 
KIDS THAT GENERATION THEN YOU 
KNOW 
YOU CAN'T SIMPLY 
WROUNG YOUR 
HANDS BASICALLY 
I CAN'T 
FINISH 
HANDS BASICALLY I CAN'T FINISH WITHOUT ASKING YOU ABOUT CHARLTON 
HESTON ON THIS DAY THAT HIS DEATH ANNOUNCED YES 
I THINK 
ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAS DIED 
OBVIOUSLY IN THE 
LATTER PART 
OF HIS LIFE 
WE HAVE 
ALL 
LATTER PART OF HIS LIFE WE HAVE ALL KIND 
OF PAINT 
AS THE BADDIE 
AND YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO 
COMMENT ON HIS 
HIS POLITICS HIS 
POLITICS AND 
HIS GUN LOBBY 
ME HIS GREAT ST SINGLE ACHIEVEMENT AFTER ALL 
I HAVE 
BEEN HERE TALK 
ABOUT CHARACTER ACT 
N. G. 
HE WAS 
NOT 
A CHARACTER ACTOR 
ACTOR 
WHO 
DID HIMSELF 
AND YOU GOT 
YOU GOT CHARLTON HESTON 
BUT HIS GREAT ST ACHIEVEMENT WAS 
THAT HE 
ACHIEVEMENT WAS THOUGHT ONLY THAT HE DID PROBABLY 
HIS BEST PERFORMANCE IN 
DID PROBABLY HIS BEST PERFORMANCE IN TOUCH 
OF EVIL 
BY ORS 
N. WALES 
BUT HE 
TOUCH OF EVIL BY ORS N. WALES BUT HE SUGGESTED ORS 
N. WALES 
HE WAS CAST 
IN 
THE PART

D. ORS 
IN THE PART AND SUGGESTED ORS N. WELLS THEY DECIDED TO TURN THIS 
WELLS THEY DECIDED TO TURN THIS CHARACTER 
REGULAR 
MEXICAN AND THEY 
INTO A MEXICAN AND THEY DID EXTRAORDINARY THINGS TOGETHER THINK 
IT IS HIS 
MOST INTERESTING AND 
MOST OFF EAT PERFORMANCE IN WHAT 
A GREAT FILM 
LET'S HOPE THAT 
SOMEBODY HAS 
THE WIT TO RE 
RE RUN 
IT 
IN 
FEW DAYS 
MUCH INDEED 
NOW WHEN KEVIN RUTD 
WAS ELECT D. 
LABOUR 
OF AUSTRALIA 
LATE LAST YEAR HE IMMEDIATELY SET 
ABOUT REVERSING MANY PREDECESSOR S. POLICY HE 
SIGNED THE 
KYOTO TREATY APOLOGISED TO 
ABORIGINAL AUSTRALIANS AND SAID 
ANOTHER VOTE ON 
AUSTRALIA SHOULD BECOME A REPUBLIC I MET UP WITH 
KEVIN RUDD

COMING WEEK 
YOU HAVE BEEN IN CHINA MANY TIMES WHAT THEREFORE 
DO YOU

PEOPLE WHO ARE PROTESTING VOCIFEROUSLY ABOUT TIBET AND SAYING 
ACTUAL Y. 
LEADERS LIKE 
SHOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN 
OF GAMES 
THE 
DALAI LAMA 
HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN 
THE DALAI LAMA HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN TO DIALOGUE 
UNTIL THE 
RE 
RELGS HAS 
STOPPED 
WHEN THE WORLD COMMUNITY STOPPED DECIDED TO ACCORD BEIJING THE GAMES 
WAY BACK WHEN RIGHTS ABUSE 
IN 
CHINA AT 
THAT TIME 
AND IN TIBET 
THEN AS 
WELL 
THESE 
RECENT EVENTS 
OF COURSE 
HAVE 
INVOLVED VIOLENCE 
AND 
WE URGE 
RESTRAINT 
OF ALL 
RESTRAINT ON THE PART OF OF ALL PARTIES AND 
WE URGE 
THAT THE 
AUTHORITIES DEAL 
DALAI LAMA 
LAMA'S REPRESENTATIVES TO WORK OUT A 
BETTER OUT O. M. E. FOR THE TIBETAN PEOPLE 
BUT MY 
VIEW HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
AND 
I SAID 
IT 
AGAIN TODAY 
BOYCOTTS 
DON'T WORK WHAT 
DOES WORK 
DON'T WORK WHAT DOES WORK IS SUSTAINED ENGAGEMENT WITH THE 
CHINESE AND 
REGISTERING FIRM Y. AND 
CLEARLY OUR VIEWS ON THESE 
RIGHTS PRACTISES 
YOU HAVE BEEN 
INVITED D. 
I THINK 
PERSONAL Y. 
INVITEDED I THINK PERSONALLY BY THE 
CHINESE PRESIDENT 
TO THE 
GAMES WITH YOUR FAMILY 
YOU GOING TO ATTEND COME 
WHAT MAY NO HAVE SAID 
TO THE 
EVER SINCE 
THAT INVITATION 
WAS 
ATTEND 
D. OF 
COURSE 
WE ACCEPTED 
IT IN 
PRINCIPLE 
BUT IT WAS 
SUBJECT TO 
THAT 
IS STILL 
THE 
POSITION THE GAMES 
SOME 
WAY OFF AND WE'LL MAKE OUR DECISION 
IN DUE SEASON OF COURSE 
IS CLOSE TO CHINA COMPARATIVE Y. 
SPEAKING YOUR MARKET OPEN TO 
CHINESE PRODUCE 
AND SO ON HOW 
THE NEED FOR ECONOMIC 
GROWTH AND 
THE 
DIALOGUE WITH 
CHINA 
WITH ACTUAL Y. 
PUTTING REAL 
PRESSURE 
ON 
TO THE 
CHINESE ANYONE 
OVER TIBET OVER OTHER 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
PROBLEMS WELL 
A PROBLEMS QUESTION 
CONSIST NT YOU 
NEED TO RECOGNISE WHERE CHINA HAS 
COME FROM AND WHERE 
IT IS GOING 
TO 
HOW FAR IT HAS GOT AS I SAID THE CHINA 
OF THE 
CULTURAL REVOLUTION 
THE CHINA WHICH 
IS EX 
ORT 
N. G. RADICAL 
COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY AROUND THE WORLD 
IS NOT 
THE CHINA 
OF TODAY 
BUT IT IS 
STILL A ONE PARTY STATE STILL 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
ABUSE 
BUT IT IS 
IMPORTANT 
THROUGH THE 
PROCESS OF 
ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT THE OVER WATCH 
OF GLOBAL 
SATION THE EMERGENCE 
OF 
NEW TECHNOLOGIES THE INTERNET AND 
TO ENGAGE THE 
EVERYTHING ELSE TO ENGAGE THE CHINESE AT 
EVERY LEVEL BE FRANK 
ABOUT THE 
DIFFERENCES 
PARTICULARLY 
ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
INCLUDING ON 
TIBET 
FRANK 
ABOUT THE 
CONTINUED CO OPERATION

COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP NO ONE PRE 
PRETEPDZ IT IS 
NOT

A 
PRETEPDZ IT IS NOT IT IS NOT A BLACK WHITE EITHER OR THING 
BLACK SLASH WHITE EITHER OR THING BUT I THINK IN AUSTRALIA WE TRY TO 
PROSECUTE THIS DOUBLE JAENLD AND DO IT TO THE 
ABILITY WHAT 
ARE YOU 
GOING 
TO DO 
ABILITY FOR THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AUSTRALIA BECAUSE YOU MADE 
THAT ONE 
OF YOUR 
CAMPAIGN PLEDGES WELL THE 
WELL THE FIRST DAY 
OF THE 
PARLIAMENT

AFTER THE ELECTION 
OUR GOVERNMENT I 
DELIVERED A 
FORM L. 
APOLOGY IN 
THE PARLIAMENT 
TO 
APOLOGY IN THE PARLIAMENT TO INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS 
OF THE 
STOLEN 
INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS OF THE STOLEN GENERATION JUST FOR 
THOSE WHO 
DON'T GENERATION UNDERSTAND THE GENERATION LOST 
BECAUSE 
IT IS 
BECAUSE STOLEN GENERATION BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY FROM THE EARLY PART THE TWENTY 
H. CENTURY 
TO 
THE SIXTIES SEVENTIES THE POLICY USUALLY BY AUSTRALIAN STATE 
GOVERNMENTS TO 
RE 
STATE GOVERNMENTS TO REMOVE ABORIGINAL CHILDREN FROM PARENTS AND PUT THEM 
CARE 
OF VARIOUS 
INSTITUTION THIS RESULT 
RESULTED IN 
TENS OF THOUSANDS 
OBVIOUS RIDGE AUSTRALIANS MANY WHOM 
ARE A 
IVE 
TODAY MANY 
OF WHOM 
I 
MET PERSONAL Y. SO I 
THOUGHT IT WAS 
IMPORTANT TO RIGHT THAT WRONG IT HAS 
UN INISHED BUSINESS 
FOR AUSTRALIA BUT THEN MOVE ON 
BRIDGE 
OF RESPECT

FINANCIAL CRISIS OUR PRODUCTIVITY AGENDA AT HOME 
DEALING WITH 
THE 
INDIGENOUS QUESTION YOU SPOKE ABOUT 
BEFORE AND ALSO EXTEND N. G. AUSTRALIA AUSTRALIA'S VOICE 
INTO THE 
WORLD TO DEAL WITH 
THESE GLOBAL PROBLEMS 
LOTS TO ABOUT LOTS TO DO BUT 
YOU WOULD 
ABOUT LIKE TO SEE AUSTRALIA BECOME A 
REPUBLIC YOU 
YOURSELF WOULD LIKE 
TO 
SEE REPUBLIC I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A 
REPUBLICAN 
IT IS IN 
OUR 
THE PARTY 
IT IS NOT 
A TOP ORDER 
PRIORITY 
SAY THIS 
MAJESTY THE QUEEN 
IS REGARD 
D. WITH 
MUCH RESPECT 
A ROSS ALL AUSTRALIANS

BEEN BORN SHE HAS BEEN 
THERE FOR 
A 
BEEN BORN VERY LONG TIME 
ONE 
OF THOSE 
CASE WHERE POSSIBLY 
BY THE 
TIME IT 
BECOMES KING 
CHARLES 
OR 
WHATEVER HE 
DECIDES TO 
CALL 
HIMSELF 
THAT'S THE 
MOMENT TO MOVE 
ON FOR AUSTRALIA

SUMMER AUGUST 
IS THE 
FINAL DATE HOW 
MANAGE TO 
FINAL DATE ACHIEVE THAT AND STILL BE WARM Y. WELCOMED BY 
GEORGE BUSH 
IN 
WASHINGTON 
BIT 
ACHIEVEMENT 
WASN'T IT 
WELL 
ACHIEVEMENT WASN'T IT WELL I BELIEVE IN 
JUST SAYING 
WHAT YOU 
GOING TO DO AND BEING VERY BLUNT 
ABOUT IT 
BEFORE THE ELECTION 
FACT I MET 
PRESIDENT BUSH 
WHEN HE 
VISIT 
D. SYDNEY 
LAST YEAR 
LEADER 
OF THE 
OPPOSITION 
TIME I SAID OUR PARTY WAS COMMITTED 
TO BRINGING OUR FORCE OUT 
OF IRAQ 
I WANT 
NEGOTIATE WITH HIM IF 
WE WON 
THE ELECTION THE PRECISE 
TIMETABLE 
OF IT 
I THINK 
THE 
ATTITUDE OF A RE 
ESPONSIBLE ALLY 
IS 
NOT TO LEAVE YOUR ALLY IN 
THE LUNCH 
THE WAY FRIENDS DO 
BUSINESS 
BUT ON 
TOP OF THAT 
MY OVER IDING VIEW AS 
SOMEONE WHO 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER 
OF THE 
U. S. ALLIANCE EVER SINCE I 
HAVE BEEN 
IN PUBLIC LIFE AND 
THAT AS A DIPLOMAT 
IN AUSTRALIA THAT AMERICA IS AN OVERWHELMING 
FORCE FOR GOOD JUST 
HAPPEN TO DIS GREE ON THIS 
OF POEUL 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALK 
OF POEUL ABOUT THIS GREAT GESTURE YOU 
DID TO 
GEORGE BUSH 
TIPPING YOUR 
STETSON TO HIM 
IT WAS 
JUST ME 
SAYING HOUD SLASH ACTUAL Y. JUST A QUIRK QUIRKY SENSE 
OF HUMOUR 
ONE 
OF THE 
PEOPLE WHO HAS BEEN AT THIS IN ORM L. GATHERING 
THABO MBEKI

N. G. SITUATION 
IN 
STIFRP WAY THE STIFRPWAY IN ZIMBABWE THE STIFRPWAY 
PUT TO 
THABO MBEKI 
WAS 
THAT THE 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
HAS TO 
PUT OUT THE 
A MATTER 
URGENCY SECONDLY THAT IF 
RESULT OF 
THAT AND 
WITH THE 
CONCURRENCE OF THE 
PARTIES THEY 
DECIDE THAT 
IT IS APPROPRIATE 
FOR 
THERE 
TO BE 
A RUN 
OFF ELECTION 
IT 
MUST BE 
HELD SOON 
THAT 
IS WITHIN 
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS CONSIST 
NT WITH 
THE PROVISION 
OF SIMPLE 
WEAN LAW 
WAS HEARTENED 
TO HEAR THAT 
MBEKI 
SHARES THAT 
VIEW AND 
EXPRESSING IS VIEW DIRECTLY TO BOTH 
SIDES IN 
HARARE YOU 
ARE A 
YOU ARE A RECENTLY ELECT 
D. LEFT 
OF CENTRE 
LABOUR LEADER ANY ADVICE FOR 
BROWN WHOSE 
PARTY HAS BEEN IN POWER 
FOR A LONG TIME STRUGGLING I KNOW YOU AND THE 
AROUND THE HEAD AS

DEVELOP GOALS 
AND 
GLOBAL POVERTY 
WERE IT 
NOT FOR 
GORDON BROWN 
GOING BACK 
TO WHEN 
WAS CHANCELLOR 
FRANK 
Y. THE 
GLOBAL 
AGENDA 
WOULD NOT 
BE AS ADVANCED AS 
SIMILAR Y. ON CLIMATE CHANGE 
I THINK 
THAT NEEDS 
TO BE 
RECOGNISED 
FOR ITS OWN MERITS 
WE ALL 
GO 
THROUGH UPS 
AND DOWNS IN DOMESTIC 
POLITICS AND I'M SURE I'LL GO 
THROUGH MINE 
FROM AN INTERNATIONAL 
YOU HAVE A 
MINISTER FOR DOMESTIC MATTERS I'LL 
MINISTER FOR DOMESTIC MATTERS I'LL LEAVE 
YOU IN 
THE MEDIA TO SORT THAT 
OUT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOR OUT US THIS MORNING GOOD 
WITH YOU

WEEKS FOR THE 
LIB DEM

AQAOIRD A 
CERTAIN NEW NICKNAME 
AQAOIRD A CERTAIN NEW NICKNAME AS A RESULT

TO CHINA AND 
IS RATHER 
OF THE 
SOFTLY 
DIPLOMAT 
C. ATTITUDE 
WHEN 
IT COMES 
TO 
DIPLOMATIC ATTITUDE WHEN IT COMES TO TIBET 
GORDON BROWN IS 
GOING 
TO BE 
TIBET GORDON BROWN IS GOING TO BE ACCEPTING THE 
TORCH 
I THINK 
MIS AKE 
I THINK 
THAT 
NEED 
TO BE 
QUITE CLEAR 
BEING 
SHRILL ABOUT 
TBUT NONLS 
BEING SHRILL ABOUT TBUT NONETHELESS 
BEING SHRILL ABOUT TBUT NONETHELESS UN OMPROMISING WITH THE 
CHINESE THAT 
IF THEY 
BECOME THE FULL 
COMMUNITY THAT 
THEY WANT AND THE 
OLYMPIC 
CROWN 
FOR 
OLYMPICS IS A CROWNING SYMBOL FOR THE 
CHINESE OF THE 
ACCEPTANCE THEY 
HAVE TO 
PLAY BY THE 
RULES AND THE 
CORNERSTONE OF THOSE RULES IS 
WE ALL 
RESPECT THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO 
WHICH WE THE BRITISH HAVE ALWAYS ATTACHED GREAT SIGNIFICANCE 
I THINK 
THAT'S WHY 
PPROPRIATE THAT 
GORDON BROWN IS 
PARTICIPATING IN 
THIS TORCH BEARING CEREMONY TODAY 
AND 
I THINK 
WRONG FOR 
HIM 
TO GO 
OPENING CEREMONY 
ON 
EIGHT AUGUST 
UNLESS THE 
EIGHT AUGUST UNLESS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
WERE TO 
SHOW REAL STEPS 
HAVE 
DALAI LAMA 
HAVE TALKS WITH THE DALAI LAMA ALLOW JOURNAL 
STS INTO 
TIBET AND RAT 
NIGH THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON 
HUMAN AND 
CAOUFTS WHICH 
THEY 
HUMAN AND CAOUFTS WHICH THEY RATIFIED TEN 
YEARS AGO 
NOT 
SIGNED ISN'T IT 
SHALLOW TO 
BOYCOTT SIGNED BITS 
OF THE 
CELEBRATION AND 
YET GO 
ALONG 
AND PARTICIPATE 
IN 
THE GAMES 
I'M VERY CLEAR I 
DON'T THINK THERE 
FULL SPORT 
N. G. BOYCOTT 
INDEED THE 
HIMSELF 
DOESN'T THINK THERE 
SHOULD BE 
ONE 
SHOULDN'T BE 
NAIVE 
THERE 
IS POLITICS 
IN THIS ONE CAN'T 
ISOLATE IT COMPLETE Y. FROM AND ONE 
CERTAINLY CAN'T 
JUST BRUSH 
OVER 
THE FACT 
THAT 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
BEING SYSTEMATICALLY ABUSED ON AN 
EXTRAORDINARY SCALE IN CHINA AND 
INDEED IN 
COUNTRIES WHERE 
CHINA HAS 
INDEED IN COUNTRIES WHERE CHINA HAS A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE USED TO NEGOTIATE WITH 
CHINESE OFFICIAL 
FOR 
A LONG TIME IN CAREER BEFORE I WENT 
INTO POLITICS 
AND THEY 
ARE VERY 
SENSITIVE TO THESE 
SENSITIVE TO THESE KIND OF THINGS THAT'S WHY 
I THINK 
CALIBRATING 
APPROACH THAT 
ARE NOT 
APPROACH THAT SAYS WE ARE NOT ENTERING INTO 
THESE 
THEY ARE 
MONEY L. 
DUTIES UNLESS YOU TAKE SOME 
STEPS IN 
THE 
RIGHT DIRECTION IS 
THE KIND LEVERAGE THAT 
CAN CAN 
AND MUST WORK 
LEVERAGE THAT CAN CAN AND MUST WORK LET'S TURN TO YOUR OWN PARTY 
THERE'S AN 
EXTRAORDINARY STORY IN 
WHICH I'M 
SURE YOU HAVE SEEN WHICH 
SAYS IN 
THE ELECTION 
BETWEEN 
YOURSELF AND 
CHRIS HUHNE 
ACTUAL Y. 
WAS A WHOLE LOT 
OF POSTAL 
VOTES 
DIDN'T MAKE 
IT IN 
TIME 
THE CHRISTMAS POST N. D. HAD THEY DONE HE 
WOULD HAVE 
BEEN THE LEADER NOT 
YOU MY UNDERSTANDING IS 
IT IS 
A YOU COMPLETE NON ENSE L. ANYONE HAS 
COUNTED THOSE 
POSTAL 
VOTES SO IT 
WASN'T CHRISTMAS 
VOTES EARLY 
FOR YOU 
I 
DON'T THINK SO 
EARLY FOR YOU CAN'T COMMENT ON A PIECE WHICH THINK 
IS BASED 
ON NO FOUNDATION OR 
FACT WHATSOEVER RIGHT O. K. SO YOU 
ARE CONFIDENT 
THAT 
YOU WERE ELECT 
FAIRLY AND SQUARE Y. I 
CERTAINLY AM 
FAIRLY AND SQUARELY I CERTAINLY AM YOU ALSO SAID 
AT THE TIME 
OF THAT 
LEADERSHIP CONTEST 
THAT YOU 
WESTMINSTER WAS BECOMING BIT 
OF A 
KIND 
OF THEATRICAL 
DOG 
HOUSE OR SOME 
EXPRESSION LIKE 
THIS 
IT 
MIGHT BE SAID 
YOUR OWN INTERVIEW 
FOR 
G. Q. MAGAZINE 
HAS NOT HELPED YOU 
DID TALK 
ABOUT THE 
NUMBER OF SEXUAL 
PARTNERS YOU HAVE HAD 
BUT YOU 
YOU WON'T TALK ABOUT YOUR DRUG USE USE NOW 
A LOT 
OF PEOPLE 
WILL SAY 
HOLD ON MINUTE ONE 
WHATEVER YOU 
THINK ABOUT IT 
IS ENTIRELY 
LEGAL 
AND THE 
OTHER ONE 
ISN'T THE THING 
THAT 
IS ILLEGAL 
IS WHAT 
OUGHT 
TO BE 
ABLE TO TALK ABOUT AND 
BE HONEST ABOUT IN THIS MODERN 
MEDIA ENVIRONMENT YOU AS A 
POLITICAL LEADER YOU ENTER 
THESE SPLIT SECOND CONVERSATION AND INTERVIEWS THEY GET 
INTERPRETED AND 
INTERVIEWS THEY GET INTERPRETED AND RE 
NTERPRETED AND 
OVER NTERPRETED 
BE BLE 
NOT NICE 
NOT GOING TO ADD TO IT DO YOU 
REGRET WHAT YOU SAID 
TO IT I'M 
TO START WITH 
BENEFIT 
OF HINDSIGHT 
START RE INVENT 
RE INVENTING WHAT 
DID OR 
HAPPEN I'M IF I HAVE ANY REGRETS 
IT IS 
THAT I DON'T WANT IT 
A 
DISTRACTION FROM THE 
THINGS I CARE 
PASSIONATE Y. ABOUT YOU JUST MOVE 
PASSIONATELY ABOUT YOU JUST MOVE ON I'M JUST SORT 
OF 
IN THE CON ON CONTEXT OF WANT 
N. G. A 
MORE CANDID 
POLITICAL CONVERSATION YOU SAY NOT 
LEAST BECAUSE 
I KNOW ALMOST 
ANYTHING I SAY WILL ADD 
FUEL TO 
THE 
ANYTHING I SAY WILL ADD FUEL TO THE FIRE BEING CANDID IN A MEDIA 
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THAT 
IS DEMANDED 
OF YOU ALL THE TIME 
SOME 
RISKS AND 
HAS SOME DISADVANTAGES 
RISKS AND HAS SOME DISADVANTAGES WHEN IT COMES TO CANNABIS OR OTHER 
DRUGS POLICY 
REALLY MATTERS 
THE 
DECISION YOU TAKE 
REALLY MATTER 
IT NOT 
THEREFORE FAIR 
TO SAY THAT 
HOW YOU BEHAVED EARLIER ON MATTERS TOO AND PEOPLE HAVE A 
RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT MY OWN 
VIEW 
IS HOW 
A 
POLITICIAN BEHAVES 
TWENTY 
VIEW IS HOW A POLITICIAN BEHAVES TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
BEFORE 
THEY'VE EVEN 
OF GOING 
INTO POLITICS 
HAS NO 
BEARING ON WHAT THEY DO AS A 
POLITICIAN MY OWN VIEW ON DRUG 
CLASSIFICATION WHICH HAS BEEN IN 
THE NEWS 
THIS WEEK AS 
APPEARS TO HAVE SECOND 
GUESSED THE 
DRUG MIS 
ADVISORY ECONOMY 
IS THAT 
TO 
TAKE THE 
POLITICS OUT 
OF THIS 
DEBATE 
ON CLASSIFICATION 
IT IS NO 
GOOD 
AND GO WITH THE ECONOMY WORDS I PERSONAL Y. 
UP WORDS THE STATUS 
OF THE 
ECONOMY AND 
THE 
ABILITY OF THE 
ECONOMY TO 
ACT 
INDEPENDENT Y. AND MAKE 
INDEPENDENTLY AND MAKE RECOMMENDATION WHICH CAN'T SIMPLY 
RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH CAN'T SIMPLY BE BRUSHED A WAY BY A 
PRIME MINISTER 
KEEN TO GRAB A HEADLINE 
SO WHEN 
THEY SAY WE CAN'T 
CHOP AND CHANGE 
THEY SAY WE CAN'T CHOP AND CHANGE ON THE 
CAT GROUND INVASION OF 
CANNABIS 
Y. THE KIND 
OF THING 
WHERE YOU NEED 
A DIS 
DISPASSIONATE VIEW TO SEE WHAT 
THE LINK BETWEEN CANNABIS USE ITS 
POET C. I. IN ITS NEW FORMS ITS LINK 
TO THE 
USE OF OTHER 
MORE POWERFUL 
DRUGS AND THE 
ECONOMY IN 
QUESTION 
DOES NOT 
BELIEVE IF 
REPORTS TO 
HAVE ANY CREDIBILITY 
DOES NOT 
BELIEVE THE PRESENT CAT 
SHOULD BE 
CHANGED YET AGAIN LET'S 
LET'S TURN 
TO THE 
OTHER GREAT CONTROVERSY 
MOMENT WHICH 
IS THE 
TEN P. 
TAX 
BAND IN SOME RESPECTS AS 
BAND IN SOME RESPECTS AS NIGEL LAWSON WAS SAYING LABOUR HAS GONE 
TO A SIMPLER SYSTEM GONE TO A TWENTY P. BAND WHAT 
WITH THAT 
I THINK 
VERY 
I THINK 
IT IS A 
DEFINING MOMENT 
IN BRITISH POLITICS 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
NOW HAS ANY 
TALK ABOUT FAIR 
FAIRNESS IN BRITISH SOCIETY NOW 
THEY ARE ABANDONING 
OVER FIVE MILLION 
OF THE 
POOREST PEOPLE WHY FOR 
CHEAP POLITICAL

WELL BUSINESS SECT 
JOHN HUTTON HAS

JOHN HUTTON HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART 
BROWN HE 
NOW 
WELCOME WELCOME GOOD MORNING 
LET'S START 
IMMEDIATELY ON THAT TAX QUESTION A 
NOT JUST 
LIB DEMS 
BUT MANY 
MEMBERS OF 
YOUR OWN PARTY 
LOOK AT THE SINGLE PEOPLE WITH 
LOW 
INCOMES WHO 
GOING TO LOSE MONEY 
AS A RESULT OF 
THIS CHANGE 
THAT 
IS SIMPLY 
UN AIR WELL 
OR THREE UNFAIR THINGS I WOULD 
SAY ABOUT THAT 
ANDREW FIRST 
OF ALL 
IT IS IMPORTANT 
TO 
YOU LOOK AT THE 
BUDGET AS A WHOLE 
BILLION 
OF CUTS 
IN PERSONAL TAXES 
THE CHANCELLOR 
ABLE TO PUT 
TOGETHER 
THAT'S A 
VERY SIGNIFICANT 
PACKAGE AND IT ALLOWED US TO SAY IN 
TRUTH 
LOW ST BASIC 
TAX FOR SEVEN YEARS WHAT 
HAVE TRIED TO DO 
AS PART 
OF THE 
OVER 
OVERALL BALANCED PACKAGE BECAUSE 
IT IS IMPORTANT 
PEOPLE SEE IT 
AS A 
PACKAGE 
IS NOT 
LOSE SIGHT 
OF TWO 
OTHER THINGS FIRSTLY FOR WITH CHILDREN 
INCLUDING LOW 
INCOME 
FAMILIES 
THOSE FAMILIES 
WILL BE 
SIGNIFICANT Y. BETTER OFF 
THE WAY THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM WORKS 
AS WELL 
IMPORTANT THING 
TO 
BEAR IN MIND 
PARTICULARLY FOR 
THOSE ON 
LOW INCOMES YOU HAVE TO 
SEE THIS 
AS I 
SAID AS 
PART OF A 
WIRED PACKAGE 
AND OVER A LONGER TIME 
PERIOD SINCE NINETEEN SEVEN LOW INCOME 
FAMILIES HAVE 
GAINED SIGNIFICANT 
Y. 
FROM TAX CREDITS AND TAX CHANGES THE 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
ABLE TO 
INTRODUCE THEY 
ARE ABOUT 
ZERO A 
WEEK 
BETTER OFF I UNDERSTAND 
IT IS 
A 
BETTER OFF PACKAGE 
YOU 
ARE A 
LOW INCOME 
PERSON A SINGLE PERSON 
GOING TO GET QUITE SEVERE Y. HAMMERED 
FROM TODAY ON THIS TAX CHANGE 
IS LOT 
OF MONEY 
FOR MANY PEOPLE 
THEY 
ARE GOING 
TO LOSE IT AND 
THEY 
DON'T UNDERSTAND PUT ALL THE 
TO ONE HIT WITH GREAT RESPECT 
I WOULD SAY 
HIT 
LOOK 
AT THE 
FIGURES THAT 
THE 
TREASURY CAN PRODUCE 
AT MOST HALF A PER CENT THE I S. 
FIGURES ON 
THIS HAVE ACCEPTED 
LOSSES THE 
PRIME MINISTER 
HAS SORT 
OF SUGGESTED 
HE MIGHT LOOK AGAIN 
THE EFFECTS 
IS THAT 
SOMETHING YOU 
WOULD WELCOME LET ME 
LET ME COME BACK 
TO WHAT 
I WAS TRYING 
TO 
SAY 
WE ARE 
TALK 
THE WORSE 
CASE SCENARIO ABOUT HALF A PERCENT HALF 
PERCENT 
OF NET 
INCOME 
BEING THE SCALE 
OF MAXIMUM 
LOSS 
SOMEONE MIGHT 
HAVE 
OF COURSE 
WE ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE OVER L. L. 
ON LOW AND FIX 
INCOMES PENSION 
WELL 
WHY I SAID 
OVER THE 
LAST TEN 
WE HAVE DONE SIGNIFICANT THINGS IN 
THE FACE OF OPPOSITION 
FROM BOTH 
THE 
LIB DEMS AND 
THE TORIES SO 
THE CASE 
I THINK 
ANDREW THAT OVER 
OVERALL 
DISPUTED THAT 
PEOPLE ON LOW AND FIX 
D. INCOMES 
ARE 
SIGNIFICANT Y. BETTER OFF BECAUSE 
THE PRIORITY AND THE 
THINGS THAT 
HAVE DONE 
TEN 
YEARS TO 
FOCUS ON 
THEIR PARTICLUARLY 
NEEDS 
IS RIGHT 
WE HAVE 
DONE 
SO THEY 
THE ONES THAT LOST OUT UNDER THE 
TORIES 
YOU KNOW SINGLE PEOPLE TORIES HAVEN'T 
A LOT 
CHANGES YOU 
ARE TALK 
N. G. ABOUT 
COME BACK 
THESE 
PEOPLE ON ZERO ZERO A YEAR IF ANYBODY IN 
THE COUNTRY 
HAS TO PAY 
MORE 
SURELY THEY 
ARE AMONG 
THE 
PEOPLE WHO 
SHOULD BE ASKED 
TO PAY 
MORE THERE ARE 
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS MORE AND 
THEY HAVE 
BEEN 
RAISED WITH 
OBVIOUSLY IT IS 
RIGHT 
AND PROPER THAT 
MINISTERS ENGAGE 
IN 
A DEBATE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES ABOUT THIS BUT 
IS IT 
POSSIBLE TO RE OOK AT THIS I 
POSSIBLE 
TO DO THAT 
WE HAVE 
MADE THE 
DECISION ON 
THE BUDGET 
THIS 
PACKAGE OF MEASURES WAS ACTUAL Y. 
VOTED ON AND DEBATED LAST YEAR AS 
WELL SO 
I THINK 
THE 
DO 
ARGUE THE CASE ABOUT WHAT 
LABOUR 
IS DOING 
FOR 
FAMILIES ON 
LOW 
AND FIX 
D. INCOMES 
AS WELL AS OTHER 
FAMILIES TOO 
WE HAVE 
TO THINK 
THE NATIONAL INTEREST TOO 
AS I 
SAID AT THE BEGINNING ANDREW 
THERE'S A 
SIGNIFICANT PACKAGE OF 
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT PACKAGE OF CUTS IN PERSONAL TAXES FOR PEOPLE 
THIS BUDGET UP TO BILLION WORTH 
OF PEOPLE 
S. HARD 
EARNED MONEY 
THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DECIDE 
FORE 
THEY SPEND IT 
THAT 
IS RIGHT 
AND 
PROPER TOO 
ONE 
THE 
FOCUSED ON 
AS 
HAVING A 
HARD TIME 
ARE SO 
ALLED 
AGENCY WORK RS PEOPLE NOT DIRECTLY 
VERY 
CONDITIONS LOW 
AND 
VERY LOW STANDARDS 
OF SERVICE 
AS 
WELL CONDITIONS WHAT 
ARE YOU 
FOR THEM 
I THINK 
THAT 
ON ABUSE WHEN PARLIAMENT 
PASSES LAWS THEY HAVE 
TO BE 
EN 
PASSES LAWS THEY HAVE TO BE ENFORCED 
WE HAVE 
TAKEN MEASURES 
TO 
STRENGTH 
N. THE 
WAY 
ARE THE 
STRENGTHEN THE WAY ARE THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE LAW APPLIES TO AGENCY 
AND 
OFTEN MIGRANT 
WORK RS TOO 
THERE 
SHOULD BE NO 
DISTINCTION ARE 
ARE YOU 
BETTER OWE 
OH WE 
ARE 
PUTTING MORE RE OURCE 
INTO THE 
PUTTING MORE RESOURCES INTO THE NATIONAL MINIMUM 
WAGE 
CHANGES THIS WEEK TO WHAT PEOPLE CAN 
BE 
IN 
ACCOMMODATION AND SO ON BECAUSE THINK 
OF PEOPLE 
BEING 
THERE MIGRANT WORK 
WORKERS I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A 
OF AGENT 
ARGUMENT ABOUT IT MAKE A 
POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TO OUR AND 
TO MAKE SURE THEY 
NOT EXPLOIT 
D. AND 
RIPPED OFF 
BY 
COWBOY EMPLOYERS 
TO DO THAT 
THAT'S WHY 
THE LAW 
BEING STRENGTH 
NED AND 
PUTTING MORE RE OURCES 
INTO THE 
PUTTING MORE RESOURCES INTO THE NATIONAL MINIMUM 
WAGE WHICH 
PARLIAMENT HAS RIGHT Y. DECIDED IS AN IMPORTANT TIER 
IN THE PROTECTION 
GIVE TO VULNERABLE WORK 
RS AND 
IT 
GIVE TO VULNERABLE WORKERS AND IT HAS 
TO BE 
THROUGH 
WEREN'T YOU 
A LITTLE SHOCKED 
WITH 
WEREN'T YOU A LITTLE SHOCKED WITH THAT 
SAYING 
THAT ACTUALLY WHEN IT COMES TO 
PEOPLE WHO 
LIVING HERE FOR 
A LONG TIME 
THOSE GREAT 
WAVES OF 
IMMIGRATION THAT HAVE COME 
COUNTRY OVER THE 
LAST FEW 
YEARS HAVE 
BEEN ALMOST NO ECONOMIC BENEFIT 
WHATEVER WELL 
I THINK 
THAT'S AN 
WHATEVER 
BETWEEN US L. 
ISSUE OF DISPUTE BETWEEN US I DON'T THINK WHAT 
IS IN 
DISPUTE 
SIGNIFICANT IN 
REASE IN THE VALUE 
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF OUR 
ECONOMY THAT 
MIGRANT WORK 
HAVE INTRODUCED UP TO BILLION 
LAST YEAR 
AND I THINK 
THE 
ACCEPTED THAT L. KNOW THE ARGUMENT HAS BECOME COMPLICATED 
BUT OVER 
L. L. 
MIGRANT WORK 
RS MAKE 
A POSITIVE 
CONTRIBUTION 
TO THE 
BRITISH ECONOMY 
THEY COME HERE 
TO WORK 
THERE 
IS A 
DIFFERENT PATTERN THAT 
IS VISIBLE 
NOW THE CURRENT WAVE 
OF MIGRATION 
IS TRANSIENT 
YOU LOOK AT 
ARE DOING 
WHEN YOU SAY TRANSIENT PEOPLE WILL GO BACK THEY 
ARE GOING 
BACK 
WE THINK 
HALF OF THE 
ACCOMPLISH MIGRANT WORK 
RS HAVE 
ACCOMPLISH MIGRANT WORKERS HAVE ALREADY RETURNED 
TO POLAND SO THEY 
ARE MAKING 
A POSITIVE 
CONTRIBUTION 
TO OUR ECONOMY 
I THINK 
WE SHOULD 
IN THAT WAY 
I THINK 
A 
CHOICE IN 
ALL OF THESE 
BETWEEN IMAGINING THAT YOU CAN 
REMAIN A 
SUCCESSFUL ECONOMY 
IN 
WORLD BY 
SUGT YOUR 
FRONTIERS AND 
BECOMING A CLOSED ECONOMY CAN'T IN 
THE MODERN 
WORLD 
SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIES 
WILL BE THE 
OPEN 
ECONOMIES THAT 
ARE WILLING 
TO 
RECEIVE INVESTMENT 
WILLING TO 
WORK 
WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES AND 
OTHER 
COMPANIES ACROSS THE WORLD TO CREATE 
VALUE IN THE 
BRITISH 
AND SKILL OUR WORK 
RS FOR 
THE 
CHALLENGES THAT 
LIE A EAD SO 
A FALSE 
CHOICE THIS 
UP 
THE SHUTTERS THE BRITISH WILL SUFFER IF 
WE DEAL 
FLEXIBLY 
WITH 
THE ISSUE 
MAKE 
SURE PEOPLE 
COMING HERE 
ARE GOING 
TO 
SURE PEOPLE COMING HERE ARE GOING TO ADD 
VALUE TO THE 
BRITISH ECONOMY 
THE NEW 
RULES ABOUT 
THE 
SO ALLED POINTS BASED SYSTEM WILL 
ALLOW US TO DO MAKE SURE PEOPLE BRINGING A NET BENEFIT 
INTO THE 
BRITISH ECONOMY 
THEN I THINK 
CAN MAKE THIS 
A WIN WIN SITUATION 
FOR THE U. K. 
WITHOUT TROTTING THEM 
ALL OUT THE LATEST POLL AGAIN 
ARE DREAD 
UL 
DREADFUL FOR 
LABOUR 
ARE YOU 
NOW IN A TAIL SPIN 
YOU CAN'T COME 
OUT OF I 
AT ALL L. SAY THAT FOR 
ONE 
REASON AT 
THE MOMENT 
THERE'S A 
IF YOU LIKE 
SENSE OF IF YOU LIKE THIS IS A REFERENDUM PEOPLE 
ARE SAYING 
THAT 
LIKE US 
WE HAVE 
TO 
WITH 
NEXT ELECTION 
WILL BE NOT JUST A REFERENDUM 
HAVE TO MAKE IT A CHOICE PEOPLE 
HAVE 
ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVE 
THE REAL ISSUE REALLY 
IF YOU LOOK 
AT THE 
STATE 
PARTIES THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT HAS A 
CLEAR MISSION IT HAS A 
DIRECTION OF 
TRAVEL ABOUT THE LONG TERM 
OF THE 
BRITISH ECONOMY THE MANY NOT 
THE FEW MAKING SURE OUR PUBLIC SERVICE 
QUALITY IF YOU 
ASK THE SAME QUESTION TO PEOPLE TORIES THEY 
WOULD SCRATCH 
THEIR 
HEAD WHAT 
IS THE 
BIG MESSAGE FOR 
DAVID CAMERON 
AND THE 
TORIES 
COMPLETE Y. UN LEAR WHAT 
STAND FOR NOW 
THEIR ECONOMIC 
POLICY 
CHANGES EVERY WEEK 
WHEN IT COMES TO 
WHAT YOU STAND FOR A A SERIES OF MINISTER HAVE BEEN 
SHOOTING THEIR 
MINISTERS HAVE BEEN SHOOTING THEIR MOUTHS OFF APPARENTLY STILL THEIR JOBS WHEN IT COMES 
TO THE 
TEN P. 
RATE 
THERE'S GOING 
TO BE 
A 
ECONOMY ATTACK N. G. IT YOUR OWN DEPUTY 
CHIEF WHIP IN 
THE HOULDZ HAS 
A 
TACKED IT 
SLIGHT 
FEELING THAT 
DISCIPLINE AND GOOD BREAKING DOWN AGAIN 
ACCEPT 
BREAKING DOWN AGAIN I DON'T ACCEPT THAT 
I THINK 
THE 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
IS CLEAR 
AND THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF 
MINISTERS IS CLEAR 
CLEAR OUR JOB 
ARGUE OUR CASE 
FOR WHY 
WE DESERVE 
ANOTHER TERM IN 
GOVERNMENT AND 
IT IS A 
VERY 
CLEAR CHOICE 
WE ARE 
GOVERNING IN 
THE 
NOT 
THE VEST 
VESTED INTEREST 
AND 
WE HAVE 
A CLEAR 
DIRECTION OF 
TRAVEL
