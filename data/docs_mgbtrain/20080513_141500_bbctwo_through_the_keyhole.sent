THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
FASCINATING HOMES OWNED BY FASCINATING PERSONALITIES ARE THE KEYS TO TODAY'S ENTERTAINMENT 
AND THE KEY HOLDER AS ALWAYS IS THE LOVELY LISA SNOWDON 
ARE YOU ONE OF LIFE'S WINNERS OR LOSERS 
ARE YOU AN APPRENTICE TO FORTUNE 
OR IS THERE ENOUGH SUGAR ON THE PIE FOR YOU TO SAY YES 
HERE'S SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER DANCED ON THIN ICE 
BUT ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR THE DRAW 
HOIST THE FLAG SET SAIL NEXT STOP HOLLYWOOD 
THE CLUES ARE ALL THERE 
BUT WHO'S PLAYING THE GAME TODAY 
WELL LISA PLAYING THE GAME TODAY OF COURSE IS OUR PANEL 
AND WHAT A PANEL 
THEY ARE 
SO MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THEM 
BUT THEY'VE NEVER MADE THE CHARGES STICK 
THE POPULAR HOST OF FLOG IT OUR FIRST PANELLIST SAID 
I WAS RECENTLY IN AN AUCTION WHEN A MAN LOST HIS WALLET 
CONTAINING FIVE THOUSAND AND OFFERED A REWARD OF ONE THOUSAND FOR ITS RETURN 
QUICK AS A FLASH THE MAN NEXT TO ME SHOUTED ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
OF COURSE IT'S PAUL MARTIN 
A POPULAR ACTRESS A VERY POPULAR ACTRESS OUR NEXT PANELLIST 
IS WELL REMEMBERED FOR HER ROLE IN THE PRISON DRAMA BAD GIRLS 
YEAH 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR 
THAT MAN IS VERY KEEN ON YOU THANKS DAD 
HE'S VERY KEEN 
AS I WAS JUST SAYING SHE'S WELL REMEMBERED FOR THAT ROLE 
PARTICULARLY BY THE MAN IN THE FOURTH ROW 
AND IN FACT SHE HERSELF DEBRA SAYS IT TOTALLY TOOK OVER MY LIFE 
TO THE EXTENT THAT I STARTED DIGGING A TUNNEL IN MY LIVING ROOM 
YES IT'S FOUR HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY THREE BETTER KNOWN AS DEBRA STEPHENSON 
OUR NEXT PANELLIST IS A STALWART OF B. B. C. BREAKFAST 
WHO APPEARED ON STRICTLY COME DANCING 
HE SAID I WOULD HAVE WON IT TOO 
IF I HADN'T KEPT STOPPING TO HAND OVER TO THE WEATHER GIRL 
IT WAS A MISTAKE BY BILL TURNBULL 
SO LET'S FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GAME 
LISA SNOWDON WILL BE TURNING THE LOCKS AND PUSHING OPEN THE DOORS 
ON TWO FASCINATING PROPERTIES 
FROM THE CLUES SHE OFFERS UP ALL OUR PANEL HAVE TO DO THAT'S ALL 
IS TO GUESS WHO WOULD LIVE IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
NOT ALWAYS A SIMPLE TASK BUT MADE EASIER WITH THE ASSISTANCE 
OF NOT ONLY LISA BUT OUR AUDIENCE HERE IN THE STUDIO 
SO LET'S GO STRAIGHT AWAY TO HOUSE NUMBER ONE AND REMEMBER 
WATCH CLOSELY BECAUSE THE CLUES ARE THERE AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
THERE'S A DEFINITE EAST MEETS WEST SCENARIO IN THIS HOUSE 
AND LOTS OF INSTANT CLUES FOR US 
THESE ARE VERY HARD TO IGNORE 
I CAN TELL YOU THEY'RE FAMILY PORTRAITS 
I LOVE THE EXPRESSION ON THIS LITTLE GIRL'S FACE 
SHE LOOKS SO UPSET BLESS 
WHAT IS THAT EXPRESSION 
LOSE A SHILLING FOUND A PENNY 
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AROUND 
THERE'S A MIXTURE OF STYLES HERE 
THIS ANCIENT CARRIAGE CLOCK FLANKED BY THESE CANDLESTICK HOLDERS 
THE CLOCK HAS STOPPED BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THIS PERSON HAS LOTS OF TIME ON THEIR HANDS 
ON THE CONTRARY THEY'VE BEEN UP AGAINST SOME FEROCIOUS DEADLINES 
TO ME THIS LOOKS LIKE THE ORIGINAL FIREPLACE OF THIS HOUSE 
WITH ITS BEAUTIFUL TILES AND IRON SURROUND 
I CAN NEVER WORK OUT WHY PEOPLE RIP THEM OUT WHEN THEY MAKE SUCH BEAUTIFUL FEATURES 
HOW WONDERFUL THE LILIES LOOK IN THIS HUGE MODERN VASE 
THERE'S THE SENSE OF THE MYSTIC HERE WHICH IS A SURPRISE WITH THE BUDDHA 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS PERSON WAS STRICTLY DOWN TO EARTH 
AND WASN'T MUCH FOR PONDERING THEIR NAVEL 
SITTING HERE ON THESE LOVELY LEATHER SOFAS 
I CAN ALMOST IMAGINE THAT I'M WAITING TO BE CALLED INTO A BOARDROOM FOR A THOROUGH GRILLING 
NOW I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL BEING SO PUNCTUAL 
I CALLED THIS MEETING FOR A REASON 
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION AND THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS LATER 
NO REALLY I FEEL AS IF I'M SITTING AT THE HEAD OF THIS TABLE 
LIKE A CORPORATE TYCOON AND THE ONLY THING ON THE AGENDA 
IS BIG BUSINESS AND HUGE DEALS 
IT'S A NICE CUP OF TEA BUT THERE'S TOO MUCH SUGAR IN IT 
LOOK AT THIS HOW FULL IS YOUR BUCKET 
WHAT KIND OF TITLE IS THAT 
IT'S ABOUT POSITIVE STRATEGIES FOR WORK AND LIFE 
I DON'T KNOW HOW FULL MY BUCKET IS BUT IT'S DEFINITELY GOT A HOLE IN IT 
THERE'S A NICE COLOURFUL TOME OF SAVING PLANET EARTH HERE 
I HAVE NOTICED THE ODD TURTLE KICKING ABOUT 
SO PERHAPS NOT AN ECO WARRIOR BUT SOMEBODY WHO'S DEFINITELY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE PLANET 
NOW YOU'RE EXPECTING ME TO SAY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT THIS PERSON LIKES TO COOK 
WELL THEY DON'T BECAUSE THEY GET INVITED TO WINDSOR CASTLE FOR DINNER 
WITH THE PRINCE OF WALES 
THAT'S JUST SHOWING OFF 
BUT I PRESUME THEY DO COOK SOMETIMES SO WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE 
COOL FOOD TO KEEP A COOL HEAD 
THE GREAT FOOD GAMBLE 
AND RICE SPICE AND ALL THINGS NICE 
IF THEY'RE NOT CLUES THEN NOTHING IS 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN 
THE EASTERN INFLUENCE 
THE BOOK ON POSITIVE STRATEGIES AND THE FEROCIOUS DEADLINES 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LISA 
NOW FOR OUR STUDIO AUDIENCE OUR HOME AUDIENCE 
BUT NOT FOR OUR PANEL 
HERE'S WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
NOW WE'RE CONFIDENT OF YOUR LEADERSHIP HERE PAUL 
OH DEAR HA HA 
CRIKEY 
SOMEONE WITH A. 
BATTLING DEADLINES SOMEONE THAT WORKS VERY VERY HARD 
TO A COMMITMENT AND HAS TO MAKE THOSE COMMITMENTS IT'S A FEMALE 
IS SHE A T. V. PRESENTER 
ERM A COUPLE OF CLAPS 
SHE'S ON TELEVISION 
PARDON IS SHE ON TELEVISION YES THAT'S RIGHT 
PUT IT THAT WAY YES SHE IS ON TELEVISION AND SOMETIMES 
SHE PRESENTS AND SO ON AND SOMETIMES SHE CONTRIBUTES O. K. 
OVER TO YOU DEBRA 
DEBRA 
THERE WAS SOME KIND OF HINT ABOUT SUGAR 
I WONDERED IF SHE WORKS WITH ALAN SUGAR 
WELL SPOTTED WELL SPOTTED 
SOMEBODY YOUNG FEMALE 
WHO BELIEVES THEY'RE LEARNING VERY QUICKLY WITH 
A LOT TO LEARN POSSIBLY THEY'VE BEEN AN APPRENTICE OF SOME KIND 
THERE IS AN ASSOCIATION 
WITH SUGAR AND THE APPRENTICE 
BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE APPRENTICE 
POSSIBLY JUST HAVING BEEN A CONTESTANT ON THE APPRENTICE 
FROM THE SIZE OF THE HOUSE I RECKON SHE IS QUITE YOUNG 
STILL SINGLE NOT A FAMILY PERSON 
NO SHE'S MARRIED HAPPILY MARRIED 
HAPPILY MARRIED GOOD TO HEAR 
I'M GLAD YOU SET ME STRAIGHT THERE 
BEFORE I WALLOWED ANY FURTHER INTO THAT PARTICULAR MAN TRAP 
I FELT I OWED IT TO YOU 
VERY KIND THANK YOU 
RIGHT 
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY DONE VERY WELL AS A CONTESTANT BILL THERE SAYS RIGHT MEANING 
THAT'S IT IT'S OVER TO YOU PAUL 
I'M LOOKING TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE YOU ARE AREN'T YOU 
I HAVE AN IDEA BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO REMEMBER THERE HAVE BEEN 
SEVERAL SERIES OF THE APPRENTICE IT'S A QUESTION AS TO WHICH ONE SHE WAS IN 
WHAT I'M CONFUSED ABOUT 
NOT CONFUSED SLIGHTLY IS THE OTHER BOOKS 
THE FOOD GAMBLE BOOK 
AND THERE WAS THE OTHER ONE ABOUT BUSINESS STRATEGIES 
I THINK THAT WAS JUST SHOWING US SHE'S IN BUSINESS 
BUSINESS IS A GAMBLE AND THE OTHER BOOK WAS EASTERN 
OR ASIAN COOKING 
I THINK THAT THEY WERE ALL CLUES 
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANY 
I DON'T THINK WE CAN GO OFF ON A TANGENT 
I THINK THIS PERSON WHOEVER IT WAS WAS QUITE SUCCESSFUL 
A PARTICULAR SUCCESS STORY IN THE APPRENTICE 
STILL IS IN BUSINESS 
DOES SHE HAVE NOW A PRODUCT OUT AT ALL 
DO WE KNOW HER BY NAME IN A SHOP OR SOMETHING 
NO NOT TO THAT EXTENT BUT SHE HAS 
GONE INTO BUSINESS SHE'S GONE INTO BUSINESS 
FOR HERSELF 
WAS SHE A CONTESTANT ON THE APPRENTICE SAY 
TWO THREE YEARS AGO YES 
I HAVE ANOTHER I HAVE AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR YOU MY LUD OH RIGHT 
THIS MAY OR WELL IT'S 
IS SHE EXPECTING 
A HAPPY EVENT IN THE NEAR FUTURE YES 
I'M SO GLAD YOU SAID THAT 
I THINK I HAVE THE ANSWER 
WELL I HOPE SO IS IT SAIRA KHAN 
IT IS 
SAIRA KHAN WILL YOU COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
I KNEW YOU'D GET IT 
I KNEW YOU'D GET IT 
AND ANYONE WHO THOUGHT THAT BILL WAS BEING 
AN INACCURATE JOURNALIST 
WHEN HE SUGGESTED THAT YOU MIGHT BE EXPECTING 
AN ADDITION TO YOUR FAMILY NOW KNOWS HE HAS BEEN VINDICATED ONCE MORE 
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR NEW BUSINESS AND THEN COME BACK TO THE HOUSE IN A MOMENT 
YEAH I LAUNCHED A RANGE OF NATURAL SKIN CARE PRODUCTS FOR CHILDREN LAST YEAR 
SO IT'S BEEN GOING FOR A YEAR AND WE'RE IN SOME KEY DISTRIBUTION POINTS 
AROUND THE COUNTRY SO DOING REALLY WELL 
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PASSION THAT I OWN MY OWN BUSINESS AND HAVE 
SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR MY ENTREPRENEURIAL SKILLS I GUESS 
AND THAT HOUSE HAS GOT A LOVELY EAST MEETS WEST 
LOVELY COSMOPOLITAN 
QUALITY TO IT AND THE FAMILY PORTRAITS AND SO ON 
WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OR ITEM IN THAT HOUSE 
APART OBVIOUSLY FROM YOUR HUSBAND AND YOUR FUTURE CHILDREN 
I THINK FOR ME IT'S MY PHOTOGRAPHS AND MY MEMORIES 
I JUST LIKE TO HAVE THIS FEELING OF BEING PART OF A FAMILY 
AND I REALLY DO LIKE MY PORTRAITS 
I'VE BLOWN THEM UP ON CANVAS I DON'T HAVE 
MY FATHER'S NOT AROUND ANY MORE MY GRANDAD'S NOT AROUND 
THEY'RE IN KASHMIR SO IT'S JUST NICE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF 
IN THE BACKGROUND REMINDING ME WHERE I COME FROM WHAT MY ROOTS ARE 
SO THEY'RE IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY IN TERMS OF THE APPRENTICE 
ALTHOUGH YOU DIDN'T WIN THAT CONTEST ALAN SUGAR DID OFFER YOU A JOB 
YEAH AND YOU DID DECIDE YOU WOULDN'T TAKE IT 
AND LOOKING BACK ON IT NOW WAS THAT THE RIGHT DECISION 
ABSOLUTELY 
I MEAN SINCE I LEFT THE APPRENTICE A GOOD FOUR YEARS AGO NOW I'VE HAD THE MOST AMAZING TIME 
I REALLY FELT IT WAS A REAL STEPPING STONE AND A REAL OPPORTUNITY 
I THINK I FOUND 
IT DID GIVE ME IT DID OPEN DOORS BUT I NEEDED TO KNOW THAT I CAN DO IT FOR MYSELF 
I'M NOT A SPRING CHICKEN ANY MORE 
SO THIS WAS A GREAT TIME TO REALLY FULFIL MY OWN DREAMS AND AMBITIONS 
AND EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE YOU KNOW I'VE KIND OF JUST GONE 
OUT THERE AND DONE IT ON MY OWN OFF MY OWN BACK AND THAT WAS IMPORTANT 
I NEEDED TO PROVE THAT IN MY LIFE REALLY 
BUT THE APPRENTICE WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE 
AND YOU'VE WRITTEN A SELF HELP BOOK ALONG THE WAY 
THAT'S RIGHT 
PUSH WITH CAPITAL LETTERS P. U. S. H. FOR SUCCESS ABSOLUTELY 
WHAT DOES P. U. S. H. STAND FOR 
THE PUSH IN MY BOOK STANDS FOR BE PROACTIVE 
UNDERSTAND YOURSELF AND OTHERS SELL YOURSELF AND HAVE HIGH STANDARDS 
THEY'RE THE PRINCIPLES THAT I USE AND I'VE USED ALL MY LIFE 
THEY COME FROM MY VALUES AS WELL 
IT WORKS IT WORKS BUY THE BOOK 
AND HOW IS LIFE TODAY IN TERMS OF THE CHANGING WORLD SITUATION 
BEING A BRITISH MUSLIM 
IS IT UNCOMFORTABLE TODAY COMPARED WITH TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO OR NOT 
EM THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION 
I THINK FOR ME AS A BRITISH MUSLIM LIFE IS FANTASTIC 
I KNOW THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES OUT THERE 
BUT FOR ME I WANT TO GO OUT THERE AND SAY 
TO YOUNG BRITISH MUSLIMS YOU ARE SO FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY 
YOU KNOW I'VE TRAVELLED AROUND THE WORLD I'VE SEEN HOW OTHER PEOPLE LIVE 
I'VE SEEN HOW PEOPLE LIVE IN EUROPE AS MUSLIMS 
IF YOU LIVE IN BRITAIN YOU ARE THE MOST FORTUNATE PEOPLE 
I REALLY WANT TO GO OUT AND PROMOTE THAT 
FOR ME AND MY FAMILY BRITAIN HAS GIVEN US ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES 
THAT I THINK WE WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD IF WE HADN'T COME TO THIS COUNTRY 
SO FOR ME I FEEL LIKE I'M AN AMBASSADOR I WANT TO GO OUT THERE 
I'M NOT SCARED TO SAY I'M A MUSLIM 
I'M VERY PROUD OF MY HERITAGE I'M PROUD OF THE VALUES I HAVE 
BUT I'M ALSO PROUD TO BE BRITISH 
I THINK THE TWO CAN GO HAND IN HAND 
AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD REALLY FEEL PROUD OF THAT 
AND YOUR TELEVISION JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY BACK TO PAKISTAN 
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN RELIVING YOUR FAMILY AND EVERYTHING 
WHEN THE B. B. C. ASKED ME TO DO THAT IT WAS A DREAM COME TRUE 
MY FATHER IS NO LONGER HERE HE'S BURIED IN KASHMIR 
AND I REMEMBER AS A YOUNG GIRL HE USED TO TELL US AMAZING STORIES YOU KNOW 
THEY COME FROM KASHMIR IN THE HIMALAYAS AND HE USED TO TALK ABOUT 
HE'D GO TO SCHOOL AND THERE'D BE A BIG SNAKE AND TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF PAKISTAN 
AND FOR ME TO GO BACK AND EXPLORE THAT FOR MYSELF 
BUT ALSO FROM A KIND OF A BRITISH POINT OF VIEW YOU KNOW 
JUST BECAUSE MY PARENTS ARE ASIAN DOESN'T MEAN THAT I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT PAKISTAN 
IT WAS A REAL DISCOVERY FOR ME 
AND IT IS AN AMAZING COUNTRY 
IT DOES GET BAD PRESS 
BUT IT IS AN AMAZING COUNTRY 
THE PEOPLE ARE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
GREAT CURRIES AS WELL FANTASTIC FOOD 
SO IT WAS AN AMAZING STO IT WAS AN AMAZING JOURNEY 
BUT ONE THAT I FEEL SO PRIVILEGED TO HAVE DONE 
I REALLY ENJOYED IT FANTASTIC 
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US THANK YOU IT'S INSPIRING TO HAVE YOU WITH US 
THIS IS THE KEY THAT SAYS THANKS A MILLION FOR BEING WITH US 
THANKS A MILLION FOR BEING WITH US THANK YOU 
SAIRA LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SAIRA KHAN 
DO I GET TO KEEP THAT 
YOU GET TO KEEP IT 
SAIRA KHAN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
AND NOW LET'S JOIN LISA AT HOUSE NUMBER TWO 
AND REMEMBER WATCH CLOSELY THE CLUES ARE THERE 
AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
ISN'T THIS NICE 
O. K. IT'S A LITTLE BIT CHILLY 
BUT I IMAGINE ON A SUNNY SUMMER'S DAY THIS WOULD BE THE PERFECT PLACE TO SIT AND RELAX 
IT'S ALWAYS SO AMAZING TO FIND SPACE LIKE THIS IN LONDON WHICH IS WHERE I AM 
CHISWICK TO BE PRECISE 
WHICH IS VERY HANDY FOR HEATHROW 
THIS IS A BRAND NEW HOUSE FOR THIS PERSON WELL HERE IN LONDON ANYWAY 
AND EVERYTHING IS BRAND SPANKING NEW 
THE WALLS ARE SPARKLING WHITE THE KITCHEN HASN'T BEEN COOKED IN 
AND EVERYTHING HAS BEEN PROFESSIONALLY FINISHED 
AND THERE'S NOT A HINT OF ANYTHING BEING HELD TOGETHER 
WITH STICKY BACK PLASTIC 
YUM THIS IS A DELIGHTFUL PIECE OF BANANA CAKE 
MAYBE IT'S A WELCOMING GIFT FROM A NEIGHBOUR 
OR MAYBE IT'S ONE THEY MADE EARLIER 
IF YOU WON THE LOTTERY WHAT KIND OF HOUSE WOULD YOU BUY 
WELL YOU COULD BUY TWO ONE IN NEW YORK SAY A NICE APARTMENT 
AND THIS WOULD DO NICELY IN LONDON 
THERE IS DEFINITELY A SENSE OF MOVING IN 
BUT THEY'VE MOVED THEIR BOOKS IN 
THIS IS SOMEONE WITH A REAL INTEREST IN PEOPLE 
BIOGRAPHIES AND AUTOBIOGRAPHIES FILL THE SHELVES 
EVERYTHING FROM BOB MONKHOUSE TO PIAF TO SUPERMAN 
AKA CHRISTOPHER REEVE 
HERE'S A MATINEE IDOL TUGGED AT A FEW HEART STRINGS DAVID NIVEN 
NOW I'VE BEEN RELIABLY INFORMED 
THAT MR. NIVEN WAS THE CATALYST FOR THIS PERSON'S CURRENT CAREER 
I KNOW I'VE MENTIONED NEW YORK BEFORE 
BUT LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AT THESE FURNISHINGS 
THEY WOULD SIT QUITE COMFORTABLY IN AN OLD MANHATTAN BROWNSTONE 
WHEN I SIT HERE I ALMOST FEEL LIKE I'M ON THE SET OF A CHAT SHOW 
OR I COULD BE LAID BACK RELAXED TALKING ABOUT 
ACTORS AND MOVIES AND WHO'S WHO AND WHO IS DOING WHAT TO WHO 
I COULD BE A T. V. PHENOMENON 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN 
HERE'S ONE THEY MADE EARLIER 
SMILE IT'S ONLY TELEVISION 
AND THE NEW YORK STYLE 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
THANK YOU LISA 
AND NOW FOR OUR HOME AND STUDIO AUDIENCE HERE'S WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
BILL IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I WATCHED CHILDREN'S TELEVISION 
BUT I CAN'T HELP FEELING 
ALL THE THINGS THAT WE MADE WITH STICKY BACKED PLASTIC OVER THE YEARS 
SO THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A BLUE PETER CONNECTION 
THAT'S TRUE DEBRA 
WELL THIS PERSON OBVIOUSLY DOES A LOT OF FLYING 
BECAUSE IT WAS MENTIONED THEY LIVE NEAR THE AIRPORT 
AND THERE'S A LOT OF MENTION OF NEW YORK 
SO IT SEEMS AS IF HE HAS ANOTHER HOME IN NEW YORK AND THAT IT IS A HE 
YEAH IT'S AN EX BLUE PETER PRESENTER 
NOT A CURRENT ONE IT'S AN EX 
SOMEONE THAT'S DONE IT FOR A FAIR BIT OF TIME COS THEY'VE EARNED QUITE A BIT OF MONEY 
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF PROCESS OF DEDUCTION REALLY ISN'T IT 
IF THEY BOUGHT A BROWNSTONE PLACE IN NEW YORK THEN YOU'RE RIGHT 
ABOUT THE MONEY BUT ALSO THEY'RE PROBABLY WORKING IN NEW YORK AS WELL 
REALLY INTERESTING BOOKS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT HOLLYWOOD ACTORS 
AND PARTICULARLY THE DAVID NIVEN CONNECTION I'M FOXED BY THAT IN A SENSE 
I DON'T GET THE FEELING THAT THIS PERSON IS NOW AN ACTOR 
BUT THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING IN NEW YORK AND NEW YORK AS YOU KNOW IS A BIG TELEVISION CENTRE 
SO THEY'RE ON AMERICAN T. V. ARE THEY 
YES YES HE DOES SOME AMERICAN T. V. 
DOES HE ALSO WORK ON STAGE 
HAS HE BEEN IN THE WEST END 
I DON'T KNOW THAT HE HAS 
I THINK THAT THE ACTING PART OF HIS LIFE GOT OVERTAKEN BY THE TELEVISION PART OF HIS LIFE I THINK 
HE MAY HAVE ANOTHER VIEW ON THAT 
THERE IS THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO I'M THINKING OF 
FROM JUST A BIT LATER THAN MY ERA OF BLUE PETER 
WHO I KNOW WORKS IN THE STATES 
AND IS AN ACTOR AND A PRESENTER 
THIS SOUNDS PERFECT I'M THINKING 
THERE'S TWO POSSIBLES BUT THIS ONE'S TIM VINCENT 
WELL DONE 
TIM VINCENT IT IS 
AND SO TIM VINCENT WILL YOU COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
HELLO 
WELL THE DEBRA DID A GREAT JOB THERE ZOOMING IN 
ABSOLUTELY 
IT COULD BE ONE OF TWO PEOPLE SHE SAID WHO WAS THE OTHER 
WELL THE ONLY OTHER PERSON I COULD THINK OF WHO WAS 
AN ACTOR AS WELL AS A BLUE PETER PRESENTER WAS PETER DUNCAN 
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S ACTING NOW 
A VERY GOOD GUESS THOUGH BUT HE IS AN ACTOR AS WELL YES 
AND HOW MANY YEARS WERE YOU ON BLUE PETER 
I ONLY DID BLUE PETER FOR THREE YEARS BUT I THINK I DID IT WHEN IT WAS IN THE FORMATIVE YEARS 
IT WAS AT THE TIME OF ANTHEA TURNER AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT 
IT WAS BEFORE CHANNEL FIVE WAS EVEN INVENTED 
BEFORE EVEN THAT EVEN BEFORE THAT STONE AGE 
WE WERE MUSING AS YOU HEARD 
ABOUT WHETHER ALL OF THE PRESENTING AND THE STUFF ON TELEVISION 
HAS OVERWHELMED YOUR ACTING OR WHETHER YOU STILL WANT TO DO BOTH 
I DID ACT FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS I DID EMMERDALE FOR A YEAR AND A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS 
THEN I TOURED FOR ALMOST A YEAR IN A STAGE PLAY BOUNCERS 
THEN I GOT OFFERED THE JOB IN AMERICA FOR THREE YEARS 
SO I'VE HAD TO TURN EVERYTHING DOWN SINCE 
BUT NO I DO DO IT 
BUT SOMEBODY DESCRIBED ME AS THE SWISS ARMY KNIFE OF PRESENTERS 
YOU DO A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING I THINK IT MUDDIES THE WATER 
AT THE MOMENT PRESENTING FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS 
AND A BIT OF ICE SKATING 
DID YOU ENJOY THAT NOT AT ALL NO 
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS I REALLY WANTED TO HAVE A GO AT IT 
I KNOW BILL WILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF EMPATHY HERE 
THAT YOU TRY YOUR BEST BUT WE'RE NOT NATURAL MOVERS 
NO A WONDERFUL SENSE OF RHYTHM IS WHAT YOU NEED 
EXACTLY AND A LOVE OF LYCRA 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A LOVE OF LYCRA BUT I DIDN'T 
AND THEN THERE'S THE LOTTERY THAT IS A PART OF YOUR LIFE TOO 
YES ALTHOUGH I'VE BEEN IN THE STATES FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS 
EVERY NOW AND THEN I COME BACK AND I'VE HOSTED A FEW SHOWS 
AND AT THE MOMENT WE ARE DOING THE EUROMILLIONS 
WHICH HAD THE INAUGURAL LAUNCH JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT WAS NINETY FIVE M. ILL ION 
YES WHO ORGANISES THAT 
OVER HERE IT'S CAMELOT BUT IT LINKS UP WITH SEVERAL COUNTRIES EVERYWHERE FROM FRANCE TO 
A CONSORTIUM EXACTLY A CONSORTIUM 
THE THREE YEAR ARRANGEMENT IN THE STATES HOW LONG DOES THAT GO ON 
I'VE DONE THREE YEARS I'M STILL WORKING FOR THE AMERICAN SHOW BACK OVER HERE 
BUT RECENTLY I DID MY OWN SHOW OVER THERE CALLED PHENOMENON WHICH WAS A NEW SHOW 
VERY MUCH LIKE AMERICAN IDOL BUT FOR MAGICIANS 
WE HAD URI GELLER AS ONE OF THE JUDGES 
SO THAT WENT VERY WELL WE'RE JUST SEEING IF THAT'S 
THIS WAS PART OF HIS THING ABOUT FINDING A SUCCESSOR TO URI GELLER 
EXACTLY THAT HE'S TOURING THE WORLD 
FINDING A SUCCESSOR 
HE STARTED IN ISRAEL AND GERMANY BUT NOW HE'S GOT TO THE BIG APPLE 
HE NEARLY GOT INTO A FIGHT ON OUR SHOW THE SHOW THAT I WAS HOSTING WAS A LIVE SHOW 
THERE WAS ONLY ME AS THE HOST THE OTHER CRITIC APART FROM URI IS A GUY CALLED CHRIS ANGEL 
WHO CRITICISED SOMEONE RATHER HARSHLY WHO LAUNCHED THEMSELVES AT THE JUDGE 
AND I HAD TO SEPARATE THEM ON STAGE 
SO IT GOES DOWN IN HISTORY ON AMERICAN TELEVISION 
AS THE ONLY LIVE FIGHT THAT'S BROKEN UP IN PRIMETIME 
WHEN HE GOES AROUND SEARCHING FOR THIS MAGICIAN 
DOES HE USE A STICK LIKE THIS 
WE DID HAVE A PROBLEM AT THE END OF EACH SHOW 
URI WOULD DO A LITTLE THING TO THE AMERICAN AUDIENCE AS A LIVE PIECE 
WORKING OUT A NUMBER THAT YOU WERE THINKING OR SOMETHING 
ONE WEEK HE DID IT WITH PLANETS AROUND HIM AND HE HAD TO GUESS WHICH PLANET YOU WERE THINKING OF AT HOME 
I DID AN IMPROMPTU LINK AT THE END SAYING THANK GOODNESS WE DIDN'T END ON URANUS 
URI IS A GREAT GUY BUT DIDN'T FIND THAT FUNNY AT THE TIME 
NO BUT THAT IS MIND BOGGLING SEEING THOSE SIMPLE THINGS 
THAT HE DOES THAT SEEM TO SHOW THAT HE HAS EXTRA NATURAL POWERS 
ABSOLUTELY THAT'S WHY THE SHOW WAS SUCH A SUCCESS I THINK 
IT'S GREAT THAT HE'S DOING ALL THAT 
I MEAN HE ONCE SAID TO ME 
I'M GOING TO FEED YOU 
A MAJOR CITY SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD 
BEFORE HE DID IT HE WROTE IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND PUT IT ON THE TABLE 
AND THEN HE MADE ME CONCENTRATE 
I SAID MILAN 
NEVER SAID MILAN BEFORE IN MY LIFE REALLY MILAN 
HE POINTED DIDN'T TOUCH IT POINTED AT THE PIECE OF PAPER 
AND I OPENED IT AND IT SAID MILAN 
WOW 
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FIDDLE THAT 
THAT'S WHY I THINK HE HAS SOME SPECIAL POWERS 
NOW I'M DOING THE LOTTERY I SHOULD GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM AGAIN 
YES I WONDER IF HE FEELS THAT WOULD BE LETTING DOWN HIS SPECIAL POWERS 
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN IN THE FUTURE 
MORE TELEVISION RATHER THAN ACTING 
MORE TELEVISION MORE TELEVISION OVER HERE HOPEFULLY 
I'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO THE STATES AT THE END OF THE MONTH 
BUT THEN I'M HOPING TO COME STRAIGHT BACK AGAIN AND CARRY ON 
THE LOTTERY TAKES UP THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US 
GOOD LUCK WITH ALL YOUR VENTURES 
LET'S SEE IF YOU'RE A URI GELLER 
CAN YOU BEND THAT 
I DON'T THINK SO THAT'S SOLID 
I THINK EVEN URI WOULD HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THAT I THINK SO 
ANYWAY THANKS A MILLION TIM FOR BEING WITH US 
OUR THANKS TO TIM VINCENT 
AND OF COURSE TO SAIRA KHAN 
NOT TO MENTION OUR PANEL THERE THEY ARE IN ALL THEIR GLORY 
PAUL MARTIN 
DEBRA STEPHENSON 
BILL TURNBULL 
THANKS TO THEM ALL UNTIL THE NEXT TIME GOODBYE FOR NOW 
THERE'S A MURDER A MYSTERY AND AGATHA CHRISTIE 
THE THRILL IS IN THE CHASE NEVER IN THE CAPTURE 
THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN 
IF ANYONE CAN SOLVE THIS IT'S YOU 
AND IF YOU MISSED THE LAST EPISODE IT'S AVAILABLE NOW ON B. B. C. IPLAYER 
TODAY I'VE GRADUATED TO CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY 
AND WHEN YOU'RE HERE THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET ABOUT PROPERLY IS ON YOUR BIKE
