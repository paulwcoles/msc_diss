IN A FLAT ON A GROTTY MANCHESTER HOUSING ESTATE LIVES MOZ 
DEALING IN DODGY SUBSTANCES AND EVEN DODGIER ACTING IN IDEAL 
JUST CHILL 
HE CAN'T HURT YOU 
AARRGGHH 
OUCH 
I THINK SHE WAS A CAT BURGLAR 
A PREGNANT CAT BURGLAR 
THATCHER'S BLOODY BRITAIN 
SHE'S NOT EVEN PREGNANT 
THAT WAS ME TE A LLY ME TELLY 
WHAT WAS THAT SCOTTISH 
NO I FORGET MY LINES ALL THE TIME I DON'T PRETEND I'M STONED 
I LOOK DOWN THE CAMERA AND SAY QUITE HONESTLY 
I'D RATHER BE SOMEWHERE ELSE 
I'M BAD WITH MY LINES BUT I HAVE THE MOST AMOUNT OF LINES 
I'M IN EVERY SCENE SO I GO HOME WITH A HELL OF A LOT OF DIALOGUE TO LEARN 
THIS FLAT IS NOT HAUNTED 
DON'T NEED A PRIEST ANEXONIS ANEXONISM 
YOU NEED A SPELLING TEACHER SORRY 
AND ONLY OUR JOHNNY COULD MANAGE TO TURN GETTING THE LIMELIGHT INTO AN OUTTAKE 
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S ALL FINISHED YEAH AAHHH 
LOOK HOW BALD LOOK HOW BALD IS THAT RIGHT YEAH 
IDEAL IS WRITTEN BY GRAHAM DUFF 
WHO APPEARS IN THE SHOW AS MOZ'S FICKLE FRIEND BRIAN 
THAT MEANS HE'S ON HAND TO WATCH AS JOHNNY AND THE REST OF THE CAST 
DO THEIR BEST TO RUIN ALL HIS HARD WORK 
WHAT'S QUITE NICE WITH IT IS COS GRAHAM'S WRITING IS SO ERRATIC 
YOU CAN THROW IN ANYTHING ANYWAY AND IT BARELY SHOWS UP 
I DID ONE SCENE AND ALL I DID WAS STUFF FROM WIZARD OF OZ 
NOBODY'S PULLED US UP ON IT 
COME ON WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING BOUNCING AROUND 
I'VE JUST HAD THREE STITCHES I'M NOT GETTING ON A SPACEHOPPER 
COME ON NICKI 
I CAN'T LIVE 
SORRY 
YOU'RE ON PROBATION I KNOW LISTEN TO THIS 
DID YOU GET THAT ON SOUND 
I'M JUST EMBARRASSED THAT I LAUGHED SO HARD AT A MAN FARTING 
BUT BEHIND THE FACADE OF LOVEABLE JOHNNY VEGAS 
LURKS A PREENING PRIMA DONNA 
THERE'S TIMES WHERE WE'RE ALL HAVING A LAUGH I'LL HAVE A MOOD SWING 
AND I TELL THEM TO SHUT UP OR THEY'RE SACKED 
VALETS SILICON VALETS BUT IT'S VA 
WHAT IS MY LINE THERE THAT IT'S VALETS WITH A T. 
I'VE SAID THIS SO MANY TIMES 
HE WANTS TO SAY VAGINA BUT IT'S VALETS WITH A T. 
THEY ALL KNOW THAT I ACTUALLY HOLD THEIR FATE IN MY HAND LIKE THAT 
AND I COULD CRUSH ANY ONE OF THEM 
NEVER FOUND THE BULLET 
RAY BEING DEAD ABOUT NINE MONTHS 
IN FACT SOME KEEPS DROPPING THINGS BEHIND MY HEAD 
CUT I'M UPSET AS IT IS 
WE'RE A CLOSE KNIT BUNCH 
THEY GO TO ONE PUB I GO OUT ON MY OWN 
I HAVE A LITTLE ROPE AROUND ME 
BUT IT'S GREAT BECAUSE I CAN CHOOSE TO MINGLE WITH THEM WHEN I WANT TO 
AND WHEN I DON'T I TELL THEM TO OFF 
CHARMED I'M SURE 
AND NEXT TIME ON THREE'S OUTTAKES 
ROB BRYDON LETS OFF SOME STEAM IN ANNUALLY RETENTIVE 
COS I'M AN AWARD WINNING ACTOR 
SORRY OH MY GOD 
THOSE BIG HEADED SONTARANS ARE STILL WAGING WAR 
CHANGE OF PLAN 
AND THEY HAVE AN ALMIGHTY CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER 
THEY LOOK BRILLIANT 
A WHOLE NEW DYNAN IC OF CREATURE
