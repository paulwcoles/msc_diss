WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED THEY DIED 
BECAUSE OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE BY THE 
PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO WERE PURSUING 
THEM AND BY THE CHAUFFEUR WHO WAS 
DRIVING RECKLESSLY THERE WERE 
FACTORS THEY WEREN'T WEARING SEAT 
BEMTS BEMTS BELTS BUT HENRI 
PAUL HAD BEEN DRINKING AND THE 
ALCOHOL IMPAIRED HIS JUDGEMENT 
MO HOE MOHAMED AL FAYED ALWAYS 
CLAIMED DIANA AND DODI WERE 
MURDERED BY THE ROYAL FAMILY 
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT PRINCE 
PHILIP AND THE QUEEN HOLD EVIDENCE 
THAT ONLY THEY KNOW THEMP NOT 
QUESTIONED THEY WERE NOT 
QUESTIONED BUT SHOULD OF BEEN NO 
ONE SHOULD BE ABOVE THE LAW 
WE WILL BE ASKING WHETHER THE 
VERDICTS WILL PUT AN END TO THE 
CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND WHETHER 
CRIMINAL CHARGES CAN BE BROUGHT 
AGAINST THE PAPARAZZI 
KAREN MATTHEWS THE MOTHER OF NINE 
YEAR OLD SHANNON IS ARRESTED FOR 
ATTEMPT TO GO PERVERT THE COURSE OF 
JUSTICE JUSTICE THE OLYMPIC FLAME GOES OUT AS ANTI 
CHINA PROTESTS STOP THE RELAY IN 
PARIS 
AFTER THE OLYMPIC TORCH PROTESTS 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ORGANISERS SCALE DOWN THEIR 
PLANS AND PARENTS FURY AS CANNABIS 
SWEETS GO ON SALE 
GOOD EVENING 
DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES AND DODI AL 
FAYED WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED A HIGH 
COURT JURY AT THE INQUEST INTO 
THEIR DEATHS BLAMED THE JEJS OF 
THEIR DRIVER HENRI PAUL AND THE 
PAPARAZZI WHO HAD FOLLOWED THEIR 
CAR INTO THE ALMA TUNNEL IN PARIS 
THE JURY SAID HENRI PAUL HAD BEEN 
DRINKING AND WAS DRIVING AT TWICE 
THE SPEED LIMIT BUT THEY BLAMED 
THE PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO WERE RACING 
BEHIND THEIR CAR 
NICHOLAS WITCHELL JOINS US NOW FROM 
THE HIGH COURT 
WELL THESE ARE SENSATIONAL 
VERDICTS DIANA AND DODI WERE 
UNLAWFULLY KILLED BUT NOT AS 
MOHAMED AL FAYED HAS BEEN SAYING 
FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS BY A 
CONSPIRACY INVOLVING THE BRITISH 
ESTABLISHMENT THEY WERE UNLAWFULLY 
KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT UNLAWFULLY 
KILLED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND 
THE RECKLESSNESS OF THEIR DRIVER 
HENRI PAUL AND THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN RATSY 
PAPARAZZI WHO WERE PURSUING THEM 
THAT WAS THE FINDING OF A MAJORITY 
OF THE JURY WHICH SPENT THE LAST 
SIX MONTHS HERE AT THE ROYAL COURTS 
OF JUSTICE IN THIS EXHAUSTIVE EPIC 
ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENCE 
SO NOW FINALLY WE HAVE A VERDICT 
DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES WHO IN 
LIFE WAS THE FOCUS OF INTERNATIONAL 
FASCINATION AND WHO IN DEATH HAS 
BEEN AT THE CENTRE OF SPECULATION 
ABOUT AN ALLEGED MURDER CONSPIRACY 
WAS UNLAWFULLY KILLED BY THE 
RECKLESSNESS OF HER DRIVER HENRI 
PAUL AND OF THE PACK OF 
PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO WERE PURSUING HER 
TRYING TO GET A PICTURE 
THE JURY OF ELEVEN SLENGTED 
MEMBERS SELECTED MEMBERS OF THE 
PUBLIC WHO LAST OCTOBER WERE TAKEN 
TO PARIS TO SEE THE KILOICATIONS 
FOR THEMSELVES AND WHO HAVE HEARD 
EVIDENCE FROM OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WITNESSES 
HAD SPENT THREE AND A HALF DAYS 
CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICTS BEFORE 
FOUR POINT THREE OH THE JURY FOREWOMAN GOT TO HER 
FEET IN A COURTROOM PACKED WITH 
LAWYERS AND WITH MOHAMED AL FAYED 
AND DIANA'S SISTER LADY SARAH 
MCCORQUODALE BOTH WATCHING 
THE VERDICTS SHE SAID WERE OF 
UNLAWFUL KILLING WITH THE FOLLOWING 
CAUSES OF THE CRASH THE SPEED AND 
DRIVING OF THE CAR THE SPEED AND 
DRIVING OF THE FOLLOWING VEHICLES 
AND THE IMPAIRMENT OF HENRI PAUL 
IT IS THE ROLE OF HENRI PAUL WHICH 
IN MANY WAYS HAS BEEN AT THE CENTRE 
OF INQUEST AND WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTED 
BY THE VERDICTS OF UNLAWFUL KILLING 
THE JURY HEARD EVIDENCE ABOUT HIS 
CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL ON THE 
EVENING OF THE CRASH HE HAD THE 
EQUIVALENT OF FOUR SINGLE WHIS KEYS 
IN THE HOTEL BAR HE DROVE THE MAR 
SED YESES AT EXCESSIVE SPEED 
PURSUED BY PHOTOGRAPHERS NONE OF 
THEM WOULD TESTIFY 
THE JURY DECIDED THEY DESERVED THE 
FINDING UNLAWFUL KILLING 
LORD STEPHEN WHO LED THE THREE YEAR 
BRITISH INQUIRY GAVE HIS REACTION 
TO THE VERDICTS 
I JUST HOPE THAT THIS CAN BRING 
CLOSURE TO WHAT HAS BEEN A 
TRAUMATIC EVENT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 
MR. AL FAYED HAS SAID THAT HE WILL 
ACCEPT THE VERDICTS OF THE JURY 
THE VERDICT HAS BEEN CLEAR THEY 
HAVE SAID THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE 
THAT THERE IS NO CONSPIRACY IN 
RELATION TO THIS MATTER 
MOHAMED AL FAYED'S CENTRAL 
ALLEGATION OF COURSE WAS THAT THE 
SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE HAD 
MURDERED THE COUPLE 
THE CORONER RULED THAT WASN'T 
EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE CLAIM 
THAT IT WAS THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH 
WHO MASTERMINDED THE MURDER OF HER 
DAUGHTER IN LAW DAUGHTER IN LAW ONE FORMER SENIOR INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICIAL SAYS THE ALFAYED 
ALLEGATIONS WERE ABSURD 
IT WAS CENTRAL ALLEGATION THAT 
PRINCE PHILIP CONSPIRED WITH M. I SIX TO 
MURDER THE PRINCESS WAS 
PREPOSTEROUS IT WAS ALWAYS 
PREPOSTEROUS PREPOSTEROUS THOSE CLOSE TO DIANA HOPE MOHAMED 
AL FAYED WILL LET THINGS REST 
I JUST HOPE NOW THAT HE WILL FIND 
SOME SORT OF PEACE AND STOP 
PURSUING THIS LINE OF INQUIRY THIS 
WHOLE CIRCUS THAT HE HAS KEPT ON 
THE ROAD FOR TEN YEARS NOW 
I MEAN I THINK HE NEEDS TO ALLOW 
DIANA AND HIS SON SOME DIGNITY NOW 
IN THEIR DEATH AND LET LET THEM 
REST REST TONIGHT MR. AL FAYED'S SPOKESWOMAN 
RETURNED TO HIS CLAIM THAT IT WAS 
MURDER MURDER I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO SAYS 
THEY WERE MURDERED DIANA PREDICTED 
SHE WOULD BE MURDERED AND HOW IT 
WOULD HAPPEN SO I AM DISAPPOINTED 
THE VERDICTS WILL COME AS A BLOW TO 
THE MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND 
THE WORLD WHO SUPPORTED MY STRUGGLE 
AND I THANK THEM 
MR. ALFAYED LEFT THE HIGH COURT 
WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING WHETHER HE 
WILL NOW DO AS HE SAID HE WOULD ON 
OATH IN THE WITNESS BOX AND ACCEPT 
THE VERDICTS REMAINS TO BE SEEN 
JUST THIS EVENING DESPITE THE 
VERDICTS OF UNLAWFUL KILLING CAUSED 
BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF HENRI 
PAUL AND THE FOLLOWING VEHICLES OF 
THE PAPARAZZI IT SEEMS UNLIKELY AT 
THE MOMENT THAT MOHAMED AL FAYED IS 
GOING TO ABANDON HIS CLAIMS OF A 
CONSPIRACY HIS SPOKESWOMAN SAID 
THAT IN IDENTIFYING THE FOLLOWING 
VEHICLES AS PART OF THE VERDICT 
THIS RA RACES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO 
WAS IN THE VEHICLES WHO WERE THEY 
AND WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN PARIS 
THAT IS STILL A MYSTERY SHE SAID 
WE ARE EXPECTING A STATEMENT FROM 
CLARENCE HOUSE FROM PRINCES 
WILLIAM AND HARRY THEIR WISH WILL 
BE THAT THIS DRAWS A LINE UNDER THE 
SPECULATION UNDER THE CLAIMS OF A 
CONSPIRACY IT WILL ECHO WHAT THE 
BISHOP OF LONDON SAID AT THE 
MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR THE PRINCESS 
LAST AUGUST YOU REMEMBER THAT HE 
SAID LET IT END HERE THAT WILL 
BE VERY MUCH THE WISH OF OF MEMBERS 
OF DIANA'S FAMILY AND HER FRIENDS 
THE VERDICTS RAISE THE QUESTION AS 
TOO WHETHER ANY PROCEEDINGS COULD 
BE BROUGHT AGAINST THE PAPARAZZI 
THE VERDICTS OF UNLAWFUL KILLING BY 
THE MEANS OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE 
OF THE FOLLOWING VEHICLES IN 
ESSENCE IS A CLAIM OF MANSLAUGHTER 
AGAINST THEM BUT NO INDIVIDUALS 
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED NONE OF THEM 
CAME HERE TO TO TESTIFY IT MUST BE 
VERY VERY UNLIKELY THAT THE 
VERDICTS CAN BE FOLLOWED BY ANY 
PROSECUTIONS 
AS HE SAID AFTER SIX MONTHS 
HUNDREDS OF WITNESSES AND AT A COST 
OF APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION HOW 
MUCH MORE DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED ON THE NIGHT OF THE THIRTY FIRST 
AUGUST NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN HERE IS CLIVE MYRIE 
PARIS ON A BARMY SUMMER'S EVENING 
A SMILING PRINCESS DIANA AND DODI 
AL FAYED IN THE AFTERNOON OF AUGUST 
THIRTIETH NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
THEY WERE HOPING LONGING FOR 
PRIVACY PRIVACY WHEREVER THEY WENT THE PAPARAZZI 
FOLLOWED REMEMBER PICTURES OF 
PRINCESS DIANA AND DODI AL FAYED 
TOGETHER WERE WORTH A SMALL FORTUNE 
PHOTOGRAPHERS DOGGED THEIR EVERY 
MOVE IN PARIS FORCING THE COUPLE 
TO ABANDON PLANS TO DINE OUT AT ONE 
RESTAURANT RESTAURANT SO THEY ENDED UP RETREATING BACK 
HERE TO THE RITZ 
STAFF AT THE RITZ HADN'T PLANNED ON 
THEIR RETURN AND WERE IN A PANIC 
THE DEPUTY HEAD OF SECURITY HENRI 
PAUL HAD TO BE CALLED BACK IN HE 
HAD BEEN OFF DUTY FOR THREE HOURS 
HE SEEMS O. K. AS HE TIES HIS 
SHOELACES BUT DESPITE EARLIER 
DENIALS STAFF ADMITTED AT THE 
INQUEST THAT HENRI PAUL HAD BEEN 
DRINKING DRINKING NO ONE KNOWS HOW MUCH HENRI PAUL 
DRANK THAT NIGHT 
BUT THIS RITZ BAR BILL PROVES HE 
DRANK AT LEAST TWO MEASURES OF 
SPIRIT THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF 
FOUR MEASURES OF WHISKY BLOOD 
TESTS SHOWED HE WAS THREE TIMES 
OVER THE FRENCH DRINK LIMIT AND 
TWICE THAT OF THE U. K. AND SHOULD 
NEVER OF BEEN BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A 
CAR THAT WASN'T ALL ONE AUTOPSY 
SHOWED HIS BLOOD CONTAINED A DRUG 
USED TO TREAT ALCOHOLICS ALONG WITH 
THE ANTI DEPRESSANT PROZAC 
INEVITABLY EVEN IF YOU APPEAR TO 
BE FUNCTIONING NORMALLY BECAUSE YOU 
HAVE GOT ALCOHOL ON BOARD AND YOU 
DEVELOPED A DEGREE OF TOLERANCE TO 
THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL WHEN 
SOMETHING UNUSUAL HAPPENS WHICH 
REQUIRES A RAPID DECISION AND RAPID 
REACTIONS TO THAT CHANGING 
SITUATION YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO 
COPE WITH IT 
DODI DECIDES TO TAKE DIANA HIS 
APARTMENT APARTMENT HE AND HENRI PAUL HATCH A PLAN TO 
SHAKE OFF THE PAPARAZZI GROWING 
WRESTLESS OUTSIDE 
BODYGUARDS TREVOR REES AND ANOTHER 
BODYGUARD ARE TOLD A DECOY CAR WILL 
GO AROUND THE FRONT WHILE DODI AND 
DIANA ESCAPE OUT THE BACK 
THE BODYGUARDS TOLD THE JURY THEY 
WERE UNHAPPY WITH THE PLAN ONE 
BODYGUARD SAID DODI TOLD HIM IT 
HAD HAD BEEN OKED BY MF 
M. IS MOHAMED AL FAYED MF 
MOHAMED AL FAYED 
THE RANKS HAD BEEN WAITING FOR 
PICTURES PICTURES AMONG THEM THIS MAN ON THE BIKE A 
DISPATCH RIDER WORKING WITH A 
PHOTOGRAPHER PHOTOGRAPHER THE PLAN WAS FOR HENRI PAUL TO 
DRIVE DIANA AND DODI YOU CAN SEE 
HIM AT THE BACK OF THE RITZ 
ACKNOWLEDGING THE PRESENCE OF 
PHOTOGRAPHERS WITH A WAVE SOME 
SAID HE WAS VERY CHATTY AND 
APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN DRINKING 
AND THEY TAKE THESE PICTURES THE 
LAST OF DIANA ALIVE 
THE JURY WAS TOLD THIS WAS TAKEN AS 
THEIR CAR LEFT THE RITZ AND NOT 
LATER IN THE TUNNEL AS PREVIOUSLY 
THOUGHT THOUGHT AT THE TOP OF THIS PICTURE YOU CAN 
SEE HENRI PAUL'S MERCEDES PULLING 
AWAY FOLLOWED BY THE PAPARAZZI THE 
COURT HEARD HIS LAST WORDS TO THEM 
WERE DON'T TRY TO FOLLOW US YOU 
WON'T BE ABLE TO CATCH UP INSTEAD 
OF TAKING THE DIRECT ROUTE TO 
DODI'S APARTMENT HENRI PAUL TRIES 
TO OUTRUN THE PURSUING 
PHOTOGRAPHERS FOUR MINUTES LATER 
THE MERCEDES APPROACHES THE ALMA 
TUNNEL TRAVELLING AT TWICE THE 
SPEED LIMIT AROUND SIXTY TO SIXTY FIVE M. P. H. 
THE MERCEDES CLIPS A WHITE CAR IT 
WAS NO MORE THAN A GLANCING BLOW 
BEFORE VEERING TO THE LEFT RIGHT 
THEN LEFT AGAIN AND SMASHING INTO 
THE THIRTEENTH PILLAR OF THE TUNNEL THE 
FIAT DIDN'T STOP A POLICE CAR 
EXPERT RULED OUT THE FIAT AS A 
CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT AND TWO 
EYEWITNESSES WHO DESCRIBED SEEING A 
FLASH OF LIGHT IN THE TUNNEL WERE 
DEEMED UNRELIABLE MORE IMPORTANT 
WAS HENRI PAUL'S OVERZEALOUS 
STEERING HIS UNFAMILIAR YART WITH 
THE CAR AND HIS SPEED 
THIS PIKE TURE WAS TAKEN MOMENTS 
AFTER THE CRASH BY THE PHOTOGRAPHER 
THE DOORS OF THE MERCEDES ARE STILL 
CLOSED EVENTUALLY THE PAPARAZZI 
DID OPEN THE DOORS THEY POINTED 
THEIR LENS INTO THE VEHICLE IN 
COURT THIS THIS MAN CLAIMED HE 
TRIED TO KEEP THE PHOTOGRAPHERS 
AWAY AN ALLEGATION WAS MADE THAT 
MR. RA TRIED TO SELL PICTURES FROM 
THE TUNNEL TO THE SUN NEWSPAPER 
SPEAKING TO THE B. B. C. AFTER THE CRASH 
HE ADMITTED HE DIDN'T CALL FOR HELP 
NINE PHOTOGRAPHERS ALONG WITH THE 
DISPATCH RIDER WERE ARRESTED BY 
FRENCH POLICE 
THEY WERE CHARGED WITH MANSLAUGHTER 
AND FAILING TO ASSIST PEOPLE IN 
DANGER BUT WERE NEVER PROSECUTED 
ONLY STEFAN AGREED TO TESTIFY AT 
THE INQUEST THE OTHERS REFUSED 
PRINCESS DIANA WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD 
AT FOUR HUNDRED A M. ON THE MORNING OF AUGUST 
THIRTY FIRST NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
LET'S RETURN TO THE HIGH COURT AND 
JOIN NICHOLAS WITCHELL 
YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS 
INQUEST FROM THE START WHAT IN 
YOUR VIEW IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 
THE VERDICTS OF UNLAWFUL KILLING 
THIS JURY HAS BEEN VERY PAIN 
STAKING IN THE WAY THEY HAVE 
CONSIDERED THE MASS OF EVIDENCE WE 
HAVE HEARD OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS 
THEY COULD HAVE GONE FOR THE SAFE 
VERDICT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN 
ACCIDENTAL DEATH THEY COULD HAVE 
CITED THE MANNER OF THE DRIVING OF 
HENRI PAUL AND THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE 
PAP RTSY LORD JUSTICE SCOTT BAKER 
EXPLAINED TO THEM BEFORE THEY 
RETURNED VERDICTS OF UNLAWFUL 
KILLING THEY HAD TO BE CERTAIN TO A 
LEVEL OF CRIMINAL CERTAINTY BEYOND 
ALL REASONABLE DOUBTS THAT THE 
NEGLIGENCE WAS GROSS NEGLIGENCE 
EQUIVALENT TO RECKLESSNESS NOW 
AFTER THREE AND A HALF DAYS OF VERY 
CAREFUL CONSIDERATION THE JURY 
CAME BACK BY A MAJORITY OF NINE TO 
TWO AND THEY HAVE CONCLUDED THAT 
IT WAS UNLAWFUL KILLING BY THE 
MANNER OF THE DRIVING OF HENRI PAUL 
THE FACT THAT HE WAS IMPAIRED BY 
ALCOHOL AT THE TIME HE TOOK THE 
WHEEL AND OF COURSE THROUGH THE 
BEHAVIOUR VEHICLES 
BY THAT WE MEAN THE PAPARAZZI WHO 
WERE PURSUING THE MERCEDES WHEN IT 
WAS TRAVELLING AT SUCH EXCESSIVE 
SPEED SPEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THE VERDICTS 
INTO THE DEATHS OF DIANA AND DODI

ATTEMPTING TO PERVERT THE COURSE OF

DEVELOPMENT IN A FAST MOVING CASE 
SHANNON IS ONE OF HER MOTHER'S

AFTER SHE WAS FOUND QUESTIONS ARE 
STILL BEING ASKED ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED TO SHANNON MATTHEWS 
THE TOP STORY TONIGHT DIANA AND 
DODI WAS UNLAWFULLY KILLED THE 
INQUEST JURY SAY THE PAPARAZZI AND 
THE DRIVER HENRI PAUL WERE BOTH 
TO BLAME COMING UP ELEVEN YEARS ON 
HOW DO THE PUBLIC YOU DIE AND THE 
EVENTS OF THAT NIGHT FEW DIANA 
AND THE EVENTS OF THAT NIGHT 
THE FIRST EVER INTERNET T. V. HUSTINGS 
HOW YOU CAN PUT QUESTIONS TO THE 
MAYOR CANDIDATES 
AND THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE FILM 
THAT TOOK FIVE YEARS TO MAKE AT A 
COST OF JUST FEW HUNDRED POUNDS 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY MOVED TO 
PARIS TODAY AND HAD TO BE CUT SHORT 
AFTER YET MORE DEMONSTRATIONS FROM 
ANTI CHINESE PROTESTERS AFTER THE 
CHAOS IN LONDON TODAY CLASHES ALSO 
BROKE OUT WITH POLICE IN PARIS 
LEADING TO NEARLY THIRTY ARRESTS THE 
TALK WAS CARRIED ON THE LAST PART 
OF ITS JOURNEY BY BUS AT THE 
REQUEST OF THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES 
FROM PARIS DOMINIC HUGHES 
THIS WAS NOT HOW IT WAS MEANT TO BE 
BLOODY GOOD PRO TIBET DEMONSTRATORS 
ON THE STREETS OF PARIS BLOODY 
PROTESTERS A MASSIVE POLICE 
OPERATION THREE THOUSAND POLICE OFFICERS 
FAILED TO STOP THE TORCH RELAY 
DESCENDING INTO FARCE BARELY 
VISIBLE AT THE BEST OF TIMES 
BECAUSE OF HEAVY SECURITY ON THREE 
OCCASIONS THE TORCH DISAPPEARED 
ENTIRELY BUNDLED ON BOARD A BUS TO 
AVOID DEMONSTRATORS THIS IS 
EXACTLY WHAT THE ORGANISERS OF THE 
TORCH RELAY DID NOT WANT TO SEE 
TODAY NOISY PROTESTERS ON THE 
STREETS OF PARIS GIVING THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH A HOSTILE RECEPTION 
AND AT THE OFFICIAL DEMONSTRATION 
WELL AWAY FROM THE REALLY RUDE IT 
WAS TIBET NOT THE OLYMPICS THAT 
PEOPLE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT FROM 
THE RELAY ROUTE 
THIS IS ABOUT 
USING THE OCCASION FOR THE PEOPLE 
IN THE WORLD TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING 
ON IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE 
ACCESS 
THE CHINESE ORGANISERS HAD ACCESS THEIR SUPPORTERS ON THE STREET AS 
WELL THE STUDENTS ENTHUSIASTIC 
BACKERS OF THE BEIJING GAMES BUT 
AFTER THE LONDON PROTESTS BLUE 
SUITED CHINESE SECURITY MARSHALS 
FAILED TO STOP IT BEING DISRUPTED 
OLYMPIC OFFICIALS ARE WORRIED WHERE 
THIS WILL END 
WE ARE DEFINITELY 
NOT HAPPY WITH THE PROTEST WE 
RESPECT THE PROTEST THERE'S NO 
DOUBT ABOUT THAT IF THEY PROTEST 
WE RESPECT THEM AS LONG AS THEY 
ARE NOT VIOLENT 
IN THE END THE 
PARIS TORCH RELAY WAS ABANDONED 
BUT THERE ARE MORE THAN TWENTY CITIES 
STILL TO BE VISITED FURTHER 
PROTESTS ARE BOUND TO FOLLOW 
THERE WILL BE NO U. TURN ON THE 
DECISION TO ABOLISH THE TEN PENCE 
STARTING RATE OF INCOME TAX THAT 
WAS THE MESSAGE FROM MINISTERS 
TODAY BUT THE MOVE HAS DIVIDED 
MANY WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY SOME 
M. P.'S ARGUE THAT IT IS LOW PAID 
YOUNG WORKERS WHO EARN LESS THAN 
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WHO WILL BE THE HARDEST HIT 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED NURSES 
AND OTHER N. H. S. WORKERS AN EIGHT PER CENT PAY 
RISE OVER THREE YEARS THEY SAY THE 
NEW DEAL IS THE HIGHEST BEING 
OFFERED IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR OVER 
ONE BILLION STAFF IN ENGLAND WOULD 
RECEIVE AN INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT THIS 
YEAR FOLLOWED BY TWENTY FOUR PER CENT NEXT YEAR 
AND A TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT RISE THE YEAR AFTER 
THAT THAT WE ARE GOING TO TURN OUT TO THE 
INQUEST INTO THE DEATHS OF DIANA 
PRINCESS OF WALES AND DODI AL 
FAYED A JURY HAS RULED THE COUPLE 
WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED THE JURY 
BLAMED NEGLIGENT DRIVING BY HENRI 
PAUL AND BY THE PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE 
PURSUING THE CAR AT THE TIME OF 
HER DEATH THERE WAS A HUGE 
OUTPOURING OF GRIEF ACROSS THE U. K. 
BUT HOW IS SHE VIEWED ELEVEN YEARS ON 
SHE WAS THE PEOPLE'S PRINCESS AND 
THAT'S HOW SHE WILL STAY HOW SHE 
WILL REMAIN 
ABOVE ALL WE GIVE THANKS FOR THE 
LIFE OF A WOMAN I AM SO PROUD TO BE 
ABLE TO CALL MY SISTER 
IT'S MORE THAN A DECADE SINCE THOSE 
EXTRAORDINARY SCENES AT KENSINGTON 
PALACE THERE HAS HARDLY BEEN A DAY 
SINCE THEN WHEN DIANA'S IMAGE HAS 
NOT APPEARED IN THE PAPERS AND WHEN 
THERE HAS NOT BEEN SOME KIND OF 
SPECULATION ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH 
SHE DIED MANY HOPE THAT THIS 
INQUEST WOULD FINALLY DRAW A LINE 
UNDER THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES THE 
QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER THAT WILL 
REALLY HAPPEN IT'S NOW TEN YEARS 
AND SEVEN MONTHS SINCE DIANA AND 
DODI DIED THERE HAVE BEEN TWO 
POLICE INVESTIGATIONS ONE BY THE 
FRENCH AND ONE IN THE U. K. BY LORD 
STEVENS THIS INQUEST A LOAN HEARD 
TWENTY SIX WEEKS OF EVIDENCE ALONE FROM 
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DIFFERENT WITNESSES THE 
COST OF ALL THE INVESTIGATIONS IS 
ESTIMATED TO BE AROUND TEN MILLION 
SO IS THIS THE MOMENT WHEN WE 
FINALLY MOVE ON 
THE BRITISH PUBLIC 
ARE FED UP WITH THE WHOLE THING 
AND I REALLY THINK IT'S TIME NOW TO 
END THE MATTER LET HER REST IN 
PEACE 
FOR THE SAKE OF HER SONS AND PEACE EVERYBODY ELSE IT IS TIME WE MOVED 
ON I AM SURE SHE WOULD WANT US TO 
MOVE ON 
BUT JUST BEFORE THE END OF 
THE INQUEST WHICH QUESTIONED ONE THOUSAND 
PEOPLE FOR A B. B. C. OPINION POLL WE 
QUESTIONED THE LARGE MAJORITY DID 
NOT BELIEVE DIANA WAS MURDERED 
HOWEVER WHEN WE ASKED IF THE 
INQUEST WOULD END SPECULATION SEVENTY EIGHT PER CENT 
SAID NO 
ANY CATASTROPHIC EVENT 
RAISES THE QUESTION WHY DID IT 
HAPPENED PEOPLE TEND TO TRY TO 
SEIZE ON A READY EXPLANATION 
SOMETHING MUST HAVE CAUSED THE 
EVENT PEOPLE TEND TO BE 
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA THAT 
SOMETHING IS JUST RANDOM HAPPENED 
BY CHANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS LOOKING 
FOR SOMETHING THAT CAUSED IT UNTIL 
THEY FEEL THEY HAVE THAT 
EXPLORATION THEY WILL CARRY ON 
SEARCHING 
WELCOME TO MY DIANA ROOM SEARCHING THE RESULTS OF OUR POLL WILL COME 
AS NO SURPRISE TO MARGARET TYLER 
DEVOTED TO DIANA SHE NEVER 
BELIEVED THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES 
BUT SHE DOES THINK THEY ARE BOUND 
TO CONTINUE 
I THINK THEY SHOULD 
HAVE HAD THE INQUEST SOONER L. L. 
DON'T THINK IT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN 
TEN YEARS SHE WAS A MEMBER OF ALL 
OUR FAMILY IT 
NOT SEEM 
OUR FAMILY IT DOES NOT SEEM POSSIBLE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER 
PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD SO MANY 
THEORIES IF IT HAD BEEN PERHAPS 
AFTER TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS 
ACCORDING TO OUR SURVEY MOHAMED AL 
FAYED'S REPUTATION HAS BEEN DAMAGED 
BY THE INQUEST THE VIEW OF FIFTY TWO PER CENT OF 
RESPONDENTS THE FORMER BUTLER 
PAUL BURRELL FARED EVEN WORSE 
WITH SEVENTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE BELIEVING HIS 
REPUTATION HAD BEEN DAMAGED BUT 
DESPITE THE INTIMATE DETAILS OF HER 
PRIVATE LIFE THAT WERE REVEALED IN 
COURT DIANA'S OWN REPUTATION 
APPEARS TO REMAIN INTACT THREE 
QUARTERS OF THE PEOPLE WE SPOKE TO 
SAID THERE VIEW OF HER REMAINED THE 
SAME OR HAD EVEN IMPROVED DURING 
THE INQUEST 
OF COURSE THERE WILL BE MUCH MORE
