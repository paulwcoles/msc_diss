GO GO GO 
WAIT WAIT WAIT D'YOU HAVE A TICKET 
WAIT THOSE PEOPLE ARE GETTING IN WITHOUT TICKETS 
CALAIS IN NORTHERN FRANCE 
REFUGEES COME HERE DESPERATE TO GET INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM 
FIRST GO TO THE SHOWER THE PEOPLE WITH A TICKET 
THEN I'LL TAKE THE PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKET 
BUT AT FOUR O'CLOCK THIS AFTERNOON 
YOU HAVE NO TICKET YOU GET OUT YOU HAVE NO TICKETS YOU GET OUT 
THOUSANDS FLEE FROM WAR TORN COUNTRIES LIKE IRAQ AFGHANISTAN AND SOMALIA 
THEY ARRIVE EXHAUSTED HUNGRY AND IN NEED OF A SHOWER 
YOU WERE IN THE BACK YEAH 
MAN I'M PASSING IN FRONT OF THE I PASSED IN FRONT OF THE POLICE 
THERE IS THIRTEEN PEOPLE IN THE CAR 
JACKY VERHAEGEN WORKS FOR A FRENCH CHARITY THAT HELPS HOMELESS PEOPLE THROUGHOUT FRANCE 
TELL THEM TO BE SILENT IN THE HOUSE I DON'T WANT THE NEIGHBOURS 
I DON'T WANT THE NEIGHBOURS TO CALL THE POLICE ALL RIGHT 
TWICE A WEEK IN CALAIS THEY FEED FOUR HUNDRED REFUGEES 
THESE REFUGEES HAVE FUELLED THE INTENSE DEBATE ON IMMIGRATION 
CURRENTLY MANY IMMIGRANTS ARRIVE IN THE U. K. FROM THE NEW COUNTRIES 
OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND LIKE BRITISH CITIZENS THEY'RE FREE TO COME AND GO AS THEY WISH 
BUT THESE PEOPLE IN CALAIS HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHT OF ENTRY 
AND NOBODY KNOWS HOW MANY THERE ARE 
MOST OF THEM TRY TO GET TO THE U. K. 
BUT MOST OF THEM GOT WRONG INFORMATION ABOUT U. K. 
SO THAT'S A PROBLEM 
THEY ALL BELIEVE THAT THEY GONNA HAVE A JOB HAVE EVERYTHING THEY NEED IN ENGLAND 
IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL PART OF BRITAIN BUT PLYMOUTH IS NOT A TOURIST CITY 
IT'S A BIG CITY IT'S THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
IF PLYMOUTH'S AIRPORT IS COVERED IN FOG EVERYONE GOES BY TAXI 
SO THERE IS A LOT OF WORK COMING OUT OF PLYMOUTH 
THIS ISN'T PLYMOUTH IT'S A SCHOOL FOR TAXI DRIVERS IN PRAGUE 
THESE MEN AND WOMEN COME FROM COUNTRIES LIKE POLAND SLOVAKIA AND ROMANIA 
SINCE THE EUROPEAN UNION EXPANDED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THESE ARE THE PEOPLE 
WHO MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF EUROPEAN MIGRANTS TO THE U. K. 
ENGLISH TAXI DRIVERS WILL SAY ALL RIGHT MATE 
YOU WILL CALL THEM SIR MADAM 
YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT SEX YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT RELIGION 
YOU'RE GOING TO WORK FOR ORDINARY TAXI COMPANIES 
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN THE ENGLISH DRIVERS 
IF YOU'RE SMELLING OF BODY ODOUR IT'S NOT PLEASANT 
THEY WILL SAY OH THESE EASTERN EUROPEANS THEY STINK 
YOU CAN EXCEPT TO EARN AROUND ONE THOUSAND PER WEEK GROSS 
NO BULLSHIT FROM ME 
WE'RE DESPERATELY SHORT OF DRIVERS IN THE TAXI INDUSTRY 
DEMAND FOR FOREIGN LABOUR IS NOW SO GREAT THAT BRITISH COMPANIES 
ARE SETTING UP RECRUITMENT AGENCIES ACROSS EASTERN EUROPE 
IN THE PAST TWO YEARS THIS COMPANY ALONE HAS TRAINED ONE THOUSAND TAXI DRIVERS 
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT PLYMOUTH AND TOR QUAY 
TOR KEY TOR KEY 
HOW IS THE WEATHER THERE ALONG HERE 
CATALIN DOBRISAN WILL PAY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY FOR THIS COURSE FOR HIM 
THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF FOUR MONTHS' PAY IN HIS NATIVE ROMANIA 
HE IS JUST ONE OF AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE FROM CENTRAL 
AND EASTERN EUROPE WHO HAVE COME TO LIVE OR WORK IN THE U. K. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE 
CATALIN'S HOME IS IN THE CITY OF ORADEA IN WESTERN ROMANIA 
WHERE HE LIVES WITH HIS WIFE ANNA AND THEIR TWO CHILDREN 
LAST CHRISTMAS I'VE ONLY HAD IN MY POCKET 
ZERO POINT TWO ZERO LEI WHICH IS FOUR 
I HAD TO MANAGE SOMEHOW TO BUY SOME PRESENTS FOR MY CHILDREN 
O. K. I WAS IN THE SUPERMARKET CRYING AND I CURSED THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE 
OF THE SITUATION IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF 
I WANT TO HAVE THAT FREEDOM OF BUYING WHATEVER MY KIDS WANTS WHATEVER THEIR HEARTS' DESIRE 
I DO NOT WANT THEM TO HAVE TO SURVIVE 
LIKE I HAD TO SURVIVE 
I GREW WITH MY GRANDMOTHER UNTIL I WAS SIX 
AND WHEN I WAS SIX AND A HALF 
I MET MY FATHER FOR THE FIRST TIME 
DIDN'T LIKE HIM AND WHEN I WAS ALMOST EIGHT YEARS OLD 
I STARTED TO RUN AWAY AND ENDED UP ON THE STREETS 
TRY TO FEED THE WHEEL BETWEEN BOTH HANDS 
IN ENGLAND WE CALL IT THE TEN TO TWO 
THEY ARE AS ENTITLED TO GO AND WORK IN THE UNITED KINGDOM 
THERE ARE LARGE POLISH AND ROMANIAN COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE U. K. NOW 
GENERALLY THEY'VE BEEN RECEIVED QUITE WELL BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT 
PERCEIVED AS ASYLUM SEEKERS THESE ARE GUYS WHO HAVE 
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT TO GO AND WORK WHEREVER THEY LIKE 
YES THE ROMANIANS ARE NEW ARRIVALS IN THE U. K. BUT 
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN OF THEM SO FAR 
FORESEE NO PROBLEMS WITH THEM INTEGRATING INTO U. K. SOCIETY 
BRITISH HOTELS ARE HEAVILY RELIANT ON IMMIGRANT LABOUR 
KATHRYN RICHARDS A HOTEL OWNER IN LYME REGIS 
HAS TROUBLE RECRUITING BRITISH STAFF TO WORK FOR HER 
I HAD A PHONE CALL YESTERDAY FROM A GIRL HI RINGING ABOUT THE BAR POSITION 
GREAT YEAH TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF YOU HAD ANY EXPERIENCE ER NO 
RIGHT AND WHERE DO YOU LIVE BRIDPORT WHATEVER IT'S TEN MILES AWAY 
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT HOW YOU'LL GET TO WORK DO YOU DRIVE OR THE BUS 
I HAVEN'T REALLY IT'S JUST THAT IF I DON'T MAKE HOWEVER MANY 
PHONE CALLS TO APPLY FOR JOBS I WON'T GET MY BENEFITS 
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THE JOB BUT I HAVE TO MAKE THE PHONE CALL O. K. THANKS BYE AND YOU JUST THINK 
IT'S SUCH A TIME WASTING THING BUT IF THERE'S AN ENGLISH PERSON 
ON THE END OF THE PHONE THAT'S ALMOST WHAT YOU EXPECT TO HAVE 
SO WAITRESSING THE STYLE OF RESTAURANT THAT YOU WORKED IN DID YOU SAY IT WAS A FIRST CLASS LOUNGE 
IT WAS FIRST CLASS LOUNGE YES 
I WORKED THERE AS WAITRESS FOR EIGHT MONTHS I KNOW THAT 
KATHRYN'S LATEST RECRUIT IS YOLANTA BIKOVA 
WHO'S BEEN HIRED THROUGH ANOTHER BRITISH AGENCY THIS TIME IN LATVIA 
FROM ONE SIDE I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE LATVIA BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WAS BORN HERE AND I LIVE ALL MY LIFE 
BUT FROM ANOTHER SIDE I REALLY WANT TO MAKE MORE EXPERIENCE IN HOTEL AND MANAGEMENT 
IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL PLACE 
SOME PEOPLE WHO IS WORKING OVER THERE THEY'RE SAYING THAT 
THEY THINK THAT WE ARE COMING AND TAKING THEIR WORK THEIR JOBS 
I DON'T THINK THAT IS TRUE BECAUSE IF YOU WANT WORK AND IF YOU 
REALLY WANT YOU COULD FIND WORK AND YOU COULD GO YOU COULD PROGRESS 
YOLANTA'S MOVE ISN'T MOTIVATED BY MONEY 
SHE'S IN IT FOR THE ADVENTURE 
SHE'S YOUNG FREE AND WANTS TO SEE THE WORLD 
FIRST I WILL PUT HERE EVERYTHING SO I MUST KNOW WHAT I'M TAKING WITH ME 
I'M THE PERSON WHO CAN'T SIT DOWN IN ONE PLACE YOU KNOW 
I'M NOT THAT PERSON WHO COULD LIVE FOR ALL MY LIFE 
AND COULD DO JUST ONE 
I'M THE PERSON WHO MUST TRAVEL TO SEE ALL AROUND HOW 
HOW LOOKS ANOTHER PLACE IS ANOTHER COUNTRIES 
TO TAKE OPPORTUNITY 
WE LIVE JUST ONCE 
OH YOU SEE WHAT HAT I HAVE 
I LIKE HATS 
SO UMBRELLA AS WELL OF COURSE 
AND MAYBE I NEED MAYBE THERE IS RAINING AND SNOWING I DON'T KNOW 
I MUST BE HONEST I AM A LITTLE BIT SAD ABOUT MY BOYFRIEND BECAUSE 
I'M LEAVING AND HE'S STAYING HERE 
AND OF COURSE IF HE WILL LOVE ME HE WILL WAIT FOR ME I THINK SO 
IS HE TOO SHY TO COME IN 
YEAH HE WAS TOO SHY 
SO WE JUST SAID GOODBYE NEAR THE DOORS 
AND I GUESS I WILL PHONE HIM LATER 
MOST DAYS AROUND FOUR HUNDRED MIGRANTS GATHER IN CAR PARKS AND WASTELAND AROUND CALAIS 
WHERE ARE YOU LIVING

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE GOING

I CAN FIND A SOLUTION FOR YOU I CAN HELP YOU TO STAY IN FRANCE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU 
I TRY TO GIVE THE MIGRANTS INFORMATION ON THE POSSIBILITY FOR THEM TO APPLY ASYLUM IN FRANCE 
AND THEN I'M TRYING TO HELP THEM TO BUILD THEIR CASE COS IF YOU WANT 
TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM YOU HAVE TO TELL THE REASON WHY YOU RAN AWAY FROM YOUR COUNTRY 
AND THEN THEY ARE TAKING DECISION BY THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY WANT TO STAY HERE AND THEN I CAN HELP THEM 
OR IF THEY WANT TO GO TO ENGLAND AND I DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY'RE GETTING THERE YOU KNOW 
THIS IS NOT MY BUSINESS 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO TO U. K. 
U. K. YEAH WHY 
BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS LIKE U. K. 
I LIKE U. K. BECAUSE I SPEAK ENGLISH BECAUSE THE CHILDREN LIKE SCHOOL 
THIS IS ENGLISH LIKE 
NO PROPER ACCOMMODATION IS PROVIDED FOR THESE REFUGEES AND THE POLICE WON'T LET THEM SLEEP ON THE STREETS 
SO EVERY DAY THEY HEAD FOR MAKESHIFT CAMPS IN WOODLAND ADJOINING THE MOTORWAY 
SOME WILL TAKE THEIR CHANCE OF HIDING IN A LORRY BOUND FOR ENGLAND 
IN PRAGUE CATALIN IS REVISING HARD 
HE MUST PASS THE FIRST TAXI DRIVERS' EXAM HE'LL FACE 
IF HIS DREAM OF A NEW LIFE IN PLYMOUTH IS TO BECOME A REALITY 
I INSIST THAT YOU ACHIEVE NINETY PER CENT 
NINE ZERO 
IF I CATCH YOU CHEATING YOU'RE GONE 
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE WITH THE LIST ROLLED UP INSIDE THEIR TIES 
THEY HAVE IT INSIDE THEIR SOCKS 
IDEALLY I WOULD HAVE YOU TAKE YOUR TEST NAKED 
THAT WAY I COULD ENSURE THAT YOU'RE NOT CHEATING 
ALL WHAT I'M DREAMING OF TO 
ACHIEVE IS THAT 
I'D LIKE TO HAVE MY HOUSE AND JUST HAVING A PEACEFUL TIME 
NEXT TO GOOD COFFEE

HE DOESN'T USUALLY OFFER LIFTS BUT HE'S WORRIED ABOUT THE CHILD

THERE'S A VERY THIN LINE BETWEEN HELPING AS A CHARITY AND HELPING THEM ALMOST GET ACROSS THE CHANNEL 
I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR I DON'T HELP THEM GET ACROSS 
THEY DECIDE TO GET ACROSS 
WE'RE THE CLOSEST BORDER TO ENGLAND 
THERE IS EASY WAY TO GET TO ENGLAND FROM HERE 
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE HERE YOU KNOW THEY ARE FOR THE CHARITIES 
I UNDERSTAND THAT FOR SOME ENGLISH PEOPLE IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND THAT 
WE'RE THERE THAT WE'RE HELPING THEM BUT 
THEY NEED HELP 
THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS LIKE YOU AND ME 
THEY ARE SUFFERING THEY'VE BEEN SUFFERING IN THEIR COUNTRY 
THEY'RE SUFFERING ALL ACROSS THEIR JOURNEY
