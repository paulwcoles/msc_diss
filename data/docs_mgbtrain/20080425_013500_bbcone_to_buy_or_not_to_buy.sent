GEMMA'S TAKING AN INTERIOR DESIGN COURSE 
AND WANTS TO GET STUCK INTO DESIGNING THE DECOR IN THEIR NEW HOUSE 
AND WHILE GRAHAM IS IN THE OTHER ROOM PLAYING COMPUTER GAMES 
GEMMA HAS A MORE EXOTIC HOBBY 
SHE HAS A POLE AND A RATHER UNUSUAL WAY OF KEEPING FIT 
YIKES LOOK AT THAT 
MAN ALIVE 
I WONDER IF YOU NEED A SPECIAL SORT OF HOUSE TO ACCOMMODATE A POLE LIKE THAT 
ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT 
BEFORE WE PROCEED I FEEL I NEED TO ASK QUITE A RUDE QUESTION 
YOU CAN'T ASK THE BUDGET PRICE ALREADY 
I'VE GOT ANOTHER RUDE QUESTION AGES YOU LOOK TOO YOUNG 
YES SEVENTEEN 
SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE O. K. PHYSICALLY I'M TWENTY FOUR 
MENTALLY TWELVE OR SO RIGHT YOU'RE IN OUR GANG 
SO YOU'RE YOUNG YOU'RE OUT THERE

SEPARATE ROOMS REALLY RIGHT HOW MANY BEDROOMS DO YOU WANT 
IT WOULD BE THREE FOR PREFERENCE BUT IF THEY WERE VERY BIG THEN TWO 
BUT THREE REALLY YEAH A BEDROOM AND THEN ONE FOR EACH COMPUTER 
EVEN IF ONE'S SMALL O. K. 
THREE BEDROOMS ARE YOU WANTING TO ENTERTAIN OUTSIDE SPACE ETC ETC 
A GARDEN WOULD BE NICE 
YEAH IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ANYTHING SPECTACULAR 
BUT SOMEWHERE I CAN PUT A SWING BALL UP 
DO YOU NEED THE DREADED G. WORD 
OH YEAH THE G. WORD GARAGE 
GARAGE WE'D QUITE LIKE ONE BUT NOT TO PUT A CAR IN SO WE CAN 
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO PUT IN IT A GIANT COMPUTER

JUST PLAIN CREAM WALLS NOT TOO MUCH FURNITURE 
NOW THE AREA ARE WE STAYING WITHIN LINCOLN ITSELF 
WE WANT TO BE CLOSE TO LINCOLN DON'T WE 
YEAH CLOSE ENOUGH FOR A TAXI RIDE HOME FROM THE PUB 
THERE'S A FEW VILLAGES AROUND BUT NOT TOO FAR OUT O. K. I LIKE THAT 
I'LL ASK THE BIG DIRTY QUESTION 
HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE HAVE TO SPEND ON THIS THREE BEDROOMED PROPERTY 
WITH A GARAGE AND GARDEN SEMI DETACHED IN SUBURBIA 
WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TEN 
THOUSAND NOT POUNDS IS THAT DOABLE 
I THINK WE MIGHT BE STRETCHING 
WE'LL PROBABLY COMPROMISE ON WHAT WE WANT 
PLEASE DON'T EVER TAKE THE POLE DANCING HOBBY AWAY THOUGH 
O. K. WELL WE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO FIND SOMETHING THAT FITS YOUR BILL 
I'M CROSSING BOTH OF THEM AND THESE 
WHICH WAY DO YOU WANT TO GO 
THAT WAY ALL RIGHT SEE YOU LATER 
MY GOODNESS THEY WANT A LOT FOR THEIR MONEY

I'M GOING TO FIND SOME HIGH ENERGY DISCO TO SPUR YOU ON 
REMIXED BY DAVID MORALES THAT WOULD BE GOOD SEE YOU LATER SEE YOU 
I ACTUALLY CAN'T WAIT 
NOW THE BEAUTIFUL CITY OF LINCOLN 
HAS BEEN VOTED ONE OF THE U. K.'S TOP TEN FAVOURITE CITIES 
THE CASTLE HERE WAS BUILT IN NORMAN TIMES 
AND WAS USED AS A COURTHOUSE AND JAIL FOR OVER NINE HUNDRED YEARS 
LINCOLN CROWN COURT STILL STANDS WITHIN ITS WALLS 
MAJESTIC LINCOLN CATHEDRAL IS REGARDED AS ONE OF THE FINEST MEDIEVAL BUILDINGS IN EUROPE 
AND WAS USED IN THE FILM THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
THIS CITY HAS ITS OWN WORKING WINDMILL 
WHICH POKES OUT FROM AMONGSE ROWS OF HOUSES 
AND IT STILL MILLS FLOUR AT THE WEEKENDS 
ONE OF THE MOST PICTURESQUE STREETS IS CALLED STEEP HILL 
AND IT ISN'T CALLED THAT FOR NOTHING 
CAN YOU IMAGINE DOING THIS ON A PUB CRAWL 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE TWO WORDS YOU NEED TO KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN LINCOLN ARE 
ERM UPHILL AND DOWNHILL 
UPHILL IS THE AREA AROUND THE CASTLE AND CATHEDRAL 
HOME TO MANY OF THE CITY'S BEAUTIFUL HISTORIC BUILDINGS 
PACKED WITH SPECIALIST SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS 
AND DOWNHILL IS WHERE YOU'LL FIND MODERN SHOPPING PRECINCTS 
NEWER BUILDINGS AND THE VIBRANT BRAYFORD WATERFRONT AREA 
UPHILL THE AVERAGE HOUSE FOR A TERRACE IS AROUND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO THOUSAND 
WHEREAS DOWNHILL IT'S THIRTY GRAND LESS 
WHICH SOUNDS MUCH MORE PROMISING FOR OUR ONE HUNDRED TEN K. 
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU GET FOR THAT AROUND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
WELL SITUATED JUST A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE HEART OF WHITEHAVEN 
AND ITS HISTORIC HARBOUR AREA IS THIS TALL MID TERRACED HOUSE 
MODERN AND WELL PRESENTED THROUGHOUT 
THERE'S ONE POSSIBLY TWO BEDROOMS A DINING ROOM 
BEAUTIFUL TILED BATHROOM 
AND TWO STYLISH SPIRAL STAIRCASES ALL FOR ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
BUT FOR SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT 
HOW ABOUT THIS PARK HOME WITH LOVELY GARDENS IN KING'S LYNN 
JUST FIVE YEARS OLD IT'S GOT TWO BEDROOMS WITH ONE EN SUITE 
A LOUNGE SEPARATE DINING ROOM FULLY FITTED KITCHEN 
AND PARKING FOR UP TO FOUR CARS 
ALSO ON AT EXACTLY ONE HUNDRED TEN GRAND 
HOWEVER IN THE CROSSGATE SUBURB OF LEEDS 
YOU COULD AFFORD THIS ONE BEDROOMED FIRST FLOOR FLAT 
MODERNISED THROUGHOUT IT'S GOT A GOOD SIZED LOUNGE 
BEDROOM WITH EN SUITE AND A FITTED KITCHEN 
IT'S JUST UNDER TODAY'S BUDGET AT ONE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND 
BUT EDDIE POOS WE NEED SOMETHING IN LOVELY LINCOLN 
RIGHT SO HOUSE HUNTING IN LOVELY LINCOLN 
LINCOLN IS VERY HILLY AND THERE ARE AREAS KNOWN AS UPHILL AND DOWNHILL 
AND APPARENTLY THERE IS A DIFFERENCE 
SO I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS 
MY NAME'S ED PLEASED TO MEET YOU HI I'M KEVIN 
UPHILL AND DOWNHILL YES 
TWO AREAS OF LINCOLN YES 
STOP ME IF I'M WRONG THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM 
ONE'S UPHILL AND ONE'S DOWNHILL 
I'M LOOKING FOR A HOUSE FOR A LADY WHO WANTS A GARAGE 
WITH WHICH SHE CAN POLE DANCE IN RIGHT 
IN THE OLDEN DAYS THOSE UPHILLERS REGARDED THEMSELVES AS PERHAPS A LITTLE ABOVE THOSE DOWNHILLERS 
OH REALLY OH YES 
THEY WANT THREE BEDROOMS A GARAGE OUTDOOR SPACE IF POSSIBLE 
WE'VE GOT ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND RIGHT ONE HUNDRED TEN 
DO YOU LIVE UPHILL NO I USED TO 
I KNEW IT ONE LOOK AT YOU AND I THOUGHT UPHILL 
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE ISN'T THERE OH YES 
THE PRIME AREA WOULD BE UPHILL VERY VERY POPULAR VERY PRICEY 
WHEN I WERE YOUNGER 
I NEVER USED TO COME PAST THE TOP OF THE HIGH STREET 
SO THREE YEARS AGO YOU DIDN'T EVER GO UP THERE 
THAT'S RIGHT HE'S A CHARMER ISN'T HE 
YOU GET DOWNHILL AND AROUND BRAYFORD 
THERE'S LOTS OF NEW APARTMENTS BEING BUILT 
UPHILL OR DOWNHILL WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE 
IT'S HARD WORK IT'S HARD WORK UPHILL 
IT'S EASIER COMING DOWN THAT'S TRUE 
THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR MODERN TWO BEDROOM SEMIS AND TERRACES 
IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS THE SUBURBS 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT TIGHT ON SPACE 
PARTICULARLY SECOND BEDROOM 
THE SHOPS ARE NICER UPHILL ARE THEY 
THE HOUSES ARE SOMETIMES NICER UPHILL 
IT'S EASIER DOWN HERE BECAUSE THERE'S MORE STUFF DOWN HERE 
NOW IF THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE 
AND WANT TO LOOK CLOSER TO THE CITY CENTRE 
YOU KNOW THERE'S QUITE A WEALTH OF QUITE SPACIOUS VICTORIAN PROPERTIES 
O. K. AND IF THEY GET SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DONE UP TO A GOOD STANDARD 
THEY'RE GOING TO GET MORE VALUE FOR MONEY 
IT'S POSHER THIS WAY I'VE HEARD 
OH YES IT'S POSHER DO I GET POSHER THE MORE I WALK 
YES DEAR RIGHT YES DEAR YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
WISH ME LUCK AS I GET OUT THERE AMONGST THE PEOPLE 
GOOD LUCK ED THANK YOU 
KRISTIAN AND I HAVE BEEN HAVING AN ABSOLUTELY LOVELY TIME IN LINCOLN 
IT IS BEAUTIFUL HE'S GOT A LITTLE BIT MOIST 
I AM MY TWEED IS ALL WILTED WAS IT WORTH IT IT WAS WORTH IT 
OUR PROPERTY HUNTING TEAM HAVE BEEN SCOURING THE AREA 
UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS IN THEIR NIGHTGOWNS 
KRISTIAN AND I HAVE PRESSED OUR NOSES AGAINST THE METAPHORICAL WINDOWS 
AND WE HAVE CHOSEN THREE 
THEY ARE BEAUTIES GO ON WHAT HAVE YOU GONE WITH FIRST 
HERE SHE IS THIS IS A BEAUTY 
DOESN'T HAVE A GARAGE 
AND WE HAVE WORKED OUT PRETTY MUCH 
SHE CAN'T HAVE A GARAGE AT ALL FOR HER POLE DANCING 
SO I SUGGEST MAYBE IF YOU SEE A BLUE CAR THERE 
SHE CAN POLE DANCE OUTSIDE THE FRONT 
THAT WOULD ADD VALUE TO THE AREA WE FIGURED 
SHE COULD POLE DANCE IN ONE OF THE THREE BEDROOMS 
OR THE LOUNGE DINER 
OR THE KITCHEN OR THE SEPARATE BATHROOM AND W. C. 
O. K. THAT MAY BE GOOD BUT THIS IS BETTER 
FOR A START IT'S UPHILL WE KNOW ALL ABOUT UPHILL 
IT DOESN'T HAVE A GARAGE FOR THE POLE DANCING CAN I JUST SAY TO YOU 
POLE DANCING IN THE PORCH REALLY THINK OF THAT AS A WELCOME 
YOUR NEIGHBOURS COME TO CALL 
MEAT LOAF IN THE OVEN OPEN THE FRONT DOOR THERE SHE IS 
POLE DANCING IN THE PORCH BRILLIANT HERE'S THE WILD CARD 
NOW THIS HAS ONLY GOT TWO BEDROOMS 
BUT IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND I THINK GRAHAM IS GOING TO LIKE THIS YEAH 
THEY'RE ALL LOVELY 
I'M STILL LIVID THAT YOU'VE MANAGED TO GET AN UPHILL LOCATION 
AND A GARDEN AS WELL BEAUTIFUL VERY VERY NICE 
SHOULD WE START THE VIEWINGS AT PROPERTY NUMBER MY ONE 
LET'S GET A WIGGLE ON 
WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU HERE IS A MID TERRACED PROPERTY 
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS BEEN WELL LOVED 
IT'S GOT THREE ENORMOUS DOUBLE BEDROOMS 
A COSY LIVING ROOM SEPARATE BATHROOM AND W. C. AND A BACK GARDEN 
WITH THREE RELAXING AREAS 
NEVER MIND YOUR THREE RELAXING AREAS 
THERE ARE A PLETHORA OF OPTIONS FOR GEMMA TO POSITION HER POLE 
GEMMA AND GRAHAM 
WHAT LOVELY WEATHER LINCOLN HAS OFFERED US TODAY 
I AM SOAKING RIGHT HERE WE GO 
NOW THIS IS MY CHOICE 
PROPERTY NUMERO UNO 
ONE NEGATIVE FACTOR YOU'RE DRIPPING ALL OVER ME GRAHAM THERE IS NO 
WHO'S PUTTING THE UMBRELLA ON MY HEAD 
IF YOU'RE MOANING I'LL DO THAT 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO ARGUE ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW 
THERE IS NO GARAGE HERE WHICH 
I MEAN WE COULD RIG A POLE UP HERE BUT IT MIGHT BE A BIT PUBLIC 
I DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD YOU ARE 
WE DO HAVE THREE BEDROOMS I'VE GOT EVERYTHING ELSE 
I'VE GOT SOMETHING EXTRA SPECIAL IN THE BACK GARDEN 
WHICH MAY DOUBLE AS THE OLD POLE ROOM 
I'M NOT GOING TO STAND OUT HERE MUCH LONGER 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT THAT'S THE MAIN THING 
YEAH IT LOOKS ALL RIGHT LOOKS NICE WHEN YOU'RE OUTSIDE ISN'T IT 
IT'S NOT FALLING DOWN EXACTLY WHICH IS GOOD 
GO IN THERE ENJOY YOURSELF BECAUSE THIS IS DREADFUL WEATHER 
RIGHT AND I THINK YOU AND I IRONICALLY SHOULD GO IN THE 
IS THIS YOU USING THIS UMBRELLA YOU NEED LESSONS 
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE SUMMER HOUSE 
LIKE A WOODEN CHATEAU AT THE END OF THE GARDEN THERE'S THE SUMMER HOUSE 
PLOUGH ON IN IT IS BEAUTIFUL LET'S SEE WHAT THEY MAKE OF IT 
THAT'S A BIG ROOM YEAH A DECENT SIZE ISN'T IT 
WE COULD LOSE THAT FIREPLACE 
PLENTY OF ROOM FOR A NICE BIG T. V. WHEN WE GET ONE 
STRAIGHT INTO IT YOU'RE GETTING COMPLIMENTS STRAIGHT OFF 
I LIKE THE LITTLE KIND OF YEAH 
FIT THE SOFA THERE IT'S SOFA SIZED ISN'T IT 
IT'S QUITE GOOD 
SEEMS TO GET QUITE A LOT OF LIGHT FROM OUTSIDE YEAH 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TOO DARK NO NO IT'S NICE 
NOW THAT LOUNGE THERE NOW SHE'S INTO HER INTERIOR DESIGN 
I'VE BEEN GIVING SOME THOUGHT TO THAT 
WORKING WITH THE SALMON I'M THINKING GREEN WORKS 
I'VE GOT SOME SAMPLES HERE ED 
WHICH COLOUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO WITH 
THE DARKER GREEN OR THE PALER GREEN 
THAT'S QUITE NICE ISN'T IT 
YEAH IT'S QUITE A SMALL KITCHEN ISN'T IT 
THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM FOR EVERYTHING YOU'LL GET EVERYTHING IN THERE 
THERE ISN'T A BIT FOR A STANDING FRIDGE THOUGH 
I'M GONNA BRING IN A SALMON SCATTER CUSHION 
HE'S GOOD AND I THINK THAT COMBO IN THE LOUNGE THAT IS HORRIBLE 
I LIKE THE DOOR HANDLES AS WELL 
THEY'RE QUITE CUTE WHAT'S THAT 
DOWNSTAIRS TOILET OH O. K. 
IT'S USEFUL A CLOAKROOM AS WELL SO 
THAT'S QUITE GOOD YEAH IT IS 
COULD GET SOME STUFF UP ON THE TOP KEEP IT OUT OF SIGHT 
THAT IS HORRIBLE I THINK IT WOULD LOOK QUITE NICE 
YOU'D HAVE TO ACCESSORISE IT WITH ROMAN BLINDS 
OH IT'S A DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 
OH RIGHT YEAH 
THAT'S QUITE 
I WONDER IF THIS IS THE ONLY BATHROOM I WOULD THINK IT IS 
YEAH I WOULD GUESS SO YEAH 
YOU THOUGHT THIS WOULD TRIP ME UP NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL 
IT'S GOOD THAT IT'S STILL SEPARATE FROM THE TOILET 
THEY'RE VERY PRETTY TILES YEAH THEY GO 
IN THIS WORLD OF WHERE YOU HAVE TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY 
AND SAVE WATER I THINK TAKING A BATH AND MAYBE WASHING YOUR SPUDS 
AT THE SAME TIME IN YOUR BATHWATER COULD POSSIBLY BE VERY ECO FRIENDLY 
IT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA 
IT'S QUITE A SMALL HALLWAY AGAIN ISN'T IT 
BUT AT LEAST IT'S PALE COLOURS 
THIS MUST BE IT'S A DECENT SIZE ISN'T IT 
YOU'D GET EVERYTHING IN HERE 
THE MASTER BEDROOM 
IT'S PROBABLY BIGGER THAN OUR ONE AT THE MOMENT 
YEAH IT'S LONG ISN'T IT 
IF BILL GATES WANTED A BEDROOM FOR A COMPUTER 
THIS WOULD BE HIS FIRST CHOICE I WOULD IMAGINE 
SHOE CUPBOARD YOU COULD PUT A RAIL UP IN THERE HAVE A WARDROBE 
I'LL NEED THAT JUST FOR MY SHOES THOUGH 
YOU COULD CHUCK SOME OF THEM OUT 
BEDROOM NUMBER TWO IT'S ANOTHER COMPUTER ROOM AND THIS ONE I FEEL IS GOING TO BE MORE FOR HIM 
THIS COULD BE THE MASTER BEDROOM AS WELL 
THEY'RE A SIMILAR SIZE AREN'T THEY FITTED WARDROBES IN HERE IS USEFUL 
NO EVERY ONE'S A MASTER BEDROOM SIZE WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT 
IT'S A DECENT SIZE FOR A SECOND ROOM ISN'T IT YEAH 
YOU COULD HAVE A COMPUTER IN HERE 
I'M NOT LIKING THE WALLPAPER AGAIN NO 
I'D STRIP THAT OFF IN HERE MOST CERTAINLY 
IF I WAS HER I WOULD IMPROVISE 
AT EVERY DOOR JAMB AND EVERY DOOR FRAME 
I WOULD WANT TO GIVE A SHAKE 
THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE NOT HER 
I MIGHT TREAT YOU TO THAT LATER ON I DO NOT EVER WANT TO SEE THAT 
WOW THAT'S ANOTHER REALLY GOOD SIZED BEDROOM 
THREE BEDROOMS I WAS EXPECTING A BOX ROOM 
I WAS BUT IT'S REALLY NICE 
PLENTY OF ROOM FOR EVERYTHING I COULD STILL FIT MY POLE IN HERE 
SHE'S FITTING A POLE IN THERE SHE'S ONLY POPPING A POLE IN THAT ROOM 
OH YOU CAN SEE A PATH YEAH THAT'S REALLY NICE 
YOU'VE GOT SOME POLES OVER THERE YOU COULD PLAY ON 
FOR ME LOOKING OUT THAT BACK GATE THERE INTO THAT PARKLAND 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE HAVING YOUR OWN ESTATE 
OH IT IS IT'S LIKE BEING LORD OF THE LINCOLN MANOR 
THAT'S REALLY GOOD IT'S A NICE GARDEN 
YEAH PLENTY OF ROOM FOR A BARBECUE 
THERE'S GRASS BUT NOT A LOT SO IT WON'T TAKE A LOT OF LOOKING AFTER YEAH 
DO YOU KNOW I ONCE BOUGHT A HOUSE 
AND WHEN THEY MOVED THEY TOOK THE RHUBARB POT FROM THE GARDEN 
REALLY IT'S BROKEN HIM 
HERE'S A. 
NICE GRAVEL DOWN HERE IT'S EASY TO TAKE CARE OF I GUESS YEAH IT IS 
IT'S STILL QUITE NICE ISN'T IT 
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE TAKEN CARE OF THE GARDEN WENDY HOUSE 
THIS ISN'T A WENDY HOUSE IT'S A SUMME R. HOUSE 
IT'S GOOD DOWN HERE IT IS YEAH JUST KEEPS COMING 
THEY'RE THERE THEY'RE JUST THERE 
IT IS NICE IT'S STILL QUITE PRIVATE YEAH YEAH 
THIS HOUSE HAS SET GRAHAM AND GEMMA AFLAME 
IT'S AN INFERNO ISN'T IT IT REALLY IS 
I'M GONNA GO AND SEE WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT IT IN PERSON 
GEMMA I'VE BROUGHT YOU UPSTAIRS 
TO TALK ABOUT POLES AND POLE ERGONOMICS COS I'M THINKING 
THE ROOMS ARE A GOOD SIZE 
BUT YOU NEED QUITE A LOT OF SPACE TO FLING YOURSELF AROUND A ROOM 
IF YOU PUT A POLE HERE WHEN YOU DO THE FANCY MOVES 
YOU'RE GONNA GRAZE YOURSELF AGAINST THE TEXTURED WALLPAPER AREN'T YOU YES 
WHAT DO YOU THINK WHERE WOULD IT GO 
IT WOULD PROBABLY GO BANG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM 
BUT YOU'RE GONNA LOSE SO MUCH SPACE FROM YOUR ROOM IF YOUR POLE'S THERE 
ONLY WHEN IT'S IN USE 
WE WERE ALSO THINKING OF DOING 
WITH THE MONEY THAT WE WOULD SAVE CONVERTING THE GARAGE 
COS YOU DON'T HAVE A GARAGE HERE 
I WOULD USE THAT TO MAYBE CONVERT THE ATTIC 
O. K. THEN SOMEHOW TRY AND SET STAIRS UP 
AND EITHER HAVE THE POLE IN THE ATTIC 
OR HAVE JUST THE POLE DOWN HERE AND THE COMPUTERS IN THE ATTIC O. K. 
THAT MIGHT WORK SHALL WE FIND OUT HOW MUCH THIS PROPERTY'S ON THE MARKET FOR 
AND IF THERE'S MONEY LEFT OVER TO GIVE YOUR POLE ITS OWN HOME 
EXCELLENT DOWNSTAIRS 
HERE WE ARE IN THE SUMMER HOUSE IT'S LOVELY 
YOU WANT ENTERTAINING SPACE FOR YOUR MATES TO COME ROUND 
YOU QUITE FANCY THE IDEA OF HAVING A BAR 
I WOULD QUITE LIKE TO HAVE A BAR 
COULD THIS RIG TAKE IT 
I THINK IT COULD YEAH IT WOULDN'T NEED MUCH 
JUST A BEER FRIDGE DOWN THERE AND AN AREA ON TOP FOR THE TEQUILA 
OR DO YOU THINK BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOT A GARAGE 
THIS MIGHT BE POLEABLE 
GEMMA WAS SAYING THAT I'M NOT SURE IF THE CEILING WOULD SUPPORT IT 
BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM INSIDE ANYWAY 
SO WE WOULDN'T NEED TO RELEGATE IT OUTSIDE 
THE HOUSE HAS GOT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING YOU NEED 
SHALL WE FIND OUT HOW MUCH IT COSTS O. K. 
RIGHT GRAHAM AND GEMMA YOUR BUDGET IS ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
IT'S GUESS THE PRICE WHO'S GOOD WITH MONEY PROBABLY ME PROBABLY YOU 
YOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF DOWN VERY EARLY ON 
I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO REDEEM YOURSELF 
EDWARD'S CHOICE HOW MUCH 
I'M GONNA GO FOR ONE HUNDRED TWELVE 
ONE HUNDRED TWELVE ALL RIGHT GRAHAM GO ON YOU'VE GOT TO WIN 
I THINK A BIT MORE THAN THAT I'LL GO ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
INTERESTING 
WELL IT'S HEADY PRAISE FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY 
IT'S ACTUALLY UNDER BUDGET WHICH MEANS CONGRATS TO YOU GEMMA YES 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT UNDER BUDGET COS THE ACTUAL PRICE IS ONE HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
REALLY WOW YOU SEE 
I NEVER SPEND OVER BUDGET 
YOU COULDN'T AFFORD IT SO I'D NEVER DO IT 
YOU HAVE NO I HAVEN'T YOU HAVE 
NO I HAVEN'T I'VE NEVER DONE IT 
WE'LL ARGUE ABOUT IT LATER BECAUSE NOW 
PROPERTY NUMBER TWO MY CHOICE DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT YES 
YOU WANT TO SEE IT WE DO GOOD IT'S THIS WAY 
I THINK I'VE DONE RATHER WELL WITH PROPERTY TWO 
ALSO A MID TERRACE BUT BIGGER ALL ROUND 
AND IN THAT DESIRABLE UPHILL LOCATION 
THE INTERIOR IS SUPERBLY DECORATED 
THERE'S THREE BEDROOMS A LOUNGE A KITCHEN 
DINING ROOM AND A CONSERVATORY 
IN TRUTH I THINK MINE ACTUALLY HAS MORE SPACE FOR GEMMA TO SWING ROUND HER POLE ED 
O. K. GEMMA AND GRAHAM HERE'S THE PROPERTY THAT I FOUND FOR YOU 
AND I'M QUITE PLEASED WITH THIS FIND 
BECAUSE EDWARD'S WAS LOVELY BUT THIS HAS LOADS MORE SPACE 
IT'S A MUCH BIGGER HOUSE IT LOOKS BIGGER 
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT CONVERTING ED'S PROPERTY IN THE ATTIC 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRICKY HERE HUGE PITCH ABSOLUTELY GIGANTIC 
ALSO I'VE BEEN DOING A BIT OF RESEARCH 
AND CAN I TELL YOU SHOULD YOUR POLE EVER BREAK 
THE LAMP POSTS ROUND HERE ARE FANTASTIC THEY DO GET A LOT OF WORK 
I HAVE GIVEN THEM A LITTLE TEST DRIVE 
AND I CAN SWIZZLE ROUND THAT LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS 
THE TELEGRAPH POLE IS O. K. LITTLE BIT TOO CHUNKY ROUND THE THIGHS 
ENOUGH SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE HOUSE 
YOU CAN'T TELL A LOT FROM OUT HERE 
BUT IT DOES LOOK BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONE 
IT IS A NICE AREA IT'S NOT BAD 
I NEED TO WARN GRAHAM 
THERE ARE SOME WALLS IN THERE THAT HAVE COLOUR ON THEM 
ALL RIGHT YOU'VE BEEN WARNED YOU CAN ALWAYS PUT CREAM ON THEM 
AT THE MOMENT THERE'S COLOUR IN THERE 
I'M WARNING YOU NOW FOR HIS SAKE 
SHALL WE SEND THEM IN I THINK WE SHOULD 
GET IN THERE DIVE IN 
BIG PITCH IT'S A LOVELY PITCH ISN'T IT IT IS A MASSIVE PITCH 
I CAN SEE TWO BIG DORMERS STICKING OUT

THAT'S A NICE PORCH ISN'T IT YEAH IT'S NICE TO HAVE A PORCH 
SOMEWHERE TO PUT YOUR SHOES AND THINGS 
THAT'S VERY RED 
YES QUITE BOLD ISN'T IT YEAH IT IS QUITE BOLD 
BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE A DINING ROOM 
INTERESTINGLY THE VICTORIANS LOVED A RED DINING ROOM BECAUSE IT AIDED DIGESTION OR SO THEY BELIEVED 
DID IT THOUGH I'VE NEVER REALLY DONE ANY TESTS TO FIND OUT

WE'VE GONE FROM RED TO PURPLE NOW 
I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THAT REALLY 
YEAH I DO I LIKE THE FIREPLACE AS WELL 
I LIKE THE FIREPLACE ACTUALLY THAT IS NICE 
IT MAKES A CHANGE HAVING A PROPER FIREPLACE 
IT LOOKS GOOD WITH A COLOUR ON THE FIREPLACE 
YEAH LIKE A FEATURE WALL 
I'M THINKING IF YOU ACCESSORISE 
THERE'S SOME MORE FLORAL NOTES NEAR THE FIREPLACE 
THEN THE SCATTER CUSHION WITH THE MAUVE TO PULL IN WITH THE ACCENT WALL 
SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT REALISE VIEWERS 
HE THINKS THAT ROOM COULD DO WITH SOME FEATURES LIKE THIS THEY'RE FROM THAT ROOM 
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A CONSERVATORY 
I DON'T THINK I'VE LIVED ANYWHERE THAT'S HAD ONE 
THEY'RE REALLY NICE YEAH 
DO YOU LIKE IT'S NICE ISN'T IT 
LOOKS ALL RIGHT DOESN'T IT QUITE A DECENT SIZE SWING 
THE SWING DOES THAT COME WITH THE HOUSE

IT'S A VERY BLUE ROOM 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE KRISTIAN POLE DANCE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
NO NOT NOW MAYBE LATER 
YOU'D STRUGGLE TO FIT THE DOUBLE BED IN HERE THOUGH 
BUT IT WOULD WORK AS AN OFFICE YEAH I SUPPOSE 
IT'S BIGGER THAN THE THIRD ROOM WE'VE GOT NOW ISN'T IT DEFINITELY

YOU'VE GOT TO BE HOLDING IT AT SOME POINT ARE YOU READY GO 
BATHROOM THAT'S A SMALL BATHROOM BIG BATH THOUGH

YEAH IT IS ACTUALLY THAT DOES MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE DOESN'T IT 
ESPECIALLY FOR TIME IN THE MORNING 
OH HEAVENS TO BETSY NOT WITH A SMILE LIKE THAT 
I LIKE THAT LIGHT 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SUNFLOWER 
WHICH WOULD GO WITH MY NATURE THEME THAT I'M DOING THE BATHROOM IN 
I'M GONNA GROW SOME MINT AND THAT COULD GROW ABOVE THE TOILET 
SHE'S GOING TO GROW MINT ABOVE THE TOILET 
I WOULD PERSONALLY JUST BUY TOOTHPASTE 
OH GOOD LORD IT'S PURPLE

DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO HER ABOUT THE MINT IN THE TOILET OR SHALL I 
SOMEONE HAS TO BROACH IT HAVEN'T THEY 
SO I THINK YOU LIKE THE HOUSE YES GOOD AND YOU LIKE THE BATHROOM 
YES WHICH IS GOOD I NOW NEED TO ASK A QUESTION 
WHY ARE YOU GROWING MINT IN THE BATHROOM 
THAT WOULD BE AWFUL WITH YOUR NEW POTATOES

O. K. I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU MORE OPTIONS TO GROW MINT O. K. 
O. K. BECAUSE YOU'D LIKE A DOWNSTAIRS LOO 
YEAH WE HAVE GOT THE SPACE UNDERNEATH THE STAIRS 
WHAT I AM THINKING IS THIS COULD BE CONVERTED 
YOU COULD BOX IT OUT GIVE YOURSELF SOME SPACE 
AND JUST CREATE YOUR OWN CONVENIENCE DOWNSTAIRS 
ARE YOU GETTING THE FULL EFFECT WE HAVE GIVEN IT SOME VISUAL MOTIF 
I'M AWFULLY SORRY SORRY ABOUT THAT SORRY ED 
GEMMA IT'S JUST AN OPTION YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT STRAIGHTAWAY 
YOU LOOK A LITTLE BIT SHOCKED YES 
THE ONE THING YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT STRAIGHT AWAY IS 
HOW MUCH YOU THINK THE HOUSE IS FOR SALE 
COME ON THIS WAY ED 
HELLO COME AND DO GUESS THE PRICE 
SO YOU LIKED THE HOUSE LIKED IT QUITE A LOT 
YEAH WE DID YEAH IS IT A PRINCESS'S DREAM

YOUR MAXIMUM BUDGET IS ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
GEMMA WOULD YOU LIKE TO GUESS FIRST OR SECOND 
I WOULD LIKE TO GUESS SECOND 
O. K. GRAHAM PRESSURE ON YOU 
I SAID OVER BEFORE AND THAT WAS WRONG 
SO I'M GOING TO GO UNDER AND SAY ONE HUNDRED TWO GOOD GUESS

I THINK IT'S PROBABLY ON THE MONEY I'M GOING TO GO ONE HUNDRED TEN 
CRAFTY 
THAT IS GREAT ISN'T IT IT'S STILL RAINING SHALL WE HEAD OFF

YOU'VE NOT YOU'VE NOT REVEALED THE PRICE 
I SENSE FOR A REASON 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW THE PRICE I'D QUITE LIKE TO KNOW THE PRICE 
IT'S THE PRINCESS'S DREAM I'M SENSING WE'RE OVER 
I'VE GONE OVER A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR BUDGET I REALLY HAVE 
ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT 
TWELVE MAYBE THE PRICE OF THE HOUSE IS ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
TEN THOUSAND GIVE OR TAKE OVER THE BUDGET 
I FELT IT WAS WORTH STRETCHING YOURSELF 
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE CONSERVATORY SHALL WE GO TO THE OLD WILD CARD 
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST GO 
FINE JUST GO THEN 
JUST LEAVE AND DON'T EXPECT ME TO FOLLOW 
I PROBABLY WON'T JOIN YOU 
ALL RIGHT I WILL 
SO FOR THE WILD CARD WE THOUGHT WE'D SHOW GEMMA AND GRAHAM 
A SORT OF PROPERTY THEY HAD DECIDED THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CONSIDER 
BUT WE WANT THEM TO THINK AGAIN 
THIS VICTORIAN TERRACE HAS BEEN MODERNISED THROUGHOUT 
BUT HAS KEPT LOTS OF THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERISTICS 
IT'S GOT LARGE BEDROOMS A LOUNGE DINING ROOM A NEW KITCHEN 
AND SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL OUT BACK 
THE WILD CARD THE WILD CARD GRAHAM AND GEMMA EVERYONE IS INTRIGUED 
AND THEY LOVE THE WILD CARD 
THERE SHE BLOWS AND SHE IS A LOVELY VICTORIAN TERRACE 
IT IS QUITE SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL 
AND GRAHAM I THINK THIS HOUSE MIGHT JUST TWEAK YOUR INTRIGUED NOSE 
BUT ALSO I THINK IT'S GOT THE CHARACTER THAT GEMMA'S GONNA LIKE 
AND THERE'S SHALL WE MENTION THE SPECIAL 
THE BIT OUT THE BACK GO ON THERE IS A SPECIAL TREAT OUT THE BACK 
SO FROM THE OUTSIDE 
IT LOOKS QUITE SMALL INSIDE 
BUT IT MIGHT OPEN UP WHEN WE GET IN THERE A BIT 
YEAH I'M NOTICING THAT PARKING ISN'T THE GREATEST AND THERE'S NO FRONT GARDEN 
LOADS OF CARS PARKED DOWN HERE YEAH EXACTLY 
ERM KRISTIAN ANY INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT THE AREA 
O. K. WHAT I NEED TO TELL YOU IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT POTENTIAL 
THIS IS A VERY SHREWD PURCHASE 
BECAUSE THE AREA IS BEING INVESTED IN HEAVILY LOTS OF REGENERATION 
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF POUNDS 
PERIOD PROPERTIES LIKE THIS ALWAYS SELL IT'S A GORGEOUS PROPERTY 
A LITTLE BIT OF DECORATIVE DETAILING UP THERE WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE 
LET'S FIND OUT GO INSIDE IT'S GORGEOUS 
CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING GO ON 
YOU MUST BE ABSOLUTELY SPENT THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL I'M EXHAUSTED 
I GAVE IT EVERYTHING I HAD 
IT WAS A SOLILOQUY OF ESTATE AGENT MEETS WORDSWORTH 
I THINK I'M GONNA GO AND BUY THAT I NEED TO GO AND SIT DOWN 
YOU SOLD THAT SO BEAUTIFULLY OUT THE FRONT 
I NEARLY WANTED TO BUY IT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT 
IT CAN'T CONTINUE TO GO SO WELL CAN IT 
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT 
I LIKE THAT LITTLE COVING ARCHWAY AS WELL THAT'S QUITE SWEET YEAH 
THIS MUST BE THE LIVING ROOM THEN 
UH CORNER SOFA THAT'S NICE I LIKE THAT 
WE WAS TALKING ABOUT HAVING A CORNER SOFA WEREN'T WE YEAH 
THERE THEY ARE I LIKE THAT SOFA 
I QUITE LIKE THE LAMINATE FLOOR AS WELL YEAH I LIKE THAT AS WELL 
EXCEPT IT MEANS THAT WHEN WE GET A WE GET A CAT IF 
YOU'LL HEAR IT RUNNING AROUND HOLD ON ONE SECOND 
THERE ARE TWO CATS CURRENTLY RESIDING AT THIS PROPERTY 
AND THEY DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM 
THE FELINES I'VE SPOKEN TO THEM THEY'RE QUITE HAPPY 
KRISTIAN'S PROBABLY GONNA SHOUT AT ME FOR SAYING THAT 
BUT I'M NOT THAT KEEN ON THAT EITHER 
DADO RAIL HALFWAY UP THE WALL I'M SURE THERE'S A POINT TO IT 
IT'S A FEATURE THAT YOU GET IN QUITE A LOT OF VICTORIAN HOUSES 
BUT I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF IT 
DADO RAILS ARE TO DO WITH PROPORTION AND 
CAN I GO AND HAVE A NOSE AT THE DADO RAIL 
GO ON DO YOU WANT ME TO HOLD THAT 
OH IT'S THE DINING ROOM I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE THE KITCHEN YEAH 
IT MUST GO FURTHER BACK THAN THAT I LIKE THAT 
BUT I'D MAYBE TURN THAT INTO A MOCK FIREPLACE 
YOU KNOW WITH FAKE WOOD CANDLES AND THAT SORT OF THING 
AGAIN WITH THE DADO RAILS HALFWAY UP THE WALL WHAT'S WITH THAT 
DADO RAILS ARE DOWN HERE SHE'S LOOKING AT THE PICTURE RAILS 
IT'S QUITE A MODERN KITCHEN ACTUALLY ISN'T IT YEAH IT'S NICE 
THERE'S LOADS OF CUPBOARDS THERE IS I LIKE THAT 
WHAT ABOUT THE FRIDGE 
FRIDGE ERM NON EXISTENT NO FRIDGE 
O. K. IS IT IN ONE OF THE CUPBOARDS OR SOMETHING 
OH NO THERE IS A FRIDGE 
SECRET FRIDGE FRIDGE INSIDE A CUPBOARD 
I DO QUITE LIKE FRIDGE INSIDE A CUPBOARD 
IT'S WEIRD THAT IT'S SORT OF INTEGRATED 
YOU'D HAVE TO GET A SPECIFIC SIZE TO GO DIRECTLY IN THERE 
RATHER THAN PUTTING OUR FRIDGE IN WOULDN'T WE 
I DON'T THINK SHE REALISES THAT AN INTEGRATED FRIDGE WILL MORE THAN LIKELY COME WITH THE PROPERTY 
I DON'T THINK THERE'LL BE RIPPING OUT THE UNITS TO TAKE THAT WITH THEM 
YOU REALLY NOTICE HOW HIGH THE CEILINGS ARE DON'T YOU 
COMING UP HERE YES 
IT'S REALLY HIGH IT'S QUITE STEEP STAIRS AS WELL ISN'T IT 
BUT THE CEILINGS ARE VERY HIGH OH WOW THAT'S A BIG BEDROOM 
THAT'S BIG ISN'T IT YEAH IT IS IT'S MASSIVE 
AND THERE'S A FIREPLACE HERE 
THAT'S REALLY NICE THAT'S VERY CLASSICAL ISN'T IT 
AH YES YES YES 
IT'S QUITE A SMALL WINDOW 
THERE'S A LOT OF WALL EITHER SIDE YEAH 
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS BEDROOM MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXTENDED 
BUT IT CAN'T HAVE BEEN 
IT'S NOT THE WORLD'S LARGEST WINDOW BUT IT STILL LIGHTS THAT ROOM UP 
AND IF YOU WANT TO BREAK THE VASTNESS OF A WALL UP THEN DO IT WITH SOME 
POP A MIRROR THERE POP A MIRROR THERE NO 
THAT'S WHAT HE'S ABOUT TO SAY 
I WAS GOING TO SAY SOME VERY WELL CHOSEN ARTWORK 
IT'S BIGGER THAN I WAS EXPECTING 
YEAH YEAH ME TOO IT IS A REALLY GOOD SIZE 
AND IT'S GOT A NICE FIREPLACE 
HAVE YOU GONE IN THERE AND TURNED THEIR FROWNS UPSIDE DOWN 
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'VE DONE THAT IT'S HAPPENED 
THIS MUST BE BEDROOM NUMERO TWO 
AGAIN IT'S QUITE A BIG BEDROOM 
YOU'D DEFINITELY GET A SOFA BED IN THERE 
YOU'D PROBABLY GET YOUR POLE UP IN HERE 
YEAH IF YOU PUT THE SOFA BED PUSHED AGAINST THAT CORNER 
AND THEN THE POLE HERE 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE GOT THE COMPUTERS DOWNSTAIRS YEAH 
SIZE WISE THAT WOULD BE FINE WOULDN'T IT 
IT'S ONLY TWO BEDROOMS NOT THREE BEDROOMS BUT THE TWO BEDROOMS ARE VERY BIG TWO BEDROOMS 
AND EQUATE TO THE BEDROOMS OF THE OTHER PROPERTIES 
BUT THESE TWO BEDROOMS I THINK ARE SUPERB 
WITH THE COMPUTER ROOM THERE THEY DON'T NEED THREE BEDROOMS AND THIS BIT 
I LIKE THE TILES YEAH I DO AS WELL ACTUALLY THAT'S A REALLY NICE BATHROOM PROBABLY THE BIGGEST 
OH THOSE TILES IN THE BATHROOM THEY'RE ALMOST VERSA TILE THEY ARE 
THEY TOOK THE MICK OUT OF ME FOR HAVING PLANTS IN THE BATHROOM AND THERE'S ONE 
YES A PLANT IN THE BATHROOM IS ONE THING A HERB GARDEN IS ANOTHER STORY 
IT LOOKS NICE WITH THE RED IN HERE AS WELL 
THIS IS WHAT I WAS THINKING WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY NATURIST BATHROOM 
A NATURIST BATHROOM WE'RE HAVING SOME NUDITY UP THERE 
I GUESS YOU'D HAVE TO YOU TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF TO GET IN THE BATH 
UNLESS YOUR SUITS ARE DRIP DRY 
YOU PROBABLY WOULD OF ALL THE ROOMS PROBABLY THE BATHROOM 
YEAH I WAS THINKING SORT OF CREAM AND COLOURS LIKE THIS AND THEN 
LIKE THEY'VE GOT THE RED ACCENTS BUT WITH GREEN ACCENTS AND MINT 
IT'S ACTUALLY A PLEASANT SURPRISE THIS BATHROOM 
I THINK WE'RE GOING LIKE THIS WITH THIS PROPERTY THEY'RE UNDECIDED 
IT'S IN THE BALANCE ISN'T IT LET'S LEVEL IT UP ALL RIGHT 
GEMMA AND GRAHAM AT THE TOP OF THE SHOP I DID MENTION THE TREAT IN THE BACK GARDEN DID I NOT YES 
NOW THERE IS NO THIRD BEDROOM 
YEAH THERE IS NO GARAGE BUT THERE'S BEEN NO GARAGE SO FAR YEAH 
BUT BEHIND HERE COULD BE THE POLE DANCING FACILITY OF YOUR DREAMS

O. K. GEMMA AND GRAHAM YOU'VE SEEN THIS PROPERTY AND THE POLE DANCING SHED

BECAUSE IT'S GOT A SLOPED CEILING AS STORAGE IT'S FANTASTIC 
WHAT WE NEED YOU TO DO NOW IS GUESS THE PRICE

IT'S LOVELY N'EST PAS 
YES BUT YOU'VE ONE MORE THING TO DO KRISTIAN AND I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT 
WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHICH ONE YOU DO ACTUALLY LIKE TO TEST DRIVE AND IT'S A BIG DECISION 
IT'S A MASSIVE DECISION GO AWAY FINGERS CROSSED TAKE A PACKED LUNCH IF YOU NEED IT 
MAYBE YOU MIGHT NEED A DOG WITH SOME BRANDY ROUND HIS NECK TO REVIVE YOU

ARE YOU READY YES GOOD LUCK TAKE CARE 
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER

AND THREE HUGE BEDROOMS ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
OR WILL MY PLACE PIP IT TO THE POST 
THIS STYLISHLY DECORATED HOUSE WITH A CONSERVATORY 
PLUS A PRINCESS BEDROOM JUST FOR GEMMA 
SLIGHTLY OVER BUDGET AT ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY 
OR WILL THEY WIGGLE THEIR WAY TO THE WILD CARD 
A VICTORIAN TERRACE WITH CHARACTER 
AND MODERN TASTEFUL DECORATION AND HAS AN EXTRA ROOM IN THE GARDEN 
IT'S UNDER THEIR BUDGET 
GRAHAM AND GEMMA YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE TO TEST DRIVE MY HOUSE AND I'M SEETHING ABOUT THAT

CHOOSE WHATEVER YOU THINK'S BEST 
YEAH THE MONEY IT WAS SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES YEAH 
YOURS WAS A LOT OVER BUDGET AND THIS ONE ALMOST AS MUCH UNDER BUDGET 
GOOD WITH IT BEING A VICTORIAN HOUSE WE THOUGHT THAT WE'D GET A LOT OUT OF THE SURVEYOR FROM THIS 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE ATTIC CONVERSION AND WHETHER THAT WAS A POSSIBILITY 
AND THE LITTLE ROOM AT THE BACK WE WERE THINKING ABOUT MAYBE EXTENDING IT UPWARDS 
WE'VE HAD A TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY SURVEYOR HERE YES 
I MUST STRESS IT IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING BUT HE WENT ROUND THERE 
ERM YES POTENTIAL FOR ATTIC UP THERE PERFECT IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
OUT THE BACK HE THINKS IT NEEDS A LOT MORE LOOKING INTO PLANNING PERMISSION ALSO DAMP COURSE 
NOW THE PATH OUTSIDE IS ABOVE THE ACTUAL FLOORING INSIDE THE HOUSE 
SO YOU MIGHT GET WATER INGRESS YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE GOT A DAMP COURSE IN THERE YES 
THE OTHER THING YOU'VE GOT IS YOUR BRICKS ARE VERY OLD AND THEY'RE STARTING TO SHOW SIGNS OF PERISHING 
SOME NEED TO BE REPLACED RIGHT 
FACE THEM UP AGAIN THEY NEED TO BE COATED AND TREATED 
SIMPLE AS THAT IT'S NOT A BIG JOB SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
