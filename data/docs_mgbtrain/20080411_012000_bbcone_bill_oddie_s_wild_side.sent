COMING UP I ATTEMPT TO LISTEN TO MY INNER TREE 
I CAN'T HEAR A THING 
LONDON IS INVADED BY A MYSTERIOUS FORM OF POND LIFE 
AND MY GARDEN IS THE SCENE OF A MURDER MYSTERY 
FIRST JOHN AITCHISON'S TRICKY CHALLENGE 
SO WHAT AM I DOING IN A DEEP DARK 
AND SO FAR APPARENTLY LIFELESS PINE FOREST 
WELL I'M HOPING TO SEE SOMETHING THAT BELIEVE ME OVER MY LIFE I HAVE TRIED TO SEE MANY MANY MANY TIMES 
BUT SO FAR ALL I'VE HAD IS THE MEREST GLIMPSE 
ACTUALLY THERE IS NO SHAME IN NOT HAVING SEEN A GOSHAWK 
BECAUSE THEY DO NEST AND HUNT IN THESE THICK THICK FORESTS 
AND THEY'RE VERY VERY SECRETIVE 
IN FACT JUST ABOUT THE ONLY TIME THAT GOSHAWKS CAN BE CONSPICUOUS 
IS WHEN THEY'RE DOING THEIR DISPLAY FLIGHT 
BUT OF COURSE THAT ONLY HAPPENS ON LOVELY SUNNY DAYS IN EARLY SPRING 
LIKE THIS ONE 
AND IT'S THAT DISPLAY FLIGHT THAT I WANT JOHN TO TRY AND FILM 
HE DOES ONLY HAVE ONE DAY TO DO IT IN THOUGH 
NEVERTHELESS LET'S BE OPTIMISTIC 
THE WEATHER IS PERFECT 
HE'S READY TO GO WITH HIS GREAT BIG LENS 
WELL NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE IS IT 
TELL ME THEN HOW MANY GOSHAWKS HAVE YOU ACTUALLY SEEN IN YOUR LIFETIME 
I'VE SEEN CHICKS BEING RINGED THAT DOESN'T COUNT I DON'T THINK ACTUALLY FLYING 
I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE THAT I WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN WAS A GOSHAWK THEY'RE LIKE GHOSTS 
EXACTLY BUT JUST TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT SPICIER FOR YOU 
WE'VE SET YOU UP WITHIN ABOUT HALF A MILE 
OF A LIVE FIRING RANGE SO 
BUT THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE COS IN THOSE TREES 
THERE IS A GOSHAWK NESTING BUT WE CAN'T GET ANY CLOSER THAN THIS 
THERE'S NO TRICK TO THIS IS THERE 
NO I THINK IT'S JUST STAND AND WAIT AND LOOK ISN'T IT 
OW 
YOU DO START TO GET HYSTERICAL 
YES IT'S NORMAL 
I'VE GOT AN OLD BIRD WATCHING FRIEND WHO DIVIDES BIRDERS INTO TWO TYPES 
PEOPLE WHO STICK AROUND AND WAIT AND THE OTHERS WHO GO SEARCHING 
THEY ARE THE ARSERS 
AND THE LEGGERS 
I'M GONNA BE A LEGGER I CAN SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING COS I'M GONNA LEG IT 
I WON'T GO ANY FURTHER BUT YOU'RE STAYING HERE PUT IT THAT WAY 
JUST DON'T TELL ME IF YOU SEE THEM 
I BLOODY WILL 
YOU'LL HEAR THE CHEER FROM THE DISTANCE 
NOW NORMALLY I JUST POP OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE COMPLETELY AND LEAVE JOHN TO GET ON WITH THESE THINGS 
BUT THIS TIME I'M GONNA STICK AROUND 
BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE GOSHAWKS JUST AS MUCH AS JOHN WANTS TO FILM THEM 
NATURALLY I DO APPRECIATE THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE CAMERAMAN 
BECAUSE WELL I'VE BEEN WIELDING MY CAMCORDER MYSELF 
MIND YOU IT'S IN RATHER MORE INTIMATE CONDITIONS IN MY GARDEN 
AND WHAT'S MORE THE BIRDS ARE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE CO OPERATIVE 
JUST ABOUT EVERY TIME I POP MY HEAD OUT OF THE BACK DOOR 
WITHIN SECONDS I CAN HEAR A WREN SINGING 
BUT WRENS HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY NESTED IN MY GARDEN UNTIL THIS YEAR 
AND JUST LIKE BUSES NONE FOR AGES 
THEN THREE COME ALONG AT THE SAME TIME 
ACTUALLY THREE NESTS BECAUSE THE FACT IS 
ALL THREE WERE PROBABLY BUILT BY THE SAME BIRD I'LL EXPLAIN 
MALE WRENS BUILD SEVERAL NESTS 
THEY'RE REFERRED TO AS COCK'S NESTS 
AND IT MEANS THE FEMALES HAVE GOT A CHOICE 
NEST NUMBER ONE I REALLY LIKED 
I MEAN HOW'S THIS FOR A NOVEL LOCATION 
INSIDE A FAIRY TREE SURROUNDED BY WIND CHIMES 
PLASTIC SPIDERS FAKE SNAKES AND A RUBBER BAT 
WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK 
QUITE A BIT MORE APPARENTLY 
BECAUSE MRS. WREN TURNED HER BEAK UP AT IT 
O. K. THEN FROM THE RIDICULOUS TO THE SUBLIME 
WELL I'D CALL IT DULL BUT ANYWAY THERE WE ARE 
THERE IT WAS ON THE WILLOW TREE A NORMAL NEST BOX 
AND MR. WREN WORKED VERY HARD MAKING IT NICE AND COSY 
DID SHE CARE NO SHE WAS TOO BUSY EATING MEALWORMS ON A BADGER 
ANYWAY ON TO NEST NUMBER THREE 
TUCKED AWAY BEHIND A DRAINPIPE 
FAIRLY HIGH UP IN A HOLE IN THE WALL 
AND IT WAS SURROUNDED BY RATHER HANDY MOSS 
WHICH IS A SURE SIGN THAT THE PIPE WAS LEAKING 
SO I'D BETTER GET THAT FIXED 
AND WHAT DID SHE THINK OF THIS ONE 
I WAS PRETTY SURE THAT THIS NEST WAS BEING USED 
BUT THEN IT WENT OMINOUSLY QUIET 
SO I DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE 
OW 
AND SOMETHING PECKED ME 
BABY 
A BABY WREN SURELY NOT 
OH NO THIS WAS BAD NEWS 
I HADN'T BEEN PECKED I'D BEEN BITTEN 
BY MAYBE A MOUSE 
POSSIBLY EVEN A RAT FEEDING ON THE EGGS 
AND THE NEWLY HATCHED YOUNGSTERS 
I KNOW THIS IS THE WAY NATURE WORKS BUT I WAS VERY SAD ABOUT IT 
SO WAS THAT IT 
THREE NESTS BUILT BUT NO WREN FAMILY RAISED 
BUT A FEW WEEKS LATER 
I SUDDENLY HEARD THE DISTINCTIVE NOISES OF WRENS BY THE WILLOW TREE 
AND I NOTICED SOMETHING TO WARM MY HEART 
POO FROM NEST BOX NUMBER TWO 
THAT'S APPROPRIATE ISN'T IT 
NUMBER TWOS FROM NUMBER TWO 
I FELT PARTICULARLY PLEASED FOR THE MALE WREN 
ALL THAT WORK IT HADN'T BEEN WASTED 
AND I WAS ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED 
THAT WHATEVER GOT THE DRAINPIPE FAMILY 
WAS NOT GOING TO GET THIS LOT 
I EVEN DECIDED TO GIVE MRS. WREN A HELPING HAND PROVIDING MEALWORMS 
COS LET'S FACE IT MALE WRENS ARE NOT GONNA HELP MUCH 
NO YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH I'LL PUT SOME MORE OUT LATER 
AND I TRANSFORMED A HANGING BASKET INTO NEST BOX SECURITY FENCE 
HA HA THAT'S FOILED YOU HASN'T IT MATE 
BUT THEN I HAD TO GO AWAY FOR A WEEK 
I LEFT A FINAL MEAL 
AND I WAS SURE THAT I'D BE BACK 
TO SEE THEM LEAVE THE NEST OR WOULD I 
WELL LIKE ME YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT TILL LATER TO FIND OUT 
MEANWHILE A MUSICAL INTERLUDE 
BIRDSONG NATURE'S MUSIC 
WELL SURELY IT MUST ORIGINALLY HAVE BEEN THE INSPIRATION FOR MAN MAKING MUSIC 
BUT HOW MUSICAL IS BIRDSONG AND DOES THINKING OF IT IN MUSICAL TERMS 
ACTUALLY HELP US TO DISTINGUISH ONE SONG FROM ANOTHER 
I THINK IT DOES 
I RECKON THAT YOU CAN DIVIDE SONGBIRDS UP INTO THOSE THAT ARE CLASSICAL MUSICIANS 
AND THOSE THAT ARE JAZZ MUSICIANS 
AND WHAT I MEANT BY THAT IS THERE ARE THOSE THAT STICK TO THE TUNE 
AND THERE ARE OTHERS THAT EMBELLISH IT OR INDEED IMPROVISE SO THAT A TUNE VIRTUALLY DISAPPEARS 
ALLOW ME TO ELUCIDATE 
BY WHICH I MEAN SIT DOWN AND WHIP OUT MY WHISTLE THERE YOU GO 
LET'S TAKE A TUNE CALLED I'M SURE YOU KNOW IT I GOT RHYTHM 
YOU CAN PLAY IT ABSOLUTELY STRAIGHT 
I GOT RHYTHM 
OR I CAN IMPROVISE AND YOU WON'T RECOGNISE THE TUNE AT ALL 
SOMETHING LIKE 
OF COURSE THE BIRDS DON'T DO I GOT RHYTHM 
BUT LET'S GO AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY DO DO AND HOW THEY DO IT 
SO SOME BIRDS SING EXACTLY THE SAME SONG EVERY TIME 
CALL IT THE CLASSICAL APPROACH STICKING TO THE SCORE 
FOR EXAMPLE CHIFFCHAFF 
CHIFF CHAFF CHIFF CHAFF NOT EXACTLY AN INSPIRING ANTHEM BUT IT'S CONSISTENT 
THEN THERE ARE THOSE THAT STICK TO THE TUNE BUT A LITTLE EMBELLISHMENT 
LIKE THAT BIRD THAT JUST SUNG 
CHAFFINCH THERE'S ALWAYS THE SAME SHAPE TO IT 
IT'S BASICALLY SORT OF D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. DIDDLY DUM 
AND THEN THERE ARE THE IMPROVISERS THE FULLY FLEDGED JAZZERS 
THESE BIRDS PROBABLY NEVER SING EXACTLY THE SAME SONG TWICE 
JUST LIKE A JAZZ MUSICIAN DOESN'T PLAY THE SAME SOLO TWICE 
BUT HE DOES HAVE A CONSISTENT TONE 
ALL JAZZ MUSICIANS STRIVE FOR THAT A DISTINCTIVE TONE 
AND BIRDS HAVE GOT IT TOO 
FOR EXAMPLE ROBIN WHAT'S THE WORD 
I THINK WISPY A WISPY TONE 
BLACKBIRD THEY OFTEN TALK ABOUT BLACKBIRD HAVING A FLUTY VOICE 
I THINK THAT FRUITY IS BETTER 
IT'S GOT WHOOM LOTS OF BODY TO IT 
AH NOW A SONG THRUSH LOVELY PURE TONE 
BUT THIS REALLY IS LIKE A JAZZ MUSICIAN 
PRACTISING ALL HIS FAVOURITE LITTLE PHRASES 
DEFINITELY GOT RHYTHM TOO HAVEN'T THEY 
THAT'S LOVELY DUH DIDDLY YOO DUH DIDDLY YOO 
THAT BENDING OF NOTES THAT'S DEFINITELY MORE RELATED TO FOLK MUSIC BLUES JAZZ 
I'M NOT SAYING THEY LISTEN TO THAT I'M SAYING IT'S THE OTHER WAY ROUND REALLY 
JAZZ ACCOMPANIMENT 
BUT AM I JUST BEING FANCIFUL 
I MEAN IS THERE REALLY ANY POINT IN LISTENING TO BIRDSONG IN A MUSICAL WAY 
WELL I MOST DEFINITELY THINK THERE IS BECAUSE APART FROM ANYTHING ELSE 
IT'S GONNA HELP YOU APPRECIATE THE VAST RANGE OF BIRDSONG 
AND IT'LL ALSO MAKE YOU LISTEN 
AND IT'S ONLY BY LISTENING THAT YOU LEARN 
AND EVENTUALLY I'M ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED YOU WILL LEARN TO TELL ONE BIRD FROM ANOTHER 
THERE'S NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT MANY ARTISTS HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY NATURE 
BE THEY MUSICIANS POETS PAINTERS OR SCULPTORS 
FOR EXAMPLE TONY HEYWOOD 
NOW HIS WORK IS COLOURFUL AND SHAPELY BUT IS IT ART 
OR IS IT NATURE 
WOW GREAT COLOURS 
WHAT THE HELL IS IT 
IT IS SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE ABSTRACT 
ABSTRACT YES BUT WHAT IS IT 
I WAS QUITE INSPIRED BY LOOKING AT IMAGES UNDER A MICROSCOPE RIGHT OF POND LIFE 
AH SINGLE CELL ALGAE 
THE MORE I READ ABOUT THEM THE MORE FANTASTIC THEY SEEMED 
I THOUGHT HOW ABOUT TRYING TO WORK WITH A SCULPTURE 
THAT WOULD BEHAVE AND REFLECT THE ACTUAL BIOLOGY OF THE ORGANISM THAT I WAS LOOKING AT 
THERE IS A SENSE OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM THEY DO LOOK QUITE ORGANIC 
THEY MOVE TOGETHER THEY COALESCE TOGETHER AND I WANTED THE SCULPTURE TO WORK LIKE THAT RIGHT 
THEY'RE NOT EXACT REPRESENTATIONS OR ANYTHING THESE T. H. A T. S. OBVI OU S. 
THEY'RE ALMOST PARODIES OF NATURE IN A WAY AREN'T THEY 
AND I THINK THEY'RE SORT OF BLOWN UP TO A KITSCH THING 
I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT 
THEY DID REMIND ME OF STUFF ALMOST OUT OF FIFTIES AND SIXTIES SCI FI MOVIES 
ALMOST LIKE SOME INSANE HYBRID FROM ANOTHER PLANET 
AND THAT TO ME WORKED QUITE WELL 
BUT IT'S A BIT OF AN ASSUMPTION AS TO WHAT IS ON ANOTHER PLANET 
WELL THAT YES YEAH IT IS 
BUT THAT GIVES ME HUGE A GREAT RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES 
WE COME IN PEACE 
COME IN PIECES THEY'RE VERY 
BUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM IS THE REVERSE OF WHAT THEY ARE IN NATURE 
THEY'RE BIGGER YOU KNOW RIDICULOUS SIZE 
AND THEY'RE ALMOST PUMPED UP SUPER NATURE IN A WAY AND THAT APPEALS TO ME 
WELL I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ART BUT I KNOW WHAT I LIKE AND I RATHER LIKE THESE 
I THINK THEY'D LOOK QUITE GOOD IN MY GARDEN 
SO BILL WHAT IS YOUR GARDEN LIKE AS 
MY WIFE HAS D'YOU HAVE ONE I HAVE A WIFE YEAH 
I ALSO HAVE A GARDEN BUT YES MY WIFE CALLS IT LUDICROUS 
YEAH WELL LUDICROUS IT MAY BE BUT MR. AND MRS. WREN LIKE IT 
THEY FIND IT RATHER HOMELY AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE IT EITHER 
BECAUSE AFTER ONE TRAGEDY THEY TRIED AGAIN 
AND I WAS DETERMINED 
THAT THIS TIME THEY WERE GONNA BE O. K. 
IN FACT I WAS REALLY A BIT WORRIED FOR THEM 
WHEN I HAD TO GO AWAY FOR THAT WEEK 
AND THE FIRST THING I DID WHEN I GOT BACK 
WAS TO RUSH OUT INTO THE GARDEN 
AND SEE HOW THE C. H. 
UH OH 
NO HAVE A LITTLE TAP 
THIS BOX IS DEFINITELY EMPTY 
OH WAS IT YOU YOU LOOK GUILTY 
IT WASN'T YOU 
IT MIGHT BE YOU 
OR HIM 
ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT HAVE FLEDGED SAFELY 
AND IF THEY HAVE THEY'LL BE HIDDEN AWAY SOMEWHERE 
IN A DARK PART OF THE GARDEN 
NOTHING 
OOH YES 
YES THAT'S ONE OF THEM 
DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM 
AND OH TWO AND MUM 
OH MY BABIES WELL HER BABIES I SUPPOSE BUT ANYWAY 
OH I DO LIKE A HAPPY ENDING 
I TALK TO THE TREE 
BUT OF COURSE I DON'T EXPECT A REPLY 
BUT MAYBE I SHOULD COS APPARENTLY SOME TREES CAN BE VERY VERY NOISY 
OR PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY THEY ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING SOME EXTRAORDINARY SOUNDS 
WHICH IS WHY EXTRAORDINARY SOUND MAN MR. CHRIS WATSON IS EVEN NOW RISKING LIFE AND LIMB 
TO SET UP MICROPHONES IN ORDER TO RECORD A PARTICULARLY TALENTED OAK 
SO HOW DO I GET MY RIGHT HAND UP AGAIN 
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING CHRIS THAT IS ONE HANDSOME TREE ISN'T IT 
IT SHOULD BE IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS 
YOU EXPECT IT TO SORT OF MARCH TOWARDS US ANY MINUTE 
THIS TREE IS FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHICH IS ACTUALLY ONLY MIDDLE AGED 
FOR AN OAK TREE BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MUST HAVE SEEN EH 
EH IF ONLY IT COULD TALK WHAT WOULD IT HAVE TO SAY 
LET ME JUST HAVE A LISTEN 
OOH CAN YOU HEAR THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOME KIND OF AN ALARM CALL 
OOH THAT SOUNDS LIKE A WOODPECKER 
A GREAT SPOTTED WOODPECKER YEAH 
THIS IS A NEW SENSATION CHRIS HAVING A WOODPECKER IN ME HEAD 
YOU GET THAT REAL SENSE THE WHOLE THING'S ALIVE 
AND I CAN HEAR WOOD PIGEON JACKDAW THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT IN THE TREE 
BUT IN THE TREE I'M SURE THERE'S BLUE TITS GREAT TITS YEAH 
OCCASIONAL CHAFFINCH NUTHATCH SOMETIMES 
SO IT'S RATHER LIKE HAVING A PAIR OF EARS UP THERE SIXTY FEET UP 
I'M ALWAYS AMAZED BY CHRIS'S DEDICATION 
OR SHOULD IT BE OBSESSION COS AFTER ALL HE'S BEEN HERE ALL DAY 
AND HE WAS HERE AGAIN AT NIGHT 
I WANTED TO HEAR HOW THE SOUNDS OF THIS TREE CHANGED 
THROUGH NIGHT AND ACROSS DAWN AND INTO TODAY YEAH 
SO I CAME OUT WHILE IT WAS STILL NIGHT 
O. K. THEN FOLKS AT HOME LET'S HAVE A LISTEN SHALL WE 
THERE'S A FEW THINGS I'D LIKE YOU TO HEAR LIKE THIS ONE 
OH TAWNY OWL 
DID YOU GET IT 
O. K. AND WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE 
WELL IF I WAS IN CALIFORNIA I'D SAY IT WAS A SEA LION 
BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF OXFORDSHIRE 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY FALLOW DEER 
I THINK THAT MUST BE A DEER YES IT'S A SORT OF STRANGE ALMOST COUGHING SOUND 
UGH UGH UGH 
AS THINGS PROGRESSED WHAT HAPPENED WAS WE ACTUALLY GOT A COUPLE OF VISITORS TO THE TREE 
AND PAST OUR MICROPHONES AND THIS IS FANTASTIC BECAUSE IT'S A BIRD'S EAR POSITION 
OH YEAH 
LOVELY 
NOW WATCH THAT FOLKS AT HOME 
JUST WAIT 
THAT'S GREAT THAT WAS KESTREL YEAH COMING FROM DISTANCE 
THERE'S YOUR MICROPHONE AND GOING FLAP FLAP FLAP KEEK KEEK KEEK KEEK KEEK KEEK KEEK KEE KEEK KEEK 
WHEN I FINALLY FINISHED I WENT UP THERE WITH MY ULTRASOUND DETECTOR 
AND POINTED IT UP INTO THE CANOPY BUT LISTEN TO THIS 
THAT IS GREAT THAT'S BATS PROBABLY PIPISTRELLES A LITTLE ONE 
IT'S WHEN THEY'RE CHASING PREY AND PUTTING OUT ECHO LOCATION CALLS RECEIVING THEM BACK 
AND AS THEY GET NEARER AND THEY'RE HOMING IN IT GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER 
THE SIGNALS THEY GET MORE RAPID 
BUT THEN THERE'S THIS OMINOUS FEW SECONDS OF SILENCE 
WHERE THEY SCOOP UP THE PREY EAT AND THEN START AGAIN 
I'VE LOST CONTACT WITH REALITY SO HAVE I 
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE LISTENING TO WHERE ARE WE ARE WE ALIVE 
HAVE WE TURNED INTO TREES 
OH CHRIS MY HEAD HURTS 
O. K. THEN LET'S GET THIS SORTED OUT 
THOSE WERE SOUNDS AROUND AND ON THE TREE 
BUT WHAT ABOUT WITHIN THE TREE 
I SHOULD HAVE GONE ON THAT DIET 
MANY GO INTO THIS TREE AND VERY FEW RETURN 
WOW THAT'S FANTASTIC IT'S GOT FACES 
WHAT'S THAT PAINTING THE SCREAM YEAH 
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS RECORD THE ACOUSTIC SOUNDS INSIDE THIS TREE YOU KNOW WITH THESE LITTLE MICROPHONES 
I CAN'T HEAR A THING 
AT SOME STAGE THIS TREE IS GONNA KEEL OVER ISN'T IT I PRESUME 
HOPEFULLY NOT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS NO NO 
OOH 
I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING A TREE FOR A WALK 
COME ON COME ON 
MY GOODNESS 
THE CHOMPING OF A THOUSAND TINY JAWS 
BUT WHAT IS IT THAT'S BUSY GORGING AWAY IN THERE 
IS IT ONE BIG THING OR MILLIONS OF SOME LITTLE THINGS 
GOOD GRIEF SO THAT IS AS THEY SAY RIDDLED WITH BEETLES YEAH LARVAE AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
THAT'S THE SOUND OF THIS TREE'S EVENTUAL DECAY AND DESTRUCTION FROM THE INSIDE 
WOW 
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY 
WELL THERE'S AN IDEA 
INSTEAD OF JUST GOING FOR A WALK IN THE WOODS 
SIT AND LISTEN TO THEM 
SEE THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT TREES THEY JUST STAY IN ONE PLACE AND YOU REALLY CAN'T MISS THEM 
UNLIKE GOSHAWKS 
AH JOHN HELLO BILL 
I HAVE SEEN NOTHING AND I DON'T JUST MEAN NO GOSHAWKS 
I MEAN NO BIRDS WHATSOEVER 
I'M SORRY SO HOW'VE YOU GOT ON OH WOODLARKS 
WE HAD TWO WOODLARKS SHOWING OFF THEIR CRESTS IN AMONG THESE LITTLE TREES 
OH I LIKE WOODLARKS WOODLARKS ARE VERY LOVELY LITTLE BIRDS 
ALL RIGHT HERE IS THE QUESTION THE BIG QUESTION THE MOMENT OF TRUTH 
ANY GOSHAWKS 
WELL YES BUT YES BAD LUCK YES YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED BUT NOT VERY CLOSE 
MILES AND MILES AND MILES AWAY 
I DON'T THINK THEY EXIST YOU WERE HALLUCINATING YOU'VE MADE IT UP GHOST HAWKS 
UNTIL I SEE THOSE PICTURES I BELIEVE NOTHING 
THERE WAS ONE MALE YEAH 
JUST SOARING AND GLIDING VERY ROUNDED WINGS 
AND I THINK HE'D BEEN EATING HE HAD A VERY FULL CROP I THINK YOU COULD SEE THAT 
IT'S SMALL BUT A BULGE IN HIS THROAT 
CAN'T HAVE BEEN A BAD VIEW 
SO THESE ARE PROBABLY WOOD PIGEONS 
IT'S PROBABLY FULL OF PIGEON YEAH 
THE OTHER ONE A FEMALE CAME ACROSS THE TREES 
AND IT WAS A LONG WAY AWAY BUT SHE WENT CIRCLING UP A LITTLE BIT 
SO IN SIGHT FOR A WHILE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST VIEW I'D EVER HAD 
WELL SHE HAD WHITE FLASHES ON HER SIDE OH THAT'S RIGHT 
I THINK THEY CALL THAT THE CHRISOMS OR SOMETHING 
IT ISN'T ACTUALLY IT LOOKS LIKE A WHITE RUMP YES 
SO IT WAS ALMOST DISPLAYING MAYBE NOT QUITE 
COME ON JOHN YOU DID SEE THEM WHICH IS MORE THAN I DID 
OH DEAR THERE ARE TIMES I HATE BIRDS 
ANYWAY HERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR YOU AT HOME A VIEW OF A GOSHAWK WHICH YOU WILL NEVER EVER GET 
UNLESS IT'S A TAME ONE IN A NATURAL HISTORY FILM 
NEXT TIME JOHN AITCHISON'S CHALLENGE IS DEFINITELY NOT EASY 
DOLPHINS ATTEMPT TO MAKE CONTACT WITH SOUND MAN CHRIS WATSON 
AND I OBSERVE THE DELIGHTS OF AN AVIAN KAMA SUTRA 
THESE ARE NO ORDINARY KIDS 
THEY'RE SUPERKIDS GENETICALLY DESIGNED TO BEAT ADULTS 
JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN I'VE GOT QUITE A LOT STORED UP HERE 
I'M TWENTY SIX HE'S THIRTEEN SO ACCORDING TO ME HE'S HALF AS INTELLIGENT 
YOU WANNA FIND OUT WHO WINS 
JOIN US AND SEE IF THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT 
WE'RE IN POMPEII AND IT'S VOLCANO DAY 
YOU SAVE PEOPLE NOT THIS TIME 
SHOW YOURSELF I MUST MAKE THE MOST TERRIBLE CHOICE 
DONNA DOCTOR
