THANK YOU THANK YOU 
THANK YOU 
THANK YOU SO MUCH HELLO AND WELCOME TO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
FASCINATING HOMES OWNED BY FASCINATING PERSONALITIES 
THEY'RE THE KEYS TO TODAY'S ENTERTAINMENT 
AND THE KEY HOLDER AS ALWAYS IS THE LOVELY LISA SNOWDON 
LET ME MAKE YOU AN OFFER YOU CAN'T REFUSE 
NO NOT FROM THE GODFATHER 
O. K. SO IT'S AN ITALIAN THING 
BUT CAN PASTA BE ROMANTIC 
IT DEPENDS ON WHO'S DISHING IT UP 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS HOME 
I HOPE TO FIND A SECRET DIARY PERHAPS 
BUT THEN AGAIN MAYBE I'LL SETTLE FOR A DECENT CUP OF COFFEE 
THE CLUES ARE ALL THERE 
BUT WHO'S PLAYING THE GAME TODAY 
WELL LISA PLAYING THE GAME TODAY IS OUR PANEL 
AND WHAT A PANEL THEY ARE 
THEY'RE LIKE BALLET DANCERS 
USUALLY FOUND GRIPPING A BAR 
AN ANTIQUES EXPERT OUR FIRST PANELLIST WAS QUICK TO SPOT 
THAT A TUDOR WARMING PAN WAS IN FACT A FAKE 
HE SAYS TO THE TRAINED EYE IT WAS EASY 
IT SHOULD HAVE HAD A THREE PIN PLUG ON IT INSTEAD OF A TWO 
WILL YOU WELCOME WELL SPOTTED PAUL MARTIN THANK YOU 
OUR NEXT GUEST SAID TO HER FUTURE HUSBAND 
WHEN WE'RE MARRIED I WANT TO SHARE ALL YOUR TROUBLES AND WORRIES 
AND HE SAID I HAVEN'T GOT ANY TROUBLE AND WORRIES 
AND SHE SAID WE'RE NOT MARRIED YET 
WILL YOU WELCOME THE IN FACT HAPPILY MARRIED DEBRA STEPHENSON 
TUNE INTO B. B. C. BREAKFAST MOST MORNINGS 
AND YOU'LL FIND A MAN WHO'S CHARMING URBANE WITTY AND INCISIVE 
AND CHANCES ARE HE'S BEING INTERVIEWED BY BILL TURNBULL 
SO LET'S FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GAME 
LISA SNOWDON WILL BE TURNING THE LOCKS AND PUSHING OPEN THE DOORS ON TWO INTERESTING PROPERTIES 
FROM THE CLUES SHE OFFERS UP ALL OUR PANEL HAVE TO DO IS GUESS WHO WOULD LIVE IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
NOT ALWAYS A SIMPLE TASK BUT MADE EASIER WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF OUR AUDIENCE HERE IN THE STUDIO 
LET'S GO STRAIGHTAWAY TO HOUSE NUMBER ONE 
AND REMEMBER WATCH CLOSELY BECAUSE THE CLUES ARE THERE AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
I'M IN ELSTREE JUST OUTSIDE LONDON AND IT'S THE HOME OF THE BRITISH FILM INDUSTRY 
BUT WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR STARS OF THE SILVER SCREEN TODAY 
ALTHOUGH THE PERSON WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS CERTAINLY HOT 
THIS HOUSE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS 
AND YOU'LL SEE AS WE GO THROUGH A DISTINCT CHANGE IN STYLE 
THAT EXPLAINS THE KITCHEN DON'T GET ME WRONG THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT 
I JUST HAPPEN TO KNOW IT'S BEING COMPLETELY RIPPED OUT AND REMODELLED 
YOU KNOW THAT WHEN IT'S FINISHED IT'S GOING TO BE PHENOMENAL 
AND YOU'RE BOUND TO SEE A LOT MORE OF IT ON T. V. 
THERE'S NO REAL SENSE OF THE STYLE AND FLAMBOYANCE THAT I EXPECTED YET 
THIS IS A KIND OF MAKE DO AND MEND FOR THE MOMENT 
A PLEASANT ENOUGH T. V. ROOM 
INTERESTING STUFF ON THE WALLS 
CERTAINLY AN AUSTRALIAN INFLUENCE 
AND ONE OF MUHAMMAD ALI'S BOXING GLOVES 
THE COMPLETE COLLECTION OF THE GODFATHER 
I'VE BEEN RELIABLY INFORMED THAT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF AN OBSESSION 
WHAT'S THIS TITLE NEO REALISM IN ITALIAN COOKING 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
JUST LIKE THE GODFATHER THIS PERSON IS ALL ABOUT FAMILY 
THIS IS THE TEMPORARY GAMES ROOM FESTOONED WITH TOYS 
NICE TOY FERRARI IN THE CORNER 
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THIS PERSON HAD A REAL ONE 
BUT COME AND LOOK AT THIS 
I'M PRETTY UP WITH MY TOYS BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE 
IT'S KIND OF A HELL'S KITCHEN BOARD GAME LET'S SEE WHAT IT DOES 
YEAH 
IT'S TIME TO LOOK FOR THAT STYLE AND PANACHE I PROMISED 
AND IT BEGINS HERE ON THE LANDING FABULOUS FLOCK WALLPAPER A REAL RETRO FEEL 
NOW ALTHOUGH I DON'T USUALLY GO INTO BOYS' BEDROOMS YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS 
IT'S A BED NO IT'S A BOAT ISN'T IT GREAT 
COMPLETE WITH PORTHOLES AND 
NEMO 
WAIT YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS ONE TOO COME THROUGH TO THE ADJOINING EN SUITE 
ET VOILA IT'S A FERRARI BED 
BIT OF A THEME GOING ON WITH THIS HOUSEHOLD 
DO YOU THINK ANYONE WOULD MIND IF I LIE DOWN 
MORE FABULOUS FLOCK ON THE WAY TO THE MASTER BEDROOM 
AND YOU REALLY GET A FEEL OF THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL 
GOT TO HAVE THAT WOW FACTOR AND THIS HAS GOT IT 
A VERY WELL ORGANISED WALK IN WARDROBE 
FULL OF DESIGNER SHIRTS 
SUNGLASSES DESIGNER JEANS JUMPERS LOTS OF SUIT JACKETS 
AND LOOK EVEN WORK CLOTHES 
SO LET'S LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN 
THE NEO REALISM THE FERRARIS AND THE BOARD GAME 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LISA 
NOW FOR OUR HOME AND STUDIO AUDIENCE THOUGH NOT FOR OUR PANEL 
HERE IS WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
O. K. PAUL WE BEGIN WITH THOU 
GOSH THAT ONE IS REALLY REALLY TOUGH 
LOTS OF WORK IN PROGRESS SO NOT TOO MANY CLUES DOWNSTAIRS WHERE THE GENERAL LIVING GOES ON 
WE'VE JUST SEEN THE BEDROOMS AND THERE WERE NO CLUES THERE 
UM FAMILY MAN IT'S DEFINITELY A MAN 
LOVES HIS KIDS HAVEN'T THEY GOT CRACKING BEDROOMS 
LOTS OF THEMES ABOUT ITALY 
IS HE ITALIAN 
BUT I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE WHAT SORT OF FIELD HE WORKS IN AT THE MOMENT I REALLY DON'T 
DEBRA 
UM 
WELL I HAVE AN IDEA WHAT HE MIGHT DO 
BECAUSE THE FILM SHOWED THE GAME OF RATATOUILLE THE FILM OF RATATOUILLE 
SO EVEN THOUGH I THINK THERE'S THE GODFATHER AND THE RATATOUILLE OF FILMS 
I TEND TO THINK IT MIGHT BE MORE TO DO WITH THE KITCHEN 
BECAUSE ALSO LISA SAID THIS KITCHEN WOULD BE USED IN PROGRESS 
YEAH AND WOULD BE USED ON T. V. 
ON T. V. SO IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEBODY WHO IS A T. V. COOK 
T. V. CHEF T. V. CHEF 
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY FISHY ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING 
ISN'T THERE I THINK THERE MIGHT BE 
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BED IN THE SHAPE OF THE BOAT 
AND THE FISH ON THE WALL THE FISH 
WHOEVER THIS IS REALLY LIKES HIS FISH MM 
SO LET'S SEE NOW 
HE'S ITALIAN HE'S A MALE CHEF 
HE'S A FAMILY MAN HE LIKES COOKING FISH 
MM M. M. M. M. 
ANY MORE IDEAS 
OH DEAR I'VE GOT IT HAVE YOU 
I THINK I'VE GOT IT YEAH WE'VE GOT IT 
YES IT'S ALDO ZILLI 
YES ISN'T IT 
NOW I THOUGHT ALL THE WAY YOU WERE GOING THROUGH 
YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE ALDO ZILLI 
BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH IT ISN'T OOH 
H. M. M. BUT IT WAS A COMPLETELY FISHY THEME BECAUSE OF THE NEMO AND 
THAT WAS JUST A RED HERRING 
NO 
YOU GOT US STITCHED UP LIKE A KIPPER ON THIS ONE 
OTHER ITALIAN CHEFS WE NEED A CLUE 
REGULAR APPEARANCES ON B. B. C. READY STEADY COOK 
TONY REGULAR APPEARANCES ON THAT 
THAT'S THE SORT OF PICTURE OF THE MAN YES YES YEAH 
DAYTIME CHEF PRIMETIME CHEF HIS INTRIGUING BACKGROUND 
HE'S ALSO 
HE'S ESSENTIALLY ITALIAN AS YOU SAID 
SO IF YOU SWITCH ON A PROGRAMME AND YOU EXPECT TO SEE AN ITALIAN WHO KNOWS ABOUT FOOD 
AND IT'S NOT ALDO ZILLI WHO IS IT 
I THINK THIS ONE HAS GOT YOU I THINK WE'RE STUMPED STUMPED 
HOOK LINE AND SINKER 
PARDON YOU'VE GOT US HOOK LINE AND SINKER 
IT WASN'T WORTH IT THE FIRST TIME 
HE WAS BORN IN TORRE DEL GRECO IN NAPOLI AND HIS NAME IS 
GINO D'ACAMPO 
OH 
SO GINO D'ACAMPO WILL YOU COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
HOW ARE YOU PLEASED TO MEET YOU 
I WON'T KISS YOU I'LL SHAKE YOUR HAND MOST KIND 
COME AND TAKE A SEAT GINO 
WHY IS IT THAT ITALIAN FOOD IS SO POPULAR 
BECAUSE ITALIAN FOOD IS VERY MUCH LIKE ITALIAN MEN 
MINIMUM EFFORT MAXIMUM SATISFACTION 
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE 
THAT'S WHAT MY FATHER WANTS ME TO BELIEVE ANYWAY 
HOW DID YOU GET INTO THE FOOD BUSINESS I ER 
MY GRANDFATHER USED TO BE A CHEF YEAH 
I WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR WHEN I WAS A CHILD 
BECAUSE I THOUGHT WOMEN WILL DEFINITELY FANCY A MAN WITH A WHITE COAT 
I WENT TO STUDY FOR A YEAR TO BECOME A DOCTOR AND I THOUGHT NO WAY TOO DIFFICULT 
SO I WAS THINKING O. K. WHAT IS THE CLOSEST THING TO A WHITE JACKET AND BEING A DOCTOR 
THAT'S THE ONE I'M GOING TO BE A CHEF 
MY GRANDFATHER WAS ONE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING 
I LIKED THE FACT THAT HE COULD MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY JUST BY MAKING A PLATE OF PASTA 
IT'S AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE WHEN PEOPLE EAT YOUR FOOD AND LOVE IT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
TALKING ABOUT ALDO ZILLI THERE ARE YOU PASSIONATE ABOUT FISH 
AS VISITING YOUR HOME MAKES IT LOOK 
ARE YOU PARTICULARLY KEEN ON COOKING FISH EATING FISH AND ALL OF THAT OR NOT 
I LOVE FISH BUT NOT AS MUCH AS ALDO DOES 
I THINK I'M MORE OF A MEAT EATER MYSELF RIGHT 
ALSO BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS COUNTRY YOU CAN'T REALLY GET FRESH FISH ALL THE TIME 
WHICH IS VERY UPSETTING THERE SHOULD BE MORE FRESH FISH AROUND 
AND IS YOUR HOUSE A WORK IN PROGRESS AS LISA SAID 
YES IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS BECAUSE WE MOVED IN ABOUT A YEAR AGO YEAH 
AND MY WIFE CONVINCED ME 
THAT IT WOULD ONLY TAKE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS TO DO IT UP 
SO I SAID THAT'S A GOOD DEAL LET'S BUY THE HOUSE 
A COUPLE OF HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS AND WE'LL DO IT UP I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG 
BECAUSE IT ONLY TOOK ME TO THE FIRST FLOOR 
WE STILL HAVE TO DO ALL THE BOTTOM AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
BUT THEN IT WILL BE FINISHED 
IT LOOKS VERY GOOD VERY GOOD AT THE MOMENT 
IT LOOKS O. K. THE DOWNSTAIRS LOOKS O. K. 
WE JUST PAINTED WHATEVER WAS THERE 
WE DONE THE SECOND AND THE FIRST FLOOR NOW WE HAVE TO FINISH OFF DOWNSTAIRS 
WHY WAS BRITAIN PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO COME TO WORK HERE 
WAS IT PARTIALLY BECAUSE WE BRITS DO LOVE ITALIAN FOOD OR WAS IT THE NATURAL PLACE TO COME 
IT WAS THE WOMEN 
TO BE REALLY HONEST 
I REST MY CASE LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL 
I WAS SEVENTEEN 
I WAS SEVENTEEN AND I WENT TO WORK IN SPAIN TO OPEN A RESTAURANT 
THE WAITRESSES IN THE RESTAURANT WERE ALL ENGLISH 
SO WAS MY WIFE BECAUSE SHE WAS WORKING THERE AS WELL 
I ACTUALLY HAD NEVER SEEN A BLONDE GIRL WITH BEAUTIFUL EYES AND 
BECAUSE I'M USED TO DARK WOMEN HAIRY USUALLY 
SO THAT'S TRUE 
SO I WAS AMAZED TO SEE THIS BLONDE HAIR YOU KNOW 
AND I SAID THAT'S IT I WANT TO GO TO ENGLAND THAT'S THE PLACE TO GO 
A VERY VERY GOOD REASON AND TO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THIS EXPERIENCE 
YOU HAD ALSO WORKED IN SYLVESTER STALLONE'S MAMBO KING RESTAURANT 
YES IN MARBELLA WAS THAT 
YES IT WAS IN PUERTO BANUS I WAS ASKED TO GO FROM THE SCHOOL TO OPEN HIS RESTAURANT 
A GREAT EXPERIENCE A VERY VERY GREAT EXPERIENCE 
I MET THE GUY A COUPLE OF TIMES 
HE'S NOT AS BIG AS PEOPLE THINK NO HE ISN'T 
THAT'S TRUE HE'S QUITE A SHORT GUY A BIT LIKE ALAN LADD 
INDEED YOUR ENGLISH IS SO GOOD THAT YOU'RE WRITING YOUR OWN BOOKS NOW 
YES I JUST FINISHED MY FIRST BOOK WHICH WAS OUT LAST OCTOBER 
AND I'M WRITING THE SECOND ONE AT THE MOMENT YES 
SO IF ENGLAND WERE PLAYING ITALY AT SOCCER WHO WOULD YOU CHEER FOR 
I KNEW YOU WOULD ASK ME THAT 
O. K. DEPEND IF I'M IN THE PUB DEFINITELY THE ENGLISH 
OTHERWISE I'M GONNA GET KILLED AT SOME POINT 
IF I'M AT HOME ON MY OWN I WILL GO FOR THE ITALIANS 
THAT'S A GOOD COMPROMISE THAT'S GOOD ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL 
YOU HAVE CAPELLO NOW SO YOU SHOULD BE QUITE O. K. 
YES WE'RE ALL ITALIANS NOW THAT'S RIGHT 
WHAT A JOY TO HAVE YOU WITH US GINO AND THIS IS OUR KEY 
THE THROUGH THE KEYHOLE KEY WHICH SAYS THANKS A MILLION FOR BEING WITH US 
THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH GINO A MILLION THANKS THANK YOU 
THANK YOU 
OUR THANKS TO GINO THERE 
AND NOW LET'S JOIN LISA 
WE JOIN HER AT HOUSE NUMBER TWO 
REMEMBER THE CLUES ARE THERE AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
THERE'S SOMETHING RATHER SPECIAL ABOUT CENTRAL LONDON APARTMENTS 
OUTSIDE JUST A FEW FEET AWAY IS CHELSEA AND THAT'S AN AMAZING PLACE 
PEOPLE DRESS UP TO GO SHOPPING 
AFTER ALL YOU HAVE TO BE SEEN IN THE RIGHT CLOTHES 
IT WAS AS IF THEY WERE APPEARING ON A FILM SET OR ON LOCATION FOR TELEVISION 
BUT IN HERE AWAY FROM THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE 
ALL IS CALM QUIET AND EXTREMELY ELEGANT 
THERE'S SOMETHING QUITE THEATRICAL ABOUT THIS LITTLE TABLEAU HERE 
THIS RATHER BEAUTIFUL BRONZE LADY HOLDING ALOFT THIS TORCH 
LIGHTING UP THIS FABULOUS PAINTING 
I LOVE THE WINE THE HALF EATEN APPLE THE CHEESE 
BUT I AM QUITE SURPRISED THERE'S NOT A COFFEE CUP IN THERE SOMEWHERE 
WHAT A GRAND ENTRANCE TO THIS WELL HOW DO I DESCRIBE IT A SALON 
NO NOT THE HAIR SALON THAT WOULDN'T CUT IT 
BUT THIS IS SOMEWHERE YOU COULD HOLD A SOIREE 
I COULD IMAGINE LOVELY LADIES SITTING CHATTING AND PERHAPS WAITING FOR A GENTLEMAN CALLER 
AND I THINK THAT'S ABOUT AS FAR AS MY IMAGINATION HAD BETTER GO MM 
VERY ELEGANT ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL THINGS EVERYWHERE 
THERE'S ART THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY STRONG INTEREST IN ART 
AND THERE'S A WONDERFUL SET OF SHAKESPEARE'S WORKS 
THERE'S A SCRIPT BEING READ 
AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IT'S GOT CONFIDENTIAL STAMPED ALL OVER IT 
IT SEEMS VERY GOOD THOUGH 
A PICTURE MIGHT PAINT A THOUSAND WORDS 
BUT IT'S GOOD TO HAVE SOME SOOTHING MUSIC WHILE YOU WORK YOUR WAY INTO THE NIGHT 
SOMETHING LIKE AZNAVOUR OR SOME ITALIAN MUSIC 
WHILE YOU SIP YOUR COFFEE IN AN ATTEMPT TO STAY AWAKE AND INSPIRED 
THERE'S MORE THAN A PASSING INTEREST IN ART 
THIS PERSON IS AN ARTIST AND A VERY GOOD ONE 
I WISH I COULD PAINT AND DRAW 
HANDY IF YOU'VE EVER HAD TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HOSPITALS 
YOU'D KNOW WHERE THE APPENDIX WAS IF YOU HAD TO HELP IN CASUALTY 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN 
THE SCRIPT THE SALON AND THE ART 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LISA 
NOW FOR OUR HOME AND STUDIO AUDIENCE HERE'S WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
WILLIAM 
A DELIGHTFUL RESIDENCE ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL 
CLEARLY A VERY TALENTED PERSON LIVING THERE I REALLY LOVED THE ART ON THE WALL 
AND THE PICTURES AND THEN YOU SEE THE ART THAT THIS PERSON PRODUCES 
OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE WHO LIKES TO STAY AWAKE A LOT THIS BUSINESS ABOUT COFFEE 
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS 
DEBRA 
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS PERSON MIGHT BE A WRITER 
BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY WHO'S INTO LITERATURE AND ART 
AND WITH A SCRIPT THERE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A WRITER OR AN ACTRESS 
AND I'M THINKING THAT THE COFFEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A COFFEE ADVERT 
OH 
OH BUT OF COURSE THERE WAS A BIG HINT ABOUT CASUALTY 
BUT I DON'T THINK SHE'S IN CASUALTY 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE TOO OBVIOUS 
YES I THINK IT'S JUST THE ANATOMY I THINK IT'S ANOTHER MEDICAL PROGRAMME THAT SHE MIGHT BE IN 
WHO'S DONE THE COFFEE AD RECENTLY 
IT'S THAT ISN'T IT 
YEAH IT'S THAT 
SHE'S ALSO ER 
I'M TRYING TO THINK 
A GREAT ACTRESS YES AND 
I'M TRYING TO PHRASE THIS DIPLOMATICALLY 
UM OF THE MORE MATURE GENERATION SO THERE WAS NO JUKEBOX OR 
A WOMAN WITH GREAT TASTE REALLY REFINED AND ELEGANT 
EXCEPTIONAL ELEGANCE AND BEAUTY SHE IS BEAUTIFUL AS WELL 
I'M WONDERING I KNOW IT WE'RE VERY HUNG UP ON THIS COFFEE BUSINESS 
YES IT'S A QUESTION OF HOW RECENT THE COFFEE COMMERCIAL WAS MM 
WOULD IT HAVE BEEN THE ONE WITH THE VERY FAMOUS SERIES FROM SOME YEARS AGO 
LIKE A SOAP OPERA NO YES IT WAS 
OOH WAS IT WHO DO YOU THINK IT WAS WAS IT CHERIE LUNGHI 
YES CHERIE LUNGHI IT IS INDEED 
CHERIE LUNGHI WILL YOU COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE

BUT I'M NOT KNOCKING IT NO ABSOLUTELY 
IT WAS GOLD BLEND WASN'T IT NO IT WASN'T CAN WE BRAND NAME HERE YES 
DEBRA SAID IT WAS GOLD BLEND 
I THOUGHT IT WAS PEOPLE ALWAYS CONFUSE IT IT WAS KENCO KENCO 
YES IT DOES GET CONFUSED WITH THE RICHNESS YES 
HOW MANY YEARS DID YOU DO IT FOR 
TEN YEARS TEN YEARS FANTASTIC IT WAS FANTASTIC YES 
IT WAS GREAT ESPECIALLY FOR AN ACTOR TO HAVE A LOVELY PILLOW OF WORK AN INCOME LIKE THAT 
MY DAUGHTER WAS GROWING UP THEN 
SO IT MEANT I DIDN'T HAVE TO RUN ROUND THE COUNTRY PURSUING WORK 
I COULD BE A LITTLE MORE CHOOSY AND BE HOME AND BE A MOTHER THAT WAS A LUXURY YOU KNOW 
YOUR DAUGHTER IS GOING INTO IT TOO SHE IS ALREADY SHE'S BEEN IN THE PALACE 
SHE'S WORKING AWAY FOLLOWING IN MY FOOTSTEPS 
THE PALACE THEATRE NOT THE PALACE THEATRE 
NOT BUCKINGHAM PALACE NO 
YES SHE'S GOT A JOB AS A PALACE MAID 
NO OF COURSE I TAKE IT FOR GRANTED 
SHE'S IN THE PALACE THE T. V. SERIES ABOUT A HYPOTHETICAL ROYAL FAMILY OH YES 
SHE PLAYS THE REBELLIOUS DAUGHTER PRINCESS 
PEOPLE SOMETIMES SAY THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE I BET YOU'RE DELIGHTED SHE'S 
I AM ACTUALLY FOR A LONG TIME I HAD NERVES ABOUT IT AS MOST ACTORS DO 
IT'S SUCH A DIFFICULT PROFESSION ALL THE REJECTION 
BUT I SEE HOW MUCH SHE LOVES IT AND SHE'S STARTING TO HAVE SOME SUCCESSES 
SHE'S GETTING WORK AND SHE'S PASSIONATE 
NO ONE COULD HAVE STOPPED ME FROM DOING IT 
AND I'VE HAD A WONDERFUL LIFE DOING WHAT I DO A REALLY FASCINATING LIFE 
DID YOU NEARLY DO ANYTHING ELSE I NEARLY PAINTED IT WAS A BIT OF A TOSS UP BETWEEN THE TWO EARLY ON 
BUT THEN I ALWAYS LOVED PERFORMING BECAUSE I LOVED BALLET AS WELL 
BUT PAINTING IS BECOMING MORE IMPORTANT AGAIN 
IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN BUT NOW I HAVE TIME TO PURSUE IT 
I CAN DO LITTLE COURSES AND ATTEND DRAWING CLASSES AND I KEEP MY HAND IN MORE 
IN TERMS OF DYNASTIES YES 
YOU LIVED IN THAT HOUSE WITH YOUR MOTHER YES I DID NOW YOUR DAUGHTER LIVES WITH YOU THERE TOO 
EXACTLY WE MOVED IN THERE YEARS AGO AND WE RENTED IT 
AND THEN I WAS IN A POSITION TO BUY IT ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO 
MY MOTHER CONTINUED TO LIVE IN IT WITH MY AUNT 
THEY'RE DECEASED GOD REST THEIR SOULS THEN I DID A LITTLE JOB ON IT 
IT ONLY HAD ONE RADIATOR SO I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO UPDATE IT 
DID YOU CHANGE IT AS THEY SAY STRUCTURALLY A LITTLE BIT 
I KNOCKED A COUPLE OF WALLS DOWN TO MAKE A BIGGER KITCHEN 
WE USED TO GO TO THE LAUNDERETTE BUT YOU CAN'T ANYMORE 
IT'S CLOSED SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE ALL THE APPLIANCES SO YOU NEED A BIGGER KITCHEN 
I DIDN'T WANT TO DESTROY THE FABRIC OF IT OR MAKE IT UNRECOGNISABLE AS THE FLAT THAT I GREW UP IN 
BECAUSE IT'S GOT SOME WONDERFUL IT'S GOT A LOVELY ATMOSPHERE AND GREAT MEMORIES FOR ME 
WE SAW THE ATMOSPHERE IF YOU CAN SEE ATMOSPHERE 
WHAT ARE THE REAL LANDMARKS OF YOUR LIFE AND CAREER CHERIE 
EXCALIBUR YES THAT WAS THAT WAS THE FIRST BIG MOVIE 
YES THAT WAS MY FIRST MOVIE WITH JOHN BOORMAN 
I WENT TO IRELAND AND FILMED WITH LIAM NEESON AND GABRIEL BYRNE AND HELEN MIRREN 
WHO I'D WORKED WITH PREVIOUSLY AT THE ROYAL COURT 
SO THAT WAS A HUGE STEP UP IN TERMS OF MY CAREER CERTAINLY 
BUT EARLIER EVEN THAN THAT MY BIG AMBITION COMING OUT OF DRAMA SCHOOL AND WORKING IN REP 
WAS TO JOIN THE ROYAL SHAKESPEARE COMPANY 
BECAUSE THAT WAS LIKE MY UNIVERSITY REALLY CUTTING MY TEETH AS AN ACTOR 
WHEN YOU WENT THERE WAS TREVOR NUNN THERE 
I WORKED WITH TREVOR NUNN JOHN BARTON A SHAKESPEARE SCHOLAR 
I LEARNT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT ABOUT SHAKESPEARE FROM HIM 
I WORKED WITH JUDI DENCH IAN MCKELLEN 
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAND IN THE WINGS AND LEARN MY CRAFT 
WATCHING THESE PEOPLE AND REHEARSING WITH THEM 
WHAT HAVE BEEN THE LANDMARKS IN TELEVISION 
THE MANAGERESS I THINK I WORKED STEADILY IN ALL SORTS OF INTERESTING DRAMAS 
BUT I THINK THE MANAGERESS WAS THE ONE THAT REALLY PUT ME ON THE MAP YEAH ON THE MAP YES 
AND WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO IN THE FUTURE 
I NEVER THINK ABOUT THAT NOT ANYMORE 
I USED TO RUN AFTER DIFFERENT GOALS I'VE DONE THAT NOW I WANT THIS 
I HAD A HANKERING AMBITION FOR THINGS 
IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I'M ACTUALLY QUITE HAPPY WITH THINGS AS THEY ARE 
AS LONG AS I'VE GOT TIME TO PAINT AS WELL 
I CAN BALANCE THE TWO LOVES OF MY LIFE 
AND WAS THE TRIP WAS IT THREE OR FOUR YEARS THAT YOU NIPPED OFF TO HOLLYWOOD 
FOUR YEARS WAS THAT A GOOD IDEA 
YES IT WAS IT WAS 
I DID A SERIES OUT THERE AND MY DAUGHTER'S FATHER LIVES THERE 
SO IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HER TO SEE MORE OF HIM 
I'D SORT OF ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT AND FLIRTED WITH IT AND NOT REALLY COMMITTED TO IT PREVIOUSLY 
BECAUSE OF INTERESTING WORK HERE I'M GLAD I GOT IT OUT OF MY SYSTEM 
IT WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE TOO 
COMING UP I READ HERE WE'LL BE SEEING YOU APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH
