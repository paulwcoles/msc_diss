MORNING CEILING 
GORDON BROWN IS 
IN WASHINGTON TODAY TO HOLD TALKS 
WITH GEORGE BUSH OVER THE DEEPENING 
GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS HE IS 
EXPECTING TO MEET BETWEEN MAIN 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HILARY 
CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA WERE 
FACING EACH OTHER IN A TELEVISION 
DEBATE LAST NIGHT OUR 
CORRESPONDENT WAS IN PHILADELPHIA 
TO WATCH THAT NOT LONG FOR 
PRESIDENT BUSH IS IT IMPORTANT 
THAT PEOPLE'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH 
THESE CANDIDATES 
HEAT BUILDS L. 
THINK IT IS UNFORTUNATELY FOR 
GORDON BROWN HIS ARRIVAL HAS BEEN 
ECLIPSED BY THE REVIVAL OF THE POPE 
THERE IS LITTLE ATTENTION IN THE 
AMERICAN MEDIA HAVING SAID THAT 
HE HAS IMPORTED DISCUSSIONS WITH 
PRESIDENT BUSH ON THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
THE BALL IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 
THE FOCUS WILL BE VERY MUCH ON THE 
THREE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WHO 
HE WILL BE MEETING BARACK OBAMA 
FOR THE FIRST TIME AS PRESIDENT THAT 
CONTROVERSIAL PREACHER WHO HAS 
MADE SOME INFLAMMATORY OF REMARKS 
TIE IS IT LOOKED AWKWARD FOR HIM 
THERE WERE AWKWARD MOMENTS AS WELL 
FOR HILARY CLINTON WHEN SHE WAS 
ASKED ABOUT THE INCIDENT IN BOSNIA 
NINETEEN NINETY SIX WHEN SHE VISITED SHE SAID SHE 
WAS UNDER SNIPER FIRE VIDEO 
EVIDENCE DOES NOT PROVE THAT TO BE 
TRUE 
I MAY BE A LOT OF THINGS BUT TRUE I AM NOT DAMN L. WROTE ABOUT GOING 
TO BOSNIA IN MY PICK IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
BOOK WON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS IN 
THE LAST WEEKS I'D JUST SAID 
SOMETHING SAT WHEN NOT IN KEEPING 
WITH WHAT I NEED TO BE THE CASE 
SOME THINGS THAT WERE NOT L. AM 
EMBARRASSED AND HAVE APOLOGISED 
THERE HAVE BEEN TWENTY ONE DEBATES SO FAR 
NONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN DECISIVE AND 
CONCLUSIVE THE VOTERS OF 
PENNSYLVANIA THEY WILL TAKE PART 
IN THE PRIME ME NEXT WEEK THAT MAY 
NOT DECIDE THE OUTCOME PRIMARY 
THE POPE SAYS THE BREAKDOWN OF 
AMERICAN SOCIETY IS PARTLY TO BLAME 
FOR THE SCANDALS THAT BLIGHTED THE 
ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH HE BERATED 
BISHOPS FOR THE HANDLING OF 
PAEDOPHILE PRIESTS THE HEAD OF THE 
U. K.'S BIGGEST EXAM BOARD IS WARNING 
THAT URGENT ACTION IS NEEDED TO 
PREVENT THE FAILURE OF OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S NEW FLAGSHIP DIPLOMA 
SYSTEM EDEXEL SAYS THAT TEACHERS 
WILL NOT BE ADEQUATELY TRAINED BY 
THE TIME THE SCHEME LAUNCHES IN 
SEPTEMBER THE DIPLOMAS COULD 
EVENTUALLY REPLACE A LEVELS AND 
GCSES THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS 
UTTER NONSENSE TO SUGGEST THE PANTS 
ARE IN DISARRAY TWO NEW STUDIES 
SUGGEST DRINKING SMOKING AND BAD 
DIET COULD SPEED UP THE ONSET OF 
ALZHEIMER'S PEOPLE WITH HIGH 
CHOLESTEROL LEVELS IN HER EARLY 
FORTIES ARE ALSO MORE SUSCEPTIBLE 
TO THE DISEASE IN THEIR EARLY 
FORTIES THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS 
CLOSE TO AGREEING A PLAN DESIGNED 
TO PREVENT THE LOG JAM IN ENDING 
IT IS HOPED THE UNPRECEDENTED 
ACTION WILL STABILISE THE TROUBLE 
IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THE FIRST 
THING MANY PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT THE 
GLOBAL CREDIT CRISIS WAS LONG 
QUEUES OUTSIDE BRANCHES OF NORTHERN 
ROCK PEOPLE IN THE U. S. HAD BEEN 
GIVEN MORTGAGES THEY COULD NOT 
AFFORD WHICH MEANT BANKS WERE 
WORRIED ABOUT LENDING TO EACH OTHER 
AND THE GLOBAL CREDIT MARKETS DRIED 
UP THAT BLOCKAGE IN THE CREDIT 
PIPE MEANS BANKS CANNOT GET ENOUGH 
CASH FROM THE WHOLESALE MARKETS TO 
LEND TO US THAT IS WHY MORTGAGE 
RATES HAVE BEEN GOING UP THE 
GOVERNMENT IS GETTING ITS PLUNGER 
OUT IT IS GOING TO SWAP THE 
POSSIBLY BAD MORTGAGE ASSETS THE 
BANKS HAVE FOR BOMBS BANKS WILL BE 
ABLE TO USE THESE TO GET OTHER 
BANKS TO LEND TO THEM WE SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO GET CHEAPER MORTGAGES WHAT WHAT I HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT WORRIES ME 
CLEARLY IT IS A DESPERATE NEED FOR 
LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT TO GET THE 
BANKING SYSTEM WORKING AGAIN THERE 
IS A REAL DANGER THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS SIMPLY BEARING OUT 
THE BANKS 
THE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING 
ON MORTGAGE ASSETS WHICH MAY TURN 
OUT TO BE VERY BAD INVESTMENTS TO 
PROTECT TAXPAYERS IT IS LIKELY TO 
PAY LESS FOR THESE ASSETS THAN THEY 
ARE WORTH HOW MUCH LESS IS TRICKY 
TOO LITTLE AND BANKS WILL NOT BE 
INTERESTED IN THE DEAL AND TO MATCH 
TAXPAYERS COULD END UP FOOTING THE 
BILL THE OLYMPIC TORCH HAS ARRIVED 
IN DELHI AMID TIGHT SECURITY IT IS 
THERE ON THE LATEST LEG OF ITS 
CONTROVERSIAL TOUR AHEAD OF THE 
BEIJING GAMES THE POLICE HAVE 
ARRESTED TWO BETTER EXCISE HE TRIED 
TO STALK STORM THE EMBASSY PETER 
ROBINSON WILL BE CONFIRMED TODAY AS 
THE NEW LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
UNIONIST PARTY THE EAST BELFAST M. P. 
WILL REPLACE THE REVEREND IAN 
PAISLEY WHO STEPS DOWN NEXT MONTH 
IT COULD BE JUNE BEFORE MR. ROBINSON 
BECOMES THE FIRST MINISTER N. H. S. 
MANAGERS HAVE SUPPORTED PLANS TO 
CREATE G. P. SUPER SURGERIES DOCTORS 
HAVE CRITICISED WHAT THEY ARE 
DESCRIBING AS THE HEADLONG RUSH TO 
CREATE THE SO CALLED POLYCLINICS 
THE SURGERIES WILL HOUSE FAMILY 
DOCTORS ALONGSIDE OTHER SERVICES 
SUCH AS DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND 
DENTISTRY THIS IS HOW THE 
GOVERNMENT SEES THE FUTURE OF 
HEALTH CARE IN ENGLAND A HEALTH 
CENTRE WITH A BIG GROUP OF G. P.'S IN A 
SERIES OF OTHER SERVICES LIKE 
BRETTON A SCREENING FOR DIABETES 
PATIENTS MINISTERS WANT 
POLYCLINICS TO GIVE PATIENTS MORE 
CARE IN ONE PLACE IT IS A HIGHLY 
CONTROVERSIAL POLICY CRITICS SAY 
ONE CONSEQUENCE WOULD BE AN END TO 
SMALL SURGES LIKE THIS ONE WHERE 
PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO SEE THE SAME 
G. P. SURGERIES N. H. S. MANAGERS HAVE 
SAID POLYCLINICS COULD HELP IMPROVE 
HEALTH CARE THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT 
ABOUT SAVING MONEY BUT ABOUT GIVING 
PATIENTS A BETTER EXPERIENCE OF 
THEY SAY THEY WOULD HELP STOP 
PEOPLE BEING BOUNCED AROUND THE 
SYSTEM FROM G. P. TO HOSPITAL AND BACK 
PATIENTS COULD STILL BE SEEN BY THE 
SAME DOCTOR THAT HAS NOT REASSURE 
THE SCEPTICS 
WE BELIEVE IT IS MUCH 
BETTER TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF 
GENERAL PRACTICE TO ALLOW THEM TO 
EXPAND THE SERVICES AND IMPROVE 
THEIR SERVICES FOR PATIENTS THAT 
IS WHAT PATIENTS WANT TO SEE NOT 
AN IMPERSONAL PRIVATELY RUN CLINIC 
POLYCLINICS ARE CENTRAL TO 
GOVERNMENT HEALTH POLICY SO 
DESPITE THE OPPOSITION WE ARE 
LIKELY TO BE SEEING MANY MORE 
PLACES LIKE THIS ONE IN THE FUTURE 
HE MIGHT GET BORED OF HEARING HOW 
VOICES DRONING ON EVERY MORNING 
YOU MIGHT WE HAVE GOT A NEW ONE 
WHICH HAS NOT BEEN HAD FOR THIRTY THOUSAND 
YEARS RESEARCHERS IN AMERICA HAVE 
RECREATED THE VOICE OF NEANDERTHAL 
MAN BY RECONSTRUCTING HIS VOCAL 
TRACTS BASED ON THE SHAPE OF 
FOSSIL SKULLS HE IS WHAT IT SOUNDS 
LIKE HE IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE 
A TELETUBBY SO FAR THE SCIENTISTS 
HAVE ONLY ENGINEERED THE SOUND OF A 
NEANDERTHAL SAYING E. IT SHOWS HOW 
DIFFERENT HE SPEAKS TO MODERN 
HUMANS THEY PLAN EVENTUALLY TO 
SIMULATE AN ENTIRE NEANDERTHALS 
SENTENCE NEANDERTHALS CHRIS 
COULD PROBABLY TELL US NOW TALKING 
ABOUT KATE VAN WYK BEHAVIOUR THERE 
WAS A TUSSLE AT THE END OF THE 
CELTIC RANGERS' MATCH LAST NIGHT

EUROPE EIGHT HOUR WORKING DAY YOU

THEM ARE PRODUCTIVE THERE HAS ALSO 
A PLAN TO EASE THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
IT COULD BRING DOWN THE COST OF 
MORTGAGES AND MAKE OVERDRAFT 
CHEAPER BANKS COULD BE ALLOWED TO 
SWAP MORTGAGES AND OTHER ASSETS ON 
THEIR BOOKS FOR SAFER GOVERNMENT 
BONDS THE BANKS USE THESE ASSETS 
AS GUARANTEES WHEN THEY BORROW FROM 
OTHER BANKS BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN 
AS VALUED OR TRUSTED SINCE THE 
AMERICAN MORTGAGE CRISIS LAST 
SUMMER THIS COULD MAKE BANKS MORE 
WILLING TO LEND TO EACH OTHER 
BRINGING DOWN THE OH FOUR COST OF 
LENDING LENDING THE COST OF MORTGAGES HAS RISEN 
THREE TIMES FASTER THAN PAY PACKETS

MURDER OF RHYS JONES

DO I WILL TELL HER 
WHY MEDIUMS AND CLAIRVOYANCE HAVE 
LOOKED INTO THEIR FUTURE AND WHY 
THEY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT THEY 
SEE SEE SHE CAN LOOK INTO THE FUTURE 
A LITTLE BIT 
IT IS DIFFERENT THE FEEL OF THINGS 
OUT HERE THIS MORNING DESPITE 
CLEAR SKIES AND SUNSHINE IN THE 
LONDON AREA AN EASTERLY WIND HAS 
PICKED UP AND IT IS COLD WE ARE 
STARTING WITH SEVERE WEATHER 
WARNING AND IT IS FORCED KNOW WE 
HAVE SNOW SHOWERS THROUGH SOUTH 
DERBYSHIRE NORTH DERBYSHIRE 
SURREY AND SOUTH YORKSHIRE IF YOU 
ARE TRAVELLING OVER THE TRANS 
PENNINE ROUTES IT COULD CAUSE 
PROBLEMS THIS MORNING FOR THE NEXT 
FEW HOURS IT COULD BE NASTY SOME 
OF THE SHOWERS WILL STILL BE 
LINGERING ON THE HIGHER GROUND 
THERE WILL BE SLEET AND SNOW MIXED 
IN IT IS COLD START AND THERE 
COULD BE PROBLEMS ON THE ROADS 
EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST 
CORNER IT IS A CHILLY START BUT WE 
HAVE BRIGHT SPELLS BY NINE AM SUNNY 
SPELLS ACROSS THE SOUTH COAST AND 
ALSO IN SOUTH WESTERN SOUTH WALES 
WHERE IT WILL BE PLEASANT BUT 
THERE WILL BE STIFF EASTERLY WIND 
MAKING IT FEEL FRESHER THAN THE 
TEMPERATURE SUGGEST THERE COULD BE 
SLEET AND SNOW IN NORTH WALES 
NORTHERN IRELAND A TOUCH OF FROST 
AS THE DAY PROGRESSES THE SHOWERS 
ACROSS THE MIDLANDS AND SOUTH 
YORKSHIRE WOULD DRIFT FURTHER WEST 
THE EASTERLY WINDS BRING IN MORE 
RAIN TO COME AND MAYBE A WINTRY MIX 
TO HIGHER GROUND TO THE NORTH EAST 
OF ENGLAND AND THAT WILL DRIFT WEST 
TO OUT THE DAY TOWARDS NEITHER 
NORTHERN IRELAND OVERNIGHT IT IS A 
MESSY SCENARIO THE THREAT OF RAIN 
DRIFTING UP FROM THE SOUTH 
TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE NIGHT 
GENERALLY ABOVE FREEZING RAIN IS 
STARTING TO DRIFT UP FROM THE SOUTH 
TOMORROW IT WILL BE CLOUDY AND WET 
PATCHY RAIN CLEARING AWAY FROM THE 
NORTH OF ENGLAND 
IF YOU WERE TRYING TO BE FUNNY YOU 
COULD SAY THEY SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT 
COMING BUT SPIRITUALISTS AND 
CLAIRVOYANCE ARE SAYING YOU 
CONSUMER LAWS ON NO LAUGHING MATTER 
THEY CLAIM THEY CAN BE SUED BY 
PEOPLE WHO CLAIMED THEY WERE TOLD 
SOMETHING THAT TURNED OUT TO BE 
WRONG THEY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS 
AREN'T THEY 
THEY ARE THEY ARE WORRIED BECAUSE 
IF IN THE PAST YOU FELT HE WENT TO 
A PSYCHIC OR MEDIUM AND YOU HAD 
BEEN CONNED AND YOU WANT TO TAKE 
THEM TO COURT YOU HAD TO PROVE IN 
COURT 
INTENDED TO DECEIVE 
COURT THEY HAD INTENDED TO DECEIVE YOU PROVING WHAT SOMEBODY INTENDED 
TO DO IS DIFFICULT AND HARDLY ANY 
MEDIUMS AND PSYCHICS HAVE BEEN DONE 
IN COURT THE CONSUMER PROTECTION 
REGULATIONS OR YOU HAVE TO DO IS 
SHOW YOU WERE MISLED IT IS EASY TO 
SHOW YOU HAVE BEEN MISLED BY A 
MEDIUM OR PSYCHIC NOW THEY ARE 
STARTING TO PANIC 
WE ARE HERE TO BRING THROUGH LOVED 
ONES WHERE I LIKE TO CALL HEAVEN 
A MEETING OF THE SPIRITUALIST 
CHURCH IN WIMBLEDON 
I HAVE A 
GENTLEMAN WHO PASSED WITH A HEART 
CONDITION A FATHER FIGURE DOES 
THAT MAKE SENSE THIS THIS CLAIRVOYANTS CLAIMS TO BE GETTING 
MESSAGES FROM THIS WOMAN'S DEAD 
FATHER 
HAVE YOU BEEN DISCUSSING FATHER MOVING HOME YES 
HE IS NOT TELLING YES YOU WHAT TO DO 
FOR SPIRITUALISTS 
ARE NERVOUS BECAUSE THEY TAKE 
DONATIONS THEY ARE CLASSED AS 
TRADERS WHICH COME UNDER A NEW 
CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW THEY SAY 
IT COULD LEAVE THEM OPEN TO LEGAL 
ACTION FROM DISGRUNTLED CUSTOMERS 
OUR MAIN CONCERN IS ANYTHING WE 
SAY COULD BE MISCONSTRUED AND END 
UP WITH SOMEONE FEELING UNSATISFIED 
OR UNHAPPY AND AT THE END OF THE 
DAY TAKE LEGAL ACTION WE ARE A 
RELIGION A WAY OF LIFE 
THE NEW 
LAW IS DUE TO COME INTO EFFECT NEXT 
MONTH AND IT WILL BEEF UP 
PROTECTION TO CONSUMERS IT WILL 
MEAN ANY TRADERS INCLUDING 
PSYCHICS OF CLAIRVOYANCE CAN BE 
PROSECUTED IF THEY MISLEAD THE 
AVERAGE CONSUMER GROUPS LIKE BAD 
PSYCHICS SAY THEY ARE ALL 
MISLEADING BECAUSE ANYTHING THEY 
SAY IS NOT PROVABLE SHOULD THEY 
START TO PANIC TRADING STANDARDS 
SAY PROBABLY NOT AS LONG AS THE 
CLAIMS THEY MAKE ARE HONEST 
HE TOO 
IS THE GENUINELY ROGUE TRADERS AND 
THE SCAM ARTISTS THEY ARE THE 
PEOPLE WHO SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR 
UNDER THESE NEW RULES AND 
SPIRITUALIST CHURCHES AND OTHERS 
REALLY THIS ISN'T DESIGNED TO 
ATTACK THEM OF GO AFTER THEM IN ANY 
WAY WHATSOEVER 
PEOPLE WE HAVE 
SPOKEN TO WHO VISIT PSYCHICS SAY 
MORE PROTECTION IS NEEDED THIS 
LADY HAD A NUMBER OF READINGS AFTER 
HER HUSBAND DIED FROM CANCER 
TRAGICALLY YOUNG 
I THINK I WAS 
GOING HOPING SOMEBODY WOULD TELL ME 
EVERYTHING WOULD BE O. K. BUT I KNEW 
THEY COULDN'T TELL ME THAT THEY 
WERE GIVING ME SOME OPTIMISM FOR 
THE FUTURE 
DID YOU FEEL EXPLOITED 
NO I CAME OUT FEELING QUITE 
OPTIMISTIC I WENT IN KNOWING THAT 
WHAT THEY MIGHT SAY MIGHT BE TRUE 
AND MIGHT NOT BE TRUE NEVERTHELESS NEVERTHELESS THE CLAIMS AND ADVERTS MADE BY 
PSYCHICS AND MEDIUMS WILL BE 
SCRUTINISED CLOSELY FOR MISLEADING 
STATEMENTS MANY ARE ALREADY 
PUTTING DISCLAIMERS IN THE SMALL 
PRINT SAYING WHAT THEY OFFER IS 
MAINLY ENTERTAINMENT 
IF WE TALK ABOUT THAT DISCLAIMER 
IT IS A DIFFICULTY FOR SPIRITUALIST 
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT SAY IT AS 
ENTERTAINMENT THIS IS ALMOST 
RELIGION FOR THEM 
THAT IS WHY THEY 
ARE GOING TO DOWNING STREET TO HAND 
IN A PETITION IT IS NOT JUST A BIT 
OF FUN IT IS NOT GYPSY ROSE LEE AT 
THE END OF THE PEER IT IS A 
RELIGION A WAY OF LIFE L. THINK 
THEY ARE COUPLE OF THE SAVING 
GRACES A LOT OF PEOPLE GO TO THESE 
CHURCHES BELIEVING AND THEY WON'T 
COMPLAIN THAT LADY IN THE FILM 
THEY MAY KNOW AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS 
IT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE BUT THEY GO 
WITH THEIR EYES OPEN SO WHO IS 
GOING TO COMPLAIN THE OFFICE OF 
FAIR TRADING TELL ME THEY ARE 
AFTER THE BIG TIME SCANNERS WHO 
SENT LETTERS LIKE THIS FROM SOMEONE 
WHO IS CLAIMING TO BE DECLARED VOID 
INCE WHO SAY ACT QUICKLY BECAUSE 
THERE IS A THREAT HANGING OVER YOU 
THEN THEY DEMANDED MONEY IT IS 
THIS KIND OF THING THE OFFICE OF 
FAIR TRADING HARTWRIGHT TO STAND 
OUT OUT SOMEBODY ELSE GETS THE BALL IT 
LATER IN THE PROGRAMME

CHARGE MARTIN JOHNSON IS THE NEW

NATIONAL SIDE JOHNSON WILL OF 
COURSE REPLACE THIS MAN BRIAN 
ASHTON HE HAS RECEIVED PLENTY 
PLENTY OF CRITICISM AT THE START OF 
THE WORLD CUP AND THE SIX NATIONS 
CHAMPIONSHIPS HE HAS BEEN OFFERED 
TO A ROLE IN THE ACADEMY 
WE HAD AN 
UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR 
THE GUY HE KNEW HOW TO WIN RUGBY 
GAMES HE WAS NOT AN EXTREME 
COMMUNICATOR ON THE FIELD OFF THE 
FIELD HE MADE THINGS HAPPEN 
BETWEEN THE MANAGEMENT AND THE 
PLAYERS ON THE FIELD HE WAS 
LEADING FROM THE FRONT HE WAS 
SETTING DEPART EXTREMELY HIGH AND 
SETTING EXAMPLES FOR THE REST OF US 
TO FOLLOW THE PATH 
THEY ENGLAND 
RUGBY TEAM ALSO NEED A NEW CAPTAIN 
PHIL VICKERY HAS BEEN RULED OUT FOR 
THE REST OF THE SEASON VICKERY HAS 
SUFFERED A TEAR TO THE MEDIAL 
COLLATERAL LIGAMENT IN HIS RIGHT 
KNEE HE IS RULED OUT OF THE 
ENGLISH TOUR TO NEW ZEALAND IN JUNE 
GREAT BRITAIN HAVE BEEN DRAWN 
AGAINST AUSTRIA IN THE DAVIS CUP 
GROUP PLAY OFFS THEY MUST BEAT 
AUSTRIA AT HOME IF THEY HAVE TO 
MAINTAIN THEIR PLACE IN THE EEK 
ELITE GROUP OF THE WORLD 
COMPETITION IN THE ELITE GROUP 
ANDY MURRAY SHOULD BE O. K. FOR THE 
NEXT MATCH WHICH TAKES PLACE IN 
SEPTEMBER I SHOWED YOU A FEW OF 
THE HEADLINES L. WANT TO SHOW YOU 
SOME INTERESTING STUFF ON THE 
INSIDE PAGES THIS IS THE START OF 
THE OFFICIAL COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP 
SEASON IT WAS FREEZING COLD THERE 
ARE PICTURES OF RYAN SPENT SCRAPING 
OF ICE HE WAS THE FIRST WICKET TO 
FALL THIS SEASON GROUNDSMAN 
THE OTHER INTERESTING STORY WE HAVE 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT WAS ABOUT BEHAN 
CROY FOR HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST 
FAMOUS PLAYERS TO HAVE EVER PLAYED 
THE GAME JOHAN CRUYFF THERE WAS 
A GREAT AMOUNT OF MYSTERY AS TO WHY 
HE DID NOT PLAY IN THE WORLD CUP 
THE REAL REASON HE HAD AN 
INTERVIEW YESTERDAY WAS THAT 
PEOPLE BROKE INTO HIS HOUSE TIED 
UP HIS WIFE AND THREATENED HIM WITH 
A GUN HE THOUGHT I DO NOT NEED 
FOOTBALL THAT MATCH HE GAVE UP 
THERE AND THEN SUDDENLY THAT 
MYSTERY HAS ENDED DOES SIZE 
MATTER IT DOES TO THE GOVERNMENT 
AND DOCTORS WHO ARE LOCKED IN A ROW 
OVER PLANS TO BUILD SUPER SIZE G. P. 
SURGERIES THE POLYCLINICS WILL 
HOUSE G. P.'S ALONGSIDE OTHER SERVICES 
SUCH AS DIAGNOSTIC TESTING MINOR 
SURGERY AND DENTISTRY DOCTORS FEAR 
THEY WILL PROVIDE AN IMPERSONAL 
SERVICE AND THAT IS NOT WHAT 
PATIENTS WANT THE BODY WHICH 
REPRESENTS ALL N. H. S. ORGANISATIONS 
HAS CALLED FOR CALM IN THE DEBATE 
NIGEL EDWARDS FROM THE N. H. S. 
CONFEDERATION JOINS US GOOD 
MORNING TO YOU THE IDEA IS THAT 
YOU HAVE LARGER CLINICS AND LOTS OF 
THINGS ARE DONE IN THEM MANY 
PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT YOU WILL 
NOT GET THE PERSONAL SERVICE AND HE 
WILL NOT SEE THE SAME DOCTOR TWICE 
PATIENTS DO WANT TO SEE THE SAME 
DOCTOR TWICE WAS OF GENERAL 
PRACTICE IS THE MOST POPULAR PART 
OF THE N. H. S. THERE IS NO PARTICULAR 
REASON WHY THIS MODEL OUGHT TO 
DISRUPT THAT IN SOME PLACES IN 
LIVERPOOL YOU CAN ACHIEVE THE SAME 
EFFECT BY FACILITIES THAT PEOPLE 
SHARE IF YOU DO NEED A BLOOD TEST 
OR A COMPLEX BITS OF DIAGNOSTIC 
EQUIPMENT THAT YOU CANNOT PUT INTO 
HIS SURGERY THIS IS CLOSE WAY YOU 
LIVE 
IF THEY ARE LOOKING AFTER LIVE FIFTY THOUSAND PATIENTS HOW AS A PATIENT 
ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE PERSONAL 
CARE THAT YOU WANT AND ARE USED TO 
THERE ARE TWO THINGS TO SAY IN 
PLACES LIKE LIVERPOOL AND 
BIRMINGHAM WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN 
GETTING ON WITH THIS QUIETLY YOU 
CAN KEEP A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH 
YOUR G. P. IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT 
NOT EVERY PATIENT ONES THAT ALL THE 
TIME SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL VALUE 
CONVENIENCE OVER THE RELATIONSHIP A 
MORE GO SOMEWHERE WHICH IS 
CONVENIENT AND CLOSE YOU CAN 
PROVIDE THE BENEFITS WITH HIGH 
TECHNOLOGY AND PEOPLE WORKING 
TOGETHER AND PUT SPECIALISTS 
ALONGSIDE THE G. P.'S WITHOUT 
DISRUPTING BE VERY IMPORTANT 
RELATIONSHIP THAT WE NO PATIENTS 
REALLY VALUE 
G. P.'S ARE CONCERNED 
THEY WILL BE FAR HONOURABLE TO THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR YOU HAVE JUST LAID 
IT OUT OF HONOURABLE THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR CAN BE FOR SOMETHING 
LIKE THIS 
I DO NOT THINK PEOPLE 
WILL BE CLOSING SURGERIES THERE 
ARE REASONS SOMETIMES WHY YOU DO 
THAT IN GENERAL WE WANT TO 
IMPROVE ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE IT 
WILL MEAN PEOPLE NEED TO GO TO 
HOSPITAL LAST THERE IS A BIG 
ARGUMENT ABOUT THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
THE QUESTION IS DO YOU TRUST 
ORGANISATIONS THAT HAVE 
SHAREHOLDERS AND MAKE A PROFIT 
PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT IF 
G. P.'S CAN PROVIDE KIP SERVICES THEY 
ARE GOING TO WIN THOSE CONTRACTS 
ANYWAY 
PITT THE PRICE OF PETROL ANYWAY GROCERIES AND UTILITIES ARE RISING 
ARE YOU FEELING THE PRESSURE TO 
MAKE SAVINGS MORE THAN HALF OF US 
ARE MAKING CUTBACKS IN OUR LIVE 
STARS TO KEEP OUT OF THE BED IN A 
MOMENT WE WERE SPEAK TO OUR 
FINANCIAL ADVISER RED 
I HAVE 
BEEN IN THE PUB TRADE FOR TEN YEARS 
PEOPLE MAY NOT SPEND AS MUCH WHEN 
THEY ARE IN BUT DAYS STILL TO COME 
OUT 
I HAVE NOTICED PETROL L. DO OUT NOT USE THE CAR A LOT L. TEND TO 
WALK TO WORK FILLING UP THE TANK 
A YEAR AGO I COULD PUT IN TWENTY NOW 
I AM LUCKY IF I GET TWO THIRDS 
BUSINESS LIKES THIS BUSINESS LIKE 
THIS BUCKS THE TREND PEOPLE WILL 
NOT MOVE THEY WILL REDECORATE AND 
DO HOME IMPROVEMENTS IT ACTUALLY 
DOES US A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD I I WOULD NOT SAY CUSTOMERS DO NOT COME 
ANY MORE BECAUSE OF THE COST OF 
THINGS I WOULD SAY THEY POSSIBLY 
INSTEAD OF DOING A SIX WEAK 
APPOINTMENT PERHAPS THEY DO EIGHT 
WEEKS INSTEAD OF SIX 
COLIN JACKSON 
IS A FINANCIAL ADVISER WHAT HAVE 
YOU NOTICED IN TERMS OF PEOPLE 
LOOKING FOR HELP AND TIGHTENING 
THEIR BELTS 
IT IS GETTING TOUGH 
PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO THE OFFICE 
HE NOT SO MUCH WANT TO MORTGAGE BUT 
NEED HELP IN GETTING OUT OF THEIR 
CURRENT PROBLEMS FOR EXAMPLE A 
REMORTGAGE THAT IS HOW IT STARTS 
OFF 
WHAT TIPS HAVE YOU GOT FOR OFF PEOPLE TO SAVE MONEY 
THERE ISN'T 
BUT THERE IS A LOT THE MOST 
OBVIOUS IS MAKE SURE YOU ARE WITH 
YOUR BEST PROVIDER OF FOR GAS AND 
ELECTRICITY YOU CAN DO THAT ON THE 
INTERNET YOU MAY NOT NEED A LAND 
LINE AND A MOBILE 
SO LONG AS YOU 
CAN GET A SIGNAL 
I GOT MY PHONE 
BILL AND MOST OF THE PHONE BILL IS 
ON RENTAL HARDLY ANY IS ON ACTUAL 
USAGE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE JOINED 
A GYM THEY GO ONCE OR TWICE HATED 
IT AND DO NOT GO AGAIN THEY PAY 
OUT ONCE A MONTH FOR SOMETHING THEY 
ARE NOT USING TAKING A LODGER YOU 
COULD EARN SIXTY TO EIGHTY A WEEK BE 
CAREFUL WHO YOU TAKING FOR OBVIOUS 
REASONS 
ALSO TAKE AT A SMALL REASONS OVERDRAFT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
THAT WOULD BE RISKY 
I AM NOT 
SAYING TAKE IT OUT AND USE IT L. AM 
SAYING EVEN IF YOU DO NOT NEED IT 
TAKE IT OUT EVERYONE GOES INTO THE 
RED IF YOU HAVE GOT A LITTLE HER 
OVERDRAFT YOU WILL NOT PAY THE 
PENALTY ONLY USE IT IF YOU GO INTO 
THE RED ACCIDENTALLY 
WHAT IS THE 
INTEREST ON AN OVERDRAFT AS GOOD 
AS CREDIT CARDS 
IF IT IS 
UNAUTHORISED THAT IS WHEN THEY 
CHARGE YOU IF IT IS AUTHORISED 
SIX PER CENT MINUS EIGHT PER CENT CAN I SAY THE OBVIOUS 
QUESTION NOW GIVE UP SMOKING AND 
DRINKING BORING BUT THEY YOU GO I I WAS GOING TO SAY SMOKING IS NOT 
PARTICULARLY GOOD FOR YOU ANYWAY 
WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU THIS 
MORNING AND YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT 
I KNEW CUTTING BACK ON THINGS 
THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD YOUTH WILL APPEAR 
IN COURT THIS MORNING CHARGED WITH 
THE MURDER OF THE LIVERPOOL 
SCHOOLBOY RHYS JONES 
THE HEAD OF THE U. K.'S BIGGEST EXAM

YOU BELIEVE IT YOU HAVE NOT WOKEN 
UP TO WINTER EVERYWHERE BUT THERE 
IS THE SEVERE WEATHER WARNING OUT 
FOR SOUTH YORKSHIRE AND DERBYSHIRE 
CHIEFLY TO HIGHER GROUND BUT WE 
HAVE HEARD IN YORKSHIRE THERE IS 
ABOUT TEN CENTIMETRES OF SNOW IT IS 
ACROSS YORKSHIRE AND DERBYSHIRE AS 
WE SPEAK IT IS DRIFTING IN A 
WESTERLY DIRECTION SO THE WORST 
SHOULD BE OUT OF THE WAY IN THE 
NEXT HOUR BUT IT COULD CAUSE 
PROBLEMS ON THE ROADS THERE ARE 
SOME WINTRY SHOWERS AROUND THROUGH 
THAT AREA BUT HEADING INTO EAST 
ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST CORNER 
IT IS A CHILLY START WITH AN 
EASTERLY WIND STARTING TO PICK UP 
FURTHER SOUTH WE HAVE SOME 
SUNSHINE TO COME INTO THE SOUTH 
WEST AND ALSO SOUTH WALES BASED 
STIFFER WIND IN THE SOUTH WEST SO 
IT WILL FEEL FRESHER SOME OF THE 
SHOW WAS WILL FALL INTO THE EAST OF 
WALES TO HIGHER GROUND AGAIN IT 
COULD BE WINTRY FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND SCOTLAND IT IS A 
FROSTY START BUT BRIGHT WITH 
SUNSHINE COMING THROUGH IT SHOULD 
STAY FIND MACRO INTO NORTH WEST AND 
SCOTLAND THE SHOWERS SHOULD EASE 
FOR ITS TIME BEFORE MORE SHOWERY 
RAIN OVERNIGHT WE WILL HAVE THIS 
RAIN MOVING ACROSS THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND NORTHERN IRELAND AND DRIFT 
FOR A TIME INTO SOUTH EAST SCOTLAND 
AGAIN THERE COULD BE SLEET AND 
SNOW TO HIGHER GROUND IN THAT NOT 
AS COLD TONIGHT PATCHY RAIN PUSHES 
INTO THE SOUTH FOR TOMORROW AND WE 
ARE GOING TO SEE A CLOUDY DAY 
GENERALLY ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND 
SHOULD SEE THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE 
TOMORROW ALSO THE BEST OF THE 
WARMTH 
A QUICK LOOK AT THE PAPERS I AM 
ASKING THE FRONT PAGE OF THE 
GUARDIAN WHO SAYS HE WENT OUT OF 
THE APPRENTICE LAST NIGHT 
AHEAD OF ONE OF THE U. K.'S LEADING 
EXAM BOARDS SAY FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS 
COULD BE LEFT WITH WORTHLESS 
QUALIFICATIONS BECAUSE OF FLAWS IN 
THE GOVERNMENT'S FLAGSHIP DIPLOMACY 
SYSTEM SYSTEM THE TELEGRAPH IT IS THE POPE'S 
VISIT TO AMERICA OVERSHADOWING 
SOMEWHAT GORDON BROWN'S VISIT 
ALSO DRINKING ACCELERATE THE ONSET 
OF ALZHEIMER'S 
THE DAILY MAIL HALF THE COUNTRY 
HASN'T HAD ANY DENTAL CARE ON THE 
N. H. S. IN THE PAST TWO YEARS 
ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES 
GORDON BROWN IS TALKING ABOUT THE 
WORLD ROBERT MUGABE 
THE DAILY EXPRESS ON A STORY WE 
LEAD WITH YESTERDAY ON A REPORT 
FOR CHIEF POLICE OFFICERS WHICH SAY 
IMMIGRANTS HAD NOT BROUGHT MORE 
CRIME THE EXPRESS AND REACHES AN 
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CONCLUSION FROM 
THE SAME REPORT 
HOW TO STIR YOUR TEA WITH NO 
TEASPOON THE FRENCH HAVE INVENTED 
A CUP YOU PUT THE SUGAR IN AND 
SWIRL IT AROUND LIKE A GLASS OF 
COGNAC COGNAC I WAS WORRIED BEFORE THE FRENCH 
WERE TEACHING US TO MAKE TEA 
I LIKE TEASPOONS MYSELF I GIVE YOU 
SOMETHING TO DO WHILE YOU ARE 
STARING STARING YOU ALWAYS LIKE STARING AND IT IS 
NOT JUST TEA WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
AND YOU PLAN TO EASE THE SQUEEZE ON 
LENDING BETWEEN BANKS IT COULD 
BRING DOWN THE COST OF BORROWING 
AND MAKE MORTGAGES AND OVER TRUFFES 
CHEAPER BANKS USE THE ASSETS THEY 
OWN LIKE THE RIGHTS TO FUTURE 
MORTGAGES TO BORROW FROM OTHER 
BANKS THAT GUARANTEES TO THE BANK 
MAKING THE LOAN IT WILL GET ITS 
MONEY BACK BUT BECAUSE OF 
AMERICA'S MORTGAGE CRISIS IT MAKES 
BANKS ARE LESS CERTAIN HOW MUCH 
THOSE ASSETS ARE WORTH THAT MAKES 
THE BANKS NERVOUS ABOUT LENDING TO 
THE CHARGE MORE THEY WILL BE ABLE 
TO SWAP THOSE MORTGAGES ON THEIR 
BOOKS FOR GOVERNMENT BOMBS THEY 
ARE SEEN AS SAFER BECAUSE THEIR 
VALUE IS GUARANTEED BOMBS DOES 
THIS MEAN WE HAVE BAILED OUT THE 
BANKS ONCE AGAIN THE FEAR IS IF 
THE BANK'S MORTGAGES ARE WORTHLESS 
WE HAVE SWAPPED GOVERNMENT 
INVESTMENTS FOR WORTHLESS PAPER 
WE HAVE SWAPPED GOVERNMENT INVESTMENTS FOR WORTHLESS PAPER 
THERE IS TALK TO KATIE FROM A 
MORTGAGE BROKER 
GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THE THE BANK OF ENGLAND SAYS IT WILL 
STRUCTURE THIS IN WAY SO TAX 
PAYERS ARE NOT AT RISK BUT HOW 
REALISTICALLY ARE THEY GOING TO BE 
ABLE TO DO THAT 
THE IMPORTANT 
THING IS THEY COULD BUNDLE UP THE 
MORTGAGE PACKAGES IN A WAY THEY 
COULD HAVE SOME IDEA OF PREDICTION 
OF WHAT THEY WILL BE WORSE IF THEY 
ARE SWAPPING A THREE YEAR BOND 
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT WILL BE WORTH 
A LOT OF MONEY TO TRADE ON THE 
MARKET WHICH WILL EASE OF THE 
LIQUIDITY THE LENDERS CAN ACCESS 
WE DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO BE 
LANDED WITH AN ASSET THAT MIGHT NOT 
BE WORTH ANYTHING AT THE END SO 
THE GOVERNMENT CAN BREAK DOWN THE 
VALUE USING A KITE MARK ING SYSTEM 
OR A GOLD MARKING SYSTEM GOLD 
STANDARD SYSTEM AND THEY WILL BE 
ABLE TO LOOK AFTER THE DEBT AND IT 
SHOULDN'T PUT THE TAX PAYERS TOO 
MUCH AT RISK THEY ARE PRICING IT 
CLEVERLY 
PRICING IS KEY BECAUSE CLEVERLY IF THE BANK SAYS IT HAS ONE HUNDRED BILLION 
WORTH OF ASSETS IT DOES NOT MEAN 
IT WILL GET ONE HUNDRED BILLION WORTH OF 
GOVERNMENT HELP IN RETURN 
THE S. 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND MIGHT ONLY GIVE 
ME NINETY FIVE MILLION WORTH OF BONDS SO 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND COULD MAKE 
PROFITS FOR THE TAX PAYERS 
THIS IS 
STOPPING SHORT OF WHAT IS CALLED 
DETOXIFICATION TAKING THE DIRTY 
MORTGAGES OF THE BANK'S BOOKS AND 
TAXPAYERS CLEANING THEM AND TAKING 
THE LAST 
ALLOTT ON MORTGAGES ARE 
NOT NECESSARILY THAT DIRTY A LOT 
OF IT IS GOOD BUSINESS SO DON'T BE 
TOO WORRIED IT IS A NATIONALISATION 
OR A BEA OUT OF ANY GREAT EXTENT 
THE BOMBS SENT HIM IN EXCHANGE 
COULD MAKE A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE 
LENDERS GET THE MARKET'S GOING 
AGAIN WITHOUT PUTTING THE 
GOVERNMENT TOO MUCH AT RISK 
THANKS FOR JOINING US AND WALKING 
US THROUGH THAT STORY MORE 
BUSINESS AFTER SEVEN A M.

EDEXEL SAYS TEACHERS WILL NOT BE 
ADEQUATE BE CHANGED TRAINED BY 
THE TIME THE SCHEME IS LAUNCHED IN

KEY NEW QUALIFICATION RISKS FAILURE 
JERRY JARVIS THEY ARE DESIGNED 
TO BE A MIX OF PRACTICAL AND 
ACADEMIC SKILLS THEY WILL NOT 
REPLACE A LEVELS AND GCSES THE 
GOVERNMENT THINKS IT WILL BECOME 
THE MOST POPULAR QUALIFICATION 
EVENTUALLY TEACHERS ARE NOT BEING 
TRAINED PROPERLY AND SCHOOLS ARE 
NOT SURE HOW TO TEACH PARTS OF THE 
DIPLOMA OF BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY 
BROAD QUALIFICATIONS AND PUPILS 
HAVE TO PASS EACH PART INDIVIDUALLY 
HE IS WORRIED THAT HUGE NUMBERS OF 
PEOPLE WILL FAIL THERE HAS BEEN A 
SWIFT RESPONSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT 
THIS MORNING THEY HAVE SAID TO 
SUGGEST THEY ARE IN DISARRAY AND 
WORTHLESS IS A COMPLETE NONSENSE 
IT SAYS ITS PLANS ARE ON TRACK 
GORDON BROWN IS TO MEET PRESIDENT 
BUSH IN WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS THE 
DEEPENING GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS 
HE WILL HOLD A SERIES OF PRIVATE 
MEETINGS WITH THE THREE MAIN 
CONTENDERS HOPING TO SUCCEED MR. 
BUSH THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS CLOSE 
TO AGREEING PLAN TO EASE THE LOG 
JAM IN MORTGAGE LENDING IT WILL 
ALLOW BANKS TO SWAP THEIR MORTGAGE 
BACKED ASSETS FOR GOVERNMENT BONDS 
THE FIRST THING MANY PEOPLE KNEW 
ABOUT THE GLOBAL CREDIT CRISIS WAS 
LONG QUEUES OUTSIDE BRANCHES OF 
NORTHERN ROCK PEOPLE IN THE U. S. HAD 
BEEN GIVEN MORTGAGES THEY COULD NOT 
AFFORD THAT MEANT BANKS WERE 
WORRIED ABOUT LENDING TO EACH OTHER 
AND THE GLOBAL CREDIT MARKET HAS 
DRIED UP THAT BLOCKAGE IN THE 
CREDIT PIKE MEANS BANKS CANNOT GET 
ENOUGH CASH IN THE WHOLESALE 
MARKETS TO LEND TO US NOW THE 
GOVERNMENT IS GETTING ITS PLUNGER 
OUT IT IS GOING TO SWAP THE 
POSSIBLY BAD MORTGAGE ASSETS THE 
GAP THE BANKS HAVE FOR GOVERNMENT 
BONDS BANKS WILL BE ABLE TO USE 
THESE BONDS TO GET OTHER BANKS TO 
LEND TO THEM THAT WILL MEAN THE 
FLOW OF 
CREDIT 
WILL GET 
THROUGH 
US IN THE FORM OF CHEAPER MORTGAGES 
THE E. S. T. RATHER WORRIES ME IT IS A 
DESPERATE NEED FOR LIQUIDITY OF 
CREDIT TO GET THE BANKING SYSTEM OF 
WORKING AGAIN THERE IS A REAL 
DANGER THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS 
BAILING OUT THE BANKS THE THE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING ON MORTGAGE 
ASSETS WHICH MAY TURN OUT TO BE 
VERY BAD INVESTMENTS TO PROTECT 
TAX PAYERS IT IS LIKELY TO PAY 
LESS FOR THE ASSETS THAN IT IS 
WORTH HOW MUCH LESS IS TRICKY TWO 
MATCH AND TAX PAYERS COULD END UP 
FOOTING THE BILL HEALTH MANAGERS 
ARE BACKING GOVERNMENT PLANS TO 
INTRODUCE POLYCLINICS ACROSS

DEVELOP B. C. THE DISEASE BY HIS 
EARLIER THAN THOSE WHO DO NOT DRINK 
AT ALL PEOPLE WITH HIGH 
CHOLESTEROL LEVELS IN HER EARLY 
FORTIES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE 
DISEASE THE OLYMPIC TORCH HAS 
ARRIVED IN DELHI AMID TIGHT 
SECURITY IT IS FAIR ON THE LATEST 
LEG OF THE CONTROVERSIAL TOUR AHEAD 
OF THE BEIJING GAMES WAS THAT THE 
POLICE HAVE ARRESTED A NUMBER OF 
TIBETAN EXCISE WHO TRIED TO STORM 
THE CHINESE EMBASSY IN DELHI YOU 
MIGHT GET BORED OF HEARING ARE FULL 
SOUP VOICES EVERY MORNING BUT WE 
HAVE ANYONE FOR YOU IT HAS NOT 
BEEN HAD FOR THIRTY THOUSAND YEARS 
RESEARCHERS IN AMERICA HAVE 
RECREATED THE VOICE OF NEANDERTHAL 
MAN BY RECONSTRUCTING HIS VOCAL 
TRACTS BASED ON FOSSIL SKULLS HE 
IS WHAT HE WOULD HAVE SOUNDED LIKE 
THERE WE ARE LET'S TRY IT AGAIN E. E. IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THOSE 
BUSES ON QUIZ GAME DOESN'T IT 
QUESTOR OUT SO FAR SCIENTISTS HAVE 
ONLY ENGINEERED IT TO SAY E. 
DOESN'T IT THEY INTEND TO 
CONSTRUCT AN ENTIRE NEANDERTHALS 
SENTENCE I DO NOT KNOW WHY THEY 
BOTHER LATER IT IS THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH TAKING A BITE OUT OF YOUR 
FINANCES LATER IS THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH N. H. S. MANAGERS ARE CALLING 
FOR A CALM AND BALANCED DEBATE OVER 
GOVERNMENT PLANS FOR G. P. C. THE 
SURGERIES THE POLYCLINICS WILL 
HOUSE FAMILY DOCTORS ALONGSIDE 
DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND DENTISTRY 
MANY DOCTORS SAY IT WILL PROVIDE AN 
IMPERSONAL SERVICE WHICH PATIENTS 
WILL NOT WANT PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
ACTUALLY IT GIVES PATIENTS BETTER 
VALUE AND BETTER SERVICE WHAT YOU 
THINK 
WE BELIEVE WE CAN GET BETTER THINK VALUE AND BETTER SERVICE BY 
BUILDING ON WHAT IS THERE MANY 
PRACTICES WORK VERY CLOSELY 
TOGETHER AND REQUIRE ALL THE 
FACILITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED IN THE 
POLYCLINIC IT CANNOT DO IT WITHOUT 
DESTABILISING THE EXISTING SERVICE 
IT CAN DO IT 
WHY DO YOU SAY 
THAT 
WITH THE PLANS THAT ARE BEING THAT FORCED THROUGH BY THE GOVERNMENT 
CAN AND YOU COULD HAVE POLYCLINICS 
WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT SMALL AND 
MEDIUM SIZED PRACTICES MIGHT CLOSE 
IT WOULD FEEL LIKE GOING TO A 
HOSPITAL RATHER THAN A CENTURY ONE I AM TOLD IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT 
SMALLER SURGERIES WILL NOT HAVE TO 
CLOSE 
IN THE LUCKETTI DOCUMENT CLOSE THAT N. H. S. MANAGERS HAVE PRODUCED IS 
TODAY THERE ARE THREE MODELS 
THE SMALLEST MODEL WOULD BE UPWARDS 
OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PATIENTS THAT IS A VERY 
LARGE PRACTICE IT WITH ME IN THE 
WHOLESALE CLOSURE OF MANY PRACTICES 
PATIENTS ARE BEING PROMISED BETTER 
TREATMENT OR SOONER TREATMENT THAT 
IS BAKE IT THING ISN'T IT 
IT IS 
WE WANT TO SEE GREATER INVESTMENT 
A GOOD DO NOT PRIVATISE IT IS IS IT NOT ABOUT SOME DOCTORS WANTING 
TO HOLD ON TO THE POWER THEMSELVES 
NOW TATTLE 
WE SEE WHAT PATIENTS 
GENUINELY VALUE AT ALL THERE IS 
A RISK THAT WE CAN LEASE THAT OVER 
THE NEXT FEW YEARS PEOPLE CAN HAVE 
AN IMPERSONAL SERVICE IT WILL NOT 
BE WANTED 
IN THE SUN THERE IS A REPORT ABOUT 
THE CONDITIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO 
LIVE IN BEFORE THEY GO INTO SERVICE 
THEY ARE ROTTING HATS IT ASKS THE 
MINISTRY OF DEFENCE HAVE YOU NO 
SHAME MORE PICTURES ON THE INSIDE 
IN THE INDEPENDENT THERE IS 
PICTURE OF WHAT THEY CALL ABBEY 
FIELD OF GOLD THE COST OF RURAL 
LAND IS SOARING TO RECORD HIGHS 
BECAUSE OF OVERSEAS BUYERS AND 
PEOPLE LEAVING THE CITIES THE 
TIMES FOCUSES ON GORDON BROWN'S 
REMARKS YESTERDAY THAT OF ROBERT 
MUGABE PEAK TIMES ON THE FRONT 
PAGES OF THE DAILY MAIL THEY HAD A 
STORY ABOUT N. H. S. DENTISTS THEY SAY 
HALF THE POPULATION HAS RECEIVED NO 
DENTAL CARE ON THE N. H. S. IN THE PAST 
FEW YEARS DENISE VAN OUT AND SAID 
SHE HAD A SUNBED ADDICTION WHEN SHE 
WAS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY AND THAT HAS SCARRED HER 
FACE A FULL LIFE THE DAILY 
TELEGRAPH HAD PICTURE OF THE POPE 
WITH GEORGE BRIDGE FOR LIFE 
WITH GEORGE BUSH L. HARDLY DARE 
HOLD UP THE GUARDIAN WILL BE 
TALKING TO THE PERSON WHO HAS BEEN 
FIRED FROM THE APPRENTICE SLATER 
THE EXAM CHIEF IS SAYING BE RIVALS 
TOOK A LEVELS ARE IN DISARRAY 
LATER THE FRENCH ARE TELLING US 
HAVE TO DRINK TEA ALMOST THEY 
HAVE COME UP WITH A NEW KIND OF 
TEACUP WHICH SAYS YOU COULD DRINK 
YOUR BEVERAGE WITHOUT STIRRING IT 
YOU WOBBLE IT ABOUT A BIT FOSTERED 
YOU DO NOT NEED TEASPOON LIKE 
COGNAC ABOUT A BIT HOW DOES 
THAT MAKE IT BETTER AS LONG AS 
THEY ARE NOT TELLING US HOW TO MAKE 
TEA I DO NOT MIND STILL TO COME 
HAVE YOU BEEN DISCUSSING MOVING 
HOME 
HE IS NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO HOME DO 
WHY MEDIUMS AND CLAIRVOYANCE DO HAVE LOOKED INTO THEIR FUTURE AND 
THEY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT THEY 
SEE 
I THINK YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR SEE DEPTH WITH REGRET YOU ARE FIRED 
HERE WAS NOT UP TO THE TASK WE 
WILL MEET THE LATEST APPRENTICE 
CANDIDATES BEING GIVEN THE BOOT BY 
SIR ALAN SUGAR AFTER NINE A M. 
YOU DON'T HEAR SIR ALAN SUGAR 
SAYING THAT WERE VERY OFTEN REGRET 
NOW THE WEATHER 
SNOW THAT IS WHAT I HAVE TO TALK 
ABOUT IT IS MISERABLE IN COUPLE 
OF PART OF THE COUNTRY 
PARTICULARLY IN SOUTH YORKSHIRE AND 
DERBYSHIRE WE HAVE HAD UNOFFICIAL 
REPORTS OF TEN CENTIMETRES OF LYING 
SNOW THE SNOW SHOWERS ARE NOT 
LIKELY TO LINGER MUCH LONGER THAN 
ANOTHER HOUR OR SO ELSEWHERE 
BREAKS IN THE CLOUD AND SUNNY 
SPELLS AROUND YORKSHIRE 
STRETCHING DOWN INTO DERBYSHIRE AND 
PERHAPS THE NORTH MIDLANDS BUT 
THEY ARE DRIFTING IN A WESTERLY 
FASHION TOWARDS NORTH WALES EAST 
ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST CORNER 
IT IS PLEASANT SUNSHINE AROUND 
THIS MORNING A FRESHER EASTERLY 
WIND WILL MAKE IT FEEL CHILLY TODAY 
THE SAME APPLIES LONGER SOUTH 
COAST AND CORNWALL AND DEVON THE 
SAME FOR SOUTH WALES THERE IS THE 
SLEET AND SNOW SHOWERS TO HIGHER 
GROUND OF NORTH WALES NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND SCOTLAND THE QUIETER 
DAY FOR YOU DECENT SPELLS OF 
SUNSHINE EXPECTED THROUGH THE 
MORNING AND LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN 
THE FAR NORTH WEST OF SCOTLAND 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY MORE CLOUD 
RUNNING IN OFF THE NORTH SEA 
ANOTHER BATCH OF CLOUD STARTS TO 
MOVE IN PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO THE 
NORTH EAST TEMPERATURES EIGHT TO 
ELEVEN DEGREES OVERNIGHT THE SHOWERS 
WILL CONTINUE IN THE SOUTH EAST OF 
SCOTLAND CLOUD AND RAIN NUDGING UP 
TO THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND AND 
WALES AS WELL NOT AS COLD AND 
NIGHT AS IT HAS BEEN IT WILL START 
OFF CLOUDY AND DAMP THE BEST OF 
THE SUNSHINE SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN 
IRELAND FURTHER SOUTH STIFF EASTERLY WIND 
I DO APOLOGISE I DON'T KNOW HOW I 
COULD CONFUSE YOU WITH THAT OTHER 
BLOKE BLOKE IT'S O. K. I WILL CALL YOU DERMOT IN 
A MOMENT 
NOW IT IS DECLAN 
THIS IS SENSATIONAL STORY JUST 
BROKEN IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES THE 
FAIR TRADING WATCHDOG HAS ACCUSED 
ONE HUNDRED TWELVE YES ONE HUNDRED TWELVE FOR BUILDING FIRMS OF 
PRICE FIXING IN COMPETITION FOR 
LOCAL AUTHORITY BUILDING WORKS 
THEY HAVE NAMED THE ONE HUNDRED TWELVE COMPANIES 
THEY ARE LISTED ON THE WEBSITE 
THEY SAID THEY WERE ENGAGED IN WHAT 
IT CALLS COVER PRICING THAT IS 
WHERE TWO COMPANIES TALK TO EACH 
OTHER ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY ARE 
BIDDING FOR PARTICULAR BID OF LOCAL 
AUTHORITY WORK AND ONE PUTS IN 
PRICE THAT IS OFF THE SCALE TOO 
HIGH SO IT DOES NOT GET THE WORK 
AND THE OTHER COMPANY GET THE JOB 
IN THIS INSTEAD THE UPSHOT IS 
THE LOCAL AUTHORITY ENDS UP PAYING 
MORE FOR THE WORK THAN THEY 
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE DONE SO THE 
OFT THIS MORNING NAMING ONE HUNDRED TWELVE 
BUILDING COMPANIES IT ACCUSES OF 
FIXING THE PRICE OF CONSTRUCTION 
WORK FOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES THIS IS 
A STORY WE HAD WHISPER ABOUT A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WE TALKED A 
LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT THEN FOR THIS 
IS THE OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF 
THAT MORE ON THAT LATER 
THE OTHER STORY DEVELOPING HIS FROM 
WHO SMITH THE HIGH STREET 
NEWSAGENT PROFIT IS UP THE AMOUNT 
OF MONEY HE MAKES UP BY EIGHT PER CENT TO SIXTY FOUR 
MILLION SALES IN ITS STORES ARE 
DOWN SHOPS OPEN FOR A YEAR OR MORE 
HAVE SEEN SALES DROP BY TWO PER CENT THE 
COMPANY SAYS IT IS DELIBERATE PART 
OF ITS STRATEGY TO REBALANCE THE 
MIX OF STUFF IT SELLS IN ITS SHOPS 
SHARES IN LONDON UP YESTERDAY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE 
BECAUSE OF THE HOPE THE GOVERNMENT 
WAS COMING TOGETHER WITH A PLAN TO 
EASE LENDING BETWEEN BANKS THAT IS 
THE PLAN WE TOLD YOU ABOUT TEN 
MINUTES AGO 
IT SEEMS LIKE AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM 
CARS THAT CAN RUN ON FUEL THAT IS 
POLLUTION FREE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY 
FRIENDLY FRIENDLY SCIENTISTS ARE WORKING ON PROJECT 
THAT COULD SEE IT BEING A REALITY 
THE SARAH CAMPBELL CAN TELL US MORE 
I AM HERE THIS IS FILLING UP WITH 
A DIFFERENCE THIS IS THE COUNTRY'S 
ONLY HYDROGEN FILLING STATION FOR 
CARS WE WILL SEE HOW EASY IT IS IN 
A MOMENT THIS IS PROFESSOR KENDAL 
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM 
WHO WILL EXPLAIN THIS IS THE ONLY 
ONE IN THE COUNTRY 
YES SEVERAL OF 
THEM ARE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE 
HYDROGEN IS A NEW FUEL CLEAN AND 
EFFICIENT AND IT CAN HELP US 
PRESERVE OUR CLEAN CAMPUS AND 
PREVENT GLOBAL WARMING TAKE US 
THROUGH THE PROCESS 
IT IS LIKE FILLING A PETROL VEHICLE 
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO TAKE 
PRECAUTIONS BECAUSE IT IS A 
FLAMMABLE GAS THE VEHICLE IS 
BERTHED SO WE DON'T HAVE STATIC 
CHARGES OR SPARKS THE NOZZLE IS 
PLACED INTO THE RECEIVER ABOUT ONE 
KILOGRAM GOES IN IN A FEW MINUTES 
IT IS NOT AS EASY AS IT LOOKS YOU YOU HAVE TO SEAL THE INSTRUMENT CHECKS 
IF THERE IS A SEAL IF IT DOES NOT 
SEAL IT DOES NOT WORK 
IT SOUNDS 
AMAZING THAT WITH HYDROGEN THE 
ONLY BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS CAR IS 
WATER 
YES IT IS FANTASTIC SO WE WATER DON'T HAVE ANY NASTY POLLUTANTS 
HOW DOES IT WORK THOUGH HYDROGEN HYDROGEN GOES INTO THE CAR AND THERE IS A 
FUEL CELL IN THE CAR IT RUNS ON 
HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN FROM THE AIR 
CAN DRIVE THE ELECTRICITY WHAT WHAT ABOUT SAFETY 
HYDROGEN IS VERY 
INTERESTING IT IS VERY FLAMMABLE 
THERE HAVE BEEN ACCIDENTS IN THE 
PAST BUT ONE OF THE REASONS WE 
HAVE THIS FILLING STATION IS IT HAS 
A STRONG SAFETY RECORD WE HAVE 
HELPED TO DO ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND FILLING 
OPERATIONS 
THESE ARE BEING USED OPERATIONS ABROAD YOU HAVE THIS TWO YEAR 
TESTING PLAN AT THE UNIVERSITY 
COULD WE ALL BE GOING DOWN TO THE 
GARAGE FORECOURT AND FILLING UP 
WITH HYDROGEN 
I BELIEVE SO YES 
UNTIL YOU HAVE FILLING STATIONS 
YOU DON'T HAVE VEHICLES WE HAVE 
FIVE OF THESE VEHICLES ON CAMPUS 
AND WE HOPE TO HAVE TWENTY WE HAVE A 
FLEET OF TWENTY DIESEL VEHICLES RIGHT 
NOW AND WE WANT THESE TO REPLACE 
THEM 
THERE ARE SOME FILLING THEM STATIONS PLANNED FOR LONDON AND 
THERE ARE ANOTHER TWELVE PLANS FOR THE 
REST OF THE U. K. BY TWO THOUSAND TEN IT IS 
AMAZING STUFF 
IT WILL BE A LONG 
QUEUE WITH JUST THIRTEEN FILLING 
STATIONS STATIONS IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BE FUNNY YOU 
COULD SAY THEY SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT 
COMING BUT CLAIRVOYANCE AND 
SPIRITUALIST SAY NEW CONSUMER LAWS 
ARE NO LAUGHING MATTER 
THEY CLAIM THEY CAN BE SUED BY 
PEOPLE WHO CLAIM THEY WERE TOLD 
SOMETHING THAT TURNED OUT TO BE 
WRONG THEY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS 
AREN'T THEY 
THEY ARE SERIOUS AND WORRIED IN 
THE PAST IF YOU FELT YOU HAD BEEN 
CONNED BY THEM AND HE WANTED TO 
TAKE THEM TO COURT IT WAS UP TO 
YOU TO PROVE THEY HAD INTENDED TO 
MISLEAD YOU IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
PROVE WHAT ANYBODY'S INTENTIONS ARE 
NEXT MONTH THEY ARE CONSUMER 
PROTECTION AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW YOU 
WERE MISLED THAT IS EASIER 
SPIRITUALISTS IN PARTICULAR HAVE 
LOOKED AT THESE NEW LAWS AND THEY 
HAVE STARTED TO PANIC AS I HAVE 
BEEN FINDING OUT 
WE ARE NOT HERE TO DO ANY FORTUNE 
TELLING WE ARE BRINGING THROUGH 
LOVED ONES FROM HEAVEN 
A MEETING 
OF THE SPIRITUALIST CHURCH IN 
LONDON 
I HAVE A GENTLEMAN WHO LONDON PASSED WITH A HEART CONDITION I 
HAVE A FATHER FIGURE 
THIS MAN 
CLAIMS TO BE GETTING MESSAGES FROM 
THIS WOMAN'S DEAD FATHER 
HAVE YOU 
BEEN DISCUSSING MOVING HOME YES YES HE IS NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO 
FOR SPIRITUALISTS ARE NERVOUS 
BECAUSE THEY TAKE DONATIONS THEY 
ARE CLASSED AS TRADERS AND COME 
UNDER A NEW CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW 
THEY SAY IT CAN LEAVE THEM OPEN TO 
LEGAL ACTION FROM DISGRUNTLED 
CUSTOMERS 
ANYTHING WE SAY COULD BE CUSTOMERS MISCONSTRUED AND END UP WITH 
SOMEONE FEELING UNSATISFIED OR 
UNHAPPY AND AT THE END OF THE DAY 
TAKE LEGAL ACTION WE ARE A 
RELIGION A WAY OF LIFE 
THE NEW LAW IS DUE TO COME INTO 
EFFECT NEXT MONTH AND IT WILL BEEF 
UP PROTECTION TO CONSUMERS IT WILL 
MEAN ANY TRADERS INCLUDING 
PSYCHICS MEDIUMS AND CLAIRVOYANCE 
CAN BE PROSECUTED IF THEY MISLEAD 
THE AVERAGE CONSUMER GROUPS LIKE 
THAT PSYCHICS TO EXAMINE THE CLAIMS 
OF MEDIUMS SAY THEY ARE ALL 
MISLEADING BECAUSE EVERYTHING THEY 
SAY CANNOT BE PROVED SHOULD THE 
SPIRITUALISTS START TO PANIC 
TRADING STANDARDS SAY PROBABLY NOT 
SO LONG AS THE CLAIMS THEY MAKE ARE 
HONEST 
OUR LIST OF PEOPLE TO GO HONEST AFTER IS THE GENUINELY ROGUE 
TRADERS THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO 
SHOULD LOOK OUT UNDER THESE NEW 
RULES AND SPIRITUALIST CHURCHES AND 
OTHERS THIS ISN'T DESIGNED TO 
ATTACK THEM ALL TO GO AFTER THEM IN 
ANY WAY 
PEOPLE WE HAVE SPOKEN TO 
WHO VISIT PSYCHICS SAME MORE 
PROTECTION ISN'T REALLY NEEDED 
THIS LADY HAD A NUMBER OF READINGS 
AFTER HER HUSBAND DIED FROM CANCER 
TRAGICALLY YOUNG 
I THINK I WAS 
GOING HOPING SOMEBODY WOULD TELL ME 
EVERYTHING WOULD BE O. K. L. L. KNEW THEY 
COULDN'T TELL ME THAT BUT THEY 
WERE GIVING THE OPTIMISM FOR THE 
FUTURE 
DID YOU FEEL EXPLOITED NO FUTURE NO I DIDN'T I CAME OUT FEELING 
OPTIMISTIC I WENT IN KNOWING THAT 
WHAT 
THEY MIGHT 
SAY MIGHT BE DUE 
AND MIGHT NOT BE TRUE NEVERTHELESS NEVERTHELESS THE CLAIMS AND ADVERTS MADE BY 
PSYCHICS AND MEDIUMS WILL BE 
SCRUTINISED CLOSELY FOR MISLEADING 
STATEMENTS MANY ARE ALREADY 
PUTTING DISCLAIMERS IN THE SMALL 
PRINT SAYING WHAT THEY OFFER IS 
MAINLY ENTERTAINMENT 
THE DIFFICULTY WITH THAT FOR A 
SPIRITUALIST IS IT IS NOT 
ENTERTAINMENT FOR THEM IS IT THEY THEY CANNOT PUT A DISCLAIMER SAYING IT 
IS FOR FUN OR AN EXPERIMENT THEY 
BELIEVE IT IT IS PART OF THEIR WAY 
OF LIFE THEY BELIEVE THEY HEAR 
MESSAGES FROM THE DEAD L. THINK 
THERE ARE COUPLE OF SAVING GRACES 
FOR SPIRITUALISTS WHO WILL 
COMPLAIN EVERYONE WHO GOES TO 
THESE CHURCHES BELIEVE PEOPLE LIKE 
THAT LADY IN THE FILM GO WITH 
THEIR EYES OPEN THAT THEY MAY BE 
TOLD THINGS THAT ARE NOT TRUE AND 
THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO COMPLAIN THE 
OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING ARE AFTER 
PEOPLE WHO PREYED ON THE VULNERABLE 
AND WANT THEIR MONEY THEY ARE NOT 
AFTER SPIRITUALISTS WHO WOULD JUST 
TAKE A DONATION THERE ARE 
THOUSANDS OF THESE LETTERS SENT OUT 
WHO CLAIMED TO BE FROM CLAIRVOYANCE 
AND MEDIUMS 
ACT QUICKLY A SILENT THREAT IS 
HANGING OVER YOU THEN THEY GO ON 
TO SAY GIVE US YOUR MONEY 
FORTY MILLION WAS MADE DOING THIS 
THING IN TWO THOUSAND SIX FROM THE BRITISH 
PUBLIC IT IS THIS THE TRADING 
STANDARDS WANT TO STAMP OUT 
LATER THEY MIGHT BE PRICKLY 
CUSTOMERS BUT THEY ARE THE LATEST 
PET SHOULD THEY BE 
PYGMY HEDGEHOGS MANY PEOPLE WANT 
TO KEEP THEM AT HOME AND A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT

AT MANCHESTER CITY IS IN DOUBT L. 
SHOULD ALSO SHOW YOU THE INSIDE 
PAGES OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH 
DESPITE THE WEATHER THE CRICKET 
SEASON GOT UP AND RUNNING YESTERDAY 
SOME OF THE IMAGES OF THE NEW 
COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP ANDREW 
FLINTOFF IN A FALSE FULL FLIGHT 
PEOPLE SCRAPING ICE OFF THE PITCH 
LET'S KEEP OUR CHINS UP THE OTHER 
ONE WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING 
THE INSIDE PAGE OF THE GUARDIAN 
AFTER THIRTY YEARS THE TREES BEHIND 
JOHAN CRUYFF'S'S ABSENCE FROM THE 
WORLD CUP IN ARGENTINA FOR SO MANY 
PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE DID 
NOT AGREE WITH THE SPONSORS 
OR HE 
HAD FALLEN OUT WITH THE STAFF HE 
WAS SPEAKING YESTERDAY AND HE SAID 
PEOPLE BROKE INTO MY HOUSE IN 
BARCELONA TIED UP MY WIFE AND 
THREATENED ME WITH A GUN L. THOUGHT 
IT IS ENOUGH L. DO NOT WANT THIS 
SORT OF PRESSURE HE DECIDED NOT TO 
BE OWED TO THE WORLD CUP HE 
CONTINUED HIS CAREER HE CAME BACK 
IN AMERICA AND BECAME A COACH WE 
DID NOT SEE THIS SORT OF TALENT AT 
THE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WORLD CUP FOR ANYONE WHO 
HAS NOT SEEN JOHAN CRUYFF THIS IS 
THE MAN WHO HAD SO MUCH TO BRING TO 
MY TEAM HE WAS BY FAR AND AWAY ONE 
OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST PLAYERS 
NOW THAT MYSTERY HAS BEEN SOLD 
WITH THE PRICE OF PETROL GROCERIES 
AND UTILITIES RISING ARE YOU 
FEELING PRESSURED TO MAKE SAVINGS 
ACCORDING TO A SURVEY HALF OF US 
ARE MAKING CUTBACKS TO ALAN KNIGHT 
STARS TO KEEP OUT OF THE RED IN A 
MOMENT WE WILL SPEAK TO COLIN 
JACKSON OUR LIFESTYLES LET'S 
HEAR HOW PEOPLE IN NEWCASTLE ARE 
TIGHTENING THEIR BELTS 
I HAVE BEEN 
IN THE PUB TRADE FOR TEN YEARS 
EVERYONE STILL COMES TO THE PUBS 
THEY MAY NOT SPEND AS MUCH WHEN 
THEY ARE IN BUT THEY ARE STILL HERE 
I HAVE NOTICED PETROL DO NOT USE 
THE CAR A LOT TEND TO WALK TO 
WORK FILLING UP THE TANK A YEAR 
AGO I COULD HAVE PUT TWENTY IN THE 
TANK AND IT WOULD BE FULL NOW IT 
IS JUST TWO THIRDS 
BUSINESS LIKE 
THIS BUCKS THE TREND PEOPLE START 
DOING THINGS AT HOME PEOPLE WILL 
NOT MOVE THEY WILL REDECORATE AND 
HAVE HOME IMPROVEMENTS IT DOES US 
A BIT OF GOOD 
I WOULD NOT SAY THE 
CUSTOMERS HAVE STOPPED COMING 
BECAUSE OF THE COST OF THINGS BUT I 
WOULD SAY THAT THEY POSSIBLY 
INSTEAD OF DOING A SIX WEEK 
APPOINTMENT PERHAPS THEY TOOK 
EIGHT WEEKS INSTEAD OF A SIX COLIN COLIN JACKSON AND THE EDITING OF GOOD 
HOUSEKEEPING MAGAZINE ARE BOTH WITH 
US THIS MORNING WE WILL COME TO 
YOU A SECOND ABOUT ESPECIALLY WHAT 
WOMEN CAN DO BEAUTY TREATMENTS AND 
THAT SORT OF THING COST A LOT OF 
MONEY BASIC TIPS ON HOW WE CAN ALL 
SAVE MONEY 
GOOD MORNING WE ALL 
HAVE GAS AND ELECTRICITY MAKE SURE 
YOU ARE ON THE BEST TARIFF THE WAY 
OF CHECKING THAT IS ON THE INTERNET 
WE ALL TEND TO JOIN THE GYM AND GO 
FOR A FEW TIMES AND NEVER GO AGAIN 
AND FORGET TO CANCEL THE DIRECT 
DEBIT IF YOU DO NOT GO COUNCIL 
EIGHT ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK IS 
A VERY GOOD IDEA IS TO ORGANISE A 
SMALL OVERDRAFT IF OCCASIONALLY 
AS WE ALL DO COME INTO THE RED 
USE IT IF YOU GO INTO THE RED 
THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE VERY HEAVILY

RAIN MOVING NORTH ACROSS THE 
SUNSHINE THE BEST SUNSHINE 
TOMORROW WILL PROBABLY BE IN 
SCOTLAND ELSEWHERE FEELING COLD 
JUST THINKING IS WITH ME THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OF SAINSBURY'S HE WILL 
SAY THE SUPERMARKET IS GOING TO CUT 
THE NUMBER OF BAGS BY HALF L. SAW 
YOU ON THE B. B. C. LAST NIGHT SAYING 
THE GOVERNMENT IS CHASING HEADLINES 
OVER PLASTIC BAGS WHAT DID YOU 
MEAN 
ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO THE MEAN RETAIL INDUSTRY TWENTY ONE RETAILERS GOT 
TOGETHER AND AGREED A REDUCTION 
TARGET OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
IMPACT OF BAGS BY THE END OF THE 
YEAR THE INDUSTRY HAVE RISK 
ACHIEVED A FOURTEEN PER CENT REDUCTION 
SAINSBURY'S HAVE ACHIEVED A FORTY PER CENT 
REDUCTION THEN OUT OF NOWHERE A 
TAX SHOULD BE INTRODUCED WE 
BELIEVE THE AGREEMENT SHOULD BE 
ALLOWED TO RUN ITS COURSE 
USE OF 
STREET THE GOVERNMENT HAS PRODUCED THIS 
POLICY ON TAX TO GET FAVOURABLE 
HEADLINES IN THE NEWSPAPER NOT 
BECAUSE THE POLICY WILL DO ANY 
GOOD 
IT IS NOT 
A POLICY YET IT IS GOOD A SUGGESTION THAT IF AS RETAILERS 
WE DON'T DO MORE IT WILL COME TO 
PASS THE TAX ON THE PLASTIC BAGS 
DOES NOT IMPROVE THE IMPACT ON THE 
ENVIRONMENT THE ALTERNATIVES 
PEOPLE USE ARE WORSE WE WANT TO 
PLAY OUR PART SO WE WILL SET A 
TARGET OF A FURTHER FIFTY PER CENT REDUCTION 
AND FOCUSED ON REDUCING USE 
RECYCLING WHEN WE CAN AND ENSURING 
REUSABLE BAGS OF THE ORDER OF THE 
DAY 
YOU ARE TRYING NOT TO SAY IT DAY BUT COME ON YOU THINK THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS CHANGED ITS POLICY 
ON PLASTIC BAGS AND IS GOING AFTER 
HEADLINES AND IT WILL HAVE AN 
IMPACT TO MAKE THINGS WORSE 
WE AS 
RETAILERS NEED TO SPEAK OUT AS WE 
ARE DOING BUT SHOW WE ARE TRYING TO 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE WE HAVE GIVEN 
AWAY FIFTEEN MILLION REUSABLE BAGS IN 
THE LAST YEAR THAT IS WHY WE HAVE 
ACHIEVED THAT REDUCTION THIS 
WEEKEND WE WILL ADDRESS WHY 
CUSTOMERS A FORGET TO BRING THOSE 
BAGS WITH THEM WE WILL GIVE ALL 
CUSTOMERS WHO FRIDGE MAGNET OR 
GREECE STICKER 
HAVE YOU TOLD 
MINISTERS YOU THINK THEIR POLICY IS 
WRONG 
YES AND THAT IS THE POINT WRONG MINISTERS WERE PRESENT IN THAT 
AGREEMENT SO THE INDUSTRY 
MINISTERS MOST UNUSUALLY WERE ALL 
AGREED ON THIS WHAT I HOPE WILL 
HAPPEN IF WE ALL REDUCE THE USE OF 
PLASTIC BAGS IN A YEAR'S TIME WE 
WILL SEE THE GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE 
THAT A TAX IS NOT NECESSARY WHAT WHAT HAVE YOU WHAT HAVE THEY SAID BACK 
TO YOU WHEN YOU HAVE TOLD THEM 
THEY ARE IN DANGER OF MAKING IT 
WORSE AND THEY ARE DOING IT FOR 
CHEAP PUBLICITY WHAT HAVE THEY 
SAID TO YOU 
THEY SAID PROVE US 
WRONG YOU ALONG WITH YOUR 
CUSTOMERS REDUCE PLASTIC BAG USED 
SO ATTACKS WON'T BE NECESSARY 
WE WILL BRING YOU THE LATEST 
INFORMATION ON THIS NEWS ABOUT 
CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES AND THE 
ALLEGATIONS THEY HAVE BEEN READING

THIRD OF THE SIZE OF TYPICAL 
HEDGEHOGS THEY WERE BRED IN

PET MARKET BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS 
HAPPY ABOUT IT THIS ONE IS ON AN 
EXERCISE REGIME THEY RUN ABOUT 
EIGHT MILES AND NIGHT BECAUSE THEY

NOVELTY VALUE IS DEFINITELY THERE 
FOR THESE CREATURES BUT THEY CAN 
BE INCREDIBLY FRIENDLY AND VERY 
TAME AS YOU CAN SEE IT IS 
IMPORTANT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THERE 
IS A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT THAT 
GOES INTO GET THEM THAT WAY AN AN ANIMAL WELFARE ORGANISATION SAYS IT

EXPERTS HAVE THE SKILLS NEEDED 
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT I I CAN TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS 
WITHOUT A DOUBT PEOPLE NEED TO 
REALISE THIS ISN'T A WILD HEDGEHOG 
IT IS VERY VERY DIFFERENT ANY 
BODY THAT WOULD TAKE AN ANIMAL OUT 
OF THE WILDE CLEARLY HASN'T GOT THE 
ANIMAL'S WELFARE IN MIND AT ALL IT IT IS IMPORTANT TO STRESS IT IS 
ILLEGAL TO TAKE A WILD HEDGEHOG AND 
KEEP IT AS A PET 
YES THESE ONES 
HAVE BEEN HANDLED BY MYSELF SINCE

VERY HAPPY BEING HANDLED THE 
HEDGEHOG SHOWS IT IS HAPPY BECAUSE

YOU THE HEAD OF U. K.'S BIGGEST EXAM 
BOARD IS WARNING THAT ACTION IS 
NEEDED TO PREVENT THE FAILURE OF 
THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW DIPLOMA SYSTEM 
JERRY JARVIS SAYS TEACHERS WON'T BE 
ADEQUATELY TRAINED BY THE TIME THE 
SCHEME IT LAUNCHED KEITH BREEN 
JOINS US H. WHAT HAS HE SAID HE HE SAID THIS QUALIFICATION RISKS 
FAILURE T. DIPLOMA IS BEING SWRO 
INTRODUCED IN SEPTEMBER IT IS A 
MIX OF PRACTICAL AND AM DEMOCRATIC 
QUALIFICATION TO PRE ACADEMIC 
QUALIFICATIONS THE GOVERNMENT 
HOPES IT WILL BECOME THE EXAM OF 
CHOICE MR. JARVIS SAYS TEACHERS ARE 
NOT BEING PROPERLY TRAINED SCHOOLS 
AREN'T SURE THOUSAND TEACH SOME 
ELEMENTS OF IT AND HE WORRIES 
BECAUSE IT A BROAD QUALIFICATION 
THAT PUPILS MAY LEAVE WITHOUT ANY 
QUALIFICATION THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
SAID TO SUGGEST IT IS IN DISARRAY 
IS UTTER NONSENSE IT SAYS ITS 
PLANS ARE ON TRACK 
THANK YOU THE 
OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING SAYS IT IS 
INVESTIGATING ONE HUNDRED TWELVE CONSTRUCTION 
FIRMS OVER ALLEGATIONS OF PRICE 
FIXING THEY SAID IT SUSPECTED THE 
COMPANIES RIGGED BIDS ON CONTRACTS 
FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR DECLAN CAN 
TELL US MORE 
IT HAS GONE FURTHER 
THAN AN INVESTIGATION THIS IS THE 
OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING ACCUSING 
THESE COMPANIES OF PRICE FIXING 
WHEN THEY APPLIED FOR WORK WITH 
COUNCILS THIS IS EVERYTHING FROM 
THE COST OF BUILDING SCHOOLS TO 
UNIVERSITIES TO HOSPITALS TO 
OTHER LOCAL COUNCIL BUILDINGS THEY 
ARE ACCUSED OF COVER PRICING YOU 
HAVE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES BIDDING 
FOR A CONTRACT THEY TALK TO EACH 
OTHER IN ADVANCE ABOUT WHO IS GOING 
BID HOW MUCH THEN ONE COMPANY BIDS 
VERY HIGH KNOWING THAT WILL ALLOW 
ALL THE OTHER COMPANIES TO RAISE 
THEIR PRICES AND CHARGE MORE THAN 
THE THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE DONE 
T. COMPANY KNOWS IT WOULD NOT GET 
THE FRONT BUT IT DIDN'T WANT THE 
WORK THAT IS HOW LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
END UP PAYING MORE FOR WORK THAN 
THEY SHOULD BE DOING AMONG THE ONE HUNDRED TWELVE 
COMPANIES ACCUSED OF THIS PRACTICE 
BY THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING SOME 
OF BIGGEST NAMES IN BUILDING 
INCLUDING BALFOUR BEATTY THE 
INVESTIGATION IS AFTER AN INITIAL 
COMPLAINT FROM THE WEST MIDLANDS 
THE OFT SAYS MORE THAN FORTY COMPANIES 
HAVE ALREADY ADMITTED GUILT THANK THANK YOU GORDON BROWN IS TO MEET 
PRESIDENT BUSH TO DISCUSS THE 
GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS THE PRIME 
MINISTER WILL ALSO HOLD PRIVATE 
MEETINGS WITH THE THREE MAIN 
CONTENDERS HOPING TO SUCCEED MR. 
BUSH THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS CLOSE 
TO AGREEING A PLAN TO EASE THE 
MORTGAGE FUNDING DROUGHT IT WILL 
ALLOW BANKS TO SWAP THEIR ASSETS 
FOR GOVERNMENT BONDS IT HOPED IT 
WILL ENCOURAGE BANKS TO LEND TO 
EACH OTHER POPE BENEDICT WILL 
CELEBRATE MASS IN WASHINGTON TODAY 
IN FRONT OF FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE LAST 
NIGHT THE POPE CRITICISED AMERICA'S 
CATHOLIC LEADERS FOR THEIR HANDLING 
OF THE CHILD SEX ABUSE SCANDALS 
THAT HAVE ROCKED THE CHURCH N. H. S. 
MANAGERS HAVE SUPPORTED PLANS TO 
CREATE G. P. SUPERSURGERIES BUT 
DOCTORS HAVE CRITICISED THE RUSH TO 
CREATE THE SO CALLED POLYCLINICS 
THE SURGERIES WILL HOUSE FAMILY 
DOCTORS ALONGSIDE OTHER SERVICES 
THIS IS THOUSAND GOVERNMENT SEES 
THE FUTURE OF HEALTH CARE A HEALTH 
CENTRE WITH A BIG GROUP OF G. P.'S AND 
SPECIALIST SERVICES LIKE THIS 
RETINA SCREENING FOR DIABETES 
PATIENTS MINISTERS WANT 
POLYCLINICS ACROSS ENGLAND TO GIVE 
PATIENTS MORE CARE IN ONE PLACE 
BUT IT IS A CONTROVERSIAL POLICY 
CRITICS SAY ONE CONSEQUENCE WOULD 
BE AN END TO SMALL SURGERIES WHERE 
PATIENTS SEE THE SAME G. P. BUT 
MANAGERS HAVE ENTERED THE DEBATE 
SAYING THE CLINICS COULD IMPROVE 
HEALTH CARE THEY SAY 
BUT THAT HAS NOT REASSURED THE 
SCEPTICS 
WE BELIEVE IT IS BETTER SCEPTICS TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF GENERAL 
PRACTICE AND ALLOW THEM TO EXPAND 
SERVICES TO IMPROVE THEIR SERVICES 
FOR PATIENTS THAT IS WHAT PATIENTS 
WANT TO SEE NOT AN IMPERSONAL 
CLINIC THAT MAY BE FURTHER FROM 
THEIR HOME 
BUT POLYCLINICS ARE 
CENTRAL TO GOVERNMENT HEALTH POLICY 
SO WE ARE LIKELY TO BE SEEING MANY 
MORE PLACES LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE 
TWO NEW STUDIES SUGGEST DRINKING 
SMOKING AND BAD DIET COULD SPEED UP 
THE ONSET OF ALZHEIMER'S THE 
FINDINGS SHOW PEOPLE HAVE MORE THAN 
TWO ALCOHOLIC DRINKS A DAY DID 
DEVELOP THE DISEASE FIVE YEARS 
EARLIER THAN THOSE WHO DON'T DRINK 
PEOPLE WITH HIGH COLL ERS TROLL 
LEVELS ARE ALSO MORE SUS C. E. M. 
SUSCEPTIBLE THE OLYMPIC TORCH HAS 
ARRIVED IN DELHI AHEAD OF THE 
BEIJING GAMES POLICE HAVE ARRESTED 
A NUMBER OF TIBETAN EXILES IT 
SEEMS LIKE AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM 
CARS THAT CAN RUN ON A FUEL THAT IS 
POLLUTION FREE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY 
FRIENDLY BUT SCIENTISTS ARE 
WORKING ON A PROJECT THAT COULD SEE 
IT BECOME A REALITY SARAH CAMPBELL 
CAN TELL US MORE YES WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT HYDROGEN FUELS THIS 
IS BRITAIN'S ONLY HYDROGEN FUELLING 
STATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
BIRMINGHAM IT OPENS TODAY BOB 
WILL GIVE A DEMONSTRATION OF HOW 
EASY IT IS TO FILL UP A CAR THE 
HYDROGEN GOES INTO THE CAR WHEN IT 
IS IN THE TANK IT MIXS WITH OXYGEN 
TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY AND THE ONLY 
BY PRODUCT IS WATER SO WHY AREN'T 
WE USING IT THERE IS AN ISSUE OF 
SAFETY HYDROGEN IS A VOLATILE GAS 
THE SECOND ISSUE IS WHERE DOES THE 
HYDROGEN COME FROM MUCH OF IT 
COMES FROM FOSSIL FUELS IN THIS 
CASE IT COMES ARE FROM RENEWABLE 
ENERGY THIRDLY THERE IS THE 
ACTUAL PHYSICAL COST ONE 
MANUFACTURER WILL RELIES A HYDROGEN 
CAR IN THE STATES THE ESTIMATES 
PRICE AROUND FIFTY THOUSAND THE 
RESEARCHERS ARE GOING TO SPEND TWO 
YEARS CHECKING THE EFFICIENCY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THEIR FLEET OF FIVE 
VEHICLES TO SEE WHETHER THIS IS 
VIABLE FOR THE MASS MARKET THANK 
YOU NOW YOU MAY GET BORED OF 
HEARING OUR VOICES EACH MORNING 
HERE IS A NEW ONE FOR YOU NOT 
HEARD FOR THIRTY THOUSAND YEARS RESEARCHERS RESEARCHERS IN AMERICA HAVE RE CREATED THE 
VOICE OF NEANDERTHAL MAN BY 
RECONSTRUCTING HIS VOCAL TRACTS 
LET'S HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY 
DIDN'T QUITE CATCH THAT E. 
THE E. THE THE SCIENTISTS ONLY HAVE THE SOUND 
OF HIM SAYING E. BUT THEY ARE 
PLANNING TO SIMULATE AN ENTIRE 
SENTENCE 
YES IN NEANDERTHAL THEY SENTENCE THEY SHOULD GET YOU TO DO IT 
THOSE ARE 
THE MAIN STORIES NOW WHY BALDING 
MEN ARE STRUGGLING TO COPE WITH 
LOSING THEIR HAIR AND THE CREDIT 
CRISIS AND FEARS OVER RISING 
MORTGAGE COSTS HAS LED TO THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND PLANNING INTERVENTION 
WE UNDERSTAND THE BANK WILL AGREE A 
PLAN TO ALLOW LENDERS TO SWAP THEIR 
MORTGAGE BACKED ASSETS FOR GOTH 
BONDS JOINING US GOVERNMENT 
BONDS GEORGE OSBORNE WILL JOIN US 
THIS IS YOUR IDEA 
WE HAVE BEEN 
PROPOSING IT WHAT THIS MEANS TO 
PEOPLE WATCHING IS THAT IT WOULD 
HELP WHEN THE BANKING CUTS RATES 
THESE ARE PASSED ON TO CUSTOMERS 
WITH THEIR MORTGAGE BILLS WHICH IS 
NOT HAPPENING AT THE MOMENTMENT WE 
SAW ONE BUILDING SOCIETY YESTERDAY 
RAISE THEIR RATES UNBLOCKING THE 
SYSTEM AND GETTING BANK OF ENGLAND 
TO DO THIS SWAP WHERE IT IS TAKING 
ON SOME MORTGAGES IN RETURN FOR THE 
EQUIVALENT OF CASH GOVERNMENT 
BONDS IS A GOOD IDEA BUT WE HAVE 
GOT TO MAKE SURE THE TAXPAYER IS 
PROTECTED 
THAT IS WHAT THE LIBERAL PROTECTED DEMOCRATS ARE WORRIED ABOUT VINCE 
CABLE SAID YOU CAN'T HAVE A 
SITUATION WHERE THE BANKS ARE BEING 
BAILED OUT 
WE ARE NOT BAILING OUT 
THE BANKS THERE SHOULD BE A 
TAXPAYER GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL 
GET THEIR MONEY BACK THERE ARE 
WAYS OF ENSURING THAT WHAT WE ARE 
TRYING TO DO IS HELP PEOPLE WHOA AT 
THE MOMENT CANNOT REMORTGAGE THERE 
ARE THOUSANDS FACING THE PROSPECT 
OF REAL HARDSHIP THEY CANNOT FIND 
MORTGAGE DEALS UNBLOCKING THE 
FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS AN IMPORTANT 
STEP AND IF THE GOVERNMENT COPS UP 
WITH A SENSIBLE COMES UP WITH A 
SENSIBLE IDEA I WOULD URGE THEM TO 
GET ON WITH IT THE GOVERNMENT 
COMES FORWARD WITH AN IDEA WE WILL 
SUPPORT IT 
YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MISHANDLING 
THIS CRISIS BUT HERE THEY ARE 
DOING T. R. RIGHT THING 
THEY HAVE NOT 
DONE IT YET WE HAVE A STORE YOU 
STORY WELL DONE B. B. C. WE HAVE BEEN 
CALLING FOR IT WE ARE OFFERING A 
CONSTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVE IF THE 
GOVERNMENT DOES THE RIGHT THING WE 
WILL SUPPORT THEM IF THEY DO NOT 
LIKE NATIONALISING NORTHERN ROSK 
WE WILL OPPOSE THEM WE HAVE MANY 
OTHER IDEAS WE WOULD LOVE THEM TO 
HELP FIRST TIME BUYERS ONE REASON 
THE HOUSING MARKET IS IN TROUBLE 
THERE ARE NO FIRST TIME BUYER THEY 
CAN'T AFFORD IT TAKING THEM OUT OF 
STAMP DUTY FIVE RAISING THE THRESHOLD 
AT WHICH YOU PAY STAMP DUTY WOULD 
HELP PEOPLE TRYING TO GET ENOUGH TO 
PUT DOWN A DEPOSIT ON A HOUSE AND 
MAY PAY THE MORTGAGE FEES 
IS THAT 
LONGER TERM PROBLEM 
THERE HAVE 
BEEN TWO PROBLEMS THE COST OF 
HOUSING HAS GONE UP BUT NOW IT IS 
COMING DOWN AND HOUSE PRICES ARE 
FALLING YOU WOULD THINK ONE GROUP 
WHO WILL BENEFIT ARE FIRST TIME 
BUYER BUT THEY FIND IT IS MORE 
DIFFICULT TO GET A MORT GAUGE 
MORTGAGE IF THE GOVERNMENT DO THAT 
FANTASTIC IF NOT YOU HAVE TO WAIT 
FOR A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT 
BECAUSE THERE IS A MARKET 
CORRECTION IN TERMS OF HOUSE PRICES 
AND BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD 
GOOD DEALS ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY 
GETTING MU NORTH GAUGE DOES THAT 
ADD UP TO FULL SCALE CRISIS YOU YOU ARE SEEING A PROBLEM WITH FALLING 
HOUSE PRICES YOU WANT HOUSE PRICES 
GROWING IN A MODERATE WAY YOU 
DON'T WANT THIS BOOM AND BUST 
WHERE THEY GO UP ONE YEAR AND FALL 
THE NEXT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD 
HAVE MORE OF AN EYE ON THE CREDIT 
CYCLE 
THEY HAVE NOT GONE UP ONE CYCLE YEAR AND DEPOUN THE NEXT THEY HAVE 
GONE UP STEADILY 
THEY FALLING AND 
MORTGAGE RATES ARE GOING UP THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND IS CUTTING RATES 
PEOPLE SEE THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS 
CUT RATES AND THEN THEY HEAR THEIR 
OWN BUILDING SOCIETY HAS PUT RATES 
UP THAT IS WHERE THE SYSTEM IS 
BROKEN YOU WANT WANT A MORE 
MODERATE GROWTH IN HOUSE PRICES 
YOU WANT TO HELP FIRST HFR TIME 
BUYERS AND HELP PEOPLE WITH THE 
RISING COST OF LIVING THE 
GOVERNMENT IS PUTTING TAXES ON WHEN 
IT SHOULD BE HELPING PEOPLE THANK THANK YOU 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME TODAY 
HAVE YOU BEEN DISCUSSING MOVING 
HOME HE'S NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO 
DO O. K. I'LL TELL HER BECAUSE 
WHY MEDIUMS AND CLAIRVOYANTS HAVE 
LOOKED INTO THEIR FUTURE THEY'RE

LOUISE DOES TO ME EVERY DAY AND IT

THE FUSS IS ABOUT YOU'RE GOING TO 
SEE SOME OF THE BEST WEATHER NOT 
ONLY TODAY BUT INTO TOMORROW AS 
WELL IN TERMS OF SUNSHINE 
THE FEEL OF THINGS TODAY ALONG THE 
NORTH SEA COAST IT WILL FEEL COLD 
ELSEWHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT HIGHS OF 
ELEVEN AND TEN DEGREES AND SHOWERS 
PUSHING INTO NORTH EAST ENGLAND 
PUSHING ACROSS THE PENNINES INTO 
SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
THROUGH THE NIGHT TO THE NORTH AND 
SOUTH QUIETER CONDITIONS 
RAIN AROUND FOR TOMORROW MORNING 
NOT A COLD NIGHT IT SHOULD BE 
FROST FREE TOMORROW WE'LL START 
OFF GREY AND WET WITH THIS WET 
WEATHER PUSHING UP FROM THE FAR 
SOUTH A LOT OF CLOUD GENERALLY 
ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES BEST OF 
THE SUNSHINE TOMORROW IN SCOTLAND 
AND WARMTH WITH ELEVEN DEGREES 
ELSEWHERE FEELING COLD WITH THE 
WINDS STRENGTHENING EIGHT OR NINE 
AT THE BEST 
THANKS THANKS IF YOU WERE TRYING TO BE FUNNY YOU 
COULD SAY THEY SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT 
COMING BUT SPIRITUALISTS AND 
CLAIRVOYANTS SAY NEW CONSUMER LAWS 
ARE NO LAUGHING MATTER THEY CLAIM 
THEY COULD BE SUED BY PEOPLE WHO 
ARE UNHAPPY WHEN THEY'RE TOLD 
SOMETHING THAT MAY TURN OUT TO BE 
WRONG AND GRAHAM SATCHELL IS 
LOOKING AT THIS FOR US THEY'RE 
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS 
THEY ARE AND 
WORRIED WORRIED BECAUSE IN THE 
PAST IF YOU FELT YOU HAD BEEN CONED 
BY A MEDIUM AND YOU WANTED TO TAKE 
THEM TO COURT YOU HAD TO SHOW THAT 
THEY WANTED TO DECEIVE YOU AND YOU 
WERE INTENTIONALLY DECEIVED THAT'S 
HARD TO PROVE UNDER THE NEW RULES 
ALL YOU HAVE TO SHOW IS THAT YOU 
WERE MISLED THAT IS MUCH EASIER TO 
SHOW THE SPIRITUALISTS HAVE BEEN 
LOOKING AT THIS LAW AND THEY'VE 
BEEN STARTING TO PANIC 
LOOKING AT THIS LAW AND THEY'VE BEEN STARTING TO PANIC 
WE'RE NOT HERE TO FORTUNE TELL 
WE'RE HERE TO BRING THROUGH LOVED 
ONES FROM WHAT I LIKE TO CALL 
HEFRPB 
A MEETING OF THE HEFRPB SPIRITUALIST HEART IN WIMBLEDON O. K. O. K. I HAVE A GENTLEMAN WITH A HEART 
CONDITION 
IVAN LEE A CLAIRVOYANT CONDITION CLAIMS TO BE GETTING MESSAGES FROM 
THIS WOMAN'S DEAD FATHER 
HAVE YOU 
BEEN DISCUSSING MOVING HOME YES YES HE'S NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO O. K. 
I'LL TELL HER 
THE SPIRITUALISTS 
ARE NERVOUS BECAUSE THEY TAKE 
DONATIONS THEY ARE ANTICIPATE 
CLASSED AS TRADERS AND COME UNDER A 
NEW CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW THEY 
SAY IT COULD LEAVE THEM OPEN TO 
LEGAL ACTION FROM DISGRUNTLED 
CUSTOMERS 
OUR MAIN CONCERN IS THAT CUSTOMERS ANYTHING WE SAY COULD BE 
MISCONSTRUED AND END UP WITH 
SOMEONE FEELING UNSATISFIED OR 
UNHAPPY AND AT THE END OF THE DAY 
TAKE LEGAL ACTION WE ARE A 
RELIGION WE'RE A WAY OF LIFE 
THE NEW LAW IS DUE TO COME INTO 
EFFECT NEXT MONTH IT WILL BEEF UP 
PROTECTION TO CONSUMERS IT WILL 
MEAN THAT ANY TRADERS INCLUDING 
PYSCHICS MEDIUMS AND CLAIRVOYANTS 
CAN BE PROSECUTED IF THEY MISLEAD 
THE AVERAGE CONSUMER 
GROUPS LIKE BAD PYSCHICS WHO 
EXAMINE THE CLAIMS OF MEDIUMS SAY 
THEY'RE ALL MISLEADING BECAUSE 
EVERYTHING THEY SAY IS UNPROFBL SO 
SHOULD THE SPIRITUALISTS START TO 
PANIC 
TRADING STANDARDS WHO WILL PANIC ENFORCE THE NEW RULES SAY PROBABLY 
NOT SO LONGS THE CLAIMS THEY MAKE 
ARE HONEST 
THE PEOPLE WE ARE WANT 
TO GO AFTER ARE THE ROGUES THE 
SCAM ARTISTS THEY'RE THE PEOPLE 
WE'LL LOOK OUT FOR SPIRITUALIST 
CHURCHES AND OTHERS THIS ISN'T 
DESIGNED TO ATTACK THEM OR GO AFTER 
THEM IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER 
PEOPLE WE'VE SPOKEN TO WHO VISIT 
PYSCHICS SAY MORE PROTECTION ISN'T 
REALLY NEEDED GRETA HAD NUMBER 
OF READINGS AFTER HER HUSBAND DIED 
FROM CANCER TRAGICALLY YOUNG I I THINK I WAS GOING HOPING SOMEBODY 
WOULD TELL MEAL EVERYTHING WOULD BE 
O. K. I KNEW THEY COULDN'T TELL ME 
THAT WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS 
GIVING ME SOME OPTIMISM FOR THE 
FUTURE 
DID YOU FEEL EXPLOITED NO FUTURE NO I DIDN'T L. CAME OUT FEELING QUITE OPTIMISTIC OPTIMISTIC I WENT IN KNOWING THAT WHAT THEY 
MIGHT SAY MIGHT BE TRUE MIGHT NOT 
BE TRUE 
NONETHELESS THE CLAIMS 
AND ADVERTS MADE BY PYSCHICS AND 
MEDIUMS WILL BE SCRUTINISED CLOSELY 
FOR MISLEADING STATEMENTS MANY ARE 
ALREADY PUTTING DISCLAIMERS IN THE 
SMALL PRINT SAYING WHAT THEY OFFER 
IS MAINLY ENTERTAINMENT 
GIVEN WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT 
ENTERTAINMENT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR 
SPIRITUALISTS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT 
GOING TO SAY IT'S ENTERTAINMENT 
IT'S TO THE FOR THEM 
NO THEY 
BELIEVE IT FOR THEM IT'S A 
RELIGION A WAY OF LIFE THAT'S 
WHAT'S UPSETTING THE MOST IT'S 
EASY FOR PYSCHICS TO SAY I'M GOING 
TO TELL YOU WILL WHAT WILL HAPPEN 
IN THE FUTURE BUT I CAN'T GUARANTEE 
IT SPIRITUALISTS ARE GOING TO 
DOWNING STREET TOMORROW THEY ARE A 
HANDING IN THIS PETITION AND 
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS LAW L. 
THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SAVING 
GRACES FOR THEM ONE IS WHO IS 
GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THEM THE 
PEOPLE WHO GO TO CHURCHES COMPLAIN 
SO THEY'LL NOT COMPLAIN L. L. THINK 
THE KEY THING IS TRADING STANDARDS 
ARE NOT AFTER THE SPIRITUALISTS 
THE SMALL TIME CHURCHES THEY'RE 
AFTER THE BIG TIME SCAMMERS WHO 
PREY ON THE VULNERABLE AND TRY TO 
DEMAND MONEY FROM THEM THESE ARE 
THE SORT OF THINGS THEY'RE AFTER 
THOUSANDS OF THESE LETTERS COME OUT 
CLAIMING TO BE FROM CLAIRVOYANTS 
SAYING ACT QUICKLY THERE'S A 
SILENT THREAT HANGING OVER YOU 
IT'S INTIMIDATION AND THEN THEY ASK 
FOR MONEY ALMOST UNBELIEVEABLY FORTY 
MILLION WAS MADE BY SCAMERS SENDING 
OUT THESE LETTERS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX LOSING LOSING YOUR HAIR CAN BE VERY TRAUMATIC 
BUT IS IT REALLY A DISABILITY AN 
EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL THIS WEEK 
REJECTED A CLAIM BY A FORMER 
TEACHER THAT HE HAD SUFFERED 
DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION AT THE 
SCHOOL HE TAUGHT AT BECAUSE HE WAS 
BALD GOING THIN ON TOP HAS NEVER 
HELD BACK SOME BRUCE WILLIS SEAN 
CONNERY BUT FOR MANY WHO ARE NOT 
CELEBRITIES APPARENTLY LOSING THEIR 
HAIR IS THE NUMBER ONE WORRY DAVID 
WATERS WORKS FOR MEN'S HEALTH 
MAGAZINE AND LIZZI HOSKING WORKS 
FOR COSMOPOLITAN 
AND WE BOTH HAVE FULL HEADS OF HAIR 
DAVID IT'S A TOP CONCERN FOR YOUR 
READERS 
ABSOLUTELY THINK FOR READERS MEN FOR YOUNG MEN AS WELL 
BALDNESS AFFECTS GUY IN THEIR EARLY 
TWENTIES EVEN WE DON'T WEAR HATS 
GENERALLY ANY MORE IT'S THERE 
YOU CAN'T AVOID IT BUT THERE ARE 
CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN DO TO 
IMPROVE YOUR LOOKS REALLY 
KEEP IT REALLY SHORT SHORT IT'S VERY SIMPLE 
WHAT THEY FOUND INTERESTINGLY HE 
WAS TRYING TO SAY IT WAS A 
DISABILITY DO YOUR READERS FEEL 
THAT BADLY ABOUT IT 
DEFINITELY AS 
YOU GROW UP YOU WANT TO FEEL 
CONFIDENT YOU WANT TO LOOK YOUR 
BEST OBVIOUSLY YOUR HAIR FOR 
WOMEN IT'S ALWAYS CALLED YOUR 
CROWNING GLORY MEN HAVE CROWNING 
GLORIES TOO I SUPPOSE IF IT'S 
THINING OUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT WHAT 
YOU WOULD PREFER TO HAVE LIZY LIZY BALD CAN BE BEAUTIFUL DEFINITELY DEFINITELY DEFINITELY DEFINITELY REALLY 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT IN REALLY THE OFFICE YESTERDAY AND LAUGHING 
ABOUT THIS TEACHER CASE L. DON'T 
THINK WE'VE EVER HAD A LETTER IN 
SAYING HELP HELP MY MANNED IS 
LOSING HIS HAIR I DON'T THINK 
WE'VE HAD A COMMENT THAT SOMEBODY 
IS SEXY BECAUSE OF HIS HAIR 
EVERYONE WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT 
THE MOST ATTRACTIVE THING IN ANY 
MAN IS CONFIDENCE IF IT'S SEVERELY 
AFFECTING YOUR CONFIDENCE THEN 
THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT IT BUT I 
DON'T THINK SPECIFICALLY LOEFPG 
YOUR HAIR IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD 
PUT WOMEN OFF 
I'M INTERESTED IN THAT IN THE FACT 
THAT IF SOMEBODY LOSES YOUR HAIR 
WHILE YOU'RE WITH THEM IS THAT 
DIFFERENT TO MEETING SOMEBODY IN A 
PUB OR SOMETHING WHO'S BALD I I SUPPOSE FOR WOMEN IT'S DIFFERENT 
MEN GO BY LOOKS ESPECIALLY IN THE 
FIRST STAGES OF A RELATIONSHIP OF 
COURSE IT CHANGES AFTER THAT FOR 
WOMEN IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S PROBABLY 
A SENSE OF HUMOUR AND CONFIDENCE 
THEY PROBABLY WEIGH THAT ABOVE 
PHYSICAL LOOKS 
I THINK IT'S GREAT 
THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT L. L. THINK A 
LOT OF THE CONCERN PARTICULARLY 
FOR YOUNGER MEN IS THAT WOMEN WILL 
FIND THEM LESS ATTRACTIVE IF WOMEN 
ARE SAYING IT'S ABOUT HAVING A 
PERSONALITY AND BEING FUN AND 
INTERESTING AND INTELLIGENT THEN 
THAT'S BRILLIANT GUYS RELAX 
I HAVE DREAMS SOMETIMES THAT I'VE 
GONE COMPLETELY BALD 
THAT HAS TO 
MEAN SOMETHING 
IT WON'T HAPPEN 
BECAUSE AT YOUR AGE YOU WOULD HAVE 
LOST IT BY NOW 
IS THAT RIGHT ABSOLUTELY 
WHEN I ABSOLUTELY WAS YOUNGER IT USED TO BE A 
NIGHTMARE AND NOW IT'S JUST A DREAM 
STKPWHRM WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE DO IF 
THEY ARE GOING BALD 
MY ADVICE 
WOULD BE TO GO WITH IT 
TO SHAVE IT 
OFF 
AT COSMOPOLITAN OUR TYPE OF OFF THING IS ALWAYS BE THE BEST YOU CAN 
BE BE SOMETIMES YOUR HAIR COVERS SHAPE 
THAT ISN'T PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE 
THAT'S TRUE IF YOU HAVE NEAT 
ROUND SHAPED HEAD HAVING SHORT HAIR 
WILL LOOK NEAT IF YOU HAVE A BIG 
BOXY SQUARE SHAPED HEAD IT MIGHT 
NOT BE LOOK SO GOOD THERE ARE 
TREATMENTS ON THE MARKET WHICH HAVE 
PARTIAL SUCCESS THEY TEND TO STOP 
YOU LOSING MORE HAIR 
POLISH OR NOT 
POLISH 
NOT POLISH SUN CREAM POLISH IT'S TRENDY IS IT TRENDY TO NOT 
HAVE HAIR 
I THINK IT IS 
BUT THEN AGAIN IT'S ALL PART OF A 
WHOLE PACKAGE NOT JUST 
LOADS OF 
FOOTBALLERS SHAVE THEIR HEADS LOOK LOOK AT BECKHAM HE'S KEPT HIS HAIR 
REALLY SHORT IT LOOKS GREAT

LOOK AT ONE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER WHO 
REALLY DO NOT SEE EYE TO EYE HOW HOW EASY IT AT SCHOOL DARLING 
I AM 
NOT AT SCHOOL ANYMORE 
AREN'T YOU 
I'M AT SIXTH FORM COLLEGE SIXTH SIXTH FORM COLLEGE IS THAT A DIFFERENT 
PLACE 
DIFFERENT PART OF THE PLACE BUILDING DIFFERENT PART OF THE BUILDING BUILDING THIS PROJECT YOU LOVE 
DOING DARLING 
MUM DO NOT GET 
INVOLVED 
SWEETIE I 
AM INVOLVED L. INVOLVED AM YOUR MOTHER L. WANT TO KNOW IT IT IS EIGHT D. N. A. PROJECT WE PRESENT 
NEXT WEEK AS PART OF OUR TAM WORK 
A PER DAY 
OPEN DAY WHAT DAY 
DARLING 
NOT COMING L. AM THAT IS DARLING I AM THAT IS WHAT I SAY TO MY KIDS SOMETIMES 
THEY SHRINK IN TERROR OUT ON THE 
TOWN EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT GETTING 
DOWN THE LAGERS 
KNOW L. THINK IT 
IS VERY HARD TO BE YOUR DAUGHTER'S 
BEST FRIEND L. AM VERY CLOSE TO 
HAVE AND I TELL HER THINGS THAT 
FOR EXAMPLE I WOULD NEVER HAVE 
DISCUSSED WITH MY MOTHER MY MOTHER 
NEVER TALKED ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT 
WITH ANOTHER LIVING SOUL YOU HAVE 
TO BE A MENTOR AND GAY PRIDE YOU 
CANNOT NECESSARILY BE YOUR BEST 
FRIEND OF YOUR DAUGHTER YOUR 
GUIDE I WOULD LIKE NO CRITICISM TO 
BE MADE OF FREDDIE THE THING THAT 
THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF YORK HAVE 
DONE IS TO BRING UP TWO GIRLS IN HE 
MIDDLE OF THIS DIVORCE YOU CAN BE 
GREAT PARENTS EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE 
SEPARATE I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE SAID 
THEY GO OUT TOGETHER ONE OF THEM 
IS ON A GAP YEAR L. THINK LINDSAY 
LOHAN HAS BEEN OUT DRINKING WITH 
HER MOTHER HASN'T SHE SHE HAS 
BEEN IN TROUBLE WITH DRINK HAS 
SHE YOU HAVE GOT TO STEP BACK 
WHEN DOES THAT MOMENT COME WHEN 
THEY ARE LITTLE AND YOU ARE WITH 
THEM ALL THE TIME AND YOU HAVE TO 
STEP BACK AND LET THEM GO ACTUALLY 
NOT GO WITH THEM 
THEY ASKED TO GO 
I REMEMBER WHEN CLAUDIA WAS GOING 
TO GO IN THE SIXTH FORM AND SHE SAID 
YOU HAVE GOT TO GIVE ME MORE 
PERSONAL SPACE L. SAID I AM DOING 
THE BEST I CAN OF COURSE YOU WANT 
TO GO WITH THEM ALL THE TIME WHEN 
THEY LEAVE TO GET MARRIED YOU WANT 
TO TUCK THEM UP IN BED EVERY NIGHT 
YOU HAVE GOT TO SAY WHEN THEY ARE 
EIGHTEEN BUT YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE 
GOING AND WHO THEY ARE GOING WITH 
BUT YOU CANNOT GO WITH THEM WE ARE 
GOING TO BE BAFTAS TOGETHER ON 
SUNDAY THAT TAKES MOST OF THE YEAR 
SERIOUSLY YES YOU SHOULD GO OUT 
FROM TIME TO TIME 
PRESUMABLY YOUR 
ARGUMENT IS THAT A MOTHER HAS TO 
KEEP SOME DISTANCE IN ORDER THAT AT 
SOME TIME SHE MAY HAVE TO EXERCISE 
SOME SORT OF AUTHORITY 
YOU HAVE TO 
THE OTHER THING IS THEY NEED BEST 
FRIENDS OF THEIR OWN AGE THEY NEED 
BEST FRIENDS WHO ARE GOING TO FALL 
IN N. A. V. AT THE SAME TIME AND GET 
MARRIED AT THE SAME TIME AND BE 
THEIR BEST FRIENDS LOVE YOU 
CANNOT BE THAT YOU ARE TWENTY OR THIRTY 
YEARS OLDER

COMMON SHE UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT IS 
ABOUT 
IT ABOUT OLDER WOMEN ABOUT TRYING TO STAY YANG WE ARE 
DESPERATELY TRYING

PHANTOM PHANTOM OF THE OPERA IN 
CANADA AND I KNEW HE COULD SING SO 
THAT IS HOW I KNEW IT WOULD COME 
ABOUT 
ANDREA BOCELLI COMES IN ABOUT SWEEPING IN FROM THE WINGS AFTER AFTER WE DID A TIME TO SAY GOODBYE AND 
THAT BECAME A BIG HIT ALL OVER THE 
WORLD WE DIDN'T WANT TO RECORD 
ANYTHING AFTER THAT BECAUSE YOU 
COULD NOT BEAT IT THIS IS THE 
FIRST SONG WE HAVE RECORDED SINCE 
THEN 
YOU 
MENTIONED DARKER AND YOU THEN MENTIONED GOTHIC AND YOUR IMAGE 
SEEMS MUCH DARKER IS THAT A CHANGE 
FOR YOU A CONSCIOUS THING 
I WAS 
QUITE GOTHIC AS A CHILD I HAD PALE 
SKIN AND I LOVED WEARING BLACK AND 
I WAS INTO HORROR STORIES IT IS 
PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT OF MY SOUL IN 
THERE 
THE IMAGERY HERE IS OF A THERE ROMANTIC PRINCESS ALMOST TRAPPED 
IN A CAVERN IT IS A GREAT SOUND 
WAS IT THREE YEARS WAS THAT HOW 
LONG IT TOOK 
I MADE IT OUT TOUGH 
OVER FIVE YEARS L. HAVE DONE SO 
MANY TOURS OVER THE YEARS AND I DID 
NOT WANT TO REPEAT MYSELF 
HOW DID 
YOU GET THE CONTINUITY BECAUSE YOU 
DID IT IN SIX DIFFERENT RECORDING 
STUDIOS ON THREE DIFFERENT 
CONTINENTS 
I WAS ALSO RELEASING CONTINENTS CHARITY CONCERTS AROUND THE WORLD 
IT HAD TO FOLLOW ME AND THAT IS WHY 
WE ENDED UP IN SO MANY STUDIOS IT 
IS GOOD BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A 
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT DIFFERENT 
IDEAS 
DIFFERENT PRODUCERS 
NO I IDEAS HAVE WORKED WITH THE SAME PRODUCERS 
IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE WHAT WOULD BE 
YOUR FAVOURITE TRACK 
IT IS A SONG 
WHICH IS BEAUTIFUL IT IS A 
CONTEMPORARY CLASSICAL PIECE OF 
MUSIC 
YOU HAVE ALSO DONE A PLAN MUSIC WAY YOU HAVE TAKEN CLASSICAL THEMES 
AND THEN VOCALISED THEM YES YES SOMEBODY HAD TO WRITE WORDS FOR 
THOSE 
WHICH I DID WITH A GERMAN THOSE LYRICIST WHICH WAS GREAT FUN L. 
HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED CLASSICAL MUSIC 
AND SYMPHONY WORK AS WELL USUALLY 
I HAVE LOVED INSTRUMENTAL CLASSICAL 
WORKS THERE ARE MANY BEAUTIFUL 
PIECES OUT THERE WHICH SOUND LIKE 
TUNES OR PIECES OF MUSIC WHICH 
PEOPLE CAN SING TOO THAT IS WHY I 
TENDED TO PUT VOCALS WITH THESE 
PIECES SOMETIMES IT WORKS 
SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T 
DID YOU HAVE 
TO DISCARD SOME THINGS THAT YOU 
RECORDED 
I AM CONTINUALLY RECORDED RECORDING AND A LOT OF THINGS WERE 
DISCARDED NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE BAD 
BUT IT ISN'T THEIR TIME YEARS 
LATER YOU FIND OUT THAT THEY FIT 
WITH WHAT I AM DOING NOW SO YOU 
RE RECORDED AND THAT IS HOW THEY 
GENERALLY COME OUT AT SOME POINT OR 
OTHER 
YOU HAVE A MIX OF CLASSICAL OTHER AND POP MUSIC IS THAT A DIFFICULT 
MIX OR WAS IT NATURAL 
BECAUSE I 
HAD A LONG TIME TO MAKE THE 
SYMPHONY ALBUM IT WASN'T DIFFICULT 
BECAUSE I HAD TIME TO DO THAT L. 
HAVE HAD A THIRTY YEAR LONG CAREER 
SINCE MY FIRST HIT L. HAVE WORKED 
IN SO MANY DIFFERENT STYLES IT 
SEEMS NATURAL TO HAVE THAT ECLECTIC 
MIX OF STYLES IN THERE 
I CANNOT 
BELIEVE IT IS THIRTY YEARS 
I FEEL OLD 
WHAT WAS IT 
I LOST MY HEART TO A 
START SHIP TROUPER 
THERE YOU ARE 
IT IS THE SAME DARK SETTING NOT 
THE SORT OF GOTHIC IMAGE AND NOW 
IT WAS THE END OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES DISCO 
ERA WHICH WAS GOOD FUN 
I PRESUME 
THIS ISN'T IN YOUR REPERTOIRE ANY 
MORE 
I DID A GAY PRIDE CONCERT IN MORE THE PARK A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND 
EVERYBODY LOVED IT AND IT WORKED 
YOU WERE PART OF THE ORIGINAL PAN'S 
PEOPLE 
NOT THE ORIGINAL I WORKED PEOPLE WITH BARBARA AND EVERYBODY FOR ME 
AT THAT AGE I WAS JUST SEVENTEEN AND IT 
WAS A DREAM COME TRUE BECAUSE I HAD 
BEEN WATCHING THEM FOR ALL THOSE 
YEARS BEFORE WHEN I GOT IN I 
COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WAS HAPPENING 
TO ME IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THAT 
ENJOYMENTS OF ENJOYING SUCCESS AND 
DOING ALL THOSE THINGS YOU ENJOY AS 
A YOUNGSTER AND WANT TO GET ON IS IS THERE A FAULT OF SARAH BRIGHTMAN 
RECORDINGS WHICH WE CAN DIG INTO AT 
SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE 
IT IS 
SITTING IN A HARD DRIVE SOMEWHERE 
AS I SAID RECORDING FOR ME IS 
ONGOING BECAUSE I LOVE DOING IT AND 
I LOVE EXPERIMENTING WITH THINGS I 
LOVE PRODUCING AND WRITING L. 
COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH THERE IS 
ARE YOU GOING ON TOUR 
I AM GOING 
ON WORLD TOUR STARTING IN MEXICO 
IN NOVEMBER GOING THROUGH THE 
UNITED STATES AND CANADA USUALLY USUALLY PEOPLE COME ON AND SAY I AM 
STARTING IN WINDSOR WORTHING AND 
SKEGNESS SKEGNESS THEY ARE DEFINITELY NOT CUDDLY BUT 
THEY ARE CUTE THEY ARE THE LATEST 
MUST HAVE PET READERS CANNOT KEEP 
UP WITH DEMAND 
WHAT ARE THEY 
GOOD MORNING THESE ARE THE AFRICAN 
PYGMY HEDGEHOGS AROUND A THIRD OF 
THE SIZE OF NORMAL HEDGEHOGS THEY 
WERE BRED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
CAPTIVITY IN AMERICA AROUND TEN 
YEARS AGO THEY HAVE BEEN 
INTRODUCED TO THE U. K. PEP MARKET 
BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS HAPPY ABOUT 
THAT PET MARKET HOW CAN THEY 
MAKE GOOD PETS 
TAKE A LOOK AT THEM 
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE AS 
LONG AS THEY ARE POP PROPERLY 
SOCIALISE THEY ARE VERY HAPPY 
VERY FRIENDLY AND ABSOLUTELY 
GORGEOUS 
THE R. S. P. C. A. FEARS ONLY GORGEOUS EXPERTS CAN GIVE THEM THE ATTENTION 
THEY NEED AN ANIMAL WELFARE 
CHARITY IS APPALLED AT THE IDEA OF 
THESE BEING KEPT AS PETS WHAT IS 
YOUR REACTION 
I CAN UNDERSTAND 
THEIR CONCERNS BUT THERE IS A HUGE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE LITTLE 
CREATURES AND WHILE HEDGEHOGS 
TAKING A WILD HEDGEHOG AND KEEPING 
IT AS A PET IS ILLEGAL UNLESS IT 
IS FOR RESCUE PURPOSES AND THESE 
ARE A DOMESTIC PET 
WHILE HEDGEHOGS 
IT IS ILLEGAL TO TAKE THOSE THIS 
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THEY ARE 
ALL PEDIGREE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN 
CERTIFICATES 
THESE ONES DO THERE CERTIFICATES ARE LOT BUT DON'T AS A BREEDER I 
MAKE SURE I HAVE AT LEAST FOUR 
GENERATIONS WITH ALL MY HEDGEHOGS 
SO I AM NOT INTERBREEDING RELATED 
HEDGEHOGS THEY ARE ALSO REGISTERED 
WITH THE U. K. AFRICAN PYGMY HEDGEHOG 
REGISTRY THIS MEANS WE CAN KEEP AN 
EYE ON BLOODLINES AND GENETIC 
ISSUES ISSUES SOME PEOPLE MIGHT ARGUE THEY 
SHOULDN'T BE KEPT AS PETS WHAT 
EVERYONE WILL AGREE TO LOOK AT 
THEM ON A CUTE 
ARE THEY PRICKLY
