AND KEANO STUPID DOG 
HAS PUSHED HIS OWNER TO THE EDGE 
I DON'T LIKE HIM AND I DON'T LOVE HIM 
THE OWNERS OF THESE BAD DOGS HAVE HAD ENOUGH 
IT'S TIME FOR EXTREME MEASURES 
THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE SALOON FOR BAD DOGS 
SET UP ON A SECURED TEN ACRE COMPOUND 
IN A REMOTE PART OF THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
DOG BORSTAL IS RUN BY THREE OF BRITAIN'S TOUGHEST TRAINERS 
I'VE NEVER MET A DOG I CAN'T TRAIN 
EACH TRAINER WILL TAKE ON ONE DOG 
AND ATTEMPT TO REFORM THEIR BAD BEHAVIOUR 
USING THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL TRAINING METHODS 
MY MISSION IS TO TEACH OWNERS TO TEACH DOGS WHO'S BOSS 
BUT TO TACKLE BAD DOGS THEY NEED TO TAKE ON THEIR OWNERS 
I MAY BE THE ONLY FEMALE HERE BUT I'M NO PUSHOVER 
THESE DOGS HAVE BEEN SENTENCED TO DO TIME AT DOG BORSTAL 
BUT WILL ALL OF THEM COMPLETE THEIR SENTENCE 
MEET THE FELLS 
THEY LOVE ANIMALS 
THEY KEEP A HORSE TWO PARROTS A TANK OF FISH 
A COLLECTION OF SNAILS A GIANT RABBIT 
AND A JACK RUSSELL CALLED MAX 
THEY WERE A NOISY BUT HARMONIOUS BUNCH 
UNTIL THE FELLS DECIDED TO ADOPT 
MEET MITCHELL 
IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS HE'S TURNED THEIR LIVES UPSIDE DOWN 
IN AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE OVER THE HOUSEHOLD 
STARTING AT THE TOP 
RICHARD IS THE DOG'S TOY 
AS YOU CAN SEE HE DECIDES TO BE LIKE THIS 
IN THIS FAMILY MITCHELL BULLIES ME 
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS BUT HE SEEMS TO MAUL ME 
STAY DOWN 
HE CUT MY LIP OPEN 
HE ACTUALLY HAD MY HEAD IN HIS JAWS 
I FELT HIM PUSHING AND PRESSURISING MY HEAD 
THEY SEEM TO THINK IT COULD BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH DOMINANCE 
I JUST THINK HE LOVES ME BUT HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO SHOW IT PROPERLY 
IN HIS BID TO RULE THE ROOST 
MITCHELL HAS MADE JACK RUSSELL MAX HIS PARTNER IN CRIME 
BEFORE WE GOT MITCHELL MAX WAS A QUIET DOG 
HE SEEMS TO SPRING TO LIFE WITH MITCHELL 
IT IS MORNING NOON AND NIGHT EVERY SINGLE DAY 
IT CONSTANTLY GOES ON LIKE THIS UNTIL THEY'RE TIRED REALLY 
THEN THEY WILL HAVE A FIVE MINUTE REST AND START AGAIN 
THEIR RAUCOUS BEHAVIOUR IS OUT OF CONTROL 
WHEN YOU PLAY WITH MITCHELL HE JUST GRABS YOUR ARM 
AND SOMETIMES HE TRIES TO PICK YOU UP BY THE HEAD 
AND THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN MITCHELL INDOORS 
IS MITCHELL OUTDOORS 
THE PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH HIM IS THAT WHEN WE TAKE HIM OUT 
HE JUST RUNS AT EVERYBODY AND IT'S SCARING PEOPLE ROUND HERE 
MITCHELL 
COME HERE 
HE HAS JUST BEEN HIT AND KICKED BY ANOTHER DOG WALKER 
MITCHELL THAT WAY 
CAN YOU BRING HIS LEAD I CAN'T RUN IN THESE 
MITCHELL HAS TURNED THE FELLS INTO SOCIAL OUTCASTS 
WE CAN'T KEEP GOING BECAUSE IT IS GETTING RIDICULOUS 
WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN GO OUT AS A FAMILY AND TAKE YOUR DOGS WITH YOU 
BECAUSE THE DOG IS SO DISRUPTIVE AROUND PEOPLE 
IT IS THE END OF THE ROAD FOR MITCHELL 
AND WHEREVER HE GOES SIDEKICK MAX FOLLOWS 
BUT THIS TIME IT'S STRAIGHT TO DOG BORSTAL 
THEY WILL BOTH BE UNDER THE STRICT CONTROL OF TRAINER LYNNE DAVIES 
LYNNE IS RENOWNED FOR ACHIEVING RESULTS WITH CATEGORY A OFFENDERS 
I HAD A LOOK THROUGH THE NOTES AT THIS SOME FIGHTING GOING ON 
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE A DOMINANCE ISSUE 
BUT I THINK MY JOB IS GOING TO BE WITH GETTING THE PEOPLE WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD 
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR DOMINANCE IS ABOVE THE DOGS' 
AND AS LONG AS THEY CAN GET THEIRS ABOVE THE DOGS' ANYTHING ELSE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL 
BUT MITCHELL AND MAX ARE NOT GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT 
STOPPED OFF AT THE SERVICE STATION 
AND THE DOG SET OFF AT ABOUT SIXTY MILES AN HOUR WITH ME 
I ONLY HAD MY TRAINERS AND HE DRAGGED ME STRAIGHT INTO A BUSH 
HE GAVE ME A BLACK EYE 
BUT RESISTANCE IS FUTILE 
HI NICE TO MEET YOU I'M LYNNE 
IF YOU WANT TO GRAB YOUR DOGS OUT WE CAN GO IN AND REGISTER 
TRAINING AT BORSTAL IS PHYSICALLY DEMANDING 
SO BEFORE BEING BANGED UP MITCHELL AND MAX MUST FIRST PASS A MEDICAL 
RIGHT STICK HIM UP 
I HEAR THEY HAVE BEEN UP TO MISCHIEF ALREADY HAVE THEY 
HE IS VERY WELL BEHAVED IN HERE 
IT'S THE BLACK ONE MODEL PATIENT 
I AM QUITE HAPPY WITH HIM HE LOOKS ABSOLUTELY FINE GOOD 
THAT IS THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM 
RIGHT 
SO YOU'RE THE PROBLEM CHILD ARE YOU 
MAYBE 
HOLD HIS MOUTH SHUT FOR ME 
SO THAT I CAN HAVE A BIT OF A LISTEN 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING MITCHELL 
WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN THE DOOR 
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE A HANDFUL BUT HE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN VERY GOOD 
NEXT STOP THE KENNEL BLOCK 
O. K. WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THEM HERE 
WHEN YOU COME OUT IF YOU JUST HOOK THEIR LEADS ON HERE 
I THINK THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE REALLY HARD 
MITCHELL AND MAX NEED CONTROL IN THEIR LIVES 
WHAT WE HAVE GOT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT RICHARD AND KAREN FIRST OF ALL GET CONTROL OF MITCHELL 
HE IS THE MOST DOMINANT GET CONTROL OF HIM AND WORK OUR WAY DOWN 
WE'RE HERE NOW WE WILL PUT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT IN 
BECAUSE THERE IS NO POINT COMING IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT 
WHILE MITCHELL AND MAX MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME 
THEIR OWNERS SETTLE IN TO THEIR ARMY ISSUE TENT 
I WENT CAMPING LAST WEEKEND AT THE BIG HORSE SHOW 
AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE TO PUT THE TENT UP THIS TIME 
BORSTAL LIFE IS STRICT AND DISCIPLINED 
WORDS THAT MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO THE NEXT INMATE TO ARRIVE 
TAZ PLEASE DARLING LIE DOWN YOU'RE GETTING ALL STRESSED OUT 
I AM A BIT NERVOUS 
BACK HOME IN STAFFORDSHIRE TAZ LIVES A LIFE OF LUXURY 
COURTESY OF HIS DOTING OWNER FAYE 
I'M A SOFT TOUCH WHEN IT COMES TO TAZ 
HE HAS GOT A LOT OF SPECIAL DOGGIE BLANKETS 
C'MON BABY 
AND DOGGIE BOWLS AND EVERY TIME WE GO SHOPPING HE ALWAYS GETS A TREAT 
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY AREN'T YOU 
BUT FAYE'S PAMPERING HAS TURNED TAZ INTO A BIG HEADED CANINE BRUTE 
TAZ TAZ BEHAVES LIKE HE IS KING OF THE HILL 
LET GO 
WHEN HE IS STRUTTING HIS STUFF NO ONE IS GOING TO STOP HIM 
STOP PULLING 
IT IS A NIGHTMARE IT REALLY IS A NIGHTMARE I STRUGGLE TO HOLD HIM 
TAZ STOP IT 
HE WILL PULL ME HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE 
AND TAZ DOESN'T LIKE ANYTHING CRAMPING HIS STYLE 
TAZ STOP IT 
IF ANOTHER DOG COMES HE WILL TURN REALLY NASTY AND HAVE A GO 
THERE IS NOTHING ENJOYABLE ABOUT THIS WE'RE IN THE LOVELY COUNTRYSIDE 
AND I'M JUST BEING PULLED AROUND AND I CAN'T ENJOY MYSELF 
TAZ HAS ONLY TWO REAL LOVES IN LIFE FOOTBALL 
AND TAKEAWAYS 
THE OTHER NIGHT WE HAD CURRIED DUCK AND FRIED RICE AND HE ENJOYED IT 
HE LIKES TO GO TO MCDONALDS AND HAVE A QUARTER POUNDER WITH CHEESE 
AND A MCFLURRY HE LOVES CHOCOLATE 
ICE CREAM 
TAZ KNOWS THAT IF HE COMES UP TO ME AND GIVES ME THAT LITTLE 
I AM SO HARD DONE TO LOOK AT HOW BEAUTIFUL I AM LOOK 
THEN I WILL GIVE HIM WHATEVER I HAVE GOT 
BUT THIS FAT FUELLED DIET HAS TURNED TAZ INTO THE JIM ROYLE OF THE DOG WORLD 
HE BURPS CONSTANTLY AND HIS FARTS ARE TERRIBLE 
HAS HE GUFFED 
HE IS A TYPICAL BLOKE AND HIS MAIN OBJECTS IN LIFE ARE TO EAT 
HAVE WIND AND SLEEP 
I THINK IF A DAY IS FILLED WITH ALL OF THAT HE WILL BE VERY HAPPY 
THIS CANINE COUCH POTATO HAS VEGGED OUT LONG ENOUGH 
IT IS TIME FOR DRASTIC ACTION 
I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE MIC IF I HAD THE CHOICE 
MIC IS QUITE SCARY 
AND I'M A LONG WAY FROM HOME HERE 
AND ON MY OWN WITH THE DOG AND A TINY BIT VULNERABLE 
TAZ COULDN'T HAVE A HARSHER SENTENCE 
A WEEK WITH MIC MARTIN CAN SEEM LIKE A LIFETIME IN DOG YEARS 
IF YOU DO LOTS OF EXERCISE WITH STAFFIES THEY CAN BE FANTASTIC FANTASTIC PETS 
BUT MIC'S STRICT TRAINING METHODS ARE NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED 
I REALLY LIKE STAFFIES 
ARE WE NEARLY THERE 
I REMEMBER ALL THE GOOD THINGS COME FROM STAFFORDSHIRE 
I WAS BORN IN STAFFORDSHIRE 
OH GOD 
I'VE GOT HIM HAVEN'T I 
HELLO THERE HI 
JUST WAIT THERE JUST WAIT THERE 
WHO ARE YOU FAYE HARPER HELLO I AM MIC I AM YOUR DOG TRAINER 
JUST GET YOUR DOG OUT PLEASE HELLO BABY 
GOOD BOY 
YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT IN THERE DID YOU 
WHY NOT HE'S NEVER BEEN IN A CAGE BEFORE 
OH RIGHT O. K. HAS HE BEEN IN KENNELS BEFORE 
NO NEVER NO 
HE HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE VETS OR ANYTHING 
NO 
HE'LL ENJOY IT IT'S NICE 
NICE IS PROBABLY NOT WHAT SPOILT TAZ IS THINKING 
DOG IN LET'S GO FOR IT 
THE BEST THING IS TO PUT HIM IN TAKE THE LEAD OFF 
CLOSE THE DOOR BEHIND YOU 
JUST TAKE IT OFF AND COME STRAIGHT OUT 
THE TROUBLE WITH THIS DOG IS THAT HE IS BORED 
SHE HAS MADE IT LAZY 
IT IS GOING TO TAKE ME ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO FIX THE DOG 
BUT IT'LL PROBABLY TAKE ME FIVE DAYS TO FIX HER 
DISCIPLINARIAN MIC IS EAGER TO OUTLINE HIS TRAINING REGIME 
YOU CARRY THE RUCKSACK AT ALL TIMES 
UNLESS INSTRUCTED OTHERWISE BY ME ALL THE TIME 
YOU GO TO THE TOILET AND YOU CARRY YOUR BAG 
YOU GO TO DINNER YOU CARRY YOUR BAG WALKS CARRY YOUR BAG 
GROOM YOUR DOG EVERY MORNING 
SO TOMORROW MORNING EVERYONE ELSE WILL BE HAVING BREAKFAST BUT YOU WILL BE GROOMING YOUR DOG 
CARRY BAGS ALL THE TIME AND ALWAYS PICK UP AFTER YOUR DOG 
FAILURE TO DO SO MEANS YOU WILL RECEIVE A PUNISHMENT 
ARE YOU HAPPY YEAH GOOD 
SHE IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO A LONG WAY TO PROVE TO ME THAT SHE HAS GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO FINISH THIS COURSE 
WITH MIC'S MANUAL OF RULES AND PLENTY OF HOMEWORK TO KEEP HER BUSY 
TAZ'S OWNER CAN UNPACK THE ESSENTIALS FOR A WEEK'S DOG TRAINING 
IT IS JUST A BIT WEIRD TO BE GREETED BY MIC LOOKING SO STERN AND SO MEAN 
IF HE GOT MORE OF A FRIENDLY FACE IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO BAD 
IT IS GOING TO BE REALLY WEIRD HAVING TAZ IN THE KENNELS TONIGHT 
I'M GONNA TRY TO BREAK HIM OUT 
NOT REALLY I'M TOO SCARED OF MIC 
THE FINAL CANINE OFFENDER IS ARRIVING AT DOG BORSTAL 
MEET WIDGET ADORED BY OWNER PIPPA 
YOU ARE SO CUTE 
AND BORDER TERRIER KEANO ADORED BY OWNER ADAM HE IS CUTE 
YOU CAN FIT HIM IN ONE HAND 
CUTE STILL CUTE NOW 
BUT HERE IS WHERE THE HARMONY ENDS 
PIPPA HAS BEEN KEEPING A CHARGE SHEET OF KEANO'S CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOURS 
HE WAS REALLY CUTE FOR PROBABLY ABOUT THE FIRST FOUR OR FIVE DAYS 
AND THEN WE PROPERLY INTRODUCED WIDGET BECAUSE WIDGET IS SIX YEARS OLDER 
THAT IS WHEN ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE HE DECIDED THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE THE BOSS 
HE BULLIES WIDGET 
HE DESTROYS THINGS WHEN YOU'RE NOT LOOKING 
HE DID A POO ON THE BED RIPPED THE SOFA CUSHIONS TO PIECES 
HURT MY FRIEND WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT 
HE DOES NOT COME BACK HE RUNS OFF 
KEANO HAS AN IMPRESSIVE TALLY OF OFFENCES INDOORS AND OUT 
KEANO KEANO HE HAS SCREAMING FITS AT OTHER DOGS 
HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND NO AND HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND STOP 
I KNOW HOW REWARDING DOGS ARE 
AND HE JUST ISN'T 
THIS GRISLY HOUND IS DRIVING A WEDGE BETWEEN HIS OWNERS 
I DON'T ALWAYS SEE THE PROBLEMS THAT HE HAS 
CRAP DOG PIECE OF 
THAT STUPID DOG 
AM I RIGHT THOUGH 
OR SHOULD I BE MORE TOLERANT 
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU SHOULD BE MORE TOLERANT 
I DON'T LIKE HIM I DON'T LOVE HIM 
KEANO STOP IT 
WE HAVE ARGUMENTS BECAUSE THAT IS MY DOG AND THAT IS HIS DOG 
AND THE ONLY REASON I HAVE WRITTEN INTO DOG BORSTAL IS TO WIND HIM UP 
BECAUSE THAT PIECE OF PISSED ME OFF 
BUT THEY DO AGREE ABOUT ONE THING PIPPA'S PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN 
AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR KEANO 
THE MAIN REASON YOU GET AN ANIMAL IS BECAUSE YOU ENJOY THEIR COMPANY 
YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE THEM TO YOUR FRIENDS 
YOU WANT TO BE PROUD OF THEM 
AND I DON'T FEEL ANY OF THOSE THINGS ABOUT HIM AT ALL 
KEANO HAS ONE LAST SHOT A WEEK IN DOG BORSTAL TO SHAPE UP OR SHIP OUT 
THEIR TRAINER WILL BE ROBERT ALLEYNE 
HE SPECIALISES IN DOG BEHAVIOUR 
HELPING OWNERS UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES THEIR DOGS TICK ARE YOU READY FOR THIS KEANO 
NO ONE BETTER UNDERSTANDS THE NATURE OF THE BEAST 
BORDER TERRIERS BRED FOR HUNTING OTHER ANIMALS 
SO WHEN YOU TAKE THEM INTO ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THERE ARE SQUIRRELS OR RABBITS 
THE DOG WILL BE GONE 
THEY ARE BRED TO GO THAT WAY NOT THIS WAY SO RECALL IS GENERALLY POOR WITH THEM 
UNLESS YOU TEACH THEM OTHERWISE 
THIS IS A DOG THAT WAS NEVER GONNA FIT INTO THAT 
THE ENTIRE FAMILY HAVE ACCOMPANIED KEANO TO BORSTAL 
BUT WIDGET HAS HAD A TROUBLED JOURNEY 
SHE HAS GOT A COUGH AT THE MOMENT 
A COUGH COULD BE A POTENTIAL PROBLEM 
AND RESTRICT WIDGET'S ABILITY TO TAKE PART IN ANY ACTIVITIES 
SHE HAD A BIT OF A SNORT THERE 
BUT I CAN'T HEAR ANY HARSHNESS AND HER CHEST SOUNDS CLEAR 
SOMETIMES AFTER THEY HAVE HAD THE VACCINE THEY CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A COUGH 
IT IS LIKE A SMOKER'S COUGH 
I WOULD NOT NECESSARILY PANIC ABOUT IT RIGHT AT THE MOMENT 
BUT I THINK WE BETTER KEEP AN EYE ON HER OVER THE NEXT DAY OR TWO 
YOU'RE LOOKING A BIT WORRIED I AM BECAUSE THE GOOD DOG IS ILL 
WE WILL GET THE VET TO CHECK HER AGAIN IN THE MORNING 
BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY'VE STILL GOT ANOTHER DOG TO DEAL WITH 
AND THAT DOG I THINK IS THE PROBLEM 
SO THAT MEANS PIPPA WILL BE WORKING KEANO THIS WEEK WHICH IS NO BAD THING 
AT BORSTAL OWNERS MUST OBEY A STRICT TIMETABLE 
DOGS ARE FED AT SIX KENNELS MUST BE KEPT CLEAN AT ALL TIMES 
AND BEFORE LIGHTS OUT DOGS MUST BE WALKED AND TAKEN TO THE TOILET 
HAVE YOU GOT POO BAGS ON YOU 
POO BAGS ON YOU NO 
YOU SHOULD HAVE POO BAGS ON YOU 
I CAN SEE IT IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE WEEKS 
JUST COME DOWN ONE AT A TIME 
TAZ'S OWNER FAYE IS LAST OUT 
I JUST WANTED TO ENJOY IT 
AND I THINK IF HE IS PUTTING EXTRA PRESSURE ON YOU 
COME HERE 
SAKE 
WE WILL BE ALL RIGHT NOW WON'T WE KID HAS ANYONE GOT ANY TISSUES 
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
SHE CRIES AT THE DROP OF A HAT 
ARE YOU UPSET WHY 
THIS CAN BE HARD AT THE END OF THE DAY 
AND YOU HAVE GOT TO GET YOURSELF MENTALLY PREPARED TO CARRY ON 
YOU'RE DOING IT FOR A REASON 
THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU WILL GET THE RESULT THAT YOU HAVE COME HERE FOR 
IF YOU LISTEN TO ME AND HAVE A BIT OF FAITH 
WHILE TAZ SETTLES IN FOR A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP HIS OWNER GETS TO GRIPS WITH HER HOMEWORK 
I HAVE GOT TO READ A COUPLE OF CHAPTERS 
I FORGOT WHICH ONES HE SAID 
TWO AND THREE I THINK HE SAID 
IT IS BLOODY COLD AND WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO THIS QUILT AND GO TO SLEEP 
REALLY PEACEFUL BUT ALMOST A BIT SCARY OUT THERE 
FREEZING I AM REALLY COLD AND I WISH TAZ WAS HERE TO KEEP ME WARM 
BUT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO TOMORROW WE'LL GIVE IT A GOOD GO 
MITCHELL AND MAX KEANO AND TAZ ARE IN FOR A TOUGH WEEK 
MITCHELL AND MAX ARE IN BORSTAL FOR ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR 
BUT CAN TRAINER LYNNE BRING THEM TO HEEL 
KEANO'S NASTY TEMPERAMENT IS DRIVING HIS FAMILY APART 
I'LL MAKE HER LIKE YOUR DOG 
AND COUCH POTATO TAZ WON'T BE GIVING UP THE GOOD LIFE WITHOUT A FIGHT 
I THOUGHT YOU LET ME DOWN 
BUT THIS TIME 
NOT ALL OF THEM WILL MAKE IT THROUGH A WEEK AT DOG BORSTAL 
THE DAY STARTS EARLY AND RUNS TO A STRICT TIMETABLE 
DOG IN 
MORNING 
BUT SOME INMATES FIND THE REGIME MORE DIFFICULT THAN OTHERS 
THE DOGS HAVE TO BE WALKED AT SEVEN A M. SHARP 
BUT MITCHELL AND MAX'S OWNERS ARE RUNNING LATE 
AND KENNEL MANAGER DAVE IS NOT IMPRESSED 
STOP THE KNOCKING 
BECAUSE THE KNOCKING IS JUST PISSING ME OFF IT IS WINDING THEM UP 
HE'S A MISERABLE 
THINGS QUICKLY GO FROM BAD TO WORSE 
TAZ IS FIRST OUT ON THE TRAINING FIELD 
MIC SUSPECTS HIS PROBLEMS MAY BE DIET RELATED 
AND STARTS WITH A FEW PROBING QUESTIONS 
WHAT TIMES DO YOU FEED 
WE FEED HIM IN THE MORNING WE GIVE HIM HALF A TIN OF FOOD 
AND IN THE AFTERNOONS HE'LL HAVE THE HALF TIN OF FOOD WITH BISCUITS 
ANYTHING ELSE IN THE EVENING 
HE'LL HAVE A CHEW OR A TREAT 
WHAT WOULD HE HAVE TO DO TO DESERVE A TREAT NOTHING 
NOTHING NO YOU JUST GIVE IT TO HIM YES 
JUST FOR BEING TAZ JUST FOR BEING MY BABY 
FOR MIC DOG TRAINING IS ABOUT DISCIPLINE NOT INDULGENCE 
DOGS NEED TO LEARN TO EARN 
YES THEY DO A LITTLE JOB 
THEY COME BACK WHEN YOU CALL THEM THEY DO A SIT THEY DO A DOWN 
THEY WALK ON THE LEAD WITHOUT PULLING 
AND THEIR WAGES IS THEIR FOOD 
FAYE CHOOSES NOT TO MENTION THE OTHER THINGS TAZ LIKES TO EAT 
ONE HUNDRED QUESTIONS LATER AND MIC'S READY TO OBSERVE HOW FAYE HANDLES TAZ 
IT'S A MASSIVE PICTURE 
THERE'S LOADS TO DO 
YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO TAKE HIM ONTO THE ROAD AND DROP IT AND GO THE OTHER WAY 
TAZ TRY TO STAY ON THE ROAD WITHOUT HIM PULLING YOU OVER TO THE GRASS 
MIC SUGGESTS THAT THE CURE FOR TAZ'S PULLING MIGHT BE ALONG THE LEAD 
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS MAKE A LEAD LIKE THAT 
AND HOLD IT NICE AND SHORT LIKE THIS SO AS YOU'RE WALKING ALONG 
YOU'RE GOING TO DROP IT AND YOU'RE GOING TO GO BACK THE OTHER WAY 
GETS IN FRONT DROP IT AND GO THE OTHER WAY 
THE RESULTS ARE AMAZINGLY QUICK 
AS SOON AS YOU DROP IT 
HE STOPS PULLING YES 
IN THE ALL TIME WORLD RECORD I BELIEVE TWO SECONDS 
LET'S DO IT WITHOUT THE LEAD 
LET'S JUST WALK LIKE THIS 
LITTLE BIT MORE 
AND IT'S ALL DOWN TO THAT PIECE OF THING YOU CALL A LEAD 
NOW IT'S FAYE'S TURN DROP IT GO THE OTHER WAY 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE BITS OF CHEESE CLICKERS AND ANY OF THAT OLD 
YOU JUST TURN ROUND AND GO THE OTHER WAY AND IT'S NOT CRUEL BECAUSE THE DOG HAD A BIG THICK COLLAR ON 
YOU DO IT ONCE AND THAT'S IT 
NOW THAT'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PLEASE 
MIC'S FIXED TAZ'S PULLING ON THE LEAD PROBLEM 
BUT IT'S NOT OVER YET 
IT'S JUST WORKED REALLY WELL I'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT MIC SAID AND WE JUST FINISHED WITH TAZ 
JUST WALKING REALLY GENTLY BY MY SIDE AND IT'S BEEN ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL WELL DONE MATE 
A VERY GOOD SESSION THERE 
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT SO KEEP THAT UP AND EVERYONE'LL BE HAPPY 
NEXT OUT ARE MITCHELL AND MAX 
AND FOR OWNER RICHARD EVEN WALKING TO THE TRAINING FIELD IS A CHALLENGE 
THEME TO ROOBARB 
FIRST LYNNE WANTS TO TACKLE MITCHELL 
AT HOME HIS PLAY FIGHTS HAVE STARTED TO LEAD TO CUTS AND BRUISES 
HE LOVES ME BUT HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO SHOW IT PROPERLY 
FROM NOW ON PLAY SHOULD ONLY BE A REWARD FOR GOOD BEHAVIOUR 
AND ALL FOUR PAWS MUST STAY ON THE GROUND AT ALL TIMES THIS IS FINE 
HE CAN DO THIS AS MUCH AS HE LIKES 
SO THIS REPLACES ANY KIND OF PLAY FIGHTING THAT YOU EVER DO WITH HIM 
RICHARD STARTS TO GET THE HANG OF IT 
LET GO MITCH LET GO 
BUT FINDS STOPPING PLAYING MORE OF A CHALLENGE 
NO 
NO 
YOU'RE GETTING FRUSTRATED 
TAKE YOUR TIME LET GO HIS TIMING IS AWFUL 
AND HIS INTERACTION WITH THE DOG IS AWFUL 
I THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST THE WAY THAT HE ACTS WITH THE DOG THAT'S WHAT HE'S LEARNT TO DO DOWN 
SO IT'S GOING TO BE MORE ABOUT BREAKING HIS BAD HABITS 
O. K. RUN BACKWARDS FETCH IT 
FETCH IT MAX GET IT 
SO LYNNE TURNS TO KAREN 
HOPING THAT SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CALM MITCHELL DOWN 
BUT EVEN SHE CAN'T MAKE MITCHELL RESPOND TO THE MOST BASIC OF COMMANDS 
DOWN 
DOWN THESE ARE JUST BASIC THINGS THAT REALLY DOGS SHOULD KNOW 
BUT RICHARD AND KAREN REMAIN OPTIMISTIC 
MITCHELL 
I THINK IT WENT WELL I THINK THE STUFF SHE WERE TELLING US WERE RIGHT 
YOU CAN SEE THE METHOD IN WHAT SHE'S SAYING 
MITCH 
I THINK HE'S A SOFT TOUCH AND I THINK SHE IS AS WELL 
IT THINK SHE'S REALLY SOFT ON THE DOGS THAT'S FINE 
I'M SOFT ON MY DOGS BUT DOGS NEED TO REALISE WHERE THEIR PLACE IS 
WIDGET'S COUGH HASN'T IMPROVED 
SO THE VET WANTS HER TO STAY IN THE KENNEL FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK 
BUT IT GIVES ROBERT THE PERFECT CHANCE TO CONFRONT HIS BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
GETTING PIPPA TO BOND WITH HER PARTNER'S DOG KEANO 
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH ANYONE WHO WAS AS OPENLY HOSTILE ABOUT THEIR DOG AS PIPPA IS 
CRAP DOG A PIECE OF THAT STUPID DOG 
MUCH AS SHE MAY NOT LIKE IT PIPPA WILL BE WORKING KEANO 
BECAUSE SHE HAS A TERRIBLE ATTITUDE TOWARDS HIM 
AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT 
ROBERT WANTS TO START BY SEEING JUST HOW KEANO AND PIPPA INTERACT 
IMAGINE YOU'RE IN A BUSY STREET LOTS OF PEOPLE 
SO YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM OUT 
HE'S OUT ON HIS OWN THEY JUST SORT OF HOLD ON TO THE END OF THE LEAD 
AND THERE'S NO COMMUNICATION GOING FROM THE DOG TO THE OWNER 
ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IS INTERACT WITH HIM MORE WHEN YOU'RE WALKING HIM 
FOCUS ON KEEPING HIS ATTENTION ON YOU SO YOU CAN TALK TO HIM 
START TO EDUCATE HIM ON WHERE YOU'RE HAPPY FOR HIM TO BE 
AND YOU WANT YOU EVERY SEVEN OR EIGHT PACES TO STOP AND GIVE HIM A TREAT 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HE'S DOING AND HE WILL START TO WALK ALONG LOOKING UP HERE 
BECAUSE HE SEEMS TO BE GETTING WELL PAID 
EVERY TIME HE JUMPS UP JUST TELL HIM TO GET DOWN 
DOWN 
RIGHT STOP AND GIVE HIM ONE 
HERE YOU GO 
REMEMBER TO USE THAT VOICE KEEP HIS ATTENTION FOCUSED ON YOU 
GOOD THAT'S BETTER 
I'M GOING TO MAKE HER LIKE YOUR DOG 
AND HAVING GOT KEANO'S ATTENTION SHE NEEDS TO KEEP IT 
HAVING GIVEN HIM A TREAT ENCOURAGE HIM TO CONTINUE TO PAY ATTENTION 
OTHERWISE ALL THAT YOU WILL FIND THAT WILL HAPPEN IS HE'LL GO THANKS NOW WHERE WAS I 
SO MUCH BETTER AND PIPPA IS LIKE I CAN DO THIS WHICH IS WHAT HE NEEDS REALLY 
GOOD BOY 
YOU SEE YOU THINK I'VE GOT THIS MANIC PULLER AND AS YOU SEE 
HE'S REALLY NOT THAT BAD HE JUST NEEDED THAT BIT MORE EDUCATION YES 
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET IT IF YOU GET IT RIGHT 
PIPPA IS LEARNING TO CONTROL KEANO 
BUT SHE STILL DOESN'T LIKE HIM 
WE NEED TO BOND BECAUSE WE HAVE NO BONDING GOING ON AT THE MOMENT 
OTHER THAN HE'S CUTE WHEN HE'S POOPED 
WHICH ISN'T A GOOD BASIS FOR A RELATIONSHIP IS IT 
WE ARE A FAMILY 
IT'S NOT YOUR DOG OR MY DOG 
YEAH AND WE NEED TO SORT IT OUT 
LUNCH GIVES THE DOGS TIME TO REST 
AND THE OWNERS A CHANCE TO DIGEST WHAT THEY'VE LEARNT 
NICE TO HAVE OUR DINNER WITHOUT HAVING A DOG HOWLING ITS HEAD OFF 
I'M REALLY MISSING TAZ 
AT HOME TAZ GETS WHAT HE WANTS 
NO IS NOT A WORD HE HEARS 
TAZ KNOWS THAT IF HE COMES UP TO ME AND GIVES ME THAT LITTLE LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL I AM LOOK 
THEN HE KNOWS I'LL JUST GIVE HIM WHATEVER I'VE GOT 
FROM NOW ON EVERY TIME HE MISBEHAVES HE'LL HEAR ONE WORD 
NO 
NO 
BUT TIMING IS CRUCIAL 
USE THE COMMAND AT THE WRONG MOMENT 
AND TAZ WON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S BEING TOLD OFF FOR 
GOOD BOY 
TIMING'S GOT TO BE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THREE TWO ONE DROP IT 
SAY THE WORDS NO NO 
WALK PAST KEEP GOING 
GOOD BOY 
BRILLIANT HANDLER'S SHOWING REALLY GOOD CONTROL AND EXCELLENT TIMING 
TIMING IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT AND SHE'S GOT IT 
VERY PLEASED WITH THAT 
MITCHELL HAS NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO COME BACK WHEN CALLED 
SO LYNNE IS TEACHING HIS OWNERS HOW TO USE A TOY AS AN INCENTIVE TO RETURN 
JUST SAY IT ONCE MITCHELL HERE 
WHAT'S THIS 
JUST GO AND STAND OVER THERE WITH YOUR BACK TO HIM 
WHEN HE COMES OVER PLAY WITH HIM EXCITEDLY GET YOUR TOY OUT 
WHAT'S THIS TUG O. WAR 
HERE IGNORE HIM IF HE WALKS AWAY JUST FACE THE OTHER WAY 
NEXT UP IT'S KAREN WHAT'S THIS HERE 
AFTER A WHOLE AFTERNOON OF PRACTISING LYNNE REALISES 
WITH NEITHER OWNER ABLE TO MASTER A SIMPLE RECALL TECHNIQUE 
THE SITUATION IS MUCH WORSE THAN SHE HAD INITIALLY THOUGHT 
WELL WE'VE GOT VIRTUALLY NO RECALL WITH THIS DOG 
AND THAT'S WITH EITHER KAREN OR RICHARD 
WE'D LET HIM OFF IN THE PARK AND HE DOES SEE ANOTHER DOG OR SEE SOME KIDS PLAYING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
AND HE HEADS IN THEIR DIRECTION 
THEY CAN SHOUT AND SCREAM AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE AND HE'S NOT GONNA STOP 
LYNNE LAYS IT ON THE LINE YOU TWO ARE RESPONSIBLE ADULTS 
SO IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP CONTROL OF THIS DOG 
AND MY ADVICE IS HE DOESN'T HAVE FREE RUNNING IN THE PARK ANY MORE 
UNTIL YOU'VE WORKED ON A RECALL 
IF HE HARMS SOMEBODY OR SOMEBODY IS SCARED OF BEING HARMED BY HIM 
HE WILL BE FOUND GUILTY UNDER THE DANGEROUS DOGS ACT O. K. 
IF HE'S FOUND GUILTY THEY WILL DESTROY HIM 
LYNNE IS STARTING TO HAVE SERIOUS DOUBTS OVER THIS CASE 
BUT MITCHELL'S OWNERS DON'T SHARE ALL HER CONCERNS 
THEY'RE NOT VICIOUS DOGS THEY'RE NOT KILLER DOGS 
DANGEROUS ANIMALS ACT OUR TWO DUCKS THAT WE HAD COULD HAVE BEEN CLASSED AS THAT 
OUR DUCKS BIT YES THEY DID 
OUR RABBIT BITES IF IT'S PUSHED 
ANY ANIMAL IS DANGEROUS IF IT'S NOT HANDLED PROPERLY OR LOOKED AFTER OR RESPECTED YES 
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY OF TRAINING AND BEFORE THEY EAT THE OWNERS HAVE TO SEE TO THEIR DOGS 
FOR THE FIRST TIME FAYE FEELS LIKE SHE'S GETTING SOMEWHERE 
MIC'S REALLY IMPRESSED WITH US WITH US BOTH ME AND TAZ 
NOT HAD ANY PUNISHMENTS DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT 
IT'S JUST GONE REALLY WELL 
HARD MAN MIC IS PLEASED WITH THEIR PROGRESS 
BUT BEFORE HE UPS THE PACE HE WANTS TO SCRUTINISE THEIR DAILY ROUTINE 
IT MAKES FOR VERY INTERESTING VIEWING 
HE LIKES TO GO TO THE DRIVE THROUGH AT MCDONALD'S AND HAVE A QUARTER POUNDER WITH CHEESE 
AND A MCFLURRY 
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT THE TAKEAWAY FOOD STUFF 
THE BIG MACS THE CAKES THE CHOCOLATES 
YOU KNOW ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION AND ALL I WANT IS AN ANSWER 
I ASKED HER TO WRITE IT DOWN SHE DIDN'T 
WHAT AM I A DETECTIVE 
FAYE IS ABOUT TO LEARN ONE OF MIC'S CARDINAL RULES 
FAYE 
YEAH I NEED TO SEE YOU BACK AT YOUR TENT 
TELL THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH 
OR FACE THE CONSEQUENCES 
IT SAYS QUITE CLEARLY ON THERE THAT YOU GIVE IT MCDONALD'S 
BURGERS AND CAKES AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER 
NOT THAT OFTEN BUT YOU SAID THAT YES 
I SAID TO YOU QUITE CLEARLY SO YOU DON'T FEED IT ANYTHING ELSE 
AND YOU SAID NO 
SORRY I WAS JUST CONCENTRATING ON THE DAILY ROUTINE NO BUT ANYTHING 
YEAH ANYTHING THAT YOU FEED ONCE WE'VE GONE TO MCDONALD'S 
AND HE'S HAD A BURGER THAT WE HAVEN'T EATEN BUT ONCE 
WE DON'T TAKE HIM THERE ESPECIALLY 
I DON'T KNOW YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW HOW MASSIVE A DEAL IT IS BUT I THINK THE DIET IS MASSIVE HERE 
SO FOR THAT REASON I'M CONFISCATING YOUR ALCOHOL 
I FELT YOU LET ME DOWN 
ALL RIGHT THEN 
I WAS JUST REALLY PLEASED THEN 
I WAS YOU KNOW REALLY HAPPY 
AND NEVER MIND 
JUST RUINED IT ALL 
I'VE HAD SUCH A GOOD DAY WITH TAZ 
I JUST WANT TO GO AND GET TAZ AND OFF 
IF I FEEL LIKE THIS AGAIN TOMORROW I'M JUST GOING TO GO 
THEY'LL HAVE TO TAKE ME HOME IT'S BEEN A HARD DAY 
BUT THE OWNERS HAVE ONE LAST TASK 
THE LONG WALK AND AS ALWAYS MIC SUPERVISES THE INMATES 
SHE'S MAKING A FEW MISTAKES THERE NOW 
SHE'S STILL LETTING IT PULL TOWARDS CORNERS 
WE'RE WATCHING YOUR MAN HERE 
I STILL DON'T KNOW HIS NAME 
HINGE HINGE AND BRACKETT 
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE DOG'S NAME ACTUALLY MITCHELL 
MITCHELL YES IT'S A GOOD NAME FOR A DOG 
MIGHT AS WELL CALL IT HERPES COS THAT DOESN'T HEAL EITHER 
DELTA ONE TO SECURITY OVER 
YEAH WE'VE LOCKED DOWN NOW AND KENNELS ALL LOCKED THANK YOU 
CANINE OFFENDERS MITCHELL MAX KEANO AND TAZ ARE ALL SERVING TIME AT BORSTAL FOR BAD BEHAVIOUR 
IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY MUST PASS A TEST TO PROVE THEY ARE REFORMED 
BUT THEY HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO THIS ISN'T GOING TO PLAN 
AND THIS TIME AT LEAST ONE DOG ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT 
AND WILL BE LEAVING BORSTAL IN DISGRACE 
IT MIGHT BE AN EARLY START 
BUT MITCHELL IS ALREADY UP TO HIS OLD TRICKS 
RICHARD AND KAREN THINK THEY'RE MAKING PROGRESS 
YES I THINK IT IS GETTING BETTER 
I WOULD HAVE BEEN ACROSS THIS FIELD AT THREE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR BEFORE 
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING TAZ NOW I'M REALLY EXCITED 
HE'S GONNA GO MAD WHEN HE SEES ME 
FAYE MAY BE GETTING A WARM RECEPTION FROM TAZ 
BUT SHE'S STILL GOT TO WIN OVER MIC 
DO I ENJOY MAKING HER CRY SHE WAS CRYING BEFORE SHE CAME HERE 
SHE WAS CRYING TEN MINUTES BEFORE I MET HER SO I DIDN'T MAKE HER CRY 
IT'S YESTERDAY WHO GIVES A NOW TODAY LET'S GO ON FROM IT 
PART OF MIC'S MASTER PLAN TO TRANSFORM COUCH POTATO TAZ 
IS TO TEACH FAYE THERE IS MORE TO KEEPING A DOG THAN A FIVE MINUTE WALK 
WHAT HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF AT ALL THE WAY I SEE IS STIMULATION MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY 
SHE NEEDS TO PUT AS MUCH EFFORT INTO EXERCISING HIM AS SHE DID INTO SPOILING HIM 
JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE MORE FUN WITH YOUR PET 
BUT IN A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE WAY 
GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY TOO EASY LET'S DO THOSE 
UP GOOD BOY 
UP GOOD BOY UP 
VERY PLEASED WITH FAYE WHEN SHE DOES HER TRAINING 
YOU CAN'T FAULT HER REALLY HER TIMING'S GOOD SHE'S KEEN 
WHEN SHE'S INTERACTING WITH HER DOG 
IT'S ALL THAT OTHER AT THE CAMP 
NO SERIOUSLY GOING TO GO HOME LAST NIGHT 
BUT TODAY IS GOING REALLY WELL SO 
TAZ IS LOVING IT HE'S A SHOW JUMPING HORSE 
IT'S A GOOD JOB HE KEPT THOSE TWO ROSES 
BECAUSE IF I'D DRUNK THEM BOTH I'D BE IN A RIGHT STATE THIS MORNING 
DOG IN 
COME ON KID 
OVER ON LYNNE'S FIELD IT'S BACK TO BASICS 
THEY DON'T SEEM TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S THEIR PROBLEM 
THEY THINK IT'S THE DOG'S IT'S NOT IT'S THEM 
TRAINER LYNNE WANTS TO SHOW THEM THAT IN THE RIGHT HANDS THEIR DOG IS CONTROLLABLE 
SIT 
SIT GOOD LAD 
WE'LL DO THAT THEN SHALL WE 
SO THERE'S NO CONFUSION LYNNE SHOWS RICHARD EXACTLY WHAT SHE MEANS 
SO LEAD IN THE RIGHT HAND ON THE SAFE LEAD 
LEFT HAND DOWN THE LEAD MAKING A LOOP 
PULL AGAIN FOR ME 
O. K. AND ALL I'VE DONE IS DROP THAT LOOP AND GO THE OTHER WAY BUT KEEP MY HANDS THERE 
BUT CAN THEY CONTROL MITCHELL WHEN HE'S ON THE LEAD 
O. K. NOW 
O. K. MAKE YOUR LOOP AGAIN TELL HIM HE'S A GOOD BOY WHEN HE'S NEXT TO YOU 
O. K. NOW 
NOW 
BETTER AND NOW 
NOW HE'S CURED ALREADY SHE'S CURED HIM 
RICHARD AND KAREN ARE FINALLY MAKING PROGRESS 
GOOD LAD BUT WITHIN MINUTES THEY'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE 
HE GOT ME IN THE EYE AGAIN ALL RIGHT YES 
THE OWNERS ARE VERY NAIVE IN THAT YOU KNOW 
THEY DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE IT COMING 
AND WHEN THEY WERE HAVING A GO AT EACH OTHER 
THEY WERE LAUGHING ABOUT IT DO YOU WANT TO GO AND GET SOME WATER 
TO ME THAT DEFINITELY WASN'T PLAY THAT WAS TWO DOGS TRYING TO REALLY HAVE A GO AT EACH OTHER 
STOP IT I THINK THEY REALISE THAT THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE 
I DON'T THINK THEY REALISE HOW BAD IT IS 
WITH THE TEST IN SIGHT ROBERT'S CONCERNED THAT THERE'S PROGRESS BUT NO LOVE 
JUST REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME 
TO GET PIPPA TO START TO LIKE THIS DOG AND I THINK ONE OF THE WAYS 
TO DO THAT IS TO MAKE HER START TO APPRECIATE THAT HE IS ABLE 
IN FACT THE ONLY REASON THIS DOG HAS FAILED THUS FAR 
IS BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO EDUCATE HIM NOT BECAUSE HE'S JUST A BAD DOG 
ROBERT THINKS THE KEY TO GETTING PIPPA CLOSER TO KEANO IS TO GIVE HER MORE CONTROL OVER HIM 
KEANO STOP IT 
AT HOME KEANO IGNORED HIS OWNERS 
NOW BY USING A RATTLE BOTTLE TO REINFORCE THE LEAVE COMMAND 
THEY SHOULD FINALLY HAVE SOME SUCCESS 
LEAVE REPEAT THE COMMAND 
LEAVE AND AGAIN DO IT AGAIN 
LEAVE 
KEANO QUICKLY GETS THE MESSAGE AND SOON PIPPA DOESN'T EVEN NEED THE BOTTLE 
LEAVE LEAVE 
OH WHAT A GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY OH IT'S REALLY CRUEL BUT IT'S REALLY COOL CRUEL AND COOL 
KEANO SEEMS TO LIKE PIPPA'S DISCIPLINED APPROACH 
BUT ADAM'S GETTING NOWHERE 
O. K. ADAM 
KEANO KEANO KEANO 
KEANO KEANO 
KEANO 
HE IS ADDING DEAF 
SELECTIVE HEARING KEANO 
GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
YOU CAN HAVE THE DOG 
I FEEL QUITE TEARY ACTUALLY 
I THINK I'VE JUST HAD AN EPIPHANY 
I THINK I LOVE YOU 
I JUST LOOKED AT HIM AND THOUGHT OH MY GOD YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT ME HE DOES ABSOLUTELY 
I FELT REALLY BAD FOR YOU 
BUT IT JUST MADE ME FEEL SPECIAL 
LISTEN TO THE WAY SHE TALKS ABOUT HER DOG NOW I'M REALLY PROUD OF THEM HE'S GORGEOUS 
THAT FOR ME IS THE BEST BECAUSE NOW SHE VIEWS HER DOG REALLY DIFFERENTLY 
MIC'S STERN LECTURE ON TAZ'S DIET HAS MADE AN IMPRESSION ON FAYE 
SHE'S BECOME A STICKLER FOR THE RULES 
CONTROLLING WHAT HE EATS AND WHEN HE EATS 
IF I'D PUT THAT TIN ON THE FLOOR THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GONE BY NOW 
HE'D HAVE GONE STRAIGHT INTO IT THE TIN WOULD HAVE GONE ALL THE WAY AROUND THE 
AND HE'D HAVE EATEN THE LOT AND THAN DONE A BIG BURP 
SO THIS IS WORKING REALLY WELL FOR HIM 
SO I'LL PROBABLY KEEP THIS UP FOR A WHILE 
UNTIL WE'VE GOT HIM USED TO HAVING JUST THE BISCUITS AND NOT ANY MEAT 
GOOD BOY 
ONCE THE DOGS HAVE HAD THEIR RATIONS IT'S THE OWNERS' TURN 
WITH THE TEST LOOMING KAREN STILL DOESN'T SHARE LYNNE'S CONCERNS 
I UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE'S SAYING 
BUT SHE HASN'T SEEN THEM IN THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENT AS WELL 
I TRUST THE DOGS AND I TRUST MY DAUGHTER 
I HAVE NO QUALMS OF LEAVING MY FOUR YEAR OLD IN THE ROOM WITH MY DOGS AT ALL 
AT BORSTAL NOTHING ESCAPES HARD MAN MIC 
WHEN HE GETS WORD OF KAREN'S ADMISSION 
RAIGHT TO TRAINER LYNNE 
HER EXACT WORDS ARE SHE TRUSTS HER FOUR YEAR OLD IS IT A FOUR YEAR OLD 
SHE TRUSTS HER FOUR YEAR OLD WHAT 
TRUSTS HER FOUR YEAR OLD REALLY WELL AND NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND SHE TRUSTS HER DOGS 
WELL THEN I HOPE SOMEONE COMES AND TAKES THE DOGS OFF THEM 
BUT DIDN'T YOU TELL ME HER KIDS ARE MARKED ALREADY BY THESE DOGS 
YES SO WHAT IS SHE WAITING FOR TO HAPPEN 
WHY ARE YOU WASTING YOUR TIME WRITING THEM NOTES 
WHEN SHE AIN'T LISTENING TO A WORD YOU'RE SAYING 
SHE'S LETTING HER CHILD PLAY WITH A LOADED GUN 
RUSSIAN ROULETTE SPINNING IT AND SPINNING IT AND EVENTUALLY 
SHE'S GOING TO GET ON THE RIGHT ONE AND IS GOING TO PULL THE TRIGGER 
ALL THAT WORK YOU'VE DONE LYNNE I'M TELLING YOU NOW IS A WASTE OF TIME 
BUT I THINK HE REALLY NEEDS TO MAKE A STAND IF HE IS GETTING IT 
HE NEEDS TO BLOODY TELL HER 
HE NEEDS TO TELL HER 
WITH JUST HOURS TO THE TEST LYNNE'S HOPES OF GETTING 
BORSTAL'S WORST OFFENDERS TRAINED NOW REST WITH ONE MAN 
AFTER A SLOW START ROBERT'S TRAINING HAS STARTED TO PAY DIVIDENDS 
BUT NOW IT'S ADAM WHO COULD BE LEFT OUT IN THE COLD 
IT'S A REAL POSSIBILITY THAT PIPPA'S GOING TO END UP WITH ANOTHER DOG 
HE'S JUST MUCH MORE RESPONSIVE TO PIPPA 
KEANO KEANO 
KEANO O. K. PIPPA CALL HIM 
KEANO GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY THAT'S NOT SO GOOD IS IT 
IT'S O. K. 
I'M SORRY ADAM 
SO PIPPA CALLS HIM AND HE CAME STRAIGHT AWAY 
IT'S A REAL COMPETITION THING BETWEEN THEM ADAM'S LOSING 
UNLESS HE UPS HIS GAME HE'S NOT GONNA HAVE A COHORT 
HE'S GONNA BE ALONE AGAIN 
IT'S THE FINAL SESSION 
IF ADAM CAN'T CRACK THIS KEANO MIGHT FAIL TO GRADUATE 
JUST LET HIM GO NOW 
KEANO KEANO 
COME HERE GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY NOW THAT WORKED THAT'S BRILLIANT 
A REALLY GOOD POSITIVE RESULT FROM WHERE I'M STANDING THAT'S CALLING THEIR DOG RIGHT ACROSS THE FIELD 
HE'S COMING IN LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN 
HE'S NOT STOPPING TO SNIFF AND EXPLORE 
HE'S COMING WHEN THEY CALL HIM 
REALLY GOOD GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT 
THE FACT THAT WE DID THE RECALL FROM TWO HUNDRED YARDS AWAY IT WAS AMAZING REALLY GOOD 
AS KEANO'S BEHAVIOUR HAS IMPROVED 
SO HAVE RELATIONS BETWEEN HIS OWNERS 
IT SEEMS STRANGE AFTER TWO DAYS OF THIS TRAINING 
SHE'S COMPLETELY CHANGED HER ATTITUDE TOWARDS HIM IT'S GOOD 
IT'S THE LAST NIGHT IN BORSTAL AND THE OWNERS SETTLE DOWN FOR A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP 
TODAY WAS UNBELIEVABLE 
KEANO LISTENED TO EVERYTHING WE SAID 
MITCHELL MAX WILL PROBABLY WALK PAST ALL THE TESTS 
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO IT WE'RE NOT REALLY THAT BOTHERED 
BUT AFTER KAREN'S REVELATION 
TRAINER LYNNE HAS GOT A LOT TO THINK ABOUT 
IT'S JUDGEMENT DAY 
ALL THE DOGS AND THEIR OWNERS ARE UP EARLY 
YESTERDAY HE DIDN'T EVEN TAKE HIS PAWS OFF THE FLOOR TO JUMP UP AT ME AT ALL OR JUMP UP 
NOT EVEN JUST JUMP AT ME 
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT AND I CAN'T WAIT TO GET TAZ OUT AND GIVE IT A GO AND GET STUCK IN 
WITH THEIR REPUTATION ON THE LINE 
ALL THAT'S NORMALLY LEFT FOR THE TRAINERS TO DO IS SIT AND WAIT 
BUT LYNNE'S ABOUT TO DROP A BOMBSHELL 
I DON'T WANT TO DO THE TEST 
ALL RIGHT MATE LYNNE THINKS RICHARD AND KAREN 
HAVE LITTLE HOPE OF PASSING THE OFFICIAL TEST 
BUT THAT'S NOT HER MAIN CONCERN YOU KNOW THE TEST MEANS NOTHING 
WHAT MEANS SOMETHING TO ME IS THAT YOU TAKE HOME WHAT I'VE TAUGHT YOU 
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE ARE KIDS INVOLVED 
IF IT WAS JUST STOPPING YOUR DOG PULLING ON A LEAD 
I DON'T GIVE A STUFF IF YOUR DOG PULLS YOU ON THE LEAD FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE 
BEFORE SHE'LL LET THEM LEAVE SHE WANTS RICHARD TO TAKE A VERBAL TEST 
TO MAKE SURE HE DOES UNDERSTAND THE DANGEROUS DOGS ACT 
I THINK HE HAS TAKEN ON BOARD EVERYTHING THAT I'VE TOLD HIM 
HE IS DETERMINED TO PUT IT ALL INTO PLACE 
I'D JUST SAY 
GET IN YOUR CAR AND OFF 
I TRAIN DIFFERENTLY TO YOU AND I'VE GOT DIFFERENT VIEWS FROM YOU 
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS IF GIVING HIM THE CHANCE TO TAKE THIS TEST 
WILL HELP HIM TO MAKE SURE THAT HE PUTS IN THESE CONTROLS THAT I'VE ASKED HIM TO PUT IN 
AND WILL HELP HIM TO HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE ABOUT THAT SIDE OF IT 
IT'S LIKE A TEAM THING YES BUT THAT'S IRRELEVANT 
IF IT'S GOING TO HELP WITH HIM BEING ABLE TO LAY DOWN SOME RULES 
BECAUSE HE FEELS GOOD ABOUT TAKING THE TEST THEN I SHOULD GIVE HIM THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT 
SO RICHARD HEADS OFF TO FACE THE JUDGE 
HE'S MY ONLY HOPE OF GETTING THROUGH TO THIS FAMILY 
THAT THEY HAVE GOT A BIG PROBLEM 
BORSTAL'S GUEST ADJUDICATOR IS DOG EXPERT KENDAL SHEPHERD 
HER WORD IS FINAL IN DECIDING WHO WILL MAKE THE GRADE AT BORSTAL THIS WEEK 
SO RICHARD PLANS TO PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS TO IMPRESS HER 
THERE MAY BE TROUBLE AHEAD 
BUT WHILE THERE'S MOONLIGHT AND MUSIC AND LOVE AND ROMANCE 
LET'S FACE THE MUSIC AND DANCE 
HELLO HELLO HOW DO YOU FEEL WITH THINGS SO FAR 
I THINK HE'S DONE REALLY WELL 
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WALK HIM DOWN LIKE THAT WITHOUT HAVING 
DOWN DOWN LET'S GO INSIDE 
BACK AT HOME BAD BOYS MITCHELL AND MAX WERE OUT OF CONTROL 
MITCHELL 
TODAY OWNER RICHARD IS TWENTY QUESTIONS AWAY FROM FREEDOM 
MY TIME WITH THEM IS OFFICIALLY OVER 
I CAN'T DO ANY MORE 
IT'S UP TO THEM NOW IT'S IN THEIR HANDS 
HAS ANY OF LYNNE'S TRAINING SUNK IN 
WHICH OF YOUR CHILDREN ARE ALLOWED TO WALK MITCHELL 
NONE 
WHERE SHOULD MITCHELL AND MAX BE WITHIN THE HIERARCHY OF THEIR HUMAN SLASH CANINE PACK 
BELOW US 
WHEN SHOULD THE CHILDREN SPEND UNSUPERVISED TIME WITH THE DOG 
NEVER WHAT DO YOU NEED TO TRAIN MITCHELL AND MAX TO DO WITHOUT FAIL 
BEFORE YOU CONSIDER LETTING THEM OFF LEAD IN THE PARK 
RECALL 
GOOD 
RIGHT YOU'VE CERTAINLY GOT THESE ARE CERTAINLY ABSOLUTELY CORRECT ANSWERS 
BUT IN A FORMAL WAY YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY PASS 
RICHARD'S GIVEN THE RIGHT ANSWERS 
BUT WITHOUT TAKING THE OFFICIAL TEST IT WON'T BE ENOUGH TO GRADUATE 
IT'S NOT WHAT WE CAME FOR ANYWAY 
WE CAME TO GET SOME EXPERT ADVICE AND AS MUCH ADVICE AS WE COULD GET 
WAYS OF EXERCISING PRACTICE RULES AND WE GOT THAT 
ALL I CAN HOPE IS THAT THEY GO AWAY FROM HERE AND SOMETHING RINGS A BELL WITH THEM 
WITH ONE DOG ALREADY FAILING TO MAKE THE GRADE THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON THE OTHERS 
THEY'RE A LITTLE NERVOUS I THINK 
I JUST HOPE THEY DON'T CARRY THAT INTO THE TASK 
IF THEY DO THEY'LL FAIL TODAY AS WELL 
JUST FOUR DAYS AGO THERE WAS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN PIPPA AND KEANO 
STOP IT I DON'T LIKE HIM AND I DON'T LOVE HIM 
SHE'S LEARNT TO LOVE KEANO BUT CAN SHE CONTROL HIM HI I'M KENDAL 
HI KENDAL AH AH LEAVE 
PIPPA IS DETERMINED NOT TO FAIL 
BUT JUST AS THE TEST BEGINS DOG BORSTAL'S ALARM SYSTEM MALFUNCTIONS 
YOU'VE GOT THE ADDED DISTRACTION OF THIS ALARM IT'S DRIVING MY EAR MAD 
BUT WILL PIPPA HOLD HER NERVE 
LEAVE SHE MUST KEEP KEANO FOCUSED BY USING THE LEAVE COMMAND 
GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
LOOK I'M SMILING NOW BECAUSE YOU WERE A GOOD BOY 
NEXT UP IS ADAM HE'LL BE TESTED ON SOMETHING HE'S STRUGGLED WITH ALL WEEK RECALL 
KEANO THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON THIS 
IF HE'S NOT SUCCESSFUL THEY'LL BE LEAVING BORSTAL WITH THEIR TAIL BETWEEN THEIR LEGS 
GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY HAS KEANO PROVED HE'S WORTHY OF A PASS 
AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO SAY YOU'VE BOTH PASSED WITH DISTINCTION 
SO WELL DONE BOTH OF YOU 
WELL DONE 
FANTASTIC WELL DONE 
NOT THAT I HAD ANY DOUBT AT ALL 
THE FINAL INMATE TO FACE THE JUDGE IS TAZ AND HIS OWNER FAYE 
FOUR DAYS AGO TAZ PULLED ON THE LEAD AND DID AS HE PLEASED 
NOW HAVE THEY LEARNED ENOUGH TO PASS 
I'M FAYE I'M KENDAL SO I'M GOING TO BE YOUR JUDGE 
HOW'RE YOU FEELING A BIT NERVOUS THE FIRST PART OF THEIR TEST IS LEAD WORK 
MIC WATCHES ON FROM UNDERCOVER 
NOW DO A RIGHT TURN 
RIGHT TURN 
RIGHT TURN THIS THIS ISN'T GOING TO PLAN 
OH YES YES RIGHT 
SHE'LL LOSE MARKS FOR EVERYTHING SHE DOES WRONG 
THE NEXT TEST IS SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL 
THE JUDGE HIDES TAZ'S FAVOURITE TOY AND TAZ MUST FIND THE SCENT 
IT'S NOT EASY WHERE IS IT 
THEY'RE STILL AT IT 
GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
THE FINAL PART OF TAZ'S TEST IS AGILITY 
THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE ANY MORE MARKS IF THEY HOPE TO PASS 
GO ON TAZ GO ON GOOD BOY GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
COME ON TAZ UP GOOD BOY 
HUP 
HUP GOOD BOY 
YOU COULD PUT MUSIC TO IT IT'S FANTASTIC 
GOOD BOY HUP UP STAND 
GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
SO IT'S THE MOMENT OF TRUTH HAS FAYE'S HANDLING MADE THE GRADE 
I THINK YOU'VE REALLY TRIED HARD AND ACTUALLY YOU HAVE PASSED WITH DISTINCTION OH BRILLIANT 
ALL RIGHT WELL DONE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO PLEASED 
WELL DONE THERE'S YOUR CERTIFICATE 
LOOK AT THAT LOOK AT THAT TAZ 
I'M REALLY PLEASED SHOCKED BECAUSE WE MESSED UP A BIT 
AT THE BEGINNING BUT THAT WAS A NICE SURPRISE AND I'M REALLY HAPPY 
AND SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE 
WHAT CAN I SAY I KNEW 
I SAID TO THEM DOWN THERE 
IF SHE HASN'T GOT A RED I'LL EAT MY MANUAL 
OH DEAR HOW'D YOU FEEL MATE REALLY PLEASED HAPPY 
YEAH 
BRILLIANT THAT'S GOOD 
I'M HAPPY YOU'RE HAPPY AND HE'S KNACKERED ISN'T HE YEAH 
ANOTHER HAPPY CUSTOMER OVER THE MOON 
THAT'S GOOD VERY GOOD 
THAT'S USUALLY A GOOD INCENTIVE TO PEOPLE TO WANT TO GET AWAY 
NOT HAVING TO SEE ME AGAIN TOMORROW MORNING 
D'YOU THINK I'LL GET A CHRISTMAS CARD 
I DON'T KNOW MIGHT DO 
IT'S BEEN A WEEK OF MIXED FORTUNES AT DOG BORSTAL 
ONE GROUP OF INMATES ARE ON PAROLE 
BUT THE OTHERS HAVE GRADUATED WITH DISTINCTION 
HAVE MITCHELL AND MAX MADE ANY PROGRESS 
WATCH THE OTHER DOGS 
DOG'S BEEN QUITE A LOT CALMER 
HE'S BEEN CALMER A LOT OF THE THINGS WE'VE PUT INTO PRACTICE AND THEY'VE WORKED 
MITCHELL'S HARDLY JUMPED UP SINCE WE COME BACK AT ALL REALLY 
HE DIDN'T COME BOUNDING AT YOU LIKE HE USED TO 
HE STILL IS A BOUNCY DOG BUT HE'S NOT AS IN YOUR FACE 
AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE'S GOT TO BE ONE FAILURE HASN'T THERE 
WE WERE IT 
HAS BORDER TERRIER KEANO MENDED HIS WAYS 
THE BIG DIFFERENCE FOR ME IS THAT I ACTUALLY REALLY ENJOY BEING AROUND HIM NOW 
BEFORE DOG BORSTAL I HATED HIM 
AND I HATED YOU FOR HAVING SUCH A HORRIBLE DOG 
COME ON GOOD BOY 
NOW WE ACTUALLY FIGHT OVER THE GOOD DOG AND WHO GETS TO WALK HIM 
AND WHO GETS TO HOLD THE TREATS SO HE GETS MORE ATTENTION FROM ME 
I THINK WE DEFINITELY HAVE BONDED AS A FAMILY 
BECAUSE HE'S MORE FUN AND HE'S MORE ENJOYABLE 
BARK WOOF GOOD BOY 
YEAH I DON'T HATE EITHER OF THEM ANY MORE 
AND IS TAZ A REFORMED COUCH POTATO 
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS WALKING AND I CAN HANDLE HIM A LOT BETTER 
IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD 
GOOD BOY 
I THINK HE KNOWS NOW THAT I CAN TELL HIM NO 
AND I KNOW THAT HE'S GOING TO RESPOND TO WHAT I SAY 
GOOD BOY 
COME HERE 
SIT DOWN 
GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY BUT HE'S NOT COMPLETELY REFORMED 
UGH HE'S FARTED 
THAT STINKS YOU MONKEY 
CAN YOU SMELL IT YET
