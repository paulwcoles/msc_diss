VERY GOOD JENNY TODAY WE ARE ON A MISSION TO FIND A DREAM HOME 
AND TURN IT INTO A LOVE ZONE 
TODAY WE'RE IN WILTSHIRE LOOKING FOR HOUSES IN THE AREA SURROUNDING LONGLEAT 
JENNY DID YOU KNOW THIS ORIGINAL SITE WAS BOUGHT FOR ONLY FIFTY THREE 
FIFTY THREE UNLESS OUR BUYER'S A DOLL I DON'T THINK WE WILL FIND A HOUSE FOR THAT PRICE 
DON'T WORRY NO ROOM FOR LOW BUDGETS TODAY 
WE HAVE TO FIND HOUSES SO GOOD THAT TOURISTS COMING TO LONGLEAT WILL BE WILLING TO STAY IN THEM 
SOUNDS LIKE A HOLIDAY TO ME 
NO IT'S A FIVE STAR CHALLENGE 
THESE HOUSES HAVE TO HAVE B. AND AMP B. POTENTIAL LUXURY B. AND AMP B. POTENTIAL 
AND WHEN WE FIND THOSE THREE PERFECT PROPERTIES WE'LL GIVE OUR BUYER THE CHANCE 
TO TRY BEFORE SHE BUYS 
CHECKING IN TODAY IS BUYER CATHY WARTON 
CATHY IS A RETIRED HEAD TEACHER FROM SUSSEX AND IS RELOCATING TO THE WEST COUNTRY 
SHE IS LOOKING FOR A NEW HOME NEAR LONGLEAT 
WHERE SHE CAN START A NEW LIFE AS A B. AND AMP B. PROPRIETOR 
SHE'S BROUGHT HER BROTHER PAUL SANSON ALONG TO HELP HER 
PAUL'S A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER WHICH MEANS HE KNOWS WHAT LOOKS GOOD 
HE'S THE IDEAL PERSON TO HELP CATHY CHOOSE THAT PICTURE PERFECT HOUSE 
SO CATHY PAUL GOOD PLACE TO START BED AND BREAKFAST 
B. AND AMP B. IS NOT WHAT YOU TRAINED IT'S NOT WHAT YOU DID 
YOU DID SOMETHING ELSE UNTIL RECENTLY 
I WAS A TEACHER AND THEN A HEAD TEACHER 
RIGHT SO YOU THOUGHT AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS WORKING LONG HOURS 
JUST LIKE TEACHERS DO YOU'D DO SOMETHING MUCH MORE RELAXING 
DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AFTER PEOPLE 
JUST MAKE THE BED TAKE THE MONEY THAT'S IT ISN'T IT 
IT WOULD BE GOOD TO THINK IT WAS THAT EASY 
IT'S GONNA BE HARD WORK 
YES BUT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
WHAT KIND OF B. AND AMP B. ARE YOU GOING TO RUN 
I WANT IT TO BE A TOP END LUXURY END OF THE MARKET 
GAP IN THE MARKET YOU THINK I HOPE SO 
I'VE LOOKED AT AS MY RESEARCH 
THERE'S PLENTY FOR THE LOWER END BUT MAYBE FOR THE TOP END WE NEED SOME 
SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN THEN VERY FLUFFY BATHROBES 
WELL MAYBE BUT IT'S CONTEMPORARY STYLE 
AND MINIMALIST NOT FRILLY BEDSPREADS O. K. 
WHAT NO DOILIES NOT EVEN ONE 
YOU DON'T DO DOILIES BUT DO YOU DO COUNTRYSIDE 
I LOVE COUNTRYSIDE I WANT TO HAVE SOME DUCKS 
DO YOU WANT A FAMILY B. AND AMP B. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN INVOLVED WITH CHILDREN 
OR HAVE YOU HAD ENOUGH OF ALL THAT NOISE 
I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO BE WITHOUT THE CHILDREN 
SO IT'LL BE A VERY GROWN UP AFFAIR 
ROMANTIC COUPLES I THINK 
PAUL BEING A PHOTOGRAPHER YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT A GOOD EYE FOR THINGS 
HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HELP YOUR SISTER OUT WHEN LOOKING FOR A PLACE 
YOU HAVE ANOTHER INTEREST IN THIS PROPERTY THAT WE ARE GOING TO FIND 
WE ARE HOPING THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND A PROPERTY 
THAT HAS SOME POTENTIAL FOR SOME GALLERY SPACE 
I TRAVEL THE COUNTRY TO MAJOR RETAIL SHOWS 
SELLING MY PHOTOGRAPHS AND I'M ALWAYS BEING ASKED 
WHERE MY GALLERY IS SO IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE 
TO HAVE SOME PERMANENT LOCATION FOR THAT SIDE OF THE BUSINESS 
IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE THIS ONE WE DON'T JUST HAVE TO SATISFY YOU 
WE HAVE TO SATISFY ALL YOUR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS 
AND WHAT'S THE STATE OF THE PROPERTY SUPPOSED TO BE 
WELL I DON'T MIND IT BEING A WRECK TO START WITH 
I AM QUITE HAPPY TO DO IT UP TO HOW I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE 
I WANT THE ROOMS TO HAVE EN SUITE BATHROOMS 
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HOUSES I'LL GET WITH EN SUITE BATHROOMS 
SO I SUSPECT I MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOME WORK 
HOW MUCH HAVE WE GOT TO SPEND ON THIS KIND OF PROPERTY 
WELL IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT WAS CLOSE TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
BUT I WOULD GO UP TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
FIVE HUNDRED K. THEN FIVE HUNDRED K. IT'S A HEALTHY BUDGET THEN THAT'S A HEALTHY BUDGET 
ON THAT NOTE WE WILL LEAVE IS THAT YOUR CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST 
YEAH O. K. IF I TAKE A BIT OF PAIN AU CHOCOLAT 
SORRY SHE'S TAKEN THE PAIN AU CHOCOLAT 
CATCH UP WITH YOU IN A MOMENT 
AH LOVELY 
JENNY THIS IS A BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN USUAL LOTS OF WORK TO DO 
YEAH I HAVE TO EAT THIS FOR A START 
I'VE WRITTEN EVERYTHING DOWN THAT CATHY WANTS 
HERE WE GO FOUR BEDROOMS PREFERABLY EN SUITE 
A GALLERY FOR PAUL ROOM FOR DUCKS AND ALL WITHIN A TEN MILE RADIUS OF LONGLEAT 
VERY GOOD JENNY BUT REMEMBER CONTEMPORARY CHIC MODERN 
IS WHAT CATHY IS AFTER CERTAINLY NO DOILIES 
I'M OFF TO TALK TO ESTATE AGENTS ABOUT PROPERTIES IN THE AREA AROUND LONGLEAT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO 
I'M JUST GOING TO GO AND CHECK UP ON SOME B. AND AMP B. BUSINESS SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER 
ALL RIGHT SEE YOU LATER YEAH 
LONGLEAT RANKS AS ONE OF BRITAIN'S LEADING TOURIST ATTRACTIONS 
LAST YEAR NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND VISITORS PASSED THROUGH ITS GATES 
NEAR THE WILTSHIRE AND SOMERSET COUNTRYSIDE THE SURROUNDING AREA 
IS HOME TO BUSTLING MARKET TOWNS AND PICTURESQUE VILLAGES 
THE NEARBY TOWN OF FROME HAS MORE LISTED BUILDINGS THAN ANY OTHER TOWN IN SOMERSET 
AND THE CITY OF BATH IS JUST A SHORT HOP AWAY 
WITH AN ARRAY OF ATTRACTIONS AND A THRIVING TOURIST TRADE 
THE AREA IS A SENSIBLE CHOICE FOR CATHY'S B. AND AMP B. 
HOUSE PRICES IN THE AREA RANGE FROM ONE THIRTY K. FOR A FLAT 
TO AN AVERAGE OF THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR A DETACHED HOUSE 
BUT WHAT WILL A HANDSOME FIVE HUNDRED GRAND BUDGET BUY YOU AROUND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
WELL NEAR BURNLEY IN LANCASHIRE 
IT WILL GET YOU THIS SEVENTEENTH CENTURY HOUSE WITH FOUR LARGE BEDROOMS 
AND A MEDIEVAL BANQUETING HALL NOT BAD FOR A KING'S RANSOM OF HALF A MILLION POUNDS 
THAT'S NOT BAD BUT IN LEEK STAFFORDSHIRE 
YOU COULD HAVE THIS SPACIOUS FIVE BEDROOM FARMHOUSE 
SET IN SIX ACRES OF LAND BUT IT TOO WILL SET YOU BACK HALF A MILLION QUID 
AND IN HOLLYWELL CHESHIRE THERE'S THIS FORMER MILL 
WITH FIVE BEDROOMS TWO EN SUITES AND JUST OVER ONE AND A HALF ACRES OF LAND 
A POUND SHORT OF THE FULL WHACK AT FOUR HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
BUT ENOUGH OF HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVE 
LET'S GET BACK TO BUSINESS B. AND AMP B. BUSINESS 
I HAVE AN EXCITING ONE TODAY I'M LOOKING FOR A B. AND AMP B. NOT FOR ME TO STAY IN OBVIOUSLY 
NOW THIS HOTEL LOOKS LIKE A GOOD PLACE FOR RESEARCH 
WHAT SORT OF PROPERTY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR FOUR BEDROOMS DEFINITELY 
AND SHE WOULD LOVE EN SUITES IN ALL OF THEM AND SHE WANTS TO GO HIGH END 
KIND OF PLACE YOU AND I MIGHT GO TO FLAT SCREEN T. V.'S THAT KIND OF THING EXCELLENT 
YEAH IF SHE GETS A POOL WITH THE B. AND AMP B. SHE'LL HAVE TO HAVE A POOL CLEANER 
EXCUSE ME JUST MISSED A BIT 
AND SHE HAS GOT A COOL HALF A MILLION TO SPEND UP TO THAT ANYWAY 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK I AM REALLY GETTING INTO THE SWING OF THIS PROPERTY HUNTING 
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HER BROTHER HE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER 
HE'D QUITE LIKE IT IF THERE WAS A GALLERY OR OUTBUILDING HE COULD EXHIBIT HIS STUFF IN 
RIGHT O. K. LET'S HAVE A LOOK FOR YOU 
WHAT'S FROME LIKE AS A TOURIST DESTINATION THEN LAYLA 
VERY UP AND COMING OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE ATTRACTIONS SUCH AS LONGLEAT

WHICH IS NEXT TO LONGLEAT AS WELL GREAT SUMMER SPOT 
SHE WANTS LUXURY 
BATHROBE SLIPPERS COTTON WOOL BUDS 
AND THEN ALL THE LOVELY SMELLIES THAT GO WITH IT 
LIKE IT 
SO THE A THREE SIXTY ONE WILL THAT BE A BUSY BUSY ROAD 
THAT IS A BUSY ROAD WOULD THAT BE OFF PUTTING 
DOES THAT ATTRACT MORE TRAVELLING SALESMEN THAN PEOPLE ON A ROMANTIC BREAK 
I WOULD SAY ALL SORTS 
IF WE WANT TO SEE ONE OF THESE COULD I GIVE YOU A CALL TODAY 
YEP OF COURSE TAKE MY DETAILS 
AND IF YOU'VE ANY QUERIES OR WANT TO VIEW THEM GIVE ME A CALL 
THAT WORKED OUT RATHER WELL 
EXCUSE ME ARE YOU STAYING IN THE HOTEL JUST VISITING 
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU GO UNDER A LOW BRIDGE DUCK GET IT 
NEVER MIND THAT BIRD I FEEL ALL ROMANTIC WHAT A LOVELY SPOT

IN FACT I FOUND CLASS 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CLASS WELL I'M TAKING HER BACK TO SCHOOL AREN'T I 
YOU SEE IT'S THE OLD SCHOOL HOUSE 
THIS IS THE KIND OF PLACE THAT WOULD MAKE THE PERFECT B. AND AMP B. 
IT'S GOT FOUR BEDROOMS THE GARDEN BACKS ONTO A LITTLE BABBLING BROOK 
FULL OF BAGS OF ORIGINAL CHARACTER 
AND IF YOU DROVE PAST THIS YOU'D WANT TO GO INSIDE REALLY 
IT LOOKS VERY NICE FROM THE OUTSIDE LOTS OF KERB APPEAL 
AND A VILLAGE LOCATION BRILLIANT O. K. I'VE GONE FOR THE TOWN MY FIRST PROPERTY HERE RIGHT 
IT'S A VICTORIAN PROPERTY AS YOU CAN SEE 
BUT WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE INSIDE LOOK AT THAT 
LOOK AT THE QUALITY OF THE GLOSSY BROCHURE 
ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS I CAN'T FAULT IT TO BE HONEST 
AND THERE IS A GREAT PLACE FOR PAUL'S GALLERY 
AT THE END OF THE GARDEN AND A HUGE GARAGE NEED I SAY MORE 
APART FROM GLOSS IS WHAT YOU GET NOT JUST ON MY LIPS 
WELL YOU'VE GOT A SEMI IN FROME BASICALLY 
SO WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT FOR THE WILD CARD FEAST YOUR EYES ON THAT 
HOLCOMBE REMINDS ME OF DALLAS BIG ISN'T IT 
SUPER GLOSSY LOOK AT THAT ALMOST EVERY BEDROOM'S GOT AN EN SUITE 
SO IT'S ALREADY PERFECTLY SET UP TO BE A BED AND BREAKFAST 
HOW CLEVER ARE YOU WHY IS IT THE WILD CARD 
BECAUSE IT'S A BIT FURTHER OUT NOT REALLY NEAR A VILLAGE OR TOWN 
BUT WE'RE GIVING THEM CHOICE COS WE ARE GIVING THEM COUNTRYSIDE SO OUR WILD CARD'S IN THE WILD 
YEAH SHALL WE CHECK IN THEN TO PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
PROPERTY ONE MY CHOICE IS VERY APT A CONVERTED VILLAGE SCHOOLHOUSE 
IN CODFORD SAINT MARY WITH ITS PICTURE BOOK EXTERIOR 
COSY BRICK FIREPLACES AND SPACIOUS DOUBLE BEDROOMS 
IT HAS BED AND BREAKFAST CHALKED ALL OVER IT 
THERE IS EVEN A LOVELY STREAM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN 
I'M NOT SURE A RETIRED HEADMISTRESS WOULD WANT TO LIVE IN A SCHOOLHOUSE 
BUT I ADMIT IT DOES HAVE CHOCOLATE BOX APPEAL 
AND YOU COULD HAVE A NAUGHTY WEEKEND UNDER HEAD TEACHER'S ROOF 
YEAH JENNY LET'S SEE IF CATHY GIVES IT TOP MARKS THOUGH 
BROUGHT YOU ALONG TO PROPERTY NUMBER ONE MY CHOICE 
AND WE ARE IN THE LOVELY VILLAGE OF CODFORD SAINT MARY 
CODFORD SAINT PETER'S JUST DOWN THERE 
JENNY AND I HAD TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THIS 
TRYING TO FIND SOMEWHERE THAT WORKS WELL AS A B. AND AMP B. 
YOU'VE JUST STOPPED WORKING IN A SCHOOL AND I'M BRINGING YOU BACK TO ONE OH NO 
DON'T SAY OH NO YOU SAID YOU LOVED BEING A TEACHER I DID 
I'VE CHOSEN THIS BECAUSE IT STANDS OUT IN THE VILLAGE 
AND IF I WAS DRIVING PAST GOING SOMEWHERE 
I'D BE CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT'S INSIDE AND WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO LIVE THERE 
INSIDE NEEDS SOME WORK SOME MODERNISATION 
BUT I THINK IT IS RIPE TO TURN INTO THAT CHIC BOUTIQUE B. AND AMP B. YOU WANT TO RUN 
AND YOU'LL BE VERY PLEASED TO KNOW HE'S CERTAINLY DONE HIS HOMEWORK 
OH 
WHAT I LOVE IT'S REALLY QUIRKY 
THE SCHOOL BELL'S STILL UP THERE 
SO HOPEFULLY THIS ONE IN IAN'S CASE IS GONNA RING YOUR BELL 
I'VE BEEN THINKING LONG AND HARD ABOUT ALL THESE 
SO YOU'VE GOT A GOOD EYE FOR THINGS WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
I THINK IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS THAT FRONTAGE IS REALLY EXCELLENT YES 
IT'LL STAND OUT AND IT LOOKS AMAZING ALL RIGHT IN YOU GO 
IT IS NEARLY TIME FOR FIRST LESSON 
POP IN AND WE'LL BE LISTENING TO SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF IT 
ALL RIGHT TALK TO YOU AFTERWARDS O. K. THANK YOU 
YOU'VE BEEN IN A FEW DETENTIONS IN YOUR TIME HAVEN'T YOU NEVER 
I WAS A VERY GOOD GIRL AT SCHOOL 
HEY IAN WHAT I WONDER WHAT THEIR SCHOOL OF THOUGHT IS ON THIS ONE 
MOST IMPRESSIVE FANTASTIC ENTRANCE ISN'T IT 
I LOVE THESE TILES ON THE FLOOR GORGEOUS 
THE MINTON FLOOR TILES I LOVE THE SENSE OF HISTORY ABOUT THIS BUILDING 
THE FLOOR TILES ARE WORN AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY IMAGINE 
ALL THOSE KIDS COMING IN AND WEARING THE FLOOR DOWN 
I LIKE THIS GALLERY 
THAT'S BRILLIANT I CAN IMAGINE ALL YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS UP THERE ON THAT YOU CAN YEP 
AND THIS BEAUTIFUL STONE THAT LOOKS AMAZING 
I CAN'T IMAGINE HAVING A FIRE IN THERE AS IT'S A BIT CLOSE TO 
IT YOU LIT A FIRE IN THERE YOUR STAIRCASE WOULD BURN DOWN 
NOW THAT IS A FIREPLACE 
IT'S SUPERB LOOK AT THE SIZE OF IT A PROPER INGLENOOK THAT'S RIGHT 
NO AN INGLENOOK IS WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO IN AND SIT WITHIN THE FIREPLACE 
LIGHT ALL AROUND 
YES IT'S A VERY LIGHT ROOM WITH THOSE BIG DOORS OUT ONTO THE GARDEN 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE IT IS 
THERE IS SOMETHING LOVELY ABOUT HAVING A CONVERTED SCHOOLHOUSE BUT ALSO SOMETHING A BIT SAD 
IT'S SAD THAT WHERE THOSE KIDS THEY'RE ALL GROWN UP NOW THEY WORK IN BANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES 
OR POSSIBLY THEY'RE PRESENTERS ON TELEVISION 
WHAT WE GOT IN HERE THIS LOOKS LIKE THE DINING ROOM 
IT'S YOUR BREAKFAST ROOM OBVIOUSLY THIS IS YOUR BREAKFAST ROOM 
IT'S AN O. K. SIZE IT'S NOT HUGE BUT I COULD GET A BIGGER TABLE IN HERE FOR THE BED AND BREAKFAST YES 
WE CAN MAKE THE MARMALADE 
VERY VERY LABOUR INTENSIVE MAKING MARMALADE JENNY 
YEAH BUT AS A TEAM WE'D DO IT 
WOW THAT'S A S. L. RPRI S. E. 
YES A LIBRARY FOR ALL MY BOOKS AS WELL 
SCHOOL TEACHERS ALWAYS HAVE LOTS OF BOOKS 
SHE MAY HAVE RETIRED BUT IT NEVER LEAVES YOU SHE'LL HAVE THOSE BOOKS WHEREVER SHE GOES 
I DON'T MEAN READING BOOKS I MEAN THE ONES WHERE SHE'S GOING 
OH AND THEN THERE IS IAN'S BOOK CROSS CROSS CROSS 
OH THE KITCHEN 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS FLOOR THIS REALLY HITS YOU AS YOU WALK IN 
I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THAT 
TOTALLY DOMINATES THE ROOM DOESN'T IT IT DOES 
AND IT IS A GOOD SIZE KITCHEN BUT I'D REPLACE THE UNITS 
IT'S NOT THE CONTEMPORARY STYLE I WANT O. K. 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE LITTLE WINDOW BUT IT'S 
THIS IS THE FIRST ONE I'VE BEEN INTO WHICH IS A BIT DARK 
YOU DO GET THE ASPECT ON THE GARDEN YES BUT THIS IS WHERE 
I'D WANT THE WASHING UP BOWL TO BE SO I CAN LOOK OUT AND ENJOY IT 
I'D RATHER BUY A DISHWASHER 
OH HE'D RATHER HAVE A DISHWASHER YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS WORRIED ABOUT 
COMING OVER TO PUT UP A FEW PICTURES 
THEN YOU SEE HIM WALKING ROUND WITH AN APRON AND TRAY 
AND THEN THERE'S THIS FANTASTIC PANTRY OUT HERE I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A PANTRY THIS LOOKS GOOD 
I LIKE THE LITTLE LARDER A LARDER CUM UTILITY ROOM 
THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT YOUR FRIDGE FREEZER 
YES A GOOD SIZE ONE FOR ALL THOSE EGGS AND BACON 
WE'VE BEEN IN THAT LARDER IT'S THE BEST LARDER WE'VE EVER BEEN IN 
CAN I JUST STOP YOU THERE 
NOW THEY ARE COMPLIMENTARY BISCUITS 
I REALLY CAN'T IMAGINE HOW THIS BUILDING WAS A SCHOOL 
I CAN'T SEE HOW IT WAS LAID OUT ORIGINALLY AT ALL NO 
COULD YOU SEE YOURSELF RUNNING A B. AND AMP B. LET'S TURN THAT ROUND 
CAN YOU EVER SEE ME RUNNING A B. AND AMP B. NO 
OH THIS LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER NICE LIGHT AIRY ROOM 
THE DUEL ASPECT IS SUPERB ISN'T IT 
IT'S THE SORT OF ROOM I'D LIKE TO STAY IN 
SO I THINK OTHER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT 
THERE'S AN EN SUITE ROUND HERE OH I HOPE SO 
I NEED MY EN SUITES THERE IS INDEED 
AND IT'S QUITE A GOOD SIZE I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THE COLOUR 
THE EN SUITE AND THE MAIN BATHROOM ACTUALLY ARE WHAT YOU'D CALL VINTAGE 
WHOLE THING NEEDS RE DOING DOESN'T IT IT DOES DEFINITELY 
BUT IT WILL BE FANTASTIC WITH THE WINDOW OUTSIDE IT'S AMAZING 
OH HERE WE ARE IN THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
AGAIN IT'S VERY DATED AND I IMAGINE LOTS OF NICE LIMESTONE 
AND THE MODERN MATERIALS AND CHROME IT WOULD LOOK REALLY SMART 
IT'S A WOMAN WITH VISION WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE CATHY HAS GOT VISION 
IT'S A BIT DIFFICULT TO OPEN THIS DOOR WITH THAT BED THERE O. K. 
THAT'S A FAIR SIZED ROOM THERE 
IT'S GOT A DOUBLE BED IN BUT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE EN SUITE FOR THIS 
ALTHOUGH MAYBE KNOCK THROUGH TO THAT ONE NEXT DOOR POSSIBLY 
I THINK IT'S QUITE EASY TO CONVERT THIS IT WOULD TAKE A COUPLE OF STEPS AND YOU'D BE THERE 
HAVE YOU NOTICED ALL THESE CREAKY FLOORBOARDS AS WE ARE WALKING ROUND 
DEFINITELY STOP PEOPLE GETTING IN QUIETLY LATE AT NIGHT 
I THINK IT'S QUITE FUNNY 
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE LYING IN YOUR BED THINKING OH MRS. TIGGYWINKLE'S COME BACK 
I'M NOT SURE THIS IS BIG ENOUGH AT ALL REALLY 
IT'S GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AS WE'VE GONE FROM THE BIGGEST AND THEN WE ARE GETTING SMALLER YES 
IT'S LIKE THE LAST BEDROOM 
O. K. THIS IS BETTER AGAIN 
YES IT IS LIKE A MIRROR IMAGE OF THE OTHER END ISN'T IT 
ALTHOUGH IT HASN'T GOT EN SUITE IT'S JUST GOT A BASIN 
IT'S A LOVELY FEEL TO THE HOUSE BUT IT'S JUST NOT BIG ENOUGH SOMEHOW 
AS MUCH AS I HATE TO SAY IT I DON'T THINK THEY LIKE THIS PLACE MUCH 
DON'T WORRY JENNY I'M GOING TO SEE THEM AFTER CLASS 
IN TERMS OF SPACE I KNOW YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THIS END OF THE HOUSE M. M. M. 
UNFORTUNATELY IF THIS BECOMES A BUSINESS 
YOU HAVE TO GIVE AWAY THE BEST BEDROOMS I ACCEPT THAT 
I THINK UPSTAIRS THE GREAT THING IT'S NOT LISTED AND IT'S A CONVERSION 
ALL STUD WALLS 
SO QUITE EASY TO MOVE THINGS AROUND 
YOU COULD TURN THIS INTO A MUCH MORE USEABLE SPACE 
SOMETHING MIGHT KIND OF GET A B. PLUS RATHER THAN A C. THAT YOU ARE GIVING IT AT THE MOMENT GOOD IDEA 
CAN YOU AFFORD TO DO ALL THE WORK 
IT IS TIME TO GUESS THE PRICE 
I NEED TO KNOW ARE YOU AND YOUR BROTHER PAUL COMPETITIVE WE ARE VERY QUITE 
WILL ONE OF YOU GET IN A HUFF IF YOU DON'T WIN PROBABLY OH DEAR 
LET'S GO AND FIND THEM AND SEE HOW WE GET ON WITH IT O. K. 
I BET YOU THINK THIS IS JUST A GARAGE YEP 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST A GARAGE AT ALL BECAUSE ORIGINALLY 
IF YOU LOOK FROM THE PANELLING THERE AND THE PINBOARDS THIS WAS A SCHOOLROOM 
IT'S MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN YOU WOULD THINK AND IT IS TAILOR MADE FOR USE AS A GALLERY 
EXACTLY THE ONLY THING IS IF YOU ARE GOING TO THINK OF MAKING THIS INTO SOMETHING MORE COMMERCIAL 
THEN YOU'D HAVE TO GET PLANNING FROM THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT THAT IS SOMETHING YOU CAN PURSUE 
AN EASY CONVERSION BUT ONE THAT IS STILL GOING TO COST 
AND OF COURSE THAT DOES LEAD US NICELY ON TO GUESS THE PRICE 
SO ARE YOU COMPETITIVE WITH YOUR SISTER NO NOT REALLY 
NO AH HOW LOVELY I'M SURE SHE'LL AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT 
APPARENTLY YOU'RE NOT COMPETITIVE I'M GOING TO COMPETE WITH HIM 
WE JUST OVERHEARD THAT AND WE CHUCKLED BECAUSE CATHY SAYS THAT YOU TWO ARE COMPETITIVE 
THIS WILL BE INTERESTING THEN 
SO THE BUDGET WAS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AS YOU BOTH KNOW 
WHO'D LIKE TO GO FIRST I SUPPOSE I BETTER HAD GO ON YEAH I'LL GO FOR IT 
I THINK FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
I THINK IT'S MUCH LESS THAN THAT SO I WILL SAY THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND RIGHT WELL 
I'M GLAD TO SAY THAT YOUR GOOD SISTER CATHY HAS DONE HER RESEARCH SO SHE'S RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG 
BUT THIS PROPERTY IS ON THE MARKET AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY 
SO YOU ARE TEN OUT NOT TOO BAD YOU ARE ROUND THE RIGHT BALLPARK 
YEP WE ARE OFF TO MY PROPERTY PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
LIKE TO FOLLOW ME GUYS OF COURSE 
NOW I'VE GONE FOR A TOWN LOCATION FOR MY SUGGESTION 
SITUATED IN THE BUSTLING HUB OF FROME 
THIS HOUSE IS CLOSE TO TOURIST ATTRACTIONS AND A TRAIN LINK TO PADDINGTON AND WATERLOO 
IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL VICTORIAN SEMI WITH MODERN AND SUMPTUOUS INTERIORS 
IT'S GOT FIVE BEDROOMS AND A CONTEMPORARY LUXURY BATHROOM 
IT OOZES GLAMOUR AND ROMANCE OH YEAH BUT WILL CATHY FALL IN LOVE WITH IT 
SO CATHY AND PAUL WELCOME TO PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
NOW THIS IS A LATE VICTORIAN PROPERTY AND FROM THE OUTSIDE 
TO ME IT LOOKS DECEIVING COS I KNOW WHAT'S INSIDE 
AND CAN I JUST SAY OUT OF ALL THE PROPERTIES WE'VE SEEN 
ON THIS LONG OLD HAUL CALLED TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED 
THE SPEC IS FANTASTIC THE QUALITY IS BEAUTIFUL 
AND I AM GENUINELY BUBBLING INSIDE BECAUSE I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE IT 
JENNY IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT INSIDE IT IS SPOT ON IT IS BEAUTIFUL 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE FIRST IMPRESSION OF LOCATION AND THE HOUSE ITSELF 
THE ROAD IMMEDIATELY 
WHAT ROAD HOLD ON A MINUTE 
BECAUSE THAT TO ME JUST MEANS 
PASSING TRADE TOOK THE WORDS OUT OF MY MOUTH 
CATHY WHAT IS YOUR FEELING ABOUT THE PLACE 
YEAH I'M GOING TO BE CONVINCED I THINK MAYBE FROM WHAT YOU'VE SAID 
O. K. NOT PRETTY FROM THE OUTSIDE 
NO WELL ANYWAY I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU GOT IN THERE AND SAW THE BEAUTY THAT IS PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
I'M SORRY BUT IT IS IT IS BEAUTIFUL OFF YOU GO AND ENJOY IT 
ALL RIGHT SEE YOU IN A WHILE 
THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM IN FROME ISN'T THERE BALLABOOM BALLABOOM 
O. K. JENNY LET'S SEE IF CATHY WILL SETTLE FOR A ROOM IN FROME 
WOW THIS IS QUITE AN ENTRANCE THIS GREAT BIG OLD BANISTER RAIL THAT'S RATHER LOVELY 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS PLACE IS IT IS CONTEMPORARY 
HOWEVER ALL THE ORIGINAL FEATURES HAVE BEEN KEPT 
WOW RATHER SPLENDID ISN'T IT LOOK AT THIS TABLE 
THAT IS THE SORT OF STYLE THAT I'M HOPING TO ACHIEVE WITH MINE 
IT'S EVEN BEEN DONE UP JUST THE WAY SHE'D LIKE IT AND IT JUST REALLY DOES HELP DOESN'T IT YEP 
LOOK AT THE VICTORIAN FIREPLACE FANTASTIC IT'S EVEN GOT DUCKS THERE FOR YOU 
IT HAS INDEED WELCOMING DUCKS 
MUST BE THE PLACE I LOVE THESE TILES 
IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE 
FUNNY THING ABOUT TILES IS YOU'VE GOT TO TOUCH THEM 
JUST TO FEEL WHAT THE TEXTURE'S LIKE THE FINISH YES JENNY 
NOW THIS IS THE SORT OF KITCHEN I WAS THINKING OF CAN YOU SEE WHY 
OH YES SUPER I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A KITCHEN WITH AN ISLAND IN IT MYSELF 
THAT'S RIGHT AND THE RANGE 
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE THIS HOUSE I HAVE TO SAY HAVE NOT CUT CORNERS ANYWHERE HAVE THEY 
LOOKING AROUND THERE'S NO LITTLE SHORTCUTS BEEN TAKEN ANYWHERE NO 
YES I COULD IMAGINE MYSELF STANDING HERE DOING ALL MY THINGS I NEED TO DO 
AND THEN ON INTO THE GAMES ROOM 
WOW I DIDN'T REMEMBER ASKING FOR A GAMES ROOM 
OH YOU SEE WELL JENNY JUST THOUGHT SHE'D THROW ONE IN 
YOU ASK FOR THE PERFECT PROPERTY I GIVE YOU THAT AND A LITTLE BIT MORE 
JUST THINK OF THIS FOR THE GALLERY THOUGH 
THINK OF YOUR PICTURES IN HERE 
OH YES IF WE CAN GET PEOPLE IN HERE 
YES GET THEM THROUGH THE HOUSE SOMEHOW THAT'S TRUE 
SHE DOESN'T REALISE THAT WE HAVE A PLACE FOR THE GALLERY 
I DO LIKE THIS WALLPAPER YOU KNOW 
I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL MYSELF 
YOU DON'T LIKE IT WHY NOT I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST TOO 
BEAUTIFUL OLD FASHIONED FOR ME 
THIS IS CONTEMPORARY THIS IS WHAT IT SHOULD BE NOW THIS IS THE STYLE 
EDUCATING PAUL THERE PAUL COME ON 
SHE'S RIGHT IT IS A CONTEMPORARY TAKE ON A VERY CLASSIC DESIGN 
WHICH IS WHY IT FITS IN SO WELL WITH THIS PARTICULAR HOUSE 
AH NOW WE'RE TALKING LOOK AT THAT BATH 
THAT IS THE SORT OF BATH THAT I'VE GOT TO HAVE 
IT'S FANTASTIC AND THE SPACE IN HERE 
THEY'VE GOT THE ROOM TO HAVE ROOM IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
IT'S THAT BATHROOM IS ACTUALLY JUST HUGE BECAUSE IT CAN BE 
IT'S OPULENT ISN'T IT 
THAT IS THE SORT OF BATH THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE IN MY BED AND BREAKFAST 
PROBABLY TAKE HALF AN HOUR TO FILL WELL NO IT WOULDN'T TAKE THAT LONG 
IT'S LUXURY THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED A DEEP BATH 
THIS IS A GOOD ROOM 
YES THIS IS THE SORT OF ROOM THAT I CAN IMAGINE SOMEONE BEING QUITE HAPPY TO COME AND STAY IN 
WITH THE LUXURY OF THIS HOUSE YOU'RE SPOILING US 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE 
COMPLEMENTARY CHOCOLATES 
NOW THIS IS A GOOD SIZE 
AND I LIKE THE LEATHER BED 
DID CATH THE LITTLE MINX JUST SAY I LIKE THE LEATHER BED 
AND I DO LIKE THE SASH WINDOWS THAT THEY HAVE I HOPE THEY ARE WORKING 
YES BUT THERE IS STILL A FAIR AMOUNT OF NOISE COMING OFF THIS ROAD TO THE FRONT YEAH 
I SUPPOSE THAT IS LESS THAN ROMANTIC ROAD NOISE 
OH DOOM AND GLOOM PAUL DOOM AND GLOOM 
NOW A THIRD LOT OF FLOORS TO EXPLORE 
AND MORE OF THE LOVELY LOVELY CARPET 
IT IS THE DEEPEST PILE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED 
AH THE BLUE ROOM 
O. K. UP IN THE SLOPEY ROOF 
YES BUT ALTHOUGH IT'S A SLOPING ROOF 
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S A DARKER COLOUR IT IS STILL QUITE SPACIOUS 
IT DOESN'T FEEL TOO SMALL 
BUT FROM B. AND AMP B. PERSPECTIVE I ALWAYS THINK IT IS QUITE GOOD 
IF YOU CAN SEPARATE WHERE YOU STAY FROM WHERE THE GUESTS STAY 
SO IF YOU USE THE FIRST FLOOR AS THE GUEST ROOM AND KEEP THIS SPACE FOR YOURSELF 
THAT'S TRUE THAT'LL BE QUITE NICE I THINK I COULD BE QUITE HAPPY IF THIS WAS MY ROOM 
I WONDER WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO GO JENNY'S DONE VERY WELL 
OH THIS IS RATHER UNEXPECTED BUT IT IS THE OLD CINEMA ROOM LOOK AT THAT 
CATHY BOYS TOYS' ROOM INNIT IF YOU'VE GOT A SPARE ROOM YOU TURN IT INTO YOUR CINEMA ROOM 
NO YOU DON'T YOU TURN IT BACK INTO A BEDROOM 
SO OVERALL APART FROM THE FACT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH EN SUITE BATHROOMS IT IS WELL THOUGHT OUT 
AND A LOVELY STANDARD 
OH NO WHAT 
HEADMISTRESS WANTS TO SEE US IN THE OFFICE 
NOW MADAM I BROUGHT YOU TO THE TOP OF THE HOUSE 
NOW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE LOOKED INTO THE WHOLE FIRE REGULATIONS 
AND HEALTH AND SAFETY ASPECTS OF RUNNING A B. AND AMP B. A LITTLE 
AS SOON AS YOU GET UP THIS HIGH IN A HOUSE EXACTLY ON THIS FLOOR YES 
YOU HAVE TO START OFFERING YOUR GUESTS A FIRE ESCAPE RIGHT 
ALL YOUR DOORS MUST BE FIRE DOORS 
AND I'M WORRIED LOOKING AT THESE BEAUTIFUL SOLID OAK DOORS 
THAT THEY'VE PUT IN HERE THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE THICK ENOUGH TO CONSTITUTE FIRE DOORS O. K. 
BUT IF THEY ARE ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS PUT DOOR CLOSERS ON THEM 
DRILL A HOLE IN HERE DRILL A HOLE IN THERE 
AND THE DOOR CLOSES WHEN NOBODY'S IN THE ROOM YES 
THAT COULD REALLY ADD TO THE COST OF THE PLACE COULDN'T IT 
IT COULD TALKING OF COST JENNY DID WELL SHE DID 
BEAUTIFUL HOUSE IT IS BUT LET'S SEE WHAT VROOM VROOM YOU GET FOR YOUR MONEY IN FROME 
O. K. LET'S GUESS THE PRICE LET'S GO 
NOW PAUL JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU'D SEEN IT ALL I COME AND GIVE YOU ANOTHER BONUS 
I NOTICED YOU SAID THE GALLERY COULD BE AT THE END OF THE KITCHEN 
THAT'S RIGHT BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO TRUDGE THROUGH THE HOUSE TO COME AND HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR WORK YEP 
HERE WE HAVE CAR PARKING SPACES FOR AT LEAST FIVE VEHICLES 
AT THE BACK AND AN ENTRANCE INTO THIS END OF THE GARDEN 
YEP SO PEOPLE COULD COME IN YOU'VE GOT ROOM FOR A GALLERY AND MORE 
VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE BUILDING THIS ON ITS OWN ISN'T IT YEAH 
YES DEFINITELY HUGE POTENTIAL WITH LOCAL AUTHORITY CONSENT OF COURSE 
YOU'RE LEARNING I TOLD YOU THAT ON THE OTHER ONE DIDN'T I YEP 
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL HAVE A BETTER CLUE AT GUESS THE PRICE I DOUBT IT 
LET'S SEE SHALL WE FIND THE OTHERS 
O. K. O. K. 
O. K. ALL READY AND RARING FOR GUESS THE PRICE YEP WE ARE 
GOOD STUFF NOT SO GOOD FOR YOU THOUGH BECAUSE THE PRESSURE IS ON 
BECAUSE IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY YOU DID ABYSMALLY LAST TIME 
I'M AFRAID I DID YEP SO NOW'S YOUR CHANCE 
O. K. TO REDEEM YOURSELF YEP 
O. K. WELL LET'S REMIND OURSELVES THE BUDGET WAS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND IT'S YOUR GO 
O. K. WELL THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE FINISH IN THERE 
SO BUT I'M GOING TO PLUMP FOR FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
O. K. O. K. SIS WHAT DO YOU THINK 
BIT MORE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY 
ALL RIGHT THEN JENNY 
PAUL WHAT CAN I DO BUT 
YOU'VE DONE IT YOU'VE DONE IT 
IT WAS WORTH IT FOR THE KISS AHH THE ASKING PRICE IS FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY 
SO THAT'S EVEN BETTER IT IS GOOD THAT DOES SEEM LIKE GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY IT DOES 
IT'S TO DO WITH THE LOCATION HAS THAT SWUNG IT FOR YOU 
DON'T TELL US YET BECAUSE NOW WE ARE GOING TO A LESSON WHERE ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN 
NOT BECAUSE IT'S BEING TAUGHT BY JENNY BUT BECAUSE IT'S THE WILD CARD 
AND THE WILD CARD MY FRIENDS IS THIS WAY SO COME ON MIGHT GET ANOTHER KISS 
NOW A WORD OR TWO OF WARNING 
YOU MAY NEED YOUR WELLIES AND A CAR IF YOU STAY AT THE WILD CARD 
SITUATED NEAR HOLCOMBE IT'S A RANCH STYLE HOUSE WITH CONTEMPORARY INTERIORS 
IT'S GOT FIVE DOUBLE BEDROOMS FOUR EN SUITE A SEPARATE LOUNGE FOR GUESTS 
AND ENOUGH WHITE WALLS FOR JOHN TO EXHIBIT HIS PHOTOGRAPHS 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE PERFECT WEEKEND HIDEAWAY BUT WILL CATHY BE DRAWN TO LIVING IN THE STICKS 
WE ARE ABOUT TO FIND OUT JENNY WE'VE GIVEN HER TOWN NOW WE'RE GIVING HER COUNTRY 
O. K. CATHY AND PAUL VERY EXCITED IT'S THE WILD CARD 
WE'VE BROUGHT YOU DOWN THIS RATHER LOVELY COUNTRY ROAD BECAUSE WE CAN 
UNLIKE PROPERTY TWO WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE 
AND WE THINK THIS HOUSE IS GOING TO WORK WELL 
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT 
THAT'S THE ROMANTIC COUPLES AWAY FOR A QUIET WEEKEND 
IT'S A WILD CARD BECAUSE WE ARE OUT IN THE WILDS AS YOU CAN APPRECIATE 
BUT NONETHELESS LONGLEAT ISN'T TOO FAR AWAY ABOUT SIX MILES OR SO 
YOU'VE GOT A PUB ABOUT TWO MILES DOWN THE ROAD ALWAYS A GOOD THING 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK I THINK IT LOOKS FANTASTIC 
WHAT ABOUT YOU PAUL 
LOOK'S LIKE AN INTERESTING MODERN DEVELOPMENT SO REALLY KEEN TO GET IN THERE 
SO IN YOU GO AND WE WILL TALK TO YOU AFTERWARDS O. K. THANK YOU 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WHY IS IT THAT IF A PUB'S TWO MILES AWAY 
IT SEEMS A LONG WAY ON THE WAY BUT ON THE WAY BACK NO TIME AT ALL IS IT YEAH 
THIS LOOKS PROMISING 
OH I COULD JUST EAT A B. AND AMP B. BREAKFAST A BOWL OF PORRIDGE WHAT WOULD BE YOURS 
A VERY GOOD QUESTION JENNY I THINK I'D HAVE SOME OF YOUR PORRIDGE WITH HONEY AND CINNAMON 
WOW THIS IS NOT REALLY WHAT I EXPECTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRYSIDE 
I DON'T LIKE THE FLOORS THEY ARE NOT THOSE LOVELY OAK FLOORS THAT WE SAW 
NO COMPARISON AT ALL WITH THAT PLACE IN FROME 
WELL SPOTTED 
IT'S SUCH A MODERN FIREPLACE I THINK I WOULD PREFER A REAL FIRE THAN THE PRETEND SORT WHAT IS IT 
IT'S FUNKY AND IT'S COOL AND IT'S CONTEMPORARY 
IF YOU COME AWAY JENNY FOR THE ROMANTIC WEEKEND YOU WANT THE ROARING FIRE DON'T YOU 
WELL YOU WON'T BE IN THAT LIVING ROOM FOR VERY LONG 
YOU'D BE DOWN THE PUB IF YOU'VE COME FOR A ROMANTIC WEEKEND 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE CONTEMPORARY FIRE LET'S HOPE NOT 
YOU'LL BE MAKING YOUR OWN HOT HEAT OH 
GOSH ULTRA MODERN KITCHEN GOSH YES YOU'RE RIGHT 
SHE SAID SHE LIKED MODERN DOES SHE LIKE IT THIS MODERN 
IT'S FANTASTIC BUT IT STILL DOESN'T HAVE THE QUALITY OF THE LAST ONE 
YOU'RE RIGHT WITH MY PROPERTY WE REALLY HAVE SET THE STANDARDS HAVEN'T WE SET THE BAR HIGH 
BACK TO THE ENTRANCE CORRIDOR 
BECAUSE IT'S A BLANK CANVASS PAUL'S PHOTOGRAPHS WOULD LOOK GREAT IN HERE WOULDN'T THEY 
THEY'D JUST SET THEM OFF A TREAT 
LOT OF NATURAL LIGHT BIG WHITE WALLS 
WOW THE FIRST OF THE BEDROOMS 
IT'S LIKE OUT OF A MAGAZINE IT IS 
I THINK THAT'S A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE 
UNLESS IT IS HOMES FROM HELL WEEKLY OR SOMETHING 
YES I MEAN I'M NOT SURE ABOUT HAVING DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOMS 
I'M NOT USED TO IT BUT I GUESS I MIGHT HAVE TO GET USED TO IT 
THIS COULD BE MY ROOM WHICH IS SORT OF NEAR THE KITCHEN 
YES IT SEEMS TO BE RATHER A WASTE OF SPACE IN MY OPINION 
WASTE OF SPACE HE'S SO PRACTICAL SOMETIMES I'LL HAVE TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER KISS 
ANOTHER VERY MODERN BEDROOM IT IS IT HAS THE SAME FEEL AS THE OTHER ONE IT'S NOT THAT DIFFERENT IS IT 
IT'S STILL A SORT OF JAPANESE CLEAN FEEL TO IT 
BUT WE HAVE GOT IN HERE OH A GOOD BATHROOM 
THAT'S QUITE IMPRESSIVE SO IT'S A GOOD ROOM 
IT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN YOU HEAR YOU'VE GOT AN EN SUITE AND YOU'VE ONLY GOT A SHOWER 
GOT A BATH AS WELL BATH AS WELL I LOVE A BATH 
WELL THIS IS SORT OF UNEXPECTED WE ARE IN A LITTLE SORT OF LIVING ROOM 
I'M NOT SURE 
IT'S NOT VERY BIG AND THERE IS ALL THESE DOORS COMING INTO IT 
THAT'S WHAT IT IS A ROOM OF DOORS 
YOU COULD HAVE A FEW MAGAZINES THERE BIT OF FRUIT FEW LITTLE NIBBLES 
SO THAT IF ANYONE WAS A BIT PECKISH AND IT WASN'T YET MEAL TIME 
I SAY TO YOU AT THE MOMENT THOUGH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN DOCTOR'S WAITING ROOM 
ANOTHER PROPER SIZE DOUBLE ROOM 
YES I THINK THE WHOLE THING WITH THIS HOUSE 
IS IT FEELS COLD BECAUSE OF THE WHITENESS AND THE PALENESS 
YOU SAID THAT DIDN'T YOU NEEDS JUST A SPLASH OF COLOUR SPLASH OF COLOUR 
IT NEEDS TO HAVE SOME WARMER COLOURS 
IT WOULD BE A MESS IF YOU JUST GOT A CAN AND SPLASHED IT ON THE WALL 
NOW YOU ARE BEING SILLY I'M NOT YOU GOT TO GET A ROLLER 
YEAH AND A FEW LUXURIOUS SOME FUR FABRIC OR SOMETHING TO ADD A BIT OF WARMTH TO IT 
LIKE A BIT OF FUR DO YOU CATH YEAH NEEDS WARMING UP PURRR 
OH NICE STUDY OR LIBRARY 
I LIKE ALL THE BOOKSHELVES 
YES THE DOOR'S A NICE FEATURE MAKES IT A NICE ROOM 
AND WHAT WOULD I USE IT FOR WELL MY OFFICE I GUESS 
IT'S AMAZING ISN'T IT FEW BOOKS ON A BOOKSHELF AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE PLACE HAS GOT A HEART 
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE USEFUL YEP 
CATH AND PAUL ARE GOING TO BE CONFUSED WHEN THEY COME OUT 
OF THIS PROPERTY BECAUSE YOU DON'T WALK IN THERE AND GET 
YOU DON'T GO POW THIS IS IT 
NO YOU DON'T GET AN AMAZING FEEL ABOUT IT 
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
THERE IS BECAUSE IT IS DIFFERENT 
IT'S NOT YOUR STANDARD TWO UP TWO DOWN PLACE 
IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND IT NEEDS NEEDS A BIT OF OOMPH INJECTED INTO IT DOESN'T IT 
IF ONLY THEY COULD BOTTLE OOMPH OOMPH 
AND THERE IS ANOTHER BEDROOM AND 
ANOTHER EN SUITE 
THIS HOUSE DOESN'T NEED ANY OOMPH 
IT REALLY POPS MY CORK IT MAKES ME BUBBLE INSIDE 
COMPLEMENTARY CHAMPAGNE 
IT'S ONLY A SINGLE ROOM ISN'T IT 
I DON'T THINK WE COULD GET EASILY A DOUBLE BED IN HERE I'M NOT SURE 
THE BEDROOM'S A BIT SMALL FOR A DOUBLE BED 
WELL JUST CLOSE THE DOOR LOCK IT THROW AWAY THE KEY 
THERE ARE OTHER BEDROOMS DOES IT MATTER 
THE WHOLE HOUSE FEELS COLD 
BUT A FANTASTIC BLANK CANVAS TO DO THINGS WITH O. K. I COULD REALLY ENJOY IT 
IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT'S GOT A GOOD FEEL TO IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S A BIT COLD AT THE MOMENT 
WELL JEN THEY ARE IN THERE SOMEWHERE 
LUCKY THEY ARE NOT WEARING WHITE WE'D NEVER FIND THEM 
SO WHAT DO WE THINK OF THIS AREA THE KITCHEN AND THE DINING ROOM 
WELL IT WOULDN'T WORK FOR THE BED AND BREAKFAST NO 
I'D NEED TO CHANGE IT IN SOME WAY 
IT'S NOT GOT THAT QUALITY THAT I'D LIKE AND IT JUST ISN'T A USEABLE SPACE FOR GUESTS 
SO BIT IMPRACTICAL BUT DEPENDING ON BUDGET SOMETHING YOU COULD OBVIOUSLY CHANGE 
YOU'VE GOT THE SPACE TO RECONFIGURE DEFINITELY THAT'S RIGHT 
I WAS THINKING POSSIBLY SOME KIND OF SCREEN 
THAT MAYBE WITH FOLDING DOORS THAT YOU COULD FOLD BACK WHEN BREAKFAST WAS READY 
YES THAT MIGHT WORK YEAH 
THE OTHER THING IS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO REGISTER AS A FOOD BUSINESS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH 
AND THEY'D GIVE YOU A FOOD SAFETY PACK 
THAT WOULD GIVE YOU ALL THE CODES OF PRACTICE WHEN IT COMES TO HYGIENE 
NOW WE ARE UP FOR ONE MORE THING IF YOU CAN MANAGE IT AND THAT IS 
GUESS THE PRICE AND THIS IS THE DECIDER IT IS 
PRESSURE'S ON IT IS SHALL WE GO AND FIND THEM PLEASE DO 
HELLO HELLO YOU READY 
YES WE'RE READY IN FACT WE HAVEN'T LIMBERED UP YET 
BECAUSE THIS IS THE DECIDER 
ONE ALL KIDS ONE ALL 
BROTHER AND SISTER FIGHTING IT OUT 
WILL THIS BE A DIFFICULT ONE TO WORK OUT HESITATE TO SAY 
I HAD TO SAY I DON'T MEAN TO BUST YOU HERE PAUL SAID THIS ONE'S EASY

WHY IS IT EASY WELL WE'LL FIND OUT NOW THEN

SO IT'S RIGHT AT THE TOP OF YOUR BUDGET 
SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO LOVE IT TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS ONE 
AND THIS IS WHERE OF COURSE A DECISION HAS TO BE MADE 
OR VERY SOON ANYWAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO DECIDE OUT OF THE THREE PROPERTIES WE'VE SHOWN YOU 
WHICH ONE YOU'RE GOING TO TEST DRIVE

BUT A COUPLE OF THEM YOU QUITE LIKE

BUT WILL THIS CONVERTED SCHOOLHOUSE COME TOP OF CATHY'S CLASS 
THE INTERIORS WEREN'T QUITE UP TO HER STANDARDS 
BUT AT FIFTY K. SHORT OF HER BUDGET 
IT MIGHT JUST MAKE THE GRADE AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
OR WILL SHE PLUMP FOR THE VICTORIAN TOWNHOUSE WITH ITS SUMPTUOUS DECOR 
IT ALREADY HAS THAT LUXURIOUS FEEL THAT CATHY'S AFTER IN HER B. AND AMP B. 
IT'S THE LEAST EXPENSIVE 
BUT EVEN SO DOES SHE LOVE IT ENOUGH TO SHELL OUT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
THEN FINALLY THERE WAS OUR WILD CARD 
THIS RANCH STYLE HOUSE HAS ENOUGH BEDROOMS AND EN SUITES READY AND WAITING 
FOR CATH'S PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS 
BUT IT'S AT THE TOP OF HER BUDGET 
AS THE HOUSE IS PRICED AT FOUR HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
SO CATHY PAUL I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT OF COURSE YOU WENT FOR THE SPARKLY CHANDELIER JOBBY

THERE IS A CRACK IN THE FRAME OF THE STONEWORK 
IN THE BAY WINDOW IT'S NOT A BAD THING
