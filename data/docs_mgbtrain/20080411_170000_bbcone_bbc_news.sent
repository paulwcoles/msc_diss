AFTER LAST MONTH'S CHAOS B. A. HAS HAD 
TO PUT OFF THE TRANSFER OF LONG 
HAUL FLIGHTS THERE 
AND TWO WEEKS AFTER MY BAG WENT 
MISSING FROM TERMINAL FIVE I RETURN TO 
HEATHROW TO TRY AND TRACK IT DOWN 
ALSO ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME THE 
GLASGOW AIRPORT ATTACK THE 
BOMBER'S BROTHER IS CONVICTED FOR 
NOT TELLING POLICE WHAT HE KNEW 
PREMATURE BABIES WE HAVE WE HAVE 
AN EXCLUSIVE REPORT ON VITAL 
RESEARCH WHICH COULD INFLUENCE THE 
DEBATE ON ABORTION 
AND PRINCE WILLIAM GETS HIS WINGS 
HIS FATHER PRESENTS THEM WHILE HIS 
GIRLFRIEND LOOKS ON 
ON B. B. C. LONDON NEWS THE CHILDHOOD 
FRIEND OF MISSING T. V. PRESENTER MARK 
SPEIGHT APPEALS FOR HELP IN FINDING 
HIM AND WHY N. H. S. DENTISTS ARE 
REFUSING HELP TO THOSE MOST IN NEED 
GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE SIX O'CLOCK 
NEWS IT'S TWO WEEKS NOW SINCE 
HEATHROW'S TERMINAL FIVE OPENED TO 
CHAOTIC SCENES OF CANCELLED FLIGHTS 
AND LOST BAGGAGE TODAY IN 
YESTERDAY ANOTHER EMBARRASSING 
SETBACK BRITISH AIRWAYS ANNOUNCED 
IT WAS POSTPONING THE TRANSFER OF 
LONG HAUL FLIGHTS TO THE TERMINAL 
UNTIL JUNE THERE'S BEEN A FURIOUS 
REACTION FROM SOME OF B. A.'S RIVALS 
B. M. I. WHICH WILL NOW HAVE TO DELAY 
MOVES OF ITS OWN SAID IT WAS 
OUTRAGEOUS AND INCONSIDERATE AND 
MADE THE UKA LAUGHING STOCK OUR 
TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT TOM SYMONDS 
HAS MORE 
APRIL THIRTIETH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 
FINAL PHASE OF THE BIG MOVE TO 
TERMINAL FIVE BUT NOW IT'S ABOUT TURN 
AND BACK TO TERMINAL FOUR AT LEAST 
FOR THE TIME BEING WHY WELL ON 
T. FIVE'S BLACK THURSDAY TWO WEEKS AGO 
THE TERMINAL WAS ACTUALLY ONLY HALF 
FULL OF PASSENGERS AND BAGS AND 
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED 
IT'S NOT MY 
FAULT THEY SEE 
LITTLE WONDER 
THE AIRPORT AND THE B. A. BOSS HAVE 
DECIDED TO TAKE A PAUSE FOR BREATH 
WHAT WE HAVE DECIDED TO DO IS TO 
USE THIS GAP USE THE DELAY TO 
ALLOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT YET 
WORKED IN T. FIVE THE BENEFIT OF WORKING 
SIDE BY SIDE WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
WORKED THERE SO THEY CAN LEARN FROM 
THEIR EXPERIENCE OF ACTUALLY 
WORKING IN T. FIVE 
ON DAY ONE TERMINAL FIVE HANDLED MORE 
THAN THAN THREE HUNDRED NINETY FLIGHTS PHASE TWO 
WOULD HAVE INVOLVED ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
LONG HAUL FLIGHTS BECAUSE THE 
PLANES ARE BIGGER IT WOULD HAVE 
DOUBLED THE PRESSURE ON THE 
TERMINAL TERMINAL THE MOVE IS NOW DELAYED TO JUNE 
THOUGH B. A. HASN'T YET CONFIRMED AN 
EXACT DATE AND THAT HAS A KNOCK ON 
EFFECT BECAUSE THIRTY OTHER AIRLINES 
ARE DUE TO MOVE INTO TERMINAL FOUR 
ONCE B. A. HAS LEFT SOME SAID THEY 
WERE DISAPPOINTED B. A.'S COMPETITOR 
B. M. I. WAS DOWNRIGHT FURIOUS THERE'S THERE'S BEEN A LONG PERIOD OF CONSULTATION 
OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS TO 
CHOREOGRAPH ALL THE AIRLINE MOVES 
OVER FIFTY AIRLINES OVER HEATHROW AT 
THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND THAT'S BEEN 
DISREGARDED IN ONE UNILATERAL 
DECISION BY BRITISH AIRWAYS AND B. A. A. 
B. A. CAN'T AFFORD MORE DISRUPTION 
IT'S STILL TRYING TO CLEAR THE BAGS 
SEPARATED FROM THEIR OWNERS BY T. FIVE'S 
BAGGAGE LOGJAM AT THE HEIGHT OF 
THE CRISIS THERE WERE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND LOST 
BAGS NOW THAT'S DOWN TO FIVE THOUSAND 
PILED UP NOT NOW AT HEATHROW BUT 
AT OTHER AIRPORTS INCLUDING TWO THOUSAND 
AT AN ITALIAN FACILITY DESTINED FOR 
PASSENGERS OVERSEAS THERE HAVE 
BEEN FEW CANCELLATIONS IN RECENT 
DAYS BUT THERE ARE STILL 
INTERMITTENT PROBLEMS WITH THE 
BAGGAGE SYSTEM AND THIS FORMER 
MANAGER SAYS THE STAFF ARE FEELING 
BATTERED AND BRUISED 
THEY'VE TAKEN 
A LOT OF STICK FROM THE PROBLEMS 
ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT THE PASSENGERS' 
FAULT THE PASSENGERS WILL CLEARLY 
TAKE IT OUT ON THEM L. THINK THEY 
WERE LOOKING FOR LEADERSHIP AT THE 
BEGINNING OF TERMINAL FIVE MANY FEEL 
AT THE MOMENT THEY DIDN'T GET THAT 
B. A.'S NOW CONSIDERING A PHASED 
INTRODUCTION OF THE REST OF ITS 
FLIGHTS TO ITS TROUBLESOME TERMINAL 
SOME WILL ARGUE THAT SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN THE PLAN ALL ALONG 
LET'S TALK TO TOM NOW FROM OUTSIDE 
HEATHROW AS WE WERE HEARING THERE 
B. A. HAS UPSET PASSENGERS IT HAS 
CERTAINLY UPSET OTHER AIR LINES 
HOW DAMAGING IS IT FOR THEM IT'S IT'S AMAZING THIS ONE DECISION ABOUT 
TERMINAL FOUR ACTUALLY AFFECTS THE 
WHOLE OF THE AIRPORT WHEN TERMINAL 
FOUR IS EMPTY AND B. A. HAS MOVED TO 
TERMINAL FIVE AND AIR LINES WILL MOVE 
FROM TERMINAL TWO TO FOUR TERMINAL TWO 
WILL BE REBUILT ALONG WITH TERMINAL 
ONE AND THAT AFFECTS AIRLINES IN 
TERMINAL ONE INCLUDING B. M. I. THEY'RE 
NOT HAPPY THEY DON'T LIKE THE IDEA 
OF B. A. HAVING TERMINAL FIVE IN THE 
FIRST PLACE THEY SEE IT AS A BIT 
LIKE A SPOILT CHILD SQUANDERING A 
NICE PRESENT AND THERE IS ALSO B. A. A. 
THE COMPANY THAT OWNS THE AIRPORT E. 
THAT'S NOT VERY POPULAR BECAUSE 
IT'S GOT A MONOPOLY OVER THE BIG 
LONDON AIRPORTS SO A LOT OF ROWING 
GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES AS FOR 
PASSENGERS THEY'VE GAINED LITTLE 
OUT OF TERMINAL FIVE SO FAR CERTAINLY 
NOT THE GRAND PROMISES THEY WERE 
OFFERED BEFORE IT OPENED THEY WANT 
TO SEE IT GET TO NORMAL L. DON'T 
THINK THEY ARE GOING TO DESERT B. A. 
IN DROVES BUT T. H. R. GOING THEY ARE 
GOING TO WANT TO SEE RESULTS 
A LOT 
OF PASSENGERS STILL WANT THEIR BAGS 
BACK LATER WE WILL BE TRYING TO 
REUNITE REPORTER WITH A BAG SHE 
LOST AT TERMINAL FIVE TWO WEEKS AGO 
THE BROTHER OF THE MAN WHO TRIED TO 
BLOW UP GLASGOW AIRPORT HAS BEEN 
SENTENCED TO EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN JAIL 
FOR WITHHOLDING INFORMATION ABOUT 
THE PLOT SABEEL AHMED SAW AN 
INCRIMINATING E. MAIL FROM HIS 
BROTHER KAFEEL AFTER THE ATTACK BUT 
FAILED TO TELL THE POLICE DANIEL 
SAND SAND SAND SANDFORD JOINS 
US FROM 
TWO MEN ARE DUE TO GO ON 
TRIAL IN THE ATTACKS LAST SUMMER 
BUT TODAY A THIRD MAN PLEADED 
GUILTY HE IS SABEEL AHMED AN N. H. S. 
DOCTOR AND THE BROTHER OF KAFEEL 
THE MAN WHO DIED AFTER SETTING 
HIMSELF ON FIRE AT GLASGOW AIRPORT 
IT WAS THE HEADLINE TERRORIST 
ATTACK OF LAST SUMMER GLASGOW 
AIRPORT RAMMED BY A BURNING CAR 
TODAY WE LEARNED THAT THE MAN AT 
THE WHEEL KAFEEL AHMED HAD 
REPEATEDLY TRIED TO GET THE VEHICLE 
INTO THE TERMINAL WITH QUEUEING 
PASSENGERS JUST JUST TWENTY FEET AWAY 
THE PREVIOUS DAY HE HAD BEEN PART 
OF AN ATTEMPTED ATTACK ON THE TIGER 
TIGER CLUB IN LONDON THERE WERE 
MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED CUSTOMERS IN THE 
NIGHTCLUB BUT THE BOMB CAR FULL 
OF PETROL AND GAS CYLINDERS DIDN'T 
EXPLODE EXPLODE AND WE NOW KNOW WHAT POLICE BELIEVE 
IS THE REASON FOR THE CAR BOMB 
FAILING TO GO OFF THERE HAD BEEN A 
DETONATION FROM THE MOBILE PHONE 
TRIGGER BUT THE MIXTURE OF FUEL 
VAPOUR AND AIR INSIDE THE CAR 
DIDN'T IGNITE PROBABLY BECAUSE 
THERE WAS TOO MUCH FUEL VAPOUR AND 
NOT ENOUGH AIR TODAY KAFEEL'S 
BROTHER SABEEL AHMED PLEADED 
GUILTY TO FAILING TO TELL THE WHAT 
HE KNEW ABOUT THE ATTACKS 
INFORMATION CONTAINED IN AN E. MAIL 
KAFEEL HAD WRITTEN IT THAT MORNING 
HE TRIED TO BOMB TIGER TIGER IN THE 
EARLY HOURS OF FRIDAY THE NEXT DAY 
HE TEXTED SABEEL TO READ THE NOTE 
AND HALF AN HOUR LATER ATTACKED 
GLASGOW AIRPORT SABEEL OPENED THE 
E. MAIL AT FORTY TWO TWO HUNDRED P. M. THAT AFTERNOON 
IN IT HIS BROTHER HAD WRITTEN 
WHEN SABEEL WAS ARRESTED THAT'S 
EXACTLY WHAT HE TOLD POLICE IN 
INTERVIEWS THAT HIS BROTHER WAS 
DOING A GLOBAL WARMING PROJECT IN 
ICELAND NOT DYING FROM SELF 
INFLICTED BURNS IN A GLASGOW 
HOSPITAL HOSPITAL TODAY THE PROSECUTION ALSO SAID 
THAT WHEN POLICE SEARCHED THIS 
HOUSE NEAR GLASGOW AIRPORT THEY 
FOUND ENOUGH EQUIPMENT TO HAVE 
BUILT THE CAR BOMBS IN GLASGOW AND 
LONDON AND SEVERAL FURTHER DEVICES 
HE WAS SENTENCED TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUT 
BECAUSE OF THE TIME HE HAS SPENT IN 
PRISON HE WILL BE RELEASED ALMOST 
IMMEDIATELY HE HAS AGREED TO BE 
REPATTRIATED TO INDIA WHERE HE 
HOPES TO RESUME HIS CAREER AS A 
DOCTOR DOCTOR NOW IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVER 
STUDIES INTO PREMATURE BIRTHS AND 
IT COULD SHAPE THE CURRENT DEBATE 
ABOUT ABORTION IN BRITAIN THE B. B. C. 
HAS LEARNED THAT A STUDY OF MORE 
THAN ONE THOUSAND BABIES IS INDICATING 
THAT SURVIVAL RATES FOR THOSE BORN 
BEFORE TWENTY FOUR WEEKS HAVE NOT IMPROVED 
IN MORE THAN A DECADE IT COULD 
BOLSTER THE ARGUMENT FOR KEEPING 
THE CURRENT TWENTY FOUR WEEK ABORTION LIMIT 
OUR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT FERGUS 
WALSH HAS THIS EXCLUSIVE REPORT 
THIS BABY WAS BORN AT TWENTY FOUR WEEKS 
WEIGHING LESS THAN TWO L. B. S. BABIES 
LIKE HIM ARE NOW MUCH MORE LIKELY 
TO SURVIVE THAN DECADE AGO I I THINK IT'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS CHANGE 
JUST BECAUSE I CAN HOLD HIM NOW 
AND FEED HIM AND WATCH HOW HE IS 
GROWING AND HE IS KICKING AROUND 
IT'S VERY GREAT 
THIS DOCTOR TRIES TO KEEP BABIES 
ALIVE BORN BELOW TWENTY FOUR WEEKS THE 
CURRENT CUTOFF FOR ABORTION BUT 
SAYS SURVIVAL HAS NOT IMPROVED IN 
THIS GROUP 
THERE HAS BEEN A 
STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE 
IN SURVIVAL AT TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY FIVE WEEKS BUT 
NOT AT TWENTY THREE WEEKS 
THE STUDY SHOWS 
THAT FORTY PER CENT OF BABIES BORN AT TWENTY THREE WEEKS 
JUST BEFORE THE CUTOFF FOR ABORTION 
DIE ON THE LABOUR WARD OF THOSE 
WHO LIVE TWENTY SIX PER CENT SURVIVE HOSPITAL 
LITTLE IMPROVEMENT ON A DECADE AGO 
AT TWENTY FOUR WEEKS FORTY SEVEN PER CENT SURVIVE AND AT TWENTY FIVE 
WEEKS SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT SURVIVE 
PRO CHOICE GROUPS SAY THIS SURVIVAL 
DATA SUPPORTS THEIR ARGUMENT THAT 
THE ABORTION TIME LIMIT SHOULD NOT 
BE LOWERED 
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY 
PEOPLE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THE 
IDEA OF ALLOWING ABORTIONSION THE 
AGE OF LIABILITY I THINK IT'S 
INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT THAT THE 
SCIENCE SUPPORTS THE TWENTY FOUR WEEK LIMIT 
MEDICAL IMAGING CAN SHOW FETAL 
DEVELOPMENT IN MORE DETAIL THAN 
EVER M. P.'S WHO WANT TO CUT ABORTION 
TO TWENTY WEEKS SAY TECHNOLOGY IS 
HELPING 
MORE BABIES LIVE CERTAINLY CERTAINLY MORE BABIES SURVIVE UNDER TWENTY FOUR WEEKS 
WHEN WHEN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD 
CARE AND WE KNOW FROM THE POINT OF 
FETAL PAIN THAT BABIES FEEL PAIN 
PROBABLY FROM AROUND SIXTEEN WEEKS 
ONWARDS AND THEREFORE BECAUSE OF 
SREUABILITY ISSUE ISSUES WE THINK 
IT'S APPROPRIATE THE LIMIT IS 
BROUGHT DOWN 
EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO 
PARLIAMENT REDUCED THE ABORTION 
TIME LIMIT FROM TWENTY EIGHT TO TWENTY FOUR WEEKS 
AFTER EVIDENCE FROM DOCTORS THAT 
THERE HAD BEEN SIGNIFICANT 
IMPROVEMENTS IN EARLY FETAL 
SREUABILITY NOW THIS RESEARCH 
SUGGESTS THERE'S BEEN NO MAJOR 
PROGRESS SINCE THEN BELOW TWENTY FOUR WEEKS 
GESTATION THAT MAY BE ENOUGH ON A 
FREE VOTE TO PERSUADE MANY M. P.'S TO 
LEAVE THE CURRENT ABORTION TIME 
LIMIT UNCHANGED 
SENDING BRITISH SOLDIERS INTO 
BATTLE WITH DEFECTIVE EQUIPMENT 
COULD BREACH THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS A 
HIGH COURT JUDGE RULED TODAY HE 
ALSO REJECTED A GOVERNMENT ATTEMPT 
TO BAN CORONERS FROM CRITICISING 
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE FRANK 
GARDNER HAS THE DETAILS 
BRITISH TROOPS ON OPERATIONS ARE IN 
HARM'S WAY ALMOST EVERY DAY UNTIL 
NOW THE MOD HAS DEFENDED ITSELF 
FROM LAW SUITS BY MAINTAINING THAT 
SOLDIERS OPERATING OUTSIDE BRITAIN 
WERE NOT GENERALLY COVERED BY THE 
HUMAN RIGHTS ACT BUT TODAY A HIGH 
COURT JUDGE RULED THAT A SOLDIER 
SHOULD NOT LOSE ALL PROTECTION 
SIMPLY BECAUSE HE IS IN HOSTILE 
TERRITORY HE SAID 
WHEN AN R. A. F. HERCULES LIKE THIS ONE 
WAS SHOT DOWN IN IRAQ THREE YEARS 
AGO KILLING TEN SEFRMEN ON 
SERVICEMEN THE INQUEST ASKED COULD 
THOSE DEATHS HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF 
THE PLANES HAD BEEN FITTED WITH 
EXPLOSIVE SUPPRESSANT FOAM THEY 
HAVE BEEN SINCE A LAWYER FAMILIAR 
WITH THAT CASE BELIEVES THE HIGH 
COURT RULING HAS NOW CLARIFIED A 
MURKY AREA 
WHAT THIS CASE DOES IS 
NAIL IT DOWN IT MAKES IT VERY 
CLEAR DOES THIS CASE FROM NOW ON 
THAT SOLDIERS OPERATING IN THEATRE 
HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS ANY OTHER 
CITIZEN 
THE MOD IS ON THE CITIZEN DEFENSIVE RULINGS LIKE TODAY'S 
RISK TRIGGERING A FLOOD OF LAW 
SUITS FROM BEREAVED FAMILIES 
CONVINCED THEIR LOVED ONES SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN BETTER PROTECTED THERE THERE HAVE BEEN GREAT IMPROVEMENTS MADE 
IN EQUIPMENT BECAUSE WE FOUND 
OURSELVES ABOUT A FEW YEARS AGO IN 
A VERY DIFFICULT AND CHANGING 
ENVIRONMENT AND WE HAVE PUT A LOT 
OF INVESTMENT INTO THAT AND THEY 
ARE AS WELL EQUIPPED AS ANY TROOPS 
IN THE WORLD NOW SO THIS CRITICISM 
WHICH IS A DATED CRIT SEUFPLT FROM 
A CRITICISM FROM A DIFFERENT TIME 
IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE TROOPS 
THAT ARE PRESENTLY DEPLOYED 
CRITICS OF THE MOD WOULD ARGUE THAT 
MANY OF THOSE IMPROVEMENTS ARE DUE 
TO THE PUBLIC OUTRAGE RAISED BY 
FAMILIES OF THE BEREAVED THEY'RE 
CERTAINLY WELCOMING THIS RULING 
OTHERS THOUGH ARGUE THAT TAKEN TO 
EXTREMES CONCERNS OVER SOLDIERS' 
HUMAN RIGHTS COULD END UP 
JEOPARDISING ENTIRE MILITARY 
OPERATIONS TAKE NATO FORCES IN 
AFGHANISTAN FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE 
GERMANS WON'T FLY AT NIGHT AND 
SOME SOME NATIONS ARE AVOIDING 
COMBAT ALTOGETHER BRITISH FORCES 
DON'T MIND THE ACTION BUT IF BETTER 
KIT CAN SAVE LIVES THEY EXPECT IT 
TO BE DELIVERED 
BRITAIN'S MORTGAGE LENDERS HAVE 
SAID THE BANK OF ENGLAND NEEDS TO 
DO MORE TO EASE THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
THE COUNCIL OF MORTGAGE LENDERS HAS 
WARNED THAT WITHOUT FURTHER BANK 
INTERVENTION IN THE MONEY MARKETS 
LENDING FOR MORTGAGES THIS YEAR 
MIGHT REACH ONLY HALF THE LEVEL 
SEEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
DOCTOR ANDREW WAKEFIELD WHO 
SPARKED CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE 
SAFETY OF THE M. M. R. VACCINE HAS 
ADMITTED TO A DISCIPLINARY HEARING 
THAT HE HAD POOR GRASP OF MEDICAL 
ETHICS IN RELATION TO CHILDREN HE 
IS ACCUSED OF TAKING BLOOD SAMPLES 
FROM CHILDREN AT BIRTHDAY PARTY 
A MEMORIAL SERVICE HAS BEEN HELD 
FOR MICHAEL TODD THE TPOPLER CHIEF

PRINCE WILLIAM HAS RECEIVED HIS R. A. F. 
PILOT'S WINGS FROM HIS FATHER THE 
PRINCE OF WALES FLYING OFFICER 
WALES WAS ONE OF TWENTY FIVE GRADUATES 
HONOURED AT CEREMONY AT R. A. F. KRPB 
WELL CRANWELL AND ONE OF THE 
GUESTS THERE WAS HIS GIRLFRIEND 
KATE MIDDLE MIDDLETON 
IT'S A DEFINITE DECLARATION THAT 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS ON FIRM 
GROUND AGAIN A YEAR AFTER THEIR 
BRIEF SEPARATION KATE MIDDLETON 
TOOK HER PLACE AS ONE OF WILLIAM'S 
OFFICIAL GUESTS AT HIS GRADUATION 
CEREMONY AT R. A. F. KRPB WELL 
CRANWELL THE COUPLE HAVE BEEN BACK 
TOGETHER FOR SOME MONTHS BUT SHE'S 
KEPT A LOW PROFILE AND HE HAS 
WANTED TO KEEP THE RELATIONSHIP AS 
DISCREET AS POSSIBLE 
BUT TODAY THEY WERE IF NOT SIDE BY 
SIDE IN THE AUDITORIUM CLEARLY A 
COUPLE SHARING IN HIS BIG DAY 
WILLIAM RECEIVED HIS WINGS FROM HIS 
FATHER THE PRINCE OF WALES AFTER 
A SPECIAL COURSE DURING WHICH HE 
HAS LEARNT TO FLY FIXED WING 
AIRCRAFT AND HELICOPTERS FOR IT IS 
THE COMPLETION OF THE LATEST PHASE 
OF HIS MILITARY TRAINING FOR HER 
IT IS A RE EMERGENCE ON THE PUBLIC 
STAGE WITH ALL THE EXPECTATIONS 
THAT AN APPEARANCE SUCH AS THIS ARE 
BOUND TO REKINDLE THE FOCUS OF THE 
DAY SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE R. A. F. AND 
ON WILLIAM'S ABILITIES AS A PILOT 
LEARNING TO SLIDE HAS BEEN THE 
REALISATION OF A PERSONAL AMBITION 
AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS HE HAS BEEN 
POPULAR AND DONE WELL LEARNING TO 
FLY 
HE GOT STRAIGHT IN AND WAS FLY TREATED LIKE ONE OF THE GUYS AND 
BONDED AND WE ARE ALL REALLY HAPPY 
TO HAVE HIM HE WAS HAPPY TO BE 
THERE AS WELL 
INEVITABLY THE 
IMAGE OF TODAY IS NOT OF THE FLYING 
OF THE SET IN THE AIR IT IS OF 
WILLIAM AND KATE AND WITH IT ALL 
THE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT CAUSED 
THEIR LIVES WILL TAKE IN THE FUTURE 
WILLIAM WILL BE TWENTY SIX IN A COUPLE OF 
MONTHS HE WILL BE APPROACHING 
THEIR AGE WHEN HE ONCE SAID HE 
WOULD BE READY TO GET MARRIED 
IT IS SIX SEVENTEEN P. M. OUR TOP STORY 
TONIGHT ANOTHER BLOW AT HEATHROW'S 
TERMINAL FIVE B. A. HAS POSTPONED THE 
TRANSFER OF LONG HAUL FLIGHTS THERE 
BECAUSE OF CONTINUING PROBLEMS 
IN A MOMENT WHY A SIMPLE SCHOOL 
APPLICATION LED TO A COUNCIL SPYING 
ON PARENTS 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON FEARING THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH WE GET ADVICE FOR 
HOMEOWNERS WONDERING WHAT TO DO IN 
THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES 
PLUS HE'S GOT JAMES BOND TO STAR 
IN HIS FIRST FEATURE FILM WE MEET 
ONE ESSEX BOY DONE GOOD 
EIGHT COUNCIL HAS ADMITTED USING 
LEGISLATION AIMED MAINLY AT 
TERRORISTS AND SERIOUS CRIMINALS TO 
SPY ON A MOTHER AND HER CHILDREN TO 
SEE IF THEIR APPLICATION FOR A 
SCHOOL PLACE WAS GENUINE POOLE 
BOROUGH COUNCIL SO THAT WAS TRYING 
TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF OTHER 
PARENTS WHO WANTED TO SEND THEIR 
CHILDREN TO AN OVERSUBSCRIBED 
PRIMARY ROBERT HALL JOINS US IN 
DORSET DORSET IT IS QUITE ANOTHER FOR THE 
REGULATION OF INVESTIGATORY POWERS 
ACT COVERS ALL SORTS OF SO VALINE 
QUITE A MOUTHFUL IT COVERS THE 
SURVEILLANCE IN DORSET IT HAS BEEN 
USED FOR A RATHER DIFFERENT PURPOSE 
ACTIONS WHICH HAVE THEY WERE AN 
ORDINARY FAMILY LIVING IN AN 
ORDINARY STREET BUT THEIR EVERY 
MOVE WAS BEING WATCHED POOLE 
BOROUGH COUNCIL HAD THEM UNDER 
SURVEILLANCE MORNING AND EVENING 
WHO LIVED AT THE HOUSE AND WHERE 
WERE THEY GOING ONE OF THOSE 
DESTINATIONS WAS HERE THIS SCHOOL 
JUST UP THE ROAD FROM THE 
FASHIONABLE SANDBANKS AREA OF POOLE 
THE COUPLE HAD ONE CHILD HERE 
ALREADY AND WANTED TO PLACE A 
SECOND BUT THEY HAD TWO ADDRESSES 
AND WAITED FOR A COUNCIL DEADLINE 
TO PASS BEFORE MOVING OUTSIDE THE 
CATCHMENT AREA IT WAS THAT 
ARRANGEMENT WHICH APPARENTLY 
SPARKED THE SURVEILLANCE VERY VERY SHOCKED I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW 
WHAT WAS POSSIBLE 
WE HAVE PLAYED 
THE SYSTEM TO AN EXTENT IN ORDER TO 
GET OUR CHILD INTO SCHOOL THE DO 
YOU THINK THAT IS RIGHT OBVIOUSLY 
WE HAVE SOME UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS 
ABOUT THAT BUT IT IS NO DIFFERENT 
FROM BEING ABLE TO CHOOSE TO BUY A 
HOUSE IN A CATCHMENT AREA THE THE SCHOOL'S CATCHMENT AREA COVERS 
DOZENS OF DESIRABLE STREETS THE 
SCHOOL IT IS OFTEN OVERSUBSCRIBED 
DUE IN PART TWO OUTSTANDING OFSTED 
RESULTS OTHER PARENTS WERE DIVIDED 
IF I THINK IT IS BIT WEIRD THAT 
THE COUNCIL HAD BEEN SPYING ON 
PEOPLE IT IS A LITTLE BIT FAR 
FETCHED AND BIT UNFAIR 
I THINK 
IT IS O. K. TO CHECK UP ON PEOPLE TO 
MAKE SURE THEY ARE TELLING THE 
TRUTH BECAUSE LOTS TELL LIES THE THE COUNCIL WHICH USED ITS OWN STAFF TO 
CARRY UP A SURVEILLANCE AGREED THAT 
THE SCHOOL APPLICATION WAS IN ORDER 
BUT DENIED IT USED DISPROPORTIONATE 
MEANS TO FIND OUT 
WHERE A SCHOOL 
IS HEAVILY OVERSUBSCRIBED AND WHERE 
THE MAIN CRITERIA IS TO LIVE IN THE 
CATCHMENT AREA WE HAVE A DUTY TO 
MAKE SURE WHERE THERE IS A CONCERN 
EXPRESSED BY SOMEBODY ELSE THAT 
THE APPLICATION IS HONEST HUMAN HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS HAVE ECHOED THE 
COUPLE'S CONCERNS OVER WHAT THEY 
SEE AS MISUSE OF SURVEILLANCE 
LEGISLATION THE TARGETS IN THIS 
CASE HAVE YET TO DECIDE WHETHER TO 
TAKE THAT COMPLAINT FURTHER THE 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION SAID 
OTHER COUNCILS HAVE USED THE 
LEGISLATION ALTHOUGH MAINLY 
AGAINST ROGUE TRADERS THE FRONT 
PAGE OF THE FRONT PAGE COULDN'T 
BE CLEARER POOLE BOROUGH COUNCIL 
SAYS IT WILL TAKE ANY LEGAL STEPS 
TO MAKE SURE NO CHILD IS UNJUSTLY 
STOPPED FROM ATTENDING A SCHOOL 
A CONTROVERSIAL METHOD OF OBTAINING 
D. N. A. PROFILES BY USING MUCH SMALLER 
SAMPLES THAN USUAL HAS BEEN GIVEN

THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
OLYMPIC COMMITTEE HAS SAID HE 
BELIEVES THERE IS NO PUBLIC 
APPETITE FOR A BOYCOTT OF THE GAMES 
AT THE END OF A WEEK MARRED BY 
PROTESTS AGAINST THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
RELAY JACQUES ROGGE HAS INSISTED 
IT WILL GO ON AND IT WILL PASS 
THROUGH TIBET THIS REPORT FROM THE 
CHINESE CAPITAL NOW 
BRING GLORY TO THE COUNTRY THE 
SIGN ON THE WALL REMIND THESE 
ATHLETES OF CHINA'S HOPES FOR THE 
GAMES BUT THE AUTHORITIES ARE ALSO 
WRESTLING OF HOW TO COUNTER THE 
WORLDWIDE FOCUS ON CHINA'S HUMAN 
RIGHTS TRIGGERED BY THE TORCH 
PROTEST TRYING TO ADDRESS THEIR 
IMAGE PROBLEMS THE CHINESE 
AUTHORITIES LAID ON A PRESS MEETING 
TO FOCUS BEIJING'S SPORTING PROWESS 
BUT INSTEAD OF OPENNESS A 
STRUCTURED EVENT NOT A WORD ABOUT 
HUMAN RIGHTS BUT WE LEARNT THAT 
THE HUNT BALL CAPTAIN RELAXES BY 
GOING SHOPPING THE CHINESE STILL 
BELIEVE THAT THE GAMES CAN PROMOTE 
THEIR COUNTRY AND POOR 
ONE OF 
THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGACIES WILL BE 
A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN 
CHINA AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD HOCKEY HOCKEY HAS NEVER BEEN A BIG SPORT IN CHINA 
CHINA IS DETERMINED TO DO WELL IN 
ALL OF A BIG SPORT PART OF ITS 
INTENSE DESIRE FOR THE BEIJING 
OLYMPICS TO BRING GLORY TO THE 
COUNTRY CHINA MAY EVEN TOPPED THE 
MEDALS TABLE BUT WHAT BEIJING IS 
STRUGGLING TO COME TO TERMS WITH 
IS THAT ITS POLITICAL BAGGAGE WILL 
CONTINUE TO DOG THE GAMES THE I. O. C. 
REALISES THE WIDER ISSUES 
SURROUNDING CHINA CANNOT BE WISHED 
AWAY BUT AS JACQUES ROGGE 
EXPLAINED IT IS LIMITED 
WE ARE 
NOT A SOVEREIGN ORGANISATION WE 
HAVE NO LEGISLATIVE POWER WE SPEAK 
WITH OUR ETHICAL VALUES AND WE CAN 
ONLY HOPE THAT GOVERNMENTS WILL 
LISTEN 
PROTESTERS ARE AGAIN LISTEN WAITING FOR THE TORCH IN BUENOS 
AIRES AND THE PROBLEM FOR THE 
OLYMPIC MOVEMENT REMAIN BUT 
DESPITE ITS EFFORTS THIS WEEK THE 
WORLD'S FOCUS WILL NOT QUICKLY

NOW WE WILL RETURN TO THE MAIN 
STORY BUT IT IMMUNE PROBLEMS AT 
TERMINAL FIVE WE WERE HEARING EARLIER 
THE CONTINUING PROBLEMS AT T. FIVE 
BRITISH AIRWAYS SAYS IT WANTS TO 
LEARN THE LESSONS OF THE CHAOTIC 
OPENINGS ONE OF THOSE MIGHT BE 
ABOUT LOST LUGGAGE FIVE THOUSAND BAGS ARE 
STILL TO BE REUNITED WITH 
PASSENGERS AMONG THEM IS LUISA 
BALDINI BALDINI THE FIRST DAY AT TERMINAL FIVE AND THE 
WORLD'S BUSIEST AIRPORT IS LEFT IN 
CHAOS WITH THOUSANDS QUEUEING FOR 
A WAS HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS WERE 
CANCELLED AND NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND BAGS 
WERE LEFT TO PILE UP QUEUEING FOR 
MANY HOURS ETUDE EMBARRASSMENT FOR 
BRITISH AIRWAYS AS IT UNVEILED A FOUR 
BILLION TERMINAL BUILDING 
I PRINTED OUT MY BOARDING PASS AT 
HOME TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER IT OPENED I 
THROUGH TO MANCHESTER CHECKING IN 
ONE BAG L. WAS TOLD IT HADN'T ARRIVED ARRIVED REALLY DISAPPOINTING END TO THE 
FLIGHT I THOUGHT IT WASN'T GOING 
TOO BADLY THIS IS THE TICKET FROM 
MIGHT MISSING LUGGAGE SO HOPEFULLY 
THAT WILL GET BACK TO ME 
THIS LITTLE TICKET IS ALL I HAVE 
LEFT TO REMIND ME OF MY BAG L. DID 
GET AN E. MAIL FROM B. A. TEN DAYS AGO 
TELLING ME THEY WERE DOING ALL THEY 
COULD TO GET IT BACK TO ME BUT I 
STILL HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THEM 
THERE IS A BAGGAGE HELPLINE NUMBER 
ON HERE L. AM FINALLY GOING TO 
BRING IT AND TRACK IT DOWN 
THANK YOU FOR CALLING THE BRITISH 
AIRWAYS BAGGAGE BAGGAGE TRACING 
SERVICE WE ARE CURRENTLY 
EXPERIENCING HIGH CALL VOLUMES AND 
OUR LINES ARE BUSY PLEASE CALL 
BACK 
I ALSO TRIED AND FAILED TO BACK FIND MY LUGGAGE USING THE 
BACKTRACKING WEBSITE BAG 
TRACKING WEBSITE SO AS MY QUEST 
CONTINUES I HAVE DECIDED TO RETURN 
TO T. FIVE WITH A PHOTO OF MY LUGGAGE TO 
SEE IF ANYONE CAN DIRECT ME TO IT 
WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO FILM INSIDE 
BUT SOMEONE FROM B. A. A. TOLD ME 
ALTHOUGH MY BAG IS PROBABLY 
SOMEWHERE AT T. FIVE THEY CAN'T LOCATED 
STRAIGHT AWAY B. A. L. SIMPLY HAVE 
TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO CONTACT ME 
WE HAVE INFORMATION FOR RESERVE 
THE GOOD USE THEY FOUND HER BAG 
THE BAD NEWS IT IS TWO HUNDRED MILES AWAY 
IN MANCHESTER THEY SAID SHE SHOULD 
HAVE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS GOOD LUCK 
IF YOU ARE STILL LOOKING HOPEFULLY 
THE WEATHER WILL CHEER YOU UP 
SOME OF US ARE ENDING THE DAY ON A 
FINE NOTE BUT DON'T BANK ON THAT 
CONTINUING GUSTY WINDS ACROSS 
SOUTHERN AREAS OF FORTY OR FIFTY M. P. H. AND 
HILL SNOW ACROSS WALES AND THE 
PENNINES IT WILL MOVE THROUGH 
QUITE QUICKLY WET WEATHER COMING 
INTO SCOTLAND AND SOME SNOW FOR 
THE GRAMPIAN US IT WILL BE COLDEST 
ACROSS THE NORTH TONIGHT WATCH OUT 
TOMORROW MORNING MOST OF US WILL 
SEE A SUNNY SPELLS AND BROKEN CLOUD 
BUT LATER IN THE MORNING THE 
SHOWERS WILL COME IN AND SOME WILL 
BE HEAVY 
RIGHT ALONG THE COAST YOU MAY 
AVOID THE SHOWERS BUT FURTHER 
INLAND THE SHOWERS WILL GET 
HEAVIER AND MAYBE THE ODD RUMBLE OF 
THUNDER THUNDER IN WALES SOME WILL STAY DRY BUT 
SHOWERS IN NORTHERN IRELAND MUCH 
MORE WIDESPREAD 
THE WET WEATHER WE BEGIN THE DAY 
WITH THIS IN THE CENTRAL LOWLANDS 
AND IT WILL PUSH FURTHER SOUTH 
SOME OF US WILL AVOID SHOWERS IN 
NORTHERN ENGLAND AND STAY FINE WITH 
SOME SUNSHINE BUT THE ODD ONE IN 
THE MIDLANDS 
STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE 
MARATHON BUT LOOKING LIKE A QUITE 
CHILLY START PERHAPS A RISK OF A 
SHOWER LATER IN THE RACE
