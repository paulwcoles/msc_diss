DREAM OF ANIMALS BIRDS AND BEES 
DREAM OF WIND ROCKED WAVING TREES 
OF GOLDEN LEAVES THAT START TO FALL 
UNTIL THE MORNING COMES TO CALL 
THEN AS YOU WAKE UP IN YOUR BED 
SOME LAZY DREAMS REST IN YOUR HEAD 
AS YOU RISE READY TO PLAY 
THOSE DREAMS ALL SEEM TO FLOAT AWAY 
BUT NEVER WORRY NEVER FRET 
YOUR DREAM TIME HERE'S NOT OVER YET
