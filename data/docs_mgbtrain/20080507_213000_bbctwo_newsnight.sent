AIRPORT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE 
ONE OF THE MOST SECURING VIOLENCE 
IN BRITAIN SO WHY DO WE ALLOW 
FOREIGN CRIMINALS TO WORK THERE 
SECURE ENVIRONMENT 
TONIGHT THE GAPING LOOPHOLE IN THE 
LAW WHICH MEANS YOU COULD BE A 
CONVICTED TERRORIST YET STILL HAVE 
THE RIGHT TO WORK IN BRITAIN'S 
AIRPORTS NEWSNIGHT HAS LEARNED 
THAT PRECAUTIONS WE WERE TOLD THAT 
PROTECTORS DO NOT APPLY TO SOME WHO 
WORK IN OUR AIRPORTS 
WE SHOULD 
CARRY OUT SECURITY CHECKS ON 
ANYBODY WORKING ON THE AIRPORT SITE 
ANYONE WHO FAILS SHOULD BE REMOVED 
AND ANYONE BE WHO IS EMPLOYED 
THOSE SECURITY CHECKS SHOULD BE 
COMPLETED 
DAMAGE LONGER CAN COMPLETED HILLARY CLINTON STAY IN THE RACE 
THE DEMOCRATS PONDER HOW TO GET 
HILLARY CLINTON TO RETIRE 
GRACEFULLY WHILE THE REPUBLICANS 
PLAN THEIR ONSLAUGHT ON BARACK 
OBAMA 
WHY GORDON BROWN SEEMS TO OBAMA THINK THIS ONE AND SAID SOMETHING 
QUITE DIFFERENT TO WHAT EVERYONE 
ELSE SEEMS TO THINK SHE SAID 
A AND WE TALKED TO THE FOREIGN 
SECRETARY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND 
WHEN THAT THERE IS REALLY MUCH WE 
CAN DO ABOUT IT WE TALK 
GOOD EVENING EVER SINCE THE 
OUTRAGES OF SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH 
SECURITY HAS BEEN THE TOP PRIORITY 
AT AIRPORTS IN THIS COUNTRY WE 
CANNOT FOR EXAMPLE WORK AIR SIDE 
AS IT IS KNOWN WITHOUT HAVING HAD 
A FULL CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECKED 
ACTUALLY AS NEWS THAT HAS 
DISCOVERED YOU CAN THE 
REQUIREMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO 
FOREIGNERS NEWSNIGHT L. WILL BE 
ASKING THE MINISTER RESPONSIBLE HOW 
THIS ASTONISHING OVERSIGHT OCCURRED 
AFTER THE HORROR OF SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH 
CAME THE PROMISES TO MAKE OUR 
AIRPORTS MORE SECURE THE 
GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTED A RAFT OF 
MEASURES TO TIGHTEN SECURITY AT 
TERMINALS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY 
ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL A 
CRIMINAL RECORD CHECKS FOR ALL 
STAFF WORKING S. SIDE BUT WE HAVE 
DISCOVERED A STAGGERING LOOPHOLES 
THIS SECURITY MEASURE IS NOT QUITE 
AS SECURE AS IT SEEMS IN THEORY 
AT ANY AIRPORT WORKER NEEDING TO 
WORK THEIR SIDE MUST HAVE A 
CRIMINAL RECORD CHECK UNLESS THAT 
IS AT THEY COME FROM ABROAD WE 
HAVE DISCOVERED THAT FOREIGN 
WORKERS CAN WORK AT AIRPORTS 
WITHOUT THE SUPPOSE IT MANDATORY 
KRIMML RECORDS CHECK THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WOULD BE TOO 
LONG AND TOO COMPLICATED TO CHECK 
THEIR CRIMINAL RECORDS FROM ABROAD 
CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECK 
IT IS 
ASTONISHING AND OF COURSE THE RISK 
AT ANY AIRPORT AT THE UNITED 
KINGDOM TO KNOW ABOUT THIS FOR 
FIVE YEARS AND TO DO NOTHING ABOUT 
IT IS DOUBLY ASTONISHING DO NOT DO 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT IS 
INCONVENIENT WHEN YOU THINK OF THE 
LEVEL OF INCONVENIENCE THEY PUT 
PASSENGERS TO NOT BEING ABLE TO 
CARRY MAKE UP ON NOT BEING ABLE TO 
CARRY YOUR VIOLIN ON IT IS A 
DISGRACE 
THE LIST OF OFFENCES DISGRACE COVERED BY A CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECK 
IS UNDOUBTEDLY COMPREHENSIVE 
ANYONE WHO HAS AN UNSPENT 
CONVICTION FROM ANYTHING FROM 
FRESCO THEFT TO CRIMINAL DAMAGE 
WOULD BE REFUSED A JOB IN THE 
RESTRICTED ZONE BUT THAT IS NOT 
NECESSARILY TRUE IF THOSE CRIMES 
CARRIED OUT ABROAD BECAUSE THE 
KRIMML RECORDS CHECK ONLY COVERS 
OFFENCES WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE U. K. 
THE CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECK AND 
THAT LEAVES US VERY EXPOSED RE RE REALLY NEED TO ASK THE QUESTION IS 
IT NOW NECESSARY TO RESTRICT 
EMPLOYMENT AT OUR AIRPORTS TO ONLY 
THOSE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE CAN CARRY 
OUT THE FULL PANOPLY OF CHECKS 
AROUND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WORK AT 
AIRPORTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY B. A. A. 
WOULD NOT CONFIRM HOW MUCH ARE NOT 
U. K. CITIZENS BUT IT IS ESTIMATED TO 
BE IN THE THOUSANDS THE SENSITIVE 
THE SENSITIVITY OF THEIR SIDE 
SECURITY WAS HIGHLIGHTED LAST YEAR 
JOHN PARKINSON TOLD A CONFERENCE 
THAT TERRORISTS WOULD HAVE THE 
COMPONENTS AVAILABLE 
AND WHEN AL QAEDA SYMPATHISER 
WORKING AT A SHOP IN HEATHROW WAS 
CONVICTED OF OWNING TERRORIST 
MANUALS LAST DECEMBER IT PROMPTED 
THE GOVERNMENT TO LAUNCH NEW 
REVIEW OF AIRPORT SECURITY THAT IS 
BEING HEADED BY SIR STEPHEN BOYS 
SMITH HE HAS BEEN TAKING SOUNDINGS 
FROM THE PILOT'S' UNION AND ONE OF 
THEIR KEY CONCERNS THE LACK OF 
CONSISTENT CHECKS ON STAFF ALLOWED 
IN A RESTRICTED ZONE 
I'M WOULD 
SUGGEST THAT IF SOMEONE CANNOT PASS 
A TEST LIKE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT 
BE THERE AT ALL IF IT IS GOOD 
ENOUGH FOR PILOTS IT SHOULD BE 
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANYONE ELSE SO 
THESE CHECKS NEED TO BE CARRIED OUT 
ON EVERYONE SURELY 
THE GOVERNMENT 
IS AWARE OF THE DISPARITY IN ADDIS 
IN A STATEMENT THE DEPARTMENT 
FOR TRANSPORT TOLD US THAT THE 
CZECH INCLUDES 
IT IS CRAZY TO HAVE A WHOLE 
ELABORATE SYSTEM OF CHECKS FOR 
BRITISH EMPLOYEES BUT THEN TO 
COMPLETELY IGNORE ANY POTENTIAL 
PROBLEMS FROM SOMEBODY WHO IS 
COMING FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY AND IT 
SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS CRYING OUT 
FOR AN E. U. SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS ANY 
MEMBER STATE AND ITS AUTHORITIES TO 
CHECK AGAINST THE CRIMINAL RECORDS 
OF EACH OTHER THERE IS ALREADY AN 
ACE AND PROPOSAL FOR THAT IT IS 
NOT COMPUTERISED AND NOT WORKING 
EFFECTIVELY AND IT IS THE SORT OF 
CORRECT CO OPERATION WE SHOULD BE 
DOING 
EUROPEANS HAVE A RIGHT TO DOING WORK HERE BUT PEOPLE FROM 
COUNTRIES LIKE PAKISTAN AND SOMALIA 
WILL HAVE TO BE CHECKED AGAINST THE 
TERROR WATCH LIST BEFORE BEING 
ALLOWED INTO THE COUNTRY HOWEVER 
THEY STILL WILL NOT NEED THE KRIMML 
RECORDS CHECK BEFORE GAINING 
CLEARANCE CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECK 
TODAY THE CONSERVATIVES DEMANDED 
ACTION FROM THE GOVERNMENT THEY THEY SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CARRY OUT 
SECURITY CHECKS ON ANYONE WORKING 
THERE ANYONE WHO FAILS SHOULD BE 
REMOVED AND BEFORE ANYONE ELSE IS 
IN ARE EMPLOYED THOSE SECURITY 
CHECKS SHOULD BE CREATED AND THEY 
SHOULD BE THAT IRRESPECTIVE OF COST 
AND AS FAST AS CAN BE DONE 
OTHERWISE IT IS WORSE THAN 
COMPLACENT IT IS RECKLESS 
BUT ANY 
ACTION IS UNLIKELY TO BE IMMEDIATE 
THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT SAYS IT 
WILL AWAIT THE OUTCOME OF THE 
INQUIRY AND THAT IS NOT EXPECTED 
UNTIL THIS SUMMER 
WHEN THE AVIATION MINISTER JIM 
FITZPATRICK JOINED US FROM A 
WESTMINSTER STUDIO I ASKED HIM 
HOW MANY FOREIGN CRIMINALS ARE 
WORKING IN BRITISH AIRPORTS WHAT WHAT WE CAN BE ASSURED OF IS THAT 
EVERYBODY WHO IS WORKING IN ONE OF 
OUR AIRPORTS HAS BEEN SCREENED AND 
CHECKED AND THAT WE CAN BE ASSURED 
THAT THOSE CHECKS MAKE SURE THAT 
THE TRAVELLING PUBLIC ARE SAFE HOW HOW MANY FOREIGN CRIMINALS ARE WORKING 
IN GOWER REPORT 
I CANNOT ANSWER 
THAT QUESTION WHAT I CAN SAY IS 
THAT FOR ANYONE TO BE WORKING IN 
OUR AIRPORTS PARTICULARLY IN THE 
RESTRICTED ZONES THEY HAVE TO GO 
TO RAISE AND IN THE SAME SECURITY 
MEASURES AS ANY PASSENGER AND ANY 
OTHER MEMBER WHO IS WORKING IN THE 
AIRPORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE 
SCREENED PROPERLY 
YOU DON'T EVEN 
KNOW DO YOU HOW MANY FOREIGNERS 
ARE WORKING IN OUR AIRPORTS WE WE COMMISSIONED A REVIEW INTO PERSONAL 
SECURITY CHECK AT OUR AIRPORTS I I AM ASKING YOU NOW NOT AFTER THE 
HORSE HAS BOLTED HOW MANY 
FOREIGNERS ARE WORKING IN OUR 
AIRPORTS 
I THINK YOU KNOW THAT AIRPORTS EUROPEAN WORKING REGULATIONS AS 
WELL IF NOT BETTER THAN I DO THE THE ANSWER IS YOU DON'T KNOW FOR FOR PEOPLE TO BE WORKING IN OUR AIRPORT 
TARMAC YOU DON'T KNOW A THEY HAVE 
TO BE SCREENED AND SAFE AND THEY 
HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THE SAFETY OF 
THE TRAVELLING PUBLIC IS OUR FIRST 
PRIORITY SECURITY CHECKS HAVE TO 
BE MADE ON ANY MEMBER OF STAFF 
GOING INTO OUR AIRPORTS 
BUT THESE 
PEOPLE HAVE NOT HAD THEIR CRIMINAL 
RECORDS CHECKED HAVE THEY 
NO BUT 
WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT 
ANYBODY WORKING IN A RESTRICTED 
ZONE IS SCREENED IN EXACTLY THE 
SAME THOROUGH WAY AS ANY ONE 
TRAVELLING THROUGH ALLAH AIRPORTS 
TAKING A FLIGHT ANYWHERE IN THAT 
INSTANCE WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT 
HOUR AIRPORT 
I AM NOT ASKING YOU 
ABOUT PASSENGERS WHO HAVE THE 
PLEASURE OR MS. FORTUNE OF PASSING 
THROUGH OUR AIRPORTS L. AM TALKING 
ABOUT PEOPLE WORKING IN OUR 
AIRPORTS AS THINGS STAND IT IS 
THE CASE GULLIT IS IT NOT THAT YOU 
COULD BE A CONVICTED POLISH GUN 
RUNNER OR EVEN A CONVICTED FRENCH 
TERRORIST AND BE WORKING AT 
HEATHROW AND YOU WOULD NOT KNOW 
ABOUT IT 
WHAT WE WOULD BE 
ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT OF 
I AM 
RIGHT AREN'T I 
ANYONE WORKING AT 
OUR AIRPORTS WOULD HAVE TO GO 
THROUGH THE STANDARD SCREENING PROCESS AS 
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TRAVEL OR 
ANYONE ELSE WORKING AT AN HOUR 
AIRPORTS 
THE SAME BUT THEY AIRPORTS HAVEN'T BEEN THROUGH THE SAME 
SCREENING PROCESS HAVE THEY THEY 
HAVE NOT HAD THEIR CRIMINAL RECORDS 
CHECKED 
THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE CHECKED SAME PROCESS WHEN THEY ARRIVED FOR 
WORK THEY HAVE TO BE SCREENED TO 
MAKE SURE THERE ARE ARRANGEMENTS 
SO AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT CARRYING 
A GUN WHEN THEY GO TO WORK THAT IS 
ALL RIGHT IT IS IT 
YOU CAN BE 
ASSURED THAT IF THEY ARE CARRYING A 
GUN AND THEY GO THROUGH THE 
SECURITY SCREENING THEY WILL BE 
FOUND OUT 
BUT AS LONG AS THEY ARE 
NOT CARRYING A GUN YOU HAVE NO 
IDEA IT COULD BE ANYBODY YOU HAVE 
ALREADY CONCEDED YOU DO NOT KNOW 
HOW MANY FOREIGNERS ARE WORKING 
THERE AND THAT YOU DO NOT CHECK THE 
CRIMINAL RECORDS OR FOREIGNERS 
WORKING THERE 
WE HAVE COMMISSIONED 
A REVIEW 
THIS IS FIVE YEARS 
AFTER THE EVENT 
THAT REVIEW IS 
UNDERWAY AT THE MOMENT IN THE 
MEANTIME WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
MAKE SURE OF IS THAT ANYONE WORKING 
IN OUR AIRPORTS OR IN A RESTRICTED 
ZONE WOULD GO THROUGH THE SAME 
SCREENING PROCESS AS ANY MEMBER OF 
THE PUBLIC WHO IS TRAVELLING ON ANY 
OF ALLAH AIRLINES 
DO YOU REALLY 
NEED SOMEONE TO COME IN TO TELL YOU 
THAT A PIECE OF LEGISLATION YOU 
FRAMED WHICH IS TOTALLY DEFECTIVE 
IN ONE SERIOUS REGARD IT IS 
DEFECTIVE 
WHAT WE NEED 
TO DO IS DEFECTIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UPGRADE OUR 
SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS PENDING UPON 
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
ARENA WE NEED TO REVIEW THESE ON A 
DAILY WEEKLY MONTHLY BASIS THERE 
IS NO WAY THAT WE CAN BE COMPLACENT 
IN TERMS OF TERRORISM WE HAVE TO 
MAKE SURE WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE 
ASKED TO HAVE THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR 
PERSONAL SECURITY LOOKED AT WHICH 
IS WHY WE HAVE THE LAYERED APPROACH 
WHICH IS WHY ANYBODY WORKING IN OUR 
AIRPORT AS TO THE SCREEN WHICH IS 
WHY THEY HAVE TO BE SCREENED TO A 
HIGH LEVEL IN WORKING IN A MORE 
SENSITIVE AREA 
DO YOU NEED SOMEONE 
TO TELL YOU THAT 
WHAT WE NEED TO 
MAKE SURE OF IS THAT THE 
ARRANGEMENTS ARE IN PLACE TO SCREEN 
STAFF AND THAT THEY ARE SOUND WE 
ARE CONFIDENT THAT THEY ARE THERE 
IS A HIGHER DEGREE OF REQUIREMENT 
SO IT IS O. K. FOR KRIMML TO BE 
WORKING CRIMINALS TO BE WORKING 
IT IS IT YOU HAVE JUST TOLD US YOU 
THINK IT IS FINE 
WE NEED TO REVIEW AND UPGRADE 
SECURITY AS DEVELOPMENTS TAKE PLACE 
IF I WAS IN YOUR SHOES I WOULD SAY 
YES THERE APPEARS TO BE A LOOPHOLE 
HERE AND I AM GLAD TO HAVE DRAWN TO 
MY INTENTION AND WE WILL SORT IT 
OUT AT ONCE 
JEREMY I AM NOT IN 
DENIAL I AM NOT IN THE BALL GAME 
OF SAYING THAT EVERYTHING IS 
PERFECT THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE 
GUARANTEE WHEN IT COMES TO ANTI 
TERRORISM AND SECURITY WHAT I AM 
SAYING IS THAT THE ARRANGEMENTS 
THAT ARE IN PLACE WE BELIEVE THEY 
ARE APPROPRIATE BUT WE HAVE ASKED 
SIR STEPHEN TO REFUTE THOSE 
ARRANGEMENTS AND IF WE NEED TO 
UPGRADE THEM WE WILL DO THAT TO 
REVIEW THOSE ARRANGEMENTS I'M NOT 
SAYING EVERYTHING IS PERFECT 
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE FULLY ISH 
THIS TIME LAST NIGHT THERE WAS 
SERIOUS TALK ABOUT HOW BARACK OBAMA 
WAS IN DANGER OF LOSING THE 
INITIATIVE IN THE RACE FOR THE 
DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION WHAT A 
DIFFERENCE A DAY MAKES THE RESULTS 
OF THE PRIMARIES IN NORTH CAROLINA 
AND INDIANA TODAY PERSUADED FORMER 
SENATOR GEORGE MCGOVERN THE 
PARTY'S CANDIDATE FOR THE WHITE 
HOUSE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO TO ABANDON SUPPORT 
FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND ENDORSE 
BARACK OBAMA TELLING MRS. CLINTON 
TO GIVE UP IN MOMENT I WILL 
SPEAK TO JAMES RUBIN WHO HAS BEEN 
A HILLARY SUPPORTER PUTS UP BEFORE 
THAT PETER MARSHALL REPORTS 
HILLARY SUPPORTER 
THERE IS STILL LONG WAY TO GO BUT 
TODAY THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
LOOKS GOOD DEAL CLEARER THANKS THANKS TO YOU IT IS FULL SPEED ON TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE 
SUDDENLY THOUGH IT 
SEEMS IT WILL BE BARACK OBAMA WHO 
THE DEMOCRATS HOPE WILL BE HEADING 
DOWN PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE NOT 
HILLARY CLINTON THE NUMBERS IN 
OBAMA'S FAVOUR CAN NO LONGER BE 
DENIED AND HILLARY CLINTON WILL 
HAVE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THAT AT 
SOME POINT LAST NIGHT FOR ALL HER 
DEFIANCE AT TIMES SHE SEEMED TO BE 
EDGING TOWARDS RECONCILIATION AT 
FIRST THOUGH SHE MAINTAINED 
EVERYTHING WAS IN THE BALANCE 
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING THIS RACE AND 
THEY ARE WONDERING I WYNN HE WINS 
I WYNN HE WINS IT IS SO CLOSE 
BUT IT REALLY ISN'T THAT CLOSE ANY 
LONGER WE'VE BUILT BEHIND LOOKING 
GRIM SHE ACKNOWLEDGED PERSONAL 
DEFEAT DID NOT LOOK DID NOT MEAN 
DEFEAT FOR THE PARTY WITH BUILT 
BEHIND 
I WILL WORK WITH THE BEHIND NOMINEE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
BECAUSE WE MUST WIN 
OBAMA'S TOTAL 
OF PLEDGED DELEGATES IS 
THAT GIVES HIM A LEAD OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE 
ALMOST UNASSAILABLE WITH ONLY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN 
DELEGATES AT STAKE IN THE CONTEST 
STILL LEFT IN THE POPULAR VOTE HE 
IS HALF A MILLION AHEAD THE 
MOMENTUM AND THE VOTES ARE MOVING 
WITH OBAMA ANY SLENDER CASE 
HILLARY CLINTON MAY HAVE HAD FOR 
ASKING THE PARTY BOSSES THE SUPER 
DELEGATES TO CALL THE NOMINATION 
IN HER FAVOUR HAVE ALL BUT 
DISAPPEARED OBAMA AFTER HIS FOURTEEN 
WIN IN NORTH CAROLINA HIS FIRST 
BIG STATE VICTORY IN THREE MONTHS 
WAS RELIEVED FOURTEEN POINT WIN YOU YOU STOOD UP TO THE DOUBTERS WHEN WE 
WERE UP AND WHEN WE WERE DOWN YOU 
STILL BELIEVE THAT THIS IS OUR 
MOMENT AND OUR TIME TO CHANGE 
AMERICA TONIGHT WE STAND LESS 
THAN TWO HUNDRED DELEGATES AWAY FROM 
SECURING THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION 
FOR PRESIDENT OF THE U. S. A. 
THIS IS 
THE DEMOCRATS NATIONAL 
HEADQUARTERS AND THE PEOPLE INSIDE 
ARE FRANTICALLY TRYING TO WORK OUT 
A STRATEGY TO BRING THIS WRESTLING 
MATCH TO AN END AND SOMEHOW ALLOW 
HILLARY CAVE TO SAVE FACE HILLARY 
WAS SPOTTED GOING INTO THE 
HEADQUARTERS THE SHORT TIME AGO 
THE STRATEGIST TOLD US SHE WILL 
HAVE BEEN GIVEN SOME HOME TRUTHS I I THINK THE WRITING IS ON THE WALL 
BARACK OBAMA HAS WHAT APPEARS TO BE 
AN INSURMOUNTABLE LEAD L. THINK THE 
CLINTON CAMPAIGN WILL HOPE FULLY 
REALISED THAT SOONER RATHER THAN 
LATER 
WHAT PRESSURE WILL BE LATER BROUGHT TO BEAR 
THE SUPER 
DELEGATES WILL BE SAYING THAT IT IS 
A PROBLEM AND THE FUND RAISERS WILL 
BE SAYING THE SAME THING 
ULTIMATELY THIS IS HER DECISION 
BUT I THINK SHE WILL MAKE THE BEST 
DECISION FOR THE PARTY TODAY TODAY HILLARY CLINTON WAS WEARING HER 
BRAVEST FACE IN WEST VIRGINIA 
SCENE OF NEXT WEEK'S PRIMARY WHICH 
IN THE LIGHT OF LAST NIGHT'S SEEMS 
IRRELEVANT HER CAMPAIGN IS OUT OF 
CASH AND SHE HERSELF HAS HANDED 
OVER SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST MONTH 
DONE TOP OF FIVE MILLION THAT SHE 
LEANT IN FEBRUARY 
I AM STAYING IN 
THIS RACE UNTIL THERE IS A NOMINEE 
I AM GOING TO WORK AS HARD AS I CAN 
TO BECOME THAT NOMINEE 
SHE WILL BE 
UNDER PRESSURE TO EASE UP ON THE 
AGGRESSION ALTHOUGH ONE OF HER 
CAMPAIGN TEAM SUGGESTED HE MAY YET 
BE CONCEALING THAWS WHICH COULD BE 
REVEALED LATER HE CALLED IT AN 
OCTOBER SURPRISE HARDEEP FRATERNAL 
THERE IS A LOT OF HYSTERIA IN THE 
CLINTON CAMPAIGN HARDLY 
FRATERNAL THAT WILL SETTLE DOWN 
BUT YOU SAY THEY HAVE NOT ACCEPTED 
REALITY YET 
IT IS DIFFICULT WHEN 
YOU HAVE BEEN IN A CAMPAIGN AS LONG 
AS THEY DO BUT I THINK THE WRITING 
IS ON THE WALL AS LONG AS THIS 
THIS IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE 
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND 
THE PEOPLE INSIDE HAVE ENJOYED 
WATCHING THE DEMOCRATS IN THE LAST 
FEW WEEKS THEY KNOW IT WILL SOON 
BE OVER BUT EVEN NOW THEY HOPE 
THERE WILL BE ANOTHER PAY OFF FROM 
ALL THE PROTRACTED BLOODLETTING 
ALREADY IN SOME SOUTHERN STATES 
REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING TO EXPLOIT 
OBAMA'S UNPOPULARITY BY LINKING HIM 
TO LOCAL DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING FOR 
OFFICE 
THAT MAY BE GROOVY IN OFFICE CALIFORNIA BUT IN MISSISSIPPI 
THAT DOT WILL NOT HUNT 
IT IS 
BELIEVED THE REPUBLICANS WILL MAKE 
OBAMA'S PAST AND RAISED AN ISSUE 
BUT NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS SAY THAT 
IS NOT THEIR STYLE 
EVERY PARTY HAS 
ITS OWN PARTY AND SOME STATE 
PARTIES HAD ALREADY CHOSEN TO GO 
ONE WAY YOU WILL SEE INDEPENDENT 
GROUPS ON BOTH SIDES THEY WILL DO 
THINGS OUTSIDE OF WHAT THE CAMPAIGN 
THINKS HIS MOST BENEFICIAL FOR 
JOHN MCCAIN IT WILL BE FOCUSED ON 
THE ISSUES 
SO YOUR HANDS WILL BE 
CLEAN 
WE INTEND TO RUN A CAMPAIGN CLEAN BASED ON THE ISSUES BASED ON THE 
WAR AND THE ECONOMY 
AND RACE WILL 
NOT COME INTO IT 
AS I SAID WE 
PLAN ON RUNNING ON THE ECONOMY AND 
THE WAR 
SO OBAMA IS ALMOST HOME 
FREE FOR THE NOMINATION TODAY HE 
WAS ENDORSED BY ANOTHER PARTY ELDER 
GEORGE MCGOVERN CYNICS SAY THEY 
ARE SIMILAR LIBERAL IDEALISTS NO 
GOVERN RAN FOR PRESIDENT AND 
ATTRACTED THE YOUNG AND IDEALISTIC 
BEFORE BEING CRUSHED BY THE 
REPUBLICANS REPUBLICANS WE ARE JOINED BY JAMES RUBIN 
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE 
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AND CLOSE TO 
HILLARY CLINTON IT LOOKED AS IF IT 
IS RUNNING TO THE END FOR HILLARY 
NOW DOESN'T IT 
WELL WE ARE 
ALMOST AT THE END OF THE PRIMARIES 
THERE IS ABOUT THREE WEEKS LEFT L. 
DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH CHANCE OF 
HILLARY CLINTON GETTING OUT BEFORE 
THEN DESPITE THE COMMENTARY YOU 
JUST SHOWED THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO 
DON'T KNOW HILLARY CLINTON AND HAVE 
NO CLUE AS TO WHAT THEIR INTENTIONS 
ARE I DID TALK TO HER EVERY DAY 
BUT I WOULD BET MY HOUSE THAT SHE 
IS COMING TO STATE IN THIS PRIMARY 
CAMPAIGN UNTIL THE PRIMARIES ARE 
OVER I DON'T TALK TO HER EVERY 
DAY 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT SHE DAY CAN'T GET THE NUMBERS SHE HASN'T 
GOT THE MONEY TODAY SHE HAD A 
GEORGE MCGOVERN JUMP SHIP WHAT 
DOES IT TAKE FOR HER TO DECIDE THAT 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH L. AM DOING DAMAGE 
TO THE PARTY I LOVED 
FIRST OF ALL 
I KNOW THE NAME GEORGE MCGOVERN HAS 
MEANING OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED 
STATES GIVEN THE FACT THAT HE WAS 
A NOMINEE BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU 
THAT MOST DEMOCRATS BARELY REMEMBER 
GEORGE MCGOVERN AND HE HAS NOT 
PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN 
AMERICAN POLITICS IN A VERY LONG 
TIME SINCE I WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS 
OLD SO I DON'T THINK THAT IS 
REALLY RELEVANT AS FAR AS YOUR 
MATHEMATICS QUESTION LOOK THIS 
HAS BEEN A TOUGH THING FOR HER TO 
DO FOR MANY WEEKS NOW NOTHING HAS 
REALLY CHANGED OVERNIGHT THE 
NUMBERS THAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT 
WERE THE NUMBERS EVERYBODY EXPECTED 
THEY ARE THE SAME BASIC DEMOGRAPHIC 
BREAKDOWN AS WHAT HAPPENED IN 
PENNSYLVANIA BUT THE EXPECTATIONS 
GAME WAS PLAYED PRETTY BADLY I 
THINK BY THE CLINTON TEAM AND 
SUDDENLY IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS ALL 
OVER WHEN YESTERDAY IT DIDN'T L. 
NEVER QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW THESE 
EXPECTATION GAMES GET PLAYED BUT I 
CAN ASSURE YOU THAT EVERYTHING I 
KNOW EVERYTHING THAT FRIENDS OF 
MINE WHO OPERATE MORE CLOSELY WITH 
HILLARY ON A DAILY BASIS NOTHING 
HAS CHANGED BETWEEN TODAY AND 
YESTERDAY 
SHE IS FORCED TO LEND YESTERDAY HER OWN CAMPAIGN MONEY 
WELL ONE 
OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT CAME OUT 
DURING THIS CAMPAIGN IS THAT MRS. 
CLINTON HAS THAT KIND OF MONEY SO 
THAT SHE IS IN A POSITION TO DO 
THAT BUT LOOK SHE MADE A LOT OF 
NEW CONTRIBUTORS TEN MILLION DOLLARS ALSO 
CAME IN AFTER THE PENNSYLVANIA WIN 
I BET THAT IF YOU HAVE ME ON YOUR 
PROGRAMME TWO WEEKS FROM NOW SHE 
WILL HAVE ONE WEST VIRGINIA BIG 
SHE WILL HAVE ONE KENTUCKY BICH 
AND SHE MAY COME CLOSE IN OREGON 
SUDDENLY THE MONEY WILL COME BACK 
THESE THINGS HAVE THEIR CYCLE AND 
RIGHT NOW THE PUNDITS HAVE WRITTEN 
HER OFF 
SHE MAY WIN THOSE STATES 
BUT SHE WILL NOT BE THE FRONT 
RUNNER 
WELL NO SHE IS NOT THE RUNNER FRONT RUNNER SHE HASN'T BEEN THE 
FRONT RUNNER FOR MONTHS 
SHE WILL 
NOT BE EVEN IF SHE WINS WEST 
VIRGINIA AND KENTUCKY WEST WEST VIRGINIA AND KENTUCKY STILL WILL 
NOT MAKE HER THE FRONT RUNNER YOU 
ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT LOOK I THINK 
SENATOR CLINTON STILL HAS A CHANCE 
A SMALLER LESS THAN FIFTY TO FIFTY CHANCE 
OF BEING THE NOMINEE AND THAT IS 
BASED ON THE FOLLOWING SCENARIO 
SHE WINS MOST OF THE REMAINING 
STATES IF NOT ALL WHEN YOU ADD UP 
THE POPULAR VOTE YOU DISCOVER THAT 
SHE HAS MORE POPULAR VOTES BENTE 
BARRETT MACRO AND FINALLY YOU 
LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN 
AND YOU DISCOVER THAT A LOT MORE OF 
THE PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR HIM WILL 
VOTE FOR HER IF SHE WERE THE 
NOMINEE THAN THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
SHE HAS MORE POPULAR VOTES THAN 
BARACK OBAMA THAT IS WHAT THAT 
JUDGMENT IS ALL GOING TO BOIL DOWN 
TO NOTHING HAS REALLY CHANGED 
THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE THE JUDGMENT 
OF WHEN IT COMES TO THE CRUCIAL 
DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONS THE 
CENTRISTS THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATS 
WINNING AND LOSING THERE IS A 
STRONG ARGUMENT TO BE MADE THAT IN 
THAT CASE A LOT MORE OF THE OBAMA 
VOTERS WILL VOTE FOR HILLARY AND 
PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR HILLARY WILL 
VOTE FOR OBAMA L. KNOW THAT SOUNDS 
COMPLICATED BUT THAT IS WHAT THE 
EXPERTS WILL LOOK AT THEY WILL 
LOOK AT THE POPULAR VOTE AND IT 
MAY STILL HAPPEN 
THANK YOU 
THE MILITARY RULERS OF BURMA DON'T 
SEEM TO HAVE QUICKENED THEIR PACE 
MUCH TODAY AS THE REST OF THE WORLD 
IMPLORES THEM TO DO MORE TO MAKE IT 
POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO HELP THE 
SURVIVORS OF CYCLONE NARGIS THE UN 
SECRETARY GENERAL AGAIN ASKED THEM 
TO LET IN MORE AID WHILE STATE RUN 
MEDIA SAID IT WAS ALREADY COMING IN 
AT LEAST TWELVE COUNTRIES HAVE TEAMS ON 
STANDBY UNABLE TO TRAVEL TO BURMA 
HERE THE DISASTERS EMERGENCY 
COMMITTEE HAS LAUNCHED AN URGENT 
APPEAL TO HELP VICTIMS I'M JOINED 
BY GREG BARROW FROM THE UN WORLD 
FOOD PROGRAMME ARE YOU ABLE TO GET 
STUFFED INTO BURMA 
WE HAD THREE 
PLANES ONE OR TWO OF MITCH OF 
WHICH MAY HAVE LANDED ALREADY THEY 
SHOULD BE THERE BY MORNING 
OFFLOADING HIGH ENERGY BISCUITS 
THIS HAS COME AFTER QUITE A LOT OF 
NEGOTIATION WITH THE AUTHORITIES 
WE ARE AT THE MOMENT TAKING THAT AS 
A POSITIVE SIGN WE HAVE HAD 
ASSURANCES WE CAN GET MORE STAFF IN 
WE ARE HOPING THAT BY THE END OF 
THE WEEK WE WILL GET MORE IN MORE 
SPECIALISTS WHO ARE ABLE TO DO WITH 
THIS 
WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE OF THE THIS NEED 
STAGGERING TO USE ONE WORD NEED WE HAVE HAD ASSESSMENT TEAMS OUT 
WE ARE LOOKING AT HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
LITERALLY LOST ALMOST EVERYTHING 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO A 
WAVE OF WATER THAT HAS SWEPT IN 
ACROSS THE IRRAWADDY DELTA AREA 
AND WHO HAVE PERHAPS BEEN WITHOUT 
CLEAN WATER AND FOOD SINCE SATURDAY 
SO GETTING TO THEM IS ABSOLUTELY 
VITAL AT THIS POINT IN TIME 
AS R. 
AS THE LOGISTICS IF YOU CAN 
PERSUADE THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES TO 
LET YOU MOVE PEOPLE IN THERE CAN 
THEY THEN GET AROUND 
WELL CLEARLY 
WE ARE GOING TO NEED BOATS IT IS 
THE KIND OF OPERATION WE SAW AFTER 
THE TSUNAMI IN OTHER PARTS OF ASIA 
WHERE ONE NEEDS A HELICOPTERS 
THERE IS GIVEN TO BE A LOT OF 
HECTIC HEAVY LIFTING REQUIRED AND 
IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT THOSE KIND OF 
RESOURCES ARE IN THE COUNTRY AT THE 
MOMENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH HAVE TO 
BE MADE TO BRING THAT EQUIPMENT IN 
TO ENSURE THAT RAPIDLY THE AID AND 
ASSISTANCE CAN GET TO THE PEOPLE IN 
NEED THANK YOU 
BEFORE THAT THOUGH A ROUND UP UP OF 
TODAY'S NEWS THOUSANDS OF FOREIGN 
CRIMINALS MAY BE WORKING AT 
BRITAIN'S AIRPORTS SPEAKING ON 
THIS PROGRAMME THE TRANSPORT 
MINISTER JIM FITS PATTIC INSISTED 
CURRENT SECURITY CHECKS WERE 
ADEQUATE 
I'M NOT IN DENIAL HERE ADEQUATE I'M NOT THE BALL GAME OF SAYING 
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT THERE IS NO 
ABSOLUTE GUARANTEE WHEN IT COMES TO 
ANTI TERRORISM SECURITY WHAT I'M 
SAYING IS THAT THE ARRANGEMENTS 
WHICH ARE IN PLACE WE BELIEVE ARE 
APPROPRIATE 
THE GOVERNMENT IS TO APPROPRIATE MAKE CANNABIS A CLASS B. DRUG ONCE 
AGAIN AGAINST THE RECOMMENDATION OF 
IT IS OWN VIZORS MINISTERS ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT LINKS BETWEEN THE 
USE OF THE DRUG AND MENTAL HEALTH 
PROBLEMS THE RECLASSIFICATION 
MEANS THE MAXIMUM PENALTY FOR 
POSSESSING CANNABIS WILL INCREASE 
FROM TWO YEARS IN PRISON TO FIVE A 
CHARITY EVENT WAS HELD IN LONDON 
TONIGHT TO SHOW PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR 
THE ARMED FORCES TOONDS RAISE MONEY 
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED 
WHILE ON ACTIVE DUTY THE CITY 
SALUTE OUTSIDE LONDON'S SAINT PAUL'S 
CATHEDRAL IT WAS ATTENDED BY 
PRINCES WILLIAM AND HARRY THE 
MARKETS 
NOW IF YOU WERE WATCHING LAST NIGHT 
YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD HAZEL BLEARS 
DEFENDING THE DECISION OF THE PARTY 
ACCORDING TO GORDON BROWN SHE 
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING OF THE SORT 
QUITE WHAT SHE DID SAY 
COMING OUT WITH THIS U. TURN IN 
SCOTTISH LABOUR POLICY FOR AN EARLY 
REFERENDUM ON THE INDEPENDENCE AS 
YOU KNOW THE S. N. P. ADMINISTRATION HAS 
COMMITTED TO HOLDING A REFERENDUM 
IN TWO THOUSAND TEN IN A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS 
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS WENDY 
ALEXANDER HAS BEEN ARGUING FOR AN 
EARLIER REFERENDUM THAN THAT 
STARTING IN INTERVIEWS SHE DID FOR 
SCOTLAND ON SUNDAY FOR THE B. B. C. THE 
S. N. P. APPEAR TO BE TOYING WITH THE 
ELECTORATE OF SAYING WE WANT THIS 
IT IS THE REASON WE CAME INTO 
POLITICS WE ARE FRIGHTENED TO BRING 
THE MATTER FORWARD L. DON'T FEAR THE VERDICT OF THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE 
BRING IT OFPBLT 
I DON'T THINK IT IS 
ACCEPTABLE TO LEAVE IT UNTIL FOUR 
YEARS AT THE END OF THE SCOTTISH 
PARLIAMENT BEFORE YOUETH GET AROUND 
LETTING THE PEOPLE HAVE THE SAY L. 
DON'T DOUBT FOR A MOMENT THE PEOPLE 
OF OF SCOTLAND WON'T BACK THE S. N. P. 
WHAT I'M SIGNAL SOMETHING THAT THE 
LABOUR PARTY DOESN'T DOUBT FOR 
MOMENT WHAT THE CHOICE OF THE 
SCOTTISH PEOPLE WILL BE AND THEY 
SHOULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO SPEAK ON 
THIS ISSUE 
IS GORDON BROWN 
ENDORSING YOUR DECISION TO CALL FOR 
A REFERENDUM YES 
HE SEINE DORSING YES IT YES HE TOLD YOU THAT YES IT YES YES ENDORSING IS DEBATABLE WENDY 
ALEXANDER'S ANNOUNCEMENT ON SUNDAY 
CAME AS A SURPRISE TO DOWNING 
STREET I THINK ANYBODY LISTENING 
TO PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS TODAY 
WOULD DOUBT WHETHER GORDON BROWN 
WAS ENDORSING WHAT SHE HAD SAID 
WHEN INEVITABLY DAVID CAMERON 
RAISED THE ISSUE 
WENDY ALEXANDER 
SAYS THERE SHOULD BE A REFERENDUM 
NOW ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE DOES 
HE AGREE WITH HER 
THAT IS NOT WHAT 
SHE HAS SAID MR. SPEAKER THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY THE LIBERAL 
PARTY AND THE LABOUR PARTY HAD 
JOINED TOGETHER IN SEGT UP THE 
CALMAN REVIEW L. HOPE WE CAN SEE 
PROGRESS IN THAT COMMISSION WE WILL 
REVIEW THE PROGRESS BEFORE MAKING 
ANY FURTHER DECISIONS THE CULLMAN 
REVIEW IS DUE TO ISSUE A REPORT 
THIS NOVEMBER IT'S FULL REPORT 
NEXT YEAR 
DO WE KNOW WHAT GORDON 
BROWN REALLY THINKS THFRPBLTS IS 
THE INTRIGUING THING THERE HAS 
BEEN A STRATEGIC DEBATE BETWEEN 
LABOUR IN EDINBURGH AND LABOUR IN 
LONDON OVER THIS SINCE LAST 
WHEN THEY LOST THE ELECTIONS WENDY 
ALEXANDER WHO WAS ELECTED SCOTTISH 
LABOUR LEADER LAST SUMMER HAS BEEN 
THE LEADING ADVOCATE OF THE EARLY 
REFERENDUM CAUSE GORDON BROWN HAS 
DISCUSSED THIS AT GREAT LENGTH WITH 
HER AND CERTAINLY HAS TOYED WITH 
THE IDEA I'M TOLD THAT HE'S NOT 
YET PERSUADED THAT IT IS THE RIGHT 
POLICY ONE IMAGINES THAT WITH ALL 
OF HIS OTHER PROBLEMS THAT IS 
SCOTLAND IS THE LAST THINK HE 
THING HE WANTS TO THINK ABOUT AT 
THE MOMENT WOULD YOU SAY HER 
POSITION IS SECURE 
IT IS A 
DIFFICULT ONE SHE HAS FIRST 
MINISTER'S QUESTIONS TO CONTEND 
WITH TOMORROW THE OPPOSITION 
PARTIES IN SCOTLAND ARE CALLING ON 
HER TO RESIGN AS THEY HAVE DONE ON 
OTHER ISSUES IN THE PAST BUT I 
THINK IT SHOULD BE STRESSED IN FACT 
WITHIN THE SCOTTISH LABOUR PARTY 
THIS POLICY IS QUITE POPULAR 
THE SCOTTISH LABOUR PARTY HAS BEEN 
DEMORALISED FOLLOWING LAST YEAR'S 
ELECTION DEFEAT THE RISE OF S. N. P. 
AND ALEX SALMOND AND HAS BEEN 
LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF INITIATIVE 
TO PUT THE S. N. P. ON THE BACK FOOT AND 
TO CALL THEIR BLUFF THE SAME TIME 
OF COURSE GORDON BROWN WOULD BE 
DESPERATELY SORRY TO SEE WENDY 
ALEXANDER GO DESPITE THIS PROBLEM 
HE IS WELL DISPOSED TO HER I 
UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE THIS IRONIC 
STRANGE SITUATION IT WASN'T THAT 
LONG AGO THAT WENDY ALEXANDER WAS 
ACTUALLY HELPING TO WRITE GORDON 
BROWN'S SPEECHES ON THE WHOLE 
QUESTION OF THE UNION 
THANK YOU 
ENERGY WARS WATER WARS FOOD WARS 
ALL THAT TALK JUST A FEW SHORT 
YEARS AGO ABOUT THE END OF HISTORY 
HAS TURNED OUT TO BE BUNK INSTEAD 
THE WORLD INTO WHICH OUR CHILDREN 
AND GRANDCHILDREN GO FORTH LOOKS 
MORE FRAITED WITH POTENTIAL 
CATASTROPHE THAN AT ANY TIME IN 
MEMORY UNDERLYING EVERYTHING OF 
COURSE IS THE THREAT OF SEVERE 
CLIMATE CHANGE THE FOREIGN 
SECRETARY TONIGHT SUGGESTED IT 
NEEDN'T BE ALL DOOM AND GLOOM WE 
WILL TALK ABOUT THAT SHORT LIFPLT 
HE IS THE MAN OF THE MOMENT WHO IS 
DAVID MILIBAND AT FORTY TWO HE IS FOURTEEN 
YEARS YOUNGER THAN THE PRIME 
MINISTER AN M. P. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE TONY 
BLAIR MADE HIM ENVIRONMENT 
SECRETARY TWO YEARS AGO HESM WAS 
GORDON BROWN'S FOREIGN SECRETARY 
THE THE FOLLOWING YEAR PROSPECTS 
GOOD TODAY'S TIMES POLLS SUGGESTS 
FIFTY FIVE PER CENT OF LABOUR VOTERS WANT A YOUNGER 
FRESHER ALTERNATIVE THAN BROWN TO 
FIGHT THE NEXT ELECTION 
HE HAS BEEN PRESSUREED TO STAND 
BEFORE 
DO WHAT PRIME MINISTER SAYS BEFORE STAND UP 
GORDON BROWN'S POSITION 
HAS NEVER LOOKED SO WEAK IN THE 
RAVEL MILIBAND LECTURE NAMED AFTER 
HIS FATHER HE PROCLAIMED GREEN IS 
THE NEW RED 
HE CALLS FOR INSULATING HOMES FUEL 
EFFICIENT CARS AND LESS ELECTRICITY 
USE CARBON STORAGE TECHNOLOGY 
HYBRID CARS AND BIOFUELS HE WANTS 
TO ENSURE CAPS ARE SET CENTRALLY IN 
A GLOBAL CARBON MARKET SAYS 
TARGETED REGULATION IS OFTEN NEEDED 
FOR GREEN TECHNOLOGY 
AND THAT THE E. U. BUDGET AND CAP MUST 
BEREDEFINED TO OPEN UP GLOBAL 
MARKETS 
HE HAS PRESENTED POWERFUL MARKETS ANALYSIS THE QUESTION IS WHY WE ARE 
ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION 
WITH THE PRIME MINISTER CONTRADICT 
WHRAG IS BEING 
WE ASKED FOR YOUR QUESTIONS FOR HIM 
TOO TOO ON OUR WEBSITE YOU HAVEN'T EXACTLY 
BEEN SHY DAVID MILIBAND IS GOING 
TO ANSWER MOST OF THOSE ON OUR 
WEBSITE I BELIEVE TOMORROW AREN'T 
YOU ONE OF THEM GRAHAM NIXON YOU 
BELIEVE IN A LOW CARBON ECONOMY YOU 
CAN'T BELIEVE IN A THIRD RUNWAY AT 
HEATHROW AIRPORT SNFRPBLGT I DON'T 
THINK THAT IS RIGHT WE BELIEVE THE 
CLIMATE CHANGE BILL WHICH HAS CROSS 
PARTY SUPPORT WHICH THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAS LED THROUGH THE HOUSE 
OF COMMONS OUR CARBON EMISSIONS 
WILL HAVE TO COME DOWN BY SIXTY PER CENT IT 
DOESN'T MAT FER WE REDUCE THEM FROM 
BUILDINGS OR AVIATION OR FROM 
SURFACE TRANSPORT IT DOESN'T 
MATTER HOW WE GET THE CARBON 
REDUCTIONS DOWN WHAT MATTERS IS 
THEY COME DOWN IN TOTAL AVIATION 
IS SIX PERCENT OF THE TOTAL YOU 
ARE SAYING YOU CAN HAVE GROWTH IN 
AVIATION AND LOW CARBON ECONOMY 
IT IS NOT INCOMPATIBLE AIVAIG 
AVIATION IS SIX PERCENT IN BRITAIN 
ENERGY AND HOUSING THIRTY FIVE PER CENT 
IT DOESN'T 
NECESSARILY COME IN AIR TRANSPORT 
THEN THEN LET'S TAKE THE QUESTION OF ENERGY 
GENERATION GENERATION THE GOVERNMENT IS SHORTLY TO RULE 
ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW COAL 
FIRED POWER STATION IN KENT THAT 
CANNOT BE BUILT CAN IT IN A LOW 
CARBON ECONOMY UNLESS THERE IS A 
CARBON CAPTURE FACILITY OPERATING 
AS SOON AS IT BEGINS PRODUCING 
THIS SOMETHING THAT I ADDRESSED IN 
THE LECTURE THAT I GAVE TONIGHT AND 
THAT YOU REFER TOFPLTD THE E. U. HAS A 
COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT FIFTEEN POWER 
STATIONS AROUND EUROPE ARE BUILT 
WITH CARBON STORAGE TECHNOLOGY 
BRITAIN HAS ONE OF THE ONLY 
COMPETITION THAT IS ARE BEING RUN 
WITH PUBLIC FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT 
IS ACHIEVED 
IT CANNOT BEGIN 
PRODUCING POWER WITHOUT CARBON 
CAPTURE BEING OPERATIONAL CAN IT 
IN RESPECT OF COMPETITION WITH 
NEW POWER STATION KINGS NORTH THING 
IS A SEPARATE DECISION OBVIOUSLY 
WE HAVE AN ENERGY MIX WHICH 
INCLUDES 
COULD WE HAVE NEW COAL 
FIRED POWER STATIONS WITHOUT THERE 
BEING INTEGRAL AND OPERATIONAL 
CARBON CAPTURE FACILITY FROM DAY 
ONE 
NOT IF THE E. U. REQUIRES AS IT ONE IS PROPOSING TO TO GO FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN TO 
ENSURE THAT IS THE CASE 
FORGET THE 
E. U. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO IN OUR 
GOVERNMENT 
WE WANT TO MAKE THE GOVERNMENT COMMITMENTS OF OUR CLIMATE CHANGE 
BILL THAT CAN COME REMEMBER ON 
HOUSING WHICH IS THIRTY FIVE PER CENT WE ARE MOVING 
TO CARBON NEUTRAL HOUSING BY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN 
YOU ARE GETTING OFF CARBON CAPTION 
YOU DON'T THINK IT HAS TO HAPPEN 
IMMEDIATELY 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY IS THIS THERE EUROPE'S 
FIRST COAL FIRED POWER STATION WITH 
CARBON CAPTURE STORAGE TECHNOLOGY 
IN BRITAIN THAT IS GOOD THING 
COULD NEW COAL FIRED POWER STATIONS 
BE BUILT IN THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT AN 
INTEGRAL IMMEDIATELY OPERATIONAL 
CARBON CAPTURE FACILITY IN THEM 
THEY COULD 
SHOULD THEY BE 
THAT IS 
A SEPARATE QUESTION 
I'M ASKING YOU 
THAT DEPENDS ON PROTGRES WE MAKE 
WITH THE DEMONSTRATION PLANT WE ARE 
MAKING 
THE ROYAL SOCIETY SAY THEY MAKING CAN'T THEY SAY IT'S ABSOLUTELY 
THEY MAY IN NORWAY THEY ARE DOING 
IT LET'S LEARN FROM WHAT HAPPENS 
WHAT ABOUT BIOFUELS DO YOU THINK 
THE USE OF LAND TO CREATE BIOFUELS 
IS MORALLY SUSTAINABLE WHEN WE NOW 
KNOW THEY DEPRIVE POORER PEOPLE OF 
FOOD 
NOT IF THEY DO THAT NOT FOOD THAT IS UNSUSTAINABLE APPROACH LET 
ME PUT THE COUNTERPOINT TO YOU WE 
HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY LAND THAT IS 
SETE SIDE NOT ALLOWED TO BE USED 
BECAUSE OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURE 
POLICY IF WE USE THAT LAND THAT IS 
NOT 
THAT IS A FRACTION OF THE 
LAND IN THIS COUNTRY SNFRPBLT IT IS 
MAKING THE POINT WHAT PROPORTION 
OF THE NEED FOR FUEL IN THIS 
COUNTRY COULD BE GROWN FROM BIOFUEL 
SOURCES ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SETE 
SIDE LAND SNFRPBLGT I HAVEN'T GOT 
THAT FIGURE YOU WILL FIND IT'S 
TINY IN ORDER TO MEET OUR NEEDS YOU 
WOULD NEED TO CARPET THE ENTIRE 
COUNTRY IN BIOFUEL PRODUCT NO ONE NO ONE WANTS TO CARPET 
YOU CAN'T DO IT 
ON SETE SIDE 
I'M MAKING THE POINT 
THERE ARE BAD WAYS OF PROMOTING 
BIOFUELS AND SENSIBLE WAYS OF DOING 
IT UNSUSTAINABLE AND SUSTAINABLE 
IT IS NOT SENSIBLE TO DEPRIVE FOOR 
PEOPLE OF THEIR FOOD WHICH IS THE 
EXAMPLE YOU GAVE THAT DOESN'T MEAN 
THERE IS NO PLACE FOR BIOFUELS 
THIS IS ALL VERY GOOD AS CONSPIRE 
RATIONAL STUFF BUT NONE OF IT IS 
REMOTELY PRACTICAL 
I SET NOUGHT MY 
SPEECH FIVE WAYS IN WHICH WE WILL 
MAKE PROGRESS YOU CALL IT AS 
CONSPIRE RATIONAL L. PLEAD GUILTY 
TO THAT REMEMBER PEOPLE ARE PAYING 
ONE POINT TWO FOUR FOR A LITRE OF PETROL BECAUSE 
DEMAND FOR OIL FAR OUTSTRIPS SUPPLY 
YFPLT IS THAT BECAUSE OUR CAR 
REGULATION ALLOWS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY GRAMS 
KILOMETER OF POLLUTION ETC THAT IS 
YU NEED THE BALANCE OF REGULATION I 
TALKED ABOUT TONIGHT 
YOU HAVE A 
TOUCHING FAITH IN THE E. U. 
WE ARE 
BERT OFF IN THE E. U. WE CAN ACHIEVE 
THROUGH A MARKET OF FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION 
PEOPLE GLOBAL STANDARDS IF EUROPE 
SETS STANDARDS FOR CASH EMISSIONS 
OR OR PRODUCTS IT CAN MAKE BIG 
PROGRESS 
THE EXAMPLES SO FAR OF PROGRESS THE EUROPEAN TRADING SCHEME IT IS A 
FIASCO 
WHY DO YOU SAY IT FIASCO COMPANIES WERE OFFERED THIS MONEY 
THEY SOLD IT ON 
TODAY FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE PERIOD 
IT 
HAD A BAD START IT IT HAD A BAD START THERE WEREN'T THE 
CENTRAL CAPS YOU REFERRED TO AT THE 
BEGINNING AM FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND TWELVE CARBON 
IS TRADING AT A GOOD THING IT AS 
PROPER MARKET EUROPEAN WIDE MARKET 
IT ENSURE THERE IS IS PROPER PRICE 
ON POLLUTION L. THINK YOU CAN 
HAPPY TO PLEAD GUILTY TO THE NOTION 
THAT EUROPE HAS TO LEARN FROM ITS 
MISTAKES WHEN I'M IN CALIFORNIA 
NEXT WEEK THEY WILL SAY WE WANT TO 
JOIN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION SCHEME 
NOT POUR SCORN ON IT 
SHOULD THERE 
BE AN INCREASE IN FUEL DUTY IN THE 
AUTUMN 
THAT IS MATTER FOR THE AUTUMN CHANCELLOR 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT CHANCELLOR GREEN POLICIES IS IT DESIRABLE TWO P. TWO P. DISCUSSED IN RESPECT OF FUEL DUTY 
IS OUTSTRIPED BY THE RISE IN THE 
COST OF PETROL AS A RESULT OF THE 
RISE IN THE OIL PRICE 
AT A POLICY 
LEVEL BY THE DEED SHALL YOU KNOW 
THEM ARE YOU TO BE REALLY TAKEN 
SERIOUSLY AS A GOVERNMENT THAT 
CARES ABOUT REDUCING CARBON 
EMISSIONS IF YOU ARE NOT PREPARED 
TO DO SOMETHING WHICH MAY BE 
ELECTORALLY UNPOPULAR BY PUTTING TWO P. 
HANG ON THE TEST IS OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS GOING 
DOWN THEY HAVE GONE DOWN IN THIS 
COUNTRY OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS 
GREEN GAS HOUSE EMISSIONS HAVE GONE 
DOWN WE HAVE DONE THAT WHILE THE 
ECONOMY HAS GROWN BY TEN PER CENT 
AT A 
POLICY LEVEL DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE 
SHOULD CREATE A NEW CATEGORY OF 
PERSON WHO SHOULD PERHAPS BE 
ENTITLED TO ASYLUM IN COUNTRIES 
LIKE OURS THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
VICTIMS OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
NEVER HEARD THAT 
BEFORE NO 
DOESN'T IT STRIKE YOU 
AS A SENSIBLE IDEA CLIMATE CHANGE 
WILL HAVE CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES 
FOR VARIOUS NEEM VARIOUS PARTS OF 
THE WORLD IF THEY DISCOVER THEY 
CANNOT SUSTAIN THEIR WAY OF LIFE AS 
A CONSEQUENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE 
WHICH WE ACCEPT IS LARGELY A 
QUONSQUENS OF WESTERN ACTIVITY 
SHOULD WE NOT THEN MORALLY BE 
OBLIGED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH 
ASYLUM 
NO NO WHERE IS THE MORAL ASYLUM NO JUSTICE IN THAT 
BECAUSE IT IS GOOD 
SENSE THAT WHAT WE SHOULD TRY TO DO 
IF WE CANNOT MITIGATE THE AFFECTS 
OF CLIMATE CHANGE THEN WE SHOULD 
HELP THEM ADOPT IF THAT MEANS THEY 
CAN'T LIVE WHERE THEY WERE LIVING 
WE HAVE TO HELP SUPPORT THEM LIVE 
SOMEWHERE ELSE 
BUT NOT HERE L. L. 
DON'T THINK ASYLUM IS THE ANSWER TO 
CLIMATE CHANGE'S TURN L. WON'T 
MAKE ANY LINK TO THE CURRENT STATE 
OF YOUR PARTY HOW MUCH LONGER CAN 
YOU RESIST THESE CALLS FOR YOU TO 
TAKE ON THE BURDEN OF LEADERSHIP 
WELL FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES UNTIL 
GORDON BROWN CALLS THE NEXT 
ELECTION BECAUSE HE WAS THE RIGHT 
LEADER LAST YEAR HE IS THE RIGHT 
LEADER THIS YEAR AND THE RIGHT 
LEADER TO LEAD US INTO THE GENERAL 
ELECTION 
ONE OF OUR VIEWERS WHO ELECTION WROTE INTO TODAY WONDERS WHETHER 
YOU STILL NURTURE AMBITIONS TO BE 
PRIME MINISTER IENCH NURTURE 
AMBITIONS TO BE A GOOD FOREIGN 
SECRETARY ARE NOT ANSWERING THE 
QUESTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE 
PRIME MINISTER FRPBL I WANT TO BE 
A GOOD FOREIGN SECRETARY WHAT 
MAKES ME GET UP IN THE MORNING IS 
THE JOB I'VE GOT IF YOU WORRY 
ABOUT YOUR NEXT JOB YOU LOSE YOUR 
CURRENT ONE L. WANT TO DO THE JOB 
I'M DOING AT THE MOMENT IT IS 
POSSIBLY THE NEXT JOB WHEN YOU 
LOOK AT GORDON BROWN AND YOU SEE 
THE MESS THAT YOUR PARTY IS IN DO 
YOU BELIEVE HE IS THE BEST POSSIBLE 
LEADER YOUR PARTY COULD HAVE YES YES THERE IS NO ONE WHO COULD POSSIBLY 
A. B. BETTER LEADER OF YOUR PARTY THAN 
GORDON BROWN 
CORRECT HE WAS THE 
RIGHT MAN LAST YEAR HE IS THE RIGHT 
MAN THIS YEAR L. L. WORK WITH HIM 
EVERY DAY ESEE SOMEONE WHO IS 
MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS FOR 
BRITAIN IN THE END 
WHY DON'T 
PEOPLE LIKE HIM 
WHAT THEY WANTED 
TO GIVE US A KICK BEING LAST WEEK 
THEY DID IT EFFECTIVELY FOR THE 
FIRST TIME EVER WE HAVEN'T JUST GOT 
A CREDIT CRUTCH CREDIT CRUNCH 
CRUNCH WHICH WE HAVE WE HAVE AL 
RESOURCE CRUNCH WE HAVE PRESSURE 
ON MORTGAGES BUT ALSO PRESSURE ON 
FOOD AND FUEL THAT HAS NEVER 
HAPPENED BEFORE THAT HAS NEVER 
HAPPENED BEFORE THAT DOUBLE WHAMMY 
THAT DUAL CRUNCH IN RESPECT OF 
RESOURCES AND IN RESPECT OF CREDIT 
THAT IS A BIG THING WE ARE GETTING 
TO GRIPS WITH WHAT IS INTERESTING 
THE TEST WILL BE AT THE NEXT 
ELECTION WHAT IS INTERESTING I 
HAVEN'T SEEN A SINGLE PERSON SAY WE 
HAVE DONE THE WRONG THING IN 
RESPECT SIX THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
PUTTING MONEY INTO THE BANKS L. 
HAVEN'T SEEN A SINGLE PERSON 
ACTUALLY 
THAT WAS IN THE BLAIR 
GOVERNMENT 
WHAT ALISTAIR DARLING GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED TWO WEEKS AGO FIFTY 
BILLION PACKAGE WHICH HAS BEEN 
APPLAUDED AROUND THE WORLD AS THE 
RIGHT THING THE TEST IN THE END 
WILL BE WAS IT THE RIGHT THING TO 
DO TINGE WAS 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
SHAMBLES OVER WHETHER THERE SHOULD 
BE OR SHOULDN'T BE A REFERENDUM OF 
INDEPENDENCE IN SCOTLAND IS IT 
YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT IDEA 
OF A REFERENDUM BEFORE TWO THOUSAND TEN IS 
SOMETHING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER 
SUPPORTS 
I THINK THAT YOU JUST SUPPORTS PLAYED A CLIP WHICH TO BE HONEST 
IS 
DIFFERENT QUESTION N. C. H. HE 
TALKED ABOUT THIS CULLMAN REVIEW

THE SCOTTISH LABOUR PARTY SHE IS

MINISTER EXPLAINING THIS REVIEW IS 
GOING ON ACCORDING TO HAZEL BLEARS

CULLMAN REVIEW IS FOLLOWED THROUGH 
WENDY IS THE LEADER OF THE SCOTTISH 
PARTY I SUPPORT AND PRIME MINISTER 
SUPPORTS
