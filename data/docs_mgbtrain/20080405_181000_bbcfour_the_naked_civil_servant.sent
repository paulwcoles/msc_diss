AND IT COMES TO YOU HE NEVER WAS A STRANGER 
AND YOU SAY O. K. THE BRIDGE OR SOMEPLACE LATER 
AND THEN LEANING ON YOUR WINDOWSILL 
HE'LL SAY ONE DAY YOU CAUSED HIS WILL TO WEAKEN

I TOLD YOU WHEN I CAME I WAS A STRANGER 
WHEN THESE PEOPLE CAME TO ME 
AND SAID WE SHOULD LIKE TO MAKE A FILM OF YOUR LIFE

FILMS ARE FANTASIES FILMS ARE MAGICAL ILLUSIONS 
YOU CAN MAKE MY LIFE A FANTASY AS I HAVE TRIED BUT FAILED TO MAKE IT 
BUT THEN THEY SAID WE WANT THE FILM TO BE REAL 
YOU KNOW REAL LIFE

AND IT'S TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE PUTTING THINGS IN STORE ANGEL 
YOU COULD BE AN UNFURNISHED TENANT 
BLISS 
COMPLETE AND UTTER BLISS 
IN THE LOWER DEPTHS OF CHELSEA I BECAME UNFURNISHED AND IMMOVABLE 
AND ALONE 
CRISP 
YES SIR 
GET IN THERE COME ON MOVE 
CRISP SIR 
SIT DOWN 
YOUR HAIR'S DYED 
YES SIR 
A MAN DYING HIS HAIR IS A SIGN OF SEXUAL PERVERSION 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS 
YES SIR 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD HOMOSEXUAL MEANS 
YES I AM HOMOSEXUAL 
WAIT HERE 
HOW OLD ARE YOU THIRTY ONE 
IT SAYS HERE TWENTY FIVE 
I SAID TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WOULD GET ME INTO THE ARMY SOONER 
WHY DID YOU WANT TO GET IN THE ARMY 
IN ORDER TO AVOID STARVATION 
RIGHT TAKE THOSE OFF LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT YOU 
BEND OVER 
I THINK I OUGHT TO EXPLAIN THAT I'VE VERY RARELY GONE IN FOR SODOMY 
NOT FOR SOME YEARS NOW 
I MEAN IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 
STAND UP PUT THOSE THINGS ON AGAIN 
WHAT USE DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE TO THE ARMY 
ANYONE CAN GET KILLED 
WAIT HERE 
SIT DOWN 
I'M A PSYCHIATRIST OH YES SIR 
YOU SAY YOU ARE HOMOSEXUAL 
I AM HOMOSEXUAL IRRETRIEVABLY 
BUT YOU WANT TO JOIN THE ARMY YES 
THEN WHY DID YOU COME HERE LOOKING AS YOU DO 
WELL 
I DIDN'T PUT ON ANY OF MY USUAL MAKE UP 
I THOUGHT I MUSTN'T BLIND THEM WITH IT 
BUT THERE'S MY HAIR AND MY FINGERNAILS 
I WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE I MUSTN'T MAKE IT SEEM AS THOUGH I'M 
TRYING TO DISGUISE THE FACT THAT I'M HOMOSEXUAL IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR 
IN ANY CASE I COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET RID OF THE DYE 
YOU HAVE TO GROW IT OUT AND THAT CAN TAKE QUITE A LONG TIME 
I COULD HAVE CUT IT BUT I THOUGHT WHEN I JOIN THE ARMY 
THEY'LL CUT IT FOR ME AND APART FROM SAVING ME THE EXPENSE 
IT WOULD PROVIDE ME WITH A PERMANENT EXCUSE 
MY HAIR IS SHORT BECAUSE THEY'VE CUT IT 
THE WAY YOU SEE ME NOW IS BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE IT TO ME 
THE BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY WILL PASS FROM MY SHOULDERS 
DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION 
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS 
HAVE YOU A FANTASY VISION OF YOURSELF AS A FIGHTING MAN 
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THE ONLY SOLDIERS I KNOW 
SPEND THEIR TIME LOADING PETROL CANS UNDER LORRIES IN BANBURY 
I'M SURE EVEN I CAN DO THAT 
I MUST ADMIT THAT I'M MORE LIKELY TO BE KILLED BY THE ENGLISH THAN BY THE GERMANS 
BUT I'VE TAKEN THAT RISK FOR YEARS NOW 
DO YOU READ YOUR BIBLE NOT CONSTANTLY 
MALE AND FEMALE CREATED HE THEM 
MALE AND FEMALE CREATED HE ME 
ARMED WITH A CERTIFICATE SAYING EXEMPT SUFFERING FROM SEXUAL PERVERSION I HAD A HAPPY WAR 
IN THE BLACKOUT THE WHOLE OF LONDON WAS MY PLAYGROUND

SUFFERING FROM SEXUAL PERVERSION 
THAT'S RIGHT

MOVE ALONG 
TWENTY MINUTES LATER IN ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST 
QUENTIN HOW ARE YOU LOVE HELLO 
MUST GET TO THE THEATRE BE GOOD 
I'M DEPRESSINGLY GOOD 
JUST A MINUTE YOU 
OH HELLO YOU AGAIN 
WE'RE TAKING YOU IN FOR SOLICITING 
FOR WHAT SOLICITING FOR AN IMMORAL PURPOSE QUICK MARCH 
IT WAS AN EVENTUALITY THAT I HAD EXPECTED FOR MANY A LONG YEAR 
I CAN'T THINK WHY I ACTED SURPRISED 
I WAS ASSAILED BY TWO CONTRARY FEELINGS 
THE FIRST WAS THAT HERE WAS THE LONG AWAITED SITUATION WHICH WOULD NEED ALL MY POWERS OF SURVIVAL 
THE SECOND WAS THAT I MIGHT EASILY FALL IN A DEAD FAINT AND IT'D BE JUST AS WELL IF I DID 
QUENTIN CRISP YOU ARE CHARGED WITH SOLICITING FOR AN IMMORAL PURPOSE ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH 
IN CATHERINE STREET RUSSELL STREET AND TAVISTOCK STREET 
DO YOU PLEAD GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY 
NOT GUILTY SPEAK UP I CAN'T HEAR YOU 
NOT GUILTY SIT DOWN MR. CRISP 
THANK YOU SIR 
I SWEAR BY ALMIGHTY GOD THE EVIDENCE I GIVE SHALL BE THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH 
SO HELP HIM GOD 
ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH I WAS ON PLAIN CLOTHES PATROL DUTY IN THE WEST END 
TOGETHER WITH DETECTIVE CONSTABLE J. ROBINSON 
AT APPROXIMATELY SIX P. M. IN CATHERINE STREET I SAW THE ACCUSED 
HE APPROACHED AND SPOKE TO A MAN WHO TURNED AWAY FROM HIM AS IF OFFENDED AND WALKED RAPIDLY AWAY 
THEN WITH DETECTIVE CONSTABLE ROBINSON I KEPT THE ACCUSED UNDER OBSERVATION AT A DISTANCE OF FIFTEEN YARDS 
WHILE HE PROCEEDED FROM CATHERINE STREET INTO TAVISTOCK STREET DRURY LANE AND INTO RUSSELL STREET 
THIS WAS FROM APPROXIMATELY SIX P. M. UNTIL APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED TWENTY 
DURING THIS TIME HE APPROACHED THREE OTHER MALE PERSONS AND SPOKE OR ATTEMPTED TO SPEAK TO THEM 
IN EACH CASE AFTER A FEW WORDS SPOKEN ON BOTH SIDES THE PERSON TO WHOM THE ACCUSED HAD BEEN SPEAKING 
TURNED AND WALKED AWAY FROM HIM LOOKING AS IF DISGUSTED AND HORRIFIED 
THE FINAL OCCASION I SAW THIS HAPPEN WAS IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE FORTUNE THEATRE IN RUSSELL STREET 
AT APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED TWENTY I THEN WENT UP TO THE ACCUSED INFORMED HIM OF THE CHARGE 
AND TOOK HIM INTO CUSTODY AT BOW STREET POLICE STATION 
ONE MUST NEVER SAY THAT THE POLICE ARE LIARS' 
DO YOU WISH TO ASK THE OFFICER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS EVIDENCE 
STAND UP 
ER NO 
WHY DON'T I WISH TO QUESTION HIM 
BECAUSE YOU MUST NEVER SAY THAT THE POLICE ARE LIARS 
AT APPROXIMATELY SIX P. M. IN CATHERINE STREET I SAW THE ACCUSED 
HE APPROACHED AND SPOKE TO A MAN WHO TURNED AWAY AS IF OFFENDED 
FOURTEEN YEARS AGO I CEASED TO BE A HOMOSEXUAL PROSTITUTE 
OF MY OWN ACCORD I THREW OFF THE BURDEN OF HOMOSEXUALITY BY TRANSFORMING IT INTO A CAUSE 
I DECIDED TO MAKE THE PROBLEM CLEAR BY MAKING IT EVIDENT 
I MUST NOW DO SOMETHING PUBLICLY TO FIGHT FOR THAT CAUSE 
LOOKING DISGUSTED AND HORRIFIED THE FINAL OCCASION ON WHICH I SAW THIS HAPPEN 
WAS IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE FORTUNE THEATRE IN RUSSELL STREET AT APPROXIMATELY SIX TWENTY P. M. 
I THEN WENT UP TO THE ACCUSED INFORMED HIM OF THE CHARGE AND TOOK HIM INTO CUSTODY 
HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO SAY MR. CRISP 
YES YOU MAY SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY FROM WHERE YOU ARE 
OR IF YOU WISH YOU MAY GO INTO THE WITNESS BOX IN WHICH CASE YOU WILL BE PUT TO OATH 
NOW WHICH DO YOU PREFER 
WELL I CAN'T POSSIBLY PLAY MY BIG SCENE WITH MY BACK TO THE AUDIENCE 
THE WITNESS BOX PLEASE 
TAKE THE BOOK IN YOUR RIGHT HAND AND 
I SWEAR BY ALMIGHTY GOD THE EVIDENCE I SHALL GIVE SHALL BE THE TRUTH 
THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH 
YOUR NAME QUENTIN CRISP 
QUENTIN YOU ARE A MALE PERSON I PRESUME 
YES YOUR ADDRESS FULL ADDRESS 
NINETY SEVEN BEAULIEU STREET LONDON S. W. THREE ENGLAND 
DO YOU DENY THE FACTS AS GIVEN IN EVIDENCE BY THE TWO POLICE OFFICERS 
YES ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE POLICE ARE LIARS NO 
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THEN 
I AM SAYING THAT I THINK THEY WERE MISTAKEN 
DO YOU DENY THAT YOU WERE IN THE PLACES MENTIONED AT THE TIMES MENTIONED 
NOT AT ALL NO I WAS DEFINITELY IN CATHERINE STREET AT SIX O'CLOCK 
I REMEMBER THIS PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IT WAS THEN THAT THE TWO GENTLEMEN 
WHO LATER ARRESTED ME CAME UP AND SPOKE TO ME FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THEY WHAT THEY ASKED TO SEE MY PAPERS 
I SHOWED THEM MY EXEMPTION PAPERS WHICH SAY THAT I AM SUFFERING FROM SEXUAL PERVERSION 
IS THIS TRUE 
YES SIR IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT I AM A SEXUAL PERVERT 
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN QUITE SURE ABOUT THE WORD SUFFERING 
YOU ARE A SEXUAL PERVERT 
YES YOU ARE ATTRACTED TO MEN AND NOT TO WOMEN YES 
YOU GO TO BED WITH MEN 
I HAVE SOMETIMES YES DO YOU DENY THAT YOU SPOKE TO MEN IN THE STREET 
I DENY THAT I APPROACHED ANYONE OR THAT I SPOKE TO ANYONE BEFORE HE SPOKE TO ME 
BUT YOU SPOKE TO MEN ONLY IF THEY DEMANDED SOME REPLY 
IN CATHERINE STREET 
I DON'T THINK I SAID ANYTHING IN CATHERINE STREET 
IT WAS THERE THAT A MAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID FORGIVE ME 
YOU EFFING PANSY YOU OUGHT TO BE LOCKED UP 
AND I DIDN'T REPLY BECAUSE THIS REALLY DIDN'T SEEM TO DEMAND ANY REPLY 
AND IN TAVISTOCK STREET 
I THINK IT WAS TAVISTOCK STREET THAT A MAN CAME UP TO ME 
AND PUSHED ME IN THE CHEST BUT I CAN'T BE ABSOLUTELY SURE 
WHY NOT BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME 
MR. CRISP ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE POLICE OFFICERS MISINTERPRETED WHAT THEY SAW 
I AM SAYING THAT THEY MADE A VERY NATURAL MISTAKE 
THEY HAD SEEN FROM MY PAPERS THAT I WAS HOMOSEXUAL 
GOOD HEAVENS THEY COULD HAVE TOLD FROM MY APPEARANCE AS YOU CAN NOW 
THEY WERE WATCHING ME FROM FIFTEEN YARDS OR SO WHEN I HAD THESE BRIEF EXCHANGES WITH VARIOUS MEN 
AND IT MAY WELL HAVE SEEMED FROM A DISTANCE 
BUT YOU ARE SAYING ON OATH 
THAT IN NO CASE DID YOU MAKE THE FIRST APPROACH 
MY LORD 
NO 
I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR 
SIR LOOK AT ME 
I WEAR LIPSTICK I WEAR ROUGE I WEAR MASCARA ON MY EYELASHES 
I DYE MY HAIR I WEAR FLAMBOYANT CLOTHES FAR MORE OUTRE THAN THOSE I'M WEARING NOW 
I AM A SELF EVIDENT SELF PROFESSED EFFEMINATE HOMOSEXUAL 
FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE 
HOW COULD I HOPE TO SOLICIT ANYBODY IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN A CROWDED LONDON STREET LOOKING AS I DO 
WHAT WOULD I EXPECT BUT A CURSE AND A BLOW 
NO MY APPEARANCE SETS ME APART FROM THE REST OF HUMANITY 
IT IS NOT EASY FOR ME TO MAKE HUMAN CONTACTS 
WITH STRANGERS IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE 
I LEARNED MANY YEARS AGO THE GOLDEN RULE OF MY LIFE 
IN PUBLIC PLACES I DO NOT SPEAK TO ANYONE UNLESS THEY SPEAK TO ME 
I DO NOT LOOK AT ANYONE UNLESS THEY DEMAND THAT I LOOK AT THEM 
IT IS THE ONLY WAY I KNOW OF GETTING SAFELY TO MY DESTINATION 
HAVE YOU ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY MR. CRISP 
YES I HAVE NEVER REFRAINED FROM ANY COURSE OF ACTION 
ON THE GROUND THAT IT WAS ILLEGAL OR IMMORAL 
BUT I NO LONGER ASK STRANGE MEN FOR MONEY BECAUSE I DO NOT THINK THAT I WOULD GET IT 
PERHAPS 
PERHAPS MY VERY EXISTENCE IS A FORM OF IMPORTUNING 
OTHERWISE I AM NOT GUILTY AS CHARGED 
THANK YOU 
PLEASE RETURN TO THE DOCK
