WE ARRIVED AT KING'S COLLEGE HOSPITAL 
AND WENT TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT 
WE THEN WENT INTO THE UNIT AND POINTED ACROSS TO THE NEAREST BED 
LYING ON IT AND HALF SUBMERGED 
BENEATH A MASS OF PIPES WIRES AND TAPES 
WAS A SMALL HEAVILY BANDAGED FIGURE 
HER FACE WAS BLACK AND BLUE AND PUFFED UP LIKE A BALLOON 
BUT BY THE FRECKLES ACROSS THE TOP OF HER NOSE ABOVE THE OXYGEN MASK 
I KNEW HER INSTANTLY TO BE JOSIE 
TWELVE YEARS AGO JOSIE RUSSELL WAS LEFT FOR DEAD 
ON A QUIET COUNTRY LANE IN KENT 
HER MOTHER AND YOUNGER SISTER DIED FOLLOWING THIS VICIOUS ATTACK 
REMARKABLY JOSIE SURVIVED 
IT WAS JUST THIS LITTLE TINY SCRAP LYING IN THE BED 
AND IT JUST SEEMED TO BE A MIRACLE REALLY THAT SHE WAS STILL ALIVE 
ONE MOMENT SHE WAS NOT GONNA SURVIVE AT ALL 
NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS GOING TO BE SEVERELY BRAIN INJURED 
THE AREA OF DAMAGE ON THE SCAN WAS REALLY QUITE LARGE 
THE POTENTIAL FOR FULL RECOVERY OF HER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE 
WAS ACTUALLY NOT GOOD 
JOSIE RUSSELL'S JOURNEY HAS BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY ONE 
AGAINST ALL ODDS SHE SURVIVED ONE OF THE MOST BRUTAL ATTACKS OF RECENT YEARS 
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE PAST IT CAN'T BRING LIN AND MEGAN BACK 
I'VE NEVER REALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT 
BECAUSE I WAS ONLY NINE AT THE TIME 
BUT NOW I THINK I'M READY TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME 
AND HOW IT AFFECTED WHO I AM TODAY 
JOSIE'S ABOUT TO CELEBRATE HER TWENTY FIRST BIRTHDAY 
FOR HER IT'S A SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE 
SHE'S MOVED OUT OF THE FAMILY HOME 
AND BOUGHT A HOUSE IN BANGOR NORTH WALES 
WHERE IS THIS PIECE OF CORAL FROM ALL THE WAY FROM FIJI 
FROM WHEN YOU WENT THERE YEAH 
SHAUN RUSSELL LOST HIS WIFE LIN AND YOUNGEST DAUGHTER MEGAN IN THE ATTACK 
AND HAS SINCE DEVOTED HIS TIME AS A SINGLE PARENT TO BRING UP JOSIE 
I LIKE IT WHEN HE COMES OVER AND SEES MY HOUSE 
AND SEE WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT IT 
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN PULL YOUR LEG THAT MUCH 
WHEN I WALKED IN THE DOOR TONIGHT AND SAID 
OH I'LL NOT BOTHER CLEARING UP THEN WHOOPS 
THAT WAS THE WRONG THING TO SAY 
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE HAVE I 
NO IT'S TIDIER THAN IT USUALLY IS YEAH IT'S GREAT 
I THINK HE THINKS I'M FINE 
AND HE DOESN'T PHONE ME LIKE EVERYDAY ASKING ME HOW I AM 
AND DO I HAVE ENOUGH FOOD AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
I THINK HE KNOWS THAT I CAN COPE AND I CAN 
I'M HAPPY TO SIT BACK AND GET FED IT'S ALMOST READY 
O. K. DARLING 
JOSIE HAS DONE SO WELL PEOPLE TEND TO FORGET 
THAT SHE DID SUFFER A BRAIN INJURY 
SHE WAS DAMAGED PHYSICALLY BY THE ATTACK ON HER MANY YEARS AGO 
AND THAT DID LEAVE HER 
WITH A RELATIVELY SERIOUS KIND OF IMPAIRMENT 
IN TERMS OF HER ABILITY ON READING AND WRITING SPEECH AND LANGUAGE 
PEOPLE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE'S NOT 
COME THROUGH THIS UNSCATHED 
THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE COGNISANCE OF THE FACT THAT SHE HAS BEEN 
PERMANENTLY AFFECTED BY THIS IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY 
IT WAS JULY NINTH NINETEEN NINETY SIX 
WHEN SHAUN RUSSELL RETURNED TO HIS HOME IN CHILLENDEN KENT 
TO DISCOVER THAT HIS WIFE AND TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS WERE MISSING 
AFTER HOURS OF WAITING HE RECEIVED THE WORST POSSIBLE NEWS 
AT FIRST I'D BEEN TOLD THAT ALL THREE 
LIN MEGAN AND JOSIE HAD BEEN KILLED 
POLICE OFFICERS HAD FOUND THE BODIES OF LIN MEGAN 
AND JOSIE RUSSELL AND LUCY THE PET DOG IN WOODLAND NEAR THEIR HOME 
MIRACULOUSLY SHAUN THEN LEARNT 
THAT ONE OF HIS TWO DAUGHTERS WAS STILL ALIVE THOUGH CRITICALLY ILL 
I WAS IN AN ALMOST DEMENTED LEVEL OF GRIEF 
THE FACT THAT MOST OF MY FAMILY HAD BEEN KILLED 
WAS THE MOST OVERWHELMING CONCERN IN MY MIND OF COURSE 
YET I'D BEEN SAVED BY THIS KNOWLEDGE 
THAT ONE OF THEM WAS ALIVE 
EVERY TIME I GO BACK TO SEE HER 
I WAS PREPARED AS I SAW HER LYING THERE IN INTENSIVE CARE 
ON LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM 
TO LOOK AFTER HER FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE 
NO MATTER WHAT SITUATION SHE WAS IN 
HOW BADLY BRAIN DAMAGED SHE WAS' 
I FEAR FOR THE SAFETY OF ANYBODY ANY PERSON WHO HE IS NEAR 
ANY ANIMAL WHO HE IS NEAR 
HE KILLED MY DOG AT THE SAME TIME AS MY WIFE AND CHILD 
HOW JOSIE SURVIVED TO THIS DAY WE STILL CANNOT IMAGINE 
CONSIDERING THE DAMAGE THAT WAS CAUSED TO HER 
BUT FOR SOME REASON SHE PULLED THROUGH AND THE OTHER TWO DIDN'T 
I'VE BEEN THINKING OF TRYING TO GET WORK OR SOMETHING AFTER THAT 
BUT ON MY BIRTHDAY I'VE BEEN THINKING OF LIKE 
MAYBE GOING TO THE TRAFFORD CENTRE AGAIN REMEMBER I USED TO GO THERE 
OH YEAH 
I'VE NEVER HAD ANY IN DEPTH DISCUSSION ABOUT THE TRAGEDY WITH HER 
SHE WAS A YOUNG CHILD WHEN THIS ALL HAPPENED 
AS SHE CAME OUT OF IT 
SHE JUST WANTED TO PUT IT BEHIND HER AND GET ON WITH HER LIFE 
NOW SHE'S A LOT OLDER 
AND I DID WONDER WHETHER THE TIME WOULD COME 
SHE HAS FOR EXAMPLE READ THE BOOK 
SHE WAS NOT BOTHERED IT WAS TOO LONG AND BORING 
TO READ MY BOOK ABOUT THE WHOLE TERRIBLE TIME 
SO MAYBE SHE IS TRYING TO ENQUIRE A LITTLE BIT 
AS WE ALL DO AS WE GET OLDER ABOUT WHY THESE THINGS HAPPEN 
I'VE BEEN READING SHAUN'S BOOK TO FIND OUT THINGS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW 
ABOUT HOW SHAUN AND OTHER PEOPLE CARED FOR ME AFTER THE ATTACK 
IT'S WEIRD I CAN'T REMEMBER LOADS ABOUT EITHER OF THEM 
IT'S MOSTLY JUST PHOTOS 
AND IT'S LIKE I WANT TO GO BACK TO BE SEVEN 
BECAUSE MEGAN AND LIN WAS ALIVE THEN AND I WAS REALLY HAPPY 
FOLLOWING THE ATTACK JOSIE'S LIFE WAS CHANGED FOR EVER 
SHE WAS BROUGHT HERE TO KING'S COLLEGE HOSPITAL LONDON 
HER HORRIFIC HEAD INJURIES HAD CAUSED SEVERE BRAIN DAMAGE 
THE DOCTORS HAD GRAVE CONCERNS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT 
SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE AN INDEPENDENT LIFE IN THE FUTURE 
NOW SHE HAS RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL FOR THE FIRST TIME 
TO MEET DOCTOR MARION CROUCHMAN 
WHO LED THE TEAM OF SPECIALISTS IN JOSIE'S RECOVERY 
JOSIE I WOULDN'T HAVE RECOGNISED YOU I DON'T THINK 
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER SINCE JOSIE LEFT THE HOSPITAL 
AS A FRAGILE NINE YEAR OLD WHO COULDN'T SPEAK 
AND WHOSE FUTURE WAS VERY UNCERTAIN 
SO ARE YOU UP TO LOOKING AROUND YEAH YEAH SURE 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME TO LET ME KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED 
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME 
AND WHY I CAN'T LIKE DO SPELLING AND WRITE ESSAYS AS MUCH NOW 
COS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER 
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND AND THAT 
BUT NOW I'M TWENTY ALMOST TWENTY ONE 
I SHOULD KNOW AND I UNDERSTAND WHY THINGS ARE LIKE THAT 
I FIRST SAW JOSIE THE MORNING OF HER OPERATION 
SHE WAS 
I SUPPOSE A WIRY LITTLE EIGHT OR NINE YEAR OLD 
I WAS SPECIFICALLY ASKED TO LOOK AT HER NECK 
THE BACK OF HER HEAD SHE HAD A NUMBER OF WOUNDS FROM THE INSTRUMENT 
THAT HAD BEEN USED TO HIT HER 
NOW THIS JUST A CAT SCAN 
JOSIE HAD BEEN STRUCK REPEATEDLY WITH A METAL HAMMER AND HAD SUSTAINED A LARGE OPEN WOUND 
DOCTORS EVENTUALLY INSERTED A FOUR INCH TITANIUM PLATE TO REBUILD HER SKULL 
THE BLOW TO THE HEAD AFFECTED THE EXACT PART OF THE BRAIN CONTROLLING HER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE 
YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS AREA HERE IS NOT THE SAME AS THAT SIDE YEAH 
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT CHANGE THERE ISN'T PRESENT HERE 
IT'S NOT THERE IT'S THERE BUT IT'S NOT THERE 
AND HERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE YOU SEE WHERE THE BLACK IS 
YEAH THAT'S FLUID 
IT'S A RELATIVELY LARGE AREA 
AND IT'S SLAP OVER WHERE YOUR SPEECH AND LANGUAGE AREA WAS 
SO YOU KNOW AT THE BACK OF MY HEAD I HAD A SCAR THERE 
WAS THAT JUST YOU HAD 
BECAUSE I EXAMINED YOU THE MORNING AFTER YOU CAME IN 
AND TOOK YOUR BANDAGES OFF AND YOU HAD A NUMBER OF 
YOU'D OBVIOUSLY HAD BLOWS TO THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD YEAH 
SEVERAL BUT 
AND YOU WERE LUCKY BECAUSE THERE IS QUITE AN IMPORTANT ARTERY 
IN THAT REGION AND IF YOU HAD 
BROKEN THAT ARTERY YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED 
UNTIL THEY FOUND YOU 
JOSIE SPENT SIX WEEKS AT KING'S COLLEGE HOSPITAL 
WHEN SHE FINALLY REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS 
SHE COULDN'T SPEAK AND WAS EXTREMELY DISTRESSED 
WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED A CHILD IN THAT SITUATION 
TO HAVE THAT PERIOD OF AGITATION 
BUT USUALLY IT SETTLES DOWN AS SOON AS THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS EMERGES 
BUT JOSIE REMAINED VERY VERY DISTRESSED AND VERY HYPERACTIVE 
WE WERE REALLY CONCERNED THAT THE MAIN CAUSE OF HER AGITATION 
WAS THE FACT THAT SHE HAD SOME MEMORY 
THAT SHE'D HAD A VERY VERY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE 
BUT THAT SHE WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE SENSE OF THAT 
SHE WASN'T ABLE TO ASK HER FATHER ABOUT IT 
SHE WASN'T ABLE TO VERBALISE HER DISTRESS 
AND I THINK THAT SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME WAS 
FOR HER MOTHER AND HER SISTER 
AND AFTER DISCUSSION WE DECIDED THAT SHAUN WOULD TELL HER 
SHE RESPONDED BY JUST TURNING HER FACE AWAY FROM HIM 
THE NEWS OF HER MOTHER AND SISTER'S DEATH INTENSIFIED JOSIE'S AGITATION 
AND THERE WERE LONG PERIODS OF ANXIETY 
THE NEARBY PARK OFFERED HER AN ESCAPE FROM THE HOSPITAL 
SQUIRREL THERE USED TO BE LOADS OF SQUIRRELS I REMEMBER THAT 
I LIKED COMING TO THE PARK AND PLACES 
COS IT WAS NOT IN THE HOSPITAL AND IT WAS SOMEWHERE 
WHERE EVERYBODY GOES PEOPLE THAT ISN'T ILL OR ANYTHING 
SO I JUST LOOKED LIKE A NORMAL GIRL WITH NOTHING WRONG WITH ME SORT OF 
BUT PROBABLY EVERYBODY KNEW WHO I WAS WHEN I WALKED PAST 
I REMEMBER THESE SWINGS I THINK 
QUITE WELL COS I REMEMBER THERE WAS QUITE A FEW SWINGS 
THERE'S LOADS HERE AND SHAUN USED TO SIT NEXT TO ME 
THE PARK GAVE JOSIE SOME MUCH NEEDED NORMALITY AT THIS POINT 
BUT THERE WAS GRAVE CONCERN FOR HER SAFETY 
AS THE KILLER WAS STILL AT LARGE 
THERE WAS SOME SOME MEN CAME OVER I THINK TO US 
I WAS SCARED I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG 
I RAN OFF WITH THE POLICE OFFICERS AND SHAUN TALKED TO THEM 
THEY WERE JUST SOME REPORTERS PROBABLY OR SOMETHING 
BUT IT'S QUITE FUNNY NOW THINKING BUT I WAS SCARED THEN 
I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH HOW YOUR LANGUAGE HAS COME BACK 
DO YOU THINK YOUR VOCABULARY IS AS BIG AS IT WOULD BE AT YOUR AGE 
HAVE YOU ANY FEEL FOR THAT 
NO I THINK MY LIKE WRITTEN WORK IS WELL BELOW MY TWENTY YEAR OLD AGE 
PROBABLY I DON'T KNOW THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN 
BUT YOU DON'T SPEAK LIKE A THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN YEAR OLD DO YOU NO 
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK 
IN YOUR MIND HOW OLD ARE YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT YOURSELF 
NO I ACT LIKE I'M TWENTY I DEFINITELY THINK 
I ACT MY AGE IT'S JUST MY WRITTEN WORK IS BELOW MY AGE PROBABLY 
WELL THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT YOUR MAIN PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE 
THAT JUST A LITTLE RESIDUAL DIFFICULTY WITH LANGUAGE 
BUT IT'S VERY VERY MINOR YEAH 
I'M GLAD TO SAY THAT SHE'S HANDLED IT VERY WELL 
SHE'S NOT REALLY CONSCIOUS OF IT 
WHICH IS KIND OF SOMETHING I WANTED TO PUSH 
DURING THE TIME THAT SHE WAS GROWING UP 
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY TO HER YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM 
I WANTED TO SAY YOU'RE AS GOOD AS ANYBODY ELSE 
YOU CAN DO AS LEAST AS WELL YOU KNOW 
TO KEEP THAT SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT AND TO PUSH HER ON 
I THINK IT'S QUITE EXTRAORDINARY SEEING HER TODAY 
I THOUGHT I WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH HER 
BUT THAT IT WOULD BECOME VERY RAPIDLY APPARENT 
THAT THERE WERE STILL QUITE MAJOR HOLES IN HER LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 
AND I'M VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED 
I THINK SOME DOCTORS AND PEOPLE ARE QUITE SURPRISED SORT OF 
HOW WELL I AM NOW 
THEY WANT TO KNOW MORE LIKE WHAT CAN I DO 
AND I DON'T MIND I LIKE TELLING THEM THAT I'M FINE 
AND THAT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME NOW OR ANYTHING 
JOSIE GRADUALLY BEGAN TO RECOVER GIVING THE POLICE HOPE 
THAT SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP THEM CATCH THE KILLER 
JOSIE'S GOOD PROGRESS MEANT THAT THE INVESTIGATING TEAM WERE HOPING 
TO BEGIN ASKING HER QUESTIONS SOON 
ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THE MURDER SCENE 
IT WAS STILL UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT JOSIE REMEMBERED ANYTHING AT ALL 
ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAD LED TO HER HEAD INJURY 
JOSIE WAS MATCHING WORDS WITH PICTURES IN HER THERAPY SESSIONS 
AND THIS GAVE THE POLICE FRESH HOPE 
THAT SHE COULD HELP THEM WITH THEIR ENQUIRIES 
TWO POLICE OFFERS HAD BEEN SPECIALLY ASSIGNED TO SUPPORT SHAUN FROM THE ONSET 
BUT NOW THEY HAD TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO JOSIE 
PAULINE HOBSON SMITH AND EDWIN TINGLEY SPENT MANY HOURS WORKING WITH HER 
AND THEY'VE REMAINED IN CONTACT EVER SINCE 
HELLO HELLO LOVELY TO SEE YOU 
HOW ARE YOU BRILLIANT TO SEE YOU YOU WAS NEVER THAT HEIGHT 
YOU WAS DOWN THERE 
YOU'RE TALLER THAN PAULINE NOW 
THE MAIN CHALLENGE FOR ED AND PAULINE WAS ENORMOUS 
HOW TO GATHER EVIDENCE FROM A TRAUMATISED CHILD WHO COULDN'T SPEAK 
WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW YOU WERE GOING TO BE 
WHETHER YOU WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK 
IN THOSE EARLY DAYS 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER BUT YOU COULDN'T SAY A WORD I KNOW 
WELL I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER THAT I COULDN'T TALK THAT MUCH 
I WAS THINKING LIKE DID I HELP YOU WITH 
OH YOU WERE MARVELLOUS EVEN THOUGH I COULDN'T TALK 
YOU WERE FANTASTIC AND IT WAS 
IT WAS REALLY UP TO US WASN'T IT TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT OF YOU 
GRADUALLY AS JOSIE WAS GAINING MORE STRENGTH YOU KNOW 
AND SHE STARTED MOVING ABOUT AND GETTING UP 
AND WE REALISED THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING HERE 
SHE MIGHT REMEMBER SOMETHING 
WHEN YOU HAVE A MURDER SCENE AS SUCH 
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THERE 
BUT SOMETIMES AN EXPLANATION TO WHAT IT'S DOING THERE IS REALLY IMPORTANT 
GENERALLY YOU'VE GOT NO WITNESS FOR THAT BUT WITH JOSIE WE DID HAVE A WITNESS 
I REALLY REMEMBER YOU WERE QUITE UPSET AND WORRIED 
YOU'D TRY TO GET OUT OF THE HOSPITAL WARDS 
YOU REALLY WOULD RUN TO THE DOOR AND TRY AND GET OUT 
IT WAS A MEDICAL NEED IN A WAY 
BECAUSE ALL THE WHILE SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL WARD 
SHE WAS ALMOST TRAPPED THERE AND CLEARLY SHE NEEDED TO GET OUT 
SHE HAD TO GO HOME SHE HAD TO PROVE TO HERSELF 
THAT LIN WASN'T THERE AND THAT MEGAN WASN'T THERE 
SHE WENT AROUND EACH ROOM 
MAKING SURE IN HER OWN MIND THAT THEY HAD GONE 
AND IT WAS QUITE DISTRESSING ACTUALLY 
WITHOUT GOING TO DEEPLY INTO IT SHE WAS REALLY DISTRESSED ABOUT THAT 
IT WAS A UNIQUE AND DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR ED AND PAULINE 
BUT THROUGH GROUNDBREAKING TECHNIQUES 
THEY EVENTUALLY HELPED JOSIE TO PIECE TOGETHER WHAT HAPPENED 
SHE TOLD THEM DETAILS OF THE ATTACK 
THAT SHE HAS NEVER FELT ABLE TO SHARE WITH ANYONE ELSE 
WE ACTUALLY PUSHED THE GUIDELINES QUITE A BIT 
AND WE WONDERED HOW WE WERE EXPECTED TO TALK TO HER 
GET THAT INFORMATION OUT OF HER 
WE WERE ADVISED AT ONE POINT TO GIVE JOSIE A PENCIL AND A PAPER 
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS BY THAT TIME WE KNEW 
JOSIE COULDN'T EVEN HOLD A PENCIL LET ALONE WRITE ANYTHING DOWN 
SO OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS A LOT THAT SHE STILL HAD TO TELL US 
ALTHOUGH SHE COULDN'T SPEAK TO US SHE WAS SAYING THE ODD THING 
I THOUGHT ABOUT MAKING SOME MODELS FOR HER 
AND IT WAS A BIT BIZARRE MAKING MODELS OF A MURDER SCENE 
BUT I DID ACTUALLY MAKE LITTLE MODELS 
AND I DRESSED THEM IN THE SAME TYPE OF CLOTHING AND COLOURING 
THAT LIN WAS WEARING 
AND THE TWO CHILDREN I DRESSED IN A LITTLE SCHOOL UNIFORM 
IT WAS FROM THAT THAT JOSIE WAS ABLE TO MOVE THE MODELS AROUND AND 
MY GUESS IS AND TALKING TO HER 
SHE THINKS SHE WAS KIND OF ENJOYING DOING THAT 
SHE WAS ABLE TO SHOW US ACTUALLY WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THAT TIME 
AND SHE DID WORK US RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH IT ALL 
WE WERE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE EFFECT THIS MIGHT HAVE ON HER 
HOWEVER AT THE COMPLETION OF THE FIRST TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS 
SHE WAS QUITE ELATED BY HAVING TO TELL US 
GET IT OFF HER CHEST PERHAPS 
DID I HAVE TO TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED 
DID THAT HELP LOADS LIKE 
YEAH IT DID LIKE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
BASICALLY WE WERE LOOKING AT A MURDER SCENE WEREN'T WE 
AND BASICALLY ALL YOU HAVE IN A MURDER SCENE 
IS JUST COLD EVIDENCE AND NOTHING THERE 
BUT BECAUSE YOU WERE THE JEWEL IN OUR CROWN IN A WAY 
BECAUSE YOU WERE ABLE TO TELL US WHAT TOOK PLACE 
IN THE SEQUENCE IT TOOK PLACE 
AND REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS 
SO YES YOU DID REALLY WELL WITH THAT 
AND DON'T EVER FEAR YOU DIDN'T 
JOSIE'S EVIDENCE WAS CRUCIAL TO THE INVESTIGATION 
AND EVENTUALLY MICHAEL STONE WAS CHARGED WITH THE MURDERS 
OF LIN AND MEGAN AND THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF JOSIE 
HAS WHAT WE DID HELPED YOU TO THE LOVELY POSITION YOU'RE IN NOW 
PROBABLY DID LOTS BECAUSE 
I DIDN'T REALLY SPEAK TO ANYBODY ELSE ABOUT LIKE BEFORE 
THE PAST AND WHAT HAPPENED NO 
SO PROBABLY WHEN I WAS AT THAT AGE I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT IT 
AND SO I'D LIKE DONE IT SPOKEN TO YOU ABOUT IT 
AND THEN DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT ANY MORE TO ANYBODY ELSE PROBABLY 
EVEN WHEN SHAUN WOULD TURN UP YOU'D CLAM UP AND NOT SAY ANYTHING 
YOU NEVER SPOKE TO SHAUN ABOUT IT IT STILL REMAINS THE SAME 
YOU STILL DON'T TALK ABOUT IT TO ANYBODY ELSE NO 
PROBABLY FEEL QUITE PRIVILEGED ABOUT THAT PAULINE 
IT REALLY WAS FANTASTIC TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU 
AND TO SEE HOW YOU REALLY BLOSSOMED 
KNOWING THAT JOSIE HASN'T SPOKEN TO ANYBODY ELSE 
OTHER THAN ED AND MYSELF ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT DAY 
FOR HER TO WANT TO FIND OUT IS QUITE AMAZING 
I SUPPOSE THAT'S SHOWING HER MATURITY REALLY 
IT'S WANTING TO KNOW WHY THIS HAPPENED 
A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE ATTACK SHAUN AND JOSIE MOVED BACK TO NORTH WALES 
FAR AWAY FROM THE PAINFUL MEMORIES OF KENT 
WHEN THEY RETURNED JOSIE WAS STILL NOT SPEAKING 
AND HER FATHER CONCERNED ABOUT HER EDUCATION AND WELFARE 
APPROACHED THE LOCAL SCHOOL SEEKING SUPPORT TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES 
I TOLD THEM I WAS THINKING ABOUT COMING BACK TO WALES TO LIVE 
I COULD SENSE THEIR DEPTH OF FEELING 
AS THEY OFFERED TO HAVE JOSIE BACK AT ANY TIME 
AS THEY MADE THIS OFFER I FELT A GREAT WEIGHT LIFTED OFF ME 
I COULD SEE JOSIE PLAYING HAPPILY WITH HER FRIENDS 
AND BEHIND THE MAJESTIC BULK OF SNOWDON MOUNTAIN 
RISING ABOVE THE WATERS OF LLYN NANTLLE 
BACK WITH HER OLD SCHOOL FRIENDS IN THIS WONDERFUL ENVIRONMENT 
WITH HER LOVING AND DEDICATED TEACHERS 
SURELY THAT WOULD GIVE JOSIE HER BEST CHANCE 
OF A SECURE AND STABLE RECOVERY 
I WAS GOING TO BRING JOSIE BACK TO LIVE AND GO TO SCHOOL AGAIN 
IN THE NANTLLE VALLEY 
IT WAS REALLY GOOD THAT SHAUN BROUGHT ME BACK TO NORTH WALES 
BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HAPPY THERE 
AND IT WAS A LOVELY PLACE TO GROW UP 
IF I'D STAYED IN KENT I WOULD HATE IT 
AND IT WOULD GIVE ME TOO MANY MEMORIES 
AND SO WHEN I CAME BACK TO NORTH WALES 
MY FRIENDS WERE THERE AND EVEN THOUGH I COULDN'T TALK MUCH 
I JUST SETTLED IN REALLY GOOD ANYWAY 
NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR 
THE LOCAL SCHOOL HAD NO EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH A CHILD 
WHO HAD SUFFERED SUCH BRAIN DAMAGE 
YET THEY PLAYED A KEY PART IN JOSIE'S RECOVERY 
BUT JOSIE WOULD HAVE TO TRY TO RECOVER 
IN THE FULL GLARE OF THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT 
IT WAS AN ADDED PRESSURE AS EVERY SMALL DETAIL OF HER PROGRESS WAS SEIZED UPON BY THE PRESS 
WHEN JOSIE CAME BACK TO THE SCHOOL THE INVESTIGATION WAS STILL GOING 
SO THERE WAS HIGH SECURITY 
NO REPORTERS OR ANYONE WAS ALLOWED 
TO PASS THE FRONT GATES OF THE SCHOOL 
THIS ZONE WAS JUST JOSIE'S SAFE ZONE 
SHAUN BROUGHT JOSIE TO SCHOOL 
SO THERE WERE A LOT OF REPORTERS AT THE BEGINNING 
BUT THEY KNEW THEY COULDN'T STEP ON TO THE SCHOOL PREMISES AT ALL 
CATHERINE WILLIAMS WAS APPOINTED JOSIE'S PERSONAL TUTOR 
SHE WOULD STAY WITH JOSIE UNTIL SHE LEFT SCHOOL AT SEVENTEEN 
WE WERE BRIEFED ON HOW MUCH DAMAGE THERE WAS 
JOSIE'S HEAD INJURY WAS SEVERE 
ERM NOBODY I DON'T THINK REALISES HOW BAD IT WAS 
I DON'T THINK JOSIE TO THIS DAY KNOWS HOW BAD SHE WAS THEN 
THERE'S A PICTURE OF MEGAN WORKING WITH THE CLAY 
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE IN HERE 
SHE HAD THIS FANTASTIC SMILE THAT SMILE HID A LOT OF THINGS FOR JOSIE 
UNFORTUNATELY SHE COULDN'T SPEAK THAT MUCH 
SHE'D POINT TO THINGS BUT SHE'D GET FRUSTRATED WITH HERSELF 
IT WAS A LONG AND COMPLEX PROCESS 
GOING BACK TO THE VERY BASICS OF TEACHING A CHILD IN THE EARLY STAGES OF LEARNING 
DO YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT WORK DID I NEED THE MOST HELP FOR 
PEOPLE USED TO SAY THINGS LIKE THAT'S BEHIND SOMETHING 
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW BEHIND OR ON OR UNDERNEATH AND STUFF 
SO WE'D HAVE TO WORK ON THAT SO YOU KNEW WHAT THEY MEANT 
YEAH I SORT OF REMEMBER WHAT WE DID 
AND CARD GAMES AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND READING 
JOSIE MADE STEADY PROGRESS BUT DOUBTS REMAINED 
ABOUT HOW FAR SHE COULD RECOVER AND WHAT FUTURE SHE COULD HOPE FOR 
I'VE BROUGHT A PICTURE WITH ME 
THIS IS THE DAY YOU CAME TO GET YOUR GCSE RESULTS YEAH 
I REMEMBER ALL THE NEWSPAPERS DID SAY 
JOSIE'S PASSED EIGHT GCSES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S RIGHT YEAH 
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE THAT BIG A DEAL FOR THAT BUT 
OH YEAH DEFINITELY 
AND JUST BEFORE YOU MOVED TO KENT 
I REMEMBER WE WERE MAKING A THEME ON CHAPELS 
AND MEGAN BROUGHT THIS CHAPEL THAT SHE'D MADE AT HOME TO SCHOOL 
AND IT'S BEEN ON THAT SHELF SINCE THEN YEAH AWW 
IT'S WEIRD SEEING MEGAN'S LITTLE MODEL ON THE WINDOW SILL IN SCHOOL 
I CAN'T REMEMBER THAT MUCH OF MEGAN IN SCHOOL OR ANYTHING 
BUT I REMEMBER PLAYING WITH HER AT HOME LIKE 
PLAYING WITH DOLLS AND PLAYING OUTSIDE 
I TALK TO FRIENDS OPENLY 
SAYING LIKE I WONDER HOW MEGAN WOULD BE LIKE NOW COS SHE'D BE NINETEEN 
AND 
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT COS IT'D BE WEIRD 
BUT WE USED TO MOSTLY LIKE THE SAME THINGS 
BUT WE DID HAVE OUR OWN FRIENDS 
I THINK MEGAN WAS MORE LIKE SHAUN 
AND I WAS A BIT MORE LIKE LIN 
BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE IT'S JUST THINGS THAT I THINK I CAN REMEMBER 
IT'S NICE BEING BACK IN YSGOL BALADEULYN 
IT HASN'T CHANGED THAT MUCH 
BUT I REMEMBER I USED TO BE REALLY HAPPY THERE 
THERE WERE OF COURSE MANY MILESTONES 
MANY STAGES THAT SHE WENT THROUGH 
AND I HAVE TO SAY REALLY LOOKING BACK 
APART FROM THE SORT OF LOW POINT 
OF JOSIE'S HOSPITAL OPERATIONS 
WHICH WERE WHERE SHE WAS MOST DISTRAUGHT 
AND WERE MOST UPSETTING FOR US 
THE OTHER MILESTONES HAVE BEEN HIGH POINTS 
IN THE SENSE OF HER ACHIEVING AT SCHOOL 
MANAGING TO GET GCSES GETTING INTO COLLEGE 
GETTING MERITS AND DISTINCTIONS IN THE WORK SHE'S DOING NOW 
BASICALLY BEING HAPPY 
FOR JOSIE THAT HAPPINESS HAS BEEN UNDERLINED 
BY MEETING HER BOYFRIEND I. WAN 
IN THE EARLY DAYS IT WAS UNCERTAIN WHETHER SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN A RELATIONSHIP 
HE'S NOT USUALLY MY TYPE 
BUT I THOUGHT HE LOOKED QUITE GOOD LOOKING AND DIFFERENT SO 
I KNOW HIM LIKE LOADS 
AND EVEN WHEN I FIRST MET HIM 
I SOMEHOW JUST GOT ON WITH HIM REALLY WELL 
JUST LIKE CLICKED 
WHEN I FIRST MET JOSIE I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HER 
OR ABOUT HER PAST OR WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER 
BUT A FEW WEEKS AFTERWARDS 
I MENTIONED TO MY DAD THAT I WAS GOING OUT 
WITH A GIRL FROM TAN Y. R. ALLT WHO WAS CALLED JOSIE 
AND HE SORT OF PUT IT TOGETHER 
AND THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT I REALISED WHO SHE WAS 
HE ASKED LIKE ABOUT LIN MY MUM AND THAT 
AND I JUST TOLD HIM THAT 
WELL MY MUM AND SISTER GOT KILLED DIED 
YEARS AGO AND I'D LIKE GOT HURT 
BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY SAY ANYTHING ELSE AFTER THAT AT ALL 
IT'S GOOD LIKE THAT BECAUSE HE JUST LIKES ME 
AS ANY OTHER LIKE NORMAL GIRL AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
SO IT'S GOOD 
I THINK SHE'S BEEN A VERY NORMAL ORDINARY 
AVERAGE TEENAGER IN THE WAY THAT SHE'S BUILT HER RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE 
SHE'S DONE ALL THE THINGS OF DISCOVERING 
ALCOHOL AND FASHION AND ALL THOSE THINGS 
THAT TEENAGERS DABBLE WITH AND MESS AROUND AT 
AND PARTYING AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF 
BUT THE ONE THING THAT PERHAPS WORRIED ME MORE THAN ANYTHING 
ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE WAS 
WAS I DOING THE RIGHT THING BY JOSIE TO KIND OF 
SAY YES TO THE MEDIA INTRUSION ON SO MANY OCCASIONS 
IT KIND OF SNOWBALLED FROM THE BEGINNING 
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN HUGE MEDIA INTEREST IN JOSIE 
A BEAUTIFUL GIRL WHO SURVIVED AGAINST ALL THE ODDS 
AND SOUGHT TO RECOVER UNDER THE GLARE OF THE CAMERAS 
BUT IN THOSE EARLY DAYS JOSIE HATED THE PUBLICITY 
SHE AND HER FATHER HAVE NEVER DISCUSSED THE RESENTMENT 
AND FRUSTRATION SHE FELT 
I REMEMBER THE SUN I THINK IT WAS I'M NOT SURE SAID SOMETHING REALLY NOT TRUE 
AND I GOT REALLY ANNOYED I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS 
BUT I REMEMBER I SAID I'M NEVER GOING TO GO IN THAT NEWSPAPER AGAIN I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS 
IT WAS USUALLY JUST PEOPLE TRYING TO TELL THE STORY THEY WANTED TO MAKE IT 
OVERLY ROMANTICISED YEAH OVERLY 
SENTIMENTAL IF YOU LIKE 
I THINK A LOT OF ANY MEDIA AND THAT THEY ALL WANT ME TO BE SORT OF SAD AND THAT 
BUT I'M NOT I THINK A LOT OF THEM WANT ME TO MAKE A LOT MORE EMOTION AND STUFF ABOUT THE PAST 
EVEN AT THE TIME OF THE FUNERAL YOU KNOW YOU WERE PHOTOGRAPHED 
THERE WERE PEOPLE LITERALLY LURKING BEHIND THE GRAVESTONES 
WITH LONG LENSES AT THE CEMETERY TO GET PICTURES OF YOU 
AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WERE COMING OR GOING 
AND YOU KNOW YOU'D BE SMILING AND LAUGHING ABOUT THINGS 
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS ARRIVE 
WHO YOU HADN'T SEEN FOR AGES 
AND SO THEN A PICTURE WOULD APPEAR IN THE PAPER OF YOU WITH A SMILE ON YOUR FACE 
MM H. M. M. 
BUT PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY IN THE SITUATION 
WHERE YOU WERE ACTUALLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A KIND OF HEAD INJURY DRUG 
AND THAT WAS CAUSING THAT 
I KNOW THAT THERE WAS SOME CRITICISM 
AND I DON'T LOOK BACK ON THAT WITH A PARTICULAR FEELING OF HAPPINESS 
IT STARTED WITH THE POLICE WHO SAID WE NEED TO USE THE MEDIA IN THIS CASE 
IT ALSO GREW OUT OF THE FACT THAT I WANTED TO LEAVE THE AREA 
WHERE THE MURDERS HAD TAKEN PLACE AND BRING JOSIE BACK HERE TO WALES 
CAMERAS CLICK 
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE A JOB TO COME BACK TO 
AND THEREFORE LITERALLY TO MAKE ENDS MEET I NEEDED TO EARN MONEY 
SO FOR BETTER OR WORSE I KIND OF AGREED TO WORK WITH THE MEDIA 
I PERHAPS DID LET IT GO TOO FAR AND I'M NOT PROUD OF THAT 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
BUT TODAY JOSIE HAS A MORE COMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MEDIA 
IT BEGAN WHEN SHE REALISED HOW SHE COULD USE HER PROFILE TO PUBLICISE OTHER PEOPLE'S SUFFERING 
THAT'S GREAT 
THAT'S GREAT FINE 
ON THIS TRIP SHE HAS TRAVELLED TO NIGERIA TO OPEN A MEDICAL CENTRE FOR CHILDREN AFFECTED BY MALARIA 
I DON'T WANT TO BE YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE I'M JOSIE RUSSELL 
WHERE PEOPLE SAY OH POOR JOSIE RUSSELL ARE YOU BETTER AND STUFF 
I JUST WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND GIVE SOMETHING BACK TO PEOPLE 
WHO ARE LESS FORTUNATE IN SOME WAYS' 
IT MAKES ME THINK LIKE JUST HOW EVERYBODY 
ELSE FEELS LOSING THEIR FAMILY 
IT'S NOT JUST ME THAT'S LOST FAMILY IT'S THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE 
OVER THE YEARS JOSIE AND SHAUN HAVE SUPPORTED OVERSEAS CHARITIES TOGETHER 
BUT AS SHE GAINS IN CONFIDENCE SHE HAS ACCEPTED THIS INVITATION WITHOUT HER FATHER 
I THINK SHE FEELS QUITE GOOD ABOUT THE FACT SHE CAN HANDLE THIS ON HER OWN 
AND DOESN'T NEED DAD ALONG ANY LONGER 
AND SHE CAN DO IT HER WAY NOW 
SHE'S AGREED TO DO THIS WORK FOR THE CHARITIES 
BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES IN WHAT THOSE CHARITIES ARE DOING AND WHAT THEY STAND FOR 
THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS VISIT TO NIGERIA IS THE OFFICIAL OPENING 
OF THE JOSIE RUSSELL CHILDREN'S HEALTH CENTRE 
THIS TRIP WAS REALLY DIFFERENT THAN OTHER TRIPS 
BECAUSE I WAS ON MY OWN AND SHAUN'S NOT WITH ME 
GOING ON MY OWN THIS TIME DOES MAKE IT DIFFERENT BUT GOOD 
BECAUSE HE'S NEVER BEEN TO NIGERIA AND I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN HIM 
AND JUST I HOPE THAT HE'S PROUD OF ME DOING SOMETHING ON MY OWN 
IT'S A REALLY REALLY FANTASTIC THING THAT'S HAPPENING 
AND IT SHOULD SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES 
WHICH IS LIKE AMAZING 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME BACK YUP COME BACK NEXT YEAR UH COME BACK NEXT YEAR 
O. K. NEXT YEAR HOPE SO 
TO THINK THAT JOSIE WHO I'D ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS A CHILD 
OBVIOUSLY MY CHILD WAS SUDDENLY GOING OFF INTO THE BIG WORLD 
AND HAVING TO LOOK AFTER HERSELF 
AND ALSO THE FACT THAT SHE'S GONNA BE ON HER OWN 
WALKING ABOUT ON HER OWN 
GOING TO COLLEGE GOING TO HER PART TIME JOB ON HER OWN 
SO THESE THINGS ALWAYS GO THROUGH YOUR MIND IF YOU'RE A PARENT 
SHE SAYS SHE CAN HANDLE HERSELF 
I'VE ALWAYS JUST TRIED TO BE AS OPEN 
BUT IN A RELAXED WAY SAY TO HER WELL DO TAKE CARE 
AND ALL THE NORMAL SAFETY ASPECTS 
I'VE NOT TRIED TO SHIELD HER OBVIOUSLY SHE'S BEEN EXPOSED TO 
SOME OF THE SORT OF WORST THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYBODY 
EVEN NOW TWELVE YEARS ON JOSIE AND SHAUN HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE 
TO FIND CLOSURE FOR THIS HORRIFIC EPISODE IN THEIR LIVES 
MICHAEL STONE HAS ALWAYS DENIED THE MURDER OF LIN AND MEGAN AND THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF JOSIE 
HE'S NOW AWAITING LEAVE TO APPEAL AGAINST THE CONVICTION FOR THE THIRD TIME 
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS WORRY THAT 
ARE WE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SURE WHETHER HE DID IT OR NOT FOR A START YEAH 
EXACTLY UM 
AND BUT IF YOU JUST ACCEPT WHAT A COUPLE OF JURIES AND APPEALS HAVE ALREADY DECIDED 
OF COURSE THERE WOULD BE WORRIES THERE 
M. M. M. 
SO IT'S DIFFICULT COS YOU CAN NEVER GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY YOU NEVER CAN GET IT FINISHED WITH YOU KNOW 
NO YEAH 
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT NOW 
IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD FILLING IN THE GAPS AND MEETING ALL THE PEOPLE 
LIKE THE DOCTOR AND ED AND PAULINE 
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO TO KENT AGAIN OR TALK ABOUT MICHAEL STONE 
COS THERE'S NO POINT 
THE ONLY THING I DO THINK ABOUT MAYBE IS WHY DID HE DO IT IF HE DID 
I JUST WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE GOOD MEMORIES OF LIN AND MEGAN 
AND MOSTLY ABOUT THE FUTURE AND NOW 
I NEVER DOUBTED THE FACT THAT SHE WOULD RECOVER SHE WAS A VERY STRONG PERSONALITY ANYWAY 
AND THAT'S WHY SHE DID SURVIVE 
I'M STILL PRETTY IMPRESSED ACTUALLY HOW SHE IS NOW 
BECAUSE I STILL THOUGHT THERE'D BE CERTAIN PROBLEMS SHE'D BE GOING THROUGH 
WITH TALKING TO ME EVEN BUT NO REALLY IMPRESSED WITH HER YEAH VERY PROUD 
WELL DONE HOORAY 
YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE THAT'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH JOSIE ALL THOSE YEARS 
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO SEE HOW JOSIE'S COME ON HOW TERRIFIC FOR ME AND ED TO SEE 
THIS YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS IN THOSE EARLY HOURS JUST LYING THERE 
NOT KNOWING IF SHE WAS GOING TO LIVE OR DIE 
I THINK REACHING TWENTY ONE IS EXCITING BUT ALSO IT'S QUITE SCARY 
BECAUSE I'M IN MY LAST YEAR IN COLLEGE 
SO AFTER THAT I'VE GOT TO GO OUT THERE IN THE BIG WIDE WORLD AND GET A JOB AND EARN A LIVING LIKE 
MIGHT BE IF SHE SETTLED DOWN GOT MARRIED 
IF I KNEW SHE WAS WITH SOMEONE THAT COULD LOOK AFTER HER ALL THE TIME 
I'M SURE SHE'D SAY 
WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY TO LOOK AFTER MYSELF OR MY PARTNER IF I HAVE ONE SORT OF THING YOU KNOW 
SO IN THE FUTURE MAYBE I'LL WORRY LESS WHEN I SEE HER MORE SETTLED INTO THAT KIND OF A SITUATION 
TAKING THIS JOURNEY HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD AND I'VE LEARNT A LOT OF THINGS' 
EVEN THOUGH BAD AND SAD THINGS HAPPENED A LOT OF GOOD THINGS HAS COME OUT OF IT 
SO I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL SORRY FOR ME AND SAYING ARE YOU BETTER JOSIE OR ANYTHING 
COS I AM BETTER AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME 
SHE IS A SURVIVOR AND WILL MAKE THE BEST OF ANY SITUATION THAT MAY BEFALL HER IN HER LIFE TO COME 
AND I WILL ALWAYS BE PROUD AND HAPPY OF HER EVERY ACHIEVEMENT NO MATTER HOW LARGE OR SMALL 
WHEREVER HER JOURNEY MAY TAKE HER IN THE FUTURE 
JOSIE'S LIGHT WILL ALWAYS SUSTAIN HER 
BUT I PRAY THAT SHE WILL NEVER BE TESTED SO AGAIN 
THIS IS JOSIE SPEAKING AND I DON'T WANT TO BE FILMED AGAIN 
AND I JUST WANT TO BE NORMAL 
I DON'T WANT NO FILM PEOPLE TO COME AT ALL 
SO GOODBYE EVERYBODY
