BEIJING QUENTIN SOMMERVILLE 
HOW IS IT LOOKING THIS MORNING IS 
THERE ANY CHANCE THAT MORE PEOPLE 
WILL BE ABLE TO BE RESCUED NOW THAT 
THE WEATHER CONDITIONS HAVE BEGUN 
TO IMPROVE 
WELL THE GOOD NEWS IN ONE SENSE IS 
THAT THE CHINESE RESCUE SERVICES 
HAVE MANAGED TO GET INTO ONE OF THE 
MOST DIFFICULT AREAS RIGHT THE VERY 
EPICENTRE OF THE EARTHQUAKE WHICH 
IS DEEP IN THE SICHUAN MOUNTAINS 
IT HAD BEEN BLOCKED BY LANDSLIDES 
AND HELICOPTERS COULDN'T GET IN 
THERE NOW NUMBER OF TROOPS 
MANAGED TO GET IN THERE NOT MANY 
THEY WENT INTO ONE VILLAGE WHICH 
HAS A POPULATION OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND 
PEOPLE AND ONLY TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE 
SURVIVED AS THE TROOPS AND RESCUE 
WORKERS WERE WALKING THROUGH THEY 
COULD HEAR CRIES COMING FROM THE 
RUBBLE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE 
NECESSARY RESCUE TEAMS TO GET THE 
PEOPLE OUT NOW CHINA IS SENDING IN 
AS MANY PEOPLE IT CAN TO THAT AREA 
IT IS PARATROOPING PEOPLE IN AND

AND RYAN 
NICE TO MEET YOU GUYS 
IT IS GOING TO BE A LONG MORNING 
BUT JOIN US LATER ON 
AND YOU WILL HAVE LOST YOUR 
VOICE WITHIN AN HOUR 
HE DID ASK RANGERS FANS TO GO AND 
SAY HELLO HE WAS ASKING FOR IT 
MOST OF US ARE SATISFIED IT SEEMS 
WITH THE HOSPITAL CARE WE RECEIVE 
IN ENGLAND WE ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT 
CLEANLINESS THE QUALITY OF THE 
FOOD OR MIXED SEX WARDS 
THAT'S ACCORDING TO AN ANNUAL POLL 
OF OVER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PATIENTS ANNA 
WALKER IS FROM THE HEALTHCARE 
COMMISSION WHICH CARRIED OUT THE 
SURVEY THE HEALTHCARE COMMISSION 
IS INDEPENDENT ISN'T IT YES IT YES IT IS AN INDEPENDENT WATCHDOG YOU 
TALKED TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PATIENTS IT IS 
GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS ISN'T IT 
LET'S START WITH THE GOOD 
THE GOOD NEWS OVER NINETY PER CENT OF PATIENTS 
FEEL THAT THE CARE THEY GET WHEN 
THEY GO AND STAY IN HOSPITAL IS 
GOOD VERY GOOD OR EXCELLENT AND 
THE NUMBER WHO THINK IT IS 
EXCELLENT IS NOW FORTY TWO PER CENT SO THAT'S A 
RISING PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE GIVING 
TOP MARKS TO THEIR HOSPITAL FOR 
QUALITY OF CARE 
STILL CONCERNS THOUGH ONE ABOUT 
CLEANLINESS CLEANLINESS YES YES AND SECONDLY ABOUT MIXED SEX WARDS 
THE GOVERNMENT WERE SAYING THEY 
WERE GOING TO GET RID OF MIXED SEX 
WARDS AND THEY HAVEN'T 
ONE OF THE 
IMPORTANT THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE 
SURVEY IS THE LEVEL OF VARIATION 
YOU GET A LOT OF TOP PERFORMING 
HOSPITALS AND THEN YOU GET A LOT OF 
VERY POOR PERFORMERS AS WELL WE 
ARE PUBLISHING TODAY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME THE COMPLETE SET OF RESULTS 
SO ALL PATIENTS AND ALL TRUSTS CAN 
SEE HOW THEY ARE DOING AND IF I CAN 
TAKE SOME EXAMPLES IF YOU TAKE 
MIXED SEX ACCOMMODATION IN THE 
BEST PERFORMING HOSPITALS ONLY TWO PER CENT 
OR THREE PER CENT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THERE IS 
SOME FORM OF MIXED SEX 
ACCOMMODATION SHARING A MIXED BAY 
OR SHARING BATHROOM FACILITIES BUT 
IN SOME TRUSTS IT IS AS HIGH AS FORTY FIVE PER CENT 
OR ANOTHER EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE OLD 
YOU MAY NEED HELP WITH EATING IN 
SOME HOSPITALS MOST PEOPLE GET 
HELP ALL THE TIME BUT IN SOME FORTY FIVE PER CENT 
OF ELDERLY PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT 
THEY DID NOT GET THE HELP WITH FOOD 
WHEN THEY NEEDED IT 
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT 
YES YES WHY ARE THERE WIDE VARIATIONS IN 
HOSPITALS WHY DO YOU GET GET SUCH 
GOOD PERFORMING TRUSTS AND POOR 
PERFORMING TRUSTS AND HOW CAN YOU 
MAKE THE POOR ONES COME UP TO THE 
STANDARD OF THE GOOD ONES IS IT 
ABOUT MONEY 
NO THESE ARE BASICS 
OF CARE CLEANLINESS THE HELP WITH 
EATING WHEN YOU NEED THE FACT THAT 
SOME HOSPITALS CAN DO WELL IS ABOUT 
MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP IN THAT 
HOSPITAL SO WHAT WE ARE SAYING TO 
THE POOR PERFORMING TRUSTS 
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR PATIENTS ARE 
TELLING YOU YOU HAVE GOT A PROBLEM 
AND ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY ACROSS 
THAT HOSPITAL KNOWS WHAT THEY NEED 
TO DO DIFFERENTLY AND BEGIN FROM 
TODAY TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY 
HOW MANY HOSPITALS ARE FALLING INTO 
THAT CATEGORY WHERE YOU THINK THE 
MANAGEMENT REALLY DO NEED TO SORT 
OUT 
IT IS QUITE COMPLEX BECAUSE A OUT HOSPITAL CAN BE ONE GOOD PERFORMING 
IN ONE AREA AND FALL DOWN IN 
ANOTHER IT IS A COMPLEX 
PICTUREMENT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS GO 
BACK TO THE RESULTS IF YOU'RE IN 
THE BOTTOM CATEGORY ASK YOURSELF 
TODAY WHAT YOU CAN DO 
IF YOU ARE A 
PATIENT YOU CAN LOOK ON YOUR 
WEBSITE AND YOU CAN SEE THE POOR 
PERFORMERS 
THESE HOSPITALS HAVE PERFORMERS PATIENTS FORUMS AND WE HELP THE 
PATIENT FORUM WILL CAMPAIGN WITH 
THAT HOSPITAL FOR A CHANGE 
NITION NICE TO SEE YOU 
FUR TRYING TO LOWER YOUR BLOOD 
PRESSURE PRESSURE ACCORDING TO RESEARCH RESEARCH IT 
CAN BE REDUCED BY LISTENING TO HALF 
AN HOUR OF MUSIC 
BEFORE YOU GO RUSHING TO PUT YOUR 
FAVOURITE SEX PISTOLS C. D. ON IT 
ONLY APPLIES TO A REGULAR AND SLOW 
RETH M. THE TESTS WERE CLASSICAL 
INDIA RAGA AND CELTIC MUSIC 
HERE IS A SOOTHING SAMPLE FOR YOU 
I FEEL CALMER ALREADY 
DOCTOR ROSEMARY IS WITH US 
IT IS A NICE SOUND IS IT REALLY 
GOING TO LOWER OUR BLOOD PRESSURE 
YES THERE IS RESEARCH DONE BY THE 
UNIVERSITY OF FLORENCE AND IT HAS 
SHOWN THAT LISTENING TO HALF AN 
HOUR OF SLOW SOOTHING MUSIC WHICH 
IS NICE AND SLOW REALLY CAN 
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE YOUR BLOOD 
PRESSURE IF YOU HAVE SLIGHTLY 
RAISED BLOOD PRESSURE IT IS SUCH 
GOOD NEWS A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
GOT SLIGHTLY RAISED BLOOD PRESSURE 
DO NOT WANT TO BE TAKING TABLETS 
AND IT SHOWS THERE ARE THINGS YOU 
CAN DO 
DO YOU HAVE TO JUST LISTEN TO THE 
MUSIC AND NOTHING ELSE 
IN THIS RESEARCH THEY ALSO HAD THEM 
DOING SLOW ABDOMINAL EXERCISES 
JUST DEEP BREATHING IT IS NO GOOD 
LISTENING TO THE MUSIC AND DOING 
THE WASHING UP YOU HAVE TO STOP 
SLOW DOWN AND RELAX 
ABSORB IT ABSORB IT THEY COMPARED 
IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND THE PULSE 
RATES STAYED THE SAME OF BOTH 
GROUPS IT IS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS 
THE MUSIC AND NOT THE EXERCISES 
THAT WERE HAVING THE BENEFICIAL 
EFFECT EFFECT WHY 
WELL IT REDUCES YOUR STRESS WHY LEVELS YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL IT 
HAVING AN EFFECT COMING OVER YOU 
YOU SLOW DOWN DON YOU 
CAN WE HAVE 
A LITTLE BIT UNDER ROSEMARY AS WELL 
PRESUMABLY BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING 
THIS WON'T HAVE THE SAME EFFECT 
BUT HERE IT IS 
IS IT COMEING NO 
IT CAN BE CELTIC MUSIC THE 
RESEARCHERS USED INDIAN RAGA MUSIC 
AND CLASSICAL MUSIC 
HERE IS SOME INDIAN RAGA MUSIC 
NICE AND GENTLE YOU CAN CHOOSE 
YOUR FAVOURITE KIND OF MUSIC AS 
LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR BLOOD 
PRESSURE CHECKED THAT IS ALL YOU 
MAY NEED TO DO 
EVERY LITTLE BIT WOULD HELP 
YES HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DOES NOT 
GIVE YOU ANY SYMPTOMS PEOPLE WERE 
OFTEN RELUCTANT TO TAKE TABLETS FOR 
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT MAKING THEM 
FEEL ILL 
HOW ABOUT STROKING A CAT 
THAT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER AS LONG 
AS YOUR CAT IS NOT PUSHING YOUR 
FURNITURE PULLING YOUR FURNITURE 
TO BITS 
HE IS JUST LIKE MEDITATION 
HE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD FIND 
IT DIFFICULT TO SIT STILL AND 
MEDITATE BUT IF DOCTOR TELLS YOU 
TO PLUG YOURSELF INDIA AND P. THREE 
PLAYER AND LISTEN TO MUSIC FOR HALF 
AN HOUR A DAY YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE 
IS LIKELY TO BE LOWER M. P. THREE PLAYER 
WE ARE TALKING MORE SLOWLY THINGS 
HAVE CALMED DOWN THESE ARE OUR 
MAIN STORIES RESCUE WORKERS ARE A 
STRUGGLING TO REACH THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE COLLAPSED TRAPPED UNDER 
COLLAPSED BUILDINGS FOLLOWING THE 
CHINESE EARTHQUAKE TWELVE THOUSAND AND NOW 
KNOWN TO HAVE DIED 
GORDON BROWN WILL ANNOUNCE HIS

ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH INTO THE 
SOUTH WEST AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT 
SOME HIGH CLOUD AND SOME SUNSHINE 
SUNSHINE ACROSS MUCH OF WALES FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND A LOVELY START 
THE DAY THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
DAY YOU WILL FIND MUCH OF THE CLOUD 
WILL BURN BACK TO THE COAST IT

THE EAST ANGLIA AND THE MIDLANDS 
SOME OF THAT CLOUD WILL STICK 
ESPECIALLY EASTERN ENGLAND AND INTO 
EASTERN SCOTLAND TOP TEMPERATURES 
OF TWENTY TWO DEGREES CELSIUS THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON THERE IS THE RISK OF A 
SHOWER FROM HAMPSHIRE WEST 
WHATEVER RAIN PUSHERS STEADILY 
NORTHWARDS THROUGH THE COURSE OF 
TOMORROW THE RAIN BAND WILL SIT 
ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHERN ENGLAND 
WALES AND EAST ANGLIA THERE WILL 
BE SOME THUNDERY OUTBREAKS SOME 
PARTS COULD SEE MORE THAN AN INCH 
BEHIND IT SOME SHOWERS AHEAD OF 
IT QUITE A LOT OF CLOUD 
TEMPERATURES MUCH LOWER THAN WE 
HAVE BEEN USED TO SOME THINK WE'RE 
KEEPING A CLOSE IRELAND AT THE 
WEATHER CENTRE IS THAT SCENARIO 
THE BRISK OF SOME HEAVY RAIN COMING 
IN THROUGH THE COURSE OF TONIGHT 
THE RISK OF SOME HEAVY RAIN SOME 
PLACES COULD HAVE AS MUCH AS FIFTY ML 
M. M. ON FRIDAY THERE WILL STILL BE 
SOME RAIN IN THE SOUTH THAT WILL 
KIROV INTO THE NORTH SEA CLOUD 
SHOWERS AND SUNSHINE AT THE WEEKEND 
TOUGH TIMES FOR HOUSEBUILDERS 
HELLO DECLAN 
WE NOW KNOW WHAT TYPE OF ADVICE THE 
HOUSING MINISTER WAS GETTING AFTER 
BRIEFING PAPERS WERE SNAPPED BY 
PHOTOGRAPHERS IN DOWNING STREET 
ALL OF THE PAPERS HAVE GOT THE 
DETAILS OF THOSE DOCUMENTS SHE WAS 
CARRYING SHE HAS BEEN TOLD THAT 
HOUSE PRICES MAY FALL BY BETWEEN FIVE PER CENT 
AND TEN PER CENT THIS YEAR THE GOVERNMENT 
DOES NOT KNOW HOW BAD IT MAY GET 
IT ALSO SAYS THE NUMBER OF NEW 
HOMES BEING BUILT HAS FALLEN BY 
AROUND TEN PER CENT THAT IS HITTING THE 
BIG HOUSE BUILDERS SALES OF NEW 
HOMES ARE FALLING IT IS REPORTED 
IN THE TELEGRAPH THIS MORNING THAT 
HUNDREDS OF WORKERS HAVE BEEN LAID 
OFF I AM JOINED BY RICHARD DIMENT 
HE IS DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE 
FEDERATION OF SMALL BUILDERS YOU 
KNOW WHAT STATE THE HOUSING MARKET 
IS IN WHAT IS YOUR TAKE 
WE ARE SEEING LOT OF SQUEEZE IN 
THERE WE ARE SEEING MANY OF OUR 
MEMBERS FINDING WORK FALLING OFF ON 
THE MAJOR SITES WE ARE ALSO SEEING 
THE SLIGHTLY LARGER COMPANIES 
COMING DOWN AND DOING THE SMALLER 
DOMESTIC WORK AT THE SAME TIME OUR 
MEMBERS ARE BEING AFFECTED BADLY BY 
PEOPLE PUTTING OFF DISCRETIONARY 
IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR HOMES THEY 
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CURRENT 
DIFFICULTIES IN GETTING LOANS 
IT IS ALSO PEOPLE NOT BORROWING 
MONEY TO REPAIR THEIR HOUSES 
VERY MUCH SO THERE ARE NOT CERTAIN 
WHAT IS AROUND THE CORNER 
WHEN YOU SEE REPORTS THAT RED 
ROLE IS LAYING OFF HUNDREDS OF 
WORKERS DOES THAT SEND CHILL UP 
YOUR SPINE 
IT CERTAINLY WORRIES US VERY MUCH 
AT THE MOMENT THE INDUSTRY SEEMS TO 
BE JUST ABOUT HOLDING UP BUT 
EXPECTATIONS LATER IN THE YEAR AGO 
THAT THERE WILL BE FEWER JOB 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE 
PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WORKING AS 
SEMI SKILLED OR ON SKILLED PEOPLE 
UNSKILLED WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
THE FUTURE 
MORE AFTER SEVEN 
FLASHING COLOURED LIGHTS AND THE 
NIGHT SKY AND A LITTLE CAILEAN IN

PUBLIC BEFORE BUT NOW THE MOD IS 
OPENING UP ALL HIS FILES OVER THE 
LAST THIRTY YEARS AS THE ORIGINALS 
WERE CONTAMINATED WITH ASBESTOS 
THEY WERE COPIED ONTO THE INTERNET 
THE OUTSTANDING THING IS THAT IT 
BECOMES QUITE OBVIOUS THAT IT WILL 
ACTION WAS TAKEN ON THESE REPORTS 
YOU CAN ALMOST PUT YOURSELF IN THE 
SEAT OF THE DESK OFFICERS AT THE 
MINISTRY OF DEFENCE THEY MUST HAVE 
RECEIVED SCORES OF THESE REPORTS 
MONTH AFTER MONTH ON AVERAGE TWO HUNDRED 
TO THREE HUNDRED PER YEAR THEY DID NOT HAVE 
THE RESOURCES TO FOLLOW THEM ALL 
HE FERRAR IN THE FILES TO REPORT OF 
ENCOUNTERS WITH ALIENS THERE ARE

FIRST CHINA IS SENDING THOUSANDS 
OF OF FRA TROOPS TO BOOST THE 
RESCUE OPERATION IN SICHUAN 
ENTIRE TOWNS HAVE BEEN RAISED TO 
THE GROUND WITH NO HOUSES LEFT 
STANDING ACCORDING TO THE 
AUTHORITIES AT LEAST TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE 
ARE KNOWN TO HAVE DIED TENS OF 
THOUSANDS MORE ARE STILL MISSING 
INJURED BUT ALIVE A YOUNG 
SCHOOLGIRL IS BROUGHT OUT FROM THE 
RUBBLE RUBBLE SHE IS LUCKY TO HAVE SURVIVED 
THIS IS WHAT IS LEFT OF HER PRIMARY 
SCHOOL SCHOOL MANY OF HER FRIENDS DIDN'T MAKE IT 
OUTSIDE PARENTS WAIT 
DESPERATE FOR NEWS AT THIS SCHOOL 
TWELVE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN PULLED OUT 
ALIVE ALIVE THIS RESCUE WORKER EXPLAINS THAT 
SHE COULD HEAR THE VOICES OF 
CHILDREN THEY HAD BEEN TRYING TO 
GET OUT OF THE BUILDING WHEN IT 
COLLAPSED COLLAPSED UP UNTIL NOW RESCUE TEAMS HAVE 
BEEN WORKING UNDER APPALLING 
CONDITIONS TORRENTIAL RAIN HAS 
BEEN HAMPERING THEIR EFFORTS MANY 
ROADS ARE STILL DIFFICULT TO PASS 
BUT IT IS HOPED THAT BETTER WEATHER 
WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO GET AID TO 
THOSE WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT 
THE SURVIVORS FACE GRIM REALITY 
HOMELESS IN THE COLD AND WORRIED 
ABOUT AFTERSHOCKS 
THOUSANDS OF EXTRA TROOPS ARE GOING 
IN TODAY TWENTY THOUSAND ARE ALREADY OUT 
SEARCHING THEY KNOW TIME ISN'T ON 
THEIR SIDE 
LET'S GET MORE FROM OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IN BEIJING QUENTIN 
SOMMERVILLE IS IT THE CASE THAT 
THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES ARE 
UNCOVERING THE FULL SCALE OF THIS 
DISASTER 
ABSOLUTELY AND WE HAVE DISASTER JUST HEARD THAT THEY ARE GOING TO 
SEND IN THIRTY THOUSAND EXTRA TROOPS INTO 
SICHUAN PROVINCE CLEARLY THERE IS 
A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THE GROUND 
NOT JUST FOR THE SURVIVORS WHO HAVE 
BEEN WITHOUT HEAT HAVE BEEN 
WITHOUT SHELTER MANY OF THEM AND 
HAVE BEEN WITHOUT FOOD AND WATER 
BUT ALSO FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
TRAPPED IN THE RUBBLE AND THAT'S A 
HUGE NUMBER CHINA HAS ONLY FINALLY 
GOT INTO THE EPICENTRE OF THE 
EARTHQUAKE AND THERE THEY ARE 
FINDING ENTIRE VILLAGES ENTIRE 
TOWNS DEVASTATED EVERY BUILDING 
DESTROYED CRIES COMING FROM THE 
RUBBLE WITHOUT THE NECESSARY RESCUE 
TEAMS THERE TO HELP GET THE PEOPLE 
INTO SAFETY THAT'S WHY THEY ARE 
SENDING IN THE EXTRA TROOPS 
HOW MANY TOWNS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED 
BY THIS 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY A 
HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM EACH 
DIFFERENT AREA AND FROM EACH 
DIFFERENT TOWN IT ISN'T JUST A FEW 
HUNDRED PEOPLE BUT TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE MISSING 
CHINA HAS BEEN REVISING THE NUMBERS

THAT'S RUBBISH AND WE'LL TAKE THE 
KETTLE AND THE T. V. AND THE PRINT 
WAS WORTH HOW MUCH 
TENS OF 
THOUSANDS THOUSANDS WE ARE GETTING MORE INFORMATION 
ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE AREA 
NEAR THE EPICENTRE OF THE CHINESE 
EARTHQUAKE REPORTS OF TOWNS BEING 
RAISED TO THE GROUND 
WE CAN GET THE THE LATEST FROM THE 
B. B. C.'S CHINA EDITOR SHIRONG CHEN 
WHO KNOWS THE REGION VERY WELL 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US US HOW 
MANY RESCUE TEAMS ARE GETTING TO 
THE AREAS 
THE RESCUE TEAMS AND THE 
ARMED FORCES HAVE MANAGED TO GET TO 
THE EPICENTRE NOW IT IS A VERY 
DIFFICULT AREA TO GET TO ESPECIALLY 
WITH THE MOUNTAINS AND THE VALLEYS 
AND THE MANY OF THE ROADS ARE 
DESTROYED PEOPLE FIND IT VERY HARD 
EVEN TO USE HELICOPTERS BECAUSE OF 
THE MOUNTAINS AND THE VISIBILITY 
PROBLEM L. WAS THERE IN MARCH 
COVERING A DIFFERENT STORY AND AS 
WE DROVE PAST THE VALLEY AROUND 
THE BANKS OF BANKS YOU CAN SEE THE 
AREA THERE IS ONLY ONE MAJOR ROAD 
LEADING FROM THE CAPITAL CITY OF 
CHENGDU UP NORTH PASSING THE 
EPICENTRE WHEN YOU GET THERE YOU 
WILL SEE YOU ARE ENGULFED BY HIGH 
MOUNTAINS ON BOTH SIDES THERE IS 
ONLY ONE ROAD GETTING INTO THE 
COUNTY'S MAIN TOWN THERE 
ONCE THAT ROAD WAS CUT OFF THEN IT 
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET IN AND 
THERE ARE OF COURSE OTHER AREAS 
VERY CLOSE TO THE EPICENTRE THAT 
ARE VERY MUCH WORSE AFFECTED AS 
WELL FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED 
KILOMETRES AWAY TO THE NORTH EAST 
THE COUNTY OF BEICHUAN THAT'S WHERE 
WE FIRST HEARD THE HEAVY CASUALTY 
FIGURES FIGURES STILL A LOT OF AREAS TO GET TO 
THERE ARE STILL OTHER AREAS THAT 
ARE INACCESSIBLE THAT WILL TAKE 
LONG TIME THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES 
REACTED SWIFTLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN BURMA 
WHICH HAS BEEN RELUCTANT AFTER THE 
CYCLONE TO ACCEPT INTERNATIONAL AID 
AND TO MOUNT A HUGE RESCUE EFFORT 
THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES ACTED 
DIFFERENTLY 
YES MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENTLY COMPARED WITH HOW THE GOVERNMENT IS 
REACTING TO THIS CRISIS TO WHAT 
HAPPENED OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN THE 
WHOLE CITY TO THE NORTH EAST OF 
CHINA WAS PHYSICALLY WIPED OUT 
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT THIS TIME 
AROUND THEY HAVE REACTED VERY 
SWIFTLY THE CHINESE PREMIER WAS ON 
THE AEROPLANE TO THE DISASTER AREA 
WITHIN TWO HOURS OF THE EARTHQUAKE 
AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS NOW 
MOBILISED OF COURSE EVEN THOUGH 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET TO THE AREA 
BUT PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE ARE ARE 
CONTRIBUTE THEIR BIT IF TERMS OF 
RAISING FUNDS AND KEEPING MESSAGES 
GOING AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
HAS BEEN VERY OPEN ABOUT THE SCALE 
OF THE DISASTER AND THE CHINESE

THAT FIRST OF ALL IT IS QUITE GOOD 
FOR THE ECONOMIES OF SOUTH AFRICA 
AND SOUTH AMERICA TO SELL FLOWERS 
SECONDLY THEY PROVIDE FLOWERS YOU

ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS BEING 
ASKED BY NEW INQUIRY INTO THE 
DILEMMAS FACED BY CARERS AND 
DOCTORS DOCTORS WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT 
FIRST WE ARE GOING TO HEAR DENISE 
LINTERN'S EXPERIENCES OF CARING FOR 
HER HUSBAND AND STANLEY HAS AMOUNT 
ZIMMERS ZIMMERS ALZHEIMER'S 
WHEN HE STOPPED TALKING THAT WAS 
DRAMATIC BECAUSE IT ALMOST SEEMED 
AS THOUGH THAT WAS OVERNIGHT AND 
YOU KNEW THAT HE STILL KNEW WHAT 
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT HE JUST 
DIDN'T WANT TO SPEAK IF I I WAS 
TRYING TO RATIONALISE IT MYSELF HE 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRECISE SORT OF 
PERSON AND I THINK ONCE PEOPLE 
THOUGHT THAT HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND 
HIM AND HE WASN'T SAYING THE RIGHT 
WORDS HE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK AT 
ALL REALLY 
SOMETIMES HE DID HAVE THE URGE TO 
GO AND WANDER OFF AND THEN YES YOU 
ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF 
HE HAS GONE AND YOU DON'T KNOW 
ABOUT IT YOU KNOW WHERE DO YOU 
START LOOKING 
I WAS REALLY SCARED ONE TIME WHEN I 
WAS TRYING TO PAY BY CHEQUE AND HE 
WOULDN'T STAY WITH ME HE WAS 
GETTING CROSS BECAUSE I WAS HOLDING 
HIS HAN AND TRYING TO WRITE THE 
CHEQUE AND HE WALKED OUT OF THE 
SHOP AND IT WAS THE BUSY HIGH 
STREET AND I WAS PANIC STRICKEN 
PANIC STRICKEN 
THAT IS IS DENISE LINTERN 
HUGH WHITTALL IS FROM THE NUFFIELD 
COUNCIL ON BIOETHICS AND GILLIAN 
LASOCKI CARES FOR HER ELDERLY 
MOTHER MOTHER GILLIAN YOU FACED THIS ISSUE OF 
WHETHER TO TELL YOUR MOTHER THE 
TRUTH OR NOT ABOUT HER PARENTS 
BECAUSE SHE ASKS WHERE THEY ARE 
WHAT IS THE ISSUE THERE 
WE HAD AN 
ACCIDENT IN FACT THE FIRST WEEK 
THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS IN THE HOUSE 
WITH MY MOTHER SHE ACTUALLY TOLD 
HER THE TRUTH AND MY MOTHER WAS 
INCONSOLABLE FOR HOURS AND WORRIED 
THE REST OF THE DAY WHAT WAS SHE 
GOING TO DO IF HER ARE PARENTS 
WEREN'T AROUND ANYMORE TO LOOK 
AFTER HER IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO 
GET USED TO THE FACT LIVING WITH 
HER I CAN'T TELL HER THE TRUTH 
ANYMORE ANYMORE WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN SHE ASKS THAT 
QUESTION 
I SAY THEY HAVE GONE ON QUESTION HOLIDAY THEY WILL BE BACK LATER 
YOU WILL SEE THEM SOON AND SHE IS 
HAPPY ABOUT THAT 
IT PUTS GILLIAN IN DIFFICULT 
POSITION DOESN'T IT HUGH AND SO 
MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH THE 
SAME THING FEELING THEY ARE ALMOST 
FORCED TO LIE TO THE PEOPLE THEY 
CARE SO DESPERATE FOR IN ORDER TO 
KEEP THEM SAFE 
IT IS THE DILEMMA 
THAT MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE 
FACING EVERY DAY SOME OF THEM 
SEEMINGLY TRIPAL IF A PERSON HAD 
ALWAYS TAKEN PRIDE IN HER 
APPEARANCE BUT NOW ONLY WANTS TO 
GO OUT IN HER DRESSING GOWN HOW DO 
YOU TAKE ACCOUNT OF WHAT HER 
PREVIOUS WISHES WERE AS TO WHAT SHE 
SEEMS TO WISH NOW IT SEEMS TRIFAL 
BUT IT IS A MORE DIFFICULT POSITION 
OTHERS CAN BE MORE SERIOUS WHETHER 
TO ALLOW SOMEBODY TAKE PART IN A 
RESEARCH PROGRAMME 
OR WHETHER YOU DISGUISE MEDICATION 
IN THEIR FOOD 
WITHIN THE ONE HAND 
WE LIKE TO TELL THE TRUTH BUT AT 
THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO PROTECT 
THE PEOPLE WHO WE LOVE AND WE CARE 
FOR AND THESE THINGS ARE IN 
CONFLICT AND PEOPLE NEED HELP 
GETTING THROUGH THE QUESTIONS 
RESTRICTING MOVEMENT FOR INSTANCE 
YOU HAD PROBLEM WITH YOUR MOTHER 
TRYING TO GET OVER THE GARDEN 
FENCE 
RIDICULOUS 
THAT IT SEEMS FENCE THAT AN EIGHTY FIVE YEAR OLD WOULD WANT TO 
TRY AND DO THAT SHE IS STILL 
MOBILE PHYSICALLY MENLY SHE CAN'T 
UNDERSTAND THAT SHE SHOULDN'T BE 
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA YOU COULD 
ARGUE THEY HAVE SEIZED TO BE ADULTS 
AND BECOME DEPENDANTS AND CHILDREN 
IN A WAY 
TO SOME EXTENT BUT ONE 
IMPORTANT DIMENSION IS THE FACT 
THEY HAVE HAD ALL THEIR PREVIOUS 
LIVES VIEWS OPINIONS THOUGHTS 
WISHES THAT TO SOME EXTENT SHOULD 
BEAR UPON HOW WE TREAT THEM NOW 
HOW YOU ACCOUNT FOR THIS IN THESE 
NEW CIRCUMSTANCES CAN BE DIFFICULT 
AND WHILST YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE 
PEOPLE TO BE INDEPENDENT YOU 
NEVERTHELESS WANT TO PROTECT THEM 
FROM HARM SOMEBODY WHO LOVES 
COOKING BUT NOW IS NO LONGER SAFE 
WITH KNIVES DO YOU LET THEM NEAR 
THE KICH SNN OR KITCHEN OR MAYBE 
YOU COULD USE ELECTRONIC TAGS OR 
VIDEO SURVEILLANCE BUT THIS 
INVADES THEIR PRIVACY IT IS NOT 
QUITE LIKE LIKE TREATING THEM AS 
CHILDREN THEY HAVE THE WHOLE LIFE 
HISTORY THAT ARRIVES WITH THEM 
GILLIAN WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON YOU 
IN HAVING TO DEAL WITH YOUR MOTHER 
AND HAVING TO BECOME THE MOTHER OF 
SOMEBODY WHO HAS ESSENTIALLY 
REGRESSED 
IT IS BECOMING THE REGRESSED MOTHER OF A PERSON AGAIN BUT SHE 
HAS TO BE WATCHED MOST OF THE TIME 
FOR SHE WANTS TO GO INTO THE 
KITCHEN AND TOUCH KNIVES DO THINGS 
AND SHE IS NOT CAPABLE OF BEING 
INDEPENDENT ANYMORE 
I THINK THE IMPACT MEANS THAT I 
HAVE HAD TO CHANGE MY ROLE AND MY 
ATTITUDE TOWARDS HER HER BUT I TRY 
TO REMEMBER THE PERSONALITY SHE HAD 
BEFORE BEFORE YOU ARE STARTING THIS CONSULTATION 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE 
RESULTS 
WELL WE WANT TO FIRST RESULTS OPEN UP THE QUESTIONS OPEN UP THE 
ISSUES AND UNDERSTAND THE 
EXPERIENCES THAT PEOPLE HAVE AND 
GET THEIR OPINIONS OF HOW THEY TRY 
TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS AND THEN 
IF WE CAN HELP SUPPORT 
PROFESSIONALS CARER SUPPORT 
ORGANISATIONS TO PROVIDE MORE 
CONFIDENCE TO PEOPLE IN BEING ABLE 
TO TACKLE THESE PROBLEMS WITHOUT 
PEOPLE THINKING THEY ARE ALWAYS 
DOING SOMETHING WRONG 
ANYBODY CAN FEED INTO THE PROCESS 
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
GOT SOMETHING TO SAY 
IT HELPS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SIMILAR 
PROBLEMS TO YOUR OWN 
EXACTLY EXACTLY CONTACT THE NUFFIELD COUNCIL IF YOU 
WANT TO GET INVOLVED 
RESCUE WORKERS ARE STILL STRUGGLING 
TO REACH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
TRAPPED FOLLOWING THE CHINESE 
EARTHQUAKE EARTHQUAKE GORDON BROWN WILL TODAY ANNOUNCE 
PLANS FOR THE NEXT PARLIAMENTARY 
SESSION INCLUDING GIVEN GIVING 
LOCAL COMMUNITIES MORE SAY IN HOW 
THEY ARE POLICED 
THERE WERE A MAN IN BLACK WHETHER 
IT WAS THE MEN IN BLACK I WILL 
NEVER KNOW 
THEY CAME TO SEE HER WHEN SHE WAS 
OUT FLYING SAUCERS A SPLASH 
FLASHING LIGHTS AND THE SKY WE 
TAKE LOOK AT THE REAL LIFE X. FILES FROM THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 
CARROLL SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THAT SORT 
OF THING SHE IS ALWAYS LOOKING UP 
AT THE SKY CARROLL 
THERE IS RAIN ON THE RISE IN TODAY 
THERE IS FAIR BIT OF CLOUD AROUND 
THIS MORNING WE HAVE A CHANGE HOW 
WAY TODAY THEY WILL BE SOME 
SUNSHINE THERE IT IS ALSO QUITE 
BREEZY THE BREEZE WOULD TAKE THE 
EDGE OF THE TEMPERATURE IT WILL DO 
SO FOR THE REST OF THE DAY THE 
BEST OF THE SUNSHINE IN WESTERN 
SCOTLAND CENTRAL AND EASTERN 
SCOTLAND SEEN MORE CLOUD CENTRAL 
AND EASTERN ENGLAND ALSO SEEN MORE 
CLOUD SCENE CLOUD IN EAST 
ANGLIA THE SOUTH WEST SEEING SOME 
CLOUD MIX AND SINCE THEN 
THICKER CLOUD TOWARDS THE EAST OF 
WALES BUT FOR THE WEST WE'RE BACK 
IN THE SUN NOT A BAD START TO THE 
DAY ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
THROUGH THE COURSE OF THIS MORNING 
THE CLOUD WILL BREAK FAIRLY READILY 
ACROSS EAST ANGLIA AND THE MIDLANDS 
FOR THE REST OF US UNDER THE CLOUD 
IT WILL PUSH BACK TOWARDS THE COAST 
SLOWLY SOME OF IT WILL STICK 
LATER ON IN THE DAY WILL SEE SOME 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING ANYWHERE FROM 
HAMPSHIRE WEST WE HAVE GOT THE 
RAIN COMING IN PUSHING UP ACROSS 
THE CHANNEL ISLANDS INTO SOUTHERN 
PARTS OF ENGLAND AND EVENTUALLY 
INTO WALES A LOT OF CLOUD AROUND 
TONIGHT THE DAY WILL START CLOUDY 
FOR MONEY THE WEST SEEING THE BEST 
OF THE SUNSHINE RAIN PUSHING 
STEADILY NORTH INTO MUCH OF WALES 
AND EAST ANGLIA BEHIND IT SHOWERS 
SOMETHING WE ARE KEEPING AN LAND 
IS THE RISK OF SOME HEAVY RAIN 
THROUGH TONIGHT AND TOMORROW 
GENERALLY SPEAKING WE'RE LOOKING AT 
ABOUT AN INCH IN SOME PLACES BUT 
LOCALLY WE COULD SEE MORE 
A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO WE WERE 
ASKING FOR QUESTIONS FOR THE BOSS 
OF SAINSBURY'S LOTS ABU HASSAN THE 
MEN LOT OF YOU HAVE SENT THE MEN 
ONE THING I KNEW MINDS IS HOW MUCH 
WE'RE PAYING FOR FOOD ONE THING 
ON THE YOUR MINDS 
NEW FIGURES SHOW FOOD PRICES RISING 
BY SEVENTY TWO PER CENT ENERGY UP BY OVER EIGHT PER CENT AND 
FUEL FOR TRANSPORT UP BY NEARLY NINETY 
PER CENT THE ESSENTIALS OF EVERYDAY LIFE 
RISING SHARPLY IN PRICE MANY OF 
THOSE THINGS OR SOLD BY SAINSBURY'S 
ITS SALES ARE UP FOUR PER CENT IT MADE A 
PROFIT OF JUST SHY OF FIVE BILLION 
LAST YEAR MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR 
THIS MAN JUST THINKING THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE IS TURNAROUND PLAN HAS 
BOOSTED SALES THAT IS MORE THAN HE 
HAD FORECAST YOUR ORIGINAL 
PROJECTION WAS THAT YOU WOULD 
BOOSTER SALES BY TWENTY FIVE BILLION IT IS 
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED 
IT IS WE HAVE CREATED TURNAROUND 
WE'RE CHECKING IN TODAY ON LAST 
YEAR'S PERFORMANCE ALL THE THREE 
YEARS WE HAVE GROWN OURSELVES TO 
ZERO POINT SEVEN MILLION 
HE MUST BE FEELING PRETTY SMUG 
ABOUT THAT 
I AM PLEASED NOT PERSONALLY BUT 
ALSO ON BEHALF OR ALL OF MY 
COLLEAGUES ON US AT SAINSBURY'S 
THERE IS BONUS POOL OF FORTY SEVEN MILLION 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT A BUSINESS 
LIKE SAINSBURY'S IS THAT EVERYONE 
CAN SHARE IN THE SUCCESS 
THESE ARE OFFICIAL FIGURES SHOW 
FOOD PRICES UP BY SEVENTY TWO PER CENT WE FORGET 
THAT OVER MANY YEARS YOU AND THE 
REST OF THE SUPERMARKETS HAVE MADE 
FOOD CHEAPER THOSE DAYS ARE GONE 
DEFINITELY WE HAVE SEEN FOOD AND 
DOWN IN PRICE FOR THE LAST SIX TO 
EIGHT YEARS FOLLOW LAST YEAR WE 
HAVE REPORTED OUR INFLATION AT 
ABOUT TWO PER CENT WE THINK SOME OTHER 
HEADLINE LEVELS OF INFLATION TO 
POWER OVER READING OF REALITY 
OUR YOU'RE PRICE RISES LOWER THAN 
THE OTHERS BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING 
THE PAIN IN THE POCKET OR BECAUSE 
YOU'RE SQUEEZING THEIR SUPPLIERS 
IT IS PARTLY PARK EVER TURNAROUND 
PLAN WE HAVE SPENT FOUR AND AND FIFTY 
MILLION DOING THAT YES IT IS 
PARTLY A SAINSBURY'S THING BUT YOU 
SEE MORE PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY MORE 
PRICE CUTS THAT IS REDUCING THE 
REALITY OF WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE 
EXPERIENCING IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT 
FOR THE HEADLINE MEASURES OF 
INFLATION TO PICK THAT UP 
AT A TIME WHEN CONSUMERS ARE 
WORRIED IT MEANS IN THE 
BATTLEGROUND BETWEEN YOU AND THE 
OTHER SUPERMARKETS PRICE IS NOW 
MOST IMPORTANT 
THINK PRICE IS MORE IMPORTANT BUT I 
WOULD NOT SAY IT IS THE KEY THING 
THE CUSTOMERS SAY FOOD QUALITY IS 
JUST AS IMPORTANT THEY WANT HIGH 
QUALITY AND LOW PRICES YOU CAN DO 
THAT 
MORE AFTER A TEMP EIGHT AM THAT FLASHING COLOURED LIGHTS AND THE 
NIGHT SKY FLYING DISCS AND 
LITTLE ALIEN IN GREEN OVERALLS 
CALLED ELGAR THESE ARE SOME OF THE 
REPORTED U. F. O. SIGHTINGS CONTAINED IN 
MINISTRY OF DEFENCE FILES THAT HAVE 
UNTIL NOW BEEN TOP SECRET THEY 
HAVE THE RELEASED TO THE NATIONAL 
ARCHIVES THE FILES SHOW THE 
GOVERNMENT DID LITTLE TO 
INVESTIGATE INVESTIGATE THIS IS THE FANTASY COURTESY OF 
CHILDREN'S NEWSREEL IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE NOW 
THAT MORE FILES HAVE BEEN RELEASED 
WHAT ARE THE FACTS ABOUT U. K.'S 
ABOUT U. F. O. SIGHTINGS IN THE U. K. RUTH 
SAW SOMETHING IN THE SKY FROM 
GARDEN IN NORTH LONDON IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR 
THE MORE I STARED AT IT THE MORE I 
SAW AT 
CHANGING OF COLLAR CHANGING OF COLOUR 
POLICE WERE 
CALLED AND CONFIRMED EUROPHILE 
SIGHTING NOW THERE ARE REPORTS 
THAT THE EAST THE U. F. O. SIGHTING 
THERE WAS NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION 
THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO SAY THAT 
WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME ARE YOU 
DISAPPOINTED DISAPPOINTED I AM YES L. WOULD HAVE LIKED 
SOMEONE TO CLARIFY THE SITUATION 
SOME U. F. O. FILES HAVE BEEN MADE 
PUBLIC BEFORE BUT NOW THE MOD IS 
OPENING UP ALL ITS U. F. O. FILES GOING 
BACK THIRTY YEARS THIS IS THE FIRST 
BATCH THEY HAVE BEEN COPIED ONTO 
THE INTERNET 
THE OUTSTANDING THING FROM LOOKING 
AT THESE PAPERS IS IT BECOMES QUITE 
OBVIOUS THAT IT LACKS A MISTAKE AND 
IF ANYTHING ON THESE REPORTS 
THAT LITTLE ACTION THE MINISTRY OF 
DEFENCE MUST HAVE RECEIVED SCORES 
OF THESE REPORTS ON AVERAGE TWO HUNDRED 
TO THREE HUNDRED PER YEAR IT IS CLEAR THEY 
DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO 
FOLLOW THEM UP 
THEIR O. TWO REPORTS OF ENCOUNTERS WITH 
ALIENS THEIR ARE ONE OF THEM 
CAME FROM AN ELDERLY MAN IN 
ALDERSHOT WHO SAID AT CRAFT LANDED 
BESIDE HIM AND SOME LITTLE MEN IN 
GREEN OVERALLS INVITED HIM ON BOARD 
NEITHER THIS ACCOUNT HOLDERS FROM 
MORE CREDIBLE WITNESSES FROM 
AIRLINE PILOTS APPEARED TO HAVE 
BEEN INVESTIGATED THESE FILES ARE 
BOUND TO BE A DISAPPOINTMENT TO 
MANY WHEN YOU HAVE FOUR RESEARCHER 
TOLD RUTH AFTER THE SIGHTING SHE 
MIGHT BE VISITED BY STRANGE MEN 
WEARING BLACK SUITS HER NEIGHBOUR 
GAVE HER A MESSAGE 
THERE WERE THREE GENTLEMEN DRESSED 
IN BLACK SUITS DRIVING BEAUTIFUL 
SHINY BLACK CAR KNOCKING ON THE 
DOOR FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WITH 
THEIR WORK I HAVE NO IDEA 
HE THEY WERE MEN IN BLACK 
THEY WERE MEN AND BLACK WHETHER IT 
WAS THE MAN IN BAK MEN IN BLACK 
I WILL NEVER KNOW

IN THE FILES 
WE HAVE A U. F. O. EXPERT NONE LATER

THINGS INCLUDING A U. F. O. ON MY LONG

SCHOOLGIRL IS BROUGHT OUT FROM THE 
RUBBLE SHE'S LUCKY TO HAVE 
SURVIVED THIS IS WHAT'S LEFT OF 
HER PRIMARY SCHOOL MANY OF HER

PARENTS WAIT DESPERATE FOR NEWS AT 
THIS SCHOOL TWELVE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN 
PULLED OUT ALIVE THIS RESCUE 
WORKER EXPLAINED THAT SHE COULD 
HEAR THE VOICES OF CHILDREN THEY 
HAD BEEN TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE 
BUILDING WHEN IT COLLAPSED UP 
UNTIL NOW RESCUE TEAMS HAVE BEEN 
WORKING UNDER APPALLING CONDITIONS 
TORRENTIAL RAIN HAS BEEN HAMPERING 
THEIR EFFORTS MANY ROADS ARE STILL 
DIFFICULT TO PASS BUT IT IS HOPED 
THE BETTER WEATHER WILL MAKE IT 
EASIER TO GET AID TO THOSE WHO 
DESPERATELY NEED IT THE SURVIVORS 
FACE A GRIM REALITY HOMELESS IN 
THE COLD AND WORRIED ABOUT 
AFTERSHOCKS THOUSANDS OF EXTRA

LET'S TALK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT 
DAN GRIFFITHS DAN JOINS US FROM 
DUJIANGYAN HELLO DAN WHAT IS 
HAPPENING THERE NOW 
THAT'S RIGHT 
A MASSIVE RESCUE OPERATION IS UNDER 
WAY HERE THE SCHOOL IS DIRECTLY 
BEHIND ME IT IS A PILE OF RUBBLE 
AND TWISTED METAL AT THE MOMENT 
THERE ARE LARGE CRANES HANGING OVER 
IT AND A HUGE NUMBER OF RESCUE 
WORKERS TRYING TO CLEAR THE DEBRIS 
TO GET TO WHAT IS THOUGHT TO BE 
MORE THAN A THOUSAND SCHOOL PUPILS 
TRAPPED BENEATH THAT WRECKAGE OF 
COURSE THERE ARE MANY MANY 
ANXIOUS PARENTS HERE MANY OF THEM 
COMPLETELY DISTRAUGHT AND IN TEARS 
THE RESCUE WORK IS MOVING RATHER 
SLOWLY AT THE MOMENT L. THINK THAT 
IS ADDING TO THEIR ANXIETY AT THE 
MOMENT AS WELL ALSO DON'T FORGET 
THAT OF COURSE FOR MOST OF THE 
PEOPLE HERE CHINA'S ONE CHILD 
POLICY MEANS THEIR ONLY OFFSPRING 
LIE BENEATH THOSE RUINS SO WE MAY 
BE FACING A WHOLE GENERATION LOST 
UNDERNEATH THOSE RUINS OF THIS 
SCHOOL 
IT DOES SOUND INCREDIBLE TO SCHOOL THINK THERE ARE A THOUSAND CHILDREN 
UNDERNEATH THAT RUBBLE IS THERE 
ANY GOOD NEWS DAN HAS ANYBODY 
BEEN PULLED OUT ALIVE 
AS FAR AS WE 
UNDERSTAND THERE IS VERY LITTLE 
GOOD NEWS AT THE MOMENT IT IS ALL 
EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON TRYING TO 
CLEAR THE DEBRIS YESTERDAY PEOPLE 
WERE TALKING ABOUT HEARING THE 
CRIES OF SOME OF THE CHILDREN 
TRAPPED UNDER THERE TODAY THEY 
HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT IN 
ONE CORNER OF THE PLAYGROUND A 
SMALL TEMPORARY MORTUARY HAS BEEN 
SET UP WHERE THE BODIES OF THOSE 
CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND IN 
THE RUINS SO FAR HAVE BEEN PLACED 
SO I THINK MOST PEOPLE HERE ARE 
EXPECTING THE SITUATION REALLY TO 
HAVE A VERY VERY BLEAK OUTCOME 
INDEED THAT VERY FEW OF THE 
CHILDREN THAT ARE NOW TRAPPED WILL 
MAKE IT OUT ALIVE 
THANK YOU DAN 
ONE THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE 
BEEN BURIED UNDERNEATH A SCHOOL

A LIFE SIZED PAINTING BY LUCIAN 
FREUD OF A NAKED WOMAN HAS SET A 
NEW WORLD RECORD PRICE FOR WORK BY 
A LIVING ARTIST THE PAINTING IS OF 
JOBCENTRE SUPERVISOR SUE TILLEY 
SOMEBODY SPENT SEVENTEEN MILLION ON IT 
WHY SHOULDN'T THEY DO YOU NOT LIKE 
IT IT IT'S A REMARKABLE SUM OF MONEY 
IT IS IT IS A LOVELY PAINTING 
THOUGH THOSE ARE THE TOP STORIES 
COMING UP WE ASK IF ALL CRIMES ARE 
ALWAYS UNACCEPTABLE THAT MEANS 
TAKING A FEW ENVELOPES FROM THE 
STATIONERY CUPBOARD FORTY PER CENT OF US 
ADMIT BREAKING THE LAW IN THE PAST 
FIVE YEARS 
WE HAVE A REMARKABLE STORY FOR YOU 
A STORY OF TIM COULSON HE WAS A 
TUBE PASSENGER CAUGHT UP IN THE 
LONDON BOMBINGS ON THE TUBE OF SEVENTH 
JULY TWO THOUSAND FIVE INSTEAD OF RUNNING FOR 
SAFETY TIM ALONG WITH ANOTHER 
PASSENGER SMASHED OPEN THE WINDOW 
OF THEIR CARRIAGE AND GAVE FIRST 
AID TO THE INJURED AND DYING TODAY 
HE'S BEING REWARDED FOR HIS BRAVERY 
BY THE ROYAL HUMANE SOCIETY AND HE 
IS WITH US NOW GOOD MORNING TO 
TAKE YOU BACK TO IT YOU WERE ON 
THE UNDERGROUND THAT WAS BLOWN UP 
YOU COULD HAVE MADE YOUR WAY TO 
SAFETY AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT YOU DECIDED TO 
STAY DOWN THERE WHY 
I DON'T KNOW 
THAT I COULD HAVE DONE L. THINK WE 
ALL HAVE A PERSONALITY MAKE UP THAT 
COMES TO THE FORE THERE WAS A 
PURPOSE FOR ME THAT DAY L. DIDN'T 
KNOW WHAT IT WAS UNTIL THAT 
OCCASION WHEN THE BOMB EXPLODED 
THAT WAS TO RELIEVE HUMAN SUFFERING 
BECAUSE ONCE YOU HAVE HEARD THE 
CRIES OF PEOPLE IN SUCH AGONY YOU 
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WERE WERE YOU A TRAINED FIRST AIDER 
ONLY IN 
AS MUCH AS MOST TEACHERS TAKE 
FIRST AID IN A WORKPLACE AND IF WE 
REMEMBER EVERY THREE YEARS WE 
UPDATE IT 
WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST 
REACTION CAN YOU REMEMBER 
I DO 
REMEMBER THOSE MEMORIES ARE QUITE 
VIVID STILL L. HAVE LEARNT TO COPE 
WITH THEM THROUGH VARIOUS HELP AND 
SUPPORT FROM FAMILY YOU INITIALLY 
MOVE TOWARDS THINKING I'M STILL 
ALIVE THEREFORE I CAN DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT THIS SO FOR ME IT WAS AN 
INSTANT RESPONSE ALMOST RUNNING ON 
ADRENALINE 
LIKE A GUT INSTINCT ADRENALINE YES 
UNIMAGINABLE SCENES IT IS NOT YES SOMETHING YOU WOULD EVER PREPARE 
FOR IT MUST HAVE TAKEN A LITTLE 
WHILE FOR IT TO KICK IN AS TO 
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
I ALSO THINK 
THEY ARE SCENES THAT NOBODY ELSE 
SHOULD SEE EVER ONE OF THE 
BENEFITS OF BEING IN TOTAL DARKNESS 
IS THAT YOU USE YOUR HANDS TO FIND 
YOUR WAY SO TO SOME EXTENT THE 
INITIAL SHOCK OF WHAT I WAS DEALING 
WITH WAS HIDDEN FROM VIEW 
IT WAS 
COMPLETELY DARK 
IT WAS YES THE 
TUNNEL LIGHTS CAME ON A SHORT WHILE 
LATER AGAIN THEY ARE VERY DIM 
BULBS 
HOW DID YOU KNOW WHO TO BULBS TREAT AND HOW TO TREAT THEM IF IT 
WAS IN THE DARK 
AGAIN IT WAS ON A 
VERY BASIC LEVEL IF SOMEBODY MADE 
A NOISE THEY WERE ALYE THEREFORE 
YOU WORK WITH THEM TO FIND OUT 
WHETHER THEY HAD THEY WERE ALIVE 
THEREFORE YOU WORK WITH THEM TO 
FIND OUT WHETHER THEY HAD LIMBS 
MISSING YOU USE WHAT CLOTHING YOU 
HAVE AND WHAT CLOTHING THE 
PASSENGERS WERE WEARING 
DID YOU 
TAKE SOME OF THEM AWAY FROM THE 
SCENE 
NOT AT THAT POINT YOU SCENE YOU TREATED THEM WHERE THEY WERE YES YES HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU HELP ONE 
MAN DIED IN YOUR ARMS 
THAT IS A 
GENTLEMAN CALLED STAN HE WAS THE 
THIRD PERSON THAT I WORKED WITH 
AGAIN PART OF MY OWN DISCOMFORT 
FOR A LONG TIME OVER A YEAR WAS 
THAT I COULD HAVE DONE MORE FOR HIM 
AND I SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE WHAT WHAT MORE COULD YOU HAVE DONE 
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THE MEDICAL 
PROFESSION HAVE SAID BECAUSE HE WAS 
SEVERED THERE WAS NO EVEN IF WE 
HAD ALL THE TOOLS AND SKILLS 
NOBODY COULD HAVE SAVED HIM L. DID 
WANT TO ASSURE HIM AND HIS FAMILY 
WHICH I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT HE 
DIDN'T DIE ALONE BECAUSE I 
POSITIVELY BELIEVE THAT IS SO 
IMPORTANT 
YOU DID MORE THAN MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE MORE THAN MANY PEOPLE YOU 
SHOULD HEAR WHAT ALISON SAID ABOUT 
YOU IT'S HARD TO PUT INTO WORDS 
THE GRATITUDE I FEEL TOWARDS TIM 
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO VENTURE INTO OUR 
TUBE HE DIDN'T HAVE TO CONTINUE TO 
HELP AFTER SEEING THE SCENE IN OUR 
CARRIAGE AND AFTER TRYING TO HELP 
ANOTHER PERSON WHO DIED IN HIS ARMS 
TIM IS INDEED THE BRAVEST PERSON I 
HAVE EVER KNOWN 
MARVELLOUS YES 
YOU ARE QUITE EMOTIONAL HEARING 
THAT 
I AM YES L. THINK IT'S TO THAT HEAR THAT ABOUT YOURSELF IS 
WONDERFUL BUT IT TAKES SOME TIME 
TO INGEST IT REALLY 
WELL YOU ARE 
GOING TO BE RECOGNISED TODAY BY THE 
ROYAL HUMANE SOCIETY FOR YOUR 
BRAVERY 
YES I'M VERY EXCITED BRAVERY ABOUT THAT L. THINK IT GIVES TWO 
MESSAGES ONE IS THAT I'M 
PERSONALLY SOMEBODY IS SAYING 
THANK YOU AND YOU DON'T DO IT FOR 
THANKS BUT ALSO IT DOES GO A LONG 
WAY I HOPE TO THE CORE OF THAT 
SOCIETY IS ABOUT HELPING OTHER 
PEOPLE AND TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO DO IT 
ONE OTHER THING GOD 
FORBID IT SHOULD EVER HAPPEN AGAIN 
IF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WAS TO ARISE 
WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO 
ANYBODY ELSE WHO FOUND THEMSELVES 
IN THE SITUATION THAT YOU WERE IN 
I WOULDN'T WANT TO PRESCRIBE WHAT 
PEOPLE SHOULD DO IF YOU CAN FEEL 
IT WITHIN YOURSELF TO HELP THEN 
PLEASE GIVE IT TRY BECAUSE YOU 
CAN MAKE THAT DIFFERENCE YOU CAN 
SAVE A LIFE 
I AM REALLY PLEASED 
YOU HAVE FOUND TIME TO JOIN US 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS ON 
BEHALF OF ALL THE FAMILIES WHOSE 
LIVES YOU SAVED 
NOW THE WEATHER THERE WILL BE 
SUNSHINE AROUND EVEN IF IT IS NOT 
WITH YOU YET YOU SHOULD SEE IT BY 
THE END OF THAT DATE 
THERE IS STILL ON NORTH EASTERLY 
BREEZE ACROSS MUCH OF ENGLAND 
TAKING THE EDGE OF THE TEMPERATURES 
ACROSS SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND 
AND THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
SUNSHINE FIRST THING BUT ON 
CENTRAL ENGLAND EASTWOOD THERE IS 
MORE CLOUD BUT THERE ARE HOLES IN 
THE CLOUD SO YOU WILL SEE SUNSHINE 
ACROSS PARTS OF YORKSHIRE EAST 
ANGLIA AND DOWN INTO THE SOUTH WE 
ARE BACK INTO THE SUNSHINE 
REMEMBER EVERYTHING IS TEMPERED BY 
THE NORTH EASTERLY BREEZE THE 
CLOUD WILL MELT ACROSS THE MIDLANDS 
AND EAST ANGLIA BUT THE CLOUD FOR 
THE REST OF US PUSHING SLOWLY BACK 
TO THE COAST AND FOR SOME OF US IT 
WILL LINGER FOR MUCH OF THE DAY 
WHERE IT DOES IT WILL HOLD BACK 
THE TEMPERATURES BUT IF YOU ARE 
OUT OF THE WIND AND THE BREEZE AND 
IN THE SUNSHINE TWENTY TWO IS THE TOP 
TEMPERATURE CHANGE IS AFOOT 
WE ARE ALREADY GETTING MESSAGES 
ABOUT THAT INTERVIEW GOOD ON YOU 
TIM COULSON

LIKE WITH FOOD YOU HAVE TO THINK 
ABOUT WHERE YOUR FLOWERS ARE COMING 
FROM MOST PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT 
IT SO THEY MIGHT BE SOURCING THEIR 
FOOD AND THINKING ABOUT WHETHER IT 
HAS BEEN FLOWN FROM THE OTHER SIDE 
OF THE WORLD BUT WITH FLOWERS IT 
DOES NOT ENTER THEIR HEADS L. WENT 
TO AN ORGANIC FOOD DINNER 
SPECTACULAR GREAT THING AND THEY 
WERE EATING SEASONAL FOOD AND IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE WAS CHERRY 
BLOSSOM MIXED WITH SWEET PEAS 
CRAZY 
WHY DOES IT MATTER WHY CRAZY CAN'T WE HAVE THE FLOWERS WE WANT 
AND SUPPORT ECONOMY IS FROM AFRICA 
AND SOUTH AMERICA AND THE REST WE WE HAVE TO SUPPORT A BRITISH GROWERS 
WHO ARE FINDING IT DIFFICULT WE 
ARE AS A NATION FANTASTIC 
GARDENERS AND GROWERS AND THAT IS 
GOING IT WILL BE GONE SO WE'LL 
HAVE TO WAKE UP TO IT NOW WE HAVE 
TO THINK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND 
AIR MILES WE CAN GROW IT SO WELL 
SO WHY BOTHER TO BRING IT FROM THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD WE HAVE 
THE BEST FLOWERS IN THE WORLD WE 
DON'T NEED EXOTICS WE HAVE 
WONDERFUL SWEET PEAS WONDERFUL 
ROSES WE HAVE THE BEST FLOWERS 
WHY IS IT THE MORE GLAMOUR STILL 
HAVE SOMETHING COMING FROM KENYA OR 
SOUTH AMERICA IT IS CRAZY FOR ME 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MOST 
WILDLY SOLD U. K. FLOUR 
CARNATION CARNATION DAFFODILS DAFFODILS WE ACTUALLY EXPORT THEM 
YOU REMEMBER THE FLOWER OF THE OUR 
CLUB BECAUSE YOU HAD A PINK FLOWER 
ON EARLIER 
THIS IS AN ORCHID FROM CORNWALL 
CANNOT PRONOUNCE IT 
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC WITH IT 
A DIFFERENT ONE EVERY TIME WE SEE 
HIM HIM WE SHOULD DO THAT A DIFFERENT 
FLOWER AN HOUR 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER 
BREAKING THE LAW IS EVER MORALLY 
ACCEPTABLE ACCEPTABLE ACCORDING TO A SURVEY FOR THE 
SECURITY FIRM G. FOUR S. SECURITY 
SERVICES SAY WE SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO 
GUILTY FOR TAKING STATIONERY FARE 
DODGING OR JUMPING DEFENCE AND NOT 
PAY TO GET IN CONCERT WE TOOK TO 
THE STREETS TO SEE WHAT DO YOU 
THINK THINK YOU DO NEED TO PAY EVEN TAKING A 
GRAPE FROM THE BAG IN THE BASKET 
THEY NEED TO PAY FOR IT 
WHEN YOU 
HAVE A LITTLE BABY PUSHING THEM IN 
THE TROLLEY MAYBE IT IS ALL RIGHT 
TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING AND THEN PAY 
FOR IT AT THE END 
IT IS 
SHOPLIFTING AND THEY MUST KNOW IT 
THEY PRETEND THEY DON'T BUT THEY 
DO 
YES OF COURSE I HAVE YES 
IT IS 
STILL STEALING AT THE END OF THE 
DAY YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT YOU YOU SHOULD ALWAYS PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET 
BECAUSE NOTHING IS LIFE IS FREE 
SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY FOR IT YOU 
HAVE TO PAY FOR WHAT EVER YOU HAVE 
IT IS ONLY FAIR 
SOMEBODY ALWAYS 
PAYS FOR IT IN THE END BUT OUR 
MORAL STANDARDS SLIPPING LINDA 
PAPADOPOULOS AND AGONY AND ANNA 
RAEBURN ARE JOINING US YOU ARE 
HAVING AN INTENSE CONVERSATION 
EARLIER HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN AND ON 
THE LOAD FROM THE OFFICE FOR A 
BREAK FROM A SUPERMARKET THE THE OFFICE THE IDEA FOR PERSONAL 
STATIONERY IF THERE WAS A STATION 
RECOVERED AND I NEEDED AN UMBRELLA 
YES MY DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS AT 
NURSERY SCHOOL CAME IN WITH A BAG 
AND ON THE BACK WAS WAS A LOGO OF 
AN INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION IS IS THE COMPANY GOING TO THE DOGS SHE SHE GETS A NICE QUESTION AND BECAUSE I 
AM THE OLD BAT I GET THIS 
WE HAD 
JUST ASKED HER IF SHE IS A 
CRIMINAL 
EVERYBODY HAS DONE IT OR CRIMINAL MOST PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT IN SOME 
MINOR WAY BECAUSE THE DEFINITION 
OF MORALITY IS THE CODES BY WHICH 
WE LIVE L. LOOKED IT UP IN THE 
DICTIONARY BEFORE I CAME THOSE 
CODES ARE DENTED BY THE BREAKDOWN 
OF COMMUNITY ANY KIND OF COMMUNITY 
NOW IT IS DIFFICULT TO BE 
RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS MADE 
AVAILABLE TO YOU AND YOU HAVE A 
PRESS MACHINE WHICH CONSTANTLY 
TELLS YOU THE PEOPLE YOU USED TO 
RESPECT WHO YOU LOOK TO FOR 
LEADERSHIP HAVE DONE IT ALSO THAT 
ENDORSE AS IT THE PAPERS ARE FULL 
OF DOCTORS WHO HAVE GIVEN THE WRONG 
DRUGS KILLING THEIR PATIENCE 
PATIENT POLITICIANS TO HAVE LIED 
TO US SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY 
CYNICALLY WHAT DO IT EXPECT OF A 
POLITICIAN BUT THERE IS NOBODY OUT 
THERE OFFERING A COUNTERBALANCE FOR 
THE SO MUCH YOU BELONG TO A FAITH 
COMMUNITY WILL YOU COME FROM A 
BACKGROUND LIKE THOSE PEOPLE WHO 
SAID NO YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT 
OTHERWISE IT GETS PAID FOR DOWN THE 
LINE 
PEOPLE IN SUPERMARKETS SAID LINE THEY EXPECT GRAZING THEY EARN HUGE 
PROFITS THAT IS WHY SOME PEOPLE 
SAY WHY CANNOT WE TAKE A FEW THINGS 
ABOUT PAYING FOR THEM 
WOULD YOU 
STEAL SOMEONE ELSE'S GRAPES HE 
WOULDN'T BUT THIS TESCO 
SAINSBURY'S THERE IS THE SENSE OF 
ENTITLEMENT BECAUSE WE FEEL THEY 
ARE MAKING THESE BIG PROFITS SO 
THEREFORE WE CAN GET IT FROM THEM 
IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE THE 
RELATIONSHIP FROM WHOM YOU ARE 
TAKING 
STEVE WHO WORKS IN A TAKING SUPERMARKET SAYS IT DOES CAUSE A 
PROBLEM PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR HALF 
EATEN ITEMS AND EMPTY WRAPPERS IN 
STRANGE PLACES TO HIDE THE 
DISHONESTY WE HAVE TO CHECK 
SHELVES BEHIND THE CEREALS 
IF ONE IN FOUR OF WAS A SAYING IT 
IS O. K. TO TAKE STUFF IT DOES NOT 
MATTER THREE IN FOUR OF US THAT DO 
NOT BELIEVE THAT SO MOST PEOPLE 
ARE VERY MORAL 
THAT IS ABOUT RIGHT IT HAS ALWAYS 
BEEN THIS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE 
WERE A GROUP OF PEOPLE EITHER 
BECAUSE OF THEIR UPBRINGING FAMILY 
PERSONALITY THEIR RELIGIOUS 
BELIEFS SOCIAL BELIEFS HAVE SAID 
NO I WON'T TAKE THINGS THEN YOU 
GET THE OTHER WAY AROUND WHICH IS 
IT IS GOING TO BE MORE TROUBLE FOR 
YOU TO PAY FOR IT WENT TO THE 
OFFICE MANAGER IN THE LAST PLACE I 
WORKED WHEN I WAS LEAVING AND HE 
SAID I HAVE TWO FILES DO YOU WANT 
ME TO PAY FOR THEM HE SAID YOU ARE 
THE ONLY ONE WHO AS AS FOR THOSE 
FILES IN TWENTY YEARS PLEASE TAKE IT 
ANOTHER LADY HAS SAID THAT SHE WAS 
UNDER CHARGE BY EIGHT AND SHE WENT 
BACK TO TELL THEM AND THE CHEMIST 
ALSO IMPRESSED THEY TOLD HER TO 
KEEP THE ITEM FOR FREE 
BECAUSE THAT WAS A SMALL BUSINESS 
THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT YOU'RE YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO THINK THIS TIME I 
SHOULDN'T DO IT OR IT DOES NOT 
MATTER YOU'LL MAKE A PERSONAL 
DECISION 
I WORRY IT WILL BE TAKEN DECISION OUT OF SOMEBODY'S WAGES THAT IS 
WHAT WOULD MAKE ME PANIC IF I TOOK 
SOMETHING FROM A SHOP 
I WON'T 
TOUCH PRIMARK I BELIEVE EVERY 
GARMENT SMELLS OF THE SWEAT AND 
BLOOD WHERE THEY ARE MADE 
IT IS 
THIS CONSUMERIST CULTURE WE LIVE IN 
AND WE ARE BOMBARDED ALL THE TIME 
WITH PEOPLE SAYING LIFE WOULD BE 
BETTER IF YOU HAVE STUFF THEN IF 
YOU CAN TAKE IT IT IS O. K. 
EVERYBODY CONFESSES TO 
YOU HAVE 
DONE IT YOU HAVE DONE IT AND IT 
IS O. K. BUT IT IS NOT

TOMORROW ON BREAKFAST AND I THINK 
HE WILL BE DELIGHT TO BE HERE 
NOW BIT OF PEACE AND QUIET WHO 
NEEDS THE GYM WHEN YOU CAN SIT BACK 
AND CRANK UP THE STEREO LISTENING 
TO CERTAIN TYPES OF MUSIC CAN 
REDUCE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE 
ACCORDING TO NEW RESEARCH MUSIC 
WITH LEG LAR SLOW RHYTHM SUCH AS 
CLASSICAL INDIA RAGA OR CELTIC 
MUSIC WAS THE MOST SOOTHING HERE 
IS A LITTLE SAMPLE FOR YOU 
MUSIC THERAPIST BEN JOINS US 
TOGETHER WITH DOCTOR ROSEMARY LEONARD 
BEN TELL US WHAT IT IS IT IS LIKE 
BEING MUSIC THERAPIST 
AS A A 
MUSIC THERAPIST I WORK WITH ALL 
SORTS OF PEOPLE ADULTS WITH 
LEARNING DISABILITIES ADULTS WITH 
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS WHEN PIM 
WHEN PEOPLE SAY MUSIC THERAPISTS 
YOU MAY WANT A BIT OF THAT 
WHAT CAN HELP PEOPLE 
THIS RESEARCH 
IS ABOUT RECEPTIVE MUSIC AND 
LISTENING TO PEOPLE MY VIEW IS TEN 
MINUTES OF THAT I MIGHT GET 
MURDEROUS MURDEROUS BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT WORKS 
WE KNOW THAT THINGS LIKE INDIAN 
CLASSICAL RAGA THEY CAN BE 
SOOTHING AND FOR MORNING OR EVENING 
TIME BUT THEY CAN BE TO STIMULATE 
AND BRING US OUT OF OURSELVES 
THAT'S WHAT WHAT MUSIC THERAPY DOES 
IT IS THE ACT OF MAKING MUSIC WHICH 
IS DIFFERENT TO WHAT IT IS THAT 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW 
ROSEMARY WHAT'S THE MEDICAL 
RESEARCH BEHIND THIS DOES IT HELP 
TO LOWER YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE WELL WELL IT WAS A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
BUT GOOD RESEARCH THEY MEASURED 
THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE AS THEY WERE 
WACKING AROUND AND WALKING AROUND 
AND WE WERE WEARING MONITORS THEY 
MADE A GROUP OF PEOPLE LIE DOWN AND 
DO ABNOMINAL EXERCISES AT THE SAME 
TIME IT WAS SLOW UP AND DOWN AND 
THEY HAD A GROUP WHO WERE DOING THE 
ABDOMINAL AND THE DEEP BREATHING 
AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE LISTENING 
TO THE MUSIC AS WELL HAD A 
SIGNIFICANT LOWERING OF THEIR BLOOD 
PRESSURE PRESSURE THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO ONLY HAD 
SLIGHTLY RAISED BLOOD PRESSURE 
THAT'S GOOD NEWS BECAUSE THAT GROUP 
OF PEOPLE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY 
SYMPTOMS AND THEY REALLY TAKING 
BLOOD PRESSURE PILLS CAN HAVE SIDE 
EFFECTS AND IT IS GOOD TO KNOW THAT 
IF SOMEONE COMES IN AND I FIND THEY 
HAVE GOT SLIGHTLY HIGH BLOOD 
PRESSURE AND THEY SAY IS THERE 
ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR MYSELF I CAN 
SAY YES HALF AN HOUR OF MUSIC 
EVERY DAY AND IT REALLY WILL MAKE 
A DIFFERENCE 
LET'S HAVE LITTLE LISTEN 
I THINK THAT'S CELTIC MUSIC 
IS THIS THE SORT OF THING YOU PLAY 
DO YOU PLAY IT EXACTLY EXACTLY IT IS NOT A C. D. IT IS PHYSICALLY 
HAVING DRUM KITS HAVING PIANO 
HAVING GUITARS BUT IT IS NOT A 
LESSON THE IDEA IS PEOPLE DON'T 
HAVE TO HAVE ANY PRIOR KNOWLEDGE 
THEY CAN COME IN AND MAKE A SOUND 
WHEN PEOPLE ARE HAVING DIFFICULTIES 
TALK BEING THEIR HEALTH PROBLEMS 
TALKING ABOUT ANY SOCIAL OR 
EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS MUSIC IS A 
LANGUAGE THAT THEY CAN ACCESS 
QUICKLY AND OUR JOB AS MUSIC 
THERAPISTS IS TO GIVE THEM PHRASES 
AND SENTENCES GIVE THEM THE 
LANGUAGE TO USE L. THINK WHAT IS 
FASCINATING ABOUT THIS RESEARCH 
THERE IS ANOTHER ANOTHER REPORT IN 
THE TIMES TODAY MUSIC CAN AFFECT 
YOUR TASTE BUDS AND GET YOU READY 
FOR 
IS THERE 
IF YOU LISTEN TO FOR HEAVY MUSIC YOU CAN IT WILL KIND 
OF PREPARE YOU FOR HEAVIER WINE 
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS ANYTHING 
THERE IS LOT ABOUT THE 
NEUROLOGICAL RESPONSES 
IT STANDS TO REASON BECAUSE YOU 
LISTEN TO ROCK MUSIC DANCE MUSIC 
IT GETS YOU GOING SO OTHER KINDS 
OF MUSIC WILL SOOTHE YOU 
MUSIC HAS AN AFFECT ON YOUR 
EMOTIONS IT CAN MAKE YOU HAPPY IT 
CAN ALSO VERY MUCH RELAX YOU AND 
CLEARLY THE RELAXATION EFFECT CAN 
HAVE PHYSICAL AFFECT ON YOUR BODY 
AND REDUCE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE 
WHICH IS GREAT 
IT IS LOVELY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO 
LISTEN TO MORE MORE MUSIC 
THIS IS INDIAN RAGA NOW 
WE HAVE AN E. MAIL FROM STEVE WHO 
SAYS HE HAD ME FOR FOURTEEN YEARS AND IT 
GOT WORSE ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO AND 
HE REALLY DOES FIND THAT MUSIC 
HELPS BECAUSE IT LOWERS HIS STRESS 
LEVELS WHATEVER ME MAY OR MAY NOT 
BE IT DOES SEEM TO REACT BADLY TO 
ANY STRESSFUL SITUATION AND JUST 
TAKING YOURSELF AWAY FROM IT AND 
LISTENING TO MUSIC CALMS THINGS 
DOWN I SUPPOSE IT CAN WORK FOR 
OTHER ILLNESSES CAN'T IT 
I WOULD 
IMAGINE EVERY STRESS RELATED 
ILLNESS AND IN SOME PEOPLE SLIGHTLY 
RAISED BLOOD PRESSURE IS A REACTION 
TO STRESS ANY STRESS RELATED 
ILLNESS LISTENING TO MUSIC BUT 
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN AND GIVE YOUR A 
DESCENT LENGTH OF TIME WE ARE 
SAYING A FEW SEBLEDS AND IT IS 
HAVING SECONDS AND IT IS HAVING 
AN EFFECT L. KNOW YOU SAID WITH 
SOME OF US OF WHAT AN HOUR AND IT 
WOULD DRIVE YOU CRAZY THIS 
RESEARCH WAS DONE WITH SLOW MUSIC 
DOES IT HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS IF 
YOU LIKE ROCK MUSIC CAN THAT CALM 
YOU DOWN 
EXACTLY L. HAVE MUSICAL 
STICKING PLASTERS THAT I USE AT 
DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE DAY AND IT 
IS DOWN DOWN TO MY TASTES I'M A 
BIG FAN OF INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC 
THAT CELTICY MUSIC WOULD GET ME 
WOUND UP QUICKLY BUT FOR A LOT OF 
PEOPLE THAT WOULD WORK AND FOR A 
CONDITION LIKE ME I CAN IMAGINE 
LISTENING TO HALF AN HOUR OF MUSIC 
GIVES YOU A FOCUS GIVES YOU ALL 
SORTS OF WAYS OF STRUCTURING THAT 
TIME AND I CAN IMAGINE THAT WOULD 
BE HELPFUL IN THOSE CONDITIONS 
WE ARE ALL TALKING A GOOD DEAL MORE 
SLOWLY AN AIR OF CALM HAS 
DESCENDED OVER THE STUDIO YOU WILL 
NEED TO BE CALM THE WEATHER IS 
GOING TO GET WORSE IT IS GOING TO 
CHANGE WE HAVE GOT SOME RAIN 
SPREADING UP FROM THE SOUTH LATER 
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW BUT TODAY 
THERE IS QUITE LOT OF CLOUD 
AROUND SOME OF US WILL SEE SOME 
SUNSHINE BUT IT IS STILL RATHER 
BREEZY THE NORTH EASTERLY BREEZE 
IS TAKEN THE EDGE OF THE 
TEMPERATURES GENERALLY WE HAVE 
SOME THICKER CLOUD TO THE WEST IT 
IS BRIGHTER WESTERN SCOTLAND 
SEEING A BRIGHT START OF THE DAY 
FOR CENTRAL AND EASTERN ENGLAND 
THERE IS MORE CLOUD WITH SOME 
BREAKS AND SUNSHINE WE HAVE JUST 
HAD A SHOWER IN KENT AS WE REPORT 
TO THE SOUTH WEST HERE TO WE'RE 
ENJOYING SOME PLEASANT SUNSHINE 
MARK AS WE WHIP OVER AS WE WHIP 
OVER THROUGH THE DAY LOT OF THE 
CLOUD WILL TEND TO THIN AND WE WILL 
SEE SOME SUNSHINE SOME OF IT AS 
IT PUSHES SLOWLY BACK TOWARDS THE 
NORTH SEA WILL STICK TO THE COAST 
THAT WILL HOLD THE TEMPERATURE DOWN 
LATER IN THE AFTERNOON WE WILL SEE 
FURTHER SHOWERS ANYWHERE FROM 
HAMPSHIRE WEST OVERNIGHT YOU WILL 
NOTICE THE RAIN STARTING TO PUSH 
ACROSS SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND 
AND STARTING TO SHOW ITS HAND 
ACROSS WALES AS WELL NOT A 
PARTICULARLY COLD NIGHT AT CLOUDY 
START TOMORROW THE BEST OF THE 
BREAKS IN THE WEST THE RAIN BAND 
CONTINUES TO PUSH ACROSS SOUTHERN 
ENGLAND BEHIND IT SOME SHOWERS 
LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IN 
TEMPERATURES JUST A REMINDER 
SOMETHING WE'RE KEEPING CLOSE EYE 
ON IS THE VERY REAL RISK OF SOME 
HEAVY RAIN THROUGH THE EVENING 
TOMORROW WE HAVE IT HAVE AS MUCH AS 
AN INCH OF RAIN IN SOME PLACES

PUBLIC BEFORE BUT NOW THE MOD IS 
OPENING UP ALL ITS EUROPHILE FILES 
FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS ALL OF ITS 
U. S. ALL FILES U. F. O. FILES 
THE OUTSTANDING THING IS THAT IT 
BECOMES QUITE OBVIOUS THAT LITTLE 
ACTION WAS TAKEN IF ANYTHING ON 
THESE REPORTS YOU CAN ALMOST PUT 
YOURSELF IN THE SEAT OF THE DESK 
OFFICERS AT THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 
THEY MUST HAVE RECEIVED SCORES OF 
THESE REPORTS MONTH AFTER MONTH 
ON AVERAGE TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED PER YEAR IT 
IS QUITE CLEAR THEY DID NOT HAVE 
THE RESOURCES TO FOLLOW THEM UP 
THERE ARE TWO REPORTS OF THEIR 
ENCOUNTERS WITH ALIENS BOTH OF 
THEM ARE FROM ON RELIABLE SOURCES 
ONE WAS FROM AN ELDERLY MAN IN ALL 
THE SWETE FISHING LATE AT NIGHT AT 
THE CANAL AND SAID HE WAS INVITED 
ON BOARD BY LITTLE GREEN MEN 
AIRLINE PILOTS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN 
NONE OF THE CLAIMS FROM MORE 
CREDIBLE WITNESSES SUCH AS AIRLINE 
PILOTS WERE EVER INVESTIGATED ONE 
U. F. O. RESEARCHER TOLD RUTH SHE MIGHT 
BE VISITED BY STRANGE MEN SHE WAS 
SCEPTICAL BUT THEN HER NEIGHBOUR 
GAVE FOR A MESSAGE 
THERE WERE 
THREE GENTLEMEN DRESSED IN BLACK 
SUITS DRIVING A BEAUTIFUL BLACK 
SHINY CARP KNOCKING ON THE DOOR FOR 
ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BUT THERE WERE 
I HAVE NO IDEA THERE WERE MEN IN 
BLACK WHETHER IT WAS THE MEN IN 
BLACK THAT IS ANOTHER QUESTION I 
WILL NEVER KNOW 
ANOTHER MYSTERY LIKE THE MANY IN 
THE FILES 
YOU F. X. U. F. O. EXPERT TIMOTHY GOOD 
JOINS US YOU HAVE LOOKED THROUGH 
THE FILES 
THERE ARE HUNDREDS 
PROBABLY SEVERAL THOUSAND PAGES IN 
TOTAL THIS IS THE FIRST OF A BATCH 
DUE TO BE RELEASED OVER THE NEXT 
THREE YEARS 
DID HE TELL YOU 
ANYTHING YOU DID NOT KNOW 
NO L. L. 
WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE SOME OF THE 
REPORTS A VERY LONG REPORT YOU 
MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THE GUY WHO 
ALLEGEDLY HAD CONTACT WITH ALIEN 
BEINGS AT ALDERSHOT L. INVESTIGATED 
THAT CASE AND I CONCLUDED IT WAS 
ABSOLUTELY GENUINE L. SUPPLIED THE 
MOD WITH A LENGTHY REPORT YOU YOU CLAIM WHAT THEY ARE REVEALING NOW 
IS ONLY PART OF THE STORY THERE IS 
TOP SECRET STUFF 
ABSOLUTELY TOP SECRET AND ABOVE 
TOP SECRET THEIR CLASSIFICATIONS 
ARE BOUGHT TOP SECRET AS EARLIER 
NINETEEN FIFTY ACCORDING TO THE CANADIAN 
GOVERNMENT THE SUBJECT WAS 
CLASSIFIED HIGHER THAN THE HYDROGEN 
BOMB AND IT REMAINS THE MOST 
SENSITIVE SUBJECT IN INTELLIGENCE 
WHY WOULDN'T THEY TELL US BECAUSE BECAUSE OF OVERREACTION THEY DON'T WANT TO 
TELL US ABOUT THE ASSETS THEY HAVE 
ACQUIRED THE AMERICANS HAVE 
ACQUIRED EXTRA TERRESTRIAL CRAFT 
THEY DON'T WANT NEW FORMS OF 
WEAPONRY WHICH THEY HAVE DISCOVERED 
AS RESULT OF STUDYING ALIEN 
TECHNOLOGY TO BE RELEASED INTO THE 
PUBLIC DOMAIN SO I'M IN SYMPATHY 
WITH THEM NOT RELEASING BOT LOT 
OF THE ABOVE TOP SECRET INFORMATION 
SOME WILL SAY THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT 
INCIDENTS GARETH IN NORTH WALES 
TALKS ABOUT AN INCIDENT AT CHICAGO 
O'HARE AIRPORT LAST YEAR 
IT WAS IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN A U. F. O. 
APPEARED HOOVERED OVER TERMINAL 
C. SEVENTEEN OF UNITED AIRLINES 
HOW DO WE KNOW IT WAS A U. F. O. 
BECAUSE IT WAS REPORTED AS AS SUCH 
BY MANY PILOTS AND PERSONNEL ON THE 
GROUND WHO SAW IT CLEARLY AND WHEN 
IT DEPARTED IT WENT UP VERTICALLY 
AND LEFT A HOLE IN THE CLOUD BASE 
WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW THIS 
THIS WAS 
PUBLISHED IN THE TIMES WEATHER 
SECTION SECTION WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE RADAR 
DETECTING TWO CRAFT MILE LONG 
FLYING OVER THE THE CHANNEL 
ISLANDS 
TWO PILOTS REPORTED A MILE ISLANDS LONG U. F. O. THERE WERE TWO OF THESE 
OBJECTS OBJECTS WHY HAVEN'T WE GOT PICTURES SADLY SADLY NO ONE TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS THAT'S 
UNFORTUNATE BUT A SIMILAR INS 
INCIDENT OCCURRED IN TEXAS THIS 
YEAR WHEN A MILE WIDE CRAFT WAS 
SEEN BY MANY WITNESSES ON THE 
GROUND INCLUDING A QUALIFIED PILOT 
OF ALL THE PLANETS IN THE UNIVERSE 
WHY DO THEY KEEP PICK PICKING OURS

LIGHT YEARS AROUND AND SOME OF THEM 
HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN THIS 
PLANET PLANET O. K. O. K. TIMOTHY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
