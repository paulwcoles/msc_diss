HEY EVERYBODY HOW YOU DOING

AH HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO READY STEADY COOK 
GREAT FOOD COMING YOUR WAY IN A MATTER OF MINUTES WITH FOOD THAT THE CHEFS HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE 
LET'S WELCOME THEM AND OUR GUESTS 
FIRST UP IN THE RED KITCHEN WE HAVE CHEF JAMES TANNER JOINED BY 
FORMER WORLD RUGBY CHAMPION MATT DAWSON 
AND JOINING CHEF NICK NAIRN IN THE GREEN KITCHEN YEAH WE USED TO SEE HIM SPRINTING DOWN THAT TRACK 
IT CAN ONLY BE THE ONE AND ONLY ROGER BLACK 
GOT OUT OF THAT ONE ALL RIGHT 
HOW ARE YOU DOING YOU LIKE THAT 
AH DEAR OH MASTERCHEF CHAMPION 
DO YOU FEEL WALKING ON TO THIS SHOW YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE A WINNER STRAIGHT OFF 
NO WAY NO WAY 
WE HAD TO GRAFT HARD BOTH MYSELF AND ROGER HAD TO WORK VERY VERY HARD 
IT WAS BRILLIANT THOUGH ALWAYS NICE TO WIN 
I KNOW WELL LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR INGREDIENTS SEE WHAT YOU GOT 
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A LOOK AT THAT TO FIND OUT WHETHER OUR CHEF CAN 
COME UP WITH SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING PLENTY FOR YOU 
O. K. TELL US WHAT YOU'VE BROUGHT ALONG HERE THEN MATT 
ACTUALLY THIS IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT I WOULD FIND IN MY FRIDGE REGULARLY 
PARMA HAM I WOULD USE THAT RATHER THAN BACON AND MIX IT WITH LOADS OF OTHER BITS AND PIECES 
YEAH I'M ALLOWED TO EAT LOADS OF STEAK NOW THAT I'M RETIRED 
SO IT'S SOMETHING YOU LITERALLY HAD TO AVOID ALWAYS 
ER NOT TOTALLY BUT IT WOULD BE MORE CHICKEN FISH RATHER THAN 
TAKE TOO LONG TO DIGEST THAT 
THAT'S VERY TRUE 
THIS IS MY VICE 
THAT IS MY VICE CAMBOZOLA IT IS MY VICE 
IT'S A PRETTY MEAN CHEESE OH A BIT LATE NIGHT 
DESSERTS NO CHEESE YES LOVELY 
AND SOME CHESTNUT MUSHROOMS THERE YOU GO MUSHROOMS RICE BROCCOLI AND THE OLD BANANA SHALLOT 
HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND THEN MATT 
TEN POINT OH FOUR 
OH IT'S A LITTLE BIT OVER 
BUT HE'S A CHAMPION WE'RE NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH HIM ARE WE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OH NO 
COME ON THEN CHEF TELL US WHAT YOU THINK OF THAT BRILLIANT BAG 
DID I TRY AND PAD THAT OUT LONG ENOUGH FOR YOU NO NO THAT'S GOOD 
YEAH MY BRAIN'S TICKING OVER 
I CAN HEAR IT UM O. K. 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE SOME OF THE CHEESE TAKE SOME OF THE MUSHROOMS 
WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING CALLED A MUSHROOM DUXELLE WHERE WE SWEAT IT OFF WITH THE SHALLOTS AND GARLIC 
WE BLITZ THEM UP WE'RE GOING TO ADD THE CHEESE I WAS GOING TO DO THE STEAK WITH A CHEESE CRUST 
BUT I'M GOING TO GO FOR IT AND DO A BEEF WELLINGTON 
SO WRAP IT IN SOME PASTRY WE'LL MAKE SOME PASTRY AND DO A BEEF WELLINGTON 
WE CAN DO OBVIOUSLY A NICE SIDE OF RICE INCORPORATING THE BROCCOLI THE REST OF THE MUSHROOMS 
SOME OF THE PARMA HAM WILL BE USED TO WRAP AROUND THE STEAK SO IT DOESN'T BLEED INTO THE PASTRY 
ALL WILL BE EXPLAINED 
WE'LL DO A NICE BROCCOLI SALAD WITH CRISPY PARMA HAM AS WELL AND WE'LL 
LEAVE IT FOR NOW THERE'S ABOUT TWELVE ITEMS THERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
I'VE GOT THE FEELING I AM GOING TO BE INVOLVED YES YOU ARE 
WE WANT YOU TO MAKE YOUR OWN DISH 
BOTH YOU AND ROGER FOR THE MOMENT THOUGH LADIES AND GENTLEMAN LET'S HEAR IT FOR MATT AND JAMES 
HOW ARE YOU DOING VERY WELL 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT THE CHALLENGE TODAY 
I'M GOOD BUT DAWSON WAS QUITE IMPRESSIVE ON MASTERCHEF SO THIS IS MY CHANCE FOR REVENGE 
AND IT IS SWEET IT WILL BE SWEET 
COME ON THEN WITHOUT HESITATION LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE INGREDIENTS 
SO 
A LOVELY RACK OF LAMB RACK OF LAMB FAB 
I JUST LOVE RACK OF LAMB I LOVE NOT JUST BECAUSE IT TASTES GREAT BUT IT LOOKS GREAT AS WELL 
SO THERE'S THAT I PUT THE ASPARAGUS IN 
I ALWAYS WONDER WITH ASPARAGUS BECAUSE I SIMPLY DO IT AS A STARTER 
I WANTED TO SEE HOW ELSE IT CAN BE DONE NICELY 
O. K. NEW IDEAS FOR YOU YEAH GORGEOUS CARROTS 
A BIT OF APRICOTS AND PINE NUT KERNELS BECAUSE MY WIFE LIKES IT 
SHE ALWAYS SAYS TO ME CHUCK THAT IN THE FOOD AND I NEVER REALLY KNOW WHAT IT CAN GO WITH AND WHAT IT CAN'T 
MY WIFE SAYS THE SAME THING I END UP PUTTING THEM IN THE SALAD 
A BIT OF A NUTTY EXPERIENCE IN MY HOUSE JUST LIKE YOU ROGER ABSOLUTELY HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND 
WELL I WENT A LITTLE BIT HIGHER ACTUALLY I WENT TEN POINT ONE OH AH 
BUT LOOK AT THOSE INGREDIENTS LOOK AT THE LAMB 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEN CHEF THESE ARE FANTASTIC INGREDIENTS 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WE'LL TAKE SOME OF THE CHOPS OFF THESE 
AND WE'LL COOK THEM WITH A LITTLE CRUST A NICE CRUNCHY HERBY CRUST MADE WITH PINE NUTS 
THE REST AS A RACK OF LAMB AND ONE OF THE BEST THINGS 
WITH RACK OF LAMB IS A GRATIN DAUPHINOISE THINLY SLICED POTATO 
INSTEAD OF USING GARLIC TO FLAVOUR IT WE'LL USE LEMON ZEST GO WITH ME ON THIS ONE 
WE'LL DO A REALLY NICE RED WINE GRAVY 
WE'LL CHARGRILL SOME OF THE ASPARAGUS 
AND DO IT WITH A NICE POACHED EGG AND A LITTLE HOLLANDAISE ON THERE 
I THINK WE'LL POACH THESE APRICOTS IN A CARDAMOM SCENTED SYRUP 
AND WE'LL MAKE LITTLE CITRUS MOUSSE TO GO WITH THEM AS WELL AND 
THEY ARE SERIOUSLY SWEATING OVER THERE 
WHO NEEDS MASTERCHEF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS ALL HAPPENS IN TWENTY MINUTES 
LET'S HEAR IT FOR ROGER AND NICK 
O. K. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NOW 
OUR CHEFS GET TWENTY MINUTES TO BRING THOSE IDEAS ALIVE 
LET'S SEE IF IT'S ACHIEVABLE WHEN WE SIMPLY SAY READY STEADY COOK 
UP AND RUNNING THE HEAT IS ALREADY RISING IN THE KITCHEN HERE AT READY STEADY COOK 
WE'VE GOT TWO FORMER FINALISTS FROM MASTERCHEF 
SO THEY ARE EQUALLY WANTING TO WIN 
THEY'VE REALLY GOT THE BIT BETWEEN THEIR TEETH THE CHEFS HAVE SOME FABULOUS GOURMET INGREDIENTS 
FIRST UP FILLET STEAK WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO THEN CHEF 
FILLET STEAK REALLY NICE 
I'LL GET THIS ON AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
I AM GOING TO SEAR OFF THE FILLET AND I'M GOING TO TRIM IT UP 
AND INCORPORATE A LITTLE BIT OF IT INTO A SALAD LIKE I SAID 
WITH THE CRISPY PARMA HAM I'M GOING TO FLATTEN IT OUT SLIGHTLY 
LOVELY MARBLING OF FAT THROUGH IT LOVELY 
IS THAT WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD LOOK FOR DEFINITELY 
BUT WITH FILLET STEAK IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AS AGED AS MUCH AS AN ENTRECOTE OR SIRLOIN STEAK 
SO WHEN YOU SEE TWENTY EIGHT DAY STEAKS IT'S NOT USUALLY FILLET THAT'S THAT LONG 
ALL RIGHT THAT MEANS IT WILL BREAK DOWN TOO MUCH 
IT COULD GO A BIT TOUGH ON YOU O. K. 
THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU'RE BUYING FILLET STEAK 
WHEN YOU GO TO THE BUTCHERS EVEN SUPERMARKETS NOW HAVE GOT AGED MEAT HAVE A THINK ABOUT THAT 
RIGHT I NEED TO BANG UP OF A BIT OF PASTRY AND ALSO IN THE MEANTIME I'VE SEASONED THE STEAK 
I NEED TO GET THE PAN SERIOUSLY HOT O. K. 
MATT AT YOUR BUTCHER'S OR DO YOU BUY YOUR MEAT FROM A SUPERMARKET 
NO DEFINITELY THE BUTCHER'S FISHMONGER'S MARKET FOR VEG 
HAS IT ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY 
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED FROM THE SHOW THE QUALITY IS 
PARAMOUNT ABSOLUTELY 
IT CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO THE WAY YOUR FOOD TASTES FANTASTIC 
ALL RIGHT WE'LL TALK AGAIN O. K. CHEF WHAT'S THE NEXT PROCESS SIMPLE PASTRY SOME PLAIN FLOUR 
I AM GOING TO RUB IN THE FAT THE BUTTER 
WE'RE GOING TO BIND IT WITH AN EGG I NEED QUITE A TAUT PASTRY 
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THE STEAK TO BLEED OUT INTO IT SO 
FIRST WE RUB THE TWO INGREDIENTS TOGETHER 
YEAH IF I CAN GET THIS MACHINE WORKING 
O. K. AND THEN IN WITH AN EGG ONCE IT'S GONE TO A BREADCRUMB STAGE 
O. K. SO WE'LL KEEP THAT GOING FOR A MOMENT 
ALWAYS BUTTER OR ANY TIME YOU'D USE OLIVE OIL INSTEAD 
YOU CAN DO BUT IF I USED OLIVE OIL IN THIS ONE IT'S A BIT GREASY 
IT WILL REACT WITH THE STEAK AND THE FAT FROM PARMA HAM SO I WOULDN'T 
O. K. A COUPLE OF MINUTES GONE ALREADY GENTLEMEN 
O. K. SO IN WITH THE RICE 
MATT I'VE GOT YOU A PAN OVER HERE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE O. K. 
MATT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE MAKING A SOUP TODAY AS WELL 
O. K. SO THAT'S A NICE CHAMPIGNON MUSHROOM SOUP 
HE'S DOING BROCCOLI HE'S CUTTING MUSHROOMS BECAUSE I NEED THEM 
O. K. MAKE A LOOK STUPID 
SORRY I TELL YOU WHAT YOUR BREADCRUMBS ARE THERE CHEF 
THE FLOUR'S LOOKING GOOD 
AND JUST TO SHOW YOU GUYS WHAT HE MEANS ABOUT THE BREADCRUMB STAGE 
LOOK AT THAT YOU CAN SEE IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FINE BREADCRUMB 
HE'S GOING TO BIND THAT WITH A LITTLE EGG 
TO PULL THAT TOGETHER AND WE'LL HAVE A LOVELY RICH PASTRY 
LET'S GO AND SEE HOW NICK'S GETTING ON WITH THAT LOVELY RACK OF LAMB 
ALL RIGHT IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING 
WE SEE THIS IN OUR SUPERMARKETS OR IF YOU GO ALONG TO YOUR BUTCHER 
WHAT SHALL I DO WITH IT SOMETIMES IT'S INTIMIDATING WITH THE BONES TELL US ABOUT THE RACK OF LAMB O. K. 
WHAT WE HAVE DONE WE'VE JUST TAKEN OFF THE CHOPS HERE THREE CHOPS 
WHAT WE'LL DO WITH THE RACK IS ROAST IT JUST DRY PAN SKIN SIDE DOWN 
A BIT OF SEASONING A BIT OF SALT AND A BIT OF PEPPER IN THERE 
ONCE THE FATS START TO RUN IT'LL GO IN THE OVEN 
IT'LL TAKE EIGHT MINUTES TO COOK OUT 
IN HERE WE'VE GOT HALF MILK HALF CREAM SALT PEPPER 
ROGER'S JUST ZESTED THE ZEST OF ONE LEMON IN HERE 
AS THAT COMES UP TO THE BOIL I'M JUST PUTTING THINLY SLICED POTATOES 
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO PEEL THE POTATOES FOR GRATIN DAUPHINOISE 
GOODNESS IS ONLY SKIN DEEP I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT GRATIN 
YEAH YEAH YEAH I'LL TELL SOMETHING ABOUT GRATIN DAUPHINOISE IN A LOT OF RECIPES 
WE TELL YOU TO WASH THE POTATOES TO TAKE THE STARCH OFF THE OUTSIDE 
ALL YOU DO THEN IS YOU LOSE THE THING THAT'S GOING TO THICKEN THIS UP WHICH IS THE STARCH 
AND GLUE IT TOGETHER SO YOU MUST LEAVE THEM NICE AND STARCHY 
THE STARCH WILL THICKEN IT AND HOLD IT TOGETHER 
ROGER ARE YOU PICKING UP ANY TIPS HERE MATE ARE YOU EAVESDROPPING ON THIS 
YES WELL ACTUALLY I WAS JUST DOING THIS A FAB JOB OVER THERE 
AND A LITTLE BIT MORE 
FOUR MINUTES GONE GENTLEMEN 
AND THERE IS NO CHEESE IN GRATIN DAUPHINOISE EITHER 
IN THIS ONE IN THIS GRATIN HERE 
INSTEAD OF USING GARLIC WE'VE USED THE LEMON ZEST WHICH IS GOING TO ADD 
A CITRUS THING IN TO THE LAMB DISH 
AND OTHER THINGS YOU COULD PUT IN CAN YOU INFUSE A LITTLE HERB IN THERE A ROBUST HERB 
YEAH A BIT OF THYME WOULD BE NICE WHERE SHALL WE PUT THOSE 
PUT THOSE INTO A TRAY AND OIL THEM UP STICK THEM ON TO THAT TRAY OLIVE OIL ON TO THERE 
ROLL THEM IN OLIVE OIL AND THEN THEY GO INTO THAT CHARGRILL PAN 
THAT WE'LL SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER SUPERB HOW MUCH OLIVE OIL 
JUST RUB IT ALL IN AND THEN RUB IT ON WITH SALT AND PEPPER 
IN HERE WE'VE STARTED THE SAUCE FOR THE RED WINE GRAVY 
RED WINE IF YOU COULD SPRINKLE A BEEF STOCK CUBE IN THERE FOR ME AINS THAT WOULD BE GREAT O. K. 
ABOUT HALF A STOCK CUBE IN THERE 
AND I'LL QUICKLY SHOW YOU WHAT WE'VE GOT IN THE OVEN LOVELY 
PUT THEM INTO THE CHARGRILL PAN THAT WAY AT RIGHT ANGLES 
SORRY PUT THEM INTO THIS CHARGRILL PAN DO I SEASON THEM NOW OR IN THERE SEASON THEM IN THERE 
LOVELY NOW ROGER THERE WE ARE THE FINAL OF MASTERCHEF I KNOW 
TALK ABOUT PRESSURE I TELL YOU I KNOW WHAT IS MORE PRESSURE 
LINING UP IN THE OLYMPICS TO RUN THAT HAS SIX HUNDRED METRES OR THAT FOUR HUNDRED METRES 
SIX HUNDRED METRES WOULD BE GOOD 
OR GETTING INVOLVED IN MASTERCHEF JUST BEING IN THE FINAL 
WELL I KNEW I WAS GOOD AT RUNNING AND THAT IS WHAT I DID 
BUT COOKING IT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND I HAVE NEVER 
IT'S THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DONE ON TELEVISION MASTERCHEF 
BECAUSE THE WORST THING IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST ROUND NOT THE FINAL IT GETS EASIER AS YOU GO ALONG 
BECAUSE YOU WALK INTO THIS STUDIO AND THERE ARE THESE MYSTERY INGREDIENTS 
AND YOU HAVE FIFTY MINUTES OR WHATEVER TO COME UP WITH A TWO COURSE MEAL 
WHICH YOU'LL BE JUDGED ON I HAD NIGHTMARES ABOUT THAT 
OH IT WAS AWFUL WHY DID YOU ACTUALLY DO IT 
BECAUSE I LOVE A CHALLENGE 
I WANTED TO BECOME A BETTER COOK 
AND IT WORKED BUT IT WAS JUST THE CHALLENGE OF DOING SOMETHING OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE 
AND I THINK EVERYONE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO COOK BETTER 
AND TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO BE AROUND THESE GREAT CHEFS AND TO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE WAS FANTASTIC 
WHAT ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF JUST THROW THEM ALL IN 
DROP THEM ALL IN AT ONCE THAT'S IT GIVE THAT PAN A SHAKE THAT'S LOVELY 
WHAT RECIPE WERE YOU MOST PROUD OF OH MY PIECE DE RESISTANCE WAS A LEMON SOUFFLE WHICH WORKED 
BECAUSE YOU EITHER GET IT RIGHT OR YOU GET IT WRONG 
AND IT CAME OUT OF THE OVEN AND IT WAS THAT PERFECT 
THAT WAS MY MOMENT THAT WAS MY MOMENT 
NICK HAVE YOU GOT A RECIPE YOU ARE PARTICULARLY PROUD OF NICK 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ONE THAT PARTICULARLY STANDS OUT AINS 
I THINK THE THING I AM REALLY PROUD OF 
IS DEVELOPING A STYLE OF PRODUCE BASED COOKING 
I NEED TO GET HIS MAN TO DO SOMETHING 
TAKE THESE APRICOTS HALF OF THEM CHOP THEM INTO QUARTERS 
AND THE OTHER HALF WE'LL MAKE A SUGAR SYRUP IN HERE 
SO I'M GOING TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF CASTER SUGAR 
O. K. WE'VE GOT ASPARAGUS IN THE CHARGRILL PAN

I AM GOING TO USE A VERY SHARP KNIFE GO AS THIN AS POSSIBLE REALLY 
THEN I AM GOING TO FAN IT OUT ACROSS THE PLATE LIME JUICE OVER THE TOP 
A BIT OF LIME ZEST CHILLI FLAKE

BECAUSE THAT IS THE WAY THAT THE GREEKS TRADITIONALLY DO IT 
I'M USING A BIT OF EGG WASH HERE BECAUSE WE WANT A TIGHT SEAL BECAUSE WE'LL BE PUTTING IT INTO OIL 
SOMETIMES THE BUTTER CAN SEPARATE AND THE EDGES OF THE PASTRY CAN CURL UP

NO PROBLEM AT ALL 
JUST FOLDING THESE UP RATHER QUICKLY HERE 
SEALING ALL THIS IN AS QUICK AS I CAN 
AND WE HAVE ALSO GOT A QUICKIE QUESTION TO COME O. K. 
ALL RIGHT AND WE HAVE GOT A QUESTION FROM ONE OF OUR AUDIENCE MEMBERS 
I HAVE TO SAY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AUDIENCE MEMBER 
GUESS WHO IT IS GUESS WHO IT IS NOT TURNER 
IT IS BRIAN TURNER ABSOLUTELY 
O. K. LAST STRAWBERRY GOING IN THERE 
THERE WE ARE LISTEN UP BOYS QUICK QUESTION COMING YOUR WAY 
CHEF BRIAN TURNER WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION TODAY PLEASE 
CHEFS WE ALL KNOW THAT DELIA WHO WE RESPECT AND LOVE FOUR POINT FIVE MINUTES 
HAS NOW GOT A NEW BOOK OUT AND A NEW TELEVISION SERIES ALL ABOUT CHEATING 
DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK SHE'S DOING THE RIGHT THING 
AND WOULD YOU ACTUALLY EAT FROZEN MASHED POTATO AT HOME OR ANYWHERE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED CHEF BRIAN TURNER GENTLEMAN 
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A POISONED CHALICE 
I'M NOT A HUGE FAN OF FROZEN MASHED POTATO BUT I DO CHEAT 
I WOULDN'T CALL IT CHEATING BUT I USE THINGS LIKE CONVENIENCE INGREDIENTS LIKE FILO PASTRY 
LIKE CANNED CHICKPEAS BUT SOME OF THAT STUFF 
USING CARTONS OF READY MADE MEALS TO MAKE AND DRESS IT UP AS SOMETHING ELSE 
I DON'T THINK IS CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE MESSAGES WE ARE TRYING TO GET OUT AS PROFESSIONAL CHEFS 
AND SOME OF THE MESSAGES DELIA HAS BEEN GIVING OUT OVER THE YEARS 
IT GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN BUT I CAN KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHERE SHE IS COMING FROM 
BUT IN TERMS OF PEOPLE HAVE SHORT TIME AND WANT TO DO THINGS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
BUT THERE IS A KIND OF LIMIT AS TO HOW FAR YOU GO THAT IS AS MUCH AS I'M GOING TO SAY 
O. K. JAMES TANNER 
YEAH HE'S RIGHT 
NO I MEAN THE HARD THING IS YOU'RE ASKING US AND AS YOU KNOW WE'RE COOKS 
WE'RE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT FOOD AND TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY 
AS NICK SAID FOR YEARS I GREW UP WATCHING HER TEACHING ME HOW TO COOK 
MY MUM HAS GOT ALL HER BOOKS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
I THINK PART OF IT HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE MARKET FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS 
AND THEIR LIFESTYLES BUT PERSONALLY I WOULDN'T GET PACKET MASHED POTATO AND WARM IT UP 
NOT WHEN I CAN CUT UP A NICE KING EDWARD POTATO 
PUT IT IN A PAN AND STAND THERE AND LOOK AT IT FOR TEN MINUTES INSTEAD OF PINGING IT FOR TWO MINUTES 
YOU CAN DO IT IN THE MICROWAVE IN FIVE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED CHEF BRIAN TURNER 
AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED GUYS I THINK WE'VE ALL HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A DEBATE ABOUT THAT 
YOU'LL ALWAYS GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON READY STEADY COOK 
YOU'RE ALSO GUARANTEED WONDERFUL FOOD WHICH WE'LL HAVE IN A MATTER OF MINUTES 
VERY LITTLE TIME GENTLEMEN LET'S GET ON WITH IT 
ONE POINT FIVE MINUTES TO GO 
THERE'S SOME RASPBERRY SAUCE TO GO WITH YOUR CHOCOLATE SAUCE NICK YEAH
