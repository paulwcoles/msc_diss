THE BIGGEST AND THE STRONGEST 
FOR SPEED ON THE LAND WE START WITH THE FRIENDLY NEIGHBOURHOOD CHEETAH 
WELL WE ALREADY HAVE A SPEEDY GUY ME 
I DO LOVE WATCHING COUSIN BLAKE DO THE CHEETAH THING 
CHEETAHS ARE THE FASTEST LAND ANIMALS OVER A SHORT DISTANCE 
BUT THERE IS NOBODY FASTER ON LAND OVER A LONG DISTANCE 
THAN THE PRONGHORN ANTELOPE 
NOW IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SIZE AND POWER 
LOOK NO FURTHER THAN YOUR OWN SAVANNAH ELEPHANTS 
WE ARE THE LARGEST ANIMALS STRUTTING ABOUT AND 
THE STRONGEST TOO WURR RRR 
SAY YOU NEED A SUPER DUPER ANIMAL TO SAVE ANIMALS IN HIGH PLACES 
I'D IMAGINE THE TALLEST ANIMAL THE GIRAFFE WOULD BE QUITE HELPFUL 
SPOT ON RON 
HEY HE'S PRETTY SMART 
FOR MISSIONS IN THE AIR THE PEREGRINE FALCON IS WELL 
SUPER DUPER FAST 
WHEN THEY DIVE THEY CAN REACH SPEEDS OVER TWO HUNDRED M. P. H. 
THAT'S FASTER THAN BO 
THAT'S FASTER THAN ANY ANIMAL IN THE WORLD YES BUT DOES HE HAVE SPOTS 
WELL NO FOR UNDERWATER MISSIONS 
YOU WOULD CALL ON THE BLUE WHALE FOR THE HEAVY DUTY JOBS 
THEY'RE ALSO THE BIGGEST ANIMAL IN THE WORLD 
WHAT IF WE NEED SPEED IN THE WATER 
THERE'S THE SAILFISH IT MAY LOOK SLOW HERE 
BUT IT CAN SWIM AS FAST AS YOU CAN RUN BO AW 
STOP RIGHT THERE OUR TEAM IS COMPLETE 
REALLY WHO ARE THE NEW MEMBERS OF THE SUPER DUPER ANIMAL SQUAD 
WE COULD USE THAT BLUE WHALE BUT I SUPPOSE THERE ISN'T ONE AROUND 
NO PEREGRINE FALCONS EITHER 
OH WELL I SUPPOSE WE'RE OUT OF LUCK 
RON YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE GETTING A COLD YOU BETTER TAKE CARE OF THAT 
A LITTLE FELLOW LIKE YOU NEEDS TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HIMSELF 
COS YOU'RE SO LITTLE YEAH 
I'M NOT SURE THIS SUPERHERO THING IS RIGHT FOR A LITTLE ONE LIKE YOU 
O. K. 
HMM WHAT IF I TOLD YOU ONE OF THE STRONGEST ANIMALS WAS RIGHT HERE 
UNDER YOUR NOSES AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT 
IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO SHOW THAN TELL 
RIGHT THIS ONE'S CALLED SECRET HEROES OOH 
SECRET SUPER DUPER ANIMALS CAN BE THE MOST SURPRISING CREATURES 
TAKE THE COMMON FLEA A SUPER DUPER FLEA YOU'RE KIDDING 
KARLA IF YOU HAD THE JUMPING POWER OF A FLEA 
YOU COULD JUMP RIGHT OVER THE WATER HOLE 
THAT COULD COME IN HANDY 
THERE ARE SO MANY ANIMALS WITH SUPER DUPER ABILITIES 
FOR JUNGLE MISSIONS IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A CHAMELEON ON YOUR SIDE 
THEY CAN CHANGE COLOUR THAT IS SUPER SNEAKY 
IF YOU'RE SUPER DUPER AFTER DARK 
BATS CAN USE THEIR SONAR TO GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE NIGHT 
MONARCH BUTTERFLIES SOMEHOW MANAGE TO TRAVEL THOUSANDS OF MILES 
WITHOUT GETTING LOST 
WITH A BEAVER ON THE TEAM YOU'D HAVE A SUPER DUPER BUILDER 
HE COULD BUILD OUR SUPER DUPER HIDE OUT 
IF YOU'RE CORNERED UNDER THE WATER 
AN ELECTRIC EEL CAN SHOCK YOUR ENEMIES WITH A ZAP OF ELECTRICITY 
ZAP NONE OF THOSE ARE NEAR HERE MAMA 
YES WHERE'S THIS STRONG GUY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 
THE MILD MANNERED RHINOCEROS BEETLE CAN SUPPORT 
EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES HIS OWN WEIGHT 
YOU MEAN RON YOU MEAN ME 
I MEAN YEAH ME 
YES IF YOU'RE AS MIGHTY AS RON HERE MAXY 
YOU COULD LIFT A FULL GROWN BLUE WHALE ALL BY YOURSELF 
WOW 
RHINOCEROS BEETLES ARE GREAT DIGGERS TOO WOW 
SO JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE'S SMALLER 
IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER 
BO MAX KARLA WHERE DID THEY GO
