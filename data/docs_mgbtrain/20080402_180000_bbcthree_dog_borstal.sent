AND GUNNER IS A FOUR STONE HOME WRECKER 
I JUST WANT TO PULL MY HAIR OUT 
THE OWNERS OF THESE THREE DOGS ARE AT THEIR WITS' END 
IT'S TIME FOR EXTREME MEASURES 
DOG BORSTAL 
THIS IS THE LAST RESORT FOR BAD DOGS 
SET UP IN A SECURE COMPOUND IN A REMOTE PART OF THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
DOG BORSTAL IS RUN BY THREE OF BRITAIN'S TOUGHEST TRAINERS 
I'VE NEVER MET A DOG I CAN'T TRAIN 
EACH TRAINER WILL TAKE ON ONE DOG AND ATTEMPT TO REFORM THEM IN JUST FOUR DAYS 
USING THEIR OWN TRAINING METHODS 
MY GOAL IS TO SHIFT THE POWER BALANCE BACK IN FAVOUR OF THE OWNER 
THAT MEANS THE OWNERS WILL HAVE TO FACE SOME HARSH TRUTHS 
I MAY BE THE ONLY FEMALE HERE BUT I'M NO PUSH OVER 
FOR THESE THREE DOGS THEIR DELINQUENT WAYS ARE ABOUT TO COME TO AN END 
AND THE FIRST OFFENDER IS GEORGE 
A TEN MONTH OLD CHOCOLATE LABRADOR WHICH IN DOG YEARS MAKES HIM 
A TEENAGER 
I'M JUST A TEENAGE DIRT BAG BABY 
MY LIFE HAS CHANGED A LOT SINCE I GOT GEORGE 
GIVE ME IT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THE IDEAL DOG AND THAT HE WOULD BE A COMPANION TO ME 
I COULD TAKE HIM FOR NICE LONG WALKS IN THE EVENING 
STOP IT COME HERE BUT I SPEND ALL MY TIME PICKING UP AFTER HIM WATCHING WHAT HE'S DOING 
SHOUTING AT HIM TO COME BACK TO ME BECAUSE HE'S RUN AWAY 
WITH HER HUSBAND IN THE ARMY IT'S EMMA WHO'S LEFT TO FACE 
GEORGE'S DAILY RITUAL OF ABUSE AND DISOBEDIENCE 
GEORGE 
GEORGE HAS NO RESPECT FOR ME AT ALL 
HE THINKS HE IS MY OWNER 
GEORGE NO STOP 
HE WALKS ALL OVER ME HE RUNS RINGS ROUND ME AND I THINK HE JUST THINKS IT'S FUNNY 
COME HERE IT'S ALL A GAME TO HIM 
I SCREAM I SHOUT GEORGE GET BACK HERE 
AND HE DOESN'T CARE 
GEORGE HAS A HABIT OF GATE CRASHING PEOPLE'S HOUSES UNINVITED 
I'M REALLY SORRY CAN I GET MY DOG 
I'M SO SORRY GEORGE I'M REALLY REALLY SORRY 
IT SEEMS TO BE HIS AMBITION IN LIFE TO DRIVE ME ABSOLUTELY CRAZY 
IF SOMEBODY SAID TO ME THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FROM HAVING A DOG 
I'D HAVE PROBABLY STEPPED BACK A BIT AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT A BIT HARDER OR BOUGHT A FISH OR A HAMSTER 
LIKE ANY GROWING TEENAGER GEORGE IS CONSTANTLY SNACKING BETWEEN MEALS 
HE'S HAD MY MOBILE PHONE THAT'S DIED 
C. D.'S 
MY DESIGNER BOOTS WHICH I WAS VERY VERY UPSET ABOUT 
I THINK THE DAMAGE THAT GEORGE CAUSED IS GOING TO COST US PROBABLY A COUPLE OF GRAND EASY 
RECENTLY GEORGE HAS STARTED TO BECOME INTERESTED IN THE OPPOSITE SEX 
HE'S A BIT OF AN EXHIBITIONIST HE LIKES TO DO IT WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE 
HE DRAGS THINGS INTO THE FRONT ROOM AND PUTS ON A LITTLE SHOW IN FRONT OF THE TELLY 
AND I'M SAT THERE AND IT'S SO EMBARRASSING 
LIKE A SEX MACHINE 
ONCE HE'S GOT THE BLANKETS YOU CAN'T GET THEM OFF HIM THEY'RE HIS 
VERY EMBARRASSING ESPECIALLY WHEN MY MUM AND DAD COME ROUND 
I SIT THERE ABSOLUTELY MORTIFIED AND EMBARRASSED 
DEFINITELY HE'S GOT TO GET IT OUT OF HIS SYSTEM EVERY DAY 
I DON'T THINK HE LIKES ME I THINK IF HE HAD FINGERS HE'D BE STICKING ONE UP AT ME MOST OF THE TIME 
BUT NOW GEORGE IS ABOUT TO COME FACE TO FACE WITH THE HARD MAN OF DOG TRAINING 
THIS IS MIC MARTIN AFTER TWENTY YEARS TRAINING DOGS 
FOR THE POLICE AND THE MILITARY MIC'S AS TOUGH AS OLD BOOTS 
YOU'RE THE SCARY ONE 
HOW ARE YOU DOING I'M FINE HOW ARE YOU WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
EMMA EMMA RIGHT NICE TO MEET YOU 
I'M MIC HERE'S GEORGE 
JUST DON'T LET HIM JUMP UP YOU KNOW 
ALL INMATES OF THE DOG BORSTAL FIRST HAVE TO SURRENDER THEIR DOG DOCUMENTS 
O. K. GEORGE 
THEN IT'S STRAIGHT TO THE VET FOR A MEDICAL 
O. K. EMMA 
YOU'RE JUST COMPLETELY MENTAL AREN'T YOU 
THE TRAINING WILL BE CHALLENGING AND GEORGE NEEDS 
A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH BEFORE HE IS ADMITTED TO BORSTAL 
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN EATING 
HE'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO HANDLE ISN'T HE YES HEIS 
HE'S STILL GOT ALL HIS BITS AND PIECES HE HAS FOR NOW 
I GUARANTEE HE HUMPS GUARANTEE IT 
AND THE SIZE OF THE I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE COULDN'T SIRE FIFTY OTHER DOGS IN A DAY 
WHERE DOES HE NORMALLY SLEEP 
IN THE KITCHEN RIGHT O. K. SO HE'S USED TO SLEEPING ON HIS OWN 
NEXT THE RULES OF THE KENNEL BLOCK 
HAVE A LITTLE LOOK THROUGH THERE SHOUT DOG IN AS LOUD AS YOU CAN 
PULL IT AGAINST YOUR FOOT 
DOG IN THAT'S IT JUST WAIT FOR A REPLY 
THIS MUST BE DONE WITHOUT FAIL 
IN CASE THERE'S A DOG LOOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE 
JUST TAKE HIM IN SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND YOU 
JUST GET INTO THE HABIT OF SHUTTING THE DOOR 
WITH THE FIRST INMATE IN BORSTAL IT'S TIME FOR THE NEXT CANINE OFFENDER 
OH ARE YOU ALL NERVOUS CHARLIE WELL DON'T WORRY I AM TOO 
THIS IS CHARLIE 
A JACK RUSSELL CROSS WHO LOOKS LIKE BUTTER WOULDN'T MELT IN HIS MOUTH 
HE LIVES WITH HIS OWNER HEATHER IN A PEACEFUL SOUTH LONDON TERRACE 
BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING 
CHARLIE'S THE DEVIL DOG INCARNATE 
CHARLIE HAS A VICIOUS REPUTATION 
RIGHT SIT DOWN SIT DOWN 
UNTIL RECENTLY CHARLIE LIVED WITH HEATHER'S SISTER 
MY SISTER IS TERMINALLY ILL AND SO IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT FOR HER TO CARE FOR CHARLIE 
NO NO NO NO 
GIVEN THE CHOICE HEATHER WOULDN'T HAVE A DOG 
IN FACT SHE NEVER WANTED A PET OF ANY SORT 
COME ON SO TO TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF HER I SAID THAT I WOULD TAKE HIM FOR A WEEK 
AND I'VE HAD CHARLIE ABOUT NINE MONTHS NOW 
THE FIRST DAY IN MY HOUSE HE CHOSE THE MOST EXPENSIVE PAIR OF SHOES 
BUT HE DIDN'T JUST CHEW THEM THE ONLY THING LEFT WAS THE SOLE OF THE SHOE 
BEFORE CHARLIE CAME I HAD DINNER PARTIES AND BARBECUES AND GUESTS AND FRIENDS ROUND TO WATCH VIDEOS 
I CAN'T DO THAT 
CHARLIE CHARLIE 
I HAVEN'T GOT A NORMAL LIFE 
I HAVEN'T GOT THE FREEDOM TO OPEN MY OWN FRONT DOOR 
CAN WE BEHAVE 
BUT LEAVING THE HOUSE IS AN EVEN BIGGER NIGHTMARE 
CHARLIE WILL PICK A FIGHT WITH ANYONE 
TWO LEGS FOUR LEGS ANYTHING IS GAME 
CHARLIE 
HE'S GOT A CUTE LITTLE FACE CHARLIE 
LOOKS REALLY SWEET 
AND HE'S QUITE SLY SO HE'LL LOOK AT SOMEONE WRINKLE HIS LITTLE BROW 
WAG HIS TAIL AS IF HE KNOWS THEY'RE GOING TO WALK OVER TO HIM 
AND SAY HELLO AND AS SOON AS THEY DO SNAPPING SNARLING BARKING 
I THINK HE'S RUINED MY LIFE 
I THINK HE'S TAKEN AWAY MY FREEDOM 
I THINK HE'S TAKEN AWAY MY SOCIAL LIFE 
I'M ANXIOUS ALL THE TIME 
I KEEP THE BLINDS CLOSED AND THE T. V. ON 
BECAUSE IF ANYBODY PASSES HE TRIES TO LAUNCH HIMSELF THROUGH THE GLASS 
BECAUSE HE WANTS TO ATTACK WHOEVER'S OUT THERE 
IT WILL BE ME ADAPTING TO HIM 
AND THAT'S AWFUL 
FOR CHARLIE THE HOLIDAY IS FINALLY OVER 
HE'S ABOUT TO MEET HIS MATCH IN LYNNE DAVIES 
A FEARLESS DOG TRAINER WHO WILL TAKE ON EVEN THE MOST VIOLENT OFFENDERS 
NOW BE A GOOD BOY 
HI HEATHER I'M LYNNE AND THIS IS CHARLIE YES 
COME ON COME ON PUPPY 
CHARLIE'S BEEN MUZZLED FOR THE OCCASION 
BUT THE VET'S NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES HOW IS HE GENERALLY 
VICIOUS HE IS VICIOUS 
YEAH HE WOULD BE WITH YOU YEAH 
OVER AT THE KENNEL BLOCK GEORGE IS SETTLING INTO HIS NEW HOME 
AND OWNER EMMA IS COMING TO TERMS WITH MIC'S STRICT REGIMES 
SO I WANT YOU TO USE THE DIARY 
THIS IS YOUR DIARY TO TAKE HOME WITH YOU SO THAT YOU CAN TELL WHOEVER YOU LIVE WITH HOW IT WORKS 
SO KEEP THAT IN YOUR BAG 
EMMA WILL HAVE TO CARRY THE RUCKSACK AT ALL TIMES 
GRAB WHAT YOU CAN 
MIC INSISTS ALL HIS STUDENTS DRESS IN BLACK 
BUT EMMA SEEMS TO HAVE BROUGHT HER ENTIRE WARDROBE 
GOT ANYTHING BLACK YES THAT'S THE ONLY CLOTHES YOU'RE GOING TO NEED BLACK 
O. K. FINE RIGHT THERE WE GO LET'S GO 
THAT'S IT WELL DONE OFF YOU GO 
YOU'RE CRUEL IF YOU CAN'T CARRY IT LEAVE IT 
AT BORSTAL OWNERS MUST LIVE APART FROM THEIR DOGS 
THAT'S YOURS O. K. 
HE'S QUITE SCARY ISN'T HE 
I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME WITH HIM HE'S NOT VERY SYMPATHETIC 
I THINK HE'S GOING TO END UP UPSETTING ME BEFORE THE END OF THE TIME 
TRAINER LYNNE TAKES CHARLIE AND HIS OWNER HEATHER TO THE KENNEL BLOCK 
DOG IN LOVELY 
OH HELLO PUPPY 
O. K. THIS IS CHARLIE'S HOME FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS THIS WAY DARLING 
ONCE CHARLIE IS SAFELY BEHIND BARS HE CAN FINALLY BE RELIEVED OF HIS MUZZLE 
OBLIVIOUS TO WHAT'S AHEAD THE LAST REPROBATE IS BREEZING INTO BORSTAL 
THIS IS GUNNER A STAFFORDSHIRE BULL TERRIER 
OUT WITH HIS RIGHT HAND MAN CLINTON FOR A STROLL IN NORTH LONDON 
GUNNER'S OWNER IS HAPPILY MARRIED TO LISA BUT THE CRACKS ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW 
I JUST WANT TO PULL MY HAIR OUT 
WELCOME TO THE HOUSE OF FUN 
IN THIS HOUSE IT'S GUNNER WHO SETS THE RULES 
HE'S EVEN IN CHARGE OF INTERIOR DESIGN 
WE'VE DECORATED THIS THREE TIMES SINCE WE'VE HAD HIM IN TWO AND A HALF YEARS 
I'VE HAD TO CHANGE DOORS TWICE AND I'VE HAD THE FIRE DOOR 
PUT BACK ON AGAIN BECAUSE HE'S GNAWED AT THE SIDE 
IN THE KITCHEN HE GNAWS AT THE BOTTOM 
WE STARTED COMING HOME AND FINDING GUNNER HAD BEEN BITING 
ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND ALL ROUND THE SIDES OF THE BANISTERS HERE 
IT WAS ALL ROUNDED OFF LIKE THIS YOU KNOW STICKING OUT 
AND HE'S GNAWED HIS WAY ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT 
WE ARE QUITE HOUSE PROUD 
WE LIKE TO KEEP IT CLEAN 
YOU CAN'T HIT HIM SOMETIMES I DO FEEL LIKE THAT I FEEL LIKE 
HITTING HIM BUT YOU CAN'T 
WHEN CLINTON'S OUT ON A JOB LISA'S LEFT TO DEAL WITH GUNNER 
SHE'S ONLY ALLOWED TO WALK GUNNER TO THE END OF THE STREET AND BACK AGAIN AND NEVER OFF THE LEAD 
IF I WAS TO LET HIM OFF HE'D RUN AWAY FROM ME HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO ME 
BUT WITH SUCH SHORT WALKS GUNNER IS LEFT WITH LOTS OF ENERGY IN RESERVE 
IN YOUR BED IN YOUR BED NOW STAY THERE STAY THERE 
YOU'RE A BAD DOG YOU'RE BAD 
GET DOWN I'M NOT PLAYING WITH YOU I'M NOT PLAYING WITH YOU 
I'M NOT PLAYING WITH YOU I END UP CRYING AND I PHONE CLINTON UP AND I BEG HIM WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME 
I WANT YOU TO COME HOME I TRY AND TELL LISA TO BE MORE FIRM WITH HIM 
BUT WHEN I'M AT WORK I CAN'T DO NOTHING I'M PISSED OFF ALL DAY 
I'LL JUST TRY AND SAY LOOK JUST LOCK HIM AWAY 
IF HE DOES GET TO YOU THAT MUCH LOCK HIM AWAY 
GUNNER WON'T BE LOCKED AWAY IN HIS HOUSE WITHOUT A PROTEST 
WHAT'S ALL THIS WHAT'S ALL THIS HE DOES IT OUT OF SPITE 
IT'S LIKE YOU LOCKED ME AWAY I'LL DO THIS THEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO CLEAN UP 
BAD GUNNER BAD 
BAD BAD 
BAD DOG 
MOST OF LISA'S DAY IS SPENT MOPPING UP AFTER GUNNER 
AS SOON AS YOU'VE DONE THE LAST BIT OF DRYING GUARANTEED HE'LL HAVE A PISS 
HEY WHAT'S THAT 
WE'VE HAD SOME HEAVY ROWS OVER IT 
AS I SAID ME OR THE DOG IT'S BEEN THAT ONCE OR TWICE 
GET RID OF THAT DOG 
BUT I CAN'T GET RID OF HIM I CAN'T GET RID OF HIM YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
I WOULD NEVER GIVE HIM TO SOMEONE ELSE 
IF I HAVE TO GET RID OF HIM I'D RATHER HIM GET PUT DOWN 
FOR GUNNER DOG BORSTAL IS THE LAST CHANCE SALOON 
ATTEMPTING TO REFORM GUNNER IS TRAINER ROBERT ELAYNE 
AN EXPERIENCED BEHAVIOURIST WHO CAN READ DOGS AND THEIR OWNERS LIKE A BOOK 
HOW ARE YOU DOING I'M CLINTON NICE ONE MATE 
THIS MUST BE GUNNER THIS IS GUNNER HOW'S HE BEEN ON THE WAY DOWN HE DOESN'T STOP FARTING 
NICE WELL THAT WILL BE SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO 
HELLO I'M LISA NICE TO MEET YOU 
HE'S A BIG BOY ISN'T HE RIGHT OUR NEXT JOB IS TO GET HIM INTO THE KENNELS 
CLINTON HAS BROUGHT ALONG SOME BEERS TO SEE HIM THROUGH THE WEEK 
UNFORTUNATELY EAGLE EYED MIC HAS SPOTTED THEM 
I'LL SAY THANKS TO YOU MATE FOR BRINGING THESE THAT'S GREAT THAT'S GREAT 
DOG IN GOOD THERE YOU GO 
GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY GO STRAIGHT IN 
YES ALWAYS BEFORE YOU LET HIM OFF THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS MAKE SURE THIS DOOR IS SHUT 
SHUT ALL RIGHT 
GUNNER DOESN'T WASTE ANY TIME BEFORE CHRISTENING HIS NEW KENNEL 
LISA'S BACK WITH HER MOP 
WHILE CLINTON HAS A KICK AROUND WITH HIS MATE 
GUNNER IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT I EXPECTED GUNNER WAS GOING TO BE 
HE'S UP FOR IT ALL THE TIME 
HE CAN'T STAND STILL HE'S UP THERE HE'S DOWN THERE 
IT'S LIKE CLINTON'S HERE AND GUNNER'S THERE AND CLINTON'S LIKE OH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
AND THE DOG'S LIKE BRING IT ON 
AND CLINTON'S LIKE YEAH I'LL BRING IT ON THE TWO OF THEM ARE COMPETING ALL THE TIME 
OVER WHO'S GOING TO BE THE GEEZER 
AND I GET A REAL SENSE THAT YOU KNOW HE'S MY BOY 
WE ARE LADS TOGETHER KIND OF THING 
THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF GUNNER'S PROBLEM 
BECAUSE WITHOUT REALISING IT I THINK CLINTON ACTUALLY ENDORSES IT 
COMING OUT WITH ALL THREE DOGS SAFELY LOCKED UP 
THE OWNERS MUST SETTLE IN TO THEIR NEW REGIME 
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT CHARLIE I'M NOT ANY MORE 
HE'S IN A NICE SECURE BRICK BUILT BUILDING 
AND I'VE GOT THIS 
EUW SPIDERS ALREADY 
I'M NOT SHARING MY TENT WITH THAT 
ITS HUGE IT'S ON THE BACK 
HELLO SPIDER OH 
I'M GOING OUT OF THE TENT 
STICK IT UNDER HER PILLOW 
THE TRAINERS HAVE CALLED EVERYONE TO H. Q. FOR A BRIEFING SESSION 
THIS WILL BE A WEEK OF VERY HARD WORK IT WILL BE STRESSFUL 
AT TIMES IT WILL BE VERY UPSETTING 
WE CAN TELL YOU TO LEAVE AT ANY TIME AND WE WILL 
IF WE THINK YOU'RE WASTING OUR TIME 
AGAIN BLOCK HIS ROUTE SO HE CAN'T 
FOR CHARLIE LESSONS START EARLY 
SO THIS IS HIS NEW SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS 
IT'S A CRATE YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING IT'S A CAGE 
THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT HE'S GOING TO SEE AS HIS DEN 
HIS PLACE THAT HE IS LEFT ALONE IN 
IT IS NOT A PUNISHMENT 
FROM NOW ON CHARLIE WILL BE FED ALL HIS MEALS IN THE CRATE 
SO HE'LL QUICKLY LEARN TO SEE IT AS HIS COMFORT ZONE 
THIS GIVES HIM A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WITH IT 
WHENEVER HEATHER HAS VISITORS TO HER HOME 
CHARLIE CAN HAPPILY GO TO HIS CRATE OUT OF HARM'S WAY 
GOOD BOY 
DON'T MAKE TOO MUCH OF A FUSS OF HIM 
HEATHER'S FINDING IT HARD TO LEAVE CHARLIE LOCKED UP 
IN THEIR NINE MONTHS TOGETHER THEY'VE NEVER BEEN APART 
COMING OUT 
I FEEL SORRY FOR HIM 
I JUST WISH HE WOULDN'T GET SO UPSET AND YOU KNOW YAPPY 
HOW CAN YOU BE ATTACHED TO A DOG THAT YOU REALLY DON'T WANT 
BUT HE IS A CUTE LITTLE THING 
IT'S GOT TO IMPROVE HIM AND SO THAT IMPROVES ME 
BUT I SUPPOSE THAT'S HALF THE PROBLEM ME 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE EXPECTED 
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WANTED SOME MAGIC PIXIE DUST TO MAKE IT O. K. 
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO WORK AT THIS AND SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY SHE IS WITH THE DOG 
AND THE WAY THE DOG SEES HER 
AS LONG AS THE DOG UNDERSTANDS THAT SHE'S THE BOSS THERE SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM 
ONCE ALL THE DOGS HAVE BEEN FED THEY MUST BE TAKEN FOR AN EVENING WALK 
MIC MARTIN SUPERVISES PROCEEDINGS 
I'M NEVER GOING TO GET USED TO THIS CHARLIE 
COME ON IT'S AS DIFFICULT FOR ME AS IT IS FOR YOU COME ON NO NO NO 
TOMORROW'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH DAY 
AND EVERYONE WILL NEED THEIR SLEEP 
WE'VE NEVER LEFT HIM ON HIS OWN 
YOU DON'T REALISE UNTIL YOU GET HERE AND THEN YOU PUT HIM IN THERE HOW HARD IT IS 
YES YOU SEE ALL THESE BLOKES COMING IN HERE CRYING AND ALL THAT 
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT BUT IT UPSETS ME YOU KNOW AS I SAID HE'S NEVER APART FROM US 
IF I GET A GOOD NIGHT'S KIP TONIGHT I'LL BE O. K. 
I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO IT FOR GEORGE'S SAKE 
PEOPLE SAY HOW COME YOU'RE THAT OLD AND NOT MARRIED 
HERE'S CHARLIE NOW YOU UNDERSTAND 
FOR CHARLIE GUNNER AND GEORGE THIS WEEK ISN'T GOING TO BE A HOLIDAY 
CHARLIE STANDS ACCUSED OF TERRORISING THE NEIGHBOURHOOD 
WITH HIS BLOODTHIRSTY WAYS 
WE NEED TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT DOG 
THE HARD THING IS GOING TO BE GETTING HER TO DO ANYTHING NEGATIVE TOWARDS THE DOG 
GUNNER IS CHARGED WITH THUGGISH BEHAVIOUR 
THAT REDUCES HIS OWNER'S WIFE TO TEARS 
THE MOMENT YOU START GOING WHO DID THAT 
YOU'RE JUST DRAWING LOADS OF ATTENTION TO IT 
AND GEORGE HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO BORSTAL FOR TEENAGE DELINQUENCY 
BUT WILL GEORGE AND OWNER EMMA PUSH MIC OVER THE EDGE 
THERE'S NO POINT IN ME PUTTING ALL THIS EFFORT INTO IT WHAT DO I CARE 
ITS THE FIRST DAY OF TRAINING 
THE DOGS HAVE ALL ENJOYED A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP 
GOOD MORNING PEOPLE 
RIFF RAFF MAN I'M KNACKERED MATE 
I'M SO TIRED I'M DIZZY 
I'M SO TIRED 
IT WAS SO COLD I KEPT GETTING CRAMP 
I COULDN'T GET WARM I COULDN'T GET COMFY 
I'VE HAD NO SLEEP 
SO I MAY HAVE A BREAKDOWN BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY SO BE WARNED 
EVERYONE'S KEEN TO CHECK IN ON THEIR DOG OH CHARLIE 
IT'S ALL RIGHT LITTLE PUPPY 
AND BEFORE TRAINING ALL DOGS NEED TAKING TO THE TOILET 
BUT FOR GEORGE IT'S COME TOO LATE 
THIS IS MINGING NOT IN THE MOOD NOT IN THE MOOD 
I'M TIRED I'VE HAD NO SLEEP GEORGE 
EMMA MIGHT BE FEELING TIRED BUT GEORGE IS FULL OF BEANS 
GEORGE FOR GOD'S SAKES 
DROP IT 
OVER AT H. Q. IT'S TIME FOR CHARLIE'S FIRST TRAINING SESSION 
BEFORE LYNNE STARTS SHE WANTS TO REVIEW HIS AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR 
HEATHER EXPLAINS THAT CHARLIE ISN'T ALL BAD 
CHARLIE HAS ONLY NIPPED TWO PEOPLE WHILE HE'S BEEN WITH ME EVER 
BUT HE HAS DRAWN BLOOD ON BOTH OF THOSE OCCASIONS 
I MEAN HE BIT ME THERE IS THE SCAR RIGHT 
AND I MEAN HE BIT ME HE DIDN'T NIP ME HE BIT ME 
IT'S THE SAME AS HUMAN BULLIES THEY USUALLY START OFF AS THE VICTIM 
YEAH AND INSTEAD OF BEING THE DOWNTRODDEN ONE 
THE ONE THAT GETS PICKED ON THEY GO THE OTHER WAY AND THEY BECOME THE BULLY 
I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY HOW CHARLIE'S ENDED UP 
LYNNE GOES WITH HEATHER TO COLLECT CHARLIE 
BUT HE ISN'T PLEASED TO SEE LYNNE 
CHARLIE 
IT'S TIME FOR CHARLIE TO FACE THE MUSIC 
COMING OUT 
AND EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES CALL FOR EXTREME MEASURES 
FROM THIS MOMENT ON WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUT A MUZZLE ON HIM FOR ANY REASON 
GOOD WE NEED TO GET HIM SO YOU CAN WALK HIM AND HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OF HIM 
FOR THAT WE ARE GOING TO USE A HEAD COLLAR 
ON THE WHOLE WHAT HEAD COLLARS DO IS THEY STEER THE DOG BY THE NOSE 
JUST LIKE REINS DO ON A HORSE 
IF YOU PULL THEM THAT WAY THEY GO THAT WAY 
SO THE HEAD'S THE BIT THAT BITES 
IF YOU'VE GOT TOTAL CONTROL OF HIS HEAD YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE 
LYNNE TAKES CHARLIE FOR A TEST DRIVE WITH THE NEW STEERING SYSTEM 
BUT CHARLIE DOESN'T LIKE BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO 
THIS IS JUST HIM GETTING USED TO THE COLLAR 
IF HE TRIES TO STRUGGLE OR WHATEVER I PUT A BIT OF PRESSURE ON AND LIFT HIS HEAD UP 
OH BLESS HIM THE MOMENT HE'S IN THE WRONG PLACE YOU JUST PUT A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE ON IT 
O. K. AND THEN WHEN HE'S SETTLED AGAIN YOU LET IT GO LOOSE AGAIN 
RIGHT O. K. AND ITS LITERALLY THAT AND THEN LOOSE 
O. K. THAT'S IT TWO FINGERS THAT'S ALL YOU NEED 
HOW DO I GET HIM FROM THERE TO SIT 
JUST PUT PRESSURE ON IT TELL HIM TO SIT JUST PUT PRESSURE CHARLIE SIT 
DON'T JERK IT JUST PULL HIM UP KEEP GOING KEEP GOING KEEP GOING 
COME ON SIT 
GO ON IT'S LIKE TORTURING HIM 
IT ISN'T LIKE TORTURING HIM OH 
SIT SIT RIGHT YOU KNOW THAT PANIC IN YOUR VOICE JUST THEN 
THEN HE KNOWS 
ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS GO FOR A STROLL I'LL TALK YOU THROUGH IT IF YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG 
NO GET DOWN CHARLIE 
RIGHT SO I'M JUST WALKING 
YES RIGHT COME ON CHARLIE 
TRY PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE ON IT EVERY TIME HE TRIES TO FORGE AHEAD OH MY GOODNESS ME 
THIS IS MARVELLOUS CHARLIE 
BLIMEY COME ON 
TURN ROUND CHARLIE 
YOU'VE NEVER WALKED LIKE THIS IN YOUR LIFE 
GOOD BOY 
OVER ON MIC'S TRAINING FIELD GEORGE HAS BEEN MISBEHAVING ALL MORNING 
HE'S CURRENTLY REFUSING TO LET GO OF THE LEAD NO 
IN THREE TWO ONE DROP IT GO 
TAKE IT IN STRAIGHT AWAY 
GIVE HIM A NO COMMAND 
NO NO 
DO A RIGHT TURN 
NO O. K. STOP 
STOP STOP IT'S ALL RIGHT 
NO IT'S ALL RIGHT LEAVE IT 
STOP 
YOU TEST MY PATIENCE GEORGE 
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE 
GEORGE IS BEING DISTRACTED BY RABBIT DROPPINGS WHICH HE SEES AS FOOD 
AS A LAST RESORT TO HELP EMMA CONTROL GEORGE 
MIC GOES IN SEARCH OF A TRAINING AID 
FOR EMMA IT'S A DISAPPOINTING START IT JUST GETS TO ME 
IT REALLY STRESSES ME OUT AND I HAVEN'T SLEPT ALL NIGHT 
I KNOW WE HAVEN'T BEEN TRAINING LONG BUT I JUST CAN'T EVEN DO ONE LITTLE THING 
WHAT'S THE MATTER 
I JUST DON'T THINK I CAN 
WHAT DO IT I CAN'T HANDLE IT YEAH COURSE YOU CAN 
YOU'VE GOT TO TRY TO TEACH THE NO SAME WAY AS YOU'RE DOING IT BUT WITH A SOUND ASSOCIATION 
SO THIS IS THE SOUND THE OLD RATTLE BOTTLE 
I'M GOING TO PUT MY HAND OUT LIKE THIS 
MIC HOLDS OUT SOME TREATS TO TEMPT GEORGE 
EMMA HAS TO STOP HIM EATING THEM 
NO 
THE SOUND OF THE RATTLE INTERRUPTS THE BAD BEHAVIOUR 
AND REINFORCES THE NO COMMAND 
NO 
MIC DECIDES TO SHOW EMMA HOW GEORGE CAN BEHAVE 
WHEN HANDLED THE RIGHT WAY 
JUST TURN YOUR BACK AND GO 
IT'S NOT ME I'M WALKING OVER THIS WAY 
NOW I'M WALKING OVER THIS WAY 
IF YOU WANT TO GO THE OTHER WAY YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE 
BUT I'M GOING THIS WAY NOW 
AND I'M GOING THIS WAY IT'S NOT 
I'M NOT YANKING HIM AROUND HE CAN DO WHAT HE LIKES 
BUT IF HE FOLLOWS ME IT'S A GOOD THING FOR HIM 
BUT THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE EMMA HAS THE SAME LEVEL OF CONTROL 
YOU CAN DO IT I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT 
BACK AT H. Q. 
IT'S GUNNER'S TURN TO BE PUT THROUGH HIS PACES WITH CANINE SHRINK ROBERT 
ONE THING THAT CONCERNS ME IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY HE BEHAVES WITH BOTH OF YOU 
CLINTON WE'RE GOING TO SEND YOU AWAY FOR A WHILE 
WE'LL LEAVE HIM FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES SO HE CAN GET USED TO DAD BEING GONE YEAH 
HE'S PEEING 
THAT'S BECAUSE CLINTON'S GONE 
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY HIS LITTLE SPITE THAT HE DOES 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S SPITE AT ALL 
THIS IS A BEHAVIOUR THAT YOU'VE TAUGHT HIM 
BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE THINGS LIKE GO OUT COME RUSHING BACK IN AND TELL HIM OFF 
FOR PEEING ON THE FLOOR WHAT YOU'VE TAUGHT HIM 
IS PEEING ON THE FLOOR IS A GOOD WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO COME BACK 
HE'S LOOKING TO SEE WHERE CLINTON IS 
YES YOU'VE TAUGHT HIM THIS 
SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO WHEN YOU'RE AT HOME 
IS JUST COME IN CLEAN IT UP DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT AT ALL 
THE MOMENT YOU START GOING WHO DID THAT 
YOU'RE JUST DRAWING LOADS OF ATTENTION TO IT YEAH 
AND IT JUST ENCOURAGES HIM TO DO IT AGAIN 
LISA'S BACK DOING HER DAILY WORKOUT 
ROBERT WANTS HER TO BE ABLE TO WALK GUNNER 
WITHOUT HER ARMS BEING PULLED OUT OF THEIR SOCKETS 
WHAT I WANT YOU TO WORK AT IS KEEPING HIS SHOULDER 
HIS RIGHT SHOULDER ROUGHLY LEVEL WITH YOUR LEFT KNEE 
IF HE'S THERE TO MY MIND HE CAN'T BE PULLING YOU 
HEEL WHENEVER HE PULLS YOU LIKE THAT HE GOES I'M OUT OF HERE 
I WANT YOU TO GO NO YOU'RE NOT IN THE SAME WAY 
HEEL GOOD BOY 
WHEN GUNNER GETS IT RIGHT HE IS REWARDED WITH A TASTY TREAT 
REINFORCING THE GOOD BEHAVIOUR 
GOOD BOY HEEL HE WAS BRINGING YOU INTO THE MIDDLE 
YOU'RE CONTROLLING THIS WALK 
COME ON FAST 
THIS IS LOOKING GOOD LISA 
GOOD BOY COME ON COME ON 
ROBERT DECIDES TO UP THE PACE 
AND STARTS TO INTRODUCE SOME DISTRACTIONS 
LEAVE LEAVE 
LEAVE 
LEAVE TELL HIM TO LEAVE IT 
LEAVE LEAVE GOOD BOY LEAVE 
HE PUSHED AWAY FROM IT THAT TIME 
HE SAID I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE NEAR IT MUM FANTASTIC 
GUNNER IS REWARDED FOR EVERY DISTRACTION HE WALKS STRAIGHT PAST 
LEAVE 
LEAVE 
THERE'S A GOOD BOY 
THERE'S A GOOD BOY 
WELL DONE GUNNER 
WELL DONE ME REALLY GOOD EXACTLY 
WELL DONE YOU TOO CLINTON DOESN'T WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS DOG UP THE PARK 
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BELIEVE YOU CAN CONTROL THIS DOG 
MY CONCERN IS YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SPENDS MOST OF THE DAY WITH HIM 
PART OF THIS EXERCISE IS TO SHOW YOU THAT YOU CAN CONTROL THIS DOG 
COME ON THEN GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY FASTER 
LISA'S FEELING PLEASED WITH HERSELF 
AND DECIDES TO CONTINUE PRACTISING AFTER THE SESSION HAS ENDED 
ALL CLINTON CAN DO IS FOLLOW ALONG BEHIND SLOW 
LUNCHTIME BRINGS A WELCOME BREAK FROM TRAINING 
I WAS IN FLOODS OF TEARS THIS MORNING WHAT YOU GOT TOLD OFF 
NO I JUST GOT EMOTIONAL 
HE WEREN'T DOING WHAT I WANTED HIM TO DO AND I JUST SAT THERE FRUSTRATED AND I WAS TIRED 
AFTER LUNCH MIC PRESSES ON WITH GEORGE'S TRAINING 
INTRODUCING MORE COMMANDS 
HEEL SAY THE WORD THEN STEP OFF 
KEEP GOING 
EMMA'S GETTING HER TIMING WRONG SHE'S SAYING HEEL AFTER SHE'S STEPPED OFF 
ALWAYS REMEMBER COMMAND ACTION PRAISE CAP COMMAND ACTION PRAISE 
O. K. YOU'RE GONNA DO AN ABOUT TURN GET READY ABOUT TURN 
HEEL 
HALTING IN THE STAND 
HALT 
SIT 
O. K. STOP 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT PICTURE HALTING IN THE STAND 
HE'S SITTING AND SHOULD BE STANDING LET'S DO IT AGAIN 
EMMA'S JUST NOT CONCENTRATING 
SO HALTING IN THE STAND I COVER HIS EYES YEAH 
I'VE GOT IT I'VE GOT IT LET'S START AGAIN NORMAL PACE FORWARD 
MIC IS STARTING TO LOSE HIS PATIENCE 
HALTING IN THE STAND HALT 
WAIT 
HAPPY YES SMILE THEN FOR SAKE YOU MISERABLE LOOKING COW 
I AM GO ON THEN RUN OFF DOWN THAT ROAD GO GO RUN RUN TRUST ME 
MIC WANTS TO FIND OUT IF GEORGE WILL COME TO EMMA WHEN CALLED 
CALL HIM NOW COME ON GEORGE COME ON GEORGE 
AGAIN KEEP GOING 
BUT GEORGE FINDS RABBIT DROPPINGS 
MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN OWNER EMMA 
GOOD BOY OFF YOU GO 
COME ON GEORGE 
GEORGE 
COME ON GEORGE GOOD BOY COME ON 
MIC'S HAD ENOUGH FOR THE DAY AND TELLS EMMA TO PUT GEORGE AWAY 
DOG IN 
HE'S TELLING ME TO GO LEFT AND I'M GOING RIGHT 
AND HE'S TELLING ME TO GET THE DOG TO SIT AND I'M GETTING THE DOG TO LAY DOWN 
I DON'T THINK MIC'S VERY HAPPY WITH ME AND GEORGE 
I WANT A HUG KEEP SMILING DON'T WORRY 
YOU POOR POOR GIRL 
I'VE WORKED SO HARD 
DON'T LET IT GET YOU DOWN THOUGH IF YOU'VE MADE AN IMPROVEMENT THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS 
IT'S TIME TO WIND DOWN AFTER A LONG DAY 
BUT MIC STILL HAS GEORGE AND EMMA ON HIS MIND 
MY ONLY FRUSTRATION IS HER TIMING 
AND YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAID EARLIER HER ACTUAL ABILITY IT'S AWFUL ISN'T IT 
I DON'T THINK SHE'LL WIN AN OBEDIENCE COMPETITION 
BUT SHE'LL BE ABLE TO WALK DOWN A STREET 
THAT'S ALL SHE WANTS INNIT EXACTLY 
LYNNE THINKS HEATHER'S PROBLEMS GO EVEN DEEPER 
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PERSONAL STUFF GOING ON AND I THINK SHE IS NOW RELIANT ON CHARLIE 
AS AN EMOTIONAL CRUTCH 
AND ROBERT'S QUIETLY CONFIDENT 
GUNNER'S DOING WELL AND SO ARE HIS OWNERS 
I HAD A REALLY GOOD DAY TODAY 
WHEN I FIRST CAME TO DOG BORSTAL 
I DIDN'T HAVE NO CONFIDENCE WITH GUNNER AT ALL 
AND EVERY DAY MY CONFIDENCE IS GETTING STRONGER AND STRONGER 
AND THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE DOG IS GETTING STRONGER WHICH IS GOOD THAT'S WHY I'M HERE 
IT'S FINE LIKE I'M NOT JEALOUS LIKE THAT OR NOTHING 
AS LONG AS HE KNOWS I MEAN THE DOG HAS ONE MASTER 
WHAT SORT OF MEAT WOULD YOU LIKE ON THE BARBECUE FIRST OVER TO EMMA 
A BIT OF MIC'S EGO MAYBE 
SO WHAT YOU TRYING TO SAY ACTUALLY EMMA 
SERVED UP WITH A NICE SIDE SALAD OF SARCASM 
I'VE BEEN TOTALLY RAGGED TODAY BY MIC 
HE'S BEEN REALLY MEAN AND HE CALLED ME A SOUR 
WHAT WAS IT 
A MISERABLE SOUR FACED COW 
I'VE BEEN QUITE A NAUGHTY GIRL 
AND I'VE NOT DONE MY REVISION THAT HE'S SET OUT FOR ME 
AND I'M NOT WEARING BLACK TOMORROW 
SO HE'LL HAVE TWO REASONS TO HAVE A GO AT ME WON'T HE 
BAD DOGS CHARLIE GUNNER AND GEORGE ARE SERVING TIME AT BORSTAL 
IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY MUST SIT A TEST TO PROVE THEY ARE REFORMED 
GOOD BOY 
I'M SO NERVOUS THERE'S NO WAY 
BUT WILL ANY OF THEM PASS 
EVERYONE'S WAKING UP AFTER ANOTHER HARD NIGHT IN BORSTAL 
I HATE CAMPING AND I REALLY HATE THE RAIN 
I HOPE IT STOPS I DON'T NEED THIS ALL DAY MATE HELL 
THERE'S JUST TIME FOR A MISERABLE MORNING WALK IN THE RAIN 
FOLLOWED BY A DAMP BREAKFAST 
BEFORE STARTING THE DAY'S TRAINING 
MIC'S WORRIED GEORGE MAY BE THE WRONG DOG FOR EMMA 
GET YOURSELF SOMETHING SMALL LEARN YOUR TRADE AND THEN STEP UP 
YOU JUST PASSED YOUR DRIVING TEST DON'T BUY A SPORTS CAR 
GET YOURSELF A LITTLE FAMILY SALOON AND THEN BUILD YOURSELF UP 
IF IT'S YOUR FIRST DOG AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING DON'T GET A BLOODY RANGE ROVER 
DON'T GET A FERRARI COS THEY'RE JUST GONNA GET SO BORED 
OVER ON THE TRAINING FIELD EMMA IS SLOWLY GETTING THE HANG OF THINGS 
HEEL GOOD BOY 
LEAVE 
TURN HIM RIGHT RIGHT TURN HEEL 
HALTING IN THE STAND WAIT 
NORMAL PACE FORWARD 
HEEL RIGHT TURN 
HEEL 
HALTING IN THE DOWN DOWN 
MIC IS MORE UPBEAT ABOUT GEORGE'S PROGRESS 
ONCE YOU GET HIM DOWN MAKE SURE HE STAYS DOWN 
I WENT THE RIGHT WAY THIS TIME 
NOT BAD MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT FROM YESTERDAY WEREN'T IT 
BIG IMPROVEMENT I'M WELL PLEASED WITH HIM 
JUST KEEP HIM IN THE DOWN DON'T LET HIM MOVE YOU 
BUT IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE GEORGE IS UP TO HIS OLD TRICKS 
HE JUST WANTS TO EAT ALL THE RABBIT STUFF 
IT'S TIME TO USE THE RATTLE BOTTLE 
EXCEPT EMMA'S FORGOTTEN TO BRING IT 
JUST SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I GET PISSED OFF WITH THIS SORT OF THING HE'S ACTUALLY MISBEHAVING NOW YEAH 
AND SO BY THE TIME WE COME BACK WE'VE GOT TO START OVER AGAIN THIS IS NOT FAIR FOR THE DOG NO 
TOLD OFF 
GEORGE MUMMY'S BAD 
WE'VE GOT FIVE HUNDRED OF THESE 
AND ALL SHE NEEDS TO DO IS CARRY ONE OF THEM AND WE'D BE ALL RIGHT 
SHE'S THE SORT OF GIRL WHO I MEAN LIKE I'M SORRY I'M SORRY 
DON'T BE SORRY TO ME IT'S DOG 
HE GIVES ME SO MUCH CRAP DON'T HE I CAN'T REMEMBER IT ALL 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'VE LEFT IT I THINK I'VE LEFT IT 
I THINK I'VE LEFT IT AT CAMP 
I DON'T KNOW UNLESS IT'S 
OR IT'S I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS NOW 
LET'S START ALL OVER AGAIN SORRY WILL YOU MAKE ME DO PRESS UPS 
NO YOU AIN'T GOT TO DO ANYTHING YOU DON'T WANNA DO SAME AS ME 
TAKE THAT 
I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED I KNOW I AM TOO 
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE IT STARTS TO RAIN AGAIN 
IF THE RAIN KEEPS UP LIKE THIS WE'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF TIME BEFORE WE'VE GOT TO DO A TEST YEAH 
SO YOU GOTTA SAY TO YOURSELF I'VE GOTTA PULL MY FINGER OUT 
WITH RAIN BUCKETING DOWN MIC DECIDES TO USE THE TIME TO GO THROUGH EMMA'S HOMEWORK 
HAVE YOU DONE YOUR DIARY 
HUH HAVE YOU DONE YOUR DIARY 
NO NOT AT ALL NO 
O. K. I DIDN'T DO THAT 
ALL RIGHT SO PUT YOUR DOG AWAY PLEASE 
O. K. AND MAKE SURE HE'S DRY TAKE ALL YOUR KIT WITH YOU SEE YOU IN A BIT 
SEE YOU LATER COME ON THEN BOY 
YOU DONE THE DIARY NAH 
WHAT THE THE POINT THEN 
WHAT'S THE POINT IN ME PUTTING ALL THIS EFFORT INTO IT WHAT DO I CARE 
YOU WANNA DO YOUR BEST BUT AS SOON AS YOU HEAR OH I AIN'T DONE IT 
I FORGOT MY BALL I FORGOT MY BAG 
IT I FORGOT TO TURN UP 
CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF BORSTAL TRAINER ROBERT IS ON A HIGH 
SEE HOW HE JUST PAYS ATTENTION NOW 
AND SHE'S SO MUCH MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT THE WAY SHE HANDLES HIM 
IT'S JUST REALLY GOOD TO SEE 
HE'S ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO HER 
SHE'S MORE ABLE TO TRAIN THIS DOG THAN SHE REALISES 
I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS DOG OUT FOR WALKS 
TO LET HIM OFF THE LEAD SO WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE REST OF THE DAY WITH HIM 
HE'S CALMER HE'LL BE MORE CALM THAN WHAT HE IS AT THE MOMENT 
OH 
HOW'S YOUR DAY BEEN GEEZER 
HELL I'M WELL PISSED OFF 
WHAT'S HAPPENED I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST HER TIMING IS ATROCIOUS 
IT'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER 
ROBERT OFFERS MIC A LIFELINE THAT JUST MIGHT CHEER HIM UP 
O. K. WE'LL SWAP THIS AFTERNOON 
ROBERT WILL TAKE GEORGE'S NEXT TRAINING SESSION 
ALL I'M GONNA DO IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO MIC'S 
IT DOESN'T MEAN MINE'S RIGHT ANY MORE THAN HIS 
BUT IT MIGHT MAKE IT A EASIER FOR YOU TO GET USED TO HOW TO USE YOUR TIMING CORRECTLY 
AND INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF SUCCESS LEAVE 
LOOK SOME LOVELY SWEETIES 
INSIDE UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS 
ROBERT GETS EMMA TO PRACTISE THE TIMING OF HER LEAVE COMMAND LEAVE 
JUST DON'T STOP TO WAIT FOR HIM YOU DRAG HIM 
WHAT HE THINKS IS IF HE LIES DOWN IT GIVES HIM MORE TIME TO CONTINUE TO MISBEHAVE LEAVE 
LEAVE NOSE GOES ON THE FLOOR AGAIN AFTER YOU'VE TOLD HIM TO GET HIS NOSE OFF THE FLOOR 
DROP THE BOTTLE RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM O. K. 
LEAVE 
GOOD PICK IT UP AGAIN 
NOW REALISES THAT IF HE DOESN'T LIFT HIS NOSE 
THE BOTTLE MIGHT COME CRASHING TO THE GROUND 
GEORGE IS FINALLY BEGINNING TO LISTEN TO EMMA 
HE'S SHOWING NO INTEREST IN WHAT'S ON THE FLOOR 
IF YOU WERE MARKING YOURSELF OUT OF TEN WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE YOURSELF 
SEVEN 
I'D GIVE YOU TEN FOR BOTH OF THEM REALLY 
SPOT ON ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON 
MEANWHILE AS PART OF A SWAP 
MIC HAS AGREED TO TAKE GUNNER AROUND THE AGILITY COURSE WITH HIS OWNER CLINTON 
REMEMBER THE GOOD HUP COMMAND JUST BEFORE YOU GET THERE 
HUP GOOD BOY GUNNER 
AS YOU GO TO THESE BIGGER JUMPS 
YOU'VE GOT TO HOLD THE LEFT AND AS YOU GET NEAR IT AND YOU GO HUP 
YOU'VE GOT TO LET GO OF THE LEFT 
HUP GOOD BOY 
GUNNER HAS LOTS OF EXCESS ENERGY 
AND CLINTON NEEDS TO FIND WAYS TO BURN IT OFF GOOD BOY HUP 
HUP 
AH YOU PLONKER 
HUP 
HUP GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
BEAUTIFUL NICE ONE MATE BRILLIANT 
DOG OUT 
AS FOR CHARLIE IT'S TIME TO FINALLY CONFRONT HIS DEMONS 
JUST THREE DAYS AGO NO ONE WAS SAFE WHEN CHARLIE LEFT THE HOUSE 
NO 
ALTHOUGH THE NEW HARNESS ALLOWS HEATHER TO CONTROL HIM 
CHARLIE'S VICIOUS STREAK HASN'T DISAPPEARED 
IT'S ALL A MATTER OF DIVERTING HIS ATTENTION 
LYNNE HAS A PLAN TO DO JUST THAT WHAT'S THIS WHAT'S THIS 
FETCH USING A WALLET STUFFED WITH TREATS 
HEATHER CAN SHIFT CHARLIE'S ATTENTION OFF PEOPLE 
AND ONTO SOMETHING MORE REWARDING 
ONCE CHARLIE'S GOT THE HANG OF RETRIEVING THE WALLET 
IT'S TIME TO BRING IN SOME HUMAN FLESH 
CHARLIE FETCH IT COME ON 
CHARLIE COME ON FETCH 
FETCH GOOD BOY CALL HIM BACK 
RUN BACKWARDS MOVE BACKWARDS 
CHARLIE CHARLIE 
COME ON COME HERE GOOD BOY 
HE DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE THAT THEY WERE ALL THERE NOT AT ALL INTERESTED 
WE'VE GOT HIM OFF LEAD 
DOING SOMETHING ELSE AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO EAT PEOPLE 
PEOPLE HE DOESN'T KNOW PEOPLE HE HASN'T MET PEOPLE MOVING AROUND 
HEATHER NEVER THOUGHT SHE'D SEE THE DAY 
DOG IN 
I FEEL REALLY PROUD 
EMOTIONAL MOMENT 
BLIMEY I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT 
TO LET CHARLIE OFF THE LEAD IN THE COMPANY OF TOTAL STRANGERS 
MEANS I CAN HAVE DINNER PARTIES AGAIN A FEW COCKTAILS 
THAT WE'VE HAD TO CANCEL FOR A WHILE 
TOMORROW IS TEST DAY 
MIC NEEDS TO BUILD BRIDGES WITH EMMA AND BOLSTER HER CONFIDENCE 
HELLO MATE HELLO HOW ARE YOU DOING 
SHE'S EVEN DOING HER HOMEWORK 
I HIT THE BOOKS GOOD BOY AS THEY SAY 
KENNEL DAVE HAD A CHAT WITH ME AND SAYS THAT WHEN YOU GO IN THE KENNEL THE DOG JUMPS UP AT YOU 
YEAH HE DOES SO THE PLAN IS WHY AREN'T YOU USING THE BOTTLE TO STOP HIM I SHOULD BE SHOULDN'T I 
YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO ASSOCIATE WHAT YOU DO OUT IN THE FIELD WITH WHAT YOU DO IN THE REAL WORLD YEAH 
ALSO HE'S HAD A BIG HAS HE 
I THINK POOR MIC NEEDS A BREAK FROM GEORGE AND I HAVE THAT EVERY DAY 
AFTER AN EXHAUSTING DAY'S TRAINING IT'S TIME TO WALK THE INMATES 
JUST USE THE NO COMMAND OR THE LEAVE 
MIC REWARDS CLINTON WITH SOME OF HIS OWN BEER 
AND TESTS EMMA ON HER HOMEWORK 
EMMA HOW MANY TEETH 
FORTY TWO 
GOOD BOY HOW MANY BONES 
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR 
GOOD BOY 
IT'S TEST DAY TOMORROW AND I'M FEELING REALLY NERVOUS 
I'M APPREHENSIVE I'M SCARED BUT I AM KIND OF LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
BUT I THINK WE CAN DO IT SO WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT 
I HAD A LUMP IN MY THROAT HE MADE MEPROUD TODAY 
HE WAS EXCELLENT TODAY ROB SEEMS TO THINK WE'VE GOT A GREAT CHANCE 
GREAT CHANCE YEAH 
I'D BE UPSET AND PISSED OFF 
WE WANT A RED ROSETTE YEAH WE WANT THE TOP 
I ACTUALLY SAID TO LYNNE IT WASN'T PROGRESS IT WAS A MIRACLE 
I'D NEVER EXPECTED THAT TO HAPPEN 
BUT WILL CHARLIE PERFORM WHEN IT COUNTS AND PASS TOMORROW'S TEST 
IT'S JUDGEMENT DAY 
I REALLY JUST WANT TO GET IN THERE AND DO IT NOW 
THE OWNERS JUST HAVE TIME TO GIVE THEIR DOGS ONE LAST WALK 
IN UNDER AN HOUR THEY FACE THE FINAL TEST 
FROM THIS POINT ON THE TRAINERS ARE POWERLESS TO INTERVENE 
WILL THEIR DOGS BE AWARDED THE RED ROSETTE OF DISTINCTION 
SCRAPE A YELLOW PASS OR BE SENT HOME WITH THEIR TAILS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS 
FIRST UP WILL BE GUNNER 
HIS OWNERS ARE PUTTING HIM THROUGH HIS FINAL PACES 
BUT CLINTON'S MADE THE MISTAKE OF GETTING OUT GUNNER'S FAVOURITE TOY 
GOOD BOY GUN 
GUNNER REALLY LOVES HIS RUBBER BALL WHICH THEY HAVEN'T USED ALL WEEK 
BUT THEY BROUGHT IT OUT THIS MORNING TO HAVE A BIT OF A PLAY 
AND HE'S BECOME SO OBSESSED WITH THE BALL NOW 
THAT EVERYTHING ELSE WENT TO POT AND ALL HE WANTS IS HIS BALL 
HE'S PEED OFF NOW BECAUSE I GOT THE BALL OUT THE BLOODY BALL OUT 
IT JUST REALLY DISRUPTED HIM 
IT TOOK HIS ATTENTION OFF COMPLETELY WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH HIM 
LEAVE LEAVE 
NOW SHE'S GETTING THE HUMP NOW AND ALL 
P. M. T. MATE P. M. T. 
THE TEST WILL BE JUDGED BY PAT WHITE 
SHE'S LECTURED ON DOG TRAINING ALL OVER THE WORLD 
AND THE FATE OF EACH DOG WILL REST OR FALL ON HER FINAL DECISION 
BACK AT HOME GUNNER RAN RINGS AROUND LISA 
I'M NOT PLAYING WITH YOU 
AND ON THE STREET WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO WALK 
SO THE FIRST STAGE OF GUNNER'S TEST WILL BE WALKING TO HEEL 
GOD I'M SO NERVOUS 
ROBERT CAN ONLY WATCH AND PRAY 
HEEL 
SO THE FAST PACE IS LOOKING O. K. 
SLOW IT DOWN SLOW IT DOWN LISA 
BUT WHAT PAT WILL BE LOOKING FOR IS LISA'S ABILITY TO CONTROL HIS BEHAVIOUR 
JUST STOP THERE AND PUT HIM IN A SIT SIT 
GOOD BOY 
O. K. OFF YOU GO AGAIN 
BUT GUNNER DECIDES TO EMPTY HIS BLADDER INSTEAD 
LET HIM HAVE A PEE THAT'S FINE 
IF THIS WAS A COMPETITION SHE'D BE DISQUALIFIED 
HOPEFULLY PAT ISN'T JUDGING IT LIKE A COMPETITION 
GET HIS ATTENTION AGAIN COME ON 
GOOD BOY LET'S SEE YOU MOVE A BIT FASTER 
GOOD GIRL HEEL 
HEEL O. K. BACK INTO NORMAL 
OH NORMAL JUST NORMAL PACE 
FINE GOOD GIRL 
AND BACK INTO A SIT SIT 
GOOD BOY LET'S GET THE VOICE PRAISE UP AND HANDS OFF 
YOU DID THAT REALLY WELL WELL DONE 
IT'S TIME FOR GUNNER'S BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
OFF THE LEAD HE MUST COME BACK TO LISA WHEN CALLED 
SOMETHING CLINTON HAS NEVER ALLOWED 
GUNNER COME ON COME ON COME ON 
THERE'S A GOOD BOY 
STOP STOP SIT SIT 
WELL DONE I'M HAPPY WITH THAT 
I THINK SHE'S GOT A GOOD CHANCE OF HER HALF OF THE TEST 
NOW IT'S ALL DOWN TO CLINTON 
STAY HELLO CLINTON HELLO DARLING ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
THIS IS NOT THE GRAND NATIONAL 
I DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS DONE AT SPEED BECAUSE SPEED IS WHEN DISASTERS HAPPEN 
RIGHT 
THE LAST PART OF GUNNER'S TEST IS ON MIC'S AGILITY COURSE 
GUNNER MUST NOW PROVE HIMSELF WITH CLINTON AT THE CONTROLS HUP HUP 
HE'S REFUSED HE'S REFUSED THE DOG WALK 
GOOD BOY HUP GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY COME ON THEN HUP 
GOOD BOY HUP GOOD BOY

HAS CLINTON DONE ENOUGH TO SECURE A RED ROSETTE 
WELL DONE THANKS A LOT PRIDE OF PLACE ON THE WALL 
SIXTY FIVE OUT OF EIGHTY 
DO NOT PUT THAT ON HIS COLLAR OH IT'S YELLOW CONGRATULATIONS 
THANK YOU WELL DONE 
THEY'VE GRADUATED BUT SADLY NOT WITH DISTINCTION 
FOUR DAYS AGO THEY COULDN'T EVEN HOLD HIM SHE COULDN'T WALK HIM 
SO THEY'VE COME SUCH A LONG WAY 
BUT I KNOW THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED 
NEXT UP TO MEET THE JUDGE IS CHARLIE AND HIS OWNER HEATHER 
THEY'RE EN ROUTE TO IPSWICH WHERE A BUSY TOWN CENTRE AWAITS THEM 
BACK HOME CHARLIE WAS MAD BAD AND DANGEROUS TO KNOW 
TWO LEGS FOUR LEGS HE'D ATTACK ANYTHING 
FOR THE TEST 
HEATHER MUST WALK CHARLIE THROUGH A CROWDED CITY CENTRE ON MARKET DAY 
OFF YOU GO HEATHER 
HEEL CHARLIE THE JUDGE COMMUNICATES WITH HEATHER THROUGH AN EARPIECE 
HEATHER WALK AS FAST AS YOU WANT TO WALK LYNNE CAN ONLY FOLLOW BEHIND 
THE JUDGE IS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SIGNS OF GROWLING OR BARKING 
AND ANY ATTEMPTS BY CHARLIE TO JUMP AT PEOPLE 
WHAT A GOOD LITTLE PUP I'VE GOT 
YOU'RE DOING REALLY WELL DEBBIE 
I WISH SHE WOULD SHUT UP 
HEATHER'S BEGINNING TO FEEL THE STRAIN 
I DIDN'T SEE HUGE AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE RUNNING IN ALL DIRECTIONS 
SO I DIDN'T HEAR THE DOG GROWLING OR JUMPING AT PEOPLE 
I'D GIVE HER DISTINCTION EASILY ON WHAT SHE'S DONE TODAY 
HOW DID YOU THINK THAT WENT 
IN TERMS OF ME CONTROLLING THE DOG IT WENT EXTREMELY WELL HOW DID YOU THINK IT WENT FOR HIM 
I THINK HE'S VERY STRESSED IT'S A LOT TO PUT HIM THROUGH IT IS A LOT 
AND FOR ME PERSONALLY TOO MUCH 
O. K. BUT HE'S DONE REALLY WELL YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY PLEASED WITH HIM 
YOU'RE FEELING YOUR CRITICAL DISTANCE NOW I'M FUMING O. K. 
ALL RIGHT WELL DON'T FUME AT ME 
DON'T KILL THE JUDGE 
BACK AT BORSTAL THE JUDGE DELIVERS HER VERDICT 
WELL DONE YOU AND WELL DONE CHARLIE THERE YOU GO 
HE'S A CRACKER ABSOLUTE CRACKER 
BUT IT'S NOT THE DISTINCTION LYNNE PREDICTED 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DISTINCTION BUT HEATHER A LITTLE BIT 
HER UPTIGHTNESS IS RUNNING RIGHT DOWN TO THE DOG NOW 
AND SHE IS DETERMINED THAT HE WAS SO STRESSED 
THE FACT WAS THAT SHE WAS ACTUALLY SO STRESSED 
LAST UP IS GEORGE 
HIS OWNER EMMA IS NERVOUSLY WAITING FOR THE TEST TO BEGIN 
MIC KNOWS THEY'RE FACING A TOUGH JUDGE 
AND WANTS TO CHECK EMMA HASN'T FORGOTTEN ANYTHING
