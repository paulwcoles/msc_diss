HELLO AND WELCOME TO POSTCARDS FROM KENYA 
I SHALL SHOW YOU KENYA THE COUNTRY THAT MY FAMILY AND I COME FROM 
KENYA'S A LAND OF MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND PLACES 
IN THIS PROGRAMME WE WILL LOOK AT KENYA AND ITS VARIOUS LANDSCAPES 
WE WILL STUDY ITS LOCATION AND FIND OUT WHAT IT'S LIKE 
BUT FIRST WHERE IS KENYA 
HERE IT IS 
KENYA'S A COUNTRY OF CENTRAL EAST AFRICA 
AFRICA IS THE CONTINENT 
JUST LOOK AT HOW BIG IT IS 
KENYA'S ONE OF THE MANY COUNTRIES ON THIS CONTINENT 
KENYA COVERS MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND SQUARE KILOMETRES OF LAND 
MORE THAN TWICE THE SIZE OF BRITAIN 
TO GET FROM BRITAIN TO KENYA 
WE'D HAVE TO FLY ALL THE WAY ACROSS EUROPE 
AND THE COUNTRIES OF NORTH AFRICA 
THIS TAKES AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS 
KENYA SITS ON THE EQUATOR SO IT'S VERY HOT 
OUR NEIGHBOURS ARE ETHIOPIA SUDAN 
UGANDA TANZANIA AND SOMALIA 
TO THE SOUTHEAST THE COAST IS WASHED BY THE INDIAN OCEAN 
KENYA'S A VAST COUNTRY AND HAS MANY DIFFERENT LANDSCAPES 
LET'S FIND OUT ABOUT SOME OF THEM 
WE'VE GOT MOUNTAINS AND DEEP VALLEYS 
BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS IS AN AMAZING AREA CALLED THE RIFT VALLEY 
THIS IS A DEEP VALLEY WITH MOUNTAINS ON BOTH SIDES 
IT'S MORE THAN FOUR ZERO ZERO ZERO K. M. IN LENGTH 
AND RUNS FROM NORTH TO SOUTH 
OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS KENYA'S HAD MANY EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANOES 
SOME OF THESE VOLCANOES CAN BE SEEN TODAY 
LAKE NAIVASHA NEAR THE RIFT VALLEY 
WAS FORMED AS A RESULT OF A VOLCANIC ERUPTION 
THE AREA AROUND IT 
IS THOUGHT TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES INHABITED BY PEOPLE 
HUMAN SKELETONS THAT ARE MORE THAN TWO MILLION YEARS OLD 
HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE REGION 
ANOTHER ANCIENT AND NOW EXTINCT VOLCANO 
THAT LIES IMMEDIATELY SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR IS MOUNT KENYA 
MOUNT KENYA KENYA'S HIGHEST MOUNTAIN 
STANDS FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY NINE METRES TALL 
AT THE TOP OF THE SUMMIT AREA 
YOU WILL FIND STEEP PEAKS THAT LOOK LIKE PYRAMIDS 
EVEN THOUGH MOUNT KENYA LIES ON THE EQUATOR 
THESE PEAKS ARE COVERED WITH SNOW 
MUCH OF KENYA IS HIGH ABOVE SEA LEVEL SO THE AIR IS THIN 
THIS THIN AIR ENABLES ATHLETES TO PERFORM BETTER 
KENYAN ATHLETES BEING BORN AND TRAINED AT ALTITUDE 
ARE AMONGST THE BEST IN THE WORLD 
ONE HUNDRED TO GO SAMMY KIPKETER ARMS GOING KNEES GOING 
THAT SMILE THAT GRIMACE BEN LIMO ALONGSIDE HIM 
IT'S A REAL BATTLE FOR THE LINE KIPKETER AND LIMO 
KIPKETER'S GOING TO WIN IT YES 
IN THE HIGHLANDS OF KENYA 
WHERE THE WEATHER IS COOLER COFFEE BEANS ARE GROWN 
COFFEE EARNS THE COUNTRY LOTS OF MONEY SO IT'S CALLED A CASH CROP 
MORE THAN HALF OF THE COFFEE GROWN IS EXPORTED 
KENYA ALSO HAS LARGE FARM AND NATURAL GRASSLAND AREAS 
AS WELL AS BEAUTIFUL BEACHES 
THERE ARE ALSO VILLAGES SCATTERED IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
AND LARGE TOWNS AND CITIES 
KENYA HAS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF LANDSCAPES 
IT'S GOT MOUNTAINS RIVERS LAKES DESERTS 
GREEN FIELDS VOLCANOES AND CITIES 
LET'S MEET SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN KENYA 
KENYA IS A LAND OF MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
BETWEEN THEM THEY SPEAK MORE THAN SEVENTY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES 
ALTHOUGH THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES OF KENYA ARE SWAHILI AND ENGLISH 
AS IN BRITAIN PEOPLE LIVE IN TOWNS AS WELL AS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
THIS IS EVANGELINE SHE LIVES IN THE COUNTRY WITH HER FAMILY 
THIS IS OUR HOUSE 
THIS IS THE CORRIDOR 
THIS IS THE SITTING ROOM 
ANOTHER CORRIDOR 
THIS IS MY ROOM 
THIS IS OUR WASHING ROOM 
THIS IS OUR KITCHEN 
THIS IS THE POULTRY HOUSE 
AND THIS IS THE 
AND THIS IS THE STORE 
NOW LET'S GO TO A CITY 
THIS IS THE CAPITAL IT'S CALLED NAIROBI 
NANA AND HER FAMILY LIVE HERE 
IN A LARGE HOUSE ON THE OUTSKIRTS 
HELLO MY NAME IS NANA I LIVE IN NAIROBI THE CAPITAL CITY OF KENYA 
I LIVE IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA 
OUR HOUSE IS SURROUNDED WITH A HIGH HEDGE 
I LIVE HERE WITH MY MUM MY DAD AND MY TWO BROTHERS 
BUT NOT EVERYBODY LIVES LIKE NANA AND HER FAMILY 
IN THE CITIES PEOPLE LIVE IN SMALL HOUSES AND IN LARGE HOUSES 
THE POOREST PEOPLE IN THE CITY LIVE IN SHANTY TOWNS 
SO THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF HOUSES IN KENYA 
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE AND HOW YOU MAKE YOUR LIVING 
PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE LIVED IN KENYA FOR GENERATIONS 
IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES WHEN MUCH OF ASIA AND AFRICA 
WAS RULED BY THE BRITISH EMPIRE 
THOUSANDS OF INDIANS ARRIVED HERE AS SERVANTS UNDER THE BRITISH 
THEY BUILT WHAT BECAME KNOWN AS THE BRITISH EAST AFRICAN RAILROAD 
AFTER THE BRITISH LEFT KENYA 
MANY OF THE ASIANS CONTINUED LIVING 
THEY FARMED VEGETABLES AND WENT INTO BUSINESS 
TODAY THE ASIAN PEOPLE MAKE UP ABOUT ONE PER CENT OF THE POPULATION 
AND MAINLY LIVE IN THE CITIES THEY HAVE INFLUENCED THE WAY OF LIFE 
SO JUST AS IN BRITAIN 
YOU FIND DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THE SAME COUNTRY 
IN THIS CITY MARKET THERE ARE LOTS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
ORIGINALLY IMPORTED BY KENYA'S ASIAN COMMUNITY 
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW FOOD AND CULTURE MIGRATED ROUND THE WORLD 
IS THERE A STREET OR MARKET NEAR YOU THAT ILLUSTRATES THIS 
SO KENYA IS A LARGE COUNTRY 
WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF LANDSCAPES HOUSES AND PEOPLE 
I HOPED YOU ENJOYED VISITING IT GOODBYE
