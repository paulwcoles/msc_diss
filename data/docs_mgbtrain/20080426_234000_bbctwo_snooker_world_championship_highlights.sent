A A IT IS DAY A HERE AT THE WERE 
SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIP DAY EIGHT 
TONIGHT WE WILL BE FEATURING THE 
MATCH BETWEEN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AND 
MARK WILLIAMS 
THE WELSHMAN HAS 
BEEN SLIDING DOWN THE RANKINGS OF 
LATE BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE FOUND 
HIS FORM AGAIN AND LOOKED 
IMPRESSIVE IN THE FIRST ROUND 
JIMMY WHITE WAS MY HERO GROWING UP 
BECAUSE HE WAS LEFT HANDED AND 
EXCITING TO WATCH EVERYTHING ABOUT 
HIM REALLY THE FIRST MAJOR WAS IN 
NEWPORT I BEAT JOHN PARROTT IN THE 
FINAL I DID NOT CELEBRATE HAVE 
NEVER CELEBRATED ANYMORE OF MY 
VICTORIES ANY OF MILE VICTORIES 
IT IS THE SAME AS THE WEEK AFTER AN 
THE WEEK BEFORE L. 
WOULD SAY I WOULD RETIRE PROBABLY THE WAY I 
AM GOING IN THE RANKINGS L. HAVE 
NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT 
SUPPOSE IF YOU THINK YOU CANNOT 
COMPETE AND WIN TOURNAMENTS IT IS 
TIME TO PACK IT IN L. L. HAVE FEW 
YEARS LEFT 
WELL RONNIE O'SULLIVAN MADE HIS 
DEBUT AT THE CRUCIBLE IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE IN 
NINETEEN NINETY SIX HE REACHED THE SEMI FINALS 
IN TWO THOUSAND ONE HE WAS THE WINNER AGAINST 
JOHN HIGGINS IN TO AND HIGGINS 
THE FIRST FOUR FRAMES WERE SHARED 
THIS EVENING WE WILL PICK IT UP IN 
FRAME FIVE THERE IS NO SCORE THE 
COMMENTARY COMES FROM DENNIS TAYLOR 
AND JOHN VIRGO AT LEAST FIVE REDS ARE AVAILABLE 
HE MAY HAVE FINISHED A LITTLE 
STRAIGHT ON THIS HE SHOULD BE O. K. 
THERE LOOK AT THE BOUNCE OFF THE 
CUSHION THERE HE DID NOT GET ON 
THE RED AS HE INTENDED AND THAT 
WHITE HAS JUST FLOWN OFF THAT SIDE 
CUSHION THE WHITE BALL NOW HE 
HAS A VERY DELICATE CUT BACK 
THAT WAS A GOOD RECOVERY 
YES IT 
WAS A GOOD POT ON THE BLACK BUT IT 
IS AWKWARD CUEING HERE 
WHAT COLOUR CAN HE GET OFF THAT 
RED 
HE HAS MANAGED TO DROP IT IN RED AND HOLD FOR THE BLACK 
HE HAS GOT 
TO BE CAREFUL WITH BLACKS LIKE THIS IN IT WENT 
HE GOT THE EASY RED TO THE LEFT 
MIDDLE 
NO PROBLEM HERE JUST OFF THE SIDE 
CUSHION THERE WILL BE A COUPLE OF 
REDS AVAILABLE 
STILL NO NEED TO GO INTO THEM JUST 
YET 
THE ONLY THING HE HAD TO AVOID WAS 
LEAVING HIMSELF HAMPERED WITH THE 
BLACK 
HE PLAYS THAT SHOT SO WELL IF 
THERE IS A RED IN THE MIDDLE THAT 
WILL GO HE WILL PLAY TO GET ON IT 
IF NOT HE WILL CANNON INTO THE 
MIDDLE OF THOSE THREE REDS THAT 
WILL OPEN THAT UP HE PLAYED THE 
CANNON PERFECTLY 
YES HE JUST 
STOPPED FOR A SECOND BUT THEN HE 
WALKED ROUND SO YOU CAN ONLY 
ASSUME THAT YOU ARE RIGHT DENNIS 
HE HAS PLAYED IT PERFECTLY HE IS 
NICELY ON THE RED HE WILL BE A 
COUPLE OF SHOTS AHEAD NOW AFTER 
THIS RED AND THEN THE BLACK WHICH 
RED WILL HE BE PLAYING ON 
YES HE WAS NOT QUITE SURE AND THAT 
IS THE THING TO DO GET BACK UP 
AGAIN AND HAVE A LOOK AT THINGS 
THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO 
IN THIS 
GAME IS 
TO PLAY 
SHOCK 
HAVEN'T QUITE MADE UP YOUR MIND 
A SHOT HE LOOKED LITTLE EDGY AT 
THE START OF THE MATCH BUT HE CAME 
OUT AFTER THE INTERVAL AND THIS 
WAS THE START HE WAS AFTER ALWAYS 
GOOD IF YOU CAN WIN THE FRAME WITH 
ONE VISIT 
HE IS NOT MANY POTS AWAY FROM THAT 
HE HAS PLAYED THESE REALLY WELL HE HAS CUED PERFECTLY SO JUST THE 
BLACK NEEDED TO CLINCH THE FRAME 
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF A VERY 
HIGH BREAK HERE 
JOE PERRY STILL HOLDS THE HIGHEST 
BREAK AT THE MOMENT A BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO 
THERE IT IT IS PLENTY MORE POINTS 
TO OVERTAKE AT HERE THERE ARE 
PLENTY MORE POINTS 
YES IF HE 
TAKES BLACKS WITH THESE REMAINING 
REDS A POSSIBLE ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
HE IS THE NEAREST ONE TO STEPHEN 
HENDRY IN TERMS OF CENTURIES MADE 
HE HAS MADE FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN STEPHEN HENDRY 
JUST OVER SEVEN HUNDRED JUST THE BLACK FOR A 
TERRIFIC CENTURY BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED 
THIS IS WHAT THEY HAVE COME TO SEED 
THIS CROWD COME TO SEE JUST EIGHT MINUTES FOR THIS EFFORT 
STUNNING ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN TAKES THE HIGHEST 
BREAK THIS YEAR IN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP HE HAS SET TARGET 
WITH MAGNIFICENT EFFORT OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
AND HE LEADS THREE HAPPEN TO 
A VERY IMPRESSIVE AND THAT IS WHAT 
MAKES HIM A STAR HE LEADS THREE TO TWO 
INTO FRAME SIX IT IS MARK WILLIAMS 
ON THE TABLE 
WE HAVE HAD A LOOK AT ALL THE 
OPTIONS 
WHERE IS THE WHITE THAT IS O. K. 
THAT WAS LITTLE BIT OF VINTAGE 
MARK WILLIAMS FOR YEARS WE HAVE 
SAID THE BEST SINGLE BALL POTTER IN 
THE GAME BUT THERE ARE A FEW MORE 
AROUND THESE DAYS NEAL ROBERTSON 
IS ONE OF THEM 
COULD CLIP THIS ONE INTO THE RIGHT 
CORNER HE'S LOOKING AT THE OTHER 
ONE BUT I THINK THE ONE TO THE 
RIGHT CORNER IS THE BETTER CHOICE 
MARQUISE DOING PLENTY OF STROLLING 
AROUND THE TABLE MARK HE'S DOING 
MARK HE'S DOING PLENTY OF 
MAYBE TERRY HAS BEEN TEACHING HIM 
HOW TO WALK ROUND THE TABLE TERRY 
DID LIKE LITTLE STROLL AROUND THE 
TABLE AND A SKIP EVERY NOW AND THEN 
DO YOU REMEMBER YOU USED TO DO THE 
IMPERSONATION OF TERRY WALK FORD 
AND THE BACKWARD STEP JOHN YES YES USED TO FILL IN FIVE OR TEN MINUTES 
A WALK FORWARD AND THE BACKWARD 
STEP 
ALWAYS TRICKY THAT TYPE OF SHOT 
THE MIDDLE POCKETS ARE SO TIGHT 
ALSO YOU TOUCH A KNUCKLE AND THAT 
IS WHAT HAPPENS THIS MUST BE VERY 
TIGHT THAT'S BIT OF STRETCH 
ALSO BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ROOM 
HE IS COMING AROUND THE OTHER SIDE 
HAVE LOOK THAT IS HOW TIGHT IT IS IN FACT HE IS LOOKING AT THE 
OTHER RED 
I THINK HE IS 
LOOKING AT 
OTHER RED THE RED NEAREST THE 
CORNER POCKET 
I THINK HE CAN GET THROUGH TO IT 
IF HE CAN HE 
CAN STUN 
IT THROUGH 
AND BE ON THE BLACK 
AND IF HE PLAYS A LOVELY DELICATE 
LITTLE CANNON HERE HE WILL OPEN 
EVERYTHING UP IF HE CAN JUST 
CANNON THOSE TWO REDS IT WILL 
DEVELOP THE WHOLE OF THE TABLE HERE 
THIS WOULD BE A BODY BLOW FOR THE 
WELSHMAN BECAUSE MOCK UP WAS 
LOOKING VERY GOOD THERE UNTIL THAT 
DELICATE LITTLE ONE IN TO THE 
MIDDLE ONE BECAUSE MARK WAS 
LOOKING VERY GOOD 
RONNIE HAD A QUICK LOOK AT TO SCORE 
BOARD HE HAS REDUCED HIS ARREARS 
NOW FOURTEEN POINTS NOW TO FOURTEEN POINTS 
WITH THE COLOURS ON THE SPOTS 
THERE IS NO REAL PROBLEM RED THE 
ONE NEAR 
THE CUSHION 
NEAR THE BAULK 
LINE BUT 
THAT REALLY ISN'T THE 
PROBLEM HE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY 
PROBLEM GETTING ON THAT RED BIG 
FAVOURITE NOW FOR THE FRAME YEAH YEAH I SAID THAT RED WAS IDEALLY PLACED 
IT WAS PROBABLY THE WRONG WORD BUT 
IT IS BEEN AN EASY POTTABLE 
POSITION IT IS IN AN EASY 
POTTABLE POSITION 
HE WANTS TO GET AS CLOSE TO THAT 
RED AS POSSIBLE AND JUST OFF 
STRAIGHT SO SOMEWHERE NEAR THE 
WHITE WOULD BE O. K. IT HAS FINISHED 
A LITTLE BIT STRAIGHT BUT I STILL 
THINK HE CAN SCREW BACK HERE AND 
GET THE WHITE AWAY FROM THE CUSHION 
SO IT WILL BE BACK FOR BLUE OR PINK 
HERE 
YES I THINK HE PURPOSELY PLAYED 
FOR THE PINK BECAUSE HE COULD GET 
HIS HAND ON THE TABLE THE FURTHER 
AWAY FROM THE CUSHION HE WAS CAN'T 
SEE AN OBSTACLE NOW HE IS NOW SIX 
POINTS IN FRONT 
PLAYING FOR A BAULK COLOUR OF 
COURSE BECAUSE THE BAULK COLOUR IS 
EASIER TO GET ONTO THE YELLOW 
QUITE AN IMPORTANT FRAME ALTHOUGH 
IT IS THE BEST OF TWENTY FIVE MARK WILLIAMS 
HAD A CHANCE TO DRAW LEVEL 
YES HE HAD TWO CHANCES THE FIRST 
ONE HE WAS UNLUCKY WHEN HE WENT 
INTO THE REDS AND FINISHED ON 
NOTHING ANY PRODUCED A GOOD POT TO 
GIVE HIM A SECOND CHANCE 
MISSED A 
TRICKY RED IN THE MIDDLE AND AT 
THIS LEVEL JUST SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT SENDS YOU BACK TO YOUR CHAIR 
AND THAT IS WHERE YOU SIT UNTIL THE 
FRAME IS OVER AND IT IS OVER NOW 
THE BROWN WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED 
BRILLIANTLY PLAYED BY RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN MARK WILLIAMS HAD TWO 
CHANCES RONNIE O'SULLIVAN JUST 
NEEDED ONE MARK HAD A CLEARANCE OF 
EIGHTY ONE NOW WITH A TWO FRAME LEAD AT FOUR 
TWO TWO SO INTO FRAME SEVEN IT IS RONNIE 
AT THE TABLE AND HE'S BEHIND BY FOURTEEN 
POINTS THAT WAS A POOR SHOT FROM RONNIE 
PRETTY GOOD BUT I SUPPOSE WHAT WE 
FORGET JOHN IS THAT MARK WILLIAMS 
HAS NOT BEEN IN THIS SITUATION FOR 
A LONG WHILE HE HAS BEEN LOSING 
EARLY ON IN TOURNAMENTS HE IS AT 
PROVISIONAL NUMBER TWENTY SIX BUT HE WAS 
DOWN AT FORTY TWO AT ONE STAGE IT TAKES A 
BIT OF GETTING USED TO DOESN'T IT 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT RED NEXT TO 
THE BLACK GOES HE HAS HAD A 
AT IT BUT IT LOOKS PRETTY TIGHT HE 
HAS OTHER OPTIONS HERE HE HAS THE 
ONE TO THE LEFT OF THE BUNCH MAYBE 
IT GOES MUST GO HE WOULDN'T HAVE 
PUT THE WHITE THERE 
WELL NOW HE DOESN'T LIKE IT FROM FROM OUR PICTURE LOOKS AS THOUGH HE 
CAN HE DOESN'T HAVE TO PLAY FOR 
THE BLACK OFF COURSE HE CAN PLAY 
FOR THE PINK 
THE OTHER ONE GOES 
SO IF HE DOESN'T FEEL AS IF HE CAN 
SEE ENOUGH 
OF IT TAKE THE OTHER 
SEE ENOUGH OF IT TAKE THE OTHER ONE THAT WAS HIS THIRD TIME OF 
GETTING DOWN TO THAT ONE 
IF HE IS DEAD STRAIGHT ON THE PINK 
HE CAN'T GET INTO THE REDS SO HE 
WILL HAVE TO PLAY FOR THE ONE 
IS NEXT TO THE BLACK AND EVEN THAT 
HE WILL HAVE TO FORCE IT IN 
FORTY EIGHT N. T. S. THE LEAD STILL A POSSIBLE SEVENTY FIVE LEFT ON THE TABLE 
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING TO 
PLAY FOR HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO 
PLAY THE CANNON L. CAN'T SEE A RED 
THAT IS POSSIBLE PORTABLE WITHOUT 
DISTURBING SOMETHING 
AND IT IS 
TRICKY BECAUSE THE PINK IS AWAY 
FROM THE REDS 
IS THERE ONE AVAILABLE INTO THE 
MIDDLE POCKET THAT WAS A TRICKY 
LITTLE CANNON THAT HE NEEDED THERE 
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY KICK I 
THINK MARK DIDN'T CUE THAT VERY 
WELL IT WAS A BIT TIGHT 
SURELY HISTORY CAN'T REPEAT ITSELF 
MARK WAS IN THE DRIVING SEAT IN THE 
PREVIOUS FRAME HE HAD A BREAK OF 
FORTY PLUS AND THEN LOST THE FRAME 
HE IS NOT HAVING MUCH JOY WITH THE 
LONG POTS HE IS DOWN TO NINE PER CENT THAT'S 
NOT GOOD ONE IN ELEVEN HE HAS BEEN A 
SUCCESSFUL WITH RONNIE SO IF HE 
HAS HAD A WEAKNESS THIS EVENING 
LONG POTTING THAT'S IT 
OH MARK DEAR ME HE KNEW HE WAS 
RUNNING INTO THE OTHER REDS BUT I 
DIDN'T EXPECT HIM TO MISS THE POT 
THAT'S QUITE AMAZING LOOK HOW THE 
REDS HAVE FINISHED L. THINK RONNIE 
WAS ALMOST READY TO CONCEDE THE 
FRAME 
HE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT RONNIE MAKES 
SOME SORT OF SLIP UP HERE 
HE'S GOT TO AVOID THE CANNON ON THE 
RED THAT'S NEAR THE PINK SPOT HERE 
HE DECIDED TO GO AT THE SIDE OF THE 
TABLE THE REASON HE WAS AVERSE TO 
PLAYING THIS HE KNEW THE CUE BALL 
WOULD BE 
CLOSE TO THE SIDE CUSHION 
WOULD BE CLOSE TO THE SIDE CUSHION PLENTY OF POINTS TO PLAY WITH 
YOU POINTED OUT HIS LONG POT 
SUCCESS RATE WAS VERY VERY LOW FOR 
RONNIE BUT HIS OVERALL POT SUCCESS 
AND NINETY ONE PER CENT WHEN HE IS IN LIKE THIS 
THIS IS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY HE HAS 
BEEN PRESENTED WITH HERE 
AND LOOK AT THE RED OVER THE LEFT 
SIDE OF THE TABLE IT IS IN 
SIMILAR POSITION TO THE RED THAT 
MARK WILLIAMS MISSED IN THE 
PREVIOUS FRAME THEN RONNIE CLEARED 
WITH EIGHTY ONE 
BUT RONNIE IS A LITTLE BIT CLOSER 
TO THAT ONE 
IT IS THE YELLOW THAT IS OFF ITS 
SPOT HE HAS GOT TO 
GET RIGHT 
UP 
THE TABLE ON TO THAT 
AND NORMALLY YOU WOULD PLAY FOR THE 
BLUE WITH THE YELLOW OFF ITS SPOT 
IN SUCH WAY BLUE OR BAULK COLOUR 
WOULD DO GREEN IS THE BALL THAT 
WERE GETTING TO THE YELLOW 
LOOK AT 
THE SCORE BOARD JUST CONFIRMS HE 
NEEDS THE SIX REMAINING COLOURS 
AFTER THIS GREEN AND THIS ONE WILL 
HURT MARK WILLIAMS MORE THAN THE 
LAST 
NO EXCUSE FOR MISSING THE RED HE 
DID ALWAYS FEEL THIS IS THE KEY 
SHOT DENNIS THE BROWN TO THE BLUE 
IF HE GETS PERFECT ON THE BLUE IT 
IS A FORMALITY THIS IS THE KEY 
SHOT TO THE FRAME 
COULD HAVE PLAYED IT BETTER BUT 
THIS IS WHERE THE LEFT HAND COULD 
PROVE VERY USEFUL IT WAS A TRICKY LITTLE CUT IN 
MARK WILLIAMS SHOULD HAVE WON THE 
FRAME BUT RONNIE HAS CLEARED WITH A 
BREAK OF FIFTY NINE HE NOW GOES FIVE TO TWO IN 
FRONT FRONT O. K. INTO THE LAST FRAME OF THE 
SESSION IT IS THE 
ROCKET AT 
TABLE AND THERE IS NO SCORE 
HE CAN'T BY A LONG POT TONIGHT BUT 
HE STILL KEEPS TAKING THEM ON YES YES AND EVERY LONG POT BUT HE SEEMS TO 
MISS HITS TO FALL SO HE JUST MUST 
BE PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF 
UNINTENTIONAL SIDE ON THE CUE BALL 
THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK SOMETHING 
HE WILL BE WORKING ON I'M CERTAIN 
WELL HE HAS GOT TO SIT THERE 
SIPPING HIS WATER A LITTLE SHAKE 
OF THE HEAD AND IF THE NEXT SHOT 
WORKS OUT BOUQUET FROM MARK 
WILLIAMS HE WILL GIVE HIMSELF A 
CHANCE HE NORMALLY LIKES TO PICK 
THEM OFF ONE AT A TIME BUT WITH 
THE BLACK 
ON 
THE SIDE CUSHION AND THE PINK OUT OF COMMISSION HE HAS 
GOT TO GO INTO THEM SOONER RATHER 
THAN LATER 
DIDN'T CATCH THE PINK FULL BALL 
THERE THIS WOULD DEFINITELY HELP 
BLACK BACK ON ITS SPOT WILL 
DEFINITELY HELP 
IT'S FOR ME WE SAID AT THE START 
OF THE MATCH THAT MARK WAS TAKING 
HIS TIME WALKING ROUND THE TABLE 
WONDERING IF IT WAS THE RIGHT 
TACTIC BUT HE HAS CERTAINLY 
SPEEDED UP HERE 
THIS IS MORE HIS 
NATURAL GAME HERE ISN'T IT 
HE DOESN'T RUN ROUND THE TABLE BUT 
HE IS A VERY QUICK PLAYER IT IS A 
NICE PACE 
WHEN HE 
IS GOING WELL 
YES I THINK HE IS ANNOYED AT 
LOSING 
THE LAST 
FRAME IN THE MANNER 
HE DID BUT THIS GAME CAN BE VERY 
ANNOYING AT TIMES THERE IS ONE 
LOOSE RED SO HE WILL HAVE TO POT 
THE RED AND COME ROUND THE TWO 
CUSHIONS IT IS ALL ABOUT LINE AND 
LENGTH A GOOD LINE WHAT ABOUT THE 
LENGTH WELL PLAYED WELL PLAYED 
INDEED 
HE NEEDS A GOOD CANNON TO DEVELOP A 
COUPLE OF THEM HE MIGHT JUST BE O. K. ALMOST STUCK ON THAT RED 
MARK'S HIGHEST BREAK IS SIXTY FIVE IN FRAME 
TWO 
THIS IS COMING JUST AT THE RIGHT 
TIME I. F. A. HE HAD SETTLED FOR FIVE THREE 
ALTHOUGH HE COULD QUITE EASILY HAVE 
LED FIVE TO THREE I THINK HE COULD HAVE 
SETTLED FOR FIVE TO THREE 
THAT IS IT RONNIE NOW NEEDS A 
SNOOKER HE HAS TAKEN THESE VERY 
WELL AS FLUENT AS HE HAS BEEN ALL 
WEEK IT IS FUNNY HE HAS PLAYED 
MORE FLUIDLY AND HE HAS HAD LOT BETTER CONTROL OF THE CUE BALL 
THE NEXT SESSION OF THIS MATCH 
RESUMES TOMORROW EVENING THAT WILL 
BE VERY ENJOYABLE IT HAS BEEN A 
REALLY ENJOYABLE SESSION THIS WE 
HAVE SEEN SOME HIGH CLASS SAFETY 
TACTICAL SNOOKERING AND 
MARVELLOUS ONE HUNDRED FORTY FROM RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN 
YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID O'SULLIVAN THEY JOHN HE DID AND 
IMPERSONATION OF JOE SWAIL'S CUE 
ACTION DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID 
THERE JOHN 
WELL THE RED HAS NOT GONE IN BUT 
THAT EIGHTY EIGHT BREAK IS MORE THAN ENOUGH 
TO WIN THAT FRAME EIGHT FRAMES 
INTRIGUING ENTHRALLING RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN LEADS FIVE TO THREE BUT WHAT A 
SESSION WE HAVE HAD 
SO FIVE TO THIRTY FOUR RONNIE OVERNIGHT 
FAIR ENOUGH 
YES I THINK SO THE 
HIGHEST BREAK OF THE EVENT HE WILL 
BE PLEASED WITH HIS WORK MARK 
WILLIAMS HOW RELAXED KENYA BE 
DOING AS THEIR IMPRESSIONS OF 
OTHER PLAYERS 
A COUPLE OF FORMER 
WORLD CHAMPIONS TODAY WERE NOT 
QUITE SO RELAXED 
THIS MORNING ALI CARTER TURNED 
SIX TO TWO OVERNIGHT LEAD INTO ROUT OF 
SHAUN MURPHY THIS EVENING THE 
ESSEX TRAINEE PILOT NEEDED ONLY ONE 
BITE OF THE CHERRY TO FLY INTO THE 
QUARTER FINALS THIRTEEN TO FOUR 
I PLAYED WELL I PLAYED WELL 
YESTERDAY L. PLAYED BETTER 
YESTERDAY THAN I DID TODAY SHAUN 
DID NOT PERFORM YESTERDAY IT WAS 
DOWN TO ME PUTTING HIM UNDER 
PRESSURE I THINK BUT TODAY HE 
HAD A FEW CHANCES BUT I WAS ABLE 
TO TAKE 
CAPITALISE ON THEM 
I M. PLEASED TO BE IN THE QUARTER 
FINAL HERE 
A LOT OF IT WAS JUST MY 
OWN POOR PLAY L. WOULD HOLD MY 
HANDS UP AND SAY I HAVE WORKED 
VERY HARD BUT FOR SOME REASON I 
HAD A BAD SESSION SIX TO TWO IS A LOT 
BETTER THAN TWELVE TO FOUR AND I STILL FELT 
I WAS IN THE MATCH AND HAD A CHANCE 
I THINK MY DAY TO DAY WAS SUMMED UP 
IN THE VERY FIRST FRAME WHERE I GOT 
IN STRAIGHT OFF OFF ALI'S BREAK UP 
I SPLIT THE REDS 
PERFECTLY AND 
HAD 
A 
REALLY BIG 
KICK ON THE RED IT 
PRETTY MUCH SUMMED UP MY DAY YOU YOU THINK YOU HAVE EVERYTHING TO LOSE 
BUT 
YOU STILL 
HAVE THE MATCH TO WIN 
I HAD A LITTLE KICK BUT I WAS SO 
HYPED UP I COULD NOT SLEEP I 
HAD A LITTLE NOW IT WAS NICE TO GO 
OUT THERE TONIGHT AND NOT HAVE TO 
SWEAT TO GET THE CHANCE AND TAKE IT 
AND WIN 
IF THE SEVEN TIMES WORLD CHAMPION 
SECURED VICTORY THIS AFTERNOON 
AGAINST CHINA'S DING JUNHUI THE 
DAMAGE WAS DONE YESTERDAY WHEN 
HENDRY TOOK AN ELEVEN TO FIVE OVERNIGHT LEAD 
AND HE BOOKED HIS FIRST QUARTER 
FINAL PLACE IN THREE YEARS 
IT WAS IMPORTANT PLAYING SOMEONE 
LIKE DING JUNHUI TO TRY AND GET A 
LEAD EARLY HE IS STILL YOUNG AND 
PERHAPS NOT AS EXPERIENCED AS A LOT 
OF PLAYERS PLAYING AT THE CRUCIBLE 
I HAVE SEEN HIM IN MATCHES HIS 
HEAD GO DOWN WHEN PEOPLE HAVE GOT 
ON TOP OF HIM L. HAD THAT IN THE 
IF I COULD GET AN EARLY LEAD I 
COULD PUSH MY ADVANTAGE AND IT 
WORKED OUT THAT WAY 
IF 
DEFENDING CHAMPION WAS IN ACTION 
TODAY TODAY HE RESUMED HIS MATCH AT EIGHT TO EIGHT WHICH 
QUICKLY CHANGED TO NINE TWELVE IT IS 
RYAN AT THE TABLE AND HE IS LEADING 
THIS IS NOT GREAT THE PINK WOULD 
BE THE PERFECT SHOT TO GUARANTEE 
POSITIONAL SHOT HE KNEW THAT WAS A BIG SHOT 
THE WINNER OF STEPHEN HENDRY DING 
JUNHUI AWAITS SO IT WILL NOT GET 
ANY EASIER HE COULD BE FACING A 
SEVEN TIMES WORLD CHAMPION IN THE 
NEXT MATCH YOU CAN SEE HIS 
DEMEANOUR CHANGING A DIFFER THERE 
NOW HE KNOWS THIS IS A CHANCE TO 
WIN THE MATCH YOU CAN SEE HIS 
DEMEANOUR CHANGING THERE 
HE HAS GOT THE RED IN HE HAS JUST 
OVERRUN SLIGHTLY HE MAY HAVE TO 
PLAY A LITTLE CANNON HERE YOU 
CANNOT SEE IT GOING WRONG IF HE'D 
JUST DROP THE PINK IN AND CANNON 
INTO THOSE TWO REDS BELOW THE PINK 
YOU THINK HE WOULD BE ON SOMETHING 
IN GOES THE PINK AND HE IS NICELY 
ON THE RED L. CANNOT SEE HIM MAKING A MISTAKE NOW 
RYAN DAY HAS BEEN HERE FIVE TIMES 
THIS IS HIS FIFTH APPEARANCE AT THE 
CRUCIBLE HE HAS YET TO GET PAST 
THE SECOND ROUND HE HAS NEVER 
PLAYED IN A QUARTER FINAL THIS 
SHOT COULD GET HIM THERE L. THINK 
HE IS IN THE QUARTER FINAL NOW AND 
BOY HAS HE PLAYED VERY WELL HE 
WAS FOUR TO ZERO BEHIND EVERYBODY CROSSED 
HIM OFF HE CAME OUT OF THE FIRST 
SESSION TRAILING FIVE TO THREE HE DID NOT 
LET HIS HEAD GO DOWN ON TWO 
OCCASIONS HE HAS WON FOUR FRAMES 
ON THE TROT PUTTING HIGGINS UNDER 
PRESSURE TO BE FAIR HIGGINS HAS 
CRACKED A LITTLE BIT UNDER THE 
PRESSURE AND IT IS HARD OUT THERE 
WHEN YOU ARE A WORLD CHAMPION HE 
HAS BEEN AS YOU WOULD EXPECT A 
GREAT AMBASSADOR FOR THE GAME A 
FABULOUS GUY AND ONE OF THE GAME'S 
GREAT PLAYERS RYAN DAY HAS BEATEN 
ONE OF THE ALL TIME GREATS 
THE CHAMPION HAS GONE BUT HE WILL 
BE BACK HE WILL BE SO DISAPPOINTED 
HE PLAYED FABULOUSLY IN THE FIRST 
ROUND AGAINST MATTHEW STEVENS AND 
IN THE FIRST FOUR FRAMES AGAINST 
RYAN DAY RYAN DAY'S ADRENALIN NOW 
WILL BE ABSOLUTELY BUBBLING INSIDE 
IT IS THE GREATEST FEELING IN THE 
WORLD THAT WHEN HE BEAT A PLAYER 
THAT YOU ARE MADE THE SECOND 
FAVOURITE TO BEAT NOT MANY FRAME 
WINNING BREAKS AT ONE VISIT BUT 
GOODNESS ME HAS HE POTTED WELL

HIM THE BEST OF LUCK FOR THE NEXT 
ROUND THAT WAS A FABULOUS MATCH 
HE BEAT THE TWO TIMES WORLD 
CHAMPION AND HE GOES INTO THE 
QUARTER FINAL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
HIS CAREER 
IT WAS A TOUGH GAME FOR ME AND IT 
BECAME MORE DIFFICULT WHEN JOHN GOT 
OFF TO THE START THAT HE 
DID I 
HAD 
TO DIG IN BUT THESE LONGER MATCHES 
ALLOW 
YOU TO 
STAY CALM WHEN THINGS 
ARE NOT GOING WELL YOU KNOW THERE 
ARE LOT THERE IS LOTS OF TIME FOR THINGS
