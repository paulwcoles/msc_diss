WE GOT TO HELP EACH OTHER BECOME ARISTOS OURSELVES 
AND WE CAN KICK THE OTHER BASTARDS GOODBYE 
YOU MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT FOR ME 
THEY PUT ME IN PRISON BECAUSE OF YOU 
IT GAVE ME BAD THOUGHTS ABOUT YOU 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WILL DO WITH YOU THESE ARISTOS OF MINE UNLESS I MAKE THEM LISTEN TO ME 
THEY MEAN TO PARADE YOU BEFORE THE WORLD'S PRESS 
HAVE A SHOW TRIAL 
HANG SOME PEOPLE 
WHEN THEY START TO DO THAT IT WILL BE SHEER OVERSIGHT IF THEY DON'T HANG ME TOO 
THEY WOULD PREFER AN AMERICAN 
BUT THEY'LL SETTLE FOR AN ENGLISHMAN UNTIL THEY CAN GET HOLD OF THE REAL THING 
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS SIR MAGNUS 
I AM SICK OF BAD SUPERIORS 
BAD FOOD 
BAD PRISONS BAD TORTURERS 
IT'S TIME I LOOKED AFTER YOUR CAREER AND YOU LOOKED AFTER MINE 
THIS TIME PROPERLY NO BOURGEOIS SHRINKING BACK FROM THE BIG SCOOPS 
THIS TIME WE ARE PROFESSIONALS 
I MEAN IT 
SIR MAGNUS YOU HAVE IN THE PAST BETRAYED ME 
BUT MORE IMPORTANT YOU HAVE BETRAYED YOURSELF 
EVEN WHEN YOU TELL THE TRUTH YOU LIE 
YOU HAVE LOYALTY AND YOU HAVE AFFECTION BUT TO I DON'T KNOW 
ONE DAY MAYBE YOU WILL TELL ME MAYBE YOU HAVE PUT YOUR LOVE IN SOME BAD PLACES NOW AND THEN 
YET YOU ALSO HAVE MORALITY YOU SEARCH 
WHAT I AM SAYING SIR MAGNUS IS FOR ONCE NATURE HAS PRODUCED A PERFECT MATCH 
YOU ARE A PERFECT SPY 
ALL YOU NEED IS A CAUSE 
I HAVE IT 
I KNOW THE REVOLUTION IS YOUNG AND SOMETIMES THE WRONG PEOPLE RUN IT 
IN THE PURSUIT OF PEACE WE MAKE TOO MUCH WAR LOOKING FOR FREEDOM WE BUILD TOO MANY PRISONS 
BUT IN THE LONG RUN I DON'T MIND 
BECAUSE I KNOW ALL THE JUNK THAT MADE YOU WHAT YOU ARE
