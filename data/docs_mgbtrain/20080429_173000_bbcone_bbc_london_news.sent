WHO PRESIDED OVER THE FIASCO OF 
WEMBLEY WEMBLEY ALL RIGHT TONIGHT THE MULTI 
MILLION POUND DESIGNER CANCER CARE 
CENTRE OFFERING SUPPORT TO THEIR 
PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AS 
CHELSEA PREPARE FOR THEIR CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE SHOWDOWN TOMORROW WITH 
LIVERPOOL THE FALL OUT FOR THE 
WEEKEND'S BATTLE AT THE BRIDGE 
CONTINUES PLUS WILL THE APRIL 
SHOWERS SUBSIDE WE WILL HAVE THE 
FORECAST 
GOOD EVENING A LONDON LABOUR M. P. IS 
AT THE CENTRE OF A ROW TONIGHT 
AFTER OFFERING TO HELP THE 
CONSERVATIVE MAYORAL CANDIDATE IF 
HE IS ELECTED THE FORMER MINISTER 
KATE HOEY HAS AGREED TO ADVICE 
BORIS JOHNSON ON SPORT AND THE 
OLYMPICS SHOULD HE TAKE CONTROL OF 
CITY HALL LATER THIS WEEK SHE 
INSIST THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS 
BACKING MR. JOHNSON BUT THE PRIME 
MINISTER GORDON BROWN HAS DISMISSED 
THE STOEFRY AS SPIN STORY AS 
HE MAY HAVE MISSED THE TARGET 
SEVERAL TIMES HERE TODAY BUT HE 
NETTED A GOOD ONE ON HIS TEAM TO 
BOOST SPORT IN THE CAPITAL AHEAD OF 
THE OLYMPICS WILL BE YES A LABOUR 
M. P. NOT ONLY THAT A FORMER SPORTS 
MINISTER 
SHE IS A A DISTINGUISHED MINISTER LONDON M. P. AND A FORMER MINISTER FOR 
SPORT SHE KNOWS THE SCENE 
BACKWARDS AND I THINK SHE IS VERY 
FRUSTRATE WITH WHAT IS GOING ON AT 
THE MOMENT AND WANTS TO SEE A NEW 
IMPETUS 
IT'S THE TIMING MORE IMPETUS ASTONISHING THAN THE FACT ITSELF 
KATE HOEY TODAY INSISTED IT DIDN'T 
MEAN SHE ENDORSED BORIS JOHNSON BUT 
MOST WILL THINK OTHERWISE OF 
I AM 
NOT DEFECTING FROM THE LABOUR PARTY 
I AM A LABOUR M. P. AND I HAVE BEEN 
LABOUR ALL MY LIFE WHAT MATTERS TO 
ME IS WHAT THE MAYOR WHO GETS 
ELECTED DOES IF I CAN HELP 
INFLUENCE THAT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING 
WRONG WITH THAT L. DO ACCEPT THAT 
PERHAPS THE TYPING COULD HAVE BEEN 
BETTER 
KATE HOEY IS A MAVERICK A BETTER FREQUENT CRITIC OF HER OWN 
GOVERNMENT IN THE PAST SHE WAS 
SACKED AS SPORTS MINISTER IN TWO THOUSAND ONE 
TARRED OVER THE DELAYS IN 
DEVELOPING THE NEW WEMBLEY STADIUM 
DEDESCRIBING HER TODAY AS CITY 
DETACHED KEN LIVINGSTONE WAS 
WITHERING 
WHY WOULD ANYONE APPOINT WITHERING AS THEIR SPORTS MINISTER THE 
PERSON WHO PRESIDE OVER THE FIASCO 
OF WEMBLEY IT WOULD BE LIKE TAKING 
THE OLD BUS COMPANYS WHO HAD RIPPED 
EVERYONE OFF AND PUTTING THEM IN 
CHARGE OF TRANSPORT 
I AM ASHAMED 
TO SAY THAT KATE HOEY IS MY LOCAL 
M. P. TO BE HONEST SHE IS BONKERS 
TEAMING UP WITH BORIS SHE WOULD 
MAKE THE PERFECT COUPLE KATE HOEY 
DID FAIL TO ENDORSE HIM BY NAME 
TODAY THE FEELING ENTIRELY MUTE 
YUL WITH TWO DAYS TO GO UNTIL THE 
ELECTION AN UNWELCOME DISTRACTION 
WHEN HE WANTED TO AHEIGHT THE FREE 
TRAVEL FOR THE ELD LETTERLY WHILE 
ALL OF THE CANDIDATES PROMISE TO 
RUN INCLUSIVE ADMINISTRATION IT'S 
HE WHO HAS BAGGED ONE OF THE ENEMY 
WITH THE EFFECT COULD HAVE BEFORE 
AN ELECTION 
WELL OVER THE LAST 
WEEK WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THE 
LEADERS OF THREE MAIN PARTIES PRIOR 
TO THURSDAY'S MAYORAL ELECTIONS 
PRIME MINISTER GORDON BROWN WAS 
UNAVAILABLE BUT HE SENT HARRIET 
HARMAN INSTEAD TWO DAYS BEFORE AN 
ELECTION TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS HAPPEN PRETTY EMBRS AING I I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS NOT KATE 
HOEY BACKING BORIS YOU HAVE SEEN 
FROM YOUR OWN PACKAGE SHE IS 
ABSOLUTELY NOT SAYING SHE IS 
BACKING BORIS JOHNSON BUT I THINK 
ONE THING WE DO KNOW ABOUT KATE 
SHOW HOEY IS SHE IS PASSIONATE 
ABOUT SPORT SHE WOULD WORK WITH 
ANYONE TO FURTHER THE CAUSE OF 
SPORT WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION 
OF ROBERT MUGABE 
SHE HAS SAID THAT THE TIMING OF 
THIS IS PRETTY CRUCIAL WHAT YOU 
HAVE GOT IS LONG STANDING LONDON 
M. P. WHOSE EXPERT TEASE IN SPORT 
AGREEING TOWORK WITH A TORY MAYOR 
EVEN BEFORE HE IS ELECTED THE THE REALITY IS ACROSS LONDON PEOPLE DO 
WORK TOGETHER ON A WHOLE RANGE OF 
ISSUES 
PRIOR TO AN ELECTION SHE ISSUES SHE SAID HERSELF THAT THEY THINKS THE 
TIMING COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER L. 
DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY POINT IN 
MAKING THIS OUT TO ANYTHING OTHER 
THAN IT IS SHE ASK A LABOUR M. P. 
KATE HOEY IS BACKING THE LABOUR 
PARTY CAMPAIGN SHE IS MY 
NEIGHBOURING M. P. IN SOUTH LONDON 
SHE IS PART OF THE LABOUR TEAM 
BECAUSE SHE CARES ABOUT THE THINGS 
THAT LABOUR AND LONDON CARES ABOUT 
WITH I IS MORE POLICE ON STREET 
BETTER TRANSPORT 
IS SHE STILL PART 
OF THE LABOUR CAMPAIGN 
SHE IS VERY 
MUCH PART OF THE LABOUR CAMPAIGN 
IT'S NOT TRUE L. KNOW YOUR HEADLINE 
WAS SHE WAS BACKING BORIS BUT SHE 
IS NOT SHE IS JUST SAYING THAT 
THEY IS SOMEONE WHO LIKE ALL OF US 
WORKS WITH A WHOLE RANGE OF PEOPLE 
ON DIFFERENT PARTS FROM DIFFERENT 
PARTIES 
IS SHE BACKING CLIFR SHE PARTIES SHE IS BACKING KEN LIVINGSTONE 
SHEFRPBLGTS BACKING LABOUR KEN IS 
THE LABOUR CANDIDATE IS SHE 
BACKING CLIFR KEN IS THE KIF 
KEN IS THE KEN LIVINGSTONE YOU 
HAVE ME CONFUSED KEN IS THE LABOUR 
CANDIDATE KATE HAS SAID SHE IS 
BACKING LABOUR YOU KNOW I AM 
CONFIDENT OF HER SUPPORT SO SHE IS 
BACKING KEN LIVINGSTONE L. AM SURE 
SHE WILL BE 
YOU ARE NOT SURE BUT 
YOU THINK SHE MIGHT BE 
SHE IS 
CERTAINLY NOT BACKING BORIS AND SHE 
SAID SHE IS BACKING LABOUR OUR 
CAMPAIGN IS VERY CLEAR WHAT WE 
STAND FOR AND KATE IS BACKING US UP 
SHE HAS BEEN OUT AND ABOUT ON THE 
STREETS KNOCKING ON DOORS WITH THE 
LABOUR TEAM 
TALKING ABOUT BEING OUT ON THE 
STREETS ONE THING BORIS JOHNSON HAS 
BEEN DOING HE HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING 
ON PEOPLE'S GENUINE FEAR OF CRIME 
KEN LIVINGSTONE'S TEAM MUST HAVE 
BEEN FEARIOUS WHEN YOU TURN UP IN 
HIS CONSTITUENCY WEARING A STAB 
PROOF VEST 
LET'S JUST DEAL WITH WHAT IS BEING 
PUT FORWARD BY KEN LIVINGSTONE HE 
HAS ROLLED OUT NEIGHBOURHOOD 
POLICING THAT IS POLICE ON THE 
STREET IN EVERY LOCALITY WHERE 
LOCAL POLICE CAN KNOW THE TELEPHONE 
NUMBER OF THE POLICE 
LET'S NOT 
DODGE THE ISSUE FIGURES ASIDE 
CRIME FIGURES ASIDE WHAT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT IS PEOPLE'S FEAR OF 
CRIME MUCH YOU WEARING A STAB PROOF 
VEST DOESN'T IT REINFORCE THAT 
MESSAGE AND SAY EVEN I DON'T FEEL 
SAFE ON THE STREET 
WHAT HAPPENED 
WAS I WAS GOING OUT WITH MY LOCAL 
NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICE TEAM IN 
PECKHAM BECAUSE THEY DO A REALLY 
GOOD JOB AND CRIME AS A RESULT OF 
THEIR WORK 
DID YOU FEEL SAFE OF OF COURSE I FEEL SAFE L. AM OUT IN MY 
OWN CONSTITUENCY DAY IN DAY OUT 
BECAUSE I WAS TECHNICALLY ON PATROL 
WITH THE POLICE THEY GAVE ME THE 
GEAR TO WEAR L. JUST PUT IT ON AND 
THAT WAS IT 
SO YOU ACCEPT DO YOU 
ACCEPT TO SOME EXTENT THAT WOULD 
HAVE DAMAGED WHAT KEN LIVINGSTONE 
IS SAYING THAT CRIME IS DOWN AND 
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THAT SAME FEAR OF 
CRIME YOU HAVE IN EFFECT 
REINFORCED BORIS JOHNSON'S POINT OF 
VIEW 
I DON'T THINK I HAVE L. THINK VIEW THAT THE FIGURES ABOUT WHETHER YOU 
ARE LIKELY TO BE YOU ARE LESS 
LIKELY TO BE A VICTIM OF CRIME IN 
LONDON THAN FOR PREVIOUS YEARS I 
THINK THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT IS THE 
CASE AND KNOW THAT IT'S PARTLY A 
RESULT OF THE VERY GOOD 
NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICE TEAMS THAT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE HAS ROLLED OUT WE ARE 
CLEAR WHAT OUR AGENDA IS WE WANT A 
PROSPEROUS CITY GOOD PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT AND GOOD POLICE AND MORE 
HOUSING THAT IS THE ISSUE THAT 
PEOPLE WILL VOTE ON ON THURSDAY 
MORE TO COME BETWEEN NOW AND SEVEN 
INCLUDING 
THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR INCLUDING YOUR VOTES BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT TO 
DO WHEN YOU GO INTO THE POLLING 
BOOTH

TO MAKE THE WITNESSES WHILE GIVING 
EVIDENCE MORE COMFORTABLE THE CASE 
THE TRIAL IS EXPECT TO LAST AT 
LEAST ONE WEEK THE DEFENDANT 
DENIES MURDER 
MANY THANKS FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN ENGLAND A CENTRE 
DESIGNED TO OFFER SUPPORT FOR 
CANCER PATIENT HASS OPENED ITS 
DOORS IN WEST LONDON KNOWN AS A 
MAGIES CENTRE IT'S DESIGNED TO 
PROVIDE THE COMFORT AND CARE A 
HOSPITAL CAN'T AT MAGGIES THEY 
DON'T CLAIM EXCITING ARCHITECTURE 
WILL HELP YOU BEAT CANCER BUT THEY 
DO BELIEVE IT WILL RELIEVE STRESS 
AND ANXIETY AMONG THOSE AFFECTED BY 
THE DISEASE A HIGH WALL SHIELDS 
YOU FROM LONDON TRAFFIC IT HAS 
NONE OF THE FEATURES OF ITS 
NEIGHBOURING CHARING CROSS HOSPITAL 
EITHER IT'S BEATING HEART IS A 
KITCHEN FIRST THING THEY DO IS PUT 
THE KETTLE ON 
WHEN YOU COME INTO 
THE CENTRE IT'S LIKE THAT THE 
PEOPLE HAVE IMAGERY PIXIE DUST 
THEY SPRINKLE IT OVER PEOPLE YOU 
DON'T REALISE IT'S HAPPENING TO YOU 
BUT IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS THE THE CHARITY WAS FOUNDED BY MAGGIE 
KESWICK WHO WAS A CANCER PATIENT 
HERSELF THE FIVE CENTRES ARE 
DESIGNED BY SOME OF THE MOST DARING 
ARCHITECTS IN THE WORLD AND PAID 
FOR BY DONATIONS THIS ONE WAS 
CREATED BY LORD ROGERS SHE SHE DESCRIBED VERY WELL WHAT SHE 
THOUGHT SHE WANTED TO DO FOR PEOPLE 
WHO HAD CANCER SHE DESCRIBED HOW 
SHE WENT KNOCKED ON THE DOOR OF A 
CANCER SHE WAS FINE AND THEN THE 
DOOR OPENED AND SHE WAS IN A 
CORRIDOR AND THE WORLD HAD 
COLLAPSED IN FRONT OF HER SHE SAID 
THERE HAS TO BE A PLACE OF COMFORT 
WHERE YOU CAN CRY AND MEET OTHERS 
AND GET SOME PERSPECTIVE THE THE CENTRE WAS OPENED TODAY BY THE 
PRIME MINISTER'S WIFE AND BY 
NIGELLA LAWSON WHO HAS LOST THREE 
FAMILY MEMBERS TO CANCER THERE ARE 
NOW PLANS FOR A FURTHER FIVE 
CENTRES IN ENGLAND AND WALES 
STAY WITH US COMING UP CHELSEA'S 
BOSS ON THE SCUFFLE THAT IS 
OVERSHADOWING THEIR LATE SURGE FOR 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE AND MEET 
CHARLIE AND LOLA MY BESTEST NEW 
FRIENDS THEY HAVE GONE FROM BOOK 
TO SCREEN TO STAGE STARS L. WILL TELL YOU MORE LATER 
IN THIS THURSDAY'S ELECTIONS 
LONDONERS ARE NOT JUST CHOOSING A 
MAYOR BUT ALSO ELECTED THE TWENTY FIVE 
MEMBERS OF THE LONDON ASSEMBLY 
IT'S A COMPLEX VOTING SYSTEM WHICH 
AIMS TO GAIN A WIDE REPRESENTATION 
OF WHAT LONDONERS WANT BUT DO WE 
ALL KNOW HOW IT WORKS WE HAVE 
ASKED KARL MERCY HE TO EXPLAIN 
THEY WANT THEIR MERCYERS TO 
EXPLAIN THEY WANT YOUR VOTES THE 
PEOPLE BEHIND THE BLOW UPS WANT 
YOUR MONEY BUT VOTING FOR THE 
LONDON ASSEMBLY MEANS YOU MIGHT ARE 
TO PAY ATTENTION DOES THE MAN 
BEHIND TODAY'S STUNT KNOW WHAT TO 
DO 
I HAVEN'T A CLUE DO YOU GET DO THREE OR FOUR VOTES ARE YOU VOTING 
FOR FIVE CANDIDATES 
NONE OF THE 
ABOVE 
LONDONERS FACE THREE BALLOT ABOVE FORMS ON THURSDAY ONE YELLOW ONE 
PINK AND ONE PEACH WHEN YOU GO 
INTO THE POLLING BOOTH ON THURSDAY 
THIS IS THE FORM YOU WILL BE USING 
TO SELECT YOUR KAGED DAT FOR MAYOR 
ON FRIDAY CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR ON 
FRIDAY THE WINNER WILL BE STANDING 
HERE ON THE STAGE TO GET THERE 
LONDONERS WILL HAVE TO MARK A CROSS 
IN THE BOX FOR THEIR FIRST CHOICE 
CANDIDATE IF THEY WANT THEY CAN 
SELECT A SECOND CHOICE FOR MAYOR 
IF YOU MARK TWO FOR THE SAME 
CANDIDATE ONLY ONE WILL COUNT YOU 
ALSO GET A VOTE ON THE YELLOW FORM 
HERE YOU PUT AN X. IN THE BOX NEXT 
TO THE PERSON YOU WANT TO REPRESENT 
YOU ON THE LONDON ASSEMBLY FROM THE 
AREA WHERE YOU LIVE THE PEACH PAL 
LOT IS CRUCIAL FOR THE SMALLER 
PARTIES IT HAS ON IT JUST THE 
NAMES OF PARTIES NO INDIVIDUALS 
HERE YOU VOTE FORETHE PARTY YOU 
WANT TO REPRESENT YOU ON A LONDON 
WIDE BASIS 
BECAUSE IT'S A 
DIFFERENT SYSTEM I THINK MORE 
SHOULD BE EXPLAINED TO PEOPLE I I THINK YOU VOTE FOR YOUR FIRST 
CHOICE MAYOR YOU CAN HAVE YOU A 
SECOND CHOICE THEN YOU HAVE YOUR 
LOCAL CANDIDATE AND THAT'S WHERE IT 
GETS FOGGY 
IT STRIKES ME AS THOUGH 
IT WOULD BE CONFUSING I THINK 
PERHAPS EVEN IF YOU HAVE READ ON 
THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE HELP HELP WILL BE AT HAND AT POLLING STATIONS 
NOTHING BEING LEFT LEFT TO CHANCE 
EVERY VOTER HAS RECEIVED BOOKLET 
ON HOW TO VOTE WE HAVE POPS UPS 
AND POSTERS AND OBVIOUSLY THERE IS 
PEOPLE IN THE POLLING STAYSS WHO 
ARE TRAINED IF ANYONE HAS 
QUESTIONS JUST ASK 
THE HOPE THIS 
TIME IS WHOEVER WINS CAN RELY ON 
THE FACT EVERYONE HAS PUT THEIR X. 
WHERE THEY WANTED IT 
A RECENT OPINION POLL SUGGESTED 
SUPPORT FOR KEN LIVINGSTONE AND 
BORIS JOHNSON MAY BE SPLIT ALONG 
RACIAL LINES WITH THOSE FROM 
ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS FAR MORE 
LIKELY TO SUPPORT THE CURRENT MAYOR 
BUT WITH LONDONERS MORE DIVERSE 
THAN EVER JUST HOW BIG AN 
INFLUENCE WILL DIFFERENT 
COMMUNITIES PLAY 
KURT BARLING REPORTS 
HEADLINES EARLY ON IN HIS ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN ABOUT THE MAYOR'S RACE 
ADVISER MAY HAVE CREATED AN 
IMPRESSION THAT RACISM WOULD BECOME 
A MAJOR ELECTION ISSUE 
LONDON'S POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IS 
SHOWING SIGNS OF REAL CHANGE THOUGH 
NEW AND MORE ESTABLISHED MIGRANT 
COMMUNITIES ARE BECOMING MORE 
INVOLVED IN THE NITTY GRITTY ISSUES 
AND POLITICAL LIFE OF LONDON 
AT THE KURDISH NEW YEAR 
CELEBRATIONS IN MARCH ALL THREE 
MAIN CANDIDATES ONE AFTER THE 
OTHER GAVE THEIR PITCH TO THE 
ASSEMBLED THOUSANDS 
THERE IS NO MORE SUPPORT FOR A 
CERTAIN PARTY THOSE PARTIES MUST 
WORK HARDER THAN EVER TO GET THE 
VOTE AND TO GET INTO THE COMMUNITY 
AND TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT THEY NEED 
TO ADDRESS ISSUES AFFECTING THE 
KURDISH COMMUNITIES IN LONDON 
IN THIS NEW REALITY BEING A 
MINORITY IS NOT A SKIN COLOUR ISSUE 
MORE THAN HALF A MILLION REGISTERED 
VOTERS IN LONDON ARE EUROPEAN UNION 
NATIONALS AROUND TEN PER CENT OF THE 
ELECTORATE MANY OF THEM POLISH 
MIGRANTS WHO HAVE ARRIVED IN THE 
PAST FIVE YEARS AGAIN THE 
PRINCIPAL CANDIDATES HAVE MADE IT 
THEIR BUSINESS TO CANVASS AT EVENTS 
ORGANISED BY THESE GROUPS 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE 
COME HERE AND NOT ONLY FEEL AS 
MIGRANTS BUT ARE CITIZENS OF THE 
LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE BEST FEELING 
IS TO GIVE THEM THE POWER OF 
IMPOWERMENT BY CONVINCING THEM TO 
VOTE 
MY EXPECTATIONS ARE THE SAME VOTE AS LONDONERS L. WANT TO LIVE IN A 
BETTER CITY L. WANT A BETTER 
TRANSPORT SYSTEM BETTER SECURITY 
I'M A LONDONER NOW 
THIS IS VERY CLOSE ECTION AND 
COMMUNITY POLITICS SEEMS TO HAVE 
SHIFTED FROM A FOCUS ON RACE TO A 
FOCUS ON THE PRACTICAL ISSUES 
AFFECTING LONDON'S MINORITIES 
I'D LIKE A MAYOR WHO WORKS FOR 
LONDON WHO GIVES HIS BEST FOR 
LONDON LONDON ISSUES OF TRANSPORT HOUSING 
A SENSE OF LEADERSHIP AND DIRECTION 
IS TAKEN FROM PEOPLE FROM POWER 
YOU NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE IN OFFICE 
WHO CAN RUN THE OFFICE WITH TOTAL 
TRANSPARENCY TRANSPARENCY GUN CRIME IT NEEDS TO GO DOWN 
KNIFE CRIME NEEDS TO GO DOWN 
SECONDLY THE ELEMENT OF COMMUNITY 
AND FAMILY I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE 
REINSTATED IN THE COMMUNITY 
SINCE THE LAST LONDON ELECTIONS 
ONE MINORITY THAT HAS FACED MORE 
SCRUTINY THAN ANY OTHER HAS BEEN 
THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY FROM WITHIN 
THAT COMMUNITY YOUNG MUSLIMS ARE 
BEING URGED TO ENGAGE WITH THE 
SYSTEM SYSTEM WE REALISE THAT LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
NOT EVEN REGISTERED WHICH IS REAL 
SHAME FOR PEOPLE TO BE COMPLAINING 
ABOUT ISSUES THAT AFFECT THEM AND 
NOT EVEN TAKE THE STEP OF 
REGISTERING OR VOTING SO REALLY 
WHAT WE WERE TRYING DO IS GET 
PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT WHY THESE 
ELECTIONS MATTER TO THEM AND WHY 
THEY SHOULD GET INVOLVED THERE'S 
NO POINT IN COMPLAINING IF YOU 
DON'T MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD IN IN THIS ELECTION CANDIDATES HAVE 
FACED A CHANGED POLITICAL LANDSCAPE 
ACROSS THE CAPITAL THEY'VE HAD TO 
WORK HARD TO SEEK THE ATTENTION OF 
COMMUNITIES AND EVEN HARDER TO EARN 
THEIR VOTE 
PERHAPS SHOWING THAT LONDON HAS 
FINALLY BECOME THAT WORLD CITY 
PEOPLE SO OFTEN TALK ABOUT MORE DETAILS ARE ON OUR WEBSITE 
IN JUST OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS CHELSEA 
COULD BE ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR 
FIRST EVER CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 
THEY FACE LIVERPOOL AT STAMFORD 
BRIDGE TOMORROW 
BUT THE MATCH IS BEING OVERSHADOWED 
BY SATURDAY'S EVENTS WITH THE 
CLUB'S GROUNDS STAFF SCUFFLED WITH 
SEVERAL MANCHESTER UNITED PLAYERS 
GERAINT HUGHES IS THERE TONIGHT 
WHAT HAVE CHELSEA BEEN SAYING ABOUT 
THAT THAT RIZ THE MANCHESTER UNITED MANAGER 
SIR ALEX FERGUSON HAS ENJOYED 
MOCKING CHELSEA SAYING WHY DID 
THEY MOW THE LAWN AFTER THE GAME 
AND NOT DO IT BEFORE HAND HE IS 
ALSO SAYING HE IS DELIGHTED TO BE 
HANDING IN HIS REPORT TO THE 
FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION ABOUT THAT 
SCUFFLE BETWEEN SOME HIS PLAYERS 
AND THE CHELSEA GROUNDS STAFF SO 
WHAT HAVE CHELSEA DONE THEY CLOSED 
RANKS THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID 
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON 
FIRST I'M VERY HAPPY THAT MY 
PLAYERS WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THIS 
IT WAS THE PLAYERS FROM THE OTHER 
TEAM IT'S A CLUB ISSUE L. CANNOT 
ANSWER ABOUT THIS 
WHAT PUNISHMENT COULD THE F. A. HAND 
OUT GUERRE 
RIZ I CAN TELL YOU 
WHAT WILL NOT HAPPEN NEITHER SIDE 
WILL HAVE POINTS DEDUCTED TWO 
MATCHES LEFT AND THE RACE FOR THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE GOING TO THE 
WIRE THE FOOT AND MOUTH WON'T GET 
INVOLVED IN THAT A FINE IS 
EXPECTED AT WORST 
WHAT ABOUT 
TOMORROW'S MATCH AGAINST LIVERPOOL 
IS IT ADVANTAGE CHELSEA 
I THINK SO 
THE AWAY GOAL IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL 
THEY'VE GOT THIS AWAY GOAL COMING 
BACK TO STAMFORD BRIDGE CHELSEA 
HAVE THE GREATER MOMENTUM AND 
PERHAPS GREATER DESIRE REMEMBER 
THEY'VE LOST TO LIVERPOOL TWICE IN 
THE LAST THREE YEARS AT THE 
SEMIFINAL STAGE OF THE CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE AVRAM GRANT WANTS TO BE 
TAKING CHELSEA TO THE FINAL IN 
MOSCOW NEXT MONTH 
I WILL BE HAPPY TO DO THAT 
THE DREAM OF EVERYBODY IS THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
THIS IS THE TOP OF COURSE WE DID 
IT THE LONG LONG WAY AND NOT THE 
EASY WAY EVEN FOR ME ESPECIALLY 
THE SO TARGET IS THE CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE FOR SURE 
GUERRE EVEN IF CHELSEA WINS THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE OR THE CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE HOW SECURE IS AVRAM GRANT'S 
POSITION POSITION I THINK IT'S AN OPEN SECRET IT'S 
SOMETHING I FEEL SAD FOR HIM AS 
WELL AVRAM GRANT WILL PROBABLY NOT 
BE THE MANAGER OF CHELSEA NEXT 
SEASON I'VE BEEN HEARING ONE NAME 
WHISPERED AROUND CHELSEA OVER THE 
LAST WEEK SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON 
HE WAS NOT TAKING CHARGE OF 
MANCHESTER CITY NEXT SEASON WE 
UNDERSTAND CHELSEA TALKED TO SVEN 
GORAN ERIKSSON BEFORE THEY GAVE THE 
JOB TO JOSE MOURINHO HE'S A BIG 
NAME A GLAMOROUS NAME THAT FITS 
INTO CHELSEA'S IMAGE
