THIS PROGRMAME CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE 
GOOD CHOIRMASTER GARETH MALONE BELIEVES THAT SINGING IS GOOD FOR YOU 
KEEP THE ENERGY UP IT'S ABOUT OPENING YOUR WHOLE SELF UP EMOTIONALLY AND EXPRESSIVELY 
SINGING CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND ULTIMATELY CHANGE LIVES 
THESE SCHOOLBOYS DISAGREE 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH BOYS' CHOIRS THEY'RE GAY THEY'RE GAY 
SINGING IS GAY 
SO GARETH HAS GIVEN HIMSELF NINE MONTHS AT THEIR SCHOOL TO CREATE A ONE HUNDRED STRONG BOYS' CHOIR 
LOOK AT THIS SECTION LOOK AT THAT SECTION 
THEY'RE RUNNING AWAY I COULD SCREAM 
BIT BY BIT GARETH'S CHOIR HAS COME TOGETHER THAT'S MORE LIKE IT 
HE'S EVEN GOT THE PLAYGROUND RAPPERS AND THE STAFF SINGING 
HIS FINAL CHALLENGE IS TO PULL OFF A PERFORMANCE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
I'M LOST FOR WORDS TERRIFIED 
AND LEAVE THE SCHOOL A CULTURE OF SINGING THAT IT CAN CARRY INTO THE FUTURE 
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF AUTUMN TERM AT LANCASTER BOYS SCHOOL IN LEICESTER 
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE THING ON EVERYBODY'S MIND DON'T START TALKING SSH 
O. K. QUIET PLEASE CAN I JUST REMIND YOU IT'S NOW ABOUT FOUR WEEKS TO THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
WE NEED TO BE GOOD IN FOUR WEEKS 
BUT WITH THE BIG PERFORMANCE LOOMING LARGE THE CHOIR'S CLASSICAL PIECE OMBRA MAI FU 
IS HARDLY HITTING THE HEIGHTS 
DI VEGETABILE 
CARE ED AMABILE 
I HESITATE TO SAY I FEEL BRILLIANT WE'RE REALLY CLOSE TO THE WIRE 
IT'S STILL CHALLENGING FOR THEM TO DO IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF SUSTAINED SINGING 
THEY NEED A SORT OF POISE THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALISE THEY CAN BRING TO IT YET 
SOAVE PIU DON'T LOSE CONCENTRATION NOW 
DON'T LOSE CONCENTRATION DON'T LOSE CONCENTRATION 
APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE WE ACCEPT IT WE SMILE GRACIOUSLY 
AND WE DON'T START TALKING 
BEFORE THE ALBERT HALL I THINK WE NEED TO WORK ON WHERE WE COME IN 
ESPECIALLY ON OMBRA MAI FU 
WE'RE READY AS A CHOIR BUT WE NEED TO TAKE OUR ROLES MORE SERIOUS IN WHAT WE'RE DOING 
IF WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT WE CAN DO ANYTHING BUT WE NEED TO BRUSH UP 
IN SEARCH OF SOME PERFORMANCE INSPIRATION GARETH BEINGS THEM TO CAMBRIDGE FOR A CHORAL MASTERCLASS 
A REHEARSAL WITH KING'S COLLEGE CHOIR ONE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST AND MOST ACCOMPLISHED BOYS' CHOIRS 
I'M HOPING TODAY IS REALLY GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT THEY SING FOREVER 
THEY'LL GET THE EXPERIENCE OF SINGING IN THIS WONDERFUL BUILDING 
AND THEY'LL HEAR SOME OF THE BEST SINGING IN THE COUNTRY IT'S GOING TO BE VERY INSPIRING 
I'M HOPING THIS IS THE FIRST AND LAST STAGING POST 
BEFORE WE GO TO THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL TO BRING THEM UP TO THAT 
MORNING 
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WAIT ON THAT PONTOON 
BEFORE THE REHEARSAL THERE'S TIME TO SOAK UP THE SURROUNDINGS 
CUT IT OUT SERIOUSLY 
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE SINGING CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING A. 
WHO'S SENSIBLE 
HELLO 
I JUST GOT SOAKED 
GUYS JUST KEEP A LITTLE DECORUM 
I NEED TIES DONE UP LIKE MINE 
AND SHIRTS TUCKED IN 
I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED MATTHEW THAT WE DIDN'T LOSE YOU IN THE RIVER 
O. K. PLEASE DON'T DESTROY YOUR MUSIC KEEP IT NICE AND TIDY 
RESPECTFUL GENTLEMEN THANK YOU 
KING HENRY THE SIXTH FOUNDED KING'S CHOIR IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY ONE 
THE CEREMONIAL ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNGER CHORISTERS HAS HARDLY CHANGED SINCE 
GARETH HOPES THAT REHEARSING IN THE VAST COLLEGE CHAPEL WILL HELP PREPARE THE BOYS 
FOR THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
FIRST A CHANCE TO HEAR KING'S CHOIR PERFORM 
GENTLEMEN CAN THE LOWER VOICE CHOIR JOIN IN WITH THE TENORS AND BASSES REALLY WE'RE MOSTLY BARITONES 
NOW IT'S THE LANCASTER BOYS' TURN TO REHEARSE THEIR CLASSICAL PIECE 
SAY HELLO HELLO 
WHEN YOU COME FROM QUITE A HIGH NOTE AND YOU GO DOWN 
TRY NOT TO GO DOWN TOO FAR 
OMBRA MAI FU SHALL WE JUST HEAR THE TREBLES 
TWO THREE 
OMBRA MAI FU YES THAT'S BETTER 
NOW THE OLDER GENTLEMEN THE TENORS AND BASSES 
AS IF YOU'RE STROKING THE NOTE MORE 
CAN WE TRY YOUR ENTRY

SOAVE PIU 
GOOD THANK YOU EVERYBODY YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT EXTREMELY WELL ALREADY 
I THINK IT BOOSTED OUR CONFIDENCE DON'T YOU YEAH 
OUR SINGING HAS IMPROVED 
AND GENERALLY WE JUST HAD A REALLY GREAT FUN DAY TODAY 
IT WAS VERY VERY GOOD THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE I WAS SHOCKED AT HOW GOOD THEY WERE 
BRILLIANT I WISH I HAD A CAMERA SOME OF THE THINGS IN THERE WOW 
BUT YEAH IT WAS REALLY FUN SINGING WITH THEM 
AND GAVE EVERYONE A BIT OF A BOOST 
I NEVER THOUGHT WHEN I BECAME HEAD TEACHER AT THE LANCASTER SCHOOL 
THAT NINETY BOYS WOULD COME DOWN AND PERFORM WITH KING'S CHOIR 
THEY'VE DONE THEMSELVES PROUD I'M VERY PROUD 
WITH JUST THREE WEEKS TO GO THE CHOIR NEED A POPULAR SONG AS WELL AS THEIR CLASSICAL PIECE 
GARETH WANTS SOMETHING THAT INVOLVES HIS OTHER SINGING SUCCESSES 
THE PLAYGROUND RAPPERS AND THE STAFF 
I'D LIKE TO DO AN ARRANGEMENT WHERE EVERY SINGLE SINGING ELEMENT IN THE SCHOOL 
THE STAFF CHOIR BEATBOX CHOIR AND MAIN CHOIR ALL SING DIFFERENT BITS' 
IT NEEDS TO BE A SONG THAT BRINGS EVERYONE TOGETHER AND HAS THE RIGHT SORT OF SPIRIT 
I'VE COME UP WITH STAND BY ME BY BEN E. KING IT'S GOT THE RIGHT MOOD 
IT CAN HAVE EXACTLY THE EFFECT THAT I WANTED OF EVERYONE COMING TOGETHER AND BEING UNITED AS ONE 
AND BEING THE LANCASTER SCHOOL CHOIR 
O. K. VIRAJ CAN YOU SIT THERE CAN YOU SIT THERE 
O. K. 
GARETH'S AMBITIOUS ARRANGEMENT HINGES AROUND ONE VITAL PART 
I DO HAVE AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT WE ARE GOING TO DO STAND BY ME 
IT REQUIRES SOMEONE WITH NERVES OF STEEL TO DO IT 
AS A SOLO IN THE ALBERT HALL NOW 
YOU NEED TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT THAT 
THERE'S GOING TO BE LOTS OF PEOPLE 
JACK KENNA'S ALREADY STARTED TO CRY AT THE THOUGHT 
HE'S REALLY GOOD IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THINK IF YOU WANT TO DO IT 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOMEONE WHO'S DONE A SOLO BEFORE THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT THAT 
IT'S GOING TO BE LOTS OF PEOPLE 
NINE MONTHS AGO LANCASTER'S SONG SHY BOYS WOULD HAVE RUN A MILE 
BUT COME AUDITION DAY TWENTY FIVE BRAVE SOULS HAVE PUT THEMSELVES FORWARD 
OOH STAND BY ME 
OOH STAND 
GARETH'S RECRUITED HEAD OF MUSIC HELEN COLLINS AND PAUL CRAVEN TO HELP 
I WANT IT TO FEEL LIKE A REAL EVENT SO IT'S A BIG DEAL A BIG AUDITION 
I'VE GOT THE SCHOOL HALL A BIG DESK MR. CRAVEN COMING IN AND HELEN AS WELL 
IT'S A REAL TEAM EFFORT I WANT TO FRIGHTEN THEM A LITTLE 
THEY'LL BE REALLY SCARED AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
IF THEY CAN'T HANDLE THIS THEY WON'T HANDLE A BIG SOLO IN LONDON 
I'M NERVOUS

WHEN THE NIGHT HAS COME 
AND THE LAND IS DARK 
AND THE MOON IS THE ONLY LIGHT WE SEE 
THAT SAYS TO ME HE'S A BIT TOO NERVOUS FOR THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
I THINK HE'D CRACK UNDER THE PRESSURE 
IT'S NOT THE MOST AUSPICIOUS OF STARTS 
UNTIL TOJAN THOMAS BROWN

NO I WON'T BE AFRAID 
JUST AS LONG AS YOU STAND STAND BY ME 
BRILLIANT THANK YOU THAT WAS THE BEST FANTASTIC YEAH 
WE DO HAVE ALL THESE GUYS TO LISTEN TO YET BUT SO FAR THAT WAS OUR BEST ONE YEAH

LOVELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL DONE THANKS 
THE BOY WHO IS CHOSEN WILL BE LEADING THE CHOIR IN FRONT OF FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE 
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT WE NEED TO BE BRAVE AND DECIDE O. K. 
GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLEMEN COME AND TALK TO ME HERE PLEASE 
FIRST THINGS FIRST 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A RESERVE IT'S JUST YOU KNOW BELT AND BRACES 
THE PERSON WHO IS GOING TO BE THE STANDBY IS TOJAN 
REALLY WELL DESERVED 
THE PERSON WE'VE CHOSEN WAS A SURPRISE TO US WE WEREN'T EXPECTING THIS PERSON TO TURN OUT 
SUCH A FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE BUT ALSO THE SONG SUITS THE VOICE 
AND THAT'S WAHCHI 
WAHCHI VERY VERY VERY WELL DONE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
JUST WOW I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS THAT GOOD TO BE SOLO 
AND TO SING AT THE ALBERT HALL I THOUGHT TOJAN WAS THE BEST 
I'M JUST SURPRISED 
I HAVE TO PRACTISE REALLY HARD 
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A SOLOIST I STILL HAVE TO PRACTISE HARD JUST IN CASE 
WAHCHI WASTES NO TIME IN SPREADING THE GOOD NEWS 
I HOPE WAHCHI'S SINGING GET BETTER BETTER 
WE'RE SO VERY HAPPY 
HIS FAMILY HAVE BEEN AWARE OF HIS TALENT FOR YEARS 
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIVE OR SIX AND WE HAD A PARTY 
MY SISTER WANTED TO SING BUT I JUST PUSHED HER BACK AND JUST BOSSED HER AROUND 
WAHCHI'S CHINESE FAMILY SETTLED IN VIETNAM BEFORE FLEEING THE WAR IN POVERTY 
MY PARENTS USED TO TELL ME STORIES ABOUT THEIR LIFE 
SO TO JUST LIFT THEIR SPIRITS UP THEY ALL GET TOGETHER AND SING 
THEY'VE MADE ME WHAT I AM TODAY NOT JUST TO SING WITH A VOICE 
BUT TO SING WITH HEART SOUL AND VOICE 
WHEN THE NIGHT HAS COME 
AND THE LAND IS DARK 
LED BY THEIR NEW SOLOIST THE ONE HUNDRED STRONG LANCASTER CHOIR ARE MAKING PROGRESS 
NO I WON'T BE AFRAID 
DARLING DARLING STAND BY ME AND GARETH HAS ALSO ARRANGED A PART FOR THE STAFF 
STAND BY ME OH STAND 
BUT THERE ARE MORE BOYS THAT HE WANTS TO INVOLVE 
O. K. EVERYONE LET'S GO 
THE SCHOOL'S RAPPERS WERE ONCE TOTALLY AGAINST GARETH 
BUT HE WON THEIR RESPECT BY COMBINING CHORAL TECHNIQUES WITH THEIR OWN BRAND OF MUSIC 
THEY CALL THEMSELVES URBAN SOUNDS NOW HE WANTS THEM IN HIS CHOIR 
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO THIS WEEK IS TALK ABOUT ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
WHAT I HAVE DONE IS I'VE LEFT SIXTEEN BARS THAT HAVE PRETTY MUCH NOTHING IN IT 
HOW LONG IS THAT ABOUT FORTY SECONDS 
I WOULD REALLY LIKE YOU GUYS TO COME OUT AND DO SOMETHING FANTASTIC 
OVER THAT LITTLE BIT 
GARETH'S CHOSEN A PIECE OF MUSIC TO MIX INTO STAND BY ME 
JUST SING BEAUTIFUL GIRL ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
BEAUTIFUL GIRL 
KNEW IT COULD NEVER WORK 
YOU HAD ME SUICIDAL SUICIDAL 
WHEN YOU SAY IT'S OVER GOOD DO IT AGAIN 
THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS TO GO BADLY BADLY WRONG IS HUGE 
BUT WHEN THEY GET GOING THEY'RE FANTASTIC 
IT COULD REALLY MAKE IT ALL WORK 
SO THAT'S SIXTEEN BARS THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TO GET WORKING BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE IT AMAZING 
IT'S A POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM EVERYONE 
BUT ONE BOY'S INVOLVEMENT IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE 
WHEN GARETH ARRIVED HE DISCOVERED ONE OF THE BEST VOICES IN SCHOOL BELONGED TO IMRAN SIDDIQ 
HOW COULD THIS BE YOU'RE NOT HERE WITH ME 
HE'S THE KIND OF KID THAT EVERYONE WILL BE TOTALLY BOWLED OVER BY THAT'S A WINNER 
BUT IMRAN WAS NO MODEL PUPIL IMRAN WAIT 
IMRAN 
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH GARETH SOON TURNED SOUR 
I'M NOT GOING TO CARRY ON IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HELP ME IN THE CLASSROOM SITUATION 
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT ANY MORE SINGING'S BORING I DON'T LIKE DOING IT SO WHY SHOULD I COME AND DO IT 
AAARGH FUCK SAKE 
SINCE GETTING INVOLVED WITH URBAN SOUNDS IMRAN'S RESISTANCE TO SINGING HAS SOFTENED 
AND HIS INDIVIDUAL LESSONS HAVE STARTED AGAIN 
HEY IMRAN 
AFTER EIGHT MONTHS OF DEALING WITH IMRAN'S TRUCULENCE 
GARETH FINALLY FEELS CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO ASK HIM FOR A BIG COMMITMENT TRY BEAUTIFUL GIRL 
YOU'RE WAY TOO THAT BIT LET'S GIVE IT A GO 
YOU'RE WAY TOO BEAUTIFUL GIRL 
THAT'S WHY IT'LL NEVER WORK 
YOU'D LEAVE ME SUICIDAL SUICIDAL 
WHEN YOU SAY IT'S OVER 
O. K. CAN I LAY MY CARDS ON THE TABLE 
WHAT I THINK IS THAT YOU SHOULD 
AS PART OF THE BEATBOX CHOIR 
I THINK YOU SHOULD DO THAT AND DO IT AS A SOLO 
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD DO THAT AT THE ALBERT HALL 
YEAH COS I CAN JUST KEEP WORKING ON IT AT HOME YEAH YEAH THAT'S A PLAN THEN RIGHT 
WE'RE NOW WORKING TOWARDS YOU DOING A SOLO AT THE ALBERT HALL THAT'S GREAT YEAH O. K. 
JUST WHAT WHAT JUST HAPPENED 
REALLY STRANGE 
I FEEL LIKE I DON'T QUITE KNOW WHETHER HE REALLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT HE'S JUST AGREED TO 
BUT I CAN'T GET OVER THE CHANGE 
YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS AGO I GOT SO MUCH GRIEF FROM IMRAN 
AND YET NOW HERE HE IS WANTING TO DO A SOLO 
SO THAT'S GREAT 
BEAUTIFUL GIRL 
THAT'S WHY IT'LL NEVER WORK 
YOU'D HAVE ME SUICIDAL SUICIDAL 
EIGHT MONTHS AGO I DIDN'T THINK I'D SING A SOLO 
I DIDN'T LIKE HIM 
YOU'RE WAY TOO BEAUTIFUL GIRL 
I'VE LEARNT NOT TO JUDGE PEOPLE I SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO OFFER AND DON'T JUDGE THEM 
AND DON'T BE AN IDIOT WHEN THEY TRY TO HELP YOU 
LIKE HOW I ACTED TO HIM OH I WAS STUPID MAN 
I'M ASHAMED TO SAY THAT WAS EVEN ME 
THE TIME HAS COME TO BRING THE ELEMENTS OF GARETH'S ONE HUNDRED FIFTY STRONG CHOIR TOGETHER 
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE CHAIRS REPRESENTS A BOY IN MY CHOIR 
AND STAFF IT'S THE FIRST REHEARSAL WHERE EVERYONE COMES TOGETHER 
IT'S REALLY EXCITING 
HELLO BOYS FROM THIS ROW 
A FEW MONTHS AGO MOST OF THESE CHOIRBOYS AND RAPPERS WOULD HARDLY SPEAK LET ALONE SING TOGETHER 
CAN I HAVE SOME QUIET PLEASE FIVE FOUR 
GENTLEMEN WE HAVE LOTS OF WORK TO DO FIRST OF ALL UPPER VOICE CHOIR 
LOWER VOICE CHOIR SAY HELLO TO THE BEATBOXES HELLO BEATBOXES 
THE BEATBOXES SAY HELLO TO THE UPPER VOICE AND LOWER VOICE CHOIRS 
THE STAFF CHOIR ARE WAITING TO COME IN SHALL WE INVITE THEM IN STAFF CHOIR IN YOU COME 
FROM NOW ON WE ARE THE LANCASTER SCHOOL CHOIR 
THIS IS THE LAST PUSH GENTLEMEN FOR THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL WE'VE COME A VERY LONG WAY TOGETHER 
IT'S GOING TO BE FANTASTIC GARETH IS NOW LOOKING FOR PERFORMANCE QUALITY 
THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL IS LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AWAY 
STAND BY ME OH STAND BY ME

YOU'RE WAY TOO BEAUTIFUL GIRL 
THAT'S WHY IT'LL NEVER WORK 
YOU'D HAVE ME SUICIDAL SUICIDAL 
WHEN YOU SAY IT'S OVER 
BEAUTIFUL GIRL 
YEAH 
GOOD FUN IT SOUNDS POWERFUL 
IT'S REALLY GOOD HAVING ALL THE BOYS TOGETHER 
THEY ALL MIX UP AND MAKE IT ONE REALLY GOOD SONG 
IT WAS ALIVE 
ENERGY EVERYONE WAS GETTING INTO IT IT WAS NICE NICE 
IT WAS GOOD MAN IT WAS BETTER THAN NICE 
I CAN REALLY SEE US GOING TO THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL AND PERFORMING 
JUST A FEW REHEARSALS REMAIN BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE AND GARETH NEEDS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT ATTENDANCE 
BUT MAKING EVERY PRACTICE ISN'T EASY FOR THIRTEEN YEAR OLD CAMERON ELLIOT 
ON WEDNESDAY MORNING I CAN'T MAKE IT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT A BIT LATE YEAH 
CAMERON HAS HODGKIN'S DISEASE A FORM OF CANCER SINGING IS ONE OF THE FEW ACTIVITIES HE CAN JOIN IN 
DO YOU MIND ME ASKING ABOUT IT YOU LOOK QUITE WELL ARE YOU

CAMERON'S LONG TERM PROGNOSIS IS UNCERTAIN COME BACK HERE 
BEING PART OF THE CHOIR IS QUITE AN IMPORTANT THING TO CAMERON

OR SOME KIND OF NORMALITY FOR HIM IN HIS LIFE 
NO NO NO 
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS I CAN'T DO AT SCHOOL 
I CAN'T DO SPORTS FOOTBALL CRICKET BASKETBALL 
THEY'RE REALLY ACTIVE BUT I CAN DO THE CHOIR 
THANKS 
WHEN YOU'RE IN THERE YOU'RE SO INTERESTED IN SINGING AND MAKING IT PERFECT 
THAT YOU JUST FORGET ABOUT YOUR WORRIES' 
COULD YOU SAVE ME SOME OF THEM CAKES NO 
NOT MANY PARENTS GET TO SEE THEIR CHILDREN SINGING AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL IN LONDON

THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL ISN'T GARETH'S ONLY PRESSING CONCERN 
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SCHOOL WILL SUPPORT HIS CHOIR FOR YEARS TO COME 
HELLO HI COME IN I'M GARETH 
AT THE LAST GOVERNORS' MEETING BEFORE HE LEAVES HE WANTS THEM TO AGREE TO A SCHOOL CHORAL INSTRUCTOR 
AND EXTRA FINANCE TO HELP HELEN COLLINS KEEP THE CHOIR THRIVING 
GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS FOR COMING 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT START TO HEAR SOME TESTIMONIALS FROM THE BOYS 
ABOUT WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED SO JACK KENNA WILL SPEAK FIRST 
I WANTED TO SING AT THE SCHOOL BUT I WAS TOO SCARED I THOUGHT I'D GET BULLIED THEN MR. MALONE CAME 
ENCOURAGING US BOYS TO SING I REALLY WANTED TO GO INTO THE CHOIR SO I JUST WENT FOR IT 
THE CHOIR HAS PROVIDED A RARE OPPORTUNITY AND A SENSE OF TEAMWORK 
I'VE MADE FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE I NEVER WOULD HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE CHOIR'S EXTENDED THE SCHOOL SIGNIFICANTLY PROVING WE ARE ACCOMPLISHED SPORTSMAN AND SINGERS 
I STRUGGLE WITH SOME OF MY LESSONS AT SCHOOL BUT THIS HAS GIVEN ME A NEW INTEREST 
WITHOUT MR. MALONE AND THIS PROJECT I WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT ENTERING A CHOIR 
IT'S AMAZING WHAT MR. MALONE HAS DONE I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WOULD HAPPEN I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO MUCH 
BUT HE'S PULLED IT OFF AND WE'VE ALL COME TOGETHER AND WE'RE WORKING AS A TEAM 
WE'VE GONE TO AMAZING PLACES AND PUT ON GREAT SHOWS 
I'D JUST LIKE TO THANK HIM FOR COMING HERE IT WOULD BE GREAT IF MISS COLLINS COULD CARRY IT ON 
THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH GENTLEMEN 
I'M AFRAID I'M PUTTING THE BALL SQUARELY IN YOUR COURT

OH MY GOD THAT WENT REALLY WELL 
WELL DONE HELEN 
ALL THAT REMAINS IS FOR THE BOYS TO GIVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR LIVES AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BIGGEST THING I'VE EVER DONE 
I DO FEEL LIKE I'M THE ONE WHO IS PROVING SOMETHING I CAME HERE TO PROVE TO THE SCHOOL 
THAT SINGING WAS IMPORTANT AND I AM UP AGAINST IT 
THESE ARE NOT CHORISTERS THESE ARE JUST REGULAR KIDS IN A REGULAR SCHOOL 
IT'S A GOOD SCHOOL BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGING CULTURE 
WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT AS WE DO THEN IT REALLY MEANS SOMETHING 
COME IN CONFIDENTLY WITH THAT 
IN THE FINAL FEW DAYS THERE'S TUITION FOR HELEN SO THAT SHE CAN CONDUCT THE CLASSICAL PIECE 
PREPARE PREPARE LOOK AHEAD 
SOAVE PIU FINE THAT'S BETTER 
WHEN THE NIGHT HAS COME AFTER SPECIAL CARE AND ATTENTION 
STEROIDS WILL HELP 
JUST AS LONG AS YOU STAND STAND BY ME 
WE SHOULD SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT THAT'S MY FEELING

TONIGHT THERE WILL BE TWELVE PERFORMANCES IN ALL 
IN THIRTY MINUTES IT WILL BE THE TURN OF THE LANCASTER CHOIR

GOOD EVENING AND HELLO THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY CHOIR MASTERS REALLY STRUGGLE TO GET BOYS TO JOIN THE SCHOOL CHOIR 
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND I WENT IN APRIL TO LANCASTER SCHOOL IN LEICESTER 
IT'S A HUGE SCHOOL FULL OF SPORTING YOUNG MEN 
I WENT TO CONVINCE THEM THAT SINGING WAS SOMETHING THEY COULD EXCEL AT AND REALLY ENJOY 
AND IT COULD BE SOMETHING THEY COULD BE REALLY PROUD TO BE INVOLVED IN 
THIS IS I HOPE THE BEGINNING OF A SINGING ETHOS AND CULTURE 
THAT WILL LAST FOR MANY YEARS THERE 
TO THAT END I'M NOT GOING TO CONDUCT THE FIRST PIECE

WHOO 
WE DID IT 
GUYS 
O. K. GUYS 
I'M MASSIVELY PERSONALLY PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED TONIGHT 
YOU WERE FANTASTIC YOU REALLY WERE 
IT WAS AMAZING TO BE ONSTAGE WITH THEM 
IT WAS A FANTASTIC MOMENT AND SOMETHING I'M REALLY PROUD OF 
I'VE REALLY GROWN TO LOVE LOTS OF THOSE PEOPLE 
TO SEE THEM SING AND REALLY WANT TO SING WELL THAT MEANS SO MUCH 
REALLY INCREDIBLE 
IT WAS MAGNIFICENT BRILLIANT INSPIRING I WAS REALLY PROUD 
HIP HIP HOORAY 
HIP HIP HOORAY 
NOTHING THAT I'VE DONE SO FAR IN MY LIFE 
COULD BEAT THIS AND I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD 
I'M SHOCKED THAT WE PULLED IT OFF 
THERE WAS A FEELING THAT YOU BELONGED TO SOMETHING 
THAT WAS REALLY AMAZING I DID FEEL REALLY PROUD TO BE A PART OF THAT 
BASICALLY THEY'VE TOLD ME HOW THEY FEEL AND SAID I SUNG REALLY WELL I DON'T KNOW WHY I CRIED 
I NEVER USED TO CRY IT JUST MADE ME CRY I DON'T KNOW WHY 
JUST NATURAL TOO HAPPY 
IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR MY MUM TO BE THERE 
SO SHE COULD SEE HOW GOOD WE COULD SING 
AND THAT I'VE ACTUALLY ACHIEVED SOMETHING THAT I LIKE DOING 
IT WAS SO BRILLIANT TO SEE HIM 
DOING SOMETHING AS SPECIAL AS THIS 
IF IT WAS LEFT TO GOD'S HANDS HE SHOULD HAVE DIED WHEN HE WAS EIGHT EVERY DAY WITH HIM IS A BLESSING 
AND EVERY DAY I GET TO SEE HIM ACHIEVE DIFFERENT THINGS I'M REALLY PROUD 
OVER THE MOON ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT EVERYTHING IT'S JUST IT WAS WICKED MAN 
I'LL REMEMBER IT FOR A LONG TIME 
I WAS HAPPY WHEN I SAW HER AND SHE WAS SMILING AND EVERYTHING 
IF IT WAS TO PLEASE ANYONE I WAS HOPING I'D PLEASE HER THEN I WOULDN'T MIND ANYTHING 
REALLY YEAH 
OH

THERE ARE THINGS 
WAITING IN THE DARKNESS 
CREATURES OF METAL AND FIRE AND BLOOD 
BUT HE'S OUT THERE BURNING THROUGH TIME 
FACING A THOUSAND DANGERS ACROSS THE STARS AND NEVER GIVING UP 
HE LOOKS LIKE A MAN BUT HE'S A LEGEND AND HIS NAME 
IS THE DOCTOR 
HE'LL COME BACK TO SAVE US 
AND THIS TIME I'M GONNA BE READY 
THEN JUST LIKE THAT 
WE'LL BE GONE
