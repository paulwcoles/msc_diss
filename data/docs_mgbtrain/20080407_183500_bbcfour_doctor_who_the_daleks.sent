PERHAPS I AM TEMMOSUS BUT WHY SHOULD THE DALEKS HELP US 
YOU'VE BEEN SAYING THAT EVER SINCE THEIR MESSAGE ARRIVED 
PERHAPS THEIR OFFER WAS COLDLY WORDED BUT FRIENDSHIP GROWS WITH TIME 
THESE DALEKS MUST HAVE BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY SURVIVORS ON THIS PLANET 
ARE THEY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT THEY AREN'T 
OR ARE THEY SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED PERHAPS INSANELY JEALOUS 
YOU'VE NO REASON TO SAY THAT 
I THINK YOU MISJUDGE THEM 
WELL YES I'M BEING ILLOGICAL UNFAIR IF YOU LIKE BUT 
I JUST HAVE AN INSTINCT 
LISTEN WE MUST FIND A NEW SOURCE OF FOOD 
THE DALEKS HAVE IT THEY'VE OFFERED IT TO US 
THESE ARE FACTS ALYDON FACTS 
YES YES I KNOW BUT 
LET ME TALK TO THEM 
IT'S RIGHT THAT I SHOULD DO SO BUT SUPPOSING NO ALYDON 
AND YOU MUST THROW OFF THESE SUSPICIONS 
THEY'RE BASED ON FEAR AND FEAR BREEDS HATRED 
AND WAR 
I SHALL SPEAK TO THEM PEACEFULLY 
THEY'LL SEE THAT I'M UNARMED 
THERE IS NO BETTER ARGUMENT AGAINST WAR THAN THAT 
YES IF THEY REALLY WANT TO LISTEN

WELL LET'S HEAD BACK TO THE SHIP NO NO I MUST WARN THE THALS SUSAN 
WE CAN'T LET THEM WALK INTO A TRAP THE THALS ARE NO CONCERN OF OURS 
WE CANNOT JEOPARDISE OUR LIVES IN AN AFFAIR WHICH IS NONE OF OUR BUSINESS

IF YOU CANNOT DECIDE NOW 
WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR CENTURIES WE SHALL GO ON WAITING 
TAKE THESE THINGS 
NO IT'S A TRAP GET OUT OF HERE RUN 
FIRE 
WHO ARE YOU I AM ALYDON 
YOU ARE THE MAN WHO WARNED US YES I'M SORRY I WAS LATE 
YES OUR LEADER TEMMOSUS IS DEAD 
I KNOW I SAW IT WHY WHY KILL HIM 
THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HIM WE CAN'T DISCUSS IT HERE 
GET YOURSELF AND YOUR MEN AWAY FROM HERE COME ON 
NO NOT YET 
FASCINATING ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING 
YOU KNOW THESE RECORDS MUST GO BACK NEARLY A HALF A MILLION YEARS 
THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF OUR PLANET SKARO IS HERE 
IT SEEMS NOW THAT NO ONE WILL SURVIVE TO READ IT 
OH NONSENSE YOUNG LADY 
WHAT ER IS THIS A SOLAR SYSTEM 
YES SKARO IS THE TWELFTH PLANET 
HERE I SEE AND THIS 
THIS WHAT IS THIS PLANET 
EACH OF THESE MAPS IS A TINY SECTION OF ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM SO A TOTAL PICTURE CAN BE BUILT UP 
TOTAL OH YOU HAVE RECORDS OF OTHER SYSTEMS YES 
WELL I. I SAY TOTAL 
OF COURSE WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO MAP OUT AS FAR AS OUR ELECTROSCOPES ALLOWED YES I SEE 
I WONDER IF I COULD SEE THE PLANS OH YES 
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIX OUR POSITION 
AH YES YES ABSORBING 
MOST ABSORBING YES 
GRANDFATHER SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING HIMSELF 
SOME OF THE CHILDREN HAVE HEARD SOMETHING MOVING IN THE FOREST 
THEY CAN'T BE THE DALEKS 
THEY TOLD US THEY COULDN'T COME OUT OF THE CITY 
NEVERTHELESS I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE ON OUR GUARD HERE THEY ARE 
ANTODUS HAS BEEN WOUNDED 
WE HAD TO GO ROUND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CITY 
IS HE BADLY HURT IT'S HIS SHOULDER 
I'LL GET SOME OINTMENT AND SOMETHING TO COVER THE BURNS WE'VE GOT SOME IN THE SHIP THERE'S SOME OVER HERE 
WE TRIED TO GO BACK FOR TEMMOSUS WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HIM 
IT WAS HOPELESS 
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THE DALEKS WERE HOLDING PRISONER 
AND THIS IS THE MAN WHO SHOUTED TO WARN US 
THANK YOU 
DID THE OTHERS GET AWAY ALYDON 
TACANDA WAS KILLED 
THE REST OF US ESCAPED 
THE BURNS DON'T SEEM TO BE TOO BAD 
I'LL GET SOME WATER FOR HIM TO DRINK CAN YOU MANAGE YES 
HAVE YOU DECIDED WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ALYDON 
YOU MUST TAKE THE PLACE OF TEMMOSUS NOW 
YES YES I KNOW 
IF ONLY I KNEW WHY THE DALEKS HATED US 
IF I KNEW THAT I. I COULD ALTER OUR APPROACH TO THEM PERHAPS 
YOUR LEADER TEMMOSUS YES 
WELL HE APPEALED VERY SENSIBLY TO THEM 
ANY REASONABLE HUMAN BEINGS WOULD HAVE RESPONDED TO HIM THE DALEKS DIDN'T 
THEY OBVIOUSLY THINK AND ACT AND FEEL IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WAY THEY JUST AREN'T HUMAN 
YES BUT WHY DESTROY WITHOUT ANY APPARENT THOUGHT OR REASON 
THAT'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND OH THERE'S A REASON 
EXPLANATION MIGHT BE BETTER 
IT'S STUPID AND RIDICULOUS BUT IT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT FITS WHAT 
A DISLIKE FOR THE UNLIKE 
BUT I DON'T FOLLOW YOU 
THEY'RE AFRAID OF YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE DIFFERENT FROM THEM 
SO WHATEVER YOU DO IT DOESN'T MATTER 
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO FIGHT AGAINST THEM I DIDN'T SAY THAT 
BUT YOU MUST TEACH THEM TO RESPECT YOU 
SHOW THEM SOME STRENGTH 
BUT YOU REALLY BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO FIGHT 
YES I THINK IT MAY HAVE TO COME TO THAT 
YOU UNDERSTAND AS LITTLE ABOUT US AS THE DALEKS DO 
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF THE DALEKS COULD LEAVE THEIR CITY IF THEY CAME UP HERE AND ATTACKED YOU 
WE WOULD GO AWAY BACK TO OUR PLATEAU WHERE WE CAME FROM 
YOU'D SIMPLY RUN AWAY 
ALYDON YOU CAN'T GO ON RUNNING AWAY 
THERE ARE SOME THINGS WORTH PRESERVING 
WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO DIE 
TEMMOSUS PROVED THAT 
I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT DYING 
LOOK YOU CAN'T HAND YOURSELVES OVER TO THE DALEKS 
SOONER OR LATER THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND DESTROY YOU IF THEY CAN 
I CAN SEE YOU WANT TO HELP US BUT AS DYONI SAYS YOU YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND 
THERE CAN NEVER BE ANY QUESTION OF THE THALS FIGHTING THE DALEKS 
COME GANATUS 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM 
THEY'RE NOT COWARDS THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE AFRAID 
CAN PACIFISM BECOME A HUMAN INSTINCT 
PACIFISM IS THAT IT 
PACIFISM ONLY WORKS WHEN EVERYBODY FEELS THE SAME 
YES BUT ARE THEY REALLY PACIFISTS 
I MEAN GENUINELY SO 
OR IS IT A BELIEF THAT'S BECOME A REALITY BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER HAD TO PROVE IT 
I SAY I SAY I THINK THESE WILL INTEREST YOU LOOK HERE 
THIS IS THESE PEOPLE'S ANCESTORS THE ORIGINAL THAL MALE 
THERE WAS A NEUTRON WAR HERE MOST DIED AND THE SURVIVORS MUTATED 
BUT IN THE CASE OF THE THALS MUTATION CAME ROUND IN FULL CIRCLE 
THEN REFINED ITSELF INTO WHAT YOU SEE 
YOU MEAN THIS BECAME 
YES YES IT TOOK HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF COURSE IN THE SECOND EXAMPLE 
OUR RECENT HOSTS THE MUTATION HAS NOT COMPLETED ITS FULL CIRCLE 
BUT DO YOU REMEMBER THAT MONSTROSITY WE TOOK OUT OF ITS MACHINE YES 
THIS IS ITS FOREBEAR 
THE ORIGINAL DALEK 
YES THEY CALLED THEM DALS THEN 
OH IT'S ALL THERE EVERY MOMENT OF SKAROENE HISTORY 
MINUTELY BUT BRILLIANTLY RECORDED 
PRICELESS ABSOLUTELY PRICELESS 
IS THIS A SWORD THE THAL'S HOLDING YES THEY WERE THE WARRIORS THEN 
WERE THEY UNDOUBTEDLY HEY ANTODUS IS FEELING MUCH BETTER 
OH I'M VERY GLAD TO HEAR HE'S IMPROVING 
I'M SURE YOU'LL ALL AGREE THAT IT'S TIME WE WENT BACK TO THE SHIP COME ALONG 
CAN'T WE STAY LONGER THE THALS ARE SUCH NICE PEOPLE 
AND THE DALEKS ARE NOT WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT MY CHILD 
I WONDER IF THERE'S ANY POINT IN REMINDING THE THALS OF WHAT THEY USED TO BE WHY 
OH THEY'RE OPPOSED TO FIGHTING 
WE WERE TRYING TO CONVINCE THEM THAT IT WAS A NECESSITY FOR SURVIVAL 
BUT OUR FATE DOESN'T REST WITH THE THALS SURELY 
LET'S LEAVE WELL ALONE WE HAVE OURSELVES TO WORRY ABOUT NOW COME ALONG 
MAYBE THE DOCTOR'S RIGHT 
YES LET'S GET IN THE SHIP AND GET AS FAR AWAY FROM HERE AS POSSIBLE 
OH PLEASE COME ALONG 
OH BY THE WAY LET ME HAVE THE FLUID LINK WILL YOU 
OH DEAR BOY NOW PLEASE PLEASE COME ALONG YOU KNOW I CAN'T START THE SHIP WITHOUT IT 
THE FLUID LINK YOU'VE LOST IT 
IAN YOU CAN'T HAVE 
NO 
THE DALEKS TOOK IT FROM ME WHEN THEY SEARCHED ME 
IT'S DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE 
IN THE CITY 
WE'RE IN POMPEII AND IT'S VOLCANO DAY 
YOU SAVE PEOPLE NOT THIS TIME 
SHOW YOURSELF I MUST MAKE THE MOST TERRIBLE CHOICE 
DONNA DOCTOR
