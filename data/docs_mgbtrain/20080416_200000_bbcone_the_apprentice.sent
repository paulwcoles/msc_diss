HELLO 
GOOD MORNING THIS IS FRANCES CALLING FROM SIR ALAN'S OFFICE 
HE WANTS YOU TO MEET HIM AT THE WALLACE COLLECTION IN CENTRAL LONDON 
PLEASE BE READY TO LEAVE THE HOUSE IN HALF AN HOUR'S TIME THANK YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BYE HOW LONG 
WERE LEAVING IN HALF AN HOUR 
MAYBE IT'S A COLLECTION OF CANAL BOATS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING 
THE ONLY WALLIS I KNOW IS CLOTHES 
THE WALLACE COLLECTION IS IN MARYLEBONE CENTRAL LONDON 
IT'S ONE OF THE CAPITAL'S MOST CELEBRATED GALLERIES 
GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SIR ALAN 
HERE WE ARE AT THE VERY FAMOUS WALLACE COLLECTION 
AND IN THIS PARTICULAR ROOM YOU CAN SEE SOME QUITE FAMOUS PORTRAITS 
THE TASK I'M GO TO SET YOU TODAY IS ALL ABOUT PORTRAITS 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO PAINT THEM BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY 
I HAVE FOUND YOU ONE OF THE BIGGEST SHOPPING CENTRES IN ENGLAND 
YOU'RE GOING TO PHOTOGRAPH CUSTOMERS 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SELL THEM THEIR PORTRAITS 
NOW I'VE BEEN MENTIONING TO YOU ON AND OFF IN THE PAST THREE WEEKS 
MY DISCOMFORT ABOUT RIFTS 
GANGS WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT WITHIN THE TEAMS I DON'T LIKE IT 
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR BUSINESS 
SO IT'S TIME TO MIX THE TEAMS UP 
JENNY SARA AND CLAIRE MOVE OVER THERE 
AND RAEF LEE AND KEVIN YOU GO OVER THERE 
THIS TASK IS SIMPLE 
THE TEAM THAT COMES BACK WITH THE MOST AMOUNT OF PROFIT WILL WIN 
AND THE TEAM THAT LOSES WITHIN THAT TEAM ONE OF YOU WILL BE FIRED 
O. K. EVERYTHING CLEAR 
GOOD GOOD LUCK 
OFF YOU GO 
TOMORROW THE TEAMS WILL HAVE TO SELL PHOTOGRAPHIC PORTRAITS TWENTY MILES AWAY 
AT THE BLUEWATER SHOPPING CENTRE 
AT BLUEWATER SHOPPERS ARE KNOWN AS GUESTS AND TWENTY SEVEN MILLION OF THEM 
VISIT THE COMPLEX EVERY YEAR 
THE TEAMS WILL HAVE TO SET UP STANDS THEN CHARM CUSTOMERS INTO POSING AND PAYING FOR PHOTOGRAPHS 
FIRST BOTH TEAMS NEED A PROJECT MANAGER 
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THIS MORNING I AM ABSOLUTELY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT UP FOR 
LEADING THIS AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF REVELATIONS AND REASONS WHY 
THAT I'LL GO THROUGH IN A MINUTE 
BUT IF EVERYBODY IS BEHIND ME ON THIS ONE IS EVERYBODY HAPPY 
FOR ME TO PROJECT MANAGE THIS TASK 
I'VE GOT AN I. Q. OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SO I CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE FAIRLY CLEVER 
THE ONLY THING IS I THINK PEOPLE DON'T LIKE A SMART ARSE 
I MIGHT HAVE TO BITE MY TONGUE A BIT IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THIS COMPETITION 
NOT TO OVERAWE THEM WITH INTELLIGENCE 
LET'S DRAW YOUR REASONS AS TO WHY YOU WANT TO BE PROJECT MANAGER 
O. K. MY BEST FRIEND IS A PHOTOGRAPHER AND CAMERAMAN 
I KNOW ABOUT SHUTTER SPEEDS 
I KNOW ABOUT SETTING UP A TRIPOD AND A CAMERA 
I KNOW ABOUT SINGLE LENS REFLEX CAMERAS I KNOW THE TERMINOLOGY 
I'M GONNA HAVE A HEAD START IN USING THE EQUIPMENT AND I KNOW THE AREA 
BLUEWATER IS MY AREA I KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT SHOP THERE AND WHAT THEY BUY 
THAT'S MY REASONS FOR WANTING TO LEAD THIS TASK THIS MORNING 
MY ONLY RESERVATION WOULD BE IN PRESSURISED SITUATIONS 
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP ONE HUNDRED PER CENT EYE ON THE GAME 
IF YOU FEEL YOU CAN DO THAT ALEX TO COME BACK ON THAT 
I'VE BEEN IN PRESSURISED SITUATIONS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AT THE SHARP END OF EVERY TASK WE'VE DONE SO FAR 
THIS WAY I CAN TAKE A STEP BACK 
YOU'LL SEE A CALMER MORE REFLECTIVE SIDE OF ME 
AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF YOUR RESERVATIONS ARE PROVED RIGHT 
AND I AM THE WRONG MAN IT'S GOING TO BE ME IN THE BOARDROOM WITH MY NUTS ON THE CHOPPER 
BUT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO US COS WE ALL WANT TO DO WELL AND WIN 
IF YOU'RE CONFIDENT THAT YOU CAN KEEP CALM AND DIRECT US 
I PROMISE 
ON THE OTHER TEAM ANOTHER VOLUNTEER 
THE PROJECT MANAGER WILL BE HELENE 
I'M A BUSINESS WOMAN WITH A LOT OF BALLS AND A LOT OF FRONT AND NOTHING FAZES ME 
IN THIS TASK WHAT IS VERY EVIDENT AT THE MINUTE IS I WANT 
STRONG SALES PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THE SHOPPING CENTRE 
WHAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF IN BUSINESS IS INCOMPETENCE OR PEOPLE PRETENDING 
THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHEN THEY DON'T 
TOMORROW BOTH TEAMS WILL NEED TWO GROUPS 
ONE TECHNICAL TO PROCESS THE PICTURES THE OTHER TO SELL 
I'M REALLY GOOD AT SALES 
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW DON'T HOLD BACK 
I DID THE BACK ROOM I WAS THE CHEF LAST TIME SO I WANT TO BE OUT THERE NAILING IT 
I'M GOING TO ASK RAEF AND LUCINDA IF THEY WILL GO IN THE BACK TEAM 
FOR TECHNOLOGY RAEF AND LUCINDA I CAN'T EVEN USE A MOBILE PHONE 
I'VE GOT A DIGITAL I MEAN I PRINT MY OWN DIGITAL PHOTOS 
I DON'T TAKE PHOTOS I'VE NEVER HAD A DIGITAL CAMERA 
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A CAMERA ON MY PHONE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT 
IF YOU THINK I'D BE APPROPRIATE 
ON THE OTHER TEAM PROJECT MANAGER SIMON PICKS ALEX 
CLAIRE AND JENNY AS TECHNICIANS AND DELEGATES RESPONSIBILITY 
BECAUSE I'VE WORKED WITH ALEX BEFORE ALEX WILL HEAD UP MY OTHER TEAM 
COS I'M GOING TO BE TAKING PHOTOS YOU'LL BE MY SECOND IN COMMAND ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT ROLE 
WHAT I'D SAY IS I KNOW THAT I'M PROBABLY I WOULD SAY THAT I AM THE STRONGEST HOWEVER 
LET ME FINISH I'M HAPPY DOING THAT BUT I'M NOT HAPPY 
HEADING UP YOUR TEAM IN THAT YOU'RE PASSING RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS ESSENTIALLY YOURS TO ME 
BUT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU WANT TO DELEGATE TO ME 
YOU'RE GOING TO RETAIN CONTROL OF THE OTHER TEAM FOR ME BUT YOU SAID YOU CAN MAKE DECISIONS FOR ME 
NOT WITHOUT RUNNING THEM PAST ME I'M MAKING THE DECISIONS ALL I WOULD SAY IS 
AND I'M NOT ADVISING YOU HOW TO DO IT DON'T DILUTE DOWN YOUR POSITION 
I'M NOT ABDICATING MY RESPONSIBILITY CLAIRE WOULD YOU BE HAPPIER TO BE MY LINK TO THE SECOND TEAM 
MY FIRST PORT OF CALL YEAH RIGHT 
ALEX YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK 
O. K. LET'S GO ON IT 
CAN I JUST MAKE SOME 
ALEX WAS EXTREMELY RELUCTANT TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY 
IN FACT HE SHIRKED MORE OR LESS EVERYTHING 
SIMON WAS MERELY TRYING TO MAKE HIM THE LINK FOR THAT HALF OF THE TEAM 
ALEX IS PLAYING A GAME HERE 
TODAY THE TEAMS HAVE TO CREATE A THEME FOR THEIR STANDS AND BUY PROPS 
PROJECT MANAGER SIMON GOES FOR A GLAMOUR AND BEAUTY THEME 
THE SHOPPING CENTRE IN KENT THE GRASS IS GREEN THE SKY IS BLUE 
AND THE WOMEN ARE ORANGE 
IT'S THE LAND OF THE ESSEX AND KENT BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE 
THE FAKE LOOK WAGS 
I WOULDN'T WANT TO DEGENERATE MY OWN TYPE OF PERSON THE KIND OF PERSON I'D DATE AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
SO IT'S LIKE FOOTBALLER'S WIVES BASICALLY ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON 
HOW DO WE THINK SIMON'S GONNA COPE OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS 
I'M GONNA STEP BACK A BIT COS I'VE WORKED WITH HIM A FEW TIMES I WANNA GET YOUR PERCEPTION 
YEAH I COMPARE HIM TO A TODDLER 
HE'S TRYING TO RUN AND HE'S VERY ENTHUSIASTIC AND WE'RE GIVING HIM THE REINS TO STAY UP 
WHILE SIMON'S TECHNICAL TEAM HEAD FOR TRAINING IN LUTON HE'S AT A HIRE COMPANY ON THE HUNT FOR PROPS 
ANYTHING THE TEAM SPENDS WILL BE DEDUCTED FROM THEIR EARNINGS TOMORROW 
RIGHT SO THIS KIND OF THING THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT 
SHE'D LOVE TO JUST SIT LIKE THAT ALL DRESSED UP 
WHAT I'M THINKING IS THIS KIND OF THING 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
THE THEME THAT WE DECIDED ON CREATIVELY ISN'T A THEME 
GLAMOUR BEAUTY 
IT'S JUST GENERIC MISCELLANEOUS 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN 
WE'RE HERE TO MAKE SOME MONEY 
WE CAN CHANGE THE LOOK OF THIS BY HOW WE PHOTOGRAPH IT 
WHETHER IT BE CLOSE UP PULL BACK THE CAMERA'LL ALLOW US TO DO THAT 
YOU GOTTA TRUST ME THAT I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WITH PHOTOGRAPHY 
BOTH TEAMS WILL BE ABLE TO PRINT PHOTOS ON TO ALMOST ANY PRODUCT 
AT A DIGITAL PRINTING COMPANY HELENE AND SOME OF HER TEAM CHECK OUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE 
THE OBVIOUS THINGS ARE MUGS VERY POPULAR 
THINGS LIKE JIGSAWS PLACE MATS 
IF THE HANDLE'S IN THE WRONG PLACE YOU'LL FORCE IT ROUND 
HELENE HAS PUT RAEF IN CHARGE OF TRANSFERRING PICTURES 
LUCINDA HAS THE JOB OF COMPUTER PROCESSING THE IMAGES 
I DON'T TAKE PHOTOS I'VE NEVER HAD A DIGITAL CAMERA I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT 
YOU'RE SOON GONNA FIND OUT 
ABSOLUTELY I'M GONNA BE GREAT AT IT AS WELL YOU WATCH ME LEARN 
YOU CAN PUT IT ON YOUR C. V. YEAH DIGITAL CAMERA EXPERT ABSOLUTELY 
DETERMINED TO DRAW BIG CROWDS HELENE'S INSTRUCTED THE OTHER HALF 
OF HER TEAM TO FIND A CELEBRITY LOOK ALIKE

AS CHERIE THERE'S A LOT OF 
WOMEN ARE MORE POPULAR WITH THE CHARACTER OF GEORGE 
GAY PEOPLE ARE QUITE POPULAR WITH GEORGE

SIMON I'M REALLY STRUGGLING TO FIND OUT WHO WANTS WHAT BECAUSE I'VE NO IDEA WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE 
WHAT I SAID TO CLAIRE IS YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE THE PICTURE THAT 
SIMON LET ME TALK 
THE PROBLEM IS THE NUMBER ON YOUR CAMERA DOESN'T CORRESPOND TO ANYTHING ON THE COMPUTER 
SO WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO IS KEEP A TALLY OF WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR MEMORY CARD 
PHOTO NUMBER ONE IS THE LADY PLUS BABY

IT'S JUST TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T GET ANY MISTAKES 
RIGHT LEAVE ME TO DO THIS ALL RIGHT 
WE'VE BEEN PROMISED OUR PHOTO BUT WE'VE NOT HAD IT 
SO AS SOON AS WE GET IT WE'LL GO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO GO OR TO STAY 
BECAUSE THE KIDS ARE GETTING A BIT FED UP NOW I JUST WANNA GET HOME 
IF THEY HAVE TO WAIT TOO LONG THEY MAY WELL JUST GO HOME ALL THEY'VE LOST IS THE PHOTO 
THEY HAVEN'T PAID IN ADVANCE SO THEY COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE MOST OF THE BUSINESS THEY'VE DONE ALREADY TODAY 
AND ITS TWELVE HUNDRED P. M. ALREADY 
PEAK TIME AT THE CENTRE 
HELENE'S LOOK ALIKE IS ATTRACTING BIG CROWDS 
COME ON THEN LET'S GO AND SEE BECKS 
BUT THE TECHNICAL TEAM IS AT A STANDSTILL 
WITH BUSINESS ANALYST LUCINDA UNABLE TO FATHOM THE COMPUTER THEY'VE RUSHED IN SOME HELP 
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S JUST WHERE HAVE THOSE ARROWS GONE 
A WEE BIT STRESSED I'M TRYING MY HARDEST TO WORK THINGS OUT 
I'VE MANAGED TO BURN A C. D. THIS MORNING I DON'T KNOW HOW 
I WAS ASKED HOW I COULD DO IT AGAIN TO REPEAT IT BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW I DID IT IT WAS JUST LUCKY 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THE COMPUTER NO I'M NOT BECAUSE AS I SAID 
NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY I'M NOT A TECHNICAL PERSON 
I'M NOT EITHER BUT I TOLD YOU THIS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE 
I KNOW YOU DID BUT WHAT DO I DO DON'T PUT YOU ON THINGS 
IT'S MY DECISION O. K. O. K. 
YOU WERE THERE FOR TRAINING AS WELL WHY AREN'T YOU COMFORTABLE WITH DOING THIS 
I'M PROJECT MANAGER AND I SAID THAT YOU'D BE DOING THIS 
LIKE WHEN I WAS ASSIGNED TO THE KITCHEN I COOKED FOR TEN HOURS IT'S ABOUT TEAMWORK 
IT'S ABOUT BEING ASSIGNED A ROLE I'M HAPPY DOING IT BUT YOU PUT PEOPLE IN THE APPROPRIATE SKILL SET 
OH FOR CHRIST'S SAKE LUCINDA SO WE'LL JUST MOVE IT ALL ROUND YOU 
LUCINDA IS POOR AT HER END OF THE JOB WHY IS THAT 
BECAUSE HELENE PUT HER IN THAT JOB 
AND THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE GIVING UP 
WE WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE NOW THE GIRLS ARE GETTING TIRED 
SO WE WANT TO GO HOME 
IT WILL BE READY WITHIN AN HOUR AND A HALF BUT YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY 
GOT THINGS TO DO WE'VE GOT TO STOP SELLING RIGHT NOW 
I KNOW IT'S A BUSY TIME AND THAT MIGHT BE A DECISION THAT 
MIGHT COME TO BITE US IN THE ASS AS IT WERE 
BUT THERE'S NO POINT IN KEEPING TAKING ORDERS IF WE CAN'T DELIVER THEM 
AT THE BUSIEST TIME OF THE DAY THE STAND IS CLOSED 
ON SIMON'S TEAM THEIR SYSTEM OF ORDERING BY NUMBERS ISN'T WORKING 
I NEED TO KNOW BOSTON RIDES

ALEX TRIED TO TELL YOU YOU SPOKE ON TOP OF HIM THERE'S NO POINT IN DOING 
NO ALEX ALSO TOLD ME THAT HIS FORM WAS FINE 
THEY'RE TELLING ME IT'S NOT WE'RE SORTED NOW LET'S DRAW A LINE UNDER IT 
I DON'T FEEL I'VE GOT A TEAM THAT'S ALL PULLING MY DIRECTION CLAIRE IS DOING HER BEST 
CLAIRE IS VERY GOOD AT WHAT SHE DOES BUT SHE'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MANAGE 
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO MANAGE 
CLAIRE'S NEW JOB FERRY THE ORDERS FROM THE SALES PITCH 
TO THE TECHNICAL TEAM TEN MINUTES' WALK AWAY 
SHE MUST DESCRIBE TO THE TECHNICAL TEAM WHAT EACH CUSTOMER LOOKS LIKE AND THE SHOT THEY WANT 
THAT ONE SHE IS BLACK AND WHITE IN COLOUR 
SIMON'S REALLY STRESSED HE'S VERY VERY CONSCIOUS THAT HE 
FEELS THAT HE'S NECK'S ON THE LINE 
AS SOON AS I SAW HIM SOMETIMES SIMON CAN INVADE YOUR PERSONAL SPACE AND I CAN FIND IT QUITE INVASIVE 
HE'S QUITE SORT OF LIKE BODY LANGUAGE 
I JUST HAD TO SAY CALM DOWN STOP SHOUTING 
HE'S LIKE HOW MUCH HAVE YOU DONE WE NEED TO KNOW WILL WE BREAK EVEN 
THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD THOUGH DON'T THEY 
THE TECHNICAL TEAM ARE GETTING PICTURES ONTO PRODUCTS 
BUT CUSTOMERS ARE NOT GETTING WHAT THEY ORDERED 
I SAID THE SECOND PHOTOGRAPH IS THE ONE I WANTED WHERE SHE IS LOOKING AT THE CAMERA YEAH 
I WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT YOU'VE DONE THE SAME HERE IT'S NOTHING WHAT I WANT 
ALL RIGHT I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND I DO APOLOGISE FOR THIS 
IT'S BEEN A MESS UP AND WE'VE MIRROR IMAGED SOME AS WELL 
I'VE SPOKEN TO CLAIRE SHE'S GOT THE BACK ROOM BACK ON TRACK I HAVE TO TRUST HER 
I'VE HAD SOME PHOTOS COME DOWN 
THIS ROGUE PHOTO WHICH WAS ONE OF THE ONES THAT I WASN'T GOING TO USE HAS GONE INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S PACKET 
THEY'VE RETURNED IT TO ME 
SO I'VE TOLD THESE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THESE PEOPLE'S ORDERS 
IS FIVE MINUTES AWAY FIVE MINUTES AGO I SAID DO I NEED TO ASK THEM TO COME BACK IN FIFTEEN MINUTES 
I WAS TOLD IT WILL BE DOWN IN FIVE MINUTES IT ISN'T I'M GOING TO LOSE ANOTHER ONE 
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S ON CRACK OR SOMETHING HE DOES 
HE LOOKS LIKE A SERIOUS CRACK CANER 
HE NEEDS TO JUST CALM DOWN SIMON'S CALLED UP AND SAID EVERYTHING'S GOING TO POT

WE DID WELL DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE COLLECTED THERE 
TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE THIRTY TWENTY FIVE 
FOUR WEEKS AGO THESE THIRTEEN PEOPLE GIVE UP WELL PAID JOBS FOR A CHANCE TO BECOME SIR ALAN'S NEXT APPRENTICE 
NOW ONE OF THEM IS ABOUT TO FIND OUT THE GAMBLE HASN'T PAID OFF 
YOU CAN GO THROUGH TO THE BOARDROOM NOW 
MORNING 
MORNING SIR ALAN 
WELL FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD A VERY 
INTERESTING TASK 
NOW ALPHA TEAM WAS LED BY HELENE 
YES SIR ALAN AND YOUR THEME WAS DAVID BECKHAM LOOKALIKES SIR ALAN 
WHAT DID YOU SELL MOST OF 
WHAT DIDN'T YOU SELL 
THE ACTUAL OTHER PRODUCTS WE WERE OFFERING SIR ALAN WERE VERY POPULAR 
HOWEVER WE DID STRUGGLE WITH THE MANUFACTURING OF THOSE PRODUCTS 
WHY DID YOU STRUGGLE THE MAIN ISSUE WAS THE PROBLEMS THAT LUCINDA HAD IN HER ROLE 
SHE WAS TOTALLY INCOMPETENT IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY WORKING ON WHAT SHE WAS ASSIGNED TO DO 
I AM TECHNICALLY USELESS FROM THE MINUTE THEY PUT YOU 
IN CHARGE OF PRODUCTION WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY LOOK I CAN'T DO THIS GUYS 
I DID YOU DID NOT 
EVERYONE TRIED TO EVEN BURN A C. D. AND NO ONE WAS WILLING TO STEP FORWARD 
I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO TECHNICAL DETAIL 
SHE'S LAZY AND DOESN'T WANT TO PULL HER WEIGHT 
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT IF YOU'RE SEEING THAT YOUR ACTUAL 
PROCESSING OF YOUR BUSINESS IS NOT WORKING WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT 
I DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY WHEN I ORGANISED THIS THING BEING 
IN TECHNOLOGY MYSELF I WANT SOMEONE THERE IN CASE THE THING CONKS OUT DID YOU HAVE SOMEONE THERE 
HE DID COME IN FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND GOT LUCINDA BACK UP AND RUNNING 
AND THIS IS WHY DIDN'T YOU GET HIM TO GET YOU UP AND RUNNING MY KNOWLEDGE BASE WAS BEHIND LUCINDA'S 
THE TECHNICIAN SAID THAT HIS CHILDREN COULD OPERATE THIS 
THERE WAS NO COMPLEXITY TO THIS SURELY THE CORE ISSUE IS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE SHUFFLED THE TEAM 
I THINK YOU WERE A BIT WISHY WASHY 
UNBELIEVABLE A RUNAWAY SUCCESS AND YOU COULDN'T PROCESS THE STUFF 
SIMON I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE THE TEAM LEADER OF YOUR TEAM THAT'S RIGHT SIR ALAN 
AND YOUR THEME WAS 
GLAMOUR AND BEAUTY 
YOUR BLUEWATER SHOPPER WOULD GO OUT IN SOMETHING QUITE DOWDY AND WE COULD JAZZ THEM UP AND GET 
A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN OF THEM LOOKING LIKE THEY WERE NOT SHOPPING 
ACTUALLY SIMON I DISAGREE JENNY AND I WERE THE TARGET CONSUMER 
EXCUSE ME WHOA WAIT I'VE ASKED THE TEAM LEADER TO TELL ME O. K. 
SORRY 
PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOUR THEME WAS IT WAS GLAMOUR AND BEAUTY 
GLAMOUR AND BEAUTY NOW WAS YOU IN CONTROL ALL THE TIME SIMON 
DID YOU THINK YOU HAD THIS THING UNDER CONTROL 
I WAS AWARE OF A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE I FELT I WAS LOSING CONTROL WHY 
THERE WERE SOME ORDER SYSTEM ISSUES 
D'YOU LOSE ANY BUSINESS OVER THIS YES 
HOW MUCH DO YOU RECKON YOU LOST A COUPLE OF HUNDRED POUNDS 
DO YOU THINK YOU LOST IT AT THIS STAGE 
I HAD TO PUT THE CAMERA DOWN WE WERE INUNDATED WITH PEOPLE WANTING THEIR PHOTO TAKEN 
AM I HEARING THAT WE'VE GOT A GOOD BUSINESS GOING I HAD TO STOP SELLING 
YES THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE HEARING THIS IS A JOKE 
YOU GOT PEOPLE MILLING AROUND READY TO SPEND THEIR MONEY AND YOU DIDN'T TAKE THEIR MONEY 
MARGARET LET'S HEAR THE FINANCIAL SIDE OF RENAISSANCE 
WELL RENAISSANCE SIMON'S TEAM SPENT FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN POINT TWO THREE 
THEY TOOK FIVE HUNDRED THREE POINT FOUR TWO SO THEY MADE A LOSS OF SEVENTY THREE POINT EIGHT ONE 
A LOSS YOU HAD ALL THOSE PEOPLE BUZZING AROUND 
YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY AND YOU MADE A LOSS 
INCREDIBLE 
NICK LET'S HEAR ABOUT ALPHA 
ALPHA SPENT FIVE HUNDRED NINETY TWO POINT NINE THREE 
THEY TOOK 
SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT PROVIDING A PROFIT OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE POINT ONE OH 
THANK GOD FOR THAT WELL DONE 
IN RETURN FOR THIS I HAVE ARRANGED A TREAT FOR YOU TODAY WHICH IS ACTUALLY A PRIVATE YACHT 
WHICH IS GOING TO SAIL YOU TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT MOOR UP AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE A DINNER ON BOARD 
O. K. VERY WELL DONE OFF YOU GO 
HAVE A NICE TIME 
SALES GUYS WELL DONE 
A LOSS 
YOU HAD IT IN YOUR GRASP 
YOU BLEW IT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH I'VE GOT TO GO OFF NOW 
I'M GONNA HAVE LUNCH WITH THE PRIME MINISTER 
TALK AMONGST YOURSELVES 
AND I'LL SEE YOU BACK IN THIS BOARDROOM WHEN I GET BACK O. K. 
OFF YOU GO 
GO GO 
BE CAREFUL OF YOUR HEAD 
WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS 
HERE'S TO BEING THE COMEBACK KIDS 
I HAVE A LOT OF CREDIBILITY IN THIS COMPETITION PEOPLE RATE ME BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEEN MY PERFORMANCE 
I THINK PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS LUCINDA 
STAND UP TO THE PLATE BE THE PROJECT MANAGER 
AND I SIR ALAN WILL SEE WHAT SHE'S TRULY 
ALL ABOUT AND THAT IS SOMEBODY WHO IS JUST NOT VERY GOOD AT HER JOB 
CHEERS 
ABSOLUTELY RAVENOUS I'M GONNA MAKE SOME EGGS ON TOAST 
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED IN BETWEEN MANUFACTURING AND DELIVERING IT TO THE CUSTOMER 
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED THERE FOR IT TO BE SUCH A SURPRISE WHEN WE WERE IN THE BOARDROOM 
I'M THINKING WE'VE GOT THIS ONE IN THE BAG 
AND THEN NOT ONLY TO FIND THAT WE HAVEN'T BUT WE'VE MADE A FUCKING LOSS 
DO YOU FEEL THAT MY FACE THOUGHT WE HAD IT IN THE BAG I WAS PETRIFIED 
IT WAS A COMMUNICATION PROBLEM THAT'S WHAT IT WAS THAT'S ALL IT BOILS DOWN TO 
EVERYBODY'S NOW LOOKING AT WAYS TO ABDICATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENED BUT I'M NOT FINISHED YET 
I'M PREPARED GO IN AND FIGHT MY CORNER AND STAND MY GROUND 
IT WOULD BE A MASSIVE ERROR TO TAKE ME BACK INTO THE BOARDROOM BECAUSE I WILL DESTROY HIM 
YOU CAN GO THROUGH TO THE BOARDROOM NOW 
GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON SIR ALAN 
WHERE WE LEFT OFF WAS THAT YOU WENT OUT AND LOST MONEY 
YES SIR ALAN 
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU PUT YOURSELF FORWARD AS TEAM LEADER 
IT WAS A LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC APPROVAL 
I THINK AS A GROUP FROM LIVING WITH SIMON WE'RE ALL VERY CONSCIOUS 
THAT HE IS AN EMOTIONAL PERSON INCREDIBLY PASSIONATE AND MOTIVATED 
THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT IS SOMETIMES WE FEEL LIKE HE IS A MISSILE WHICH IS 
ABOUT TO GO INTO OUTER SPACE AND SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST 
HE CAN COME ACROSS SOMETIMES AS BEING QUITE AGGRESSIVE 
BUT WE KNEW THAT HE WAS VERY KEEN TO DO IT 
DID YOU THINK WELL LET HIM DO IT 
IF WE WIN IT'S GOOD IF WE DON'T WE'RE GOING TO BLAME HIM 
IS THAT WHAT YOU THOUGHT I THOUGHT LET'S GIVE HIM A CHANCE OH YOU DID THAT WAS NICE OF YOU 
WHAT I AM HEARING HERE CLAIRE IS THAT YOU'RE SHOWING NO RESPECT WHATSOEVER TO THIS MAN 
WHETHER HE IS A PLONKER OR NOT IS NOT FOR YOU TO DECIDE 
YOU'RE IN A TEAM THE TEAM'S GOT TO WIN DO YOU UNDERSTAND 
YES AND I APOLOGISE FOR THAT 
NOW YOU'RE APOLOGISING FOR IT BEFORE YOU WERE DENYING THAT YOU DID IT 
I'M NOT APOLOGISING FOR ANYTHING I'M NOT CONSCIOUS THAT'S THE WAY I MADE PEOPLE FEEL 
I APOLOGISE I NEVER EVER WOULD WANT TO MAKE SOMEBODY FEEL LIKE THAT 
I SUPPORTED I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE WHO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THAT 
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE BEING VICTIMISED I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE BEING OSTRACISED 
LET ME TELL YOU FROM WHAT I CAN SEE SO FAR YOU AIN'T THAT BLOODY GREAT YOURSELF 
I HAVEN'T WORKED OUT WHAT THE HELL YOU WERE DOING YESTERDAY QUITE FRANKLY 
JENNY ALEX AND I WORKED WELL TOGETHER WE HAD LOTS OF COMMUNICATION WITH SIMON 
YOU HAD NOT AS MUCH COMMUNICATION AS SIMON WANTED AND WHENEVER YOU SPOKE TO HIM YOU TREATED HIM LIKE DIRT 
I APOLOGISE I DIDN'T WANT TO COME ACROSS THAT WAY AND I WASN'T 
SIMON WHEN THIS SUB GROUP WENT OFF ALEX CLAIRE AND JENNY HOW DID YOU CONTACT THEM 
I WANTED TO APPOINT A SORT OF SECOND IN COMMAND 
SO I ASKED ALEX TO STEP UP AND DO THAT 
ALEX FELT I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO BLAME IF IT WENT WRONG 
HE WAS LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC THAT I WAS THE PROJECT MANAGER 
IS THAT RIGHT NO THAT'S NOT RIGHT AT ALL 
MY POINT WAS DON'T DILUTE OUT TOO MUCH OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
I HAD NO PROBLEM WITH DOING IT 
ALEX 
YES I WAS THERE I DIDN'T STEP BACK FROM IT 
YOU STEPPED SO FAR BACK YOU WERE PRACTICALLY OUT OF THE ROOM 
WHY D'YOU MAKE A LOSS WE MADE A LOSS BECAUSE WE COULDN'T 
DELIVER THE GOODS WHY 
PANIC SET IN AROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND THIRTY AND ACCORDING TO MARGARET 
SHE BELIEVES IT LASTED AT LEAST TILL ONE O'CLOCK NEARLY THREE HOURS 
YOU COULD SEE THAT ON THE SHOP FLOOR 
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT ON THE SHOP FLOOR 
DID YOU FEEL THIS AT ALL 
I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA THAT THERE WAS ALL THIS CATASTROPHIC SITUATION 
WHAT WERE YOU DOING CLAIRE I WAS ORGANISING THE ORDERS AND 
WHY DIDN'T YOU RELAY TO THEM I DID THAT THERE WAS AGGRAVATION ON THE SHOP FLOOR 
THEY KNEW WE WERE TOLD WHAT WAS A PRIORITY WE WEREN'T PROVIDED WITH THE FULL PICTURE 
YOU DIDN'T GET A SENSE OF SOMETHING GOING WRONG DEFINITELY NOT 
I AM NOT GETTING A CLEAR PICTURE HERE OF WHAT YOU DID 
I'M GETTING THE OPINION THAT YOU'RE GOOD AT EXCUSES 
SIR ALAN I'M NOT GOOD AT EXCUSES 
YOU ARE GOOD AT EXCUSES 
YOU'RE VERY VERY GOOD AT EXCUSES 
I'VE GOT TWO PEOPLE TELLING ME THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING ON ON THE SHOP FLOOR 
THAT'S THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHAT 
THAT'S THE ABSOLUTE NAIL ON THE HEAD 
ALEX WHO MISCOMMUNICATED THE MOST 
INITIALLY IT WAS DOWN TO THE PROJECT MANAGER 
NOW HEARING IT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE RUNNING THE INFORMATION BETWEEN US AND THE FRONT END 
SO YOU'RE SAYING CLAIRE 
SIMON YOU WERE THE TEAM LEADER 
YOU TELL ME WHICH TWO PEOPLE YOU ARE BRINGING BACK IN THIS BOARDROOM 
ALEX AND CLAIRE ALEX AND CLAIRE O. K. 
ALL RIGHT YOU OTHER THREE GO BACK TO THE HOUSE 
NOTHING'S GONNA WORK WITH CLAIRE SHE'S NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SHE'S THE LINK 
SHE WAS THE LINK AND SHE FAILED TO KEEP THE FACTORY TRULY INFORMED AS TO THE STATE OF THINGS 
SIMON YOU KNOW HE MAKES QUITE A LOT OF NOISE 
HE'S NOT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT RESPONSIBLE 
THE PEOPLE IN THE PRODUCTION ROOM DID KNOW MORE THAN THEY'RE LETTING ON 
LISTEN I THINK I'VE HEARD ENOUGH 
WE'LL CALL THESE THREE BACK IN 
HELLO CAN YOU SEND THE THREE OF THEM IN PLEASE 
YES SIR ALAN 
SIR ALAN IS READY FOR YOU NOW 
SIMON SIR ALAN 
WHAT YOU DOING HERE 
CLAIRE IS VERY DISMISSIVE OF ME 
I'M TALKING TO HIM AT THE MOMENT I CAN'T GET THROUGH TO SOMEONE THAT'S UNMANAGEABLE 
PLEASE MAY I PASS COMMENT I DON'T THINK YOU ARE AWARE OF HOW YOU ARE PERSONALLY 
I THINK THAT ACCUSATION COULD BE EQUALLY LEVELLED AT YOU 
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW AGGRESSIVE AND ASSERTIVE YOU CAN BE WHEN YOU'RE JUST DISMISSIVE 
WHEN I SAID I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER 
YOUR IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WAS A DISMISSIVE DON'T BE AUTOCRATIC 
I HADN'T BEEN AUTOCRATIC UP UNTIL THAT POINT 
YOU WERE NOT LISTENING TO FEEDBACK FROM SARA 
SARA WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING AND YOU TURNED TO SARA AND WENT I'M PROJECT MANAGER 
YOUR BODY LANGUAGE WAS LIKE THIS 
YOU WERE SHOUTING AND IT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY PLEASANT 
CLAIRE IN YOUR APPLICATION TO THIS PROCESS YOU'VE MADE SOME COMMENTS 
AND I READ THAT YOUR WORST QUALITIES ARE THAT YOU ARE IMPATIENT 
I AM IMPATIENT BUT YOU CAN OVERPOWER PEOPLE WHO AREN'T AS VOCAL AS YOU 
I'D LIKE TO MEET THAT BLEEDIN' PERSON WHO AIN'T AS VOCAL AS YOU I'D NEED A COUPLE OF EAR PADS 
I'M SICK AND BLOODY TIRED OF IT QUITE FRANKLY 
IS IT TRUE YOU REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON THE CHAOS THERE 
IF I HAD MADE A MISTAKE I WOULD HOLD MY HANDS UP AND SAY I MADE A MISTAKE 
EVERYBODY LEARNS BY THEIR MISTAKES 
YOU AND JENNY WERE NOT IN THIS POSITION WHERE YOU HAD NO CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON THEY SAID THEY WERE 
THEY'RE SAYING WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS HAPPENING SIMON WERE THEY ARE ISOLATED IN THE BACKROOM OR NOT 
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE ISOLATED EVERYBODY IS CULPABLE HERE 
I'M NOT TRYING TO PASS THE BUCK 
EVERYBODY SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO PASS THE BUCK 
I MADE PEOPLE LAUGH AND SMILE IN THAT SHOPPING CENTRE YESTERDAY 
I WAS CREATIVE I CREATED A BUZZ AROUND MY PHOTOGRAPHY STAND 
IF I COULD HAVE HAD MY ORDERS DELIVERED I'D HAVE MADE YOU A FORTUNE 
I'D HAVE MADE YOU A FORTUNE BUT YOU DIDN'T EARLY INDICATIONS WERE YOU WEREN'T TAKING THE MONEY 
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS RECTIFIED BY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY YOU STILL WEREN'T TAKING THE MONEY 
AT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY STILL SOUNDS LIKE BLOODY CHAOS 
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH 
IT'S ALMOST INSULTING ME IN SAYING I DID DRUM UP A LOT OF BUSINESS 
THE ONLY THING IS I SCREWED EVERYTHING ELSE UP I DIDN'T SCREW UP THE ORDER DELIVERY 
ONE OF YOUR TEAM DID AND YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM 
I'M YES 
WHY SHOULDN'T I FIRE YOU HERE TODAY 
BECAUSE I CAN DO THIS I'VE GOT CONFIDENCE IN MY OWN ABILITY I'M LEARNING I'M GROWING 
LEARNING AT MY EXPENSE BY LOSING ME MONEY IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN 
IT MAY NOT HAPPEN AGAIN MY FRIEND I CAN ASSURE YOU 
ALEX WHO SHOULD BE FIRED HERE TODAY 
CLAIRE CLAIRE WHO SHOULD BE FIRED HERE TODAY 
SIMON 
CAN I SAY THAT I DID MY JOB TO THE BEST TO MY CAPABILITIES AND I WAS GOING FROM AND SO DID I 
FROM THE PROJECT MANAGER 
I'M BEING TREATED LIKE A SCAPEGOAT WHY BECAUSE THERE'S EMOTIONS INVOLVED 
THINGS HAVE BECOME PERSONAL 
IT HASN'T BECOME PERSONAL THIS IS ENTIRELY A BUSINESS DECISION 
SIMON I THINK YOU ARE INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE 
I'M NOT SENSITIVE I LOST MONEY BUT THE REASON I LOST MONEY AND I COULD HAVE MADE A FORTUNE 
IN THAT SHOPPING CENTRE IF WE HAD STARTED COULD'VE COULD HAVE COULD'VE SHOULD'VE WOULD'VE 
BUT YOU DIDN'T 
NO SIR ALAN I DIDN'T YEAH 
I THINK I'VE HEARD ENOUGH TO MAKE A VERY VERY DIFFICULT DECISION HERE TODAY 
SIR ALAN MAY I SAY ONE MORE THING PLEASE 
IF YOU INSIST 
IN THIS COMPETITION IF YOU REMAIN QUIET AND UNDER THE RADAR PEOPLE ASSUME THEY'RE SAFE 
AND I'VE BEEN BOLD AND I KNOW I'M VOCAL 
YOU HAVE BEEN BOLD ALL RIGHT IT PUTS ME IN A VULNERABLE POSITION I'M SORRY I'VE SAT HERE 
THE TROUBLE IS YOU NEVER BACK OFF I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH YOU 
I'M GETTING SICK AND TIRED OF YOU DENYING ALL THIS 
I'M SICK OF LOOKING AT YOU AT THE MOMENT GET OUT THAT DOOR 
GET BACK TO THE BLOODY HOUSE O. K. 
GET BACK TO THE HOUSE YEAH 
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE NEXT TEAM LEADER I'M SICK OF LOOKING AT YOU 
GET OUT THAT DOOR AND GET BACK TO THE HOUSE 
SIMON IF I ASK YOU TO BUILD ME A WALL YOU'D BUILD ME A WALL I'M PRETTY SURE OF IT 
IF I ASKED YOU TO DIG ME A TRENCH I THINK YOU'D DIG ME A TRENCH 
I'M NOT SURE 
THAT IF I GAVE YOU MY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO YOU'D BE ABLE TO RUN THAT VERY WELL 
I'M SORRY MY FRIEND I THINK YOU'RE A BIT OUT OF YOUR DEPTH HERE 
AND WITH REGRET YOU'RE FIRED 
THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY 
THANK YOU SIR ALAN GOODBYE 
GO AND WIN IT ALL RIGHT 
THE TAXI'S READY FOR YOU NOW 
THANK YOU 
I SAID FROM THE MOMENT WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION IT'S NOT SIMON 
IT'LL BE ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT GOES IN WITH HIM FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD IT'S GOING TO BE CLAIRE 
I THINK CLAIRE'S GOING 
SH 
WHO'S COMING UP CAN WE HAVE A DRUM ROLL PLEASE 
MATE 
HE WENT YOU CAN GO I WAS LIKE 
YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE HOUSE AND YOU'RE PROJECT MANAGER NEXT TIME 
SO SORRY FOLKS I'VE GOT TO BE PROJECT MANAGER AGAIN 
I GIVE IT MY BEST SHOT I GIVE IT EVERYTHING I HAD I GAVE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT IN EVERY TASK I DID 
I MADE A LOT OF PEOPLE SMILE IN THAT SHOPPING CENTRE AND THAT WAS A GOOD FEELING 
AT THE END OF THE DAY I FAILED I GO HOME NOW PICK MYSELF UP 
I'LL BE PUTTING SATELLITE DISHES UP AGAIN NEXT WEEK 
ONE JOB TWELVE CANDIDATES REMAIN 
SIR ALAN'S SEARCH FOR HIS APPRENTICE CONTINUES 
NEXT WEEK SIR ALAN DOORSTEPS THE CANDIDATES 
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS DESIGN AND DEVELOP 
SEVERAL FLAVOURS OF ICE CREAM AND SELL THOSE FLAVOURS TO THE TRADE 
BUT WHICH TEAM WILL SELL ENOUGH TO LICK THE OPPOSITION 
THAT IS THE SIGN OF A GOOD SALESPERSON WE KEPT UP THE MOMENTUM 
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TURN A DEAL DOWN A DEAL WHICH IS NOT GOOD 
FOR THE LONG TERM OF THE BUSINESS 
YOU'RE FIRED
