BUTTON ANTHONY HAMILTON IN THE 
COMMENTARY BOX AT STEVE DAVIS AND 
CLIVE EVERTON 
MY COLLEAGUE FOR THE 
EVENING STEVE DAVIS WONDERS GREAT 
CHAMPIONSHIP SIX TIMES IN THE NINETEEN 
EIGHTIES ONE UP THIS GREAT 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
JOHN HIGGINS HOPES TO MAKE IT THREE 
THIS YEAR TO GET AHEAD OF MARK 
WILLIAMS AND RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HE HE MADE A VERY GOOD START TO HIS 
CAMPAIGN IN BEATING MATTHEW STEVENS 
IT WAS A TRICKY FIRST ROUND MATCH 
BUT HERE IS ANOTHER TRICKY OPPONENT 
RYAN DAY HAS CLIMBED TO SEVENTH IN THE 
PROVISIONAL WORLD RANKINGS HE HAS 
REACHED TWO WORLD CUP RANKING 
FINALS THE MALTA CUP LAST SEASON 
AND THE SHANGHAI MASTERS AT THE 
START OF THIS SEASON 
POSSIBLY HE IS A LITTLE BIT UNDER 
THE RADAR FOR MOST OF THE BRITISH 
PUBLIC AS THOSE EVENTS WERE NOT 
SHOWN ON TERRESTRIAL TELEVISION HE 
CAME HERE IN GOOD FORM BEATEN SIX TO FIVE 
IN THE SEMI FINALS OF THE LAST 
TOURNAMENT THE CHINA OPEN THAT SAFETY HAD TO BE VERY THIN 
BUT THE POCKET PERHAPS NOT THE 
WORST PLACE FOR IT BECAUSE AT 
LEAST JOHN HIGGINS HAS TO POT THE 
RED FROM DISTANCE 
HE DID NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
CANNONING OTHER BALLS JUST GET 
ABOUT THE BLUE AND IMMEDIATELY A 
PROMISING OPPORTUNITY 
THE ONLY 
PROBLEM IS THAT THE BLACK SPOT IS 
OCCUPIED 
HE IS NOT ON THE RED COVERING THE 
BLACK SPOT AT THE MOMENT BUT HE 
DOES NOT HAVE TO POT IT HE COULD 
ALSO NUDGE IT AWAY 
THIS MUST BE A PROBLEM JOHN 
HIGGINS DOES NOT NORMALLY SPEND SO 
LONG TRYING TO WORK OUT A 
POSITIONAL SHOT 
HE DID NOT WANT TO HAVE TO DO WOULD 
BY THAT METHOD THE BLUE IS STILL 
IN PLAY THE PINK POPS INTO A SIDE 
POCKET 
JUST DROPPING THE RED IN KEATES 
THE CUE BALL SHORT OF THE BALL 
CLIMB FOR CHOICE OF ALL COLOURS 
SHORT OF THE BAULK LINE 
IT DID NOT TAKE JOHN HIGGINS LONGED 
TO RELIEVE THE CONGESTION AROUND 
THE BLACK SPOT 
THIS MATCH SPREAD OVER THREE 
SESSIONS TONIGHT TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON AND SATURDAY MORNING 
EVERY CHANCE OF THE HIGHEST BREAK 
OF THE TOURNAMENT COMING UP HERE 
DE HIGHEST BREAK SO FAR A 
COMPARATIVELY MODEST ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO BY JOE 
PERRY 
IT HIGGINS COULD MAKE A CENTURY 
HERE IT WOULD BE THREE IN THREE 
FRAMES IN THIS A RAYNER BECAUSE HE 
COMPLETED HIS TEN TO FIVE WIN OVER MACKIE 
STEVENS WITH BREAKS OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY AND ONE HUNDRED THREE 
MATTHEW STEVENS 
HIGGINS HAS ALREADY DONE ENOUGH TO 
SECURE THE FRAME NOW IT GET A BIT MORE DIFFICULT 
HE WOULD NOT HAVE STILL BEEN ON 
COURSE FOR A CENTURY BUT FOR THAT 
VERY FORTUNATE KISS 
VERY TOUGH WITH THE SPIDER 
STRIKING DOWNWARDS IF IT 
HAD NOT 
BEEN THE OPENING 
FRAME I DO NOT THINK RYAN DAY 
WOULD HAVE COME BACK TO THE TABLE 
HE DID SO JUST POSSIBLY TO 
SETTLED HIS NERVES ALTHOUGH HE 
MISSED PRETTY SIMPLE POT 
SAY CLOSE UP YOU MIGHT NEED DOES 
LATER SAVE THOSE UP 
THIS TIME AND RYAN DAY DOES NOT 
CARRY ON JOHN HIGGINS KEEP SOME 
SCHOOLS IN THAT OPENING FRAME 
ONE HUNDRED TWO FROM ANTHONY HAMILTON TO MAKE 
IT EIGHT TO TWO DO YOU THINK PLAYERS RELAX 
A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE SECOND 
ROUND 
THE TOP PLAYERS ALWAYS ROUND BELIEVED THAT THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS BEGINS AT THE SECOND 
ROUND WITH THREE SESSIONS BEST OF 
TWENTY FIVE YOU CAN BE ALLOWED A FEW ERRORS 
BUT STILL COME BACK BUT JOHN 
HIGGINS LOOKED IN TERRIFIC FORM 
THERE 
I'VE HEARD TO THIS AFTERNOON THERE SUGGESTING THAT THE TOURNAMENT ONLY 
REALLY GETS GOING NOW 
THAT IS HOW 
THE PLAYERS FEEL GETTING OVER THAT 
FIRST ROUND IN TWO SESSIONS IS WHAT 
THEY WANT TO DO 
I THINK ONLY TWO 
PLAYERS HAVE WON THE TITLE AND 
RETAINED IT HERE STEVE DAVIS AND 
STEPHEN HENDRY SO THERE IS A GREAT 
TARGET FOR JOHN HIGGINS 
IF ANYONE 
CAN DO IT JOHN HIGGINS CAN DO RED 
WHITE HAS BRIAN DAY CONNECT AFTER 
THAT FIRST FRAME 
IN FACT WE 
THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO CONCEDE 
BUT HE CAME TO THE TABLE TO GET 
SOME PRACTICE AND MISSED THAT RED 
BY A LONG WAY PERHAPS HE HAS GONE 
OUT TO COMPOSE HIMSELF 
HE HAS BEEN 
CHARGING UP THE WORLD RANKINGS OF 
LATE 
HE IS A BRILLIANT PLAYER AND LATE QUITE CAPABLE OF LIFTING THE WORLD 
TITLE 
RYAN DAY MADE A CENTURY IN HIS 
OPENING MATCH BEATING MICHAEL 
JUDGE 
YOU WOULD QUITE AN IMPORTANT FIGURE 
IN RYAN DAY'S DEVELOPMENT STEVE 
IN THAT YOU WERE THE FIRST BIG GAME 
THAT HE BEAT 
THANKS CLIVE FOUR TO ZERO UP 
AGAINST HIM IT LOST FIVE ON THE 
TROT A GOOD PLAYER BUT THE 
BIGGEST ACCOLADE RECENTLY MAKING A 
CASE FOR RYAN DAY TALKING TO MARK 
WILLIAMS PRE SEASON SAYING THAT HE 
FELT THAT RYAN DAY WAS ON THE VERGE 
OF WINNING A TOURNAMENT HE CAME 
CLOSE AT THE SHANGHAI OPEN LOSING 
OUT MAINLY TO DOMINIC DALE'S 
HAIRCUT 
HE HAS A STRONG CUE ACTION AND 
MAKES PLENTY OF BREAKS 
IN THE FIRST ROUND DOES NOT MATTER 
HOW WOULD YOU PLAY YOU'RE JUST 
RELIEVED TO GET OVER THE LINE IN 
THE SECOND FRAME YOU START TO COOL 
IT IS BUSINESS AS USUAL AND 
SESSIONS ROLL BY ANDY FIELD 
YOURSELF VERY MUCH IN A CROOK 
AND YOU FEEL YOURSELF VERY MUCH IN 
THE MOOD 
IS IT TRUE AS WELL THAT 
IN EIGHTY THREE SESSION MATCH IN THE 
AND NOT 
WORRY ABOUT RESULT 
YES THE 
FINISHING LINE IS A LONG WAY OFF TOUCHING BALL 
HE'S A GOOD TIME FOUR ONE DAY'S 
FAMILY HIS YOUNGER BROTHER IS 
CAPTAIN OF ALDERSHOT TOWN THE 
RUNAWAY WINNERS OF THE BLUE SQUARE 
PREMIERSHIP FOUL AND A MISS THAT WAS A FAILURE OF TOUCH 
ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF A NURSE 
POSSIBLY 
THESE ARE LIGHTNING FAST CONDITIONS 
AND SOMETIMES YOU UNDERHIT THE SHOT 
THE TABLE IN MY OPINION AT THE 
TABLE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST FAST 
CLOTH PLAYERS THE GAME HAS SEEN 
JOHN HIGGINS NEVER SEEMS TO OVERHIT 
THE SHOT ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE IN 
CONTROL OF HIS CUE AND STROKED THE 
BALL AROUND THE TABLE 
IT REQUIRES NOT JUST GREAT TOUCH 
BUT GREAT POSITION SO THEY HE DID 
NOT HAVE TO WHACK THE BALLS AROUND 
TO GET POSITION 
HE NEVER SEEMS TO 
PLAY AN ILLOGICAL SHOT HE SHOT 
SELECTION IS IMMACULATE YES YES GENERALLY HE IS QUITE ANNOYING 
AN UNUSUAL SET OF OPEN RED 
CLUSTERED UP THE BOTTOM OF THE 
TABLE OPEN REDS IN NORMAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES PLAYERS LIKE GO INTO 
THE PACK BUT THERE ARE OTHER 
TEMPTATIONS ON THE TABLE 
IF THERE ARE ANY PLANS IN THE PACK 
HE DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO 
OPEN THEM UP 
HE HAS HAD A LOOK BEFORE AT THE 
PLANT TO THE RIGHT CORNER 
THAT IS 
CLOSE ENOUGH THERE IS THE THREE 
BALL PLANT THAT HE IS LOOKING AT 
THE CUE BALL PLANT LOOKED MAKE A 
BALL TO ME LOOKED POSSIBLE 
THAT IS THE OTHER ONE HE IS LOOKING 
OUT WHAT IS HE LOOKING AT 
HE MUST HAVE DECIDED AGAINST THE 
PLANTS 
THAT IT LOOKED O. K. HE MUST PLANTS HAVE DECIDED THAT IN OPENING THE 
PACK HAD WAS ALMOST GUARANTEED TO 
SPLIT NICELY THAT OPENING 
ANOTHER CHANCE OF A BIG BREAK L. AM 
NOT TOO SURE HOW BIG L. HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING OUT THE MATHS 
IT SEEMS TO HAVE COME TO AN END HE 
MUST KEEP ON THE HEIGHT COLOURS 
CAN HE CHIPPED THE RED INTO THE 
CORNER POCKET HE IS NOT OVER THE 
LINE HE CANNOT TAKE TOO MUCH OF A 
RISK 
THAT WAS A BIT SHORT OF PACE HE 
WILL SETTLE FOR THE YELLOW WHO 
JOHN HIGGINS OPENED THE MATCH WITH 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR POINTS THAT IS RYAN DAY'S 
FIRST POT 
WHAT A FANTASTIC SHOT IT 
WAS 
HE HAS AN OUTSIDE CHANCE OF 
STEALING THE FRAME 
I WOULD SAY THERE IS A DIFFICULTY 
FACTOR WITH THE REST 
HE CAN KNOCK A TAD FROM THE SIDE 
CUSHION IT OUT 
IT WOULD BE A TERRIFIC 
PSYCHOLOGICAL BOOST IF HE COULD 
SNATCHED THE FRAME SNATCH 
AS THE SECOND HE CAN CHOOSE TO TAKE 
THE RED DOWN THE SIDE CUSHION AS 
THE SECOND LAST 
OR THE 
LAST IT MAY 
BE BENEFICIAL TO PLAY IT AS THE 
SECOND LAST HE WILL PLAY THE RED 
DOWN THE SIDE CUSHION 
THAT IS NOT TOO BAD IT IS A LITTLE 
BIT WIDE HE HAS GOT AN ANGLE HE 
NEEDS TO DROP IT IN AT A DEAD 
WEIGHT SO THAT IT WILL WOBBLE IN 
THE JAWS AND GIVE UP AND GRAVITY 
CAN TAKE EFFECT THEN THERE WILL BE 
THE REAL POSSIBILITY OF A CLEARANCE 
THAT JUSTIFIED HIS CHOICE OF 
PLAYING THE MORE DIFFICULT RED 
FIRST FULL STUFF FIRST 
WELL HE LIKES TO PUNCH THAN JUST 
ROLLING IT A BAD MISS A CRUMB 
OF COMFORT THE BLACK HAS COVERED 
THE POCKET 
HE WAS FORCED TO PLAY 
IT SLOW 
IF RYAN DAY GETS A SNIFF AT THE RED 
IS VERY POSSIBILITY IT GOES IN FOR 
BLACK 
IT IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE SHOULD 
SOMEBODY WANT TO TAKE THE REST 
PROBABLY A WISE CHOICE IF RYAN DAY 
HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET HIS HAND ON 
THE TABLE HE MAY HAVE HAD A CLOSER 
LOOK AS TO WHERE THE BLACK CAUSE WAS LOOK WHAT HE HAS DONE 
IF HE HAD HIT THAT RIGHT IT WAS A 
CHANCE TO MAKE WINNING CLEARANCE 
HE HAS HANDED THE FRAME TO HIGGINS 
AND WE BIT EIGHTY TWO TO ZERO LEAD WITH IT A TWO TO ZERO LEAD 
HE NEEDED FOR TWO FOR SNOOKERS TO 
TIGHT BUT HE HAS CONCEDED HIGGINS 
LEADS BY EIGHT TWO FRAMES TO NIL THE THE GREATEST PERFORMERS WOULD HAVE BEEN 
MY FIRST WORLD TITLE IT WAS MY 
GREATEST PERFORMANCE BEATING THE 
DEFENDING CHAMPION IN THE FINAL L. 
THINK YOU REALISE HOW HARD IT CAN 
BE TO WIN THE WORLD TITLE WHEN YOU 
FIRST WIN IT YOU THINK IT IS A 
HARDPOINT THE EASIEST PART WOULD 
BE TO WIN MORE IT IS EXACTLY THE 
OPPOSITE FOR ME I MANAGED TO 
DIRECT LAST SEASON DO IT L. HAVE 
BEEN PRACTISING FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS L. 
LIKE WINNING A TOURNAMENT YOU WANT 
THE SAME FEELING AGAIN THAT IS 
WHAT GETS YOU OUT OF BED IN THE 
MORNING 
NOT THE BEST BREAK OFF SHOT FROM 
JOHN HIGGINS 
I IT WAS A BIT SURPRISED AT THE END 
OF THE FRAME THAT RYAN DAY DID NOT 
TRIED TO 
CONTINUE TO 
GET COUPLE 
OF SNOOKERS NOW HE HAS BEEN GIVEN 
THE FIRST RED IT WAS THE RIGHT 
CHOICE IN SOME WAYS HE IS BACK ON 
THE TABLE OF KNOCKING BALLS IN 
KNOCKING EIGHT PRETTY UNINVITING 
PACK OF REDS FROM BLUE INTO THE PACK LOOKS NICER 
SHOULD HE GET THE CHANCE TO POT THE 
BLACK AND PLAY 
POSITION ON 
THE LOOSE 
REDS THAT WOULD BE NICE 
HE IS RUNNING OUT OF REDS TO DO 
THAT THIS WILL BE HIS LAST RIDE 
TRY THAT WAS A DOG OF A SHOT 
MUST HAVE GOT KICK IT WAS A VERY 
DEAD CONTACT IT HAS MATCH PRODUCED 
HIS POSITIONAL OPTIONS REDUCED 
HE COULD POSSIBLY CANNON OFF THE 
BACK OF THE BUNCH 
THAT WAS CRIMINAL HE DID ALL THE 
HARD WORK 
RULE ONE DO NOT MISS 
THE EASY BALL OFF CONCENTRATING ON 
POSITION 
CONCENTRATING WE HAVE ALL BEEN 
THAT YOU DO NOT GIVE THE RED THE 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CONCENTRATION IT NEEDS 
A KLOSE 
LIKE ALL GREAT PLAYERS JOHN 
HIGGINS IS A GREAT PREDATOR HE CAN 
SEE THEIR HIS OPPONENT IS EDGY HE 
SENSES THE CHANCE TO GET CLEAN AWAY 
IF YOU WERE WATCHING THIS AFTERNOON 
AND THE LATTER STAGES OF PETER 
EBDON HE WAS GETTING INTO THE 
RELENTLESS MADE OF SNOOKER THAT 
KNOW HE CAN PLAY 
WHERE HE LOOKS 
LIKE HE IS 
NEVER GOING TO MISS A 
BALL 
WE RECALL HIS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FOUR N. T. S. WITHOUT 
REPLY INCLUDING FOUR CENTURIES IN 
THE GRAND PRIX THREE YEARS AGO 
HE HAS GOT THE ONE INTO THE MIDDLE 
POCKET ONCE AGAIN JOHN HIGGINS 
DID NOT BANK ATTIC BANG AT IT 
WHAT A MARVELLOUS START FOR JOHN 
HIGGINS MANY PEOPLE FANCY RYAN DAY 
AS A DARK HORSE FOR THIS EVENT 
JOHN HIGGINS'S FANS WILL BE 
DELIGHTED 
AS YOU CAN SEE TWO REDS GOING TO 
THE RIGHT CENTRE PERHAPS ONE INTO 
THE RIGHT CORNER AS WELL 
HE PLAYED FOR ONE INTO THE RIGHT 
CORNER THE ONE IT HAS OPENED UP 
MORE REDS 
HE COULD HAVE DONE WITH BEING 
FURTHER UP THE TABLE BUT THAT WAS A 
CLEVER SHOT HE CAN WORK AROUND THE 
PINK SPOT 
AFTER WATCHING JOHN PARROTT AGAINST 
MATTHEW STEVENS JOHN WAS OF THE 
PINION THAT WE HAVE A POSSIBLY 
LOOKING AT THIS YEAR'S WORLD 
CHAMPION OPINION MAYBE MAYBE ALTHOUGH I THINK HIGGINS COULD 
EXPECT TO ENCOUNTER BETTER SAFETY 
PLAYED THAN HE DID FROM STEVENS 
IT IS A GREAT TESTAMENT TO JOHN 
HIGGINS'S CHARACTER THAT HE HAS 
PICKED UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF LAST 
YEAR 
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU HOW YEAR SIGNIFICANT YOU THOUGHT THAT MIGHT 
BE THE ANSWER APPEARS TO BECOME A 
HOT AIR TOUR APPEARS TO BE NOT 
AT ALL 
THE ONLY REMAINING ISSUE IS WHETHER 
HIGGINS CAN MAKE A CENTURY 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS EIGHTY SIXTH 
CENTURY AT THE CRUCIBLE MEANWHILE 
THE EIGHTEENTH OR BREAK EXTENDS HIS LEAD 
HE IS GOING STRONG EIGHTY FOUR LET'S LET'S CHECK ON THE STEVE MAGUIRE ANTHONY 
HAMILTON MATCH IT LOOKS LIKE STEVE 
MAGUIRE IS GOING THROUGH TO THE 
SECOND ROUND HE IS IN WITH A 
CHANCE OF 
MAXIMUM ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN HE HAS 
HE HAS TAKEN THEM REALLY WELL A MAXIMUM 
GO HE HAD AN ANGLE ON THE BLACK SO 
HE IS O. K. 
HE HAD THERE HAVE BEEN 
QUITE IF YOU MAXIMUM THE TENTH SO 
FAR A FEW MAXIMUM ATTEMPTS 
IT IS THERE HE HAS FINISHED 
STRAIGHT UP ON THE BLACK HE NEEDS 
A LOT OF REVERSE SIDE HE WILL BE 
PLAYING WITH RIGHT HAND SIDE AND 
SCREW 
HE HAS HAD A HEAVY CONTACT HE HAS 
HAD A KICK 
THAT IS WHY HE IS DOING 
THE WALK DANCE 
HE HAS STILL GOT A 
CHANCE 
THE HEAVY CONTACT THERE IS SO MUCH 
PRESSURE ON THIS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND ON THIS 
RED 
ONCE AGAIN ANOTHER MAXIMUM ATTEMPT 
GOES BY THE WAYSIDE WHEN YOU ARE 
SO CLOSE AND YOU GET SO ANGRY AND 
YOU LEAVE THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE HOW 
DO YOU STOP IT AFFECTING YOU 
HAS GOT 
SUCH A GOOD 
LEAD 
SEE HOW 
MUCH HE WANTED 
THE MAXIMUM 
SEE HOW MUCH HE WANTED THE MAXIMUM BREAK STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE IS 
LIKE THAT 
HE HAS 
GOT TO 
WIN THE MATCH 
HE IS 
GOING TO GO THROUGH THE THOUGHT OF 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND HOW DO YOU ERASE IT YOU YOU FORGET ABOUT IT 
MANY PEOPLE ARE 
TIPPING HIM TO BE AL WINNER HE HE REALLY HAS BECOME GOOD STEVE 
MAGUIRE WILL TAKE A BIT OF BEATING 
IT IS THE MOST OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP WE 
HAVE EVER HAD 
LET'S GO BACK TO THE 
OTHER MATCH WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING 
THIS EVENING JOHN HIGGINS AGAINST 
RYAN DAY AND A GREAT START FOR THE 
DEFENDING CHAMPION 
RYAN DAY HAS 
POTTED A LONG RED 
STEVE MAGUIRE HAD A CHANCE AND WENT 
OUT OF THE WIND ROOM 
WOULD HE HAVE CONCEDED THE FRAME 
THAT IS A BIT OF AN ACADEMIC POINT 
IT IS NOT A NICE START FOR RYAN DAY 
THAT IS IT OBVIOUS I'M SURE HE 
FELT HE WAS IN GREAT FORM 
RYAN DAY HAS MISSED BALLS THIS 
EVENING THAT HE NEVER MISSES IT IS A LONG MATCH THREE SESSIONS 
THE ONLY SAVING GRACE IN SOME 
RESPECTS WOULD BE THAT THEIR 
ROSEANNE INTERVAL COMING AND THE 
CHANCE TO IMMENSELY REGROUP 
THERE IS AN IT IS A HORRIBLE TIME 
FOR RYAN DAY UNTIL YOU GET YOUR 
FIRST FRAME ON THE BOARD YOU NEVER 
SETTLE DOWN 
THAT WAS AN ANXIOUS LOOK FROM 
HIGGINS 
HE DID NOT WANT TO BE NEAR THAT 
CUSHION THIS IS PERMISSIBLE MISSABLE 
THAT WAS A GREAT EFFORT TO SPLIT 
THE PACK OPEN FOR AS IF IT WAS 
NEVER GOING TO BE EASY OPEN 
HIGGINS HAS NOT MISSED ANYTHING OF 
NOTE YET 
I ASKED JOHN IF HE HAD BEEN HOME 
BETWEEN MATCHES BUT HE SAID HE HAD 
GONE TO THE ACADEMY TO HAVE SOME 
PRACTICE THE REFEREE HAS A VERY STEADY HAND 
THIS IS A VERY DELICATE JOB THE 
REFEREE DECIDES THAT THE PINK WILL 
NOT GO BETWEEN THE TWO REDS 
I BET 
HIS FRONT LIVING ROOM IS PERFECT 
NOT A CHECK OUT OF PLACE CHAIR 
THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT 
ON B. B. C. TWO YOU CAN SEE THE REST OF 
THE NIGHT'S SNOOKER BY USING THE 
RED BUTTON WE WILL BE BACK AT 
ELEVEN FIFTY P. M. 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET 
YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
