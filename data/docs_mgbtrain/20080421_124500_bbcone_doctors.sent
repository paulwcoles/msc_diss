BLUE SKY THINKING YEAH REALLY EXCITING BIG IDEAS INNOVATION 
GO MAD WHAT DANIEL 
I'M JUST GOING TO THANK HER FOR EARLIER 
HELLO HELLO 
HOW IS SHE SHE'S FINE TWENTY FIVE YEARS I'VE LIVED HERE 
I'VE NEVER KNOWN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE CAN I ASK YOU A FAVOUR 
OH YES ANYTHING 
SINCE MY HUSBAND DIED ALL I'VE HAD IS TIME ON MY HANDS 
SOMETIMES I THINK I'LL GO CRAZY IN THERE NO ONE TO TALK TO 
SO YOU JUST TELL HER IF THERE'S ANYTHING SHE NEEDS JUST PHONE ME AND I'LL POP STRAIGHT OVER 
THAT'S SORT OF EXACTLY WHAT SHE DOESN'T NEED 
I'M SORRY TANYA NEEDS TO DO THINGS FOR HERSELF THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS 
UNTIL SHE IS ABLE TO LOOK AFTER HERSELF SHE WON'T FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT LIVING ALONE 
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP 
I KNOW BUT SHE CAN GET VERY PRICKLY WHEN SHE THINKS PEOPLE ARE INTERFERING INTERFERING 
THAT'S THE WAY SHE SEES IT WELL I'M SORRY 
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THINGS HAVE BEEN VERY TOUGH SINCE THE ACCIDENT 
AND THE BEST THING WE CAN DO IS TO LET HER GET ON O. K. O. K. 
RIGHT THANKS 
CAN I HELP YOU WE'D LIKE TO REGISTER O. K. 
WE WHY DO YOU NEED TO REGISTER I'VE DECIDED TO STAY YOU HAVE 
JUST UNTIL I KNOW YOU'RE SAFE IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT TO LEAVE YOU NOW 
NOT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING 
THERE YOU GO THANK YOU 
AND I'D LIKE TO SEE A DOCTOR 
DOCTOR BELL IF POSSIBLE 
O. K. SHE'S GOT A DROP IN CLINIC THIS MORNING 
SHE'S FREE NOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO ON THROUGH 
IT'S ROUND TO THE LEFT LAST ROOM AT THE END O. K. 
ERM I THINK I'D LIKE TO SEE HER ON MY OWN OH WHY 
IT'S A BIT PERSONAL LEWIS OH 
O. K. WELL GIVE ME A SHOUT IF YOU NEED ANYTHING O. K. 
I'VE HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH INSOMNIA SINCE THE ACCIDENT 
THOSE WERE GREAT AT FIRST BUT LATELY I'VE GONE OFF THEM 
THEY KNOCK ME OUT COLD I WAKE UP IN A TOTAL DAZE WELL THAT'S NOT A NICE FEELING 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN I'M NOT REALLY MY COUSIN'S STILL WITH ME HELPING ME SETTLE IN 
ALL RIGHT LET ME KNOW HOW YOU GET ON ONCE HE LEAVES 
I WILL THANKS THESE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE STRONG DO YOU KNOW WHY YOUR G. P. PRESCRIBED THEM IN PARTICULAR 
OH HE DIDN'T MY COUSIN GOT THEM FOR ME YOUR COUSIN YEAH 
HE'S GOT SOME MAD IDEA THEY'LL HELP ME WALK AGAIN WHAT 
HE DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET 
RIGHT AND HOW DOES HE FIGURE THAT SLEEPING PILLS ARE GOING TO HELP YOU WALK 
APPARENTLY THEY GAVE THESE TO SOME PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN IN A COMA FOR YEARS 
AND THEY SUDDENLY WOKE UP THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHY WOULD YOU GIVE SLEEPING PILLS TO SOMEONE 
TO HELP WAKE THEM UP I DON'T KNOW BUT APPARENTLY IT'S TRUE 
OH HANG ON A MINUTE I REMEMBER THIS 
THEY DID SOME TESTS THIS WAS IN SOUTH AFRICA YES YES 
WELL THOSE PATIENTS WERE IN A PERMANENT VEGETATIVE STATE 
IT HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH PARALYSIS 
THESE PILLS WON'T MIRACULOUSLY CURE THE DAMAGE TO YOUR SPINE 
I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHY I WAS TAKING THEM 
LOOK AS LONG AS THEY WERE HELPING ME SLEEP THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY HARM IN HUMOURING LEWIS 
YOUR COUSIN YES HE CAN BE A BIT A BIT OBSESSIVE ABOUT MY HEALTH 
SO SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER JUST TO GO ALONG WITH HIM YOU SHOULD NEVER TAKE MEDICATION 
WITHOUT RUNNING IT PAST YOUR G. P. YOU COULD DO SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT 
I STOPPED TAKING THEM ABOUT A WEEK AGO AND 
WELL EVER SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN FEELING KIND OF ANXIOUS 
I MEAN IT COULD JUST BE THE MOVE OR YOU COULD HAVE DEVELOPED A DEPENDENCY 
THREE MONTHS IS QUITE A LONG TIME I'VE BEEN GETTING THE SHAKES TOO O. K. 
LET'S HAVE A THINK ABOUT PRESCRIBING YOU SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MILDER 
UNTIL WE CAN COME UP WITH A MORE LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR YOUR INSOMNIA AND IN THE MEANTIME 
PLEASE DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PRESCRIBED BY YOUR COUSIN 
IF HE'S NOT QUALIFIED HE'S GOT NO BUSINESS GIVING YOU MEDICAL ADVICE HOWEVER WELL INTENTIONED IT IS 
THANK YOU 
ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE NEW PRESCRIPTION JUST LET ME KNOW 
THANK YOU I CAN DO IT LEWIS 
O. K. EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT YEAH 
ANYTHING I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT NO SO WHAT'S THIS NEW PRESCRIPTION 
IT'S NOTHING 
OH JULIA CAN I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU ABOUT THE NEW SURGERY CAN IT WAIT IT WON'T TAKE A SECOND 
WHEN I WAS AT UNI SOME OF MY FRIENDS WERE IN A REALLY BAD WAY COS OF ALL THE STRESS AND ANXIETY 
ONE GIRL GOT SO DEPRESSED SHE COULDN'T LEAVE HER ROOM FOR SIX MONTHS 
THEN I READ ABOUT CCBT AND I THOUGHT THAT IT 
WHAT CCBT COMPUTERISED COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY IT'S A SELF HELP PROGRAMME 
IT'S SUPERVISED BUT DONE ON A COMPUTER 
WITH MULTI MEDIA ANIMATIONS VOICEOVERS 
IT'S LIKE A P. S. THREE FOR DEPRESSIVES 
ERM A COMPUTER GAME I'VE GIVEN YOU YOUR AREAS MELODY 
YEAH BUT BLUE SKY THINKING NOT NOW MELODY JUST WRITE IT DOWN 
OH SO MUCH FOR THE BLUE SKY SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO ME 
YEAH IT IS NOT THAT IT MATTERS SHE WASN'T LISTENING ANYWAY 
WELL IF SHE DOESN'T APPRECIATE IT WHAT'S THE POINT 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU EVEN DISCUSSED IT WITH HER WHY 
YOU ONLY MET HER THIS MORNING YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HER SHE'S A DOCTOR LEWIS 
OF COURSE SHE SAID THE TRIALS DON'T MEAN ANYTHING SHE'S COVERING HER BACK I'VE LEFT MY BAG 
IN THE CAR I'LL GET IT IN A MINUTE WHETHER YOU WALK AGAIN OR NOT 
IT MEANS NOTHING TO THAT DOCTOR SHE'S NOT GOING TO RISK HER REPUTATION FOR YOU IS SHE 
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS HERE 
LEWIS 
ANYWAY THERE'S NO POINT I STOPPED TAKING THE PILLS OVER A WEEK AGO 
WHAT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME I JUST FORGOT 
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD IT IS FOR ME TO GET THOSE PILLS NO 
YOU CAN'T STOP NOW TANYA THE PILLS ARE STARTING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
YOU SAID YOU FELT SOMETHING IN YOUR LEG 
YOU DID DIDN'T YOU 
TANYA NO 
THEN WHY DID YOU SAY YOU DID I DON'T KNOW 
WHEN YOU GET OBSESSED WITH SOMETHING IT'S REALLY HARD TO TALK TO YOU 
SO YOU LIED TO ME 
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU 
IT'S NO BIG DEAL YES IT IS NO IT ISN'T 
HONESTLY SOMETIMES I THINK ALL THIS IS MORE ABOUT YOU THAN ME 
THAT'S NOT FAIR I'M ALWAYS THERE WHEN YOU NEED ME NO YOU'RE THERE WHETHER I NEED YOU OR NOT 
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD IT IS FOR ME TO MAKE THIS MOVE 
I HAVE NIGHTMARES ABOUT LIVING ON MY OWN TRAPPED IN THIS CHAIR HELPLESS 
IT WOULD BE SO EASY FOR ME TO GIVE UP AND LET YOU DO EVERYTHING THEN 
LET ME NO IF I DO I'LL END UP LIKE AUNT DOROTHY IT'S NOT THE SAME 
I MAY NOT HAVE ALZHEIMER'S BUT I'M JUST AS DEPENDENT ON YOU AS SHE WAS 
YOU WON'T EVEN LET ME UNDRESS MYSELF WHEN I HAVE A BATH 
I ONLY DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S HOW DO YOU THINK THAT MAKES ME FEEL 
YOU DON'T RESPECT MY SPACE YOU MAKE ALL MY DECISIONS FOR ME YOU TELL ME WHAT DRUGS TO TAKE 
I DO RESPECT YOU NO YOU DON'T YOU'RE ALL OVER ME LEWIS 
I'VE ALWAYS DONE EVERYTHING I COULD TO HELP YOU 
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO EVERYTHING FOR ME 
AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE I'LL NEVER LEARN TO MANAGE ON MY OWN 
SOMETIMES I WISH YOU WOULD JUST GET OUT OF MY LIFE 
AND LET ME GET ON WITH IT 
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT 
IS THIS A GOOD TIME ACTUALLY NO 
THIS REALLY IS A GOOD IDEA AND IT'S SO SIMPLE 
MISSED APPOINTMENTS ARE A REAL PROBLEM WITH STUDENTS RIGHT NOT JUST THE STUDENTS 
EXACTLY AND MOST OF THEM SPEND PRACTICALLY ALL OF THEIR TIME ON THEIR MOBILE PHONES 
SO WE SAVE OURSELVES A WHOLE LOT OF TIME AND MONEY BY BUILDING A MOBILE RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM 
BUILDING A WHAT A MOBILE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STUDENTS 
YOU SEE WE GET ALL OF THEIR NUMBERS AND PUT THEM IN THE COMPUTER AND THEN WE CAN TEXT THEM REMINDERS 
ABOUT APPOINTMENTS AND HEALTH ISSUES AND ALL THAT SORT OF 
HOW CAN A COMPUTER 
LOOK NEVER MIND JUST WRITE IT DOWN WILL YOU MELODY 
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE DOING HOUSE CALLS OH YEAH 
PLEASE LEAVE YOUR MESSAGE AFTER THE TONE
