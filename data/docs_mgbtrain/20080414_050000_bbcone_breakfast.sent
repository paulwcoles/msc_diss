NOT YOU WILL STAY DRY BUT WE HAVE 
GOT A BIT OF ORGANISED RAIN IN THE 
SOUTH EAST OF SCOTLAND AT THE 
MOMENT ONES THAT CLEARS THE WAY 
HERE AND IN NORTHERN IRELAND WE 
WILL PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER DAY 
ONES THAT CLEARS THE WAY ONCE 
STRETCHING UP TO EAST YORKSHIRE AND 
EAST OF THE PENNINES MAYBE A 
LITTLE BIT OF SLEET ON THE HIGHER 
GROUND 
NOT A BAD AFTERNOON TO COME FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND EITHER HEADING 
BACK ACROSS THE IRISH SEA TO PARTS 
OF WALES YES IT'S GOING TO BE A 
BIT OF A LOTTERY PERHAPS FEWER

INVESTIGATIONS ARE UNDER WAY AFTER 
THE DISCOVERY OF A BODY BELIEVED TO 
THE BEAT THAT OF THE MISSING T. V. 
CHILDREN'S PRESENTER MARK SPEIGHT 
BELIEVED TO BE THAT WHAT MORE 
CAN YOU TELL US 
THE OFFICIAL 
EXPLANATION IS MUCH THE SAME AS WAS 
AVAILABLE SHORTLY AFTER THE BODY 
WAS DISCOVERED WE KNOW THAT A BODY 
WAS FOUND IN A REMOTE AREA OF 
PADDINGTON STATION IT HAD NOT BEEN 
HIT BY A TRAIN AND THE POLICE ARE 
TREATING THE CAUSE OF DEATH AS 
UNEXPLAINED THEY SAID AT THE TIME 
THAT THEY BELIEVED THE BODY TO BE 
THAT OF MARK SPEIGHT WHO HAS BEEN 
MISSING FOR ALMOST A WEEK 
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THAT BODY 
HAS NOT BEEN FORMALLY IDENTIFIED 
YET SO THERE IS PRESUMABLY A VERY 
DIFFICULT MOMENT COME IN FOR THE 
FAMILY THE FAMILY 
BE IN 
NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS THE BODY OF 
MARK SPEIGHT THEY HAVE ISSUED A 
STATEMENT OVERNIGHT SAYING THAT 
THEY WILL SORELY MISS A WONDERFUL 
SON WONDERFUL BROTHER AND THEY 
HAVE ALSO ASKED THAT AT THIS VERY 
DIFFICULT TIME THEY BE LEFT ALONE 
TO GRIEVE AFTER THEY HAVE 
IDENTIFIED THE BODY WE EXPECT THAT 
THERE WILL BE POST MORTEM WHICH 
SHOULD SHED SOME CLEAR LIGHT ON 
PRECISELY WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF 
DEATH ALREADY THIS MORNING IN THE 
NEWSPAPERS WE ARE SEEING QUITE 
LARGE AMOUNT OF SPECULATION A 
NUMBER OF THEM ARE SAYING THAT THEY 
BELIEVE MARK SPEIGHT WAS FOUND 
HANGED HERE SOME GOING AS FAR AS 
SAYING THAT THEY BELIEVE HE TOOK 
HIS OWN LIFE 
THERE IS BIT OF NEW CRIME WAVE 
GOING ON IN THE COUNTRYSIDE NOT 
THE SORT YOU MIGHT EXPECT THIEVES 
ARE STEALING OIL USED TO FIRE 
HEATING SYSTEMS FROM STORAGE TANKS 
BEHIND PEOPLE'S HOUSES THE RISING 
COST OF OIL IS MAKING THIS CRIME 
INCREASINGLY ATTRACTIVE GOOD 
MORNING 
GOOD MORNING YES HERE IN MORNING SUFFOLK THIS IS A GROWING PROBLEM 
JUST OVER THERE IS A VILLAGE AND 
WE HAVE COME DOWN THIS COUNTRY 
TRACK TO THIS HOUSE HERE ONE OF 
MANY WHICH HAS BEEN RECENTLY 
TARGETED THE POLICE SAY THIS IS ON 
THE INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE PRICE 
OF OIL WHICH IS GOING UP THIS 
TANK HOLDS ABOUT ONE THOUSAND LITRES IF 
YOU HAVE FILLED IT UP LAST YEAR IT 
WOULD HAVE COST ABOUT TWO HUNDRED BUT NOW 
IT WILL COST OVER FIVE HUNDRED THE THING 
IS THAT PEOPLE DO NOT EVEN THOUGH 
THEY HAVE BEEN TARGETED 
WHEN THIS LADY'S HEATING STOPPED 
SHE ASSUMED HER BOILER WAS ON THE 
BLINK AND CALLED OUT THE ENGINEER 
BUT HER SISTER WAS FINE THE 
PROBLEM WAS OUT HERE AN EMPTY 
PROBLEM WAS OUT HERE AN EMPTY TANK TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WORTH OF OIL HAD BEEN 
STOLEN STOLEN IT NEVER OCCURRED TO US THAT 
SOMEBODY WOULD STEAL OUR OIL IT 
WAS A COMPLETE SHOCK IT MEANT WE 
HAD NO HOT WATER OR HEATING UNTIL 
WE HAD SOME MORE OR OIL DELIVERED 
AND IT'S VERY INCONVENIENT AND A 
LITTLE BIT CREAKY BUT SOMEBODY HAD 
COME DOWN HERE AND STOLEN IT DOWN 
THE ROAD THE VILLAGE PUB HAS BEEN 
TARGETED TOO NOW PEOPLE HERE ARE 
GETTING JUMPY 
WE HAVE HAD PEOPLE 
COMING IN TRYING TO BUY EXTRA 
LOCKS TO SECURE THEIR GATES AND SO 
FORTH 
IN NEARBY NORFOLK ALMOST A FORTH HOME A DAY WAS HIT LAST MONTH 
AMONG THEM THIS MAN'S 
NOW THEY 
HAVE BOTH GOT CAPS IT IS NOT GREAT 
SECURITY BUT AT LEAST IT'S SOME 
KIND OF DETERRENT 
THIEVES HAVE 
STRUCK HERE MORE THAN ONCE AND IT 
HAS COST HIM MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND WE WE THOUGHT WE HAD BETTER HAVE A LOOK 
AT THE LEVEL OF THE OIL AND THEN 
WE DECIDED THAT HALF A TANK HAD 
GONE TWELVE HUNDRED LITRES HAD GONE A COUPLE 
OF WEEKS AND IT CLICKED WITH US 
THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE NOT QUITE 
RIGHT 
THERE IS A LOT OF INGENUITY 
EMPLOYED WE HAVE FOUND VEHICLES 
WITH CONCEALED TANKS AND PUMPING 
APPARATUS AND SO ON IF THEY CAN 
APPROACH IN DARKNESS IF IT IS 
CONCEALED FROM THE ROADS AND IF IT 
IS POORLY LIT AND THE THIEVES WILL 
BE ATTRACTED TO IT 
NOW PEOPLE ARE 
KEEPING AN EYE OUT AND LOCKING UP 
THEIR OR OIL AS I SAID EARLIER 
POLICE SAY LOCK UP YOUR TENT PUT 
UP SECURITY LIGHTS AND ALSO AND 
THIS IS NOT THE EASIEST TRY TO 
MOVE IT TO A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN 
SEE IT L. WILL JUST GIVE YOU SOME 
FIGURES THERE ARE ONLY NINE 
THERE WERE ONLY NINE REPORTS OF 
THEFT LAST YEAR IN THIS PART OF THE 
WORLD AND THERE HAVE BEEN NINETEEN SO 
FAR THE SAME PATTERN IS BEING SEEN 
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY GOOD 
MORNING WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
DIFFERENTLY SINCE THE TAG WAS 
TARGETED 
BASICALLY WE'RE JUST TARGETED CHECKING OUR OR ILL ALL THE TIME 
AND MAKING SURE WE KNOW EXACTLY 
WHAT LEVEL IT IS ON JUST 
MONITORING IT REALLY CHICKEN 
OUR OIL CHICKEN OUR OIL 
YOU DID 
NOT CLAIM ON INSURANCE WHY NOT 
CHECKING OUR OIL OUR EXCESS WAS 
QUITE HIGH SO ON THIS OCCASION IT 
WAS NOT WORTH CLAIMING BECAUSE IT 
WOULD HAVE AFFECTED OUR INSURANCE 
NEXT YEAR WE CHOSE NOT TO CLAIM 
IT DIDN'T SEEM WORTH IT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WILL BE THINKING I NEVER 
KNEW THIS TYPE OF THING IS GOING ON 
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ADVICE 
IT IS 
SURPRISING AND IT DOESN'T NORMALLY 
HAPPEN BUT YES JUST KEEP A 
LOOKOUT WASH YOUR OIL TANKS AND

VANISH FROM THE LEADERBOARD 
MANCHESTER UNITED ARE EDGING CLOSER 
TO RETAINING THEIR TITLE AFTER 
BEATING ARSENAL TWO TO ONE AT OLD TRAFFORD 
NOTHING LESS THAN A WIN WOULD HAVE 
KEPT ARSENAL'S SEASON ALIVE AND THE 
GUNNERS WENT AHEAD SHORTLY BEFORE 
THE BREAK OF WHAT WAS EITHER THE 
HAND OR HEAD OF A MANUAL AND A BY 
YOUR CHRISTIANA ZERO SCORED HIS FORTIETH 
OF THE SEASON THEN ARSENAL'S HOPES 
WERE ENDED BY THIS BY OWEN 
HARGREAVES HARGREAVES LIVERPOOL WON THREE TO ONE AGAINST BLACKBURN

STEVEN GERRARD SEEMS TO BE GETTING 
STRONGER HE GOT THROUGH THE 
DEFENCE TO OPEN THE SCORING THEN 
FERNANDO TORRES OPENED THE SECOND 
IN HIS THIRTIETH GOAL OF THE SEASON THE 
MANAGER IS NOT HAPPY APPARENTLY HE 
WAS FURIOUS WHEN HE FOUND OUT THAT 
NOT ONLY TOM HICKS AT INTERVIEWED 
JADE IN KLINSMANN FOR HIS JOB BUT 
ALSO RICK PARRY AND GEORGE GILLETT 
HAD MET HIM AS WELL 
I WAS 
SURPRISED TODAY ABOUT THINGS IN THE 
PRESS ABOUT MEETINGS MY IDEA IS TO 
TALK WITH THE BOARD AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IS 
GOING ON 
CELTIC FOURTEEN TO ONE AT MOTHERWELL THEY HAD 
ONLY ONE VICTORY FROM THE LAST SIX 
GAMES FOUR TO ONE CELTIC ARE FOUR 
POINTS BEHIND RANGERS BUT THEY 
HAVE PLAYED TWO MORE GAMES 
RANGERS BEAT PARTICK THISTLE

SEMI FINALS SEMI FINALS BRITAIN'S PROSPECTS FOR SWIMMING

FIVE DAYS WINNING THREE GOLD 
MEDALS TEN SILVER THEY FINISHED 
FIFTH IN THE TABLE AND THE U. S. A. WERE 
TOP TOP HARLEQUINS MOVED INTO SECOND PLACE 
AFTER WINNING THIRTY TWO TO SIX AT LEEDS LEEDS 
LOOK AS THOUGH THEY ARE CERTAINLY 
RELEGATED 
THAT IS JUST ABOUT IT FROM ME I 
WILL BE BACK LATER 
IT WAS A GAP YEAR ADVENTURE TO 
ECUADOR WHICH HAS ENDED IN TRAGEDY 
FOR TEENAGE GIRLS AND THEIR TOUR 
LEADER WAS KILLED ON SATURDAY THIS 
LADY TOOK PART IN A SIMILAR TRIP 
SIX YEARS AGO CHARLOTTE GOOD 
MORNING THIS IS A HORRIBLE WAY FOR 
AN ADVENTURE TO END WHEN YOU TOOK 
PART IT WAS WORTHWHILE 
YES CERTAINLY SOUTH AMERICA IS A 
RELATIVELY UNEXPLORED PART OF THE 
WORLD THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD WORK 
TO BE DONE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PART 
OF THE WORLD AND HIS GREAT THOSE 
PEOPLE GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE 
THAT 
HE WENT WITH VENTURECO THE THAT PEOPLE WHO RUN THE STRIP YES IT YES IT IS SPLIT UP INTO TWO PARTIES AND 
IT 
YES WE START IN QUITO IN A IT LANGUAGE PROGRAMME AND THEN YOU 
MOVE INTO YOUR VOLUNTEER WORK 
EVERY WEEK THE GROUP TRY TO REUNITE 
AND SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES THEN THEN THEY MOVE FROM THERE OUT TO THE 
COUNTRYSIDE YES 
YOU WENT ALONG COUNTRYSIDE YES THAT ROUTE YOURSELF 
I HAVE YES 
WHAT ARE THE ROADS LIKE 
THEY TEND 
TO BE A LITTLE BIT TREACHEROUS AT 
TIMES WITHIN THE CITIES OBVIOUSLY 
THEY ARE MORE DEVELOPED BUT THERE 
ARE PARTS OF THE TRIP WHERE THE 
ROADS ARE NOT PARTICULARLY SAFE 
WERE YOU WORRIED ABOUT YOUR SAFETY 
WHEN YOU WERE THERE 
A THINK THERE 
IS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT OF WORRY IN 
THE BACK OF YOUR MIND YOU DO FEEL 
VERY ISOLATED AND FAR FROM THE 
MAJOR CITIES BUT I THINK IT IS 
PART OF THE ADVENTURE IN ANY EVENT 
IT IS SO SAD THEY WERE ONLY TWENTY 
MINUTES FROM THEIR DESTINATIONS SO 
THE MORE HAZARDOUS PART OF THE 
JOURNEY WAS BEHIND THEM WASN'T IT 
YES WHEN YOU COME THROUGH THE 
MOUNTAINS THAT IS PROBABLY THE 
MOST TREACHEROUS PART OF THE 
JOURNEY 
IT GIVES A LOT OF PEOPLE JOURNEY PAUSE FOR THOUGHT WHEN SOMETHING 
LIKE THIS HAPPENS A LOT OF PARENTS 
WILL BE THINKING SHOULD I TRY TO 
PERSUADE 
NOT TO GO ON A 
TRIP LIKE THIS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY 
TO THEM 
PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE 
DETERRED BY THIS ACCIDENT 
OBVIOUSLY IT IS VERY TRAGIC BUT 
AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THAT FOR ANY 
STUDENT OR YOUNG PERSON THAT 
OPPORTUNITY SLIGHTLY OUT WAYS THE 
DANGERS UNFORTUNATELY IT HAS TO BE 
PUT DOWN TO AN ACCIDENT AND NO 
OTHER SAFETY MEASURES COULD HAVE 
PREPARED FOR IT 
WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE HEAD OF 
VENTURECO THE COMPANY WHICH 
ORGANISED THE TOUR TO ECUADOR 
THE FIRST MAN FORMALLY NAMED BY 
PORTUGUESE POLICE AS A SUSPECT IN 
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MADELEINE 
MCCANN SAYS HE WILL SUE ELEVEN BRITISH 
NEWSPAPERS AND A TELEVISION STATION 
FOR LIBEL 
HER ROBERT MUIR RAT THIRTY FOUR LIVING NEAR 
THE HOLIDAY APARTMENT DENIES ANY 
INVOLVEMENT IN HER DISAPPEARANCE 
AND HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO FIGHT A 
CASE LIKE THIS HE IS TAKING ON TEN 
NEWSPAPERS AND TELEVISION STATION 
IT IS BECOMING THE TREND TO SUE A 
LARGE NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS THE 
MCCANN'S DID IT AND MADE A LOT OF 
MONEY WHAT ROBERT MUIR RAT IS 
DOING A SIMILAR IF HE DOES SUCCEED 
AGAINST ALL ELEVEN DEFENDANTS IT WILL 
BE A RECORD FOR THE LIBEL COURTS IN 
THIS COUNTRY 
ON WHAT GROUNDS DO 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A LIBEL CASE 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS 
THAT OR MADE ABOUT HIM WHICH COULD 
HAVE BEEN REPORTED PROPERLY AND 
RESPONSIBLY IN NEUTRAL WAY WHAT 
HAPPENED HERE ROBERT MURAT IS 
MAKING THE POINT THAT THEY OVER 
SENSATIONALISED WHAT WAS SAID AND 
IN SOME CASES FABRICATED WHAT WAS 
SAID ABOUT HIM THEREFORE HE IS 
ENTITLED TO DAMAGES FOR THE DAMAGE 
TO HIS REPUTATION TRADITIONALLY TRADITIONALLY WHAT WOULD BE THE DEFENCE AND A 
LIBEL CASE FROM THESE NEWSPAPERS 
EITHER PUBLIC INTEREST PUBLIC 
INTEREST IN WHAT WAS AND IS 
SENSATIONAL CRIME THE PEOPLE WHO 
ARE THE SUSPECTS IN THAT CASE AND 
THAT IS NOT ONLY ROBERT MURAT ALSO 
THERE IS DEFENCE OF NEUTRAL 
REPORTAGE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
PROVE THE UNDERLYING FACTS YOU 
DON'T HAVE TO SAY WHY HE IS 
SUSPECT YOU ONLY HAVE TO SHOW THAT 
THE POLICE SAY HE IS THAT IS 
IMPORTANT TO SHOW THAT YOU CANNOT 
ADOPT THE ALLEGATION YOU CANNOT 
SAY HE IS GUILTY HE FEELS A NUMBER 
OF THE NEWSPAPERS WENT SO FAR TO 
IMPLY GUILT ON HIS PART 
THE FACT 
HE LIVES IN PORTUGAL DOES THAT 
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE CASE NO NO THERE ARE A LOT OF LIBEL TOURISTS 
COME TO LONDON TO SUE FOR LIBEL 
HIS SCHOOL FRIENDS OBVIOUSLY KNOW 
HIM FROM HERE SO HIS REPUTATION 
CAN BE HARMED IN THIS COUNTRY AS 
WELL AS IN PORTUGAL 
THIS IS BREAKFAST 
INVESTIGATORS IN ECUADOR TRYING TO 
ESTABLISH THE CAUSE OF CRASH IN 
WHICH FIVE YOUNG BRITISH WOMEN WERE 
KILLED KILLED A POST MORTEM WILL BE CARRIED OUT 
ON WHAT IS THOUGHT TO BE THE BODY 
OF THE MISSING T. V. PRESENTER MARK 
SPEIGHT WHICH WAS FOUND AT 
PADDINGTON STATION 
ALSO COMING OFF IT IS VERY 
IMPRESSIVE THESE ONES YOU HAVE TO 
STRUGGLE WITH AT TIMES 
CAN YOU POT UNTIL YOU STOP FEELING 
STRESSED WE LOOK AT HOW THE 
JAPANESE ARE MAKING GAME OUT OF STAYING CALM WITH THESE THINGS 
DECLAN WILL BE LOOKING AT OPTIONS 
IF WE GET INTO TROUBLE PAYING OFF 
MORTGAGES FIRST THE WEATHER 
SPRING IS DEFINITELY IN THE AIR 
HERE IN THE BLUE PETER GARDEN 
THERE IS SOME LOVELY SUNSHINE 
ALTHOUGH IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT 
IT WILL LAST WE HAVE GOT THAT 
CLASSIC APRIL SCENARIO OF SUNSHINE 
AND SHOWERS ONE OR TWO AREAS MAY 
ESCAPE RELATIVELY DRY I THINK TODAY 
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD AND 
PERSISTENT RAIN JUST CLEARING 
SOUTH EAST SCOTLAND AT THE MOMENT 
THAT WILL BE DRIFTING INTO THE 
NORTH OF ENGLAND OVER THE NEXT HOUR 
OR SO TEMPERATURES JUST HOVERING 
AROUND THE FREEZING MARK FOR ONE OR 
TWO OF US 
IN THE SOUTH EAST WE WILL SEE SOME 
FREQUENT SHARP SLOW MOVING 
SHOWERS TODAY IT WILL BE A BIT 
HIT AND MISS THEY WILL BE 
EXTENDING PIN TO YORKSHIRE AND 
THEN HE SHOULD FURTHER NORTH IN 
SCOTLAND IT SHOULD BE A BETTER DAY 
DRIER AND BRIGHTER UP INTO 
SCOTLAND UP INTO YORKSHIRE 
HEADING BACK ACROSS THE IRISH SEA 
TOWARDS WALES WE CAN SEE THOSE 
SHOWERS BUT I THINK IN THE 
SHELTERED SOUTH WEST OF WALES AND 
THE SOUTH WEST GENERALLY THE 
SHOWERS SHOULD BE FEW AND FAR 
BETWEEN BY LATE AFTERNOON 
IF YOU GET THOSE SHARP SHOWERS 
WITH THE HAIL AND THERE THUNDERS 
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP FOR TIME WITH THE HAIL AND THUNDER 
WE COULD SEE A TOUCH OF FROST IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES OVERNIGHT TONIGHT 
THERE WILL BE A BAND OF LIGHT RAIN 
STEADILY DRIFTING SOUTH TOMORROW 
GENERALLY SPEAKING DRAW THE LINE 
FROM THE M. FOUR CORRIDOR OR AND IT 
SHOULD BE DRY AND SUNNY BENEATH 
THAT LINE CORRIDOR 
DECLAN IS THE LEEDS LOOKING AT THE 
PROBLEM OF REPOSSESSIONS YES WE 
ARE AT THE OFFICE THIS MORNING OF 
THE CONSUMER CREDIT COUNSELLING 
SERVICE THE BIGGEST CHARITY 
DEALING WITH DEBT PROBLEMS IN THE 
COUNTRY THIS IS THEIR CENTRE FOR 
GIVING ADVICE TO PEOPLE WHO THINK 
THEY MAY BE IN DANGER OF LOSING 
THEIR HOMES AND THE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING REPOSSESSED IS 
RISING TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE LOST THEIR 
HOMES LAST YEAR THE HIGHEST SINCE 
NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH PUSHED UP THE COSTS 
OF BORROWING MONEY THERE IS A 
HELPLINE NUMBER FOR HERE WE WILL 
GIVE IT TO YOU AT THE END AGAIN 
HERE IS THE NUMBER I WILL TELL 
YOU THAT AGAIN AT THE END L. 
MENTIONED THE RISING NUMBER OF 
REPOSSESSIONS BEHIND EVERY ONE OF 
THOSE YOU WILL FIND AN INDIVIDUAL 
STORY OF MISERY AND STRESS ONE MAN 
MISSED HIS MORTGAGE PAYMENTS WHEN 
HE FELL ILL AND HE HAD TO TAKE 
TIME OFF WORK IT DID NOT TAKE LONG 
BEFORE HE DISCOVERED THAT HIS HOME 
WAS ACTUALLY UNDER THREAT 
APPARENTLY THE LENDERS HAD 
REPOSSESSED THE HOUSE AND APPLIED 
TO THE COURTS FOR SIX MONTHS I 
HAD BEEN RECEIVING MAIL AT FIRST 
I WAS TRYING TO DEAL WITH EVERY 
PIECE OF MAIL UNTIL SUCH TIME WHEN 
I WAS JUST EXHAUSTED I COULDN'T 
COPE I WAS INUNDATED WITH IT I 
LEFT MANY OF THEM UNOPENED AND THE 
CASE FOR MY HOUSE REPOSSESSION HAD 
GONE THROUGH THE COURTS BY DEFAULT 
WITHOUT ME EVEN DEFENDING IT AS A 
CONSEQUENCE OF THIS BY DECEMBER 
TWO THOUSAND SIX A COURT BAILIFF FROM THE 
GLOUCESTER CAUGHT KNOCKED ON THE 
DOOR AND SAID I AM SERVING YOU 
WITH THESE PAPERS YOUR HOUSE IS AN 
EVICTION ORDER PETER IF YOU 
THINK YOU'RE IN TROUBLE WITH YOUR 
MORTGAGE WHAT SHOULD YOU DO 
THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS 
TO SEEK HELP THE PROBLEM IS NOT 
GOING TO GO AWAY BY ITSELF WE ARE 
HERE TO HELP 
ABSOLUTELY THE WORST 
THING TO DO IS TO IGNORE IT INDEED INDEED OVER HERE AND HIS A REPRESENTATIVE 
OF THE CONSUMER CREDIT COUNSELLING 
SERVICE ALSO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OF THE YORKSHIRE BUILDING SOCIETY 
THERE IS LOT THAT CAN BE DONE 
JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE MISSED 
PAYMENTS IT IS NOT PRE ORDAINED 
THAT YOU WILL BE REPOSSESSED NO NO MOST LENDERS WILL BE QUITE HAPPY TO 
NEGOTIATE AN ARRANGEMENT TO CLEAR 
THEIR ARREARS BUT THE SOONER 
PEOPLE TALK TO US THE SMALLER THE 
ARREARS ARE AND THE QUICKER THEY 
CAN CLEAR THEM THERE IS A LOT THAT 
CAN BE DONE BUT PEOPLE NEED TO ACT 
QUICKLY 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO SAY QUICKLY THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE EVERYONE 
KEEPING THEIR PROPERTY THERE WILL 
BE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE WILL LOSE 
THEIR HOMES 
ABSOLUTELY ABOUT ONE 
FIFTH OF THE PEOPLE WE TALK TO HAVE 
NO CHOICE BUT TO TRY TO SELL 
PROPERTY THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY 
CANNOT SUSTAIN THE MORTGAGE IAN IAN YOU HAVE GOT SOME TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MORTGAGE 
HOLDERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE 
PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS NOW A 
SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE MORTGAGE 
LOANS COSTS HAVE RISEN SHARPLY 
THIS IS TRUE BUT LET'S PUT THIS 
INTO CONTEXT ALTHOUGH THE PROBLEMS 
ARE RISING A LITTLE BIT THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE CAN STILL AFFORD 
THEIR MORTGAGES AND WILL STILL BE 
ABLE TO EVEN THOUGH PAYMENTS MAY 
GO UP A BIT L. WOULD ECHO WHAT HAS 
BEEN SAID WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE 
POSSIBLY CAN TO KEEP PEOPLE IN 
THEIR HOMES BUT THE VITAL THING IS 
THAT THEY GET IN TOUCH WITH US AS 
QUICK AS POSSIBLE 
YOU SAY YOU WILL 
DO AS MUCH AS YOU CAN BUT THERE 
WILL BE PEOPLE WATCHING WHO WILL 
KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN 
DIFFICULTY AND THE MORTGAGE 
LENDERS HAVE BEEN PRETTY QUICK TO 
GO FOR REPOSITION IN SOME CASES I I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR THE YORKSHIRE 
BUILDING SOCIETY AND WE WILL DO 
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP PEOPLE IN 
THEIR HOMES MOST PEOPLE ARE 
GETTING INTO DIFFICULTIES FOR 
SHORT TERM REASONS WE WILL BEAR 
WITH THEM WE WILL MAKE AGREEMENTS 
WITH THEM AND IF THEY STICK TO 
THOSE WE WILL KEEP THEM IN THEIR 
HOMES 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS HOMES THAT PEOPLE DO TALK TO SOMEBODY AND 
TAKE ADVICE WHETHER IT IS THEIR 
LENDER OR A CHARITY LIKE OURSELVES 
IF THEY DO SOMETHING EVERYONE WILL 
DO WHAT THEY CAN TO KEEP THEM 
LIVING IN THEIR PROPERTY 
I WANT TO 
GET THAT PHONE NUMBER IN AGAIN NOW 
I AM SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT 
HERE IT IS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DECLAN ARE 
YOU FEELING STRESSED WE MAY HAVE A 
LITTLE SOMETHING THAT COULD 
INTEREST YOU THIS COMES FROM JAPAN 
IT IS A TECHNOLOGICAL EQUIVALENT OF 
THIS BUT I DON'T THINK ANYTHING 
CAN BEAT A LITTLE BIT OF BUBBLE 
WRAP BUT THIS NEVER WEARS OUT 
THAT IS THE ONLY THING WE WILL BE 
GETTING THE THOUGHTS OF A 
PSYCHOTHERAPIST IN A MOMENT BUT 
HERE IS 
WHEN WE TOOK 
THIS FOR A ROAD TEST 
IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A RELIEF A 
LITTLE BIT OF BUTTERFLIES ALMOST 
LIKE SOMETHING EXCITING'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN 
IT IS QUITE SATISFYING HAPPEN IT'S GOOD FUN 
NOT AS SATISFYING KNOW I PREFER 
THE BUBBLE WRAP 
I LIKE THIS YEAH 
CAN I KEEP THIS 
THESE ONES YOU 
HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH SOMETIMES 
POPPING THEM IS A BIT FRUSTRATING 
YEAH IT'S GOOD 
THAT'S WHAT THEY 
THOUGHT ON THE STREET JOINING US 
NOW A PSYCHOTHERAPIST SHE IS 
WATCHING US WITH GREAT INTEREST 
NOT WATCHING ANALYSING WELL WELL ANALYSE THIS WHY DO WE FEEL WE 
HAVE TO DO THIS KIND OF THING WELL WELL IT IS A VERY NEAT TASK ORIENTED 
KIND OF ACTIVITY THE INTERESTING 
THING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE 
IS THAT YOU ARE GUARANTEED TO GET A 
LITTLE POP WITH THE BUBBLE WRAP 
YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT WHICH ONES ARE 
STILL LIVE AS IT WERE AND THERE 
IS A GREAT THRILL IN FINDING THE 
ONE THAT IS 
AND ALSO WITH THE 
BUBBLE WRAP THING SOME OF THEM 
DON'T POP AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT AND WHEN YOU GET ONE THAT 
DOES THERE IS A HUGE SATISFYING 
RELEASE WITH THIS ONE YOU GET TO 
CLICKS BEFORE YOU GET IT MORE 
SATISFYING NOISE 
THIS IS RATHER 
LIKE DRINKING DECAFFEINATED COFFEE 
REALLY 
IF YOU SAY SO 
IT DOES THE REALLY JOB BUT ONLY HALF WAY 
YES IT IS 
NOT THE FULL MONTY THAT YOU WOULD 
GET HERE 
WE HAVE HAD THEM ALL 
MORNING AND EVERYBODY IS REALLY 
IRRITATED BUT IT IS ADDICTIVE WHY 
DO WE DO THIS WHY DO WE FIDDLE 
WHY DO WE TWIDDLE WITH PENS 
IT IS 
ALL ABOUT ANXIETY AND STRESS WE 
CRAVE ORDER AND RITUAL AND 
REASSURANCE SO WHEN YOU WANT TO 
SUE SOMEONE THAT IS DISTRESSED SO 
YOU PERHAPS STROKE A CHILD WHEN 
THEY ARE DISTRESSED AND AS YOU GET 
OLDER YOU TURN TO THINGS LIKE 
WORRY BEADS OR YOU MIGHT TWIDDLE 
YOUR HAIR OR BITE YOUR FINGERNAILS 
THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE DO WE NOW 
MIND IS AGITATED WE ACTUALLY TURN 
TO PHYSICAL COMFORT TO SOOTHE 
OURSELVES 
SHOULD YOU STOP YOURSELF OURSELVES DOING IT ARE YOU GIVING PEOPLE 
MESSAGES 
IF THEY NOTICE YOU DOING MESSAGES IT THEN THEY WILL KNOW THAT YOU'RE 
AGITATED ABOUT SOMETHING THEY 
MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU 
YOURSELF ARE PERHAPS DOING IT AS A 
SUBCONSCIOUS RELEASE SO YOU MAY 
NOT BE ABLE TO CATCH YOURSELF DOING 
IT SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT BE 
TWIDDLING YOUR HAIR FOR SOME TIME 
BEFORE YOU NOTICE BUT IF YOU DO 
CATCH YOURSELF IF YOU BRING IT TO 
CONSCIOUSNESS THEN YES THAT IS 
THE MOMENT WHEN YOU SHOULD ASK 
YOURSELF I WONDER WHAT IT IS THAT 
I AM WORRIED ABOUT IF YOU DID NOT 
GET INVOLVED IN A DISPLACEMENT 
ACTIVITY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN YOU 
WOULD BECOME INCREDIBLY 
AND ANXIOUS YOU WOULD BE 
UNPLEASANT TO BE AROUND SO SO ACTUALLY THOSE DISPLACEMENTS EVEN 
IF THEY ARE ANNOYING ARE QUITE A 
GOOD THING 
THEY MAKE IT MORE 
BEARABLE FOR YOU TO BE YOURSELF 
AND FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO BE AROUND 
YOU YES 
WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE THE 
REAL DEAL 
OH YES 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU 
THINK IS THE BEST WAY TO COMBAT 
STRESS 
YES WHAT DO YOU DO STRESS SOMEBODY SAID WHAT YOU NEED TO DO 
IS TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF AND THEN 
STAND ON THE BUBBLE WRAP AND PUPPET 
WITH YOUR TOES VERY THERAPEUTIC 
THESE ARE GOING TO SELL LIKE HOT 
CAKES AND THEN GATHER DUST IN

HOMEOWNERS COULD LOSE THEIR HOMES 
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COSTS OF 
MORTGAGES THIS STEMS FROM A CREDIT 
CRUNCH WHICH HAS PUSHED UP THE COST 
OF BORROWING IT HAS RESTRICTED THE 
AMOUNT OF MONEY LENDERS HAVE TO 
OFFER ON TO US SO THE PRIME 
MINISTER IS CALLING A MEETING OF 
THE LEADERS OF THE MAJOR LENDERS 
INCLUDING THE HALIFAX AND 
NATIONWIDE THEY WILL TALK ABOUT 
HOW YOU CAN GET MORE MONEY INTO THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET AND BRING DOWN 
THOSE MORTGAGE COSTS THE FEAR IS 
HIGHER MORTGAGE COSTS WILL BREAK 
HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE ALREADY 
STRETCHED TOO FAR MORE PEOPLE ARE 
LOSING THEIR HOMES THERE WERE TWENTY SEVEN 
REPOSSESSIONS LAST YEAR TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
REPOSSESSIONS THE HIGHER SINCE 
NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE IMPACT 
OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH THAT NUMBER 
OF REPOSSESSIONS IS EXPECTED TO 
RISE THERE ARE OVER ONE MILLION HOME 
OWNERS WHO FACE A BIG JUMP IN THEIR 
MORTGAGE BILLS THIS YEAR AS THEY 
ARE CHEAP DEALS RUN OUT IT IS NOT 
JUST HIGHER MORTGAGE COSTS IT IS 
HIGHER FOOD AND FUEL BILLS AND THAT 
IS SQUEEZING FAMILY FINANCES HARD 
IT IS THOUGHT THERE ARE ABOUT 
SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE IN DANGER OF FALLING 
INTO NEGATIVE EQUITY WHERE THE 
HOUSE IS LESS THAN THE VALUE OF THE 
MORTGAGE WE ARE SPENDING THE 
MORNING HERE AT THE CONSUMER CREDIT 
COUNSELLING CENTRE IN LEEDS THEY 
SPECIALISE IN HELPING PEOPLE WHO 
WERE HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH THEIR 
MORTGAGE THIS IS THEIR HELPLINE 
NUMBER 
WE WILL BE BACK HERE IN ABOUT FORTY 
MINUTES TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE WORK 
THEY ARE DOING 
ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST SENIOR 
JUDGES IS TO MEET GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS WHAT HE SAYS 
OUR FAILINGS IN NEW LAWS DESIGNED 
TO TACKLE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
ACCORDING TO THE TIMES NEWSPAPER 
SIR MARK POTTER SAYS LEGISLATION 
MEANT TO CURB VIOLENCE AND HOME AS 
DISCOURAGE MANY WOMEN FROM 
REPORTING UPON US BECAUSE IT COULD 
RESULT IN A JAIL SENTENCE 
THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY IN 
ZIMBABWE SAYS IT WILL GO TO COURT 
TO STOP THE RECOUNT IN THE 
ELECTIONS THE MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE WON SEATS IN THE 
BALLOT THEY HAVE ACCUSED THE 
GOVERNMENT OF TRYING TO RIG THE 
RESULT RESULT IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE THIRTEEN MILLION 
PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM HAY FEVER 
THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE YOU ARE 
TAKING THE WRONG MEDICINE FOR YOUR 
ALLERGY THE ROYAL PHARMACEUTICAL 
SOCIETY SAYS MORE THAN FIVE MILLION 
PEOPLE COULD EASE THEIR CONDITION 
IF THEY FOLLOWED THE RIGHT ADVICE 
AN UPDATE ON THE SIXTH MASAI WARRIORS 
WHO CAME TO RUN AND THE LONDON 
MARATHON TO RAISE MONEY FOR CHARITY 
PROJECT FOR THE VILLAGE IN TANZANIA 
THEY WERE ON BREAKFAST LAST WEEK AS 
PART OF THE PREPARATIONS ONE OF 
THEM HAVE TO DROP OUT BECAUSE HE 
WAS ILL THE OTHER FOR DIGNITY TO 
THE FINISH THEY DID IT IN JUST 
UNDER FIVE AND ONE HALF HOURS 
WE STRUGGLED BECAUSE WE HAVE FELT 
THE COLD AND THE PAIN BUT WHEN WE 
ARE RUNNING WE FEEL GOOD 
CONGRATULATIONS TO THEM THEY TOOK 
SO LONG BECAUSE THEY STOPPED TO 
DANCE FOR A LONG WAY 
THOSE ARE THE MAIN STORIES 
IN ABOUT TEN NIMITZ WILL BE TOM TO A 
REMARKABLE WOMAN BECAUSE DEVELOPERS 
WANT TO KNOCK DOWN HER HOUSE TO 
BUILD TESCO SO SHE IS TRYING TO 
DEMOLISH THE HEAD OF TESCO'S HOUSE 
INSTEAD THE GRANDMOTHER TAKING ON 
THE CONSTRUCTION GIANTS AT THEIR 
OWN GAME 
SHE WILL BE HERE IN JUST A FEW 
MINUTES MINUTES IN JUST OVER TWO WEEKS VOTERS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES WILL TAKE PART IN 
LOCAL COUNCIL ELECTIONS 
BREAKFAST WILL BE TALKING TO ALL 
THE MAIN PARTIES WE START BY 
TALKING TO THE LEADER OF THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS NICK CLEGG GOOD 
MORNING LOCAL ELECTIONS IT WILL 
BE YOUR FIRST TEST AS LEADER HOW 
MANY COUNCILS DO YOU HAVE TO WIN TO 
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE DONE WELL 
I WON'T GO INTO THE NUMBERS GAME 
IT IS FOOLISH BUT WE ARE FIGHTING 
HARD UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY L. AM 
PROUD OF THE FACT THAT THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS ARE THE ONLY OPPOSITION 
TO LABOUR AND STICKERS SEDATIVES 
WE ARE THE NATIONAL PARTY IN THESE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS CONSERVATIVES 
HOPE WE GO FROM STRENGTH TO 
STRENGTH 
DO YOU HOPE TO DO BETTER STRENGTH THAN LAST YEAR 
NO POLITICAL LEADER 
IS GOING TO SIT HERE AND SAY WE 
WANT TO GO BACK L. THINK IT WILL BE 
CLOSE A LOT OF THESE ELECTIONS 
ONLY A THIRD OF THE SEATS ARE UP 
FOR GRABS SO IT IS MORE DIFFICULT 
FOR ANY OF THE PARTIES TO MAKE 
SWEEPING PREDICTIONS BUT THE 
THINGS WE STAND FOR AT LOCAL LEVEL 
MAKING COMMUNITIES SAFER DEALING 
WITH CRIME AND ANTI SOCIAL 
BEHAVIOUR MAKING LOCAL COMMUNITIES 
GREENER LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE DONE 
IN OXFORD RICHMOND BIRMINGHAM 
EVEN ALSO VALUE FOR MONEY WE HAVE 
PRODUCED LOWER COUNCIL TAX RISES 
THAN ANY OTHER PARTY OVER THE LAST 
TEN YEARS 
YOU TALK ABOUT THE NORTH 
SOUTH DIVIDE ARE YOU GIVING TWO 
DIFFERENT MESSAGES TO DIFFERENT 
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY OR IS IT A 
NATIONAL MESSAGE 
I AM FROM 
SHEFFIELD I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE 
DIFFERENT HUMAN BEINGS EVERYBODY 
WANTS TO LIVE IN A SIEVE FOR 
COMMUNITY AND A MORE 
ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE 
COMMUNITY EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE 
THE MONEY USED WELL THERE HAS BEEN 
FAR TOO MUCH WASTE PARTICULARLY 
OVER THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT WHY WHY VOTE FOR YOU RATHER THAN LABOUR OR 
THE TORIES 
WE HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE 
EFFECTIVE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT 
LOCAL DEMOCRACY WE ALWAYS BELIEVED 
TO MANY DECISIONS ARE TAKEN IN 
WHITEHALL PUSHING THE BOAT OUT TO 
CREATE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY 
SUSTAINABLE POLICIES AT LOCAL LEVEL 
USE IT MONEY WELL IN NEWCASTLE 
UNDER LIBERAL DEMOCRAT CRIME 
DROPPED BY TWELVE PER CENT IT WENT UP BY SIXTY TWO PER CENT 
UNDER LABOUR 
HE MENTIONED TAX CUTS 
ON THE AGENDA AT TWO PARTY'S SPRING 
CONFERENCE WHAT WOULD YOU CUT 
THOSE ON LOWER MIDDLE INCOMES ARE 
BEING TAXED TOO HIGH WE HAVE 
PROPOSALS TO CUT THE BASIC TWENTY P. IN 
THE POUND INCOME TAX RATE BY FOUR PER CENT TO 
SIXTEEN PER CENT AND SCRAP COUNCIL TAX 
ALTOGETHER THAT IT'S PARTICULARLY 
PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES VERY HARD 
WANT TO SEE AS LEAD THE WAY AND 
LOWERING THE TAX BURDEN FOR THOSE 
WHO NEED THE MOST HELP 
YOU HAVE 
THE MAYORAL ELECTION AND LONDON AS 
WELL YOUR CANDIDATE HAS BEEN 
OVERSHADOWED BY KEN LIVINGSTONE AND 
BORIS JOHNSTON DO YOU FEEL YOU 
HAVE THE WRONG CANDIDATE BRIAN BRIAN PADDICK IS A FIRST CLASS CANDIDATE 
UNLIKE BORIS AND KEN YES THEY 
CREATE A LOT OF NOISE AND THEY ARE 
CELEBRITIES BRIAN PADDICK HAS 
POLICE THE STREETS OF LONDON HE 
KNOWS HOW TO DELIVER A SAFE FOR 
LONDON HE SAID HE WILL PLEDGE TO 
SEE A CUT IN CRIME BY FIVE PER CENT EVERY YEAR 
AND IF HE DID NOT DELIVER THAT HE 
WOULDN'T STAND AGAIN 
PEOPLE ARE 
NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUR POLICIES 
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT 
THEY CAN NAME AND NUMBER THE AMOUNT 
OF WOMEN YOU HAVE SLEPT WITH I I EXCEPT IN POLITICS WHAT YOU SAY IS 
OFTEN INTERPRETED OVER INTERPRETED 
THESE THINGS DEVELOP A LIFE OF 
THEIR OWN 
DO YOU FEEL YOU WERE 
NAIVE IN ANSWERING THAT QUESTION 
I'M NOT GOING TO STOP SECOND 
GUESSING WISDOM OF HINDSIGHT IS 
FOOLISH IF I HAVE ANY REGRETS IT 
SERVES AS A DISTRACTION ABOUT THE 
THINGS I CARE ABOUT WHICH IS TOO 
MANY FAMILIES BEING HARD PRESSED 
WE DON'T HAVE LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
WHICH ARE AS ENVIRONMENTAL OR TOUGH 
ON ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR 
YOU REGRET 
THE FACT IT OVERSHADOWS YOUR 
POLICY 
IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE POLICY POLITICIANS ARE SCRUTINISED AND 
STORIES TAKE A LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
THEY ALL SUBSIDE AND WE MOVE ON 
STILL TO COME WE ARE TAKING A 
LOOK AT A NEW CRIME WAVE IN THE 
COUNTRYSIDE YES AS THE PRICE OF 
HEATING OIL GOES UP SO HAS THE 
NUMBER OF THEFTS THIS TANK HERE 
WAS TARGETED IT IS JUST ONE OF 
MANY MATERNITY FOR MEN OUR 
FATHERS MISSING OUT WHEN THEIR 
PARTNERS GOING TO HOSPITAL TO GIVE 
BIRTH ARE FATHER'S 
AND TORA 
ANOTHER NANCY TO BE VOTED OUT TARA 
IT IS QUITE TRANQUIL HERE IN THE 
BLUE PETER GARDEN THIS MORNING BUT 
IF IT IS DRY AND SUNNY WAY YOU ARE 
THIS MORNING THE CHANCES ARE IT 
MAY WELL NOT LAST 
ONE OR TWO OF US WILL SEE SOME 
HEAVY SLOW MOVING SHOWERS TODAY 
LET'S TRY TO PUT SOME DETAIL ON IT 
IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT WITH SHOWERY 
WEATHER SOME PERSISTENT RAIN 
DRIFTING SOUTH AT A SCOTLAND AS WE 
SPEAK SO THIS IS LITTLE BIT 
MORE ORGANISED IN TERMS OF THE 
SHOWERS SOME THUNDER AND HAIL 
MIXED IN THERE AS WELL IF THESE 
SHOWERS ARE SLOW MOVING THEY COULD 
BE REALLY QUITE NASTY FOR TIME 
HEADING INTO SCOTLAND IT LOOKS AS 
THOUGH IT IS GOING TO BE A PLEASANT 
ENOUGH AFTERNOON THE RAIN WILL 
HAVE EASED THE CLOUD SHOULD BE 
BREAKING UP AND WE SHOULD SEE SOME 
SUNNY SPELLS COMING THROUGH FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND YOU SHOULD HAVE A 
CRACKING AFTERNOON WITH PLENTY OF 
SUNSHINE BACK ACROSS THE IRISH SEA 
INTO WALES FEWER SHOWERS FOR THE 
SOUTH WEST GENERALLY THIS AFTERNOON 
THERE WILL BE ONE OR TWO DOTTED 
AROUND WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING CENTRAL AND 
EASTERN AREAS SEEN FREQUENT SHOWERS 
THIS AFTERNOON THIS WILL AFFECT 
THE FEEL OF THINGS BUT AWAY FROM 
THE RAIN IT WILL BE PLEASANT 
ENOUGH EIGHT TO TEN DEGREES STILL 
RELATIVELY MILD OVERNIGHT TONIGHT 
THE SHOWERS WELLIES A FROST COULD 
DEVELOP OVERNIGHT THE SHOWERS 
WILL EASE MORE RAIN TO COME FOR 
SCOTLAND 
THE EXTREME SOUTH OF ENGLAND AND 
THE FAR NORTH SHOULD STAY DRY AND 
SUNNY MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES OF TWELVE 
DEGREES FOR TOMORROW 
THERE IS A NEW CRIME WAVE IN THE 
COUNTRYSIDE THIEVES STEALING OIL 
USED TO FIRE HEATING SYSTEMS WHICH 
IS CONTAINED IN STORAGE TANKS THE 
CROOKS ARE MAKING OFF WITH 
THOUSANDS OF POUNDS WORTH OF FUEL 
WITH THE RISING PRICE OF OIL THIS 
CRIME IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY 
ATTRACTIVE ATTRACTIVE THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT I DO 
NOT KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE HERE THIS 
IS HEATING OR OIL IT IS ABOUT 
THREE QUARTERS FULL BUT RECENTLY 
THIEVES AND TEED THIS TANK ONE OF 
MANY TO BE TARGETED IN THIS PART OF 
THE WORLD RECENTLY THIEVES AND 
TEED THIS TANK THIS IS THE VILLAGE 
OF BARDWELL NEAR BURY SAINT ALBANS 
POLICE SAY THE CRIME HAS GONE UP 
BECAUSE THE PRICE OF OIL HAS GONE 
UP BURY SAINT EDMUNDS LIKE LAURA 
MITCHELL WHO LIVES HERE THE 
VICTIMS DO NOT EVEN KNOW THEY HAVE 
BEEN TARGETED WHEN LAURA 
MITCHELL'S KEATING STOPPED SHE 
ASSUMED HER HEATING SYSTEM WAS ON 
THE BLINK BUT IT WAS FINE THE 
PROBLEM WAS OUT HERE AN EMPTY 
PROBLEM WAS OUT HERE AN EMPTY TANK WHEN LAURA MITCHELL'S 
HEATING STOPPED 
IT NEVER OCCURRED 
TO US THAT SOMEBODY WOULD STEAL OUR 
OIL IT WAS A SHOCK IT MEANT WE 
HAD NO HOT WATER OR HEATING UNTIL 
WE HAVE SOME MORE OIL DELIVERED 
AND IT IS JUST VERY INCONVENIENT 
AND A LITTLE BIT CREEPY THAT 
SOMEBODY HAD COME DOWN HERE AND 
STOLEN IT 
DOWN THE ROAD THE VILLAGE PUB HAS 
BEEN TARGETED TOO NOW PEOPLE 
HERE ARE GETTING JUMPY 
IT IS QUITE A CONCERN WE HAVE HAD 
PEOPLE COMING IN TRYING TO BUY 
EXTRA LOCKS TO SECURE THEIR GATES 
AND SO FORTH 
INDIA BY NORFOLK ALMOST HOME A 
DAY WAS HIT LAST MONTH AMONG THEM 
THIS MAN'S 
THEY ARE NOW BOTH 
LOCKED IT IS NOT GREAT SECURITY 
BUT AT LEAST IT IS A DETERRENT 
THIEVES HAVE STRUCK HERE MORE THAN 
ONCE COSTING HIM MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND 
PERHAPS WE WOULD LOOK AT IT EVERY 
COUPLE OF WEEKS WE THOUGHT WE HAD 
BETTER HAVE A LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF 
THE OIL AND WE WERE FINDING THAT 
HALF A TENT HAD GONE TWELVE HUNDRED LITRES 
HAD GONE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS WE 
REALISED THAT SOMETHING MIGHT NOT 
BE QUITE RIGHT HALF A TANK BOTH BOTH OF THESE INSTANCES ARE IN QUIET 
LOCATIONS AND THIS IS JUST WHAT 
THE POLICE SAY THE THIEVES ARE 
LOOKING FOR 
THERE IS SOME 
COMPLEXITY IN THESE THIEVES WE 
HAVE FOUND VEHICLES WITH PUMPING 
APPARATUS AND SO ON THESE CAN WORK 
UNOBSERVED TO STEAL THE OIL THE THE ADVICE IS TO KEEP AN EYE OUT AND 
LOCK UP IT IS BECOMING AN 
EXPENSIVE COMMODITY LOCK UP 
IT IS NOT JUST LOCKS POLICE SAY 
YOU SHOULD PUT SECURITY LIGHTS 
AROUND YOUR TENT AND IF POSSIBLE 
IT IS NOT EASY BUT TRY TO MOVE 
YOUR TANK TO SOMEWHERE WHERE IT CAN 
BE SEEN FOR THE WHOLE OF SUFFOLK 
LAST YEAR THERE WERE NINE CASES 
SO FAR THIS YEAR THERE HAS ALREADY 
BEEN NINETEEN THE STORY IS SIMILAR IN 
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY NOW I 
RECENTLY SPOKE TO AN OIL SUPPLIER 
AND THEY SAY THEY ARE GETTING ABOUT 
TWO CALLS A WEEK FROM PEOPLE SAYING 
WE HAVE HAD OUR OR OIL STOLEN WE 
NEED MORE OR OIL BUT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE NOT REPORTING IT BECAUSE 
THEY DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THEIR NO 
CLAIMS BONUS 
NOW A GRANDMOTHER FROM MERSEYSIDE 
HAS APPLIED FOR PLANNING PATIENT TO 
DEMOLISH THE HOME OF TESCO BOSS SIR 
TERRY LEAHY FOR PLANNING 
PERMISSION 
GOOD MORNING THIS IS RETALIATION 
ON A GRAND SCALE 
I DID NOT KNOW 
WHAT ELSE TO DO 
CALLAS ALL YOUR 
HOUSE HAS NOT BEEN THERE THAT LONG 
HAS IT 
FIFTEEN YEARS 
WHAT OTHER PLANS 
FOR IT 
TO FLATTEN IT TO TURN IT 
INTO A CAR PARK FOR SHOPPERS AND 
FOOTBALL FANS 
WHERE DID YOU GET 
THE IDEA FROM TO GET YOUR OWN BACK 
ON SIR TERRY LEAHY 
THIS HAS BEEN 
HANGING OVER US NOW FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
IT IS PUTTING AN AWFUL LOT OF 
STRESS ON EVERYONE IT SEEMS TO BE 
THE MAIN TALKING POINT ALL OVER 
KOBE ESPECIALLY BETWEEN THE SEVENTY TWO 
PROPERTIES WE JUST THOUGHT WHAT 
ELSE CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS ALL 
OVER KIRKBY SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD 
DO SOMETHING TO WAKE THEM UP SO SO YOU HAVE APPLIED FOR PLANNING 
PERMISSION FOR HIS HOUSE EVEN 
THOUGH YOU DO NOT OWN THE LAND 
WHAT WERE YOU PLANNING TO DO WITH 
IT 
COMMUNITY GARDENS JUST FLATTEN IT IT DOWN WE HAVE GOT THE ARCHITECTS 
WORKING ON IT NOW 
TESCO SAY THIS 
MOVE IS CLEARLY A PUBLICITY STUNT 
IT WILL JUST WASTE TIME EFFORT AND 
TAXPAYERS' MONEY 
WELL THAT IS FOR 
ME TO KNOW AND FOR THEM TO FIND OUT 
BECAUSE THE ARCHITECTS ARE WORKING 
ON IT NOW IT HAS TO GO THROUGH ALL 
OF THE CHANNELS THE POINT IS HOW 
FAR WILL IT GO 
I KNOW IT IS YOUR 
HOUSE AND EVERYTHING THEY WOULD 
COMPENSATE YOU THOUGH I I SUPPOSE THEY HAVE GOT TO COMPENSATE 
US BUT THE POINT IS THAT THIS IS A 
HOUSING CORPORATION THAT WE HAVE 
FORMED FOR FIVE YEARS TO GET 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING TO BUILD IT IT 
IS REGENERATED AND WHAT WE CAN'T 
COME ACROSS WAS THEY WANT TO 
REGENERATE IT BUT REGENERATED INTO 
A CAR PARK 
TESCO IS SAYING IT IS A 
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION INVESTMENT WIDE 
CONSULTATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE THE 
PLANS HAVE BEEN WELCOMED BY THE 
VAST MAJORITY OF LOCAL PEOPLE WHO 
RECOGNISED HIS ONCE IN A LIFETIME 
OPPORTUNITY WHICH WILL CREATE MORE 
THAN TWO THOUSAND JOBS 
WELL TWO THOUSAND JOBS 
PART TIME STACKING SHELVES IN 
TESCO'S 
THEY SAY MOST PEOPLE TESCO'S IN THE AREA WELCOME IT 
NO THE 
ONLY WAY THEY WILL FIND THAT THE 
TRUE FEELINGS OF THE RESIDENTS WILL 
BE FOR THEM TO GO KNOCKING ON 
EVERYONE'S DOOR NOT JUST HOLDING A 
CONSULTATION WHERE YOU DO NOT GET 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE COMING 
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF RESIDENTIAL 
GROUPS FORMING NOW THERE IS AN

IMPROVEMENTS WHICH ARE RELATIVELY 
INEXPENSIVE THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT 
THE BUSES IT IS GREAT THAT WE HAVE 
GOT MORE BUSES BUT IN SOME AREAS

CONGESTION AND THEY COULD LOOK AT

GIVES BIRTH IS A THING OF THE PAST 
THEY WANT FATHERS TO STAY IN 
HOSPITAL OVERNIGHT TO BOND WITH 
THEIR NEWBORN BABIES 
RICHARD BEAN THE FATHER OF MAISIE 
WHO IS 
SHE IS JUST OVER TWO HOW HOW DID YOU FEEL YOU WERE TREATED THE THE STAFF WERE WONDERFUL ALL 
THROUGHOUT THE BIRTH THEY WERE 
CARING KIND AND COMPASSIONATE 
TOWARDS MY WIFE INCLUDING ME 
WHERE THEY COULD BUT IF YOU DO 
KNOW AS A FATHER YOU WILL BE A BIT 
OF A SPARE PART DURING THE DELIVERY 
WITH A LONG INDUCED LABOUR GOING 
ON TO A C. SECTION EVERYTHING WENT 
WELL AFTER THE FOLLOWING EVENING 
I SPENT THE DAY WITH MAISIE AND 
SALLY I WAS KICKED OUT AT TEN P. M. AS 
WERE ALL THE OTHER VISITORS L. L. WAS 
LEFT SAT IN THE CAR ONE IN WHAT 
WAS GOING ON 
IS IT APPROPRIATE TO 
HAVE EXTRA PEOPLE AROUND 
I AM NOT 
EXTRA PEOPLE MY WIFE WANTED ME TO 
BE THERE SHE HAD GONE THROUGH A 
TRAUMATIC LABOUR JUST AT THE TIME 
WHEN WE WERE FEELING VULNERABLE AND 
SHE WANTED SUPPORT FROM ME I 
COULDN'T GIVE IT TO HER SHOULD SHOULD HOSPITALS MAKE PROVISIONS FOR THE 
FATHER'S TO STAY AROUND TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
THERE HAS BEEN CLASSES INCLUDING 
DADS FOR DECADES NOW DAD'S BEING 
AROUND AFTER THE BIRTH JUST LIKE 
ANTENATAL CLASSES IT IS UP TO THE 
MOTHER AND FATHER TO DECIDE 
HOSPITALS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY OR 
FACILITIES TO GIVE MOTHERS ONE TO 
ONE CARE IN NEIGHBOUR SO WE WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE THAT IN PLACE BUT 
THAT'S DO NEED TO BE AROUND WITH 
THE MUMS USUALLY THE COUPLE WOULD 
CHOOSE TO HAVE A HOME BIRTH IF WE 
ARE TO CHANGE THAT FOR HOSPITALS 
WE NEED RADICAL CHANGES YOU HAVE 
TO CHANGE THE WAY THE MATERNITY 
HOSPITALS WORK A LOT OF POST NATAL 
WARDS ARE ROOMS WERE MANY WOMEN ARE 
STAYING AND YOU CANNOT HAVE MEN 
THERE WITH LOT OF OTHER WOMEN IF 
WE CHANGE THE WAY MATERNITY 
HOSPITALS WORK WITH SINGLE ROOMS 
IT WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR DAD'S 
TO STAY OVERNIGHT 
WE ALL KNOW 
THEIR N. H. S. IS REALLY OVERSTRETCHED 
WHAT OTHER CHANGES COULD BE MADE 
RICHARD THAT WOULD MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE IN THOSE FIRST IMPORTANT 
HOURS 
I UNDERSTAND IT'S DIFFICULT HOURS BECAUSE SPACE IS AN ISSUE BUT JUST 
TO GIVE THAT EXTRA BIT OF TIME L. L. 
HAVE FRIENDS THAT WHOSE WIVES GAVE 
BIRTH AT TWO THIRTY AM AND THEY WERE 
KICKED OUT AT THREE THIRTY AM 
YOU ARE A 
MANAGER IN A HOSPITAL ON TO 
I AM 
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES I I DO WE ARE TRYING TO WORK AROUND 
IT IS NOT AN EASY ISSUE IF IT WAS 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLVED A LONG 
TIME AGO IF THE MOTHER WANTS THE 
FATHER OF THE CHILD OR A 
SIGNIFICANT MEMBER INNER LIFE AND 
FAMILY TO BE THERE WE SHOULD GIVE 
THEM THE OPPORTUNITY 
WHAT ABOUT 
SMALL CHANGES YOU ARE TALKING 
ABOUT A SINGLE ROOM IT IS NOT 
GOING TO HAPPEN 
WE NEED ONE TO ONE 
CARE FOR ALL WOMEN IN LABOUR WE 
DON'T HAVE THAT YET WHEN WOMEN 
GIVE BIRTH THEY LIKE TO BE IN A 
ROOM THAT IS SUITABLY SET UP A LOT 
OF BIRTH CENTRES ARE HAVING SINGLE 
ROOMS AND DADS CAN STAY OVERNIGHT 
WE NEED MORE BIRTH CENTRE HAS BEEN 
SET UP THOSE ARE THE IDEAL PLACES 
FOR NORMAL NEIGHBOURS AND THEY 
OFTEN HAVE ROOM FOR THE DADS TO 
STAY 
WE WILL BE TALKING TO YOU STAY AGAIN IN THE NEXT HOUR IF YOU HAVE 
A VIEW ON IT SHARE IT WITH US 
THE MAIN STORIES THIS MORNING 
INVESTIGATORS IN ECUADOR ARE TRYING 
TO ESTABLISH WHAT CAUSED THE CRASH 
IN WHICH FIVE YOUNG BRITISH WOMEN 
WERE KILLED 
A POSTMORTEM IS TO BE CARRIED OUT 
ON WHAT IS THOUGHT TO BE THE 
MISSING TELEVISION PRESENTER MARK 
SPEIGHT FOUND AT PADDINGTON 
RAILWAY STATION 
ALSO NOT TO BE SNEEZED AT MELINDA 
MESSENGER IS HERE ON HOW TO SPOT 
THE SYMPTOMS OF HAY FEVER 
IT IS GOING TO BE WORSE THIS YEAR 
BECAUSE TWO POLLEN SEASONS ARE 
OVERLAPPING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
IS THAT RIGHT YES 
WE WERE HAVING A LOOK AT THE 
INTERNET EARLIER ON AND BIRCH 
POLLEN IS EXPECTED TO BE AT MEDIUM 
LEVELS TODAY ONE OF THE REASONS 
FOR THIS IS THAT WE ARE EXPECTED TO 
GET SOME SUNSHINE SUNSHINE AND 
SHOWERS THAT WILL BE THE SCENARIO 
GENERALLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY TODAY 
IT IS A CHILLY START BUT A FRESH 
AND BRIGHT ONE IT WILL BE ANOTHER 
CLASSIC DAY OF APRIL SHOWERS I 
THINK WE HAVE GOT SOME RAIN AT THE 
MOMENT THROUGH SOUTHERN SCOTLAND 
THAT WILL BE EDGING FURTHER NORTH 
EAST IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS AFTER 
THAT SCOTLAND SHOULD HAVE A 
RELATIVELY QUIET DAY TODAY 
THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON THE 
HEAVIEST MOST FREQUENT AND SLOW 
MOVING SHOWERS ARE LIKELY TO BE IN 
EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST AND 
CORNER IT COULD BE A FAIRLY 
MISERABLE AFTERNOON HERE POSSIBLY 
SOME HAIL AND THUNDER AS WELL 
THERE WILL BE SOME SHOWERS IN 
LINCOLNSHIRE UP INTO YORKSHIRE 
BUT GETTING TOWARDS THE SCOTTISH 
BORDERS IT WILL BE LARGELY DRY 
IT'LL BE A PLEASANT DRY AFTERNOON 
FOR MUCH OF SCOTLAND AND IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND IT'LL BE A 
GLORIOUS AFTERNOON INTO WALES WE 
WILL SEE FREQUENT SHOWERS PERHAPS 
INLAND IN THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND IT SHOULD BE LARGELY DRY 
AND BRIGHT 
IN TERMS OF TEMPERATURES AND THE 
FEEL OF THINGS ONCE THE SHOWERS 
KICKING TEMPERATURES WILL DROP 
BUT IN BETWEEN IN THE SUNNY 
MOMENTS WE'RE LOOKING AT BETWEEN EIGHT 
TO TEN IN THE NORTH AND A LITTLE 
BIT WARMER FURTHER SOUTH 
IN WILL WILL SPOTS IT COULD BE 
DOWN TO EXCEED TWO OR THREE TONIGHT 
IN RURAL SPOTS IT COULD BE DOWN 
TO TWO OR THREE 
AT LAST THAT IS ALL I CAN SAY 
LET'S TALK TO DECLAN NOW HE IS 
TALKING ABOUT REPOSSESSIONS BEING 
ON THE INCREASE 
GOOD MORNING WE'RE HERE AT A 
SPECIALIST ADVICE CENTRE FOR 
HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE HAVING 
DIFFICULTIES WITH THEIR MORTGAGES 
IT IS THE CONSUMER CREDIT 
COUNSELLING SERVICE THE BIGGEST 
DEBT ADVICE CHARITY IN BRITAIN 
THEY HAVE GOT THIS SPECIAL CENTRE 
TO GIVE ADVICE TO HOMEOWNERS 
BECAUSE OF THE RISING NUMBER OF 
REPOSSESSIONS LET ME GIVE YOU THE 
HELPLINE NUMBER RIGHT AWAY DON'T 
WORRY I WILL BE GIVING THIS NUMBER 
AGAIN AT THE END OF THIS REPORT HERE IS THE NUMBER 
NOW TWENTY SOUND ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE LOST 
THEIR HOMES LAST YEAR THAT NUMBER 
IS EXPECTED TO RISE THIS YEAR 
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES 
EVERY ONE OF THOSE CASES IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH MISERY AND STRESS 
WE WERE SPEAKING TO ONE MAN WHO 
MISSED MORTGAGE PAYMENTS BECAUSE HE 
HAD TO TAME BECAUSE HE HAD TO 
TAKE TIME OFF WORK BECAUSE OF ILL 
HEALTH 
THEY HAD APPLIED TO THE HEALTH COURTS AND FOR SIX MONTHS I HAD 
BEEN RECEIVING MAIL AT FIRST I 
WAS TRYING TO DEAL WITH EVERY PIECE 
OF MAIL UNTIL SUCH TIME WHEN I 
JUST WAS EXHAUSTED I COULDN'T COPE 
WITH THEM L. L. WAS INUNDATED WITH IT 
I LEFT MANY OF THEM UNOPENED AND 
THE CASE FOR MY HOUSE REPOSSESSION 
HAD GONE THROUGH THE COURTS BY 
DEFAULT WITHOUT ME EVEN DEFENDING 
IT SO AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS 
BY DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX COURT BAILIFF 
FROM THE GLOUCESTER TOWN COURT 
KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND SAID 
YOUR HOUSE IS NOW UNDER AN 
EVICTION ORDER JOINING ME NOW 
AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CENTRE 
HERE HERE YES WE HAVE BEEN TAKING CALLS ALL 
MORNING SINCE WE SWITCHED THE 
LIONS ON AT SIX O'CLOCK WHEN YOU 
FIRST DENOUNCED THE NUMBER WE HAVE 
BEEN SPEAKING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
GOT REPOSSESSION HEARINGS TODAY 
AND LATER ON IN THE WEEK PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO GO TO COURT TODAY WHO 
COULD BE TOLD THAT THEY COULD LOSE 
THEIR HOMES TODAY AND THEY ARE 
RINGING IN THIS MORNING 
YES AND 
WE HAVE GIVEN THEM EMERGENCY A PAUL 
MUNS SO THAT WE CAN GIVE THEM SOME 
ADVICE SO THAT THEY CAN AT LEAST GO 
TO COURT PREPARED WE HAVE BEEN 
GIVING THEM EMERGENCY APPOINTMENTS 
IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO CALL AND 
GET ADVICE 
THE ADVICE IS THAT DO 
NOT IGNORE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE 
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE 
FOR MOST PEOPLE THERE IS SOMETHING 
THAT CAN BE DONE FOR SOME PEOPLE 
TRAGICALLY THEY WILL LOSE THEIR 
HOMES BUT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE 
ESPECIALLY IF THEY CALL EARLY 
ENOUGH THERE IS PLENTY OF ADVICE 
AND THERE IS PLENTY OF OPTIONS FOR 
THEM 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST LET THEM ME GIVE YOU THAT NUMBER AGAIN 
MORE FROM HERE AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SORRY ABOUT 
THE BREAK UP ON THAT PICTURE MANY 
CYCLISTS WHO RIDE IN TOWNS OR 
CITIES COMPLAIN THAT THEY ARE 
TREATED BY MOTORISTS AS IF THEY ARE 
INVISIBLE THIS IS THE PROBLEM 
WHICH PROMPTED AN INVENTOR TO 
DESIGN A CYCLING JACKET WHICH USES 
COLOURED LIGHTS TO INDICATE WHETHER 
THE RIDER IS GOING FASTER SLOWING 
DOWN OR TURNING IT HAS NOW WON A 
TOP INTERNATIONAL DESIGN AWARD 
GOOD MORNING LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW 
IT WORKS AND WHAT IT DOES CAN YOU 
STAND UP AND SHOW US 
THE BACK 
THIS GREEN COLOUR SHOWS THAT WHEN 
YOU ARE RIDING FORWARD IT WILL BE 
GOING WHEN YOU HIT THE BRAKE IF

GOING RED 
SO THAT CARS BEHIND YOU 
KNOW YOU'RE SLOWING DOWN EXACTLY EXACTLY AND THEN WHEN I TERM WHEN I RAISE 
MY ARM BUT WHEN I TURN CAN CAN YOU SEE IT THERE TURNAROUND AND 
SIT DOWN AND DO IT AGAIN SO SO ACTUALLY IF THE CAR IS WATCHING 
YOU YOU HAVE WORN THIS JACKET ON 
THE STREETS HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE 
DOES IT MAKE AS A CYCLIST VISUALLY VISUALLY THEY GET TO SEE YOU FROM MUCH 
FURTHER AWAY AND A NOTICE YOU MORE 
THAT IN ITSELF HELPS THE CYCLIST A 
LOT MORE THAN JUST WEARING A 
TRADITIONAL HIGH VISIBILITY JACKET 
YOU MENTIONED THE FACT THAT THEY 
MAKE MORE EYE CONTACT WITH YOU TOO 
EXACTLY THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
THEY MOVE AROUND YOU MORE THAT IN 
ITSELF IS VERY VALUABLE BECAUSE 
IT'S A LARGER VISUAL PROPERTY ON 
THE ROAD 
WE KNOW THAT LOTS OF 
CYCLISTS ARE KILLED ON THE ROADS 
SO DO YOU THINK THAT THIS WOULD 
SAVE LIVES 
I DO THINK SO I HOPE 
SO IF IT EVER GETS TO MARKET I 
WOULD HOPE SO 
LOTS OF CYCLISTS AND 
PARENTS THIS MORNING SAYING HOW 
CAN I GET MY HANDS ON ONE THERE 
IS THE DIFFICULTY 
AND AT THE 
MOMENT I AM TRYING TO GET SOME 
INVESTORS AND MANUFACTURERS TO GO

PEOPLE FROM REPORTING THEIR

COMPLAINT MAY RESULT IN A JAIL 
SENTENCE IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE THIRTEEN 
MILLION PEOPLE WHO IS SUFFERING 
FROM HAYFEVER THERE'S GOOD CHANCE

FOR YOUR ALLERGY 
THE ROYAL SOCIETY PHARMACEUTICAL 
SOCIETY SAID FIVE MILLION COULD 
EASE THEIR POSITION IF THEY 
FOLLOWED THE RIGHT MEDICAL ADVICE 
SPRING IS HERE AND FOR MILLIONS OF 
HAYFEVER SUFFERERS THE MISERY IS 
JUST BEGINNING HAYFEVER IS CAUSED 
MAINLY BY POLLEN WHEN IT'S 
BREATHED IN THERE CAN BE AN 
ALLERGIC REACTION IRRITATING THE 
EYES AND NOSE BUT MANY PEOPLE 
DON'T REALISE THEY HAVE HAYFEVER 
IN SURVEY TODAY FOUR PER CENT OF PEOPLE SAID 
THEY'D MISDIAGNOSED THE CONDITION 
THINKING IT WAS COLD SEVENTY THREE PER CENT SAID 
THEY HADN'T GOT ANY ADVICE BEFORE 
GETTING MEDICAL TREATMENT IT MEANS 
MANY END UP BUYING COLD REMEDIES 
WHICH DON'T WORK FOR HAYFEVER 
A LARGE PROPORTION FIVE MILLION OR 
SO PEOPLE PUT THEIR HEALTH AT RISK 
BY MISDIAGNOSING AND SELECTING 
INAPPROPRIATE MEDICATION FOR THEIR 
CONDITION 
THERE ARE A RANGE OF CONDITION PRODUCTS WHICH CAN HELP THE EFFECTS 
OF HAYFEVER THE MESSAGE FROM 
PHARMACISTS TAKE ADVICE DON'T 
SUFFER IN SILENCE 
WE'VE GOT AN UPDATE ON THE SIX 
MAASAI 
WHO CAME TO RUN IN 
THE MARATHON FOR THEIR VILLAGE 
THEY WERE ON BREAKFAST LAST WEEK 
UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THEM HAD TO 
DROP OUT BECAUSE HE WAS ILL AND 
TAKEN TO HOSPITAL FOR CHECKS BY ONE 
OF HIS FRIENDS THE OTHER FOUR DID 
MAKE IT TO THE FINISH IN JUST UNDER 
FIVE AND A HALF HOURS 
WE HAD 
TROUBLE WITH THE COLD AND PAIN BUT 
WHEN WE ARE RUNNING WE FEEL GOOD 
CONGRATULATIONS TO THEM 
BOUND TO FEEL COLD IN YESTERDAY 
THEY DID BRILLIANTLY 
IT WAS A GAP YEAR ADVENTURE TO 
ECUADOR WHICH HAS ENDED IN TRAGEDY 
FOUR TEENAGE GIRLS AND THEIR TOUR 
LEADER WERE KILLED IN THE COLLISION 
ON SATURDAY EVENING ON THEIR WAY TO 
VOLUNTEER IN A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT 
MARK DAVISON IS FROM VENTURECO THE 
COMPANY WHICH ORGANISED THE TRIP 
HE JOINS US NOW THIS IS OBVIOUSLY 
A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR YOU AND 
FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE GIRLS 
INVOLVED HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED FRUSTRATINGLY FRUSTRATINGLY NOT AS MUCH YOUR REPORTER SEEMS TO 
KNOW WE'VE BEEN TOLD WE 
SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE AIRLIFT 
YESTERDAY UP TO THE CAPITAL QUITO 
AND THE AMBULANCES TOOK THE FOUR 
REQUIRING HOSPITAL TREATMENT TO 
HOSPITAL HOSPITAL AND THEY'VE ALL MADE CONTACT WITH 
HOME 
HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HOME THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ACCIDENT 
IT INVOLVED A LORRY CARRYING SOME 
SAND 
I'VE HEARD INAUDIBLE AT THE SAND MOMENT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING HUMAN 
PART OF THIS TRAGEDY OUR NEXT 
PHASE IS TO START LOOKING INTO WHAT 
HAPPENED AND WHERE AND WHY IT'S IT'S VERY SAD PARTICULARLY THAT THEY 
SEEM TO HAVE OVERCOME THE MORE 
HAZARDOUS PART OF THE JOURNEY AND 
WERE RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THEIR 
DESTINATION 
QUITE SO QUITE SO DESTINATION OUR RISK ASSESSMENT IDENTIFIED THE 
HIGH ANDES AS THE POTENTIAL RISKY 
PART OF THAT TRIP THEY COMPLETED 
THAT AND IT WAS BEHIND THEM THEY 
WERE REALLY ON THE HOME STRETCH 
WHICH IS A SAFER PART OF THAT 
JOURNEY 
YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING THESE JOURNEY VENTURES FOR SOME YEARS THIS IS 
THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING HAS GONE 
WRONG 
IT IS WRONG WE STARTED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE THIS IS THE 
FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD AN INCIDENT 
SUCH AS THIS 
ARE YOU REVIEWING YOUR SAFETY 
PROCEDURES NOW L. L. DON'T KNOW IF 
THERE'S ANY WAY YOU CAN REDUCE THE 
RISK OF TRAVELLING BY ROAD IN 
ECUADOR 
TRAVELLING BY ROAD ECUADOR THROUGHOUT SOUTH AMERICA HAS AN 
INHERENT RISK THAT'S QUITE SO BUT 
WE WILL OF COURSE REVISIT ALL OUR 
PROCEDURES AFTER CONCLUSIONS HAVE 
BEEN DRAWN AND THE INVESTIGATION IS 
COMPLETED 
OF COURSE PARENTS OF COMPLETED TEENAGERS ON SIMILAR TRIPS AROUND 
THE WORLD PARTICULARLY IN SOUTH 
AMERICA AND GOING WITH YOUR COMPANY 
WILL BE WONDERING CAN MY CHILD 
REALLY BE SAFE 
THERE'S A BALANCE 
BETWEEN RISK AND SAFETY L. THINK 
ADVENTURE TRAVEL HAS AN INHERENT 
RISK TO IT BUT AS A TOUR OPERATOR 
WE HAVE TO EXAMINE ALL THE 
POTENTIAL RISKS AND OPERATE AS 
SAFELY AS WE CAN 
THANK YOU 
OUR APOLOGIES FOR THE SOUND 
PROBLEMS IN THAT INTERVIEW 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME TODAY 
HAYFEVER SEASON IS UPON US WE'LL 
LOOK AT THE BEST TIPS FOR AVOIDING 
THE MISERY OF A RUNY NOSE AND WEEPY 
EYES WITH THE HELP OF ME LINDA 
MESSENGER MESSENGER HELEN MCCRORY WILL BE HERE TO TELL 
US ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO STAR 
ALONGSIDE DANIEL CRAIG IN HER NEW 
FILM FLASHBACKS OF A FOOL 
IS IT GOING TO BE CHILLY TODAY 
LOUISE CAN TELL US 
ONLY FIRST THING AND THEN IT SHOULD 
BE QUITE A MILD DAY THERE IS NOT A 
CLOUD IN THE SKY HERE IN LONDON 
BUT DON'T BE FOOLED IF YOU ARE 
SETTING OUTSIDE AND IT'S GLORIOUS 
CLEAR SKIES AND SUNSHINE AROUND THE 
STORY IS FOR FREQUENT SHOWERS 
AROUND AGAIN THAT TYPICAL STORY OF 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS I THINK WILL 
BE WITH US PRETTY MUCH ALL WEEK 
BUT THERE WILL BE ONE OR TWO SPOTS 
THAT WILL STAY LARGELY DRY A 
FAVOURED FEW ARE NORTHERN IRELAND 
AND SCOTLAND DESPITE CLOUD IN 
SCOTLAND AT THE MOMENT AND RAIN 
CLEARING OUT OF SCOTLAND TOWARDS 
THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND IT WILL 
BE A PROMISING AFTERNOON TO COME 
ELSEWHERE FREQUENT SHOWERS THROUGH 
NORTHERN AND EASTERN AREAS IT 
PARTICULARLY INTO THE THE AFTERNOON 
THE HEAVIEST WIDESPREAD SLOW 
MOVING ONES ARE LIKELY TO BE IN THE 
EAST CORNER WITH HAIL AND THUNDER 
MIXED IN FOR GOOD MEASURE 
FREQUENT SHOWERS ACROSS THE NORTH 
OF ENGLAND AND STRETCHING TOWARDS 
THE SCOTTISH BORDERS ONCE YOU GET 
INTO SCOTLAND THAT CLOUD SHOULD 
BREAK UP WITH SUNNY SPELLS FROM 
TIME TO TIME AND IT SHOULD BE 
PLEASANT WITH LIGHT WINDS FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND AGAIN A DAY OF 
CLEAR SKIES AND SUNSHINE I THINK 
IT WILL BE A VERY NICE AFTERNOON 
CERTAINLY BETTER THAN IT HAS BEEN 
FOR THE LAST COUPLE 
A SIMILAR STORY FOR THE ISLE OF MAN 
BUT INTO WALES TECHLY FURTHER 
INLAND FOR WALES YOU'RE LIKELY TO 
SEE ONE OR TWO SHOWERS 
IT'S A SHOWERY SCENARIO IN THE 
SHOWERS IT WILL FEEL FRESH BUT IN 
THE SUNSHINE IN THE SHELTER THOSE 
TEMPERATURES ARE PROMISING EIGHT TO 
TWELVE DEGREES AT THE BEST OVERNIGHT 
THE SHOWERS WILL RECEDE THE SKIES 
WILL CONTINUE TO CLEAR SO IT WILL 
BE A COLD AND POTENTIALLY FROSTY 
NIGHT SO WORTH BEARING IN MIND FOR 
GARDENERS AS TEMPERATURES FALL 
DOWN TO MINUS TWO OR MINUS THREE IN 
SOME SPOTS IN THE CITIES WE'RE 
LOOKING AT ONE TO THREE DEGREES FPL 
I THINK IF YOU DRAW A LINE FROM THE 
M. FOUR CORRIDOR OVER TOWARDS THE THAMES 
ESTUARY SOUTH OF THAT SHOULD BE 
DRIER SUNNIER DAY TOMORROW 
ELSEWHERE SHOWERS AROUND THE 
MIDLANDS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND BUT 
TO SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
AGAIN 
BE LARGELY DRY WITH 
HIGHS OF NINE TO TWELVE DEGREES 
THERE IS A NEW CRIME WAVE TAKING 
PLACE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE THIEVES 
ARE STEALING OIL USED TO FUEL 
HEATING SYSTEMS THEY ARE MAKING 
OFF WITH THOUSANDS OF POUNDS WORTH 
OF FUEL AND THE RISING COST OF OIL 
IS MAKING THE CRIME INCREASINGLY 
ATTRACTSIVE MIKE CARTWRIGHT 
REPORTS THIS IS WHAT IT IS ABOUT 
OIL WE HAVE TAKEN IT FROM THIS 
TANK BUT RECENTLY THIEVES EMPTIED 
THE TANK ONE OF MANY IN THIS PART 
OF THE WORLD TO BE TARGETED FPLGT 
WE HAVE COME TO SUFFOLK T. REASON 
THE POLICE SAY FOR THE CRIME WAVE 
IS THE RISE IN OIL THIS TANK HOLDS 
A THOUSAND LITRES THIS TIME LAST 
YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE COST TWO HUNDRED NOW 
IT WOULD COST OVER FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE 
LIKE LAUREN WHO LIVES HERE THEY 
DON'T KNOW THEY HAVE BEEN TARGETED 
BY THIEVES WHEN HER HEATING 
STOPPED SHE ASSUMED HER BOILER WAS 
ON THE BLINK BUT HER SYSTEM WAS 
FINE T. PROBLEM WAS OUT HERE AN 
EMPTY TANK TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WORTH OF OIL HAD 
BEEN STOLEN 
I NEVER OCCURRED TO US 
THAT SOMEBODY WOULD STEAL OUR OIL 
IT WAS A SHOCK IT MEANT WE HAD NO 
HOT WATER OR HEATING UNTIL WE HAD 
SOME MORE OIL DELIVERED IT JUST 
YOU KNOW IT IS INCONVENIENT AND A 
BIT SCREEP E. CREEPY THAT SOMEBODY 
HAD STOLEN IT 
THE VILLAGE PUB HAS 
BEEN TARGETED AND PEOPLE ARE JERT 
GETTING JUMPY 
WE HAD PEOPLE TRYING 
TO BUY EXTRA LOCKS TO SECURE THEIR 
GATES THEY ARE WORRIED THAT PEOPLE 
WILL COME IN 
IN NORFOLK ALMOST A 
HOME A DAY WAS HIT LAST MONTH 
AMONG THEM HUGH'S 
THEY ARE BOTH 
LOCKED WITH CAPS IT IS NOT GREAT 
SECURITY 
THIEVES HAVE STRUCK HERE SECURITY MORE THAN ONCE IT HAS COST HUGH 
MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND 
PERHAPS WE WOULD 
LOOK AT IT EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS 
THEN WE FOUND HALF A TANK HAD GONE 
IT CLICKED THAT THERE MIGHT BE 
SOMETHING NOT RIGHT 
THESE ARE TWO 
STORIES OF MANY BOTH IN QUIET 
LOCATIONS POLICE SAY THAT ARE 
THEY ARE JUST WHAT THIEVES ARE 
SEARCHING FOR 
WE FOUND VEHICLES 
WITH CONCEALED TANKS IF THEY CAN 
APPROACH A TANK IN DARKNESS IF IT 
IS POORLY LIT THEY ARE AFRACTIVE 
TO THIEVE AND THEY CAN WORK ON 
THOSE 
NOW LIKE LAUREN THE ADVICE THOSE IS KEEP AN EYE OUT AND LOCK UP THIS 
EXPENSIVE COMMODITY IT IS NOT JUST 
LOCKS POLICE SAY USE LIGHT AND KEEP 
AN EYE ON THE LEVEL YOU CAN BUY 
SYSTEMS THAT REGISTER MANY YOUR 
HOUSE LET ME GIVE YOU AN IDEA FOR 
SU FECK LAST YEAR THERE WAS ONLY 
NINE PROPERTIES TARGETED THIS YEAR 
THERE HAS BEEN NINETEEN EIGHT IN NORFOLK TWENTY TWO 
IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE AND ELSEWHERE L. 
SPOKE TO A SALES PERSON THEY SAY 
THAT TWO PEOPLE A WEEK ARE RING 
THEM BUT THESE ARE JUST THE 
REPORTED ONES LET'S HAVE A CHAT 
AGAIN YOU DIDN'T REPORT IT WHY 
NOT 
WE REPORTED IT TO THE POLICE NOT BUT WE DIDN'T CLAIM ON THE 
INSURANCE BECAUSE OF THE NO CLAIMS 
BONUS 
IT WAS NOT WORT SNIT 
NO OUR BONUS EXCESS IS HIGH IT WOULD NOT HAVE 
BEEN WORTH CLAIMING BUT WE WERE 
COVERED 
THANK YOU WELL FROM US COVERED BACK TKWROUFPLT TO YOU WE ARE 
PLAYING WITH OUR TOYS AGAIN IF YOU 
ARE FEELING STRESSED THIS COMES 
FROM JAPAN AND IT IS THE 
TECHNOLOGICAL ELIVE QUENT E. LENT OF

TO WORK L. DON'T MIND THAT AT ALL 
IT IS GOOD 
THE NAME MEANS THE 
SOUND OF THE BUBBLES POPPING WE 
HAVE A PSYCHO THERAPIST WITH US 
WHY DO I NEED TO DO THIS BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU ARE STRESSED IT IS ANXIETY 
MAKING TALKING TO ME IT A 
DISPLACEMENT ACTIVITY WHEN YOU 
AGITATED YOU FIDDLE WITH YOUR 
FINGERS AND CLICK YOUR NAILS AND 
TWIDDLE YOUR HAIR BUT WITH THIS IT 
IS TAR K. ORIENTATED AS SOON AS YOU 
PRESS THE BUBBLE YOU GET THE POP

HOW ANNOYING 
IS THAT THE GREAT THING ABOUT 
PROPER BUBBLE WRAP IS YOU GET THE 
INSTANT HIT 
WITH WE DO OTHER 
THINGS LIKE FIDDLING WITH A PENCIL

WELL F. WE 
DIDN'T DO IT WE WOULD BE MORE DGE 
TAITED AND MORE WOUND UP WE HAVE 
BEEN UNPLEASANT TO BE AROUND AND 
WOULD LATE OUR OWN COMPANY IT IS A 
WAY OF LETTING THAT EMOTION OUT 
BUT IT IS NOT GOOD IN THE LONG TERM 
PARTICULARLY IF YOU DEVELOP A BALD 
PATCH OR YOU HAVE BITTEN NAILS 
YOU SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU 
STRESSED 
ARE THERE BETTER THINGS STRESSED TO DO THAN THIS 
I SHOULD IMAGINE 
SO BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU ALWAYS 
GOING TO BE FOCUS ONG SOMETHING

THIRD BUSTER THE ONE HUNDRED YEAR OLD HE 
FINISHED SAFELY THE MASAI WARRIORS 
I HAVE SPOKEN TO THEIR CHARITY 
THEY HAVE RAISED SIXTY THOUSAND THEY WERE 
LOOKING FOR ON THE WHOLE ALL 
PRESENT AND CORRECT 
YOU MAY REMEMBER A FEW WEEKS AGO WE 
SPOKE TO AN EXPLORER CALLED BEN 
SAUNDERS BEFORE HE SET OFF ON HIS 
MISSION TO BECOME THE FASTEST MAN 
TO REACH THE NORTH POLE ON FOOT 
WITHOUT THE AID OF DOGS LEADS AND 
RESUPPLY EYES OF FOOD 
AFTER DAYS OF BATTLING ON BEARABLE 
WEATHER EFFORTS HAVE TO BE CALLED 
OFF OFF I AM SORRY YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT WHY 
DIDN'T YOU MAKE IT 
TOUGH CONDITIONS AND EQUIPMENT 
FAILURE I BROKE THE SKI BINDINGS 
IT WAS DOWN TO TWO SMALL SCREWS 
THAT SNAPPED SO THE TINIEST OF 
THINGS THAT BROUGHT THE WHOLE THING 
GRINDING TO A HALT 
I KNOW THE 
SLEDGE ISN'T BIG BUT HE DID NOT 
HAVE THE EXTRA SCREWS 
I HAD A VERY 
SMALL REPAIR KIT IT WAS 
FRUSTRATING I COULD HAVE DONE WITH 
SOME OF THAT BUBBLE WRAP IF FELL 
LIKE A BROKEN LEG WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
MUCH BETTER REASON 
ALSO WHAT 
HAPPENED WITH THE DICE 
I STARTED 
ON THE NORTH COAST OF CANADA AND IT 
IS TO BE EXPECTED AT THE VERY START 
BUT I HAD IT FOR THE FIRST SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY 
MILES IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE 
SURFACE OF THE SEA THE FROZEN 
SURFACE OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN 
USUALLY IT DRIFTS TOWARDS THE COAST 
OF CANADA AND GREEN LAND WHICH 
MEANS YOU ARE NOT ONLY GOING UP THE 
DOWN ESCALATOR BUT IT IS BUMPING 
INTO THE COASTLINE THE THINNER THE 
ICE IS THE MORE COMPLICATED IT 
GETS IT HAS BEEN UNUSUALLY THIN 
IS THAT GLOBAL WARMING 
YES IT IS 
ONE MILLION SQUARE KILOMETRES LESS 
THAN THE YEAR BEFORE THAT IS TWICE 
THE SIZE OF FRANCE SO AN UNUSUALLY 
WARM SUMMER LAST YEAR MAYBE THE 
SAME THIS YEAR 
DOES THAT MAKE IT A 
SPECIAL DANGERS 
IT DOES IT MEANS 
THE ICE WILL BE VERY THIN LATER ON 
AND THE CHANCE OF ME ENCOUNTERING 
OPEN WATER WERE VERY HIGH SO IT 
INCREASED THE RISK 
WHEN YOUR 
BINDINGS HAVE BROKEN DO YOU HAVE 
TO TURN BACK AND WALK 
I WAS PICKED 
UP BY HELICOPTER 
IF THE ICE IS 
SHRINKING IT MAKES THE DISTANCE 
SHORTER DOESN'T IT 
NO IT JUST 
MEANS THE TIME YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN 
HIS LESS 
IF THIS WERE THE PATTERN 
CONTINUES IS IT NOT GOING TO WORK 
ANY MORE PEOPLE TRYING TO DO YOUR 
KIND OF EXPEDITIONS 
I THINK WE ARE 
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND I AM 
FOLLOWING SATELLITE IMAGES CLOSELY 
IT DOES LOOK BAD AT THE MOMENT L. 
WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT 
IT IS GOING TO GET LIKE THAT SOON 
HE SPENT ALL THOSE MONTHS PREPARING 
FOR THIS TRIP AND JUST SKI BINDINGS 
GO 
I REMEMBER READING PAULA GO RADCLIFFE COULD NOT RUN ON SUNDAY 
BECAUSE OF AN INJURY TO HER TONE 
ALL OF THE SMALL THINGS IN MANY 
WAYS I AM HAPPY I GOT OUT THERE TO 
TRY I ALWAYS MAINTAIN IT WASN'T 
ABOUT CONVENTIONAL EDWARDIAN STYLE 
EXPLORING BUT PUSHING MY POTENTIAL 
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT ANOTHER WAY 
TO EXPLORE YOUR POTENTIAL 
I AM 
HEADING TO ANTARCTICA IN OCTOBER 
TO DO THE FIRST RETURN JOURNEY 
WERE YOU RUN INTO ANY ICE PROBLEMS 
THERE 
HOPEFULLY NOT IT IS OVER THERE LAND 
YOU CANNOT STOP THEM CAN YOU LAND RATHER HIM THAN ME 
COMING UP IN A MOMENT A LOOK AT 
HOW HAYFEVER SUFFERERS CAN TACKLE 
THE PROBLEM A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK 
THEY HAVE A COLD WHEN THEY HAVE 
HEY FEVER 
NOW THE WEATHER 
LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING TO THE 
MEDIUM THE HEY FEVER LEVELS TODAY 
FROM THE BIRCH TREES PEOPLE DON'T 
EXPECT IT THIS TIME OF YEAR SO 
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MEDICATION IT 
IS SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS WHEN TREE 
POLLEN IS VERY BAD IN TERMS OF THE 
WEATHER TODAY IT IS FRESH BUT IT 
IS A GLORIOUS ONE IN TERMS OF 
SUNSHINE BUT IT WILL BE A CASE OF 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS FOR MANY TODAY 
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD 
AROUND RAIN THROUGH THE SOUTH OF 
SCOTLAND THE SOUTH EAST AND 
TRAILING INTO THE NORTH EAST OF 
ENGLAND THAT WILL FRAGMENT AND WE 
WILL SEE SOME SHARP SHOWERS 
DEVELOPING IN EASTERN ENGLAND AND 
THE SOUTH EAST CORNER YOU MIGHT BE 
LUCKY YOU MIGHT ESCAPE THE SHOWERS 
COMPLETELY THERE IS LIKELY TO BE 
FREQUENT SHOWERS AND THE SOUTH 
EASTERN CORNER AND EAST ANGLIA AND 
SOME OF THEM WILL BE SLOW MOVING 
THAT EXTENDS FURTHER NORTH ACROSS 
THE PEAKS AND THE PENNINES IN 
SCOTLAND IT SHOULD BE A DRIER 
AFTERNOON WITH THE CLOUD BREAKING 
UP AND MAYBE SUNNY SPELLS COMING 
THROUGH A PROMISING AFTERNOON FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND THAT WEATHER 
EXTENDS INTO THE ISLE OF MAN WHEN 
YOU TRAVEL INTO WALES FURTHER 
INLAND THERE IS LIKELY TO BE 
SHOWERS IN SHELTERED SOUTHERLY 
AREAS OF WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
WE SAID STREET SHOULD SEEK RAIN 
IT IS A LOTTERY WHETHER YOU WILL 
GET THE SHOWERS THE MOST FREQUENT 
WILL BE IN EAST ANGLIA THIS 
AFTERNOON THIS TEMPERATURE IS 
BETWEEN EIGHT AND TWELVE DEGREES THE 
SHOWERS THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT 
WILL EASE AWAY SKY'S WILL CONTINUE 
TO CLEAR A BAND OF RAIN DRIFTING 
OUT OF SCOTLAND HE COULD BE A COLD 
NIGHT WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 
CITIES CLOSE TO FREEZING THAT RAIN 
WILL SINK OUT OF SCOTLAND INTO THE 
NORTH OF ENGLAND AND FRAGMENT 
SHOWERY BITS AND PIECES INTO NORTH 
WALES AND THE MIDLANDS THE SOUTH 
SHOULD BE A TRIER AND PROMISING 
PICTURE TOMORROW IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND AGAIN IT STAYS BRIGHT AND 
SUNNY A MAXIMUM OF TWELVE DEGREES 
THE N. H. S. IT SEEMS IS IGNORING THE 
IMPORTANT ROLES OF FATHERS AFTER 
THE BIRTH THE FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE 
SAYS THE OLD FASHIONED IMAGE OF A 
FATHER CELEBRATING WITH FRIENDS AND 
A FEW BEERS WHILE HIS WIFE GIVE 
BIRTH IS A THING OF THE PAST 
RICHARD BEAN IS A FATHER A LITTLE 
GIRL CALLED MAISIE AND HE IS WITH 
BELINDA PHIPPS FROM THE NATIONAL 
CHILDBIRTH TRUST WHAT HAPPENED TO 
YOU YOU WE HAD GONE THROUGH QUITE LONG 
LABOUR WITH MY WIFE SALLY WHEN 
MAISIE WAS BORN SHE HAD TO BE 
INDUCED AND THEN WE ENDED UP HAVING 
AN EMERGENCY CAESAREAN SECTION THE 
NEIGHBOUR WENT O. K. WE SPENT SOME 
TIME WITH MAISIE DURING THE DAY AND 
IT GOT TO TEN P. M. AT NIGHT AND THEN I 
HAD TO GO 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN 
THERE BEFORE YOU WERE KICKED OUT OF 
THE HOSPITAL 
I WAS QUITE LUCKY IN 
THE SENSE THAT MAISIE WAS DELIVERED 
MID MORNING SO I HAD BEEN THERE 
ALL DAY 
DO YOU FEEL YOU SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN THERE LONGER 
YES JUST 
WHEN SALLY NEEDED ME THE MOST 
THIS LADY SAYS I HAD MY FOURTH BABY 
LAST JUNE AND MY HUSBAND WAS TOLD 
TO LEAVE WHEN I WAS IN THE BATH 
DIRECTLY AFTER GIVING BIRTH BECAUSE 
IT WAS THREE A M. 
IS THAT A COMMON STORY 
MOST OF THE BIG CONSULTANTS UNITS 
ARE SET UP BECAUSE YOU GIVE BIRTH 
IN ONE ROOM AND THEN BE TRANSFERRED 
TO A POST NATAL WARD WHERE THERE 
ARE LOTS OF WOMEN SO THAT DAD IS 
SENT HOME IF YOU ARE A DAB OF 
EXPECTING A BABY THE BEST CHANCE 
OF BEING WITH YOUR BABY AND AFTER 
BIRTH IS TO EITHER HAVE A HOME 
BIRTH OR GO TO A BIRTH CENTRE WHERE 
THEY HAVE SINGLE ROOMS FOR COUPLES 
THAT ARE EXPECTING A BABY AND A 
DAD CAN STAY 
THE WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE A 
WAY TO ADAPT THE SYSTEM SOMEHOW SO 
THAT FOR UNEXPECTED LATE BIRTHS 
THERE IS SOMEWHERE FOR THE DAD TO 
STAY HE HAS JUST NOT BEEN PART OF 
THE HISTORY OF THE MATERNITY 
SERVICES 
THERE WAS A CAMPAIGN SERVICES ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO FOR DADS TO BE 
THERE AT ALL AT THE BIRTH TO BE 
THERE AT THE BIRTH AT ALL IT IS 
JUST NOT THE WAY THAT THE HEALTH 
SERVICE THINKS IT REGARDS THIS AS 
A SOCIAL ISSUE NOT AS A HEALTH 
BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR 
MUMS AND DADS THAT THEY ARE 
TOGETHER SO THE ADVICE IS THINK 
ABOUT A HOME BIRTH LOOK AT A BIRTH 
CENTRE MOST MAIN MATERNITY UNITS 
CANNOT COPE WITH IT 
YOU KNOW THE 
CONSTRAINTS ON THE N. H. S. BECAUSE 
YOU'RE AN N. H. S. MANAGER YOURSELF SO 
HOW COULD THE SYSTEM BE IMPROVED 
WITHOUT MASSIVE FINANCIAL 
INVESTMENT AND WHAT DIFFERENCE 
WOULD IT MAKE 
IT WOULD HAVE MADE A 
HUGE DIFFERENCE TO ME AND MY WIFE 
IF I HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO STAY L. 
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE 
CONSTRAINTS WITHIN THE WARDS BUT 
THE SECOND DAY MY WIFE WAS IN 
HOSPITAL SHE WAS IN A SIDE ROOM 
BECAUSE SHE HAD HAD A CAESAREAN 
SECTION WHICH WAS FAIRLY COMMON 
PRACTICE AND I WAS STILL TOLD NO 
YOU CAN'T STAY EVEN THOUGH IT IS 
AWAY FROM EVERYBODY ELSE L. DID 
EVENTUALLY STAY BUT ONLY BY BEGGING 
AND I WAS SMUGGLED INTO THE ROOM 
AND TOLD NOT TO APPEAR UNTIL 
FOLLOWING MORNING 
MARK SAYS HIS 
PARTNER GAVE BIRTH TO THEIR FIRST 
CHILD LAST YEAR THE NURSES TOLD 
HIM HE HAD TO LEAVE AND COME BACK 
THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WAS 
NOWHERE NEAR HIS HOME SO HE HAD TO 
WANDER AROUND THE STREETS IN THE 
DARK UNTIL HE WAS ALLOWED IN TO SEE 
HIS KID AGAIN IT SEEMS ALMOST 
CRUEL REALLY 
IT IS TIME THAT WE 
CHANGED OUR MATERNITY UNITS AND AS 
I SAY THE BIRTH CENTRES DOES DOES EVERY TRUST HAVE A BIRTH CENTRE NO NO THEY DON'T WHICH IS THE SAD THING 
SOME TRUSTS HAVE GOT BIRTH CENTRES 
AND ONE THING WHICH WE ARE CALLING 
FOR IS MORE BIRTH CENTRES SO DADS 
TO HAVE THAT OPTION SOMETHING SOMETHING WHICH IS ALSO COMING THROUGH 
AMAZING STORIES SOME PEOPLE SAYING 
THEY HAVE GIVEN BIRTH ON THE N. H. S. 
OVER SEVENTEEN YEARS AND NOTHING HAS 
IMPROVED OVER THAT TIME TO 
ENCOURAGE BONDING FOR THE FATHER 
THIRTY YEARS AGO DOUBTS WERE NOT 
ALLOWED IN AT ALL THAT HAS CHANGED 
SOMETHING LIKE NINETY PER CENT OF WOMEN HAVE 
THE BABY'S DAD WITH THEM FOR THE 
BIRTH BUT THEY HAVE NOT GOT 
FACILITIES MOST OF THEM FOR 
STAYING OVERNIGHT IT IS DIFFICULT 
FOR YOU TO SEPARATE FROM YOUR 
PARTNER WHEN YOU HAVE JUST HAD A 
BABY BABY THANKS FOR ALL OF YOUR E. MAILS AND 
TEXTS WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH THE MORTGAGE CRISIS 
REPOSSESSIONS ARE ON THE INCREASE 
DECLAN IS AT A SPECIAL ADVICE 
CENTRE IN LEEDS HELLO 
WE ARE AT THE OFFICES OF THE 
CONSUMER CREDIT COUNSELLING SERVICE 
IT'S THE BIGGEST DEBT ADVICE 
CHARITY IN THE COUNTRY AND THEY'VE 
BEEN SO WORRIED ABOUT THE RISK OF 
REPOSSESSION THE RISK OF MORE 
PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES THAT A 
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THEY SET UP 
THIS A SPECIALIST ADVICE CENTRE 
WITH PEOPLE WHO CAN GIVE YOU SOME 
PRACTICAL HELP IF YOU WERE IN 
DANGER OF LOSING YOUR HOME OR IF 
YOU HAVE FALLEN BEHIND WITH YOUR 
MORTGAGE PAYMENTS THAT MIGHT NOT 
BE YOU BUT IT MAY BE SOMEONE THAT 
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE ARE A 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES 
AND THAT NUMBER IS RISING THERE 
WERE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND REPOSSESSIONS LAST YEAR 
STILL WELL BELOW THE PEAK WE SAW IN 
THE NINETEEN NINETIES BUT IT IS RISING AND IT 
IS EXPECTED TO BE BIGGER AGAIN THIS 
YEAR AS MORE HOMEOWNERS FACE 
RISING MORTGAGE COSTS BECAUSE AS 
BILL SAID BECAUSE OF THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH THOSE ARE THE STATS BUT 
BEHIND ALL OF THAT THERE ARE HUMAN 
STORIES EACH ONE IS A TALE OF 
STRESS AND MISERY WE HAVE BEEN 
TALKING TO ONE HOME OWNER AND HE 
MISSED MORTGAGE PAYMENTS BECAUSE HE 
FELL ILL AND HAD TO STOP WORK FOR 
JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BUT 
EVEN THAT WAS ENOUGH TO STRETCH HIS 
FINANCES TO BREAKING POINT HE 
FOUND THAT IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG 
BEFORE HIS HOME WAS UNDER THREAT 
TOO 
APPARENTLY THE LENDERS HAD TOO REPOSSESSED THE HOUSE AND APPLIED 
TO THE COURTS AND FOR SIX MONTHS 
I HAD BEEN RECEIVING MAIL AT FIRST 
I WAS TRYING TO DEAL WITH EVERY 
PIECE OF MALE UNTIL SUCH TIME WHEN 
I JUST WAS EXHAUSTED I COULDN'T 
COPE WITH IT I WAS INUNDATED WITH 
IT I LEFT MANY OF THEM UNOPENED 
AND THE CASE FOR MY HOUSE 
REPOSSESSION HAD GONE THROUGH THE 
COURTS BY DEFAULT WITHOUT ME EVEN 
DEFENDING IT SO AS A CONSEQUENCE 
OF THIS BY DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX THE 
COURT BAILIFF FROM THE GLOUCESTER 
TOM COURT KNOCKED ON MY DOOR AND 
SAID I'VE GOT TO SERVE YOU WITH 
THESE PAPERS YOUR HOUSE IS AN 
EVICTION THE COURT BAILIFF FROM 
THE GLOUCESTER TOWN COURT 
I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT 
TELEPHONE NUMBER AGAIN HERE IT 
IS 
THIS IS THE HELPLINE NUMBER FOR 
SPECIALIST ASSISTANCE IF YOU ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT YOUR MORTGAGE 
PAYMENTS OR EVEN IF YOU ARE IN 
DANGER OF LOSING YOUR HOME JOINING 
ME NOW A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
CREDIT COUNSELLING SERVICE AND THE 
PHONES HAVE BEEN RINGING HOT ALL 
MORNING THERE HAVE EVEN BEEN SOME 
CASES OF PEOPLE WHO WERE IN DANGER 
OF BEING TOLD THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR 
HOMES TODAY 
ABSOLUTELY THERE 
HAS BEEN A WIDE RANGE OF CALLS 
WHAT IS CONCERNING IS THE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE WHO ARE RINGING LARGEST 
ABOUT TO GO TO COURT FOR A 
REPOSSESSION HEARING WE CAN STILL 
DO SOMETHING TO HELP THEM THAT'S 
NOT A PROBLEM PLEASE RING US THE 
FACT IS THE EARLY YOU CONTACT US 
THE MORE WE CAN DO WE HAVE ALREADY 
HELPED ONE LADY THIS MORNING AND 
POSSIBLY MAY NOT LOSE HER HOME NOW 
WHICH IS GOOD NEWS 
EVEN THOUGH IT 
LOOKED LIKE THE LAST THROW OF THE 
DICE IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HER TO SAVE 
HER HOME 
IT HAS BEEN ENOUGH FOR US 
TO HELP HER SO THAT SHE CAN GO TO 
COURT AND MAKE AN OFFER OF A 
REPAYMENT AND IT IS HIGHLY 
UNLIKELY THE LENDER WILL GO VERY 
REPOSSESSION ORDER IT IS NEVER TOO 
LATE NO MATTER HOW DESPERATE THE 
SITUATION NOT AT ALL MAKE THAT 
CALL 
SOMETIMES IT MEANS NOT CALL IGNORING THE PROBLEM NOT PUTTING 
THOSE LETTERS FROM THE BANK OR 
BUILDING SOCIETY IN THE DRAW AND 
HOPING THAT THEY WILL GO AWAY 
ABSOLUTELY AS SOON AS SOMEONE 
MISSES ONE PAYMENT THEY ARE ON A 
VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE THE SOONER 
THIS TAKE ACTION THE MORE WE CAN 
DO TO HELP THEM THE SOONER THEY 
TAKE ACTION 
IT IS NOT PRE ORDAINED 
JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE MISSED A 
COUPLE OF PAYMENTS IT DOES NOT 
MEAN THAT AUTOMATICALLY YOU WILL 
LOSE YOUR HOME ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT IF THEY 
ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY MAKING A 
PAYMENT OR IF THEY HAVE MISSED 
PAYMENTS TALK TO SOMEONE AS SOON 
AS YOU CAN TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE 
SITUATION 
BUT IT REQUIRES YOU TO SITUATION GO TO SOMEONE AND SAY PLEASE HELP 
ME FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT IS A 
HARD THING TO DO 
IT IS A BIG STEP 
FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE BUT THE 
ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT THEY 
COULD LOSE THEIR HOME SO TALK TO 
SOMEONE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER 
AND YOU COULD STOP THAT HAPPENING 
WE'RE NOT HERE TO JUDGE WHAT PEOPLE 
HAVE DONE WE'RE HERE TO BE HELPFUL 
IMPARTIAL AND GIVE YOU THE BEST 
ADVICE WE CAN TO KEEP THE ROOF OVER 
THEIR HEADS 
LET ME GIVE YOU THAT HELPLINE 
NUMBER AGAIN JUST IN CASE YOU DID 
NOT HAVE PEN AND PAPER LAST TIME 
REMEMBER IT'S NOT TOO LATE EVEN 
IF YOU THINK ALL HOPE IS LOST 
THERE IS STILL POSSIBILITY THAT YOU 
COULD GET ASSISTANCE THAT COULD 
HELP YOU HOLD ON TO YOUR HOME BUT 
BEAR IN MIND AS WELL IN SOME CASES 
YOU'RE IN DIFFICULTY BECAUSE YOU 
JUST CANNOT AFFORD THE MORTGAGE 
AND IN THOSE CASES THERE IS NOT 
MUCH THAT ANYONE CAN DO EXCEPT 
MANAGE IT PROPERLY AND MAKE SURE 
THAT YOU LOSE OUT THE LEAST 
STREAMING EYES A RUNNY NOSE 
COUGHING AND SNEEZING DON'T YOU 
LOVE IT THE HAYFEVER SEASON IS 
UPON US AGAIN UP TO FIVE MILLION 
PEOPLE COULD BE SUFFERING 
UNNECESSARILY BECAUSE ACCORDING TO 
THE ROYAL PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY 
THEY ARE NOT GETTING THE RIGHT 
TREATMENT APPARENTLY THAT IS 
BECAUSE MANY OF US MISTAKE ANALOGY 
TO POLLEN FOR COLD HOW CAN WE 
TELL THE DIFFERENCE LET'S FIND OUT 
NOW WITH MELINDA MESSENGER WHOSE 
SIX YEAR OLD SON WENT TO HOSPITAL 
BECAUSE OF FEVER HOW OR YOU ALL 
RIGHT NOT SNEEZING NO WHAT 
HAPPENED MELINDA 
WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TWO I NOTICED HE 
HAD A VERY SUDDEN AND QUITE EXTREME 
REACTION AND THE WHITES OF HIS I 
BECAME QUITE DISTORTED SO MUCH SO 
THAT IT WAS COMING UP OVER THE BLUE 
OF HIS IRIS WHICH SENT ME AS YOU 
CAN IMAGINE INTO AN ABSOLUTE PANIC 
BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS 
WRONG HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER 
SYMPTOMS ABOUT POINT L. RUSHED HIM 
UP TO A AND AMP E. SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED 
TO HIS EYES AND THEY VERY CALMLY 
LOOK AT HIM AND SAID IT'S AN 
ALLERGIC REACTION I DID NOT KNOW 
TO WHAT AT THAT STAGE IT HAPPENED 
AGAIN AND I WENT TO THE G. P. AND IT 
TURNED OUT THAT HE SUFFERS WITH 
HAYFEVER 
IT TO DO SOME TIME TO HAYFEVER WORK IT OUT 
IT DID BECAUSE THE 
SYMPTOMS ARE SO EASILY 
MISUNDERSTOOD IT TOOK YOU SOME 
TIME THIS IS WHAT THIS NEW 
RESEARCH SHOWS A LOT OF PEOPLE 
JUST THINK IT IS A COLD I KNOW 
THAT I GET IT AND I OFTEN THINK 
IT'S JUST A COLD A RUNNY NOSE AND 
THAT'S IT BUT THE REALITY IS THAT 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER YOU CAN 
GET TREATMENT FOR IT QUITE EASILY 
SO WHAT OTHER SYMPTOMS DOCTOR 
ROSEMARY ROSEMARY THE RUNNING NOSE AND THE BLOCKED 
NOSE ARE VERY SIMILAR TO A COLD 
BUT THE BIG GIVEAWAY IS THAT YOU 
HAVE AN ITCHY THROAT AND OFTEN 
ITCHY EYES AS WELL AND SOME PEOPLE 
WITH HAYFEVER FEEL REALLY ROTTEN 
WITH IT IN THE SUMMER IN JUNE 
PEOPLE EXPECT TO HAVE IT THE 
PROBLEM IS NOW WHEN PEOPLE THINK 
IT IS TOO EARLY TO HAVE FEVER 
BUT THERE IS AN INCREASING PROBLEM 
WITH ALLERGIES TO TREE POLLENS 
PARTICULARLY BIRCH POLLEN SOME OF 
THE GRASSES ARE ALSO COMING IN 
EARLY IN THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE 
U. K. SO APRIL AND MAY CAN BE 
REALLY ROTTEN TIME IF YOU HAVE 
RUNNY NOSE WHICH STARTS OFF FAIRLY 
SUDDENLY AND YOU DON'T HAVE A 
TEMPERATURE YOU DON'T HAVE SORE 
THROAT THEN THINK HANG ON COULD 
THIS BE HAYFEVER THE OTHER THING 
IS THAT OLDER PEOPLE ARE GETTING IT 
WHO HAVE NEVER HAD IT BEFORE THEY 
SAY I CANNOT HAVE HAYFEVER OH 
YES YOU CAN 
THAT'S SOMETHING TO 
LOOK FORWARD TO ISN'T IT WHAT 
HAPPENS TO YOU SNEEZE LOT ERM ERM WE PUT GLASSES ON WE FIND THAT 
HELPS JUST TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF 
THINGS WHICH HE HAS COME INTO 
CONTACT WITH YOU HAVE GOT THREE 
KIDS 
YES THAT HE IS THE ONLY ONE KIDS WHO HAS SUFFERED FROM IT L. HAVE 
ALWAYS CLASSED MYSELF AS NOT BEING 
A HAYFEVER SUFFERER BUT 
INTERMITTENTLY I WILL GET IT THAT 
IS BIZARRE 
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE HAS 
QUITE A SEVERE ALLERGY TO IT YOU 
CAN CONTROL IT NOW 
YES I KEEP 
AN EYE ON IT AND WHEN IT LOOKS 
LIKE HE IS GETTING THE EARLY SIGNS 
AND I WILL GIVE HIM ANTIHISTAMINES 
BUT OTHER THAN THAT NOTHING ELSE 
REALLY THAT TENDS TO KEEP IT AT 
BAY 
THE MODERN ANTIHISTAMINES BAY SHOULD NOT MAKE YOU DROWSY THEY 
REALLY SHOULDN'T PEOPLE ARE STILL 
USING OLD FASHIONED ONES BECAUSE 
THE NAMES OF WELL KNOWN BUT THE 
MODERN ONES DO NOT MAKE YOU DROWSY 
THE MISTAKE PEOPLE MAKE IS WHEN 
THEY HAVE MORE SEVERE HAY FEVER A 
LOT OF THE ANTIHISTAMINES ARE JUST 
A ONE A DAY DOES BUT PEOPLE CRACK 
THE DOSE UP AND THAT IS WHEN YOU 
START GETTING SIDE EFFECTS EVEN 
WITH THE MODERN ANTIHISTAMINES SO SO PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE SEEKING SELF 
MEDICATION CAN THEY BUY IT OVER 
THE COUNTER 
THEY CAN BUT GO AND 
CHAT WITH THE PHARMACIST DO NOT 
RELY ON ANTIHISTAMINE TABLETS ALONE 
THERE ARE EYE DROPS AND NASAL 
SPRAYS OFTEN IT IS THE COMBINATION 
OF ALL THREE WHICH WORKS BEST 
AS A 
MOTHER WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND 
EXACTLY AS ROSEMARY SAID GO TO THE 
PHARMACIST IT IS NOT SOMETHING 
WHICH NECESSARILY YOU HAVE TO GO TO 
THE DOCTOR WITH THE LOCAL 
PHARMACIST WILL BE ABLE TO DIAGNOSE 
STRAIGHTAWAY AND THERE IS A WHOLE 
VARIETY OF MEDICATION

GOT A SEAT FIRST THE OTHER WOULD 
BECOME A LAWYER THEN YOU SAW HER 
WHOLE BODY LANGUAGE CHANGED YOU 
COULD SEE HER CONSTANTLY SMILING 
AND FEEL HER IMPULSE TO ANSWER THE 
QUESTIONS THEN SHE WAS FEELING 
QUITE SELF CONSCIOUS AGAIN ABOUT 
BEING IN THE PUBLIC EYE BUT BEING 
SILENT I WAS VERY CONSCIOUS OF
