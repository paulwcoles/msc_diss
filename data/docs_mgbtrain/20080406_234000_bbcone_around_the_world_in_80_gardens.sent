I BELIEVE THAT A REALLY GOOD WAY TO UNDERSTAND A CULTURE IS THROUGH ITS GARDENS 
THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY TO VISIT EIGHTY INSPIRING GARDENS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
SOME ARE VERY WELL KNOWN LIKE THE TAJ MAHAL OR THE ALHAMBRA 
AND I'M ALSO CHALLENGING MY IDEA OF WHAT A GARDEN ACTUALLY IS 
SO I'M VISITING GARDENS THAT FLOAT ON THE AMAZON 
A STRANGE FANTASY IN THE JUNGLE 
AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE HOMES OF GREAT DESIGNERS 
AND THE DESERT FLOWERING IN A GARDEN 
AND WHEREVER I GO I SHALL BE MEETING PEOPLE THAT SHARE MY OWN PASSION FOR GARDENS ON MY EPIC QUEST 
TO SEE THE WORLD THROUGH EIGHTY OF ITS MOST FASCINATING AND BEAUTIFUL GARDENS 
THIS WEEK I HAVE COME TO SOUTH AFRICA 
IT IS THE HOME OF SOME OF OUR BEST LOVED GARDEN PLANTS 
WHICH GROW IN SOME OF THE MOST DRAMATIC SCENERY IN THE WORLD 
YET I HAVE AVOIDED COMING HERE UNTIL NOW 
I GREW UP WITH A HATRED OF THE RACIAL SEGREGATION UNDER THE APARTHEID REGIME 
AND FELT THAT TO BE AN IMPASSABLE IDEOLOGICAL BARRIER TO THE ENJOYMENT OF THE BEAUTIES OF SOUTH AFRICA 
AND THAT VIEW I CONFESS FOSSILISED AND BLOCKED 
ALL FLORAL TEMPTATIONS TO VISIT 
BUT THAT'S HISTORY NOW AND ALTHOUGH I WOULD BE DISHONEST 
IF I SAID THAT I DIDN'T BRING A BIT OF THAT BAGGAGE WITH ME 
I REALLY WANT TO SEE THIS EXTRAORDINARY BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY 
TO MEET THE PEOPLE AND OF COURSE TO SEE AS MANY GARDENS AS I CAN 
I'M STARTING IN CAPE TOWN TO SEE HOW GARDENS REFLECT THE EMERGENCE 
OF SOUTH AFRICA AS A NATION AND I SHALL VISIT THE FAMOUS 
KIRSTENBOSCH BOTANIC GARDENS AMONGST OTHERS 
AND THEN GOING ON TO THE DRAKENSBERG MOUNTAINS 
TO SEE SOME OF OUR FAMILIAR GARDEN PLANTS GROWING IN THEIR EXHILARATING NATURAL ENVIRONMENT 
FINALLY I GO TO JOHANNESBURG 
TO SEE HOW ONE OF SOUTH AFRICA'S GRANDEST GARDENS IS CHANGING 
AS WELL AS A TOWNSHIP GARDEN THAT HAS DESPERATELY LIMITED RESOURCES BUT IS RICH IN HOPE AND INSPIRATION 
CAPE TOWN SITS BENEATH THE FAMOUS SILHOUETTE OF TABLE MOUNTAIN 
AND THIS PROVIDES THE BACKDROP FOR MY FIRST GARDEN 
I'VE DECIDED TO START MY JOURNEY HERE AT KIRSTENBOSCH BOTANICAL GARDEN 
AT THE BASE OF TABLE MOUNTAIN 
BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE VERY FEW BOTANIC GARDENS THAT JUST HAS NATIVE PLANTS 
SO IF YOU WANT TO SEE ALL THE PLANTS OF SOUTH AFRICA IN ONE PLACE WELL THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE TO COME 
THE GARDENS THEMSELVES EXTEND TO ALMOST ONE HUNDRED CAREFULLY TENDED ACRES 
BUT THIS IS ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED ACRE ESTATE 
THAT RUNS RIGHT TO THE VERY TOP OF TABLE MOUNTAIN 
WITH A MIXTURE OF WOODLAND AND THE INDIGENOUS SCRUB KNOWN AS FYNBOS 
THE LAND WAS BOUGHT BY CECIL RHODES IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
AND BEQUEATHED TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN PEOPLE AT HIS DEATH IN NINETEEN OH TWO 
IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN THE NATIONAL BOTANIC GARDEN OF SOUTH AFRICA 
DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO INDIGENOUS PLANTS WAS SET UP ON THE SITE 
I MET ONE OF THE SENIOR HORTICULTURALISTS CHERISE VILJOEN WHO OFFERED TO SHOW ME ROUND 
HOW MANY SOUTH AFRICAN PLANTS ARE THERE HERE 
IN THE GARDEN YEAH THERE ARE OVER SEVEN THOUSAND SPECIES 
OH THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
YEAH AND THERE'S STILL MORE TO GO AROUND 
WE'RE STILL ADDING TO THE COLLECTIONS EVERY DAY AND TO THE GARDEN 
AMONGST THIS HUGE DIVERSITY OF PLANTS 
THE GARDEN SPECIALISES IN LOCAL CAPE FLORA 
THE SHOWIEST OF THESE ARE THE PROTEAS 
OF WHICH THERE ARE OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DIFFERENT TYPES 
SO THESE ARE THE PINCUSHION FORMS NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING IS TO SEE A MASS OF THEM 
THEY DO MAKE A FANTASTIC DISPLAY AND REALLY BRING IT HOME TO YOU 
AND THEY'VE GOT QUITE A SWEET COMMON NAME IT'S FIROKISE IN AFRIKAANS 
AND IT MEANS MATCHES OR MATCHSTICKS 
CAN I PICK IT UP YEAH 
IT'S PERFECT ISN'T IT YOU JUST NEED A FLINT SEE THAT'S CHARMING 
AND THE THING THAT YOU ALWAYS FIND IS THE BIRDS ARE ALWAYS ON THEM 
SIPPING NECTAR OR DIGGING FOR A SEED 
THEN CHERISE TOOK ME TO SEE THE KING PROTEA THE NATIONAL FLOWER 
EXPECTING I'M SURE DELIGHT AND RAPTURE 
BUT I FEAR MY REACTION PROVED SOMETHING OF A DISAPPOINTMENT 
I'VE GOT SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL TO SHOW YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO STEP IN 
IT SAYS DON'T STEP IN THE BEDS I LIKE THAT YES BUT YOU'RE WITH ME YOU MAY STEP IN AND HERE IT IS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS 
IT'S AN UGLY FLOWER ISN'T IT 
IT'S A. NOW YOU SEE THIS 
I'VE SEEN PICTURES OF THIS SORT OF THING 
IT'S NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR ME I HAVE TO SAY ERM 
WELL IT REMINDS YOU OF AN ARTICHOKE 
ARTI IS RIGHT IT'S ARTIFICIAL RATHER THAN ARTICHOKE 
BUT THERE WE GO O. K. 
WELL YOU CAN'T LIKE THEM ALL 
BUT THE WILD PELARGONIUMS GROWING AS SPRAWLING SHRUBS THAT CHERISE SHOWED ME WERE A DELIGHT 
THESE ARE THE ANCESTORS OF OUR FAMILIAR CULTIVATED REGAL PELARGONIUMS 
AND IT WAS STRANGE TO SEE SOMETHING SO POWERFULLY CONNECTED TO MY CHILDHOOD GROWING HERE 
YOU JUST NEVER SEE THAT 
THIS GREAT DRIFT ON BIG PLANTS 
THIS IS A VERY NATURAL PLANTING THIS IS HOW YOU WOULD COME ACROSS IT GROWING WILD ON A MOUNTAINSIDE 
SOMETHING IS SMELLING WONDERFUL 
IT'LL BE THE SALVIA 
IS THIS A SALVIA IT'S A SALVIA 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A SALVIA IT'S OUR WILD AFRICAN SALVIA 
OH IT'S LOVELY IT'S LEMONY AND MUSKY AND WARM AND 
IT DEFINITELY CONTRIBUTES TO THE FYNBOS SCENT THAT YOU GET OFF THE 
THE VELDT WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH IT 
YOU SEE IF I'M HONEST I THINK 
OF WORDS LIKE THE VELDT IS A VERY BUTCH SORT OF WORD 
IT DOESN'T SAY MUSKY LEMONY FRAGRANCE 
NO IT DOESN'T WILD FIELDS DON'T 
WORK FOR US 
VELDT IS JUST VELDT IT'S A VERY 
IT'S AN AFRIKAANS WORD BUT IT'S TRADITIONALLY USED TO DESCRIBE THE WILD AREAS IN THE CAPE 
SOUTH AFRICA IS HOME TO TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DIFFERENT SPECIES OF FLOWERING PLANTS 
THAT'S ONE TENTH OF ALL THOSE THAT GROW ON EARTH 
THERE IS ALSO A SMALL GROUP OF PLANTS THAT WERE HERE LONG 
BEFORE FLOWERS EVEN EVOLVED THE CYCADS 
CYCADS LOOK LIKE PALM TREES BUT THEY DATE BACK TWO HUNDRED MILLION YEARS 
AND HAVEN'T CHANGED AT ALL SINCE THEY FINISHED EVOLVING FIFTY MILLION YEARS AGO 
IF YOU HAD TO GO BACK ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION YEARS IT WOULD PRETTY MUCH LOOK 
EXACTLY LIKE THAT EXCEPT THERE WOULD BE A GREAT BIG DINOSAUR BEHIND IT 
SO THEY HAVEN'T EVOLVED AT ALL 
VERY VERY LITTLE 
AND THEN AMONGST THIS JURASSIC FOLIAGE 
I SPOTTED SOMETHING THAT I FOUND AS THRILLING TO ME AS ANY DINOSAUR 
WELL HERE WE ARE WITH THE CYCADS AND ALSO AN OWLET 
A SPOTTED EAGLE OWL 
A SPOTTED EAGLE IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
MONTY HAVE YOU SPOTTED HER OH I CAN SEE HER 
GOOD THE MOTHER OWL HOW AMAZING 
YOU'RE A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL 
ISN'T THAT AMAZING ISN'T THAT JUST AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE 
IT'S NICE TO SEE WHAT THE CHICK IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHEN HE LOSES ALL HIS FLUFF AS WELL WE'RE BLESSED 
MONTY IF WE GO DOWN HERE I CAN SHOW YOU A REALLY HORRID CYCAD 
IT'S KIND OF LIKE ORGANIC BARBED WIRE 
AREN'T THEY TRULY TRULY HORRID 
ENCEPHALARTOS HORRIDUS 
THEY'RE A SPIKY THING THEY REALLY ARE 
I GUESS WHEN YOU GET SPIKED BY THAT YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN SPIKED 
AND THAT IS ENTIRELY DESIGNED TO STOP DINOSAUR JAWS YES 
SEE I THINK THEY'RE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE KING PROTEA 
I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA FALL BACK TO THAT ONE IT'S TRUE 
I WAS A BIT DAUNTED 
WHEN I CAME HERE AND I THINK THAT WAS AS MUCH AS ANYTHING 
THROUGH MY SENSE OF NOT KNOWING ENOUGH ABOUT SOUTH AFRICAN PLANTS 
ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT TODAY FOR ME IS THAT I REALISE I KNOW MORE THAN I THOUGHT I DID 
HOWEVER THE MAJORITY HERE IS NEW AND UNUSUAL 
AND IT'S REALLY GOOD TO SEE THEM ALL IN SETTING AND IN CONTEXT 
THAT'S WHAT A BOTANICAL GARDEN IS LIKE A REFERENCE LIBRARY 
PUT THAT AGAINST THIS EXTRAORDINARY BACKDROP IT REALLY IS SO BEAUTIFUL 
AND THEN THAT MAKES FOR A FASCINATING AND BEAUTIFUL WAY 
TO BEGIN THIS JOURNEY 
BUT I THINK WITH THIS EXPERIENCE AND FEELING A BIT MORE CONFIDENT 
I THINK THE NEXT STEP IS TO GO AND SEE THESE SAME PLANTS 
IN A MUCH MORE HUMAN CONTEXT 
SOMEWHERE MODERN SOMEWHERE QUIRKY AND UTTERLY DIFFERENT TO THIS 
SO I'M GOING A COUPLE OF HOURS EAST OF THE CITY TO FRANSCHHOEK 
WHICH IS A SMALL TOWN NEAR TO STELLENBOSCH 
THE INTELLECTUAL CENTRE FOR AFRIKANERS 
AS WE TRAVEL I GET A GLIMPSE OF A DIFFERENT FACET OF LIFE IN SOUTH AFRICA 
JUST ON THE LEFT 
IS A TOWNSHIP WHICH IS JUST A SERIES OF SHACKS TINY SHACKS 
LOOKING MORE LIKE ALLOTMENT SHEDS THAN HOUSES 
WE LEAVE CAPE TOWN AND COME INTO A COUNTRYSIDE OF ORCHARDS AND VINEYARDS 
AT THE FOOT OF THE HIGH MOUNTAINS THAT DEFINED THE LIMITS 
OF THE CAPE COLONISATION FOR CENTURIES 
THE HUGUENOTS ARRIVING IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT 
BASED THEIR VINEYARDS THERE AND FRANSCHHOEK MEANS FRENCH CORNER 
I'M HERE TO SEE THE GARDEN OF HENK SCHOLTZ 
A GARDEN DESIGNER AND ARTIST 
THIS IS A SMALL GARDEN THAT CIRCLES AROUND THE HOUSE 
THE FRONT PATH RUNS BETWEEN BEDS CONTAINING NATIVE STRELITZIAS 
FRAMED AND CONTAINED BY TIGHTLY CLIPPED PRIVET HEDGES 
AT THE BACK HENK HAS A SEMI CIRCULAR LAWN 
AND A VERANDAH THAT RUNS THE LENGTH OF THE HOUSE 
WITH STUPENDOUS VIEWS OUT TO THE MOUNTAINS 
YOU DO HAVE THIS AMAZING BORROWED LANDSCAPE 
I MEAN IT IS ABOUT AS DRAMATIC AS IT COULD BE ISN'T IT 
NO I MEAN IT'S SPECTACULAR 
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE SECRET OF A SMALL GARDEN BECAUSE THERE IS A GREAT FAILING IT SEEMS TO ME 
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY IF ONLY I HAD A BIGGER GARDEN EVERYTHING WOULD BE O. K. 
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT AT ALL 
FOR ME IT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH THAT SPACE NUMBER ONE 
FIRST OF ALL IT'S TO DIVIDE IT UP IN AS MANY SPACES AS POSSIBLE 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SOLID WALL OR A SOLID HEDGE 
IF YOU STEP DOWN THE STEPS DOWN TO THIS LAWN SPACE YOU'RE IN A TOTAL DIFFERENT ROOM 
I LOVE THIS SPACE 
I ENJOY THIS SPACE 
FOR ME THIS IS MY PALETTE WHERE I PLAY 
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN A GARDEN SO INTENSELY DETAILED 
SOME OF THIS IS PLAYFUL AND SOME VERY PRACTICAL LIKE THE STEEP ANGLE OR BATTER ON THE HEDGES 
IN THE U. K. YOU REALLY DON'T SEE THAT NO THEY TEND TO BE CUT STRAIGHT 
THAT'S FOR THE MAXIMUM SUN ON BOTH SIDES AND YOU GET A BETTER GROWTH AND THAT AVOIDS ALL THE DEAD ENDS 
AND WHAT IS THIS THIS IS LIGUSTRUM 
IT IS A PRIVET YEAH YOU SEE YOU VERY RARELY SEE A PRIVET 
IN THE U. K. USED FOR A LOW HEDGE 
REALLY YEAH 
BETWEEN THE PRIVET HEDGES AND THE BOUNDARY FENCE WERE CLIPPED BALLS OF PLUMBAGO 
WHICH I HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS A SPRAWLY HOUSE PLANT 
HENK DOESN'T ONLY SHAPE HIS PLANTS BUT HIS SCULPTURES MADE 
FROM RECYCLED MATERIALS ARE ALSO AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE GARDEN 
FLOATING IMPLEMENTS JUST BLOW IN THE WIND 
LOVELY REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND I LIKE YOUR WATER FEATURE I SUPPOSE IS WHAT IT IS 
THAT'S BASICALLY AN OLD SOUTH AFRICAN VERSION OF FENG SHUI RIGHT O. K. 
THAT'S MY SECURITY GUARD YEAH 
I CAN SEE SHE'S WITH THE MEDUSA OUTFIT 
SHE'S A BEAUTY A GREAT BEAUTY 
EVERYTHING IN THE GARDEN IS TWEAKED TRIMMED OR ADORNED I LOVE 
AS OBVIOUSLY ONE WOULD ALL THE LITTLE TOUCHES IN THIS GARDEN THANK YOU 
AND THERE ARE A LOT IT'S FOUND OBJECTS 
ALTHOUGH SMALL AT EVERY TURN THERE IS A NEW COMPOSED VIEW 
THE LAWN IS DESCRIBING THE CIRCLE 
ABSOLUTELY AND I REALLY LIKE THAT 
AND THIS IS LOVELY 
I REALLY LIKE THIS THE WAY THAT 
IT'S ENCLOSED IN AND THIS THE CURVES OF THE HEDGE 
IT BASICALLY GROWS ON YOU IT'S LIKE AN ORGANIC THING THAT'S ALIVE 
YOU CAN BASICALLY SHAKE THIS THING I MEAN IT'S LIKE 
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE CALL RAGODA RAGODA STARTA LIKE SALTBUSH 
SMELL YOUR HANDS AND THEN YOU'LL STOP DOING THAT 
IT SMELLS DEAR VIEWER 
OF SLIGHTLY OFF FISH 
NOW HE TELLS ME BUT IT CLIPS BEAUTIFULLY 
YEAH INDEED 
HENK TOLD ME THAT HE TRIMS THE ENTIRE GARDEN EVERY TWELVE DAYS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 
AND THE COMBINATION OF HIS TIGHT CLIPPING AND IDIOSYNCRATIC PLAYFULNESS IS EVIDENT EVERYWHERE 
AND THE FLOWERING PLANTS SEEM TO THRIVE SPECTACULARLY ON HIS REGIME 
IT'S THE MOST FLORIFEROUS TRACHELOSPERMUM 
I HAVE EVER SEEN SURE 
I MUST SAY IT'S EXTREMELY HAPPY 
AND THAT'S JUST ONE PLANT 
THAT'S ONE PLANT THAT'S IN THAT SPACE AMAZING 
YEAH 
AND SUDDENLY THIS MUTED PALETTE BECOMES SHOCKING PINK WITH THE BOUGAINVILLEA 
AND I LOVE THE WHERE I'M STANDING NOW THAT CURVE IS PERFECT YEAH 
VERY BEAUTIFUL INDEED 
AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST PHOTOGENIC GARDEN I'VE EVER BEEN TO 
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK YOU TURN YOUR HEAD AND THERE'S A PICTURE 
I LOVE THE WAY THAT IT'S THE EXPRESSION OF ONE MAN'S WORK THAT IT'S PERSONAL AND IT'S QUIRKY 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SCULPTURE AND THE PLANTS 
AND THE DESIGN THE WHOLE THING HAS BEEN FABULOUS 
AND I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE WAY THAT IT'S USED INDIGENOUS PLANTS 
THAT IT'S AN EXPRESSION OF SOUTH AFRICAN GARDENING AND ART 
AND AFTER ALL THAT'S WHAT I CAME HERE TO SEE 
SO THAT'S THAT'S BEEN VERY INSPIRATIONAL 
BUT THE NEXT STOP IS A COMPLETE CONTRAST 
I WANT TO BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF CAPE TOWN 
AND REALLY SEE WHERE ALL THIS BEGAN 
SEE WHERE AND HOW THE FIRST SOUTH AFRICAN GARDENS STARTED 
THE FIRST SOUTH AFRICAN GARDEN IS BOUND UP WITH THE STORY 
OF THE DUTCH EAST INDIA COMPANY 
BY THE TIME THAT THEIR SHIPS WOULD ROUND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE 
ON THEIR WAY TO THE FAR EAST THE CREWS WOULD BE EXHAUSTED 
AND OFTEN SUFFERING TERRIBLY FROM SCURVY AFTER ANYTHING UP TO SIX MONTHS AT SEA AFTER LEAVING HOLLAND 
TABLE MOUNTAIN STOOD OUT 
FROM AN OTHERWISE VERY LEVEL AND BLAND COASTLINE 
THIS MEANT THAT SAILORS USED IT TO NAVIGATE 
AND IT BECAME A MAJOR LANDMARK ON THE LONG LONG JOURNEY 
SO IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY TWO A SMALL GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN COLONISERS SET ASHORE 
AT ITS BASE SPECIFICALLY TO CULTIVATE GROUND THAT COULD SUPPLY 
THE SHIPS WITH FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 
THIS WAS IMMEDIATELY A SUCCESS 
AND THAT INITIAL GARDEN EXPANDED TO BECOME THE COMPANY GARDEN 
MOST OF IT STILL SURVIVES AS A PUBLIC PARK 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY 
AND THIS TREE IS A REMNANT FROM THAT FIRST GARDEN 
THIS IS PYRUS COMMUNIS IT'S A PEAR 
IT'S GOT THESE EVERGREEN 
RATHER LEATHERY LEAVES THAT ARE NOT TYPICAL OF A PEAR 
BUT I'VE GOT ONE IN MY OWN GARDEN IT'S INDIGENOUS TO NORTHERN EUROPE 
AND THIS IS A SURVIVOR FROM THOSE DAYS 
PEOPLE DIDN'T FOUND THE INITIAL COLONY OF CAPE TOWN ON THIS SITE 
BECAUSE OF THE HARBOUR THE NATURAL HARBOUR HERE WAS RATHER POOR 
THE REASON THAT PEOPLE SETTLED HERE WAS BECAUSE OF THE CLOUDS ON THE MOUNTAIN 
THE CLOUDS CONDENSE WATER FALLS IT PERCOLATES DOWN THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN AND THEN REAPPEARS HERE 
ON THE FLAT GROUND AS SPRINGS WHICH MEANT THAT THEY HAD A CONSTANT SOURCE OF IRRIGATION 
AND THAT'S WHY THEY SETTLED HERE 
THE CAPE HAS A MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE 
WHICH IS WET IN WINTER BUT BONE DRY AND HOT IN SUMMER 
SO HAVING A CONSTANT WATER SUPPLY WAS VITAL TO THE GARDEN'S SUCCESS 
THIS IS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL SPRINGS 
THAT WAS USED FOR THE GARDEN AND OF COURSE THE WATER WHICH HAS COME 
DOWN FROM THE TOP OF TABLE MOUNTAIN FILTERED DOWN AND IS STILL RUNNING 
ALTHOUGH IN ITS HEYDAY THIS WAS FIVE AND A HALF HECTARES 
OF VERY ORGANISED RECTILINEAR DUTCH VEGETABLE GROWING 
IT SOON PROVED TO BE NOT ADEQUATE FOR THE NEEDS OF BOTH THE COLONY 
AND ALSO THE SHIPS THAT KEPT COMING IN 
SO COMPANY EMPLOYEES WERE GIVEN PERMISSION TO SET UP FARMS 
WHICH COULD SUPPLEMENT THE ORIGINAL COMPANY GARDEN PRODUCE 
IN THE GARDEN THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WERE GRADUALLY REPLACED 
BY ORNAMENTAL PLANTS BY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY IT WAS A FULL BLOWN PLEASURE GARDEN 
BUT THE GARDEN REMAINS THE HEART OF CAPE TOWN AND THE BIRTH OF MODERN COLONISED SOUTH AFRICA 
WHEREAS THE COMPANY GARDEN WAS VERY MUCH A CORPORATE PLACE WITH PRACTICAL BEGINNINGS 
THAT BECAME A PLEASURE GARDEN I'VE COME HERE TO STELLENBERG WHICH IS A PRIVATE HOUSE 
IT'S THE OLDEST PRIVATELY OWNED HOUSE IN THE WHOLE OF SOUTH AFRICA 
WHICH I'VE HEARD IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL GARDEN 
BUT PERHAPS MORE INTERESTINGLY ALSO SHOULD TELL ME SOMETHING OF SOUTH AFRICA'S COLONIAL HISTORY 
STELLENBERG WAS PART OF THE CULTURAL MIX THAT COLONISED THE CAPE FROM THE OUTSET 
IT WAS BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY TWO BY AN ENGLISHMAN CALLED JOHN WHITE 
WHO THEN CHANGED HIS NAME TO JAN DE WITT 
AND BUILT IT IN A DUTCH COLONIAL STYLE 
THE FIVE ACRE GARDEN IS SET AROUND THE HOUSE 
AND HAS A DISTINCTLY EUROPEAN FEEL IT IS GRAND ELEGANT AND CHARMING 
UNFORTUNATELY THE WEATHER TURNED ONLY TOO EUROPEAN AS WELL 
OH IT'S TYPICAL I COME TO SOUTH AFRICA IN ITS SUMMER 
AND IT'S PELTING WITH RAIN REALLY REALLY WET 
BUT I'M ENGLISH AND I WON'T LET A LITTLE RAIN COME BETWEEN 
ME AND A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN WHICH EVEN IN THE WET IT CLEARLY IS 
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS 
IS THAT IT'S A WHITE GARDEN 
WITH THIS WHITE PARTERRE AND A WHITE HOUSE 
A HOUSE WHICH IS VERY DUTCH NOT AT ALL ENGLISH 
NOW THEY CALL THIS A WHITE GARDEN AND ALL THE PLANTS ARE SHADES OF WHITE 
BUT IN FACT IT'S A GREEN GARDEN AND I THINK THAT'S TRUE OF ALL SO CALLED WHITE GARDENS 
BECAUSE THE WHITE MAKES THE GREEN SEEM GREENER 
AND THE FACT THAT IT'S SO WET TODAY MAKES THE WHOLE THING SHINE WITH THAT EXTRAORDINARY GREEN INTENSITY 
WELL IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO SEE A VEGETABLE GARDEN 
AND THIS IS A VERY CAREFULLY MANNERED TASTEFUL AFFAIR 
YOU FEEL THAT 
THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO SURVIVE OFF THESE VEG 
THEY'RE GROWING FOR AS MUCH THE WAY THEY LOOK AS THEY ARE BUT IT'S LOVELY 
I'M NOT LETTING THE RAIN DAMPEN MY SPIRITS AND IN FACT THERE ARE VERY NICE TOUCHES 
FOR INSTANCE THESE STEPS VERY VERY SHALLOW STEPS ALMOST A SLOPE 
IT LOOKS WONDERFUL IT'S GOT REAL STYLE 
AND AS I GO ROUND THE WORLD I ALWAYS SEE LITTLE BITS AND PIECES AND I THINK I'LL NICK THAT 
I'LL USE THAT FOR MY OWN GARDEN AND THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS 
SEE THAT'S INTERESTING YOU'VE GOT THE MELIANTHUS WHICH TO ME IS EXOTIC AND BEAUTIFUL 
AND A VERY SOUTH AFRICAN PLANT AND THEN THE CANNA BEHIND IT 
AND A FANTASTIC BRUNSVIGIA I MEAN LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE FANTASTIC 
HUGE FLOWERING TRUMPETS 
WITH DELPHINIUMS AND ROSES 
AND VERBENA BONARIENSIS AND MULLEINS AND FOXGLOVES 
ALL THE ELEMENTS 
OF A LOVELY ENGLISH MIXED BORDER 
ALL THE TRICKS OF THE HORTICULTURAL DESIGN TRADE ARE BEING WHEELED OUT 
PARTERRES WITH SANTOLINA AND LAVENDER 
THE LUCHENS SEAT PAINTED A TASTEFUL COLOUR 
YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE BUT THE TRUTH IS THE REASON WHY YOU'VE SEEN IT BEFORE IS BECAUSE IT IS LOVELY 
STELLENBERG IS A GARDEN MADE WITH GREAT CARE AND LOVE 
AND THE DUTCH HOUSE AND ENGLISH GARDEN 
MEASURE OUT A COLONIAL PAST WITH GREAT ELEGANCE AND STYLE 
ITS HERITAGE IS COLONIAL BUT DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE CULTURE OF NORTHERN EUROPE 
HOWEVER HAVING SEEN THIS 
I NOW THINK I NEED TO SORT OF ESCAPE ALL THOSE ENGLISH INFLUENCES 
AND JUST FIND SOMETHING THAT IS NEAT SOUTH AFRICA UNDILUTED 
SO I'M HEADING OFF DOWN THE CAPE PENINSULA JUST SOUTH OF THE CITY 
I'VE COME ON DOWN THE CAPE AND THE RAIN HAS CLEARED THANK GOODNESS 
I'VE STOPPED JUST TO TAKE AN OVERVIEW BECAUSE FROM HERE 
I CAN LOOK BACK AND SEE TABLE MOUNTAIN 
WITH ITS TABLECLOTH OF CLOUD STILL ON IT KIRSTENBOSCH ON THE SLOPES 
AND STELLENBERG WHERE I'VE JUST COME FROM TUCKED IN DOWN BELOW THAT WITH CLOUD STILL ROUND IT 
PROBABLY STILL RAINING THERE 
BUT UP HERE IT'S WINDY BUT FOR THE MOMENT IT'S DRY 
TABLE MOUNTAIN IS AT THE HEAD OF A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS 
WHICH RUN DOWN THE CAPE PENINSULA TO THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE 
WHICH IS THE SYMBOLIC SOUTHERN TIP OF AFRICA 
IT WAS ORIGINALLY KNOWN AS THE CAPE OF STORMS AND IS STILL A TRICKY 
PIECE OF WATER WHOSE ROCKY COAST IS LITTERED WITH SHIPWRECKS 
THIS IS THE SETTING FOR MY LAST CAPE GARDEN 
CREATED BY DONOVAN VAN DER HEYDEN AND CALLED LI'L EDEN 
DONOVAN'S HOUSE AND GARDEN IS PART OF AN UNOFFICIAL SHANTY TOWN 
OF WOODEN AND TIN HUTS THROWN UP CHEEK BY JOWL 
ABOVE THE FISHING PORT OF HOUT BAY 
HIS GARDEN IS A SERIES OF TERRACES ON THE HILLSIDE 
LOOKING OUT OVER THE BLUE WATERS OF THE BAY 
WHAT WAS YOUR OWN INSPIRATION TO GET IT GOING 
FROM THE MOUNTAINS I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ROAMING THE MOUNTAINS GOING THROUGH THE WATER STREAMS 
YOU KNOW STUDYING THE FIXTURES AND 
YOU KNOW THE FORMS OF THE PLANTS AND HOW THEY COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER THEIR RELATIONSHIP 
WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS VERY SOPHISTICATED 
UNDERSTANDING OF NATURE AND HOW IT WORKS 
I TAKE IT FROM THE PEOPLE THAT WE AS A LOCAL PEOPLE HERE DESCEND FROM 
THEY LIVED CLOSE TO NATURE YOU KNOW 
THEY ADDED HARMONY WITH NATURE AND TO ME IT'S REALLY 
THAT IS MY INSPIRATION AND MAINTAINING THAT 
IN TERMS OF THIS GARDEN HERE 
IS IT CONSTANTLY EVOLVING OR HAS IT REACHED A POINT AT WHICH 
YOU'RE HAPPY WITH IT AND IT'S STAYING NO 
I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER BE SATISFIED 
IN TERMS OF MY GARDEN I SEE MYSELF AS AN ARTIST 
WITH AN ARTIST THERE'S ALWAYS NEW SCENERY SOMETHING NEW THAT INSPIRES 
HIM THAT HE WANTS TO CAPTURE ON CANVAS 
AND SIMILARLY WITH ME WHEN I WALK AROUND IN NATURE THERE'S ALWAYS 
SOMETHING CAPTIVATING THERE THAT I SEE AND IT'S LIKE WOW 
YOU KNOW I MUST AND THEN I COME TO MY GARDEN AND I EXPERIMENT AND I PLAY AROUND WITH THE ROCKS 
YOU KNOW AND SIMILARLY AS AN ARTIST WITH TEXTURES COLOURS YOU KNOW 
SO YEAH 
IT'S ALWAYS CHANGING WHAT DO YOUR NEIGHBOURS THINK 
THEY HAVEN'T ALL GOT GARDENS WHAT DO THEY THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DO 
IT'S AN INFORMAL SETTLEMENT A SQUATTER CAMP 
AND ANY AVAILABLE OPEN SPACE IS UTILISED 
TO PUT UP ANOTHER BUNGALOW FOR SOMEONE TO LIVE IN YOU KNOW 
SO WHEN YOU TAKE SPACE AND MAKE A GARDEN YOU KNOW YOU GET CHALLENGED 
AND THIS WAS MET IN THE SAME WAY 
BUT THE COMMUNITY DOES BENEFIT DIRECTLY FROM DONOVAN'S GARDEN 
HE'S RUNNING A PROJECT TO INTRODUCE LOCAL CHILDREN 
TO THE VALUE AND PLEASURES OF GARDENING AND GROWING PLANTS 
THE PARALLEL BASICALLY THAT IF YOU PLANT A SEED 
AND YOU WATER THEN YOU NURTURE IT AND YOU SEE IT GROWING AND MATURING INTO A WELL ESTABLISHED TREE 
YOU PICK THE FRUITS OF IT AND AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU CAN ENJOY THE FRUITS 
THE SAME WAY THE ELDERS KNEW THAT IF THEY PLANTED THE SEEDS IN US 
AS YOUNG PEOPLE BACK THEN THE FRUITS WOULD ULTIMATELY BE REAPED WHEN WE ARE GROWN 
WE WOULD BE TAKING ON THAT KIND OF WORK 
WE'VE GOT AN INTEREST AS HUMANS TO PROTECT WHAT WE HAVE 
DONOVAN AND HIS VISION OF A SOCIETY LITERALLY GROWING OUT OF THE SOIL 
AND THE PLANTS OF THE CAPE SEEM TO ME TO MAKE HIS TINY GARDEN 
ON THE SHANTY HILLSIDE TRULY BEAUTIFUL 
BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO LEAVE THE CAPE AND BEFORE I VISIT MY NEXT GARDEN 
I WANT TO SEE SOME MORE OF THAT SPECTACULAR SOUTH AFRICAN LANDSCAPE 
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE MYSELF OFF INLAND TO THE DRAKENSBERG MOUNTAINS 
IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE MOST OF THE PLANTS 
THAT I RECOGNISE AS BEING SOUTH AFRICAN IN MY OWN GARDEN COME FROM 
THIS MEANS THAT I AM NOW TRAVELLING EAST TO THE DRAKENSBURG 
OR DRAGON'S MOUNTAINS 
IT'S A CURIOUS THING THAT SO MANY OF THE PLANTS OF THIS REGION 
WHICH ARE SO DIFFERENT AND SO FAR FROM HOME 
HAVE ADAPTED SO WELL TO OUR OWN GARDENS 
AND YOU ALSO HAVE THE TRULY EXOTIC GROWING HERE ALMOST CARELESSLY 
CAN YOU JUST STOP HERE A SEC 
LOOK AT THAT 
HERE JUST BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
YOU'VE GOT ARUM LILIES GROWING LIKE A WEED 
THIS IS A WET BIT ON THE MARGINS 
AND HERE IT IS LOOK AT THAT 
PEOPLE IN LONDON WILL GO AND PAY A FORTUNE FOR A BUNCH OF THOSE 
THAT IS I THINK 
ZANTEDESCHIA ALBOMACULATA 
AND IT IS JUST BEAUTIFUL 
JUST GROWING BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
THESE MOUNTAINS RISE UP TO ABOUT THREE THOUSAND METRES 
WHICH IS ABOUT TWICE AS HIGH AS BEN NEVIS 
I ABSOLUTELY HADN'T EXPECTED THIS 
A SORT OF ALPINE MEADOW 
FILLED WITH FLOWERS 
THIS IS A CANDELABRA LILY 
AND THIS WHOPPING GREAT FLOWERHEAD 
AND THEN NEXT TO IT THERE'S A LITTLE ASTER THERE AND A WHITE SCILLA THERE 
THE DRAKENSBERG RANGE IS ON THE EAST SIDE OF SOUTH AFRICA 
AND HAS THE OPPOSITE CLIMATE TO THAT OF THE CAPE 
SO HERE THE RAINS FALL DURING THE WARM WET SUMMERS WHICH 
GIVES THE PLANTS A GROWING SEASON SIMILAR TO THAT OF NORTHERN EUROPE 
THIS PURPLE FLOWER HERE IS I'M SURE VERNONIA 
NOW I PLANTED THIS AT BERRYFIELDS JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO 
AND HERE IT IS GROWING IN ITS TRUE HOME 
IN THE DRAKENSBERG MOUNTAINS 
THIS IS A FUNNY ONE THIS IS PHYGELIUS AEQUALIS WHICH IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMMON NOW 
YOU SEE IT IN LOTS OF GARDENS AND GARDEN CENTRES AND HERE'S WHERE IT REALLY WANTS TO BE 
I'M HEADING BACK BECAUSE IT'S GONE FROM BEING BEAUTIFULLY CLEAR AND HOT 
TO REALLY WET AND THERE'S RUMBLES OF THUNDER 
AND APPARENTLY THE LAST THING YOU SHOULD DO IS THERE WE ARE 
HANG ABOUT IF THERE'S ANY LIGHTNING IN THE MOUNTAINS COS IT GETS YOU 
OOH LOOK LOOK AT THAT 
COME IN HERE AND HAVE A LOOK 
THAT LITTLE WHITE FLOWER IS A STREPTOCARPUS 
IN FLOWER GROWING ON AN ALMOST VERTICAL DAMP BANK 
THE STORMS TEND TO BE LIMITED TO THE AFTERNOONS 
AND THE NEXT MORNING I GET UP EARLY TO GO FURTHER UP IN THE MOUNTAINS 
ONCE YOU GET HIGHER UP AND I'M NOW AT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRES 
THE LANDSCAPE FORMS ITSELF 
INTO THE KIND OF THING THAT PEOPLE VERY CAREFULLY CONSTRUCT IN ROCK GARDENS 
AND HERE YOU CAN SEE LITTLE HELICHRYSUMS JUST 
IN LITTLE NICHES AND PERCHES IN THE ROCKS WHICH ARE FORMED BEAUTIFULLY 
YOU COULDN'T DO THIS BETTER WITH ALL THE MONEY AND SKILL THAT BRITISH HORTICULTURE COULD GIVE YOU 
THE GROUND HERE IS DAPPLED 
WITH THESE LOVELY LITTLE PINK AND WHITE FLOWERS 
IT'S RHODOHYPOXIS 
AND IT'S A TINY LITTLE THING I'VE NEVER GROWN IT 
BUT YOU CAN GROW IT IN THE U. K. BUT NORMALLY AS A PAN IN A CONTAINER 
AND HERE THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM SPRINKLED OVER THE GROUND 
I'M WALKING THROUGH 
WHAT REALLY AMOUNTS TO A FIELD OF EUCOMIS 
YOU CAN SEE THEM HERE WITH THE FLOWERS BEGINNING TO FORM AND THE LITTLE PINEAPPLE TOPKNOT 
NOW THESE COST A FORTUNE IN THE U. K. BUT HERE THEY ARE 
NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND FEET UP ON THE SIDE OF A FREEZING COLD MOUNTAIN 
NOW LOOK AT THIS LITTLE CLUMP OF LOBELIA 
HERE EIGHT THOUSAND FEET UP GROWING CHEEK BY JOWL WITH THE EUCOMIS 
THE DRAKENSBERG REALLY IS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY VAST BEAUTIFUL SIGHT 
BUT ON A DAY LIKE TODAY IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT IN WINTER 
IT QUITE REGULARLY GETS DOWN TO ABOUT MINUS TWO OR THREE HERE 
AND ON THE COLDER PARTS HIGHER UP 
DOWN TO MINUS TWENTY OR EVEN COLDER AND SNOW IS REALLY COMMON 
WHICH MEANS THAT ESSENTIALLY IT'S ALPINE AND THIS OF COURSE 
IS THE REASON WHY THE PLANTS FROM THIS AREA 
ADAPT SO WELL TO OUR GARDENS IN NORTHERN EUROPE 
AND THAT'S THE CONNECTION 
SEEING PLANTS IN THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT IS THE BEST WAY TO LEARN ABOUT THEM 
AND I'LL NEVER LOOK AGAIN ON A HANGING BASKET FILLED WITH LOBELIA WITHOUT THINKING OF THE DRAKENSBERG 
THE DRAKENSBERG IS A GIANT ESCARPMENT 
AT ITS BACK IS AN ARID PLATEAU 
THE HIGH VELDT WHICH HAS YET ANOTHER DISTINCT ZONE OF LIFE 
THIS IS THE SETTING FOR AN UNLIKELY GARDEN BUILT HERE NEARLY EIGHTY YEARS 
AGO BY THE MAGNIFICENTLY NAMED TUDOR BODDHAM WHETHAM AND HIS WIFE RUBY 
NAMED KIRKLINGTON AFTER THE NOTTINGHAM VILLAGE WHERE TUDOR WAS BORN 
THE REMOTE HOUSE LOOKS OVER THE DISTANT SAVANNAH 
AND IS MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE GARDEN IN THE VELDT 
THE GARDEN IS CUT INTO THE HILLSIDE IN A SERIES OF TERRACES 
ALTHOUGH ONLY THE AREA AROUND THE HOUSE REMAINS TENDED TODAY 
BUT THERE STILL REMAIN HINTS AND SIGNS OF SOMETHING MUCH GRANDER 
THICK STONE PATHS AND WALLS ARE STILL THERE AMONGST THE ROUGH GROWTH 
AND BENEATH THE OVERGROWN GRASS OF THE ORCHARD 
LIES A SLEEPING GIANT OF A GARDEN 
THESE STEPS LEAD DOWN 
WAY OUT OF THE GARDEN AND THESE ARE REALLY SOLID 
PAVING STONES AND STEPS 
YOU SEE THEY GO ON AND ON AND RIGHT DOWN 
AND THESE STEPS COME DOWN TO THIS GRAND SWEEPING STAIRCASE 
THIS WAS CLEARLY A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO MAKE A GRANDIOSE 
ENGLISH COUNTRY HOUSE GARDEN CARVED OUT OF THE HIGH VELDT STONE 
THIS IS GARDEN MAKING ON THE MOST AMBITIOUS OF SCALES IN THE MOST IMPROBABLE OF CIRCUMSTANCES 
TUDOR'S DESCENDANTS THE MOFFETT FAMILY STILL LIVE ON THE FARM AND TOLD ME ABOUT ITS CREATION 
THEY HAD TO DRESS ALL THE STONE CUT IT ON THE FARM HAUL IT IN 
AND THEN START LAYING OUT THE PATHS AND THE 
TERRACES AND BUILDING THE WALLS 
THIS IS REALLY AMBITIOUS STUFF YOU'RE DESCRIBING 
VERY VERY AMBITIOUS YES 
CLIMATE WISE IT WAS A BATTLE 
WE ARE PRETTY EXTREME HERE BEING SO HIGH 
JANUARY FEBRUARY WHEN THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF RAIN 
THE GARDEN REALLY SUFFERS 
AT TIMES WE BRING IN TANKERS CART UP WATER ON AN ON GOING BASIS 
TO KEEP THOSE FEW THINGS GOING WHICH ARE MORE IMPORTANT 
THE CROPS GET IT FIRST THE FARM CROPS AND THEN OR THE CATTLE 
THE RAIN COMES AND THEN YOU WON'T HAVE RAIN FOR A LONG TIME AGAIN 
AND IT STREAMS OFF THE MOUNTAIN 
GATHERING AND STORING WATER IS THE KEY TO THE GARDEN'S EXISTENCE 
EVEN BEFORE HE BEGAN THE GARDEN TUDOR MADE EXTRAORDINARY AND EXTREME 
MEASURES TO TRAP THE STORM WATER AS IT TUMBLED DOWN THE CLIFFS 
THIS PATH BEHIND THE HOUSE IS ESSENTIALLY A DRAIN A STONE DRAIN 
THAT COMES DOWN GOES UNDERNEATH THIS BUILDING OUT THIS PIPE 
AND THEN ALONG THIS PATH 
WHICH MEETS IN THE MIDDLE THE WATER WHICH POURS OFF THE HILLSIDE 
IT COMES DOWN HERE 
AND COMES TO THIS POINT 
WATER POURING IN DOWN THERE THROUGH A DRAIN THERE 
THROUGH THIS SYSTEM INTO THIS ENORMOUS TANK 
WHICH WAS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO WATER THE GARDEN 
SO TUDOR'S PLANS WERE FROM THE OUTSET WILDLY 
CRAZILY GRAND AND WITHOUT THIS KIND OF INGENIOUS HYDRO ENGINEERING 
A GARDEN LIKE THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE HERE 
I CAME UP HERE TO SEE THE WATER CULVERTS CUT INTO THE ROCK 
AND GET AN IDEA OF THIS GREAT CLIFF FACE AND THE WATER POURING DOWN TO THE GARDEN 
BUT NOW I'M UP HERE 
IT'S THE VIEW THAT IS FANTASTIC IT'S AWESOME 
AND IT'S ALL OR A GREAT CHUNK OF IT CONNECTED TO THE HOUSE AND GARDEN 
SO YOU HAVE THE HOUSE AND THE GARDEN BELOW AND THEN THE FIELDS 
STRETCHING RIGHT OUT FOR A GREAT CHUNK OF WHAT YOU CAN SEE 
AND FOR MOST OF US 
TO LIVE IN SCENERY OF THIS SCALE IS UNIMAGINABLE 
SO NOW I ENTER INTO THE FINAL LEG OF MY JOURNEY HEADING ACROSS THE HIGH PLAINS TO JOHANNESBURG 
BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE DETOUR FIRST 
TO VISIT ANOTHER GARDEN 
THIS IS ONE THAT I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT 
BUT WHAT I'VE HEARD WHETS MY APPETITE 
IT'S GROWN ORGANICALLY IN SO MUCH THAT IT WASN'T REALLY PLANNED I KNOW THAT IT'S JUST SORT OF ACCRUED 
IT MAINLY USES SUCCULENTS FROM THE REGION 
AND ALSO A LOT OF ROCKS AND STONES 
UNLIKE MY LAST VISIT THIS IS NOT A GARDEN THAT TRIES TO FIGHT THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT 
BUT INSTEAD EMBRACES IT AND IN THAT IT IS TRULY OF THE PLACE 
A WHOLLY SOUTH AFRICAN GARDEN 
EVERYTHING HERE INCLUDING THE HOUSE AND ITS FURNITURE HAS BEEN DESIGNED AND MADE BY THE OWNERS 
I ASKED THEM WHAT IT WAS CALLED 
IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A NAME THEY SAID SO LET'S CALL IT THE MAGALIESBERG ROCK GARDEN 
WHAT I'M 
ABSOLUTELY LOVING 
IS THE WAY THAT 
STONE 
WOOD AND PLANT MATERIAL 
ARE MERGING AND BECOMING COMPLETELY FUSED AS AN EXPRESSION 
AND THIS IS DELIBERATE 
THE GARDEN MADE BY A PAINTER AND A SCULPTOR 
IS BEING CREATED AS A WORK OF LAND ART 
SEE LOOK UP THERE LOOK AT THAT 
THAT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL 
I HAVE TO SAY THAT WHEN WE FIRST CAME HERE 
I KNEW THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE QUITE INTERESTING AND I'D SEEN AN ODD PICTURE OR TWO BUT I HAD NO IDEA 
THAT IT WAS ALL DONE ON THIS SCALE 
THE NATURAL SLOPE OF THE HILLSIDE HAS BEEN GAUGED AND HOLLOWED INTO ONE VAST SCULPTURE 
SO RAVINES HILLOCKS AND ROCKY PASSES LEADING NOWHERE 
MAP OUT THIS NEW MADE UP LAND 
AND BOWLS PONDS AND WOODEN BONY CARCASSES JOSTLE THE STONE 
UNTIL THEY MARRY INTO A KIND OF COMPOSITE ORGANIC MATERIAL 
IT'S BREATHTAKING 
FANTASTIC THE HEALTH AND SAFETY PEOPLE WOULD BE HAVING A FIT NOW 
AND IF I FALL OFF WELL AT LEAST I'VE HAD FUN 
I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT AND I SUSPECT OFTEN SAID THAT 
HALF OF GARDENING IS JUST GROWN UPS GOING OUTSIDE TO PLAY 
AND WHAT I FEEL HERE IS THAT THIS IS JUST UNTRAMMELLED PLAY 
SOMEONE WHO'S RAISED PLAYING OUTSIDE IN THE GARDEN TO AN ART FORM 
EVEN THOUGH THE STONEWORK AND THE SCULPTURE SEEMS TO DOMINATE 
AND I THINK IF IT WAS JUST STONEWORK AND WOOD 
IT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL AND INTERESTING BUT IT WOULDN'T QUITE BE ENOUGH 
WHAT REALLY MAKES IT COME ALIVE AND WHAT PEOPLES IT ARE THE PLANTS 
THERE ARE A WIDE RANGE OF DROUGHT TOLERANT PLANTS GRASSES AGAVES AND MANY OTHER INDIGENOUS SOUTH 
AFRICAN SUCCULENTS MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN RESCUED FROM DEVELOPMENT AND BOUGHT HERE TO BE NURTURED 
BUT IT IS THE GIANT ALOES THAT DOMINATE 
SOME OF THE BIGGER ONES ARE JUST BURSTING WITH PERSONALITY 
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU OUGHT TO GO UP AND INTRODUCE YOURSELF 
ALL OF THESE PLANTS ARE PERFECTLY ADAPTED TO THE ARID CONDITIONS HERE 
AS IS THE INEVITABLE WILDLIFE THEY ATTRACT 
THERE'S EVEN A WEAVER BIRD COLONY JUST OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR 
THE GARDEN DOWN TO THE LAST STONE IS THE CREATION OF THE SCULPTOR 
GEOFFREY ARMSTRONG AND PAINTER WENDY VINCENT 
IT'S A HAPPY HOUR GARDEN THAT'S HOW IT STARTED 
AFTER YOU HAD SPENT THE DAY PAINTING OR CARVING YOU'D THEN COME AND SIT 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SAID RIGHT LET'S HAVE A STREAM 
LET'S HAVE A POND WE ALL DO IT AND EXACTLY 
YOU HAVE A CUP OF TEA IN THE MORNING AND YOU SAY LET'S HAVE A STREAM YES 
WE'RE ALREADY LAYING ANOTHER POND EVEN THOUGH THE WATER'S DRYING UP 
I LIKE YOUR STYLE 
AND THAT BECAME OBSESSIVE AND THEN STARTED TO 
ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO ONE STARTED TO THINK OF IT AS A WORK OF ART 
YES IT'S QUITE COMMON TO SEE WORKS OF ART IN A GARDEN 
IT'S QUITE COMMON FOR ARTISTS 
TO HAVE A KEEN INTEREST IN GARDENS AS AN EXPRESSION OF THEIR ART 
IT'S NOT VERY COMMON TO SEE GARDENS AS A WORK OF ART 
WAS IT INTENDED AS THAT IT CHANGED 
WE WERE JUST ENTHUSIASTS YOU KNOW BRINGING PLANTS AND ROCKS IN 
AND THEN WE STARTED LOOKING AT THE WHOLE AND THAT WAS THEN 
WHEN WE SAW THAT IT WAS GETTING MORE IMPORTANT THAN JUST THAT 
IT WAS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT TO BRING IN THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND TO SEE THROUGH AND TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT ASPECTS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES AND TO SEE THAT YOU NEEDED 
TO REPEAT SOMETHING SOMEWHERE ELSE AND WHERE YOU WOULD CLUSTER THINGS 
JUST LIKE PAINTING A CANVAS ACTUALLY 
NOW BRITISH HORTICULTURE CAN BE OCCASIONALLY A BIT 
POMPOUS AND SELF REFERENTIAL BUT A GARDEN LIKE THIS 
ENTIRELY IN TUNE WITH ITS SETTING THAT CELEBRATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PLANTS AND ART 
AND YET MAYBE THE SORT OF EARTH MANIA THAT EVERY GARDENER RECOGNISES 
REKINDLES EVERY KIND OF ENTHUSIASM 
SO I CONTINUE ON TO JOHANNESBURG BUOYED UP WITH INSPIRATION 
I'M ON MY WAY TO A GARDEN NOW CALLED BRENTHURST 
WHICH IS RECKONED TO BE THE BIGGEST AND THE GRANDEST AND THE BEST KNOWN GARDEN IN THE WHOLE OF SOUTH AFRICA 
IT'S RUN BY A WOMAN CALLED STRILLI OPPENHEIMER WHO SINCE SHE TOOK 
IT OVER ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO HAS TURNED IT COMPLETELY ORGANIC 
SO ON TWO COUNTS THIS IS LIKELY TO BE A REALLY INTERESTING GARDEN FOR ME 
BRENTHURST IS CERTAINLY GRAND FOR A START IT IS HUGE 
FORTY FIVE ACRES OF INTENSIVE GARDENS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF JOHANNESBURG 
IT HAS BELONGED TO THE OPPENHEIMER FAMILY SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN TWENTIES WHOSE 
FORTUNE WAS DERIVED FROM THE LOCAL DIAMOND AND GOLD MINING INDUSTRIES 
THE GARDEN HAS MANY DIFFERENT SECTIONS INCLUDING SWEEPING LAWNS STATUARY A LARGE JAPANESE GARDEN 
MATURE WOODLANDS A BIODYNAMIC VEGETABLE GARDEN AND AREAS THAT SEEM TO BE LEFT TO GROW WILD 
OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS THE GARDEN HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH A KIND OF HORTICULTURAL REVOLUTION 
WHICH HAS SHOCKED SOME BUT THRILLED AS MANY OTHERS 
AND THIS IS ENTIRELY DUE TO THE NATURALISTIC PRINCIPLES 
OF ITS CURRENT MISTRESS STRILLI OPPENHEIMER 
I COULD QUITE EASILY AND FIND IT EXCITING 
TO DO NOTHING AT ALL WITH THE GARDEN AND JUST WATCH IT 
BECOME TOTALLY WILD AGAIN 
AND MEET ITS CLIMAX AND CREATE ANOTHER RHYTHM 
THE GARDEN WAS ORIGINALLY LAID OUT IN NINETEEN OH FOUR BUT MUCH OF THE EXISTING 
STRUCTURE WAS ADDED IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE BY THE GARDEN DESIGNER JOAN PIMM 
HOWEVER IT REMAINED AS A CONVENTIONAL HIGHLY CONTROLLED 
EDWARDIAN GARDEN UNTIL STRILLI TOOK OVER IN TWO THOUSAND ONE 
NOW THE LAWNS CONSIST OF LOCAL SPECIES OF GRASS 
WHOLE SWATHES OF WHICH ARE ENCOURAGED TO RUN TO SEED 
AND BORDERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO GROW NATURALLY WITHOUT OBVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO TIDY OR CONTROL 
HOWEVER THE VISTAS AND VIEWS ARE CAREFULLY MAINTAINED 
I THINK THAT THE SCALE IS SUPERB 
ON THE HILLSIDE ABOVE THE STATUES IS A HUGE JAPANESE GARDEN COMMISSIONED BY STRILLI AND HER HUSBAND NICKY 
THIS WAS DONE BY ONE OF THE GARDENERS OF THE EMPEROR 
AND SO FOR ME 
I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT JAPANESE GARDENS BUT NOT A LOT 
AND WHAT I NEEDED WAS THAT IF WE HAD SOMETHING WHICH WAS CALLED 
A JAPANESE GARDEN THAT IT WAS TRULY AUTHENTIC TO THE JAPANESE 
AND FOR ME WHAT IT DOES IS CREATE A TENSION BETWEEN THE SORT OF GARDENING 
WHERE I AM COMFORTABLE WHICH IS VERY NATURAL AND DON'T PRUNE ANYTHING 
AND THIS TOTALLY CLIPPED GARDEN 
CERTAINLY THE ALMOST OBSESSIVE CONTROL OF JAPANESE HORTICULTURE 
IN THIS GARDEN CREATES A DYNAMIC OF BALANCING TENSIONS AND IDEOLOGIES 
IT GIVES THE PLACE ENERGY 
ROUND THE CORNER WE GO UP TO THE KOPJE GARDEN 
NOW KOPJE IS AN AFRICAN ROCKY OUTCROP AND HERE THE PLANTS ARE AGAIN GIVEN A FREE REIN 
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GARDEN NATURALLY ARE BECOMING 
ENVIRONMENTALLY MUCH MORE AWARE WHO WANT TO BE IN TUNE WITH WHAT THEY 
CONCEIVE AS A CORRECT WAY TO BEHAVE TOWARDS THE NATURAL WORLD 
HAVE ONLY THEIR GARDEN IN WHICH TO OPERATE 
BUT I THINK THEY MUST BE CONSCIOUS ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT 
AND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO AND HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP 
WHEN THEY HAVE A REAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PLANTS THEN THEY'RE 
I MEAN IT'S LIKE WITH THEIR CHILDREN THEY LET THEIR CHILDREN GROW 
THEY DON'T TOTALLY PRUNE AND OR MAYBE SOME PEOPLE DO 
YOU KNOW CONTROL THEIR CHILDREN AND THEN THEY'RE A DISASTER 
BRENTHURST IS A CAREFULLY MANAGED BALANCE BETWEEN NATURAL FREEDOM AND HUMAN CONTROL 
CLIPPED HEDGES CONTAIN UNTRAMMELLED GROWTH AND EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED 
AND INTERWOVEN BY PATHS MANY OF WHICH ARE DECORATED 
WITH ASSAY CORES FROM THE MINES 
STRILLI TAKES ME TO THE TERRACE JUST BELOW THE HOUSE TO SHOW ME THE BROAD 
VIEW BUT IN PARTICULAR THE LARGE BORDERS ON THE LAWN BELOW 
THESE WERE PLANNED AND PLANTED AND THEN LEFT TO GROW PRETTY MUCH 
AS THEY PLEASED CREATING A CONSTANTLY EVOLVING DISPLAY 
THIS IS TYPICAL 
OF ALLOWING REALLY NATURE TO DO WHAT IT WANTS TO DO 
AND NOT IMPOSING ONE'S OWN VIEW ON IT AND IT'S JUST AS BEAUTIFUL 
IF NOT MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN IT WAS AS A MIXED BORDER 
WE IN THE U. K. MAKE THESE BORDERS 
WE PLANT THEM CAREFULLY WE PLAN AND DESIGN THEM 
WE TWEAK AND PRUNE AND PREEN THEM AND TRY AND ESTABLISH A PICTURE 
LIKE A WORK OF ART AND SOMEHOW TAKE THE APPLAUSE FOR IT OURSELVES 
WHEREAS WHAT STRILLI SAID ABOUT THESE MIXED BORDERS MADE A HUGE IMPRESSION ON ME 
LET THE PLANTS DO THEIR OWN THING 
LET THEM FREE THEY'LL DO IT FINE WITHOUT YOU 
NOW THAT'S SO INSPIRATIONAL 
AND IMMEDIATELY I THOUGHT I LIKE THAT A LOT AND I WANT TO DO IT 
I WANT TO GET OUT IN MY OWN GARDEN AND DO PRECISELY THAT 
THE EFFECT OF BRENTHURST JUST LIKE THE ROCK GARDEN AT MAGALIESBERG IS TO SHAKE UP MY IDEA OF HOW 
TO GARDEN AND REDEFINE MY IMAGE OF WHAT A GARDEN CAN BE AND NOT TO BE OVERAWED BY THAT BUT EMPOWERED 
BEFORE I LEAVE SOUTH AFRICA I HAVE ONE LAST GARDEN TO VISIT 
THAT TAKES ME FROM ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST WHITE HOUSEHOLDS 
TO A SCHOOL IN THE TOWNSHIP OF TEMBISA ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF JOHANNESBURG 
UNDER APARTHEID MILLIONS OF BLACK AFRICANS WERE REMOVED FROM THEIR HOMES AND RE HOUSED IN WHAT WERE 
OFTEN MAKESHIFT SETTLEMENTS CALLED TOWNSHIPS WHICH WERE OFTEN THE FOCUS OF VIOLENT CIVIL UNREST 
TODAY A MILLION PEOPLE LIVE HERE IN PRETTY HARSH CONDITIONS 
AND LIFE IS STILL TOUGH 
BUT WHEN I ARRIVE AT THUTHUKA PRIMARY SCHOOL I AM WELCOMED IN SONG 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON NOT AT ALL 
I'M JUST DRIFTING ALONG IN A RIVER OF SINGING CHILDREN 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SINGING ABOUT I HAVEN'T A CLUE WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT IT'S LOVELY 
THE SCHOOL'S GARDEN IS ORGANIC BIODYNAMIC AND GROWS MOSTLY HERBS AND VEGETABLES 
AND MY IRREPRESSIBLE GUIDE IS A TEACHER MR. LUCAS MBEMBELE 
COME NOW AND ENTER IN THE MAIN GATE TO OUR GARDEN FROM OUR CLASSROOM 
SO NOW HERE THIS IS OUR ZENITH THEY ARE WORKING HERE 
THEY'RE TAKING OFF ALL THE DRY 
AND THE YELLOW LEAVES TO PUT ON OUR COMPOST 
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU 
IT'S A WONDERFUL GARDEN THANK YOU 
YOUR BEDS ARE MIXED 
WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF HERBS DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEGETABLES 
THE REASON IS NOT TO BE ABLE TO REPEL THE INSECTS 
AND FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO GIVE EACH PLANT 
IT GIVES FOOD TO THE OTHER ONE AS WELL AS AN IMPORTANT SUPPLY OF VEGETABLES 
THERE ARE MANY TRADITIONAL MEDICINAL PLANTS BEING GROWN HERE TOO 
HERE AT SCHOOL YOU CAN SEE THERE'S NO CHILD WHO'S COUGHING HERE 
THIS IS THE MAIN MEDICINE WE CALLED LINGANA LINGANA 
BOIL THE WATER AND PUT THERE AND MAKE A TEA AND LET THE CHILD DRINK 
IN NO TIME THAT CHILD IS CURED FROM FLU OR FROM COLD 
BUT THERE ARE SOME PLANTS HERE WHICH ARE INTENDED TO HELP WITH A MUCH MORE SERIOUS ISSUE H. I. V. AIDS 
SOUTH AFRICA HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST INCIDENCES OF AIDS AFFECTING OVER 
TWENTY PER CENT OF THE ADULT POPULATION AND UP TO A THIRD OF THESE CHILDREN HERE 
I'VE GOT AFRICAN POTATO HERE 
WE DON'T CURE H. I. V. AIDS BUT WE SUSPEND THAT SPREADING 
OF THAT OPPORTUNIST DISEASES THROUGH THE H. I. V. AIDS 
WE TAKE THE BULBS WE CHOP THEM WE COOK THEM WE LET IT DRAIN 
WE'RE REDUCING THE SPEED HOW IT CAN BE ABLE TO KILL YOU 
A SECTION OF THE GARDEN IS USED AS AN OUTDOOR CLASSROOM 
WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT ALL KINDS OF SUBJECTS FROM MATHS TO HORTICULTURE 
TELL ME DO YOU LIKE WORKING IN THE GARDEN 
YES WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT IT 
WATERING PLANTS PLANTING 
I LIKE SWEEPING 
WHY DO YOU LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE IT CLEANS OUR GARDEN WHAT SORT OF THINGS DO YOU LEARN 
HOW TO PLANT TREES HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT 
DO YOU THINK THE GARDEN IS BEAUTIFUL YES WHY 
WE'VE GOT FLOWERS SPINACH ONIONS CABBAGE 
SO THAT MAKES OUR GARDEN LOOK BEAUTIFUL 
IT CERTAINLY DOES 
IF IT BELONGED TO A KEEN AMATEUR GARDENER AT HOME I WOULD ADMIRE IT HUGELY 
AS IT IS THIS IS A SCHOOL GARDEN IN A TOWNSHIP IN SOUTH AFRICA 
SO IT'S BEAUTIFUL IN ITS OWN RIGHT 
AND IT'S A MIRACLE IT'S JUST WONDERFUL 
IT'S BEEN A FASCINATING JOURNEY THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE GARDENS I'VE SEEN REFLECT THE WAY 
THAT THE NATION IS IN A PROCESS OF TRANSITION 
EVOLVING FROM A SEVERE COLONIAL PAST TO A TRUE SOUTH AFRICAN IDENTITY 
THAT IDENTITY IS SHAPED AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE BY THE LANDSCAPE WHICH IS JUST STAGGERING 
AND THEN THERE ARE THE PLANTS IN THAT LANDSCAPE 
TO SEE SO MANY FAMILIAR GARDEN PLANTS GROWING IN THEIR NATURAL FORM AND HABITAT WAS A TREAT 
BEFORE I CAME HERE I HAD A FIXED IMAGE OF SOUTH AFRICA 
FORGED BY THE HORRORS OF APARTHEID 
THAT HAD I ADMIT BECOME A PRETTY BLINKERED OUTLOOK 
IN FACT I'D GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT IF I WAS REALLY HONEST 
BEFORE I CAME HERE I DIDN'T WANT TO COME AT ALL 
AND NOW THAT I'VE BEEN HERE I AM JUST SO GLAD THAT I DID COME 
TO BE HONEST I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE WITHOUT HER
