WOULD YOU LIKE A STORY 
I HAVE A STORY FOR YOU 
ABOUT A LITTLE BROWN HARE LIKE YOURS 
AND ABOUT HIS DADDY BIG HARE 
BOTH OF THEM LOVE EACH OTHER 
JUST THE SAME AS WE LOVE EACH OTHER 
LITTLE BROWN HARE WAS TIRED 
SO HE GOT ON TO BIG BROWN HARE'S BACK AND HELD ON TO HIS EARS 
BIG BROWN HARE HOPPED ALONG 
WITH LITTLE HARE ON HIS BACK 
AFTER A WHILE LITTLE HARE HAD HAD ENOUGH AND WANTED TO GET OFF 
LET ME DOWN HE ASKED 
BIG HARE PUT LITTLE HARE DOWN 
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT ASKED BIG HARE 
LITTLE HARE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY COME OVER HERE HE ASKED 
HE TOOK A DEEP BREATH I LOVE YOU HE SAID 
YOU LOVE ME SAID BIG HARE HOW MUCH 
STRETCHING HIS LITTLE ARMS WIDE I LOVE YOU THIS MUCH 
SAID LITTLE HARE 
M. M. M. SAID BIG HARE YOU DO LOVE ME 
I LOVE YOU TOO THIS MUCH 
AND HE STRETCHED HIS ARMS WIDE 
LITTLE HARE LOOKED ALONG BIG HARE'S OUTSTRETCHED ARMS AND THOUGHT 
I LOVE YOU WATCH ME 
HE STOOD ON TIPTOES 
AND STRETCHED HIS LITTLE ARMS AS HIGH AS THEY WOULD REACH 
M. M. M. SAID BIG BROWN HARE THAT IS HIGH 
I LOVE YOU JUST AS MUCH WATCH ME 
HE STRETCHED HIS LONG ARMS AS HIGH AS HE COULD REACH 
LITTLE HARE LOOKED UP BIG HARE'S LONG ARMS 
THOUGHTFULLY HE HOPPED ALONG DEEP IN THOUGHT 
ONCE AGAIN HE STOPPED BIG HARE AND SAID I LOVE YOU WATCH ME 
HE BOUNCED AROUND HOPPING AS HIGH AND AS FAR AS HE COULD 
BIG BROWN HARE WATCHED HIM HE DOES LOVE ME A LOT HE THOUGHT 
I LOVE YOU JUST AS MUCH HE TOLD LITTLE HARE WATCH ME 
BESIDE A TALL TREE HE JUMPED AS HIGH AS HE COULD RIGHT UP INTO THE AIR 
LITTLE HARE WATCHED HIM AS HE WENT HIGHER 
SO HIGH THAT HIS EARS TOUCHED THE BRANCHES ABOVE 
HE DOES LOVE ME A LOT THOUGHT LITTLE HARE 
BIG HARE AND LITTLE HARE HOPPED ALONG TOGETHER 
FAR AWAY TOWARD THE HILLS AND THE RIVER 
LITTLE HARE LOOKED UP AT HIS FATHER AND BACK TOWARDS THE RIVER 
HE KNEW WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY 
I LOVE YOU HE TOLD HIS FATHER 
FROM HERE ALL THE WAY TO THE RIVER 
AND THAT'S A LONG WAY 
OH YOU LOVE ME ALL THE WAY FROM HERE TO THE RIVER 
THAT IS A LONG WAY REPLIED BIG HARE 
AND I LOVE YOU ALSO 
ALL THE WAY FROM HERE TO THE RIVER 
AND TO THE HILLS FAR BEYOND THE RIVER 
LITTLE HARE LOOKED INTO THE DISTANCE TO THE RIVER AND FAR BEYOND 
HE REALLY DOES LOVE ME A LOT HE THOUGHT 
BY NOW LITTLE HARE WAS SLEEPY ARE YOU TIRED ASKED BIG HARE 
LET ME CARRY YOU 
AS HE LAY FALLING ASLEEP IN BIG BROWN HARE'S ARMS 
LITTLE HARE LOOKED UP AT THE NIGHT SKY AND SAW THE DISTANT MOON 
HE LOOKED UP AT HIS FATHER 
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH HE SAID 
I LOVE YOU ALL THE WAY FROM HERE TO THE MOON 
I REALLY DO LOVE YOU 
AND WITH THAT HE FELL ASLEEP 
OH HE LOVES ME ALL THE WAY TO THE MOON 
HE REALLY DOES LOVE ME A LOT THOUGHT BIG HARE 
HE GENTLY LAID THE SLEEPING LITTLE HARE DOWN 
AND TUCKED HIM UP WITH LEAVES 
AND I LOVE YOU TOO HE WHISPERED

AND BACK AGAIN
