HELLO THERE VERY CLOSE TO CRUNCH 
TIME IN THE BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE 
ON MATCH OF THE DAY THIS WEEK WE 
HAVE GOT VITAL GAMES AT BOTH ENDS 
OF THE TABLE IT IS ALL TOO SERIOUS 
FOR ANY COURT JESTER IN SO ALAN 
SHEARER AND MARK LAWRENSON JOIN US 
WE START AT BLACKBURN ROVERS 
AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED AND A 
CHANCE FOR THE CHAMPIONS TO TAKE A 
HUGE STEP TOWARDS DEFENDING THEIR 
CROWN CROWN UNITED CAME FROM BEHIND LAST SUNDAY 
TO EFFECTIVELY END ARSENAL'S TITLE 
HOPES HOPES THEIR CLOSEST CHALLENGERS NOW WERE 
CHELSEA MICHAEL ESSIEN'S WIN AT 
EVERTON ON THURSDAY REDUCED THE GAP 
TO TWO BUT VICTORY TODAY AND 
AGAIN NEXT SATURDAY WOULD SEE 
UNITED CROWNED CHAMPIONS BUT EWOOD 
PARK IS NOT A HAPPY HUNTING GROUND 
FOR SIR ALEX THEY HAVE BEATEN 
UNITED FIVE TIMES RECENTLY TWO 
WINS FROM THE TIDAL MANCHESTER 
UNITED WILL BE HOPING MARK HUGHES 
AND HIS BLACKBURN TEAM ARE NOT 
ABOUT TO THRUST A LARGE STICK INTO 
THE SPOKES OF THEIR CHAMPIONSHIP 
CHALLENGE AND OPEN THE DOOR A 
LITTLE WHILE FOR CHELSEA 
THREE POINTS TODAY WOULD GIVE 
UNITED THE CHANCE TO CLAIM THEIR 
SEVENTEENTH CHAMPIONSHIP AT STAMFORD 
BRIDGE NEXT SATURDAY BLACKBURN ARE 
UNCHANGED FOR THIS ONE DESPITE A THREE 
ONE DEFEAT AT LIVERPOOL LAST TIME OUT 
BENTLEY AND MORTEN GAMST PEDERSEN 
HAD HAPPY MEMORIES OF SCORING GOALS 
AGAINST TODAY'S OPPONENTS AND 
BLACKBURN DID THE DOUBLE TO SEASONS 
AGO ROQUE SANTA CRUZ IS ONE GOAL 
SHOAL OF TWENTY IN HIS FIRST SEASON IN 
ENGLAND NEMANJA VIDIC IS BACK IN 
THE HEART OF THE MANCHESTER UNITED 
DEFENCE AFTER A THREE MATCH ABSENCE 
WITH A KNEE INJURY THEY ARE 
WITHOUT EDWIN VAN DER SAR OR AS A 
GREEN PROBLEM GROIN PROBLEM WHICH 
WILL NOT GIVE THEM OUT OF THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI FINAL AT 
BARCELONA TOMASZ KUSZCZAK 
DEPUTISES IN GOAL 
MANCHESTER UNITED GET IT AWAY ROB 
STYLES HAS A LITTLE LOOK NO MAJOR 
COMPLAINTS AND THE DANGER IS 
CLEARED 
RONALDO WITH THE SHOT WHICH TAKES 
A DEFLECTION AND MOMENTARILY HAD 
BRAD FRIEDEL SCRAMBLING THE FIRST 
DECISION OF THE GAME REQUIRED FROM 
ROB STYLES SCHOLES MADE A MESS OF 
GETTING THE BALL AWAY KUSZCZAK WAS 
COMMITTED 
KUSZCZAK DOES TOUCH THE BALL BEFORE 
ROBERTS COLLIDES WITH THEM MARK 
HUGHES' BODY LANGUAGE TELLS YOU 
WHAT HE THINKS OF THAT DECISION 
LAST YEAR'S ONE TO ZERO VICTORY IS THEIR 
ONLY WIN IN THEIR LAST SEVEN VISITS 
TO EWOOD PARK IN THE LEAGUE THAT WAS A GREAT CHANCE FOR TEVEZ 
BRAD FRIEDEL GOES MAD AT HIS 
DEFENDERS THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD 
CHANCE FOR MANCHESTER UNITED 
ROONEY ON THE EDGE OF THE PENALTY 
AREA LOOK AT TEVEZ COME RACING IN TEVEZ MISSES THE SHOT COMPLETELY THAT IS OFF WES BROWN IT FALLS FOR 
ROQUE SANTA CRUZ AND BLACKBURN 
ROVERS TAKE THE LEAD ROQUE SANTA 
CRUZ HAS TWENTY FOR THE SEASON AND 
MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE GOT WORK TO 
DO HERE TODAY BLACKBURN ROVERS 
WITH THE BREAKTHROUGH IT WAS A 
LUCKY BOUNCE THAT FELL AWAY AND CHELSEA FANS WILL BE SITTING UP 
AND TAKING NOTICE A ROCKY START 
FOR MANCHESTER UNITED HERE TWENTY 
MINUTES PLAYED HOW WILL MANCHESTER 
UNITED REACT BENTLEY GOES FOR GOAL AND KUSZCZAK 
IS NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY CHANCES IN 
THESE SWIRLING CONDITIONS THE 
PALMS IT OVER THE TOP FOR A CORNER 
WE KNOW BENTLEY CAN STRIKE AT FROM 
DISTANCE AND HE DID SO THERE THIS 
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TURN INTO A 
VERY AWKWARD AFTERNOON OR FOR THE 
LEADERS YOU WOULD NOT WANT A 
SEASON TICKET NEXT TO THAT 
GENTLEMAN WOULD YOU I WONDER IF 
HE KNOWS ANY OTHER TUNES INSIDE THE LAST TEN MINUTES OF THE 
FIRST HALF ROONEY FELT HE WAS 
CAUGHT BY REID WAYNE ROONEY STILL 
CLEARLY DISGRUNTLED ABOUT THE 
DECISION IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HE GOT CAUGHT 
BY STEVEN REID THAT IS WHY ROONEY 
IS NOT HAPPY BUT HE DID NOT GO 
DOWN AS A RESULT OF THAT CHALLENGE 
AND I THINK THAT THE REFEREE GOT 
THAT RIGHT IT LOOKED AS THOUGH ROONEY PUNCHED 
THE BALL THE RED MIST IS COMING 
DOWN A LITTLE BIT FOR WAYNE ROONEY 
AND HE GETS A YELLOW CARD YOU CAN 
SENSE THAT HE IS VERY FRUSTRATED 
ABOUT WHAT HE FEELS WAS A FOUL 
WELL THAT WAS WILD HE CERTAINLY 
PICKED ON SOMEONE WHO WAS BIGGER 
THAN HIM ANYWAY SANTA CRUZ HOLDING IT UP WELL NICE 
PLAY FROM BLACKBURN BENTLEY 
CORNER MORTEN GAMST PEDERSEN WITH THE CORNER KUSZCZAK WITH THE PUNCH CARRICK GOT THERE AND IT IS A CORNER AT THE OTHER END RONALDO GOOD SAVE BY FRIEDEL A 
GREAT SAVE BY THE BLACKBURN 
GOALKEEPER TO PRESERVE THEIR LEAD 
RONALDO WITH THE HEADER SAVED BY 
FRIEDEL BLACKBURN SAVED BY 
THE POST 
RONALDO HIT IT WELL IT BEAT BRAD FRIEDEL AND IT BOUNCES AWAY OFF THE UPRIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT CRISTIANO RONALDO AS AVERAGE ONE GOAL PER 
GAME TWENTY GOALS IN TWENTY APPEARANCES 
SINCE THE TURN OF THE YEAR NELSEN COMES ACROSS ON ROONEY HE 
STICKS HIS LEG OUT ROONEY IS ON 
THE FLOOR THAT WAS A COLLISION AT 
SOME SPEED THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN AWKWARD 
MOMENT THAT WAS SO CLOSE TO TWO TO ZERO 
PEDERSEN WORKING REALLY HARD FOR 
BLACKBURN ROVERS RIGHT ACROSS THE 
FACE OF THE GOAL SIX TIMES FOR 
ALEX FERGUSON HAS SEEN HIS TEAM 
BEHIND THIS SEASON TWICE THEY HAVE 
COME BACK TO WIN THREE TIMES THEY 
HAVE LOST WAYNE ROONEY CANNOT GET IT PAST BRAD FRIEDEL SCHOLES LOOKS FOR ROONEY AGAIN IT 
IS LAID OFF FOR RONALDO WHO HAS 
CHALLENGED IT IS SAVED ON THE 
LINE THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY AND 
IT STAYS AT ONE TO ZERO AND I CAN HARDLY 
BELIEVE IT HOW ABOUT THIS SOMEHOW IT DID NOT ROLL OVER THE 
LINE LOOK AT THIS CHALLENGE FROM 
JOHANN VOGEL HE JUST ABOUT GOT TO 
THE BALL THERE BUT IT WAS A TIGHT 
ONE IT WAS A GREAT SAVE BY BRAD FRIEDEL 
HE REALLY TOOK THE STING OUT OF 
THAT SHOT THEY MAY BE BEHIND BUT 
MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE SCORED SIXTEEN 
GOALS IN THE LAST TEN MINUTES OF 
GAMES THIS SEASON RYAN NELSEN MAKE THE BLOCK AND IT 
IS SCRAMBLED AWAY GREAT NOISE 
COMING FROM THE UNITED END 
BLACKBURN ARE UNDER THE COSH YOU 
WOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS ALL 
HANDS TO THE COLLECTIVE THUMP NOW THE FLAG GOES UP OUR SIDE 
OFFSIDE I WONDER WHETHER UNITED 
HAD A LITTLE SHOUT IN THERE AND IT 
DID STRIKE RED EMERTON ON THE ARM 
BRETT EMERTON A CHANCE FOR ROONEY ANOTHER GOOD 
SAVE BY BRAD FRIEDEL OUTSTANDING 
GOALKEEPER THAT HE IS HOW MANY 
TIMES HAS HE SAVED BLACKBURN ROVERS 
OVER THE YEARS HE CERTAINLY SAVED 
THEM THERE THAT WAS A LOVELY BALL 
A GOOD CHANCE AND AL VERY FINE STOP THE TITLE RACE IS BECOMING MORE 
INTERESTING BY THE MINUTE NANI 
FOULED MANCHESTER 
UNITED FREE KICK IT IS SAVED AGAIN MANCHESTER UNITED BEGAN ARE SHOUTING FOR HAND 
BALL INSIDE THE PENALTY AREA JOHN 
O'SHEA WONDERS HOW HE DID SCORE 
HOW HE DIDN'T SCORE THAT WAS A 
SENSATIONAL START THAT WAS A 
SENSATIONAL STOP IT COMES SCHOLES 
TEVEZ MANCHESTER UNITED DO IT 
THEY ARE OUT OF JAIL THREE MINUTES 
FROM TIME JUST WHEN THEY WERE ON 
THE BRINK OF LOSING IT CAME AND TEVEZ WAS IN THE RIGHT 
PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND AGAIN 
MANCHESTER UNITED SCORE LATE AND 
FINALLY BRAD FRIEDEL IS BEATEN TEVEZ GOES DOWN BUT DOES NOT GET A 
FREE KICK HE WANTS ONE BUT DOES 
NOT GET ONE AND IT IS THE FINAL 
ACTION OF THE MATCH MANCHESTER 
UNITED WITH A LATE SHOW GRAB AN 
EQUALISER THANKS TO CARLOS TEVEZ 
IT IS NOT THEIR DESIRED RESULTS 
BUT IT IS NOT A DREADFUL ONE FOR 
THEM THEY ARE STILL IN CONTROL OF 
THE SITUATION TEVEZ WITH THE 
EQUALISER TO ROQUE SANTA CRUZ'S 
OPENER IN THE FIRST HALF BRAD 
FRIEDEL WAS SIMPLY BRILLIANT IN 
GOAL FOR BLACKBURN THE MAN OF THE 
MATCH THOSE FANS THINK THE TITLE 
WILL STILL GO TO OLD TRAFFORD ONCE 
AGAIN CHELSEA AGAINST MANCHESTER 
UNITED NEXT SATURDAY WILL BE SOME 
OCCASION 
WE PLAYED WITH A LOT OF 
DETERMINATION AND A LOT OF 
CONVICTION IN THE SECOND HALF 
BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT WE WERE ABLE 
TO SCORE AND EVERYTHING WE DID IN 
THE SECOND HALF I THINK WE 
DESERVED SOMETHING MORE 
WHEN YOU 
PLAY ONE OF THE BEST TEAMS IN THE 
WORLD THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LAY 
DOWN AND DIE AND THEY DID NOT 
THEIR ATTACKING PLAY IS OUTSTANDING 
WE STILL HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN TWO 
TROPHIES BUT WE CAN LOSE TWO 
TROPHIES AND I THINK WE KNOW THAT 
AND WE WILL PREPARE WELL FOR THESE 
NEXT GAMES 
TODAY WAS A GAME THAT 
WE NEEDED TO IMPROVE IN AND WE 
CERTAINLY DID THAT WE CAUSED 
PROBLEMS TACTICALLY WE WERE SPOT 
ON WE CAUSED A PROBLEM IN THAT 
RESPECT IT'S LIKE I SAY WE WON 
NEARLY ABLE TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE 
WANTED YOU ALWAYS KNOW THAT UNITED 
WILL COME BACK AT TWO AND BY NATURE 
OF THE FACT THAT YOU PLAY FOR MAN 
UNITED AND THE 
AND THE 
DEMAND IT BUT A NEW YOU HAVE TO 
KEEP GOING UNTIL THE END 
HOW WAS 
WAYNE ROONEY HE HAD A COLLISION 
WITH RYAN NELSEN 
WE HOPE THAT HE 
WILL BE O. K. AT THE MOMENT HE IS 
STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT BUT WE 
BELIEVE THAT WEDNESDAY HE WILL BE 
FINE TO PLAY 
I THINK IT WILL GO 
RIGHT DOWN TO THE LAST WEEKEND OF 
THE SEASON L. STILL THINK THERE ARE 
TWISTS AND TURNS TO BE AT IN THIS 
LEAGUE SO IT IS A HUGE GAME FOR 
CHELSEA THEY NEED TO BEAT UNITED 
NEXT WEEK MAYBE THEY WILL LOOK AT 
THIS GAME AND THEY THERE WILL BE 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM 
HE PLAYED FOR BOTH SIDES WHAT 
FINALE QUITE SOMETHING MANCHESTER 
UNITED VERSUS BRAD FRIEDEL 
IT WAS 
A GREAT GAME OF FOOTBALL BOTH 
TEAMS DESERVE A LOT OF CREDIT FOR 
THAT BLACKBURN DESERVED THEIR LEAD 
AT HALF TIME AND CAUSED MANCHESTER 
UNITED ONE OR TWO PROBLEMS POOR 
DEFENDING FOR THE GOAL FROM 
FERDINAND VIDIC AND EVRA BUT YOU 
HAVE TO HAND IT TO MAN UNITED THE 
WAY THEY CAME BACK IN THE SECOND 
HALF THEY PINNED THEM BACK AND 
BUT FOR AN UNBELIEVABLE ALMOST FROM 
BRAD FRIEDEL THEY WOULD HAVE WON 
THAT GAME COMFORTABLY THEY HAVE 
JUST GOT SO MUCH FIREPOWER MAN 
UNITED AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE 
BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE 
LEAGUE BECAUSE OF THE THREE 
UPFRONT 
TEVEZ ROONEY AND RONALDO HAVE FIFTY TWO 
GOALS OUT OF THE SEVENTY THREE THAT MAN UNITED 
HAVE SCORED THIS SEASON 
AND THEY 
HAVE 
THE NEVER SAY DIE SPIRIT YEAH YEAH THE NEVER SAY DIE SPIRIT AN 
UNBELIEVABLE BELIEF THEY ALWAYS 
BELIEVE THEY CAN SCORE WHEN YOU 
HAVE SO MUCH FIREPOWER AND THEY 
ARE SO INTERCHANGEABLE AS WELL 
THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO MARK THEY 
ARE ALL QUICK BLACKBURN DID GREAT 
JUST TO HOLD ON YOU ARE WATCHING 
IT THINKING THEY ARE GOING TO GET 
AWAY WITH THIS BLACKBURN IF THEY 
HAD GOT AWAY WITH IT THERE MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN A FEW COMPLAINTS ABOUT 
ONE OR TWO PENALTY DECISIONS 
YES THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT IT WAS A TACKLE BY STEVEN REID ON 
WAYNE ROONEY HE CATCHES HIS LEFT 
LEG I THINK THE REFEREE GOT THIS 
RIGHT 
HE JUST GETS THE BALL JUST RIGHT CATCHES IT IT IS NOT A PENALTY FOR 
ME 
THIS WAS THE STONEWALLER FOR ME ME THE CROOK OF HIS ARM HE CAN GET 
OUT OF THE WAY NO DOUBT ABOUT IT 
THAT IS A PENALTY 
BUT IT DID NOT SPOIL THE GAME 
MANCHESTER UNITED SHOULD HAVE HAD A 
PENALTY 
THAT WAS A POSSIBLE PENALTY HANDBALL THE ONE PERSON WHO DID 
USE HIS HANDS TO GOOD EFFECT WAS 
BRAD FRIEDEL WE HAVE SEEN HIM DO 
THIS SO MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS 
WE SAID THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO 
ABOUT HOW MANY POINTS HE HAS FOR 
BLACKBURN IN HIS SEASON IT JUST 
GOES TO SHOW THAT WAS BASIC SAVE 
HE PROBABLY SEES IT LATE FOR ME 
THIS WAS THE BEST ONE THE REACTION 
TO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO POWERFUL 
HE GETS A HAND TO IT THAT WAS THE 
BEST FOR ME 
THIS WAS NOT R. AWAY 
IT IS DOWN VERY LOW HE HIT IT 
EARLY ROONEY HE GETS A STRONG 
RIGHT HAND ON IT 
YOU WONDER IF IT 
WILL BE BRAD FRIEDEL'S DAY HE GETS 
HIS RIGHT HAND TO IT ANOTHER GREAT 
SAVE HE THROWS TEVEZ OUT OF THE WAY 
INTO THE LINE OF THE BALL THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE SAVED THAT 
WHEN YOU HAVE GOT TEVEZ AND RONALDO 
AND ROONEY ONE OF THEM WILL GET 
YOU AT SOME STAGE 
IF YOU KEEP TWO 
OF THEM QUIET YOU KNOW THEY WILL 
STILL CREATE CHANCES YOU KNOW THEY 
WILL SCORE BECAUSE THEY ARE THAT 
GOOD 
THIS RESULT HAS GIVEN CHELSEA GOOD A GLIMMER OF HOPE A DEFEAT WOULD 
HAVE MADE THINGS DIFFERENT 
YOU WOULD EXPECT MANCHESTER UNITED 
TO BEAT WEST HAM AT HOME ONE MIGHT 
HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SAVED 
ANYWAY L. STILL THINK MANCHESTER 
UNITED WILL WIN 
AND I DO L. CANNOT 
SEE THEM BEING BEATEN FROM THIS 
POSITION 
CHELSEA HAVE GOT TO BEAT POSITION THEM THAT'S FOR SURE 
LET'S SWITCH OUR ATTENTION NOW TO 
THE FIGHT TO AVOID RELEGATION 
BOLTON WENT INTO THEIR GAME AT 
MIDDLESBROUGH ENTRENCHED IN THE 
BOTTOM THREE BACK TO BACK WINS FOR 
THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON WOULD 
CERTAINLY EASE THE PRESSURE WELL MIDDLESBROUGH COULD BE 
MATHEMATICALLY ASSURED OF ANOTHER 
SEASON OF PREMIER LEAGUE FOOTBALL 
WITH VICTORY THREE POINTS FOR 
BOLTON WOULD ELEVATE THEM OUT OF 
THE DROP ZONE A PIVOTAL DAY WHICH 
BORO FACE WITHOUT MARK SCHWARZER 
ROSS TURNBULL MAKES HIS THIRD START 
OF THE CAMPAIGN AS THE AUSSIE 
NURSES A BACK PROBLEM THE 
SUSPENSION OF KEVIN DAVIES GIVES 
RASIAK A CHANCE HE MAY WELL LEAD 
THE LINE TO THE END OF THE SEASON 
THERE ARE TWO OTHER CHANGES REALISTICALLY BOLTON MUST DO TODAY 
WHAT THEY HAVE NOT MANAGED FOR TWELVE 
YEARS AND WIN AT THE RIVERSIDE 
MIDDLESBROUGH THOUGH NOT 
MATHEMATICALLY SAFE ARE 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY FEELING THEY ARE 
THERE I AM SURE IT WAS A GOOD SAVE BY ALI AL HABSI IN FOR JUSSI JAASKELAINEN WITH SAVES LIKE THAT HE HAS A BIG PART TO PLAY GOOD EFFORT WHISTLED OVER THE BAR 
AND MIDDLESBROUGH BEGIN THEY ARE 
ROCKING BOLTON WANDERERS THAT 
COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN A HEADER 
INSIDE THE OPENING EXCHANGES 
COULD HAVE BEEN AHEAD A TERRIFIC EFFORT FROM THONGCHAI 
JAIDEE AND AL HABSI'S EFFORTS ONCE 
AGAIN COME TO BOLTON'S AID ALI AL HABSI IS KEEPING THEM IN THE 
GAME THE CORNER COUNT RISES AS 
WELL THERE IS CONFUSION IN THE 
AREA TAYLOR JUST OVER THE BAR 
THEY ARE PEPPERING THE BOLTON GOAL 
BUT IT REMAINS ZERO TO ZERO ALI AL HABSI IS 
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY IT HAS JUST FLIPPED OVER THE BAR MIDDLESBROUGH RAPPING ON THE DOOR 
HERE WE HAVE NOT EVEN REACHED THE 
TEN MINUTE MARK GREAT START FOR 
GARETH SOUTHGATE'S SIDE AND PROOF 
IF IT WERE NEEDED THAT THERE IS 
STILL PLENTY FOR THEM TO PLAY FOR BOLTON WANDERERS HAVE NOT WON ANY 
OF THEIR LAST SEVEN TRIPS HERE TO 
MIDDLESBROUGH FIVE DEFEATS AND TWO 
DRAWS THEY GOT HAMMERED FIVE TO ONE LAST 
SEASON AT THE MOMENT THEY HAVE 
YET TO THREATEN ALTHOUGH TAYLOR 
CAME CLOSE THERE THAT WAS THEIR 
FIRST SHOT ON TARGET TURNBULL'S 
SAVE WAS VITAL IT IS THE FIRST TIME BOLTON HAVE 
BROKEN MIDDLESBROUGH DOWN 
TURNBULL'S REACTIONS WERE EXCELLENT 
TO DENY TAYLOR IT WAS A GOOD BLOCK BY TAYLOR BY 
TURNBULL HE WAS THERE AGAIN FROM 
THE CORNER THERE ARE AROUND TWO THOUSAND 
WHO HAVE MADE THEIR WAY FROM BOLTON 
FREE TRAVEL OFFERED BY THE CLUB 
ALL COACHES WERE SNAPPED UP A 
HEADER FROM WHEATER IT IS A GOAL 
KICK WHEATER CLAIMS A CORNER 
PERHAPS HE THREW HIMSELF AT IT BUT 
DID NOT GET A TOUCH TO IT HIT IT CRISPLY BUT NOT ACCURATELY AT LEAST THEY ARE STARTING TO OPEN MIDDLESBROUGH UP A LITTLE IT IS A CORNER CAN MIDDLESBROUGH END THE HALF AS THEY BEGAN IT O'BRIEN IN THE WAY HE WAS LEANING 
INTO IT AND HIS LEFT ARM WAS 
CERTAINLY CLOSE TO THE BALL WAS IT 
A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO HANDLE THE 
BALL I DO NOT THINK IT WAS RASIAK GOES FOR A GOAL IT IS OUT FOR A CORNER BOLTON 
THREATENING IN THE EARLY EXCHANGES 
HERE AFTER THE BREAK SO CLOSE TO HIS FIRST PREMIER 
LEAGUE GOAL HOW IMPORTANT IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN FOR BOLTON WAS THAT HANDBALL BY MCCANN IT 
LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ALAN WILEY WAS 
CERTAIN 
THAT IT WAS NOT THAT IS HANDBALL ALAN WILEY SAYING THAT MCCANN DID NOT HANDLE STEWART DOWNING'S CROSS IT IS A TEASER IT IS STILL NOT CLEARED OFF THE 
POST TAYLOR BATTLING CLAIMS OF 
HANDBALL AT THE END OF IT THEY 
HAVE A CORNER BOLTON NOW CLAIMING 
HANDBALL THE BOLTON FANS ARE 
ADAMANT MATT TAYLOR BELIEVES IT 
WAS THE POST CAME TO 
MIDDLESBROUGH'S RESCUE THAT WAS 
THE HANDBALL CLAIM AGAINST WHEATER ACTION AT BOTH ENDS IT IS IN BY 
MCCANN CAHILL'S HEADER AND MCCANN 
ON THE REBOUND BOLTON ARE IN 
DREAMLAND THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN 
RETAIN THEIR PREMIER LEAGUE STATUS 
AND SO DOES HE THERE WAS CHAOS IN THE AREA 
CAHILL'S HEADER IT WAS OFF THE 
LINE IT WAS A HAND FROM TURNBULL 
AND THEN MCCANN TURNED IN THE 
REBOUND I WONDERED IF IT WAS A DEFENDER 
BUT IT WAS TURNBULL WHO SAVED IT 
HE COULD DO NOTHING TO PREVENT 
MCCANN TURNING IN THE REBOUND 
BOLTON ARE SEARCHING FOR BACK TO 
BACK WINS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A 
YEAR COULD BE ON THEIR WAY TO IT CLAIMS OF HANDBALL ESPECIALLY FROM 
THOSE CLOSEST TO IT ALVAREZ AND 
ALIADIERE IT WAS A RICOCHET THAT STRUCK 
TAYLOR I DO NOT THINK YOU CAN GIVE 
THAT ONE TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT MCCANN 
GOAL IT WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT 
BOLTON HAVE SCORED IN MORE THAN SIX 
HOURS OF FOOTBALL AWAY FROM THE 
REEBOK HE WENT FOR GOAL AND THE ELEMENT 
OF SURPRISE ALMOST CAUGHT OUT AL 
HABSI SHOT TOOK A RICOCHET AL HABSI'S POSITIONING WAS SPOT ON ALL EYES PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO 
SUPPORT BOLTON WANDERERS ON ALAN 
WILEY AND HE BLOWS THE WHISTLE BOLTON 
CELEBRATE TWO WINS IN A ROW JUST 
WHEN THEY NEEDED THEM MOST IT 
LOOKED AS THOUGH IT WAS ALL OVER 
FOR THEM WHEN THEY TRUDGED OFF AT 
VILLA PARK A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO 
BUT COURTESY OF A ONE TO ZERO WIN AGAINST 
WEST HAM LAST WEEK AND A GAVIN 
MCCANN GOAL TODAY SUDDENLY BOLTON 
CAN BELIEVE THAT THEIR TENURE IN 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE MIGHT EXTEND TO 
EIGHT YEARS IN A ROW NOW IT HAS 
FINISHED AT THE RIVERSIDE 
TODAY WAS NOT A CLASSIC BY ANY 
MEANS WE SAID OF REALLY POORLY 
PROBABLY FORTUNATE TO COME IN AT 
HALF TIME ZERO TO ZERO BUT IN THE 
SECOND TIME WE PLAYED HOW WE 
NORMALLY PLAY AT THE REMARK WE GOT 
A DECENT RESULT IT WAS PROBABLY 
THE CLASSIC CASE OF GAME OF TWO HEARTS 
WHAT ABOUT THE HANDBALL HEARTS COURT DO YOU FEEL YOU SHOULD HAVE 
HAD A PENALTY 
YEAH I DO IT WAS 
ZERO TO ZERO AT THE TIME SO THAT WOULD HAVE 
CHANGED THE GAME L. THINK THEY HAD 
A POSSIBLE SHOUT LATER BUT IT HAS 
NOT GONE FOR US WE ARE IN CONTROL 
OF OUR OWN DESTINY WE DID NOT DO 
ENOUGH TO WIN THE GAME IN THE 
SECOND HALF 
THE FANS WERE GREAT 
TODAY THE FREE TRAVEL BROUGHT A 
LOT OF FANS OVER THE DAY WE SHOULD 
DO THAT AGAINST TOTTENHAM BUT THAT 
DEFINITELY HELPED EVERYONE'S 
WORKING ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THE PRESSURE IS ON 
AND THE LADS DON'T WITH A TWELVE 
A MASSIVE WIN FOR BOLTON HOW 
CRUCIAL COULD THAT BE 
ONLY TIME 
WILL TELL BUT THEY HAVE GIVEN 
THEMSELVES A REAL CHANCE WITH TWO 
WINS ON THE SPIN MIDDLESBROUGH 
WERE UNRECOGNISABLE FROM THEIR LAST 
HOME GAME AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED 
WHEN THEY WERE SO PASSIONATE AND 
ENTHUSIASTIC HAVING SAID THAT IN 
THE FIRST FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES THEY 
HAD SO MANY CHANCES AND THEY SHOULD 
HAVE PUT A GAME OUT OF REACH FOR 
BOLTON BUT THEY DID NOT IN THAT 
CASE YOU GET PUNISHED GARY MEGSON 
SAID IT WAS NOT PRETTY BUT IT DOES 
NOT HAVE TO BE AT THIS STAGE IT 
HAS TO BE EFFECTIVE AND IT WORKED 
FOR THEM 
GARETH SOUTHGATE SAID IT 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PENALTY WHAT 
WAS YOUR VIEW 
I THOUGHT IT SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN A PENALTY AS WELL 
STEWART DOWNING GETS THE BALL OUT 
WIDE HERE HE WHIPS A GOOD BALL IN 
WHEN THEY ARE SO CLOSE YOU DO NOT 
GET THEM BUT THE DISTANCE FOR ME 
THE DISTANCE IS ELEVEN METRES SO HE 
HAS GOT PLENTY OF TIME TO GET IT 
OUT HAVE A LOOK AT THE REFEREE 
POSITION HE HAS GOT A GOOD VIEW OF 
IT 
IT CLEARLY IT'S HIS HAND FROM A 
DISTANCE AND IT SHOULD BE A PENALTY 
GARETH HAS GOT A POINT 
WE HAVE 
SEEN BOLTON ENJOY A LOT OF SUCCESS 
FROM SET PIECES AND ULTIMATELY 
THAT IS HOW THEY GOT THEIR WIN 
TODAY 
THEY DID A BIG PART OF THEIR GAME 
OVER THE YEARS FROM 
MIDDLESBROUGH'S POINT OF VIEW POOR 
DEFENDING RASIAK LATER GOES OFF 
WE HAVE GOT ENCIRCLED WITH 
ALIADIERE WHO IS MARKING HIM A 
FREE HEADER HE HITS THE BAR BUT 
RASIAK HAS GONE OFF IT IS STENSON 
HE WAS THERE ALIADIERE IS MARKING 
ON THE FRONT NO ONE IS MARKING 
STEINSSON HE COMES OFF IN THE SAME 
POSITION DOWNING IS NOT MARKING 
HIM NOW WHAT A BIG TAP IN THAT 
HAS GIVEN THEM HUGE BELIEF 
A COLD SPRING MORNING IN THE NORTH 
WEST AT HER MAJESTY'S PRISON THE 
DAILY ROUTINE IS A LITTLE BIT 
DIFFERENT POT FOR SOME OF THE 
OFFENDERS HERE TODAY IS A LITTLE 
OUT OF THE ORDINARY AFTER ALL IT 
IS NOT EVERY DAY THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE'S NEWEST CENTURY MAKER PAYS 
A VISIT 
IT IS KEVIN DAVIES WHOSE CAUSE I I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE 
BEEN INSIDE THE WALLS OF PRISON BUT 
WHAT HAVE YOU MADE OF WHAT YOU HAVE 
SEEN TODAY 
GOOD YEAH OBSERVING 
REALLY AND SEEING WHAT PEOPLE ARE 
TRYING 
TO ACHIEVE L. CAN SEE LADS TO HAVE BEEN WORKING QUITE HARD AND PRACTISING 
THESE PLAYERS ALSO PRACTISING JOINED THE SESSION PART OF THE 
PRINCE'S TRUST SCHEME DESIGNED TO 
GIVE JELLE PRISON INMATES A FORMAL 
QUALIFICATION AND HOPEFULLY A STEP 
TOWARDS REFORMING THEIR LIVES WE WE ARE TAKING THE UNPEOPLE SIX MONTHS 
OFF RELEASE AND BUILDING OF THEIR 
OWN SELF CONFIDENCE SELF ESTEEM 
PUTTING THEM IN A SITUATION THEY 
HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THE FOURTH PUTTING 
THEM IN A POSITION OF 
RESPONSIBILITY TO EXPLAIN TO OTHER 
YOUNG CHILDREN WHAT TO DO IT HAD 
TO DO IT WE ARE USING FOOTBALL TO 
DO THAT 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE THE 
PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLERS' 
ASSOCIATION AND THE FOOTBALL 
FOUNDATION ARE FUNDING THE TWO 
MILLION SCHEME WHICH HAS A PROVEN 
TRACK RECORD IN REFORMING YOUNG 
OFFENDERS PEOPLE LIKE LEIGHTON 
WHO HAS NOW TURNED HIS BACK ON 
CRIME AND WILL START A UNIVERSITY 
COURSE IN DECEMBER 
I DID BERY 
AND GOT THREE AND A HALF YEARS IT 
WAS A SHOCK REALLY HE DO THE SAME 
THING EVERY DAY AND TO DO SOMETHING 
LIKE THIS IT IS A LIFETIME THING 
REALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T TAKE 
THAT CHANCE YOU'RE NOT WORTHLESS 
YOU ARE NOT JUST A CRIMINAL YOU 
ARE SOMEBODY AND JURY PERSON A LOT 
OF PEOPLE HAVE NOT HAD THAT NO ONE 
HAS SAID WELL DONE THAT IS GOOD 
A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT IN SCHOOL 
THEY THINK THEY HAVE FAILED IN LIFE 
SO WE LOOK WITH SEVENTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE 
GOING FROM THIS SCHEME TO OTHER 
PROGRAMMES AND WITH SEVEN THOUSAND 
PARTICIPANTS HOPES ARE HIGH THAT 
THE YOUNGSTERS HERE WILL GO ON AND 
LEAVE BEHIND A LIFE OF CRIME 
PEOPLE DON'T LISTEN UNTIL YOU 
ACTUALLY SEE IN PERSON THAT IS WHY 
THESE PEOPLE HAVE COME HERE TODAY 
TO TRY AND SHOW YOU IT DOES WORK 
LOOKS LIKE A GOOD SKIER THERE 
BOLTON HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES 
CHANCE OF AVOIDING THE DROP COULD 
FOLLOW POSSIBLY DO THE SAME AGAINST 
LIVERPOOL THEY HAVE BEATEN THEM AT 
CRAVEN COTTAGE IN THE LAST TWO 
MEETINGS 
THE ONE TO ZERO WIN OVER A WEAKENED 
LIVERPOOL TEAM ALLOWED FULHAM TO 
SCRAMBLE TO SAFETY LAST SEASON AND 
THEY WILL BE HOPING HISTORY REPEATS 
ITSELF TO GIVE THEM CHANCE OF SURVIVAL THIS TIME FULHAM ARE UNCHANGED FROM THEIR 
VICTORY AT READING WHICH ENDED 
THEIR DISMAL RECENT RUN CLIPS 
DEMPSEY SCORED THE WINNER IN THE 
CORRESPONDING GAME TWELVE MONTHS AGO 
AND KEEPS HIS PLACE IN MIDFIELD 
CLINT DEMPSEY EIGHT CHANGES FOR 
LIVERPOOL BUT HARDLY A TEAM OF 
UNTRIED YOUNGSTERS JAVIER 
MASCHERANO IS BACK FOLLOWING A 
THREE MATCH DOMESTIC BAN WHILE 
SAMMY HYYPIA MAKES HIS THREE 
HUNDREDTH LEAGUE APPEARANCE 
FERNANDO TORRES IS ON THE BENCH NOT TOO FAR AWAY BY PETER CROUCH A 
DECENT BALL IN FROM JERMAINE 
PENNANT HIGH INTO THE PENALTY AREA 
AND CROUCH COULD NOT AIMED THE BALL 
TOWARDS THE FAR POST RICK PARRY 
THE LIVERPOOL CHIEF EXECUTIVE MUST 
BE HAPPY TO CONCENTRATE ON A GAME 
OF FOOTBALL FOR A CHANGE A BRILLIANT GOAL BY JERMAINE 
PENNANT LOOKING TO MAKE POINT TO 
RAFA BENITEZ HE HAS DONE JUST THAT 
FOREIGN IN GIVEN FAR TOO MUCH TIME 
IN THE MIDFIELD VORONIN 
HANGELAND WAS ALWAYS STRUGGLING 
PENNANT'S FINISH WAS VERY ASSURED 
KASEY KELLER BE DONE AT THE NEAR 
POST BUT IN REALITY HE HAD VERY 
LITTLE CHANCE AND THAT IS A REAL 
BODY BLOW TO FULHAM'S HOPES OF 
SURVIVAL RIISE WAS THERE CLEARED AWAY BY 
STALTERI LIVERPOOL WERE INCHES 
AWAY FROM A SECOND GOAL VORONIN 
AND PENNANT INVOLVED ONCE AGAIN 
RESEARCH JUST COULD NOT SCOOP THE 
BALL BACK IN RIISE RAFA BENITEZ 
PROMISED A SIDE WHICH WOULD GO OUT 
TO WIN THIS GAME AND SO FAR HE HAS 
BEEN PROVED RIGHT A BACKHEEL FROM SAMMY HYYPIA BULLARD WITH THE FREE KICK HEALY HAS DONE WELL CLEARED AWAY 
BY LUKAS HANGELAND IN THE END 
HEADS WIDE A VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY 
HANGELAND WITH THE HEADER IT CAME 
TO HIM VERY QUICKLY AND HE COULD 
NOT QUITE DIRECTED TOWARDS GOAL 
BUT WHEN YOU LIE IN RELEGATION 
DOGFIGHT YOU NEED THOSE BREAKS TO 
GO FOR YOU KASEY KELLER WAS FOULED BUT YET 
AGAIN FULHAM AT FULL STRETCH AS 
LIVERPOOL TRIED TO KILL HIS GAME 
OFF CROUCH AS WON ABSOLUTELY 
EVERYTHING IN THE AIR SO FAR TODAY NICE FROM LIVERPOOL CLEARED BY 
HANGELAND A LIVERPOOL CORNER AND 
JAVIER MASCHERANO HAS THIS GAME IN 
THE PALM OF HIS HAND OVERHEAD KICK FROM FOREIGN MEN WAS 
NOT TOO FAR AWAY HAD THAT BEEN ON 
TARGET I THINK KASEY KELLER MAY 
HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING ALMOST TOO EASY FOR LIVERPOOL AT TIMES BENAYOUN WITH THE SHOT BLOCKED BY 
STALTERI LIVERPOOL WILL FEEL THEY 
SHOULD HAVE SCORED THE SECOND GOAL 
THE SHOT WAS FROM BENAYOUN AND 
BLOCKED BY STALTERI PAICE SECOND 
GOAL WOULD SURELY FINISH FULHAM OFF 
SECOND GOAL IT IS TURNING INTO A VERY 
FRUSTRATING DAY FOR THE HOME FANS 
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE GOT FREE KICK THE HIGH BALL WAS HEADED TOWARDS 
GOAL ALTHOUGH THE FLAG WAS UP ON 
THE FAR SIDE CLINT DEMPSEY 
GLANCING A HEADER IN BUT IT 
DRIFTED WIDE OF THE FAR POST AND 
THE FLAG WAS UP ANYWAY TOO MUCH SPACE FOR CROUCH A SECOND 
GOAL FOR LIVERPOOL PETER CROUCH 
WRAPS UP THE POINTS AND FULHAM'S 
LIFE BEGINS TO BED IT AWAY PETER 
CROUCH WAS GIVEN FAR TOO MUCH SPACE 
INSIDE THE PENALTY AREA AND HIS 
SHOT WAS TOO HOT FOR KASEY KELLER 
TO HANDLE PENNANT WHO THEN SCORED 
THE FIRST MAKING THE SECOND BUT 
WHEN YOU ARE IN A RELEGATION BATTLE 
YOU SIMPLY CANNOT DEFEND LIKE THAT 
FAR TOO MUCH TIME FOR CROUCH AND 
HE WILL RARELY HAVE SIMPLE GOAL THAN THAT HE MUST BE VERY VERY SATISFIED 
JAVIER MASCHERANO RECEIVES 
TREMENDOUS RECEPTION AS HE MAKES 
HIS WAY TO THE LIVERPOOL DRESSING 
ROOM REINA'S FIRST REAL SAVE OF THE DAY TENTATIVE IN THE END FROM JIMMY 
BULLARD BUT DANNY MURPHY HAD A 
REAL CHANCE TO PUT FULHAM BACK INTO 
THE GAME A THIRST REAL CLEAR SIGHT 
OF GOAL AND REINA BLOCKED IT WITH 
HIS REDS WITH HIS LEGS REINA NOW WITH A DECENT SAVE 
ALTHOUGH THE FLAG WAS UP CAMERA 
DID WELL TO MANUFACTURE THE CROSS 
IT TOOK A DEFLECTION OFF SKRTEL 
AND THAT WAS DECENT SAVE FROM 
REINA WHO DID NOT KNOW THE FLAG 
WAS UP FOR OFFSIDE KAMARA POSSIBLY THE CLOSEST FULHAM HAVE 
COME THE SHOT DEFLECTED INCHES 
WIDE ON A DAY WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN 
WELL SHORT OF BEATING LIVERPOOL IT IS A MISERABLE DAY WEATHER WISE 
AND IT HAS BEEN MISERABLE DAY OF 
FOOTBALL FOR THESE FULHAM 
SUPPORTERS THERE MUST NOW BE 
CONTEMPLATING LIFE IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP NEXT SEASON 
CAN YOU STILL RETAINS SOME KIND OF 
HOPE 
OF COURSE WE RETAIN HOPE BUT HOPE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO GET A 
RESULT TODAY TO SOME EXTENT WE 
THREATENS DURING THE GAME TO GET A 
RESULT BUT WE DID THAT AND THE 
TASK GETS HARDER WE HAVE NOT 
RECOVERED ANY POINTS ON THE TEAMS 
BELOW US AND WE HAVE LOST ANOTHER 
GAME AND ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY 
ABOVE US 
IN PREVIOUS YEARS YOU 
HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE STRENGTH AND 
DEPTH OF YOUR SQUAD IS IT IMPROVE 
ON WHAT YOU HAVE HAD PREVIOUSLY I I WAS TALKING THE WHOLE SEASON ABOUT 
THIS BEING BETTER THAN BEFORE SO 
NOW WE HAVE PROVED THAT WE HAVE 
SOME PLAYERS THAT ARE GOOD ENOUGH 
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WEAKENED TEAM 
BUT AS FAR AS LIVERPOOL ARE 
CONCERNED NOT SO 
IT IS AN 
IMPORTANT GAME FOR US AND WE HAVE 
GOT TO MAKE SURE WE FINISH FOURTH AND 
GET A CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SPOT NEXT 
YEAR WE HAVE OPENED UP A BIT OF A 
GAP SO WE ARE CONFIDENT WE CAN DO 
THAT NOW 
HOPING TO PLAY A ROLE ON 
TUESDAY 
I WOULD LOVE TO THAT IT TUESDAY IS NOT OFTEN A CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
SEMI FINAL COMES AROUND SO ALL THE 
PLAYERS WILL BE HOPING TO START DO DO YOU HOPE ALL THE FOCUS WILL BE ON 
FOOTBALL 
I HOPE SO FOOTBALL IS FOOTBALL THE KEY TO DOING A GOOD GAME A A HUGE GAME NEXT WEEK HOW TO LIFT 
THE PLAYERS 
IT WILL TAKE A BIT OF 
TIME THEY WILL BE DISAPPOINTED 
BUT I THINK THEY KNOW THERE IS 
ENOUGH FOOTBALL IN THE TEAM TO GET 
RESULTS WE HAVE PROBABLY GOT TO 
GET AT LEAST SEVEN POINTS AT A BARE 
MINIMUM BUT LET'S GO FOR IT THERE 
IS NOTHING ELSE TO SAY 
KEEP GOING FOR IT BUT IT IS 
LOOKING PRETTY DESPERATE 
THEY WERE 
COMPLETELY OUTPLAYED TODAY FULHAM 
THEY DID NOT FORCE REINA TO MAKE A 
SAVE UNTIL THEY WERE TWO TO ZERO DOWN AND 
LIVERPOOL STILL HAVE LOTS OF 
CHANCES THE RESULT AT THE READING 
LAST WEEK GO ON AND HOME GAME 
AGAINST LIVERPOOL LIVERPOOL WERE 
PLAYING A WEAKENED SIDE BUT 
NOTHING FROM FULHAM TALKING ABOUT 
THAT WEAKENED SIDE A LOT WAS 
ALWAYS GOING TO BE MADE ABOUT THE 
TEAM AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR 
BUT THIS IS TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
THIS IS THE TEAM THAT HE PLAYED 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO ARGUE THAT THERE 
ARE PLAYERS THERE WHO WON NOT 
PLAYING FOR LIVERPOOL ANY MORE 
THAT WAS A WEAKENED TEAM TODAY'S 
WAS MUCH MUCH STRONGER AND THE 
WHOLE THING ABOUT THE MANAGER 
PICKING A TEAM TO WIN THE GAME 
THAT IS WHAT HE DID TODAY IT IS 
HIS PROBLEM ALONE NOBODY ELSE'S 
PROBLEM THE TEAM THAT HE PICKED 
TODAY IT WENT ON TO WIN THE GAME 
WHEN YOU LOOK 
COMFORTABLY AS 
WELL 
AT TIMES THEY WERE RAMPANT SOME OF 
THE FOOTBALL WAS VERY GOOD 
REMEMBER THERE'S NO GERRARD AND NO 
TORRES THE TWO BEST PLAYERS 
FULHAM IN ALL HONESTY CONTRIBUTED 
TO THEIR OWN DOWNFALL NO PRESSURE 
ON THE BALL VERY SQUARE ACROSS 
MIDFIELD 
THE BACK FOUR OF VERY SQUARE ONE 
BALL BEATS ALL FOUR JERMAINE 
PENNANT TAKES THE GOAL WELL WHEN 
WE SHOW YOU THIS ANGLE AMERICANS 
UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY HAVE HAD 
NIGHTMARE THIS WEEK AND KASEY 
KELLER IS ONE OF THEM NO DOUBT 
ABOUT THAT THAT INCLUDES THE 
OWNERS OF LIVERPOOL BY THE WAY 
SOME OF THE FOOTBALL WAS EXCELLENT 
PASSING MOVEMENT APPRECIATION OF 
SPACE THEY REALLY DID STRETCH 
FULHAM THROUGHOUT THE GAME THE 
OTHER THING IS THAT FULHAM MOVES 
THE BALL SO MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THE 
WRONG SIDE OF THE BALL IT IS GOOD 
EVERY LIVERPOOL PLAYER HAS AN 
OPTION EVERYBODY LOOKS TO MOVE THE 
BALL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THEY 
CREATED LOTS AND LOTS OF CHANCES 
AND WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE GERRARD 
AND YOU DO NOT HAVE TORRES AND YOU 
PLAY LIKE THIS GOING INTO THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE AGAINST CHELSEA 
SO MUCH SPACE FULHAM LIVERPOOL 
COULD HAVE WON MUCH MORE EASILY KELLER HAD A POOR DAY IT HAS BEEN A STRANGE FEW WEEKS 
ON THE PITCH THEY HAVE WON NINE 
GAMES EVERYONE KNOWS IT IS A 
COMPLETE MESS IT WAS SO BAD IT 
WAS FRIGHTENING HE IS TRYING TO 
MAKE OUT THAT HE IS NOT THE VILLAIN 
OF THE PIECE IT IS DIFFICULT THEY 
DO NOT GET ON THEY DO NOT SPEAK TO 
EACH OTHER ONE OF THEM HAS TO SELL 
TO THE OTHER FOR THE CLUB TO GO 
FORWARD 
AS AN OUTSIDER HAVING NO FORWARD CONNECTIONS WITH LIVERPOOL 
LIVERPOOL HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GREAT ON 
THE PITCH AND ALSO OFF THE PITCH 
OVER THE YEARS EVERYONE HAS ALWAYS 
SAID THAT IT IS SO POOR AND SO SAD 
TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING OFF THE 
PITCH ONE OF THEM HAS TO GIVE WAY 
BECAUSE IT WILL DAMAGE THE FOOTBALL 
CLUB 
BENITEZ MIGHT WALK IN ONE DAY CLUB AND SAY I HAVE HAD ENOUGH L. AM OFF OFF READING WERE ONE OF THOSE SIDES 
COMFORTABLY PERCHED ABOVE THE DROP 
ZONE THEY HAD THE TOUGH TASK OF 
SCRAPPING 
FOR POINTS AT ARSENAL WITH ARSENE WENGER STILL AMBITIOUS FOR SECOND PLACE THEO WALCOTT IS 
BROUGHT IN TO ADD PACE TO AN 
ARSENAL SIDE WHO NEED TO SAVE FACE 
READING NOW FIGHTING TO SAVE THEIR 
PREMIER PLACE DRASTICALLY NOW MAKE 
SIX CHANGES THAT WAS A CLEVER PASS HE POKED IT HE KNEW THEY WERE GETTING BACK AT HIM LOVELY PASS ALEXANDER HLEB JUST LACKED THAT 
EXTRA PACE TO GET AWAY IT COULD BE 
THE LOWEST CROWD OF THE SEASON HERE 
FOR LOT OF THE ARSENAL FANS THE 
END OF THE CAMPAIGN CANNOT COME 
SOON ENOUGH WALCOTT WINS A CORNER THE REFEREE OVERRULED THE ASSISTANT GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ARSENAL TO 
TAKE THE LEAD AND THEY SQUANDERED 
IT DANGEROUS CROSS I CANNOT REMEMBER EVER IN HIS TOP 
FLIGHT MANAGERIAL CAREER EITHER AT 
CRYSTAL PALACE OR READING STEVE 
COPPELL MAKING SO MANY CHANGES FOR 
ONE LEAGUE GAME A CHANCE 
FOR ARSENAL SLID AWAY BY SONKO ARSENAL'S MOST DANGEROUS MOVE OF THE GAME SO FAR THE REFEREE IMMEDIATELY REACHING FOR HIS POCKET I DO NOT THINK DAVE KITSON CAN REALLY ARGUE IT IS VAN PERSIE IT WENT WIDE A 
CORNER IS GIVEN DO NOT THINK THE 
REFEREE GOT CLEAR VIEW OF IT 
FROM READING'S CTION I DO NOT THINK HAHNEMANN TOUCHED IT FROM THAT ANGLE HE MIGHT HAVE DONE ANOTHER ARSENAL SHORT CORNER THE ARSENAL PRESSURE GROWS ARSENAL BUILDING UP A MOMENTUM A CHANCE FOR ARSENAL'S LEAD AND 
THIS TIME THEY TAKE IT THEIR TOP 
SCORER MAKES IT TWENTY SEVEN GOALS THIS 
SEASON AND FOUR ARE IN HIS LAST 
FIVE GAMES THE MOMENTUM GREW ON THE RIGHT 
WALCOTT HAS BEEN PROMISING THERE 
WAS THE ERROR BY SONKO IT COULD BE 
SUCH COSTLY MISTAKE THE CENTRE 
HALF GOT IT ALL WRONG ADEBAYOR IN 
COMMANDING FORM GIVES ARSENAL THE 
LEAD AFTER HALF AN HOUR IT LOOPED IN ARSENAL HAVE A SECOND 
IN MANY WAYS IT HAS BEEN 
MISERABLE SEASON FOR GILBERTO IT 
IS HIS FIRST GOAL SINCE LAST MAY ARRIVING IN SPACE AND THE SHOT DEFLECTED PAST HAHNEMANN GILBERTO WILL CLAIM IT THOUGH IT 
CAME OFF BIKEY AND FLEW PAST THE 
GOALKEEPER GOOD STUFF FROM ARSENAL AGAIN ARSENE WENGER HAS CONCEDED THAT 
WHEN IT REALLY MATTERS AND ARSENAL 
HAVE BEEN UNDER PRESSURE THEY HAVE 
LOST FLUENCY THERE WAS FLUENCY 
ABOUT THAT MOVE VAN PERSIE SHOULD 
HAVE CONVERTED HE IS UNHAPPY AT THE CHALLENGE 
HLEB STRUCK OUT AT MURTY HAD THE 
REFEREE SEEN IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
A RED CARD OFFENCE YOU CAN SEE 
WHAT GRAEME MURTY THINKS IT WAS 
PUNCH I DO NOT THINK IT WAS 
PUNCH I THINK IT WAS MORE OF A 
SLAP SONKO WAS THE OFFENDER YELLOW CARD ROCKET PROPELLED SPURT OF PACE OH SO UNLUCKY LOOKING FOR HIS FIRST GOAL HERE SINCE OCTOBER SPLENDID EFFORT HIT THE ANGLE OF CROSSBAR AND POST AND STAYED OUT WALCOTT HIT THE WOODWORK AGAIN PERSISTENCE HERE FROM CESC FABREGAS HE THOUGHT WALCOTT WAS OFFSIDE THE WOODWORK HAS SAVED READING FIVE TIMES IN TWO GAMES NOW THAT WAS READING'S BEST EFFORT OF THE GAME SAVED BY LEHMANN WRIGGLED HIS WAY THROUGH SPIRITED NONCHALANCT SAVE IN THE END BY LEHMANN THAT WOULD NOT HAVE COUNTED READING'S BEST FOOTBALL OF THE DAY 
THIS I THINK ROSENIOR WAS ONSIDE 
WHEN THE BALL CAME THROUGH ARSENAL 
WERE A BIT FORTUNATE OFF THE LINE FABREGAS JUST TOO FAR AWAY FROM EBOUE READING OVER THE NEXT THREE GAMES NEED MORE COMMITMENT LIKE THAT 
TODAY I WAS LOOKING FOR A 
PERFORMANCE I SAID BEFOREHAND IT 
WOULD NOT BREAK OUR SEASON BUT IT 
COULD REALISTICALLY MAKE WHEN THEY 
SCORED THE FIRST GOAL IT WAS 
ALWAYS GOING 
TO BE HUGE MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB 
WE HAVE RECENTLY PLAYED 
VERY WELL BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO US 
IN MANY GAMES WE WERE LEADING ONE TO ZERO 
AWAY FROM HOME IN THE BIG GAMES 
WHERE YOU LEAD ONE TO ZERO AWAY FROM HOME 
WE WERE NOT SOLID ENOUGH IT WAS A 
LACK OF CONFIDENCE BUT OVERALL 
TODAY WE HAVE SHOWN A KIND OF 
QUALITY WE CAN BRING UP 
IT IS A THIRTY EIGHT 
GAME SEASON WE HAVE STILL GOT A 
LONG WAY TO GO IT DOES NOT SEEM 
LIKE IT THREE GAMES BUT NINE 
POINTS ARE SIGNIFICANT WE HAVE TO 
TARGET THOSE NINE POINTS AND BE 
GENUINE IN OUR ATTEMPTS THE MARGIN 
IS TINY ISN'T IT 
YEAH WE FEEL WE 
COULD HAVE A LOT OF REGRETS BUT IT 
IS PART OF LIFE TO LOSE SOME TIMES 
MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENTS AND 
SOMETIMES UNDESERVED 
DISAPPOINTMENTS TO BOUNCE BACK WE 
ARE STRONG 
A LOT OF PEOPLE PUT US 
NOT IN THE FOURTH POSITION WE HAVE 
LEARNED A LOT OF THINGS SO NEXT 
SEASON WE WILL BE STRONGER THAN 
EVER 
WE HAVE SHOWN LAST YEAR AND EVER THIS YEAR TO AN EXTENT THAT WE CAN 
BE COMPETITIVE IN THIS DIVISION 
WHICH IS GREAT FOR ANY OF THE CLUBS 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN THE LOWER 
DIVISIONS KNOWING THE PROSPECT OF 
PLAYING AT THE TOP IS THERE FOR 
THEM 
SPEEDS UP THE AGEING PROCESS THEM THOUGH 
ARE YOU SAYING I AM LOOKING THOUGH SEVENTY 
NOT A DAY OVER SIXTY EIGHT IT WILL NOT HELP 
THAT THEY HAVE NOT SCORED IN FOUR 
GAMES THEY ARE NOT LOOKING SECURE 
IT IS LOOKING MORE DIRE THAT THAT RESULT AGAINST FULHAM LAST WEEK WAS 
A BAD RESULT FOR THEM ARSENAL 
PLAYED WELL TODAY THE PRESSURE WAS 
OFF NO GREAT EXPECTATION ON THEM 
ANY MORE HE MADE LOTS OF CHANGES 
STEVE COPPELL GOING INTO TODAY'S 
GAME HE HAS TRIED TO MAKE THEM 
BETTER DEFENSIVELY BUT IT DID NOT 
HAPPEN THEY MADE SOME STRANGE 
DEFENSIVE DECISIONS THEY MADE IT 
EASY FOR ARSENAL I THOUGHT THEY WERE NOT IN A BAD POSITION 
HERE YOU ARE THINKING HOW WILL 
ARSENAL FASHION A CHANCE AND THEN 
SCORE FROM HERE IT WAS AN OBVIOUS MISTAKE ADEBAYOR 
PLAYED THROUGH SO YOU ARE CHASING 
THE GAME STRAIGHT AWAY ONE BALL 
BEATS SEVEN YOU ARE TRYING TO GET 
THEM ALL TOGETHER AND FABREGAS 
COULD NOT RUN AWAY FROM THE 
DEFENDERS TO RETRIEVE THE SITUATION WE KNOW ARSENAL ARE A GOOD SIDE 
THEY HAVE SOME VERY CAPABLE PEOPLE 
CARRYING THE BALL BUT IN THE END IT IS BLOCKED AND 
SCRAMBLED AWAY BY MARCUS HAHNEMANN 
THIS WAS FANTASTIC THE FREE KICK MARCUS HAHNEMANN WHEN THE BALL GOES 
PAST HIM HE HAS HIS MOUTH OPEN 
LIKE A BUS IS ABOUT TO COME PAST 
AND HE CANNOT BELIEVE IT HAS NOT 
GONE IN ARSENAL PLAYED WELL BUT 
READING DID NOT 
THERE WAS AN 
UNSAVOURY INCIDENT WITH HLEB HE HE WAS LUCKY CONSIDERING ONE OF THE 
THINGS WE HAVE SEEN HE WAS RUNNING 
HERE WITH MURTY HE DOES SLAP HIM 
YOU CAN SEE WHAT GRAEME MURTY 
THINKS WHEN HE GETS UP HE IS VERY 
FORTUNATE HE DOES NOT GET AT LEAST 
A YELLOW THIS SEASON WE HAVE SEEN 
WITH MASCHERANO AND ALIADIERE A 
LITTLE TOUCH SLAPS HIM AND GETS A 
STRAIGHT RED FOR THAT WITH THE 
APPEAL HE GETS FOUR L. THINK THE 
REFEREE MIGHT LOOK AT THE HLEB 
INCIDENT 
WHEN SPURS BEAT WIGAN FOUR TO ZERO IN 
NOVEMBER THEY WERE MANAGERLESS AND 
IN THE BOTTOM THREE STEVE BRUCE 
CAME IN AND NOW WIGAN FIND 
THEMSELVES WELL CLEAR OF THE 
RELEGATION ZONE BUT THEY CANNOT 
RELAX YET UNLIKE TOTTENHAM WHO 
ARE MID TABLE AND HAVE TROPHY IN THE CABINET STEVE BRUCE'S APPOINTMENT HAS 
TRANSFORMED WIGAN FROM A TEAM WHO 
LOOKED AS DOOMED AS DERBY TO WAIT 
IN THERE WITH ONE MORE WIN WILL 
LOOK AS SAFE AS HOUSES CHIMBONDA 
AND WOODGATE I INJURED SO ZOKORA 
ANDO HARA LINE UP IN DEFENCE 
ROBBIE KEANE HAS NEVER PLAYED ON 
THIS GROUND WITHOUT SCORING TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR IN YELLOW FROM 
LEFT TO RIGHT IN EUROPE AND IN 
MID TABLE INSIDE THE FIRST FIFTEEN 
SECONDS ROBBIE KEANE GETS HIS 
FIRST SIGHT OF GOAL A COMFORTABLE 
ENOUGH SAVE FOR CHRIS KIRKLAND IN 
THE END KEANE IS ACCUSTOMED TO 
SCORING ON THIS GROUND AARON LENNON'S CROSS TURNED IN BY 
BERBATOV TOTTENHAM ARE IN FRONT 
AFTER FIVE MINUTES AND WHO ELSE 
DIMITAR BERBATOV THE MOVE STARTED 
WITH WONDERFUL BALL FROM 
HUDDLESTONE PERFECT WEIGHT ON IT 
TO PICK OUT AARON LENNON IT JUST 
SKIMMED OFF SCHARNER'S ED INTO THE 
PATH OF BERBATOV WHO CANNOT MISS KIRKHAM SAVES WIGAN IF LENNON HAD 
SCORED WILL SET UP A SECOND FOR 
TOTTENHAM THERE IT MAY WELL HAVE 
BEEN GAME OVER WITHIN THE FIRST 
SEVEN MINUTES THAT IS NOT WHAT HE 
WANTED HESKEY ON THE TURN HESKEY ONE TO ONE ELEVEN MINUTES PLAYED AND IT IS ONE A 
PIECE ALREADY EMILE HESKEY HAS GOT 
AS MANY GOALS THIS WEEK AS HE HAS 
SCORED IN THE WHOLE OF THE REST OF 
THE SEASON HUTTON FOULED BY KILBANE WIGAN 
HAVE DRAWN EVERYONE BACK TO DEFEND 
THIS FREE KICK BERBATOV WENT OVER INSIDE THE 
PENALTY AREA UNDER PRESSURE FROM 
OUR CARR THE REFEREE IS 
UNIMPRESSED MALACHY ART HAD HIS 
HANDS ON THE SHOULDERS OF BERBATOV 
WHO HAD EVERY RIGHT TO GO TO GROUND 
FOR ME THAT IS PENALTY GOOD SAVE BY KIRKLAND WHAT A GOOD 
STOP A TERRIFIC RUN BY AARON 
LENNON IF YOU HAD TO MAKE A 
CRITICISM OF HIS GAME IT MIGHT BE 
THAT HIS GOALSCORING RATIO IS NOT 
GREAT FOR AN ATTACKING PLAYER A 
VERY GOOD SAVE FROM KIRKLAND 
THOUGH MARCUS BENT HAS HIT THE BAR WHAT 
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WIGAN TO TAKE 
THE LEAD LOVELY BALL FROM PALACIOS BENT HIS 
THROUGH THE UNDERSIDE OF THE BAR 
A GREAT GREAT CHANCE NOT QUITE AS GOOD A CHANCE AS 
MARCUS BENT AT THE OTHER END BUT 
NOT TOO FAR OFF AND JENAS LOST HIS 
COMPOSURE AT THE CRUCIAL MOMENT WE 
WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIS SIDE WON IT 
BUT HE WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY 
DISTRAUGHT IF THEY LOST IT HESKEY COULD NOT QUITE FORCE IT 
OVER THE LINE SO CLOSE WIGAN 
VALENCIA GOT THE BETTER OF O'HARA 
HESKEY COULD NOT FORCE IT OVER THE 
GOALKEEPER TWO GOOD SAVES FIRST 
WITH HIS RIGHT HAND AND THEN WITH 
HIS NAVE 
EIGHT MINUTES INTO THE GAME YOU 
COULD HAVE BEEN THREE DOWN 
TYPICALLY WE WEATHERED THE STORM 
AND THE GOALKEEPER PRODUCED A 
COUPLE OF SAVES IN THE SECOND HALF 
WE HAD THE OUTSTANDING CHANCE AND A 
HALF TO GET THREE POINTS BUT IT 
WAS NOT TO BE A POINT IS WELL 
DESERVED 
IT 
WAS ENTERTAINING IT DESERVED WAS GOOD UNFORTUNATELY WE DID NOT 
WIN WE PLAYED FOR NINETY MINUTES TO 
WIN THE GAME BUT WE HAVE TO BE 
PLEASED WITH THE PERFORMANCE THERE THERE IS A CROSSBAR WHICH IS STILL 
RATTLING AFTER MARCUS BENT'S SHOT 
AN INCH MAKES HUGE DIFFERENCE IT 
WAS THAT OUR DAY TO DAY IN THAT 
RESPECT BUT IT IS DECENT POINT 
AGAINST A VERY DECENT START NINETEEN WITH 
SOME EXCEPTIONAL PLAYERS 
DECENT TOTTENHAM TEAM 
DO YOU FEEL 
BERBATOV COULD HAVE HAD A PENALTY 
I DID NOT SEE IT ON THE SCREEN BUT 
FROM THE BENCH IF THAT HAPPENED IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK IT IS A 
FOUL IN THE BOX IT IS A BIG 
DECISION WE DO NOT COMPLAIN 
SOMETIMES IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE 
REFEREE 
THE EQUALISER CAME AT A REFEREE GOOD TIME 
A GOOD TIME FOR US BUT 
YOU WANT THEM TO SEE IF YOU CAN GET 
THE THREE POINTS OUR HOME FORM HAS 
BEEN VERY GOOD THE POINT MIGHT BE 
ENOUGH IF WE BEAT READING NEXT 
WEEK WE ARE SAVED THAT IS A 
WONDERFUL POSITION TO BE IN 
CONSIDERING WHERE WE WERE A FEW 
MONTHS AGO WE WERE THE WHIPPING 
BOYS NEARLY CAST ADRIFT LIKE DERBY 
THANKFULLY WE HAVE RESPONDED 
TERRIFICALLY WELL AND GIVE 
OURSELVES A CHANCE 
YES HE HAS TURNED THINGS AROUND 
WELL ANOTHER VITAL POINT WHAT DID 
YOU THINK OF THE PENALTY 
GUS POYET 
SAID HE PROBABLY THOUGHT IT WAS A 
PENALTY I THOUGHT IT WAS CAST 
IRON 
I DO NOT KNOW HOW HE DID NOT GIVE 
THIS TWO HANDS ON HIM WHEN WE 
HAVE IT FROM A CLOSER ANGLE YOU 
CAN SEE WHY BERBATOV IS SO UPSET 
LOOK AT HIM PULLING HIM BACK 
CLIPS HIS OWN HEELS BUT HE HAS GOT 
TWO HANDS ON HIM THIS WOULD HAVE 
MADE WIGAN SAVE A VERY GOOD FIRST 
TOUCH BUT I'M SURE THAT YOU MIGHT 
HAVE HAD A BIT OF FINESSE ON THAT 
I HAVE STUCK WITH MARK HIS BENTLEY 
AND ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT GOING THE 
BAR IS PROBABLY STILL RATTLING IT 
WAS A GOOD STRIKE UNLUCKY NOT TO 
SCORE THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM A 
SAFETY 
THEY SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT L. SAFETY I THINK THEY WILL BE ALL RIGHT YOU YOU KNOW A WEEK HOW WE HAVE GOAL OF THE 
SEASON I HAVE SEEN AN UNBELIEVABLE 
TACKLE THE DAY 
IT WAS VICIOUS IT IT IS SENSATIONAL HE WILL NOT SEE A 
BETTER ONE ALL SEASON HAVE A LOOK 
AT THIS WHAT HAS POSSIBLY 
HAPPENED 
BEATEN BY A PACKET OF CRISPS JUST 
BRILLIANT THE REFEREE WAS IN A 
FANTASTIC POSITION SALT AND 
LINEKER TERRIBLE 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
BOTTOM OF THE TABLE 
BOLTON HAVE 
GIVEN THEMSELVES A BRILLIANT CHANCE 
THE CONFIDENCE THAT WILL GIVE THEM 
IT IS SURELY BETWEEN THOSE FIVE I 
CANNOT SEE SUNDERLAND AND 
MIDDLESBROUGH AT GETTING INTO IT 
THAT WILL BE THE END FOR FULHAM 
BIRMINGHAM ARE ASTON VILLA TOMORROW 
THE PROBLEM FOR READING WHO WE 
HAVE SEEN BEATEN TODAY IS THEY 
HAVE THE WORST GOAL DIFFERENCE 
APART FROM DERBY AS WE HAVE SAID 
ABOUT MANCHESTER UNITED AND CHELSEA 
THEY HAVE BEEN TWISTS AND TURNS 
AND I THINK THAT WILL BE THE WAY 
WITH THE RELEGATION RUN IN L. THINK THEY HAVE ENOUGH POINTS IN THE BACK WE WILL SEE OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS 
OUR FINAL GAME SAW TANNED FACE TWENTIETH 
WEST HAM AFTER LAST SEASON'S GREAT 
ESCAPE WERE HAPPY WITH MID TABLE 
OBSCURITY WHILE DERBY PROBABLY 
JUST WANTED THE SEASON OVER WOULD 
OVER WITH FREDDIE SEARS MAKES HIS FIRST START 
FOR WEST HAM NINETEEN YEAR OLD JAMES 
TOMKINS COMES INTO THE DEFENCE ROY 
CARROLL RETURNS TO ONE OF HIS 
FORMER CLUBS HOPING THIS WEEK TO 
KEEP THE TEAM IN CLARET AND BLUE AT 
BAY HAVING CONCEDED SIX AGAINST 
ASTON VILLA LAST WEEKEND FOUL WEST HAM WITH THE FREE KICK 
AND A LITTLE BIT OF A TALKING TO 
FOR ALAN STUBBS FROM THE REFEREE 
STEVE TANNER DERBY COUNTY ARE THE 
ONLY SIDE IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
WITHOUT AN AWAY WIN THIS SEASON 
WHAT CAN WEST HAM DO FROM THIS IN 
TOWARDS AS A MORA BOBBY ZAMORA 
GETS HIS FIRST OF THE SEASON WELL 
IT IS AN EASY HEADER IT IS AWAY 
FROM LEACOCK AND CHALLENGED AND 
CARROLL ALMOST RESIGNED TO THE FACT 
THAT THE BALL WAS GOING TO GO PAST 
HIM PLENTY OF OPTIONS FOR MARK NOBLE 
BOBBY ZAMORA IS OFFSIDE HE MAY 
VERY WELL FEEL THAT HE SHOULD HAVE 
GOT A SECOND HERE BUT THE MOMENT 
THE BALL IS PLAYED FORWARD HE 
LOOKS ON SIDE IT WAS SAVAGE WITH THE HEADER THAT IS JUST TIPPED OVER BY ROBERT GREEN MEARS WAS DEFINITELY ONSIDE AND 
WHAT A GOOD SAVE THAT IS FROM 
ROBERT GREEN HE CAME OUT TO 
SMOTHER THE SHOT FROM TYRONE MEARS JUST TOO HIGH FROM TOMKINS ZAMORA COULD NOT GET THERE EITHER IT IS MEARS AND IT IS ONE TO ONE IT IS 
ONLY DERBY'S SEVENTH GOAL AWAY FROM 
PRIDE PARK IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
THIS SEASON AND TYRONE MEARS THE 
FORMER WEST HAM MAN WHO FAILED HE 
HAD A POINT TO PROVE ON HIS RETURN 
TO UPTON PARK AS MOST DEFINITELY 
DONE EXACTLY THAT WHO FELT HE 
HAD A POINT TO PROVE THEY HAVE NOT 
HAD MUCH TO SMILE ABOUT THIS SEASON 
BUT THAT IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS 
NOW ALL AROUND UPTON PARK THERE IS 
NICE THERE IS NOISE LOVELY RUN INTO THE MIDDLE FROM 
NOBLE HE GOT AWAY FROM HIS MARKER 
WEST HAM HAVE TAKEN JUST FOUR 
POINTS FROM THEIR LAST SIX MATCHES 
IS THIS GOING TO BE JUST ONE POINT 
AGAINST ALREADY RELEGATED DERBY LJUNGBERG THROUGH NO FOUL BY ROBBIE SAVAGE CARLTON COLE PUTS IT IN FOR WEST 
HAM WHAT WELL CONSTRUCTED GOAL 
THAT WAS GREAT INTERPLAY BETWEEN 
NOBLE AND LJUNGBERG THE BALL FIRED 
ACROSS GOAL BY THE SWEDISH 
INTERNATIONAL AND CARLTON COLE 
REALLY COULD NOT MISS SAVAGE WITH THE HEADER PANTSIL 
ALMOST UNAWARE THAT HE WAS THERE 
THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT CHANCE FOR 
DERBY TO TAKE HOME POINT 
AT ONE TO ONE WE COULD HAVE GONE ON TO 
WIN THE GAME WE MADE A POSITIVE 
SUBSTITUTION BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE 
WERE UNDONE BY A LITTLE BIT OF 
SKILL FROM LJUNGBERG AND DESPITE 
GOOD OPPORTUNITIES WE COULD NOT GET 
A SECOND GOAL 
I WILL LOOK BACK ON 
THIS SEASON AS A SUCCESS THE 
PROBLEMS WE HAVE BEEN BESET WITH 
JUST SUMS UP THIS WEEK YOU CAN SEE 
THIS WEEK THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE HAD 
SO I WOULD LIKE TO CALL FOR A 
LITTLE BIT OF APPRECIATION AND 
REALISM 
WHAT HAS KEPT ME GOING IS REALISM THE SUPPORTERS AGAIN A SELL OUT 
TODAY NOTHING BUT BACKING THE TEAM 
FROM FIRST WHISTLE TO LAST THAT 
GIVES ME HOPE IT HAS BEEN REALLY 
DIFFICULT THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME 
OF MY CAREER L. L. AM SURE FOR THE 
SUPPORTERS AS WELL BUT WHAT WE CAN 
TRY TO DO IS LEARN FROM THIS 
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND GO THROUGH 
WE WILL DUST OURSELVES DOWN AND 
COME OUT FIGHTING NEXT SEASON 
BECAUSE WE ARE EXPECTING TO BE 
SOMEWHERE CLOSE NEXT SEASON 
A MUCH NEEDED WIN FOR WEST HAM BUT 
WHAT A SEASON FOR DERBY 
ALL ALL 
THE TEAMS WHO ARE GONE DOWN SO 
MEEKLY THEY ARE THE WORST 
DEFENSIVELY OF ANYBODY ELSE I HAVE 
EVER SEEN THEY JUST GIVE GOALS 
AWAY FOR FUN AND HAVE DONE THAT 
EVERY SINGLE WEEK 
PAUL JEWELL WILL 
COME OUT AND SAY THAT IN FAIRNESS 
BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU A LOOK AT THE 
BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE 
MANCHESTER UNITED CAN RETAIN THE 
TITLE BY DEFEATING CHELSEA NEXT 
SATURDAY BUT CHELSEA ARE UNBEATEN 
IN EIGHTY HOME LEAGUE GAMES LIVERPOOL 
REALISTICALLY ONLY NEED ONE POINT 
TO SECURE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FOOTBALL 
FULHAM ARE RUNNING OUT OF GAMES TO 
AVOID JOINING DERBY BIRMINGHAM 
DROP INTO THE BOTTOM THREE AHEAD OF 
THE DERBY AT VILLA BUT ONE POINT 
TOMORROW WILL DRAG READING INTO THE 
RELEGATION ZONE 
WELL IT LOOKED LIKE ROQUE HAD 
ROCKED UNITED BUT THEY ARE STILL 
IN CRUZ CONTROL GOODBYE 
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IS STOLEN 
APART FROM ME 
I'M THE BEST SAFE CRACKER THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER PRODUCED 
I AM WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE BOBBY MOORE AND THE BEATLES 
AND ONCE BLOOD RAN THROUGH MY VEINS 
NOW COME ON LET'S DO IT 
THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS ARE OUT OF RETIREMENT 
ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS JOB OR WHAT THAT'S MORE LIKE IT I'LL KILL YOU 
THE MAURICE I KNOW CATCH THEM IF YOU CAN
