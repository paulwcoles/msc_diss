IT'S OFF TO THE TOWER YOU'RE UP AGAINST EACH OTHER 
SABOTAGE THE GAME MY FRIEND BUT DO NOT BLOW YOUR COVER 
I'M WAITING FOR YOU KIDDIES WHO WILL TAKE THE RAP 
ONLY ONE WILL ESCAPE AND THE REST HA HA HA 
NO NO NO AGHH 
OH I WERE HAVING SWEET DREAMS 
ALL HORRID AND CRUEL AND LOTS OF UNFORTUNATES GETTING CAUGHT 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LOT HAVE WOKEN ME UP 
IT MUST MEAN SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN 
DON'T TELL ME ARE YOU HERE TO DO A SURVEY ABOUT WEREWOLVES 
ARE YOU HERE TO DIRTY UP THE WINDOWS 
OH NO IT'S TIME FOR THE NEXT BOBBING CRAFT 
AND NOTHING'S READY OH 
I'VE ONLY BEEN ASLEEP FOR A WEEK 
NOW HANG ON WHERE ARE THEY FROM 
HERE IT IS 
IPSWICH 
THE LAND OF DRAGONS 
BOGS AND NOW SIX LESS WRETCHES 
HERE THEY ARE THE UNFORTUNATES 
SO UP THEM COME ANOTHER BATCH OF UNFORTUNATES 
IF ANY OF THEM AREN'T AFRAID OF HEIGHTS THEY WILL BE AFRAID OF WHAT'S IN THE TOWER 
LOOK AT THAT BATCH OF CAGELINGS THEY GET WORSE EVERY TIME EUGH 
BEN WHO WANTS TO GO INTO SPACE SO HE CAN SPIT ON THE MOON 
DIONNE SHE READS EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN 
THERE'S DERRYN WHO COLLECTS PLUG HOLES 
CLODAGH WHO INVENTED SNEEZING 
ADAM HE'S RELATED TO THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN 
AND FINALLY JODIE HER MIDDLE NAME IS EEK EEK 
THEY'D BETTER START MISBEHAVING OR THEY'LL GET TRAPPED 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME I ONLY CAME HERE FOR A NIGHT'S KIP 
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO BUT I'VE BEEN TRAPPED EVER SINCE 
THE VOICE CAUGHT ME SHE'S A CRUEL MISTRESS 
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS HEAR HER TALKING IN YOUR NOISE HOLE 
SHE'S PROMISED TO LET ME GO 
ONLY IF I HELP HER TRAP AS MANY UNFORTUNATES AS POSSIBLE 
IN THE TOWER 
THIS IS MY WATCH TANK 
FROM HERE I GETS TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON IN THE TOWER 
SIX UNFORTUNATES STARTS HERE AT THE TOP 
AND WORKS THEIR WAY DOWNWARDS 
IF THEY MAKES IT OUT THE BOTTOM 
THEY'RE HOME IN TIME FOR TEA AND SOME COCKROACH CRUMBLE 
BUT IT'S NOT THAT EASY 
TO ESCAPE EACH FLOOR THEY HAVE TO COMPLETE A CHALLENGE TOGETHER 
BUT ONE OF THEM CANNOT BE TRUSTED 
THE SABOTEUR 
TREACHERY THE SABOTEUR'S JOB IS TO MAKE SURE 
THEY ALL FAIL THE CHALLENGE 
THE VOICE CHOOSES A NEW SABOTEUR ON EACH FLOOR 
AND SHE TALKS TO THEM SECRETLY USING THE WHISPER CLIP 
A CUNNING LITTLE DEVICE THAT GOES RIGHT INSIDE THEIR NOISE HOLE 
WHICH MEANS THAT SHE CAN BE MURMURING HELPFUL STINKY TIPS TO THEM WITHOUT THE OTHERS HEARING 
IF THE TEAM SUCCEED THE SABOTEUR WILL BE TRAPPED ON THAT FLOOR 
IF THE TEAM FAIL IT COULD BE ANY ONE OF THEM 
IN THE END ONLY ONE WILL ESCAPE 
THE REST WILL BE TRAPPED 
FLOOR SIX GOBLET OF ICE 
SOMEONE'S GETTING FROZEN OUT 
IT'S ALWAYS A CHILLING RECEPTION FOR THE UNFORTUNATES 
ONE OF THEM WILL BE FROZEN HERE AND THEIR CHANCE OF FREEDOM TURNED TO SLUSH 
TO SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE HERE'S WILEY SNEAK 
AN UNFORTUNATE TRAPPED ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
IN THIS CHALLENGE 
UNFORTUNATES MUST CARRY SNOW ACROSS THE ICY STEPPING STONES 
AND FILL THE GOBLET OF ICE 
BUT IT'S NOT THAT EASY 
THE STONES ARE DEADLY SLIPPERY AND THERE'S A MONSTROUS GALE BLOWING 
IT'S WINDIER THAN A PLATEFUL OF BAKED BEANS 
WHAT'S MORE IF SO MUCH AS A TOE SLIPS OFF THEM STEPPING STONES 
THE GOBLET WILL TIP UP AND EMPTY OUT ALL THE SNOW THEY'VE COLLECTED 
SO THEY'LL HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN HA HA HA 
REMEMBER NOT EVERYONE WILL BE TRYING TO WIN 
ON EACH FLOOR THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE WHO CAN'T BE TRUSTED 
SO WHO IS IT THIS TIME 
DON'T LOOK AT ME IT'S UP TO THE VOICE 
IT'S TIME TO PICK THE SABOTEUR 
DIONNE DO NOT REACT 
YOU ARE THE SABOTEUR AND YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN HEAR MY VOICE 
YOU MUST MAKE SURE THE GOBLET OF ICE IS NOT FULL BY THE END OF THE CHALLENGE 
THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU CAN DO THIS 
INCLUDING STALLING TIME SPILLING SNOW AND REMEMBER 
TREADING ON THE GROUND TRIGGERS THE TIPPING GOBLET 
I WILL CONTINUE TO GUIDE YOU THROUGH YOUR WHISPER CLIP 
CAN DIONNE MAKE THE OTHERS LOSE SO SHE CAN WIN 
UNFORTUNATES THIS IS GOBLET OF ICE 
TO PASS YOU MUST FILL THE GOBLET YOU HAVE NINETY SECONDS TO DO IT 
AS YOU CAN SEE DIONNE IT'S NOT AN EASY TASK 
THAT WIND IS STRONG HA HA REMEMBER IF YOU TOUCH THE FLOOR THE GOBLET WILL TIP 
THEY'RE WORKING TOO WELL AS A TEAM YOU MUST DO SOMETHING 
SIXTY SECONDS 
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT YOU MUST STRIKE 
DIONNE REMEMBER EVERY TIME SOMEONE TOUCHES THE FLOOR THE GOBLET WILL EMPTY 
EXCELLENT JODIE HAS FALLEN FROM THE ICE STEPS 
NOW SHE LOOKS LIKE THE SABOTEUR 
BRILLIANT DIONNE YOU MADE THAT LOOK LIKE A MISTAKE 
NO ONE'S TOUCHING THE FLOOR 
DERRYN IS CONFUSED THEY DON'T KNOW WHO'S DOING IT 
THIRTY SECONDS BE CAREFUL DIONNE DON'T BE TOO OBVIOUS 
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE TEAM FAIL AND YOU MUST REMAIN UNDETECTED 
NO ONE'S TOUCHING THE FLOOR ARE THEY 
DIONNE THEY'RE DOING TOO WELL 
TEN 
NINE EIGHT 
TIME IS RUNNING OUT 
EXCELLENT DIONNE YOU'VE DONE IT NOW WELL DONE 
ONE 
YOUR TIME IS UP 
YOU HAVE FAILED MISERABLY 
LOOKS LIKE THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN SABOTAGED 
BUT HAS THE SABOTEUR BEEN SEEN 
YOU MUST NOW VOTE FOR WHO YOU THINK THE SABOTEUR IS 
BEN WHO DO YOU THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS AND WHY 
I THINK IT WAS DERRYN COS HE SAID WE WEREN'T TOUCHING THE FLOOR WHEN THE GOBLET TIPPED 
DIONNE I THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS JODIE 
SHE KEPT PUTTING HER FOOT ON THE FLOOR AND IT DIDN'T SEEM BY ACCIDENT 
DERRYN I THINK IT WAS JODIE BECAUSE WHEN SHE PASSED ME THE SNOW 
SHE HAD HER BOWL REALLY HIGH UP AND IT KEPT BLOWING EVERYWHERE 
CLODAGH I THINK IT WAS DIONNE 
BECAUSE DIONNE TOUCHED THE FLOOR TWICE ADAM 
I THINK IT WAS DERRYN COS IT KEPT TIPPING OUT OF HIS BOWL 
JODIE I THINK IT WAS DIONNE BECAUSE SHE KEPT STEPPING ON THE FLOOR 
YOU VOTED FOR DIONNE DERRYN AND JODIE 
AH IT'S A DRAW WHAT TO DO 
GET OUT THE DRAW STRAWS 
WHOEVER DRAWS THE SHORT STRAW WILL BE TRAPPED 
DERRYN YOU HAVE DRAWN THE SHORT STRAW AND WILL THEREFORE BE THE UNLUCKY ONE 
OH THAT WAS SO TENSE MY EYES HAVE SWAPPED ROUND LOOK 
THE SABOTEUR WAS IN FACT 
DIONNE 
DERRYN YOU WILL NOT BE LEAVING THIS ROOM 
THE OTHERS ARE FREE TO PASS TO THE NEXT FLOOR 
DERRYN WHY DO YOU THINK THE OTHERS VOTED FOR YOU 
COS I'M LITTLE SO WHEN I POURED THE SNOW INTO THE GOBLET 
I KEPT SPILLING MOST OF THE SNOW 
BUT I REALLY FEEL UPSET BECAUSE IT WASN'T ME IT WAS DIONNE 
BUT IF I LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE IT WAS REALLY COOL BEING HERE 
AND VERY VERY COLD 
POOR UNFORTUNATE DERRYN 
YOU'RE TRAPPED 
EVERY FLOOR WE TRAP ONE MORE 
NOW DERRYN'S GOT THE SHORTEST STRAW 
FLOOR FIVE DEADLY MEDLEY 
THIS NEXT FLOOR IS BORIS'S LAIR 
HE LIKES A NAP MORE THAN I LIKES TRAPPING UNFORTUNATES 
MEET BORIS THE ORGANIST 
HE'S BEEN TRAPPED HERE FOR YEARS IN THIS CHALLENGE THE UNFORTUNATES HAVE TO MAKE WORDS 
USING THESE MUSICAL NOTES 
ONCE THEY'VE THOUGHT OF A WORD THEY MUST PLACE THE LETTERS ON HIS MUSIC STAND 
FOR BORIS TO PLAY BORIS WILL LIKE SOME WORDS AND NOT LIKE OTHERS 
TO PASS THE CHALLENGE UNFORTUNATES MUST SPELL THREE WORDS BORIS LIKES 
IF THEY SPELL THREE WORDS HE DOES NOT LIKE THEY WILL FAIL 
REMEMBER ONE OF THEM CANNOT BE TRUSTED 
BUT WHO IS IT 
CLODAGH DO NOT REACT 
YOU ARE THE SABOTEUR 
WHAT THE TEAM DO NOT KNOW 
IS THAT BORIS DOES NOT LIKE ANY WORDS WITH THE LETTER D. IN THEM 
SO YOU SHOULD TRY TO USE THIS LETTER AS MUCH AS YOU CAN 
CLODAGH IS THE NEXT SABOTEUR 
THE VOICE IN HER WHISPER CLIP WILL HELP HER WITH STINKY TIPS 
SO SHE CAN SABOTAGE THE CHALLENGE 
UNFORTUNATES THIS CHALLENGE IS DEADLY MEDLEY 
TO PASS YOU MUST THINK OF THREE WORDS THAT BORIS LIKES 
CLODAGH REMEMBER WORDS WITH A D. IN THEM ARE BAD WORDS THAT WON'T COUNT 
DAD 
DAD 
EXCELLENT DIONNE AND JODIE HAVE SUGGESTED DAD 
BORIS WILL HATE THAT WORD 
EXCELLENT CLODAGH GREAT START 
HE DOESN'T LIKE THAT 
TRY B. TRY BAD 
NOW DIONNE HAS SUGGESTED BAD 
YOU'RE LUCKY THEY'RE PICKING BAD WORDS BUT STILL ONE TO GO 
DOG I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN O. 
NO THERE AIN'T BED B. E. D. 
THIS IS BRILLIANT ALL WE HAVE TO HOPE FOR IS THAT THEY DON'T SUSPECT YOU 
THAT'S IT 
YOU'VE DONE IT 
YOUR TIME IS UP 
YOU HAVE FAILED MISERABLY 
LOOKS LIKE THE SABOTEUR'S DONE IT BUT WERE THEY SPOTTED 
YOU MUST NOW VOTE FOR WHO YOU THINK THE SABOTEUR IS 
DIONNE I THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS CLODAGH 
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T TRY TO JOIN IN AND DIDN'T HAVE NO SUGGESTIONS 
CLODAGH I THOUGHT IT WAS ADAM 
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T REALLY JOIN IN THAT MUCH 
ADAM WHO DO YOU THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS 
I THINK THAT WAS DIONNE BECAUSE SHE WEREN'T BRINGING UP MUCH WORDS 
JODIE I THINK THAT WAS DIONNE BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T COME UP WITH THAT MUCH WORDS 
BEN I THINK IT WAS JODIE 
BECAUSE SHE ALWAYS KEPT ON SAYING WORDS 
THAT I THOUGHT MUST HAVE BEEN BAD WORDS 
YOU HAVE VOTED FOR DIONNE 
THE SABOTEUR WAS IN FACT 
CLODAGH 
BRILLIWEED 
DIONNE YOU WILL NOT BE LEAVING THIS ROOM 
THE OTHERS ARE FREE TO PASS TO THE NEXT FLOOR 
DIONNE HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT BEING TRAPPED

AT THE END OF NINETY SECONDS 
ONCE THE LIGHTS ARE ON THEY MUST HIDE IN THEIR WARDROBE 
AND WAIT SOUNDS EASY DOESN'T IT 
EXCEPT ONE OF THEM WILL BE WORKING AGAINST THE OTHERS 
WHEN A LIGHT IS TURNED OFF IT WILL TRIGGER THE MUSIC 
AND SIGNAL TO THE OTHERS THAT THE SABOTEUR HAS STRUCK

AND WILL THEY HAVE ALL THE LIGHTS ON AT THE END OF NINETY SECONDS

ADAM
