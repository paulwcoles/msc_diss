FUEL DUTY ARE YOU A TOP GEAR MAN 
OR A HOLBY CITY WOMAN DO YOU 
RECOGNISE YOURSELF IF YOU DO THE 
TORIES COULD BE ON TO YOU AFTER 
YOUR VOTE AND AFTER YOUR VOTE 
AND AS NICK CLEGG FACES HIS FIRST 
SET OF ELECTIONS AS LEADERS HOW IS 
HE GOING DOWN ON THE STREETS 
GILES HAS BEEN TO LIVERPOOL L. TOLD 
YOU HE WAS THE LEADER OF A PARTY 
NOT IN THIS COUNTRY SURELY ALL 
OF THAT IN THE NEXT HALF AN HOUR 
WITH US FOR THE DURATION THE LIB 
DEMS SPOKESMAN FOR LISTEN TO THIS 
CHILDREN SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES 
IT'S A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY DAVID 
LAWS WELCOME BACK FIRST UP THE 
OIL COMPANY PROFITS JENNY WAS 
TELLING US ABOUT THE STRIKE AT THE 
OIL REFINERY MAY HAVE COME TO AN 
END BUT TODAYS A ANNOUNCEMENT OF 
VAST PROFITS WON'T HELP METORISTS 
FEEL HAPPY B. P. AND SHELL'S PROFITS 
ARE UP BY FORTY EIGHT PER CENT IN THE CASE OF B. P. 
STANDING AT SEVEN BILLION BETWEEN THE 
TWO OIL GIANTS AND THAT IS JUST IN 
THREE MONTHS SO IT'S AN AN RULE 
RAISE OF TWENTY EIGHT BILLION TODAY ROAD 
HAULIERS AND FLAERMS BE DELIVERING 
A COFFIN TO THE COMMONS IN PROTEST 
ONLY SYMBOLIC THERE ISN'T A BODY 
IN IT DAVID LAWS THE OIL 
COMPANIES WILL SAY THESE PROFITS WE 
ARE MAKING ARE NOTHING DO WITH OUR 
PRICES AT THE FORECOURT BECAUSE WE 
DON'T MAKE MONEY OUT OF THE 
I THINK THE COMPETITION AUTHORITIES 
NEED TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE THAT IS 
THE TEST WHENEVER YOU HAVE 
COMPANY IT WILL MAKE PROFITS THAT 
SOUND VERY BIG THE ISSUE IS WHAT 
IS THE RETURN ON CAPITAL IS THERE 
REALLY A REASON FOR GOVERNMENT TO 
INTERVENE INTERVENE THE PEOPLE OR THE PERSON WHO MAKES 
MOST OUT OF THE OIL PRICES WE PAY 
AT THE PETROL PUMP IS THE PRIME 
MINISTER AND HIS CHANCELLOR THEY 
TAKE BY FAR THE BIGGEST CHUNK AT AL 
TIME WHEN OIL IS NOW HEADING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A 
BARREL IS IT RIGHT TO BE RAISING 
TAXES A WELL DON'T THE MOTORISTS 
NEED A BREAK WE PAY THE VIEST DUTY 
AND HIGHEST VAT IN EUROPE ON OUR 
PETROL PRICES DON'T WE DESERVE AL BREAK 
IF PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE BREAK STEEPLY THE CHANCELLOR MIGHT THINK 
AGAIN THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS A 
DECISION NOT TO GO AHEAD WITH A 
FUEL DUTY INCREASE WILL MAKE VERY 
LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO THE CHANGE IN 
FUEL PRICES WHICH HAVE LARGELY BEEN 
DRIVEN BY GLOBAL FACTORS THE 
CHANCELLOR AND THE PRIME MINISTER 
HAVE A HUGE HOLE IN THE NATIONAL 
ACCOUNTS MASSIVE BORROWING TOTAL 
EVERY POUND OUR VIEWERS SPEND AT 
THE PUMP ABOUT EIGHTY PENCE OF THAT 
GOES TO THE GOVERNMENT 
IT'S A HUGE 
FIGURE 
HUGE AMOUNT WHY NOT CUT IT FIGURE BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE TO RAISE 
TAXES SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE SYSTEM 
WE HAVE REDUCED THE RATE OF PUBLIC 
SPENDING 
YOU HAVE YOU JOINED THE SPENDING GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT ALL THE PARTIES ARE SAYING 
CONSERVATIVES LIB DEM LABOUR WE 
NEED TO SEE A SLOW DOWN IN THE RATE 
OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE NONE OF THEM 
ARE SUGGESTING TAKING MORE MONEY 
FROM THE N. H. S. AND SCHOOLS WE HAVE 
TO BE HONEST SOMETIMES POLITICIAN 
DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS WHEN THINGS 
ARE BEING DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN 
OIL PRICES WE NEED TO BE HONEST 
WE LIKE HONESTY PARTICULARLY 
BECAUSE WE DON'T GET IT OFTEN WE 
ARE GLAD TO HAVE YOU AND WILL SPEAK 
TO YOU LATER IT'S TIME FOR OUR 
DAILY QUIZ THE QUESTION TODAY IS 
RELATED TO OUR GUEST IT'S 
IT'S A REALLY TOUGH ONE TODAY TO 
ENTER GO TO OUR WEBSITE AND CLICK 
ON THE QUIZ THEN AT THE END OF 
THE PROGRAMME DAVID WILL GIVE US 
THE CORRECT ANSWER IF YOU WANT TO 
SEND US YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT TODAY'S 
STORIES YOU KNOW THE ADDRESS 
A BIT YOUNG TO HAVE WRITTEN A 
CLOCKWORK ORANGE 
I WILL GIVE HIM 
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT 
NOW THIS MORNING'S NEWS BREAKS IN 
WESTMINSTER THAT A FORMER LABOUR 
MINISTER KATE HOEY HAS AGREED TO 
ADVICE 
ON SPORT IF HE 
BEATS KEN LIVINGSTONE TO BECOME 
MAYOR OF LONDON IN THE VOTING ON 
THURSDAY MR. JOHNSON APPEARS TO BE 
PLAYING LABOUR AT HIS OWN GIM AND 
PLANNING A GOVERNMENT FOR LONDON OF 
QUOTE ALL THE TALENTS THAT 
HASN'T WORKED OUT ALL THAT WELL FOR 
MR. BROWN WHAT WILL LABOUR CHIEFS 
MAKE OF THIS DAYS AHEAD OF VOTING 
MR. HOEY COMPLAINED IN JANUARY ABOUT 
A LACK OF SCRUTINY OF MR. 
LIVINGSTON'S ADVISORS CULT OF 
SILENCE SHE AND MR. LIVINGSTON ARE 
NOT EXACTLY BEST FRIENDS 
CONSERVATIVE LEADER DAVID CAMERON 
HAS BEEN OUT AND ABOUT TALKING 
ABOUT SURPRISE SURPRISE HIS 
ADMIRATION FOR KATE HOEY 
I THINK 
IT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA L. HAVE 
ALWAYS ADMIRED KATE HOEY AS AN M. P. 
SHE PASSIONATE ABOUT LONDON AND 
SPORT AND YOUNG PEOPLE SHE KNOWS 
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS WE GET THE MOST 
OUT OF THE OLYMPICS IN TERMS OF A 
LEGACY FOR LONDON IF BORIS WINS 
SHE WILL BE A GREAT PART OF THIS 
TEAM AND I AM DELIGHTED SHE HAS 
MADE STEP 
THAT WAS A BIT KURT 
HE JUST WALKED AWAY THANKS SCLPS 
OT OFF HE WENT WITHOUT EVEN A 
SECOND THANK YOU WE WILL LEAVE HIM 
WE ARE JOINED BY LABOUR M. P. ERIC 
GILES WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS IS 
IT DAMAGING FOR HER TO SAY SHE IS 
GOING TO WORK FOR A CONSERVATIVE 
MAYOR 
IT'S PRETTY STRANGE MAYOR SPLIATION IN ELECTION WEEK IT IT ALMOST SPECIALLY IN ELECTION WEEK 
IT SEEKS LIKE SHE IS ANXIOUS TO DO 
DAMAGE TO HER OWN PARTY 
IT SEEMS 
TO ME ABOUT PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS 
MAYBE WITH KEN SHE SEEMS TO BE 
MISSING THE WOOD FOR THE TREES 
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ELECTION AND 
SHE IS DOING THIS DAYS BEFORE IT I I HAVE INTRODUCED MR. JOHNSON TWICE 
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I PUT TO HIM 
AGAIN AND AGAIN ONE OF THE 
QUESTIONS I HAVE PUT TO HIM IS CAN 
YOU TELL US WHO WILL BE RUNNING 
THIS CITY HE WOULD NEVER GIVE ME A 
SING NAME YET HERE HE PRODUCED 
KATE HOEY IT SEEMS TO BE A TORY 
GIMMICK BUT A TORY GIMMICK TO 
WHICH SHE IS SUBSCRIBING 
I THINK THAT IS TRUE WHAT THEY 
HAVE DONE WITH BORIS IS KEEP HIM IN 
THE BACKGROUND I THINK I AM 
SUPPOSED TO CALL HIM MR. BORIS 
JOHNSON 
I JUST LIKE BEING POLITE JOHNSON HE HAS NOT SAID A GREAT DEAL BUT 
HE HAS BEEN KEPT IN THE BACKGROUND 
THEY WANT SOMETHING TO SAY HE HAS 
SOME IDEAS L. THINK KATE HAS JUMPED 
INTO THAT 
SHOULD THE WHIP BE 
WITHDRAWN WITHDRAWN I HOPE THAT JOHNSON WILL NOT WIN 
THE ELECTION L. THINK KEN 
LIVINGSTONE WILL WIN IT THEN IT 
WILL BE ACADEMIC 
I SUPPOSE YOU 
COULD SAY GORDON BROWN MADE AN 
ISSUE OF FORMING AN ADMINISTRATION 
OF ALL THE TALENTS HE BROUGHT IN 
LIBERAL ANDS CONSERVATIVES AND SOME 
NOT POLITICAL PEOPLE WHY CAN'T A 
CANDIDATE FOR THE MAYOR OF LONDON 
DO THE SAME 
THE SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE HERE I 
AGREE WITH THE GENERAL THEME IN 
THIS CASE WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN 
THREE DAYS IT'S HELPING THE TORY 
EFFORT EFFORT SHE HAS PREVIOUS ON THIS SHE 
YOUNG SHE VOTED AGAINST FOX HUNTING 
WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR AN INNER CITY 
M. P. PARTICULARLY A LABOUR ONE SHE 
WAS PART OF THE CAMPAIGN ON THE 
LABOUR BENCHES OF EURO SCEPTICS TO 
HOLD THE GOVERNMENT TO A REFERENDUM 
ON THE LISBON TREATY NOW SHE IS 
GOING TO BE MR. JOHNSON'S SPORTS 
ADVISOR OR SUPREMO IF HE BECOMES 
MAYOR IT'S QUITE A CATALOGUE THERE 
CAN YOU CARRY ON REBELLING LIKE 
THIS AND NOT HAVE THE WHIPS COME 
AND DOVE YOU OVER IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE NIGHT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE 
WHIPS MAKE THESEICIAN DECISIONS 
KATE ACE PERSPECTIVE IS DIFFERENT 
SOMETIMES HER BACKGROUND IS 
REFLECTED IN HER POLITICS 
WHAT DO 
YOU MAKE OF THIS 
I AM AMUSED BY IT 
GORDON WAS DOING THE SAME THING TO 
THE CONSERVATIVE LAST YEAR NOT 
WITH GREAT SUCCESS AS IT TURNED OUT 
HE ACTUALLY AS I SEEM TO REMEMBER 
MANAGED TO POACH ONE OR TWO TORY 
M. P.'S TO TAKE OVER COMMISSIONS JUST 
BEFORE THE ELECTION THAT NEVER WAS 
IN VERY UPPITY POLITICAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES WERE 
THERE WAS GOING TO BE AN ELECTION 
THIS IS IRONIC IT ALSO EXPOSES 
WHAT PEEP FEEL ABOUT BORIS 
JOHNSON'S CAMPAIGN WHICH IS THAT 
THEY ARE NOT SURE WHAT THERE IS IN 
TERM WAS POLICY HE SEEM LIKES A 
PERMIT IN NEED OF ADVICE HE IS A 
NI BRIGHT GUY BUT MANY PEOPLE 
FEEL HE COULD BE DISASTROUS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SURE WHAT HE 
WOULD DO IN POWER 
THE GENERAL 
SITUATION FOR YOUR PARTY ANOTHER 
POLL OUT THIS MORNING LABOUR DOWN 
AT TWENTY SIX PER CENT NOT GREAT NEWS FOR THE LIB 
DEMS AT TWENTY TWO PER CENT 
UP FORTY POINTS 
FROM SEVENTEEN 
IF YOU COUNT THAT AS GOOD THE 
POLLS ARE NOW UNIVERSALLY BAD FOR 
LABOUR LABOUR IT'S DIFFICULT THERE IS NO 
QUESTION ABOUT IT WE ARE AT THE 
BOTTOM OF THE TROUGHTHERE IS GAP 
BETWEEN PUBLIC 
PERCEPTION OF 
WHERE 
THE ECONOMY IS AND WHERE WE ARE IN 
TWO OR THREE MONTH TIME WE WILL 
START TO CLIMB OUT OF IT 
IF YOU DO 
BADLY ON THURSDAY IN THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS IN THE ENGLAND AND WALES 
AND MR. JOHNSON DOES WIN LONDON 
THEN THE TROUGH COULD GET A LITTLE 
DEEPER 
IT WOULD BE DECIDEDLY DEEPER UNCOMFORTABLE IF BOTH OF THOSE 
THINGS HAPPEN 
MORE HONESTY YOU 
ARE HAVING AN EFFECT HERE HONEST 
DAILY POLITICS 
I THINK WE WILL WIN 
IN LONDON WHETHER THE ISSUES WITH 
THE COUNCIL ELECTION AND WE WILL 
CLIMB OUT OF THE TROUGH 
WE SHALL 
SEE WE WILL BE BACK ON FRIDAY WITH 
A SPECIAL DAILY POLITICS ELECTION 
PROGRAMME WE WILL SEE IF YOU ARE 
RIGHT THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US 
TODAY ERIC JOYCE 
THE LOCAL ELECTIONS WILL BE THE 
FIRST MAJOR ELECTORAL TEST FOR NICK 
CLEGG SINGS HE TOOK OVER THE PARTY 
FOUR MONTHS AGO NICK CLEGG LIKE 
GORDON BROWN HASN'T ENJOYED THE 
HONEYMOON HE WOULD HAVE HOPED FOR 
HIS REVELATION HE HAD NOT MORE THAN 
THIRTY LOVERS AS BECOME KNOWN AS THE 
CLEGGOVER AFFAIR HAS IT DAMAGED OR 
ENHANCED THE LIB DEMS IMAGE AHEAD 
OF THE ELECTIONS WE HAVE BEEN TO A 
CITY WHICH HAS BEEN LIBERAL RUN FOR 
A DECADE 
A QUICK TURNAROUND LIVERPOOL AND 
YOU REALISE BEING THE EUROPEAN CITY 
OF CULTURE HAS BROUGHT BIG 
INVESTMENT SO MUCH SO THE PLACE IS 
BEING DUG UP RENOVATED AND REBUILT 
THERE IS SO MANY YELLOW JACKETS 
ABOUT YOU MIGHT BE IN THE MIDST OF 
A YELLOW CONFERENCE AS LIB DEMS 
CONFERENCE APT BECAUSE IT'S 
FIGHTING LABOUR TO KEEP IT IT'S 
FAIR TO SAY THAT THE LIB DEM PLAN 
FOR POWER IS LIKE THE CITY SHE HAVE 
RUN FOR TEN YEARS A WORK IN 
PROGRESS THEY WERE DOING WELL WITH 
CHARLES CLARKE THEN HIS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BOT CHARLES 
KENNEDY THEN HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH 
THE BOTTLE MAENT HE HAD TO GO THEN 
MING WHEN HE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT 
HE WAS TOO OLD AND BOTTLED OUT 
THAT LEAVE US WITH NICK CLEGG THE 
N. U. R. YOUNG LEADERMENT HAS HE BEEN 
ABLE TO REINVIGORATE THING DOES 
ANYONE KNOW WHO HE IS 
IT'S NOT 
CAMERON IS IT NO NO I JUST WANT TO KNOW DO YOU 
RECOGNISE THIS FELLA NO 
IF I SAY NO HE IS A POLITICIAN DOES IT HELP L. 
GUESSED HE WOULD BECAUSE I DON'T 
KNOW HIM 
MICHAEL BALL 
NO 
HE IS CONSERVATIVE HE LOOKS 
LIKE A CONSERVATIVE 
I DON'T THINK 
HE WILL LIKE THAT HE IS NOT A 
CONSERVATIVE BUT YOU ARE IN IN THE 
RIGHT BALL PARK HE A POLITICIAN 
NO IDEA IF I TOLD YOU HE WAS THE 
LEADER OF PARTY 
NOT IN THIS COUNTRY SURELY 
YES IN 
THIS COUNTRY HE HAS BEEN LEADER 
FOR A LITTLE BIT HIS NAME IS NICK 
CLEGG LEADER OF THE 
UKIP OR 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
LIB DEM CLEGG 
SOMEBODY HAS RECOGNISED MR. CLEGG 
YES LIB DEM 
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU 
ARE A MAN WHO WATCHES THE NEWS AND 
KNOWS ABOUT THE WORLD OR BECAUSE 
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN NICK 
CLEGG 
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THE CLEGG LIB DEMS HE IS FAMOUS FOR HOW MANY 
LOVERS HE HAD NOR THE WRONG REASON 
MICHAEL MCCARTNEY 
PAUL MCCARTNEY'S 
BROTHER WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER DO YOU 
RECOGNISE IN THIS CASE THAT FELLA 
YEAH 
THEY COULD CLAIM THE MEDIA OR YEAH VOTER APATTIE FOR THAT BUT THAT 
WOULD DENY A BIGGER PROBLEM I I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE A HIGH ENOUGH 
PROFILE NATIONALLY WE DON'T HAVE A 
REAL OPPOSITION YOU ASK MOST 
PEOPLE WHAT THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
NATIONAL POLICY WAS YOU MIGHT HAVE 
A HARD JOB FINDING OUT 
IT'S A TWO 
PARTY SYSTEM WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO 
GO BEFORE PEOPLE ACCEPT THEM WHAT WHAT HAVE THEY GOT TO OFFER YOU TELL ME 
I DON'T KNOW HAVEN'T A CLUE THEY 
HAVEN'T MADE THEMSELVES KNOWN TO 
WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO TO THE PEOPLE 
IN LIBERAL LIVERPOOL MR. CLEGG IS 
NOT A HOUSEHOLD NAME MAYBE EVEN IN 
HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD THIS SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN THE HONEYMOON PERIOD FOR NICK 
CLEGG HE'S HANDSOME NEW YOUNG 
POLITICIAN COMING TO THE LEERM OF 
YOUR PARTY 
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHOWING GROWTH 
AND MORE IMPORTANCE IN YOUR PARTY 
YET IT'S ALL BEEN A SERIES OF 
COCK UPS 
I DON'T THINK IT HAS BEEN COCK UPS AT ALL IF YOU ARE FAIR TO US AND 
YOU REFLECT UPON THE POSITION WHEN 
NICK TOOK OVER THE PARTY WE WERE 
ON THIRTEEN PER CENT OR FOURTEEN PER CENT IN THE OPINION POLLS 
THE LAST TWO OPINION POLLS WE HAVE 
SEEN TODAY AND OVER THE WEEKEND 
OFFER TWENTY PER CENT IT LOOKS AS IF OUR 
SUPPORT HAS BEEN BUILDING BACK UP 
AFTER THE PROBLEMS WE HAD LAST YEAR 
AFTER THE PROBLEMS WE HAD LAST YEAR WHY HIS PERSONAL RATING ABOUT THE 
SAME AS MENZIES CAMPBELL WAS AT HIS 
WORST 
WE HAVE FOUND WITH LIB DEM WORST LEADERS UNTIL THEY GO THROUGH A 
GENERAL ELECTION THE EXPOSURE THEY 
GET TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IS 
NOT THE SAME AS THE TWO MAIN 
POLITICAL LEADERS 
MING CAMPBELL 
WAS THROUGH A GENERAL ELECTION AND 
HIS RATING WAS REGULARLY BETTER 
THAN NICK CLEGG'S IS NOW 
I'M NOT 
SURE THAT IS TRUE 
IT IS ACTUALLY 
HIS WORST RATING WAS TWENTY FOUR PER CENT MING CAR 
BELL MR. CLEGG'S ONLY TWENTY SIX ONLY TWO 
POINTS HIGHER 
THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR 
UNTIL A LIB DEM LEADER IS THERE FOR 
A WHILE A LOT OF THE PUBLIC WHO 
ARE NOT SO CONSCIOUS OF THEM THAT 
CHANGES WHEN THEY GO THROUGH AN 
ELECTION LOOK AT THE WIDER FIGURES 
OF THE PARTY THEY'VE GONE UP 
SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE NICK TOOK OVER 
WE FIND OURSELVES IN THESE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS COMPETING BOTH IN THE 
NORTH AND THE MIDLANDS WITH LABOUR 
AND ALSO IN THE SOUTH WITH THE 
TORIES THE ONE PARTY THAT SEEMS TO 
BE ABLE TOO COMPETE AND WIN VOTES 
AND WIN SEATS RIGHT ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY COUNTRY IF HE IS DOING SO WELL IN YOUR VIEW 
NOT THE VIEW OF MANY OTHERS BUT IF 
HE IS DOING SO WELL HOW WELL ARE 
YOU GOING TO DO ON THURSDAY WHAT 
WILL YOUR NET GAINS BE YOU WON'T 
WIN LONDON WHAT WILL YOUR NET GAIN 
IN SEATS BE 
I WON'T PREDICT THAT 
I WILL NOT MAKE A PREDICTION YOU YOU ARE PREDICT YOU WILL MAKE A NET 
GAIN 
ARE YOU GOING LET ME HAVE A GAIN WORD IN ANDREW NO 
IT'S VERY NO CLOSE ACROSS LARGE PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY YOU WON'T GET ME IN 
TROUBLE BY MAKING A PREDICTION 
IT'S MY JOB TO GET YOU INTO TROUBLE 
YOU CAN HARDLY CLAIM THAT MR. CLEGG 
IS DOING WELL FOR YOUR PARTY IF YOU 
DON'T EVEN THINK THERE WILL BE A 
SINGLE NET GAIN 
WAIT AND SEE THE 
RESULTS WHAT YOU WILL SEE IN PARTS 
OF THE COUNTRY WHERE LABOUR VOTE IS 
INCREDIBLY WEAK THE LIB DEMS WILL 
BE DOING WELL THEY ARE THE MAIN 
CHALLENGERS TO LABOUR THEY WILL BE 
WINNING SEATS AND HAVING A GOOD 
OUTTURN THE COMPARISON IS TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
WHEN LABOUR WAS INCREDIBLY WEAK AND 
DOING BADLY AFTER THE IRAQ WAR IN 
PARTS OF THE SOUTH AS WELL WHERE 
PEOPLE ARE ALLEGING THAT WE ARE 
SUFFERING IN RELATION TO THE TORIES 
WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IN MANY OF THE 
AREAS WHERE WE ARE STRONG IS THE 
TORIES GETTING SQUEEZED OUT L. 
SPOKE TO COLLEAGUES IN THE SOUTH OF 
THE COUNTRY WHERE THE TORIES YOU YOU WON'T MAKE NET GAINS 
YOU ARE STILL 
NOT GOING GET ME IN TROUBLE BY 
MAKING A PREDICTION THE PARTY HAS 
DONE MUCH BETTER UNDER NICK SINCE 
HE TOOK OVER AS LEADER IT'S THE 
ONLY NATIONAL PARTY IN LOCAL 
ELECTIONS ABLE TO COMPETE ALL OVER 
THE COUNTRY LET'S WAIT AND SEE HOW 
WE DO ON THURSDAY NIGHT BUT I 
EXPECT WE WILL DO WELL 
WHY HAS HE 
BECOME ACCIDENT PRONE THIS 
INTERVIEW ABOUT HIS THIRTY SLEEPING 
PARTNERS THERE'S EVIDENCE HE MAY 
ONCE HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE 
OXFORD UNIVERSITY CONSERVATIVE 
ASSOCIATION 
I THINK THAT IS ASSOCIATION NONSENSE 
HIS RATHER MING CAMPBELL NONSENSE LIKE PERFORMANCE AT PRIME 
MINISTER'S QUESTION TIME 
I DON'T 
THINK THAT IS TRUE HE IS VERY 
CONFIDENT IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH 
FOR A THIRD PARTY LEADER IS VERY 
TOUGH 
IT IS DIFFICULT 
YOU HAVE TOUGH SIX HUNDRED M. P.'S ON THE OTHER BENCHES HOPING 
THINGS WILL GO WRONG I THINK HE'S 
BEEN A GOOD PERFORMER HE IS 
PERCEIVED IN THE PARTY TO BE DOING 
VERY WELL WE'VE GONE UP IN THE 
OPINION POLLS AT A TIME WHEN 
PEOPLE ARE REALLY LOSING CONFIDENCE 
AND PATIENCE IN THE LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT THE ISSUE OVER THE NEXT 
YEAR IS GOING TO BE IF THEY WANT TO 
CHANGE WHAT CHANGE ARE THEY GOING 
TO HAVE THERE WILL BE MORE 
CONCENTRATION ON THE OPPOSITION 
PARTIES 
IN A WORD WHAT IS THE PARTIES DEFINING ISSUE FOR THE LIB DEMS 
TODAY 
THE DEFINING ISSUE IS A TODAY FAIRER BRITAIN BUT A MORE LIBERAL 
BRITAIN PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH 
LABOUR THEY BELIEVE THEY'VE FAILED 
ON THE PUBLIC SERVICES FAILED TO 
DELIVER FAIRNESS BUT I DON'T 
BELIEVE THAT THEY THINK THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE THE ANSWER FOR 
THAT MUCH OF THE CONSERVATIVE 
SUPPORT IS AN ANTI GOVERNMENT VOTE 
I SUSPECT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE 
SCRUTINY ON THE POLICIES OF THE TWO 
OPPOSITION PARTIES 
YOU CAN'T 
CAMPAIGN FOR AN ILLIBERAL BRITAIN 
AN UNFAIRER BRITAIN THE THE CONSERVATIVES DID BEFORE 
WE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE 
EIGHT EIGHT YOUR E. MAILS NIGEL FROM NEWCASTLE 
UPON TYNE SAID NICK CLEGG VISITED 
THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND 
AATTENDED ONE OF HIS SESSIONS AND 
WAS AMAZED HOW OPEN AND HONEST HE 
IS COMPARED TO MOST POLITICIANS 
ON THE SUBJECT OIL PRICES ROGER 
FOUND SAYS IT'S NO USE ASKING A 
POLITICIAN ABOUT THE SKY HIGH PRICE 
OF PETROL THEY'RE SO REMOVED FROM 
THE LIVES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE AND SO 
CUSHIONED BY THE PUBLIC PURSE THEY 
DON'T FEEL THE PAIN GRAHAM STEIN 
SAYS OPEC HAS WARNED THAT CRUDE 
OIL COULD HIT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS BARREL THIS 
IS NOT ON AND MY BUSINESS DEPENDS 
ON MY CAR 
WHAT ABOUT KATE HOEY'S SUPPORT FOR 
BORIS JOHNSON HIS BASIC MESSAGE IS 
GOOD RIDDANCE GIVEN HER DISASTROUS 
INCOMPETENT AND SHORT TENURE AS A 
MINISTER SHE WOULD BE THE PERFECT 
AJUNT TO BUNGLING BORIS 
NOW WE KNOW YOU ARE ALL 
POLITICALLY SWITCHED ON SOME YOU 
MIGHT EVEN HAVE NOTICED THERE ARE 
ELECTIONS HAPPENING THIS WEEK DID 
YOU KNOW THE LENGTHS TO WHICH 
POLITICIANS WILL GO WHEN TRYING TO 
SUSS YOU OUT TO WIN YOUR VOTE 
THEY SPEND THOUSANDS EMPLOYING 
MARKETING GURUS WHO USE A TECHNIQUE 
CALLED MICROTARGETING TO HONE IN ON 
KEY GROUPS OF SWING VOTERS WITH 
THE REPORTS OF THE TORIES HAVE 
IDENTIFIED NEW RANGE OF TARGETS 
INSPIRED BY T. V. PROGRAMMES PROBABLY 
INCLUDING THE DAILY POLITICS 
HERE'S JENNY WITH THE LOWDOWN 
POLITICIANS HAVE ALWAYS HAD VARIOUS 
GROUPS IN THEIR SIGHTS REMEMBER 
MONDEO MAN THE KIND OF MIDDLE 
INCOME HOMEOWNERS THAT LABOUR 
SUCCESSFULLY TARGETED TO WIN OVER 
FROM THE TORIES IN THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
ELECTION WHAT ABOUT WORCESTER 
WOMAN WOMEN IN PROVINCIAL CITIES 
WERE ALSO TARGETED AS CRUCIAL SWING 
VOTERS BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND THEN LAST 
YEAR THE ARCH BLAIRITE STEPHEN 
BYERS URGED LABOUR TO GET DOWN WITH 
THE BACARDI BREEZER GENERATION ONE 
TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS IN DANGER OF BEING 
LOST TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS 
THIS WEEKEND IT WAS REPORTED THAT 
THE TORIES ARE FOCUSING THEIR 
EFFORTS ON FOUR ARC TYPES BASED ON 
REGULAR TELEVISION PROGRAMMES 
THESE INCLUDE HOLBY CITY WOMAN 
SHE'S MIDDLE RANKING HEALTH 
SERVICE WORKER 
THEN TOP GEAR MAN WHO IS ANGRY 
APPARENTLY WITH LABOUR'S PETTY 
BUREAUCRACY BUREAUCRACY AND THEN THE APPRENTICE GENERATION 
YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WHO IS ARE 
COMING TO TERMS WITH POLITICAL AND 
FINANCIAL REALITY 
AND FINALLY LIKE NAME THAT TUNE 
HERE FINALLY THE GRAND DESIGNS 
COUPLE THE YOUNG FAMILY PURSUING 
AN ETHICAL LIFESTYLE DO THE PUBLIC 
RECOGNISE THESE CATEGORIES WE WENT 
OUT ON THE STREETS OF THRON FIND 
OUT 
I'D SAY I'M ATOP GEAR MAN OUT PEOPLE SHOULD BE DONE EFFICIENTLY 
AND QUICKLY 
IF I HAD TO BE PUT 
INTO THOSE BRACKETS I'D PROBABLY 
SAY I'D BE THE ASPIRATIONAL YOUNG 
LATE TWENTY SOMETHING 
THE GRAND 
DESIGNS COUPLE 
I'D LIKE TO SAY 
THAT YEAH 
PROBABLY MORE THE APPRENTICE 
CATEGORY THAN ANYTHING ELSE I'D 
SAY I'D RATHER PROBABLY BE GRAND 
DESIGNS BUYING A HOUSE BUT I'M 
NOT AT THAT STAGE YET 
I WOULDN'T 
DEFINE MYSELF WITH A T. V. PROGRAMME 
AS I'M GETTING MORE NEAR MIDDLE AGE 
I'D LIKE TO BE IN GRAND DESIGNS 
COUPLE NOW I'M THE TOP GEAR MAN 
UNFORTUNATELY UNFORTUNATELY WITH US IS FORMER PRESS SECRETARY 
FOR WILLIAM HAGUE AND IAIN DUNCAN 
SMITH NICK WOOD WELCOME TO THE 
PROGRAMME IT'S WHAT THEY DO IN 
AMERICAN ELECTIONS MICROTARGET 
CERTAIN GROUPS DO YOU THINK THAT 
STRATEGY CAN WORK HERE 
I THINK 
IT'S INEVITABLE THAT POLITICAL 
PARTIES WILL TARGET VOTERS THEY'RE 
IN THE BUSINESS OF WINNING VOTES 
THEY CERTAINLY DO IT IN AMERICA WE 
HAVE DONE IT HERE BEFORE IT LOOKS 
LIKE WE CAN DO IT AGAIN 
ARE WE IN 
DANGER BY HONING IN ON SPECIFIC 
GROUPS OF NEGLECTING THE OVERALL 
MESSAGE THE OVERALL PHILOSOPHY 
WHAT WHAT HAPPENED TO GOOD OLD 
FASHIONED WINNING PEOPLE AROUND 
WITH THE POWER OF YOUR ARGUMENT 
THE THE THING THAT HAS PROBABLY THE CHANGED IN THE OLDEN DAYS PEOPLE 
VOTED VERY MUCH ON CLASS LINES THE 
MIDDLE CLASS VOTED CONSERVATIVE OR 
MAYBE OCCASIONALLY LIB DEM AND 
MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE WHO WORKED IN 
THE PUBLIC SECTOR MIGHT BE MORE 
INCLINED TO VOTE LABOUR THE WORKS 
CLASSES TENDED TO VOTE LABOUR BUT 
THERE WAS ALSO A STRONG WORKING 
CLASS CONSERVATIVE VOTE BUT WE ARE 
NOT TARGETED ALONG CLASS LINES NOW 
THE SUNDAY TIMES AT THE WEEKEND 
ENTERTAINLY DEMONSTRATED THIS 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF 
VOTERS YOUR FILM RATHER SUGGESTED 
THAT PEOPLE DO THINK OF THEMSELVES 
IN TERMS OF THESE TELEVISION 
PROGRAMMES 
IF YOU ARE NOT ONE OF PROGRAMMES THOSE SPECIFIC GROUPS OF VOTERS 
AREN'T YOU GOING TO FEEL SLIGHTLY 
OVERLOOKED AS IF NO ONE'S REALLY 
WORRYING ABOUT YOUR INTERESTS WELL WELL WHO KNOWS THERE MAY BE MORE 
TELEVISION PROGRAMMES THAT DAVID 
CAMERON HAS IN MIND 
IT COULD GO ON AND ON 
GRUMPY OLD 
MEN FOR ONE 
WHY DID YOU GESTURE IN 
THAT DIRECTION THEN 
I WASN'T LOOKING AT ANDREW YOU YOU BETTER WATCH IT 
I WAS THINKING OF 
MYSELF AS MUCH AS ANYONE ELSE YOU 
ARE QUITE RIGHT THERE ARE 
DIFFERENT GROUPS IN SOCIETY WHO 
MAY GET LEFT OUT OF COURSE AN 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN ULTIMATELY HAS 
PLENTY OF MESSAGES PLENTY OF 
ENTERTAINMENT VALUE IF YOU ARE 
INTERESTED 
DO THE LIB DEMS GO IN INTERESTED FOR MICROTARGETING 
WE CERTAINLY 
TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT ISSUES THAT 
ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM WE MIGHT 
KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CARE 
PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND IT MAKES SENSE TO TALK TO THEM 
ABOUT THOSE ISSUES THAN ISSUES THEY 
CARE LESS ABOUT WE DON'T CATEGORY 
PEOPLE BY T. V. PROGRAMMES L. WAS 
STRUGGLING TO THINK WHAT CATEGORY 
I'D PUT ANDREW IN 
GO ON THEN 
ENLIGHTEN US 
PERHAPS THERE IS MORE 
POSSIBLE THAN I HAD THOUGHT EARLY 
ON 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT AN ANSWER ON GRUMPY OLD MAN 
THERE'S SOME 
DANGERS WITH THIS THE OVERALL 
APPROACH THAT POLICY MAY BECOME 
POLICY CAN BECOME TOO FOCUS GROUP 
LED TWO DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP LED 
POLITICAL PARTIES CAN GET INTO THE 
HABIT WHICH IS DEPLORABLE ABOUT 
SAYING ONE GROUP TO ONE GROUP 
SAYING THIS IS OUR POLICY ON THE 
HEALTH SERVICE AND THEY SAY TO ONE 
GROUP WITHIN THE HEALTH S. AND TO A 
CONSUMER OR PATIENT THEY SAY 
SOMETHING ELSE 
WHICH WILL INCREASE 
THE CYNICISM 
IT DOES THE PUBLIC 
IS CAPABLE OF SEEING THROUGH THIS 
SORT OF THING 
WE ASSUME PEOPLE ARE 
NOT INTERESTED IN ISSUES WHICH THEY 
MAY BE INTERESTED IN BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE CHILDREN OR THEY EXPECT TO 
BECOME A PENSIONER L. THINK THAT IS 
ONE THING THAT IS MISSING 
DO YOU 
THINK IT'S LEGITIMATE TO TRY TO 
MARKET POLICIES TO VOTERS RATHER 
LIKE YOU MIGHT MARKET WASHING 
POWDER OR SOMETHING 
YES L. THINK 
THAT IS LEGITIMATE IF YOU TAKE THE 
HOLBY CITY EXAMPLE WHAT THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE DOING IS 
TARGETING THE PRODUCERS OF HEALTH 
CARE THERE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN 
THE SERVICE BUT FOR THE MILLION 
PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE HEALTH 
SERVICE THERE ARE MILLIONS OF 
PEOPLE WHO USE THE HEALTH SERVICE 
ONE THING YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 
IN TERMS OF WHICH POLICY WHO IS 
YOUR TOP PRIORITY IS IT A DOCTOR 
OR NURSE WORKING IN THE HEALTH 
SERVICE IS IT THE PATIENT 
TRADITIONALLY THE POLITICAL 
PARTIES ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE 
CONSUMER
