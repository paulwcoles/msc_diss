HAS BAGS OF CHARACTER WITH ORIGINAL WOODEN BEAMS AND EXPOSED BRICKWORK 
ARE YOU THINKING OF SELLING YOUR HOUSE BUT CAN'T QUITE FACE ALL THE HASSLE 
WELL YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE 
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S TIME FOR OPEN HOUSE 
WHEN IT COMES TO SELLING PROPERTY THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS TO CONSIDER 
BUT ON OPEN HOUSE WE TAKE THE STRESS OUT OF THE PROCESS 
WE'LL ORGANISE A ONE OFF OPEN DAY EVENT AND INVITE LOTS OF INTERESTED BUYERS 
TO PUT IN BIDS ON THAT VERY SAME DAY WHAT COULD BE EASIER 
WELL ALL WE NEED NOW IS A HOUSE 
AND TODAY I'VE COME TO SAINT NEOTS IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE TO USE MY EXPERIENCE 
AS A PROPERTY DEVELOPER TO HELP A COUPLE SELL THEIR HOME 
THE WATERWAYS OF THE GREAT RIVER OUSE PROVIDE A SCENIC BACKDROP TO THE CAFES BARS 
AND OLDE ENGLISH PUBS THAT DOT THE CENTRE OF THIS DESIRABLE MARKET TOWN 
THE GRAND PARISH CHURCH CAN BE SEEN FOR MILES AROUND BUT NOT ALL HOUSING IN SAINT NEOTS IS CENTURIES OLD 
AND WHETHER IT'S MODERN BUILDS OR PERIOD HOMES 
A STEADY STREAM OF FAMILY BUYERS MAKES FOR A VERY BUOYANT PROPERTY MARKET 
AND I'VE HEARD OF A LOVELY LITTLE COTTAGE THAT SHOULD HAVE EAGER BUYERS QUEUING ROUND THE BLOCK TO BUY IT 
AND THE FIRST THINGS I'M SEEING IS WELL MANICURED HEDGES 
LARGE AMOUNT OF PARKING AND THE CURRENT OWNERS ARE INTO CARAVANNING 
BUT BEHIND THIS HUGE PLASTIC BEAST NESTLING BEHIND THE CHERRY TREE IS CHERRY TREE COTTAGE 
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN BEING STUCK BEHIND A CARAVAN 
ON OR OFF THE ROAD AND THIS ONE ROBS THIS PRETTY CHARACTER PROPERTY OF ITS ALL IMPORTANT KERB APPEAL 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE INSIDE 
WELL HOW VERY QUAINT AND CURIOUS 
IT'S NOT A BAD START AND WE'VE GOT A COSY AND COTTAGEY LIVING ROOM IN HERE 
PLENTY OF CHARACTER A BIT KNICK KNACK HEAVY FOR SELLING PURPOSES BUT WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT 
NOW THIS REALLY FEELS LIKE THE HEART OF THE HOME HERE YOU CAN FEEL IT 
IT'S IS A LOVELY DINING KITCHEN SPACE LOVELY FREE FLOWING SPACE INTO THE KITCHEN 
AND WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR WASHING UP YOU'VE GOT 
A LOVELY VANTAGE POINT ACROSS THE GARDEN ALL VERY HOMELY INDEED 
WHAT'S IN HERE IS THIS A CUPBOARD 
NO IT'S ACTUALLY A. 
IT'S THE DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM IT MAY BE THE ONLY BATHROOM 
BUT LET'S SEE WHAT'S UPSTAIRS 
IT'S UP TO ME TO FIND WAYS TO ADD VALUE TO THE PROPERTY 
AND I'VE CERTAINLY GOT SOME IDEAS FOR THE DOWNSTAIRS 
AND UP HERE WE HAVE GOT O. K. WE'VE GOT AN OFFICE HERE 
VERY NICE 
AND A BEDROOM 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A MULTI FUNCTIONING SPACE 
WHICH ISN'T NECESSARILY THE BEST WAY TO PRESENT IT TO POTENTIAL BUYERS' 
WHAT A MARVELLOUS MASTER BEDROOM 
THIS IS REALLY GORGEOUS 
OVERALL LET'S FACE IT THIS IS A REALLY GORGEOUS PROPERTY IN A SUPERB VILLAGE LOCATION 
WHO LIVES HERE AND WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO SELL 
RON AND MARGARET WILLIAMS BOUGHT THE COTTAGE TO DOWNSIZE WHEN THE KIDS FLEW THE NEST 
BUT THEIR PLANS HAVE CHANGED AND NOW THEY WANT TO RAKE IN SOME CASH BY SELLING OFF THEIR HOME SWEET HOME 
ANYBODY WHO IS LOOKING FOR A HOME AND NOT A HOUSE 
THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL GAIN NO MATTER WHAT PRICE THEY PAY 
RON AND MARGARET YOU HAVE AN ADORABLE PROPERTY 
AND IT REALLY FEELS LIKE HOME IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD 
YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR SOME YEARS WE HAVE HOW MANY YEARS WE'VE BEEN HERE JUST OVER TWELVE YEARS 
TWELVE YEARS SO WHY AFTER ALL THIS TIME SELL NOW WE'D LIKE TO GO FOR A BUNGALOW 
WE WOULD LIKE TO MOVE CLOSER TO OUR DAUGHTER AND GRANDCHILDREN WHO LIVE IN GRANTHAM FURTHER UP THE A ONE 
AND IT WOULD RELEASE SOME CASH INVOLVED IN THE BRICKS AND MORTAR 
TO ENABLE US TO PERHAPS GO AND VISIT MY BROTHER IN AUSTRALIA 
SO SUN SEA AND KOALA BEARS THAT SOUNDS GREAT 
IT DOES ALL SOUND SUDDEN TO ME KIND OF A DECISION YOU'VE ONLY MADE IN RECENT TIMES 
YES REALLY OUT OF THE BLUE 
WE'D SEEN A PLOT LOCALLY THAT WE WANTED TO BUILD ON BUT IT WENT TO SOMEBODY ELSE 
SO HAVING LOOKED AROUND WE FELT IF WE WENT A BIT FURTHER NORTH 
WE WOULD GET A BETTER DEAL MORE FOR YOUR MONEY 
MORE FOR YOU MONEY WHO KNOWS IF WE SELL THIS AT A GOOD PRICE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT 
ONE THING YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT EVEN WITH THIS SHORT TIME FRAME 
IS HOW MUCH YOU WOULD LIKE TO SELL THIS HOUSE FOR WHAT WOULD BE THE DREAM PRICE 
WE WOULDN'T GO BELOW TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE O. K. 
I'M GOING TO CHAT WITH YOUR ESTATE AGENT AND LET'S SEE IF THIS IS DOABLE YES 
YES CERTAINLY EXCELLENT I WILL SEE YOU BOTH LATER ON THANKS A LOT BYE BYE MARGARET 
SO THE WILLIAMS WANT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO RELOCATE TO TAKE A TRIP DOWN UNDER 
AND THEY'VE DECIDED TO TRY THE OPEN HOUSE TREATMENT TO RAISE THAT FIGURE FIRST I NEED TO FIND OUT 
IF THEIR AGENT THINKS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND GRAND IS REALISTIC 
HELLO NICKY YOU ALL RIGHT 
NICE TO MEET YOU NICE TO MEET YOU TOO 
I FEEL WE NEED TO CHAT ABOUT RON AND MARGARET'S PROPERTY 
IT'S A GORGEOUS HOUSE THERE'S NO DENYING IT 
WHAT I WANT TO ESTABLISH IS HOW UNIQUE IT IS 
THOSE PROPERTIES WERE BUILT IN NINETEEN THIRTY 
THEY USED THE OLD EATON SOCON CHURCH DOORS FOR THE WOOD AND THE WINDOWS 
SO THEY ARE VERY ORIGINAL THOSE PROPERTIES 
HOW OFTEN DOES A PROPERTY LIKE RON AND MARGARET'S COME ON TO THE MARKET 
THEY DON'T COME ON THE MARKET VERY OFTEN 
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME ONE CAME ON TWELVE YEARS AGO 
WHEN RON AND MARGARET BOUGHT THEIRS ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS VERY SERIOUS 
IS IT ONE OF THOSE AREAS PEOPLE WANT TO MOVE INTO 
IT IS IF YOU TALK TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED IN EATON SOCON ALL THEIR LIVES 
THEY WOULD SAY IT'S THE VILLAGE IT'S THE VILLAGE DON'T YOU KNOW HERE'S THE TRICKY STUFF 
AS A PROFESSIONAL IN THIS AREA KNOWING THE MARKET WHAT IS A REALISTIC MARKETING PRICE 
YOU'RE LOOKING DEFINITELY OFFERS OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
THAT'S GREAT NEWS BECAUSE RON AND MARGARET SAID THEIR DREAM PRICE WOULD BE ANYTHING OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
SO I'LL MAKE SURE THE HOUSE IS LOOKING GORGEOUS AND YOU GET THE BUYERS THROUGH THE DOOR 
COOL I'LL SEE YOU LATER ON 
SO NICKY THINKS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAND IS REALISTIC 
IF SHE CAN FILL THE HOUSE WITH POTENTIAL BUYERS 
AND I CAN STAGE IT PERFECTLY I THINK THAT COULD BE ACHIEVABLE 
FIRST I WANT TO CHECK OUT THE LOCAL MARKET TO BE SURE OF WHERE OUR HOUSE SITS ON THE SAINT NEOTS PROPERTY SCALE 
AT THE TOP OF THE MARKET THIS FOUR BEDROOM MODERN FAMILY HOME 
BOASTS SERIOUS SQUARE FOOTAGE AND PLENTY OF PERIOD FEATURES 
THERE'S A GRAND DINING AREA TO ENJOY A MEAL COOKED IN AN ENORMOUS KITCHEN 
UPSTAIRS THERE ARE FOUR BEDROOMS INCLUDING TWO OF IMPRESSIVE PROPORTIONS 
AND WHEN IT COMES TO OUTDOOR SPACE CHOSE TO ENJOY THIS HUGE GARDEN 
FROM THE COMFORT OF A CONSERVATORY OR ALFRESCO ON THE LOUNGERS 
IT'S ALL YOURS FOR FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE GRAND 
A FEW RUNGS DOWN THE LOCAL PROPERTY LADDER THIS SIXTEEN F. T. CENTURY COTTAGE 
HAS BAGS OF CHARACTER WITH ORIGINAL WOODEN BEAMS AND EXPOSED BRICKWORK 
THERE'S A SMALL COTTAGE KITCHEN WHICH SERVES A VAST DINING ROOM 
THAT WOULDN'T LOOK OUT OF PLACE IN A CASTLE 
UPSTAIRS THERE'S A SIZEABLE SECOND SITTING ROOM PLUS FOUR BEDROOMS 
WHICH RETAIN THE PROPERTY'S ORIGINAL CHARACTER 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
THE WILLIAMS' COTTAGE SITS A LITTLE LOWER DOWN THE LOCAL PROPERTY SCALE 
IN DIRECT COMPETITION IN PRICE TERMS WITH THIS SPLIT LEVEL APARTMENT 
THERE'S A GOOD SIZED LIVING AREA WITH AN IMPRESSIVE PERIOD FIREPLACE 
A SEPARATE DINING ROOM AND A MODEST BUT MODERN KITCHEN 
LIKE RON AND MARGARET'S THERE ARE TWO BEDROOMS BOTH A GOOD SIZE AND WITH AN EN SUITE IN THE MASTER 
AND THE PRICE JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAND 
OUR PROPERTY MORE THAN MEASURES UP AND OUR MARKETING PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IS SPOT ON 
WELL THERE'S OBVIOUSLY STRONG COMPETITION OUT THERE 
BUT WE CAN RISE TO THE CHALLENGE AND PRESENT THE COTTAGE IN A WAY THAT WILL REALLY IMPRESS BUYERS 
RON AND MARGARET WILLIAMS WANT TO SELL THEIR TWO BED COTTAGE IN SAINT NEOTS 
TO MOVE CLOSER TO THEIR GRANDCHILDREN AND VISIT RON'S BROTHER IN AUSTRALIA 
THEY WANT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAND BANG ON THE ESTATE AGENT'S MARKETING PRICE 
AND TO STAND A GOOD CHANCE WE NEED TO STAGE THEIR HOME TO PERFECTION 
RIGHT AS YOU BOTH KNOW WE ARE GOING TO HOLD ONE OF THE BEST OPEN DAYS EVER FACT 
FACT FACT O. K. 
WE NEED TO MARKET THIS PROPERTY SO WHEN ALL THOSE POTENTIAL BUYERS COME THROUGH YOUR FRONT DOOR 
THEY ARE GOING TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS HOUSE LIKE YOU DID THIRTEEN YEARS AGO 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES 
ARE YOU O. K. ABOUT THAT YEAH FINE 
CHANGE NUMBER ONE AS SOON AS WE WALK INTO THE DRIVE YOUR CARAVAN I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE IT DISAPPEAR 
YEAH FINE NO PROBLEM REALLY 
NO PROBLEM AT ALL YOU'RE SO GOOD O. K. WELL THAT'S EASY THEN 
AS SOON AS WE GET INTO THE HOUSE THERE'S A CONSTANT THEME BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN HERE SO MANY YEARS 
IT'S FULL OF MEMORIES AND MEMORABILIA AND BITS AND PIECES 
IT'S VERY HARD SOMETIMES FOR A BUYER WHEN THEY LOOK AT A PROPERTY TO SEE THROUGH THE OWNERS AND SEE THE HOUSE 
WE'VE GOT TURN IT FROM BEING YOUR HOME INTO A SHOW HOME YEAH 
SO IN THE FRONT ROOM I'M THINKING MAYBE OF PUTTING A NEW SOFA IN THERE 
IN HERE CLEARING IT OUT REALLY DEFINE THE SPACES 
MAYBE MORE MINIMAL BLINDS IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
UPSTAIRS THAT OFFICE CUM BEDROOM I WANT TO MAKE THE OFFICE DISAPPEAR 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SELL YOUR HOUSE YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE IT ANYWAY 
SO YOU CAN EITHER MOVE IT NOW TO HELP THE HOUSE SELL OR YOU CAN LEAVE IT THERE 
MAYBE AFFECT THE SALE PRICE THEN HAVE TO MOVE IT IN THE END ANYWAY WE APPRECIATE THIS 
WE'VE GOT TO CATER FOR THE BUYER'S NEEDS AND NOT YOUR NEEDS 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT DOING THE OPEN HOUSE WE ARE DOING IT FOR A SMALL TIME FRAME YEAH 
YOUR MASTER BEDROOM IS GORGEOUS A FEW TWEAKS IN THERE AND WE'RE DONE 
RIGHT IT'S NOT INSURMOUNTABLE NO YOU'VE GOT A GORGEOUS HOUSE YEAH 
BUT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF PACKING TO BE DONE DO YOU KNOW WHEN THAT STARTS HAPPENING 
NOT QUITE 
IT STARTS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW START PACKING COME ON LET'S DO IT 
WITH THE BIG DAY FAST APPROACHING OUR TRANSFORMATION KICKS OFF WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE SPACE TAKING SOFAS 
WE'VE ALSO GOT A VERITABLE COTTAGE FULL OF CLUTTER TO DISMANTLE CARRY OFF CLEAR UP WHEEL AWAY BOX UP 
WALLS CURTAINS FURNITURE YOU NAME IT WE'RE LOSING IT 
BUT THE BEAUTY OF AN OPEN HOUSE IS WE ONLY NEED TO STORE IT FOR ONE DAY 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MIGHT PUT POTENTIAL BUYERS OFF THE PROPERTY 
IS THE FACT THAT THE BATHROOM IS DOWNSTAIRS 
BUT I THINK I MAY HAVE FOUND A SOLUTION FOR THAT AND THAT SOLUTION LIES 
OVER IN THE NEIGHBOUR'S GARDEN WITH THAT WHOPPING TWO STOREY EXTENSION 
AN EXTENSION LIKE THE NEIGHBOUR'S COULD OPEN THE WILLIAMS' PROPERTY TO A WIDER MARKET SO WE'VE ARRANGED 
FOR AN EXPERT IN ARCHITECTURE AND HER ASSISTANT TO VISIT RON AND MARGARET'S AND DRAW UP SOME DESIGNS 
WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF PUTTING A BATHROOM UPSTAIRS 
BECAUSE THAT IS PERCEIVED TO BE MORE APPEALING TO BUYERS 
THIS IS THE OPTION WHICH SHOWS TWO LARGE BEDROOMS 
ONE EXISTING BEDROOM AND ONE NEW ONE ON TOP OF THE KITCHEN EACH WITH AN EN SUITE BATHROOM 
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOCK UP AN EXTENSION IN A FEW DAYS 
I JUST WANT TO PRESENT POSSIBLE BUYERS WITH DESIGNS AND MOCK UPS 
SO THE PROPERTY'S FULL POTENTIAL IS CLEAR ON THE OPEN DAY 
WITH OUR OPEN HOUSE ON THE HORIZON THERE'S STILL PLENTY TO DO 
THE NEW SOFA ARRIVES FOR THE LIVING ROOM AND IT IS ALL HANDS TO THE ROLLERS TO TRANSFORM THE KITCHEN 
AND OUTSIDE BY THE MAGIC OF REMOTE CONTROL THE KNIGHT RIDER OF CARAVANS 
IS HOOKED UP AND FINALLY BANISHED FROM THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
NOW THE ONE THING YOU DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN IF YOU'RE HOSTING AN OPEN DAY 
IS TO GET STUCK WITH ONE PERSON ASKING YOU ENDLESS QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR PROPERTY AND THE AREA 
SO WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS TAKE ALL THAT INFORMATION AND PUT IT IN A SPECIALLY MADE PROPERTY PROFILE PACK 
INCLUDE ALL THE NECESSARY DETAILS ABOUT YOUR HOME WITH PHOTOGRAPHS OF EVERY ROOM 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE BIDDING PROCESS AND DETAILS OF LOCAL ATTRACTIONS LIKE RESTAURANTS 
AND IN THIS CASE THE FANTASTIC BOATING FACILITIES ON THE RIVER GREAT OUSE 
AND WE'RE ALSO INCLUDING OUR EXPERT'S PLANS FOR THE POTENTIAL EXTENSION 
OUR OPEN HOUSE IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER 
THE WILLIAMS HOPE TO RAISE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FROM THE SALE OF THEIR HOME THE SAME AS THE AGENT'S MARKETING PRICE 
AND TO STAND A GOOD CHANCE THE HOUSE NEEDS TO BE PERFECT 
AND THE KEY TO PERFECT STAGING IS ATTENTION TO DETAIL 
ONE OF THE PERSONALITY TRAITS OF MOST COTTAGES BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALL CUTE AND CUDDLY 
IS THE FACT THEY'VE GOT SMALL WINDOWS THEREFORE NOT ALLOWING LOTS OF LIGHT IN 
THE INTERIORS CAN BE A BIT MOODY SO EVEN IF IT'S BRIGHT SUNSHINE ON THE OUTSIDE 
ON YOUR OPEN DAYS MAKE SURE YOU SWITCH YOUR LIGHTS ON 
WHEN IT COMES TO ACCENT LAMPS LIKE THIS IT'S IMPORTANT TO LIGHT THOSE AS WELL 
BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE EMITTING A LOT OF LIGHT BUT THEY ARE EMITTING A LOT OF AMBIENCE 
THE WILLIAMS' HOUSE IS FINALLY READY TO WELCOME POTENTIAL BUYERS 
THE TREASURE TROVE OF PERSONAL MEMORIES THAT WAS THEIR LIVING ROOM 
IS NOW A TIDY SPACE TRANSFORMED BY A SMART NEW SOFA AND A FEW CHOICE ITEMS TO MAKE IT FEEL MORE CONTEMPORARY 
THE ELABORATE FRILLY CURTAINS AND YELLOW DECOR WERE VERY MUCH THE WILLIAMS' PERSONAL TASTES 
WITH A LICK OF WHITE PAINT AND THE REMOVAL OF THE CURTAINS THIS ROOM HAS BEEN COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED 
IT'S NOW A BRIGHT COTTAGE KITCHEN WITH A MODERN TWIST 
UPSTAIRS THE SECOND BEDROOM WAS SUFFERING AN IDENTITY CRISIS 
BUT BY REMOVING THE MAKESHIFT OFFICE AND BRINGING IN A WELL DRESSED DOUBLE BED 
NOW THIS ROOM KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS A SUPERBLY STAGED DEDICATED DOUBLE BEDROOM 
IN A NUTSHELL WE'VE TAKEN A PROPERTY BURSTING WITH TOO MUCH PERSONALITY 
AND TRANSFORMED IT INTO A PERFECTLY STAGED CHARACTER COTTAGE 
AND THANKS TO THE REMOVAL OF RON'S CARAVAN BUYERS CAN SEE THE ENTRANCE IN ALL ITS GLORY 
IT'S THE BIG DAY FOR THE WILLIAMS WHEN THEY THROW OUT THEIR DOORS TO POTENTIAL BUYERS 
AND INVITE BIDS TO SELL THEIR HOME 
THEY HOPE TO RAISE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO MOVE CLOSER TO THE GRANDKIDS AND TAKE A TRIP DOWN UNDER 
THEIR AGENT ALSO MARKETED THE PROPERTY AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAND 
SO WILL ALL OUR HARD WORK PAY OFF 
RON AND MARGARET WHAT CAN I SAY 
I FEEL THAT SOMEHOW WE'VE RESTORED CHERRY TREE COTTAGE ARE YOU PLEASED 
YEAH WE ARE PLEASED THE KITCHEN LOOKS GREAT THE BEDROOMS LOOK GREAT 
WHO IS NOW SLIGHTLY NERVOUS ABOUT THE OPEN DAY 
ME MORE A LOT 
REALLY WHY WHY ARE YOU NERVOUS 
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT WHEN I MEET EVERYBODY THAT'LL BE FINE 
I THINK JUST TREAT THEM LIKE YOU WOULD ANY OTHER GUESTS 
MAKE THEM AT HOME GIVE THEM TEAS CHAMPAGNE WHATEVER THEY WANT 
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO ASK ME BEFORE WE DO THE OPEN DAY 
BEING A SALESMAN I'D ALWAYS WANT TO GO IN BOTH FEET SO I'VE GOT TO REALLY KNOW 
HOW MUCH YOU WANT MARGARET AND I TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PRESENTATION AND THE CHAT 
I'LL TELL YOU HOW MUCH EVERYTHING 
O. K. BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S YOUR HOME 
YOU LOVE THIS HOME THAT ENTHUSIASM WILL RUB OFF ON OTHER PEOPLE 
I SOMETIMES WONDER NOW WHY WE'RE LEAVING 
THIS IS THE WRONG TIME TO HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS 
THE WRONG TIME RIGHT ARE YOU READY 
WE'RE AS READY AS WE'LL EVER BE 
RIGHT LET'S GET OURSELVES STATIONED COME ON LET'S DO IT 
SO THE HOUSE IS LOOKING GREAT NOW WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE 
WE'RE READY TO WELCOME POTENTIAL BUYERS WITH OPEN ARMS O. K. WE'RE MINUTES AWAY 
FINAL TOUCHES WE NEED TO GET THE REST OF THE GLASSES OUT GET THE KETTLE ON FOR THE COFFEE 
YOU NEED TO OPEN THE CHAMPAGNE I NEED TO CHAT WITH THE ESTATE AGENT 
GO GO GO GO GO 
HEY NICKY HOW ARE YOU 
HOW ARE YOU GOOD TO SEE YOU 
YOU TOO WE NEED TO HAVE A BIT OF A CHAT 
WE DO COME AND TELL ME YOU'VE GOT A GORGEOUS HOUSE THERE TO SELL 
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING LOTS OF PROMOTION AND HARD WORK 
HEAPS OF PROMOTION YEAH LOADS AND LOADS OF RESPONSE 
GOOD NOW TELL ME HOW MANY PEOPLE DO WE THINK ARE GOING TO TURN UP TWELVE 
TWELVE TWELVE'S A VERY HEALTHY NUMBER 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU OUT HERE 
AS A GORGEOUS BLONDE SMILE TO GREET PEOPLE 
I'M GOING TO GO IN AND MAKE SURE RON AND MARGARET ARE ALL RIGHT 
AND WHEN WE PUSH PEOPLE BACK OUT AFTERWARD IF YOU CAN GIVE THEM THE EXTRA HARD SELL AT THE END 
CERTAINLY WILL DO IS THAT ALL RIGHT YEAH COOL I'LL SEE YOU SHORTLY BYE 
THE FIRST POTENTIAL BUYERS HAVE ARRIVED BUT RON IS STILL FINE TUNING HIS SALES STRATEGY 
INSTEAD OF US BEING IN A CLUSTER DO YOU WANT ME TO STAND SLIGHTLY

IT'S GOT THE FACILITIES OF A DISH WASHER THAT'S YOUR FREEZER 
YOU CAN PUT A MORE UP TO DATE SHOWER IN I WANT TO BRING THAT COUPLE OUT HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE EXTENSION 
MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN'T GET RON AND MARGARET TO STOP TALKING 
OH HANG ON 
BLAIR CAN I BRING YOU OUT HERE TO HAVE A LOOK AT THIS 
SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE INTERESTING IS THE FACT THAT 
HELLO 
WHAT YOU CAN GET THE NEIGHBOURS HAVE DONE IT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT BIGGER 
YOU'RE A BUILDER AREN'T YOU YES WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING YOU WOULD DO OR NOT 
IT'S SOMETHING WE'D BE INTERESTED IN DOING YEAH 
WE JUST EXTENDED AN OLD STYLE COTTAGE SO WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR THE NEXT PROJECT 
OUR FIRST POTENTIAL BUYER IS THE IDEAL PERSON TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR PLANS FOR THE EXTENSION 
IT'S A PROMISING START AND WITH OUR NEXT BUYER ARRIVING THINGS ARE GOING TO PLAN 
AND MARGARET IS DOING A GREAT JOB SHOWING ANOTHER POTENTIAL BUYER AROUND THE HOUSE 
I HAVE ONE LITTLE NIGGLING CONCERN WHICH IS THAT RON AND MARGARET ARE DOING A FABULOUS SALES PITCH 
THEY'RE TALKING TEN TO THE DOZEN BUT THE POTENTIAL BUYERS ARE NOT ACTUALLY HAVING A CHANCE TO 
HELLO THERE PLOUGH ON THROUGH GIVING THEM A CHANCE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS 
YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN CARRY ON 
THERE'S STORAGE SPACE UNDER THE STAIRS UP THE STAIRS 
AGAIN IT'S A SUPER SIZED ROOM 
THIS IS THE ONE THAT TENDS TO TAKE PEOPLE BY SURPRISE 
BECAUSE THIS RUNS THE FULL DEPTH OF THE HOUSE LOVELY 
WITH RON SELLING FOR ENGLAND I'VE GOT TIME TO RAISE A FEW CONCERNS WITH HIS ESTATE AGENT 
I'M SLIGHTLY CONCERNED WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH ONLY A FEW PEOPLE IN 
YEAH NO SUNDAY MORNING 
DON'T PANIC IT WILL BE FINE

PROMISE PROMISE GOOD I'M GLAD SHE'S CONFIDENT BECAUSE OUR FIRST POTENTIAL BUYERS ARE LEAVING 
MAKE MUMMY AND DADDY BID FOR THE HOUSE 
SO WE'RE DOWN TO JUST ONE VIEWER

THERE'S A LOT FOR US TO THINK ABOUT APART FROM THAT 
WE'RE REALLY IMPRESSED WITH IT WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE THE POTENTIAL IN THE HOUSE THAT'S RIGHT YEAH 
MARGARET IS DOING A GREAT JOB OF SELLING THE EXTENSION 
A BALCONY THERE IT'S RATHER NICE THAT IDEA 
THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT 
AND AT LAST ANOTHER POTENTIAL BUYER ARRIVES' 
HELLO I'M KRISTIAN LOVELY TO MEET YOU

NO I WILL HAVE A CHAT WITH RON AND MARGARET 
KEEP YOUR EYE OUT JUST IN CASE THE MOST AWFUL PEOPLE TURN UP HOW DARE THEY LET US DOWN 
NICKY'S CLEARLY UPSET AND IT FALLS TO ME TO EXPLAIN THE POSITION TO RON AND MARGARET 
SHE'S BEATING HERSELF UP OUTSIDE AND IS VERY UPSET 
BUT I FEEL THAT THE PEOPLE WE'VE HAD HERE WERE SERIOUS CONTENDERS 
SOMETHING MAY RISE FROM THE ASHES HERE WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 
I'M VERY UPBEAT ABOUT IT GOOD 
AND BANG ON CUE TIME'S UP 
WELL THERE YOU HAVE IT THE FRONT DOOR IS CLOSED ON OUR OPEN HOUSE AND OUR OPEN DAY IS OVER 
MY GOODNESS WHAT AN EMOTIVE EXPERIENCE THAT WAS WE'VE HAD TEARS AND TENSION 
I THINK THAT TENSION IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE BECAUSE NOW ALL THOSE POTENTIAL BIDDERS 
HAVE A FEW HOURS TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO PUT A BID IN ON THIS RATHER GORGEOUS PROPERTY 
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET A BID TODAY 
I DON'T THINK SO I DON'T THINK SO 
AND THEY WON'T HAVE A CLUE IF THAT'S THE CASE UNTIL AFTER THE DEADLINE 
BECAUSE ALL THE BIDS MUST GO THROUGH THE ESTATE AGENT 
I'M ANXIOUS NOW AS WELL ARE YOU I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO BE ARE YOU REALLY 
WELL EVEN IF WE GET NO BIDS AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING BECAUSE THE THING IS 
IS THAT TRUE I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE 
WITH RON MAKING THE BEST OF A WORST CASE SCENARIO BEFORE IT'S EVEN HAPPENED 
BUYERS ARE MAKING UP THEIR MINDS THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE IS REALLY NICE WHEN YOU WALK UP THE DRIVE 
WE'RE REALLY IMPRESSED WITH FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
YOU DON'T GET MANY CHARACTER PROPERTIES 
WITH THE PARKING AND A NICE GARDEN AROUND HERE VERY MUCH AT ALL 
SO YEAH IT WAS GOOD IT WAS GOOD 
MEANWHILE THE PRESSURE OF WAITING IS STARTING TO TELL AT THE COTTAGE 
AS RON AND MARGARET HAVE NO IDEA IF WE'LL HAVE A BID 
WE NEED TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH WE NEED TO SPEND ON THIS TO MAKE IT OUR HOUSE 
WE NEED TO GO AND THINK ABOUT THAT 
BUT IF THE SUMS WORK OUT CORRECTLY YES WE WILL BE MAKING A BID 
SO WHILE THEY CRUNCH THE NUMBERS ALL WE CAN DO IS WAIT 
AS OUR DEADLINE APPROACHES OUR COUPLE FINALLY TAKE THE PLUNGE AND PUT IN THEIR BID 
WE WOULD LIKE TO PUT AN OFFER IN PLEASE 
BUT WILL IT BE ANYWHERE NEAR THE WILLIAMS' DREAM TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
