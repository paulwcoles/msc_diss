STRIKE AT SCOTLAND'S BIGGEST OIL 
REFINERY THE GOVERNMENT HAS URGED 
MOTORISTS NOT TO PANIC BUY FUEL 
MINISTERS INSIST THERE ARE 
SUFFICIENT STOCKS OF PETROL AND

WALK OUT TOMORROW MORNING IN A 
DISPUTE OVER PENSIONS AND AHEAD OF 
THAT B. P. WILL TONIGHT SHUT DOWN A 
PIPELINE THAT DELIVERS MORE THAN A 
THIRD OF THE U. K.'S OIL PRODUCTION 
ANDREW CASSELL IS AT GRANGEMOUTH 
FOR US THIS EVENING 
CONFIRMATION THAT THE FORTIES 
PIPELINE SYSTEM WILL BE CLOSED HAS 
PROMPTED SOME OF THE MOST SENIOR 
FIGURES WITHIN BRITAIN'S OIL AND 
GAS INDUSTRY TO CALL ON GOVERNMENT 
MINISTERS TO INTERVENE DIRECTLY 
THEY SAY EIGHTY OFFSHORE OIL COMPANIES 
WILL BE AFFECTED THEY SAY THAT THE 
COUNTRY IS BEING LELD TO RANSOM AND 
IT IS HIGH TIME THAT GOVERNMENT 
MINISTERS STEPPED IN TO TRY TO 
BRING AN END TO THIS DISPUTE 
AT THE GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY ALL 
PRODUCTION HAS STOPPED BUT IT IS 
STILL ON WHAT THEY CALL HOT 
STANDBY WHICH MEANS IT CAN RESUME 
OPERATIONS WITHIN DAYS OF THE 
STRIKE ENDING THIS FOLLOWS TALKS 
WITH THE UNION WHO ALSO AGREED NA 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY WORKERS WILL REMAIN AT THEIR 
POSTS DURING THE STOPPAGE FOR 
SAFETY REASONS BUT THERE'S BEEN NO 
REPRIEVE FOR THE B. P. PLANT WHICH 
OPERATES THE MAIN FORTIES PIPELINE 
BRINGING CRUDE OIL FROM THE NORTH 
SEA B. P. SAYS IT WILL BE SHUT DOWN 
BY TOMORROW THAT WILL CUT FLIES OF 
MORE THAN FORTY PER CENT OF BRITAIN'S OIL AND 
THIRTY PER CENT OF THE NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION 
EVEN SO MINISTERS INSIST THERE IS 
NO IMMINENT FUEL CRISIS THERE'S THERE'S ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF PETROL AND 
DIESEL IN SCOTLAND WE HAVE BEEN 
BUILDING UP SUPPLIES IN SCOTLAND 
KNOWING THIS DISPUTE WAS LIKELY TO 
HAPPEN THE MESSAGE FOR EVERYONE IN 
SCOTLAND IS THERE IS ENOUGH PETROL 
AND DIESEL 
TODAY LORRIES LADEN 
WITH FUEL WERE STILL LEAVING THE 
GRANGEMOUTH DEPOT BUT EFFORT TO 
SHIP IN FOREIGN OIL HAVE FOUNDERED 
BECAUSE THE COMPANY SAYS IT CAN'T 
GET AGREEMENT TO OFFLOAD THEM WE WE NEED ASSURANCE THAT IS ANY FUEL 
LEAVING THE SITE WOULD ONLY BE 
SUPPLIED TO ESSENTIAL SERVICES 
PETROL FORECOURTS IN CENTRAL 
SCOTLAND APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN LESS 
BUSY IN RECENT DAYS BUT MOTORISTS 
COMPLAIN OF ERATTIC SUPPLIES AND 
ISOLATED CASES OF PANIC BUYING 
MINISTERS CONTINUE TO INSIST THERE 
IS AMPLE SUPPLY IN THE SYSTEM UNTIL 
THE MIDDLE OF NEXT MONTH BUT 
HAVING ENOUGH SUPPLIES IN THE 
SYSTEM IS ONE THING THE LOGISTICS 
OF GETTING THEM TO WHERE THEY ARE 
NEEDED IS ANOTHER AND IT COULD 
PROVE A PROBLEM TO GET SOME 
SUPPLIES TO THE MORE REMOIT PARTS 
OF SCOTLAND
