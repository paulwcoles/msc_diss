IT'S TIME FOR OUR REGULAR LOOK AT HOLIDAY DESTINATIONS 
AND WE'LL START IN EUROPE IT'S NOT LOOKING GREAT 
TWO MAIN AREAS OF RAIN ONE FOR SPAIN AND PORTUGAL 
AND ANOTHER ONE RIGHT THROUGH CENTRAL EUROPE 
BRINGING A BIT OF BREEZE FAIR BIT OF CLOUD 
AND QUITE A BIT OF RAIN 
THE RAIN THOUGH NOT GETTING DOWN TO TURKEY AND GREECE 
SHOULD BE A FINE START TO THE WEEKEND MIDDLE TWENTIES 
DRY BRIGHT AND LONG SUNNY SPELLS 
SOME SUNSHINE TOO IN SICILY 
BIT OF PATCHY CLOUD ACROSS THE HEART OF ITALY 
BUT NINETEEN DEGREES IN A DRY ROME 
RAIN SLEET AND SNOW OVER THE HILLS OF NORTHERN ITALY 
HEADING NOW TOWARDS SPAIN AND PORTUGAL 
HERE'S THAT RAIN IN CLOSE UP QUITE A BIT OF IT THROUGH SATURDAY 
JUST FOURTEEN DEGREES IN MADRID 
SOME OF THE COSTAS IN EASTERN SPAIN NOT FARING TOO BADLY

AND FURTHER SHOWERS TO COME IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE WEEKEND 
HEADING NORTH INTO FRANCE

SOME OF THAT RAIN SPREADING INTO PARIS ON SATURDAY 
JUST FOURTEEN DEGREES HERE 
YOU CAN DROP THOSE TEMPERATURES EVEN FURTHER IN A WINDY BRUSSELS

SOME RAIN TOO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC 
THIS WEATHER FRONT WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA 
ATLANTA QUITE WET ON SATURDAY BUT THE RAIN STAYS AWAY FROM NEW YORK 
SHOULD BE FINE WITH SOME SUNSHINE HERE

AROUND SEVENTY FAHRENHEIT SHOULD BE A DECENT START TO THE WEEKEND 
BUT I SUSPECT IT'S ALL CHANGE AS WE LOOK TOWARDS SUNDAY 
THE WINDS SWITCH AROUND TO THE NORTH

HEADING BACK TOWARDS OUR SHORES

MOST OF IT LIGHT AND PATCHY

WITH A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD AROUND 
RAIN ACROSS THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND AND A STRONG EASTERLY WIND 
WILL KEEP IT ON THE COOL SIDE NINE DEGREES AT BEST IN LONDON 
COOL AND WINDY FOR THE EAST COAST OF ENGLAND 
THE RAIN IN THE NORTH EAST TURNS A BIT MORE SHOWERY FOR THE AFTERNOON 
ONE OR TWO SHOWERS ACROSS THE HIGHER GROUND OF SCOTLAND 
BUT GENERALLY DRY AND BRIGHT PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH WEST 
SOME DECENT SUNSHINE FOR MUCH OF THE DAY 
WINDY IN NORTHERN IRELAND WITH ONE OR TWO SHOWERS FOR THE AFTERNOON 
BECOMING FEWER AND FURTHER BETWEEN 
AFTER A DRY BUT WINDY START IN THE SOUTH OF WALES 
WE'LL KEEP THE WIND INTO THE AFTERNOON AND SEE A BIT OF RAIN 
VERY WINDY IN THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND
