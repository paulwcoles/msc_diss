I'M NICKY TAYLOR AND OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS 
I'VE USED MY OWN BODY TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF BINGE DRINKING 
PLASTIC SURGERY I'VE PUT MYSELF UNDER THE KNIFE 
AND I'VE EVEN GONE SIX WEEKS WITHOUT WASHING 
IT'S MY WAY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TO OURSELVES 
AND NOW WITH THE CANNABIS DEBATE RAGING I'M GOING TO POT 
LIKE MANY OTHERS I SMOKED CANNABIS AT COLLEGE IN FACT OVER FIFTEEN MILLION OF US HAVE TRIED IT 
BUT FEW ARE FESSING UP 
DO YOU GUYS DO CANNABIS NO NO NO 
NO 
APART OF COURSE FROM A SELECT GROUP OF GOVERNMENT MINISTERS 
AND A THIRD OF ALL BRITISH TEENAGERS 
BUT DO YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT DO YES YES HER 
MOST PEOPLE OUR AGE DO 
IT'S A SECRET SOCIETY EVERYBODY DOES IT NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT 
IS IT MORE DANGEROUS THAN ALCOHOL 
IS IT STRONGER THAN IT USED TO BE WILL IT DRIVE US MAD 
OR TO COKE OR TO SMACK 
I'M GOING TO FIND OUT 
THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE 
PRO CANNABIS CAMPAIGNERS THINK IT'S RELATIVELY HARMLESS 
THEY'D LOVE IT TO BE LEGALISED 
THE GOVERNMENT'S WORRIED ABOUT THE RISKS AND WANTS TO TOUGHEN UP THE LAW 
IT'S CONFUSING AND EVERY DAY THERE'S ANOTHER SCARY HEADLINE 
BUT WHAT ARE THE FACTS I WANT TO UNPICK THE SCIENCE FROM THE FICTION 
GET A PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S GOING ON AS A MUM I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT COULD BE 
IN STORE FOR MY CHILDREN 
ONE IN SEVEN KIDS UNDER THIRTEEN HAVE TRIED IT BUT IS IT STILL LIKE THE STUFF I TRIED AT COLLEGE 
AND WHAT EFFECT WOULD IT HAVE ON ME NOW 
I'M GOING TO SMOKE CANNABIS ON AND OFF FOR A MONTH TO FIND OUT 
FIRST I'D BETTER FIND OUT WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN TO ME 
I'M OFF TO SEE A DOCTOR FOR A RISK ASSESSMENT 
I JUST THOUGHT THIS WAS AN EXPERIMENT I COULD DO I CAN DO EACH STRENGTH OF CANNABIS 
WHAT HAVE I GOT TO LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF THIS 
YOU'VE GOT PSYCHOLOGICAL PHYSICAL EFFECTS 
WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS NORMALLY YOU GET SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS 
WHERE YOU CAN'T REMEMBER THINGS YOU'VE DONE THAT DAY OR THE DAY BEFORE 
YOU GET REDUCED CO ORDINATION AND MOTOR FUNCTIONS SO YOU MAY BE FALLING DOWN 
YOU'LL BE A BIT SLOWER YOU MIGHT GET SOME PARANOIA 
LONG TERM THAT COULD LEAD TO SCHIZOPHRENIA 
YOU MIGHT GET DEPRESSED WITH IT IT CAN CAUSE SLEEP DISTURBANCE AND EVEN NIGHTMARES 
PHYSICALLY IT CAN AFFECT BLOOD PRESSURE AND MAKE THE HEART RATE GO UP 
WHICH CAN CAUSE CHEST PAIN 
IS THAT ALL IF YOU'VE COME FOR MY ADVICE IT WOULD BE THAT I WOULD NOT DO IT 
WELL AT LEAST I KNOW WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR 
I'M BEGINNING TO NOTICE THAT CANNABIS CULTURE IS ALL AROUND ME THIS HEAD SHOP 
IS ONE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED YOU CAN FIND ON OUR HIGH STREETS WHERE BETTER TO START MY JOURNEY 
EXCUSE ME WHAT'S THIS FOR WHAT'S IT FOR 
IT'S A ROLLING WALLET BASICALLY 
A ROLLING WALLET IT'S GOT ALL YOUR COMPARTMENTS THERE 
WHAT DO YOU PUT IN HERE WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE TO PUT IN THERE 
OH RIGHT O. K. WHATEVER I CHOOSE TO PUT IN THERE 
ALL FOR SOUVENIR PURPOSES THESE ARE JUST SOUVENIRS DO A LOT OF PEOPLE COME IN HERE TO BUY SOUVENIRS 
YEAH WE SELL A LOT OF GROWING EQUIPMENT AS WELL 
BUT NOT FOR GROWING NO IT'S FOR TOMATO PLANTS RIGHT OH I SEE 
REALLY BIG TOMATOES 
MASSIVE ONES 
DO YOU HAVE ANY SEEDS THAT YOU CAN SELL OF THESE PLANTS 
WE CAN BASICALLY GET YOU ANY SEEDS ANY SEEDS YOU WANT 
THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE BRANDS AND THIS IS ALL LEGAL 
YEAH IT IS THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SELLING THE ACTUAL SEEDS OR THE GROWING EQUIPMENT 
YOU JUST CAN'T PUT THEM TOGETHER 
SO YOU CAN BUY THE SEEDS AND YOU CAN BUY THE GROW KIT 
BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO USE THEM TOGETHER 
COULD I GET AWAY WITH A LITTLE EXPERIMENTAL USE MYSELF 
WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY ABOUT SMOKING CANNABIS 
I ASKED A BARRISTER RICHARD CROSS TO EXPLAIN THE LAW IN THIS COUNTRY TO ME 
IS IT ILLEGAL TO SMOKE CANNABIS IN THIS COUNTRY 
YES YES IT REMAINS ILLEGAL UNDER THE MISUSE OF DRUGS ACT NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE 
IT CAN BE PUNISHED WITH A CUSTODIAL SENTENCE AND IT IS STILL PROHIBITED 
EVEN IF IT WAS JUST A VERY SMALL AMOUNT 
AS IT STANDS THE LAW IS UNAMBIGUOUS THAT POSSESSION OF CANNABIS IS UNLAWFUL 
SO OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE IN THIS COUNTRY ER NO 
THE ONLY EXCEPTION WOULD BE IF IT WAS A MEDICAL EXPERIMENT UNDER LICENCE 
SO IT'S CLEAR IN THIS COUNTRY IT IS STILL ILLEGAL TO SMOKE CANNABIS 
BUT THERE IS ONE PLACE IN EUROPE WHERE I KNOW YOU CAN SMOKE A JOINT WITHOUT GETTING ARRESTED 
AMSTERDAM IT'S THE GANJA CAPITAL OF THE WESTERN WORLD 
IF THERE'S ANYWHERE I CAN TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE ALLURE OF CANNABIS AND ITS RISKS IT'S HERE 
I JUST NEED TO FOLLOW MY NOSE TO A COFFEE SHOP 
AND NOT BECAUSE I'M IN NEED OF A QUICK CAPPUCCINO 
THERE ARE OVER NINE HUNDRED COFFEE SHOPS IN HOLLAND AND THEY DON'T JUST SELL COFFEE 
THEY'RE LICENSED TO SELL CANNABIS THIS IS THE DAMPKRING ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR ONES HERE 
HI DRUGS 
THEY'VE AGREED TO LET ME DO OCCASIONAL WORK HERE FOR A MONTH 
AND OFF DUTY I'LL BE ABLE TO SMOKE THE CANNABIS I'M INTRODUCED TO DENIS THE DEPUTY MANAGER 
AND BOWIE THE COFFEE SHOP CAT 
THE DAMPKRING'S WELL KNOWN FOR STOCKING A WIDE RANGE OF CANNABIS VARIETIES 
SOME IMPORTED BUT MOST OF IT LOCALLY GROWN 
BABISH BARKER RUNS THE SHOP 
SHE'S BEEN BUYING AND SELLING DOPE FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
DO YOU SMOKE REGULARLY 
CIGARETTES NO MARIJUANA NO O. K. 
WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS 
AND YOU DO MARIJUANA HASHISH 
I THINK THE BEST FOR YOU WOULD BE TO START WITH JAMAICA WHICH IS AN OUTDOOR GRASS 
NOT AS STRONG AS THE OTHERS 
IT'S UPLIFTING THOUGH MAKES YOU FEEL KINDA TIPSY 
WE HAVE IT PRE ROLLED 
YEAH COS I CAN'T ROLL THAT'S WHY WE MAKE THOSE 
SO YOU'VE GOT PRE ROLLED JAMAICAN SPLIFF YEAH IT'S MIXED WITH TOBACCO SO YOU CAN JUST SIT DOWN 
GRAB A COFFEE READ A PAPER SMOKE YOUR JOINT AND CHILL OUT 
JUST MAKE SURE YOU REALLY ENJOY IT 
TAKE TWO OR THREE PUFFS FIRST AND THEN PUT IT DOWN FOR TEN MINUTES AND SEE WHAT IT DOES 
THEN IF YOU DON'T FEEL ENOUGH YOU CAN HAVE ANOTHER PUFF 
AND IF IT'S ALREADY FINE JUST LEAVE IT FOR A WHILE 
WHEN IT SLIPS OFF YOU CAN JUST LIGHT IT UP AGAIN O. K. 
IT'S DAY ONE OF MY MONTH LONG EXPERIMENT 
THE DAY I TRY MY FIRST SPLIFF 
JUST IN CASE I HAVE MEDICAL HELP ON STANDBY 
SO THIS IS IT 
I'M GOING TO SMOKE A TENTH OF A GRAM OF JAMAICAN WEED MIXED WITH TOBACCO 
I'M NOT FEELING ANYTHING I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M GETTING ANY EFFECT NOTHING'S HAPPENING TO ME 
I HADN'T REALISED THAT THE CANNABIS HADN'T HAD TIME TO TAKE EFFECT 
SO I KEEP PUFFING 
I'M A LITTLE MORE RELAXED BUT A LITTLE FUNNY 
A BIT SORT OF 
A BIT LIKE MOTION SICKNESS 
BUT BABISH HAD SAID TAKE TWO PUFFS AND THEN A BREAK 
I FEEL LIKE 
BOWIE HAS SEEN IT ALL BEFORE 
TEN MINUTES AND TWENTY FIVE DRAGS LATER IT HITS ME 
THIS IS REALLY DISTURBING 
IT'S WORSE THAN BEING BLIND DRUNK 
FUCKING HELL 
I'M REALLY FUCKING SCARED 
I SEEM TO HAVE WORKED MYSELF INTO A BIT OF A PANIC ATTACK AND I DON'T KNOW WHY 
O. K. WELL JUST TRY TO THINK ABOUT NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL 
JUST FOCUS ON THE MOMENT 
IT'S A NICE SUNNY MORNING 
THE SUN IS SHINING YEAH 
I HAVE TO SAY THAT WAS THE 
WORST DAY 
EVER EVER OF MY WHOLE LIFE 
INSIDE I WAS ABSOLUTELY PETRIFIED 
AT ONE POINT ONE WAS TOO SCARED TO EVEN GET OUT OF THE CHAIR 
IT WAS LIKE A MASSIVE MASSIVE PANIC ATTACK 
I'VE GOT THIS STUPID FEELING THAT IT'S SORT OF UNLOCKED SOME SORT OF PARANOIA IN MY HEAD 
AND FOREVER I'M GOING TO BE PARANOID 
I JUST DON'T WANT TO DO IT 
I'VE TAKEN 
FAR TOO MUCH AND WHAT'S STUPID IS NOW I'M REALLY SCARED 
ABOUT DOING ANYTHING ELSE 
PART OF ME IS THINKING DO I REALLY WANT TO DO THIS AT ALL 
SORRY GO AWAY NOW 
ONE PACKET OF CASHEW NUTS ONE CHOCOLATE 
BLACK COFFEE 
WAKE ME UP 
I REALLY DO FEEL WASTED 
BUT THE PARANOIA'S GONE 
IT'S DAY TWO AND MY FIRST DAY ON THE JOB AT THE DAMPKRING 
HI GOOD MORNING I'M STILL WORRYING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY 
FINE MY HEAD'S HERE BUT YEAH I DIDN'T FEEL GREAT YESTERDAY 
I THINK YOU GOT TOO HIGH 
THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE T. H. C. I CAN SHOW YOU HOW THAT WORKS IF YOU WANT 
YEAH YEAH SHOW ME 
NOW IF YOU LOOK BEHIND YOU WE HAVE A PICTURE OF A T. H. C. CRYSTAL 
AND THE TOP THE ROUND SHAPED BIT THAT'S THE ONE THAT MAKES YOU REALLY REALLY HIGH 
REALLY YES AND I HAD TOO MUCH OF THAT YOU HAD DEFINITELY TOO MUCH OF THAT 
FIRST A BIT OF BAR WORK MAKES ME FEEL MORE AT HOME BUT I'M GREENER THAN I THOUGHT 
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH IT YOU STICK MARIJUANA IN IT AND THEN YOU 
OH SORRY I'M A BIT OF A NOVICE NO PROBS YOU GET IT BACK YEAH 
WHAT IS IT IT'S HER FIRST DAY YOU KNOW 
SURPRISINGLY THE LOCALLY GROWN VARIETIES ARE THE STRONGEST 
THESE ARE ALL THE PRODUCTS IN THE BIG ONES ARE ALL THE GRASSES THE MARIJUANAS 
AND THESE ARE ALL THE HASHES IN THE LITTLE BOXES 
I'M FEELING A BIT LIKE A SWEET SHOP LADY PICK N. MIX 
MIX N. MATCH 
BUT IN THIS SWEET SHOP YOU HAVE TO BE OVER EIGHTEEN 
OH PASSPORTS 
IS THIS NORMAL YEAH TO CHECK THEIR I. D. YEAH OH BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT SUCH A YOUNG FACE 
I'D LIKE A GRAM OF JACK HERRER PLEASE 
JACK HERRER I KNOW JACK HERRER YOU DO 
O. K. I DO I DO I DO I DO 
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU A GRAM A GRAM RIGHT 
I CAN DO THIS HAVE YOU HAD A LOVELY DAY 
I JUST LANDED 
OH REALLY YOU'VE JUST LANDED 
ARE YOU DUTCH DO YOU LIVE HERE 
NO BUT WHERE I LIVE THE SHOPS ARE CLOSED TONIGHT TILL FOUR SO I HAD TO GO TO AMSTERDAM 
AH WHAT YOUR DRUG SHOPS YOUR COFFEE SHOPS YEAH 
I HAVE VERY CLEAN HANDS 
DO YOU LIKE THIS STUFF OOH IT'S A BIT 
DO I LIKE IT I LOVE IT 
WHAT'S SO GOOD ABOUT JACK HERRER 
I DON'T KNOW USUALLY I SMOKE WHITE WIDOW 
BUT WHEN I WAS YOUNG I USED TO SMOKE JACK HERRER SO IT'S A BIT 
LIKE GOING DOWN MEMORY LANE YES LIKE GOING DOWN MEMORY LANE 
A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE THAT'S A GOOD WORD PLAY 
REGULAR DOPE SMOKERS SAY YOU CAN SMOKE AND STILL CARRY ON YOUR NORMAL LIFE 
I WONDER IF I CAN 
I'VE FINISHED MY SHIFT NOW SO I'M GOING TO TRY A TENTH OF A GRAM OF PURE HASHISH IN A PIPE 
A SMALLER AMOUNT THAN YESTERDAY 
WILL I FEEL ANY DIFFERENT 
THIS TIME I'M FEELING HIGH IN A DIFFERENT WAY 
CHILLED OUT AND GIGGLY 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING JUST 
EVERYTHING'S QUITE FUNNY 
I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SEEMS VERY 
FUNNY 
THE HOLY GRAIL FOR ALL POTHEADS IS AMSTERDAM'S FAMOUS HEMP MUSEUM 
AND STONED AS I AM I'M OFF TO INTERVIEW KEN JOHNSON THE CURATOR 
FOR THIS INTERVIEW I'VE GOT TO TRY TO BE PROFESSIONAL 
BUT HOW LONG CAN I CAN I HOLD IT TOGETHER 
WOW DO YOU ACTUALLY GROW YOUR OWN 
WELL IT'S STRICTLY FOR DEMONSTRATION NONE OF IT LEAVES THE PREMISES 
IT DOESN'T GO TO COFFEE SHOPS 
IT'S MOSTLY DESTROYED ON SITE 
DESTROYED WELL SMOKING DESTROYS IT 
THE HASHISH IS KICKING IN NOW AND KEN'S GETTING REALLY TECHNICAL ON ME 
OUT OF THE PRESENCE OF MALES FOR THE WHOLE CYCLE THEN THE BUD AS WE CALL IT 
SWELLS AND GETS MORE COVERED WITH T. H. C. WHICH IS THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT 
WOULDN'T IT BE FUNNY IF YOU COULD MANUFACTURE YOUR OWN T. H. C. YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO GROW THE PLANT 
WELL YOUR BODY MANUFACTURES ITS OWN CANNABINOIDS WHICH IS WHY IT TAKES AN EFFECT ON US 
WE HAVE A NEUROTRANSMITTER SO CHEMICALLY SIMILAR TO CANNABINOIDS IT'S CLASSED AS ONE 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S MANUFACTURED BY YOUR OWN BODY SO WE'VE GOT A CAB CANAB CABOYOIDS CANNABONABBANOID 
IT'S CALLED ER CANABOID 
WHAT IS IT CALLED CANNABINOID 
T. H. C. CANNABINOIDS 
KEN THINKS ITS RIVETING BUT I'M LOSING INTEREST FAST 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE BIG WORDS 
I'M FINDING IT REALLY HARD TO TAKE IN ANYTHING HE SAYS 
THIS IS A VAPORISER 
FUNNILY ENOUGH MY ATTENTION'S STARTED WANDERING 
AND A PILE OF GUINEA PIG BEDDING SUDDENLY SEEMS SO INVITING 
OH 
OH AREN'T THEY SWEET 
SO YOU MAKE GUINEA PIG BEDDING 
IT'S GOOD FOR AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF THINGS 
IT USED TO RUN PRETTY MUCH HALF THE WORLD UP UNTIL THE NINETEENTH CENTURY NEARLY ALL SHIPS SAILED ON IT 
YOU HAVE HAD A SMOKE TODAY I CAN TELL 
OH NO 
WHAT'S WRONG I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BE EXCUSED 
I'M GOING TO GO TO THE LOO 
I'M NOT THE FIRST BRIT TO COME AND CHILL OUT IN AMSTERDAM 
THERE ARE OVER A MILLION BRITISH TOURISTS A YEAR THOUSANDS OF WHOM 
CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS LIBERAL UTOPIA 
THERE'S A BETTER QUALITY OF SMOKING SO THAT'S IT 
THAT'S WHY WE COME TO AMSTERDAM TO LET GO 
IF IT WERE LEGALISED IN ENGLAND IT WOULD BE MORE CHILLED OUT OVER THERE LIKE IT IS HERE 
AMSTERDAM'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT INNIT THERE'S EVERYTHING YOU WANT IT'S THE REPUTATION 
ALTHOUGH CANNABIS IS MORE AVAILABLE TO THE DUTCH AS A NATION THEY SMOKE LESS OF IT THAN WE DO 
PEOPLE THINK IT'S LEGAL HERE BUT IS THAT TRUE 
WHERE IN THE WORLD IS CANNABIS LEGAL 
I THINK IN TANZANIA IT'S LEGAL JAMAICA 
AMSTERDAM'S THE ONLY PLACE I KNOW 
YEAH AMSTERDAM 
THE ANSWER IS NOWHERE AMSTERDAM MAY BE THE MOST TOLERANT CITY IN THE WORLD 
BUT IT'S STILL ILLEGAL TO POSSESS THE DRUG THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THE UNIQUE WAY 
IN WHICH THE DUTCH AUTHORITIES APPLY THE LAW 
IF THIS POLICEMAN WAS ENGLISH HE'D PROBABLY HAVE TO ARREST THESE DRUG DEALERS 
SO TELL ME HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH CANNABIS IN AMSTERDAM 
WE TOLERATE IT UH HUH 
WHEN THE TOURIST IS COMING TO AMSTERDAM WE TOLERATE THAT THEY USE DRUGS IN THE COFFEE SHOPS 
OR IN THE HOTEL BUT NOT ON THE STREET 
BY ALLOWING A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY IT'S MAKING IT SAFER DO YOU THINK 
WHEN IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO IT 
THEN YOU SEE THAT THE DEALERS ARE COMING ON THE STREET 
THEY BUY IT ON THE STREET THEY GO TO THE HOTEL THEY GO TO THE STATIONS 
SO WE DON'T HAVE 
ANY VIEW ON IT 
IN THE COFFEE SHOP WE KNOW WHO THE OWNER IS WE KNOW THE QUALITY 
LIKE THAT SORT OF THINGS THERE IS NO 
DANGER FOR THE TOURIST TO USE HERE 
IN HOLLAND THERE ARE JUST TWO CLASSES OF DRUG SOFT AND HARD 
THE DUTCH BELIEVE THAT BY TREATING THE TWO CLASSES OF DRUG DIFFERENTLY 
SOFT DRUG USERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO COME INTO CONTACT WITH HARD DRUG USERS 
THEIR HEROIN PROBLEM HAS NOT INCREASED IN TWENTY YEARS 
BUT BACK AT HOME OUR HEROIN PROBLEM HAS GONE UP ONE THOUSAND PER CENT SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
HERE IN THE U. K. THE LAWS ON CLASSIFYING CANNABIS 
HAVE CHANGED RECENTLY BUT NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW QUITE HOW 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT CLASS DRUG CANNABIS IS 
IS IT A NO 
C. INNIT NO IT'S B. 
IT'S A C. AND IT'S GONE UP TO A B. HASN'T IT 
IT'S AN A NO IT'S NOT 
NO IDEA IT'S LEGAL THOUGH INNIT 
I THOUGHT IF YOU HAD A SMALL AMOUNT FOR PERSONAL USE 
YOU WEREN'T ARRESTED 
CAN YOU GO TO PRISON FOR IT NO 
CAN YOU GO TO PRISON FOR CANNABIS 
NO 
YES YOU CAN YOU CAN'T 
WARNING IT'S JUST NOT AS EASY AS ONE TWO THREE SO WHAT IS THE LAW 
WHEN IT WAS A B. DRUG DEALING CANNABIS WOULD HAVE GOT YOU FOURTEEN YEARS BEHIND BARS 
AND POSSESSION UP TO FIVE 
NOW IT'S A C. DRUG YOU STILL GET FOURTEEN YEARS FOR DEALING BUT ONLY TWO YEARS FOR POSSESSION 
DOWNGRADING CANNABIS FROM CLASS B. TO CLASS C. WAS INTENDED TO FREE UP THE POLICE AND COURTS 
FOR MORE SERIOUS CRIMES BUT HAS THAT HAPPENED 
DAME RUTH RUNCIMAN CHAIRED AN INQUIRY INTO THE MISUSE OF DRUGS FOR THE POLICE FOUNDATION 
IN RECLASSIFYING CANNABIS MOST PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS 
THE GOVERNMENT MADE CHANGES TO THE POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT 
THAT RETAINED ARRESTIBILITY FOR ALL CLASS C. DRUGS 
THERE ARE THOSE WHO THINK THE DIFFERENCES NOW BETWEEN 
CLASS B. AND CLASS C. ARE SO SMALL AS TO NOT WARRANT THOSE TWO CLASSES 
I'M OUT WITH THE PETERBOROUGH POLICE AND WHILST THEY HAVE A TOUGH POLICY ON ALCOHOL I'D LIKE TO KNOW 
IF THEY HAVE RELAXED THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS CANNABIS SINCE IT'S RECLASSIFICATION 
A RECENT UNICEF REPORT SAID THAT THE U. K. 
HAD THE THIRD HIGHEST RATE OF TEENS SMOKING DOPE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD 
IN PETERBOROUGH THEY HAVE NEW COMMUNITY METHODS TO GET CLOSER TO THE KIDS ON THE STREETS 
WHY ARE YOU OFFERING SWEETS TO THEM 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY IT MAKES THEM CHANGE 
THEIR MENTALITY FROM AN AGGRESSIVE ADULT TO A COMPLIANT YOUNG PERSON 
WHILST I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY I THOUGHT I'D ASK THE KIDS IF THEY HAD ANY EXPERIENCE OF CANNABIS 
CAN I ASK THEM A QUESTION 
YES YOU CAN COME ON THE VIDEO MAN 
WE'RE JUST FINDING OUT WHETHER YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW HOW THE LAW HAS CHANGED TOWARDS CANNABIS 
DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S CHANGED OR NOT CANNABIS YEAH 
THEY'RE ON ABOUT WACKY BACKY 
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WACKY BACKY 
YEAH YOU DO HAVE YOU TRIED IT BEFORE YEAH 
KANE IS FIFTEEN AND TOLD ME HE STARTED SMOKING WHEN HE WAS THIRTEEN 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED SMOKING IT I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT BUT I DID IT BECAUSE OF MY MATES 
THEN ONCE I GOT USED TO IT I CARRIED ON SMOKING IT EVERY DAY AND THAT WAS IT REALLY 
I SUPPOSE I SORT OF GOT ADDICTED TO IT LIKE FAGS 
THERE'S NO MENTAL ADDICTION YOU DON'T GET PAINS BUT YOU FEEL THAT YOU NEED IT 
AND WHAT DOES IT DO TO YOU CHILLS ME OUT 
MAKES ME CONCENTRATE A LOT MORE AS WELL DOES IT I FIND IT HARD TO CONCENTRATE AT SCHOOL 
YOU SMOKE IT BEFORE SCHOOL 
WHAT EVERYDAY YEAH 
NO I NEED IT TO GO TO SLEEP AND EVERYTHING 
I FIND IT LIKE AN ADDICTION INNIT 
WHAT ABOUT YOU MUM AND DAD WHAT DO THEY SAY MY MUM'S ALL RIGHT WITH IT 
SHE'D RATHER THAT THAN CAUSE TROUBLE WITH MY MATES 
SO WHAT DO THE POLICE DO IF THEY CATCH KIDS SMOKING DOPE 
PREVIOUSLY IT USED TO BE AN ARRESTABLE OFFENCE STRAIGHT AWAY WE'D ARREST THEM 
NOW WE ISSUE A FINAL WARNING FOR USE OF CANNABIS 
I BELIEVE IT'S THREE STRIKES AND THEN IT'S AN ARREST 
KANE LIVES PART TIME WITH HIS GRANDAD IS HE WORRIED THAT CANNABIS MAY LEAD KANE ONTO HARDER DRUGS 
IT CONCERNS ME THAT IT COULD LEAD TO SOMETHING ELSE SOMETHING STRONGER 
AND ONCE THEY GET ONTO SOMETHING STRONGER THEY'RE HOOKED 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A POSSIBILITY WITH KANE IT'S ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY IT'S WORRYING 
IT'S ALL RIGHT KANE SAYING YEAH I'M IN CONTROL 
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER IN CONTROL 
SO YOU TRIED A FEW OTHER LITTLE THINGS YEAH 
BUT YOU DIDN'T LIKE THEM 
I DID BUT I THOUGHT IT'S NOT THE THING TO BE TAKING EVERY DAY INNIT 
I'D RATHER NOT TAKE THEM KNOW WHAT I MEAN JUST STICK TO MY WEED 
BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE TEMPTED OH I'M GONNA TRY SOMETHING HARDER NO 
WHY'S THAT HAVE YOU SEEN THE EFFECTS OF WHAT THE HARD STUFF DOES 
YEAH WHAT'S IT DO IT'S NASTY 
HEROIN AND THAT'S JUST SHIT INNIT IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH TAKING 
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY 
WAKE UP WITH HOT AND COLD SWEATS 
CAN'T STOP MOVING AND THAT INNIT 
DYING BASICALLY MORE OR LESS KILLING YOURSELF DON'T DO NOTHING GOOD FOR ANYONE 
JUST TEARS ALL THEIR FAMILIES AWAY AND WHATEVER INNIT 
IT'S NASTY 
THOUGH KANE'S GRANDAD IS UNDERSTANDABLY CONCERNED ACCORDING TO THE HOME OFFICE 
THE GREAT MAJORITY OF CANNABIS USERS DON'T MOVE ON TO HARDER DRUGS ALTHOUGH FOR THOSE WHO DO 
IT'S BAD NEWS 
BACK IN AMSTERDAM IT'S TIME TO GET BACK TO MY EXPERIMENT AT THE BEGINNING 
THE DOCTOR WARNED ME THAT CANNABIS COULD AFFECT MY CONCENTRATION 
I WANT TO PUT IT TO THE TEST 
I'M GOING TO PERFORM A SIMPLE TASK TO PUT TOGETHER A FLAT PACK CABINET 
I'VE GOT TWO OF THEM 
DIFFERENT MODELS BUT SIMILAR 
ONE I'LL ASSEMBLE SOBER THE SECOND STONED ON CANNABIS 
SOBER MY ABILITY TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS IS FINE 
I'M ON THE BALL I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING 
IT'S JUST THAT I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT IT 
NEXT I'M GOING TO SMOKE A TENTH OF A GRAM OF CANNABIS WITH TOBACCO 
REMEMBERING TO TAKE ONLY TWO DRAGS 
TEN MINUTES LATER AND I'M FACED WITH THE SECOND FLAT PACK CABINET 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START 
I'VE GOT TO CLICK SOMETHING ON THIS AND I CAN'T MAKE A DECISION 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
OH MY GOD ONE ONLY TOOK TWO PUFFS 
YOU BECOME DETACHED AND ALSO NOT INTERESTED IN THINGS 
AND MORE INDIFFERENT 
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANY MORE 
SERIOUSLY IT'S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE I JUST REALLY WANT TO GO OVER THERE 
AND PUT MY HEAD DOWN 
THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF CANNABIS ARE DRY LIPS DRY MOUTH 
DROOPY EYELIDS 
PEOPLE ARE GAZING IN A WAY 
YOU JUST FEEL SO COMPLETELY SPACED OUT 
THERE'S NO WAY I COULD DO ANYTHING 
IT FEELS LIKE BEING SHOT TO OBLIVION 
WHILE MY BRAIN MAY BE SHRINKING MY WAISTLINE CERTAINLY ISN'T 
I'M SO HUNGRY 
APPARENTLY CANNABIS TRIGGERS A CHEMICAL SURGE IN THE BRAIN 
WHICH STIMULATES THE APPETITE 
THERE'S ALSO EVIDENCE THAT CANNABIS LOWERS BLOOD SUGAR 
HENCE THE CRAVING FOR SWEET THINGS 
NO A CUSTARD ONE THIS ONE 
YOU KNOW I FIGHT THE CALORIES SO MUCH AND THEN IN THE SPACE OF 
A BLOODY AFTERNOON I DEMOLISH A WHOLE CAKE 
TWO PACKETS OF CRISPS THOSE FUNNY LITTLE CHEESY BISCUITS THAT I NEVER NORMALLY EAT 
ALMOST A WHOLE PACKET OF DORITOS 
AND I'M EVEN HUNGRY NOW 
I'M BACK IN THE U. K. FOR A BIT OF A BREAK FROM DRUG TAKING 
AND I'VE BEGUN TO NOTICE A PRESSURE ON MY BREATHING 
I KNOW I SMOKE CIGARETTES BUT I'VE NEVER FELT LIKE THIS BEFORE 
HEADLINES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT CANNABIS IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN TOBACCO 
SO I'M OFF TO SEE A TOP LUNG SPECIALIST DOCTOR KON WHO HAS SPENT THE LAST EIGHT YEARS RESEARCHING 
THE EFFECTS OF CANNABIS ON THE LUNGS 
IS PURE CANNABIS WORSE THAN NICOTINE 
WELL THEY'VE DONE THE STUDIES LOOKING AT PURE CANNABIS SMOKERS 
AND ONE JOINT MAY BE EQUIVALENT TO THREE NORMAL TOBACCO CIGARETTES IN TERMS OF THE AIRWAY DAMAGE 
WE CAN SHOW YOU THAT PURE CANNABIS SMOKERS WHO DON'T MIX THEIR JOINTS HAVE LUNG DAMAGE 
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO'S TWENTY TWO AND THEY'RE A CANNABIS SMOKER THEY'VE IN FACT STOPPED NOW 
BASICALLY THEIR LUNGS COLLAPSED AND THEY WERE IN SAINT MARY'S FAIRLY RECENTLY 
THE REASON THAT LUNG HAS COLLAPSED DOWN IS BECAUSE 
THEY'VE GOT HOLES IN THEIR LUNGS 
THIS IS A NORMAL SET OF LUNGS ON A C. T. SCAN 
THIS IS THE EX CANNABIS SMOKER'S 
CAN YOU SEE THESE LITTLE HOLES HERE 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S DOWN TO THE CANNABIS 
IT'S VERY HARD TO IMAGINE ANYTHING ELSE CAUSING IT 
THIS TYPE OF CHANGE WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE WHEN YOU'RE A BIT OLDER FORTY PLUS FIFTY SIXTY 
BUT WE'RE SEEING IT IN A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD 
SO IF I STOPPED STOPPED THE SMOKING 
THE HOLES WOULD HEAL UP AND I'D BE O. K. 
I'M AFRAID NOT THOSE HOLES CANNOT BE REPAIRED THEY ARE PERMANENTLY WITH YOU 
THE LUNG IS NOT A GOOD ORGAN IN TERMS OF REPAIR 
IT'S THE SAME WITH TOBACCO IF YOU DAMAGE IT AND CAUSE HOLES THOSE HOLES ARE PERMANENT 
GOD 
SO WHILST I KNOWINGLY INHALE A BURNING SUBSTANCE A CIGARETTE IN THIS CASE 
I RISK THE POSSIBILITY OF PREMATURE AGEING AN INCREASED RISK OF DYING FROM LUNG CANCER 
AND A FIFTY PER CENT CHANCE OF BEING KILLED BY THE HABIT 
IF I SMOKE CANNABIS THE JURY'S OUT BUT THE ODDS COULD BE HIGHER 
BUT THE PLANT CANNABIS HAS BEEN USED MEDICINALLY FOR OVER FOUR THOUSAND YEARS 
THE CHINESE USED IT FOR UNBLOCKING BOWELS 
BUDDHA ATE IT FOR ENJOYMENT AND QUEEN VICTORIA USED IT FOR P. M. T. 
MORE RECENTLY IT'S BEEN USED AS PAIN RELIEF FOR PEOPLE WITH AIDS PARKINSON'S AND M. S. 
BUT IF IT'S NOT PRESCRIBED IT'S STILL ILLEGAL 
A GRANDMOTHER WHO REFUSES TO GIVE UP USING CANNABIS AS PAIN RELIEF 
IS TO BE GIVEN ONE LAST CHANCE TO AVOID EVICTION FROM HER HOME 
PAT TABRAM HAS BEEN SELF MEDICATING WITH CANNABIS FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS 
TODAY SHE'S GOING TO COURT FOR GROWING AND SMOKING CANNABIS IN HER HOME 
HELLO HELLO SORRY DID I WAKE YOU UP 
I'VE JUST GOT UP 
BIG DAY IT IS 
I HAD PHONE CALLS FROM FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN LAST NIGHT TILL ONE THOUSAND THIRTY FROM WELL WISHERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
SOME OF THEM ARE TRAVELLING FROM ABERDEEN SOME ARE TRAVELLING FROM WEYMOUTH 
JUST TO GO TO THE COURT FOR TWO O'CLOCK THIS AFTERNOON NO 
HONESTLY DO YOU EVER HAVE POLICE COMING ROUND RAIDING YOUR HOUSE LOOKING FOR YOUR DRUGS OH YES 
DO THEY COME WITH SNIFFER DOGS NO THEY'VE NEVER BROUGHT SNIFFER DOGS 
BECAUSE IF THEY COME IN HERE AND SAY WHERE'S YOUR GREEN I USUALLY TELL THEM 
I DID HIDE IT SOMEWHERE AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE I'VE PUT IT 
THAT'S A PROBLEM HIDING IT AND THEN 
FORGETTING WHERE YOU'VE PUT IT I DO IT ALL THE TIME 
WOULD YOU PUT IT IN THE CUPBOARDS 
IT'S BEHIND SOMETHING BEHIND THE WASHING MACHINE NO 
CAN DOCTORS PRESCRIBE IT OR NOT OR IS THAT ACTUALLY COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN 
WELL THERE ARE MEDICINES AVAILABLE WITH CANNABIS IN THERE'S ABOUT THREE 
BUT WHO WANTS ANYTHING WITH CHEMICALS IN IT'S BEEN INTERFERED WITH 
IT'S BEEN CREATED BY A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY AND SO IT WILL HAVE A STRING OF SIDE EFFECTS 
I WORKED IT OUT ABOUT TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO THAT TO GET THE MOST AMOUNT OF PAIN RELIEF 
I HAD TO TRY AND GET IT INTO PERSPECTIVE 
WAS IT EASIER TO SMOKE IT OR EASIER TO COOK IT 
HOW DO YOU IS IT SOUP OR TEA 
ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO I STARTED EXPERIMENTING WITH CHOCOLATE 
CAN I HAVE A LOOK 
THAT LOOKS GORGEOUS 
THEY ARE GORGEOUS EACH ONE HAS OH ONE GRAM INSIDE IT 
THAT'S HOW MUCH YOU NEED FIVE TIMES A DAY TO BE PAIN FREE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY AND TO SLEEP 
AND THERE'S NO GRAIN IN IT THERE'S NOTHING IN IT DO YOU SELL THESE 
NO NO I NEVER SELL THEM TO ANYBODY I NEVER HAVE DONE 
YOU'D BE A DEALER THEN WOULDN'T YOU YEAH 
WOULD YOU GIVE ME ONE 
NO I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU ONE BUT WHEN I GO AND GET MY HOT WATER 
IF YOU WANT TO TRY ONE THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS 
BUT I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU ONE YOU WOULDN'T IF YOU STOLE ONE YOU COULD KEEP IT 
I DON'T WANT STOLEN PROPERTY IN MY HOUSE 
CAN YOU EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO TO THE LOO AND I'LL CAME BACK AND GET MY HOT WATER 
O. K. 
YOU GOT THE COURT AGREEMENT 
SO I CAN GET MINE 
AND YOU'LL GET YOURS 
PAT ESCAPED EVICTION THIS TIME BUT WAS GIVEN A WARNING THAT IF SHE'S CAUGHT DEALING OR GROWING AGAIN 
SHE WILL LOSE HER HOME 
SHE CAN ONLY SEE THE GOOD IN CANNABIS BUT IT IS A DRUG JUST LIKE ALCOHOL 
AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE IT CAN DO YOU HARM AND EVEN WORSE DO OTHER PEOPLE HARM 
BACK HERE IN AMSTERDAM I WANT TO FIND OUT WHICH IS WORSE 
CANNABIS OR ALCOHOL WHEN IT COMES TO HARMING OTHERS 
WHERE BETTER TO FIND OUT THAN BEHIND THE WHEEL 
SHALL WE GO ROB SCHMIDT IS A DRIVING INSTRUCTOR 
WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE WHAT'S MORE RISKY TO ME AND OTHER ROAD USERS 
BEING DRUNK OR STONED 
FOR THE TEST I'M GOING TO GET UP TO SEVENTY KILOMETRES PER HOUR 
AND THEN DRIVE FOUR HUNDRED METRES AT A ROW OF BABY DOLLS IN THE ROAD 
WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE ILLUMINATED I HAVE TO SWERVE TO MISS THEM 
FIRST AS A CONTROL I'M DOING IT SOBER MY LAST MINUTE REACTIONS AREN'T TOO BAD 
THAT WAS GREAT 
WHEN NICKY WAS SOBER SHE GOT TO THE RIGHT SPEED SHE BRAKED ON TIME 
STEERED TO THE LEFT ON TIME AND THERE WERE NO BABIES KILLED IN THIS EXPERIMENT 
NEXT THE SAME THING BUT THIS TIME AFTER TWO LARGE DRAGS ON A PIPE CONTAINING HALF A GRAM OF CANNABIS 
I'M CLEARLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE 
MY AIM AS BEFORE IS TO REACH SEVENTY KILOMETRES AN HOUR TO ASSESS HOW QUICK MY REACTIONS WILL BE 
I JUST WANT THIS NIGHTMARE TO END YOU HAVE TO SPEED UP A LITTLE 
BUT I JUST CAN'T DO IT 
IN MY HEAD I FEEL I'M GOING REALLY FAST THAT I'M NEARLY OUT OF CONTROL 
THE REALITY IS DIFFERENT OOH 
MY JUDGEMENT IS TERRIBLE 
GOOD BRAKING 
AFTER THE CANNABIS SHE'S MUCH MORE CAUTIOUS 
SHE'S FRIGHTENED HER SENSE OF RISK DOESN'T MEASURE UP TO THE REAL RISK 
SHE'S A DANGER TO HERSELF 
AND THOSE ON THE ROAD 
NEXT DAY I COME BACK FOR PART THREE 
AND I'M GOING TO DRINK A BOTTLE OF WINE TO TAKE ME THREE TIMES OVER THE LEGAL LIMIT 
OH I THINK I AM JUST 
BEGINNING TO FEEL THE KIND OF WAVE OF THE GRAPE 
IT HAS NUMBED MY BRAIN BUT IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY TO CANNABIS 
BEFORE THE CANNABIS UNLOCKED FEAR NOW I FEEL FEARLESS' 
YOU'RE A VERY HANDSOME MAN 
OOH 
HOW NAUGHTY 
IS THAT O. K. YOU BRAKED O. K. THE BABY'S HEAD HAS FALLEN OFF 
AFTER BOOZE NICKY FEELS LIKE SUPERWOMAN 
SHE THINKS SHE'S IN CONTROL BUT CERTAINLY SHE ISN'T 
THAT MAKES HER OR ANYONE A REALLY DANGEROUS DRIVER 
ACCORDING TO A BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL REPORT THE RISK OF BEING INVOLVED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT 
IS SIX TIMES GREATER WHEN DRUNK AND TWICE AS GREAT ON CANNABIS 
BUT BOTH DRUGS SERIOUSLY IMPAIR YOUR JUDGEMENT 
TURNS OUT THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE DRIVE STONED BUT ONE JOINT EVEN A MILD ONE COULD CAUSE YOU TO HAVE 
A SERIOUS ACCIDENT GET YOU A FIVE ZERO FINE SIX MONTHS IN PRISON 
AND A MINIMUM DISQUALIFICATION OF A YEAR 
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DRIVING 
IT'S ALSO ABOUT HOW OUT OF IT YOU CAN GET I FIND IT SCARY FEELING OUT OF CONTROL 
A DRINKER I KNOW MY LIMITS WITH MY WINE BEER AND SPIRITS 
BUT WITH CANNABIS I HAVE NO IDEA 
NO CLUE WHAT EFFECT IT'S GOING TO HAVE 
BUT BACK IN THE CAFE BABISH THINKS THERE ARE PARALLELS 
I USUALLY COMPARE THEM WITH ALCOHOL COS YOU HAVE WINE OR TEQUILA OR WHISKIES 
THAT WAY YOU CAN SORT OF EXPLAIN A LITTLE EASIER WHAT THE EFFECT IS COS IT DOES VARY A LOT 
DOES IT YEAH IT DOES SO IT IS A BIT LIKE IN A WAY YOU'RE LIKE A. 
CANNABIS CONNOISSEUR LIKE BEING A WINE CONNOISSEUR YEAH EXACTLY 
AND YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES 
YEAH YOU CAN GIVE A VERY GOOD HEADLINE OF WHAT THE EFFECT IS GOING TO BE LIKE 
SO THOSE ONES OVER THERE LOOK LIKE FOR INSTANCE SUPER SILVER WHAT'S THAT SUPER SILVER 
A HEAVY RED WINE REALLY YES 
WE LIKE THE OCEAN'S TWELVE I ALWAYS SAY THAT'S MORE LIKE A GOOD COGNAC 
IT'S CLEAR BUT IT'S PRETTY STRONG 
YOU'RE VERY CHILLED BUT YOU'RE NOT SLEEPY 
AND IF YOU HAVE MORE LIKE A WHISKY LIKE A MAKO HAZE THAT'S A LITTLE HEAVIER 
SO YOU'RE STILL THERE BUT YOU'RE NOT REALLY MOVING AROUND ANY MORE 
WE HAVE ONE THING CALLED ISOLATOR 
AND THAT'S REALLY THE STRONGEST OF THE STRONGEST THAT'S ONLY CRYSTALS PRESSED TOGETHER 
AND THAT IS LIKE A T. H. C. LEVEL OF ALMOST FIFTY TO SIXTY PER CENT WHICH IS REALLY REALLY HIGH 
AND THAT IS DEFINITELY COMPARABLE WITH HALF A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA 
IS IT RUBBISH 
OR IS WHAT SHE SAYS TRUE 
IN A BLIND TEST I'M GOING TO SMOKE TWO JOINTS BOTH CONTAINING 
THE SAME AMOUNT OF CANNABIS BUT ONE SUPPOSEDLY SUPER STRENGTH AND THE OTHER VERY MILD 
WILL I BE ABLE TO TELL THEM APART 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHICH ONE'S COMING FIRST 
I THINK WHAT I'M GOING TO GO FOR IS A MILD HASH TONIGHT 
THE FIRST ONE IS THE KING HUSSAN 
IT'S A VERY NICE ONE 
NICE MILD UPLIFTING A BIT LIKE A GLASS OF WINE KIND OF 
SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD ONE TO START WITH 
I FEEL LIKE MY LIPS ARE STICKING DO MY LIPS LOOK LIKE 
THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER 
YEAH A LITTLE BIT DRY 
THE WHOLE OF THE INSIDE OF MY MOUTH FEELS LIKE IT'S SO DRY 
ON THIS ONE I FEEL LIGHT HEADED TIPSY LIKE HAVING TWO GLASSES OF WINE 
MY REACTION TIME IS NOT TOO BAD 
DID IT AGAIN I JUST FLEXED MY SHOULDERS AND YOU FLINCHED 
O. K. NOW THIS IS THE MALIKA HASH 
THIS IS THE STRONGEST OF THE HASH THAT WE HAVE 
YESTERDAY SHE GOT A MILDER VERSION BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT YET AND THIS IS REALLY THE STRONGEST 
BUT IT'S A HAPPY ONE THOUGH IT'S AN UPLIFTING ONE BUT REALLY REALLY STRONG 
WHO'S GOING TO CARRY HER HOME 
I'M NOT GOING TO CARRY HER 
OH LOOK SHE'S SITTING THERE WAITING 
SHE LOOKS NERVOUS 
ALL RIGHT THAT'S IT 
LET'S GO AND SEE WHAT SHE THINKS 
I'VE MADE YOU A NEW ONE 
IS THIS THE SAME AMOUNT 
EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF CANNABIS 
SAME AMOUNT OF HASH BUT DIFFERENT KIND 
WELL NOTHING FOR THE MOMENT BUT WE DO HAVE TO WAIT 
DEFINITELY WELL NOT WAIT WAIT JUST LET IT HAPPEN 
O. K. I'LL GET YOU A COFFEE 
I REALLY FEEL DIFFERENT FROM YESTERDAY 
OH MY GOODNESS 
WHAT DID YOU PUT IN THAT THING 
HELLO 
YOU FOCUSED 
THIS TIME OH NO MY MUSCLES FEEL VERY HEAVY 
MY MIND IS LIKE TREACLE 
THERE'S A DELAY 
I FEEL BLIND DRUNK AND OUT OF CONTROL 
THE SECOND SPLIFF IS DEFINITELY MUCH STRONGER 
IT MAY NOT BE TOTALLY ACCURATE BUT AT LEAST THEIR MENU IS A GUIDE TO WHAT YOU'RE GETTING 
BYE 
MY MONTH IN AMSTERDAM IS OVER AND IT'S TIME TO LEAVE 
I'M A LOT WISER BUT I AM PUZZLED WHY MY EXPERIENCE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANNABIS HAS BEEN SO VARIED 
FROM FREAKED OUT TO CHILLED OUT 
I'M BACK HOME AND CANNABIS IS IN THE HEADLINES 
HAVE I BEEN PUTTING MYSELF AT MORE RISK THAN I THOUGHT 
REPORTS SUGGEST ONE SPLIFF CAN CAUSE MADNESS 
BACK IN THE THIRTIES THEY WERE SAYING THE SAME THING 
IS IT ALL SCAREMONGERING OR CAN CANNABIS MAKE YOU MAD 
HOW STRONG IS THE EVIDENCE THAT CANNABIS CONTRIBUTES TO PSYCHOSIS 
PROFESSOR ROBIN MURRAY IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF BRITISH RESEARCH INTO IT AT THE INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY 
HI HELLO NICE TO MEET YOU 
I'M QUITE SCARED ABOUT THE HEADLINES I'VE BEEN READING 
THERE'S ONE THAT SAID PSYCHO RISK ONE JOINT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE SCARY HEADLINES 
I THINK PROBABLY THE RISK OF TAKING ONE JOINT AND GOING PSYCHOTIC 
IS THE EQUIVALENT OF TAKING ONE DRINK OF WINE AND BECOMING AN ALCOHOLIC 
SO IT'S NEGLIGABLE IT'S RIDICULOUS CANNABIS TAKEN REGULARLY 
SEVERAL JOINTS A DAY OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS WILL IN FACT INCREASE ONE'S RISK 
UP TO DOUBLING IT 
SOME PEOPLE HAVE A GREATER LIABILITY TO GOING PSYCHOTIC ON CANNABIS 
OTHER PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ABLE TO SMOKE WITHOUT COMING TO ANY GREAT HARM AT ALL 
PEOPLE VARY IN THEIR GENETIC LIABILITY AND THEN 
THERE ARE THE ENVIRONMENT THE SOCIAL FACTORS WHETHER THEY HAVE A REALLY DIFFICULT LIFE 
THESE SORT OF FACTORS ALSO CONTRIBUTE 
BUT CANNABIS MAY ADD TO THESE FACTORS AND TIP THEM OVER THE EDGE INTO PSYCHOSIS 
SO THOUGH LONG TERM USE OF CANNABIS COULD TRIGGER PSYCHOSIS THE MORE LURID HEADLINES ARE WRONG 
BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE NEWSPAPER CLAIMS THAT THE CANNABIS ON OUR STREETS HAS BECOME MUCH STRONGER 
IS THAT TRUE OR NOT 
I'M GOING TO A FORENSIC LAB WHERE DRUGS SEIZED IN POLICE RAIDS END UP 
DOCTOR PHIL YATES IS A FORENSIC DRUGS SCIENTIST AND IS AN EXPERT ON THE CANNABIS SOLD ON BRITAIN'S STREETS 
THIS IS WHERE ITEMS ARE KEPT WHEN WE RECEIVE THEM FROM THE POLICE 
ALL SORTS OF DRUGS IN THERE NOT JUST CANNABIS 
EXACTLY EVERYTHING WE RECEIVE WHATEVER DRUG TYPE 
LITTLE CANNABIS PLANT LEAVES THERE OH YEAH 
AND HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF SOME FLOWERING TOPS WHICH YOU CAN 
HAVE A LOOK DOWN THE MICROSCOPE IF YOU LIKE 
THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE KIND OF BEADS 
YES THAT'S RIGHT AND THOSE ARE WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE RESIN GLANDS 
AND IF YOU LOOK AT IT UNDER A HIGHER POWERED MICROSCOPE THAT'S WHAT THEY USUALLY LOOK LIKE 
THEY LOOK A BIT LIKE MUSHROOMS 
YOU'VE GOT THE STALK WITH A LITTLE SORT OF DUMPY DOUGHNUT SHAPED THING ON THE TOP 
AND THEY CONTAIN THE DRUG 
WHAT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW IS IS IT STRONGER THAN IT USED TO BE 
WELL THE SHORT ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS YES 
THE MAJORITY OF THE CANNABIS THAT WE SEE HERE IN THE U. K. THESE DAYS IS THE HOME GROWN GENETICALLY ALTERED TYPE 
WHICH CAN CONTAIN TEN TO FIFTEEN PER CENT T. H. C. TYPICALLY 
IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE NATURALLY GROWN CANNABIS THAT WOULD BE IMPORTED FROM ABROAD 
THAT WOULD TYPICALLY CONTAIN THREE TO FIVE PER CENT T. H. C. 
SO IN COMPARISON IT'S THREE TO FOUR TIMES STRONGER 
A WORRYING TREND THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO IN THE U. K. 
IS CANNABIS TOPS WHICH HAVE BEEN ADULTERATED WITH TINY GLASS BEADS 
AND IF YOU IMAGINE YOU'RE INHALING TINY RED HOT BEADS INTO YOUR LUNGS I'M SURE IT CAN'T DO YOU ANY GOOD 
WITH CANNABIS PRODUCTION IN THE HANDS OF CRIMINALS 
IT'S NO SURPRISE THEY ADD GLASS BALLS TO MAKE THEIR DOPE LOOK STRONGER 
SO WHILST FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE MAY ENJOY CANNABIS DO THEY REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING 
THREE CANNABIS FARMS ARE RAIDED EVERY DAY IN BRITAIN 
SKUNK WHICH IS CANNABIS GROWN SPECIFICALLY FOR IT'S HIGH T. H. C. IS ON THE RISE 
THERE'S NOW SO MUCH GROWN HERE THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME BRITAIN IS EXPORTING THE DRUG 
OUT ON THE STREET PEOPLE ALSO THINK IT'S GETTING STRONGER AND THAT IT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS 
SKUNK IS A VERY POWERFUL DRUG 
DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU ALL THE THINGS IT DOES TO ME SERIOUSLY YEAH TELL ME 
LIKE I'M IN MY HOUSE AND I HEAR A HELICOPTER AND I'M LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW 
IT DOES ALL THIS MADNESS TO ME IT MAKES ME PARANOID TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS 
SOMETIMES I CAN JUST BE NORMAL LIKE SMOKE IT AND I'M VERY HAPPY 
AND THEN AFTER MY MUM MIGHT SAY SOMETHING LIKE RICH 
AND I'LL BE LIKE WHAT WHAT 
SO LIKE THAT'S ALL THE THINGS IT DOES TO YOU SERIOUSLY 
YOU GO MENTAL IF YOU'RE THIRTEEN OR YOUNGER STAY AWAY FROM IT UNTIL YOU'RE TWENTY ONE OR SOMETHING 
UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT IT ACTUALLY 
COS ALL THE THIRTEEN YEAR OLD KIDS ON THE STREETS THESE DAYS ARE WALKING AROUND BIG ONES LIKE 
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S DOING TO THEIR BRAINS 
IT'S STRONGER THAN IT USED TO BE COS IT'S GOT TOO MUCH CHEMICALS ADDED TO IT 
IT FUCKS UP YOUR HEAD AND YOU LOSE MEMORY IN YOUR HEAD 
BUT ARE THESE VIEWS RIGHT 
IS IT REALLY TRUE THAT THE SKUNK OUT THERE CAN PLAY HAVOC WITH YOUR MIND 
HERE AT THE INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY I'VE AGREED TO TAKE PART 
IN A UNIQUE MEDICAL TRIAL DESIGNED TO FIND OUT 
IT'S PART OF THEIR ON GOING RESEARCH INTO THE LINK BETWEEN STRONGER CANNABIS AND PSYCHOSIS 
THE SCIENTISTS ARE INTERESTED IN THE EFFECTS OF THE RATIO BETWEEN THE TWO MAIN COMPONENTS OF CANNABIS 
T. H. C. AND CANNABINOID 
SO ON ONE DAY I'M BEING INJECTED WITH PURE T. H. C. 
SOMETHING LIKE ULTRA HIGH POTENCY SKUNK 
ON THE OTHER DAY I GET A MIXTURE OF T. H. C. AND CANNABINOID 
MORE LIKE THE NATURAL MAKE UP OF THE CANNABIS PLANT 
WHEN I GET THE INJECTIONS I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM GETTING 
IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS ONE IS THE MIXTURE OF T. H. C. AND CANNABINOID 
AFTER TEN MINUTES IT HITS ME 
WITH THE T. H. C. AND CANNABINOID NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY TO TAKE THE EXPERIMENT SERIOUSLY 
IT ALL SEEMS HILARIOUS' 
SO SERIOUS 
I'LL GET YOU SOMETHING A BIT SOFTER THAN THAT 
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE 
IT LOOKS VERY ENJOYABLE 
MY GOD IT'S FUN 
IT WAS AMAZING 
AMAZING 
WITH THE PURE T. H. C. IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY 
IT'S HORRIBLE 
IT'S LIKE BEING 
AT A FUNERAL 
WORSE IT SORT OF LIKE 
YOU'D WANT TO UM TOP YOURSELF 
AFTER FIFTEEN MINUTES I BEGIN A SERIES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS DESIGNED TO 
MEASURE WHETHER I'VE BECOME PSYCHOTIC AND IF SO HOW SEVERELY 
DO I FEEL AGITATED NO 
ON THE T. H. C. AND CANNABINOID MIXTURE I SEEM REALLY FLIPPANT 
ON THIS DRUG I JUST DON'T CARE 
I'M EXPERIENCING PROFOUND INSIGHTS 
BOLLOCKS I'M WORRIED MY STATE OF MIND WON'T END 
I DON'T WANT IT TO END 
THIS EXPERIENCE IS FRIGHTENING STRONG 
I FEEL AGITATED 
YEAH I DO 
BUT WITH THE PURE T. H. C. I'M SUSPICIOUS INTROVERTED WEIRD 
EVERY QUESTION SEEMS TO HAVE A DOUBLE MEANING 
THE TROUBLE IS MY ATTENTION IS REALLY LIKE REALLY 
MASSIVELY INTO 
JUST A WORD OR 
BUT NOT IN A HAPPY 
IT'S LIKE A MORBID MORBID 
THAT'S HOW I FEEL 
MORBID 
IT'S AN ANXIETY LIKE IN A PANIC ATTACK 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT'S LIKE 
YOU ASK ME A QUESTION I'M THINKING I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER 
I'M JUST ONE OF MANY VOLUNTEERS TAKING PART IN THIS TRIAL 
THE DOCTORS ARE HOPING TO ANSWER SOME REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS 
ABOUT CANNABIS AND PSYCHOSIS 
FOR EXAMPLE DO PEOPLE REACT DIFFERENTLY 
TO EXACTLY THE SAME DOSE OF T. H. C. 
AND CAN CANNABINOID REDUCE THE PSYCHOTIC EFFECT OF T. H. C. 
IT CERTAINLY MADE ME UNCONTROLLABLY GIGGLY 
TWO HOURS LATER THE EFFECTS HAVE WORN OFF 
SO JUST HOW PSYCHOTIC DID I GET THE PSYCHIATRISTS USE A STANDARD TEST 
WHICH MEASURES CHANGES IN PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS 
ON THE FIRST DAY YOU SCORED ONE 
YOUR CHANGE FROM BASELINE TO THE PEAK EXPERIENCE WAS ONE 
WHICH IS INSIGNIFICANT 
ABOVE FOUR IS THOUGHT TO BE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT 
ABOVE FOUR WOULD BE 
WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT IN SCHIZOPHRENIC PSYCHOSIS 
AND YOU SCORED FOURTEEN ON THE SECOND DAY 
SO YOU WERE REALLY 
PERSECUTED REALLY IT FELT QUITE UNPLEASANT 
I SCORED FOURTEEN 
AN INCREASE OF FOURTEEN POINTS ON PURE T. H. C. WAS VERY HIGH AND SUGGESTS 
THAT THE NEW BREEDS OF SKUNK CAN PLAY HAVOC WITH YOUR MIND BUT WITH NO HISTORY 
OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND NO PREDISPOSITION TO SCHIZOPHRENIA I WAS AT NO LONG TERM RISK 
THE REAL WORRY IS FOR HEAVY USERS OF SKUNK 
ONE PERSON WITH FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE IS J. ROCK LEAD RAPPER OF THE HIP HOP BAND BIG BROVAZ 
HE DECIDED TO GO PUBLIC ABOUT HIS NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE ON WEED 
OVER TIME I WOULD SAY I BECAME SUPER PARANOID CONSTANTLY 
AND WITH THE FAME IT MADE THINGS EVEN WORSE 
WHEN PEOPLE WOULD COME UP TO ME AND ASK ME FOR AN AUTOGRAPH 
I'D THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE A TRICK UP THEIR SLEEVE OR SOMETHING 
THEY WANTED TO ROB ME OR FIGHT ME WHATEVER THE SITUATION 
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE IN MYSELF ANY MORE YOU KNOW 
SO I DECIDED TO STOP SMOKING 
AND I'M NOT SAYING IT'S ANYTHING LIKE CRACK COCAINE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A HARD DRUG 
BUT OVER TIME AND THROUGH EXCESS IT'S REALLY DULLING YOUR BRAIN CELLS 
IT'S REALLY LIMITING YOUR ADVANCEMENT 
THE RESEARCH AT THE INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY 
IS BEGINNING TO UNRAVEL THE WAY CANNABIS REALLY WORKS ON THE MIND 
WHAT'S BECOME CLEAR TO ME IS THAT THERE ARE A WHOLE RANGE OF VARIETIES 
AND DIFFERENT STRENGTHS OF CANNABIS OUT THERE AND THEY CAN HAVE WILDLY DIFFERENT EFFECTS 
YOU HAVE THE PRO CANNABIS LOBBY WHO SAY CANNABIS IS A SACRED BOON TO MANKIND 
IT HAS NO ADVERSE EFFECTS IT'S HARDLY EVEN A DRUG 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL ENHANCE YOUR LIFE 
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE PROTAGONISTS OR THE PROHIBITIONISTS 
WHO THINK IT'S THE DEVIL'S CONSTRUCTION 
CANNABIS AS YOU SAY ONE PUFF AND YOU GO MAD 
EACH OF THESE ARE EQUALLY RIDICULOUS 
AND I THINK THAT HAS BEEN THE DIFFICULTY THAT SOMEHOW 
THERE'S BEEN AN IDEOLOGICAL DISPUTE AND RELATIVELY LITTLE RESEARCH 
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT CANNABIS LIKE ALCOHOL IS A POTENT DRUG 
WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THE DEBATE ABOUT THE TOUGHENING UP OF THE ANTI CANNABIS LAWS 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE STILL GOING TO USE IT 
THE SCARY THING IS THAT UNLIKE AMSTERDAM MANY PEOPLE HERE 
JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE BUYING AND THE RISKS THEY'RE TAKING 
SO I'VE COME TO MY CONCLUSION 
STREET SKUNK IS DEFINITELY OFF MY MENU 
I'M BACK TO MY DRUG OF CHOICE
