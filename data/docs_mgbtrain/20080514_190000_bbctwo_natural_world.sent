THE OPEN OCEAN 
AS ALIEN TO US AS SPACE 
A WORLD CRISS CROSSED BY LONG DISTANCE TRAVELLERS 
IN SEARCH OF FOOD 
ONE GROUP IS FASTER THAN ALL THE OTHERS 
AND IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE CREATURES WE KNOW LEAST ABOUT 
MARLIN SWORDFISH SAILFISH COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS BILLFISH 
ARE AMONG THE MOST POWERFUL FISH IN THE WORLD 
SOME WEIGH OVER HALF A TONNE AND CAN TRAVEL AT FIFTY M. P. H. 
IT'S WHY SPORT FISHERMEN SEEK THEM OUT AS THE ULTIMATE ADRENALIN RUSH 
MOST PEOPLE HAVE ONLY EVER SEEN THEM ON THE END OF A FISHING LINE 
THEY'VE INSPIRED MARINE BIOLOGIST AND CAMERAMAN RICK ROSENTHAL 
IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY 
OF ALL THE FISH IN THE SEA THE BILLFISH REALLY EXCITE ME 
MAYBE IT'S THEIR POWER THEIR SPEED AND ANATOMY 
AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ARMED AND DANGEROUS 
I DON'T WANT TO CATCH THEM WITH A HOOK AND LINE 
BUT I DO WANT TO TAKE THEIR PICTURE 
HE'S ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE PREPARED TO GET UNDERWATER WITH THEM 
RICK HAS SPENT MOST OF HIS ADULT LIFE FILMING OCEAN WILDLIFE 
BUT BILLFISH WILL BE ONE OF HIS GREATEST CHALLENGES 
IT WILL TAKE TWO YEARS 
VENTURING INTO SOME OF THE MOST DANGEROUS AND UNPREDICTABLE PLACES 
ON THE HIGH SEAS 
FOR HIM TO TELL THE STORY OF THESE REMARKABLE FISH 
THE ELONGATED UPPER JAWBONE OF MARLIN SWORDFISH SAILFISH 
PROBABLY EVOLVED FOR SELF DEFENCE 
BUT IT'S STILL A POTENTIALLY LETHAL WEAPON 
THE FIRST TIME RICK GOT IN THE WATER WITH BILLFISH 
THE REST OF THE CREW DOUBTED HE'D MAKE IT BACK OUT 
THE CAPTAIN WAS FRIGHTENED TO DEATH THAT I'M GOING TO GET SKEWERED 
THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO GO IN 
I WAS GOING FOR IT I GRABBED THE BIG CAMERA AND STARTED SWIMMING 
AND IN THE BLUE YOU SEE THINGS YOU SEE GHOSTS OUT THERE IN THE DISTANCE 
AND WHEN I GOT RIGHT INTO THE SCENE 
TWENTY THIRTY MARLINS FEEDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME ON SARDINES IT WAS A BALLET 
IT WAS EVERYTHING THE BIRDS WERE DIVING WHEN YOU SWIM BACK 
WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THE BOAT WITH THAT KIND OF FEELING YOU'RE HOOKED 
NOT ONLY DID RICK SURVIVE 
HIS PASSION TO GET CLOSE TO BILLFISH DREW HIM FURTHER AND FURTHER 
INTO THE OPEN OCEAN 
OUT IN THIS LIQUID DESERT CREATURES ARE HARD TO FIND LET ALONE FILM 
MOST ELUSIVE OF ALL ARE THESE SWORD WIELDING GIANTS 
THEIR HIGHLY MUSCLED BODIES AND SICKLE SHAPED TAILS 
PROPEL THEM THOUSANDS OF MILES ACROSS REMOTE OCEAN 
MOST OF THE GREAT BILLFISH PLACES IT'S ROUGH 
AND THOSE FISH ARE OUT IN THE BIG ROUGH TOUGH OCEAN 
THEY'RE NOT ON A REEF THEY'RE NOT SWIMMING AROUND IN A NICE BAY 
THEY'RE OUT IN THE BIG WATER AND YOU HAVE TO GO AND PURSUE THEM 
AND MOST OF THE TIME WE CAN'T EVEN GET CLOSE TO THEM 
BECAUSE WE CAN'T CATCH UP WITH THEM 
ONE FLICK OF THEIR TAIL AND THEY'RE GONE 
RICK'S JOURNEY BEGINS THIRTY MILES OFF THE COAST OF MEXICO 
WHERE A RICH RIBBON OF CURRENT MAY OR MAY NOT DRAW IN MARLIN 
PAST EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS HIS BEST BET IS TO FOLLOW A POD OF DOLPHINS 
THEY AT LEAST ARE VISIBLE AND MAY PROVIDE EARLY CLUES 
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON UNDER THE SURFACE 
MUCH OF THE OCEAN IS BARREN BUT HERE SHOALS OF SARDINES AND MACKEREL 
ARE SWEPT ALONG ON THE POWERFUL CALIFORNIA CURRENT 
THE SHOALS ATTEMPT TO REMAIN HIDDEN WHILE PREDATORS TRY TO TRACK THEM 
THE POD IS ON THE CHASE 
THE SIGNAL RICK'S BEEN WAITING FOR 
ALONG THIS CURRENT DOLPHINS ARE FREQUENTLY FOLLOWED BY LARGE TUNA 
THEY ARE ALSO HUNTING DOWN THE SARDINES AND MACKEREL 
THERE'S A CHANCE STRIPED MARLIN WILL BE DOWN THERE TOO 
BUT IF RICK JUMPS IN TOO SOON HE'LL BE LEFT BEHIND 
AS ALL THE PREDATORS CLOSE IN THE BAIT FISH PANIC 
AND HUDDLE TOGETHER IN AN EVER SMALLER AREA OF OCEAN 
TO BE HERE AND SEE THESE DOLPHINS ON THE RUN 
CHASING FISH AND THE TUNA EXPLODING OUT OF THE WATER 
SOMETIMES EIGHT TEN FEET IN THE AIR CATCHING FLYING FISH AND SARDINES 
YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE MARLIN FOOD PATCH 
THE MARLIN ONLY REVEAL THEMSELVES 
WHEN A PART OF THE BAIT SHOAL SPLINTERS OFF 
THERE'S INDIGO BLUE FINS IN THE WATER CIRCLING 
A BIG SLASHING MARLIN UP ON THE SURFACE 
THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT SPOT YOU'VE FOUND THE SHOW 
RICK CAN'T WEAR SCUBA GEAR BECAUSE THE BUBBLES FRIGHTEN THE ANIMALS 
HE WILL HAVE TO HOLD HIS BREATH 
THE TWELVE FOOT FOUR HUNDRED POUND MARLIN CORRAL THE BAIT UP AGAINST THE SURFACE 
WHILE THEY SLASH THROUGH THIS BAIT BALL 
RICK MAY HAVE ONLY A FEW MINUTES TO FILM THEM 
THERE'S A DANGEROUSLY FINE LINE BETWEEN GETTING CLOSE TO THE ACTION 
AND BECOMING PART OF IT 
THOSE SMALL BAIT FISH SEE YOU AND THEY SWARM AROUND YOU FOR PROTECTION 
TO GET AWAY FROM THE PREDATOR 
AND IT'S PRETTY UNNERVING I CAN'T SEE ANY MORE 
IT'S DARK IN THERE IT'S LIGHTS OUT 
IF RICK DIDN'T STAY CALM 
HE WOULDN'T RECORD THE EXTRAORDINARY SCENES THAT APPEAR 
A HERD OF SEA LIONS HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO THE COMMOTION 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME RICK HAS SEEN THEM FEEDING ALONGSIDE BILLFISH 
THESE VERY DIFFERENT ANIMALS 
MAY HAVE COME FROM EITHER END OF THIS POWERFUL HIGHWAY OF CURRENT 
BUT THEY'VE MORE IN COMMON THAN IT MIGHT SEEM 
A LITTLE LIKE THE SEA LION MARLIN CAN REGULATE BODY TEMPERATURE 
SPECIAL MUSCLES IN ITS HEAD KEEP BRAIN AND EYES WARM AND ALERT 
IT MAKES THEM FAST AND EFFICIENT 
AND GIVES THEM THE EDGE OVER MOST OTHER PREDATORY FISH 
IN THIS RESPECT A BILLFISH IS MORE LIKE A MAMMAL THAN A FISH 
MOST DAYS RICK WON'T EVEN SEE BILLFISH 
SO THIS HAS BEEN AN EXCEPTIONAL MEETING 
THE RESULT OF SEVERAL WEEKS' SEARCHING OVER THE DEEP SEA 
THERE AREN'T MANY PLACES IN THE WORLD 
WHERE BILLFISH VISIT SHALLOWER WATER 
BUT WHERE THE WATERS OF THE ATLANTIC BECOME COMPRESSED 
INTO THE CARIBBEAN BASIN THERE IS ONE SUCH PLACE 
RICK HAS HEARD RUMOURS FROM SPORT FISHERMEN 
ABOUT A NEWLY DISCOVERED EVENT 
AN ANNUAL GATHERING OF MIGRATING SAILFISH 
EVEN IF RICK GETS THE MOON PHASE AND TIDES JUST RIGHT 
HE KNOWS THERE'S NO GUARANTEE HE'LL FIND THEM 
WHICH IS WHY HE NEEDS THE HELP OF THESE FRIGATE BIRDS 
THERE'S MORE FRIGATE BIRDS HERE 
THAN MOST PLACES WE'LL SEE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD 
THIS IS THE LARGEST GATHERING OF FRIGATE BIRDS IN THE WHOLE CARIBBEAN 
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE IN THE NESTING SEASON 
AND THEY EAT A LOT OF FISH THEY REQUIRE A LOT OF PROTEIN 
AND FOR THEM TO BE HERE AND ROOST AND NEST AND FEED THEIR YOUNG 
DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY THERE HAS TO BE A LOT OF FOOD OUT THERE 
AND THAT FOOD THE SARDINES 
IS THE SAME FOOD THAT THE SAILFISH ARE EATING AS WELL 
EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE ALL THIS MODERN TECHNOLOGY WE STILL RELY ON 
SOME OF THOSE OLD TELL TALE SIGNS LIKE SEABIRDS HOVERING OVERHEAD 
A DISTANT DOLPHIN BLOW A SPLASH TO TAKE US TO THE ACTION 
AT OTHER TIMES WE LOOK FOR CONVERGING CURRENTS 
AND WE SEE THOSE FROM COLOURATION CHANGES IN THE WATER 
OR MAYBE YOU ALMOST SEE WAVES ON ONE SIDE OF A CURRENT LINE 
AND THE OTHER IT'LL BE SMOOTH WATER 
YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR WHAT WE CALL THE SEA WIND 
AND WHEN WE FIND THOSE CONVERGENT LINES 
THOSE ARE HIGHWAYS THAT TAKE US TO ACTIVITY 
RICK'S FAITH IN THE FRIGATE BIRDS PAYS OFF 
THEY TAKE HIM TO A LINE OF SARGASSUM WEED 
BECALMED BETWEEN TWO CONVERGING CURRENTS 
PLANKTON ALSO GETS TRAPPED 
WHICH IS WHY THERE ARE SMALL FISH IN ABUNDANCE 
IT'S ALSO WHY PREDATORS SUCH AS MOBULA RAYS 
HUNT ALONG GREAT DIVIDES LIKE THIS WHERE WARM WATER MEETS COLD 
I CAN FEEL THE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE 
ONE SIDE OF MY BODY IS WARM 
AND THE OTHER SIDE IS COLD THIS MUST BE WHAT A FISH FEELS 
THE RAYS THEY SWIM IN AND OUT OF THAT CURRENT LINE 
THEY SEEM TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE IS 
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS SAILFISH HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR TOO 
SAILFISH ARE SMALLER THAN MARLIN 
BUT THEY ARE STILL LARGER THAN A MAN 
WHAT REALLY MARKS THEM OUT FROM OTHER BILLFISH IS THEIR EXTENDABLE 
DORSAL FIN WHICH LIKE A SAIL THEY CAN RAISE OR LOWER AT WILL 
SAILFISH LIKE MOST BILLFISH ARE USUALLY SOLITARY HUNTERS 
SO RICK IS AMAZED AS MORE AND MORE SAILFISH SWIM INTO VIEW 
THOUSANDS OF THEM HAVE CONGREGATED OVER A TWENTY MILE STRETCH OF OCEAN 
FOR ONCE THE FISHERMEN'S TALES WERE TRUE 
THIS IS A REAL SPECIAL MOMENT 
TO GET IN CLOSE TO ALL THESE BILLFISH 
FEEDING TOGETHER CHANGING COLOURS 
THERE'S MORE SAILFISH IN A GROUP THAN I'VE EVER SEEN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD 
SARDINES HAVE LITTLE CHANCE AGAINST THE ATHLETIC AND AGILE SAILFISH 
THEY CAN BOTH MANOEUVRE SHARPLY AND HOVER IN THE WATER 
THANKS TO THEIR LONG WING LIKE PELVIC FINS 
WHEN SAILFISH GET EXCITED THEIR SKIN CHANGES FROM SILVER TO BLACK 
THEY ALSO RAISE THEIR DORSAL FIN 
WHICH MAKES THEM LOOK TWICE THEIR SIZE 
THEY SEEM TO USE IT LIKE A MATADOR'S CAPE 
TO CONFUSE AND HERD THEIR PREY 
THEY'VE COME HERE TO FEED 
BUT WHETHER THIS AGGREGATION IS ALSO A PRELUDE TO MATING NO ONE KNOWS 
TO ME THEY'RE THE ULTIMATE MORE THAN A SHARK 
SHARKS THEY CLACK THEIR TEETH 
AND GIVE BODY LANGUAGE AND DO THOSE KIND OF THINGS 
THE BILLFISH CHANGES COLOUR IN FRONT OF YOU LIKE A CHAMELEON IN SECONDS 
WE HARDLY KNOW ANY OTHER ANIMALS THAT DO THAT EXCEPT THE SQUID 
BEFORE YOUR EYES THEY CHANGE COLOUR 
THEY'RE LIGHTING UP GOING DARK 
THE FINS ARE EXTENDED THE DORSAL FIN IS UP LIKE A CAPE 
IT'S MAGIC 
JUST AS BLUSHING AND GOOSEBUMPS REVEAL HUMAN EMOTIONS 
THE SKIN OF BILLFISH MAY EXPRESS THEIR MOOD 
WHEN EXCITED THE TAIL AND PECTORAL FINS 
OF A STRIPED MARLIN FLUSH VIBRANT BLUE 
A WHITE MARLIN'S BELLY 
SHIMMERS RAINBOW HUES WHEN THE FISH IS AGITATED 
BUT THE REST OF THEIR LIVES REMAINS A CLOSED BOOK 
THEIR LIFE HISTORY IS SUCH A MYSTERY 
BECAUSE WE CAN'T GO WITH THEM WE CAN'T FOLLOW THEM 
WE DON'T SEE 'EM ALONG THE SHORELINE OFTEN 
AND THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT 
FOR SCIENTISTS AND BIOLOGISTS TO STUDY THEM 
YOU READ THE BOOKS THE MAGAZINES YOU TALK TO THE SCIENTISTS 
THEY'RE STILL SCRATCHING THEIR HEAD 
THEY KNOW VERY LITTLE 
INDEED THIS PRIVILEGED VIEW OF THEM 
IS A CONSEQUENCE OF RICK'S EXPERIENCE 
IT'S ENABLED HIM TO GET CLOSE TO THE SMALLER TYPES OF BILLFISH 
BUT THERE'S ONE BILLFISH THAT GROWS TO ENORMOUS PROPORTIONS 
ONE RICK HAS FANTASIZED ABOUT SINCE HE WAS TWELVE 
WHEN HE FIRST READ A CLASSIC TALE OF THE OCEAN BY ERNEST HEMINGWAY 
IN THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA AN AGEING CUBAN FISHERMAN CATCHES 
BUT IS ULTIMATELY HUMBLED BY A GIANT MARLIN 
AS A BOY I READ HEMINGWAY 
AND I READ EVERYTHING I COULD ABOUT THE OCEAN AND THE OUTDOORS 
AND I THOUGHT WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE TO SEE A FISH 
THE SIZE THAT HEMINGWAY DESCRIBED IN THAT BOOK 
AND YOU KNOW EVEN BETTER WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE TO SWIM WITH ONE OF THOSE 
MANY FISHERMEN WANT TO WRESTLE ONE OUT OF THE SEA 
A BLUE OR BLACK MARLIN OVER ONE THOUSAND POUNDS 
KNOWN AS A GRANDER 
IS THE HOLY GRAIL OF SPORT FISHING 
TO CATCH ONE ANGLERS HAVE GONE TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH 
THERE IS A PLACE WHERE A FEW DECADES AGO RICK COULD HAVE 
FULFILLED HIS BOYHOOD DREAM BUT OTHERS FOUND IT FIRST 
OFF PERU THE COLD HUMBOLDT CURRENT MEETS WARM EQUATORIAL WATER 
THEIR COLLISION CREATES A BIOLOGICAL HOTSPOT 
THERE IS BARELY A LIVING TO BE MADE FROM THE LAND 
BUT THE RICH WATER JUST OFFSHORE 
SUPPORTS A HUGE FLOTILLA OF FISHERMEN 
ONCE THIS STRETCH OF COASTLINE WAS DUBBED MARLIN BOULEVARD 
AT THE VILLAGE OF CABO BLANCO RICK MIGHT HAVE SEEN FISH WEIGHING 
OVER ONE THOUSAND POUNDS JUST A FEW HUNDRED METRES FROM THE BEACH 
IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES CABO BLANCO'S REPUTATION 
AS A GRANDER GOLDMINE ATTRACTED SPORTSMEN AND CELEBRITIES ALIKE 
HEMINGWAY STAYED FOR ONE MONTH 
BUT NO ONE LANDED MORE OF THE ONE THOUSAND POUND FISH 
THAN TEXAS OILMAN ALFRED GLASSELL 
HE BROUGHT HIS BOAT THE MISS TEXAS ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM NOVA SCOTIA 
WHERE SHE'D BEEN CUSTOM BUILT 
GOOD LORD THERE'S NO END TO HIM 
A BIG MEAN MAGNIFICENT FISH 
BENT ON TEARING UP THE OCEAN 
AT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY POUNDS 
IT WAS THE BIGGEST GAME FISH EVER TAKEN BY ROD AND REEL 
HE DESCRIBED HIS GIANT TROPHY AS MALE 
BUT ALL MARLIN OVER FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS ARE FEMALE 
ARGUABLY THE GAME FISH RECORD HOLDER IS FEMALE AS WELL 
KIMBERLY WISS CAUGHT A LARGER MARLIN THAN GLASSELL 
BUT ONCE UPSIDE DOWN ON THE SCALES 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY POUNDS OF SQUID SLID OUT OF ITS MOUTH 
AND THE RECORD SLIPPED THROUGH KIMBERLY'S FINGERS 
THE PATH TO THE EXCLUSIVE CABO BLANCO FISHING CLUB 
WAS ONCE LINED WITH MARLIN TAILS 
IN THOSE DAYS THE DESIRE TO REEL IN THESE HUGE TROPHY FISH WAS GREATER 
THAN ANY SENSE OF HOW LIMITED THE OCEAN'S RESOURCES MIGHT BE 
SIXTY YEARS ON THE GRANDER GOLD RUSH IS OVER 
I HAVE MIXED EMOTIONS WHEN I WALK TO THE OLD CLUB HOUSE 
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE BEEN THERE 
THAT TIME WHEN IT WAS REAL EXCITEMENT 
KNOWING THAT THERE WAS BIG FISH OUT THERE SWIMMING 
EVEN CLOSE TO THE BEACH THAT THE OCEAN WAS PROBABLY BOUNDLESS 
THAT THERE WAS LOTS OF FOOD 
ON THE OTHER HAND 
WHAT WE KNOW TODAY IS THAT THOSE GIANTS MAY BE JUST GHOSTS 
THE SPORT FISHING BONANZA DIDN'T LAST 
BECAUSE COMMERCIAL FISHING BOATS MOVED IN 
NOT ONLY HAVE THEY EMPTIED THESE WATERS OF THE BIGGEST MARLIN 
BUT THEY'VE STARTED TO UNDERMINE THE MARLIN'S FOOD SUPPLY AS WELL 
THIS IS THE HEART OF THE HUMBOLDT SQUID FISHERY 
SQUID LIVE DEEP 
BUT AT NIGHT THEY TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF FEET UPWARDS TO FEED 
LOCALLY THEY'RE KNOWN AS RED DEVILS 
CATCHING THEM IS BRUTAL WORK 
THEY ARE MAN SIZED AND HAVE POWERFUL BEAKS 
THIS IS REALLY A WILD FISHERY OUT HERE 
HERE COMES A SQUID IT'S HOLDING ONTO A LURE A JIG 
LOOK AT HIM JET LIKE A BIG FIRE HOSE 
WHAT AN IMPRESSIVE ANIMAL 
BUT EVERYTHING IS EATING THESE SQUIDS THE WHALES 
THE BIG FISH AND THE BIG BLACK MARLIN 
THE WORLD RECORD MARLIN THEY CAUGHT HERE 
YEARS AGO THEY'RE EATING THESE SQUIDS 
IT'S REALLY AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE 
MAYBE ONE REASON THAT THE MARLIN ARE DISAPPEARING 
DAWN ON THE DOCKS REVEALS ONE NIGHT'S DEVASTATION 
HUNDREDS OF SMALL BOATS 
EACH UNLOADING SIX TONNES OF SQUID FROM THE HOLD 
THE FISHERMEN GET A PITIFUL RETURN FROM THEIR GRUELLING NIGHT'S WORK 
AND YET THE HUMBOLDT CURRENT IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE LOCAL ECONOMY 
IT HAS YIELDED NEARLY ONE FIFTH OF THE OCEAN'S TOTAL CATCH 
AND THE CLOCK NEVER STOPS 
AS THE NIGHT SHIFT COMES IN THE DAY SHIFT GOES OUT 
THEY WILL RETURN WITH A MOUNTAIN OF ANCHOVIES 
THIS IS THE FISH THAT UNDERPINS THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM 
AND YET IT'S SOLD IN VOLUME 
TO MAKE FISHMEAL FOR LIVESTOCK FEED AND FERTILIZER 
CHEAP PROTEIN FOR OUR PIGS AND GARDENS 
COMES AT A TERRIBLE PRICE TO THE OCEAN 
WHAT IS LEFT FOR THE BILLFISH 
THE MARINE FOOD CHAIN IS SO DEPLETED 
THAT ONLY SMALL BILLFISH ARE CAUGHT THESE DAYS 
THE STORY IS REPEATED IN ALL THE SEAPORTS 
THAT LINE THE HUMBOLDT CURRENT 
A RELENTLESS HARVEST DRIVEN BY LOCAL POVERTY AND CONSUMER GREED 
UNBELIEVABLE BILLFISH AFTER BILLFISH 
MARLIN SAILFISH SWORDFISH DORADO MAHI MAHI WAHOO SHARKS 
THE WHOLE PELAGIC SYSTEM 
BOAT AFTER BOAT UNLOADING ON THIS BEACH 
TO BE TAKEN AWAY BY TRUCK AND PUT ON THE PLANE 
AND MOST OF IT GOING TO THE UNITED STATES 
CONSUMERS SHOULD BEWARE 
A CENTURY OF INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION 
HAS CONTAMINATED THE ENTIRE MARINE FOOD CHAIN 
MERCURY CONCENTRATES IN TOXIC LEVELS IN TOP PREDATORS LIKE MARLIN 
TUNA AND SWORDFISH 
EXCEPT IN SMALL QUANTITIES THIS FISH IS UNSAFE 
RICK IS ALSO TROUBLED THAT MUCH OF THE BILLFISH CATCH 
IS NOT BEING STORED ON ICE 
THE MEAT DEGRADES QUICKLY IN THIS HEAT 
IT MEANS THAT A MAGNIFICENT FISH WILL END UP AS VERY LOW GRADE FOOD 
THE SHEER TONNAGE OF FISH BEING HOISTED OUT OF THE SEAS 
EVERY DAY IS SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE 
WHEN YOU SEE A SCENE LIKE THIS 
YOU REALLY GET THE IDEA OF HOW THIS CAN'T CONTINUE 
WHY THERE'S SUCH A SHORTAGE OF FISH IN THE OCEAN 
THE DEMAND IS JUST SO INSATIABLE 
THIS IS WHY WE'RE IN TROUBLE 
THESE MARLIN POPULATIONS WON'T RECOVER 
IF WE KEEP TAKING THE BIG EGG BEARING FEMALES 
SPORT FISHERMEN TOOK HUNDREDS 
BUT COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN NOW TAKE THOUSANDS 
IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS OVER NINETY PER CENT OF ALL BILLFISH HAVE BEEN KILLED 
BUT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO BRING THEM BACK FROM THE BRINK 
THE BROADBILLED SWORDFISH ONCE HUNTED TO NEAR EXTINCTION HAS MADE 
AN UNLIKELY COMEBACK THANKS TO SOME POWERFUL ALLIES IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA 
SEVERAL YEARS AGO SPORT FISHING GROUPS LOBBIED THE U. S. GOVERNMENT 
TO BAN COMMERCIAL LONG LINING OF SWORDFISH 
AND NUMBERS HAVE RECOVERED 
SPORT FISHERMEN NOW SUPPORT SCIENTISTS 
TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THEM 
BUT THIS IS NOT AN EASY FISH TO STUDY 
SO THIS BILL CAME OFF OF A FOUR HUNDRED POUND SWORDFISH SWIMMING AT FIFTY M. P. H. 
THAT'S ONE POWERFUL ANIMAL 
IF YOU HAVE TO ATTACK SOMETHING 
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO HAVE ON THE END OF YOUR NOSE 
YOUR UPPER JAW ONE BIG BILL THAT CAN CUT THROUGH THE WATER 
OR RUN ANOTHER PREDATOR THROUGH 
THESE FISH WILL TAKE ON ANYTHING AND THEY'RE REALLY UNPREDICTABLE 
THEY'VE BEEN KNOWN TO SKEWER BIG SEA TURTLES 
AND EVEN MAKO SHARKS THAT ATTACK THEM 
THEY'VE FOUND BILLS BROKEN OFF IN THEIR SPINE 
SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO SWIM WITH ONE OF THESE CRITTERS 
AT NIGHT AND IT'S SPORTING ONE OF THESE BILLS THIS WEAPON 
IT'S GOING TO BE AN EXCITING EVENING 
WE'D BETTER GO THEN EH LET'S GET GOING 
THIS IS NOT A NORMAL FISHING TRIP 
CAPTAIN TIM PALMER CATCHES SWORDFISH FOR A LIVING 
BUT IN A CAREFULLY MANAGED WAY 
HE HAS A UNIQUE ABILITY FOR FINDING THESE DEEP DWELLING ANIMALS 
SO ON THIS TRIP 
HE'S AGREED TO HELP SCIENTISTS FIT TRACKING DEVICES TO THEM 
THIS MAY ALSO GIVE RICK A CHANCE TO FILM ONE 
AT SUNDOWN THEY LET OUT THE LONG BAITED LINES INTO THE GULF STREAM 
WHEN EVERYTHING FEELS RIGHT 
NO ONE HAS ATTEMPTED TO FILM SWORDFISH UNDERWATER BEFORE 
ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN 
I'M CERTAINLY PUMPED UP 
ABOUT GETTING INTO THE WATER WITH THIS BIG SWORDFISH 
WE PRETTY MUCH KNOW ABOUT THE BODY LANGUAGE OF SHARKS 
BUT THERE'S NO MANUAL TO TELL US 
HOW TO APPROACH A BIG SWORDFISH UNDERWATER 
OH THERE HE GOES YEAH 
HE'S A FISH 
WITHIN THE HOUR A SWORDFISH TAKES THE BAIT 
THE RESEARCHERS PREPARE THE SATELLITE TAG 
ONCE ATTACHED IT WILL RECORD DETAILS 
OF THE ANIMAL'S JOURNEYS INTO THE DEEP 
AND THEN POP OFF FOR COLLECTION 
HOW'S IT FEELING DENNIS 
BUT NOT BEFORE A STRUGGLE 
IT TAKES THREE HOURS TO HAUL THE FISH CLOSE TO THE BOAT 
THERE'S A FOUR HUNDRED POUND FISH RIGHT UNDER US RIGHT NOW 
A SECOND FREE SWIMMING SWORDFISH CIRCLES UNDER THE BOAT 
BUT THE CREW MUST FIRST TRY AND CONTAIN THE LONG SWORD 
OF THE FISH THEY'VE CAUGHT 
USING A POLE OR SNOOTER 
THEN THEY ATTACH THE TAG 
MEANWHILE RICK HAS JUMPED IN 
TO TRY AND FILM THE FREE SWIMMING SWORDFISH 
HOPING IT WILL MOVE INTO THE LIGHT 
BUT THAT MEANS SWIMMING DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE ONE THEY'RE TAGGING 
YOU WONDER IF THE GUYS ON THE SURFACE 
WHO ARE TRYING TO TAG THE FISH REALLY HAVE A HOLD OF IT 
CAN THEY HANG ON TO THIS FISH IF IT GAINS STRENGTH AND ENERGY 
THAT'S REALLY A TRICKY SITUATION 
SWORDFISH ARE AGGRESSIVE 
THEY WILL SPEAR EACH OTHER AND HAVE BEEN KNOWN 
TO MAKE UNPROVOKED ATTACKS ON BOATS AND SUBMERSIBLES 
IT'S A FISH THAT'S CHANGED LITTLE OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS 
IT DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO BEHAVIOUR THAT WE UNDERSTAND AT ALL 
IT'S GOT THOSE GREAT BIG EYES THAT WOULD STARE AT YOU IN THE DARK 
YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT SURE WHO'S HOME THERE 
YOU ALL RIGHT 
THE FISH HAS HAD ENOUGH 
FRUSTRATINGLY THE OTHER SWORDFISH REMAINS OUT OF SIGHT 
RUNNING WATER OVER THE TAGGED FISH'S GILLS 
WILL RE OXYGENATE IT SO IT'S IN GOOD SHAPE FOR RELEASE 
IT'S RICK'S LAST CHANCE TO FILM IT SWIMMING FREELY 
BUT WITHIN SECONDS 
IT'S GONE 
THE TAGS HAVE REVEALED THAT SWORDFISH 
REGULARLY SWIM FROM THE SURFACE DOWN TO TWO THOUSAND FEET 
BUT RICK WANTED MORE TIME AT THE SURFACE WITH IT 
FREE SWIMMING SWORDFISH ARE PROVING VERY HARD TO FILM 
HIS DREAM TO SWIM WITH A HEMINGWAY GRANDER A GIANT MARLIN 
IS ALSO LOOKING UNLIKELY 
THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER PLACES LEFT TO LOOK 
ON A REMOTE PENINSULA IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA 
THE ENDEAVOUR RIVER WASHES NUTRIENTS OUT TOWARDS THE GREAT BARRIER REEF 
THEY COMBINE WITH CURRENTS TIDES AND STRONG WINDS TO PRODUCE 
PERFECT CONDITIONS FOR GIANT MARLIN 
COMMERCIAL LONG LINERS WOULD HAVE FISHED THEM OUT LONG AGO 
IF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HADN'T BANNED ALL BUT DOMESTIC OPERATORS 
THIRTY MILES OUT BLACK MARLIN STILL COME TO SPAWN 
BUT IT'S NOT SAFE TO GO OUT THERE UNTIL THE WIND DROPS 
RICK HAS ASKED THE BEST GAME FISH OUTFIT TO HELP HIM FIND THE MARLIN 
BUT EVEN CAPTAIN TIM DEAN CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE WEATHER 
WHAT ABOUT THIS WIND 
IT'S BEEN WITH US NOW FOR THREE WEEKS 
LATE SEASON WIND IT'S UNSEASONAL FOR US 
BUT IF IT TAKES THE FISH THAT'S PART OF THE DEAL HERE YOU KNOW 
IT'S ROUGH WEATHER IT'S HARD 
NOTHING EASY ABOUT CHASING ONE THOUSAND POUND BLACK MARLIN 
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT THE BIGGEST CAMERA I COULD FIND 
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT AND A BIG LENS 
HOW'S YOUR SEASON BEEN TIM THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FISH AROUND 
THE WIND IS RELENTLESS 
BUT CAPTAIN DEAN REMAINS HOPEFUL THAT IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT 
HE'S STILL IN AWE OF THESE FISH 
THE BIG BLACKS THEY EAT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING THAT SWIMS PAST THEM 
RICK THESE FISH WHEN THEY ARE COMING INTO YOUR PATTERN OF BAITS 
OR LURES AND YOU WATCH THESE THINGS ACTIVELY FEED IT'S FRIGHTENING 
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY IF THEY ROARED YOU WOULDN'T CATCH THEM 
YOU'D BE TOO SCARED 
ON THE LAST POSSIBLE FILMING DAY THE WEATHER BREAKS 
THEY HEAD OUT TO THE NORTHERN PART OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF 
THE RIBBON REEFS WHERE THE FEMALE MARLIN COME TO SPAWN 
GET READY THERE 
THE CREW PREP LARGE BONITO AND MACKEREL AS BAIT 
THERE ARE NO HOOKS 
THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO LURE A FEMALE MARLIN CLOSE TO THE BOAT 
RICK NEEDS TO BE AT THE READY 
BECAUSE WHEN THE MOMENT COMES IT'LL COME QUICKLY 
AND IT WON'T LAST LONG 
TIM'S TOLD RICK HE'LL BE LUCKY TO GET THIRTY SECONDS 
IN THE WATER WITH MARLIN 
ONLY AN EXPERIENCED CAPTAIN LIKE TIM 
CAN TELL WHETHER A DARK SHAPE UNDER THE WATER IS A MARLIN OR A SHARK 
THERE HE IS DAVE ON YOU 
WIND IT UP GET READY THERE RICK 
GET READY NICE BIG FISH CLEAR YOURS ANDY CLEAR YOURS 
GET READY WITH THAT CAMERA HOLD 'EM THERE DAVE 
O. K. THERE HE IS WIND IT UP 
WIND IT UP OH IT'S A NICE FISH 
THERE'S THREE FISH THERE 
GO RICK GO GO 
YOU'RE IN YOU'RE IN CAMERA 
WIND IT UP THERE WIND IT UP 
OH NICE WORK HE'S RIGHT THERE AMONGST THEM 
THE BIG FISH IS ON ME SO FAST 
I JUST HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO SWITCH ON THE CAMERA 
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS DON'T BLOW IT GET THE SHOT 
THE MARLIN IS ENORMOUS 
A BILLFISH THIS LARGE TWELVE FEET LONG 
WEIGHING AS MUCH AS FIVE GROWN MEN 
HAS NEVER BEEN FILMED SWIMMING FREELY BEFORE 
BUT WHAT DOES SUCH A BIG FISH MAKE OF A MAN 
I'M WONDERING WHAT SHE'S SEEING 
IS SHE LOOKING IN THE DOME OF MY UNDERWATER HOUSING 
DOES SHE SEE HER OWN REFLECTION OR DOES IT LOOK LIKE ONE BIG EYE 
I HAVE THIS FEELING THAT SHE'S LOOKING ME OVER 
AND THAT I'M SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN HER WORLD 
BUT SHE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE FRIGHTENED 
I'M FIGHTING A STRONG CURRENT PUSHING THIS HEAVY CAMERA 
AND THE FISH MOVES SO QUICKLY WITH JUST A FLICK OF HER TAIL 
SHE'S OUT OF SIGHT 
FORTUNATELY SHE KEEPS COMING BACK FOR THE BAIT AND TO LOOK RICK OVER 
JUST WHEN I'M FINALLY KEEPING UP WITH HER 
I REALISE I'VE COME UPON A MATING SCENE 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF LITTLE MALES 
MAYBE A QUARTER OF HER SIZE IN THERE TOO 
FLUSHING BRIGHT BLUE WITH EXCITEMENT THEY LOOK 
FOR THEIR CHANCE TO FERTILIZE SOME OF HER MILLIONS OF EGGS 
SHE'S NOT JUST A BIG FISH 
SHE WILL PRODUCE THE NEXT GENERATION 
RICK GETS NOT THIRTY SECONDS BUT AN EXTRAORDINARY TWENTY MINUTES 
ALONGSIDE THE FISH THAT CAPTURED HIS IMAGINATION SO LONG AGO 
TWENTY MINUTES IS AS LONG AS RICK DARES 
THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS FILMING THAT BIG MARLIN 
THERE WERE THREE BULL SHARKS CIRCLING BELOW 
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO IN THE WATER OFF AUSTRALIA 
ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF AND FILM MARLIN 
YOU BETTER BE PREPARED FOR SHARKS 
THEY'VE BEEN KNOWN TO DEVOUR 
AN EXHAUSTED MARLIN IN SEVENTEEN SECONDS 
TIM WHAT A BIG FISH UNBELIEVABLE RICK 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT A GRANDER LOOKS LIKE UNDERWATER 
BUT THAT FISH WAS THIS BIG AROUND 
SHE WAS A FISH WELL OVER NINE HUNDRED POUNDS 
ALL LIT UP YOU WERE RIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF THEM ALL 
IT WAS GREAT TO WATCH SPECTACULAR 
IN ALL MY YEARS I'VE NEVER SEEN A BIG FISH 
JUST FOLLOW US ALONG LIKE THAT FOR SUCH A LONG TIME 
SHE CAME BACK SHE KEPT COMING BACK LEAVING COMING IN EATING THE BAIT 
THREE BULL SHARKS JUST UNDERNEATH LOOKING AT THE SCENE 
NICE WORK MATE 
WELL DONE MATE THANKS AGAIN 
RICK HAS FULFILLED HIS BOYHOOD AMBITION 
BUT THERE'S ONE OUTSTANDING MYSTERY 
HE'S ONLY EVER FILMED ADULT BILLFISH 
EVEN COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN MOSTLY CATCH MATURE ANIMALS 
SO WHERE DO YOUNG BILLFISH SPEND THE EARLY PART OF THEIR LIVES 
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHILE OFF COSTA RICA'S PACIFIC COAST 
ON ANOTHER ASSIGNMENT 
RICK SPOTTED SOMETHING IN THESE STRONG CURRENTS AND SHELTERING REEFS 
THAT FEW PEOPLE HAD SEEN BEFORE A SINGLE BABY SAILFISH 
HE DECIDES TO RETURN 
KNOWING THAT HE MAY BE LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK 
ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE HE'LL BE HUNTING IN THE DARK 
RICK AND THE CAPTAIN TAKE THE BOAT TO THE EDGE OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF 
WHERE A DEEP CANYON TRAVERSES THE OCEAN FLOOR 
THEY DRIFT OVER IT PUSHED BY WIND AND CURRENT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK DEPTH 
DEPTH IS LOOKING GOOD FOR WHAT WE WANT TO DO TONIGHT YEAH I THINK SO 
THAT BAIT'S SLOWLY RISING UP 
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL COME UP AND GIVE US A SHOW 
LOOK AT THAT WATER TEMPERATURE EIGHTY SEVEN DEGREES 
YEAH YOU THINK YOU NEED THAT LITTLE THICKER WET SUIT 
I DON'T THINK I NEED ANY BUT I DON'T LIKE TO BE STUNG 
IT'S A PERFECT NIGHT FOR DRIFTING THE CURRENT NOT TOO STRONG 
THEIR LIGHT WILL ATTRACT COUNTLESS TINY ANIMALS 
WE HAVE SQUID NOW 
SQUID ARE IN THE LIGHTS RIGHT NOW 
SO JUST LET THAT LIGHT WORK AND SEE WHO COMES UP 
SOMEBODY'S DONE THERE 
ANIMALS CAN MATERIALIZE FROM ANYWHERE 
WE'RE DOWN SWIMMING AROUND IN THAT DARK SEA 
AND SUDDENLY I FEEL A WHOOSH UNDERNEATH MY ARMPIT 
AND I THINK IT'S MY DIVE PARTNER 
AND I LOOK TOWARDS HIM AND HE POINTS TOWARDS THE SURFACE 
AND THERE'S AN ADULT SAILFISH 
SWIMMING RIGHT OVER OUR HEAD FEEDING 
THAT WAS THE LAST THING I WAS EXPECTING 
UNLIKE SWORDFISH AND MARLIN SAILFISH DON'T SEE WELL IN THE DARK 
UNTIL THIS IMAGE 
ADULT SAILFISH HAD NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED NOCTURNAL FEEDERS 
THEY'RE FAR MORE VERSATILE THAN WE EVER THOUGHT 
THIS FISH IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE UNDERWATER LIGHT 
IT'S A KIND OF BEHAVIOUR WE CAN ONLY LEARN BY GETTING INTO THE WATER 
AND SPENDING A GREAT DEAL OF TIME IN THEIR WORLD 
AND THEN A MIRACLE IN MINIATURE APPEARS 
JUST A FEW MONTHS OLD PERHAPS 
BUT A RAZOR TOOTHED BILLFISH IS ALREADY A FORMIDABLE HUNTER 
EVEN MORE REMARKABLE IT'S NOT ALONE 
THERE ARE DOZENS OF BABY SAILFISH SWORDFISH AND MARLIN 
IMPROBABLY RICK HAS FOUND A BILLFISH NURSERY 
THE OFFSHORE WATERS HERE 
MUST OFFER THE BEST HIDING PLACES TO THESE HATCHLINGS 
THEY AFTER ALL ARE THE SURVIVORS FROM THE MILLIONS OF EGGS 
WHICH THEIR MOTHERS BROADCAST ONTO THE OCEAN CURRENTS 
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE RICK WANTED TO SWIM WITH A GRANDER 
BUT IN FINDING THESE BABIES 
HE'S WITNESSED A FRAGILE PROMISE TO THE FUTURE 
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT BILLFISH 
I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT BILLFISH 
BUT I THINK JUST HAVING AN ANIMAL THAT CAN SWIM AT THAT SPEED 
THAT HAS THAT MUCH POWER AND HOW VERSATILE IT IS 
TO GO FROM THE SURFACE FEEDING DOWN INTO THE DEEP 
AND HOW SUCCESSFUL IT'S BEEN FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS 
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S WORTH SAVING 
THE GREAT FISH THAT SANTIAGO CAUGHT 
IN HEMINGWAY'S OLD MAN AND THE SEA 
THE GIANT MARLIN IS STILL WITH US 
BUT IT WILL ONLY SURVIVE IF WE STOP KILLING AND EATING SO MANY OF THEM 
I'VE RE READ THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA MANY TIMES 
WHAT TOUCHES ME MOST IS HOW SANTIAGO THE FISHERMEN 
KNEW THAT HE'D GONE OUT TOO FAR 
HE HAD EXCEEDED HIS LIMITS TO BRING THAT BIG FISH IN IN ONE PIECE 
AT THAT POINT HE REGRETTED EVEN KILLING IT 
NOW NOTHING SEEMS TO HUMBLE US 
WE REALLY HAVE THE POWER 
TO STRIP AWAY ALL THE BIG FISH FROM THE OCEANS 
BUT IN DOING THIS WE JUST DIMINISH OURSELVES
