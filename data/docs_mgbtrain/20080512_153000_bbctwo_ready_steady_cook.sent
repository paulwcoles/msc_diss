PINE BECAUSE I LOVE PINE NUTS 
BIT OF SPINACH JUST A NOD TO THE HEALTHY 
WITH CARROTS AND A NICE BIT OF BRANDY BRANDY DARK CHOCOLATE

I THINK A RICE PILAF AND SPINACH SOUP OR SOMETHING AND CHOCOLATE 
I'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT 
BUT IT'S MY FAVOURITE INGREDIENT SO I'M GLAD 
WE LIKE CHOCOLATE RICE PUDDING EH 
ARE YOU A RICE PUDDING FAN YEAH I DON'T MIND 
AND YOU LIKE BROWN SKIN AND ALL THAT ON THE TOP OR JUST A STRAIGHT CREAMY ONE 
YOU MAKE EVERYTHING SOUND SO NAUGHTY STRAIGHT AND CREAMY I THINK 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LET'S HEAR IT FOR SHAUN AND SOPHIE 
O. K. LET'S GET OUR CHEFS STARTED YOU KNOW THE RULES 
THEY GET TWENTY MINUTES TO COME UP WITH FABULOUS IDEAS IS IT POSSIBLE 
IT NORMALLY IS LET'S GET THEM GOING BY SIMPLY SAYING READY STEADY 
COOK 
O. K. THAT'S IT 
DO YOU DON AN APRON AT HOME STIRLING 
NO I'M DREADFUL I'M MESSY AS WELL 
OUR CLOTHES GET GREASY WE DON'T REALISE DO WE NO WE DON'T 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WHAT ABOUT OUR AUDIENCE I'M GOING TO ASK YOU GUYS OUT THERE 
PUT YOUR HANDS UP IF YOU WEAR APRONS WHEN YOU COOK AT HOME THERE WE ARE 
GOSH THAT'S A LOT ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF YOU 
WE'RE REALLY LUCKY TODAY ON READY STEADY COOK BECAUSE STIRLING 
YOUR CHOPPPING BOARD IS HERE STIRLING GET YOURSELF A KNIFE 
STIRLING'S BROUGHT ALONG THIS BEAUTIFUL FRESH TRUFFLE FOR GINO AND GINO GOT PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT 
AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW HE'LL INCORPORATE IT 
I'M A SIMPLE MAN I GET EXCITED ABOUT ANYTHING REALLY YES 
NOW ALL WE DO THE FIRST RULE WHEN WE COOK PASTA BIG POT THREE QUARTER OF WATER 
AND A GOOD HANDFUL OF SALT GUYS 
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE IS SALT INTO THE WATER NUMBER ONE BECAUSE IT COOKS 
IT BOILS IT FASTER AND NUMBER TWO BECAUSE THEN YOU FLAVOUR THE PASTA 
VERY IMPORTANT TO DO THAT 
AND THE WORST MISTAKE YOU CAN DO IS PUT SOME OIL IN THERE COMPLETELY WASTE OF MONEY 
BECAUSE AS SOON YOU PUT THE OIL THE OIL GOES ON THE SURFACE AND IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY O. K. 
A JOB FOR STIRLING DOWN HERE NOW A JOB FOR YOU 
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IF YOU CAN GET ME THIS PARSLEY HERE 
CHOP IT VERY FINELY FOR ME INTO ONE OF THE SMALL BOWLS 
NOW AINSLEY THIS IS A GREAT BAG OF COURSE 
USUALLY BUY THEM LIKE THAT OTHERWISE YOU GO IN THE DELI THEY DO IT 
DO YOU PREFER IT TO BE CARVED IN FRONT OF YOU OR YOU DON'T MIND 
I DO BECAUSE THE SMELL AND THE FLAVOUR IS TEN TIMES BETTER THAN THIS 
ALTHOUGH THIS ONE ARE O. K. BUT IN THE DELI THEY DO IT MUCH BETTER 
NOW LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING IF YOU BUY CHICKEN LIKE THIS IN THE SUPERMARKETS 
WITH THE SKIN ON IT WILL COST YOU TWENTY P. LESS IF YOU ACTUALLY DO THAT 
O. K. 
IT'S TRUE ISN'T IT IT'S PERFECTLY TRUE 
I SWEAR TO YOU IF IT'S WITH THE SKIN ON IT WILL COST YOU LESS THAN IF IT'S WITH THE SKIN OUT O. K. 
SO BUY THEM WITH THE SKIN ON AND JUST TAKE THEM AWAY NICE AND EASY 
HERE I'M GOING TO DO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS 
ONE I'M GOING TO A BEAUTIFUL POLLO ALLA PIZZAIOLA O. K. WHICH IS CHEF 
POLLO ALLA PIZZAIOLA IS I'M GOING TO MAKE A TOMATO SAUCE THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD DO WITH A PIZZA 
GARLIC OLIVE OIL A TOUCH OF OREGANO AND TOMATOES BEAUTIFUL 
THEN I'M GOING TO COOK IT IN THERE BUFFALO MOZZARELLA ON TOP 
INTO THE OVEN JUST LIKE WE WOULD DO WITH A PIZZA 
BEAUTIFUL AND THE PARMA HAM 
THE PARMA HAM WILL FEATURE IN A BURGER 
BECAUSE I'M ALSO GOING TO MAKE A NICE BEAUTIFUL CHICKEN BURGER WITH PEAS ON A NICE CIABATTA 
IT'S GOING TO BE FANTASTIC AND ALSO I'LL MAKE A PLATE OF PASTA 
I'M GONNA MAKE THREE PLATES OF PASTA ONE OF THE PLATES OF PASTA 
I'M GOING TO ROLL IT INTO THE PARMA HAM YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT SOUNDS GOOD STIRLING ARE YOU HAPPY 
VERY HAPPY WITH THAT 
I'VE LEARNT SOMETHING ALREADY ARE YOU QUITE GOOD IN THE KITCHEN 
COS THE WAY YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR KNIFE AND DOING STUFF 
JUST GIVES ME THE IMPRESSION YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE 
I LIKE THE KITCHEN I HAVE TO SAY 
MY DAD WAS IN HOTEL AND CATERING AND TRAINED AS A CHEF 
AND HE TAUGHT US HOW TO USE KNIVES AND 
ISN'T THAT BRILLIANT I STILL CUT MYSELF 
WE DO TOO BUT I'M DOING THIS WITH MY KIDS AT THE MOMENT 
USE THE RIGHT KNIFE FOR THE RIGHT JOB AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
AND YOU WON'T DO THAT WITH A SMALL KNIFE BUT LOOK BEAUTIFUL 
SO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN TODAY ONE OR TWO THINGS YOU WANT TO DO 
YES LIKE YOU SHOULDN'T PUT YOUR OIL IN THE PAN 
WHEN DO YOU PUT YOUR OIL IN GINO 
WHEN YEAH FOR THE PASTA YEAH NEVER 
NEVER NONE WHY YOU DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME 
I LISTENED WHAT DID I SAY 
NEVER PUT THE OIL IN THE PAN IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY OR YOU ARE A RICH WOMAN I'M LOADED 
I THOUGHT YOU'D SAY TO PUT IT IN AT A CERTAIN POINT THOUGH SO YOU DON'T PUT ANY OIL 
ANY OIL INTO THE PAN IT DOESN'T NEED IT LET ME SHOW YOU 
IF I PUT OIL 
LIKE AN COUPLE AREN'T THEY THEY'RE HAVING A MOAN AT ONE ANOTHER FANTASTIC 
I WONDER WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN SHE'S AT HOME WITH SHAUN 
WE'LL FIND OUT IN A MINUTE BUT SOPHIE'S HERE HELLO AINSLEY 
SHE'S OUR NEW CHEF LET'S FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S DOING 
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE THEN 
O. K. I'VE GOT SOME ONIONS SWEATING OFF HERE FOR MY SPINACH SOUP 
AND A PAN NEARLY ON FIRE TOO AS ALWAYS 
THAT'S GOOD NOTHING WRONG IN THAT I'VE A BIT OF RICE 
I'M DOING SPICED RICE PILAF WITH A BIT OF LAMB THROUGH IT 
SO I'VE GOT CINNAMON TURMERIC SMELL IT 
IT SMELLS GREAT DOESN'T IT LOOK AT THAT YEAH 
AND THE TURMERIC WILL GIVE IT THAT REALLY GREAT YELLOW COLOUR 
UMMM IT'S REALLY AROMATIC DO YOU LIKE THAT SHAUN YEAH I LIKE A BIT OF AROMATIC 
O. K. FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GO BY THE WAY GET THAT RICE ON AND EVERYTHING 
SHAUN'S BEEN WASHING BABY CARROTS WHICH WE'LL DO IN A HONEY GLAZE 
THAT'S VERY DEMANDING AND HE'S BREAKING UP SOME CHOCOLATE FOR MY CHOCOLATE PANCAKES 
O. K. NOW WHAT ELSE CAN SHAUN DO FOR YOU THEN 
IF YOU COULD BASICALLY OPEN THOSE GRAB ME SOME BASIL I CAN DO THAT 
SHALL I GIVE HIM THIS BOARD SO HE'S GOT HIS OWN LITTLE BOARD YES 
AND WE CAN TURN THAT OVER ANY TIME YOU WANT THERE YOU GO MATE 
AND YOU WANT A BIT OF BASIL PLEASE THAT ONE THERE 
O. K. WHICH ONE THERE YOU DO KNOW WHAT BASIL IS I HOPE WHICH ONE 
THAT BASILY LOOKING ONE THAT ONE THERE 
I'D GO FOR THE FRESH LOOKING FROM THE TOP MYSELF YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HELP HIM 
YOU GOT TO HELP HIM AIN'T YA I CAN'T OPEN THIS ACTUALLY 
AND I WANT A BIT OF GARLIC IN THERE AS WELL 
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL LAMB FILLET AND A GREAT CUT 
COS IT'S VERY TENDER WITH NOT MUCH FAT SO FROM A HEALTH POINT OF VIEW IT'S GOOD TOO 
I'M GOING TO SEAR HALF OF IT AND JUST ROAST IT WHOLE IN THE OVEN 
AND CUT OTHER HALF CUT INTO LITTLE PIECES AND COOKED IN MY RICE PILAF 
BEAUTIFUL SHALL I GET THE RICE IN THERE FOR YOU YOU CAN AINSLEY 
O. K. SO YOU'RE DOING TWO DIFFERENT WAYS TO LAMB ARE YOU 
YEAH LAMB'S QUITE VERSATILE IT GOES WELL WITH SPICES 
IT GOES VERY WELL WITH GARLIC AND BASIL AND STUFF 
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITE MEATS 
BEAUTIFUL O. K. AND SO IF YOU WENT OUT TO A RESTAURANT 
ARE YOU A PERSON THAT WOULD GO FOR LAMB 
OR WOULD YOU GO FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE 
I LIKE BEEF BIG PROPER STEAKS O. K. 
NOW WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS BLITZ IN HERE 
HAVE YOU MADE PESTO BEFORE NO 
COME AND JOIN US DOWN HERE WE DON'T MIND THAT O. K. BASICALLY IT'S 
PESTO THE ONLY THING THIS IS GOING TO MISS IS PARMESAN 
SO PESTO NORMALLY IS PINE NUTS GARLIC BASIL AND PARMESAN AND OLIVE OIL 
BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITHOUT PARMESAN SOME NICE PINE NUTS AND BASIL THAT YOU'VE PICKED 
AND GARLIC SO IF YOU GRAB A CLOVE OF GARLIC AS WELL THERE YOU GO 
AND I'VE JUST SEARED THAT BECAUSE I LIKE TO GET A BIT OF COLOUR ON IT

SO HOW DID YOU START COOKING IS IT MUM DAD OR SCHOOL OR WHAT 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTO FOOD SINCE I WAS TINY 
I LIKED TO MAKE CAKES WHEN I WAS FOUR AND BECAME A PROFESSIONAL CHEF WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN WOW 
SO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AT IT 
AH SO YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT ABOUT THIRTY FIVE YEARS THEN YES YES YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD 
IT'S THE HEALTHY EATING THAT DOES IT 
OH LOVELY SO I'M GOING TO SEAR THAT OFF BECAUSE IT'S MEAT TO GET A GOOD COLOUR 
O. K. TWELVE MINUTES TO GO GUYS AND WHAT ABOUT YOU SHAUN 
ACTING DID IT COME NATURALLY AT SCHOOL OR SOMETHING 
NO NO I WAS QUITE A LATE VOCATION I WAS DOING FINE ARTS AT COLLEGE 
AND GOT INTO CINEMA AND THE ACTORS' STUDIO AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING ELIA KAZAN 
AND WANTED TO MOVE TOWARDS WHAT THEY WERE DOING WHAT THE PROCESS WAS AND GOT INTO ACTING THAT WAY SURE 
COS I WAS STUDYING ART THEN SWAPPED OVER 
FILM IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE BEEN IN OF COURSE WE ASSOCIATE YOU WITH DOCTORS 
BUT YOU WERE IN COLD MOUNTAIN WITH JUDE LAW WAS IT QUITE NICE LITTLE BITS 
IT DON'T MATTER YOU DID IT MATE 
YEAH YEAH IT WAS GOOD FUN ACTUALLY 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO MORE OF THAT TYPE OF THING OF COURSE 
IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING TO WORK IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS 
AND WALKING ONTO THE SET OF COLUMBIA PICTURES IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING 
POWERFUL YEAH INCREDIBLE AND IT'S THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE COMPARED TO PERHAPS WHERE YOU FILM DOCTORS 
GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT IT'S LIKE THE DIFFERENCE 
MY MAIN MEMORY OF SAY COLD MOUNTAIN IS OF ANTHONY MINGHELLA 
WHO COMES OVER TO YOU TO SAY HELLO 
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT HIS FIRST AD WHO WILL TALK TO THE D. O. P. OR THE GAFFER THEN THE GAFFER RELAYS SOMETHING 
AND THEY'RE ALL ITALIAN THESE GUYS THE SPARKS AND LIGHTING 
AND IT WOULD BE RELAYED TO THEM AND THEY RAN EVERYWHERE IT'S PHENOMENAL TO WATCH 
O. K. AND ON DOCTORS MUCH CALMER MUCH MORE MELLOW 
IT'S A LITTLE HOME UNIT A BIT LIKE A LITTLE COTTAGE INDUSTRY 
EVERYONE'S USED TO EACH OTHER IT'S FRIENDLY AND YOU GET IT DONE 
YEAH USED TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE YOU AND STIRLING THERE HAVE THIS WONDERFUL ON SCREEN ROMANCE 
AND I BELIEVE IN THE SOAP AWARDS RECENTLY YOU WERE VOTED THE BEST ON SCREEN LOVEY COUPLE 
YES I THINK IT WAS THE BEST ON SCREEN PARTNERSHIP OR SOMETHING 
WHICH CAN GO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LOVE INTEREST 
BUT IT WAS NICE TO GET THAT SOMETHING WAS BUBBLING 
YES WE'VE ALWAYS GOT ON WELL ACTUALLY IT'S GOOD O. K. 
HE'S NOT GIVING MUCH AWAY STIRLING HERE HE DOESN'T LIKE ME NO 
NO HE DOESN'T LIKE ME I'M A VERY GOOD ACTOR REALLY WHO INVITED OUT WHO TO START WITH 
NO SHE'S A GOOD LAUGH 
IT WASN'T REALLY AN INVITE OUT THING WE JUST GOT ON REALLY WELL 
AND OUR SITUATIONS JUST CHANGED AND THERE WE WERE 
FANTASTIC O. K. WE'LL TALK AGAIN BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER ALSO 
SHAUN WAS IN EASTENDERS AS CONOR BEFORE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
AND I WANT TO HAVE A CHAT WITH HIM ABOUT THAT AND HOW IT COMPARES TO DOCTORS 
LET'S FIND OUT HOW SOPHIE'S GETTING ON 
WE'VE PINE NUTS TOASTING OFF WE'VE GOT WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD 
ABSOLUTELY WE'VE GOT CARROTS ON THERE PILAF ON THERE SOUP ON THERE PINE NUTS TOASTING THERE 
AND WHAT WILL WE BE MAKING HERE PANCAKES O. K. 
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BEAT MAKING PANCAKES BASICALLY 
I'VE GOT SOME FLOUR IN THERE SOME ICING SUGAR 
SELF RAISING FLOUR OR PLAIN FLOUR SELF RAISING FLOUR 
I DON'T THINK IT MAKES THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE 
BUT I THINK IT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER 
SHAUN JUST POP THAT IN THERE IS THIS ENOUGH BASIL THAT'S BEAUTIFUL 
HOW DO WE FLAVOUR THOSE WHAT'S GOES IN THERE 
THEY'LL BE PLAIN PANCAKES BUT WITH A BIT OF MELTED CHOCOLATE OVER THE TOP 
AND SOME BRANDY WHIPPED CREAM SOUND GOOD 
I THINK SO LET'S GET BACK AND SEE HOW GINO'S GETTING ON 
THANKS VERY MUCH GUYS 
IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING FINDING OUT ABOUT HOW NEW CHEFS BRING THINGS TOGETHER AND THE WAY THEY DO IT 
WE'VE GOT OUR ESTABLISHED GUYS LIKE GINO 
AND I'M SURE HE'LL EXCITE US WITH ALL THESE LOVELY FLAVOURS O. K. AINSLEY 
SMELL THIS BEAUTIFUL 
GARLIC OREGANO A BIT OF CHILI A TOUCH OF RAW EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL AT THE END 
O. K. AND WHAT ABOUT THE TRUFFLE WHERE'S THE TRUFFLE 
THE TRUFFLE IS ALL GOING IN AT THE END ALL AT THE END 
WE GOT FRESH BASIL IN THERE NOW WE BUILD UP LIKE A PIZZA 
SO YOU GET YOUR SLICED MOZZARELLA YOU PUT ON TOP OF THE CHICKEN LIKE THAT O. K.

SOME OF MY FRIENDS ARE A BIT COMPLICATED 
YEAH LIKE WHAT TYPE OF DIETS THE ODD VEGETARIAN OR 
NO IT'S NOT JUST THE ODD VEGETARIAN WE HAVE LACTOSE INTOLERANT 
OH WOW 
WHICH MEANS NO TOMATOES NO LEMON NO WINE NO NOTHING THAT YOU'D PUT IN ANY KIND OF SAUCE

PICK UP YOUR CUTLERY AND HAVE A GO START 
NOT ME YOU TASTE YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY YOUR OWN FOOD 
I CAN OF COURSE WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER 
LET'S START WITH THIS ONE POLLO ALLA PIZZAIOLA 
GREAT DISH VERY SIMPLE TO DO IT TRY IT 
OLIVE OIL GARLIC TOMATO PUREE COOK THE CHICKEN WITH A LITTLE OREGANO AND CHILI 
THEN I SHOWED EVERYBODY PUT THE MOZZARELLA ON TOP 
FOUR MINUTES INTO THE OVEN THE MOZZARELLA IS MELTED WITH THE OREGANO AND THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE 
YOU GET ALL THE MOZZARELLA 
LOOK AT THAT ALL THE STRETCHY MOZZARELLA ON TOP FANTASTIC 
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU ADD I CAN TASTE ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT'S IN IT 
YES A GREAT DISH IS A GREAT BALANCE OF FLAVOURS 
THEN WE DID A VERY QUICK CHICKEN BURGER TAKE A BIT OF THAT 
WITH THE PARSLEY IN THERE AND THE MINT YOGURT VERY FRESH O. K. 
I LIKE TO DO STUFF LIKE THAT 
I THINK CHICKEN BURGER THE HOME MADE ONE IS A GREAT WAY IF YOU HAVE KIDS 
BECAUSE YOU CAN PUT WHATEVER YOU WANT INSIDE 
FRESH PEAS OR CARROTS IN THERE THEY WILL LOVE IT 
O. K. STRAIGHT INTO YOUR PENNE 
THEN WE GOT THE PASTA WE GOT THIS ONE WE CALL IT PASTA WITH NO SAUCE 
BECAUSE IT'S GARLIC CHILI A BIT OF PARSLEY WITH EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL 
VERY POPULAR IN THE SOUTH OF ITALY THIS ONE 
STIRLING MADE A BEAUTIFUL NEST OF PARMA HAM 
A GREAT DISH BECAUSE IT LOOKS GREAT IF YOU HAVE GUESTS 
IN THERE I'VE GOT PEAS CREAM CHERRY TOMATO FRESH TRUFFLE ON TOP M. M. M. 
THAT'S GOOD I LIKE THAT VERY NICE 
AND LOOK HOW MANY DISHES I DID WITH TRUFFLE 
I ONLY USED PROBABLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE TRUFFLE THAT I HAD 
SO IT GOES A LONG WAY 
AS I SAID BEFORE DRY RICE COVER WITH DRY RICE IN A CUP 
PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE AND YOU CAN DO A HELL OF A LOT 
ANOTHER GOOD ONE IF YOU DO A FRIED EGG IN THE MORNING A LITTLE BIT OF TRUFFLE ON TOP IS UNBEATABLE 
BUT I HEARD THAT TRUFFLE WAS AN APHRODISIAC 
THAT'S WHY I USE IT ALL RIGHT THEN 
LET'S HEAR IT FOR GINO AND STIRLING 
YOU'D BETTER GET SOME TRUFFLES FOR BREAKFAST SHAUN 
GO ON PICK UP YOUR CUTLERY MATE YEAH THANK YOU 
LOOK AT THIS ONCE AGAIN STUNNING FOOD

TRY THE SOUP TO START WITH DO YOU THINK TRY IT SEE WHAT YOU THINK 
GO ON THEN A LITTLE BIT OF SOUP THERE 
NOW ALTHOUGH MR. ITALIAN LOVER BOY HAD THAT VERY LUXURY INGREDIENT 
I HAD A GREAT BASKET ANYWAY SO WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THAT IS FANTASTIC THAT'S REALLY GOOD 
I KNOW SHAUN LIKES CLEAN FLAVOURS 
NOT TOO MUCH OVER COMPLICATION 
SO I WANTED TO KEEP IT QUITE KIND OF SIMPLE CLEAN FRESH FOOD THAT'S NICE 
AND TRY A BIT OF THE LAMB THE LAMB WE DID WITH A PESTO DRESSING AND SOME HONEYED CARROTS 
MM O. K. HE LIKES HIS FOOD 
IT'S GOOD IT'S GOOD HEALTHY FOOD AS WELL I THINK WHICH I DO LOVE 
AND THE HONEY CARROTS TOO I LIKE THE IDEA YOU WASH THEM VERY SIMPLY 
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO SCRUB THOSE LITTLE BABY CARROTS TOO MUCH 
NO THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL ON THEIR OWN GETTING THE INGREDIENTS TO SHINE IS IMPORTANT 
M. M. M. THAT'S REALLY GOOD YEAH GOOD BIT OF MEAT 
THAT'S THE THING IT'S NOT OVERLY SEASONED YOU CAN TASTE ALL THE LAMB

SO I'VE GOT THE SAUSAGE IN THERE 
AND THE SMOKED FLAVOUR IS GOING TO GO THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SOUP THAT'S THE IDEA 
A BIT OF SHREDDED CABBAGE 
BEAUTIFUL 
AND WHAT ABOUT GERMAN CUISINE 
IS IT SOMETHING YOU'VE LENT YOUR HAND TO AT SOME STAGE 
I HAVE TO SAY IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I KNOW VERY WELL 
I MEAN IT'S QUITE RICH FOOD 
I TEND TO EAT A VERY LIGHT MORE HEALTH INSPIRED THAT'S RIGHT 
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD A HEALTHY APPROACH TO FOOD YEAH HAS THAT COME FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD 
I THINK TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I LIKE TO LOOK AND FEEL GOOD 
SO THE HEALTHY EATING HELPS WITH THAT HOPEFULLY I HOPE ABSOLUTELY I TRY 
LOOK AT THAT THE SAUSAGES ARE AMAZING THAT LOOKS GOOD WE'RE LOOKING GOOD

THE SLICES ARE DEFINITELY THERE PASTA THIS ALL GOES INTO THE OVEN 
AND A LITTLE BIT OF PEPPER IS SHE TAKING THE MICK 
HAVE YOU GOT ANY TRUFFLE LEFT NO NO MORE TRUFFLE LEFT NO THAT'S A SHAME

WE HAVEN'T GOT BASIL WE HAVEN'T GOT 
WE'VE GOT CHEESE 
CHEESE TO GO WITH THE SOUP 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE A QUICKIE QUESTION FROM ONE OF OUR AUDIENCE MEMBERS 
PLEASE WELCOME TO READY STEADY COOK HELEN WOLSAK 
HELEN HOW ARE YOU LOVELY TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAMME ALL THE WAY FROM BRENTWOOD 
O. K. THE CHEFS OVER THERE ARE QUITE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THINGS 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK 
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE BEST WAY TO COOK THE FISH POLLOCK 
POLLOCK O. K. LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE HEALTHY ROUTE FIRST WITH SOPHIE 
WELL YOU CAN TREAT IT MUCH LIKE YOU WOULD COD OBVIOUSLY CLASSICALLY ENGLISH WE DEEP FRY IT 
BUT FROM A HEALTH POINT OF VIEW WHITE FISH IS FANTASTIC AS IT'S VERY LOW IN FAT AND CALORIES 
SO BAKE IT WITH TOMATOES OLIVES DO IT KIND OF MEDITERRANEAN STYLE 
AN ITALIAN FLAVOUR ALWAYS WORKS VERY WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK GINO 
I HAVE JUST STOLEN HIS ITALIAN LINE OBVIOUSLY 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE COD THE POLLOK 
I KNOW IT'S NOT POPULAR IN ITALY BUT HOW WOULD YOU COOK A BEAUTIFUL THICK WHITE SUCCULENT FISH 
WELL WHAT I WOULD DO STEAM THE FISH FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES FIRST 
COS IT'S GONNA BE A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF MEAT 
THEN THE WAY WE WOULD DO IT IN ITALY A LITTLE BIT OF BLACK OLIVE TAPENADE 
SPREAD IT ALL OVER WRAP IT IN PARMA HAM AND THEN ROAST INTO THE OVEN 
THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IS OVERCOOK IT SO MAKE SURE IT GOES INTO THE OVEN 
FOR ABOUT TWELVE TO THIRTEEN MINUTES TAKE IT OUT AND LET IT REST 
BECAUSE THE RESTING WILL FINISH OFF THE COOKING AND YOU WANT THE MOISTURE NICE AND BEAUTIFUL INSIDE 
BUT ROAST IT WITH PARMA HAM AND BLACK OLIVE TAPENADE FANTASTICO 
HEY THAT'S A GOOD WAY OF DOING IT HAPPY WITH THAT YES 
A COUPLE OF NICE IDEAS THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION 
GIVE HER A ROUND OF APPLAUSE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN VERY NICE 
O. K. SO HOW IS IT GOING HERE 
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO GO CAN I PUT MUSTARD ON MY BRUSCHETTA YES YOU CAN

SO YOU'VE DONE THE GERMAN STYLE CHEESE ON TOAST 
GINO IS DOING A KIND OF ITALIAN INSPIRED BRUSCHETTA YEAH

WHAT'S HAPPENING IS 
O. K. WE HAVE A LITTLE 
DO YOU WANT MAYBE A LITTLE DRESSING TO DRIZZLE OVER THE TOP 
YES THAT WOULD BE LOVELY AINSLEY 
OF COURSE A TRADITIONAL BRUSCHETTA IS MADE WITH TOMATOES BASIL 
EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL A BIT OF SALT AND A LITTLE BIT OF PEPPER 
WHAT I'LL DO HERE HAVE WE GOT SOME WORCHESTER SAUCE 
YES BACK THERE O. K. GINO 
O. K. YOU'VE GOT A MINUTE AND A HALF TO GO NOW 
GINO COULD YOU PLATE UP THE TOAD IN THE HOLE FOR ME

D'YOU WANT TO TRY SOME SOUP FIRST YES COS THAT'S RATHER HOT 
AND THEN WE HAVE THE GERMAN STYLE CHEESE ON TOAST AND THE ITALIAN BRUSCHETTA 
NO THAT IS THE GERMAN STYLE BRUSCHETTA GERMAN STYLE SORRY 
IT COULDN'T BE ITALIAN COULD IT GINO THEN THE SOUP I USED GREEK YOGURT INSTEAD OF SOUR CREAM 
AS IN MODERN GERMAN COOKERY BUT I USED GREEK YOGURT TO GIVE IT A BIT OF A BALANCE OF FLAVOUR 
THERE'S YOUR LOVELY LITTLE BIT OF SAUSAGE THERE AND IT LOOKS GREAT
