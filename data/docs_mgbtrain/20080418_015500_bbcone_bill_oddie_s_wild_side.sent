COMING UP PORNOGRAPHIC PARROTS 
A WUSSY WILDLIFE CAMERAMAN 
THE MIDGES ARE OUT IN SWARMS 
AND CHRIS GETS IN TOUCH WITH HIS INNER FISH 
FIRST OFF TO SCOTLAND TO SET WILDLIFE CAMERAMAN JOHN AITCHISON HIS CHALLENGE 
OH I THINK I'M INSPIRED TO A LITTLE POETRY JOHN 
A LITTLE WEATHER POETRY 
WHICH GOES SOMETHING LIKE VISIT SCOTLAND IN EARLY MAY 
AND EXPERIENCE ALL FOUR SEASONS IN ONE DAY 
FAIR ENOUGH YEAH THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
YES I MEAN LOOK AT THAT YOU'VE GOT SNOW ON THE MOUNTAINS AT THE BACK THERE WINTER 
WE'VE GOT SUN ON THE WATER SO THAT'S LIKE SUMMERY 
I'M ABOUT TO WALK THROUGH SOME GORSE LIKE AUTUMN 
AND IT'S RAINING ON US LIKE AN ENGLISH SUMMER 
BUT AS A CAMERAMAN ALL THIS VARIETY AND THIS CHANGEABILITY 
IS THAT A CHALLENGE OR IS IT AN INSPIRATION I LIKE IT 
I REALLY LIKE IT IT MAKES IT EXCITING COS YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET 
ALL RIGHT WELL YOU'VE TALKED YOURSELF INTO IT 
SO I'D LOVE YOU PLEASE TO CAPTURE THIS AREA 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS THE WEATHER CHANGES O. K. 
O. K. SO IT'S JOHN AITCHISON TRIPS THE LIGHT FANTASTIC 
WHILST BILL ODDIE GOES AND HAS A NICE CUP OF TEA IN THE WARMTH AND DRY O. K. 
OR SHOULD I SAY A NICE CUP OF CHAI 
I KNOW JUST THE PLACE 
PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME WHERE I LIVE 
BUT I THINK THEY'RE A BIT DISAPPOINTED WHEN I TELL THEM 
BECAUSE THEY TEND TO THINK I OUGHT TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY 
AND IN FACT I'VE ACTUALLY READ SEVERAL TIMES IN NEWSPAPERS 
THAT I LIVE IN NORFOLK BUT I DON'T BECAUSE I LIVE HERE 
NO NOT INDIA NORTH LONDON 
IN FACT ONE OF THE REASONS I LOVE LIVING IN LONDON IS THAT THERE ARE PLACES LIKE THIS LITTLE INDIA 
INDIAN CULTURE INDIAN COSTUME INDIAN FOOD AND OF COURSE INDIAN WILDLIFE 
INDIAN WILDLIFE IN BRITAIN 
WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT I DUNNO 
OH P. F. F. UM NOW THAT'S INTERESTING 
HERE IT STRETCHES TO ABOUT A PIGEON 
BUDGERIGAR IN REGENT'S PARK KINGFISHER PARROTS EAGLE 
DO YOU GET PARROTS PARTRIDGE GOLDEN PHEASANTS 
WOODPECKER CHAFFINCHES A SORT OF DUCKY EAGLE MAYBE A PEACOCK 
PEACOCK PEACOCK PEA COCK 
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT PEACOCKS INDIAN 
PHEASANTS INDIAN 
JUNGLE FOWL INDIAN 
AND HERE IN RICHMOND PARK ANOTHER EXOTIC IMMIGRANT HAS MADE ITSELF AT HOME 
OH 
RING NECKED PARAKEET 
THEY DIDN'T ARRIVE NATURALLY THEY DIDN'T FLY IN FROM INDIA 
SO WHERE DID THEY COME FROM 
WELL THE MOST POPULAR THEORY IS THEY CAME FROM A FILM STUDIO 
THERE'S A LOT OF ROUND HERE SHEPPERTON VARIOUS OTHERS 
PROBABLY AN EARLY BOLLYWOOD MOVIE OR SOMETHING 
THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER THEORY WHICH I REALLY LIKE THAT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN JIMI HENDRIX'S PETS 
ONE THING IS FOR SURE THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ONE OR TWO OF THEM RELEASED 
PROBABLY A LITTLE FLOCK AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FOR SURE 
THEY ARE DOING EXTREMELY WELL 
YOU ARE EVERYTHING BY DIANA ROSS 
IN FACT ONE OF THEIR FAVOURITE ROOST PLACES 
AT ESHER RUGBY CLUB YOU CAN GO DOWN THERE IN THE WINTER 
AND SEE SOMETHING LIKE SIX THOUSAND BIRDS 
AND BELIEVE ME IT'S VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE 
MIND YOU BACK IN INDIA THEY'RE NOT QUITE SO WELCOME BECAUSE 
FLOCKS LIKE THIS DO GOBBLE UP FIELDS OF CORN AND SUCH THINGS 
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE NOT TOO KEEN ON THEM 
BUT THE QUESTION IS ARE THEY AFFECTING BRITISH WILDLIFE 
O. K. LET'S PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE SHALL WE 
WHAT POSSIBLE HARM CAN THESE PARAKEETS BE DOING 
DRIVING SONGBIRDS OUT KILLING SONGBIRDS DEFINITELY NOT 
POSSIBLY EATING FOOD THAT SHOULD BE GOING TO OTHER WILDLIFE 
THEY'RE EATING BUDS AND I KNOW THAT THE DEER IN RICHMOND PARK ALSO EAT BUDS 
BUT LET'S FACE IT DEER DON'T FLY TO THE TOP OF THE TREES SO IT CAN'T BE TOO MUCH OF A DAMAGE THERE 
THEY MAY TAKE FRUIT FROM PEOPLE'S GARDENS IN THE AUTUMN BUT NOT I DON'T THINK ON A GRAND SCALE 
AND MOST OF ALL THOUGH ARE THEY ACTUALLY COMPETING WITH OTHER HOLE NESTING BIRDS 
WELL I'VE GOTTA SAY THE ATMOSPHERE I'M GETTING RIGHT NOW 
IS NOT SO MUCH OF COMPETITION BUT OF CO EXISTENCE 
COS WE'VE GOT JACKDAWS WE'VE GOT WOODPECKERS 
WE'VE GOT PARAKEETS AND I'M NOT SEEING A GREAT DEAL OF FIGHTING 
THERE SEEMS TO BE ROOM FOR THEM ALL 
AND IN FACT IF ANYTHING I'D SAY THE JACKDAWS WERE THE AGGRESSORS 
I MEAN IF I HAD TO PICK A FIGHT PARAKEET OR A JACKDAW 
I THINK I WOULD GO FOR THE PARAKEET 
THEY'RE NOT AGGRESSIVE LOOKING BIRDS ARE THEY BE HONEST 
LIKE SOME BIG FRIENDLY BUDGIE 
AND IF AND IT IS IF 
WE DID EVENTUALLY DECIDE THEY ARE A PROBLEM 
WHAT WOULD WE DO ABOUT IT 
I MEAN COME ON THERE'S I DON'T KNOW WHAT TWENTY THOUSAND THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM NOW 
DO YOU SELL LICENCES TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO COME AND SHOOT PARAKEETS IN THE PARK 
I CAN'T REALLY SEE GUNSLINGERS BEING ALLOWED IN RICHMOND PARK POPPING AWAY AT PARAKEETS 
NO I THINK THEY'RE HERE TO STAY 
AND PERSONALLY I THINK THE WAY TO TREAT THEM IS WELCOME 
THEY'RE ANOTHER NEW EXCITING 
ETHNIC PART OF OUR BRITISH WILDLIFE 
AND THEY ARE BY THE WAY NOW OFFICIALLY BRITISH CITIZENS 
THE RING NECKED PARAKEET IN THE BIRD BOOK BRITISH CITIZEN YOU CAN TICK IT 
O. K. FROM INDIA TO SCOTLAND TO SEE HOW JOHN'S GETTING ON 
OH DEARIE ME LOOKS LIKE THE HIGHLAND MIST IS ROLLING IN 
IT'S WHAT THEY CALL A SOFT DAY UP THERE 
TODAY HAS TURNED OUT RATHER MISTY THIS MORNING 
AND RATHER MIDGY 
THE MIDGES LIKE CALM MISTY WEATHER LIKE THIS 
COULD DO WITHOUT THEM REALLY BUT WHAT DO THEY SAY 
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE WEATHER IN SCOTLAND WAIT A MINUTE 
I THINK IT'LL PROBABLY CHANGE QUITE QUICKLY 
BUT ACTUALLY HERE WITH ALL THE NEW LEAVES AND THE OLD BRACKEN AND THE COLOURS IN THE LANDSCAPE 
I THINK IT MIGHT BE QUITE NICE 
SO I'M JUST GONNA TRY AND FILM THOSE SORTS OF THINGS 
CONCENTRATE ON COLOURS AND SHAPES AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
WELL I HAVEN'T GOT PAST THE FIRST BIRCH TREE 
THIS TREE'S JUST FULL OF PATTERNS AND TEXTURES 
NORMALLY IF IT WAS SUNNY THIS WOULD ALL JUST BE HIDDEN IN SHADE 
YOU WOULDN'T SEE ANY OF THESE PATTERNS 
THE LICHENS GROWING ON THE TRUNK ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THE TEXTURES 
AND SUBTLE COLOURS IN THE TRUNK ITSELF ARE REALLY NICE TOO 
SO I'VE JUST BEEN DWELLING ON THE DETAILS REALLY 
THE WIDER VIEW IS JUST COMPLETELY GREY STILL BUT THIS TREE IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL 
UH UH 
WELL I DID SAY FOUR SEASONS IN A DAY 
HERE COMES THE MONSOON 
I'LL TELL YOU JOHN IF YOU CAN GET ANYTHING IN THOSE CONDITIONS L. FOR ONE WILL BE IN PRESSED 
SO WE SHALL LEAVE JOHN WITH THE WATER SLOWLY RISING UP HIS TROUSER LEGS 
AND GO TO MY GARDEN 
WHERE IT'S ALSO RAINING 
YOU SEE AS ONE CAMERAMAN TO ANOTHER I SYMPATHISE WITH JOHN BECAUSE 
LET'S FACE IT THIS SUMMER HASN'T BEEN 
WELL IT'S BEEN VERY VERY WET 
HOT DAYS WERE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN 
BUT WHEN THE SUN DID COME OUT SO DID THE WILDLIFE 
IN FACT I HAD SOME PRETTY EXOTIC CREATURES VISIT THE GARDEN 
WAH WAH WAH WAH 
ELLA I'M MINNIE MOUSE 
MINNIE MOUSE AS PLAYED BY GRANDDAUGHTER GRACIE AND DONALD DUCK BY ELLA 
THE MORNING SUNSHINE WAS JUST PLEASANT 
PERFECT FOR BUZZING AROUND OR RELAXING 
BUT BY MIDDAY EVEN THE BIRDS NEEDED TO COOL DOWN 
OR HOW ABOUT SUNBATHING 
BIRDS SUNBATHING OH YES 
IN FACT I EVEN PROVIDED A CUSTOM BUILT SUN DECK FOR THEM 
IDEAL FOR GREAT TITS 
BECAUSE THE GREAT TITS TOTALLY TOOK OVER 
AH THAT'S IT LOVELY GET THE SUN ON THAT 
ROOM FOR ANOTHER ONE OH I DON'T THINK SO NO WAIT YOUR TURN WAIT YOUR TURN 
THREE OH NO NO NO NO NO NO NO 
YOU'RE IN MY SPACE YOU'RE IN MY SPACE 
SHIFT OVER 
SO WHY DO THEY DO THIS 
WELL THERE'S QUITE A FEW THEORIES ACTUALLY 
IT'S POSSIBLY TO GET RID OF PARASITES 
MAYBE TO GET A FIX OF VITAMIN D. FROM THE SUNSHINE 
OR JUST TO CONDITION THEIR FEATHERS 
NOBODY'S REALLY SURE BUT MAYBE IT JUST FEELS GOOD CHILLING OUT 
OR MAYBE THEY WERE POSING FOR MY CAMERA 
ONE THING I DO KNOW IT'S THE SORT OF INTERESTING BEHAVIOUR 
THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY PLAN FOR 
ALTHOUGH NOT EVERYBODY FINDS IT QUITE SO FASCINATING 
ANYWAY WHILST WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT OF SUN SEEKING 
THEME FROM MIAMI VICE BY JAN HAMMER 
OH THIS IS NICE BLUE SKIES' 
I MUST SURELY BE IN FLORIDA 
IN WHICH CASE THERE SHOULD BE PELICANS AND MANATEES AND DOLPHINS 
BUT THERE AREN'T 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT IN FLORIDA 
I'M IN SCOTLAND 
NEVERTHELESS I THINK WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO DOLPHINS 
ALL WE'VE GOTTA DO IS FIND THEM 
IN THE NEXT SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS WE SHOULD BE LUCKY EVENTUALLY 
DOLPHINS WHERE ARE YOU 
THERE'S ONE 
YEAH THERE THERE SEE 
WELL WE'VE USED OUR EYES AND HAD TYPICAL VIEWS OF DOLPHINS I. E. 
OH THERE'S ONE OH GONE BEHIND YOU 
WHERE WHERE LEAPT IN THE WATER MISSED IT 
BUT THEY'RE HERE THAT'S THE MAIN THING 
AND IT'S NOW TIME TO USE OUR EARS OR RATHER TO USE CHRIS'S EARS 
YOU'VE BROUGHT YOUR EARS HAVEN'T YOU 
THERE THEY ARE 
I GUESS DOLPHIN NOISE IS ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH AT LEAST AREN'T THEY 
YEAH THE WHISTLES AND CLICKS I THINK THEY'VE HEARD IT SO OFTEN 
BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE ACTUALLY KNOWING THAT SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING AT 
IS ACTUALLY MAKING THE NOISES SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO YEAH 
WITH THE HYDROPHONES YEAH WE'VE GOT TWO 
IF YOU LIKE YOU CAN JUST SORT OF GENTLY CHUCK THAT OVER THE SIDE 
LIKE THIS LOOK 
OH YEARS OF PRACTICE IT'S THE WRIST THAT DOES IT THERE WE GO 
GOT WATER 
I CAN'T HEAR ANY DOLPHINS YET 
I'VE JUST GOT THAT VERY WATERY SLOSHING 
YOU'RE HEARING THE SAME AS ME WE'VE GOTTA WORK OUT A WAY OF TALKING TO EACH OTHER 
DO DOLPHIN LANGUAGE 
MIME 
I MEAN SOUND TRAVELS A HUGE WAY UNDERWATER DOESN'T IT IS THAT RIGHT 
IT TRAVELS FIVE TIMES FASTER AS WELL 
THIS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF SORT OF WIND THROUGH LEAVES 
YOU KNOW JUST THAT GENERAL THE AMBIENT SOUND OF THE OCEAN 
OOH THERE 
THAT'S THE ECHO LOCATION CLICK THAT CR R. R. R. R. R. OH YEAH 
THAT'S A DISTANT ONE 
THAT'S A RAPID PURRING LIKE A. I HEARD THAT 
YEAH 
WHAT THAT IS THEY'RE SCANNING FOR FOOD IT'S NOT A CALL 
IT'S AN ECHO LOCATION SOUND A BIT LIKE A BAT SO IT'S GOING T. T. T. T. T 
YEAH LIKE A RADAR SO IT'S SCANNING FOR FISH 
ACTUALLY WE'VE GOT SOME FOOTAGE FROM THE BAHAMAS OF A DOLPHIN 
DOING EXACTLY THAT A THOUSAND CLICKS PER SECOND 
CREATING THE SOUND IMAGE OF A FISH HIDING IN THE SAND 
THERE IT IS 
IN FACT TO SEA CREATURES IT'S LIKELY THAT SOUND IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN SIGHT 
THERE'S SOME FASCINATING THEORIES IN FACT ONE THAT JOHN TOLD ME 
JOHN AITCHISON YOU KNOW THESE ECHO LOCATION CLICKS THAT DOLPHINS HAVE 
IT'S LIKE THIS CREAKING SOUND 
THERE'S SOME THEORIES THAT IF YOU KNOW IF I'M LOOKING OVER THERE 
SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN'T SEE AND I SEE FOOD 
I CAN SCAN IT WITH MY ECHO LOCATION 
I CAN THEN TURN TO YOU AND BEAM THAT INFORMATION TO YOU 
AND WHAT YOU GET IS NOT A MESSAGE AS I'M DESCRIBING IT NOW 
BUT YOU GET AN IMAGE IN YOUR BRAIN OF WHAT I CAN SEE 
NOW THAT TO ME IS TELEPATHY MY GOD 
O. K. THEN FOLKS WHAT ARE THESE DOLPHINS TRYING TO TELL US 
I THINK ACTUALLY THEY'RE JUST LAUGHING AT US 
INTERESTING AS WELL THERE'S SOME WORK BEING DONE 
NOT FAR FROM HERE ABOUT THESE WE CALL THEM SIGNATURE WHISTLES 
AND IT'S EFFECTIVELY THEY GIVE EACH OTHER NAMES 
LIKE A MOTHER WILL GIVE HER CALF A NAME WHICH WILL BE A WHISTLE 
YEAH AND SHE'LL REPEAT IT AND SHE'LL REPEAT IT UNTIL 
THAT CALF LEARNS ITS OWN NAME OR SIGNATURE 
THROUGH THIS WHISTLING SOUND 
AND IT'LL KEEP IT I'M GOING TO CALL MY BABY 
YEAH HOW COOL IS THAT 
DON'T TELL BOB GELDOF IF HE HAS ANY MORE KIDS 
IT'S DOLPHIN SPLASHYWAY GELDOF SORRY BOB 
TELL YOU WHAT I CAN HEAR A VERY DISTANT BOAT ENGINE 
IT'S PROBABLY THAT ONE OVER THERE I MEAN WE CAN JUST SEE IT 
TO A DOLPHIN THAT WOULD BE WHAT THE DICKENS IS THAT 
WELL WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO LIVE YOUR LIFE OR COMMUNICATE 
OR REPRODUCE OR FIND FOOD YOU KNOW VITAL THINGS 
AND YOU HAVE THIS CONSTANT BACKGROUND NOISE IT MAKES LIFE REALLY DIFFICULT 
OUR OCEANS ARE JUST FULL OF NOISE POLLUTION BOTH FROM SHIPPING 
AND MILITARY ACTIVITY AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
AND I THINK WE'RE ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO REALISE YOU KNOW WHAT DAMAGE 
WHAT ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE THAT CAN CAUSE TO SEA LIFE 
I MEAN AS WELL AS DOLPHINS WHICH WE KNOW ARE HERE 
I MEAN I'M SEEING SEABIRDS IN THE BACKGROUND AND WHAT ABOUT OTHER FISH AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
WHAT ELSE COULD BE DOWN THERE MAKING NOISES WHERE WE ARE NOW 
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF SOUNDS A LOT OF FISH PRODUCE SOUNDS HADDOCK COD 
WHAT YOU DON'T MEAN A COD I NEVER THOUGHT 
COD'S GREAT GO ON WAIT A MINUTE LET'S HEAR SOME 
YES BUILD UP TO THIS O. K. THIS IS A COD 
A BIT LIKE THAT BUT A BIT BETTER I WAS CONVINCED I WAS CONVINCED I WAS 
I SUDDENLY HAD VISIONS OF CHIPS CAN'T YOU DO HADDOCK 
NO IT'S A BIT TRICKIER AW COME ON RORY BREMNER CAN 
YEAH YOU NEED A PROFESSIONAL FOR THAT HE DOES A GREAT HADDOCK 
IF YOU'RE DOING HADDOCK YOU NEED A PROFESSIONAL 
I DUNNO I COME OUT TO LISTEN TO THE MAGIC OF DOLPHIN SONG 
AND END UP WITH CHRIS DOING FISH IMPERSONATIONS 
CAN YOU DO TROUT CHRIS 
NEVER HEARD THEM 
OH YOU WANNA COME WITH ME THEN 
THESE ARE WALTHAMSTOW RESERVOIRS IN NORTH LONDON 
WELL STOCKED WITH TROUT AND OTHER STUFF 
WHICH ATTRACT NOT FISH IMPERSONATORS 
BUT ANGLERS AND OF COURSE WILDLIFE 
PLENTY OF HERONS THAT ONE'S GOT OH YEAH THREE LITTLE BABIES 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THESE CORMORANTS 
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT A CORMORANT IS DON'T THEY 
NOT OFF BY HAND NO NO 
IS THAT A BIRD CORMORANT 
I THINK IT'S A BIRD A FISHING BIRD 
SEABIRD IT'S A SEABIRD ISN'T IT A SEABIRD ISN'T IT LIKE A GULL 
NO NOT A GULL BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THEY ARE SEABIRDS' 
SO WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF LONDON 
THIS IS A PHENOMENON WHICH HAS INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS 
I REMEMBER SEEING THE OCCASIONAL ONE TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO 
AND THE FEELING IS THAT THESE ARE NOT REALLY BRITISH CORMORANTS 
THESE ARE EUROPEAN 
AND WE ALSO SUSPECT THAT QUITE A FEW ARE COASTAL BIRDS 
WHO'VE DECIDED TO MOVE INLAND AS WELL WHERE THE LIVING IS A LITTLE EASIER THAN AT THE COAST 
O. K. HERE'S THE CONTROVERSIAL BIT 
THIS IS AN ANGLING PLACE THE FISH AREN'T HERE NATURALLY 
FISH ARE PUT IN THE WATER FOR THE ANGLERS TO ANGLE FOR 
THEY CATCH 'EM THEY THROW 'EM BACK TO THE CORMORANTS THOUGH WELL WHAT D'YOU THINK 
IT'S A FREE MEAL AND THEY ARE THRIVING ON IT 
WHICH OF COURSE DOESN'T EXACTLY ENDEAR THEM TO THE ANGLERS 
MIND YOU ENDEARING ISN'T A WORD YOU'D USE ABOUT CORMORANTS 
IF YOU LOOK AT ONE OF THOSE BIRDS NOW SILHOUETTED AGAINST THE SKY 
NO COLOUR BIG HOOKED BEAK IT'S LIKE THE ANGEL OF DEATH UP THERE OR SOMETHING 
IN FOLKLORE GOING WAY WAY BACK THE CORMORANT HAS ALWAYS HAD THAT SORT OF REPUTATION 
IT WAS A BRINGER OF DOOM 
FISHERMEN WOULD SEE A CORMORANT AND THINK WE'RE NOT GOING FISHING TODAY 
SOMETHING AWFUL'S GONNA HAPPEN 
AND I'M AFRAID THAT REPUTATION HAS REALLY FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH 
A REALLY PRIMITIVE LOOKING BIRD 
IT'S EASY WHEN YOU SEE A CORMORANT TO FEEL THEY'RE MORE OF A REPTILE 
AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF BIRDS EVOLVING FROM SMALL DINOSAURS 
BECOMES FAR MORE BELIEVABLE 
THEY LOOK LIKE VULTURES REALLY DON'T THEY CAN'T SAY THE NOISE IS THAT PRETTY EITHER 
I DON'T KNOW AND MAYBE THIS IS UNFAIR TO SAY 
BUT I THINK SOME PEOPLE ALMOST WANT TO DISLIKE THEM 
I REMEMBER READING AN ARTICLE QUITE RECENTLY IN THE PAPERS 
AN M. P. MIND YOU WHAT DO THEY KNOW 
THERE WAS AN M. P. SAYING THAT HE'D BEEN ATTACKED BY A CORMORANT IN THE MAIN STREET OF A SEASIDE TOWN 
HE'D BEEN WALKING ALONG AND A CORMORANT CAME FLYING DOWN THE MAIN STREET AND ATTACKED HIM 
AND OF COURSE THAT'S ACTUALLY MISTAKEN IDENTITY 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A YOUNG GULL WHICH IS ALSO DARK 
THERE'S NO WAY A CORMORANT WOULD FLY DOWN A MAIN STREET 
BUT I THINK THAT'S TYPICAL OF THE GENERAL ATTITUDE 
AND THEY DON'T DESERVE THAT REPUTATION AT ALL 
LOOK AT THOSE SHAPES FOUR DIFFERENT SHAPES IN ONE SHOT 
I THINK THAT'S GORGEOUS 
SEE THE GULAR PATCH AND THE GULAR PATCH 
THERE'S A WORD YOU CAN USE AT DINNER PARTIES START A CONVERSATION 
WHAT'S A GULAR PATCH IT'S THE THROAT AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S PANTING THERE 
THAT BIRD IS PANTING COS IT'S GETTING QUITE HOT AND SUNNY 
OH OH 
WHAT ON EARTH HAS HE GOT 
IT'S JUST A RATHER DEMENTED ADULT PROBABLY WELL KNOWN IN THE COLONY 
KNOWN AS BAGGY OR SOMETHING OH GOD HE'S GOT ANOTHER ONE 
ACTUALLY I THINK THEY ARE ENDEARING 
AND LOOK AT THAT THEY EVEN RECYCLE OUR RUBBISH 
IN FACT I THINK THEY'RE RATHER WONDERFUL 
AND THEY DEFINITELY DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE SUCH A DODGY REPUTATION 
I MEAN O. K. YES THEY DO TAKE THE OCCASIONAL TROUT BUT I'VE GOT A THEORY ABOUT THIS 
I THINK THE FISHERMEN COME HERE SPEND HOURS CATCHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
AND THEY SEE THESE BIRDS COME DOWN THEY GO WITH A FISH 
THEY'RE JEALOUS THAT'S ALL THEY'RE JEALOUS 
WELL I'M CERTAINLY NOT JEALOUS OF YOU JOHN 
HAVE YOU MANAGED TO FILM ANYTHING YET 
ONLY JOHN AITCHISON COULD TURN A FILTHY DAY INTO AN ART FORM 
OH AND HE EVEN MANAGED TO GET SOME WILDLIFE 
WELL HERE'S A CHANGE THE SUN'S COME OUT AS YOU CAN SEE 
AND IT'S TRANSFORMED THE PLACE 
EVERYTHING'S GONE BRIGHT THE COLOURS ARE ZINGING THE LEAVES ARE AMAZING 
AND THEN UP ON THE HORIZON THERE PINE TREES SCOTS PINES 
JUST SILHOUETTED AND THESE AMAZING CLOUDS 
REALLY STRONG TONES REALLY DARK 
I LOVE IT WHEN IT'S LIKE THIS IT'S REALLY EXCITING 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH WAY TO LOOK ALMOST 
ONE MINUTE SOMETHING'S HAPPENING OVER HERE 
AND THIRTY SECONDS LATER IT'S SHIFTED AND THE LIGHT'S OVER HERE INSTEAD 
ALL THE LITTLE DROPS ARE LIKE LENSES 
SO ALTHOUGH THEY'RE UPSIDE DOWN YOU GET A PICTURE OF THE WOOD AROUND 
IT'S LIKE A MINIATURE WORLD JUST HANGING ON THE BRANCH 
WITH ALL THE TREES GROWING DOWNWARDS 
WELL DONE JOHN FOUR BEAUTIFUL SCOTTISH SEASONS IN A DAY 
AND AS A BONUS THE ENTIRE NATION IS IN A TRANCE 
BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP THREE TWO ONE CLICK 
YOU'RE BACK IN THE ROOM JUST IN TIME TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE NEXT SHOW 
IN WHICH I BECOME A GHOST BUSTER 
OH WHAT WAS THAT 
WHILST MY GARDEN ROBINS DO HELICOPTER IMPRESSIONS 
AND I PLAY SING ALONG A SEAL 
OH 
NOW COME ON LET'S DO IT 
THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS ARE OUT OF RETIREMENT 
YOU'RE MAURICE RILEY YOU'RE SYD WOOLSEY 
YOU'RE THE INVISIBLES 
ARGH 
THERE ISN'T A CAR I CAN'T DRIVE OR AN ALARM I CAN'T SILENCE 
OH OH 
THAT'S WHERE ALL THE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE COME FROM MAURICE 
YOU'VE GOT SKILLS THAT THE KIDS TODAY THEY JUST HAVEN'T GOT 
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A HITCH 
ALL RIGHT KEEP YOUR HAIR ON 
YOU TWO ARE MY GUIDING LIGHT 
DO THE CHECKS IN THIS JACKET MAKE ME LOOK CHUNKY 
HI HON NO IT'S FINE 
ME AND MAURICE ARE JUST HAVING A BIT OF A JOG 
CATCH THEM IF YOU CAN
