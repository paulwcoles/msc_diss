DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE ON A BUSY ROAD BECAUSE OF THE KIDS 
YES SOMEWHERE NICE AND SAFE EITHER A CUL DE S. A. C. OR A QUIETER AREA YES ALL RIGHT 
SO ANY NO NOS WHEN IT COMES TO PLACES 
PROBABLY STAPLEFORD O. K. WHY'S THAT I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN STAPLEFORD 
AND HAD GOOD TIMES AND BAD TIMES 
SO YOU'RE SCREWING YOUR NOSE UP AT STAPLEFORD YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED 
WHY DO YOU LIKE LONG EATON MY PARENTS LIVED IN BURTON ON TRENT 
WHICH IS WHERE I WENT BACK TO AFTER UNI AND I WORK IN MANSFIELD SO THIS 
IS KIND OF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AND I'VE GOT A FEW FRIENDS ROUND HERE SO THAT'S WHY I MOVED HERE 
TONY'S FAMILY ARE ALL HERE 
THE WORD ON THE STREET IS THAT YOU'RE A BIT OF A MUSIC FAN IS THAT TRUE YES I LOVE MUSIC 
AND YOU HAVE A BIT OF A COLLECTION 
ONE OR TWO O. K. AM I ALLOWED TO HAVE A LOOK YES OF COURSE YOU CAN 
SUPER COME ON LEAD THE WAY 
OH WOW NOW THIS IS A COLLECTION AND A HALF ISN'T IT YES THERE'S ONE OR TWO AIN'T THERE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT YOU'VE GOT SEVEN SINGLES YES TWELVE SINGLES AND ALBUMS 
L. P.'S I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THAT AGAIN 
THIS IS INCREDIBLE I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS AT ALL AND YOU'VE GOT TO FIND SOMEWHERE TO PUT ALL THIS LOT YES 
LET'S TALK ABOUT MONEY HOW MUCH DO WE HOPE TO HAVE TO BUY THIS HOUSE 
WE'RE LOOKING AT SPENDING AROUND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY POSSIBLY UP TO TWO HUNDRED THIRTY REALLY 
O. K. SO A PRETTY HEALTHY BUDGET FOR AROUND HERE YES IT'S NOT TOO BAD 
NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TONY BUT I DON'T TRUST JENNY ON HER OWN 
SO I'LL FIND HER CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER LOVELY ALL RIGHT CLAIRE 
SO I'LL GO AND HAVE A WORD WITH IAN THERE'S JUST ONE MORE THING BEFORE YOU GO 
IT'S EXCITING LOOKING FOR NEW HOUSES BUT I'D LIKE TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE EXCITEMENT IN FOR CLAIRE 
I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE TO HER IF THAT'S POSSIBLE 
NO YES AT SOME POINT IN THE SHOW THAT'S SO ROMANTIC YOU'RE JOKING 
NO I'D LOVE TO DO IT AND I THINK IT'S THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY 
TONY IT IS A LOVELY IDEA AND IT'S A FIRST ON TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY AS WELL SO WE'VE GOT TO KEEP THIS A 
SECRET THEN UNTIL YOU JUST DECIDE SOME WAY THROUGH THE SHOW TO POP THE QUESTION KEEP IT QUIET FROM IAN 
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD BUT A FANTASTIC IDEA I CAN'T BELIEVE IT SEE YOU LATER 
NOW ABOUT THIS PROPERTY I'VE HAD A WORD WITH THE LOVELY TONY HIS IDEAL PROPERTY WOULD BE ONE IN 
BETWEEN AN INDIAN RESTAURANT A PUB AND OPPOSITE THE FOOTBALL GROUND 
WELL THAT'S NOTHING THAT CLAIRE WANTS AT ALL 
SHE WANTS A BIG DETACHED FOUR BED RAMBLING HOUSE WITH RAMBLING ROSES IN THE BACK GARDEN 
OF COURSE THERE'S THE BIG SURPRISE WHAT BIG SURPRISE OH SORRY I CAN'T TELL YOU IT'S A SECRET 
YOU'LL FIND OUT BUT IT'S BIG 
RIGHT GOOD I'LL JUST GO TO THE ESTATE AGENTS ON MY OWN THEN IT'S GREAT 
CURIOUS NOW LONG EATON IS RATHER ATTRACTIVELY PLACED ON THE BORDERS 
OF BOTH NOTTINGHAMSHIRE AND DERBYSHIRE AMID SOME PLEASANT RURAL EAST MIDLANDS COUNTRYSIDE 
IT'S BORDERED BY THE NATIONAL FOREST AND SURROUNDED BY 
A PICTURESQUE CANAL NETWORK BELYING ITS INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE 
YOU CAN GET QUITE A LOT FOR YOUR MONEY IN THE AREA WITH 
DETACHED THREE AND FOUR BEDROOMED HOUSES COMING IN THIRTY TO FORTY THOUSAND 
LESS THAN THE AVERAGE PRICE FOR THE EAST MIDLANDS 
SO CLAIRE AND TONY'S BUDGET OF TWO THIRTY K. IS A POSITIVE BLESSING 
COMPARED TO SOME OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY 
WELL IN DRIGHLINGTON OUTSIDE BRADFORD YOU'D ONLY GET THREE BEDROOMS FOR THAT MONEY 
BUT THIS VICTORIAN STONE VILLA IS FULL OF CHARM AND CHARACTER AND IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR 
IF YOU HOPPED OVER TO ABERSOCH ON THE NORTH WALES COAST YOU COULD PICK UP THIS CHEEKY LITTLE BUNGALOW 
IT MAY ONLY BE TWO BEDROOMED BUT IT'S BEEN FULLY REFURBISHED INSIDE AND IS GREAT VALUE AT 
BUT IF YOU FANCY SOMETHING FLASH FOR YOUR CASH YOU COULD BUY THIS TWO BEDROOMED APARTMENT 
IN BIRMINGHAM'S JEWELLERY QUARTER A GOOD PLACE TO PICK UP RINGS I HEAR 
A SYMPHONY IN CHROME AND LEATHER AND QUITE A BARGAIN AT TWO TWENTY FIVE K. 
PICKING OUT RINGS WHAT ARE YOU ON ABOUT JENNY STICK TO LOOKING FOR A LOVELY PROPERTY IN LONG EATON O. K. 
HOW LONG IS LONG EATON THEN NOT LONG REALLY 
I'M SPEARHEADING A GROUP OF PROPERTY EXPERTS LOOKING FOR PROPERTIES ON BEHALF OF A LOVELY COUPLE 
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY CALLED IT LONG EATON DON'T LOOK AT ME IT'S ALL RIGHT 
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING CHEEKY SURPRISE ME 
BECAUSE IT'S LONG 
WELL I COULD HAVE SAID THAT BUT IT SOUNDED TOO OBVIOUS 
THEY'VE GOT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND TO SPEND IS THAT HEALTHY IN THIS AREA 
IT'S NOT A BAD BUDGET IN THIS AREA LONG EATON'S A GOOD MIXTURE 
OF TERRACED HOUSES RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH TO TOP END OF THE MARKET 
DON'T LAUGH BUT I'M LOOKING FOR A PLACE 
PLAICE YES I'VE GOT ONE THERE 
THEY NEED ABOUT FOUR BEDROOMS IN TERMS OF THEIR KIDS THEIR GROWING FAMILY SHE'S EXPECTING 
THAT LOOKS A VERY NICE PLAICE BUT IT HASN'T GOT FOUR BEDROOMS 
AND IT'S NOT IN THE RIGHT ROAD SO I'LL HAVE TO TURN THAT ONE DOWN 
I LOVE THIS ONE IT'S TRADITIONAL BUT IT'S MODERN 
IT'S GOT A CONTEMPORARY TWIST INSIDE AS WELL 
WINDS HOWLING DOWN IN LONG EATON AND YOU'VE STILL GOT YOUR SHORTS ON 
YOU'RE IN DENIAL HE'S GOT NO TROUSERS THAT'S WHY 
AND YOU'VE GOT LOVELY TANNED LEGS FANTASTIC I HAVE TO SAY THEY ARE FANTASTIC CALVES 
I CAN'T GET IN MY TROUSERS ARE YOU SPORTY HOW COME YOU'VE I'M VERY SPORTY LOOK AT THE SHAPE 
THAT'S A NICE ONE SLIGHTLY MORE MODERN

HOW HAVE YOU GOT ON ALL RIGHT LOOK AT THIS 
WOO HOO WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THAT 
WOO HOO APART FROM THE FACT IT'S BIG IT'S DETACHED AND IT'S GOT FOUR BEDROOMS 
H. M. M. M. M. SO LOCATION WISE IT'S NOT ON A MAIN ROAD IS IT

FOR ONE CLAIRE WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH IT 
BUT WHAT'S THE DOWNSIDE THE DOWNSIDE IS WHEN I SAY SPACIOUS THERE'S JUST ONE BEDROOM THAT'S 
NOT THAT SPACIOUS AND IT LIVES UP TO ITS NAME WHICH IS A BOX ROOM 
DID YOU SAY TO ME THAT TONY DIDN'T WANT TO LIVE IN STAPLEFORD

WOULD ALL MY RECORDS FIT IN HERE NO THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR HIS RECORDS SOMEWHERE SURELY 
THEY CAN BE HIDDEN AWAY SOMEWHERE ELSE I'M SURE THERE'LL BE ANOTHER ROOM FOR THAT THERE'S A SHED THERE

THEY'RE PART OF THE DESIGN OF THE HOUSE 
BATHROOM YES THAT'S ALL RIGHT ACTUALLY

WHITE SUITE I LIKE ALL THAT 
NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE LILAC BUT THAT'S EASY TO WHITEWASH

COT COT MIGHT BE A BIT TIGHT FOR DRAWERS AS WELL YES CAN WORK ROUND IT I'M SURE 
YES WORK ROUND IT WELL DONE TONY 
AH THIS IS NICE 
THIS IS A NICE SIZE IT IS JUST RIGHT ISN'T IT THIS'D BE BETTER FOR THE NURSERY 
WITH NURSERIES IT'S ALL RIGHT SAYING A SMALL ROOM BUT IT'S THE OTHER GUBBINS THAT GOES WITH IT 
I'D PREFER THIS TO BE THE NURSERY RATHER THAN THE OTHER ROOM 
YES THAT COULD BE YOUR MUSIC ROOM COULD BE 
ONE BIG CUPBOARD WITH RECORDS IN AND THAT'S IT LOCK THE DOOR 
WITH A SOUNDPROOF DOOR YES 
THE SECOND ROOM IS A BETTER NURSERY 
I GUESS THIS IS THE MASTER 
YES IT'S A VERY GOOD SIZE THIS ROOM 
YES WE COULD FIT A KING SIZE BED IN HERE 
SO YOU'RE NOT NICKING MY SPACE ALL NIGHT AS YOU USUALLY DO 
THAT'S SO WRONG 
OH IS THAT WHAT SHE DOES TO BE FAIR WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT 
YOU'RE ALL HOT AND BOTHERED YOU'RE WRITHING ROUND 
YOUR TEMPERATURE GOES UP I'M NOT SURPRISED SHE'S FIDGETY AND GOING INTO HIS SPACE 
IT'S REALLY BIG WHEN YOU LOOK THEY'VE GOT TWO DOUBLE WARDROBES IN HERE ALREADY YEAH 
TWO OF THESE BEDROOMS ARE A VERY GOOD SIZE BOTH DOUBLES BIG YES 
TWO OF THESE BEDROOMS ARE POKY 
THIS IS A GOOD SIZE 
YES THIS'D EASILY FIT LIKE A DOUBLE WOULDN'T IT 
NOW YOU COULD GET A KING SIZE BED IN HERE I'D ALMOST CHOOSE THIS AS MY MASTER BEDROOM YOU KNOW 
IT'S A REALLY NICE SIZE FOR SAM AS WELL YOU KNOW IF WE HAD CONNOR CONNOR AND SAM 
BUNK BEDS THIS'D BE PLENTY OF ROOM PUT BUNK BEDS IN HERE YES 
THAT'S YOUR COMPROMISE ISN'T IT IT'S A BIG ENOUGH BEDROOM TO HAVE TWO BEDS IN HERE 
I THINK JENNY'S MADE A REALLY GOOD FIRST CHOICE 
YES DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO AND TELL HER YES LET'S GO AND FIND HER AND TELL HER 
COME ON THEN WHAT IT'S TIME TO GET YOUR PAT ON THE BACK OH 
NOW THE FIRST THING I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU TWO IS WELL DONE FOR NOTICING THE FLOORS 
THE FLOOR IN THE CONSERVATORY IN PARTICULAR WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT IT'S LOVELY YES IT'S GREAT 
AND I MEAN FOR A NEW ADDITION TO A NINETEEN THIRTIES HOUSE IT JUST ALL LOOKS FANTASTIC DOESN'T IT YES 
YES WE REALLY LIKE THE CONSERVATORY 
YES IT'S A FANTASTIC ROOM SO YOU LIKED A LOT OF THE HOUSE DIDN'T YOU YES 
AND I JUST THOUGHT I'D SHOW YOU THIS DOUBLE WHAMMY HERE BECAUSE LOOK AT THE GARDEN 
M. M. M. THIS IS I THINK FOR A FAMILY 
IT'S ALL ENCLOSED IT'S SAFE 
IT'S ENCLOSED IT'S SAFE 
THERE'S A BIT OF EVERYTHING HERE FOR EVERYONE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR FRIENDS OVER 
AND IMAGINE YOURSELF SITTING ON THE DECKING 
YOU'VE GOT A BIT OF GRASS FOR SAM A TRAMPOLINE FOR THE OLDER ONES IT GOES ON AND ON 
IT'S A LOVELY MATURE GARDEN IT'S IN KEEPING WITH THE NINETEEN THIRTIES HOUSE I THINK YOU'VE MADE A VERY GOOD CHOICE 
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR FANTASTIC 
AND HOPEFULLY WHAT IT'S UP FOR WILL BE A BONUS AS WELL 
BUT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR 
SURPRISE I'VE SOLVED YOUR PROBLEM WITH THE BEDROOMS HAVE YOU TONY I'VE BEEN IN THE SHED 
I HEAR THAT YOU DON'T LIKE PICKING UP POWER TOOLS TOO OFTEN 
NO GET RID OF ALL THE POWER TOOLS THERE'S A LOVELY BEDROOM THERE 
THAT'D BE PERFECT WOULDN'T IT GET HIM OUT THE HOUSE 
MAKES A CHANGE FROM THE DOGHOUSE 
SO IT IS GUESS THE PRICE YOUR BUDGET WAS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY YEAH YEAH 
GO FOR IT GIRL 
OOH RIGHT I THINK ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN 
O. K. TONY 
I THINK IT'S LESS THAN THAT TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN 
NO NOT MUCH H. M. M. INTERESTING THERE COS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY WRONG 
COME ON 
YOU'RE CLOSEST THOUGH CLAIRE THE ASKING PRICE IS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY OH RIGHT O. K. 
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE OWNERS OF THE HOUSE ARE 
LOOKING TO MOVE TO SPAIN SO THINGS COULD BE NEGOTIABLE WHO KNOWS 
YES YOU COULD GET THE PRICE ROUND A BIT MORE WHERE YOU WENT FOR IF YOU MAKE A CHEEKY LITTLE OFFER YES 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
I THINK THAT'S REASONABLE ACTUALLY YES 
THEY'VE DONE SOME NICE WORK TO IT 
THEY HAVE YES IT'S A GOOD FAMILY HOME AND YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE BEDROOMS 
LET'S GO FIND SOME BEDROOMS IN PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
RIGHT ALSO RIDING HIGH IN THE PROPERTY CHARTS IS MY SUGGESTION NUMBER TWO 
WHICH SHOULD BE NUMBER ONE IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN WHICH IS ALSO HIGH IN CHARM CHARACTER AND BEDROOMS 
IN FACT JENNY LARGER BEDROOMS IN GENERAL THAN IN YOUR HOUSE 
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE BEDROOMS ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS HOW EXCITED I AM 
LET'S JUST STOP EVERYTHING WHAT IS GOING ON I'M NOT TELLING YOU EVEN IF YOU GET DOWN ON BENDED KNEE 
WEIRDO 
O. K. CLAIRE AND TONY COME ALONG TO PROPERTY NUMBER TWO IT'S MY CHOICE 
AND I THINK RESEARCH TELLS ME THAT WE'RE IN A LITTLE BIT OF A BETTER AREA 
TONY YOU'RE A LOCAL MAN CAN YOU TELL ME IT'S NOT A BAD AREA AT ALL REALLY 
O. K. AND THIS HOUSE I'VE FOUND YOU JENNY KIND OF GAVE YOU FOUR BEDROOMS 
I'VE REALLY GIVEN YOU FOUR BEDROOMS 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT IT IS IT'S BEEN IN THE SAME FAMILY SINCE IT WAS BUILT 
THAT MEANS IT'S BEEN EXTENDED AND FOR ME THE WORD TO SAY ABOUT IT IS POTENTIAL 
BECAUSE I THINK WITH REWORKING THIS HOUSE COULD BE EXACTLY WHAT YOU TWO ARE LOOKING FOR 
I'VE JUST GOT ONE QUESTION CAN I JUST ASK WHY WE STARTED TALKING ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE 
AS OPPOSED TO BEING MUCH CLOSER TO THE HOUSE OVER HERE WELL THE ROAD IS A LITTLE BIT BUSIER 
SO WE'RE ON A MAIN ROAD THANKS FOR ADMITTING THAT WE CAN CARRY ON 
SO PERSONALLY SPEAKING WHAT ABOUT FIRST IMPRESSIONS FOR YOU 
WELL THE MAIN ROAD IS A WORRY FOR THE KIDS BUT I'VE NOTICED HIGH HEDGEROW ALL THE WAY ROUND 
HOPEFULLY TWO STRONG GATES THERE TO KEEP THE KIDS IN AND KEEP OTHERS OUT YES 
WHAT ABOUT YOU CLAIRE YES 
HMM WE'LL SEE IT LOOKS NICE FROM THE OUTSIDE 
AND I'M SURE INSIDE'S GOING TO BE FANTASTIC 
OF COURSE IT IS POTENTIAL REMEMBER IS THE WORD TO USE HERE 
WHAT YOU HAVE GOT WITH THIS HOUSE IS YOU'VE GOT A GARAGE 
YOU'VE GOT LOADS OF OFF STREET PARKING AND RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE IS A SPEED CAMERA 
SO TRAFFIC CALMING IS RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR SO THAT MEANS IT'S NOT FAST GOOD POINT 
WELL YOU KEEP SAYING YOU WANT TO GO IN SO WHY DON'T YOU GO IN AND WE'LL HEAR WHAT YOU THINK 
SEE YOU WHEN YOU COME OUT O. K. FANTASTIC THANK YOU 
YES YOU NEED THAT SPEED CAMERA BECAUSE YOU'LL BE RUNNING SO FAST 
WHEN YOU REALISE WHAT A MISTAKE YOU'VE MADE YOU'LL NEED IT 
OOH 
WELL IAN TEN OUT OF TEN FOR EFFORT BUT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED REALLY COME ON 
THIS IS QUITE MODERN DIDN'T EXPECT THAT 
SO SO FAR THE UNEXPECTED HAS BEEN EXPECTED AH 
NICE YES IT'S DONE REALLY NICELY 
I LIKE THE RADIATORS 
DO YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS IT'S BECAUSE THE MAN WHO LIVES IN THIS HOUSE SELLS RADIATORS 
DINING ROOM THAT'S A FAIR SIZE 
IT IS THAT'S O. K. PROBABLY REDECORATE 
NOW IS SHE BEING POLITE THERE OR JUST GENUINELY OBSERVANT 
I LIKE THE KITCHEN NO WORK TO DO AT ALL IS THERE 
THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD SIGN 
AT LEAST TONY DIDN'T SAY OH THIS IS YOUR ROOM THE KITCHEN 
NO THAT'S A QUITE A PRACTICAL KITCHEN IT'S BIGGER THAN MINE AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT THE FLOOR'S O. K. 
O. K. TALKING OF FLOORS THEY DON'T HAVE TO NOTICE THE FLOORS IN THIS ONE IT'S JUST MY PROPERTY GUYS 
VERY NICE FIREPLACE LOVELY CARPET 
THAT CAN EASILY BE CHANGED THIS IS A GOOD PROPORTIONED ROOM IT'S REALLY SQUARE 
IT'S GOT A REALLY WARM FEELING ABOUT IT 
SHE'S MUCH MORE UP ABOUT THIS PROPERTY THAN MY ONE 
IT'S REALLY MODERN FOR AN OLD HOUSE 
YES I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT AT ALL NO 
IT FEELS LIKE A HOME DOESN'T IT 
IT DOES COSY YES 
WELL I THOUGHT THEY BOTH LIKED CHARACTER PROPERTY SOMETHING A BIT OLD BUT MAYBE NOT 
WHAT'S BEHIND THERE THAT LOOKS REALLY INTERESTING 
YOU'RE THINKING MUSIC AREN'T YOU YES 
THIS CONSERVATORY I'D BE INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT THEY THINK 
WOW I LIKE THIS 
H. M. M. LOOK AT ALL THIS SPACE YES YOU COULD PUT YOUR DINING TABLE IN HERE OR YOUR TOY ROOM 
YES IT COMPLETELY FREES UP THAT FRONT ROOM WHICH I PRESUME WOULD BE THE DINING ROOM 
I'M NOT GREEDY TO HAVE THIS AS MY MUSIC ROOM I WOULD TAKE THE SMALLER ROOM FOR THE MUSIC 
YES I'M NOT GENEROUS ENOUGH TO GIVE YOU THIS FOR YOUR MUSIC ROOM 
THE AREA THAT YOU CALL THE CONSERVATORY SHOULD IN FACT BE THE DINING ROOM 
I THINK THE FRONT ROOM SHOULD LEAD INTO THE BACK ROOM YES 
YOU COULD HAVE A DECENT SIZED POOL TABLE IN HERE FOR THE BOYS RATHER THAN IN THEIR LITTLE ONE 
I HOPE THIS IS A GIRL AND BALANCES THINGS OUT A BIT 
NO I THINK IT'D BE GREAT YOU COULD SECTION IT OFF A BIT COULDN'T YOU 
YOU COULD HAVE A PLAY AREA AND IT KEEPS THE HOUSE COMPLETELY FREE OF TOYS YEAH 
AH SHE SOUNDS A LOT MORE EXCITED 
VERY POSITIVE ABOUT THIS SHE'S GOT MORE IDEAS WITH THIS PROPERTY AND 
IN GENERAL I THINK SHE THINKS IT'S A MORE CHILD FRIENDLY HOUSE 
OOH I LIKE THE STAIRCASE NICE AND BRIGHT 
YES BIT GRANDER ISN'T IT 
THEY LIKE THE STAIRCASE GRANDER THAN YOURS WHICH I'M SURPRISED ABOUT 
H. M. M. BECAUSE THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD STAIRCASE 
THE STAIRCASE WAS YOUR BIG SELLING POINT I THOUGHT HOW BIG'S THIS 
I DIDN'T KNOW IF WE WERE GOING TO GET IN THEN 
AAH THIS IS ALL RIGHT ISN'T IT 
GOOD SIZED KID'S BEDROOM WHEN SHE SAYS THAT SHE'S SAYING THIS IS THE SMALLEST ONE IS IT YES 
HUGE WARDROBES TAKING UP HALF THE ROOM 
BET IT'LL LOOK MASSIVE IF YOU TAKE ALL THE FURNITURE OUT 
I BET YOU COULD AT A PUSH GET A SMALL DOUBLE BED IN HERE AS WELL 
YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT A DOUBLE BED IN THIS BEDROOM THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM IN THE OTHERS 
AH THIS SUITS YOU I THINK 
IT'S MY COLOUR ISN'T IT IT IS ISN'T IT DEFINITELY MY COLOUR 
I GUESS THIS WOULD BE THE NURSERY AND I THINK THIS IS QUITE A NICE SIZE FOR A NURSERY 
SHE'S GETTING THE VISION ISN'T SHE SHE GOT THE VISION I LOVE CLAIRE 
PLENTY OF ROOM FOR YOUR CHANGING AREA YES IT WOULD BE A ROOM THAT THEY COULD GROW UP IN I THINK YES 
AHH ISN'T THAT NICE YES 
IAN'S DONE GOOD SO FAR HASN'T HE I KNOW SORRY JENNY 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT TONY PFFRT 
I'M LIKING THIS A LOT SO FAR 
YES IT'S NICE COS THERE'S CHARACTER IT'S NOT LIKE SOME OF THE NEWER HOUSES 
THERE'S JUST LIKE A SQUARE YOU'VE GOT A DOOR DOOR DOOR DOOR THIS IS A BIT MORE INTERESTING 
OOH NICE 
BEAUTIFUL BATHROOM IT'S QUITE STYLISH ISN'T IT THIS BATHROOM 
IT COMES AS A BIT OF A SHOCK THE REST OF THE HOUSE IS ONE KIND OF STYLE AND YOU GO IN THE BATHROOM 
I LIKE THIS ACTUALLY 
I'M NOT REALLY A BLACK AND WHITE PERSON 
BUT I LIKE IT I LIKE THE LOOK OF THAT BATH 
IT'S ALL SO NEW I NEVER THOUGHT FROM A MINUTE FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT IT'D BE SO NEW INSIDE 
THEY LIKE THE DECOR THEY LIKE THE DECOR THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE AND THEY LIKE THE LAYOUT 
ANOTHER GOOD SIZED ROOM 
I THINK I PREFER THIS FOR SAM'S ROOM BECAUSE IT'S GOT A BIT MORE SPACE 
I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO GIVE SAM THE SPACE THAN THE SPARE ROOM SPACE REALLY 
BUT IF THE TRAFFIC IS A BIT LOUD AT LEAST SAM'S AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
HE'LL GET USED TO IT 
LET ME TELL YOU I LIVE ON A REALLY BUSY MAIN ROAD THE M. ONE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE ROOM UPSTAIRS IN THIS HOUSE 
I KNOW IT FEELS LOVELY DOESN'T IT 
I CAN IMAGINE LITTLE UNS BOMBING ROUND HERE ON CHRISTMAS DAY TRYING TO FIND SANTA 
CHRISTMAS MORNING THE FIRE ROARING THE TREE THE KIDS ALL DUH DUH DOWN THE STAIRS 
CAN I JUST SAY ONE THING BAH HUMBUG 
WOW IT'S EVEN BIGGER FANTASTIC 
COR LOOK AT THE WARDROBES THEY MUST TAKE UP HALF THE ROOM AS WELL 
AH HAPPY DAYS COS ALL THAT MEANS IS LADIES YOU HAVE TO FILL 'EM 
I LIKE IT I LIKE IT A LOT SO CHEESY 
DO YOU KNOW THAT BUSY ROAD OUT THE FRONT YES I RECKON IT'S GOING TO GET EVEN BUSIER 
WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE HITCHING FOR A LIFT HOME BECAUSE THE LOSER WALKS HOME 
I RECKON YOU TWO ARE ALMOST AS EXCITED AS ME ABOUT THIS HOUSE 
YES WE ARE SURE WE ARE MMM I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN 
HOW WE REWORK DOWNSTAIRS BUT YOU'RE NOT THAT FUSSED ARE YOU 
NO IT'S LOOKING ALL RIGHT AS IT IS I THINK YES 
I THINK WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CLEVER THINKING IN THE FUTURE 
YOU CAN MOVE INTO THIS HOUSE LIVE IN IT AND THEN IN YEARS TO COME I JUST THINK YOU COULD MAKE THIS 
FRONT ROOM FLOW INTO THIS ROOM WITH THE DOUBLE DOORS 
THERE'S ROOM FOR A DOWNSTAIRS TOILET 
YOU COULD OPEN YOUR KITCHEN UP IT'S GOT BAGS OF POTENTIAL THAT'S THE EXCITING THING 
YOU LIKE IT ANYWAY YES SO LET'S GO INTO THE GARDEN 
SOMETHING I NOTICED WHEN I FIRST HAD A LOOK AT THIS PROPERTY 
WAS THAT YOU'RE NOT OVERLOOKED IT'S VERY PRIVATE 
AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW BUSY THE ROAD WAS NOT THAT NOISY THOUGH IS IT IT ISN'T 
NOT REALLY NO SO ALL ENCLOSED THERE'S YOUR GARAGE 
AND IF IT'S NOT QUITE BIG ENOUGH THIS GARDEN THERE'S ROOM FOR ANOTHER GARAGE 
SO YOU COULD TAKE THAT ONE DOWN MOVE IT OUT FURTHER SO INCREASE THE SIZE OF YOUR GARDEN MASSIVELY 
YES WE'RE NOT EVEN BOTHERED ABOUT HAVING A GARAGE TOO MUCH ARE WE REALLY 
NOT JUST MOVING IT BACK YOU COULD TAKE IT FURTHER UP THE DRIVE 
COULDN'T YOU SO YOU'RE USING MORE OF THAT SPACE 
IT'S A BIG PLOT I THINK THAT'S THE KEY TO IT YEAH I THINK WE NEED A SIT DOWN I'M SO EXHAUSTED 
WE'RE JUST SAYING WHAT A GOOD HOUSE THIS WAS JENNY 
YES AND HOW QUIET IT WAS OUT HERE 
YES IT'S QUITE QUIET BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT I THINK IT'S ABOUT WHAT THE GUYS THINK TO BE FAIR 
IF YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS PROPERTY GREAT AND HAVE YOU FALLEN IN LOVE WITH IT YES 
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE TO SEE THAT'S IT VERY PRACTICAL 
AND BEFORE ALL OF THAT WE'VE GOT TO GUESS THE PRICE OF THIS BEAUTY 
CLAIRE'S A BIT SMUG TONY SO YOU'VE GOT TO BRING HER BACK ON LEVEL BUDGET TWO HUNDRED THIRTY 
YES I THINK IT'S SLIGHTLY OVER OUR BUDGET ACTUALLY O. K. 
I THINK TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THERE'S A LOT MORE TO THIS HOUSE THAN THE OTHER ONE 
O. K. ANYWAY CLAIRE MOVING ON HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK 
I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLOSE 
TO OUR BUDGET ACTUALLY 
I AGREE IT'S MORE BUT I THINK ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE 
SORRY I'M LAUGHING ALREADY BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE THINKING 
WHAT HE'S THINKING OH NO I'VE BLOWN IT AGAIN AND YOU HAVE 
BECAUSE THIS HOUSE IS ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WOW 
REALLY AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE AREA 
BUT THE OWNERS OF THIS ONE ARE EMIGRATING TOO THEY'RE GOING TO NEW ZEALAND 
SO AGAIN THEY'RE AFTER A QUICK SALE GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY ISN'T IT 
VERY GOOD REALLY GOOD 
LOOK AT HIS FACE HE CAN'T TAKE IT ALL IN 
I'M GLAD I WAS THAT WRONG COS I DO LIKE THE HOUSE AND IT'S A GREAT PRICE 
PERFECT YES CLAIRE'S GETTING EXCITED YOU WERE VISUALISING CHRISTMAS MORNING AT ONE POINT 
I KNOW I TRIED NOT TO BUT LIKE YOU SAY THERE IS ONE MORE 
PROPERTY TO SEE AND THAT IS THE WILD CARD SO THIS IS WHERE WE TRY 
AND TRIP YOU UP JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE THINGS COULD CHANGE ONCE MORE 
WE SHUFFLE IT ABOUT DON'T WE LET'S SHUFFLE AND FIND THE WILD CARD FANTASTIC 
FOR TODAY'S WILD CARD WE'RE CASTING OUR NET A LITTLE WIDER 
I KNOW IT'S NOT THEIR FAVOURITE AREA STAPLEFORD ANYONE 
BUT I KNOW THIS IS THE RIGHT PROPOSAL I MEAN PROPOSITION 
ARE YOU TIRED OR SOMETHING IS IT THE MUSIC YOU KEEP MAKING MISTAKES 
NO I'M FINE I JUST NEED TO GET MYSELF A BIT MORE ENGAGED WITH THIS PROPERTY 
O. K. GUYS WELCOME TO STAPLEFORD AND HERE WE ARE AT THE WILD CARD 
AND THE REASON IT'S THE WILD CARD IS COS YOU SPECIFICALLY SAID TO ME 
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN STAPLEFORD SO THERE YOU GO 
I CERTAINLY DID YES YOU USED TO LIKE US DIDN'T YOU I DID I STILL DO 
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT STAPLEFORD BUT WHEN WE SAW THE HOUSE 
WE COULDN'T REALLY RESIST IT IT'S FIVE BEDROOMS 
IT'S BEEN LIVED IN BY THE SAME FAMILY FOR TWENTY NINE YEARS 
TWENTY NINE YEARS I MEAN WE'VE NOT BEEN BORN THAT LONG HAVE WE 
ANYWAY THEY'VE DONE LOADS OF WORK ON IT IT'S IN GREAT CONDITION 
AND YOU'RE IN THE CATCHMENT AREA FOR TWO GOOD SCHOOLS 
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS INITIALLY 
FIVE BEDROOMED HOUSE VERY INTERESTING PUB ACROSS THE ROAD 
PUB ACROSS THE ROAD WHICH I DID USED TO PLAY FOOTBALL FOR AT ONE TIME RIGHT THERE YOU GO 
CLAIRE WHAT DO YOU THINK IT LOOKS NICE I LIKE THIS KIND OF HOUSE ACTUALLY YES 
I THINK TO BE HONEST THE ROAD'S SLIGHTLY BUSIER THAN YOU WANTED 
BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR FIVE BEDROOMED HOUSE 
AND THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE GATES TO KEEP EVERYTHING ENCLOSED 
I THINK IT'S SET BACK ENOUGH REALLY 
AND IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL FAMILY HOME I THINK THAT'S THE FEELING YOU GET 
WE NEED TO GET YOU IN THERE AND WE'LL SEE YOU AGAIN AFTERWARDS

DINING ROOM I LIKE THE DINING ROOM

AND HAVE IT IN ONE BIG ROOM IN THE SUMMER OR MAKE IT REALLY COSY IN THE WINTER 
THERE'S A REAL SENSE OF FAMILY IN THIS HOUSE YOUR KITCHEN THE TRADITIONAL DINING ROOM 
THE DOUBLE DOORS THAT OPEN UP IN THE FAMILY ROOM FOR PARTIES 
THAT'S LOVELY I DO LIKE THAT 
YES SEE THIS IS LOVELY COS ALL THE KIDS STUFF CAN GO DOWN HERE

AND JENNY CERTAINLY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE WEDDING 
BUT LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THE HOUSE 
OUR TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY SURVEYOR HAS LOOKED OVER IT IT'S NOT LEGALLY BINDING 
SO YOU NEED TO GET A FULL SURVEY DONE YOURSELF A COUPLE OF THINGS HE POINTED OUT 
AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE WHERE IT'S BEEN RENDERED 
THEY'VE PROBABLY DONE THAT TO COVER UP WHERE THEY'VE DONE THE EXTENSION 
THERE ARE SOME HAIRLINE CRACKS ON THE FRONT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK OUT 
AND AT THE END OF THE HOUSE AT SOME TIME YOU JUST MIGHT WANT TO REPOINT THE BRICKWORK BUT NOTHING MAJOR 
NO AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT BIG IDEAS WITH THE GARAGE SO IF YOU ARE INTENDING ON DOING ANY WORK 
ON THE GARAGE THERE IS AN ASBESTOS ROOF THERE AT THE MOMENT 
SO OBVIOUSLY YOU'D NEED A SPECIALIST COMPANY TO COME IN AND REMOVE THE ROOF

TO BE HONEST I'VE NO IDEA BUT I'M PLEASED TO SAY
