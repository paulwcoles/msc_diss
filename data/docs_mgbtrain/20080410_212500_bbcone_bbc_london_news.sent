JUDGE THE JUDGE'S DECISION 
REVERSED SO THE ANIMALS CAN COME 
INTO THE OWNERSHIP OF THE CHARITIES 
INVOLVED IF THEY NEED TO BE REHOMED 
WE CAN FIND THEM SUITABLE HOMES WE 
DON'T FEEL PUBLIC AUCTION IS THE 
BEST OPTION YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO 
WILL BUY THEM IF WE HAVE OWNERSHIP 
OF THEM WE CAN FIND THEM SECURE 
HOMES WHERE THEIR WELFARE IS 
GUARANTEED
