HOW COULD YOU NOT THE BEST THING THAT I SAW DURING THAT PERFORMANCE 
WAS A MAN IN THE CROWD WEARING A CAPE WITH HIS FACE PAINTED WITH A TOP HAT 
WITH A TESCO SHOPPING BAG WHO WAS MOONWALKING 
THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN WITH MY EYES 
AND I'VE SEEN THE PYRAMIDS IT'S MADE MY DAY 
THAT WAS THE BEST THING WHO'S NEXT 
MAYBE PIGEON DETECTIVES CAN BETTER THAT LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
DOCTOR WHO THEME 
HI WE'RE PIGEON DETECTIVES 
OUR NEW ALBUM'S CALLED EMERGENCY 
IT HAS A ROBOT ON THE FRONT 
WE THOUGHT WE'D COME DOWN TO THE DOCTOR WHO EXHIBITION 
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF ROBOTS HERE 
LET'S GO 
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY BY PIGEON DETECTIVES 
JIMMI PERSUADED US TO COME DOWN AND CHECK OUT THE DOCTOR WHO EXHIBITION 
DON'T MAKE ME GO HOME 
MY GIRLFRIEND'S A BIG DOCTOR WHO FAN SO SHE WANTED ME TO COME DOWN AND MEET THE DALEKS 
DON'T MAKE ME GO DON'T MAKE ME 
EXTERMINATE 
EXTERMINATE 
THE REASON WE WENT FOR THE ROBOT WAS GOING BACK TO THE STRIKING IMAGE 
WE WANTED A COOL RETRO PICTURE 
IT KINDA STRUCK A CHORD OF COOLNESS 
IT FITS IN WITH THE TITLE AS WELL EMERGENCY 
IN THE ARTWORK THERE'S MARCHING ROBOTS 
IT'S ALMOST A BIT SINISTER 
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY 
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY 
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY 
IT'S NOT INTENTIONALLY SINISTER WE'RE NOT TRYING TO SCARE KIDS 
HE'S UGLY 
WE ALWAYS STRIVE TO WRITE THAT CATCHY CHORUS 
AT THE SAME TIME WE WANTED TO SHOW A DIFFERENT SIDE TO THE BAND 
I THINK THIS IS A BIT OF A DARKER SONG BIT MORE OF AN EDGE TO IT 
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING 
CAN WE STAY SOMEHOW 
IT COULD ALMOST BE A STATEMENT OF INTENT 
WE'VE COME BACK WITH A FRESH NEW ALBUM 
AND A DIFFERENT SOUND JUST SHOWING PEOPLE WE ARE COMING BACK WITH 
WITH SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT EDGY 
WOULD LEAVE ME ALONE 
PIGEON DETECTIVES REMEMBER WHEN THEY WERE ON SOUND ALL THE TIME
