GOOD EVENING CITY HALL WAS PLUNGED INTO CHAOS 
THIS MORNING AFTER A BURST WATER 
MAIN FLOODED ITS BASEMENT DOZENS 
OF OTHER PROPERTIES IN THE TOOLEY 
STREET AREA WERE ALSO AFFECTED AND 
SURROUNDING ROADS REMAIN CLOSED 
LUCKY THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN ON 
ELECTION DAY 
THE THIRTY SIX INCH WATER MAIN BURST 
WITHOUT WARNING AROUND NINE HUNDRED A M. THIS 
MORNING THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF 
WATER POURED DOWN THIS SERVICE 
TUNNEL FLOODING THE BASEMENT IN 
CITY HALL ALONG WITH DOZENS OF 
OTHER OFFICERS SHOPS AND HOTELS 
THE MAIN PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT IS 
ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES HAVE GONE DOWN 
IN SEVERAL OF THE BUILDINGS AS IT 
HAS TRIPPED OUT ONE OF THE 
SUBSTATIONS THE ELECTRICITY BOARD 
ARE ON SITE TRYING TO SORT THAT 
ISSUE OUT 
MANY HOMES IN THE AREA 
LOST THEIR WATER SUPPLY AND 
RESIDENTS HAD TO COPE WITH A FLOOD 
ON THE HIGH STREET 
I LOST MOST OF 
THE BUSINESS THIS MORNING IT WAS A 
BUSY DAY FOR ME ON SUNDAY AND I 
LOST MOST OF THE BUSINESS 
I WALKED 
ALL THE WAY FROM LONDON BRIDGE 
NEARLY THROUGH THE WATER TRYING TO 
GET HOME L. L. CAN'T GET HOME WITHOUT 
CROSSING THE WATER I'M EIGHTY TWO THAMES THAMES WATER SAY THEY DON'T KNOW WHY THE 
MAIN SUDDENLY BURST BUT THEY ARE 
NOT BLAMING NEARBY ROADWORKS IT 
SKOFRBL DAYS BEFORE THINGS GET BACK 
TO NORMAL 
IT COULD BE SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE 
THINGS GET BACK TO NORMAL 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE 
MARCHED THROUGH LONDON TO MARK A 
RALLY ABOUT RACISM 
IT IS AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN LIKE NO 
OTHER NO ONE CANDIDATE OR PARTY 
BUT THE POLICY TO VOTE FOR ANYONE 
EXCEPT THE B. N. P. IN THIS WEEK'S 
LONDON ELECTIONS 
WE STAND UP CLEARLY SAYING WE DON'T 
WANT THE B. N. P. BEING ELECTED WE WANT 
A MULTI RACIAL CITY OF LONDON WHERE 
EVERYONE IS WELCOME 
THIRTY YEARS AGO 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MARCHED THROUGH THE 
EAST END TO VICTORIA PARK AGAINST 
THE RISE OF THE NATIONAL FRONT 
TODAY MANY OF THE SAME FACES WERE 
THERE 
IN LONDON YOU HAD A SCENE THERE GOING ON WITH PUNK AND YOU ALSO HAD 
THE REGGAE BANDS IT WAS THE FUSION 
OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT CULTURES 
ALREADY COMING LIKE TODAY WE DON'T 
AGREE WITH NAZIS 
THERE ARE BIG 
NAMES IN MUSIC HERE TODAY HARD IF 
I. IS ON THE STAGE THERE ORGANISERS 
SAY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPECTED 
TO TURN UP HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE 
HERE FOR THE MUSIC AND HOW MANY FOR 
THE CAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL 
MAINLY FOR THE MUSIC 
BECAUSE IT IS 
FREE AND TO SUPPORT NON RACISM 
BECAUSE IT IS FREE 
IF PEOPLE ARE 
TURNING UP TO LISTEN TO MUSIC THEY 
WILL BE IN A GOOD MOOD AND ENJOY 
THEMSELVES AND THEY WILL BE MORE 
OPEN TO SOMEONE POINTING OUT WHAT 
THE B. N. P. ARE DOING 
EVEN THOUGH 
LONDON IS THE MOST MULTICULTURAL 
CITY IN THE WORLD THE EVENT IS AN 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THERE IS STILL 
A NEED TO FIGHT RACISM 
A MAN HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER 
AFTER A STABBING AT WHIPP'S CROSS 
HOSPITAL IN LEYTONSTONE A THIRTY FOUR YEAR 
OLD VICTIM WAS FOUND LYING IN A 
LEDING BAY WITH NECK WOUNDS LAST 
WEEK WEI MA WHO IS THIRTY SIX WILL 
APPEAR IN COURT TOMORROW 
B. B. C. LONDON HAS BEEN TOLD THAT A 
GRAND PRIX THROUGH THE STREETS OF 
CENTRAL LONDON HASN'T BEEN RULED 
OUT EVEN THOUGH TALKS REACHED A 
STALEMATE WITH FORMULA ONE BOSS 
BERNIE ECCLESTONE TODAY CARS AND 
DRIVERS FROM A ONE G. P. WORLD CUP CAME TO 
LOWER REGENT'S STREET YOU NEED A 
GOOD SET OF EAR DOING PLUSING WHEN 
YOU HEAR A ROAR LIKE THIS 
IF NOT YOU NEED TO HEAD FOR COVER 
JUST LIKE OUR CAMERAMAN WHO WAS 
CAUGHT A LITTLE BIT BY SURPRISE 
BUT AS FANS TURNED OUT A WEEK 
BEFORE THE FINALE OF THE A ONE G. P. WORLD 
CUP AT BRANDS HATCH ORGANISERS 
WERE KEEN TO SUPPORT A CIRCUIT IN 
THE HEART OF LONDON 
I BELIEVE 
LONDON IS ONE OF THE GREATEST 
CITIES TO HAVE A STREET RACE L. 
HOPE WE CAN BE AT THE STARTING 
BLOCKS BY BEING HERE AND SHOWING 
LONDON WE CAN PUT ON AN EVENT WE 
CAN DO IT AND HAVE DONE IT SUCCESS 
FLI I THINK TODAY IS 
SUCCESSFULLY I THINK TODAY IS JUST 
THE BEGINNING OF WHAT MAY BECOME A 
STREET RACE 
IT IS NEARLY FOUR 
YEARS SINCE FORMULA ONE GAVE US THE 
TASTE OF WHAT A LONDON GRAND PRIX 
WOULD LOOK LIKE THE IDEA TO CREATE 
A TRACK THROUGH THE CITY WAS PUT ON 
HOLD WHEN LONDON WON THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
OLYMPIC BID BUT B. B. C. LONDON WERE 
TOLD TODAY THAT THE PLAN COULD BE 
REVIVED AS THE DETAILS HAD ALREADY 
BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY'S DRIVERS 
WERE ALL IN FAVOUR OF A LONDON 
GRAND PRIX 
I THINK IT IS A DREAM 
OF A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY IF THEY 
COULD HOLD A RACE HERE IT WOULD BE 
AN AMAZING FEELING TO RACE THROUGH 
LONDON I THINK THE CROWDS YOU 
WOULD GET TO BE EXTREMELY 
SUCCESSFUL 
WITH MONEY AND GLAMOUR SUCCESSFUL THAT GRAND PRIX RACING BRINGS WE 
MAY JUST BE A FEW YEARS AWAY FROM 
SEEING LONDON'S FIRST RACE 
NOW THE 
WEATHER WITH CHRIS 
BOT YOU MAY WELL HAVE HEARD ONE OR 
TWO RUMBLES OF THUNDER BUT THE 
SHOWERS WILL FADE AWAY THE WEATHER 
WILL BECOME QUIETER AND FOR MOST 
THE WEATHER WILL BECOME DRIER 
THE LAST OF THE SHOWERS CLEARING 
OUT OF THE WAY A FEW CLEAR SPELLS 
HERE AND THERE AND SOUTH WESTERLY 
WINDS BRINGING A FAIR AMOUNT OF 
CLOUD ACROSS LONDON IT DOES MEAN 
IT WILL BE A MILD NIGHT 
TEMPERATURES AROUND EIGHT TO TEN 
MONDAY MORNING STARTING OFF WITH 
QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD AROUND FIRST 
THING BUT THE CLOUD WILL THIN AND 
BREAK UP WITH SUNNY SPELLS 
DEVELOPING COME THE AFTERNOON 
THERE IS A RISK WE WILL SEE SHARP 
SHOWERS AND ALSO SOME THUNDERSTORMS 
LINING UP AROUND THE M. FOUR A FEW OF 
THOSE SHOWERS TO THE SOUTH OF TOWN 
THE WEATHER GOES INCREASINGLY 
UNSETTLED ON TUESDAY HEAVY RAIN 
FORECAST FROM THE SOUTH IT DOESN'T 
GET MUCH BETTER LATER ON IN THE 
WEEK THAT'S IT GOOD NIGHT 
HELLO OUR WEATHER HAS TURNED 
PARTICULARLY LIVELY THIS AFTERNOON 
ACROSS CENTRAL AREAS OF ENGLAND 
MORE THUNDERY SHOWERS RUMBLING 
ACROSS THE MIDLANDS AND INTO 
NORTHERN ENGLAND IN THE NEXT FEW 
HOURS BUT TONIGHT THINGS WILL 
GENERALLY BECOME QUIETER WITH 
PATCHY OUTBREAKS OF RAIN MAINLY IN 
THE NORTH AND WEST MORE ACTION OUT 
OF OUR SHOWERS THIS EVENING 
CLIPPING INTO THE SOUTH EAST OF 
SCOTLAND BEFORE THEY FADE ALL TO 
THE NORTH EASTERN SCOTLAND LEFT 
WITH PERSISTENT RAIN BY THE END OF 
THE NIGHT BUT IN THE WEST JUST 
LIGHT AND WELL SCATTERED SHOWERS 
QUITE A LIGHT START EVEN WITH DRY 
AND SUNNY WEATHER ACROSS EASTERN 
AREAS OF ENGLAND BUT DON'T BE 
FOOLED TOMORROW THE SHOWERS ARE 
GOING TO BECOME WIDESPREAD ACROSS 
THE U. K. AND SOME WILL BE HEAVY AND 
POTENTIALLY THUNDERY AS WELL SOME 
OF THE TARGET AREAS FOR PERHAPS 
SOME OF THE LIVELIEST OF THE 
SHOWERS TOMORROW COULD BE SOUTHERN 
ENGLAND WE COULD SEE SIGNIFICANT 
DOWNPOURS PARTICULARLY LATER ON 
NOTICE THE TEMPERATURES LOWER THAN 
THE FIGURES WE HAVE SEEN THIS 
WEEKEND WE ARE INTO THE LOW TEENS 
FOR MONDAY MORE SHOWERS ACROSS 
WALES ON MONDAY AFTERNOON THEY 
WILL EASE AS THE AFTERNOON WEARS ON 
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND MORE SHOWERS 
NOT SO MUCH SUNSHINE FOR SCOTLAND 
PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH A 
GENERALLY CLOUDY SCENE AT THE 
OUTBREAKS OF RAIN BECOMING 
INCREASINGLY SHOWERY THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON FOR NORTHERN ENGLAND AND 
THE MIDLANDS ONCE AGAIN THE 
THREAT OF HEAVY AND
