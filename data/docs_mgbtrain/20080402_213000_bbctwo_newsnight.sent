PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS WON 
THIS ELECTION HAS WON THIS 
ELECTION 
MAYBE BUT WHEN IS ELECTION ROBERT MUGABE GOING TO GET THE 
MESSAGE 
WELL HE'S STILL THERE BUT HE'S IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE BIGGEST POLITICAL 
CRISIS OF HIS LIFE ROBERT MUGABE 
HAS LOST CONTROL OF PARLIAMENT HOW 
MUCH LONGER CAN HE CLAIM NOT TO 
HAVE LOST THE PRESIDENCY 
THE IRISH PRIME MINISTER RESIGNS 
AMID FINANCIAL SCANDAL WHAT DID HE 
ACHIEVE ACHIEVE SAY YOU'RE DOING A TEST JUST DO 
LITTLE BIT OF BRAIN GYM SAY IF 
YOU'RE STUCK IN MATHS TEST DO 
LITTLE BIT OF ENERGY ON AND YOU 
FIND THE ANSWER 
SHOULD WE BE 
SPENDING PUBLIC MONEY ENCOURAGING 
CHILDREN TO BELIEVE THIS SORT OF 
THING 
AND WHY DON'T YOU SEE JOKES LIKE 
THIS BEEN BI MUSLIMS ON THE B. B. C. 
ANY MORE A CHRISTIAN MUSLIM AND 
JEWISH COMEDIAN DEBATE WHEN GOD'S 
FUNNY 
GOOD EVENING OFFICIALLY WE ONLY 
KNOW THE RESULTS OF ELECTIONS TO 
THE ZIMBABWEAN PARLIAMENT BUT THEY 
ALONE ARE A KICK IN THE TITHE FOR 
ROBERT MUGABE OF THE TWO HUNDRED TEN SEATS 
FOR THE M. D. C. HAVE WON ONE HUNDRED FIVE WITH TEN 
SEATS WAITINGTOR DECLARED IF THEY 
FOLLOW THE SAME PATTERN MUGABE MAY 
HAVE TO FIGHT THROUGH A SECOND 
ROUND FIRST TONIGHT WE LOOK AT 
THE OPPOSITION'S PROSPECTS OF 
CLINCHING VICTORY 
THIS WAS ANOTHER DAY OF TWISTS AND 
SUSS EXPENSE IN THE ZIMBABWE 
ELECTION DRAMA WITH THE OPPOSITION 
MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE 
COMING OUT ON TOP FOR IT WAS 
AGREED OFFICIALLY THAT ROBERT 
MUGABE'S ZANU P. F. PARTY HAS LOST ITS 
MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT FOR THE 
FIRST TIME SINCE INDEPENDENCE TWENTY EIGHT 
YEARS AGO THE LATEST MASSIVELY 
DELAYED RESULTS ANNOUNCED BY THE 
MUCH CRITICISED ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION SHOW THE OPPOSITION 
M. D. C. ALONG WITH THE FACTION THAT'S 
BROKEN AWAY FROM THE LEADER MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI HAS WON ONE HUNDRED FIVE SEATS IN 
THE TWO HUNDRED TEN SEAT 
ASSEMBLYLY ZANU P. F. CURRENTLY HAVE 
NINETY THREE WHILE ONE HAS GONE TO AN END 
EVEN IF ZANU P. F. WIN ALL THE 
REMAINING SEATS IT WON'T HAVE 
ENOUGH FOR A MAJORITY THERE WILL 
BE NO OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT 
THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST BUT THE 
M. D. C. SECRETARY GENERAL NATALIE 
LEADBEATER CLAIM THEY'D WON THIS 
TOO WITH MORGAN TSVANGIRAI BEATING 
ROBERT MUGABE AND THE THIRD 
CANDIDATE SIMBA MAKONI EVEN 
PRODUCED FIGURES FROM THEALLIES 
POSTED OUTSIDE POLLING STATIONS 
THE OPPOSITION HAS WON THE ELECTION 
THE OPPOSITION IN THE MAJORITY AND 
ZANU P. F. HAS LOST THIS ELECTION 
ADVANTAGE ADVANTAGE ADVANTAGE HAS 
WON FIVE HUNDRED THREE PER CENT THAT MEANS HE IS ABOVE 
THE FIFTY PER CENT THRESHOLD ROBERT MUGABE 
WON FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MERS MERS REPRESENTED BY BY 
HE INSISTED IF THERE WAS A BY SHOWDOWN THE SECURITY FORCES OUT 
IN LARGE NUMBERS IN HARARE TODAY 
WOULD BACK MUGABE AGAINST THE 
OPPOSITION 
THE CAPACITIES TO OPPOSITION DEFEND THEMSELVES THEY DON'T HAVE 
AND THEY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH 
THE ACTION WITH THE ZANU P. F. CAN 
PROVOKE THE POLICE AND ARMY IF DO 
YOU THAT DEFINITELY THEY WILL 
REACT 
MUGABE MAY HAVE LOST HIS REACT PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY BUT THE 
GAME IS NOT OVER YET THE M. D. C. CLAIM 
ADVANTAGE ADVANTAGE ADVANTAGE WON 
OVER FIFTY PER CENT OF MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
WOVER OVER FIFTY PER CENT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 
VOTES BUT THE OFFICIAL FIGURES 
SHOW THEY BEAT MUGABE BUT GOT LESS 
THAN FIFTY PER CENT HE WILL HAVE TO FACE 
MUGABE IN THE SECOND ROUND JUST 
BETWEEN THE TWO CANDIDATES IT IS A 
SCENARIO THAT'S BEEN SUGGESTED BY 
THE STATE OWNED HERALD NEWSPAPER 
BUT IT IS UP TO MUGABE TO DECIDE 
WHETHER HE WILL GO FOR A SECOND 
ROUND IF THAT BECOMES AN OPTION 
THE M. D. C. SAY THEY WOULD ACCEPT A 
RUNNOFF BUT WOULD FAR PREFER FOR 
MUGABE TO GO NOW THEY ARGUE THIS 
WOULD AVOID EMBARRASSMENT TO THE 
MAN WHOSE CONTROLLED ZIMBABWE FOR 
THIRTY EIGHT YEARS 
THIS PARTY RULE CONTEST 
IN 
THE RUNNOFF BUT THE VOTE OUT FOR A NUMBER OF 
REASONS IN THE NUMBER OF REASONS 
BEING IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE 
PEOPLE WILL IN ANY WAY BE REVERSED 
IN THE RUNNOFF IF ANYTHING IF 
ANYTHING THEY WILL ACTUALLY BE AN 
EMBARRASSING POSITION IN THE 
OPPOSITION 
IF THERE'S A SECOND OPPOSITION ROUND THAT IS UNFORESEEN IN THE 
LEGISLATION THAT SECOND ROUND IN 
THE FREE AND FAIR POLL THIS TIME 
TSVANGIRAI DOES HOLD THE CARDS HE 
CAN DEMAND ALSO BETTER CONDITIONS 
AND DEMAND INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS 
AND CORRECTION OF THE CONDITIONS 
THAT WERE A PROBLEM THE VOTE 
BUYING SHOULD STOP THE DIRTY 
TRICKS SHOULD STOP 
TSVANGIRAI MAY 
HOLD MORE CARDS THAN EVER BEFORE IN 
THE BATTLE WITH MUGABE AND HAS 
CERTAINLY SHOWN BRAVERY HOW SHOULD 
HE BE JUDGED AS A POLITICIAN WELL 
HE STARTED OUT AS A MINE WORKER 
THEN HE BECAME A UNION LEADER AND 
SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE ZIMBABWE 
CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS NINE 
YEARS AGO HE FOUNDED THE M. D. C. AND 
SOON PROVED A CREDIBLE THREAT TO 
MUGABE MUGABE BUT THREE YEARS AGO HIS PARTY SPLIT 
INTO TWO FACTIONNESS A DISPUTE OVER 
TACTICS AMIDST ACCUSATIONS HE WAS 
BOTH INDECISIVE AND UNDEMOCRATIC 
THE WAY IN WHICH THE SPLIT HAS 
CERTAINLY EXPLAINED IS FIRST OF 
ALL TSVANGIRAI HAD BECOME 
BUECRATIC IN HIS STYLE OF 
LEADERSHIP A SECOND CRITICISM THAT 
IS MADE OF HIM IS THAT HE WAS 
DECISIVE AND WHAT IS KNOWN OR AT 
LEAST IS PUBLIC ABOUT THAT SPLIT IS 
THAT HE OVERRULED DEMOCRATIC VOTE 
WITHIN THE PARTY 
BUT ON THE 
POSITIVE SAID MR. TSVANGIRAI HAS 
KEPT FIGHTING DESPITE HARASSMENT 
AND ASSAULT LAST YEAR HE SUFFERED 
A FRACTURED SKULL BRAIN INJURY AND 
INTERNAL BLEEDING FOR DARING TO 
HOLD A RALLY 
HE SURVIVED LEE 
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS SO THEY'VE 
BEEN WILLING TO DO EVERYTHING AND 
ANYTHING TO ELIMINATE HIM IN 
OPPOSITION PERHAPS IT IS A MEASURE 
OF HIS CHARACTER THE RULING PARTY 
HAS DONE SO MUCH TO TRY AND 
REELIMINATE HIM AND THEY TAKE HIM 
SO SERIOUSLY HE IS SERIOUS 
OPPOSITION AND SHAS HAKEN THE 
RULING PARTY 
TSVANGIRAI MUST FEEL 
THAT VICTORY IS WITHIN HIS GRASP 
BUT HE MUST FEAR IF THERE'S A 
SECOND ROUND AND MUGABE IS 
DESPERATE TO CLING TO POWER THIS 
SO FAR PEACEFUL ELECTION COULD TURN 
VIOLENT HE KNOWS WHAT MUGABE CAN 
DO WE CAN SPEAK TO JOHN SIMPSON 
WHO IS SOMEWHERE IN ZIMBABWE WE 
CAN'T SAY EXACTLY WHERE WHAT'S THE 
SENSE THERE IS IT IT IS THE END OF 
THE MUGABE EAR I DON'TA OR THE 
BEGINNING OF THE FIGHT FOR HIS 
POLITICAL LIFE 
IT REALLY DEPENDS 
ON THE INDIVIDUAL CHOICE L. SPOKE 
THIS MORNING TO A PRETTY SENIOR 
FIGURE IN ZANU P. F. A MAN THAT I 
HAVE TALKED TO IN THE PAST I HAVE 
COME TO TRUST VERY MUCH HE SAID TO 
ME HE IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE ZANU 
P. F. FACTION THAT SUPPORTS MUGABE 
BUT HE IS STILL WITHIN THE PARTY 
AND CLOSE TO MUGABE HE SEES HIM 
REGULARLY HE SAID TO ME MUGABE'S 
FINISHED DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM 
HE'S DEAD MEAT THERE WILL BE A 
RUNNOFF HE WILL BE DEFEATED WE 
WON'T DARE DO ANYTHING THE POLICE 
ARMY AND THE SECRET POLICE WILL 
KEEP REALLY QUIET BECAUSE THEY 
WILL BE THINKING THEIR JOBS MAY BE 
ON THE LINE IF THE OPPOSITION GET 
IN AND SO EVERYBODY WILL BE ACTING 
WITH COMPLETE RESTRAINT AND CARE 
THEN I WENT AROUND TO SPEAK TO 
ANOTHER MAN THAT I'VE COME TO TRUST 
OVER THE MONTHS QUITE A WELL KNOWN 
POLITICAL ANALYST HERE AT THE 
UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE HE SAID 
WELL IF IT IS A TWENTY ONE DAY PERIOD 
BETWEEN NOW AND THE RUNNOFF 
ELECTION WHO SAYS THAT WON'T 
EXTEND ITSELF TO MAYBE THREE MONTHS 
AND MAYBE MUGABE CAN PERSUADE 
PEOPLE TO GET IT EXTENDED AND THEN 
IN THE MEANTIME CAN HE GET IN THOSE 
FAMOUS INFAMOUS WAR VETERANS SO 
CALLED AND THEY CAN FRIGHTEN 
EVERYBODY INTO VOTING FOR HIM AND 
SO HE'S NOT GONE AT ALL HE IS 
AROUND YOU CAN TAKE YOUR PICK OF 
THOSE TWO AND PLENTY OF OTHER 
VIEWS 
THANK YOU WELL CHIZYAUSIKU VIEWS SKHI THE ZIMBABWEAN AMBASSADOR IN 
THE UN IT DOES LOOK AS IF THE 
MUGABE ERA IS OVER 
DON'T WRITE HIM 
OFF 
WELL DO YOU THINK HE WILL OFF FIGHT A SECOND ROUND 
WELL THAT'S 
WHAT IS A PROVISION IN OUR 
CONSTITUTION THAT IF ONE MEMBER 
FAILS TO GET FIFTY PER CENT PLUS ONE THERE 
IS A NEED FOR A RUN YOVER 
RUNNOFF IF THAT COMES UP HE 
WILL TAKE 
THE CHALLENGE DESPITE DESPITE THE FACT HE NO LONGER HAS CONTROL 
OF PARLIAMENT 
THAT'S NEITHER HERE 
OR THERE THE CONTROL OF PARLIAMENT 
I THINK THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION HERE 
YOU HAVE BEEN COMBINING THE SUITS 
WORN BY M. D. C. TSVANGIRAI AND OTHERS 
THAT BROKE AWAY FROM TSVANGIRAI 
THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION THAT CANNOT 
BE SUBSTANCATED 
WHAT WAS IT THAT 
TURNED THE PEOPLE OF YOUR COUNTRY 
SO STRONGLY AGAINST ROBERT MUGABE 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ZIMBABWE'S 
HAPPENED IN NICK ARE A WHEN REAGAN 
AND INITIALLY THE CONTRAST INTO 
ANYTHING WITH A ANYTHING WAG ARE 
A 
THIS IS THE RESULT OF THAT ASSAULT 
ON OUR ECONOMY 
SO YOU THINK MR. 
MUGABE IS THE VICTIM OF IMPERIALIST 
SUPPRESSION DO YOU 
THAT IS 
CORRECT YOU HAVE SAID IT 
ARE YOU 
SERIOUS ARE YOU HEARING ME 
AMBASSADOR YOU ARE SERIOUSLY 
SAYING HE IS THE VICTIM OF 
EXTERNAL AGENCIES BRINGING PRESSURE 
TO BEAR ON THE ECONOMY OF ZIMBABWE 
EXACTLY THE ECONOMY OF ZIMBABWE 
SINCE TWO THOUSAND HAS NOT HAD ANY BALANCE 
OF PREMIUM SUPPORT FROM ANY QUARTER 
WE HAVE HAD TO DO IT ON OUR OWN 
AND THE VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES WE'VE 
HAD IN BALANCE PAYMENT SUPPORT FROM 
THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS HAS HAD VERY 
NEGATIVE EFFECT SURELY WE WOULD 
NOT SURVIVE WITHOUT THAT ASSISTANCE 
AS A RESULT THIS PROGRAMME OF TWO THOUSAND 
IF YOU READ ANY WIRE OR STORY 
COMING FROM ZIMBABWE EVERY 
JOURNALIST AT THE END OF THE STORY 
THEY MAKE A REFERENCES TO THE LEND 
REFORM PROGRAMME 
HE HASN'T 
WHATEVER THE CAUSABILITY HE HAS 
NOT GOT THE RESOUNDING MAJORITY 
THAT HE NOT ONLY THOUGHT HE WOULD 
GET BUT HE TOLD US IN TERMS HE 
WOULD GET ISN'T THE ONLY THING FOR 
HIM TO DO NO JUST TO GO 
TO GO 
WHERE I MEAN HE HAS UNFINISHED 
BUSINESS THE FACT THAT THE PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN DUPED THEY HAVE SUFFERED 
BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP 
THAT HAS BEEN IMPOSED ON US SURELY 
HE HAS TO IF THERE'S A CHANCE FOR 
HIM TO REDEEM THAT AND CORRECT THAT 
SITUATION HE HAS A RIGHT TO DO 
THAT 
THERE ANY OTHER COUNTRY THAT THAT WILL GIVE HIM REFUGE IF HE 
DECIDED TO LEAVE ZIMBABWE DO YOU 
THINK 
HE IS NOT GOING ANYWRFPLT HE THINK WAS BORN AND BRED IN ZIMBABWE HE 
WAS IMPRISONED IN ZIMBABWE AND HE 
HAS NO INTENTIONS OF EVER LEAVING 
THAT COUNTRY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOR A FULL LIST OF BLOGS CHECK OUT 
THE NEWSNIGHT WEBSITE ONE OF THE 
ARCHITECTS OF THE PEACE SETTLEMENT 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND SUDDENLY 
ANNOUNCED TODAY HE IS QUITTING HIS 
JOB THE IRISH PRIME MINISTER 
BERTIE AHERN HAS HAD TO RESIGN HIS 
POST IN THE FACE OF DEEPENING 
SCANDAL IT IS NOT THE FIRST 
CORRUPTION CASE AND DOUBTLESS IT 
WON'T BE THE LAST BUT MR. AHERN'S 
PASSING WAS MOURNED WIDELY 
WITH HIS POLITICAL STAFF FADING 
FAST THE TEFLON TAOISEACH COULD 
HANG ON NO MORE DOGGED BY 
FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES HE SAID 
HE WOULD STEP DOWN NEXT MONTH BUT 
INSISTED HE HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG 
I WANT EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND 
NEVER IN ALL THE TIME I SERVED IN 
PUBLIC LIFE HAVE I EVER PUT MY 
PERSONAL INTERESTS AHEAD OF THE 
PUBLIC GOOD 
IT IS HIS PERSONAL 
FINANCIALS WHICH ARE UNDER INTENSE 
SCRUTINY OF THE LONG RUNNING MAHON 
TRIBUNAL INTO CORRUPTION WHILE MR. 
AHERN SAID SOME ASPECTS WERE 
UNUSUAL THEY WERE NOT HE SAID 
DISHONEST 
WHILE I WILL BE THE DISHONEST FIRST TO ADMIT I'VE MADE MISTAKES 
IN MY LIFE AND MY CAREER ONE 
MISTAKE I'VE NEVER MADE WAS TO 
ENRICH MYSELF BY MISUSING THE TRUST 
OF THE PEOPLE I'VE NEVER RECEIVED 
A CORRUPT PAYMENT AND I'VE NEVER 
DONE ANYTHING TO DISHONOUR ANY 
OFFICE THAT I'VE EVER HELD 
STAYING ON WAS NO LONGER AN OPTION 
A FORMER LORD MAYOR OF DUBLIN 
BERTIE AHERN BECAME LEADER OF 
FIANNA FAIL IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THREE YEARS 
LATER HE BECAME THE TAOISEACH HE 
WENT ON TO WIN TWO MORE ELECTIONS 
TO BECOME THE SECOND LONGEST 
RUNNING TAOISEACH IN IRELAND 
HE BROUGHT STABILITY TO A COUNTRY 
THAT HAD SEEN THREE GENERAL 
ELECTION SAYING EIGHTEEN MONTHS HE 
OVERSAW THE EMERGENCE OF THE CELTIC 
TIGER ECONOMY THE COUNTRY STILL 
ENJOYS PROSPERITY ACROSS THE WORLD 
HE WILL BE REMEMBERED AS ONE OF THE 
CHIEF ARCHITECTS OF THE GOOD FRIDAY 
AGREEMENT 
I THINK BERTIE AHERN'S AGREEMENT PERSONALITY AND POLITICAL SKILLS 
NEGOTIATING SKILLS PARTICULARLY IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH TONY BLAIR THE 
TWO OF THEM OFTEN WORKING TOGETHER 
WAS ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL TO THE 
SUCCESS WITHIN THAT HIS PATIENTS 
HIS RESILIENCE HIS ABILITY TO 
WITHSTAND PRESSURE AND ABUSE HIS 
PATIENTS SOMETIMES FROM WITHIN THE 
TALKS BECAUSE HE SAW THE NEED TO 
GET THROUGH THE NEXT DAY AND THE 
NEXT DAY EVENTUALLY WE ARE GOING 
TO GET THERE THAT WAS HIS APPROACH 
BUT FOR OTHERS THE PARALLELS WITH 
TONY BLAIR DID NOT END WITH THE 
SIGNING OF THE GOOD FRIDAY 
AGREEMENT 
FOR TONY BLAIR IRAQ AGREEMENT BROUGHT HIM DOWN DIMINISHED HIM 
FOR BERTIE AHERN IT HAS BEEN HIS 
PAST FINANCIAL DEALINGS IN BOTH 
THEIR CASES THEY WILL HOPE THAT 
NORTHERN IRELAND ACHIEVING AN 
IMPERFECT BUT PRETTY SOLID PEACE IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND WILL BE WAY UP 
THERE IN THEIR RECORD CARDS THAT 
IS WHAT THEY WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR 
AND THE REST WILL GRADUALLY BE 
FORGOTTEN 
TRIBUTES FROM OTHER FORGOTTEN LEADERS FOR HIS WORK IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND AT HOME HAVE CONTINUED 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT THE 
FINANCIAL ALLEGATIONS WHICH HAVE 
ENDED HIS CAREER AS TAOISEACH ARE 
NOT YET READY TO GO AWAY THE 
TRIBUNAL CONTINUES 
NOW YOU MAY BE PLEASED TO HEAR 
THAT IN PREPARATION FOR THIS 
PROGRAMME I FORMED A LETTER C. LIKE 
THIS WITH MY THUMB AND FOREFINGER 
AND ROBBED EITHER SIDE OF MY 
BREASTBONE WHILE MY OTHER HAND WAS 
ON MY ENABLE THIS IS A GUARANTEED 
WAY TO STIMULATE THE BRAIN ON MY 
NAVEL YOUR TAXES MAY BE BEING 
SPENT ON PRECISELY THAT KIND OF 
STUFF THAT IS A GENERAL GENUINE 
EXERCISE IN SOMETHING THAT IS 
CALLED BRAIN GYM IN PRIMARY 
SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT A LAND AND 
ENDORSED BY THE EDUCATION 
DEPARTMENT TOMORROW A CAMPAIGN 
GROUP WILL LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN 
AGAINST THE PRACTICE 
PLEASE COULD YOU STAND IN A SPACE 
WITH YOUR FEET PLANTED FIRMLY ON 
THE GROUND 
IF YOU WANT TO BOOST 
YOUR BRAIN POWER TRY THIS A 
SERIES OF MOVEMENTS THAT ARE 
SUPPOSED TO BE A WORKOUT FOR THE 
MIND WELCOME TO THE BRAIN GYM A 
THE CHILDREN AT ACRESFIELD PRIMARY 
SCHOOL START THEIR DAY WITH A 
LITTLE LIGHT EXERCISE INVENTED IN 
CALIFORNIA THE BRAIN GYM TECHNIQUE 
CLAIMS TO ENHANCE MENTAL 
PERFORMANCE 
PLEASE CAN WE DO MY PERFORMANCE FAVOURITE NOW 
THE HEAD TEACHER 
SUE SMITH IS A BRAIN GYM BELIEVER 
SHE USES IT THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL 
DAY SHE HAS FOUND IT COMES DOWN 
THE PUPILS AND BELIEVES IT MAKES 
THEIR MINDS MORE RECEPTIVE TO THE 
LESSONS AHEAD CALMS DOWN 
I HAVE 
BEEN TEACHING FOR THIRTY SEVEN YEARS L. HAVE 
ALWAYS FELT L. AM SO PLEASED THAT 
BRAIN GYM HAS COME INTO MY LIFE NOW 
AT THIS TIME EQUALLY IF I HAD HAD 
IT THIRTY SEVEN YEARS AGO IT WOULD HAVE MADE 
A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE THEN WE 
HAVE A CALM JOYFUL SCHOOL WE HAVE 
AN INCLUSIVE SCHOOL L. WANT TO 
TEACH YOU AN EXERCISE CALLED LAZY 
BEATS 
SHE HAS EMPLOYED LOUISE COOK BEATS A QUALIFIED BRAIN GYM INSTRUCTOR 
AS A CONSULTANT IT IS HER JOB TO 
TEACH THE TEACHERS 
THEY NOTICE THE 
HAND WRITING IS FASTER 
IT IS 
INTERESTING YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE 
WHEN MRS. SMITH DID SOME OF THE LAZY 
ALPHABET IT WAS SOME OF THE BEST 
HANDWRITING I HAD SEEN FROM THE 
CLASS PARTICULARLY FROM THE BOYS 
IT WAS MUCH IMPROVED L. FOUND IT 
MADE A DIFFERENCE 
LOUISE BELIEVES 
THAT LEARNING DIFFICULTIES COULD BE 
RELATED TO STRESS IN THE BODY'S 
POSTURE SHE USES MOVEMENT TO EASE 
THE STRESSES AND THAT SHE SAYS 
UNLOCKED THE LEARNING PROBLEMS 
THERE IS AN EXERCISE WE DO WHEN YOU 
RUB THE CHEEK MUSCLES RELAX THE 
TENSION IN THE JAW IF WE RELEASE 
THE TENSION IN THE JAW WE ARE 
RELEASING PROBLEMS IN THE JOINT 
UNDERNEATH THIS JOINT FIVE OF THE 
CRANIAL NERVES COME OUT AND THEY 
FEED INTO THE FACE THEY ALSO FEED 
INTO THE SHOULDERS AND HIPS TO 
IMPROVE BALANCE 
REALLY HIGH 
STRETCHES 
THE TEACHERS FIND BRAIN STRETCHES GYM PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR HELPING 
CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL 
NEEDS SUCH AS SAM 
HE HAS GOT 
QUITE A FEW DIFFICULTIES PHYSICAL 
AND LEARNING DIFFICULTIES SINCE HE 
HAS BEEN AT SCHOOL THEY DO IT 
EVERY MORNING IT HAS HELPED HIM TO 
FOCUS DURING LESSONS TO REMAIN 
CALM IT HAS HELPED HIM WITH HIS 
SPATIAL AWARENESS HIS READING AND 
WRITING NUMEROUS ASPECTS OF HIS 
DEVELOPMENT 
WHAT HAS HE HAD TO SAY DEVELOPMENT ABOUT BRAIN GYM 
HE LOVES IT HE 
DOES IT EVERY MORNING 
SO HOW DOES 
IT ALL WORK WELL ACCORDING TO THE 
TEACHER'S MANUAL THE SUGGESTED 
MOVEMENTS CAN HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT 
ON THE BRAIN THE EXERCISES IT 
SAYS CAN REWIRE THE NEURAL 
PATHWAYS INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TO 
THE FRONTAL LOBES AND EVEN CLEAR 
BLOCKAGES AND ALL OF THIS 
SUPPOSEDLY CAN MAKE THE CHILDREN 
USE THEIR BRAIN TO THEIR FULL 
POTENTIAL THE BRAIN GYM MANUAL 
CONTAINS TWENTY SIX EXERCISES THAT ARE 
MEANT TO REALIGN THE MIND AND BODY 
HERE ARE SOME OF THEM PRESSING THE 
BRAIN BUTTONS THESE ARE LOCATED IN 
SOFT TISSUE UNDER THE CLAVICLE TO 
THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF THE STERNUM 
ACCORDING TO THE MANUAL PRESSING 
THEM ACTIVATES THE BRAIN FOR 
SENDING MESSAGES FROM THE RIGHT 
BRAIN HEMISPHERE TO THE LEFT AND 
AN INCREASED FLOW OF 
ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY IT IS USED 
TO HELP READING THE ENERGY YOURN 
INCREASES CIRCULATION TO THE BRAIN 
FOR INCREASED SENSORY PERCEPTION 
IT HELPS THAT READING ALOUD AND 
CREATIVE WRITING HOOKUPS CONNECT 
THE BODY FOR EMOTIONAL CENTRE AND 
IN THE BRAIN THEY SAY IT HELPS 
STUDENTS TAKE TESTS AND WORK AT A 
KEYBOARD 
YES BRAIN GYM RELIES A KEYBOARD LOT ON MY SARGE IN VARIOUS POINTS 
IN THE BODY MASSAGE YOU HAVE TO 
PRESS AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE 
UNDERNEATH THE CLAVICLE WHILE 
RUBBING YOUR NAVEL THIS IS 
SUPPOSED TO CHANGE BLOOD FLOWED 
INTO THE BRAIN AND THEREFORE 
IMPROVED INTEGRATION A BIT LIKE 
TRYING TO REGULATE YOUR CENTRAL 
HEATING SYSTEM BY PRESSING ON THE 
WALL OF YOUR HOUSE BECAUSE THE 
TIDES ARE BEHIND THERE THE NOTION 
THAT PRESSURE HERE WILL ALTER MY 
BRAIN IS SO IMPLAUSIBLE AND BEYOND 
THAT THE VIEW THAT SOMEHOW 
CHANGING OVERALL BLOOD FLOW WILL 
ALTER PARTICULAR DISTRIBUTION 
ACTIVITIES IN THE BRAIN AND 
THEREFORE IMPROVE LEARNING IT'S 
JUST NONSENSE 
BRAIN GYM IS A 
COMMERCIAL TRADEMARK PROGRAMME 
MANY LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES 
PAID TO TRAIN THEIR TEACHERS AND 
FOR INSTRUCTORS THERE ARE NOW MORE 
THAN SEVENTY SUCH INSTRUCTORS IN THE U. K. 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT HAS NO IDEA 
HOW MANY SCHOOLS USE THE SYSTEM IT 
IS THOUGHT TO BE THOUSANDS IT HAS 
NOT ASSESSED HOW EFFECTIVE THE 
SYSTEM MIGHT BE BUT PAUL HOWARD 
JONES HAS HE THINKS BRAIN GYM DOES 
NOT DO WHAT IT IS SAID TO DO I I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT 
BRAIN GYM DOES WHAT IT SAYS ON THE 
TIN IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT 
IMPROVES THE TENSION THERE IS SOME 
EVIDENCE THAT IT IMPROVES RESPONSE 
TIMES IMPROVES ATTENTION IN 
TERMS OF BALANCING THE BRAIN 
HEMISPHERES THERE'S NO CONVINCING 
SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AT ALL IN 
TERMS OF IMPROVING SCHOOL 
PERFORMANCE THERE IS NO CONVINCING 
EVIDENCE AGAIN 
THE SCIENCE MIGHT 
SEEM A LITTLE ORDER MOST OF THE 
CLAIMS ARE UNTESTED A LITTLE 
AWED SOME OF THEM ARE SIMPLY WRONG 
WHAT IS WRONG WITH USING IT IN 
SCHOOLS IF IT HELPS THE CHILDREN 
THIS LADY IS ONE OF THE LEADING 
ADVOCATES OF BRAIN GYM IN THE U. K. 
SHE ACKNOWLEDGES THE EXPLANATIONS 
OF HOW BRAIN GYM WORKS ARE PSEUDO 
SCIENTIFIC BUT THE AMERICAN 
CREATORS SAY THAT THE STATEMENTS IN 
THE TEACHER'S MANUAL HAVE 
SCIENTIFIC MERIT HENCEFORTH THEY 
WILL BE STATED AS HYPOTHESES RATHER 
THAN SCIENTIFIC FACT 
I FEEL THAT 
THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE THAT BRAIN 
GYM ACTUALLY GIVES SIGNIFICANT 
IMPACT IMPROVEMENT IN READING OF 
AROUND TWO TO THREE MONTHS OF IMPROVEMENT 
PER MONTH OF INTERVENTION FOR POOR 
READERS EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS THERE IS 
ENOUGH NEED FOR HELP WITH READING 
IN SCHOOLS THAT IT IS WORTH USING 
THE BRAIN GYM PROGRAMME BY BY DRESSING UP WHAT MIGHT BE ACTUALLY 
VERY USEFUL CLASSROOM EXERCISES 
WITH THIS DOGMA ALMOST CULT LIKE 
PSEUDO SCIENCE IT IS A GREAT PITY 
THE RESIDUAL MISPERCEPTIONS THAT IT 
WILL LEAVE YOUNG CHILDREN AND 
TEACHERS WITH IS PERHAPS MUCH MORE 
DAMAGING THAN THE CONSEQUENCES OF 
THE EXERCISES THEMSELVES CHILDREN CHILDREN THANK YOU FOR OFFERING TO GIVE YOUR 
IMPRESSIONS OF HOW YOU FEEL BRAIN 
GYM HELPS YOU 
BRAIN GYM GETS THE 
BLOOD PUMPING INTO YOUR BRAIN YOU YOU SING SO 
YES YOU THINK SO L. I LIKE ENERGY YAWNS BECAUSE IT GETS 
YOUR LEFT BRAIN AND YOU'RE RIGHT 
BRAIN CONNECTED AND IT HELPS YOU 
LEARN 
YOU BELIEVE THAT 
SAY YOU'RE LEARN DOING TEST ANY KIND OF TEST DO 
A LITTLE BIT OF BRAIN GYM SAY YOU 
ARE STUCK ON MATHS TEST YOU DO A 
BIT OF THE ENERGY YAWN AND YOU FIND 
THE ANSWER JUST LIKE THAT DESPITE DESPITE ATTEMPTS BY BRITISH BRAIN GYM 
ENTHUSIASTS TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES 
FROM AMERICAN AND SCIENTIFIC 
EXPLANATIONS AMERICAN 
UNSCIENTIFIC EXPLANATIONS THERE IS 
EVIDENCE THAT BRAIN GYM IS 
PERMEATING THE BRITISH SCHOOL 
SYSTEM 
IT IS TIME TO GO IN FOR SYSTEM LEARNING AGAIN PUT YOUR HANDS BY 
YOUR SIDE 
A GROWING NUMBER OF 
SCIENTISTS AND EDUCATION EXPERTS 
BELIEVE THAT UNTIL THE SYSTEM'S 
CLAIMS CAN BE BACKED BY PEER 
REVIEWED RESEARCH THE IDEAS BEHIND 
BRAIN GYM HAVE NO PLACE IN OUR 
SCHOOLS SCHOOLS JOINING THE FROM LOS ANGELES DOCTOR 
PAUL DENNISON THE BRAINS BEHIND 
BRAIN GYM 
I CAN'T HEAR YOU I CAN'T HEAR YOU 
AT ALL NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST 
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY WE CAN'T HEAR 
YOU WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET BACK 
TO YOU WE HAVE A TECHNICAL PROBLEM 
IN THE MEANTIME I WILL TELL 
WHAT'S COMING UP HAVE YOU HEARD 
ABOUT THE ONE ABOUT ABOUT THE 
JEWISH MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN 
IMMEDIATANCE WHEN IS IT ACCEPTABLE 
TO POKE FUN AT RELIGION BEFORE 
THAT A ROUNDUP THE PARTY OF 
ROBERT MUGABE HAS LOST CONTROL OF 
ZIMBABWE'S PARLIAMENT FORCE THE 
FIRST TIME SINCE THE COUNTRY GAINED 
INDEPENDENCE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THE RESULT 
OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HELD

GOES TO A CABINET MEETING SHE WEARS 
CLOTHES AS A CLOWN 
I WOULD START 
BY SAYING IF I'M LOOKING FOR 
ADVICE ON WHAT TO WEAR OR WHAT NOT 
TO WEAR I THINK THE VERY LAST 
PERSON I WOULD LOOK TO ADVICE IN 
THE MAN IN THE BASEBALL CAP 
PERSON I WOULD LOOK TO ADVICE IN THE MAN IN THE BASEBALL CAP 
AND 
AND THE MARKETS IN THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED INDEX 
IS UP LET'S SEE IF WE CAN TALK TO 
BRAINS BEHIND BRAIN GYM I'M SORRY 
WE COULDN'T HEAR YOU A MOMENT AGO 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT A BRAIN BUTTON 
IS PLEASE RAISE 
WE HAVE ON OUR 
BODIES CERTAIN REFLEX POINTS THAT 
HELP US ORGANISE THE BODY AND THE 
BRAIN 
BRAIN WE'RE HOLDING THESE POINTS 
HELP TO ACTIVATE DEVELOPMENTAL 
MOVEMENTS THAT THEY ARE CALLED 
MICRO INTERVENTIONS TO HELP IMPROVE 
THE CONNECTIONS 
AND CIRCUMSTANCE TRI AND APPARENT 
RESULTS ARE PEOPLE GET A BETTER 
SENSE OF WHERE THEY ARE IN SPACE 
SENSE OF LEFT AND RIGHT AND ABLE 
TO MOVE BETTER BUT WE'LL LEAVE THE 
EXPLANATIONS TO THE EXPERTS WE'VE 
BEEN EXPLAINING THESE THE BEST WE 
CAN OVER THE YEARS AND WE'RE OPEN 
TO INQUIRY AND DEVELOP THE BEST 
EXPLANATIONS FOR THEM BUT THE FACT 
THEY DO INDEED WORK 
WELL YES YOU 
SAY IN YOUR TEACHER'S MANUAL HERE 
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HOOKUPS THAT 
THEY CONNECT THE ELECTRICAL 
CIRCUITS IN THE BODY WHAT EXACTLY 
ARE THE ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS 
PLEASE 
WELL IT IS MY OPINION PLEASE THAT WE ARE ELECTRICAL THAT WE DO 
HAVE CIRCUITS AND CONNECTIONS AND 
WHEN WE BRING OUR ENERGY TO THE 
MID LINE TO THE CENTRAL POINT WE 
ARE BREAKING OUT OF THE RE FLEX TO 
GO FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER AND 
BRING THINGS BACK TO THE CENTRE 
WHERE WE CAN BE CALM AND RELAXED 
AND FOCUSED 
YOU SAY IT IS YOUR OPINION THAT WE 
ARE ELECTRICAL ARE YOU MEDICALLY 
QUALIFIED 
NO I'M NOT MEDICALLY QUALIFIED QUALIFIED I'M AN EDUCATOR BUT I 
STUDY AND READ AND THERE ARE 
STUDIES TO IT SHOW THAT WE HAVE 
ELECTRICAL ACUPUNCTURE AND OTHER 
PROCEDURES ARE BASED ON THE FACT 
THERE ARE ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS TO 
THE BODY WE ARE BUILDING ON THE 
SHOULDERS OF THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
BEEN DOING IT FOR THOUSANDS OF 
YEARS THE FACT YOU ARE NOT YEARS IS THE FACT YOU ARE NOT MEDICALLY QUALIFIED EXPLANATION 
ENOUGH FOR STATEMENTS IN THIS 
TEACHER'S MANUAL OF THE KIND THAT 
PROGRESSED FOODS DO NOT CONTAIN 
WATER WHICH YOU KNOW IS APPARENT 
NONSENSE 
WE'RE INTERESTED IN NONSENSE HELPING CHILDREN AND THESE THINGS 
WORK AND WE EXPLAINED THEM THE 
BEST WE CAN AND WE ARE GOING TO 
EDIT THE MANUAL AND REWRITE IT BUT BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT IS 
ABSOLUTELY BUT YOU APPRECIATE THAT 
IS NOT 
THE BEST OF MY ABILITY TO 
HELP CHILDREN AND TO HELP TEACHERS 
HAVE A CONDEX FOR WHY THEY ARE 
DOING THE MOVEMENTS 
IF YOUR MANUAL 
CAN CONTAIN IDIOTIC STATEMENTS LIKE 
THAT IS THERE ANY REASON TO 
BELIEVE ANYTHING ELSE IN IT 
I DO 
BELIEVE THOSE STATEMENTS ARE TRUE 
AND TIME WILL PROVE THAT THEY ARE 
YOU BELIEVE PROGRESSED FOODS DON'T 
CONTAIN WATER DO YOU 
I HAD A 
CONTEXT FOR THAT STATEMENT MEANING 
THAT PURE WATER IS MORE IMMEDIATELY 
ACTIVE AND AVAILABLE TO THE BRAIN 
AND THAT I'M NOT ATTACHED TO EITHER 
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT 
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT 
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO 
BECAUSE WHAT YOU DID 
SAY IS NONSENSE 
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THAT 
WAS THE BEST INFORMATION I HAD AND 
NO ONE HAS COMPLAINED ABOUT THE 
TEACHER'S EDITION UNTIL THIS POINT 
LET ME ASK YOU SORRY TO CUT ACROSS 
YOU THERE'S A DELAY ON THE 
SATELLITE LET ME ASK YOU THIS HOW 
MANY SCHOOLS IN BRITAIN ARE USING 
THIS PROGRAMME OF YOURS 
THE BRAINS 
PROGRAMME IS EMBRACED AND LOVED IN 
EIGHTY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD L. 
HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY SCHOOLS USE 
IT IT BUT CHILDREN LOVE IT BECAUSE THEY 
LEARN BETTER TEACH TEACHERS LOVE 
IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHILDREN WHO 
ARE LOVING AND WILLING AND ABLE TO 
LOVE SCHOOL THESE ARE TOOLS THAT I 
DEVELOPED AS A READING SPECIALIST 
OVER MY WHOLE CAREER BECAUSE I 
JUST LOVE TO SEE A CHILD COME TO 
LIFE WHEN IT LEARNS 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M SORRY 
ABOUT THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY 
EARLIER HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE 
ONE WHAT HAPPENED TO MOHAMMED AL 
FAYED WHEN HIS BEARD FELL OUT NO 
OF COURSE YOU HAVEN'T YOU CAN MAKE 
A JOKE ABOUT POPE JESUS OR 
HEAVENLY HOST ARCHBISHOP OF 
CANTERBRUY CAN'T'S DAYS ARE RUINED 
IF HE'S NOT CALLED BEARDIE WHAT 
ABOUT ISLAM PEOPLE ARE SCARED 
BECAUSE SOMEONE MAY THREATEN TO 
KILL SOMEONE IN A MOMENT WE WILL 
DEBATE WHEN GOD IS FUNNY FIRST OUR 
CULTURE CORRESPONDENT REPORTS 
WHEN IT COMES TO KAS SACKS IN THE 
PARISH OF DIBLY THE GAGS ARE 
LIMITLESS HOWEVER MEMORABLE THE 
AYATOLLAH SONG FROM NOT THE NINE 
O'CLOCK NEWS IS NOT THE SORT OF 
THING B. B. C. APPROVES OFF THE B. B. C. IS 
IN THE HAN BIT OF VETOING JOKES OF 
IMAM BEN ELTON CLAIMS IN AN 
INTERVIEW WITH THE CHRISTIAN 
CULTURE MAGAZINE HE SAID 
THESE ARE HOLY LANDS 
THREE YEARS AGO STREET PROTESTS 
FAILED TO STOP THE B. B. C. BROADCASTING 
THE AWARD WINNING SHOW JERRY 
SPRINGER THE OP RARKS WHICH 
SATIRISED ASPECTS OF CHRISTIANITY 
SINCE THEN THERE'S LEGISLATION 
AGAINST INCITING RELIGIOUS HATRED 
COMEDIANS SAID IT WOULD MIKE SATIRE 
A CRIMINAL OFFENCE 
THERE'S A NEW NERVOUSNESS AMONG THE 
COMEDY CLASS 
I'VE SEEN IT IN 
PRACTICE WITH SOME B. B. C. PEOPLE 
WHERE THERE'S MOUMS LET'S NOT TALK 
ABOUT IT IS TOO DANGEROUS AND TOO 
TRICKY IT IS PRICKLY SUBJECT SO 
I CAN AGREE WITH HIM THAT HE'S 
EXPERIENCED THIS AS A MUSLIM 
PERSON IF I HAD A TREATMENT AND 
TOOK IT TO A B. B. C. EXECUTIVE THEY 
SAID MUSLIMS I DON'T THINK THE 
COMMUNITY'S NOT READY FOR IT IT IS 
TOO DANGEROUS AND YOU KNOW THEY 
WOULD JUST SHOULDN'T IT AND THEY 
WOULDN'T USE IT 
BUT CAN YOU 
UNDERSTAND THE FEAR OF BEING 
TARGETED BY MINORITY OF EXTREMISTS 
GIVEN THE UPROAR OVER THE CARTOON 
OF THE PROPHET WITH A BOMB IN HIS 
TUR BON 
THE CARTOONS TO MY MIND WAS 
OFFENSIVE IN THE WAY THEY WERE 
PRIMITIVE AND DIB LATRY MEANT TO 
HURT SOMEONE'S FEELINGS IF MUSLIMS 
IN ON THE JOKE IT IS O. K. 
SO WHAT DOES B. B. C. COMEDY HAVE TO SAY 
ABOUT ALLEGEDLY CENSORG JOKES THEY 
SAID NO SUBJECT WAS OFF LIMITS NOR 
SHOULD ANY DEVICE CAUSE HARM IT 
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE C. L. R. FAE CASE 
BUT THEY DECLINED FOR US TO 
INTERVIEW YET THE B. B. C. HAS 
COMMISSIONED SHOWS ABOUT RISQUE 
JOKES THE COMEDIANS AREN'T WHITE 
SOME OF THEM COME OVER HERE I HAVE 
FRIENDS I CAN'T STAND I COME TO 
LONE I CAN'T TAKE T. IN MY COUNTRY 
IF I SEE TWO INCHES OF A LADY'S 
ANKLES I'M MASTURBATEING FOR TWELVE 
YEARS 
PERHAPS THEY THINK HUMOUR YEARS CAN BE WITHOUT BOUNDARIES WHEN 
THERE'S A PERCEPTION ABOUT YOUR OWN 
SORT WITH ME NOW ARE THREE 
COMEDIANS ALL OF WHOM ARE WRITTEN 
COMEDY FROM THE B. B. C. AND HAVE COME 
FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS SHAPPI 
KHORSANDI 
JAMES CARY JAMES CARY YOU DID THIS INTERVIEW 
WITH BEN ELTON HE'S BASICALLY 
RIGHT ISN'T HE 
HE WAS MAKING A 
WIDER POINT IN THE INTERVIEW ABOUT 
THE FACT THAT HIS OVERALL PROBLEM 
WAS WITH RELIGION GENERALLY 
PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY HAVE FAITH CAN 
SOMETIMES FEEL THEY ARE BEYOND 
QUESTIONING AND THAT THEY DON'T 
DESERVE TO BE CHALLENGED THEN HE 
EXPRESSED SYMPATHY WITH THE VIEW 
THAT CHRISTIANITY SEEMS TO GET IT 
IN THE NECK WHEREAS THE SITUATION 
OF MAKING REFERRING TO MOHAMMED 
COULD BE MISCONSTRUED 
AND I GUESS ONE CAN HAVE SYMPATHY 
WITH A PRODUCER WHO SAYS IT IS 
EASIER IF YOU DON'T AND SO 
THERE'S AN ELEMENT THERE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK S. N. 
I WAS RAISED 
IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITH MORE OF A 
CHRISTIAN BACKGROUND THAN ANY 
OTHER BECAUSE I WENT TO SCHOOL IN 
THE SEVEN ZEROS AND WENT TO A CHRISTIAN 
SCHOOL AFTER I LEFT IRAN 
THEY CALLED THEM SCHOOLS SO I GREW 
UP SINGING ABOUT PLOUGHING THE 
FIELDS AND SCATTERING THE GOOD AND 
THE POINT IS THAT WITH CHRISTIANITY 
THIS IS A CHRISTIAN COUNTRY SO 
WHEN I WATCH THE VICAR OF DIBLEY 
FEATURED ON YOUR BIT I KNOW WHAT A 
EUCHARIST IS AND COMMUNION IS AND 
YET WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ISLAM 
SOMEHOW THE MEDIA WHOEVER YOU 
LIKE HAS MADE PEOPLE LIKE THE 
AYATOLLAH AND HAMCY SYMBOLS OF 
ISLAM AND THEY ARE NOT THERE ARE 
FANATICS IN EVERY RELIGION WHEN WE 
SAY WE CAN'T TAKE THE MICKEY OUT OF 
ISLAM MAYBE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
THESE PEOPLE 
HAVE YOU EVER MADE A 
MUSLIM JOKE 
I'M A. R. TOO SENSITIVE 
TO DO SUCH A THING 
WHY NOT FROM FROM MY COMEDY I SPEAK FROM A POINT OF 
UNDERSTANDING WHERE I'M COMING FROM 
SO I WOULD SPEAK WITH AUTHORITY OR 
REASONABLE AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY IF 
I WAS TO DO SHOW IN FRONT OF A 
PREDOMINANTLY JEWISH AUDIENCE I 
WOULD TALK ABOUT MY BARRACK GROUND 
OR SENSE OF AUTHORITY ON THAT 
I WOULDN'T FEEL FRIGHTENED BUT I 
WOULDN'T FEEL IN SENSE IF I 
DON'T KNOW ABOUT A SUBJECT I 
WOULDN'T TEND TO GO THERE WHY WHY WOULD I IT SEEMS AT THE MOMENT 
ISLAM IS THE ONE THING YOU COULD BE 
TOTALLY IGNORANT ABOUT NOT HAVE 
READ ANYTHING ABOUT AND YET TALK 
LIKE YOU'RE AN EXPERT THE MAJORITY 
OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO OUT AN 
LIMB AND DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT 
ISLAM THE WAY THEY KNOW ABOUT 
CHRISTIANITY IN ORDER TO SEND IT 
UP YOO WOULD MARK DO A JOKE ABOUT 
ISLAM 
IT IS CHRISTIANITY'S MISTORE ISLAM FOUND TOO SO MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT 
IT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO JOKE ABOUT 
IT 
THIS DEBATE IS NOT GOING ON A IT LEVEL PLAYING FIELD RIGHT NOW IT 
IS NOT YOU MIGHT DISAGREE WITH ME 
BUT IT IS NOT ORDINARY CHRISTIAN 
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW 
THAT ARE FEELING REALLY VULNERABLE 
TO HATRED 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER 
THAT'S TRUE THERE IS A SENSE 
WITHIN AN GEL K. A. L. CHRISTIANITY 
THAT CHRISTIANS GET A HARDER TIME 
ON TELEVISION AND THEY ARE FAIR 
GAME 
THEY ARE GET TEASED A WHOLE GAME LOT MORE 
AFFECTIONATELY SO 
DOESN'T IT COME BACK TO THE FACT 
COMMON KNOWLEDGE THE MORE PEOPLE 
KNOW ABOUT A SUBJECT THE MORE IT 
IS IF IT IS NOT ELITIST BUT A LOT 
OF SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW 
ABOUT THE COMMON INTEREST THERE 
WON'T BE THE COMMON RESPONSE OF 
COMMUNIC INPUT F. HIS TALKING ABOUT 
A SPECIFIC THING IT WON'T HAVE THE 
SAME COMEDY VALUE IT IS IMPORTANT 
TO SEE IF A PERSON IS TARGET 
THE COMEDY IS CRUEL FOR THE SAKE 
OF BEING CRUEL THAT'S DIFFERENT TO 
SOMETHING THAT'S ALL INCLUSIVE YOU YOU DID ADVERTISE YOURSELVES THAT THE 
RELIGION IS THE ONE THAT TURNS THE 
OTHER CHEEK 
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO SEND IN 
THE SALVATION ARMY 
I AGREE AND IN 
A SENSE CHRISTIANITY IS A ORIGIN 
OF GRACE SO CHRISTIANS HAVE TO 
SUCK IT UP AND GET ON WITH IT ALL ALL THE GREAT FAITHS ARE THOUGH 
IN A 
SENSE TOLERANCE OF ALTERNATIVES 
POINTS OF VIEW SHOULD BE A 
CHRISTIAN VALUE WHICH IS MORE 
PREVALENT AND OFTEN IT IS 
CHRISTIANS WHO SEEM TO HAVE THE 
GREAT 
AND JEW DAYISM 
IF WE CAN GREAT RETURN TO THE IDEA OF WHAT COMEDY 
IS TRYING TO DO IT IS PARTLY 
DEPENDS ON WHO YOUR AUDIENCE IS 
THE B. B. C. HAS BEEN MINDFUL OF THE 
FACT IT IS A GLOBAL ORGANISATION 
IF IT WANTS TO MAKE THROW AWAY 
JOKE OF A MUSLIM PRIEST IT WILL 
HAVE ITCH CASES 
B. B. C. PUTS ON JERRY 
SPRINGER THE OPERA AND DOESN'T 
APOLOGISE FOR IT WITH COMPLAINTS 
JIEFPLT THERE'S A CONTEXT WITHIN 
THAT BUT IN BRITAIN AT LEAST 
CHRISTIANITY HAS BEEN THE DOMINANT 
RELIGION OF THE LAST ONE THOUSAND YEARS 
AND THEREFORE IN A SENSE ANYTHING 
THAT IS SEEN TO BE ATTACKING A 
FAITH OF A MINORITY WILL COULD BE 
CONSTRUED AS UNHELPFUL AND 
PREJUDICE PREJUDICE I WILL BE MORE INTERESTED 
THEREFORE TO SEE HOW THAT DEBATE 
COULD MOVE ON 
WOULDN'T IT BE A 
WHOLE LOT FRANKER IF NOT DIGNIFIED 
TO SAY THE REASON PEOPLE DON'T MAKE 
JOKES ABOUT ISLAM IS BECAUSE 
THEY'RE SCARED OF ISLAMIC HARD 
NUTS 
I WOULD SAY IT IS BECAUSE NUTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SEND UP 
BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE JOKES 
ABOUT ISLAM REALLY AND TRULY A 
LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE NUTS 
DON'T THOUGH ABOUT THE NUTS AND 
ISLAM BUT WHAT A CRIMINAL MORE 
RISK TERRORIST ACT THAT PEOPLE KNOW 
ABOUT ISLAM SO THEY CAN TAKE THE 
MICKEY OUT OF THAT BUT THE NUTS 
AND BOTTLES OF THE CUSTOMS AND CULT 
TIERL SIDE OF THE RELIGION 
COMEDIANS CAN'T SEND UP BECAUSE 
THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE THE STEREOTYPES ARE LIMIT SO WHERE DO 
YOU SORT OF TARGET YOUR COMEDY AND 
THERE A LOT OF JEWISH STEREOTYPES 
AND FOR A JEWISH PERFORMER I MAY 
TAP INTO THORKS BUT THERE'S A 
COMMON AREA WITH THE COMEDY THAN 
SPECIFIC TARGETS 
DO YOU FEEL 
UNFORTUNATELY IF CHRISTIANS MAKE 
JOKES ABOUT JEWS 
IT DEPENDS ON THE 
TARGET THE PARTICULAR SUBJECT IF 
IT IS CRUEL AND NASTY AND 
VINDICTIVE YES I WOULD IF IT IS 
I CAN'T THINK 
BUT THAT DOES 
HAPPEN AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITH 
ISLAM SO MUCH S. N. NO 
YOU SHOULD 
GO TO THE COMEDY CLUBS I PERFORM IN 
THERE'S A LOT MORE OF A TARGET THAT 
PEOPLE THINK IT MIGHT NOT GET ON 
RADIO AND TELEVISION 
WHY ISN'T IT 
GETTING ON TELEVISION 
IT IS ABOUT 
CONTACTS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN BEING A INDIVIDUAL AND 
BEING A NATIONAL BROADCASTER WITH 
A RESPONSIBILITY AND LICENCE FEE 
VOTED FOR BY PARLIAMENT AND ALL 
THAT STUFF THEREFORE THE B. B. C. HAS A 
CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S 
PARTLY WHAT BEN ELTON WAS SAYING 
HE WASN'T SAYING PART OF THE 
POINTS WAS HE THINKS THE AVERAGE 
MUSLIM IN THE STREET DOESN'T WANT 
SPECIAL TREATMENT AND THEREFORE 
HE JUST WANTS TO BE HE IS TRYING 
TO SAY RELIGION SHOULDN'T BE BEYOND 
CRITICISM 
ANYONE GOT AN ISLAMIC CRITICISM JOKE 
THIS IS NOT MY JOKE BUT A JOKE COMMENT ABOUT MY GRANDMOTHER WHO 
WAS A MUSLIM SHE BECAME TO BRITAIN 
FROM IRAN AS A HOLIDAY SHE CAME 
OVER A HOLIDAY AND WAS WATCHING T. V. 
IT WOULD BE WAS WHEN THE WOULD BE 
BOMBERS WAS HAPPENING SHE COULDN'T 
SPEAK ENGLISH I EXPLAINED IT TO 
HER AND THEY SAID THEY'RE NOT 
MUSLIMS THEY'RE SUNNIS COMING 
FROM MY GRANNY THAT'S A FUNNY JOKE 
IT WAS A GOOD THING
