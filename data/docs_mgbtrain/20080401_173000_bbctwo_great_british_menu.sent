THE FIGHT GOES ON 
OUR TOP CHEFS ARE BATTLING FOR THE CHANCE TO PROVE THAT 
BRITISH FOOD IS AMONGST THE BEST IN THE WORLD 
THE WINNERS WILL SERVE UP A FABULOUS FOUR COURSE MEAL AT THE TOP OF THE GHERKIN IN CENTRAL LONDON 
HOSTING THE BANQUET WILL BE THE CULINARY TRAILBLAZER HESTON BLUMENTHAL 
AND HIS GUESTS WILL INCLUDE SOME OF THE WORLD'S GASTRONOMIC ELITE SO THE CHALLENGE FOR OUR CHEFS IS IMMENSE 
TOUGHING IT OUT IN THIS WEEK'S HEAT TO REPRESENT THE CENTRAL REGION IN OUR FINALS ARE GLYNN PURNELL 
AND SAT BAINS AND THEY'VE BOTH GOT THEIR EYES ON THE PRIZE 
WE BOTH WANT TO GET TO THE FINAL 
THERE IS GOING TO BE FIREWORKS 
I'VE GOT A FEW THINGS UP MY SLEEVE AND I'M SURE SAT HAS 
GLYNN AND SAT ARE WELL MATCHED AS BOTH 
CONSIDER THEMSELVES AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF MODERN BRITISH COOKING 
TO SHOWCASE THEIR TALENT EACH CHEF HAS DESIGNED AN ORIGINAL FOUR COURSE MEAL 
EVERY DAY THIS WEEK THEY'LL BE COOKING A DIFFERENT COURSE 
BEFORE PRESENTING THE WHOLE MENU TO THE JUDGES 
THEY WILL DECIDE WHETHER IT'S SAT OR GLYNN 
WHO GOES ON TO REPRESENT THE CENTRAL REGION IN THE FINAL 
ONLY ONE CHEF CAN WIN BUT THIS WEEK GREAT BRITISH MENU 
IS GETTING EVEN MORE PERSONAL AND THESE TWO ARE ALSO CLOSE FRIENDS 
WE'VE BEEN BUDDIES FOR A LONG TIME BUT HE WANTS TO WIN 
SO MAYBE IT'S GOING TO PUMP UP A LITTLE BIT NOW 
I'M HERE TO WIN FINGERS CROSSED HE PUTS UP A GOOD FIGHT 
YESTERDAY THE TWO CHEFS BEGAN BY COOKING THEIR STARTER COURSE 
SAT WENT FOR 
GLYNN LAUNCHED INTO THE WEEK WITH 
TWO VERY STRIKING DISHES ONE SIMPLE ONE FUN 
TODAY THOUGH IS A NEW DAY AND THE TWO CHEFS FACE 
A NEW CHALLENGE COMING UP WITH A THOROUGHLY MODERN FISH COURSE 
MORNING SAT HOW ARE YOU NOT TOO BAD HAVEN'T SEEN YOU FOR AGES 
GOT TO BE AT LEAST WHAT TWELVE HOURS WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE 
BIRMINGHAM OBVIOUSLY IS NOWHERE NEAR THE SEA BUT WE HAVE GOT ONE OF THE BEST FISH MARKETS IN 
YEAH THE COUNTRY AND I WANTED TO KEEP IT WITHIN MY LITTLE REGION SO I DECIDED TO GO 
WITH A RIVER FISH 
I THOUGHT I'D TRY A BIT OF PIKE THAT'S BEAUTIFUL 
HE'S EVEN SERVING MISO GRAVY 
VERY CHEF Y. 
IT'S A VERY JAPANESE MENU IT IS A LITTLE BIT YEAH 
BUT THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM AS THE RULES HAVE CHANGED THIS YEAR 
TO OPEN UP THE DEBATE ON MODERN BRITISH COOKING AND DISPLAY OUR CHEFS' CULINARY SKILLS PROPERLY 
THEY CAN NOW USE PRODUCE OR IDEAS FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD 
AS LONG AS THE MAIN INGREDIENT IS BRITISH JUST LIKE GLYNN'S PIKE 
I JUST WANT TO SEE IF I CAN GET A BIT OF A SMILE FROM OLIVER 
YOU WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
O. K. MY FISH COURSE IS MONK FISH CHEEKS 
VERY THIN I'M NOT SURE IF I'M GOING TO ROAST THEM YET OR RAW 
BELLY PORK UM I THOUGHT IT WAS FISH COURSE 
THERE'S MORE MEAT ON THERE THAN MY MAIN COURSE YOURS AS WELL 
LET ME JUST CHECK THE MENU 
NO IT'S DEFINITELY A FISH COURSE YOU'RE DOING THIS MORNING MATE 
I'M ACTUALLY COOKING A POT NOODLE JAPANESE STYLE YEAH 
BUT AT LEAST IT'S ALL FISH I'M NOT USING ALL THAT 
I SHOULD THINK NOT 
BUT NOT TO BE OUTDONE ON THE EXTRAS 
THERE'S A PEANUT FLAVOURED DRINK 
IT'S UNUSUAL BUT SAT'S NEVER DONE THINGS THE CONVENTIONAL WAY 
HE WON THE CENTRAL REGION HEAT LAST YEAR AND HE'S DETERMINED TO GET ANOTHER TEN OUT OF TEN RESULT 
I WANT TO GET TO THE FINAL 
BORN IN DERBY SAT NOW RUNS THE FIRST AND ONLY MICHELIN STARRED RESTAURANT IN NEARBY NOTTINGHAM 
HIS TRAINING BEGAN AT THE LOCAL CATERING COLLEGE BUT HIS CAREER ONLY KICKED OFF 
IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHEN SAT ENTERED AND WON THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD FOR YOUNG CHEFS THE ROUX SCHOLARSHIP 
I REMEMBER THE MOMENT JUST BEFORE THEY CALLED MY NAME 
I THINK MY HEAD WAS IN MY HANDS AND I JUST THOUGHT JUST SAY MY NAME 
AND THE FIRST PRIZE GOES THE SCHOLARS GOES TO SAT BAINS 
IT STILL FILLS ME WITH GREAT JOY OF THE DAY AND I HEARD AMANDA MY WIFE SCREAM IN THE BACKGROUND 
IT WAS GREAT 
I CAME FROM NOWHERE I WAS OUT OF WORK THE RESTAURANT HAD CLOSED 
I WAS COOKING FOR MY LIFE 
EVEN TODAY ALBERT ROUX DISTINCTLY REMEMBERS SAT'S CULINARY SKILLS 
THAT GUY HAS TO BE THE WINNER 
AFTER FIFTEEN MINUTES LOOKING AT HIM WORKING THE METHOD HIS CLEAN BOARD 
HE KNEW EVERY BITS AND PIECES OF WHAT HE WAS DOING 
THE ROUX SCHOLARSHIP ITSELF WHAT IT MEANS TO ME AS A CHEF IT GIVES YOU KUDOS 
THE ROUX BROTHERS WOULD HAND YOU 
THE DOORWAY TO THE FUTURE BUT YOU'VE GOT TO KICK THAT DOOR DOWN 
SINCE THEN HE MAY HAVE LOST HIS HAIR BUT HE'S GAINED A WIDE REPUTATION FOR IMAGINATIVE MODERN FOOD 
SO THIS YEAR GREAT BRITISH MENU IS RIGHT UP HIS STREET AS IT'S ALL ABOUT TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BRITISH COOKING 
I THINK THE COMPETITION THIS YEAR IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE FOOD THAT WE KNOW 
BUT IT'S ALSO ON THE SLANT OF BEING HOPEFULLY INNOVATIVE MODERN AND EXCITING 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN SAT IS AS ALWAYS COOL CALM AND COLLECTED 
THE ONLY THING HE NEEDS TO DO IS SALT THE BELLY PORK 
HE'S USING WITH HIS MONKFISH CHEEKS AND LEAVE IT TO CHILL IN THE FRIDGE 
PORK SALTED DONE 
GLYNN HAS A LOT OF PREP TO DO AND BOUNCES AROUND THE KITCHEN LIKE A RUBBER BALL 
HE MAY LOOK A BIT CHAOTIC BUT HE KNOWS HIS STUFF 
AND HAS A MIND BURSTING WITH IDEAS 
TWO FILLET ONE DUCK AL A CARTE 
GLYNN PURNELL IS WIDELY CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING CHEFS IN THE MIDLANDS 
BORN IN BIRMINGHAM GLYNN HAS WON MANY ACCOLADES 
INCLUDING A MICHELIN STAR FOR HIS INNOVATIVE APPROACH 
TO PUT BIRMINGHAM ON THE CULINARY MAP AS A BRUMMIE IS FANTASTIC 
FOR MYSELF AND ALSO FOR THE CITY 
AND IN RETURN THE CITY PROVIDES HIM WITH INSPIRATION FOR WHAT HE TERMS BRUMMIE FUSION FOOD 
I LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR MULTICULTURAL COMMUNITY 
I TRY AND REFLECT THAT IN MY COOKING 
SO HOW DOES HE FEEL COMPETING AGAINST HIS FRIEND SAT BAINS 
I'VE KNOWN SAT FOR YEARS WE'VE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS WE SHARE IDEAS TOGETHER 
WHEN YOU FIRST MEET HIM HE'S A BIT OF A COLOSSUS OF A MAN 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY HE'S A BIG SOFT BEAR 
I WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED IF I LOST BUT IF SOMEONE LIKE SAT BEAT ME 
I'D BE A WORTHY LOSER TO HIM 
TO GLYNN FINE DINING SHOULD BE FUN DARING AND EVEN CONTROVERSIAL 
THIS YEAR'S GREAT BRITISH MENU SEEMS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO SHOW OFF HIS CULINARY SKILLS 
I LIKE TO PUT A BIT OF RISQUE INTO IT SOME DISHES ARE INFLUENCED 
FROM MY UPBRINGING IN BIRMINGHAM ESPECIALLY HADDOCK WITH CORNFLAKES 
AND THE SMOKED HADDOCK FOAM WITH A POACHED EGG YOLK 
FISH WITH AND WITHOUT CORNFLAKES APPEARS REGULARLY ON GLYNN'S MENU AND DESPITE BEING BASED 
IN THE CENTRE OF THE COUNTRY HE KNOWS WHERE TO GO FOR FRESH PIKE 
BIRMINGHAM'S BUSTLING FISH MARKET 
O. K. GLYNN YOUR PIKE'S THERE MATE OH LOVELY 
BEAUTIFUL SPECIMENS THERE NICE 
I MEAN THEY LOOK LOVELY THEY'RE FIRM THEY SMELL 
AND GLYNN'S BEEN GIVING PIKE THE YUMMY BRUMMIE TREATMENT EVER SINCE 
HE'S READY 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN GLYNN'S BEGINNING TO PREPARE HIS PIKE SAT'S CURIOUS 
SOMETIMES IF YOU WHIP IT OPEN YOU CAN SOMETIMES FIND LITTLE FISH IN IT 
YEAH LITTLE FISH IT THERE WE'VE GOT ROE IN HERE 
THAT'S A BIG ROE YOU RECKON YOU CAN EAT THAT 
NO IT'S A LITTLE BIT MUDDY IN FLAVOUR 
STRONG SMELL AS WELL ISN'T IT CAN YOU SMELL IT 
YOU CAN SEE IT'S FRESH YEAH FROM THE GILLS 
THE EYES THE GILLS YOU CAN SEE IT'S HAD QUITE AN ACTIVE LIFE 
WHEN YOU SEE FARMED FISH THEIR TAILS ARE ROUNDED WHEREAS YOU SEE A WILD FISH IT'S LIKE THAT 
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT DO YOU EVER PUT IT ON THE MENU 
NO I'M NOT A MASSIVE FAN BE HONEST 
BUT I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS 
IT JUST SOUNDS SO SO DIFFERENT 
WE'LL FIND OUT LATER WHETHER GLYNN CAN CHANGE SAT'S MIND ABOUT PIKE BUT HE KNOWS IT'S A GAMBLE 
YOU'RE TAKING A BIT OF A RISK TO RUN THROUGH THAT 
I'M GOING TO DO PIKE BUT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WELL MIGHT AS WELL STICK THE OLD NUTS ON THE LINE 
PIKE USED TO BE A POPULAR FISH IN BRITAIN SO THE JUDGES MAY LIKE GLYNN 
BRINGING IT BACK AS A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY JAPANESE BRUMMIE FUSION DISH 
BUT IT'S NOT TO EVERYONE'S TASTE INCLUDING SAT'S AND HE'S GONE FOR THE SAFER OPTION OF MONKFISH 
IT'S A SEA FISH AND HE WANTS IT REALLY FRESH 
IT'S SIX THIRTY A M. AND SAT'S TRAVELLED NORTH EAST 
TO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FISH MARKETS IN EUROPE 
GRIMSBY 
HIS AIM AT THIS UNGODLY HOUR 
TO FIND SOME FRESH MONKFISH AT A BARGAIN PRICE 
READY TO OUTBID THE LOCALS NOW SO JUST GET MY REGALIA ON 
TO START THE BIDDING WAR 
TO HELP HIM IN HIS QUEST SAT MET UP WITH GRAHAM KAY 
HE'S BEEN IN THE FISH TRADE SINCE HE WAS TWELVE SO HE SHOULD KNOW A THING OR TWO BY NOW 
SO GRAHAM I'M HERE TODAY TO GET SOME MONKFISH CHEEKS 
ALL RIGHT SO HOW DO I GO ABOUT IT 
WELL THE AUCTION WILL START AT SEVEN 
SALES OF THE HADDOCKS WILL GO FIRST MONKFISH IS FURTHER ALONG 
AND WE'LL BUY FROM THERE BRILLIANT 
HERE'S YOUR MONKFISH AH LOVELY 
I THINK IT'S FASCINATING TO COME DOWN HERE AND ACTUALLY PICK OUT YOUR OWN FISH IT'S GREAT 
I'M BID TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIFTY FIVE 
SIXTY FIVE SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY 
DOES IT EVER GET HEATED GRAHAM SOUNDS A BIT CHAOTIC 
ALWAYS ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S A SHORT MARKET AND THERE'S PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND LIKE WILF 
NINETY SEVEN NUMBER TEN TWENTY SIX 
THE SALESMAN NOW HE'S WATCHING EVERYBODY'S EYES 
HE'LL HAVE BIDS NODS WINKS YEAH LOOK NO ONE'S EVEN MOVING A HAND 
NO NO ONE'S MOVING BUT HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHO'S BOUGHT WHAT FISH 
I'M A BIT NERVOUS NOW I HOPE THEY REALISE I JUST WANT THE CHEEKS 
NOW SAT'S QUITE A BIG MAN BUT HE'S WAY OUT OF HIS DEPTH HERE 
TO THESE SEASONED TRADERS HE'S JUST SMALL FRY 
I HOPE HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING HE COULD BE BUYING A TRUCKLOAD HERE 
SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY ALL DONE 
THANK YOU 
JUST GET THEM ON 
I THINK I WENT A BIT CRAZY YOU DID GET CARRIED AWAY A BIT 
THE PRICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TO FOUR QUID AND HOW MUCH DID WE PAY SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY YOU'RE JOKING YEAH 
SORRY ABOUT THAT 
SO SAT LOST THE PLOT A BIT BUT AT LEAST HE'S SUPPORTING THE BRITISH FISH INDUSTRY 
YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE IT TO HIM HE'S GAME HE'LL GIVE ANYTHING A GO 
YOU'RE USED TO SEEING ME LOOK A BIT STUPID SO I WON'T DISAPPOINT YOU 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY JUST IN CASE ONE OF MY EXTREMELY LONG HAIRS GOES ONTO THE PRODUCT 
IS THIS THE MONKFISH THAT I OVERBID FOR 
THAT WAS THE MONKFISH ON THE MARKET THIS MORNING IT IS MASSIVE ISN'T IT 
HE'S JUST GOING TO CUT CHEEKS OUT FOR YOU NOW 
LOOK AT THAT EH THEY'RE LOVELY AREN'T THEY 
NICE AND SILKY YEAH 
NO ONE REALLY USES THEM DO THEY REALLY 
SOLD MAINLY IN EXPORT 
SPANISH MARKET GOES MAD FOR THEM YEAH 
I'LL TAKE ABOUT TWENTY OF THEM PLEASE TWENTY KILOS OR TWENTY NUMBER 
IT'S A MONSTER ISN'T IT 
YEAH NOT THE PRETTIEST FISH BUT ONE OF THE MOST DELICIOUS 
YOU CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO GET YOUR HAND INSIDE THERE 
IT ACTUALLY LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE GLYNN GOBBY 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN AGAIN 
SAT STILL HASN'T DECIDED WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO WITH HIS MONKFISH 
SO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOUR CHEEKS THEN SAT 
I'M DEBATING ROASTING AND RAW 
YES O. K. SO THIS IS THE RAW YEAH 
A BEAUTIFUL THIN 
I'VE JUST TASTED THAT NOW YEAH 
TO SEE 
YOU TASTE THAT OBVIOUSLY INSPIRED BY YOURSELF A BIT OF SOY 
SO TASTE THAT ONE 
IT'S LOVELY ISN'T IT M. M. M. 
SO I'M THINKING OF A COMBINATION OF ALL OF IT IF I CAN INCORPORATE THAT WITH THAT 
SO RAW AND COOKED 
SO YOU'RE GOING WITH THE TWO TEXTURES OF COOKED AND MMM 
THE DECISION'S MADE AT LAST 
STILL TO COME GLYNN'S WORRIED ABOUT HOW HIS PIKE NOODLES ARE TURNING OUT 
HEY HOW'RE THEY DOING 
AND SAT'S WORRIED TOO WHEN IT COMES TO THE TASTINGS 
DO I HAVE TO EAT THIS 
BOTH CHEFS ARE KEEN TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT REFLECTS THEIR STYLE AND WILL STAND OUT AS MODERN COOKERY 
AT THE END OF THE WEEK 
THE FRESHNESS COMES WITH PICKLED CAULIFLOWER GRANNY SMITH APPLE 
IT WILL BE COOL EVERYTHING IS IN THE FRIDGE 
I'M PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES BY DOING A FISH NOODLE 
IF IT'LL GO DOWN I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
IT'S ABOUT GETTING UP IN THE MORNING HAVING ANOTHER GO 
SEEING WHETHER YOU CAN MOVE THE BOUNDARIES WITHOUT UPSETTING THE DINER 
THIS YEAR IS CERTAINLY ABOUT PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 
THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THESE CHEFS DOES MODERN COOKING BEST 
IT'S TIME FOR SAT TO RINSE THE EXCESS SALT OFF THE PORK BELLY 
AND OF COURSE SAT THE SCIENTIST ISN'T JUST COOKING IT IN A PAN 
AFTER VACUUM PACKING THE MEAT HE POPS IT INTO A WATER BATH SET AT SIXTY EIGHT CENTIGRADE PRECISELY 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN GLYNN NEEDS TO BLITZ THE PIKE INTO A MOUSSE TO MAKE THE NOODLES 
BUT ONE PROBLEM WITH PIKE IS THAT IT'S A NOTORIOUSLY BONY FISH 
IF YOU FEEL THE BONES THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN NO WAY 
YEAH CHOP THEM 
ONCE HE'S FILLETED THE PIKE AS WELL AS HE CAN GLYNN ADDS EGGS FOUR SPICES AND CREAM 
THE MIXTURE NOW NEEDS TO FREEZE BEFORE IT CAN BE PUT INTO THE PROCESSOR 
LIKE HIS STARTER A LOT OF PREPARATION IS NEEDED 
WHAT DO YOU THINK TO THE JUDGES ON THIS DISH GO FOR IT 
PIKE NOODLES UM I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE HARD MATE THEY'RE HARD 
AT THE SAME TIME AS WINDING UP GLYNN SAT'S MAKING A START ON HIS PEANUT MILK DRINK 
HE DRY ROASTS SOME SALTED PEANUTS BEFORE SOAKING THEM IN WARM MILK 
HE THEN ADDS SOME GLUCOSE SYRUP TO SWEETEN THE MIXTURE AND LEAVES IT TO INFUSE 
VERY SIMPLE VERY SAT BAINS 
I WENT TO INDIA WHEN I WAS ABOUT TWELVE AND ONE DISH I ALWAYS LOVED WAS ALMOND MILK IT'S A COLD DRINK 
YEAH AND YOU DRINK THIS MILK AND IT WAS THE MOST REFRESHING ICE COLD ALMOND MILK 
SO I WAS KIND OF REMEMBERING THAT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
GLYNN WANTS TO MAKE A SWEET CORN PUREE TO GO WITH HIS PIKE 
EVEN A MICHELIN STARRED CHEF DOESN'T USE FRESH CORN FOR A PUREE 
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT IT HAS PLENTY OF FLAVOUR 
WHEN I GO FISHING I NORMALLY SIT THERE EATING IT ON A BANK 
IT'S LIKE SOME CHEFS WOULD FROWN AT THAT AND SAY HANG ON 
THAT'S NOT THIS THAT'S NOT THAT BUT THE FLAVOUR 
BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS CREATE THAT IN A PUREE 
SO YOU GET THE SMOOTHNESS 
TO MAKE THE SWEET CORN PUREE GLYNN HEATS THE CORN IN CHICKEN STOCK BEFORE BLENDING IT 
BUT HE'S MISJUDGED THE AMOUNTS 
AND IT'S LOOKING MORE LIKE SWEET CORN SOUP THAN PUREE 
THE SWEET CORN'S JUST SLIGHTLY LOOSE 
ARE YOU GOING TO PUREE IT 
AS IT'S SEASONED I'LL SEASON IT AS IT COMES DOWN BUT 
WHAT'S THAT WHAT HAVE YOU PUT IN THERE THEN JUST CHICKEN STOCK 
IT JUST GIVES THE PIKE A BIT OF SWEETNESS BECAUSE IT CAN BE QUITE EARTHY 
THERE'S A PATTERN HERE 
GLYNN LOOKS HOT AND FLUSTERED WHILE SAT AS USUAL IS COOL AS A CUCUMBER 
OR IN THIS CASE THE AVOCADO HE'S CHILLED FOR THE TERRINE HE'S MAKING 
BUT GLYNN THINKS HIS MORE COMPLICATED DISHES MAY BRING HIM VICTORY AND HIS NEXT STEP 
IS TO BLITZ THE PIKE HE'S FROZEN TO TURN IT INTO A MOUSSE 
SO WHAT'S NEXT OH YES HE NEEDS TO PREPARE THE ENOKI MUSHROOMS 
I WANT TO SERVE THEM RAW ARE THEY NICE 
YEAH VERY NICE WHAT ARE THEY NUTTY 
THEY'RE QUITE LOVELY THEY'VE GOT THIS DISTINCTIVE SORT OF 
THEY ARE NICE SILKY 
SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF VINAIGRETTE WITH THEM 
THIS IS JUST THE SORT OF UNUSUAL EXOTIC INGREDIENT 
THAT THE JUDGES MAY LIKE SO GLYNN WENT IN SEARCH OF THE BEST 
HE SET OUT ON A JOURNEY TO THE EAST BUT NOT QUITE AS FAR AS HE'D IMAGINED 
I'VE BEEN USING THEM FOR YEARS 
I'VE USED THEM IN SALADS AND ROASTED BUT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE IMPORTED 
I READ THE PACKET A FEW WEEKS AGO AND I FOUND OUT IT'S FOUR JUNCTIONS DOWN THE M. FORTY TWO 
SO INSTEAD OF TOKYO OR TAIWAN HE MET TIM LIVESEY AT THE MUSHROOM BASKET 
IN PACKINGTON IN LEICESTERSHIRE 
HIS EXOTIC MUSHROOMS ARE SOURCED FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD 
THEY GROW AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES HUMIDITY AND SOILS DEPENDING ON THEIR TYPE 
ALL RIGHT GLYNN HOW ARE YOU TIM I'M ALL RIGHT HOW ARE YOU 
SO NO MESSING ABOUT TIM IS IT TRUE YOU GROW ENOKI MUSHROOMS IN THE MIDLANDS NO 
WE GROW EN O. KI MUSHROOMS 
OH I'VE BEEN SAYING IT WRONG SO IT'S EN O. KI EN O. KI YEAH 
HERE WE ARE GLYNN 
NEVER MIND GLYNN'S LITTLE VINAIGRETTE THERE'S ENOUGH ENOKIS HERE TO FEED A SMALL ARMY 
I'M SHOCKED AND YOU GO ALL THE WAY ALL THE WAY BACK 
AND WE ALWAYS THINK MUSHROOMS ARE GROWN IN A WARM ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S QUITE COLD 
THEY GROW IN THE WINTER TIME WHEN THERE'S FROST ON THE GROUND 
THEY'RE ONE OF THE FEW THAT LIKE THE REALLY COLD TEMPERATURES 
SHALL WE TRY ONE YEAH 
M. M. M. 
NICE AREN'T THEY GLYNN LOVELY 
TELL ME WHY THEY GROW THEM WITH A CONE ROUND IT 
JUST TO GET A NICE UNIFORM SHAPE 
SO GLYNN'S DISH IS TURNING OUT TO BE FAR MORE REGIONAL THAN HE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT 
PEOPLE THINK IT WOULD BE QUITE DIFFICULT TO CREATE A FISH DISH IN THE MIDLANDS 
I'VE GOT PIKE FROM BIRMINGHAM MARKET ENOKI MUSHROOMS FROM THE NATIONAL FOREST 
WE'RE PUTTING THEM BOTH TOGETHER TO SEE WHAT THE JUDGES THINK OF THAT 
IN FACT GLYNN PRACTISED ON THAT PIKE AND BOUGHT ONE AT BILLINGSGATE FOR TODAY IS THAT THE MOUSSE 
YEAH CAN I TASTE IT 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT IT'S NOT AS EARTHY AS YOU FIRST THINK NO 
BUT GLYNN BELIEVES IN HIS DISH AND ADDS THE BUCKWHEAT FLOUR TO MAKE THE MOUSSE INTO NOODLES 
SAT SEEMS TO HAVE REAL PROBLEMS WITH THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS DISH 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE JUDGES' REACTIONS WILL BE IN TERMS OF 
I KNOW WHAT I THINK MODERN BRITISH CUISINE IS TODAY I BELIEVE WE'RE DOING IT 
SO HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE PERCEIVED BY DOING A JAPANESE DISH 
UM USING LOCAL FISH OBVIOUSLY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'LL SAY 
THERE COULD BE A BIT OF NEGATIVITY WITH IT 
THEY'RE QUITE HARD AND BRUTALLY HONEST 
I THINK IT'S OPENED UP THIS YEAR 
IF YOU LOOK AT MODERN BRITISH CUISINE TODAY IN THE RESTAURANTS AND THE CHEFS WE KNOW 
YEAH THEY'VE GOT INFLUENCES FROM ALL OVER GLOBE OH YEAH FOR SURE 
MASSIVE INFLUENCES IT'S DEFINITELY A YOUNGER MAN'S GAME AS WELL 
HEY NO HOPE FOR ME THEN YOU'RE YOUNGER THAN ME 
NICE ONE GLYNN 
IT'S CRUNCH TIME GLYNN NEEDS TO PIPE HIS NOODLES INTO THE MISO STOCK 
WILL IT BE A TRIUMPH OR A TRAGEDY 
SAT'S DESPERATE TO KNOW WHETHER HE'S PULLED IT OFF 
HEY HOW ARE THEY DOING YEAH ALL RIGHT YEAH 
I'M REALLY NERVOUS FOR HIM 
IF THIS DISH WORKS WOW HE PULLED IT OFF BUT THERE'S A LOT OF RISK 
BUT THE STAKES ARE HIGH TOO 
THE PRIZE MAY BE THE FINALS AND EVEN THE GHERKIN BANQUET 
WE'RE INTO THE FINAL STAGES AND BOTH MEN MOVE UP A GEAR 
SAT FRIES AND SLICES THE PORK BELLY AND PREPARES THE MONKFISH CHEEKS 
HE'S NOW DECIDED TO SERVE THEM IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS COOKED 
RAW AND MARINATED IN SOY SAUCE 
HE NOW ADDS RAW CAULIFLOWER NUTS AND SEEDS AND THEN A SLICE OF AVOCADO 
FINALLY SOME SLICED APPLE AND SHOOTS COMPLETE THE PLATE 
IT LOOKS HEALTHY AND MODERN 
SAT'S THROWING DOWN THE GAUNTLET 
GLYNN'S HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE 
THE NOODLES HAVE COOKED IN THE MISO GRAVY AND ARE READY TO PLATE UP 
GLYNN ADDS SOME CHEFY TOUCHES WITH HIS SWEET CORN PUREE 
AND NOW THE RAW CAULIFLOWER AND ENOKI MUSHROOMS 
HE FINISHES THE PLATE WITH SOME FRESH SUMMER HERBS 
FINALLY GLYNN POURS THE MISO GRAVY INTO THE CAFETIERE WELL MOST OF IT ANYWAY 
THEY'RE FRIENDS THEY'RE RIVALS AND THEY'RE READY 
SO YOU POUR THAT ON YOURSELF IT JUST FILTERS THROUGH 
AND THERE WE HAVE 
BOTH UNUSUAL AS SAT BAINS HAS USED MONKFISH CHEEKS AND BELLY PORK 
GLYNN PURNELL'S MADE NOODLES OUT OF FRESH PIKE IT'S TIME FOR THE TASTING 
SAT TRIES HIS MONKFISH AND BELLY PORK IN THE KITCHEN WHILE GLYNN 
TAKES HIS PLATE INTO A PRIVATE ROOM SO HE CAN REALLY SAY WHAT HE THINKS 
AND HE'S ALREADY NOTICED THERE'S EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF EACH MAIN INGREDIENT 
IS IT A FISH DISH IS IT A MEAT DISH 
IT'S NOT A FISH DISH REALLY IS IT THE JUDGES MIGHT AGREE 
I'M GOING TO MAKE THE PORK A LITTLE BIT SMALLER 
I DON'T WANT THEM TO THINK IT'S A PORK DISH 
I WANT THE FLAVOUR AND THE INTENSITY OF THE PORK 
BUT HAS SAT BEEN A BIT LAZY 
HE HAD THESE SHOOTS BUT USED SOMETHING SIMILAR ON HIS STARTER 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HE'D DOING FOR HIS MAIN COURSE BUT IF HE PUTS THESE ON AGAIN 
I KNOW YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR STYLE BUT YOU HAVE TO 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EACH DISH REALLY 
THE PEANUT MILK GOES DOWN WELL THOUGH 
THIS ITSELF IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC THE MILKSHAKE REALLY IS BUT BUT 
HAVING A MEAL OR A BANQUET YOU'D PROBABLY HAVE A GLASS OF WINE 
SO MILKSHAKE GLASS OF WINE SICK NOT SURE 
HE'S GOT A POINT THERE SAT THE SCIENTIST MAY HAVE SLIPPED UP WITH THE CHEMISTRY 
HE SEEMS HAPPY WITH IT THOUGH 
I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT THE JUDGES THINK THAT'S MY DISH 
I'M HAPPY WITH IT I WANT THAT GOING OUT THERE 
H. M. M. SAT SOUNDS A BIT DEFENSIVE AND GLYNN'S CONVINCED HE KNOWS WHY 
I MIGHT HAVE THIS ONE IN THE BAG 
IT LOOKS MORE EXECUTED CHEFY BUT MINE'S GOING TO BE IN THE EATING OF IT 
WELL THE BOOT'S ON THE OTHER FOOT NOW 
IT'S SAT'S TURN TO TASTE GLYNN'S PIKE NOODLES AND HE DOESN'T LOOK TOO KEEN 
DO I HAVE TO EAT THIS 
I SUPPOSE THE PRESENTATION COULD BE IMPROVED 
I THINK IT LOOKS A BIT OF A MESS TO BE HONEST 
IT NEEDS REFINING 
IT'S A FISH COURSE AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS 
BUT GLYNN SEES THE DISH RATHER DIFFERENTLY 
I WAS WORRIED IT WAS GOING TO LOOK LIKE SOMETHING THAT WAS LEFT BEHIND BY MY JACK RUSSELL 
BUT NOW IT'S LOOKING LIKE A VERY ELEGANT FEMALE DISH 
MEN ARE FROM MARS AND WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS 
I'M NOT SURE WHICH PLANET GLYNN'S FROM BUT WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE 
THE BROTH AND THE CONCEPT IS GREAT BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TASTE THE FISH 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO REPRESENT GREAT BRITAIN AND YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE THIS 
TO SEVENTY GOURMANDS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD YOU WANT TO SAY THIS IS WHAT WE'VE GOT IN OUR RIVERS 
YOU COULD USE ANY FISH FOR THAT I DON'T THINK IT CELEBRATES PIKE 
BUT GLYNN'S MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE BALANCE 
I THINK EASE UP ON THE SESAME SEED OIL 
EASE UP ON THE HERBS A LITTLE BIT 
LET THE PIKE SHINE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MASKED 
BUT HE DID SAY IT WAS A DISH TO BE EATEN 
IT WILL EITHER BLOW UP IN MY FACE 
OR THEY'LL SAY THIS IS MODERN BRITISH COOKERY 
THE JUDGES MAY LOVE THE CONCEPT 
THEY COULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS AND SAY THAT WAS GENIUS 
WHO KNOWS I'M NOT A JUDGE I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE 
WELL WE'LL HEAR WHAT THE JUDGES THINK ON FRIDAY 
TOMORROW THE TWO RIVALS FIGHT IT OUT OVER THE MAIN COURSE AND WILL GLYNN'S HOPES GO UP IN SMOKE 
THIS IS THE SECOND BOARD I'VE USED 
IT'S LIKE THE TERMINATOR 
THE COMPETITION CONTINUES TOMORROW ON GREAT BRITISH MENU
