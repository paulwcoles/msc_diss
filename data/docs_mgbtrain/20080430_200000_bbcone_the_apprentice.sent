THANK YOU THAT IS THE SIGN OF A GOOD SALESPERSON

ON THE LOSING TEAM LUCINDA'S ACCUSATIONS ABOUT JENNIFER CAME TO A HEAD 
YOU'VE SAID YOU FEEL SHE'S A SNAKE AND SHE'S EVIL AND DETRIMENTAL 
IF I WAS GOING TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE WORKING WITH ANYONE IT WOULD BE YOU

I'M LOOKING TO THE PERSON WHO HASN'T 
REALLY BROUGHT ANYTHING TO THESE TASKS

SIR ALAN WANTS YOU TO MEET HIM AT HACKNEY TOWN HALL 
THE CARS WILL BE READY TO PICK YOU UP IN HALF AN HOUR 
LOVELY CHEERS SEE YOU BYE 
YOU ALL RIGHT 
I'VE BEEN AWAKE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF 
JUST WAITING FOR THAT BASTARD PHONE TO RING 
SIR ALAN HAS TOLD THE TEAMS TO MEET HIM IN THE EAST END OF LONDON DESTINATION HACKNEY TOWN HALL 
SIR ALAN'S ROOTS ARE IN HACKNEY 
BORN AND BROUGHT UP HERE HE ESTABLISHED HIS FIRST BUSINESSES IN THE AREA 
GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SIR ALAN 
HERE WE ARE AT THE HACKNEY TOWN HALL A WONDERFUL PLACE 
QUITE FAMILIAR TO ME 
MY BIRTH WAS REGISTERED HERE AND MY MARRIAGE 
AND IF MY BLOOD PRESSURE GOES UP ANY MORE IN THE BOARDROOM MY DEATH MIGHT BE REGISTERED HERE ALSO 
NOW I'VE MENTIONED BIRTHS MARRIAGES AND DEATHS AND THOSE ARE OCCASIONS 
WHICH ARE NORMALLY FOLLOWED UP BY SOME FORM OF GREETING CARD 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME UP WITH YOUR OWN SPECIAL OCCASION 
AND THEN GO OFF AND MAKE A RANGE OF FIVE CARDS COVERING THAT OCCASION 
ONCE YOU'VE DESIGNED YOUR CARDS YOU WILL BE PITCHING 
TO THREE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST GREETING CARD RETAILERS 
THE TEAM THAT COMES BACK WITH THE MOST AMOUNT OF ORDERS WILL WIN AND THE TEAM THAT DOESN'T WILL LOSE 
IN THAT TEAM AS USUAL ONE OF YOU WILL GET FIRED 
MICHAEL I NEED TO GET TO KNOW YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE 
SO I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU TEAM LEADER OF ALPHA WOULD YOU STEP OVER THERE 
KEVIN YOU'RE GOING TO BE TEAM LEADER OF RENAISSANCE 
ALL CLEAR O. K. OFF YOU GO 
THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE BY PAUL DUKAS 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH NEW PEOPLE 
I'M EXPECTING AN OPEN MINDEDNESS BY EVERYONE 
IN A CREATIVE TASK COMPLETE LATERAL THINKING IS IMPERATIVE 
I WILL DO ANYTHING TO WIN THE APPRENTICE 
THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYONE I WOULDN'T SCREW OVER 
TO GET THAT SOLE PRIZE AND THAT'S THE ABSOLUTE RESOUNDING TRUTH 
I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC TASK 
IT'S CREATIVE WE'VE GOT CREATIVE PEOPLE 
WE'VE DEFINITELY GOT A STRONGER TEAM 
WE'RE VERY INNOVATIVE AND QUITE CREATIVE 
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER 
AS A LEADER I INSPIRE DEVOTION 
PEOPLE WANT TO WORK FOR ME 
BECAUSE I MAKE THEIR LIFE INSPIRATIONAL 
BY THE AGE OF TWENTY I HAD MY FIRST HOUSE 
BY THE AGE OF TWENTY THREE I HAD MY SECOND HOUSE 
BY THE AGE OF TWENTY THREE I HAD MY PORSCHE 
NOW I WANT A FERRARI AND I'LL DO ANYTHING I CAN 
TO BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN THE WORLD HAS SEEN BY THE AGE OF FORTY 
BASED AT HALLMARK'S LONDON STUDIO BOTH TEAMS HAVE ONE DAY TO INVENT A NEW OCCASION 
TO MARK WITH FIVE GREETINGS CARDS 
GUYS 
WHAT ABOUT A NATIONAL JOKE DAY 
WE BASE IT ON HUMOUR AND IT WOULD BE SIMPLY TO CHEER PEOPLE UP 
MY IDEA IS ALONG THE LINES OF COSMETIC SURGERY 
YOU COULD GIVE A GREETING CARD TO SOMEONE WHO'S ABOUT TO HAVE A BOOB JOB OR A NOSE JOB 
WHATEVER IT MAY BE I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
BOOB JOB FROM MY EXPERIENCE MOST WOMEN ARE HAPPY TO TELL PEOPLE THEY'VE HAD A BOOB JOB 
I THINK INTIMATE THINGS LIKE NOSE JOBS 
MORE INTIMATE THINGS ARE THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO FLAUNT 
THE WAY I LOOKED AT IT WAS YEAH IT'S A FAMILIAL THING 
IT'S FOR FAMILIES TO GIVE THEIR LOVED ONES IF THEY'RE GOING UNDER THE KNIFE 
DOWN THE CORRIDOR KEVIN'S TEAM IS ALSO TRYING TO COME UP WITH AN ORIGINAL OCCASION 
ANOTHER ONE THAT I HAD WAS PROM DAY SORT OF GRADUATION FROM SCHOOL WHICH WAS A VERY 
AMERICAN THING THAT'S SORT OF COMING OVER TO ENGLAND 
ANOTHER ONE WAS THE ENVIRONMENT WE ARE GETTING A HUGE ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS THAT'S GROWING IN THE U. K. 
I WAS ALSO THINKING IF WE COULD ALSO GO FOR A RELIGIOUS THEME 
THERE ARE SO MANY SHOPS I GO TO AND YOU CAN'T FIND EID CARDS OR VAISAKI CARDS 
YOU DO GET THEM IN A FEW SHOPS A VERY LIMITED RANGE THEY'RE VERY FLORAL THERE IS A MARKET FOR THEM 
SORRY COS WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING TO PEOPLE 
HOW DO YOU SEE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CARDS 
THERE ARE DAYS NOW LIKE SAVING THE PLANET DAY AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
SUPERMARKETS ARE PAYING YOU TO RECYCLE YOUR BAGS AND THINGS 
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY QUITE AWARE OF THAT THEMSELVES 
SO WE'RE ALL CLEAR ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO YEAH 
WE'VE GOT FIVE KEY OBJECTIVES 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS RESEARCH COUNT AND ABSOLUTELY NAIL ALPHA TO THE FLOOR BY FOUR O'CLOCK 
ALL RIGHT ABSOLUTELY TEAM RENAISSANCE WELL DONE 
HAVE SOME FUN 
KEVIN SENDS HIS TEAM TO SEE HOW WELL THEIR IDEAS FIT THE HIGH STREET CARD MARKET 
TOMORROW BOTH TEAMS MUST PITCH THEIR CARDS TO THREE RETAILERS 
THE CELEBRATIONS GROUP WITH TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT STORES ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
SUPERMARKET GIANT TESCO 
AND MARKET LEADERS CLINTON CARDS 
I WOULD WANT TO SEND A CARD TO AS MANY FRIENDS AS POSSIBLE TO SAY 
START DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE HUGE IMPACT WE'RE HAVING ON OUR ENVIRONMENT 
WE'RE DESTROYING THE WORLD WITH OUR ACTIONS LET'S TAKE SOME ACTION TO COUNTERACT THAT 
I'M GOING FOR PETS WE'VE GOT TO TARGET AS WIDE A MARKET AS POSSIBLE 
THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT TARGETING THE SMALLEST MARKET POSSIBLE 
I JUST THINK PETS AM I I KNOW BUT I'M COMING UP WITH MORE THAN ONE IDEA 
WE CANNOT JUST FOCUS ON ONE IDEA 
THAT'S FINE WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIFTEEN IDEAS HAVEN'T WE 
THE MORE IDEAS THE BETTER AT THIS STAGE I THINK 
I FEEL THAT I'M NOT HEARD AND I DO HAVE SOME GOOD IDEAS 
YOU SAY IT TO THEM AND THEY'LL JUST IGNORE IT AND WON'T ANSWER 
THAT MAKES ONE THINK THAT THE IDEA'S NOT A GOOD IDEA 
THEN WHEN I MENTION IT AT A LATER OCCASION IT'S LIKE WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US 
THE GREETINGS CARD MARKET IS ALREADY SATURATED 
THE TEAM'S NEW IDEAS MUST STAND OUT 
EXCUSE ME CAN YOU TELL ME IF YOU HAVE ANY CARDS ABOUT DATING 
WE DO YOU DO DO YOU HAVE ANY TO CONGRATULATE SOMEBODY ON LOSING WEIGHT 
YES WE DO BEST FRIEND YES 
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH SUPPORT THE ENVIRONMENT NO 
NOTHING 
AT THE MOMENT THE ENVIRONMENT IS COMING UP ABOVE 
ALL THE OTHER SUBJECTS 
IT'S THE TOPIC THAT I THINK IS THE STRONGEST SO I'M REALLY PLEASED ABOUT THAT 
CONVINCED BY JENNY'S IDEA 
KEVIN GOES FOR A RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CARDS 
TO MARK THEIR NEWLY CREATED SAVE THE PLANET WEEK 
WHEN WE'RE PITCHING TO THESE COMPANIES WE REALLY NEED TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT 
THAT THEY'VE GOT TO THROW THEIR WEIGHT BEHIND IT 
WE SAY THIS IS A FANTASTIC CONCEPT BUT SAVE THE EARTH WEEK 
IS ONLY GOING TO WORK IF YOU PUT YOUR BACKING BEHIND IT 
THIS IS WHY THIS WEEK WE SUPPORT NATIONAL SAVE THE PLANET WEEK 
GO OUT BUY A CARD READ UP ON SOME FACTS AND START MAKING A DIFFERENCE 
IF I COMPARE KEVIN TO AN ANIMAL 
HE'D BE LIKE A PIT BULL TERRIER 
HE BITES QUITE EASILY HE'S QUITE ARROGANT 
IT'S QUITE COMMON WITHIN THE HOUSE THAT PEOPLE THINK HE'S GOT SHORT MAN SYNDROME 
I NEED TO ENSURE THAT I CONTRIBUTE VASTLY TO THE TASK AND PITCHING IS WHAT I DO BEST 
I CAN PUT A LOT OF PASSION IN MY VOICE HE TAKES EVERYTHING VERY SERIOUSLY WHICH IS GOOD 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO IN BUSINESS BUT THE FUN FACTOR IS ABOUT ZERO 
THESE ARE ALL BIRTHDAYS 
THERE'S NOTHING IN THAT MARKET RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO SPEAK TO MORE PEOPLE LET'S SPEAK TO MORE PEOPLE 
MICHAEL'S TEAM IS ALSO ON A RESEARCH TRIP 
VISITING RETAILERS THEY WILL PITCH TO TOMORROW RAEF SPOTS A GAP IN THE MARKET 
MICHAEL IT'S RAEF HERE 
WE ALL KNOW ABOUT VALENTINE'S DAY 
YEAH DURING VALENTINE'S DAY THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE SINGLE PRETTY MUCH FEEL LIKE SHIT 
MY IDEA IS BASICALLY A SINGLES DAY 
RIGHT ANYTHING ELSE NO THAT'S IT 
O. K. BYE 
I LIKE THAT WE CAN THROW THAT IN THE MIX ON OXFORD STREET 
THE SINGLES CARD 
WE ARE LOOKING AT OPENING A MARKET FOR SINGLES 
SO WE'RE CELEBRATING A DAY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY SINGLE CELEBRATING THAT FACT 
FINALLY MY TIME HAS COME I LIKE THAT 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT YEAH WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE THE BEST TIME TO DO A SINGLES DAY 
WOULD YOU DO IT ON VALENTINE'S DAY OR THE DAY BEFORE THE DAY BEFORE 
GIRLS THAT'S FANTASTIC THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP 
CHEERS BYE BYE 
THREE THIRTY P. M. 
WITH SINGLES DAY AGREED MICHAEL CALLS HIS TEAM BACK TO THE STUDIO 
HELLO HOW ARE YOU DOING 
BEFORE STARTING WORK ON DESIGNS MICHAEL NEEDS A VOLUNTEER TO PITCH 
THEIR CARDS TO THE RETAILERS TOMORROW 
I DO PRESENTATIONS BUT IT'S OVER THE PHONE IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
I WANT SOMEONE WHO DOES PRESENTATIONS FACE TO FACE WHO HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE DOING THAT 
SO FIRSTLY I WANT TO KNOW WHO'S ACTUALLY UP FOR PITCHING THE COMPANIES WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO 
RIGHT SO THAT'S EVERYONE 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE DISTINCTION THAT THIS IS A PRESENTATION 
AND NOT A QUICK SALES PITCH ONCE WE GET THAT IN OUR HEADS 
I AGREE WITH THAT 
WITH THAT IN MIND IS EVERYONE STILL UP FOR DOING A PRESENTATION 
YES YES 
I'M GOING TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THAT AND I'M GOING TO PUT RAEF AS THE PERSON 
THAT'S GOING TO DO THE PRESENTATION 
YOU'RE HAPPY WITH THAT RAEF VERY MUCH SO O. K. GOOD 
THE SPOKEN WORD IS MY TOOL 
YOU KNOW THE ART OF SALES 
RELIES HEAVILY ON THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE EFFICIENTLY 
AND THE ABILITY TO PERSUADE 
AND THOSE ARE TWO ABILITIES THAT I HAVE UP TO FULL CAPACITY 
THANK YOU SEE YOU TOMORROW 
SEVEN P. M. 
KEVIN'S TEAM GETS TO WORK ON DESIGNS FOR THE RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CARDS 
ANYONE GOOD AT POETRY AT SCHOOL ANYONE GOOD AT POEMS 
A HOUSE WITH NO INSULATION IS A CRIME AGAINST THE NATION 
DON'T BE A CHEAT KEEP IN THE HEAT AND PROTECT OUR NEXT GENERATION 
I'M DELIGHTED THAT THE SUBJECT OF THE ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN PICKED UP BY THE TEAM 
BUT THEY'RE GETTING REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT 
I'VE EVEN SPOKEN TO KEV TODAY ABOUT HIM GIVING UP HIS PORSCHE 
AND TRADING THAT IN FOR A BICYCLE AS WELL 
GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BY TOMORROW 
WHO WILL DO THE PRESENTATIONS TOMORROW STILL NEEDS TO BE DECIDED BY KEVIN 
WITH REGARDS TO THE PITCH I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY COMPETENT PEOPLE HERE 
ON A RANGE FROM ONE BEING NOT CONFIDENT AT ALL AND FIVE BEING I'M SO CONFIDENT I WOULD SMASH IT 
WHERE WOULD YOU BE 
CLAIRE WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M GONNA SOUND REALLY ARROGANT 
NO NO THE WHOLE POINT IS IT'S NOT ARROGANCE IT'S SELF CONFIDENCE 
DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU COULD GO IN THERE AND JUST SMASH IT TO PIECES 
AND YOU'RE THE PERSON THAT THEY'D WANT TO BUY FROM YEAH DEFINITELY 
THIS FOR ME IT'S QUITE NORMAL 
I DEAL WITH PITCHES EVERY SINGLE DAY I GO TO WORK 
IT DOESN'T REALLY FAZE ME A HUGE AMOUNT 
SARA ON THIS OCCASION I'D FEEL THAT EITHER JENNY OR CLAIRE WOULD BE MORE SUITED TO DOING THE PITCH 
JEN I'M HUGELY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE SUBJECT 
I HAVE A VERY STRONG SALES BACKGROUND 
FOR ME I'M TOTALLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PER CENT CONFIDENT THAT I CAN GO IN THERE AND NAIL A PITCH 
I KNOW I CAN DO THAT 
I MEAN I WOULD REALLY RELISH THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT 
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS ENSURE THAT I CAN CAPTURE EVERYTHING THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO PUT INTO IT 
AND THEN I CAN PUT MY OWN PERSONALITY INTO IT 
I'M QUITE CONFIDENT THAT IF IT CAME DOWN TO IT IF I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH SIR ALAN SUGAR 
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE A CHANCE OF CHALLENGING ME 
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SUCH A POWERFUL STATEMENT 
ANYONE WHO FEELS THAT THE ENVIRONMENT ISN'T WORTH SAVING IS GONNA LOSE THE ARGUMENT 
MIDNIGHT RAEF PUTS SOME FINAL TOUCHES TO HIS SINGLES DAY PITCH 
I'M GONNA SAY THROUGH OUR CARDS WE PUT FORWARD TO YOU 
THE NOTION OF A SINGLES' DAY 
FOR TOO LONG THE CARD MARKET HAS OSTRACISED 
FOR TOO LONG THE CARD MARKET HAS OSTRACISED 
THOSE THAT ARE EITHER ON THEIR OWN 
THROUGH EITHER CHOICE OR CIRCUMSTANCE 
BELIEVE MAN YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR PRODUCTS SO MUCH AND I DO 
THAT THEY'RE GONNA BUY IT FROM YOU IN VOLUMES AND VOLUMES OF STUFF LOVE IT

I'LL LEAVE KEVIN TO CHOOSE THIS ONE 
HE DOESN'T EXACTLY LOOK MANLY DOES HE 
THE BEAUTY OF WIND POWER 
THERE'S SOMETHING RATHER STRANGE 
ABOUT SENDING A CARD IN ORDER TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT 
EVEN IF IT IS MADE OF RECYCLED PAPER 
IT'S GONNA HAVE TO HAVE AN ENVELOPE 
IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE POSTED AND SO ON 
IT'S GOING TO CONTAIN A SORT OF SERMON I THINK 
I NOT SURE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE NECESSARILY WANT WHEN THEY SEND A CARD TO SOMEBODY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK KEVIN 
ON THE OTHER TEAM MICHAEL HAS SENT THE GIRLS TO THE PHOTO SHOOT 
AND HE'S LEFT THEM TO SORT OUT WHO DOES WHAT 
WE NEED TO DISCUSS BETWEEN THE THREE OF US BECAUSE THERE'S THREE OF US HERE 
NOBODY'S TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO 
SO WHAT DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING 
I FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING ANYTHING BUT WE ALL NEED A SAY WE DO NEED TO FIND ROLES 
I TELL YOU WHAT CALL MICHAEL AND ASK HIM HE'S THE BOSS IF IT'S GONNA BECOME AN ISSUE 
IT'S NOT EVEN BECOMING AN ISSUE IT'S NOT WORTH ARGUING OVER I'M NOT LOOKING FOR AN ARGUMENT 
LET'S RING MICHAEL WE DON'T NEED TO CALL MICHAEL 
WE DON'T NEED TO CALL MICHAEL 
ARRIVING AT THE STUDIO THEY STILL CAN'T AGREE 
WITHOUT SOUNDING BIG HEADED A LOT OF THE IDEAS HAVE COME FROM MY HEAD 
AND I KIND OF KNOW IN TERMS OF THE PHRASES AND WHERE I'M GOING WITH IT 
I TOTALLY WANT YOUR OPINION ON IT 
ABSOLUTELY IT NEEDS TO BE A TEAM THING DOESN'T IT 
I'VE GOT ALL THE PROPS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
IT'S ABOUT BEING CREATIVE I'M CREATIVE AND I'M SURE JEN IS AS WELL 
WE ALL NEED TO CONTRIBUTE IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE YOUR IDEAS

WE CAN'T HAVE THREE PEOPLE CLUTTERED ROUND ABSOLUTELY NOT NO 
SO ARE YOU O. K. WITH THAT JEN 
I'M FINE WITH THAT RIGHT I'LL STAY YEAH

I THINK IT'S ALSO ABOUT CREATING A SITUATION OH WOE IS ME 
FEEL SORRY FOR ME PEOPLE MAKING DECISIONS WITHOUT ME NOBODY HAS 
HIYA HOW ARE YOU DOING 
AS THE MODELS ARRIVE THEY DECIDE HELENE AND JENNIFER WILL DIRECT 
WHILE LUCINDA TAKES CARE OF THE PROPS

LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN SPINNING ROUND THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS 
CAN WE HAVE ANOTHER SPINNING SHOT AGAIN WHICH WAY 
THE ONE BEFORE LIKE THAT 
CAN WE NOT HAVE IT JUST TOGETHER TWO WORDS SIDE BY SIDE 
AT THE DESIGN STUDIO PROJECT MANAGER MICHAEL IS WITH THE REST OF HIS TEAM 
BUT HIS LAYOUT THROWS UP A PROBLEM 
THIS IS A RIDICULOUS QUESTION I'M SO INEPT WITH COMPUTERS 
DO YOU HAVE A SPELL CHECK FOR THIS COS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO APOSTROPHE ON S. 
NO IT WOULDN'T BE THERE IT'D BE AFTER THE S. 
LEAVE IT AS IT IS I'M GONNA MAKE A PHONE CALL JUST TO CHECK THAT 
HELLO IS THAT THE TELEGRAPH 
YES CAN I BE PUT THROUGH TO THE EDITOR'S DEPARTMENT PLEASE 
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO IF YOU COULD DO THAT I'D APPRECIATE IT 
I'M MENTALLY INSANE 
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE 
CAN I HAVE THE NUMBER PLEASE FOR THE BRITISH LIBRARY 
WE NEED TO CHECK THAT THESE ARE ALWAYS THE COMPLICATED ONES WHERE THE APOSTROPHE GOES' 
YEAH IT'S SO EASY TO GET IT WRONG 
DO YOU WANT US TO CHECK AND RING YOU BACK 
IF YOU COULD CALL ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT 
I DESPERATELY NEED YOUR HELP DESPERATELY 
WELL I'VE GONE ONTO THE WEB AND AS FAR AS WE CAN MAKE OUT THERE'S NO APOSTROPHE ANYWHERE 
I WOULD IMAGINE IT WOULD BE AFTER THE S. BECAUSE IT'S PLURAL 
EVERYONE'S COMING OUT WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
CAN YOU TRY ANOTHER LIBRARY 
THREE THIRTY P. M. THE PHOTO SHOOT COMPLETED 
THE OTHER HALF OF KEVIN'S TEAM SET OFF TO MEET HIM BACK AT THE DESIGN STUDIO 
I HOPE KEVIN BY THE TIME WE GET THERE I EXPECT HIM TO HAVE THIS PITCH PRETTY MUCH NAILED 
HE'S VOLUNTEERED TO DO IT AND THEY'VE BEEN SAT DOING THE CARDS 
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO PRACTISE IN FRONT OF US THOUGH 
COS SOME RETAIL BUYERS WON'T LISTEN TO SOMEONE DRONING ON 
YES I KNOW MOST DEFINITELY EVEN IF HE DRAWS FROM OUR OPINIONS 
KEVIN'S ENVIRONMENTAL PITCH TO THE RETAILERS IS JUST OVER TWO AND A HALF HOURS AWAY 
BUT HE'S A BANK MANAGER 
THE ONLY PERSON WHO SHOULD BE DOING THIS PITCH IS JENNY 
WHY WE'VE GOT A READY MADE ENVIRONMENTALIST WHO KNOWS THIS SUBJECT INSIDE OUT 
AND IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT COMMERCIAL STUFF 
I'D SAY I'M PROBABLY THE BEST PERSON TO DO IT 
BUT KEVIN DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL STUFF 
JENNY IS THE MAN HERE 
I VOICED THAT LAST NIGHT TO HIM 
I HAVE AS WELL 
WITH SARA'S HELP KEVIN HAS SPENT SIX HOURS ADJUSTING THE CARD'S LAYOUT AND WORDING 
HI GUYS WELL DONE NICE TO SEE YOU 
HE ASKS THE REST OF HIS TEAM FOR A PROOF READ 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE SMALL COS INSULATE YOUR HOME IT'S GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT 
YEAH THEN REDUCE YOUR SMALL E. SMALL C. 
IS IT ITALICS 
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FONT 
I JUST WANT TO CHECK THAT YOU'RE HAPPY IT LOOKS O. K. 
O. K. KEVIN NOT TO BE PEDANTIC DON'T SAY DO YOU LIKE IT 
AND IF I SAY IS IT ITALICS 
AND YOU GO I DON'T CARE I'VE CHOSEN IT 
NO I DIDN'T SAY I DON'T CARE WHAT I SAID IS WE'VE HAD TO MAKE THE DECISION AND IT LOOKS PROFESSIONAL 
BUT WITH THEIR FIRST APPOINTMENT LESS THAN TWO HOURS AWAY 
KEVIN STILL HASN'T STARTED WORK ON HIS PITCH 
WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU GUYS TO DO IF YOU COULD START THE PITCH NOW 
START GETTING SOME INFORMATION TOGETHER WHILE WE FINISH THESE OFF YEAH 
HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING ON THE PITCH YET NO WE'VE LITERALLY 
WE'VE BEEN ON THIS COMPLETELY SO IF YOU COULD START IT 
DO YOU WANNA GO AWAY FROM HERE AND GIVE US SOME SPACE 
I'M NOT LAUGHING 
I FEEL LIKE A NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL 
I CAN TELL THAT THAT KEVIN'S FEELING VERY VERY VERY STRESSED 
AND I DON'T WANT TO PUSH HIM OVER THE EDGE 
I'M REALLY SURPRISED 
ON MICHAEL'S TEAM AFTER THREE AND A HALF HOURS OF ARGUING ABOUT THE APOSTROPHE 
AND THE CARD'S NOT YET PRINTED IT'S DECISION TIME 
MY GRAMMATICAL KNOWLEDGE SAYS PUT IT AFTER THE S. 
O. K. LOOK I TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO 
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE ABOUT IT I'M GONNA PUT THE APOSTROPHE AFTER THE S. 
I'M GONNA LEAVE IT LIKE THAT 
THAT'S THAT DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
WE NEED TO CARRY ON WE'VE GOT SO MANY THINGS TO DO 
WE'VE REALLY LITTLE TIME NOW 
ON THE OTHER TEAM KEVIN STARTS WORK ON HIS PITCH COACHED BY RETAIL BUYER CLAIRE 
I'D WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU'RE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR COMPETITION 
THEN I'D SAY HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT 
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST GO I KNOW THAT I'D WANT TO KNOW WHAT RESEARCH HAVE YOU DONE 
IF YOU WERE STOOD IN FRONT OF THESE PEOPLE YEAH 
DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD REMEMBER FROM START TO FINISH 
THAT COMPLETE PROCESS IS THAT JUST EMBEDDED IN YOU YEAH 
IS IT NOT BETTER TO GET SOMEONE WITH THE MOST EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD TO DO IT 
YOU UNDERSTAND THE INDUSTRY 
NO I PERSONALLY THINK JENNY SHOULD DO THE PITCH 
FOR ME I'M LOVING HOW ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S COMING BACK TO ME 
I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY TO DO THIS PITCH HAD I KNOWN YESTERDAY 
YEAH I ASKED SPECIFICALLY COS I WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO DO IT 
TWO HOURS BEFORE I'M NOT HAPPY TO GO IN AND DO A PITCH 
IT'S NO PROBLEM IT'S FINE WE'LL MOVE ON IT'S O. K. 
I WAS HUGELY DISAPPOINTED THAT KEV REALISED THAT THIS PITCH WASN'T 
GOING TO BE AS SIMPLE AS IT MIGHT SEEM 
HE'D LEFT THE PLANNING OF IT FAR TOO LATE AND AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR DECIDED TO PASS THE BUCK 
I WAS NOT PREPARED TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS FAILINGS AS A TEAM LEADER 
FIVE FIFTY P. M. AFTER TWO DAYS OF WORK PRODUCING THEIR CARDS THE TIME HAS COME TO PITCH 
THE PITCH MUST PERSUADE THE RETAILERS TO PLACE ORDERS FOR THE CARDS 
THE TEAM WITH MOST ORDERS WILL WIN 
FIRST STOP FOR MICHAEL'S TEAM CLINTON CARDS BRITAIN'S BIGGEST CARD CHAIN 
THE TEAM'S NATIONAL SINGLES' DAY SCHEDULED FOR FEBRUARY THIRTEENTH WILL BE PITCHED BY RAEF 
WE HAVE CREATED NOT JUST A CARD 
BUT I BELIEVE WE'VE CREATED AN INDUSTRY AND I BELIEVE WE'VE CREATED A DIARY ENTRY 
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO I'D LIKE TO UNVEIL OUR AFOREMENTIONED CONCEPT 
NATIONAL SINGLES' DAY A DAY IN ESSENCE TO CELEBRATE 
BEING SINGLE 
I THINK YOU'VE MISSED THE POINT 
AT THAT TIME BECAUSE VALENTINE'S IS CERTAINLY WITHIN SECOND OR THIRD OF OUR LARGEST SEASONS 
PROBABLY FORTY PER CENT OF OUR STORE HAS BEEN TURNED OVER TO VALENTINE'S DAY 
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE TRIED TO HAVE IT FIGHT AGAINST ONE OF OUR MAJOR SEASONS 
NEXT NUMBER TWO IN THE GREETINGS CARD BUSINESS TESCO 
I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT WE'VE COME BACK FROM A VERY 
WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE A POSITIVE MEETING WITH THE MARKET LEADER ON THIS PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT 
WITH THAT IN MIND LET'S UNVEIL 
NATIONAL SINGLES' DAY 
A DAY TO CELEBRATE BEING SINGLE 
AND YOU THINK PEOPLE WANT TO CELEBRATE BEING SINGLE ABSOLUTELY 
ON THE DAY BEFORE VALENTINE'S DAY ABSOLUTELY SO LOGISTICALLY ON ONE OF THE BUSIEST DAYS IN 
THE YEAR THE DAY BEFORE YOU WANT TO TRY AND SELL DIFFERENT CARDS TO WHAT'S ALL BEEN SOLD 
THERE ARE SO MANY SINGLE PEOPLE IN THE U. K. AT THE MOMENT THAT DESPISE VALENTINE'S DAY 
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO IS TAP INTO THAT MARKET AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT 
IT'S GOOD TO BE SINGLE IT'S COOL TO BE SINGLE 
LET'S BE PROUD OF BEING SINGLE 
RIGHT 
AND WHO'S GONNA SEND THE CARD 
THERE'S A BIT OF AN ISSUE WITH THE DATE 
THE LAST TWO PEOPLE WE'VE SPOKEN TO SAID THE DAYS WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY 
SO WHY ARE WE HARPING ON ABOUT IT 
DO YOU NOT THINK BY CHANGING THE DATE IT BASICALLY GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN PITCHING 
MY DECISION IS WE'RE GOING TO REMOVE THE DATE FROM THE PITCH 
I DON'T WANT ANY MORE DELIBERATING ABOUT IT I WANT TO GO WITH THE DECISION 
THIRD AND FINAL PITCH THE CELEBRATIONS GROUP 
NATIONAL SINGLES' DAY A DAY TO CELEBRATE BEING SINGLE 
WHEN WOULD YOU PROPOSE THAT DAY WAS HELD 
WE'RE QUITE RECEPTIVE TO SUGGESTIONS 
SO YOU DON'T KNOW 
IT'S NOT A CASE OF NOT KNOWING IT'S UNDERSTANDING THAT 
IF I COULD JUST INTERRUPT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE LOGISTICALLY IT'S VIABLE FOR YOU GUYS AS RETAILERS 
SURE I'VE GOT HALF A DOZEN SINGLE PARENT FRIENDS 
WHO I'D LOVE TO SEND THAT TO IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT 
I GUESS THEY ARE A FORGOTTEN PART OF SOCIETY 
NOW AFTER SOME HURRIED PREPARATION IT'S TIME FOR KEVIN TO PITCH 
HIS TEAM'S ENVIRONMENTAL CARDS TO THE RETAILERS 
THE CONCEPT'S SO STRONG 
YOU WOULD REALLY 
I'D REALLY NEED TO BALLS IT UP BIG TIME FOR IT NOT TO SELL ITSELF 
KEVIN SHAW 
FIRST CLINTONS 
I JUST WANT TO QUOTE YOU SOME FACTS THAT I THINK ARE VERY VALUABLE NOT ONLY TO CLINTON CARDS BUT 
TO EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD WALKING THIS PLANET 
FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION TONNES WORTH OF RUBBISH 
IS THROWN AWAY EACH YEAR IN THE U. K. 
SEVENTEEN BILLION PLASTIC BAGS ARE ALSO THROWN AWAY 
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT A BASIC 
STRAIGHTFORWARD CARD COULD START TO CHANGE THE WAY WE WORK TRAVEL 
LIVE AND HAVE FUN TOGETHER 
I OPEN FOR QUESTIONS 
WHO DO YOU THINK'S GONNA BUY THESE CARDS 
WHO'S YOUR TARGET CONSUMER 
THE TARGET CONSUMER O. K. FINE 
THE TARGET CONSUMER COULD BE NUMEROUS PEOPLE 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LIVE EARTH CONCERT YOU HAD YOUNG CHILDREN FAMILIES SINGLE TEENAGERS 
I THINK I'M MISSING THE POINT THE QUESTION THAT DEBBIE ASKED YOU WAS WHO IS GOING TO BUY IT 
I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE TUNING INTO A CONCERT 
THEY'RE DOING THAT COS THEY'RE GONNA GET MUSIC AND ENJOYMENT FROM IT 
WHAT IS THE MOTIVATION TO GO INTO OUR SHOP AND BUY THIS CARD AND GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY 
WHAT IS THE MOTIVATION TO GO AND BUY THAT 
FIRST OF ALL I KNOW WHO YOUR MARKET IS IT'S EVERYONE 
PEOPLE ARE MORE AWARE OF GREEN ISSUES 
I PERSONALLY HAVE SLOWED DOWN ENORMOUSLY ON THE NUMBER OF CARDS THAT I BUY SIMPLY BECAUSE 
I'M AWARE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF ALL THE PAPER THAT WE'RE SENDING AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY GONNA MAKE SOMEBODY SMILE 
A BATH USES ONE HUNDRED TWENTY LITRES OF WATER WHEREAS A SHOWER ONLY USES THIRTY LITRES 
BEING EFFICIENT IN THE WAY YOU WASH WILL STOP YOUR MONEY GOING DOWN THE DRAIN BATHE LESS SHOWER MORE 
IF YOU DON'T PUT YOUR WEIGHT BEHIND IT THEN 
IT'S JUST THE SAME AS THE U. S. SAYING WE DON'T CARE ABOUT POLLUTION 
DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS NO I HAVE NO MORE QUESTIONS THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU 
THANK YOU NICE TO MEET YOU 
YOU CAN'T GO AND PITCH TO NATIONAL RETAIL CHAINS WITHOUT ANY PREPARATION 
WHAT IF THEY FOUND HIM A BIT ANGRY 
IT HASN'T GIVEN ME ANY WORRIES ABOUT THE CARDS 
AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY WEREN'T THERE TO MAKE OUR JOB EASY 
IF THEY DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT THE ENVIRONMENT CLINTON CARDS ARE AN UNENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY COMPANY 
IF THAT'S THE ATTITUDE EVERYONE TAKES WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SAVE ANY PLANET YEAH 
NEXT CELEBRATIONS HI I'M SARAH GOOD TO SEE YOU 
I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER NICE TO MEET YOU SARAH HI I'M LISA 
KEVIN CAN I JUST ASK WOULD YOU NOT CONSIDER IT A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS THAT SOMEBODY WHO'S ECO FRIENDLY 
WOULD WANT TO PAY FOR A CARD WHEN POTENTIALLY THEY COULD SEND AN E. CARD WOULDN'T THEY DO THAT 
IF YOU'RE ECO FRIENDLY WOULDN'T YOU SAVE THE PAPER THE MATERIALS NO I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD 
BECAUSE I THINK THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS CARD IS WE'RE TRYING TO EDUCATE PEOPLE 
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL LIVE ON THIS PLANET AND WE ALL NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO FIX IT 
RECYCLE RECYCLE RECYCLE 
FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION TONNES' WORTH OF RUBBISH IN THE U. K. IS DISPOSED OF EVERY SINGLE YEAR 
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE IS GOOD 
I'M STRUGGLING TO SEE HOW A GREETING CARD IS THE BEST WAY OF GETTING ACROSS THIS MESSAGE TO PEOPLE 
I BELIEVE IT IS 
YOU COULD HAVE BALLOONS I ASSUME YOU SELL HELIUM BALLOONS WITH THE LOVE OUR PLANET LOGO 
YOU COULD DO MUGS PENS 
YOU COULD HAVE 
ALL RECYCLABLE PRESUMABLY 
YEAH I THINK WE'RE SLIGHTLY MOVING OFF THE POINT OF THIS HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT O. K. 
I THINK YOU'RE SO PASSIONATE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING JUST CHECK YOUR LANGUAGE AND YOUR 
BODY LANGUAGE BECAUSE YOU WERE POINTING IN HER FACE 
AT ONE POINT ONE FELT LIKE IT WAS QUITE AGGRESSIVE 
SO JUST A MENTAL NOTE 
FINALLY TESCO 
I'VE ACTUALLY GOT A VISION AND THAT'S ME WALKING INTO A STORE 
AND STRAIGHT AHEAD OF ME I'VE GOT THE HANGING SIGN WHICH SAYS 
LOVE OUR PLANET WHAT WE'VE COME UP WITH 
AND THE CONCEPT THAT WE'VE DESIGNED IS A VERY ENVIRONMENTALLY BASED PROJECT 
THAT WE BELIEVE CERTAINLY A COMPANY OF YOUR SIZE AND WITH YOUR WEIGHT COULD REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
WHAT WE'RE ASKING YOUR CUSTOMERS TO DO IS ACTUALLY TAKE NOTICE AND THE FACT THAT WE CAN ALL MAKE IT HAPPEN 
O. K. 
I FELT THAT WENT BEAUTIFULLY IT WENT SMOOTHLY 
I FELT LIKE WE CAPTURED HIS HEART AND MIND 
TEAM RENAISSANCE HUG 
WELL DONE GUYS WELL DONE 
YOU CAN GO THROUGH TO THE BOARDROOM NOW 
AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON SIR ALAN 
NOW MICHAEL YOU WERE THE TEAM LEADER 
I WAS YEAH 
YEAH YOUR IDEA WAS 
I DECIDED TO GO WITH RAEF'S IDEA WHICH WAS TO CELEBRATE SINGLEDOM 
YOU WANT TO RUN THAT PAST THIS SIXTY ONE YEAR OLD FART HERE BECAUSE I'M MISSING THE POINT 
WHO'S SENDING IT TO THEM ARE THEY SENDING IT TO THEMSELVES 
NO LET'S SAY YOU'RE GOING INTO A CARD SHOP TO BUY A VALENTINE'S DAY CARD FOR YOUR LOVED ONE 
THERE'S ALSO A SECTION FOR A SINGLE CARD FOR YOUR FRIEND OR YOUR SISTER 
WHY FEBRUARY THIRTEENTH 
WE COULD PLAY ALONGSIDE OR FEED INTO THE VALENTINE'S MARKET 
I'M ONLY THINKING AS A MERCHANDISER MYSELF WHERE AM I GONNA STICK THIS ON THE SHELF IN MY SHOP ON A WEEK 
THAT I'VE GOT TO ALLOCATE SPACE FOR VALENTINE'S DAY IN HINDSIGHT WOULD YOU HAVE CHOSEN A DIFFERENT DATE 
I WOULDN'T HAVE YOU WOULDN'T NO I WAS HAPPY WITH THAT DECISION RIGHT 
HOW WAS MICHAEL AS THE TEAM LEADER 
HE WAS GOOD SIR ALAN GOOD DECISION MAKING WHAT DO YOU THINK HOW WAS HE 
QUITE GOOD ALTHOUGH THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY PERIOD OF FOUR HOURS 
WHERE THEY TOYED WITH AN APOSTROPHE IN THE NATIONAL SINGLES' DAY WHAT WAS THIS GRAMMAR 
YEAH WHICH IS IMPORTANT 
YOU SPENT FOUR HOURS WORKING OUT WHERE THE APOSTROPHE SHOULD GO 
I THINK THE EDITOR DON'T GET IMPATIENT WITH ME YOUNG MAN I'M ASKING YOU A QUESTION 
DID YOU SPEND FOUR HOURS WONDERING WHERE THE APOSTROPHE GOES IT WAS ABOUT THREE HOURS BUT YES 
SORRY 
KEVIN YES SIR ALAN TEAM LEADER 
YES SAME THING REALLY 
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH YOUR TEAM 
WHAT WE WERE POSITIONING IS HAVING A LOVE YOUR PLANET WEEK ONCE A YEAR 
I WANTED TO GET THE POINT ACROSS THAT IF WE DON'T ACTUALLY TAKE NOTICE I. E. 
IF THE G. EIGHT SUDDENLY DECIDED WE'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE 
AND IF THE BIGGEST RETAILER IN THE U. K. COULD PUT THEIR WEIGHT BEHIND IT THAT COULD MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE 
CARDS ARE FOR SENDING A PERSONAL SENTIMENT 
PEOPLE DON'T SEND CARDS TO POLITICALLY PREACH TO PEOPLE 
WHO DID THE PITCHES THEN I DID THE PITCH SIR ALAN 
DID YOU AS A TEAM THINK HE WAS THE BEST PERSON TO GO FORWARD NO 
WE HAD DISCUSSIONS AS A GROUP ABOUT WHO COULD PITCH BECAUSE I'VE GOT RETAIL EXPERIENCE JENNY'S A. 
YEAH YOU ARE A RETAIL BUYER RIGHT 
YEAH KEVIN WAS VERY ADAMANT THAT HE WAS GOOD AT PITCHING AND HE WAS THE BEST PERSON TO DO IT 
YOU SAID I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER I'M GONNA DO IT YEAH 
EVEN BEARING IN MIND THAT SHE IS A RETAIL BUYER 
YEAH I WANTED TO LEARN SIR ALAN AND I HAD CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF 
RIGHT WELL WE'LL FIND OUT 
LET'S SEE HOW THESE RETAILERS RECEIVED YOU 
MARGARET LET'S START OFF WITH TESCO'S HOW DID WE DO THERE 
RENAISSANCE 
TESCO'S BOUGHT SIX THOUSAND CARDS FROM RENAISSANCE 
RIGHT SO THEY LIKED IT 
AND NICK HOW DID TESCO'S LIKE ALPHA'S CARD 
A LITTLE LESS WITH ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
RIGHT CLINTON 
CLINTON'S DIDN'T BUY ANY FROM RENAISSANCE 
AND CLINTON'S FOR ALPHA 
IT'S ANOTHER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FROM CLINTON'S 
AND CELEBRATIONS 
CELEBRATIONS DIDN'T BUY ANY FROM RENAISSANCE 
RIGHT AND CELEBRATIONS FOR ALPHA 
THEY WERE KEENER THEY BOUGHT NINETEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
COME ON COME ON 
THUMPS DESK 
THIS IS NOT A FOOTBALL MATCH 
THIS OUTBURST OF YOURS WHICH IS 
NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD CONDONE NORMALLY IN THIS BOARDROOM I APOLOGISE 
BUT WELL DONE 
NOW I'VE ARRANGED A PRIVATE RECITAL FOR YOU WITH MYLEENE KLASS BACK AT THE HOUSE 
OFF YOU GO AND I'LL SEE YOU ON THE NEXT TASK 
YOU SEE WHEN I HEARD YOUR GREEN IDEA MY INITIAL INSTINCT WAS IT WAS NO GOOD 
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TWO LEADING SPECIALIST RETAILERS AGREE WITH ME 
YOU NEED TO GO AWAY YOU NEED TO TALK AMONGST YOURSELVES 
YOU WILL BE BACK IN THIS BOARDROOM WHERE ONE OF YOU WILL GET FIRED OFF YOU GO 
I THINK THE CONCEPT IS STILL VERY STRONG I JUST THINK OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT COMMERCIAL ENOUGH 
I DON'T THINK THE PITCH COMPARED TO THE LAST PITCH THE FIRST AND SECOND WERE AS CLEAR 
HE TRIED TO SWING THE PITCH BACK TO ME AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR WHICH HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED YET AND 
I'M QUITE HAPPY TO BRING THAT UP AND TO DISCUSS KEVIN'S PRESENTING STYLE WHICH IS ALMOST LIKE A MACHINE GUN 
SARA YOU ONLY DELIVERED A COUPLE OF IDEAS THAT HAVE ALREADY PREVIOUSLY BEEN DONE 
YOU SAID SARA WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS AND I SAID I WANT TO THINK OF THE WIDER MARKETS 
YOU SAID TO ME OF COURSE I'M THINKING OF THE WIDER MARKET WITH THE ENVIRONMENT 
THE ONE PERSON THAT I ABSOLUTELY THINK SHOULD BE FIRED IS SARA 
SHE DELIVERED NOTHING BUT A SMUG LOOK IN THE CORNER 
AND DIDN'T EVEN HAVE ONE TINY LITTLE THING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE TEAM 
BRAVO 
SIR ALAN WILL SEE YOU NOW 
I DON'T SEE THE POINT OF SENDING ONE OF THESE CARDS TO SOMEONE 
AND I THINK WHERE YOU WENT OFF THE RAILS HERE WAS YOU WENT OFF IN SOME KIND OF 
WE'RE GOODIE GOODIES SUPPORTING THIS GREEN AND ENVIRONMENTAL THING 
AND DE FOCUSSED FROM WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WOULD GO AND BUY 
WHO WAS THE PRIME INNOVATOR OF THIS TOPIC THAT WAS ME SIR ALAN 
ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC THAT HAS A PASSION FOR THIS GREEN STUFF 
WOULD SAY THE LAST THING I'M GONNA DO IS BUY A CARD WHICH IS ACTUALLY WORSENING THE CASE 
I DISAGREE WITH THAT SIR ALAN BECAUSE I THINK 
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WEREN'T TRYING TO PREACH TO PEOPLE 
HOW CAN YOU DISAGREE WITH IT 
THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF GREEN IS THAT A PERSON IS TRYING TO ECONOMICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE 
THAT I DON'T WANT TO USE MATERIALS UNNECESSARILY 
WHILE I ACCEPT THAT IN THE LONG HAUL 
THAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THESE GREEN AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES I ALSO TRY TO THINK ABOUT TODAY 
I WOULD HAVE COMPLIMENTED YOU IF YOU CAME UP WITH SOME RANGE OF EVEN 
BEREAVEMENT CARDS THAT SAID SOMETHING LIKE 
SORRY TO HEAR THAT YOUR ELEVEN YEAR OLD BEAUTIFUL CHILD GOT SHOT 
IN THE HEAD BY A HOODIE SORRY TO HEAR THAT YOUR LOVING HUSBAND WITH TWO CHILDREN GOT KICKED TO A PULP 
COS THESE ARE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT IN THIS 
COUNTRY AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT PERHAPS PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE SIGNED ON TO 
TWO OF THESE RETAILERS THAT SPECIALISE IN GREETINGS CARDS THOUGHT YOUR IDEA WAS APPALLING 
IN FACT I CAN TELL YOU KEVIN THAT CLINTON CARDS FOR EXAMPLE REPORTED 
THAT YOUR PITCH WAS DREADFUL 
THEY FOUND YOU A BIT COCKY THEY FOUND YOU PREACHING TO THEM NOT SELLING THEM CARDS 
PREACHING TO THEM THERE WAS A SMELL OF ARROGANCE ABOUT YOU THEY FELT 
SO YOU DECIDED TO DO THE PITCHING RIGHT 
I DID SIR ALAN YEAH 
DID ANYBODY ELSE PUT THEMSELF FORWARD 
YOU TWO DID CAN I JUST SAY THAT I THINK PERHAPS IT WAS A GOOD THING THAT JENNY DIDN'T DO IT 
BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY TOLD CLINTON'S THAT BECAUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS 
SHE WASN'T BUYING SO MANY CARDS ANY MORE IS THAT RIGHT YES I DID SIR ALAN 
HOW CAN YOU MAKE A STATEMENT ON ONE SIDE SAYING I PERSONALLY 
DON'T BUY SO MANY CARDS ANY MORE FOR THIS REASON 
AND THEN COME UP WITH A CONCEPT INITIALLY OF THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD DO 
I REALLY DO PASSIONATELY BELIEVE THAT THAT CONCEPT FULFILS A HOLE IN THE MARKET 
PITCHED CORRECTLY IT COULD HAVE I TELL YOU WHAT IT'S BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION 
KEVIN YOU KNOW WHAT SHE DOES FOR A LIVING YES I KNOW WHAT SHE DOES 
YEAH SHE IS A RETAIL BUYER 
I UNDERSTAND THAT 
SO WHO BETTER THAN A RETAIL BUYER TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO ANOTHER RETAIL BUYER ABSOLUTELY I AGREE 
SO THERE'S THE TIME SOMETIMES WHEN SOMEONE LIKE YOURSELF WHO SEEMS TO ALWAYS WANT TO BE 
IN THE FOREFRONT SHOULD STEP AWAY AND LET SOMEONE ELSE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING LET THEM DO IT 
WHEN WE STARTED TO PREPARE THE PITCH YESTERDAY WHICH WAS AT THREE O'CLOCK I ACTUALLY SAID TO CLAIRE 
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND THEN DID YOU YOU BOTTLED IT A LITTLE BIT NO I HADN'T BOTTLED IT SIR ALAN 
WE WERE ONLY PUTTING THE PITCH TOGETHER SO DID HE ASK YOU THEN TO TAKE OVER 
HE DID THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN WE WERE DOING THE WHY DIDN'T YOU 
KEVIN WAS VERY ADAMANT THAT AS PROJECT MANAGER AND HE 
TO QUOTE HAS NEVER LOST A PITCH IN HIS LIFE WANTED TO DO IT 
HE'S LOST TWO HERE HE WAS VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT DOING IT 
BUT CLAIRE YOU DO THIS FOR A JOB 
I WONDER WHETHER YOU SHOULD HAVE STEPPED IN AND HELPED OUT 
SIR ALAN IN MY BOOK I FELT THAT I DID HELP OUT 
YOU DIDN'T STEP IN YOU ACTUALLY SAID YOU THOUGHT JENNY WOULD BE BETTER THAN YOU 
JENNY HERE CAME UP WITH THE CONCEPT 
I THINK WE'VE ALL AGREED HERE THAT THE CONCEPT WAS NO GOOD 
I WASN'T AWARE OF A HUGE ARRAY OF IDEAS COMING FROM ANYONE ELSE 
THERE WERE A COUPLE BUT I HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT WAS 
DELIVERED FROM SARA THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE FIRST DAY AND I FEEL THAT WE HAVE RUN A RACE AND WE HAVE 
TRIED TO DELIVER SUCCESS WHEREAS SOME PEOPLE HAVEN'T HAVEN'T EVEN TAKEN PART IN THE RACE 
JENNY CAN I JUST GET BACK I FEEL THAT IS REALLY UNFAIR 
JENNY EVERY TIME I TRIED TO PUT AN IDEA ACROSS TO YOU YOU ATTACKED ME COMPLETELY 
THAT IS ABSOLUTE RUBBISH CAN YOU SUPPORT ME ON THIS PLEASE CAN I JUST FINISH ALEX 
KEVIN YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT ME ON THIS COS YOU WERE THERE AND YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS 
HOW MANY HOURS DID IT TAKE US TO DESIGN THE FIRST CARD I WAS WORKING HARD I DID EVERYTHING 
TRUST ME THAT I'M WISE ENOUGH AND OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE GANGING UP ON SOMEBODY 
SO I DISCOUNT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF WHAT I'M HEARING AND TRY AND LOOK THROUGH THE MIST 
CLAIRE YES SIR ALAN 
WHO SHOULD GET FIRED I THINK SARA SHOULD BE FIRED BECAUSE OF HER LACK OF CONTRIBUTION 
SARA APPRECIATION SOCIETY TODAY KEVIN WHO SHOULD BE FIRED 
IF I WAS GOING TO FIRE SOMEONE SIR ALAN I WOULD FIRE 
SARA RIGHT WHICH TWO ARE YOU BRINGING BACK IN THE BOARDROOM WITH YOU 
I'M GOING TO BRING SARA AND CLAIRE 
SARA AND CLAIRE COMING BACK IN 
YOU TWO GO BACK TO THE HOUSE 
YOU THREE GO AND WAIT OUTSIDE AND I'LL CALL YOU BACK IN SHORTLY 
BUT BASICALLY KEVIN IS NOT MATURE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND 
THAT SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR MIDST SOMEBODY WHO CAN ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING BETTER THAN YOU 
THERE IS AN ART IN RECOGNISING THAT SOMETIMES 
CLAIRE 
SHE'S A BUYER WHY SHE DIDN'T STEP IN AND TRY AND SAVE HIM I DON'T KNOW 
WE'LL HAVE TO FIND OUT 
HELLO FRANCES SEND THE THREE OF THEM IN PLEASE YES SIR ALAN 
SIR ALAN'S READY FOR YOU NOW 
KEVIN WHAT'S CLAIRE DOING HERE 
CLAIRE IS HERE SIR ALAN BECAUSE I FEEL 
SHE'S GOT AN AWFUL LOT OF COMMERCIAL EXPERIENCE THAT I DON'T HAVE 
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY THAT I'M BLAMING CLAIRE I JUST FEEL THAT CLAIRE 
YOU BROUGHT HER BACK INTO THE BOARDROOM 
YES THE REASON I BROUGHT HER IN IS I FEEL THAT WITH HER EXPERIENCE SHE COULD HAVE AT THE EARLIER STAGE 
RECOGNISED THAT THE PRODUCT THAT WE WERE SELLING MAY NOT BE 
GOOD FOR THE MARKET PLACE 
JENNY IS THE ONE THAT INNOVATED IT AND IF YOU WANT MY OPINION I WOULD HAVE QUITE UNDERSTOOD 
HER SITTING THERE BETTER THAN CLAIRE QUITE FRANKLY 
CLAIRE I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU AS THE MOST QUALIFIED I THINK 
IN THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT DIDN'T STEP UP AND JUST TAKE OVER 
I ALSO DON'T UNDERSTAND PLACING THE BLAME WITH SARA 
MY ONLY COMMENT IS THAT FOR THE LAST THREE TASKS SARA 
AFTER THE TASK HAS SAID I HAD A GREAT IDEA BUT I WASN'T ALLOWED TO VOCALISE IT 
CAN I JUST ASK YOU ONE QUESTION 
DO YOU FEEL WE FAILED THIS TASK NOT BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN IDEA OF THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T SELL 
THESE CARDS NOT BECAUSE OF THE PITCH BUT BECAUSE I WAS WORKING ON A DAY WHERE YOU WEREN'T EVEN 
O. K. THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING IS WHAT IS THE REASON FOR LOSING THE TASK 
WAS IT THE PITCH THE POOR PITCH YOU GAVE TO THE RETAILERS 
OR IS IT THE BAD IDEA IT'S THE BAD IDEA SIR ALAN I TRULY BELIEVE 
THEREFORE WHY HAVE YOU SAID SHE SHOULD BE FIRED IN THIS TASK 
BECAUSE SARA SAYS THAT SHE'S COME UP WITH SOME VERY GOOD IDEAS SIR ALAN 
THAT SHE DIDN'T EVER RAISE WITH ME AT ANY POINT IN TIME 
YOU'VE ANSWERED MY QUESTION A LONG TIME AGO AND I'LL PUT THE SAME QUESTION TO YOU CLAIRE 
I BELIEVE WE FAILED THE TASK BECAUSE THE THEME WAS WRONG 
SO WHY'S JENNY NOT IN THIS ROOM I'VE GOT NO IDEA KEVIN 
VERY HARD ON A POOR IDEA 
VERY HARD SHE RAILROADED YOU INTO DOING THIS 
SHE DIDN'T RAILROAD ME SHE DID I THINK SHE RAN THIS BLOODY TASK 
NO SHE DIDN'T SIR ALAN BECAUSE I HAD COMPLETE CONTROL OF MY TEAM 
SHE DID CERTAINLY NOT RAILROAD ME INTO ANYTHING 
WE AS A TEAM DECIDED THE THEME 
KEVIN YOU'RE SINKING IN MY EYES YOUNG MAN 
TELL ME IN LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND WORDS WHY I SHOULDN'T FIRE YOU 
YOU WILL NOT GET ANY MORE HARD WORKING SELF DETERMINED LOYAL PERSON THAN ME 
AND I WOULD LOVE YOU TO GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW YOU ONE MORE TIME 
I'VE GIVEN YOU THE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS TASK AND IT WAS A BLOODY MESS AND I'VE MADE A MISTAKE 
SARA I HAVE A WORRY I DO HAVE A WORRY 
ALL I'VE SEEN YOU DO IS MOAN 
CLAIRE WE'VE HAD OUR RUN INS BEFORE IN THIS BOARDROOM 
IT IS REGRETFUL THAT WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED IN THE PAST SIX WEEKS DOES HELP YOU IN THE FUTURE 
IN PARTICULAR PERHAPS STEPPING UP AND TAKING OVER WHERE YOU ARE MORE EXPERT 
HOWEVER KEVIN THIS WHOLE TASK TURNED OUT 
A FIASCO AND AS TEAM LEADER I HOLD YOU TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE 
KEVIN YOU'RE FIRED 
OFF YOU GO BACK TO THE HOUSE AND I'LL SEE YOU ON THE NEXT TASK 
IT IS A BIG ISSUE BUT IT'S NOT MARKETABLE THAT'S WHERE THEY MADE THEIR MISTAKE 
I THINK HE TALKED HIMSELF INTO HIS DEPARTURE TO BE QUITE FRANK 
IT'S A MASSIVE BLOW AND I FEEL QUITE ANGRY THAT THERE'S PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE 
THAT I FEEL SHOULD NOT BE THERE 
AND TONIGHT I TRULY BELIEVE THAT SARA SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED 
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW 
WHO'S COMING BACK KEVIN WOULD BE THE ONE I WOULD FIRE 
AND NOT SARA NO WAY MATE 
TOLD YOU HOW ARE YOU 
OH MY GOD IS THAT IT 
FUCKING HELL WOULD YOU GET OUT THE FUCKING BOARDROOM 
KEVIN DID GET HIMSELF IN CIRCLES AND TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST I THINK HIS ARROGANCE COST HIM HIS PLACE 
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT KEVIN SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED THIS EVENING 
IT'S A COMPLETE AND UTTER TRAVESTY AND I THINK THAT SIR ALAN'S MADE THE WRONG DECISION IN MY OPINION 
IF I'M PROJECT MANAGER NEXT TIME AND I'VE GOT TO MANAGE PEOPLE LIKE SARA I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I'M MANAGING 
IF FOUR PEOPLE OUT OF FIVE THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T CONTRIBUTE HOW ARE YOU SITTING THERE WE WORKED AS A TEAM 
I DID GET INVOLVED IN THE MARKET RESEARCH SIDE OF THINGS 
THE FACTS ARE THIS IF YOU DON'T PERFORM YOU'RE OUT SIMPLE AS THAT 
AND IF YOU DON'T STEP UP TO THE MARK YOU'RE GOING IN THE BOARDROOM 
SIMPLE AS THAT END OF STORY 
THIS IS A RELIVING OF THE BOARDROOM YOU DON'T NEED TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS 
A DECISION HAS BEEN MADE SIR ALAN HAS MADE IT 
WE DO NOT NEED TO FIRE QUESTIONS AT HER AS TO WHAT SHE DID AND WHAT SHE DIDN'T DO RAEF IT'S MY OPINION 
IF I WANT TO ASK MY OPINION I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD ASK 
DID SARA'S LACK OF CONTRIBUTION MEAN YOU FAILED THE TASK NO IT DIDN'T 
OH RIGHT SO IN FUTURE 
I'LL TAKE THE LOW RISK OPTION THE EASY OPTION THAT WOULD GUARANTEE THAT I CAN 
NOT WORK AS A TEAM MEMBER AND I CAN JUST SAY I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TINY PROPORTION 
IT IS ALL ABOUT DOING YOUR BIT AND DOING THE REST OF IT 
CLAIRE YOU'VE DONE WELL ENOUGH MAN 
ONE JOB NOW TEN CANDIDATES REMAIN 
SIR ALAN'S SEARCH FOR HIS APPRENTICE CONTINUES 
NEXT WEEK ON THE APPRENTICE GOOD MORNING 
SIR ALAN WOULD LIKE YOU TO PACK FOR A TWO DAY BUSINESS TRIP TO MOROCCO GUYS WE'RE GOING TO MOROCCO 
THE CANDIDATES HEAD TO MARRAKECH ARMED WITH AN EXOTIC SHOPPING LIST 
ALARM CLOCK YEAH WHERE TO GET CHICKEN 
THAT IS PRETTY SPOT ON 
TO BARTER WITH THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS ONE TIME SPECIAL PRICE 
FIFTY I ONLY HAVE FIFTY 
WHAT'S YOUR LOWEST MOHAMMED THIS IS FAR TOO MUCH FOR US 
YOU ARE NOT A BUSINESSMAN THERE 
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS 
ARE YOU HAVING A LAUGH OR WHAT YOU'RE FIRED
