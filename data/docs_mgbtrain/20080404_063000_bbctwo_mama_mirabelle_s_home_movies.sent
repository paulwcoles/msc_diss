THERE CAN'T BE ANYWHERE HOTTER THAN HERE 
SO MANY QUESTIONS FOR SUCH A HOT DAY

SO SWING SWOOP 
SWAGGER OR CRAWL 
TO MAMA MIRABELLE'S BIG HOME MOVIE SHOW 
FIREFLIES LIGHT IT UP 
NOW IT'S TIME TO COOL OFF WITH HOT AND COLD RUNNING CREATURES 
THE SAVANNAH IS HOT 
BUT SOME PLACES ARE EVEN HOTTER LIKE THE DESERT 
WOW A SNAKE 
YES THAT'S A SIDEWINDER HE SLIDES ALONG LIKE THAT 
TO STOP BURNING HIS TUMMY ON THE HOT SAND HE'S FAST 
WELL HE HAS TO BE THAT SAND IS HOT 
IF IT GETS TOO HOT STAN JUST BURIES HIMSELF 
GETTING DOWN TO WHERE THE SAND IS COOLER AND HE'S OUT OF THE SUN 
SEE YOU STAN 
OUCH OUCH OUCH 
I THINK THAT SAND MUST BE HOT ON THOSE TINY TOES OF HIS 
HEY SHE LOOKS LIKE BO 
LIONS STAY COOL BY NAPPING THROUGH THE HOTTEST PART OF THE DAY AND 
THEY'RE PANTING LIKE ME 
PANTING ISN'T THE ONLY WAY TO COOL DOWN 
YOU CAN GO UNDERGROUND LIKE THIS TORTOISE 
AND SOME ANIMALS LIKE THIS MUSK OX 
WILL LOSE THEIR HEAVY COAT OF FUR IN THE WARMER MONTHS 
THIS IS CALLED SHEDDING 
I WISH I COULD DO THAT 
OTHER ANIMALS WAIT TO COME OUT AT NIGHT WHEN IT'S COOLER 
LIKE THIS BUSHBABY 
OH CUTE 
OH LOOK AT THAT OWL WOO OOH 
THE OWL WOO OOH 
VERY FUNNY 
HEY HIPPOS LIKE MUD TOO 
THAT'S RIGHT 
A LOT OF ANIMALS USE MUD AS A WAY TO COOL THEMSELVES DOWN ON A HOT DAY 
OH WARTHOGS WALLOWING IN THE MUD 
AND EVEN BETTER THAN MUD THERE'S WATER 
WHICH IS THE WAY MOST ANIMALS KEEP COOL 
EITHER BY BATHING IN IT LIKE THIS YELLOW WARBLER 
LAYING IN IT LIKE THIS FROG 
OR BEST OF ALL DRINKING IT 
IT'S SOMETHING WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON 
WE ALL NEED TO DRINK A LOT OF WATER 
AND IT'S A GREAT WAY TO COOL DOWN 
SO WHAT OH 
OH THAT MADE ME THIRSTY 
ME TOO 
OH THERE YOU ARE 
HEY MAMA WE SAW THE HOT CREATURES SHOULDN'T WE SEE THE COLD ONES TOO 
YOU ARE RIGHT AS RAIN KARLA 
RAIN WOULD BE NICE 
I CAN DO EVEN BETTER THAN RAIN LITTLE ONES HOW ABOUT SNOW 
SNOW NO 
YES WE LIVE WHERE IT'S WARM MOST OF THE TIME 
BUT THERE ARE ANIMALS WHO LIVE WHERE IT'S COLD MOST OF THE TIME 
WHERE THEY HAVE TO WORK TO STAY WARM SHALL WE WATCH MORE YES 
REMEMBER OUR FRIEND THE MUSK OX 
LOOK HIS COAT ISN'T FALLING OFF ANY MORE 
THAT'S RIGHT IT GROWS BACK FOR THE COLDER MONTHS 
A POLAR BEAR 
LOOK HOW WHITE HE IS 
AND HE HAS TWO KINDS OF FUR 
REALLY WHY 
WELL ONE TO KEEP HIS BODY HEAT CLOSE TO HIS SKIN 
AND THE OTHER TO GET THE HEAT FROM THE SUN 
BRR R. R. DO BEARS LIKE WINTER 
WELL NOT ALL OF THEM IN FACT SOME BEARS SLEEP ALL WINTER 
IT'S CALLED HIBERNATING 
THAT'S HOW THEY DEAL WITH THE COLD 
BUT POLAR BEARS LOVE WINTER 
THE RING SEAL DOESN'T HAVE AS THICK A COAT AS THE OTHERS 
BUT THERE'S A LAYER OF FAT UNDER HIS SKIN CALLED BLUBBER 
WHICH KEEPS HIM WARM HE DOESN'T LOOK COLD 
NOW THAT LOOKS COLD 
YES BUT JUST LIKE THE RING SEAL 
THE WALRUS AND HIS FAMILY HAVE A LAYER OF FAT 
TO KEEP THEM FEELING NICE AND WARM 
SOME ANIMALS WHO LIVE IN COLD WEATHER DON'T HAVE FUR 
I KNOW THOSE EMPEROR PENGUINS 
BUT PENGUINS DON'T HAVE FUR YOU'RE RIGHT 
THESE EMPEROR PENGUINS HAVE A WARM LAYER OF FAT UNDER THEIR SKIN 
LIKE WALRUSES AND SEALS THESE PENGUINS AREN'T FULLY GROWN 
SO WHEN IT'S REALLY COLD THEY HUDDLE TOGETHER TO KEEP WARM 
AND THEY HAVE FEATHERS TOO 
THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE FEATHERS I KNOW BUT THEY DO 
THOSE FEATHERS KEEP WATER OUT AND WARMTH IN 
COOL 
YES IT IS COOL 
WHAT'S SO FUNNY 
OH I GET IT 
LOOK AT THEM WADDLE 
LET'S ALL WADDLE LIKE PENGUINS ON ICE COME ON 
WADDLE WADDLE WADDLE 
HEY LOOK THE SUN'S GOING DOWN 
YES I FORGOT I WAS HOT 
WELL THAT'S ANOTHER LITTLE TRICK I'VE LEARNED FOR STAYING COOL 
IF YOU THINK COOL THOUGHTS OR WATCH A COOL MOVIE YOU FEEL A BIT COOLER 
YES NICE ONE MAMA 
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
NOW THAT THE SUN'S GOING DOWN IT REALLY IS COOLER 
YES AND WE CAN PLAY NOW 
RACE YOU TO THE TOP OF THE BIG HILL 
THANKS FOR THE COOL MOVIE MAMA 
WHAT'S THE MATTER BO DON'T YOU WANT TO PLAY 
WELL IT'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT COLD 
GOOD THING YOU'VE GOT YOUR WARM COAT STAY WARM
