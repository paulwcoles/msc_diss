AMERICA NINETEEN FIFTY NINE 
A NEW PRODUCT IS BEING MASS PRODUCED FOR THE AMERICAN MARKET MARGARINE 
THE PUBLIC HATED IT MARGARINE WAS CREATED IN A LABORATORY 
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH NATURAL BUTTER 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE AD MAN AUDACIOUS ENOUGH TO SELL THIS UNLOVED PRODUCT 
DAVID OGILVY HE WOULD NEED A TRULY EXTRAORDINARY ENDORSEMENT 
HE HAD A SALESMAN'S BACKGROUND 
HE WAS A SALESMAN 
AND HE WANTED TO GIVE YOU A REASON TO BUY WHAT HE WAS SELLING 
SO OGILVY CALLED THE WHITE HOUSE OR THE NEXT BEST THING 
HE DIALLED THE WIDOW OF ONE OF AMERICA'S GREATEST PRESIDENTS 
YEARS AGO MOST PEOPLE NEVER DREAMED OF EATING MARGARINE BUT TIMES HAVE CHANGED 
NOWADAYS YOU CAN GET A MARGARINE LIKE GOOD LUCK 
WHICH REALLY TASTES DELICIOUS 
THAT'S WHAT I SPREAD ON MY TOAST 
GOOD LUCK I THOROUGHLY ENJOY IT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW DAVID COULD GET MRS. ROOSEVELT TO COME 
AND GIVE A TESTIMONIAL ON MARGARINE I MEAN CAN YOU IMAGINE 
MONEY 
I PAID HER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND PERSUADED HER TO DO IT 
HE HAD THE ENTIRE PACKAGE 
THE LOOK THE SOUND THE ACCENT THE CONFIDENCE 
I'M NOT ASHAMED OF THAT EPISODE BECAUSE I BLIGHTED MRS. ROOSEVELT'S ESSENTIAL INNOCENCE 
SO YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER HE WAS THE PERFECT ADVERTISING MAN 
BUT SHE SO LOVED MARGARINE AND SHE WAS VERY SWEET ABOUT IT 
THIS IS THE UNLIKELY STORY OF HOW DAVID OGILVY DOOR TO DOOR SALESMAN POLLSTER CHEF AND AMISH FARMER 
TURNED HIMSELF INTO AN AD MAN EXTRAORDINAIRE 
HE WAS TO ADVERTISING WHAT CARY GRANT WAS TO FILM 
IF YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT ME 
YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT A LOT OF CONTRADICTORY CONFLICTING OPINIONS 
THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL TRUE PROBABLY ALL VALID 
OGILVY WAS A REVOLUTIONARY WHO WROTE THE RULEBOOK OF MODERN ADVERTISING 
HE HAD A CERTAIN WAY OF TYPEFACE AND A CERTAIN WAY OF WRITING 
AND A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WORDS IN THE FIRST SENTENCE BUT IT WORKED 
AND FOUNDED ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST SUCCESSFUL AD AGENCIES OGILVY AND MATHER 
WHEN DAVID OGILVY ARRIVED IN NEW YORK IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT 
POST WAR AMERICA WAS BURSTING WITH A NEW CONFIDENCE 
THE ECONOMY WAS BOOMING DRIVEN BY THE NEWLY AFFLUENT MIDDLE CLASS 
NEW PRODUCTS NEEDED NEW ADS AND MADISON AVENUE 
HOME OF THE HOTTEST AGENCIES WAS ENTERING ITS HEYDAY 
ADVERTISING WAS DRIVEN BY A BELIEF IN SCIENCE AND PROGRESS 
A BRAVE NEW WORLD OF CONSUMPTION AND CONFORMITY 
WITHIN TWO DECADES OGILVY WOULD REVOLUTIONISE ALL THIS 
INTRODUCING FLAIR AND STYLE INTO A GREY INDUSTRY 
AND TURNING HIMSELF INTO A BRAND THE FIRST CELEBRITY AD MAN 
THE MAN WHO WOULD DINE AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND BE KNIGHTED BY THE QUEEN 
COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN A LESS LIKELY CONTENDER 
OGILVY WAS BORN INTO GENTEEL POVERTY NEAR LONDON IN NINETEEN ELEVEN 
HE GREW UP A SCARED LITTLE BOY FEELING INADEQUATE AND YOU SEE THIS IN SO MANY SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE 
IT FUELS THE AMBITION TO SHOW 'EM AND FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES 
THEY'RE TRYING TO SHOW THOSE PEOPLE THAT DAMN IT I CAN DO THIS 
I CAN BE GOOD AT SOMETHING I CAN IMPRESS YOU 
HIS HOME LIFE WAS BLEAK 
OGILVY'S FATHER WAS HAUNTED BY HIS FINANCIAL FAILURES 
DID DAVID'S FATHERS FAILURE AS A BUSINESSMAN GIVE DAVID AMBITION 
PROBABLY CERTAINLY 
CERTAINLY IF YOU HAVE TO LIVE WEARING THE OLD CLOTHES OF YOUR BROTHER BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD THIS 
AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD THAT YOU PROBABLY BECOME AMBITIOUS 
OGILVY'S PARENTS WERE LOCKED IN A LOVELESS MARRIAGE 
HIS MOTHER WAS AN ECCENTRIC BEAUTIFUL AND DOMINEERING IRISHWOMAN 
FROM HER OGILVY INHERITED RESTLESSNESS AND DISSATISFACTION 
HIS MOTHER WAS A VERY HIGH STRUNG WOMAN VERY INTELLIGENT 
SHE HAD WANTED TO BECOME A DOCTOR 
AND IN THOSE DAYS WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED A WOMAN WAS THERE TO BE A WIFE AND BE A MOTHER 
SHE WAS NOT CONTENT WITH HER LOT IN LIFE 
IF OGILVY WAS UNHAPPY AT HOME HE WOULD BE EVEN MORE MISERABLE 
WHEN HE WAS PACKED OFF TO BOARDING SCHOOL AGED EIGHT 
THE BOY NURSED HIMSELF TO SLEEP AT NIGHT SUCKLING ON NESTLE MILK THROUGH A HOLE IN THE TIN 
SO HERE'S POOR DAVID SENT OFF TO BOARDING SCHOOL 
IN THAT HEARTLESS BRITISH MANNER THAT IS NOW HARD TO CONCEIVE 
HE'S EIGHT AND HE'S BEEN SENT OFF TO BOARDING SCHOOL 
WHERE THINGS ARE VERY HARD AND THERE WERE BULLIES 
AND I WAS AWFULLY WEAK BECAUSE I WAS A MOLLYCODDLED MILKSOP 
A CISSY MY SISTER MARY COULD BEAT ME AT EVERYTHING WRESTLING 
EVERY GAME CLIMBING TREES AND I GREW UP TO THINK I WAS A BOOB 
AS HE REMEMBERED IT HIS CHILDHOOD WAS PRETTY GRIM BUT IT FUELS HIM FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE 
HE WANTS TO SHOW THOSE PEOPLE 
THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE OGILVY KEPT HIS SCHOOL REPORT CARDS AS A CONSTANT REMINDER MUST DO BETTER 
I CAME TO KNOW THAT I'D NEVER BEEN SUCH A STUPID LITTLE IDIOT AS I'D ALWAYS BELIEVED 
NO YOU WERE JUST INTUITIVE 
HOW DARE YOU I DIDN'T JUST DO IT I DISCOVERED THE TRUTH 
I GOT OUT SOME OLD REPORT CARDS FROM MY SCHOOL WHEN I WAS NINE OR TEN 
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE I WAS AWFULLY DUMB 
BUT I SEE NOW READING THEM THESE WERE REPORTS FROM A VERY REMARKABLE CHILD 
OGILVY WAS SMART ENOUGH TO WIN A FULL SCHOLARSHIP TO OXFORD 
BUT HE WAS A SLOPPY STUDENT AND WAS THROWN OUT IN NINETEEN THIRTY ONE 
AT THE HEIGHT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION 
I WAS TERRIBLY LAZY AT OXFORD 
I NEVER PASSED ANY EXAMS SO AFTER TWO YEARS THEY THREW ME OUT 
WHAT A DOPE I WAS TO LET THAT HAPPEN 
WITH AN ALMOST UNHEARD OF BRAVADO OGILVY RESISTED THE CONSTRAINTS 
OF A CONVENTIONAL CAREER PATH EMBARKING INSTEAD ON A SERIES OF MAD CAP ADVENTURES 
I'M A ROLLING STONE 
I'VE HAD ABOUT TEN CAREERS 
THEY WOULD PROVE TO BE THE SECRET OF HIS LATER SUCCESS 
EACH APPARENTLY RANDOM EPISODE WOULD TEACH OGILVY A LESSON 
THAT WOULD PROVE INVALUABLE ON MADISON AVENUE 
AS HE PUT IT ONCE I'VE ALWAYS CARRIED TOO MUCH SAIL 
I HAVE LACKED A DEEP KEEL 
AND THE QUALITY THAT HE CAUGHT THERE IS HIS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEW IDEAS 
NEW PERSONALITIES NEW SURROUNDINGS 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE NIMBLE IN ADVERTISING AND BE READY TO LAND ON YOUR FEET 
IT'S A QUALITY THAT HELPED HIM MOVE THROUGH VARIOUS PHASES IN ADVERTISING 
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE STUCK IN THE MUD 
YOU GOT TO HAVE ALL YOUR SENSES ALERT AND OPEN 
OGILVY'S FIRST BIG ADVENTURE AFTER LEAVING OXFORD 
WAS A JOB AS IN ONE OF FRANCE'S GREATEST KITCHENS AT THE MAJESTIC HOTEL 
IN THOSE KITCHENS EVERYTHING THAT LEFT THE KITCHEN TO GO OUT HAD TO BE PERFECT 
THE WAY THE PLATE LOOKED THE PRESENTATION THE TASTE EVERYTHING 
AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT MADE HIM A PERFECTIONIST 
OGILVY LEARNED HARD WORK EXCELLENCE AND DISCIPLINE 
AND THE HEAD CHEF PITARD TAUGHT OGILVY A STYLE OF MANAGEMENT BASED ON RESPECT AND FEAR 
ONE TIME PITARD WAS WATCHING ME DECORATE FROGS' LEGS MOST EXQUISITE WORK 
IT WAS AN IMPORTANT DAY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE WAS COMING TO DINNER 
SUDDENLY PITARD WATCHING ME SIGNALLED FOR THE OTHER CHEFS TO COME OVER TO MY TABLE 
SON OF A BITCH I THOUGHT HE'S GOING TO FIRE ME AND HE WANTS AN AUDIENCE 
I KEPT GOING MY KNEES WERE KNOCKING TOGETHER LIKE CASTANETS 
THE WHOLE BRIGADE WAS GATHERED AROUND I WAS WORKING AWAY PITARD 
POINTED AT MY WORK AND SAID TO THE OTHERS THAT IS THE WAY TO DO IT 
IT WAS THE PROUDEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE 
A FEW HOURS LATER I SAW THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE EATING MY FROGS' LEGS 
THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE DIED 
A YEAR LATER THE RESTLESS TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD RETURNED TO BRITAIN 
FORSAKING PARISIAN ELEGANCE FOR A SALES JOB IN SCOTLAND 
HAWKING DOOR TO DOOR A NEW PRODUCT CALLED THE AGA COOKER 
ANOTHER COMPONENT OF HIS CREATIVE PHILOSOPHY 
CAME VERY MUCH FROM HIS EXPERIENCE SELLING AGA COOKERS 
WHERE HE SAID NO SALE NO COMMISSION 
NO COMMISSION NO EAT 
HERE IS A MODEL OF AN AGA 
IT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE COOKING STOVE IN THE WORLD 
AND BY FAR THE BEST 
IT USED TO MAKE ME HALF AN HOUR TO MAKE THE SALE 
THAT'S ABOUT THREE THOUSAND WORDS 
IT WAS A LESSON OF HUMILITY COS YOU HAVE TO KNOCK AT THE DOOR OF SOMEONE 
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PRAISE THE PRODUCT YOU ARE SELLING 
AND THEN HE KNEW HOW TO COOK SO HE SHOWED WHAT ONE CAN DO WITH IT 
OGILVY WAS A NATURAL SALESMAN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT AGA ASKED HIM TO WRITE THE SALES MANUAL 
FORTUNE MAGAZINE SAID IT IS THE BEST OF ITS KIND EVER WRITTEN 
THE LONGER YOU TALK TO A PROSPECT THE BETTER 
AND YOU WILL NOT DO THIS IF YOU ARE A BORE 
PEPPER YOUR TALK WITH ANECDOTES AND JOKES 
A DEADLY SERIOUS DEMONSTRATION IS BOUND TO FAIL 
IF YOU CANNOT MAKE A LADY LAUGH YOU CERTAINLY CANNOT MAKE HER BUY 
WRITING HIS FIRST AD FOR THE AGA WHETTED OGILVY'S APPETITE FOR ADVERTISING 
HE PAID PEOPLE THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENT 
DON'T TALK DOWN TO THEM 
DON'T PRETEND THAT OR EVEN THINK YOU KNOW ANY MORE THAN THEY DO 
I MEAN THAT WAS WHAT DAVID OGILVY WAS ABOUT 
HE COULD TALK TO PEOPLE IN A LANGUAGE THAT THEY COULD UNDERSTAND 
A CONSUMER IS NOT A MORON SHE'S YOUR WIFE DON'T INSULT HER INTELLIGENCE AND DON'T SHOCK HER 
A LOT OF CONSUMERS ARE NOT AS SOPHISTICATED AS YOU ARE 
WITH SCOTLAND CONQUERED OGILVY SET HIS SIGHTS ON AMERICA 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT HE BEGAN TO WORK AT GEORGE GALLUP'S GRANDLY NAMED AUDIENCE RESEARCH INSTITUTE 
GALLUP TURNED POLLING INTO A SCIENCE AND WAS THE FIRST 
TO APPLY ITS TECHNIQUES TO THE WORLD OF ADVERTISING 
POUNDING THE STREETS FOR GALLUP MADE A LASTING IMPRESSION 
HE WENT DOOR TO DOOR AND HE ASKED PEOPLE THEIR OPINIONS 
AND WHY THEY THOUGHT WHAT THEY THOUGHT 
AND I THINK THAT TOO STAYED WITH HIM 
HE NEVER FOR A MINUTE STOPPED THINKING ABOUT 
WHAT DOES THE CONSUMER THINK 
OGILVY TOOK GALLUP'S WORK TO HOLLYWOOD 
HE BELIEVED IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHICH MOVIES WOULD BE HITS AND WHICH FILMS WOULD FLOP 
THIS PREDICTIVE RESEARCH SO UNNERVED TINSELTOWN'S STARS THAT OGILVY SOON BEGAN TO OUTSTAY HIS WELCOME 
HERE'S SOME OF MY REPORTS 
I WAS ABLE TO PREDICT HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD SEE A MOTION PICTURE BEFORE IT WAS FILMED 
WHO WAS A BANKABLE SCRIPTWRITER DIRECTOR ALL OF THESE THINGS 
AND THEY BASICALLY COULD SAY IF YOU GET X. Y. AND Z. 
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY ON A FILM ABOUT SUCH AND SUCH 
MY TIMES WITH PEOPLE LIKE DAVID SELZNICK AND SAM GOLDWYN 
I GOT TO MEET A LOT OF THE MOVIE STARS AND THE GREAT DIRECTORS AND SO ON 
AND I RUINED SOME OF THE STARS BY REVEALING 
THAT THEY WERE NOT SO POPULAR WITH THE PUBLIC AS STUDIOS BELIEVED 
HE WAS SORT OF PUSHED OUT OF HOLLYWOOD AS MY UNDERSTANDING IS 
BECAUSE THEY SOME OF THESE STARS REALISED 
THAT THEY WOULD NOT RISE TO THE TOP BY DOING IT IN A WAY OF POLLING 
AND SO THEY STOPPED IT 
AT THE END OF WORLD WAR TWO 
OGILVY TURNED HIS BACK ON HIS NEW INTEREST IN ADVERTISING AND THE MODERN WORLD 
HE RETREATED TO THE AMISH COMMUNITY IN PENNSYLVANIA DREAMING OF A PERFECT LIFE AS A FARMER 
IT'S A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FROM THE LIFE THAT HE HAD LED UP TO THAT POINT 
HE GROWS THE BEARD HE'S FARMING TOBACCO ON ONE HUNDRED ACRES 
THERE'S A TROUT STREAM ROLLING THROUGH THE MEADOW 
ALL MY NEIGHBOURS WERE AMISH 
THEY PLOUGH WITH HORSES INSTEAD OF TRACTORS 
THEY USE CANDLES INSTEAD OF ELECTRIC LIGHT 
THEY DON'T HAVE TELEVISION OR RADIO 
I THOUGHT THEIR WAY OF LIFE WAS HAPPIER THAN OURS AND I STILL THINK SO 
BUT AS A FARMER I WAS A FLOP 
EVEN HERE OGILVY WOULD LEARN A VALUABLE LESSON ROMANCE AND IDEALISM 
HE FAILED AS A FARMER HE COULDN'T MAKE A GO AT IT NOW HE DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH FOR IT 
PROBABLY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT ANIMAL HUSBANDRY 
AND I THINK ALSO ON SOME LEVEL IT WAS NOT INTELLECTUALLY SATISFYING 
PARADOXICALLY IT WAS HERE ON THE FARM THAT THE IDEA OF FORGING A CAREER IN ADVERTISING TOOK HOLD 
I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED THAT THERE WEREN'T SOME ADVERTISING BOOKS TUCKED AWAY IN HIS SUITCASE 
THAT HE STARTED STUDYING EVERY EVENING IN CANDLELIGHT 
I'M SURE HE DID 
SO IT WAS A FUNNY COMBINATION 
OGILVY SHAVED OFF HIS BEARD AND ARRIVED ON MADISON AVENUE IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT 
AT THE START OF THE BIGGEST CONSUMER BOOM IN AMERICAN HISTORY 
SO HE GOES FROM THIS ANTI MODERN CULTURE 
TO THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC EXPRESSION OF MODERNITY IN THE BUSINESS WORLD 
WHAT IS MORE MODERN THAN ADVERTISING 
HE WAS ALMOST FORTY WITH LITTLE EXPERIENCE 
OGILVY APPEARED TO BE A DANDY DILETTANTE HIS AMBITIONS YET ANOTHER ROMANTIC DREAM 
THIS EXTRAORDINARILY MESSY C. V. 
NO ONE WOULD HAVE RECRUITED SOMEONE WITH THAT C. V. AT THE AGE OF THIRTY EIGHT 
WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE ABSOLUTE SORT OF FLITTER MATERIAL 
YOU KNOW A QUITTER NOT A STAYER 
SINCE NO ONE WOULD HIRE HIM OGILVY HIRED HIMSELF AND SET UP HIS OWN AGENCY JUST OFF MADISON AVENUE 
IT WAS DAVID AGAINST GOLIATH 
THE NEW BOSS WROTE A MEMO TO HIS SMALL STAFF 
THE EARLY YEARS WERE NOT GOING TO BE EASY OGILVY WARNED 
I SAID THIS IS A NEW AGENCY STRUGGLING FOR ITS LIFE 
IN HIRING THE EMPHASIS WILL BE ON YOUTH 
WE ARE LOOKING FOR A YOUNG TURKS 
I'VE NO USE FOR TOADIES OR HACKS 
I SEEK GENTLEMEN WITH BRAINS 
OGILVY DID PROMISE THAT THEY WOULD BE A GREAT AGENCY BY NINETEEN SIXTY 
AT THE END OF THE MEMO HE ATTACHED A LIST OF THE FIVE WORLD FAMOUS COMPANIES HE WANTED AS CLIENTS 
AD MEN OF THIS ERA WERE ALREADY KNOWN AS MAD MEN IN HOMAGE TO MADISON AVENUE 
BUT OGILVY'S AMBITIONS SEEMED SIMPLY INSANE 
IN THE FORTIES FRANK SINATRA KEPT A LIST IN HIS DRESSING ROOM 
OF ALL THE STARS IN MOVIES THAT HE WANTED TO SLEEP WITH 
OGILVY BEING A MUCH SMARTER MAN JUST KEPT A LIST OF THE FIVE ACCOUNTS HE WANTED TO GET 
SHELL 
LEVER BROTHERS 
CAMPBELL'S SOUP GENERAL FOODS AND BRISTOL MYERS 
HE HAD A LIST WHICH I SAW AS A YOUNG PERSON 
DIDN'T REALLY REALISE THE IMPACT OF IT HE SAID THESE ARE THE CLIENTS I'D LIKE TO WORK FOR 
AND THEY WERE ALL SUPER CLIENTS THAT HE HAD NO POSSIBILITY WITH 
HE WAS IN A TINY LITTLE OFFICE NOBODY HAD EVER HEARD OF HIM 
OGILVY WAS COMPETING AGAINST A DOZEN OR SO LARGE 
ESTABLISHED AGENCIES THAT HAD SURVIVED THE GREAT DEPRESSION 
THE ETHOS OF ADVERTISING WAS HARD SELL 
FIRST RESEARCH ESTABLISHED WHAT THE BENEFIT THE U. S. P. UNIQUE SELLING POINT OF A PRODUCT WAS 
THEN ADS WERE PLACED IN MAGAZINES AND NEWSPAPERS OR ON THE EMBRYONIC MEDIUM OF TELEVISION 
IN THEM THE U. S. P. WAS REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN RELENTLESSLY 
A FRIEND OF OGILVY'S THE COPYWRITER ROSSER REEVES WAS A PASSIONATE APOSTLE OF THIS SCHOOL OF SELLING 
HE USED TO ILLUSTRATE IT BY SAYING A MAN GOES INTO HIS BARN WITH A HAMMER 
AND HE HAS A DONKEY IN THE BARN 
AND HE WANTS TO TELL THE DONKEY WHAT TO DO 
SO THE FIRST THING HE DOES HE WHACKS THE DONKEY ON THE HEAD WITH A HAMMER 
AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY WHY DID HE DO THAT MR. REEVES 
AND ROSSER REEVES WOULD SAY TO GET HIS ATTENTION 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN ADVERTISING 
OGILVY'S STYLE WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND DISTINCTLY SOFT SELL 
HARD FACTS REPLACED BY AN IMAGE THE EMPHASIS ON MOOD STYLE AND COLOUR 
FOR AN EARLY CLIENT GUINNESS 
AT THE TIME A LITTLE KNOWN DRINK IN AMERICA 
OGILVY CREATED A CAMPAIGN AS ECCENTRIC AND WHIMSICAL AS HE WAS 
ROSSER REEVES WOULD SAY OH HE'S QUAINT YOU KNOW 
IF YOU WANT TO SELL PRODUCT COME TO ME 
IF YOU WANNA BE TALKED TO BY SOME FANCY GUY WITH A FANCY ACCENT GO TO SEE DAVID 
OGILVY'S FANCY WAYS WORKED WELL ENOUGH ON ROSSER REEVES SISTER IN LAW MELINDA STREET 
SHE BECAME THE FIRST OF HIS THREE WIVES AND THEY HAD A SON TOGETHER ALSO CALLED DAVID 
BUT THE RELATIONSHIP HAD HAD A VERY ROCKY START 
HE WAS TOTALLY SMIT WITH HER AND SHE HATED HIM ON SIGHT 
SHE THOUGHT HE WAS SO POMPOUS AND STUCK UP AND BRITISH 
AND SO THE NEXT DAY HER ROOM WAS TOTALLY FULL OF ROSES 
IN FACT SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T EVEN GET IN THE DOOR 
AND SO FINALLY HE PREVAILED UPON HER TO HAVE ANOTHER DATE THREE DAYS LATER 
AND THE NEXT DAY THEY WENT OUT TO DINNER AND THE SEVENTH DAY THEY WERE ENGAGED 
DONE SO HE WAS A VERY GOOD SALESMAN 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE OGILVY CRAFTED THE CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD MAKE HIS NAME 
IT WAS A VERY UNLIKELY CLIENT HATHAWAY A SHIRT MAKERS' 
THAT HAD LANGUISHED IN OBSCURITY FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY 
I SAID HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU GOT TO SPEND HE SAID THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS 
I ALMOST BURST INTO TEARS BECAUSE FIFTEEN PER CENT COMMISSION ON THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULDN'T KEEP ANYBODY ALIVE FOR LONG 
ON A TINY BUDGET OGILVY SLAVED TO PREPARE EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT IDEAS 
FOR WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY A VERY DULL PRODUCT 
THEN INSPIRATION STRUCK 
AND ON THE WAY TO THE SHOOT DAVID WAS THINKING I'VE GOT TO FIND SOME WAY OF MAKING THIS POP THIS AD 
AND HE STOPPED OFF AT A CHEMIST AND BOUGHT AN EYE PATCH 
AND TOOK IT TO THE SHOOT AND STUCK IT ON TO WRANGLE 
AND THAT WAS IT 
THE HATHAWAY SHIRT CAMPAIGN IS SO DAVID BECAUSE 
HE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT BIG IDEAS AND A BURR OF SINGULARITY 
TRY AND INJECT INTO EVERY COMMERCIAL YOU MAKE 
A TOUCH OF SINGULARITY A BURR THAT WILL HOOK ON TO THE CONSUMER'S MIND 
YOU PUT AN EYE PATCH ON HIM AND SUDDENLY WHY IS THAT MAN WEARING AN EYE PATCH 
I WONDER HOW WHAT HAPPENED 
YOU KNOW DUELLING ACCIDENT 
AND SUDDENLY IT CHANGES THE WHOLE SENSE OF WHAT THE MAN IS LIKE 
AND YOU FIND YOURSELF LOOKING AT THE AD AND LOOKING AT THE SHIRT 
THIS CAMPAIGN'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL 
A RATHER UNIMPORTANT WAY TO GET FAMOUS ISN'T IT 
IT MADE ME FAMOUS AND IT MADE OUR CLIENTS FAMOUS AND PROVED OURSELVES 
THE AD CAMPAIGN RAN IN THE NEW YORKER MAGAZINE FOR NINETEEN YEARS 
AND SALES OF THE SHIRTS ROSE BY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PER CENT 
THERE WAS ONE STORY ABOUT THE HATHAWAY MAN A DISTINGUISHED RUSSIAN EMIGRE CALLED BARON WRANGEL 
THAT THE PUBLIC COULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED 
IN LATER YEARS HE REQUIRED ANOTHER PROP 
YOU HAD TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO SHOOT THE BARON BEFORE ELEVEN A M. 
BECAUSE HE HAD THE SHAKES AFTER THAT 
UNLESS YOU GAVE HIM GIN AND IF YOU GAVE HIM GIN HE JUST HAD MORE OF THE SHAKES 
SO WE USED TO HAVE AN APPARATUS RIGGED UP 
WHICH WOULD SUPPORT HIS ELBOWS AND HANDS BECAUSE IF NOT 
THE PHOTOGRAPHER WOULD GET CAMERA BLUR 
BECAUSE HIS HANDS WOULD BE WAGGLING SO MUCH BECAUSE HE COULDN'T WAIT FOR THAT FIRST QUICK ONE 
IN THE MORNING 
THE HATHAWAY MAN BECAME AN ICON 
OGILVY BEGAN WEARING HATHAWAY SHIRTS BEGINNING A LIFELONG HABIT 
OF USING PRODUCTS HE PROMOTED CO MINGLING HIMSELF WITH THE BRAND 
IN LATER ADS IT WAS EASY TO IMAGINE OGILVY IN THE GLAMOROUS SCENARIOS HE DREAMT UP FOR THE BARON 
THE ACTUAL ROLES THEY PUT HIM IN WERE ALL WALTER MITTY OGILVY 
THEY WERE SITUATIONS THAT HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE DOING LOOKING AT A FANCY SHOTGUN 
CONDUCTING THE PHILHARMONIC THINGS THAT HE IMAGINED HIMSELF DOING BUT DID NOT DO AND SO 
YOU CAN SEE THAT GUY IN THOSE ADS IS HIS ALTER EGO EXPRESSING ITSELF 
OGILVY MIGHT NOT HAVE SPORTED AN EYEPATCH BUT HIS BRITISHNESS WAS EQUALLY NOVEL ON MADISON AVENUE 
HE DELIBERATELY PLAYED UP TO IT WEARING TWEEDS SMOKING A PIPE 
AND TAKING TEA AT PRECISELY FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY EACH AFTERNOON 
OGILVY WAS TURNING HIMSELF INTO A PERSONALITY AND A BRAND THE FIRST ADVERTISING FIGURE TO DO SO 
HE HAD AN ACCENT AN ENGLISH ACCENT 
THAT IF HE READ THE TELEPHONE BOOK PEOPLE WOULD FOLLOW BECAUSE HE SOUNDED SO GOOD 
PERHAPS A BIT OF SELF ADVERTISEMENT YOU KNOW 
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS ON A WHITE TIE AND TAILS AND ONE MAN IN A KILT 
IF YOU CAN'T ADVERTISE YOURSELF 
WHAT HOPE HAVE YOU OF BEING ABLE TO ADVERTISE ANYTHING ELSE 
OGILVY HAD FOUND HIS BIG IDEA HIS BURR OF SINGULARITY HIMSELF 
BY BEING DIFFERENT BY BEING ENGLISH BY BEING EXTRAVAGANT 
BY BEING FLAMBOYANT BY BEING SUCH A HARD WORKER 
BY BEING VERY ORIGINAL HE CREATED A BRAND A NEW BRAND OF AN ADVERTISING MAN 
BY NINETEEN FIFTY TWO OGILVY'S AGENCY WAS WELL KNOWN IN ADLAND 
HE HAD ATTRACTED ANOTHER ENGLISH CLIENT A STRUGGLING MIXER DRINK CALLED SCHWEPPES 
HE CAST THE DRINK'S ODDBALL AD MANAGER COMMANDER EDWARD WHITEHEAD AS THE MAN FROM SCHWEPPES 
THE CAMPAIGN RAN FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS AND MADE A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO THE NEW MEDIUM TELEVISION 
NOW WAIT DON'T TELL ME WAS IT HONG KONG BERUIT 
CAIRO PERHAPS 
GUESS AGAIN COMMANDER WHITEHEAD 
LONDON IT WAS LONDON I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT 
YOU WERE HAVING A TONIC AND YOU WERE WARNING THE WAITER 
TO MAKE JOLLY WELL SURE HE MIXED IT WITH SCHWEPPES 
BUT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE 
SCHWEPPES QUININE WATER IS FAMOUS ALL OVER THE WORLD 
YOU USED TO SAY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE THE TONIC WITHOUT SCHWEPPES 
IT IS NO OTHER MIXER HAS SCHWEPPES' BITTERSWEET FLAVOUR AND RARE EFFERVESCENCE 
EFFERVESCENCE YOU USED TO CALL THOSE LITTLE BUBBLES SCHWEPPERVESCENCE 
SCHWEPPERVESCENCE OF COURSE 
THOSE REMARKABLE LITTLE BUBBLES THAT LAST THE WHOLE DRINK THROUGH 
DID YOU KNOW THAT SCHWEPPES QUININE WATER IS NOW BOTTLED HERE IN THE STATES 
FROM THE IMPORTED ELEXIR 
DO TELL ME 
WHERE DID WE MEET 
WAS IT PARIS 
IN ADDITION TO BRANDING HIMSELF OGILVY WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME IN RECOGNIZING THAT THE WAY TO BRAND 
PRODUCTS WAS TO INFUSE THEM WITH PERSONALITIES 
HE DECIDED TO INVENT THE MAN FROM SCHWEPPES 
HE'S COMING OFF A PLANE ON RED CARPET 
AND THEY SAY THE MAN FROM SCHWEPPES IS HERE 
AND SUDDENLY THIS GUY BECOMES PART OF OUR LANGUAGE PART OF OUR WORLD 
AND EVERYONE DECIDES THAT OH I CAN BE VERY SOPHISTICATED IF I ORDER YOU KNOW SCHWEPPES 
THAT'S BRILLIANT 
OGILVY WAS THE COMPANY AND THE BRAND 
IT WAS A REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL RECIPE 
BY THE MID FIFTIES IT WAS AMERICA'S FIFTY FIRST MOST PROFITABLE AGENCY 
WITH FORTY STAFF AND BILLINGS OF TEN POINT SEVEN DOLLARS M. A YEAR 
THEN IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE OGILVY LANDED LEVER BROTHERS THE FIRST OF HIS BIG FIVE COMPANIES 
AND HE WROTE ADS LIKE 
SUDDENLY I'M HEAD OVER HEELS IN DOVE 
I MEAN AWFUL HEADLINES BUT 
BUT THE ONE QUARTER CLEANSING CREAM THAT MAKES YOUR SKIN LOOK YOUNGER 
THAT WAS WRITTEN FIFTY SIXTY YEARS AGO IT'S STILL RUNNING 
DOVE IS COMPLETELY NEW REVOLUTIONARY 
MUCH BETTER FOR YOUR SKIN 
EVERY BAR OF DOVE IS ONE QUARTER CLEANSING CREAM 
DOVE IS THE NUMBER BAR OF SOAP IN THE WORLD IN DOLLAR SALES 
DOVE'S RICH LATHER CLEANS AND CREAMS YOUR SKIN AT THE SAME TIME 
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS STORY 
OGILVY AND AMP MATHER WAS HEADING FOR THE BIG LEAGUE 
OTHER NEW CLIENTS INCLUDED MATTEL ELECTRONICS AND CAMPBELL SOUPS 
THE AGENCY HAD BECOME KNOWN AS A CREATIVE HOT SHOP WITH OGILVY AS ITS RESIDENT GENIUS 
PUBLICLY OGILVY WOULD CLAIM THIS HIMSELF 
IT WAS OF COURSE ALL PART OF HIS BRANDING STRATEGY 
HE WAS CLEVER ENOUGH TO LAY CLAIM TO HIS OWN GENIUS AND HIS OWN CREATIVE 
ABILITIES SIMPLY BECAUSE CLIENTS ARE RARELY ATTRACTED TO BUSINESSES 
WHO SAY WE'RE JUST REALLY REALLY LUCKY 
AND HE SAID TO BE ABSOLUTELY HONEST THERE WAS A SIX OR SEVEN YEAR PERIOD 
WHERE ON MADISON AVENUE WE WERE JUST EXTRAORDINARILY FASHIONABLE 
WE WERE THE MOST FASHIONABLE PLACE IN TOWN 
YOU COULDN'T HOLD A NEW BUSINESS PITCH WITHOUT INCLUDING US 
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THAT HAPPENED AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW YOU COULD POSSIBLY RECREATE IT 
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT BIG IDEAS 
BIG IDEAS THAT'S WHAT THE ADVERTISING BUSINESS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT 
AD AGENCIES ARE GOOD AT RESEARCH AND POSITIONING DEFINING 
TARGET AUDIENCES AND SO ON BUT ARE INCAPABLE OF CREATIVE BRILLIANCE 
AS I SEE IT WE HAVE TO DO OUR HOMEWORK AND CREATE BRILLIANT CAMPAIGNS 
OGILVY WAS THE FIRST AD MAN TO PLACE SUCH A PREMIUM ON BIG IDEAS 
THE PROCESS FOR GENERATING HIS OWN WAS INTENSE AND GRUELLING 
MOST OF THE WRITING WAS DONE AT HOME THE RESULTS WERE REMARKABLE FOR OGILVY'S SUBSTITUTE CHILD 
HIS AGENCY BUT NOT SO GREAT FOR HIS REAL FAMILY 
HE WOULD COME FROM A LONG DAY AT WORK HE'D PUT IN TREMENDOUS HOURS 
HE'D ALWAYS HAVE TWO BRIEFCASES EVERY NIGHT 
AND HE WOULD JUST SIT AT HIS DESK UNTIL EVERY SINGLE PAPER WAS SEEN 
AT LEAST HE'S AT HOME WHEN HE'S DOING HIS COPYRIGHTING 
BUT EVEN THERE IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S AVAILABLE 
HE SAID HIMSELF THAT WHEN HE'S SITTING THERE TRYING TO SWEAT 
OUT SOME COPY IF HIS WIFE COMES INTO THE ROOM HE GROWLS AT HER 
HE WOULD HAVE A WHOLE WONDERFUL JAR OF PENCILS ALL SHARPENED 
PERFECTLY SHARPENED AND READY TO GO 
AND HE'D BE OFF WRITING AND HE WOULD JUST WRITE AND WRITE AND WRITE 
AND YOU COULD HEAR HIM IT'S 
HE WOULD JUST UNDERLINE AND CROSS OUT UNDERLINE AND CROSS OUT 
HE DEVELOPED VARIOUS WAYS OF WHAT HE CALLED KEEPING A TELEPHONE LINE OPEN TO HIS SUBCONSCIOUS 
IT WOULD BE THINGS LIKE GOING FOR A WALK IN THE WOODS WATCHING BIRDS 
GARDENING HE LOVED TO GARDEN 
THINGS LIKE THIS WHERE HE'S APPARENTLY NOT WORKING BUT ON SOME LEVEL HE'S STILL THINKING ABOUT IT 
AND SOME OF THE BEST STUFF COMES WHEN HE'S DOING THAT 
I ONCE DREAMED A BIG IDEA A WAGON WITH TWO WHITE HORSES 
DELIVERING PEPPERIDGE FARM BREAD 
THAT WAGON IS STILL BEING USED TODAY TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER HOWDEE MA'AM 
CAN'T STOP NOW GOT TO DELIVER MAGGIE RUDKIN'S NEW PEPPERIDGE FARM FROZEN PASTRIES 
FOR PEPPERIDGE FARM 
OGILVY MAY HAVE SUBCONSCIOUSLY DRAWN ON HIS EXPERIENCES WITH THE AMISH 
I HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE WORK HE DID FOR PEPPERIDGE FARM 
WHICH WAS JUST PACKAGED BREAD UNTIL DAVID GOT HIS HANDS ON IT 
AND CREATED TITUS MOODY 
YOU KNOW COMING AND DELIVERING THE BREAD IN A COVERED WAGON 
GOT AN EXTRA SPECIAL DELIVERY TO MAKE TODAY SOMETHING NEW MAGGIE RUDKIN COOKED UP FOR PEPPERIDGE FARM 
IT BROKE THROUGH ALL THE CLUTTER IN MAGAZINES AND ON TELEVISION 
THEY TASTE HOME BAKED COS YOU BAKE 'EM YOURSELF 
LIFE WITH THIS COMPLICATED CREATIVE WAS NO WALK IN THE PARK 
SO WE'D GO TO A RESTAURANT AND WE'D ORDER FOOD 
AND THERE WOULD BE MY MOTHER AND ME AND I WOULD BE SEVEN OR EIGHT OR NINE 
AND THE SERVICE WOULD BE SLOW OH MY HEAVENS 
WELL THAT USUALLY PRODUCED AN EXPLOSION OF SOME SORT 
AND I WOULD BE THERE THINKING OH I HOPE NOBODY'S LOOKING AT US 
AND THEN THE MAIN COURSE WOULD COME AND IF IT WASN'T GOOD SUDDENLY HE'D STAND UP AND SAY 
THIS IS THE WORST MEAL I'VE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE AND LEAVE JUST GO 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE HE WALKED OUT OF HIS FIRST MARRIAGE 
TO DAVID JR'S MOTHER JUST AS IF HE WAS WALKING OUT OF A RESTAURANT 
HE WAS MARRIED TO MY MOTHER FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS 
THEY WENT ON A HOUSE PARTY WEEKEND AND ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON HE LEFT WITH A DIFFERENT WOMAN 
I MEAN JUST FROM ONE TO THE NEXT JUST GONE BOOM 
AND SHE WAS A WOMAN WHO HAD A THREE YEAR OLD A TWO YEAR OLD AND A ONE YEAR OLD 
AND SHE FELL TOTALLY UNDER HIS SPELL 
YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST ONE OF THESE AGAIN ROMANTIC WONDERFUL EXCITING 
IT WASN'T SO HOT FOR MY MOTHER 
AND FOR ME BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HE DID 
HE WAS AN IMPULSIVE PERSON 
AND IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AT THE HEIGHT OF OGILVY'S FAME 
THE SECOND MRS. OGILVY APPEARED IN A T. V. DOCUMENTARY ABOUT HIM 
HIS SECOND WIFE IS SEEN ON SCREEN AS SAYING WHEN HE'S NICE 
HE'S VERY VERY NICE AND WHEN HE'S AWFUL HE'S JUST AWFUL 
WHEN HE'S GOOD HE'S VERY VERY GOOD AND WHEN HE'S BAD HE'S HORRID 
WELL THAT IRRITATED HIM HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT MUCH 
BUT IT WAS THERE FOR THE WORLD TO SEE AND I WOULD SAY THAT WAS VERY TRUE 
SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE WOMEN IN HIS LIFE THE WIVES IN HIS LIFE 
WORKED VERY HARD AT MAKING SURE HE WAS HAPPY 
AND IF HE WAS HAPPY HE WAS A PIECE OF CAKE TO DEAL WITH 
IF HE WAS NOT HAPPY IT WAS NOT FUN 
WELL THE THINGS HE IS HE IS MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE 
IT'S HEIGHTENED THINGS ARE HEIGHTENED IN HIM 
SOME THINGS ARE HEIGHTENED AND SOME THINGS ARE LOWER 
BUT NOTHING'S EVER WHAT YOU'D EXPECT 
BY THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES MADISON AVENUE LIKE HOLLYWOOD HAD BECOME AN IDEA AS MUCH AS A PHYSICAL PLACE 
MADISON AVENUE WAS ADVERTISING JUST AS TINSELTOWN WAS THE MOVIES 
BUT ADVERTISING WAS STILL SEEN AS A NECESSARY EVIL RATHER THAN A RESPECTABLE PROFESSION 
MAD MEN WORKED HARD AND PLAYED HARD DEALING WITH STRESS BY INDULGING IN LONG MARTINI LACED LUNCHES 
COPYWRITERS WERE PARODIED AS WORKAHOLICS WOMANISERS AND WASTRELS 
DAVID OGILVY CHANGED ALL THAT 
READING FROM ALL ADVERTISING PEOPLE OF THAT TIME THERE'S A DESPERATION 
A SLIGHT SOCIAL UNEASE THAT THE BUSINESS THEY'RE IN IS NOT ALTOGETHER RESPECTABLE 
THERE ARE FAMOUS BOOKS DON'T TELL MY MUM I WORK IN ADVERTISING 
SHE THINKS I PLAY THE PIANO IN THE LOCAL BROTHEL 
AND THEY'RE BOOKS WHICH ECHO THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WERE UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS 
ADVERTISING HAD REALLY UNTIL THEN BEEN THE BUSINESS OF HUCKSTERS 
AND SALESMEN AND SUDDENLY HE HAD ADDED ART OR CREATIVITY 
OR HAD BEGUN TO SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE IN THIS 
THAN JUST SELLING BUT THAT ACTUALLY YOU COULD ELEVATE IT IN SOME WAY 
OGILVY'S OWN EXPERIENCE GAVE HIM A LIFELONG RESPECT FOR CREATIVES 
UNLIKE OTHER ADVERTISING AGENCIES OGILVY SET OUT TO BUILD A HOME 
THAT WAS WELCOMING TO ASPIRING POETS AND AUTHORS 
BIG TALENTS WITH BIG IDEAS 
HE HIRED GREAT PEOPLE AND TREATED THEM PROPERLY 
THERE WAS ALWAYS A CERTAIN DIGNITY IN OGILVY 
THERE WAS NONE OF THIS SORT OF THESE HUMILIATION EXPERIENCES 
THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IN OTHER AGENCIES HE TREATED YOU LIKE A GENT 
HE WAS A GENT HIMSELF AND HE HIRED GENTS AS MUCH AS HE COULD 
IT COULD GET VERY TENSE 
I MEAN YOU WOULD GET HOME FROM WORK COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED BECAUSE OF THE SORT OF EMOTIONAL SPIRALS PEOPLE 
HAD GOT THEMSELVES INTO ABOUT A FISH FINGER OR A FROZEN PEA 
IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY HOW MUCH PASSION THESE SIMPLE THINGS WOULD EVOKE IN PEOPLE 
BUT WORKING FOR OGILVY WAS NO BED OF ROSES 
ALL OF US FELT THAT WE WERE WORKING 
IN THE BEST POSSIBLE AGENCY IN THE WHOLE WORLD 
WE ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF IT 
HOWEVER WE WERE NERVOUS ALL THE TIME TOO BECAUSE 
COPYWRITERS WERE VERY ERM 
LIKELY TO BE FIRED 
IF YOU DIDN'T REALLY MEASURE UP YOU WERE GONE YOU WERE GONE INSTANTLY 
OGILVY INFLICTED HIS HIGH STANDARDS ON HIS STAFF REGARDLESS OF THE TIME OR PLACE 
THE SECRETARY SAID YOU MUST GO THROUGH HE'S EXPECTING YOU 
NO SIGN OF OGILVY AT ALL 
AND I THOUGHT I MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE AND I WAS JUST ABOUT 
TO BACK OUT AND ASK WHAT TO DO NEXT AND THIS VOICE CAME FROM THE CORNER SAYING I AM AT STOOL 
I LOOKED AROUND AND THERE WAS A DOOR IN THE CORNER 
AND THE VOICE SAID 
SLIDE YOUR COPY UNDER THE DOOR 
SO I WENT UP TO THE DOOR AND IT WAS THIS LAVATORY 
I SLID MY COPY UNDER THE DOOR 
SORT OF STOOD THERE AT ATTENTION FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES 
COPY CAME SLIDING BACK OUT AGAIN 
AND HE SAID OFF YOU GO AND THAT WAS THAT I WENT OFF 
AND I HAD A LOOK AT WHAT HE'D WRITTEN AND OF COURSE HE'D SEIZED ON ALL THE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT WERE WITTY AND 
WONDERFUL AND JUST PUT RED PENCIL THROUGH IT AND SAID QUACK QUACK 
OMIT OR YOU KNOW MUST TRY HARDER 
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE GREATEST WRITERS IN THE WORLD THEIR BOOKS ARE 
COMPLETELY DEPENDENT UPON THEIR EDITORS THEIR PUBLISHING HOUSE 
YOU CAN'T JUDGE YOUR OWN WORK 
HE USED TO ALWAYS WRITE BELLES LETTRES 
HE DIDN'T LIKE BELLES LETTRES IN ADVERTISING HE SAID WE'RE NOT HERE TO ENTERTAIN OR AMUSE 
WE'RE HERE TO SELL NEVER FORGET THAT YOUNG MAN 
OGILVY'S EXPECTATIONS AT HOME HAD BECOME EQUALLY EXACTING 
HE SAW THE LETTERS HIS SON SENT FROM SCHOOL AS COPY TO BE CORRECTED 
I HAD THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A TUTORIAL IN WRITING FROM HIM ALL MY LIFE 
AND I'D WRITE HIM A LETTER IT WAS A LITTLE UNNERVING 
COS HE'D SEND IT BACK SOMETIMES WITH THE GRAMMAR CORRECTED 
AND THAT WASN'T PARTICULARLY WHAT A TWELVE YEAR OLD ONE WANTED TO HEAR OR A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WANTED TO HEAR 
BUT AS I LOOK BACK ON IT HE TAUGHT ME TO WRITE TERSELY AND TIGHTLY 
AS THE AGENCY GREW THE GREAT PERFECTIONIST BECAME A MEMO MANIAC 
THE MEMOS HE WROTE THOUGH THEY WERE SO POINTED 
IN THEIR COMMUNICATION THERE WAS NEVER A QUESTION OF WHAT HE MEANT 
IF HE DISAGREED HE WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING OR HE'D SAY VERY LITTLE 
HE WOULDN'T ARGUE WITH YOU 
HE WOULD GO AWAY AND HE'D WRITE YOU THIS SIMPLY AWFUL AWFUL MEMO 
HE WAS A BULLY BEHIND A TYPEWRITER 
JOEL I THOUGHT YOU PROMISED TO SHOW ME THE SEARS ADS WITH COPY LAST TUESDAY 
IT IS NOW THREE MONTHS SINCE STRUTHERS PICKED THEM LONGER THAN THE PERIOD OF GESTATION IN PIGS 
PIGS IN CAPITAL LETTERS SIGNED DO 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT OGILVY SUCCEEDED IN LURING THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE LUXURY CAR MAKER TO THE COMPANY 
ON THE CAMPAIGN OGILVY REACHED HIS CREATIVE PEAK 
COMBINING THE SOFT SELL STYLE AND GOOD MANNERS WITH THE DETAIL AND RESEARCH OF THE HARD SALES PITCH 
HE WAS NOT FLY BY NIGHT JUST SORT OF TOSSING HIS CURLS AND SAYING 
LET'S DO SOMETHING WONDERFUL IN MAUVE TODAY 
WHEN WE GOT ROLLS ROYCE A TINY BUDGET THAT BIG 
I DECIDED I'D GOT TO I WAS THE WRITER I'D GOT TO DO SOMETHING BETTER THAN DETROIT HAD EVER DONE 
HE HAD A SALESMAN'S BACKGROUND AND SO THE ROLLS ROYCE THING WAS 
A GIFT TO HIM BECAUSE HE SPOKE TO THESE ENGINEERS AT ROLLS ROYCE AND SAID TELL ME HOW YOU MAKE THE CAR 
WHY HAS IT COST THIS MUCH MONEY THEY TOLD HIM AND HE WROTE IT DOWN 
THE BUDGET WAS A MEAGRE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT OGILVY DRAFTED OVER ONE HUNDRED HEADLINES BEFORE SETTLING ON ONE 
THAT HAS BECOME PROBABLY THE BEST KNOWN CAR AD OF ALL TIME 
AT SIXTY M. P. H. THE LOUDEST NOISE IN YOUR ROLLS ROYCE IS THE TICKING OF 
THE ELECTRIC CLOCK AND THE ENGINEERS WERE FURIOUS 
THEY SAID SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BLOODY CLOCK 
VERY VERY CLEAR PROSE STYLE BUT THE OCCASIONAL USE OF A REALLY REALLY INTERESTING ADJECTIVE 
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE ROLLS ROYCE ADVERTISEMENT THE ONE IS DIFFIDENT 
IF YOU ARE TOO DIFFIDENT TO DRIVE A ROLLS ROYCE YOU CAN HAVE A BENTLEY 
BUT THE USE OF THAT LANGUAGE IS PARTLY THERE JUST TO REMIND YOU THAT THE WRITER IS NO IDIOT EITHER 
AS ALWAYS OGILVY BLURRED THE LINES BETWEEN THE MAN AND THE BRAND 
NOT ONLY DID ROLLS ROYCE SALES RISE BY FIFTY PER CENT IN THE NEXT YEAR OGILVY HAD A NEW CHAUFFER DRIVEN COMPANY CAR 
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CAR YOU CAN DRIVE IN 
AND DRIVING IN A ROLLS ROYCE DOWN FIFTH AVENUE 
MY GOODNESS WHAT A PLEASURE THAT WAS 
I HAVE A ROLLS ROYCE AND MY EXCUSE FOR IT IS THAT ROLLS ROYCE CLIENT 
I WAS WALKING DOWN MADISON AVENUE TO GET TO WORK ONE DAY IN THE SUMMER 
AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY BLINDING HOT AND VERY HUMID THE WAY NEW YORK GETS 
AND I WAS TRUDGING DOWN THERE THIS ROLLS ROYCE DRAWS UP 
AND THE WINDOW COMES DOWN AND DAVID POKES HIS HEAD OUT AND SAYS 
ERM IF YOU WORK VERY HARD 
AND IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL 
ONE DAY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GO TO WORK IN A CIVILISED FASHION LIKE THIS 
PUT THE WINDOW UP SAID DON'T BE LATE 
BY NINETEEN SIXTY THE AGENCY WAS A WELL OILED MACHINE 
AND OGILVY RETURNED TO HIS ROLE AS SALESMAN WOOING NEW CLIENTS 
THERE WAS ONE PROBLEM OGILVY HATED TO FLY 
THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM BOARDING A PLANE TO LONDON TO BAG ANOTHER OF HIS TOP FIVE SHELL 
BASICALLY WHAT HE WOULD DO WAS TAKE SEVERAL POWERFUL SLEEPING PILLS AND THEN HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF BRANDY 
AND SO HE'D BE CROCKED AND ASLEEP AND THERE HE WAS YOU KNOW DEAD TO THE WORLD 
HE DIDN'T HAVE AN APPOINTMENT 
BUT OGILVY PERSUADED SHELL'S CHAIRMAN TO LUNCH WITH HIM AT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
AND PITCHED HIM ON THE WAY BACK 
AND I ASKED HIM AS HE WAS TELLING THIS STORY 
WHEN HE WENT TO LONDON I SAID I SUPPOSE YOU HAD OTHER THINGS TO DO WHILE YOU WERE IN LONDON 
HE SAID NO NOTHING I JUST SAT THERE 
TWIDDLING MY THUMBS HOPING FOR THE TELEPHONE TO RING 
BUT THAT WAS THAT I THINK IS A MEASURE OF HIS HIS PERSISTENCE 
OGILVY GOT THE ACCOUNT 
IT WAS WORTH A STAGGERING TWELVE POINT FIVE DOLLARS M. A YEAR BOOSTING BILLINGS TO FIFTY DOLLARS M. 
THE AGENCY OGILVY BUILT IN HIS OWN IMAGE WAS NOW TOO BIG TO BE RUN AS A ONE MAN BRAND 
AND HE DOESN'T DO THE SHELL ADVERTISING HE HANDS IT OFF 
TO OTHER PEOPLE TO PRODUCE THOSE ADS 
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO RISK HIS OWN ECCENTRIC WAYS ON IT 
THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH FOR SHELL OIL 
THE MAVERICK STOOD BACK SUPERVISING CAMPAIGNS IN THE HARD SELL STYLE HE HAD ONCE DISLIKED 
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY REALLY EXPECTED THAT ANYBODY WOULD READ ONE OF THOSE SHELL ADS 
EVERY AD WAS A LONG COPY AD SIX SEVEN HUNDRED WORDS 
BUT OGILVY'S VIEW AND HIS THEORY WAS THAT IT GAVE THE BRAND 
THE IMPRESSION OF BEING RELIABLE AND THOROUGHLY BACKED UP BY RESEARCH 
AND YOU KNOW BETTER THAN SOME WHIMSICAL 
BLOKE IN A COWBOY HAT TRYING TO SELL YOU A TANKFUL OF KINOCO 
TO RETAIN CONTROL OF HIS COMPANY OGILVY FORMULATED RULES OF WRITING THAT HE FORCED HIS STAFF TO FOLLOW 
HE HAS A CERTAIN WAY OF TYPEFACE AND A CERTAIN WAY OF WRITING 
AND A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WORDS IN THE FIRST SENTENCE BUT IT WORKS 
DON'T USE MORE THAN TWELVE WORDS IN A SENTENCE DON'T USE SUPERLATIVES OR COMPARATIVES 
THERE ARE NO RULES IN ADVERTISING 
THIS WAS JUST OGILVY'S ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE A RATIONAL 
UNIVERSE ON WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY AN IRRATIONAL WAY OF MAKING A LIVING 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO PERHAPS SENSING THE ADVENT OF SEISMIC CHANGE OGILVY COMBINED HIS FLAIR 
OF SELF PROMOTION RULE MAKING AND MEMO WRITING IN A BOOK CONFESSIONS OF AN ADVERTISING MAN 
THIS THING YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IT WAS A BESTSELLER IN THIRTEEN LANGUAGES 
AND IT'S STILL REQUIRED READING IN BUSINESS SCHOOLS ALL OVER THE WORLD 
HE DESCRIBED AND EXPLAINED THE BUSINESS TO THE WORLD 
ADVERTISING USED TO ALWAYS BE GEE WHAT IS IT THAT THESE GUYS DO 
ARE THEY MANIPULATING US 
DAVID SHOWED EXACTLY WHAT'S DONE HOW IT'S DONE AND HOW IT SHOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO DO IT 
THE FIRST TIME AUTHOR EXPECTED CONFESSIONS TO SELL ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND COPIES 
INSTEAD THE BOOK SOLD FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
IT'S STILL IN PRINT A MILLION COPIES LATER 
HIS FIRST BOOK HE TOLD ME HE SAID DO YOU KNOW I'VE MADE THE MOST GHASTLY MISTAKE AND I SAID WHY 
HE SAID THE BOOK'S ALREADY SOLD SIXTY THOUSAND COPIES IN HARDBACK 
THIS WAS ONLY A WEEK OR SO AFTER IT APPEARED AND I MADE OVER ALL THE ROYALTIES TO MY SON 
CONFESSIONS OF AN ADVERTISING MAN MADE OGILVY A PUBLIC FIGURE 
A CELEBRITY THE ONLY MAD MAN WITH A PROFILE OUTSIDE THE PROFESSION 
OGILVY WAS AWARDED A C. B. E. BY THE QUEEN FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS IN PROMOTING BRITISH PRODUCTS ABROAD 
THE AUTHOR'S LIFELONG REGRET WAS THAT IT WAS NOT THE O. B. E. HE FELT HE DESERVED 
HERE IT IS HERE'S MY MEDAL SHE HUNG ROUND MY NECK 
REMEMBER SHE ASKED ME WHAT IS YOUR WORK 
I SAID I'M IN THE ADVERTISING BUSINESS IN NEW YORK 
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE EXPRESSION ON HER FACE A MIXTURE OF INCREDULITY HORROR AND AMUSEMENT 
HE WAS CERTAINLY IMPERIOUS AND HE WAS CERTAINLY I'M DAVID OGILVY 
DOESN'T EVERYONE KNOW THAT 
I MEAN HOW COULD YOU EVEN ASK ME WHAT BUSINESS I'M IN 
I'M ADVERTISING HE WAS VERY MUCH IMPRESSED WITH HIMSELF 
CHANGE WAS IN THE AIR ACROSS AMERICA AND ON MADISON AVENUE 
OGILVY'S NEWLY RIGID RULES WERE MORE AND MORE AT ODDS WITH THE WAY THE AD 
INDUSTRY WAS DEVELOPING ESPECIALLY WITH T. V. BY NOW THE DOMINANT MEDIUM 
I THINK HIS APPROACH IN TRUTH WAS POSSIBLY TOO RATIONAL FOR TELEVISION 
THAT IN ADOPTING THAT FAIRLY RATIONAL ARGUED SEQUENTIAL 
APPROACH YOU WEREN'T REALLY USING T. V. FOR WHAT IT WAS BEST FOR WHICH IS A MUCH MORE EMOTIONAL THING 
THE MEN IN GREY SUITS WERE USURPED BY BOYS IN BLUE JEANS 
UNEDUCATED STREET KIDS STRAIGHT OUT OF ART COLLEGE 
THEY HAD NO INTEREST IN RULES OR CODES EXCEPT IN BREAKING THEM 
IT BECAME KNOWN AS THE CREATIVE REVOLUTION 
AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A WILDNESS 
AND THE COUNTRY WAS GOING WILD 
AND SO THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY WENT WILD ALONG WITH IT 
SO IT WAS DRINKING AND DRUGS 
AND OGILVY SORT OF WAS SUPPRESSED BY THESE REAL WILD MEN 
WHO WERE RUNNING AROUND WITHOUT SHIRTS OR SHOES IN ADVERTISING AGENCIES AND CARRYING ON 
ERM SO IT CHANGED 
YESTERDAY'S ECCENTRIC BECOMES TODAY'S OLD GENERATION OLD LINE PERSON 
ON HIS GOOD DAYS HE WOULD BE THE YOUNG TURK OF MADISON AVENUE HE'D BE ALMOST SKIPPING DOWN THE HALLS 
LEAPING INTO OFFICES AND EXHORTING PEOPLE TO GREATER EFFORTS 
QUICKER FASTER BETTER 
AND THEN WHEN HE WASN'T FEELING SO GREAT HE'D COME IN AS HE OFTEN USED TO DO 
TO STEAL A CIGARETTE AND HE'D FLOP ON THE CHAIR 
AND HE SAID TO ME ONCE HE SAID I'M AN EXTINCT VOLCANO 
AND I SAID WELL I'M VERY SORRY TO HEAR THAT 
HE SAID AND I AM SURROUNDED BY DRUNKARDS AND FORNICATORS LOOK AT THIS OFFICE HE SAID 
WE'RE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE AGENCY AND WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IF GENERAL MOTORS SHOULD CALL 
AND SO I SAID WELL WE'VE GOT ROLLS ROYCE ANYWAY 
AND HE SAID DON'T BE SUCH A FOOL 
WANDERED OFF 
AS THE SIXTIES PROGRESSED THE FORMER MAD MAN AND MAVERICK WAS BECOMING AN OLD FOGEY 
HE MIGHT HAVE INTRODUCED FLAIR AND IMAGINATION TO MADISON AVENUE 
BUT THE NEW GENERATION OF MAD MEN WERE GOING EVEN FURTHER 
OGILVY WAS NOT IMPRESSED 
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN NOISY LUNATICS ON THE FRINGES OF THE ADVERTISING BUSINESS 
THEIR STOCK IN TRADE INCLUDES ETHNIC HUMOUR 
ECCENTRIC ART DIRECTION CONTEMPT FOR RESEARCH AND THEIR SELF PROCLAIMED GENIUS 
THEY ARE SELDOM FOUND OUT BECAUSE THEY GRAVITATE 
TO THE KIND OF CLIENTS WHO BAMBOOZLED BY THEIR RHETORIC 
DO NOT HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR SALES RESULTS 
HE LIKED TO ARGUE HE LIKES DISPUTING I THINK AGREEMENT RATHER BORES HIM 
HE'S SWIMMING AGAINST THE STREAM AND I THINK HE RATHER LIKES THAT BECAUSE IT LETS HIM STAND OUT 
OGILVY HAD HIS OWN BRAND OF ADVERTISING 
AND HIS ADVERTISING WORKED 
BY THE MID NINETEEN SIXTIES OGILVY AND AMP MATHER WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN ITS FOUNDER HAD DARED DREAM 
OGILVY WAS NOW CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S 
TOP TEN AD AGENCIES WITH BILLINGS OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR 
BUT ADLAND WAS NO LONGER ANY FUN 
OGILVY LATER CONFESSED THAT THE MOVE FROM A CREATIVE ROLE INTO MANAGEMENT 
WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE HE HAD EVER MADE 
HE CAME TO LIKE THE BUSINESS LESS OR LIKE HIS WORK LESS AND IN FACT SAYS AS MUCH IN THE MID SIXTIES 
I'M VERY TIRED OF THE ADVERTISING BUSINESS THE CONSTANT DEALING WITH CLIENTS CONSTANT PROBLEMS 
HE'D MOVED AWAY FROM THE PRODUCTION OF ADS AND THAT WAS THE PART THAT 
WAS FUN AND CREATIVELY SATISFYING INTELLECTUALLY SATISFYING 
THAT WAS THE GREATEST MISTAKE I EVER MADE 
I WAS FAR MORE VALUABLE AND USEFUL TO MY CLIENTS WHEN I WAS WRITING THE ADVERTISING 
THAN I WAS RUNNING OUR BUSINESS 
AND I REGRET THAT I DEPLORE THAT 
OGILVY HAD EVERY REASON TO BE PROUD OF HIMSELF BUT REMAINED 
HAUNTED BY INSECURITY AND FEAR THAT THE COMPANY WOULD COLLAPSE 
IT LED HIM TO CASH IN AND TAKE OGILVY AND AMP MATHER PUBLIC IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX 
THE FIRST AGENCY TO FLOAT ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE 
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE WENT PUBLIC WAS HE JUST BELIEVED THE WHOLE THING COULD DISAPPEAR 
I THINK THE NERVOUSNESS WAS UNWARRANTED 
IT PROBABLY PREVENTED HIM ENJOYING THAT PERIOD OF HIS LIFE 
WHERE IN SOME WAYS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SWANNING AROUND AND SIMPLY ENJOYING THE ADULATION 
BUT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY IN THAT MOULD OF ONLY THE PARANOID SURVIVE 
HE WAS ALWAYS WORKING HE WAS ALWAYS ANGUISHED THINKING OH IT MIGHT GO WRONG THEY MIGHT GO ELSEWHERE 
MAYBE IT WAS THE INSECURITY 
THAT DAVID HAD INSIDE HIMSELF SINCE HE WAS A CHILD 
BY THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES OGILVY HAD RETIRED FROM A FULL TIME ROLE 
THE MADISON AVENUE MATERIALIST RETREATED TO RURAL FRANCE 
THIS REACHING BACK TO SOMETHING BEFORE ADVERTISING BEFORE MODERNITY SOMETHING MORE SOLID 
AND AGAIN IT'S THE MAN WHO CARRIED TOO MUCH SAIL TRYING TO FIND A REALLY GOOD MOORING 
AND FINALLY WINDING UP IN THIS TWELFTH CENTURY CHATEAU 
AFTER HIS SECOND MARRIAGE ENDED IN ANOTHER DIVORCE OGILVY WOOED 
AND WED HIS THIRD AND LAST WIFE HERTA LANS 
HE DID IT WITH THE AID OF A LIST 
HE WROTE ME A VERY FUNNY LETTER 
WHICH WASN'T REALLY A LETTER 
HE SAID I LOVE YOU BECAUSE 
AND THERE WAS A LIST IT WAS JUST FACTS FACTS FACTS 
SO I THINK THAT IS THE WAY HE WORKED 
INSTEAD OF TELLING ME LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE WOULD TELL YOU SOME VERY FLATTERING THINGS 
EVEN IN HIS LATER YEARS OGILVY COULD NOT SHAKE OFF HIS SELF DOUBT 
HE TOLD US A STORY ABOUT TAKING AN I. Q. TEST IN SOME 
PUBLICATION AND DISCOVERING ER THAT HIS I. Q. WAS ONLY NINETY SEVEN 
IT'S PAR FOR DITCH DIGGERS YOU KNOW 
I THOUGHT I MIGHT GET ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
I KNEW I WASN'T A GENIUS 
I DID ALL THE TESTS AND IT WAS CONSISTENTLY NINETY SIX 
FOR A FEW DAYS I WALKED AROUND MISERABLE DEPRESSED 
AND THEN REALISING THAT FOR SOMEBODY FOR WITH SUCH A LOW I. Q. HE'D ACTUALLY DONE REMARKABLY WELL 
AND HE SAID THAT CHEERED HIM UP 
MY WIFE THEN TOOK THE TEST 
I SAID YOU CAN'T DO IT YOU CAN HARDLY SPEAK ENGLISH 
WELL SHE CAN SPEAK VERY WELL BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A VERY GOOD ENGLISH VOCABULARY TO DO THESE I. Q. TESTS 
SHE TOOK IT AND SHE GOT A FAR HIGHER SCORE AND IT'S CHANGED OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP 
DAVID WAS A DIFFICULT PERSON TO LIVE WITH BECAUSE HIS STANDARDS WERE SO HIGH 
IT HAD TO BE THE WAY HE WANTED IT TO BE 
HE WAS MOSTLY RIGHT BUT HE WASN'T ALWAYS RIGHT 
SUDDENLY I'M UGLY AND DUMB AND SHE'S CLEVER AND PRETTY 
SO FROM THEN ON I FOUND MYSELF ASKING HER ADVICE ON ALL KINDS 
OF NEW QUESTIONS WHICH I WOULD NEVER HAVE MENTIONED TO HER BEFORE 
AND WHEN HE WASN'T RIGHT I WOULD STAND UP AND SAY THIS IS WRONG 
BUT HE DIDN'T LIKE HUH 
HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO HAVE EVERYBODY BOW TO HIM ON MADISON AVENUE 
OGILVY WAS UNPREPARED FOR A NEW THREAT DURING THE MERGER AND ACQUISITIONS MANIA OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
OGILVY LOST CONTROL OF HIS COMPANY ONCE AND FOR ALL 
W. P. P. IS TO MERGE WITH THE AMERICAN OGLESBY GROUP 
THE MOVE MASTERMINDED BY MARTIN SORRELL 
THE HEAD OF W. P. P. WILL CREATE THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST ADVERTISING AGENCY AFTER SAATCHI AND SAATCHI 
WE HAD COME TO THE VIEW THAT DAVID'S RESPONSE 
TO ANY INITIATIVE THAT WE TOOK 
WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HOSTILE AND WOULD INVOLVE INVECTIVE 
AND IT COULD BE QUITE NASTY 
BUT WE KNEW DAVID WAS GOING TO BE VERY VERY EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT 
IN EARLY MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE OGILVY SAT WITH HIS SON DAVID JNR 
AND LISTENED AS TAKEOVER TYCOON MARTIN SORRELL 
HEAD OF W. P. P. WIRE AND AMP PLASTIC PRODUCTS P. L. C. 
ANNOUNCED HIS PURCHASE OF OGILVY'S CORPORATE CHILD 
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY STUNNED 
HE THOUGHT THAT MARTIN MAYBE WAS NOT ENOUGH OF AN ADVERTISING MAN 
HIS INITIAL FURY WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE TAKEN OVER 
BY SOMEONE THAT WAS NOT A CREATIVE 
HE SAID IT WAS LIKE HAVING MY CHILD SOLD INTO SLAVERY 
IT FREAKS OGILVY OUT 
HE SAID THE IDEA OF THAT ODIOUS LITTLE SHIT 
BUYING MY AGENCY WITH BORROWED MONEY JUST GIVES ME THE CREEPS 
HE WAS SHAKY HE WAS SO UPSET 
I REALLY THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK AND THAT'D BE THE END OF HIM 
I JUST DIDN'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO 
OGILVY WENT FOR A WALK AND HIS SON FEARED HE MAY NEVER RETURN 
WHEN HE DID A FEW HOURS LATER THE AD MAN HAD MADE PEACE WITH THE SITUATION 
AN HOUR LATER HE APPEARED AND HE WAS CALM AND PEACEFUL IT WAS FINE IT WAS OVER DONE 
AND HE'D JUST GOT ON WITH IT 
AND 
SORRY 
I SHOULD REPHRASE THAT 
I HONESTLY HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT MOMENT IN ALL THESE YEARS 
ERM I THOUGHT IT WAS SUCH AN ADMIRABLE QUALITY THAT HE COULD GET A HANDLE OF IT AND SAY O. K. 
MY BABY HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM ME 
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE THIS THING THE BEST IT POSSIBLY CAN BE 
AND HE BECAME FRIENDLY WITH MARTIN SORRELL AND LIKED HIM A LOT 
I THOUGHT THAT IF HE DID BECOME CHAIRMAN WHICH HE DID AGREE TO DO 
THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL AND HE WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS FATHER FIGURE FOR US WHICH HE PROVED TO BE 
BUT THE RELATIONSHIP FROM THEN ON WAS A PERFECTLY GOOD ONE 
OGILVY REINVENTED HIMSELF ONE LAST TIME AS COMPANY ELDER STATESMEN 
AND FROM TOUFFOU HE CONTINUED TO BOMBARD HIS COLLEAGUES WITH MEMOS 
HE WAS WAITING FOR THE MAIL EVERY DAY 
IT WAS SACRED THE HOUR WHEN THE MAIL ARRIVED 
AND THEN THE TELEX ARRIVED WHICH HE CALLED AT THE CERTAIN MOMENT 
THE VOMITING MACHINE COS IT WOULD NEVER STOP COMING COMING COMING 
HE DEALT WITH AN ENORMOUS VOLUME OF MAIL FROM TOUFFOU TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT WITH THE GLORIOUS BUREAUCRACY 
OF THE FRENCH POSTAL SERVICE THE LOCAL POSTMAN GOT A PROMOTION 
AND A NEW VAN ON THE STRENGTH OF THE GROWING VOLUME OF MAIL THAT WAS PASSING THROUGH HIS SUB POST OFFICE 
I STILL WORK BUT NOT THE WAY I USED TO 
I SEE THE CAMPAIGNS CREATED BY ALL OUR OFFICES AND SOMETIMES I COMMENT ON THEM 
TOWARDS THE END OF HIS LIFE OFTEN SURROUNDED BY HIS GRAND CHILDREN 
OGILVY FOUND THE PEACE THAT HAD ELUDED HIM IN HIS YEARS AS AN AMISH FARMER 
HE LOVED THE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS INVENT NEW THINGS 
AND HE PUSHED THEM TO BE NAUGHTY TO SEE HOW FAR THEY COULD GO ABSOLUTELY 
IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES OGILVY BEGAN TO SUFFER FROM ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
AND THEN EMPHYSEMA PARTICULARLY INAPPROPRIATE ILLNESSES FOR SUCH AN ACTIVE MAN 
IT WAS DIFFICULT 
ALZHEIMER IS A DIFFICULT ILLNESS 
DAVID WAS VERY COURAGEOUS DURING HIS ILLNESS 
AS HE WAS CLEVER HE TRIED TO HIDE IT THAT HE WAS FORGETTING THINGS 
AND LOSING PASSPORTS AND ALL THIS 
BUT HE STAYED IN TOUFFOU WE KEPT HIM IN TOUFFOU UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT 
I DON'T THINK DAVID HAD LOTS OF REGRETS 
I THINK HE THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN A VERY LUCKY MAN 
HE WAS CONTENT 
HE GOT UP THE BLUE SKY HE WENT WALKING 
HE PLAYED WITH THE DOG WITH THE KIDS HE PLANTED HE MOWED HE WROTE MEMOS 
HE WAS CONTENT 
I'VE NEVER BEEN BORED BY MY JOB 
ABOVE ALL I'VE MADE SOME WONDERFUL FRIENDS FRIENDS WITH MY PARTNERS 
AND WITH OUR CLIENTS AND WITH SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS 
I'D LIKE TO BE REMEMBERED 
AS WHAT AS A COPYWRITER WHO HAD SOME BIG IDEAS 
THAT'S WHAT THE ADVERTISING BUSINESS IS ALL ABOUT BIG IDEAS 
DAVID OGILVY DIED ON JULY TWENTY FIRST NINETEEN NINETY NINE 
HE WAS EIGHTY EIGHT 
OGILVY WAS THE LAST OF THE GREAT POST WAR AD AGENCY HEADS 
THE ERA OF THE MAD MAN PASSED AWAY WITH HIM
