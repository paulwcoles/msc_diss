LATER IN THE PROGRAMME WE WILL LOOK 
AT THE RISKS INVOLVED IN GAP YEARS 
AND HOW YOUNG PEOPLE CAN STAY AS 
SAFE AS POSSIBLE FOR TEN YEARS AS 
CHANCELLOR GORDON BROWN HAD THE 
ECONOMY AS HIS SOUL FOCUS TODAY 
HE SAID AS PRIME MINISTER IT WAS 
HIS SOUL FOCUS ONCE AGAIN THE COST 
OF RAW MATERIALS FOR MANUFACTURERS 
HAS GONE UP RAISING FEARS OF 
INFLATION WE WILL REPORT ON THAT 
IN A MINUTE FIRST THE BAD NEWS HAS 
TAKEN ITS TOLL ON THE GOVERNMENT'S 
POLL RATINGS WEEKS BEFORE THE 
POLL RATINGS WEEKS BEFORE THE MAY LOCAL ELECTIONS MAYBE GORDON BROWN 
WAS LOOKING FOR DEVINE INSPIRATION 
TODAY VISITING A SIKH TEMPLE TO 
CAMPAIGN FOR THE LONDON ELECTIONS 
HE WAS POPULAR ENOUGH WITH THIS 
AUDIENCE ELSEWHERE HE IS IN 
TROUBLE THE P. M.'S BIGGEST WORRY IS 
THE ECONOMY BUT IT IS HIS BIGGEST 
PRIORITY TOO 
EVERY EFFORT OF MINE 
EVERY DAY THAT I WAKE UP IS ABOUT 
KEEPING THIS ECONOMY MOVING FORWARD 
KEEPING STABILITY IN THE ECONOMY 
AND KEEPING GROWTH IN BRITAIN WE 
HAVE HIGHER GROWTH THAN GERMANY 
FRANCE HIGHER GROWTH THAN AMERICA 
WE L. P. CONTINUE TO GROW IF WE DO THE 
RIGHT THINGS 
IT IS NOT JUST THE 
ECONOMY GORDON BROWN IS HEMMED IN 
BY PROBLEMS ON ALL SIDES M. P.'S ARE 
ANGRY ABOUT THE ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN P. RATE AND WORRYING ABOUT TERROR 
SUSPECTS TO BE LOCKED UP FOR FORTY TWO 
DAYS WITHOUT CHARGE 
THERE IS NO 
DOUBT THAT PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS 
ARE EXTREMELY HIGH WHEN GORDON 
BECAME PRIME MINISTER IT IS THOSE 
HIGH EXPECTATIONS NOT BEING 
REALISED WHICH HAS DISAPPOINTED 
PEOPLE THAT COMES OVER IT IS 
SORROW MORE THAN ANGER WITH GORDON 
THE IDEA THAT M. P.'S ARE GETTING READY 
TO SHOVE GORDON BROWN OUT OF A JOB 
IS FAR FETCHED DOZENS ARE WORRIED 
ABOUT THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
DIRECTION OR INDEED THE LACK OF IT 
ONE M. P. TOLD US THAT NUMBER TEN IS 
NOT GIVING ANY AMMUNITION TO 
CANDIDATES AROUND THE COUNTRY 
TRYING TO PERSUADE PEOPLE TO VOTE 
LABOUR IN THE ELECTIONS THE 
OPPOSITION PARTIES WELL THEY CAN 
HARDLY BELIEVE THEIR LUCK THESE THESE ISSUES DO NOT STEM FROM GORDON 
BROWN'S LEADERSHIP STYLE THEY STEM 
FROM DECISIONS TAKEN BY THIS 
GOVERNMENT WHICH AFFECT PEOPLE IN 
NEGATIVE WAYS SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE 
IN INCREASING TAX ON THE LOWEST 
PAID THAT IS WHY THE GOVERNMENT IS 
LOSING THE TRUST OF THE BRITISH 
PEOPLE TO HANDLE THE ECONOMIC 
PROBLEMS WE FACE 
MR. BROWN HAS 
PLUMMETED IN THE POLLS ONE 
SUGGESTS HE IS THE LEAST TRUSTED 
LEADER IN WESTERN EUROPE TO GUIDE 
HIS COUNTRY'S ECONOMY ANOTHER HAS 
HIM EXPERIENCING THE GREATEST SLIDE 
SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
GORDON BROWN HAS 
LOST TOUCH WITH THE EVERY DAY NEEDS 
OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE WORSE THAN 
THAT HE IS ABANDONING THE POOREST 
AND MOST NEEDY FAMILIES AT A TIME 
WHEN THEY NEED EXTRA HELP FROM 
GOVERNMENT 
GORDON BROWN HAS A LONG GOVERNMENT WAY TO GO TO PERSUADE THE PUBLIC 
AND HIS PARTY HE IS ON THEIR SIDE 
A FEW HANDSHAKES AND SMILES ON THE 
CAMPAIGN TRIAL WILL NOT BE ENOUGH 
ON THEIR OWN 
AS WE MENTIONED THERE WAS MORE BAD 
NEWS ON INFLATION TODAY OUR 
ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT IS AT THE 
MACVITTY'S BISCUIT FACTORY IN WEST 
LONDON THOSE RAW MATERIAL PRICES 
THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER HOW 
WORRYING ARE THEY 
WELL GEORGE 
FOR COMPANIES LIKE THIS ONE AND 
MANY OTHERS AROUND THE ECONOMY IT 
IS WORRYING BIG RAW MATERIAL COST 
INCREASES FROM AROUND THE WORLD 
BECAUSE OF FACTORS BEYOND ANY OF 
THEIR CONTROL LET'S SAY WHAT IS 
HAPPENING HERE THIS BISCUIT 
FACTORY WELL WHAT THEY ARE PAYING 
FOR THEIR INGREDIENTS FLOUR AND 
SO ON PRICES HAVE GONE UP SIXTY PER CENT OVER 
THE LAST YEAR IN TERMS OF THE 
PRICE OF THE BISCUITS LEAVING THE 
FACTORY GATES AND HEADING OFF TO 
RETAILERS THEY HAVE GONE UP AS WELL 
NOT AS MUCH AS THAT SIXTY PER CENT THESE 
OFFICIAL FIGURES TELL US YES THAT 
IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE ECONOMY 
RAW MATERIAL COSTS ARE RISING AT 
THEIR FASTEST RATE IN MORE THAN TWO 
DECADES THE PRICES OF GOODS 
LEAVING THE FACTORIES IS RISING AS 
WELL THAT IS STORING UP PROBLEMS 
FOR INFLATION THE MEASURE OF THE 
PRICES OF THE GOODS WE BUY IN THE 
SHOPS HOW QUICKLY IT FEEDS THROUGH 
NO ONE CAN BE TOTALLY SURE 
WE HAVE 
JUST HAD CUTS IN INTEREST RATES 
WHAT ARE THE PROSPECTS WHAT DOES 
THIS DO FOR THE PROSPECTS OF ANY 
MORE 
WELL IT IS A REAL NIGHTMARE MORE FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND THEIR JOB 
IS TO TARGET INFLATION TO KEEP 
THAT UNDER CONTROL INFLATION IS 
RISING ABOVE ITS TARGET SO THEIR 
NATURAL INCLINATION WOULD BE TO SAY 
LET'S KEEP INTEREST RATES WHERE 
THEY ARE FOR LONGER OF COURSE WE 
HAVE THE CREDIT CRUNCH FALLING 
HOUSE PRICES PREDICTIONS OF A 
SLOWDOWN SO THERE ARE PRESSURES TO 
CUT RATES IT IS A DIFFICULT 
BALANCING ACT
