IF SURNAMES ARE A LABEL TO THE TALENTS PEOPLE HAVE 
A BOY BORN IN LEEDS IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED 
NOT BARRY CRYER BUT BARRY LAUGHTER 
FOR FIFTY YEARS ON STAGE TELEVISION AND RADIO CRYER HAS BEEN 
MAKING PEOPLE SMILE OFTEN WITHOUT THEM KNOWING THE WIT CAME FROM HIM 
ALTHOUGH HIS COMEDY CAREER BEGAN IN STRIP CLUBS IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
TELLING GAGS BETWEEN THE ACTS HE TOOK A LONG TIME TO SHOW THE PUBLIC ALL HE HAD 
FOR MANY YEARS HE WAS HEARD BUT NOT SEEN WRITING JOKES FOR PERFORMERS 
INCLUDING FRANKIE HOWERD THE TWO RONNIES MORECAMBE AND WISE AND TOMMY COOPER 
HE BECAME MORE VISIBLE AND AUDIBLE AS A STAND UP COMEDIAN 
AFTER DINNER SPEAKER AND PANELLIST ON RADIO FOUR'S LONG RUNNING JOKE GAME SHOW I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T A CLUE 
HE ALSO CLAIMS WHICH HE INSISTS IS NOT A JOKE 
THAT HE WAS ONCE A CHART TOPPING POP STAR IN FINLAND 
IF ANYONE MIGHT HAVE A CLUE TO HOW HUMOUR WORKS IT'S BARRY CRYER 
LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE ANALYSED COMEDY 
AND THEY'VE WRITTEN BOOKS ABOUT WHY PEOPLE LAUGH AND HOW JOKES WORK 
YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF THIS ARE THERE ANY THEORIES OR RULES AS TO HOW IT WORKS 
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THEORIES 
I HEARD DENNIS NORDEN ON THE RADIO 
YESTERDAY AS YOU AND I ARE TALKING NOW 
AND DENNIS SAID HE AND FRANK MUIR MET MEL BROOKS IN AMERICA 
AND MEL BROOKS ASKED THEM WHAT THEY WERE CURRENTLY DOING 
AND THEY'D BOTH BECOME COMEDY CONSULTANTS IN TELEVISION 
MEL BROOKS SAID YOU MEAN YOU KNOW 
AND IT'S LIKE THAT ANALYSING COMEDY IS LIKE DISSECTING A FROG 
NOBODY LAUGHS AND THE FROG DIES YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS 
LONG BEFORE THERE WAS A PROGRAMME CALLED THE X. FACTOR 
I USED TO SAY THERE'S AN X. FACTOR AND BY THAT I MEANT 
HAVING WRITTEN FOR SO MANY COMEDIANS 
THE FINAL ANALYSIS IS YOU CAN'T ANALYSE QUITE WHY IT HAPPENS 
THEY HAVE SKILL AND TIMING AND A DELIVERY BUT THERE'S SOMETHING FUNNY 
THE OLD UNGRAMMATICAL SAYING PEOPLE WHO SAY FUNNY THINGS 
AND PEOPLE WHO SAY THINGS FUNNY YOU KNOW AS IN FUNNILY YOU CAN'T ANALYSE IT 
TOMMY COOPER IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE I SUPPOSE 
YOU KNEW HE WAS BIG AND UNGAINLY AND A BRILLIANT MAGICIAN WHO PRETENDED 
TO BE A BAD ONE AND HAD A FUNNY LAUGH AND A GREAT FACE 
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS THERE AS WELL THAT MADE AN AUDIENCE REALLY LIKE HIM AND LAUGH 
ERIC MORECOMBE I HEARD HIM ON THE RADIO AGAIN THE OTHER DAY IT WAS A TELEVISION SKETCH 
SO NO FACIAL EXPRESSIONS OR ANYTHING BUT EVERY SINGLE THING HE SAID 
EVEN A SINGLE WORD ERIC MORECAMBE WAS FUNNY 
IT'S THE DELIVERY THING 
GROUCHO MARX 
JACKIE MASON I THINK IS A CURRENT EXAMPLE 
THEY COULD MAKE THE PHONE BOOK SOUND FUNNY 
THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL SENSE OF DELIVERY THERE AGAIN INDEFINABLE 
WHY ARE THEIR VOICES FUNNIER THAN OTHER PEOPLE'S 
I'VE NEVER CEASED TO BE FASCINATED BY THIS 
PEOPLE BECOME OBSESSED NEIL SIMON THE AMERICAN PLAYWRIGHT 
USED TO SAY THAT CERTAIN VOWEL SOUNDS WERE FUNNIER THAN OTHERS ANOTHER EXAMPLE 
DAD'S ARMY WHEN THAT WAS DONE IN AMERICA 
AND THE CHARACTER PIKE BECAME HENDERSON 
YES THE LINE THE FAMOUS LINE IN BRITAIN DON'T TELL HIM PIKE 
ABOUT THE NAME IT DIDN'T GET A LAUGH IN AMERICA 
AND THEY BECAME OBSESSED THAT THAT WAS FOR SOME REASON HENDERSON WASN'T FUNNY IN THE WAY THAT PIKE WAS 
WELL PIKE'S GOT THE LETTER K. IN IT 
WHICH IS ONE OF NEIL SIMON'S PRECEPTS ISN'T IT YEAH 
THE LETTER K. IS GOOD HE DOES THAT IN THE SUNSHINE BOYS 
K. IS FUNNY KNICKERS IS FUNNY PANTIES ISN'T 
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THAT DO YOU THINK IT'S JUST A HARD CONSONANT SOUND I DON'T KNOW K.'S AND G.'S MAYBE 
WE'RE GETTING ANALYTICAL WE'RE DISSECTING THE FROG BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S NOT ILLOGICAL 
YOU'RE TRYING TO TRIGGER THAT REACTION IN THE AUDIENCE 
YES AND THE CONSONANT HITS THE EAR HARDER THAN THE VOWEL DOES 
AM I REALLY SAYING THIS 
IN ENGLISH COMEDY IN PARTICULAR THERE ARE CLEAR CHARACTERISTICS 
THE PUN FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF YOUR COMEDY ALL YOU'VE DONE 
HAS BEEN WORD PLAY WHEN YOU TALK TO FRENCH PEOPLE ABOUT THIS IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY ENGLISH 
THE ENGLISH LOVE PUNS 
I THINK THE FRENCH DO PUNS THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PUNS 
BUT IT'S NOT AS MUCH OF A STAPLE ELEMENT IN WHAT THEY DO 
WE'VE ALWAYS LOVED THAT WORDPLAY THE PUNNING AND THE SPOONERISM 
AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF AND THEY DON'T TRANSLATE PUNS DON'T TRAVEL 
I DON'T THINK AMERICANS ARE BIG ON PUNS ARE THEY 
THERE'S AN AMAZING ONE IN YOUR MEMOIRS A HUMPHREY LYTTELTON STORY ABOUT BIRD WATCHING 
OH YEAH IN WHICH THERE'S AN ASTONISHING DOUBLE WORDPLAY 
YES THE STORY GOES 
RADIO CLYDE IN SCOTLAND WELL IT WOULD BE WOULDN'T IT 
HUMPH WAS BEING INTERVIEWED HE WAS DOING SOME FOOD WRITING IN THOSE DAYS 
AND THE INTERVIEWER I'VE ASKED HER ABOUT THIS SAID 
MR. LYTTELTON I BELIEVE APART FROM YOUR JAZZ AND YOUR FOOD WRITING YOU'RE A VERY KEEN ORTINOLOGIST 
AND HUMPH SAID YOU MEAN WORD BOTCHER 
AND I TAXED HIM WITH THIS AND HE SAID L'ESPRIT D'ESCALIER I THOUGHT OF IT ON THE WAY HOME 
HE WAS VERY HONEST BUT THAT IS BRILLIANT 
BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THE AUDIENCE TO BE VERY QUICK TO GET IT 
BUT MINDS WORK LIKE THAT THAT THEY CAN SEE THE REVERSAL 
YEAH A GOOD PUN PAINTS ANOTHER PICTURE 
MY OLD FRIEND THE LATE DICK VOSBOROUGH 
WHO WAS A BRILLIANT SPOONERISM AND PUN MAN HE COULD LEAD ME BY THE NOSE 
AND SAY SOMETHING SERIOUSLY AND I'D FALL FOR IT EVERY TIME 
AND YEARS AGO WHEN BUSTER KEATON WAS STILL ALIVE 
DICK VOSBOROUGH SAID TO ME YOU KNOW THEY'RE DOING A NEW FILM 
ABOUT THE BATTLE OF THE LITTLE BIGHORN AND BUSTER KEATON IS PLAYING SITTING BULL 
WHICH WAS ENTIRELY CREDIBLE WITH THAT WONDERFUL FACE 
AND THEN DICK SAID IMAGINE THAT CUSTER BEATEN BY BUSTER KEATON 
AND THAT WAS DICK YOU SEE HE HAD YOU GOING ALL THE TIME 
I LOVE THAT IT'S PLAYING WITH THE LANGUAGE ENJOYING IT 
WE SEE IT IN YOUR AUTOBIOGRAPHY THAT YOU WRITE AN APPARENTLY SIMPLE LINE 
AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU REVERSE IT YOU DO SOMETHING WITH IT 
YES YOU TRY AND TURN IT ON ITS HEAD 
WE'RE ANALYSING IT WE ARE 
NO IT'S THE SORT OF SURPRISE ELEMENT OR THE INCONGRUOUS YOU KNOW 
YOU'RE LEADING THE AUDIENCE ALONG WITH A LINE OR A SENTENCE 
OR WHATEVER AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS AT THE END 
IT'S LIKE THE BANANA SKIN YOU DO SOMETHING THEY WEREN'T EXPECTING 
ON SPOTTING SOMETHING IN A LINE THERE'S A VERY FUNNY JOKE IN THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
I THINK IT'S IN A T. V. STUDIO WHERE 
SOMEBODY TURNS UP DURING A RECORDING WITH THE NEWS CILLA BLACK IS ILL AND SHE CAN'T SING 
OH YES I THINK I'M CREDITING IT OR DEBITING IT TO THE RIGHT MAN TOMMY MCQUATER 
GREAT SESSION MUSICIAN TRUMPETER AND RONNIE HAZELHURST THE M. D. 
THEY WERE GOING TO PRE RECORD A CHRISTMAS SHOW WITH CILLA 
AND THEN SHE GOT THE FLU OR SOMETHING AND THEY FINISHED UP 
DOING THE SHOW LIVE IN THE FINISH 
BUT RONNIE WALKED IN AND INFORMED THE BAND THEY WERE GOING TO BE PAID 
BUT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO DO THE SESSION THAT NIGHT CILLA'S ILL AND SHE CAN'T SING 
TOMMY MCQUATER SAID THE FIRST IS NEWS 
THAT'S THE STORY I HEARD CILL 
WE TALKED ABOUT PUNS IN ENGLISH ALSO THE DIRTY JOKE WHICH THERE ARE 
IN ALL CULTURES BUT PARTICULARLY IN ENGLISH COMEDY OH YES 
YOU HAD A LONG BLUE PERIOD WRITING FOR DANNY LA RUE 
YES BUT THERE AGAIN IT WAS PLAYING WITH THE LANGUAGE 
HE PLAYED A PRECURSOR FUNNILY ENOUGH LONG BEFORE MARGARET THATCHER ACHIEVED PROMINENCE 
WE HAD THIS FEARSOME TORY LADY CALLED LADY CYNTHIA GROPE 
AND SHE WOULD BE INTERVIEWED BY ME OR SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE SHOW 
AND YOU WOULD SAY TO LADY CYNTHIA LET'S TALK ABOUT EDWARD HEATH 
SHE WOULD SAY PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MICHAEL FOOT A WILD EXAGGERATION 
YOU KNOW IT WAS THAT SO THE AUDIENCE HAD TO KEEP UP WITH 
WHAT WAS GOING ON AND DAN LOVED THAT HE WOULDN'T COUNTENANCE 
SWEARING OR ANYTHING BUT HE LOVED THE DISGUISED THINLY DISGUISED DIRTY JOKE WHICH I ENJOY ENORMOUSLY 
AND PARTICULARLY IN THE START OF YOUR CAREER IN TELEVISION 
AND RADIO YOU COULDN'T GET AWAY WITH THAT MUCH NO 
THERE'S A MAX MILLER STORY WHERE HE TOLD A JOKE AT REHEARSAL WHICH SEEMS INCREDIBLY MILD NOW 
IT'S QUITE QUAINT THERE WAS HORROR ABOUT SAYING IT ON AIR 
DO YOU WANT ME TO YEAH THE STORY WAS THIS BUS BREAKS DOWN 
AND IT WAS THE DAYS WHEN THEY HAD A CONDUCTRESS ON THE BUS 
THE DRIVER SAID TO THE CONDUCTRESS 
I'M SORRY I'M DOING AN ABYSMAL IMPRESSION OF HIM BUT IT'S THE DELIVERY AGAIN 
HE SAYS DON'T BOTHER RINGING THE GARAGE 
I'LL HAVE A LOOK MYSELF 
TEN MINUTES GO BY THE PASSENGERS ARE GETTING IMPATIENT 
THE CONDUCTRESS WALKS DOWN AND SAYS 
DO YOU WANT A SCREWDRIVER HE SAYS NO WE'RE TEN MINUTES LATE ALREADY 
VERY MILD BY TODAY'S STANDARDS AND HE TOLD THIS AT THE RUN THROUGH 
OF A SHOW CALLED MIDDAY MUSIC HALL WHICH WAS LIVE ON THE RADIO MIDDAY 
AND THIS IS MID FIFTIES NO LATE FIFTIES IT WAS ABOUT NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT 
AND THE GREAT MILLER WAS TOP OF THE BILL 
SO HE TOLD THAT JOKE AND BILL WORSLEY 
I CAN REMEMBER THE PRODUCER'S NAME BURIED HIS HEAD IN HANDS 
AND SAID TO MAX YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL THAT TODAY 
I MIGHT I MIGHT NOT I DON'T KNOW 
SO WE ALL WENT TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES PUB IN NORTHUMBERLAND AVENUE RAY ELLINGTON AND HIS QUARTET 
THESE ARE TOPICAL NAMES THEY WERE ON THE SHOW AS WELL 
AND RAY PUT A BET ON IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY IN THE PUB 
THAT MAX WOULDN'T TELL THAT JOKE AND I THINK IT WAS A FIVE NOTE OR SOMETHING 
WHICH WAS A SOLID BET IN THOSE DAYS 
THEN WE ALL CLUSTERED ROUND WHEN THE GREAT MILLER WENT ON 
HE DID HIS ACT AND SANG HIS SONG AND FINISHED NEVER TOLD THE BUS JOKE 
WE ALL WENT BACK TO THE PUB RAY ELLINGTON APPROACHED MAX MILLER AND SAID COME ON PAY UP WHAT 
YOU NEVER TOLD THE BUS JOKE I WAS GOING TO THEN THEY FLASHED THAT LIGHT 
AND HE WOULDN'T PAY UP ON THE BET HE WOULDN'T BACK OFF ON THE BET 
THAT WAS HIS COVER STORY THEY FLASHED THE LIGHT I HADN'T GOT TIME 
HE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO TELL IT HE WAS JUST WINDING THE PRODUCER UP 
TO GET HIM ON EDGE FOR THE SHOW HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE TOLD IT 
ANOTHER THEORY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S BECOME 
A CLICHE IS THE UNHAPPINESS THAT LIES UNDERNEATH COMEDIANS 
BUT LIKE A LOT OF CLICHES IT'S HARD TO GET AWAY FROM IT 
EVEN READING YOUR BOOK THE PEOPLE YOU'VE WRITTEN FOR 
IT'S THERE IN A LOT OF THEM ISN'T IT 
YES TOMMY COOPER ERIC MORECAMBE TO SOME DEGREE THE STRESS THAT HE WAS UNDER ALL THE TIME 
YES THE SORT OF BROKEN HEARTED CLOWN THING I THINK 
IS OVERDONE BY A LOT OF PEOPLE 
LES DAWSON PARTICULARLY WAS JUST THE SAME OFF AS ON BASICALLY 
A HIGHLY INTELLIGENT MAN OBVIOUSLY AND MUST HAVE HAD HIS DOWN MOMENTS BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE 
THERE WAS VIRTUALLY NO JOIN BUT WHAT YOU JUST MENTIONED WAS 
HE GAVE SO MUCH OF HIMSELF OFF STAGE AS WELL AS ON 
THAT MAYBE THAT STRESS REALLY GOT TO LES IN THE FINISH 
DAVID NOBBS AND I USED TO WRITE FOR HIM A LOT AND WE WOULD SEE HIM 
IN FULL CRY IN THE BAR BEFORE A T. V. RECORDING GO UP AND EXCUSE OURSELVES 
TO PEOPLE HE WAS TALKING TO AND SAY COME WITH US LESLEY AND SIT DOWN YOU'RE WORKING TONIGHT SO HE WAS 
APPARENTLY VERY UNCOMPLICATED IN THAT RESPECT LES WAS JUST THE SAME BUT THE PRIME EXAMPLES 
THE EXTREME EXAMPLES TONY HANCOCK FOR INSTANCE 
WHO HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND DEPRESSIONS AND KILLED HIMSELF 
NOT A STRANGER TO THE BOTTLE TOMMY COOPER AND ERIC WAS A WORRIER 
WHEN THEY CUT DOWN ON THE ROUTINE OF SHOWS 
THEY'D STOPPED DOING THE BRUTAL EVERY WEEK RECORDINGS 
AND THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE DOING TWO OR THREE SHOWS A YEAR 
BUT HE WOULD WORRY ENOUGH ABOUT THOSE SHOWS HE WAS A PERFECTIONIST EVERYTHING HAD TO BE RIGHT OH YES 
AND THAT STRESS IT'S BECAUSE 
IF YOU MAKE SERIOUS SPEECHES EVEN AS A POLITICIAN 
YOU NEVER KNOW QUITE HOW BORED PEOPLE ARE PERHAPS 
BUT IF YOU TELL A JOKE AND IT DOESN'T WORK 
IT'S NAKED I WOULD SAY IF YOU'RE A SINGER AND YOU'VE GOT A GOOD VOICE 
AND YOU CHOOSE YOUR MATERIAL AND YOUR VOICE IS IN GOOD SHAPE 
MOST AUDIENCES WILL LISTEN AND CLAP AT THE END BUT COMEDY'S VERY PERSONAL 
WITHIN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES YOU KNOW IF IT'S WORKING OR NOT 
THEY SAY I LOVE HIM I CAN'T STAND HER 
IN A WAY THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT OTHER PERFORMERS REALLY 
IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T MAKE YOU LAUGH YOU RESENT IT 
THEY'RE PAID TO MAKE YOU LAUGH IT ALMOST POLARISES PEOPLE COMEDY IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN MENTION ANY NAME 
THERE ARE CERTAIN GLORIOUS EXCEPTIONS ALTHOUGH I MET A MAN ONCE 
WHO SAID ERIC AND ERNIE NEVER DID ANYTHING FOR ME 
MY GRANDFATHER WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM WHEN ERIC MORECAMBE CAME ON T. V. 
WELL THERE WE GO AND TOMMY COOPER I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE 
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYBODY SAY WELL HE NEVER MADE ME LAUGH I COULDN'T SEE THAT AT ALL 
HE'S A GLORIOUS EXCEPTION HE SEEMED TO HAVE HAD ACCEPTANCE ALL OVER THE PLACE 
BUT IT DOES POLARISE PEOPLE AND COMEDIANS USE VIOLENT EXPRESSIONS THEMSELVES 
THEY SAY I DIED 
AND IF IT WENT VERY WELL THEY SAY I KILLED THEM IT'S REALLY SORT OF VERY EXTREME LANGUAGE 
YOU REFER IN THE MEMOIRS JUST ONCE IN PASSING YOU TALK ABOUT 
THERE HAVE BEEN DEPRESSIONS THERE HAVE BEEN FAILURES 
WHAT ABOUT YOU THERE IS WITHOUT INVOKING A CLICHE 
THERE'S BEEN SOME UNHAPPINESS UNDERNEATH IT ALL 
WITH ME 
YES MAINLY 
MAINLY OPERATIONS AND A BIT OF HEALTH PROBLEMS HERE AND THERE 
BUT NOT I CAN HONESTLY SAY HAND ON HEART THAT 
IN OUR BUSINESS THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME AWFUL THINGS GOING ON AND IF YOU LIFTED THE LID 
THE LID WAS LIFTED ONCE OR TWICE AND I WENT OH 
BUT I SEEM TO HAVE SPENT YEARS UNLESS I'M REMARKABLY INSENSITIVE OR UNOBSERVANT 
I SPENT MY TIME MAINLY WITH PEOPLE I LIKED AND ADMIRED 
LAUGHING A LOT I'M RARELY IN TELEVISION STUDIOS THESE DAYS 
BUT I DO GET DEPRESSED NOW WHEN I GO IN THEM THEY'RE DOING A COMEDY SHOW AND NOBODY'S LAUGHING 
YOU TAKE THE JOB SERIOUSLY BUT IN REHEARSALS WE WERE ALWAYS 
LAUGHING ABOUT SOMETHING THERE WAS A LEVITY THERE THAT KEPT YOU GOING THROUGH THE DAY 
THAT'S BECAUSE OF A TREND WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT TOWARDS 
WITH THE YOUNGER PERFORMERS A VERY SERIOUS KIND OF COMEDY 
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT RICKY GERVAIS STEVE COOGAN ARE DOING 
OH YEAH THERE'S MORE INTELLIGENCE 
AROUND NOW A HELL OF A LOT OF INTELLIGENCE BUT THE WARMTH FACTOR 
THE X. FACTOR THE WARMTH THE THING THAT WHEN SOMEBODY WALKS ON 
THE AUDIENCE GO WE'RE IN SAFE HANDS 
PETER KAY'S GOT IT I THINK BILLY CONNOLLY'S STILL GOT IT 
THERE'S A GREAT WAVE OF WARMTH 
BUT I HATE PEOPLE MY AGE WHO KNOCK WHAT'S GOING ON NOW 
BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY BRILLIANT PEOPLE AROUND NOW 
AND AS YOU INDICATED 
VERY SERIOUS SERIOUS ISSUES NOT JUST JOKES OBSERVATIONAL THINGS 
I DO SOMETHING ON THE FRINGE EVERY YEAR AT EDINBURGH 
AND THEY CALL ME UNCLE BAZ THE YOUNG STAND UPS AND THEY LOVE JOKES 
IN CONVERSATION 
THAT IS A COMMON CURRENCY WITH WHATEVER AGE YOU ARE AS A COMIC 
BUT THEY DON'T DO JOKES WHEN THEY'RE ON 
ROSS NOBLE ACTUALLY SAID TO ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS SO OLD IT'S NEW DON'T CHANGE A THING 
I'M PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE THERE WHO TELLS JOKES PER SE 
I LOVE PEOPLE WHO ARE OBSERVATIONAL AND RIFFING OFF THE AUDIENCE 
AND SPIRALLING OFF ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT I LOVE THAT 
SO FOR DISTINCTION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GAGS A FORMAL GAG 
THAT HAS A SET UP AND A PUNCH LINE 
YES WHAT I DO IS FORMULAIC IT IS ONE LINERS JOKES AND ANECDOTES 
AND CLEARLY LAID OUT BEFORE YOU 
ANOTHER CLICHE WHICH PEOPLE ALWAYS SEIZE ON WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE INTO COMEDY IS THE SCHOOL YEARS 
THE FAMOUS THINGS OF HAVING STARTED TELLING JOKES TO AVOID BEING BULLIED OR TO WIN FAVOUR 
WE MIGHT AS WELL GET IT OUT OF THE WAY IS THERE ANY OF THAT FOR YOU 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
EMO PHILLIPS THE AMERICAN COMEDIAN WONDERFUL AN INTERVIEWER SAID TO HIM 
DID YOU MAKE YOUR COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS LAUGH TO AVOID THE SCHOOL BULLY I WAS THE SCHOOL BULLY 
I WAS A BILKO I WAS WHAT'S THE ANGLE HERE I SOLD 
THE SHORT CUT FOR THE CROSS COUNTRY RUN IN A SEALED ENVELOPE 
AND YOU HAD A BLACK MARKET DEAL GOING WITH DINNER TICKETS 
WE USED TO HAVE 
YEAH DINNER LUNCHTIME TICKETS IT'S SO STRANGE LOOKING BACK 
I THINK SOME WERE RETRIEVED FROM A BIN WHICH WE RECYCLED I MEAN 
I'M NOT PROUD OF ANY OF THIS BUT DUCKING AND DIVING ALL THE TIME 
BUT IN ONE WAY YOUR CHILDHOOD WAS ABOUT AS UNFUNNY AS IT CAN BE 
BECAUSE YOUR FATHER DIED WHEN YOU WERE VERY YOUNG VERY YOUNG YEAH 
AND THE OLDER I GET THE MORE ENVIOUS I AM WHEN PEOPLE SAY MY DAD OR MY FATHER 
BECAUSE OUTSIDE THE FAMILY 
I MET ONE OLDER MAN WHEN I WAS DOING AN AFTER DINNER IN LEEDS FOR BODDINGTONS A COMPANY UP THERE 
AND THIS OLDER GUY SAID ARE YOU CARL CRYER'S SON 
AND I SAID YES AND HE SAID OH I KNEW HIM 
SO I GRABBED HOLD OF HIM WE WENT AND HAD A PINT AND OBVIOUSLY 
IF HE DIDN'T LIKE MY FATHER OR MY FATHER WASN'T A LIKEABLE MAN 
HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE APPROACHED ME AT ALL 
BUT THE PICTURE HE PAINTED OF MY DAD BEING A REALLY GOOD MAN AND JOVIAL AND WARM AND EVERYTHING 
I GOT QUITE EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE WAS 
ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE FAMILY WHO SUDDENLY SPOKE ABOUT MY FATHER 
MY DEAR MOTHER NEVER SPOKE ABOUT HIM THAT WAS IT WHY WAS THAT THAT SHE COULDN'T BEAR TO 
SHE COULDN'T BEAR TO I DON'T THINK WHICH I RESPECTED BUT LOOKING BACK 
I REALISE THAT SHE NEVER MENTIONED HIM OTHER PEOPLE DID BUT NOT MY MUM 
YOU ALSO SAY SOMETHING VERY STRANGE IN THE MEMOIRS THAT 
YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S DEATH FROM A SCHOOL FRIEND 
YES I'D BEEN TOLD BY MY MOTHER THAT DAD WAS ILL 
AND 
SOMEBODY AT SCHOOL SAID AH YOUR DAD'S DEAD 
AND I COULDN'T COPE WITH THIS SO WE HAD A. 
WE HAD A FIGHT AND PUNCHED EACH OTHER A LOT AND I THOUGHT 
YOUNG AS I WAS I THOUGHT 
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT SO HE WAS IN HOSPITAL PRESUMABLY WAS HE YES 
YEAH AND HE HAD DIED AND SHE SIMPLY HADN'T TOLD YOU 
SHE TOLD ME HE WAS ILL HE WAS POORLY 
AND I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE 
WELL I DID MEET THE MAN BUT THE MEMORIES AREN'T TOO CLEAR 
BECAUSE I WAS SO YOUNG BUT HE WAS AN ACCOUNTANT AND A MASON AND A GOLFER 
HOW DIFFERENT CAN YOU BE FROM YOUR DAD BUT THAT FASCINATED ME 
A LOT OF PSYCHIATRISTS WOULD THINK THAT THIS MUST HAVE DAMAGED YOU 
IN SOME WAY OR AT LEAST AFFECTED YOU 
I DON'T KNOW I JUST STEAM ON I WOULD THINK THAT 
THERE'S PROBABLY A CASE TO BE MADE FOR THAT BUT I'M NOT PARTICULARLY INTERESTED 
OTHER PEOPLE INTEREST ME MORE THAN I DO IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
I JUST YOU KNOW GET ON WITH IT 
VERY BASIC NOT A VERY SENSITIVE APPROACH I SUPPOSE BUT 
NO I DON'T THINK IT SCARRED ME UNDULY I HAD A WONDERFUL MOTHER 
MY BROTHER WAS AWAY IN THE MERCHANT NAVY 
NINE YEARS OLDER AND IT WAS ME AND MY MUM AND SHE DID A GREAT JOB 
THEN WHEN I JUST TOOK OFF AND LEFT HOME AND WENT ON TOUR AND EVERYTHING 
NOT A WORD OR RECRIMINATION OR ANYTHING TOTALLY SUPPORTIVE 
WHAT SHE WAS THINKING IS ANOTHER MATTER BECAUSE SHE WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS THAT MIDDLE CLASS THING 
THEN I HEARD SHE WAS TALKING TO THE AUNTIES AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY 
ABOUT WHAT I WAS DOING AND EVERYTHING BUT WHEN I WAS DOING IT 
SHE DIDN'T TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT EITHER 
SHE CAME TO SEE ME WHEN I DID MY VERY FIRST PAID JOB 
AT THE CITY VARIETY THEATRE IN LEEDS THERE WAS A PATTERN EMERGING 
THAT WAS ALSO IN THOSE DAYS THE HOME OF STRIPPERS NO DECENT LEEDS WOMAN WOULD BE SEEN IN THERE 
IT WAS ALL RAINCOATS SALES REPS AND COMMERCIAL TRAVELLERS 
I WAS LIVING AT HOME AND COMING HOME AND HAVING SUPPER EVERY NIGHT 
AND SHE NEVER MENTIONED IT OR HOW'S IT GONE 
I GAVE UP BY ABOUT WEDNESDAY AND ON THE FRIDAY NIGHT I CAME HOME AND HAD SUPPER AND SHE CLEARED THE TABLE 
AND WALKED AWAY INTO THE KITCHEN AND SAID THE SUIT LOOKED NICE 
I SUDDENLY REALISED SHE'D BEEN IN SHE'D CREPT IN 
TO THE THEATRE THAT NIGHT THEY TOLD ME THE NEXT DAY 
THAT SHE'D BEEN LURKING IN THE ALLEYWAY NEAR THE BOX OFFICE 
AND BEEN TAKEN IN THEY REFUSED TO SELL HER A TICKET 
THE WOMAN IN THE BOX OFFICE SAID I KNEW IT WAS YOUR MOTHER 
SHE SAW ME APPARENTLY AND THEN FLED INTO THE NIGHT 
I WAS VERY TOUCHED BY THAT BUT THERE'D BEEN NO REFERENCE TO THIS ALL WEEK 
I WONDERED READING IN THE MEMOIRS AND HAVING HEARD YOU ON THE RADIO AND SEEN YOU IN STAGE SHOWS 
SOMETHING YOU DO A LOT WHICH YOU ADMIT IS THE DIGRESSION THAT YOU START OFF ON A SUBJECT OFTEN QUITE 
A SERIOUS ONE AND THEN INSTANTLY YOU GO FOR A JOKE A STORY OR WHATEVER 
AND I WONDERED IF THAT WAS PERHAPS CONNECTED WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU IN CHILDHOOD 
YEAH I'VE BEEN 
I'VE BEEN ACCUSED 
QUITE WARMLY BY FRIENDS AND PEOPLE OF ALWAYS SIDESTEPPING ISSUES 
WITH A JOKE AS WELL AT ENTIRELY THE WRONG MOMENT OFTEN 
THERE IS A COMPULSION IN ME IT'S A SORT OF 
IT'S A BIT I'M NOT BEING FLIPPANT ABOUT THIS SUBJECT 
BUT IT'S A BIT LIKE TOURETTE'S SYNDROME INSOFAR AS 
THE JOKE WILL BLURT OUT IF I'M NOT CAREFUL 
ABOUT ALMOST ANYTHING AND THAT IS VERY HEAVY GOING FOR OTHER PEOPLE 
I REALLY DO SYMPATHISE WITH THEM 
AND I TRY AND FIGHT IT BUT NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFULLY 
BUT EVEN IN THE MEMOIRS YOU REVEAL IN A COUPLE OF SENTENCES THAT YOUR FATHER DIED WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG 
AND THEN YOU SAY HE WAS AN ACCOUNTANT AND THEN INSTANTLY YOU GO 
INTO A VERY FUNNY JOKE WHICH WE MUST HAVE 
OH YES AN ACCOUNTANT IS WALKING DOWN THE STREET 
SUDDENLY CONFRONTED BY A POOR OLD TRAMP 
A DOSSER WHO SAID GIVE US A QUID I HAVEN'T EATEN FOR THREE DAYS 
AND THE ACCOUNTANT SAID HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR 
NOW YOU SEE THERE WE GO IMMEDIATELY OH THAT'S IT 
AND PEOPLE SAY TO ME WHY DON'T YOU JUST TALK ON THE STAGE 
I'M RESTLESS I'M LOOKING FOR THE NEXT LAUGH BUT WITH YOUR WIFE 
THIS IS TURNING INTO THE PSYCHIATRIST'S CHAIR IT IS 
I'M JUST INTERESTED BECAUSE 
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED A LONG TIME YOU'VE GOT SEVERAL CHILDREN 
FOUR YEAH IN THAT TIME THERE ARE SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE TO BE HAD DO YOU DO THAT THEN 
DOES YOUR WIFE END UP SCREAMING WILL YOU PLEASE JUST BE SERIOUS FOR A MINUTE 
OH YES AND THAT FAMILY HAVE DONE IT WHEN THEY'RE GROWING UP 
YEAH YEAH ALL RIGHT DAD YEAH 
GET THE JOKE OUT OF THE WAY NOW THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
LEEDS GRAMMAR SCHOOL WHICH IS WHERE YOU WENT 
THE PERFORMING IT DID HAPPEN THERE BECAUSE YOU WON AN ACTING CUP 
I SHARED AN ACTING CUP WITH MY FRIEND JOHN GLEDHILL HE PLAYED HAL AND I PLAYED FALSTAFF 
I HAD A MASSIVE BOLSTER YOU KNOW BIG PILLOW IN WHICH FELL OUT REGULARLY IN PERFORMANCES 
COVERED IN TALCUM POWDER WIG AND EVERYTHING AND I REMEMBER 
THE THEN PRINCESS ROYAL PRESENTED IT TO US AND IT DETACHED FROM ITS LITTLE PLINTH 
I GAVE HIM THE PLINTH AND KEPT THE CUP 
AND GOT A LAUGH OH DEAR 
PROBABLY THAT SOWED SEEDS OR SOMETHING 
HAVING PLAYED FALSTAFF LITERATURE WAS A BIG THING FOR YOU BECAUSE 
WHEN YOU WENT TO UNIVERSITY YOU READ ENGLISH LITERATURE 
YES I'M B. A. FAILED BECAUSE THEY KICKED YOU OUT 
YES I WAS TOO BUSY RUNNING AROUND DOING OTHER THINGS 
ALSO I FAILED DUE TO THE OUTBREAK OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
WHICH WAS SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE BUT UPSET ME VERY DEEPLY THERE WE GO 
WHICH IS ONE OF YOUR DIVERSIONARY JOKES INDEED 
NO MY FIRST YEAR RESULTS REALLY SHOWED 
THAT I'D BEEN IN THE BAR AND CHASING GIRLS AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS 
YOU KNOW PLUS C. A. CHANGE BUT I WASN'T PROUD OF THAT 
BLUE EYES GOT TO UNIVERSITY AND BLEW IT I REALLY FELT ASHAMED 
THAT I'D LET PEOPLE DOWN AND MY MUM HAD BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE AND EVERYTHING 
BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN IF I HADN'T BEEN AT UNIVERSITY A GUY CAME UP 
TO SEE SOMEBODY IN A STUDENT SHOW NOT ME 
AND SAW ME TELLING JOKES AND OFFERED ME WORK SO I THINK IT ACCELERATED 
THE PROCESS I THINK I'D HAVE PROBABLY FINISHED UP DOING WHAT I DO ANYWAY PERHAPS 
IN THAT LEEDS UNIVERSITY STAGE REVUE IF ONLY WE HAD 
TAPES OF IT THERE WERE THREE PERFORMERS IN THERE 
ONE OF THEM WENT ON TO WIN THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE 
ANOTHER TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST ADMIRED POETS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS YOU 
YES TONY HARRISON 
THE POET AND WOLE SOYINKA A GREAT MAN WHO WON THE NOBEL 
AND WAS IMPRISONED DURING THE WAR IN WHAT WAS NIGERIA DO YOU HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH HIM 
THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF PHONE CALLS THROUGH THE YEARS 
HE DID A REITH LECTURE A YEAR OR SO AGO AND I COULDN'T GET TO THAT 
I'D HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN HIM HE'S A REALLY PATRIARCHAL FIGURE NOW WITH THE WHITE HAIR 
AND THE BEARD AND EVERYTHING HE LOOKS MAGNIFICENT NOW 
AND I'M TRYING TO GET IN TOUCH WITH TONY HARRISON AGAIN 
IT COMES ROUND WHEN YOU GET TO A CERTAIN AGE YOU START 
HUDDLING TOGETHER FOR WARMTH YOUR CONTEMPORARIES 
I INTERVIEWED TONY HARRISON RECENTLY FOR HIS SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY FOR B. B. C. RADIO FOUR I HEARD IT 
SOMETHING SURPRISING HAPPENED WE WERE TALKING ABOUT POETRY 
AND I ASKED HIM IF HE WROTE POETRY AT UNIVERSITY AND HE SAID 
NO THE GREAT POET AT UNIVERSITY WAS BARRY CRYER 
AND HE RECITED THIS POEM FROM MEMORY 
YES TONY WAS EDITING A MAGAZINE AND HE PUT IT IN THE MAGAZINE 
I FORGOTTEN I'D WRITTEN IT IT'S QUITE SHORT 
LOTS BECAME NATURALLY RATHER PEEVED WHEN HIS SEX LIFE CAME TO A HALT 
WELL WOULDN'T YOU IF YOU HAD TO MAKE DO WITH OCCASIONAL PINCHES OF SALT 
I WAS VERY TOUCHED TONY REMEMBERED IT 
YES VERBATIM SO YOU GOT KICKED OUT BUT YOU DON'T REGRET IT 
IT WAS FALL OR PUSH TIME IT'S A LONG TIME AGO MARK 
I THINK I WAS OFFERED A COUPLE OF RETAKES 
I THINK I COULD HAVE SORT OF SCRAMBLED BACK IN BUT BY THEN 
EVENTS WERE TAKING OVER AND I WAS ON TOUR 
IN SHOWS CALLED FANNY GET YOUR FUN AND WE'VE NOTHING ON TONIGHT 
SELF EXPLANATORY I THINK 
BECAUSE OF YOUR BACKGROUND UNIVERSITY I SUPPOSE AS WELL 
IN SHOWBIZ IN THE EARLY YEARS YOU WERE KNOWN AS TOFF 
WELL YES THE STAGE CREW AT THE EMPIRE BECAUSE I MADE A FALSE START 
IN THE BUSINESS AND WENT BACK TO LEEDS TAIL BETWEEN MY LEGS 
WENT BACK TO THE THEATRE WHERE 
I'D BEEN JUMPING ABOUT SHOWING OFF AS A STUDENT 
A GREAT MAN CALLED JOHNNY GUMM A STAGE MANAGER 
A VERY BULKY SCOT HE WAS A GOOD MAN 
AND HE GOT ME A JOB AS A STAGE HAND IN THE MORNING I EMPTIED THREE BARS 
THE BOTTLES AND ALL THAT AND I CAN ASSURE YOU EMPTIES ARE HEAVY 
NO LIFTS STALLS CIRCLE GALLERY 
THEN I'D GO HOME FOR A REST AND THEN I'D COME BACK AT NIGHT 
AND BE A STAGE HAND AND I'D BEEN AT UNIVERSITY SO 
IT WAS QUITE AFFECTIONATE THEY JUST CALLED ME TOFF THE REST OF THE LADS 
I HAD A GOOD TIME THERE 
YOU MET THE MOST AMAZING PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW 
BAND CALL ON A MONDAY MORNING WHEN EVERYBODY ARRIVED TO REHEARSE 
AND I WAS HOVERING ABOUT WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING 
TRYING TO GET CLOSE TO MAX WALL AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT 
THAT WAS A GREAT PERIOD 
IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME WHEN WE GET YOU TO LONDON BUT IT WAS 
STRIPPERS ALWAYS IT WAS COMEDY AND STRIPPING 
BECAUSE MY FIRST JOBS AFTER LEAVING UNIVERSITY WERE IN STRIP SHOWS 
DAVID NIXON HAD BECOME MY MENTOR BECAUSE I WAS HIS ASSISTANT WHEN HE DID A PANTOMIME IN LEEDS 
NOT ON STAGE HIS DRESSER AND EVERYTHING 
WE BECAME FRIENDS AND HE GAVE ME HIS PHONE NUMBER 
AND I WENT TO LONDON WITH THIS SEVENTEEN DAY TICKET 
DAVID INVITED ME TO HIS SHOWS INTRODUCED ME TO PEOPLE 
BUT WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO IN SEVENTEEN DAYS 
AND THE DAY BEFORE THE TICKET RAN OUT 
I GOT AN AUDITION AT THE WINDMILL THEY USED TO DO AUDITIONS ABOUT 
TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE FIRST SHOW WAS AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
AND I WENT ON AND TOLD SOME JOKES AND SANG A SONG 
AND A VOICE FROM THE DARKNESS WHICH OBVIOUSLY LATER WAS THE BOSS 
VIVIAN VAN DAMME A FORMIDABLE MAN KNOWN TO US ALL AS V. D. 
AND THIS VOICE SAID DO YOU KNOW ANY MORE JOKES 
AND I SAID YES AND TOLD A COUPLE MORE 
KNOW ANOTHER SONG YES BUT I HAVEN'T BROUGHT THE MUSIC RONNIE'LL HELP 
RONNIE BRIDGES THE PIANIST BECAME A FRIEND SO HE BUSKED A SONG FOR ME AND THEN I WAS IN A STATE OF SHOCK 
I WAS TAKEN AWAY OFF THE STAGE 
AND TOLD DRESSING ROOM TWELVE A AND INFORMED THAT I WAS IN THE SHOW 
FOR THAT DAY THAT DAY 
VAN DAMME WAS AN AMAZING MAN HE PUT ME IN HE DIDN'T CUT ANYBODY FROM THE SHOW OR WHATEVER 
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DID IT BUT HE SHOVED ME IN AS BOTTOM OF THE BILL 
AND I WAS ON STAGE AT ABOUT HALF PAST TWELVE 
THEN I WAS CALLED TO THE OLD MAN'S OFFICE BETWEEN EVERY SHOW THAT DAY 
THEY WERE SIX TIMES A DAY 
YEAH SO THE FIVE GAPS BETWEEN THE SHOWS I WAS IN HIS OFFICE BETWEEN THE DESK AND THE FISH TANK DO IT 
AND I HAD TO DO IT DON'T LIKE THAT JOKE THAT ONE'S GOOD YOU'RE DOING IT TOO EARLY MOVE IT TO THE END 
IT WAS LIKE A MASTER CLASS HE PRACTICALLY CHANGED MY ACT IN ONE DAY 
JUST AMAZING THEN I RANG MY MUM AND SHE'D NO CONCEPT OF WHAT A WINDMILL COMEDIAN WAS 
AND THAT WAS IT I WAS THROWN IN THE DEEP END AND I MET A MAN CALLED BRUCE FORSYTH 
I NEVER FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM BRUCE WAS THERE YOU SAY IN THE MEMOIRS BRUCIE 
WE MIGHT NEVER HAVE KNOWN WHAT HAPPENED TO BRUCIE BECAUSE HE ALMOST GAVE UP YES HE DID 
WE WERE TALKING ONE DAY BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY IN THAT WORLD OF THE WINDMILL A REAL INSTITUTION 
VERY WELL KNOWN HE HAD HIS NAME ON THE HONOURS BOARDS OUTSIDE WHEN HE WAS STILL THERE AND BRUCE SAID TO ME 
I'VE GOT AS FAR AS I'LL GET I'VE GOT TO PACK IT IN I SAID WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO 
HE SAID OPEN A LITTLE SHOP A TOBACCONIST'S 
AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT 
I READ THAT HE WAS THE NEW COMPERE OF SUNDAY NIGHT AT THE LONDON PALLADIUM 
AND I THINK IT WAS KINGSWAY IN LONDON I BUMPED INTO BRUCE HE'D JUST BEEN TO A PRESS CONFERENCE 
FOR THE NEXT SUNDAY LIVE MILLIONS OF VIEWERS AND EVERYTHING AND I CONGRATULATED HIM 
I SAID WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE TOBACCONIST'S HE SAID POSTONED 
IT'S BEEN POSTPONED FOR FIFTY YEARS NOW 
V. D. VAN DAMME WHO HAD BEEN YOUR GREAT CHAMPION IN LONDON 
HAVING BEEN VERY GOOD TO YOU HE THEN JUST CUT YOU OFF 
YEAH BUT LOOKING BACK I KNOW WHAT HE WAS ON ABOUT 
YOU'D SERVED YOUR APPRENTICESHIP HE WANTED TO SEE HOW YOU GOT ON HE WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN 
WHAT HAPPENED TO PEOPLE AFTER THEY LEFT THE THEATRE 
AND IT WAS QUITE DEVASTATING AT THE TIME BECAUSE I THINK I WAS PROBABLY GETTING COMPLACENT 
BUT HE ALWAYS KEPT YOU ON YOUR TOES BECAUSE THE SHOWS WOULD RUN 
I CAN'T REMEMBER NOW THREE WEEKS OR FOUR WEEKS BUT TOWARDS THE END HE WOULD SAY I WANT A NEW ACT 
AND YOU'D GO IN AND AUDITION A NEW ACT FOR HIM IN THE MORNING 
AND HE'D OFTEN TURN YOU DOWN BUT HE'D SAY COME AGAIN TOMORROW 
ONE WEEK I THOUGHT THIS IS IT I'M OUT OF WORK AND I AUDITIONED 
THREE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WEEK AND ON THE THIRD DAY HE SAID 
COME ON SUNDAY WHICH IS SHORTHAND THE DRESS REHEARSAL FOR THE NEW SHOW IS STILL WORKING 
THEN HE SAID TO ME ONE DAY WELL THAT'S IT I WISH YOU ALL THE VERY BEST OF LUCK 
IT'S TIME TO GO OUT INTO THE WICKED WORLD 
AND I THOUGHT HE'S SACKING ME HE'S DROPPING ME BUT LOOKING BACK 
AND I'VE COMPARED NOTES WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO WORKED THERE 
HE'D SORT OF GROOM YOU THROUGH 
AND GIVE YOU THE TRAINING AND THE EXPERIENCE AND THEN 
THROW YOU OUT INTO THE WORLD AND SEE HOW YOU GOT ON THEN YOU HAD THIS MUSICAL INTERLUDE 
WHEN YOU WERE IN A WEST END MUSICAL EXPRESSO BONGO 
BUT THEN EVEN MORE IMPROBABLY HAD A NUMBER ONE HIT IN FINLAND 
YES ANOTHER MENTOR AND GOOD FRIEND WAS FRANKIE VAUGHAN THE SINGER AND HE RECORDED FOR PHILIPS RECORDS 
AND I WAS A BOTTOM OF THE BILL COMIC 
AND PAUL CAVE FRANK'S MANAGER TOOK ME OVER BUT I WAS OUT OF WORK MORE THAN IN 
SO PAUL HAD ME WORKING IN THE OFFICE ANSWERING FAN MAIL AND MAKING THE TEA AND EVERYTHING 
AND LOOKING BACK AGAIN I GET A BIT EMBARRASSED BECAUSE IT WAS OBVIOUS THEY WERE JUST KEEPING FRANK HAPPY 
THEY GOT ME AN AUDITION WITH FONTANA RECORDS A SUBSIDIARY OF PHILIPS AND FRANK CAME WITH ME TO THE AUDITION 
LOOKING BACK THEY MUST HAVE BEEN GOING OH BOY HERE'S FRANK'S PROTEGE THEY'VE OPENED ANOTHER CAN 
WHERE'VE THEY FOUND THIS ONE 
I GOT A LITTLE CONTRACT THREE RECORDS WITH AN OPTION WHICH WAS NEVER TAKEN UP 
MY FIRST RECORD WAS 
A LITTLE COVER OF 
THE PURPLE PEOPLE EATER BY SHEB WOOLEY COUNTRY SINGER AND ACTOR 
IT WAS THE SORT OF E. T. OF ITS DAY ABOUT A PURPLE PEOPLE EATER THAT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE 
MASSIVE HIT IN AMERICA QUITE A HIT HERE BUT I THINK FOR CONTRACTUAL REASONS OR SOMETHING 
IT WASN'T ISSUED IN SCANDINAVIA AND THEY PUSHED OUT MY LITTLE ENGLISH COVER VERSION 
WELL I SAW THE THING COMING OUT OF THE SKY 
IT HAD A ONE LONG HORN AND ONE BIG EYE 
I COMMENCED TO SHAKIN' AND I SAID HOO WEE 
IT LOOKS LIKE A PURPLE PEOPLE EATER TO ME 
AND THEN I GOT A CALL YOU'RE NUMBER ONE IN FINLAND 
FOR THREE WEEKS I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT CAN YOU GIVE US A QUICK BURST 
OH WHAT 
I SHALL DECLAIM IT 
I SAW THE THING COMING OUT OF THE SKY 
IT HAD A ONE LONG HORN AND ONE BIG EYE 
I COMMENCED TO SHAKIN' AND I SAID HOO WEE 
IT LOOKS LIKE A PURPLE PEOPLE EATER TO ME 
NO MORE MARK PLEASE DON'T INFLICT IT ON ME TREMENDOUS 
AROUND THIS TIME A KEY EVENT WAS GETTING MARRIED 
THERE'S A VERY ODD LITTLE REFERENCE IN THE MEMOIRS THAT 
YOU WROTE YOUR WIFE A POEM CALLED THAT OLD WHITE MAGIC 
NO I WROTE A LYRIC FOR HER TO SING ABOUT THE JOYS OF COCAINE 
YES I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT DRUGS BUT THERE WE GO AGAIN THE FEEBLE PUN 
WRITE A PARODY OF THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC CALLED THAT OLD WHITE MAGIC 
AND AT THE TIME I WAS HAVING A PRETTY ROUGH TIME WITH THE SKIN AND EVERYTHING AND 
THIS VISION WITH A STIFF NECK AND A SCARF AND DARK GLASSES 
WHO'D WRITTEN A LYRIC ENTITLED THAT OLD WHITE MAGIC 
SHE SAID THE FIRST IMPRESSIONS WERE NOT GOOD WE TALKED AT THE BEGINNING ABOUT THIS CLICHE OF THE PAIN 
BENEATH THE JOKES THERE WAS LITERAL PAIN FOR YOU AS YOU SUGGEST AS YOU HAD REALLY VERY SEVERE ECZEMA 
YEAH I WAS IN HOSPITAL TWELVE TIMES IN EIGHT YEARS TWICE ON A STRETCHER 
AND ONCE BANDAGED HEAD TO FOOT DARK GLASSES AND GLOVES I'M THE INVISIBLE MAN 
YEARS AGO AT SAINT JAMES'S HOSPITAL LEEDS A MAN HANGED HIMSELF 
SKIN WARD SHEER DESPERATION AND THE MISERY HE WAS GOING THROUGH 
IT'S MUCH BETTER CONTROLLED NOW THAN IT USED TO BE WITH THE CORTISONE BASED TREATMENTS 
AND EVERYTHING IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS HEAVY TAR AND YOUR HANDS ALWAYS LOOKED AS IF 
YOU HADN'T WASHED FOR AGES IT WAS 
AN AMAZING PERIOD WHEN I WAS THE INVISIBLE MAN 
I WAS IN OUTPATIENTS' AND I JUST WALKED OUT OF THE HOSPITAL AND DOWN THE STREET 
JUST TO SEE IF ANYBODY WOULD LOOK AND YOU DON'T SEE ANYBODY LOOKING 
THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT IT WAS A STUNT FOR SOME PROMOTION OR SOMETHING 
I TURNED ROUND AT ONE POINT AND SAW A LITTLE BOY GOING LIKE THAT AND HIS MOTHER GOING 
AND THEN I WENT IN TO A TOBACCONIST 
THIS VISION WALKS IN AND THIS WOMAN LOOKED AT ME 
AND I SAID TWENTY OF WHATEVER TO BUY SOME CIGARETTES AND SHE SAID TURNED OUT NICE TODAY LOVE HASN'T IT 
AND THAT WAS IT I WALKED OUT OF THE SHOP 
AND WAS THERE EVER ANY SUGGESTION OF WHERE IT CAME FROM THE ECZEMA 
YOU CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR YOURSELF SUBJECTIVELY 
I THINK THERE WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL ROOT BECAUSE 
AFTER MEETING MY WIFE AND THEN WE HAD FOUR CHILDREN 
AND WHAT A DAY THAT WAS SEE CAN'T STOP 
NO SERIOUSLY THE SKIN HAS INCREASINGLY GOT BETTER THROUGH THE YEARS 
THAT I'VE BEEN WITH HER SO I THINK SHE SHOULD BE ON PRESCRIPTION 
IT CAN'T BE A COINCIDENCE IT'S SO MARKED THAT THE PERIOD WHEN MY SKIN 
STARTED GETTING BETTER WAS AFTER I MET HER 
AND SHE ENDED A RUN OF BAD LUCK WITH WOMEN BECAUSE ALTHOUGH YOU WERE SURROUNDED BY STRIPPERS 
YOU HAD THIS ABILITY TO PICK THE LESBIANS YES I BEGAN TO THINK THAT SEXUALLY 
I WAS A SORT OF FRIDGE MAGNET UNERRING TOUCH BUT THE WRONG ONE 
AH CHARLOTTE OH I'M GOING ALL DREAMY NOW ABOUT CHARLOTTE 
CHARLOTTE PALMER 
ARE YOU WATCHING THIS CHARLOTTE WHERE ARE YOU 
I FELL VIOLENTLY IN LOVE WITH CHARLOTTE PALMER 
AND I USED TO DO A COMMENTARY FOR HER ACT THERE'D BEEN A CARDBOARD EIFFEL TOWER ON THE STAGE 
AND I WOULD STAND ON THE SIDE GOING NOW DESIREE TAKES US TO PARIS 
AND THE MANAGEMENT WOULDN'T PAY ME EXTRA FOR THAT 
SO SHE GAVE ME TWENTY PLAYERS EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT YOU SAY THINGS GOT BETTER WHEN YOU MET YOUR WIFE 
YOU WERE PRETTY MISERABLE AT ONE POINT BEFORE THAT WEREN'T YOU WELL IT WAS A CLICHE 
IT WAS BED SITTER MISERY YOU KNOW IN AND OUT OF HOSPITAL BEDSITS OUT OF WORK 
THE UPSIDE THE POSITIVE SIDE WAS YOU MADE SO MANY FRIENDS VERY QUICKLY 
BECAUSE SO MANY OF YOU WERE OUT OF WORK AND YOU WOULD MEET AT WHAT WE THEN CALLED THE LABOUR EXCHANGE 
JOB CENTRE AND YOU DID MAKE FRIENDS QUITE QUICKLY YOU WERE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT AND YOU'D NURSE 
A CUP OF TEA FOR TWO HOURS IN THE TEA SHOP OR HALF A PINT IN A PUB AND JUST TALK AND LAUGH 
AND I'VE GOT FRIENDS TO THIS DAY I MET DURING THAT PERIOD YOUR CAREER REALLY TOOK OFF 
FIRST OF ALL WITH WRITING COMEDY FOR VARIOUS PEOPLE DANNY LA RUE DAVID FROST KENNY EVERETT 
MORECAMBE AND WISE AND SO ON TOMMY COOPER COULD YOU ADAPT ANY JOKE TO ANY PERFORMER 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SAME JOKE BUT YOU COULD WRITE A SKETCH OR A ROUTINE IN FIVE DIFFERENT WAYS 
FOR FIVE DIFFERENT COMEDIANS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT HE WOULDN'T DO IT LIKE HIM OR HER 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THE GOOD ONES HAVE ALL GOT SUCH INDIVIDUALITY THAT YOU'VE GOT TO TAILOR IT FOR THEM 
THE OTHER THING WAS AFTER THE EARLY DAYS I NEVER WROTE ALONE 
I ALWAYS WROTE IN PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE IF YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN AND YOU HAVE A MENTAL BLOCK 
AND IT WON'T HAPPEN YOU'RE IN A BIT OF TROUBLE BUT IF THERE'S TWO OF YOU 
OR EVEN THREE OF YOU WITH SOME SHOWS YOU START BATTING IDEAS AROUND AND SOMETHING'S LIABLE TO HAPPEN 
JOHN JUNKIN THE LATE JOHN JUNKIN AND I WROTE A LOT FOR ERIC AND ERNIE 
AND JOHN DID A MARVELLOUS ERIC MORECAMBE 
DENNIS NORDEN ALWAYS SAYS THERE'S A SITTER AND A PACER THERE'S SOMEONE 
TYPING AND THERE'S SOMEONE WALKING ABOUT AND I WOULD SIT THERE 
SCRIBBLING OR TYPING AND JOHN WOULD WALK AROUND WAGGLING HIS GLASSES AND YOU GOT THE FEEL 
YOU'VE GOT TO HEAR THEIR VOICES IN YOUR HEAD AND SEE THE WAY THEY 
MOVE THE WHOLE THING 
AND PRESUMABLY PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY WILL TURN MATERIAL DOWN THEY'LL SAY THAT DOESN'T WORK 
OR THAT'S NOT FUNNY OH YEAH I ALWAYS SAID ERIC AND ERNIE PARTICULARLY ERIC 
WERE NOT EASY TO WRITE FOR AND I MEANT THAT AS A COMPLIMENT 
ERIC PARTICULARLY WAS THE SCRIPT VETTER AND HE KNEW HE HAD A WONDERFUL INSTINCT 
AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD SAY THIS IS FUNNY BUT IT'S NOT US 
WHEREAS KENNY EVERETT WHO WASN'T A COMEDIAN THE ONLY NON COMEDIAN 
I EVER WROTE FOR HE WAS KENNY EVERETT SO HE HAD NO PRECONCEIVED IDEAS OF WHAT HE DID 
A GOOD COMIC WILL SAY THAT'S FUNNY BUT IT'S NOT ME KENNY WOULD JUST GO OOH 
AND HAVE A GO AT IT HE WAS A NATURAL BUT HE WASN'T A COMEDIAN PER SE 
WOULD YOU EVER GET ANNOYED THAT IT WAS THEM DOING IT RATHER THAN YOU 
WAS THERE ANY RESENTMENT NO NEVER 
I'VE OFTEN BEEN ASKED THAT MARK I'M JUST A BACKROOM BOY THAT'S WHAT I DO 
AND IF YOU ARE WRITING FOR SOMEONE AS GOOD AS 
ERIC AND ERNIE OR THE TWO RONNIES OR TOMMY OR FRANKIE HOWERD 
THEY BRING SOMETHING TO IT 
WHATEVER THEY DO THAT MAKES IT SEEM BETTER THAN IT WAS PROBABLY 
THEY BRING THEMSELVES TO BEAR ON IT AND YOU GET A BIT MORE CREDIT THAN MAYBE YOU EVEN DESERVE 
BECAUSE YOU'RE WRITING FOR SOMEBODY GOOD AND VIEWERS WHEN THEY LOOK AT DOUBLE ACTS IN COMEDY 
THEY TEND TO THINK ONE IS THE REALLY FUNNY ONE SO PEOPLE WOULD SAY ERIC MORECAMBE 
RONNIE BARKER THEY WERE THE REALLY FUNNY ONES DID YOU THINK THAT AS WRITERS 
NO NO WE ALWAYS ADMIRED AND I'VE DONE A LOT OF IT MYSELF WE ALWAYS ADMIRED THE FEED 
HE OR SHE IS THE ROCK UPON WHICH THE SEA OF HUMOUR BREAKS MARK 
NO THE FEEDING IS AN ART AND 
ERIC SAID VERY AFFECTIONATELY ABOUT ERNIE HE HAD THIS CRUEL STREAK 
HE SAID OH HE'S NOT THE BEST STRAIGHT MAN IN THE WORLD BUT HE'S THE BEST ONE I'LL EVER HAVE 
BECAUSE THEY JUST WERE LIKE THAT 
JUST LIKE TELEPATHY ERIC WAS SUCH A PERFECTIONIST 
AND HE WOULD REHEARSE ADLIBS AND HE KNEW EVERY WORD AND EVERY SYLLABLE 
HE USED TO GET IRRITATED WITH ERNIE WHO WAS A SLOWER LEARNER 
AND WAS STILL READING THE SCRIPT AND ERIC HAD IT JUST LIKE THAT BUT EVEN THE GREAT MORECAMBE HE'S TALKING 
ABOUT THE BOSSES AT THE B. B. C. AND HE SAYS TO ERNIE OH THERE THEY ARE WALKING DOWN THE POWERS OF CORRIDOR 
AND ERNIE JUST LIKE THAT SAID PARDON HE SAID BACKWARDS OF COURSE 
IT WAS THE SPEED HE WAS ANNOYED WITH HIMSELF FOR THAT STRANGE 
SPOONERISM OR TRANSPOSITION BUT THAT WAS THE SPEED OF THE REACTION 
BACKWARDS OF COURSE 
SOMEONE YOU DIDN'T WRITE FOR BUT MET WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL ENVY YOU IS GROUCHO MARX 
OH YES I MET HIM THE ONCE 
HE WAS OVER IN ELSTREE DOING THE MARTY FELDMAN SHOW MARTY FELDMAN COMEDY MACHINE 
I HAD A COPY OF THE GROUCHO LETTERS AND THERE WAS A WRITER CALLED BARRY AN AMERICAN AND WE USED TO MEET 
AND HAVE A DRINK A LOT AND GOT ON VERY WELL WHO I LATER FOUND OUT WAS BARRY LEVINSON 
NOT UNKNOWN AS A BIG TIME DIRECTOR 
FILM DIRECTOR YEAH AND WE HIT IT OFF AND THAT WAS GREAT 
AND GROUCHO MARX WAS IN THE RESTAURANT AT ELSTREE OVER THERE WITH LARRY GELBART 
AND BARRY LEVINSON SAID TO ME WHAT'S THE BOOK 
AND I SAID THE GROUCHO LETTERS I SAID IF THERE'S A MOMENT IF NOT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN 
IF THERE'S A MOMENT I'D LOVE IT SIGNED OBVIOUSLY 
SO HE TAKES IT FROM ME I SAID HE'S HAVING HIS LUNCH BARRY AND HE GOES OVER 
TO GROUCHO MARX I'M PRACTICALLY HIDING NOW 
AND BARRY BRINGS THE BOOK BACK TO ME AND BARRY SAID WHAT HE PUT IN IT I DIDN'T SEE 
AND HE'D JUST PUT BY GROUCHO 
SO BARRY SAID DO YOU WANT IT PERSONALISING 
I SAID NO AND HE WENT BACK AGAIN 
NOW I AM HIDING I'VE GONE BEHIND A PILLAR NOW 
AND APPARENTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS BARRY LEVISON SAID COULD YOU PUT TO BARRY 
AND THEN FOR SOME REASON WHICH SOUNDS SO INSULTING WOULD YOU PUT MARX 
AS IF HOW MANY GROUCHOS AND HE PUT MARX IN THE WRONG PLACE 
I'VE GOT A COPY OF THE GROUCHO LETTERS TO BARRY MARX FROM GROUCHO MARX 
HE TREATED ME LIKE A BROTHER 
AMERICAN COMEDY WRITING THE BIG TRADITION THERE IS THE WRITERS' ROOM WHICH WE'RE SEEING AT THE MOMENT 
IN STUDIO SIXTY ON THE SUNSET STRIP BUT WE'VE SEEN IN MANY FILMS 
YES HUGE AMOUNTS OF THEM TOGETHER THAT'S BEEN LESS COMMON IN BRITAIN HASN'T IT 
IT'S VERY OFTEN IN FACT MOST OFTEN IT'S PAIRS WRITING TOGETHER BUT YOU THINK THAT'S BECAUSE 
ONE OF YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE INSPIRATION 
WE'VE NEVER GONE FOR EXCEPTING THE SKETCH SHOWS THE CONTRIBUTORY SHOWS LIKE THE TWO RONNIES AND EVERYTHING 
USED TO CALL IT THE DEAD OF TWO WORLD WARS AS THE WRITING CREDITS CAME UP SO MANY NAMES AND OF COURSE 
CONTRACTUALLY THEY HAD EVERYBODY'S NAME THAT HAD WRITTEN FOR THE WHOLE SERIES 
NOT JUST FOR THAT NIGHT BUT I DIDN'T BLAME ANYBODY AT HOME FOR THINKING IT TOOK TWENTY TWO PEOPLE TO WRITE THAT SHOW 
NO I DON'T THINK TO THIS DAY WE'VE GONE REALLY FOR THE FACTORY PRINCIPAL THE BIG TEAM OF WRITERS 
AND I LOVE THE LONE WOLVES OF COURSE THE GREAT JOHNNY SPEIGHT WHO JUST DID HIS OWN THING 
JOHNNY AND I STARTED WRITING AN HOUR FOR FRANKIE HOWERD 
FRANCIS HOWERD IN CONCERT AND IT WAS SUCH A DISASTER WE STARTED LAUGHING BECAUSE HE WAS A LONE WOLF 
EVERY TIME WE SAT DOWN TOGETHER TO TRY AND WRITE SOMETHING 
WE STARTED DISAGREEING SO WE WROTE THE SHOW TOGETHER SEPARATELY 
WE WROTE HALF EACH GOT TOGETHER AND KNOCKED IT INTO SHAPE BUT 
WE ALWAYS LAUGHED ABOUT THAT HE WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE A PARTNER JOHNNY 
JOHN CLEESE AND I SAT DOWN TO WRITE A SKETCH ONCE FOR THE FROST REPORT 
AND THAT DIDN'T WORK EITHER BECAUSE JOHN WANTED TO GO BACK 
OVER PAGE ONE 
HE WAS METICULOUS IN ALMOST EVERY WORD AND I WANTED TO WRITE THE WHOLE THING IN A WHITE HEAT BURST 
AND THEN THINK NO SCREW IT UP THROW IT IN THE BIN AND START AGAIN THAT'S NOT JOHN'S STYLE AND HIS WASN'T MINE 
IT'S FASCINATING THE SORT OF CHEMISTRY THAT DOESN'T WORK 
AS WELL AS WHAT DOES IF YOU FIND A REAL PARTNER 
THE ETHICS OF IT BECAUSE THE LATE BOB MONKHOUSE WAS AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS OTHER COMEDIANS HAVE BEEN 
AS THE THIEF OF BAD GAGS AND THERE'S ANOTHER PERFORMER WHO WAS KNOWN AS THE BUBONIC PLAGIARIST 
ERM I'VE NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MARK 
DO YOU HAVE RULES ABOUT THAT ABOUT TAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S GAGS OH YEAH THERE ARE CLUB RULES ON THAT 
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN NOW BECAUSE AS WE WERE SAYING IN ANOTHER CONTEXT THE STAND UPS DON'T TELL JOKES PER SE 
BUT IN THE OLD DAYS COMEDIANS WOULD BE KNOWN FOR TELLING PARTICULAR JOKES AND WOULD GET VERY ANNOYED 
IF YOU DID A JOKE THAT THEY DID AND IT NEVER REALLY HAPPENED AS A REAL CONFRONTATION BUT I WOULD HAVE SAID 
TO A COMIC I'M SORRY I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WROTE THAT AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO SAY I DIDN'T IT'S A JOKE 
YOU'D GO I GOT THAT JOKE THE WAY YOU GOT IT I HEARD IT SOMEWHERE I DIDN'T NICK IT FROM YOUR ACT 
THAT WAS THE BIG THING IN THE OLD DAYS THAT'S MY JOKE WELL THERE'S NO SUCH THING JOKES ARE JOKES 
YOU WOULD LAY OFF IF A COMIC WAS VERY WELL KNOWN FOR ONE PARTICULAR JOKE 
BUT IN THE GENERAL CURRENCY THERE'S NO COPYRIGHT ON JOKES 
MATERIAL VERY DIFFERENT YOU NEVER TOUCH ANYBODY ELSE'S MATERIAL PER SE SO WHAT'S THE DISTINCTION 
STUFF THEY'VE WRITTEN FOR THEMSELVES OH THEY'VE WRITTEN FOR THEMSELVES OH JEFFREY ARCHER 
I WENT TO A LUNCH ONCE AND THERE WERE BITS IN MY AFTER DINNER SET OR WHATEVER 
I DO LINKING AND CONTINUITY THE DEAD GIVEAWAY IS THE SEQUENCE 
AND HE DID FIVE MINUTES OF ME 
AND THE GIVEAWAY WAS IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME SEQUENCE AND THE WORDING 
AND I THOUGHT WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT THIS 
IT WAS A LUNCH AND I WAS LEAVING THE HOTEL 
FOOTSTEPS OF FAMOUS NOVELIST 
BARRY HE'D HAVE NEVER GIVEN ME THE TIME OF DAY NORMALLY BARRY DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID 
I CHANGED IT A BIT IN THE MIDDLE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I SAID I'LL SETTLE FOR LUNCH AND NEVER HEARD ANOTHER WORD 
DAVID FROST SOMETHING CAME OUT OF THAT WHICH HAS LEAD IN SOME WAYS TO YOUR PERFORMING CAREER 
BECAUSE HE GOT YOU DOING WARM UP YES I WAS A WRITER ON THE ROSTER 
FOR ANYBODY'S WHO'S NOT BEEN AND DAVID SAID OH YOU'RE DOING THE WARM UP I SAID I CAN'T DO THAT 
HE'D SEEN ME DOING THE CHAIRMAN IN AN OLD TIME MUSICAL OR SOMETHING HE SAID NO I'VE SEEN YOU M. C. ING 
SO THAT OPENED ANOTHER DOOR AND I DID A LOT OF WARM UPS 
AND REALISED THAT YOU DON'T DO YOUR ACT BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T COME TO SEE YOU 
IT'S JUST CHATTING TO THE AUDIENCE AND BEING THE LINK THE LINK BETWEEN THE SHOW AND THE AUDIENCE 
SOME WARM UP MEN MAINLY MEN WOULD REALLY GO TO TOWN 
DOING THEIR ACT AND THEY'D DO BLUE JOKES BEFORE A CLEAN SITCOM 
I'VE HEARD THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE BANNED BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO FUNNY OR TOO BLUE 
YES TOO FUNNY OR TOO BLUE 
THERE'S A LOVELY STORY ABOUT A YOUNG COMIC DOING THE WARM UP AT GRANADA TELEVISION 
YEARS AGO AND HE HAD A COUPLE OF JOKES ABOUT ASTROLOGY 
AND HE SAID TO THE AUDIENCE SHOUT OUT YOUR STAR SIGN I'LL TELL YOU YOUR CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS 
AND A GUY SHOUTED AQUARIUS 
AND HE SAID BIG MOUTH ALWAYS WANTS TO GET IN FIRST YOU SEE HA HA HA 
THE COMIC'S IN THE BAR AFTER WITH THE PRODUCER WHO SAID YOU WERE VERY GOOD I WANT TO USE YOU AGAIN 
HE SAID WELL THANK YOU HE SAID I LOVE THE ASTROLOGY JOKE 
HOW DID YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO SHOUT AQUARIUS 
A LARGE PART OF YOUR CAREER WHICH WOULD HAVE SEEMED UNLIKELY AT THE TIME WHEN THEY STARTED 
WAS A LITTLE RADIO SHOW I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T A CLUE WHICH HAS BECOME A LEGEND IN FACT 
THERE AGAIN THE WORD KEEPS OCCURRING WE DON'T ANALYSE WE'RE JUST VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT 
IT'S THIRTY FIVE YEARS NOW NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO IT WASN'T REGARDED AS SOME GREAT HIT IT WAS A SPIN OFF FROM 
I'M SORRY I'LL READ THAT AGAIN 
AND IT DIDN'T ALL GO WELL IN THE BEGINNING NOBODY SAID THIS IS A NEW HOTTIE THIS IS GOING TO DO WELL 
IT WAS ALMOST SINKING WITHOUT TRACE AT ONE POINT AND THEN IT JUST WENT ON AND ON AND THEN 
WE GOT THE BEST PRODUCER WE'VE EVER HAD JOHN NAISMITH AND HIS INPUT IS AMAZING AND HE REALLY 
REVITALISED THE SHOW 
FINALLY BARRY CAN YOU ANSWER THIS GARDENER'S QUESTION 
WHEN SOWING MY SEEDS 
I FIND MANY OF THE SMALL ONES STICK TO MY HANDS IS THERE AN ANSWER 
IS THERE AN ANSWER PLEASE STOP IT YOU'LL GO DEAF 
IT FEATURES TWO THINGS WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE VERY BEGINNING 
WHICH ARE WORD PLAY WHICH IS A LARGE PART OF IT OH YES 
BUT ALSO FILTH THE SCRIPT IS QUITE ASTONISHINGLY FILTHY 
HUMPH CALLS IT BLUE CHIP FILTH YES 
THAT WONDERFUL PATRIARCHAL AIR AND THAT WONDERFUL BORED AIR LET'S GET THIS OVER AND GO HOME 
AND I'VE BEEN GIVEN THIS TO DO BUT I'M NOT QUITE CLEAR WHAT YOU KNOW 
IT WOULDN'T WORK WITH ANYBODY ELSE AND THE DOUBLE ENTENDRES BAT TRIUMPHANTLY 
THERE'S A STAGE VERSION NOW YOU'RE INTO YOUR SEVENTIES YOU'RE DOING MORE AND MORE 
THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO STAGE SHOWS YOU DO APART FROM THAT ONE ON YOUR OWN AROUND THE COUNTRY 
YEAH NO KNOWLEDGE OF MY LIMITATIONS 
BUT IT'S AN INTERESTING MOVE THOUGH HAVING WRITTEN FOR SO LONG YOU'VE DONE MORE AND MORE PERFORMING 
IT'S GONE FULL CIRCLE I SUPPOSE BECAUSE THE MARKET WAS DRYING UP AS A FREELANCE SKETCH GAG WRITER 
AND I'VE BEEN LUCKY I WAS DOING AFTER DINNERS A BIT 
AND BITS OF TELEVISION THROUGH THE TIME I WAS A WRITER SO I JUST HOPED 
THAT THE PERFORMING WOULD COME BACK AND WHERE'S THE WOOD 
IT HAS NO I'M VERY HAPPY A LOT OF TRAVELLING A LOT OF TOURING BUT I LOVE IT 
AFTER DINNER SPEAKING I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF THEM AND I FIND IT HORRENDOUS 
YOU TOLD ME YOU DID A MARATHON I DID A FOUR AND A HALF HOUR PRIZE GIVING ONCE I CAN'T MATCH THAT 
BUT MORE NERVOUS THAN I'VE GOT ABOUT ANYTHING YOU CAN'T EAT BEFOREHAND 
YOU FINISH AT ABOUT MIDNIGHT AND THEY'VE CLEARED ALL THE DRINK AWAY 
I NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE WANTED TO DO IT BUT YOU ACTUALLY ENJOY IT 
WELL IT'S MY PENSION I SUPPOSE 
AND I CAN ENJOY THE MEAL NOW IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME I SUPPOSE 
I'VE GOT OVER THAT HURDLE I CAN ENJOY THE MEAL YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH THAT BEFORE YOU SPEAK 
THAT'S A DEFINITE 
AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO DENTISTS AND QUANTITY SURVEYORS AND ALL THE REST OF IT 
ARE THERE RULES TO THAT AS TO WHAT EXTENT YOU SHOULD TAILOR IT TO 
YEAH I ALWAYS DO A POEM NOW IT'S EMAIL AND EVERYTHING BUT IN THE OLD DAYS THEY'D SEND YOU A BROCHURE 
AND IT'S JUST RHYMING COUPLETS BUT THAT'S MY SORT OF TRADEMARK AND I FINISH WITH THAT 
AND THEY THINK OH THE OLD MAN KNOWS WHO HE'S TALKING TO TO THE POEM IF IT IS ACCOUNTANTS 
OR QUANTITY SURVEYORS YOU WILL WRITE A POEM YES 
AND WHATEVER THEY THINK OF IT THEY KNOW I DIDN'T DO IT 
THE NIGHT BEFORE SOMEWHERE ELSE IT'S WRITTEN FOR THEM BUT NEVER TELL PLUMBERS PLUMBING JOKES 
AN OLD HAND TIPPED ME OFF HE SAID THEY KNOW THEM ALL THEY KNOW MORE JOKES 
ABOUT THEIR JOB THAN YOU DO AND BETTER ONES 
SO I NEVER DO THAT NEVER DO THAT 
THE GREAT STEVE MARTIN I'VE GOT AN AUDIO TAPE AT HOME OF STEVE MARTIN TELLING A VERY INVOLVED JOKE ABOUT 
TWO PLUMBERS CALLED HARRY AND BILL AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE REACTION FROM THE AUDIENCE AND THEN 
THE PUNCHLINE THE VERY END OF THE JOKE IS HARRY SAID BILL THIS IS A P. SEVENTEEN NOT A K. TWENTY EIGHT 
LONG PAUSE BAFFLED AUDIENCE THEN MARTIN SHOUTED YOU BASTARD YOU TOLD ME THE PLUMBERS WERE IN 
YOU KNOW HE'S TAILORING FOR PLUMBERS WHO AREN'T THERE OH IT'S A VERY ESOTERIC JOKE BUT NO YOU MUSTN'T 
PATRONISE THEM BY TELLING THEM JOKES ABOUT THEIR OWN JOB 
AND HECKLING BECAUSE THEY GET DRUNKER AND DRUNKER IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING 
YEAH I DON'T GET HECKLED IT'S DEPRESSING I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS 
YOU'D LIKE TO BE HECKLED I'M GOING TO TOUR MY OWN HECKLER 
NO I GET TOO MUCH RESPECT NOW AND I DON'T WANT IT IN THAT SENSE 
YOU'RE AN ELDER STATESMAN OF BRITISH COMEDY NOW AM I WELL THAT'S WHY THEY RESPECT YOU 
WELL NO WHEN YOU THINK OF GIANTS LIKE ERIC SYKES 
OR THE GREAT DODDY IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PERFORMING KEN DODD 
OH DODD LOOMS OVER US ALL HE'S WONDERFUL YOU DON'T WANT HIM AS YOUR ACCOUNTANT THOUGH 
IT'S STILL IN HIS ACT HE'S STILL TALKING ABOUT IT THEY KEEP GOING SO LONG 
COMEDIANS AND THEN UNTIL THE VERY END WE KNOW ERIC MORECAMBE DIED ON STAGE THEY DON'T LIKE RETIRING 
NO THE GREAT GEORGE BURNS WAS ONE HUNDRED AND WAS STILL DOING JOBS AND EVERYTHING I THINK 
THEY STILL WANT TO GO ON SOMEWHERE TONIGHT AND MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH 
OR THE BEST ONES ARE REALISTS AND THINK CAN I STILL I HAVEN'T LOST IT HAVE I 
AND THE MONEY AND THE FAME DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING 
IT'S CAN I MAKE THAT AUDIENCE LAUGH TONIGHT HOWEVER OLD THEY ARE AND THAT SIDE OF IT THE EXPECTATION 
THAT YOU WILL MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH YOU MUST GET THAT EVERYONE GETS THAT AND THERE ARE COMEDIANS 
WHO HAVE BECOME VERY VERY ANGRY ABOUT IT THAT THE CAB DRIVER WHO SAYS 
GO ON MAKE ME LAUGH FOR THE NEXT TWENTY MINUTES THE PERSON AT DINNER 
ERIC MORECAMBE USED TO SAY PEOPLE APPROACH WITH ME WITH A GLASSY SMILE ON THEIR FACE 
AND ERIC WAS ACTUALLY A RATHER QUIET MAN 
VERY COURTEOUS IN COMPANY AND WANTED TO TALK ABOUT FOOTBALL OR POLITICS 
OR SEX OR WHATEVER BUT HE SAID PEOPLE COME UP AND SAY 
TWIDDLE THE GLASSES SAY SOMETHING FUNNY HE SAID I DON'T BLAME THEM 
IT GOES WITH THE JOB YOU KNOW I'LL START BEING SILLY 
BUT HE WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN SITTING QUIETLY IN THE CORNER HAVING A CHAT 
NOBODY SAYS TO A PLUMBER IN A PUB I SAW THE JOB YOU DID LAST NIGHT THAT WAS 
WE'RE IN A PROFESSION WHERE PEOPLE FEEL QUITE CHEERFUL ABOUT COMING UP TO YOU 
IN PUBS SAYING I SAW THAT LOAD OF RUBBISH YOU DID LAST NIGHT RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY 
DO YOU PLAN TO KEEP GOING AS LONG AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN WE DON'T RETIRE THE PHONE STOPS RINGING 
IT'S OVER 
NO MY WIFE HAS GIVEN UP SHE SAYS HOW OLD ARE YOU 
NO I ENJOY IT 
MY YOUNG FRIEND MIKE MCINTYRE WHO'S A VERY GOOD STAND UP THE SON OF RAY CAMERON 
WITH WHOM I USED TO WRITE KENNY EVERETT SHOWS ARE YOU FOLLOWING THE PLOT 
MIKE SAID TO ME THE OTHER DAY IN EDINBURGH STILL HUNGRY AREN'T YOU I SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
HE SAID YOU'RE STILL ENJOYING IT I SAID YEAH 
COULDN'T DO IT IF I DIDN'T LIKE IT OH FAKING IT MARK IT WOULD BE EXHAUSTING 
YOU'VE MADE ONE ADJUSTMENT TO AGE WHICH IS 
YOU'VE DISCOVERED YOU'VE GONE FROM STAND UP COMEDY TO SIT DOWN COMEDY MY FRIEND STEVE HAD AN IDEA FOR ME 
THEY GOT THE BIG THRONE CHAIR FROM THE LIBRARY BAR AT THE GILDED BALLOON AND PUT IT ON THE STAGE 
IT JUST LOOMS IT LOOKS LIKE A PAPAL AUDIENCE AND I THOUGHT 
OH BOY IS THIS GOING TO WORK AND YOU'RE NEVER TOO OLD TO LEARN 
I LOVED IT SUDDENLY YOU WEREN'T SORT OF STANDING UP DOING A DOMINATING BIT WITH THE AUDIENCE 
YOU WERE LOOKING AT AN AUDIENCE WHO WERE SITTING DOWN AS WERE YOU 
AND YOU DO ADOPT A MORE CONVERSATIONAL STYLE 
YOU CAN'T GO AT THEM VERY STRONGLY WHEN YOU'RE SITTING DOWN OH IT'S LOVELY 
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO OUT ON A JOKE DESERT ISLAND GAGS WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE JOKE OF ALL 
ONE OF MY FAVOURITES JUST FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS I TOLD IT 
FIFTY YEARS AGO IN A STUDENT SHOW AND I MET SOMEBODY THE OTHER DAY WHO REMEMBERED ME TELLING IT 
A MAN IS DRIVING DOWN A COUNTRY LANE AND HE RAN OVER A COCKEREL AND HE WAS UPSET 
HE WENT TO THE FARMHOUSE AND KNOCKED ON THE DOOR A WOMAN ANSWERED AND HE SAID 
I APPEAR TO HAVE KILLED YOUR COCKEREL I'D LIKE TO REPLACE HIM 
AND SHE SAID PLEASE YOURSELF THE HENS ARE ROUND THE BACK 
BARRY CRYER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MARK
