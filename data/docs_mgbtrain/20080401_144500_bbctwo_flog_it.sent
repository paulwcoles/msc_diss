YES I THINK WE'LL RISE TO THE OCCASION 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A FANTASTIC DAY AND THIS BUILDING 
THAT YOU CAN SEE UP HERE THIS IS WATFORD'S TOWN HALL 
SO LET'S GET THE DOORS OPEN AND GET EVERYBODY INSIDE 
KAREN HI THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOR BRINGING ALONG A LITTLE BIT OF MAUCHLINE WARE 
IS THAT WHAT IT IS THAT'S WHAT IT IS WHY DID YOU BRING IT 
WELL MY DAD DIED AND HE WAS A HOARDER 
WE HAD A ROOM FULL OF STUFF 
WE WERE THROWING EVERYTHING OUT AND I SUDDENLY THOUGHT 
WHY THROW IT OUT LET'S DO SOMETHING WITH IT 
TO MAKE SOME MONEY TO DO THINGS AT HOME 
HOW LONG HAS THIS CLEARING OUT PROCESS TAKEN TWO YEARS 
HE DIED TWO YEARS AGO TWO YEARS AGO YOU'RE STILL DOING IT 
WE'RE STILL SORTING HIS STUFF WE HAVE BOXES OF IT 
SOUNDS LIKE AN IDEAL JOB FOR ME 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME 
I DO ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT 
BUT HE ALWAYS COLLECTED JUNK YOU MAY THINK IT'S JUNK 
BUT YOU'VE BROUGHT ALONG A LITTLE GEM HERE NEVER YES 
CAN YOU REMEMBER YOUR DAD BRINGING STUFF BACK 
YES PEOPLE BROUGHT IT TO MY HOUSE 
MY FATHER WAS THE LOCAL WATCHMAKER AND TAXI DRIVER 
PEOPLE WOULD COME TO THE HOUSE IF THEY WANTED TO GET RID OF STUFF 
OR NEEDED MONEY URGENTLY THEY WOULD BRING HIM JUNK AND HE'D BUY IT 
WHAT A GREAT STORY LET'S GET BACK TO WHAT WE'VE GOT 
THIS IS MAUCHLINE WARE RIGHT 
MAUCHLINE WARE IS SOUVENIR WARE 
IT'S MADE IN MAUCHLINE WHICH IS A SMALL TOWN IN SCOTLAND NEAR AYR 
IT WAS IN PRODUCTION FROM ABOUT THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTIES TO ABOUT THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
ACTUALLY NINETEEN THIRTY THREE WHEN THE FACTORY BURNT DOWN CEASING ALL PRODUCTION 
IT'S JUST A LIGHT WOOD WHICH HAS HAD BURNT DECORATION 
OF VARIOUS SCENES OF BRITAIN AND THE COMMONWEALTH 
THIS ONE HERE IS HELENSBURGH ON THE CLYDE WHAT IS IT 
I'VE NO IDEA WHAT IS THIS STRANGE OVAL CASE IT OPENS HERE 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON WOULD GO IN THERE 
SPECTACLES REALLY YEAH THAT'S WHAT IT IS THAT DOES HELP US TO DATE IT 
RIGHT GLASSES ARE NOT THAT SHAPE ANYMORE 
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN THAT SHAPE FOR SOME TIME 
SO WE CAN DATE IT TO THE EARLY PART OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WERE YOU REALLY GOING TO THROW THIS OUT 
HONESTLY IT WOULD'VE GONE INTO THE SKIP 
I HATE TO THINK WHAT YOU'VE THROWN OUT 
HONESTLY DON'T SAY THAT YOU NEVER KNOW YOU SEE 
MY FATHER WILL BE TURNING IN HIS GRAVE AND HE'LL HAUNT ME FOR EVER 
WELL VALUE WE'RE NOT GOING TO SET THE WORLD ON FIRE 
BUT YOU COULD'VE BEEN THROWING AWAY THIRTY QUID THIRTY QUID 
RIGHT FOR THAT YEAH 
SO IF WE PUT A LOW ESTIMATE OF THIRTY TO FIFTY ON IT O. K. 
NOW I'M AN AUCTIONEER 
AND I WOULDN'T REALLY PUT A RESERVE ON IT UNDER ONE HUNDRED 
BUT YOU THINK IT WOULD SELL I'VE GOT A GOOD IDEA IT'S GOING TO SELL 
I THINK LET THEM PLAY IT BY EAR 
O. K. I'LL DO THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
HELLO BERTIE HELLO DAVID 
YOU'VE BROUGHT A NICE PIECE OF PORCELAIN IN TO SHOW US 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT 
WELL I INHERITED IT FROM MY FRIEND 
IT CAME INTO MY BEING WHEN HE DIED 
I'VE HAD IT EVER SINCE I MUST HAVE HAD IT FOR FORTY YEARS 
FORTY YEARS YES DO YOU LIKE THE PIECE 
I LOVE IT I THINK IT'S GREAT I SHOULD HATE TO SEE IT GO 
BUT I'M EIGHTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE NOW AND TIME'S COMING 
AND I'M NOT MARRIED SO I'VE GOT NO ONE TO LEAVE IT TO REALLY SO 
IT'S A NICE PIECE IT'S WHAT'S GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS PARIAN WARE 
YES OF COURSE THIS WAS A VICTORIAN INVENTION 
BY MINTON AND OTHER MAJOR FACTORIES 
WHERE YOU SIMULATE CARVED MARBLE BUT IN BISQUE PORCELAIN 
IT'S A SOFTER TYPE OF MARBLE IS IT 
NO IT IS PORCELAIN IT IS PORCELAIN 
IT'S MEANT TO SIMULATE CARVED MARBLE 
THE VICTORIANS OF COURSE HAD A LOVE OF ANYTHING CLASSIC 
AND THIS SUBJECT IS THE SORT OF THING YOU'D FIND IN A TYPICAL VICTORIAN 
A RATHER GRAND VICTORIAN HOUSE NOT YOUR AVERAGE SEMI 
THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT WAS RATHER CHEEKY 
BECAUSE THE GIRL IS NOT ONLY HAVING THE VEIL REMOVED 
BUT SHE'S NOT WEARING ANYTHING UNDERNEATH 
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF TITILLATION THERE 
WE'VE GOT THE TITLE OF THE FIGURE HERE 
BRITOMARTIS UNVEILING AMORET THE FAIRY QUEEN 
THE WHOLE THING IS WONDERFULLY MADE 
I THINK IT WAS MADE FOR THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY ONE ART EXHIBITION 
WE'VE GOT THE DESIGNER'S NAME HERE 
JOSEPH PITTS SCULPTURE LONDON ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY ONE 
WHAT I PARTICULARLY LIKE ABOUT THIS AND I'M SURE YOU DO AS WELL 
IS WHEN THE VEIL IS BEING REMOVED 
YOU CAN STILL SEE THE FEATURES OF THE FACE UNDERNEATH YES QUITE 
THAT TECHNICALLY IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE 
THAT'S THE THING THAT ATTRACTED ME WHEN I SAW IT 
HOW MARVELLOUSLY IT WAS DONE 
ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT SHOWS THE QUALITY OF IT 
OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT A REPRESENTATION OF MEDIEVAL TIMES 
WITH A KNIGHT IN ARMOUR 
BUT ALSO YOU'VE GOT THE WONDERFUL SUBJECT OF THIS NAKED WOMAN 
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW AND SEE YEAH 
WE'VE GOT TO BE REALISTIC BERTIE 
THESE TYPE OF THINGS ARE NOT NECESSARILY 
THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER IN TODAY'S MARKET NO 
THEY'RE VERY CLASSICAL AND VICTORIAN 
A FEW YEARS AGO IT PROBABLY WOULD'VE MADE A BIT MORE MONEY 
IN TODAY'S MARKET I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT AN ESTIMATE 
OF AROUND A B. O. U. T. THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED THAT'S FINE WONDERFUL 
WE'LL MEET AGAIN AT THE AUCTION 
AND LET'S HOPE THERE'S A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOUR 
WHO'S GOING TO COME AND WHISK AWAY THE NAKED BEAUTY OF THIS FIGURE 
I HOPE SOMEONE ELSE WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THE PORCELAIN 
MIKE I KNOW WHAT'S IN HERE BY THE SHAPE 
IT'S A CONCERTINA WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE CALL A SQUEEZEBOX 
TELL ME IT'S STORY IS THIS YOURS 
IT IS I BOUGHT IT ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO FROM AN ANTIQUES FAIR 
IT WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF A PILE OF RUBBISH I PAID FIVE FOR IT 
TEN YEARS AGO HAVE YOU LEARNT TO PLAY IT SINCE THEN 
I CAN MAKE NOISE WITH IT CAN YOU I CAN MAKE A NOISE WITH IT AS WELL 
TERRIBLE NOISE I ACTUALLY WENT TO VISIT 
A CONCERTINA MAKER A SQUEEZEBOX MAKER IN WALES 
HE MAKES THEM WITH TRADITIONAL METHODS 
USING ROSEWOOD OR CUBAN MAHOGANY EXACTLY LIKE THIS ONE 
USING SEVEN CARDS CUT OUT FROM A TEMPLATE 
WHICH ARE HELD TOGETHER BY CLOTH AND TAPE WHICH MAKES THE BELLOWS 
IT'S SUCH AN INTERESTING PROCESS WITH METAL REEDS 
I THINK THIS IS A METAL REED ONE ISN'T IT 
THE VALUE IN THESE IS IN THE CRAFTSMANSHIP AND WORKMANSHIP 
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO BUILD THEM 
A NEW ONE TODAY BUILT IN TRADITIONAL METHODS 
IS GOING TO SET YOU BACK AROUND ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WOW 
BUT THEY DO LAST A LIFETIME 
YOU CAN GET THE BELLOWS REFIXED IF THEY DO START TO GIVE 
THIS ONE DATES FROM AROUND THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS IT'S AN EDWARDIAN ONE 
IT'S BEEN WELL LOVED AND WELL USED 
WE'VE GOT BONE BUTTONS HERE 
THESE LITTLE BUTTONS ARE YOUR CHORDS AND YOUR NOTES 
FIVE QUID EH AND IT'S IN NOT BAD CONDITION REALLY 
IT DOES NEED A REVARNISH BUT OTHER THAN THAT 
IT'S MADE IN LONDON BY LACHENAL AND CO 
BUTTONS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
ANYONE THAT COLLECTS THESE WILL ASK HOW MANY BUTTONS HAS IT GOT 
IF IT'S GOT MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD ONE YEAH 
THIS ONE'S GOT THIRTY TWO SO WE'RE LAUGHING 
VALUE WISE 
IF I SAID TO YOU THAT'S POSSIBLY GOING TO MAKE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK COME ON YOU PAID A FIVER FOR IT 
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS WORTH MUCH MORE THAN WHAT I PAID FOR IT O. K. 
SO YOU'D BE HAPPY WITH TEN QUID THEN 
NO YOU WOULDN'T THAT'S A PROFIT IT'S A PROFIT YEAH IT IS 
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET AROUND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOR THIS WOW 
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO GET FOR IT 
BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A VALUATION OF EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S GOING TO DO THE TOP END THAT'S A NICE SURPRISE 
THAT WAS A GOOD DAY'S CAR BOOTING REALLY CERTAINLY WAS 
THE BIG QUESTION IS WHY ARE YOU FLOGGING IT IT SAT IN A CUPBOARD FOR TEN YEARS 
I WAS GOING TO START COLLECTING MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
AND THAT'S THE ONLY ONE I COLLECTED 
SO IT STARTED HERE AND IT'S ENDED HERE IT'S ENDED HERE 
AT LEAST YOU'VE LOOKED AFTER IT 
BY VIRTUE OF HAVING THE BOX IT'S KEPT IT CLEAN 
HAPPY TO SELL IT CERTAINLY EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
CERTAINLY WELL LET'S HAVE A. 
ANY REQUESTS THAT SOUNDS BETTER THAN MINE 
DEBBIE HELLO 
WHY DID YOU COME ALONG AND BRING ALONG THIS 
WHAT SUPPOSEDLY IS A TOILET SET 
UM WELL I BELIEVE IT'S WEMYSS WARE 
AND WE'RE JUST REALLY INTERESTED IN HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH 
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT IT IS WEMYSS WARE 
WEMYSS BEING A SCOTTISH MANUFACTURERS 
WHERE'S IT COME FROM 
ORIGINALLY IT WAS FROM MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE 
IT WAS ON DISPLAY THERE FOR MANY YEARS 
WHEN SHE DIED IT WAS JUST TOO BIG TO FIT IN ANYBODY ELSE'S HOUSE 
IT'S BEEN IN STORAGE SINCE THEN 
I'M INTRIGUED YOUR MUM OBVIOUSLY TOOK IT FROM YOUR GRANDMA'S WHEN SHE DIED YEAH 
SHE PUT IT IN THE LOFT COS SHE COULDN'T FIT IT ELSEWHERE YES 
SOMETHING MUST HAVE CLICKED WITH YOUR MUM AND MAYBE YOU TO SAY 
HANG ON WE MIGHT KEEP THIS WEMYSS TOILET SET 
SHE KNEW IT WAS A NAME THAT SHE'D HEARD BEFORE 
SO IT MIGHT BE WORTH SOMETHING SO YEAH SHE KEPT IT 
SHE JUST COULDN'T HAVE IT ON DISPLAY 
I FIND THESE STORIES INTRIGUING 
IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE I DON'T PUT ANYTHING IN MY LOFT 
HAVE YOU GOT STUFF IN YOUR LOFT 
NOT AS MUCH AS MY MOTHER 
MY MOTHER HAS A LOFT FULL 
IT IS GREAT IT'S A LOVELY LOVELY SET 
YOU NORMALLY SEE WEMYSS WITH LOTS OF BIG FLOWERS ON 
YOU DON'T NORMALLY SEE A FULL SET LIKE THIS 
YOU ARE MISSING ONE ITEM WHICH IS THE COVER TO THE WATER BUCKET YES 
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT OR WAS THAT ALWAYS BROKEN 
I REMEMBER THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE I CAN'T REMEMBER THE BUCKET WHETHER IT WAS 
THE BUCKET IS VASTLY UNATTRACTIVE 
REALLY THE MOST ATTRACTIVE ITEMS ARE THE JUG AND BASIN HERE YES 
THE SPONGE DISH SPONGES IN THERE TO KEEP IT ALL DRY 
THIS IS THE SOAP DISH AND COVER WHAT'S NICE IS ON HERE 
WE'VE GOT THE WEMYSS STAMP AND THERE'S T. G. GOODE AND CO LONDON 
THAT'S THE RETAILER 
PROBABLY BOUGHT IN LONDON IN THE EARLY PART OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
LATE NINETEEN THIRTIES TWENTIETH CENTURY ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
I WOULD LIKE TO PUT THIS IN AT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED FOR THE SET 
RIGHT HOW DOES THAT GRAB YOU 
YES THAT'S LOVELY MORE THAN I EXPECTED I THINK 
WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING I DON'T KNOW 
TO ME IT'S JUST NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE 
SO IF WE GET YOU THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH IT 
WELL OBVIOUSLY I'LL GIVE IT TO MY MOTHER IT'S HERS 
WHAT SHE DECIDES TO DO WITH IT WILL BE 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU WAITED TODAY 
A GOOD FEW HOURS 
SURELY IT'S ONE HUNDRED AN HOUR ISN'T IT FOR THIS WAITING 
SO YOU CAN GET THE MONEY BACK WE'LL TRY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING IT ALONG 
I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU AT THE AUCTION LOVELY 
EVERYBODY'S HAVING A GREAT TIME AND IF YOU LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER WE'VE GOT PLENTY MORE PEOPLE TO SEE 
WE'LL TAKE OUR FIRST VISIT TO THE AUCTION ROOM 
WHILE I MAKE MY WAY OVER THERE HERE'S A RUNDOWN OF THE ITEMS WE'VE PICKED TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
WE'LL FIND OUT IN JUST A MOMENT WHETHER THE MISSING LID ON THE WEMYSS WASH SET 
WILL AFFECT ITS AUCTION PRICE AND WHETHER THE PARIAN WARE IS MORE THAN JUST A PRETTY FACE 
WITH NO RESERVE SURELY THE SPECTACLE CASE HAS TO SELL 
AND THE CONCERTINA IS PLAYING JUST ONE TUNE MONEY MONEY MONEY 
TODAY OUR SALE COMES FROM TRING MARKET AUCTION ROOMS 
THE MAN WITH THE GAVEL AND ALL THE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE IS AUCTIONEER STEPHEN HEARN 
HAVE OUR EXPERTS GOT THEIR VALUATIONS RIGHT LET'S FIND OUT LET'S ASK STEPHEN 
THIS NEXT ITEM IS PART OF A WEMYSS WASH SET THERE'S A LOT OF IT 
IT BELONGS TO DEBBIE AND THIS HAS BEEN IN HER MUM'S LOFT FOR THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS 
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY ON IT FOR THE AMOUNT YOU GET OF WEMYSS 
IT'S FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED 
WELL I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO WELL FOR DEBBIE ON THIS ONE 
I THINK THERE'S BEEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF INTEREST IN THE SET 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT MAY BE HAD A BEAKER WITH IT AND IT COULD EVEN HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF CHAMBER POTS 
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF WEMYSS ON THE SHOW BEFORE 
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE FLOWERS AND THE PIGS 
BUT I'VE NOT EVER SEEN ANY WITH A BLACK GROUNDING LIKE THAT 
YES WELL THIS BLACK GROUNDING WAS INTRODUCED BY SHAPLAND 
HE INTRODUCED OIL INTO THE COLOUR MIXTURE 
TO MAKE IT RATHER MORE ROBUST AND IT DIDN'T CHIP AS MUCH 
DID IT SELL AS WELL THOUGH 
IT DOES LOOK DOUR COMPARED TO THE BRIGHTER VESSELS 
A LOT OF IT WAS TO ORDER 
POSSIBLY WHY THOMAS GOODE RETAILED IT 
THAT NORMALLY COST ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT MORE 
DID IT YES TO HAVE THE OIL INTRODUCED INTO THE GLAZE YES 
SO THIS COULD BE RARER THAT'S RIGHT 
HAS THERE BEEN MUCH INTEREST THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST YES 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO GO BACK HOME TO SCOTLAND 
AND AT WHAT COST THREE TIMES ESTIMATE 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TOP END 
THAT MAY BE REAL TOP END 
I CAN SEE IT DOING TWELVE ANYWAY I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS SALE TO START 
IF THEY WERE ALL LIKE THAT ONE I'D SIT ALL DAY DOING THIS

THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY HAVE A GREAT HOLIDAY WE WILL 
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PARTS OF LONDON IS SPITALFIELDS AND I'M STANDING RIGHT IN IT 
IT'S WHERE THE ICONIC BUILDINGS OF THE FINANCIAL HUBS OF THE CITY 
RUB SHOULDERS WITH SOME OF THE FINEST ARCHITECTURE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
IF YOU LIKE IT'S WHERE THE PAST MEETS THE PRESENT 
BEHIND ITS RED BRICK WALLS OLD SPITALFIELDS HAS A HIDDEN GEM 
AN AMERICAN ARTIST CALLED DENNIS SEVERS HAD THIS LIFELONG AMBITION 
TO DISREGARD EVERYTHING MODERN AND LIVE IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
HE DID IT RIGHT HERE NUMBER EIGHTEEN FOLGATE STREET 
IF EVER THERE WAS AN ADDRESS WHERE THE PAST MEETS THE PRESENT WELL IT'S GOT TO BE THIS ONE HASN'T IT 
SO LET'S GO FROM THE PRESENT 
AND BACK INTO THE PAST 
AS SOON AS YOUR CROSS THIS THRESHOLD YOU GET THIS OVERWHELMING FEELING OF BEING TRANSPORTED BACK IN TIME 
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE PERIOD FURNITURE THE OIL PAINTINGS AND THE DECORATION 
IF YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK ON THE GATE LEG TABLE HERE 
YOU CAN SEE FOOD HALF EATEN GLASSES OF WINE STILL FULL AND CANDLES STILL BURNING 
IT'S AS IF SOMEBODY HAS JUST NIPPED OUT FOR A SECOND AND WE'RE EXPECTING THEM BACK ANY MOMENT 
I'M WITH DAVID MILNE WHO'S THE CURATOR OF THE HOUSE 
AND WAS A GOOD FRIEND OF DENNIS SEVERS 
WHO SADLY DIED A YOUNG MAN JUST A FEW YEARS AGO 
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WAS HE AN ECCENTRIC ARTIST OR WAS HE A PASSIONATE HISTORIAN 
HE WAS BOTH I THINK MORE ECCENTRIC ARTIST THAN PASSIONATE HISTORIAN 
HE WASN'T INTERESTED IN HISTORICAL ACCURACY 
HE WAS MORE INTERESTED IN RECREATING A TASTE OR AN IMAGE OF THE PAST 
WHERE WAS THE INSPIRATION FROM 
SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA HE HAD THESE DREAMS OF BEING ENGLISH AND COMING TO ENGLAND 
HE DIDN'T HAVE DREAMS OF BEING ENGLISH BUT HE HAD THIS LOVE OR THIS IDEA OF WHAT ENGLAND WAS LIKE 
THAT BIZARRE IDEA THAT PEOPLE HAVE OF WHAT OLD ENGLAND WAS LIKE 
THROUGH WATCHING T. V. HOLLYWOOD MOVIES HOLLYWOOD MOVIES THAT IDEA OF THE PAST 
COSTUME PERIOD DRAMAS BIG STATELY HOMES CLASSICAL LONDON 
WHEN HE COULDN'T FIND IT HE CREATED IT WITHIN THE WALLS OF HIS OWN HOME 
THIS BASICALLY WAS HIS CANVAS 
IT'S LIKE THEATRE REALLY HE'S JUST APPLYING LAYER UPON LAYER 
A COMBINATION OF CLOTHES SMELLS AND PROPS MAKES YOU FEEL THAT A FAMILY ARE JUST A FEW PACES AWAY 
AND THE FEELING OF BEING LIVED IN IS EXACTLY WHAT DENNIS SEVERS WANTED TO ACHIEVE 
HE LIVED HERE ON HIS OWN AND HE REMOVED ALL TRACES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
HE THEN INVENTED A FAMILY OF FRENCH PROTESTANT REFUGEES AND HE CALLED THEM THE JARVIS' 
HE MADE THIS TIME CAPSULE THEIR HOME 
I LIVE WITH A FICTITIOUS FAMILY CALLED THE JARVIS' 
THERE ARE FOUR GENERATIONS OF THEM 
THEY'RE NOT SPECTACULAR THEY'RE MIDDLE CLASS 
SILK WEAVERS AND HUGUENOTS 
AND THEY CONFORM COMPLETELY TO THE SPIRIT OF THEIR AGE 
THEY GIVE THE HOUSE SUBSTANCE SO THAT WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE HOUSE YOU ARE IN THEIR HOME 
WHEN YOU WALK INTO A ROOM AND YOU SEE A TABLE WITH HALF EATEN FOOD 
AND WINE GLASSES AND THE MASTER'S WIG HANGING ON THE CHAIR 
SUDDENLY THOSE PEOPLE ARE HERE AND IT BECOMES REAL 
IT BRINGS THEM ALIVE YEAH OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE 
A STATIC MUSEUM AGAIN WITH OBJECTS 
WHAT DO THE VISITORS THINK WHEN THEY COME HERE 
THEIR REACTION IS ALWAYS SO DIFFERENT BECAUSE PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE 
THEY'VE NEVER HAD AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THIS 
THEN YOU GET THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO USED TO THE MUSEUM VISITS 
THAT THEY CAN'T QUITE GRASP IT BECAUSE THERE'S NO INFORMATION THERE'S NOTHING TO READ 
THEN YOU GET THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THIS IMMENSE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE AND THEY LEAVE THE HOUSE IN TEARS 
SOMEHOW THIS HOUSE TOUCHES 
IT TOUCHES YOUR SOUL YES IT REALLY DOES TOUCH YOUR SOUL 
EVERYTHING IS TACTILE 
YOU CAN TOUCH THINGS IN HERE YOU CAN SIT DOWN 
UNLIKE A MUSEUM YOU CAN SIT ON THE FURNITURE 
FOR ME THIS HOUSE IS DEFINITELY A THEATRE OF DREAMS 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING IT'S WORTH A VISIT 
I'M GOING TO REPHRASE THAT 
IT'S WELL WORTH SEVERAL VISITS BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD LESSON IN HOW TO STYLE AND USE ANTIQUES 
RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO FROM THE PAST STRAIGHT BACK TO THE PRESENT 
HELLO CHRIS I KNOW YOU'RE A GREAT FAN OF FLOG IT AREN'T YOU 
I AM YES NEVER MISS AN EPISODE 
NO WE ALWAYS WATCH IT 
I REALLY LIKE THIS NAIVE PICTURE BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY TO IT CAN YOU FILL US IN ON THAT STORY 
THE STORY THAT I KNOW ABOUT IS THAT IT'S WATFORD'S ONLY DERBY WINNER 
AND I THINK IT WAS IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTIES AND IT WAS BRED IN WATFORD AT A LOCAL FARM 
ALSO MY EX FIANCE'S FATHER WORKED AT BENSKINS BREWERY 
WHICH WAS WATFORD'S LOCAL BREWERY AND IT CAME I BELIEVE FROM ONE OF THE LOCAL PUBS OH RIGHT 
YOU INHERITED THIS I BELIEVE 
I INHERITED IT YES WHEN WAS THAT 
ABOUT TEN WEEKS AGO MY FIANCE DIED VERY SUDDENLY TEN WEEKS AGO I'M SORRY THANK YOU 
IT'S A GREAT SUBJECT ISN'T IT 
IT IS VERY GOOD LOCAL INTEREST 
VERY GOOD LOCAL INTEREST IT WOULD BE NICE TO PROVE THAT 
IF WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE PAINTING WE'VE GOT THE OWNER STANDING THERE IN HIS BEST SUNDAY OUTFIT YES 
YOU'VE GOT THE TRAINER STANDING NEXT TO HIM AND THE JOCKEY ON HORSEBACK 
THEN THE LOCAL TRAINING FIELD IN THE BACKGROUND 
FROM THE COSTUMES WE'RE CERTAINLY LOOKING AT THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS THAT'S RIGHT 
PROBABLY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY AROUND ABOUT THAT ERA I WOULD SAY FROM THE COSTUMES 
I HAVE NOTICED THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF RESTORATION DID YOU KNOW THAT I DID KNOW THAT 
WHICH IS ACROSS THE TRAINER'S HEAD THERE AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF WEAR GENERALLY SPEAKING 
HAVING SAID THAT IT'S IN QUITE GOOD CONDITION 
PEOPLE WOULD NOT ONLY LIKE THE LOCAL HISTORY BUT THEY LIKE THE NAIVE PICTURE YEAH 
YOU KNOW WITH HORSES AND THINGS TO DO WITH SPORTING 
A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE FOLLOW THAT 
HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF THE VALUE 
I HAVEN'T AT ALL NO IDEA 
I THINK BEARING IN MIND THE SLIGHT DAMAGE AND THE FACT WE HAVEN'T GOT A FULL PROVENANCE WITH IT 
I'D LIKE TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAUTIOUS TO GIVE IT A SPORTING CHANCE 
I WOULD SUGGEST AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
YES SMASHING DO YOU LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT 
YES I DO AND YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE A PUNT ON IT WITH US I WILL WONDERFUL 
RICHARD YOU HAVE BROUGHT IN SOMETHING RATHER SPECIAL HAVEN'T YOU 
YES I FOUND IT AT A CAR BOOT SALE LAST SUMMER 
AND I KNEW IT WAS SOMETHING NICE BUT I DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS 
WELL I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS 
IT IS PIECE OF ART NOUVEAU PEWTER MADE BY THE FACTORY KAYSERZINN 
KAYSERZINN IS A GERMAN MANUFACTURERS 
THEY MADE PEWTER IN THE ART NOUVEAU STYLE IN THE LATE NINETEENTH EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY 
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR IT 
THE LADY WANTED EIGHT BUT I NEGOTIATED DOWN TO A FIVER 
WHY IT WAS THAT WHY WAS THE NEGOTIATION IN THERE 
BECAUSE IT IS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE 
IF YOU ARE A CAR BOOTER YOU ALWAYS WANT TO GET THE BEST DEAL 
WHAT TIME DID YOU TURN UP TO THE BOOT SALE 
THIS TIME I WAS THERE EARLY AND I PAID AN EXTRA POUND TO GET IN AS AN EARLY BUYER THEY CALL IT REALLY 
YES SO YOU GET THE ADVANTAGE ON EVERYBODY ELSE 
SO FIVE FOR YOUR KEYSERZINN FISH DISH IN PEWTER 
WE CAN CALL IT ART NOUVEAU OR THE GERMAN WORD WHICH IS JUNGENSTIL THE YOUNG STYLE 
AND IT HAS GOT ALL THE TYPICAL ATTRIBUTES OF ANY ART NOUVEAU OR JUNGENSTIL STYLE PIECE 
YOU HAVE THE SINUOUS FLOWING LINES HERE WHICH THE FISH HAVE MADE THROUGH SWIMMING IN IT 
THE INTERESTING THING IS THE DECORATION WHICH IS ASYMMETRICAL 
TYPICAL OF THE ART NOUVEAU PERIOD DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S FROM NO 
JAPANESE PLATES OR JAPANESE DESIGN AND CHINESE IS ASYMMETRICAL 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DESIGNS THEY DON'T ALWAYS FOLD 
HERE IN THE WEST WE LOVE THINGS WHICH MATCH WE ARE OBSESSED BY IT 
LOOK AT OUR MANTELPIECES MANTELPIECE IS FIRE MIRROR VASES MATCH 
FOLD THEM ON EACH OTHER 
ESPECIALLY IN JAPANESE DESIGNED PLATES IF YOU LOOK AT THEM THE DESIGN IS NOT LIKE THAT 
IT IS ASYMMETRICAL 
HERE THEY HAVE REALLY TURNED IT ON ITS HEAD 
THE DECORATION HERE BULRUSHES AND THEN SOME MORE HERE 
IT IS A NICE THING A LOVELY THING 
IT'S GOT ALL THOSE ATTRIBUTES THE BULRUSHES 
WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF YOU HAD A NAKED LADY ON THERE WHICH IS A REAL FEMME FATALE 
A MOTIF OF THE ART NOUVEAU PERIOD 
BUT THEY WERE INTERESTED IN NATURE AND THIS SHOWS THIS IS A FISH DISH IT HAS FISH ON IT 
NOW FIVE POUNDS NOT BAD 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS WORTH WELL I GUESS TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I THINK A BIT MORE I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT 
FORTY TO SIXTY SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT IS A POPULAR THING ART NOUVEAU 
IT'S GOT A FEW NICKS BITS OF DAMAGE 
I WONDERED ABOUT THAT 
PEWTER DOES DAMAGE IT IS A SOFT METAL IF WE WERE TO GET YOU THIRTY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THAT 
PUT IT BACK INTO THE BOOT SALE UM NO I WILL PROBABLY SPEND IT ON WINE WOMEN AND SQUANDER THE REST 
BRILLIANT 
I THINK THAT IS THE BEST ANSWER I'VE HAD 
IT'S A ONE ARMED RABBIT 
AND HE LOOKS LIKE HE NEVER HAD AN ARM 
NO I DON'T THINK HE DID SO WHAT'S IT WORTH THEN 
AN ARM AND A LEG 
HELLO CHRISTINE WHAT A WONDERFUL BOX YOU'VE BROUGHT IN TO SHOW US TODAY 
WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM 
IT WAS MY BROTHER IN LAW'S GRANDMOTHER'S 
THEY BROUGHT IT BACK FROM HONG KONG WHEN THEY CAME BACK FROM THE DOCKYARDS IN NINETEEN TWENTY 
AND IT WAS SOMETHING THEY BROUGHT ALONG WITH THEM YES AND HOW DID YOU GET IT 
WHEN THE HOUSE WAS SPLIT UP AT THE END WHEN 
WHAT WE KNEW AS GRANNY KEY DIED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY 
THEN I HAD IT BECAUSE THE LION WAS BROKEN OFF THE TOP 
AND NOBODY ELSE WANTED IT AND I COULDN'T LET IT GO TO THE SCRAP YARD 
WELL IT'S A GOOD POINT BEFORE WE LOOK AT THE BOX BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY 
THE LION DOG OR THE TEMPLE DOG WHICH WOULD HAVE SAT VERY PROUDLY ON THERE 
HAS GOT THE TWO FRONT LEGS BROKEN SO IT IS A BIT OF A SHAME THAT 
I SUPPOSE IT COULD BE RESTORED BUT IT LOOKS MAGNIFICENT ON THE TOP THERE 
OF COURSE THESE DAYS PEOPLE LIKE A VERY SIMPLE OBJECTS FLAT LINES NOT CARVED 
YOU CAN'T CALL THIS A SIMPLE ITEM NO 
HERE WE'VE GOT A BOX WHICH IS FULL OF CHINESE EMBLEMS 
FLYING BATS SQUIRRELS IN TREES DRAGONS AND BIRDS CARVED ON THERE 
AND THEN THESE WONDERFUL FEET OF DRAGON'S HEADS 
AND THE WHOLE THING IS VERY WELL DONE IN AN ORIENTAL HARDWOOD 
SO WHERE DOES IT LIVE IN YOUR HOME 
IN OUR BEDROOM USUALLY HAS THE HANKIES IN IT 
OF COURSE YOU CAN IF WE OPEN IT UP WE'VE GOT A SIMPLE INTERIOR JUST ONE LITTLE TRAY NOTHING UNDERNEATH 
SO YOU CAN KEEP ANYTHING YOU WANT IN IT REALLY 
I BELIEVE IT WAS A COMPENDIUM BOX WHEN IT WAS FIRST BROUGHT BACK 
COMPENDIUM BOX IS A LOVELY WORD I LOVE THAT WORD MYSELF 
BUT THOSE TEND TO BE FITTED BOXES FOR GAMES 
YOU HAVE YOUR DICE DRAUGHTS AND CHESS 
THIS YOU CAN REALLY USE FOR ANYTHING 
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE VALUE OF IT 
NO I HAVE NO IDEA WHATSOEVER 
I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE OF HUGE VALUE 
IF WE PUT IT IN THE SALE WE HAVE GOT TO BE SENSIBLE ABOUT IT 
I AM GOING TO COME OUT WITH A CLICHE I AM AFRAID 
I AM GOING TO SUGGEST EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
THAT'S QUITE GOOD WOULD YOU BE HAPPY WITH THAT YES
