I FEEL LONELY 
I FEEL SO GOOD 
IT'S A MARVELLOUS NIGHT FOR A MOONDANCE 
WITH THE STARS UP ABOVE IN YOUR EYES 
A FANTABULOUS NIGHT TO MAKE ROMANCE 'NEATH THE COVER OF OCTOBER SKIES 
AND ALL THE LEAVES ON THE TREES ARE FALLING 
TO THE SOUND OF THE BREEZES THAT BLOW 
AND I'M TRYING TO PLEASE TO THE CALLING OF YOUR HEART STRINGS 
THAT PLAY SOFT AND LOW 
ALL THE NIGHT'S MAGIC SEEMS TO WHISPER AND HUSH 
ALL THE SOFT MOONLIGHT SEEMS TO SHINE IN YOUR BLUSH 
CAN I JUST HAVE ONE MORE MOONDANCE WITH YOU MY LOVE 
CAN I JUST MAKE SOME MORE ROMANCE WITH YOU MY LOVE 
WELL I WANNA MAKE LOVE TO YOU TONIGHT 
I CAN'T WAIT TILL THE MORNING HAS COME 
AND I KNOW NOW THAT THE TIME IS JUST RIGHT 
AND STRAIGHT INTO MY ARMS YOU WILL RUN 
AND WHEN YOU COME MY HEART WILL BE WAITING 
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NEVER ALONE 
THERE AND THEN ALL MY DREAMS WILL COME TRUE DEAR 
THERE AND THEN I WILL MAKE YOU MY OWN 
AND EVERY TIME I TOUCH YOU 
YOU JUST TREMBLE INSIDE 
AND I KNOW HOW MUCH I WANT YOU THAT I CAN'T HIDE 
CAN I JUST HAVE ONE MORE MOONDANCE WITH YOU MY LOVE 
CAN I JUST MAKE SOME MORE ROMANCE WITH YOU MY LOVE 
IT'S A MARVELLOUS NIGHT FOR A MOONDANCE 
WITH THE STARS UP ABOVE IN YOUR EYES 
A FANTABULOUS NIGHT TO MAKE ROMANCE 'NEATH THE COVER OF OCTOBER SKIES 
ALL THE LEAVES ON THE TREES ARE FALLING 
TO THE SOUND OF THE BREEZES THAT BLOW 
I'M TRYING TO PLEASE TO THE CALLING OF YOUR HEART STRINGS 
THAT PLAY THAT PLAY THAT PLAY SOFT AND LOW 
ALL THE NIGHT'S MAGIC SEEMS TO WHISPER AND HUSH 
ALL THE SOFT MOONLIGHT SEEMS TO SHINE IN YOUR BLUSH 
CAN I JUST HAVE ONE MORE MOONDANCE WITH YOU MY LOVE 
CAN I JUST MAKE SOME MORE ROMANCE WITH YOU MY LOVE 
IN THE MOONLIGHT 
ON A MAGIC NIGHT 
IN THE MOONLIGHT 
CAN'T I JUST HAVE ONE MORE DANCE 
WITH YOU MY LOVE 
I WALKED IN MY GREATCOAT 
DOWN THROUGH THE DAYS OF THE LEAVES 
NO BEFORE AND AFTER YES AFTER BEFORE 
WE WERE SHINING OUR LIGHT INTO THE DAYS OF BLOOMING WONDER 
IN THE ETERNAL PRESENCE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE FLAME 
DIDN'T I COME TO BRING YOU A SENSE OF WONDER 
DIDN'T I COME TO LIFT YOUR FIERY VISION BRIGHT 
DIDN'T I COME TO BRING YOU A SENSE OF WONDER IN THE FLAME 
ON AND ON AND ON AND ON 
WE KEPT ON SINGING OUR SONG 
OVER NEWTONARDS AND COMBER GRANSHA AND THE BALLYSTOCKART ROAD 
WITH SPIKE AND BOFFYFLOW 
I SAID I COULD DESCRIBE THE LEAVES FOR SAMUEL AND FELICITY 
RICH RED BROWNY HALF BURNT ORANGE AND GREEN 
DIDN'T I COME TO BRING YOU A SENSE OF WONDER 
DIDN'T I COME TO LIFT YOUR FIERY VISION BRIGHT 
DIDN'T I COME TO BRING YOU A SENSE OF WONDER IN THE FLAME 
IT'S EASY TO DESCRIBE THE LEAVES IN THE AUTUMN 
AND IT'S OH SO EASY IN THE SPRING 
BUT DOWN THROUGH JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING 
ON AND ON AND ON THROUGH THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT 
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS UP THE COLLAR AND THE EARS ARE FROSTBITTEN TOO 
I SAID I COULD DESCRIBE THE LEAVES FOR SAMUEL 
AND WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU AND ME 
YOU MIGHT CALL MY LOVE SOPHIA 
BUT I CALL MY LOVE PHILOSOPHY 
DIDN'T I COME TO BRING YOU A SENSE OF WONDER 
DIDN'T I COME TO LIFT YOUR FIERY VISION 
DIDN'T I COME TO BRING YOU A SENSE OF WONDER IN THE FLAME 
DIDN'T I COME TO BRING YOU A SENSE OF WONDER 
DIDN'T I COME TO LIFT YOUR FIERY VISION 
DIDN'T I COME TO BRING YOU A SENSE OF WONDER IN THE FLAME 
SENSE OF WONDER 
DOWN THROUGH THE DAYS OF THE LEAVES 
WEE ALFIE AT THE CASTLE PICTURE HOUSE ON THE CASTLEREAGH ROAD 
WHISTLING ON THE CORNER NEXT DOOR 
WHERE HE KEPT JOHNNY MACBROWN'S HORSE 
O. SOLO MIO BY MCGIMSEY 
AND THE MAN WHO PLAYED THE SAW OUTSIDE THE CITY HALL 
PASTIE SUPPERS DOWN AT DAVEY'S CHIPPER 
WAGON WHEELS GRAVY RINGS 
SNOWBALLS 
SENSE OF WONDER 
SENSE OF WONDER 
DOWN THROUGH THE DAYS OF THE LEAVES 
SENSE OF WONDER 
DOWN THROUGH THE DAYS OF THE LEAVES 
AND WE'LL WALK DOWN THE AVENUE AGAIN 
AND WE'LL SING ALL THE SONGS FROM WAY BACK WHEN 
AND WE'LL WALK DOWN THE AVENUE AGAIN 
WHEN THE HEALING HAS BEGUN 
AND WE'LL WALK DOWN THE AVENUE AND SMILE 
AND WE'LL WALK DOWN THE AVENUE IN STYLE 
AND WE'LL SAY BABY AIN'T IT ALL WORTHWHILE 
WHEN THE HEALING HAS BEGUN 
I WAS AN APPRENTICE ENGINEER 
I WANTED TO BE A MUSICIAN 
I WAS ALREADY PLAYING GUITAR SO I WENT DOWN TO THE MUSICIANS UNION AND JOINED 
I NEVER FELT LIKE I BELONG ON THE STAGE 
I DON'T FEEL I BELONG ON THE STAGE 
YOU WRITE SONGS THAT BECOMES A JOB 
AFTER A WHILE THAT'S WHAT YOU DO 
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANOTHER JOB YOU KEEP DOING THAT IT'S SIMPLE 
IT STARTED AS A JOB AND IT'S STILL A JOB 
YOU CAN WRITE SONGS ABOUT ANYTHING BUT WHAT COMES HARDER 
IS THE PROJECTION OF IT AND THE FACT YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICISED AND ANALYSED 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND ALL THIS THAT MAKES IT A CHORE 
YOU KNOW BEFORE YOU START IT'S GOING INTO THE MARKET PLACE 
AND IT'S GOING TO BE CUT UP AND SPAT OUT 
THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SPONTANEOUS 
IF I KNEW WHAT I WAS SAYING 
THEN I'D SAY THIS IS ABOUT THIS 
THAT'S NOT WHAT WRITING IS TO ME 
IT'S COMING FORM THE UNCONSCIOUS THE COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS OR SOMETHING 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS EITHER 
ME I DON'T HAVE TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS 
IT'S JUST DOING IT 
ON DOWN BY AVALON AVALON OF THE HEART 
ON DOWN BY AVALON 
GONNA MAKE A BRAND NEW START 
OH THE HOLY GRAIL 
BABY BEHIND THE SUN 
OH THE HOLY GRAIL 
DOWN BY AVALON 
WELL I CAME UPON THE ENCHANTED VALE 
DOWN BY THE VIADUCTS OF MY DREAMS 
DOWN BY CAMELOT 
HANGS THE TALE IN THE ANCIENT VALE 
IN THE UPPER ROOM 
WHERE THE CUP DOES STAND 
IN THE UPPER ROOM DOWN BY AVALON 
WELL I CAME UPON THE ENCHANTED VALE 
DOWN BY THE VIADUCTS OF MY DREAMS 
DOWN BY CAMELOT 
HANGS THE TALE IN THE ANCIENT VALE 
OH THE AVALON SUNSET 
AVALON OF THE HEART 
ME AND MY LADY 
GOING DOWN BY AVALON 
GOING DOWN BY AVALON 
BABY BEHIND THE SUN 
GOING DOWN BY AVALON 
WELL THE JOURNEY'S JUST BEGUN 
FOGHORNS BLOWING IN THE NIGHT 
SALT SEA AIR IN THE MORNING BREEZE 
MOVING ALL ALONG THE COASTLINE 
THIS MUST BE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
THIS MUST BE WHAT PARADISE FEELS LIKE 
THIS MUST BE WHAT PARADISE FEELS LIKE BABY 
SO QUIET IN HERE SO PEACEFUL IN HERE 
SO QUIET IN HERE PEACEFUL IN HERE 
THE WARM LOOK OF RADIANCE ON YOUR FACE 
AND YOUR HEART BEATING CLOSE TO MINE 
AND IN THE CANDLE GLOW 
THIS MUST BE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
THIS MUST BE WHAT PARADISE FEELS LIKE 
THIS MUST BE WHAT PARADISE FEELS LIKE BABY 
SO QUIET IN HERE PEACEFUL IN HERE 
SO QUIET IN HERE PEACEFUL IN HERE 
ALL THE STRUGGLING IN THE WORLD 
WON'T MAKE ANY DREAMS COME TRUE 
STEP BACK PUT IT ALL AWAY FOR A MINUTE 
THIS MUST BE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
THIS MUST BE WHAT PARADISE FEELS LIKE 
THIS MUST BE WHAT PARADISE FEELS LIKE BABY 
IT'S SO QUIET IN HERE SO PEACEFUL IN HERE 
IT'S SO QUIET IN HERE PEACEFUL IN HERE 
BIG SHIPS SAILING IN THE NIGHT 
AND WE'RE FLOATING ACROSS THE WAVES 
SAILING FOR SOME OTHER SHORE 
WHERE WE CAN DREAM ON DREAM ON 
DREAM ON 
THIS MUST BE WHAT PARADISE IS LIKE 
THIS MUST BE WHAT PARADISE IS LIKE BABY IT'S JUST 
SO QUIET IN HERE 
SO PEACEFUL IN HERE 
SO QUIET IN HERE 
PEACEFUL IN HERE 
SO QUIET IN HERE 
PEACEFUL IN HERE 
CAN YOU FEEL THE SILENCE 
CAN YOU FEEL THE SILENCE 
SO QUIET IN HERE 
YOU CAME TO SEE ME WHEN THE MOON WAS NEW 
SAW YOU STANDING IN THE POURING RAIN 
LEFT MY MESSAGE ON THE WINDOWSILL 
BACK ON THE STREET AGAIN 
BACK ON MY FEET AGAIN 
BACK ON THE TOP AGAIN

LEARNED MY LESSON AND I'M LEARNING STILL 
LEARNED IT ALL IN VAIN 
BACK ON THE STREET AGAIN 
BACK ON THE TOP AGAIN 
ALWAYS STRIVING 
ALWAYS CLIMBING WAY BEYOND MY WILL 
SAME OLD SENSATION 
ISOLATION AT THE TOP OF THE BILL 
ALWAYS SEEMING 
LIKE I'M MOVING BUT I'M REALLY GOING SLOW 
YOU'LL FIND OUT WHEN YOU REACH THE TOP 
THAT THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO 
HOW YOU GET DOWN WILL BE ANYBODY'S GUESS 
WITH ALL THE SO CALLED TRAPPINGS OF SUCCESS 
LEFT ALL THE DEADBEATS ON THE TOP OF THE HILL 
TOO BUSY RAISING CAIN 
BACK ON THE STREET AGAIN 
BACK ON THE TOP AGAIN

ALWAYS CLIMBING WAY BEYOND MY WILL 
SAME OLD SENSATION 
ISOLATION AT THE TOP OF THE BILL 
ALWAYS SEEMING LIKE I'M MOVING

YOU'LL FIND OUT WHEN YOU GET TO THE TOP 
THAT THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO 
HOW YOU GET DOWN WILL BE ANYBODY'S GUESS 
WITH ALL THE SO CALLED TRAPPINGS OF SUCCESS 
LEFT ALL THE DEADBEATS ON THE TOP OF THE HILL 
TOO BUSY RAISING CAIN 
BACK ON THE STREET AGAIN 
BACK ON THE TOP AGAIN 
BACK ON THE STREET AGAIN 
BACK ON MY FEET AGAIN 
BACK ON THE TOP AGAIN 
I SAW YOU STANDING WITH THE WIND 
AND THE RAIN 
IN YOUR FACE 
AND YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT THE WISDOM 
OF THE LEAVES 
AND THEIR GRACE 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
AND AT NIGHT THE MOON IS SHINING ON 
A CLEAR 
CLOUDLESS SKY 
AND WHEN THE EVENING SHADOWS FALL 
I'LL BE THERE 
BY YOUR SIDE 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
TO THE PLACE BESIDE THE GARDEN AND THE WALL 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
TO THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWILIGHT AND THE DAWN 
OH THE LAST TIME I SAW PARIS 
IN THE STREETS 
WITH A FRIEND 
AND AS I WALKED ALONG THE BOULEVARD

ONCE AGAIN 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
WHE E. EN WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
TO THE PLACE BESIDE THE GARDEN AND THE WALL

AND AS I'M LOOKING AT THE COLOURS 
OF THE LEAVES 
IN YOUR HAND 
AS WE'RE LISTENING TO CHET BAKER 
ON THE BEACH 
IN JUAN LES PINS 
OH THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
YEAH SEPTEMBER IN THE RAIN WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
YEAH THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
YEAH SEPTEMBER IN THE RAIN 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN IN SEPTEMBER 
IN THE RAIN WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
IN SEPTEMBER IN THE RAIN 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPING AWAY 
BUT YOU'RE ONLY KING FOR A DAY 
DOESN'T MATTER TO WHICH GOD YOU PRAY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPING AWAY 
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ROUTE YOU TAKE 
SOONER OR LATER YOUR HEART'S GONNA BREAK 
NO RHYME OR REASON NO MASTER PLAN 
NO NIRVANA NO PROMISED LAND 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPING AWAY 
THOUGH YOU'RE ONLY KING FOR A DAY 
DOESN'T MATTER TO WHICH GOD YOU PRAY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPING AWAY 
QUE SERA SERA WHATEVER WILL BE 
KEEP ON SEARCHING FOR IMMORTALITY 
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL BUT SHE'S GOTTA DIE SOME DAY 
EVERYTHING IN LIFE JUST PASSES AWAY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPING AWAY 
BUT SHE'S ONLY QUEEN FOR A DAY 
DOESN'T MATTER TO WHICH GOD YOU PRAY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPING AWAY ALL RIGHT 
WELL THIS WORLD IS CRUEL WITH ITS TWISTS AND ITS TURNS 
WELL THE FIRE'S STILL IN ME AND THE PASSION STILL BURNS 
I LOVE A MEDLEY TILL THE DAY I DIE 
UNTIL HELL FREEZES OVER AND THE RIVERS RUN DRY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPING AWAY 
BUT SHE'S ONLY QUEEN FOR A DAY 
DOESN'T MATTER TO WHICH GOD YOU PRAY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPING AWAY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPING AWAY 
THOUGH SHE'S ONLY QUEEN FOR A DAY 
DOESN'T MATTER TO WHICH GOD YOU PRAY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPING AWAY
