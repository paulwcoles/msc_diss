ANOTHER FRAME WHERE RONNIE GETS THE 
FIRST GOOD CHANCE AND THE PRESSURE 
IS BACK ON ALI HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL 
GOOD AFTERNOON FOR THE LAST SEVENTEEN DAYS 
WE HAVE BEEN LIVING IN A WORLD 
WITHIN A WORLD HERE INSIDE 
SHEFFIELD'S CRUCIBLE THEATRE THIS 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP HAS PROVED TO BE 
AS ALL CONSUMING AND DEMANDING AS 
EVER FOR THE THIRTY TWO MEN WHO FIRST 
STARTED OUT YEAR AND ESPECIALLY 
FOR OUR FINALISTS RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN AND ALI CARTER THIS IS 
THE PRIZE THIS HAS BEEN THEIR 
JOURNEY RONNIE'S ATTEMPT TO WIN A 
THIRD WORLD TITLE BEGAN SOLIDLY IT 
ROARED INTO LIFE IN ROUND TWO WITH 
A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN TO SEE OFF MARK WILLIAMS 
LIANG WENBO POST IN QUESTIONS BUT 
O'SULLIVAN HAD ALL THE ANSWERS AND 
HE BEAT STEPHEN HENDRY WITH A DAY 
TO SPARE ALI CARTER SURVIVED 
AROUND ONE NAIL BITER HE LOOKED 
FULLY IN CONTROL AGAINST SHAUN 
MURPHY HIS CAMPAIGN TOOK OFF 
AGAINST PETER EBDON HE SCORED HIS 
FIRST EVER MAXIMUM BREAK HE BEAT 
JOE PERRY IN THEIR TENTS AND 
TRAINING MATCH HOW MUCH GAS WOULD 
HAVE LEFT FOR THE FINAL IN A 
TENSE AND DRAINING MATCH 
AT SIX TO TWO DOWN ALI CARTER FACED THE 
MOST SIGNIFICANT SESSION OF A 
SNOOKER CAREER WHEN THEY RESUMED 
YESTERDAY EVENING 
BUT RONNIE TOOK A FIVE FRAME LEAD AND 
NERVY AND SCRAPPY TENTH FRAME THE 
LONGEST OF THE MATCH WAS FINALLY 
SETTLED BY THIS CLEVER SHOT FROM 
CARTER 
BUT POOR CUEING COST CARTER DEER IN 
THE ELEVENTH FRAME O'SULLIVAN STEPPED 
IN WITH EIGHTY SIX 
HOWEVER ALI PICKED HIMSELF OFF TO 
TAKE THE TWELFTH WITH A BREAK OF SEVENTY SIX 
PICKED HIMSELF OFF EIGHT TO FOUR AT THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL THE THIRTEENTH SEEMED 
TO BE GOING RONNIE'S WAIT UNTIL A 
TERRIBLE KICK COST HIM AL POSITION 
ON THE BLACK CARTER TOOK HIS 
CHANCE TO NARROW THE GAP TO THREE 
FRAMES 
IF RONNIE WAS CONCERNED IT DID NOT 
SHOW A TYPICAL QUICK FIRE FIFTY SEVEN WAS 
HIS RESPONSE AND HE WAS NINE TO FIVE AHEAD 
THE FIFTEENTH WAS A FRAME OF MISSED POTS 
BOTH PLAYERS SQUANDERED FRAME 
WINNING CHANCES BUT IT WAS RONNIE 
WHO POUNCED FIRST AND THAT WAS 
COMPOUNDED IN THE LAST FRAME OF THE 
SESSION HIS FIRST CENTURY OF THE 
FINAL HIS FIFTIETH OF SEASON 
GIVING HIM AN IMPOSING ELEVEN TO FIVE LEAD 
OVERNIGHT HERE IN THE MEDIA ROOM 
ALWAYS A HOTBED OF FEVERISH 
ACTIVITY LET US SEE WHAT THE 
JOURNALISTS AND BROADCASTERS THINK 
DARREN BLISS WHAT DO YOU DARREN 
LEWIS HAD YOU SEE IT 
WE ARE EXPECTING RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
TO CONTINUE IN THE SAME VEIN IT IS 
ALL ABOUT THE START IF HE GETS OFF 
TO A BAD START IT COULD BE QUITE 
INTRIGUING IF HE DOES WIN THE 
FIRST COUPLE OF FRAMES I THINK IT 
COULD BE ONE WAY TRAFFIC 
SOMETIMES THERE IS A TWIST WHEN YOU 
GET TO THE FINAL KEY MARK INDEED 
THERE IS 
WITH RONNIE IT IS ABOUT THE MOOD HE 
IS IN IF HE STARTS OFF WELL IT 
WILL BE FASCINATING TO WATCH 
HIMSELF STEAMROLLER ALL WHITE TO 
THE LINE BUT IF CARTER CAN PUT HIM 
IN A BIT OF TROUBLE THEN MAYBE A 
COUPLE OF TWISTS 
THAT HAVE APT WORD WITH FOR AT STUD 
FROM FIVE LIVE ALI HAS TO WIN THIS 
FIRST SESSION CUE MARK FIVE TO THREE IS THE 
ABSOLUTE MINIMUM 
SIX TO TWO IDEALLY THE PROBLEM FOR CARTER 
IS HE MAY ALREADY HAVE MISSED HIS 
CHANCE YESTERDAY HE PROBABLY 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY NINE TO SEVEN BEHIND 
O'SULLIVAN WAS A BIT FLAT HE HAS 
NOT PLAYED HIS BEST BY ANY MEANS I 
EXPECTED TO PLAYED BETTER TODAY IT 
IS A HERCULEAN TASK FOR CARTER HE 
HAS TO WIN THE SESSION WITHOUT ANY 
SHADOW OF THE DOUBT HE WOULD DO 
WELL TO GET INTO DOUBLE FIGURES WE 
WERE NOT WITH WE WILL NOT BE HERE 
UNTIL HAVE PASSED WHEN THE MORNING 
IF ALL SUDDEN WINS SEVEN OF THE 
EIGHT FRAMES THIS AFTERNOON IT IS 
GOING TO BE OVER IN THE DAY 
O'SULLIVAN I DO NOT THINK THAT 
WHAT HAPPENED L. THINK ALI CARTER 
WILL TAKE IT INTO A FOURTH SESSION 
AFTER DOUBT IF HE CAN WIN NOBODY 
HAS COME BACK FROM ELEVEN TO FIVE DOWN IN A 
WORLD FINAL BEFORE RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HAS PLAYED EXCEPTIONALLY 
WELL IN THIS EVENT HE HAS BEEN 
VERY SMOOTH IN THE FINAL 
IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THIS FINAL 
COULD HAVE BEEN CLOSE THEIR ALI 
CARTER HAD NOT LOST A LITTLE 
DISCIPLINE LAST NIGHT HE MISSED A 
YELLOW THEN HE HAS THE LAST RED 
HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF IN THIS 
POSITION AND HE HAS TAKEN ON WHAT 
CAN ONLY BE DECIDE BE DESCRIBED 
AS A SUICIDAL BLACK 
EXACTLY HE IS TWENTY FIVE POINTS BEHIND HE 
LOOKS AT THE BLACK YES HE CAN POT 
THE BLACK BUT HE NEEDS ALL BALLS 
OFF THE TABLE TO WIN THE FRAME THE 
PINK SAFE A VALUABLE SHOT FREE 
THE PINK OFF THE CUSHION HE MAY 
GET THE SNOOKER BEHIND THE PINK 
BUT HE LEADS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN A 
VERY TOUGH SAFETY SHOT REGARDLESS 
ALL OF A SUDDEN ALI CARTER IS IN 
THE FRAME HE HAS GOT A CHANCE THE 
BALLS AND IN THE OPEN TRYING TO 
POT THE BLACK BALL HE MORE OR LESS 
SACRIFICE THE FRAME 
TODAY IT IS 
NOT JUST ABOUT PLAYING WELL IT IS 
CLEAR THINKING 
CLEAR THINKING FORGET ABOUT THE 
SHOT THAT HAD GONE JUST PLAY THIS 
SHOT IN YOUR MIND AND COMMIT TO IT 
SNOOKER'S MARATHON OF THE MIND IS 
ENTERING THE HOME STRAIGHT IF THE 
PLAYERS ARE TIRED THEY WILL NOT 
LET IT SHOW HERE IS M. C. ROB WALKER

ALI'S FIRST FINAL AS PROFESSIONAL 
WHAT AN ACHIEVEMENT JUST TO BE OUT 
THERE WHAT CAN CARTER DO TO CHANGE 
THE DIRECTION OF THIS MATCH 
ANOTHER EIGHT FRAMES TO PLAY 
CALLING THE SHOTS FOR US IT IS THE 
DYNAMIC DUO WILLIE THORNE AND JOHN 
VIRGO 
GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY THE 
BIGGEST OCCASIONAL ALI CARTER'S 
LIFE 
POOR START FROM RONNIE WHAT EVER 
YOU DO DO NOT HAD THE BLUE A 
CHANCE FOR ALI HE NEEDS A GOOD 
START START ABSOLUTELY ALL HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT 
WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO THIS IS HAVE 
THE CHANCE HE MAY HAVE TO PLAY 
WITH LITTLE RIGHT HAND SIDE TO 
SWING TOWARDS THE SECOND RED HE 
WILL STILL BE ON THE BLACK THIS IS 
ONE OF THOSE WE SHOULD NOT PLAY A 
SHOT FOR NOTHING YOU HAVE GOT TO 
GO ALL OUT FOR THIS HE WENT ROUND 
THE BACK OF THEM AM NOT SAYING 
IT IS THE WRONG SHOT BUT IT WAS 
VERY EASY A SHOT TO NOTHING HE HE KNEW THE BLUE WAS UP THERE LANDED 
PERFECTLY ON THE BLUE 
BUT NOW HE NEEDS A GOOD POSITIONAL 
SHOT FOR THE NEXT RED HE NEEDS A 
GOOD LINE AND HE NEEDS A GOOD 
LENGTH 
HE MAY JUST BE ON WANT TO THE LEFT 
CORNER THERE IT IS CANNY SEE 
ENOUGH OF IT CAN HE SEE ENOUGH 
OF IT 
HE HAS DONE THAT QUITE A LOT AT THE 
FINAL HE HAS WRIST GETTING PERFECT 
ON THE BLUE AND THE LOT OF TIMES IT 
HAS BEEN SHORT AS IT HAPPENS THIS 
TIME IT HAS TURNED OUT O. K. 
I CANNOT REMEMBER RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
HIT IN THE BLUE OF THE BREAK OFF 
THIS WEEK 
HIS BREAKS HAVE USUALLY BEEN PRETTY 
GOOD THAT HAS WHAT THAT IS WHAT 
HAS PUT ALI AT THE TABLE PLAYED IT PERFECTLY THAT WAS A FABULOUS SHOT 
HE HAS JUST GOT TO GET THE GAP 
WHEN THE BLACK GOES ON IT SPOT THE 
GAP GET A LITTLE BIT MORE A 
LITTLE BIT MORE SMALLER 
THAT IS A LOT BETTER I WOULD MUCH 
RATHER HIM DO THAT THAN RISK 
GETTING THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BLUE 
IT GIVES YOU SO MANY MORE OPTIONS 
YES I AGREE BUT HE HAS NOT DONE 
GOOD HERE HE NEEDED A NICE ANGLE 
ON THE YELLOW HE HAS NOT GOT THAT 
HE'S LOOKING AT THE GREEN THERE 
THAT IS NOT AN EASY SHOT HE MAY 
HAVE A PROBLEM HERE 
LET HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT HE IS 
PLAYING THAT IS WE HE NEEDS TO GET 
THE CUE BALL LET ALSO HAVE LOOK 
HE HAS GOT TO COME DOWN TOWARDS THE 
CIRCLE IT NEEDS TO RUN 
HE MAY JUST BE ON IT IF HE IS 
THAT IS A VERY GOOD SHOT 
HE HAS 
JUST COME ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO 
SCREW IT ROUND TWO CUSHIONS THE 
GREEN WAS DIFFICULT 
THINGS ARE OPENING UP NICELY NOW 
HE WILL TRY AND GET RID OF THE RED 
THAT IS NEAR THE BLACK 
IT WAS A BIT OF A RISK COMING OFF 
THE SIDE CUSHION THE LAST THING HE 
NEEDS IS TO BE TOO STRAIGHT ON THIS 
BLACK L. THINK HE HAS GOT LITTLE 
BIT OF AN ANGLE THERE ARE CERTAIN 
EVENT 
THAT WILL 
GO INTO THE LEFT 
CORNER CAN HE FORCED ROUND OFF TWO 
CUSHIONS TO GET ON THAT RED HE IS 
TOO STRAIGHT CAN HE FORCED ROUND 
THAT IS SLIP 
TRYING TO FORCE IT ROUND YOU WON'T 
SEE THIS ONE VERY OFTEN L. L. THINK WE 
WILL CORLISS THE JACK IN THE BOX 
SHOT HELLO WE WILL CALL THIS 
THE JACK IN THE BOX SHOT 
I HAVE 
SEEN THE BALL WELL DOWN THE CUSHION 
AND GO IN THE MIDDLE POCKET BUT I 
HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEN BEFORE THAT'S A BIT CARELESS I THINK THE YELLOW COVERS THE RED 
THAT HAS GONE A FOOT AND A HALF IN 
THE AIR ALI CARTER FOUND IT 
AMUSING HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN 
BEMUSED HAD THE BLACK GONE ON THE 
FOURTH BUT THE GOOD SAFETY SHOT COULD 
HAVE CAUSED AN OPENING RONNIE HAS 
PLAYED A GOOD LENGTH THERE HAS THE 
BLUE COME TO HIS RESCUE THAT WAS A 
TOUGH SAFETY SHOT TO PLAY THAT IS 
A GOOD SHOT 
AND DON'T LET ANY OF THOSE REDS IN 
THE MIDDLE OF WILL GO 
INTO THE LEFT CORNER I DON'T 
KNOW IF ANY OF THOSE REDS 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO IN OFF DEAR 
ME HOW CLOSE WAS THAT 
YOU JUST FELT IT WAS GOING TO DROP 
TOUGH SHOT FROM RONNIE NOW 
THE BLUE HAS NOT COME TO HIS RESCUE 
NOW SO THERE MAY WELL BE A GAP FOR 
THIS RED 
FORTY N. T. S. THE LEAD ANOTHER FORTY AND HE WILL HAVE WON THE FRAME 
THAT IS WHY I THOUGHT HE MIGHT RISK 
PLAYING FOR THE BLACK HE IS USED 
TO BELONG STUN SHOT HE IS PLAYING 
FOR GAPS WITH THIS LONG RUN THROUGH 
BUT IT MADE THE POT MORE DIFFICULT 
IF HE HAD PLAYED THE STUNNED OVER 
FOR THE BLACK I THINK HE WOULD 
HAVE POTTED THE RED WITHOUT ANY 
PROBLEM 
ALI CARTER WILL BE KICKING HIMSELF 
THAT HE HAS BROUGHT THE BLACK IN TO 
PLAY THIS BREAK WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
LOT 
TOUGHER WITH 
THE BLACK OUT OF 
COMMISSION IT WAS A RELATIVELY 
STRAIGHTFORWARD RED HE MISSED IN 
FAIRNESS O'SULLIVAN IN MY HUMBLE 
OPINION THIS IS HIS WORST MATCH SO 
FAR AND HE IS STILL A LEADING ELEVEN TO FIVE 
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT CLOSER 
HE IS NOT OFF THE LAUNCH PAD FOR 
ME YET IN THIS FINAL L. THOUGHT HE 
COULD HOLD THIS RED AND STUN ACROSS 
FOR THE BLACK OR PINK HE MADE IT 
INTO A LOT MORE DIFFICULT PLAYING 
THE RUN THROUGH HE MADE IT A LOT 
MORE DIFFICULT 
A LITTLE QUESTION FOR YOU JOHN 
BEING ABLE TO PLAY THAT 
PROFICIENTLY WITH THE REST HOW 
MANY FRAMES DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD 
WIN HIM IF HE USED THE REST WHERE 
IF USE THE REST HE WOULDN'T DO I I DON'T KNOW THEY HAVE BEEN SOME 
VERY GOOD REST PLAYERS JIMMY WHITE 
SPRINGS TO MIND BUT ANO THE POINT 
YOU'RE MAKING SOME OF THE SHOTS 
WHICH HE PLAYS LEFT HANDED WITH HIS 
HAND ON THE TABLE YOU JUST FEEL HE 
IS STRUGGLING IF A BIT USING THE 
REST 
IT IS 
A GREAT ADVANTAGE TO 
HAVE I KNOW THERE OH TWO ARE MAKING 
WHEN HE FIRST CAME HERE AND USED 
THE LEFT HAND THE CANADIAN 
COMPLAINED AND SAID IT WAS 
DISRESPECTFUL IT IS FUNNY HOW 
THINGS CHANGE 
YES IN FAIRNESS I 
THINK WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS UNTIL 
WE REALISED HOW GOOD HE WAS LEFT 
HANDED 
I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS HANDED DISRESPECTFUL L. L. JUST THOUGHT IT 
WAS SOMETHING IN YOUR ARMOURY IF 
YOU CAN USE IT USE IT THERE IS A 
SURPRISE SO ALI CARTER MUST HAVE 
GONE BACK TO HIS SEAT THINKING I 
HAVE LOST ANOTHER FRAME WHEN I HAVE 
HAD A CHANCE TO WIN IT BUT RONNIE 
MISSES A TRICKY RED ALONG THE TOP 
CUSHION 
SEVENTEEN POINTS THE LEAD STILL GOING TO 
NEED THREE OF THE REMAINING REDS 
SO IT IS NOT A FORMALITY 
YES HE 
WILL BE PLAYING THE STOMACH FOR THE 
RED IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER HE HAS 
TO MAKE SURE THE WHITE DOESN'T GO 
TOO NEAR THE RED TO HAMPER HIS 
CUEING IDEALLY IF HE IS 
ON THE 
ONE 
IN THE 
BILL 
I WOULD 
GET 
RID OF 
THAT NOW 
BECAUSE THEN 
THAT MAKES 
IT 
A LITTLE BIT EASIER IN THE 
MIDDLE 
HE HAS GOT 
TO PLAY THE ONE MIDDLE TO THE MIDDLE AS YOU SAY WILLIE 
IT IS AN AWKWARD RED AND HE 
COULDN'T LAND ON IT BETTER 
DEAR ME IT IS AMAZING ISN'T IT 
AND IT CAN ONLY BE PRESSURE IT 
CAN'T BE ANYTHING ELSE 
I NEARLY FELL OFF MY SEAT THERE I 
COULDN'T IMAGINE HIM MISSING OUT 
JUST APPEARS TO BE BRIDGE TOO FAR 
AT THE MINUTE FOR ALI CARTER HE 
HAS PLAYED SUCH WONDERFUL SNOOKER 
ALL WEEK MAKE NO MISTAKE AS WE 
HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED RONNIE HAS 
BEEN NOWHERE NEAR HIS BEST IN THIS 
FINAL BUT WE KNOW HE CAN SUDDENLY 
TURN IT ON AS HE DID AGAINST EVEN 
HENDRY IN THE SESSION WHEN HE WON 
ALL EIGHT GOOD POT NEEDED AND GOOD 
POT GOT THERE 
HERE IS THE RED THAT LET RONNIE 
BACKING WHEN WE SAY ABOUT PRESSURE 
HE HAS FORGOT THAT RED HE IS JUST 
THINKING ABOUT THE POSITION YOUR 
HEAD IS JUST NOT WORKING RIGHT 
ONLY PRESSURE DOES THAT TO YOU IN 
PRACTICE YOU DON'T EVEN THINK 
ABOUT THEM SHOTS IT IS THE 
OCCASION HE NEEDS THE CHANCE HE 
IS JUST LOOKING TOO FAR AHEAD AND 
IT COST HIM THIS FRAME AND IT WAS 
A FRAME LAST NIGHT WHEN HE MISSED 
AN EASY YELLOW FOR EXACTLY THE SAME 
REASONS 
ON TWO OCCASIONS HE HAS REASONS LOST THREE ON THE TROT THIS WILL 
BE THE FIRST TIME HE HAS LOST FOUR 
ON THE TROT WHAT YOU WOULDN'T GIVE 
FOR A RUN OF FOUR FRAMES IN A ROW 
TO GET HIM BACK WHAT HE WOULDN'T 
GIVE IT JUST BILLS YOUR CONFIDENCE 
UP HE IS NODDING HIS HEAD IN HIS 
CHAIR HE CAN'T BELIEVE THE 
MISTAKES HE HAS MADE IN THIS FRAME 
IT BUILDS YOUR CONFIDENCE 
WELL ANOTHER FRAME AWAY CARTER HAS 
HAD CHANCES HANGS HIS HEAD IN 
SHAME IT CAN HAPPEN TO THE BEST OF 
THEM IT IS ANOTHER FRAME THAT 
RONNIE WILL WALK BACK THINKING HOW 
DID I WIN AT THE ROCKET GOES 
ANOTHER FRAME AHEAD THIS TIME IT 
IS TWELVE TO FIVE 
IT JUST SHOWS YOU WHAT THE PRESSURE 
OF THIS SITUATION CAN DO WHAT DID 
WE LEARN ABOUT BOTH MEN FROM THAT 
OPENING FRAME 
THAT RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN IS DONE IN FANTASTIC 
SHAPE WHEN IT 
COMES TO 
CLEARING 
BALLS UP 
HE MAY 
NOT HAVE THICK 
FORM 
BUT THERE 
HAS NEVER BEEN A 
PLAYER LIKE 
HIM 
FOR MOPPING 
UP WHEN 
THE OTHER PLAYER MISSES IT WAS A 
DESPERATE MISS FROM ALI'S 
PERSPECTIVE IT LOOKS A BIT MORE 
DIFFICULT WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING A 
SHOT THAN IT DOES 
SOMETIMES ON 
THE 
CAMERAS BUT IT WAS STILL VERY 
VERY GET A BALL 
HE IS ALREADY IN 
FRONT HE JUST NEEDS TO POT THE 
LOOSE REDS WITH THE COLOURS AND HE 
WILL WIN A FRAME TO GET A GOOD 
START TO MISS THAT YOU CAN'T 
SEE 
WAS IT BACK OF CONVENT SEE CONCENTRATION OR WHAT 
I REALLY 
DON'T KNOW IT DIDN'T LIKE THERE 
WAS ANY POSITIONAL PROBLEMS A LOT 
OF THE TIMES THE TOP PROS MISS A 
BALL IS BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO 
GET POSITION BUT 
THAT LOOKED 
MORE 
LESS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION IT 
MAYBE 
HE JUST 
TOOK IT FOR GRANTED 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK ALI WHO 
KNOWS 
HE WAS SITTING THERE JUST AS KNOWS THEY WERE RE BACKING THE BALLS AND 
HE LOOKED A LITTLE BIT LOST I HAVE 
TO SAY WE WRACKING IT LOOKS 
LIKE IT IS ALL OVER IN THIS FINAL 
YES NOT THE BEST BREAK OF WHEN 
ALI WALKED BACK TO THE TABLE HE 
WAS SO DISAPPOINTED HE HAS GOT TO 
BE PROUD OF HIMSELF JOHN HASN'T 
HE HE HAS GOT TO THE FINAL OF A 
MAJOR HE HAS MADE A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
GREAT OPENING RED FROM RONNIE JUST 
ABOUT GOT A SLIGHT ANGLE ON THE 
BLUE BUT THERE IS A RED IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE TABLE TO THE LEFT OF 
THE PINK HE CAN PLAY ON L. REMEMBER 
WHEN YOU PLAYED WILLIE YOU WERE 
NOT THAT ANIMATED BUT CERTAIN 
PEOPLE OFF HE MUST 
HIS PERFORMANCE 
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT 
IT IS 
THE BIGGEST MATCH OF HIS LIFE AND 
HE'S JUST SO DISAPPOINTED 
I FEEL 
FOR 
HIM BUT 
THAT'S THE NATURE OF 
FOR HIM BUT THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE 
GAME YOU 
HAVE GOT 
TO POT 
BALLS 
ONES LIKE 
HE 
DID IN 
THE 
LAST FRAME 
AND THE 
YELLOW 
BACK TO 
IT 
THAT HE MISSED LAST NIGHT THEY ARE 
SCARS AT A VERY DIFFICULT TO GET 
OVER 
IT HAPPENS TO THE BEST OF OVER THEM THE GREAT JOHN PARROTT LOST A 
MATCH EIGHTEEN TO THREE DAVIS THAT IS GOING TO 
GIVE YOU SCARS BUT HE STILL WON 
PLENTY OF TOURNAMENTS THIS WAS THE 
YELLOW JOHN WAS TALKING ABOUT 
YESTERDAY EVENING THERE IS TWO 
FRAMES WE HAVE SEEN ALL OF A 
SUDDEN THE SCORE BECOMES TEN TO SEVEN 
INSTEAD OF TWELVE TO FIVE AND THERE HAVE 
BEEN ANOTHER COUPLE OF FRAMES 
HAVEN'T THERE JOHN 
COULD MAKE HIM A STRONGER PERSON 
HE WILL LEARN LOT ABOUT HIMSELF 
IN THIS MATCH LET'S HOPE THE GET 
THE BENEFIT FROM IT LET'S HOPE HE 
CAN TURN IT ROUND IN THE NEAR 
FUTURE NO ONE WANTS TO SEE ANYONE 
STRUGGLING 
AND HAVING A CLOSE LOOK STRUGGLING AT HIS EYES THERE JOHN FOR ME 
THEY ARE LITTLE BIT WATERY MAYBE 
HE'S SO FRUSTRATED WITH HIMSELF IT 
ALMOST FEELS LIKE HE WANTS TO CRY 
I DON'T BLAME HIM BECAUSE HE JUST 
KNOWS HE IS NOT PRODUCING AND HE 
HAS GOT RONNIE PROBABLY AS BAD HE 
IS GOING TO BE AT THE MOMENT THE 
WAY HE HAS PLAYED THESE LAST SEVENTEEN 
DAYS 
LOOKING FOR AN ANGLE ON THE BLUE 
BUT HE HAS NOT GOT MUCH OF ONE 
THERE MAY BE IN BED INTO THE RIGHT 
CORNER RED TRYING TO FORCE 
THE CUE BALL ACROSS SO HE THINKS 
HE IS ON THIS RED 
JUST MISJUDGED IT NO BAD CONTACT 
HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO CLIP OFF 
ONE RED BUT THEN HE CLIPPED OF THE 
THIRD RED 
AND THAT 
IS 
WHY HE 
HAS 
RUN OUT OF POSITION JUST A SAFETY 
TO PLAY HE CAUGHT ONE RED AND THEN 
HE CAUGHT 
THE OTHER THAT JUST TOOK OUT OF THE CUE BALL 
EVEN THOUGH HE LEADS BY FOUR FORTY FIVE 
HE WAS RELUCTANT TO PUT THE BLACK 
OUT OF PLAY THESE CAN GO WRONG IF 
HE IS PLAYING A THIN SAFETY SHOT 
HIS AIM WAS DEATHLY TO WIN AT LEAST 
TWO FRAMES IN THE SESSION TO TAKE 
US INTO THE EVENING SESSION I'M 
JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH HIS 
BODY LANGUAGE THAT HE DOESN'T FANCY 
IT AT ALL AT THE MINUTE HE HAS 
REALLY GOT TO DIG HIMSELF OUT OF 
THIS 
LITTLE HOLE 
HE IS IN AT THE 
THIS LITTLE HOLE HE IS IN AT THE MOMENT 
ONCE AGAIN NOT GOT THE MOMENT RIGHT ANGLE ON THE BLUE BUT THERE 
IS A RED AT THE END OF THE CLUSTER 
THAT WILL 
GO INTO 
THE RIGHT 
CORNER 
SO HE 
DIDN'T 
HAVE TO 
DO A 
LOT WITH 
THE CUE 
BALL THIS 
IS 
THE TYPE 
OF 
SHOT WE TALK ABOUT MOST PEOPLE 
WOULD HAVE TO GET THE REST HERE 
BUT NOT RONNIE LEFT HANDED SO SO THIS WITH THE REST WOULD PROBABLY 
BE SIX OR SEVEN OUT OF TEN AND NOW 
IT 
OUT 
OF TEN 
SO 
IT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE 
NO HELP FROM ALI CARTER THIS TIME 
APART FROM THAT LOOSE SAFETY BUT 
THAT CAN HAPPEN ANY TIME SO RONNIE 
WINNING THIS FRAME AND DOING IT 
QUITE COMFORTABLY HYPOTHETICALLY HYPOTHETICALLY JOHN WHAT KIND OF STANDARD WOULD 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN BE LEFT HANDED 
COULD HE BE A TOP THIRTY TWO PLAYER HE HE PLAYED PETER EBDON LEFT HANDED AND 
BEAT HIM BECAUSE HE WAS NOT HAPPY 
WITH THE WAY HE WAS PLAYING RIGHT 
HANDED 
ALMOST TOP SIXTEEN THEN 
YES I HANDED LITTLE EMBARRASSING FOR PETER BUT 
PETER SAID WHAT CAN I DO HE NEVER 
MISSED BALL 
APPLAUSE FROM THE CROWD THIS FRAME 
IS OVER 
APPLAUSE FROM THE 
BIG 
IF HE HAS BEEN 
HE HAS DONE IT ON THE PRACTICE 
TABLE AND IT IS NOT HAPPENING ON 
THE MATCH TABLE 
THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO SEE THE CUE 
BALL COMING ROUND OF THE TWO 
CUSHIONS IN BETWEEN THE PINK AND 
BLUE OFF THE TWO CUSHIONS A 
GOOD ONE IS WHEN IT NESTLES TIGHTER 
GETS THE BAULK CUSHION RONNIE HAS 
OVERHIT THAT SOMEWHAT HE HAS LEFT 
A POSSIBLE POT ON NOW COME ON 
ALI HAVE WE GOT ANY ABILITY TO 
BOUNCE BACK 
THIS CAPACITY CRUCIBLE AUDIENCE 
WANTS TO SEE ALI MAKE SOME SORT OF 
A COMEBACK THAT WILL GIVE HIM A 
LITTLE BIT OF CONFIDENCE THE FACT 
THAT HE 
IS DEAD 
STRAIGHT 
ON THE 
BLUE AS WELL HE COULD EASILY PLAY 
THE RED TO THE LEFT OF THE PINK 
HERE 
WE WERE LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN THE 
BARREL IT IS ALL ABOUT THE RED ON 
THE BLACK SPOT IF THE RED IS 
COVERING THE BLACK THAT COULD 
CAUSE A PROBLEM 
HE WANTED THE RED NEXT TO THE BLACK 
TO GO HE HAS PLAYED NICE SHOT THERE 
THAT'S O. K. THAT WAS NICELY PLAYED 
IT IS A CHANCE THIS TO WIN THE 
FRAME IN ONE VISIT TO RE ESTABLISH 
A LITTLE BIT OF CONFIDENCE 
YES OF 
THE FIVE FRAMES HE HAS WON HE HAS 
WON THREE OF THEM IN ONE VISIT HE 
HAD A BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED FOUR IN THE FOURTH FRAME 
HE FELT HE COULD JUST ROLE IT IN 
THIS IS THE KEY SHOT IF HE GETS ON 
A RED NICELY TO GET ON THE BLACK 
HE SHOULD WIN THE FRAME 
PERFECT POSITION BUT WILL TAKE 
NOTHING FOR GRANTED 
TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANCE 
BECAUSE HE KNEW BY OPENING UP THAT 
RED HE WOULD OPEN THREE OTHERS 
INTO PLAY HE IS SNOOKERED THE ONE 
SNOOKERED HIMSELF ON THE ONE HE 
WANTED TO GO FOR 
ONCE AGAIN ALI HAS BEEN IN FIRST 
WITH THE BALLS PERFECT 
THERE WAS 
NOT A LOT OF CONVICTION ON THAT 
SHOT AS SOON AS HE HIT THE RED HE 
WAS WALKING BACK TO HIS SEAT A 
GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND LIKE SO MANY 
IT HAS GONE 
A REPRIEVE RONNIE NOT HAPPY TRIED 
TO PINCH A LITTLE BIT OF THE POCKET 
THERE 
TO GET 
GOOD POSITION ON THE 
THERE TO GET GOOD POSITION ON THE BLACK TRIED TO JUST PINCH A LITTLE 
BIT AND PROBABLY PLAYED WITH A 
TRACE OF SIDE YOU CAN MAKE ANY POT 
MISSABLE SO ALI YOU HAVE GOT 
ANOTHER CHANCE 
AT THIS LEVEL YOU HAPPY WITH ONE 
CHANCE A FRAME YOU ARE HAPPY 
WITH ONE CHANCE THIS WILL BE 
DELIGHTED ALI CARTER WHO HAS HAD 
SECOND CHANCE IN THE FRAME IF HE 
DOESN'T WIN IT FROM HERE WE ARE IN 
TROUBLE JUST ONE MORE RED AND 
COLOUR 
OH IT HAS GONE WRONG IT HAS GONE 
WRONG HE SIXTY THREE POINTS IN FRONT THERE 
IS STILL SIXTY SEVEN ON THE TABLE HE HAS 
NOT GOT ON THE BLACK HE IS 
HAMPERED BADLY HE HAS GOT TO PLAY 
SAFE AND TRY AND KNOCK A COLOUR 
NEAR A CUSHION 
A DO YOU NOT RISK 
THE BLUE TO GO SIXTY EIGHT IN FRONT 
HAMPERED LIKE THAT DON'T THINK SO 
I WOULD RATHER PLAY OFF ONE OF THE 
BAULK COLOURS TRIAN ROCKET OFF THE 
SIDE CUSHION LEAVE IT FOR 
INSURANCE LATER TRY AND KNOCK IT 
OFF THE SIDE CUSHION 
HE WAS NOT IN A POSITION WHERE HE 
SHOULD RUN OUT OF POSITION IT WAS 
A STRAIGHTFORWARD RED HE SHOULD 
ONLY HAVE NEEDED A RED AND A COLOUR 
WELL THAT MISTAKE COME BACK TO 
HAUNT HIM WILL THAT MISTAKE CUE 
THE SHOT OF THE AFTERNOON THE SHOT 
OF THE SESSION WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT 
THE HARDEST SHOT IN THE GAME THAT 
WAS A GREAT SHOT AT DISTANCE MADE 
TO LOOK RIDICULOUSLY EASY 
ANOTHER EXCELLENT POT PLAYED LEFT 
HANDED HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT GREEN 
BALL GOING TO BE IN THIS FRAME 
MASSIVE HAVE YOU LET ANOTHER ONE SLIP ALI 
THIRTY NINE POINTS BEHIND POSSIBLE FORTY THREE LEFT 
ON THE TABLE 
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE TRIED TO 
MOVE THE GREEN IF HE POTS THE 
GREEN HE WILL NEED A SNOOKER HE 
IS LOOKING AT THE SCOREBOARD IF HE 
POTS THE GREEN HE WILL ONLY BE 
ABLE TO TIE HE HAS THIRTY A POINTS 
BEHIND AT THE MOMENT IF HE POTS 
THE GREEN HE WILL GO THIRTY FIVE BEHIND 
THIRTY EIGHT POINTS THAT IS WHY HE WENT FOR 
THE BROWN AND HE HAS MISSED IT 
ALI CARTER WILL BE COMING TO THE 
TABLE A VERY RELIEVED YOUNG MAN HE 
IS THIRTY EIGHT POINTS IN FRONT RONNIE NEEDS 
A SNOOKER 
IT WENT RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE 
POCKET 
MISSED THE BLACK BUT IT WILL NOT 
MATTER RONNIE NOT THAT IS IN OFF 
ALI CARTER ONCE AGAIN DID NOT KILL 
THE LINE IN ONE HIT GAVE RONNIE 
THE CHANCE TO COME BACK THIS TIME 
HE DIDN'T 
AT LEAST THAT HAS BROKEN THE 
PATTERN THE LAST FEW FRAMES ALI 
HAS MADE FORTY OR FIFTY AND THEN RONNIE 
HAS IN AN CLEANED UP 
IT MAY BE RONNIE WHO HAS BROKEN THE 
SPELL FOR HIM BY MATHEMATICALLY 
GETTING IT WRONG IN THE END RONNIE 
EFFECTIVELY THROUGH THE FRAME AWAY 
EVEN THOUGH ALI HAD THE FIRST 
CHANCE CHANCE CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT IT WHAT IT 
IS LIKE TO CHASE IN THE FINAL 
THE PROBLEM HE HAS GOT HIS HE IS 
MENTALLY VERY TIRED WHEN I WAS 
BEATEN BY STEVE IN THE FINAL HE WAS 
PLAYING SUPREMELY WELL AND I WAS 
MENTALLY GONE THAT IS RECIPE FOR 
DISASTER BOTH PLAYERS ARE NOT AT 
THEIR BEST AT THE MOMENT ALI 
CARTER HAS JUST GOT TO TRY TO PLAY 
EVERY FRAME AND NOT LOOK AT THE 
SCOREBOARD THAT IS ALL HE CAN DO 
NOT THE BEST BREAK OFF FROM ALI 
CARTER IF THIS WAS TIGHT ON THE 
CUSHION RONNIE WOULD NOT TAKE THIS 
ON BUT HE COULD CERTAINLY GET THE 
CUE ON THE TABLE IT IS DECISION 
TIME DO YOU PLAY FOR THE BLACK 
WOULD BE A PLAY FOR A BAULK COLLAR 
OR DO YOU PLAY FOR A COLOUR 
HE HAS COME ROUND TO HAVE A LOOK AT 
THE BLACK 
THESE SHOT TO GIVE YOU SO MUCH 
CONFIDENCE IF YOU PUT THEM IN HOW 
HAS IT NOT GONE IN RONNIE'S FACIAL 
EXPRESSION THERE WAS A PICTURE 
UNBELIEVABLE KNOCKED THREE TIMES 
DID NOT KNOW THE PASSWORD HE COULD 
NOT HAVE BEEN ANY CLOSER JUST THAT 
LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA PACE LITTLE 
BIT SLOWER AND GRAVITY WOULD HAVE 
TAKEN OVER 
HOT THAT BALL DOES NOT WANT TO GO 
IN THAT POCKET THAT BALL DOES NOT WANT TO GO IN THAT POCKET 
AMAZING I HAVE A FEELING HERE THE 
BALLS OR ABSOLUTELY PERFECT ARE 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
THIS WILL BE INTERESTING HE HAS 
GOT THE CHOICE OF REDS HERE HE IS 
GETTING RID OF THE ONE THAT GIVES 
PLENTY OF ROOM TO GET AROUND THE 
BLACK IT IS ALL ABOUT THE RED JUST 
BELOW THE PACK HE WOULD LIKE TO 
GET ON THAT IN THE WAY HE CAN PLAY 
A LITTLE STUN RUN THROUGH TO BRING 
ALL THE REDS INTO PLAY HE WILL BE 
GETTING RID OF IT SOON 
HE HAS DEVELOPED THE PINK NICELY 
MY FEELINGS HAVE NEVER BEEN GOOD 
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SUGGEST HE IS 
MASSIVE FAVOURITE NOW TO WIN HER 
THE FRAME MARK ANOTHER FRAME 
ALI CARTER HAS TO WIN AT LEAST ONE 
MORE FRAME TO TAKE US INTO THE 
EVENING SESSION ANOTHER FRAME 
THIS IS THE LAST FRAME BEFORE THE 
MID SESSION INTERVAL FOUR MORE TO 
BE PLAYED THIS AFTERNOON THE 
REMAINDER OF THIS EVENING FROM 
PRIDE ABU ALI WILL WANT TO TAKE IT 
INTO THE FINAL SESSION FROM AT 
PRIDE POINT OF VIEW ALI WILL WANT 
TO TAKE IT INTO THE FINAL SESSION 
THAT WAS THE SHOT I WAS TALKING 
ABOUT EARLIER SOMETIMES YOU CAN 
USE THE PACK TO HOLD THE WHITE HE 
DID THAT ON THE LAST POSITIONAL 
SHOT THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
SHOCKS IN BREAK BUILDING SHOPS 
SOMETIMES YOU CAN FINISH ON THE 
CUSHION BUT MORE TIMES YOU WOULD 
COME ON AND OFF THE CUSHION WITH 
THAT SHOT THIS IS THE WORLD FINAL 
REMEMBER AND NINETY FOUR PER CENT POT SUCCESS RATE 
HE HAS NOT PLAYED ANYWHERE NEAR AS 
GOOD AS HE DID AGAINST STEPHEN 
HENDRY AND IT IS STILL NINETY FOUR PER CENT IN 
NINETY FOUR PER CENT POT SUCCESS RATE NINETY FOUR PER CENT POT 
SUCCESS RATE 
SO THE BLACK TO GO SEVENTY IN FRONT 
WOULD SEVENTY FIVE REMAINING WITH SEVENTY FIVE 
REMAINING HE HAS GOT ONE RED TO 
THE LEFT MIDDLE L. THINK IT JUST 
GOES THE RED TO GO SEVENTY ONE AHEAD WITH 
ONLY SIXTY SEVEN REMAINING 
SO EVERY FRIEND THIS SESSION ALI 
CARTER HAS BEEN IN THE BALLS THIS 
CROWD CAN ONLY LOOK ON AND HOPE 
THAT HE IS GOING TO MAKE OUR COME 
THAT HE IS GOING TO MAKE A MATCH OF 
IT IT LOOKS LIKE RONNIE HAS BROKEN 
DOWN AT SEVENTY ONE AND BARRING SNOOKERS 
ALI CARTER WILL BE FOURTEEN TO SIX BEHIND 
ONE SNOOKER TO TIE 
THAT IS THE FRAME OVER WITH MID 
SESSION INTERVAL COMING UP WITH AN 
EIGHT FRAME ADVANTAGE THAT IS A 
BIG LEAD 
YES HE CAME INTO THIS 
SESSION LEADING ELEVEN TO FIVE HE WAS ONE TO 
ONE HUNDRED WITH THE BOOK MAKERS THERE 
WILL BE NO OFFER HAS NOW YOU WOULD 
HAVE TO PUT ONE HUNDRED ON TO WIN ONE ALI 
CARTER GOES INTO THE INTERVAL 
TRAILING BY FOURTEEN TO SIX 
IT IS LOOKING GOOD FOR O'SULLIVAN 
HE NEEDS FOUR MORE FRAMES TO WIN 
HIS THIRD WORLD TITLE ALI CARTER 
CUT DISCONSOLATE FIGURE NOT THE 
START HE WANTED HE LOOKED LITTLE 
MORE ALL FOR IT BUT NOT THE WAY HE 
HAD PLANNED THE OPENING PART OF 
THIS AFTERNOON'S SESSION HOW ARE 
YOU READ THE WAY THINGS STAND 
HE IS DEFINITELY JADED ALI RONNIE 
HAS NOT BEEN AT HIS BEST BUT I WAS 
NOT EXPECTING HIM TO BE THE 
PERFORMANCE AGAINST HENDRY WAS 
STUPENDOUS DIFFICULT TO RECREATE 
THAT HE IS DOING ENOUGH ALI IS 
NOT QUITE AT HIS GAME IT WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTING IT IS HIS FIRST 
RANKING FINAL IT IS THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP YOU WANT TO DO YOUR 
BEST BEST DO YOU SENSE RONNIE MIGHT BE 
SENSING THE FINISH LINE CLOSER THAN 
WE MIGHT IMAGINE COULD BE TIED UP 
THIS AFTERNOON 
A YES I THINK HE SMELLS THE KILL 
IF YOU MAKE THE ANALOGY WITH A 
BOXING MATCH ALI CARTER IS ON THE 
ROPES AND HIS HANDS ARE BY HIS SIDE 
IT WILL TAKE A HUGE EFFORT FOR 
THERE TO BE AND THE TURNAROUND THE 
OTHER GUY IS IN THE ASCENDANCY NO 
REAL WAY BACK 
WE WILL SEE HOW THEY FARE WHEN THEY 
COME BACK IN THE MEANTIME LET US 
REFLECT LITTLE BIT ON THE 
CHANGING FACE OF SNOOKER IT HAS 
BEEN A VERY ENTERTAINING SEASON OF 
SNOOKER SO FAR THAT IS POSSIBLY 
BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF NEW FACES 
COMING THROUGH 
IN THE WORLD OF SNOOKER WE PAY 
PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE 
PUBLICATION OF THE RANKING LIST 
THIS IS BROUGHT TOGETHER AT THE END 
OF THE SEASON AND CULMINATE WITH 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP THE MAIN 
FOCUS WHO IS GOING TO BE IN THE 
TOP SIXTEEN BEING A MEMBER OF THE TOP 
SIXTEEN IS IF YOU CALL FOR EVERY 
PROFESSIONAL PLAYER IT GUARANTEES 
ENTRY INTO THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
IS HUGE GOLFER EVERY 
PROFESSIONAL PLAYER SECONDLY 
SOMETHING YOU CAN TAKE TO THE BANK 
YOU RECEIVE PASSES TO THE LABOUR 
STAGES OF EVERY RANKING TOURNAMENT 
AND FINALLY YOU RECEIVE AN 
INVITATION TO THE MASTERS AT THE 
WEMBLEY ARENA THE RANKING IS 
COMPILED OVER ROLLING TWO YEAR 
PERIOD IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP SIXTEEN 
FOR THIS SEASON THERE HAVE BEEN 
SOME MAJOR CASUALTIES KEN DOHERTY 
HAS FALLEN OUT OF THE ELITE GROUP 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTEEN SEASONS 
MARK WILLIAMS WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE 
HIS RESURGENCE FROM OUTSIDE THE TOP 
SIXTEEN STEPHEN LEE FIXTURE IN THIS 
COMPANY FOR ALMOST A DECADE DROPS 
OUT TO DESPITE TO UPSET TOO 
STEVE DAVIS BIDS FAREWELL DESPITE 
ACHIEVING HIS AMBITION OF BEING 
NUMBER OF THE TOP SIXTEEN AT THE AGE OF 
FIFTY THEY WERE JOINED JIMMY WHITE 
THE PRESSURE CAN BE OVERWHELMING 
WITNESS MARK ALAN'S REACTION 
FOLLOWING HIS FIRST ROUND DEFEAT 
AGAINST STEPHEN HENDRY 
I THINK OUT 
COST MYSELF THE TOP SIXTEEN PLACE WHICH 
IS THE MOST DISAPPOINTING THING I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WILL DO 
FORTUNATELY MADE THE SIXTEEN ON OTHER 
RESULTS WENT HIS WAY STEPHEN LEE 
WAS NOT QUITE SO LUCKY 
FORTUNATELY HE MADE IT THE TOP SIXTEEN 
I DESERVE TO BE OUT OF THE TOP SIXTEEN 
BEWARE PLAYED L. HAVE JUST HAD 
ENOUGH THE WAY I HAVE PLAYED 
AM NOT SURE WHAT GAME IS GOING TO 
TURN UP L. HAVE HAD ENOUGH 
HE KNOWS IF HE LOSES THIS FRAME HE 
WILL HAVE TO QUALIFY TO GET TO 
SHEFFIELD NEXT SEASON 
I REALLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 
A WHERE IT HAS ALL GONE WRONG A 
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I WAS AT THE 
TOP OF THE RANKINGS AND NOW I'M OUT 
OF THE SIXTEEN 
ONE SURPRISINGLY STEVE DAVIS TOOK 
A MORE MEASURED APPROACH TO HIS 
DEMOTION MAC ONE SURPRISINGLY 
THE PROSPECT OF PLAYING IN THE 
QUALIFYING SECTION AARON SOME WAYS 
AT CHALLENGE IS IN SOMEWHERE 
TALENTS YOU WOULD RATHER NOT BUT 
YOU HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO THAT 
TALENT FOR ME I HAVE GOT BACK IN 
ONCE BEFORE IT WILL BE HARDER TO 
GET BACK IN AGAIN IT IS NOT AS 
MUCH OF A DISAPPOINTMENT AS IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN FIVE YEARS AGO 
THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD PLAYERS 
OUTSIDE THE TOP SIXTEEN NOW YOU'RE IN 
GOOD COMPANY 
IT WILL BE WEIRD TURNING UP AT 
QUALIFYING AND SEEING KEN STEVE 
LEE STEVE DAVIS 
THE PROVISIONAL LIST FOR NEXT 
SEASON SEES FOUR NEW NAMES OF 
REPLACING THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN OUT 
AND THERE ARE NUMBER OF RISING 
STARS ARE WE WITNESSING AT 
CHANGING OF THE GUARD 
THE NEW BRAT 
PACK IS SHOWING QUITE BIG ON THE 
RICHTER SCALE THERE IS A CHANGING 
OF THE GUARD IT MAY BE THERE IS A 
NEW BREED OF PLAYER COMING THROUGH 
THE OLD PLAYERS EVEN THOUGH THEY 
ARE GREAT PLAYERS THEY ARE NOT 
GOING TO HAVE AT THE WRONG WAY FOR 
A BRAIN MUCH LONGER 
THE PRESSURES OF MAKING THE TOP SIXTEEN 
ARE HARDLY SURPRISING GIVEN THE 
REWARDS AT STAKE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE 
SAME PLAYERS WHEN THE RANKINGS 
URINE YEAR OUT NOT SO NOWADAYS 
YOU'RE IN YEAR OUT NOT SO 
NOWADAYS THAT CAN ONLY BE GOOD FOR 
THE GAME 
AS IF TO UNDERLINE THE ONGOING 
CHANGES THIS IS WHAT IT WILL 
OFFICIALLY BE THERE IS A LITTLE 
BIT OF MOVEMENT IF ALI CARTER WERE 
TO WIN HE WOULD GO OPTED HE WOULD 
CALLED TO NO SIX THERE IS A RE 
ENTRY FOR MARK KING MARCO FU AND 
JOE PERRY MARK WILLIAMS KEN 
DOHERTY STEPHEN LEE AND STEVE 
DAVIS HAVE SLIPPED OUT HOW MUCH 
DOES IT MATTER TO BE IN THE TOP SIXTEEN 
IT MATTERS LESS THAN IT DID THERE 
WERE MORE INVITATION TOURNAMENTS 
BUT IT STILL MATTERS A LOT YOU'RE 
OUT OF THE MASTERS UNLESS YOU CAN 
WIN THE WILD CARD ENTRY YOU'RE 
CERTAINLY AT OF THE CRUCIBLE UNLESS 
HE WINS TRIO QUALIFYING ROUND 
CERTAINLY OUT OF THE CRUCIBLE 
UNLESS YOU WIN YOU A QUALIFYING 
ROUND YOU'RE QUALIFYING ROUND 
YOU QUALIFYING ROUND 
I THINK WHAT 
IS GOING TO BE INTRIGUING WILL BE 
THE FIRST ROUND DRAW AT THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP NEXT YEAR LOOK AT 
SOME OF THE NAMES IN THE QUALIFYING 
SECTION IT IS A WHO'S WHO OF WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS SNOOKER SOME REALLY 
GREAT PLAYERS UNLESS YOU WIN THE 
QUALIFYING ROUND 
AND THAT IS PRESUMING WE WIN THERE 
ARE LOADS OF GOOD PLAYERS WHO WE 
HAVE NOT SEEN ON THE TELEVISION AND 
THEY WILL FANCY PLAYING SOME OF 
THOSE PLAYERS THERE 
ALL THAT TO 
LOOK FORWARD TO NEXT SEASON 
REFLECTING A LITTLE BIT ON THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP WE HAVE SEEN WHAT THIRTY ONE 
MATCHES WE HAVE SEEN THIRTY ONE MATCHES 
THOUSANDS OF SHOPS THESE ARE THE 
ONES THAT DESERVE A CLOSE LOOK 
AGAIN 
HE HAS GOT TO HIT FOUR QUESTIONS 
CUSHIONS BRILLIANT ABSOLUTELY 
BRILLIANT 
YOU WILL NOT SEE MANY BETTER SHOT 
THAN THAT SHOCKS POTS PERFECT HE COULD NOT HAVE HIT THAT BETTER 
YOU WILL NOT SEE A BETTER SAFETY 
SHOT THAN THAT GREAT POT WHAT ABOUT THAT WHAT A GREAT SHOT 
I DIDN'T KNOW IF THE ANGLE IS THERE 
IT WOULD NEED SOME SHOT TO POT THE 
PINK AND COME OFF THE LEFT SIDE 
CUSHION AND GET IN BEHIND THE BLACK 
I DO NOT THINK THE SHOT IS ON HE 
MAY EVEN REFUSED THE POT NO HE 
HAS GONE ALL THE WAY AROUND THE 
HOUSES WHAT A SHOT THIS IS WHAT A SHOT 
SO WE HAVE MADE OUR SELECTION FOR 
THE SHOT OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP IT 
WAS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN'S THIRTY AND 
BLACK IN HIS ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
ALDERSHOT WE HAVE SEEN HAVE BEEN 
GREAT SHOTS BUT JIMMY PINPOINT 
POSITIONAL PLAY TO MAKE A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN AT 
CRUCIBLE 
THE BOARD YOU NEED 
PINPOINT POSITIONAL PLAY 
ANOTHER ACCOLADE FOR THE ESSEX 
GENIUS GENIUS THIS IS THE SILVER CHIP RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN WILL TAKE HOME 
SO NOW FROM SILVER MEDALS AND 
SILVER TROPHIES LET US GO TO GOLD 
MEDALS HERE IS WHAT DAME KELLY 
HOLMES THINKS OF SNOOKER 
MY NAN AND GRANDDAD ALWAYS WATCHED 
THE SNOOKER USED TO ALWAYS GO 
AROUND THEIR HOUSE AT WEEKENDS 
WITHOUT DOUBT THERE WOULD BE 
SNOOKER ON T. V. IT WAS THIRTY ODD YEARS 
AGO NOW THEY WILL BE GLUED TO THE 
SET IF I CAN EVER GET MY GRANDAD 
TO THE CRUCIBLE I WOULD 
ABSOLUTELY HAVING BEEN AN ATHLETE 
COMPETING AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL 
PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE PREPARED FOR 
EVERYTHING BELIEVE ME YOU'RE SO 
FOCUSED ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO BUT 
ULTIMATELY THERE IS THE UNKNOWN 
AHEAD OF YOU AND EVEN THOUGH YOU 
HAVE PRACTISED AND COME THROUGH AND 
COMPETED SO MANY TIMES WHEN IT 
COMES TO SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT TO 
YOU THERE IS NO TURNING BACK 
WALKING DOWN THOSE STAIRS IS 
PROBABLY BIT OF ADRENALIN 
EXCITEMENT NERVES ALTERNATELY 
THEY KNOW IT COULD BE AN OUTCOME 
THAT THEY HAVE WANTED ALL THEIR 
LIFE 
ALL SPORT IS SO DIFFERENT BEING AN 
ATHLETE YOU CANNOT CONTROL WHAT THE 
OTHER ATHLETE DO ALL YOU CAN DO IS 
HAVE YOUR GAME PLAN IN SNOOKER IN 
A WAY YOU HAVE GOT YOUR OPPOSITION 
BUT YOU HAVE ALSO GOT YOUR BALLS 
THE BALLS YOU CANNOT CONTROL THEM 
ALL TIME BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT 
IS GOING TO HAPPEN FOR SNOOKER 
PLAYER TO SIT THERE AND NO THAT 
MUST BE QUITE HARD TO TAKE YOU'RE 
ONLY IN CONTROL WHEN YOU'RE ON THE 
TABLE 
TACTICAL BATTLES I LIKE THE 
TACTICS SIDE OF IT MY FORTE WAS 
TACTICS AT RUNNING L. DID NOT 
ALWAYS LEAD FROM THE FRONT L. CAME FROM THE BACK

PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR GREAT AFFECTION

CHANCES YOU CAN'T REALLY GIVE 
RONNIE THAT KIND OF CHANCE TO GO 
BACK AND SIT IN THE CHAIR MADE A 
BIT OF 
A MISTAKE AND 
HIM CLEANING 
UP IS 
VERY 
TOUGH BUT 
HE

FEW MORE 
FRAMES ON 
THE TABLE THIS AFTERNOON

AMBITION REALISED COME MEETING

SEAT

TERRY HAS GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO 
TODAY WITH ALI SAMMY AND I WERE 
TALKING ABOUT IT YOU GET A LOT OF 
DRAMA ON THE TELEVISION YOU 
GET A 
GREAT SENSE 
AND YOU HAVE THE 
COMMENTARY BUT NOTHING BEATS BEING 
HERE IT IS VERY TENSE THE OTHER 
THING IT IS VERY INTIMATE L. CAN'T 
IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE WHEN THEY 
HAVE GOT TWO TABLES IT IS VERY 
VERY 
INTIMATE WITH 
ONE 
TABLE TO 
BE 
SO CLOSE 
TO THE 
PLAYERS TO 
SEE 
THEM SIZING THINGS UP IT IS 
REMARKABLE 
SADLY ARE YOU ENJOY REMARKABLE AND THE CRUCIBLE 
YES IT IS 
FANTASTIC 
YOU PLAY SNOOKER QUITE A FANTASTIC LOT YES 
HIGHEST BREAK WELL LOT YES WELL SAY ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
FUTURE NEWS READER OR 
FUTURE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
IF HE 
GETS INTO NEWS READING SOMETHING 
IS VERY WRONG 
THE DRAMA IS HERE 
TODAY THEY ARE MAKING THE NEWS 
ABSOLUTELY WE ARE PART OF A BIG 
EVENT AND REALLY ENJOYING IT WE 
ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO SOME 
BRILLIANT SNOOKER TODAY 
NICE TO 
MEET YOU 
THE PLAYERS ARE ABOUT TO RETURN TO 
THE CRUCIBLE ARENA THE CROWD WILL 
GIVE THEM A BIG 
ROUND OF 
APPLAUSE 
ALI CARTER 
HAS GOT AN AWFUL LOT TO 
DO RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IN CONTROL OF 
THIS FINAL HERE THEY ARE THERE IS 
A CHANGE IN THE COMMENTARY BOX IT 
IS CLIVE EVERTON AND DENNIS TAYLOR 
THANK YOU RAY GOOD AFTERNOON 
EVERYONE IF YOU ARE THINKING OF 
CRUCIBLE RECOVERIES YOU HAVE TO 
THINK OF STEPHEN HENDRY IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
FOURTEEN TO EIGHT DOWN TO JIMMY WHITE HE WON 
EIGHTEEN TO FOURTEEN WITH A RUN OF TEN STRAIGHT 
FRAMES BUT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY 
THAT ALI CARTER IS LOOKING TO TIRED 
MENTALLY FOR ANY HEROICS LIKE THAT 
O'SULLIVAN TENDS TO BREAK OF LEFT 
HANDED BECAUSE HE FEELS THAT HE CAN 
GET MORE SIDE SPIN ALL THE BALL 
LEFT HANDED THAN RIGHT OR ON THE 
BALL 
HE HAS MISHIT THAT COMPLETELY BUT 
I THINK HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT 
THAT WAS JUST A STRAIGHT FORWARD 
SAFETY SHOT HE HAS DONE WELL TO 
LEAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
O'SULLIVAN DIDN'T INTEND THE RED TO 
CANNON INTO THE YELLOW BUT HE HAS 
GOT THE CUE BALL TIGHT ON THE BAULK 
CUSHION 
YES THIS WAS JUST A CUSHION STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN SHOT AND HE 
HIT IT FAR TOO THIN AS I SAY HE 
DID WELL TO GET AWAY WITH IT BUT 
HE NEEDS A RUN OF THE BALL TO GET 
GOING HERE 
RONNIE IS 
NOT 
GOING TO EASE UP THAT'S FOR 
SURE RONNIE 
WILL WANT TO 
GET OVER 
THE WINNING 
LINE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE 
AND ANOTHER MISTAKE I THINK HE 
FEELS NOW THAT HE HAS GOT TO HAVE A 
GO AT ALMOST ANYTHING BUT DON'T 
PUSH THE BOAT OVER TO MUCH IT IS 
NOT OVER YET ALI WAIT UNTIL YOU 
GET A BETTER CHANCE THAN THAT 
WELL CHANCE FOR CARTER 
O'SULLIVAN'S RED JUST FINDING THE 
FAR JAW 
THIS CHAMPIONSHIP IS A MATTER OF 
THE MIND THE PROBLEM FOR CARTER IS 
THAT HE HAS HIT THE WALL HE HASN'T 
GOT THAT EASY AUTOMATIC 
CONCENTRATION THAT HE HAD A FEW 
DAYS AGO 
JUST GET THE YELLOW OUT OF THE WAY 
HERE HE CAN PLAY FOR THE 
RED THAT 
IS 
NEXT TO 
THE BLACK IF HE WANTS 
THIS IS A PRETTY DECENT CHANCE SO 
ALI JUST HOLD HIMSELF TOGETHER 
HE WOULD KNOCK IN A FEW POINTS L. THINK 
THIS CROWD 
WOULD LOVE 
TO SEE 
HIM 
MAKE A 
BIT OF A COMEBACK HERE 
CARTER'S FIRST TARGET IS TO TAKE 
THE MATCH INTO THE EVENING SESSION 
IF HE WON THIS FRAME HE WILL HAVE 
DONE THAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE 
THAT 
KEY SHOT COMING UP HE HAS A COUPLE 
OF LOOSE REDS BUT IT BEGAN JUST 
CANNON THE END OF THAT LITTLE BUNCH 
THE ONE 
ON THE 
LEFT THAT 
WOULD 
REALLY OPEN THINGS UP BUT IF HE 
CAN CANNON 
NOT BAD HE HAS STILL GOT ONE INTO 
THE RIGHT CORNER DIDN'T WANT TO 
HIT THE RED THAT BEEN THOUGH THAT 
IS WHY THE WHITE JUST SLIPPED AWAY 
THAT THIN 
WOULD BE LESS LIKELY 
TO MISS IT IF IT WAS STRAIGHTER 
BUT STILL WELL WITHIN HIS USUAL 
RANGE THAT WAS A BIT OF A TEST OF HIS CUE 
ACTION THERE 
AND 
HE HAS 
COME 
THROUGH IT VERY WELL WHEN YOU ARE 
UNDER PRESSURE THAT TYPE OF SHOT 
IS EASY TO MISS 
YOU COULD SEE ALI JUST CUEING AT 
THE TOP OF THE BALL THERE TO FOLLOW 
THROUGH WITH A BIT OF TOP SPIN 
THEN THAT SHOT WAS PLAYED CENTRE 
BALL TO CREATE THE STUN SHOT 
IT WOULD BE NICE IF CARTER COULD 
WIN THIS FRAME IN A SINGLE SCORING 
VISIT HE HAS NOT BEEN DOING THAT 
IN THIS MATCH 
A SLIGHTLY AWKWARD ANGLE ON THE 
PINK HE PLAYED IT WELL 
GOT TO GO BACK TO FRAME THIRTEEN WHEN ALI 
MADE A BREAK OF EIGHTY TO WIN A FRAME 
IN ONE VISIT 
AND THAT WAS FROM ZERO TO FORTY FIVE THAT WAS 
AFTER O'SULLIVAN HAD BEEN THROWN 
OUT OF POSITION BY KICK 
AT THE MOMENT CLIVE ALI IS 
PLAYING FOR HIS PRIDE HE HAS PUT 
UP SUCH A PERFORMANCE SO FAR IN 
THIS YEAR'S EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD SNOOKER 
CHAMPIONSHIP THIS WILL GIVE HIM A 
BOOST THAT HE BADLY NEEDED 
HE HAS 
TAKEN THE MATCH INTO THE EVENING 
SESSION AND NOW HE WANTS TO TAKE 
IT INTO A REASONABLY PROLONGED 
EVENING SESSION HAS BEEN AN ALL 
ROUND BREAK BECAUSE HE HAS POTTED 
EVERY COLOUR ON THE TABLE DURING 
THIS BREAK 
PITY HE FINISHED DEAD STRAIGHT ON 
THAT RED BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET 
OUT FROM IT TO TAKE BACK TO CORNER 
BLACK TO CORNER 
VERY NICE EIGHTY FOUR BREAK THEN FROM ALI 
CARTER HE GETS ANOTHER FRAME ON 
THE BOARD BUT O'SULLIVAN STILL HAS 
A COMMANDING LEAD OF FOURTEEN TO SEVEN 
AND WE HAVE AN EVENING SESSION GET 
OUT YOUR BOW TIES I'M SURE THAT 
WILL BE A BIT OF A FILLIP TO HIS 
CONFIDENCE 
I A REALLY GOOD EFFORT CONFIDENCE THAT WAS WE KNOW HOW HE IS FEELING 
AND HOW MENTALLY TOUGH IT HAS BEEN 
FOR THE LAST COUPLE 
OF WEEKS 
THEN 
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT VERY 
GOOD INDEED WELL DONE 
YOU ECHO 
THE SENTIMENTS STEVE 
YES OTHER 
THAN TO SAY THAT THE PERSON GETS TO 
THE FINAL IS PLAYING AND CUEING 
VERY WELL AT SOME STAGE HE WOULD 
HOPE TO DO THAT AS WELL THE CROWD 
ARE WILLING HIM TO GET BACK HE 
HIMSELF THINKS THAT IS WHAT HE 
SHOULD BE DOING AND 
HE WILL 
BE 
FRUSTRATED HE 
HAS 
NOT BEEN 
DOING IT 
A BIT MORE 
HE HAS REACHED THE 
HEIGHTS I GET INTO THIS CRUCIBLE 
FINAL BUT HE IS A PRETTY AMBITIOUS 
FELLOW 
AND NOT 
JUST IN A SNOOKER 
CAREER OVER 
THE PAST COUPLE OF 
YEARS HE HAS 
BEEN TRAINING 
TO END 
HIS PILOT'S 
LICENCE 
WITH A 
VIEW TO 
BECOMING A COMMERCIAL PILOT WHEN HE 
FINALLY PUTS AWAY HIS CUE HENCE 
HIS NICKNAME THE CAPTAIN CARTER HE 
WILL BE HOPING THAT BY WINNING THAT 
LAST FRAME HE WILL BE CLEARED FOR 
TAKE OFF IN THIS FINAL 
HE LANDED IN THE SEMI FINALS O. K. 
BUT NOT ENOUGH FUEL IN THE TANK IT 
SEEMS TO GO ON TO MAKE REALLY 
STRONG CHALLENGE IN THE FINAL BUT 
HE IS PLAYING IT FRAME BY FRAME 
THAT IS ALL HE CAN DO 
THAT'S NOT ALL THAT BAD HE HASN'T 
LEFT ANYTHING EASY HERE FOR ALI 
CARTER WHO I DON'T THINK WILL BE 
FLYING FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW THAT 
HE IS SITTING AT WELL HE IS 
NUMBER SEVEN IN THE WORLD SO HE IS 
GOING TO BE AROUND THE SNOOKER 
CIRCUIT FOR QUITE WHILE THE OLD FLYING MIGHT 
HAVE TO 
TAKE A BACK 
SEAT FOR A WHILE 
HE HAS ALSO GOT 
ANOTHER BUSINESS HE IS THE OWNER 
OF CHELMSFORD SNOOKER CLUB NOT 
SURPRISINGLY HE PRACTISES THERE 
AND STRAIGHT AWAY A CHANCE TO 
DEVELOP THE BLACK JUST A LITTLE 
CANNON HERE HE'S ALWAYS LOOKING 
FOR THAT SHOT IS A RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN 
THAT'S RONNIE'S PARTNER JO WITH 
YOUNG RONNIE THAT IS NEARLY 
THAT IS LEE LILY 
IT IS HIS TURN LILY WALKED AROUND 
THE TABLE IN THE U. K. 
O'SULLIVAN NEVER MEANT TO BE ON 
THAT RED HE MEANT TO BE ON ONE OF 
THE TWO BACK REDS BUT HE HAD THAT 
AS AN ALTERNATIVE AND HAS LEFT 
HIMSELF DEAD STRAIGHT 
HE COULD DO WITH THE CANNON OF THE 
TWO REDS HE COULD DO WITHOUT THE 
CANNON ON THE TWO REDS THOSE TWO 
REDS ARE AWAITING 
HE REALLY IS A BIT SPECIAL TO WATCH 
WHEN HE IS AROUND THE BLACK SPOT 
AND BREAK BUILDING 
UNDER HITTING THAT PURPOSELY SO 
THAT HE WOULD LEAVE AN ANGLE TO POT 
THIS AND TRY AND DEVELOP A FEW MORE 
THAT GOT KICK 
IT SOUNDED LIKE HE KICK THE RED 
JUST JUMPED A LITTLE BIT BUT HE 
DIDN'T QUITE GET ENOUGH TOP SPIN ON 
IT EITHER NOW HE HAS GOT TO GET TO 
THE BLACK DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE 
CAN STRETCH ROUND AND PLAY AN 
UNUSUAL TYPE SHOT HERE A BIT OF A 
STRETCH THAT HE IS GOING TO NEED 
A LOT OF HELP IF HE IS 
GOING TO 
GET 
THE LONG TACKLE OUT HE IS JUST 
GUESSING HERE BECAUSE HE CAN'T SEE 
WHAT HE IS DOING 
O'SULLIVAN IRRITATED CARTER 
RELIEVED 
HUW EDWARDS USED TO READING THE 
NEWS BUT O'SULLIVAN IS THE MAN 
MAKING IT 
THAT'S THE ARTIST DAMIEN HIRST HE 
LIKENED O'SULLIVAN IN SOME RESPECTS 
TO PICASSO 
WHAT WAS HIS HIGHEST BREAK CLIVE 
PICASSO L. L. DIDN'T KNOW HE PLAYED THE GAME SPANISH CHAMPION 
AND LEE WANTED TO OPEN THE REDS 
THERE BUT IT IS LITTLE AWKWARD ALI WANTED 
ONCE AGAIN RONNIE KEEPING FOCUSED 
THINKING ABOUT THE SHOT HERE SO HE 
IS NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY CAREFUL 
MISTAKES THAT'S FOR SURE 
CARELESS MISTAKES THE AUDIENCE IS 
PACKED HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE 
THEY ARE LOVING EVERY MINUTE OF 
THIS A LOT OF RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
SUPPORTERS BUT LOT OF THEM WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE ALI CARTER MAKING A 
COMEBACK THAT'S TERRIFIC SUCCESS 
RATE FOR THE TOURNAMENT NINETY THREE PER CENT ALI 
CARTER IS DOING WELL AT NINETY PER CENT THAT 
IS FOR THE WHOLE OF THE TOURNAMENT 
BEFORE THE MATCH HE SITTING AND NINETY FOUR 
PER CENT ALI AT EIGHTY EIGHT HE IS SITTING AT NINETY FOUR 
PER CENT 
WHAT DID O'SULLIVAN POINT OUT 
THERE SO IS SOMETHING PUTTING 
HIM OFF HE SAID SOMETHING TO JAN 
VERHAAS JAN VERHAAS HAS NOT TAKING 
ANY ACTION HAS 
NOT TAKEN THAT'S THAT'S NOT A GOOD SHOT FROM ALI HE HAS 
UNDERHIT THAT BY A LONG WAY L. 
THINK IT COULD POSSIBLY BE THE 
PRESS BOX WE HAVE A PHOTOGRAPHER'S 
BOX BUT THE PHOTOGRAPHERS ARE 
INSIDE THE BOX ANYWAY BACK TO 
NORMAL HERE 
IT'S JUST YOU CAN HEAR A PIN DROP 
AT THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE WHEN YOU 
ARE OUT THERE PLAYING 
THIS IS THE 
SORT OF PLACE WHERE NOBODY DARES TO 
UNWRAP A SWEET 
IT HAS HAPPENED IN 
THE PAST 
TALKING ABOUT THAT I REMEMBER A 
REFEREE WHEN SOMEONE WAS RATTLING A 
SWEETIE BAG AND HE SAID SIR CAN 
HE KEEP THAT BAD QUITE QUESTION UP 
CAN YOU KEEP THAT BAG QUIET L. AM 
NOT SURE THAT IS WHAT HE MEANT BUT 
WE ALL UNDERSTOOD 
THE LADY BESIDE 
THE GENTLEMAN WASN'T OFFENDED 
THE TWO REDS THE LEFT SIDE OF THE 
TABLE ARE CAUSING THE PROBLEM WITH 
THE SAFETY RETURN HERE THERE IS A 
POSSIBLE SHOT TO NOTHING BUT HE 
WOULD CANNON INTO THOSE 
THAT IS TOO TIGHT THE OTHER THE 
ONE THE OTHER SIDE IS VERY AWKWARD 
BUT NO EASY SAFETY SHOT HE MAY 
HAVE TO TAKE THE POT ON HERE 
LONG WAY OUT IF YOU GOT THAT RED 
IN THE JAW THE CUE BALL WOULD HAVE 
RETURNED TOWARDS BAULK IF HE HAD 
GOT THAT RED IN THE JAW 
WHAT A 
RESULT HE HAS HAD THERE THOUGH TO 
GET IT PERFECTLY SAFE 
TWICE ACROSS THE TABLE TO GET NEAR 
THE BROWN 
THAT SAFETY HAS BROUGHT THE BLACK 
INTO SOMEWHAT BETTER POSITIONED 
NEARER THE POCKET BETTER 
POSITION O'SULLIVAN LONG WAY IN 
FRONT BUT HE IS TAKING NOTHING FOR 
GRANTED 
ALI MIGHT BE TEMPTED HERE TO HAVE A 
GO AT THE RED INTO THE RIGHT CORNER 
BECAUSE A 
NATURAL ANGLE 
WILL TAKE 
HIM OVER TOWARDS THE BLACK HE WILL 
GET A BIT OF A ROUND OF APPLAUSE HE PULLS THIS ONE OFF 
EXCELLENT POT AUTOMATIC POSITION 
ON BLACK 
IF THE MIDDLE ONE GOES THAT'S MUCH 
BETTER HE CAN JUST RUN THROUGH FOR 
THE BLACK NOW CAN HE HOLD HIMSELF 
TOGETHER AGAIN AND NOT IN A 
SIZEABLE CONTRIBUTION HERE HE DID 
IT IN THE LAST FRAME AND NOT IN 
A SIZEABLE CONTRIBUTION AND IN KNOCK IN 
IT CAME OFF THIS CUSHION A LOT 
FASTER THAN IT WENT ON 
IT MUST NOT BE A GOOD ANGLE YOU 
WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE A 
STRAIGHTFORWARD SHOT TO ROLL THE 
RED AND GOLD ON THE BLACK GO ON 
THE BLACK 
IF HE RUNS THROUGH THERE HE MIGHT 
JUST HIT THE RED NEAREST THE BLACK 
IT IS AMAZING HOW SOMETIMES WHEN 
YOU'RE STRUGGLING JUST A FRACTION 
MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE HE IS NOW 
TAKING THE MORE DIFFICULT ONE TO 
OPEN THE REDS AND PINK UP I THINK HE IS O. K. WITH THE BLACK 
THE RED IS A BIT OF A DISTRACTION 
WHERE IT HAS FINISHED BUT I THINK 
HE CAN CUE O. K. HE WILL 
AUTOMATICALLY DROP ON A CHOICE OF 
TWO REDS JUST A LITTLE BIT AWKWARD 
AWKWARD ENOUGH TO MISS IT IS THE 
PLANT ON HE HAS HIT IT TOO HARD 
ANYWAY 
THAT IS WHERE HE WAS TRYING TO GET 
THE WHITE HE JUST OVER HIT IT 
A BALL THAT O'SULLIVAN WOULD 
NORMALLY POT 
WE TEND TO TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED 
THE WAY RONNIE HAS BEEN PLAYING HE 
HAS GOT TO KEEP FULLY FOCUSED HE 
CANNOT LET ANYTHING SLIP IN THIS 
GAME BECAUSE IT CAN CHANGE AROUND 
AS THE RED WAS RUNNING ALONG THE 
CUSHION CARTER WAS THINKING HE HAD 
LEFT THIS BUT HE HAS NOT 
JUST REBOUNDED IN OFF IN OFF 
IT JUST REBOUNDED IN OFF 
HE CAN SEE ENOUGH OF THIS RED TO 
TAKE THE POT ON BUT HE SEEMS 
RELUCTANT 
HE IS KEEPING IT TIGHT ALI IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT FOR OR 
ANYTHING HE GETS 
O'SULLIVAN COVERING THE IMPORTANT 
RED 
ALI IS LOOKING AT THE RED TO THE 
MIDDLE POCKET A TOUGH SHOT 
THERE IS A LONG RED IT WILL GO INTO 
THE CORNER YOU DO NOT WANT BE 
TAKING THOSE ON 
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER HAVING A 
GO AT IT HE HAS PLAYED A POOR 
SAFETY SHOT 
THE SAFETY WOULD NOT 
HAVE BEEN DUE BACK IF HE COULD HAVE 
AVOIDED THE MIDDLE POCKET JOLT 
JAW 
THAT IS JUST INCREDIBLE LEFT HANDED 
THE BLACK WAS HAMPERING HIM 
SLIGHTLY HE IS BRIDGING OVER THE 
BLACK AND HE PUT IT RIGHT IN THE 
CENTRE OF THE POCKET SCREWS BACK 
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF REVERSE SIDE 
I DO NOT THINK PEOPLE REALISE HOW 
DIFFICULT THAT IS TO DO WITH THE 
OPPOSITE HAND L. USED TO PLAY SOME 
SHOTS WITH THE LEFT HAND BUT THAT 
TYPE OF SHOT I COULD NEVER GET 
ANYWHERE NEAR 
NOT QUITE THE DESIRED KISS ON THE 
PINK L. THOUGHT HE MIGHT LEAVE IT 
STRAIGHT INTERESTING THING ABOUT 
O'SULLIVAN AND LEFT HANDEDNESS 
WHEN HE USES A KNIFE AND FORK HE 
HOLDS HIS KNIFE IN HIS LEFT HAND 
HE IS CERTAINLY NOT RUSHING THINGS 
HE IS GIVING EVERY SHOT IS FULL 
CONCENTRATION 
LEADING BY TWENTY NINE POINTS IF O'SULLIVAN 
TIES UP THE GREEN O'SULLIVAN TIES 
UP THE GREEN TO MAKE A CARTER 
CLEARANCE LESS LIKELY 
THERE IS NOT ONE COLOUR ON ITS SPOT 
WHICH IS QUITE UNUSUAL 
CARTER HAS WON TWO OF THE LAST 
THREE FRAMES BUT HE HAS STILL GOT 
A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE HE GETS 
BACK INTO CONTENTION 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE WAS HE 
ATTEMPTED THAT RED HE WAS FULLY 
COMMITTED ONCE HE ATTEMPTED THAT 
RED HE WAS FULLY COMMITTED THE ONE 
NEAR THE LEFT CORNER IS NOT AN EASY 
POT THAT IS WHY NEITHER PLAYER IS 
LOOKING AT IT 
IF YOU'RE IN BEHIND IT IT IS AN 
EASY SHOT BUT NOT FROM DISTANCE 
IS THAT AT TEMPTER HE HAS LEFT ALI 
KHIDER IS THAT A TEMPTER HE HAS 
LEFT ALI 
EXCELLENT SHOT PARTICULARLY FROM 
SOMEONE WHO HAS MISSED JUST OVER 
HALF HIS LONG POTS 
THERE ARE A LOT OF KEY BALLS HERE 
THE RED NEAR THE OTHER CORNER 
POCKET FOR ONE YOU HAVE GOT TO 
GET CLOSE TO IT AM NOT SURE 
ABOUT THAT ONE THOUGHT HE WOULD 
HAVE PLAYED FOR THE PINK AND THEN 
HE COULD HAVE PLAYED UP ON TO THAT 
RED 
IT IS THE END OF BREAK ALL HE CAN 
PLAY NOW IS SNOOKER 
HE MAY HAVE GOT THE SNOOKER BUT IT 
IS JUST STRAIGHTFORWARD ESCAPE 
FOUL AND A MISS ALI 
CARTER FOUR 
HE IS MISS HE DIDN'T THEM AT THE 
MOMENT HE WILL BE LUCKY IF HE GETS 
AWAY WITH THIS HE IS NOT HITTING 
THEM ACCURATELY AT THE MOMENT A 
POOR SAFETY SHOT FROM RONNIE THERE A GOOD ANGLE AUTOMATICALLY COME UP 
TO THE GREEN 
AUTOMATICALLY COME UP TO THE GREEN HERE A TRICKY LITTLE POT 
THIS LOOKS TO BE O. K. HE HAS GOT AN 
ANGLE HERE HE COULD POSSIBLY 
DEVELOP THE BROWN IF HE CATCHES 
THIS ONE PROPERLY HE CAN GO TWICE 
ACROSS THE TABLE OR DIRECTLY INTO 
THE BLACK IF HE DOES NOT GET THE 
SNOOKER IF HE DOES NOT GET THE 
SPLIT RATHER HE COULD THEN GET THE 
SNOOKER 
NOT AT THE VERY BEST ANGLE IT 
NEEDED TO BE TO THE RIGHT OF THE 
BLACK 
IT WAS A BIGGER TARGET HAD BLACK HE COME OFF TWO CUSHIONS 
IF HE CAN AND 
GET A GOOD CUE BALL THAT 
BE QUITE 
A GOOD RESULT FOR HIM VERY GOOD SHOT 
THAT HAS CREATED A SITUATION 
WHEREBY WHOEVER POT THE BROWN 
SHOULD WIN THE FRAME POTS 
HE HAS GOT THE SNOOKER IT WAS A 
SHOT TO NOTHING 
IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW MANY TIMES 
YOU ARE FACED WITH THIS SITUATION 
YOU HAVE TO TRY TO GET OUT OF THE 
SNOOKER AND HOPE THAT YOU CAN KNOCK 
THE BROWN SAFE HE SWERVED THAT 
BUT I THINK HE MAY HAVE LEFT IT IT 
IS NOT BAD HE MADE IT LOOK EASY 
SO NO PRESSURE ON THIS PINK 
CARTER ALREADY NEEDS SNOOKER FOURTEEN AND FRAME 
O'SULLIVAN'S NOT SAID ANY HOPE OF A 
CARTER REVIVAL SNUFFS OUT 
RONNIE NEEDS THREE MORE FRAMES TO 
CLINCH THE TITLE AT WHAT POINT BE 
BEGIN TO SMELL THE TITLE COMING 
AWAY CUE MATT ACTUALLY YOU 
PUSHING THE BOAT OUT BECAUSE IT 
WILL LEAD THE OTHER GUY DID THE 
DAMAGE HIMSELF 
WE TALKED EARLIER ON THE QUESTION 
WAS ASKED OF TERRY GRIFFITHS WHEN 
HE WAS EIGHT TO ONE IN FRONT AGAINST REC 
AGAINST REX WILLIAMS HE LOST EIGHT ON 
THIS WHEN SPAIN EIGHT IN A ROW 
TERRY KEPT GOING FOR A GAME SHOT 
ALL THE TIME AND EVENTUALLY REX GOT 
BACK IN THE GAME RONNIE JUST NEEDS 
TO PLAY A CONTAINING GAME 
DO YOU RELAX DO YOU FEEL YOU ARE 
THERE T. GET A SURGE OF ENERGY 
IT IS THE SAME OLD THING WE HAVE 
TWO FRAMES LEFT IN THIS SESSION AT 
THE MOMENT RONNIE WILL BE HOPING 
TO WIN BOTH TO COME OUT TONIGHT IN 
GIVE HIMSELF THE LEAST TO DO HE 
COMES INTO THE LAST SESSION ON EASY 
STREET ON EASY STREET ALI ALI CARTER HAS BEEN PRETTY FATIGUE HE 
HAS THAT TO PLAY THAT SEMI FINAL 
HAS BEEN PRETTY TIRED RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN MUST BE FEELING THE 
EFFECTS OF A LONG FOUGHT BACK 
YES YOU'RE PLAYING EVERY DAY FOR 
THE SECOND WEEK OF THE TOURNAMENT 
IT TAKES ITS TOLL 
GOING BACK TO 
THE SEMI FINAL WITH HENDRY THAT 
WAS A PEAK PERFORMANCE VERY 
DIFFICULT TO BUILD ANOTHER ONE 
STRAIGHT AFTER THAT 
BUT WE HAVE MENTIONED THROUGHOUT 
THE SEVENTEEN DAYS HOW RONNIE HAS BEEN 
RUNNING EVERY DAY HE REALLY IS FIT 
SOMEONE WHO EARLIER IN THE 
TOURNAMENT SAID HE LOOKS BIT REAL 
HILL HE LOOKS SAID HE LOOKS A 
LITTLE BIT ILL HE LOOKS FANTASTIC 
TWENTY SIXTH IN THE ESSEX CROSS COUNTRY 
CHAMPIONSHIP THAT IS A PRETTY 
DECENT STANDARD 
I THINK IT IS GOOD FOR GREAT 
PLAYERS IN THEIR SPORT TO BE ABLE 
TO PLAY ANOTHER ONE TO GOOD 
STANDARD IN AN AMATEUR SPIRIT 
O'SULLIVAN ENJOYS THE ENVIRONMENT 
OF RUNNING NOT JUST A RUNNING 
ITSELF THE RUNNING ITSELF 
MISCALCULATION BUT I THINK HE HAS 
GOT AWAY WITH IT I THINK HE HAS 
LEFT IT PERFECTLY SAFE A LITTLE 
BIT FORTUNATE IT IS USUALLY THE 
CASE WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING WELL YOU 
GET THE RUN OF THE BALL WHEN 
YOU'RE STRUGGLING EVERYTHING 
DEPENDS TO RUN AWKWARDLY FOR YOU 
EVERYTHING HAS A TENDENCY TO RUN 
AWKWARDLY FOR YOU THAT IS MARIA RONNIE'S MOTHER 
WE HAVE A PLAYER'S ROOM HERE IT IS 
USUALLY PACKED ON FINALS DAY PLAYERS' 
THAT IS THE SORT OF SAFETY HE WAS 
PLAYING AGAINST STEPHEN HENDRY 
AGAINST STEPHEN HENDRY WHEN HE PUT 
HIM IN TROUBLE RONNIE GOT A WHITE 
EXACTLY WHERE HE WANTED IT THAT 
DID NOT LEAVE THE SAFETY SHOT ON 
ALI IS HAVING TO THINK ABOUT THIS 
TO FIND THE GAP TO GET BACK DOWN 
THE TABLE HE HAS GOT A LITTLE GAP 
TO FIND HERE AND HE WILL DO WELL TO 
FIND IT JUST BETWEEN THE BLACK AND 
THE THREE REDS THAT IS ONE WAY OF 
GETTING BACK DOWN THE TABLE MAYBE 
HE DESERVES BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE 
REMARKABLE THAT HE GOT THE CUE BALL 
AS FAR AWAY AS THAT 
THERE IS A POT TO THE RIGHT CORNER 
ONCE AGAIN HE WOULD HAVE TO FIND A 
GAP 
HE IS ON A COLOUR WITH THE HELP OF 
ANOTHER RED 
IF YOU GET THE POT YOU'RE ALWAYS 
GIVING YOURSELF ACCOUNT CHANCE 
A BIT SHORT OF PACE IT IS GOING TO 
BE A LONG STRAIGHT BLUE 
IT GETS TO A POINT IN A MATCH WHERE 
YOU WERE SO FAR BEHIND YOU TEND TO 
RELAX AND LET YOUR CUE ACTION FLO 
AND HAVE A GO ADDED I'M JUST 
WONDERING IF THAT IS GOING TO BE 
THE CASE FLO 
HE HAS GOT NOTHING TO LOSE ON LAST 
REMARKABLY HE WOULD GIVE HIMSELF A 
CHANCE OF WINNING UNLESS 
REMARKABLY HE WERE TO GIVE HIMSELF 
A CHANCE OF WINNING REALISTICALLY 
HE KNOWLES THERE IS ONLY THE 
SMALLEST OF CHANCES OF PULLING THIS 
MATCH AROUND REALISTICALLY HE IS 
AWARE REALISTICALLY HE KNOWS 
HE CAN Y. TO PUT IT BETTER 
COMPLEXION ON THE SCORE HE 
BETTER COMPLEXION HE CAN TRY TO 
PUT A BETTER COMPLEXION ON THE 
SCORE 
HE DECIDED TO DEVELOP A FEW THERE 
AND HE ADMITTED THAT HE HAS PUT 
HIMSELF COMPLETELY OUT OF POSITION 
HE DID NOT HIT THAT PROPERLY HE 
HAS LET THAT CHANCE SLIP AWAY THIS 
WOULD BE A GOOD SHOT HE IS LOOKING 
AT PLAYING LITTLE CANNON IN OFF A 
RED ONTO THE BLACK WHAT SHOT 
THAT WOULD BE IT IS A LITTLE THIN 
SNICK OFF THAT RED HIT THE BLACK 
AND TRIED TO POT THE RED TRY 
THE SNAG WAS THAT HE COULD NOT GOOD 
POSITION FROM THAT ANGLE GET 
POSITION FROM THAT ANGLE ALI CARTER EIGHTEEN 
HE IS STILL THINKING POSITIVE THAT 
SHOT WAS PURELY PLAY TO BRING THE 
BLACK INTO PLAY PLAYED 
HE HAS GOT A BIT OF A CHANCE NOT 
EASY TO CONTROL THE CUE BALL HE 
CAN AVOID THE CANON ONTO THE RED 
HE HAS STILL GOT TO FIND A GAP IT 
IS AWKWARD WITH THE BROWN HE IS 
LOOKING AT THE MORE DIFFICULT ONE 
INTO THE LEFT CORNER 
HE HAS GOT TO GET IT IF HE TAKES 
THAT ONE ON 
A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THAT HE KNEW 
IF HE MISSED IT HE WOULD PUT RONNIE 
IN AMONGST THE BALLS THAT COULD 
COST HIM THIS FRAME ALL THE BALLS 
ARE NICELY SITUATED THAT WAS A BIG 
SHOT FROM ALI 
WHEN O'SULLIVAN COMES TO THE TABLE 
IN A POSITION LIKE THIS MY FIRST 
THOUGHT IS HE CAN WIN THE FRAME AT 
THIS VISIT IT CERTAINLY DID NOT 
INCLUDE EVEN THE 
SUSPICION 
THAT HE COULD EVER MISS A PINK LIKE 
THAT 
THE WHITE IS BEING CLEANED THAT BUT I THINK THAT WAS A LAPSE IN 
CONCENTRATION MAYBE HE DID GET 
HEAVY CONTACT BUT I THINK HE JUST 
LOST A LITTLE BIT OF FOCUS 
IT IS A STRANGE GAME AT TIMES ALI 
PUT EVERYTHING INTO A LONG POT AND 
NOW HE IS BACK AT THE TABLE AFTER 
RONNIE MISSED A COMPLETE SITTER IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN THE CONTACT BUT IT 
DID NOT SEEM TO BE 
USUALLY YOU SEE THE PINK LIFT IT 
DID NOT LIFT THAT TIME 
WHEN CARTER LOST FIVE FRAMES IN 
SUCCESSION TO GO FROM EIGHT TO FIVE DOWN TO 
THIRTEEN TO FIVE DOWN IT LOOKED AS IF THIS 
MATCH WAS GOING TO TURN INTO A 
PROCESSION BUT HE HAS WON TWO OF 
THE LAST FOUR FRAMES 
AND HE IS HANDILY PLACED TO MAKE IT 
THREE OUT OF FIVE 
HE MIGHT HAVE NEEDED A LITTLE 
CANNON TO OPEN THINGS HE PLAYED IT 
WELL 
BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE FINISHED ON 
THE PINK HE HAD TO JUDGE THAT 
CANNON TO PERFECTION AND HE DID 
SO IT IS OING TO BE THREE FRAMES OUT OF FIVE FOR CARTER 
ALTHOUGH UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM 
HIS OPPONENT IS STILL WITHIN THREE 
FRAMES OF THE WINNING POST 
EVEN TAKING THIS FRAME INTO ACCOUNT 
HE WILL HAVE SEVEN FRAME LEAD 
WELL PLAYED ALI GOOD POSITIONAL 
SHOT NICE TO SEE HIM TAKING THAT 
ON 
HE HAS PUT TOGETHER A COUPLE OF 
DECENT BREAKS EIGHTY FOUR IN THE LAST FRAME 
BUT ONE 
AND NOW THIS FRAME WINNING EFFORTS 
EFFORT FOUL CARTER'S SEVENTY ONE TAKES THE FRAME 
WE DID NOT THINK THAT HE WOULD GET 
THE CHANCE TO MAKE THAT BREAK 
BECAUSE O'SULLIVAN HAD THE FIRST 
CHANCE 
WHO WOULD EVER HAVE THOUGHT THAT 
O'SULLIVAN WOULD MISS THAT YES YES THAT WAS A SITTER BUT THERE WAS A 
LOVELY LITTLE SHOT THAT ALI PLAYED 
IN THAT BREAK L. HAVE PUT THE OTHER 
WHITE UP HE WAS TRYING TO GET THE 
WHITE WHERE I HAVE THE OTHER WHITE 
BECAUSE HE FINISHED WHERE HE DID 
HE PLAYED A DELICATE LITTLE CANNON 
HE HAD TO GET THE MIDDLE MACRO 
MIDDLE RED AND HE HIT IT ABSOLUTELY 
PERFECT THAT WAS THE KEY TO THE 
FRAME FRAME A MISTAKE FROM RONNIE AND AS WE 
WERE SAYING BEFORE THAT FRAME BOTH 
MEN ARE JADED WOULDN'T WE PUT THAT 
MISTAKE DOWN TO TIREDNESS YES YES CONCENTRATION LEVELS FROM RONNIE ON 
THE WANE AT THE MOMENT IT IS A 
TOUGH SEVENTEEN DAYS HERE IT DOES NOT 
MATTER IF YOU ARE WINNING EASILY 
IT IS HARD TO WIN THIS TOURNAMENT 
HE IS LOOKING A LITTLE BIT UNDER 
THE WEATHER CONCENTRATION WISE 
THE NERVOUS TENSION THAT IS OUT 
THERE ON DAILY BASIS TAKES ITS 
TOLL MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED IT 
WHEN I WENT THE DISTANCE IN THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP FROM WHAT I 
REMEMBER I LOST HALF A STONE IN 
WEIGHT THROUGHOUT THE TOURNAMENT 
POSSIBLY YOU ARE NOT EATING AS WELL 
TOWARDS THE END BECAUSE YOU DON'T 
HAVE THE TIME YOU ARE BURNING IT 
OFF IN MANY WAYS RONNIE IS FIT HE 
IS AN ATHLETE HE RUNS VERY FAST 
HALF MARATHONS THERE IS NOT A LOT 
OF MEAT ON HIM PERHAPS HIS BODY IS 
STRUGGLING LITTLE BIT EVEN SO 
IT IS STILL MARVELLOUS PERFORMANCE 
YOU TALK ABOUT BEING PERFORMANCE ABLE TO REMEMBER HOW MUCH OF YOUR 
FINALS DO YOU RECALL 
YOU ONLY HAVE 
TO SEE THE SCORES IN MASTERMIND TO 
SEE THAT DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY 
YOU GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF 
PLAYING THROUGH THE SESSIONS YOU 
CAN KEEP GOING TO THE WELL AND IF 
YOU ARE IN FRONT IT IS EASY I I REMEMBER IT MORE AFTER IT FINISHED 
I REMEMBER GOING ON HOLIDAY AND NOT 
BEING ABLE TO COME DOWN FROM THE 
ADRENALIN RUSH 
THIS IS THE LAST 
FRAME OF THIS AFTERNOON'S SESSION 
AFTER THIS IT WILL BE TEA BREAK 
TIME NO MATTER WHAT THEY EAT 
WE MUST ALL COMMEND CARTER FOR THE 
WAY HE HAS KEPT GOING AGAINST 
INSURMOUNTABLE ODDS IN THE LAST FEW 
FRAMES OF THIS SESSION 
THIS SHOWS YOU THERE IS NO WAY BACK 
DOWN THE TABLE 
HE HAS NOT TAKE MANY RISKS RONNIE 
I AM WONDERING WHETHER HE WILL HAVE 
A GO HERE BECAUSE THERE IS NO EASY 
SAFETY SHOT 
THAT IS SOME POT AND THAT IS SOME 
POSITIONAL SHOT HE HAS BEEN 
PLAYING THE PERCENTAGES CLIVE BUT 
HE WAS IN QUITE A BIT OF TROUBLE 
THERE WAS NO USE SAFETY SHOT 
AVAILABLE AND LOOK AT THE SHOT HE 
PLAYED 
IN THE LAST FRAME HE PLAYED MISSED THE EASIEST OF PINKS AT THE 
START OF THIS HE POTTED A GOOD 
LONG RED BUT FAILED WITH THE 
SLIGHTLY TRICKY CUT BACK ON THE 
BLACK 
HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A GO AT THAT 
ONE AGAIN L. AM SURPRISED HE DID 
NOT PLAY IT PLAYING BALL IT LOOKED 
A NATURAL ANGLE TO GET BACK INTO 
THE REDS PLAYING BALL 
HE JUST COMING UP TO SIX HOURS' 
PLAY FOR THE MATCH TWENTY THREE COMPLETED 
FRAMES 
AND A LITTLE TRICK SHOT OFF FRAMES THE SIDE CUSHION 
A LITTLE SMILE FROM ALI HE FELT IT 
WAS WORTH THE RISK THE BLACK WAS 
NOT RIGHT OVER THE POCKET HE GOT 
THE DOUBLE KISS A BIT UNLUCKY REALLY 
O'SULLIVAN WILL WANT TO WIN THIS 
FRAME IT WOULD LEAVE HIM NEEDING 
ONLY TWO OF THE EVENING'S SCHEDULED 
ELEVEN HE WOULD BECOME WORLD CHAMPION 
FOR THE THIRD TIME 
THERE IS LITTLE ROOM NOT 
INTERESTED IN THE SNOOKER MUCH 
RONNIE 
RONNIE AND LILY HAVE GIVEN A 
WELCOME NEW DIMENSION TO THIS GREAT 
SNOOKER PLAYER'S LIFE HE DOES LOVE 
HIS HOME LIFE 
TRICKY RED ALONG THE CUSHION TO 
KEEP THE BREAK GOING 
HE HAS OVER DONE IT THAT IS 
ANOTHER LAPSE IN CONCENTRATION FROM 
RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HAS MR. TWO OF RONNIE THOSE IN THIS SESSION IN THE WHOLE 
CHAMPIONSHIP I CANNOT REMEMBER HIM 
MISSING EVEN ONE PLAYED AT THAT 
PACE MR. TWO OF THOSE 
HE HAS TO 
FOCUS A BIT MORE HE HAS LOST SOME 
CONCENTRATION 
HE HAS MISSED TWO CONCENTRATION OF THOSE 
HE NEEDS A GOOD CANNON HERE IS HE O. K. HE MIGHT JUST BE O. K. YES JUST 
ABOUT HE DID NOT QUITE GET THE 
CANNON AS HE INTENDED BUT TRIED TO 
GET THE TWO REDS TOGETHER AND HE 
JUST CAUGHT THE OTHER ONE BUT HE 
IS FINE 
IF CARTER WINS THIS FRAME HE 
SPLITS THE SESSION FOUR TO FOUR WHICH WOULD 
BE A GOOD EFFORT CONSIDERING HIS 
EARLY STRUGGLES THIS AFTERNOON HE 
DROPPED THE FIRST TWO FRAMES 
HE DID NOT CUE THAT VERY WELL HE 
HAS NOT LEFT ANYTHING EASY BUT 
THAT WAS SITTER HE CUED ACROSS THAT ONE NOW HE MISSED ONE OF 
THESE WILL HE NOT GETTING THIS 
TIME KNOCK IT IN HE MIGHT PLAY 
THE CANNON ONTO THE REDS AND PINK 
THAT WOULD REALLY OPEN THINGS UP 
IT OPENS EVERYTHING UP THAT FLEW OFF THE 
SIDE CUSHION SUCH MARGIN FOR ERROR THERE IT SEEMS TO BE THAT AREA OF THE SIDE CUSHION WHERE WE ARE GETTING 
MOST OF THE SPEEDY BOUNCES IT IS 
AS IF THERE IS A HOT SPOT THERE 
THERE WILL BE A CHOICE OF THREE 
REDS FOR HIM HE HAS TWO TO THE 
LEFT OF THE PINK ONE TO THE MIDDLE 
TWENTY FOUR IS THE DIFFERENCE THE TWO EASY 
REDS PLUS COLOURS AND RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN WILL BE JUST TWO FRAMES 
AWAY 
AND ALSO A U. K. AND WORLD DOUBLE 
WHICH HAS ONLY BEEN DONE BY FOUR 
PLAYERS IN THE SAME SEASON STEVE 
DAVIS STEPHEN HENDRY AND MARK 
WILLIAMS 
HE MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO DEVELOP 
THE LAURSEN RED THE LAST RED HE 
HAS NOT BOTHERED IT IS ALL OVER 
THE FRAME 
IT LEAVES CARTER NEEDING TWO 
SNOOKERS IT IS GOING TO BE SIXTEEN TO EIGHT 
GOING INTO THE FINAL SESSION 
THAT IS ONE WAY OF GETTING OUT OF 
THAT SNOOKER 
THAT WAS QUITE 
AMAZING BUT NOW HE WILL PLAY ON 
BECAUSE TWO SNOOKERS FRAMES HAVE 
BEEN ONE FROM THAT THE RED GOES TO 
THE MIDDLE IT IS NOT THERE 
HE ATTEMPTED IT OFF THE SIDE AND 
POSSIBLY BAULK CUSHION HE DID NOT 
EXPECT TO HAVE TO RELY ON THE JAWS 
THAT IS TOO THIN RONNIE HE WAS 
TRYING TO GET IN BEHIND THE BLACK 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
NO POINT IN 
PUTTING THIS RED THOUGH HE NEEDS 
TO BE SURE OF GETTING ON THE BLACK 
SO THAT WAS A DELIBERATE MISS AND AND THIS WILL BE A DELIBERATE AND ALL 
OVER THE CORNER POCKET IN OR OVER 
WILL DO HE HAS PLAYED THE SNOOKER 
WE HAVE BOTH PLAYERS PLAYING FOR 
SNOOKERS NOW 
I THINK HE HAS GOT THE SNOOKER 
BEHIND THE BLUE THE PINK AND BLACK 
ARE NOW IN A VERY GOOD POSITION TO 
PLAY SNOOKERS BEHIND 
SURELY HE CANNOT POT THIS INTO THE 
MIDDLE 
THERE IS A LITTLE SHOT ON HERE HE 
CAN PLAY THE RED OF THE JAW OF THE 
POCKET AND SEND THE WHITE UP 
TOWARDS THE YELLOW THE RED MIGHT 
COME AWAY FROM THE MIDDLE POCKET 
ABOVE ALL MAKE SURE HE KEEPS THE 
RED SAFE THAT IS WHAT COULD HAPPEN HE TRIED IT 
THE BLACK IS IN WHAT WAS THAT 
RONNIE HAS TRIED TO MOVE THE PINK 
AND BLACK BECAUSE THEY ARE IN A 
GOOD POSITION FOR THE SNOOKER HOW 
COSTLY COULD THAT BE THIRTY SIX IS THE 
DIFFERENCE NOW HE JUST WANTED TO 
SPLIT THEM UP SO THAT IT WOULD NOT 
BE EASY TO GET THE SNOOKER BEHIND 
AND AMAZINGLY KNOCKED IN THE 
BLACK 
STILL ONE SNOOKER NEEDED BLACK THOUGH 
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH PUTTING 
THIS RED AS LONG AS HE GETS QUITE 
A HIGH VALUE COLOUR LOOK WHERE THE 
BLACK IS NOW TO GET A SNOOKER 
BEHIND HE NEEDS TO FINISH ON A 
COLOUR THOUGH HE WOULD HAVE LIKED 
TO HAVE LEFT THE BLACK THERE HE 
MIGHT HAVE TO POT IT NOW WOULD 
PREFER TO LEAVE THE BLACK THERE FOR 
SNOOKERING PURPOSES THAT IS WHAT 
HE IS DOING 
THE BLACK IS IN A GOOD POSITION TO 
GET A SNOOKER BEHIND THE BLUE IS 
IN A GOOD POSITION TO GET A SNIGGER 
BEHIND THIS FRAME IS NOT OVER YET 
SNOOKER HE CAN POP THE YELLOW IF 
HE WISHES POT L. THINK HE HAS HIT IT A LITTLE BIT TOO HARD 
YOU WERE SAYING DENNIS THAT THE 
BLACK WAS IN A GOOD POSITION FOR 
SNOOKERS 
THAT IS WHY I THOUGHT ALI SNOOKERS MIGHT HAVE POTTED THE YELLOW AND 
PLAYED OFF THE GREEN TO GET UP 
THERE 
FOUL 
GOOD JOB HE NEEDED A 
SNOOKER THE REFEREE WOULD NOT HAVE 
LIKED TO HAVE PUT THOSE BACK 
CARTER KEPT GOING MANFULLY BUT 
O'SULLIVAN'S GRIP ON THE TITLE 
TITANS IT TIGHTENS 
IT LOOKS LIKE ALI CARTER IT 
LOOKED LIKE ALI CARTER MIGHT HAVE 
GLIMMER OF HOPE BUT THE CONCESSION 
COMES AND O'SULLIVAN NEEDS TWO MORE 
FRAMES TO WIN THIS TITLE FOR THE 
THIRD TIME HE WOULD BE ONLY THE 
THIRD MAN TO DO THAT AT THE 
CRUCIBLE STEVE DAVIS AND STEPHEN 
HENDRY BOTH PAST THAT TOTAL ALI IS 
GOING FOR QUICK BITE TO EAT IT 
HAS BEEN A VERY LONG SEVENTEEN DAYS ON 
THE BALANCE OF PLAY THIS AFTERNOON 
FIVE TO THREE RONNY WINS THE SESSION THERE 
IS NOT ANY WAY BACK 
DO YOU FEEL ONE 
IT IS TIME FOR 
THE CORONATION HE CANNOT POSSIBLY 
WIN MANFULLY WAS THE WORD HE KEPT 
IN THERE THIS AFTERNOON AND TRIED 
HIS BEST UNFORTUNATELY HE IS UNDER 
THE WEATHER MENTALLY AT THE MOMENT 
AND HE IS PLAYING AGAINST THE BEST 
MAN TO HOLD A CUE 
HOW MUCH 
PATIENCE IS WRONGLY SHOWING IT IS 
NOT GOING ALL HIS WAY BROMLEY 
IT HAS NOT BEEN PRETTY FROM 
RONNIE'S PERSPECTIVE AND WRONGLY 
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE PRETTY TO WIN 
WHEN HE NEEDED TO AGAINST STEPHEN 
HENDRY IN THE SEMI FINAL HE PUT IT 
ALL INTO THAT GAME HERE HE HAS PUT 
IN MORE OF A BREAD AND BUTTER 
PERFORMANCE IF YOUR GENERAL 
STANDARD IS A LOT HIGHER THAN THE 
OTHER MAN THAT IS ALL YOU NEED TO 
DO IT HAS NOT BEEN THE HIGHEST 
STANDARDS THIS MATCH THERE HAVE 
BEEN MORE MISTAKES THAN PEOPLE 
EXPECTED SOMETIMES THE PLAYERS 
FEED OFF EACH OTHER AND THERE WILL 
BE CENTURY BREAKS ALL THE TIME THE 
SAME CAN HAPPEN DEBILITATING DAY 
SOMEBODY MISSES A SHOT AND SOMEBODY 
ELSE MISSES A SHOT 
ON THE GENERAL 
POINT OF PATIENTS O'SULLIVAN'S 
GRAPES STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS IS 
THAT HE IS A PERFECTIONIST GREAT 
STRENGTH 
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE STRENGTH IT HAS BEEN THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE 
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HE HAS BEEN 
LOOK HE HAS LOOKED FOCUSED FROM 
THE START SOMETIMES HE HAS GOT TO 
EVENTS AND YOU CAN SEE HIS MIND 
WANDERING THIS IS A GOOD 
PERFORMANCE HE WILL BE IN HIS 
DRESSING ROOM HAVING WON THE 
SESSION FIVE TO THREE 
IT HAS BEEN THE SAME 
THROUGH THE SEASON IN THE BIGGEST 
TOURNAMENT OTHER THAN THIS THE U. K. 
CHAMPIONSHIP HE WAS SPOT ON 
THROUGHOUT THE TOURNAMENT IN THE 
LONGER MATCHES O'SULLIVAN IS SO 
HARD TO BEAT IT PUTS PRESSURE ON 
YOUR OPPONENT THAT MAN HAS TO NOT 
ONLY PLAY WELL AMONGST THE BALLS 
HE HAS TO PLAY GOOD SAFETY RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN IN FULL FLOW IS SUCH A 
HANDFUL 
YOU MENTIONED THE U. K. HANDFUL CHAMPIONSHIP THAT IS PLAYED OVER 
ELEVEN DAYS AND WE SAW THAT WONDERFUL 
PERFORMANCE AGAINST STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
THIS IS A DIFFERENT KETTLE OF FISH 
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE HOW 
LONG THIS TOURNAMENT MUST FEEL WHEN 
YOU GET TO THIS STAGE PHYSICALLY 
HOW DEBILITATED DO YOU FEEL BY THIS 
POINT 
IT IS PURELY MENTAL YOU POINT CANNOT SLEEP YOU ARE HYPED UP 
AFTER EVERY MATCH YOU ARE UP UNTIL 
TWO BUT TWO O'CLOCK OR THREE O'CLOCK 
IN THE MORNING WATCHING FILMS YOU 
WAKE UP A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER 
BECAUSE YOUR MIND IS WEARING ABOUT 
THREE OR FOUR DAYS AFTER THE 
TOURNAMENT HAS FINISHED YOU GO ONE 
UP YOUR MIND IS WHIRRING RONNIE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN WILL PROBABLY WIN THIS 
IN THE INTERVIEWS AFTERWARDS HE 
WILL PROBABLY SAY HE HAS FALLEN 
OVER THE LINE HE GOT THERE BY 
MOMENTUM WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT HE 
ACHIEVES ON THE TABLE HE IS BETTER 
THAN THAT BUT IN HIS MIND THAT IS 
WHAT HE WILL FEEL ALI CARTER WILL 
FEEL IT WENT THE BUBBLE BURST ALL 
OF A SUDDEN WHATEVER I HAD 
SOMEHOW I LOST IT HE WILL FEEL 
DISAPPOINTED WITH HIMSELF AND HE 
WILL THINK ACTUALLY IT OUGHT IT 
WAS NOT A BAD PAY DAY 
CLEARLY ALI 
CARTER STILL HAS A CHANCE IN THIS 
MATCH IF THINGS GO WELL TONIGHT 
OVERALL WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE 
ACHIEVEMENT SHOULD RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN DO THIS WHAT DO YOU 
THINK IT CONFIRMS IN OUR MIND ABOUT 
HIS PEDIGREE AND HIS POTENTIAL IN 
THE GAME ONE HUNDRED TO ONE THAT HE WILL GO ON 
TO WIN EIGHT WORLD TITLES 
I DON'T 
KNOW ABOUT THE ODDS FOR THAT HE 
DOES NOT KNOW HOW LONG HE WILL GO 
ON PLAYING FOR HIM TO ONLY WHEN IT 
THREE TIMES WOULD BE AN INSULT TO 
THE GAME HE IS THAT GOOD HE 
SHOULD BE IN THE SAME BALL PARK AS 
STEVE DAVIS AND STEPHEN HENDRY SIX 
OR SEVEN TIMES WINNER BECAUSE HE IS 
THAT GOOD 
JOHN HIGGINS WE SAID 
THE SAME ABOUT HIM WHEN HE WON HIS 
SECOND IT WOULD CONVERT RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN INTO BEING ONE OF THE 
GREATS OF THE GAME 
IT COULD BE A 
FIGHT BACK IT COULD BE A 
CORONATION THE TROPHY LOOKS LIKE 
IT IS GOING TO RONNIE O'SULLIVAN GOODBYE FOR NOW 
TRAFFIC NOISE POLLUTION CROWDS I HAVE THE PERFECT REMEDY 
LET'S ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRY
