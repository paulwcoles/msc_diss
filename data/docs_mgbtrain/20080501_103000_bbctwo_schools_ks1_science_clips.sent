BOING BOING 
HA HA HA HA 
OH 
WHEN A CAR'S LIFE ON THE ROAD ENDS 
IT MAY BE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN IN A CRASH OR BITS OF IT DON'T WORK 
SOME CARS GET A CHANCE FOR ANOTHER LIFE COMPLETELY 
THE RACE HAS JUST STARTED I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A BANGER RACE BEFORE 
THEY ALL LOOK LIKE CARS TO ME NOW NOISY ONES 
WHAT'LL HAPPEN BY THE END OF THE RACE THEY WON'T LOOK LIKE CARS 
THEY'RE ALL NICE AND STRAIGHT NOW THEY'LL CHANGE SHAPE 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SMASHED AND CRASHED THEY'LL BE UNRECOGNIZABLE 
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE THEY'RE AWAY OH RIGHT 
I WAS GETTING WHAT I WANTED I'D NEVER SEEN SO MUCH TWISTED METAL 
BUT WHAT KEPT CROSSING MY MIND WAS WASN'T THIS DANGEROUS 
APPARENTLY NOT 
WE'RE SAFELY HARNESSED IN I WAS GOING TO SAY WELL HARNESSED IN 
YOU BUILD THE CAR PROPERLY YOU MAKE SURE IT'S RUNNING RIGHT 
YOU MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SAFE BEFORE YOU GO OUT 
WE'RE TALKING CONTROLLED CRASHES THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
ONCE YOUR CAR LOOKS LIKE THAT YOU GET OUT YOU GET OUT AND RUN 
AND AT THE END OF THE RACE 
READY TO BE SQUASHED AND CHOPPED BY A RECYCLING CENTRE 
A W. W. W. 
HA HA HA HA HA HAA 
THIS IS MORPH AND WHEN IT COMES TO CHANGING SHAPE HE'S AN EXPERT 
BECAUSE HE CAN CHANGE INTO ANYTHING HE WANTS 
THE MAN WHO KNOWS MORPH'S EVERY MOVE IS PETER LORD 
HE WORKS AT AARDMAN ANIMATIONS AND HAS CREATED ALL SORTS OF FIGURES 
BUT HOW AND FROM WHAT WHERE IS HE THEN 
THIS IS HIM HOLD ON THAT'S JUST A PIECE OF PLASTICINE 
THAT'S WHAT MORPH'S MADE OUT OF WHERE ARE HIS ARMS AND LEGS 
I HAVE TO SQUASH HIM OUT OF A LUMP OF PLASTICINE 
I SQUASH HIM INTO A MORPH SHAPE THE GREAT THING ABOUT PLASTICINE 
IS THAT WHEN YOU MODEL IT IT STAYS WHERE YOU PUT IT 
THAT'S REALLY CLEVER CAN I HAVE A GO YEAH 
IT'S QUITE TOUGH WHEN YOU FIRST PICK IT UP IT'S COLD AND HARD 
SQUASH IT IN YOUR HANDS AND IT GETS SOFTER AND EASIER TO WORK 
MAYBE I COULD MAKE SOMETHING YEAH 
I DON'T THINK I'LL BE VERY GOOD SO I'LL LEAVE IT TO THE PROFESSIONAL 
MAKE US A MORPH O. K. 
I LOVE MORPH BECAUSE YOU CAN TELL HOW HE'S FEELING FROM HIS FACE 
HOW DO YOU MAKE HIM LOOK SURPRISED I THINK WHAT I'D DO 
SHOW ME HOW YOU LOOK SURPRISED AND I'LL COPY YOU RIGHT READY YEAH 
GREAT SO WE'VE GOT BIG WIDE EYES OPEN MOUTH AND HANDS UP HERE 
I'LL DO THAT WITH MORPH AND WATCH AND SEE IF HE LOOKS SURPRISED 
HEY WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT IT A MORPH MODELLED ON ME 
PLASTICS ARE MADE FROM NATURAL MATERIALS SUCH AS WOOD COAL OR OIL 
THESE NATURAL MATERIALS ARE CHANGED INTO SYNTHETIC MATERIALS 
WITH DIFFERENT PROPERTIES 
SOMETIMES SOFT ENOUGH TO MOULD BEND OR STRETCH INTO DIFFERENT SHAPES 
PLASTIC CAN BE MADE THIN AND TRANSPARENT 
OR THICK AND OPAQUE 
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WITH IT AND WHAT YOU WANT TO MAKE 
ALL THESE THINGS ARE MADE FROM DIFFERENT KINDS OF PLASTIC 
THIS COMB IS MADE FROM NYLON 
THIS FROM POLYSTYRENE 
THIS JEWELLERY IS MADE FROM PERSPEX 
AND THESE TOYS ARE POLYTHENE ALL NAMES FOR KINDS OF PLASTIC 
D. A. DAHH 
SOMETIMES HEAT CAN CHANGE THINGS IN A REALLY EXCITING WAY 
SYLVAN IS A GLASS BLOWER 
HE USES THE EFFECT OF HEAT TO MAKE BEAUTIFUL OBJECTS OUT OF GLASS 
THE GLASS STARTS OFF AS SAND 
A BIT LIKE THE SAND YOU MIGHT FIND ON THE BEACH 
BUT HEATED TO A HIGH TEMPERATURE AND IT MELTS INTO LIQUID GLASS 
SILVAN KEEPS RETURNING THE GLASS TO THE FURNACE TO KEEP IT RED HOT 
BECAUSE WHEN IT'S THAT HOT 
IT'S SOFT AND CAN BE FORMED INTO BEAUTIFUL SHAPES
