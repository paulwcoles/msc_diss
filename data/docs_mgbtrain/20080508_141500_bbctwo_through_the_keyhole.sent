TO OUR SPECIAL HOME INVESTIGATOR DETECTIVE INSPECTOR LISA SNOWDON 
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MANY STRINGS TO YOUR BOW IF YOU'RE A FARMER 
WITH THE SHEEP THE COWS AND THE FAMILY YOU'LL NEED THEM 
YOU CAN THROW AWAY YOUR MINK COAT GIVE BACK YOUR RING AND YOUR PEARLS 
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT DRIVES YOU THAT COUNTS 
OR IS IT WHAT YOU DRIVE HMM BETTER MAKE SURE IT'S THE LATEST TOP MODEL 
THE CLUES ARE ALL THERE BUT WHO'S PLAYING THE GAME TODAY 
PLAYING THE GAME TODAY IS OUR PANEL 
AND WHAT A PANEL THEY ARE 
THEY'VE HAD THEIR ELECTRONIC TAGS ESPECIALLY REMOVED 
JUST SO THEY CAN BE WITH US TODAY OUR FIRST GUEST IS AN OLYMPIC ATHLETE 
BUT EARLIER TODAY THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIM 
SO WE CALLED HIS SECRETARY WHO SAID I'M SORRY HE'S RUNNING TEN MINUTES LATE 
THAT'S A FIRST FOR I. WAN THOMAS 
OUR NEXT GUEST TELLS ME SHE IS THE UNLUCKIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD 
SHE'S JUST BOUGHT A NON STICK PAN AND CAN'T GET THE LABEL OFF 
THAT'S ME WILL YOU WELCOME MISS GLORIA HUNNIFORD 
OUR FINAL GUEST IS A LEADING VOCAL COACH 
I ASKED HIM HOW MANY COUNTRY AND WESTERN SINGERS DOES IT TAKE TO CHANGE A LIGHTBULB 
AND HE SAID ONE TO CHANGE IT AND TWO TO SING ABOUT THE OLD ONE 
HERE HE IS DAVID GRANT 
NOW FOR THE GAME A GAME OF TWO HALVES 
THE FIRST HALF INSPECTION AS OUR DIVINE HOUSE DETECTIVE LISA SNOWDON 
SUBJECTS THE TWO HOMES OF TWO WELL KNOWN PERSONALITIES TO FORENSIC EXAMINATION 
THE SECOND HALF DETECTION AS OUR EAGLE EYED PANEL 
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HELP FROM OUR STUDIO AUDIENCE 
TRIES TO SOLVE THE RIDDLE OF JUST WHO LIVES IN HOMES LIKE THESE 
SO PICK UP YOUR MAGNIFYING GLASSES AND WATCH CLOSELY BECAUSE 
REMEMBER THE CLUES ARE THERE AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
IF YOU HEAR THE NOISE OF ROARING TRAFFIC OR POLICE SIRENS SCREAMING 
IT'S JUST THE HURLY BURLY OF MODERN LONDON WHICH IS WHERE I AM MANY MANY MILES AWAY 
FROM THE LUSH ROLLING PASTURES OF ENGLAND'S GREEN AND PLEASANT LAND 
AND INSTANT IMPRESSIONS ARE A PLEASANT FAMILY HOME 
A WHOLE STAND OF WARM WINTER WOOLLY COATS 
JUST THE THING TO RUG UP AND GO FOR A WALK IN THE COUNTRY 
IN THE STAND HERE LOTS OF BROLLIES OF COURSE 
AND SEVERAL WICKED LOOKING SWORDS 
JUST THE THING TO DETER FOOTPADS CUTPURSES AND VILLAINS 
THIS IS RATHER GRAND ANOTHER FAMILY RESIDENCE 
PERHAPS SHADES OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WITH THE OFFICER'S SWORD AND THE GRAND HOUSE 
YOU DON'T THINK WE COULD BE TALKING ROYALTY DO YOU 
THERE'S A PASSION FOR MAPS DISPLAYED HERE BUT THIS ONE INTERESTS ME 
IT'S REMINISCENT OF A DREAMY ENGLAND 
WITH A RIVER RUNNING THROUGH A PICTURESQUE VILLAGE 
I GET A REAL SENSE OF COMMUNITY HERE 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A BIG FAMILY 
AND AN OLD FAMILY GOING BACK A LONG LONG WAY 
I CAN IMAGINE THEM AS LANDED GENTRY 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE ACTION CENTRE OF THE HOUSE 
DOMINATED BY THIS VERY PROFESSIONAL MICROPHONE AND A MIXING DESK 
THERE'S GUITARS HANGING ON THE WALL AND THIS VERY TUNEFUL BANJO 
YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE SITTING ON YOUR HAY WAGON SERENADING MARY LOU 
WHILE THE CATTLE LOW GENTLY IN THE BACKGROUND I'LL DO IT AGAIN YEE HA 
THERE IS A FEEL FOR TRADITION HERE 
ALTHOUGH WE ARE CLOSE TO CENTRAL LONDON IT'S LIKE THIS PERSON HAS GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY 
TO BRING THE COUNTRYSIDE ATMOSPHERE INTO THEIR HOME 
ISN'T THIS A GREAT ROOM IT'S GOT A REAL FARMHOUSE FEEL TO IT 
WITH ITS SOLID OAK FLOOR AND ITS BARE BRICKWORK 
FAMILY CONNECTIONS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO THIS PERSON 
LOOK AT THIS HANDSOME CHAP HERE 
THE COMMUNITY ITS HISTORY ITS CHARACTERS OLD AND NEW ARE WHAT'S DRIVING THIS PERSON 
DOESN'T IT MAKE A NICE CHANGE TO FIND A LOVELY SITTING ROOM 
THAT'S NOT DOMINATED BY A HUGE FORTY SIX INCH PLASMA SCREEN 
I THINK SO 
THIS IS AN INTERESTING COLLECTION 
YOU'VE GOT AN EARLY MAP FROM VAN DIEMEN'S LAND 
I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU TO MAKE OF THAT WHAT YOU WILL 
AH LOOK THEY'VE BEEN SO KIND AS TO LEAVE SOME CLUES 
OLD HARROW DAYS THAT'S THE EDUCATION TAKEN CARE OF 
AUSTRALIAN ACCENT OH YEAH 
AND TASMANIA BY ROAD 
YEAH THAT COULD BE USEFUL 
SO LET'S LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN

WELCOME TIM WELL THEY GOT CLOSE BUT THEY JUST DIDN'T GET THERE 
WELL IT'S A BIT DEPRESSING ISN'T IT 
I MEAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF TELLY 
YOU KNOW AS WELL AND THE RADIO 
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF OTHER THINGS BUT YOU JUST MISSED ME JUST BY A FRACTION 
THERE WAS TOTAL SILENCE WHEN THEY SAID HAS HE BEEN ON TELEVISION I WAS LIKE YES A LOT 
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU DONE TELEVISION ALL MY LIFE TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
SERIES SITCOMS DO YOU REMEMBER A THING CALLED BY THE SWORD DIVIDED YEARS AGO 
YES YES ABOUT THE CAVALIER HERO I WAS THE CAVALIER HERO 
HENCE THE SWORD THERE WAS A BIT OF MILITARY THERE 
I USED TO TAKE THAT SWORD AND GO OUT IN THE GARDEN AND PRACTISE IT WHEN I WAS HAVING TO DO MY SWORD FIGHTS 
I'M DISAPPOINTED YOU DIDN'T BRING YOUR BANJO I SHOULD HAVE DONE 
IF I KNEW THAT WAS GONNA BE PART OF IT I'D HAVE COME ON BEARING THE BANJO 
DO YOU RECORD YOUR STUFF AT HOME NO I DON'T 
I DO LOTS OF VOICEOVERS THAT'S FOR DOING M. P. THREES DOWN THE LINE FOR TESTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
ALSO I DO MUSIC I'VE BEEN SPENDING MY ENTIRE LIFE TRYING TO GET SONGS DONE 
WE'RE NEARLY THERE DO YOU WRITE SONGS 
YEAH I WRITE SONGS AND RECORD THEM AT HOME 
THAT'S WHY ALL THE MIXER DESK AND ALL THAT 
I DO IT ON THE KEYBOARDS AND DO ALL THE HOME RECORDING 
THAT'S WHY YOUR FILM ACTUALLY WAS QUITE MISLEADING TOTALLY 
THERE WERE MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THE FARMING THE MUSIC 
THE ACTING MILITARY BIG ESTATES I'VE GOT THIS SLIGHTLY POSH MILITARY BACKGROUND 
WHICH HAS GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH ME SO IT WAS A COMPLETE DISTRACTION 
HOW LONG AGO WAS THE MILITARY BACKGROUND 
MOST OF THE MALE SIDE OF THE BENTINCKS 
WERE EITHER SAILORS OR ARMY OR CHURCH 
ONE OF THE OTHER UNTIL IT CAME TO MY FATHER WHO IS AN ECCENTRIC 
AND WAS A B. B. C. TALKS PRODUCER AND THEN USED TO MAKE T. V. COMMERCIALS FOR J. WALTER THOMPSON 
OH REALLY YEAH 
GOT DOWN TO THE REAL LIFE GOT DOWN TO A REAL CHAP BY THEN 
AND WHERE DOES VAN DIEMENS LAND AS IT WERE 
TASMANIA WHERE DOES THAT FIT INTO THE STORY 
WELL I'VE JUST COME BACK FROM VAN DIEMENS LAND A WEEK AGO 
WHICH IS TASMANIA BECAUSE I WAS BORN THERE BECAUSE MY PA 
AFTER THE WAR HE WAS A PRISONER OF WAR FOR TWO YEARS HAD A HORRIBLE TIME 
WHEN HE CAME BACK TO ENGLAND IT WAS POST WAR RATIONING COLD NASTY AND HE SAW THIS ADVERT 
AT THAT TIME HE WAS A PRODUCER AT THE B. B. C. 
PRODUCING THE TODAY PROGRAMME IN ITS EARLY DAYS 
AND HE SAW THIS ADVERT SAYING JACKAROO WANTED FOR TASMANIAN SHEEP STATION 
BASICALLY A SHEEP SHEARER 
SO HE TOOK THE WHOLE FAMILY AND ALL THE FURNITURE AND THOSE PAINTINGS THAT YOU SAW EVERYTHING 
AND TOOK IT OFF TO A SHEEP STATION IN THE MIDDLE OF TASMANIA WHERE I'VE JUST COME BACK FROM 
AND I SAW THE PLACE WHERE I WAS BORN AND I MET THE DOCTOR 
WHO DELIVERED ME AND IT WAS ALL VERY EMOTIONAL AND LOVELY 
AMAZING LOVELY 
HOW DID YOU FEEL MOVED I BET 
IT WAS VERY MOVING AND WHAT WAS YOU SAID ALSO THAT YOU DO LOTS OF VOICEOVERS 
DO YOU DO ONE FOR THE UNDERGROUND IS IT 
I AM THE VOICE OF MIND THE GAP ON THE PICCADILLY LINE 
WHEN YOU'RE TICKING THE BOXES OF FAME ALBEIT WITHOUT THE FACE UNFORTUNATELY 
YES SO DAVID ARCHER AND MIND THE GAP 
IT WAS SO SILLY I DO A LOT OF VOICEOVERS I'VE GOT A VOICEOVER AGENT 
THEY RANG ONE DAY AND SAID YOU'RE GOING TO DO A RECORDING 
I SAID WHAT IS IT THEY SAID STATION ANNOUNCEMENT 
SO I TURNED UP AND SAID HELLO STATION ANNOUNCEMENT WHAT'S IT FOR 
HE SAID THE PICCADILLY LINE 
I SAID WHAT MIND THE GAP HA HA 
AND HE WENT YES 
IF YOU LISTEN CAREFULLY BETWEEN KING'S CROSS AND EARL'S COURT 
IT'S NOT ONLY MIND THE GAP IT'S PLEASE STAND CLEAR OF THE CLOSING DOORS 
THE NEXT STATION IS COVENT GARDEN THAT VOICE 
COULD YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE 
THIS IS THIS IS HOLBORN THE NEXT STATION IS COVENT GARDEN 
PLEASE STAND CLEAR OF THE CLOSING DOORS 
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S YOU 
YOU'RE THE MAN IT'S A HIT 
JUST TO FINISH THAT STORY OFF I THOUGHT I AM IN THE MONEY 
YOU KNOW ZERO ONE P. EVERY TIME IT'S PLAYED 
AND I RANG THE AGENT AND SAID HOW MUCH IS THAT 
SHE SAID IT'S A TWO HUNDRED QUID BUY OUT 
OH NO THAT WAS IT TWO HUNDRED FOREVER THEY CAN PLAY IT FOREVER 
FOREVER FOR TWO HUNDRED QUID 
WELL THEY'RE GREAT TALES OF A GREAT EVENTFUL LIFE AND IT'S A JOY 
TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT YOU WITH THIS THE THROUGH THE KEYHOLE KEY TIM FANTASTIC 
TO SAY IT'S BEEN A DELIGHT TO HAVE YOU WITH US TIM BENTINCK 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
TIM BENTINCK TIM BENTINCK 
SO LET'S JOIN LISA AGAIN NOW 
LET'S JOIN HER AT HOUSE NUMBER TWO 
AND WATCH CLOSELY 
BECAUSE THE CLUES ARE THERE AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
I'M IN MAIDENHEAD NEAR THE RIVER THAMES 
WELL ACTUALLY YOU CAN'T GET MUCH CLOSER TO IT 
I'M ON THE THAMES AND THE RIVER IS RISING 
BUT DON'T WORRY BECAUSE WE HAVE A BOAT 
AND THERE'S A PIPE THERE 
OCCASIONALLY POURING OUT WATER BECAUSE THE RIVER IS RISING 
WE SHOULD REALLY GET THIS DONE BECAUSE WE COULD FLOOD 
NO WE REALLY COULD 
I HAVE TO SAY IT TAKES A BRAVE PERSON TO LIVE THIS CLOSE TO THE RIVER 
WELL EITHER BRAVE OR SOMEONE WHO HAS TAKEN A FEW RISKS IN THEIR LIFE 
THAT SEES LIFE AS SOMETHING TO BE LIVED TO THE FULL 
AND PERHAPS EVEN ENJOYS A TOUCH OF JEOPARDY AND DANGER 
I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT SOMEONE'S CAMPING HERE 
IT'S LIKE A BEDOUIN TENT WITH DRAPES EVERYWHERE AND KNICK KNACKS 
COLLECTED FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD THERE'S SO MUCH TO SEE IN ONE ROOM 
IT'S A MISH MASH OF STYLES BUT ODDLY WORKS AS THOUGH SOMEONE MIGHT NOT BE TOO SURE OF THEIR TRUE IDENTITY 
SO WHEN THEY FIND A KNICK KNACK THAT CATCHES THEIR EYE 
THEY ADD IT TO THEIR COLLECTION RATHER LIKE TAKING IN LAME DUCKS 
THIS ISN'T SO MUCH OF A BOLT HOLE IT IS MORE OF A BOAT HOLE 
AFTER ALL WE ARE IN A CONVERTED BOATHOUSE 
IT'S CERTAINLY COSY 
THIS IS DEFINITELY THE HOME OF A FREE SPIRIT 
NOT AN ECCENTRIC BUT A DYNAMIC COLOURFUL PERSONALITY 
AND THIS IS VERY MUCH THEIR SPACE 
IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO START BUT LET'S LOOK FOR THEIR ROOTS 
AND TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT THE RISING WATER 
I WOULD SAY THERE'S AN ESSENCE OF AFRICA HERE 
WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL CARVED ELEPHANT SITTING UNDER THE TREE 
AND AN ACTIVE PERSON WITH THE SADDLE HERE READY TO GO 
THIS IS A REAL DEN ISN'T IT 
YOU COULD LIVE ON THIS AND I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY DO 
I KEEP LOOKING AT THE RIVER HERE 
AND IT SEEMS TO BE GETTING HIGHER AND HIGHER 
IF I LIVED HERE I'D BE QUITE NERVOUS 
THERE'S SOME INTERESTING BITS AND PIECES HERE 
WE'VE GOT THIS PROPER CAMPING PICTURE 
AND SOME AFRICAN LADIES HERE ENJOYING A KNEES UP 
AND THERE'S AN ANGEL WITH A BROKEN WING 
COULD THIS BE A FALLEN ANGEL 
CAN I JUST TELL YOU A COUPLE OF THINGS 
THE NOISE YOU CAN HEAR IS THE FLOOD DEFENCE SYSTEM AND THE OTHER NOISE IS LITTLE HUCKLEBERRY 
WHO IS GETTING STUCK INTO PISTACHIOS COS HE LOVES PISTACHIOS 
HE'S CHOMPING AWAY 
THIS PERSON HAS TRAVELLED ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THESE BOOKS DEMONSTRATE IT 
THE WORST JOURNEY IN THE WORLD WOMEN TRAVELLERS 
AND IN FACT I HAVE TRAVELLED WITH THIS PERSON 
TO MARRAKECH AND TO RIO TO MAKE A T. V. SERIES 
NOT ONLY ARE THEY GREAT TRAVELLERS BUT THEY'VE ALSO LIVED IN SOME OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST CITIES 
BE HONEST YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE SO FAR WHO IT IS BECAUSE I'VE TAKEN YOU ROUND THE HOUSES 
IT COULD BE A TRAVELLER PERHAPS A WRITER MAYBE EVEN AN ACTRESS 
LET ME HELP YOU OUT BY OPENING THE MIRROR 
THIS IS MORE LIKE IT 
BY NOW YOU'VE PROBABLY FIGURED OUT THAT IT'S NOT A BLOKE IT'S A LADY WITH A WARDROBE FIT FOR A MODEL 
LOTS OF LEGGY TROUSERS BEAUTIFUL FLOOR LENGTH DESIGNER GOWNS 
LOTS OF POINTY SHOES 
TONS OF BLING AND 
A VERY NICE LINE IN HATS 
STILL NO FUR COAT THOUGH 
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN THE AFRICAN CONNECTION 
THE WORKING WARDROBE AND THE NOMADIC LIFESTYLE 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
WELL THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED LISA 
AND NOW FOR OUR HOME AND STUDIO AUDIENCE HERE'S WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
DAVID YOUR TURN 
O. K. 
THIS PERSON ENJOYS RISK AND JEOPARDY WE SAW 
AND WE ALSO SAW A SADDLE UM 
DOES THIS PERSON RIDE 
I THINK SO SHE DOES UM 
SHE'S ASSOCIATED WITH AFRICA FALLEN ANGEL WELL TRAVELLED 
IS SHE A MODEL 
A MODEL MODEL YES A MODEL YES 
RIGHT IS A MODEL HER FULL TIME OCCUPATION 
MORE OR LESS SHE DOES OTHER THINGS TOO BUT BASICALLY IT'S HER MAIN OCCUPATION 
DOES SHE WRITE NOT AT ALL TIMES BUT WHEN SHE IS DOING IT 
DOES SHE TRAVEL WRITE SHE'S WRITTEN ABOUT HER TRAVELS BUT NOT 
SHE TRAVELS THROUGH HER JOB AS A MODEL YES 
NOT AS A JOURNALIST SHE'S GOT AN INTERESTING HOUSE 
REALLY INTERESTING 
ALL THOSE REFERENCES TO WATER AND FLOODING AND RISING WATER HMM RED HERRING 
LISA HAS TRAVELLED WITH HER 
AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THROUGH MODELLING OR WHATEVER 
BUT ARE WE LOOKING FOR A FORMER MODEL SOMEONE WHO HAS MODELLED YEARS AGO 
YES I MEAN SHE STILL DOES MODELLING JOBS FROM TIME TO TIME 
BUT WE WOULD KNOW HER MORE FROM MODELLING A LITTLE WAY BACK 
THE REASON I SAY THAT IS THE HOUSE LOOKS QUITE HOMELY 
AND ALMOST MOTHERLY RATHER THAN A YOUNG NOWADAYS MODEL IF THAT MAKES SENSE 
THAT'S A VERY DIPLOMATIC WAY OF PUTTING IT 
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IT LOOKS LIVED IN 
AND IF SHE WAS MODELLING NOW SHE'D BE ALL OVER THE WORLD 
YES IT LOOKS LIKE A HOME 
BUT SHE IS OBVIOUSLY 
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL MODEL 
BECAUSE SHE TRAVELLED THE WORLD 
AND I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY 
THE CLOTHES LOOKED LONG 
A CATWALK MODEL YES SHE IS GOING TO BE TALL 
YES WE CAN ASSUME A VERY TALL MODEL BY THE LENGTH OF THOSE TROUSERS 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT PHOTOGRAPHIC MYSELF 
AH BUT YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I WE DON'T ACTUALLY AT THIS POINT 
WHAT'S THE FALLEN ANGEL 
HAS SHE PUBLICLY DONE VERY WELL AND THEN PERHAPS GONE DOWN A SLIPPERY SLOPE AND GOT BACK UP 
OH IS IT THE GIRL WHO WAS CAUGHT DRUNK 
WHO ACTUALLY WAS CAUGHT OVER THE LIMIT IN TERMS OF DRIVING 
ER PAULA IS IT PAULA HAMILTON HAMILTON 
PAULA HAMILTON IT IS 
PAULA HAMILTON WILL YOU COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
I WASN'T IMPLYING YOU WERE I DIDN'T PUT IT VERY DELICATELY EITHER 
YOU'RE LOOKING FANTASTIC THANK YOU YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING TERRIFIC THANK YOU 
YOU HAVE REALLY HAD QUITE A ROLLER COASTER LIFE I HAVE I LOVE THAT 
WHEN I WAS PUTTING THE HOUSE TOGETHER I LITERALLY HAD TWO HOURS 
BECAUSE I HAD BEEN FLOODED BEFORE THE FLOOD DEFENCE HAD GONE IN 
AND I KNEW YOU GUYS WERE COMING 
I WAS THINKING I CAN'T SAY THEY CAN'T COME IN 
BUT I WAS FLOODED AND I HAD TO BELIEVE THAT I COULD GET THE SYSTEM IN 
AND GET MY BELONGINGS BACK IN SO EVERYTHING WAS PUT IN 
AND THAT ANGEL SORT OF WENT DINK AND WE HAD TO PUT THE WING BACK ON 
THERE YOU WERE WHAT WAS IT BROKEN ANGEL FALLEN ANGEL 
IT LOOKED BEAUTIFUL THOUGH 
SO LIVE ABLE AND SO GORGEOUS 
MOTHERLY YOU SAID AS WELL I MEAN OH NO 
WHAT I MEANT YUMMY MUMMY YEAH 
WHERE DID YOU GET THEM 
THEY ARE PRICELESS THEY'RE PRICELESS 
HE IS GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO EXCITED NOW 
ALL RIGHT PAULA ALL RIGHT 
TUNING IN I WILL SPEAK ON BEHALF OF I. WAN BECAUSE HE HAS LOST THE POWER OF SPEECH 
I THINK ON BRITAIN'S NEXT TOP MODEL YOU ARE FANTASTIC 
HOW DOES IT FEEL KNOWING WHAT IT REQUIRES TO BE A TOP MODEL 
WHEN YOU SEE THESE PEOPLE COMING THROUGH 
SOME OF WHOM I CAN TELL FROM YOUR FACE YOU DON'T THINK HAVE GOT A HOPE OF MAKING IT 
UM YOU CAN TELL FROM MY FACE YOU CAN I KNOW 
I SHOULD BOTOX MYSELF SO I'M SITTING THERE LIKE THIS 
BECAUSE MY FACE GIVES EVERYTHING AWAY 
YOU KNOW LIKE OH NO SHE'S NOT GOING TO WORK 
WHAT IT IS I BELIEVE THERE'S SO MUCH OUT THERE 
DAVID KNOWS YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR DONKEY'S YEARS 
YOU KNOW WHAT MODELS GO THROUGH 
BUT YOU HAVE JUST LIKE ME YES 
WE ARE DINOSAURS DARLINGS 
I'M FORTY SEVEN FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE 
I SHOULD BE ON THE TRASH TIP 
BUT I'M NOT I'M STILL HERE 
AS A MODEL YOUR LIFESPAN IS VERY VERY SHORT 
BUT IT CAN ALSO BE VERY VERY LONG 
AND WE WERE REQUIRED TO BE MODELS 
AND THE COMMERCIAL MADE ME INTO A HOUSEHOLD NAME 
THAT WAS JUST EXTRAORDINARY I HAD NO CONCEPT OF EVEN WHAT WAS GOING ON IN ENGLAND 
I WAS LIVING IN NEW YORK AS A MODEL 
I WAS ASKED TO COME OVER TO PRESENT MYSELF AT A CASTING WHICH I DID 
IN A PAIR OF DOCTOR MARTENS WITH A PAINTBRUSH IN MY POCKET 
WHICH I FORGOT TO TAKE OUT BECAUSE I WAS DECORATING 
AND MY HAIR WAS KIND OF IN A CORN LIKE THAT 
FROM A BEER COMMERCIAL THAT HAS GOT A WHITE TOP 
THEY TRIED TO MAKE MY HAIR LOOK LIKE THE TOP OF A BEER 
SO I'M SITTING THERE WITH THIS PAINTBRUSH AND MY HAIR LIKE THIS 
AND ALL THESE GORGEOUS MODELS SITTING THERE 
I'M THINKING OH GOD I WISH I HADN'T BOTHERED 
AND I GET CALLED IN BY BAILEY AND IT CHANGED MY LIFE 
ABSOLUTELY CHANGED MY LIFE BECAUSE I DECIDED TO GET MARRIED AND STAY HERE 
THAT CHANGED MY LIFE DRAMATICALLY 
BUT THEN THE COMMERCIAL SORT OF CAUGHT UP 
I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE ARENA OF CELEBRITIES OR ANYTHING ELSE 
I WAS A PURE THOROUGHBRED MODEL 
THERE ARE PURE POLAR BEARS AND THERE ARE PURE MODELS 
YOU DON'T GET ANY MIXTURES IN THEM 
SO I MEAN WE WEREN'T EXPECTED TO DO THE TALK SHOWS 
WE WEREN'T EXPECTED TO TURN UP AT PREMIERES 
WE WERE JUST EXPECTED TO DO OUR WORK AND THEN GO HOME 
AND NOW THEY ARE EXPECTED TO DO SO SO MUCH MORE 
THERE'S SO MUCH THROWN AT THEM 
WHEN I'M SITTING THERE AND I'M JUDGING 
I'M THINKING HAS THIS GIRL GOT IT CAN SHE REALLY STAND UP FOR HERSELF 
OR AM I FEEDING ANOTHER EMOTIONAL CRIPPLE LIKE I WAS MYSELF 
INTO AN INDUSTRY THAT'S JUST GOING TO GO NAH NAH NAH NAH NA SHALL I DO THAT AGAIN 
NAH NAH NAH NAH NA VERY GOOD 
VERY GOOD SOUND AND YOU MENTIONED BAILEY THERE 
DID BAILEY DO THE V. W. GOLF PHOTOS OR NOT 
IT WAS MAINLY A RIDLEY SCOTT FILM CREW THAT DAVID BAILEY WAS USING 
SO IT WAS SHOT AS IF YOU WERE SEEING A VIGNETTE OF A FILM 
LITTLE DID I KNOW THE PRINCESS OF WALES AND JAMES HEWITT WERE HAVING A FRIENDSHIP 
AND WE WERE COMING OUT OF MUSES BECAUSE I WAS LIVING 
IN A BROWNSTONE IN NEW YORK YOU KNOW 
AND I WASN'T TUNED INTO THE LIFE HERE 
WHAT'S EXTRAORDINARY IS I BET EVERYBODY REMEMBERS THAT COMMERCIAL 
SO CLEARLY THE VARIOUS COMMERCIALS THAT YOU MADE 
IT REALLY MADE AN INDELIBLE MARK ON COMMERCIALS IN THIS COUNTRY FABULOUS 
THANK YOU THANK YOU 
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT YOU HAVE MADE AN INDELIBLE MARK THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON ALL OF US 
AN INDELIBLE MARK AND LET ME MAKE THIS INDELIBLE PRESENT TO YOU 
OH DAVID THERE WE ARE 
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS FOR YOU 
OUR THANKS TO PAULA 
TO PAULA HAMILTON AND TO TIM BENTINCK 
AND OF COURSE TO OUR PANEL 
I. WAN THOMAS THERE 
GLORIA HUNNIFORD AND DAVID GRANT 
UNTIL THE NEXT TIME GOODBYE FOR NOW
