NERVOUS AT ALL YEAH YEAH ERDEM 
PRETTY NERVOUS NOT AZNER ERDEM SERIOUS AS YESTERDAY BUT MY HEART 
IS BEATING FAST 
JADRAN DUNCUMB 
REALLY NERVOUS THOUGHT IT WOULD 
BE EASIER TODAY 
IS ANYBODY FEELING 
EXCITED ABOUT TONIGHT'S PERFORMANCE 
PETER 
I'VE BEEN EXCITED MORE THAN PETER NER SERIOUS AT THE MOMENT BUT I'M 
STILL NERVOUS 
DOES ANYBODY FEEL THAT YESTERDAY'S 
PERFORMANCE IS GOING TO HELP YOU 
FOR THIS EVENING 
I CAN IMAGINE 
THAT MOST OF YESTERDAY'S 
PERFORMANCE IS AS MUCH AS ANYTHING 
PRACTICE FOR TODAY IN A WAY L. 
THINK TODAY IS REALLY IMPORTANT 
BUT THEY'RE BOTH EQUALLY 
IMPORTANT.THAT'S WONDERFUL IMPORTANTTHAT'S WONDERFUL WE'RE NOW GOING TO GO OVER TO

IMPORTANT PEOPLE 
YES IT'S THE JUDGES ARE YOU 
FEELING NERVOUS YES YES I CAN IMAGINE BEN YOU'VE BEEN 
CHAIR OF THE JUDGING PANEL SINCE 
THE BEGINNING OF THE COMPETITION 
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON TO ASK AS A 
GROUP WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THAT ONE MAGIC 
SPARK IN THE PERFORMANCE TONIGHT 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MOMENT THAT 
LIFTS THE AUDIENCE TO THE EDGE OF 
THEIR SEATS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF

MOMENT FROM THE CONCERTO OF 
YESTERDAY WE SUGGESTED PIECE 
THEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING

BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THIS STAGE 
THE OPPORTUNITY OF PLAYING A 
CONCERTO WITH AN ORCHESTRA AND 
AUDIENCE IN THIS SIZE OF A HALL IS 
REALLY EXCITING MORE THAN ANYTHING 
ELSE L. THINK MANY THINGS ABOUT HOW

CATEGORIES FIVE TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
INSTRUMENTS 
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE INSTRUMENTS AS A CONDUCTOR I'M VERY AWARE THAT 
THESE MUSICIANS ARE COMING HERE AND 
DOING SOMETHING INCREDIBLY FAST

MUSIC ON THEIR OWN PRACTISING LIKE 
DEMONS AND THEY HAVE TO COME HERE

HAVE TO MAKE THEIR RHYTHM 
DIFFERENTLY THEY HAVE TO SHARE 
THEIR IDEAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY 
THEY HAVE TO LISTEN AND REACT TO 
THE MUSIC COMING FROM THIS GREAT 
INSTRUMENT BEHIND THEM THAT'S MADE
