THANK YOU THANK YOU 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO WHAT IS TONIGHT A TOP GEAR SPECIAL 
IT'S SPECIAL BECAUSE IT IS JUST ONE BIG FILM 
YEP AND TO MAKE IT WE HAD TO GO ON HOLIDAY 
YOU SAY IT WAS A HOLIDAY BUT IT WAS A FLY DRIVE HOLIDAY 
SO IT WASN'T A HOLIDAY AT ALL BECAUSE YOU GET TO THE CAR HIRE DESK 
AND THERE'S THE GORMLESS MAN WITH THE SPIKY HAIR 
HE TYPES WAR AND PEACE INTO HIS COMPUTER FOR SIXTEEN HOURS 
AND THEN HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE ENGLAND IS 
AND HE STEALS YOUR DRIVING LICENCE 
AND THEN HE DIRECTS YOU TO A CAR PARK WHERE YOUR CAR ISN'T 
SO WE WERE GOING TO TRY AND SEE IF WE COULD MAKE IT ANY BETTER 
RATHER THAN SUFFER THE MISERY OF HIRING A CAR 
MAYBE IT MADE MORE SENSE TO BUY ONE 
WE WERE EACH GIVEN A BUDGET OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
NOW HERE IS THE REALLY CLEVER BIT 
AT THE END OF OUR HOLIDAY WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A ROAD TRIP 
ACROSS FOUR STATES WE WOULD SEE IF INSTEAD OF SIMPLY HAVING TO HAND THE HIRE CAR BACK 
WE COULD SELL OUR CARS AND GET MOST OF THE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK 
IT WAS BRILLIANT 
NOW IN THE HOLIDAY WE HAD STONES THROWN AT US BY REDNECKS 
WE CRASHED INTO A RIVER FULL OF ALLIGATORS 
WE WHAT ELSE HAPPENED 
OH WE HAD TO EAT A SQUIRREL 
ANYWAY THE BIG CHALLENGE WAS 
COULD WE BUY A CAR FOR LESS THAN IT COST TO RENT ONE FOR A FORTNIGHT 
LET'S FIND OUT 
MIAMI HOT AND SUNNY 
THIRTY FOUR DEGREES 
YES MIAMI HOME TO ALL THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DRUG DEALERS 
THIS YEAR'S MR. BIG MAC 
AND SILICON VALLEY 
ALL VERY GLAMOROUS BUT OUR JOURNEY BEGAN HERE 
IN THE CITY'S USED CAR LOTS 
THIS IS WHERE WE HAD A MORNING TO FIND A SET OF WHEELS 
FOR LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND 
I THINK I'D QUITE LIKE TO TAKE THIS ONE FOR A TEST DRIVE 
WHAT'S UNDER THE BONNET OF THAT IT'S A V. SIX V. SIX YEAH 
GOT ANYTHING WITH A V. EIGHT 
I WANTED A MUSCLE CAR 
SO I WENT STRAIGHT TO A DEALERSHIP THAT SELLS CORVETTES' 
HAVE YOU GOT THE KEYS 
THANK YOU 
OH 
FOUR HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED HORSEPOWER FOR A FIFTY SEVEN L. V. EIGHT 
AH 
O. K. HOW MUCH IS IT 
SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTEEN DOLLARS 
SO 
SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS 
ZERO POINT EIGHT ONE FIVE 
THOUSAND DOLLARS 
YEAH 
WHAT IF I GAVE YOU ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR IT 
ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS MM 
RICHARD IT SEEMS WAS BEING SIMILARLY AMBITIOUS 
HOW MUCH IS THIS 
EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS 
I NEED SOMETHING A BIT LESS THAN THAT A LITTLE BIT LESS LESS THAN THAT 
SO HOW MUCH FOR A COUGAR 
COUGARS ARE ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY FIVE TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS 
DEPENDING ON THE CONDITION AND SO ON 
I NEED SOMETHING THAT'S A BIT LESS THAN THAT 
LESS THAN THAT HOW MUCH FOR A CHALLENGER 
CHALLENGERS START AT TWENTY THOUSAND NINETEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED LESS THAN THAT LESS THAN THAT LESS THAN THAT 
SEE THIS HERE LOOK 
HE'S TURNING RIGHT ON A RED LIGHT THAT IS AMERICA'S ONLY CONTRIBUTION TO WESTERN CIVILISATION 
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME TO BUY 
I WAS THE ONLY ONE USING EVEN A MODICUM OF COMMON SENSE 
WOULD YOU TAKE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THIS 
O. K. ER THAT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT 
SOON I TOOK A LEAF OUT OF JAMES'S BOOK LOWERED MY SIGHTS 
AND QUICKLY FOUND A TIDY CAMARO AT A PLACE CALLED ADOLF'S 
TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS THIS 
IT'S A BIG ASK TO GET HIM DOWN TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
I MIGHT OFFER HIM A BURGER 
VERY POPULAR WITH MURDERERS THESE CARS YEAH 
MEANWHILE I'D FOUND SOMETHING WE DON'T HAVE IN BRITAIN A DEALERSHIP 
SPECIALISING IN EX GOVERNMENT CARS 
THIS WAS A POLICE CAR 
YOU CAN TELL BY THE COLOUR THE HOLE FOR THE AERIAL 
IT SAYS POLICE INTERCEPTOR ON IT 
THIS ONE WAS PROBABLY I DUNNO MAYBE A SPY COS THERE'S NO BADGING ON THAT 
THAT COULD'VE BEEN A MEN IN BLACK AND THAT WAS A VAT MAN 
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THEY'VE ALL BEEN PROPERLY MAINTAINED 
AND I'M TOLD THEY'RE DIRT CHEAP 
AND INDEED THEY WERE 
BUT EVEN THESE WERE BEYOND MY BUDGET 
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW FOR ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
EVEN SENSIBLE JAMES WAS STRUGGLING 
I WANT A REAL KOJACK SMOKIN' 
AH A REAL COOL CAR HUH YEAH 
HOW ABOUT A NINETY NINE HONDA CIVIC 
MEANWHILE 
BACK AT ADOLF'S NEGOTIATIONS ON THE CAMARO HAD BROKEN DOWN 
WELL IT'S NOT GOING WELL MATE 
I THOUGHT THAT WE'D GET HERE AND WE'D FIND 
FANTASTIC OLD AMERICAN EIGHTIES CARS FOR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS 
I KNOW I DID I THOUGHT WE'D JUST BE TRIPPING OVER OLDSMOBILE CUTLASSES 
AND FIREBIRDS YEAH 
IT'S COS WE'RE BUYING IN THAT NINETIES PERIOD WHEN THEY MADE RUBBISH I'M LOOKING AT A BUICK LE SABRE 
GOD DON'T 
IT WAS RUBBISH WHEN IT WAS NEW 
IT WAS BUILT BY IDIOTS AND IT'S RUBBISH NOW 
YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT ONE HOUR LEFT 
HAVE WE 
AND I'VE REACHED THE BOTTOM END OF THE TOWN 
I WOULDN'T HAVE THE CHINESE FOOD ROUND HERE LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY 
THE FACT WAS THOUGH IF WE WERE GOING TO FIND CARS FOR ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
WE'D HAVE TO GO TO AN EVEN LOWER BOTTOM END OF THE TOWN 
HOW MUCH MURDERING HAPPENS HERE A LOT 
IF YOU GO ONE MILE AWAY HERE YOU GO TO ANY STREET 
I'LL BE MURDERED 
YEAH EVERYBODY HERE THEY HAVE GUNS 
INCLUDING ME 
WANNA SEE 
HE'S NOT JOKING 
IT'S REAL HERE 
TWENTY FIVE 
NOW YOU SEE I WASN'T READY FOR THAT 
WELCOME TO THE UNITED STATES 
THIS IS HIS OTHER GUN 
THAT'S NOT A SHOTGUN ROBERT THAT'S A RIFLE 
RIGHT IT'S A RIFLE THE SHOTGUN IS SOMEWHERE ELSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE 
AND YOU NEED THIS IF YOU'RE GONNA BE A CAR SALESMAN 
THE GUY HERE IF YOU GO TWO BLOCKS DOWN HERE HE GOT SHOT FIVE TIMES 
WHY BY SOMEONE BUYING A CAR BUT HE KILLED THE GUY 
HE KILLED THE GUY HE KILLED THE GUY FINALLY 
SO WHY'VE YOU GOT TELESCOPIC SIGHTS ON IT 
BECAUSE IF THEY GO FAR AWAY YOU JUST SHOOT THEM 
YOU SAW THE MOVIE JOHN WAYNE THE GUY IS RUNNING ALL THE WAY 
LIKE FIVE HUNDRED FEET 
AND PSHH HE SHOOT IT RIGHT THERE 
HAMMOND 
YES JEREMY HOW ARE YOU DOING JUST BEEN TOLD BY MY NEW BEST FRIEND ROBERT THE PERSIAN 
IF YOU GO BEYOND SEVENTY NINTH STREET 
YOU WILL DEFINITELY BE MURDERED SHOT 
GOOD BYE 
HAMMOND IS WEARING COWBOY BOOTS 
THEY'RE GONNA SHOOT HIM AREN'T THEY 
IS IT SOUTH OR NORTH OF SEVENTY NINTH STREET I CAN'T GO 
I DECIDED THE BEST PLAN WAS TO STAY ON SEVENTY NINTH STREET ITSELF 
AND CAME ACROSS WHAT MUST BE THE MOST OPTIMISTIC DEALER IN TOWN 
AH WELL NEEDS MUST 
THE LESSON WE'VE LEARNED ALREADY WAS THAT IT WAS EASIER TO RENT A CAR THAN BUY ONE 
BUT WE WEREN'T GIVING UP 
BELIEVE ME I'M DESPERATE NOW DESPERATE FOR WHEELS 
DISTRESSED LOOK ON THE ROOF GUNSHOT HOLES 
THE CAR'S GOT A HISTORY 
OH NO 
IT'S GOT A TREE GROWING OUT OF IT 
THERE'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT BUT THE CAR'S RUNNING AND I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD MAKE HER AN OFFER FOR IT 
WE'VE BEEN AMBITIOUS HERE I THINK 
THIS ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A LOW AMOUNT OF MONEY 
I THEN DECIDED TO GO BEYOND THE LOWER BACK END OF TOWN 
HAVE YOU GUYS GOT ANY IDEA WHERE I CAN FIND A CAR FOR ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
YOU'VE GOT SOME GREAT TEETH HAVE YOU SEEN THESE TEETH 
YOU WANT IT TODAY IT'S GOTTA BE TODAY O. K. 
ALL RIGHT LET ME GET BACK TO YOU 
GO RIGHT AHEAD TO THE STOP SIGN GO TO THE RIGHT 
GO UP EXACTLY TWO BLOCKS 
WHAT THIS WAY YEAH 
AMAZINGLY THE TIP PAID OFF AND I WAS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE 
AT OUR PRE ARRANGED MEETING POINT 
THE MIAMI JAI ALAI STADIUM 
THIS 
IS A CHEVROLET CAMARO THE R. S. MODEL 
FIVE L. V. EIGHT ENGINE 
FIVE SPEED GEARBOX REAR WHEEL DRIVE A FULL ON AMERICAN MUSCLE CAR 
ONLY THREE PREVIOUS MURDERERS 
AND I ONLY PAID EIGHT HUNDRED FOR IT 
THEN HAMMOND TURNED UP 
OH DEAR 
HE'S NEVER BEEN TO AMERICA BEFORE AND NOW HE'S BOUGHT HIMSELF 
WHAT HE THINKS ALL AMERICANS HAVE THAT IS BLUFF 
WHADDYA THINK 
I WELL 
IT'S A DODGE RAM IT'S TERRIBLE 
A DENT THERE'S A FEW DENTS AND BITS MISSING IT'S BASIC IT'S BASIC MOTORING AT ITS VERY BEST 
YOU KNOW HOW A MERCEDES GOES 
YEAH 
NOT A MERCEDES IT'S NOT A MERCEDES 
HOW MUCH 
ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
THAT SHUTS ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS YES 
EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS I'M ALREADY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AHEAD OF YOU 
EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS 
THE R. S. MODEL 
WAS THAT THE BASIC ONE 
COURSE IT WASN'T THE BASIC ONE R. S. IS RALLY SPORT 
I'D ASK JAMES ON THAT ONE WHEN HE ARRIVES BUT I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE IT WAS 
THERE WAS THE R. S. THE I. R. O. C. Z. 
I'LL KEEP QUIET ABOUT THAT 
BUT NO EVERY SINGLE THING ON IT WORKS 
NEARLY 
OH IT'S A MANUAL FIVE ON THE FLOOR REAR WHEEL DRIVE I'VE GOT A MUSCLE CAR HOW MANY HORSEPOWER 
TWO HUNDRED AND OH RUBBISH ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY 
ONE HUNDRED NINETY HOW DO THEY GET SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF HORSEPOWER FROM A CAR 
THE MORE PRESSING QUESTION THOUGH WAS WHERE WAS JAMES 
HE'LL HAVE WALKED INTO A DEALERSHIP AND THEY'LL HAVE SHOT HIM 
HELLO 
HOW CAN HE TAKE SO LONG 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE DOES 
I MEAN HE'LL BE LOST 
GOOD GRIEF IS THAT HIM 
IT'S A TRAIN 
THAT'S THE TITANIC I'VE CHANGED MY MIND IT'S AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER 
THAT'S REALLY BIG 
THAT GENTLEMEN IS HOW YOU DO IT 
THAT'S A NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE CADILLAC BROUGHAM SEDAN 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WELL IT'S TERRIBLE 
IT'S LIKE A LONG WALK ROUND IT IT'S A REALLY LONG WALK 
I LIKE THAT THOUGH 
IT DOESN'T JUST MOVE UP AND DOWN LOOK IT GOES FROM SIDE TO SIDE 
HAVE YOU SEEN THE ROADS ROUND HERE THAT IS A PERFECT CAR FOR THE ENVIRONMENT NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS 
AND YOU CAN SEE WHY 
WELL DON'T DO THAT MATE OH 
IT'S GOT NEWSPAPER IN IT YOU CAN DATE IT FIND OUT WHEN IT WAS REPAIRED IT WAS A WEDNESDAY 
WHAT SIZE ENGINE HAS THIS THING GOT FIVE L. V. EIGHT 
IT'S NOT FAST YOU DON'T SAY 
IS IT NOT MATE I TOOK ONE LOOK AND THOUGHT IT'S LIKE A LOTUS EXIGE 
JAMES THEN TURNED ON OUR CARS 
THE WHEELS ARE ODD NO I'VE GOT AN ALLOY THAT'S MY ALLOY 
CHECK OUT MY ALLOY 
THIS HAS JUST BEEN MADE OUT OF BITS IT HASN'T 
AH NO AH 
IT SMELLS OF BODIES 
OOH IT DOES SMELL A BIT RIPE HOLD ON 
EURR IT'S THE CLOTHES OF THE LAST PERSON THEY KILLED 
IT IS 
OH MY 
OH GOD NO 
THAT'S THE LAST PERSON THE DRIVER KILLED 
DON'T LOOK 
THE POOR MAN WAS TRYING TO GET OUT 
JAMES AND I BOUGHT CARS YES 
YOU'VE BOUGHT A PICK UP TRUCK 
THE REASON YOURS IS IN BETTER CONDITION IS IT'S JUST A PICK UP TRUCK 
IT'S LOVELY I'M DELIGHTED WITH IT I QUITE LIKE THE PICK UP TRUCK COMPARED TO THE CAMARO 
WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE THE CAMARO 
I'M SORRY I DON'T WELL I DO ONE OF THOSE IN GOOD NICK YES 
YOURS IS A DOG 
IT ISN'T IT JEREMY 
BUT EVERY ONE OF US HAS GOT SOMETHING BETTER THAN YOU GET FROM A RENTAL DESK WELL YEAH 
TO FIND OUT HOW GOOD OUR CARS WERE WE WERE TOLD TO HEAD TO A RACETRACK NINETY MILES NORTH OF MIAMI 
THERE WE'D BE GIVEN A SERIES OF CHALLENGES 
I'M IN A MURDERER'S MUSCLE CAR HEADING THROUGH MIAMI 
YES THIS IS BRILLIANT 
I LOVE PICK UP TRUCKS 
IT'S A CADILLAC 
I'M ABSOLUTELY STAGGERED 
I'VE EVEN GOT A FUNCTIONING RADIO 
ALTHOUGH THERE'S ONLY ONE STATION IT'LL PICK UP WHICH IS GOSPEL READY 
YES I AGREE WITH YOU 
'. I AM BLESSED 
TEMPERATURES ARE A BIG DEAL WE'RE WELL INTO THE NINETIES AND EVEN ONE HUNDREDS 
THE MONO RADIO STATION HOWEVER WAS THE TIP OF AN ICEBERG 
IF I'M HONEST THERE ARE ONE OR TWO ISSUES 
WITH MY CAMARO 
ER THE REV COUNTER FOR EXAMPLE BROKEN 
THEN THERE'S AN ALARMING KNOCKING NOISE FROM THE FRONT SUSPENSION 
WHEN YOU GO OVER A BUMP 
OR WHEN YOU'RE ON FULL LOCK 
THE OTHERS TOO WERE FINDING PROBLEMS 
NOW WE'RE ALONE VIEWERS I CAN ADMIT TO ONE OR TWO VERY SMALL FAULTS WITH MY CADILLAC 
THE FIRST IS THE SQUEAK A LOOSE BELT OR BEARING OR SOMETHING 
THE OTHER IT IS FANTASTICALLY SLOW THIS THING 
I'M DOING FIFTY FIVE AND I'M PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN AND I'M REALLY STRUGGLING TO GET IT UP TO SIXTY 
IF I'M HONEST 
IT DOES PULL A LITTLE BIT TO THE RIGHT 
AND IF I BRAKE IT PULLS TO THE LEFT REALLY BADLY 
I'M RIGHT BEHIND RICHARD HAMMOND'S DODGE RAM AND I'VE JUST NOTICED THAT THE BODY DOESN'T LINE UP 
HANG ON 
WITH THE WHEELS QUITE RIGHT 
BUT THE WORST PROBLEM BY A MILE IS THE AIR CONDITIONING 
WHICH AS YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE FROM THE STATE OF MY SHIRT 
IS BROKEN 
NINETY TWO PER CENT HUMIDITY AND NO AIR CON 
THE ONLY CONSOLATION I HAVE IS THAT HAMMOND'S AIR CONDITIONING 
DOESN'T WORK EITHER 
APART FROM THE AIR CONDITIONING NOT WORKING IT'S PRETTY MUCH PERFECT 
FOR THE FIRST TIME I'VE GOT A RADIO ON ONE OF THESE TRIPS 
BUT ENOUGH OF THE CARS' LITTLE FOIBLES 
IT WAS TIME TO SETTLE DOWN AND ENJOY OUR JOURNEY ACROSS THE SUNSHINE STATE 
GOD FLORIDA'S AWFUL 
NASTY INSECTS 
OLD PEOPLE FAT PEOPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ALL OFFER YOU CHEESE 
YOU WANT CHEESE WITH THAT YOU WANT CHEESE WITH THAT 
AND THEN SHOOT YOU 
GOING WHERE THE WEATHER SUITS MY CLOTHES 
WHILE HAMMOND ROASTED JAMES REMAINED SMUG AND COOL 
IT'S GETTING A BIT PARKY ACTUALLY 
I'LL JUST TURN THE TEMPERATURE UP VERY SLIGHTLY 
LOOK I'M BURT REYNOLDS 
I'M THE BANDIT 
ARGH 
EVENTUALLY WE TURNED OFF THE HIGHWAY 
AND ARRIVED AT THE RACETRACK 
THE MOROSO MOTORSPORTS PARK IS UNUSUAL IN AMERICA 
BECAUSE IT HAS LEFT HANDED TURNS AND SOME WHICH GO RIGHT AS WELL 
PERHAPS THAT'S WHY IT WAS DESERTED TOO COMPLICATED FOR THE COLONIALS 
OR MAYBE EVERYONE HAD BEEN MURDERED 
WHATEVER IT WAS TIME FOR OUR FIRST CHALLENGE 
IT SAYS THAT EACH OF OUR CARS MUST COMPLETE ONE LAP OF THE TRACK THE TARGET IS ONE MINUTE TEN SECONDS 
GET POINTS FOR EVERY SECOND UNDER THAT TIME LOSE POINTS FOR EVERY SECOND OVER IT 
BUT NONE OF US HAVE SEEN THAT TRACK YES THAT'S GONNA BE TRICKY 
YOU'RE NOT DRIVING 
WHO IS SOME SAY THAT HE'S A C. I. A. EXPERIMENT THAT WENT WRONG 
AND THAT HE ONLY EATS CHEESE 
ALL WE KNOW IS HE'S NOT THE STIG 
BUT HE IS THE STIG'S AMERICAN COUSIN 
OOH 
BIG STIG 
FIRST HE SQUEEZED HIMSELF INTO MY CAMARO 
ONE TWO THREE 
GO 
I WAS EXPECTING A. R. A. R. A. R. A. R. AW 
IT'S ZERO TO SIXTY IN SEVENTY NINE SECONDS YEAH ONCE 
IT CAN DO ONE HUNDRED TEN AND HE'S DOING THAT NOW AND NO MORE 
IT'S LIMITED IT'S ELECTRONICALLY LIMITED 
NO IT'S JUST NATURALLY LIMITED TO ONE HUNDRED TEN COS IT'S RUBBISH 
LEAN THAT WEIGHT IN THERE BIG STIG 
THERE HE GOES ONE MINUTE NINE SECONDS ON OUR TOP STOPWATCH 
IS THAT GOOD WE DON'T KNOW DO WE 
WHAT WE DID KNOW WAS THAT THE PIMP MOBILE WAS NEXT 
I'M GOING TO NEED A CALENDAR FOR THIS NOT A STOPWATCH 
HAVE YOU GOT A DIARY 
I'LL HOLD THIS STONE AND AS IT'S ERODED BY THE WIND THAT'LL GIVE US AN IDEA OF HOW LONG IT'S BEEN 
AIR CON MAX 
OH COCK 
IT'S BROKEN ISN'T IT MATE IT'S RUN OUT OF ELECTRICITY TO RAISE THE TITANIC 
WE BORROWED A BATTERY BOOSTER 
IS THAT FOR STARTING YOUR WATCH WHEN IT STOPS 
THAT'S JUST 
OH IT'S BEGUN 
ONE TWO THREE 
GO 
IT'S MOVED OFF 
IT'S STILL MOVING OFF 
I AM A LINEMAN FOR THE COUNTY 
AND I DRIVE THE MAIN ROAD 
TWENTY FOUR DAYS SEARCHING IN THE SUN FOR ANOTHER 
I'M GETTING OLDER 
OVERLOAD AND I NEED YOU MORE 
IT LOOKS FABULOUS COME ON ADMIT IT WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME TO ADMIRE IT 
AND I WANT YOU FOR ALL TIME 
THE CADILLAC CERTAINLY SEEMED TO SUIT BIG STIG'S RELAXED DRIVING STYLE 
WICHITA LINEMAN 
ON THE GRASS BUT WOULD THE MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN BE ABLE TO BEAT THE CAMARO'S 
ONE MINUTE NINE 
YAY GO ON 
ONE MINUTE FOURTEEN 
SO NOW IT WAS ALL DOWN TO HAMMOND'S HILLBILLY MOBILE 
THREE TWO ONE GO 
IS THAT A MANUAL FOUR ON THE FLOOR WITH OVERDRIVE 
ACTUALLY IT ALL LOOKED PRETTY PROMISING 
IF THIS BEATS MINE I'LL HAVE TO KILL YOU I AM IN THE CAMARO SO DON'T THINK I WON'T 
OH IT'S A PROUD AND NOBLE THING 
YOU SAW BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN AND THOUGHT I WANT A PIECE OF THAT LIFE 
NOT THAT PIECE I'LL HAVE THE TRUCK 
ALTHOUGH THE TRUCK HAD STARTED WELL 
IN THE LAST FEW TIGHT CORNERS IT WAS RUBBISH 
HAVE YOU SEEN HOW MY ALLOY GLINTS IN THE SUN 
WHAT WERE YOU ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN YEP 
NO IT CAN'T 
TWELVE THIRTEEN ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN NOOOOOO 
HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN ONE SIXTEEN POINT NINE 
THAT'S MORE TO DO WITH THE STIG BEING TOO BIG 
HE DIDN'T MAKE THE TURN 
FAT STIG'S WORK WAS DONE 
AND SO IT WAS TIME FOR THE NEXT CHALLENGE 
YOU MUST EACH ACCELERATE YOUR CAR TO FIFTY M. P. H. WHEN YOU REACH FIFTY M. P. H. 
YOU MUST BRAKE AS HARD AS YOU CAN 
SO THIS IS A TEST OF ACCELERATION AND BRAKING ALL TOGETHER YES 
YOU MUST BRAKE BEFORE THE END OF THE TRACK 
AT THE END OF THE TRACK THERE IS A RIVER 
THAT'S NO BIG DEAL 
FULL OF ALLIGATORS 
AND THAT WASN'T A MISPRINT 
I SHOULD EXPLAIN THAT IS THE TRACK SO IF YOU LOOK UP THERE O. K. THERE IT IS 
O. K. AND HERE THIS IS ALLIGATOR INFESTED 
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE 
WE DREW HOTDOGS AND MINE WAS THE SHORTEST 
I HOPE HE DOESN'T DIE AT THE END 
IT'S SALTWATER CROCODILES YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT 
I THINK 
I HOPE HE DOESN'T GO IN THE RIVER THAT'D BE AWFUL HERE WE GO 
THE HELL WITH THE CLUTCH 
SPIRITED START 
COME ON THIRTY I DON'T WANT TO BE EATEN BY AN ALLIGATOR THIRTY FIVE 
FORTY 
FORTY FIVE 
IT'S FIFTY 
THAT'S DOUBLY DISAPPOINTING 
NUMBER ONE HE'S NOT DEAD YEP AND NUMBER TWO 
THE FASTEST ACCELERATING CAR HERE ONLY JUST STOPPED BEFORE THE GRASS 
SURELY THOUGH THE HUGGY BEAR MOBILE 
WOULD STRUGGLE TO DO ZERO TO FIFTY TO ZERO IN THE DISTANCE 
WHOA HOO 
THAT IS MOVEMENT COME ON CAR 
COME ON COME ON COME ON 
NEARLY THERE 
BRAKE 
STREWTH THAT HAD ME WORRIED 
I SHOULD IMAGINE HE'S CLENCHED IN THERE 
EIGHT TONS OF CADDY 
I WAS REALLY NERVOUS 
I'D JUST SEEN BIG STIG TRY TO STOP MY TRUCK AND FAIL COMPLETELY 
WE'RE AWAY THAT'S TWENTY 
HERE HE COMES TO A CERTAIN DEATH 
FORTY 
FORTY FIVE IT TAKES AGES 
OH MY GOD OH GOD 
OH 
THAT IS QUITE FUNNY 
HAMMOND 
ARE YOU ALIVE ALLIGATORS MATE 
YEAH 
CAN I SUGGEST WE MAY HAVE MADE THEM ANGRY 
I'VE JUST DRIVEN INTO THEIR LIVING ROOM 
SUCH AN INSUFFERABLE OAF 
ARGH THERE'S MY PICK UP LOOK 
THE CARS HAD SURVIVED THEIR ORDEAL BY TRACK JUST 
BUT THE NEXT MORNING THE REAL TEST BEGAN 
A SWELTERING EIGHT HUNDRED MILE ROAD TRIP TO NEW ORLEANS 
TODAY PARTLY CLOUDY HIGHS IN THE LOWER NINETIES CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS THIRTY PER CENT 
THINGS STARTED BADLY 
HAS IT GOT PETROL IN IT 
YEAH LOOK IT'S FULL 
WELL YEAH BUT HAS IT GOT PETROL IN IT IT COULD BE BROKEN 
WHEN DID YOU LAST PUT PETROL IN IT UM 
MIAMI 
NOW YOU COME TO MENTION IT 
YOU STUPID MAN 
IT'S A FIVE L. V. EIGHT 
AHEM THE CAR IS FINE 
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS 
MINE'S RUN OUT OF ELECTRICITY AGAIN 
YOU'RE JOKING 
CAN I BORROW YOUR VAN AND YOUR JUMP LEADS 
SEE HOW PREPARED WE ARE ON THIS SHOW 
YOU HAD THE ER LEADS IN YOUR CAR 
NO NO YOU HAD THE LEADS 
I'M NOT A STUPID MAN 
I'VE GOT A DOOR PANEL SOME BOLTS AND THAT'S IT 
WHAT'S THE MATTER 
HE'S LOST THE JUMP LEADS HE'S LOST THE JUMP LEADS HE'S LOST THE JUMP LEADS THIS ISN'T GOING WELL IS IT 
IF YOU'RE THINKING OF COMING TO AMERICA 
THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GOT YOUR COMFORT INN YOUR BEST WESTERN YOUR RED LOBSTER WHERE YOU EAT 
EVERYBODY'S VERY FAT EVERYBODY'S VERY STUPID AND EVERYBODY'S VERY RUDE 
IT'S NOT THE HOLIDAY PROGRAMME IT'S THE TRUTH 
EVENTUALLY THE LEADS WERE FOUND 
AND HAMMOND POSITIONED HIMSELF FOR THE JUMP START 
NO IT'S NOT FUNNY 
WE'RE OFF 
I'M SWEATING ALREADY 
IT'S NOT A SUNNY DAY 
IT'S JUST A HUMID DAY TODAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS 
TROPICAL 
NO THAT'S THE APPROACH OF A COLD FRONT 
THAT'S TALL CUMULONIMBUS WITH A HIGH 
IT'S BIGGER THAN YOU EXPECT 
YOU DON'T REALISE 
I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHAT HAMMOND THINKS HE LOOKS LIKE CHEWING GUM 
HIS AVIATORS HIS COWBOY HAT AND HIS PICK UP TRUCK 
TO HELP RELIEVE THE TEDIUM OF THE JOURNEY THE PRODUCTION OFFICE HAD PROVIDED US 
WITH C. B. RADIOS 
AND FOR THOSE WE NEEDED APPROPRIATE CALL SIGNS 
BROKEBACK BROKEBACK THIS IS MURDERER 
THIS IS BROKEBACK TO MURDERER AND THE CAPTAIN 
I WONDER WHY THESE C. B. RADIOS NEVER CAUGHT ON 
BREAKER BREAKER ONE NINE CONTACT EYEBALL TEN TEN TILL WE DO IT AGAIN CAPTAIN SLOW 
HE'S THERE HE'S THERE AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HIM 
THIS WAS HOPELESS SO WE CHANGED CHANNELS 
HELLO I'M ON TWENTY TWO ARE YOU THERE 
YO BIG BOY 
AND FINALLY MADE CONTACT WITH A NATIVE 
THAT'S HIM IN THAT TRUCK 
HE'S ASKING 
ALL THEY'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT ON THAT C. B. IS THE WEATHER AND PROSTITUTES 
YEAH IT'S RAINING I'M GOING NORTH AND I'M LOOKING FOR A WHORE 
AS WE HEADED NORTH WEST THE HEAT AND HUMIDITY BECAME UNBEARABLE 
YOU'RE SITTING THERE IN THE WINTER 
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IN AN UN AIR CONDITIONED CAR IN FLORIDA NOW 
IT'S SO HOT 
DANGER PERSISTS IN THE HOT WEST EVEN THOUGH ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE FIRE IS CONTAINED 
MUCH OF IT IS STILL BURNING OUT OF CONTROL 
ONLY THE INSUFFERABLE MAY WASN'T SUFFERING 
HEY CHAPS IT'S ME HERE 
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THAT MY AIR CONDITIONING IS WORKING VERY NICELY IT'S SIXTY FIVE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT 
YES ALL RIGHT 
BUT THEN THE SMILE WAS WIPED FROM HIS FACE 
AGAIN 
ANY CHARGE LEFT IN IT 
I'VE BROUGHT YOU SOME PRESENTS 
I'VE GOT YOU A STEAK AND CHEESE BISCUIT WHAT 
AND I'VE BOUGHT YOU A FAN 
REALLY YEAH WE'VE GOT FANS THAT'S FANTASTIC MATE 
HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW YEAH AIR CON THERE IT IS 
OOH EUGH EUGH 
SEE WHAT I'VE GOT HAM AND CHEESE 
YES DUNDEE HAM AND CHEESE I'LL READ YOU THE INGREDIENTS BLAH BLAH BLAH AND 
IMITATION AMERICAN CHEESE SO IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT HASN'T GOT ANY CHEESE ON YES 
AFTER OUR IMITATION AMERICAN LUNCH 
IT WAS MY TURN TO HELP THE STRICKEN CADILLAC 
OH YES 
OH BACK IN THE SWEAT BOX 
INTENSIVE HEAT WARNINGS CONTINUING 
NOW WHAT THAT IS DOING IT'S JUST TURBO CHARGING WARM AIR INTO MY FACE 
THAT'S GOT 
NICE ONE 
JEREMY THIS IS BROKEBACK 
DID YOU CUT THE WIRE 
YOU WANT YOUR MAN TO LOOK GOOD BUT WORDS LIKE EXFOLIANT SCARE HIM 
THE MILES PASSED WITH THE CADILLAC ENDLESSLY BREAKING DOWN 
NO 
HAVE YOU GOT THE LEADS NO YOU HAVE 
STILL THANKS TO THE AUTOMATIC WINDSCREEN WASHERS AT FLORIDA SERVICE STATIONS 
OH NO 
HAMMOND AND I COULD AT LEAST ENJOY SOME REFRESHING SHOWERS WHILE WE GOT IT GOING AGAIN 
OH 
THE CADILLAC HOWEVER WAS NOT THE ONLY TROUBLE MAKER 
AFTER JUST TWO HUNDRED MILES MY CAMARO WAS HARDLY TIPTOP EITHER 
SOME OF THE HEADLIGHTS ARE WORKING THE DASHBOARD'S COME OFF 
ALL THE DIALS ARE BROKEN 
ONE RADIO SPEAKER REMAINS HOWEVER AND IT'S GOOD 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WITH GOD'S HELP WE CAN STOP GLOBAL WARMING 
IN A WORLD WHERE TAILS STOP WAGGING STICKS DON'T GET FETCHED 
AND CHEW TOYS STAY DRY ONE MAN DARES TO STEP FORWARD AND DECLARE 
I CAN GET TO THE ROOT OF YOUR DOG'S DEPRESSION 
EVENTUALLY OUR TOP GEAR FLY DRIVE HOLIDAY COMBO 
REACHED THE THREE HUNDRED MILE MARK 
AS A REWARD THE PRODUCTION OFFICE GAVE EACH OF US ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO BUY AN ACCESSORY 
THAT MIGHT IN SOME WAY MAKE OUR JOURNEY LESS ARDUOUS 
HOPING AND PRAYING THAT JAMES 
HAD BOUGHT A NEW BATTERY FOR HIS STUPID CADILLAC 
WE ALL MET UP TO SHOW OFF OUR NEW TOYS 
A TRAILER NOPE THE FREEDOM GRILL FIVE HUNDRED A GRILLING SYSTEM IT'S A GRILLING SYSTEM 
WHAT IS IT 
I HAVE BEEN NO NO WAY 
LOOK AT THAT 
DROP TAILGATE COOKING PLATFORM WHADDYA THINK 
GORDON RAMSAY HASN'T GOT ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN HIS KITCHEN 
HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING THAT GOOD JAMES 
NO RIGHT 
I GOT A CLOTHES RACK WHAT 
LOOK AT MY PERFECTLY PRESSED LINEN JACKET HE HAS A LINEN JACKET 
O. K. SO YOU STEP INTO YOUR CAR AND HERE IF YOU LOOK 
IS A SHOWER 
IN YOUR CAR YUP 
WHERE WILL YOU GET THE WATER FROM THEN 
IT COMES FROM THE COOL BOX IN THE BACK THIS TUBE 
THEN YOU JUST PLUG THIS INTO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER HIT THAT BUTTON 
REFRESHING SHOWER 
I BET YOU'RE JEALOUS 
SADLY THOUGH OUR DREAMS OF LUXURY LIVING 
WERE SHATTERED WHEN WE RECEIVED THE NEXT CHALLENGE 
TONIGHT YOU WILL BE CAMPING OH WHAT I KNOW 
AND YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO EAT 
WHAT YOU FIND DEAD AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
WHAT YOU MEAN ROADKILL 
SO THAT'S ANIMALS THAT WE FIND BY THE ROAD DEAD YEAH THAT'S OUR SUPPER 
JUST THINK ABOUT IT 
YOU CAN PREPARE THE FOOD WASH IT I CAN THEN COOK IT 
JAMES CAN DRESS FOR DINNER 
POTATOES TOMATOES IT'S HARD TO KNOW I CAN SEE THAT 
SO LET ME ASK YOU HOW HIGH SHOULD A PINEAPPLE BOUNCE WHEN IT'S RIPE 
O. K. SIT REP 
THE POWER STEERING PUMP REALLY IS ON ITS LAST LEGS 
I'VE GOT A TERRIBLE WHEEL WOBBLE 
ER BUT I'M COOL FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE I SET OFF 
I AM COOL NOW 
TO INCREASE OUR CHANCES OF FINDING SOME ROADKILL WE SWAPPED THE INTERSTATE 
FOR S. M. A. LLER ROADS 
AND VERY QUICKLY WE GOT LUCKY 
ON THE RIGHT WHAT'S THAT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T FANCY IT 
NO MATTER THOUGH BECAUSE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD I CAME ACROSS A FRESH TASTY POSSUM 
BUT THEN 
JAMES DON'T RUN OVER IT YOU YOU BLITHERING IDIOT 
YOU'VE JUST RUN OVER IT 
THAT'S NOT EDIBLE NOW IS IT 
FOR FLATTENING OUR SUPPER 
JAMES WAS PUNISHED 
EVENTUALLY WE DID FIND FRESH MEAT 
BUT IT WAS A BIT TOO FRESH 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA RUN IT OVER EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON EURGH DON'T DO THAT TORTOISE 
HOW CAN YOU HAVE THERE ARE NO WILD TORTOISES THEY'VE GOTTA BE SOMEWHERE 
IT'S ESCAPED FROM SOME EIGHT YEAR OLD GIRL HOW DOES A TORTOISE ESCAPE COME BACK 
FINALLY THOUGH TEN MILES DOWN THE ROAD WE'VE GOT DINNER 
SQUIRREL CHECK THAT OUT 
I THINK THAT WITH A BIT OF CHEESE WILL BE DELICIOUS 
RIGHT 
LOOK AT MAY'S FACE 
I NEVER TOLD YOU ABOUT MY VEGETARIANISM DID I 
SOON WE WERE NEAR THE FIELD WHERE WE WOULD BE CAMPING FOR THE NIGHT 
RIGHT NOW THE SUN'S GOING DOWN 
I'M WITH MY MATES 
IT'S DOWN BELOW NINETY DEGREES WE'RE IN THE DEEP SOUTH 
IT'S A PLEASANT EVENING THIS IS NICE 
BUT WE STILL ONLY HAD A SQUIRREL FOR DINNER 
SO I PEELED OFF FOR ONE LAST FORAGE WHILE THE OTHERS WENT AHEAD TO SET UP CAMP 
SORRY 
RIGHT WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO 
I'M THINKING SQUIRREL ON THE RACK 
AND THEN MAYBE HERE'S MY PLAN 
WITH A FEW HERBS GARNISHED SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
UM I'M THINKING IF I COOK IT ONCE 
AND THEN MAYBE COOK IT AGAIN SO IT'LL GO LIKE CRISPY DUCK ONLY IT'S A SQUIRREL 
IS HE EVER COMING BACK 
WE CAN'T JUST LOB IT ON CAN WE 
WITH RABBIT YOU TAKE THE HEAD OFF YOU GO DOWN THE MIDDLE BUT ALL WE HAVE TO DO IT WITH 
IS A TENT PEG DIDN'T YOU BRING A PENKNIFE 
NO 
TIME PASSED AND STILL NO SIGN OF JEREMY 
I'M NOT PEELING IT MATE I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULD DO IT 
COME ON I DON'T WANT TO PEEL A SQUIRREL I'LL BRING IT OVER 
IS THAT A CAR IS IT JEZZA 
JAMES 
WHAT'S HE GOT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS 
THAT'S 
WHAT 
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE 
IT'S A FLAMING COW MATE 
MAIN COURSE YEAH I'M THINKING HOW LONG I'VE BEEN IN THAT SUN PUTTING THE TENT UP WHY 
BECAUSE WHAT I'M SEEING YOU'LL LOVE THIS 
IS A COW ON THE ROOF OF YOUR CAMARO IT IS A COW ON THERE IT IS 
I DON'T WANT TO BE PEDANTIC BUT IS IT ROADKILL 
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING I RAN IT DOWN 
WELL CHECK OUT THE FRONT OF MY CAR 
SOMEONE HELPED ME GET IT ON THERE BUT I DIDN'T RUN IT DOWN 
IT WAS AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD NOW IT'S ON THE ROOF AND IT'S OUR SUPPER 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT WELL YOU'VE GOT TO PEEL IT 
I'M NOT PEELING THAT 
FIRST THOUGH WE HAD TO GET IT OFF THE ROOF 
WHAT IF I GO ROUND A CORNER QUITE QUICKLY BACKWARDS 
UM LEFT HAND DOWN YES IF I REVERSE LEFT HAND DOWN IT'LL ROLL OVER THAT WAY DO WE THINK 
I RECKON SHE'S GOOD TO GO 
YES THERE YOU GO 
HEY JEREMY WHAT I'M BETTER I CAN'T SEE A COW ON THE ROOF OF YOUR CAMARO ANY MORE 
I'M NOT HUNGRY WHAT 
I'M NOT HUNGRY 
YOU 
IT STINKS JEREMY 
THAT NIGHT BROKEBACK AND I FEASTED ON BEEF AND SQUIRREL 
AND THEN WITH MAY IN BED 
WE DECIDED IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ALL OF US 
IF THE AIR CONDITIONING IN HIS CAR WERE TO BREAK 
SHH O. K. 
SORRY 
WHY DON'T WE JUST HIT IT WITH A HAMMER 
HOLD ON 
OH HANG ON HANG ON 
THEY REALLY BUILT THESE OLD BUSES IT'S RIDICULOUS 
OH I'M JUST HITTING IT WITH A SPATULA 
ANOTHER MOSQUITO JUST BIT MY FACE 
IT'S NOT WORKING 
HE'S GONNA NOTICE ISN'T HE 
ANOTHER HUMID DAY DAWNED AND NOW MAY KNEW WHAT IT FELT LIKE 
THOSE PATHETIC 
LAGER SWILLING BARBECUING REDNECK THUGS THAT I CALL MY CO PRESENTERS 
HAVE VANDALISED MY CAR 
I HAVE HAD TO MAKE A FEW MODIFICATIONS 
TO THE CAR THIS MORNING 
BECAUSE OF THE COW INCIDENT I LOST THE AERIAL 
SO NOW I'VE GOT AN ISTATION INSTEAD 
AND THAT TEAMED WITH THE FAN MEANS I REALLY CAN'T SEE WHERE I'M GOING 
ALSO BECAUSE SOME COW DID GET INTO THE CAR I'M USING AIR FRESHENERS HERE TO COVER UP THE SMELL 
SO I CAN'T REALLY SEE WHERE I'VE BEEN 
OH AND UM THE PASSENGER SEAT 
THAT GOT A LOT OF COW JUICE ON IT 
SO IT'S NOW IN THE BACK OF HAMMOND'S TRUCK 
BY THIS AFTERNOON SKIES WILL BE CONSIDERABLY CLOUDY WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LIKELY 
NORTH EAST WINDS FIVE TO TEN M. P. H. 
COME ON 
ALABAMA'S ONLY FORTY MILES NOW 
OUR SCRAP YARD CARS HAVE COVERED SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILES AND INEVITABLY 
THEY WERE BECOMING MORE THAN JUST METAL 
THIS WHOLE THING NOW REALLY SUMS UP WHY I LOVE CARS 
TAKE THIS CAMARO 
THE DASH IS MORE PLASTIC THAN AN AMERICAN NEWSREADER 
THE ENGINE'S GOT LESS POWER THEN BELGIUM 
THE SUSPENSION IS SOFTER THAN THE JOURNALISM IN AN IN FLIGHT MAGAZINE 
AND OF COURSE IT REEKS OF COW 
BUT I ADORE IT 
BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST SENSE IT WANTS TO KEEP GOING 
AND I BET JAMES IS EXACTLY THE SAME THERE IN THE CADILLAC 
I BET HE'S HAVING EXACTLY THE SAME EMOTIONS 
I'D RATHER BE IN THIS NOW THAN AN ENZO 
AND I'M NOT JOKING 
BUT BEFORE WE ENTERED ALABAMA 
WE HAD TO GO TO BAGDAD FOR OUR NEXT CHALLENGE 
THIS IS IT 
WE ARE IN BAGDAD 
NOT A PLACE I WAS EXPECTING TO VISIT ON THIS TRIP 
CHALLENGE TIME 
LOSE FIVE L. B. S. IN ONE HOUR 
YEP SWEAT IT AWAY COME ON THEN 
NO 
O. K. IT SAYS HERE WE MUST NOT BE SHOT OR ARRESTED AS WE DRIVE ACROSS THE PROUD STATE OF ALABAMA 
BUT WE WILL GET BONUS POINTS IF WE CAN GET ONE OF THE OTHERS SHOT OR ARRESTED 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW DO WE DO THAT 
YOU WILL THEREFORE DECORATE ONE ANOTHER'S CARS IN SUCH A WAY 
TO DRAW MAXIMUM ATTENTION TO YOURSELF 
IN THIS BIBLE BASHING REDNECK DEEPLY CHRISTIAN PART OF THE UNION 
DECORATE I THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS WE EACH HAVE TO WRITE SLOGANS 
ON THE OTHER CARS SO YOU TO GET THEM KILLED YEAH 
ALL RIGHT SO YOU DO HAMMOND'S 
YOU DO I'M DOING YOURS I'M GETTING YOU KILLED WELL COME ON 
THE SOUTH THE SOUTH IT'S CHRISTIAN SHORT HAIR 
THEY DON'T LIKE COMMUNISTS 
WHAT IS CLOSEST TO THEIR HEART I'VE GOT TO GET HIM KILLED THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY 
I'D BE LETTING YOU DOWN ME DOWN EVERYBODY DOWN HE HE HE 
REVENGE FOR ALL THOSE HEIGHT GAGS EVERY TIME HE'S CALLED ME HAMSTER 
THIS IS FOR EVERY TIME YOU'VE BEEN LATE AND LOST 
CAN YOU TELL WHAT IT SAYS YET 
JAMES I HATE YOU FOR THAT I REALLY HATE YOU FOR THAT 
ALL THE TIMES YOU DROVE INTO THE BACK OF MY CADILLAC YEAH 
DO YOU KNOW HONESTLY I THINK WE'VE ALL DONE A GOOD JOB HERE 
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE PERSON MOST LIKELY TO BE SHOT 
IS INDEED HAMMOND 
SIMPLE I THINK WHAT YOU'VE DONE THERE IS KILLED YOUR FRIEND YEAH 
GINGERLY WE REJOINED THE OPEN ROAD 
THREE RELIGIONS DOWN HERE GEORGE BUSH GOD COUNTRY AND WESTERN 
IN THAT ORDER 
ASCENDING ORDER 
I'LL BE HONEST 
I HAVE FELT LESS CONSPICUOUS THAN THIS 
HERE WE ARE SWEET HOME ALABAMA 
IMITATES GUNFIRE 
THEY'VE SHOT THEIR OWN SIGN 
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO TO US 
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT JEREMY'S DONE TO MY CAR YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS DEEP REPUBLICAN TERRITORY 
THAT WOMAN IS THE ARCH DEMOCRAT SHE IS THE ANTICHRIST 
IT'S NOT JUST THE SLOGAN 
IT'S THE FACT THAT IT'S PAINTED ON A PICK UP 
SYMBOL OF THE SOUTH 
I MEAN 
OOH 
AND THEN JEREMY HAS WRITTEN ON THE BOOT NASCAR SUCKS 
NOW THAT'S A TYPE OF SALOON CAR RACING 
THAT IS VERY BIG IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD 
THIS IS WHERE THE DRIVERS COME FROM ALL THE BUILDING OF THE CARS IS DONE 
ALL THE SUPPORTERS COME FROM HERE AND TO SAY IT SUCKS 
IS A BIT LIKE GOING UP AND PUNCHING SOMEBODY'S SAINTED MOTHER 
NO NO 
WHOA 
WE'D SURVIVED THE HIGHWAY BUT THEN WE HAD TO PULL INTO A TOWN FOR FUEL 
OH THIS IS 
REALLY TERRIFYING 
O. K. 
JUST UM 
THAT'S DIESEL 
THAT'S I'VE GONE 
HILLARY FOR PRESIDENT THAT'S NOT GOING DOWN WELL 
THIS LADY WAS CROSS BUT NOT AS CROSS 
AS THE GARAGE'S OWNER 
YOU 
NOW ARE Y'ALL GAY LOOKING TO SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET BEAT UP IN A HICK TOWN 
I'M NOT GAY I'M MARRIED 
I'VE GOT THREE CHILDREN 
ER NO WE'RE NOT NO 
WE'VE JUST SORT OF DECORATED OUR CARS IN A DISTINCTIVE MANNER 
NASCAR SUCKS COUNTRY AND WESTERN IS RUBBISH 
GUESS WHAT YOU'RE IN A HICK TOWN MAN 
WE'RE GONNA DIE NOW THAT'S IT DON'T YOU DARE 
SHE SAID SHE WAS GONNA GET THE BOYS 
I'M GONE 
SO WE DECIDED TO SCARPER 
I'VE JUST REMEMBERED I'VE ACTUALLY GOT LOADS OF PETROL 
AND THEN OF ALL THE MOMENTS 
O. I. JUMP LEADS YOU'RE JOKING 
JUMP LEADS 
NOT NOW 
THIS IS GONNA BE THE QUICKEST JUMP IN HISTORY 
YOU GET THE LEADS I'LL START IT TELL YOUR FRIEND 
IF HE TEARS UP MY PARKING LOT AGAIN 
THE REDNECKS ARRIVED 
WE'VE JUST GOT A SLIGHT PROBLEM HERE 
THIS IS BAD 
THEN THEY TURNED ON THE FILM CREWS 
HEY 
QUICK 
ROCKS STARTED PELTING OUR VANS' 
GO GET OUT OF HERE 
WHAT'S HAPPENING 
FOR THE NEXT FEW MOMENTS OUR T. V. PROGRAMME BECAME A RADIO SHOW 
OH THERE ARE THE PICK UP TRUCKS 
GET YOUR FOOT DOWN I THINK WE'VE GOT A LOAD OF THEM ON OUR TAIL 
SOMETHING'S GOING ON HERE I'M TELLING YOU 
THESE THREE TRUCKS THAT WERE IN THE PETROL STATION HAVE NOW JUST TORN PAST US 
WE NEED TO GET THESE SLOGANS OFF LADS 
PULL OVER PULL OVER 
GET THE OTHER SIDE 
NOTHING TO WIPE IT OFF WITH NOW 
I'M DOING SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT I'D DO 
I AM RUNNING FOR THE BORDER 
GOD IN HEAVEN THAT WAS ACTUALLY FRIGHTENING 
THEY COULD HAVE KILLED US 
THEY REALLY DO HAVE AN IRONY DEFICIENCY 
I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT IN CERTAIN PARTS OF AMERICA NOW 
PEOPLE HAVE STARTED TO MATE WITH VEGETABLES 
AND THEN WITH ONE PROBLEM BEHIND US WE RAN STRAIGHT INTO ANOTHER 
WHOA LIGHTNING 
YOU THINK THIS IS GOD PUNISHING US 
I'M 
DID YOU HEAR THAT 
IT WAS A GREAT TIME TO DISCOVER THAT THE WIPERS IN MY CAR WERE WORSE THAN USELESS' 
THIS IS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A HORROR FILM NOW 
I'M IN SERIOUS TROUBLE I CANNOT SEE A DAMN THING 
THERE WERE NO EXITS AND STOPPING ON THE HARD SHOULDER IN RAIN LIKE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN SUICIDAL 
SO THERE WAS ONLY ONE CHOICE 
GO RIGHT JEREMY 
YEAH NOW THIS IS VERY BAD 
LEFT A BIT 
PLEASE STOP RAINING PLEASE STOP RAINING PLEASE STOP RAINING 
THE OTHER LANE GO RIGHT 
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA GET OUT AND KILL MYSELF 
PUT MYSELF OUT OF MY MISERY OH HELL'S TEETH 
WHAT WITH THE STORM AND THE ROCK THROWING REDNECKS 
OUR FLY DRIVE HOLIDAY WASN'T GOING THAT WELL 
I JUST WANTED TO GET ON THE BIG BRITISH JET AND GO HOME 
I WANT TO BE MET BY A HOMOSEXUAL IN GREY FLANNEL TROUSERS 
SAYING WELCOME ON BOARD MR. CLARKSON CAN I GET YOU A SCONE 
ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN MILES TO NEW ORLEANS 
COME ON CAMARO 
I WAS BORN IN THE WAGON OF A TRAVELLING SHOW 
YES THAT'S IT 
WE'RE IN LOUISIANA 
GYPSYS TRAMPS AND THIEVES BY CHER 
ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS GET THERE AND SELL OUR CARS' 
AND THAT ACTUALLY WOULD BE QUITE A SAD MOMENT 
I LOVE MY CADILLAC 
I MEAN WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER WHAT A FEW DAYS 
AND WE'VE HAD THIS FANTASTIC ADVENTURE TOGETHER ALL ACROSS AMERICA AND IT'S MY CAR NOW 
I KNOW ALL ITS FOIBLES 
IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST TRUCK IT'S NOT THE FASTEST IT'S NOT THE BEST LOOKING 
BUT IT JUST KEEPS GOING IT'S LIKE A LITTLE WELSH PONY 
I RESPECT THAT 
THIS CAR REALLY IS LIKE LIVING IN AN OLD HOUSE 
YOU KNOW TO KICK THE BACK DOOR IN A CERTAIN WAY TO MAKE IT OPEN 
IT'S THE SAME WITH THIS I KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE POWER STEERING GOING 
I KNOW HOW TO GET THE BEST OUT OF WHAT'S LEFT OF THE CLUTCH 
I LIKED IT AS A KIND OF JOKE WHEN WE STARTED BUT NOW WE'RE LIKE THAT 
CROSSING THE CENTRAL RESERVATION 
OF MY IMAGINATION 
OF COURSE THERE WERE CERTAIN OTHER PROBLEMS WITH SELLING OUR CARS' 
THERE'S A VERY BAD CADILLAC WEAVE GOING ON ON THIS STRAIGHT STRETCH HERE 
I'LL KEEP THE WORRY BEADS TO HAND 
WHOA 
RELAX 
WE'RE IN NEW ORLEANS AND SOMETHING HAS COME OFF THE CAMARO 
THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE IS OFF THE SCALE 
COME ON 
FINALLY THOUGH WE MADE IT 
AND MY WORD WERE WE IN FOR A SHOCK 
WE HAD SEEN ON THE NEWS WHAT HURRICANE KATRINA HAD DONE 
BUT SEEING THE DEVASTATION FOR REAL WAS TRULY ASTONISHING 
OH MY GOD 
OH LOOK AT THAT 
WELL THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY 
EVERY HOUSE I'VE BEEN DRIVING NOW WHAT FIFTEEN MILES 
THERE ISN'T A PAVEMENT THERE ISN'T A BUILDING 
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THAT ISN'T SMASHED 
IT'S SUCH A VAST SCALE OF DESTRUCTION 
A YEAR HAD PASSED SINCE KATRINA HAD BLOWN THROUGH 
AND WE SORT OF ASSUMED THAT AFTER TWELVE MONTHS THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON EARTH WOULD HAVE FIXED IT 
BUT WE WERE WRONG 
HOW CAN THE REST OF AMERICA SLEEP AT NIGHT 
KNOWING THAT THIS IS HERE 
IT CERTAINLY GAVE US A PROBLEM 
THE ORIGINAL PLAN HAD BEEN FOR US TO SELL OUR CARS HERE 
AND SEE WHO COULD GET THE MOST MONEY 
WE THEREFORE HAD A CONFAB AND DECIDED WE SHOULD GIVE OUR CARS AWAY 
SO WE CALLED THE LOCAL MISSION 
WHO PUT US IN TOUCH WITH SOME FAMILIES WHO'D LOST THEIRS IN KATRINA 
IT'S GOT AN ALLOY IT'S NOT BEEN MESSED WITH IN ANY WAY 
IT'S DONE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MILES AND LOOK IT'S LIKE NEW UNDER THERE 
I LIKE IT DONE IT'S YOURS TAKE THE TRUCK IT'S YOURS 
LOOK AFTER IT IT'S BEEN A GOOD FRIEND TO ME 
ALL RIGHT WE APPRECIATE IT 
JEREMY DID HIS USUAL TRICK OF TELLING IT LIKE IT IS' 
REV COUNTER NOT GOOD SPEEDO NOT GOOD 
FUEL GAUGE NOT GOOD 
DENT ON THE ROOF THAT WAS CAUSED BY A COW 
AS FAR AS DRIVING IT IS CONCERNED THE ENGINE IS BRILLIANT 
GEARBOX TIPTOP 
IT'S A GOOD CAR IT'S ALL YOURS 
SO ALTHOUGH IT HADN'T BEEN THE MOST RELAXING HOLIDAY 
IT HAD BEEN A PROPER BOY'S OWN ADVENTURE 
AND WHAT'S MORE WE COULD GO HOME KNOWING THAT WE'D DONE A LITTLE BIT 
TO HELP THOSE LESS FORTUNATE THAN OURSELVES 
WELL RICHARD AND I COULD BUT JAMES SADLY COULDN'T EVEN GIVE HIS CAR AWAY 
IT'S STILL HERE A FAMILY CAME ROUND THIS CORNER NOT TEN MINUTES AGO 
THANK YOU WE LOST EVERYTHING IN KATRINA AND THEY REJECTED IT 
DO YOU WANT A LIFT TO THE AIRPORT IN MY CAR 
NO ME NEITHER 
TA RA 
HAMMOND CAN I BORROW THE JUMP LEADS NO 
LOSER LOSER 
HEY I RECKON IF YOU LOOK ON GOOGLE EARTH YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE HIS CAR 
COS IT'LL STILL BE THERE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IT COS IT'S BIG ENOUGH 
O. K. SO THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT JAMES LOST THAT CHALLENGE 
AND EQUALLY WE KNOW THAT I WON 
HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT THAT 
WELL MY CAMARO WAS THE FASTEST IT HAD THE BEST BRAKES 
IT DIDN'T BREAK DOWN APART FROM THE WIPERS MUCH 
SO IT WAS THE BEST 
IT WASN'T QUITE AS EASY TO GIVE AWAY AS YOU MADE OUT IN THAT FILM 
WELL THERE'S SORT OF 
WHY DON'T YOU TELL THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE CAMERAS HAD BEEN TURNED OFF YEAH 
WELL A LADY CAME AND SHE SAID SHE WAS A LAWYER REPRESENTING THE CHRISTIAN MISSION WE'D GONE TO 
AND SHE SAID SHE'D BEEN PROMISED BY ONE OF OUR RESEARCHERS A NINETEEN NINETY ONE CAMARO AND IT WAS AN EIGHTY NINE 
AND SHE SAID THAT WAS MISREPRESENTATION AND SHE WAS GOING TO SUE ME 
IT REALLY DID HAPPEN IT REALLY DID HAPPEN 
SHE THEN SAID THAT IF I GAVE HER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CASH SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE THE CASE GO AWAY 
AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO US NEXT 
NO WHICH WAS THAT A VERY LARGE PICK UP TURNED UP 
FULL OF HEAVILY ARMED BURLY MEN 
AND TOLD US TO GET OFF THEIR STREET YES 
SO REALLY WE DO HAVE TWO TOP GEAR TOP TIPS FOR YOU TONIGHT 
ONE YES YOU CAN BUY RATHER THAN RENT 
AND TWO DON'T GO TO AMERICA 
TOP GEAR'S BACK TO ITS NORMAL SELF NEXT WEEK 
SO WE'LL SEE YOU THEN GOOD NIGHT
