LIFE YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE IT 
BUT ARE OUR POLITICIANS FIT TO 
JUDGE WHAT IT IS WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE 
IT 
TONIGHT AS LAW MAKING GOES IT 
DOESN'T GET MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT 
THAN WHAT'S HAPPENING TONIGHT AND 
TOMORROW IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
IN DECISIONS ON EMBRYOS FERTILITY 
TREATMENT AND ABORTION 
AS M. P.'S MAKE SOME OF THE MOST 
ETHICALLY CHARGED JUDGEMENTS TO 
COME BEFORE PARLIAMENT IN A 
GENERATION WE DEBATE WHETHER 
SCIENCE REALLY IS ADRIFT FROM 
MORALITY 
ALL OF THIS UNDER YOUR CONTROL 
THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER PROMISES TO 
CUT GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
ARE HIS PLANS A BIT FISHY THE THE PRICE OF FLOUR HAS TRIPLED SINCE 
CHRISTMAS 
AND HOW HARD TIMES ARE CHRISTMAS CHANGING THE WAYS SMALL TIME 
AMERICA LOOKS AT THE PEOPLE WHO 
WANT THEIR VOTES FOR PRESIDENT 
GOOD EVENING THE GOVERNMENT 
TONIGHT SURVIVED TWO KEY CHALLENGES 
TO ITS CONTROVERSIAL PLANS TO 
UPDATE THE LAW ON EMBRYO RESEARCH 
BEFORE WE CAME ON AIR M. P.'S REJECTED 
CALLS FOR A BAN ON TECHNIQUES THAT 
LET SCIENTISTS CREATE SO CALLED 
SAVIOUR SIBLES THEY VOTED TO 
ALLOW THE CREATION OF HYBRID 
EMBRYOS TOMORROW COME LOWERING THE 
AGE LIMIT ON ABORTIONS AND WHETHER 
FOR I. V. F. THE LAW REQUIRES 
RECOGNITION OF A FATHER FIGURE THE 
BILL AMOUNTS TO A BIGGEST 
REAPPRAISAL OF THE LAW ON THESE 
MATTERS FOR A GENERATION 
THEY ARE ISSUES NOTHING SHORT OF 
THE CREATION AND DESTRUCTION OF THE 
STUFF OF LIFE OVER THE COURSE OF 
TODAY AND TOMORROW POLITICIANS HAVE 
BEEN ASKED TO GRAPPLE WITH SOME OF 
THE MOST COMPLICATED SCIENCE AND 
CHALLENGING ETHICAL DEBATES AROUND 
UPDATING THE LAW TO TAKE ACCOUNT 
OF SCIENTIFIC PROCESS SINCE THE 
HUMAN FERTILISATION AND EMBRYOLOGY 
ACT CAME IN NEARLY TO YEARS AGO 
THIS BILL DEALS WITH WHAT WE MEAN 
BY HUMAN WHEN DOES LIFE BEGIN 
DOES AN EMBRYO HAVE A SOUL DO WE 
HAVE THE RIGHT TO CREATE AN EMBRYO 
PART COW OR PART RABBIT AND HUMAN 
AND SHOULD PARENTS BE ALLOWED TO 
CREATE A CHILD TO TREAT A DISEASE 
ININ' AN OLDER BROTHER OR SISTER 
AS SOME BELIEVE THESE STRIPPERS OF 
HUMANITY OR EXPERIMENTATION 
BECAUSE WE CAN IT'S A MONUMENTAL 
CLASH OF SCIENCE MORALITY AND THE 
LAW AND FAITH WHICH SOONER OR 
LATER MAY AFFECT US ALL THERE ARE 
FOUR FREE VOTES INVOLVED THE FIRST 
WAS ON SO CALLED HYBRID EMBRYOS 
SCIENTISTS WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE 
THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF HUMAN EGGS 
FOR RESEARCH THE IDEA IS TO USE 
ANIMAL EGGS INSTEAD SUCH AS COW OR 
RABBIT REMOVE THE GENES AND 
RESEARCH D. N. A. THE RESULT IS A TINY 
CLUSTER OF CELLS AN EM BORROW THAT 
HAS TO BE DESTROYED AFTER FOURTEEN DAYS 
WHICH IS LARGELY HUMAN THE AIM IS 
TO EXTRACT EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS 
THIS IS TECHNOLOGY LIKELY TO BE 
ABLE TO DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS IN 
TERMS OF MEDICINE IN THE FUTURE 
WHEN YOU SAY WHERE ARE THE BIG 
ADVANCES GOING TO COME THEY WILL 
COME THROUGH GENETICS AND THIS AREA 
OF MEDICINE THE VAST MAJORITY OF 
MEDICAL CHARITIES AND RESEARCH 
BODIES IN THE U. K. SUPPORT THE USE OF 
EMBRYOS THE BILL ALLOWS FOR 
SCIENTISTS TO GO FURTHER CREATING 
EMBRYOS UP TO A FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. HUMAN ANIMAL 
MIX A BAN ATTEMPTING TO BAN THAT 
WAS CLOSER THE LEADING OPPONENT TO 
THE RESEARCH WAS TORY EDWARD LEIGH 
THIS IS ETHICALLY WRONG AND ALMOST 
CERTAINLY MEDICALLY USELESS IF NOT 
USELESS THERE'S NO EVIDENCE AS YET 
TO SUBSTANTIATE IT IT IS SAID BY 
THOSE WHO RESIST THIS AMENDMENT 
THAT WE CAN RELY ON REGULATION BUT 
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT REGULATION 
IS ENOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS 
A STEP TOO FAR AND THEREFORE IT 
SHOULD BE BANNED 
M. P.'S THOUGH 
APPEAR TO HAVE SEEN THE NEED FOR 
THIS RESEARCH TO CARRY ON WITH A 
VOTE OF THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX FOR AND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX AGAINST MR. 
LEIGH'S CALL FOR AN OUTRIGHT BAN 
THE SECOND VOTE WAS SAVIOUR 
SYBILINGS USING THE MAIN 
SCIENTIFIC VANS FAMILIES SUCH AS 
THE WHITAKERS HAVE BENEFITTED FROM 
THE TECHNOLOGY CALLED 
PREIMPLAMENTATION DIAGNOSIS IT 
ALLOWS EMBRYOS CREATED BY I. V. F. TO BE 
CHECKED FOR GENETIC DISEASE 
DOCTORS WITH SCENE I. V. F. EMBRYOS SO 
FAMILIES WITH ONE CHILD WITH A 
GENETIC DISEASE CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE 
A SECOND FREE OF THE INHERITED OF 
THE CONDITION BUT A TISSUE MATCH 
FOR THE OLDER SIBLING SO CAN 
PROVIDE BLOOD OR BONE MARROW TO 
TREAT THEM THE SCIENCE APPEARS TO 
WORK OPPONENT WORRY ABOUT CREATING 
CHILDREN AS DONORS SUPPORTERS SAY 
THE LAW PROTECTS HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
THE LOVE IT HOLDS WILL BE MORE 
TOMORROW SEES THE THIRD FREE VOTE 
TO REMOVE THE OBLIGATION ON I. V. F. 
CLINICS TO CONSIDER THE CHILD'S 
NEED FOR A FATHER THE GOVERNMENT 
SAYS THIS BRINGS THE LAW IN LINE 
WITH WHAT HAPPENS IN CLINICS WITH 
SINGLE WOMEN AND LESBIAN COUPLES 
ARE TREATED OPPONENTS SAY IT IS AN 
ATTACK ON THE FATHER'S ROLE AT A 
TIME SOCIETY SHOULD SIGNAL THE 
CRUCIAL PART IN THEIR BRINGING UP 
CHILDREN AND A FINAL FREE VOTE 
CRUCIAL PART IN THEIR BRINGING UP CHILDREN AND A FINAL FREE VOTE 
TO 
LOWER THE LIMITS ON ABORTIONS THIS 
CURRENTLY STANDS AT TWENTY FOUR WEEKS 
OPPONENTS SAY IT SHOULD COME DOWN 
TO TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY WEEKS BOTH SIDES OF 
THE DEBATE HAVE O. QUOTED RESULTS 
FROM SINGLE STUDIES ONE SPECIALIST 
WHOSE RESULTS HAVE BEEN CITED BY 
BOTH CAMPS IS CLEAR WHERE THE 
LAW STANDS 
THERE HAS BEEN NO 
LAW STANDS CHANGE AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE WEEKS BUT AT TWENTY FOUR 
AND TWENTY FIVE WE HAVE SEEN A CLEAR CHANGE 
BY TOMORROW THE END OF TOMORROW 
PRESSURE WILL BUILD FOR CALLS OF 
ETHICS BIO COMMISSION OF SOME KIND 
TO SETTLE SUCH ISSUES OUTSIDE OF 
PARLIAMENT WHAT IS THE LATEST FROM 
THE COMMONS 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS WON 
ALL FIVE BIG AMENDMENTS QUITE 
COMFORTABLY AS SUSAN WATTS SAID ON 
HYBRID EMBRYOS THE FIRST AMENDMENT 
THE GOVERNMENT WON BY ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SECOND 
AMENDMENT PUT FORWARD BY ANDREW 
LANCELY WHICH WOULD HAVE BANNED 
FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. HYBRIDS THE GOVERNMENT ONLY 
WON BY A MAJORITY OF SIXTY THREE ON THE 
AMENDMENTS OF SAVIOUR SIBLINGS 
THEY WERE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
AND ANY INTERESTING VOTING 
DECISIONS GORDON 
DECISIONS GORDON BROWN ALLOWED MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO VOTE 
WITH CONSCIENCES ON THE QUESTIONS 
AND RUTH KELLY AND DES BROWNE AND 
PAUL MURPHY ALL VOTED FOR THE 
BACKBENCH AMENDMENT ON HYBRID 
EMBRYOS WHICH WOULD HAVE BLOCKED 
ALL HYBRIDS THEY ARE ALL CATHOLICS 
ANOTHER CATHOLIC ANDREW BURNHAM 
VOTED WITH THE GOVERNMENT THERE 
WAS A SPLIT ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE 
DAVID CAMERON AND GEORGE OSBORNE 
AND FIVE OTHER MEMBERS ON THE 
SHADOW CABINET BACKED THE 
GOVERNMENT ON THE HYBRID EMBRYO 
QUESTION THE BAN ON ALL HYBRIDS 
THIRTEEN MEMBERS OF THE SHADOW CABINET 
SUPPORTED THE BACKBENCH AMENDMENT 
HOW IS IT LOOKING FOR THE ABORTION 
VOTE TOMORROW 
THE FACT IT WAS 
QUITE TIGHT ON HYBRID EMBRYOS ON 
THE QUESTION OF THE FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. HYBRIDS 
SUGGESTS IT COULD BE QUITE A TIGHT 
VOTE TOMORROW THIS THERE ARE QUITE 
A LOT OF M. P.'S WHO THINK IT IS LIKELY 
THAT THE HOUSE WILL VOTE TO BRING 
IT DOWN FROM TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY TWO OR MAYBE TWENTY 
WE'RE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY 
CHARLES WOOKEY AND STEPHEN MINGER 
AND BY THE BIOETHICS PROFESSOR 
DAVID JONES JOINING US FROM THE 
CENTRAL LOBBY IN WESTMINSTER IS 
DAWN PRIMAROLO PROFESSOR MINGER 
YOU MUST BE FAIRLY PLEASED AREN'T 
YOU 
I AM IT HAS BEEN A LONG AND YOU ARDUOUS JOURNEY OVER THE LAST TWO 
AND A HALF YEARS FROM THE TIME WE 
FIRST BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT CREATING 
THESE TYPES OF EMBRYOS THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS INITIALLY VERY 
OPPOSED TO WHAT WE WANTED TO DO 
CAROLINE FLINT SAID SHE EXPECTED 
THE GOVERNMENT TO BAN THE RESEARCH 
AND THE H. F. A. TO BAN IT HERE WE ARE 
WITH A VERY STRONG BILL WHICH 
ALLOWS THE BILL TO GO FORWARD IT IT PROVES THE M. P.'S DID NOT FALL FOR 
YOUR SCAREMONGERING 
THE ISSUES AND 
THE DEBATES SHOWN TODAY HAVE 
ILLUSTRATED HOW SERIOUSLY THE ISSUE 
HAS BEEN TAKEN WE HAVE SEEN A 
THROW AND SEARCHING DEBATE THE 
ISSUES ARE THE EFFICACY OF THE 
SCIENCE AND THE PROFOUND ETHICAL 
ISSUES THAT THE HYBRID CYBRID 
EMBRYO BRING 
I GUESS YOU'RE 
PLEASED THERE HAS BEEN A SERIOUS 
DEBATE AND PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT 
ABOUT IT 
ABSOLUTELY THE CYBRID 
QUESTION IS A NEW ONE ETHICAL AND 
SCIENTIFIC ONE 
HOW DO YOU MAKE THE 
JUDGMENT ABOUT THE RELATIVE 
BENEFITS IN A CASE LIKE THIS WELL WELL I THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME 
SENSE OF WHAT YOU MEAN BY NEED OR 
ALTERNATIVE SO YOU MIGHT SAY DO 
WE ARE DO WE HAVE IN LAW FOR 
SOME CASES YOU SAY IT IS JUST THE 
BENEFITS SOME CASES JUST THE 
BALANCE OF PROBTS SOME CASES YOU 
SAY IT IS THE BENEFIT OF THE 
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT IF YOU 
HAVE A ETHICAL CLAIM YOU HAVE TO 
SHOW BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT 
THERE'S NEED THERE HAS BEEN 
DISPUTE ABOUT WHETHER IT IS PROVED 
THIS IS NOT BALANCE OF 
PROBABILITIES THIS IS BEYOND A 
REASONABLE DOUBT THERE'S NEEDS HERE 
THIS DEBATE DID GET BEYOND THE 
STUPID CHANGE OF FRANKENSTEIN 
ALTHOUGH OCCASIONALLY THE TERM HAS 
BEEN USED NOT TER ABLY WELL CAN 
YOU EXPLAIN CRY BRIDS MY MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT IS AN HUMAN 
EMBRYO KNEW INCLUDES PUT IN A 
ANIMAL OR COW EGG EGG MOST OF THE 
D. N. A. IS EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY PER CENT HUMAN AND THE 
CYTOPLASM IS ANIMAL THE REASON YOU 
WANT TO DO RESEARCH IT IS PRETTY 
NEARLY HUMAN BUT IT'S MUCH MORE 
DIFFICULT TO GET HOLD OF HUMAN EGGS 
IT IS NOT ETHICALLY SKRIEABLE TO 
ASK LARGE NUMBERS OF WOMEN TO 
UNDERGO A PROCEDURE INVASIVE 
PROCEDURE TO MAKE EGGS OF THOUSANDS 
ONCE YOU START VARYING THE 
PROPORTIONS YOU GET INTO DIFFERENT 
TERRITORY 
I DON'T THINK SO THE TERRITORY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS PUSHED 
THE DEBATE WHEN YOU TAKE AN ANIMAL 
EGG AND REMOVE THE CHROME SONS AND 
THE NUCLEAR INCLUDES FROM THE EGG 
WHICH CONFIRMS SPECIES IDENTITY 
INTO THE EGG AND TRANSPLANT HUMAN 
CELL INTO IT YOU TRANSFER HUMAN 
IDENTITY INTO THE EGG YOU WOULD 
HAVE A SMALL RESIDUAL PART OF THE 
MITHRCHONDRIA WHICH WOULD BE ANIMAL 
BUT MOST WOULD BE HUMAN 
AREN'T YOU 
CONCERNED ALL YOU HAVE DONE IS PASS 
THE BUCK TO THE AUTHORITY 
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS HERE AND IT 
SHOWS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF OUR 
ABILITIES TO DISCUSS WHAT ARE 
ETHICALLY CHALLENGING ISSUES AND 
SET A FRAMEWORK WHICH WE SEE THE 
SCIENCE FRAMEWORK AND AFTER 
SETTING UP THE HUMAN FERTILISATION 
AND EMBRYOLOGY DEPARTMENT WHICH 
HAS DONE A GREAT JOB UNTIL NOW I'M 
CONFIDENT THIS BILL CONTINUES TO 
PROVIDE THE SHAPE OF THE REGULATION 
TO ENSURE WE KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON 
WE MAKE SURE IT IS IN THE AREAS WE 
WANT TO SEE AND PUT THE NECESSARY 
SAFEGUARDS ON IT 
THAT IS 
WHAT WE 
WOULD EXPECT PARLIAMENT TO DO 
ANOTHER ETHICAL ISSUE RAISED IN 
THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF SAVIOUR 
SIBLINGS NO ONE YOU WOULD NO ONE 
WOULD REALLY DENY THE BENEFITS OF 
THIS BUT YOU DO DENY THE BENEFITS 
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD DENY 
THE BENEFITS IF YOU CAN THE 
QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE ETHICS AS 
WELL AS THE BENEFITS IN ALL THESE 
CONSIDERATIONS WE HAVE TWO 
COMPETING THINGS WE HAVE THE 
WELFARE ARGUMENT 
WE KNOW IT WORKS 
WE KNOW IT WORK BUT THE QUESTION 
IS IS IT RIGHT TO SET UP LAW 
WHICH ALLOWS HUMAN BEINGS TO BE 
CREATED PRIMARILY FOR THE BENEFIT 
OF OTHERS THAT IS VERY PROFOUND 
QUESTION ALTHOUGH THERE ARE HUGELY 
HARD QUESTIONS AND EVERYONE'S HEART 
GOES OUT TO PEOPLE WITH KIDS WITH 
BLOOD DISORDERS AND SO ON IT IS 
VERY DIFFICULT 
THIS IS NEW 
TERRITORY ALL TOGETHER THE IDEA 
THAT YOU CAN SACRIFICE SOME 
POTENTIAL HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE 
BENEFIT OF OTHERS 
I DON'T KNOW IF 
I WOULD PUT IT IN THOSE TERMS OF OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T 
IN THE TERMS 
IN LOOKING AT OUR RESEARCH IN 
PARTICULAR I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE 
EMBRYOS THAT WE ARE CREATING BY 
INTERSPECIES TRANSFER CLONING 
TECHNOLOGY NEVER HAD THE POTENTIAL 
TO TURN INTO HUMAN LIFE BECAUSE AN 
EMBRYO IN A DISH WILL ONLY TURN 
INTO A HUMAN BEING UPON 
IMPLANTATION IF IT NEVER HAS THE 
POTENTIAL TO BE IMPLANTED IT NEVER 
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A HUMAN 
BEING IT THE SAME IN SAVIOUR BEING SIBLINGS 
THEY ARE NOT BEING SIBLINGS SACRIFICED THEY ARE IMPLANTED THE THE ONES CHOSEN NOT TO BE SAVIOUR 
SIBLINGS ARE NOT PUT IN 
WE MAKE 
DECISIONS AROUND EMBRYO SELECTION 
EVERY TIME WE DO I. V. F. THERE ARE 
EMBRYOS SELECTED WHICH HAVE THE 
POTENTIAL TO SURVIVE IMPLANTATION 
AND MORE LIKELY TO CREATE A VIABLE 
BABY THAN OTHERS 
WHAT ABOUT YOU 
THERE ARE TWO ISSUES ONE IS ABOUT 
THE EMBRYO AND THE CHILD PRODUCED 
IF SOMEBODY SUGGESTED THAT THEY FOR 
EXAMPLE WOULD HAVE ADOPTION AND 
THEY WOULD WANT TO ADOPT CHILD TO 
BE A SAVIOUR SIBLING AND THEY GO 
TO SOME COUNTRY AND SCREEN 
A WHOLE 
LOT OF CHILDREN AND SAY 
HERE IS 
CHILD I DO WANT TO ADOPT BUT I 
WANT IT TO BE A SAVIOUR SIBLING 
TO THE CHILD I HAVE 
ALREADY PEOPLE 
WOULD SAY THERE IS DANGEROUS MIXED 
MOTIVE ABOUT WANTING THE 
CHILD FOR 
ITSELF AND WANTING THE CHILD 
SOMEBODY ELSE 
THAT 
IS A 
FOR HOW 
YOU VALUE 
THE 
IS A QUESTION ABOUT VALUING 
CHILD FOR 
ITS OWN SAKE OR VALUING 
THE CHILD FOR THE SAKE OF ANOTHER 
DAWN PRIMAROLO 
YOU ARE 
SHAKING YOUR 
HEAD DOWN THERE AT WESTMINSTER I 
DON'T AGREE 
I THINK WHAT IS 
MISSING IN THIS DISCUSSION 
IS THERE 
ARE MANY REASONS WHY PEOPLE HAVE 
CHILDREN 
IN THESE 
VERY EXTREME 
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE 
WE 
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE HAVE A LOVING 
FAMILY THAT 
IS DESPERATE TO 
SAVE THEIR CHILD 
WHAT 
THIS BILL 
DOES IS 
SAY THAT UNDER THOSE RARE 
AND UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE 
SECOND CHILD WILL BE DESPERATELY 
LOVED AS WELL UNDER CERTAIN 
CONDITIONS THE REGULATORY 
AUTHORITIES CAN CONSIDER ON A CASE 
BY CASE BASIS WHETHER THEY PROVIDE 
FOR THAT LICENSE AND WHEN WE LOOK 
AT WHY WE HAVE CHILDREN YOU KNOW 
SOME PEOPLE HAVE CHILDREN BECAUSE 
THEY WANT TO BE 
PARENTS OTHERS 
HAVE CHILDREN 
BECAUSE THEY 
WANT TO 
SEE A BROTHER OR A 
SISTER THERE 
ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF COMPLEX 
REASONS AND WE SHOULDN'T JUDGE 
SOME HOW THESE FAMILIES THAT ARE IN 
ABSOLUTELY A TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE 
IN TRYING TO SAVE THE LIFE OF THEIR 
CHILD ANY DIFFERENTLY THAT IS WHAT 
THE BILL PROVIDES FOR 
LET'S LOOK 
AT THIS QUESTION OF ABORTION WHICH 
IS COMING UP TOMORROW YOU 
PRESUMABLY ARE IN FAVOUR OF THE 
TIME REDUCTION ARE YOU YES BUT YES BUT THEN PRESUMABLY YOU ARE AGAINST ALL 
ABORTION AREN'T YOU 
THE CHURCH 
VIEWS ARE ABSOLUTELY THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH'S VIEW ON ABORTION IS NOT A 
PAPAL SECRET BUT THE QUESTION IS 
WHAT IS ACHIEVABLE IN TERMS OF A 
REDUCTION ALSO I THINK IN THIS 
WHOLE CONTEXT OF THE ABORTION 
DEBATE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
LAW BUT THE LAW IS IN A SENSE I 
THINK SECONDARY THAT IS A SLIGHTLY 
STRANGE THING TO SAY ABOUT ABORTION 
BUT IF 
YOU THINK 
ABOUT IT 
THE LAW 
WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY NOW FORCES 
NOBODY 
TO HAVE 
AN 
ABORTION YOU 
COULD REDUCE 
THE NUMBER I HAVE A 
BORGSS IN THE U. K. FROM TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TO 
ZERO WITHOUT CHANGING THE LAW IT 
DOESN'T FORCE ANYBODY 
HOW DOING 
THAT 
BY PEOPLE DECIDING NOT TO THAT HAVE THEM WHAT THAT RAISES IS THE 
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION ABOUT WHY IT 
IS IN OUR SOCIETY THAT THERE ARE SO 
MANY ABORTIONS AND THE REASONS FOR 
THOSE WHICH GO WAY BEYOND 
LEGISLATION 
THIS HAS NOTHING AT LEGISLATION ALL TO DO GIVEN THAT SOCIETY HAS 
LEGITIMISED ABORTION HAS NOTHING 
TO DO WITH THE AGE UP TO WHICH IT 
IS PERMISSIBLE IT 
INVITE 
IS PERMISSIBLE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE UNDERLYING 
ISSUES ARE WHICH ARE MORE THAN 
LEGISLATION I AGREE IN THINKING 
ABOUT THE DEBATE TOMORROW THAT IS 
WHERE THE CHURCH WOULD BE DAWN DAWN PRIMAROLO ARE YOU NOT CONCERNED 
ABOUT THESE FIGURES THEY HAVE BEEN 
MISQUOTED AND BANDIED ABOUT BUT 
THERE IS A HIGHER THAN PREVIOUS 
SURVIVAL RATE AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THREE 
WEEKS ARE YOU NOT CONCERNED ABOUT 
THAT 
THERE IS NO SCIENCE THAT THAT SHOWS THAT THE SURVIVAL RATES OF 
CHANGED SINCE WE TOOK THE DECISION 
TO HAVE THE TIME LIMIT AT TWENTY FOUR WEEKS 
THAT'S SUPPORTED BY THE B. M. A. THE 
ROYAL COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANSS 
THERE IS PROFESSOR HERE SHAKE HIS HEAD 
THIS IS DISPUTED 
IT IS NOT HEAD DISPUTED 
THEY ARE DISPUTED 
IT IS DISPUTED NOT 
I WOULD HAVE PEOPLE WHO NOT WORKING IN THIS AREA WHO DISPUTE 
WITH ONE ANOTHER THE BASIS AND 
BECAUSE IT ISTH SO MUCH DEPENDS ON 
THE INDIVIDUAL CLINICS AND HOW WELL 
THEY HAVE DONE OR HOW WELL THEY 
HAVEN'T IF YOU THINK THERE HAS 
BEEN A CHANGE HERE 
I ASSURE YOU THERE IS A DISPUTE 
ABOUT THE 
DISPUTE IS SOME PEOPLE ABOUT THE DON'T AGREE WITH ABORTION AND SOME 
PEOPLE ARE ADVANCING A CASE FOR 
REDUCTION IN THE TIME LIMIT 
HE IS 
MAKING A DIFFERENT POINT 
THE FACTS 
ARE QUITE CLEAR 
I'M SAYING THERE 
ARE CLINICIANS WHO PUBLISH DATA 
WHO DISPUTE THE INTERPRETATION OF 
THIS DATA AMONG THEMSELVES NO 
DOUBT THEY HAVE MORAL VIEWS BUT 
THEY ALSO DO DISPUTE THE PEOPLE 
WHO ARE IN FAVOUR OF IT HAVE MORAL 
VIEWS 
YOU ARE STACKING SOME VIEWS STATISTICS AGAINST THE VAST 
MAJORITY THE HOUSE WILL MAKE UP 
ITS MIND TOMORROW T. SHOULD VOTE IN 
FAVOUR OF THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND 
UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXTIES OF 
ABORTION 
YOU GOT YOUR POINT IN ABORTION THERE LET ME MAKE ONE OTHER POINT 
TO YOU THIS QUESTION OF THE 
SUGGESTION THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO 
HAVE I. V. F. YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE 
COULD GO N. I. S. SENT OF A CHILD'S NEED 
FOR A FAVOUR WHY DOESN'T THE 
GOVERNMENT RECOGNISE THAT THE THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THAT EVERYONE 
CHILD SHOULD BE IN A LOVING 
SUPPORTIVE FAMILY WITH SUPPORTIVE 
PARENTING IF WE MAKE 
DISCRIMINATION IN THE LAW AND DRIVE 
SOME PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE 
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WHAT WE DO IS 
INCREASE RISK TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS 
AND REENSURE THAT THE CHILD WILL 
NEVER KNOW BECAUSE IT IS OUTSIDE 
OF THE REGULATION WHO THEIR NATURAL 
FATHER IS WHICH IS AN ABSOLUTE 
RIGHT THAT IS PROVIDED WITHIN THAT 
BILL THAT HAS TO BE IMPORTANT 
FAMILIES HAVE SIMPLY CHANGED WE WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT 
HAPPENS TOMORROW WITH THAT TOO 
IF THERE WAS A CONSERVATIVE 
GOVERNMENT THERE WOULD BE LESS TAX 
AND THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE 
BORROWING LESS SO CLAIMS AN 
UNBIASED FIGURE A MEMBER OF THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
THE ART OF TAXATION IT IS SAID TO 
PUBLIC THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF 
FEATHERS FROM THE GOOSE WITH THE 
MINIMUM AMOUNT OF HISSING SINCE 
THE TORIES ARE COMMITTED TO WHAT 
LABOUR IS SPENDING IS IT 
PLAUSIBLE PLAUSIBLE LAST WEEK IT WAS TRAINSPOTTING IN 
CREWE TODAY AN ACTIVITY WITH WHICH 
I'M RATHER LESS FAMILIAR GOOD 
HOUSE KEEPING THAT WAS THE THEME 
TAKEN UP BY DAVID CAMERON IN A 
SPEECH TODAY ARGUING THAT THE 
CONSERVATIVES WOULD BE BETTER AT 
RUNNING THE ECONOMY AND THE 
NATION'S FINANCES THAN LABOUR HAS 
BEEN BEEN NOW THAT'S A TEAM THAT WOULDN'T 
REALLY HAVE WORKED FOR MOST OF THE 
LAST TEN YEARS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE 
PUBLIC THOUGHT THAT LABOUR WAS MORE 
COMPETENT WHEN IT CAME TO ECONOMIC 
MATTERS MATTERS OF COURSE IN USING THE THEME GOOD 
HOUSEKEEPING DAVID CAMERON EVOKING 
MEMORIES OF HIS PREDECESSOR 
MARGARET THATCHER THIRTY YEARS AGO 
AS BRITAIN'S FIRST FEMALE PARTY 
LEADER MARGARET THATCHER LOVED 
PLAYING THE PRUDENT HOUSEWIFE ANY 
WOMAN WHO UNDERSTANDS THE PROBLEMS 
OF RUNNING A HOME SHE ONCE SAID 
WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE 
PROBLEMS OF RUNNING A COUNTRY AND 
TODAY OLD THATCHERITES MUST HAVE 
BEEN PLEASED BY DAVID CAMERON'S 
STRONGER NOISES ON CUTTING TAX 
WE NEED TO START LIVING WITHIN OUR 
MEANS WHY BECAUSE IN THE DECADES 
AHEAD THERE WILL BE PRESSURE TO 
SPEND MORE ON THE ESSENTIALS 
WHETHER IT IS CARE FOR THE ELDERLY 
WHETHER IT IS EQUIPMENT FOR OUR 
ARMED FORCES MORE PRISONS OR 
POLICE TO KEEP US SAFE BUT YET AT 
THE SAME TIME WE HAVE REACHED THE 
LIMITS OF ACCEPTABLE TAXATION AND 
BORROWING WITH THE RISING COST OF 
LIVING TAX PAYERS CANNOT TAKE ANY 
MORE PAIN INDEED THEY WANT A 
GOVERNMENT THAT GIVES THEM AT LEAST 
THE PROSPECT OF RELIEF AND OUR 
ECONOMY CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE PAIN 
WITHOUT LOSING JOBS TO LOWER TAX 
COMPETITORS COMPETITORS DAVID CAMERON'S SPEECH TODAY WASN'T 
ENTIRELY THATCHERITE HE EXPRESSED 
SEVERAL THEMES OF HIS LEADERSHIP 
WHICH HAVE SHOWN A CLEAR BREAK 
BETWEEN HIMSELF AND MARGARET 
THATCHER AND OTHER CONSERVATIVE 
LEADER FOR INSTANCE THE EMPHASIS 
ON IMPROVING PUBLIC SERVICES FOR 
ALL RATHER THAN JUST FOR THOSE WHO 
CAN OPT OUT 
THE STRESS UPON THE QUALITY OF LIFE 
RATHER THAN SIMPLY ON A RISING G. D. P. 
AND WHERE AS MARGARET THATCHER SAW 
HER TASK MAINLY AS REVIVING THE 
BRITISH ECONOMY DAVID CAMERON SEES 
ONE OF HIS TASKS AS REVERSING 
BRITAIN'S SOCIAL BREAKDOWN 
WHILE FULFILING THE ESSENTIAL 
REQUIREMENTS OF MODERN GOVERNMENT 
WE NEED TO PUT INTO ACTION THE GOOD 
PRINCIPLES OF GOOD HOUSE KEEPING 
THEN WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO VERY 
DIFFERENT FUTURE LOW TAX 
COMPETITIVE ECONOMY WITH HIGH 
QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE OPPORTUNITY 
FOR EVERYONE TO MAKE SOMETHING OF 
THEIR LIFE IT USED TO BE SAID 
GOOD FOOD COSTS LESS AT SAINSBURY'S 
WHAT I WANT GOOD SERVICES TO COST 
LESS WITH THE CONSERVATIVES 
BUT MR. CAMERON HIMSELF A KEEN COOK 
CHOSE TO VISIT ANOTHER WELL KNOWN 
SUPERMARKET WHEN HE WENT TO CREWE 
TODAY HIS FOURTH TRIP TO THE BY 
ELECTION CONTEST 
AND THE CONSERVATIVES' LEADER'S 
SPEECH EARLIER TODAY SHOWS HOW 
TAXES ARE FIRMLY BACK ON THE AGENDA 
POLITICS HAVE CHANGED MASSIVELY IN 
THE PAST SIX MONTHS PEOPLE ARE NOW 
STARTING TO FEEL THE PINCH FUEL 
PRICES GOING UP FOOD PRICES UP 
PEOPLE PAYING FOR MORE THEIR 
MORTGAGES PEOPLE PAYING FOR MORE 
TAX AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY 
HAVE AS A HOUSEHOLD 
IS LESS 
THAN 
LAST YEAR WHERE AS LAST 
YEAR ALL 
THE 
PARTIES WERE 
TALKING ABOUT 
GREEN ISSUES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF 
BRINGING 
IN GREEN 
TAXES TO HELP THE 
ENVIRONMENT ALL THAT'S NOW GONE 
FROM THE POLITICAL AGENDA 
BUT THE LIB DEMS AND LABOUR DISMISS 
MR. CAMERON'S PLEDGE TO BE A GOOD 
HOUSEKEEPER BY CHARGING HIM ONCE 
AGAIN WITH LACK OF SPECIFICS IT IT WAS UTTERLY EMPTY AND VACUOUS IF 
THE CONSERVATIVES REALLY WANT TO BE 
TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS A PARTY OF 
GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE TO SPELL OUT 
MUCH MORE CONCRETELY WHAT THEIR 
TAX PROPOSALS ARE IF THEY 
GOING TO CUT TAX ON STAMP DUTY 
SHARES FOR EXAMPLE WHICH THEY 
PROMISE TO DO AND NOT INCREASE 
VEHICLE EXCISE DUTY THEY HAVE TO 
EXPLAIN WHERE THE MONEY IS COMING 
FROM 
WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO IS ABY FROM SOME MIRACULOUS PROCESS HE'S NOT 
GOING TO TELL US ABOUT HE WILL 
HAVE ALL THAT EXTRA MONEY OR HEALTH 
AND THE ARMED FORCES AND DRUGS FOR 
STROKE VIM IT IS WHAT HE'S COMING 
OUT IS FRANKLY THIS FORMULA YOU 
WOULD HAVE TO BE A MUG TO FALL FOR 
NOBODY IN THIS COUNTRY BUYS 
ANYTHING SIGHT UNSEEN HE'S SAYING 
TRUST US WE'RE THE CONSERVATIVES 
WE WON'T TELL YOU WHERE THE MONEY 
IS COMING FROM BUT IT WILL COME 
BUT VOTERS SEEM TO FIND THE CAMERON 
DISH RATHER MORE APPETISING THAN 
OTHERS THEY HAVE SEEN AT LEAST 
ACCORDING TO THE LATEST POLL IN 
CREWE AND NANTWICH IT SUGGESTS THE 
CONSERVATIVES WILL WIN THERE WITH 
EASE THIS WEEK THE POLL SHOWS A 
THIRTEEN PER CENT LEAD OVER LABOUR 
SOMETHING STRANGELY UNCONVINCING 
ABOUT THAT VISUAL METAPHOR OF 
MICHAEL CRICK IN THE KITCHEN 
EARLIER THIS WEEK I SPOKE TO THE 
SHADOW MINISTER TO THE TREASURY I 
ASKED HIM WHERE HIS PARTY WOULD KUM 
CUT IN THE GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
PLANS 
WE ARE TO ALLOW THE STATE TO GROW 
MORE SLOWLY THAN THE ECONOMY 
OVERALL THAT WILL REDUCE BORROWING 
AND ALLOW US TO FUND PUBLIC 
SERVICES PROPERLY 
THE KEY THING IS THIS THE PUBLIC 
IS NO LONGER PREPARED TO ACCEPT IT 
HAS TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN LOWER 
TAX BURDENS AND GOOD QUALITY PUBLIC 
SERVICES IT IS ASKING ITS 
POLITICIANS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO 
DELIVER US BOTH DAVID CAMERON HAS 
SET OUT AN OUTLINE OF OUR THINKING 
ON HOW WE ARE TO MOVE FORWARD 
WHAT OUGHT TO BE THE TAX BURDEN AS 
A PROPER PORTION OF THE G. D. P. 
I WILL 
NOT SET OUT A THREE LOGICAL 
PERCENTAGE OF G. D. P. 
SHOULD IT BE HIGHER OR LOWER IT IT SHOULD BE LOWER 
THAT IS UNDER 
THIRTY SIX POINT EIGHT PER CENT 
THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS AS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT PER CENT THE ECONOMY GROWS WE WILL NOT ALLOW 
PUBLIC SPENDING TO GROW AS QUICKLY 
AS THE OVERALL ECONOMY GROWS 
SO IT SHOULD BE LOWER IT WILL BE 
GRADUAL PROCESS BUT OVER TIME THE 
STATE WILL TAKE SMALLER SHARE OF 
NATIONAL INCOME THAT MEAN THERE IS 
IS A BIGGER SHARE FOR THE 
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO SPEND 
THEMSELVES NOW WE HAVE REACHED THE 
POINT WHERE THE PUBLIC HAS REACHED 
THE LIMIT OF ITS TOLERANCE IN TERMS 
OF THE TAX BURDEN THEY WANT US TO 
SET OUT HOW WE WILL DELIVER HIGH 
QUALITY PUBLIC SERVICES WHILE 
GETTING THE TAXES DOWN TO A LEVEL 
THAT ARE COMPETITIVE SO THAT 
BRITAIN CAN GO ON BEING COMPETITIVE 
THE CLAIM HE MAKES IS THAT SOMEHOW 
YOU ARE TO FUND THIS OUT OF GROWTH 
BECAUSE THE ECONOMY WILL GROW 
FASTER THAN THE RATE OF THE 
TAXATION GROWING 
THE ECONOMY AS 
IT GROWS WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE 
SIZE OF GOVERNMENT GROWS MORE 
SLOWLY THAN THE ECONOMY OVERALL A A BIT OF A PROBLEM WHEN GROWTH IS 
PROJECTED TO SLOW ISN'T IT THIS THIS IS OVER AN ECONOMIC CYCLE ARE ARE YOU FINDING A AN ECONOMIC CYCLE 
ARE YOU DEFINING AN ECONOMIC CYCLE 
WE KNOW WHAT AN ECONOMIC CYCLE IT 
COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO US WHAT IS AN 
ECONOMIC CYCLE 
IT IS OVER THE 
CYCLE WHERE WE HAVE ECONOMIC GROWTH 
FASTER THAN THE TREND RATE OF 
GROWTH CLOSING THE OUTPUT GAP 
THEN THERE IS A PERIOD WHEN THE 
OUTPUT GAP IS WIDENING 
ARE WE TO START ONE OF THE CYCLES 
IT IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY WHERE WE 
ARE IN RELATION TO THE NEXT 
ECONOMIC CYCLE THAT IS SOMETHING 
THAT THE STATISTICIANS WILL TELL US 
AFTER THE EVENT 
SO AFTER THE EVENT SO SOMEBODY 
AFTER THE EVENT WILL TELL YOU WHERE 
YOU WERE IN THE ECONOMIC CYCLE SO 
YOU CAN MAKE A PREDICTION ABOUT 
GROWTH THE PREDICTION YOU MAKE ON 
GROWTH 
YES A TREND RATE OF GROWTH GROWTH OVER THE ECONOMIC CYCLE THE TREND 
RATE WILL GROW THERE WILL BE A 
CURVE WHERE IT IS GROWING FOR PART 
OF THE TIME MORE SLOWLY THAN THE 
TREND RATE AND FOR PART OF THE TIME 
MORE QUICKLY THAN THE TREND RATE 
YOU KEEP GOING ON ABOUT THE CYCLE 
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VIEWERS WHO 
MAY BE SLIGHTLY CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT 
THE CYCLE IS CAN YOU TELL US 
ROUGHLY WHERE WE ARE IN IT AND 
ROUGHLY WHEN THE CYCLE BEGAN AND 
ROUGHLY WHEN IT WILL END SO WE CAN 
GET A PICTURE OF WHAT YOU ARE 
TALKING ABOUT OR DON'T YOU KNOW I I CAN'T TELL YOU WHEN THE ECONOMIC 
CYCLE WILL END 
YOU DON'T KNOW 
NO I DON'T NOR 
DOES ANYONE ELSE 
GET A PANEL OF ECONOMISTS AND ASK 
THEM WHEN THE ECONOMIC CYCLE WILL 
END SOME MAY HAZARD A GUESS SOME 
WILL KNOW 
BUT THEY ARE NOT TELLING US HOW TO 
FIX THE ECONOMY YOU ARE 
THEY 
THERE IS NOTHING 
IN WHAT YOU HAVE SAID THAT 
UNDERMINES THE PRINCIPLE THAT LOOKS 
AT SHARING THE PROCEEDS OF THE 
ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER THE ECONOMIC 
CYCLE IT MAY BE FIVE OR TEN YEARS 
BUT THERE WILL BE ECONOMIC GROWTH 
WE WILL ENSURE THAT AT THE END OF 
THE CYCLE THE STATE IS CONSUMERING 
A CONSUMING A SMALLER PROPORS OF 
OUR NATIONAL INCOME THAN IT WAS AT 
THE BEGINNING THAT WILL ALLOW US 
TO REDUCE THE BORROWING OR TAXES OR 
BOTH AND AT THE SAME TIME FUND THE 
PUBLIC SERVICES IN A WAY THAT IS 
SUSTAINABLE SO WE CAN ENJOY 
COMPETITIVE TAXES AND HIGH QUALITY 
SERVICES

DIFFICULT AS MANY OTHER JOBS IN

RATHER THE ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS 
BECOME THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN OF 
JUST ABOUT NERCH THE TOWN TRUMPING 
EVERYTHING EVEN THE WAR IN IRAQ 
TAKE THIS STREET HERE THE RETAIL 
HERE IS DOWN THIRTY PER CENT FROM CHRISTMAS 
THREE SHOPS HAVE CLOSED IN THE LAST 
FEW MONTHS THIS ONE HERE JUST A 
FEW WEEKS AGO ALTHOUGH THE ECONOMY 
IS SUCH A BIG CONCERN WHAT THE 
VOTERS OF CULPEPER ARE NOT HEARING 
FROM ANY OF THE CANDIDATES SO FAR 
ARE REAL RECIPES ABOUT HOW TO FIX 
THE CRISIS 
OH THIS MORNING 
WHEN I ROSE 
YEAH NUMBER LOUISE IS HAIRDRESSER 
FROM MONDAY TO SATURDAY SUNDAY SHE 
IS A DIVA FOR GOD IN HER LOCAL 
CHURCH CHURCH IT IS DEEP IN THE CID FIFTEEN MILES 
FROM CULPEPER 
DEEP IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
IT IS AN ASTONISHING CHURCH 
BRIMMING HERE ARE SOFT CONFIDENCE 
AND REAL TALENT THE VOICE 
RESONATES WITH CONFIDENCE WITH 
HOPE THE HAIR DRESSING SALON HAS 
NOT FELT THE RECESSION THE 
PIRATESS ARE CHEAP THE CUSTOMERS 
GROWING OLD WITH HER YOU MAY THINK 
THAT LOUISE IS MATE RACK 
MATRIARCH WHO WOULD WELCOME 
WOMAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE YOU WOULD 
BE IN THERE 
A WOMAN IS NOT THE HEAD OF NOTHING 
YOU ARE THE HEAD OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD 
AREN'T YOU 
I WOULD DISAGREE WITH 
THAT 
YOU ARE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO THAT BE BE ALMOST EVERYONE HERE IS HOPING AND 
PRAYING THAT BARACK OBAMA WILL BE 
THE CANDIDATE AND THEN GO ALL THE 
WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE BUT THEY 
CAN'T QUITE BELIEVE IT 
IT IS NOT 
THE POINT HE IS BLACK BUT I AM 
GLAD TO HAVE SOMEONE DIFFERENT L. 
AM GLAD TO HAVE AN AFRO AMERICA 
IS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THAT IS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT WE ARE MOSTLY 
IN THE BACK 
WE ARE IN THE BACK 
STILL 
YES GOOD LORD 
BETSY SMITH STILL THE MINISTER SINCE WE LAST SPOKE 
TO BETSY FEW THINGS HAVE 
HAPPENED SHE SPENT TWO WEEKS IN 
SOUTH AFRICA ON MISSIONARY WORK IT 
MADE HER REALISE THAT LIFE NEXT TO 
THE NEW FAMILY CZECH STILL 
COMFORTABLE WHAT SHE WORRIES ABOUT 
MOST ARE THE MORAL CHOICES OFFERED 
BY THE ELECTIONS BETSY IS A SOLID 
REPUBLICAN BUT NOT HAPPY ONE 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH JOHN MCCAIN NOT NOT THRILLED THRILLED THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN UNDERSTATEMENT 
NO I KNOW I AM NOT HAPPY WITH HIM 
BUT HAPPIER THAN WITH HIM THAN 
WITH THE OTHER TWO 
IS THERE NO WAY YOU WOULD SWITCH 
NO NO LET ME HEAR YOU SAY 
EVERYTHING'S O. K. 
I GOT JESUS IN MY LIFE THIS IS 
ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF BETSY'S 
WEEK TEACHING SUNDAY SCHOOL AT THE 
CULPEPER BAPTIST CHURCH THE 
MESSAGE IS CLEAR KEEPING THE FAITH 
UP UP BETSY SEES THE WORLD THROUGH THE 
PRIS M. OF HER FAITH SHE STILL 
ADOERS PRESIDENT BUSH BECAUSE HE 
BROUGHT GOD INTO THE WHITE HOUSE 
WHAT BOTH ERTS HER ABOUT THE 
TODAY'S CANDIDATES IS IS IF SHE 
CAN LIVE BY THE BIBLE WHY CAN'T 
THEY 
I PRAY A LOT ABOUT IT THERE THEY IS A WAY THAT SEEMS RIGHT TO MAN 
BUT IT IS IN LEAGUE TO DESTRUCTION 
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT A LOT OF 
THINGS WHEN YOU HEAR THEM SEEM 
RIGHT I DON'T HEAR ANYMORE OF 
ANY OF THEM REALLY LOOKING TO GOD 
TO THE SCRIPT TOWERS TO FIND OUT 
WHAT REALLY IS RIGHT 
MOST OF CULL PEP SER TOO PRE 
OCCUPIED TO BE DISTRACTED BY THE 
WHITE NOISE OF THE CAMPAIGN MOST 
ARE TOO CYNICAL TO EXPECT A 
CANDIDATE TO LIVE UP TO THEIR 
PROMISES BUT AS BARACK OBAMA IS 
POISED TO SQUARE OFF AGAINST JOHN 
MCCAIN THEY WILL BEGIN TO PAY CLOSE 
ATTENTION THEY WILL WANT TO HEAR 
PLAUSIBLE ANSWERS THEN ONE DAY 
PROBABLY WHEN THE AUTUMN LEAVES 
BEGIN TO TURN THEY WILL MAKE UP 
THEIR MIND 
YOU CAN SEE MORE ALL OF THAT
