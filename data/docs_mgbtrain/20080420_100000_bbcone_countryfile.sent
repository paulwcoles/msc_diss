FIFTEEN HUNDRED ACRES ARE BEING PLANTED ON THE 
FARM AT THE MOMENT THEY ARE USING 
THE VERY LATEST IN SATELLITE 
TECHNOLOGY 
HI MATT HI JOHN 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT HERE 
WE HAVE A 
SATELLITE GUIDANCE SYSTEM WHICH 
ALLOWS US TO DRIVE IN A DEAD 
STRAIGHT LINE ACROSS THE FIELD 
WITH ALL THE TRACTORS FOLLOWING ME 
THEY CAN FOLLOW IN EXACT LINE DEAD DEAD STRAIGHT TRACKS YEAH 
ARE YOU YEAH ACTUALLY DRIVING NO 
THE SATELLITE NO IS DOING IT FOR YOU YES 
THAT MUST YES FEEL STRANGE 
WE GET USED TO IT 
CAN YOU SHOW ME HOW IT WORKS 
CERTAINLY 
THIS IS A BIT ODD ISN'T CERTAINLY IT WILL IT CORRECT ITSELF SHOULD 
YOU ACCIDENTALLY SENT IT OFF 
COURSE YES 
THERE WE GO A YARD OR SO TO THE 
RIGHT AND THE SAT NAV BRINGS 
STRAIGHT AGAIN BRINGS US 
STRAIGHT AGAIN 
THAT IS FASCINATING ROBERT BUT 
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE A 
DEAD STRAIGHT FURROW 
BY HAVING THE 
DEAD STRAIGHT FURROW MATT IS ABLE 
TO GUIDE THE OTHER TRACTORS THAT 
COME INTO THE FIELD SO WE HAVE A 
CONTROLLED WHEELING SYSTEM SO ALL 
OF THE TRACTORS RUN ON THE SAME 
WHEEL TRACK AND THE POTATOES ARE 
THEN PLANTED INTO FREE SOIL IN 
UNDER A HAVE IN IDEAL GROWING 
CONDITIONS ARE 
NOT SOIL IMPACTED 
BY WHEELS AND THINGS 
THAT IS IT 
WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST SOIL IN 
THE U. K. PEAT SOIL THERE IS A BIT 
OF PLAY WITH THEM WHICH MAKES AN 
IDEAL GROWING MEDIUM 
A BIT OF 
CLAY THE BULK OF THIS CROP IS 
DESTINED FOR FISH AND CHIP SHOPS 
OR POTATO FARMERS ARE HOPING THERE 
WILL NOT BE A REPEAT OF LAST 
SUMMER'S FLOODS WHICH DEVASTATED 
HARVESTS WHAT AFFECTS THE CLIMATE 
CHANGE HAVE ON GLOBAL PRODUCTION 
OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS MODELS 
WOULD INDICATE THAT POTATO YIELDS 
THROUGH MOST OF THE WORLD WILL 
DECREASE BUT WE WILL SEE AN 
INCREASE IN POTATO YIELDS IN THE 
NORTHERN AND VERY SOUTHERN 
LATITUDES 
WHICH WILL BE DRIER LATITUDES DRIER AND WARMER CERTAINLY AS FAR 
AS THE U. K. IS CONCERNED WE ARE 
PREDICTING LOW YIELDS IN ENGLAND 
BUT HIGHER YIELDS IN SCOTLAND AND AND THE POTATO FARMERS OF EAST ANGLIA 
MIGHT HAVE TO UP STICKS AND MOVE 
TOWARDS SCOTLAND THEN 
WELL IT 
COULD WELL BE POTATO PRODUCTION 
WILL MOVE NORTH 
RABBITS ARE AN 
INTEGRAL PART OF THE COUNTRYSIDE 
YET TO FARMERS AND LANDOWNERS 
THEY ARE THE BIGGEST PEST IN 
BRITISH AGRICULTURE BUT IS THAT 
REALLY TRUE MIRIAM HAS THIS REPORT 
THIS CUTE LITTLE BUNNY IS SAFE IN 
HIS SUBURBAN HUTCH HE HARDLY LOOKS 
LIKE A MENACE TO SOCIETY YET A 
CONSTANT BATTLE IS BEING WAGED 
AGAINST HIS COUNTRY COUSINS SEEN 
AS ONE OF RURAL BRITAIN'S BIGGEST 
PESTS RABBITS MAY SEEM TO HAVE 
BEEN PART OF THE COUNTRYSIDE FOR 
EVER BUT THEY WERE ACTUALLY 
INTRODUCED BY THE NORMANS IN THE 
TWELFTH CENTURY WARRENS WERE CREATED 
FOR THEM TO LIVE IN SO THEY COULD 
BE EXTENSIVELY FARMED FOR THEIR 
MEAT NOWADAYS WILD RABBITS MAY 
HAVE THE CUTE AND FLUFFY IMAGE BUT 
THEIR DESTRUCTIVE HABITS CAUSED ALL 
SORTS OF TROUBLE IN FACT THE 
BRITISH GOVERNMENT REGARDS RABBITS 
AS THE MAJOR PEST IN BRITISH 
AGRICULTURE AND THE MASSIVE CAUSE 
FOR CONCERN THERE ARE AROUND THIRTY SEVEN 
MILLION OF THEM IN THE COUNTRY 
THEIR NUMBERS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE 
GROWING BY TWO PER CENT PER YEAR THEY ARE 
COSTING FARMERS AND LANDOWNERS A 
WHOPPING ONE HUNDRED MILLION PER YEAR 
FARM MANAGER GRAHAM BOYT HAS SEEN 
THE KIND OF DAMAGE RABBITS CAN DO 
HOW MANY RABBITS DO YOU HAVE ON THE 
FARM 
IT WOULD BE HARD TO SAY FARM BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE ON THE SURFACE 
WOULD ONLY BE TEN PER CENT OF THE 
POPULATION BUT WE REGULARLY SEE TEN 
TO FIFTEEN RABBITS PER FIELD IF WE HAVE 
THIRTY ODD FIELDS THAT IS A LOT OF 
RABBITS IN A SMALL SPACE 
IS THIS 
CONSTANT 
IT IS CONSTANT ALL YEAR CONSTANT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR WHEN THE 
YOUNG ARE COMING OUT IT CAN BE FORTY 
OR FIFTY TWENTY ADULTS AND LOTS OF LITTLE 
ONES IT 
IS A LOT OF RABBITS 
THIS THIS IS THE DAMAGE THEY DO THIS IS THE 
TYPE OF THING YOU GET A RABBIT 
HOLE AND THEN SOIL EROSION ROUND IT 
THEN THE WARREN COLLAPSES AND THERE 
IS A GOOD EXAMPLE TO OUR LEFT AND 
THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IF YOU ARE 
ON A BIKE OR A TRACTOR AND YOUR 
WHEEL GOES DOWN THERE IT IS EASY 
TO TIP THE VEHICLE OVER AND CAUSED 
A LARGE ACCIDENT 
HOW MUCH DO YOU 
THINK IT IS COSTING YOU EVERY YEAR 
FOR SMALL FARM LIKE THIS ONLY 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY HECTARES IT WOULD RUN INTO 
THOUSANDS OF POUNDS WE PAY A 
CONTRACT OR TO DEAL WITH SOME OF 
THE RABBITS WE HAVE STAFF WHO SUED 
THEM A CONTRACTOR EVEN A 
SHOTGUN CARTRIDGE IS NOT SURE CHEAP 
WHO SHOULD THEM IT MOUNTS UP 
RABBITS ALSO EAT CROPS THE BEST 
PART OF A FIELD CAN BE DEVOUT 
OVERNIGHT THERE WARRENS ALSO 
UNDERMINED RAILWAYS AND DAMAGE GOLF 
COURSES GRAVEYARDS AND 
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES RABBITS WERE 
CLASSED AS PESTS AS FAR BACK AS 
NINETEEN THIRTY NINE THE SITUATION WAS SO BAD IN 
NINETEEN FIFTY TWO THAT THE DEVASTATING DISEASE 
MYXOMATOSIS WAS DELIBERATELY 
RELEASED INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE 
PRACTICALLY WIPING OUT THE U. K. 
RABBIT POPULATION BUT NUMBERS HAVE 
EXPLODED IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE 
YEARS AND RABBIT NUMBERS HAVE TO BE 
CONTROLLED IT IS THE LAW A 
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT METHODS ARE 
USED IN AN ATTEMPT TO KEEP RABBIT 
NUMBERS DOWN HERE FERRETS ARE 
FITTED WITH RADIO TRANSMITTERS ARE 
FLASHING FLUSHING RABBITS OUT OF 
THEIR WARRENS AND INTO NEXT AND BOX 
TRAPS THEY ARE THEN SOLD TO LOCAL 
BUTCHERS FOR MEAT 
I THINK THIS IS 
THE MOST HUMANE WAY OF KILLING 
RABBITS IT MUST BE A HORRIBLE 
DEATH BUT THIS IS QUICK WITHIN A 
FRACTION OF THE SECOND THEY ARE 
DEAD A FRACTION OF A SECOND 
YOU MUST HAVE CAUGHT THOUSANDS OF 
RABBITS DURING YOUR LIFE I I COULDN'T COUNT THOUSANDS AND 
THOUSANDS WE AVERAGE IN THE LAST 
FEW YEARS BETWEEN FOUR TO FIVE THOUSAND 
RABBITS PER YEAR FOUR THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND 
HOW BIG PROBLEM ARE RABBITS IN 
THE COUNTRYSIDE 
IT IS BECOMING A 
MASSIVE PROBLEM FOR A NUMBER OF 
REASONS MILDER WINTERS ARE NOT 
KILLING OF THE POPULATIONS STOPPED 
TRADITIONALLY TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO 
VILLAGES WOULD HAVE A LOCAL RABBIT 
CATCHER THERE ARE VERY FEW NOW 
THIS YEAR MORE THAN EVER BEFORE 
THE PRICE OF WHEAT ARE RISING THE 
FIELDS ARE BEING EATEN UP WHAT WHAT NUMBER OF RABBITS ARE YOU CATCHING 
THOUSANDS EVERY YEAR MYXOMATOSIS 
HAS NOT PLAYED ITS ROLE RECENTLY 
IT HAS NOT TAKEN RABBIT NUMBERS 
DOWN LIKE IT WOULD HAVE DONE IN THE 
SIXTIES MOST OF SURVIVING RABBITS ARE 
BREEDING ALL YEAR ROUND NOW BUT BUT ARE RABBITS REALLY THE PROBLEM THEY 
ARE MADE OUT TO BE AT THE 
UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA A TWENTY FIVE 
YEAR STUDY HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT 
MONITORING AND NATURAL RABBIT 
POPULATION AND THE RESULTS MAKE 
SURPRISE THOSE WHO THINK THEY ARE 
JUST A PROBLEM THAT HAS TO BE 
CONTROLLED MAY'S SURPRISE TO 
STOP DOCTOR DIANA BELL WHO HAS BEEN 
CARRYING GOT THE STUDY THINKS IT 
IS TIME FOR AN IMAGE MAKEOVER 
FIRST THERE IS MYTH THAT 
MYXOMATOSIS IS NO LONGER EFFECTIVE 
AS RABBIT CONTROL AGENT THAT 
RABBITS ARE SOMEHOW IMMUNE TO IT 
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE WE 
HAVE GOT TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF DATA AND 
EVERY YEAR MYXOMATOSIS COMES 
THROUGH THE POPULATION IT KILLS 
BETWEEN SIXTY AND ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF THOSE 
BABIES EVERY YEAR 
ANOTHER RABBIT 
MYTH ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BELL IS THE 
NUMBER OF YOUNG THEY PRODUCE 
ABOUT SIXTY PEOPLE SAY 
THE MOST WE 
HAVE EVER HAD AND THAT IS WITH AN 
EARLY START TO BREEDING THE FIRST 
BABIES EMERGING IN FEBRUARY THE 
MOST RABBITS WE HAVE EVER HAD PER 
DOH PER YEAR HAS BEEN BETWEEN SIX 
AND TEN AT THE MOMENT WE ARE DOWN 
TO ONE OR TWO PER FEMALE RABBIT PER 
YEAR THE POPULATION SELLERS SIZE 
HAS GONE DOWN FROM ONE HUNDRED ADULTS DO 
ABOUT THIRTY 
THERE IS A LOT OF DAMAGE 
HERE FROM RABBITS 
I WOULDN'T CALL 
THIS DAMAGE L. WOULD CALL IT RABBIT ACTIVITY WHAT THEY HAVE PRODUCED 
IS A NICE SHORT SPECIES RICH 
FIELD WHICH BUTTERFLIES WILL BREED 
IN THEY HAD ALSO THEIR GRAZING 
HAS PRODUCED NETTLES WHICH YOU 
FIND LOTS OF BUTTERFLIES IN WE 
HAVE GOT THE ORCHIDS WHICH WE 
DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE WE HAVE ADDED 
IN THE AREA RABBITS HAVE INCREASE 
IT INCREASED BIODIVERSITY PER 
STOP THE CONSTRUCTIVE SIDE OF 
RABBITS IS PUT TO GOOD USE AT 
WEETING HEAT WEETING HEATH IN 
NORFOLK NORFOLK IT IS A DIFFERENT STORY HERE WE 
NEED RABBITS THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO 
THE ECOLOGY OF THE HEATH ALL THE 
RABBITS ARE FENCED IN SO THEY CAN'T 
GET OUT DELIBERATELY ABSOLUTELY DELIBERATELY ABSOLUTELY THE STONE CURLEW RARE BREEDING 
BIRD HAS SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE RABBIT THE STONE CURLEW 
LIKES TO NEST ON THE BARE AREAS THE 
RABBIT CREATES WHEN IT IS DIGGING 
IN THE SOIL RABBITS ARE REALLY 
IMPORTANT FOR KEEPING THE GRASS 
HEATH IN PRISTINE CONDITION THE 
AREA IN FRONT AT THE MOMENT IS SOME 
OF THE BEST LIKEN HEATH YOU CAN 
FIND 
RABBITS ARE GETTING GOOD FIND PRESS AS GOOD AS BAD BUT IT WILL 
TAKE A LOT OF GREAT P. R. IF THEY ARE 
TO LOSE THEIR IMAGE AS ONE OF THE 
FARMER'S BIGGEST ENEMIES 
TO ME IT 
IS TIME FOR AN IMAGE MAKEOVER THE 
ONLY GOOD RABBIT WAS A DEAD RABBIT 
ACTUALLY RABBITS HAVE NEVER 
RECOVERED FROM MYXOMATOSIS AND 
THERE IS STILL A FRACTION OF THE 
POPULATION THERE WAS BEFORE 
MYXOMATOSIS 
THE RABBIT POPULATION MYXOMATOSIS HAS TO BE CONTROLLED MYXOMATOSIS 
AND A FEW FOXES ARE NOT GOING TO 
KEEP THE NUMBERS IN CHECK RABBITS RABBITS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE 
BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE BUT BECAUSE 
THEY ARE PROLIFIC BREEDERS THEIR 
NUMBERS WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO BE 
CONTROLLED EITHER BY PREDATORS 
DISEASE OR BY MAN SO IT IS A CASE 
OF RUN RABBIT RUN 
TODAY I AM IN EAST ANGLIA AND 
NORFOLK IS RENOWNED FOR ITS FLAT 
LANDSCAPE BROADS AND MARSH DYKES 
THERE IS A BIT OF A NORFOLK IN 
NORTH DEVON BROUGHTON MARSH WAS 
MUDFLATS UNTIL ENCLOSED AT THE 
START OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT WAS 
TURNED INTO PRIME FARMLAND USING 
DYKES FROM OUR VIDEO DIARY LESS 
MEAT ROLAND DIBBLE THE KEEPER OF 
THE SLUICE ON THE MARSH AT HIS FARM 
THAT TIME FORGOT 
I AM A ROLAND DIBBLE I AM A BEEF 
FARMER IN NORTH DEVON BESIDES 
BEING FARMER I HAVE ALSO GOT A 
SPECIAL JOB ON THE BROUGHT IN MARCH 
THERE IS SIXTEEN MILES OF DYKES ON THE 
MARSHES IT ACTS AS A FENCE FOR THE 
CATTLE TO KEEP THEM IN THE FIELDS 
AND SUPPLIES DRINKING WATER AND 
GOOD GRAZING IN NINETEEN TEN THE BANK 
BURST ON THE MARSHES ALL THE SHEEP 
AND CATTLE WERE DROWNED THE ONLY 
SURVIVING THING WAS RABBITS WHICH 
THEY ARE FOUND UP A TREE THREE 
RABBITS MY JOB I MANAGE THE 
SLUICE GATES MANAGED TO KEEP 
FRESH WATER IN RISE OR LOWER IT 
AND TO KEEP THE SALT WATER OUT 
I COME DOWN HERE FAIRLY REGULARLY 
TO CHECK THIS WATER L. HAVE COME 
DOWN NOW TO PUT IN ANOTHER PLANK 
BECAUSE I THINK THE WATER HAS GONE 
DOWN A BIT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY 
THE WATER CANNOT GET AWAY OUT OF 
THE MASTERS AND IT IS MOST 
ESSENTIAL TO KEEP THE PLANKS HIGHER 
OR LOWER OR WHATEVER THE MARSHES 
I THINK THIS SLUICE IS A VERY VERY 
GOOD DESIGN NOW I AM GOING BACK TO 
THE LAND ROVER TO PUT ON MY WADERS 
AND 
I WILL SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS I WILL GO INSIDE NOW THROUGH THE TUNNEL 
THIS IS ALL FRESHWATER COMING OUT 
FROM THE MARSHES NOW YOU HAVE TO 
WALK CAREFULLY BECAUSE THESE STONES 
GET VERY SLIPPERY AT THE MOMENT 
WE HAD TWO PLANKS IN THERE WE ARE 
TAKING ONE OUT OR PUTTING ONE IN 
THAT MAKES THE WORLD OF DIFFERENCE 
TO THE LEVEL OF THE WATER ON THE 
MARSH I GET BIT WORRIED ABOUT NO 
YOUNG MAN IS TAKING ON THESE JOBS 
BECAUSE WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE 
DRAINAGE BOARD ONE IS EIGHTY SIX YEARS OLD 
ONE IS EIGHTY FIVE L. AM COMING UP TO EIGHTY IN 
TIME I AM WORRIED HE WILL TAKE ON 
THESE JOBS THAT IS THAT JOB DONE 
THE MARSHES WILL BE ALL RIGHT NOW 
FOR ANOTHER WEEK CAN GO HOME AND SLEEP TONIGHT 
THINK OF WHISKY AND YOU THINK OF 
SCOTLAND OR MAYBE IRELAND WILD 
RUGGED LANDSCAPES DEEP MISTY 
GLENS AND FAST FLOWING RIVERS YOU 
CERTAINLY WOULD NOT THINK OF THIS 
GENTLE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE WITH A 
SLEEPY RIVER GLIDING PAST REEDS 
AND RUSHES WHAT HAS THIS TO DO 
WITH WHISKY THE ANSWER IS ACROSS 
THERE IT IS THE ONLY ENGLISH 
WHISKY DISTILLERY THE LAST ONE 
CLOSED MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO 
THIS OPENED LAST YEAR COSTING ONE 
OVER WELL OVER A MILLION POUNDS 
AND IS IS THE IDEA OF A NORFOLK 
FARMING FAMILY HOW MANY BARRELS 
ARE IN HERE 
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED WHICH IS 
WHAT IS EFFECTIVELY WON A YEAR'S 
PRODUCTION A LOT OF WHISKY SOME 
WILL BE HIT THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS MANY MANY FARMERS ARE DIVERSE AS TO FIND 
DIVERSIFIED BUT A DISTILLERY THE THE FARMER ALWAYS DREAMED OF DOING A 
DISTILLERY NOT ENVISAGE ON THIS 
SCALE BUT ONCE WE STARTED THERE 
SEEMS NO POINT IN HALF MEASURES 
WHAT WHISKY IS IT 
WE MAKE TWO 
DIFFERENT WHISKIES SINGLE MALTS 
WHISKY WE DO A PITTED AND PLAIN 
THE ANCIENT CELTS ARE THOUGHT TO BE 
THE FIRST TO MAKE WHISKY THEY 
CALLED IT WATER OF LIFE OVER 
CENTURIES THE PROCESS HAS NOT 
REALLY CHANGED ARE YOU MAKING 
WHISKY AT THE MOMENT 
YEAH WE HAVE 
THE WASH RUNNING AT THE MOMENT THE 
SPIRIT IS RUNNING WHICH IS THE 
SECOND TIME WE DISTIL WHISKY IS 
MAKING AT THE MOMENT SHALL I SHOW 
YOU 
YES PLEASE 
WHAT WE'RE DOING YOU IS WE HAVE EIGHT MASH AND IT IS 
ESSENTIALLY MAKING BEER THIS 
STARTS THE PROCESS IN THIS VESSEL 
WE TAKE THE MALTED BARLEY AND CRUSH 
IT UP IN A MILL 
LOCAL BARLEY THIS THIS IS WHAT WE CALL GRIST GRIST TO THE 
MILL THESE WERE CHUNKS ARE 
BASICALLY THE STARCH STARCH IS 
SUGAR WE ARE BREAKING THE STARCH 
DOWN IN ORDER TO MAKE THE SUGAR 
ACCESSIBLE AND FERMENTABLE 
A NICE 
MAN 
IT IS A MULTI TOFFEE SNUFF MAN NICE SMELL 
HERE WE HAVE THE 
LIQUID WE PRODUCED IN THE MASH TOM 
WE HAVE ADDED YEAST AND IT IS A 
FERMENTING 
WHAT'S NEXT 
WE TAKE FERMENTING THE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THE RUBBER 
BIT DISTILL IT OFF AND DISTIL IT 
SECOND TIME IN THE SPIRIT STILL IT IT LOOKS LIKE WATER 
YES YOU WOULD 
NOT THINK IT WOULD BE WHISKY THIS 
IS THE LIQUID WE HAVE SEEN THIS IS 
WHAT WHISKY LOOKS LIKE BEFORE THIS 
IS SIXTY THREE PER CENT ALCOHOL YOU ARE WELCOME TO 
TRY IT A SPLASH OF WATER GIVE IT 
A SWIRL AROUND IT IS NOT WHISKY 
OH IT IS NICE IT DOES NOT LOOK 
LIKE WHISKY BUT IT TASTES LIKE 
WHISKY THE SPIRIT WILL SIT IN THE 
BARRELS FOR THREE YEARS AND THAT IS 
HOW IT ACQUIRES ITS CHARACTERISTIC 
COLOUR THE FIRST BOTTLES OF 
ENGLISH WHISKY GO ON AT CHRISTMAS 
NEXT YEAR SHOULD THE SCOTS BE 
WORRIED 
I DO NOT THINK SO IT WORRIED MIGHT BE A FEW GENERATIONS BEFORE 
WE CAN COMPETE WITH THEM THE THE SCENERY OF THE LAKE DISTRICT COULD 
NOT BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN HERE IN 
EAST ANGLIA IT HAS MAGNIFICENT 
MOUNTAINS VALLEYS AND THE LAKES 
THERE ARE THAT STRETCHES OF WATER 
WHICH ARE WELL WORTH SEEKING OUT 
CLIMBING MOUNTAINS OVER THREE THOUSAND F. T. IN 
THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS IS HUGELY 
POPULAR TRADITIONALLY YOU CLIMB 
THE MOUNTAIN AND ADDED TO YOUR LIST 
APPARENTLY THERE IS MORE 
MYSTERIOUS CHALLENGE GROWING IN 
POPULARITY BAGGING THE TIMES 
THESE ARE THE SMALL LAKES OVER THE 
FELLS I COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN 
BETTER DAY TO GUIDE ME TO MY FIRST 
TIME I HAVE COME TO SEE JOHN AND AN 
UTTER WHAT IS TIME 
IT COMES 
FROM NORSE AND MEANS SMALL MOUNTAIN 
LAKE HOW MANY ARE THERE IN THE 
FELLS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE IT DEPENDS WHAT 
YOU CALL A TARN SOME PEOPLE SAY IT 
A TARN IS ONE WITH A NAME AND IT 
SHOULD NOT BE TOO SMALL OR SHOULD 
HAVE A PERMANENT OUTFLOW WHATEVER 
RAW YOU CHOOSE THERE IS ALWAYS 
SOME TARN THAT DOES NOT FIT THE 
RULES ON A DAY LIKE THIS YOU'LL 
FIND SOME FANTASTIC LITTLE TARN 
HOW TO GO ABOUT BACKING A TARN IT IT IS UP TO YOU YOU CAN PUT YOUR HAND 
OR FOOT IN IT PADDLE OR JUST TAKE 
A PHOTO THERE ARE NO RULES 
HERE WE ARE THERE IS YOUR FIRST 
TARN TARN HOWS 
WOW IT IS LOVELY 
TRUE WILDERNESS LOOK AT THE 
ORDNANCE SURVEY MAP AND YOU WILL 
NOT FIND TARN HOWS IT IS LISTED AS 
THE TIMES BECAUSE IT IS THREE 
SEPARATE TARN THE LANDOWNER 
FLOODED THE VALLEY AND THERE WERE 
TWO REASONS WHY TO SUPPLY WATER TO 
A LOCAL SAWMILL AND TO CREATE A 
PLACE OF BEAUTY 
I CAME I SAW AND NOW I HAVE TO BAG 
MY FIRST TARN THE WATER IS A 
FROZEN I WILL SKIN A STONE SKIN 
A STONE 
THE NEXT TARN IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 
MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL WORDSWORTH 
THOUGHT SO AND CALLED IT DIANA'S 
LOOKING GLASS 
IF MY MAP READING IS UP TO SCRATCH 
IT SHOULD BE JUST OVER THAT HILL 
HERE WE ARE MY FINAL TARN OF THE 
DAY WHAT A PICTURESQUE PLACE 
ANOTHER ONE IN THE BAG 
AT FOUR HUNDRED SEND SIX METRES BLEA TARN 
IS THE HIGHEST OF THE THREE IT HAS 
A REAL FEELING OF REMOTENESS BUT 
WITH THE WEATHER REALLY CLOSING IN 
IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO HEAD FOR 
WARMTH AND SHELTER L. L. WOULD LIKE TO 
THINK I HAVE NOT BACKED MY LAST 
KHAN MACRO TARN 
STILL TO COME 
BEN IS ON THE ROAD IN SEARCH OF 
SPRING BLOSSOM MICHAELA IS WORKING 
WITH SOME RELUCTANT CO STARS TO 
CREATE T. V. MAGIC AND I WILL BE 
JOINED THE PROFESSIONAL POTATO 
TESTERS IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT 
SPUD 
BUT FIRST OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS 
WE HAVE FOLLOWED THE HE FAMILY HE 
HAD DECIDED TO KEEP CHICKENS MORE 
THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE U. K. NOW 
HAVE CHICKENS IN THEIR GARDENS OR 
BACKYARDS IT IS GROWING IN 
POPULARITY ON A FINAL VISIT TO THE 
FAMILY WE FIND OUT HOW THEIR 
CHICKENS HAVE SETTLED IN MEET THE 
FAMILY SIMON EMMA AND THEIR 
CHILDREN LAST A MINIMUM THE 
FAMILY WENT TO A POULTRY SUPPLIER 
AND BOUGHT THREE CHICKENS ONE EACH 
FOR MUM DAD AND JAMES BACK HOME 
THE RELIABLE EGG LAYING HYBRIDS 
WERE INTRODUCED TO THEIR NEW 
QUARTERS THE FAMILY THOUGHT LONG 
AND HARD ABOUT THE NEW ADDITIONS 
THE WHITE ONE IS CALLED ADDITIONS AMBER THE PRIME WANT IS JAMES'S 
CHICKEN AND THE BLACK STAR ESCORT 
CLEANSER BUT IS OUT OF THE 
GODFATHER 
IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE LOST ONE OF 
THE CHICKEN'S THE GIRLS ARE 
HUNTING AROUND THE GARDEN FOR THE 
BLACK STAR CHICKEN 
IT IS QUITE 
SCARY ONE MORNING GOING OUTSIDE 
LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR THE BLACK 
STAR AND WE STILL HAVE NOT FOUND 
HER 
WE HAD DONE ALL WE CAN WE HER HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
A MONSTER MIGHT HAVE EATEN HER 
ARM AND SPARTACUS ARE SAFELY IN THE 
COUPE AND THANKFULLY THERE IS GOOD 
NEWS AROUND THE CORNER 
WE WERE 
QUITE RELIEVED THAT WE FOUND OUR 
CHICKEN OUR MUM HAD TO GO IN THE 
BUSH AND GRAB HER SHE SCRATCHED 
HER ARM ALL THE WAY DOWN THE THE FAMILY PURSE MY LATEST PURCHASES 
ARE TOO SMALL RARE BREED CHICKENS 
THE GIRLS HAVE NAMED HIM TO TOUR 
AND CHLOE 
THEY FEEL QUITE LIGHT AND EASY TO 
HANDLE BECAUSE THEY ARE SMALLER 
THAN THE OTHER CHICKENS 
IT IS GOOD 
WE CAN FINALLY PICK THEM UP THEY 
HADN'T BEEN HANDLED MUCH AT THE 
BREDA WE BOUGHT THEM FROM 
THIS ONE 
HAS GOT A BIT EXCITED 
THEY HAVE 
STARTED PACKING THE BIGGER ONES 
YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE THE 
OTHER WAY ROUND 
INITIALLY THERE 
IS A BIT OF SQUABBLING AND PECKING 
BUT WE HAVE A PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT 
WHERE ONE OF THE BIRDS IS BEING 
CONTINUALLY PEPPERED BUT THAT IS 
BEING TREATED OTHER THAN THAT 
THEY SEEM TO HAVE SETTLED IN WELL 
PECK BEATTIE L. GUESS THEY HAD 
SET UP THE PECKING ORDER PECKED 
THE BANTAMS ARE THE TWO IF THERE 
ARE TROUBLES IN THE RUN THEY TEND 
TO BE THE ONE TO STOP IT 
AS WITH 
ANY PET OR LIVESTOCK WELFARE IS 
PARAMOUNT SO HAS EVERYBODY BEEN 
MUCKING IN WITH THE CHICKEN CHORES 
WE HAVE TO HELP OR ELSE WE WOULD 
NOT BE DOING OUR PART WE AGREED WE 
WOULD HELP IT IS KIND OF FUN DOING 
IT TO START OFF WITH BUT AFTER A 
COUPLE OF TIMES IT IS LIKE OH NO 
WE HAVE TO FEED THEM AGAIN EACH EACH MORNING WHEN WE LET THEM OUT WE 
CHANGE THE WATER AND PUT FRESH FOOD 
OUT EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS WE 
CHANGED THE BEDDING AND THE WOOD 
SHAVINGS IN THE HOUSE ITSELF WE 
CHANGED AT THE WEEKEND WE HAVE A 
GOOD CLEAR OUT 
WHEN WE COME HOME 
FROM SCHOOL WE DO THE CORN FOR 
THEM WHICH IS THERE A TREAT NOW NOW THAT ALL FIVE HENS HAVE SETTLED IN 
ARE THEY ARE EARNING THEIR KEEP WE WE HAVE HAD THREE DOZEN EGGS IN THE 
LAST WEEK 
CERTAINLY AN IMPROVEMENT 
ON THE AVERAGE SHOP BOUGHT CAKE 
THERE ARE A LOT SMALLER 
YES AT 
THE MOMENT SHOP BOUGHT CAKE 
THEY HAVE MASSIVE YOLKS SHOP 
BOUGHT EGG 
IT IS THE SCHOOL HOLIDAYS SO THE 
GIRLS HAD INVITED COUPLE OF 
FRIENDS ROUND TO SEE THEIR CHICKENS 
AND PASSED ON THEIR EXPERTISE 
THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF HOLDING THEM 
YOU HOLD THEM AGAINST YOUR BODY 
HOLDING ONE WING WITH YOUR HANDS 
WRAPPED AROUND THE LEGS OR YOU 
HOLD HER TO THE SIDE LIKE THAT 
THESE ARE FROM THE BANTAMS THEY 
ARE ALL DIFFERENT SIZES AND 
EVERYTHING YOU CAN CHECK ON THEIR 
EAR LOBES IF THEY ARE ALL WHITE 
THEY LAY THESE TYPE OF EGGS 
IT HAS 
BEEN A GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR THE 
CHILDREN THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED 
WITH THE CARE OF THE CHICKENS WILL 
STOP THERE ARE FASCINATING TO WATCH 
YOU COME OUT TO DO QUICK FIVE 
MINUTE CHOR AND THE NEXT THING YOU 
KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN STOOD FOR TWENTY 
MINUTES WATCHING THEM CHORE IF 
YOU HAVE THE ROOM I RECOMMEND IT 
THEY ARE A JOY TO HAVE BUT THERE IS 
A LOT OF HARD WORK INVOLVED BEHIND 
THEM BEING BUILT 
I ALWAYS WANTED A 
CHICKEN AS A PET NOW YOU CAN WALK 
OUT AND GO OH THERE ARE CHICKENS 
IT IS NOT EVERY DAY YOU SEE A 
CHICKEN IN YOUR GARDEN 
DESPITE THE CHILL THAT CAN STILL BE 
AROUND IN THE AIR AND ALL THAT SNOW 
RECENTLY IT IS STILL OFFICIALLY 
SPRINGTIME THE OILSEED RAPE HAS 
FLOWERED AND THERE IS BLOSSOM 
EVERYWHERE WE SENT BENN TO AN AREA 
WHERE THE ORCHARDS AND ROADSIDES 
ARE ABLAZE WITH COLOUR BEN 
SPRING HAS NEARLY SPRUNG AND TREES 
ACROSS THE LAND ARE BEGINNING TO 
BLOSSOM BUT THERE IS ONE PART OF 
THE COUNTRY THAT PROMISES TO BE 
MORE SPECTACULAR THAN ANYWHERE ELSE 
IT IS ONE OF ONLY FOUR PLACES IN 
THE WORLD TO HAVE ITS OWN BLOSSOM 
TRAIL THIS YEAR IT IS CELEBRATING 
ITS SILVER JUBILEE BLOSSOM TRAIL 
TAKES PLACE IN THE VALE OF EVESHAM 
NESTLED BETWEEN THE MALVERN HILLS 
AND THE COTSWOLDS WHICH HAS BEEN 
GROWING FRUIT SINCE MEDIEVAL TIMES 
WITH ROADSIDE AND VILLAGES BURSTING 
INTO COLOUR NOW IS THE BEST TIME 
TO VISIT YOU CAN FOLLOW THE TRAIL 
BY FOOT OR BY BIKE BUT TO SEE THE 
BEST SPOTS LET THE COACH TAKE THE 
STRAIN MORNING MORNING 
THE BLOSSOM TOUR WAS STARTED TWENTY FIVE 
YEARS AGO 
PLUS IT IS THE TREE'S 
STRATEGY TO REPRODUCE BLOSSOM 
AT THIS TIME OF YEAR PLUM TREES 
ARE OUT IN ABUNDANCE WITH THEIR 
WHITE BLOSSOM ATTRACTING BEES AND 
INSECTS 
THE SPRING 
IS MAGICAL IT INSECTS IS DIFFERENT FROM DAY TO DAY 
EVERYWHERE IS SO PRETTY VERY GREEN 
I AM VERY PROUD OF THE VALE OF 
EVESHAM AND THE BLOSSOM IT IS PART 
OF OUR HISTORY AND I LOVE IT DO DO YOU THINK THIS THE BEST TIME OF 
YEAR TO SEE THIS PART OF THE 
COUNTRY 
LOWE ANY TIME IS THE BEST COUNTRY TIME NO 
THE COACH GETS US 
ADMIRE THE BLOSSOM FROM THE COMFORT 
OF BOW SEAT BUT THERE ARE FEW 
PLACES TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK FIRST 
STOP IS THE VILLAGE OF BROADWAY 
WHERE I HAVE A CHAT TO OUR GUIDE 
DIANA RAPHAEL WHY IS THE VALE OF 
EVESHAM FAMOUS FOR ITS FRUIT 
IT IS 
FERTILE SURROUNDED BY THE HILLS OF 
THE MALVERN HILLS AND THE 
COTSWOLDS IT IS FERTILE SOIL 
WHERE DID THE BLOSSOM TRAIL AND 
TOUR START 
IT STARTED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
WHEN THE LOCAL GROWERS WANTED TO 
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME TO THE 
AREA FOR TOURISM BUT ALSO TO BE 
AWARE THAT BLOSSOM IS NOW AND THE 
FRUIT THE HARVEST IS IN SEPTEMBER 
HOW HAVE FRUIT FARMING TECHNIQUES 
CHANGED 
FIFTY YEARS AGO YOU WOULD CHANGED HAVE PEOPLE PICKING BUT THEY WOULD 
NEED LADDERS AND THEY WOULD HAVE 
BIGGER HAMPERS THEY WOULD STRAP TO 
THEM TO CLIMB THE TREES AND PUT THE 
FRUIT IN WHEN THEY PICKED IT FOR 
THE BLOSSOM THEY WOULD BE 
BEAUTIFUL AND VERY HIGH BUT NOW 
THEY HAVE LOPPED THE MIDDLE OF THE 
TREES OUT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY 
A LADETTE TO PICK A FRUIT TREE 
GIVEN THAT YOU DO THIS TOUR A 
NUMBER OF TIMES DO YOU TIRE OF IT 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY LADDER 
NEVER IT IS ALWAYS DIFFERENT EVERY 
TIME 
YOU MIGHT THINK TREES FULL OF TIME BLOSSOM ARE A GOOD SIGN OF THINGS 
TO COME BUT NOT NECESSARILY L. 
WENT IN SEARCH OF THE FRUIT EXPERT 
TO FIND OUT MORE OBVIOUSLY WHEN I 
COME OUT AND WANT TO LOOK AT THE 
BEST BLOSSOM I AM LOOKING FOR THE 
TREES FULL OF AS MANY KIND OF 
FLOWERS AS POSSIBLE IS THAT A GOOD 
THING 
IT IS FROM THE POINT 
OF VIEW THING OF TOURISTS BECAUSE IT IS A NICE 
PICTURE AND FOR THE BLOSSOM TRAIL 
BUT FOR US AS GROWERS TOO MUCH 
BLOSSOM SPELLS DISASTER FOR US 
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW THAT TOO 
MUCH BLOSSOM TOO MUCH FRUIT NOT 
BIG ENOUGH ROPE FOR THAT SEASON 
BUT IT HAS A KNOCK ON EFFECT FOR 
THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHEN WE MAY 
GUESS GET LESS RETURN BLOOM 
NOT ENOUGH NOT BIG ENOUGH FRUIT 
FOR THAT SEASON 
WE ARE OFF ON THE 
NEXT LEG OF THE JOURNEY THE VALE 
OF EVESHAM HAS OVER THIRTY VARIETIES OF 
PLUM AND THE TOUR WOULD NOT BE 
COMPLETE WITHOUT SAMPLING SOME OF 
THEM IN THEIR VARIOUS FORMS PLUM PLUM JAM ON THERE THE PERK PURPLE A 
PLUM 
WHAT IS THIS 
IT IS OUR OWN PLUM RECIPE APPLES CONS WE HAVE 
CREATED SOME APPLES IN THE MIXTURE 
FOR THE BLOSSOM TRAIL A POOR 
SCONE 
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO SCONE USE THE LOCAL PRODUCE 
IT IS WHAT 
THE SHOP IS ALL ABOUT WHEN I FIRST 
CAME HERE THE EMPHASIS WAS ON 
LOCAL PRODUCE LOCAL PLUMS LOCAL 
FRUIT I HAVE SCONES WHATEVER YOU 
LIKE TO CALL THEM 
BASICALLY USING 
ALL THE LOCAL PRODUCE 
WE DO YES 
EVERYTHING WE CAN GET LOCALLY OR 
WE DO IN THE SUMMER WE GET PLUMS 
OBVIOUSLY WHICH START IN JULY AND 
GO THROUGH TO OCTOBER IF WE ARE 
LUCKY GOING THROUGH THIRTY OR FORTY 
DIFFERENT VARIETIES IN THE APPLE 
SEASON WE HAVE REALLY 
SLOE GIN 
DO YOU MAKE SLOE GIN 
I DO BUT 
I MAKE SLOE GIN 
ANYTHING YOU CAN 
RECOMMEND I TRY 
THE DAMSON FUDGE 
IS GORGEOUS 
I'LL TRY A PIECE OF 
THAT 
THAT 
IS REALLY SPECIAL THIS THAT THIS IS MADE FROM 
IT IS THE BUTTER 
FUDGE RECIPE THAT WAS MY MOTHER'S 
I JUST USED SOME DAMSONS THAT WE 
STORE IN THE FREEZER IT IS REALLY 
TASTY 
YOU ARE WANTED WOMAN L. WILL TASTY LET YOU GET OFF L. AM GOING TO HAVE 
A BROWSER THIS IS VERY TASTY A 
BROWSE DESPITE THE APRIL SHOWERS 
AND THE RECENT COLD SPELL THE 
TREES OF EACH AND HAVE FULLY 
BLOSSOMED THE TRAIL IS A FANTASTIC 
WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO COME AND LEARN 
ABOUT THE LOCAL AREA AND ITS 
PRODUCE PRODUCE YOU MAY FIND THIS HARD TO BELIEVE 
I CERTAINLY DO BUT COUNTRYFILE IS 
ABOUT TO CELEBRATE A RATHER SPECIAL 
ANNIVERSARY IN JULY IT WILL BE TWENTY 
YEARS SINCE IT FIRST WENT ON THE 
AIR WE WILL BE HAVING A SPECIAL 
CELEBRATORY PROGRAMME TO MARK THE 
OCCASION BUT NO MILESTONE IN 
TELEVISION IS COMPLETE WITHOUT A 
RATHER SNAZZY TRAILER TO PROMOTE 
THE FACT WE SENT MICHAELA TO 
PINEWOOD STUDIOS HER CHALLENGE WAS 
TO SEE WHAT SHE COULD COME UP WITH 
USING ONLY WHAT NATURE PROVIDES 
THE BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE THE 
PERFECT BACKDROP FOR THE SILVER 
SCREEN 
HUNDREDS OF FILMS WERE MADE IN OUR 
COUNTRYSIDE LAST YEAR THAT MEANS 
PLENTY OF UNUSUAL JOBS FOR THE 
PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE UNUSUAL 
JOBS BRIAN DRESSES SETS WITH 
GREENERY JACKIE SUPPLIES THE 
ANIMALS 
AND FARM PRODUCE IS PROVIDED BY 
PETER BUT WHY THE NEED FOR ALL THE 
SUPPORTING ROLES YOU MAY WELL 
THINK THE BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE IS SO 
PICTURE PERFECT THAT ANY DIRECTOR 
WORTH HIS SALT COULD JUST HIS 
CAMERA AND SHOOT POINT HIS 
CAMERA AND SHOOT IT IS NOT QUITE 
THAT SIMPLE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU 
WANT WINTER TO LOOK LIKE SUMMER 
WELL THEN YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE 
COUNTRYSIDE I HAVE COME TO MEET 
THE PEOPLE AROUND PINEWOOD IN 
SEARCH OF PROPS FOR MY RATHER 
BARREN LOOKING SET SO MY 
CHALLENGE IS TO TURN THIS INTO A 
SET FOR MY AWARD WINNING TRAIL FOR 
THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF COUNTRYFILE 
I THINK I MIGHT NEED A LITTLE BIT 
OF HELP ACTUALLY QUITE A LOT OF 
HELP BRIAN HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO 
DRESS THE SEASONS 
IT IS ALWAYS A 
PROBLEM IN THE SUMMER THEY WANT 
WINTER IN THE WINTER THEY WANT 
SUMMER WE HAVE TO KEEP EVERY 
FOLIAGE EVERY FLOWER ALL IN 
ARTIFICIAL SO YOU CAN CHEAT THE 
EFFECT REALLY IT CAN BE A 
NIGHTMARE 
BRIAN THIS LOOKS LIKE A NIGHTMARE MONSTER TREE 
YES THIS IS PROBABLY 
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEAR OLD OLIVE ITS LAST 
STARRING ROLE WAS ON MAMMA MIA THE 
FILM VERSION OF THE MUSICAL WITH 
MERYL STREEP AND PIERCE BROSNAN 
YOU ALWAYS KNEW HOW TO MAKE AN 
ENTRANCE 
IT WEIGHS JUST OVER SIX ENTRANCE TONNES THEY ACTUALLY WANTED TO 
DANCE UNDERNEATH THE BRANCHES BUT 
BECAUSE OLIVES DON'T USUALLY GROW 
WITH LARGE CANOPIES WE HAD TO 
GRAFT ON IF YOU CAN SEE THERE 
ARE METAL SADDLES BOLTED ON TO THE 
MAIN TRUNK WITH TUBES WELDED TO 
THOSE THEN WE ADDED BRANCHES SO 
IT IS FIFTEEN TWENTY F. T. TO THE SIDE OF THE 
TREE WE THEN AT ARTIFICIAL FOLIAGE 
TO THOSE BRANCHES SO IT CREATES A 
CANOPY WE THEN ADD THIS IS 
BASICALLY A TREE TRUNK WE HAVE 
GRAFTED ON THE BRANCH AND ADDED 
ARTIFICIAL BLOSSOM 
THIS IS A REAL 
TREE TRUNK 
THAT IS REAL 
AND THIS 
IS A REAL BRANCH 
THAT IS A REAL 
BRANCH 
AND THESE ARE JUST FAKE BRANCH FLOWERS 
YES THEY ARE ACTUALLY FLOWERS THREE TYPES OF BLOSSOM ON THERE IT 
IS MIXED IN IT WILL BE SO QUICK ON 
CAMERA 
IT LOOKS SO REALISTIC I'M CAMERA I'M GLAD ABOUT THAT 
I AM ON THE HUNT 
FOR A FEW PROPS FOR MY LITTLE PROMO 
FOR THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY BRIAN IS 
GOING TO LEND ME SOME GIANT TURNIPS 
THESE LOOK BRILLIANT 
OF IT IS A 
LITTLE BIT DUSTY 
THAT WILL WORK 
WELL WELL EVEN FARMERS AROUND PINEWOOD 
STUDIOS ARE GETTING IN ON THE ACT 
YOU HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY INVOLVED 
WITH THE FILM INDUSTRY FOR A WHILE 
HAS IT TAKEN OVER PALMING FOR YOU 
IS THE JOBLING BUSINESS CERTAINLY CERTAINLY NOT IS IT YOUR MAIN BUSINESS 
THE PROBLEM WITH THE FILM BUSINESS 
IS IT IS CYCLICAL ONE WEEK 
EVERYBODY WANTS US AND THEN WE DO 
NOT SEE EVERYBODY FOR MUM SO SO OPPORTUNITIES DO NOT COME OFTEN FOR A MONTH OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOT 
REGULAR BUT WE ENJOY DOING IT THE THE NEW DANIEL CRAIG MOVIE FLASHBACKS 
OF A FOOL USED PETER'S FARM AS THE 
LOCATION FOR HIS LOVE INTEREST 
WHICH ONE CAN I HAVE THAT LOOKS 
INCREDIBLE 
IF WE USE THIS IN YOUR INCREDIBLE FILM WISHEART CHOP IT OFF SO IT 
CAN BE STOOD UP AGAIN 
A BIT OF 
COLOUR WOULD BE NICE PURPLE IS 
GOOD I HAVE SOME VEGETABLES TO 
DRESS THE SET WITH IF I AM TO 
REPRESENT COUNTRYFILE I NEED TO 
BORROW SOME ANIMALS 
MILI MILI 
YOU ARE MAKING HER 
WILD THIS IS NEARLY TOTALLY 
UNTRAINED THIS IS TELLY TILLY IS 
THE ANIMAL THAT HAS EARNED THE MOST 
MONEY REALLY 
THE REINDEER ARE MONEY REALLY COMING UP FAST BEHIND TO SHE SHE REALLY IS A STAR PERFORMER YEAH YEAH SHE HAS DONE IT MY HERO 
THE ANIMALS LEARN THE WORD ACTION 
A LOT OF THEM GO OFF ON STANDBY IF 
YOU DID DENNIS ON A FILM SET HE 
WOULD BE GONE THIS A DONKEY IS A 
GREAT ESCAPE ARTIST HE HAS BEEN IN 
QUITE A FEW THINGS HE IS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE 
HE HAS NO TEETH 
THESE ARE YOUR 
COMEDY PERFORMERS 
DENNIS DOES NOT 
LOOK VERY FUNNY BUT HE IS QUITE 
HILARIOUS 
IN EXCHANGE FOR SOME CARROTS ARE 
LINED UP DENNIS THE DONKEY TO 
COME TO MY SET I LINED UP 
DENNIS BUT FIRST I HAD TO BUILD 
IT 
RIGHT I HAVE ALL MY PROPS NOW ALL 
I NEED IS A GOOD IDEA NORMALLY ON 
THESE THINGS YOU START OFF WITH THE 
IDEA AND GET YOUR PROPS NOT ON OUR 
BUDGET 
O. K. NEED THE CREATIVE JUICES TO FLOW LIGHTS CAMERA ACTION TAKE ONE O. K. RIGHT LIGHTS CAMERA ACTION TAKE TWO 
WELL SHE CERTAINLY DOES TO THE 
CHALLENGE WE WILL HAVE MORE ABOUT 
THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY CLOSER TO THE 
DATE IN JULY IN A MOMENT I WILL 
BE JOINING SPUD TASTING PANEL 
BEFORE THAT LETS HER DOWN TO THE 
LONDON WEATHER LETTERS HEAD DOWN 
YOU SAW THE BLOSSOM TRYING TO GET 
THROUGH AS BEN WAS IN EVESHAM IT 
WAS HAMPERED BY THE COLD WEATHER 
WHICH WE ARE ENDURING A COLD EAST 
WIND IT IS STILL BLOWING BUT NOT 
AS STRONG THINGS ARE NOT AS BAD AS 
NESTLE SOME DRAMATIC CHANGES BUT 
THE BASIC FEATURES ARE THERE 
EVERYTHING IS WRAPPING AROUND THIS 
DIRECTION DRAGGING WIND OFF THE 
NORTH SEA FOR SCOTT AND THE 
CHANGES ARE SUBTLE IT IS AN 
EASTERLY BREEZE THE EAST COAST IS 
CALL UP AND WEST SOUTH OF THE 
BORDERS THIS IS THE WORST PICTURE 
THAN YESTERDAY MORE RAIN AROUND 
YOU SEE HOLES IN THEIR CLOUD WE 
THINK WHEN THE MORNING FOG HAS GONE 
THE SON SHOULD COME OUT PRODUCED 
SHOWERS BUT PRODUCE TEMPERATURES BY 
FIVE DEGREES IF YOU GET CAUGHT IN 
THE SHOWERS YOU WILL NOT THINK 
THAT IS GOOD IT IS STILL COLD OVER 
NORTHERN IRELAND THE DRIVING FORCE 
IS TWO HOURS SOUTH AND AN EASTERLY 
BREEZE THAT HAS KEPT THE FROST 
AWAY THE SAME IS TRUE TO HER 
MONDAY MORNING START FROSTY IN THE 
HIGHLANDS FOR THE REST THE BLUE 
HIS REIGN CURLING THROUGH THE 
CHANNEL MENDIP AS MY DRIVING FORCE 
IS LOW PRESSURE TO THE SOUTH 
DIFFERENCES ARE SLIGHT THE WIND 
COMING OFF THE NORTH SEA THE WIND 
HAS TAKEN MORE OF A TURN WHEN YOU 
SAY GOODBYE TO THE RAIN THE 
CHANCES ARE ANY REMAINING CLOUD 
WILL SEE BIG HOLES PUNCHED IN IT 
WILL BE COOLER THAN THE EAST COAST 
THE SUN SHOULD LIFT TEMPERATURES BY 
A DEGREE OR SO MORE THAN THAT 
MAYBE IT COULD BE NICE LOOKING 
DAY TOMORROW LET'S LEAVE IT FOR 
TUESDAY TO BE WARMER STILL WE 
START WITH TUESDAY ONE OF LOW 
DISAPPEARS SNOW ON THE ALPS 
SKIERS WILL LOVE IT THE NEXT LAYER 
HAS NOT BOUGHT THE RAIN IN WE ARE 
BETWEEN EIGHT RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE A SHOWER OR TWO IS A 
POSSIBILITY THERE WILL BE SOME 
CLOUD AROUND TUESDAY NIGHT 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THE FRONT GOES 
THROUGH A BAND OF RAIN LASTING 
SEVERAL HOURS IT WILL MAKE THE 
GROUND AND WET THAT WILL BE 
WONDERFUL FOR SOME BUT NOT OTHERS 
UNLESS YOU ARE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
WILL CALL MORE WHEN STILL BE A 
DISAPPOINTMENT TEMPERATURES WERE 
DIP WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY 
YOU DRIVE ONE A LOT OF RAIN AWAY 
LIFT PRESSURE FROM THE SOUTH THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE U. K. SHOULD 
ENJOY WARM POTENTIALLY SUNNY 
WEATHER NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
SCOTLAND A SOUTH WESTERLY WIND 
WITH SHOWERS THAT WILL FILL COOL 
THIS SET UP IS MORE REMINISCENT OF 
WATCH EXPECTED DURING SPRING OR 
EARLY SUMMER WARM SUNSHINE 
POTENTIAL IN THE SOUTH EAST CORNER 
FREQUENT SHOWERS ON A PREVAILING 
SOUTH WEST WIND FRIDAY A REPEAT 
PERFORMANCE ONCE WE HAD BROKEN 
BITS EASTERLY SHOULD BE AN IMPROVING PICTURE

TAKE A MARVEL OF EACH SAMPLE AND 
PUNCH PREFERENCES ON TO THE SCREEN

CONFERRING THE LABORATORY HAS 
SPECIAL LIGHTS WITH DIFFERENT 
COLOURS BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT IS 
IMPORTANT NOT TO KNOW THE ACTUAL 
COLOUR OF THE FOOD BUT NOT TODAY

ORDINARY LIGHT THIS IS A HIGHLY 
SKILLED JOB YOU HAVE TO KNOW JUST 
HOW TO TASTE FOOD BEFORE YOU CAN
