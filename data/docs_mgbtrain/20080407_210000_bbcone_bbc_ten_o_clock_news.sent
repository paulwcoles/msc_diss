INSISTS THE 
COUPLE WERE MURDERED 
SAID HE WAS DISAPPOINTED BY THE 
OUTCOME OUR ROYAL CORRESPONDENT 
HAS FOLLOWED THE ENTIRE HEARING 
AND IS AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE TONIGHT 
SO AFTER THIS EXHAUSTIVE INQUIRY 
THESE VERY IMPORTANT VERDICTS THE 
JURY HAS REJECTED ANY IDEA THAT THE 
CRASH WAS CAUSED BY A CONSPIRACY 
BUT THEY FOUND THE CRASH WASN'T 
SIMPLY STRAIGHT FORWARD ACCIDENT 
THEY FOUND THAT THE CRASH WAS 
CAUSED BY RECKLESSNESS AND GROSS 
NEGLIGENCE THE VERDICTS MEAN THAT 
HENRI PAUL AND PAPARAZZI STAND 
ACCUSED IN EFFECT OF THE 
MANSLAUGHTER OF DODI AL FAYED AND 
DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES 
SHE WAS THE FAIRYTALE PRINCESS WHO 
IN LIFE WAS THE FOCUS OF 
INTERNATIONAL FASCINATION AND WHO 
AFTER HER TRAGIC DEATH BECAME THE 
CENTRE OF WORLDWIDE SPECULATION 
ABOUT AN ALLEGED MURDER CONSPIRACY 
NOW FINALLY AFTER MORE THAN A 
DECADE THERE IS THE CHANCE TO DRAW 
A DEFINITIVE LINE 
MOHAMED AL FAYED THE MAN WHO HAS 
SPENT MILLIONS OF POUNDS PURSUING 
THE CONSPIRACY CLAIMS CAME TO 
COURT TODAY TO HEAR THE CONCLUSION 
OF SIX MONTHS OF EVIDENCE FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
WITNESSES WITNESSES SHORTLY BEFORE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THE JURY 
FOREWOMAN GOT TO HER FEET TO 
DELIVER THE VERDICTS AMONG THE 
MANY LISTENING WERE MR. AL FAYED 
AND DIANA'S ELDER SISTER LADY 
SARAH MCCORQUODALE THE MAJORITY 
VERDICTS WERE OF 
IN OTHER WORDS THE JURY WAS 
SATISFIED THAT HENRI PAUL WAS 
GUILTY OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE IN 
TAKING THE 
WHEN HE KNEW HE 
HAD BEEN DRINKSING AND OF 
RECKLESSNESS IN DRIVING AT SUCH 
EXCESSIVE SPEED AND THEN THERE IS 
THE PAPARAZZI THE MEN WHO PURSUED 
THE CAR AND PHOTOGRAPHED THE DYING 
BUT REFUSED TO COME TO THE INQUEST 
TO TESTIFY THE JURY FOUND THEY HAD 
BEEN GROSSLY NEGLIGENT PRINCES 
WILLIAM AND HARRY THANKED THE JURY 
OUTSIDE THE COURT THE FORMER 
COMMISSIONER OF THE METROPOLITAN 
POLICE LORD STEVENS WHO HEADED 
THE BRITISH INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
CRASH GAVE HIS REACTION 
I JUST 
HOPE THAT THIS CAN BRING CLOSURE TO 
WHAT HAS BEEN A TRAUMATIC EVENT FOR 
A LOT OF PEOPLE MR. AL FAYED HAS 
SAID THAT HE WILL ACCEPT THE 
VERDICT OF THE JURY THE VERDICT 
HAS BEEN CLEAR THEY HAVE SAID THEY 
ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT THERE IS 
NO CONSPIRACY IN RELATION TO THIS 
MATTER 
BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY IT MATTER WAS APPARENT THAT MOHAMED AL FAYED 
HAD NO INTENTION OF ACCEPTING THE 
VERDICTS HIS SPOKESWOMAN TALKED 
AGAIN OF MURDER 
I'M NOT THE ONLY 
PERSON WHO SAYS THEY WERE MURDERED 
DIANA PREDICTED SHE WOULD BE 
MURDERED AND HOW IT WOULD HAPPEN 
SO I AM DISAPPOINTED THE VERDICTS 
WILL COME AS A BLOW TO THE MANY 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD 
WHO HAVE SUPPORTED MY STRUGGLE AND 
I THANK THEM 
FOR MOHAMED AL FAYED 
THE VERDICTS ARE A HUMILIATION FOR 
DIANA'S BROTHER EARL SPENCER THEY 
ARE A VINDICATION FOR WHAT HE SAID 
IN THE HOURS AFTER HIS SISTER'S 
DEATH 
I ALWAYS BELIEVED THE PRESS DEATH WOULD KILL HER IN THE END 
NOT EVEN 
I COULD 
IMAGINE THEY 
WOULD TAKE 
SUCH A DIRECT HAND IN HER DEATH 
TODAY THOSE CLOSE TO DIANA WERE 
ASKING MR. AL FAYED TO END HIS 
CAMPAIGN 
I JUST 
HOPE NOW HE WILL CAMPAIGN FIND SOME SORT OF PEACE AND STOP 
PURSUING THIS LINE OF INQUIRY THE 
WHOLE CIRCUMSTANCE CUSS THAT HE HAS 
REALLY KEPT ON THE CIRCUS THAT 
HE HAS KEPT ON THE ROAD SINGLE 
HANDEDLY NOW HE NEEDS TO ALLOW 
DIANA AND HIS SON SOME DIGNITY AND 
LET THEM REST 
YET MOHAMED AL FAYED 
LEFT COURT WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING 
STILL IT SEEMS UNABLE TO COME TO 
TERMS WITH 
WHAT A 
JURY HAS NOW 
RULED IS REALITY 
THE INQUEST HAS LASTED SIX MONTHS 
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE ESTIMATES 
IT HAS COST THE TAXPAYER SOME EIGHT 
MILLION MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WITNESSES 
GAVE EVIDENCE AT THE INQUIRY WITH 
WITNESSES FROM FRANCE AMERICA AND 
AUSTRALIA WE LOOK AT WHAT THE 
INQUIRY 
HAS REVEALED 
OF THE EVENT 
ON THE NIGHT 
THE EVENTS OF THE NIGHT IN PARIS 
HAVE BEEN PIECED TOGETHER DAMMING 
DRINK DRIVER AND PHOTOGRAPHERS IN 
THE SEARCH FOR A SCOOP THE 
A SMILING PRINCESS DIANA AND DODI 
AL FAYED ON THE AFTERNOON OF 
AUGUST THIRTIETH NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THEY WERE HOPING 
LONGING FOR PRIVACY WHEREVER THEY 
WENT THE PAPARAZZI FOLLOWED 
REMEMBER PICTURES OF PRINCESS DIANA 
AND DODI AL FAYED TOGETHER WERE 
WORTH A SMALL FORTUNE 
PHOTOGRAPHERS DOGGED THEIR EVERY 
MOVE HERE IN PARIS FORCING THE 
COUPLE TO ABANDON PLANS TO DINE OUT 
AT ONE EXCLUSIVE RESTAURANT THEY 
ENDED UP RETREATING BACK HERE AT 
THE RITZ STAFF HADN'T PLANNED ON 
THEIR RETURN AND WERE IN A PANIC 
THE DEPUTY HEAD OF 
SECURITY HENRI 
PAUL HAD TO BE CALLED BACK IN HE 
HAD BEEN OFF DUTY FOR THREE HOURS 
HE SEEMS O. K. AS HE TIES HIS SHOE 
LACES DESPITE EARLY DENIALS STAFF 
AT THE RITZ ADMITTED HENRI PAUL HAD 
BEEN DRINKING THE JURY WAS GIVEN 
SOME INDICATION HOW MUCH NO ONE 
KNOWS EXACTLY HOW MUCH HENRI PAUL 
DRANK THAT NIGHT BUT THIS RITZ BAR 
BILL PROVES HE DRANK AT LEAST TWO 
MEASURES OF SPIRIT FOUR SINGLE 
MEASURES OF WHISKEY TESTS SHOWED 
HE WAS THREE TIMES THE FRENCH 
DRINK DRIVE LIMIT TWICE THAT OF 
THE U. K. HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN 
BEHIND THE WHILE OF A CAR 
EVEN IF 
YOU FEEL NORMAL WHEN SOMETHING 
UNUSUAL HAPPENS THAT REQUIRES RAPID 
DECISIONS AND RAPID REACTIONS TO 
THAT CHANGING 
SITUATION YOU 
NOT BE ABLE TO COPE WITH IT 
DODI DECIDES TO TAKE DIANA TO HIS 
APARTMENT ON THE CHAMPS ELYSEES HE 
AND HENRI PAUL HATCH A PLAN TO 
SHAKE OFF THE PAPARAZZI WHO ARE 
GROWING RESTLESS THIS FOOTAGE 
SHOWS THE MASS AT THE RITZ THEY 
HAVE WAITED ALL DAY AND THEY ARE 
ANXIOUS FOR PICTURES AMONG THEM 
THE RAN ON THE BIKE STEPHANE 
DARMON DISPATCH RIDER WORKING 
WITH PHOTOGRAPHER ROMAULD RAT THE 
JURY HEARD THEY WERE WITH THE PACK 
OF PAPARAZZI THAT LATER CHASED 
DIANA AND DODI'S CAR INTO THE ALMA 
TUNNEL THE COUPLE WERE HOPING TO 
ESCAPE THE PHOTOGRAPHERS BY LEAVING 
FROM THE BACK OF THE HOTEL SOME 
HAD STAKED OUT THE REAR HERE IS 
HENRI PAUL ACKNOWLEDGING THEM WITH 
A WAVE THEY TAKE THESE LAST SHOTS 
OF DIANA ALIVE AT THE TOP OF THIS 
PICTURE YOU CAN SEE HENRI PAUL'S 
MERCEDES PULLING AWAY FOLLOWED BY 
THE PAPARAZZI DON'T TRY TO FOLLOW 
US YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO CATCH UP 
WERE HIS LAST WORDS TO THEM 
FOUR MINUTES LATER THE MERCEDES 
APPROACHES THE ALMA TUNNEL 
TRAVELLING AT TWICE THE SPEED LIMIT 
AROUND SIXTY TO SIXTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR THE 
MERCEDES CLIP AS WHITE FIAT UNION 
KNOW IT WAS NO MORE THAN A 
GLANCING BLOW VEERING TO THE RIGHT 
LEFT AND RIGHT AGAIN AND SMASHING 
INTO THE PILLAR IN THE TUNNEL THE 
FIAT UNION KNOW DIDN'T STOP IN 
COURT A POLICE EXPERT RULED OUT THE 
OTHER CAR AS A MAJOR CAUSE OF THE 
ACCIDENT AND TWO 
WITNESSES WHO 
DESCRIBED SEEING 
A 
BRIGHT FLASH 
OF 
LIGHT IN THE TUNNEL WERE DEEMED 
UNRELIABLE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT WAS 
HENRI PAUL'S OVERZEALOUS STEERING 
HIS UNFAMILIARITY WITH THE CAR AND 
HIS EXCESSIVE SPEED WITH PICTURE 
WAS TAKEN MOMENTS AFTER THE CRASH 
BY THE PHOTOGRAPHER ROMAULD RAT 
SPEAKING TO THE B. B. C. A MONTH LATER 
HE ADMITTED HE DIDN'T CALL FOR HELP 
NINE PHOTOGRAPHERS ALONG WITH 
DISPATCH RIDER STEPHANE DARMON 
WERE ARRESTED BY FRENCH POLICE BUT 
NEVER PROSECUTED PRINCESS DIANA 
WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD AT FOUR HUNDRED A M. ON 
THE MORNING OF AUGUST THIRTY FIRST NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
PERHAPS THE BIGGEST TRAGEDY AT ALL 
ACCORDING TO THE JURY WAS THAT A 
SEATBELT MAY HAVE SAVED HER LIFE 
TODAY'S VERDICTS REPRESENT A CLEAR 
REJECTION OF THE CLAIMS MADE BY 
MOHAMED AL FAYED THAT DIANA AND 
DODI HAD BEEN MURDERED 
OUR ROYAL CORRESPONDENT HAS SPOKEN 
EXCLUSIVELY TO TWO FIGURES WHO 
WORKED CLOSELY WITH MR. AL FAYED A 
DECADE AGO 
ONE OF THE PEOPLE WAS IN CHARGE OF 
THE RITZ THAT NIGHT IN PARIS 
THIS IS B. B. C. TELEVISION FROM LONDON 
DIANA PRINCESS 
OF WALES 
HAS DIED 
AFTER A CAR 
CRASH IN 
PARIS FROM 
FROM THE VERY FIRST MOMENT HE HEARD THE 
NEWS MOHAMED AL FAYED HAS BEEN 
CONVINCED DIANA AND HIS SON WERE 
MURDERED BY THE BRITISH 
ESTABLISHMENT ESTABLISHMENT FOR TEN YEARS HE HAS SPARED NO 
EXPENSE PULLING TOGETHER THE 
STRANDS OF HIS IMAGINARY CONSPIRACY 
THIS MAN KNOWS THE LENGTHS TO WHICH 
THE AL FAYED ORGANISATION HAS BEEN 
PREPARED TO GO HE'S THE FORMER 
NUMBER TWO AT THE PARIS RITZ THE 
MAN WHO WELCOMED DIANA AND DODI TO 
THE RITZ THAT FATEFUL AFTERNOON 
AND WHO IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE 
MORNING RUSHED TO THE SCENE OF THE 
ACCIDENT IN THE ALMA TUNNEL THERE 
HE FOUND TWO RITZ HOTEL CHAUFFEURS 
WHO GAVE HIM SOME DISTURBING 
INFORMATION 
THEY BOTH SAID TO ME INFORMATION THEY SAW HENRI PAUL WE TRIED TO 
AVOID HE DRIVES BUT AS HE'S 
PROTECTED BY MR. KLEIN WE COULD NOT 
REALLY REFUSE 
WHAT DID THEY MEAN 
BY HE WAS NOT NORMAL 
NOT NORMAL IN 
THE WAY THEY HAD AN IDEA HE WAS 
DRUNK OR UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF 
ALCOHOL 
THE MR. KLEIN REFERRED TO ALCOHOL THERE WAS THIS MAN FRANZ KLEIN 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE RITZ A LOYAL 
AL FAYED EMPLOYEE FOR THE PAST THIRTY 
YEARS THE INQUEST HEARD A CLAIM 
THAT MR. KLEIN HAD ORDERED A RITZ 
BARMAN WHO SUSPECTED HENRI PAUL 
WAS DRUNK TO SAY HE HAD ONLY BEEN 
DRINKING FRUIT JUICE AT THE HOTEL 
WHEN IN FACT HE HAD THE 
EQUIVALENT OF FOUR SINGLE WHISKEYS 
THE LINE THAT HENRI PAUL HAD NOT 
TOUCHED ALCOHOL AT THE RITZ WAS 
REPEATED BY ANOTHER ONE OF MR. AL 
FAYED'S DEVOTED EMPLOYEES JOHN 
MCNAMARA HEAD OF SECURITY HE WAS 
INTERVIEWED ON TELEVISION ABOUT THE 
ACCIDENT 
FOR THE FIRST TIME DODI ACCIDENT AL FAYED'S SECURITY TEAM SPEAK HE HE HAD A PINAPPLE JUICE AND NOTHING 
ELSE 
THAT QUITE SIMPLY WAS A ELSE BLATANT LIE AND JUST AS THE AL 
FAYED ORGANISATION PLAYED DOWN 
HENRI PAUL'S KNOWN DRINKING THAT 
NIGHT IT PLAYED UP THE SUGGESTION 
THAT DODI AND THE PRINCESS WERE 
ABOUT TO GET ENGAGED DODI WENT TO 
THE JEWELLERY STORE NEAR THE RITZ 
ON THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THE CRASH 
CLAUDE ROULET WENT WITH HIM DID 
DODI AT ANY STAGE SAY HE WAS 
LOOKING FOR AN ENGAGMENT RING 
NEVER HE WAS LOOKING FOR A RING 
NOT FOR AN ENGAGMENT RING 
CURIOUSLY THOUGH A FRENCH 
NEWSPAPER WAS FED A STORY THAT 
DIANA AND DODI HAD CHOSEN AN 
ENGAGMENT RING TOGETHER ANOTHER 
DISTORTION DISTORTION BIT BY BIT THE AL FAYED 
ORGANISATION PROMOTED THE IDEA OF A 
CONSPIRACY AIDED BY FREQUENT 
STORIES IN NEWSPAPERS LIKE THE 
DAILY EXPRESS LAURIE MAYER WAS 
DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS FOR AL 
FAYED HE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON 
THE INSIDE 
THERE WAS A LOT OF 
STUFF THAT WAS GLILDED OVER 
OVEREGGED 
ACCORDING TO LAURIE OVEREGGED MAYER MOHAMED AL FAYED'S ADVISERS 
HAVE STOKED UP HIS OBSESSION WITH A 
CONSPIRACY 
THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM CONSPIRACY FED WHAT MANY OF US VIEWED AS A 
FANTASY AND I THINK THAT IS THE 
DEPLORABLE MOHAMMED WAS THE GREAT 
HONEY POT AND SADLY THERE WERE A 
LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHO DID 
AND SAID ONLY WHAT HE WANTED TO 
HEAR HEAR MOHAMED AL FAYED HAD PERHAPS SEEN 
HIS SON'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ROYAL 
PRINCESS AS WAY OF GETTING BACK AT 
THE BRITISH ESTABLISHMENT WHICH HE 
FELT HAD REPEATEDLY HUMILIATED HIM 
HE WAS VERY PROUD TO GET SOMEONE OF 
THE BRITISH ESTABLISHMENT AND 
SOMEONE VERY CLOSE TO THE THROWN 
COMING IN HIS OWN HOUSE IT WAS HIS 
REVENGE ON THE BRITISH 
ESTABLISHMENT AND SUDDENLY 
EVERYTHING DISAPPEARED 
ALL THE 
HURT ALL THE ANGER ALL THE 
SADNESS ACCUMULATED OVER THE YEARS 
SOME HOW CAME TOGETHER IN THE ALMA 
TUNNEL IT JUST REALLY ALMOST MADE 
HIM LOSE HIS REASON 
TEN YEARS ON CAN MOHAMED AL FAYED 
EMERGE FROM HIS STATE OF ANGUISH 
DENIAL AND WALK AWAY FROM THE SO 
CALLED TRUTH THAT HE HAS BUILT FOR 
HIMSELF HIMSELF WE RETURN TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE 
YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE CHANCE TO DRAW 
A DEFINITIVE LINE AFTER TODAY HOW 
REALISTIC IS THAT 
YOU KNOW I'M TEMPTED TO SAY THAT 
SURELY IN THE MINDS OF REASONABLE 
AND FRANKLY RATIONAL PEOPLE SURELY 
IT SHOULD THE INQUEST HAD TO BE ON 
THE EPIC 
SCALE BECAUSE 
OF THE SCALE 
OF THE ALLEGATION MADE BY 
OF THE ALLEGATION MADE BY MOHAMED AL 
FAYED AND THE 
CURRENCY IT 
GAPED THAT CONSPIRACY ALLEGATION 
HAS BEEN 
RUN TO 
GROUND TRULY 
TRULY THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR IT 
WILL IT 
DRAW A 
LINE MR. 
AL 
FAYED AT 
THE MOMENT 
DOESN'T SEEM PREPARED 
ABLE TO DO THAT AND ACCEPT THE 
TRUTH THAT THIS CRASH WAS CAUSED 
ABOVE ALL BY TOO MUCH SPEED TOO 
MUCH DRINK AND THE PURSUIT OF THE 
PAPARAZZI PAPARAZZI SOME OF THE DAY'S OTHER NEWS NOW 
THERE WILL BE NO CHANGE TO THE 
GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO ABOLISH 
THE TEN P. STARTING RATE OF INCOME TAX 
THAT IS THE WORD FROM DOWNING 
STREET TODAY A COMMITTEE OF M. P.'S 
HAS CRITICISED THE POLICY SAYING 
PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES WILL LOSE OUT 
AND THEY ARE AN UNREASONABLE TARGET 
FOR RAISING EXTRA MONEY THE CHANGE 
WHICH CAME INTO EFFECT THIS WEEKEND 
WAS DEVISED BY GORDON BROWN IN HIS 
LAST BUDGET AS CHANCELLOR HARD AT 
WORK GORDON BROWN ON THE STUMP 
TODAY CAMPAIGNING AT A FACTORY IN 
OXFORD BUT MANY LOW PAID WORKERS 
MIGHT NOT BE PLEASED TO SEE HIM 
THE TEN P. RATE HAS GONE BUT THEPM 
ISN'T SHIFTING 
IN EVERY AREA FOR 
PENSIONERS FAMILIES AND LOW PAID 
WORKERS WE HAVE DONE WHAT WE CAN 
TO SAFEGUARD AND PROTECT PEOPLE AT 
A DIFFICULT TIME FOR THE WORLD 
ECONOMY WHERE PEOPLE WANT 
STABILITY THEY WANT INFLATION LOW 
AND INTEREST RATES LOW AS WELL 
PERHAPS IT 
SEEMED 
LIKE A 
GOOD IDEA 
AT THE TIME IN HIS 
FINAL BUDGET 
GORDON BROWN 
CUT THE BASIC RATE OF 
INCOME TAX THAT WAS MONEY IN THE 
POCKET OF MOST EARNERS BUT THE TEN P. 
RATE WAS ABOLISHED WHEN GORDON 
BROWN TOOK HIS BUDGET DOWN THE TAX 
PLANS WERE CHEERED BY M. P.'S NOW THE 
CHANGES ARE TAKING EFFECT AND HE'S 
IN NUMBER TEN THERE IS ANXIETY IN 
THE LABOUR BACKBENCHES IT IS 
SINKING IN THAT MILLIONS ON THE 
LOWEST INCOMES WILL PAY MORE TAX 
RANDALLS IS A VALUER IN AN ESTATE 
AGENTS AND HAS NO CHILDREN HE'S 
FURIOUS 
I'M NOT EARNING A LOT I FURIOUS SHOULDN'T BE TAXED MORE THAN ANYONE 
ELSE 
MORE 
PEOPLE GAIN THAN LOSE ELSE PEOPLE WITH CHILDREN WHO CLAIM TAX 
CREDITS WILL BE BETTER 
MORE TAX WILL BE DUE FOR A CALL 
CENTRE EMPLOYER ON FIFTEEN WITH NO 
CHILDREN A BUILDER EARNING EIGHTEEN THOUSAND 
WILL BREAK EVEN BUT AN OFFICE 
MANAGER ON THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND WILL PAY LESS 
WHAT ANGERS MANY LABOUR M. P.'S IS THE 
TAX BILLS OF THE FIVE MILLION 
PEOPLE ON LOWEST INCOME WILL GO UP 
IF LABOUR IS IN BUSINESS FOR 
ANYTHING IT IS TO PROTECT THE 
POOREST IN OUR COMMUNITY AS 
RESULT OF SIMPLIFYING THE TAX 
SYSTEM WHICH MOST PEOPLE SUPPORT 
WE NOW FIND OURSELVES IN A POSITION 
OF MAKING THE LOWEST PAID WORSE OFF 
MORE THAN SEVENTY LABOUR M. P.'S MANY OF 
THEM NORMALLY LOYAL 
WISH THIS 
HADN'T 
BEEN DONE 
AND THE 
CONSERVATIVES AND 
THE 
LIB DEMS 
IT IS UNFAIR THE TEN P. RATE 
MAY HAVE 
DISAPPEARED BUT 
LABOUR'S 
DISAPPEARED BUT LABOUR'S ANGQUIRB OVER IT COULD
