ISLANDS IN THE AFRICAN PLAINS THE ANCIENT NAABI HILLS 
BROOD OVER THE MOST SAVAGE LANDSCAPE ON THE PLANET 
BORN INTO THIS WORLD A NEW HYENA PRINCESS 
SHE IS NAMED AFTER THE HILLS NAABI 
IN HER TIME SHE MUST BECOME A POWERFUL HUNTER 
ABLE TO TAKE ON BEASTS FAR LARGER THAN HER 
BEING A PRINCESS WON'T SPARE HER FROM TRAGEDY 
THERE WILL BE A TIME 
WHEN THESE EARLY DAYS AROUND HER DEN WILL SEEM VERY PRECIOUS INDEED 
NAABI IS BORN AT NIGHT 
SHE HAS A FULL SET OF TEETH AND ALREADY SHE KNOWS HOW TO USE THEM 
WITHIN MINUTES OF BIRTH SHE SAVAGES HER SISTER 
NAABI IS THE MORE AGGRESSIVE AND QUICKLY SUBDUES HER SIBLING 
SO SHE GETS WHAT SHE WANTS 
THE BEST NIPPLE AND THE LION'S SHARE OF HER MOTHER'S PRECIOUS MILK 
IT WILL MAKE HER BIGGER AND STRONGER THAN HER SISTER 
SO EVEN NOW 
NAABI HAS A HEAD START 
SHE WAS BORN ON THE SHORT GRASS PLAINS OF TANZANIA'S SERENGETI 
HER MOTHER IS A QUEEN RULER OF THE NDUTU CLAN 
FORTY HYENAS WHO LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF THE NAABI HILL 
SO BY BIRTHRIGHT THIS TINY CUB IS A PRINCESS 
WHO COULD THINK THAT EVEN NOW 
THIS LITTLE NAABI COULD BE SO IMPORTANT TO HER MOTHER 
THE QUEEN NEEDS HER THOUGH 
WITHOUT SUPPORT THE QUEEN'S RULE IS NOTHING IN THE CLAN 
SO SHE NEEDS ALL HER SISTERS AND DAUGHTERS BEHIND HER 
NAABI NEEDS A LOT OF ATTENTION 
SHE'S THE DOMINANT DAUGHTER 
SO SHE'S FIRST IN LINE TO THE THRONE 
SHE HAS THE POWER TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING EVEN ANNOY THE QUEEN 
THE QUEEN DOES NOT MIND THOUGH 
JUST THE TWO OF US 
WE CAN MAKE IT IF WE TRY 
JUST THE TWO OF US 
JUST THE TWO OF US 
JUST THE TWO OF US 
BUILDING CASTLES IN THE SKY 
JUST THE TWO OF US 
NOTHING IS MORE PRECIOUS TO HER THAN HER LITTLE NAABI 
AND BESIDES SHE HAS BEEN BITTEN AND ATTACKED BY ANIMALS FAR BIGGER 
THESE GAMES ARE FUN FOR NAABI BUT THEY ARE IMPORTANT LESSONS TOO 
SHE MUST LEARN TO BE AGGRESSIVE LEARN TO FIGHT 
WHO BETTER TO PRACTISE ON THAN YOUR OWN MOTHER 
THE PLAINS ARE A DANGEROUS PLACE TO GROW UP 
IF NAABI CAN LEARN HOW TO SURVIVE FROM THE QUEEN HERSELF 
WHAT BETTER START IN LIFE 
IT IS WILDEBEEST THAT KEEP ALIVE THE PLAINS OF THE SOUTHERN SERENGETI 
BUT NOW THERE ARE NONE 
THEY ARE IN THE NORTH NOT DUE BACK FOR NEARLY A YEAR 
WITHOUT THEM THERE IS LITTLE FOR THE PREDATORS TO EAT 
SO THE LIONS ARE AS HUNGRY AS THE HYENAS 
THE ACACIA PRIDE LIVES CLOSE TO NAABI'S NDUTU CLAN 
THESE ARE HARD TIMES FOR THE LIONS 
TOO MANY MONTHS WITHOUT ENOUGH FOOD HAS MADE THEM LEAN AND IRRITABLE 
THE LIONESSES HAVE CUBS TO PROTECT 
AND THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE ADVANCES OF A FOOLISH TEENAGER 
HE IS A THREAT AND NEEDS DEALING WITH 
SILLY BOY 
NOTHING IS MORE DANGEROUS TO A HYENA THAN AN ANGRY LION 
LIONS HATE HYENAS AND NEED NO EXCUSE TO KILL THEM 
THE OLD HYENA QUEEN LOST A LEG TO LIONS 
IT STRIPPED HER OF HER RANK 
BUT THE HYENAS' STRONG FAMILY BONDS PROTECT THEM 
THE CLAN SYSTEM ONLY WORKS IF EVERYONE KNOWS THEIR PLACE 
IF YOU ARE A MALE FORGET IT YOU ARE AT THE BOTTOM 
HIGHER RANKING FEMALES FORCE THE UNDERDOGS TO COCK THEIR LEGS 
SO THAT THEY CAN SNIFF THEIR GENITALS 
THIS WEIRD EXTENDED CLITORIS IS A QUIRK OF SPOTTED HYENAS 
AND MAKES THE GIRLS LOOK LIKE BOYS 
NAABI MAKES HER FIRST VISIT TO THE WATER HOLE NEAR HER DEN 
MAYBE SHE DOES HAVE ELEPHANT DUNG STUCK TO HER WHISKERS 
AND IS ONLY THREE MONTHS OLD 
BUT SHE IS SECOND IN COMMAND SO EVERYONE SHOWS HER RESPECT 
NAABI'S TAIL IS UP SO THE LOWER RANKING HYENA 
HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO COCK A LEG AND BE INSPECTED 
SUCH ACCEPTANCE OF DOMINANCE AND HIERARCHY 
MEANS THAT THE HYENA CLAN IS SURPRISINGLY PEACEFUL 
ABOVE ALL RANK IS A RUTHLESS WAY OF DECIDING WHO FEEDS FIRST 
AND THE TWO PRINCESSES HAVE WORKED OUT RIGHTS TO THE ROYAL NIPPLE 
THE OTHER POOR CUBS THAT SHARE THE DEN WITH NAABI AND HER SISTER 
DON'T GET THE SAME ATTENTION 
THEY ARE LEFT UNDERGROUND 
WHILE THEIR MOTHERS TRAVEL GREAT DISTANCES TO FIND FOOD 
FOLLOWING THE ROADS OF HUMANS 
THEY TREK NORTH TO FIND THE WILDEBEEST HERDS 
DAYS BETWEEN FEEDS LEAVES THE CUBS HUNGRY 
BUT HYENA MILK IS SEVEN TIMES MORE NUTRITIOUS THAN COW'S MILK 
SO HYENAS CAN LEAVE THEIR CUBS UNFED LONGER THAN ANY OTHER MAMMAL 
IF YOU ARE QUEEN YOU CAN STAY PUT 
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE WHATEVER FOOD CAN BE FOUND NEAR THE DEN 
IF SHE LIKES 
NAABI'S MUM CAN KNOCK A CHEETAH OFF ITS KILL AND IT'S ALL HERS 
IT MEANS SHE GETS MORE TIME WITH NAABI AND HER SISTER 
TO CARE FOR THEM AND PROTECT THEM 
SO THEIR ADVANTAGE JUST GROWS AND GROWS 
NAABI IS BETTER FED THAN ALL THE OTHER HYENA CUBS 
SO SHE'S FITTER AND STRONGER 
BUT SHE WILL HAVE TO FILL HER MOTHER'S SHOES 
SO NAABI NEEDS TO DEVELOP SKILLS TO MATCH HER STRENGTH 
NOW THAT SHE'S FOUR MONTHS OLD SHE CAN SPEND MORE TIME ABOVE GROUND 
THE JOURNEY FROM BABY TO PREDATOR CAN BEGIN 
NAABI'S MOTHER FEEDS HER AND HER LITTLE SISTER IN THE EVENING 
IT IS A RELAXED AFFAIR A TIME TO FEED AND DOZE 
THIS EVENING THE QUEEN IS NOT HAPPY 
LIONS 
THIS IS TOO CLOSE TO THE DEN 
TOO CLOSE TO HER CUBS 
IF THE LIONS FIND NAABI AND THE OTHER CUBS THEY WILL KILL THEM 
THEY MUST GO 
THE ACACIA PRIDE LIONESSES ALSO HAVE LITTLE ONES TO PROTECT 
BUT THERE ARE ONLY FOUR OF THEM 
AND WHEN NIGHT FALLS NAABI'S MUM CAN CALL UPON AN ARMY OF FORTY 
FOOLISH LIONS 
YOU SHOULDN'T UPSET A QUEEN 
OTHERS RESPOND 
NAABI'S MUM MAKES A PRE EMPTIVE STRIKE 
CAUGHT OUT ON THE PLAINS WITHOUT A MALE TO PROTECT THEM 
THE LIONS ARE IN BIG TROUBLE 
TO SAVE THEIR SKINS THE LION CUBS TRY TO GET OFF THE GROUND 
EVEN THE LIONESSES BECOME DESPERATE 
THIS NIGHT BELONGS TO THE HYENAS 
LONG LIVE THE QUEEN 
THE NEXT DAY THE LIONS MOVE THEIR CUBS TO A SAFER PART OF THEIR TERRITORY 
THE BITTER RIVALRY BETWEEN LIONS AND HYENAS HOWEVER IS FAR FROM OVER 
THE NDUTU CLAN CAN NEVER LET DOWN ITS GUARD 
AT JUST SIX MONTHS OLD NAABI IS EXPECTED TO BE ANOTHER PAIR OF EYES 
ANOTHER NOSE ANOTHER PAIR OF EARS FOR THE NDUTU CLAN 
FORTUNATELY SHE'S A SMART PRINCESS SO SHE'S QUICK TO COPY HER MOTHER 
SHE LEARNS TO WATCH THE VULTURES 
HYENAS NEED VULTURES 
THEIR EYES IN THE SKY 
FOR WHERE THEY FALL SHE WILL FIND FOOD 
THIS IS THE FIELDCRAFT THAT WILL SAVE HER FROM STARVATION 
THE ONE THING THAT CAN UNDO ALL THIS GOOD WORK IS A MALE LION 
THE CLAN CAN DEAL WITH FEMALES BUT A LARGE MALE IS A DIFFERENT STORY 
HER MOTHER AND OTHER ADULT HYENAS GO IN 
BUT NAABI HOLDS BACK 
HE WILL KILL HER IF HE WANTS TO 
SO SHE'S WISE TO KEEP HER DISTANCE 
SHE MUST LEARN BY WATCHING OTHERS 
ANOTHER MALE LION THE TEENAGER 
HE CAN ALSO SEE THE VULTURES SMELL THE FLESH HEAR THE HYENAS 
NAABI HAS DROPPED HER GUARD 
HAD IT BEEN AN ADULT MALE WITH A BIT MORE CONFIDENCE 
NAABI WOULD BE DEAD 
THE DRY SEASON PRESSES ON 
SCORCHING THE EARTH STEALING THE WATER 
MANY OF THE HYENAS ARE SUFFERING NOW 
BUT NOT NAABI'S MUM 
NOT NAABI 
THEY'VE FOUND A DEAD TOPI 
AND THEY AND THE HIGH RANKING FEMALES ARE EATING THE BEST BITS 
WITH A FULL BELLY THE PRINCESS HAS TIME TO RELAX AND PLAY 
WHILST THE LESS PRIVILEGED VIE FOR SCRAPS 
SHE'S BREEZED THROUGH HARD TIMES 
WHERE OTHERS HAVE STRUGGLED TO SURVIVE 
TOWARDS DECEMBER RAIN SHOWERS SWEEP SOUTH FROM KENYA 
AND FINALLY QUENCH THE THIRST OF THE LAND 
GOOD NEWS FOR THE NDUTU CLAN 
GOOD NEWS FOR EVERYONE 
IN THEIR WAKE THE RAINS LEAVE GRASS 
LUSH GREEN GRASS FOR AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE 
THE GREAT MIGRATION IS NEAR 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND TONS OF FRESH MEAT IS COMING 
THEY CAN SMELL IT ON THE WIND 
LIKE A MASSING ARMY A MILLION AND A HALF WILDEBEEST ARRIVE 
ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVEMENTS OF ANIMALS ANYWHERE ON EARTH 
NAABI HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE 
RIDERS ON THE STORM 
RIDERS ON THE STORM 
INTO THIS HOUSE WE'RE BORN 
INTO THIS WORLD WE'RE THROWN 
LIKE A DOG WITHOUT A BONE 
AN ACTOR OUT ON LOAN 
RIDERS ON THE STORM 
YEAH 
THIS TIME OF YEAR IS CRUCIAL FOR NAABI AND HER CLAN 
IT IS A TIME TO FATTEN UP 
WHEN THE WILDEBEEST ARRIVE THEY CALVE 
THE BABIES ARE VERY 
BUT THEIR PREDATORS ARE NOT BLESSED WITH ANY COVER TO STALK THEM FROM 
WHICH GIVES THE WILDEBEEST AN ADVANTAGE 
IT IS THE WILDEBEEST THAT KEEP THE PLAINS ALIVE 
THEY FEED THE PREDATORS FEED THE GRASS TRIM IT AND WEED IT 
WITH A STRANGE COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS 
THEY SEEM TO KNOW WHERE THE BEST GRASS IS TO BE FOUND 
TOGETHER THEY MOVE THROUGH THE VASTNESS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS 
FOLLOWING THE RAINS 
FORMING LINES THAT CAN STRETCH FOR OVER THIRTY MILES LONG 
AND HERDS TEN MILES WIDE 
IF THE NDUTU CLAN ARE LUCKY THEY WILL STAY IN THEIR AREA FOR A WHILE 
IF NOT THE WILDEBEEST COULD BE GONE IN A FEW DAYS 
THE HUGE BUILD UP OF FOOD BELOW NAABI HILL 
HAS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTIONS OF AN ACACIA PRIDE LIONESS 
SHE SLINKS BACK INTO THE NDUTU CLAN'S AREA 
SHE CAN AFFORD TO BE PICKY 
TAKE HER TIME 
SHE SINGLES OUT A WILDEBEEST THAT IS PERFECT FOR HER NEEDS 
HEALTHY ADULT NOT TOO BIG TO CAUSE HER PROBLEMS 
BEFORE THE LAST BREATHS HAVE EVEN LEFT THE WILDEBEEST 
NAABI'S MOTHER APPEARS 
SHE TOO HAS BEEN WATCHING WAITING 
NAABI FOLLOWS HER MOTHER IN 
THIS IS RISKY BUT IT'S A CRUCIAL NEW EXPERIENCE FOR HER 
OTHER HYENAS APPEAR AS IF FROM NOWHERE 
ALONE WITH THE KILL 
THE LIONESS STANDS NO CHANCE AGAINST NAABI'S MOTHER AND HER CLAN 
SHE'S JUST ANOTHER MEAL TICKET 
BATTLE CRIES ECHO ACROSS THE PLAINS 
CALLS FOR REINFORCEMENTS NEVER GO UNHEEDED 
YOUNG AND OLD THE TROOPS COME RUNNING 
THE ACACIA PRIDE CAN HEAR THE COMMOTION TOO 
SOON THERE ARE LIONS EVERYWHERE 
IT IS NOT UNTIL DARK HOWEVER 
THAT NAABI'S MUM GETS THE CONFIDENCE TO STEP UP THE PRESSURE 
THEY TAUNT THE LIONS WHO ARE ONLY JUST HOLDING THEIR NERVE 
NAABI HANGS BACK PERHAPS TOO YOUNG TO BE TAKING SUCH RISKS 
HER MOTHER IS PERHAPS TAKING TOO MANY 
THERE ARE TWO YOUNG MALE LIONS BUT NAABI'S MUM RUNS RINGS AROUND THEM 
THESE GUYS DON'T HAVE THE BALLS TO DEAL WITH THE DETERMINED NDUTU CLAN 
AND DESPITE THEIR SIZE THEY KNOW WHO HAS THE UPPER HAND 
BUT THE DEVIL LURKS IN THE DARKNESS 
THE PRIDE MALES APPEAR AND THE BALANCE OF POWER SUDDENLY SHIFTS 
THE QUEEN 
GRABBED BY THE NECK 
SHE'S DOOMED 
IT IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN ACT OF AGGRESSION 
AND THE LION SEEMS TO RELISH IT 
HER MOTHER IS DEAD 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIONS AND HYENAS IS A DARK AND BRUTAL ONE 
NAABI HAS LEARNED THAT IT IS NO RESPECTER OF RANK 
WE CAN ONLY GUESS WHAT NAABI FEELS 
BUT IN A SOCIETY WHERE BONDS ARE EVERYTHING 
SHE MUST FEEL THE LOSS 
SHE HAS NOT JUST LOST HER MOTHER 
SHE HAS LOST EVERYTHING 
SHE DOESN'T YET HAVE THE AGE OR EXPERIENCE 
TO TAKE OVER THE REINS OF POWER 
HER DESTINY AS QUEEN HAS BEEN DENIED 
NOW HER POSITION IN THE CLAN WILL BE DECIDED BY WHO HER ALLIES ARE 
IF THEY ARE HIGH RANKING AND CLOSE SHE WILL BE O. K. 
IF THEY ARE NOT SHE COULD TUMBLE 
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM 
THE CLAN NEEDS A LEADER OR IT WILL FALL APART 
THE NEXT DAY HIGH RANKING FEMALES BEGIN TO SQUABBLE FOR POWER 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE 
NAABI'S FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN 
NOW THE OTHER CLAN MEMBERS EAT FIRST AND THERE IS NOTHING SHE CAN DO ABOUT IT 
NAABI IS ONLY JUST WEANED SO SHE NEEDS ALL THE PROTEIN SHE CAN GET 
BUT SHE'S DENIED IT 
SO SHE MUST SCAVENGE WITH JACKALS AND VULTURES 
BUT SHE GETS NOTHING BUT OFFAL AND ENTRAILS AND THE ODD RIB BONE 
BUT ONLY AFTER THE JACKAL HAS FINISHED WITH IT 
HER FALL FROM GRACE COULD NOT HAVE COME AT A WORSE TIME 
FOUR WEEKS AFTER THEY ARRIVE 
THE WILDEBEEST LEAVE THE PLAINS OF THE SOUTHERN SERENGETI 
NOW THE LION AND CHEETAH MUST GO BACK TO HUNTING WHATEVER THEY CAN 
NAABI HAS A MOST IMPORTANT DECISION TO MAKE 
TO STAY AND STRUGGLE FEEDING ON SCRAPS AND BONES 
OR TO FOLLOW THE HERDS TRY HER LUCK ALONE 
IF SHE MAKES THE WRONG DECISION SHE WILL STARVE AND DIE 
BUT WITH AN EMPTY BELLY AND NONE OF THE SKILLS TO FEED IT 
NAABI DECIDES TO FOLLOW THE HERDS 
SHE HEADS NORTH 
IT IS A HUGE RISK TO TAKE 
THE WORLD BEYOND THE DEN BEYOND HER NDUTU CLAN BORDERS 
IS A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE 
HERE THERE ARE MANY OTHER HYENAS 
COMMUTERS LIVING WITHOUT THE BACKUP OF A CLAN 
KILLING AND SCAVENGING WHAT THEY CAN 
LOST IN THE CONFUSION OF THE HERDS 
THIS YOUNG CALF IS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE 
NAABI IS NO MATCH FOR EVEN A BABY WILDEBEEST THOUGH 
SHE'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH NOT FAST ENOUGH 
IT IS THE OLDER HYENAS WHO BENEFIT 
TO SURVIVE ON THE PLAINS 
YOU MUST USE YOUR BRAINS AS WELL AS YOUR LEGS 
NAABI CAN ONLY WATCH 
BUT BY WATCHING SHE WILL LEARN 
WITHIN THREE DAYS OF BEING BORN A WILDEBEEST CALF CAN OUTRUN A HYENA 
SHE MUST RESORT TO SCAVENGING BUT THAT BRINGS ITS OWN PROBLEMS 
NONE OF THESE HYENAS IS RESIDENT 
LIKE HER THEY ARE JUST PASSING THROUGH 
NAABI DOESN'T FACE MUCH AGGRESSION WHEN SHE JOINS THE CROWD 
BUT SHE'S NOT ALLOWED TO EAT 
BEING A PRINCESS MEANS NOTHING TO THESE WILD OPPONENTS 
SIZE AND AGE DICTATE RANK HERE NOT SILVER SPOONS 
THE ARRIVAL OF THE RESIDENTS HOWEVER 
REMINDS THE TRAVELLING HYENAS WHO THIS MEAT BELONGS TO 
NAABI AND THE OTHERS SEEM TO DISAGREE 
FINALLY SHE SNATCHES A MEAL 
MAYBE NOT 
THESE TWO RESIDENTS CAN EASILY CALL FOR BACKUP 
AND THE OTHER HYENAS KNOW IT 
FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS SHE CONTINUES FOLLOWING THE HERDS 
DRIVEN BY THE NEED FOR FOOD 
SCRAPING AN EXISTENCE 
THE WILDEBEEST HEAD FAR INTO THE NORTH 
AND EVENTUALLY NAABI STOPS FOLLOWING 
PERHAPS SHE'S HELD BACK NOT WANTING TO WANDER TOO FAR FROM HOME 
FOOD BECOMES SCARCE ALL OF A SUDDEN 
THE ANIMALS THAT STAY TOPI HARTEBEEST AND ZEBRA 
ARE TOO LARGE AND FAST FOR NAABI TO DEAL WITH 
SHE REMEMBERS HER MOTHER HOW SHE ALWAYS WATCHED THE CHEETAHS 
THE HYENA IS NO FOOL 
WHY HUNT WHEN OTHERS CAN DO IT FOR YOU 
THE CHEETAHS GAMBLE THEIR PRECIOUS REMAINING ENERGY 
ON THE LARGEST ANTELOPE OF ALL THE ELAND 
IF THE CHEETAHS SEE HER THEY WILL STOP HUNTING IMMEDIATELY 
SO SHE WAITS WATCHES AND LISTENS 
PERHAPS THE CHEETAH HAS MADE MANY SACRIFICES FOR ITS SPEED 
IT HAS A VERY SMALL HEAD IT IS NOT THE SMARTEST CAT 
EVENTUALLY NAABI'S PATIENCE PAYS OFF 
THE CHEETAHS HAVE MADE A KILL 
NAABI IS UNSURE THEY DO SEEM BIG 
A WISE CHEETAH WOULD NOT WASTE ITS ENERGY 
BUT THE YOUNG MALE CANNOT HELP HIMSELF 
ONE BITE FROM NAABI'S POWERFUL JAWS COULD FINISH HIM 
HUNGER DRIVES HER 
SHE NEEDS A MEAL AND SHE WILL RISK A BIT OF A BEATING TO GET ONE 
YOU SEE THE CHEETAH IS A WEAK ANIMAL 
NAABI HAS JUST DISCOVERED THIS FOR HERSELF 
SHE HAS DONE WELL TO TAKE ON FOUR CHEETAHS BEFORE SHE IS EVEN TWO 
SHE HAS A MEAL ALL TO HERSELF 
BUT THERE ARE SPIES IN THE GRASS 
OTHER HYENAS APPEAR AS IF FROM NOWHERE 
WITHIN MINUTES NAABI HAS LOST IT ALL 
HER HARD EARNED MEAL IS STOLEN 
THESE ARE BITTER LESSONS TO LEARN 
NAABI SPENDS HER DAYS SLEEPING 
IT IS TOO HOT TO DO ANYTHING ELSE 
ONE DAY WEAK AND EMPTY BELLIED 
THE VULTURES TALK TO HER AND SHE SMELLS FRESH MEAT 
SHE KNOWS TO HEAD TO WHERE THEY LAND 
IF IT IS BRAVADO THEN NAABI IS STUPID 
MAYBE IT IS JUST DESPERATION 
WHICH FORCES HER TO TAKE AN IMPOSSIBLE RISK 
WITHOUT HER CLAN BEHIND HER SHE'S JUST AN UPSTART TO A LIONESS 
SHE'S FINDING IT HARD TO SCAVENGE AND SHE HAS NO SUCCESS HUNTING 
FOR HER TO CONTINUE ALONE WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS 
SHE REALISES THIS NOW 
NAABI BELONGS NOWHERE AND HAS NO RIGHT TO FOOD 
ALONE IT IS AS THOUGH SHE IS ONLY HALF ALIVE 
SHE HAS ALMOST BECOME HOW THE AFRICAN PEOPLE DESCRIBE THE HYENA 
ROHO KWA MAITI 
SPIRIT OF THE DEAD 
SHE MUST MAKE A DECISION 
TO STAY ALONE IN THE EMPTY PLAINS OF THE NORTH 
OR RETURN TO HER CLAN IN THE EMPTY PLAINS OF THE SOUTH 
EVEN THOUGH SHE FACES A JOURNEY OF NEARLY ONE HUNDRED MILES 
SHE DECIDES TO HEAD BACK 
SHE HAS LEARNED THE LESSONS A MOTHER MIGHT HAVE TAUGHT HER 
BUT SHE HAS HAD TO LEARN THEM THROUGH HER OWN BITTER EXPERIENCE 
PERHAPS SHE WEARS A TOUGHER SKIN NOW 
PERHAPS SHE'S A LITTLE WISER 
WHEN SHE REACHES THE NAABI HILLS SHE KNOWS SHE'S HOME 
BUT SHE HAS NO IDEA HOW SHE WILL FIT BACK IN 
THE OTHERS RECOGNISE HER INSTANTLY 
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S BEEN AWAY FOR MONTHS 
AND THEY WASTE NO TIME IN PUTTING HER IN HER PLACE 
SHE'S RANK AND FILE NOW AND MUST GROVEL TO THE NEW QUEEN 
BUT SHE'S NOT ROCK BOTTOM 
THE NEW QUEEN IS A COUSIN OF HER MOTHER'S 
SO NAABI GETS A LITTLE EXTRA STATUS 
NOT A LOT BUT ENOUGH TO RAISE HER ABOVE THE RIB BONES 
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT HER CHANCES OF SURVIVAL ARE NOW MUCH GREATER 
NAABI IS AN ADULT NOW 
TO STAY PART OF THIS TEAM AND THE BENEFITS IT BRINGS 
SHE MUST PULL HER WEIGHT 
WHEN THE WILDEBEEST ARRIVE 
OUR LITTLE PRINCESS GETS THE CHANCE TO PROVE HER WORTH 
IT HAS BEEN A LONG JOURNEY FROM THE CAREFREE GAMES OF HER CUBHOOD 
BUT THE HOURS OF FIGHTING PLAYING AND RUNNING ABOUT 
AFTER SISTERS AND COUSINS HAVE MADE HER READY FOR THIS MOMENT 
FOR NOW SHE RUNS LIKE THE WIND 
ONCE UPON A TIME NAABI HAD MERELY INHERITED THE RIGHT TO EAT 
THE RIGHT TO PROTECTION AND SUPPORT WITHIN THE NDUTU CLAN 
NOW SHE HAS EARNED IT 
WELL IT'S ALL RIGHT 
RIDIN' AROUND IN THE BREEZE 
WELL IT'S ALL RIGHT 
IF YOU LIVE THE LIFE YOU PLEASE 
THANKS TO THE GREAT MIGRATION 
THE NDUTU CLAN HAD FULL BELLIES FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS 
THERE WAS AN UNEASY TRUCE WITH THE ACACIA PRIDE 
A SHORT LIVED ONE OF COURSE 
SIT AROUND AND WONDER WHAT TOMORROW WILL BRING 
MAYBE A DIAMOND RING 
THE NEW QUEEN SEEMED TO LIKE THE OLD QUEEN 
WELL IT'S ALL RIGHT 
EVERY DAY IS JUDGMENT DAY 
MAYBE SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD AWAYS 
AND EVENTUALLY NAABI HAD A GIRL OF HER OWN 
WHO KNOWS 
NAABI MAY EVEN WORK HER WAY BACK UP TO THE TOP OF THE PACK ONE DAY 
AND LIFE ON THE PLAINS BENEATH NAABI HILL 
CONTINUES THE SAME AS IT HAS DONE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
IN TWO WEEKS' TIME 
NATURAL WORLD IS ON THE TRAIL OF THE SPECTACLED BEAR HIGH IN THE ANDES 
ONCE THOUGHT TO BE A PLACID VEGETARIAN THIS SECRETIVE CREATURE 
IS NOW AT THE HEART OF A SCIENTIFIC CONTROVERSY 
WELL IT'S ALL RIGHT 
EVEN IF THE SUN DON'T SHINE 
WELL IT'S ALL RIGHT
