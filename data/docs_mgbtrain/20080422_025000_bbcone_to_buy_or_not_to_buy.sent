LEADED WINDOWS ARE NICE YEAH 
THEY ARE SPOTTING THE ORIGINAL FEATURES AND LOVING THOSE FEATURES 
OH THIS IS A GOOD OPEN AREA IT'S HUGE ISN'T IT 
NICE BIG KIND OF BAY WINDOW AS WELL OH WOW LOOK AT THE FIRE 
OH THAT'S GOOD NOT SURE ABOUT THE OH YES 
WHAT IS THAT SIXTIES 
BECAUSE IN THAT DINING ROOM YOU'VE GOT THAT VERY GEOMETRIC RETRO WALLPAPER IT FREAKS ME OUT 
IT COULD SEND YOU GIDDY IT FREAKS ME OUT IT COULD MAKE YOU GIDDY 
IT'S LIKE YEAH MAN 
I'D HAVE TO CHANGE THAT AND PROBABLY THE COLOUR AS WELL 
THAT'S ALL A BIT LIKE ABIGAIL'S PARTY

DARK COLOURS AGAIN ISN'T IT 
QUITE A DARK ROOM YEAH IT REALLY IS A DARK ROOM 
DOESN'T FEEL AS BIG AS THE FRONT ROOM DOES IT 
IF YOU WERE GOING TO DECORATE THAT ROOM WHAT COLOUR WOULD YOU GO FOR 
I WOULD GO PLUM WITH A HINT OF MINT 
NO TOO DARK NOT KEEN ON THE FIREPLACE 
I LIKE THE STOVE THE FIREPLACE ITSELF YEAH FITS WITH THE HOUSE 
FITS WITH THE PERIOD OF THE HOUSE DON'T LIKE IT DON'T LIKE IT 
WHO'S WEARING THE TROUSERS IN THIS RELATIONSHIP I THINK AMY 
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT LEADED WINDOWS 
YEAH NOT A BIG FAN OF LEADED WINDOWS 
THEY LIKE THEIR WINDOWS AND THEIR PETROL UNLEADED 
SMALL KITCHEN 
IT'S NOT HORRENDOUSLY SMALL 
IT'S STILL BIGGER THAN OURS THAT WE'VE GOT 
IF THEY THINK THAT KITCHEN IS TOO SMALL IT HAS POTENTIAL 
THE CURRENT OWNER WAS GOING TO DO IT TO EXTEND 
I QUITE LIKE THIS OLD WHATEVER IT IS PANTRY LARDERY STORAGE AREA 
STORAGE WHAT DO YOU THINK IS MY FAVOURITE FEATURE IN THAT KITCHEN 
THE OVEN NOPE BECAUSE YOU LIKE A BIT OF MUSHY PIZZA 
NOPE NO BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF CUPBOARD SPACE LINDS 
I'LL GET THERE I'M GOING TO TELL YOU

OH YOU CAN HAVE ALL YOUR BITS IN THERE OH WOW

MY FAVOURITE FEATURE IN THAT KITCHEN IS THE ORIGINAL NINETEEN THIRTIES 
CHOCOLATE BAR CUPBOARDS 
CUPBOARDS CUPBOARDS 
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE GOT A GARAGE OUT THERE 
OH YEAH O. K. USEFUL 
IT'S LIKE A LOVELY OLD COACH HOUSE ISN'T IT 
I DO LIKE THIS STAIRCASE THOUGH THE WOODEN STAIRCASE IS GOOD YEAH 
THIS IS YOUR CHOICE RIGHT I AM ENVIOUS OF YOUR FIND 
TOILET SEPARATE FROM THE BATHROOM SEPARATE TOILET THAT'S GOOD 
SMALLEST ROOM IN THE HOUSE IT'S VERY SMALL 
SMALL'S A WORD THAT'S BEEN USED A LOT 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A WORD THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN USED ANYWHERE IN THIS HOUSE 
WE SHOULD HAVE VETOED THAT WE SHOULD 
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN FELT 
I'M NOT ALLOWING THEM TO USE THE WORD SMALL FROM HERE ON IN 
THE BATHROOM FITS ITS PERIOD OF THE HOUSE 
CORNER BATH SIT IN THE CORNER BATH 
YOU DON'T LIKE CORNER BATHS DO YOU 
I HAVE AN AVERSION TO CORNER BATHS I'M AFRAID 
DO YOU KNOW WHY A CORNER BATH WOULD BE PERFECT FOR THOSE GIRLS 
I KNOW WHY I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHY 
BECAUSE THEY COULD WASH ALL THEIR CHROME BITS FROM THEIR BIKES IN THE BATHTUB 
I LIKE THESE CUPBOARDS IT'S A GOOD KIND OF STORAGE I. SN'T IT 
DO YOU KNOW I'D STRIP THEM ALL DOWN DO YOU THINK MANY BIKERS WILL TAKE THEIR WHEELS OFF AT NIGHT 
POP THEM IN THE BATH FOR A SOAK OCCASIONALLY 
OCCASIONALLY A BIKER WILL TAKE A WHEEL OFF HIS BIKE AND WASH IT IN A CORNER BATH DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
ARE YOU A BIKER OUT THERE WOULD YOU DO THAT 
I WOULD WANT TO KNOCK THROUGH PROBABLY 
WHAT AND MAKE IT INTO AN L. SHAPE THE BATHROOM AND THE TOILET IN 
TALK TO THEM KRISTIAN IF YOU'RE RESTORING A BIKE OR WANTING TO CLEAN 
A BIT OFF YOU CAN UNBOLT BITS AND POP IT IN THE BATH GIVE IT A SCRUB 
HAVE YOU SEEN BIKERS BEFORE 
WOODEN FLOORS AGAIN I THINK THE WHOLE PLACE HAS WOODEN FLOORS DOESN'T IT 
I'M LOVING THE WOODEN FLOORS YEAH IT'S NOT A BAD SIZE THOUGH IT'S BIG 
IT'S DEFINITELY A DOUBLE ROOM 
WELL IT IS A DOUBLE ROOM IT'S GOT A DOUBLE BED IN IT YEAH 
IT'S GOT A BIG OPEN WINDOW FOR LOOKING OUT INTO THE GARDEN 
THIS IS VERY INTERESTING THIS IS THE ONLY ROOM 
WITHOUT ANY KIND OF LEADED GLASS DETAILING AND THEY LIKE IT 
AHH SO THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
LINDSEY I THINK WE'D HAVE TO DO AN ENTIRE 
REDECORATION IN TERMS OF COLOUR IN THIS HOUSE YEAH 
OH MY GOODNESS FIREPLACE 
ANOTHER GREAT THING IN THAT ROOM IS THE NINETEEN THIRTIES FIREPLACE 
NOW YOU SEE THIS IS WHERE YOU AND I DIFFER 
THAT IS HORRID 
IF ANYBODY WAS TO RIP THAT OUT I WOULD OPENLY WEEP BECAUSE WE 
PREPARE TO WEEP KRISTIAN BECAUSE OLD AMY WOULD SMASH THAT OUT WITH A JACKHAMMER 
WELL SEE I DON'T MIND IT IT'S A THIRTIES HOUSE 
ARGUMENT IN THE BEDROOM 
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT 
IT'S GOING TO BE ORIGINAL 
IT LOOKS LIKE A CHILD HAS PICKED UP SOME YELLOW AND BROWN PAINT AND GONE SHHHHHHHH ON THE TILES 
THIS IS CRUEL OH MY GOODNESS COLOUR COLOUR 
COLOUR COLOUR I HOPE YOU KNOW A GOOD PAINTER LINDSEY 
FRENCH MUSTARD 
MUSTARD DEFINITELY MUSTARD 
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A BIG HAMBURGER 
WHAT'S SO WRONG THEY'VE PAINTED IT FOR A KID 
HE LOVES A LITTLE BIT OF MUSTARD TO PEP HIM ALONG 
AN ARTIST SURELY SHOULD APPRECIATE COLOUR 
I'D WANT TO HAVE A BIT MORE ROOM TO SPREAD OUT MY BITS AND PIECES AND SPLASH PAINT AROUND AND THINGS 
NOT THIS COLOUR PAINT THOUGH 
YOU'D HAVE TO YOU REALLY WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE IT OH MY GOODNESS 
I THOUGHT THEY WERE SLIGHTLY UNFAIR ON THIS HOUSE 
I THINK WE NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH THEM MORE THAN SLIGHTLY THEY WERE BRUTAL 
AH LINDSEY AND AMY I AM CONFUSED WITH YOU PAIR 
ASIDE FROM THE PAINT IT'S A GOOD HOUSE YEAH 
IT'S A GOOD SPACE ALL RIGHT 
YOU HAVE THIS AREA NOW THIS IS GREAT THIS IS FOR THE IRON HORSES 
I'VE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER IDEA FOR THE OLD BIKER GANG THAT YOU COULD HAVE IN THERE THE VROOM VROOM VIXENS 
TRIPLE V. TRIPLE V. 
UM SO IN HERE THIS COULD BE YOUR ARTIST STUDIO OUT THE BACK HERE IT'S GOT POWER IN THERE 
YOU COULD STORE YOUR IRON HORSES IN THERE IT COULD WORK 
IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA CLUBHOUSE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN RULES IN THERE 
THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL HERE 
HERE HE COMES

BUT WILL THE GIRLS GET FIRED UP ABOUT THIS ONE

FANTASTIC IN A KIND OF SEMI RURAL FEELING LOCATION 
LOVELY DELIS CAFE CULTURE 
NO I MEAN FOR ME THERE'S NO

WELL LET'S SEE WHAT OUR BIKER BABES MAKE OF THIS ABODE SHALL WE 
DO YOU FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THIS IS THE CLUBHOUSE FOR THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE IRON MAIDENS 
I THINK IT WELL COULD BE IT'S QUITE A LIGHT OPEN ENTRANCEWAY ISN'T IT 
NOT A FAN OF THE WALLPAPER THOUGH 
NOW THE WAY THIS IS DECORATED IT MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY TO THEIR TASTE 
IT'S MUCH LIGHTER AND BRIGHTER WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM 
WOW THIS IS A BIG OPEN LIVING ROOM 
THEY'VE KNOCKED THE TWO ROOMS TOGETHER 
YOU COULD GET THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE 
AND THE LAST SUPPER TO HAPPEN AT ONCE IN THAT ROOM 
YOU CAN JUST HAVE YOUR DINNER AND MOVE OVER TO HERE TO HAVE YOUR COFFEE I THINK 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT A DINING AREA THAT I OFTEN FEEL LACKS IN MANY PROPERTIES 
TABLE CHAIRS ACCESS TO THE KITCHEN 
NO NO BUT IT'S GOOD OPEN SPACE 
AND OUR SOFAS WOULD FIT EASILY IN HERE AS WELL 
CIRCULATING SPACE 
ENOUGH SPACE IF YOU'RE SITTING DOWN BEHIND YOU TO CIRCULATE 
WITH CANAPES OR COCKTAILS OR A TUREEN OF DUCK SOMETHING JUST SPACE TO MOVE AROUND 
I THINK IT MIGHT BE OVERDOING IT WITH THE 
WITH THIS BRICK I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THIS BRICK 
I WONDER WHAT THIS WAS ORIGINALLY YOU COULD PLASTER OVER IT 
OH WE GOT SOME BRICKETTES THERE WE CAN LOSE THOSE 
THEY'RE A TOUGH GIG THESE PAIR OH YI YI YI YI YI 
OH THAT'S QUITE WEIRD OH THIS IS IS THIS SORT OF LIKE A UTILITY AREA 
IT'S LIKE HAVING TWO KITCHENS NICE VIEW OF THE GARDEN 
GOOD GARDEN YEAH YEAH NICE SIZE 
GO THROUGH HERE 
AH HA HA THAT'S REALLY STRANGE 
THAT IS PECULIAR WHY WOULD YOU WANT TWO SEPARATE KITCHENS 
THE IDEA OF SPLIT KITCHEN 
IN RUDDINGTON ISN'T ROCKING THEIR BOAT NO IT'S NOT 
THERE'S LOTS OF LIGHT ANYWAY IT'S BIG IT'S NOT MY STYLE 
TO MAKE THEM FEEL AT HOME I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT 
I WAS GOING TO POP THESE TWO IN THINKING ABOUT THEIR RABBITS 
IF I POP THAT IN THERE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE SPACE SO MUCH BETTER 
HUGE AREA 
FANTASTIC PARKING AREA BIKES CARS 
CERTAINLY FULFIL THE OFF ROAD PART 
FERRARI IN YOUR DREAMS 
I THINK THIS ONE LIKES YOU OH IT REALLY DOES HE REALLY DOES 
OH MY GOODNESS WHAT'S HIS NAME FLOPSY HELLO FLOPSY 
WHAT A TEENY TINY LANDING I WAS REALLY EXPECTING MORE FROM HERE 
DID YOU NOT THINK THERE'D BE A GREAT BIG HALLWAY I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HUGE 
UPSTAIRS AGAIN FOR ME IT'S LIGHT IT'S TRADITIONAL IT'S GOT THE PERIOD FEATURES 
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BUY INTO IT I'M A BROKEN MAN 
IT'S A BATHROOM ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE A LARGE BATHROOM 
WOW IT'S HUGE ISN'T IT OH HEY THE BATHROOM THE BATHROOM 
THE BATHROOM LISTEN TO THIS IT'S ALL SMELLING OF ROSES NOW 
FROM OUTSIDE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE OLDE WORLDE 
THEN YOU COME INSIDE AND IT'S VERY IT'S JUST TOO MODERN 
IT'S DEFLATED THEY'RE WANTING TO LIVE IN A HISTORICAL MUSEUM 
IT'S TOO MODERN THIS CARPET THAT RUNS THROUGH THE WHOLE THING WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT 
YOU COULD CHANGE IT I SUPPOSE NOT MY COLOUR BUT 
BY THE ART OF DEDUCTION WHAT COLOURS DO THEY ACTUALLY LIKE 
WE'VE GOT THE PALETTE THEY DON'T LIKE MY HOUSE AND THIS HOUSE 
THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE BURNT AMBER THE YELLOW THE BLUE 
THE PEACH THE PEACH OR THE GREEN OF THE OTHER PROPERTY 
THE MOUSTARDE OR THE CATSUP THEY DIDN'T LIKE THAT 
WOW OH LOOK A LITTLE SINK IN THE CORNER 
THE MAGNOLIA OR WHATEVER COLOUR IT IS HAS DEFINITELY GIVE IT AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
STAMP YOUR OWN COLOUR ON IT DON'T YOU REALLY 
ARE THERE ANY OTHER COLOURS 
RED AND YELLOW AND PINK AND GREEN PURPLE AND BLUE AND 
BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT YOU CAN STILL HIRE HIM TO DO CHOIRISTRY 
I CAN SING A RAINBOW SING A RAINBOW 
IT'S WEIRD IT FEELS LIKE AN OLD HOME FROM THE OUTSIDE AND YOU COME IN 
AND IT FEELS LIKE THEY'VE DONE A NEW BUILD IN HERE 
THEY CAN'T GET THEIR HEAD ROUND THE FACT IT'S 
A PERIOD PROPERTY ON THE OUTSIDE BUT MODERN LIVING ON THE INSIDE 
OH FIRST THING YOU NOTICE WHEN YOU COME IN 
NO LINDSEY NO NO NO 
I WOULD LOOK AT THE WARDROBES AND TAKE IT AS AN INDICATION 
OF HOW MUCH STORAGE ONE COULD GET IN THEY HAVE A LOT OF CLUTTER 
AND ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE SMALL FOR A MASTER BEDROOM 
AND I THINK YOU WOULD WANT NOT P. V. C. WINDOWS 
BUT YOU'D WANT SORT OF OLD SASH WINDOWS 
OR NEW WINDOWS DONE IN THE OLD STYLE 
HERE THEY DON'T LIKE THE P. V. C. WINDOWS 
IN THE LAST HOUSE THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE PERIOD LEAD WINDOWS 
HOW DOES ONE WIN OH SOMEBODY'S ARTY 
MY GOODNESS YEAH DEFINITELY AHH 
AHHHH I LOOKED IN THAT ROOM AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT CRAFT IT WAS 
CARD MAKING THE WALLS YOU COULD PAINT EASILY AND HAVE A BIT OF COLOUR THERE'S NOT A LOT TO DO 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PROPORTIONS OF THESE ROOMS 
I EXPECTED I MEAN THEY'RE REALLY HIGH CEILINGS 
I EXPECTED THE ROOMS TO BE BIGGER 
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROPORTIONS NOW 
IT'S SMALLER THAN THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 
SO THEY HAVE DONE IT WHICH IS GOOD OR NOT 
BUT NOT IN THE WAY I'D HOPED FOR 
RIGHT LET'S SEE WHAT THE BOYS ARE UP TO THEN YEAH 
THEY SAID THAT WITH A SIGH 
THEY DID BECAUSE THEY HATED MY HOUSE AND NOW IT WOULD SEEM THEY HATE THIS HOUSE 
SHALL WE SEE WHAT THE GIRLS ARE UP TO ALL RIGHT YEAH HATING US 
SO AMY LET'S FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT YOU DID LIKE FIRST YOU LIKED THE OUTSIDE 
YEAH RIGHT IT HAD LOTS OF POTENTIAL FROM THE OUTSIDE 
LET ME SHOW YOU MORE YOU'VE GOT A PLETHORA OF OUTSIDE BUILDINGS 
YOU'VE GOT ONE THERE FOR THE LAWNMOWER YOU'VE GOT AN OUTSIDE 
TOILET THERE YOU'VE GOT A B. AND AMP B. FOR THE BIRDS THERE WITH A COMPLIMENTARY SEED BUFFET AND THEN AMY WE'VE GOT 
A VERY NICE SUMMER HOUSE THERE AND A VERY CUTE FOLLY AT THE END OF THE GARDEN 
SO WE LIKE THE OUTSIDE I'VE GOT ONE VERY DAMNING QUESTION TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE INSIDE 
AND THAT IS AMY WHAT COLOUR DO YOU LIKE WELL MAGNOLIA'S FINE 
YOU CAN DO THINGS WITH MAGNOLIA MAGNOLIA 
FOR A KIND OF GRAPHIC DESIGN ARTISTRY TYPE PERSON MAGNOLIA IS REALLY NOT OUT THERE IS IT 
PERHAPS A COUPLE OF MURALS ON THE WALL OR SOMETHING OH YI YI YI 
I FEEL THOUGH THAT SOMEHOW I'VE KIND OF MISREAD YOU AND I'VE LET YOU DOWN 
AND I FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT AND FEEL LIKE I SHOULD APOLOGISE 
YEAH ALL RIGHT THEN ALL RIGHT I APOLOGISE 
BUT MAYBE I WILL CHEER YOU UP WHEN YOU HEAR THE PRICE O. K. COME ON THEN 
I HAVE A TIP FOR YOU 
AND A TIP THAT COULD TURN YOUR PROPERTY FROWN UPSIDE DOWN 
NOW YOU'RE IN A BIKER GANG CURRENTLY NAMED THE IRON MAIDENS 
THE IRON MAIDENS WOULD NEED AN AREA FOR THEIR IRON HORSES 
YOU'D NEED A GARAGE WE DON'T HAVE A GARAGE

RIGHT WE HAVE TO STOP SAYING WOW ON AIR FAB IS MY NEW WORD FAB 
LOOK AT IT 
ONE THING I LIKE IS THERE'S SO MUCH ARCHITECTURAL SALVAGE 
SO LOTS OF INTERESTING BITS FROM BANISTERS AND NEWEL POSTS AND 
DOORS AND LEADED GLASS AND BITS AND PIECES TO REALLY GIVE KIND OF CRANK UP THE PERSONALITY 
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE ON THIS SPOT NOTHING HAPPENED 
I HONESTLY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO TELL US SOMETHING REALLY HISTORIC ABOUT THE PLACE YOU KNOW 
OH WELL OH WASHROOM

IT IS UNUSUAL TO HAVE A DOUBLE OPENING DOOR INTO A BATHROOM I LIKE IT

DOUBLE BEDS IN 
THEY ARE GOOD SIZE ROOMS 
THEY ARE NONE OF THEM ARE POKEY NO THEY'RE NOT 
THIS IS REALLY REALLY NICE

THIS IS YOURS IT COMES WITH THE HOUSE AND AS WE GO INTO THE GARAGE YOU WILL NOTICE ONE KEY FACT 
THE OWNER'S GOT BIKES AS WELL BRILLIANT 
SO YOU COULD STORE THEM YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO IMAGINE THEM THERE 
ALSO WE'RE VERY NEAR TO CASTLE DONINGTON 
CASTLE DONINGTON FAMED FOR 
BIKING AND YOU COULD JOIN LITTLE CONVOYS OF BIKES ROUND HERE 
GROW A BEER BELLY EXACTLY SO IT WOULD FIT IN HERE 
YOU'VE GOT THE GARAGE CASTLE DONINGTON THE LIFESTYLE YOU'VE GOT THE HOUSE 
WE JUST NEED TO KNOW THE PRICE 
YEAH WHICH WAY SHALL WE GO TO FIND THAT OUT 
THAT WAY ALL RIGHT LET'S GO 
LINDSEY I AM DELIGHTED AND SHOCKED THAT YOU LIKED SOMETHING WE FOUND 
THE REVERSE PLANNING THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT THE LOUNGE 
UPSTAIRS RATHER THAN DOWNSTAIRS DOES THAT BOTHER YOU 
NO IT'S QUITE NICE BECAUSE IT MEANS YOU CAN SIT UP HERE AND YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE LOOKING IN YEAH 
IT IS A BUSY ROAD THERE BUT BEING UP NO ONE CAN STARE ON IN 
I WAS CONFUSED YOU DIDN'T LIKE LEADED GLASS 
AT ED'S HOUSE AND YET YOU KIND OF LIKE ALL THIS STUFF DON'T YOU 
I DO YEAH WHY WHAT'S MORE APPEALING ABOUT THIS 
OLDE WORLDE OLDE WORLDE MORE DECORATIVE MORE HISTORY 
SHALL I GIVE YOU SOME HISTORY 
THESE LITTLE BITS HERE ALWAYS THE PRETTY BITS DON'T YOU THINK YEAH 
THAT WAS THE CHEAPEST WASTED PIECE OF GLASS 
WHEN THEY SPUN THE GLASS IN THE OLD DAYS THAT WAS THE BIT IN THE MIDDLE 
THEY BREAK OFF AND THROW AWAY AND SO CHEAP GLASS WINDOWS FOR DECORATIVE WOULD KEEP THAT BIT 
SO PUBS VERY CHEAP ESTABLISHMENTS HAD THEIR WINDOWS MADE OF THAT 
I FEEL I'VE EDUCATED YOU ON STAINED GLASS THANK YOU I NEED AN ED AND AN AMY 
INDEED A. S. A. P. DO YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT STAINED GLASS 
WE CAUGHT THE LAST BIT OF THAT WE ACTUALLY FELL ASLEEP DOWN THERE 
GOOD ALL RIGHT I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE PRICE BECAUSE 
NO ONE INTERESTED IN WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS IS THE ONE 
LINDSEY GIVE ME A PRICE FOR THIS HOUSE YOUR BUDGET IS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
I WOULD SAY TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND O. K. 
AMY I THINK I'LL GO FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE TWO HUNDRED NINETY TWO THOUSAND 
O. K. YOU'VE LOST 
BUT IT'S GOOD BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER THAN YOU THINK IT IS 
YOU WERE ONLY OUT BY FIFTY LINDSEY 
IT'S TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY SO IT'S THE SAME PRICE AS MY HOUSE AND YOU GOT LEADED WINDOWS AS WELL 
SO GO AWAY AND MAKE THE DECISION NOW ABOUT WHICH ONE YOU WISH TO TEST DRIVE 
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DECISION 
O. K. ARE YOU READY FOR THIS WE ARE 
BECAUSE WE CAN'T HELP YOU WE'VE GOT TO STAY HERE 
O. K. ALL RIGHT RIGHT LADIES THIS IS EXCITING 
I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THE HISTORY OF WALLPAPER OR I CAN GO BACK TO LEADED GLASS 
NO I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THE WALLPAPER I'M OFF I'M OFF 
NOBODY WANTS TO LISTEN TO ME ALL RIGHT 
HERE'S A QUICK RECAP ABOUT THOSE THREE PROPERTIES FOR YOU AT HOME 
NOW GLASS 
SO WILL AMY AND LINDSEY CHOSE TO DO ANOTHER LAP OF PROPERTY ONE THE STYLISHLY DECORATED 
DETACHED HOUSE IN WOOLERTON ON THE MARKET AT TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
OR WILL THEY DO ANOTHER CIRCUIT OF PROPERTY TWO THE GLORIOUS BAY FRONTED SEMI IN RUDDINGTON 
WITH LOTS OF OUTBUILDINGS TO ACCOMMODATE AMY'S WORKSHOP PRICED BELOW THEIR BUDGET AT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
OR WILL THEY RIDE BACK TO THE WILD CARD IN LONG EATON 
THE CHARMING PROPERTY WITH MORE THAN ENOUGH SPACE AND HEAPS OF CHARACTER ALL FOR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
O. K. LOVELY AMY AND LINDSEY LET'S ALL FEIGN SURPRISE AT YOUR TEST DRIVE CHOICE 
THE WILD CARD REALLY UNBELIEVABLE 
YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO YOUR TEST DRIVE 
NOW THE TO BUY OR NOT PROPERTY SURVEYOR HAS HAD A LOOK 
I MUST STRESS IT'S NOT LEGALLY BINDING 
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE BUT HE HEARD HOW FEISTY YOU WERE AND QUITE FRANKLY HE WAS SCARED 
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOME STUFF 
LOOK UP THERE AND THOSE BRICKS UP THERE THAT ARE VERY VERY OLD 
ARE STARTING TO PERISH BUT THEY'RE OLD THEY'RE ALLOWED TO 
BUT YOU CAN STOP THAT BY RE POINTING IT AND BASICALLY SEALING THE BRICKS ALL RIGHT EASY ED 
O. K. YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WOODWORM IN THAT HOUSE 
NOW HERE'S AN INTERESTING FACT THAT THE SURVEYOR TOLD ME THE HOLE IN THE WOOD 
THAT IS RIDDLED WITH WOODWORM DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE HOLE IS HE KNOWS THE ANSWER 
THE EXIT POINT IT IS WERE YOU GOING TO SAY THAT 
YES HE WAS IT'S THE EXIT POINT 
NOW WE ASSUME THAT IT'S BEEN TREATED OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE FALLEN DOWN YEARS AGO 
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHEN IT WAS TREATED IF THEY'VE GOT CERTIFICATES 
AND BECAUSE IT IS A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE THE HOME INFORMATION PACKS 
YOU MIGHT GET THAT INFORMATION WITHIN THAT PACK SO YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR A SURVEY 
BUT IF THAT'S NOT IN THERE IT WON'T TAKE MUCH TO GET A FELLOW ROUND THERE SUSS IT ALL OUT 
HE'S ITCHING FOR IT TEST DRIVE COME ON SHALL WE DO IT 
ALL RIGHT DO YOU WANT A COUNTDOWN 
DO YOU WANT A COUNTDOWN ARE YOU READY REV UP VROOOM VROOM

BORN TO BE WILD 
AMY'S NOT BEING VERY WILD SHE'S DRAWING 
LINDSEY ONLY SEEMS INTERESTED IN THE OUTSIDE SPACE TO POLISH UP HER BIKE 
AMY LOOKS VERY RELAXED DRAWING THOSE CARTOONS 
SHE'S PROBABLY DRAWING SOMETHING VERY WILD KRISTIAN 
AMY AND LINDSEY IT LOOKED LIKE YOU REALLY ENJOYED YOUR TEST DRIVE 
THERE YOU WERE PLAYING WITH YOUR BIKES AND SKETCHING AWAY LIKE LEONARDO A VINCI

RIGHT O. K. MORE IMPORTANTLY YOU'VE DONE THE TEST DRIVE 
IT'S THE BIG ONE ISN'T IT WE'VE GOT TO ASK THIS TO END EVERY EPISODE AND WE'RE LIKE THIS KRISTIAN AND I 
YOU CAN FEEL THE TENSION O. K. TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY AMY AND LINDSEY 
THAT IS THE TENSE QUESTION 
WELL WE'VE HAD A REALLY GOOD THINK ABOUT IT AND IT TICKS SO MANY BOXES 
YEAH YES IT DOES IT DOES 
IT REALLY REALLY DOES IT REALLY DOES 
BUT WE JUST DON'T THINK WE COULD COPE WITH THE LOCATION 
IF IT WAS JUST A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LOCATION 
I THINK LINDSEY NEEDS TO EXPLAIN SOME OF THIS AS WELL 
YOU'RE LEAVING ALL THE HARD WORK HERE I THINK SHE'S DOING VERY WELL 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER YOU SAY 
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IT'S BEEN BRILLIANT AND I LOVE YOU BOTH 
OH WE LOVE YOU TOO IT'S BEEN AN EMOTIONAL JOURNEY 
I'M SORRY WE HAVEN'T HOUSED YOU BUT YOU KNOW WE GOT A FREE CARTOON OUT OF IT 
I'M PLEASED FOR THAT ALONE 
BUT IT'S POINTED US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
I THINK WE WERE LOOKING AT PROPERTIES THAT WERE TOO YOUNG 
WE NEED THINGS THAT ARE MORE MATURE AND NOW WE'VE FOUND OUR FEET 
SO IT SHOULD MAKE THE HUNT EASIER FOR YOU IN THE FUTURE 
KRISTIAN AND I 
ARE GOING TO LEAVE YOU HERE BUT AS YOU'RE NOT BUYING IT 
YOU WILL HAVE TO LEAVE FAIRLY QUICKLY ALL RIGHT 
ALL RIGHT WE'LL SEE YOU SOON SEE YOU LATER ON BYE BYE 
I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY SHE'S MANAGED TO RENDER YOU IN SUCH A LIFE LIKE MANNER 
THE PLOUGHED BROW THE SALLOW PALLOR 
AND THE RATHER LOOSE AND CASUAL AND SLOPPY ATTEMPT AT TAILORING 
SHE'S GOT IT THERE AND MY CLASSICAL GOOD LOOKS IT'S ALL THERE 
I'M PLEASED SHE HAD ENOUGH INK TO DO 
YOUR NOSE AND CHIN AND THAT WAS A MIRACLE BUT SHE DID IT 
YOU DON'T THINK THEY'RE TOO BIG DO YOU NO NOT AT ALL 
MY BIGGEST CONCERN NOW IS TOMORROW OF COURSE 
TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE GREAT YES WE DIDN'T SUCCEED TODAY 
CLOSE THOUGH WE WERE CLOSE 
IF YOU'RE SAT AT HOME AND YOU'RE STRUGGLING YOU CANNOT FIND YOUR DREAM HOME FOR LOVE NOR MONEY 
THEN PLEASE DON'T HESITATE AND GET IN TOUCH
