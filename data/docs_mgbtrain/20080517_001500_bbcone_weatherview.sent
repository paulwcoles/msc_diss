NOT A GREAT START TO THE WEEKEND RATHER COOL CLOUDY 
AND MANY OF US WILL SEE SOME RAIN 
CLOUDY AND WET FOR MANY OF US TODAY 
AND INDEED ON FRIDAY WE SAW QUITE A BIT OF RAIN 
ACROSS WALES THE MIDLANDS AND NORTHERN ENGLAND 
AND SOME HEAVY SHOWERS ACROSS CORNWALL AND DEVON 
THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM PUSHING ITS WAY OVER 
WILL SPREAD SOME PERSISTENT RAIN 
IN TO THE SOUTHEAST OF ENGLAND 
ELSEWHERE IN THE U. K. THE SHOWERS IN THE SOUTHWEST 
LOSE INTENSITY BUT A FEW STILL BE AROUND 
LIGHT AND PATCHY RAIN ACROSS WALES 
AND NORTHERN ENGLAND AND INTO CENTRAL SCOTLAND 
THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND 
SEES CLEARER SKIES TONIGHT WITH MAYBE SOME FROST 
A LOT OF CLOUD ACROSS WALES FIRST THING 
A FEW SPOTS OF LIGHT RAIN AND DRIZZLE 
LARGELY DRY IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
A LOT OF CLOUD BUT LARGELY DRY 
BRIGHTER SKIES IN TO THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND 
A CHILLY OLD START WITH A TOUCH OF FROST 
ELSEWHERE IN SCOTLAND 
WE START THE DAY WITH A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD 
AND PATCHY RAIN THROUGH THE CENTRAL LOWLANDS 
IN TO THE SOUTHERN UPLANDS 
THE NORTHEAST OF ENGLAND LOOKS PRETTY GRIM 
IT'LL BE GREY BREEZY AND QUITE COOL 
AND THERE'LL BE SOME RAIN 
THE RAIN A BIT MORE PERSISTENT 
IN EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTHEAST 
AT LEAST FOR A TIME DURING THE MORNING 
IT'LL FEEL A BIT DRIER 
THROUGH PARTS OF THE MIDLANDS DOWN TOWARDS BRISTOL 
BUT STILL SHOWERS FROM EARLY ON 
ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST OF ENGLAND 
AS WE GO ON THROUGH THE DAY 
WE'VE GOT A NORTHEASTERLY 
AIRSTREAM COMING DOWN ACROSS THE U. K. 
IT'LL PUSH BRIGHTER WEATHER DOWN ACROSS SCOTLAND 
SO THINGS IMPROVE HERE AND AT THE SAME TIME 
A BAND OF RAIN WILL SLIP FURTHER SOUTH 
AFTER A DAMP OLD START 
ALONG THAT EAST COAST THINGS HOPEFULLY 
DRYING UP AS THAT RAIN PUSHES FURTHER SOUTH 
BRIGHTENING UP NICELY ACROSS MUCH OF CENTRAL SCOTLAND 
AS THAT CLEARER DRIER WEATHER COMES IN 
SOME DECENT SPELLS OF SUNSHINE 
MAYBE A FIFTEEN OR SO IN GLASGOW 
FOURTEEN IN BELFAST IT STAYS RATHER CLOUDY HERE 
WITH ONE OR TWO SHOWERS FOR THE AFTERNOON 
IN WALES IT'S STILL PRETTY CLOUDY FOR THE AFTERNOON 
OUTBREAKS OF RAIN 
PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH 
THE SHOWERS ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST 
WILL BE QUITE FREQUENT IN THE AFTERNOON 
ALONG THE SOUTH COAST ONE OR TWO SHOWERS 
TOP TEMPERATURES FOURTEEN OR SO DEGREES 
LAST WEEKEND WE WERE LOOKING AT TWENTY FIVE OR TWENTY SIX 
SO A SIGNIFICANT DROP COMPARED TO LAST WEEKEND 
THE NORTHEASTERLY WIND 
CONTINUES TO BLOW THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT 
PUSHING THAT RAIN DOWN TO THE SOUTH COAST 
AND CLEARER CONDITIONS FOLLOW 
A TOUCH OF FROST FOR NORTHERN ENGLAND 
NORTHWARD TO START THE DAY ON SUNDAY 
A BIT OF RAIN EARLY ON FOR THE SOUTH COAST 
THAT'LL CLEAR AWAY AND MOST OF US SHOULD HAVE A DRY 
AND BRIGHT DAY ON SUNDAY 
BUT TEMPERATURES STILL STRUGGLING MIDDLE TEENS AT BEST 
IT WILL BE LARGELY FINE FOR THE START OF THE NEW WEEK 
NOT PARTICULARLY WARM AT FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN DEGREES 
BUT IT'S DRY AND BRIGHT WITH SOME SPELLS OF SUNSHINE 
FOR THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE UNITED KINGDOM 
LONDON AT SIXTEEN POSSIBLY SEVENTEEN DEGREES BY TUESDAY 
THAT'S THE WEATHER OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
IF YOU WANT MORE DETAIL IT'S ON THE WEBSITE GOODNIGHT
