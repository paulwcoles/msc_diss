GOOD EVENING WELCOME LIVE TO THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL FOR TONIGHT'S PROM ON B. B. C. FOUR 
WE'LL BE HEARING THREE WORKS ALL WRITTEN IN THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY 
AND COMPOSED BY MUSICIANS EITHER LIVING IN 
OR JUST RETURNED FROM A STATE OF EXILE 
PETER GRIMES THE OPERA BY BENJAMIN BRITTEN 
SUPPLIES US WITH OUR OPENING WORK THE FOUR SEA INTERLUDES 
LATER WE'LL HEAR BOHUSLAV MARTINU'S FOURTH PIANO CONCERTO INCANTATION 
AND AFTER THE INTERVAL PROKOFIEV'S FIFTH SYMPHONY 
ON THE PLATFORM THIS EVENING THE B. B. C. SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
PLAYING UNDER THEIR CHIEF CONDUCTOR JIRI BELOHLAVEK 
THEY'LL BE JOINED FOR THE MARTINU BY THE YOUNG CZECH PIANIST IVO KAHANEK 
HE'S MAKING HIS PROMS DEBUT THIS EVENING 
FIRST THE FOUR SEA INTERLUDES FROM BENJAMIN BRITTEN'S PETER GRIMES 
COMPOSED DURING THE LAST YEARS OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
ITS TRIUMPHANT AND ENDURING SUCCESS MARKING SOMETHING OF A RENAISSANCE FOR OPERA IN POST WAR BRITAIN 
DAWN SUNDAY MORNING MOONLIGHT AND FINALLY A TEMPESTUOUS STORM 
JIRI BELOHLAVEK CONDUCTS THE B. B. C. SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA IN THE FOUR SEA INTERLUDES FROM PETER GRIMES 
FOUR SEA INTERLUDES 
FROM THE OPERA PETER GRIMES BY BENJAMIN BRITTEN 
JIRI BELOHLAVEK CONDUCTING THE B. B. C. SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA LED AT THE PROMS TONIGHT 
BY STEPHEN BRYANT 
IN THIS OPERA THE INTERLUDES LINK NIGHT AND DAY 
LAND AND SEA GOOD AND EVIL 
SCENE CHANGES BY A MASTER OF THE SCENE CHANGE AS THEY WERE ONCE DESCRIBED 
BRITTEN'S OPERA PREMIERED IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
REINSTATING FAITH IN BRITAIN'S CAPACITY TO CREATE MAJOR OPERATIC FIGURES 
NOW THIS YEAR MARKS SOMETHING 
OF A TURNING POINT FOR THE PROMS 
AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE IN CHARGE ITS CURRENT DIRECTOR NICHOLAS KENYON 
IS OFF TO PASTURES NEW AND HE'LL BE REPLACED AT THE PROMS 
BY THE CURRENT CONTROLLER OF RADIO THREE ROGER WRIGHT 
SO WE THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DEDICATE THE INTERVAL TO A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION 
IF I RAN THE PROMS LATER I'LL BE JOINED 
BY THE WRITER GEORGINA BORN THE IMPRESARIO RAYMOND GUBBAY 
AND MUSICIAN GABRIEL PROKOFIEV AMONGST OTHERS 
I HAVE A FEELING 
MY GUESTS WOULD HAVE PLENTY OF IDEAS WERE THEY IN CHARGE AS WE'LL HEAR LATER COMPOSERS BOTH OF THEM 
ZOE MARTLEW CELLIST AS WELL OF COURSE 
STEVE MARTLAND WELCOME BACK TO THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
ZOE THE FOUR SEA INTERLUDES CAN BE A SHOWCASE FOR AN ORCHESTRA DID IT SHOWCASE THE B. B. C. SYMPHONY TONIGHT 
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE ON THEIR BEST FORM I HAVE TO SAY 
WE WERE INTERRUPTED BY SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE AND I WONDERED 
IF HE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SPEEDS A BIT SLOW FOR MY TASTE 
IT MADE IT A BIT LACKLUSTRE 
NEVERTHELESS BRITTEN REALLY IS THE MASTER OF THE SCENE CHANGE 
AND THESE ARE INCREDIBLE LITTLE SYMPHONIC TONE POEMS BEAUTIFUL PIECES 
STEVE SHOULD WE REGARD BRITTEN AS BEING A BRITISH COMPOSER OR AN ENGLISH COMPOSER 
WE HAVEN'T ENOUGH TIME TO DISCUSS THE DISTINCTION I DON'T THINK 
BUT WHAT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF IS WE THINK OF ENGLISH COMPOSERS 
BEING PASTORAL COMPOSERS FROM VAUGHAN WILLIAMS TO BIRTWISTLE 
THE LANDSCAPE HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON THEIR IMAGINATION 
BUT IN FACT 
BRITAIN OR ENGLAND AT LEAST HAS BEEN A MARITIME NATION SINCE HENRY THE EIGHTH 
HEAVE HO AND IT'S SURPRISING 
THAT THERE AREN'T MORE PIECES TO DO WITH THE SEA YES THERE'S A SEA SYMPHONY IN VAUGHAN WILLIAMS 
BUT THESE PIECES ARE THE ONLY STANDARD WORKS I CAN THINK OF THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE SEA 
WELL LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WORK 
BECAUSE HAVING HEARD A PIECE BY I GUESS 
YOU COULD ARGUE THIS BUT I GUESS THE GREATEST BRITISH COMPOSER OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
THE LEADING CZECH COMPOSER 
OF THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS BOHUSLAV MARTINU 
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR HIS FOURTH PIANO CONCERTO 
HE DESCRIBED IT AS BEING A PIANO CONCERTO IN THE FORM OF A SYMPHONY OR A FANTASIA 
SO ZOE I GUESS WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY 
GOING TO GET THE STANDARD VIRTUOSIC THREE MOVEMENT SHOWPIECE 
WE SHOULDN'T LOOK ON THIS AS A STANDARD PIANO CONCERTO AT ALL 
THE FORM IS UNUSUAL IT'S IN TWO MOVEMENTS AND STRUCTURALLY INCREDIBLY FREE 
IT'S IMPROVISATORY IT'S FULL OF RHAPSODIC GESTURES 
IT'S ALMOST ALEATORIC IN SOME BITS AND THE BAR LINES 
JUST SERVE AS ORIENTATION 
MARTINU CALLED THE STYLE DREAM LOGIC 
AND HE WROTE THIS PIECE INCREDIBLY QUICKLY IN A FEW WEEKS 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A STREAM OF MUSICAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN WHICH YOU CAN HEAR ALL SORTS OF INFLUENCES 
THE FACT THAT MARTINU GREW UP IN A CHURCH TOWER IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
IS ONE OF THE THINGS HE'S BEST KNOWN FOR 
BUT WHY ISN'T HIS MUSIC HEARD MORE WIDELY HE WAS PROLIFIC BUT ONLY A FEW WORKS ARE REGULARLY PERFORMED 
THE DOUBLE CONCERTO FOR STRING ORCHESTRA PIANO AND TIMPS OF NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT IS MAYBE HIS MOST WELL KNOWN PIECE 
SIX SYMPHONIES THAT DO GET PERFORMED JULIETTA HIS OPERA 
ALL RIGHT IT'S NOT TOSCA 
BUT HE WROTE OVER FOUR HUNDRED PIECES AND ALONG WITH VILLA LOBOS I THINK WHO WROTE OVER SIX HUNDRED 
AND MILHAUD THE FRENCH COMPOSER WRITING ALMOST THE SAME 
THESE COMPOSERS WRITING SO MUCH MUSIC I ASSUME THAT NOT ALL OF IT IS PUBLISHED 
AND IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT TO TRACK DOWN IF IT IS AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR PROMOTERS 
AND CONCERT ORGANISERS TO PUT THINGS ON ONE THING ZOE HE DOES DO 
IN COMMON WITH OTHER CZECH COMPOSERS DVORAK AND SMETANA INCLUDED IS QUOTE WIDELY 
FROM BOHEMIAN AND MORAVIAN FOLKSONG 
AND IT'S NOT JUST CZECH MUSIC THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF VOICES HE DRAWS ON A GREAT MANY INFLUENCES 
FRENCH AVANT GARDE YOU HEAR BITS OF RAVEL STRAVINSKY MORAVIAN FOLK TUNES 
BUT HIS OWN DISTINCTION IS FOR VOICE THERE'S NO ONE LIKE HIM 
IT'S A YOUNG CZECH PIANIST WHO PERFORMS THE WORK THIS EVENING 
IVO KAHANEK WITH THE B. B. C. SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA AND JIRI BELOHLAVEK 
A CZECH SOLOIST A CZECH CONDUCTOR AND CZECH MUSIC 
BOHUSLAV MARTINU'S FOURTH PIANO CONCERTO 
INCANTATION 
THE SOLOIST IVO KAHANEK WITH THE B. B. C. SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
AND ITS CHIEF CONDUCTOR JIRI BELOHLAVEK 
KAHANEK IS TWENTY EIGHT FROM OSTRAVA IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
HE TOLD US EARLIER THAT HE'S SO EXCITED TO BE HERE IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCERT OF HIS CAREER 
AND THIS HALL IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST SPACE HE'S PLAYED IN 
NOT JUST HIS PROMS DEBUT BUT HIS BRITISH DEBUT AS WELL 
HE TOLD ME EARLIER THAT THIS CONCERTO IS A VERY SPECIAL ONE FOR HIM 
THE TITLE IS INCANTATION HE SAYS HIS ROLE IS TO CONJURE SPELLS 
FOR THE AUDIENCE 
AND CREATE A SPECIAL BOND WITH THEM 
CERTAINLY A SPECIAL BOND NOW WITH THAT SECOND VIOLIN PLAYER 
WITH JIRI BELOHLAVEK THIS TIME WHO TOLD ME EARLIER 
HE REGARDS MARTINU'S MUSIC VERY HIGHLY FOR ITS CONSTANTLY FRESH SOURCE OF INSPIRATION 
HE WAS THE MOST OPEN MINDED PERSON SAYS BELOHLAVEK OPEN TO ALL INFLUENCES AROUND HIM 
AND THAT GAVE HIS MUSIC 
THAT MULTI FACETED QUALITY AS EVERYTHING HE ENCOUNTERED 
WAS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION 
SO WE'RE AT THE INTERVAL NOW 
AND FOR THE NEXT TWENTY MINUTES OR SO WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS THE VERY REASON WHY WE'RE ALL HERE 
THE B. B. C. PROMS THEMSELVES 
THIS IS THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTEENTH SEASON OF THE PROMS 
IT'S ALSO THE EIGHTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE B. B. C. TAKING CONTROL 
AND THEREFORE BECOMING RESPONSIBLE NOT JUST FOR BROADCASTING THE PROMS BUT FOR PROMOTING THEM AS WELL 
THIS IS ALSO NICHOLAS KENYON'S FINAL SEASON AS DIRECTOR OF THE PROMS BEFORE HE HEADS OFF TO PASTURES NEW 
THE NEXT SEASON WILL BE DIRECTED BY THE CONTROLLER OF B. B. C. RADIO THREE ROGER WRIGHT 
SO WHAT WILL THE NEW BOSS INHERIT HERE ARE SOME FIGURES 
THIS YEAR THERE ARE 
ALL BROADCAST ON RADIO THREE AND OVER A THIRD OF THEM BROADCAST ON T. V. 
OVER AT CADOGAN HALL THERE ARE 
THERE'LL BE FIVE ADDITIONAL LAST NIGHT PROMS IN THE PARK EVENTS 
AS WELL AS A SERIES OF FAMILY CONCERTS AND EVEN 
SO WHEN THE PROMS DESCRIBES ITSELF AS THE WORLD'S GREATEST MUSIC FESTIVAL 
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANYTHING TOPPING IT 
BUT COULD THE PROMS DO MORE WHAT IS ITS MAIN RESPONSIBILITY 
AND SHOULD IT BE DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
IF YOU RAN THE PROMS WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE 
TO START THE BALL ROLLING WITH ME HERE IN THE B. B. C. FOUR BOX 
I'M JOINED BY AN ACADEMIC AND MUSICIAN WHO TWO YEARS AGO WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THE B. B. C. 
THAT WASN'T ENTIRELY COMPLIMENTARY 
THE PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY AND MUSIC AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY 
GEORGINA BORN GEORGINA WELCOME TO THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL THANK YOU 
WHEN THE B. B. C. TOOK OVER THE PROMS IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THERE WERE SOME STRONG VOICES FROM WITHIN THE CORPORATION 
WHO WERE RESISTANT WHO FELT IT WASN'T THE JOB 
OF A BROADCASTER TO PROMOTE A CONCERT SEASON 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S CHANGED NOW 
NO I THINK THE B. B. C. SHOULD BE 
PROGRAMMING LIVE MUSIC 
IT'S VERY MUCH AN EXTENSION OF ITS ROLE NATIONALLY IN MUSIC 
AND MOREOVER COMMISSIONING AND SUPPORTING THE ORCHESTRAS AND SO ON 
HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT AND POWERFUL ELEMENT 
OF ITS CULTURAL WORK IF YOU LIKE IN BRITAIN 
THE QUESTION IS WHAT FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND HAVE THINGS MOVED ON SINCE THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
I WAS GOING TO SAY THE B. B. C. HAS MADE HUGE ADVANCES OVER ITS EIGHTY YEARS OF EXISTENCE 
MORE THAN EIGHTY YEARS IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE 
THE FACT THAT WE'RE HERE ON A RELATIVELY NEW DIGITAL CHANNEL 
AND THE PROMS ARE STREAMED ON THE INTERNET 
DO YOU THINK THE PROMS HAVEN'T KEPT UP WITH THOSE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES 
NO IT'S NOT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY IT'S ABOUT MUSIC 
IT'S ABOUT THE FACT THAT MUSICAL LIFE TODAY IS FAR MORE PLURAL THAN IT EVER WAS BEFORE 
WE HAVE A CENTURY OF THE FANTASTICALLY INTERESTING COMPLEX DEVELOPMENT 
OF NEW KINDS OF POPULAR MUSIC BROUGHT TO US THROUGH NEW TECHNOLOGIES 
MUSIC CREATED THROUGH NEW TECHNOLOGIES 
THE ELECTRIC GUITAR AND THE WONDERFUL EFFECTS THAT THAT BROUGHT TO AREAS OF JAZZ BLUES 
AND ROCK AND SO ON 
AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO I THINK THE B. B. C. HAS TO CHANGE ITS IMAGINATION 
TO PLURALISE AND BRING THESE LANGUAGES TOGETHER MORE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
WHY DOES THE ELECTRICAL GUITAR HAVE A PLACE IN WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A CLASSICAL MUSIC FESTIVAL 
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS SHOULD REMAIN A CLASSICAL MUSIC FESTIVAL 
IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY DEFINITION OF THE TERM 
AND HOW WE UNDERSTAND 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT MUSICS THAT MAKE UP OUR NATIONAL MUSICAL LIFE 
THE B. B. C. HAS A VIEW OF MUSIC THAT IT'S KIND OF ZONED 
WE HAVE RADIO ONE DOING THAT 
RADIO TWO DOING THAT RADIO THREE DOES THAT 
BUT ALL THAT BEGAN TO COLLAPSE UNDER ROGER WRIGHT ON RADIO THREE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO 
WHEN HE INTRODUCED SOME FANTASTICALLY INTERESTING LATE NIGHT ZONES 
LIKE MIXING IT AND LATE JUNCTION 
WHERE YOU GET ALL KINDS OF EXPERIMENTAL MUSIC FROM THE CLASSICAL WORLD FROM EXPERIMENTAL JAZZ 
FROM EXPERIMENTAL ROCK FROM ALL COLOURS COMING TOGETHER 
THAT MAKES A NEW KIND OF CONDITION FOR THE MUSICAL LANGUAGE AND IT'S A VERY GENERATIVE ONE 
IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE THE ONE OCCASION WHEN THE PROMS MESSAGE BOARDS GO MAD 
IS WHEN SOMETHING NON CLASSICAL COMES IN TO THE PROMS 
DOES THAT SUGGEST TO YOU THEREFORE THAT THERE'S A SORT OF COMFORT ZONE AROUND THE PROMS 
IT'S JUST BECOME A BIT TOO EASY 
IT'S A VERY TRADITIONALIST KIND OF UNDERTAKING ISN'T IT 
WITNESS THE ENDLESS DEBATES AROUND THE LAST NIGHT 
AND IT ALSO HAS A KIND OF NATIONALIST AGENDA TO IT WHICH IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME 
THE QUESTION IS WHAT KIND OF NATIONALISM 
YES I THINK THAT KIND OF TRADITIONAL VIEW OF THE PROMS 
WHICH OF COURSE SEASONED PROMMERS WILL DEFEND TO THE DEATH IS SLIGHTLY A PROBLEM 
THAT'S TO SAY WHY DO WE PAY THE B. B. C. TO DO WHAT IT DOES FOR CULTURE IN GENERAL 
AND FOR MUSIC 
WE DO IT BECAUSE ANY GREAT CULTURAL ORGANISATION IS NOT THERE JUST TO REFLECT THINGS AS THEY ARE 
CERTAINLY NOT JUST TO TELL US ABOUT THE PAST OR REINTERPRET THE PAST 
IT'S THERE TO GIVE US A FUTURE TO MAKE THINGS DIFFERENT FROM NOW ON 
WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU A BIT LATER ON AND GET SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO WHERE WE GO NEXT 
BUT LET'S NOW GO TO THE FLOOR AS IT WERE 
WHERE THERE ARE ALWAYS VERY STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN WITH THE PROMS THE ARENA ITSELF 
ZEB SOANES IS DOWN THERE ZEB 
I'M JOINED BY THREE SEASONED PROMENADERS 
THEY ARE DAVID FOULGER SIMON HANN AND EDDIE CHILVERS 
IF YOU WERE DIRECTOR OF THE PROMS WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING YOU WOULD CHANGE 
SIMON LET'S START WITH YOU WELL I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE NICHOLAS KENYON AND RICHARD HICKOX 
FOR MOVING FORWARD FROM THE REPRESSION OF THE GLOCK ERA 
BUT AS A MEMBER OF THE BRITISH MUSIC SOCIETY AT A TIME WHEN WE GOT A HISTORY OF BRITAIN WITH SIMON SCHAMA 
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO HAVE WILLIAM ALWYN SIR ARNOLD BAX MORE THOMAS ADES 
IN OTHER WORDS IS BRITAIN A LAND WITHOUT MUSIC 
OR SHALL WE TELL OUR INTERNATIONAL FRIENDS ABOUT THE UN HIDDEN GLORIES OF BRITISH MUSIC 
DAVID WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT I WOULD ACTUALLY QUITE LIKE A BIG OVERALL PLAN 
THAT WOULD COVER AS SIMON RATTLE DID IN THE LEAD UP TO THE MILLENNIUM 
CONCERTS THAT REPRESENTED EACH TEN YEARS EACH DECADE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
PERHAPS THAT COULD BE A SERIES THAT COULD RUN OVER SEVERAL PROM SEASONS 
I CAN THINK OF SO MUCH THAT ONE WOULD WANT TO INCLUDE EDDIE 
YOU MUST TELL ME LATER HOW YOU KEEP YOUR FANTASTIC WHITE SUIT CLEAN 
KEEP IT CLEAN I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE I THINK 
A FEW NIGHTS A SEASON FOR CUTTING EDGE MUSIC 
LIKE LOOP BASED ELECTRONICA IMPROVISATION THAT KIND OF THING SOME OF THE MUCH MORE MODERN STUFF 
WOULD THAT BE THE MAIN PROM AT SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY OR A LATE NIGHT PROM WELL YEAH 
A FEW LATE NIGHT PROMS WITH REALLY COOL ELECTRONIC STUFF 
OR SOME AVANT GARDE BIZARRE MODERN STUFF WOULD BE GREAT 
HERE IN THE ALBERT HALL OR EXPANDING INTO OTHER VENUES WELL 
PERHAPS A FEW OF THEM HERE IN THE ALBERT HALL 
TO BRING PEOPLE FROM THE CLASSICAL INTEREST TO ELECTRONIC MUSIC AND PEOPLE FROM ELECTRONIC TO CLASSICAL 
I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD FOR THAT CROSSOVER GENTLEMEN THANK YOU ENJOY THE SECOND HALF 
PETROC BACK TO YOU 
NO SURPRISE VARYING VIEWS FROM THE ARENA 
LET'S GET THE OPINION OF A MAN WHO KNOWS THIS HALL BACK TO FRONT 
HE'S PROMOTED THOUSANDS OF CONCERTS HERE OVER THE YEARS RAYMOND GUBBAY 
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU RAN THE PROMS 
WELL YOU'VE GOT A VERY GOOD BASE TO BUILD ON 
THE B. B. C. HAS ALWAYS BEEN INNOVATIVE AND HAS BEEN DEVELOPING IDEAS 
AND I THINK THERE IS A CERTAIN PREDICTABILITY 
ABOUT THE PROMS AUDIENCES 
AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO FEEL THAT YOU MIGHT REACH OUT EVEN FURTHER BRING MORE YOUNGSTERS IN 
THAT SHOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY TAKING IT FROM THE OTHER END 
ARE THERE AREAS WHERE YOU FEEL THE PROMS SHOULD NOT GO ANY FURTHER THAN IT DOES I'M THINKING AGAIN 
ABOUT THIS MICHAEL BALL CONCERT ABOUT THE NATION'S FAVOURITE PROM 
THAT MAYBE START TO TREAD ON YOUR TOES AS A COMMERCIAL PROMOTER 
I DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING TREADING ON MY TOES 
BUT I'M NOT SURE WHETHER IT WOULD BE RIGHT FOR THE PROMS TO DEVELOP THAT IDEA OF PERSONALITY LED EVENINGS 
YOU KNOW IT'S BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY TOMORROW LET'S HAVE FUN WITH SOME ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER AND SO ON 
BUT I WOULDN'T LIKE TO SEE THAT NECESSARILY EXTENDED ELSEWHERE I THINK THAT WOULD BE WRONG 
WHAT THE PROMS DOES DO IS BRING IN AUDIENCES FOR THE TYPE OF PROGRAMMES 
THAT YOU COULDN'T SELL OTHERWISE 
EVEN THE SUBSIDISED ORCHESTRAS WOULD HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY GETTING AN AUDIENCE 
ANYTHING LIKE THE SIZE OF THE ONE HERE TONIGHT 
FOR THIS SAME PROGRAMME 
SO THAT'S A REAL STRENGTH THAT THE PROMS HAS AND IT SHOULD BE BUILDING ON FOR THE FUTURE 
YOU'RE COMMITTED TO GREAT WORKS OF THE PAST IN THE CONCERTS YOU PROMOTE 
HOW COMMITTED SHOULD THE PROMS BE TO NEW MUSIC SHOULD IT BE A KEY PART OF THE BRIEF 
IT'S A QUESTION OF BALANCE YOU SHOULDN'T THROW OUT THE BABY WITH THE BATHWATER 
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE 
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY REPERTOIRE NEEDS TO BE REPRESENTED PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR IT 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO PUSH THE FRONTIERS INTO MUCH MORE DIFFERENT AREAS 
WHICH IS WHAT THE PROMS HAS ALWAYS DONE 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMMISSIONS OVER THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS 
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY THE AMOUNT OF NEW MUSIC THAT STARTED AT THE PROMS 
I THINK THAT'S AGAIN A GREAT STRENGTH OF THE B. B. C. 
THE B. B. C. IS IN A UNIQUE POSITION HERE IT GETS THREE POINT FIVE MILLION IN REVENUE FROM ITS LICENCE FEES 
THREE POINT FIVE BILLION YEAH 
THREE POINT FIVE BILLION A VERY SMALL PART OF IT GOES ON THE PROMS AND THE LIKES OF THIS 
BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT MONEY THAT IF IT WASN'T THERE THERE'D BE A HUGE HOLE IN THE BUSINESS 
BECAUSE YOU SEE EVERYWHERE NOW ARTS COUNCIL MONEY PUBLIC MONEY BEING PULLED BACK 
THERE'S THE OLYMPICS GOING ON 
WHAT'S GOING TO BE CUT FROM ARTS BUDGETS AND SO ON 
SO THE B. B. C. IS IN A VERY IMPORTANT POSITION AND SHOULD NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF WHAT IT HAS TO DO THERE 
RAYMOND GUBBAY THANK YOU 
LET'S GO BACK TO ZEB IN THE ARENA 
I'M DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED BY TWO HIGHLY INNOVATIVE COMPOSERS AND PERFORMERS 
IT IS THE COMPOSER GABRIEL PROKOFIEV WHO'S ALSO A CLUB D. J. 
AND THE ARTIST KNOWN AS GENIA WHO'S A VIRTUOSO PIANIST AND AN EDUCATOR AND A PROMOTER 
WELCOME TO YOU BOTH GABRIEL YOU REGULARLY PERFORM CLASSICAL MUSIC IN CLUBS 
YEAH HOW DOES THAT WORK ARE PEOPLE FREE TO MOVE AROUND TOTALLY 
I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN HEARING GOOD MUSIC IN DIFFERENT SURROUNDINGS 
AND IN MORE RELAXED AND LESS USUAL SURROUNDINGS THAN THE CONCERT HALL 
IN A CLUB PEOPLE GO TO THE BAR 
HAVE A DRINK THEY USED TO BE ABLE TO SMOKE BUT NOT ANY MORE HERE TOO 
IF THEY'RE NOT INTO THE PIECE THEY CAN EVEN WALK OUT OR GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND TALK 
SO PEOPLE FEEL MORE AT EASE AND NOT STUCK IN THEIR CHAIR OR ANYTHING 
IT'S FREEING YEAH THEY DON'T FEEL THEY HAVE TO BOW DOWN IN REVERENCE 
TO THE MUSIC OR COMPOSER AND IT FITS IN WITH THE LIFESTYLE YOU GET A DIFFERENT AUDIENCE 
I'VE DONE NIGHTS WITH AMAZING CONTEMPORARY MUSIC WITH GENIA PERFORMING 
THE ELYSIAN QUARTET AND THE AUDIENCE ARE ALL IN THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES 
WHICH IS QUITE RARE FOR CLASSICAL MUSIC 
GENIA AS GABRIEL SAID YOU'VE PERFORMED AT HIS CLUB NIGHTS 
HOW DOES IT BENEFIT AN AUDIENCE TO LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC 
IN A CLUB RATHER THAN A CONCERT HALL 
IT'S FANTASTIC 
IT'S A MUCH FRESHER ATTITUDE 
AND PEOPLE SUDDENLY HEAR CLASSICAL MUSIC 
IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LIGHT 
IT SOUNDS VERY CONTEMPORARY IN A FUNNY WAY IT BRINGS IT BACK INTO THE PRESENT TIME 
TO BE HONEST EXACTLY AND YOU REMIX CLASSICAL MUSIC TOO YEAH I MEAN THAT'S ANOTHER 
THAT'S ALMOST A MUSICAL EXPERIMENT PLAYING ON THE IDEA OF THEME AND VARIATIONS 
WHICH IS AN ANCIENT CLASSICAL FORM 
AND USING REMIX IS THE IDEA OF VARIATIONS ON A THEME WHICH WOULD BE AN ORIGINAL PIECE 
BUT USING TECHNOLOGY TO YOU KNOW MANIPULATE THE SOUNDS 
RATHER THAN JUST YOU KNOW RESCORING IT 
IF YOU WERE DIRECTOR OF THE PROMS WOULD YOU CHANGE THE VENUE FROM THE ALBERT HALL THAT'S INTERESTING 
IT'S SUCH A GREAT VENUE AND IT'S SUCH A TRADITION THAT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL YOU CAN'T MEDDLE WITH THAT 
I LOVE COMING HERE AS WELL WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THE PROMS IS 
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND YOU CAN STAND UP AND YOU CAN KIND OF RELAX 
BUT IT'S GOT THAT KIND OF WEIGHT OF HISTORY AND YOU KNOW THE RED VELVET AND EVERYTHING 
BUT STILL IT'S GOT AN INFORMAL FEELING TO IT SO I WOULDN'T DO THAT 
YOU'D LOVE US ALL TO GO TO THE PUB AFTERWARDS AND TALK ABOUT IT YES I THINK IF I RAN THE PROMS 
RATHER THAN TRY AND CHANGE THE PROMS THEMSELVES SAVE TRYING TO ADD A BIT MORE CONTEMPORARY MUSIC 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S DOING QUITE WELL AT THE MOMENT 
SORRY NO I'M SORRY GENIA YOU WORK IN MUSIC EDUCATION 
HOW WOULD YOU INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE PROMS 
I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT TO INTRODUCE LOTS OF WORKSHOPS AND MASTER CLASSES 
PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO START PLAYING INSTRUMENTS 
BECAUSE PROMS ARE SUCH A FANTASTIC EVENT AND PEOPLE GET SO EXCITED BY THE MUSIC 
AND VERY OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE I ALSO TEACH MY STUDENTS SUDDENLY IN THEIR LATE TWENTIES OR THIRTIES 
HEAR CLASSICAL MUSIC AND WANT TO GO AND START PLAYING THE PIANO 
AND I THINK PROMS CAN INTRODUCE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
LET'S HOPE ALL THOSE IDEAS ARE INCORPORATED WE'LL SEND THEM ON TO ROGER WRIGHT PETROC BACK TO YOU 
THANKS GEORGINA BORN IS BACK WITH ME RAYMOND GUBBAY IS STILL HERE 
ALL SORTS OF IDEAS THERE EXPERIMENTAL ELECTRONIC MUSIC THE CLUB IDEA 
MAKING IT MORE RELAXED LOSING THAT SENSE OF REVERENCE WHAT DO YOU THINK GEORGINA 
I'M VERY STRUCK BY WHAT GABRIEL WAS SAYING AND I'M VERY COMMITTED TO THOSE IDEAS MYSELF 
YOU CAN'T DO ALL KINDS OF MUSIC IN THE SAME VENUES AND THE ALBERT HALL HAS A CERTAIN AMBIENCE 
YOU KNOW 
WE NEED NEW KINDS OF VENUES IN PARIS THEY DO FESTIVALS ACROSS THE CITY IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF VENUES 
CHOSEN FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF MUSIC 
IT'S A GREAT WAY TO DO IT THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO ADD IS 
THE WAY MUSIC EVOLVES IS THROUGH THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN ART MUSIC AND VERNACULAR AND POPULAR MUSICS 
IT'S MAKING THOSE LANGUAGES COME TOGETHER FOR AUDIENCES AND MUSICIANS AND COMPOSERS THAT'S SO IMPORTANT 
IS THAT A PROBLEM THAT MUSIC HAS CUT ITSELF OFF IT'S THE OLD DEBATE ABOUT YOU DON'T GET MUSIC REVIEWED 
IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU GET PEOPLE WHO WRITE BOOKS TALKING ABOUT THEATRE AND FILM 
I WAS READING SOME SUNDAY MAGAZINES AND THERE WERE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MUSIC REVIEWED NEXT TO EACH OTHER 
BUT THEY'RE NEVER PERFORMED NEAR EACH OTHER 
THEY'RE DISCUSSED IN SIMILAR TERMS NOW 
WE KNOW THAT OTHER KINDS OF MUSIC THAN CLASSICAL MUSIC HAVE VALUE THEY HAVE GREAT AESTHETIC POWER 
AND LOTS OF YOUNGER GENERATIONS AS GABRIEL WAS SAYING RELATE TO THEM 
WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS WHOLE MIX OF THE GENERATIONS AND DIFFERENT MUSICS 
RAYMOND AS ROGER WRIGHT WILL KNOW WELL IF YOU START TINKERING WITH SOMETHING LIKE THE PROMS 
STRAIGHT AWAY YOU HAVE TENS HUNDREDS 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE SAYING LEAVE IT ALONE I CAN JUST IMAGINE THE RESPONSE OF PEOPLE WATCHING NOW 
SAYING WE DON'T WANT ELECTRONICA WE WANT THE GREAT SYMPHONIES PERFORMED BY THE GREAT ORCHESTRAS 
YES BUT THE PROMS HAS ALWAYS BEEN INNOVATIVE IT'S ALWAYS MOVED ON 
IF I THINK BACK FORTY FIVE YEARS WHEN I FIRST STARTED COMING HERE 
THE TYPE OF PROMS YOU HAD THEN BY COMPARISON WITH WHAT YOU HAVE NOW THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SO DIFFERENT 
SO IT HAS EVOLVED IT'S NOT STUFFY IT'S NOT AS FORMAL AS IT WAS IT'S MUCH MORE RELAXED 
AND IT'S BEEN MOVING LIKE THAT OVER THE LAST 
WELL I SAY FORTY YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WATCHING WHAT'S GOING ON HERE 
I THINK IT HAS MOVED ON BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT MOVING 
SOME OF THE IDEAS WE'VE BEEN HEARING ARE VERY INTERESTING 
YOU CAN'T BE I DON'T THINK ALL THINGS TO ALL MEN 
THE PROMS AND THE ALBERT HALL 
DO GO TOGETHER HAND IN HAND 
YOU CAN HAVE EVENTS OUTSIDE YOU'VE GOT EVENTS IN CADOGAN HALL THE PROMS IN THE PARK AND SO ON 
BUT ESSENTIALLY THE ALBERT HALL 
TO ME IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE PROMS THAT'S WHAT DEFINES IT AND WHAT GOES ON HERE GEORGINA 
THE B. B. C. IS MOVING THAT WAY WITH THE ELECTRIC PROMS 
FOR ME PROMS IN THE PARK IS POPULIST 
IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO BRING FAMILIES IN AND MAKE THINGS FRIENDLY 
I DON'T THINK THAT IS THE B. B. C.'S ENTIRE ROLE 
IT HAS TO BE CUTTING EDGE WE GIVE IT PUBLIC MONEY TO HELP TAKE RISKS 
AND EXPERIMENT AND PROMOTE INNOVATION AND I'M ABSOLUTELY WITH RAYMOND 
IT HAS TO BOTH GIVE US THE WONDERFUL REPERTOIRE IT GIVES US 
BUT ALSO HELP NEW MUSIC TO GROW AND BE HEARD 
RAYMOND YOU MISSED THE AD THIS TIME ROUND HE'S ALREADY BEEN APPOINTED 
BUT YOU APPLIED TO RUN THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE WOULD YOU LIKE A GO AT THE PROMS I DID IT TONGUE IN CHEEK 
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY ASPIRATIONS I'VE GOT MY BUS PASS NOW I'M HAPPY POTTERING ALONG DOING WHAT I DO 
I COME HERE SEVENTY TIMES A YEAR WITH ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS WHICH I ENJOY 
ALL ROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD SO I WISH ROGER WRIGHT WELL 
I HOPE HE HAS A LONG TERM RUNNING IT AND I HAVE NO ASPIRATIONS AT ALL 
GOOD WELL WE'VE COVERED SOME VERY INTERESTING GROUND RAYMOND GUBBAY GEORGINA BORN THANK YOU 
LET'S GET SOME MORE RESPONSE FROM YOU ZEB HAS SOME E. MAILS DOWN IN THE ARENA ZEB 
WE'VE BEEN INUNDATED WITH TEXTS AND E. MAILS YOU HAVEN'T BEEN SHY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THESE ARE MY FAVOURITES 
PHILIP WHITE ASKS WHY IS THE MAGNIFICENTLY RESTORED ALBERT HALL ORGAN SO UNDER USED 
COME ON ROGER WRIGHT LET'S MAKE MORE OF THE ORGAN NEXT YEAR 
ALAN CATHCART SUGGESTS THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME EVENINGS 
WHEN THE WHOLE AUDIENCE NOT JUST PROMENADERS HAVE TO QUEUE TO BUY TICKETS 
I WONDER HOW THAT WOULD GO DOWN 
ROGER MILLER SAYS I WOULD DUMP THE TRADITIONAL LAST NIGHT PROGRAMME 
AND FLY THE SIMON BOLIVAR YOUTH ORCHESTRA OVER EVERY YEAR 
I THINK LOTS OF PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH YOU 
TIMOTHY KELLY SAYS PLEASE JUST LEAVE IT AS IT IS 
THERE'S AN ANONYMOUS TEXT SAYING PROMS JUST MUSIC PLEASE NO GIMMICKS NO E. MAILS NO CHANTS 
BOB MILLER IN CHELMSFORD SAYS THE PROMS SHOULD REPRESENT A MIX OF ALL THINGS ENGLISH AND ALL THINGS NEW 
ADAM GRAY TALKS ABOUT THE LACK OF JAZZ AT THE PROMS 
HE SAYS CONSIDERING THAT RADIO THREE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A JAZZ CLASSICAL AND WORLD MUSIC STATION 
THE JAZZ PROVISION AT THE PROMS IS SOMEWHAT MINIMAL 
AND A TEXT FROM JAMES BINGHAM IN WEST YORKSHIRE SAYS 
TELEVISE ALL PROMS ON B. B. C. FOUR NO EXCUSES 
I THINK WE'D ALL AGREE WITH YOU SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH JAMES 
THANKS FOR ALL YOUR VIEWS ROGER WRIGHT I'M PUTTING THESE IN AN E. MAIL AND SENDING IT TO YOU 
PETROC BACK TO YOU 
ZEB THANK YOU VERY MUCH ZOE MARTLEW AND STEVE MARTLAND ARE BACK WITH ME AGAIN BEFORE WE MOVE ON 
LET'S GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE PROMS STEVE WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG ABOUT THE SEASON FOR YOU 
WELL I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THAT 
I THINK TWO THINGS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED THAT'S ALL 
ONE IS I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HEAR MUSIC BY A LOT MORE WOMEN COMPOSERS 
AND WE NEED TO SEE MORE WOMEN CONDUCTORS 
SECONDLY WE REALLY HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF THIS AUDIENCE 
PROMMERS CHANT WHICH IS OVERWHELMINGLY HORRIBLY WHITE 
WE LIVE IN A DIVERSE CULTURE 
PARTICULARLY IN LONDON AND WE HAVE TO REFLECT THAT IN THE AUDIENCE 
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT I THINK O. K. ZOE 
ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT SUCH ISSUES OR DO YOU THINK WE'RE BEING A BIT CARPING 
AND THE PROMS DON'T DO IT TOO BADLY THEY DO PRETTY WELL 
THIS IS A CLASSICAL MUSIC FESTIVAL AND IF WE'RE GOING TO OPEN THE BOUNDARIES A LITTLE BIT MORE 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REDEFINE WHAT THAT MEANS 
I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN THE BOUNDARIES A LITTLE BIT MORE TO INCLUDE THE REST OF WORLD CLASSICAL MUSIC 
NOT JUST THE WESTERN EUROPEAN TRADITION 
BUT I THINK WE DO A WONDERFUL JOB HERE AND I'D SIMPLY EXPAND ON WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY 
WE'VE GOT A WONDERFUL AMOUNT OF NEW MUSIC GOING ON HERE 
WELL LET'S MOVE ON TO THE FINAL WORK IN TONIGHT'S PROM LIVE HERE ON B. B. C. FOUR 
PROKOFIEV'S FIFTH SYMPHONY 
I SUPPOSE EVER SINCE BEETHOVEN FIVE 
FIFTH SYMPHONIES HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS AN ICONIC EVENT 
PROKOFIEV'S WAS A WARTIME SYMPHONY WRITTEN IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR 
DO WE GET A SENSE OF THAT WARTIME SETTING IN THE PIECE SURPRISINGLY VERY LITTLE 
HE SAID THIS WAS A SYMPHONY ABOUT THE GREATNESS OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT 
AND I WOULD SAY THAT IS VERY MUCH SOVIET SPEAK 
IT'S MUSIC WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF ROMEO AND JULIET IT'S IN YOUR FACE 
ROMANTIC RUSSIAN MUSIC THE LANGUAGE OF ROMEO AND JULIET IT FREELY BORROWS FROM CINDERELLA 
WHICH HE WROTE THE SAME YEAR AND BITS OF FILM MUSIC 
WE MUST REMEMBER THAT PROKOFIEV WAS A PROLIFIC FILM COMPOSER 
STALIN'S FAVOURITE ART FORM LUCKILY FOR HIM 
AND YOU CAN HEAR IT IN THIS PIECE 
IT'S EMOTIVE DRAMATIC AND ABOVE ALL IT SHOWS OFF HIS LYRICAL GENIUS FOR HUGE MELODIC SWEEPING LINES 
STEVE WE SAID EARLIER ON THAT ALL OF TONIGHT'S COMPOSERS WERE EITHER LIVING IN EXILE 
OR IN BRITTEN AND PROKOFIEV'S CASE JUST RETURNED FROM EXILE 
PROKOFIEV HAD BEEN BACK IN THE SOVIET UNION FOR EIGHT YEARS WHEN HE WROTE THIS SYMPHONY 
AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE REALISED THAT THERE WAS A NEED TO CONFORM AT THIS POINT IN HIS LIFE 
THE WHOLE IDEA OF EXILE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
IS QUITE FASCINATING 
ALL THE GREAT EASTERN EUROPEAN COMPOSERS AND IN FACT NOT ONLY THEY HAD TO LEAVE THEIR HOMELANDS 
SCHOENBERG DID BARTOK STRAVINSKY PROKOFIEV 
HINDEMITH 
IF YOU IMAGINE THAT NOW 
IF THAT NUMBER OF BRITISH COMPOSERS SUDDENLY HAD TO LEAVE FOR POLITICAL REASONS 
IT'S UNTHINKABLE REALLY ISN'T IT 
IT'S QUITE AN INTERESTING THOUGHT BUT PROKOFIEV HIMSELF DECIDED TO GO 
SHOSTAKOVICH SAID IT WAS LIKE CHICKEN TO THE SOUP 
HE HIMSELF WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE HOMELAND AND HE SAID HE WAS NOT A POLITICAL ANIMAL 
HE WENT THERE BECAUSE HE'D GET PAID ON TIME AND GET HIS WORKS PERFORMED 
HE WAS HOMESICK AS WELL I THINK 
I THINK CONFORMING IS THE WRONG WORD 
PEOPLE LIVED IN DANGEROUS TIMES AND WHAT IT SHOWS IS 
THAT IF A TRULY GREAT COMPOSER EVEN UNDER THE DURESS OF THAT SOVIET SYSTEM 
CAN STILL WRITE GREAT MUSIC REGARDLESS AND LITTLE DID HE KNOW 
THAT WITHIN A FEW YEARS HE'D GO FROM BEING THE DARLING 
TO BEING PERSECUTED BY THE STATE AND DIE ON THE SAME DAY AS STALIN YET HE WASN'T PERSECUTED SO MUCH 
THE SOVIET SYSTEM SUITED PROKOFIEV'S PARTICULAR STYLE 
IT WAS A VERY DIRECT FORM OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE AUDIENCE WHICH IS WHAT THE AUTHORITIES WANTED 
I FEEL HE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN WHAT HE'D WRITTEN 
REGARDLESS OF THE SYSTEM 
WELL LET'S HEAR HIS FIFTH SYMPHONY 
JIRI BELOHLAVEK MAKING HIS WAY 
ON TO THE PLATFORM TO CONDUCT THE B. B. C. SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
PROKOFIEV'S SYMPHONY NO FIVE 
PROKOFIEV'S FIFTH SYMPHONY PERFORMED BY THE B. B. C. SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
LEADER STEPHEN BRYANT 
UNDER THEIR CHIEF CONDUCTOR JIRI BELOHLAVEK 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF TONIGHT'S PROM 
FROM ALL OF US HERE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL A VERY GOOD NIGHT
