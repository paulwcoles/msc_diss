DONE THIS ON YOUR OWN

QUITE SOMETHING 
FREEZER FRIDGE A 
DISHWASHER BIGGER THAN MOST 
PEOPLE'S KITCHENS 
DO YOU SLEEP UP 
THERE WITH THE DOGS NO 
NO TORY NO TOWN THIS YEAR HE HAS QUALIFIED 
FOR THE OLYMPICS TOY TOWN WHO 
IS THE TEAM 
MAGIC STAR FROM 
BURGHLEY LAST YEAR 
THAT IS QUITE A 
MOUTHFUL WHAT DO YOU CALL HIM 
PEBBLES 
WHO IS THIS 
GLENBUCK PEBBLES GOT HIM LAST YEAR 
YOU ARE GOING TO 
BE THE FIRST TWO IN THE BRAND NEW 
HORSEBOX DO NOT KICK IT 
STEADY STEADY 
THE MAIN THING WE 
WANT TO MAKE SURE OF IS THAT THE 
WINDOW WIPERS ARE WORKING 
WHEN I GOT IN THE SEE IT WENT DOWN 
SPRING LOADED IN THE SEAT AND 
THERE IS CAMERA 
YES YOU CAN 
LIFT IT UP 
WHAT DID MICHAEL THINK 
OF THE TRACK 
HE LOVES IT HE LOVES 
THE GADGETS 
BUT IS HE ALLOWED TO 
DRIVE IT NO 
YOU NEVER TEMPTED HIM NO TO GO OUT WITH AN EVENT RIDER GOT GOT NO CAN 
YOU IMAGINE GOD NO WHEN WHEN YOU ARE GOING INTO SUCH A BIG 
COMPETITION LIKE BADMINTON NOT ON 
YOUR OLYMPIC COURSE ARE YOU OUT TO 
WIN IT HORSE 
THESE ARE VERY 
DIFFERENT HORSES L. THOUGHT I WOULD 
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ON TOY TOWN BUT 
I HOPE THESE HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
JUMP ROUND 
WHO WILL BE THE RIDERS 
AT THIS YEAR'S BADMINTON WHO ARE 
MOST LIKELY TO BE THE TOP THREE OR 
FOUR 
I DO NOT KNOW MARY HAS A FOUR GREAT CHANCE 
MARY KING 
YES WITH 
A CAVALIER HORSE SHE HAS BEEN 
DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME SHE IS 
GOOD PERSON TO HAVE AROUND 
I HAVE 
BEEN DRAWN NUMBER ONE WITH MY FIRST 
HORSE AND I THINK THAT IS THE FIRST 
TIME EVER AT BADMINTON THAT I HAVE 
BEEN NUMBER ONE IT SOUNDS AS 
THOUGH THE COURSE IS GOING TO BE 
QUITE DIFFERENT THIS YEAR AND I AM 
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A 
CRACK 
WHAT ABOUT FOR WILLIAM FOX CRACK PITT 
HE IS PROBABLY THE BEST RIDER PITT IN THE WORLD ON SO MANY DIFFERENT 
HORSES 
I HAVE SOME GOOD OLD HORSES CAMPAIGNERS AND WE HAVE TAMARILLO 
A FANTASTIC HORSE IF HE JUST 
SETTLES DOWN AND BEHAVE TOO SHOULD 
BE VERY EXCITING BEHAVES HE 
SHOULD BE VERY EXCITING 
IF SHE HAD A COMEBACK SHE COULD 
HAVE GREAT CHANCE 
YES SHE HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN CONSISTENT 
I HAVE HAD 
SOME FANTASTIC BADMINTON EVENTS AND 
SOME GUT WRENCHING ONES L. KNOW THE 
AREAS A VERY FINE MARGIN BETWEEN IT 
BEING A GREAT SUCCESS AND A HUGE 
FAILURE I KNOW IT IS 
AND IS IT 
UP TO YOU TO SAY THAT I AM PITT 
PIPPA FUNNELL AND I WANT TO GO TO 
THE OLYMPICS 
THERE IS LIFE IN THE 
OLD GIRL YET L. L. WOULD LOVE TO GO TO 
THE OLYMPICS BUT IT WAS A DIFFICULT 
ONE THERE WAS A DIFFICULT DECISION 
WHETHER TO SAVE IT FOR THE OLYMPICS 
BUT THE PLACE IS NEVER GUARANTEED 
THE CHOICE BETWEEN THAT AND 
BADMINTON ALL THE WAY ALONG IF HE 
IS IN GOOD FORM I BRING HIM HERE 
THE CHANCE IS YOU COULD MISS OUT ON 
IT HERE IF THEY FEEL WELL AND THEN 
MISS OUT ON THE GAMES AS WELL 
IN TERMS OF THE OLYMPICS HOW MUCH 
WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU TO BE THERE 
REPRESENTING GREAT BRITAIN ON THE 
BIGGEST STAGE 
IT WOULD BE GREAT 
BOTH MY PARENTS HAVE GONE IT IS 
ONE OF THOSE COMPETITIONS I DON'T 
KNOW WHY PEOPLE WANT TO BE THERE 
AND THEY WANT TO COMPETE 
THE GOOD 
THING IS THAT YOU MUST REALISE THAT 
YOU DESERVE YOUR PLACE ON THAT TEAM 
I THINK IN TERMS OF RESULTS 
EUROPEANS LAST YEAR WAS PROBABLY 
THE WORST RESULT BUT OTHERWISE HE 
IS PRETTY CONSISTENT AT 
CHAMPIONSHIP LEVEL WE HAVE ALWAYS 
SAVED HIM FOR A CHAMPIONSHIP WHEN WHEN DES MOLONEY MAKE HIS NEXT DECISION 
AFTER BADMINTON WHEN THERE'S 
YOGI MAKE HIS NEXT DECISION HOW 
IMPORTANT IS IT 
IT IS ONE OF THE 
MOST IMPORTANT OF THE WHOLE 
CALENDAR IT IS PART OF A WHOLE 
PACKAGE THE SELECTORS CHOOSE FROM 
PAST AND PRESENT FORM SOME OF THE 
HORSES HAVE HAD GREAT FORM IN THE 
PAST BUT THEY ARE NOT HERE 
NECESSARILY AND SOME OTHER HORSES 
WE HAVE FOUND IT IS TOO MUCH FOR 
THEM TO BE HERE AS WELL AS AT THE 
OLYMPICS BUT ALL THE OTHER OLYMPIC 
CANDIDATES ARE BASICALLY HERE IT 
WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY 
FARE 
IF WE GET A BRITISH WINNER FARE HERE WHICH WE HAVE NOT HAD FOR A 
FEW YEARS WITH THAT AUTOMATICALLY 
MEAN THEY WILL GO TO THE OLYMPICS 
OR DOES IT DEPEND WHO IT IS IT IT DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON WHO IT IS AND 
ON THEIR PAST FOUR YOU DO NOT JUST 
LOOK AT ONE GOOD RESULT IF IT IS A 
HORSE THAT HAS HAD PASSED GOOD 
RESULTS AND THEY ARE IN WITH A REAL 
CHANCE BUT IT IS NOT JUST 
GUARANTEED THAT IF THEY WIN HERE 
THEN THEY WILL GO TO THE OLYMPICS 
WE MADE IT HERE SAFELY THIS IS 
BADMINTON WHAT DO YOU THINK VERY 
OLD FASHIONED STABLES 
YES THAT IS 
WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL BEING IN THE 
OLD STABLES 
WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH 
THEM TOMORROW DRESSAGE IS NOT 
UNTIL 
HE HAS DRESSAGE ON FRIDAY UNTIL AND HE HAS THEM ON THURSDAY L. 
PROBABLY WILL NOT DO VERY MUCH WITH 
HIM IT JUST GETS ANNOYED 
NOW ALL 
YOU HAVE TO DO IS WIN BADMINTON 
HOPEFULLY IT WILL STOP RAINING 
VERY DIFFERENT TO LAST YEAR VERY 
DIFFERENT HORSES A VERY DIFFERENT 
COMPETITION I AM LOOKING FORWARD 
TO IT 
ZARA PHILLIPS WILL BE 
CAMPING IN COMFORT AND SO WILL HER 
HORSES ARDFIELD MAGIC STAR AND 
GLENBUCK THE PAST FEW YEARS THIS 
COMPETITION HAS BEEN WON BY 
SOMEBODY REPRESENTING AUSTRALIA 
WHAT IS THE OVERSEAS CHALLENGE 
ANDREW HOY IS LOOKING TO WIN IT FOR 
THEIR THIRD TIME IN THREE YEARS 
BUT CLAYTON FREDERICKS PLAYED THE 
SUPPORTIVE HUSBAND LAST YEAR TO 
LUCINDA FREDERICKS HIS WIFE BUT 
THIS TIME SHE IS CHEERING HIM ON 
NEW ZEALAND HAS TEN DIFFERENT 
CHANCES OF WINNING TWO OF WHICH 
REST WITH ANDREW NICHOLSON THE 
BUSIEST RIDER SO GOOD HE HAS 
NEVER WON AT BADMINTON AND FOR 
FRANCE WHO TOOK TEAM GOLD IN ATHENS 
NICOLAS TOUZAINT EUROPEAN CHAMPION 
HAS THE CHANCE OF BEING THE FIRST 
FRENCH MAN TO WIN OR EVEN BE PLACED 
HERE HERE THIS THREE DAY EVENT IS MADE UP OF 
THREE PHASES DRESSAGE CROSS 
COUNTRY AND SHOW JUMPING WILLIAM 
FOX PITT BEHIND US IS THE LAST ONE 
TO GO IN THE DRESSAGE HOW IS IT 
GOING THIS IS TAMARILLO 
HE IS ON 
THE EDGE HE IS SHOWING OFF TO 
EVERYBODY HE HAS HIS EARS PRICKED 
AND HE LOVES TO SHOW OFF BUT WITH 
WILLIAM'S LONG LEGS HE HAS TO KEEP 
IT UNDER WRAPS 
AND WHAT DOES THIS 
TEST 
WE WANT TO BE SHOWING THAT TEST THE HORSES UNDER CONTROL 
SUPPLENESS BALANCE ATHLETICISM 
IT TAKES MANY YEARS OF TRAINING TO 
GET THEM TO THIS LEVEL 
AND THEN IN 
CROSS COUNTRY THEY DO WHAT YOU TELL 
THEM TO DO 
WE HOPE SO THEY HAVE 
TO BE BRAVE BUT IT IS THE 
OBEDIENCE THAT WE HAVE TAUGHT THEM 
AT THIS PHASE 
THIS IS THE FINAL 
HALT AND THE CROWD WILTSHIRE 
BELIEVE ME THAT WAS A GOOD TEST 
THE CROWD WILTSHIRE ZARA PHILLIPS IS LESS THAN TEN POINTS OFF THE LEAD 
DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES THIS TIME 
LAST YEAR A THIRD OF THE FIELD 
PULLED OUT EITHER BEFORE THE 
DRESSAGE OR STRAIGHT AFTER IT 
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT HAPPY WITH 
THE STATE OF THE GROUND BUT THAT 
IS GREENERY THIS YEAR THE GRASS IS 
THICK AND LUSH THE RIDERS ARE 
THRILLED 
TOTALLY DIFFERENT LAST THRILLED YEAR IT WAS HARD AND ROUGH NOT 
PREPARED THIS YEAR THE TEAM HAVE 
DONE AN AMAZING JOB WE HAVE ALSO 
HAD THE RAIN L. THINK THE 
GOING IS GOING TO BE PERFECT 
THEY HAVE DONE 
A GOOD JOB AND WE ARE PLEASED ABOUT 
THAT 
EVEN THE WARM UP AREAS AND THAT EVERYTHING A LOT OF WORK HAS GONE 
INTO THAT THE RIDERS ARE GRATEFUL 
LAST YEAR WE HAD VERY DIFFICULT 
CONDITIONS AND WE HAD NOT 
APPRECIATED THE PROBLEMS WE WOULD 
BE UNDER IT WAS TRIED FOR MONTHS 
BUT THEN IT RAINED FOR THREE MONTHS 
AFTER THAT DRY 
YOU CANNOT WIN 
THE COMPETITION WITH YOUR BEST SIDE 
BUT YOU CAN LOSE IT IT IS LIKELY 
TO BE WON ON THE CROSS COUNTRY 
COURSE THE RIDERS SET OFF IN THE MAIN 
ARENA FOUR MILES AHEAD OF THEM AND 
IT IS LEFT HAND TURNS THE WHOLE WAY 
THE FIRST BIG COMPLEX IS THE QUARRY 
AND THEN WE COME TO HUNTSMAN'S 
CLOSE WHICH IS WHERE WE FIND MARY 
KING DUAL WINNER EVERY YEAR THEY 
COME THROUGH THESE TREES WHAT IS 
DIFFERENT THIS YEAR 
IT POSES MANY 
DIFFICULTIES THURSDAY IF IT IS A 
SUNNY DAY ON SATURDAY WE ARE GOING 
TO BE GOING FROM LIGHT INTO DARK 
FIRSTLY THEN WE HAVE THIS HUGE LOG 
PILE WHICH IS AS WIDE AS I AM TALL 
THERE WAS ASKED TO BE VERY BRAVE TO 
GET OVER THIS THE HORSE HAS TO 
BE VERY BRAVE THEN THREE CURVING 
STRIDES AN EXTREME THE ANGULAR 
NARROW CORNER THAT POSES A REAL 
ACCURACY QUESTION FOR THE HORSE AND 
RIDER 
THEN TO GET OUT OF THIS YOU RIDER HAVE TO JUMP THAT HORRID UPRIGHT 
GAIT 
BUT AT LEAST THIS YEAR IT IS GAIT SITUATED QUITE WAY AWAY FROM THE 
FENS THERE IS TIME TO GET THE 
HORSE IS ORGANISED AND JUMP IT VERY 
WELL HOPEFULLY HORSES OVER THIS FENCE YOU BASICALLY WANT 
A NICE CLEAN JUMP THEY HAVE BEEN 
VERY CRAFTY HERE IF YOU COME UP 
WITH TWO STRIDES I THINK YOU WILL 
BE THROWN FURTHER OUT TOWARDS THE 
HOUSE WHICH THEN MAYBE FAVOURS THE 
RIGHT HAND SIDE IF YOU DECIDE TO 
GO ON THE THREE STRIDES I THINK 
YOU WILL END UP GETTING BACK TO THE 
INSIDE NARROW BRUSH IN THE WATER 
WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY OPTIONS YOU 
REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS 
GOING TO SUIT YOUR HORSE THEN YOU 
NEED TO HAVE A TOTALLY OPEN MIND 
THEN IF WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS GOING 
TO HAPPEN DOES NOT HAPPEN YOU CAN 
STILL MAKE YOUR WAY BETWEEN THEM 
ALONG THE GALLOPING SECTION THEN 
THE MOST INTENSE PART OF THE COURSE 
HERE IS PIPPA FUNNELL 
TO ME THE 
WHOLE PART OF THIS COMPLEX IS ABOUT 
RHYTHM AND THIS IS A VERY INTENSE 
PART OF THE COURSE SO IT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT TO HAVE A GOOD RIDE 
THROUGH HERE BECAUSE OF THE 
QUESTIONS WE HAVE COMING UP L. 
DON'T WANT BE THINKING ABOUT TIME 
THROUGH THIS COMPLEX AND SPEED I 
WANT TO THINK MORE ABOUT BEING ON 
MY LINE AND GIVING THE HORSE A VERY 
GOOD JUMP THROUGH THESE ARE THREE 
FENCES 
IF YOU HAVE GOT A HORSE FENCES THAT DOES NOT LIKE DITCHES THIS IS 
THE SECTION THIS IS GOING TO STOP 
THEM CUT IT HAS TO BE CROSSED FOUR 
TIMES THEN UP AND DOWN OVER THE 
BANK WHERE ANDREW HOY IS WAITING 
THIS IS VERY STEEP AS YOU COME OVER 
THE LOGGER AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GO 
DIRECTLY TOWARDS AT CORNER THE 
CORNER I CAN'T SEE THE HORSE 
TAKING FULL LENGTH OF STRIDE HERE 
BECAUSE IF YOU STEP THE DISTANCE 
FROM THE RAIL TO THIS CORNER IT IS 
A VERY LONGER THREE STRIDES BUT I 
SEE THE HORSES DOING IT IN FOR 
STRIDES 
IF YOU SHAKE YOUR LINE A STRIDES BIT TOO CLOSE TO THE FLAG WHAT 
HAPPENS 
THIS YEAR IT IS A NEW HAPPENS FLAT A PLASTIC BAG WHICH COME 
STRAIGHT OUT AND YOU ARE KNOCKED 
STRAIGHT OFF THERE IS NO SHARP 
EDGES A PLASTIC FLAG BEFORE WE GET TO THE LAST REAL 
QUESTION AT THE VILLAGE THIS 
FENCE LOOKS SO INVITING BUT 
WILLIAM FOX PITT WHY IS THIS SET 
OFFENCES DIFFICULT IT IS REALLY 
ALL ABOUT THE LAND 
IT IS ABOUT THE 
POSITIONING OF THE FENCES IT IS A 
FENCE THAT YOU THOMAS QUITE LIKES 
BECAUSE HE CAN PLAY WITH WHERE HE 
PUTS THE FENCES THE RIDERS DON'T 
LIKE IT THE HORSES IF THEY ARE 
TIRED THESE LITTLE HILLS CAN CAUSE 
A STUMBLE AT A CRUCIAL STAGE JUST 
LOOK AT HOW ROBERT THAT IS YOU 
HAVE AN OPTION HERE YOU CAN GO 
DOWN THE GALLEY HERE OR YOU CAN GO 
YOUR WAY ACROSS THE TOP AND A BABY 
AND WILL IT IT DEPENDS HOW MUCH 
YOU HAVE LEFT IN THE TANK 
BY THIS 
STAGE IT IS ALL ABOUT TIME AND 
GETTING HOME SAFELY THREE MORE 
FENCES AND THEY ARE INTO THEIR MAIN 
ARENA FOR THE LAST 
THE FIRST RIDER IS OUT ON A CROSS 
COUNTRY COURSES THE ULTRA 
EXPERIENCED MARY KING SHE IS ABOUT 
TO SET OFF WHO BETTER TO START MARY KING 
TWICE WINNER AT TWICE THE THIRD 
ELEVEN MINUTES ELEVEN SECONDS IS THE 
OPTIMUM TIME THAT IS THE TIME WHEN 
THEY WILL INCUR NO TIME PENALTIES 
AND NICE EASY FLOWING START TO 
GET THE COMPETITORS IN THE RED HORSE IS THE DIRECT ROUTE THE BLUE ROUTE IS THE LONGER ROUTE ON JUST WANT TO POP OVER THAT LOCK 
IT IS A LONG WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM 
BEAUTIFULLY DONE LOGGER THE COMPETITORS LIKE JUMPING AT THE 
BIG LOGS ON THE WAY DOWN TO THE 
HUNTSMAN'S CLOSE THE FIRST REAL 
QUESTION SET OFF AT A NICE PACE A BIG WIDE 
SPREAD THREE STRIDES SHE IS 
LOOKING FOR AND SHE GETS THEM NOW 
OUT TO THAT GAIT IT HAS CAUSED 
PROBLEMS OVER THE YEARS BUT I 
THINK THE COURSE DESIGNER HAS BEEN 
A MORE FAIR THAN IN THE PAST THAT 
IS A GOOD START FOR MARY KING THEY 
ARE ALL HERE ALL THE FAMILY THEY 
SPLASHED THROUGH THE FAR END OF THE 
LAKE FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW THE WATER AT THE LAKE FORTY NINE 
YEARS IT HAS BEEN PART OF THE 
SPECTACLE THE CROWDS LOVED IT 
THEY WILL BE HOPING FOR AN OLD 
SPLASH ALL TOO BUT MARY WILL HOPE 
IT WILL NOT BE HER OR TWO SHE WANTS A GOOD LINE HERE WILL SHE TAKE TWO OR THREE SHE GOES FOR 
THE THREE COMES DOWN THE RIGHT HAND SIDE GOOD RECOVERY 
SENSIBLY TROTS KEEPS THE BALANCE 
AND GETS OUT THE FIRST PART OF THE 
COURSE IS OUT OF THE WAY FOR THE 
FORMER WINNER MARY KING THIS IS IT DAISY DICK MAKING A 
SMOOTH TURNOVER THAT A BIG LAGER 
THE HORSES SO EXPERIENCE LOOKING 
FOR THAT LANDING OF THE HORSE IS 
SO EXPERIENCED A FANTASTIC CROSS 
COUNTRY COURSE WASN'T SO GREAT IN 
THE DRESSAGE YESTERDAY SO IT IS 
WELL DOWN THE ORDER AT THE MOMENT THE RHETORIC IS SO MUCH QUICKER AT THE RED ROUTE ELEVEN EFFORTS FROM HERE FOR THE NEXT 
MINUTE OF RIDING THAT IS A LOT OF 
FENCES AND THEY ARE ALL BIG THIS WAS A BOUNCE LAST YEAR IN 
EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE A BIG DROP 
TYPICAL MARY SHE GETS THE STRIDES 
IN AND GIVES THE HORSE PAT ON THE 
NECK FOR CONFIDENCE 
THIS IS A VERY 
BIG FENCE WITH AN ANGLED A DITCH 
IN FRONT OF IT AND ANGLED A 
DITCH SHE IS SO BRILLIANT AT CROSS 
COUNTRY SHE KICKS AWAY AND THE 
HORSE JUST HAD TO STRETCH AT IT 
THERE IT IS A WIDE DITCH THE 
HORSE IS STILL LOOKING CONFIDENT AT 
THIS STAGE GOT HIS EARS PRICKED 
NICE BIG CLEAN A JUMP OVER THAT 
CLEAN JUMPER MARY GIVING THE REST OF THE RIDERS 
WATCHING THE CONFIDENCE OVER THAT 
SECTION OF THE COURSE 
THEY WILL BE 
ALL WATCHING HE WE ARE POLLY 
STOCKTON HERE WE HAVE SHE HAS 
AN EXPERIENCED HORSE TURNING IN 
TIGHT SHE IS NOT WASTING ANY TIME 
SHE'S GOING TO GO OUT THERE AND 
SHOW WHAT SHE CAN DO AT CROSS 
COUNTRY 
WE ARE BACK NOW WITH DAISY COUNTRY DICK SHE GOES WIDE SWANNED IN ON THE 
ANGLE AND WAS NEVER GOING TO GET 
BACK SPRING ALONG WAS NOT AS GOOD AS WE 
HAD SEEN IN THE DRESSAGE IT WILL 
NOT HELP DAISY'S CHANCE OF GETTING 
TO HONG KONG 
THE HORSE IS SO 
ENTHUSIASTIC DAISY CHOSE THE 
DECISION NOT GOING ON THE TWO 
STRIDES WHICH TOOK HER TO WIDE IT 
IS SO HARD TO CONTROL THE HORSES 
WHEN THEY ARE IN THERE DAISY IS 
PULLING THE LEFT RAIN AND CANNOT 
GET HIM ROUND THAT WILL BE SO FRUSTRATING FOR 
DAISY SHE WANTED TO PROVE TO THE 
SELECTORS WHAT SHE CAN DO AT CROSS 
COUNTRY WILLIAM FOX PITT IS ON HIS WAY 
HE HAS DONE A VERY PLEASING TEST HE CAN GET NEUROTIC IN THE DRESSAGE 
BUT THIS TIME HE REALLY DID PRODUCE 
A SUPER TEST AND I WAS THRILLED 
WITH IT HOPEFULLY HE IS IN THERE 
AND 
IN THE HUNT IT IS A VERY USEFUL HORSE TO HAVE IN RESERVE A WE NOW IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WINNER JUMPS QUITE A LONG WAY DOWN A 
CONFIDENT START FOR THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR WINNER 
WILLIAM STAYED BEAUTIFULLY BALANCED 
WITH THE HORSE HE WE HAVE POLLY 
STOCKTON COMING TO THE FARMYARD 
HERE WE HAVE JUST GOT A LITTLE BIT 
TIGHTER THESE CORNERS ARE NOT AS 
BIG AS WE NORMALLY SEE AT BADMINTON 
BUT IT IS THE START OF A VERY 
DIFFICULT COMPLEX OFFENCES DOWN 
HERE YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE A 
SMOOTH JUMP POLLY IS HOLDING UP 
THE RAILS HERE SHE LOOKS LIKE 
SHE'S GOING TO ANGLE IN GETS THE TWO STRIDES ACROSS THEIR 
BEAUTIFULLY WE WERE WORRYING THAT 
HORSES WOULD STRUGGLE OVER THAT 
RAIL 
HERE IS MARY KING COMING TO RAIL THE FINAL STAGE OF THIS COURSE SHE 
IS THROUGH SHE IS NOT GOING TO GET 
INSIDE THE TIME AFTER DRESSAGE SHE WAS ON A SCORE 
OF FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN SO THIS WILL BE AROUND 
THAT THE REST OF THE FIELD WILL BE 
DELIGHTED TO SEE EIGHT RAND IT HAS 
BEEN A STERNER TEST THAN NORMAL TWELVE SECONDS TO THAT A MARY KING HOME MARY KING HOME 
HERE IS THE STAIRCASE AND TWO 
THIRDS OF THE WAY AROUND HERE COMES THE DAISY DICK SHE IS JUST BALANCING HIM UP NOW 
TOWARDS THE STEPS HE JUST NEEDS TO 
BE LIKE A COILED SPRING THREE 
STRIDES OVER THE NARROW LOG PILE 
SO WHAT DOES MARY KING THINK NOW 
SHE HAS COMPLETED 
HE IS VERY 
GENUINE HE HAS HIS FUNNY TIMES AND 
JAMS BUT HE WANTS TO GET TO THE 
OTHER SITES THERE WERE A COUPLE OF 
PLACES HE COULD HAVE EASILY STOP TO 
BE DID NOT WANT TO DO IS BUT HE 
DID POLLY STOCKTON SHE REALLY IS ONE OF OUR BEST RIDERS AT CROSS COUNTRY GETS THE CONTROL AND THE JUMPS IN 
GETS THE EXTRA STRIDE NOW SHE HAS 
GOT THE REST OF THE COURSE WHICH 
IS JUST BIT MORE STRAIGHT FORWARD 
AHEAD OF HER 
WILLIAM FOX PITT AT 
THE LAKE IF HE DECIDES FOR THE 
THREE STRIDES THE HORSE HAD A 
LITTLE LUCK AT THE BRUSH IN THE 
MIDDLE THERE WILIAM ARE MOVING 
AWAY AND GIVING THE HORSE A CAKE 
MAKING IT A BIT OF TIME IN BETWEEN 
THE FENCES A CAKE 
DAISY PAST 
DAISY DICK COMING TO THE FINAL 
FENCE JOHN SAT NICELY IT WILL BE 
A ROUNDABOUT SHE WILL NOT BE HAPPY 
WITH TWENTY JUMPING FAULTS WILL POTTER 
OUT OF CONTENTION FOR THIS YEAR'S 
TROPHY BUT AN HOUR OUT CONTENTION 
THE CROWD ARE WAITING ZARA PHILLIPS 
THIS HORSE HAS CHANCE A BIG TEST 
FOR HIM AWAY THEY GO LITTLE 
AWKWARD BUT IT IS ALL RIGHT 
POLLY STOCKTON AT THE PENULTIMATE 
COMBINATION SHE IS GOING FOR IT 
QUICKLY SHE MIGHT MAKE IT INSIDE 
THE TIME THE COURSE IS A MINUTE 
SHORTER THIS YEAR BUT STILL 
FORTIFIED JUMPING EFFORTS 
EVERYBODY HAS THOUGHT THAT THE TIME 
MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO GET BUT 
POLLY HAS SHOWN GREATER JUDGMENT 
SHE HASN'T LOOKED TO BE TROUBLING 
THAT FAST ECONOMIC WAY AND INDEED 
THEY LOOKED TO BE COMING HOME FULL 
OF RUNNING AND SHE IS GOING TO GO 
INSIDE THE TIME SHE'S GOING TO 
STAY ON HER DRESSAGE OF FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN SHE SAID THE TARGET IN THE EARLY 
STAGES OF THE BADMINTON THREE DAY 
EVENTS SETS THE TARGET THERE WAS A FANTASTIC GROUND FOR AN 
OLD HORSE HERE IS ANOTHER 
EXPERIENCED COMBINATION JUST GOT TO BALANCE THE HORSES HERE 
WILLIAM IS SAT SO TIGHT MOVING 
AWAY FROM THE FENCES AS QUICKLY AS 
HE CAN THIS HORSE HAS GOT SO MUCH SCOPE 
AND ABILITY IT GET SO HIGH OVER 
THE FENCES IT IS A BIG CAUSE FOR 
ZARA PHILLIPS TO HOLD TOGETHER 
UP A BIG HORSE SHE GETS THE TWO 
STRIDE AND THE HORSE TEARS IN MID 
AIR SO SHE GETS THE LEFT HAND 
ELEMENT RETURNS IN MID AIR ZARA 
PHILLIPS LOOKS ON TOP FORM TODAY BALLINCOOLA AT THE CROSSING HE 
SEEMS TO BE JUDGING IT NICELY HE 
WILL NEVER MAKE THE TIME NEVER ONE 
OF THE FASTEST BUT THIS COULD BE 
LOVELY RESERVE FORCE FOR WOMEN TO 
HAVE AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN HONG 
KONG HE WAS IN SEVENTEENTH PLACE AFTER 
DRESSAGE ONLY TEN MARKS BEHIND THE 
OVERNIGHT LEADER WHERE WILLIAM 
FOX PITT JUST LOOKING A LITTLE BIT 
TIRED HE IS CLOCKING UP OH FOUR 
PENALTIES FOR EVERY SECOND A GOOD ROUND BUT JUST BEHIND POLLY 
STOCKTON HE FINISHES ON 
BALLINCOOLA AT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE HERE IS THE 
HONG KONG FARM COMPLEX HERE WE SEE 
ONCE AGAIN THAT MR. THOMAS HAS 
REALLY SET THE COMPETITION UP THE 
POTENTIAL WINNERS WILL HAVE TO BE 
THE DIRECT ROUTES THIS HORSE IS STEPPING UP FROM 
THREE START TO FOUR STAFF A REALLY 
BIG TEST THE ZARA PHILLIPS WITH WITH HIS GREAT BIG LONG STRIDE HE JUST 
GOT REALLY HIGH HE TIPTOED FORWARD 
A BIT BUT SHE SAT UP QUICKLY 
TIPPED HER FORWARD 
I HAD TO WORK 
QUITE HARD OUT THERE IT IS GREAT 
UNDERFOOT WITH SOFT PATCHES IT 
RODE TACKY ALL THE WAY BUT I 
THOUGHT IT MIGHT 
SO TIMING WILL BE 
CRUCIAL ALL DAY 
YES L. THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE L. WAS HAPPILY ON TIME ALL 
THE WAY GOT TO THE DITCH AREA AND 
WAS THEN TWENTY DOWN AND COULD NOT CLAW 
IT BACK 
THE REST OF THE RIDERS 
WILL BE INTERESTED IN THAT NOW IT 
IS GLENBUCK AND ZARA PHILLIPS GLEN 
BUT IS LOOKING QUITE WEARY 
GLENBUCK SHE IS REALLY GOING TO 
HAVE TO RIDE THIS WITH A LOT OF 
SYMPATHY SHE HAS FOUR JUMPING 
EFFORTS LEFT TO COMPLETE THE COURSE BLUE CROSS ROUND TOPS FOR THE 
AUSTRALIAN CLAYTON FREDERICKS IS 
SO FOCUSED ON THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
SUCH DIFFICULT POSITION AS A 
RIDER YOU CAN SEE THAT THE HORSE 
IS TIRED BUT HE IS STILL JUMPING 
HE REALLY WANTS TO DO IT FOR HER 
THIS IS THE POSITION THAT AS A 
RIDER YOU REALLY DREAD WHEN HORSE GET THAT TIRED SO QUICKLY REALLY WANTING TO GET HER HOME SHE 
IS PLANNING TO GUIDE HIM NOW THE 
LAST FENCE TO JUMP JUST NEEDS TO 
KEEP HOLD OF HIS HEAD 
A FOR MILE 
AND HE LOOKS LIKE HE MIGHT MAKE THE 
TIME HALF A MILE BUT FOR THE 
LAST QUARTER MILE HE HAS USED 
EVERYTHING ZARA PHILLIPS HAS 
RIDDEN WITH A LOT OF SYMPATHY TO 
GET HIM HOME A LEARNING CURVE FOR 
ZARA PHILLIPS SHE FINISHES ON FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO CLAYTON FREDERICKS THE MAN THAT 
WON THE INDIVIDUAL SILVER HE RODE 
HIS HORSE AT BURGHLEY HE WANTS TO BE POSITIVE WITH THE 
HORSE HE HAS TO WORK REALLY HARD 
MY GOODNESS CLAYTON HAS COME OFF 
HE GAVE THE WARNING SIGNS FIVE 
STRIDES OUT THE HORSE WAS REALLY 
LOOKING DOWN INTO THE DITCH 
CLAYTON IS ABSOLUTELY FINE BUT YOU 
CAN SEE HIM KICKING AND PUSHING 
THERE HORSE DROPS HIS HEAD AND SAYS 
OFF YOU GO L. DO NOT WANT TO TAKE 
THIS PENCE ON WHAT ARE HER 
THOUGHTS DOES HE MAKE YOU THINK HE 
IS TOP CLASS 
YES BECAUSE HE IS SO 
BIG AND HIS STRIDES ARE SO LONG ALL 
THE DISTANCES SEEM VERY SHORT L. 
MADE IT TO HUNTSMAN'S CLOSE VERY 
EASY BUT HE IS SO LET'S GO THAT 
WAY SO HE IS WILLING YES VERY 
WAY SO HE IS WILLING YES VERY WILLING BUT HE WILL COME OFF HE 
HAS SUCH A BIG STRIDE IT IS 
AWESOME ZARA PHILLIPS JUMPS UP FROM EIGHTEENTH TO 
FOURTH AFTER DRESSAGE POLLY STOCKTON 
HAS GONE CLEAR INSIDE THE TIME AND AND VERY HIGHLY REGARDED YOUNG RIDER 
EMILY BALDWIN AT THE QUARRY THAT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT CAN 
GIVE A HORSE A LOSS OF CONFIDENCE 
SO SHE WILL HAVE TO WORK NOW JUST JUST WHAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO HAPPEN AT 
THAT SORT OF FENCE IT JUST CAME A 
BIT TOO FAST YOU CAN SEE HOW LUCKY 
SHE WAS THE HORSE BRITAIN BACK 
INTO THE SADDLE SHE WAS LUCKY 
THERE PUSHED HER BACK INTO THE 
SADDLE EVENTING IS ONE OF THE MOST 
DANGEROUS SPORTS IN THE WORLD AND 
RECENT DEATHS HAVE BROUGHT MORE 
FOCUS TO THE SAFETY ISSUES CHRIS 
BERKELEY IS WITH ME A FORMER 
WINNER OF BADMINTON AND ON THE 
SAFETY COMMITTEE WHAT CHANGES ARE 
YOU MAKING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE 
CAN GET AWAY WITH FALLING WITHOUT A 
SERIOUS INJURY 
THE WHOLE ISSUE OF 
SAFETY HAS MANY ASPECTS TO IT AND 
TRAINING RIDERS HOW TO MEET THE 
FENCES BETTER THEIR PERFORMANCE 
HAS TO BE BETTER SO EDUCATION IS 
VERY IMPORTANT BUT SO IS TRAINING 
FOR SAFETY TRAINING RIDERS HAVE TO 
FALL MORE SAFELY WHAT WE CALL 
TIRED AND ROLL THAT IS IMPORTANT 
ALL THE RIDERS WEAR BACK PROTECTORS 
THIS COMES RIGHT ROUND THE BODY 
THOSE CAN HELP REDUCE INJURIES BUT 
THEY ARE NOT THE ANSWER 
THEY ARE 
NOT THE ANSWER THEY WERE 
ORIGINALLY INTENDED FOR RACING TO 
PREVENT JOCKEYS BEING HIT FROM 
BEHIND BY FOLLOWING HORSES THE 
BODY PROTECTOR ITSELF WILL NOT STOP 
THE RYDER BEING CRUSHED IF YOU LAND 
UNDERNEATH THE HORSE JOCKEYS USED 
A LEVEL ONE PROTECTOR WHICH IS MORE 
FLEXIBLE AND ALLOWS THEM TO TIGER 
AND ROLL MORE EASILY L. PERSONALLY 
THINK LEVEL THREE ONES ARE TO RIGID 
UNLESS THEY ARE FITTED CORRECTLY 
THE PANEL DOWN THE FRONT CAN IMPEDE 
THE ABILITY OF A RIDER TO ROLL AWAY 
FROM A HORSE 
COURSE DESIGN IS 
CRUCIAL WHAT ABOUT THE PAINS THAT 
THE FENCES CAN BE BUILT WITH SO 
THAT THE FENCE BASICALLY BREAKS 
PINS 
COURSE DESIGN IS CRITICAL PINS NOT JUST FENCES THAT WILL BREAK IF 
THE HORSE LANDS ON TOP OF IT BUT 
THE SHAPE OF THE FRONT OF THE FENCE 
THAT SHOULD TOLERATE THE HORSE 
MAKING A MISTAKE AND LEAVING A LEG 
BEHIND THAT IS IMPORTANT THE 
ISSUES OF THE HEIGHT AND WIDTH ALL 
CRITICAL THERE IS ONE WORKING 
GROUP WITHIN THE SAFETY COMMITTEE 
WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT IS TO LOOK 
AT ALL ASPECTS OF COURSE DESIGNED 
TO SEE HOW WE CAN MAKE FENCES SAFER 
WITHOUT LOSING OUR IDENTITY OF THE 
SPORT EMILY BALDWIN FORMER CHAMPION EIGHTEEN FIRST TIME RIDERS HERE THIS YEAR SAFELY OFF THAT ONE COMING UP TO THE SHOGUN HOLLOW 
THIS IS REALLY THE LAST BIG COMPLEX 
AROUND THIS SECTION OF THE COURSE 
THEY CAN OPEN UP A LITTLE BIT FOR 
THE GALLOPING STRETCH VERY SLOWLY 
THROUGH THAT GET AWAY WITH IT 
EMILY BALDWIN WILL NEED TO REFLECT 
ON THAT TO GET HOME SHE HAS GOT DOG SHARON HUNT AND TANKERS TIME 
TANKERS TOWN SHE IS HAVING TO WORK 
HARD TO GET THE DISTANCE HE IS A 
FANTASTIC CROSS COUNTRY COURSE 
HORSE TANKERS TOWN DID IT SO WELL AT THE 
INDIVIDUAL FINISHING NINTH THAT 
PUTS HER IN WITH A CHANCE FOR 
HONG KONG PLACE ESPECIALLY IF 
THINGS GO WELL THIS AFTERNOON SHE 
DID WELL IN THE DRESSAGE SIXTEENTH 
PLACE THERE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN 
THIS COMPLEX 
RIDES WELL ON FIVE STRIDES AND YOU 
CAN SEE HIM KEEPING AFLOAT MOVING 
AWAY AFTER 
THE FENCE GEORGIE DAVIES ON FACHOUDETTE AT THE HUNTSMAN'S CLOSE JUMPING IT WELL TRYING TO REDEEM THEMSELVES AFTER THE FIRST CHAMPIONSHIP NOT GOING THE WAY THEY WANTED 
TANKERS TOWN 
TOWARDS THE END OF THE COURSE THOSE WIDE TABLES ARE NOT VERY BIG 
BUT THEY ARE VERY WIDE AND ON THIS 
AWKWARD GROUND SHE WILL NOT MAKE IT INSIDE THE 
TIME JUST ONE INSIDE THE TIME SO

THE OLYMPICS SINCE WITH HIS 
WONDERFUL NEW WAR SCANDAL NEW 
HORSE CAN HELP THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT COMPLEX 
FOR THIS HORSE IT HAS AN UNUSUAL 
STYLE OF JUMPING WITH ITS HEAD IN 
THE AIR A HUGE AMOUNT OF ABILITY 
BUT IT IS TO BE LOOKING DOWN TO SEE 
WHAT IT IS DOING SHE IS REALLY 
HAVING TO MOVE TO GET THOSE TWO 
STRIDES THAT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE 
RIDING LONGER GALLOP DOWN THE HILL ON THIS 
PERFECT GOING JUST A LITTLE STICKY 
IN PLACES BUT REALLY WE CANNOT BE 
COMPLAINING WITH THE RAIN THAT WE 
HAVE HAD WHEN YOU'VE HAVE OPENED 
HORSE UP AND LET IT GALLOP LIKE SHE 
HAS YOU JUST HAVE TO SLOW THEM 
DOWN FOR THIS CORNER YOU CAN'T SEE 
IT HIDDEN BEHIND AT THE STRAW BALES 
YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH ABILITY THAT 
FORCE AS GOT HE MAKES IT ALL BUT 
VERY EASY THAT HORSE HAS GOT JEREZ BLACK CAPITAL DRUM FOR NEW ZEALAND HERE IS BLACK DRUM THIS WAS LIKE A REALLY GOOD 
COMBINATION FOR HONG KONG FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
AFTER DRESSAGE SHE WILL GET SOME 
TIME PENALTIES SO ANNABEL WHIBLEY HIS ROUND THE TIME 
FOURTH ONLY TWO HORSES HAVE GONE CLEAR 
INSIDE THE TIME ONLY TWO COURSES 
BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME BIG GUNS 
TO COME ON TESTING COURSE MRS. NICOLA WILSON ON OPERATION BOWS THIS IS SHE IS A REALLY GUTSY RIDER THIS HORSE IS NOT A THOROUGHBRED HORSE BUT THE THOROUGHBRED IS COMING OUT 
IN HIM AT THE MOMENT NICOLA WILSON 
A BIG JUMP IN CAUGHT THE FLAG BUT 
THAT WAS NOT PROBLEM 
WAITING AT 
THE START ANDREW HOY 
HE IS A VERY 
EXPERIENCED HORSE SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE 
SO IN RACING TERMS HE IS WELL PAST 
IT BUT IN EVENTING TERMS HE IS AT 
THE TOP END OF HIS CAREER HE IS 
FIT AND FEELING REALLY FRESH AND 
SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE 
COMPETITION HERE IS NICOLA WILSON COMING TO 
THE END SHE IS GOING VERY CLOSE TO THE TIME TWENTY SECONDS TO GET HOME IT IS GOING TO BE NEAR AND TUCK ALL THE WAY I'M THE 
TWO COURSES INSIDE THE TOWN'S TIMES SO FAR ONLY TWO HORSES IN THE TIME IT SO FAR 
NICOLA COULD REALLY COME INTO 
CONTENTION SHE WAS FORTY EIGHT AFTER 
DRESSAGE SHE COULD BE A LOT HIGHER TWO SECONDS OVER SHE GOES INTO FIFTH 
PLACE BUT SHE COULD BE IN A VERY 
GOOD PLACE AFTER THIS CROSS COUNTRY 
DAY MOON FLEET IS A BIG HORSE SO 
EXPERIENCED AT THE QUARRY JUST 
POPPED OVER LAST LOG LANDED ON THE 
BANK INSTEAD OF PUNISHING HIMSELF 
RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM ANOTHER OF THE EIGHTEEN FIRST TIME AS 
GETTING UNDER WAY ROSIE THOMAS 
FROM WORCESTERSHIRE WITH BARRY'S 
BEST BARRY'S BEST MOON FLEET COMING TO HUNTSMAN'S 
CLOSE INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE 
TREES JUST NEED TO BALANCE OF THE 
HORSES BUT THIS IS VERY WIDE TABLE HE HAS JUST CAUGHT A LEG ON THE 
LANDING SIDE OF THAT CORNER THAT 
WAS SO UNLUCKY 
HE IS QUITE A LONG 
WAY OFF THAT CORNER IN THE END WHEN 
HE GETS THERE JUST DOESN'T QUITE 
MAKE THE GROUND 
AND MOVING FOR THE 
THREE STRIDES HE IS A LITTLE BIT 
OFF IT AND A HORSE IS JUST 
STRETCHING THAT IS A WIDE CORNER 
IT'S A OUT GOES THE LEADER AND THE 
SECOND AFTER DRESSAGE 
OUT GO IS 
THIS COMPETITION OPENING UP PIPPA 
FUNNELL COMES NEXT IS IT HER 
WHO 
WILL BENEFIT 
IT IS LOVELY TO BE 
BACK HERE AND I 
JUST HOPE IT ALL 
GOES WELL ENSIGN IS TWO YEARS MORE 
EXPERIENCED AND I WOULD LOVE TO 
HAVE MY OTHER HORSES BACK HERE BUT 
I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN ENSIGN HE 
IS ONLY LITTLE HE CAME OUT OF 
RACING WE NEVER BOUGHT HIM TO DO 
WHAT HE HAS DONE L. HAD A VERY GOOD RUN IN FRANCE WE JOIN ROSIE THOMAS AND BARRY'S 
BEST SAFELY THROUGH THEIR GOES A 
LONG WAY PIPPA FUNNELL COMMIT TO HUNTSMAN'S CLOSE COMING IT TOO SHE HASN'T GOT IT SHE HAS COME OFF 
HE JUST MADE OUT OF THE CORNER 
THERE THREE STRIDES NOT QUITE 
GETTING THERE AND THE HORSE COULD 
NOT SEE WHERE HE WAS GOING 
WHAT A 
PITY THAT IS A DISAPPOINTING SIGHT 
WE ALL HOPED THAT PIPPA FUNNELL 
WOULD MAKE IT BACK TO HONG KONG BUT 
THAT MUST BE A QUESTION MARK NOW HERE IS THE REIGNING EUROPEAN 
CHAMPION FOR FRANCE FRANCE HAD 
NEVER WON THIS TITLE DELGADO DELIS 
ALL WITH THE VERY TALENTED NICOLAS 
TOUZAINT HIDALGO DAILIES LE GOOD START SO FAR FOR THE EUROPEAN CHAMPION 
YOU BOTH WENT AT A HUNTSMAN'S CLOSE 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
I HAVEN'T BROKEN 
MY COLLARBONE WHICH IS WHAT 
USUALLY HAVE DONE WHEN YOU WEAR 
THIS I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE DOCTOR 
AND HE SAID TO PUT IT IN A SLING IT 
I HAVE GOT PAIN THERE HE SAID TO 
DO THAT FOR THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS SO 
THAT IS JUST WHY I AM SUPPORTING MY 
ARM AT THE MOMENT 
WAS MOON FLEET 
ALL RIGHT 
HE IS O. K. HE HAS A CUT 
TO JUST BELOW THE RIGHT KNEE WHICH 
IS BEING LOOKED LOOKED AT BY THE 
VET SOMEONE WENT FLYING PAST ME 
CROSS COUNTRY COURSE AND HE GOT A 
LITTLE ANXIOUS BUT HE'S ABSOLUTELY 
FIVE 
IT WAS PROBABLY YOU 
KNOW IT FIVE WASN'T A IF HE HAD WAITED FEW 
MINUTES I COULD HAVE WALKED BACK 
WITH HIM 
WHAT HAPPENED L. JUST 
NEVER REALLY GOT GOING L. WAS 
RIDING LIKE AN IDIOT L. JUMPED AT 
THE FIRST FENCE AND I DID NOT HAVE 
THE BEST SHOT AT THAT LOST A 
SHOE THERE AND I THOUGHT STRAIGHT 
AWAY THAT MENTALLY THIS IS NOT THE 
WAY TO BE SETTING OUT ON A COURSE 
LIKE THIS L. NEVER GOT INTO THE 
RHYTHM THAT I NORMALLY GET INTO IT 
WAS A TOUGH DEFENCE ALL THE WAY 
ALONG IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE 
AND I JUST DID NOT GET THE DISTANCE 
FENCE WAS A LONG WAY 
OFF IN HINDSIGHT IF I HAD BEEN 
RIDING SENSIBLY I WOULD HAVE GONE 
WIDER AND HAD THE EXTRA STRIDE BUT 
THAT IS BADMINTON ANDREW AND I 
HAVE BOTH IN HERE BEEN HERE ON 
FANTASTIC BADMINTON IS AND IT CAN 
GO THIS WAY AS WELL 
FANTASTIC BADMINTON IS AND IT CAN GO THIS WAY AS WELL 
BARRY'S HEART BEST WELL DONE ROSIE THOMAS AT FOUR LEFT TO JUMP NICHOLAS TOUZAINT COMING TO THE 
LAKE STRIDE IS QUITE LONG ARE 
THERE SO THAT IS WHAT IT FEELS 
COMFORTABLE WITH OBVIOUSLY IT 
WORKS FOR HIM MAKING A NICE 
SWEEPING IT TURNED SO I THINK HE 
IS GOING FOR THE TWO STRIDES HE 
HAS AVOIDED THAT A DEEP WATER 
AND THAT IT DID WATER THAT WAS 
VERY WELL READ AND BECAUSE IN 
NEARLY MISSED THAT MIDDLE ELEMENT 
VERY WELL RIDDEN 
HERE IS ROSIE 
THOMAS GOING BACK INTO THE MAIN 
ARENA SHE HAS AN INSTRUCTOR AT THE 
LONDON PONY CLUB AND THEY ARE ALL 
HERE WATCHING SHE IS AN 
INSTRUCTOR AND IT IS A FAST TIME 
ROSIE HAS NOT UNDERGONE A CLEAR SHE HAS 
GONE FAST AS WELL ONLY GONE 
CLEAR THE CROWD HERE AT FENCE FOURTEEN HAD BEEN 
WAITING FOR ANDREW HOY BUT HE DID 
NOT MAKE IT THIS FAR THEN THEY 
WAITED FOR PIPPA FUNNELL AND SHE 
DID NOT MAKE IT THIS FAR IT COMES 
BECAUSE TO THEM IT REIGNING 
CHAMPION AND HE JUMPED IN VERY 
QUICK NICOLAS TOUZAINT AND 
REIGNING CHAMPION GEORGIE SPENCE THE YOUNGEST 
COMPETITOR ONE OF THE GOLD 
MEDALISTS IN THE EUROPEAN RIDERS TO 
NASTIER AND DAUGHTER ARE VERY 
HIGHLY FOR THE FUTURE TEAM LAST 
YEAR AND THOUGHT OF VERY HIGHLY FOR 
THE FUTURE NICHOLAS TO HIS SONG JUST GOT 
THROUGH ALL THOSE COMPLEX DITCHES 
NICHOLAS TO SOUND HE IS A FAST CROSS COUNTRY RIDER SO 
HE WILL NOT BE FAR OFF THE MARK 
JUST BALANCING THE HORSE HE DID 
NOT GET VERY HIGH FOUR STRIDES AND 
CLEANLY OVER THAT CORNER NOW THE 
GALLOPING PART OF THE COURSE THE 
HORSE IS VERY NEAT IN FRONT THAT 
IS WHY WE WANT THE HORSES TO BE 
CAREFUL 
DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR FIRST CAREFUL BADMINTON 
I CAN IT WAS NOT THAT BADMINTON LONG AGO IT IS VERY EXCITING AND 
DAUNTING WITH THE CROWDS WATCHING 
YOU BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO GET ON 
GEORGIE SPENCE IS A FAST CROSS 
COUNTRY RIDER THE HORSE REALLY 
HELPED HER OUT PICKED UP FOR HER NICE TO SEE THEIR GIVING HIM A PAT REWARDING HIM FOR HELPING HER THIS RIDER COULD MAKE HER WAY ON TO 
THE EDGE OF OLYMPIC SELECTION IF 
YOU CAN MAKE PERFORMANCE SHE HAD A SUPER DRESSAGE OF THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THE BIG TREE TRUNK THERE BASICALLY 
VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR THE HORSES 
COMPETING AT THIS LEVEL THAT IS 
ACTUALLY QUITE A SLOW IT DOWN NOW 
IT JUST LETS THE HORSE GET THEIR 
BREATH BACK SLOPE DOWN THERE GEORGIE SPENCE NOW AT THE H. S. B. C. 
CLASSIC TURNING CERTAINLY NOT 
FAZED THESE YOUNG RIDERS THEY 
HAVE SUPER TEMPERAMENTS THEY HAVE 
HAD A LOT OF PRACTICE AND IT IS 
BEING USED TO GOOD EFFECT THIS IS A NEW PART OF THE COURSE 
THIS YEAR L. AM SURE THAT MR. THOMAS 
WILL BE PUTTING ALL SORTS OF TRICKY 
LITTLE FENCES IN FOUR YEARS TO COME 
FOR YEARS LUCY IS CROUCHING LOW 
SHE WILL WANT A QUICK TIME TODAY 
OR ALL THE TALK OF HONG KONG IS THE 
QUICKNESS AND FOCUS OF THE RIDERS 
THIS LADY HAS PUT SO MUCH WORK INTO 
IT SHE REALLY IS HUNGRY TO GET ON 
TO THE BRITISH TEAM CAUTIOUSLY CAUTIOUSLY OVER THE FIRST TWO ELEMENTS BUT 
SAFE AND WITH CONTROL THIS IS A BRILLIANT CROSS COUNTRY COURSE HORSE HERE IS THE REIGNING EUROPEAN 
CHAMPION COMING HOME YOU WON IT 
HAS A VERY YOUNG MAN IN TWO THOUSAND THREE HE 
BARNETT AS A VERY YOUNG MAN ANTTI 
NIEMI WON AND INDIVIDUAL GOLD HE 
NEARLY WON OF AN INDIVIDUAL GOLD 
CAN HE GIVE FRANCE THEIR FIRST 
BADMINTON TITLE NEVER BEEN WON BY 
ANYONE FROM FRANCE HE HAS GOT TIME 
PENALTIES BUT A VERY GOOD DRESSAGE 
SCORE THREE HUNDRED NINETY SIX INTO THE LEAD HE GOES 
FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR THAT IS GOING TO TAKE SOME 
BEATING LUCY IS REALLY FOCUSING AND LOOKING AT WHAT SHE HAS TO DO HERE THE HORSE REALLY CAUGHT HIS KNEE 
THERE SHE SAT UP VERY QUICKLY SHE 
WILL HAVE TO TAKE THE SLOW 
ALTERNATIVE THE SECONDS ARE 
TICKING AWAY THIS WOULD NOT HAVE 
BEEN HER PLAN AS A RIDER OF YOU 
HAVE TO KNOW EVERY OPTION OF WHAT 
MIGHT HAPPEN 
SHE REALLY DID SEE IT 
VERY TIGHT SIT WILL MAKE 
ANY CHANGES TO HER ORIGINAL PLAN 
SHE WILL HAVE TO OPEN UP AND GALLOP 
ON THESE STRUCTURES MORE THAN SHE 
WOULD HAVE PLANNED BECAUSE OF THE 
TIME WASTED AT THE PREVIOUS FENCE 
BUT YOU MUST NOT LOSE THE FOCUS AND 
THE PRESENTATION OF THE HORSES IN 
FRONT OF THE FENCES NOW SHE HAS TO 
RIDE THIS FENCE AS SHE PLANNED 
TURNING HIM BACK TO RIDE HIM ON TO 
THIS CORNER 
NICOLAS TOUZAINT 
TALKING TO CLARE BALDING 
WHAT DOES THIS EVENT MEAN IN 
FRANCE 
IT IS A BIG FRANCE OBJECTIVE AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
BUT IN FRANCE THEY DO NOT HAVE 
ENOUGH GOOD ENOUGH HORSES GOOD 
ENOUGH TO COME TO BADMINTON WHAT WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU TO BE THE 
FIRST FRENCHMAN EVER PLACED HERE AT 
BADMINTON 
IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO BADMINTON HIM BUT HE DOES NOT WANT TO TALK 
ABOUT IT NOW

CROWD ARE NOT JUST FOCUSING ON THE 
JOB MARY KING ON IMPERIAL CAVALIER SHE HAS STILL GOT PLENTY OF TIME TO 
BE THE THIRD INSIDE AT THE TIME IT 
WOULD PUT HER INTO THE LEAD SHE 
HAS GOT THIS CROSSING A LITTLE BIT 
OF A RISK BUT MARY KING AND SHE 
IS OUT OF THE FRONT DOOR CAN YOU 
BELIEVE IT MORE DRAMA 
THAT IS A MAJOR SURPRISE MARY KING 
WAS SO NEARLY HOME AND HE JUST 
CAUGHT HIS FIRST FRONT LEG ON THE 
LOGS THAT IS THE END OF MARY 
KING'S BADMINTON CHALLENGE 
DAISY DICK AND HOPE STREET AT THE 
STAIRCASE AS YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM 
DAISY DICK WHO FIRST CAME INTO THE 
BRITISH TEAM IN THE EUROPEAN 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AT BLENHEIM IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
SHE HAS SERVED THEM WELL SHE WAS 
QUITE BRILLIANT AT HAVE RETAINED SHE COULD HAVE WON AN INDIVIDUAL 
MEDAL UP THE STAIRCASE A HADST 
LOOKING A SHADE TIRED PERHAPS 
LOOKING WILLIAM JUST GETTING HIM BACK HIS 
LONG LEGS WRAPPED AROUND THIS 
LITTLE HORSE GETTING HIM TO FOCUS 
ON WHAT HE IS DOING MAKING THOSE 
CORNERS THE KEYS SAID LOOK EASY WILLIAM WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHERE HE 
WOULD LIKE TO BE PULLING WIDE TO 
GET THE ANGLE THAT WAS FANTASTIC 
HE STAYED IN BALANCE AND GAVE THE 
HORSE EVERY CHANCE THAT THEY ARE 
CLEAN JUMP OVER THAT SILVER BIRCH 
RAIL TO HAVE CLEAN JUG 
HOPEFULLY THE HORSE WILL BE 
LOOKING AT THE FENCES AND NOT THE 
CAMERAS WILLIAM HAD TO WORK QUITE 
HARD TO BEAR EVEN A HORSE OF HIS 
EXPERIENCE FIFTEEN YEARS OLD JUST 
REALLY WANTING HIM TO MOVE ON AND 
NOT WASTE ANY TIME WILLIAM IS 
CROUCHING LOW UNDER THOSE BRANCHES 
FORTY ONE POINT THREE IN DRESSAGE WILLIAM AND MARY 
WERE REGARDED BY MANY TO BE 
GENEROUSLY MARKED IN THE DRESSAGE 
BUT WILLIAM IS MAKING THE MOST OF 
IT SO FAR SO GOOD 
THAT WAS VERY 
NARROW AFTER THAT BANK THE HORSE 
IS STILL REALLY FULL OF RUNNING 
MARY WE WERE STANDING RIGHT THERE 
WHAT HAPPENED 
I THINK IT WAS A 
COMBINATION OF ME GETTING A BIT 
EXCITED I KNEW WE WERE ON TIME I 
KNEW WE WOULD GO INTO THE LEAD IF 
I IF WE JUMP TO THOSE LAST 
COUPLE THE JUMPED HE WAS 
GETTING TIRED AND NEEDED MY SUPPORT 
AND THAT FIGURE THEY SHOULD BE 
BEING EXCITED AND HIM BEING TIRED 
LED TO THE ERROR HUNSTRETE AND DAISY DICK THERE ARE PLACED IN IN TWO THOUSAND SIX HOPE STREET DAISY DICK ARE STILL CLEAR 
IS THE FENCE THAT CAUSED BAT 
DRAMA FOR MARY KING SHE IS OVEREAT 
AND GALLOPING UP HILL OVER IT 
THERE IS NOW A HUGE CROWD IN THE 
ARENA SHE IS OVER THE TIME BUT A GOOD RUN

DISAPPOINTMENT FROM THAT REFUSAL ON 
SPREE ALONG BEHIND HER A GREAT 
RIDE FROM HOPE STREET US BRING 
SPRING ALONG SHE IS GOING TO BE IN 
THE TOP FIFTEEN TAMARILLO COMING DOWN THIS FINAL

SOME OF DAISY DICK'S FANS PLENTY 
OF THEM BELIEVE ME WILLIAM FOX 
PITT WITH TAMARILLO HALF A MILE 
FROM HOME CAN HE GET HIMSELF IN A 
POSITION TO WIN A SECOND BADMINTON 
TITLE ON TAMARILLO MY GOODNESS I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT 
HAS HAPPENED THAT HORSE HAS GONE 
SO WELL UP UNTIL NOW I THINK 
WILLIAM POSSIBLY DIDN'T HAVE THE 
CONCENTRATION AND THE HORSE JUST 
NIPPED OUT IT GAVE HIM AN EXCUSE 
THIS HORSE HAS SO MUCH ABILITY AND 
WILLIAM WILL BE DEVASTATED NOT 
JUST THE COMPETITION WE ARE 
LOOKING AT THE OLYMPIC 
QUALIFICATION HERE HE WAS JUST OFF 
AND WE VERY RARELY SEE WILLIAM ARE 
LOSING HIS BALANCE HE TIPPED 
FORWARD AND WAS NOT BEHIND THE 
HORSE AND JUST GAVE TAMARILLO THAT 
OPPORTUNITY TO MISBEHAVE AT A 
CRUCIAL TIME IN THE COMPETITION I I AM SO THRILLED WITH HIM HE SHOULD 
HAVE HAD A CLEAR RUN LAST YEAR BUT 
HAD AN UNFORTUNATE SLIP UP AT THE 
LAST FENCE TO GET THROUGH TO THE 
FINISH PUTS A SMILE ON EVERYBODY'S 
FACE AND HE IS A GOOD BOY AS LONG AS TAMARILLO GETS HOME 
SAVING NOW IT IS AT LEAST AN 
OLYMPIC QUALIFICATION FOR WILLIAM 
SAFELY 
THAT WILL BE SOME 
CONSOLATION BUT REALLY HE WAS HERE 
WANTING TO BE WINNING THIS 
COMPETITION WILLIAN IS AN 
INCREDIBLY COMPETITIVE MAN THE 
OLYMPIC QUALIFICATION GIVES THEM AN 
EXTRA HORSE BUT YOU CAN HEAR THAT 
THE CROWD REALLY APPRECIATES THIS 
COMBINATION WILLIAM WILL BE 
FRUSTRATED BUT A GOOD JUMP AT THE 
LAST IT JUST SHOWS IN THIS SPORT 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN 
UNTIL THE VERY END THE CROWD HAVE HAD SUCH GREAT SPORT 
RIDE TO THE VERY END 
HOW ANNOYING 
WAS THAT 
ANNOYING THAT SILLY 
EVENTS THAT I DID NOT LIKE ANYWAY

GOOD JUMPER THAT THERE SHOULD BE A 
CLEAR ROUND TODAY 
A OVER ALL HOW

WEEKS AGO BUT IT ALL STAY TOGETHER

A LOT OF SHOWJUMPING CAN HE HOLD 
IT TOGETHER NOW HIS HORSE WENT VERY WELL YESTERDAY 
OLIVER WILL NOT BE THINKING ABOUT 
HIS COLLARBONE HE IS HERE TO DO 
HIS BEST AND TRY TO TAKE THE TITLE 
AROUND TO THE NEW COMBINATION 
TOGETHER THIS HORSE HAS HAD 
SEVERAL DIFFERENT RIDERS THROUGHOUT 
HIS CAREER AN EXPERIENCED HORSE 
OLIVER WILL BE CROSS WITH HIMSELF 
BECAUSE HE DID NOT GET THE STRIDING 
RIGHT THAT WAS PROPER ERROR HE SLIGHTLY LOST HIS CONFIDENCE 
THERE AND HAD THE BACK RAIL OF THAT 
TWO DOWN 
PRETTY EXPENSIVE BELOW 
LENAMORE BELOW TANKERS TOWN JUST 
AHEAD OF OPPOSITION BUZZ THIS IS GETTING VERY EXPENSIVE NOW 
THE PRIZE MONEY IS PAID AT THIS 
STAGE 
TIME IS TIGHT 
MONEY IS STAGE BIG AT THIS STAGE HE GETS THREE 
TIME FAULTS AS WELL SIX HUNDRED FORTY SIX THAT 
WILL DROP HIM DOWN FOUR PLACES 
FIVE PLACES IN FACT FOR OLIVER 
TOWNEND AND COUP DE COEUR THE CURRENT LEADER IS CAROLINE 
POWELL YOU WILL HAVE TO SUFFER AS

TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY WHO KNOWS 
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REMAINING 
FIVE 
THE FIRST OF THOSE IS GEORGIE FIVE DAVIES SHE WENT SO WELL LAST YEAR 
AND GOT PICKED FOR AN INDIVIDUAL 
POSITION SHE GOT SOME STOCKS WHICH 
WERE FRUSTRATING BUT YESTERDAY SHE 
GAVE THE PERFORMANCE OF A LIFETIME 
STOPS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY SIX THE SAME AS OLIVER THIS COURSE IS FASCINATING NAIL 
BITING STUFF 
THERE IS EVERYTHING 
OUT THERE LITTLE VERTICALS BIG 
SQUARE ONES HER SECOND FENCE DOWN 
NOW AND SHE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED 
THIS HORSE NORMALLY JUMPS A CLEAR 
ROUND FRUSTRATING FOR GEORGIE BUT 
SHE HAS TO FOCUS AROUND THE REST OF 
THE COURSE SOME DIFFICULT LINES TO 
COME UP 
THAT CLEAR ROUND FROM 
TANKERS TOWN WILL MEAN THAT 
CAROLINE POWELL MOVES UP ANOTHER 
PLACE A GREAT COMBINATION THESE TWO A 
BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE YESTERDAY 
PUTTING THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE 
EUROPEANS BEHIND HER SHE JUST WENT 
A BIT FLAT OVER THAT LAST ONE SHE 
GIVES HIM RUB BUT SHE MANAGES TO 
DO IT 
FIFTY ONE POINT SIX SHE WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED SHE COULD HAVE BEEN 
CLOSER SIX HUNDRED SIXTEEN THE TENSION MOUNTS BACK HERE 
BECAUSE THESE RIDERS DO NOT KNOW 
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE MAIN ARENA 
UNTIL THEY HEAR THE CHEERS OVER 
THERE IS BELIEVER NICOLAS 
TOUZAINT THAT HORSE IS NOT A VERY 
KEEN TO JUMP UP LEADER THEY 
HAVE BEEN PRACTISING BUT I THINK 
THEY JUST WANT TO GET ON WITH IT 
BECAUSE IT IS A HORRIBLE FEELING THE MAN WHO WON IT WITH TAMARILLO 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR A FANTASTIC RECORD HERE 
NOW BALLINCOOLA HE WON AT BURGHLEY 
IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE NOBODY THOUGHT THAT THE 
HORSE WAS THE VERY TOP BUT THE OWNER HAS BEEN A GREAT SUPPORTER OF EVENTING AND WILLIAM IF HE CAN JUMP CLEAR HE WILL PUT 
PRESSURE ON THE THREE ABOVE HIM I I HOPE HE WILL WILLIAM IS FANTASTIC 
ALL ROUND THIS HORSE IS NOT THE 
EASIEST IN THE SHOWJUMPING PHASE 
BUT HE IS REALLY TRYING TODAY FOURTEEN 
YEARS OLD WILLIAM LOOKS AFTER HIS 
HORSES HE PLANS THE BIG EVENTS AND 
THEN GOES FOR IT WE ARE HERE AT BADMINTON THE 
BADMINTON TITLE HE WILL BE WANTING 
ANOTHER ONE 
WHEN YOU GET ONE YOU 
WANT MORE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MEANS THAT HE STILL STAYS 
AHEAD OF LENAMORE AND TANKERS TOWN 
BUT HE OPENS THE DOOR A LITTLE BIT 
FOR THE THREE ABOVE HIM 
HE HAS 
JUST GOT TO JUMP THE LAST AND HE 
HAS DONE IT 
BEAUTIFULLY OVER THE 
LAST THE GREAT STYLIST WILLIAM 
FOX PITT HE WILL STAY FOURTH BUT WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN ABOVE HIM 
HE WILL BE 
FRUSTRATED THE HORSE WAS A LITTLE 
BIT UNBALANCED WHEN HE CAME AROUND 
THE CORNER THERE L. DO HOPE HE 
DOESN'T BLAME HIMSELF OTHERWISE IT 
WAS A FANTASTIC ROUND THE HORSE 
WAS REALLY TRYING TO CLEAR THOSE 
OFFENCES OFFENCES YOU CAN SEE 
THE LOOK ON WILLIAM'S IN HERE THE FIRST OF TWO BRITISH 
AND THEN DE OVERNIGHT FRENCH LEADER 
TO COME POLLY STOCKTON AND TOM 
QUIGLEY THE HORSE WITH WHICH SHE 
FINISHED SECOND LAST YEAR HE IS 
NOT AN EASY HORSE BUT YESTERDAY 
SHE RODE ONE OF THE TWO GROUNDS 
THAT WHEN INSIDE THE TOWN WENT 
INSIDE THE TIME POLLY IS NOW SO SKILLED IN THIS 
FINAL PHASE THIS HORSE IS NOT EASY 
JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL SHE WILL 
WANT TO GIVE HIM ENOUGH TIME TO 
REALLY GET UP IN THE AIR BUT NOT 
WANT TO HURRY HIM HE JUST HAD A BAT BACK RAIL IF SHE MAKES ANOTHER MISTAKE SHE 
WILL GO BEHIND WILLIAM CAROLINE 
AND SHARON 
I'LL POLLY COMPLETELY 
MISSED HER STRIDE THERE OH 
POLLY SHE MUST PUT THAT BEHIND HER 
BUT SHE HAS JUST HAD THE BACK RAIL 
OF THAT ONE THEY HAVE TO GET THEIR 
FOCUS TOGETHER OR THEY WILL BE 
DROPPING DOWN IT IS A THOUSANDS OF 
POUNDS FOR EACH RAIL AND MANY 
PLACES BECAUSE THE SCORES ARE SO 
TIGHT JOHN STOW LAST IT IS THREE DOWN 
JUMPS FOR THE LAST TWO TIME FAULTS 
SIXTY THREE POINT SEVEN IT DROPS HER THAN SHE WAS ON 
THIRTY SIX THOUSAND AND SHE FINISHES EIGHTH WHERE 
SHE IS AT THE MOMENT IT WILL BE 
DOWN TO ELEVEN THOUSAND POLLY JUST TRYING TO BALANCE HIM 
BUT SHE GOT INTO DE SPAIN A HORSE 
PANICKED AND RAN BEHIND AND DIDN'T 
PUSH OFF AT ALL POLLY WILL BE 
GUTTED SHE'S TRYING 
POLLY I'M SO SORRY WHAT A SHAME 
I WAS A BIT SORE THIS MORNING I 
THINK I AM JUST LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN 
IN THE RING AND HAVE DONE IT BUT I 
DID NOT RUN WELL THERE VERY 
DISAPPOINTING BUT WE ARE HERE TO 
HAVE GO HAVE HAD GREAT WEEKEND DOWN TO THE FINAL TWO HERE IS A LADY WHO USED TO BE FROM 
CORNWALL NOW FROM DEVON A LOVELY 
HORSE SHAABRAK HE HAS BEEN VERY 
CONSISTENT THIS IS A DIFFICULT 
PHASE FOR HIM FOUR HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT THAT IS WHAT 
HE IS NOW ON IT HAS NOT GONE ON THE SCOREBOARD 
YET BUT I'M SURE SOMEONE HAS 
SPOTTED IT IF HE COULD ONLY PUT A 
HALF DECENT SHOW JUMPING TOGETHER 
THIS IS COMBINATION THAT COULD BE 
A HUGE ADVANTAGE TO US IN HONG KONG 
ABSOLUTELY THEY HAD A FANTASTIC 
RECORD AT CROSS COUNTRY BUT A FEW 
FRUSTRATING TIME FAULTS YESTERDAY 
HE IS INCONSISTENT IN THIS PHASE 
BUT SHE CAME OUT AT THE BEGINNING 
OF THIS SEASON IN FRANCE AT ONE OF 
THE BIG PREP EVENTS AND PUT ON A 
SUPER SHOW OF SHOW JUMPING 
AND THE 
MAN WHO HAD A HALT ALL ROUND WAS 
NICOLAS TOUZAINT WHO LEADS HERE 
A HORRIBLE ROUND DOES THE ONE DOWN SO FAR AND THEY 
HAVE NOW PUT THAT UP ON THE 
SCOREBOARD JUST THE ONE SHE HAS GOT HERSELF SO FIT SHE'S TOTALLY FOCUSED GOOD GIRL SHE IS IN SIGHT AT THE 
TIME SHE HAS JUST GOT THE ONE DOWN 
FORTY NINE POINT EIGHT IT MEANS THAT SHE WILL 
DEFINITELY STAY SECOND WHICH WILL 
BE HOW HIGHEST FINISH EVER BUT 
WHAT ABOUT NICOLAS TOUZAINT TO 
COME SHE IS NOW FIVE MARKS BEHIND 
HER FATHER ON THE RIGHT IN THE 
TRILBY HAT WELL DONE LUCY

QUITE SURPRISED HOW STICKY IT IS IN 
FRONT OF THE FENCES BUT I HAD IN 
THE BACK OF MY MIND WHAT MY DAD

NICHOLAS TOUZAINT NOW IF HE HAS 
ONE DOWN HE WINS AT HAS TWO DOWN 
HE WINS YOU WIN HE IS VERY CLOSE TO THE INDIVIDUAL 
OLYMPIC TITLE AND HIS UNCLE TEDDY 
THE TWO SAN IS RIGHT ALONGSIDE US 
TEDDY TO 
HE KNOWS HOW TO RIDE UNDER PRESSURE HE HAS TAKEN TITLES ON HORSES THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE DIFFICULT YOU JUST DON'T WANT THEIR WEIGHT 
AND BALANCE TO GO TO FORWARD AND 
COME UP THROUGH THEIR SOLDIERS 
SOLDIERS IT IS QUITE WIDE FENCE NOW THE PRESSURE IS ON HE CAN'T 
AFFORD ANOTHER THIS IS WHAT HE DID 
TO US ALL IN PUNCHESTOWN WHEN HE 
WON HIS FIRST TITLE AND HE 
MAINTAINED THAT HAVING ONE DOWN HE 
COULD NOT FAULT AFFORD ANOTHER 
AND HE PULLED ITSELF TOGETHER 
HIMSELF TOGETHER HE IS WELL UP ON

CANNOT BELIEVE IT HE HAS HAD AN 
AMAZING CAREER SO FAR FOR A YOUNG 
MAN THIS MEANS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT 
TO HIM LUCY WOULD HAVE WANTED IT 
TO BE HAD BUT NICHOLAS HAS BEATEN 
US ALL ON THE DAY L. THINK HE WILL 
GALLOP AROUND ALL EVENING 
A DEAD 
THING I SEEN IT SEEMS LIKE THIS AT 
BADMINTON BEFORE I DON'T THINK I 
HAVE SEEN SCENES LIKE THIS HE IS A 
VERY POPULAR RIDER THROUGHOUT THE 
LONG HISTORY OF THE EVENT'S THAT 
IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED THERE WE ARE 
THAT IS THE CHAMPION THE GREAT 
NICOLAS TOUZAINT WITH HIDALGO DE 
L'ISLE 
THE SCENES ARE JUST SETTLING DOWN 
THERE IS THE TEAM MANAGER HIS 
UNCLE AND HE IS CRYING HIS EYES 
OUT AND THAT I THINK IS HIS FATHER 
WITH A BASEBALL CAP ON 
YOU CAN 
JUST SEE THE EMOTION WHAT THIS 
MEANS FOR SO MANY RIDERS HE IS A 
RIDER FROM FRANCE WHO HAS COME HERE 
AND HAS WANTED THIS TITLE BUT HE 
CAN'T EVEN SPEAK YOU CAN JUST SEE 
THE EMOTION THIS BEING SO MUCH TO 
SO MANY PEOPLE JUST TO COMPETE

SURE HE CAN SPEAK BUT RUDOLPH YOU

REMEMBER HIS SUPER HORSE IS BACK 
IN THE STABLE AS HE SAID THIS IS 
A HORSE THAT NOT EVERYONE HAS 
APPRECIATED TO DO IT IS EVEN MORE 
SPECIAL

THE SHOW JUMPING BUT NICHOLAS HAS 
USED ALL OF HIS SKILL HERE TO GET 
THE BEST OUT OF THIS HORSE YOU CAN 
SEE HIM WAVING AT THE CROWD HOW 
MUCH IT MEANT TO HIM AND MAYBE IT
