BOOK A ROOM IN A FIVE STAR HOTEL AND YOU BUY YOURSELF YOUR OWN PRIVATE SPACE 
A SPACE IN WHICH YOU'RE FREE TO UNPACK THE DARKER CORNERS OF YOUR MIND 
NOT ONLY DO YOU BUY OUR SERVICES YOU ALSO BUY OUR DISCRETION 
BEING NOTHING MORE THAN A NAME AND A ROOM NUMBER CAN BE A LIBERATING EXPERIENCE 
THANK YOU THANK YOU 
WHAT YOU DO IN YOUR OWN ROOM IS YOUR OWN BUSINESS 
WE'RE NOT HERE TO PASS JUDGMENT WE'RE HERE TO FACILITATE 
A LOT OF LUGGAGE YOU'VE GOT THERE SIR
