WE'RE GOING TO MISS YOU WE REALLY ARE 
WE'VE HAD A STUPIDLY MARVELLOUS TIME LEAVE ME NOW 
HI I'M ZOE AND I HATE PEOPLE WHO LITTER 
LITTER IS BAD 
AND I HATE IT BECAUSE IT'S DISGUSTING 
AND IT CAN AFFECT THE EARTH AND ALL ITS ANIMALS 
IT WILL HURT OUR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN 
AND HURT THE ENVIRONMENT IT'S EVERYWHERE 
I HATE CHEWING GUM COS IT'S HORRIBLE AND STICKY 
AND PEOPLE STICK IT ANYWHERE THEY LIKE 
SOMETIMES PEOPLE PUT IT ON A LAMPPOST 
SO WHEN YOU GO TO HOLD IT IT GETS ON MY HANDS 
AND IT GETS STUCK TO MY SHOES 
YUCK 
WHEN I SEE LITTER ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ME ANGRY BUT SAD AS WELL 
JUST THINK OF THE WILDLIFE THAT WILL GET KILLED OFF 
THE OZONE LAYER WILL GET BIG HOLES 
AND WE WON'T BE PROTECTED FROM THE SUN 
INSTEAD OF BEING A BEAUTIFUL EARTH 
PEOPLE WILL CALL IT A DISGUSTING PLACE TO LIVE 
CIGARETTES ARE HORRIBLE 
BECAUSE THEY SPREAD POLLUTION AND THE ASH BLOWS AROUND IN THE AIR 
PEOPLE WHO THROW LITTER ARE LAZY 
AND JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR FUTURE 
I HATE JUICE CARTONS BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT EMPTY 
AND WHEN YOU STEP ON THEM IT SQUIRTS AND GOES ALL UP MY LEG 
AND IT'S HORRIBLE 
I HATE TIN CANS BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE KICK THEM AROUND 
THEY COULD GET CAUGHT IN BUSHES 
THE DOGS START CHASING THEM AND COULD CUT THEIR PAW ON IT 
THE PIGEONS COULD GET THEIR HEADS STUCK IN IT 
COS THEY'RE QUITE SHARP 
I'M ZOE THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SAY ABOUT LITTER 
YES THE WORLD WILL TURN IF YOU'RE READY OR NOT 
THESE ARE NO ORDINARY KIDS 
THEY'RE SUPERKIDS GENETICALLY DESIGNED TO BEAT ADULTS 
JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN I'VE GOT QUITE A LOT STORED UP HERE 
I'M TWENTY SIX HE'S THIRTEEN SO ACCORDING TO ME HE'S HALF AS INTELLIGENT 
YOU WANNA FIND OUT WHO WINS 
JOIN US AND SEE IF THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT
