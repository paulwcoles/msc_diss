UP THE FIRST COMMERCIAL RADIO 
STATION IN AUSTRALIA TO GIVE 
VOICE TO LABOUR POLITICS THERE 
ONCE 
AGAIN WITH 
A VIEW TO SOCIAL 
REFORM 
IT MAKES A STORY 
WORTHY OF REFORM THE BIG SCREEN 
I THINK IT IS 
BETTER THAN CHARIOTS 
BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH TO THAT 
STORY HE WAS UNDER SERVICE FROM THE 
SECRET SERVICE POLICE IN AUSTRALIA 
BECAUSE IT IS VERY STRONG IDEAS 
SUPPORTING LABOUR THE RADIO 
STATION THAT HE STARTED WAS THOUGHT 
TO BE BROADCASTING ON BEHALF OF 
MOSCOW HE WAS UNDER SECRET SERVICE 
SURVEILLANCE BECAUSE OF HIS 
VEGETARIANISM I HAVE SEEN REPORTS 
WHICH SAID THIS MAN IS A 
VEGETARIAN OPPOSED TO KILLING ANY 
LIVING THING THAT WAS UNDER 
QUESTION IN THOSE DAYS ANYONE ANYONE BEATING HIS OLYMPIC 
TIME OF
