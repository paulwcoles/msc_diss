THERE'S NAUGHTY SAM WHO'S IN ON THE TRICK AS WELL 
DAD'S A REAL PRACTICAL JOKER SO TO GET ONE OVER ON HIM WILL BE GREAT 
AND DAD STEVE WHO IS HOW SHALL WE PUT IT OUR VICTIM 
I'M THE MAIN MAN OF THE HOUSE I'M QUITE STRICT 
I THINK PROBABLY FROM MY MILITARY BACKGROUND 
THEY'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO GET ONE OVER ON ME 
BUT THEY'VE GOT TO GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR THAT 
A BIT OF A JOKER ARE YOU STEVE WELL THE JOKE'S ON YOU 
AND DAD THINKS WE'RE FILMING A REALLY RUBBISH T. V. SHOW CALLED OUR HOUSE 
HELLO WELCOME TO OUR HOUSE COME ON IN 
MORE EMBARRASSING FOR US HE THINKS WE'RE THE PRESENTERS 
BUT THAT'S JUST OUR COVER STORY 
HE KNOWS WE'RE THERE BUT HE HAS NO REAL IDEA WHAT THE REASON IS 
LOOK AT SOME OF THE RUBBISH WE'RE GETTING HIM TO SAY 
WHILST WE'RE AT HOME THIS IS NOT A POOL TABLE IT'S A RUGBY PITCH 
JAMES 
AUSTIN JASON 
SO IT'S UP TO THE KIDS JAMES AUSTIN AND JASON 
TO PLAY A TRICK ON DAD BUT CAN THEY HIDE THEIR CELEBRITY FOR TWO DAYS 
AND THOUGH DAD IS USED TO NOISY KIDS IN THE HOUSE 
WILL HE NOTICE ANYTHING STRANGE 
I KNOW IF ANYTHING IS GOING ON 
IF THEY'RE MISBEHAVING OR ANYTHING THEY'VE DONE 
SO IT'S EARLY ON A BRIGHT BRISTOL MORNING 
AND TIME TO INTRODUCE OUR KIDS TO THEIR CELEBRITY HIDER 
TO DISTRACT DAD WHILE WE SMUGGLE THE HIDER INTO THE HOUSE 
MUM'S KEEPING HIM BUSY IN THE DINING ROOM WITH A CUP OF NICE TEA 
SO THAT NO ONE WILL RECOGNISE US AND TO LOOK AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE 
WE HAVE COME UP WITH THE INGENIOUS PLAN 
OF WALKING DOWN THE STREET AS CHARACTERS FROM HARRY POTTER 
WHY DID I HAVE TO GO UNDERNEATH BE QUIET KEEP STILL 
YOU'RE RIGHT YOU DIDN'T NEED THAT BEARD 
O. K. SO NOT ACTUAL CHARACTERS 
BUT WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT GET A ROLE IN A NEW MOVIE 
JUST LOOK AT THIS ACTING MASTER CLASS' 
JOEL BE CAREFUL MUM AND DAD ARE IN THE KITCHEN LET'S GET UPSTAIRS' 
HOORAY HOORAY 
HOW ARE WE BOYS FINE GOOD YEAH 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO DO HIDE A CELEBRITY FOR TWO DAYS 
IS THE RIGHT ANSWER WHAT DO YOU WIN 
PRIZES WHAT DO YOU WIN PRIZES PRIZES 
AT THE MINUTE DAD IS DOWNSTAIRS WITH MUM 
SO WE SHOULD KEEP OUR VOICES DOWN ARE YOU READY TO MEET YOUR HIDER 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
LET'S BRING HIM IN THEN HIDER COME ON IN HERE HE IS 
WHAT ARE THEY DOING UP THERE NO IDEA 
BOYS KEEP IT DOWN 
DON'T LOOK AT THE CAMERA WITH THAT CHEEKY SMIRK YOU'LL GIVE IT AWAY 
THEY'RE GOING CRAZY FOR ENGLAND RUGBY SENSATION MATT STEVENS 
AFTER COMING OUT AS RUNNER UP ON THE X. FACTOR 
TO THAT WOMAN WHO USED TO GO OUT WITH PHIL MITCHELL IN EASTENDERS 
HE'S IN NO MOOD TO BE A LOSER AGAIN 
I THINK MY BIGGEST WEAKNESS IS MY SIZE 
I'M A BIG GUY WITH PERFECTLY TONED MUSCLES 
AND IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FIT INTO THOSE SMALLER SPACES 
DOES HE HAVE ANY SPECIAL TECHNIQUES TO MAKE THE JOB ANY EASIER 
MY SPECIALIST HIDING MOVE IS THE CROUCHING BADGER 
ONLY ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE IN THE WORLD CAN PULL IT OFF 
I'M HOPING TODAY THAT I'M GONNA BE THE FIFTH 
THE CROUCHING BADGER HE'S TALKING THE TALK BUT CAN HE WALK THE WALK 
I'VE HEARD THAT DAD IS A SHARP CHARACTER AND HE'S A BIG RUGBY FAN 
SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY TO GET THINGS PAST HIM 
I'M HOPING THE KIDS AND I CAN PUT IN A PERFORMANCE 
SO MATT IS HOPEFUL BUT DOES MUM THINK THEY CAN PULL IT OFF 
ARE THERE ANY WEAK LINKS OUR CHANCES OF SUCCESS ARE ABOUT FIFTY TO FIFTY 
STEVE IS PRETTY SHARP 
HE TENDS TO SENSE WHEN THINGS ARE GOING ON 
JAMES IS VERY GOOD BUT AUSTIN COULD WELL LET THE SIDE DOWN 
WE DON'T THINK HE WILL WILL YOU AUSTIN AUSTIN 
ON SECOND THOUGHTS 
HOLD YOUR HORSES IT'S TIME FOR CHALLENGE ONE 
DAD HAS SETTLED DOWN TO WATCH SOME RUGBY HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LIVING ROOM 
JAMES YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT 
YOU NEED TO GO INTO THE LIVING ROOM AND DISTRACT DAD GO FOR IT MATE 
ALL RIGHT WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOTHING REALLY 
LET'S HOPE HE'S UP TO THE JOB 
THIS IS CHALLENGE NUMBER ONE YOU MAY HAVE WATCHED MATT ON X. FACTOR 
WE'LL COMBINE SINGING WITH HIS LOVE OF EGGS 
BECAUSE I RECKON THAT EGGS LOOK LIKE MINI RUGBY BALLS 
THEREFORE WE'VE CALLED IT EGGS FACTOR 
EGGS FACTOR A BRILLIANTLY CLEVER TITLE IF EVER I HEARD ONE 
JASON IN THE UPSTAIRS BEDROOM WILL THROW EGGS DOWN TO MUM 
WHO MUST CATCH THEM AND THEN FLING THEM TO MATT 
MATT HAS TO KICK THEM OVER THE FENCE TO AUSTIN WITH THE NET 
THEY NEED TO HAVE TEN EGGS IN THAT NET IN THREE MINUTES' 
IF THEY DO THEY WIN THESE BALLS 
BOOMERANGS AND INFLATABLE CHAIR TYPE THINGS 
TO MAKE KICKING HARDER WE'VE PUT MATT IN RIDICULOUSLY HIGH TROUSERS 
YES TODAY MATT STEVENS IS SIMON COWELL 
GO 
AW YOU MISSED 
O. K. SO THERE IS A LITTLE TWIST SOME OF THE EGGS ARE HARD BOILED 
AND THE OTHERS ARE A LITTLE LESS BOILED 
DON'T FORGET JAMES IS MAKING SMALL TALK WITH DAD 
TO KEEP HIM OUT OF THE GARDEN 
WHY ARE YOU ALL SO SUDDENLY INTERESTED IN MY WORK 
DAD'S STARTING TO GET SUSPICIOUS AND THE PRESSURE IS 
MOUNTING UP ON JAMES TO KEEP HIM IN THE ROOM 
AND AFTER SEVERAL INSTANCES OF EGG ON PEOPLE'S FACES 
AUSTIN FINALLY CATCHES HIS FIRST ONE BUT TIME IS RUNNING OUT 
ARE YOU BORED YES DO YOU WANT TO PLAY RUGBY IN THE GARDEN 
I CAN'T BE BOTHERED I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE BORED I AM 
DON'T LET DAD OUTSIDE OR THE GAME IS UP BEFORE ANY PRIZES ARE WON 
CATCH CATCH 
HOW ARE YOU DOING AUSTIN TWO YOU GOT WHAT TWO 
KEEP GOING KEEP GOING 
WATCH THE CAMERA STEVENS 
THEY STILL HAVE EIGHT MORE EGGS TO GET AND ONLY ONE MINUTE THIRTY TO GO 
WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN THAT BACK GARDEN NOTHING 
PROBABLY A WATER FIGHT THEY'RE MAKING ENOUGH ROW 
SO YOU KNOW WHAT THE NEIGHBOURS ARE LIKE THEY'LL START COMPLAINING 
THEY DO THE SAME TO US I'M GONNA GO AND 
NO STAY HERE AND TALK 
HOLD ON IN THERE JAMES NOT LONG LEFT NOW 
WELL DONE YOU WERE BRILLIANT 
SHALL WE SEE IF YOU HAVE GOT TEN EGGS TO WIN THE PRIZES 
NICE ONE WELL DONE LADS BUT DAD IS GETTING RESTLESS 
JAMES TURNS THE T. V. UP TO BLOCK THE NOISE 
BUT THE BOYS STILL HAVE TO TIDY UP THE MESS THEY'VE MADE 
AND THEY'VE GOT TO HIDE MATT AND THEY'VE GOTTA DO IT NOW 
REMEMBER DAD IS IN THE NEXT ROOM AND COULD COME OUT AT ANY MOMENT 
QUICK BOYS QUICK YES 
THEY'VE PUT AN ENGLAND RUGBY STAR IN THE TOILET 
DID YOU SEE THAT YES THE KIDS HAVE LOCKED HIM IN BUT FROM THE OUTSIDE 
AUSTIN MUM SAID WE COULDN'T TRUST YOU 
IF IT IS LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE 
DAD CAN GET IN BUT MATT CAN'T GET OUT 
MATT HAS HIS FIRST HIDING PLACE THE LUXURY OF THE DOWNSTAIRS TOILET 
LET'S HOPE JOHN WASN'T IN THERE AND THAT DAD DOESN'T NEED IT 
I'M JUST GONNA GO TO THE TOILET NO 
AND WE'LL GO AND PLAY RUGBY OUT IN THE GARDEN 
SORRY 
UNBELIEVABLE HOW CLOSE WAS THAT 
AS DAD HEADS TO THE UPSTAIRS LOO WE GET HIS MATE IAN 
WHO HE USUALLY HAS BREAKFAST WITH TO CALL AND TAKE HIM OUT FOR US 
HELLO HELLO STEVE IT'S IAN 
HELLO IAN I'M JUST GONNA HAVE A BIT OF BREAKFAST FANCY COMING DOWN 
YEAH I CAN'T SEE WHY NOT ALL RIGHT FIVE MINUTES 
O. K. THEN BYE 
SAM JUST POPPING OUT FOR BREAKFAST ALL RIGHT 
WITH DAD OUT OF THE PICTURE THE BOY'S RETRIEVE MATT FROM THE TOILET 
YOUR DAD'S MATE IAN HAS BRIBED HIM INTO A FRY UP 
WHICH MEANS HE'LL BE AWAY FOR ABOUT FIFTY MINUTES 
THAT'S GOOD FOR THE NEXT CHALLENGE 
IF HE DOES COME BACK UNEXPECTEDLY MUM'S KEEPING COVER BY THE DOOR 
FOR YOUR NEXT CHALLENGE IF YOU COMPLETE IT 
YOU WIN THESE AMAZING PRIZES 
A SET OF RADIO CONTROLLED PLANES WHICH DO COOL PLANE TYPE THINGS 
WICKED 
NOW BIG LAD OVER HERE HAS BEEN RECOVERING FROM INJURY BLESS HIM 
HE IS FULLY FIT NOW BUT HIS PROBLEM IS 
IF WE RETURN HIM IN BAD CONDITION TO HIS TEAM THEY WON'T BE HAPPY 
SO WE HAVE GOT TO WRAP HIM UP IN COTTON WOOL TO PROTECT HIM 
COS THERE'S LOTS OF INTENSIVE HIDING COMING UP 
SO LET'S PLAY COTTONING ON 
SO THE KIDS HAVE TO WRAP MATT IN ALL THE COTTON WOOL 
RIDICULOUS HE'LL LOOK LIKE A SHEEP EXACTLY 
I'M TOO SCARED TO SAY IT TO HIS FACE THOUGH 
SO THEY HAVE TO TURN HIM INTO A SHEEP 
CLEAN UP HIDE HIM AND ALL IN FOUR MINUTES' 
NICE ONE NICE ONE 
I KNOW YOUR DAD'S HAVING A FRY UP BUT COULD COME BACK AT ANY MINUTE 
IAN'S DOING A GREAT JOB OF KEEPING DAD BUSY DOWN THE LOCAL CAFE 
BUT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH HE CAN DO WITHOUT DAD GETTING SUSPICIOUS' 
COME ON ACTION STATIONS LET'S GET MOVING 
WE'LL DO IT AGAIN MEANWHILE DAD HAS FILLED HIS BELLY 
AND HE'S ON HIS WAY BACK SEE YOU LATER CHEERS 
LUCKILY IAN KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON 
AND GETS ON THE OLD DOG AND BONE TO MUM TO WARN HER 
WHAT'S A DOG AND BONE IT'S A PHONE YOU WALLY

DAD'S BACK IN ONE MINUTE GET CLEARED UP NOW 
BUT THEY CAN'T HIDE HIM YET HE'S NOT READY 
DOES HE LOOK LIKE A SHEEP YEAH HE LOOKS LUDICROUS 
FIRST TASK ACCOMPLISHED CLEAN UP COME ON 
DAD IS GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER AS TIME RUNS OUT 
I LIKE TO LISTEN TO MILITARY MUSIC WHEN I DRIVE 
WHEN I SAY MILITARY MAINLY BRITISH WAR MOVIE THEMES 
THE BOYS LOOK FOR A GOOD PLACE TO HIDE MATT 
IF DAD REALISES THERE'S SOMETHING AMISS AT THIS EARLY STAGE 
THE GAME IS UP AND LOADS OF POTENTIAL PRIZES ARE LOST 
IN OUR HOUSE WE DON'T HAVE MANY RULES 
RUDENESS AND TIDINESS ARE ABOUT THE ONLY RULES THAT WE HAVE 
TIDINESS DID YOU GET THAT BOYS 
CLEAN UP THE MESS HE'S ONLY ROUND THE CORNER 
DAD IS VERY CLOSE 
AND COTTON WOOL IS HARD TO GET OUT OF THE CARPET 
COME ON YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME COME ON
