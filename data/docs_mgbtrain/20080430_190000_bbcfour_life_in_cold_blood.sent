FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS BEFORE BIRDS EVOLVED 
AND LONG BEFORE THE RISE OF THE MAMMALS 
COLD BLOODED ANIMALS RULED THE WORLD 
IN SOME PLACES THEY STILL DO 
SOME OF THESE REPTILES WITNESSED THE DINOSAURS COME AND GO 
YET IN ALL THAT TIME THEY THEMSELVES REMAINED VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED 
AMONG THEM WERE SOME OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE REPTILES ALIVE TODAY 
THEY TOOK THAT MOST CHARACTERISTIC OF REPTILIAN FEATURES THE SCALE 
TO EXTREMES THEY TURNED IT INTO ARMOUR 
THAT INCREASED THEIR WEIGHT BUT NEVERTHELESS SOME CAN STILL MOVE WITH EXTRAORDINARY SPEED 
AND ALTHOUGH THEY MAY APPEAR COLD AND IMPASSIVE 
THEY CAN NONETHELESS BE PASSIONATE 
AND EVEN AFFECTIONATE 
AMONG THEM ARE THE BIGGEST OF ALL REPTILES ALIVE TODAY 
THEY'RE THE CROCODILES THE TURTLES AND THE TORTOISES 
THIS IS A GIANT GALAPAGOS TORTOISE AND IT'S CLIMBED ALL THE WAY UP 
THE FLANK OF THIS GREAT VOLCANO 
AND IS HERE WANDERING AROUND THE RIM OF THE CRATER 
BUT WHY SHOULD IT COME TO SUCH A BLEAK AND INHOSPITABLE PLACE 
TORTOISES BEING REPTILES 
CAN'T GENERATE THEIR OWN BODY HEAT INTERNALLY AS WE DO 
INSTEAD THEY MUST GET IT FROM THEIR SURROUNDINGS 
AND THESE PARTICULAR ONES HAVE COME UP HERE TO WARM THEMSELVES 
ON THE HOT VOLCANIC ROCKS AMONG THE JETS OF STEAM AND SULPHUROUS GAS 
THEY LIVE LONGER THAN ANY OTHER ANIMAL ON EARTH 
WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS 
THEY WEIGH UP TO A QUARTER OF A TONNE AND HAVE SHELLS OVER A METRE ACROSS 
THEY REALLY ARE GIANTS 
HAVING YOUR BODY ENCASED IN SHELL OBVIOUSLY BRINGS PROBLEMS 
ONE OF THEM IS HOW DO YOU MATE 
MAKING LOVE IN A SUIT OF ARMOUR IS NOT EASY 
BUT THE MALES HAVE A VERY INGENIOUS SOLUTION 
THE UNDERSIDE OF THEIR SHELL IS CONCAVE 
SO IT FITS NEATLY OVER THE DOMED TOP OF THE SHELL OF THE FEMALE 
WHO IS SOMEWHAT SMALLER 
THAT DOESN'T MAKE CLAMBERING ON TOP OF HER ANY EASIER INITIALLY 
BUT ONCE THE MALE IS UP THERE 
IT WILL REDUCE HIS CHANCE OF SLIPPING OFF 
THE TWO SHELLS FIT TOGETHER AS NEATLY AS TWO SPOONS 
SO MATING CAN BEGIN 
AND ONCE STARTED IT CAN GO ON FOR A LONG TIME 
THE TORTOISE'S SHELL IS SO FAMILIAR TO US 
IT'S EASY TO FORGET WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY CONSTRUCTION IT IS 
BUT HOW DID IT ORIGINATE 
NEARLY ALL REPTILES ARE COVERED IN SCALES 
AND SO WERE THE TORTOISES' ANCESTORS 
BUT THEN AS THEY EVOLVED A RADICAL CHANGE TOOK PLACE 
THE RIBS EXPANDED OUTWARDS 
SO THAT THEY ENCLOSED THE HIP AND THE SHOULDER JOINTS 
THEY ENLARGED AND FUSED WITH OTHER BONES BENEATH THE SKIN 
THEY WIDENED AND EVENTUALLY THEY JOINED TOGETHER TO FORM A BONY BOX 
ABOVE THE SCALES IN THE SKIN ENLARGED 
TO FORM A CONTINUOUS SHIELD OF HORN ON THE SURFACE OF THE BOX 
AND THE BASIC ARMOUR WAS COMPLETE 
BY DEVELOPING A SHELL TORTOISES INEVITABLY SACRIFICED SPEED 
SO THEY CAN'T SPRINT OFF AND TAKE SHELTER IN A CRACK 
WHEN DANGER THREATENS BUT WITH A SHELL LIKE THAT 
THEY SELDOM NEED TO 
SOME HAVE ADDED DELUXE FEATURES TO THE BASIC MODEL 
THIS IS AN EASTERN BOX TURTLE 
IN NORTH AMERICA WHERE IT LIVES 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF WOULD BE PREDATORS 
RACOONS AMONG THEM 
AND THEY HAVE VERY NIMBLE PAWS 
BUT THESE TURTLES DON'T HAVE TO WORRY 
BECAUSE THEIR SHELL HAS A SPECIAL SAFETY FEATURE 
IT HAS A DRAWBRIDGE AND WHEN DANGER THREATENS 
THE BOX TURTLE JUST RETREATS INTO ITS SHELL AND PULLS IT UP 
THE DRAWBRIDGE FITS SO TIGHTLY 
THERE IS NO CRACK FOR THE RACOON TO GET ITS TEETH INTO 
AFTER A WHILE MOST RACOONS GIVE UP 
OF COURSE WHEN YOUR HEAD IS INSIDE YOUR SHELL 
YOU CAN'T SEE WHETHER YOUR ATTACKER HAS GONE OR NOT 
SO IT'S BEST TO CHECK BEFORE YOU EMERGE FULLY 
A SHELL IS AN EXCELLENT DEFENCE AGAINST PREDATORS 
BUT THERE ARE OTHER DANGERS AGAINST WHICH IT PROVIDES NO PROTECTION WHATEVER 
IT'S MIDSUMMER IT'S NEARLY MIDDAY AND IT'S VERY VERY HOT 
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE I'M SWEATING 
SWEATING IS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO HEAT THAT ONLY MAMMALS CAN DO 
NO REPTILE LIKE THIS GOPHER TORTOISE HAS GOT SWEAT GLANDS 
BUT INSTEAD IT'S GOT ANOTHER WAY OF KEEPING ITSELF COOL 
MOST REPTILES HEAD FOR THE SHADE WHEN IT GETS TOO HOT 
TO SEE WHERE THIS GOPHER TORTOISE IS HEADING HERE IN FLORIDA 
I'M GOING TO USE THIS 
A REMOTELY CONTROLLED MINI CAMERA ON WHEELS WITH ITS OWN LIGHTS 
IT CAN GO PRETTY WELL ANYWHERE 
THE GOPHER TORTOISE IS HEADING FOR HOME 
AND WITH LUCK I'LL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW IT THE TORTOISE 
AS IT GOES DOWN INTO ITS BURROW 
AND THAT CAMERA HAS ALSO GOT A THERMOMETER MOUNTED ON IT 
AND ALREADY I CAN SEE THE TEMPERATURE IS BEGINNING TO DROP 
THE FURTHER DOWN THE BURROW WE GO THE COOLER IT GETS 
NOW WHERE'S THE TORTOISE 
THERE IT IS 
WE'RE RIGHT BEHIND 
WE'RE NOW A COUPLE OF METRES IN 
BUT THE BURROW COULD GO ON FOR SOME FIFTY FEET SEVENTEEN METRES 
AND IT'S ALL BEEN BUILT BY THIS TORTOISE 
WELL THAT IS NOT A TORTOISE 
THAT'S A RATTLESNAKE 
OBVIOUSLY TAKING SHELTER FROM THE HEAT JUST AS THE TORTOISE IS 
THE TORTOISE IS SO WELL ARMOURED IT'S IN NO DANGER FROM THE SNAKE 
AND GOPHER TORTOISES DON'T SEEM TO MIND SHARING THEIR BURROWS 
A HA 
IT'S CHANGED ITS MIND THERE'S ITS RATTLE 
OVER ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT SPECIES OF ANIMAL 
HAVE BEEN RECORDED TAKING SHELTER INSIDE TORTOISES' TUNNELS 
IN FACT SOME CAN LIVE NOWHERE ELSE 
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER REASON WHY TORTOISES' HOMES ARE SO POPULAR 
TORTOISES ARE ONE OF THE FEW ANIMALS HERE THAT CAN ACTUALLY DIG 
EACH MAY HAVE MORE THAN ONE BURROW WITHIN ITS TERRITORY AND THAT'S VERY VALUABLE 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH AN EVEN GREATER DANGER THAN SUNSTROKE 
BUSH FIRES 
THESE ARE A MAJOR AND RECURRENT THREAT 
TO ALL THE ANIMALS THAT LIVE HERE 
TORTOISE TUNNELS ARE INVALUABLE PLACES IN WHICH TO TAKE REFUGE 
GOPHER TORTOISES MAY SEEM TO BE UNASSUMING CREATURES 
BUT THEIR ENGINEERING SKILLS ARE ESSENTIAL 
FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE WHOLE ECOSYSTEM 
THE GROUND IS STILL SMOKING 
BUT THE FLAMES HAVE PASSED AND THE EMERGENCY IS OVER 
SO BY DIGGING TUNNELS TORTOISES SAVE NOT ONLY THEIR LIVES 
BUT THE LIVES OF HUNDREDS OF OTHER ANIMALS 
BUT TUNNELS AREN'T THE ONLY PLACE WHERE YOU CAN ESCAPE EXTREMES OF TEMPERATURE 
THERE'S ANOTHER ENVIRONMENT THAT'S COOLER AND EVEN MORE STABLE 
WATER 
SOME OF THE ANCESTRAL TORTOISES STARTED TO SPEND ALL THEIR TIME THERE 
AND BECAME TURTLES 
SOME STILL WALK SLOWLY ALONG THE BOTTOM 
IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS THEIR ANCESTORS WALKED ON LAND 
WATER IS A GOOD PLACE FOR A COLD BLOODED ANIMAL TO LIVE 
IT RETAINS ITS WARMTH THROUGH THE NIGHT AND STAYS COMFORTABLY COOL DURING THE HEAT OF THE DAY 
SO TURTLES ARE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE RELATIVELY CONSTANT WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY 
MANY HAVE DEVELOPED WEBS BETWEEN THEIR TOES 
AND HAVE BECOME VERY EFFICIENT SWIMMERS 
THE MOST AQUATIC OF ALL FRESHWATER TURTLES IS FOUND IN NEW GUINEA 
AND A FEW RIVERS LIKE THIS ONE IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA 
THE PIG NOSED TURTLE 
ITS FEET HAVE BECOME COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED INTO FLIPPERS 
AND ARE OF LITTLE USE ON LAND 
AND INDEED THE PIG NOSED TURTLE RARELY COMES ASHORE 
BUT TURTLES ARE DESCENDED FROM LAND LIVING ANCESTORS 
AND SO THEY STILL NEED TO BREATHE AIR 
FEMALES ALSO HAVE TO RETURN TO LAND IN ORDER TO LAY THEIR EGGS 
PIG NOSES NEST DURING THE DRY SEASON HIGH UP ON THE RIVER BANK 
IF TURTLE EGGS GET WET THE BABIES INSIDE THEM WILL DROWN 
AT LEAST THAT IS THE CASE WITH MOST TURTLES 
AN EGG FOR A TURTLE REPRESENTS A HUGE INVESTMENT 
AS IT DOES FOR ANY REPTILE 
SO TURTLES GO TO A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE 
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY LAY THEIR EGGS IN SAFE DRY PLACES 
SO YOU WOULD THINK THAT DROPPING ONE INTO WATER WOULD BE A DISASTER 
BUT WATCH 
A FULLY DEVELOPED BABY TURTLE 
AND IT'S COME FROM AN EGG WHICH AS FAR AS WE KNOW 
IS UNIQUE IN THE REPTILE WORLD 
IT CAN NOT ONLY SURVIVE BEING FLOODED 
IT ACTUALLY REQUIRES TO BE SUBMERGED IN WATER IN ORDER TO HATCH 
THIS ENABLES THE PIG NOSE TO MAKE THE HATCHING OF ITS EGGS 
COINCIDE WITH THE ONSET OF THE RAINY SEASON 
A VIEW INSIDE THE EGG WOULD SHOW THE BABIES TO BE FULLY DEVELOPED 
THEY CAN REMAIN THERE IN A KIND OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION 
IF NECESSARY FOR WEEKS 
WHEN THE RAINS FINALLY ARRIVE THEY ARE TORRENTIAL 
THE RIVER RISES SWIFTLY AND SOON THE NESTS ARE FLOODED 
THIS WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR MOST TURTLES 
BUT THE UNHATCHED PIG NOSES ARE READY FOR IT 
INDEED ITS THE MOMENT THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR 
THEIR UNIQUE WAITING STRATEGY ENSURES THAT NO MATTER HOW LATE THE RAINS ARE 
THE YOUNG TURTLES ONLY EMERGE WHEN THE RIVERS ARE FULL 
AND THERE'S PLENTY TO EAT 
THEY'RE ABLE TO SWIM IMMEDIATELY 
IN DUE COURSE 
THE FEMALES AMONG THEM WILL RETURN HERE TO LAY EGGS THEMSELVES 
THE MALES HOWEVER WILL NEVER SET FOOT ON DRY LAND AGAIN 
NO TURTLES ARE BETTER SUITED TO LIFE IN FRESHWATER THAN THE PIG NOSE 
BUT THE MOST EXTREME ADAPTATIONS FOR SWIMMING 
ARE FOUND IN THOSE TURTLES THAT WENT TO SEA 
MARINE TURTLES HAVE ALTERED THEIR FRONT LEGS REALLY RADICALLY 
AND TURNED THEM INTO OAR LIKE FLIPPERS 
THEY'RE SO AT HOME IN THE SEA THEY EVEN MATE WHILE SWIMMING 
A MALE TURTLE HAS SPECIAL HOOKS ON HIS FRONT FLIPPERS 
THAT ENABLE HIM TO CLING ON TO THE FEMALE'S SHELL 
AND HE HAS TO HAVE A FIRM GRIP 
FOR SHE MAKES NO ALLOWANCE FOR HIM AS SHE SWIMS 
BUT HANGING ON TO HIS FEMALE IS GOING TO GET MUCH HARDER FOR THIS MALE 
A RIVAL HAS APPEARED 
THE MALE'S ARMOUR PROTECTS MOST OF HIS BODY 
BUT HIS REAR FLIPPERS ARE EXPOSED 
AND THEY ARE RELATIVELY SOFT AND VULNERABLE 
THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THIS HURTS 
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT THE FIRST MALE CAN DO ABOUT IT 
IF HE LETS GO WITH EVEN A SINGLE FLIPPER HE WILL LOSE HIS GRIP 
AND HIS FEMALE 
THE RIVAL TRIES AGAIN AND ATTACKS THE FRONT FLIPPER 
ARE ABOUT TO DOUBLE 
A SECOND RIVAL ARRIVES 
THE TWO CHALLENGERS JOIN FORCES AND ATTACK THE MALE FROM BOTH SIDES 
HIS ONLY OPTION IS TO GRIN AND BEAR IT 
NOW A THIRD HOPEFUL MALE JOINS IN 
THE FEMALE TRIES TO SHAKE THEM OFF BUT THERE'S NO SHIFTING THEM 
IT'S GOING FROM BAD TO WORSE 
EVEN MORE MALES GANG UP ON THE HAPLESS COUPLE 
SOME OF THE GANG TRY TO FORCE THEMSELVES BETWEEN THE MATING PAIR 
THE PAIR HAVE NOW BEEN SUBMERGED FOR A LONG TIME 
AND BOTH OF THEM ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF A BREATH 
IF THE RIVALS CAN PREVENT THE MALE FROM REACHING THE SURFACE 
HE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO LET GO 
HE'S IN REAL DANGER OF DROWNING 
AT LAST THE DETERMINED COUPLE BREAK FREE 
AND MAKE A DASH FOR THE SURFACE 
WITH A WELCOME GASP OF AIR THE PAIR ESCAPE 
ONE BY ONE THE GANG GIVE UP 
IT WAS OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO THAT THE FIRST TURTLES TOOK TO THE WATER 
BUT THEY WERE NOT ALONE 
ANOTHER GROUP OF REPTILES WERE ALSO MAKING THE SAME MOVE 
AND THEY TOO WERE ARMOURED GIANTS 
CROCODILIANS LIKE TURTLES AND TORTOISES 
HAVE BARELY CHANGED SINCE THE TIME OF THE DINOSAURS 
TODAY CROCODILES CAYMAN AND ALLIGATORS LIVE IN TROPICAL WATERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 
CROCODILES AND TORTOISES ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY DIFFERENT 
BUT THEY DO HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON ARMOUR 
THEIR BODIES ARE ENCASED BY TOUGH THICK SCALES 
PARTICULARLY ALONG THE BACK 
IN TORTOISES THAT ARMOUR IS CLEARLY DEFENSIVE 
BUT FOR CROCODILES IT HAS AN EXTRA FUNCTION 
JUST BELOW EACH OF THESE SCALES LIES A NETWORK OF BLOOD VESSELS 
A CROCODILE CAN CONTROL THE FLOW OF THE BLOOD WITHIN THEM 
WHEN BASKING IT ALLOWS IT TO CIRCULATE FREELY 
SO TRANSFERRING THE SUN'S WARMTH FROM THESE RIDGED SCALES 
TO THE REST OF ITS BODY 
THE CROCODILE IN SHORT HAS ROWS OF VERY EFFECTIVE SOLAR PANELS 
ALL DOWN ITS BACK 
AND A SOPHISTICATED SOLAR HEATING SYSTEM LIKE THAT 
IS A VERY VALUABLE FACILITY FOR A COLD BLOODED CREATURE 
BEING COLD BLOODED BRINGS CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGES TO A CROCODILE 
WHEREAS A WARM BLOODED PREDATOR LIKE A LION WOULD DIE 
IF IT DIDN'T FEED EVERY FEW DAYS 
A CROCODILE IF NECESSARY CAN GO WITHOUT FOOD FOR MONTHS ON END 
AND THAT MEANS THAT CROCODILES CAN LIVE IN PLACES 
WHERE NO WARM BLOODED PREDATOR COULD SURVIVE 
AND WAIT FOR EVENTS THAT ONLY HAPPEN TWO OR THREE TIMES EACH YEAR 
AND ONE OF THOSE EVENTS WILL OCCUR TONIGHT RIGHT HERE 
THIS ROAD IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA IS CLOSE TO THE COAST 
AND IT FLOODS AT THE HIGHEST TIDES 
NIGHT FALLS AND THE SCENE CHANGES DRAMATICALLY 
BUT THIS IS NO RANDOM GATHERING 
THE CROCODILES ARE ALL HERE FOR A REASON 
WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE TRAVELLED OVER SIXTY MILES ONE HUNDRED K. M. TO GET HERE 
BUT HOW THEY KNOW WHEN TO COME HERE WE HAVE LITTLE IDEA 
THERE MUST BE SOME FORTY CROCODILES 
ASSEMBLED IN THE RIVER BEHIND ME 
AND WHAT MAKES THIS SIGHT ALL THE MORE REMARKABLE 
IS THAT THESE ARE SALTWATER CROCODILES 
WHICH ARE NORMALLY VERY TERRITORIAL AND INTOLERANT OF ONE ANOTHER 
SO THERE MUST BE SOMETHING PRETTY SPECIAL HAPPENING IN THE RIVER TONIGHT 
AND INDEED THERE IS 
THIS RIVER IS TIDAL 
BUT IT'S BEEN CROSSED BY A BARRAGE 
HOWEVER AT PARTICULARLY HIGH TIDES 
THE WATER FLOWS OVER THE BARRAGE 
AND THAT IS THE MOMENT THAT ALL THESE CROCODILES ARE WAITING FOR 
WITH THE SALTWATER COME FISH 
MULLET HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR WEEKS TO MIGRATE UP THE RIVER TO BREED 
THIS HIGH TIDE IS THEIR FIRST CHANCE TO CROSS THE BARRAGE 
AND THE CROCODILES ARE WAITING FOR THEM 
REMEMBER IT'S NOW PITCH DARK 
OUR INFRA RED CAMERAS GIVE US A CLEAR VIEW 
BUT THE CROCODILES CAN SEE VIRTUALLY NOTHING 
SO THEY WAIT WITH OPEN JAWS READY TO SNAP THEM SHUT AT THE FIRST TOUCH OF A FISH 
NORMALLY SALTWATER CROCODILES WOULD NOT TOLERATE BEING SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER 
THEY DO COMPETE FOR THE BEST FISHING SPOTS 
BUT THEIR DISPUTES ARE SETTLED WITH THE MINIMUM OF FUSS 
THE FISH KEEP COMING FOR OVER AN HOUR 
BUT AS THE TIDE STARTS TO FALL SO THEIR NUMBERS DWINDLE 
WITH SO MANY CROCODILES COMPETING SOME INEVITABLY GO HUNGRY 
BUT FOR THOSE THAT STAY AROUND THERE WILL BE A SECOND BITE TO THIS PARTICULAR CHERRY 
THE NEXT HIGH TIDE COMES DURING THE DAY AND BRINGS YET MORE FISH 
THE CROCODILES CAN NOW SEE THE FISH BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE THEM ANY EASIER TO CATCH 
THESE SKILFUL HUNTERS ARE SURELY DRAMATIC PROOF 
THAT REPTILES ARE CERTAINLY NOT SIMPLE MINDED CREATURES 
THEY'VE PREDICTED THE TIME OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE FISH 
WITH ASTONISHING ACCURACY AND THEY HAVE WORKED OUT JUST WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO CATCH THEM 
THEY HAVE ALSO MANAGED TO SUPPRESS THEIR NORMAL ANTAGONISM 
TO ONE ANOTHER SO THAT THEY CAN ALL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BONANZA 
THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT CROCODILES THE MORE WE REALISE WHAT COMPLEX CREATURES THEY ARE 
DESPITE WHAT YOU THINK CROCODILIANS ARE AMONG THE MOST TALKATIVE OF REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS 
INDEED THEY ARE SECOND ONLY TO THE FROGS IN THE VARIETY OF NOISES THAT THEY MAKE 
THE MOST IMPRESSIVE OF THESE SOUNDS COME FROM THE AMERICAN ALLIGATOR 
WHEN THE BREEDING SEASON STARTS THE MALES BEGIN TO PROCLAIM THEIR OWNERSHIP OF TERRITORIES 
THE VIBRATIONS IN HIS BODY ARE SO POWERFUL THEY MAKE THE WATER DANCE ALONG HIS BACK 
SOUND TRAVELS THROUGH WATER EVEN BETTER THAN IT DOES THROUGH AIR 
AND HE CAN BE HEARD BY OTHER ALLIGATORS HUNDREDS OF METRES AWAY 
THIS IS A CLEAR STATEMENT OF OWNERSHIP OF TERRITORY 
THAT'S FINE WHEN HE DOES IT LYING IN HIS OWN PATCH 
BUT WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HE BELLOWS CLOSE TO ANOTHER MALE 
BUT THE RIVALS DON'T COME TO BLOWS 
THEY SORT OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES WITH GESTURES 
HEAD SLAPS AND GAPING JAWS ARE VERY OBVIOUS SIGNALS 
BUT ALLIGATORS ALSO SEND MESSAGES IN LESS CONSPICUOUS WAYS 
RAISING THEIR BACKS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WATER IS A SIGNIFICANT MOVE 
IT'S A CLAIM TO DOMINANCE 
USING SIGNALS THAT ARE ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE TO US ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE 
SENDING MESSAGES TO EACH OTHER MAKING CLAIM AND COUNTER CLAIM 
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ALLIGATORS CAN BE VERY SUBTLE 
QUIET BUT THERE ARE SOME OCCASIONS 
WHEN THEY REALLY WANT TO MAKE THEIR MEANING VERY UNAMBIGUOUSLY CLEAR 
AND ONE OF THOSE IS WHEN THEY'RE GUARDING THEIR NESTS 
AS THIS ONE IS 
I THINK THAT WAS PRETTY CLEAR 
ANYWAY I WON'T PRESS THE POINT 
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CROCODILES STARTS EVEN BEFORE THEY'VE HATCHED 
A TRANQUIL POOL IN ARGENTINA AND IN IT A FEMALE BROAD SNOUTED CAYMAN 
SHE LAID HER EGGS IN A PILE OF VEGETATION CLOSE TO THE WATER ALMOST THREE MONTHS AGO 
NOW SOUNDS ARE COMING FROM IT 
THE EGGS ARE BEGINNING TO HATCH 
EVEN WHILE THE EGGS ARE STILL 
WITHIN THE NEST THEIR MOTHER CAN HEAR THEM FROM SOME WAY AWAY 
BACK ON THE NEST SHE LISTENS INTENTLY 
THEN VERY GENTLY SHE STARTS TO TAKE IT APART 
SHE CAN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE EACH OF HER BABIES IS AND STOPS EVERY FEW SECONDS TO LISTEN 
AT LAST THE YOUNG ARE FREE 
BUT SHE DOESN'T ABANDON THEM 
SHE IS GOING TO TAKE THEM DOWN TO THE POOL THAT SHE'S SELECTED AS THEIR NURSERY 
SOME BABIES START TO MAKE THE JOURNEY FOR THEMSELVES 
BUT THEY CONTINUE TO CALL AND THAT HELPS THEIR MOTHER LOCATE THEM 
CAYMAN JAWS ARE AMONG THE STRONGEST IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM 
BUT NOW SHE USES HERS WITH THE GREATEST DELICACY AND GENTLENESS 
SO AT LAST HER BABIES ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THE NURSERY POOL 
BUT THEIR MOTHER'S JOB IS STILL NOT FINISHED 
SEVERAL OF THE EGGS HAVE FAILED TO HATCH 
ONE BY ONE SHE TAKES THESE IN HER MOUTH 
THE SHELL AROUND THE EGG IS QUITE STRONG 
THE BABIES MUST MAKE A CONSIDERABLE EFFORT TO FREE THEMSELVES 
AND FOR SOME IT'S MORE THAN THEY CAN MANAGE 
SO SHE STARTS TO CRACK THE UNHATCHED EGG WITH HER TEETH 
ONCE THE HARD SHELL HAS BEEN BROKEN AWAY SHE HAS TO PIERCE THE LEATHERY INNER MEMBRANE 
WITHOUT HER HELP THIS BABY MIGHT NOT HAVE HATCHED AT ALL 
BUT THE FEMALE CAYMAN'S MATERNAL DUTIES ARE NOT OVER EVEN NOW 
SHE WILL STAND GUARD OVER HER BABIES FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS 
ALL CROCODILIANS TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEIR YOUNG 
BUT ONE OF THEM TAKES PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO A REALLY ASTONISHING LEVEL 
THE LLANOS OF VENEZUELA A LUSH WETLAND TEEMING WITH WILDLIFE OF ALL KINDS 
AS WELL AS BIRDS THERE ARE AMPHIBIOUS RODENTS CAPYBARA AND SPECTACLED CAYMAN 
THIS FEMALE IS LOOKING AFTER AN EXTRAORDINARILY LARGE NUMBER OF BABIES 
BUT MOST OF THESE ARE NOT IN FACT HERS 
THIS NURSERY POOL IS BEING USED BY SEVERAL CAYMAN FAMILIES 
BUT INSTEAD OF ALL THE MOTHERS STAYING NEARBY ONE OF THEM HAS TAKEN CHARGE OF THE WHOLE CRECHE 
KEEPING AN EYE ON ALL THESE ENERGETIC BABIES IS NOT EASY 
THERE ARE LOTS OF ENEMIES AROUND 
WHEN DANGER THREATENS THE BABIES ALL RUN FOR PROTECTION 
TO THE FEMALE EVEN THOUGH SHE MAY NOT BE THEIR MOTHER 
THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR THEM ALL ON HER BACK 
SOON THESE BABIES WILL FACE ANOTHER HAZARD ONE THAT'S NOT QUITE SO EASY TO ESCAPE FROM 
THE WATER THAT HAS KEPT THEM SAFE UNTIL NOW IS BEGINNING TO DRY UP 
EACH YEAR IN THE SPACE OF A FEW SHORT MONTHS 
THE LLANOS IS TRANSFORMED FROM A FLOODED PARADISE TO A BAKING OVEN 
FOR SOME BABIES THE UNRELENTING HEAT AND THE LACK OF WATER HAS ALREADY BEEN TOO MUCH 
ANY BABIES THAT ARE LEFT ALIVE WILL CERTAINLY DIE IF THEY STAY HERE 
SO THE MOTHER DECIDES TO LEAVE 
CALLING TO HER CRECHE SHE SETS OFF ACROSS THE PARCHED LAND 
IN ONE LONG CAVALCADE THEY MARCH ONWARDS IN SEARCH OF PERMANENT WATER 
FOR THE MOTHER THIS IS CERTAINLY EXHAUSTING 
FOR HER BABIES WITH THEIR TINY LEGS IT MUST BE A REAL MARATHON 
SOME START TO FALL BEHIND 
BUT SHE STOPS 
THE BABIES CALL CONSTANTLY 
SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE THEY ALL ARE AND WAITS UNTIL EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAS CAUGHT UP 
ONLY WHEN ALL ARE WITH HER WILL SHE SET OFF AGAIN 
AT LAST SAFETY 
THE BABIES ARE CLOSE TO EXHAUSTION 
WITHOUT SUCH DEVOTION FROM THE FEMALE FEW IF ANY OF THESE BABY CAYMAN WOULD HAVE SURVIVED 
AND REMARKABLY MOST OF THEM AREN'T EVEN HER OWN 
WHEN PARENTAL CARE WAS FIRST DESCRIBED IN CROCODILES 
THE REPORTS WERE DISMISSED AS TOO EXTRAORDINARY TO BE TRUE 
WE MAY CALL REPTILES COLD BLOODED BUT THEY CAN SHOW GREAT TENDERNESS 
REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS ARE FULL OF SURPRISES 
THEY CAN LOOK AFTER THEIR YOUNG WITH AS MUCH CARE AS MANY A MAMMAL 
THEIR DISPLAYS CAN BE AS COLOURFUL AS THAT OF ANY BIRD 
AND THEY CAN ASTONISH AND ENTHRAL US 
REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS ARE SOMETIMES SEEN AS SIMPLE PRIMITIVE CREATURES 
THAT'S A LONG WAY FROM THE TRUTH 
THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SOLAR POWERED 
MEANS THAT THEIR BODIES REQUIRE ONLY TEN PER CENT OF THE ENERGY THAT MAMMALS OF A SIMILAR SIZE REQUIRE 
AT A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH WE GET OUR ENERGY FROM THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND THE WASTEFUL WAY IN WHICH WE USE IT 
MAYBE THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM LIFE IN COLD BLOOD 
WE FILMED A LOT OF DIFFERENT REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS DURING THE MAKING OF THIS SERIES 
WE WERE LOOKING FOR EXTRAORDINARY BEHAVIOUR PREFERABLY FOR THINGS THAT HAD NEVER BEEN FILMED BEFORE 
TO SEE SUCH WONDERS WE NEEDED THE HELP OF SCIENTISTS WHO WERE WORKING IN THE FIELD 
THEY PASSED ONTO US THEIR INSIGHTS AND THEIR DISCOVERIES 
AND THEN THEY HELPED US TO INTERPRET THE FOOTAGE THAT WE'D SHOT I LEARNT A LOT AND HAD A LOT OF FUN 
BUT I WAS ALSO ALARMED TO DISCOVER JUST HOW RARE SOME OF THE SUBJECTS OF OUR SERIES HAVE NOW BECOME 
ONE OF OUR KEY LOCATIONS WAS THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS 
HERE GIANT TORTOISES WERE GOING TO BE AMONG OUR STARS 
THE SCIENTISTS WORKING FOR THE GALAPAGOS NATIONAL PARKS CARE FOR THE WILD ANIMAL POPULATIONS 
BUT THEY ALSO LOOK AFTER ONE EXTRAORDINARY UNIQUE INDIVIDUAL 
WITH WHOM I HAD A SPECIAL APPOINTMENT 
THIS IS THE RAREST LIVING ANIMAL IN ALL THE WORLD 
THERE IS NONE RARER 
THIS IS LONESOME GEORGE 
HE'S ABOUT THE SAME AGES AS I AM BUT HIS STORY STARTS A VERY LONG TIME AGO 
IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WHEN HUMAN BEINGS FIRST CAME TO THE GALAPAGOS 
THERE WERE ABOUT FIFTEEN DIFFERENT KINDS OF GIANT TORTOISE 
EACH LIVING ON ITS OWN ISLAND OR ITS OWN GREAT VOLCANO 
ISOLATED BY IMPASSABLE LAVA FLOWS 
THERE ARE THIRTEEN LARGE ISLANDS IN THE GALAPAGOS AND MANY SMALLER ONES 
AND THEY DIFFER IN BOTH AGE AND THEIR VEGETATION 
THE TORTOISES DIFFER TOO BECAUSE THEIR SHELLS HAVE EVOLVED INTO 
THE DIFFERENT SHAPES BEST SUITED FOR EATING THE FOOD AVAILABLE ON THEIR OWN PARTICULAR ISLAND 
ON ISLANDS WHERE THERE'S ABUNDANT FOOD ON THE GROUND 
THE TORTOISES HAVE DOME SHAPED SHELLS AND SHORT NECKS THAT ONLY NEED REACH DOWNWARDS 
BUT ON ISLANDS WHERE TORTOISES BROWSE ON HIGHER BUSHES THEIR NECKS ARE LONGER AND THE SHELLS 
ARE SADDLE SHAPED AT THE FRONT SO THEY CAN STRETCH THEIR NECKS UPWARDS 
WHEN THE FIRST SHIPS ARRIVED HERE THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF EACH KIND OF TORTOISE 
BUT THEN PEOPLE BEGAN TO SLAUGHTER THE TORTOISES FOR MEAT 
THEY DISCOVERED THE REMARKABLE FACT THAT THESE CREATURES COULD LIVE 
FOR A YEAR WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD 
SO THEY TOOK THEM ON BOARD THEIR SHIPS AND SLAUGHTERED THEM AT SEA 
THE TORTOISES ON PINTA ISLAND WERE APPARENTLY EXTERMINATED 
BUT THEN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE 
IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS ONE LONELY SINGLE SURVIVOR 
THAT WAS LONESOME GEORGE 
THIS FILM WAS TAKEN OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO BY THE TEAM 
THAT BROUGHT GEORGE BACK TO THE CHARLES DARWIN RESEARCH STATION 
THE SCIENTISTS HOPED THAT ANOTHER PINTA TORTOISE MIGHT BE DISCOVERED 
IN SOME CORNER OF THIS ISLAND OR EVEN IN A ZOO SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD BUT NONE HAS EVER BEEN FOUND 
SO NOW GEORGE LIVES IN HIS OWN ENCLOSURE COMPLETELY SAFE BUT ENTIRELY BY HIMSELF 
HE'S THE LAST OF HIS KIND 
IT'S BETTER NEWS FOR THE OTHER GALAPAGOS TORTOISES 
FELIPE CRUZ FROM THE RESEARCH STATION SHOWED ME SOME OF THE WORK BEING DONE THERE 
THEY TAKE EGGS LAID BY WILD TORTOISES AND PUT THEM IN INCUBATORS 
THE HATCHLINGS ARE ABOUT THE SIZE OF APPLES AND HAVE SOFT SHELLS SO ARE VULNERABLE TO PREDATORS 
ESPECIALLY RATS THAT WERE ACCIDENTALLY INTRODUCED TO THE GALAPAGOS 
THE YOUNG ONES I SAW WERE ONLY A FEW MONTHS OLD 
THEY'RE KEPT IN SPECIAL ENCLOSURES AND GIVEN ALL THE FOODS 
THEY NEED TO ENABLE THEM TO DEVELOP HARD PROTECTIVE SHELLS 
IT TAKES A FEW MONTHS FOR THEIR SHELLS TO HARDEN 
AND IT'S FIVE YEARS BEFORE THEY'RE TOTALLY PREDATOR PROOF 
SO FAR IN TOTAL WE HAVE REPATRIATED OVER THREE THOUSAND TORTOISES 
THREE THOUSAND 
SCIENTISTS ARE ALSO HELPING TO SOLVE ANOTHER MAN MADE PROBLEM 
DOMESTIC GOATS THAT HAVE RUN WILD ARE EATING THE TORTOISES' FOOD AND DESTROYING THE PRECIOUS PLANT COVER 
THAT THEY USE FOR SHADE SO A SYSTEMATIC PROGRAMME OF ERADICATION HAS STARTED 
I WAS ABLE TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF THIS PROGRAMME FOR MYSELF 
WE VISITED ONE ISLAND WHERE TWO YEARS EARLIER 
THE GOATS HAD BEEN ELIMINATED AND THE DIFFERENCE WAS DRAMATIC THE LUSH VEGETATION HAD RETURNED 
NOW THE TORTOISES CAN FIND THE SHADE THAT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THEM 
AND THERE'S PLENTY OF GRASS FOR THEM TO EAT 
REPTILES ARE NOT ALONE IN BEING UNDER THREAT 
THE AMPHIBIANS IF ANYTHING ARE IN EVEN GREATER DANGER 
NOT SINCE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE DINOSAURS HAS A WHOLE GROUP 
OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM BEEN UNDER SUCH THREAT 
IN JAPAN ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC AMPHIBIANS THE GIANT SALAMANDER HAS FEWER AND FEWER PLACES TO LIVE 
IN PANAMA WE FILMED THE GOLDEN FROG 
SINCE WE TOOK THIS SHOT THE SPECIES HAS BECOME SO RARE 
THAT THE FEW SURVIVORS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT TO BE PROTECTED IN ZOOS SO IT'S NOW EXTINCT IN THE WILD 
THE GHARIALS THAT WE FILMED WITH THEIR BABIES WERE NEARLY 
EXTERMINATED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN THEY LOST MOST OF THEIR NATURAL HABITAT AND THEY'RE NOT SAFE YET 
TO TRY AND HALT THEIR DECLINE THEIR EGGS ARE BEING COLLECTED HATCHED IN INCUBATORS 
AND THE BABIES REARED IN CAPTIVITY UNTIL THEY CAN BE RELEASED IN THE WILD 
SO THERE MAY BE HOPE FOR THEM YET THE GOPHER TORTOISE WE FILMED IN FLORIDA IS ALSO IN TROUBLE 
THE AREAS WHERE IT DIGS ITS BURROWS HAVE BECOME PRIME REAL ESTATE 
AND ARE NOW MUCH SOUGHT AFTER FOR BUILDING AND FARMING 
BY EXPLAINING THEIR PROBLEMS TO LANDOWNERS AND DEVELOPERS 
THEY MAY YET HAVE A FUTURE 
IN THE GREAT ISLAND OF MADAGASCAR THERE ARE MORE SPECIES OF CHAMELEON 
THAN IN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD PUT TOGETHER 
BUT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ISLAND'S FORESTS BEGAN CENTURIES AGO AND ONLY A FEW PATCHES ARE LEFT 
THEY TOO ARE STILL BEING FELLED AND CHAMELEON SPECIES MAY BE LOST 
EVEN BEFORE THEY'VE BEEN IDENTIFIED 
WE WILL NEED TO ACT NOW IF WE'RE NOT TO LOSE WHAT REMAINS TO US 
OF THE REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS THAT HAVE SURVIVED FOR TWO HUNDRED MILLION YEARS 
LONESOME GEORGE IT SEEMS IS DOOMED TO BE LAST OF HIS KIND 
BUT AT LEAST HE CAN BE A LIVING INSPIRATION FOR US ALL TO PROTECT THE REMAINDER 
OF THE REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS OF THE WORLD
