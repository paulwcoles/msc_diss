BLUE MASH BLUE BAKE ROAST POTATOES 
THAT'S WHAT PRINCE WOULD HAVE FOR HIS DINNER THE OLD PURPLE SPUDS

WE PUT IT ON PEOPLE'S PLATE THEY CUT INTO IT JUST MIND BLOWING 
WHICH IS THE BEST ROASTER 
ARRAN VICTORY BECAUSE IT'S GOT A VERY FLOURY FLESH SO IT MAKES BEAUTIFUL FLUFFY ROAST POTATOES 
CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE FLUFFY ON THE MIDDLE IT'S A BIT LIKE YOURSELF 
WHAT'S YOUR BEST CHIPPER 
THE ULTIMATE LUXURY IS AN INDIVIDUAL CHIP MADE OUT OF PINK FIR APPLE 
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO CHIP WELL BUT THEY DO 
IT LOOKS LIKE AN ACID TRIP 
IT'S CHANGING THE HUMBLE SPUD INTO SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL 
WE HAVE SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL TO COOK 
WE'RE DOING THE ULTIMATE FISH PIE 
NOW FOR OUR POTATO TOP WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST 
FOR THE MASHED POTATO TOP I WOULD SUGGEST DUNBAR ROVER WHICH IS THIS ONE HERE 
IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY PRETTY BUT NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER 
IT WAS DEVELOPED IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX AND IT'S A GREAT MASHING POTATO 
AND THE FLAVOUR IS IT'S JUST A FABULOUS FLAVOUR SO WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME OF THOSE FOR YOUR FISH PIE 
SOLD MADAM TO THE TWO WET MEN WITH BEARDS THANKS PLEASURE 
AS WE HEAD SOUTH ON OUR HOME RUN TO NEWCASTLE IT'S MY TURN TO REGRESS INTO CHILDHOOD 
AND THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE FOR MEMORIES TO COME FLOODING BACK THAN THE BEACH BY BAMBURGH CASTLE 
HAVEN'T DONE THIS FOR A WHILE 
WE USED TO COME UP HERE ALL YEAR MOST WEEKENDS HAIL RAIN SNOW IT WAS FREEZING 
IF YOU WAITED FOR THE WEATHER IN NORTHUMBERLAND YOU'D NEVER GO OUT 
IT'S YOUR VIKING BLOOD ALL THOSE DAYS AT SEA ON A LONGSHIP 
THIS BEACH DAVE BECAUSE ALL MY CHILDHOOD WAS SPENT ON HERE 
IT ALWAYS REMINDS US OF ME DAD 
TOP TOP BLOKE 
AND MY DAD WOULD DO THIS COWBOY BREAKFAST WHICH CONSISTED OF BAKED BEANS 
AND FRIED BACON IN A FRYING PAN IN THE BACK OF A CAR

YOU'D BE STOOD THERE GOING I BET IT WAS THE BEST THING EVER IT WAS FANTASTIC 
HOW OLD WERE YOU SI WHEN YOUR DAD DIED EIGHT 
MUST HAVE BEEN HARD IT WAS HARD FINANCIALLY AND IT WAS HARD FOR MAM

THE DOCTOR SAID SHE'S NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO WALK AGAIN PROPERLY 
AND MY DAD SAID REALLY THERE'S NO DAUGHTER OF MINE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO WALK PROPERLY

THERE WAS NO WAY A DAUGHTER OF HIS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FULFIL HER POTENTIAL 
WE SHOULD GO TO ME MAM'S WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE DAYS AGO

I THINK YOU OD'D ON THE ICE CREAM CONES MATE 
THEY'RE TURRETS YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE TURRETS 
THE LAST LEG OF OUR JOURNEY TAKES US FINALLY INTO MY HOMETOWN NEWCASTLE THE CITY THAT SPAWNED BROWN ALE 
ANT AND DEC AND THE MOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE ACCENT THIS SIDE OF WATFORD 
EE HADDAWAY MAN I DINNA KNAA WHIT YE'RE TAAKIN' ABOOT YA BIG GADGIE EXACTLY 
OUR DESTINATION IS THE FAVOURITE RETREAT FOR ALL BIKERS IN THE NORTH THE AVALON HOTEL 
AND TONIGHT THEY'RE HAVING A COMPETITION 
THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE BETWEEN THE CUMBRIA PIE AND THE GEORDIE PIE 
WHICH IS BEST AND THE JUDGES WILL BE THE BIKERS 
ARE YOU ALL STARVING AYE 
IT'S STARTED THE PIE OFF KITCHEN 
HELLO TEAMS HOW ARE YOU 
NOW IN THE GREEN CORNER WE HAVE WATCH IT WE HAVE DAVE AND CAROL FROM GREEN'S PIES IN CUMBRIA 
AND IN THE BLACK AND WHITE CORNER SUPPORTING THE GEORDIE PIEFEST 
WE HAVE MICK AND KATH FROM THE AVALON WHITLEY BAY 
OH WHAT WE DID FORGET TO MENTION IS THAT WE'VE GOT MUSHY PEAS 
OR PUMPING PEAS AS WE CALL THEM BECAUSE THEY MAKE YOU PUMP 
STEP ONE IN THE MARTIAL ART OF MUSHY PEA PREPARATION 
THESE HAVE BEEN STEEPING IN A TUB OF BICARBONATE OF SODA FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
SO WE NEED TO RINSE THAT SAID BICARB OFF OR YOU'LL BE BACKFIRING LIKE A BADLY TUNED NORTON 
SIMPLY BRING TO A ROLLING BOIL FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR CHECK IT DOESN'T BOIL DRY AND COVER UP 
THE GEORDIES ARE OUT TO IMPRESS WITH THREE VARIETIES 
BUT THE CUMBRIANS BEING SENSITIVE TO OUR VEGETARIAN BRETHREN HAVE BROUGHT A CHEESE POTATO AND ONION 
THERE'S A CARROT THERE WE'LL PROBABLY SEE THAT AGAIN 
YES MUSHY PEAS 
GLADIATORS BY YOUR PIES 
PIE AND PEAS ARE IN THE ROOM WHO HASN'T GOT A PIE 
SO WHAT DO YOU RECKON SO FAR 
LOVELY I LIKE THE FLAT ONE BETTER THE FLAT ONE'S MUCH NICER 
THE GEORDIE'S 
ONLY ONE ANSWER GEORDIE PIE 
THAT ONE IT'S GOT MORE MEAT IN IT THAT ONE'S ALL POTATO 
WELL IT'S A MEAT AND POTATO PIE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT 
DAVE'S NOT HAPPY FOR SOME REASON HE THOUGHT IT WAS UNFAIR THAT MOST OF THE JUDGES WERE GEORDIES' 
I SUPPOSE I'D BETTER GO AND SIT IN A CORNER WITH A BOTTLE OF NEWCASTLE BROWN 
THE MOMENT OF DECISION THE PEAS ARE WORKING THROUGH I CAN SMELL THEM 
WELL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SHOW OF HANDS 
FOR THE CUMBRIAN PIES HANDS UP 
NOT BAD NOT BAD 
FOR THE GEORDIE PIES HANDS UP 
I THINK I KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING 
AT LEAST WE COOKED 'EM 
HANDS UP FOR THE PEAS 
SEE A BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATERS FOOD IS ISN'T IT IT CALMS TWO NATIONS 
IT'S NOT ALL PIES AND MUSHY PEAS UP NORTH YOU KNOW 
OH NO WE'RE HERE TO SEE CHEF TERRY LAYBOURNE AT HIS PLACE IN JESMOND DENE JUST OUTSIDE OF NEWCASTLE 
AND THIS IS TOP TOP TOP END CUISINE 
O. I. FATTY GET YOUR HAIR CUT 
ALL RIGHT HOW ARE YOU HELLO LADS HOW ARE YOU DOING 
NOT BAD NICE TO SEE YOU 
IT'S A DELIGHT TO GO INTO A REALLY IMPRESSIVE KITCHEN AND WATCH ONE OF THE TOP CHEFS IN BRITAIN AT WORK 
WHAT'S THIS TERRY WHAT ARE WE DOING 
WELL WE'RE COOKING A LITTLE BEEF DISH THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT COMPRISES OF TWO CUTS OF BEEF 
ONE THE FILLET LOVELY AND RARE TENDER AND COOKED VERY QUICKLY 
THE OTHER ONE IS A PIECE OF BEEF SHOULDER 
WHICH WE COOK VERY VERY VERY SLOWLY FOR ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS AT A REAL LOW TEMPERATURE 
WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT YOUR FOOD IT'S SIMPLE IT'S GENEROUS 
IT HAS A GEOGRAPHICAL FOCUS 
YOU KNOW WE WORK AS CLOSELY AS WE CAN WITH WHAT'S LOCAL AND THE HISTORY OF THE LOCALITY 
AND WE TRY AND WORK WITH DAMN GOOD PRODUCT YOU KNOW 
THERE'S ONE QUOTE OF YOURS IN YOUR BOOK WHICH WE'VE BOTH PINCHED AND IT'S NINETY PER CENT 
NINETY PER CENT OF GOOD COOKING IS GOOD SHOPPING YEAH I BELIEVE THAT 
WE'VE GOT THE SLOW COOKED BEEF AND THE REAL KEY TO IT 
IS THIS STRIP OF COLLAGEN HERE IN THE CENTRE YOU KNOW WHICH AS IT REHEATS 
WILL BECOME LOVELY AND GELATINOUS AND JUICY 
AND THE BIG CONTRAST IN THIS DISH IS WITH THE FILLET 
WE'VE GOT A CENTRE CUT FILLET HERE FROM ONE HUNDRED PER CENT ABERDEEN ANGUS ORGANIC 
SO WE'RE GOING TO BE FAIRLY GENEROUS AS WE ARE HERE IN THE NORTH EAST 
LITTLE BIT OF SALT 
L. ITTLE BIT OF OIL 
AND A FAIR AMOUNT OF HEAT 
THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE GENEROUS WITH THE PEPPER BEEF LOVES PEPPER YOU KNOW 
SO I'VE GOT A GOOD COLOUR THERE LOOK 
GREAT CARAMELISATION MORE PEPPER 
THEN I'M GOING TO HIT IT WITH A BIG PAT OF BUTTER 
MUCH DERIDED YOU KNOW THE BUTTER 
NOT BY US THAT'S WHY WE'RE THIS SHAPE TERRY 
I WANT THAT BUTTER TO BASTE THE BEEF 
TO GIVE IT COLOUR BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO GIVE IT FLAVOUR 
THEN AT THIS POINT WE'RE GOING TO POP IT IN A HOT OVEN FOR MAYBE THREE OR FOUR MINUTES THAT'S ALL 
DAVE AND I WE'RE NOT CHEFS WE'RE COOKS AND WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT COMING INTO AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE THIS 
IS THERE ARE LOADS OF BITS OF KIT ABOUT AND YOU MAKE SCENARIOS UP IN YOUR HEAD ABOUT WHAT THEY DO 
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS WRONG OH AYE I'VE NEVER GOT ONE RIGHT YET 
WHAT'S THAT IT'S A FRIDGE 
I'VE GOT A CRUST HERE BASED ON BREADCRUMBS AND BUTTER AND LOTS OF HERBS 
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT HAS SOME CHOPPED BEEF MARROW IN IT 
SO WHAT IT DOES IN A WAY IS SUPERCHARGE THE BEEFY FLAVOUR 
LITTLE BIT OF CELERIAC PUREE 
A NICE STICK OF SLOWLY BRAISED CELERY THERE 
THE BRAISED BEEF 
WILD MUSHROOMS AS WE KNOW BEEF LOVES MUSHROOMS 
WE'VE GOT A RED WINE SAUCE HERE MADE WITH A LOVELY BOTTLE OF BIG BRASSY RIOJA 
AND THE BRAISING LIQUOR FROM THE BEEF SHOULDER AND THERE WE HAVE IT 
OH LOOK AT THAT 
INSPIRED BY TERRY AND HIS HIGH END CUISINE 
WE THOUGHT WE'D GO FURTHER AFIELD AND DO SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT 
NOW FOR ONE OF OUR FAVOURITE RECIPES 
WE'VE COME OUT TO THE FROZEN LAKE IN GOTHENBURG 
IT'S FOR OUR TRIBUTE TO THE VIKING MARAUDERS 
WHO CAME PILLAGED AND COLONISED THESE PARTS AND LEFT BEHIND A LEGACY VIKING BLOOD 
GIVE OVER MAN WE'RE ON WHITLEY BAY ICE RINK 
I WAS JUST TRYING TO BUILD UP THE DRAMA 
NEVER MIND DOWN TO BUSINESS 
WE'RE DOING A GRAVADLAX 
GRAVADLAX IS A SWEDISH CURED SALMON 
IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE TO OUR SMOKED SALMON WHICH IS A BIT BORING NOW 
IT'S EVERYWHERE BUT GRAVADLAX IS BRILLIANT 
IT'S SO EASY TO DO AT HOME THERE ARE BONES 
IF YOU RUN YOUR FINGER DOWN THE FILLET YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND THEM AND FEEL THEM 
WITH A KNIFE AND YOUR FOREFINGER OR A PAIR OF TWEEZERS IF YOU WANT JUST PULL THE BONE OUT LIKE THAT 
GRAVADLAX IS A CURED FISH IT'S SALTED AND THE SALT DRAWS OUT 
ALL THE MOISTURE AND WHEN IT DOES THAT IT KIND OF COOKS THE FISH 
YOU PASS THE INGREDIENTS PIERRE AND I'LL MIX THE CURE 
NOW LISTEN I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU 
THIS IS REALLY SLIPPY 
OVER TO YOU MR. MAGOO 
THE BASIS OF ALL GOOD CURING IS YOUR SALT A NICE BUNCH OF FRESH DILL 
FRESH DILL 
SOME CASTER SUGAR THIS GIVES THE SALMON A NICE SWEETNESS 
I'D LIKE TO GO TO SWEDEN I'VE NEVER BEEN I'VE ALWAYS HAD A FASCINATION 
IT'S EVER SINCE YOU WATCHED THAT ABBA THING REMEMBER WATERLOO 
OH AGNETHA I LOVED HER AND ANY ADOLESCENT OF MY AGE WHO WASN'T IN LOVE WITH AGNETHA IS LYING 
FRIDA I QUITE LIKED FRIDA 
YOU SEE THEY LOOKED LIKE POP STARS 
BUT THOSE TWO BLOKES BENNY AND BJORN WERE LIKE TRAIN SPOTTERS 
THE ANORAK TWINS AYE HOW DID THEY PULL THOSE TWO MUST HAVE BEEN THE GRAVADLAX 
OUR TOP TRICK IN THIS IS WE CURE IT IN CUMIN AND SOME NICE RUNNY TREACLE 
WE WANT SOME SEA SALT FLAKES ON THE FOIL 
FIRST FILLET ON THERE 
AND THE LAST THING TO ADD TO THIS CURE IS SOME CRUSHED WHITE PEPPERCORNS 
AND THEN WITHOUT THE AID OF A PESTLE AND MORTAR HIT THE THING WITH THE TOP OF YOUR HELMET 
CRUSH THOSE CORNS CRUSH THOSE CORNS CRUSH THOSE PEPPERCORNS 
LOOK AT THAT LOVELY 
ALL WE DO NOW IS PILE THE CURING AGENT 
ONTO THE SALMON 
IT'S A LOT EASIER TO DO AT HOME 
WHEN IT HASN'T FROZEN TO ROCKS 
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO AND GET THAT LATER YOU 
TAKE THE OTHER PIECE OF FISH 
WHICH IS NOW AS STIFF AS A BOARD 
AND PLACE IT ON THERE LIKE A BIG SALMON SANDWICH 
THE SALT DRAWS THE FLUID OUT OF THE SALMON AND THE TREACLE 
THE CUMIN THE DILL 
WILL GO INTO THE SALMON 
THE TEXTURE OF THE SALMON ACTUALLY CHANGES BECAUSE OF ALL THAT MOISTURE THAT'S BEEN DRAWN OUT OF IT 
WRAP IT UP TIGHTLY IN A DOUBLE LAYER OF FOIL 
NOW THIS NEEDS TO BE PRESSED 
TAKE A COUPLE OF PLATES AN OVEN TRAY AND SOME MISCELLANEOUS WEIGHTS 
TWO PLATES 
THE WEIGHT WILL FORCE ALL THE MOISTURE OUT OF THE SALMON 
NOW JUST LEAVE THAT ON THE ICE FOR ABOUT FIVE DAYS 
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO FOR FIVE DAYS 
OH WE'RE GOING TO THINK OF EVERYTHING SWEDISH 
OF ABBA AND AGNETHA 
YOU CAN DANCE 
YOU CAN JIVE 
HAVING THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE 
SEE THAT GIRL 
WATCH THAT SCENE 
DIGGING THE DANCING QUEEN 
FRIDAY NIGHT

WE'RE ALSO HEADING FOR THE NORTH SHIELDS FISH QUAY 
THE FISHING TRAWLERS HAVE JUST COME IN WITH THEIR CATCH AND WE'RE HOPING TO PICK UP SOMETHING NICE AND FRESH 
THERE'S A FUNNY KIND OF HIERARCHY HERE 
THERE'S A POSH FISHMONGER IN HIS WHITE TRILBY BUYING THE TURBOT FOR ONE HUNDRED FOR THE LADIES THAT LUNCH 
THEN YOU'VE GOT THE LADS FROM THE CHIP SHOPS AND THEY'RE BUYING BIG BOXES OF FISH FOR A TENNER 
I CAN'T GET INTO MY HEAD THERE'S LADS RISKING THEIR LIVES IN THE NORTH SEA 
FOR BOXES OF FISH THAT ARE GOING FOR LIKE TWENTY

WHEY AYE MAN NOW DO YOU FANCY AN ELECTRIC DRILL AND A BIT OF DIY MAN AFTER 
WILL YOU SHUT UP OH I'VE GONE ALL GEORDIE NOW 
SHUT UP WE ARE GOING TO COOK THE ULTIMATE FISH PIE 
EVERYBODY LOVES A FISH PIE AND OURS IS A CRACKER 
STEP ONE IN THE PERFECT FISH PIE IS PERFECT POTATOES 
SO WE'RE USING CARROLL'S HERITAGE POTATOES 
REMEMBER LUCY AND ANTHONY THE ARISTOCRATS OF THE SPUD WORLD 
SHUT UP 
STEP ONE IS TO DRAIN THE POTATOES IN THE SINK 
WELL WE DON'T HAVE A SINK SO WE'RE GOING TO THE RIVER 
IT'S MAKING ME WANT TO GO 
IT'S NOT MAKING ME WANT TO WATCH 
WE NEED TO MASH THIS WITH SAID POTATO MASHER 
AND ADD A BIG KNOB OF BUTTER AND SOME GRUYERE CHEESE 
GRUYERE IS A GOOD CHEESE FOR THIS BECAUSE IT'S NOT TOO SWEET 
AND THERE'S A TEXTURE TO GRUYERE THAT'S QUITE NICE IT'S KIND OF SPRINGY AND CHEWY 
RIGHT THIS IS CALLED LOW IMPACT MASHING AEROBICS 
AND YOU CONTINUE TO DO THIS UNTIL THERE'S NOT A LUMP IN SIGHT 
SHALL WE BE DEAD SPOILT AND HAVE A DROP OF CREAM IN THERE AS WELL 
OH MIGHT AS WELL 
NOW ONCE THIS IS MASHED I'M GOING TO SET THAT ASIDE LET IT COOL 
I'M GOING TO GET ON AND SKIN THE FISH AND DAVE'S GOING TO GET ON WITH THE BROTH THAT WE POACH THE FISH IN 
I'VE GOT A LITRE OF FISH STOCK 
A CHOPPED ONION 
SOME CHOPPED FENNEL THAT JUST GIVES IT A VERY LIGHT ANISEED FLAVOUR 
A SMALL CHOPPED CARROT AND HALF A STICK OF CELERY AND A PINCH OF SAFFRON 
THIS WILL GIVE THE EVENTUAL WHITE SAUCE A GOLDEN TINT TAKE OFF ANY GREYNESS THE SECRET INGREDIENT 
A GOOD SLUG OF DRY VERMOUTH 
BIT LIKE A WHITE WINE SAUCE BUT VERMOUTH JUST GIVES IT THAT BIT OF J. E. N. E. SAIS QUOI 
O. K. 
HERE WE ARE 
VERY NICELY DONE MR. KING LOOK AT THAT JUST GAZE IN AMAZEMENT AT MR. KING'S PLATTER 
AND FOR THE ULTIMATE FISH PIE WE'VE GOT SOME CODLING SOME BLOCK HADDOCK THAT'S BABY HADDOCK 
SOME FINE RAW KING PRAWNS 
SOME SMOKED HADDOCK 
WE USE ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE QUANTITY OF SMOKED FISH TO THE TOTAL 
IT GIVES A NICE SMOKY FLAVOUR 
A LOVELY FINE PIECE OF SALMON 
A SEA BASS FILLET AND A MONKFISH TAIL 
WE'RE GOING TO POACH THE FISH 
EN VAPOUR AS THE FRENCH WOULD SAY 
AND JUST LAY THAT WITH LOVE 
INTO THAT LOVELY LOVELY BROTH 
WE POACH THE FISH FOR THREE TO FOUR MINUTES AND IT'S READY TO COME OUT LOOK AT THIS 
PERFECT THAT'S PERFECTLY COOKED 
THAT'S JUST FLAKING ON ITS OWN 
NOW I NEED TO STRAIN THAT STOCK 
WE'VE DONE WITH THAT VEG 
ALL THE GOODNESS HAS BEEN EXTRACTED WE'VE NO FURTHER USE FOR IT 
THIS FORMS THE BASIS OF THE SAUCE FOR THE FISH PIE 
SO WE RETURN THAT TO THE PAN AND WE'RE GOING TO BOIL IT AWAY AND REDUCE IT BY HALF 
AND NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS FLAKE THE FISH 
IT SHOULD JUST FLAKE QUITE NATURALLY AND JUST LAYER IT 
WHILE I'M DOING THAT DAVE'S GOING TO MAKE THE SAUCE 
SOME BUTTER IN THE PAN 
LET THAT MELT TO THE MELTED BUTTER I NOW ADD FLOUR 
WE START TO ADD THE STOCK 
WHOLE MILK THIS IS 
YES 
THAT'S SMOOTH 
SMOOTHER THAN A SINGLE FROM SADE 
NOW CONTINUE STIRRING AND LET THIS COOK FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO COOK OUT THE FLOUR 
WE'RE GOING TO BLANCHE SOME SPINACH BECAUSE WE LIKE SPINACH IN OUR FISH PIE 
PUT A DASH OF WATER IN 
PUT THE SPINACH IN 
PUT THE LID BACK ON AND WAIT FOR IT TO WILT HOW SIMPLE CAN THAT BE 
WHILE HE'S WILTING I'VE FINISHED THE SAUCE 
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A GOOD PARSLEY SAUCE 
WE CAN GET THIS ON THE PIE MATE LOVELY JOB'S A GOOD UN 
LOOK AT THE COLOUR OF THAT YOU SEE THE SAFFRON HAS JUST GIVEN IT A HUE WITH THE GREEN 
THAT WILL BE A HUE Y. GREEN 
HARD BOILED EGGS I HAVE THIS THEORY THAT WHEN GOD MADE EGGS HE PUT TOO MUCH WHITE IN THEM 
A TOP TIP WHILST SLICING EGGS IF YOU WET YOUR KNIFE THEY SLICE BETTER 
NOW THAT LOOKS PRETTY WILTED TO ME WILTED TO THE POINT OF APATHY 
IT'LL NEVER GET OUT OF BED THAT ONE 
NOW WE JUST ADD A FEW FRONDS OVER THE EGGS 
NOW THE TATTIES DON'T FORGET THIS IS COLD POTATO 
WE SET IT ASIDE EARLIER SO IT WENT NICE AND COLD 
BECAUSE WHAT WE DIDN'T WANT IT TO DO WAS LET ALL THE POTATO SINK INTO THE FISH PIE 
ARRANGE IN A RUSTIC FASHION 
WHICH IS ALWAYS GOOD SEEING AS I'M PUTTING IT ON THE PLATE 
IT'S NICE BECAUSE ALL THOSE CRESTED TOPS ARE GOING TO GO CRUNCHY 
AND IF YOU'RE SKINT AND CAN'T AFFORD MUCH FISH JUST PUT MORE POTATO ON AND NO ONE WILL NOTICE 
THAT'S IT NOW FOR A FINAL FLOURISH CIABATTA CRUMBS 
IN ADDITION TO THAT SOME PARMESAN CHEESE 
MIX THAT TOGETHER AND WE GET SUPER CRUSTY CRISPY CRUMBS 
STICK THAT IN THE OVEN MEDIUM ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR 
EH VOILA 
WHILE MR. KING IS CHOPPING LIKE KEITH RICHARDS AT A PARTY I'M PREPARING A MUCH UNDER RATED VEGETABLE 
FROZEN BROAD BEANS 
WE'RE GONNA SAUTE SOME PANCETTA SOME SMOKY BACON AND SOME SHALLOTS IN SOME OLIVE OIL 
AND THEN FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES JUST ROLL THESE BROAD BEANS INTO THAT 
AND THOSE BEANS ARE JUST GOING TO WARM THROUGH WITH THAT LOVELY BACON FAT 
THE BEANS ARE DONE I'M JUST REHEATING THE LEFTOVER SAUCE 
SO I'VE GOT A NICE PARSLEY POURING SAUCE FOR THE PIE AND THE BEANS TIME TO GET THE PIE OUT I THINK 
I THINK THAT'S US 
OH YES 
PLEASE DON'T DROP IT DON'T DROP IT 
THAT WOULD NOT BE GOOD HERE WE GO TIME TO SERVE UP

NO NORTHERN ADVENTURE WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT PAYING HOMAGE TO THE ULTIMATE SYMBOL FOR US NORTHERNERS 
IT'S THE ANGEL OF THE NORTH SCULPTED BY ANTONY GORMLEY 
AND IS A TRIBUTE TO ALL THOSE MINERS WHO WORKED DIRECTLY BELOW IT 
THE MOST PUBLICLY VIEWED PIECE OF ART IN THE WORLD 
NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY VIEW IT AND APPARENTLY THE ANGEL OF THE NORTH'S BODY WAS ANTONY GORMLEY'S 
HE COVERED HIMSELF WITH CLINGFILM 
AND THEN TOOK A MOULD AND THAT'S HIS BODY 
HE'S A THIN LAD ISN'T HE 
YOU DID THAT BEFORE YOUR WEDDING COVERED YOURSELF IN CLINGFILM 
SAT IN A SAUNA TRYING TO GET INTO YOUR WEDDING SUIT 
BOIL IN THE BAG 
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER LONG TRIP HASN'T IT IT HAS AN ALL 
THOUGHT IT WAS A SIMPLE RETURN HOME LIKE EVERYTHING WE EVER DO NOT 
WE FOUND THIS INCREDIBLE KIND OF LARDER IN THE NORTH 
INCREDIBLE PROLIFERATION OF PRODUCTS BUT PEOPLE ARE SEIZING IT AREN'T THEY 
OH THEY ARE AND THERE'S SUCH A HUGE AMOUNT OF LOVE AND CARE TAKEN IN THE PRODUCE 
THERE'S A RENAISSANCE IN BRITISH FOOD 
YOU'VE GOT ALL YOUR FANCY FARMERS' MARKETS 
BUT I THINK BURY MARKET ENCOMPASSED THAT OPTIMISM AND KNOWLEDGE 
IT WAS THE WORKING MAN THAT WAS SHOPPING THERE WELL EVERYBODY WAS SHOPPING THERE EXACTLY 
SO THAT'S IT THEN FROM WEST TO EAST IT'S AN HONOURABLE DRAW 
I STILL SAY OUR PIES ARE BETTER 
NOW DON'T START OR I'LL HAVE TO BRING UP NEWCASTLE'S CORNUCOPIA OF FISHY GORGEOUSNESS 
WE'VE GOT FISH IN BARROW TOO MATE THOSE POTATOES WERE LOVELY MAN AH YOU'RE CLUTCHING AT STRAWS NOW
