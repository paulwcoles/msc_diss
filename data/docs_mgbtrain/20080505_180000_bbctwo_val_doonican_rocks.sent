THERE ARE NOT MANY SINGERS YOU CAN IDENTIFY BY THEIR PROPS 
A ROCKING CHAIR AND A JUMPER 
VAL DOONICAN 
VAL DOONICAN IS IT YEAH 
VAL DOONICAN VAL DOONICAN RIGHT AWAY 
ROCKING CHAIR JUMPERS 
THE USUAL ONES 
WE DO HAVE TO BUY JUMPERS FOR DAD NOW 
HE HAS RAFFLED THEM ALL OFF FOR CHARITY 
SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE SONGS 
VAL DOONICAN IS THE EXCEPTION 
FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS HE SPENT SO MANY SATURDAY NIGHTS IN OUR HOMES 
HE WAS VIRTUALLY PART OF THE FAMILY 
BUT SHARE A FEW MOMENTS WITH YOU 
I'M EIGHTY NOW AND I CAN'T BELIEVE MY LUCK REALLY 
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS NOW SINCE NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN 
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN OUT OF WORK 
AND I'VE BEEN DOING WHAT I WANTED ALL THE TIME 
WHETHER I WAS ON AT THE PALLADIUM 
OR WHETHER I WAS UP IN BLACKPOOL DOING A SEASON WITH ALL MY MATES 
PLAYING GOLF AND HAVING A LOVELY TIME 
AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF WHAT A WAY TO MAKE A LIVING IT'S AMAZING 
SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS 
SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS 
ARE SONGS 
VAL DOONICAN WAS INCREDIBLY POPULAR 
DURING THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES OVER NINETEEN MILLION VIEWERS 
REGULARLY MADE A DATE WITH DOONICAN 
THE NEAREST YOU GET NOW IS THE STRICTLY COME DANCING THING 
WHERE YOU'LL ALL SIT AROUND AND WATCH 
PEOPLE ARE REMINDED OF THAT AND GENERALLY IT'S A GOOD MEMORY 
IT WAS WONDERFUL 
HE WAS EITHER THEIR FATHER OR THEIR UNCLE 
OR THEIR BROTHER OR SOMEBODY THEY WISHED THEY HAD IN THE FAMILY 
I PEEKED IN TO SAY GOODNIGHT 
AND THERE I SAW 
MY CHILD IN PRAYER 
AND FOR ME 
SOME SCARLET RIBBONS 
SCARLET RIBBONS 
FOR MY 
THROUGH HIS WEEKLY SHOW 
WE SOMEHOW FELT WE GOT TO KNOW THE MAN BEHIND THE PERSONALITY 
HE WAS VERY GOOD AT THE IRISH TALE 
HE HAD THAT TOUCH OF WHIMSY ABOUT HIM 
AND OF COURSE HE LOVED TELLING STORIES ABOUT HIS FAMILY IN IRELAND 
I THINK HE CAUGHT THE IMAGINATION OF PEOPLE AT HOME 
A WOMAN SAID TO ME ARE YOU VAL DOONICAN ON THE RADIO 
AND I SAID YEAH ARE YOU SURE SHE SAID 
I SAID POSITIVE ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE 
ISN'T THAT FUNNY SHE SAID YOU SOUND FAT WITH BLACK CURLY HAIR 
IT WAS HERE IN WATERFORD IN IRELAND 
THAT MICHAEL VALENTINE DOONICAN WAS BORN IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN 
THE YOUNGEST OF EIGHT 
THEY WERE A HAPPY BUNCH ALTHOUGH THERE WASN'T MUCH MONEY 
AND BOTH HIS SISTER MARY AND HIS FATHER DIED BEFORE HE REACHED FIFTEEN 
FROM AN EARLY AGE MUSIC WAS A CORNERSTONE 
ALL OF US IN OUR FAMILY WERE INVOLVED IN LOCAL MUSICAL THINGS 
ALL THE TIME 
AND THEREFORE AT A VERY EARLY STAGE OF MY LIFE 
I WAS ABLE TO GET A FEW PEOPLE ROUND ME 
AND WORK OUT THE HARMONIES SO WE COULD SING SONGS 
LIKE WE HEARD IN THE MOVIES YOU KNOW IN THE COWBOY FILMS 
AND I LEARNED TO PUT THESE THINGS TOGETHER STRICTLY BY INSTINCT 
YOU SING THIS YOU SING THAT PUT THEM TOGETHER THAT'LL SOUND ALL RIGHT 
AND IN THOSE DAYS AND IT'S PROBABLY STILL THE SAME 
NEARLY EVERY STREET IN THE COUNTRY HAD ITS TALENT 
THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME SINGER OR DANCER OR COMEDIAN OR WHATEVER 
I THINK DEEP DOWN ALL THE IRISH WERE TALENTED 
I'M BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN 
MY BROTHER PLAYED THE MANDOLIN I PLAYED THE MANDOLIN 
MY UNCLE PLAYED THE MANDOLIN QUITE WELL 
AND A COUSIN OF MINE PLAYED IT 
WE USED TO GET TOGETHER IN THE FRONT PARLOUR THE OLD FASHIONED FRONT PARLOUR THING 
AND ONCE AGAIN WE WOULD WORK OUT THE SAME AS I DID WITH THE VOCAL THING 
YOU PLAY THAT THEN YOU PLAY THAT I'LL PLAY A LITTLE CHORD 
SO WE USED TO HAVE THESE LITTLE MANDOLIN RECITALS 
WHEN I USED TO BE A LITTLE KID I USED TO GO 
EVERY SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO THE PICTURE SHOW 
CLOSE UP TO THE SCREEN MY LIFE WAS SO SERENE 
I LIVED THROUGH EVERY SCENE WITH MY MOVIE QUEEN 
BETTY GRABLE 
FROM THE SATURDAY AFTERNOON PICTURE SHOWS CAME A LOVE OF COWBOY SONGS 
AMERICAN FILM STARS AND JAZZ 
I DISCOVERED THAT DJANGO REINHARDT 
IN SPITE OF BEING THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE JAZZ GUITARIST 
HE HAD LIGHTNING HANDS 
THAT HIS LEFT HAND WAS BADLY DAMAGED 
AND HE COULD ONLY REALLY USE THE FIRST TWO FINGERS 
AND I CAN REMEMBER ONE NIGHT PLAYING HIS RECORDS OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH ME WIND UP GRAMOPHONE 
AND ME DAD WAS DOWN THE PUB AND ME DAD CAME IN AND I SAID 
DAD LISTEN TO THIS FELLA HE'S FANTASTIC 
DO YOU REALISE HE CAN ONLY USE TWO FINGERS ON HIS LEFT HAND 
AND ME FATHER SAID AH WELL HAVING LISTENED TO HIM HE ONLY NEEDS THE ONE 
VAL'S DAD PREFERRED A MORE TRADITIONAL IRISH SOUND 
THERE WAS A FAMOUS DISTINGUISHED IRISH TENOR IN THE OLD DAYS 
CALLED COUNT JOHN MCCORMACK 
AND MY DAD LOVED HIM 
THERE'S A PECULIAR TYPE OF VOICE THAT IRISH PEOPLE LIKE 
IT PROBABLY STARTED WITH PEOPLE LIKE JOHN MCCORMACK 
IT'S A TENOR VOICE IT'S A LITTLE HIGH THERE'S A VIBRATO 
HIS BIG IMPACT UPON IRISH CONSCIOUSNESS WAS NINETEEN THIRTY TWO 
HE SANG FOR THE POPE HE SANG PANUS ANGELICUS 
AND THIS BECAME A STRONG ICON OF IRISH CONTEMPORARY CULTURE 
COS IRELAND ITSELF HAD ONLY ACHIEVED PARTIAL INDEPENDENCE IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO 
SO IT WAS STILL IN SEARCH OF AN IDENTITY TO SOME EXTENT 
THEN WHEN PEOPLE LIKE BING CROSBY CAME ALONG 
ME FATHER JUST THOUGHT HE COULDN'T SING AT ALL 
HE THOUGHT HE WAS RUBBISH AND I HAD THE PLEASURE OF TELLING BING CROSBY 
WHEN I HAD THE JOY OF MEETING HIM LATER ON 
WE PLAYED GOLF TOGETHER AND I TOLD HIM ABOUT ME DAD 
AND HE SAID I'M SURE MY DAD WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME 
OH GIVE ME LAND 
ALTHOUGH VAL ONLY KNEW HIS FATHER FOR A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME 
HE HAD A LASTING INFLUENCE ON HIM 
I WENT TO SAY GOODBYE TO HIM AND HE SAID SIT DOWN FOR A SECOND 
AND HE SAID SOMETHING TO ME THAT HAS STAYED WITH ME ALL MY LIFE 
AND THAT IS HE SAID BEFORE YOU GO I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING 
HE SAID YOU THINK I'M TERRIFIC DON'T YOU 
AND I DID I THOUGHT HE WAS WONDERFUL 
I SAID I DO WELL BEFORE I GO HE SAID 
I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR TO TELL YOU THAT I'M NOT 
BECAUSE WHEN I'M GONE HE SAID A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TELL YOU THAT I WAS NO GOOD 
AND NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME MORE THAN FOR YOU TO SAY YES HE TOLD ME THAT HIMSELF 
AND I THINK THAT PUT A LITTLE MESSAGE INTO ME 
DON'T EVER PRETEND YOU'RE ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE NOT 
VAL TOOK HIS FATHER'S ADVICE TO HEART 
AND BUILT A CAREER ON BEING HIMSELF 
TRAILER FOR SALE OR RENT 
ROOM TO LET FIFTY CENTS 
NO PHONE NO POOL NO PETS 
I AIN'T GOT NO CIGARETTES 
AH BUT TWO HOURS OF PUSHING BROOM 
BUYS AN EIGHT BY TWELVE FOUR BIT ROOM 
I'M A MAN OF MEANS BY NO MEANS 
KING OF THE ROAD 
MY FATHER SAID SOMETHING AGAIN 
IN THE EARLY DAYS IF YOU WENT ON STAGE AND DID SOMETHING 
HE SAID THAT'LL WORK OUT AS LONG AS THEY LIKE THE LOOK OF YOU 
AND THAT'S WHAT SHOWBUSINESS IS ABOUT REALLY 
AS LONG AS THEY LIKE THE LOOK OF YOU YOU'RE ALL RIGHT 
TRAILER FOR SALE OR RENT 
ROOM TO LET FIFTY CENTS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ADVICE FROM THEIR PARENTS OR FROM THEIR FATHERS 
BUT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY TAKE NOTICE OF IT 
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING INTERNAL 
THAT RESPONDS TO GOOD ADVICE 
AND CERTAINLY IN HIS CASE 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT APPLIED TO ALL HIS LIFE EXPERIENCES 
BEFORE HE STARTED DOING THE SHOW KING OF THE ROAD 
VAL LOST HIS FATHER AND A SISTER WHEN HE WAS STILL A CHILD 
LATER A BROTHER DIED WHEN HE WAS IN HIS TWENTIES 
HE KNEW THE MEANING OF LOSS KING OF THE ROAD 
HE COMES FROM A GENERATION THAT IN IRELAND IN THE THIRTIES AND FORTIES 
ESPECIALLY WAS RIFE WITH TUBERCULOSIS AND CONSUMPTION 
AND THERE WAS A HIGH MORTALITY RATE 
AND DEATH WAS A MUCH MORE 
PARADOXICALLY SPEAKING A MUCH MORE ALIVE PROSPECT 
THAN IT IS NOW OR THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN BRITAIN 
WHEN HE MOVED HERE IN THE FIFTIES 
SO YEAH THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF ESCAPE 
AN ELEMENT OF WELL LOOK WHAT I'VE LEFT BEHIND 
I REALLY NEED TO EMPHASISE THE POSITIVE 
AND ELIMINATE THE NEGATIVE 
THE SUMMERS DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY USED TO BE 
WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING FOR ME TO DO 
IN MY HOME TOWN IN WATERFORD THERE WAS NO JOBS ABOUT 
THAT WAS THE ONLY THING I COULD DO 
IT WASN'T AS IF I COULD GO INTO ON A PROJECT OR SOMETHING 
AND SAY IF THIS DOESN'T WORK I'LL GO BACK TO BEING A SURGEON 
OR AN ESTATE AGENT OR ANYTHING 
I JUST COULDN'T GET A JOB IN A FACTORY EVEN AT THAT TIME 
THERE WAS NOTHING SO I JUST WENT AND DID WHAT WAS AVAILABLE TO ME 
BY THE TIME HE WAS TWENTY VAL WAS A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN 
WITH A REGULAR GIG IN COUNTY WICKLOW 
I WENT TO THE LITTLE VILLAGE 
WHERE I DID MY FIRST EVER SUMMER SEASON BACK IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN 
WHERE I GOT THE FIVE A WEEK 
AND I LOOKED AT THE HOTEL BECAUSE THEY GAVE ME FIVE A WEEK 
AND I GOT MY LUNCH IN THE HOTEL WITH THE STAFF 
AND A LITTLE ROOM TO SLEEP IN 
TALK ABOUT REFLECTIONS 
AT THAT TIME IF SOMEBODY HAD TOLD ME WHAT WAS AHEAD OF ME 
I JUST WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IT 
THE ROAD TO SUCCESS WAS A LONG ONE BUT VAL HAD STAYING POWER 
I MET HIM AT A ONE NIGHT STAND 
HE JUST WATCHED ME AND HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD 
SO I SAID TO HIM DO YOU THINK I'M GONNA MAKE THE GRADE 
AND HE SAID WELL FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD 
I THINK YOU'VE JUST ABOUT REACHED THE STAGE NOW HE SAID 
WHERE YOU'RE CHANGING FROM SECOND UP INTO THIRD 
BUT YOU'LL NEVER MAKE THE CHARTS 
I WAS PLAYING WITH ONE OF THESE TRAVELLING ROADSHOWS 
IN THE HOTEL ACROSS THE ROAD 
NIPPED OVER ONE AFTERNOON FOR A DRINK 
AND I HEARD THE GUITAR PLAYING 
AND CURIOSITY BROUGHT ME INTO THE BAR ROOM 
AND THERE WAS VAL SITTING PRACTISING 
WHICH I DISCOVERED HE DID EVERY DAY IN THE WEEK 
A DETERMINED TYPE OF GUY 
THE FIRST THING I THINK YOU SHOULD DO HE SAID 
IS TO CHANGE YOUR NAME TO SOMETHING LIKE P. J. RINGO OR PAUL 
AND FROM NOW ON TELL PEOPLE YOU COME FROM LIVERPOOL 
DON'T SAY THAT YOU COME FROM DONEGAL 
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WALK TALL WITH A NAME LIKE VAL 
AS A MATTER OF FACT I DON'T THINK YOU'LL WALK AT ALL 
AND YOU'LL NEVER MAKE THE CHARTS 
VAL TAUGHT HIMSELF TO PLAY THE GUITAR 
HE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT IT 
AND CELEBRATED IT ON EVERY SHOW 
THIS OLD GUITAR 
TAUGHT ME TO SING A LOVE SONG 
SHOWED ME HOW TO LAUGH AND HOW TO CRY 
INTRODUCED ME TO SOME FRIENDS OF MINE 
AND BRIGHTENED UP MY DAYS 
HELPED ME MAKE IT THROUGH SOME LONELY NIGHTS 
WHAT A FRIEND TO HAVE ON A COLD AND LONELY NIGHT 
HE WAS ALWAYS IN AWE IF WE HAD FANTASTIC GUITAR PLAYERS ON THE SHOW 
LIKE JOHN WILLIAMS 
WHO WAS ALSO VERY VERSATILE 
WHEN HE PLAYED WITH SKY 
HE WOULD PLAY YOU KNOW QUITE A DIFFERENT FORM OF MUSIC 
HE WAS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT OTHER GUITAR PLAYERS 
NOT JUST MYSELF OTHER GUITAR PLAYERS IN DIFFERENT STYLES HE'D HAD ON 
AND HE WAS KNOCKED OUT WITH THEM 
AND HE'D TALK WITH ENTHUSIASM ABOUT IT 
IF HE COULD DO A LITTLE NUMBER WITH THEM THERE WOULD BE TWO REASONS 
QUITE SELFISHLY HE WANTED THE OPPORTUNITY OF PLAYING WITH THEM 
WHICH WAS LOVELY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO DO 
AND HE WAS AWARE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THAT'S HOW PEOPLE WOULD RELATE TO THOSE GUESTS 
THROUGH HIM 
HE REALLY USED TO LIKE THOSE LITTLE BITS THAT HE DID WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
AND HE USED TO LEARN THEM YOU KNOW 
VAL HAD REAL MUSICAL ABILITY 
AND THE GUITAR WASN'T THE ONLY INSTRUMENT HE COULD PLAY 
I WENT AND PLAYED A DANCE FLOOR ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS A DRUMMER 
WAY WAY BACK AND WE GOT TO THIS LITTLE PLACE 
AND WHEN WE STARTED TO SET UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DANCE HALL FLOOR 
THERE WAS A FEW KITCHEN CHAIRS 
AND ALL THE PREPARATIONS WENT ON FOR THE DANCE AND NOBODY MOVED THEM 
AND EVERYBODY GOT UP AND DANCED THEY STILL LEFT THE CHAIRS THERE 
I WAS SURE SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO FALL OVER THEM 
I SAID TO THE BAND LEADER WILL I MOVE THOSE HE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE FOR 
EVENTUALLY WHEN THERE WAS A BREAK IN THE DANCING I WENT AND MOVED THESE TWO CHAIRS 
AND EVERYBODY GOT UP TO DANCE AND THERE WAS A CRASH 
AND ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE WENT STRAIGHT DOWN THROUGH THE FLOOR 
THEY DID SOME HARD WORK THOSE GUYS 
THAT'S ONE PART OF THE BUSINESS I WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO BANDS 
THESE GUYS WOULD ARRIVE AT A PARTICULAR PLACE 
AND LIKE YOUR OWN MEN THEY HAVE TO PUT UP ALL THE INSTRUMENTS 
RIG UP THE SOUND BLAH BLAH BLAH 
DO THE SHOW DO THE DANCE MAYBE TWO OR THREE HOURS 
AND ANOTHER HALF HOUR OR MORE TAKING ALL THE STUFF DOWN AGAIN 
WE WENT IN AND DID OUR LITTLE BIT ON THE STAGE AND THAT'S US FINISHED 
THE BAND BOYS HAD IT TOUGH 
THE END OF THE FORTIES ME AND A COUPLE OF MATES OF MINE 
WE HAD THIS LITTLE TRIO IN DUBLIN 
AND I GOT MY FIRST EVER RADIO SERIES 
AND THAT SET ME UP ON SOMETHING I'D NEVER DONE BEFORE 
SO THAT WAS ANOTHER STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
VAL'S ABILITY TO WRITE AND ARRANGE MUSIC 
ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A GROUP CALLED THE FOUR RAMBLERS 
THEY WERE ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN ENGLAND 
AND LOOKING FOR A NEW MEMBER 
MOST OF THE IRISH ENTERTAINERS IN THOSE DAYS WERE SEMI PROS 
THEY HAD JOBS DURING THE DAY 
AND I SUPPOSE A LOT OF THEM WERE A BIT TOO NERVOUS AS IT WERE 
TO GIVE UP WHAT WAS A PERMANENT JOB ON CHANCE 
BUT THEN AS THE YEARS PROGRESSED 
THEY BECAME A LITTLE MORE AMBITIOUS A LITTLE MORE DARING 
AND OFF THEY WENT AND AS YOU KNOW A LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN VERY VERY VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL 
ALTHOUGH THE GROUP WERE POPULAR MONEY WAS TIGHT 
AND PUBLICITY FOR THE NEW ARRIVAL 
INVOLVED STICKING VAL'S HEAD ON TO A PREVIOUS MEMBER'S BODY 
FROM NINETEEN FIFTY TO NINETEEN ALMOST NINETEEN SIXTY 
WE DID A TOUR OF THE MUSIC HALLS 
DOING TWELVE SHOWS A WEEK IN DIFFERENT TOWNS 
WE HAD NO CARS WE JUST TRAVELLED BY TRAIN 
WE WERE LIKE GYPSIES REALLY 
SOMETIMES YOU DIDN'T EAT FOR GOD'S SAKE FOR NEARLY TWO DAYS 
WE NEVER WENT TO A RESTAURANT IT WAS HORRIBLE 
WE COULDN'T GO IN LIKE THEY DO TODAY 
AND INSIST THAT THERE'S TWENTY BOTTLES OF DRINK IN YOUR BEDROOM 
AND TWO JARS OF COFFEE AND ALL THAT THERE WAS NONE OF THAT CARRY ON 
MY GOODNESS WHAT A SHOP FLOOR THAT IS TO LEARN YOUR JOB IN OUR BUSINESS 
BECAUSE NOBODY IS SPOILING YOU AND TELLING YOU LIES ABOUT HOW GOOD YOU ARE 
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO PROVE IT ALL YOURSELF 
TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT STUFF 
TAKE ALL THE KNOCKS AND TAKE ALL THE KNOCK BACKS 
AND STILL RETAIN HUMANITY 
STILL RETAIN THE ABILITY TO LAUGH AND BE ABLE TO SEE THE FUNNY SIDE 
AND BE ABLE TO BECOME A BETTER PERFORMER 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY WHEN HE WAS TWENTY THREE 
VAL MOVED TO ENGLAND WITH THE FOUR RAMBLERS 
HE WAS JUST ONE OF A HUGE NUMBER OF IRISH MEN AND WOMEN 
WHO MIGRATED IN SEARCH OF WORK AT THIS TIME 
PEOPLE COULDN'T GET WORK OR THE WORK THEY DID HAVE WAS DRYING UP 
ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS SO A LOT OF THEM FETCHED UP IN LONDON 
AND THAT'S WHEN WE FIND THE GREAT IRISH ENCLAVES IN LONDON EMERGING 
MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WENT TO MANCHESTER BIRMINGHAM LONDON 
FROM IRELAND WHO EMIGRATED 
WORKING THE ROADS CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND SO ON 
WERE FROM RURAL AREAS 
THEY HAD NO CONCEPT OF CITY LIVING 
THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO LIVE IN CITIES OR RELATE TO CITY PEOPLE 
THEREFORE THEY CAME ACROSS AS IGNORANT AND UNCULTURED 
WHICH IN A WAY THEY WERE 
THEY WEREN'T CITY PEOPLE 
AND THEY CAME ACROSS AS SLOW WITTED AND I SUPPOSE PROBABLY THICK 
VAL MAY HAVE BEEN SHIELDED FROM THAT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT 
IF HE'S MOVING IN SHOWBIZ CIRCLES 
AND ALSO IF HE'S THAT DRIVEN IF HE'S SORT OF MADE UP HIS MIND 
THAT HE WANTS TO PURSUE THIS 
BUT WHERE IS MY QUIET GIRL 
WHERE IS MY GENTLE GIRL 
WHERE IS MY SPECIAL GIRL 
WHO IS SOFT SOFT AS SNOW 
MUSIC WAS VAL'S FIRST LOVE 
HIS ONLY LOVE REALLY 
UNTIL HE MET LYNNETTE RAE HERSELF AN ESTABLISHED ENTERTAINER 
I WAS ONE OF THE STARS IN THE TONY NEWLEY SHOW 
THERE WAS TONY NEWLEY LYNNETTE RAE 
AND THE FOUR RAMBLERS PLUS OTHERS 
AND I WOULD GO ACROSS AND YOU WON'T ANY OF YOU REMEMBER THIS TO THE MOO COW MILK BAR 
IN MANCHESTER OR LIVERPOOL OR BIRMINGHAM AND BRING HIM BACK A CUP OF COFFEE 
BECAUSE HE WOULD BE SITTING IN THE DRESSING ROOM WRITING MUSIC FOR THE NEXT SHOW 
AND SO I WOULD BE TROTTING ACROSS AND KNOCK ON THE DOOR 
AND SAY I'VE BROUGHT YOU A CUP OF COFFEE AND HE'D SAY OH THANKS LOVE 
I'M GONNA MARRY IN THE FALL 
I THINK EVENTUALLY I ASKED HIM WHY DON'T WE GET MARRIED 
I DON'T THINK HE ACTUALLY ASKED ME 
IN FACT I'M SURE OF IT 
IS IT NOT TRUE THAT I INTRODUCED YOU TO YOUR LOVELY LADY YOU DID 
INTRODUCED ME TO MY WIFE 
ACTUALLY I DIDN'T INTEND YOU TO MARRY HER 
I JUST WANTED YOU TO MEET HER I KNOW DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WORKED OUT 
IT WAS TONY'S BIRTHDAY DURING THAT FIRST WEEK 
AND HE TOOK EVERYBODY OUT TO DINNER 
BUT HE THEN MADE A STIPULATION THAT EVERYBODY IN THE SHOW 
HAD TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY DIDN'T NORMALLY DO 
AND VAL SAT ON A STOOL AND PLAYED FROGGY WENT A COURTING AND HE DID RIDE UH HUH 
AND TONY NEWLEY SAID TO HIM THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO 
I FELT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HE WAS WITH A GROUP CALLED THE RAMBLERS THAT'S RIGHT 
BUT YOU HAD SUCH A SINGULAR TALENT AND SUCH WARMTH 
I THOUGHT ONE DAY THAT LAD WILL PROBABLY BE ON HIS OWN YOU KNOW 
I'M STILL TRYING 
IT WAS ALL THE ENCOURAGEMENT VAL NEEDED 
AND HE WENT FROM BEING ONE OF THE FOUR RAMBLERS 
TO BEING VAL DOONICAN 
POP GOES THE WEASEL 
UP AND DOWN THE CITY ROADS 
IN AND OUT OF THE EAGLE 
THAT'S THE WAY THE MONEY GOES 
POP GOES THE WEASEL 
POP POP POP GOES THE WEASEL 
I WROTE TO THE BOSS OF THE B. B. C. AND I'D LOVE TO TRY IT ON MY OWN 
SO IF THERE'S EVER ANY BROADCASTS GOING FOR A SOLO ARTIST 
I'D LOVE TO DO IT AND TO MY AMAZEMENT HE WROTE BACK 
AND I DID AN AUDITION I SAT IN A STUDIO WITH A GUITAR 
AND SANG SOME SONGS WITH NOBODY THERE AT ALL 
THERE WAS JUST SOMEBODY ON THE OTHER END OF THE SOUND SYSTEM 
LISTENING TO ME IN THE STUDIO 
AND HE GAVE ME SOME BROADCASTS 
AND AFTER A WHILE I GOT MY OWN RADIO PROGRAMME 
ROLF HARRIS ALSO HAD A RADIO SHOW AT THAT TIME 
AND WAS IMPRESSED BY VAL 
I THINK HE HAD THE SECRET OF WHAT MAKES A GOOD BROADCASTER 
THE FACT THAT HE'S PUTTING ON NO AIRS AND GRACES 
HE'S NOT HOLDING HIMSELF UP AS A GREAT EXPERT ON ANYTHING 
HE'S JUST CHATTING TO TO SOMEBODY 
AND YOU ALWAYS FELT HE WAS TALKING TO ONE PERSON 
IT WAS REMARKABLE THE WAY HE CAME OUT OF THAT QUIET 
VERY SHY TYPE OF PERSON 
TO WHAT HE FINALLY FINISHED UP AS 
ALTHOUGH AT THE SAME TIME 
HE WAS NEVER ROBUST EVEN IN HIS SHOWS 
I MEAN HE SAT AND ANNOUNCED THE SONG AND WHAT HAVE YOU 
AND THAT WAS IT 
I PEEKED IN AND ON HER BED 
IN GAY PROFUSION LYING THERE 
PRIVATELY AND PROFESSIONALLY EVERYTHING WAS ON THE UP 
VAL AND LYNNE WERE ENJOYING THEIR NEW BABY SIOBHAN 
THEN HEARTBREAK 
AT JUST SEVEN MONTHS SIOBHAN WAS A VICTIM OF COT DEATH 
I WAS JUST TAKING OFF ON A ROAD TO SUCCESS THEN 
THINGS WERE HAPPENING I HAD MY OWN SORT OF RADIO SHOW 
AND I WAS YOU KNOW I WAS BEGINNING TO EARN MORE MONEY 
THAN I'D EVER THOUGHT I COULD EARN IN MY LIFE 
RELATIVELY SPEAKING 
AND THEREFORE WHEN THAT HAPPENED 
YOU WOULD GIVE EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD INSTEAD 
AND HAVE THE LITTLE ONE BACK 
YOU'D GIVE UP YOUR CAREER GIVE IT ALL BACK 
SAY I DON'T CARE ABOUT ALL THAT CAN WE HAVE HER BACK 
YOU KNOW AND THAT'S AGAIN ANOTHER LESSON THAT YOU LEARN I THINK 
I THINK IT'S 
I THINK A WOMAN I SHOULDN'T SAY THIS 
A WOMAN FEELS IT MORE THAN A MAN 
OF COURSE HE FELT IT DEEPLY BUT HE STILL HAD TO WORK 
I COULD LET THE EMOTION SHOW 
VAL WORKED HARDER THAN EVER 
THEN OUT OF THE BLUE IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR 
CAME AN OPPORTUNITY WHICH CHANGED HIS LIFE 
TRYING TO GET THAT BREAK TO GET ON TO SOMETHING NEW 
YOU HAVE TO SIT AROUND AND WAIT FOR IT 
THE MOST POPULAR SHOW ON TELEVISION AT THAT TIME LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT WISE 
WAS A THING CALLED SUNDAY NIGHT AT THE LONDON PALLADIUM 
IT WAS A HUGELY POPULAR SHOW 
AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT SHOWS OF ALL TIME 
VAL PARNELL CAME TO SEE ME 
I MEAN THAT WAS REALLY LIKE YOU KNOW 
MUHAMMAD ALI COMING TO SEE MY DAUGHTERS FIGHTING YOU KNOW 
SO HE CAME TO THE SHOW 
AND I THINK HE SAID WE'LL PUT YOU ON SUNDAY NIGHT AT THE LONDON PALLADIUM 
AND I NEARLY FELL OFF THE CHAIR 
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE MECCA OF LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT 
I REMEMBER TO THIS DAY I COULD SING YOU THE SONG 
I WILL SING YOU THE SONG 
SHE'S A GREAT BIG STRONG LUMP OF AN AGRICULTURAL IRISH GIRL 
SHE NEITHER PAINTS NOR POWDERS AND HER FIGURE IS ALL HER OWN 
BUT SHE COULD HIT THAT HARD OOH 
THE KICK OF A MULE YOU'D THINK YOU'D HAD 
BUT FULL OF YOUR ARMS WITH IRISH LOVE IS MARY A. N. N. MALONE 
PLING 
AND THE CROWD WENT ABSOLUTELY MAD 
YES I'M GONNA GET THERE SOMEHOW 
WITH A FRAULEIN ON MY KNEES 
IF I DON'T GET THERE TOMORROW 
COME LOOKIN' FOR ME PLEASE 
THAT'S WHEN I SAID IT TOOK ME SEVENTEEN YEARS TO BECOME AN OVERNIGHT SUCCESS 
I COULDN'T GET A RECORD CONTRACT TO SAVE MY LIFE BEFORE THAT 
BUT NOW AFTER THE PALLADIUM 
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE THINKING OH THIS GUY IS FANTASTIC 
I THINK THEY WERE THINKING I THINK THIS GUY'S GOING TO BE POPULAR 
WALK TALL WALK STRAIGHT AND LOOK THE WORLD RIGHT IN THE EYE 
HIS FIRST SINGLE RELEASED A FEW MONTHS LATER 
TOOK HIM STRAIGHT INTO THE TOP TEN 
BE A PROUD MAN AND HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH 
WALK TALL WALK STRAIGHT AND LOOK THE WORLD RIGHT IN THE EYE 
WHEN I WAS JUST A BOY MA TAUGHT THESE THINGS TO ME 
BUT I WAS YOUNG AND FOOLISH THEN AND MUCH TOO BLIND TO SEE 
I IGNORED THE THINGS SHE SAID AS IF I'D NEVER HEARD 
NOW I SEE AND UNDERSTAND THE WISDOM OF HER WORDS 
EVERYBODY'S TALKING AT ME 
I DON'T HEAR A WORD THEY'RE SAYIN' 
THE ONLY OTHER ACT FROM THE SOUTH OF IRELAND THAT WAS IN THE CHARTS 
WERE THE BACHELORS PEOPLE DIDN'T SEEM TO LIKE THE BACHELORS TOO MUCH 
BECAUSE THEY WERE ALMOST TOO SHOWBIZZY 
AND THEY WERE QUITE FALSE YOU KNOW 
THEY WERE ALSO FROM DUBLIN WHICH ISN'T REALLY IRELAND AS FAR AS THE PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED 
BUT VAL DOONICAN WAS DIFFERENT 
HE PLAYED IN SHARKS ONE TIME WHEN I PLAYED IN THE RESIDENT BAND 
AND WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT 
THEY COULDN'T HAVE GOT ANOTHER ONE PERSON INTO THAT PLACE 
THEY WERE HANGING FROM THE RAFTERS 
AND HE WAS TREATED LIKE A RETURNING ROMAN GENERAL 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ADULATION AND ADORATION LIKE THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT 
AND I REMEMBER TO THIS DAY 
AND HE TOOK IT ALL VERY NICELY 
AND THE THING I ALWAYS REMEMBER ABOUT HIM WAS 
IT WAS AS IF NOT IN ANY KIND OF BIG HEADED WAY 
HE WAS TALKING TO US AFTERWARDS 
ASKING US ABOUT OURSELVES WHAT WE WERE DOING 
WE SAID OH WE JUST PLAY IN THIS BAND WE'RE QUITE A GOOD BAND 
YOU KNOW IF I SAY SO MESELF HE SAID YOU SHOULD RECORD 
HE SAID I'LL HELP YOU I KNOW PEOPLE I'LL DO THIS 
SO HE WAS A GUY WHO'D BROKEN THROUGH 
AND HE WAS PREPARED TO HELP YOU PEOPLE SENSED THAT 
WALK TAL WALK TALL 
IRISH PEOPLE IT WAS SUCH A BIG THING FOR VAL DOONICAN TO BE A HIT 
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE DIDN'T REGARD THEM AS BEING CITY PEOPLE 
THE WORST THING WAS THAT THEY WERE ALMOST IGNORED 
ALMOST SUB HUMAN THAT'S THE WAY THEY FELT AS IF THEY WERE TREATED 
SO THAT'S THE BACKGROUND IN WHICH VAL DOONICAN JUST EXPLODED AMONGST THEM 
I'M IN PIECES BITS AND PIECES 
IT'S FASCINATING LOOKING AT THE TOP TEN CHARTS AT THAT TIME 
BECAUSE THEY WERE AN EXTRAORDINARY AMALGAM OF TALENT 
WITH THE GUITAR BASED GROUPS 
BUT THEN YOU HAD THESE MUCH MORE TRADITIONAL FIGURES IN THERE 
PLUS NEW STARS LIKE LULU TOM JONES ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK 
SOME PEOPLE GOTTA WHISPER THEIR LOVE SOME THEY GOTTA SHOUT IT 
VAL'S FIRST T. V. SERIES IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE 
QUICKLY ESTABLISHED HIM AS A RELAXED LAID BACK HOST 
HE LIKED WEARING SWEATERS AND IT WAS DIFFERENT FROM A SUIT 
EVERYBODY'S RUNNIN' 
AND SO I HAD TO GO ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
LOOKING FOR SWEATERS THAT WOULD LOOK GOOD IN BLACK AND WHITE TELEVISION 
SO THEY ALL HAD TO HAVE A MOVEMENT ON THEM 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THEY COULDN'T JUST BE PLAIN PINK OR PLAIN BROWN 
THEY HAD TO HAVE MOVEMENT SO THEY SHOWED GREY AND BLACK ON THE SCREEN 
WE'VE ALL HAD A BURDEN TO BEAR 
NOW THE WORLD KEEPS TURNIN' 
VAL'S SEVENTEEN YEAR APPRENTICESHIP HAD MORE THAN PREPARED HIM 
HE COULD HOLD HIS OWN WITH THE BEST OF THEM 
I DO ACTUALLY FANCY MYSELF 
AS SOMEBODY WHO CAN I DON'T MEAN THAT LITERALLY 
NEVER TAKING HIMSELF TOO SERIOUSLY 
WHENEVER YOU FIND SOMETHIN' TROUBLIN' 
FOR A FEE OF TWO GUINEAS YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT DINNY'S 
THE GREATEST DETECTIVE IN DUBLIN 
HELLO HELLO SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED 
ME WIFE HAS FALLEN DOWN THE COAL HOLE 
DO YOU WANT ME TO BRING AN AMBULANCE 
I'D SOONER YOU BRING ANOTHER TON OF COAL 
THE MATERIAL THAT HE CHOSE VERY HUMOROUS DELANEY'S DONKEY THAT KIND OF THING 
NOBODY HAD BOTHERED WITH SONGS LIKE THAT 
NOBODY WOULD SING THOSE SONGS IN IRELAND EVEN 
YOU USED TO HEAR THOSE IN KIND OF VARIETY AND IN CONCERTS 
IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES WHICH IS WHERE VAL CAME UP 
NOW DELANEY HAD A DONKEY 
THAT EVERYONE ADMIRED 
TEMPO'RILY LAZY AND PERMANENTLY TIRED 
A LEG AT EVERY CORNER BALANCIN' HIS HEAD 
AND A TAIL TO LET YOU KNOW WHICH END HE WANTED TO BE FED 
RILEY SLYLY SAID WE'VE UNDERRATED IT 
WHY NOT TRAIN IT THEN HE TOOK A RAG 
I STILL FIND PADDY MCGINTY'S GOAT AND RAFFERTY'S MOTOR CAR 
AND DELANEY'S DONKEY UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENTS 
IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPRESENTATION OF IRISHNESS IN BRITISH POPULAR CULTURE 
LINED UP ATTACKIN' IT AND SHOVIN' IT AND SPANKIN' IT 
THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE TRIED TO PUSH THE TOWN HALL DOWN 
CERTAINLY THERE'S SOMETHING VERY 
COMFORTABLE ABOUT THAT IMAGE 
THE IRISH ARE STILL WHAT THEY ALWAYS WERE AND WILL ALWAYS BE 
THE DAY DELANEY'S DONKEY RAN THE HALF MILE RACE 
THE MUSCLES OF THE MIGHTY NEVER KNOWN TO FLINCH 
THEY COULDN'T MOVE THE DONKEY A QUARTER OF AN INCH 
YES THEY HAVE THIS DIMENSION TO THEM WHICH IS TROUBLESOME 
AND WHICH WILL OCCASIONALLY CAUSE THEM TO MILITATE 
AGAINST THE CONNECTION WITH US 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME GOD HELP THEM 
AREN'T THEY FUNNY AREN'T THEY NICE AREN'T THEY HOSPITABLE AREN'T THEY LOVELY PEOPLE 
STARTED OFF TO CHEER IT BUT IT CHANGED ITS MIND AGAIN 
THERE WAS RILEY PUSHIN' IT SHOVIN' IT SHUSHIN' IT 
HOGAN LOGAN AND MARY A. N. N. MCGRAW 
I DON'T THINK WE EVER THOUGHT OF HIS IRISH SONGS BEING OFFENSIVE 
I THINK MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE FUN 
AND A BIT FOOLISH IN A WAY YOU KNOW 
I MEAN THEY WERE IRISH WEREN'T THEY IN QUOTES 
THE DAY DELANEY'S DONKEY WON THE HALF MILE RACE 
THE CROWD BEGAN TO CHEER IT THEN RAFFERTY 
I KNOW WHAT I DID I KNOW SINGING THOSE SILLY LITTLE IRISH SONGS 
IS RATHER KIND OF MUSIC HALLY I'M AWARE OF THAT 
BUT THERE WERE VERY POPULAR AND ALL THE REST OF IT 
AND I ALWAYS MADE SURE THERE WERE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SONGS IN THE SHOW TO BALANCE THE WHOLE THING OUT 
THEY BOUGHT IT BROUGHT IT AND WITHOUT APOLOGY 
THE DONKEY GAVE A SNEEZE AND BLEW THE WHOLE LOT OUTTA SIGHT 
FUNNILY ENOUGH WHEREVER I GO IN THE WORLD 
THEY'RE THE SONGS PEOPLE'LL ASK ME TO SING 
FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT NOBODY ELSE SINGS THEM THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THE NERVE TO SING THEM 
SO NOBODY ELSE WOULD EVER DO THOSE SONGS 
SO THEY SAY SING THAT LOVELY SONG YOU DO ABOUT SO AND SO AND SO AND WHY NOT 
THEN THE BOOKMAKERS DREW ASIDE AND THEY ALL COMMITTED SUICIDE 
THE DAY DELANEY'S DONKEY WON THE HALF MILE RACE 
OH 
VAL HONED HIS CRAFT IN SUMMER SEASON VARIETY SHOWS AROUND THE COUNTRY 
OFTEN TAKING LYNNE AND NOW THEIR TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS ON THE ROAD WITH HIM 
THE FIRST SEASON IN YARMOUTH 
ARTHUR ASKEY WAS WITH HIM CO TOPS OF THE BILL 
AND I THINK VAL LEARNED A HELL OF A LOT FROM HIM FROM HOW TO WORK ON STAGE AS AN ENTERTAINER 
BECAUSE HE'D ONLY GONE SOLO A FEW YEARS BEFORE THAT 
AND TO BE THE STAR OF A SHOW 
A SUMMER SEASON SHOW HE WAS NOW UP WITH THE BIG BOYS YOU KNOW 
SO TODAY'S A HAPPY DAY 
WE'RE SO GLAD YOU CAME OUR WAY 
HI DE HI DE WAH D. A. DIDDLE WA DOO SKIDDLE ADLE IDDLE BO DI OH DO YEAH 
VAL ALSO DID DUETS DOING THE TWO HANDERS WITH THE COMEDIANS 
THAT MADE HIM SUCH A WELL ROUNDED ENTERTAINER 
AND HE LEARNT FROM IT ALL 
SO CONSEQUENTLY WHEN HE GOT TO DO THE TELEVISION SERIES THAT HE DID WITH THE B. B. C. FROM SEVENTY SIX ONWARDS 
HE WAS WORKING WITH ALL THAT EXPERIENCE BEHIND HIM 
AND CONSEQUENTLY NOTHING PHASED HIM IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO CAME THROUGH THE DOOR ON A TUESDAY 
FROM CHARLEY PRIDE TO ANDY WILLIAMS TO JAMES GALWAY 
THIS LITTLE BRIDGE AT FINAN IS WHERE I WANT TO BE 
HE ALWAYS KNEW HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM 
AND HE ALWAYS KNEW OF A GOOD IDEA THAT WOULD MAKE IT WORK 
WHAT'S VERY UNUSUAL ABOUT VAL IS 
REALLY THE COMBINATION OF THIS VERY VERY EASYGOING CHARM 
AND THAT MAGNIFICENT VOICE YOU'RE SEDUCED IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU HEAR HIM TALK LET ALONE SING 
WHERE SUN AND WIND PLAY 
ON A RING OF BRIGHT WATER 
THAT'S WHERE MY HEARTLAND SHOULD BE 
THE DEER ON THE HILL IN THE FIRST SNOW OF WINTER 
THE GULL IN THE SKY WINGING FREE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GOT VOICES AND CAN'T SING 
VAL DOONICAN HAD A WONDERFUL VOICE BUT HE COULD USE IT HE COULD SING 
EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T GOT VOICES 
WHO ARE WONDERFUL SINGERS BOB DYLAN BOB DYLAN HAS NO VOICE BUT A GREAT SINGER 
AND I CAME TO A PLACE WHERE A RING OF BRIGHT WATER 
HE NEVER STRAINS FOR EFFECT 
HE DOESN'T OFFER A WIDE INTERPRETATION OF SONG 
I DON'T THINK YOU'D EVER WRITE AN ESSAY ON VAL DOONICAN'S INTERPRETATION OF POPULAR SONG 
PARTLY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GO DOWN THE ROUTE THE STANDARD SONG ROUTE MUCH 
SO THERE WEREN'T AS IT WERE PRECURSORS IN THE TYPE OF REPERTOIRE OF SONGS THAT HE SANG 
BUT I'LL ALWAYS SMILE WHEN A RING OF BRIGHT WATER 
ECHOES YOUR LAUGHTER TO ME 
ECHOES YOUR LAUGHTER TO ME 
I REMEMBER READING A THING IN THE SUNDAY TIMES ABOUT SOME FELLA WHO HATED MY SHOW 
HE SAID THAT ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT BEING VAL DOONICAN 
IS AT LEAST YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOSE YOUR VOICE 
SAVOY HOTEL 
IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT THE CRITICS THOUGHT COS THE PUBLIC LOVED HIM 
FOR MICHAEL CAINE A SILVER HEART FILM ACTOR OF THE YEAR FOR HIS PERFORMANCE IN ALFIE 
VAL DOONICAN WAS VOTED TOP B. B. C. T. V. PERSONALITY 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY VAL LEFT THE B. B. C. 
AND MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF IN AMERICA 
BUT AFTER FIVE YEARS HE RETURNED TO DOING WHAT HE LOVED BEST 
LIVE SHOWS ON THE B. B. C. 
AND I KNOW YOU'LL BE THINKING TO YOURSELF 
HE CAN'T BE THAT GOOD 
BUT DO KEEP IT GOING DO KEEP IT GOING COS IT MAKES THE PEOPLE AT HOME THINK I'M TERRIFIC 
ARE WE READY JOHN 
THE IMAGE THAT VAL CARRIED WITH HIM AND I SUPPOSE HE DOES ALMOST TO THIS DAY PROBABLY 
IS THE SWEATERS AND THE ROCKING CHAIR 
WE DID HAVE THE ROCKING CHAIR 
I THINK WE MIGHT'VE BEEN BOOED OFF THE SCREEN IF WE HADN'T HAD IT BUT WE ONLY HAD IT AT THE END 
FROM PIGTAILS TO WEDDING VEILS 
I KNEW IT HAD TO BE A FAMILY SHOW 
IT WAS GONNA GO OUT AT PEAK TIME ON A SATURDAY EVENING 
AND IN BETWEEN 
AND VAL AND I ZOOMED IN ON THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD GIVE IT A SLIGHTLY COUNTRY FLAVOUR 
JUST TO GIVE IT AN IDENTITY THAT WAS DIFFERENT TO WHAT HAD GONE BEFORE 
FROM PLAY TOYS TO COLLEGE BOYS 
YVONNE WOULD SAY WHO WOULD YOU LIKE ON THE SHOW 
AND HE'D SAY THERE'S SOMEONE I HAVEN'T SEEN ON TELEVISION IN THIS COUNTRY EVER 
WHY DON'T WE HAVE HIM OR HER 
CRYSTAL GAYLE CAME OVER HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND DID OUR SHOW 
NOBODY HAD HEARD OF HER OVER HERE 
SITTING ON THE BED THINKING 
THINKING THAT MY HEART'S SINKING 
EVERY DAY THE WORLD GOES BY WITH YOU GONE 
I SUPPOSE IN THE COURSE OF THE SHOW I'D SING EIGHT SONGS 
AND I NEVER USED ANY CUE CARDS OR TELEPROMPTERS 
I NEVER REALLY GOT INTO ALL THAT 
AND SO I WOULD SIT HOME AT NIGHT AND LEARN ALL MY WORDS 
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS 
NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY TILL IT GOES AWAY 
PEOPLE WOULD SAY WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU AND GO ON THERE ON A SATURDAY NIGHT 
WITH MILLIONS WATCHING AND YOU CAN'T REMEMBER THE WORDS 
I SAID I DON'T KNOW I'VE NEVER DONE IT 
THERE WAS DONAGAN DONIGUE DONNICAN 
DONNINGHAM DOONGON AND FINALLY 
DOONICAN THAT'S THE ONE 
THAT'S YOUR MAN 
WE DIDN'T HAVE REAL COMEDY AS SUCH IN THE SHOW EVER 
WE DIDN'T HAVE STAND UP COMICS 
EM BUT WE HOPED WE GOT SOME FUN AND ENJOYMENT 
AND QUITE A BIT OF LAUGHTER WITHIN THE CONTENT OF THE SHOW BY VARIOUS OTHER WAYS 
AND BY HAVING IDEAS AND ROUTINES WITH PEOPLE THAT WOULD GET A SMILE AND A CHUCKLE AND A LAUGH 
PEEP 
PEEP 
HANG ON HANG ON 
LOOK AT VAL AND SAY LET'S TAKE AWAY SOME OF HIS QUALITIES 
TAKE AWAY THIS HAVE YOU STILL GOT SOMETHING 
IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE QUALITY OF HIS VOICE YOU'VE STILL GOT SOMETHING 
IF YOU TAKE AWAY HIS GUITAR PLAYING YOU'VE STILL GOT SOMETHING 
IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE TWINKLE IN HIS EYE YOU'VE STILL GOT SOMETHING 
BUT IF YOU TAKE AWAY HIS HUMANITY YOU'VE NOTHING 
I THINK THAT'S THE KEY TO THE WHOLE THING PEOPLE LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE'S A NICE GUY 
OVER THE YEARS VAL WELCOMED A WIDE VARIETY OF GUESTS ONTO HIS SHOWS 
NOT ALL OF THEM MUSICAL 
I THINK THE FIRST SERIES WE HAD DAVID ATTENBOROUGH AS A GUEST 
HE HAD JUST DONE THE LIFE ON EARTH FIRST SERIES 
AND BECAUSE IT HAD CREATED A GREAT IMPRESSION 
AND I REMEMBER THERE WAS A FROG IN IT THAT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN PAINTED GREEN ENAMEL YOU KNOW 
NOBODY'D EVER SEEN A FROG LIKE THIS AND IT BECAME A STAR OF ONE OF THE SHOWS 
OH THIS IS MY HAVE A LOOK AT THIS FOLKS 
WHAT'S HE DOING 
WELL HE'S FEELING THAT IT'S GETTING A BIT DRY 
AND HE'S GOT GLANDS WHICH PRODUCE WAX OVER HIS EYES 
AND HE'S SPREADING IT ALL OVER HIS BODY SO HE WON'T LOSE MOISTURE 
BUT WHAT HE DOES WITH HIS BACK LEGS 
WHOA WOW I BET YOU WISH YOU COULD DO THAT 
OH I'LL HAVE HIM ON AS A GUEST NEXT WEEK HE'S LOVELY 
PEOPLE USED TO SAY TO ME OH ARE YOU GOING ON THAT 
THINKING SOMEHOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT DEMEANING FOR A CLASSICAL PLAYER 
ON THE CONTRARY I WAS ABSOLUTELY THRILLED AND HONOURED IF I COULD GO ON AND PLAY 
MEMORIES OF THE ALHAMBRA 
BEAUTIFUL SPANISH PIECE CALLED MEMORIES OF THE ALHAMBRA AND OTHERS 
CAVATINA 
ALL THESE NUMBERS VAL WANTED ME TO PLAY ON THE SHOW 
I MEAN NOT JUST THE LUCK THE GOOD FORTUNE FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO DO IT 
BUT FOR THE CLASSICAL GUITAR THE SPANISH GUITAR WHATEVER WE CALL THIS INSTRUMENT 
YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT OF CONCERTS AT THE FESTIVAL HALL OR THE WIGMORE HALL TO PLAY TO EIGHTEEN MILLION PEOPLE 
STRANGE WOOD IS YOUR CRADLE 
STRANGE BIRDS SLEEPY CRIES 
IT CANNOT BE OVER ESTIMATED THE PART OVER THE LAST THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS 
THAT THAT'S PLAYED IN THE POPULARITY SPANISH CLASSICAL GUITAR TODAY 
THE WOOL FROM YOUR EYES 
OH HUSHABY BABY MY RUBY 
ROLF HARRIS ALSO HAD A SATURDAY NIGHT SHOW DURING THE SIXTIES 
AND MARVELLED AT VAL'S ABILITY TO MINE HIS WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE AND TURN IT INTO T. V. GOLD 
TIE ME KANGAROO DOWN SPORT 
TIE ME KANGAROO DOWN 
I WASN'T REALLY A MUSICIAN 
I WAS MORE A SORT OF A. 
A WEIRDY REALLY 
TIE ME KANGAROO DOWN SPORT 
TIE ME KANGAROO DOWN 
IN THE FIRST THIRTEEN PROGRAMMES I'D USED UP EVERY PIECE OF AUSTRALIAN 
OR WEIRD SORT OF MUSICAL CONTENT THAT I'D EVER HEARD OF OR KNOWN ABOUT IN MY WHOLE LIFE 
I'D USED THEM ALL UP IN THIRTEEN WEEKS AND IT WAS LIKE WHAT THE HECK AM I GONNA DO NOW 
I I CAN'T WRITE AND CREATE SONGS LIKE SUN ARISE OVERNIGHT FOR THE NEXT WEEK'S SHOW I CAN'T DO IT 
THEY DON'T COME THAT EASY THEY DON'T 
EM 
AND THE THING ABOUT VAL WAS THAT HE COULD JUST TAKE ANY SONG THAT WAS 
YOU KNOW TOP OF THE POPS AT THE TIME AND DO IT IN HIS OWN VOICE 
COME SHOW ME YOUR KINDNESS 
IN YOUR ARMS I KNOW I'LL FIND THIS 
LYING SAFE WITHIN YOUR ARMS I'M BORN AGAIN AGAIN 
LYING SAFE WITH YOU I'M BORN AGAIN AGAIN 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN AN ARTIST LIKE HIM REALLY 
HE BELONGED TO A PARTICULAR PERIOD IN THE EVOLUTION OF BRITISH MEDIA 
EM AND HE JUST HAPPENED TO GET A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT 
AT THE RIGHT TIME 
JAMES BOND THEME 
VAL WAS VERY GOOD HE'D HAVE A GO AT ANYTHING YOU KNOW 
HE'D LOOK A BIT AND SAY WHAT AM DOING THIS FOR WHEN I GOT HIM THERE 
BUT HE WAS GOOD HE APPRECIATED THAT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO 
EXTEND YOURSELF A BIT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A BIT ORIGINAL 
I CAN FLY AWAY 
I CAN FLY AWAY 
AND GO MY OWN WAY TO PLACES WHERE WE'VE NEVER BEEN TOGETHER 
I CAN FLY AWAY 
HE WRAPPED ME COMPLETELY 
IN KITCHEN FOIL ALL AROUND MY LEGS AND ALL AROUND 
MY WHOLE BODY WAS COVERED OTHERWISE YOU WOULD DIE OF EXPOSURE 
WHAT A WAY TO MAKE A LIVING 
AND IT WAS FANTASTIC HONESTLY 
AS CHILDREN IT WAS JUST PART OF OUR LIVES TO GO TO THE B. B. C. ON A SATURDAY 
WE'D GO TO THE REHEARSALS WE'D WATCH THAT THEN GO TO THE DRESSING ROOM AND HAVE A DRINK WITH DAD 
WE USED TO GO HOME COS DALLAS WAS ON 
YEAH 
MUM AND THE TWO OF US WANTED TO WATCH DALLAS 
SO WE'D GO TO THE REHEARSAL AND THEN GO HOME AND WATCH IT ON THE TELLY SO WE COULD WATCH DALLAS AFTERWARDS 
THE HIGHLIGHT OF EVERY SHOW WAS VAL'S DUET WITH HIS STAR GUEST 
HIS FRIEND BING CROSBY LET HIM INTO A SECRET 
HE SAID IF YOU'VE NEVER SUNG A DUET WITH ROSEMARY CLOONEY 
YOU'VE NEVER SUNG A DUET 
AND YOU KNOW AS I WAS SINGING WITH ROSY IN THE STUDIO 
I THOUGHT GOSH I KNOW WHAT MR. CROSBY WAS TALKING ABOUT NOW 
SHE WAS THE MOST SYMPATHETIC PROFESSIONAL DUET SINGER YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE 
SHE'S WATCHING YOUR LIPS ALL THE TIME 
SO EVERYTHING IS IN ABSOLUTE SYNC AND IT WAS GREAT IT WAS JUST GREAT 
AND SHE WAS NOT ONLY THAT SHE WAS SUCH A NICE LADY SHE REALLY WAS 
I'D LIKE TO GET YOU YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET ME 
ON A SLOW BOAT TO CHINA NOT ON A SLOW OR FAST BOAT 
ALL TO MYSELF ALONE YOU'RE NOT GONNA TAKE MY HEART YOU'RE NOT GONNA BREAK MY HEART 
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU MY OWN 
YOU'LL HAVE TO STAND IN LINE 
GET YOU AND KEEP YOU IN MY ARMS 
NOW THERE'S A NEW ATTACK 
LEAVE ALL YOUR LOVERS ON THE SHORE 
FOR ME THEY'D SWIM TO CHINA TO CHINA AND BACK I BET THEY WOULD 
OUT ON THE BRINY 
WITH THE MOON BIG AND SHINY NOT EVEN IN A ROW BOAT 
MELTING YOUR HEART OF STONE IT'S PARIS OR MAYBE ROME OR MAYBE WE'LL STAY AT HOME 
OR IS IT MADE OF STEEL YOU'LL FIND IT'S VERY REAL 
I'M GONNA GET YOU ON A SLOW BOAT TO CHINA 
ALL TO MYSELF ALONE 
VAL'S HEYDAY SPANNED THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
ALTHOUGH IRISH PEOPLE WERE GENERALLY TREATED WITH SUSPICION 
HIS AUDIENCE REMAINED LOYAL 
IT'S REMARKABLE THAT VAL MANAGED TO MAINTAIN HIS POPULARITY OVER THAT PERIOD 
AND IN THE END PERHAPS IT CAN ONLY BE DOWN TO THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCT THAT HE WAS PURVEYING 
THAT IT WAS SO NON THREATENING 
IT WAS SO WELCOMING IN SOME RESPECTS 
AND THAT HE DID IN BOTH TERMS OF HIS PRESENTATION AND HIS DELIVERY 
HE DID COMFORT PEOPLE TO A LARGE EXTENT 
I WAS APPEARING AT THE LONDON PALLADIUM 
EH FOR A LONG SEASON 
AND I CAN REMEMBER ONE SCARE WE HAD WE HAD A BOMB SCARE 
THE MANAGER OF THE THEATRE 
WE HAD TO EMPTY THE THEATRE AND THEN EVERYBODY CAME BACK IN AGAIN NONSENSE REALLY 
BUT I NEVER HAD ANY PEOPLE SORT OF SAYING BECAUSE I WAS IRISH IT WAS GONNA MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
WE HAD ONE MILLION BAGS OF THE BEST SLIGO RAGS 
WE HAD TWO MILLION BARRELS OF BONES 
WE HAD THREE MILLION SIDES OF OUR BLIND HORSES' HIDES 
AND FOUR MILLION BARRELS OF STONES 
ANOTHER THING ABOUT VAL DOONICAN TOO HE WAS VERY VERY UNTHREATENING 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CONVINCED HE BASED HIMSELF ON PERRY COMO 
HE WAS THIS ULTRA RELAXED UBER RELAXED PERSON 
THE SWEATERS THE ROCKING CHAIR ALMOST COMATOSE 
COMPLETELY RELAXED AND PERRY COMO WAS THE SAME 
THE WAY THAT PERRY COMO KINDA USED HIS ITALIAN AMERICAN IDENTITY 
HE LEANED BACK ON THE ITALIAN THING SURREPTITIOUSLY IN A WAY VAL LEANT BACK ON THE IRISH THING 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME A BRIT 
FROM VAL'S POINT OF VIEW 
BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY WELL ESTABLISHED 
PEOPLE ACCEPTED HIM FOR WHAT HE WAS AND I DON'T THINK THAT THEY 
WOULD'VE SEEN HIM AS A BLOCK OR AS ANY KIND OF A QUESTION MARK 
IN TERMS OF THE TROUBLES AT ALL 
BECAUSE THE TRACK RECORD WAS THERE 
CHILDREN ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN A LAND MADE OF RAINDROPS 
AND PUDDLES AND PUDDLES AND STREAMS 
WHEN GLORIA HUNNIFORD JOINED RADIO TWO IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES 
VAL INTRODUCED HER TO THE BRITISH PUBLIC IN HIS OWN SPECIAL WAY A DUET 
THIS WAS TERRIFIC FOR ME BECAUSE NO ONE KNEW WHO I WAS ANYWAY BECAUSE I ARRIVED IN FROM NORTHERN IRELAND 
IN A WAY ALL OUT OF THE BLUE AND THEN OF COURSE HAD A BURST OF PUBLICITY FOR RADIO TWO 
BUT VAL WAS RIGHT NOBODY KNEW THAT I COULD SING 
SO SUDDENLY I CROPPED UP ON HIS PROGRAMME ON A SATURDAY NIGHT 
THIS LITTLE BOY GREETS THE SNOW WITH A SMILE 
THAT REALLY ENHANCED MY OWN CAREER BECAUSE IT GAVE EXTRA KUDOS 
IT GAVE ME AN EXTRA STRING TO MY BOW 
AND PEOPLE SAW THAT I COULD DO THINGS OTHER THAN JUST PRESENT 
ONE LITTLE FELLOW IS FRIENDS WITH THE WIND 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND YOU WERE LUCKY TO HAVE A PIANO PLAYER NEVER MIND A FULL ORCHESTRA 
SO FOR ME TO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THIS HUGE ORCHESTRA 
OF LIVE SATURDAY NIGHT NATIONAL T. V. 
AND A WEEK TO DECIDE ALONG WITH YVONNE LITTLEWOOD THE PRODUCER 
WHAT WE MIGHT SING HOW WE WOULD DO IT ETC ETC 
WELL IT WAS FANTASTIC 
I KNOW A BOY WHO COULD TALK TO A MOONBEAM AND OWNED ONE OR TWO 
AND THERE ON THE FENCE SITS A GIRL WHO'S CONVINCED THAT THE WORLD IS ALL BLUE 
VAL STRUCK A CHORD WITH A CERTAIN KIND OF AUDIENCE 
THAT ENABLED HIM TO MAINTAIN HIS SUCCESS OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME 
IF YOU DO ONE YEAR YOU'RE DOING WELL IF YOU GET COMMISSIONED TO COME BACK AND DO A SECOND ONE 
YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL 
TWENTY FOUR YEARS IS A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT 
IF I COULD SAVE TIME IN A BOTTLE 
THEN THE FIRST THING I'D LIKE TO DO 
IS TO SAVE ALL MY DAYS TILL ETERNITY PASSES AWAY 
JUST TO SPEND THEM WITH YOU 
IF I COULD MAKE DAYS LAST FOREVER 
AND IF TIME COULD MAKE WISHES COME TRUE 
I'D SAVE EVERY DAY LIKE A TREASURE 
AND THEN AGAIN I WOULD SPEND THEM WITH YOU 
BUT THERE NEVER SEEMS TO BE ENOUGH TIME TO DO THE THINGS THAT YOU WANNA DO WHEN YOU FIND 'EM 
THE VAL DOONICAN MUSIC SHOW ENDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
IT WAS THE END OF AN ERA IN TELEVISION LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT 
I THINK TELEVISION CHANGED 
HIS CHARM AND HIS YOU KNOW SITTING ON THE ROCKING CHAIR AND DOING THE SONGS 
PLAYING AND ACCOMPANYING HIMSELF ON THE GUITAR AND DOING ALL THOSE BITS AND PIECES 
SOMEHOW THERE WASN'T ENOUGH DRAMA IN IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR IS HERE AGAIN 
AND THE FRIENDS THAT WE HOLD SO DEAR ARE NEAR AGAIN 
HIS CHRISTMAS SHOWS ENDED IN NINETEEN NINETY 
AND FOR HIS AUDIENCE CHRISTMAS WAS NEVER QUITE THE SAME AGAIN 
HERE AGAIN ON THIS MAGICAL MARVELLOUS BEAUTIFUL BOUNTIFUL 
OH SUCH A WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR 
ONE OF THE FELLAS WHO WAS INTRODUCING THE PROGRAMME 
SAID IT'S A STRANGE THING BUT SINCE VAL DOONICAN STOPPED DOING CHRISTMAS SHOWS 
CHRISTMAS HAS ENDED ON B. B. C. TELEVISION 
EVERYONE TELLING YOU BE OF GOOD CHEER 
I THINK I DID A CHRISTMAS SHOW EVERY YEAR FROM NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR TO NINETEEN NINETY 
THEN AGAIN THERE WAS A TIME WHEN CHRISTMAS SHOWS LOST THEIR POPULARITY 
PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR PEOPLE SINGING CAROLS AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING 
THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT CORNY 
AND I REMEMBER SEEING ONE PARTICULAR CHRISTMAS SHOW CAME OVER WHICH WAS TAKING THE MICKEY OUT OF CHRISTMAS 
I THOUGHT THAT'S A SAD TIME IN OUR LIVES NOW REALLY 
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT DON'T DO ANYTHING 
I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS ONE DAY SOON 
HE MAY NO LONGER BE THE KING OF SATURDAY NIGHT T. V. 
BUT HE'S STILL REMEMBERED WITH ENORMOUS AFFECTION 
NOW IN THE AUTUMN OF HIS CAREER WITH SOME FIFTY ALBUMS UNDER HIS BELT AND STILL PERFORMING 
VAL DOONICAN WALKS TALL 
I CAN STILL HEAR THE BACKGROUND HE CAME OUT OF I CAN STILL HEAR WATERFORD LITTLE BIT OF DUBLIN 
THAT WHOLE ERA 
AND THERE'S THERE'S A FEELING OF WELL DONE YOU KNOW LOCAL BOY MAKES GOOD IN THE BIG METROPOLIS 
FAIR PLAY TO YOU 
YOU MIGHT WAKE UP SOME MORNING 
FOR ALL THOSE WHO DIDN'T MAKE IT 
FOR ALL THOSE WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE OR THE TENACITY TO PURSUE IT 
THE BOY DONE GOOD 
AND IF YOU'RE QUICK ENOUGH TO RISE 
YOU'LL CATCH THE FLEETING GLIMPSE OF SOMEONE'S FADING SHADOW 
DON'T BE CONCERNED 
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY A NICE GUY AND HE HAD A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE IT WAS A VISIBLE TWINKLE 
AND YOU COULD TELL HE HAD A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOUR 
AND YOU COULD TELL THAT HE JUST LOVED WHAT HE DID 
I'M NOT A PUSHY ENOUGH FELLA AND I THINK IF I'D BEEN A BIT MORE PUSHY 
I MIGHT HAVE DONE A LOT OF EXTRA THINGS BUT PEOPLE MIGHTN'T HAVE LIKED ME YOU KNOW 
AND I THINK THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT REALLY 
I'VE DONE ALL RIGHT I'VE DONE FINE 
JUST STAY AWHILE IN THE SPECIAL YEARS 
THEIR MAGIC WILL SOON BE GONE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU 
THANK YOU 
BYE BYE
