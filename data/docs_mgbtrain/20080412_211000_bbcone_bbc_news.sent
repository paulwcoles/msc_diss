ZIMBABWE IS NOW INTOLERABLE 
WARNS ROBERT MUGABE THAT PATIENCE 
IS WEARING THIN ACROSS THE WORLD 
MR. MUGABE HAD THIS MESSAGE FOR THE 
PRIME MINISTER 
I KNOW BROWN IS A LITTLE TINY DOT 
ON THIS WORLD 
THE HOME LOANS CRISIS THE 
CHANCELLOR URGES THE BIG BANKS TO 
DO MORE FOR MORTGAGE BORROWERS 
WHAT WE'RE SAYING TO BANKS IS 
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP PEOPLE AS WELL 
IF YOU CAN PASS ON THOSE INTEREST 
RATE REDUCTIONS IF YOU CAN HELP 
HOME OWNERS HELP BUSINESSES THAT 
WILL HELP ALL OF US GET THROUGH A 
VERY DIFFICULT TIME 
A MOTHER WHO 
NEEDS A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT IS 
REFUSED ORGANS FROM HER DEAD 
DAUGHTER AND IT'S A WELSH TRIUMPH 
AT TWICKENHAM AS THE OSPREYS LIFT 
THE E. D. F. CUP 
HELLO GOOD EVENING BRITAIN 
STEPPED UP THE PRESSURE ON ROBERT 
MUGABE TODAY OVER ZIMBABWE'S 
ELECTIONS CRISIS GORDON BROWN 
WARNED THAT THE WORLD'S PATIENCE 
WAS RUNNING THIN WITH THE 
ZIMBABWEAN'S PRESIDENT'S FAILURE TO 
RELEASE THE POLL RESULTS WITHIN 
HOURS MR. MUGABE HIT BACK CALLING 
GORDON BROWN A TINY DOT ON THE 
WORLD SOUTHERN AFRICAN LEADERS 
HAVE BEEN MEETING IN ZAMBIA TO 
DISCUSS THE CRISIS BUT MR. MUGABE 
ISN'T ATTENDING FROM LUSAKA ALLAN 
LITTLE REPORTS IT WASN'T THE 
HAPPIEST OF MISSIONS BUT DUTIFULLY 
THABO MBEKI ARRIVED IN HARARE TO 
BRING ROBERT MUGABE TO THE SUMMIT 
IT FAILED MR. MUGABE SEES THE THE 
HAND OF THE OLD COLONIAL POWER 
BRITAIN AT WORK EVERYWHERE TODAY 
GORDON BROWN MADE SURE HE WOULD 
ONCE AGAIN BE THE UNSEEN UNWANTED 
GUEST AT THE TABLE 
THIS IS A 
COMPLETELY INTOLERABLE SITUATION 
IT'S NOW TIME THAT HAVING HAD AN 
ELECTION THE DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS OF 
ZIMBABWE ARE RESPECTED ANY 
INTIMIDATION ANY VIOLENCE IS 
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND I 
THINK THE WHOLE EYES OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ARE NOW ON 
ZIMBABWE AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
ACTION ACTION MR. MUGABE WAS BOUND TO RESENT THAT 
HE ACCUSED BRITAIN OF HIJACKING THE 
LUSAKA SUMMIT THAT TOO HE SAID 
WOULD FAIL 
BROWN IS SURE THE WORLD 
IS LOSING PATIENCE BUT I KNOW 
BROWN IS A LITTLE TINY DOT ON THIS 
WORLD WORLD TWO WEEKS AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION THERE IS STILL NO RESULT 
THE OPPOSITION SAY THE FIGURES HAVE 
BEEN COOKED TO STRIP THEM OF THEIR 
VICTORY THEY SAY THEY WILL NOT 
TAKE PART IN A SECOND ROUND RUN OFF 
SOUTH AFRICA'S PRESIDENT TODAY TOOK 
ROBERT MUGABE'S SIDE IN THAT 
DISPUTE DISPUTE THE LAW PROVIDES THAT THERE SHOULD 
BE A SECOND ROUND SO THAT'S WHAT'S 
HAPPENING I WOULDN'T DESCRIBE THAT 
AS A CRISIS 
NO CRISIS IS NOT WHAT 
THE M. D. C. CAME HERE HOPING TO HEAR 
AND THEY WILL BE DISMAYED THAT MR. 
MBEKI THINKS THEY SHOULD TAKE PART 
IN A SECOND ROUND RUN OFF THEY SAY 
MR. MUGABE IS PLANNING A CAMPAIGN OF 
VIOLENT INTIMIDATION TO ENSURE 
VICTORY 
THE MAN HAS NO RESPECT FOR VICTORY ANY INSTITUTION THAT IS WHY FOR 
INSTANCE TWELVE DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF 
THE ELECTION NO RESULT HAS BEEN 
ANNOUNCED AND IF HE DOES DECIDE TO 
SNAP THEN I THINK THE AFRICANS 
WILL BE MEETING IN THE ROOM NEXT 
DOOR MUST SPEAK STRONGLY AND 
DECISIVELY AGAINST THE DICTATORSHIP 
THE M. D. C. CAME HERE TO TRY TO 
PERSUADE THESE HEAD OF STATE TO 
TELL ROBERT MUGABE UNAMBIGUOUSLY TO 
GO BUT AFRICAN LEADERS DO NOT 
CRITICISE EACH OTHER IN PUBLIC 
THIS SUMMIT 
WE'RE NOT HERE 
TO PUT ROBERT MUGABE IN THE DOCK 
THE ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT SAID THE 
FACT THEY'RE HERE AT ALL IS A SIGN 
OF ONE THING THAT THE CRISIS IS A 
CRISIS FOR THE WHOLE REGION BUT MR. 
MUGABE'S REFUSAL TO COME HERE IS 
ANOTHER GESTURE OF DEFIANCE THIS 
TIME AIMED AT HIS OWN FELLOW 
AFRICAN LEADERS HE'S TELLING THEM 
IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT AS FAR 
AS HE'S CONCERNED THIS IS NONE OF 
THEIR BUSINESS 
AND WE CAN GET MORE FROM OUR 
CORRESPONDENT WHO IS FOLLOWING 
EVENT IN JOHANNESBURG IS THAT IT 
NOW PETER IS THERE ANYTHING THAT 
THAT MEETING IN LUSAKA CAN ACHIEVE 
IT MIGHT WELL ACHIEVE SOMETHING 
THE FACT IS THAT THOSE LEADERS HAVE 
BEEN NOW TALKING FOR MORE THAN SIX 
HOURS AND AND THEY'VE ONLY HAD 
BREAK NOW FOR TEA SO IT SUGGESTS 
SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL IS GOING ON 
BEHIND THOSE CLOSED DOORS THE 
REGION UNDERSTANDS IT HAS A PROBLEM 
ON ITS HANDS AND CAN'T CARRY ON 
LIKE THIS THERE ARE SOME THREE 
MILLION ZIMBABWEANS LIVING OUTSIDE 
THE COUNTRY AS REFUGEES AND THE 
REGION IS PAYING A HEAVY PRICE 
THEY'VE ALSO DRAWNITE A LOT OF 
CRITICISM FROM THE REST OF THE 
WORLD ABOUT THE REGION'S RESPECT 
FOR DEMOCRACY AND I THINK NOW WE 
MIGHT BE SEEING SOME PRESSURE IT'S 
VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH WAY 
THESE LEADERS WILL GO AS ALLAN 
SAID IN HIS PACKAGE MOMENT AGO 
THE LEADERS ARE FAMOUSLY RELUCTANT 
TO CRITICISE ONE ANOTHER IN PUBLIC 
BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME 
ACTION WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 
HOW THINGS PAN OUT OVER THE NEXT 
HOUR OR SO 
THANK YOU HERE HIGH 
STREET BANKS SHOULD PASS ON CUTS IN 
INTEREST RATES TO HOME OWNERS 
THAT'S WHAT THE CHANCELLOR SAID 
TONIGHT SPEAKING IN WASHINGTON 
ALISTAIR DARLING SAID THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS PREPARED TO TAKE 
ACTION TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE 
MARKETS BUT HE URGED BANKS TO DO 
THEIR PART THIS IS WHAT MR. DARLING 
HAD TO SAY 
WE'RE PREPARED TO PLAY OUR PART IN 
TURN WHAT WE'RE SAYING TO BANKS IS 
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP PEOPLE AS WELL 
AND IF YOU CAN PASS ON THOSE 
INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS IF YOU 
CAN HELP HOME OWNERS HELP 
BUSINESSES THAT WILL HELP ALL OF 
US GET THROUGH WHAT IS VERY 
DIFFICULT TIME 
THAT'S SOME OF WHAT 
THE CHANCELLOR HAD TO SAY LET'S 
GET MORE FROM OUR POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT WHO WERE THOSE 
COMMENTS REALLY AIMED AT DO YOU 
THINK LAURA 
JANE I THINK THEY 
WERE AIMED SQUARELY AT THE BANKS 
BUT ALSO AT VOTERS AROUND THE 
COUNTRY TOO MR. DARLING CAN'T MAKE 
THE BANKS PASS ON THE RATE CUT TO 
THEIR BORROWERS BUT MR. DARLING CAN 
APPLY PRESSURE IN THIS VERY VERY 
PUBLIC WAY AND ALSO HE CAN SHOW 
THAT HE HAS SOME SYMPATHY WITH 
PEOPLE WHO MAY BE FEELING THE PAIN 
UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY IN THAT 
AS WE'VE HEARD THREE TIMES IN A 
ROW NOW INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN 
CUT BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND YET 
MONTH AFTER MONTH WHEN THE 
MORTGAGE BILL LANDS ON THE DOORMAT 
THE BILLS SEEM TO BE GOING IN THE 
OPPOSITE DIRECTION UP AND UP AND 
UP FOR MOST PEOPLE SO HERE MR. 
DARLING OFFERS THIS QUID PRO QUO TO 
THE BANKS HE SAYS THE GOVERNMENT'S 
DONE ITS BIT PUMPING BILLIONS INTO 
THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND NOW IT'S 
UP TO THE BANKS TO DO THEIR BIT AND 
PASS ON THE RATE CUTS TO US IT 
SOUNDS PRETTY SIMPLE BUT I'M 
AFRAID IT'S NOT THE COUNCIL OF 
MORTGAGE LENDERS SAYS THAT THE BASE 
RATE AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS ONLY 
ONE OF THE FACTORS THEY TAKE INTO 
CONSIDERATION WHEN DECIDING HOW TO 
SET THEIR RATES AND IT'S NOT THE 
MOST IMPORTANT ONE AND THE RATE 
CUT DOESN'T BEGIN TO ADDRESS WHAT 
THEY SAY IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM 
HERE THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE WANT 
TO BORROW AND HOW MUCH THE BANKS 
HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM IN THE POT 
THE OPPOSITION TONIGHT SAYS IT'S 
ALL VERY WELL FOR MR. DARLING TO SAY 
THIS BUT ESCONTRIBUTED TO MAKING 
OUR WALLETS LIGHTER BY RAISING 
TAXES IN THE BUDGET THESE ARE 
DANGEROUS FOR THE ECONOMY AND 
DANGEROUS TIMES FOR THE POLITICIANS 
WHO LIVE IN THIS FAMOUS STREET 
WHOSE JOB IT IS TO SAFEGUARD IT A A MOTHER WHO NEEDS A KIDNEY 
TRANSPLANT HAS BEEN REFUSED HER 
DEAD DAUGHTER'S ORGANS OFFICIALS 
AT THE HUMAN TISSUE AUTHORITY 
REJECTED LAURA ASHWORTH'S DYING 
WISH THAT ONE OF HER KIDNEYS BE 
GIVEN TO HER MOTHER BECAUSE HER 
REQUEST HAD NOT BEEN FORMALLY 
RECORDED RECORDED THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST IMAGES 
RACHEL LEAKE HAS OF HER DAUGHTER 
TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD LAURA WAS DUE TO BE 
ON HOLIDAY WITH HER OWN CHILD THIS 
WEEK LAURA DIED A FORTNIGHT AGO AT 
HER FAMILY HOME FOLLOWING A SUDDEN 
AND FATAL ASTHMA ATTACK HER MOTHER 
RACHEL SUFFERS FROM KIDNEY FAILURE 
AND THREE COURSES OF DIALYSIS A 
WEEK ALONG WITH A COCKTAIL OF DRUGS 
KEEP HER ALIVE THE FAMILY HOPE 
FROM THE TRAGEDY OF LAURA'S DEATH 
MIGHT COME THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
PROLONG HER MOTHER'S LIFE LAURA 
HAD TOLD FRIENDS AND FAMILY SHE'D 
LIKE TO DONATE KIDNEY TO HER MOTHER 
IT'S WHAT LAURA WANTED SHE MOTHER WANTED TO HELP ME SO I DID MENTION 
THIS TO THE TRANSPLANT CO ORDINATOR 
BUT SHE CAME BACK TO ME AND SHE 
SAID THAT THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW IT 
DOCTORS HERE CONFIRMED THAT LAURA'S 
ORGANS WOULD HAVE BEEN SUITABLE TO 
TRANSPLANT TO HER MOTHER WITH MORE 
THAN SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WAITING FOR ORGAN 
DONATIONS ACROSS THE U. K. IT WAS 
DECIDED IT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THOSE 
WITH THE GREATEST CLINICAL NEED 
RATHER THAN THE CLOSEST FAMILY TIES 
BUT RACHEL IS JUST ONE OF MORE THAN 
SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WAITING FOR AN ORGAN 
DONATION IN THE U. K. THE RULES WHICH 
DECIDE WHICH ORGANS GO WHERE ARE 
CLEAR ONCE YOU'VE DIED ORGANS 
WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED UNLESS THEY'RE 
GIVEN FREELY AND WITHOUT 
RESTRICTION THAT MEANS YOU CAN'T 
NOMINATE A RECIPIENT THE ONLY 
EXCEPTION TO THAT IS IF YOU'RE 
STILL ALIVE WHEN THE DONATION IS 
MADE THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE THE 
RECIPIENT RECIPIENT WHAT THE AUTHORITY IS DOING IS NOT 
UNDER PRESSURE BUT WANTS CAN DITLY 
CANDIDLY AND AND SERIOUSLY TO 
REVIEW THE POSITION TO SEE IF THERE 
ARE ANY EXCEPTIONS THAT COULD BE 
MADE TO THIS GENERAL PRINCIPLE BUT 
IT WON'T DO SO UNTIL IT'S 
CONSIDERED THE MATTER IN GREAT 
DEPTH 
LAURA ASHWORTH'S FAMILY ARE DEPTH COMFORTED THAT OTHERS BENEFITED 
FROM HER ORGANS THEY JUST WISH ONE 
OF THOSE PEOPLE HAD BEEN HER MOTHER 
THE PUB INDUSTRY HAS BEEN 
CRITICISED AS IRRESPONSIBLE FOR 
INCREASINGLY SERVING LARGE MEASURES 
OF ALCOHOL THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF 
PHYSICIANS SAYS GLASS SIZES HAVE 
GOT BIGGER IN RECENT YEARS AND MANY 
PEOPLE NO LONGER KNOW KNOW HOW MUCH 
THEY'RE DRINKING THE LICENSING 
INDUSTRY SAYS IT'S SIMPLY OFFERING 
CHOICE TO ITS CUSTOMERS 
BRITAIN'S BINGE DRINKING CULTURE IS 
BEING FUELLED BY A GREEDY DRINKS 
INDUSTRY ACCORDING TO SOME DOCTORS 
AND POLITICIANS THEY GRAHAM 
DRINKERS ARE BEING ACTIVELY 
ENCOURAGED TO CONSUME MORE AND THAT 
THE SIZE OF THEIR GLASSES HAS 
BALLOONED A SURVEY OF INDEPENDENT 
PUBS FOUND THE ONE TWENTY FIVE M. L. USED TO BE 
STANDARD BUT NOW SIXTEEN PER CENT OF PUBS USE 
IT AS THEIR NORMAL SIZE THE ONE SEVENTY FIVE M. L. 
GLASS IS STANDARD IN THREE QUARTERS 
OF PUBS AND FOURTEEN PER CENT SAY THEY USE THE 
TWO FIFTY M. L. TWO FIFTY M. L. MEANWHILE MANY PUBS AND BARS HAVE 
INCREASED SPIRIT MEASURES OFFERING 
DOUBLES AS STANDARD IT MAKES FOR A 
LETHAL COCKTAIL SAY DOCTORS 
THERE IS NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT MANY 
PEOPLE ARE DRINKING SIGNIFICANTLY 
MORE THAN THEY THEY REALISE MANY 
PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF UNITS THEY 
WANT TO STAY WITHIN SAFE LIMITS BUT 
BEING PUSHED UP WAY OVER SAFE 
LIMITS 
IT'S CLAIMED SOME PUBS PUT LIMITS PRESSURE ON STAFF TO SERVE LARGER 
DRINKS TO 
BUT THE 
INDUSTRY SAYS IT'S MERELY CATERING 
TO WHAT CUSTOMERS WANT 
WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS OF CUSTOMER 
CHOICE SUPERSIZING IS HERE IT'S 
BEEN IN THE OVER FROM AMERICA FOR 
A LONG TIME NOW WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT KING SIZED BEDS SUPERKING 
SIZE GRANDE LATTES YES WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT BEER AND WINE SIZE 
IS INCREASING BUT THE TRICK IS TO 
OFFER VALUE 
WHATEVER THE DEBATE ON 
HOW MUCH TO FILL A GLASS IT ALL 
BOILS DOWN TO CONSUMER CHOICE AND 
THAT'S ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF 
CHEAP ALCOHOL IN SUPERMARKETS AND 
HOW MUCH WE DRINK AT HOME 
I JUST DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE IN 
A NANNY STATE WHERE PEOPLE TELL US 
WHAT TO DO THINK WE CAN ALL MAKE 
OUR OWN MINDS UP AND WE DECIDE 
FOR MOST PEOPLE OPEN A BOTTLE OF 
WINE AND JUST DRINK IT AT PUBS 
DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO MATTER 
THE SIZE OF THE GLASSES 
OFTEN I'M 
IN A PUB AND I'M JUST GIVEN A SMALL 
GLASS AND I FEEL JUST AS CROSS 
ABOUT THAT OR IF I'M DRIVING 
OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO CHOOSE THE 
SMALL BUT EITHER WAY THERE SHOULD 
BE A CHOICE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY IF IF LARGER GLASSES ARE MAKING CUSTOMERS 
UNAWARE OF JUST HOW MUCH THEY'RE 
DRINKING THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS THE 
INDUSTRY SHOULD BE FORCED TO SELL 
SMALLER GLASSES
