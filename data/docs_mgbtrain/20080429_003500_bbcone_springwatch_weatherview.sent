HELLO MANY RECENT HEADLINES HAVE BEEN ABOUT EARLY HAWTHORN BLOSSOMS 
ON THIS WEEK'S SPRINGWATCH 
WE'RE CONCENTRATING ON SIGHTINGS OF THE RED TAILED BUMBLEBEE 
WHICH IS NOW SPREADING ITS REACH TOWARDS SCOTLAND'S BORDERS 
IN FACT AS YOU'LL SEE FROM THIS MAP 
ONE OR TWO HAVE MADE IT EVEN FURTHER NORTH THAN THAT 
YOU CAN KEEP ABREAST OF THE SITUATION ON OUR WEBSITE 
SO FAR THIS WEEK WE'VE SEEN AN ADDITIONAL FORTY FIVE SIGHTINGS 
OF THE RED TAILED BUMBLEBEE 
ONE OR TWO HAVE MANAGED TO STAGGER ACROSS TO NORTHERN IRELAND 
AND SOME HAVE GOT ACROSS THE BORDER ON THAT PULSE OF SPRING WARMTH 
THEY'VE BEEN REPORTED NOT JUST AS FAR AS INVERNESS BUT ONE OR TWO 
HAVE MADE IT OVER TOWARDS THE WESTERN HEBRIDES 
THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE SHAPING UP FOR THE NEW DAY 
I HOPE THE WEATHER WON'T BE TOO DISAPPOINTING 
FOR THOSE BEES THAT HAVE VENTURED FURTHER NORTH AND WEST 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THINGS WILL STAY VERY UNSETTLED INDEED 
OVERNIGHT MANY OF THE SHOWERS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE COURSE OF MONDAY 
WILL BEGIN TO DIE AWAY AND UNDERNEATH THOSE CLEAR SKIES 
IT WILL BE A CHILLY NIGHT IN COMPARISON TO RECENT NIGHTS 
MIGHT BE A HINT OF FROST IN VERY PRONE AREAS 
ACROSS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND THEN MAYBE PATCHES OF MIST AND FOG 
THE REAL CHANGE IS TO BE FOUND AWAY TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST 
WHERE WE'RE GONNA BRING IN MORE CLOUD AND PERSISTENT RAIN 
SOUTH WALES WILL BE JUST ON THE PERIPHERY OF THAT RAIN BAND 
AS WE START OFF THE NEW DAY ON TUESDAY 
AS WE DRIFT THAT FURTHER TOWARDS THE NORTH 
WE'RE BACK INTO THE FAMILIAR PATTERN OF SUNNY SPELLS AND SHOWERS 
BOTH FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE HEART OF SCOTLAND 
AS WE COME FURTHER TOWARDS THE SOUTH 
THERE MAY WELL BE A DOTTING OF SHOWERS TO THE EAST OF THE PENNINES 
AND TOWARDS THE WEST THERE'LL BE SUNNY SPELLS TO START OFF 
THROUGH NORTH WEST ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS AND EAST ANGLIA 
ALL THE WHILE ALONG THE SOUTH COAST 
YOU'LL NOTICE PLENTY OF SHOWERS FROM THE WORD GO 
AS WE MOVE BACK INTO THE FAR SOUTH WEST 
MUCH MORE OF CORNWALL WILL BE SEEING RAIN BY THIS STAGE IN THE MORNING 
AS INDEED WILL THE ISLES OF SCILLY 
LET ME TAKE YOU THROUGH THE REST OF THE MORNING 
YOU'LL SEE THAT PROCESS OF BRINGING CLOUD AND RAIN CONTINUES 
ALL THE WHILE PUSHING THE RAIN EVER FURTHER EAST AND NORTH 
WHILST AT THE SAME TIME ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
THERE'LL BE SUNNY SPELLS AND SHOWERS APLENTY 
SO TAKE YOU OUT OF TUESDAY AND PUSH YOU ON INTO WEDNESDAY 
SEE HOW THAT BAND OF WEATHER ROTATES EVER FURTHER TOWARDS THE NORTH 
COVERING THE REST OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
JUST SHY OF MUCH OF SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND BY THIS STAGE 
DON'T BE TOO DISAPPOINTED BY THAT BECAUSE BY WEDNESDAY 
YOU'LL SEE THAT RAIN PUSHING THROUGH SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
BEFORE SWEEPING ITS WAY BACK THROUGH WALES AND INTO THE HEART OF ENGLAND 
TEMPERATURES WILL PUSH TOWARDS TWELVE OR THIRTEEN SOMETHING OF THAT ORDER 
MORE ON THE WEB FROM ME GOODNIGHT
