SUSIE BARRIE TO WORKSHIRE TO MATCH 
THE FOOD COOKED IN THE STUDIO WHAT 
DID SHE CHOOSE TO GO WITH THE 
BEAUTIFUL KING CRAB 
FRESH CRAB IS A LOVELY SHELLFISH TO 
MIX WITH WINE BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH 
A MIX OF FLAVOURS YOU HAVE THE 
CLEAN FISHY TASTING WHITE MEAT AND 
THE EARTHY BROWN MEAT IT WOULD GO 
WITH ALL KINDS OF WINES FROM A 
SAUVIGNON BLANC SUCH AS THIS TO A 
POWERFUL CHARDONNAY BUT BECAUSE 
CRAB IS SO VERSATILE I AM GOING TO 
CHOOSE A VARIETY THAT IS DIFFERENT 
THAT YOU DON'T TEND TO DRINK SO 
OFTEN THAT'S THE GOBELSBURGER 
GRUNER VELTLINER WHICH IS FRUITY 
AND HAS LOTS OF LOVELY REFRESHING 
ACIDITY ACIDITY AUSTRIAN WINES ARE NOT MADE LARGE 
QUANTITYS SO YOU WON'T SEE MANY 
AROUND BUT THEY'RE REALLY WORTH 
SEEKING OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE 
FANTASTIC FOOD WINES ESPECIALLY IF 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE EATING SEAFOOD 
THAT'S LOVELY IT'S CRISP AND 
REFRESHING AND IT'S GOT A REALLY 
GOOD MIX OF SAVOURY AND FRUITY 
FLAVOURS WHICH ARE GOING TO BE 
PERFECT WITH THE WHITE CRABMEAT 
WITH THE HERBS WITH THE SALTY 
CAPERS AND CUCUMBER THERE IS ALSO 
SOMETHING SPICY ON THE FINISH OF 
THE WINE THAT'S GOING TO BE 
PERFECT TO CUT THROUGH THE RICH 
CREAMY DRESSING YOUR DISH SOUNDS 
DELICIOUS HERE IS SOMETHING JUST A 
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT TO TRY WITH IT 
CHEERS CHEERS GORGEOUS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT GORGEOUS WITH YOUR SALAD 
I THINK IT'S 
REALLY CRISP AND SHARP AND JUST 
REALLY CUTTING SLIGHTLY SPICY AS 
SHOW SAYS IT'S GORGEOUS 
ABSOLUTELY 
IT'S QUITE SALTY VERY ABSOLUTELY SWEET DELICIOUS YOU DON'T DRINK 
BUT YOU ENJOY A SNIFF ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY IT'S GOT LOVELY FLAVOURS TO IT 
THINK IT GOES BEAUTIFULLY WHAT DO 
YOU THINK 
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT 
DOES GO REALLY WELL WITH THE CRAB 
AGAIN IT'S AN EARLY SUMMERTIME 
DRINK YOUNG 
YOU LOVE THE IDEA OF 
THE SUN THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE A 
WONDERFUL TAN 
DON'T START L. WISH 
I WISH I HAD A KITCHEN LIKE THAT WITH 
SUN SUNBEDS 
WITH SOMETHING SUN SUNBEDS YOU CAN JOIN US ON THE SERIES ALL 
YOU HAVE TO DO IS WRITE TO US 
LATER ON ANTONIO CARLUCCIO IS 
MAKING AN OVEN ROASTED DUCK WITH 
PEPPERS FOR SOME ITS ALIAN OPERA 
SINGERS BUT FIRST IT'S TIME FOR 
OUR WEEKLY TRIP TO CORNWALL TO HOOK 
UP WITH THE GREAT RICK STEIN HE'S 
GOT A FRIEND VISITING FROM FRANCE 
FOR ONCE HE GETS TO TAKE A BACKSEAT 
IN THE KITCHEN BUT NOW BEFORE WE 
MEET A MAN WHO CATCHES CONGA FOR A 
LIVING ISLE I'VE GOT AN EELING 
YOU'RE GOING TO ENJOY THIS ONE 
TERRIBLE JOKE ANYWAY THAT FISH PIE 
DID SORRY OH TAKE A LOOK AT 
THIS 
IVOR BATE HE'S LIKE A BULL TERRIER HE REMINDS ME OF THAT SKIPPER IN JAWS 
HE'S LONG LINING FOR CONGER TODAY 
AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT TAKES THE BAIT HE'S BEEN FISHING SINCE HE COULD WALK 
I'VE KNOWN HIM SINCE HE COULD WALK THAT'S A SIGN OF HOW OLD I'M GETTING 
I GOT ADDICTED TO SALMON POACHING WHEN I WAS A KID 
TO OUTSMART THE WATER AUTHORITY 
SOMETIMES I DID SOMETIMES I DIDN'T 
CONGER EEL DOESN'T FETCH A LOT OF MONEY IN THIS COUNTRY BUT IT'S USEFUL FOR ME IN SOUPS AND STEWS 
WHERE I PARTNER IT WITH RED MULLET AND OTHER EXPENSIVE FISH LIKE BASS AND MONKFISH 
AND OILY FISH LIKE MACKEREL AND SPRATS THIS WAS ORIGINALLY A HUMBLE BRETON FISHERMAN'S DISH 
I'VE TRANSFORMED IT INTO SOMETHING MORE SOPHISTICATED 
I ADD MUSSELS WHICH I'VE COOKED IN A RICH BOUILLON WITH WHITE WINE CREAM FENNEL AND SORREL 
THAT PRODUCES SOMETHING WHICH SALIERI IN AMADEUS MIGHT HAVE SAID WITH GRITTED TEETH 
RICH AND FULSOME BUT FRESH TASTING 
THIS IS CHARLES FONTAINE A FRENCHMAN A CHEF A FRIEND OF MINE FROM LONDON 
WHO BELIEVES WE LOST OUR CULINARY HERITAGE DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
WHEN WE LEFT THE LAND HE FINDS OUR PASTIES HARD TO TAKE WHICH I FIND EXTRAORDINARY 
AS HE LOVES ENGLISH FOOD HE CHAMPIONS THE CAUSE OF ENGLISH FISHERMEN 
FOR THE FIRST TIME ON BRITISH T. V. A FRENCHMAN IS GOING TO CREATE A TRADITIONAL BRITISH DISH 
WE ARE GOING TO DO A FISH PIE A TYPICAL ENGLISH DISH 
WE'VE GOT MUSSELS WHICH WE'RE COOKING FROM CORNWALL 
MUCH MORE SALTY THAN THE LOCH FYNE ONES 
WE'VE GOT MONKFISH A FIRM FISH 
WE'VE GOT COD IT'S SLIGHTLY SOFTER 
AND WE'VE GOT LEMON SOLE WHICH IS EVEN SOFTER THEY GO WELL TOGETHER 
A BIT OF STOCK WHITE WINE WATER SOME BAY LEAVES CARROTS CELERY FENNEL A BIT OF PARSLEY AND ONION 
WE ALSO HAVE SOME BEAUTIFUL BUTTON MUSHROOMS WHICH I COOKED EARLIER IN WHITE WINE SHALLOTS AND BUTTER 
WE'VE ALSO GOT SOME MASHED POTATOES WHICH WE'RE GOING TO MIX WITH THE BUTTER THE EGGS 
A BIT OF PRAWN WE'LL PUT ON TOP OF OUR THREE FISH OUR MUSSELS ARE READY 
WE WILL DRAIN THEM 
ALSO THE STOCK WE'VE GOT TO DRAIN THAT BECAUSE THE VEGETABLES ARE NOT PART OF THE DISH 
NOW WE'RE READY TO COOK THE FISH 
CHARLES IS A WONDERFULLY RUDE AND ARROGANT FRENCHMAN 
BUT THE GREAT DISARMING THING ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE'S PASSIONATE ABOUT ENGLISH FOOD 
SOMETIMES I WONDER WHY BUT I THINK MAYBE WE DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD OUR FOOD IS 
WE'RE GOING TO COOK OUR FISH FIRST MONKFISH BECAUSE IT IS FIRMER THAN THE OTHERS 
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN I STARTED COOKING IN THIS COUNTRY NOBODY KNEW ABOUT MONKFISH 
WE'LL PUT OUR COD AND LEMON SOLE IN TOGETHER WHEN THEY'RE COOKED THE MONKFISH WILL BE READY 
I DON'T THINK MY MOTHER WOULD DO IT 
BUT YOUR MOTHERS WOULD DO IT IT'S SUCH AN EASY DISH AND NOBODY TAKES THE TIME TO DO IT 
PEOPLE WOULD RATHER BUY IT FROZEN THAT'S WHY WE'VE LOST ALL THE ENGLISH COOKING 
OUR FISH ARE COOKED NOW WE BUNG IT IN A DISH 
THE MUSSELS 
AND BUTTON MUSHROOMS THAT'S IT 
NOW THE SURPRISE OF THE DISH PRAWN FRESH FROM THIS MORNING 
NO I'M KIDDING IT'S JUST FROZEN 
I'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH THE SAUCE PUT BUTTER IN A PAN NOT TOO HOT IT'S GOT TO MELT SLOWLY 
A BIT OF FLOUR IT'S CALLED A ROUX 
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH 
AND SLOWLY YOU ADD YOUR STOCK 
THEN WE'RE GOING TO LET IT COOK FOR FIVE MINUTES I WOULD SAY 
LET'S TASTE M. M. M. 
BUT I NEED THE APPROVAL OF THE MASTER RICHARD WOULD YOU MIND TASTING MY VELOUTE 
OF COURSE I DON'T MIND CHARLES 
AH THAT IS SO GOOD VELOUTES ARE NOT FASHIONABLE NO BUT THAT IS SUCH A NICE FISH SAUCE 
IMAGINE THAT THICKNESS WITH BUTTER AND CREAM IT WOULD MAKE YOU GAG 
THAT IS A BEAUTIFULLY MADE SAUCE VELOUTE IN ENGLISH MEANS VELVETY THAT IS LIKE WHITE VELVET 
VERY SEXY CHARLES 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE MARSEILLAISE BACK TO MY SHALLOTS 
NOW I'VE GOT THE APPROVAL FROM THE MASTER ALL I NEED TO DO IS COVER MY FISH WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL SAUCE 
WHITE VELVET THAT'S A GOOD NAME BEAUTIFUL 
I'LL GIVE IT A BIT OF SPACE SO IT GOES THROUGH THE FISH 
THIS IS A SAUCY LITTLE SAUCE 
NOW WE'VE GOT TO TASTE THE SEASONING 
NEED A BIT OF PEPPER 
THE LAST ADDITION A BIT OF NUTMEG WHICH I THINK IS BEAUTIFUL IN MASHED POTATOES 
NOW WITH THE PIPING 
BEAUTIFUL CREAMY LOOK AT THAT YOU CAN PUT A LOT OF POTATO ON TOP 
BECAUSE IT'S ACTING AS VEG IT'S PART OF THE DISH 
NOW IT'S READY TO GO IN THE OVEN FOR ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY MINUTES 
BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY GAS MARK EIGHT FOR YOU AT HOME 
I THINK IT'S READY NOW OH LOOK AT THAT 
RICK DO YOU WANT TO TASTE IT YES 
IT'S BEEN SMELLING SO GOOD IT IS GOOD HUH 
GOD I'M QUITE PLEASED WITH THAT YOU'RE A CLEVER FRENCH PERSON 
IT REALLY WAS GOOD FISHY AND CREAMY 
A CLASSIC ENGLISH DISH WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN ONLY FIND DEEP FROZEN THESE DAYS 
THAT FISH PIE DID LOOK DELICIOUS 
HAVING BEEN BORN OVERSEAS MYSELF I 
CAN IDENTIFY WITH RICK PEOPLE ARE 
OFTEN SURPRISED I AM SO PASSIONATE 
ABOUT BRITISH COOKING AND FOOD AT 
THIS TIME OF YEAR THERE IS ONE 
INGREDIENT THAT TOTALLY SUMS UP 
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS COUNTRY AND 
IT HAS TO BE THE MOST BRILLIANT 
ASPARAGUS THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS TO 
USE IT BUT ONE OF MY FAVOURITES 
HAS TO BE WITH A VERY SIMPLE PASTA 
DISH I GREW UP WITH AS KID AM 
GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO IT NOW 
AND I AM GOING TO COOK IT FOR YOU 
STEPHEN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED STEPHEN THIS IS BASED ON CARBONARA THE 
CLASSIC WITH SOME FETTUCINI BACON 
ASPARAGUS SOME PARMESAN CHEESE 
SOME EGGS AND PARSLEY IT'S ANY 
FIRST SHOW SO I AM KEEPING THE 
RECIPE FAIRLY SIMPLE SO I AM GOING 
TO START MUCKING AROUND WITH THIS 
AND GET THIS RIEND OFF HERE 
RIEND OFF HERE YOU'RE BIT OF 
MEAT AND TWO VEG MAN YEAH WHAT YEAH WHAT ABOUT NOW AS YOU GET OLDER DO YOU 
COOK A LOT MORE 
YEAH THERE IS A 
CHOICE IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT YOU 
CAN VISIT ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD 
ANY STYLE OF COOKING YOU'RE SORT 
OF SPOILT FOR CHOICE REALLY WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE FACT YOU'VE GOT CHILDREN 
DOES THAT INFLUENCE WHAT YOU COOK 
YEAH WELL DAISY LOVES BEING IN 
THE KITCHEN SHE LOVES SUNDAY 
MORNING IS PANCAKE MORNING AND 
GETTING FRUIT AND ALL SORTS OF 
COMBINATIONS GOING IN IT'S A JOY 
JUST TO GET IN THERE AND GET BUSY 
BUT IT IS A BIT OF JOY WITH KIDS 
BECAUSE THEY SEE IT VERY VERY 
DUR.LY DON'T THEY THEY SEE IT AS 
A FUN ACTIVITY RATHER THAN BEING 
SOMETHING THAT IS A CHORE SO MANY 
PEOPLE NOW I THINK THINK THAT 
COOKING IS A CHORE BUT IT SHOULD 
BE A LOT MORE FUN YEAH 
WHAT ABOUT YEAH AS PERSON GROWING UP IS THERE 
ANY REASON WHY YOU WOULDN'T 
EXPERIMENT AND COOK VERY MUCH WELL WELL WE HAD SORT OF A HOME ECONOMIC 
CLASS AND WE WERE ASKED TO COOK A 
CHRISTMAS PUDDING AND DELICIOUS DELICIOUS WE WERE LOOKING AROUND FOR THE 
INGREDIENTS AND MY DAD FOUND THIS 
BOX OF SUETTES IT WAS SORT OF 
BEFORE THE DAYS OF SELL BY DATES 
AND THINGS LIKE THIS SO I DON'T 
KNOW HOW OLD THIS WAS BUT THE 
WHOLE THING JUST TASTED LIKE A BIG 
KEG OF SOAP AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY 
FOUL SO IT WAS SLIGHTLY OFF 
PUTTING YOUR EARLY DISASTERS ARE 
THE ONCE YOU REMEMBER 
THE OTHER 
THING OF COURSE IS DURING 
CHRISTMASTIME IT'S NOT THAT 
APPEALING 
NOT REALLY 
CHRISTMAS IS APPEALING SUPPOSED TO BE JOYOUS DAY YES L. YES I HAVE HEARD ON THE GRAPEVINE 
SOMETHING ABOUT A CHICKEN YOU HAD 
HAD A FRIEND WHO COOKED A CHICKEN

SO YOU HAD 
SORT OF PLASTIC STUFFED CHICKEN 
AND WE WERE TOO POLITE AND JUST 
SUFFERED ON SO WE DIDN'T HURT HER 
FEELINGS

BUT THE FACT IS ACTUALLY YOU HAVE 
TO BE A LITTLE BIT HONEST ABOUT 
WHAT PEOPLE ARE COOKING ASPARAGUS 
BOILING HOT WATER FETTUCINI 
COOKING I HAVE BACON ON WITH LOTS 
OF SALT AND PEPPER IN THERE BECAUSE 
THAT FLAVOUR NEEDS TO COME OUT AS

WITH A SPINACH AND PANEER SAUCE 
ALL SERVED ON TORTILLAS WHAT COULD

OPENED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN THIS RESTAURANT'S 
CLAY OVEN IS THE SECRET MR. SINGH 
HAS BEEN COOKING HERE FOR ALMOST TWENTY 
YEARS LIKE EVERY GREAT TANDOORI 
CHEF HE HAS HIS OWN SECRET RECIPE 
FOR PERFECT CHICKEN THIS IS THE 
OPPORTUNITY FOR ME OBSERVE A REAL 
MASTER AT WORK THE FIRST STAGE IS 
TO SLASH THE CHICKEN 
SO THE SPICES 
CAN GO INSIDE TOTALLY MARINATE THE 
WHOLE CHICKEN 
GOT IT GOING TO 
SALT THE CHICKEN 
CHILLI POWDER O. K. 
THIS IS A METHI POWDER 
SALT THE CHICKEN CHILLI POWDER O. K. THIS IS 
METHI IS DRIED FENUGREEK LEAVES POWDERED 
POWDER 
GARAM MASALA THAT'S YOUR SECRET GARAM MASALA 
DRIED 
THIS IS METI POWDER DRIED FENUGREEK GARAM MASALA 
MIXED GARAM MASALA O. K. FENUGREEK 
FENUGREEK PEPPER GINGER 
PASTE WHY IS 
THAT GREEN GINGER AND GARLIC PASTE 
GREEN CHILLIES 
I SEE SO 
GIVING ME MORE SECRETS O. K. WITH MY 
HAND ALRIGHT 
O. K. WITH MY HAND ALL RIGHT 
AND LEMON JUICE 
LEMON JUICE 
YOU PUT QUITE A BIT OF THAT 
I'VE MIXED ALL OF THE SPICES AND THE GINGER GARLIC AND CHILLI PASTE 
O. K. NOW WE MAKE THE YOGHURT 
THEN IT'S TIME TO CREATE THAT FAMOUS TANDOORI COLOUR WITH A YOGHURT MARINADE 
CHILLI POWDER AND SALT AND GARAM MASALA 
AND BLACK PEPPER AND KASURI METHI AND GARAM MASALA GINGER POWDER 
IS THAT RED CHILLI POWDER 
IS THAT FOR COLOUR YES 
YOU DON'T USE ANY FAKE COLOURINGS DO YOU NO NO 
PEOPLE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FAKE COLOURING IN INDIAN FOOD BUT IT'S NOT REALLY TRUE 
LOOK AT THAT BEAUTIFUL ORANGE COLOUR SO THAT'S FROM THE PAPRIKA 
YES ONCE THE CHICKEN IS COVERED IT'S READY FOR THE TANDOOR 
THIS IS THE FINAL STAGE IN THE PROCESS AND IS WHERE THE CHICKEN GETS ITS CHARGRILLED FLAVOUR 
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN THE TANDOOR MUST BE EXTREMELY HOT OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DEGREES' 
OH MY BIG TANDOORI MOMENT 
WOW IT IS HOT 
WHOO THAT'S HOT 
SO THAT'S GOING TO TAKE ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO COOK 
I CAN'T WAIT I'M SO EXCITED MY OWN TANDOORI CHICKEN 
GRAB A CLOTH JUST TAKE IT OUT 
IS THIS CLEAN I PUT IT IN HERE 
LOVELY THANK YOU 
I'M A PRO VERY GOOD THANK YOU 
SO DO IT THE INDIAN WAY 
JUST KIND OF USE THE NAAN TO PROTECT MY FINGERS 
M. M. M. LOVELY 
NOT SPICY AT ALL MAYBE SLIGHTLY BUT GOOD SPICE 
REALLY FULL OF FLAVOUR 
WELL DONE THANK YOU 
HAVING TASTED GAYLORD'S CHICKEN BACK AT HOME I'M FEELING SUITABLY INSPIRED TO START COOKING MY OWN 
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A TANDOOR OVEN I'VE CREATED MY OWN RECIPE FOR AUTHENTIC TANDOORI FOOD 
IT'LL WORK JUST AS WELL IN A NORMAL OVEN OR ON A BARBECUE 
THE YOGHURT MARINADE I'M GOING TO MAKE IS MUCH SIMPLER 
THAN MR. SINGH'S BUT WILL WORK REALLY WELL IN MY NORMAL OVEN 
IF YOU ADD ABOUT A TEASPOON AND A HALF OF CHILLI POWDER 
ABOUT THREE TEASPOONS OF GARAM MASALA WHICH IS THAT ONE 
TANDOORI FOOD IS REALLY SIMILAR IT'S A LOT OF YOGHURT AND SOME SPICES 
AND THEN YOU CUSTOMISE IT 
TO WHATEVER YOU'RE IN THE MOOD FOR RIGHT THIS IS THE GENERIC 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING ELSE TO IT IT'S THIS SIMPLE 
THAT'S MY GINGER ROUGHLY CHOPPED SO I'M GOING TO WHIZZ IT ALL UP AND ADD IT TO THE YOGHURT 
I'M ALSO ADDING EIGHT CLOVES OF GARLIC 
COULD YOU JUST GET A LEMON AND SQUEEZE IN HALF A LEMON'S WORTH 
I'M GOING TO ADD MY GINGER AND GARLIC 
CAN YOU ADD A GOOD SLUG OF OIL THAT COMES OUT SLOWLY SO JUST ENOUGH THAT IT DOESN'T GET TOO DRY 
DO YOU USUALLY DO IT THE NIGHT BEFORE SO YOU CAN KEEP IT IN THE FRIDGE FOR A WHOLE TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
EXACTLY THE LONGER THE CHICKEN WILL MARINATE THE MORE THE FLAVOUR GETS INTO THE CHICKEN 
AND NOW FOR MY SECRET INGREDIENT CHEDDAR CHEESE 
IT MAY SEEM LIKE A STRANGE ADDITION TO INDIAN FOOD BUT IT MAKES THE MARINADE REALLY CREAMY 
I'M ALSO GOING TO USE AN EGG TO BIND ALL THE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER 
AND HELP THE MARINADE CLING TO THE CHICKEN 
I CAN'T EVEN DO THAT PROPERLY I GOT LOTS OF SHELL IN IT DID YOU 
PANTHEA'S NOT USED TO GETTING HER MANICURED HANDS DIRTY BUT I'M CONVINCED 
THAT WITH A LITTLE HELP SHE'LL MAKE A GOOD COOK AS SHE'S GOT A REAL NOSE FOR SPICES' 
IT'S REALLY FAMILIAR I KNOW THIS 
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND WHAT ARE YOU EATING 
WHAT ARE YOU EATING 
IT'S REALLY FAMILIAR 
WHAT ARE YOU EATING CARDAMOM 
CARDAMOM IS A COMMON INGREDIENT IN INDIAN COOKERY 
THE SEEDS ARE REMOVED FROM THE POD WHICH ARE THEN POUNDED TO A FINE POWDER 
I USE IT WHEREVER I CAN AND IT'LL GIVE A DELICIOUS AROMATIC FLAVOUR TO THE MARINADE 
I LOVE GREEN CARDAMOM SO I'M HAPPY TO ADD IT TO ANYTHING 
O. K. THAT'S DONE 
SO THAT IN EFFECT IS OUR ENTIRE CHICKEN MARINADE 
IF YOU CAN ADD THE CHICKEN INTO THERE THEN DON'T LICK YOUR HANDS COS THE CHICKEN IS RAW SORRY 
BUT HOW DOES THAT TASTE NOW 
REALLY GOOD I COULD JUST USE IT AS A DIP 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S VERY GARLICKY 
BUT THEN YOU'RE FROM IRAN SO YOU HAVE GARLICKY DIPS DON'T YOU 
YES I LIKE THAT SO PUT THE CHICKEN INSIDE THEN THROW IT IN THE FRIDGE ALL RIGHT 
O. K. WELL THIS IS PRETTY GOOD 
I THINK I COULD DO THIS YOU COULD DO THAT 
YES THAT WOULD FEED A WHOLE LOAD OF YOUR FRIENDS AND THEY'D BE VERY APPRECIATIVE 
BUT THEY WOULD ALL THINK THAT I BOUGHT IT FROM OUTSIDE 
NO ONE WOULD REALLY BELIEVE ME EVEN IF I REALLY WAS DOING IT 
I'M GOING TO LEAVE THE CHICKEN TO MARINATE OVERNIGHT 
I'M ALSO GOING TO DO LAMB TIKKA BROCHETTES AND TANDOORI MUSHROOMS 
IT'S THE SAME BASIC MARINADE AS FOR THE CHICKEN BUT BECAUSE LAMB HAS A STRONGER TASTE 
SO YOU COULD HAVE ADDED PEPPERS AND SOME OTHER STUFF IF SOMEONE WAS VEGETARIAN 
EXACTLY SEE NOW YOU'RE THINKING LIKE A COOK 
IN THE FRIDGE EXCELLENT THANK YOU 
THE CHICKEN AND MUSHROOMS GO INTO 
THE OVEN FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES AM GOING 
TO SERVE THE MEAT IN TORTILLAS WITH 
A HERB CHUTNEY AND A CHUNCHY SALAD

GALTON'S PERFECT PORK GALTON'S DISH IS FULL OF A WHOLE 
LOAD OF FLAVOURS YOU'VE GOT SWEET 
TOASTED GARLICKY AND SPICY WHAT 
WE NEED IS A REALLY GOOD RIPE 
FRUITY WINE THAT CAN COPE WITH ALL 
OF THAT BECAUSE IT'S A PORK DISH 
WE COULD CHOOSE A WHITE A RED 
EVEN A ROSA SUCH AS THIS ONE FROM 
SOUTH AFRICA BUT I THINK WITH THE 
PORK CARROTS AND HONEY A WINE 
WITH SOFT SPICY APE CONTINUE AND 
PEACH FLAVOURS WOULD WORK WELL L. L. 
AM GOING TO CHOOSE THE CASILLERO 
DEL DIABLO VIOGNIER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FROM 
CHILE 
THIS WINE IS A GOOD CHOICE IF YOU 
TEND TO FIND MOST WINES TOO ACIDIC 
BECAUSE IT HAS WIPE FRUIT FLAVOURS 
AND QUITE A LUSCIOUS TEXTURE IT'S 
PERFECT IT HAS JUST THOSE PERFUMED 
APRICOT FLAVOURS I WAS LOOKING FOR 
TO GO WITH THE PORK AND THE CARROTS 
THERE IS SOMETHING SPICY TO MATCH 
THE GINGER AND SESAME AND ENOUGH 
WEIGHT TO COPE WITH THE HONEY AND 
GARLICKY POTATOES SO GALTON IT'S 
A LOVELY SUMMERY WINE AND I JUST 
HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY IT WHAT DO YOU 
THINK OF THAT 
THAT IS I LIKE 
CHILLI IN WINES I MUST ADMIT BUT 
THAT PACKS A PUNCH IT'S FULL OF 
FLAVOUR I LIKE IT 
THERE'S A GATE 
THING ISN'T THERE ABOUT THE WHOLE 
PEACHES AND APRICOTS YOU'RE 
SMELLING AWAY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF 
THE SMELL OF THAT 
BEAUTIFUL IT 
COMPLEMENTS THE FOOD PERFECTLY IT IT DOES GO TO SHOW THAT THE PALATE 
COMES THROUGH YOUR NOISE WHAT DO 
YOU RECKON 
WHAT IS GOOD IS MANY 
PEOPLE DON'T ASSOCIATE PORK WITH 
ASSOCIATE PORK WITH RED WINE SO 
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE WHITE WINE IT'S 
VERY UNPREDICTABLE 
TOO POSH 
FITTING I SHOULD SAY 
IT'S ONLY 
FIVE POINT NINE NINE THE WHOLE IDEA OF SUMMER 
WARM WEATHER BEAUTIFUL FOOD LIKE 
THAT WHICH IS ELEGANT AND A WINE 
LIKE THAT IT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO 
ISN'T IT 
VERY SOPHISTICATED YOU YOU COULD BE JOINING US HERE AT THE 
CHEF'S TABLE SOME TIME IN THE 
SERIES ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WRITE 
TO US 
IT'S TIME TO STEP BACK IN TIME TO 
MEET UP WITH THE GREAT KEITH FLOYD

B. B. C. ARCHIVE HE'S IN NEW ORLEANS TO 
PAY A VISIT TO THE LOCAL COOKERY 
SCHOOL NOW IF THERE ARE ANY 
IMPRESSIONABLE YOUNG GUYS OUT THERE 
WATCHING THEN I HAVE A SMALL PIECE 
OF ADVICE FOR YOU THINK VERY 
CAREFULLY BEFORE GROWING BEARD 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU MANAGE TO GET ON 
T. V. AND THAT SHOW IS REPEATED TWENTY 
YEARS LATER TAKE A LOOK AT THIS 
TO MAKE THE PERFECT SHELLFISH GUMBO 
YOU NEED FIST FULL OF DOLLARS AND 
HOW ARE YOU DOING SIR WHAT AND WHAT DO I NEED FOR A GOOD SHELLFISH 
GUMBO

AND SOME OYSTERS BRILLIANT CRAWFISH TO GO IN THERE 
I LIKE IT 
THIS THING HERE WHAT IS THIS 
CAGON BUDUN CRAWFISH BUDUN 
FANTASTIC THE THINGS THE NOUVELLE 
CUISINE CHEFS ARE MAKING THESE DAYS 
IT IS HARD FOR A RESTAURATEUR TO 
COMPETE AGAINST SOMEBODY'S HOME 
COOKING BECAUSE AS YOU TASTE IT 
THE PEOPLE WILL SAY ABOUT A GUMBO 
MY GRANDMOTHER DID BETTER THAN 
THIS OR I DID BETTER THAN THIS 
AND THAT'S THE FUN PART ABOUT IT 
BUT ALL OF OUR FOOD WE HAVE A 
PASSION FOR EATING WE HAVE A 
PASSION FOR LIFE 
I'LL TELL YOU 
WHAT I AM THIS ACTUALLY IS MY 
MY VIEWERS THIS IS MY 
SHOW 
NO THIS IS NOT YOUR SHOW SHOW BIG BAD JOE YOU GOT TO GO ME O. 
MY O. 
INTO OUR HOT FAT THE FIRST THING WE 
HAVE TO DO IS THROW IN SOME ONIONS 
YOU MIGHT GET SMOKE IN YOUR EYES 
BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT WE NEED A 
FEW OF THESE PEPPERS THEY CALL 
THEM BELL PEPPERS L. CALL THEM 
PEPPERS BUT THEY DO LIKE TO TAKE 
THE WHOLE THING TO THE MAXIMUM WE 
NEED SOME CHOPPED CELERY L. AM NOT 
GOING TO DO IT AS FAST AS I 
NORMALLY DO WE HAVE SOME CHOPPED 
CELERY O. K. AND WE SWEAT ALL THESE 
VEGETABLES DOWN FOR A SECOND OR TWO 
RIGHT THE NEXT THING THAT I AM 
GOING TO DO IS PUT IN JOE'S MIX L. 
MEAN THIS IS A MIXTURE OF HERE I 
HAVE TO REFER TO MY NOTES BECAUSE I 
TOLD YOU I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THESE 
THINGS THIS IS YOU COULD BE 
LOOKING AT THAT WHILE I AM READING 
IT'S A MIXTURE OF FRESHLY GROUND 
RED PEPPER SWEET PAPRIKA SALT 
WHITE PEPPER BLACK PEPPER DRIED 
THYME LEAVES OREGANO LEAVES IN 
AMERICA OREGANO TERRIBLY SORRY 
AND A BAYLEAF ALL STUFFED INTO 
THERE THIS GOES NOW WE HAVE 
SWEATED THESE VEGETABLES DOWN A BIT 
THAT GOES IN THERE AS WELL AND 
THIS IS GOING TO HELP US TO MAKE A 
BIT OF A RUE RUE 
SOMETHING BROUGHT TO THE GUMBO BY THE INDIGENOUS AMERICAN INDIANS IS THE FILE 
NOW THIS IS SASSAFRAS LEAVES POUNDED UP O. K. 
WE PUT SOME OF THAT IN SOME SAY IT GOES IN LATER AT THE END 
FILE MEANS STRING AND IT TURNS INTO A KIND OF A STRINGY THING IN THE POT WHEN IT GOES IN LATER 
ANOTHER SCHOOL OF THOUGHT SAYS PUT IT IN RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING WHICH FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE TO ME 
THEY LIKE THESE THINGS A LITTLE HOT BUT NOT TOO HOT 
SO A BIT OF TABASCO OR CHILLI SAUCE INTO THERE 
AND LIKE ALL SUNSHINE COOKING WE NEED SOME TOMATO SAUCE 
THIS IS SIMPLY PUREED FRESH TOMATOES STRAINED THROUGH TO REMOVE PIPS AND SKIN 
SO WE'LL PUT A BIT OF THAT IN 
YOU'LL HEAR IT SAID THE WHOLE TIME IN THIS NEW ORLEANS PROGRAMME THAT ANYTHING FOR A GUMBO GOES 
YOU CAN PUT IN WHAT YOU LIKE 
AS WE'RE MAKING THIS FOR A PARTY THERE ARE NO PRECISE INGREDIENTS 
YOU CAN BUY MY BOOK IF I WRITE IT FOR THE EXACT QUANTITIES 
STAY THERE CLIVE I NEED THE FISH STOCK NOW 
YOU MIGHT GET STEAM ON YOUR LENS I HOPE YOU CAN COPE WITH THAT 
THE FISH STOCK GOES INTO THERE 
SEE ALL THE LOVELY INGREDIENTS I'VE USED TO MAKE THAT STOCK 
THAT'S TROUT HEADS TROUT ARE DIFFERENT HERE FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD BUT IT IS TROUT 
AND NOW WE HAVE OUR BASIC GUMBO MIX 
YOU TAKE A CLOSE UP ON THAT 
THE DIRECTOR NOW HAS TO DREAM UP A LOVELY CUTAWAY 
BECAUSE THAT MUST NOW SIMMER FOR AT LEAST FORTY FIVE MINUTES BEFORE I CAN CONTINUE THE PROCESS 
YOU'LL KNOW THAT CARNIVAL MEANS FAREWELL TO THE FLESH 
IT'S THE SEASON FROM TWELFTH NIGHT UNTIL THE WEDNESDAY AFTER PANCAKE TUESDAY 
THAT WAS WHEN THE THREE WISE KINGS VISITED YOUNG JESUS 
THE KING CARRYING THE GOLD SAID MY CAMEL'S GOT A STONE IN ITS PAW 
YOU TWO GO ON AHEAD AND I'LL BE ALONG LATER HONEST 
NOW AT LEAST FORTY FIVE MINUTES HAS PASSED AND IT'S GIVEN ME TIME FOR A FEW SECOND THOUGHTS 
WHAT I FORGOT ABOUT WAS THIS WONDERFUL CHOPPED AND SMOKED LOUISIANA HAM 
WHICH THEY THINK SHOULD GO INTO A FILE GUMBO EVEN A FISH ONE 
AND I FORGOT THIS LOVELY ANDOUILLE WHICH IS A SPICY SMOKED SAUSAGE 
SO WE'LL POP THOSE IN AS WELL 
WE CAN ALSO ACTUALLY PUT THE SHELLS OF THE GUMBO CRABS IN 
TO ADD MORE FISH FLAVOUR 
AREN'T THEY A BEAUTIFUL COLOUR 
THEY'LL BE LEFT IN AS A KIND OF SIGNATURE BUT YOU WOULDN'T EAT THAT BIT 
THEN IT'S THE MAGNIFICENT SHRIMPS OR PRAWNS AS WE CALL THEM 
LOVELY FAT PLUMPTIOUS FRESH PRAWNS 
OYSTERS TAKEN OUT WITH THEIR JUICE IN THEY GO THAT'S THE OYSTERS 
THE WONDERFUL CRAB MEAT FROM THE CAJUN CRABS 
AMERICANS DON'T LIKE PARTICULARLY TO EAT SHELLS AND BONES AND SO ON 
THEN FINALLY WE HAVE OUR CRAWFISH OR CRAYFISH 
THIS IS A FEAST AND A HALF 
I'LL STIR THAT IN NOW WE'RE COOKING ON GAS AS THEY SAY 
BUT WHAT WAS IT THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE PAYING ATTENTION HAVE REALISED I HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT 
IT IS THE CRAWFISH BOUDIN NOW THIS IS SO STYLISH 
INSIDE THIS REAL SKIN IS MINCED UP CRAWFISH SPICES BREAD AND SO ON 
IT'S CLASSICALLY FRENCH MODERN COOKING RIGHT HERE IN LOUISIANA 
TO MAKE THIS DISH SUMPTUOUS AND REALLY A ROCK'N'ROLL DISH IN THEY GO 
THEY SIMMER AND POACH IN THERE FOR ABOUT ANOTHER TEN MINUTES 
THE LID GOES ON AND THE BEAT GOES ON 
AND THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE THAT WE'LL BE EATING IT 
WITH ALL THE SHRIMP OR PRAWNS AND THE CRAWFISH AND EVERYTHING 
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT ANYTHING LIKE THIS COULD NOT TASTE GOOD 
RIGHT NOW IT'S THE CHANCE FOR A 
FEW OF YOU TO PUT A QUESTION TO US 
AND PUT US ON THE SPOT EACH CALLER 
WILL GET HELP AHH EACH CALLER

THEN ADD EVENTUALLY A BIT OF STOCK SO IT BECOMES VERY SOFT AND JUICY 
ONE MISTAKE JUST ONE NOTE THAT'S WRONG AND IT'S OVER 
THEIR HOPES AND THEIR DREAMS ARGH I CAN'T STAND IT

GARLIC SHOULD BE JUST LIKE THAT

PEPPERS AS WELL TO GIVE THE PROPER 
TASTE

THAT'S IT THE BALSAMIC VINEGAR IS SLIGHTLY SWEET 
YOU LOSE A LITTLE BIT OF THE BURN WITH BALSAMIC VINEGAR 
THEY DON'T LOOK FANTASTIC BECAUSE THEY ARE BURNT BUT THE TASTE OH 
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT FACT THE LOOK IS NICE OF FOOD BUT THE TASTE HAS TO BE THERE 
STUPENDO
