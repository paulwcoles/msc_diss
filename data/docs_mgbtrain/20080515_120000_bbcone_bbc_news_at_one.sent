AFTER SEVENTY TWO HOURS SOME PEOPLE ARE 
STILL BEING PULLED OUT ALIVE AS 
THE SCALE OF THE DEVASTATION 
BECOMES CLEAR FOREIGN RESCUE TEAMS 
ARE BROUGHT IN AND SURVIVORS TOLD 
OF THEIR EXPERIENCES 
SUDDENLY WE 
HEARD THIS HORRENDOUS NOISE WHICH 
YOU CAN'T DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS LIKE 
JUST A HUGE NOISE AND THE LAND 
SHAKING UNDERNEATH YOU 
I HAVE DONE IT BEFORE I CAN DO IT 
AGAIN GORDON BROWN INSISTS HE IS 
THE BEST MAN TO LEAD BRITAIN 
THROUGH TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES 
AN INQUIRY IS LAUNCHED INTO LAST 
NIGHT'S CLASHES BETWEEN RANGERS 
FANS AND RIOT POLICE AFTER THE 
CLUB'S DEFEAT IN THE UEFA CUP FINAL 
ON B. B. C. LONDON SIX YEARS ON AND 
STILL WAITING VICTIMS OF THE 
POTTERS BAR RAIL CRASH ON THEIR 
FIGHT FOR AN INQUIRY 
AND MEYER BORIS JOHNSON ANNOUNCES 
HIS OLYMPIC PRIORITY IS TO GET 
YOUNGSTERS INVOLVED IN SPORT 
MARE 
GOOD AFTERNOON THE GOVERNMENT IN 
CHINA SAYS THE EARTHQUAKE DEATH 
TOLL COULD REACH MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND 
IT HAD ISSUED A RARE PUBLIC APPEAL 
FOR RESCUE EQUIPMENT AS IT 
STRUGGLES TO COPE WITH THE EXTENT 
OF THE DISASTERS RESCUE WORKERS 
HAVE BROKEN THROUGH KEY ROADS TO 
GET TO THE EPICENTRE OF THE QUAKE 
BUT THE SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS IS NOW 
TURNING INTO THE TASK OF RECOVERING 
THE DEAD 
A YOUNG GIRL PEERS OUT FROM THE 
RUBBLE PULLED CLEAR INTO THE FIRST 
DAYLIGHT SHE HAS SEEN IN DAYS AS 
THE NUMBER OF DEAD CONTINUES TO 
GROW CROSS THE WORST HIT AREAS 
SURVIVORS ARE STILL BEING FOUND 
A CROSS THESE ARE RARE MOMENTS OF 
JOY AMID WIDESPREAD GRIEF TIME IS 
RUNNING OUT THE SCHOOLS WERE FULL 
WHEN THE EARTHQUAKE HIT HOPES THAT 
CHILDREN MIGHT BE FOUND ALIVE ARE 
TURNING TO DESPERATION AND GRIEF 
HUNDREDS ARE STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR 
CLOSE TO THE EPICENTRE RELIEF 
TEAMS ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO GET 
THROUGH THIS BRIDGE IS TYPICAL OF 
ROUTES INTO WENCHUAN COUNTY 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THOSE CUT OFF 
TODAY ANOTHER SCARE POWERFUL 
AFTERSHOCK IMPASSABLE BUT SOME 
ARE GETTING OUT AMONG THEM NINETEEN 
BRITISH TOURISTS MISSING BEFORE 
NOW AIRLIFTED TO SAFETY FROM A 
PANDA RESERVE 
SUDDENLY WE HEARD A 
HORRENDOUS NOISE YOU CAN'T 
DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS LIKE JUST A 
HUGE NOISE AND THE LAND SHAKING 
UNDERNEATH YOU THE FIRST THING 
THAT WE ALL THOUGHT TO DO WAS TO 
RUN 
BEHIND THEM THEY LEAVE SCENES RUN OF TRAGEDY AND DEVASTATION ALL 
AWARE THAT THEY ARE AMONG THE LUCKY 
FEW IN A DISASTER ON A HUGE SCALE 
FOR THE LATEST LET'S SPEAK TO DAN 
GRIFFITHS WHO IS IN DUJIANGYAN 
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SUCCESS 
STORIES THOUGH VERY FEW IT IS A 
CRITICAL TIME FOR RECOVERY AND 
RESCUE OF PEOPLE WHO MAY JUST STILL 
BE ALIVE DAN 
ABSOLUTELY RESCUE 
WORKERS HERE SAY THEY ARE GOING TO 
WORK AROUND THE CLOCK TWENTY FOUR HOURS A 
DAY TO TRY TO GET ANYONE WHO MIGHT 
BE ALIVE OUT OF THE WRECKAGE AFTER 
THIS EARTHQUAKE BUT THE REALITY IS 
THAT THEY HAVE EVEN SAID TO US THEY 
NOW THINK THAT FINDING MANY MORE 
PEOPLE ALIVE WOULD BE NOTHING SHORT 
OF THE MIRACLE 
STILL APPEALS 
THOUGH FOR HELP FROM THE CHINESE 
AUTHORITIES HOW ARE THEY COPING I I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT THE SCALE 
OF THIS DISASTER IS STILL UNFOLDING 
BEFORE THEIR EYES THE CASUALTY 
NUMBERS RISING BY THOUSANDS EVERY 
SINGLE DAY THEY SAY THEY NEED MORE 
HELP THEY SAY THEMSELVES THAT THEY 
ARE GOING TO COMMIT MORE AID MORE 
SOLDIERS AND MORE MONEY TO THIS 
EFFORT BUT THIS IS CLEARLY NOW A 
MASSIVE TEST FOR THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT 
THANK YOU GOVERNMENT THE EARTHQUAKE ZONE IS OF COURSE 
MOUNTAINOUS MANY ROADS ARE BLOCKED 
LET'S FIND OUT MORE AS TO HOW THE 
CHINESE ARE RESPONDING TO THIS 
ENORMOUS CHALLENGE 
THE CHALLENGE OF THIS AID AND 
RESCUE MISSION IS COLOSSAL ABOUT 
TEN MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS SICHUAN 
PROVINCE HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY 
AFFECTED THE EPICENTRE OF THE 
EARTHQUAKE WAS IN A MOUNTAINOUS 
REGION BUT CLOSE TO A SERIES OF 
TOWNS WHICH HAD BEEN CUT OFF WITH 
ROADS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
DESTROYED THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES 
ARE POURING IN HUGE RESOURCES 
EIGHTY THOUSAND TROOPS ARE NOW COMMITTED AND 
THIRTY THOUSAND EXTRA HAVE BEEN ORDERED HIM 
A NATION OF OVER A BILLION PEOPLE 
HAS PLENTY OF MANPOWER TO CHANNEL 
INTO THE WORK 
TO REACH THE REMOTEST AREAS 
SOLDIERS ARE PARACHUTING IN THESE 
ARE BEING DROPPED OVER MAOXIAN 
COUNTY THEIR ORDERS TO SET UP A 
COMMUNICATIONS CENTRE VITALLY 
NEEDED IN A REGION WHERE MOST 
CONVENTIONAL LINES ARE DOWN IT IS 
PART OF A MASSIVE MILITARY RESPONSE 
CHINA'S DEFENCE MINISTRY SAYS OVER 
ONE HUNDRED EXTRA HELICOPTERS ARE BEING 
DEPLOYED AS WELL AS PARATROOPERS 
AID PACKAGES ARE NOW BEING DROPPED 
TOO NOT ALWAYS THE MOST EFFECTIVE 
WAY OF REACHING THE VICTIMS IN 
REMOTE AREAS BUT HERE AT LEAST 
VILLAGERS CAN BE SEEN RUNNING 
TOWARDS THE DROP ZONE TO WHICH 
SUPPLIES OF CLEAN WATER AND FOOD 
TO REACH SUPPLIES THIS IS WHY SO 
MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CUT OFF 
ROADS SIMPLY TORN UP BY THE SHAKING 
OF THE EARTH ARE IMPASSABLE 
INTERNATIONAL AID AGENCIES SAY THE 
FULL SCALE OF THE DISASTER IS STILL 
UNKNOWN 
THE CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS UNKNOWN WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW BIG THIS IS 
GOING TO BE SICHUAN IS ONE OF THE 
MOST POPULOUS PROVINCES IN CHINA 
AND ONE OF THE POORER ONES WE 
THINK WE ARE QUITE FEARFUL THIS 
WILL GET A LOT BIGGER 
CHINA IS 
ACCEPTING AID FROM MANY SOURCES 
TAIWAN IS SENDING SUPPLIES IN A 
RARE DIRECT FLIGHT ACROSS THE 
TAIWAN STRAIT SHARP POLITICAL 
DIFFERENCES OVER TAIWAN'S STATUS 
CHINA CLAIMS THE TERRITORY BUT THE 
SIDE NO ONE DOUBTS THAT THE SCALE 
OF EIGHT AND RESCUE IN CHINA WOULD 
HAVE TO MATCH THE SCALE OF THE 
EARTHQUAKE AND THE TERRIBLE 
DISRUPTION DESTRUCTION IT CAUSED 
FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING 
BRITAIN HAVE COMMENDED CHINA'S 
RESPONSE AS THE COUNTRY AND OUTSIDE 
WORLD ASSESS THE DAUNTING TASK 
AHEAD AHEAD YOU CAN STAY UP TO DATE WITH THE 
LATEST ON THE SITUATION BY GOING TO 
THE WEBSITE 
HERE GORDON BROWN HAS INSISTED 
BRITAIN IS IN GOOD SHAPE TO DEAL 
WITH GLOBAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND 
HAS DENIED BREACHING HIS OWN RULES 
BY BORROWING TO ZERO POINT SEVEN BILLION TO 
FUND TAX CUT SPEAKING TO NICK 
ROBINSON THE PRIME MINISTER 
INSISTED HE IS BEST PLACED TO LEAD 
BRITAIN THROUGH THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC 
DOWNTURN DOWNTURN WE ARE TRYING TO STEER THE ECONOMY 
THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES L. BELIEVE 
THAT THE TOUGH DECISIONS WE MAKE 
FOR EXAMPLE ON PUBLIC SECTOR PAY 
WILL HELP US BUT I AM NOT GOING TO 
PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHAT I 
WILL SAY IS THAT WE ARE TAKING ALL 
THE ACTION THAT IS NECESSARY TO TRY 
AND STEER BRITAIN THROUGH THESE 
TIMES WHICH ARE PRODUCING WHAT 
PEOPLE THINK IS A RECESSION IN 
AMERICA BUT WE ARE TAKING ACTION 
ON THE HOUSING MARKET ON FUEL 
PRICES WITH HELP WITH FUEL BILLS 
AND TO GET MORE FUNDS TO BUSINESS 
THESE ARE DIFFICULT TIMES MAINLY 
INTERNATIONAL FACTORS CAUSING THIS 
EVERY OTHER COUNTRY BEING AFFECTED 
I WILL DO MY BEST TO STEER THE 
ECONOMY AS WELL AS I CAN 
LET ME 
ASK YOU ABOUT YOU WOULD YOU BE 
PREPARED TO STAND ASIDE IF YOU 
BELIEVED THE ONLY WAY FOR LABOUR TO 
WIN THE NEXT ELECTION WAS UNDER 
ANOTHER LEADER 
I SHOULD CONTINUE 
TO DO THE JOB I AM DOING 
BUT IF 
YOU FELT IN YOUR HEART I CANNOT 
WIN 
I WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE JOB WIN I AM DOING 
FORGIVE ME DO YOU 
THINK YOU CAN WIN IF SO WHY WHAT 
IS IT YOU CAN SEE THAT CANDIDLY A 
LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T SEE AT THE 
MOMENT 
I HAVE TAKEN THE BRITISH MOMENT ECONOMY THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES IN 
THE PAST THE BACKGROUND TO WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IS PEOPLE'S FRUSTRATION 
ABOUT RISING FOOD BILLS AND RISING 
COSTS AT THE SUPERMARKET AND RISING 
PETROL PRICES THAT IS HAPPENING 
AROUND THE WORLD WE HAVE TO STEER 
THE ECONOMY THROUGH DIFFERENT 
DIFFICULT TIMES AS DUP YOUR 
ANALYSIS SEEMS TO BE THAT THE 
FRUSTRATION OF THE ELECTORATE IS 
NOT WITH YOU BUT WITH THE ECONOMY 
THEY ARE BOUND TO BE FRUSTRATED 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT WHEN PEOPLE SEE 
SOMETHING THEY DID NOT EXPECT IS 
HAPPENING WE HAVE HUGE OIL PRICE 
RISES AND FOOD PRICE RISES 
HAPPENING INTERNATIONALLY L. HAVE 
TO HELP DEAL WITH THEM L. BELIEVE 
WE CAN STEER THE ECONOMY THROUGH 
DIFFICULT TIMES AS WE HAVE IN THE 
PAST PAST JAMES LANDALE IS AT DOWNING STREET 
AFTER THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS 
CONFERENCE EARLIER JUST HOW TOUGH 
IS THE PRIME MINISTER FINDING IT 
CONVINCING PEOPLE HE IS THE 
SOLUTION NOT THE PROBLEM 
WE ARE 
NOW IN A HOLDING PATTERN I THINK 
THE PRIME MINISTER BEGAN THIS WEEK 
VERY MUCH ON HIS KNEES WE HAVE NOW 
SEEN HIM PLAY ALL HIS CARDS 
EARLIER WE HAD THE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION 
TAX CUT TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THE 
PROBLEM OVER THE TEN P. TAX BAND 
ABOLITION YESTERDAY WE HAD 
LEGISLATION SET OUT IN A PRE 
QUEEN'S SPEECH TODAY HE IS 
BOMBARDING US WITH INTERVIEWS NEWS 
CONFERENCES ESSENTIALLY GETTING 
HIS MESSAGE OUT IT CAN BE SUMMED 
UP IN ONE WORD I AM DOING THE JOB 
GETTING ON WITH THE JOB THE 
QUESTION NOW IS WHAT IMPACT THAT 
HAS ON THE BY ELECTION NEXT WEEK 
AND IN THE LONGER TERM AS VOTERS 
THINK ABOUT WHETHER HE SHOULD CARRY 
ON LEADING THE GOVERNMENT 
THE NUMBER OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY 
GIRLS IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAS GONE 
UP BY A QUARTER IN TWO YEARS THE 
YOUTH JUSTICE BOARD SAYS THEY 
INCLUDE VIOLENCE AND ROBBERY BUT 
ALSO LESS SERIOUS OFFENCES LIKE A 
PLAYGROUND FIGHTS AND SHOPLIFTING 
LIKE PLAYGROUND FIGHTS 
IT IS NO LONGER JUST YOUNG MEN WHO 
ARE BEHAVING BADLY GROWING NUMBERS 
OF GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN ARE 
BREAKING THE LAW TOO NEW DATA ON 
YOUTH CRIME SHOWS THAT WHILE 
DEFENDING BY BOYS IS DOWN TWO PER CENT ON 
THREE YEARS AGO OFFENCES COMMITTED 
BY GIRLS IN THE SAME PERIOD ARE UP 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT LEANNE DEGALE TURNED HER LIFE 
AROUND AFTER BEING PUT ON YOUTH 
OFFENDING SCHEME FOR ASSAULTING 
ANOTHER GIRL WHEN SHE 
WAS FIFTEEN IT IT WAS MY FIRST OFFENCE L. HAD NEVER 
BEEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE 
BEFORE I WAS NOT BROUGHT UP TO BE 
AROUND CRIME L. FELT DEVASTATED IT IT IS NOT JUST DRINK FUELLED VIOLENCE 
AND YOBBISH BEHAVIOUR THAT IS ON 
THE RISE TO STOP LIKE MANY TOWNS 
AND CITIES CHELMSFORD IS SEEING A 
GROWING PROBLEM WITH YOUNG GIRLS 
SHOPLIFTING 
IN THE PAST WE HAVE SHOPLIFTING NOT SEEN GIRLS BEING SIGNIFICANTLY 
INVOLVED IN CRIME RECENTLY WE 
HAVE THEY ARE STEALING THINGS LIKE 
COSMETICS AND MAKE UP WHICH ARE 
VERY EASY TO STEAL 
DESPITE THE 
FIGURES YOUNG PEOPLE OF EITHER SEX 
OUT ON THE STREETS OF THE U. K. ARE 
FAR LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT A CRIME 
THAN THEY ARE TO BE A VICTIM OF ONE 
AND THAT IS WHY THE HOME SECRETARY 
IS EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THE 
BRITISH CRIME SURVEY SO THAT BY 
INCLUDING FOR THE FIRST TIME THE 
EXPERIENCES OF THE UNDER SIXTEEN SHE 
HOPES TO MAKE THEM SAFER UNDER 
SIXTEENS 
THERE IS MORE WE CAN DO TO SIXTEENS PROTECT YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO MAKE 
SURE WHERE THEY DO COMMIT CRIME 
WE TAKE TOUGH ACTION 
THERE IS 
EVIDENCE THE POLICE ARE MORE 
WILLING TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST 
GIRLS EVEN FOR MINOR OFFENCES LIKE 
PLAYGROUND FIGHTS 
A NINETEEN YEAR OLD MAN HAS APPEARED IN 
COURT CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF 
TEENAGER JIMMY MIZEN JIMMY WHO 
WAS SIXTEEN DIED FOLLOWING AN ATTACK IN 
A BAKERY IN LEE IN SOUTH LONDON ON 
SATURDAY JAKE FAHRI WAS REMANDED 
IN CUSTODY BY SUTTON MAGISTRATES 
UNTIL AUGUST THE 
THE BURMESE MILITARY GOVERNMENT HAS 
BEEN ACCUSED OF PREPARING TO TURN A 
DEAF EAR TO THE VICTIMS OF CYCLONE 
NARGIS SOME INTERNATIONAL AID HAS 
NOW ARRIVED BUT FOREIGN WORKERS 
HAVE BEEN TURNED AWAY FROM THE 
STRICKEN IRRAWADDY DELTA THERE ARE 
CONCERNS THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE COULD BE FACING FAMINE 
THE B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM REPORTING IN 
BURMA BUT OUR CORRESPONDENT SENT 
THIS REPORT 
IT IS STILL RAINING IN IRRAWADDY 
DELTA MORE THAN TEN DAYS SINCE THE 
CYCLONE HIT THIS 
STILL 
CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE OUTSIDE 
WORLD AID WORKERS ARE NOT ALLOWED 
HERE THESE ARE IMAGES THAT BURMA'S 
GENERALS DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE 
WRECKAGE AND BODIES EVERYWHERE L. 
HAVE COUNTED ONE HUNDRED SEVEN AND NOW I HAVE 
LOST COUNT OF THE BODIES WE HAVE 
PASSED THEY ARE EVERYWHERE ALONG 
THE RIVER ACTUALLY EVEN MORE 
TERRIFYING THAN SEEING THAT IS TO 
THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH 
THE SURVIVORS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE ARE STRANDED IN THE VILLAGES 
ALONGSIDE THIS RIVER AND THEY ARE 
GETTING NO HELP AT ALL AMID WHAT 
IS LEFT OF THIS VILLAGE WE FOUND 
TWENTY PEOPLE WAITING ALL LIVING IN 
THE ONLY HOUSE THAT STILL STANDS 
THEY HAVE NO FRESH WATER AND NO 
FOOD APART FROM A LITTLE RICE 
WE ARE STARVING THIS WOMAN TOLD ME 
FOR A FEW DAYS GOVERNMENT 
HELICOPTERS FLEW OVER US WE WAVED 
AND SHOUTED BUT NOTHING HAPPENED 
SHE SAYS ACROSS THE DELTA 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE 
IN THE SAME POSITION ISOLATED AND 
DESPERATE FOR AID THAT THEY ARE 
SIMPLY NOT GETTING 
POLICE IN MANCHESTER SAY THEY WERE 
SICKENED AND DISAPPOINTED AT THE 
VIOLENCE WHICH FLARED AFTER THE 
UEFA CUP FINAL BETWEEN RANGERS AND 
ZENIT SAINT PETERSBURG FORTY TWO PEOPLE WERE 
ARRESTED THERE HAS BEEN CRITICISM 
THAT FANS WERE ALLOWED TO DRINK ALL 
DAY BEFORE THE KICK OFF OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IS IN MANCHESTER WITH 
MORE FOR US 
THE STAINS IN THIS 
FANS AREA EXPLAIN WHY THERE IS SUCH 
A SMELL THERE ARE BEER AND BLOOD 
MARKS ALL OVER THE PAVEMENTS THE 
RUBBISH HAS BEEN CLEARED AWAY BUT 
THE VIOLENCE HAS TARNISHED THIS 
CITY IT ALL STARTED WHEN ONE OF 
THE BIG SCREENS TRANSMITTING THE 
MATCH BROKE DOWN 
THIS IS THE KIND 
OF PARTY MANCHESTER DIDN'T WANT TO 
HOST AROUND TWO HUNDRED ANGRY PEOPLE 
CHARGED POLICE THROUGH THE CITY 
CENTRE THEY ARE THROWING ANYTHING 
THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON OUT 
NUMBERS AND IN RETREAT ONE OFFICER 
FALLS TO THE GROUND AND IS ATTACKED 
THEY WANT TO TAKE THEIR FRUSTRATION 
OUT ON SOMETHING IT WAS OBVIOUSLY 
GOING TO BE MY OFFICER IT'S THE 
FOOTAGE OF THEM TWO HUNDRED OF THEM 
RUNNING AFTER SIX OFFICERS TRIPPING 
ONE UP AND JUMPING ON HIM LIKE A 
PACK OF WOLVES IT'S SICKENING L. 
CAN NOT SAY IT'S ACCEPTABLE NO 
MATTER HOW FRUSTRATED OR UPSET THEY 
WERE WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE 
BIG SCREEN 
THE TECHNICIANS WHO 
TRIED TO FIX IT WERE PELTED WITH 
BOTTLES AND HAD TO WITHDRAW WE DID 
HAVE A CONTINGENCEY PLAN THAT WAS 
TO PUT UP IMMEDIATELY ANOTHER 
SCREEN AT THE VELODROME AND TO BUS 
PEOPLE WITH A BLUE LIGHT ESCORT OUT 
TO THAT STREET 
BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH SOME FANS 
STAYED BEHIND AND THAT IS WHEN THE 
TROUBLE STARTED AND CONTINUED FOR 
AROUND FIVE HOURS THEN THIS 
MORNING RECOVERY AND REFLECTION 
SOME RANGERS FANS BLAME THE COUNCIL 
AND THE POLICE FOR THEIR LIGHT 
TOUCH APPROACH TO ALLOW PUBLIC 
GUYS IN THERE HAD BEEN DRINKING DRINKING FOR TEN HOURS WHAT ARE 
YOU GOING TO DO WHEN THE GAME GETSS 
PUT UP IT 
DESPITE THE VIOLENCE GREATER 
MANCHESTER BELIEVE IT WAS A SUCCESS 
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT'S MARRED 
THEIR REPUTATION FOR WHEN UNITED 
FANS GO TO MOSCOW ON 
TWENTY FIRST ONE 
THING THEY HAVE DECIDED IS THEY ARE 
NOT GOING TO TRANSMIT THE MATCH 
HERE IN THE CENTRE CENTRE 
CITY CENTRE 
THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES SAY THE 
EARTHQUAKE DEATH TOLL MAY REACH 
FIFTY THOUSAND THEY HAVE APPEALED FOR MORE 
HELP HELP COMING UP MAKING AMENDS THE 
TEENAGER WHO IS WALKING HIS WAY 
BACK TO PEACE OF MIND LATER ON B. B. C. 
LONDON PASSING ON A TIP WHY 
RESTAURANT STAFF WHO ARE SHORT 
CHANGED BY BOSSES COULD BENEFIT 
FROM A NEW CODE OF CONDUCT AND 
WATFORD'S PREMIER LEAGUE DREAM IS 
OVER AS THEY'RE HUMBLED BY THEIR 
PROMOTION 
NOW IT CAN BE THE CAUSE OF A LOT 
OF FRICTION IN THE WORKPLACE WITH 
COMPLAINTS ABOUT COLLEAGUES GETTING 
SPECIAL TREATMENT NOW THE LAW 
ALLOWING PARENTS TO ASK FOR 
FLEXIBLE WORKING HAS BEEN EXTEND SO 
THAT PARENTS OF CHILDREN UNDER SIXTEEN 
CAN ASK EMPLOYERS TO TAKE THEIR 
CIRCUMSTANCES INTO ACCOUNT 
WORKING NINE TO FIVE IS NO LONGER 
HOW MANY OF US MAKE A LIVING FOURTEEN 
MILLION WORKERS IN BRITAIN NOW HAVE 
FLEXIBLE HOURS JOB SHARE 
COMPRESSED HOUR WORK PART TIME 
WELL DONE KEEP THE GOOD JOB GOING 
JENNI FRANCIS IS CUSTOMER 
SERVICES ADVISOR BUT SHE IS ALSO A 
MUM NEEDING TO PICK HER SON UP 
FROM SCHOOL SO IT'S AGREED SHE 
WORKS NINE HUNDRED A M. UNTIL TWO THIRTY P. M. 
IF I 
DIDN'T GET THESE HOURS I WOULD BE 
ON BENEFIT AND DOING NOTHING 
WITH THESE HOURS I CAN COME INTO 
WORK AND HAVE TIME IN THE EVENING 
TO SPEND WITH MY SON 
YOU ALREADY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK 
TO WORK FLEXIBLE IF YOUR CHILDREN 
ARE UNDER SIX AS PARENTS KNOW 
SUPPORTING CHILDREN THROUGH TEENAGE 
YEARS AT SECONDARY SCHOOL CAN ALSO 
BE TRICKY TO PARENTS UP TO THE AGE 
OF SIXTEEN WILL ALSO GET THE SAME RIGHTS 
IF THERE IS A GOOD BUSINESS REASON 
FIRMS CAN SAY NO TO FLEXIBLE HOURS 
RESEARCH SUGGESTS SMALL COMPANIES 
GENERALLY HAVE A BETTER RECORD FOR 
SAYING YES THAN LARGER ONES STILL 
SOME SMALL FIRMS ARE WORRIED 
ANY MANDATORY RULINGS FROM 
PARLIAMENT ARE A JOKE WHEN IT COMES 
TO TELLING EMPLOYERS WHAT THEY HAVE 
TO DO TO ACCOMMODATE EMPLOYEES 
THEY SAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT 
BUT HAVE YOU TRIED TO SAY NO TO AN 
EMPLOYEE IT'S WORSE THAN HAVING 
CHILDREN CHILDREN HAD GOOD DAY 
NINETY PER CENT OF REQUESTS FOR FLEXIBLE HOURS 
ARE AGREED BOSSES SAY THEY FIND 
WHAT IS GOOD FOR STAFF IS ALSO GOOD 
FOR BUSINESSES 
IMELDA WALSH THE AUTHOR OF THE 
REPORT JOIN US FROM CENTRAL LONDON 
SHE IS THE HUMAN RESOURCES DIRECTOR 
FOR SAINSBURY'S HOW USEFUL IS IT 
TO ASK FOR FLEXIBLE WORKING IF YOUR 
EMPLOYER IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO 
GIVE IT TO YOU 
THE POWER OF THE 
CURRENT LEGISLATION IS IT MAKES 
PEOPLE HAVE A DIALOGUE SO THE 
EMPLOYER HAS TO LISTEN TO THE 
EMPLOYEE IF THEY COME WITH A RIGHT 
TO REQUEST TO WORK DIFFERENTLY HE 
HAS TO TAKE HE OR SHE HAS TO TAKE 
THAT VIEW INTO ACCOUNT AND GIVE A 
SERIOUS REASON WHY IT'S YAY OR NAI 
OFTEN THEY WILL COMPROMISE AND 
DISCUSS DIFFERENT IDEAS TO GET THE 
OBJECTIVE IT'S POWERFUL TO GET A 
DIALOGUE GOING 
AS YOU HEARD FROM THAT REPORT IT'S 
WORSE THAN DEALING WITH CHILDREN 
SAYING NO TO EMPLOYEES CAN IT 
CAUSE RESENTMENT 
I MYSELF HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE 
OF BOTH SAYING YES TO REQUESTS TO 
WORK DIFFERENTLY AND ALSO DEALING 
WITH THE ISSUE OF SAYING NO 
NOTHING IN MY REVIEW TODAY STAYS 
THAT THE EIGHT BUSINESS GROUND 
FORCE SAYING NO SHOULD BE CHANGED 
OR DILUTED IN ANY WAY THEY STILL 
EXIST THERE WILL SOMETIMES BE GOOD 
REASONS WHY AN EMPLOYER THINKS OR 
SHE CAN'T ADOM DATE THAT REQUEST 
IT'S RIGHT WE START THINKING 
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HOW WORK IS DONE 
AND RECOGNISE THAT MEN AND WOMEN 
MAY NEED GREATER FLICKSIBILITY 
FLEXIBILITY 
THE CHILDREN WHO CARRY THE LATEST 
MOBILE PHONES AND M. P. THREE PLAYERS ARE 
BECOMING TARGETS FOR CRIMINALS ONE 
IN EIGHT HAVE HAD A GADGET STOLEN 
THEY ALL HAVE PHONES SOME OF THEM 
MORE THAN ONE FOR THESE TEENAGERS 
IN EAST LONDON THEIR MOBILE PHONES 
ARE STATUS SYMBOLS THEY KNOW THAT 
CARRYING THEM AROUND PUTS THEM AT 
RISK 
A COUPLE OF BOYS CAME UP TO RISK ME AND SHOWN ME A KNIFE AND SAID 
GIVE ME MY PHONE L. GAVE IT TO THEM 
AND THEY HIT ME IN THE FACE 
THEY USED TO JUST CARRY POCKET 
MONEY NOW YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TAKING 
MOBILE PHONES AND MP THREES WITH THEM 
MAKING THEM TARGET OF CRIME SO 
DESIGN REMEMBERS MAKING THEM LESS 
ATTRACTIVE TO THIEVES IS SURVEY 
SHOWED YOUNG PEOPLE CARRYING HOT 
PRODUCT LIKES MOBILE PHONES AND 
MP THREES BY THE TIME THEY WERE SIXTEEN NINETY TWO PER CENT 
OF THEM WERE CARRYING O. PHONE WITH 
THEM SOME WERE CARRYING ELECTRONIC 
PRODUCTS WORTH TWO HUNDRED WHEN IT CAME 
TO HAVING THEM STOLEN ONE IN EIGHT 
HAD BEEN VICTIMS 
AT THE DESIGN AGAINST CRIME 
RESEARCH CENTRE THEY HAVE CREATED A 
BIKE THAT IS NOT WORTH STEALING NOW 
THEY ARE TRYING IT WITH PHONES I I WOULD BUY THE PHONE THAT SHE 
WOULDN'T HAVE TO DIE FOR BECAUSE 
THE VALUE IS NOT IN THE HANDSET 
IT'S SOMEWHERE ELSE 
THE YT IS NOD 
TO MAKE VALUABLE PRODUCTS LESS 
VISIBLE BUT TO ENCOURAGE 
MANUFACTURE TOES MAKE STOLEN 
TECHNOLOGY WORTHLESS TO THOSE WHO 
TAKE IT 
TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN PAID TODAY TO 
CELTIC FOOTBALLING LEGEND TOMMY 
BURNS WHO DIED THIS MORNING AT THE 
AGE OF FIFTY ONE GORDON BROWN DESCRIBED 
HIM AS INSPIRATIONAL AND ONE OF THE 
NICEST PEOPLE IN FOOTBALL THE 
FORMER CELTIC MANAGER WHO WAS 
CAPPED EIGHT TIMES FOR SCOTLAND WAS 
DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER TWO YEARS AGO 
THREE YEARS AGO TEENAGER SEB GREEN 
STOLE A BOAT AND HAD TO BE RESCUE 
OFF THE DORSET COAST THE OPERATION 
IS ESTIMATE TO HAVE COST TWENTY THOUSAND 
NOW HE IS EIGHTEEN SEB HAS DECIDED TO 
MAKE AMENDS AND PAY THE MONEY BACK 
IF SAYING SORRY IS HARD WALKING IT 
IS EVEN TOUGHER BUT THAT IS WHAT 
SEB GREEN AND HIS DOG FLASH ARE 
DOING THEY LEFT DORSET THREE 
MONTHS AGO TO WALK AROUND THE COAST 
OF BRITAIN NINE HUNDRED MILES INTO THEIRY 
WE MET THEM NEAR ARBORATH HOUR IS 
IT GOING 
SO FAR SO GOOD

EXHAUSTED 
YOU COULD SAY THAT EXHAUSTED THIS IS WHY HE IS DOING IT THREE 
YEARS AGO SEB STOLE BOAT IN 
WEYMOUTH AND SPARKED A MASS YIF 
RESCUE FILMED BY THE B. B. C. THE 
RESCUE COST TWENTY THOUSAND NOW FEELING 
GUILTY HE IS DOING AN ENYEK 
SPONSORED WALK TO PAY THE MONEY 
BACK EPIC 
IT'S MY PERSONAL WAY 
OF SAYING SORRY 
THIS MUST BE THE 
LONGEST APOLOGY ANYONE HAS EVER 
DONE 
WELL I HAVE NEVER BEEN ONE DONE TO DO THINGS BY HALF L. HAVE ALWAYS 
BEEN ONE TO GO OVER THE TOP 
HOWEVER I WILL FINISH AND I AM 
GOING TO FINISH TO PROVE TO THOSE 
WHO DOUBTED ME THAT I CAN ACHIEVE 
THE MONEY SEB RAISES IS GOING TO 
THE DORSET AIR AMBULANCE HE IS 
ALSO GOING TO BE VOLUNTEERING FOR 
THE LIFE BOATS 
OBVIOUSLY SEB'S 
ACTIONS WHEN HE WAS FIFTEEN WERE 
IRRESPONSIBLE THE ACTIONS HE HAS 
TAKEN SINCE THEN TO REPAY HIS DEBT 
HAVE BEEN ADMIRABLE IT'S GRET TO 
MEET A YOUNG MAN LIKE THAT 
SEB WON'T BE HOME UNTIL CHRISTMAS 
HE IS DOING TWENTY MILES A DAY BUT 
THERE ARE FOUR THOUSAND MILES STILL TO GO 
HIS FEET HAVE SUFFERED 
MY BIGGEST BLISTER WAS THE SIZE OF 
A DIGESTIVE BISCUIT ON THE BALL OF 
MY FOOT 
FLASH HAS SPECIAL SHOES TO 
PROTECT HIS PAWS FOR THIS THE 
ULTIMATE WALKYS AND THE ULTIMATE 
APOLOGY APOLOGY GOD FOR SEB I WAS WONDERING ABOUT 
HIS POOR DOG
