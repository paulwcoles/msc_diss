BIOFUELS WILL WE BE SALVING OUR 
CONSCIOUSS BY MAKING PEOPLE IN THE 
DEVELOPING WORLD GO HUNGRY TONIGHT TONIGHT THE GOVERNMENT'S COMMITTED US TO 
GETTING AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF 
ENERGY NEEDS FROM PLANTS IT'S AN 
ATTEMPT TO STAVE OFF CLIMATE CHANGE 
BUT ALREADY PEOPLE IN THE POOR 
WORLD ARE RIOTING FOR FOOD IS THE 
PLAN A SCHEME BY THE WEST TO GET 
OFF THE HOOK BY MAKING OTHERS GO 
HUNGRY I'M ON THE CASE SAYS 
GORDON BROWN AS THE ECONOMY 
SHUDDERS BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ANY 
LONGER FIND THAT REASSURING ARE 
THE CHINESE THE SAVIOURS OF THE 
WORLD'S POOREST CONTINENT OR ARE 
THEY JUST PLUNDERING ITS RESOURCES 
FROM THE CONGO IS SPECIAL REPORT ON 
HOW THE CHINESE ARE DESCENDING ON 
AFRICA ARE THEY THE NEW 
COLONIALISTS 
GOOD EVENING IF YOU FILL UP YOUR 
CAR ANY TIME FROM MIDNIGHT A SMALL 
PART OF THE PETROL OR DIESEL WILL 
HAVE BEEN PRODUCED FROM PLANTS OR 
SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN THE 
PROPOTION OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF BIOFUEL IS 
SUPPOSED TO DOUBLE IN FIVE YEARS' 
TIME ESSENTIAL THE GOVERNMENT 
SAYS TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE BUT 
BIOFUEL IS PLANTS AND PLANTS BEING 
TURNED INTO OIL CAN'T BE PLANTS 
TURNED INTO FOOD N. A SERIES OF 
REPORTS WE ARE ASSESSING WHETHER 
THE PLANET CAN SUSTAIN ITSELF IN 
THE FACE OF GROWING DEMAND FOR ITS 
SCARCE RESOURCES 
FIRST JACKIE LONG REPORTS 
WHEN THIS CROP IS HARVESTED IT WILL 
BE BECOME A FOOD PRODUCT OR A 
BIOFUEL THE ECONOMICS OF THE 
MARKET WILL BE THE DECIDING FACTOR 
BUT ACROSS THE WORLD THERE IS NOW 
AN URGENT DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER LAND 
USE SPECIFICALLY FOR BIOFUEL 
PRODUCTION IS THE BEST USE OF 
SCARCE RESOURCES WHOO BIOFUELS 
CAME ON THE SCENE THEY PROMISED 
THE EARTH BUT NOW CRITICISM IS 
MOUNTING THAT THE SUPPOSED GREENEST 
OF FUELS IS NOT AS GREEN AS ONCE 
PAINTED PAINTED BIOFUELS FUELS PRODUCED FROM 
PLANTS CROPS OR WASTE PRODUCTS 
WERE ONCE TALKED OF AS THE FUTURE 
OF SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SOURCES 
USEFUL FOR REDUCING CARBON DIOXIDE 
EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPLANT 
TRANSPORT BUT SLOWLY THE VOICES 
BECAME THOSE OF DISSENT THEY GREW 
LOUDER IN MONTHS THE OFFICIALS 
FROM THE E. U. AND DEPARTMENT FOR 
ENVIRONMENT FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS 
HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN THAT 
BIOFUELS ARE CREATING PROBLEMS 
RATHER THAN SOLVING THEM THEN THIS 
IN MARCH SOME OF THE BIOFUELS ARE 
HOPELESS IN THE SENSE THATED IDEA 
THAT YOU CUT DOWN RAINFOREST TO 
GROW A BIOFUEL SEEMS PROFOUNDLY 
STUPID SLIGHTLY INTEMPERATE 
LANGUAGE FOR GIVE ME BUT I SEE 
THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE 
MINISTER HAVE LEFT SO MAYBE I CAN 
GET AWAY WITH IT IF I AM NOT 
DIRECTLY 
QUOTED BUT THEY ARE REAL 
PROBLEMS THE UNSUSTAINABILITY OF 
BIOFUELS BIOFUELS THE STUDSY ANALYSED IN THE AMOUNT 
SAVED BY BIOFUELS COMPARED TO THE 
AMOUNT THEY RELEASED BY CLEARING 
THE LAND IN THE FIRST PLACE ONE 
STUDY SHOWS THAT FOR OVER TEN ZERO ZERO ZERO M. 
CLEARED FOR SOYA TO MAKE BIOFUEL 
OVER SEVEN HUNDRED TONNES OF CARBON DIOXIDE 
WOULD BE RELEASED A CARBON DEBT NOT 
TO BE CANCELLED OUT FOR THREE HUNDRED YEARS 
CONVERTING RAINFOREST TO CREATE 
PALM OIL MAKES A CARBON DEBT THAT 
WILL TAKE OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS TO REPAY 
ALL THE FACTS ARE NOT IN YET 
THERE ARE ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES 
SOME SAYING THAT THEY CREATE GREAT 
CARBON SAVING SOME THAT SAY THAT 
THEY DO NOT WE HOPE THERE ARE 
DEFINITIVE STUDIES BEING DONE IN 
GERMANY GERMANY SO SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT PURSUE IT 
ALL THE EVIDENCE IS NOT IN YET WE 
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WE CAN'T 
IGNORE CLIMATE CHANGE 
AND THE GOVERNMENT'S SOMETHING IS 
THE NEW RENEWABLE TRANSPORT FUEL 
OBLIGATION THAT COMES INTO FORCE 
TOMORROW IT MEANS T. H. A T. FIVE PER CENT OF THE 
FUEL SOLD ON THE GARAGE FORECOURTS 
MUST COME FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES 
THAT IS DUE TO RISE TO FIVE PER CENT IN FIVE 
YEARS YEARS BUT THE MOVE TO SOME IS LOOKING 
ILL JUDGED ILL JUDGED IT IS DIFFICULT TO THINK OF A MORE 
DESTRUCTIVE MOVE FROM NOBLE MOTIVES 
IMAGINABLE IMAGINABLE SO THE GOVERNMENT HAVE NOT DONE IT 
FOR BAD MOTIVES BUT FOR GOOD 
MOTIVES BUT HAVE NOT SEEN IT AS 
PART OF A PACKAGE THAT YOU HAVE TO 
LOOK AT IF YOU ARE TO WERE TECT 
MORE EFFECTIVELY THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND WITH FOOD SHORTAGES AND 
SPIRALLING PRICES SPARKING RIOTS ON 
THE STREETS OF MANY COUNTRIES 
ACROSS THE WORLD THE ISSUE 
STRETCHES BEYOND THE ENVIRONMENT 
THE WORLD BANK AND THE UN HAVE 
WORNED OF THE DANGERS OF GROWING 
CORN FOR BIOFUELS WHILE PEOPLE 
GROW HUNGRY 
IT IS NOT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS 
NOT AWARE OF THE SITUATION OF 
GROWING BIOFUELS ALISTAIR DARLING 
URGED THE WORLD BANK TO SET UP A 
REVIEW INTO GLOBAL FOOD MARKETS AS 
A RESULT RUTH KELLY HAS ASKED FOR 
A REVIEW OF HER OWN ARE FOR THE 
IMPACT ON BIOFUELS SO WHY IS THE 
GOVERNMENT PRESSING AHEAD WITH THIS 
LEGISLATION AT ALL TODAY THIS WAS 
THE ANSWER THAT THE GOVERNMENT GAVE 
WE ARE CONVINCED THAT OUR REPORTING 
MECHANISM IS A WORLD LEADER WE ARE 
DOING AS MUCH IF NOT MORE IN 
REQUIRING MECHANISMS WE WILL BE 
ABLE TO PUT INTO PUBLIC DOMAIN THE 
SOURCE OF BIOFUELS AND THE 
SUSTAINABILITY AND BE ABLE TO NAME 
AND SHAME COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT 
DOING THE RIGHT THING 
JIM FITZPATRICK IS TALKING NONSENSE 
LOOKING AT THE REGULATIONS WHERE IT 
SAYS WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF PALM OIL 
YOU CAN WRITE IN UNKNOWN THIS IS 
WHAT IS HAPPENING PEOPLE DON'T 
KNOW WHERE THE BIOFUEL IS COMING 
FROM FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S DETERMINED TO BE 
SEEN TO BE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT 
THE ENVIRONMENT DESPITE THE 
CRITICISM IT IS PRESSING AHEAD WITH 
THE NEW POLICY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT 
WITH GREAT CONFIDENCE IT IS 
ALREADY ADMITTED IT MAY BE FORCED 
TO RETHINK 
EARLIER I SPOKE TO THE UN'S SPECIAL 
RAPPORTEUR ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD 
STKPEEING JEAN ZIEGLER I ASKED 
HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE NEW 
REQUIREMENT ACTIVE FROM TOMORROW 
THAT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF ROAD FUEL SHOULD COME 
FROM PLANTS 
I AM TOTALLY DEPOSED TO THE 
DIRECTIVE FROM THE EUROPEAN YUEN 
TO THE POLICY OF PRESIDENT BUSH AND 
PRESIDENT LULA IN BRAZIL TO TAKE 
THE TWO BIGGEST BIOETHANOL 
PRODUCERS IN THE WORLD L. CAN'T 
UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT OF 
PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SAYS TWO THINGS 
HE SAID I WANT TO GET RID OF THE 
IMPORTED PETROLEUM FROM THE MIDDLE 
EAST I WANT TO IN STALL 
HE SAYS HE WANTS TO FIGHT THE 
CLIMATE ARGUMENTS BUT LOOKING AT 
THE SITUATION OF THE WORLD THE 
PEOPLE DYING THE CHILDREN THE MEN 
THE WOMEN THEN IT IS A CRIME 
IF WE MANAGE THE WORLD PLANT 
RESOURCES BETTER WE COULD DO BOTH 
THINGS PROVIDE FOOD AND FUEL YES YES THERE IS ANOTHER SOLUTION L. ASKED 
BEFORE A TWAUK THE YUEN NIGHTED 
NATIONS AND BEFORE THE COUNCIL OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS THAT SCIENCE IS 
DEVELOPING QUICKLY IT WILL BE 
POSSIBLE I ASKED FOR THE MORETORY 
FOR FIVE YEARS AND AS OF TODAY IN 
THIS MOMENT WHERE THE PRICES OF 
RICE WENT UP FIFTY THREE PER CENT IN TWO MONTHS 
THE PRICES OF CEREALS WENT UP 
EIGHTY THREE PER CENT 
BUT JEAN ZIEGLER WE DON'T EIGHTY THREE PER CENT HAVE THAT TIME CLIMATE CHANGE IS 
AN YOU ARE GENT IMPERATIVE THAT 
MUST BE A DRESSED PEOPLE MAY BE 
GOING HUNGRY NOW BUT THEY COULD 
STARVE BY CLIMATE CHANGE SOMETHING 
MUST BE DONE WHAT IS THE 
ALTERNATIVE 
THE ALTERNATIVE NOW IS ALTERNATIVE TO BRING DOWN THE NUMBER OF JEAN JEAN ZIEGLER DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE 
POSITION OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 
FOR EXAMPLE WHICH SAYS 
SIMULTANEITY THAT IT IS WORRIED 
ABOUT THE WORLD FOOD PIRATESS 
PRICES AND WORLD HUNGER WHILE BEING 
IN FAVOUR OF THE USE OF BIOFUELS 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT POSITION NO NO I WAS IN LONDON ONE PAYS TEN PER CENT FIFTEEN PER CENT 
OF THE FAMILY INCOME FOR FOOD IN 
COLOMBIA HONOURING HUNG AIRA IN 
BANGLADESH YOU PAY EIGHTY PER CENT TO NINETY PER CENT OF 
THE FAMILY INCOME FOR FOOD SO IN 
THIS BOTTOM POOL THEY HAVE TO PAY 
ALL OF A SUDDEN TRIM OR MORE EVEN 
THE PRICES FOR THE FOOD THEY HAVE 
TO SURVIVE ONE DAY MORE THE NEXT 
DAY THEN THE CAT AS STROIF IS 
COMPLETE YOU CANNOT THEN THE CAT 
AS TROPHY IS COMPLETE 
STPHR 
SO THIS IS A NONSENSE TO SAY STPHR THAT YOU BELIEVE IN BOTH OF THESE 
THINGS 
NO L. DON'T THINK IT IS THINGS POSSIBLE POSSIBLE JEAN ZIEGLER THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOR JOINING US 
TOMORROW WE ARE CONTINUING OUR 
UNSUSTAINABLE WORD SERIES WITH A 
SPECIAL PROGRAMME ON THE RISING 
COST OF FOOD ON WEDNESDAY WE WILL 
HEAR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF 
SAINSBURY'S VISION FOR SUSTAINABLE 
SUPERMARKET SHOPPING 
WHEN OUR GOVERNMENT JUMPS ON THE 
BANDWAGON OF AN APPARENTLY SIMPLE 
SOLUTION FORGETTING THE ISSUES 
ADDRESSED AND IGNORING THE EVIDENCE 
WE HAVE CAUSE TO BE CONCERNED 
YOU CAN LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK 
ON OUR WEBSITE 
TELL IT NOT IN GATH PROCLAIM IT 
NOT ON THE STREETS OF ASHKELON BUT 
THE ECONOMY SAFE IN GORDON BROWN 
SHANDS NOW IN TROUBLE 
THE POLLS SHOW PLUMMETING LEVELS OF 
CONFIDENCE IN HIS MANAGING SKILLS 
DOWNING STREET INSISTS HE IS 
ENTIRELY FOCUSED ON THE ECONOMY 
BUT WHAT IS HE ACTUALLY DOING TO 
HELP TO PREVENT RECESSION WE 
HAVE THIS REPORT 
TOMORROW THE PRIME MINISTER IS TO 
SIT DOWN TO BREAKFAST WITH 
BRITAIN'S TOP BANKERS AND OVER 
BREAKFAST GENTLY SUGGEST THAT THEY 
SHOULD KICK START THE MORTGAGE 
MARKET MARKET THEY WILL GENTLY SUGGEST TO HIM 
OVER THE COLD TOAST THAT THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND NEEDS TO PUMP A LOT MORE 
MONEY INTO THE BANKING SYSTEM AND 
FAST FAST TO THOSE NO INVITED TO GORDON 
BROWN'S BREAKFAST TOMORROW THERE 
ARE TWO PRESSING QUESTION IS THE 
BRITISH ECONOMY REALLY IN A BETTER 
STATE THAN ALL THE REST TO SURVIVE 
THE COMING DOWNTURN DO PEOPLE 
STILL TRUST GORDON BROWN AND HIS 
TEAM TO MANAGE THE ECONOMY THROUGH 
THE CRISIS APPALLED BY THE 
FINANCIAL TIMES IT SHOWED SIXTY EIGHT PER CENT OF 
THE BRITISH PUBLIC HAD NO 
CONFIDENCE AT ALL IN THE 
GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO HANDLE THE 
CREDIT CRISIS THAT WAS THE WORST 
SCORE SCORE BUT THE SAME POLL SHOWED TWENTY PER CENT FOR 
THE CREDIT CRISIS HAD IMPACT ON THE 
LIFES SO FAR 
FOR THE SHADOW CABINET IT WAS THE 
CHANCE TO STICK THE KNIFE INTO THE 
GOVERNMENT ON ECONOMIC INCOMPETENCE 
GORDON BROWN RESTED HIS REPUTATION 
ON A THREE PILLARED ECONOMIC 
STRATEGY HE SAID HE SHOULD BE 
JUDGED AGAINST ITS SUCCESS AND THE 
THREE PILLARS WERE STABILITY 
PRUDENCE AND PRODUCTIVITY 
AND FOR A WHILE THE REMARKABLE 
PERIOD OF LOW INFLATION AND GLOBAL 
GROWTH DRIVEN BY THE EMERGENCE OF 
CHINA AND INDIA MASKED THE CRACKS 
YET NOW AS GLOBAL GROWTH SLOWS AND 
INFLATIONARY PRESSURES GROW WE CAN 
SEE HOW EACH PILLAR OF GORDON 
BROWN'S FRAMEWORK IS NOW BROKEN 
HERE'S WHAT THE BRITISH ECONOMY 
USED TO LOOK LIKE IT HAD 
STRUCTURAL PROBLEM WITH HIGH 
INFLATION POLITICIANS WERE PRONE 
TO UNLEASHING BOOM AND BUST AND THE 
HOUSING MARKET WAS LIKE A 
ROLLERCOASTER GORDON BROWN'S 
ECONOMIC POLICY SEEMED TO CURE 
THESE PROBLEMS NOW SOME ARE NOT 
SO SURE 
THE GORDON BROWN MODEL FOR 
GROWTH HAS DEPENDED REALLY ON THREE 
THINGS IT'S DEPEND ODD CONSUMER 
BORROWING DEPENDENT ON HOUSING 
BORROWING AND GOVERNMENT BORROWING 
ALL THESE THINGS HAVE HELPED KEEP 
THE ECONOMY GOING WHEN OTHER THINGS 
HAVE FAULTERED LIKE FAULTERED 
LIKE EXPORTS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO 
HAVE A LONG PERIOD OF UNINTERRUPTED 
GROWTH BUT WHAT'S BREAKING DOWN 
NOW IS THAT THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN 
PUSHED TOO FAR 
OPINION POLLS TELL US THAT WHAT 
PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT RIGHT NOW WHEN 
THEY WORRY ABOUT THE ECONOMY ARE 
RISING PRICES FOR ENERGY AND FOR 
FOOD AND GORDON BROWN'S POLITICAL 
INSTINCTS TELL HIM THEY'RE RIGHT TO 
WORRY THEY TELL HIM TO BEAR DOWN 
ON INFLATION TO AVOID RAPID EASING 
OF MONETARY POLICY BUT THE LONGER 
HE DOES THAT THE MORE GROWTH TAILS 
OFF AND THAT'S ONLY ONE DILEMMA 
HERE'S THE OTHER DILEMMA TO BOOST 
THE ECONOMY THE GOVERNMENT COULD 
THINK ABOUT CUTTING TAXES THIS IS 
WHAT THE AMERICANS HAVE DONE BUT 
ITS OWN FISCAL RULES DICTATE THAT 
IT SHOULD IF ANYTHING DO THE 
OPPOSITE OPPOSITE THEY'VE GOT SOME SELF IMPOSED RULES 
THAT SAY YOU MUST ONLY BORROW TO 
INVEST OVER THE CYCLE AND IF THEY 
WERE TO FOBL THOSE SELF IMPOSED 
RULES THEY'D HAVE TO BE PUTTING 
TAXES UP IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
YEARS THAT WOULD BE UNWISE AT THE 
MINUTE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S 
GOING TO HAPPEN BUT BUT THERE'S A 
RISK OF SHARP DOWNTURN AND YOU 
DON'T WANT TO BE PUTTING TAXES UP 
IN A SHARP DOWNTURN 
GORDON BROWN'S 
NEXT STOP WILL BE WASHINGTON TO 
DISCUSS GRAND STRATEGY WITH GLOBAL 
LEADERS BUT THEY DON'T ELECT HIM 
AND LABOUR BACKBENCHERS HAVE BEEN 
CALLING FOR HIM TO EMPATHISE MORE 
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO DO 
AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID TODAY 
EVERY DAY THAT I WAKE UP IT'S 
ABOUT KEEPING THIS ECONOMY MOVING 
FORWARD KEEPING STRABLT IN THE 
ECONOMY AND KEEPING GROWTH YES IT 
IS TRUE IN AMERICA THERE'S BEEN A 
LARGE NUMBER OF REPOSSESSIONS 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS RISING AND GROWTH 
IS EITHER NEGATIVE OR IT IS NOT 
HAPPENING BUT IN BRITAIN WE HAVE 
HIGHER GROWTH THAN GERMANY AND 
FRANCE HIGHER GROWTH THAN AMERICA 
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IF WE 
DO THE RIGHT THINGS 
SO WHAT COULD THE GOVERNMENT DO TO 
GET THE BANKERS LEPKD AGAIN TO EACH 
OTHER AND TO US WELL THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND STRATEGY SO FAR HAS BEEN TO 
SWAP ITS GOOD MONEY FOR THEIR 
SLIGHTLY FLAKEY MORTGAGE ASSETS 
THE CONSERVATIVES SAID TODAY A LOT 
MORE OF THAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH 
THE CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD UNDERWRITE THE 
WHOLE PROCESS 
WHAT THE TORIES ARE PROPOSING IS 
THAT THE NON PERFORMING DEBT THAT 
THE BANKS HAVE SHOULD IN EFFECT 
BE NATIONALISED IT'S ACTUALLY 
QUITE A BIZARRE PROPOSAL FOR A TORY 
POLITICIAN TO MAKE BUT IN THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK IT PROBABLY 
IS THE RIGHT ONE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH 
I'M NO FAN OF BAILING OUT BANKERS 
WHO CAN LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES 
THANK YOU I DO HAVE A PROBLEM THAT 
IF THE BANKS SITUATION GETS WORSE 
IT IMPACTS ON ON ALL OF US GORDON GORDON BROWN AND BRITAIN'S BANKERS MAY NOT 
SEEN TO EYE BUT THEY KNOW THEY'LL 
SINK OR SWIM TOGETHER SOME OLD 
ECONOMIC ORDER DOXS MAY HAVE TO BE 
SCRAMBLED IN THE PROCESS 
WE SPEAK TO THE TREASURY MINISTER 
ANGELA EAGLE SHORTLY FIRST A 
QUICK WORD WITH MICHAEL CRICK ABOUT 
SOME OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT 
GORDON BROWN IS FACING ALL THIS 
TALK ABOUT A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE 
ARE THINGS THAT BAD 
THERE IS SOME 
TALK NOT VERY MUCH OR SERIOUS 
BUT SOME TALK AMONGST ONE OR TWO 
TWO M. P.'S WHEN YOU ASK M. P.'S ABOUT 
THIS THE NAME THAT CROPS UP AGAIN 
AND AGAIN IS CHARLES CLARKE NOBODY 
IS SERIOUSLY SUGGESTING KHAERLS 
CLARKE IS A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGER 
AS ONE SAID HE WOULD HAVE TO LOSE 
FOUR STONE BEFORE THAT'S A 
POSSIBILITY BUT PEOPLE ARE SPECK 
LAIPG AS TO WHY HE'S BEEN SEEN WITH 
SO MANY M. P.'S AT WESTMINSTER DINING 
WITH THEM DRINKING WITH THEM AND 
WITH SOME QUITE UNLIKELY COMPANIONS 
NOW MR. CLARKE HIMSELF DENIES BEING 
IN PLOTS DENIES AEZ POSSIBLE 
STALKING HORSE AS I UNDERSTAND 
THERE'S BEEN SOME SPECULATION IN 
SOME OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT 
WHETHER THINGS MIGHT GET SO BAD 
UNDER MR. BROWN THAT POSSIBLY 
ABROWNITE PERSON COMES FORWARD AND 
ATTRACTS AN UNLIKELY COALITION OF 
BLAIRITES AND THE TRADITIONAL LEFT 
TO HIS OR HER UNDERSTAND WE'RE WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR THA 
IT'S PRETTY 
UNLIKELY THE RULES ARE YOU'VE GOT 
TO GET MORE THAN SEVENTY M. P.'S AND GORDON 
BROWN UNLIKE REALLY ANY OTHER 
PRIME MINISTER IN OUR LIFETIME HAS 
GOT THIS HUGE ADVANTAGE IN THAT 
THERE'S NO HEAVYWEIGHT CHALLENGER 
WAITING IN THE WINGS FOR HIS JOB 
UNDER WHEREAS IN GORDON BROWN'S 
CASE THERE IS NO REAL CREDIBLE 
ALTERNATIVE WHO OFFERS MUCH BETTER 
AND PARTICULARLY ONE WHO IS WILLING 
TO PUT FORWARD THE KIND OF VISION 
THAT CRITICS SAY HE HASN'T GOT AND AND TOMORROW MORNING'S TIMES HAS MORE 
BAD NEWS FOR HIM 
DIGBY JONES THE 
FORMER BOSS OF THE C. B. I. ACCORDING 
TO THE TIMES WHO IS NOW A TRADE 
MINISTER ONE OF THE HAS 
APPARENTLY TOLD A GROUP OF 
BUSINESSMEN IN JANUARY THAT HE 
PLANS TO LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT 
BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION BECAUSE HE 
COULDN'T SEE HIMSELF BACKING GORDON 
BROWN IN THAT ELECTION LORD JONES 
IS UNUSUAL IN THAT HE'S NEVER 
JOINED THE LABOUR PARTY 
ANGELA EAGLE THE TREASURY MINISTER 
IS HERE NOW IF YOU CAN'T KEEP IN 
THE GOVERNMENT MAN WHO DOESN'T 
EVEN HAVE POLITICAL AFFILIATION 
TO YOU YOU'RE IN TROUBLE AREN'T 
YOU 
NO I MEAN ACCORDING TO THE YOU TAO ICHLS SFOR AND I HAVE NO MORE 
KNOWLEDGE OF IT THAN YOU HAVING 
JUST READ IT WHAT DIGBY JONES WAS 
MEANT TO HAVE SAID IN PRIVATE WAS 
ACTUALLY THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE 
AROUND AS A NON PARTISAN MINISTER 
DURING A GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
HE'S AN SNURBL MAN HE'S NOT IN THE 
LABOUR PARTY 
HE SAID HE DOESN'T 
AGREE WITH THE POLICIES AND GORDON 
BROWN INVITED HIM IN 
I DON'T 
THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT L. THINK THAT HE'S SAYING THAT AS A 
NON AFFILIATED PARTY PERSON HE 
DOESN'T WANT TO BE AROUND A 
GOVERNMENT DURING A GENERAL 
ELECTION THAT COULD BE TWO YEARS 
AWAY SO I SUGGEST WE TALK ABOUT 
THE ECONOMY AND STOP WORRYING ABOUT 
THIS TITTLE TATTLE AROUND THE EDGE 
THE RESIGNATION OF A MINISTER IS 
TITTLE TATTLE 
HE HASN'T RESIGNED TITTLE TATTLE HE'S MERELY SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO 
BE IN THE GOVERNMENT DURING A 
GENERAL ELECTION THAT MAKES SENSE 
HE DOESN'T AGREE WITH YOUR POLICY 
ON NON DOM SILS 
THAT'S NOT WHAT 
HE SAID HE SAID ACTUALLY THAT HE 
HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH PEOPLE WHO 
WOULD BE AFFECTED AND HE WAS 
REPRESENTING THEIR WORRIES BACK TO 
THE GOVERNMENT WHICH IS PART OF HIS 
JOB 
LET ME LOOK AT IT ANOTHER WAY JOB WHY DO YOU THINK THE PUBLIC HAVE 
LOST CONFIDENCE IN GORDON BROWN I I DON'T THINK IT'S CLEAR THEY HAVE 
YET 
SHOW ME A POLL THAT SHOWS YET ANYTHING DIFFERENT 
WE'RE MID TERM 
JEREMY PARTIES ALWAYS SUFFER MID 
TERM BLUES IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR 
SOMETIMES THEY LOSE CONFIDENCE IN 
THE PRIME MINISTER AND THAT APPEARS 
TO BE WHAT'S HAPPENED I'M ASKING Y. 
WE HAVE HAD ONE OR TWO POLLS THAT 
HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN WE MIGHT HAVE 
WANTED AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A SIGN 
OF WORRY FOR US BUT I THINK WE 
HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE'RE 
ENTERING INTO CHOPPY ECONOMIC 
WATERS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TEN 
OR ELEVEN YEARS PEOPLE AREN'T USED 
TO WORRYING THEIR ECONOMIC 
PROSPERITY AND NATURALLY THEY ARE 
AND WE HAVE TO REASSURE THEM AND AND THEY DON'T FEEL THE PRIME MINISTER 
IS DOING ANYTHING FOR EXAMPLE 
THIS BREAKFAST TOMORROW MORNING 
WITH BANKERS IS HE GOING TO DO 
ANYTHING MORE THAN EAT A BIT OF 
MUESLI OR IS HE GOING TO DO 
ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING 
I DON'T WHAT 
KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO EAT AT THE 
BREAKFAST BUT HE'S TALKING TO 
THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL 
SERVICES IN THIS COUNTRY BEFORE HE 
GOES TO WALL STREET TO TALK TO TO 
OTHER KEY PLAYERS INTERNATIONALLY 
SO WE CAN DECIDE HOW TO DEAL WITH 
THIS GLOBAL CREDIT SQUEEZE GOING ON 
PART OF THESE DIFFICULTIES HAVE TO 
BE DEALT WITH BY INTERNATIONAL CO 
OPERATION THAT'S WHY THE 
CHANCELLOR WAS AT THE SPRING 
MEETINGS OF THE I. M. F. AND G. SEVEN WE'RE 
ALSO TAKING ACTION IN OUR DOMESTIC 
ECONOMY PUTTING LIQUIDITY BACK INTO 
THE SYSTEM WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT 
WE CAN TO HELP FULL TIME BUYERS 
THOSE WORRIED ABOUT FIRST TIME 
BUYERS THE CHANCELLOR WILL BE 
MEETING THE COUNCIL OF MORTGAGE 
LENDERS NEXT WEEK 
YOU HONEST I 
BELIEVE ALL THAT'S WORKING DO YOU 
THE KEY THING WE HAVE TO REMEMBER 
ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES AHEAD 
IS THAT THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE SOUND 
WE HAD THE FASTEST GROWTH IN THE G. 
SEVEN LAST YEAR THE I. M. F. HAVE PREDICTED 
GROWTH OF SIXTEEN WHICH IS THE FASTEST 
AGAIN IN THE G. SEVEN WE HAVE HIGH 
LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT WE HAVE GOT 
TO MAKE SURE TO THE BEST OF OUR 
ABILITY IN THE TREASURY THAT WE CAN 
STOP THIS FINANCIAL CONTEENAGEON 
FROM SPREAD CONTEENAGEON FROM 
FROM THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND IF 
WE CAN DO THAT 
THE BANKS AS YOU 
KNOW WANT TO SWAP BAD MONEY FOR 
GOOD WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS YOU 
TAKE OUR BAD DEBTS OR POTENTIALLY 
BAD DEBTS OUR MORTGAGE BOOKS AND 
GIVE US SOME GOOD MONEY IN EXCHANGE 
WHY WON'T YOU DO THAT 
THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND HAVE PUT TWENTY FIVE BILLION OF 
LIQUIDITY INTO THE SYSTEM SINCE 
LAST DECEMBER THEY ARE LOOKING 
EVEN AS WE SPEAK AT HAVING A WIRED 
RANGE OF COLLATERAL TO SWAP FOR 
SOME OF THESE DEBTS THAT POLICY IS 
ONGOING 
IT'S KNOLL LIKE ENOUGH IF ONGOING IT WERE ENOUGH THE BANKS WOULDN'T 
BE ASKING TO YOU DO T. THERE'S THERE'S ALREADY BEEN LIQUIDITY SUPPORT THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND GOVERNOR HAS SAID 
HE WILL DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO 
SUPPORT LIQUIDITY AND GET BANKING 
STRUCTURES AND THOSE MARKETS BACK 
TO NORMAL THAT IS GOING ON IN 
CONCERT WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL 
BANKS THE FED THE CANADIAN AND 
SWISS BANKING SYSTEM AND THE E. U. 
THIS IS WHAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE 
HAS BEEN DOING AND THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND HAS NOT BEEN DOING DO YOU 
NOT THINK YOU SOUND SLIGHTLY 
COMPLACENT 
NO I THINK THAT WE'RE COMPLACENT VERY FOCUSED ON THE PROBLEMS THAT 
THERE ARE IN WORLD FINANCIAL 
SYSTEMS WE HAVE TO GET THE BALANCE 
RIGHT BETWEEN ENSURING THAT WE CAN 
TRY AND NORMALISE THESE MARKETS WE 
HAVE TO STOP THIS SPREADING INTO 
THE REAL ECONOMY AND THAT'S WHY THE 
LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT THAT WE'VE GOT 
ARE SO IMPORTANT THAT'S WHY THE 
FACT THAT THE ECONOMY IS ACTUALLY 
STILL GROWING JEREMY 
YOU KNOW 
WHAT HAS TO BE DONE 
WHATEVER YOU 
SAY THE ECONOMY IS STILL GROWING 
WE HAVE TO KEEP A VERY CLOSE EYE ON 
ALL OF THESE THINGS AND ENSURE THAT 
WE CAN STEER THE ECONOMY SENSIBLY 
THROUGH THESE CHOPPY WATERS AND 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING 
THANK YOU 
NOW A ROUND UP OF TODAY'S NEWS 
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT 
ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNERS HAVE 
CLAIMED A NEW LAW THAT COMES INTO 
FORCE TOMORROW WHICH REQUIRES TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
OF ALL ROAD FUELS TO COME FROM 
BIOFUELS IS CONTRIBUTING TO 
SPIRALLING WORLD FOOD PRICES 
BRITISH OFFICIALS IN ECUADOR SAY 
THEY'RE DOING ALL THEY CAN TO FLY 
HOME SURVIVORS OF THE ROAD ACCIDENT 
IN WHICH FIVE BRITISH WOMEN DIED 
FOUR TEENAGERS AND THEIR TOUR GUIDE 
WERE KILLED WHEN A A LORRY HIT 
THEIR BUS AS IT HEADED FROM THE 
COAST TO QUITO SILVIO BERLUSCONI 
IS SET TO WIN ITALY'S GENERAL 
ELECTION WITH PROJECTED RESULTS 
SHOWING HIS COALITION ON COURSE TO 
TAKE BOTH THE LOWER HOUSE AND THE 
SENATE THE SEVENTY ONE YEAR OLD'S MAIN 
RIVAL THE CENTRE LEFT LEADER WALTER 
VELTRONI HAS CONCEDED VICTORY THE 
HIGH COURT IN ZIMBABWE HAS REJECTED 
AN ATTEMPT BY THE OPPOSITION 
MOVEMENT FOR D. A. K. CHANGE TO FORCE A THE 
I WONDER WHAT OUR ECONOMIC TROUBLES 
WOULD LOOK LIKE TO THE CHINESE 
THERE ISN'T A GOVERNMENT OR A 
COUNTRY IN THE REST OF THE WORLD 
THAT DOESN'T ENVY CHINA A RATE OF 
GROWTH PREDICTED AT EIGHT PER CENT 
THIS YEAR BUT THAT MACHINE NEEDS 
TO BE FED AND FED EVER MORE 
FEWERIESLY 
IN EXCHANGE FOR RAW MATERIALS TO 
FEED HER INDUSTRIES CHINA OFFERS 
AFRICA DEVELOPMENT RIGHT NOW 
THEY'RE ABOUT TO SIGN A MULLDY 
BILLION POUND AID FOR MINERALS DEAL 
WITH THE CONGO AND NOT EVEN THE 
CONGOLESE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IT 
AMOUNTS TO 
OUR REPORTER HAS BEEN GIVEN 
EXCLUSIVE DETAILS OF THE DETAIL AND 
BEEN TO DEMOCRATIC CONGO TO FIND 
OUT ZBLPB O. K. 
THIS SHORT RAILWAY LINE IS PROBABLY 
ONE OF VERY FEW FUNCTIONING IN THE 
STATE THE SIZE OF WESTERN EUROPE 
NO ONE'S QUITE SURE 
BUT WHAT'S CERTAIN IS THE MOST 
CONGOLESE ARE GOING NOWHERE 
AFTER A CENTURY OF FORCED LABOUR 
WAR AND WHOLESALE PILLAGING HARDLY 
ANYONE HERE AS A JOB THEY SURVIVE 
BY PETTY TRADING AND EXTRAORDINARY 
RESILIENCE 
THE WORD LIFE WE LEARN IN THE 
DICTIONARY EXISTS ONLY FOR WHITES 
HERE THE MEANING OF THAT IS WHERE 
LIFE DOESN'T EXIST 
THE CONGO'S ENDED A CIVIL WAR THAT 
KILLED FIVE MILLION AND HELD 
ELECTIONS BUT VOTING WON'T MAKE 
THE TRAINS RUN THAT CHALLENGE HAS 
BEEN OFF COUNTRY KERPB ON 
EFFICIENCY THAN DEMOCRACY 
THE CHINESE ARE COMING TO CONGO'S 
RESCUE WITH A MASSIVE PLAN 
CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT TO 
IS SO HE WALKS SEVEN KILOMETRES 
EVERY DAY AND HE HAS TO TAKE A 
READING EVERY FORTY METRES 
IT'S AN IMMENSE TASK IF YOU THINK 
THAT THIS STRETCH OF ROAD IN THE 
SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF CAT TANG GA IS 
JUST THE FIRST AND LEAST POT HOLED 
OF ALL THOSE TO BE BUILT OR REBUILT 
OVER THE NEXT TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS 
TO BE EXACT ACCORDING TO THE 
CONFIDENTIAL CONTRACT NEWSNIGHT HAS 
SEEN CHINA'S AGREED TO BUILD TWO 
TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILES OF ROAD ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILES OF 
RAILWAY THIRTY TWO HOSPITALS ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE HEALTH 
CENTRES AND TWO UNIVERSITIES 
TODAY ONE OF CREC'S BIG BOSSES HAS 
ARRIVED FROM BEIJING TO INSPECT 
PROGRESS PROGRESS HIS FIRMS GOT SOME TRACK RECORD 
THIRTY THOUSAND MILES OF RAILWAY BACK HOME 
INCLUDING THE EXTRAORDINARY ROOF OF 
THE WORLD LINE INTO TIBET KONG DPO 
HE'S SURE COULD BE TRANSFORMED 
JUST AS QUICKLY AS HIS COUNTRY WAS 
HE SAYS THIS DID SHOCK HIM WHEN HE 
ARRIVED BUT ACTUALLY HE UNDERSTANDS 
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT CHINA LOOKED 
LIKE THIRTY YEARS AGO BEFORE IT STARTED 
DEVE OPING 
DEVELOPING BUT IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THE ROADS 
THEY'RE IMPROVING FIRST LEADS TO 
THE BORDER THE CHINESE ARE 
THINKING NOT JUST OF CONGO'S NEEDS 
BUT ALSO OF WHAT THEY WANT TO BRING 
IN AND TAKE AWAY 
AS HE LOVES TO SAY IT'S A WIN WIN 
DEAL NOT AID BUT BUSINESS 
TRPBS TRANSCHINA NEED SO MANY 
THINGS THAT WE CAN'T LIVE CLOSED 
OFF FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD 
THAT'S WHY WE'VE ADOPTED A POLITICS 
OF OPENNESS TOWARDS THE OUTSIDE 
WORLD ECONOMICALLY WE JUST CAN'T 
CUT OURSELVES OFF BECAUSE RIGHT NOW 
OUR ECONOMY NEEDS EVERYTHING 
THE BENEFITS OF CO OPERATING WITH 
THE CONGO AREN'T HARD TO FIND 
THIS IS WHAT CHINA WANTS IN RETURN 
FOR ITS GRAND PROGRAMME OF PUBLIC 
WORKS COPPER AND CO BALLOT THE 
MINERALS THAT CONGO IS SO RICH IN 
THAT CHINA DESPERATELY NEEDS FOR 
ITS EVER EXPANDING INDUSTRIES 
THE CONGO HOLDS TEN PER CENT OF THE WORLD'S 
COPPER RESERVES AND AT LEAST A 
THIRD OF ITS COBALT COBALT IS 
NEEDED FOR HEAT RECITIES DIDN'T AL 
LOUS IN JET ENGINES AND FOR 
RECHARGEABLE PHONE BATTERIES CHINA 
MAKES FOUR TIMES AS MANY MANY 
MOBILES AS IT DID JUST FIVE YEARS 
AGO THE CHINESE DEMAND FOR COBALT 
HAS 
A FOURTEEN FOLD INCREASE IN TEN YEARS 
BUT MOST 
THIS ONE 
OWNED BY THE GEL BAN GROUP FOREST 
BELONG TO WESTERN FIRMS CHINA'S 
NEED FOR ITS OWN HAS GIVEN CONGO 
UNUSUAL LEVERAGE IN THE PAST THE 
CONGOLESE HAS SEEN THEIR WEALTH 
IVORY RUBBER GOLD DIAMONDS 
URANIUM AND COPPER COPPER COBALT 
BRING LITTLE BUT SLAVELY AND WAR 
THE CHINESE DEAL IF IT WORKS WILL 
BE DIFFERENT 
IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME PEOPLE 
OF CONGO 
WILL KNOW 
WHAT THE 
MINERALS OF 
CONGO WILL 
DO FOR THEM 
WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT WATER SCHOOL 
DRENGS 
ROAD HIGHWAY 
THEY HARDLY 
SEE 
THAT FROM 
THE MINERAL 
WE HAVE 
SUCH HUGE ASSETS 
THIS IS THE MAN THE GOVERNMENT TOOK 
ON TO REALISE THOSE ASSETS BY 
BARGAINING WITH CHINA A CANADIAN 
LAWYER WHOSE HOME IS IN THE TAX 
HAVEN OF MONACO NOW HEADS CONGO'S 
STATE RUN MINING COMPANY HE WAS IN 
A BEIJING HOTEL WHILE THE DEAL WAS 
WORKED OUT 
WE WERE NEGOTIATING FOR 
TWO MONTHS BOTH PARTIES WANTED TO 
ARRIVE AT A POSITIVE CONCLUSION IT 
WAS HARD WORK 
THE CHINESE STRIKE A 
HARD BARGAIN 
A GOOD BARGAIN NOT A 
HARD BARGAIN 
THE COPPER BELT 
STRETCHES HUNDREDS OF MILES UNDER 
THIS FOREST BUT THEY HAD TO FIND 
THE CHINESE A MINE 
WITH A 
KNOWN 
VALUE A BIG ONE BIG ENOUGH TO 
REPAY THE SIX MILLION OF 
INFRASTRUCTURE THEY HAVE OFFERED 
FOUR TIMES CONGO'S ANNUAL BUDGET 
HERE IT WAS THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT 
LISTS ALL THE ROADS AND HOSPITALS 
AND UNIVERSITIES CHINA WILL BUILD 
IN RETURN FOR WHAT LIES UNDER THIS 
LAKE IT IS A SIMPLE DEAL IN ITS 
CONCEPTION BUT DETAILED IN ITS 
DETAIL DETAIL HE PULLED IT OFF HIS COMPANY WILL 
FORM A 
JOINT VENTURE 
WITH THE 
CHINESE 
TO WORK THE MINE 
THERE IS 
THE 
MINOR PROBLEM 
OF ALL 
THAT WATER 
IT 
WILL TAKE 
TWO YEARS TO PUMP OUT 
THE 
CHINESE WILL PROBABLY 
SPEND 
BILLION JUST TO GET THE MINE UP AND 
RUNNING BRINGING THEIR TOTAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT TO NINE DOLLARS 
BILLION BUT THEY WILL GET TEN 
MILLION TONNES OF COPPER AND 
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TONNES OF COULD BE BATTLE 
WE HAVE 
DONE COBALT WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF INVESTIGATION SO WE KNOW 
HOW TO GO ABOUT 
MINING IT 
HOW 
DEEP IT IS THAT 
IS WHY 
WE COULD 
GIVE ENOUGH 
CONFIDENCE TO 
THE 
CHINESE PARTNER TO DISPERSE STRAIGHT AWAY THE 
DEAL IS 
NOT AS 
STRAIGHT AWAY TRANSPARENT AS MANY WOULD LIKE 
WHAT IS 
TO STOP 
THE COMIN NIECE 
PARTNER SEND COMIN NIECE PART 
CHINESE PARTNER SENDING THE MONEY 
BACK IN LABOUR 
IF THEY ARE CHEAPER 
THEY WILL GET THE 
MARKET IF 
THEY 
HAVE THE QUALITY AND THE LEAST 
EXPENSIVE YOU WILL SEE CHINESE 
TRUCKS AND 
CONTRACTORS THIS 
BUSINESS THIS IS NOT A SOCIAL 
SERVICE SERVICE THIS WAS A THRIVING JUMPING PLACE 
IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES NINETEEN THIRTIES UP TO THE 
NINETEEN NINETIES AND NOW IT LAST A SECOND 
LIFE WE ARE DAYS AWAY FROM THE 
DISPERSEMENT BY THE CHINESE 
COUNTERPART OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS 
THE PROFITS FROM THE CONGO'S FIRST 
COPPER RUSH IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND NINETEEN THIRTIES 
TURNED THE CAPITAL ELIZABETHVILLE 
INTO AN ART DECO JEWEL DEEP IN THE 
AFRICAN BUSH IT WAS SOPHISTICATION 
FOR BELGIAN AND COLONIAL FORTUNE 
HUNTERS BUT NOT FOR THE NATIVES 
THE BELGIANS LIKE THE CHINESE 
DESIGNED GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE 
THEMSE VES 
BUT IN SEVENTY FIVE YEARS THEY 
DIDN'T TRAIN ONE CONGALESE ENGINEER 
WITH THE CHINESE IT IS SUPPOSED TO 
BE DIFFERENT 
FEW OF THE ENGINEERS TAKING 
GEOLOGICAL SAMPLES HERE CAN 
COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH CONGALESE 
WORKERS BUT THE CONTRACT CALLS FOUR LOCAL WORKERS TO EVERY CHINESE 
AND HALF 
THE CASH MUST 
GO FOR 
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND TRAINING 
IT DOESN'T CALL OF COURSE FOR 
CHINESE AND CONGALESE TO LIVE 
TOGETHER TOGETHER THIS COMPOUND AN HOUR FROM TOWN 
WILL BE THE MAIN BASE FOR EXPAT 
WORKERS WHEN THE BUILDING 
MANY 
PEOPLE ALL 
TOGETHER WILL 
BE WORKING 
ON THIS ROAD THREE HUNDRED SO ALL THESE 
WORKERS HERE THE CHINESE ENGINEERS 
HOW LONG WILL THEY SPEND IN THIS 
CAMP TEN MONTHS 
CONDITIONS FOR THE YOUNG ENGINEERS 
WHO WILL LEAVE THEIR TWO 
OR THREE YEARS 
ARE SPARTAN 
THE EXTREME 
THIS IS ALL THAT 
YEAR OLD JANGJEEN LAST BROUGHT WITH 
HIM 
THE COMPANY HAS A 
POLICY OF SENDING US 
HOME EVERY 
SIX 
MONTHS 
TO A 
YEAR HOW 
DIFFICULT IS 
IT TO 
BE IN AFRICA FOR SUCH A LONG 
TIME 
WELL SPEAKING IT 
IN THE WIDER 
SENSE WE 
ARE 
FOR 
WIDER WORLD 
HARMONY I DON'T 
FIND IT DIFFICULT 
BUT THEY WORK SIX SOMETIMES SEVEN 
DAYS WEEK FORTIFIED BY LASHINGS 
OF TOFU AND MUSHROOMS BY IMPORTED 
CHEF THE 
BIG BOSS 
FOR 
CHINA IS LATE 
FOR LUNCH 
AND 
DISSATISFIED 
FOR THE 
TOUR 
DISSATISFIED FOR THE TOUR OF INSPECTION HE 
HAS FOUND 
ALL THE 
STAFF HAVE MALARIA 
TRUCKS ARE 
TAKING THREE 
OR FOUR MONTHS TO 
ARRIVE FROM 
CHINA AND 
IT IS A 
HEADACHE GETTING EVEN THE MOST 
BASIC MATERIALS TAKE TAKE CEMENT FOR EXAMPLE IT HAS TO COME 
FROM ZIMBABWE OR ZAMBIA IT IS 
MORE COMPLICATED AND IT COSTS TOO 
MUCH THEY 
CAN'T EVEN 
SUPPLY THEIR 
OWN COUNTRY'S NEEDS THAN OUR'S WE 
ARE THINKING OF 
WAYS AROUND 
POSSIBLY BUILDING 
OUR OWN 
FACTORY 
WE NEED 
AT LEAST 
TONNES OR WE WON'T 
BE 
COMPLETE THE 
WORK HERE 
BUT HE 
STILL THINKS 
THE FIRST 
OF ROAD CAN 
BE FINISHED 
BEFORE THE 
OF ROAD CAN BE FINISHED BEFORE THE RAINS IN OCTOBER 
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT BEIJING WANTS 
THROUGHOUT AFRICA THE CHINESE STATE 
WITH STATE OWNED BANKS AND OR 
STATE BUSINESSES 
WORK TOGETHER 
IN 
ONE STREAMLINED OPERATION THAT THE 
WEST WITH ITS MORE PRIVATISED 
ECONOMIES CAN'T MATCH 
IN THIS DEAL THE CHINESE BANKS AND BUSINESSES COMMIT 
FROM THE OUTSET 
TO START 
THE MINING 
AND 
BUILDING OF THE 
PUBLIC WORKS 
TO NOW I 
HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THE OTHER 
PARTNERS AREEING TO 
DO THAT 
PARTNERS AREEING TO DO THAT AGREEING TO DO THAT 
THE RETURN 
ONLY COMES 
AFTER A FEW 
YEARS ONCE THE NATURAL RESOURCES 
START FLOWING 
IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR 
US TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS AS 
YOU KNOW THE WAR HAS GONE THROUGH 
DIFFERENT SOCIAL ISSUES AND TURMOIL 
THE WAY THAT THE WESTERN WORLD 
RISKS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE CHINESE 
THE ASIAN RISK 
THE WINNERS INCLUDE THE CHINESE 
WORKERS THEMSELVES HERE THEY WILL 
EARN THREE TIMES 
WHAT THEY COULD 
AT 
HOME ENOUGH 
FOR A 
POSH 
EVEN A NEW HOUSE BACK HOME IN 
VILLAGES WHERE THEIR FAMILIES WAIT 
NERVOUSLY FOR THEIR RETURN 
MY PARENTS ARE PEASANTS THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH 
ABOUT THE WORLD OUTSIDE CHINA THEY 
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AFRICA 
THEY THINK IT IS SOMETHING TERRIBLE 
HERE 
SOME WERE DRAWN BY A SPIRIT HERE OF ADVENTURE WHY DID YOU COME TO 
AFRICA 
TO SEE THE WORLD TO AFRICA EXPERIENCE THE DIFFERENT STANDARDS 
OF LIFE IT WAS ALWAYS MY DREAM 
THE CONTRACT IS 
CERTAINLY A DREAM 
FOR 
CHINA BUT 
NOT SOMETHING 
THE CONGALESE THEY HAVE 
HAD NO 
CHANCE YET TO EXAMINE IT 
OUR WORRY IS THE DEAL IS ALMOST TOTALLY 
OPAQUE FOR TWO 
WHOLE WEEKS 
NO ONE 
EVEN KNEW 
THE DOCUMENT WE 
FOR A COPY 
WHEN WE 
DID EVENTUALLY 
GET 
HOLD OF 
ONE WE 
REALISED IT 
DIDN'T BENEFIT THE COUNTRY 
AT ALL 
DIDN'T BENEFIT THE COUNTRY AT ALL IT 
ALLOWS FOR 
A GROUP 
OF CHINESE 
GET 
MORE THAN 
THE CONGALESE IT IS 
NOT A WIN WIN CONTRACT 
THERE ARE 
SEVERAL VAGUELY WORDED PASSAGES IN 
THIS CONTRACT THAT APPEAR TO THE CHINESE 
AN EXTRAORDINARILY 
GOOD 
THE CHINESE AN EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD DEAL 
ONE FOR 
EXAMPLE 
FREES THE 
CHINESE OF THEIR JOINT 
FROM ALL 
TAXES AND CUSTOMS 
DUTIES 
UNTIL THEY 
HAVE COMPLETED 
ALL THE 
BUILDING WORK THEY HAVE PROMISED 
HOW DO 
THEY JUSTIFY THAT 
IN THE 
MINISTRY OF 
MINDS AT THIS 
STAGE WE 
ARE ENCOURAGING 
THE CHINESE TO 
INVOLVED TO BE GETTING 
THE MONEY GOING 
SO 
GETTING THE MONEY GOING SO WILL THEY PAY TAX 
IN THE 
END FOR 
US TO 
PUSH THIS 
MACHINE TO GO 
AS FAST AS 
POSSIBLE WE 
HAVE TO 
PUT WHATEVER 
POSSIBLE WE HAVE TO PUT WHATEVER INCENTIVE IS NECESSARY 
WESTERN STATES WHOSE COMPANIES 
HAVE PROFITED FROM THE CONGO LONG SAY NOTHING 
PUBLICLY AGAINST 
LONG SAY NOTHING PUBLICLY AGAINST THE CHINESE DEAL 
BUT PRIVATELY 
SOME ARE 
SMARTING 
SOME ARE SMARTING ONE DIPLOMAT TOLD ME IT WASN'T JUST QUESTION OF PRIVILEGES THE 
BEHIND THE 
DEAL 
SHOWS IT 
IS DIALATE 
ROBBERY THE BACK OF THE ENVELOPE 
CALCULATION GOES LIKE THIS THE 
JOINT VENTURE GETS TEN MILLION 
TONNES OF COPPER FORTY BILLION DOLLARS 
FORTY THOUSAND TONNES OF COBALT WORTH THIRTY TWO DOLLARS 
BILLION THE INCOME SEVENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS 
TAKE AWAY THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT 
IS NINE BILLION DOLLARS YOU ARE 
LEFT WITH 
SIXTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS 
OF INCOME 
A 
THIRD OF 
THAT GOES 
TO THE KONG GOES SIDE 
TWO THIRDS GOES 
TO THE CHINESE SIDE 
THAT IS FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS A COLOSSAL 
PROFIT PROFIT THAT IS THE NUMBER OVER AND ABOVE 
ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO HAS FORTAN 
SOLD THE 
CONGALESE SHORT 
THE PERSON 
THAT MADE YOU 
THAT 
CALCULATION 
DOESN'T KNOW 
WHAT HE IS 
TALKING ABOUT WHY YOU HAVE TO WHY FACTOR THE INTEREST RATE AND THE 
OPERATING COSTS THIS IS NOT PROFIT 
IT'S GOING TO 
BE FAR LESS 
THAN 
HOW MUCH WILL THAT COME 
DOWN ONLY 
HOW MUCH WILL THAT COME DOWN ONLY A 
THIRD OF 
THAT NUMBER 
I WOULD 
SUSPECT THERE 
WILL BE 
A LOT OF 
CASH BEING 
THROWN 
OUT BUT IT 
WON'T 
BE 
OF THIS 
MAGNITUDE OF 
NUMBERS I 
WISHED IN 
A WAY 
IT WOULD 
BE IF 
IT 
DID IT WOULD BE 
VERY GOOD 
BUT 
DID IT WOULD BE VERY GOOD BUT FOR MORE 
THE CHINESE 
WHAT CAN I DO 
IF I 
DON'T HAVE 
THE 
CHINESE THIS WOULD 
BE A 
BEAUTIFUL 
SCENERY LIKE YOU SEE OF TODAY IT 
WON'T PRODUCE 
THE WEALTH 
THAT THE 
OPERATION WILL PROVIDE 
WEALTH IS 
STILL A LONG WAY OFF FOR MOST 
CONGALESE THEIR IMPATIENCE FOR 
RESULTS HAS BROUGHT 
THE GOVERNMENT 
TO BARGAIN 
WITH CHINA IT 
IS 
TO BARGAIN WITH CHINA IT IS GOOD ON 
BALANCE THAT 
CHINESE MONEY 
GOES 
ON BALANCE THAT CHINESE MONEY GOES STRAIGHT TO CHINESE CONTRACTOR 
BYPASSING 
UNLIKE MOST 
BYPASSING UNLIKE MOST WESTERN AID THE STICKY HANDS OF LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES AUTHORITIES ON THIS TRIP ONLY SMALL PRIZES ARE 
OFFERED OFFERED THE BIG ONE GETTING CONGO MOVING 
DEPENDS ON CHINA'S EFFICIENCY BUT 
ALSO ON LETTING CONGALESE 
SCRUTINISE PROGRESS THAT WILL TAKE 
AN OPENNESS 
THAT NEITHER CHINA NOR 
THE GOVERNMENT HERE WELCOMED 
CONGO IS 
ONLY JUST 
THE 
END OF
