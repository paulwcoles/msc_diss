A THIRD OF US WOULD NOW TRUST NO 
ONE ON OUR OWN STREET WITH OUR KIDS 
FIRST OUR MAIN STORY THIS MORNING 
AT LEAST FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN 
THE CYCLONE DISASTER IN BURMA THE 
NORMALLY SECRETIVE NATION IS ASKING 
FOR HELP AS THE NUMBER OF 
CASUALTIES BECOMES CLEAR THE 
CYCLONE STRUCK AT SPEEDS OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
MILES AN HOUR TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE 
KILLED IN SINGLE TOWN THIS IS A 
COUNTRY TORN APART CYCLONE NARGIS 
HAS DEVASTATED LARGE AREAS OF 
SOUTHERN BURMA HOUSES FLATTENED 
TREES UPROOTED AND ROADS BLOCKED 
THE CYCLONE HIT BURMA AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILES 
PER HOUR SWEEPING ACROSS THE 
SOUTH WEST OF THE COUNTRY ONE 
EYEWITNESS TOLD THE B. B. C. WHAT HE SAW 
IN THE MAIN CITY OF RANGOON HUGE HUGE TREES HAD JUST FALLEN ON THE ROAD 
WINDOWS WERE SMASHED WE SAW HOUSES 
WITHOUT ANY ROOFS THERE WERE 
ELECTRICITY POLES ALL ACROSS LIKE 
ON THE ROAD ALL SERVICES HAD JUST 
SHUT DOWN THERE WERE NO TAXIS AND 
NO SHOPS AND PEOPLE WERE NOT 
REPORTING TO WORK 
HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MADE 
HOMELESS BURMA IS ALREADY 
IMPOVERISHED AND ISOLATED BUT IN A 
RARE MOVE THE AUTHORITIES HAVE 
APPEALED TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD FOR 
HELP A SIGN OF THE SCALE OF THE 
DISASTER DISASTER BUT GETTING SUPPLIES TO AREAS CUT 
OFF BY THE CYCLONE WON'T BE EASY 
AID AGENCIES WILL BRING FOOD AND 
WATER MEDICINE AND SHELTER THE 
ESSENTIAL TO HELP THESE PEOPLE 
SURVIVE SURVIVE ALL THEIR ATTENTION IS ON TRY TO 
RE BUILD THEIR HOMES AND THEIR 
LIVES LIVES THE B. B. C. IS NOT ALLOWED INTO BURMA 
DANIEL GRIFFITHS OUR CORRESPONDENT 
IS IN NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY 
THAILAND AND JOINS US FROM BANGKOK 
DANIEL GOOD MORNING PRESUMABLY 
THIS DEATH TOLL SHOCKING AS IT IS 
IS EXPECTED TO RISE 
THAT IS 
CERTAINLY WHAT THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN SAYING YES 
BECAUSE MANY OF THE AREAS THAT HAVE 
BEEN HIT ARE VERY REMOTE AND 
INACCESSIBLE AND AUTHORITIES AND 
RESCUE WORKERS SIMPLY HAVE NOT BEEN 
ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO SOME OF THEM 
SO HE WAS SAYING EXPECT THE 
CASUALTY LIST TO RISE IN THE HOURS 
AND DAYS AHEAD 
BURMA IS A PRETTY 
ISOLATED NATION RUN BY A MILITARY 
JUNTA FOR DECADES JUST HOW MUCH 
ARE THEY OPENING UP TO LET AID IN 
THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION WE'VE 
JUST BEEN SPEAKING TO THE BRITISH 
AMBASSADOR IN BURMA AND HE'S SAYING 
THAT PEOPLE THERE ARE SHELL SHOCKED 
AND THE FACT THAT BURMA HAS 
ACTUALLY SAID IT WANTS 
INTERNATIONAL AID IS A SIGN OF THE 
SCALE OF THE PROBLEM THERE BUT AS 
YOU SAY THE REAL TEST WILL BE HOW 
MUCH IS BURMA WILLING TO OPEN UP 
AND NOT JUST THAT HOW EASY WILL IT 
BE FOR MANY AID AGENCIES TO GET TO 
THESE REMOMENT AREAS ONE AGENCY 
SAYS THEY'LL NEED BOATS AND PLANES 
TO GET TO SOME OF THE AREAS THEY 
SAID INITIALLY THEY THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE A TWO MONTH OPERATION BUT 
NOW THEY'RE THINKING IT COULD BE A 
TWO YEAR OPERATION SO THAT IS A 
SIGN OF THE CHALLENGE FACING BOTH 
THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES AND 
INTERNATIONAL AID AGENCIES THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR'S TIME WE'RE 
GOING TO SPEAK TO THE BRITISH RED 
CROSS ABOUT RELIEF EFFORTS IN BURMA 
OTHER NEWS HERE THE HUGE 
INVESTMENT IN SECURITY CAMERAS HAS 
NOT CUT CRIME RATES THAT'S 
ACCORDING TO THE HEAD OF C. C. T. V. AT 
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE D. C. I. MICK

CRIMINALS AND ONLY THREE PER CENT OF STREET 
ROBBERIES HAS BEEN SOLVED USING THE 
FOOTAGE WE ARE THE MOST WATCHED 
NATION WITH CAMERAS WATCHING OUR 
EVERY MOVE THEIR MAIN JOB IS TO 
HELP DETECT CRIME BUT HOW 
EFFECTIVE ARE THEY ACCORDING TO MR. 
NEVILLE HE SAYS NOT EFFECTIVE 
ENOUGH HE SAYS ONLY A TINY PER CENT OF 
CRIMES HAVE BEEN SOLVED USING C. C. T. V. 
SCOTLAND YARD HAS STARTED BUILDING 
A DATABASE WITH IMAGES FROM CAMERAS 
OF CRIMINALS AND UNIDENTIFIED 
SUSPECTS AND FROM NEXT MONTH IT 
WILL PUBLISH PHOTOS OF SUSPECTS IN 
MUGGING RAPE AND ROBBERY CASES ON 
THE INTERNET THE IDEA BEING THAT 
CRIMINALS WILL SEE THAT C. C. T. V. WORKS 
MAKING THEM LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT 
CRIMES THERE INCREASE OF 
SECURITY CAMERAS AND THERE ARE 
CALLS FOR ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS TO BE 
PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY 
IMAGES STORED ON A DATABASE ARE 
USED ONLY FOR DETECTING CRIME 
FROM TODAY EMPLOYERS WILL HAVE TO 
PROVE THAT THEY CAN'T FILL A POST

THAT AFTER HIS SIDE LOST AND 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN TALKING ABOUT HIS

CHELSEA FANS PLATINI HELPS TIE UP 
VISA DEAL FOR FINAL IT MEANS THEY 
HAVE A SEVEN HOUR GRACE PERIOD TO GET 
IN FOR SEVEN HOURS IF YOU HAVE YOUR 
PASSPORT ALL READY BUT IF YOU MISS 
THAT SEVENTY TWO HOURS YOU HAVE TO GET A 
VISA AND PAY FOR IT 
NOW LOOK AT THE FRONT OF THE 
PAGES AND MANY HAVE BEEN LEADING 
WITH WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN 
BURMA WITH TEN THOUSAND DEAD IN THE 
CYCLONE WE ALREADY KNOW THOSE 
FIGURES HAVE RISEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND BUT 
IT IS LIKELY TO GET LOT HIGHER 
BECAUSE SO MANY PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY ARE INACCESSIBLE 
AND THE GUARDIAN AND THE 
INDEPENDENT SPEAKS OF BURMA'S WIND 
OF CHANGE A COUPLE OF PAPERS 
CONCENTRATE ON THE JOSEF FRITZL 
STORY AND THEY HAVE PICTURE OF 
ALEXANDER FRITZL PROUDLY GRASPING 
CANDLE AT HIS FIRST COMMUNION AND 
LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER HAPPY 
YOUNGSTER BUT HE WAS IN A CELLAR 
HE WAS THE ONE OF TWINS AND HIS 
TWIN BROTHER DIED 
AND THIS EVEN WORSE ALLEGATION IN 
THE SUN THAT JOSEF FRITZL MAY HAVE 
RAPED HIS OWN GRANDCHILD 
THE DAILY MAIL REPORTS THAT M. P.'S ARE 
GOING TO BEGIN FIGHT TO CUT THE 
NUMBER OF ABORTIONS BY LIMITING A 
WOMAN'S RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION 
FOR SOCIAL REASONS AND CLAIMS THAT 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LIVES COULD BE SAVED THEY 
WANT THE UPPER LIMIT REDUCED TO TWENTY 
WEEKS AND INSIDE TWO SWEET ANIMAL 
STORIES 
YES WE HAVE TO AISE THE STORIES MOOD A HAD BIT 
THIS IS A SWEET 
LITTLE DEER THAT WAS ORPHANED AND 
HAS TAKEN UP WITH A GREAT DANE 
TOWELLY HE'S A DAD BUT THEY HAVE 
TAKEN TO EACH OTHER AT AN ANIMAL 
RESCUE CENTRE 
THIS IS ANOTHER AAH BUT IT IS A 
BIT OOH THIS IS ABOUT A GOLD FISH 
THAT CAN DO ALL SORTS OF TRICKS IT 
HAS LEARNT TO PLAY FOOTBALL 
BASKETBALL AND LIMBO UNDER A 
MINIATURE BAR IN ITS TANK IT IS 
THE RESULT OF INTENSIVE TRAINING 
BY ITS OWNER AND THE FISH CAN 
SWIM THROUGH A NARROW TUBE AND PUSH 
A BALL OVER A SET OF POSTS 
HERE IS DECLAN WITH HIS PAPERS 
THAT'S GOT TO BE A HOAX GOLDFISH 
HAVE THE MEMORY OF SIX OR SEVEN 
SECONDS HOW DO THEY REMEMBER WHAT 
TO DO WITH THE BALL THE NEXT TIME 
THEY GET IT THEY HAVE THE MEMORY 
OF BUSINESS PRESENTERS AT TIMES 
MORE BAD NEWS ABOUT THE HOUSING 
MARKET THIS IS THE INDEPENDENT 
LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF 
REPOSSESSIONS UNUSUALLY FROM SOME 
OF THE REPORTS THIS ISN'T 
PREDICTION THIS IS THE NUMBER OF 
REPOSSESSION ORDERS SINCE DURING 
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN NINE FIVE THREE SEVEN FOUR NINE FIVE THREE SEVEN FOUR THE FINANCIAL TIMES THERE IS A 
STORY ABOUT B. A. E. SYSTEMS IT 
PUBLISHES A REPORT WITHIN THE NEXT 
HOUR A REPORT LOOKING AT ITS OWN 
ETHICAL STANDARDS IT FOLLOWS THE 
REPORTS ABOUT WHETHER PAYMENTS WERE 
MADE TO SECURE CONTRACTS IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST NOW THE REPORT DOESN'T 
LOOK AT THE PAYMENTS AT THE 
ALLEGED PAYMENTS BUT IT LOOKS AT 
HOW THE COMPANY RUNS ITS BUSINESS 
TODAY TODAY THAT'S OUT AT SEVEN HUNDRED A M. EXPECT WE 
WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT AFTER 
THEN THEN SOME NEWS FROM THE BANKS IT IS 
ANOTHER BIG LOSS AT ONE OF EUROPE'S 
BIGGEST BANKS IT IS AT THE SWISS 
BANK U. B. S. IT LOST ONE POINT SIX BILLION IN 
THE FIVE POINT SIX BILLION IN THE LAST 
THREE MONTHS OF TRADING IT HASN'T 
CUT THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS 
FURTHER BUT IT HAD ALREADY CUT THE 
VALUE OF INVESTMENTS IN THINGS LIKE 
AMERICAN MORTGAGE DEBT BY TWENTY 
BILLION ANOTHER BIG LOSS AT U. B. S. 
THOUSANDS OF JOBS MANUFACTURING 
JOBS ARE AT RISK THE C. B. I. SAYS IT 
HAS SPOKEN TO FIVE HUNDRED MANUFACTURING 
FIRMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEY THEY 
EXPECT TO LOSE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED JOBS BY THE 
SUMMER SUMMER A WARNING THAT THE HIGH OIL PRICE 
COULD SNUFF OUT ANY RECOVERY IN THE 
WIDER ECONOMY THAT'S ACCORDING TO 
ERNST AND AMP YOUNG IT SAYS ITS GROWTH 
FORECAST OF FIFTEEN PER CENT NEXT YEAR WOULD 
HAVE TO BE SCALED BACK TO ONE PER CENT IF OIL 
CONTINUES TO CLIMB UP WARDS 
CLIMB UPWARDS 
IT SEEMS SOME OF US WOULD CONSIDER 
REDUCING THE OFFER WE MAKE ON 
HOUSE IF PRICES FELL AFTERWARDS NINE 
OUT OF TEN SAID THEY WOULD CONSIDER 
WHAT IS KNOWN AS DISGUNDERING EVEN 
MOST OF US THINK IT IS UNETHICAL 
THAT'S WHEN YOU GET TO THE LAST 
STAGE OF THE HOUSE SALE AND THE 
BUYER LOWERS THE PRICE YOU ARE 
OFFERING IS THAT RIGHT 
NO IT IS 
WHERE YOU MAKE AN OFFER FOR A HOUSE 
AND YOU AGREE A PRICE AND YOU COME 
BACK AFTERWARDS AND SAY ACTUALLY 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT 
WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU LESS AH AH I UNDERSTAND 
AT LEAST FIFTEEN THOUSAND ARE DEAD AND MANY 
MORE ARE HOMELESS IN THE PSYCHE 
CONE IN BURMA 
CYCLONE IN BURMA 
FEAR THAT IS PLASTIC IN BABIES 
BOTTLES COULD POSE A HEALTH RISK 
TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE RIVER AND THE 
BOATS IS KA STROFIC 
CATASTROPHIC 
THE CANAL WORKERS FACING THE LOSS 
OF THEIR JOBS AND THE HOMES THAT 
COME WITH THEM 
WHAT'S THE WEATHER GOING TO BE 
LIKE LIKE WELL THE WEATHER THIS WEEK IS 
LOOKING PROMISING FOR MANY PARTS OF 
THE BRITISH ISLES TODAY IT IS 
GOING TO BE WARM AND SUNNY WITH 
TEMPERATURES INTO THE LOW TWENTIES MORE 
OF A BREEZE IN SOUTHERN AREAS SO 
NOT FEELING AS WARM AS IT DID 
YESTERDAY BUT GOOD FOR THE TIME OF 
YEAR YEAR ON THE SATELLITE PICTURE YOU CAN 
SEE A BIG LUMP OF CLOUD THIS IS 
WHAT PRODUCED THE RAIN YESTERDAY AS 
IT CAREERED OVER TOWARDS THE WEST 
AND THERE IS A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD IN 
WESTERN AREAS THIS MORNING THE 
OTHER THING WE HAVE ACROSS SCOTLAND 
IS THAT SOME LOW CLOUD AND FOG 
CLOSE TO THE NORTH EAST BUT 
THROUGH THE DAY MOST OF THAT WILL 
LIFT APART FROM IN THE NORTHERN 
ISLES ISLES BITS AND PIECES OF CLOUD ACROSS THE 
NORTH OF ENGLAND AND THEN WE GET 
INTO THE BLUE SKIES CLOSE TO THE 
COAST THE BREEZE WILL MAKE IT FEEL 
COOLERMENT YOU DON HAVE TO MOVE TOO 
FAR INLAND FOR THE TEMPERATURE TO 
GO UP FOR THE SOUTH WEST THIS IS 
THE PICTURE AT NINE A M. WE ARE LOOKING 
AT SUNSHINE AS WE ARE ACROSS WALES 
AGAIN THERE WILL BE CLOUD AROUND 
REMNANTS OF YESTERDAY'S FRONT WHICH 
PRODUCED THE RAIN AND THE SAME TOO 
ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
IF YOU ARE YOU ARE UNLUCKY TODAY 
YOU COULD SEE THE ODD SHOWER IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND WESTERN 
SCOTLAND BUT YOU WILL BE UNLUCKY 
TO SEE THAT FOR MOST OF US IT 
WILL BE A FINE DAYMENT WE WILL HANG 
ON TO THE CLOUD FOR LONGER WITH 
TEMPERATURES UP TO TWENTY ONE CELSIUS 
A LOT OF DRY WEATHER ON OFFER 
AGAIN WE WILL HAVE LOW CLOUD ACROSS 
THE NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND MAYBE 
PATCHY MIST AND FOG PARTICULARLY 
OVER THE VALE OF YORK BUT DRY AND 
FOURTEEN CELSIUS THE OVERNIGHT LOW IN 
LONDON LONDON SO NOT A COLD START TO THE DAY AND 
TOMORROW TOMORROW THERE WILL BE A 
FAIR BIT OF SUNSHINE AROUND WITH 
CLOUD OUT TOWARDS THE WEST MAYBE 
PRODUCING THE THE ODD SHOWER 
TEMPERATURES UP ON TODAY WE ARE 
LOOKING AT A MAXIMUM OF TWENTY THREE CELSIUS 
ON THURSDAY THE TEMPERATURE IS SET 
TO GET UP HIGHER 
THAT'S IT 
A CHEMICAL FOUND IN SOME PLASTIC 
BABY BOTTLES COULD AFFECT 
CHILDREN'S HEALTH PROMPTING MORE 
CALLS FOR MORE INFORMATION FOR 
PARENTS PARENTS THE SUBSTANCE COULD CAUSE 
BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES IN INFANTS AND 
TRIGGER THE EARLY ONSET OF PUBERTY 
IN GIRLS 
BRITISH HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY THERE 
IS NO EVIDENCE THAT BOTTLES ARE 
UNSAFE UNSAFE IT IS THE LAST THING A PARENT WANTS 
TO 
TO WORRY ABOUTMENT A U. S. GOVERNMENT 
REPORT LAST MONTH RAISED CONCERNS 
ABOUT A SUBSTANCE FOUND IN BABIES 
BOTTLES CALLED B. P. A. CANADA SAID IT 
WANTS TO BAN IT IN THE U. S. MAJOR 
CHAIN STORES INCLUDING WALL MART 
SAY THEY WILL STOP SELLING THEM AND 
HERE ASDA ARE INTRODUCING THEIR OWN 
B. P. A. FREE RANGE 
WE ARE GETTING CUSTOMER FEEDBACK 
THEY ARE SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING 
IN CANADA AND AMERICA WE ARE 
GETTING CUSTOMER FEEDBACK WITH 
REGARDS TO B. P. A. WE ARE PROVIDING 
CUSTOMERS WITH A CHOICE BY 
PROVIDING THE RANGE 
WHAT IS IT IT IS A CHEMICAL THAT'S 
FOUND IN REUSABLE PLASTIC PRODUCTS 
TESTS IN ANIMALS FOUND IT CAN 
AFFECT THE NEUROLOGICAL AND IMMUNE 
SYSTEMS BUT THERE IS NO TO SHOW IT 
IS A RISK TO HUMANS 
THE AMOUNT OF THE CHEMICAL IN 
PRODUCTS LIKE THIS ARE WELL BELOW 
LEVELS CONSIDERED HARMFUL A REPORT 
IN APRIL BY THE U. S. NATIONAL 
TOXICOLOGY PROGRAMME CAUSED SOME TO 
QUESTION THE ADVICE BASED ON 
ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS IT STATES 
EXPOSURE TO LOW LEVELS OF B. P. A. CAN 
CAUSE CHANGES IN BEHAVIOUR AND THE 
BRAIN AND THE AGE AT WHICH FEMALES 
ATTAIN PUBERTY IT CONCLUDES IT MAY 
ALTER HUMAN DEVELOPMENT CANNOT BE 
DISMISSED THOSE CONCERNS ARE 
SHARED BY TOXICOLOGISTS HERE 
MAYBE THERE IS A CASE TO RECONSIDER 
WHAT PEOPLE DO NOW AND SWITCH TO 
GLASS OR SWITCH TO PLASTIC 
ALTERNATIVES WHICH DO NOT LEECH OUT 
B. P. A. B. P. A. WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS A VERY CALM 
RATIONAL APPROACH TO THIS IN 
COLLABORATION WITH INDUSTRY AND 
WITH EVERYBODY TO BE ON THE SAFE 
SIDE AND THAT'S THE ATTITUDE OF THE 
AUTHORITIES IN CANADA AND ALSO IN 
THE U. S. 
THESE YOUNG MOTHERS HAD LIMITED 
KNOWLEDGE OF B. P. A. SOME KNEW NOTHING 
AT ALL 
I I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOTTLES WITH 
THOSE CHEMICALS AND WITHOUT 
THERE IS SOMETHING IN IT AS CANADA 
BANNED IT I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE 
ANY CHANCES 
U. S. AUTHORITIES SET UP A TASKFORCE 
TO GIVE PARENTS INFORMATION THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR 
NOT SUPPLYING ENOUGH 
ON BEHALF OF PARENTS WE ARE 
CONCERNED THAT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT 
B. P. A. MIGHT LEACH OUT OF PLASTIC 
BOTTLES BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING ELSE 
WE NEED CLEAR LABELLING PARENTS 
NEED TO KNOW OF THE RISK AND KNOW 
HOW TO AVOID IT 
THE NATIONAL CHILDBIRTH TRUST 
ADVISES NOT TO POUR BOILING WATER 
INTO A BOTTLE AS THIS CAN CAUSE 
MORE OF THE CHEMICAL TO BE RELEASED 
THEY SAY SCRATCHED AND DAMAGED 
BOTTLES SHOULD BE DISCARDED 
IT SAYS IT IS FOLLOWING ALL 
RESEARCH CLOSELY AND WILL RE NEW 
ADVICE IF THERE ARE NEW FINDINGS 
THERE WILL BE SO MANY PARENTS 
CONCERNED AND CONFUSED WE HAVE THE 
FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY SAYING THE 
BOTTLES ARE SAFE BUT IN THE STATES 
THEY ARE TAKING THEM OFF THE 
SHELVES SHELVES INDEED IT IS A CONTROVERSIAL 
SUBJECT AND AS YOU SAY THE 
OFFICIAL ADVICE THEY ARE SAFE ALL 
THE TESTS HAVE BEEN DONE SAYING 
THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH THE 
BOTTLES BUT THE TESTS THAT THE 
CANADIAN AND THE AMERICAN 
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT 
THEY WERE DONE ON ANIMALS AND THEY 
SAY REALLY THAT ANY POTENTIAL RISK 
CANNOT BE DISMISSED AND THEY ARE 
TAKING THE BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY 
ATTITUDE THE KA NAINIAN CANADIAN 
GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO BAN THESE 
AND IN THE STATES WE SEE SOME OF 
THE MAJOR RETAILERS THEY ARE 
TAKING THEM OUT OF THEIR SHOPS 
GIVING PEOPLE AN ALTERNATIVE AND 
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE STARTING TO SEE 
HERE PT A LOT OF THE RERETAILER WE 
HAVE SEEN ASDA BRINGING IN 
FREE RANGE 
THE MANUFACTURERS ARE SAYING THEY 
ARE OFFERING MORE ALTERNATIVE LE 
NATIONAL CHILDCARE TRUST WANT 
PEOPLE TO BE GIVEN PROPER LABELLING 
AND TO GIVE PARENTS UP A CHOICE 
WHEN MIXING UP FORMULA YOU YOU 
OFTEN PUT THE HOT WATER IN AND PUT 
THE FORMULA IN WHAT ARE ARE 
PARENTS TO DO 
DO NOT POUR BOILING 
WATER DIRECTLY INTO THE PLASTIC 
BOTTLES THAT CAN RELEASE MORE OF 
THE CHEMICALS AND THAT'S ONE THING 
THEY SHOULDN'T DO THERE ARE 
ALTERNATIVES THERE ARE BOTTLES 
THAT HAVE NON B. P. A. AND PARENTS CAN 
USE GLASS BOTTLES 
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOURS HAS 
B. P. A. IN IT OR NOT THESE ARE SQUEEZY 
YOU CAN SQUEEZE THEM LIKE THAT 
IT HASN'T GOT B. P. A. 
IT IS THE RIGID HARD BOTTLES 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

COSTUMES HAVE INFLUENCED FASHION 
BUT THAT DIDN'T LOOK VERY COMFY I I DON'T KNOW YOU COULD WEAR A 
SPIDER'S WEB OVER YOUR FACE IT 
COULD BE EXCITING AND ENTICING 
THE INVESTMENT BANK U. B. S. GIVES ITS 
FIRST RECORDS FOR THE YEAR A 
QUESTION FOR CHRIS HOLLINS IF HE 
WAS A SUPERHERO WHAT WOULD HE BE 
MIGHTY MOUSE BUT WE HAVE A 
SUPERHERO IN SNOOCKER THE ROCKET 
MAN RONNIE IP SNOOKER 
HE IS NOW THREE TIMES WORLD 
CHAMPION BUT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
ONCE AGAIN HINTED AT RETIREMENT 
HE SAW OFF THE CHALLENGER ALI 
CARTER EIGHTEEN TO EIGHT TO CLINCH THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP AND THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PRIZE 
MONEY IT CAPS A SUPERB SEASON FOR 
THE TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD WHO ALSO WON THE U. K. 
CHAMPIONSHIP AND WENT BACK TO THE 
TOP OF THE WORLD RANKINGS BUT 
LFRDZ O'SULLIVAN SAID HE WOULD 
CONTEMPLATE OVER THE SUMMER WHETHER 
HE WOULD CONTINUE WITH THE SPORT 
IT'S QUITE WELL DOCUMENTED THAT I 
STRUGGLE WITH MY GAME AND THE SPORT 
AND IN SOME WAYS IT WOULD BE NICE 
TO GO OUT AS WORLD CHAMPION BUT 
I'LL THINK OVER THE SUMMER BECAUSE 
IT COULD BE A GOOD TIME TO HAVE A 
LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK 
THE RACE FOR 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE WILL GO 
DOWN TO THE VERY LAST GAME CHELSEA 
BEAT NEWCASTLE UNITED TWO TO ZERO 
MICHAEL BALLACK SCORED THE OPENING 
GOAL AND MALOUDA SCORED THE SECOND 
UNITED HAVE A SUPERIOR GOAL 
DIFFERENCE OF SEVENTEEN GOALS SO IF 
UNITED WIN AGAINST WIGAN ON SUNDAY 
THEY WILL RETAIN THEIR TITLE ONE I SAID THAT WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP 
WE'LL GIVE THEM A GOOD GOOD BATTLE 
I KNOW NOBODY THOUGHT OF US AS A 
CANDIDATE FOR CHAMPIONS AND NOW 
WE'RE THE SAME POINTS ONLY GOAL 
DIFFERENCE AND WE'LL KEEP ON 
FIGHTING MAYBE AT THE END OF THE 
YEAR WE'LL SEE WHAT I SAID IN THE 
FIRST GAME THAT HE LOST BECAUSE OF 
THE MISTAKES OF THE REFEREE 
THERE IS GOOD NEWS FOR CHELSEA AND 
MANCHESTER UNITED FANS HEADING FOR 
MOSCOW FOR THE FINAL TRAVELLING 
FANS WILL NOW NEED TO PRESENT A 
VALID MATCH TICKET ALONG WITH THEIR 
PASSPORT BETWEEN THE PERIOD OF NINETEEN 
T. H. 
AND TWO RD MAY AND THEY WILL 
NOT NEED TO GET VISA TWENTY THIRD MAY 
AND FLAMY'S CONTRACT WITH THE 
EMIRATES WAS DUE TO END THIS SUMMER 
AND HE'S TURNED DOWN THE CHANCE TO 
STAY IN NORTH LONDON 
S. FALKIRK BEAT HEARTS IN THEIR FIRST DEFEAT 
ARSENAL LADIES WON IN THE F. A. CUP 
FINAL AND MAINTAIN ARSENAL'S RECORD 
OF NEVER LOSING AN F. A. CUP FINAL IN 
NINE ATTEMPTS AND MARKS THE TWENTY FIFTH 
TROPHY WON BY THE CLUB IN SIXTEEN YEARS 
ANDY MURRAY FOUGHT OFF SCARE IN 
NINE H. THE OFF SCARE IN THE ROME 
MASTERS WHEN HIS OPPONENT RETIRED 
WITH A BACK INJURY 
AND SOME OF THE HEADLINES ON THE 
BACK PAGES THE TIMES HAS THE 
HEADLINE TWIST FOR CHELSEA BUT 
WHAT DOES KEVIN KEEGAN SAY ABOUT 
IT IT'S BORING BECAUSE IT WILL 
TAKE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS 
FOR ALL THE OTHER CLUBS TO CATCH UP 
AND DOWN HERE IN FORMULA ONE THE 
SUPER AGURI TEAM WERE LOCKED OUT OF 
FORMULA ONE BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL 
PROBLEMS AND THAT INCLUDES A 
BRITISH DRIVER AND THE CURTIS CUP 
TEAM ARE GETTING READY FOR THEIR 
MATCH AT SAINT ANDREWS AGAINST AMERICA 
ON MAY THIRTIETH BUT THEY HAVE BEEN 
BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED WHY BECAUSE 
THEY WERE PROMISED THAT IAN POULTER 
WOULD DESIGN THEIR CLOTHES BUT 
APPARENTLY THEY'VE OPTED OUT OF 
THAT AND THEY ARE GOING MORE 
CONSERVATIVE DOESN'T KEVIN KEEGAN 
HAVE POINT 
WELL WE'LL TALK 
ABOUT THAT LATER ON AND I THINK IT 
COULD BE A GREAT IDEA TO MAKE IT 
MORE INTERESTING BUT IT WILL NEVER 
HAPPEN WICKHAM WILL NEVER GET ANY 
PLAYERS 
MORE OVER WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING 
IN BURMA MORE DEVASTATING NEWS 
FROM THERE THIS MORNING IT IS 
REPORTED THAT AT LEAST FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THE CYCLONE 
THAT HIT ON THURSDAY WE'RE ASKING 
WHAT KIND OF HELP IS GETTING 
THROUGH THERE MOIRA COULD TELL US 
SHE WORKS FOR THE RED CROSS IT IS 
ALWAYS A BIG CHALLENGE AFTER 
DISASTER LIKE THIS BUT 
PARTICULARLY IN A PLACE LIKE BURMA 
YES BURMA IS NOT A PLACE THAT HAS 
ACCEPTED LARGE SCALE INTERNATIONAL 
ASSISTANCE BEFORE THERE ARE A 
NUMBER OF LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS THERE 
AS YOU WOULD EXPECT COMMUNICATIONS 
ARE VERY DIFFICULT AND THE AIRPORT 
IS CLOSED AS YOU WOULD EXPECT BUT 
THERE WERE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND RED CROSS 
VOLUNTEERS OUT EVACUATING 
COMMUNITIES AND THEY'RE PROVIDING 
FIRST AID AND DISTRIBUTING FAMILY 
KITS AND OTHER KITS FOR SHELTER 
AND IT IS WILL BE A CASE OF WHEN 
WE CAN GET MORE DATA HOW TO GET 
MORE SUPPLIES INTO THE AFFECTED 
AREAS 
AND BECAUSE COMMUNICATION IS AREAS SO DIFFICULT IT IS HARD TO GET 
THAT SORT OF INFORMATION HOW BROAD 
IS THE DISASTER AREA 
FIVE REGIONS 
HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND THE CAPITAL 
CITY AS WELL IT IS HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DISPLACED AND 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN 
NEED OF HELP WHAT WE DON'T HAVE 
YET ARE THE ABSOLUTE NUMBERS OF 
DEATHS AND THE ABSOLUTE NUMBERS OF 
HOMELESS AND AFFECTED AND WE HAVE 
NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET TO EVERY AREA 
YET TO KNOW WHERE TO PRIORITISE THE 
HELP 
AND LOTS OF WATER BUT IT IS HELP NOT DRINKABLE SO THAT WOULD BE A 
PRIORITY AND THEN SHELTER AND FOOD 
YES THE PRIORITIES ARE CLEAN WATER 
AND SHELTER INCLUDING CLOTHING FOR 
THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CLOTHING 
WHAT RESPONSE ARE YOU GETTING FROM 
THE MILITARY JUNTA WHICH CLOSED 
ITSELF OFF FROM THE WORLD DIDN'T 
IT 
WELL THE RED CROSS IS IN A IT DIFFERENT POSITION FROM OTHER 
AGENCIES THERE ARE RELATIONSHIPS 
WITH ALL THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
ALREADY THERE IN PLACE 
AND SO YOU 
HAVE A BIT OF A HEAD START YES YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
LOCK KEEPERS WHO FOR YEARS HAVE 
LIVED NEXT TO THE RIVER THAMES 
COULD LOSE THEIR HOMES UNDER COST 
CUTTING PLANS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT 
AGENCY THE HOUSES ARE USUALLY 
PROVIDED ALONG WITH THE JOB AND AN 
AVERAGE SALARY OF SIXTEEN THOUSAND YEAR 
ONE FAMILY CAME BACK FROM HOLIDAY 
TO BE TOLD THEY WOULD HAVE TO LOSE 
THEIR HOME 
THIS IS OUR HOME IT IS 
PART OF MY HUSBAND'S CONTRACT THAT 
WE LIVE IN THIS HOUSE AT THE 
MOMENT THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY IS 
LOOKING AT ALL THE HOUSES ALONG THE 
THAMES TO SEE WHICH ONES THEY NEED 
AND HAVE COME UP WITH A SHORT LIST 
OF TWO PROPERTIES THEY WANT TO 
DISPOSE OF OF WHICH OURS IS ONE OF 
THEM SOME THEY'RE GOING TO SELL 
OUTRIGHT AND THE OTHERS THEY'RE 
GOING TO LET POSSIBLY FOR HOLIDAY 
LETS THIS IS NOW REDUCED TO A 
FIVE YEAR PLAN AND THERE ARE 
FEELINGS THERE WILL BE REDUNDANCIES 
DESPITE WHAT THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY 
SAYS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY 
CAN MOVE TWENTY TWO FAMILIES WITHOUT MAKING 
THE REDUNDANCIES WHERE ARE THEY 
GOING TO PUT THEM THIS IS OUR 
LIFESTYLE AND THE WAY WE LIVE IT 
IS A JOB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS AND MY HUSBAND HAS 
BEEN A LOCK KEEPER FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS AND 
TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE RIVER AND THE 
BOATS IT'S CATASTROPHIC AND IT IS 
VERY HARD ON US WAITING TO HEAR 
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN 
STEVE IS 
FROM UNISON THE UNION REPRESENTING 
LOCK KEEPERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOR COMING INTO US THIS MORNING 
WE'RE LOOKING AT TEN OF THE FIVE 
PROPERTIES ALONG THE RIVER THAT 
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOLD 
YES FIRST OF ALL I THINK TEN IS A 
PROVISIONAL FIGURE BUT WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE A 
VOCATION FOR THIS JOB IT IS A WAY 
OF LIFE FOR THEM IT IS NOT JUST 
JOB AND THIS IS A JOB WHICH IS 
QUITE RARE THESE DAYS WHERE THE 
JOB GOES WITH THE HOUSE SO THE 
HOUSE IS THE FAMILY HOUSE CHILDREN 
PARTNERS THEY'RE ALL LIVING THERE 
AND THE IDEA OF TELLING SOMEONE 
THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER GOING TO 
LIVE THERE AND THEY MAY HAVE TO 
LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE IS REALLY 
UNACCEPTABLE I THINK 
SO ALTHOUGH 
THEY WILL BE OFFERED ALTERNATIVE 
ACCOMMODATION THEY ARE ON SIXTEEN THOUSAND 
A YEAR PRESUMABLY THE REASON THEY 
ARE PAID SO LITTLE AT THE MOMENT IS 
BECAUSE THE HOUSE ONE THROWN IN AS 
IT WERE YES 
WHEN THAT HOUSE IS YES TAKEN AWAY WILL THEIR WAGES GO UP 
HOW IS IT GOING TO WORK WE'RE WE'RE TALKING TO THE AGENCY WHERE THEIR 
EARNINGS WILL GO UP IN LIEU OF 
PAYING RENT 
SO THEY WILL STILL BE 
WORKING ON THE RIVER BUT THEY 
WON'T HAVE A HOUSE 
WELL THEY WILL 
HAVE A HOUSE THE POINT IS WE 
DON'T WANT ANYONE TO BE FORCED TO 
MOVE AGAINST THEIR WISH IF 
SOMEBODY IS OFFERED AN ALTERNATIVE 
HOUSE WHERE THEY ARE HAPPY TO LIVE 
THAT'S FINE BUT IF THEY ARE 
OFFERED AN UNREASONABLE MOVE WE 
THINK IT IS UNREASONABLE OF THE 
AGENCY TO FORCE SOMEBODY TO MOVE TO 
A DIFFERENT LOCATION SO WE ARE 
LOOKING FOR THIS TO BE DONE BY 
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE MAIN STORIES THIS MORNING AT 
LEAST FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE DEAD AND 
MANY MORE HOMELESS IN THE 
DEVASTATING CYCLONE IN BURMA 
RESEARCHERS IN AMERICA SAY A 
CHEMICAL FOUND IN SOME PLASTIC BABY 
BOTTLES COULD AFFECT CHILDREN'S 
HEALTH PROMPTING MORE CALLS FOR 
INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN TO PARENTS 
HERE ALSO COMING UP A NUMBER ONE 
SINGLE AND AN AWARD WINNING FILM 
CAREER AND NOW ON THE STAGE AND 
HE'S ONLY TWENTY FIVE ASH LEEWALTERS WILL 
BE HERE ON THE SOFA 
HE WON'T BE WEARING THE OLD I I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WILL BE WEARING 
WEARING WEARING WHAT ARE THEY CALLED 
BEANY CAPS WEARING 
WHAT ARE THEY CALLED BEANY CAPS I'M JUST OVER TWENTY FIVE BY ONE YEAR 
IT IS NOT A COLD START ACROSS MANY 
PARTS HAVING SAID THAT THERE IS A 
BREEZE IN SOME PARTS AND THAT'S 
TAKING THE EDGE OF THE TEMPERATURE 
TEMPERATURES STILL HEALTHY FOR THE 
TIME OF THE YEAR IN THE BULK OF THE 
BRITISH ISLES ENJOYING YET ANOTHER 
WARM AND SUNNY DAY YOU CAN SEE ON 
THE SATELLITE PICTURE THE BIG LUMP 
OF CLOUD THAT WE HAD YESTERDAY 
THAT'S WHAT PRODUCED THE RAIN IT 
IS A A A WEAK FRONT BUT WE COULD 
CATCH THE ODD SHOWER IN SCOTLAND 
AND NORTHERN IRELAND TODAY THE 
OTHER THING WE HAVE GOT IS A BIT OF 
LOW CLOUD AND PATCHY FOG A LITTLE 
BIT OF THAT AFETTING THE NORTH EAST 
AFFECTING THE NORTH EAST BUT FOR 
THE BULK OF ENGLAND WE ARE LOOKING 
AT A GORGEOUS DAY 
MOVE INLAND AND WE ARE BACK INTO 
THE HIGHER TEMPERATURES FOR THE 
SOUTH WEST A BEAUTIFUL START TO 
THE DAY BITS AND PIECES OF CLOUD 
AROUND AS INDEED THERE WILL BE 
ACROSS WALES THIS MORNING BUT 
THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE 
TOO TOO AFTER CLOUDY MISTY START TO THE 
DAY ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND IT 
WILL BRIGHTEN UP BUT THERE IS 
SMALL RISK OF SHOWER HEREMENT 
HEREMENT 
THROUGH THE DAY LOT OF THE CLOUD 
DOES BREAK UP THE LOW CLOUD ACROSS 
THE NORTH EAST TENNING TO BREAK UP 
AS WELL 
FOR MANY IT IS PLEASANT WARM 
SUNSHINE EIGHTEEN CELSIUS IN NEWCASTLE 
COMPARED TO TWENTY TWO CELSIUS IN GLASGOW 
AS WE HEAD THROUGH THIS EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT AGAIN A LOT OF CLEAR 
SKIES ON OFFER THE LOW CLOUD CLOUD 
WILL REFORM AGAIN THERE WILL BE 
MIST AND PATCHY FOG FOG ALSO ACROSS 
THE VALE OF YORK BUT FOR MOST IT 
WON'T BE A COLD NIGHT 
NOT A COLD START TOMORROW WHEN WE 
LOSE THE AND THE MIST AND THE FOG 
AND THE LOW CLOUD ANOTHER FINE DAY 
IN PROSPECT IN THE WEST THERE 
WILL BE MORE CLOUD AT TIMES THAT 
COULD PRODUCE THE ODD SHARP SHOWER 
BUT TEMPERATURES ABOUT TWENTY THREE CELSIUS 
ON THURSDAY FOR MOST OF US AGAIN 
IT WILL BE GLORIOUS DAY 
TEMPERATURES UP A TOUCH ON 
WEDNESDAY BUT THERE WILL BE 
BREAKDOWN COMING INTO THE SOUTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND IN THE FORM OF RAIN 
THAT'S IT 
THURSDAY LOOKS REALLY NICE LET'S 
GO BACK TO DECLAN 
GOOD MORNING EVERYONE SOME NEWS 
FROM THE BANKS TODAY LLOYD'S WILL 
TELL US IN THE NEXT FIFTEEN MINUTES IF 
IT IS LIKELY TO APPROACH ITS 
SHAREHOLDERS FOR SOME MORE MONEY 
WE HAVE HAD NEWS IN FROM THE SWISS 
BANK U. B. S. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT 
BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
BANKS IN EUROPE AND IT UNVEILED 
ANOTHER BIG LOSS RALPH SILVA IS 
WITH ME 
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE SWISS IN A 
SECOND FIRST OF ALL LLOYD'S T. S. B. 
IT IS AN UP TO DATE AND THEY ARE 
NOT AS EXPOSE TODAY AMERICAN 
MORTGAGE DEBT AS SOME OF THEIR 
RIVALS THEY HAVE BEEN MORE 
CAUTIOUS ABOUT THINGS 
THEY HAVE 
AND MORE DIVERSIFIED THEY DIDN'T 
RELY LIKE THE NORTHERN ROCK ON ONE 
METHOD OF FUNDING LODS HAS A 
SIGNIFICANT LLOYD'S HAS A 
SIGNIFICANT RETAIL BASE AND THEY 
HAD A LOT OF MONEY TO PLAY WITH SO 
THEY FARED VERY WELL 
THEIR FINANCES ARE IN A STRONGER 
POSITION THAN RBS OR BARCLAYS BUT 
YOU CAN'T RULE OUT THAT THEY MIGHT 
APPROACH SHAREHOLDERS FOR MORE 
MONEY ONCE ONE OF THEM DOES IT 
ALL THE OTHERS FEEL UNDER PRESSURE 
TO DO IT 
THIS PROBLEM IS NOT OVER 
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO YES THEY 
MAY HAVE TO GO BACK RIGHT NOW 
THEY ARE IN A STRONG POSITION 
ANOTHER SIGN OF THAT PROBLEM NOT 
GOING AWAY THE PROBLEM OF THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH IS THIS NEWS FROM 
U. B. S. ANOTHER BIG LOSS FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION 
IN THREE MONTHS BUT WE WERE 
EXPECTING THAT 
THAT'S BETTER THAN 
WE WERE EXPECTING THE NUMBER 
SOUNDS SIGNIFICANT IT IS EASILY 
ABSORBED BY THEIR ORGANISATION IT 
IS NOT CRITICAL FROM AN INVESTMENT 
PROSPECTIVE THE BANK IS DOING 
RELATIVELY WELL COMPARED TO THE WAY 
THEY WERE DOING THREE MONTHS AGO 
ONE INTERESTING STORY YOU PICKED 
OUT OF THE PAPERS THIS MORNING IS A 
DEAL THAT U. B. S. HAS DONE TO SELL 
INVESTMENTS TO ANOTHER COMPANY AT 
LESS THAN FULL PRICE WHY IS THAT 
IMPORTANT 
IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IMPORTANT THE MARKET IS NOT THERE YET THEY 
HAD TO PROVIDE A TWENTY FIVE PER CENT DISCOUNT ON 
THE ACTUAL MORTGAGE PRODUCTS TO 
GET THEM SOLD AND THAT'S A 
SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNT UNTIL WE SEE 
THAT MARGIN REDUCING WE CAN SAY WE 
ARE STILL IN THE PROBLEM AREA 
RALPH SILVA THANK YOU FOR JOINING 
US US U. B. S. ALSO ANNOUNCING FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED JOB LOSSES 
WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT IF ANY 
ARE LIKELY TO BE IN THE CITY

COUPLE OF FACTS FOR YOU MORE THAN 
ONE IN THREE OF US WOULDN'T TRUST 
ANYONE ON OUR STREET WITH OUR KEYS 
AND ABOUT ONE IN FOUR OF US THINK 
OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD HAS BECOME LESS 
FRIENDLY OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS

RESEARCH WE WILL BE REVEALING IN A 
SERIES OF REPORTS ALL ABOUT 
NEIGHBOURLINESS NEIGHBOURLINESS JUST TO SHOW YOU BRIEFLY WE WILL 
BE TALKING TO THEM LATER THE 
NEIGHBOURS IN PEMBROKE STREET BUT 
BEFORE THIS WE WILL BE LOOKING AT 
STREET LIFE ELSEWHERE CHOOSE 
VERY TYPICAL STREET UP IN BRADFORD 
TO FIND OUT LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW MUCH WE TRUST THE PEOPLE AROUND US 
THIS IS BOLTON WOODS IN SHIPLEY 
WEST YORKSHIRE 
THE SHORT OF PLACE WHERE YOU WOULD 
HAVE THOUGHT EVERYONE KNEW ONE 
ANOTHER ANOTHER NOT ANYMORE 
EVERYBODY KNEW EVERYBODY YOU COULD 
GO IN PEOPLE'S HOUSES AND TALK YOU 
KNOW AND LEAVE YOUR DOOR OPEN 
WELL YOU CAN'T NOW CAN YOU 
IT CERTAINLY FEELS LIKE YOUR 
TYPICAL FRIENDLY YORKSHIRE STREET 
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE MATTER OF 
TRUST THERE ARE SOME WHO HAVE 
THEIR DOUBTS THESE DAYS

NOT INTERESTED IN TALKING TO ONE 
ANOTHER 
NO THEY ARE NOT SOCIALLY ANOTHER MINDED MINDED I WENT FOR WALK WITH BILL 
MITCHELL HE LIVED HERE ALL HIS 
LIFE BUT FEELS STRANGER ON HIS 
OWN STREET

CORONATION STREET OR EMMERDALE OR 
SOME TRAP AS THAT THEY WILL TELL

DO WITH THE PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM 
END END WE DON'T BOTHER 
YOU DON'T KNOW PEOPLE DOWN THERE

ONE DAY AND A COUPLE OF DAYS 
AFTERWARDS IT IS SOMEBODY ELSE 
THAT'S LIVING IN THERE

AND IT CARRIED ON 
DO YOU EVER CHAT TO THE NEIGHBOURS

LATER BILL EXPLAINED TO ME WHY HE 
HAD BEEN STAND OFFISH 
IT IS WHETHER YOU INTEGRATE AND 
PEOPLE DON'T INTEGRATE IN THE 
COMMUNITY COMMUNITY YOUNG PEOPLE HE FELT NO LONGER 
MADE AN EFFORT BUT IS IT THEIR 
FAULT THIS IS WHERE WE HAD BEEN 
STANDING EARLIER ONE OF TWENTY FOUR SHOPS 
THAT HAD GONE ALONG WITH THE 
VILLAGE'S CHURCH THREE MILLS AND 
LIBRARY AND DOCTOR'S SURGERY IT IS 
IT IS NOT A BAD PLACE AND BY MODERN 
STANDARDS FRIENDLY BUT THE THINGS

TENANCE THEY DO THE GARDENS AND

LOOKS AFTER EACH OTHER AND ONE OF 
THE KEY THINGS ABOUT THIS AREA IS 
WHAT A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND 
NEIGHBOURLINESS IS

VALUED AND IT MATTERS BECAUSE HAVE 
PEOPLE HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF

FIFTEEN THOUSAND TO YOU ARE DEAD TEN THOUSAND 
IN JUST ONE TOWN A HUGE RELIEF 
EFFORT GETS UNDER WAY IN BURMA 
AFTER A DEVASTATING CYCLONE 
GOOD MORNING IT IS TUESDAY SIXTH 
MAY ALSO AHEAD ON THE PROGRAMME A 
WARNING OVER BABY BOTTLES WE'RE 
ASKING THIS MORNING IF CHEMICALS IN 
THE PLASTIC COULD POSE A HEALTH 
RISK TO CHILDREN 
A HUGE INCREASE IN C. C. T. V. HAS NOT 
HELPED SOLVE CRIME A TOP POLICEMAN 
SAYS IT IS A CRIMINAL WASTE OF 
RESOURCES ALSO THIS MORNING 
DRUNK BRITISH COUPLE IN PORTUGAL 
ESCAPE CHARGES AFTER THEIR CHILDREN

WHAT PROMPTS HOLIDAY BRITS TO 
BEHAVE SO BADLY AND IN THE 
WEATHER IT WILL BE WARM DAY FOR 
MOST OF US WITH THE EXCEPTION 
BEING THE EAST COAST WHERE THERE IS 
A BREEZE SO IT WILL FEEL A LITTLE 
COOLER HERE AND JOIN US FOR 
BREAKFAST WITH NEIGHBOURS IN 
PLYMOUTH AS WE ASK ARE WE LOSING 
OUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBOURHOOD HABITS 
AT LEAST FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN 
THE CYCLONE DISASTER IN BURMA AND 
OVER FOUR THOUSAND MORE ARE MISSING 
CYCLONE NARGIS STRUCK ON SATURDAY 
AT SPEEDS OF TEN MILES AN HOUR 
WIPING OUT POWER AND WATER SUPPLIES 
TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN A 
SINGLE TOWN 
THIS IS COUNTRY TORN APART 
CYCLONE NARGIS HAS DEVASTATED LARGE 
AREAS OF SOUTHERN BURMA THE 
CYCLONE HIT AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILES PER HOUR 
SWEEPING ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST OF 
THE COUNTRY THOUSANDS ARE DEAD 
HOUSES FLATTENED TREES UPROOTED 
ROADS BLOCKED 
ONE EYEWITNESS TOLD THE B. B. C. WHAT HE 
SAW IN THE MAIN CITY OF RANGOON 
HUGE TREES HAD JUST FALLEN ON THE 
ROAD WINDOWS WERE SMASHED WE SAW 
HOUSES WITHOUT ANY ROOFS THERE 
WERE ELECTRICITY POLES ALL ON THE 
ROAD ALL SERVICES HAD JUST SHUT 
DOWN THERE WERE NO TAXIS AND 
OBVIOUSLY NO SHOPS AND PEOPLE WERE 
NOT REPORTING TO WORK 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN MADE HOMELESS BURMA'S 
ALREADY IMPROVE IRISHED AND 
ISOLATED BUT IN RAVE MOVE THE 
AUTHORITIES HAVE APPEALED TO THE 
OUTSIDE WORLD FOR HELP A SIGN OF 
THE SCALE OF THE DISASTER 
IMPOVERISHED BUT GETTING SUPPLIES 
TO THE CUT OFF AREAS WON'T BE EASY 
THE RED CROSS IS ALREADY TRYING TO 
GIVE OUT FOOD AND SHELTER THE 
ESSENTIAL FOR SURVIVAL BUT ALL THE 
ATTENTION IS ON TRYING TO REBUILD 
HOMES AND LIVES THE B. B. C. ONE NOT 
ALLOWED TO REPORT FROM INSIDE BURMA 
SO WE'RE JOINED BY DANIEL GRIFFITHS 
FROM BANGKOK IN NEIGHBOURING 
THAILAND FIFTEEN THOUSAND IS THE ESTIMATED 
FIGURE OF THOSE DEAD BUT ARE WE 
EXPECTING THAT TO RISE CERTAINLY CERTAINLY WE DO AND THE BURMESE FOREIGN 
HAS BEEN SAYING AS MUCH AS WELL 
SAYING THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE 
NOT MANAGED TO GET TO MORE REMOTE 
OUTLYING AREAS ROADS ARE BLOCKED 
AND COMMUNICATIONS ARE DOWN SO IT 
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET A FULL 
PICTURE AND THE NUMBERS ARE 
CHANGING ALL THE TIME WE'VE JUST 
HEARD FROM THAILAND'S FOREIGN 
MINISTER WHO WAS MEETING BURMA'S 
AMBASSADOR IN BANGKOK AND IT'S NOW 
THOUGHT THAT THIRTY THOUSAND ARE MISSING AND 
WE CAN EXPECT THE NUMBERS TO GO 
UPWARDS IN THE DAYS AHEAD AND AND WE'VE HEARD FROM THE RED CROSS THAT 
THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF 
VOLUNTEERS ALREADY INSIDE BURMA 
BUT TO HOW MUCH EXTENT ARE THE 
MILITARY AUTHORITIES CO OPERATING 
WITH OTHER AID AGENCIES 
THAT IS 
ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS HOW OPEN 
WILL BURMA BE CERTAINLY THE 
MILITARY AUTHORITIES HAVE SAID THEY 
NEED INTERNATIONAL HELP BUT IN THE 
PAST BURMA HAS BEEN DISTRUSTFUL OF 
THE INTERNATIONAL HELP AND AID 
AGENCIES SO THAT IS ONE QUESTION 
HANGING OVER THE OPERATIONS AND 
THE OTHER IS THE TERRAIN MANY 
PARTS ARE EXTREMELY REMOTE AND 
INACCESSIBLE AT THE BEST OF TEEMS 
AND NOW THEY ARE COMPLETELY CUT OFF 
ONE AID AGENCY WAS TELLING US THEY 
NEED BOATS AND PLANES TO GET TO 
THESE AREAS THEY THOUGHT THE 
OPERATION COULD LAST TWO MONTHS 
AND NOW THEY'RE PREDICTING IT COULD 
LAST TWO YEARS 
HERE THE HUGE 
INVESTMENT IN SECURITY CAMERAS HAS 
NOT CUT CRIME RATES ACCORDING TO 
THE HEAD OF C. C. T. V. AT THE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE D. C. I. MICK 
NEVILLE SAYS C. C. T. V. DOES NOT DETER 
CRIMINALS CRIMINALS WE THE MOST WATCHED COUNTRY IN 
EUROPE WITH AROUND FOUR MILLION 
CAMERAS FOLLOWING OUR EVERY MOVE 
THEIR MAIN JOB IS TO HELP DIRECT 
AND PREVENT CRIME BUT JUST HOW 
EFFECTIVE ARE THEY ACCORDING TO MR. 
NEFBL NOT EFFECTIVE ENOUGH HE 
SAYS ONLY A TINY PERCENTAGE OF 
CRIMES HAVE BEEN SOLVED USING C. C. T. V. 
AND THAT FAILURE HAS BEEN FIVE FIASCO 
HE WENT ON TO SAY 
SCOTLAND YARD HAS STARTED BUILDING 
A DATABASE WITH IMAGES FROM CAMERAS 
OF CRIMINALS AND UNIDENTIFIED 
SUSPECTS AND FROM NEXT MONTH IT 
WILL PUBLISH PHOTOS OF SUSPECTS IN 
MUGGING RAPE AND ROBBERY CASES ON 
THE INTERNET THE IDEA BEING THAT 
CRIMINALS WILL SEE THAT C. C. T. V. WORKS 
MAKING THEM LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT 
CRIMES THERE ARE THOSE THOUGH 
WHO REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
INCREASE OF SECURITY CAMERAS AND 
THERE ARE CALLS FOR ADEQUATE 
SAFEGUARDS TO BE PUT IN PLACE TO 
MAKE SURE ANY IMAGES STORED ON A 
DATABASE ARE USED ONLY FOR 
DETECTING CRIME 
POLICE IN FIFE HAVE CHARGED A FORTY NINE 
YEAR OLD MAN WITH MURDERING A 
BROTHER AND SISTER TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD 
MICHELLE THOMPSON AND HER BROTHER 
SEVEN YEAR OLD RYAN WERE FOUND IN 
A HOUSE IN BUCKHAVEN ON SATURDAY 
EVENING THE MAN IS EXPECTED TO 
APPEAR IN COURT LATER TODAY 
BREAST FEEDING HAS BEEN PROVEN TO 
RAISE THE I. Q. FOR CHILDREN A MAJOR 
NEW STUDY LOOKING AT FOURTEEN THOUSAND 
YOUNGSTERS FOUND THOSE WHO WERE 
EXCLUSIVELY BREAST FED DID BETTER 
THAN BOTTLE FED CHILDREN IN READING 
WRITING AND MATHS TESTS THE STUDY 
WAS CARRIED OUT OVER SIX YEARS BY 
CANADIAN SCIENTISTS FROM TODAY 
EMPLOYERS WILL HAVE TO PROVE THEY 
CAN'T FILL A POST WITH BRITISH 
WORKERS BEFORE INVITING FOREIGN 
WORKERS FROM OUTSIDE THE U. K. IF 
THESE MEASURES HAD BEEN TAKEN UP 
LAST YEAR TWELVE PER CENT FEWER WORKERS FROM 
OUTSIDE THE E. U. WOULD HAVE BEEN LET 
INTO THE COUNTRY 
THE ARMED FORCES REHABILITATION 
CENTRE AT HEADLEY COURT IS TO 
RECEIVE AN EXTRA TWENTY THREE MILLION TWENTY FOUR 
MILLION IN FUNDING AS DES BROWNE 
WILL ANNOUNCE LATER TODAY BRYN 
PARRY CAME INTO TO SEE US IN 
OCTOBER LAST YEAR AND SAID HE 
NEEDED TO RAISE MORE MONEY FOR THE 
REHABILITATION CENTRE AND HE'LL BE 
SPEAKING TO US IN A COUPLE OF 
MINUTES MINUTES INTERPOL IS ASKING FOR HELP TO FIND 
THIS MAN WHO HAS APPEARED IN EIGHT HUNDRED 
PHOTOGRAPHS ON THE INTERNET ABUSING 
CHILDREN OF SOUTH EAST ASIAN ORANGE 
ANYONE ANYONE ORIGIN 
THE BATTLE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC 
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IN THE 
UNITED STATES MOVES ON TO NORTH 
CAROLINA AND INDIANA TODAY OPINION 
POLLS ARE SUGGESTING THAT BARACK 
OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE NECK 
AND NECK IS NOT HER PICK UP TRUCK 
BUT HILLARY CLINTON IS ONCE AGAIN 
DOING ALL SHE CAN TO REACH OUT TO 
HER BASE WHITE WORKING CLASS 
VOTERS THIS TIME IN INDIANIAN AND 
THE MESSAGE ONE THAT SEE CAN FEEL 
YOUR PAIN AT THE PETROL PUMP AND 
THERE IS A MESSAGE OF HELP HILLARY HILLARY CLINTON WILL HELP YOU PAY AT THE 
PETROL PUMP SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
BARACK OBAMA CALLS IT BOGUS TAX CUT 
HERE'S THE CHOICE THE CLINTON CUT MIX THAT CAN HELP BIG OIL OR 
BARACK OBAMA AND A REAL ENERGY PLAN 
WITH TAX CUTS TO HELP FAMILIES 
TRULY PAY THE BILLS 
BARACK OBAMA 
HAS BEEN COURTING THE SAME WORKING 
CLASS WHITE VOTERS BUT SO FAR 
THEY HAVE TOEN CONVINCED AND THE 
ROW OVER HIS FORMER PASTER HAS NOT 
HELPED EITHER AND IT IS HILLARY 
CLINTON WHO IS CLOSING THE 
GOVERNMENT ONCE AGAIN AFRICAN 
AMERICANS WHO MAKE UP TWENTY PER CENT OF THE 
VOTES IN NORTH CARREO LENA COULD 
HELP DELIVER THAT STATE FOR BARACK 
OBAMA BUT HE DESPERATELY NEEDS TO 
BROADEN HIS APPEAL AMONGST THE 
WHITE WORKING CLASS IF HE WANTS TO 
END THIS CAMPAIGN QUICKLY THOSE 
ARE THE MAIN STORIES COMING UP 
WE'LL BE LOOKING AT WHETHER PARENTS 
SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF PLASTICS 
IN BABY BOTTLES SOME AMERICAN 
STORES ARE TAKING SOME BOTTLES OFF 
THE SHELVES AFTER WORRIES OVER SOME 
OF THE CHEMICALS IN THE PLASTICS 
HERE THE FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY IS 
SAKE THAT THE RISK IS VERY LOW AND 
POSES NO THREAT TO HUMAN HEALTH SO 
THEY'RE NOT TAKING THEM OFF THE 
SHELVES AND THE DIFFERENCE IS 
THIS IS A BOTTLE YOU CAN SQUEEZE 
AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT CHEMICAL 
B. P. A. IN SO WE'LL BE ASKING WHAT 
PARENTS SHOULD BE DOING NOW IF 
YOU'RE FEEDING FORMULA AND YOU'RE 
WORRIED ABOUT PUTTING VERY HOT 
WATER IN THE RIGID BOTTLES FIRST 
THOUGH SOLDIERS INJURED IN THE 
LINE OF DUTY ARE HOPING TO SEE 
THEIR FACILITIES AT HEADLEY COURT 
UPGRADED WITH A GRANT OF TWENTY FOUR 
MILLION THE CHARITY FOUNDED BY 
BRYN PARRY CALLED HELP FOR HEROES 
WAS AN OFFICER IN THE ROYAL GREEN 
JACKETS AND THANKS FOR COMING IN 
AGAIN I REMEMBER YOU COMING IN IN 
OCTOBER SAYING HOW MUCH MONEY WAS 
DESPERATELY NEEDED FOR HADLEY COURT 
WHAT SORT OF DIFFERENCE WILL TWENTY FOUR 
MILLION MAKE 
THAT WILL BE A 
TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IT IS MONEY 
FOR NECESSITIES SO IT WILL BE 
ACCOMMODATION AND MONEY FOR 
PROSTHETICS WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED 
IN ARE THE NICE TO HAVES SO WE'RE 
RAISING MONEY FOR A NEW SWIMMING 
POOL AND A GYM COMPLEX AND WE'RE AT 
FIVE MILLION ALREADY 
SO THIS WILL 
PROVIDE THE MONEY FOR THE BAESKS 
AND YOUR BIT WILL HELP BASICS AND 
YOUR BIT WILL HELP PEOPLE GET 
BETTER FAITHEST 
YES IF WE HAD TO 
WAIT FOR A SWIMMING POOL FOR 
GOVERNMENT MONEY TO BE AVAILABLE 
IT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN SO 
RATHER THAN SIT AROUND AND COMPLAIN 
WE DECIDE TO GET OUT THERE AND GIVE 
THEM SOMETHING SO WE CAN GIVE THEM 
THE SWIMMING POOL WHILE THE 
GOVERNMENT CAN GIVE THEM OTHER 
THINGS LIKE ACCOMMODATION DO DO THINK IT HAS TAKEN A WHILE FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT TO PUT THEIR HANDS IN 
THEIR POCKETS AND DO YOU THINK THE 
PRINCES HARRY AND WILLIAM GOING 
DOWN THERE HAS HELP 
I THINK IT HAS 
BEEN A GREAT HELP AND THE WHOLE 
MEDIA AND PRESS HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL 
AND THE COUNTRY HAS GOT BEHIND THIS 
DESIRE TO LOOK AFTER THE SERVICEMEN 
WHAT ASTONISHES ME ALTHOUGH I 
DOUBT IT WILL YOU BECAUSE YOU 
SERVED FOR SUCH A LONG TIME IN THE 
ROYAL GREEN JACKETS AND SAW SOME OF 
YOUR COLLEAGUES SERIOUSLY INJURED 
HOW MANY GO TO HEADLEY COURT AND 
GET LIMBS FITTED AND THEN WANT TO 
GO BACK INTO ACTION 
YES THEY ARE 
SOLDIERS AND THEY ARE FIT ONE 
SOLDIER SAID TO ME HE WAS NOT 
DISABLED HE'S JUST MISSING AN ARM 
AND IF THEY ARE NOT FIT FOR ACTION 
THEY WANT TO GO BACK TO DO OTHER 
THINGS THEIR LIVES ARE NOT OVER 
ONE CHAPTER CLOSE AND ANOTHER 
BEGINS 
IS HEADLEY COURT BIG BEGINS ENOUGH 
I THINK THERE IS IT IS AN ENOUGH EIGHTY TWO ACRE SITE THERE IS ROOM FOR 
MORE FACILITIES IF THEY ARE NEEDED 
IT IS AN AMAZING PLACE AT THE 
MOMENT IT IS A BIT RUN DOWN BECAUSE 
OF THE NUMBERS GOING THROUGH IT BUT 
WITH THIS NEW MONEY THEY WILL 
BRING IT UP TO A WONDERFUL STANDARD 
BUT THE ETHOS OF THE PLACE IS 
WONDERFUL IT IS INSPIRATIONAL AND 
WHEN YOU GO THERE YOU CAN'T HELP 
BUT BE HUMBLED BY WHAT THOSE PEOPLE 
ARE GOING THROUGH 
WELL THE MONEY 
FROM THE GOVERNMENT IS GREAT BUT 
WELL DONE FOR YOU GETTING TO FIVE 
MILLION 
YES THERE IS AN AMAZING MILLION NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE DOING 
THINGS THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND EVENTS AT 
THE MOMENT WHICH SHOULD BRING IN 
ANOTHER TWO MILLION ALL WE DID WAS 
STICK OUR HANDS UP AND SAY WE 
SHOULD DO SOMETHING AND THE WHOLE 
COUNTRY GOT BEHIND IT THAT THAT A LOOK AT THE PAPERS 
THE CYCLONE IN BURMA IS ON THE 
FRONT OF MOST OF THE PAGES AND THE 
DEATH TOLL HAS RISEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND AT 
LEAST AND A LOT OF THE PAPERS ARE 
POINTING OUT THAT IT IS SO 
INACCESSIBLE AND DIFFICULT TO GET 
TO AND WHEN YOU HAVE TREES DOWN 
YOU CAN'T GET TO THE VILLAGES TO 
FIND OUT WHO IS THERE AND WHO IS 
INJURED AND THE INDEPENDENT SAYS 
PIRAIA STATE MAKES AN 
UNPRECEDENTED PLEA FOR 
INTERNATIONAL HELP AND A COUPLE 
OF PAPERS ARE LEADING ON THE 
AUSTRIAN STORY AND THIS PAPER HAS 
WHAT IS CALLED THE BOY FROM THE 
CELLAR CELLAR AXIER FRETSLE WAS LEFT ON THE 
DOORSTEP BY THE FATHER AND HE HAD A 
TWIN BROTHER WHO DIED IN THE CELLAR 
THE SUN SAYING THAT CELLAR DAD 
RAPED HIS OWN GRANDCHILD 
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH SAYS ESTATE 
AGENCIES ARE CLOSING BRANCHES AT 
THE RATE OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY A WEEK FOUR THOUSAND JOB 
LOSSES SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR 
REMOVAL FIRMS LAYING OFF HUNDREDS 
OF STAFF BECAUSE TWENTY SIX PER CENT IS THE FALL IN 
THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES BEING SOLD 
THE DAILY MAIL M. P.'S WILL BEGIN A 
FIGHT TO CUT THE NUMBER OF 
ABORTIONS ABORTIONS AND THE PICTURE OF CHELSY DAVY 
HER ROYAL ENGAGE THE BUT NOT THAT 
SORT SORT SHE WAS THERE TO SEE PRINCE HARRY 
GET HIS CAMPAIGN MEDAL 
WHY DO SOME BRITS ABROAD SEEM TO 
LOSE CONTROL OF THEIR DRINKING WE 
WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT AFTER 
TWO DRUNKEN HOLIDAY MAKERS HAD 
THEIR CHILDREN TAKEN INTO CARE IN 
PORTUGAL PORTUGAL TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE RIVER AND THE 
BOATS IS CATASTROPHIC 
THE THE LOCH KEEPERS FACING 
REDUNDANCY AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF 
THEIR HOMES WE WILL LOOK AT WHAT 
IT MEANS 
WE HAVE HAD THE WORD GLORIOUS BUT 
WE HAVEN'T HAD THE S. WORD SCORCHI 
ARE O. 
SCORCHIO 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY 
SNOW SNOW IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE U. K. 
COMPARED TO YESTERDAY THERE IS 
MORE OF A BREEZE ALTHOUGH THE 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE HIGH THE 
BREEZE WILL TAKE THE EDGE OFF THEM 
NONETHELESS STILL VERY PLEASANT 
ON THE SATELLITE YOU CAN SEE THE 
BIG WEDGE OF OF CLOUD 
THIS MORNING ACROSS SCOTLAND WELL 
ACROSS THE NORTH AND THE EAST CLOSE 
TO THE COAST THERE WILL BELOW 
CLOUD AND SEA FOG AND INLAND THERE 
WILL BE CLOUD BUT BREAKS 
THE BREAKS CONTINUING DOWN TO THE 
SOUTH COAST THIS IS THE PICTURE AT 
NINE A M. AS WE SWING OVER TOWARDS THE 
SOUTH WEST WE ARE LOOKING AT 
SUNSHINE WITH WITH CLOUD AND THE 
SAME CAN BE SAID FOR WALES NOT A 
COLD START ELEVEN CELSIUS IN CARDIFF 
AS WE MOVE INTO NORTHERN IRELAND 
AGAIN AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE GOT A 
BIT OF LOW CLOUD AND MISTY 
CONDITIONS THAT WILL BREAK AND 
IMPROVE AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY 
AND HERE TOO WE WILL SEE SUNSHINE 
IT IS WORTH SAYING WE COULD JUST 
SEE THE ODD ISOLATED SHOWER ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND WESTERN 
SCOTLAND IF YOU DO YOU WILL BE 
UNLUCKY BUT IT IS NOT WITHIN THE 
REALMS OF POSSIBILITY THE CLOUD 
BREAKING GLASGOW SEEING THE 
HIGHEST TEMPERATURE AT TWENTY TWO CELSIUS 
THROUGH THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT 
AGAIN THERE WILL BE A GOOD 
CLEARANCE IN THE SKY THE LOW CLOUD 
WILL REFORM OVER THE NORTH EAST OF 
THE COUNTRY AND ALSO THERE WILL BE 
PATCHY MIST AND FOG OVER THE VALE 
OF YORK FOR MOST AGAIN NOT A COLD 
NIGHT NIGHT TOMORROW WHEN WE LOSE THE MIST AND 
THE FOG PATCHES THAT FORM OVERNIGHT 
AND THE LOW CLOUD IT WILL BE A 
LOVELY DAY 
GLORIOUS PLENTY OF SUNSHINE ON 
OFFER IN THE WEST MORE CLOUD AT 
TIMES WHICH COULD PRODUCE THE ODD 
SHOWER AND IF IT DOES IT WILL BE 
SHARP SHARP TEMPERATURES UP A DEGREE ON TODAY 
AND THURSDAY IS LOOKING PROMISING 
BUT A WEE BIT OF A BREAK DOWN IN 
THE SOUTH WEST WITH SHOWERY RAIN 
TIME TO HEAD BACK TO COLLECT CLAN 
AND FIND DECLAN AND FIND OUT 
WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE LONDON 
STOCK EXCHANGE 
RCHINGS 
YES WE HAVE THE REPORT INTO B. A. E. 
SYSTEMS YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THAT 
ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE ABOUT 
PAYMENTS THAT B. A. E. MAY OR MAY NOT 
HAVE MADE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES TO SECURE 
ARMS DEAL WITH THE SAUDI ARABIAN 
GOVERNMENT THE ALLEGED PAYMENTS 
WERE BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE 
SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE BEFORE THE 
INVESTIGATION WAS TERMINATED BY THE 
THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL LORD 
GOLDSMITH GOLDSMITH B. A. E. DECIDED TO SET UP A REPORT 
COMMISSION EXCUSE ME HEADED BY THE 
FORMER LORD CHIEF JUSTICE LORD 
WOOLF WOOLF THAT'S THE REPORT THAT HAS BEEN 
PUBLISHED WITHIN THE LAST FEW 
MINUTES NOW THE REPORT DOESN'T 
LOOK AT ANY OF THE ALLEGATIONS MADE 
ABOUT THE SAUDI SAUDI ARMS ARMS 
DEALS IT LOOKS AT BAE'S CURRENT 
ETHICAL STAND AND THE REPORT SAYS 
THIS IT SAYS B. A. E. HAS ALREADY MADE 
PROGRESS TO ESTABLISH HIGHER 
STANDARDS OF ETHICAL BUSINESS BUT 
GIVEN THE REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE IT 
HAS SUSTAINED THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE 
DONE IT MADE SERIES OF TWENTY THREE 
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF B. A. E. 
TO TIGHTEN UP ITS ETHICAL 
PROCEDURES SO THE REPORT INTO THE 
ETHICAL STANDING OF B. A. E. JUST 
PUBLISHED THERE ARE TWENTY THREE 
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THE CONCLUSION 
IS THAT IT THINKS THAT B. A. E. HAS MADE 
PROGRESS TO ESTABLISH HIGHER 
STANDARDS OF ETHICAL BUSINESS 
CONDUCT CONDUCT SHARES IN LONDON ON FRIDAY WERE UP 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
SEE YOU LATER 
LET'S BRING YOU MORE ON THE NEWS 
THE CHEMICAL FOUND IN PLASTIC BABY 
BOTTLES COULD AFFECT CHILDREN'S 
HEALTH IT PROMPTED CALLS FOR MORE 
INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN TO PARENTS 
NEW RESEARCH FROM THE UNITED STATES 
SAYS THE SUBSTANCE CALLED BISPHENOL 
A COULD CAUSE BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES 
IN INFANTS AND TRIGGER THE EARLY 
ONSET OF PUBERTY IN GIRLS BRITISH 
HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE THAT BOTTLES ARE UNSAFE 
IT IS THE LAST THING A PARENT WANTS 
TO WORRY ABOUT BUT A U. S. GOVERNMENT 
REPORT LAST MONTH RAISED CONCERNS 
ABOUT A SUBSTANCE FOUND IN BABIES 
BOTTLES CALLED BISPHENOL A 
SINCE THEN CANADA SAID IT WANTS TO 
BAN IT IN THE U. S. MAJOR CHAIN 
STORES INCLUDING WAL MART SAY THEY 
WILL STOP SELLING THEM AND HERE AS 
D. A. ARE INTRODUCING THEIR OWN 
FREE RANGE 
WE ARE GETTING CUSTOMER FEEDBACK 
THEY ARE SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING 
IN CANADA AND AMERICA AND WE ARE 
GETTING CUSTOMER FEEDBACK WITH 
REGARDS TO B. P. A. WE ARE PROVIDING 
CUSTOMERS WITH A CHOICE BY 
PROVIDING THE RANGE AND 
THE RANGE WE OFFER AS WELL 
WHAT IS B. P. A. IT IS A CHEMICAL FOUND 
IN MANY REUSABLE PLASTIC PRODUCTS 
LIKE THIS TESTS ON ANIMALS FOUND 
IT CAN AFFECT THE REPO DUCTIVE AND 
NEUROLOGICAL SYSTEMS 
THE FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY AND THE 
MANUFACTURERS SAY THE AMOUNT OF THE 
CHEMICAL IN IN PRODUCTS LIKE THIS 
IS BELOW LEVELS CONSIDERED HARMFUL 
AND THEIR ADVICE IS THE BOTTLE ARE 
SAFE TO USE A REPORT IN APRIL 
CAUSED SOME TO QUESTION THAT ADVICE 
BASED ON ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS IT 
STATES EXPOSURE TO LOW LEVELS OF 
B. P. A. CAN CAUSE CHANGES IN BEHAVIOUR 
AND THE BRAIN PROSTATE GLAND 
MAMRY GLAND AND THE AGE AT WHICH 
FEMALES ATTAIN PUBERTY IT 
CONCLUDES THAT 
THOSE CONCERNS ARE SHARED BY 
TOXICOLOGISTS HERE 
MAYBE THERE IS CASE TO RECONSIDER 
WHAT PEOPLE DO NOW AND SWITCH TO 
GLASS OR SWITCH TO PLASTIC 
ALTERNATIVES WHICH DO NOT LEACH OUT 
BISPHENOL A 
WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS A VERY CALM 
RATIONAL APPROACH TO THIS IN 
COLLABORATION WITH INDUSTRY AND IN 
COLLABORATION WITH EVERYBODY I 
THINK TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE AND 
THAT'S THE ATTITUDE OF THE 
AUTHORITIES IN CANADA AND IN THE U. S. 
THESE YOUNG MOTHERS HAD LIMITED 
KNOWLEDGE OF B. P. A. SOME KNEW NOTHING 
AT ALL ALL 
I DIDN'T REALISE 
THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
BOTTLES WITH THOSE CHEMICALS AND 
WITHOUT WITHOUT THERE IS SOMETHING IN IT AS CANADA 
BAN IT HAD I WON'T TAKE ANY 
CHANCES CHANCES U. S. AUTHORITIES SET UP TASKFORCE 
TO GIVE PARENTS MORE INFORMATION 
HERE THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN 
CRITICISED FOR NOT SUPPLYING ENOUGH 
ON BEHALF OF PARENTS WE ARE 
CONCERNED THAT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT 
NIM KNOW BISPHENOL A MIGHT LEACH 
OUT OF BOTTLES WE NEED CLEAR 
LABELLING PARENTS NEED TO KNOW OF 
THE RISK AND HOW TO AVOID T. 
THE NATIONAL CHILDBIRTH TRUST 
ADVISES NOT TO POUR BOILING WATER 
FOR FORMULA INTO A BOTTLE 
THEY SAY SCRATCHED AND DAMAGED 
BOTTLES SHOULD BE DISCARDED 
THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS RIGOROUS 
TESTING HAS HAS SHOWN BABY BOTTLES 
HERE ARE SAFE BUT IT IS FOLLOWING 
ALL NEW RESEARCH CLOSELY AND WILL 
REVIEW ITS ADVICE IF THERE ARE NEW 
FINDINGS FINDINGS THAT REPORT FROM KEITH DOYLE 
KEITH IS WITH US NOW 
HOW WORRIED SHOULD PARENTS BE THE THE THING ABOUT THIS IT IS A LIVE 
DEBATE IT IS ONGOING RESEARCH HAS 
BEEN CARRIED OUT IN THE UNITED 
STATES AND IN CANADA AND THAT'S 
WHERE THE CONCERNS HAVE COME FROM 
HERE THEY SAY THERE IS NO NO 
PROBLEM WITH THE BOTTLES TESTING 
HAS BEEN DONE IN BRITAIN AND IN 
EUROPE AND THE BOTTLES ARE SAFE 
THE REPORT IN AMERICA SAID THERE IS 
A POSSIBILITY IF THEY ARE NOT USED 
PROPERLY THE CHEMICAL CAN LEACH 
OUT AND CAN THIS CHEMICAL CAUSE 
ANY PROBLEMS THEY ARE SAYING MORE 
RESERVE NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THEY 
ARE ADOPTING THE BETTER SAFE THAN 
SORRY ATTITUDE 
HOW CAN YOU TELL WHICH BOTTLES HAVE 
BISPHENOL A AND WHICH DON'T MOST MOST OF THE BOTTLE THAT IS CONTAIN IT 
WILL HAVE A SEVEN IN A SMALL 
TRIANGLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE 
BOTTLE BOTTLE ANOTHER RULE OF THUMB IF THE 
BOTTLE CAN BE SQUEEZED LIKE THIS 
IF IT IS A SOFT PLASTIC IT 
PROBABLY DOES NOT CONTAIN THIS 
BISPHENOL A IF IT DOES CONTAIN 
BISPHENOL A THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE 
IS A PROBLEM WITH THE BOTTLE THERE 
IS A PROBLEM IF YOU POUR BOILING 
WATER INTO THE BOTTLE THAT CAN 
RELEASE MORE OF THE CHEMICAL THAT 
MAY CAUSE A PROBLEM IF YOU SCRUB 
THE INSIDE OF THE BOTTLE BOTTLE AND 
IT BECOMES SCRATCHED THAT'S ANOTHER 
WAY OF RELEASING THE CHEMICAL IF 
YOU WANT A B. P. A. FREE BOTTLE ASK THE 
RETAILER AND LOOK FOR THEM MORE 
AND MORE ARE COMING ON THE MARKET 
MORE MANUFACTURERS ARE SAYING THEY 
ARE BRINGING IN A B. P. A. RANGE AND 
WHATEVER BOTTLE YOU USE YOU SHOULD 
NEVER POUR BOILING WATER INTO IT 
YOU SHOULD CHECK FOR A LITTLE 
TRIANGLE 
YES THERE IS A SEVEN TRIANGLE INSIDE THE LITTLE TRIANGLE 
THERE WILL BE LOT OF PEOPLE CONCERNED CONCERNED IF YOU ARE MAKING FORMULA MILK A 
LOT OF US POUR IN BOILING WATER IN 
THE BOTTLE AND WAIT FOR IT TO COOL 
DOWN DOWN DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT 
THEY MIGHT BE WORRIED IN AMERICA 
AND CANADA BUT NOT HERE IF YOU 
HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS AND YOU WANT 
TO SEND US THE QUESTIONS KEITH CAN 
LOOK INTO WE HAVE ROSEMARY COMING 
ON LATER AND WE HAVE GOT THE 
NATIONAL CHILDBIRTH TRUST AS WELL 
AND FOLLOW THE LINKS ON THE 
BREAKFAST WEBSITE AS WELL

FOR THE PAPERS THIS MORNING 
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THIS STORY 
OVER THE WEEKEND ABOUT A BRITISH 
COUPLE IN PORTUGAL WHO ALLEGEDLY 
WERE SO DRUNK THEY PASSED OUT WHILE 
IN CHARGE OF THEIR THREE YOUNG 
CHILDREN WE ARE EXPECTED TO APPEAR 
BEFORE JUDGE TODAY STAFF AT THE 
HOTEL IN THE ALGARVE CALLED THE 
POLICE AFTER THE COUPLE COLLAPSED 
AND THEIR CHILDREN AGED ONE TWO 
AND SIX WERE TAKEN INTO TEMPORARY 
CARE APPARENTLY THEY COLLAPSED 
WHILE THEY WERE IN THE RECEPTION OF 
THE HOTEL AND THE CHILDREN WERE 
TAKEN AWAY FOR A WHILE IS IT ONLY 
BOOZEY BRITS WHO GET INTO A MESS 
LIKE THIS NIGH WE SPEAK BENEDICT 
WHO IS REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE 
FRENCH CHANNEL FOUR AND TOM PAUL 
FROM LONELY PLANET TO BE FAIR WE 
DON'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS AND WHY 
THEY PASSED OUT THEY SAID THEY HAD 
WOKEN UP VERY EARLY AND HADN'T HAD 
MUCH TO DRINK AND IT COULD HAVE 
BEEN THE HEAT TOM IS IT GENERALLY 
PERCEIVED THAT BRITONS MIGHT DRINK 
A LITTLE TOO MUCH WHEN ABROAD AND 
IT'S IN THE THE SAME WITH OTHER 
NATIONS 
TO BE FAIR IT IS NATIONS PERCEIVED AS A NORTHERN EUROPEAN 
PROBLEM AND MAYBE THEY FALL FOUL 
OF A LITTLE BIT OF THE HEAT AND 
OTHER MEASURES THAT YOU DON'T FIND 
IN THIS COUNTRY IT IS A DIFFICULT 
SITUATION AND SOME PEOPLE DO GET 
CARRIED AWAY 
SO WE'RE NOT USED TO 
THE HEAT OR GETTING UP AT THAT TIME 
IN THE MORNING AND JET LAG AND THAT 
SORT OF THING 
I THINK WE CAN BE 
CAUGHT A LITTLE COLD BY THAT SORT 
OF THING YES IT CAN HAPPEN DO DO THE FRENCH SEE BRITISH PEOPLE 
ARRIVING AND CROSS THEIR FINGERS 
AND HOPE THEY STAY AWAY FROM THEIR 
BAR FOR A WHILE 
I THINK IT WOULD 
DEPEND I THINK THIS HAS ALL BEEN 
A BIT EUPHEMISTIC THERE THE POINT 
IS IF IT IS A RESORT I'M SORRY 
PEOPLE KNOW IF THEY ARE GETTING UP 
EARLY IN THE MORNING LET'S NOT 
EXCUSES FOR THAT WE ALL GET 
TIRED YOU DO SHIFTS YOU KNOW 
ABOUT TIREDNESS AND IT IS LIKELY 
THAT YOU WOULDN'T BEHAVE LIKE THAT 
AND AS FAR AS MEASURES BEING 
GREATER IN OTHER COUNTRIES I'M 
SORRY I THINK THAT HAS ALSO CHANGED 
I SAW A REPORT ONLY TWO WEEKS AGO 
THAT THE MEASURES ARE BEING 
INCREASED HERE L. THINK THE PROBLEM 
IS IN THE SAME WAY THAT EXTENSION 
OF LICENSING LAWS WAS NOT GOING TO 
SOLVE THE PROBLEM HERE UNTIL YOU 
HAVE LET'S WIDEN IT LET'S SAY 
IN THE BEST SCENARIO THAT IT IS 
NOT JUST BRITS THE FACT IS YOU 
WILL FIND HEAT WHEN YOU GO TO HOT 
COUNTRIES WAKEY WAKEY AND IF YOU 
HAVE SMALL CHILDREN WAKE UP ONE 
TO SIX YOU NEED TO BE LOOKING 
AFTER THEM THIS ALL FUELS THE BAD 
SIDE ABOUT BRITISH PEOPLE ABROAD 
AND UNTIL THERE IS THIS DIVORCE AND 
DISCONNECT BETWEEN BRITAIN AND 
OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE YOU HAVE 
ALCOHOL AND DON'T HAVE FOOD THAT 
IS THE KEY FOLKS DON'T JUST HAVE 
A VERTICAL PUB WHERE YOU HAVE 
ALCOHOL ON ITS OWN INTRODUCE 
ALCOHOL IN SMALL MEASURES TO 
CHILDREN WHICH IS MY CASE AND 
THEN YOU DON'T GET THIS BINGE AT TWELVE 
THIRTEEN AND ONE 
AND HOW DO GET THAT 
MESSAGE ACROSS TO PEOPLE GOING ON 
HOLIDAY 
IT IS A CASE OF SAYING TO HOLIDAY PEOPLE LOOK EXPECTATIONS ARE 
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU ARRIVE IN A 
FOREIGN COUNTRY YOU WON'T SEE 
PEOPLE DRINKING TO EXCESS AND YOU 
WILL SEE PEOPLE DRINKING WITH A 
MEAL SO DO AS THE ROMANS DO AND 
USE YOUR COMMON SENSE 
YOU SEE 
PEOPLE ON THE COSTA BRAVA FOR 
EXAMPLE THERE ARE LOADS OF SO 
CALLED BRITISH PUBS ALL THE WAY 
ALONG THE FRONT STRIP AND YOU KNOW 
PEOPLE ARE GOING THERE AND LOADING 
UP ON THE ALCOHOL AND THAT IS THEIR 
HOLIDAY THE HOLIDAY IS TO SPEND A 
WEEK OR SO DRINKING EFFECTIVELY 
THAT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE OR IS 
IT 
I THINK THE SURPRISING IT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE YES IT IS THE 
PORTUGUESE AUTHORITIES ARE USED TO 
SEEING PEOPLE COMING IN WHO HAVE 
HAD A BIT TOO MUCH TO DRINK FROM 
BRITAIN AND OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL 
BUT THIS TIME THERE WAS FIVE LITTLE 
BIT OF A SURPRISE BECAUSE IT WAS A 
FAMILY INVOLVED AND IN THAT CASE 
WE SAY THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS 
INVOLVED INVOLVED MANY PEOPLE GO ON HOLIDAY ON THE 
LASH AND THEY KICK FREE AND WANT 
TO DRINK AND FRENCH PEOPLE DON'T 
SEE THE NEED TO DO THAT 
NO THEY 
SEE ALL THE RIOTING AND THE STRIKES 
AND THINGS AND FRENCH PEOPLE 
UNDERSTAND THAT WORK IS A MEANS TO 
AN END BUT WE'RE VERY GOOD AT 
PARTYING ON ALMOST A DAILY BASIS 
AND A MEAL IF YOU CAN GET AWAY 
WITH STILL HAVING WHICH YOU CAN'T 
REALLY NOW HAVING A TWO OR THREE 
HOUR MEAL THAT IS THE PAST BUT IF 
YOU CAN YOU RELISH THAT SO IT IS 
RELISHING THE ENJOYMENT OF BEING 
WITH PEOPLE L. THINK THERE IS STILL 
THE SYNDROME OF THE DENG DING BELL 
YOU HAVE TO GET IT IN AND YOU KNOW 
WHAT IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
IF THE U. K. SOCIAL SERVICES AND IF 
THE ALLEGATIONS ARE CONFIRMED AND 
THE FACTS THAT WE THINK ARE TRUE 
ARE TRUE IT MAY SEND A SHIVER DOWN 
THE SPINE OF SOME OTHER PARENTS AND 
IF IT HELPS CHILDREN NOT FIND 
THEMSELVES IN THIS SITUATION AND 
PARENTS THEN YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS 
GOOD THAT THE MEDIA HEARD ABOUT 
THIS AND APPARENTLY ONE OF THEIR 
FIRST QUESTIONS WAS WHERE ARE THE 
CHILDREN AND SECONDLY DO THE 
MEDIA KNOW ABOUT IT SO LET'S NOT 
VILIFY THOSE PARENTS THEY HAVE 
THEIR OWN PROBLEMS BUT LET'S HOPE 
THAT CHILDREN ARE NOT LEFT 
PARENTLESS IT IS ONE YEAR TO THE 
DAY THAT MADELEINE MCCANN WAS 
KIDNAPPED AND LET'S REMEMBER THAT 
AND THEY DON'T WORK AS HARD IN 
FRANCE DO THEY OH STEADY ON EYE 
I'M ONLY SAYING THAT TO WIND YOU UP 
THEY DON'T WORK AS MANY HOURS PER 
THEY DON'T WORK AS MANY HOURS PER WEEK DO THEY 
SIAN HAND THAT 
SPADE OVER NOW 
BUT YOU CAN WORK 
AND ENJOY YOURSELVES AS I KNOW YOU 
TWO DO WITHOUT ALCOHOL 
THE MAIN STORIES THIS MORNING 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE DEAD AND MANY 
MORE HOMELESS AFTER THE DEVASTATING 
CYCLONE IN BURMA RESEARCHERS IN 
AMERICA SAY CHEMICAL FOUND IN 
SOME PLASTIC BABY BOTTLES COULD 
AFFECT CHILDREN'S HEALTH PROMPTING 
CALLS FOR MORE INFORMATION TO BE 
GIVEN TO PATIENTS HERE ALSO COMING 
UP IN THE PROGRAMME 
THE STRAIN 
THAT WE'RE LIVING UNDER AT THE 
MOMENT WAITING TO HEAR THE NEWS OF 
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S VERY 
HARD ON US 
THE LOCK KEEPERS FACING 
THE LOSS OF THEIR JOBS AND THE 
HOMES THAT COME WITH THEM 
SO MANY QUESTIONS COMING IN ABOUT 
THE BABY BOTTLE STORY THIS 
RESEARCH CAME OUT IN AMERICA IT 
CAME OUT LAST MONTH WHAT HAPPENED 
IS THE FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY HERE 
IS SAYING THAT BABY BOTTLES ARE 
SAFE SAFE IN AMERICA AND IN CANADA SOME OF 
THE BOTTLES CONTAINING BISPHENOL A 
HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE SHELVES WE 
ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT MORE MORE 
INFORMATION ABOUT IT BUT WHAT WE 
ARE BEING TOLD THE FOOD STANDARDS 
AGENCY SAYS DON'T WORRY 
LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING SHOULD I 
STILL PUT BOILING WATER INTO 
BOTTLES SHOULD I PUT THEM IN THE 
STEAM STERILISER 
IF YOU PUT THE STEAM IN IT DONE 
MATTER MATTER IF YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL DON'T PUT 
BOILING WATER INTO THE BOTTLE 
DOCTOR ROSEMARY WILL BE AND THE 
NATIONAL CHILDBIRTH TRUST WILL BE

GOOD MORNING IT IS A BEAUTIFUL 
START TO THE DAY THE FORECAST IS 
SUNNY AND WARM IF YOU LIVE IN THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
IT WILL BE BREEZIER THAN YESTERDAY

OF THE YEAR 
AN THE SATELLITE PICTURE YOU CAN 
SEE THERE IS A LUMP OF CLOUD THIS 
GOES BACK TWELVE HOURS THAT'S THE 
CLOUD THAT PRODUCED THE RAIN RAIN 
IT HAS A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD ON IT IN 
WESTERN AREAS 
QUITE A LIT OF LOW CLOUD CLOUD 
LAPPING ON TO THE SHORE OF THE 
NORTH AND THE EAST OF SCOTLAND AND 
JUST THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND BUT 
MOST OF THAT WILL CLEAR

NORTHERN IRELAND AND WESTERN 
SCOTLAND MIGHT JUST CATCH THE ODD 
SHOWER IF YOU DO YOU WILL BE 
UNLUCKY DOWN THE EAST COAST TODAY 
THERE WILL BE MORE BREEZE SO THAT 
WILL MAKE IT FEEL COOLER 
TOP TEMPERATURES ABOUT TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO 
CELSIUS CELSIUS THROUGH THE COURSE OF THIS EVENING 
AND OVERNIGHT AGAIN A LOT OF 
CLEARANCE IN THE SKY THERE WILL 
BELOW CLOUD LAPPING ON TO THE 
SHORES OF THE NORTH AND THE EAST 
AND AGAIN THE RISK OF MIST AND FOG 
PATCHES ACROSS THE VALE OF YORK 
TOMORROW THEY WILL DISPERSE 
READILY AND FOR MOST OF US TOMORROW 
ANOTHER GLORIOUS DAY WITH A LOT OF 
SUNSHINE AND A LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD 
THE CLOUD IN THE WEST AT TIMES 
COULD BE THICK ENOUGH TO PRODUCE 
THE ODD SHARP SHOWER BUT 
TEMPERATURES STILL GOOD FOR THE 
TIME OF THE YEAR AND IT WILL 
CONTINUE SO DURING THURSDAY WITH 
THE EXCEPTION OF THE SOUTH WEST 
BUT WE WILL HAVE SHOWERY RAIN

DOING TO DEAL WITH THIS EIGHTY PER CENT OF ALL 
BUSINESSES SAY THEY HAVE NO POLICY 
FOR DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH IN 
THE WORKPLACE 
WE ARE JOINED BY THE PROFESSIONOR

LESS FRIENDLY AROUND QUARTER OF 
US THINK OUR STREETS ARE BECOMING 
LESS FRIENDLY 
THE OPPOSITE IS HAPPENING HERE IN

WELL IT IS BECAUSE THE NEIGHBOURS 
HAD A CHANCE TO CHANGE THINGS WE 
HAVE FEW OF THEM OUT AND YOU CAN 
SEE A FEW OF THEM HAVING BREAKFAST

A MINUTE L. CHOSE STREET UP IN 
SHIPLEY TO ASK A FEW NEIGHBOURLY 
QUESTIONS AND ABOUT THEM ABOUT 
THEIR STREET LIFE

GO IN PEOPLE'S HOUSES AND TALK YOU

YORKSHIRE STREET BUT WHEN IT COMES 
TO THE MATTER OF TRUST THERE ARE 
SOME WHO HAVE THEIR DOUBTS THESE 
DAYS DAYS PEOPLE AREN'T INTERESTED 
NOT INTERESTED IN TALKING 
TO ONE ANOTHER 
NO THEY ARE NOT 
SOCIALLY MINDED 
I WENT FOR A WALK WITH BILL 
MITCHELL HE LIVED HERE ALL HIS

AND IT CARRIED ON 
DO YOU EVER CHAT TO THE NEIGHBOURS

PEOPLE DON'T INTEGRATE IN THE 
COMMUNITY NOW

WE HAD BEEN STANDING EARLIER 
ONE OF TWENTY FOUR SHOPS THAT HAD GONE ALONG

EXACTLY AND EVERY DAY EVERY THIS HOUR THE PICTURE IS GETTING GRIMMER 
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING REPORTS THIS 
MORNING FROM BRITISH AID O. 
ORGANISATIONS INSIDE BURMA THEY 
RECKON THE DEATH TOLL COULD GO UP 
TO FIFTY THOUSAND THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME

ARE OPENING UP A SIGN OF HOW BAD 
THINGS ARE 
FOR THE MOMENT THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH 
MUCH MUCH THE HUGE INVESTMENT IN SECURITY 
CAMERAS HAS NOT CUT CRIME RATES 
ACCORDING TO THE HEAD OF C. C. T. V. AT 
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE D. C. I. MICK 
NEVILLE SAYS C. C. T. V. DOES NOT DETER 
CRIMINALS AND ONLY THREE PER CENT OF LONDON'S 
STREET ROBBERIES HAVE BEEN SOLVED 
USING THE FOOTAGE WE ARE THE MOST 
WATCH WATCHED COUNTRY IN EUROPE 
WITH ROUND FOUR MILLION CAMERAS 
FOLLOWING OUR EVERY MOVE THE MAIN 
JOB IS TO HELP PREVENT AND DETECT 
CRIME BUT HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THEY 
ACCORDING TO MR. NEVILLE NOT 
EFFECTIVE ENOUGH HE SAYINGS ONLY A 
TINY PERCENTAGE OF CRIMES HAVE BEEN 
SOLVED USING C. C. T. V. AND THAT FAILURE 
HAS BEEN AN UTTER FIASCO HE WENT 
ON TO SAY BILLIONS OF POUND HAVE 
BEEN SPENT ON KIT 
SCOTLAND YARD HAS STARTED BUILDING 
A DATA BASE WITH IMAGES FROM 
CAMERAS OF CRIMINALS AND 
UNIDENTIFIED SUSPECTS AND FROM 
NEXT MONTH IT WILL PUBLISH PHOTOS 
OF SUSPECTS IN MUGGING RAPE AND 
ROBBERY CASES ON THE INTERNET THE 
IDEA BEING THAT CRIMINALS WILL SEE 
THAT C. C. T. V. WORKS MAKING THEM LESS 
LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIMES THERE ARE 
THOSE THOUGH WHO REMAIN CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE INCREASE OF SECURITY 
CAMERAS AND THERE ARE CALLS FOR 
ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS TO BE PUT IN 
PLACE TO MAKE SURE ANY IMMANS 
STORED ON A 
DATA 
BASE ARE USED ONLY 
FOR DETECTING CRIME 
CRIME FROM TODAY EMPLOYERS WILL 
HAVE TO PROVE THEY CAN'T FILL A 
POST WITH BRITISH WORKERS BEFORE

WONDERFUL AND WHEN YOU GO THERE 
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT BE HUMBLED BY 
WHAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH 
HEADLEY COURT'S CURRENT WORKSHOP IS 
RUN OF THE MOST ADVANCED IN THE U. K. 
CREATING LIMBS FOR FIFTY PATIENTS 
SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX THE FUNDS FOLLOW PUB 
LIB PRESSURE AND REVIEW OF HOW 
BRITAIN TREATS ITS INJURED 
SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN WITH MANY 
ASKING WHY THOSE WOUNDED IN ACTION 
SHOULD BE RELYING ON CHARITY FOR 
HELP HELP BREAST FEEDING HAS BEEN PROVED TO 
RAISE THE IK OF CHILDREN A MAJOR 
STUDY FOUND THOSE BREAST FED DID 
BETTER THAN BOTTLE FED CHILDREN IN 
WRAEDING READING WRITING AND 
MATHS THE STUDY WAS RRY ODD BUTT 
BY CANADIAN SCIENTIST THE BATTLE 
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION MOVED 
TO IENDIAN THAT INDIANA TODAY 
THE LATEST POLL SUGGEST THAT BARACK 
OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE NECK 
AND NECK IT IS UNUNLIKELY EITHER 
CANDIDATE CAN WIN OUTRIGHT AND 
THAT MEANS THE FINAL DECISION WILL 
BE DOWN TO PARTY OFFICIALS THOSE 
ARE THE TOP STORIES LATER WE WILL 
FIND OUT HOW NEIGHBOURLY A NATION 
WE ARE DAVID SILLITO WILL BE 
MEETING THE LOCALS IN PLYMOUTH A 
CHEMICAL TOUND IF PLASTIC BABY 
BOTTLES COULD AFFECT CHILDREN'S 
HEALTH PROMPTING KAYE CALLS FOR 
MORE INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN TO 
PARENTS IT COMES FROM THE U. S. 
RESEARCH SUGGESTING THAT THE 
SUBSTANCE CALLED B. P. A. BISPHENOL A 
COULD CAUSE BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES IN 
INFANTS AND TRIGGER THE EARLY ON 
SET OF PUBERTY IN GIRLS BRITISH 
HEALTH FISHES SAY THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE THAT BOTTLE HERE ARE 
UNSAFE UNSAFE IT IS THE LAST THING PARENT WANTS 
TO WORRY ABOUT BUT A U. S. REPORT LAST 
MONTH RACED CONCERNS ABOUT 
SUBSTANCE FOUND IN BABIES BOTTLES 
CALLED BISPHENOL A OR B. P. A. SINCE 
THEN CANADA HAS SAID IT WANTS TO 
BAN IT N. THE U. S. MAJOR CHAIN STORES 
INCLUDING WAL MART SAY THEY WILL 
STOP STEL SELLING THEM AND HERE 
ASDA ARE INTRODUCING THEIR OWN B. P. A. 
FREE RANGE FPLGT WE ARE GETTING 
CUSTOMER FEEDBACK THEY SEE WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IN CANADA AND AMERICA AND 
WITH ARE GETTING FOOD BACK WITH 
REGARD TO B. P. A. WE ARE PROVIDING 
KUST HER WITH CHOICE BY PROVIDING 
THE B. P. A. FREE RANGE SO WHAT IS B. P. A. 
IT'S A CHEMICAL FOUND IN MANY 
REUSABLE PLASTIC PRODUCTS LIKE THIS 
THAT PREVENTS THEM SHATTERING 
TESTS ON AN M. A. S. SHOW IT CAN AFFECT 
THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS ALTHOUGH 
THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW IT IS 
RISK TO HUMANS THE FOOD STANDARDS 
AGENCY AND THE MANUFACTURERS SAY 
THE AMOUNT OF THE CHEMICAL IN 
PRODUCTS LIKE THIS IS WELL BELOW 
LEVELS CONSIDERED HARMFUL AND THEIR 
ADVICE IS THESE BOTTLES ARE SAFE TO 
USE BUT A REPORT IN APRIL BY THE 
U. S. NATIONAL TOXICOLOGY PROGRAMME 
HAS CAUSED SOME TO QUESTION THAT 
ADVICE BASED ON ALMALL EXPERIMENTS 
IT STAYS EXPOSURE TO LOW LEVELS CAN 
CAUSE CHANGES IN BEHAVIOUR AND THE 
BRAIN PROSTATE GLAND MAMMARIES 
GLAND AND THE AGE AT WHICH FEMALES 
ATTAIN PUBERTY IT CONCLUES THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT BISPHENOL A MAY 
ALTER HUMAN DEVELOPMENT CANNOT BE 
DISMISSED THOSE CONCERNS ARE 
SHARED HERE 
MAYBE THERE IS A CASE 
TO RECONSIDER WHAT PEOPLE DO NOW 
AND SWITCH TO GLASS OR PLASTIC 
ALTERNATIVES WHICH DO NOT LEECH OUT 
B. I. F. BISPHENOL A 
WHAT HAS TO 
HAPPEN IS A VERY CALM RATIONAL 
APPROACH TO IN IN COLLABORATION 
WITH INDUSTRY AND EVERYBODY I 
THINK IT TO TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE 
AND THAT IS THE ATTITUDE OF THE 
AUTHORITYS IN CANADA AND THE U. S. 
THESE YOUNG MOTHERS HAD VERY 
LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF B. P. A. SOME KNEW 
NOTHING AT ALL 
DIDN'T REALISE 
THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
BOTTLES WITH THOSE KEM KA 
CHEMICALS AND WITHOUT 
AS DAN D. A. HAS 
BANNED IT I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE 
ANY CHANCES THE U. S. AUTHORITIES HAVE 
SET UP A TASK FORCE TO GIVE PARN S. 
MORE INFORMATION HERE THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR 
NOT SUPPLYING ENOUGH 
ON BEHALF OF 
PARENTS WE ARE CONCERNED THEY DON'T 
KNOW THAT BISPHENOL A MIGHT LEECH 
OUT OF BOTTLES AN THEY DON'T KNOWS 
WHICH BOTS SO BEFORE WE DO 
ANYTHING ELSE WE NEED CLEAR 
LABELLING PARENTS NEED TO KNOW OF 
THE RISK AND HOW TO AVOID IT THE THE NATIONAL CHILDBIRTH TRUST ADVICE 
ADVICES NOT TO POUR BOILING WATER 
INTO A BOTTLE THEY SAY SCRATCHED 
AND DAMAGED BOTTLES COULD BE 
DISCARDED THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS 
TESTING HAS SHOWN BOTTLES ARE SAFE 
BUT SAYS IT IS FOLLOWING ALL NEW 
RESEARCH CLOSELY AND WILL REVIEW 
ITS ADVICE IF THERE ARE NEW 
FINDINGS FINDINGS THAT REPORT FROM KEITH DOYLE THANK 
YOU FOR COMING BACK TO ANSWER SO IF 
QUESTIONS THAT IS THE SYMBOL THAT 
SHOWS IF BISPHENOL A THIS CHEMICAL 
IT WILL BE IN THE BOT FUNDAMENTAL 
THAT IS ON THE BOTTOM OF IT THERE 
SO IF O. MANY QUESTIONS A LOT OF 
PEOPLE JAMES KATHY NICKY SAYING 
THEY USE STEAMSTER LIEDSER THEY PUT 
IN THE MICROWAVE E. WAVE IS THAT 
DANGEROUS 
WE HAVE TO SEPARATE IT DANGEROUS STERILISING AND MAKING UP THE FORM 
LA THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAY OF 
DOING IT THE KPHUST CHUST DOESN'T 
RECOMMEND USING A MICROWAVE FOR 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THESE BOTTLES 
AND STEAMER WILL BE FINE BECAUSE 
THE THE BABY ISN'T DRINKING THE 
LIQUID THAT ENDS UP IN THE BOTTLE 
WHEN YOU ARE MAKING UP A BOTTLE 
THAT IS WHEN THE PROBLEM S. THE RULE 
OF THUMB IS THAT HOT PLASTIC AND 
MILK SHOULD NOT TOUCH 
SO DON'T 
STERILISE BOTTLES IN A MICROWAVE 
UNLESS YOU HAVE A STEAM STERILIZER 
STEAMING IS O. K. 
BUT WHAT ABOUT 
WARMING UP MILL INCOME A MICROWAVE 
AGAIN THE NATIONAL CHILDBIRTH 
TRUST DOES NOT RECOMMEND USING A 
MICROWAVE FOR THIS THE PROBLEM IS 
IT CAUSES IT DOES HEAT IT EVENLY 
SO A PART OF THE PLASTIC COULD GET 
VERY HOT AND AND THE PROBLEM IS HOT 
PALACEIC THE KNOWN THE LEECH MORE 
OUT SO AGAIN THEY DO NOT RECOMMEND 
USING A MICROWAVE FOR THAT 
THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER WAY TO TELL 
IF THIS CHEMICAL IS IN YOUR BOTTLE 
IF THE CHEMICAL IS IN THE BOTTLE 
THAT IS NOT PROBLEM HERE HERE THEY'RE SAYING DON'T WORRY THE 
FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY ARE SAYING 
YOU CAN STILL USE YOUR BOTTLES YES YES THEY'VE BEEN RIGOROUSLY WITH THEM 
THE PROBLEM WITH THEM ACCORDING TO 
AMERICAN RESEARCH IS IF YOU PUT 
BOILING WATER INTO THE BOTTLE 
BOILING WATER AND THE PLASTIC 
SHOULD NOT TOUCH IF YOU CAN 
SQUEEZE THE BOTTLE IT PROBABLY 
DOESN'T CONTAIN IT 
IS THE FEELING 
THAT THE ADVICE MIGHT CHANGE I'M 
VERY CONSCIOUS THAT THIS ADVICE 
CAME OUT FROM THE STATES LAST MONTH 
IN CANADA THEY WANT ANY BOTTLES 
CONTAINING B. P. A. BANNED THEY'VE 
STARTED TAKING THEM OFF THE SHELVES 
IN AMERICA HERE THE FOOD STANDARDS 
AGENCY ARE SAYING DON'T WORRY DO 
YOU SUSPECT THAT MAY CHANGE 
THEY'RE WATCHING THIS SITUATION IN 
NORTH AMERICA VERY CAREFULLY 
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AMERICA IS 
THEY'RE RESPONDING TO CONSUMER 
DEMAND S. CONSUMERS ARE SAYING WE 
DON'T WANT THESE BOTTLES THAT IS 
WHAT WE ARE STARTING TO SEE HERE 
ASDA IS BRINGING OUT ITS OWN 
FREE RANGE A LOT OF THE 
MANUFACTURERS ARE SAYING THEY ALSO 
HAVE RANGE WE WILL SEE 
MORE AND MORE OF THAT 
WHAT ARE THE 
RISKS IF ANY WHEN YOU HEAT A 
BOTTLE IN A BOTTLE WARMER OR A 
BESPOKE BOTTLE WARMER 
A BOTTLE 
WARMER IS FINE RULE IS IT NEEDS 
TO GET OVER SEVENTY CELSIUS TO STERILISE 
A BOTTLE IT SHOULDN'T GO HOTTER 
THAN THAT THE RULE OF THUMB HOT 
PLASTIC AND MILK SHOULD NOT TOUCH 
WE HAVE ROSEMARY LEONARD COMING IN 
SHE'S COMING IN LATER TO ANSWER

NATIONAL CHILDBIRTH TRUST ARE 
COMING IN TOO IF YOU WANT MORE

WHERE IS HE 
I LEFT HIM WITH YOU 
MORE RESPONSIBILITY 
SHUT UP RAY RAY AND CYST FROM ASHES TO ASHES AKA 
ACTORS DEAN ANDREWS AND MARSHALL 
LANCASTER WILL BE JOINING US HERE 
IN THE STUDIO 
NOW THE WEATHER WITH CAROL 
IT WILL BE NICE ALTHOUGH NOT 
SCORCHO SCORCHO NOT SCORCHO YET IT WILL BE 
PLEASANTLY WARM ACROSS MANY PARTS 
OF THE BRITISH ISLES TODAY FOR THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS TEMPERATURES WILL 
RISE BY A DEGREE OR SO 
THIS MORNING THERE IS A FAIR BIT 
OF CLOUD FOR SOME OF US YOU CAN 
SEE ON THE SATELLITE PICTURE WHICH 
GOES BACK TWELVE HOURS THAT GREAT BIG 
LUMP THAT PRODUCED SOME RAIN 
YESTERDAY IT'S BEEN DRIFTING 
TOWARD THE WEST IT'S A WEAK 
WEATHER FRONT IT STILL HAS SOME 
CLOUD CONNECTED WITH IT BUT THE 
CLOUD WILL BREAK UP THROUGH THE DAY 
THE EXCEPTION IS THE NORTH EAST OF 
SCOTLAND WHICH WILL HANG ON TO LOW 
CLOUD THROUGH THE DAY 
AS WE MOVE FURTHER SOUTH THE 
NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND SEEING SOME 
LOW CLOUD THAT WILL BREAK UP 
QUITE BREEZY CLOSE TO THE EAST 
COAST THAT WILL TAKE THE EDGE OF 
THE TEMPERATURE YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
MOVE FAR INLAND WHEN WE GET INTO 
HIGHER TEMPERATURES 
INTO THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WE 
ARE LOOKING AT SUNNY BREAKS AS WE 
ARE IN WALES BUT STILL BITS OF 
CLOUD FROM THE WEAK FRONT FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND WE HAVE HAD A LOT 
OF LOW CLOUD AND MIST AND MURK BUT 
IT'S IMPROVING HAVING SAID THAT 
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE WEST 
OF SCOTLAND THERE IS A VERY LOW 
RISK YOU MIGHT CATCH A SHOWER 
THE OTHER THING TODAY IS THAT IT 
WILL BE BREEZIER IN THE SOUTHERN 
HALF OF THE COUNTRY IT WON'T FEEL 
QUITE AS WARM AS YESTERDAY 
NONETHELESS TWENTY ONE CELSIUS IS SEVENTY ONE 
FAHRENHEIT FAHRENHEIT THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT WE WILL 
SEE GOOD BREAKS IN THE CLOUD SOME 
MORE LOW CLOUD FORMING ALONG THE 
NORTH EAST COAST SOME MIST AND FOG 
ACROSS THE VALE OF YORK TOMORROW 
MOST OF THAT STUD CLEAR READILY IN 
THE MORNING THEN ANOTHER GORGEOUS 
START TO THE DAY WITH A LOT OF 
SUNSHINE ON OFFER 
OUT TO THE WEST WE WILL SEE MORE 
CLOUD AT TIMES 
THAT COULD JUST BE THICK ENOUGH TO 
PRODUCE THE ODD SHOWER 
THAT SHOWER COULD PROVE TO BE QUITE 
SHARP IN NATURE 
TEMPERATURES TOMORROW AS I 
MENTIONED UP A NOTCH ON TODAY WE 
ARE LOOKING AT TWENTY TWO CELSIUS AND TWENTY THREE 
CELSIUS THAT'S SEVENTY THREE FAHRENHEIT IN 
LONDON AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR 
THE AVERAGE IS SIXTEEN CELSIUS SO WE'RE 
WAY ABOVE THAT 
ON THURSDAY A FINE DAY WITH A LOT 
OF SUNSHINE THE EXCEPTION BEING 
THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WHERE WE 
WILL START TO IMPORT SOME SHOWERY 
RAIN A WEE BIT OF A BREAK DOWN

WOULD CONTEMPLATE OVER THE SUMMER 
WHETHER HE WOULD CONTINUE IN THE 
SPORT

ABOUT IT OVER THE SUMMER BECAUSE

BRITISH DRIVER BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO 
TEAM WE'LL KEEP YOU UPDATED ON 
WHETHER THEY'LL GET BACK INTO IT 
BUT THAT IS BAD NEWS AND OTHER 
INFORMATION FOR YOU LOOKING AT THE 
BACK PAGES OF VARIOUS NEWSPAPERS 
THIS IS THE TIMES CHELSEA HOLD OUT 
FOR A FINAL TWIST 
IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN TO THE LAST 
GAME AND GOAL DIFFERENCE AND ISN'T 
THAT EXCITING NO ACCORDING TO 
KEVIN KEEGAN HE CASE NO ONE WITH 
CHALLENGE THE TOP FOUR UNLESS THEY 
GET HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS TO CATCH 
UP AND THIS IS THE CURTIS CUP TEAM 
HOPING TO TAKE OWN AMERICA THEY 
WERE HOPING TO HAVE IAN POULTER 
DESIGNED CLOTHE BUT THEY'RE BACK 
IN BLUE AND WHITE 
GOING BACK TO KEVIN KEEGAN'S TOP 
FOUR 
YES HE SAYS CHELSEA FOUR MANCHESTER UNITED AND ARSENAL ARE 
WELL ABOVE THE OTHERS 
CAN YOU 
EXPLAIN THE DRAFT SYSTEM 
FROM THE 
SEASON BEFORE IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE YOU KNOW CHELSEA 
AND MANCHESTER UNITED ARE GOING TO 
END UP AT THE TOP AND THE LOOK AT 
THE ONES AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN 
YOU SAY O. K. THE TEAMS AT THE BOTTOM 
WILL GET ALL THE PEOPLE COMING OUT 
OF THE COLLEGES AND THE 
UNIVERSITIES THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS 
IN AMERICA BUT WE DON'T HAVE 
PEOPLE COMING OUT FROM THE UNITS 
AND THE SAME TIME TO SPLIT UP FOR 
EXAMPLE FLAMINI IN ARSENAL HE'S 
COME TO THE END OF HIS CONTRACT 
ARE ARSENAL GOING TO SAY I TELL 
YOU WHAT IT'S ABOUT TIME WICKHAM 
WANDERERS HAD SOME DECENT PLAYERS 
SO WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE PLAYERS 
COMING OUT AT THE SAME TIME AND WE 
DON'T HAVE RELEGATION THAT IS THE 
OTHER PROBLEM WE WERE GOING TO 
SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS BUT WE 
TRIED AND FAILED 
AND ANOTHER PROBLEM TO TALK ABOUT 
THIS MORNING A CHEMICAL FOUND IN 
SOME PLASTIC BABY BOTTLES COULD 
AFFECT CHILDREN'S HELP PROMPTING 
CALLS FOR MORE INFORMATION TO BE 
GIVEN TO PARENTS THE INFORMATION 
CAME OUT OF AMERICA SAYS THAT 
BUSINESS FEMALEAL A BISPHENOL A 
OR B. P. A. COULD TRIGGER EARLY BUBTY IN 
GIRLS AND AFFECT SOME CHILDREN'S 
HEALTH PUBERTY 
NO DOCTOR ROSEMARY SOME PEOPLE ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS WHAT IS YOUR 
ASSESSMENT OF IT 
HAVING SPENT A 
LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT THE BASIC 
SCIENCE BEHIND THIS I'M APLAYSED 
THAT THE CANADIANS AUTHORITIES HAVE 
DECIDED TO REMOVE THESE BOTTLES 
THE RESEARCH IS DONE ON ANIMALS 
ANIMALS HANDLE B. P. A. VERY DIFFERENTLY 
TO HUMANS SO IF ANIMALS INJEST B. P. A. 
THEY WILL GET HIGHER LEVELS THAN 
HUMANS DO SO I AM BE MUSED AS TO 
WHY THIS HAS HAPPENED IT SEEMS TO 
ME TO BE ALARMIST AND 
SCAREMONGERING THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE THAT THIS STUFF IS HARMFUL 
IN HUMANS AT ALL 
NO RECORDED 
CONSEQUENCES AT ALL NONE 
BUT YOU NONE KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE AS PARENT 
YOU HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND 
YOU THINK CAN I NO LONGER USE 
BOILING WATER IN THE BOTTLES OR 
STEAM THEM THERE IS NO SMOKE 
WITHOUT FIRE THE ANSWER IS 
FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS AND 
ADVICE YOU HAVE BEEN GIVING OUT 
THIS MORNING BUT IF YOU WERE ONE 
OF THE MILLIONS OF MOTHERS WHO HAVE 
PROBABLY BEEN USING BOTTLES WITH 
P. B. A. AND THEY ARE PROBABLY SCRATCHED 
AND YOU'VE PUT BOILING WATER IN 
THEM THE CHANCES ARE YOU WILL HAVE 
DONE YOUR CHILDREN NO HARM 
WHATSOEVER BUT FROM NOW ON FOLLOW 
THE GUIDELINES DO YOU THINK THERE 
SHOULD BE MORE INFORMATION FOR 
PARENTS ON THESE BOTTLES YES YES EXACTLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE BETTER 
LABELLING ON THESE BOTTLES YOU'VE 
GOT THE PICTURE UP THERE THAT THAT SYSTEM IF IT HAS B. P. A. ON THE BOTTLE 
IS THAT SYMBOL ALWAYS PRESENT YES YES SO IF THERE IS B. P. A. IN BOTTLE 
THAT SYMBOL IS ALWAYS ON THE 
BOTTLE 
THAT IS THE SYMBOL FOR IT BOTTLE SOME OF THEM IT MAY BE PRESENT 
BUT IT IS NOT ALWAYS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AND THE 
OTHER THING ABOUT B. P. A. IS IT IS IN 
LOT OF OTHER THINGS LIKE TABLEWARE 
AND PLASTIC PICNIC WARE CLEAR 
HARD PLASTIC OTHER THAN UNIONIST 
BABIES' BOTTLES 
SO IF YOU HAVE A 
BOTTLE YOU CAN SQUEEZE LIKE THAT 
IT IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE B. P. A. IN IT 
YES B. P. A. IS PUT IN TO MAKE THE 
PLASTIC HARDER AND SHATTER PROOF 
SO IF IT IS SQUEEZEY IT'S UP LIKELY 
TO HAVE IT 
AND AS LONG AS YOU 
DON'T PUT BOILING WATER IN A B. P. A. 
BOTTLE IT'S NOT A PROBLEM YES YES AND IF IT IS SCRATCHED AND OLD 
THROW IT AWAY AND THE OTHER 
MESSAGE IS DON'T KEEP BOTTLES FOR 
MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AND DON'T 
KEEP BOTTLES FOR BABY NUMBER TWO 
WHICH IS WHAT I DID BECAUSE 
THEY'RE EXPENSIVE BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR 
FIRST BABY THROW THEM AWAY AND FOR 
THE NEXT BABY GET ANOTHER LOT AND AND THIS E. MAIL SAYS SHE LETS THE WATER 
COOL AFTER BOILING IN THE KETTLE 
NOT THE BOTTLE BEFORE MIXING UP THE 
FORMULA BUT IS WORRIED ABOUT 
STEAMING THE FORMULA 
THERE ARE TWO 
DIFFERENT TIMES THEY SHOULD BE 
SAFE BECAUSE THE MILK IS NOT COMING 
INTO CONTACT WITH A HOT BOTTLE OH SEVEN OH SEVEN DEGREES IS THE TEMPERATURE ABOVE 
WHICH YOU GET STERILISATION AND 
BETWEEN OH SEVEN DEGREES AND BOILING 
POINT IS O. K. 
YES A DISH WASHER OH SEVEN 
DEGREES IS THE HOTTEST TEMPERATURE 
SO THEY ARE SAFE ANY WAY YES EVEN YES EVEN IF THERE WAS SMALL RISK YOU 
WOULDN'T USE THE WATER FROM THE 
DISH WASHER OR THE WATER THAT 
COLLECTS IN A STERILISER TO FEED 
YOUR BABY 
NO AND IF THERE IS A 
FORMULA TO MAKE UP DON'T PUT LARGE 
SCOOPS IN ALWAYS FLATTEN THE SCOOP 
AND BOIL THE KETTLE AND WAIT FOR IT 
TO PUT IT IN THE BOTTLE 
A VIEWER E. MAILED TO SAY IS THERE 
ANY WAY SHE CAN GET A LIST OF THE 
BOTTLES WITH B. P. A. 
NO SUCH THING AT 
THE MOMENT 
ASDA ARE PLANNING TO BRING OUT 
FREE BOTTLE AS SOON AS 
THEY ARE 
AVAILABLE IF YOU ARE BUYING NEW 
BOTTLES BUY ONE WITHOUT THAT 
SYMBOL SYMBOL ROSEMARY YOU LOOKED AT THE 
RESEARCH AND YOU ARE SAYING EVEN 
THOUGH THEY HAVE TAKEN THEM OFF THE 
SHELVES IN AMERICA AND CANADA 
DON'T WORRY 
IF YOU HAVE GOT A 
NEWBORN BABY AND USING BOTTLES AND 
THEY HAPPEN TO BE HARD AND SHATTER 
PROOF DO NOT WORRY IN MY OPINION 
AND IN THE OPINION OF THE BRITISH 
AND EUROPEAN AUTHORITIES THERE IS 
NO NEED TO STOP USING THESE BOTTLES 
YOU DO NOT NOT NEED TO THROW THEM 
AWAY AND GO AND GET A LOAD OF 
SQUEEZY OR GLASS ONES 
IT IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE WE HOPE 
TO HAVE CLEARED IT UP 
IF YOU WANT MORE INFORMATIONKS 
FOLLOW THE LINKS ON THE BREAKFAST 
WEBSITE WEBSITE I GOT IN TROUBLE FOR CALLING THEM 
THE N. C. T. 
THE NATIONAL CHILDBIRTH TRUST 
NOW THE WEATHER 
IT IS C. K. 
NOW THE WEATHER IT IS C. K. 
IT IS C. K. YES SIAN WE ARE LOOKING AT FINE 
WEATHER OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS THE 
FORECAST FOR TODAY IS WARM AND A 
SUNNY ONE AND TOMORROW THE 
TEMPERATURE WILL BE UP TOUCH ON 
WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING TODAY 
ON THE SATELLITE PICTURE YOU CAN 
SEE HOW MUCH CLOUD THERE HAS BEEN 
IN THE LAST TWELVE HOURS AND THIS 
CLOUD ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES HAS 
PRODUCED SOME RAIN AND THAT HAS 
BEEN MOVING WESTWARDS IT IS A WEAK 
WEATHER FRONT AND IT IS STILL WITH 
US AND THERE IS CLOUD ATTACHED TO 
IT IT FOR SCOTLAND THERE IS CLOUD AROUND 
LOW CLOUD REALLY LINGERING ACROSS 
THE FAR NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND AND 
AT TIMES THERE MAYBE CLOUD 
LINGERING OVER THE NORTH EAST OF 
ENGLAND FOR MANY PARTS OF ENGLAND 
WE ARE LOOKING AT A FINE DAY A LOT 
OF SUNSHINE IT IS BEAUTIFUL IN 
LONDON AND IT FEELS WARM 
INTO THE SOUTH WEST A SIMILAR 
STORY WE WILL HAVE SUNSHINE A 
LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD AND AND LITTLE 
BIT OF CLOUD ACROSS WALES FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND AFTER A DULL 
START THINGS IMPROVING THROUGH THE 
DAY WITH SUNSHINE HERE TOO IT IS 
WORTH MENTIONING THAT FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND WESTERN SCOTLAND THERE IS 
A SMALL RISK OF AN ISOLATED SHOWER 
DOWN THE EAST COAST BREEZY LIKE 
YESTERDAY THAT WILL TAKE THE EDGE 
OF THE TEMPERATURES IN NEWCASTLE 
THE TEMPERATURE TODAY REACHING EIGHTEEN 
CELSIUS CELSIUS THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
AGAIN THERE WILL BE A LOT OF 
CLEARANCE IN THE SKY THROUGH THE 
COURSE THE NIGHT WE WILL SEE LOW 
CLOUD AND PATCHING FOG 
AND PROBABLY AROUND ABOUT THE VALE 
OF YORK WE WILL SEE MIST AND FOG 
BUT NOTHING TOO SIGNIFICANT MOST 
OF THAT WILL CLEAR TOMORROW AND 
TOMORROW ANOTHER CRACKING DAY WITH 
A LOT OF SUNSHINE 
THROUGH THE DAY THERE WILL BE MORE 
CLOUD DEVELOPING IN WESTERN AREAS 
AND THAT COULD PRODUCE AGAIN JUST 
THE ODD SHOWER HERE AND THERE BUT 
IT WILL BE SHARP IF YOU CATCH ONE 
TEMPERATURES UP A TOUCH TWENTY THREE 
CELSIUS CELSIUS ON THURSDAY MORE FINE WEATHER FOR 
MOST OF US AGAIN A LOT OF 
SUNSHINE SUNSHINE THE EXCEPTION TO THAT IS THROUGH 
THE DAY WE WILL SEE SHOWERY RAIN 
ARRIVE IN THE SOUTH WEST 
SOLDIERS INJURED IN THE LINE OF 
DUTY WOUNDED ARE HOPING TO SEE 
THEIR REWHAT PILL REHABILITATION 
CENTRE AT HEADLEY COURT UPGRADED 
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER BRYN PARRY HE 
WAS AN ARMY OFFICER FOR TEN YEARS 
AND HE WAS SPEARHEADING THE 
CAMPAIGN FOR MORE MONEY AND JOINS 
US NOW 
HELLO HELLO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
WE WERE TALKING TO YOU LAST OCTOBER 
AND YOU WERE SAYING THIS PLACE 
NEEDS MORE MONEY THIS TWENTY FOUR MILLION 
INJECTION OF CASH WHICH IS COMING 
FROM THE GOVERNMENT WHAT 
DIFFERENCE WILL IT MAKE TO HEADLEY 
COURT 
IT IS FANTASTIC COURT IT IS GOING TO PROVIDE THE 
NECESSITIES SO UPGRADE THE 
NECESSITIES WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING 
THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT HOW THEY 
BEST LOOK AFTER THE WOUNDED AND 
THEY HAVE DECIDED THAT HEADLEY 
COURT IS WORTH THE INVESTMENT IT 
WILL DO ALL THE THINGS LIKE 
ACCOMMODATION AND THE PROSTHETICS 
DEPARTMENT WE ARE INTERESTED IN 
THE SWIMMING POOL AND THE NEW GYM 
DO YOU THINK THIS WOULD HAVE 
HAPPENED WITHOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN 
I WOULDN'T DREAM OF ANSWERING THAT 
QUESTION QUESTION OR LET'S FACE IT WITHOUT PRINCES 
WILLIAM AND HARRY WHO WENT DOWN AND 
GAVE BOOST TO THE CAMPAIGN LAST LAST SUMMER PEOPLE WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT 
THE WOUNDED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T 
APPROVE OF THE WAR AND DIDN'T KNOW 
ABOUT THE SOLDIERS WE CAME ALONG 
AND WANT TODAY DO SOMETHING WE 
OPENED THE FLOODGATES AND OVER THE 
COUNTRY PEOPLE HAVE STARTED DOING 
THINGS EVENTS ALL OVER THE 
COUNTRYSIDE WILLIAM AND HARRY 
EVERYTHING AND PEOPLE NOW HAVE 
REALISED THAT THE SERVICEMEN SERVES 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH WAR HE 
FIGHTS IN IF HE GETS WOUNDED WE 
WANT TO LOOK AFTER HIM 
THERE HAS BEEN THE SENSE OVER THE 
PAST COUPLE OF YEARS FROM WITHIN 
THE FORCES THAT PEOPLE WHO GO INTO 
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN FELT 
UNDERAPPRECIATED AND IT HAS TAKEN 
LONG TIME PEOPLE NEEDED AN OUTLOOK 
TO SHOW THEIR APPRECIATIONS 
PEOPLE STARTED TALK BEING IT THE 
CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF STARTED TO 
TALK ABOUT THE HOME COMING PARADES 
AND THERE HAS BEEN AN IMPETUS WE 
HAVE SEEN THE MOST INCREDIBLE 
REACTION THE FACT THAT WE HAVE 
RAISED SEVEN MILLION IN FIVE MONTHS 
YOU CAME ON SAYING YOU WANTED FIVE 
MILLION THAT WAS IN OCTOBER TO 
RAISE SEVEN MILLION IS ASTONISHING 
IF ALL THE EVENTS HAPPENING DURING 
THE SUMMER COME N. THAT'S ANOTHER TWO 
MILLION WE HAVE GOT TO GET THE 
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST 
ARMS AND LEGS THEY HAVE GOT TO 
HAVE A FUTURE 
MANY OF THEM WANT TO GO BACK IN YES YES THAT PERSON UP THERE HE IS COMING 
ON OUR BIKE RIDE HE LOST HIS LEFT 
LEG ON IN A LAND MINE AT THE END 
OF NEXT MONTH HE WILL BE RIDING THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
MILES ON A BICYCLE THROUGH FRANCE 
MOST OF THEM WANT TO GO BACK TO 
ACTIVE SERVICE 
THEY ARE NORMAL 
BLOKES AS ONE SAID I'M NOT 
DISABLED I JUST HAVEN'T GOT AN 
ARM THEY ARE FIT GUYS AND THEY 
WANT TO FEEL THE WIND IN THEIR FACE 
AND GO BACK WITH THEIR MATES 
YOUR CAMPAIGN IS CALLED HELP FOR 
HEROES HEROES THRAS WEBSITE THERE IS A WEBSITE 
THEY CAN COME TO SAINT PAUL'S TOMORROW 
NIGHT AND THEY CAN COME TO 
WHITEHALL ON THE SST JUNE AND FIRST 
JUNE AND GIVE RIDE OF APPLAUSE TO 
SAM AS HE RIDES BACK FROM FRANCE 
OUR THEME IS TO REMEMBER THE FALLEN 
BUT CARE FOR THE LIVING AND IF 
PEOPLE CAN SHOW THEIR SUPPORT THAT 
WOULD BE WONDERFUL 
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
THANK YOU 
NOW WOULD YOU LEAVE YOUR HOUSE 
KEYS WITH THE PERSON NEXT DOOR 
APPARENTLY ONE IN THREE OF US WOULD 
NOT PERHAPS YOU JUST WAVE TO THEM 
AS YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE MAYBE YOU 
DON'T KNOW WHO LIVES ON YOUR STREET 
THIS WEEK BREAKFAST WILL BE ASKING 
HOW NEIGHBOURLY A NATION WE ARE 
TO KICK IT OFF DAVID SILLITO IS 
ASSESSING THE SPIRIT AND EATING 
BACON SANDWICHES IN PLYMOUTH 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
WELCOME TO FRIENDLY NEIGHBOURHOOD 
THANK YOU FOR MY COFFEE THEY HAVE 
LAID ON BREAKFAST FOR US AND WHAT 
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WELL WOULD 
YOU BELIEVE AROUND ABOUT ONE IN 
FOUR OF US BELIEVE OUR 
NEIGHBOURHOOD HAS OVER THE LAST 
FIVE YEARS BECOME LESS FRIENDLY A 
THIRD OF US WOULD NOT LEAVE OUR 
KEYS WITH ANYONE ON OUR STREET 
THIS IS RESEARCH WE HAVE HAD 
CARRIED OUT BY I. C. M. AND THIS IS THE 
FIRST IN SERIES OF REPORTS LOOK 
AT NEIGHBOURLINESS IN BRITAIN 
IN A MOMENT WE WILL BE CHAT TO GO 
EVERYONE TO WORK WORK OUT WHAT'S 
GONE RIGHT BUT FIRST A REPORT 
LOOKING AT AN AVERAGE STREET CHOSEN 
ALMOST AT RANDOM IN SHIPLEY IN WEST 
YORKSHIRE JUST TO ASK THE PEOPLE 
PEOPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY 
THINK ABOUT THEIR STREET LIFE 
THIS IS BOLTON WOODS IN SHIPLEY 
WEST YORKSHIRE 
THE SHORT OF PLACE WHERE YOU WOULD 
HAVE THOUGHT EVERYONE KNEW ONE 
ANOTHER ANOTHER NOT ANYMORE 
EVERYBODY KNEW EVERYBODY YOU COULD 
GO IN PEOPLE'S HOUSES AND TALK YOU 
KNOW AND LEAVE YOUR DOOR OPEN OH 
YOU CAN'T NOW THOUGH CAN YOU 
IT FEELS LIKE YOUR TYPICAL FRIENDLY 
YORKSHIRE STREET BUT WHEN IT COMES 
TO THE MATTER OF TRUST THERE ARE 
SOME WHO HAVE THEIR DOUBTS THESE 
DAYS DAYS PEOPLE AREN'T INTERESTED 
NOT INTERESTED IN TALKING TO ONE 
ANOTHER 
NO THEY ARE NOT SOCIALLY ANOTHER MINDED MINDED I WINT FOR WALK WITH BILL 
MITCHELL HE LIVED HERE ALL HIS 
LIFE BUT FEELS STRANGER ON HIS 
OWN STREET 
YOU ASK ANYBODY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN 
THE VILLAGE I DON'T KNOW BUT 
YOU ASK THEM WHAT HAPPENED ON 
CORONATION STREET OR EMMERDALE OR 
SOME SUCH TRAP AS THAT AND THEY'LL 
TELL YOU THEY'LL TELL YOU 
IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY DO YOU KNOW WHO LIVES IN ANY OF 
THESE HOUSES 
NO I HAVEN'T A CLUE 
BUT THIS IS THE STREET YOU LIVED IN 
ALL YOUR LIFE 
I KNOW AND I STILL 
HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE 
ACROSS THE ROAD MONA HAS NOTHING TO 
DO WITH THE PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM 
END END DOWN THERE WE WE DON'T BOTHER 
PMENT 
YOU DON'T KNOW PEOPLE DOWN PMENT THERE THERE NO NO NO YOU CAN SEE ONE PERSON 
ONE DAY AND A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER 
IT IS SOMEONE ELSE THAT'S LIVING IN 
THERE THERE NO I DON'T KNOW HIM 
BILL BILL YES YES CAN YOU COME DOWN HERE 
I I THOUGHT I WOULD INTRODUCE BILL 
TO HIS NEIGHBOURS 
HOW MANY YEARS HAVE YOU LIVED ON 
THE STREET SARA LIVED HERE FOR A 
YEAR OR SO AND BILL FOR SEVENTY BUT 
THIS WAS THEIR FIRST HELLO 
HOW COME YOU TWO NEVER SAID HELLO 
OR MET BEFORE 
GOD KNOWS 
I DON'T KNOW 
CORDIAL BUT NOT REALLY FRIENDLY 
BILL WAS UNCOMFORTABLE 
THEN I SPOKE TO THE NEIGHBOUR NEXT 
DOOR AGAIN THE SAME STORY 
YOU KEEP YOURSELF TO YOURSELF THEN 
YES I KEEP MYSELF TO MYSELF 
DO YOU EVER CHAT TO THE NEIGHBOURS 
NOT REALLY 
LATER BILL EXPLAINED TO ME WHY HE 
HAD BEEN A BIT STAND OFFISH 
IT IS WHETHER YOU INTEGRATE AND 
PEOPLE DON'T INTEGRATE IN THE 
COMMUNITY NOW 
YOUNG PEOPLE HE FELT NO LONGER 
MADE AN EFFORT BUT IS IT THEIR 
FAULT THIS IS WHERE WE HAD BEEN 
STANDING ONE OF TWENTY FOUR SHOPS THAT HAVE 
GONE ALONG WITH THE CHURCH THREE 
CHAPELS FOUR MILLS LIBRARY AND 
DOCTOR'S SURGERY 
IT IT IS NOT BAD PLACE AND BY 
MODERN STANDARDS FRIENDLY BUT THE 
PLACES PEOPLE MET AND THE THINGS 
THEY DID TOGETHER HAVE SLOWLY 
EBBED AWAY 
HERE WE ARE IN PEMBROKE STREET ALL 
THE NEIGHBOURS HAVE COME OUT AND 
JOINED US THIS MORNING WHY 
WELL THIS IS SA NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT 
HAD AMAZING TRAN FORMATION OVER THE 
YEARS BECAUSE ALL THE RESIDENTS 
WERE INVOLVED IN WELL COMPLETELY 
DOING THE PLACE UP THEY RECEIVED 
PUBLIC MONEY AND THEY ARE VERY MUCH 
INVOLVED IN RUNNING THE PLACE AT 
THE MOMENT 
THE QUESTION EVERYONE HOW MANY 
PEOPLE WOULD YOU TRUST TRUST WITH 
YOUR KEYS AROUND HERE 
HALF A DOZEN 
WHO HAVE A A DOZEN 
I THINK MORE PROBABLY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY 
PRETTY EVERYBODY THAT'S STOOD 
AROUND HERE I WOULD TRUST WITH ME 
KEYS KEYS D. O. YOU THINK THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM 
OTHER NEIGHBOURHOODS 
I THINK IT IS 
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AND I THINK 
A LOT OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS 
DOWN TO THE COMMUNITY INITIATIVES 
AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE GOT THE 
ESTATE MANAGEMENT BOARD 
PEOPLE RUN EVERYTHING AROUND HERE 
THEMSELVES THAT'S RIGHT YEAH 
YEAH YEAH IT FORCES YOU TO GET TO KNOW ONE 
ANOTHER ANOTHER A LOT OF PEOPLE KNEW ONE ANOTHER IN 
THE BEGINNING WHICH IS HOW WE WERE 
ABLE TO DEVELOP AND SET EVERYTHING 
UP AND THAT MEANT THAT NEW PEOPLE 
COMING ALONG HAVE JOINED IN AND YOU 
KNOW THE WHOLE THING SNOWBALLED 
REALLY REALLY DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS THAT YOU 
KNOW YOUR NEIGHBOURS YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY I LIVED HERE A NUMBER 
OF YEARS AND I HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN ME 
NEIGHBOURS NEIGHBOURS IT USED TO BE NOT LIKE THIS NO NO WHAT WAS IT LIKE 
MM TO DESCRIBE 
IT LIKE BEIRUT I SHOULD IMAGINE 
AND IT HAS ALL CHANGE SND 
YES YES 
WE WORKED QUITE HARD TO GET IT THE 
WAY IT IS NOW 
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN NAME MOST 
PEOPLE AROUND HERE 
YEAH YEAH 
DEFINITELY DEFINITELY DO YOU THINK THAT MATTERS 
MM YEAH IT DOES REALLY 
I'M SURE IT DOES REALLY L. THINK 
YOU KNOW YOU GET TO KNOW YOUR 
NEIGHBOURS YOU PUT YOURSELF OUT TO 
GET TO KNOW THEM 
IT IS NOT THE WAY OF THINGS THESE 
DAYS MOST PEOPLE ONLY KNOW ONE OR 
TWO PEOPLE AROUND AND KEEP 
THEMSELVES TO THEMSELVES CAN YOU 
KEEP YOURSELF TO TO YOURSELF AROUND 
HERE 
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT I HERE THINK PEOPLE DO GET TO KNOW EACH 
OTHER BUT IT IS THE RELATIONSHIPS 
BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT UNDERPIN ALL 
THE THINGS THAT HAVE TAKEN OFF AND 
IT IS DUE TO THAT THAT THAT THE 
ESTATE HAS BEEN MAINTAINED IN GOOD 
CONDITION CONDITION IS IT A BIT NOSY CAN YOU NOT KEEP 
YOURSELF TO YOURSELF 
IT IS A BIT 
NOSY BUT IN A NICE WAY EVERYONE 
IS CONCERNED FOR THE COMMON GOOD 
AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT 
IS IT BECOMING FRIENDLIER OR LESS 
FRIENDLY AROUND HERE 
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN FRIENDLY BUT I 
THINK THERE IS DIFFERENT DEGREES OF 
FRIENDLINESS AND RECENTLY WE HAVE 
HAD SEVERAL NEW PEOPLE MOVE IN AND 
THEY SEEM TO BE SETTLING IN AND 
BECOMING PART 
DO YOU THEY FEEL 
EXCLUDED IF EVERYONE IS CLOSE IS 
IT HARD TO MOVE IN AND BE A PART OF 
IT 
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A NEW IT TENANT AT THE END OF THE TABLE SO 
YOU MAY WANT TO ASK HER 
I DON'T KNOW IF MY ARM STRETCHES 
THAT FAR YOU FEEL AS IF YOU ARE 
FITTING IN YES YES THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR 
THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR 
I WISH YOU VERY WELL AT PEMBROKE 
STREET STREET TOMORROW WE HAVE GOT FILM COMING 
FROM PETERBOROUGH JUST ASKING THE 
QUESTION DO YOU NOD AND SAY HELLO
