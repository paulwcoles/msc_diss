HI THERE I'M ALEXANDER ALEXANDER THE NOT SO GREAT 
OR AT LEAST THAT'S HOW I USED TO FEEL I'M SCOTTISH BUT ALSO GREEK 
MY GRANDDAD OR PAPOU WANTED ME TO BE PROUD OF BEING GREEK 
HE HAS THIS BOOK YOU SEE 
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER EVERY TIME I OPENED IT STRANGE THINGS HAPPENED 
DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD I AM YEAH 
YOU TELL ME ALL THE TIME TWENTY ONE 
A VERY OLD AND TIRED TWENTY ONE 
I'M SIXTY FOUR OH YOU'RE ANCIENT YOU'RE A PAPOUSAURUS 
TIME FOR ME TO RETIRE SO I'M SELLING THE RESTAURANT 
NO WHO TO I'VE HAD TWO OFFERS 
THERE'S THIS GREEK GUY MR. MINOS FROM THE SOUTH 
HE'S BOUGHT ALL THE RESTAURANTS IN TOWN ALMOST 
HE PAYS GOOD MONEY VERY PERSUASIVE FIGHTS UNTIL HE GETS WHAT HE WANTS 
WHAT'S THE OTHER OFFER NOT SO MUCH MONEY 
BUT IT'S RHONA'S HUSBAND FROM NEXT DOOR HELEN'S UNCLE 
BUT HE'S RELATED TO HELEN I THOUGHT YOU TWO WERE FRIENDS NOW 
BUT HE'S NOT GREEK HE'S ITALIAN 
HIS NAME'S GIOVANNI LUIGI BIAGGI 
IT'S FUNNY EH AFTER ALEXANDER THE GREAT GREECE CHANGED BIT BY BIT 
AND WAS TAKEN OVER BY ITALIANS 
JUST LIKE OUR SHOP 
OUR GREEK TAVERNA COULD BECOME BIAGGI'S PIZZA AND PASTA 
WELL THIS ALEXANDER THE GREAT 
IS NOT GONNA LET BIAGGI'S PIZZA AND PASTA TAKE U. S. OVER 
I WON'T LET YOU SELL IT TO THEM OR THE OTHER BLOKE I HAVE TO 
I HAVE TO ALEX I'M TIRED 
BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HELP ME HUH WHO SHOULD I SELL TO 
MAYBE THE ANCIENT GREEKS CAN SHOW US A GOOD WAY HOW TO DECIDE 
PAPOU I HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR A LECTURE 
EVERY TIME I LOOK IN THAT BOOK I ALWAYS MAKE A FOOL OF MYSELF 
I CAN'T AFFORD TO LOOK STUPID TODAY IT'S SPORTS DAY 
LAST YEAR I TRIPPED BEFORE I'D STARTED 
WHAT HAVE THE ANCIENT GREEKS GOT TO DO WITH MAKING DECISIONS 
WHAT HAVE THEY TO DO WITH ANYTHING 
WHAT HAVE THE ANCIENT GREEKS GOT TO DO WITH HOW WE MAKE DECISIONS 
EVERYTHING THEY THOUGHT UP GREAT WAYS TO MAKE DECISIONS 
LOOK IN THE BOOK FOR ME ALEX PLEASE

RUN LIKE THE WIND MY LITTLE ALEXANDER THE GREAT 
RUN LIKE THE WIND THE ROMANS ARE COMING 
WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO HOW COULD I HELP PAPOU MAKE A DECISION 
MAYBE THE BOOK WOULD HELP 
CITIZENSHIP 
OH HELLO WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU 
I HAVE TO MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW 
YOU LIVE IN ATHENS THE MOST POWERFUL STATE IN GREECE 
YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS WELL I DON'T 
IN ATHENS THE CITIZENS VOTE TO MAKE DECISIONS 
IT'S CALLED DEMOCRACY 
THE WORD DEMOCRACY COMES FROM ANCIENT GREECE 
DEMOS MEANS PEOPLE AND KRATOS MEANS RULE PEOPLE RULE 
H. M. M. 
OR THEY DID AS LONG AS THEY WERE RICH MALE 
NOT BORN OUTSIDE THE CITY AND OVER TWENTY 
BUT IT DIDN'T STAY LIKE THAT 
A MAN CALLED CLEISTHENES SET UP AN ASSEMBLY IN ATHENS 
WHERE EVERY CITIZEN COULD SPEAK AND VOTE 
UNLIKE NOW IF PEOPLE DIDN'T TURN UP THE POLICE ROUNDED THEM UP 
O. I. YOU GET UP THE HILL AND VOTE 
SO I SHOULD GATHER UP SIX THOUSAND RICH OLD MEN LIKE THE GREEKS DID 
AND GET THEM TO YELL AT EACH OTHER ON A HILL 
TO DECIDE WHO WE SHOULD SELL OUR RESTAURANT TO 
WELL NO THANKS FOR YOUR HELP 
AT THAT POINT I JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT THE SLAVE MEANT 
DECISIONS DECISIONS 
THIS IS THE STORY OF SOME WOMEN WHO WERE TIRED OF WAR 
AND THEIR DECISIONS TO END IT SEE IF YOU CAN REMEMBER 
WHEN THE SOLDIERS SAY THE LADIES WILL COME OUT OF THE TEMPLE 
WHERE'S MY SWORD MEN ALWAYS FIGHTING WHERE'S ME HELMET 
EITHER THEY'RE JUST HOME FROM WAR OR THEY'RE LEAVING FOR THE NEXT 
PART TIME HUSBANDS WE'VE GOT 
PART HUSBAND'S WHAT I'VE GOT
