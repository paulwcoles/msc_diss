THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE 
THIS IS NOT A GAME 
THIS IS A JOB INTERVIEW FROM HELL 
THAT JOB INTERVIEW HAS ATTRACTED BRITAIN'S MOST AMBITIOUS BUSINESS TALENT 
AS EACH YEAR THEY COME FACE TO FACE WITH THE CAPITAL'S TOUGHEST TASKMASTER SIR ALAN SUGAR 
ONE OF YOU IS GOING TO GET A JOB WORKING FOR ME 
OVER TWELVE WEEKS SIR ALAN TESTS EVERY BUSINESS SKILL 
THIS TASK IS ALL ABOUT ADVERTISING 
EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THEIR TEAM HAS TO BE THE BEST WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SOME MONEY WE REALLY ARE 
LET'S GO GO GO I'M GOING TO WIN THIS NOW IF IT KILLS ME 
AS THE PRESSURE MOUNTS THE BEST LAID PLANS GO WRONG 
I'M GETTING PISSED OFF WITH IT 
I AM YOUR BOSS 
I'M DOING THIS YOU IDIOT FOR YOU 
AND SOME TERRIBLE DECISIONS GET MADE 
WE NEED ONE HUNDRED CHICKENS 
A FRYING PAN ON TOP TO COOK THE SAUSAGES PERFECT 
TONIGHT WE LOOK BACK OVER THREE YEARS OF THE APPRENTICE 
YOU'RE FIRED 
AND AT SOME OF THE WORST DECISIONS EVER 
MORNING MORNING SIR ALAN 
THE TASKS THEMSELVES ARE QUITE BASIC BUSINESS PRINCIPLES 
SO THAT SIDE OF IT'S EASY 
THE DIFFICULTY LIES IN THE TIME CONSTRAINTS THAT YOU'RE UNDER 
AND YOU'VE GOT A TEAM WHO IN THE REAL WORLD WOULD BE WORKING WITH YOU 
UNFORTUNATELY I FOUND PEOPLE ARE WORKING AGAINST US 
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE IN A TEAM YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN 
THE TEAM THAT COMES IN WITH THE MOST COMMISSION IS GOING TO WIN 
THE TEAM THAT DOESN'T ONE OF YOU WILL GET FIRED 
IT'S A HIGH STRESS ENVIRONMENT AND NOT LEAST BECAUSE 
WHAT YOU DO IS GOING TO BE RECORDED AND SHOWN TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE MESSED UP 
ONE KEY TO BUSINESS SUCCESS AND WINNING ANY APPRENTICE TASK IS LEADERSHIP 
SOMETHING DISCOVERED TOO LATE WHEN THE POWER OF BECOMING PROJECT MANAGER 
WENT TO THE HEAD OF TWICE BANKRUPT RORY LAING 
PROJECT MANAGER I AM YOUR BOSS 
DESIGNING A NEW PRODUCT FOR THE MULTI MILLION POUND BRITISH DOG MARKET 
TURNED TEAM LEADER RORY INTO THE MANAGER FROM HELL 
WORKING FOR RORY AHH 
RORY HAD AN APPALLING MANAGEMENT STYLE 
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE COCK AS A LEADER 
DISCIPLINE GUYS IS SOMETHING I GO FUCKING CRAZY FOR 
I HATE TO TELL YOU BUT I SAW A BIT OF RORY IN MYSELF 
YOU ARE OVER TALKING AND SAYING JUST THIS CAN I JUST THAT 
I WILL SEND YOU OUT 
I DID HAVE A WHINGE OF EMBARRASSMENT AS I WATCHED RORY 
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN I WANTED TO SAY EXACTLY THE SAME 
COULD YOU SHUT UP COULD YOU PLEASE SAY THIS IN THIS WAY 
CAN YOU PLEASE TRY AND STOP SWEARING 
O. K. IT'S JUST HORRIBLE TO LISTEN TO 
RORY TRIED TO TAKE A STRONG FIRM GRIP WITH THE TEAM AND SHAKE IT OUT 
AND SAY LOOK WE DO IT MY WAY OR NO WAY AT ALL 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE THE AUTOCRATIC BEHAVIOUR CAME FROM 
I THINK IT WAS JUST THE CHARACTERS THAT WERE IN THE GROUP 
WE NEEDED DISCIPLINE 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BRAINSTORMING AND THAT KIND OF STUFF 
TAKE YOUR JACKETS OFF PLEASE O. K. TAKE YOUR JACKETS OFF 
TAKE OUR JACKETS OFF JACKETS OFF 
WHEN HE TOLD US TO TAKE OUR JACKETS OFF I NEARLY TOLD THEM TO FUCK OFF TO BE HONEST 
THERE HE WAS THINKING IN REALLY SCHOOL PREFECT TERMS 
OF HOW YOU ESTABLISH AUTHORITY 
YOU ALL TAKE YOUR SHIRTS OFF AND I'LL KEEP MY JACKET ON 
THAT WILL TELL YOU THAT I'M IN CHARGE SOD THAT 
IT DOESN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT YOU'RE A BIT OF A PRAT 
IF YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT GETTING INTO TROUBLE CAN YOU TAKE OFF YOUR TIES AS WELL 
PEOPLE NEED TO EARN THEIR RIGHT TO BE THE BOSS PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW 
WHO THE BOSS IS BY THE WAY THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES AND DO THINGS 
NOT THAT THEY'RE WEARING A JACKET 
TAKE IT DOWN HAPPY WITH THAT NEXT ONE NEXT ONE 
MOVING ON SHH NEXT ONE 
DETERMINED TO STAMP HIS CONTROL ON THE TEAM 
RORY FORCED THROUGH HIS OWN IDEA A UTILITY BELT FOR DOG WALKERS 
HE CALLED IT THE POOCH POUCH 
RIGHT GRAB YOUR DOG PUT THE STRAP OVER YOU GRAB THE BELT GOES OVER YOURSELF 
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED THE POO POUCH WHAT AN ABSOLUTE LOAD OF CRAP 
SUCH AN ITEM HAS NOT BEEN INVENTED BECAUSE NOBODY NEEDS IT 
GOT A BOTTLE ON THERE A PLACE FOR A BALL BISCUITS POUCH ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF 
WHEN YOU TAKE A DOG FOR A WALK YOU PUT THE LEAD IN YOUR POCKET 
YOU PUT YOUR PLASTIC BAG FOR POOPER SCOOPING IN YOUR POCKET 
YOU DON'T NEED A DOG WALKERS' BELT OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INVENTED ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL THAT THE UTILITY STRAP WAS BAD UNTIL IT WAS ON 
AM I GOING TO PULL IN THIS 
MAYBE MAYBE 
THE RAMBO BELT WAS JUST AWFUL 
IT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING A GUERRILLA WOULD WEAR 
I'M NOT SURE THAT IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE 
IT'S GOOD TO LOOK LIKE A TERRORIST WHEN YOU'RE WALKING YOUR DOG 
WHEN HIS POOCH POUCH GOT TO THE BOARDROOM ORIGINALITY WAS ALL RORY COULD CLAIM 
IT DOES FULFIL THE TASK OF BEING INNOVATIVE 
IT'S GOT SOME ORIGINALITY YEAH 
YOU'VE GOT TO FIND AN ORIGINAL NUTTER TO GO AND WEAR IT 
BUT IT WAS THE CHALLENGE TO HIS LEADERSHIP STYLE THAT WAS TO BE RORY'S UNDOING 
I HAVE HAD ROADWORKS NEXT TO ME FOR THE WHOLE OF THIS PROJECT 
IT WAS APPARENT ON THAT TASK 
THAT THERE WAS A BIG PERSONALITY CLASH BETWEEN RORY AND TRE 
DO YOU WANT TO GO OUTSIDE AND LEAVE THEM A NICE MESSAGE 
WE DON'T LEAVE SWEARING NASTY MESSAGES ON ANSWERPHONES 
I SAID LEAVE A NICE MESSAGE 
NO NO WE'LL JUST LET THEM COME BACK WHEN THEY'RE READY CAN I LEAVE THEM A MESSAGE NO 
RORY LOST MY RESPECT VERY EARLY ON WITH THE WAY HE SPOKE TO PEOPLE 
IT CONSULTANT TRE AZAM WOULDN'T TAKE ORDERS FROM ANYONE 
WHEN TRE SNIFFS A WEAKNESS HE'LL GO AFTER YOU AND TAKE YOU DOWN 
IF YOU FUCKING DO AS YOU'RE FUCKING TOLD 
DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE I'M A FUCKING FIVE YEAR OLD 
YOU'RE A COMPLETE MORON FUCKING NUTS 
I'D NEVER REALLY MET SOMEONE LIKE TRE 
SOMEONE WHO WAS SO FINELY TUNED TO WIND ME UP 
MATE YOU'RE KILLING ME PLEASE NONE OF THIS BACKCHAT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE ELSE ENOUGH O. K. 
WHAT ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF YOUR TEAM NOT BEING HERE WHAT ABOUT THEIR BACKCHAT 
YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL THEM I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU FIX THIS PROBLEM 
THE ONLY REASON YOU ARE HERE IS BECAUSE YOUR BACKCHAT IS GETTING SO BAD IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
ENOUGH RIGHT STOP TALKING TO ME I'M GOING TO STOP TALKING TO YOU DON'T WIND ME UP 
THAT SCENE WITH RORY WHEN RORY SAYS I AM YOUR BOSS 
QUALITY SCENE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SCENES EVER IN THE APPRENTICE 
I'D JUST LIKE YOU TO DO AS YOU'RE TOLD 
THIS BIZARRE MOMENT WHEN HE SORT OF MOUNTED HIS PODIUM 
AND LIKE A SHAKESPEAREAN HERO IN THE MODE OF JULIUS CAESAR 
ANNOUNCED I AM YOUR BOSS 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO ME TALK TO ME ON A LEVEL 
PLEASE CAN YOU GO OVER THERE TALK TO ME AS A COLLEAGUE NOT A CHILD 
DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE MY BOSS WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER 
I AM YOUR BOSS NO YOU'RE MY PROJECT MANAGER I AM YOUR BOSS 
I AM YOUR BOSS 
I AM YOUR BOSS 
THE LOUDER HE ASSERTED IT AND THE MORE RHETORICALLY HE SAID I AM YOUR BOSS 
THE MORE THE VIEWING PUBLIC SAT ON SOFAS ALL OVER THE UNITED KINGDOM 
AND SHOUTED BACK OH NO YOU'RE NOT 
YOU'RE NOTHING TO ME AT THIS MOMENT PLEASE GO OVER THERE 
A FRIEND AT HOME WANTS A T. SHIRT FOR ME THAT SAYS I AM YOUR BOSS 
AND ON THE BACK YOU'RE NOTHING TO ME 
BUT IT WAS NEEDED AT THE TIME AND IT FLOWED 
AND OH 
HE IS GOING TO MAKE MINCEMEAT OUT OF YOU SUNSHINE IF YOU DO NOT START SPEAKING UP FOR YOURSELF O. K. 
ONE THING HE CAN DO IS BUNNY AND YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE GOT YOUR TONGUE STUCK IN THE TOP OF YOUR MOUTH 
TRE YOU COULD SEE HIM JUST TWITCHING 
I'M GOING TO LET HIM HAVE IT I'M BOILING 
I'M GOING TO LET HIM HAVE IT 
TRE YEP MAKE MINCEMEAT OUT OF HIM BAM 
YOU'RE INCOMPETENT TO WORK WITH SOMEBODY LIKE ME 
YOU'RE UP THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'VE ACHIEVED HE'S NOT 
AS A SPECIALIST IN MY AREA I TRIED TO ADVISE AS BEST AS I COULD 
HE WASN'T WILLING TO LISTEN ARE YOU LISTENING TO ALL THIS YES SIR ALAN 
YOU CAN COME BACK ANY TIME YOU WANT 
LISTEN I'VE GOT A REMOTE CONTROL IN MY HAND HERE NOW AN IMAGINARY REMOTE CONTROL YOU'RE ON PAUSE 
NOW PLAY OFF YOU GO 
HE IS CONTINUALLY BUTTING IN SIR ALAN HE'S NOT A TEAM PLAYER 
APPARENTLY I TOOK UP EIGHTY PER CENT OF HIS TIME YOU'RE ON PAUSE AT THE MOMENT 
THERE'S COMPETITION WHERE ONE PERSON'S GOING TO WIN 
IF YOU CAN FIND A WEAKNESS IN SOMEBODY ELSE AND YOU CAN EXPOSE THAT WEAKNESS IT'S AN ADVANTAGE 
AND WHEN YOU TAKE ME ON IN A CHALLENGE YOU'RE SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR DEFEAT 
YOU'RE A DISASTER I'M SORRY 
A TOTAL ABSOLUTE DISASTER 
I'VE GIVEN YOU THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING TO SORT YOURSELF OUT HERE AND YOU HAVEN'T 
YOU'RE FIRED 
I THINK HE WAS CONTROLLING IN THE WORST WAY 
AND I THINK HIS HORRIBLE INVENTION OF THAT NASTY BELT 
WITH A BIT OF TOILET PAPER ATTACHED PRETTY MUCH SUMMED UP HIS TALENT NOTHING 
IF TOO MUCH CONTROL CAN BE FATAL 
FAILURE TO SHOW LEADERSHIP CAN BE JUST AS DEADLY 
AS DISCOVERED IN THE FIRST SERIES BY PAUL TORRISI 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SHOOTING FROM HERE 
ASKED TO CREATE AN AD CAMPAIGN FOR A NEW C. D. PLAYER PROJECT MANAGER PAUL 
PREFERRED DIRECTING THE CAMERAS TO LEADING HIS TEAM 
FIRE AWAY HI MUM HI SON 
THE WHOLE TASK FELL DOWN BECAUSE OF PAUL'S LEADERSHIP QUALITIES' 
HE WAS DISORGANISED AND HE ONLY FOCUSED ON HIS ADVERT 
I JUST WANT TO GET A FEEL FOR THE MOOD THE SCENE TO SEE IF IT NEEDS SPICING 
AND YOU KNOW THE SORT OF INTERACTION BETWEEN MUM AND SON 
IT WAS HIS DIRECTORAL DEBUT WASN'T IT 
HE WAS REALLY GETTING INTO IT HE NEEDED A DIRECTOR'S CHAIR 
HE THOUGHT AFTER ABOUT TEN MINUTES ON THE SET 
THAT HE WAS FRANCO ZEFFIRELLI AND BECAME TOTALLY IMMERSED IN THIS 
THERE'S A SLIGHT PAUSE AND THEN IT'S A GIGGLE 
NOT FUNNY ENOUGH 
TELL HIM A FRIGGING JOKE MAN AARDVARK WALKS INTO THE PUB AND THE BARMAN SAYS WHY THE LONG FACE 
I DON'T KNOW NO THAT'S THE JOKE AN AARDVARK HAS A LONG FACE 
OH 
YES I DID GET A TINY BIT CARRIED AWAY 
WITH BEING THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADVERT BUT I ENJOYED MYSELF WHY NOT 
PAUL'S MOVIE PREMIERE CAME IN THE BOARDROOM I'M ALL EARS 
CAN WE RUN THE COMMERCIAL NOW PLEASE 
IF YOU WISH 
I REMEMBER SEEING THE FINAL CUT AND JUST GOING 
OH MY GOODNESS THIS IS DIRE 
HI MUM 
HI SON THAT'S MINE YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN UPSTAIRS GO 
IT WAS POSSIBLY POSSIBLY THE WORST ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN OF ALL TIME WASN'T IT 
IT JUST MADE ME LAUGH BECAUSE IT WAS SO APPALLINGLY BAD 
MY T. V. ADVERT WAS A BLOODY CRACKER 
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT MUM'S LOUNGING ABOUT DRINKING AND THIS THAT AND THE OTHER 
WHERE'S THE PRODUCT NOT THERE THEN THE GUY IN THE CORNER PLAYING AROUND WITH MUSIC 
WHERE'S THE PRODUCT NOT THERE IT IS THERE SIR ALAN 
IF YOU GOT A MICROSCOPE AND YOU PUT YOUR HEAD IN FRONT OF THE T. V. 
NOT ENOUGH OF THE PRODUCT IN THAT ADVERT 
YOU'RE TOO CLOSE TO IT I'M AFRAID MUCH TOO CLOSE 
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT IT THROUGH THE EYES OF THE CONSUMER 
LUCKILY FOR PAUL SOMETHING WORSE THAN HIS T. V. AD SAT ON SIR ALAN'S DESK 
THIS IS PATHETIC 
WHO WAS SITTING WITH THE MAC MAN WHEN THIS WAS GOING ON 
I. THAT WAS MY TASK TO DO THAT 
SAIRA AND THE POSTER WAS SHOCKING 
WE'LL TAKE THAT IMAGE O. K. WE KEEP THAT ONE 
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THE CONSENSUS OF THE REST OF THE TEAM 
I HAVEN'T GOT TIME THE TEAM AREN'T HERE LET'S GET TO WORK ON IT I THINK SO 
I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU TO IT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THE ADVERT 
YEAH YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING 
THE HEADLINES SUB HEADINGS EVERYTHING WE WILL NOT DISTURB YOU 
SHE GAVE VERY CURSORY SORT OF BRIEF TO MAC MAN AS SIR ALAN CALLED HIM 
AND THEN DISAPPEARED OFF AND STARTED REARRANGING THE FURNITURE 
MOVING CHAIRS AROUND OH MY GOD WHAT PLANET WAS SHE ON 
THIS IS FANTASTIC 
SHE WAS OFF REARRANGING CHAIRS AND GETTING THE MOOD RIGHT THE ATMOSPHERE RIGHT 
AND POOR MAC MAN WAS UPSTAIRS WAITING FOR A PROPER BRIEF WHICH HE NEVER REALLY GOT 
SO I THEN SAW THE POSTER 
AND IT WAS AT THAT POINT ONE THOUGHT OH SHIT 
AT THAT POINT ONE THOUGHT I AM FOR THE CHOP 
I HAD DROPPED A BOLLOCK IN A BIG WAY IT WAS JUST SO TERRIBLY BAD 
IT WAS CHEAP IT WAS TACKY 
IT WAS LIKE NINETEEN SIXTY AD 
THAT WAS SOMETHING YOU'D EXPECT A PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILD TO DO 
IT WAS SO POOR IT WAS EMBARRASSING 
WE HAVEN'T GOT THE FUCKING NINETY NINE ON THERE 
THAT WAS THE WORST THING 
I'D EVER DONE AND SINCE I'VE EVER DONE 
WHAT REALLY INFURIATED ME WAS THAT SAIRA 
WHO'D BEEN IN CHARGE OF THIS WHOLE HORROR THEN SAID TO PAUL 
YOU KNOW PAUL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN ANY PRIZES FOR THIS 
AS THOUGH SHE HAD HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT 
I'M NOT BEING HORRIBLE BUT THAT IS SHIT 
THAT JUST SHOWS LIKE IT'S BEEN PLONKED THERE 
SAIRA THERE'S NO POINT IN SAYING THAT NOW 
IT'S GONE TWO O'CLOCK WE HAVE TO GET INTO IT AND FOCUS 
DON'T YOU WORRY I'M A PROFESSIONAL I CAN GET INTO IT I'M AN ACTRESS 
BUT I'M TELLING YOU NOW THAT'S NOT GOING TO WIN YOU A PRIZE 
THAT WILL NOT WIN YOU A PRIZE 
OH MY GOD DID SHE NOT KNOW THAT SHE WAS THE ONE WHO DID IT 
SHE WAS THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT 
IT WAS JUST A DISASTER AND I REMEMBER RIPPING IT UP 
WHEN WE TOOK IT TO THE BOARDROOM IT HAD ALL BEEN PATCHED TOGETHER 
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN STUCK TO THAT MAC MAN LIKE SHIT TO A BLANKET 
THIS IS THE THING THAT WOULD HAVE IMPRESSED THEM IN THE END 
NONE OF THE OTHER BULLSHIT WOULD HAVE IMPRESSED THEM 
PAUL THAT'S THE FATAL ERROR IN YOUR CAMPAIGN 
WITH PAUL'S LACK OF LEADERSHIP UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT 
RACHEL GROVES STEPPED ONTO THE STAGE 
HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU COME INTO THIS ROOM WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS ROOM 
THE PITCH WAS I THINK ONE OF THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCES I'VE EVER HAD TO ENDURE 
DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE RELAXED 
EXCITED EXCITED I'M LIKING THE SOUND OF EXCITED 
I GAVE HER YOU KNOW CARTE BLANCHE I SAID DO WHAT YOU WANT RACHEL I THOUGHT WE WERE DYING ANYWAY 
I AM DROWNING ANYWAY WHAT DOES IT MATTER DO WHAT YOU WANT AND UNFORTUNATELY SHE DID 
HOW ARE WE FEELING NOW 
WELL I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE KIND OF MOMENTS 
IT WAS THE ONLY TIME IN THE SERIES SO FAR 
WHEN I'VE ACTUALLY WISHED THAT THE GROUND WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW ME UP IT WAS AWFUL BEING IN THAT ROOM 
I FOUND MYSELF LOOKING THROUGH MY EYES LIKE THIS 
I WANT TO HIDE BEHIND THE SOFA 
STOP IT NOW STOP IT NOW DON'T YOU REALISE WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
SHE JUST SORT OF WENT A BIT LIKE THIS 
THEN THERE WAS A SPIN 
WHEN SHE STARTED TAKING HER SHOES OFF AND MOVING INTO 
A SORT OF SLOW RUMBA THEN WE REALLY KNEW WE WERE IN TROUBLE 
WHEN YOU SAW THE FACES AROUND THE ROOM YOU REALISED EVERYBODY WAS JUST COMPLETELY TAKEN ABACK 
IT WAS LIKE A COLD STEEL HAND ROUND ONE'S SPHINCTER 
AS ONE WATCHED RACHEL PERFORM HER DANCE IT WAS HORRIBLE 
THERE I AM LOOKING PROJECT LEADER 
AND PEOPLE TURNED TO ME AS IF TO SAY YOU HAVE SANCTIONED THIS 
THAT IDIOT STOOD THERE WITH HER SHOES OFF DANCING LIKE A HIPPY YOU HAVE SANCTIONED THIS 
KIND OF CHEERFUL YOU KNOW MUSIC CAN DO AN INCREDIBLE THING 
HOW DOES THAT MUSIC MAKE YOU FEEL 
LIKE I'M SITTING WATCHING A NINETEEN SEVENTIES SITCOM THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
IT MAKES YOU FEEL UPBEAT AND HAPPY 
RACHEL WAS RUBBISH ON THAT TASK FOR THE SIMPLE REASON 
THAT SHE WAS AN EXPERIENCED ADVERTISER AND MARKETER 
THAT WAS HER GIG THAT'S WHAT SHE DID 
SHE CAME TO ME GIVING ME ALL THIS I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING PAUL I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING 
AND SHE COST US THE TASK 
HER PERFORMANCE ON THE TASK SUGGESTED YOU KNOW SHE HAD TO BE HANGED AND SHE WAS 
WHEN IT COMES TO BULLSHIT THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT YOU HAVEN'T EVEN LEARNT YET ABOUT ALL THIS CRAP 
YOU WASTED YOUR TIME AND BECAUSE YOU WASTED YOUR TIME 
AND BECAUSE YOU SAY AND CLAIM TO BE AN EXPERT IN ADVERTISING ON YOUR OWN C. V. 
IT BRINGS ME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT RACHEL I'M SORRY YOU'RE FIRED 
RACHEL DESERVED TO BE FIRED FOR BEING RACHEL 
IT'S A CLASSIC APPRENTICE MOMENT WHERE THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BEST AT 
AND IF THAT'S THE BEST YOU CAN DO YOU'VE GOT NO HOPE IN THE COMPETITION AT ALL 
RACHEL'S POOR PRESENTATION COST HER THE JOB 
AND OVER THE YEARS SIR ALAN HAS TESTED THIS KEY BUSINESS DECISION 
WHO SHOULD PITCH A TEAM'S PRODUCT 
HELLO EVERYONE I'M GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT I WAS WORRIED A FEW MIGHT DROP OUT 
PITCH WELL AND YOU CLOSE A DEAL DO IT BADLY AND THE DEAL IS LOST 
WE ARE FROM STEALTH AND WE BRING GREAT INNOVATION TO THE MARKET PLACE 
DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC BECAUSE WE BELIEVE NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE 
WHEN BOTH TEAMS HAD TO PRODUCE A CHARITY CALENDAR FOR THE GREAT ORMOND STREET HOSPITAL 
SIR ALAN GOT A MASTERCLASS IN HOW NOT TO DO IT 
MY NAME'S NARGIS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN YOU CAN HELP 
ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS WHAT SORT OF RETAIL PRICE I HAVEN'T FINISHED SPEAKING SORRY 
ONE OF THE WORST PRESENTATIONS I'VE EVER SEEN 
AGAIN IT'S THE TROUBLE WITH SO MANY CANDIDATES IN THE APPRENTICE 
THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW BAD THEY ARE 
THE GIRLS LED BY PROJECT MANAGER NARGIS AGA CREATED A CAT CALENDAR 
THE BOYS WENT FOR BABIES 
BOTH TEAMS HAD TO PITCH THEIR CHARITY CALENDARS TO THREE OF THE COUNTRY'S LEADING RETAILERS 
DAVID WE'RE HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT GREAT ORMOND STREET HOSPITAL 
THE BOYS PINNED THEIR HOPES ON MANI SANDER 
IT WAS A VERY SHORT AND SUCCINCT PITCH WHICH IS HOW I PRESENT 
BECAUSE I PRESENT TO SENIOR PEOPLE AND THEY LIKE IT THAT WAY 
THE WHOLE HOUSE EVERYBODY WAS TAKING THE PISS OUT OF HIM 
THIS IS WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING AND I WILL GO IN THERE AND I WILL SELL SELL SELL 
GUYS GUYS I'M A WORLD CLASS PRESENTER 
WHEN HE PRESENTED HE WAS ABSOLUTELY APPALLING 
I THINK AND FORGIVE ME IF I BECOME EMOTIONAL BECAUSE I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS CAUSE 
TO BE THERE IN THAT ROOM WHEN HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT 
HE JUST FRILLED IT UP I CAN'T REMEMBER 
THE EXACT WORDS HE USED BUT I REMEMBER THINKING HE'S GETTING FIRED FOR THIS 
MANI'S PRESENTATION SKILLS WERE JUST AWFUL 
REALLY REALLY BAD 
AT THE TIME YOU JUST THINK THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING HE CAN'T BE THAT BAD AND HE WAS 
I THINK IT'S A TRUTH THAT'S SELF EVIDENT THAT EVERY CHILD 
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO A FULL HEALTHY JOYOUS LIFE 
AND THIS OUTFIT GIVES THESE CHILDREN THAT CHOICE 
I'M GOING TO GO AND TRY IN THE MOST PATRONISING VOICE THAT I CAN AND TOUCH YOUR HEART STRINGS 
WHEN THEY'RE THINKING WHAT ARE MY MARGINS 
HE WAS APPALLING HE WASN'T QUITE AS BAD AS RACHEL WITH THE BARE FEET BUT ALMOST 
YOU DON'T GO IN TO SELL A CALENDAR 
BY BECOMING TEARFUL ABOUT THE CHARITY THAT THE CALENDAR IS PROMOTING 
THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF SAYING TO MANI AS WE DID AS A GROUP 
LISTEN THAT WASN'T GREAT BUT WE CAN IMPROVE 
IF WE GO IN WITH THE SAME PRESENTATION AGAIN WE'RE BURIED 
LET'S JUST MAKE SURE MANI DOESN'T DO IT THAT BAD AGAIN BUT HE DID 
I LOVE THAT PICTURE IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL 
BOWLED OVER 
LOST IN CRICKET CRYING 
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES AS A LIVING HE NEEDS TO GO ON A TRAINING COURSE 
IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY NICELY PRODUCED IF I'M BEING HONEST 
PLEASE BE HONEST IT HAS A LOOK OF DESKTOP PUBLISHING ABOUT IT 
DOES IT I DON'T THINK WE'D BE ABLE TO PAY ANYTHING MORE THAN TWO POINT SEVEN OH OR TWO POINT SEVEN FIVE FOR THIS 
IT WAS EMBARRASSING IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO SIT THROUGH IT 
THE GUYS IN THE TEAM WEREN'T VERY HAPPY 
AND THEN I SAW WHAT NARGIS DID ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I THOUGHT O. K. 
NARGIS STRODE INTO THE PITCH 
AND DELIVERED WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE 
AS BEING THE MOST HORRIBLE TWO OR THREE MINUTES OF PITCH I'VE EVER SEEN 
GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S NARGIS 
WHEN I SAW NARGIS PRESENT I WANTED TO CRAWL UP MY OWN BACKSIDE 
DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE SIX MILLION CAT OWNERS IN THE U. K. ALONE 
AND A MAJORITY MOST OF THOSE ACTUALLY LIVE IN LONDON 
ACTUALLY I DID KNOW THAT 
NARGIS WANTED TO DO THE PITCH SO NARGIS DID THE PITCH 
AND WE WAS CATEGORICALLY TOLD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DO WE INTERVENE 
SO UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DID WE INTERVENE 
A CLOSER LOOK AT THE PRODUCT 
ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS 
WHAT SORT OF RETAIL PRICE DO YOU 
I HAVEN'T FINISHED SPEAKING SORRY ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE 
AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW MANY YOU WANT 
YOU DON'T SPEAK TO A BUYER LIKE THAT 
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THEM BUY FROM YOU 
ALL OF US WERE SITTING THERE LIKE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AND THINKING WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON HERE 
I DIDN'T REALISE THE GUY WAS LOOKING FOR A CHAT 
AND I WASN'T TOLD BY MY TEAM MEMBERS LOOK HE JUST WANTS TO CHAT 
WE CAN CHANGE THE FORMAT OF THIS 
OR WHATEVER SO I JUST CARRIED ON 
WHAT SORT OF COST PRICE DO YOU IMAGINE 
ER 
SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION 
WHAT SORT OF COST PRICE TO US DO YOU IMAGINE 
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE A SUGGESTION TO ME HERE AND NOW 
I DON'T THINK EITHER OF US ARE PREPARED TO DO THAT 
IT'S NOT A GUESSING GAME IT'S NOT YOU GUESS A PRICE YOU GUESS A PRICE 
SHE BARKED BACK ALMOST NO YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU'D BE PREPARED TO PAY FOR THESE 
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO START AT 
WHAT IS YOUR PRICING STRUCTURE 
YOU TELL ME I'M GOING TO LOOK AT YOU AND I'M GOING TO TALK LIKE THAT I MEAN WHAT 
GIVE ME A FIGURE GIVE ME A NUMBER 
AFTERWARDS I DID ASK FOR FEEDBACK AND EVERYBODY SAID YOU DID AN EXCELLENT JOB THAT WAS FANTASTIC 
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO CARRY ON LIKE THAT 
THEN YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHETHER THEY ARE DOING THE KIND OF DOUBLE THINK THING 
LET HER HANG HERSELF LET HER BE SO BAD 
SHALL I SIT DOWN OR STAND UP 
I CAN'T SEE YOU IF YOU'RE SITTING DOWN STAND UP ALL RIGHT 
IT'S A COMPETITION 
YOU'RE IN THE FINAL OF THE ONE HUNDRED METRES AND YOU SEE SOMEBODY FALL 
DO YOU PICK THEM UP 
SOMETIMES YOU DO SOMETIMES YOU DON'T IT DEPENDS WHETHER YOU WANT TO CARRY ON RUNNING WITH THEM 
DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE SIX MILLION CAT OWNERS IN THE U. K. ALONE 
IT MAKES ME CRINGE JUST THINKING ABOUT IT 
THE PRODUCT IS FRESH STYLISH CONTEMPORARY 
IT WILL LOOK FANTASTIC ON YOUR SHELVES 
O. K. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS MAY I 
I HAVEN'T FINISHED THERE'S MORE O. K. 
ER 
NOW YOU CAN ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW MANY YOU WANT TO BUY 
YOU DID THE PRESENTING I DID YES 
AND YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY AT ALL YOU DON'T THINK 
I THINK I NEGOTIATED WELL I THINK I DID FINE 
GARY BECK SAYS YOU KEPT INTERRUPTING HIM 
WHO WAS I DON'T KNOW THE NAMES 
FROM CALENDAR CLUB 
YES YOU JUST DIDN'T REALLY LISTEN TOO MUCH 
YOU RATHER TOLD HIM RATHER THAN DISCUSSED WITH HIM 
RIGHT I THOUGHT IT WAS POOR O. K. 
I CAN LEARN FROM THAT 
I ACCEPT THAT I CAN LEARN FROM IT 
THE PRESENTATION TO THE RETAILERS WAS FLAWED AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED 
AND ON ON THE BASIS OF THAT NARGIS YOU'RE FIRED 
CHOOSING THE WRONG PRODUCT IS A DECISION THAT WILL KILL ANY CHANCE OF BECOMING THE APPRENTICE 
I AS PROJECT MANAGER WANT TO TAKE A RISK 
I'M GOING TO TAKE A RISK ON SECRET SIGNALS 
LINDSAY BOGAARD A CONFIDENT CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS MANAGER LOOKED A FORMIDABLE LEADER 
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT PERSONAL OPINIONS BUT PLEASE CAST THOSE ASIDE 
TIME'S GETTING ON WE WANT IT STOPPED 
WE'RE A BIT BUSY AT THE MOMENT 
SHE WAS SO TOGETHER AND I THOUGHT WOW THIS GIRL IS 
YOU KNOW SHE'S GOING SOMEWHERE 
I THOUGHT PERHAPS THIS ONE MIGHT GO QUITE A LONG WAY 
BUT THAT WAS SOON SHATTERED OF COURSE BY HER APPALLING DECISIONS IN THE TOY PROJECT 
SIR ALAN WANTED A NEW TOY FOR THE U. K. MARKET 
AND LINDSAY CHOSE A TOY THAT WOULD SIGNAL HER DOWNFALL 
WHAT DID PEOPLE USED TO DO TO TEXT MESSAGE THEY USED TO HAVE FLAGS SEMAPHORE FLAGS AND SEMAPHORE 
SIGN FLAGS WHAT ON EARTH WAS THAT 
SIGN LANGUAGE BASICALLY OF SOME SORT 
IN AN AGE WHEN EVEN LITTLE KIDS KNOW ABOUT TEXT MESSAGES 
SO IF YOU'RE IN A PLAYGROUND AND YOU WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO A FRIEND 
YOU CAN JUST HOLD IT UP AND PEOPLE WILL BE WONDERING WHAT THAT IS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS 
IT WAS A LOUSY IDEA RIGHT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CRAP NOT TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
IF I TOOK TWO TIN CANS AND PUT A BIT OF A STRING IN THE MIDDLE 
CALLED THAT A TELEPHONE WOULD THAT BE A GOOD IDEA THAT'S HOW BASIC IT WAS 
BUT LINDSAY WOULDN'T LISTEN 
I REALLY BECAME RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY TRANSFIXED BY THIS TOY 
I HAD THIS IDEA IT COULD GO GLOBAL YOU KNOW 
YOU COULD GET DEAF KIDS USING IT 
WHAT WE THOUGHT OF WAS LIKE THE WHOLE ROBOT WARS CONCEPT 
SO YOU COULD GET A ROBOT BUILDING KIT 
THIS WOULD GO WITH THE MECCANO IDEA OF CONSTRUCTING IT TOGETHER 
AND WHEN YOU'VE PUT IT TOGETHER YOU GET THESE TWO ROBOTS TO BATTLE 
THE ROBOT WAS SO MUCH BETTER 
A MODERN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SORT OF TOY 
JUST TO GIVE YOU MY INITIAL GUT FEEL FOR ME I REALLY LIKED THE ROBOT IDEA 
I THINK I PROBABLY GO WITH SAIRA WOULD BE THE ROBOTS 
MY FAVOURITE IS THE ROBOT IDEA FOR ME AT THE TIME 
THE ROBOT JUST SEEMED LIKE A PLASTIC TOY LOOKING LIKE A ROBOT 
BUT SECRET SIGNALS SEEMED LIKE A TOY THAT HAD A LOT OF POTENTIAL 
EVEN THOUGH SECRET SIGNALS WAS OUTVOTED 
SHE THEN DECIDED TO PUSH HER IDEA AHEAD 
LINDSAY TOOK BOTH IDEAS TO A FOCUS GROUP 
THE WHOLE POINT OF EMPLOYING A FOCUS GROUP IS TO GET SOME INDICATION AS TO WHAT THE MARKET WANTS 
POLICE ROBOT 
THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA 
THE CHILDREN LIKED THE ROBOT BETTER THAN THEY LIKED HER VERY WEIRD TEXTING TOY 
ANYONE ELSE WANT TO TAP HIS HAND YES PLEASE GENTLY THOUGH 
YOU IGNORE A FOCUS GROUP A FOCUS GROUP MADE UP OF YOUR TARGET MARKET AT YOUR OWN RISK 
PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY GOT ROBOTS SO FUNDAMENTALLY ARE WE GOING TO TAKE A RISK IS THE QUESTION 
I QUITE LIKE TAKING RISKS 
THE FACT THAT LINDSAY TURNED HER BACK TO THE WHOLE OF THE MARKET RESEARCH 
AND ALSO TO WHAT HER TEAM MEMBERS WERE ACTUALLY ADVISING HER DID SHOCK ME 
RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO ASSUME THAT BOTH PRODUCTS ARE VIABLE 
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ALL TO PUT MARKS OUT OF ONE HUNDRED 
YOU'VE GOT ONE HUNDRED POINTS TO ALLOCATE TO THESE TWO PRODUCTS 
IS IT EIGHTY TWENTY T. H. S. IS IT FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. 
AND I WANT YOU TO WRITE THEM ON A BIT OF PAPER 
I REMEMBER THINKING WELL PERHAPS I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TOY MARKET'S ALL ABOUT 
SHE'S SO CONVINCED AND SHE'S SO GOOD AND SHE'S SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS 
THAT PERHAPS THAT IS THE WINNING IDEA 
AND I THINK WE WERE ALL A BIT DUMBSTRUCK 
O. K. SCORES ON THE DOORS ARE 
SECRET SIGNALS TWO HUNDRED SIXTY OUT OF SIX HUNDRED ROBOT THREE HUNDRED FORTY 
WE AS A TEAM ARE SPLIT 
I THINK WHEN I ASKED THE GIRLS TO VOTE WHAT I WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO ACHIEVE WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE THEM 
TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT FOR THEMSELVES TO TRY AND GET THEM ON BOARD WITH ME RATHER THAN TO LISTEN 
TO WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY BECAUSE IN MY MIND THE ROBOT WAS JUST A USELESS PIECE OF PLASTIC 
I AS PROJECT MANAGER WANT TO TAKE A RISK 
I'M GOING TO TAKE A RISK ON SECRET SIGNALS 
IF ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE DEAD LIE DOWN 
WITH LINDSAY SHE HAD EVERYBODY SHE HAD THE FOCUS GROUP SHE HAD HER TEAM SHE HAD EVERYBODY TELLING HER 
THAT WHAT SHE WAS COMING UP WITH WAS A BUNCH OF OLD RUBBISH AND SHE STILL DIDN'T LISTEN 
I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE OPINIONS BUT PLEASE CAST THOSE ASIDE 
I REMEMBER NICK HE WAS OBSERVING THE GIRLS I REMEMBER HIM RAISING HIS EYEBROWS AND I THOUGHT 
YEAH THAT'S HOW I FEEL 
AND I THINK LINDSAY YOU MIGHT HAVE JUST TALKED YOURSELF INTO A BIT OF A FIRING HERE 
A LOT OF ENTREPRENEURS THEY TAKE RISKS THEY GO WITH THEIR HUNCH 
MANY MANY TIMES IT DOESN'T WORK BUT WHEN IT DOES THEY MAKE IT BIG 
MY OBSERVATIONS ARE THAT IT'S A BUNCH OF CARDS 
THAT'S MY CALL ON THIS AT THE MOMENT 
IT WASN'T A QUESTION OF 
BEING CONGRATULATED FOR BRAVERY IT'S A QUESTION OF BEING SMACKED ON THE HEAD FOR BEING STUPID 
LINDSAY 
IN MY OPINION 
YOU MADE THE BIGGEST ERROR 
YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY IN YOUR GRASP 
YOU HEARD FROM YOUR COLLEAGUES THAT THEY ALL FELT THAT THIS THING ACTUALLY HAD MORE LEGS THAN THAT 
AND YOU CHOSE TO IGNORE IT AND YOU MADE A DECISION IN THE END 
AND THAT DECISION I'M AFRAID TO SAY IS GONNA COST YOU 
LINDSAY YOU'RE FIRED THANKS 
FOR SOME REASON IT ALL CAME OUT THAT I WASN'T LISTENING TO MY TEAM 
WHICH WAS A BIT DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH ACTUALLY BECAUSE I DID 
I JUST DIDN'T AGREE WITH THEM 
LINDSAY GOT THE PRODUCT WRONG AND PAID THE PRICE 
IT WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE DEFEAT IN SERIES THREE 
WHEN ONE CANDIDATE LAUNCHED AN OFFENSIVE ON FRANCE 
WELL WE'VE ALL HEARD OF TAKING COALS TO NEWCASTLE AND PAUL AND THE CHEESE 
TO FRANCE FIASCO WAS REALLY COALS TO NEWCASTLE WRIT LARGE 
A YEAR AGO AND I'M STILL AFFECTED BY THAT TASK 
COMMANDED BY SIR ALAN TO SELL THE BEST OF BRITISH TO THE FRENCH 
FEARLESSLY LEADING HIS TROOPS ACROSS THE CHANNEL WAS EX MILITARY MAN PAUL CALLAGHAN 
I WAS RELISHING THE CHANCE TO 
TO HAVE A GO AND PROVE MY METTLE 
THE ARMY WAS FULL OF PAULS 
TRUMPED UP SECOND LIEUTENANTS 
WHO THOUGHT THEY HAD ALL THE AUTHORITY AND EXPERIENCE 
WHEN I WAS IN THE ARMY I WAS A TEAM COMMANDER 
THE WAY YOU CARRY OUT TASKS YOU CARRY OUT A MISSION ANALYSIS 
THEN PREPARE YOUR ORDERS AND GIVE YOUR ORDERS 
TIME NOW SEVEN THIRTY 
WE ARE LEAVING HERE AT EIGHT TWENTY YOU SHOULD HAVE ALL YOUR KIT PACKED 
HE'S THE KIND OF GUY THAT WILL HAVE DONE THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE NOT KNOWING WHAT HE'S DOING 
AND EVERYONE IN THE ARMY IS LIKE NO THAT'S NOT A GOOD CALL 
HE'S LIKE NO I'M TELLING YOU GO THAT WAY 
STRATEGIC MISTAKE NUMBER ONE CHOICE OF PRODUCT 
PAUL COMES UP WITH THIS BRILLIANT IDEA OF CHEESE 
WHICH I INSTANTLY THINK FRANCE CHEESE DON'T DO IT 
BUT I NODDED AND SAID YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA PAUL BRILLIANT JUST KNOWING IT WOULD HANG HIM 
IF THERE'S A CHEESE EATING NATION IN THE WORLD IT'S THE FRENCH 
YOU CERTAINLY DON'T DO WINE AND YOU DON'T DO CHEESE 
THOSE ARE THE TWO AREAS YOU STEER CLEAR OF 
HI WE'VE JUST BOUGHT THE CHEESE 
THERE'S NOW TWO HUNDRED EIGHT L. B. S. THIRTY KILOGRAMS OF CHEESE 
THE FRENCH ARE CONNOISSEURS AND WE'RE GONNA SELL THEM SOMETHING FROM MAKRO 
BUYING THE PRODUCT IS STAGE ONE 
IF YOU DON'T GET THAT RIGHT YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE GONE HOME 
SELLING THE ENTIRE CASH AND CARRY SUPPLY OF CHEESE FROM ENGLAND TO THE FRENCH 
WAS PROBABLY NEVER A PLAN DREAMT UP BY EINSTEIN 
FROMAGE ANGLAIS NON 
IT WAS QUITE A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT TO SELL STUFF IN 
BONJOUR 
FROMAGE ANGLAIS 
IT WAS HARDLY SURPRISING THAT THEY LOOK AT THIS CHALKY 
ERSATZ NASTY ENGLISH PRODUCT WITH ABSOLUTE HORROR AND DON'T BUY IT 
THEY BOYCOTT IT AS ONLY THE FRENCH CAN WITH REAL FRENCH ALACRITY LIKE NON MAIS NON 
AH SACRE BLEU FROMAGE URGH 
IT WOULD APPEAR THEY DON'T LIKE ENGLISH CHEESE SO WHAT'S TO LIKE ABOUT THE FRENCH 
I SENT YOU OUT ON A MISSION TO FRANCE 
TO SELL QUALITY BRITISH PRODUCTS 
AND I WANTED YOU TO TAKE THAT PRODUCT 
AND SAY THIS IS WHAT US BRITISH PRODUCE THIS IS NOT MASS PRODUCED TOOT 
AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GO AND BUY A BREEZE BLOCK LOAD OF BLOODY CHEDDAR CHEESE 
WE COULD HAVE PRESENTED THE CHEESE BETTER AND WHEN WE WERE BUYING IN BULK THAT'S HOW IT WAS PRESENTED 
AND WE COULD HAVE IMPROVE THE PRESENTATION SO I TAKE THAT 
THE PURPOSE OF ME PUTTING THE CASH AND CARRY ON THE LIST IN THE DOSSIER WAS NOT TO BUY THE FOOD THERE 
IT WAS TO GO AND BUY LITTLE BITS AND PIECES 
IT WAS QUITE CLEAR WHAT THE TASK WAS ALL ABOUT AND YOU DIDN'T DO THAT 
MISTAKE NUMBER TWO USE UNTESTED TECHNOLOGY 
YOU OPEN THAT END AND YOU OPEN THAT END YOU EMPTY OUT THE BEANS AND MAYBE EAT THEM FOR YOUR LUNCH 
YOU THEN OPEN THE TOP OF THIS MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT A FEW VENT HOLES 
IN THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM WHICH YOU CAN STAB THROUGH 
OPEN THE TOP OF THAT SET THAT ALIGHT STICK THAT IN THERE 
THEN PUT YOUR FRYING PAN ON TOP TO COOK THE SAUSAGES PERFECT 
HE HAS AS A LEGACY OF HIS ARMY CAREER SOME KIND OF NOTION OF HEATING UP SAUSAGES 
ON AN UPSIDE DOWN BAKED BEAN CAN WITH A CIGARETTE LIGHTER IN IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING 
TO BE HONEST I THOUGHT HE WAS JOKING 
HE WAS IN THE CAR GOING YOU DO THIS AND YOU DO THAT I THOUGHT HE WAS JUST SHOWING OFF 
WHEN I WAS STRUGGLING TO GET THE BURNER TO LIGHT I WAS TAKING THE PISS 
I JUST MADE SURE THAT MARGARET NICK AND EVERYBODY ELSE GOT TO SEE WHAT A COMPLETE CATASTROPHE IT WAS 
YEAH IT'S GONE OUT AGAIN SO 
TRYING TO HACK OUT A FULL SECTION 
IT WAS ACTUALLY VERY FUNNY WATCHING THE SAUSAGES FAILING TO SIZZLE ON THIS BAKED BEAN CAN 
OF COURSE IT DIDN'T WORK IT WAS A HEATH ROBINSON CONTRAPTION BACKFIRED AT THE CRUCIAL MOMENT 
HAVE YOU GOT A FLAME YEAH 
I WAS PUTTING MY FINGER ON THE FAT AND IT DIDN'T EVEN LIKE WARM MY FINGER UP 
THAT'S HOW COLD THAT FAT WAS 
IT'S A TOTAL BLOODY JOKE 
THE BURNER WE MADE DID BROWN OFF THE SAUSAGES AND THEY DID LOOK GOOD IS THIS A JOKE 
IS THIS SOME KIND OF SURVIVAL THING YOU WERE TRYING TO DO 
YOU BUY A CAN OF BEANS YOU EAT THE BEANS YOU USE 
THE CAN AS YOUR BURNER IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME 
IT BROWNS IT OFF AND I DID SHOW SOME OF THE BROWNED OFF SAUSAGES AND THAT DID INCREASE SALES 
IT WAS NOWHERE NEAR COOKING IT WAS SOMETHING YOU LEARNED ON THE BRECON BEACONS A SURVIVAL COURSE 
NO IT WAS JUST SOMETHING I COBBLED TOGETHER CERTAINLY THAT 
YOU'RE AN EX MILITARY MAN WHO KNOWS BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE THAT THE BUCK STOPS THERE 
MISTAKE NUMBER THREE WAS THE WORST BRING ADAM BACK INTO THE BOARDROOM 
WHAT'S ADAM DOING HERE THE REASON WHY I BROUGHT ADAM HERE WAS COS I FEEL 
THAT ON THE TASK ITSELF HE WASN'T PERFORMING TO HIS MAXIMUM I THOUGHT HE WAS OUT OF HIS DEPTH 
IN FACT I THINK THAT ADAM'S ONE OF THE WEAKEST PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE 
ADAM WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY KATIE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHOSEN 
COS SHE WAS INVOLVED IN MAKING THE DECISIONS THAT MADE IT GO WRONG 
WHY DON'T YOU THINK HE CHOSE KATIE 
HE DECIDED NOT TO CHOOSE KATIE BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO CLOSE THEY'RE TOO GOOD FRIENDS 
I HELPED FUCK HIM RIGHT UP SET UP THE BOARDROOM WHEN I SAID 
HE WERE TOO CLOSE TO KATIE KNOWING THAT KRISTINA WAS JUST DYING TO SAY THAT THEY HAD BEEN GETTING IT ON 
FRIENDS YEAH WHY ARE YOU NODDING YOUR HEAD 
THEY'VE GOT A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT 
AS IN THAT THEY'RE TOGETHER OUTSIDE THE TASK THAT IS NOT THE CASE YOU KNOW IT IS IT ISN'T 
SPILLING THE BEANS WAS SIMPLY SNAKE IN THE GRASS STUFF 
IF SHE SITS ON YOUR LAP AND YOU'RE STROKING EACH OTHER AND GOD KNOWS WHAT THAT'S A RELATIONSHIP 
I WAS LIVID AND I WAS SO ANGRY THAT THEY'D STOOP SO LOW 
ANYTHING THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF SOMETHING THAT'S RELATED TO BUSINESS SHOULD BE DEALT WITH 
PAUL I SENT YOU OUT TO SELL THE BEST OF BRITISH TO FRANCE 
YOU SPEND HALF THE BLOODY DAY FRYING SAUSAGES ON SOME STUPID CONTRAPTION THAT THE BOY SCOUTS COULD HAVE MADE 
AND WORSE THAN THAT PAUL YOU WENT OUT AND LOST ME MONEY 
YOU'RE A TOTAL SHAMBLES 
YOU'RE FIRED 
THANK YOU SIR ALAN 
I THINK PAUL ABSOLUTELY ROUNDLY AND RESOUNDINGLY DESERVED TO BE FIRED 
BECAUSE HE SO BADLY MISJUDGED THE WHOLE THING FROM START TO FINISH 
FROM PRODUCT TO EXECUTION THE WHOLE THING WAS THE DAMPEST OF POSSIBLE SQUIBS AND HE HAD TO GO 
IT WAS AU REVOIR REALLY 
IN BUSINESS ATTENTION TO DETAIL CAN MAKE OR BREAK A PRODUCT 
AS ONE TEAM FOUND WHEN A SIMPLE ORDER PROVED A COSTLY MISTAKE 
WE NEED ONE HUNDRED CHICKENS THE BLOODY CHICKENS 
IT'S GOT TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST MISTAKES ANYBODY HAS EVER MADE 
THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE TASKS 
WE ALL REFERRED TO WELL IT CAN'T BE AS BAD AS THE CHICKEN THING 
BASICALLY THEY'RE FRESH PIECES HAND MADE 
THE TASK TO MAKE AND SELL FAST FOOD AT THE THAMES FESTIVAL 
FIFTY P. A SLICE PIZZA SWEET AND SOUR CHICKEN NOODLES 
ONE A SLICE OF PIZZA D'YOU MIND IF I JUST YES OF COURSE 
THE LOSING TEAM WERE OVERWHELMED BY ONE MAN AND HIS EGO 
PIZZA IS BRILLIANT BECAUSE IT'S GOING FOR A NICHE IT'S GOING FOR A SPECIALIST AREA 
AND IN MY EXPERIENCE RUNNING BUSINESSES THAT IS THE WAY FORWARD 
SELF STYLED BUSINESS BAD BOY SYED AHMED 
THIS IS US V. THEM RIGHT WIN OR LOSE 
YOU'RE NOT A DETAIL MAN ARE YOU IF YOU'RE AFTER A TOP PERFORMER YOU'RE LOOKING AT A TOP PERFORMER 
I COME FROM A VERY HARD WORKING BACKGROUND I GREW UP IN EAST LONDON I'VE LEARNED LIFE THE HARD WAY 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE DYNAMIC LEAD FROM THE FRONT 
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION 
THAT SYED HAD A HUGE AMOUNT OF RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE 
I'VE GOT IT EIGHT I'VE GOT EIGHT YEARS' PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE 
MANAGING AND ACTUALLY WORKING AND DOING SERVICE YOU KNOW WAITING AS A WAITER 
I RECKON AN EXPERT IN CATERING 
MAYBE HE WAS A WAITER ONCE IN A RESTAURANT 
BUT CERTAINLY NO EXPERT IN CATERING 
BUT IF HE WALKED INTO A RESTAURANT AND KNEW SOMEONE WHO WORKED THERE 
HE'D SAY I'VE RUN A RESTAURANT YOU KNOW HE'S THAT KIND OF GUY 
I JUST HAD THIS IMPRESSION FROM WHAT HE WAS SAYING THAT THIS WAS HIS AREA 
YOU TRUST EVERYONE UNTIL THEY DISAPPOINT YOU AND WITH SYED THAT'S WHAT WE DID 
IT'S CRUCIAL WITH MY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU AND I WE GET ALONG LIKE MUSIC 
THAT'S IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION HAS TO FLOW 
WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW TEAM MEMBERS YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING AS TRUE 
I THOUGHT WE HAD THE MAKINGS FOR A GREAT PERFORMANCE 
WE NEED ONE HUNDRED CHICKENS WE NEED THIRTY KILOS OF MINCED BEEF 
AND WE NEED FORTY FIVE KILOS OF GAMMON WHICH IS BONED AND ROLLED GAMMON OFF THE BONE 
O. K. SO I'LL REPEAT THAT AGAIN 
FORTY FIVE KILOS OF GAMMON MINCED BEEF THIRTY KILOS CHICKEN ONE HUNDRED CHICKENS 
YOU DON'T JUST ORDER A CHICKEN THERE ARE CHICKENS AND CHICKENS 
THERE ARE POUSSIN THERE ARE CAPONS THERE ARE BIG FAT CHICKENS BOILING CHICKENS SMALL ROASTERS 
CHICKENS AREN'T JUST CHICKENS 
YOU CAN'T JUST ORDER ONE HUNDRED CHICKENS AND EXPECT SOME KIND OF HOMOGENOUS BIRD TO FLY IN 
THE CHICKENS THAT ARRIVED WERE ALMOST TURKEY SIZED 
IN FACT THEY WERE SO BIG YOU COULD ONLY FIT FOUR OF THEM IN THE INDUSTRIAL OVEN 
AND HE'D ORDERED ONE HUNDRED 
A HORROR STORY 
JUST A QUICK UPDATE WE MADE A WRONG ASSUMPTION WHICH HAS PUT US SLIGHTLY IN THE SHIT 
THE MAIN RESPONSIBILITY NOW IS TO GET THE PIZZAS DONE 
WHEN PEOPLE KNOW THEY'RE IN THE SHIT SO TO SPEAK THEY KNOW TO TRY TO GET THEMSELVES OUT OF IT 
AND THEY TRY AND SCAPEGOAT OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY TRY TO TALK ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS 
AND IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL A FEW CHICKENS EXTRA HERE AND THERE AND I WAS LIKE IT'S A MASSIVE DEAL 
THIS IS GOING TO BE BIG THIS IS GOING TO BE HILARIOUS 
YES WE ARE IN THE SHIT WE NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION 
THE POINT WAS THAT THERE WAS A TURKEY SIZED CHICKEN FOR EVERY PIZZA AND PIZZA ONLY HAS SIX SLICES 
SO YOU HAVE A SIXTH OF A TURKEY SIZED CHICKEN FOR EVERY PIZZA IT'S NONSENSE 
SO THERE'S ONE HUNDRED CHICKENS AND ONE HUNDRED CHICKEN TIKKA PIZZAS A CHICKEN PER PIZZA 
THAT'S IT SOUNDS QUITE A BIG THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF CHICKENS 
IT'S TOO MANY CHICKENS 
A CHICKEN PER PIZZA 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE A BREAST FORMING OVER THIS BIG PIZZA 
THAT SIMPLE CALCULATION OF ONE HUNDRED CHICKENS FOR ONE HUNDRED CHICKEN PIZZAS 
TOTALLY TOTALLY RIDICULOUS 
WE WERE TOLD THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE HALF A MILLION PEOPLE 
AND THAT'S WHY I ORDERED ONE HUNDRED CHICKENS 
NO YOU FOOL 
DID ONE OF HIS BRAIN CELLS FALL OUT OF HIS HEAD AND JUST LEAVE ONE IN THERE 
BECAUSE THAT'S SO OBVIOUS THAT YOU DON'T NEED A WHOLE CHICKEN FOR A PIZZA 
SYED'S OVER ORDERING BLEW THE BUDGET NO AMOUNT OF SELLING COULD TURN HIS 
MOUNTAIN OF CHICKENS INTO A PROFIT 
DISASTER RECOVERY WAS JUST TOO BIG TO MANAGE AND WE WEREN'T GOING TO DO IT 
AS SOON AS WE REALISED IT WAS JUST TOO LATE TO PULL IT BACK 
ANYONE INTERESTED IN PIZZA FOR THIS EVENING NO THANK YOU O. K. 
I COULD SELL A PIECE OF PIZZA TO EVERYONE IN LONDON AND WE WOULDN'T MAKE A PROFIT 
IT WAS LIKE SO BAD IT WAS HILARIOUS 
A POUND A SLICE HERE WE GO 
COME ON GUYS WHO WANTS IT A POUND A SLICE FANTASTIC 
THEY NEVER HAD A PRAYER OF MAKING ANY MONEY 
AND THEY DIDN'T 
GIVE ME TWO I'LL GIVE YOU PIZZA FOR NOTHING 
A POUND A SLICE OF PIZZA COME ON LADIES GET A SLICE OF THE ACTION DRINKS AS WELL 
I REMEMBER VOLLEYING CHICKENS INTO THE THAMES IN THE END AND THROWING CHICKENS IN THE BACK OF A BIKE 
I'VE BEEN IN A LOT OF BOARDROOMS WITH SIR ALAN AND MARGARET I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM SO ANGRY 
YOU MESSED IT UP DIDN'T YOU YOU MESSED IT UP I'VE LEARNED A LESSON SIR ALAN DEFINITELY 
I'M BLOODY SURE YOU'VE LEARNED A LESSON NO QUESTION OF THAT 
IT'S A WONDER WHY THE LESSON CAME SO LATE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS 
I'VE MANAGED RESTAURANTS YOU MANAGED UNDER MARCO PIERRE WHITE OR SOMETHING 
THE TITANIC THERE'S ANOTHER BLOODY DISASTER YOU'RE IN NOW 
BUSINESS ISN'T ABOUT COME IN PISS MY MONEY UP THE WALL OH NEVER MIND 
SORRY YOU LOST IT NOW YOU'VE LEARNT YOU WON'T DO IT AGAIN 
HOW DID HE NOT GET FIRED BASED ON THAT 
THANKS SIR ALAN THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY 
CHEEKY BASTARD THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY 
I THINK HE WAS FOND OF ME YOU KNOW 
FROM A BUSINESS SENSE SIR ALAN SAW A LOT OF HIM IN ME 
FOR ASPIRING APPRENTICES ANOTHER DECISION IS KNOW YOUR MARKET 
THIS SET ON THE WALL THAT'S CALLED VERY COOL FAMILY ALBUM 
IN SERIES THREE PLUNGED INTO THE MARKET FOR ART TWO OF THE 
STRONGEST CANDIDATES LET THEIR OWN TASTE COLOUR THEIR JUDGEMENT 
I THINK MOST ART IS BOLLOCKS STUPID TITTIES AND FISH 
I TOTALLY LOST MY VOICE AND I DID WANT TO JUST GO OUTSIDE AND WEEP 
BECAUSE I DIDN'T MAKE MY SALE 
SHE'S REALLY PUSHED THE BOUNDARIES OF WHERE SHE'S AT WITH THIS STUFF 
HERE YOU HAD TWO BUNCHES OF PEOPLE 
WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT EITHER ART OR PHOTOGRAPHY 
SUDDENLY REQUIRED TO SELL IT AND MAKE THE BEST FIST OF IT THAT THEY COULD 
I FEEL THAT WE NEED TO BE VERY MUCH MORE AWARE AND ART IS VERY STRONG AND VERY POWERFUL 
NIPPLES JUST DON'T NEED IT AT ALL AND WHO THE HELL 
WANTS TO SEE THEM WITH FISH LAYING ACROSS THEM 
ISN'T THAT THE MOST OFF PUTTING PICTURE YOU COULD IMAGINE 
BECAUSE OF HIS NO BULLSHIT MANNER 
HE JUST COULDN'T COPE WITH IT 
IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH THIS TASK HAD BEEN DESIGNED FOR TRE 
THERE ARE CERTAIN PIECES OF ART WHICH JUST MAKE NO SENSE TO ME AND THAT WAS THE PROBLEM I HAD 
WITH A LOT OF THE ART I COULDN'T SELL SOMETHING I THOUGHT WAS RUBBISH 
ALL OF HER PAINTINGS HAVE GOT PARTS OF THE BODY AND YOU'RE EXCLUDING THEM BECAUSE THERE ARE TITS ON THEM 
YEAH BUT HOW DO TITS FIT INTO IT THE SAME WAY IT'S ALL BODY 
YEAH BUT JUST BECAUSE I'LL PUT THEM UP FOR YOU BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SELL THEM 
TO ME IT WAS CRASS AND UNNECESSARY AND THAT'S WHEN I REALLY THOUGHT 
OH THIS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A STORY UP AROUND IT BUT I DID 
YOU BEGIN WITH A TITLE A FISH'S TAIL AND THEN YOU WALK FROM THERE AND THEN YOU GO STRAIGHT 
INTO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ART IN TERMS OF THE CALLOUS DISREGARD FOR THE OCEAN 
TRE HAD TO BE IN THAT BASEMENT FOR THREE OR FOUR HOURS 
HE MIGHT AS WELL ENJOY EVERY MOMENT OF IT 
AND PUT HIS OWN BIT OF BULL INTO IT SO I THINK FAIR PLAY TO YOU 
THERE'S A GUY NOT BELIEVING IN IT AND ABSOLUTELY BULLSHITTING IN FRONT OF PEOPLE WHO REGULARLY 
COME TO ART GALLERIES AND PROBABLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT 
THE WOMAN HAS THE ABILITY TO GIVE BIRTH AND THE OCEAN HAS THE ABILITY TO GIVE BIRTH 
THE WOMB OF THE SEA PRODUCING FOOD 
ESSENTIALLY CRUCIFY OURSELVES BY CRUCIFYING THE OCEAN THE OCEAN 
GIVES BIRTH TO US AND STUFF LIKE THAT OR WHATEVER IT WAS 
MUCH LIKE A PIRANHA IT'S A SMALL BITE THAT ENDS IN TOTAL ANNIHILATION 
AND ESSENTIALLY DECAPITATION OF MANKIND FROM THE OCEAN 
FANTASTIC HOW WAS THAT FOR YOU 
THAT WAS GREAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN TAKE A BREATH 
I KNOW THAT THEY SAY THERE'S A STORY BEHIND IT AND IT WAS EMOTION AND RAGE IT'S CRAP 
IF TRE WAS A FISH OUT OF WATER KATIE THOUGHT SHE WAS IN HER ELEMENT 
BRING US INTO YOUR WORLD IT WOULD BE BRILLIANT JUST TO KNOW YOU 
I THINK KATIE IN PARTICULAR GOT CARRIED AWAY WITH THE WHOLE IDEA AND GLAMOUR 
AND THIS ARTY WORLD AND THAT SORT OF THING AND LOST SIGHT OF WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY THERE TO DO 
MY JOB WAS TO COMPLIMENT THEM TO MAKE THEM BELIEVE THAT WE REALLY WANTED TO WORK WITH THEM 
AND TO MAKE THEM BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE OUR FIRST CHOICE 
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO AND THAT'S WHY I WENT ART CRITIC CRAZY 
WHAT DROVE YOU TO THIS WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION REALLY WHO ARE YOU 
KATIE WAS ON DRUGS OR ON ANOTHER PLANET 
OR TRYING TO BECOME AN ART CRITIC 
I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE BUT SHE TALKED A LOT OF SHIT AND THAT 
WAS JUST AN ABSOLUTE CAST IRON EXAMPLE OF SHIT THAT SHE TALKS 
THE WORK IS REALLY THE STORY OF THE OCEAN AND THE LIFE WITHIN OOH 
AH OOH WHAT A FUCKING IDIOT 
WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT MAKING THIS WORK 
IF YOU CAN JUST BRING US INTO YOUR WORLD AND LET US UNDERSTAND HOW THIS HAPPENED WHERE HAVE YOU COME FROM 
LET ME GET INTO YOUR WORLD LET ME SEE WHAT YOU'RE ALL ABOUT 
WE WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU THE ARTIST IS ALL ABOUT 
HOW YOU CAME ABOUT TO THIS AND ALL OF THAT STUFF IT WOULD BE BRILLIANT JUST TO KNOW YOU 
KATIE WAS WETTING HER KNICKERS IN THE EXCITEMENT OF BEING IN THE PRESENCE OF A GREAT AMERICAN 
PHOTOGRAPHER OF WHOM NO ONE IN LONDON HAD EVER HEARD 
FOR ME THE LIPS ARE YOU KNOW THE SORT OF CENTRE OF COMMUNICATION 
BUT THEY'RE ALSO SENSUAL THEY'RE ALSO SEXUAL 
YOU 
I THINK YOU WENT INTO A KIND OF I'M AN ARTIST MODE HERE ON THIS PARTICULAR TASK 
YOU WANTED TO GET IN WITH THE ART MOB AND ALL THAT TYPE OF STUFF AND 
FORGETTING ABOUT THE KILLER POINT OF SELLING STUFF REALLY 
BORN TO SCHMOOZE KATIE DISMISSED EVERYONE ON HER TEAM 
NOT LEAST CAR SALESMAN ADAM 
I WOULDN'T EVEN SEE ADAM AS A CONTENDER TO SELL FIAT PUNTOS AT A CAR SALES LOT 
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD SO FAR THEN 
I HAVEN'T SOLD ANY OF THESE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY'RE BEING OFFERED FOR SALE 
ADAM HAD ALL THE ARTISTIC SUBTLETY OF AN ELEPHANT 
HE WAS RUDE TO THE ARTIST AND HE WAS WAY OFF ON THE PRICING 
JUST SHOWING THAT HE HAS NO EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD 
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU WANT FOR EACH NINE FIFTY FOR THE SMALL NINE POINT FIVE OH NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
I WAS TAKING THE PISS 
AND EVERYONE WAS LIKE OH THICK GIT HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH THEY ARE I WAS WINDING HER UP 
TRYING TO MAKE A POINT THAT IS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE 
THEY'LL BE SELLING LIKE FUCKING CRAZY THERE'S MIDDLE GROUND HERE WE'VE GOT TO DO 
I HEARD YOU SAY HAVE YOU BOUGHT THIS SORT OF THING BEFORE WHAT SORT OF PRICE WOULD YOU BUY IT AT 
FUCKING FORGET ABOUT THE ART LET'S LOOK AT SELL 
THAT'S THE KEY WORD IN THIS THING SELL THE STUFF MAKE THE MONEY IT'S A FUCKING BUSINESS PROGRAMME 
TOO HEAVY FOOTED 
WE NEED TO HAVE LITTLE BALLET SHOES ON AND WE NEED TO DANCE 
IN TERMS OF HER FUNCTION AS A BUSINESS WOMAN IT MADE NO SENSE AT ALL 
YOU HAVE TO BE QUITE TOUGH ABOUT THESE THINGS CAN I SELL IT 
TO WHOM DO I SELL IT HOW DO I SELL IT WHEN 
BUT WHEN THE GALLERY OPENED KATIE'S CHARM OFFENSIVE STALLED 
WE CAN SEE ALL THESE IMAGES IN OUR HEAD AND THEN SHE MANAGED TO RECREATE THEM IN ONE DAY 
I THOUGHT KATIE YOU'RE QUITE GOOD AT THIS THEN I REALISED SHE WASN'T 
SHE'S REALLY PUSHED THE BOUNDARIES OF WHERE SHE'S AT WITH THIS STUFF YES 
SHE WAS HOPELESS 
KATIE HAD GOT CARRIED AWAY WITH MEANINGLESS ARTISTIC GOBBLEDEGOOK IT'S ALL COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT 
I REALLY SOLD MY HEART OUT THAT NIGHT AND DIDN'T MAKE ONE SINGLE SALE 
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR THOUGHTS BUT ADAM SOLD TWO 
IT WAS AWESOME TO OUTSELL KATIE HER FACE WAS A CLASSIC AND SHE STILL COULDN'T ADMIT SHE WAS WRONG 
SO WHILST I HOLD MY HAND UP TO THE FACT THAT HE DID SELL THAT DAY AND GOOD ON HIM AND I DIDN'T 
I STILL THINK HE LACKS SUBTLETY 
SHE STILL HAD TO SIT THERE SAYING THAT SHE WAS RIGHT AND I WAS WRONG AND IT WAS A FLUKE 
BULLSHIT LET'S DO IT AGAIN TAKE YOU ON AGAIN NOT A PROBLEM 
YOU WANT TO GO WITH THAT DOWN THAT ROUTE I'LL TAKE YOU ON AGAIN ANY DAY AND WIPE THE FLOOR WITH YOU 
IF SELLING TO A NICHE MARKET CAN BE TOUGH SELLING TO THE MASS MARKET CAN BE EVEN HARDER 
AS SIMON AMBROSE DISCOVERED WHEN HE WENT LIVE ON T. V. 
IT'S VERY EASY JUST TO UNSCREW THE LEGS 
IT WAS THE OPPOSITE OF TITILLATING ALTHOUGH IT WAS FAINTLY OBSCENE AT THE SAME TIME 
I CAN JUST OPEN MY LEGS LIKE SO 
BUT HE SURVIVED AND SIMON WOULD GO ON TO BECOME THE APPRENTICE 
SIMON YOU'RE HIRED 
YES THANK YOU SIR ALAN THANK YOU SO MUCH 
YET WHEN IT CAME TO SELLING ON T. V. HE MADE SOME STRANGE DECISIONS 
PRESS THIS THING THERE IT GOES DOWN YEAH 
NOT A WHEELCHAIR I'VE JUST SEEN A WHEELCHAIR SIMON YES YOU HAVE SEEN A WHEELCHAIR 
HOW MANY PEOPLE SPONTANEOUSLY BUY A WHEELCHAIR WHAT KIND OF AN IMPULSE PURCHASE IS IT 
DO YOU NOT THINK IT'S A VERY VERY NICHE PRODUCT 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO SELL A WHEELCHAIR IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO NEED WHEELCHAIRS WATCHING 
PEOPLE WHO ARE INFIRM AT HOME WATCHING T. V. WILL WANT THIS 
I JUST KNEW PEOPLE WOULDN'T BUY IT 
THEY'LL WANT THIS 
WHAT DO I WANT WELL ACTUALLY I'M PERFECTLY ABLE BODIED 
A WHEELCHAIR WILL COME IN HANDY MAYBE I'LL BUY IT FOR SOMEONE WHO MIGHT NEED IT WHAT 
IT COMES WITH A PUMP AS WELL 
WHEN IT WAS HIS TURN TO RUN THE SHOW FROM THE GALLERY IT GOT WORSE 
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON BECAUSE IT'S NOT SELLING 
WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS THAT SIMON WHO'S A VERY ARTICULATE INTELLIGENT BLOKE 
WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE MICROPHONE AS A PRODUCER IN THE GALLERY DRIED UP 
WE HADN'T MUCH SLEEP THE NIGHT BEFORE 
I WASN'T IN THE BEST OF SORTS REALLY TO BE GOING OFF 
TRYING TO ORGANISE CAMERA ANGLES 
WE'RE GOING TO GO FROM THIS ANGLE TO THAT ANGLE 
AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT CARD UP AND WE'VE GOT TO GET THE SHOT READY AND CAMERA TWO IN POSITION 
I WAS NOT IN THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND 
WE HAVE IT AVAILABLE IN FOUR COLOURS FOR YOU WHAT ARE THEY 
WHAT ARE THE COLOURS YEAH GO ON ANSWER ME 
THEY ARE 
BLUE COME ON SPEED UP 
BLUE TURN TO THE BLUE YOU'VE GOT TO FLOW MAN 
SIMON WAS A TERRIBLE PRODUCER 
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DIRECTING TRE PRODUCING THE SHOW 
BUT HE LOOKED LIKE A RABBIT WITH MYXOMATOSIS CAUGHT IN THE HEADLIGHTS 
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY 
TELL HIM WHAT YOU WANT TO DO NEXT NOW I WANT YOU TO GO THROUGH THE COLOUR OPTIONS 
I THINK IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT MEN BEING ABLE TO DO ONE THING AT THE TIME 
HAVING BEEN IN A T. V. PRODUCTION STUDIO LIVE T. V. PRODUCTION I CAN COMPLETELY AGREE 
WHATEVER YOU WANT HIM TO SAY YOU'VE GOT TO GET HIM TO SAY IT 
GIVE ME MY NEWSPAPER GIVE ME MY FOOTBALL LET ME SIT DOWN 
READ MY NEWSPAPER WATCH THE FOOTBALL AND GO TO SLEEP 
PLEASE DON'T PUT ME IN A T. V. PRODUCTION STUDIO 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON GET ME OUT 
IT'S GOT ANTI SLIP BACKING 
BLUE HAS SOLD OUT LIMITED STOCK IN RED 
LIM RED IS LIMITED STOCK CARPETING WE'VE JUST BEEN TOLD THAT THE TERRACOTTA IS RUNNING OUT 
WE DO HAVE LIMITED STOCK LEFT SO IF YOU WANT THE TERRACOTTA YOU NEED TO MOVE NOW 
NO WE DIDN'T SAY TERRACOTTA YOU SAID RED 
YOU WERE TRYING TO CONFUSE HIM NO I WASN'T I SAID RED YOU SAID RED BUT THEY SAID THE WRONG DETAILS 
GET THEM TO CHANGE IT IT'LL BE WRONG ON THE SCREEN 
BROWN NOT TERRACOTTA BROWN NO RED 
THEN SIMON WENT LIVE TO THE NATION 
AND PROVED THAT WINNERS CAN SOMETIMES TURN THEMSELVES INTO LOSERS 
THREE TWO ONE ZERO AND CUE 
SIMON AND THE TRAMPOLINE IS THE BEST T. V. MOMENT EVER 
HI WE'VE GOT SOME LOVELY PRODUCTS TO SHOW YOU IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR 
SIMON AND THE TRAMPOLINE OH MY GOD 
HE GAVE US ONE OF THE T. V. MOVEMENTS OF ALL TIME 
WE'RE HERE AT THE BOUNCER HERE WE ARE 
IF I EVER HAD ANY DOUBTS OR ANY THOUGHTS OR ANY ASPIRATIONS TO BE ANYWHERE IN THAT WORLD 
I WAS PUT OFF THAT DAY COMPLETELY 
IT LOOKS EASY BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO DO IT ARE PARTICULARLY TALENTED AT DOING IT 
IF YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE IT'S DAMNED DIFFICULT 
THIS IS AN INTERESTING EXERCISE TOOL FOR YOU DEMO ON THE TRAMPOLINE SI 
WHY DON'T I HAVE A GO SHALL I HAVE A GO ON IT 
DON'T DON'T DON'T 
HE IS OH MY GOD WHAT A PILLOCK 
AS YOU CAN SEE I CAN JUST BOUNCE ON IT QUITE LIGHTLY 
I'M REALLY SMILING AND ENJOYING IT AND I CAN DO ONE FOOT UP WHICH IS THE LIGHT RUNNING ON THE SPOT 
GET BACK TO THE PRODUCT SI 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHOW YOU JUST HOW EASY THIS THING IS TO INSTALL 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WEREN'T CREASED UP ON THE FLOOR WATCHING THAT 
AND IT'S JUST SIX SIMPLE LEGS HERE WHICH YOU JUST SIMPLY JUST SCREW ON LIKE SO 
HOW DID HE NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS HE DOING IT ON PURPOSE 
IT LITERALLY WILL TAKE YOU JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO ASSEMBLE 
I'VE ALREADY DONE ONE 
O. K. HE MAY NOT HAVE NOTICED STRAIGHT AWAY THAT HE WAS SCREWING A LEG ON RIGHT BY HIS CRUTCH 
AND IF I DO THE SECOND ONE HERE 
YOU'LL SEE HOW EASY THAT IS 
LOOK WHERE YOU'VE GOT THE BLOODY THING RESTING ON 
I JUST REMEMBER MYSELF AT THE T. V. OH HE'S NOT DOING THAT 
SO IT'S PORTABLE IF YOU MOVE HOUSE YOU COULD JUST PUT IT IN THE CAR OR PUT IT UNDER YOUR BED 
I HAD NO IDEA AT ALL ABOUT HOW MY TRAMPOLINE ASSEMBLY SKILLS WERE BEING PORTRAYED AND BEING RECEIVED 
I NEARLY GAGGED ON MY FOOD I WAS JUST LIKE 
IT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING FROM THE MOST EXPLICIT PORN AND IT WAS JUST MARVELLOUS THAT GESTURE 
THAT HE KEPT ON REPLICATING AND YOU KNEW HE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING 
IT'S LOW IMPACT AND YOU CAN HAVE A FUN TIME ON IT 
I HAD NO CONCEPT OF THE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE OF WHAT I WAS DOING NONE AT ALL 
THE FIRST THING I KNEW ABOUT IT IS WHEN NAOMI SAID IN MY EAR STOP PUTTING THE LEGS ON THE TRAMPOLINE 
SO I STARTED UNSCREWING THEM 
IT REALLY IS VERY EASY JUST TO UNSCREW THE LEGS 
YOU CAN SEE HOW QUICKLY IT TOOK ME TO TAKE THAT OFF 
NO STOP IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE WANKING I THOUGHT OH 
LIKE A RABBIT IN THE HEADLIGHTS I REALLY WAS I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK I WAS LIKE 
WHAT DID I DO MUM 
I'LL PUT IT ON AGAIN QUICKLY 
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS WILL GO DOWN 
I CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH BECAUSE I NEARLY FELL OUT OF MY CHAIR 
YOUR STAR JUMP 
IT'S SO PATHETIC THAT I HAVE TO LAUGH MYSELF 
HONESTLY GUYS AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME WE'RE DYING 
IS THAT REALLY BAD YEAH 
IT'S NOT MY FAULT I'M INNOCENT 
EVERYONE ELSE OUT THERE ARE THE DIRTY MINDED ONES 
I CAN ONLY ATTEST TO BEING AN INNOCENT PERSON 
SIMON LIVED TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY BUT OTHERS HAVEN'T BEEN SO LUCKY 
NARGIS YOU'RE FIRED I WISH I'D PLAYED THE GAME AND I 
SHOULD HAVE DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN ORDER TO SECURE MY STAY 
IN MY OPINION YOU MADE THE BIGGEST ERROR 
I MADE A MISTAKE BY SIZING UP THE COMPETITION AND LABELLING EVERYBODY ELSE AS BEING SOMEBODY I COULD BEAT 
YOU'RE FIRED I'D NEVER REALLY COME ACROSS AN EXPERIENCE WHERE I'D LOST MY NERVE 
WHEN YOU GET IN THERE I THINK YOU REALISE JUST HOW VERY HUMAN YOU ARE AND HOW YOU CAN BREAK 
SIMON YOU'RE HIRED 
I THINK TO BE THE APPRENTICE IT'S A GIVEN YOU'VE GOT TO BE INTELLIGENT 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE DILIGENT HARD WORKING IT'S A MUST 
BE PROFESSIONAL DON'T LET YOUR PROFESSIONALISM SLIP 
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S A JOB INTERVIEW 
A JOB INTERVIEW FROM HELL BUT IT'S A JOB INTERVIEW SIMPLE AS THAT 
I WANT YOU BACK BY THE JACKSON FIVE 
WHEN I AD YOU TO MYSELF 
I DIDN'T WANT YOU AROUND 
THOSE PRETTY FACES ALWAYS MADE YA 
STAND OUT IN THE CROWD 
THEN SOMEONE PICKED YOU FROM THE BUNCH 
ONE GLANCE WAS ALL IT TOOK 
NOW IT'S MUCH TOO LATE FOR ME 
TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK 
OH DARLIN' I WAS BLIND TO LET YOU GO 
BUT NOW SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU IN HER ARMS I WANT YOU BACK 
INTRODUCING THE JACKSON FIVE
