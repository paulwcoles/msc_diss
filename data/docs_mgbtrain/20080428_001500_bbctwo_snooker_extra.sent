I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE GAME 
WE BOTH GOT SIMILAR GAMES WE BOTH 
GOT A TACTICAL GAME EACH 
WE ARE 
APPROACHING THE SECOND WEEK AND TO 
STILL BE INVOLVED IS WHAT I WANT TO 
DO I'M STILL IN IT SO THEREFORE I 
AM HAPPY AND LOOKING FORWARD TO 
PLAYING 
THAT IS STUART BAIN PLAYING BINGHAM AND JOE PERRY SOUNDING IN 
POSITIVE MOOD AHEAD OF THEIR 
SECOND ROUND MATCH THIS PROGRAMME 
IS GOING TO FEATURE THE ACTION WE 
WILL JOIN 
IT AT 
THE START OF FRAME 
TWO JOE PERRY TO BREAK STUART 
BINGHAM WON THE FIRST FRAME THE 
COMMENTATORS ARE WILLIE THORNE AND 
TERRY GRIFFITHS 
JUST TO REMIND PEOPLE IT IS A NEW 
CLOTH AND CUSHIONS TODAY SO IT 
WILL 
TAKE A 
WHILE TO GET USED TO 
THE STRENGTH 
WE CAN'T BELIEVE THAT JOE PERRY HAS 
PLAYED ANOTHER BAD SAFETY I 
CAN'T BELIEVE HE MADE THREE POOR 
ONES IN THE FIRST FRAME AND IT COST 
HIM IN THE END HE IS NORMALLY VERY 
VERY STRONG ON THAT SIDE OF THE 
GAME 
OF COURSE THAT WIN IN THE OPENING 
FRAME WILL SETTLE STUART BINGHAM 
DOWN A BIT HE WILL BE NOTICING 
THAT JOE PERRY IS NOT QUITE WITH IT 
THERE WAS ONE RED DOWN ON THE BACK 
CUSHION BLACK 
HE HAS TO AVOID BLUE AND GREEN ON 
THE WAY BACK 
OBVIOUSLY COULDN'T AVOID THE BLUE 
NOW HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF A LITTLE 
BIT OF DISTANCE PROBABLY WILL TAKE 
THE YELLOW L. THINK THAT AFFORDS 
HIM THE BEST CHANCE TO GET BACK 
DOWN FOR THE REDS 
IT LOOKS AS IF A FEW REDS WILL GO 
AT THE BACK THERE YES THERE IS TO 
THAT GO HE COULD HAVE DONE WITH 
COMING OUT A LITTLE BIT FROM THE 
CUSHION THERE IS TWO THAT GO 
IT HAS BEEN A MATCH OF ERRORS SO 
FAR 
I THINK JOE PERRY FLICKED THE RED 
BELOW THE BLACK THAT HAS TAKEN THE 
PACE OUT OF THE CUE BALL HE IS NOT 
WHAT ON ONE IN THE LEFT CENTRE 
JOE PERRY IS REALLY STRUGGLING OUT 
THERE AT THE MOMENT THIS IS NOT 
THE START HE WAS LOOKING FOR A LOT 
OF UNFORCED ERRORS 
NO EASY SHOT BACK INTO BAULK HE 
CAN'T PLAY AROUND THE BACK BECAUSE 
THE RED ISN'T THE WAY THE BLACK 
IF HE PLAYS THIS THIN WITH CHECK 
SIDE THERE IS PLENTY THAT COULD GO 
WRONG WITH THIS SHOT THE ONLY ONE 
THAT IS DEATHLY ON IS TO PLAY THE 
TWO 
REDS THAT 
ARE TOGETHER JUST 
BELOW THE PINK AND PLAY THOSE BEEN 
WITH CHECK SIDE PLAY THOSE THIN 
WITH CHECK SIDE 
THE PLAYERS' VIEW 
FROM HAWK EYE HE'S PLAYING THE 
SHOT WILLIE CALLED WELL NOT 
REALLY HE SAID CHECK SIDE BUT HE 
PLAYED THAT WITH RUNNING SIDE BUT 
THE SAME SHOT 
WELL HE WILL TAKE THAT GOOD POT 
MIND HE WASN'T CERTAIN TO GET A 
TRACK BACK CLEAN GOOD CHRIS 
KISS ON THE GREEN HE SECOND CHANCE 
IN THIS FRAME HE NEEDS TO GET 
MOVING HIS SECOND CHANCE 
HE HAS DEVELOPED AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
WIN THE FRAME NOW HE IS ONLY FIVE 
POINTS BEHIND HE HAS FOUR DEFINITE 
EASY REDS WHICH SHOULD PUT HIM THIRTY SIX 
IN FRONT DEPENDING ON WHAT COLOUR 
HE TAKES HE NEEDS ONE OR TWO OF 
THE DIFFICULT ONES JUST LOST THE 
CUE BALL LITTLE BIT HE CAN HOLD IT THOUGH 
THIS COULD SETTLE JOE PERRY DOWN 
ROUND BECAUSE HE IS WELL BELOW PAR 
UP TO THIS STAGE SETTLED JOE 
PERRY DOWN NOW 
LUCKILY FOR BOTH PLAYERS AT THE 
MOMENT THEY ARE LITTLE BIT OUT OF 
TOUCH AND THE FACT IT IS THREE 
SESSIONS OF COURSE YOU HAVE GOT 
TIME TO GET INTO YOUR RHYTHM 
NEITHER PLAYER APPEARS TO HAVE GOT 
USED TO THE NEW CLOTH 
HE DIDN'T GET BEHIND THE BLACK I 
THINK HE MAY HAVE COVERED THE RED 
AT HIS SECOND OFF THE CUSHION THERE 
THAT IS SECOND OFF THE CUSHION 
THAT WAS A VERY TIGHT ANGLE WELL 
DONE THAT WAS A MORE DIFFICULT POT 
AND THE ONE HE MISSED ON HIS 
PREVIOUS VISIT IN THE CENTRE THE 
THAN THE ONE THAT IS THE FIRST 
KICK WE HAVE HAD SO FAR L. DON'T 
THINK THE NEW CLOTH AND CUSHIONS 
STOPS THE KICKS WILLIE 
YES WE 
WILL FIND OUT ONE DAY WON'T WE WE 
HAVE HAD ALL SORTS OF PROFESSORS ON 
THE JOB TRYING TO SORT IT OUT SOME 
SAY IT IS 
THE OR IN SOME 
SAY IT IS THE REFEREE'S GLOVES 
SOME SAY IT IS STATIC ELECTRICITY 
WE GET LETTERS IN ALL THE TIME 
THEY ARE ALL LOOKED AT WE USED TO 
PLAY WITH A SLIGHTLY THICKER CLOTH 
YEARS AGO AND TO BE PERFECTLY 
HONEST WE GOT VERY FEW KICKS AND 
IT WAS SLIGHTLY HEAVIER BALL AS 
WELL VERY EASY TO SCREW BACK NOW 
WITH THESE BALLS MAYBE THE THIN 
CLOTH AND THE LIGHT BALLS ARE ONE 
OF THE REASONS 
I THOUGHT FOR A SECOND HE SLIGHTLY 
OVER RUN IT BUT HE IS O. K. 
I THINK ON REFLECTION ONE TO ONE IS FAIR 
NEITHER PLAYER HAS FOUND THEIR TRUE 
FORM BINGHAM HAS HAD BREAKS OF FORTY FIVE 
AND THIRTY FIVE SO BINGHAM WILL BE THE MOST 
DISAPPOINTED AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO JOE PERRY WILL 
HAVE WILL BE PLEASED TO HAVE WON 
ONE OF THE OPENING TWO AT TWO TO TWO 
JOE PERRY IS A LITTLE BIT ANNOYED 
WITH HIMSELF THIS MORNING BOTH 
PLAYERS WILL IMPROVE IT IS ONE TO ONE 
WELL ONE EACH SO BOTH PLAYERS 
WOULD HAVE SETTLED A BIT AND I'M 
SURE THE QUALITY OF PLAY WILL GET 
BETTER AS WE GO ALONG 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT SHOT 
TOUCHING BALL 
A GOOD EFFORT THAT HE KNEW THE 
BLACK SPOT WAS COVERED BY THE RED 
AND HE TOOK A RISK AND IT WAS A 
RISK MOVING THE RED OFF THE SPOT 
HE WENT ALL OUT TO TRY 
AND SCORE 
HEAVILY 
AND HE 
IS A 
LITTLE UNLUCKY 
AN EASY SAFETY SHOT THOUGH 
TOOGOOD POTS HE ONE FROM BINGHAM 
AND THIS ONE FROM JOE PERRY TWO 
GOOD POTS HERE STILL LOT TO DO 
HERE THOUGH THE PINK IS AVAILABLE 
IN ONE OR TWO POCKETS THAT LOOKS 
PRETTY TIGHT 
WELL HE MAY HAVE AN ANGLE HERE TO 
STAY ON THE BLACK BRING IT INTO 
PLAY IF HE WANTS SORRY HE IS TOO 
STRAIGHT LIMITED NOW 
THAT WAS WELL CONTROLLED HAS HE 
GOT ANY ANGLE AT ALL ON THIS PINK 
HE HAD ENOUGH TO PLAY FOR ONE RED 
AT LEAST IF THE PINK GOES BACK ON 
ITS SPOT WHICH I THINK IT DOES 
HE PLAYED FOR THE BAULK COLOURS 
WHICH GAVE HIM BETTER ANGLE BUT A MORE DIFFICULT SHOT 
HE HAD A MASSIVE TARGET AND TO BE 
HONEST THAT IS A POOR SHOT HE HAD 
ABOUT A FOOT GAP HE WILL BE VERY 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT BEING A NEW 
CLOTH IT MAY HAVE SKIDDED MORE 
THAN HE EXPECTED 
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT SHOT IS IF 
YOU HIT IT SLIGHTLY TOO HARD THE 
SPIN DOESN'T TAKE PLACE AND THAT 
SEEMED TO HAPPEN WITH JOE PERRY 
BUT A BIG TARGET AS WILLIE SAID 
PORSCHE A POOR SAFETY SHOT TO FOLLOW 
NOT TOO MUCH DANGER COMING OFF AT 
ONE CUSHION THERE IS BIG BUFFER THERE TO STOP THE CUE BALL 
THAT IS A MUCH BETTER SAFETY SHOT 
FROM STUART BINGHAM JOE PERRY 
CAN'T GET TO THE EDGE OF THE REDS 
MAYBE SNOOKERED THINK HE CAN SEE 
THE REDS TO THE RIGHT OF THE PINK 
BUT I DON'T THINK HE CAN HIT THEM 
IN THE RIGHT SPOT POSSIBLY TO PLAY 
SAFE 
YOU CAN SEE HIM SWERVING HERE HE 
TRIED TO CLIP THE RED ON THE 
OUTSIDE OF THE PACK HE CAUGHT THE 
ONE OFF THE BACK CUSHION AND WAS 
VERY FORTUNATE WHERE THE RED STOP 
HE COULD HAVE OPENED THEM OUT THERE 
WELL PLAYED 
A VERY GOOD POT THAT I'M SURE 
THAT POCKET WOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT 
BLACK AT THAT PACE BEFORE THEY 
CHANGED THE CLOCK CLOTH NOT THAT 
THAT IS BAD THING 
HE HAD TO 
FORCE AN ANGLE THERE TO COME OUT 
INTO OPEN PLAY L. THINK HE CAN PLAY 
THIS SLOW ENOUGH HE CAN KISS IT 
THIN THAT HAS OPENED THINGS UP 
MADE A FORTY FIVE IN THE FIRST FRAME THIRTY FIVE IN 
THE SECOND WHICH HE WENT ON TO 
LOSE AND ONE GOOD KISS HERE AND 
THIS WOULD BE GOOD CHANCE 
LOOKING AT THOSE REDS I DON'T 
THINK THERE ARE ANY OF THESE PLANTS 
ON SO IT IS OFF THE BOTTOM CUSHION 
INTO THE PACK WELL THERE MUST BE 
A PLANT THERE HE PLAYED THREE 
BALL PLANT IN THE FIRST FRAME AND 
MISSED IT L. CAN'T BELIEVE HE HAS 
PLAYED FOR THE SINGLE RED THERE IS 
NO GAP THERE AT ALL THE ONE TO THE 
LEFT I'M 
HAVE 
THOUGHT THEY 
WOULD BE A 
FEW MORE REDS COMING 
INTO PLAY IN PLAYING THAT PLANT 
AND HE HASN'T REALLY MOVED ANYTHING 
FOR SOMEBODY OF STUART'S CLASS WHEN 
YOU ONLY HAVE FIVE OR SIX REDS TO 
GO INTO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO 
KNOCK ONE OF THEM INTO PLAY WAS NOT ONE OF HIS BEST 
WELL HE HAS KISSED THE YELLOW SAFE 
SO THAT WILL HELP HIM HE IS TWENTY SIX 
POINTS IN FRONT HE WOULD HAVE 
LIKED TO HAVE WON THE FRAME AT THAT 
VISIT HE WAS A LITTLE UNLUCKY WHEN 
HE PLAYED THE PLANT NOT TO OPEN FEW REDS OUT 
WELL I DON'T THINK I HAVE SEEN JOE 
PERRY PLAY THIS BADLY IN THE SAFETY 
DEPARTMENT MUST HAVE HE IS 
EXCELLENT NORMALLY IN THE SAFETY 
DEPARTMENT 
WELL ANOTHER ERROR IN THE SAFETY 
DEPARTMENT FOR JOE PERRY ONCE HE 
STARTS TO MAKE ERRORS OUT THERE 
UNFORCED ERRORS I MIGHT ADD YOU 
ALWAYS LEAVE YOUR OPPONENT PUT 
SOMETHING EASY TO GO AT 
HE WILL 
HAVE AN ANGLE HERE ON THE BLUE TO 
GO INTO THEM BUT THAT IS NOT A 
SHOT HE WILL WANT TO GET 
RID OF 
THE BLACK ON THE RED SPOT THERE IS 
A CHANCE HE MIGHT NOT KNOCK A RED 
IN 
IF HE IS CONFIDENT ENOUGH HERE TO 
SCREW INTO THE BUNCH IT IS WORTH A 
RISK 
THAT IS WHAT HE HAS PLAYED HE 
DESERVES TO WIN THE FRAME NOW WHEN 
YOU PLAY THE RIGHT SHOT AND YOU 
DEVELOP BALLS INTO PLAY YOU 
DESERVE A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK HE 
HAS PLAYED THAT NICELY THERE ARE 
AT LEAST TWO REDS AVAILABLE TWO 
REDS TOOK A MISS CALLED TO HAPPEN 
ONE TWO COMERS FORTY TWO TO ONE TWO KYLE FOR TWO TO ONE COLOURS 
HE IS STRUGGLING A BIT WITH THE 
WHITE BALL 
TOO GOOD FOR AVAILABLE HERE BUT HE 
WOULD LIKE TO BE RIGHT BEHIND THEM 
TWO RED THE RED WILL BE ENOUGH HE 
DOES NOT NEED TO DO TOO MUCH 
HE DID NOT MESS ABOUT THERE HE 
PLAYED FOR THE BLACK KISSED HER 
RED AND GOT IT INTO PLAY THE RED 
HE STRIKE THE BALL VERY NICELY 
STUART WHEN HE GETS MOVING 
STRIKES A SLIGHTLY UNORTHODOX CUE 
ACTION AS LONG AS IT WORKS FOR HIM 
THERE JOE HAS PLENTY TO THINK 
ABOUT HERE 
NOW BUT TRICK SHOT DOES NOT WORK 
OUT THAT CLOSING FORTY THREE IS ENOUGH TO 
TAKE STUART BINGHAM ONE FRAME IN 
FRONT HE LEADS TWO TO ONE 
LAST FRAME BEFORE THE FIRST 
INTERVAL IN THIS MATCH THERE ARE 
EIGHT FRAMES IN EACH SESSION A 
BREAK AFTER FOUR STUART BINGHAM IS 
SCORING QUITE NICELY BUT NOT 
WINNING A FRAME AT ONE VISIT HE IS 
NEEDING TWO AND THREE CHANCES TO 
WIN THE FRAME 
AND THAT IS BETTER CHAIR THAT IS 
BETTER JOE IT IS ONE OF THESE 
SESSIONS WHEN NEITHER PLAYER IS AT 
HIS BEST A LOT OF UNFORCED ERRORS 
FROM BOTH PLAYERS A PUT PART OF 
THAT DOWN TO THE TABLE BEING 
DIFFERENT WITH IT HAVING A NEW 
CLOTH I PUT PART OF THAT SPINS 
WOULD BE A BIT EASIER TO GET ON 
YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO THAT AND 
THE THROW OFF THE CUSHIONS 
I THINK IF EITHER PLAYER COMES AT 
HERE WELL BINGHAM IS THE ONE WHO 
COULD TAKE THE LEAD PERRY COULD 
ONLY DRAW INTO THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL IF BEING DOES GO THREE TO ONE 
PERRY WILL BE DEVASTATED GIVEN THE 
WAY HE HAS PLAYED 
WELL THE RED IS OBSCURING THE 
OTHER RED HE MAY HAVE TO PLAY THE 
LONG PLANT IF HE HAD TO PLAY ONE 
ON TO THE OTHER HE WILL HAVE TO 
TRY AND POT THE RED HE IS GOING FOR 
IT MAY BE A SWERVE AND THEN THE 
CUSHION FIRST FROM THAT PICTURE 
IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE HE CAN GET 
ROUND THE BACK OF THE RED BUT 
LOOKING AT THAT PICTURE I THINK A 
LITTLE BIT OF RIGHT HAND SIDE SET 
FOR A KING SWERVE HE NEEDED TO CLEAR UP UNLUCKY 
WELL HE HAS GOT THE SNOOKER BEHIND 
THE BLACK HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED 
TO HAVE POTTED STRAIGHT FORWARD 
THIS ONE UP BECAUSE THE WAY YOU 
THE BALLS WILL SET WELL THE PACK 
AT THIS STAGE IS NORMALLY PRETTY 
TIGHT YOU CAN DROP OFF ONE CUSHION 
INTO THE REDS BUT THEY ARE ALL 
OVER THE PLACE AT THE MOMENT 
WELL WHAT HAPPENED THEN I THOUGHT 
HE WAS GOING TO TRY AND PULL UP ON 
FACT THAT 
STEW IT SITS AND LOOKS AT WHAT THE 
DAMAGE IS STUART ORAM NOT SURE 
WHAT HE PLAYED THERE HE MUST HAVE 
HAD HIS OWN IDEA OF SKIMMING OFF RED SOMEHOW 
AS WE CAN SEE HE OBVIOUSLY 
MISJUDGED IT POORLY 
JOE PERRY IS ABLE TO GENERATE OR 
MAKE THINGS HAPPEN WHEN HE IS NOT 
PLAYING AT HIS BEST AND WHEN HE IS 
PLAYING AT HIS BEST HE IS A MATCH 
FOR ANYBODY BINGHAM MAY HAVE 
MISSED A CHANCE FOR GETTING A 
SIZEABLE LEAD IN THIS MATCH YOU YOU WERE A BIT HARD ON HIM THINK HE 
HAD CHANCES IN THE FIRST THREE 
TOUR SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT SO I 
SUPPOSE YOU ARE RIGHT 
OBVIOUSLY THE PINK GOES CAN HE 
GET THROUGH TO IT HE IS HAVING A 
LOOK DOWN HE IS O. K. THIS IS HIS 
SECOND LOOK IT LOOKS OF HE WOULD 
HE MR. BEEN UP BUT AS HE COULDN'T 
HE HAS IT THAT TO YOU HAVE THERE 
WAS A BIT OF THAT ON IT IT LOOKS 
AS IF HE IS O. K. BUT WHEN HE BENDS 
DOWN THERE 
IS A BIT OF DOUBT IS LOOKING DOWN AT IT AGAIN THERE IS A RED AVAILABLE INTO THE RIGHT 
CENTRE HE BEEN LOOKING AT THE 
ANGLE HE HAS CAUGHT UP TO IT TAKING 
ON THIS RED IF HE GO NOT GOOD 
THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT SHOT THE 
BEST POSITIONAL SHOT WE HAVE SEEN 
SO FAR IN THIS MATCH 
HE SCREWED BACK INTO THE RED 
PURPOSEFULLY TO HIT IT FULL ON 
OFF THE SIDE CUSHION AND ON TO THE 
BLACK YOU ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A 
COLOUR THE ONLY WAY 
IT IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE 
COMPLICATED NOW FOR JOE THE SPIDER 
IS COMING OUT NOW HE IS O. K. HE CAN 
JUST GET PAST IT 
HE DID NOT WANT TO CATCH THE RED 
THERE 
HE DIDN'T GET A BOUNCE OFF THE 
CUSHION 
THERE IS A BETTER SAFETY SHOT HE 
PLAYED IT REALLY WELL 
NOTHING NICE TO GET BACK INTO BAULK 
THE YELLOW IS IN THE WAY HAS HE 
SPOTTED ONE THAT WILL PUT IN BY THE 
BLACK HE CERTAINLY PLAYED IT BUT 
ONCE AGAIN THIS SHOT TO NOTHING 
SAFETY IS NOT GOOD POPPED IN 
WE WOULD NORMALLY BE SAYING HE 
SHOULD CLINCH IT FROM HERE BUT THE 
WAY THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING THERE 
ARE NO CERTAINTIES L. MUST SAY 
THOUGH JOE PERRY WOULD BE 
DEVASTATED IF HE DID NOT WIN THE 
FRAME THIS IS AS GOOD A CHILD'S AS 
HE IS GOING TO GET A CHANCE AS 
HE HAS COME A TO GET THIS TO A 
CHANCE AS HE IS GOING TO GET 
I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT WAS 
HIGH BUT JOE'S SEEM TO THINK IT 
WENT UP THE TABLE JOE SEEMED 
THE PREVIOUS SHOT WAS ALWAYS 
HITTING THE TOP JAW HE WILL BE 
RELIEVED TO SEE THAT GOING HE IS 
FORTY NINE IN FRONT NOW 
WELL THE RED HAS NOT DISAPPEARED 
SO BARRING SNOOKERS JOE PERRY WILL 
HAVE LEVET AT TO HAPPEN TO YOU 
LEVELLED LEVELLED AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO BOTH BOTH PLAYERS USE THAT FIFTEEN MINUTE INTERVAL 
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 
FIRST FOUR FRAMES LEVELLED AT TWO 
TWO 
I CAN SEE TWO REDS ON THE RIGHT 
HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE HE MAY OPT 
TO GO INTO THE SIDE OF THE PACK 
PAST THE BROWN IF HE GOT THE ANGLE 
HE HAS TAKEN THE CORRECT SAFETY ON 
THAT WAS A TOUGH SHOT TO PLAY IT 
IS AN ERROR NOT THE FIRST WE HAVE 
SEEN FROM JOE PERRY'S SAFETY SO 
RELIABLE NORMALLY IN THAT 
DEPARTMENT HE HAD TO AVOID THAT 
RED IT WAS A BIG TARGET 
THESE SHOW IT'S A GREAT WHEN YOU 
ARE PLAYING A LITTLE NUDGE ON RED 
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T PUSH THEM 
STRAIGHT THESE SHOTS ARE GREAT 
REALLY GOOD BREAK BUILDER STUART 
BINGHAM HE HAS BEEN PROFESSIONAL 
FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND IT'S BEEN A 
MYSTERY WHY HE HAS NEVER GOT TO THE 
TOP SIXTEEN IN THE BALLS HE IS A MATCH 
FOR ALMOST YES HE TURNED PROFESSIONAL IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
THE OLD CLOCK TICKS BY WILLIE AS 
YOU GET A FEW YEARS OLDER 
YES AND 
BATHING YOU CARRY BATTLE SCARS 
SOMETIMES AS HE HAS NEVER GOT TO 
THE TOP SIXTEEN AND HAVE NEVER GOT TO 
THE STAGE SOUND HAS HE GETS A 
LITTLE BIT TOO EXCITED WE HAVE 
SEEN HIM BEAT HENDRY HERE WHEN 
HENDRY WAS AT HIS BEST HE IS A 
MATCH FOR BOTH PLAYERS IF HE COULD 
GET ALL HIS GAME RIGHT HE COULD 
A REGULAR 
TOP SIXTEEN PLAYER FOR YEARS 
I REMEMBER HIM MISSING A GOOD 
CHANCE FOR MAXIMUM IN TO PERSON AND TOOK STOCK TWO THOUSAND TWO 
THAT SHOT YESTERDAY IT WOULD NOT 
HAVE MEANT HE WOULD BE ON A RED IT 
IS DEFINITELY RUNNING SLOW THIS 
CLOTH THAN IN PREVIOUS DAYS 
HE NEEDS AN ANGLE HE HAS GOT IT ON THE YELLOW HE DID 
NOT HAVE LOT OF ANGLE THAT WAS A VERY GOOD SHOT 
I MENTIONED IN THE LAST FRAME THAT 
THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN A FEW BREAKS 
OVER FORTY THIS IS THE SIX BREAK OVER 
FORTY THIS IS AN EXCELLENT CHANCE TO 
WIN AT ONE WITH IT ONE VISIT 
OF COURSE STUART BINGHAM BEAT THE 
ONE AND ONLY MR. DAVIS IN THE FIRST 
ROUND HE BEAT HIM TEN AND EIGHT HE 
WAS WELL IN FRONT IN THAT MATCH 
WHEN STEVE CAME BACK VERY STRONGLY 
AND MISSED CHANCE TO GO NINE TO EIGHT BINGHAM CLOSED THE GAME UP TO TEN TO EIGHT 
HE HAS OVER DOWN THAT A LITTLE BIT 
AND ONLY RED ARE AVAILABLE IS THE 
ONE AT THE BACK OF THE PACK INTO 
THE LEFT HAND CORNER 
THE THE 
ONLY RED AVAILABLE BUT HE MIGHT 
NOT END UPON ANYTHING THE KEY PART 
OF THAT SURE WAS HE HAD TO TAKE THE 
MIDDLE ONE OF THE THREE YEARS WERE 
TO MOVE IT OUT 
OF THE 
WAVE HE 
TO MOVE IT OUT OF THE WAVE HE PLAYED IT PERFECTLY THERE SHOULD 
BE A FRAME WINNER THAT SHOULD BE 
WILLIE MENTIONED EARLIER NOBODY 
HAS WON FRAME IN ONE VISIT IT IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN HERE BY A LOOK OF 
IT THAT IS ENOUGH SEVENTY FOUR IN FRONT 
JUST SIXTY SEVEN LEFT HE IS STILL IN GOOD 
POSITION OF 
YES RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
HOLD THE HIGHEST BREAK A BREAK OF 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY WHOLENESS HE HOLDS 
YES YOU WOULD NOT EXPECT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO TO BE 
LEADING SO DEEP INTO THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP UNTIL THAT ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE TO SEE A 
MAXIMUM BUT ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE OR ABOVE YOU WOULD 
CERTAINLY EXPECT TO WIN THE BREAK 
PRIZE SO ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE HE IS TOUCH AND GO 
IF HE DOES MAKE THREE REDS AND 
THREE BLACKS TEN THOUSAND WITH THE HIGH 
BREAK SO IT IS WORTH GOING FOR 
JUST HAS TO BE A LITTLE CAREFUL 
HERE 
THAT IS UNLUCKY HE CONCENTRATED SO 
HARD IT JUST FLICKED THE FIRST RED 
TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF PACE OUT OF IT 
TOUCHING BALL L. L. DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN POT A BALL ALMOST 
STILL THE HIGHEST BREAK IN THE 
MATCH SO FAR THAT NINETY EIGHT FROM STUART 
BINGHAM HE IS THREE TO TWO IN FRONT 
THE PLAYER WHO HAS BROKEN OFF HAS 
WON THE FRAME EACH TIME THAT 
PATTERN WILL BREAK AT SOME POINT IN 
THE MATCH 
BINGHAM IS LOOKING A LITTLE MORE 
CONFIDENT HERE NOW WHAT EVER YOU 
DO OUT THERE YOU NEED TO GET A 
GOOD BREAK BEFORE YOU CAN FEEL ONE HUNDRED 
PER CENT CONFIDENT AND GETTING FORTIES AND 
FIFTIES AND BREAKING DOWN IS NOT QUITE 
THE SAME EVEN IF YOU WIN THE FRAME 
AS MY CO COMMENTATOR OFTEN REMINDS 
US COMING HAVE GOT TO SCORE IN THE 
PROFESSIONAL GAME TO BE A WINNER 
THESE DAYS THAT IS WHAT ALL THE 
PLAYERS STRIVE FOR 
WE WILL KNOW 
AFTER THE SHOT WHETHER THE BLACK 
POTS OR NOT 
STUART DOESN'T CUE POWER LIKE A LOT 
OF PLAYERS DO SOMETIMES HE DOES 
NOT GET THROUGH THE BALL AS WELL AS 
MOST HE DOES THAT LOT GET THE 
WRONG SIDE OF THE BLUE HE NEEDS 
THAT TO SLOW UP 
ONE OF 
THAT TO SLOW UP ONE OF YOURS WILLIE 
HE PLAYED FOR THE OUTSIDE RED TO 
THE RIGHT OF THE SCREEN AS OUR 
REFEREE PETER WILLIAM SON CLEANS 
HE IS CLEANING THE RED THERE FOR 
SOME REASON WHY HE HAS BEEN ASKED 
TO CLEAN THAT I DON'T KNOW UNLESS 
HE CLEANED THE BLACK AS WELL 
ANYWAY STUART BINGHAM HAS HAD A 
LOOK TO SEE IF THE BLACK WOULD GO 
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING YOU 
COULDN'T SEE PAST THE REFEREE 
THERE ARE NOT MANY ONE HUNDRED BREAKS THAT 
STUART PLACE WHERE IT DOESN'T GO IN 
AND OUT OF BAULK A FEW TIMES 
HE HAS THE PERFECT ANGLE TO PLAY 
INTO THE RED AND BLACK AT THE SAME 
TIME IF HE CAN HIT THE JOINT OF 
THE RED AND BLACK AND PUSH THE 
BLACK TOWARDS THE CORNER THE 
CANNON ON THE RED WILL FREE THE 
BLACK SPOT 
IF HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON A RED HERE 
JOE PERRY WOULD HAVE BEEN ASKING 
THE REFEREE WHAT IS GOING ON HERE 
PLAYED TO SCREW INTO THE PACK 
DIRECTLY JUST GOT THE BLUE I I THINK HE CAN GET THROUGH TO THE 
POTTING ANGLE FOR THIS RED HE HAS 
PLAYED TO SCREW DIRECTLY INTO THE 
PACK 
THAT IS THE SECOND FLICK HE PACK HAD A FLICK EARLIER ON WHEN HE 
DIDN'T PLAY FOR THE RED AND GOT ON 
IT ALL THESE THINGS TEND TO AFFECT 
YOU WHEN YOU ARE IN THE CHAIR THEY 
GIVE YOU A LITTLE NUDGE MENTALLY 
LOOKS A LOT MORE AGGRESSIVE HE HAS 
PROBABLY BEEN IN THE DRESSING ROOM 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE HAS 
PRACTISED DURING THE INTERVAL BUT 
HE HAS COME AT A DIFFERENT PLAYER 
I THINK YOU REALISE THAT JOE HADN'T 
PLAYED AT HIS BEST IN THE FIRST 
FOUR JOE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MORE 
PLEASED OF THE TWO AT TWO AT TWO BUT 
BINGHAM HAS COME OUT AND LOOKED 
REAL THREAT 
JOE PERRY IN HIS CHAIR 
LOOKS AS IF HE IS NOT VERY HAPPY AT 
ALL NOT A GOOD POSTURE THAT HE 
SHOULD BE UP STRAIGHT LOOKING 
POSITIVE 
I KNOW YOU TEACH PLAYERS POSITIVE WOULD YOU ASK THEM TO HAVE THEIR 
DEMEANOUR RIGHT IN THE CHAIR DO 
YOU THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO SHOW 
YOUR OPPONENT THAT YOU'RE NOT FED 
UP 
I THINK SO WHAT IS THE BENEFIT UP OF IT L. ALWAYS ASK THE SAME 
QUESTION APART FROM TAKING ALL 
YOUR WEIGHT ON TO ONE SIDE AND YOUR 
HAND HOLDING YOUR CHIN UP IT IS 
NOT GREAT 
I THINK SOMETIMES YOU 
CAN MAKE YOUR OPPONENT FEEL WORRIED 
ABOUT YOU BECAUSE YOU LOOK SO CALM 
AND CONFIDENT JOE SITTING IN HIS 
CHAIR DOESN'T LOOK AS IF HE FANCIES 
THE JOB AT THE MOMENT OBVIOUSLY IT 
IS ONLY THE FIRST FEW FRAMES OF THE 
FIRST SESSION 
A FEW EDGES HAVE 
GONE AGAINST HIM L. CAN UNDERSTAND 
HOW HE FEELS INSIDE BUT HE 
SHOULDN'T BE SHOWING THAT PETER 
EBDON IS THE BEST EXAMPLE YOU 
WATCH HIM WHEN HE IS SITTING OUT 
WHICH YOU HAVE TO DO FOR LONG 
PERIODS HERE IN THE CRUCIBLE NO 
MATTER WHO YOU ARE THE WAY HE SITS 
AND LOOKS AND GLARES AND HE SITS 
UPRIGHT IT GIVES YOU MORE POSITIVE 
THOUGHTS WHEN YOU CHANCE COMES 
ALONG YOU ARE READY FOR IT WHEN 
YOUR CHANCE COMES ALONG 
THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT UNLUCKY 
WASN'T IT HE IS PLAYING TO KISS 
EITHER RED THAT IS IN FRONT OF THE 
BLACK ANY SORT OF CANNON IS GOOD 
AND HE HAS FOUND THE GAP SO HE HAS 
BEEN A BIT UNFORTUNATE IN THIS 
BREAK SO FAR MAYBE HIS LUCK WAS 
DUE TO RUN OUT A LITTLE BIT 
THOSE TWO REDS ABOVE THE BLACK HE 
IS HAVING A LOOK NOW IT LOOKS AS 
IF THERE MAY BE POSSIBILITY OF A 
PLANT HE'S NOT PLAYING THEM DIRECT 
ANYWAY 
THAT MAY HAVE LOOKED LIKE A POOR 
SAFETY BUT HE HAD TO PLAY IT WITH 
THAT AMOUNT OF PACE AND A THIN 
CONTACT WAS NEEDED NOT TO DISTURB 
THE REDS BY THE BLACK 
AS SOON AS HE CAN SEE THAT RED NEXT 
TO THE BACK HE WILL PLAY THAT 
SAFETY SHOT THAT IS THE BEST 
SAFETY SHOT HE HAS PLAYED FOR SOME 
TIME 
HOW HAS IT GONE IN OFF AT THAT 
ANGLE THAT IS AMAZING L. DON'T 
THINK I HAVE SEEN A BALL GO IN THE 
POCKET AT THIS SPEED THAT IS 
AMAZING AT THAT SPEED INCREDIBLE 
AND STUART BINGHAM WAS SHAKING HIS 
HEAD AS HE WENT BACK TO HIS CHAIR 
EVEN THOUGH HE IS THIRTY SIX POINTS BEHIND 
THE BALLS ARE NOW PERFECT WHAT 
CHANCE THIS IS TO PINCH FRAME THAT WILL HURT 
HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO HAVE GOT 
THE RED CLOSEST TO THE BLACK 
HE WAS THIRTY SEVEN POINTS BEHIND WHEN HE 
CAME TO THE TABLE AS WILLIE 
MENTIONED THEY COULDN'T BE IN A 
MUCH BETTER POSITION THERE IS ONE 
DOWN ON THE BOTTOM CUSHION HERE 
THE PLAYERS DON'T MIND THAT IT IS 
WHEN THEY ARE ON THE SIDE CUSHION 
OR ON THE BAULK CUSHION DOWN BEHIND 
THE BALL COLOURS THOSE ARE THE 
PROBLEM ONES STILL HAVE TO BE DONE 
IT IS FUNNY SOMETIMES THE LAST FORTY 
OF FIFTY POINTS IN A FRAME ARE LOT 
EASIER THAN THE FIRST FORTY OR FIFTY 
BINGHAM MADE A BREAK OF FORTY ONE TO GET 
THIS LEAD BUT WITH THAT ABOUT OF 
BALLS DISAPPEARED THE NEXT FORTY OR 
FIFTY IS USUALLY LITTLE BIT EASIER 
THIS IS PRIME EXAMPLE HERE HE'S 
ONLY ON THIRTY EIGHT AT THE MINUTE BUT HE HAS 
NOT HAD TO WORK QUITE AS HARD AS 
STUART DID EARLIER ON THAT IS WHY 
YOU HAVE TO TRY TO GET SEVENTY FOUR REBUFF 
WHEN YOU ARE IN AMONG THE BALLS 
SEVENTY FOUR OR ABOVE 
THIS IS THE KEY SHOT DIDN'T WANT 
TO FINISH STRAIGHT HE HASN'T 
FINISHED STRAIGHT 
YOU CAN MISS ANYTHING IF YOU HIT 
THE NEAR JAW YOU HAVE TO PLAY OFF 
THE FAR JAW WHEN YOU PLAY THOSE 
SHOTS HE COULD HAVE PLAYED THAT TO 
ROLL IT IN 
STUART HAS BEEN A BIT CARELESS 
THERE THAT WAS DREADFUL SHOT HE 
HAD BETTER HOPE THAT HE CAN SEE THE 
GREEN 
HE PLAYED THAT NICELY HE PLAYED 
WITH LOT OF CHECK SIDE TO SLOW 
THE WHITE DOWN AND MAKE SURE THE 
BLUE WOULD 
NOT BE 
HAMPERING HIM FOR 
THE GREEN THEY ARE TOUGH SHOT TO PLAY 
I AM SURE STUART BINGHAM A FEW 
MOMENTS AGO THOUGHT HE HAD MISSED 
THE BOAT IN THIS FRAME WHEN HE 
BROKE DOWN ON FORTY ONE 
TWO POINTS IN FRONT MEANS HE ONLY 
NEEDS THIS PINK AND ANOTHER FRAME 
JOE COULD HAVE WON THAT HE HAS LOST 
STUART BINGHAM WILL BE DELIGHTED 
NOW THEN CAN STUART BINGHAM PUSH 
ON FROM HERE FOUR TO TWO IN FRONT SO IT A 
GAP APPEARED FOR THE FIRST TIME 
ALSO LOOKED AS IF HE WAS GOING TO 
LOSE THAT PREVIOUS FRAME HAS JOE 
PERRY GOT ANY ANSWERS HE HAS 
EXCELLENT LONG POT 
HE GOT THROUGH A VERY SMALL GAP TO 
GET BACK DOWN TO THE BAULK COLOURS 
GOOD ANGLE ON THE BLUE BLACK IS IN 
THE OPEN 
I AM NOT SURE WHERE THEY HE HAD A 
BAD CONTACT OR NOT BUT HE SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN 
AT LEAST 
THREE 
OR FOUR 
INCHES NEARER TO THIS RED SHOULD 
STILL GET IT BUT IT DOES RESTRICT 
YOUR POSITION IF YOU PUT ANY SPINS 
ON 
JOE PERRY WILL BE VERY WELL AWARE 
THAT HE HAS GOT TO RESPOND NOW TO 
THAT TWO FRAME DEFICIT HE IS FACING 
AT THE MOMENT 
TERRY MENTIONED IN COMMENTARY 
THESE TWO PLAYERS HAVE PLAYED EACH 
OTHER TWICE AND JOE PERRY HAS WON 
BOTH OF THE MATCHES ALBEIT ONE WAS 
VERY CLOSE THAT IS ALWAYS IN YOUR 
MIND WHEN YOU HAVE AN OPPONENT THAT 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT A GOOD RECORD 
AGAINST SOME PLAYERS YOU FEEL YOU 
CAN BEAT THEM EVERY TIME YOU PLAY 
THEM OTHERS WHEN YOU HAVEN'T GOT 
GAME GOOD RECORD IT MAKES IT MORE 
DIFFICULT STUART BINGHAM WILL HAVE 
THAT IN THE BACK OF HIS MIND THERE THERE IS STILL A LONG WAY TO GO IN THIS 
MATCH BUT JOE PERRY LOST THE NEXT 
TWO FRAMES AND SHOULD HE GO SIX TO TWO 
BEHIND YOU WOULD NOT PUT A LOT OF 
MONEY ON HIM 
HE TRIED TO SCREW PAST THE PINK AND 
THEN THE WHITE TO TRY TO PUSH INTO 
THE SIDE OF THE BUNCH HE JUST 
FLICKED THE PINK ON THE WAY UP 
WHICH MEANT THE BACK SPIN HAD 
DISAPPEARED WHENEVER IT HITS 
ANOTHER BALL IT TAKES LOADS OF 
SPIN OFF IT 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS IN THE CUP OF 
TEA AT HALF TIME BUT BOTH PLAYERS 
APPEARED TO HAVE SETTLED AND LOOK 
LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO SCORE 
HEAVILY WHEN THEY GET IN THE FIRST 
FOUR FRAMES THEY LOOKED TENTATIVE 
PERHAPS IT WAS A BIT MORE THAN A 
CUP OF TEA WILLIE COFFEE MAYBE 
NOBODY LIKES TO SEE THEM STRUGGLING 
OUT THERE WHICH THEY DID BEFORE 
THE INTERVAL 
IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A TOUGH 
MATCH TO CALL THIS ONE I'M NOT 
SURE WHAT THE ODDS WERE AT THE 
START 
THEY MADE JOE PERRY START FAVOURITE DO THINK RIGHTLY SO ON 
EXPERIENCE ALONE AND THE FACT THAT 
HE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT 
OF THE 
TOP 
SIXTEEN AND A MORE REGULAR MATCH WINNER 
BINGHAM WAS ELEVEN TO EIGHT AGAINST IN ONE 
PLACE AT THAT PRICE I WOULD HAVE 
DEFINITELY FAVOURED BINGHAM 
YOU NORMALLY GET THEM RIGHT WILLIE 
WITH THE RESULTS THIS WEEK I DON'T 
THINK I HAVE BACKED A WINNER WE 
KNOW RYAN DAY IS A GREAT PLAYER 
DID WE EXPECTING TO BEAT HIGGINS 
MAYBE WE KNOW ALI CARTER IS A 
GREAT PLAYER DID WE EXPECT HIM TO 
BEAT MURPHY MAYBE 
I THINK THERE 
WERE FIVE OR SIX HE'S LOST IN THE 
FIRST ROUND TOP SIXTEEN SEEDS FIVE 
OR SIX SEEDS L. THINK THE GREEN WAS 
IN HIS MIND THERE HE WAS TRYING TO 
FIND A WAY TO PUT A TOUCH OF STUN 
ON TO AVOID THE GREEN 
SO FIFTY TWO WHICH HIS HIGHEST BREAK SO 
FAR NO WE HAVE DONE A FIFTY THREE IN THE 
PREVIOUS ROUND SORRY HE IS NOT 
SCORING AS BINGHAM DID IN ONE FRAME 
NINETY EIGHT IT IS THE ONLY FRAME WE HAD 
JOE'S BODY LANGUAGE IS NOT HAD GOOD IN THIS MATCH WHOEVER IS WITH 
HIM I WOULD SUGGEST THEY ASK HIM 
TO BE A LITTLE MORE INVOLVED IN THE 
GAME HE IS 
LOOKING A 
BIT LIKE A 
FISH OUT OF WATER IN THE GAME AT 
THE 
MOMENT HE'S 
TOO 
GOOD A 
PLAYER 
TO BE LIKE THAT 
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE 
SAYING WILLIE IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S 
HALF EXPECTING SOMETHING TO GO 
WRONG THAT IS HIS DEMEANOUR 
ESPECIALLY IN THE CHAIR PERHAPS 
NOT SO MUCH WHEN HE IS ON THE TABLE 
I THINK IS FAIR TO SAY THERE IS A 
LOT OF PRESSURE ON 
THE LADS 
OUT 
THERE BUT EVEN MORE SO YOU SHOULD 
TRY AND CONTROL IT IN HIS OWN WAY 
HE IS LETTING THE PRESSURE GET TO 
HIM 
BEST SAFETY HE HAS PLAYED TODAY 
NOW THEN LET'S HAVE A SMILE JOE 
STUART CAN GET THROUGH TO THE 
POTTING ANGLE FOR THE ONE ON THE 
PINK SPOT THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE 
HE COULD PLAY THIS AS SHOT TO 
NOTHING NOT GREAT DEAL OF ROOM 
THOUGH IF HE CAN PLAY IT PLAIN 
BALL THE POT AND MISS THE REDS 
AND PINK THINK HE CAN GO ROUND THE 
BACK OF THE TWO REDS THAT ARE TO 
THE LEFT OF THE BLUE 
THAT'S THE ONE I WAS TALKING ABOUT 
THERE IS THE SHOT TO NOTHING GREEN 
IS AVAILABLE IF IT IS NOT STRAIGHT 
GREAT POT 
I WAS JUST THINKING THAT 
JOE PERRY HAD HAD A BIT OF LUCK 
THERE AFTER MISSING THAT LONG POT 
HE TOOK AN EXCELLENT POT FROM 
STUART BINGHAM TO GIVE HIM THIS 
CHANCE HE DIDN'T SEEM TO CATCH 
THAT GREEN VERY WELL HE IS ON THE 
RED IN THE MIDDLE SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO POT IT AND STUN THE CUE BALL OFF 
TWO CUSHIONS DOWN FOR THE BLACK 
YES GOOD CALL THAT IF HE SCREWS 
JUST PASSED THE MIDDLE POCKET 
EXCELLENT CALL FROM TERRY 
EXCELLENT EXECUTION FROM STUART 
BINGHAM WE MENTIONED IN THE LAST 
FRAME WHEN THE FIRST FORTY OR FIFTY 
KIND OF QUITE TOUGH THIS TIME IT 
IS JOE PERRY WHO HAS GOT THE FIRST 
FORTY OR FIFTY AND STUART CAN STUART 
BINGHAM TO HAVE CAN STUART 
BINGHAM COUNTER WITH A CLEARANCE 
IN THE END HE IS VERY FORTUNATE IF 
HE CAN GET TO THE CUE BALL HERE FOR 
THE BROWN L. THINK HE WAS HOLDING 
FOR THE YELLOW AND GREEN HE 
MISTIMED THAT COMPLETELY AS THINGS 
ARE HE'S TAKING HIS TIME HERE SO 
PERHAPS THE CUEING IS AWKWARD YES 
THINK IT IS TIME TO BITE THE BULLET 
HIT TOP UP ON THE YELLOW SO A 
CLEAR CUT CHANCE THERE FOR STUART 
BINGHAM AFTER HE POTTED SUCH AN 
EXCELLENT FIRST RED HE HAS GONE BY 
COMING THIS WAY TELLS ME ONLY ONE 
THING HE PLAYING FOR THE LOOSE 
RED HE IS PLAYING 
THIS IS NOT GUARANTEED I KNOW THIS 
ONE CUSHION LOOKS STRAIGHT FORWARD 
BUT HE WILL BE PLAYING THIS QUITE 
PACE HE PACY A GOOD SHOT HE 
NEEDS LITTLE BIT OF HELP WITH THE 
RED IS THERE A GAP BETWEEN THE RED 
AND BLACK IT WOULD BE UNLUCKY IF 
THERE WAS SURELY NOT 
HE IS HAVING A LOOK AT SOMETHING I I THINK IT POTS TERRY THE RED WILL 
DEFINITELY PAST THE PINK IT IS 
WHETHER HE CAN SEE ENOUGH OF IT TO 
POT IT 
I AM WATCHING JOE IN THE CHAIR HE 
KNOWS THAT RED IS A POSSIBILITY HE 
WILL BE THE KEY HOW UNLUCKY HE IS 
BECAUSE HE HAS DONE A GREAT ESCAPE 
IN THE PREVIOUS SHOT WITH THE 
SNOOKER UNFORTUNATE TO LOSE THE 
FRAME FROM HERE THERE'S A CHANCE 
OF THAT HAPPENING NOW 
WELL IT IS 
JUST THE ONE KISS 
HE JUST HAS WON CANNON TO PLAY AND 
IT IS NOT BOUND TO GO RIGHT HE 
HAS WON CANNON 
HE PLAYED IT NICELY COULD AND 
MAYBE SHOULD WIN THE FRAME NOW 
THIS IS A GREAT CHANCE FOR FIVE TO TWO 
THIS WILL HURT JOE PERRY 
MINE HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL HERE 
BECAUSE THE ANGLE ON THE PINK OR 
BLACK HAS TO BE SUCH THAT IT WILL 
MOVE ON TO THE RED EASILY ONE 
HAS TO BE 
I WONDER WHETHER IT IS WORTH 
PLAYING FOR THE BLACK OR THE PINK 
HERE HE IS ON A CHOICE FOR BOTH 
THE PINK IS THE EASIEST POT OF 
EASTLEIGH OBVIOUSLY 
HE IS O. K. HE IS JUST CHECKING THE 
SCOREBOARD THAT WILL SHOW HIM HE 
MR. OF SIXTEEN POINTS BEHIND HE IS 
STILL SIXTEEN POINTS BEHIND HE PLAYED THAT WELL 
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS GO ON TO THE 
BAULK COLOURS OF THE LAST RED 
UNLESS THERE ARE SOMETHING AWKWARD 
THERE THERE IS ONCE AGAIN HE 
HAS LOST THE CUE BALL AT LIVE A 
BIT NOT ENOUGH TO PUT HIM OUT OF 
POSITION A LITTLE BIT 
HE IS FEELING THE PRESSURE HE WAS 
LOOKING LITTLE UNSETTLED THERE JUST BLUE AND PINK NEEDED 
HE GOT THEM ALL IN THE POCKET HE 
GOES THREE FRAMES IN FRONT 
IS THERE ANYTHING AVAILABLE IN THE 
MIDDLE DO A COUPLE OF KISSES THERE 
NOT TOO SURE WHETHER THE ONE 
NEAREST THE PINK SPOT WILL SPOT 
WILL POT NO IT DOESN'T POT THAT 
ONE TO THE LEFT OF THE PINK SPOT 
IF STUART PLAYS THE POT I WILL 
FALL OVER 
IT IS A TEMPTER FOR JOE THE DUKE 
OF FIVE TO TWO IN FRONT IT IS TRICKY FIVE TO TWO 
BEHIND NOT NINTH IF YOU ARE FIVE TO TWO 
IN FRONT FIVE TO TWO BEHIND KNOCKED NICE 
WELL DONE NOT NICE HE WAS 
FORCED TO GO FOR THERE HE DID NOT 
HAVE ANOTHER SHOT ON 
HE WOULD NOT HAVE FANCIED JOE PERRY 
TO MAKE THAT RED THE WAY HE HAS 
BEEN PLAYING IN THE LAST TEN MINUTES 
LOADS OF REDS ABOUT THE COLOURS 
ARE LITTLE MIXED UP 
I AM NOT TOO SURE WHETHER JOE HIT 
THAT LAST RED AS CLEANLY AS HE 
WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT WAS THE 
EASIEST RED IN THE WORLD IT HIT 
THE JAW THREE TIMES HE WOULD BE 
HORRIFIED IF HE DOES NOT WIN THE 
FRAME NOW TO GET OUT OF THE 
SESSION FIVE TO THREE AND THINK HE WOULD BE 
HAPPY HIS BODY DID MEANER AGAIN 
HE HAS GIVEN IT THE FULL TEN TO ZERO AS 
IF EVERYTHING IS ON HIS SHOULDER 
DEMEANOUR THINGS HAVE NOT GONE 
THAT WRONG JOE YOU ARE HAVING 
CHANCES MY FRIEND JUST GET IT 
TOGETHER 
A GOOD RECOVERY HE HAS GOT BACK IN 
PRIME POSITION NOW 
HE HAS GOT THEM WHERE HE WANT THEM 
NOW THIS IS A PRACTICE SITUATION 
HE WILL BE DELIGHTED AT FIVE TO THREE HER HER WOULDN'T SAY THAT WILLIE BUT I 
KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN I WOULDN'T 
SAY THAT 
HE HAS HAD CHANCES EVERY 
FRAME JOE HAS JUST BEEN HANGING ON 
TO WIN THREE FRAMES WHEN YOU ARE 
NOT FEELING YOUR BEST IT IS A GOOD 
PERFORMANCE SOMETIMES 
EARLIER IN 
THIS FRAME WHEN STUART BINGHAM 
KNOCKED A LONG RED ON HE MUST HAVE 
THOUGHT HE WOULD CLEAR UP IN THE 
MEANTIME HE HAVE LOST THE NEXT 
SAFETY BATTLE AGAINST JOE PERRY 
HE HAS LOST PLENTY OF EASY REDS TO 
GET ON WHICH IS A HELP HE WILL 
HAVE TO WATCH THE CUE BALL DOES NOT 
SKIP OUT OF CONTROL 
IT IS GETTING AIR LITTLE BIT MORE 
DIFFICULT AS IT GOES ALONG A LOT 
OF THE COLOURS ARE COVERING EACH 
OTHER BLACK WILL NOT GO PAST GREEN 
OR BROWN YELLOW DOES NOT GO PAST 
THE RED ON THE LEFT OR THE BROWN 
STILL A BIT TO DO NOT SURE WHAT HE 
PLAYED FOR THEM HE IS CERTAINLY 
NOT ON THE YELLOW BLACK DOESN'T GO 
SO IT IS THE GREEN NOW BE IT IS 
THE GREEN NOW YOU CAN GET IN THE 
FRAME OF MIND WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO 
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING AND TRYING TO 
BE A LITTLE TOO CAREFUL WHICH IS 
UNDERSTANDABLE AWAY THE SESSION HAS 
GROWN FROM JOE PERRY'S POINT OF 
VIEW THE WAY HIS FIRST MINI CRISIS PERRY IS FORTY SEVEN POINTS IN FRONT 
NO NEED TO BRING THE DIFFICULT RED 
INTO PLAY HE COULD COME A LITTLE 
AWKWARD HERE HE PLAYED FOR BLACK 
HE MAY TAKE THE MORE DIFFICULT 
BROWN NOW CUEING OVER THAT RED TO 
THE LEFT OF THE CUE BALL FOR 
BRANIFF TRICKY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN 
YOU HAVE A HUGE MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB 
THE BROWN IS A BIT TRICKY HE HAS RETAINED POSITION 
THAT WAS THE RED HE WANTED THAT 
HAS PUT HIM SAFE 
THAT SHOULD PUT ANY GAPS OUT OF THE 
WAY FOR JOE PERRY IN THIS FRAME 
ANY DOUBT THIS HAS BEEN A VERY 
GOOD EFFORT HE MAY LOOK AT IT AND 
THEN THEY WERE ALL ON BUT WHEN 
YOU ARE UNDER PRESSURE IT IS TOUGH 
STUART BINGHAM WILL BE A BIT 
DISAPPOINTED BUT WHEN HE REFLECTS 
LATER ONE FIVE TO THREE IS NOT TOO BAD FROM 
HIS POINT OF VIEW LATER ON 
BY SIXTY FIVE THEN AND JOE PERRY HAS PULLED 
ONE BACK HE NOW TRAILS BY FIVE TO THREE 
A GOOD START A GOOD START FROM 
STUART BINGHAM FURTHER COVERAGE 
FROM HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE AT TEN A M. 
PRESS THE RED BUTTON TO SEE THE 
ACTION GOODBYE 
ONLY YO OU 
CAN MAKE THIS WORLD SEEM BRIGHT 
WE GOT COMPANY 
ONLY YOU 
SOME THINGS GET BETTER WITH AGE 
THE INDIANA JONES TRILOGY BEGINS
