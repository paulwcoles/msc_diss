CHINA HOME TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SCHOOL CHILDREN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PRIMARY SCHOOLS 
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE LANGUAGES AND THE SMALL TOWN OF XIUNING 
THIS IS THE STORY OF THREE SCHOOLS HERE 
AND LIFE OVER THE YEAR OF THE GOLDEN PIG 
XIUNING IS HOME TO JUST FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
TINY BY CHINESE STANDARDS 
IT LIES IN THE RURAL PROVINCE OF ANHUI FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY KILOMETRES FROM SHANGHAI 
ALTHOUGH CHINA IS STILL A ONE PARTY COMMUNIST STATE 
EVEN HERE IN XIUNING THE PACE OF CHANGE IS FAST 
NEW AND OLD MEET IN A TOWN THAT'S PROUD OF TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS 
TEA AND TEACHING 
WE'LL FOLLOW LIFE AT THREE OF XIUNING'S SCHOOLS 
THE XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL A HOTHOUSE FOR TOP SCHOLARS 
HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL 
WHICH IS A LITTLE LESS PRESSURED 
AND PING MIN PRIMARY A NEW CHARITY RUN SCHOOL 
THREE SCHOOLS IN ONE TOWN IN A SMALL CORNER OF CHINA 
IT'S EARLY MAY AND THESE CHILDREN ARE PREPARING TO FACE A CHALLENGE 
THAT WILL CHANGE THEIR LIVES FOREVER 
MR. HU THE HEADMASTER OF XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL REMINDS HIS STUDENTS OF THE ODDS AGAINST THEM 
XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL IS THE TOP SCHOOL IN TOWN 
AND ONE OF THE BEST IN ALL OF ANHUI A PROVINCE OF MORE THAN EIGHTY MILLION PEOPLE 
THE CHILDREN AT THE SCHOOL RANGE FROM SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN 
EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS EXCELLED ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE CHINESE EDUCATION SYSTEM 
AND OUT OF THE TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN AT THE SCHOOL 
ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING IS SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WU YI FEI 
MORE THAN TEN MILLION STUDENTS WILL SIT THE G. A. O. KAO THE UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE EXAM 
WU YI FEI'S CLASS TUTOR MR. HE EXPECTS A LOT OF HER 
MY STUDENT WU FEI IS THE BEST STUDENT IN THIS SCHOOL 
SHE'S ALSO ONE OF THE BEST STUDENTS IN THIS PROVINCE 
SO OUR SCHOOL HOPE THAT SHE CAN SCORE VERY HIGH 
I MEAN TO BRING TO MAKE THIS SCHOOL EVEN MORE FAMOUS I MEAN 
BUT RIGHT NOW WU YI FEI AND HER FRIENDS HAVE OTHER THINGS ON THEIR MINDS 
WU YI FEI'S MOTHER IS DOING EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO MAXIMISE HER DAUGHTER'S CHANCES OF SUCCESS 
LIKE ALMOST EVERY SCHOOL PUPIL IN CHINA WU YI FEI IS AN ONLY CHILD 
EVERY DAY MRS. WU COOKS TWO MEALS AND BRINGS THEM TO HER DAUGHTER 
SO WU YI FEI DOESN'T LOSE A MOMENT OF STUDY TIME 
A MILE AWAY IT'S THE START OF ANOTHER DAY AT THE TOWN'S OTHER SECONDARY SCHOOL 
HALLO 
TAKING CHILDREN FROM TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL 
ISN'T AS ACADEMICALLY DEMANDING AS THE HIGH SCHOOL 
BUT STUDENTS HERE DO SIT MAJOR EXAMS WHEN THEY'RE SIXTEEN 
THE BRIGHTEST THEN HOPE TO TRANSFER TO XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL 
FOR A BETTER CHANCE OF GOING ON TO A TOP UNIVERSITY 
IT'S ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY BUT INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE CANTEEN 
TO EAT WITH HIS FRIENDS SIXTEEN YEAR OLD LIU XIANG IS TAKING A WORKING LUNCH 
HE'S SITTING MOCK EXAMS IN FOUR WEEKS 
EVERY SPARE MINUTE IS SPENT REVISING BECAUSE HE'S SET HIS HEART ON GETTING INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL 
BUT EXAMS AREN'T HIS ONLY INTEREST 
HE LOVES CHINESE POP MUSIC 
AND HIS DAD'S TAXI 
EVEN THOUGH HE CAN'T DRIVE LIU XIANG'S DESPERATE TO GET BEHIND THE WHEEL 
IN XIUNING TOWN DAWN IS GREETED WITH EXERCISES PRACTICED THIS WAY 
FOR OVER ONE THOUSAND YEARS 
AND SOME NEWER ONES TOO 
BUT TODAY IS NO ORDINARY DAY 
ONCE A YEAR CHINESE FAMILIES GET TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE QING MING 
THE GRAVE SWEEPING FESTIVAL IS A TIME FOR PEOPLE TO VISIT 
FAMILY GRAVES OFFER UP PRAYERS AND PAY RESPECTS TO THEIR ANCESTORS 
TODAY LIU XIANG WILL TRY TO STOP WORRYING ABOUT THE FUTURE 
AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON THE PAST 
THE FAMILY STOCK UP ON INCENSE FIREWORKS AND HELL MONEY REPLICA BANKNOTES 
BURNED TO GIVE THE ANCESTORS SOME SPARE CASH IN THE AFTERLIFE 
AND COMMUNICATION SOMETIMES MEANS ASKING FOR A LITTLE EXTRA HELP 
THE WHOLE FAMILY IS THERE INCLUDING GRANDMA LIU 
FOR THE FINAL YEAR STUDENTS AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL EVERYTHING IS FOCUSED ON THE EXAMS 
TODAY TOP STUDENT WU YI FEI AND HER CLASS ARE AT THE LOCAL HOSPITAL 
FOR THE COMPULSORY PRE EXAM CHECK UP 
EVERY CHINESE STUDENT IS TESTED TO ENSURE THEY'RE HEALTHY ENOUGH TO TAKE UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE EXAMS 
THE TESTS CAN AFFECT THEIR WHOLE FUTURE 
FOR WU YU FEI IT'S A RARE CHANCE TO PUT DOWN HER BOOKS 
THE RANGE OF TESTS ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE IN PERFECT WORKING ORDER FOR UNIVERSITY 
NO SENSE IS LEFT UNCHECKED 
WITH A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH THEY CAN NOW FOCUS ON THE REAL CHALLENGE AHEAD 
EVERY DAY AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL 
IS A TEST OF FITNESS AND ENDURANCE STARTING AT FIVE FORTY FIVE A M. 
BY SIX AM THEY'RE AT THEIR DESKS FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF SELF STUDY 
READING ALOUD IS THE PREFERRED WAY TO LEARN SUBJECTS BY HEART 
AFTER THIS THERE'S THIRTY MINUTES OF AEROBIC EXERCISE 
ALL BEFORE BREAKFAST 
IT'S THEN BACK TO THE CLASSROOM 
WHERE LESSONS RUN UNTIL ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY 
HELLO NICE TO SEE YOU ALL HERE 
LUNCH IS FOLLOWED BY NINETY MINUTES OF FREE TIME AND CLASSES START AGAIN 
WITH FIFTEEN MINUTES OF EYE EXERCISES 
WHICH CHAIRMAN MAO BELIEVED HELPED TO IMPROVE EYESIGHT 
LESSONS CONTINUE UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK 
THEN AFTER DINNER IT'S BACK IN THE CLASSROOM AT SEVEN P. M. FOR MORE STUDY 
FROM MONDAY TO SATURDAY CLASS ENDS EVERY NIGHT AT ONE THOUSAND FIFTEEN 
AT ONE THOUSAND THIRTY TEACHERS CLEAR THE CLASSROOMS OF ANY STUDENTS 
WHO MIGHT STILL BE TRYING TO STUDY 
MOST CHILDREN HEAD TO THEIR DORMS 
BUT FINAL YEAR PUPILS LIKE WU YI FEI STILL HAVE HOURS OF WORK TO GO 
LIKE MANY OTHER EXAM YEAR STUDENTS SHE'S RENTED A ROOM OFF CAMPUS 
SO SHE CAN CARRY ON WORKING WHEN THE CLASSROOM LIGHTS HAVE BEEN SWITCHED OFF 
EVERY NIGHT WU YI FEI'S MOTHER LEAVES THE FAMILY HOME TEN MINUTES AWAY 
TO STAY THE NIGHT WITH HER DAUGHTER 
AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ANOTHER AVERAGE DAY FOR WU YI FEI COMES TO AN END 
IT'S SIX A M. AT PING MIN PRIMARY SCHOOL 
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF XIUNING TOWN 
AND CLOSE TO THE FAMOUS YELLOW MOUNTAINS IT RECRUITS CHILDREN FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTY 
EVERY CHINESE CHILD IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE NINE YEARS OF FORMAL EDUCATION 
FOR THESE CHILDREN PING MIN SCHOOL IS THEIR FIRST STEP ON THE LONG MARCH TO UNIVERSITY 
THE SCHOOL'S HEADMISTRESS IS MRS. ZHANG 
UNDER HER WATCHFUL EYE ARE SIXTY CHILDREN RANGING BETWEEN THE AGES OF SEVEN AND TWELVE 
PING MIN IS A CHARITY FUNDED SCHOOL ONE OF A GROWING NUMBER IN CHINA 
IT AIMS TO TEACH A BROADER CURRICULUM THAN MOST ORDINARY CHINESE SCHOOLS 
PRIMARY SCHOOL IS FREE IN CHINA 
BUT MANY PARENTS STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR BOOKS AND OTHER SCHOOL EXPENSES 
PING MIN'S A BOARDING SCHOOL BUT BECAUSE IT'S RUN BY A CHARITY 
ALL FOOD CLOTHING AND SCHOOL BOOKS ARE PROVIDED FREE 
THE CHILDREN COME FROM POOR FAMILIES WHO COULDN'T AFFORD THESE EXTRAS THEMSELVES 
THIS IS GAN PING 
SHE'S TEN YEARS OLD AND HAS BEEN AT THE SCHOOL FOR TWO YEARS 
SHE LIKES PICKING TEA WITH HER DAD 
MAKING THINGS AND GARDENING 
BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHE LOVES TO SKIP 
TODAY IS A BIG DAY FOR GAN PING BECAUSE MRS. ZHANG HAS ASKED HER TO BE A SPECIAL HELPER IN CLASS 
SHE'LL BE ACTING IN A PLAY DESIGNED TO TEACH THE PUPILS TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR POSSESSIONS 
AT THE START OF TERM THE SCHOOL PROVIDES EACH OF THEM WITH THEIR OWN PENCIL AND ERASER 
BUT ONE OF THE CHILDREN HASN'T TREATED THEIRS WELL 
AND IS ABOUT TO BE TAUGHT A LESSON CHINESE STYLE 
GAN PING AND THE OTHER CLASS MONITORS LOOK FOR THE BEST KEPT EXAMPLES 
THE CLASS THEN VOTES ON THE MOST BATTERED ERASER 
IT'S SEVEN YEAR OLD WEN HONG CHANG 
AS A SIGN OF FORGIVENESS WEN HONG CHANG MUST SHAKE HANDS 
WITH EVERY ONE OF HIS CLASSMATES AND RECITE THE PROMISE SONG 
AN HOUR LATER ALL IS FORGIVEN AND FORGOTTEN 
AS THE CHILDREN HEAD OUT TO THE ORGANIC VEGETABLE PATCH FERTILISED FROM THE SCHOOL'S LATRINES 
WEN HONG CHANG SEEMS TO HAVE RECOVERED FROM HIS EARLIER LESSON 
WHILST THE PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN DO PHYSICAL LABOUR IN THE FIELDS 
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE DOING EXERCISES OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT KIND 
ALL FINAL YEAR STUDENTS IN MAINSTREAM SECONDARY SCHOOLS TAKE AN ACADEMIC EXAM 
TO GET INTO UNIVERSITY BUT THERE'S ALSO AN OPTION TO MAJOR IN SPORTS 
ON TOP OF THE ACADEMIC EXAM THESE STUDENTS HAVE TO DO A PRACTICAL ATHLETICS TEST 
WHICH COUNTS FOR FIFTY PER CENT OF THEIR FINAL MARK 
MR. WANG THE P. E. TEACHER WAS HIMSELF A STUDENT AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL 
NOW HE'S PREPARING HIS STUDENTS FOR THEIR GREATEST CHALLENGE 
ONE OF MR. WANG'S TOP SPORTS STUDENTS IS SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD HU KAI 
HE'S IN HIS FINAL YEAR AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL 
ALL THE TRAINING MEANS HE WORKS UP A FEARSOME APPETITE 
THOUGH HE'S OFTEN TOO SLOW TO GET HIS FAVOURITE STUFF 
HU KAI STUDIES TEN HOURS A DAY AND TRAINS ANOTHER THREE HOURS DAILY FOR HIS SPORTS EXAMS 
THE SPORTS STUDENTS HAVE THEIR OWN WAY OF BRINGING THEMSELVES GOOD LUCK 
THERE'S AN ADDED INCENTIVE TO DO WELL BECAUSE MR. WANG 
HAS THREATENED HIS LITTLE PIGS IF THEY DON'T SUCCEED 
BUT DESPITE MR. WANG'S TOUGHNESS HU KAI LOOKS UP TO HIM 
TOMORROW HU KAI WILL TRAVEL TWO HUNDRED MILES TO ANHUI TEACHER TRAINING UNIVERSITY 
TO COMPETE IN THE EXAM HE'S SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS WORKING FOR 
AT HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL LIU XIANG AND HIS CLASSMATES HAVE A RARE CHANCE TO UNWIND 
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING HARD FOR MOCK EXAMS SO THEIR TEACHERS HAVE ORGANISED A DAY OUT 
AS A POP MUSIC FAN LIU XIANG GETS THE SINGING GOING ALTHOUGH HE'S GOT COMPETITION 
FORTY FIVE MINUTES FROM XIUNING TOWN THE YELLOW MOUNTAINS 
ARE ONE OF CHINA'S MOST POPULAR PILGRIMAGE AND TOURIST SITES 
TO CELEBRATE THREE YEARS AS CLASSMATES THE CHILDREN HAVE BOUGHT THEMSELVES A BIRTHDAY CAKE 
AS USUAL LIU XIANG LEADS THE SINGING 
BUT DESPITE THE HIGH SPIRITS IT'S HARD TO FORGET THAT THE MOCKS ARE NEXT WEEK 
BUT THIS ANCIENT WISDOM OFFERS LITTLE COMFORT FOR LIU XIANG 
FOR SOME OF THE CHILDREN THE TRIP HAS BEEN A RELAXING BREAK BUT NOT EVERYONE CAN SLEEP 
AT PING MIN PRIMARY SCHOOL THEY'RE HALF WAY THROUGH THEIR SUMMER TERM 
TEN YEAR OLD GAN PING HAS WORKED REALLY HARD AND IS CURRENTLY TOP OF HER YEAR 
ALTHOUGH IT'S JUST A TWO MILE BUS RIDE AWAY 
A TRIP TO XIUNING TOWN IS A BIG DEAL FOR A COUNTRY GIRL LIKE GAN PING 
WITH A POPULATION OF JUST FIFTY THOUSAND XIUNING TOWN HARDLY REGISTERS ON THE MAP OF CHINA 
BUT IT'S CHANGING FAST AND SEEMS A WORLD AWAY FROM THE TRANQUILLITY OF PING MIN SCHOOL 
LIFE AT PING MIN SEEMS GOOD FOR GAN PING 
BUT HER GRANDMOTHER KNOWS IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT JUST TWO YEARS AGO 
NEARLY A QUARTER OF ADULTS HAVE LEFT ANHUI PROVINCE TO FIND JOBS ELSEWHERE 
MAKING THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY UNIT LESS AND LESS COMMON 
GAN PING'S HOME IS WITH HER GRANDPARENTS IN A REMOTE TEA PRODUCING VILLAGE 
AS FARMERS THEY ALWAYS STRUGGLED TO PAY SCHOOL FEES 
SO WHEN PING MIN OFFERED HER A SCHOLARSHIP IT SEEMED THE CHANCE OF A BETTER LIFE 
THE HILLS OF ANHUI MAY BE BEAUTIFUL BUT MANY OF THEIR INHABITANTS ARE PARTICULARLY POOR 
EVERY YEAR IN MAY HEADMISTRESS MRS. ZHANG HEADS DEEP INTO THE MOUNTAINS 
TO FIND SCHOLARSHIP CANDIDATES FOR PING MIN SCHOOL 
FIRST STOP IS THE TINY HAMLET OF SHITING 
THEY HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT THE HOME OF SIX YEAR OLD CHEN WEI PING 
LAST YEAR CHEN WEI PING WAS ABANDONED BY HIS MOTHER 
LEAVING HIS GRANDPARENTS TO LOOK AFTER HIM 
HE'S AN IDEAL CANDIDATE FOR THE SCHOOL 
BUT WITH HIS MOTHER GONE THEY CAN'T IMMEDIATELY OFFER HIM A PLACE 
BECAUSE SHE'S STILL HIS LEGAL GUARDIAN 
MRS. ZHANG AND HER TEAM HEAD OFF ON THE THREE HOUR JOURNEY TO SEE THEIR NEXT HOPEFUL FAMILY 
THE TEACHERS HAVE REACHED THEIR DECISION 
ALTHOUGH IT MEANS LEAVING HER FATHER BEHIND 
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR CHENG LIU HUI M. E. I. TO START A NEW LIFE 
ANHUI TEACHER TRAINING STADIUM 
HU KAI AND TEN THOUSAND OTHER COMPETITORS ARE FIGHTING FOR ATHLETICS PLACES AT UNIVERSITY 
BY MIDDAY TEMPERATURES EXCEED THIRTY FIVE DEGREES 
HU KAI'S PERFORMANCE IS NOT LIVING UP TO EXPECTATIONS 
THE SHOT PUT THE ONE HUNDRED AND THE FOUR HUNDRED METRES HAVE ALL GONE BADLY 
HU KAI IS CALLED FOR HIS LAST AND TOUGHEST RACE THE EIGHT HUNDRED METRES 
IT'S HIS FINAL CHANCE TO RESCUE HIS SCORE 
RUNNING AT NUMBER THIRTEEN HU KAI HAS TO FINISH IN THE TOP FIVE 
STARTER'S PISTOL 
AT THE HALFWAY MARK HE'S SITTING NEAR THE BACK OF THE FIELD 
BUT WITH TWO HUNDRED METRES TO GO HE STARTS TO MAKE HIS MOVE 
THIRD IT'S A GREAT RESULT FOR HU KAI 
DESPITE RUNNING A GREAT RACE HU KAI STILL DOESN'T KNOW IF IT'LL BE ENOUGH TO RAISE HIS OVERALL SCORE 
AS THE RESULTS COME IN FOR SOME OF THE STUDENTS THE FINISHING LINE SEEMS AS FAR AWAY AS EVER 
BUT HU KAI HAS DONE IT 
THOUGH WITH HIS WRITTEN EXAMS JUST A MONTH AWAY THAT'S ONLY HALF THE BATTLE 
AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL HEADMASTER HU HAS CALLED IN THE PARENTS 
THEY ARE ALSO BEING PREPARED FOR THE EXAMS 
IT'S A WORRYING TIME FOR WU YI FEI'S MUM 
SHE GAVE UP HER CAREER TO BECOME A FULL TIME COOK AND COACH FOR HER DAUGHTER 
IT'S FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY AM AND THE CHILDREN AT PING MIN 
HAVE TO GET THE SCHOOL SPOTLESS BEFORE THE GOLDEN WEEK HOLIDAY 
THEN IT'S A BREAKFAST OF STEAMED BREAD BUNS RICE AND BOILED EGGS 
AS SCHOOL BREAKS UP PARENTS ARRIVE TO TAKE THEIR CHILDREN HOME 
DESPITE HAVING BEEN READY FOR NEARLY FIVE HOURS 
IT LOOKS LIKE GAN PING WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR GRANDPA A WHILE LONGER YET 
THE GOLDEN WEEK HOLIDAY AND THE XIUNING TEA FESTIVAL ARE UNDER WAY 
IT'S A TIME TO RELAX UNLESS YOU'RE REVISING 
WITH ONLY FIVE DAYS UNTIL THE MOCKS EVERY MINUTE COUNTS FOR THE EXAM STUDENTS 
AS THE WEEK COMES TO AN END THE FESTIVITIES CLIMAX 
AND REVISION REACHES FEVER PITCH 
FOR WU YI FEI AND HU KAI THESE MOCKS ARE THE LAST TEST 
BEFORE THE REAL EXAMS IN A MONTH 
THEY'RE AN INDICATION OF WHAT THEY STILL NEED TO DO 
TO GET INTO THEIR FIRST CHOICE UNIVERSITY 
MEANWHILE AT HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL LIU XIANG IS SITTING HIS MOCKS TOO 
HE HOPES THAT NEXT YEAR IF ALL GOES WELL HE'LL BE ABLE TO TRANSFER TO XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL 
TWO DAYS LATER THE XIUNING STUDENTS ARE GIVEN THEIR RESULTS 
FIRST UP IS SPORTS STUDENT HU KAI 
SECOND IS TOP STUDENT WU YI FEI 
SHE SCORED THE HIGHEST MARK IN THE SCHOOL'S HISTORY 
BUT GOOD RESULTS IN THE MOCKS DON'T SEEM TO HAVE RELIEVED THE TENSION 
AT HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL LIU XIANG'S MOCK RESULTS HAVE ALSO COME IN 
AS A REWARD LIU XIANG'S DAD IS GIVING HIM 
THE ONE THING HE REALLY WANTS BESIDES EXAM SUCCESS 
HIS FIRST DRIVING LESSON 
IT'S A BIG YEAR FOR ALL OF THESE CHILDREN 
IT'S ALSO BEEN AN AUSPICIOUS START 
FOR THE EXAM STUDENTS AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL 
THEY'VE GOT THROUGH THEIR MOCKS 
BUT THEIR GREATEST CHALLENGE IS NOW JUST A MONTH AWAY 
NEXT TIME ON CHINESE SCHOOL IT'S THE REAL THING 
HOW WILL WU YI FEI DO IN THE G. A. O. KAO 
THE MOST COMPETITIVE EXAM SYSTEM IN THE WORLD
