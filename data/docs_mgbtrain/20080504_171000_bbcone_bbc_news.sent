IN A CAR NEAR GLASGOW POLICE SAY 
THEY ARE TREATING THEM AS 
SUSPICIOUS MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE 
ARE KILLED AND NINETY THOUSAND ARE LEFT 
HOMELESS AFTER BURMA IS HIT BY A 
CYCLONE FOOTBALL'S HEARTACHE AND 
HEROES LEICESTER RELEGATED BUT 
STOKE PROMOTED TO THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE 
GOOD EVENING GORDON BROWN HAS 
ADMITTED MAKING MISTAKES IN RECENT 
MONTHS AND SAID HE FELT RESPONSIBLE 
FOR LABOUR'S POOR PERFORMANCE IN 
THEIRS LOCAL ELECTIONS MR. BROWN 
INSISTED TODAY THAT HE WOULDN'T BE 
PUT OFF BY A FEW DAYS HEADLINES HE 
SAID LABOUR WOULD RECOVER IN TIME 
FOR THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION 
TODAY THE CONSERVATIVES SAID THE 
PRIME MINISTER WAS NOW IN A 
PHILOSOPHICAL VACUUM LET'S GET 
LATEST FROM LAURA KUENSSBERG IN 
DOWNING STREET IT'S BEEN A 
TERRIBLE FEW DAYS FOR GORDON BROWN 
ONE LABOUR M. P. TOLD THE B. B. C. IF HE 
CAN'T HANDLE NUMBER TEN HE SHOULD 
GET OUT ANOTHER SAID THAT LABOUR 
HAS LOST THE KNACK OF TELLING ITS 
STORY TODAY N. AN INTERVIEW WITH 
THE B. B. C. GORDON BROWN TRIED TO 
START A NEW CHAPTER GORDON BROWN 
CAME FORWARD TODAY TO ADMIT HIS OWN 
FAILINGS FACING DEMANDS FROM HIS 
OWN SIDE THAT HE SHOW A DIFFERENT 
FACE THEPM ACCEPTED SOME OF THE 
BLAME SO HE STEPPED OUT OF HIS 
COMFORT ZONE AND INTO THE T. V. STUDIO 
FOR HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE 
THURSDAY NIGHT'S LABOUR DISASTER 
THEPM HAS BEEN HURT BY DEFEAT BUT 
SAYS HE UNDERSTANDS THE PUBLIC'S 
PAIN PAIN I FEEL THE HURT THAT THEY FEEL 
PETROL PRICE GOING UP FOOD PRICES 
GOING UP THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
THEIR UTILITY BILL THEY WORRIED 
ABOUT THE STANDARD OF LIVING THERE 
IS AN UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
I HAVE DEALT WITH SOME OF THESE 
PROBLEMS BEFORE WHEN I HAVE BEEN 
CHANCELLOR WE HAVE TO SHOW PEOPLE 
THERE IS A CLEAR AND UNEQUIVOCAL 
DIRECTION WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC PLAN 
TO TAKE US THROUGH THESE THINGS 
WITH MANY DESPAIRING OF THE PICTURE 
THE PUBLIC HAS OF LABOUR GORDON 
BROWN DECIDED TO PUT HIMSELF IN THE 
TPWRAIM A RESPONSE TO FRAME A 
RESPONSE THAT HE AND HIS TEAM ARE 
IN DENIAL HE DIDN'T FIND IT EASY 
BUT ADMITTED THERE WERE MISTAKES 
PEOPLE SENSE WE HAVE MADE MISTAKES 
ON THE TEN PENCE RATE 
ANY OTHER 
MISTAKES 
I THINK IF I WAS TO LOOK MISTAKES BACK ON THE LAST YEAR L. LET 
SPECULATION ABOUT THE GENERAL 
ELECTION GO TOO LONG I HAVE 
ADMITTED THAT WAS A PROBLEM WAS 
THERE PERHAPS I HAVE SPENT TOO 
LITTLE TIME THINKING ABOUT HOW WE 
CAN GET OUR ARGUMENTS ACROSS TO THE 
PUBLIC NOW OF COURSE I THINK 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING CAN YOU SHOW US 
YOU CAN COME THROUGH THE DIFFICULT 
SITUATIONS I BELIEVE WE WILL 
GORDON BROWN APPEARED TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE HE IS PART OF LABOUR'S 
PROBLEM PROBLEM I THINK IT'S TRUE THAT I AM A MORE 
PRIVATE PERSON IN A PUBLIC ARENA 
PERHAPS I HAVE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME 
AS YOU HAVE SAID LOOKING AT THE 
DETAIL OF SOLVING PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS 
TO SOLVE PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS HAVE YOU 
TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PROBLEMS L. 
THINK IF I COMMUNICATE TO PEOPLE 
THAT GOING AROUND THE COUNTRY I AM 
LISTENING TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
AND I HAVE HEARD WHAT PEOPLE HAVE 
SAID SAID HOW DOES IT FEEL BEING MAYOR 
PROPER 
IT FEELS VERY GOOD PROPER BUT THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE NO 
REASON TO HESITATE TO APPEAR IN 
PUBLIC THEIR NEW MAYOR OF LONDON 
BORIS JOHNSON CELEBRATED HIS 
VICTORY AT A SIKH FESTIVAL THIS 
AFTERNOON HIS PARTY IS ENJOYING 
LABOUR'S WOES 
GORDON BROWN IS A 
PHILOSOPHICAL VACUUM HE IS A MAN 
WHO SPENT HIS LEAVE TRYING TO GET 
TO BE PRIME MINISTER BUT DOESN'T 
SEEM TO KNOW WHAT HE WANTS TO DO 
WITH IT NOW HE IS THERE 
THERE IS NO SERIOUS TALK ABOUT ANY 
OTHER LABOUR POLITICIAN PUTTING 
HIMSELF IN THE LEADERSHIP FRAME 
BUT NO SIGNS OF GORDON BROWN 
PUSHING HIS CRITICS AWAY 
THERE WAS SOME SPECULATION MOST OF 
IT PRETTY WILD ABOUT POTENTIAL 
PEOPLE COMING FORWARD AT THIS 
STAGE THAT REALLY IS FICTION THAT 
SAID THERE IS A SMALL BAND OF SOME 
OF LABOUR'S MORE OUTSPOKEN M. P.'S WHO 
REALLY HAVE PUT GORDON BROWN ON 
NOTICE SAYING HE HAS TO SORT THINGS 
OUT BY THE PARTY'S CONFERENCE IN 
AUTUMN OR THE PICTURE COULD LOOK 
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT SO WHAT IS HE PLANNING TO DO THEN 
THAT IS NOT CLEAR THEN THAT IS 
PART OF THE PROBLEM IT'S ONE THING 
SAYING I FEEL YOUR PAIN IF THAT IS 
NOT FOLLOWED UP WITH DECISIVE 
ACTION IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW 
GORDON BROWN CAN TURN THIS AROUND 
HE DID PROMISE TODAY A RAFT OF NEW 
POLICIES COMING FORWARD IN THE NEXT 
FEW WEEKS BUT WE DON'T AT THIS 
STAGE HAVE VERY MANY CLUES ABOUT 
WHAT THEY MAY BE L. UNDERSTAND THAT 
SOME LABOUR FIGURES SENIOR ONES IN 
THE PARTY ARE PREPARING TO PUT MORE 
PRESSURE ON THE LEADERSHIP OVER TAX 
GORDON BROWN TODAY DIDN'T RULE OUT 
POTENTIALLY DELAYING OR SCRAPPING 
THE SUGGESTED INCREASE IN FUEL DUTY 
THAT IS MEANT TO COME IN IN THE 
AUTUMN AS THINGS STAND THIS 
EVENING WE HAVE HAD SOMETHING OF A 
FIGHTBACK BUT NOTHING CONCRETE 
ABOUT HOW GORDON BROWN IS GOING TO 
ACT
