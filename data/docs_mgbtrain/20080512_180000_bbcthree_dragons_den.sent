YOUR REPUTATION IS SHOT YOU'VE ALREADY NOT DELIVERED TWENTY FOUR MACHINES 
HONESTLY YOU'RE IN CLOUD CUCKOO LAND MILES AWAY FROM REALITY 
THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THIS WILL NOT WORK 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOUR VALUING A BUSINESS AT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AND THERE ISN'T A BUSINESS 
THE DRAGONS HAVE ALL IT TAKES TO BE SUCCESSFUL 
FIVE OF BRITAIN'S MOST ENTERPRISING AND WEALTHY BUSINESS PEOPLE 
THEY'VE ALL BUILT UP THEIR OWN FORTUNES FROM SCRATCH 
NEW DRAGON JAMES CAAN MADE HIS MILLIONS BUILDING A GLOBAL BUSINESS IN THE RECRUITING INDUSTRY 
AND HE NOW HEADS AN INTERNATIONAL PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM 
GLASWEGIAN ENTREPRENEUR DUNCAN BANNATYNE'S TWO HUNDRED MILLION BUSINESS EMPIRE 
INCLUDES HOTELS CASINOS AND HEALTH CLUBS 
DEBORAH MEADEN EARNED HER FORTUNE IN THE HOLIDAY AND LEISURE INDUSTRY IN THE WEST COUNTRY 
THEO PAPHITAS IS A RETAIL MAGNATE WHO HAS TRANSFORMED THE FORTUNES OF HIGH STREET BRANDS 
LIKE RYMAN LA SENZA PARTNERS AND CONTESSA 
ONE OF BRITAIN'S BEST KNOWN ENTREPRENEURS PETER JONES 
HAS BUILT UP A MULTI MILLION POUND EMPIRE 
WITH A BUSINESS PORTFOLIO THAT RANGES FROM TELECOMS AND LEISURE TO PROPERTY AND MEDIA 
IN THE DEN THE DRAGONS ARE READY TO BACK THE RIGHT BUSINESSES WITH THEIR OWN MONEY 
BUT TONIGHT WILL ANYONE CONVINCE THEM TO INVEST 
WELCOME BACK TO THE DRAGONS' DEN 
EVERY ENTREPRENEUR WHO COMES HERE 
IS CONVINCED THEIR IDEA COULD MAKE THEM RICH 
BUT EACH OF THEM NEEDS A CASH INJECTION TO GET THEIR BUSINESS GOING 
OUR DRAGONS CAN PROVIDE THE BACKING THEY NEED 
BUT IT'S THEIR OWN MONEY SO EXPECT THEM TO ASK SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS 
SO HOW WILL OUR FIRST ENTREPRENEUR COPE UNDER THE DRAGONS' SCRUTINY 
I AM SAMMY FRENCH THIS IS DAFFY YES NAMED AFTER DAFFY DUCK 
MY CHILDREN NAMED HIM 
MY COMPANY IS FIT FUR LIFE LIMITED AND I'M PITCHING FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF MY BUSINESS 
I HAVE DEVELOPED ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED CANINE TREADMILLS 
IN ORDER TO HELP IN THE REHABILITATION PROCESS POST INJURY AND OPERATION 
AND ALSO IT WILL HELP IN FITNESS IN THE BUILD UP TO COMPETITION LEVELS 
THE REASON WHY THIS TREADMILL IS SO UNIQUE 
IS DUE TO THE FINELY ADJUSTABLE INCLINE AND DECLINE FEATURES OF THE TREADMILL 
ALSO IT HAS AN EXTREMELY DELICATE CONTROL OF SPEED 
THE PRODUCT IS AIMED AT VETS THE POLICE FORCE 
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR KENNELS YOUR QUARANTINE AND RESCUE CENTRES 
I'VE TESTED THIS MARKET WITH A PREVIOUS MODEL AND I'VE SOLD ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN UNITS 
I AM UNFORTUNATELY HAVING TO TURN AWAY BUSINESS 
BECAUSE I SIMPLY CANNOT SUPPLY THE DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCT AT THIS STAGE 
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH ANY INVESTMENT 
IS TO FINANCE THE PRODUCTION RUN OF THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MACHINES 
AND THEN THE SALES GENERATED FROM THAT 
WILL FULLY CAPITALISE ALL THE WORKING REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY AND ANY FUTURE STOCK 
SAMMY FRENCH AND DAFFY ARE ASKING FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
FOR TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF FIT FUR LIFE A CANINE TREADMILL DESIGNED TO REHABILITATE SICK DOGS 
SAMMY SAYS SHE'S ALREADY HAVING TO TURN AWAY ORDERS FOR THE TREADMILL 
BUT DOG OWNER PETER JONES HAS OTHER CONCERNS 
HI SAMMY I'M PETER HI 
I'VE GOT SORT OF MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IT AND IT KIND OF MAKES ME FEEL SAD 
SAD BECAUSE 
IT WILL BE A SAD DAY WHEN WE SEE THE NEXT SORT OF DOG GYM 
IT'S NOT AIMED AT THAT MARKET 
IN ORDER FOR DOGS TO REHABILITATE FROM ANY INJURY OR OPERATION 
THEY HAVE TO HAVE A CONTROLLED FORM OF EXERCISE 
SORRY I LOVE YOUR DOG HE'S LEANING VERY CASUALLY 
HE'S SO LAID BACK LOOK AT HIM HE'S JUST PLEASED IT'S OVER 
SO THIS IS FOR REHABILITATION YES 
SERIOUS TRAINING POTENTIALLY GUARD DOGS POLICE DOGS WHAT'S THAT MARKET SIZE 
OF THE ACTUAL PROFESSIONAL INDUSTRY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
AND THEN OVER THE U. K. THERE'S ABOUT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE THAT EITHER OWN OR WORK WITH DOGS 
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT MARKET DO YOU THINK YOU CAN TAP INTO 
ON MY PREDICTIONS IS BASICALLY THAT WE CAN BE SELLING SORT OF THREE HUNDRED UNITS A YEAR 
HOW MUCH PROFIT DO YOU MAKE PER UNIT 
IT'S RETAILING AT ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE AND I'M BUYING IN AT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY THEY DO THAT BLOWS MY MIND ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED ON A TREADMILL MM HMM 
I'M FLABBERGASTED I'M GOING TO PASS ON O. K. 
PETER JONES IS AMAZED BY THE THREE HUNDRED PER CENT MARK UP SAMMY IS MANAGING TO ACHIEVE ON HER TREADMILLS 
NOW JAMES CAAN WANTS TO KNOW WHERE SHE GOT HER INSPIRATION FOR THE INNOVATIVE PRODUCT 
SAMMY TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND HOW DID YOU GET INTO THIS 
WELL BASICALLY I'VE DONE A LOT OF DOG TRAINING FOR THE COMPETITION SIDE 
AND I WASN'T VERY WELL ONE SUMMER AND I HAD MY OWN HUMAN TREADMILL 
AND I NEEDED TO GET THE DOGS FIT FOR THE ONCOMING SEASON AND I PUT THEM ON IT 
I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW THEY LOVED IT AND THAT'S SORT OF WHERE I TOOK IT FROM 
AND THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SAMMY ARE YOU GOING TO USE ALL THAT IN STOCK 
NO BASICALLY THERE WILL BE SIXTY THOUSAND 
IT WILL BE TO BRING THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MACHINES IN 
THE REMAINDER IS FOR THE WORKING CAPITAL REQUIRED TO RUN THE COMPANY FOR SIX MONTHS 
I HAVE TO WORK 
I'VE GOT TWO KIDS ON MY OWN WHAT DO YOU DO 
I JUST WORK IN A PUB AT THE MOMENT AS A WAITRESS 
YOU'VE GOT A DAY JOB AS WELL YES 
SAMMY HAS IMPRESSED THE DRAGONS WITH HER DEDICATION IN GETTING THE PRODUCT TO MARKET 
BUT DEBORAH MEADEN WANTS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF HER FINANCES 
HELLO SAMMY I'M DEBORAH HI 
YOU'VE SOLD ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN OF THE PREVIOUS MODEL YES 
WHAT HAS THAT MEANT TO YOUR BUSINESS WHAT HAVE YOU TURNED OVER SO FAR 
WELL THE TURNOVER IS BASICALLY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND 
O. K. AND WHAT HAS THE PROFIT BEEN U. M. THIRTY EIGHT 
O. K. AND WHY CAN'T YOU FUND WHY CAN'T YOU 
I'VE BEEN TO THE BANKS AND THEY WERE TOTALLY 
YOU'VE GOT THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND OF PROFIT WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT 
TO DEVELOP THE NEW DESIGN 
DO YOU OWE THE BANK MONEY NOW NO 
AND HOW MANY ORDERS HAVE YOU GOT I'VE GOT TWENTY FOUR FROM 
FIRM WRITTEN ORDERS FIRM WRITTEN ORDERS YES 
AND YOU'VE BEEN TO YOUR BANK AND YOUR BANK HAVE SAID GO AWAY YES 
WELL I'M A SINGLE MUM WITH TWO KIDS O. K. AND I DON'T HAVE ANY ASSETS 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DIDN'T GIVE A DISCOUNT AGAINST THE TWENTY FOUR ORDERS YOU'VE GOT 
FOR A TWENTY FIVE PER CENT DEPOSIT TO A CUSTOMER 
BECAUSE THAT WOULD THEN FUND THE PURCHASE OF ALL THE PRODUCT 
SO THE BUSINESS COULD BE SELF FINANCING ANYWAY 
WELL I'VE ALREADY TAKEN THE ORDERS AND THE DEPOSITS O. K. AND THAT HAS HELPED TO PAY FOR THE TOOLING MOULDS 
O. K. SORRY I'M CONFUSED NOW 
YOU'VE SPENT THE DEPOSITS AS WELL 
NO I'VE GOT MONEY IN RESERVE BUT BECAUSE THE BANK SAID THAT THEY WERE BEHIND US O. K. 
AND THEY THEN PULLED OUT SAYING THEY WERE WISHY WASHY ABOUT IT ACTUALLY 
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THIS BANK THING I FEEL SLIGHTLY MISLED SAMMY 
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WELL ACTUALLY THE BANK DID OFFER TO LET ME TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
YOU JUST SAID THEY WON'T CAN YOU JUST COME CLEAN 
YEAH YEAH CAN YOU TELL US EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE BANK TELL ME WHAT THE BANK SAID 
MY BANK MANAGER WAS TOTALLY BEHIND US AND THEN THE BANK DECIDED NOT TO GO WITH IT 
THEY WILL LEND YOU THE MONEY AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT ASSETS TO GUARANTEE THAT MONEY BEHIND YOU 
SAMMY'S SHOCKING CONFESSION OF JUST HOW SERIOUS HER CASHFLOW PROBLEMS ARE 
HAVING FAILED TO GET A CASH INJECTION FROM THE BANK 
HAVE LEFT THE DRAGONS REELING AND HER PITCH IN REAL TROUBLE 
PETER JONES HAS HEARD ENOUGH 
IT ISN'T EASY AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE STARTING OUT WITH KIDS AS WELL IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH 
AND I THINK THAT'S ADMIRABLE BUT AS A BUSINESS I DON'T SEE IT SO I'M OUT 
SAMMY I COULDN'T INVEST IN SOMEBODY WHEN THEY'VE DONE A PRESENTATION 
WHERE HALFWAY THROUGH I'VE HAD TO SAY CAN YOU PLEASE COME CLEAN 
I UNDERSTAND YOUR SITUATION 
IF YOU'VE STOOD HERE AND SAID I'M IN DIRE STRAITS BUT I'VE GOT A GREAT PRODUCT 
IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE I LIKED THAT BUT I CAN'T INVEST IN IT 
AND WHAT WORRIES ME MOST IS YOUR REPUTATION'S SHOT 
YOU'VE ALREADY NOT DELIVERED TWENTY FOUR MACHINES SO I'M AFRAID I'M OUT O. K. 
IT'S A DISASTER FOR SAMMY HER BID FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS FADING FAST 
JAMES CAAN IS NEXT TO SAY WHERE HE STANDS 
I THINK A LOT OF YOUR EXPLANATION AND YOUR PRESENTATION DOES APPEAR TO HAVE A LOT OF HOLES 
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT TAKES AWAY FROM IS THERE A MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS PRODUCT 
AND ARE PEOPLE PREPARED TO BUY IT 
AND CLEARLY YOUR TRACK RECORD SHOWS THEY'LL PAY THE PRICE THAT YOUR GETTING 
SO I'M VERY TEMPTED TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER 
I'LL OFFER YOU THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 
BUT I THINK I'D WANT FIFTY PER CENT 
UNLIKE SOME OF HIS RIVALS 
JAMES CAAN CAN SEE ENOUGH POTENTIAL IN SAMMY'S POPULAR AND PROFITABLE TREADMILLS TO INVEST 
BUT ONLY IN RETURN FOR A SUBSTANTIAL STAKE IN THE BUSINESS 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE AND THEO PAPHITAS ARE STILL IN 
WILL EITHER OF THEM LAUNCH A COUNTER BID 
I THINK YOU SHOULD ACCEPT IT AND PUT YOUR HAND OUT AND WALK OVER TO HIM THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO 
BUT I'M OUT 
IT'S A GREAT OFFER BITE HIS ARM OFF I'M OUT AS WELL O. K. 
FOUR DRAGONS OUT BUT SAMMY STILL HAS ONE OFFER ON THE TABLE 
IT'S A DIFFICULT CHOICE 
SACRIFICE HALF HER COMPANY FOR JAMES CAAN'S ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INVESTMENT 
OR LEAVE THE DEN EMPTY HANDED AND CARRY ON GOING IT ALONE 
I THINK YOUR OFFER IS UM REASONABLE AND I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT YOUR OFFER 
WELL DONE JAMES 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
SAMMY FRENCH HAS PULLED HER PITCH BACK FROM THE BRINK OF FAILURE 
CONVINCING JAMES CAAN TO BACK HER AND HER INVENTION 
AND MOVING ONE STEP CLOSER TO REALISING HER BUSINESS DREAM 
WELL WELL WELL WELL YOU OLD DOG 
SAMMY YOU MUST BE FEELING RELIEVED 
SHOCKED REALLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL THAT IT WAS GOING THAT WAY AT ALL 
IT DIDN'T TAKE YOU LONG TO ACCEPT THE OFFER DID IT 
THE OTHER DRAGONS MADE CLEAR THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD OFFER DO YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD OFFER 
WITH THAT SORT OF EQUITY THAT HE'S TAKEN ON THE BUSINESS HE WILL DO HIS BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S WORKED 
WE'LL SEE HOW YOU GET ON WELL DONE THANK YOU 
IT'S UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE DEN 
THAT ENTREPRENEURS IN PURSUIT OF AN INVESTMENT CAN GRAB THE DRAGONS' ATTENTION WITH TASTY TREATS 
BUT SADLY THIS TACTIC DOESN'T ALWAYS GENERATE THE DESIRED RESULT 
FORMER SALES AND MARKETING DIRECTOR NEIL KELSALL FROM LANCASHIRE 
CAME TO THE DEN LOOKING FOR AN INVESTMENT IN HIS ETHICAL CHOCOLATE COFFEE AND SPICE ENTERPRISE 
HE WANTED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN RETURN FOR TEN PER CENT OF HIS BUSINESS 
MALAGASY LIMITED IS A COMPANY THAT PRODUCES FINE FOOD 
TOTALLY ENCAPSULATED FROM THE COUNTRY OF MADAGASCAR 
THE CHOCOLATE SWEETENED THE DRAGONS UP FOR A BIT 
BUT THE MOOD QUICKLY DARKENED WHEN DEBORAH MEADEN PROBED THE COMPANY'S FINANCES 
UP TO NOW WE'VE SOLD NINETY ONE THOUSAND WORTH WHAT WAS YOUR PROFIT OUT OF THAT NINETY ONE THOUSAND 
NET PROFIT WAS A LOSS OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND YOU'VE LOST ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND 
JAMES CAAN STRUGGLED TO MAKE SENSE OF THE COMPANY'S VALUATION 
JUST AMUSE ME AND TELL ME HOW YOU CAME UP WITH A VALUATION OF FIFTEEN MILLION 
BECAUSE 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK ACTUALLY NO 
AND PETER JONES WORRIED ABOUT THE BUSINESS'S FLAKY RETURNS 
YOU'RE DIGGING YOURSELF A BIG HOLE 
BECAUSE THERE'S NO RETURN INVESTMENT COMING BACK FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS 
WHEN IT DOES COME BACK AT THE END OF THE FOURTH YEAR IT'S SO PIECEMEAL IT'S AS GOOD AS A CHOCOLATE TEAPOT 
IN THE END IT WAS LEFT TO DUNCAN BANNATYNE TO BRING NEIL'S TIME IN THE DEN TO A BITING CONCLUSION 
I THINK YOU NEED TO GET SOME HELP YEAH WE WOULD LIKE TO NO YOU NEED HELP 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NEED HELP FROM AN INVESTOR OR A PSYCHIATRIST 
BUT THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT SO I'M OUT 
SIXTY PER CENT OF NEW BUSINESSES FAIL WITHIN THEIR FIRST THREE YEARS 
CAN OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEUR CONVINCE THE DRAGONS HE HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO BE IN THE MINORITY THAT SUCCEED 
MY NAME'S ANDREW SNEATH I'M AN INVENTOR AND ALSO THE OWNER OF HYDRODOME LIMITED 
I'M HERE TO RAISE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN EXCHANGE FOR TWENTY PER CENT OF THE COMPANY 
HYDRODOME PRESENTLY MANUFACTURES SUBMARINES FOR THE TOURIST INDUSTRY 
BUILDS AND RENTS UNDERWATER CAMERA VEHICLES 
CONSORTS ON DESIGN PROJECTS AND OPERATES ROBO SHARK PARTIES 
THE INVESTMENT WILL ENABLE US TO BUILD A VENUE WHICH WILL GIVE US THE POTENTIAL 
TO DIRECTLY MARKET THESE EXPERIENCES TO THE PUBLIC 
THIS FACILITY WOULD BE A THREE THOUSAND SQUARE METRE BUILDING WITH A FORTY M. DIAMETER TANK IN THE CENTRE 
THREE STOREYS HIGH 
A TANK OF THAT SCALE WOULD ENABLE US TO OFFER THIRTY SUBMARINE RIDES PER HOUR 
AND TEN SCUBA DIVING EXPERIENCES PER HOUR 
THESE TWO HOUR EXPERIENCES WILL INCLUDE HALF AN HOUR UNDERWATER BEING CHASED BY OUR SHARKS 
AND WOULD BE SOLD AT FORTY FIVE EACH 
IF WE ONLY OPERATED ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY FOR TEN HOURS EACH 
THAT WOULD BE A TOTAL INCOME OF EIGHTEEN MILLION 
WITH A GROSS PROFIT OF NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND A NET OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND 
I CAN SHOW YOU VIDEO OF THE SUBMARINES IN ACTION 
THIS IS HOW WE SET THEM UP FOR A TOURIST OPERATION WITH THE FLOAT AND LINE SO THE DEPTH IS CONTROLLED 
WITH THIS TYPE OF OPERATION WE ARE ABLE TO GIVE NON DIVERS A FIRST TIME UNDERWATER EXPERIENCE 
THIS IS FOOTAGE OF ROBO SHARK 
I WAS TRYING TO PROVE THAT ROBOTS REALLY COULD SURVIVE IN THE WILD 
SO WE MADE A DOCUMENTARY WITH DAVID ATTENBOROUGH 
THE GREAT WHITES DIDN'T TAKE KINDLY TO ROBO SHARK SWIMMING AROUND SEAL ISLAND IN SOUTH AFRICA 
AMAZINGLY ROBO SHARK ACTUALLY SURVIVED ALL OF THOSE ATTACKS 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS 
INVENTOR ANDREW SMEATH FROM BIRMINGHAM IS ASKING FOR A MASSIVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO BUILD THE HYDRODOME 
AN UNDERWATER ADVENTURE CENTRE FILLED WITH ROBOTIC SEA CREATURES 
IT'S AN AMBITIOUS PROPOSITION FOR THE DRAGONS BUT PETER JONES IS INTRIGUED BY THE MINI SUBMARINES 
ANDREW COULD YOU ACTUALLY GET ON THAT AND SHOW US WHAT IT'S LIKE I CAN DO GO ON 
CAN YOU HEAR ME YES I CAN 
HOW FAST DOES THAT GO IT GOES AT THREE KNOTS 
AND DOES IT ALWAYS STAY VERTICAL 
YES WE'VE BEEN OUT IN SIX FOOT SURF DRIVING AROUND AND IT'S FINE 
YOU'RE ASKING FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR BUSINESS GOING TO DO 
WHEN I DESIGNED BOB AND BUILD THE FIRST ONES PART OF THE PURPOSE WAS ACTUALLY TO GO TO FLORIDA BOB 
BREATHING OBSERVATION BUBBLE 
IN FLORIDA WE ENDED UP WITH OUR OWN RESEARCH FACILITY WITH AN OUTDOOR TANK NO I GET THE JOURNEY 
I WANT IN A NUTSHELL WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS 
MANUFACTURING AND RENTING UNIQUE UNDERWATER VEHICLES 
WE'VE JUST SECURED AN ORDER FOR SEVEN OF THE UNITS AT SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EACH 
SO IS THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO CREATE NEW UNDERWATER VEHICLES 
OR TO CAPITALISE ON THE EXISTING BUSINESS THAT YOU'VE CREATED 
IT'S USING THE VEHICLES THAT WE'VE ALREADY CREATED 
AND GIVING IT A LAND BASED ENVIRONMENT TO OFFER THESE RIDES TO THE PUBLIC IS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ENOUGH 
IT IS A THREE MILLION BUILDING BUT WITH THE DEVELOPERS THAT I'VE WORKED WITH IN THE MIDLANDS 
IT COMES DOWN TO THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AS A BACK UP ON THE RENT 
SO YOU WANT TO TAKE MY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THROW IT INTO A BUILDING TO RENT 
NO I'LL PUT IT IN THE BANK AND WORK WITH THE DEVELOPER TO BUILD THE FACILITY THAT WE NEED 
HAVE YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME UNDERWATER LATELY I'VE JUST COME BACK FROM THE SOUTH PACIFIC SO YES 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE VALUING A BUSINESS AT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AND THERE ISN'T A BUSINESS 
THE FIFTEEN MILLION WAS BASED ON NET PROFITS OF THE HYDRODOME IN THE FIRST YEAR 
BUT THE HYDRODOME'S NOT BUILT 
IT'S A BAD START ANDREW HAS HAD A REAL GRILLING FROM PETER JONES 
AND HE'S STRUGGLING TO GET THE DRAGONS TO SHARE HIS ENTHUSIASM FOR THE HYDRODOME 
THEO PAPHITAS DECIDES TO TRY ANOTHER TACK 
ANDREW I'M THEO COULD YOU I'M STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAID 
I'M STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING ELSE WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND 
WELL HND IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND THEN SEVEN YEARS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY 
LEARNING HOW TO BUILD THINGS 
I WANTED TO TRAVEL THE WORLD BUT ALSO MOVE INTO PRODUCT DESIGN SO I DECIDED TO DESIGN MY OWN PRODUCTS 
I BUILT THESE GOT THE COMPANY STARTED 
AND DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO SELL AND MOVE TO FLORIDA FOR TEN YEARS AND PURSUE MY DREAM 
SO THIS IS REALLY A LABOUR OF LOVE SEVENTEEN YEARS YEP 
AND NOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER DREAM 
NO IT'S THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF SETTING UP THESE RENTAL OPERATIONS 
SO WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO MAKE MONEY FROM THESE SUBMARINES 
BUT A LAND BASED FACILITY HAS ALL SORTS OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND SECONDARY INCOME STREAMS 
ANDREW IS CLEARLY AN EXPERT IN HIS FIELD 
AND HE'S CONVINCED THAT HIS UNDERWATER CONCEPT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE HUGE PROFITS IN THE U. K. 
DEBORAH MEADEN WHO HAS MADE HER FORTUNE IN THE TOURISM AND LEISURE INDUSTRY IS LOOKING LESS CONVINCED 
HELLO ANDREW I'M DEBORAH I FIND YOU SLIGHTLY OTHER WORLDLY 
I SENSE WE'RE ALL STRUGGLING WITH UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS COULD POSSIBLY TURN INTO A BUSINESS MODEL 
I MEAN WE SAW A LOVELY VIDEO HERE OF PEOPLE INSIDE THESE BUBBLES 
AND LOOKING AT STINGRAYS FLOATING PAST THEM AND FISH 
YOU ARE ACTUALLY CONSIDERING PUTTING THIS IN AN EMPTY TANK AREN'T YOU 
YES BUT WITH FULLY AUTONOMOUS ROBOT CREATURES I'M FINDING YOU MORE OTHER WORLDLY AS TIME GOES ON 
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK ARE GOING TO BE INTERESTED 
IN GETTING IN THIS AND JUST GLIDING AROUND AN EMPTY FISH TANK 
I THINK THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF DOING IT AND SEEING 
FIFTY PER CENT OF THE FUN IS DRIVING AROUND NO I'M INTERESTED SEEING WHAT 
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE TANK OTHER THAN WATER 
ANDREW IT'S LIKE SNORKELLING IN A SWIMMING POOL 
IT'S A STAGE BASICALLY YOU'VE GOT THIS GIANT WATER TANK AND THEN WITHIN THAT 
YOU PUT AUTONOMOUS ROBOT CREATURES THAT INTERACT WITH YOU AND CHANGE THEIR BODY COLOURS THEY'RE ROBOTIC 
SO ARE A LOT OF THE ATTRACTIONS IF YOU GO TO A DISNEY OR ANY OF THOSE THEY'RE ALL ROBOTIC 
YES BUT DISNEY HAVE A WHOLE RANGE OF ATTRACTIONS SO YOU'VE GOT A TOURIST FOOT FLOW 
YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT PEOPLE VISITING THAT SITE 
YOU'RE PUTTING THIS ISOLATED I THINK UNLESS YOU TELL ME IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A TOURISM ZONE 
IS IT IN A TOURISM ZONE NO SO IT'S NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF A TOURISM ZONE 
AND YOU'RE EXPECTING THIS TO ATTRACT ENOUGH PEOPLE TO TURN THIS INTO A VIABLE AND PROFITABLE BUSINESS 
IF I WERE YOU I WOULD ABANDON THAT IDEA AND TALK TO TOURIST ATTRACTIONS FOR SEA LIFE CENTRES 
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING WHO WERE VAGUELY INTERESTED IN THIS 
SO I'M AFRAID YOU PROBABLY GATHER WHAT AM ABOUT TO SAY NEXT I'M OUT 
DEBORAH MEADEN HAS WALKED AWAY FROM ANY DEAL AND ANDREW'S AMBITIOUS PITCH IS BEGINNING TO LOOK SHAKY 
BUT JAMES CAAN HAS SPOTTED SOMETHING THAT HIS RIVALS HAVE MISSED 
ANDREW HI MY NAME'S JAMES CAAN 
HI IS THERE MUCH OF A MARKET FOR THAT MACHINE IN HOLIDAY RESORTS LIKE SPAIN FRANCE AMERICA 
WELL THE ORDER FOR THE FIRST SEVEN ARE GOING TO THE RED SEA 
AND THE CLIENT THERE WANTS TO SET UP RENTAL OPERATIONS ALL THE WAY UP THE COAST 
AND I ACTUALLY HAVE LETTERS FROM HIM SAYING THAT HE WOULD LIKE TWO HUNDRED UNITS 
O. K. JUST REMIND ME THAT COST SIX THOUSAND 
SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND IT COSTS HOW MUCH TO MAKE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND I'LL HAVE IT BELOW TWO THOUSAND AFTER CHRISTMAS 
I'M JUST GOING TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR A SECOND ANDREW 
IF YOU WERE TO SET UP A SEPARATE COMPANY WHERE YOU PUT THIS PRODUCT INTO THAT SEPARATE COMPANY 
AND YOU WANTED TO DEVELOP THAT AS A THEME 
I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN BACKING YOU TO DO THAT 
WOULD THAT INTEREST YOU 
YES IT WOULD 
YES IT WOULD IF I ASKED YOU TO WRITE A BUSINESS PLAN 
TO SHOW ME WHAT THE FUTURE OPPORTUNITY OF THAT WOULD BE WHAT'S YOUR GUT FEELING 
MY TARGET NEXT YEAR IS TO SELL FIFTY UNITS I FEEL I CAN ACHIEVE THAT 
SO THAT WOULD MAKE YOU TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
YES SO THEN YOU WOULDN'T NEED THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
ONCE WE GOT THE BOBS INTO THAT SORT OF PRODUCTION LEVEL 
THE PROFITS WOULD ENABLE ME TO BUY MY OWN TANK SO I'LL GET THERE JUST ANOTHER WAY 
HAVING SEEN POTENTIAL IN THE ONE MAN SUBMARINES JAMES CAAN HAS DECLARED AN INTEREST 
BUT HE'S STOPPED SHORT OF MAKING AN OFFER IN THE HYDRODOME BUSINESS 
WILL THEO PAPHITAS BE PREPARED TO INVEST 
THIS IS A DREAM 
YOU NEED SOMEONE VERY WEALTHY THAT LIKES REMOTE CONTROLLED SHARKS 
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE NOT YET RIGHT 
WELL I'M NOT HIM THANK YOU 
SO I'M GOING TO DECLARE MYSELF OUT AND ALLOW THE OTHER DRAGONS TO FIGHT OVER THIS THANK YOU 
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I AM ANDREW I THINK REALLY HONESTLY YOU'RE IN CLOUD CUCKOO LAND 
THIS IS MILES AWAY FROM REALITY IT REALLY IS 
I THINK YOU HAVE TO RETHINK YOUR STRATEGY COMPLETELY 
SO I'M NOT GOING TO INVEST I'M OUT 
TWO MORE DRAGONS OUT IN AS MANY MINUTES AND ANDREW'S CHANCES OF INVESTMENT ARE FADING FAST 
PETER JONES IS READY TO HAVE HIS SAY 
O. K. ANDREW I THINK FROM A COMMERCIAL BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE THIS BUSINESS DOESN'T STACK UP 
BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU I REALLY REALLY LIKE THAT PRODUCT 
I COULD SEE THAT PRODUCT ABROAD LIKE YOU DESCRIBED ON THE VIDEO 
I'D LOVE TO GET IN ONE OF THOSE I THINK THAT LOOKS REALLY FUNKY VERY UNIQUE 
I HOPE YOU SEE YOUR DREAM THROUGH BUT IT'S NOT A DREAM THAT I'M GOING TO INVEST IN 
SO I'M OUT AS WELL CERTAINLY 
ANDREW'S LAST HOPE OF INVESTMENT NOW LIES WITH JAMES CAAN 
WHO HAS ALREADY EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE MINI SUBMARINES 
BUT CAN THE DRAGONS SEE ENOUGH POTENTIAL 
TO INVEST THE WHOLE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND MAKE ANDREW'S VISION A REALITY 
I'M DEFINITELY NOT CONVINCED THAT THERE IS A MARKET FOR PEOPLE IN BIRMINGHAM 
WHO WOULD GO TO A WATER TANK TO WATCH ROBOT SHARKS 
BUT I DO LIKE THIS BOB 
AND I THINK IF YOU HAD COME TO US TODAY WITH THAT PROPOSITION 
AND LOOKING FOR A MORE SENSIBLE NUMBER THAT I THINK AS AN INVESTOR HAS REAL APPEAL 
AND I THINK THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR A PROPOSITION THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN I'M OUT 
O. K. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IT'S ALL OVER FOR ANDREW 
UNABLE TO PERSUADE THE DRAGONS TO INVEST IN HIS UNDERWATER PROJECT HE LEAVES THE DEN EMPTY HANDED 
ENTREPRENEURS WHO DARE TO ENTER THE DEN ARE KEEN TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD 
SOME THINK THE KEY IS SIMPLY TO THINK BIG WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR PROPS 
BUT FOR THE DRAGONS BIGGER DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN BETTER 
TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD SAILING ENTHUSIAST ROWAN BROOK FROM PLYMOUTH 
ATTEMPTED TO IMPRESS THE DRAGONS WITH HIS INNOVATIVE PORTABLE BOAT 
THE MINICAT IS A SMALL LIGHTWEIGHT CATAMARAN THAT FOLDS UP AND PACKS INTO A BAG 
ROWAN WANTED A FIFTY THOUSAND INVESTMENT BUT THE DRAGONS WERE FAR FROM IMPRESSED BY THE CUT OF HIS JIB 
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD I'VE SOLD TWO PERSONALLY OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME 
OVER A YEAR YOU'VE SOLD TWO IN A YEAR 
AND YOU'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF ME CONVINCING ME YOU'RE GONNA SELL FORTY IN YEAR TWO IT'S NOT A BUSINESS 
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE ANY MONEY OUT OF THIS AND IF I GIVE YOU MY FIFTY THOUSAND 
I'LL SEE IT SAILING OFF SOMEWHERE NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN SO I'M AFRAID I'M OUT THANKS GUYS 
WELSH BASED BUSINESSWOMAN TANYA THOMAS BROUGHT HER PORTABLE SOFT TOY STUFFING MACHINE INTO THE DEN 
HOPING TO SECURE AN INVESTMENT OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND IN HER NOAH'S ARK FACTORY FRANCHISE BUSINESS 
THE CONCEPT IS NOVEL SPONTANEOUS AND FUN 
IT INVOLVES THE CHILD SELECTING AN ANIMAL AND THEN IT BRINGS IT TO LIFE 
BY BEING INVOLVED IN THE STUFFING OF THE ANIMAL AND ALSO GIVING IT A HEART BUT TANYA'S PITCH FELL FLAT 
YOU SEEM TO BE INTELLIGENT WHY CAN'T YOU SEE THAT THIS WON'T MAKE ANY MONEY IT'S BLATANTLY OBVIOUS 
BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE HOW I COULD MAKE ANY MONEY OUT OF IT I'M OUT 
SAM WRIGGLESWORTH FROM NORFOLK HAD MANAGED TO GET AN ASTON MARTIN G. T. SPORTS CAR INTO THE DEN 
HE WAS PITCHING FOR SIXTY THOUSAND FOR HIS COMPANY PRIMORIS 
AN EXCLUSIVE CLUB OFFERING CORPORATE RACING DAYS TO CITY HIGH FLYERS 
EVENTS LIKE THE F. I. A. WORLD G. T. CHAMPIONSHIP 
AND TWENTY FOUR HOUR LE MANS REPRESENT THE BEST WAY TO GET REALLY CLOSE TO MOTORSPORT ON CORPORATE DAYS 
BUT WHAT IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE THE CARS YOURSELF 
PRIMORIS WILL BE THE FIRST CLUB TO OFFER THIS AS AN EXPERIENCE 
I'M IMPRESSED THANK YOU BY THE FACT THAT YOU GOT THAT THING IN HERE YEAH IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE 
BUT THE ENTREPRENEUR'S STRUGGLE CONTINUED 
AS THE MULTI MILLIONAIRES SAW LITTLE POTENTIAL IN THE BUSINESS 
WHAT CONTRACTS HAVE YOU IN PLACE NOTHING WE'VE PLANS TO GO PLACES SO AT THE MOMENT IT'S AN IDEA 
PRETTY BLOODY BAD ONE AS WELL COME ON SAM IT'S RIDICULOUS IT'S ABSOLUTELY LUDICROUS 
FOR THAT REASON I'M OUT THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME 
SO FAR TONIGHT THE DRAGONS HAVE INVESTED IN ONE WOMAN AND HER DOG 
BUT WILL ANY OF THESE INTREPID ENTREPRENEURS 
PERSUADE THE MULTI MILLIONAIRES TO BACK THEIR IDEAS AND BUSINESSES 
YOU WILL BE TIED UP IN LITIGATION FOR SO LONG YOU WON'T HAVE TIME TO RUN YOUR BUSINESS 
YOU'RE MAD AS A FRUITCAKE YOU REALLY ARE 
I THINK YOU'VE COME IN ON A BIT OF A WING AND A PRAYER ACTUALLY 
ALGERIAN BORN MOTHER OF TWO HAFIDA SARACHI

JAMES CAAN HAS MADE MILLIONS OF HIS OWN BY FRANCHISING BUSINESSES AND WANTS MORE DETAILS 
HAFIDA HI I'M JAMES HI 
WHAT ARE THE SERVICES THAT YOU OFFER YOUR CUSTOMERS 
WHAT WE DO IS WE DO PAINTING AND DECORATING BUT ALSO WE DO WHERE THE FEMALE TOUCH COMES INTO PLACE IS 
WE DO PAINTING AND DECORATING BUT WE CREATE THE WOW FACTOR 
SO WE HAVE A MAKEOVER SERVICE AS WELL AND HELPING HAND WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO MOVE 
WE CALL IT A MOVING HOUSE ASSISTANT 
JUST LIKE A GENERAL HANDYMAN COME BUILDING TYPE SERVICE 
WHERE YOU WILL ADVERTISE I'LL CALL YOU'LL SEND SOMEBODY DOWN THEY'LL GIVE ME A QUOTE 
BUT THE UNIQUENESS OF YOUR PROPOSITION IS I GET A FEMALE TO DO IT RATHER THAN A MAN TO DO IT 
ABSOLUTELY AND THE CUSTOMER HAS THE CHOICE WHAT'S WRONG WITH MEN 
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MEN SO WHY NOT HAVE HANDYPEOPLE 
THE PROVISION OF HANDYGIRL REALLY IS TO PUT SOME OLD FASHIONED VALUES BACK INTO PROPERTY MAINTENANCE 
WHY CAN'T MEN DO THAT THEY CAN YOU SAID THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MEN 
NO THERE'S NOT BUT WHAT WE DO DIFFERENTLY IS THAT WE STICK TO OUR PROMISES AND MEN DON'T 
THE MAJORITY OF THEM DON'T NO MEN DON'T STICK TO THEIR PROMISES 
NOT ALL OF THEM THERE'D BE NO POINT IN ME PROMISING TO INVEST BECAUSE I WOULDN'T STICK TO THE PROMISE 
YOU ARE AN INVESTOR AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO YOU BEING ON BOARD 
I JUST DON'T SEE WHY IT'S GIRLS ONLY 
I JUST THINK IT'S SO SEXIST 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE HAS TAKEN UMBRAGE AT HAFIDA'S WOMEN ONLY ETHOS 
WILL THEO PAPHITAS SHARE HIS CONCERNS AS HE SEEKS ANSWERS ON THE COMPANY CREDENTIALS 
WHAT QUALIFICATIONS HAVE YOU GOT IN DOING SMALL BUILDING WORKS 
HAVE YOU DONE YOUR CITY AND GUILDS HAVE YOU DONE AN APPRENTICESHIP 
NO WE HAVEN'T BECAUSE THE TYPE OF WORK WE DO IS BASICALLY MINOR PAINTING AND DECORATING 
WELL HOLD ON HOLD ON YOU'VE JUST STOOD THERE 
AND YOU'VE MALIGNED EVERY MAN WHO DOES BUILDING WORK 
AS BEING PRETTY WELL USELESS AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE APPRENTICESHIPS 
WHO ARE SKILLED TRADESMEN WHO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AND HAVE GOT INTEGRITY 
AND NOW YOU HAVE PUT A T. SHIRT ON WITH HANDYGIRL HAVE GOT NO QUALIFICATIONS 
BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE A GIRL YOU THINK THAT ALLOWS YOU TO MALIGN EVERY BUILDER OUT THERE 
NO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY INSULTING ANYBODY 
YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB THEN I'M SORRY IF THIS IS THE CASE 
I'M TALKING ABOUT HANDYMEN NOT TRADESMEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE QUALIFICATION 
TO BE A HANDYGIRL YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO HAVE EXPERIENCE 
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PUTTING A BRUSH PAINTING AND DECORATING 
IT'S MORE THAN THAT DON'T HAVE A TRADESMAN COME IN HAVE A HANDYGIRL BECAUSE SHE'S NEARLY THERE 
SHE'S NEARLY AS GOOD AS HIM BUT SHE'S A GIRL SO THAT'S O. K. 
NO I HAD A DEALING WITH A LOCAL HANDYMAN 
HE MADE ME FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN MY OWN HOME 
WHAT I'M DOING NOW IS PROVIDING CUSTOMERS A CHOICE A SAFETY 
TO MAKE THEM FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN THEIR OWN HOME THAT'S MY OBJECTIVE 
MY COMPETITORS ARE THE LOCAL HANDYMEN NOT DIRECTLY THE TRADESMEN AT ALL SO THAT'S 
YOU NEED TO STOP TALKING AND YOU NEED TO LISTEN 
SURE YOU'RE GOING TO RECRUIT UNQUALIFIED PEOPLE TO DO BUILDING WORK AROUND THE COUNTRY 
IT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER 
YOU WILL BE TIED UP IN LITIGATION TROUBLE AND AGGRAVATION 
FOR SO LONG YOU WON'T HAVE TIME TO RUN YOUR BUSINESS THOSE ARE THE REASONS WHY I'M OUT 
HAFIDA HAS FAILED TO CONVINCE THEO PAPHITAS THAT HANDYGIRL IS WORTH BACKING AS A BRAND 
NOW PETER JONES DECIDES TO TEST OUT THE ENTREPRENEUR'S BUSINESS ACUMEN 
HAFIDA HI I'M PETER HI PETER 
HANDYGIRL YOU MENTIONED SINGLE FEMALE ELDERLY PEOPLE 
HOW MANY OF THAT IS YOUR TARGET MARKET HOW MANY PEOPLE IS THAT 
AT THE MOMENT WE'D BE FOCUSING IN THE REGION OF TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
AND HOW WILL YOUR FRANCHISE WORK WHAT WILL YOU DO THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM EVERYONE ELSE 
THE BEAUTY ABOUT HANDYGIRL IS THE ETHOS WE HAVE 
I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT MY BUSINESS I'LL TREAT YOUR HOME AS IF IT WAS MINE 
IT'D BE UNUSUAL TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO'D SAY I'LL SET UP A BUSINESS AND TREAT PEOPLE WITH DISRESPECT 
I'LL TRASH THEIR HOUSE AND DO THE WORST JOB I CAN 
EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME ETHOS AS YOU WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT'S DIFFERENT 
BASICALLY WE'LL BE LOOKING AFTER THE FRANCHISEE 
WERE GIVING THEM THE LEAD AND THEY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR TURNING THE LEAD INTO SALES O. K. 
HOW DO YOU GET THE LEADS THIS IS BRAND AWARENESS WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT 
BASICALLY WORKING WITH THE LOCAL MEDIA AND THE NATIONAL MEDIA WHAT WE DO IS 
HAFIDA JUST SLOW DOWN A BIT SURE TRY AND BE SPECIFIC 
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO WHAT IS BRAND AWARENESS TO YOU 
BRAND AWARENESS IS TELLING THE WORLD ABOUT HANDYGIRL BUT HOW YOU GOING TO DO THAT 
THROUGH SATISFIED CUSTOMERS WE DO THAT REFERRALS PUBLICITY 
HAFIDA IS STANDING HER GROUND 
BUT IS SHE DOING ENOUGH TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE REMAINING MULTI MILLIONAIRES 
HAFIDA HELLO I'M DEBORAH HI HI DEBORAH 
I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE WOMEN GOING INTO THE HOME THING 
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT'S FRANCHISE ABLE 
THE BUSINESS ETHOS WE HAVE AND THE WHOLE PROGRAMME THE SYSTEM 
WHERE PEOPLE WILL BE FOCUSED ON TAKING THE LEAD AND TURNING IT INTO SALES 
BUT THAT'S ANY WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THINKING 
HERE'S A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY I'LL ADVERTISE MYSELF AS A FEMALE WHO WILL GO INTO THE THINGY 
WHAT MAKES THIS FRANCHISE ABLE WHY WOULD THEY PAY YOU 
WHY WOULDN'T THEY JUST DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
AND THERE IS A FEW PEOPLE DOING THAT 
BUT I DO SELL MY BUSINESS AND I KNOW HOW TO SELL MY SERVICES YES BUT THAT'S YOU SELLING YOUR BUSINESS 
ONCE YOU FRANCHISE THAT YOU LOSE CONTROL OF THAT 
YOU'LL HAVE AN ARMY OF PEOPLE WITH THEIR OWN ETHOS DOING IT IN THEIR OWN WAY 
SOME WILL BE GOOD SOME WILL BE BLINKING AWFUL 
ONCE YOU START FRANCHISING YOUR MODEL YOU LOSE CONTROL OF THAT 
WELL AT THE MOMENT WHAT I DO IS I PROVIDE EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER 
NO THAT'S YOU I BET YOU'RE REALLY GOOD I'D HAVE YOU IN MY HOME 
YOU NO PROBLEM VERY CONSCIENTIOUS I BET YOU DO A FANTASTIC JOB 
WE'LL NOT CRITICISE YOU ON THAT GROUND ABSOLUTELY A PERSON LIVING IN PEMBROKESHIRE 
WHO'S DOING YOU'VE FRANCHISED OUT TO THEM YEAH 
THEY ARE REPRESENTING YOU AND YOUR FRANCHISE MODEL 
THEY DON'T CARE 
HOW DO YOU CONTROL THAT WELL WE'LL HAVE TO GO A STEP FURTHER 
AND GO TO THE PROCESS WHERE THEY WILL SHADOW ONE OF US TO SEE EXACTLY IF THEY APPLY WHAT THEY MEAN 
YOU DON'T THINK THAT MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY 
EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND IS GOING TO GET COMPLETE BRAND AWARENESS SET UP A TRAINING PROGRAMME 
AND SET UP A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SHADOW OTHER FRANCHISEES TO CHECK THE QUALITY OF THOSE FRANCHISES 
I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT'D TAKE A LOT MORE THAN EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND TO DO THE BRAND AWARENESS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 
I THINK YOU'RE GOOD YOU KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DOING EARN YOURSELF SOME GOOD MONEY OUT OF IT 
NOT A FRANCHISE ABLE MODEL FOR THAT REASON I'M OUT O. K. THANK YOU 
HAFIDA I REALLY THINK THAT YOU'VE JUST GOT SO MANY THINGS WRONG ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS MODEL 
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO AND CARRY ON YOUR OWN 
YOU'LL NEVER MAKE A FRANCHISE OUT OF THIS YOU WON'T MAKE A BIG BUSINESS OUT OF IT SO I'M OUT 
THE DRAGONS MIGHT LIKE HAFIDA AS AN INDIVIDUAL 
BUT THEY DON'T THINK HER BUSINESS IS SCALABLE SHE'S RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS 
ONLY JAMES CAAN AND DUNCAN BANNATYNE NOW STAND BETWEEN HER AND FAILURE IN THE DEN 
HAFIDA LET ME DO YOU FAVOUR SURE I'VE BUILT A FRANCHISE BUSINESS 
IN THIRTY COUNTRIES AND I THINK DEBORAH'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
YOUR EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM IS BECAUSE OF YOU 
BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB YOU BELIEVE IN IT 
BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT YOU YOURSELF CAN BE REPLICATED ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
SO THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THIS WILL NOT WORK 
FOR THAT REASON I DON'T THINK I CAN INVEST IN THIS I'M OUT 
O. K. THANK YOU 
EM YOU'VE VALUED YOUR COMPANY AT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND PRE MONEY RAISING 
I VALUE IT AT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND LESS THAN THAT ABOUT NOTHING 
FOR THAT REASON I'M OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU 
THE HANDYGIRL MANAGED TO CONVINCE THE DRAGONS OF HER PERSONAL SKILLS 
BUT FAILED TO GET AN INVESTMENT TO FRANCHISE HER BUSINESS AND SHE LEAVES THE DEN WITH NOTHING 
FOR THE MAJORITY OF ENTREPRENEURS WHO ENTER THE DEN ONE ENCOUNTER WITH THE DRAGONS IS ENOUGH 
BUT OCCASIONALLY AN IRREPRESSIBLE OPTIMIST WILL TRY AGAIN 
LIKE HAMPSHIRE BASED INVENTOR ROARK MCMASTER WHO CAME TO THE DEN LAST YEAR 
LOOKING FOR FIFTY THOUSAND TO FUND THE KITCHEN GADGET HE HAD INVENTED 
THE Q. TOP IS DESIGNED TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT A CUCUMBER OR A SAUSAGE OR A LEMON IN THE HOME 
WHEN YOU CHOP REMEMBER Q. TOP 
THEO PAPHITAS THOUGHT THE DESIGN WAS REMINISCENT OF A RATHER DIFFERENT TYPE OF PRODUCT 
THIS LOOKS LIKE A CONDOM FOR A CUCUMBER 
YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THE CONDOM IS A VALID ONE IS IT 
IT SERVES TO SUBSTANTIATE THE INTRINSIC VALUE THE PEOPLE PLACE UPON THIS SEXY LOOKING PRODUCT 
LET'S NOT HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT A CONDOM 
ALTHOUGH ROARK PITCHED WITH PASSION THEY WEREN'T CONVINCED I THINK IT'S CRAZY 
I HOPE YOU WON'T WASTE ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME OR YOUR LIFE ON IT 
I'M JUST COMPLETELY UNCONVINCED THAT THIS IS SELLABLE SO FOR THAT REASON I'M OUT 
HOWEVER IT WASN'T A TOTAL DISASTER AS ROARK DID WALK AWAY WITH SOMETHING 
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER GOING TO MAKE IT WITH THIS PRODUCT O. K. 
AND IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT WITH THIS PRODUCT I'D LIKE YOU TO GIVE ME A CALL 
BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO GIVE YOU A JOB O. K. THANK YOU 
ROARK NEVER DID TAKE PETER JONES UP ON HIS JOB OFFER BUT HE DID MAKE A TRIP BACK TO THE DEN 
THIS TIME ASKING FOR A SIXTY THOUSAND INVESTMENT IN HIS LATEST INVENTION A PORTABLE SOLAR CHARGING DEVICE 
THE MAXSTRAP IS IDEALLY DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE THAT SPEND TIME IN THE OUTDOORS 
THE SOLAR CELLS COLLECT ENERGY AND DEPOSIT THE ENERGY IN A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY WITHIN THE LITTLE POUCH HERE 
SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE OUT ON THE GO THEY DON'T HAVE TO FIND A CHARGING SOURCE 
TO CHARGE UP THEIR PHONE OR THEIR IPOD 
THE SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR LEFT THEO PAPHITAS UTTERLY STUMPED 
HAVE YOU ACTUALLY GOT AN ORDER FROM ANYBODY FOR THIS 
NO WE DON'T BUT WE HAVE HAD INTEREST FROM A FEW COMPANIES U. S. A. CHINA EUROPE A LOT FROM GERMANY 
WHY IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE USED FOR PEOPLE IN DISTRESSING SITUATIONS THAT NEEDED EMERGENCY POWER 
WELL I'M IN A DISTRESSED SITUATION NOW 
AND ROARK DID LITTLE TO RELIEVE THE DISTRESS OF THE OTHER DRAGONS 
WHEN YOU DESIGNED THIS DID IT NOT OCCUR TO YOU THAT I'M OVER ENGINEERING A SOLUTION HERE 
CAN I CORRECT THE OVER ENGINEERING HE'S DONE THE OPPOSITE HE'S UNDER ENGINEERED IT 
I THINK THAT'S MY POINT YOU'RE MAD AS A FRUITCAKE YOU REALLY ARE 
BUT PETER JONES FINALLY STEPPED IN TO ONCE AGAIN DEFEND THE OVER OPTIMISTIC SALESMAN 
ROARK I TOTALLY TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH DUNCAN 
YOU'RE NOT AS MAD AS A FRUITCAKE 
YOU ARE A LITTLE RAY OF LIGHT YOU'RE A SALESMEN 
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHEN A PRODUCT IS GOOD 
AND I CAN'T INVEST IN THIS BUT FINAL OFFER 
I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU COME AND WORK WITH ME SO I'M OUT THANK YOU 
DON'T FORGET I'M OFFERING YOU SIXTY THOUSAND FOR ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT TA 
AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ENTREPRENEURS ARE COMING TO THE DEN 
CLAIMING ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BUSINESS IDEAS BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO PROVE THEY CAN MAKE MONEY 
JERRY MANTALVANOS AND PAUL MERKER FROM LANCASHIRE 
THINK THEY FIT THE BILL AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INVESTMENT 
HELLO MY NAME IS JERRY MANTALVANOS AND THIS IS PAUL MERKER AND WE ARE J. P. M. ECO LOGISTICS 
WE ARE HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INVESTMENT FOR TWENTY PER CENT SHARE OF OUR BUSINESS 
MAY I START BY SAYING THAT MYSELF AND PAUL HAVE OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS' EXPERIENCE IN THE HAULAGE INDUSTRY 
RANGING FROM DRIVING TO TRAINING TO MANAGEMENT 
IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME WE HAVE MADE NUMEROUS CONTACTS THAT WE FEEL WILL BE USEFUL TO J. P. M. 
BUT WHAT IS J. P. M. 
J. P. M. ECO LOGISTICS IS UNIQUE BECAUSE IT WILL BE 
THE FIRST TRULY ECO FRIENDLY HAULAGE COMPANY IN THE U. K. 
WE HAVE ALREADY ATTAINED A MAJOR CONTRACT WITH ONE OF EUROPE'S LEADING MANUFACTURERS OF WASTE 
SKIPS AND CONTAINERS AND ARE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF NEGOTIATING WITH SEVERAL BLUE CHIP COMPANIES 
I WILL NOW PASS YOU OVER TO MR. PAUL MERKER WHO WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHY J. P. M. IS SO UNIQUE 
WE'RE AIMING TO ACHIEVE THIS BY USING VEHICLES THAT ARE MADE FROM NINETY EIGHT PER CENT PLUS RECYCLABLE PARTS 
WE WILL BE USING ONE HUNDRED PER CENT BIODIESEL 
THE BENEFITS OF BIODIESEL NO GREENHOUSE GASES HENCE NO GLOBAL WARMING 
WE'RE LOOKING AT USING THE INVESTMENT FROM YOU 
TO PUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOWN ON PREMISES 
AND THE OTHER FIFTY THOUSAND TO ACQUIRE VEHICLES AND FOR OUR DIESEL 
WE'D LIKE YOU TO INVEST WITH J. P. M. ECO LOGISTICS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OUR COMPANY 
IS GOING TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL AND HAVE VERY RAPID GROWTH BECAUSE J. P. M. IS THE FUTURE THANK YOU 
ROCHDALE BASED LOGISTICS MANAGER JERRY MANTALVANOS AND LORRY DRIVER PAUL MERKER 
ARE ASKING THE DRAGONS TO INVEST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THEIR ECO FRIENDLY U. K. HAULAGE COMPANY 
IN RETURN THEY'RE OFFERING A TWENTY PER CENT STAKE OF THE BUSINESS 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE IS KEEN TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THEIR OPERATION 
JERRY PAUL HOW DO YOU GET A LORRY WHERE ALL THE PARTS ARE RECYCLABLE 
THE MANUFACTURER AND WHO MANUFACTURES THEM 
SCANIA OF SWEDEN AND DO YOU BOTH DRIVE ONE OF THESE LORRIES AT WORK 
PAUL IS A DRIVER AND TRADER WHAT DO YOU DO JERRY SIT AT HOME WATCHING TELLY I'M A LOGISTICS MANAGER 
HOW DID YOU START TRADING DID YOU PUT SOME MONEY IN YES WE'VE BOTH REMORTGAGED OUR HOUSE 
SO WHAT DID YOU PUT IN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EACH SO THERE'S FIFTY THOUSAND IN THIS COMPANY CORRECT 
SO IS THIS COMPANY MAKING MONEY AT THE MOMENT 
YES DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT 
YES WITHOUT EVEN A VEHICLE WE'VE MADE A TURNOVER OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND LAST MONTH 
WE ALREADY OBTAINED A CONTRACT WORTH JUST UNDER HALF A MILLION POUNDS O. K. 
WHAT'S YOUR PROJECTED TURNOVER FOR THE FIRST YEAR YES WE'VE WORKED IT ON THIS ONE CONTRACT 
WITHOUT ANY RETURN LOADS JUST ONE WAY RUNS WHICH WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
SO WHAT WOULD THE PROFIT BE ON FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TURNOVER 
ONE HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIX 
ONE HUNDRED SIX YES 
J. P. M. ECO LOGISTICS MIGHT BE A FLEDGING COMPANY 
BUT WITH CONFIDENT PROFIT PROJECTIONS BACKED UP WITH A STRONG ORDER BOOK 
IT'S LEFT THE DRAGONS PUZZLED 
IF YOU HAVE AN ORDER YES WE HAVE OF FOUR HUNDRED ZERO WORTH OF HAULAGE 
WHY DO YOU NEED AN INVESTOR WE FEEL THE COMPANY WILL GROW RAPIDLY 
AND WITH YOUR INVESTMENT AND ALSO WITH YOUR BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE 
I THINK WE COULD COPE WITH THAT GROWTH 
SO REALLY ALL YOU WANT HERE IS SOMEBODY HERE TO MENTOR YOU 
NO WHO COULD TAKE US THAT BIT FURTHER THAN WE THINK WE CAN GO BY OURSELVES 
TO HELP US OPEN DOORS I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S GOT AN HGV LICENCE HERE 
NO BUT LIKE YOURSELF YOU'VE GOT A RETAIL COMPANY THAT USES HAULAGE ALL THE TIME 
SO THERE COULD BE OPPORTUNITY THERE 
O. K. 
JERRY AND PAUL ARE STANDING UP WELL TO THE DRAGONS' SCRUTINY 
BUT PETER JONES IS ABOUT TO TURN UP THE PRESSURE 
GUYS HELLO I'M PETER HELLO PETER I NEED TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE BUSINESS 
BECAUSE I GET THIS FEELING THAT THIS ECO FRIENDLY SORT OF PIECE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A RED HERRING 
YOU'RE TRYING TO BE DIFFERENT IN THE MARKET BY SAYING YOU'RE ECO FRIENDLY 
BUT IF I OWN A HAULAGE COMPANY NOW CALLED PETER LOGISTICS 
AND I WANT TO CHANGE MY FLEET OF EIGHTY LORRIES WITH MY HUGE CONTRACTS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY 
WITH MY FANTASTIC CONTACTS I COULD DO THAT TOMORROW 
COMPANIES WILL MOVE THAT WAY WE HOPE THEY DO BECAUSE IT'LL MAKE THINGS A LOT BETTER FOR EVERYBODY 
WHY WOULD IT MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR YOUR BUSINESS OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO CHANGE THE WAY HAULAGE IS PERCEIVED 
AS BEING THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO GLOBAL WARMING 
HOW MUCH BUSINESS IS THERE OUT THERE WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS 
WHEN PETER STARTS HIS PETER LOGISTICS COMPANY 
AND THEN I START BANNATYNE LOGISTICS WHICH WILL HAVE BIGGER CLEANER AND SHINIER TRUCKS THAN PETER'S 
WILL THERE BE ANY BUSINESS LEFT FOR YOU TWO YES THERE'S PLENTY TO GO ROUND YES PLENTY 
THE DUO ARE REFUSING TO BE RATTLED BY THE DRAGONS' INTERROGATION 
JAMES CAAN WANTS TO DIG DOWN DEEPER INTO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIALS 
I'M QUITE INTERESTED IN THE CONCEPT OF GREEN AND I THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH IT'S VERY EASY TO REPLICATE 
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE THE FIRST GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE 
SO IF YOU REALLY PUSH YOURSELF WHAT YOU THINK YOU COULD GENERATE IN TERMS OF ORDERS 
ONE OF THE CONTRACTS THAT WE'VE WON ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO TO THREE MILLION CONTRACTS 
SO IT COULD BE PHENOMENAL WHAT SORT OF MARGIN DO YOU MAKE ON 
ABOUT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PER CENT DEPENDING ON WHO THE CUSTOMER IS SO WITH A BIT OF PUSH 
WITH A VERY DYNAMIC DRAGON BEHIND YOU IT SOUNDS LIKE A BUSINESS THAT COULD MAKE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
I CAN SEE A BIG OPPORTUNITY HERE 
I THINK THAT THE MARKET ABSOLUTELY IS VERY SENSITIVE TO WHAT YOU'RE OFFERING TODAY 
I THINK ON THAT BASIS I PROBABLY WOULD BE QUITE INTERESTED ON MAKING YOU AN OFFER 
I THINK I'D PUT UP HALF THE MONEY 
AND I THINK IT WOULD NEED TO BE FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
TEMPTED BY THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL PROFITS 
JAMES CAAN HAS OFFERED JERRY AND PETER HALF THE MONEY THEY'RE AFTER 
BUT UNDER DEN RULES THE ENTREPRENEURS NEED TO SECURE ALL THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THEY CAME FOR 
OR THEY LEAVE EMPTY HANDED 
WILL ANY OF THE OTHER DRAGONS MATCH JAMES CAAN'S OFFER 
O. K. LOOK JERRY AND PAUL JUST TO GET THINGS MOVING 
I LIKE THE TWO OF YOU AND I WOULD MATCH JAMES'S OFFER 
SO I WOULD ALSO OFFER YOU FIFTY THOUSAND FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
SO THAT MEANS EFFECTIVELY YOU'VE BEEN OFFERED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR FORTY FIVE PER CENT 
THE DUO HAVE THEIR OFFER FOR THE TOTAL AMOUNT BUT IT COMES AT A HIGH PRICE 
THEY'D HAVE TO GIVE UP NEARLY HALF OF THEIR BUSINESS IN RETURN 
NOW THEY NEED ONE OF THE REMAINING THREE DRAGONS TO IMPROVE ON IT IN AN ATTEMPT TO CLINCH THE DEAL 
GUYS LET ME TELL YOU WHERE I AM SO YOU CAN MAKE YOUR MINDS UP QUICKLY 
I ALREADY HAVE A FLEET OF TRUCKS SO I UNDERSTAND IT 
NOW YOU'RE USING BIO FUEL BIODIESEL 
THAT'S GREAT AND I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD BE SO THAT'S FANTASTIC 
YOU TWO I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I DO LIKE YOU 
I LIKE YOUR COMMITMENT YOU'RE DOWN TO EARTH 
YOU GIVE STRAIGHT ANSWERS 
SO BECAUSE I THINK IT COMPLEMENTS SOMETHING I'M ALREADY DOING 
AND I'VE GOT LORRIES GOING UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY 
I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER 
AND MY OFFER IS 
I'LL GIVE YOU FIFTY THOUSAND WHICH IS HALF 
ALL I WANT IS TWENTY PER CENT 
I'D ECHO WHAT THEO SAID I LIKE THE BOTH OF YOU YOU SEEM PRETTY STRAIGHT 
YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF A CONTRACT FOR THREE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD IT'S A GREAT START 
IT'S A GREAT START AND WITH GUIDANCE I SUSPECT YOU WILL GO PLACES 
SO I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER 
I'M GOING TO SAY I WILL GIVE YOU FIFTY THOUSAND FOR TWENTY PER CENT OF THE BUSINESS 
SUPERB 
THEO PAPHITAS AND DEBORAH MEADEN HAVE UNDERCUT THEIR RIVAL DRAGONS' EQUITY DEMAND BY FIVE PER CENT 
THE ONLY DRAGON LEFT TO DECLARE HIS HAND IS PETER JONES IS HE WILLING TO ENTER THE BIDDING WAR 
I AM TOTALLY TOTALLY STUNNED 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE GOT FOUR OFFERS FROM FOUR DRAGONS 
IT'S A TRUCK WITH A BIODIESEL FILTER ON IT 
IT'S A TRUCK THAT'LL RUN ON ONE HUNDRED PER CENT BIODIESEL AND WE'RE THE FIRST COMPANY USING IT 
I THINK YOU'VE COME IN ON A WING AND A PRAYER ACTUALLY 
YOU'RE A HAULAGE COMPANY NO WE'RE NOT COMING IN ON A WING AND A PRAYER 
WE'VE GOT PEOPLE WAITING FOR US TO GET OUR OWN VEHICLES ON THE ROAD AND THEY WANT TO USE US 
YOU HAVE FOUR OFFERS FROM FOUR DRAGONS AND I THINK YOU'VE DONE AMAZINGLY WELL 
THANK YOU SO I'M GOING TO SAY GOOD LUCK TO YOU BUT IT'S NOT FOR ME SO I'M OUT 
IT'S CRUNCH TIME FOR JERRY AND PAUL 
JAMES CAAN AND DUNCAN BANNATYNE WANT A FORTY FIVE PER CENT STAKE IN THE COMPANY 
THEO PAPHITAS AND DEBORAH MEADEN ARE INSISTING ON JUST FIVE PER CENT LESS 
CAN THE DUO TURN THE TABLES ON THE COMPETING DRAGONS AND NEGOTIATE ONE CAMP DOWN ON THEIR EQUITY DEMAND 
I DON'T WANT TO LET FORTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE SHARES GO 
I'D LIKE ME AND JERRY TO KEEP AT LEAST THIRTY PER CENT OF THE SHARES EACH IN THE COMPANY 
BECAUSE IT'S OUR COMPANY 
I'M NOT GOING TO MOVE FROM FORTY FIVE 
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER 
BUT IT'S YOUR CALL 
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO TO FORTY FIVE I DON'T KNOW HOW JERRY FEELS PERSONALLY 
I'M HAPPY WITH THE THEO DEAL 
SO HAVE WE GOT A DEAL YES WE HAVE GOT A DEAL WELL DONE GUYS WELL DONE 
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
JERRY AND PAUL HAVE DONE IT IN THE END AGREEING THAT IT WAS WORTH GIVING UP FORTY PER CENT OF THEIR COMPANY 
TO WIN THE MONEY AND EXPERTISE OF DEBORAH MEADEN AND THEO PAPHITAS 
GERRY PAUL WELL DONE YOU'RE LOOKING A BIT PUNCH DRUNK BUT YOU CAN SMILE NOW 
YOU MUST BE FEELING QUITE PLEASED 
YES IT'S A BIT SURREAL I'M A BIT KNACKERED AS WE SAY IN ROCHDALE 
VERY PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOME 
NOW GUYS YOU DIDN'T NEGOTIATE VERY HARD 
YOU WENT FROM FORTY FIVE STRAIGHT TO FORTY YET YOU HAD FOUR OFFERS 
I WONDER IF YOU COULD HAVE DONE A BIT MORE 
WE PROBABLY COULD BUT WE WEREN'T EXPECTING FOUR OFFERS 
WE TALKED BEFORE THAT WAS WHAT WE AGREED IF THEO CAME ON BOARD 
SO YOU'RE FEELING PLEASED VERY PLEASED VERY TIRED VERY DRAINED 
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMPETITION FROM DUNCAN 
GO AND FILL UP WITH SOME BIODIESEL AND WE WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS 
NEXT TIME ON DRAGONS' DEN DEBORAH MEADEN IS UNCONVINCED BY ONE ENTREPRENEUR 
I JUST HAVE A SAYING IF SOMETHING LOOKS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT'S GENERALLY TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE 
AND DUNCAN BANNATYNE GETS HOT ON HEALTH AND SAFETY 
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS THING IS DANGEROUS 
IT REALLY IS
