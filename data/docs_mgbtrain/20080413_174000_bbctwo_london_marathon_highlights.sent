WOODS FROM GREAT BRITAIN THE 
DEFENDING CHAMPION OF COURSE JUST 
AS DAVID WEIR IS IN THE MEN'S RACE 
THIS IS WHERE THE MEN CRASHED 
BEFORE BEFORE SANDRA GRAF SHELLY WOODS AND 
AMANDA MCGRORY SAFELY THROUGH THIS 
TIME TIME THE MEN HAVE SET OFF AT A SUPERFAST 
PACE THE PACEMAKERS IN THE BLACK 
AND WHITE STRIPS DOING THEIR JOB 
THEY HAVE BONE THE LEADERS DOWN A 
SMALL GROUP OF SEVEN OR EIGHT 
ATHLETES ATHLETES WELL YOU KNOW THERE SHOULD 
ABPRIZE FOR DREAMING UP THE 
SILLIEST WAY OF GETTING AROUND THE 
MARATHON COURSE BATMAN AND ROBIN 
HAVE LEFT THE BAT MOBILE AND THERE 
THEY ARE 
AND LAST YEAR IT TOOK SEVEN DAYS 
FOR A MAN IN AN OLD DIVING SUIT TO 
COMPLETE THE MARATHON I WONDER HOW 
LONG IT WILL TAKE HIM AND THE 
LEADING PACK OF WHEELCHAIR RACERS 
STILL CONTAINS DAVID WEIR THE 
WOMEN ARE APPROACHING TOWER BRIDGE 
THERE IT IS 
CONSTANTINA TOMESCU DITA LEADING 
FROM IRINA MIKITENKO 
BERHANE ADERE JUST BEHIND THEM 
GETE W. A. M. I. ONE OF THE PRE RACE 
FAVOURITES LIZ YELLING IN 
CONTENTION IN THE LEADING POSITION 
FOR THE PLACE FOR BEIJING FOR THE 
BRITISH WOMEN'S TEAM CHASED BY 
HAYLEY HAINING RUNNING STRONGLY 
BEHIND AND CATCHING AT SOME POINTS 
A REAL SCRAP GOING ON IN THE 
WOMEN'S RACE FOR THAT ONE PLACE 
AVAILABLE FOR THE BRITISH WOMEN 
THE MEN'S RACE THEY ARE GOING SO 
QUICKLY THEY REALLY HAVE STORMED 
THROUGH THE FIRST SEVEN MILES AND 
ALL THE BIG NAMES THERE MARTIN LEL 
DEFENDING HIS TITLE FELIX LIMO A 
FORM ERWINER RYAN HALL FROM

MIKITENKO FROM GERMANY IN ONLY HER 
SECOND EVER RACE THESE TWO WON IN 
BERLIN LAST YEAR BEHIND THEM THE 
CHICAGO WINNER FROM LAST YEAR 
THESE THREE ARE GOING REALLY WELL 
IN CANARY WHARF THIS RACE IS REALLY 
HOTTING UP NOW STILL DAVID WEIR 
JUST LOOKING AROUND AT ERNST VAN 
DYKE DYKE HE IS ASKING FOR A BIT OF HELP BUT 
THE NUMBER MAN IN THE WORLD IN A 
GREAT POSITION 
THIS IS INTERESTING THE GAP IS 
CLOSING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MILES 
BETWEEN LIZ YELLING AND HAYLEY 
HAINING BUT IS LIZ YELLING FAILING 
A LITTLE BIT CERTAINLY HAYLEY 
HAINING CAN SEE LIZ YELLING BUT IS 
LIZ AWARE THAT HAYLEY IS CHASING 
WELL THEY HAVE A GOOD FEW MILES TO 
GO YET THEY SEEM IN VERY GOOD 
SPIRITS AS THEY SHOULD BE AT THIS 
EARLY STAGE THAT IS THE GAP THERE THE LEAD WOMEN HERE NOW A FALL 
THERE IT LOOKS LIKE GETE W. A. M. I. ONE 
OF THE PRE RACE FAVOURITES ALSO 
AIT SALEM THE LEADER NOW 
REALISES THERE HAS BEEN A FALL 
BEHIND HER AND BEGINS TO STRETCH 
THE PACE CAN GETE W. A. M. I. GET IN 
CONTENTION AGAIN 
THIS IS SUPER 
FAST RUNNING BY THE MEN THEY ARE 
AT A WORD RECORD PACE THAT IS 
REMARKABLE THAT IS WHY THERE IS 
JUST A SMALL GROUP THERE THIS IS 
THE GROUP THE THIRD CHASING GROUP 
IT CONTAINS TOMAS ABYU AND DAN 
ROBINSON THE TWO ARE PRETTY MUCH 
LOCKED TOGETHER AS THEY APPROACH 
THE HALF WAY 
AND IN THE RED AND WHITE VEST IS 
GETE W. A. M. I. SHE HAD FALL SHE IS 
HAVING PROBLEM WITH HER THIGH 
HOPEFULLY BACK IN CONTENTION THE 
MEN'S LEAD GROUP IS OPERATING AT 
ALMOST WORLD PACE THIS IS A BIG 
GROUP HERE AND FAST TIME DAN ROBINSON JUST HAS THE ADVANTAGE 
OVER TOMAS ABYU AT HALF WAY HE HAD 
TO TAKE THE HIGH RISK STRATEGY AND 
GO WITH THE PAST FAST PACE BUT HE 
MAY PAY FOR THAT LATER 
AND LEADING THEM NOW WITH THE 
WHEELCHAIRS IT IS HEADS DOWN AND 
ARMS PUMPING THE BEST SPRINTER OF 
ALL IS COMING AWAY DAVID WEIR HE 
IS ABSOLUTELY FLYING CHASED BY 
KIRK FERNLY THE AUSTRALIAN IN 
SECOND SECOND WHAT A ABOUT THAT CRASH TWENTY FIVE METRES 
FROM THE FINISH CERTAINLY ONE OF 
THEM WAS ERNST VAN DYKE THERE HE 
IS I THINK THAT THE OTHER WAS 
JOSHUA GEORGE OF THE UNITED STATES 
REAL DRAMA 
DAVID WEIR IS OUTSIDE OF HIS COURSE 
RECORD HE BECOMES THE FIRST MAN 
EVER TO WIN THE WHEELCHAIR MARATHON 
THREE TIMES IN A ROW 
IN THE SPACE OF A FEW METRES 
JOSHUA GEORGE ERNST VAN DYKE 
THEIR ASPIRATIONS CAME TO AN END IN 
A BIT OF DRAMA 
MY GOODNESS 
IRINA MIKITENKO OF GERMANY REALLY 
KEEN TO GET ON WITH THE RACE NOW 
ONLY HER SECOND EVER MARATHON ON 
THE INSIDE THE TINY FIGURE OF GETE 
W. A. M. I. THERE WE ARE LOOKING AT LIZ

INTO FIVE THE PACEMAKE VERSE GONE 
IT IS ALL ABOUT WINNING THE RACE 
NOW THE CONDITIONS I WOULD NOT 
SAY THEY HAVE DETERIORATED BUT THE 
RAIN CLOUDS ARE GATHERING TOWARDS 
THE FINISH OTHERWISE THE 
CONDITIONS ARE STILL VERY GOOD 
SANDRA GRAF OF SWITZERLAND IN 
TERRIBLE CONDITIONS IT IS THE LAST 
PART OF THE COURSE SHE IS LEADING 
BY A LONG LONG WAY THE COMPETITOR 
BEHIND HER IS GREAT BRITAIN'S TISHA 
PATTEL BUT SANDRA GRAF WINS IT 
IT BEATS THE COURSE THAT WAS SET 
BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN SANDRA GRAF IS THE 
CHAMPION CHAMPION IRINA MIKITENKO REALLY NOT BOTHERED 
BY THE RAIN AT ALL SHE IS GRIM 
AREASING BUT THAT GAP IS GROWING 
SVETLANA ZAKHAROVA IS BEHIND HER 
GETE W. A. M. I. LOOKS AS THOUGH HER 
CHANCES ARE DISAPPEARING AND BACK 
WITH THE MEN THERE IS NO LETTING UP 
IN TERMS WITH THE PACE 
SAMMY WANJIRU IS THERE COMFORTABLE 
THE PACE NOT SLOWING 
IRINA MIKITENKO LOOKING REALLY 
STRONG NOW SVETLANA ZAKHAROVA IN

SECOND IN THE LONDON MARATHON 
PREVIOUSLY IT LOOKS AS THOUGH SHE 
IS HEADING FOR HER THIRD FINISH AS 
THE RUNNER UP AND THE FAVOURITE 
GETE W. A. M. I. IN THE DISTANCE BUT 
IRINA MIKITENKO FORMERLY A ZERO 
METRE RUNNER FIFTH IN THE OLYMPIC

HER CHANCES SHE DOES NOT SEEM TO 
BE RUNNING AS SMOOTHLY AS SHE 
NORMALLY DOES BUT HAS BEEN BEATEN 
BY A VERY GOOD RUNNER ON THE DAY
