IT'S JUDGMENT DAY ON GREAT BRITISH MENU WHERE FOURTEEN OF OUR VERY BEST CHEFS 
ARE BATTLING FOR THE HONOUR OF SHOWING THAT CUTTING EDGE BRITISH COOKING IS SECOND TO NONE 
THE WINNERS WILL SERVE THEIR DISHES AT A BANQUET TO BE HELD 
AT THE TOP OF THE GHERKIN IN THE CITY OF LONDON 
HOSTING THAT PRESTIGIOUS MEAL WILL BE NONE OTHER THAN 
HESTON BLUMENTHAL HIMSELF A LEADING TRAILBLAZER OF CONTEMPORARY COOKING 
AND HIS GUESTS WILL INCLUDE MEMBERS OF THE WORLD'S GASTRONOMIC ELITE 
FLYING IN ESPECIALLY FOR THE NIGHT 
OUR CHEFS HAVE EVERYTHING TO PROVE 
DUELLING FOR THE LAST PLACE IN OUR NATIONAL FINAL 
ARE THE TWO CHEFS REPRESENTING LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST 
DESPITE BEING OLD FRIENDS ATUL KOCHHAR AND JASON ATHERTON HAVE BEEN STRIVING FOR SUPREMACY ALL WEEK 
TODAY ONE WILL CONTINUE IN THE COMPETITION AND ONE WILL LEAVE DEFEATED 
I'M CONFIDENT I'M ALWAYS CONFIDENT 
I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF I DIDN'T WANT TO BEAT HIM THERE'D BE NO POINT BEING HERE 
PREPARING FOR THEIR FINAL ROUND OF CULINARY COMBAT TODAY ARE TWO OF THE SOUTH EAST'S TOP CHEFS 
THE FIRST TO ARRIVE IS TWO TIME REGIONAL CHAMP AND MICHELIN STAR HOLDER ATUL KOCHHAR 
WITH A MISSION TO STICK TO SUPERBLY EXECUTED BRITISH INDIAN COOKING 
HE'S MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER TO WIN A PLACE IN THE FINAL 
I REALLY WANT TO GET THROUGH I'M HERE SO FAR AND 
I'D LIKE TO SEE MYSELF THROUGH IT'S IMPORTANT I DO THAT 
STRIVING TO TAKE THE REGIONAL CROWN OFF ATUL IS FELLOW MICHELIN STARRED CHEF JASON ATHERTON 
COMPETITIVE TO THE LAST HE'S HOPING THAT HIS MODERN BRITISH MEALS 
WITH INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCES WILL TICKLE THE TASTE BUDS OF OUR EXPERT PANEL 
I'M A BRITISH CHEF COOKING MODERN FOOD TOTALLY REGIONAL 
MY FOOD DESERVES A PLACE AT THE GHERKIN BUT ONLY THE JUDGES WILL DECIDE THAT 
MATTHEW FORT PRUE LEITH AND OLIVER PEYTON KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR 
BUT THEY ALSO KNOW THAT DECIDING WHICH OF THESE CHEFS 
GOES THROUGH TO THE FINALS WILL BE A VERY TOUGH CHOICE 
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE MOST COMPETITIVE DAY THAT WE'VE GOT AS JUDGES 
I HONESTLY BELIEVE JASON IS ONE OF THE FINEST CHEFS IN BRITAIN 
HE'S UP AGAINST ONE OF THE FINEST CHEFS IN BRITAIN TOO 
ATUL KOCHHAR FOR ME IS ONE OF THE FINEST EXPONENTS OF A FOOD VERY PARTICULAR TO THIS COUNTRY 
IN THE PAST WITH ATUL 
I FEEL THAT HE'S BEEN A LITTLE CONSTRAINED 
BY OUR EMPHASIS ON BRITISHNESS BUT THIS TIME HE'LL HAVE MORE FREEDOM 
TODAY EACH CHEF WILL SERVE UP HIS ENTIRE FOUR COURSE MODERN BRITISH MENU FOR THE JUDGES 
ATUL HEY ALL RIGHT 
ARE YOU GOING TO KICK MY ASS TODAY I'D NEVER DO THAT 
IT'S THE STARTERS FIRST OF COURSE AND FOR HIS DISH ATUL WILL BE 
PUTTING A MODERN SPIN ON THE GOOD OLD CUP OF CHAR AND BISCUITS 
HE'S SERVING A REFRESHING CHILLED PEA SOUP WITH CUMIN FOAM 
AND MINI POPPADOMS OR POORI TOPPED WITH PEAS AND POTATOES 
WHICH TOOK FOREVER TO COOK ON MONDAY 
ATUL BRINGING BACK ANY BAD MEMORIES BAD MEMORIES 
I'VE GOT NO BAD MEMORIES 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN JASON WILL BE PUTTING HIS MODERN TWIST 
ON A PLATE OF SANDWICHES 
HE'S COME UP WITH A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY B. L. T. IN A GLASS 
ACCOMPANIED BY A CROQUE MONSIEUR WITH TRUFFLES 
ATUL'S STARTER IS GOING FIRST 
THE KEY TO THE DISH IS GETTING THE DELICATE BALANCE OF CUMIN RIGHT IN HIS SOUP 
THE FOAM TOPPING AND THE MINI POPPADOMS PERFECTO 
ATUL MUST CONCENTRATE 
BUT JASON IS DOING HIS BEST TO DISTRACT HIM 
HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE GHERKIN ATUL YEAH I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN 
IT'S LIKE THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF MICHELIN WALKING IN 
LIKE A ROOM OF THEM NEVER MIND JUST ONE OF THEM THAT'S TRUE IT'S PRESSURE 
IT'S REAL PRESSURE YEAH 
THE SOUP IS READY 
COME ON JASON THIS IS A SERIOUS COMPETITION 
THE POPPADOMS ARE NEARLY DONE 
AND THERE'S JUST ONE IMPORTANT THING LEFT TO MAKE 
THE FOAM READY I'LL JUST MAKE IT IN THE LAST MINUTE 
YOU DID THAT LAST TIME 
EARLIER IN THE WEEK ATUL HAD A MAJOR UPSET WITH HIS FOAM 
SO INCREDIBLY HIS RIVAL VOLUNTEERS TO MAKE IT FOR HIM 
WELL THEY ARE FRIENDS 
NOW WE'RE ROCKING AND ROLLING THE DADDY'S BACK 
SO ONCE THE SELF APPOINTED FATHER OF FOAM HAS 
WHIPPED UP A STORM ATUL APPLIES THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO HIS DISH 
THE POPPADOMS ARE TOPPED OFF WITH A TOUCH OF TAMARIND CHUTNEY 
AND THE SOUP GETS A GOOD HEAD OF JASON'S FOAM 
I'M ALMOST READY JASON O. K. JASON GO 
THEY LOOK BEAUTIFUL WHERE DO YOU WANT THESE ATUL ON THE SIDE ON THE SIDE PLEASE 
THANK YOU GO SLOW HAPPY HAPPY VERY HAPPY AND I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THE FOAM 
I WONDER WHAT THE JUDGES WILL MAKE OF ATUL'S PEA SOUP AND LITTLE POORI THAT'S IF THEY CAN TELL IT IS SOUP 
OH GREEN TEA M. M. M. SUMMERY 
THAT SMELLS SO 
DELICATELY SPICED 
POORI ISN'T IT UNDERNEATH MM 
VERY LIGHT ALMOST CRUMBLY TEXTURE SLIGHTLY SANDY 
THIS IS SO INTERESTING BECAUSE PEA SOUP IS VERY BRITISH 
AND ALTHOUGH HE MUST HAVE A DOZEN FLAVOURS IN THAT LITTLE POORI 
IT'S NOT ONE BROWN MESS 
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HEAR YOU SING THE PRAISES OF A DISH WITH A FOAM ON TOP 
I KNOW AND THIS PRUE SORRY 
OH ANYTHING ELSE NO IT'S FINE 
SPINACH IN MY TEETH IT'S JUST THE FOAM O. K. 
I CAN SEE CHEFS AT THE GHERKIN I CAN SEE THEM WOLFING THAT DOWN 
WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PLEASURE THIS IS A STRONG MODERN DISH 
I CAN SEE THIS AT THE GHERKIN IT REALLY FITS ALL THE CRITERIA 
IT'S VERY MODERN THIS IS MODERN BRITISH COOKING 
IT LEAVES YOU FRESH AND GEARED UP FOR THE NEXT COURSE 
SO A CRACKING START FOR ATUL BUT OF COURSE HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT 
THE CHEFS WON'T HEAR THE JUDGE'S VERDICT UNTIL THE END OF THE DAY WHEN THEY'VE TASTED ALL THE DISHES 
JASON'S STARTER IS GOING NEXT 
HE'S PUTTING TOGETHER A VERY MODERN TAKE ON A PLATE OF SANDWICHES 
IT'LL BE A STYLISH DISH BUT ATUL CAN'T RESIST POKING FUN AT IT 
HOW ARE YOUR AMERICAN SANDWICHES COMING ALONG 
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD I WAS EVEN GOING TO FRY A BURGER IN THERE SOUNDS GOOD TO ME 
THERE'S A FRENCH ELEMENT TOO 
A CROQUE MONSIEUR GARNISHED WITH TRUFFLES 
HE THEN ASSEMBLES THE B. L. T. ITSELF 
TOMATO CONSOMME JELLY IS TOPPED WITH BACON AND ONION CREAM 
ONION RINGS AND BACON LARDONS 
ON MONDAY ATUL THOUGHT THAT THE LETTUCE VELOUTE OR SAUCE 
THAT JASON IS SERVING ALONGSIDE IT TASTED LIKE SPINACH 
SO HAS HE MADE ANY CHANGES 
IS IT LETTUCE TASTES LIKE LETTUCE THIS TIME 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS TIME IT TASTED LIKE LETTUCE LAST TIME DID IT 
THEN IT'S OFF TO THE JUDGES 
I THINK THAT'S MY SORT OF NOT WEAKEST DISH BUT I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT IT THAT'S ALL 
IT IS QUITE A COMPLICATED IDEA SO IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THE JUDGES MAKE OF IT 
MM IT'S A COCKTAIL PARTY 
OH LOOK CANAPES 
OH MY GOODNESS WHAT'S THAT GREEN STUFF LOOKS LIKE HEALTH FOOD 
I THINK THIS IS JUST SUCH FUN 
I LOVE THE BACON THE BACON IS REALLY DELICIOUS 
THESE LITTLE CRUNCHY NUGGETS OF ONION 
OH IT'S A B. L. T. ISN'T IT 
WELL DONE BACON LETTUCE AND TOMATO IS THAT TOMATO JELLY AT THE BOTTOM 
I GUESS SO 
IT MAKES YOU HAPPY JUST TO EAT IT DOESN'T IT 
IF THIS IS A B. L. T. WHAT IS THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO GUESS 
UM IT'S CHEESE AND HAM IT'S A CROQUE MONSIEUR WITH 
A CROQUE MONSIEUR AH 
I MUST SAY IT'S RATHER LIKE TRYING TO DO A CROSSWORD THIS 
A SERIES OF CLUES IN THERE 
A B. L. T. IS VERY AMERICAN 
AND A CROQUE MONSIEUR IS VERY FRENCH 
SO ARE WE HAVING A UNIVERSAL THIS IS A NOD TO THE INTERNATIONAL CHEFS ISN'T IT 
THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS FOR ME 
HE DIDN'T WAKE UP ONE MORNING FORGET TO SHAVE GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND MAKE THIS DISH 
THIS IS A DISH THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY A VERY VERY SMART CHEF 
IT'S SEASONAL IT'S SUMMERY IT'S INNOVATIVE IT'S PRETTY 
IT'S GOT THAT BANQUETY WOW FACTOR 
I'M NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO EAT A B. L. T. EVER AGAIN BECAUSE I'M GOING TO WANT THIS INDEED 
SO A GREAT RESULT FOR JASON TOO 
BUT IT'S STRAIGHT ON TO THE FISH COURSES AND ATUL IS FIRST TO GO AGAIN 
HE'S COOKING HIS VERSION OF A SALMON MADRAS 
SERVED WITH A LITTLE TOMATO CHUTNEY ON TOP OF SEMOLINA POLENTA 
AND THERE WILL BE A CURRY LEAF FOAM THIS TIME TO FINISH OFF THE FISH 
ON TUESDAY ATUL LOST TIME WHEN HE OVERHEATED THE POACHING PAN FOR HIS SALMON 
TODAY HE'S PLAYING IT SAFE 
AND USING A WATER BATH TO COOK THE FISH INSTEAD WHICH HASN'T ESCAPED 
THE EAGLE EYES OF HIS RIVAL WHO WILL BE USING THE SAME TECHNIQUE 
SHALL I SAY YOU INSPIRED ME WILL THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY 
I'M ALWAYS HAPPY ATUL'S NEW METHOD HAS PAID OFF 
THE SALMON IS PERFECT 
LOOK IT'S GORGEOUS 
I THINK I SHOULD JUST CRISP THE SKIN LIGHTLY YEAH 
YOU WOULDN'T THINK THEY'RE ARRIVALS AT ALL 
IF I GO THROUGH NEXT TIME IF I HAVE TO COMPETE AGAIN I'LL BRING YOU WITH ME 
O. K. I'LL BE YOUR SOUS CHEF RIGHT 
THEN I'M SURELY WINNING IF YOU ARE MY SOUS CHEF 
HE IS ALREADY REALLY ATUL'S GOT HIM DOING THIS FOAM TOO 
THIS IS CURRY FOAM YEAH YEAH 
OOPS 
I'D USE IT TO SHAVE THESE DAYS IT'S A BIT PASSE RIGHT 
IT'S A BIT PASSE MAYBE IT'S STILL NEW FOR ME MAYBE 
ATUL CAN NOW PLATE UP 
THE SALMON GOES ON TO THE SAMBAL SAUCE 
AND THE SEMOLINA POLENTA IS DRESSED WITH TOMATO AND RAISIN CHUTNEY 
IF YOU GO QUICK WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THIS ON THE TIME 
THAT'S A BIT CHEEKY I'LL BE QUICK 
THE FINISHING TOUCH OF COURSE THE CURRY LEAF FOAM 
STOP THE CLOCK DONE 
WOW LOOK AT THAT NICE GUYS HUH 
BUT ONCE THE DISHES HAVE GONE OFF TO THE JUDGES JASON DROPS A BOMBSHELL 
I FOUND OUT FROM A SOURCE RELIABLE OR UNRELIABLE 
VERY RELIABLE THE JUDGES HATE FOAM THEY HATE FOAM 
WELL HE COULD HAVE TOLD ATUL THAT WHILE HE WAS MAKING IT 
BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW AS HIS SALMON MADRAS COMPLETE WITH FOAM HITS THE JUDGES' TABLE 
D'YOU KNOW I'M SORRY I'M GOING TO GO ON ABOUT FROTHS AND FOAMS NOW 
YES DO FOAM AT THE MOUTH WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS FOAM 
IT HAS NO FLAVOUR IT'S JUST LIKE SPIT ON THE PLATE WHAT IS IT ABOUT 
THE LEAVES INSIDE IT I SUPPOSE YOU CAN EAT THEM 
NO YOU CAN'T I DEFY YOU TO EAT THOSE LEAVES 
I'VE JUST EATEN MINE 
I EAT EVERYTHING AS YOU KNOW PRUE 
I LIKE THIS FISH FINGER LOOKING THING I THINK IT'S FISH FINGER COUSCOUS 
IT'S OUT OF SEMOLINA I THINK 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY LIGHT AS THISTLE DOWN THAT'S QUITE NICE 
IF YOU LIKE SEMOLINA PUDDING IT'S QUITE NICE ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU DON'T LIKE SEMOLINA PUDDING PRUE 
WELL THIS IS JUST MILD SOGGY SEMOLINA WITH SOME VERY NICE TOMATO KETCHUP ON TOP 
I THINK THE SALMON TASTES QUITE NICE 
IT'S VERY NICELY COOKED BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS 
COMPETITION TO BE HONEST WITH YOU NOR ME 
I THINK THERE'S VERY LITTLE FLAVOUR IN THE CURRY SAUCE 
VERY LOW IMPACT DO WE TALK ABOUT THINGS BEEN FEEBLE FLAVOURED 
OR DO WE TALK ABOUT THEM BEING DELICATE 
I THINK THAT'S QUITE A DELICATE SAUCE 
FEEBLE WITH A DELICATE FISH 
FEEBLE SO IT GOES WELL TOGETHER 
I SORT OF AGREE WITH YOU BUT I DON'T EVEN THINK THIS DISH IS PARTICULARLY MODERN A FOAM 
FOAM THE HALLMARK OF MODERN COOKING 
THAT'S ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF MODERN COOKING I DON'T LIKE 
THE ONE BIT OF MODERNITY ON THIS DISH IS THE ONE THING I REALLY HATE 
WELL ATUL'S FISH COURSE SANK LIKE A STONE 
NOW IT'S JASON'S TURN AND HE'S USING SALMON TOO 
HIS FISH THOUGH HAS ALREADY BEEN CURED AND LIGHTLY SMOKED SO THERE'S NOT MUCH COOKING INVOLVED 
THE SALMON WILL SIT NEXT TO AN AVOCADO PUREE 
WITH HORSERADISH SNOW AND WILL BE TOPPED WITH A RYE BREAD CRACKER 
THE SALMON IS VACUUM PACKED WITH OLIVE OIL AND DROPPED INTO A WATER BATH FOR TEN MINUTES 
JASON MAY NOT HAVE BEEN TOO CONFIDENT ABOUT HIS STARTER 
BUT HE THINKS HE HAS A WINNER WITH THIS COURSE 
MY FISH DISH I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH MY MEAT AND MY 
FISH DISH YOU SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COOK IT 
IT'S THE LOVE AND ATTENTION IT'S BEEN PREPARED WITH THAT'S THE THING 
I DON'T JUST STICK THINGS IN A WOK YOU KNOW 
HE SAID THAT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE SO I THINK HE WAS JOKING 
HE'S NEARLY FINISHED NOW 
ALL HE HAS TO DO IS FINELY SLICE THE RYE BREAD FOR HIS CRACKER 
BLITZ UP HIS AVOCADO PUREE AND SALT THE SALMON 
BUT SIMPLE DISHES NEED VERY CAREFUL PRESENTATION IF THEY'RE NOT TO LOOK EASY 
A LITTLE CAVIAR SHOULD HELP 
BUT THE REALLY CLASSY TOUCH IS THE HORSERADISH FLAVOURED SNOW 
QUALITY OF SNOW IS GOOD IT'S READY TO GO 
I KNOW YOU'RE DYING TO ASK ME WHY SNOW IN SUMMER YEAH 
WHY NOT INDEED 
JUST BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE TAKING THE CLOCHES OFF YOU DON'T KNOCK THE TWILL 
QUICK AS YOU CAN PLEASE SO THE SNOW DOESN'T MELT 
BUT WILL THE JUDGES APPRECIATE THE SNOW 
WELL THAT IS A BIG THICK CHUNK OF SALMON 
YOU'LL HAVE TO LIKE RAW FISH TO LIKE THIS DISH 
NO THIS IS NOT RAW IS IT SMOKED 
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU COOK AT VERY LOW TEMPERATURE 
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING NOW I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO WHAT YOU'VE BEEN SAYING 
I HANG UPON YOUR EVERY WORD 
YOU SHOULD HANG UPON THIS I DON'T LIKE IT 
WHY IS THAT I THINK THE SALMON IS TOO SLAB LIKE 
I WILL STARTLE YOU EVEN MORE 
IT'S A BIT SALTY 
I'M GONNA SAY SOMETHING ELSE I DON'T THINK THE QUALITY OF THE FISH IS THAT GOOD 
I THINK SADLY IT DOESN'T QUITE WORK 
WE'VE SORT OF MOVED IT SEEMS TO ME FROM THE BALLET SLIPPERS 
OF THE FIRST COURSE TO CLOG DANCING WITH THIS REALLY 
WE ARE NOW HALFWAY THROUGH THE MENUS AND BOTH CHEFS ARE ENJOYING MIXED FORTUNES 
STILL TO COME WE FIND OUT WHICH OF THE DISHES GETS THIS RESPONSE 
THIS IS WHAT I DID CALL A VERY BRAVE DISH 
I'M NOT SURE IT'S A VERY WELL ADVISED DISH 
AND WE'LL DISCOVER WHETHER IT'S ATUL OR JASON WHO TAKES THE ONE REMAINING PLACE IN OUR NATIONAL FINAL 
THE CHEF GOING FORWARD TO REPRESENT LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST IN THE FINAL OF THE GREAT BRITISH MENU IS 
SO NOW IT IS ON TO THE MAIN COURSE 
JASON WILL BE THE FIRST TO PLATE UP 
HE'S CHOSEN A HEARTY DISH OF DEXTER BEEF FILLET WITH OX CHEEK 
SMOKED POMME PUREE AND MARROWBONE 
HE'S EVEN GOT INTO TROUBLE OF BRINGING ALONG 
HIS OWN WOODEN PLATTERS TO SERVE IT ON 
BOTH CHEFS HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR THIS COMPETITION 
BUT WHILE JASON GETS ON WITH PREPARING HIS BEEF 
TALK IN THE KITCHEN TURNS TO THEIR PREVIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS 
SO YOU ALWAYS WANTED A MICHELIN STAR 
I JUST KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE TO A YOUNG CHEF LIKE MYSELF 
GROWING UP INTO THAT WHOLE MICHELIN ENVIRONMENT 
DID YOU ALWAYS HAVE AMBITIONS TO GET MICHELIN STARRED AND BE THE FIRST 
INDIAN CUISINE TYPE RESTAURANT TO GET ON I NEVER AIMED FOR IT 
THE FIRST TIME I WAS TOLD I HUNG THE PHONE UP 
WHY DID YOU HANG THE PHONE UP 
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMEBODY PULLING A PRANK ON ME 
FINALLY THEY CALLED ME AND SAID I'M BEING SERIOUS 
SINCE THAT CALL ATUL'S CAREER HAS GONE FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH 
HE HAS WON THIS HEAT IN BOTH PREVIOUS GREAT BRITISH MENU COMPETITIONS 
HAS HE FINALLY MET HIS MATCH IN JASON 
FOR HIS MAIN COURSE HE'S PAN FRYING BEEF FILLETS BRAISING SOME OX CHEEK 
AND ADDING A SMOKY FLAVOUR TO HIS POMME PUREE 
ALL THAT REMAINS IS TO PLATE UP OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT ON A POSH CHOPPING BOARD 
O. K. GUYS SPEAKS FOR ITSELF SIT IT IN FRONT OF THE JUDGES LIKE THAT 
AND AWAY YOU GO 
AT THE END OF THE DAY DOWN TO THE JUDGES 
IF THEY LIKE IT OR DON'T I'VE GIVEN IT MY BEST SHOT THEY'LL LIKE IT 
BUT WILL THEY THIS IS DEFINITELY A DISH FOR SERIOUS CARNIVORES 
THIS IS SORT OF PREHISTORIC MAN'S PLATTER ISN'T IT 
A VERY SENIOR PIECE OF BEAUTIFUL BEEF ISN'T IT 
I WASN'T THINKING OF THAT I WAS THINKING OF THE MASHED POTATO 
LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING HAS BEEN LIFTED OUT OF SOME SORT OF SWAMP BRISTLING LIKE THAT 
THIS BEEF IS HEAVEN 
I THINK THE POTATO AND THE UM 
THE CHEEK ARE JUST PERFECT IT'S A REAL CELEBRATION OF PRODUCE 
THAT'S A GREAT PIECE OF BEEF 
ONE CAN'T SAY THIS IS THE MOST SUMMERY LOOKING DISH WE'VE EVER SEEN 
I DON'T MIND BECAUSE IT TASTES SO WONDERFUL 
I DON'T THINK IT'S MODERN A LA AIR BLOWING ROUND THE PLATE 
AND THAT BUT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY WELL CONSTRUCTED DISH 
I WOULD BE EXTREMELY HAPPY TO SEE THIS AT THE GHERKIN 
EXCELLENT MEAT 
AND THE SMOKED MASH I THINK WAS A LITTLE TOUCH OF GENIUS IT'S PERFECT 
SO JASON'S MAIN COURSE HAS GOT HIM BACK ON TRACK WITH THE JUDGES 
CAN ATUL REDEEM HIMSELF WITH THIS COURSE TOO 
HE IS GOING FOR AN AYLESBURY DUCK BREAST 
WITH DUCK FOIE GRAS ICE CREAM 
A CORIANDER AND COCONUT PESTO 
AND A GARNISH OF MANGO AND PINEAPPLE SALSA 
HE'S DECIDED TO SERVE THE DUCK BREASTS WARM RATHER THAN HOT LEAVING THE MEAT VERY RARE 
WILL THAT BE TO THE JUDGES' TASTE I WONDER 
BEFORE THEY EVEN GET A CHANCE TO TRY IT DISASTER STRIKES ATUL'S FOIE GRAS ICE CREAM 
THE MACHINE HAS BROKEN DOWN 
WHAT'S HAPPENED ATUL THE BLADE IS BROKEN 
THE BLADE THAT CHURNS THE ICE CREAM HAS SHEARED OFF LEAVING ATUL IN THE LURCH 
HIS DUCK BREASTS ARE NEARLY READY BUT FOR NOW HIS DISH HAS TO BE PUT ON HOLD 
IT'S A MAJOR BLOW 
COME ON ATUL WE'RE GONNA GET IT SORTED OUT I'M ON THE PHONE NOW 
LUCKILY JASON HAS A SIMILAR MACHINE IN HIS RESTAURANT WHICH IS ONLY A FEW MINUTES FROM HERE 
A QUICK PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES FOR A 
REPLACEMENT BLADE TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN 
T. A. A. DAA T. A. A. DAA THANK YOU 
THEY ARE BOTH DESPERATE TO WIN BUT THEY'VE BEEN REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF ONE ANOTHER ALL WEEK 
ATUL QUICKLY BOUNCES BACK 
LOOK AT THAT 
YOU'RE NORMALLY NOT LIKE THAT ATUL I'M NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL 
YOU'RE LIKE AN ASIAN JAMES BOND 
SHAKEN BUT NOT STIRRED SHAKEN 
DOES THAT MAKE JASON MISS MONEYPENNY THEN 
THANKS A LOT I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH MY PLEASURE MADE MY DAY 
ATUL IS BACK IN BUSINESS AND HIS FOIE GRAS ICE CREAM 
IS SOON READY TO JOIN THE WARM DUCK BREASTS AS HE PLATES UP 
OH THIS IS GOOD 
EVEN WITH THE COMPLICATIONS AND DELAYS ATUL STILL HAS EVERY FAITH THAT HIS DUCK DISH IS A WINNER 
ICE CREAM LOOK PERFECT AND TASTED FINE 
THE DUCK LOOKED PERFECT THANK GOD 
THANKS TO MODERN TECHNOLOGY I COULD HOLD THE DUCK AT FORTY DEGREES 
I'M HAPPY WITH THAT 
D. A. D. A. D. A. ICE CREAM AND FRUIT SALAD 
WITH A BIT OF DUCK DUCK IT IS 
LET'S TRY THE ICE CREAM I HAVE TO SAY THAT GREEN SAUCE IS DELICIOUS 
WHAT IS THE THEORY BEHIND ULTRA RAW DUCK 
THE DUCK ITSELF IT'S VERY TASTY BUT IT'S JUST NOT A MARRIAGE 
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT 
THIS IS WHAT I WOULD CALL A VERY BRAVE DISH 
I'M NOT SURE IT'S A VERY WELL ADVISED DISH 
EVERY ONE OF THESE THERE'S SORT OF PARFAIT 
AND THAT CORIANDER AND COCONUT PESTO THING 
EVEN THE RAW DUCK WOULD BE REALLY A LOT BETTER ON A PIECE OF TOAST 
I MEAN THEY CRY OUT FOR SOMETHING CRISP AND 
IT ALSO CRIES OUT FOR A BIT OF HEAT DOESN'T IT YEAH HOT AND CRISP 
IT'S A MODERN DISH INSOFAR AS NOTHING QUITE LIKE IT HAS EVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE 
OR WILL AGAIN 
IT'S TIME FOR THE PUDDINGS 
WELL THAT ONE DIDN'T COME OFF FOR ATUL 
BUT THE CHEFS GET LITTLE TIME TO REFLECT ON JUDGMENT DAY 
THEY HAVE TO GET ON WITH THEIR DESSERTS 
JASON'S GOING FIRST AGAIN WITH HIS ARCTIC ROLL RASPBERRY SALAD 
AND A RASPBERRY AND SARAWAK PEPPER JELLY 
HOW LONG TO GO JASON ABOUT A MINUTE LEFT O. K. 
NOW ATUL HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF ARCTIC ROLL UNTIL YESTERDAY 
SO IS UPDATING A BRITISH CHILDHOOD FAVOURITE A WISE CHOICE 
FOR A BANQUET WHERE SOME OF THE GUESTS MAY NOT GET THE JOKE 
SO YOU DO YOU THINK ALL THESE GUESTS WILL UNDERSTAND YOUR HUMOUR ABOUT ARCTIC ROLL 
I'M HOPING HESTON'S GONNA 
IF WE GET THROUGH HESTON WILL HELP ME OUT HOPEFULLY IF WE GET THROUGH OF COURSE 
READY 
AWAY YOU GO THERE YOU GO IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL 
IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT THEY DON'T LIKE IT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO THAT'S THE STYLE OF FOOD I COOK 
IT'S THE STYLE OF FOOD I SERVE IN MY RESTAURANT SO IT IS REALLY NOW DOWN TO THE JUDGES 
IT CERTAINLY IS 
SO WILL JASON'S DESSERT BE GRAND ENOUGH FOR THE BANQUET IN JUNE 
OH THAT'S WONDERFUL IT'S ARCTIC ROLL 
IT WAS THE HEIGHT OF SOPHISTICATION WHEN I WAS GROWING UP 
IS IT GOOD 
DELICIOUS YOU'RE FINALLY IN YOUR ELEMENT THEN 
YEAH VERY GOOD IT'S PROPER JELLY TOO DELICIOUS 
DO YOU THINK I EAT THE FLOWERS 
OH YES FLOWERS ARE THERE FOR EATING 
IT'S A PUDDING WHICH IS GOING TO MEAN RATHER LESS TO YOU 
IF YOU DIDN'T GROW UP WITH ARCTIC ROLL AND JELLY IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE AN ENGLISH CHILDHOOD 
LUCKILY MATTHEW I'M NOT AS OLD AS YOU SO I DON'T REMEMBER THIS DISH 
BUT IT'S NICE THE ROLL THING LOOKED VERY PRETTY WHEN IT CAME UP IT'S VANILLA ICE CREAM 
IT WAS RESTRAINED NOT TOO MUCH 
AND VERY DELICATELY DONE 
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT WAS THE BEST PUDDING I'VE EVER EATEN BUT IT WAS VERY NICE 
SO THEY ALL ENJOYED IT 
BUT WILL THAT BE ENOUGH TO WIN THE COMPETITION 
ATUL'S FINAL DISH IS 
A GREEN CARDAMOM LIME PANNACOTTA WITH A STRAWBERRY SORBET 
AND STRAWBERRY TOPPED SHORTBREAD BISCUITS 
HE NEEDS THIS TO BE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
SO CAN HE FORGET THE SETBACKS HE HAD WITH THE LAST COURSE 
DO YOU LIKE ZEN THEM OUT 
NO I'M ALWAYS LIKE THAT JASON 
AND IF THERE WAS ANY BAD MEMORY I DON'T REMEMBER 
CHOOSING RECTANGLES OF PANNACOTTA 
THAT HAVE THE RIGHT THICKNESS OF JELLY ATUL BEGINS PLATING UP 
HE CARAMELISES HIS SLICED STRAWBERRIES IN A FRYING PAN 
AND TOPS HIS SHORTBREAD BISCUITS WITH STRAWBERRY SAUCE AND SORBET 
THE FINAL DISH IS ON ITS WAY TO THE JUDGES' CHAMBER 
O. K. OFF YOU GO CLOCHES BOYS READY 
THANKS WELL DONE 
WELL DONE MATE THANK YOU 
NOTHING I CAN DO I'VE DONE MY BIT 
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT 
WELL HE WON'T HAVE TO WAIT TOO LONG NOW TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY MAKE OF HIS DESSERT 
PRETTY IN PINK 
PRETTY IN JELLY 
JELLY JELLY 
WITH A LITTLE SORT OF PANACOTTA OR SOMETHING UNDERNEATH OR 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S ANOTHER MILK JELLY 
IT LOOKS LIKE A MILK JELLY TO ME 
CRUNCHY OAT SHORTBREAD UNDERNEATH 
ACTUALLY THAT IS A VERY VERY NICE PANNACOTTA AND A VERY NICE JELLY 
YES A VERY NICE PANNACOTTA AND JELLY 
WELL I THINK IT'S DELICIOUS 
AND IT'S NOT WILDLY ORIGINAL BUT IT'S INTERESTINGLY SPICED 
I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB HERE AGAIN 
I'M GOING TO SAY THIS IS A SAFE PAIR OF HANDS 
I THINK SOMEONE HERE HAS GONE FOR THE SAFETY GAME 
I THINK IF THIS WENT TO THE GHERKIN 
THEN I THINK THERE WOULD BE A BIT OF 
SORT OF RAISED EYEBROW AND SO WHAT 
FROM THE ASSEMBLED DIGNITARIES 
SO THE JUDGES HAVE EATEN THEIR LAST COURSE AND IT'S NOW TIME FOR THEM TO CONSIDER THEIR VERDICT 
WHILE THE CHEFS WAIT ANXIOUSLY TO HEAR THEIR FATE THE JUDGES CAN SEE THE FULL MENUS AT LAST 
THEY MAY WELL HAVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL FAVOURITE DISHES BUT THEY CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE 
THEY HAVE TO CONSIDER THE MENUS AS A WHOLE AND VOTE FOR THE ONE 
THEY THINK IS THE MOST CUTTING EDGE AND INVENTIVE EXAMPLE 
OF TOP QUALITY CONTEMPORARY BRITISH FOOD 
WE GOT OFF TO SUCH A TREMENDOUS START WITH BOTH THE FIRST COURSES BUT THEY BOTH HAD WEAK MOMENTS 
I CAN THINK OF AT LEAST ONE COURSE THAT I THOUGHT WAS 
MORE INTERESTING THAN IT WAS EDIBLE IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
AT LEAST TWO COURSES ALL RIGHT COME ON 
HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND I'VE MADE UP MY MIND 
I HAVE TOO 
AND INDEED SO HAVE I 
I GUESS WE NEED TO BRING IN THE CHEFS 
IT'S CRUNCH TIME 
THE CHEFS ARE CALLED INTO THE JUDGES' CHAMBER FOR THE FINAL VERDICT 
WELCOME CHEFS HOW ARE YOU FEELING 
VERY NERVOUS FOR US IT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT DAY BUT WE HAVE EATEN 
SOME YOU KNOW WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE WORLD BEATING FOOD TODAY 
SO I'M GOING TO ASK MY FELLOW JUDGES WHO THEY ARE VOTING FOR 
MENU A MENU A MATTHEW MENU A 
I'M ALSO GOING FOR CHEF A THAT MEANS IT'S AN UNANIMOUS DECISION 
SO PRU COULD I HAVE THE ENVELOPE PLEASE 
THE CHEF GOING FORWARD TO REPRESENT LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST 
JASON ATHERTON WELL DONE 
GET IN THERE 
CONGRATULATIONS WELL DONE THANK YOU 
WELL DONE JASON JASON WELL DONE 
THERE WERE TWO AMAZING DISHES THE STARTER WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE 
AND BOILED BEEF WHICH WAS JUST STUNNING 
EVERYTHING WAS FANTASTIC ABOUT IT SO REALLY 
WE EVEN FOR GAVE YOU FOR NOT BEING PARTICULARLY SUMMERY 
WE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS SO WONDERFUL 
ATUL AS ALWAYS AN EXTRAORDINARILY ILLUMINATING AND GRACEFUL EXERCISE 
IN COOKING A WONDERFUL INDIVIDUAL STYLE BUT ON THE DAY I VOTED FOR 
JASON BECAUSE WHEN YOU DELIVER A DISH IT HAS AN EXTRAORDINARY PRECISION OF FLAVOUR AND I THINK 
TODAY YOU COOKED TWO ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING COURSES AND THE REST OF THEM WEREN'T TOO BAD EITHER 
JASON I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU IN THE FINAL THANK YOU OLIVER 
THANK YOU PRU THANK YOU MATTHEW THANK YOU 
HERE YOU GO GUYS SIOBHAN

CHEERS GUYS 
I'M SAD THAT THE SPICES WERE NOT VERY PRESENT WHICH IS CULTURALLY VERY BRITISH

IT WAS ONE OF THE SCARIEST THINGS I'VE EVER DONE 
GOING INTO THAT ROOM BUT YOU KNOW I'VE COME OUT VICTORIOUS AND I'M A VERY VERY HAPPY BUNNY 
SO FROM FOURTEEN HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED CHEFS WE'RE DOWN TO THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN FINALISTS 
STARTING ON MONDAY THE COMPETITION REACHES ITS CLIMAX 
THE JUDGES WILL HAVE THEIR SAY 
BUT IT WILL BE UP TO YOU AT HOME AS WELL TO VOTE FOR THE DISHES 
THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE UP THE MENU FOR HESTON BLUMENTHAL'S BANQUET AT THE GHERKIN
