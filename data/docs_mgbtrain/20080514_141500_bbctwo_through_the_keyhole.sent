THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
OUR MISSION TODAY IS TO UNCOVER THE IDENTITY OF TWO CELEBRITY HOMEOWNERS 
WHOSE HOUSE KEYS OUR INTREPID INVESTIGATOR LISA SNOWDON HAS MANAGED TO OBTAIN 
AND HERE IS LISA TO TELL US WHAT'S IN STORE TODAY 
RED SKY AT NIGHT DESIGNER'S DELIGHT 
RED SKY IN THE MORNING FASHION WARNING 
THE ENDING IS NEAT CONCEPT COMPLETE 
LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY GRUB GOING COO EE GARCON 
THE CLUES ARE ALL THERE BUT WHO'S PLAYING THE GAME TODAY 
WELL WHO'S PLAYING THE GAME TODAY 
IT'S OUR PANEL 
AND WHAT A PANEL THEY ARE 
THEIR BRAINS SHOULD BE DONATED TO MEDICAL SCIENCE 
IDEALLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
OUR FIRST PANELLIST IS THE POPULAR HOST OF FLOG IT 
AND A FAN OF FINE CHINA HE SAYS 
NOTHING GIVES ME MORE PLEASURE THAN WHEN SOME WOMAN TURNS UP WITH A NICE PAIR OF JUGS 
YES IT'S ANTIQUES EXPERT PAUL MARTIN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
A HIGHLY TALENTED ACTRESS OUR NEXT PANELLIST WAS MUCH PRAISED FOR HER ROLE IN BAD GIRLS 
SHE RECEIVED TWO NATIONAL TELEVISION AWARD NOMINATIONS 
AND SIX MONTHS' REMISSION FOR GOOD BEHAVIOUR 
YES IT'S DEBRA STEPHENSON 
OUR NEXT GUEST SAYS IF HE WINS THE LOTTERY 
HE MIGHT BUY HIS FAVOURITE FOOTBALL TEAM WYCOMBE WANDERERS 
BUT IF HE GETS MORE THAN THREE NUMBERS HE'LL BUY SOMEONE ELSE 
WILL YOU WELCOME BILL TURNBULL 
SO HOW DO WE PLAY THE GAME THEN 
WELL WITH THE AID OF OUR MAGIC KEYS 
AND LISA SNOWDON'S INVESTIGATIVE SKILLS 
WE'LL PAY A VISIT TO TWO CELEBRITY HOMES 
WHICH LISA WILL TOUR ON OUR BEHALF 
AND INDEED AT OUR EXPENSE 
ALL OUR PANEL HAVE TO DO IS TO GUESS 
WITH THE HELP OF OUR STUDIO AUDIENCE 
JUST WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THAT 
SO LET'S JOIN LISA RIGHT NOW AT HOUSE NUMBER ONE 
AND WATCH CLOSELY BECAUSE REMEMBER THE CLUES ARE THERE 
AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
I'M NEAR PORTSMOUTH DOWN ON THE SOUTH COAST 
AND I WOULD SHOW YOU THE SEA BUT THIS IS MUCH MORE INTERESTING 
THIS FABULOUS GARDEN 
THIS TERRACE OVERLOOKS A SWIMMING POOL 
THERE'S TENNIS COURTS AT THE BACK 
AND OF COURSE A TEPEE 
WHICH MAKES ME WANT TO SAY HOW 
IT'S SLIGHTLY UNREAL ISN'T IT 
I MEAN WE ALL LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE IN OUR LIVES BUT THIS IS AWESOME 
OBVIOUSLY A HUGE SPACE NOT CLUTTERED 
HEAVEN KNOWS HOW YOU BEGIN TO CLUTTER THIS 
ALTHOUGH I'M SURE I'D MANAGE SOMEHOW 
NOW THE ROOM IS DOMINATED BY THIS VERY UNIQUE SOFA 
IT WAS ONCE A WOODEN BOAT THAT PERISHED ON THE HIGH SEAS 
BUT IT DOES SUM THIS PERSON UP 
INNOVATIVE CLEVER AND THERE'S SOMETHING VERY UNIQUE ABOUT THEM 
THERE'S ALSO A SENSE OF FUN WITH THIS SNOOKER TABLE 
AND THIS TABLE TENNIS TABLE 
SO A FAMILY HOME PERHAPS AT ONE TIME 
FANCY A LITTLE GO AT GETTING THAT RED IN THE CORNER 
O. K. 
YES 
BUT WHEN YOU GET FED UP OF BALL GAMES YOU CAN GO FOR A CLIMB 
YUP THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN CLIMBING WALL 
AND NO I'M NOT GOING UP IT 
THERE ARE SOME FABULOUS OBJECTS IN THIS HOUSE 
THESE STRING CHAIRS CALLED HARP CHAIRS ARE BOTH UNUSUAL AND CLEVER 
THIS KITCHEN IS UNLIKE ANY I'VE SEEN 
AT FIRST GLANCE IT'S NOT OBVIOUSLY A KITCHEN 
BUT THIS UNFORTUNATE CHAP POINTS US TO THE FACT THAT IT IS 
O. K. SO IT'S A LITTLE VIOLENT BUT IT'S QUIRKY AND I LOVE THE COLOUR 
HE'S RED AND HE'S DEFINITELY VERY DEAD 
BUT THIS IS MORE OF A WORK SPACE AND NOT FOR COOKING 
SO PERHAPS THIS PERSON STARTED THEIR BUSINESS FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE 
AND THEN AFTER IT BECAME A HUGE SUCCESS DECIDED TO CARRY ON 
A GIANT POST IT I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE 
WHAT KIND OF NOTE WOULD YOU LEAVE ON HERE 
ONE THAT COULDN'T BE IGNORED 
STYLE AND DESIGN SEEM TO BE SOMETHING OF AN OBSESSION WITH THIS PERSON 
AND THEY COVER A VARIETY OF SUBJECTS 
GARDENS TO HIP HOTELS TO PUNK FASHION 
AND EVEN TATTOOS ARE OF INTEREST 
THEY'RE INTERESTED IN IMAGES AND THEIR IMAGE IN PARTICULAR 
THIS IS NO STARGAZER BUT THEY DO HAVE VISION 
THIS IS THE HOME CINEMA 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S ON THE SCREEN BUT I DO LOVE WHAT'S ON THE WALLS 
YOU MIGHT RECOGNISE THEM BECAUSE SMALLER VERSIONS SOLD IN THEIR THOUSANDS AT ONE TIME 
AND MOST HOUSES YOU VISITED HAD SOMETHING SIMILAR 
IT WAS MASS MARKET ART 
HERE'S ANOTHER OF THESE ICONIC MASS ART IMAGES THAT WE SAW UPSTAIRS 
I REMEMBER THEM SO WELL 
AND I LOVE THIS COLOUR 
IT'S A REAL DYNAMIC VIBRANT RED 
IT'S A FISH TANK LOO 
BUT DON'T WORRY THERE'S NO FISH IN IT 
AT LEAST I HOPE NOT 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN 
THE MASS MARKET ART THE QUIRKY KITCHEN APPLIANCE 
AND THE FISH TANK LOO WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LISA 
AND NOW FOR OUR STUDIO AUDIENCE AND OUR HOME AUDIENCE 
BUT NOT FOR OUR PANEL HERE'S WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
OVER TO YOU PAUL OH THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME START 
WHERE DO I START WHAT A SURPRISINGLY MINIMALISTIC HOUSE RIGHT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
I MEAN IT'S SOMEONE THAT'S VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL 
THEY'VE MADE A LOT OF MONEY YUP 
THEY'VE GOT IMPECCABLE TASTE 
FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE YOUR WEEKEND PLACE 
ESPECIALLY WITH THE RED SOCKS GOING ON THERE'S A RED CONNECTION 
IS THERE A RED CONNECTION SOMEWHERE RED WAS MENTIONED SO MANY TIMES 
WELL YOU'RE SPOT ON THERE OTHER THAN THAT HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE 
DEBRA 
WELL THIS IS A VERY ARTISTIC PERSON ISN'T IT 
I THINK THAT SOMEBODY WITH THIS KIND OF FLAIR 
AND THIS KIND OF EYE COULD ONLY BE A DESIGNER 
I WAS THINKING INTERIORS 
BUT SOMETHING ELSE IS LEADING ME TO THINK FASHION 
BILL WELL I'M THINKING FROM THE FACT THAT THERE IS THE TABLE TENNIS 
AND THE SNOOKER TABLE AND THEN THE ROCK CLIMBING WALL 
I'M PRESUMING IT'S A MAN RATHER THAN A WOMAN 
ON THE CUTTING EDGE LOOKING AT THE LITERATURE 
I THOUGHT WHOEVER IT IS REALLY KEEPS UP TO DATE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON 
MAYBE A SORT OF FASHIONABLE PERSON 
AND IT'S A VERY VERY NICE HOUSE 
I THOUGHT THERE MIGHT EVEN BE A NAUTICAL CONNECTION 
BUT I DON'T KNOW COULD IT BE A SAILING FASHION DESIGNER 
HARDLY THERE AREN'T THAT MANY THAT I'VE HEARD OF 
SO OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK BUT I'M HOPING FOR SOME HELP 
I'M LOST I REALLY DON'T KNOW ANYBODY 
WHAT'S THE RED CONNECTION I DON'T KNOW THE SOCKS 
I'M WONDERING IF IT'S SOMETHING TO DO WITH RED OR DEAD 
YEAH IT COULDN'T BE ANYTHING TO DO WITH 
THAT MAKES ME THINK MANCHESTER UNITED BUT THAT CAN'T BE ANYTHING TO DO WITH PORTSMOUTH 
WELL COULD IT FOOTBALL RED OR DEAD IS THE LEAD SO 
RED OR DEAD'S A FASHION LABEL AH 
WHO'S BEHIND IT YEAH WELL I WAS THINKING 
I CAN'T THINK WHO IS BEHIND IT ACTUALLY 
BUT I WAS THINKING ALONG THE LINES OF VIVIEN WESTWOOD BUT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A MAN 
BUT WE SAW SOME PUNK INFLUENCES THERE 
SO I'M THINKING IT WOULD BE SOMEONE MAYBE WHO WORKED WITH HER 
HAS HE MOVED ON IN A DIFFERENT NAME 
ANOTHER HIGH STREET CHAIN IN A DIFFERENT NAME 
A DIFFERENT NAME BUT NOT A HIGH STREET CHAIN THEY'VE GOT HALF MARKS I THINK 
HALF MARKS FROM THE HEADMASTER HERE 
AND YOU'LL KICK YOURSELVES WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THE MAN HIMSELF 
WHO'S NOW GOT HIS OWN BUSINESS UNDER HIS OWN NAME IS WAYNE HEMINGWAY 
AND SO WILL YOU COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
WAYNE HEMINGWAY 
THEY WERE VERY CLOSE THEY HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE WHO I AM ANYWAY SO IT'S FINE 
WHICH IS THE WAY I LIKE IT THE WAY YOU LIKE IT SO THAT'S ALL RIGHT THAT'S ALL RIGHT 
BUT YOU WERE SAYING YOU WERE REALLY CLOSE YOU DID VERY WELL TO GET THE RED OR DEAD 
I'M SO ANNOYED WITH MYSELF BECAUSE THE NAME ERNEST HEMINGWAY KEPT COMING INTO MY HEAD 
AND I KEPT THINKING BUT WHY DON'T BE SILLY YOU MUSTN'T SAY THAT THAT'S MY SON 
THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR AREN'T YOU THE TWO OF YOU 
YEAH YOU GET MISTAKEN FOR ERNEST HEMINGWAY ALL THE TIME 
I WRITE A FEW TRAVEL ARTICLES AND HE WROTE A FEW TRAVEL BOOKS 
THERE'S NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE IS THERE 
AND WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RED OR DEAD AND THE NEW BUSINESS 
WE SOLD RED OR DEAD IN THE NINETIES SO I EXCUSE YOU FOR NOT LINKING US WITH IT 
AND I'M QUITE PLEASED THAT WE'VE MOVED ON 
AND PEOPLE ASSOCIATE ME WITH OTHER THINGS 
MYSELF AND GERALDINE WHO STARTED RED OR DEAD 
MY WIFE AND IT'S OUR TWENTY FIFTH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR GOSH AWW 
AWW 
AND SHE'S STILL AS LOVELY AS SHE WAS BACK THEN 
AND SO ARE YOU THANK YOU SHE'S THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL IN THAT HOUSE 
THAT YOU KNOW SHE'S THE ONE THAT'S DONE ALL THE DETAIL AND WE JUST 
WHEN WE SOLD RED OR DEAD WE'D EARNED A LOT OF MONEY 
WE HAVE COME FROM GENUINE WORKING CLASS BACKGROUNDS 
AND WE DECIDED FROM NOW ON WE'LL REALLY DO THINGS THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AS DESIGNERS 
DESIGNERS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE YOU'VE GOT THIS KIND OF BRAIN THAT NEVER EVER SETTLES 
ALWAYS WANTS THINGS TO BE BETTER 
THE THING THAT REALLY WOUND US UP WAS THE STATE OF BRITISH AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
AND SO I WROTE AN ARTICLE IN THE INDEPENDENT 
ABOUT THE WIMPEYFICATION AND THE BARRATTIFICATION OF BRITAIN ATTACKING THE BIG HOUSE BUILDERS 
FOR BUILDING US THESE KIND OF RABBIT HUTCHES IN A SEA OF TARMAC 
TO THEIR CREDIT WIMPEY THEIR CHAIRMAN CONTACTED US BROUGHT US INTO A MEETING 
WE THOUGHT THEY MIGHT DO US FOR DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER SO WE BROUGHT A LEGAL ADVISOR 
THEY SAID NO NO WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WORKING WITH YOU WE AGREE WITH A FEW OF THE THINGS 
AND EIGHT YEARS LATER WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THEM 
WE'VE DELIVERED WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE AN AMAZING DEVELOPMENT IN GATESHEAD 
CALLED THE STAITHS WHICH IS EIGHT HUNDRED HOMES 
AND WE'RE DOING ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HOMES JUST OUTSIDE DARTFORD 
AND WE'RE DOING THREE THOUSAND HOMES JUST OUTSIDE EDINBURGH 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT'S BECOME 
WE DO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS WE'RE JUST DESIGNING 
BUT ALSO WHAT ABOUT THIS HOME HOW LONG DID THAT TAKE WELL THAT 
GERALDINE DESIGNED THAT BACK IN ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO 
AND IT ONLY TOOK ABOUT NINE TEN MONTHS TO BUILD 
AND WE WERE THERE LITERALLY ON SITE WHILE IT WAS BEING BUILT 
WE'VE GOT FOUR KIDS AND THEY WERE PART OF THE WHOLE THING 
DECIDING WELL I'D LIKE MY BEDROOM TO BE THERE AND IT WAS KIND OF BUILT ON THE HOOF 
WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THE BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS AND THEN WHEN THE FIRST FLOOR WAS BUILT 
WE WERE JUST LOOKING OVER THE FIELDS AND THE TREES 
AND WE THOUGHT WE'VE GOT TO SPEND OUR TIME UP HERE 
SO WE SWAPPED THE WHOLE HOUSE AROUND 
UPSTAIRS ONE OF THE KIDS SAID IT'S SO TALL NOW WE CAN HAVE A CLIMBING WALL 
SO WE HAD A CLIMBING WALL BUILT WHICH THEY'VE ALL GROWN UP WITH 
AND IT JUST EVOLVED AND IT'S STILL EVOLVING NOW 
YOU KNOW GERALDINE'S JUST THE KIND OF PERSON WHO'S JUST NEVER SATISFIED 
DOES EVERYBODY I NOTICED LISA DID THE OLD POOL TABLE BUT SHE DIDN'T DO THE CLIMBING WALL 
DO PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT TO START WITH THE CLIMBING WALL WHEN THEY COME TO LUNCH 
KIDS ALWAYS WANT TO DO IT ADULTS DON'T BUT WE ALWAYS FORCE THEM TO 
AND WE TRIED TO GET LISA TO DO IT BUT SHE WOULDN'T DO IT ON CAMERA 
WHICH WAS THE BIT OF THE HOUSE THAT STRUCK YOU PAUL 
JUST THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL THE CLEAN LINES EVERYWHERE IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE 
YEAH I THINK WE JUST LIKE WE DON'T LIKE TO COME HOME FROM WORK 
AND HAVE TO CLEAN UP THE GREAT THING ABOUT NOT HAVING MANY ORNAMENTS ABOUT 
IS IT JUST CREATES LESS WORK SO I THINK THE LESS YOU'VE GOT OUT 
AND I JUST LIKE CLEAN THINGS REALLY 
WELL WE'D LIKE TO PRESENT THIS TO THE SURVIVOR OF ROOM FOURTEEN 
NO SIXTEEN WASN'T IT ROOM SIXTEEN 
AND TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US CHEERS 
VERY REFRESHING TO HAVE YOU WITH US 
AND TO SEE THE HOUSE OUR HUGE THANKS TO WAYNE HEMINGWAY 
AND NOW LET'S JOIN LISA STRAIGHT AWAY AT HOUSE NUMBER TWO 
AND REMEMBER THE CLUES ARE THERE AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
ISN'T THIS GLORIOUS I'VE DRIVEN UP THE M. ONE TO HERTFORDSHIRE WHICH IS TRULY BEAUTIFUL 
AND EVEN BEFORE I GO INTO THIS HOUSE I JUST KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE SPECIAL 
JUST LOOK AT THIS FANTASTIC BARBECUE AREA 
THERE'S ROOM FOR PLENTY AND IT'S VERY CONTINENTAL 
WE ALL KNOW THAT AT THE BEST PARTIES EVERYBODY USUALLY ENDS UP IN THE KITCHEN 
IT'S CROWDED BUT COSY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND 
COULD YOU IMAGINE THE KIND OF PARTIES YOU COULD HAVE IN HERE 
AND WHAT FABULOUS DESIGN WITH BOTH ENDS SHAPED LIKE THE PROW OF A BOAT 
AND I'VE HAD A LITTLE COUNT UP AND I RECKON THAT YOU COULD SIT TWENTY AROUND HERE 
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU COULD CALL THIS AREA THE CENTRE STAGE 
SO PERHAPS THE PERSON WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS A BIT OF A PERFORMER 
I COULD JUST IMAGINE KNIVES FLASHING AND GOURMET DELIGHTS APPEARING AS IF BY MAGIC 
BUT JUST HOW MUCH FOOD DO THEY PREPARE HERE 
AND HONESTLY HOW MANY LADLES DO YOU NEED 
AND WHAT CAN YOU CREATE WITH STRAWBERRY VODKA 
THE MOTHER OF ALL HANGOVERS I IMAGINE 
THIS IS A NICE TOUCH A WOOD FIRE BURNING IN THE CORNER 
AND SOMETHING SPANISH DON QUIXOTE AND HIS FAITHFUL MAN SERVANT 
HAVE I GOT YOU TILTING AT WINDMILLS YET 
I ADORE THIS CLOCK 
IT'S VERY FRENCH ORIGINATES FROM PARIS 
BUT THERE'S A VERY SOUTHERN FRENCH INFLUENCE ABOUT IT 
NOW I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS PERSON LIKE ME IS A BIT OF A KEEP FIT FANATIC 
NOW I KNOW HOW TO USE ALL THESE MACHINES AND I CAN CYCLE FOR LIKE HOURS ON END 
DAYS EVEN ON THE BIKE AND GO DIVING 
AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM A DEMON WITH A PUNCHBAG 
ACTUALLY IT REALLY HURTS 
NOW THIS HOUSE DATES BACK TO THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
AND YOU CAN TELL THIS BY THE LOW BEAMS AND DOORWAYS 
SO THIS IS THE DINING ROOM LOOK AT THESE CANDLESTICKS 
VERY DRAMATIC NOW IF YOU CAN FIT TWENTY PEOPLE AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE 
THEN I IMAGINE THAT THIS WOULD BE USED FOR A MORE INTIMATE GATHERING 
LET'S BANG THE GONG AND SEE WHO'S COMING FOR DINNER 
DINNER'S SERVED 
JUST LITTLE OLD ME NO MATES 
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN 
THE CONTINENTAL TOUCH THE PARISIAN TIMEPIECE AND THE DINNER GONG 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LISA 
AND NOW FOR OUR HOME AND STUDIO AUDIENCE 
HERE'S WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
BILL YOU'RE LEADING US OFF NOW 
AM I ARE YOU SURE YES 
WELL IT'S AN INTRIGUING HOUSE 
I MEAN I WAS RATHER WORRIED ABOUT THAT INDOOR GYM 
BECAUSE IT LOOKED A BIT MORE LIKE A TORTURE CHAMBER TO ME 
DID I SEE CHAINS AND LEATHERWEAR OR WAS IT JUST MY IMAGINATION I'M NOT SURE 
NEVERTHELESS OBVIOUSLY WHOEVER IT IS LIKES TO KEEP FIT 
AND THERE'S A VERY BIG FOOD FACTOR GOING ON 
YES 
A VERY BIG FOOD FACTOR DEBRA 
YES THERE IS FOOD EVERYWHERE 
BUT I WAS INTRIGUED ALSO BY THE BOAT 
AND I'M WONDERING IF THAT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING 
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A MEDITERRANEAN FEEL TO THE HOUSE 
WHICH LEADS ME TO WONDER IF THIS PERSON IS BRITISH 
OR WHETHER THEY ARE INDEED SOMEBODY FROM THE SOUTH OF EUROPE 
YUP WELL THAT'S SPOT ON 
GOSH WOULD THAT SOMEBODY BE SPANISH 
NO NO 
NO I THINK NOT RIGHT O. K. 
DEFINITELY CONTINENTAL RIVIERA SOUTHERN FRANCE MAYBE 
LE FRANCAIS IS CORRECT IT HAS TO BE A MAN THOUGH 
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE KITCHEN'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND 
IT'S MASCULINE IT'S A PARTY PLACE AND IT IS MASCULINE 
AND THERE'S KIND OF NO FRILLS NO IT'S NOT FRILLY AT ALL IS IT 
I WAS INTRIGUED BY THE ART IN THE DINING ROOM 
YES IT WAS JUST SPLATTY 
YES TO GIVE IT IT'S HIGH TECHNICAL TERM SPLATTY ART ON THE WALL 
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A CLUE OR ANYTHING 
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IS THAT 
WHY MIGHT THERE BE A GONG 
IF YOU CAN GET TO THE SECRET OF THAT MYSTERY THAT WILL HELP YOU WHY MIGHT THERE BE A GONG 
BECAUSE THERE SHOULD BE A MUSCLY MAN SHOULDN'T THERE AT THE BEGINNING OF A FILM 
J. ARTHUR RANK PRESENTS 
YES THAT'S WHAT THE GYM'S FOR 
WHY MIGHT THERE BE A GONG 
A RESTAURANT A RESTAURANT 
NEARLY SO WHO HAS A RESTAURANT IN THEIR HOME 
SO IF YOU ARE TEACHING PEOPLE AH SO THIS IS 
THAT'S MY GIFT TO YOU YOU ARE VERY KIND OH YES 
THIS IS THEN A MAN WHO'S CLEARLY YOUNG TO MIDDLE AGE 
BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY FIT KEEN ON FITNESS 
VERY INTO COOKING A TRAINING CHEF OF SOME KIND 
IS IT THAT REALLY HANDSOME FRENCH T. V. COOK 
YES YES DARK HAIR YEAH 
YEAH HOW MANY HANDSOME T. V. CHEFS ARE FRENCH VERY HANDSOME 
OOH HE'S BEHIND THERE SO I MUSTN'T GO TOO OVER THE TOP THERE 
MICHEL SOMETHING MICHEL 
JEAN MICHEL JARRE NO THAT'S SOMEBODY ELSE 
NOT JEAN MICHEL JARRE BUT YOU'VE GOT ONE WORD THERE YOU'VE GOT THE JEAN 
JEAN QUITE LOVELY YOU CAN GET THERE 
I KNOW YOU CAN GET THERE JEAN 
COME ON DEBBIE COME ON JEAN CL 
JEAN CHRISTOPHE

LE LE JEAN CHRISTOPHE JEAN CHRISTOPHE 
A B. C. D. E. F. G. H. I J. K. L. M. N. 
JEAN CHRISTOPHE NNN NNN 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT THERE DON'T BE KICKING YOURSELF AGAIN 
HIS NAME AND YOU'LL KICK YOURSELF WHEN I TELL YOU 
I WILL JEAN CHRISTOPHE NOVELLI 
SO WILL YOU COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
JEAN CHRISTOPHE NOVELLI 
MERCI THANK YOU MERCI MERCI 
NOW THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE BACK IN THE NINETIES 
AND AT THAT TIME YOU HAD 
FOUR RESTAURANTS IN LONDON I THINK 
UH UH 
WHICH IS GREAT HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO DO THAT 
WELL I THINK WHEN WE FIRST WHEN WE FIRST MET I USED TO HAVE SEVEN PLACES IN ONE GO 
AND I THINK THE TRAGEDY IS THE FACT THAT I WAS SELF FINANCING MYSELF 
BASICALLY I HAD NO MONEY NO MONEY 
BEFORE I WAS VERY LUCKY TO STRIKE WITH THE FIRST ONE 
AND AUTOMATICALLY IMMEDIATELY I ACTUALLY BOUGHT ANOTHER PLACE AND SO ON 
NON STOP UNTIL THE NUMBER SEVEN 
AND I THINK I SHOULD HAVE PROBABLY 
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT THE PAST AND FOR ME IT'S FINISHED 
YOU JUST MOVE ON IN LIFE 
AND I THINK THE GREAT THING IS 
I DON'T REGRET THE TIME WHERE OBVIOUSLY 
I END UP LOSING EVERYTHING 
BECAUSE I THINK YOU LEARN IN THAT SITUATION 
I KNOW IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT YOU LEARN ABOUT YOURSELF 
AND ALSO MANY DIFFERENT TRICKS IN THE BUSINESS AND THAT HOUSE 
AS WE COULD TELL I GUESS AND LISA WAS SAYING IS FOURTEENTH CENTURY BASED 
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH FOURTEEN IT IS YEAH 
THERE'S TWO PARTS 
THE PART THAT YOU CAME TO FILM WAS EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WHICH WAS INITIALLY ORIGINALLY THE BARN 
AND THE OTHER PART IS FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
AND YOU CAN SEE WHEN I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO BUY THIS PROPERTY 
I WAS GIVEN SOME PICTURES FROM YOU KNOW TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
AND I FEEL VERY PRIVILEGED TO BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE 
LIVING WITH THE SAME LEGACY THE SAME RESPECT AND THE SAME JOIE DE VIVRE 
AND I READ SOMEWHERE THAT I MEAN ALREADY THE ACADEMY IS SEEN 
AS ONE OF THE TWENTY FIVE GREATEST ACADEMIES IN COOKING IN THE WORLD 
THANK YOU IT IS NOT JUST IN BRITAIN BUT IN THE WORLD IT IS YEAH 
IT WAS AWARDED AFTER THREE MONTHS OF OPENING AND THIS WAS TWO YEARS AGO 
AND I HAVE ACTUALLY INJECTED A LOT MORE MONEY TO EXPAND IT 
BUT FOR NOW PEOPLE CAN COME TO ME AND LEARN HANDS ON 
WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT ALL THE TRICKS 
AND IT'S VERY HONEST IT'S LIKE A SHOW 
AND IT'S ALSO VERY LUCRATIVE A LOT OF IDEAS AND PEOPLE SPEND YOU KNOW NEARLY A DAY WITH ME 
I DO NINETY EIGHT PER CENT OF THE SHOW BY MYSELF 
IN FACT WE'VE BEEN RECOGNISED 
AS ONE OF THE MOST ENTERTAINING COOKERY SCHOOLS IN BRITAIN 
WITH A MARK OF NINE OUT OF TEN 
WHICH IS A COMPLIMENT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY COOKING FOR ME IS FUN YOU KNOW IT IS A PLEASURE 
IT SHOULD NOT BE A NECESSITY OR YOU KNOW 
IT SHOULD NOT BE A PAIN IT SHOULD BE A PLEASURE TO EAT AND USING YOUR FIVE SENSES 
AND IN TERMS OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME ARE THEY IN GENERAL 
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WANT TO COOK BETTER 
OR ARE THEY YOUNG CHEFS YOUNG PROFESSIONALS WHO WANT TO DO THEIR JOB BETTER OR ARE THEY BOTH 
IT'S A MIXTURE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMMES 
AND I ACCEPT EVERYBODY THROUGH MY FRONT DOORS 
ANYBODY WHO JUST PURELY WANTS TO SHARE THE EXCITEMENT AND YOU KNOW 
THE PASSION OF COOKING AND THEREFORE WE DON'T ACTUALLY 
WE DO NOT TREAT PEOPLE THEY WAY THEY YOU KNOW ACCORDING TO THE KNOWLEDGE 
WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE I WRITE SOME FANTASTIC PROGRAMMES 
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF MUSIC BASICALLY OR A PLAY 
AND I MAKE SURE THAT I CAN COMBINE EVERYBODY IF THEY WISH TO OR NOT 
UNDER THE SAME ROOF UNDER THE SAME PROGRAMME 
AND AS I SAID IT'S A COMBINATION OF MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS 
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY TO LEARN LITERALLY FROM COOKING 
THERE'S A LOT OF ANECDOTES FROM MY LAST THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND THEN SOME 
THERE'S THINGS I LOVE TO IMPROVISE BECAUSE I ALSO KEEP 
I CAN DO SOMETHING AT THE LAST MINUTE 
AND FOR ME IT'S IMPORTANT YOU CAN IMPROVISE ANYTHING 
AND AS I SAID BY THE TIME I'VE FINISHED WITH THEM THEY END UP WITH A FABULOUS MEMORY 
WELL IT'S A GREAT STORY THANK YOU 
AND WE CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR SECOND CAREER 
TWO GREAT CAREERS AND THIS IS A KEY TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS 
GREAT TO SEE YOU BACK HERE AGAIN AND HERE'S TO THE NEXT TIME 
THANK YOU SO MUCH JEAN CHRISTOPHE NOVELLI 
THANKS TO JEAN CHRISTOPHE AND OF COURSE TO WAYNE HEMINGWAY 
NOT TO MENTION OUR PANEL OH NO NOT TO MENTION THEM PAUL MARTIN 
DEBRA STEPHENSON 
AND BILL TURNBULL 
UNTIL NEXT TIME GOODBYE FOR NOW
