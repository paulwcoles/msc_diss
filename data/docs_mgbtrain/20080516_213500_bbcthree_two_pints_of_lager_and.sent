BURYING MY DOG IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU BEING UNFAITHFUL 
SHE'S RIGHT COME ON LOUISE LET'S TAKE CARE OF THIS FIRST 
THAT EVERYTHING YEAH FROM MUM'S MY CLOTHES ARE AT JANET AND JON'S 
MUM'S GOT MY COLLECTION OF BULBOUS FRUIT YOU COLLECT THEM AS WELL AMAZING WHERE DO YOU KEEP YOURS 
I DON'T BECAUSE IT'S SAD 
WE'LL HAVE TO ESTABLISH SOME GROUND RULES YOU CAN'T BRING HANDICAPPED FRUIT INTO THE HOUSE 
I DON'T WANT RULES TO LIVE BY I PAY HALF THE RENT I CAN DO WHAT I WANT 
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S SELFISH YEAH 
DON'T YOU THINK THAT ALSO GIVES ME LICENCE TO DO WHAT I LIKE I SUPPOSE SO 
I'M CAPABLE OF FAR MORE DISGUSTING THINGS THAN YOU YOU DO WIPE YOUR KNOB ON THE CURTAINS AFTER SEX 
SO LIFE WILL BE EASIER FOR US BOTH IF THERE'S A BIT OF GIVE AND TAKE 
I WON'T BRING THE FRUIT IF YOU STOP THE CRUSTY CURTAINS ACT 
DONNA THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING WHAT ELSE I'M PERFECT TO LIVE WITH IN EVERY OTHER WAY 
YOU SMOKE IT'S PART OF WHO I AM IT'S IN MY BLOOD AND IN YOUR HAIR AND IN YOUR CLOTHES YOU STINK 
YOU SMELL LIKE A BIG RANCID POND 
AT LEAST I KNOW HOW I'M GONNA DIE 
DON'T SMOKE IN THE FLAT NOT EVEN IN THE BATHROOM NO IF I'VE HAD CURRY WE COULD END UP IN WIGAN 
I'LL GO OUT ON THE FIRE ESCAPE TO SMOKE GOOD 
COMPROMISE IS GOOD WE'RE A GOOD COUPLE AS LONG AS YOU GO OUT THERE TO FART 
YOU CAN'T ASK ME TO DO THAT IT'LL TAKE THE FUN OUT OF IT 
WHAT ABOUT IN WINTER IT'D FREEZE ON ITS WAY OUT I'D HAVE AN ICICLE STUCK OUT ME ARSE IT WOULD MELT 
THE NEIGHBOURS DOWNSTAIRS WOULD THINK I WAS A BLOODY WEIRDO 
THIS IS GETTING US NOWHERE I'VE GOT AN IDEA WHAT 
WE'LL EACH WRITE A LIST WHAT KIND OF LIST LIKE A LIST OF DEMANDS ANNOYING HABITS WE WANT RID OF 
WON'T IT HIGHLIGHT THE FLAWS IN OUR RELATIONSHIP 
WE'LL SEE WHICH ONES WE AGREE ON AND THE OTHERS WE COMPROMISE ON 
FROM THAT LITTLE ACORN A MIGHTY OAK OF A RELATIONSHIP WILL GROW 
GAZ YEAH YOU BEEN READING MY WOMAN'S OWN 
WELL IT'S THEM COVER STORIES 
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER TOGETHER AT LAST MY BREASTS ARE TRYING TO KILL ME I THOUGHT IT WAS PORN
