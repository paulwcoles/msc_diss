EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF BRITISH GARDENERS TRY DESPERATELY TO GET A PLACE IN THE YELLOW BOOK 
PUBLISHED ANNUALLY BY THE NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME 
IT LISTS PRIVATE GARDENS THAT CAN OPEN THEIR GATES FOR CHARITY 
THOSE WHO MAKE IT INTO THE YELLOW BOOK WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO OPEN THEIR GARDENS TO THE PAYING PUBLIC 
BUT OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED WHO APPLY YEARLY ONLY HALF GET THROUGH 
STANDARDS ARE HIGH AND THE ASSESSING RUTHLESS 
THERE ISN'T ANY INTEREST IS THERE WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
THIS IS A MONSTROSITY I'M SAYING NO 
IT'S NO FOR THIS YEAR I'M GOING TO SAY NO 
I'LL BE FOLLOWING AVID GARDENERS STRIVING TO TURN THEIR PRIVATE PARADISES INTO OPEN GARDENS' 
TODAY I'M GOING TO BE MEETING TWO AVID GARDENERS WHO HOPE THEIR GARDENS MAKE THE GRADE 
IT'S GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT GARDENING IS VERY THERAPEUTIC YOU FORGET EVERYTHING 
I'M CLOSER TO IT THAN TO THE HOUSE 
WILL TODAY'S GARDENS HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO GET ACCEPTED BY THE PRESTIGIOUS YELLOW BOOK 
I'D BE VERY EXCITED VERY HONOURED 
TODAY'S FIRST GARDEN IS IN SOMERSET 
THIS EARLY EIGHTEENTH CENTURY HUNTING LODGE HAS BEEN EXTENDED INTO THREE ACRES OF LANDSCAPE 
BUT IT'S HIGH UP AND LOOKS OVER FABULOUS VIEWS 
AROUND THE HOUSE IT'S BEEN FORMALLY LANDSCAPED 
BUT THIS GARDEN HAS MUCH MORE THAN TRADITIONAL CLASSIC FEATURES 
THE OWNERS HAVE STAMPED THEIR MARK WITH A FEW CONTEMPORARY TWISTS 
THIS IS LIKE AN OUTDOOR ROOM WITH FORMAL HOLDING HEDGES 
THERE'S THIS STAINLESS STEEL RILL AND A GLASS OBELISK AT THE END 
PUNCTUATING ANOTHER GLORIOUS VIEW 
THIS IDYLLIC GARDEN BELONGS TO FIFTY ONE YEAR OLD LUCY NELSON 
FOR TEN YEARS LUCY HAS DEVELOPED THE SITE WHILE HER CHILDREN GREW UP 
GARDENING IS VERY THERAPEUTIC YOU FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING 
YOU JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE NEEDS OF THE PLANT OR WHAT IS GOING ON 
I THINK THAT SORT OF FORGETFULNESS IS VERY HANDY 
THE THREE ACRE GARDEN HAS THREE PRINCIPAL AREAS 
THE CLASSIC FORMAL BORDERS BY THE HOUSE THE COOL AND CONTEMPORARY RILL GARDEN 
AND A LAKE COMPLETE WITH A MAGNIFICENT FOUNTAIN 
IT'S A PLACE FILLED WITH MEMORIES BUT ONE AREA IS A PLACE OF POIGNANT REFLECTION FOR LUCY 
THERE'S AN OBELISK WHICH WAS GIVEN TO MY HUSBAND AND THERE'S A POEM ON IT I READ AT MY SISTER'S MEMORIAL 
SHE DIED OF CANCER IN TWO THOUSAND ONE 
WE ENGRAVED THE OBELISK WITH THAT POEM IT REMINDS ME OF MY SISTER 
IT'S GOT GOOD MEMORIES FOR ME 
LAST YEAR THE GARDEN TOOK ON HEALING FOCUS FOR LUCY'S DAUGHTER CAMILLA 
AFTER SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH POST VIRAL SYNDROME 
IF I HAD BEEN ILL IN A SMALL CONFINED INDOOR SPACE 
I'D HAVE STAYED ILL FOR LONGER 
TO FEEL THAT SPACE IS GOING ON AND GROWING AND DOING THINGS 
DESPITE WHAT YOU'RE DOING SOMEHOW THAT'S QUITE SOOTHING 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ENERGETIC TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN THEY HAPPEN AROUND YOU ALL THE TIME 
LUCY'S WONDERFULLY PRIVATE GARDEN IS STUNNING I WANT TO KNOW WHY SHE WANTS TO SHARE IT 
WHAT WILL IT MEAN TO YOU TO BE IN THE YELLOW BOOK 
I THINK IT WILL MEAN THERE'S A SEAL OF APPROVAL 
YOU FEEL YOU'RE NOT JUST A JOBBING GARDENER BUT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE 
SOME SORT OF FEELING THAT THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH 
AND IT'S VERY SENTIMENTAL TO YOU 
MY SISTER KATE DIED OF CANCER IN TWO THOUSAND ONE 
SHE LOVED BLUE AND WHITE AND WE HAD BUCKETLOADS OF BLUE AND WHITE FLOWERS AT HER FUNERAL 
WHEN I SIT AMONGST THESE IT REMINDS ME OF HER 
HOW NERVOUS ARE YOU ABOUT THE COUNTY ORGANISER COMING 
SNOOPING AROUND YOUR GARDEN AND ASSESSING YOU AS GOOD ENOUGH OR NOT IS THAT A NERVOUS THING 
IT IS I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD ENOUGH IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS YES I AM NERVOUS 
THIS GARDEN LOOKS PRETTY IMMACULATE TO ME BUT IT'S THREE ACRES 
AND THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME PROBLEM AREAS WITHIN IT 
THE POND LOOKS FABULOUS BUT THEY'VE GOT THIS NEW DUCK HOUSE WHICH TO ME SPOILS THE VIEW 
THAT NEEDS SCREENING AND THINKING ABOUT 
ANOTHER PROBLEM AREA MIGHT BE THE WOODLAND IT'S SO WET IT'S LIKE A BOG 
YOU CAN'T HAVE POSH LADIES COMING HERE WITH THEIR HIGH HEELS IT'S A BIG NO NO 
ARE THESE A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR LUCY AND HER DREAM OF GETTING INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
THE JUDGE IS ASSISTANT COUNTY ORGANISER FOR SOMERSET ALISON HIGHNAM 
ALISON'S GARDEN REFLECTS HER IMPECCABLE TASTE AND LUCY'S FATE IS HANGING IN THE BALANCE 
THE GARDEN I PREFER PERSONALLY IS A GARDEN WITH A KIND ENTRANCE 
SOFTER COLOURS THEN NICE HARD BRIGHT COLOURS LOTS OF NICE PLACES TO SIT 
HEALTH AND SAFETY IS ALSO VERY MUCH TOP OF THE LIST 
OUR SECOND GARDEN TODAY IS IN HERTFORDSHIRE 
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD SIZE GARDEN 
IT'S FIFTEEN ACRES IN TOTAL DIVIDED UP SIMPLY WITH MATURE BEECH HEDGES 
AND THE MANY SHRUBS AND PERENNIALS REFLECT EVERY SEASON 
THIS REMARKABLE GARDEN IS A TRUE LABOUR OF LOVE 
AND REFLECTS TWENTY THREE YEARS OF CAREFUL PLANNING AND DESIGN BY FIFTY EIGHT YEAR OLD SALLY POOL 
IF I GOT INTO THE YELLOW BOOK I'D BE VERY EXCITED VERY HONOURED 
THE BACKBONE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL COUNTRY GARDEN IS FORMED BY A SERIES OF MATURE BEECH HEDGES 
IMMACULATE LAWNS AND BEDS BRIMMING WITH HERBACEOUS PERENNIALS 
AND AN ORCHARD AND VEGETABLE PATCH 
ORIGINALLY A FIELD FULL OF DOCK AND THISTLE SALLY'S WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD TO CREATE A GARDEN 
IN PERFECT KEEPING WITH HER ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTIES HOUSE 
I FIND IT VERY CREATIVE AND VERY SELF ABSORBING 
AND I LOVE PROPAGATING LOTS OF PLANTS FROM ONE PLANT 
AND SWAPPING PLANTS I JUST ENJOY IT 
SALLY'S HUSBAND JONATHAN KNOWS ONLY TOO WELL WHERE HE FALLS ON HER LIST OF PRIORITIES 
THE FIRST IS HER SON TIMOTHY THE SECOND HER DOG TOSCA AND THE THIRD HER GARDEN 
AND UNFORTUNATELY NOW TIMOTHY'S IN AUSTRALIA AND THE DOG'S DEAD SO THE GARDEN IS NOW NUMBER ONE 
WHEN DID YOU FIRST GET INTO GARDENING 
WHEN I HAD THE CHILDREN AND HAD TO STAY AT HOME 
THEN I TOOK AN INTEREST IN GARDENING WE MOVED HERE TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO AND IT WAS A BLANK CANVAS 
THIS WAS JUST PLOUGHED FIELD AND I'VE BUILT IT UP NOW IT'S A PROPER GARDEN A MATURE GARDEN 
PLENTY OF ROOM TO PLAY WITH YES 
WHEN IT CAME TO LAYING OUT THE DESIGN DID YOU GET A PROFESSIONAL 
I DID A GARDEN DESIGN COURSE AND THEY USED MY GARDEN AS THE COUNTRY GARDEN 
SO I WAS ABLE TO DESIGN IT WITH HELP I'VE PUT IT INTO FRUITION 
SO WHY PUT IT INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
WELL I CAN HELP TO MAKE MONEY FOR CHARITY 
I'M QUITE HAPPY TO YES SHOULD I BE SELECTED GOSH 
WHAT IF YOU DON'T GET IN THAT WAS A FACIAL EXPRESSION 
WILL YOU BE DISAPPOINTED 
WELL YES PROBABLY I WOULD BE I THINK 
WOULD YOU TRY AGAIN YES KEEP GOING YEAH 
SHE'LL BE EXCITED IF SHE GETS IN 
IT WILL BE AN ACHIEVEMENT OR A RECOGNITION OF ONE IF SHE GETS IN 
THERE ARE SOME PROBLEM AREAS HOWEVER THESE LAVENDERS GET REALLY LEGGY OVER TIME 
THE WHOLE AREA LACKS A BIT OF HEIGHT WILL THE COUNTY ORGANISER PICK UP ON THESE POINTS 
AND STOP SALLY FROM GETTING INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
THE PERSON SALLY AND HER GARDEN WILL HAVE TO ENTHUSE IS EXPERIENCED COUNTY ORGANISER EDWINA ROBARTS 
THE WHOLE SCHEME OF THINGS HAS TO BE RIGHT LOOKING UP AND LOOKING DOWN 
AND LOOKING INTO THE DISTANCE SO YOUR EYES DON'T DRIFT AROUND AND ARE TAKEN ROUND THE GARDEN 
EDWINA'S GARDEN IS FULL OF HEIGHT DEPTH AND INTEREST I HOPE THIS DOESN'T SPELL DISASTER 
FOR SALLY'S YELLOW BOOK ASPIRATIONS 
TODAY WE FIND OUT IF EITHER OF OUR GARDENS HAS GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO GET INTO THE COVETED YELLOW BOOK 
IN SOMERSET ASSISTANT COUNTY ORGANISER ALISON HIGHNAM IS ON HER WAY TO ASSESS LUCY'S GARDEN 
HELLO LUCY I'M ALISON WILL THE WOODLAND PARK BE TOO MUCH OF A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE FOR HER 
MEANWHILE IN HERTFORDSHIRE EDWINA ROBARTS HAS ARRIVED AT SALLY'S 
BUT HAS THE GARDEN GOT WHAT IT TAKES 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO LOOK ROUND LOVELY 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS REALLY COUNT AND EDWINA DOESN'T SEEM THAT THRILLED 
THIS LOOKS AS THOUGH IT'S SLIGHTLY PAST ITS SELL BY DATE 
DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS FOR IT I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO CUT IT RIGHT BACK DOWN TO THE BOTTOM 
AND HOPEFULLY IT WOULD GROW UP AGAIN IN SOMERSET THE COUNTY ORGANISER IS NOT WASTING TIME 
AND HEADS FOR THE LAKE BUT SOMETHING'S CAUGHT HER EYE THIS LOOKS A LITTLE BARE 
I THOUGHT WE'D PLANT SOME IRISES AND SKUNK CABBAGE YES THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA 
UNDETERRED IN HERTFORDSHIRE SALLY CONTINUES WITH THE TOUR BUT EDWINA DOES NOT MISS A THING 
THIS AREA OVER HERE SEEMS TO BE RATHER A MESS 
RATHER A LOT OF IVY WHICH IS NOT THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF THINGS 
IT'S NOT BUT IN THE SUMMER THE GERANIUMS COME UP AND TEND TO HIDE ALL THAT 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO CONTROL 
LUCY'S DREAMS OF OPENING HER GARDEN ARE HEADED DOWN A SLIPPERY SLOPE 
IT'S RATHER SLIPPERY I KNOW 
TAKE CARE 
THINGS AREN'T LOOKING ANY BETTER IN HERTFORDSHIRE 
WILL EDWINA'S LATEST OBSERVATION LEAVE SALLY'S GARDEN FALLING SHORT OF YELLOW BOOK EXPECTATIONS 
IT'S A VERY LARGE AREA BUT RATHER LACKING IN HEIGHT 
I DO AGREE ACTUALLY I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO PUT METAL HOOPS OVER LIKE THAT 
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO REALLY AFFORD THEM WHAT'S THIS MONSTROSITY DON'T YOU LIKE IT 
NO IT'S TOTALLY INCONGRUOUS IN THIS SETTING IS IT OH DEAR 
IT'S DECISION TIME HAVE OUR GARDENS BEEN UP TO SCRATCH FOR THE YELLOW BOOK 
THE FIRST THING THAT YOU SEE ON ENTERING THE GARDEN IS THAT REALLY RATHER SCRUFFY JASMINE 
I THINK IT NEEDS DEALING WITH 
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT IF I CUT IT TO ABOUT A FOOT 
WE HAVE A SMALL PROBLEM IT'S THAT DUCK SHED 
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO SPARSE 
IT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED 
WHERE THE VISTA GOES THROUGH TO THE LARGE LAWN WITH THE LAVENDER HEDGES 
IT'S DISTINCTLY LACKING IN HEIGHT 
PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT IN SOME HOOPS THAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT YES 
THAT WAS MY PLAN ORIGINALLY BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO IT 
THAT WOULD CERTAINLY HELP A LOT 
THEN WHEN WE WENT DOWN INTO THE WOODED AREA I DID FEEL THE MUD WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO SQUISHY 
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT 
ALL IN ALL ONCE THE BORDERS HAVE GROWN UP AND THE FLOWERS ARE BURGEONING 
I'M SURE IT WILL LOOK FANTASTIC 
SO IS IT A YES OR A NO FOR SALLY 
WE'D BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU OH I SAY REALLY WOW 
OH GOSH THANK YOU 
THAT'S AMAZING IT'S EXCITING THANK YOU 
SHE'S MADE IT AND SALLY WILL BE OPENING HER GARDEN TO THE PUBLIC IN TWELVE WEEKS' TIME 
I JUST FEEL AMAZED THAT I GOT INTO THE N. G.S I CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY GARDEN'S GOOD ENOUGH BUT THERE WE GO 
IF I CAN MAKE MONEY FOR CHARITY AND GIVE PEOPLE PLEASURE I'M HAPPY 
AND FOR LUCY COMING ON ROUND INTO THE FRONT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A SUPERB PLACE 
YOU JUST REALLY MUST OPEN 
AND WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU THANK YOU 
I'M SURE WE'RE GOING TO IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING FOR A FANTASTIC CHARITY 
SO THANK YOU THANK YOU LUCY 
LUCY'S TANTALISING GARDEN HAS WON THE HEART OF THE COUNTY ORGANISER 
BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT TO DO 
SHE'S DRAWN MY ATTENTION TO THE BITS I NEED TO WORK ON 
YEAH I'M PLEASED NERVOUS AND APPREHENSIVE 
BOTH OF TODAY'S GARDENS HAVE A LOT TO ACHIEVE BEFORE THROWING OPEN THEIR GATES TO THE PUBLIC 
IN HERTFORDSHIRE SALLY'S GOT SOME GRAND PLANS TO ADD HEIGHT BUT WE CAN'T QUITE SEE EYE TO EYE 
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN I SAW A GARDEN LIKE THIS IN SCOTLAND 
AND IT HAD HOOPS OVER DIAGONALLY OVER AND I'D LIKE TO DO THAT 
SO IT LOOKS GREAT FROM A HOT AIR BALLOON IT WOULD LOOK LIKE A HOT CROSS BUN IMAGINE IT 
I'M THINKING ABOUT GROUND LEVEL IT WILL BE EIGHT FEET TALL 
AND YOU CAN WALK THROUGH IT THAT'S RIGHT 
WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE GARDEN MORE HEIGHT ON THIS LAWN 
OH YES I'VE ORDERED SIX ROSES ONE THERE AND TWO ALONG THAT HEDGE 
DOWN THERE AND ALSO ALONG THE COPPER BEECH NOT ON THIS SIDE I CAN'T GROW ANYTHING THERE 
BUT YOU'RE NOT CONCERNED THAT I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SIDE 
SHOULD I BE IT'S YOUR GARDEN 
I THINK IT'LL BE FINE YOU'RE IN THE BOOK GOOD LUCK WITH THE OPEN DAY 
ARE YOU MAKING TEA AND COFFEE NO THE HOSPICE ARE DOING THAT THEY DO THE WHOLE LOT 
I'M SURE IT'LL BE A GREAT DAY THANK YOU I HOPE SO 
THE COUNTY ORGANISER PICKED UP ON THE SCRUFFY LAVENDER AND JASMINE AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
IF SALLY DOESN'T REPLACE THESE THEY NEED A GOOD PRUNE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE GET STRESSED OUT ABOUT WHEN EXACTLY TO PRUNE SHRUBS AND CLIMBERS 
AS A RULE OF THUMB THE TIME IS AFTER FLOWERING THAT'S WHEN TO GET STUCK IN THERE 
IT CAN PUT GROWTH ON AND IT'LL FLOWER NEXT YEAR 
TWO WEEKS LATER AND I'M BACK IN SOMERSET TO SEE HOW LUCY'S GETTING ON 
CONGRATULATIONS LUCY YOU MADE IT ISN'T IT AMAZING NOT AT ALL 
IT'S A FABULOUS GARDEN YOU'RE VERY KIND THERE'S A LOT TO DO 
AND I'M A BIT NERVOUS ABOUT ALL THE EYESORES 
LUCY'S REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT WILDLIFE AND ONE OF HER FAVOURITE THINGS IS THE DUCKS 
BUT THEIR NEW HOUSE IS A BIT OF AN EYESORE 
MIGHT HAVE TO CUSTOMISE THE ROOF 
HAVE YOU DONE THIS BEFORE I'VE DONE A COUPLE IN MY TIME 
THAT WON'T TAKE ANY WEIGHT YOU'VE GOT TWO OPTIONS 
WITH TIME BEING OF THE ESSENCE I WOULD SUGGEST CREATING A GREEN ROOF USING SEDUM MATTING 
LUCY SHOULD LINE THE ROOF WITH A PIECE OF PLYWOOD WRAPPED IN WATERPROOF BUTYL LINING 
A GREEN ROOF IS LIKE A LIVING CARPET OUTDOORS IT'S DROUGHT TOLERANT AND ATTRACTS WILDLIFE 
UNFORTUNATELY I'VE RUN OUT OF TIME 
BUT LUCY'S KEEN TO CRACK ON 
YOU'VE GOT THE FRONT TO THE HOUSE 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT YES DO YOU NEED YOUR TOOLS I NEED TO SCREW IT DOWN NOW 
I'LL GET RID OF THESE AND LEAVE YOU TO IT I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL WHEN THE SEDUM'S ARRIVED 
ALL RIGHT BYE BYE 
SALLY'S BEEN WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD AND THE GARDEN'S TAKING SHAPE 
BUT A GARDENER'S WORK IS NEVER DONE 
I'M NEARLY READY FOR SUNDAY I'VE GOT TWO WHOLE DAYS TO FINISH OFF 
I'VE GOT TO DO MY TUBS THEY'RE NOT VERY GOOD 
THEY'RE BETTER IN SEPTEMBER BUT THEY'LL BE NEAT AND TIDY 
SALLY IS STILL CONCERNED ABOUT SOME ASPECTS OF THE GARDEN 
BUT WITH THE NEW FRAME ADDING HEIGHT AND INTEREST AND EVERYTHING IN FULL BLOOM IT'S COMING TOGETHER 
THE WORST PART IS THE FRONT 
I ALWAYS HAVE TROUBLE THERE BECAUSE IT'S VERY DRY AND SUNNY SO THINGS ARE NOT VERY GOOD 
OVER THERE 
ON THE DAY THE BEST THINGS ARE GOING TO BE SEEING SOME OF MY FRIENDS HERE 
AND SEEING GARDEN ENTHUSIASTS PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SEE MY GARDEN I HOPE THEY'RE GOING TO COME 
I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE FINE 
THE PLANTS ARE LOOKING AMAZING I JUST HOPE IN A WEEK'S TIME THEY HAVEN'T ALL GONE OVER 
MEANWHILE IN SOMERSET THE GARDEN OPENING IS JUST DAYS AWAY AND THE PRESSURE TO GET IT RIGHT 
IS STARTING TO TAKE ITS TOLL ON EVERYONE INCLUDING GARDENER MANDY 
WE'RE JUST KIND OF RUNNING AROUND TO SORT OUT THE LAST BIT OF WEEDING 
JUST TWEAKING LITTLE THINGS AND MAKING SURE THEY'RE TIDY 
DEADHEADING A FEW TULIPS THAT HAVE GONE OVER 
LUCY'S GETTING A BIT WORRIED ABOUT EVERYTHING 
I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO DO ANY COOKING ENTIRELY MY FAULT 
I'VE BROUGHT SOME BISCUITS THEY'LL HAVE TO MANAGE 
IS THERE A NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME TOP TEN DO YOU GET A STAR FOR TEAS 
OR A MICHELIN STAR WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET ONE DEFINITELY NOT 
A FEW DAYS AGO SHE WAS HAVING SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AWFUL PANICS ABOUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARRIVING 
FOR LUCY ONE AREA IN PARTICULAR HAS TO BE FAULTLESS FOR THE BIG DAY AND SHE'S HARD AT WORK 
MAKING SURE EVERYTHING IS JUST SO 
I'M GETTING ALL THE ALGAE OFF THIS RILL 
WHICH WE PUT IN IN TWO THOUSAND ONE MY SISTER WAS DYING OF CANCER THAT YEAR 
THAT I READ AT HER MEMORIAL SERVICE 
WE'VE GOT THESE STONES WHICH ARE TO COMMEMORATE THE CHILDREN'S BIRTHDAYS 
AND ONE TO COMMEMORATE KATE'S LIFE WHICH IS REALLY NICE 
AND SO I MUST GET IT CLEANED UP FOR TOMORROW GET IT SHINY 
IN HERTFORDSHIRE SALLY'S OPEN DAY IS FINALLY HERE 
AND SOON THE GARDEN WILL BE BRIMMING WITH VISITORS WE HOPE 
THERE'S JUST ONE SMALL PROBLEM 
NOW THE OPEN DAY HAS FINALLY ARRIVED I FEEL SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED 
WE BOTH WOKE UP RATHER EARLY THIS MORNING IT WAS QUARTER TO SIX 
AND WE STARTED MAKING PLANS FOR THE WET I'M AFRAID THAT IN THIS WEATHER 
I DOUBT MANY PEOPLE WILL TURN UP 
LAST WEEK WHEN THE SUN WAS SHINING THE OPEN GARDEN GOT THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN HERTFORDSHIRE 
THE WEEK BEFORE WHEN IT RAINED THEY GOT TWENTY 
BUT SALLY'S DETERMINED THE RAIN WON'T DAMPEN HER SPIRITS AND CRACKS ON WITH HER PREPARATIONS 
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I WAS LAST HERE AND IT'S BEEN TRANSFORMED 
I HAD REAL TROUBLE ENVISAGING HOW SALLY PLANNED TO SOLVE THE LACK OF HEIGHT 
I DIDN'T VISUALISE THIS 
THE HEIGHT MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE OH YES 
IT SUITS THE GARDEN PERFECTLY A NICE CLASSICAL SIMPLE SHAPE 
IT ADDS HEIGHT AND VOLUME AND DRAWS THE EYE THROUGH TO THE END BRILLIANT THANK YOU I'M THRILLED 
SALLY'S JUST ABOUT TO OPEN HER GARDEN IT'S GOING TO BE FANTASTIC 
I HOPE LOTS OF PEOPLE TURN UP THIS GARDEN IS WELL WORTH A VISIT 
DESPITE THE WET WEATHER VISITORS JUST KEEP COMING 
WE ALWAYS ENJOY OURSELVES LOOKING AROUND OTHER PEOPLE'S GARDENS 
IT'S SAD THAT PEOPLE PUT IN SO MUCH WORK AND EFFORT AND ON THEIR VERY FIRST TIME OF OPENING 
THEY HAVE AN AFTERNOON LIKE THIS 
SOMEONE GOES TO THIS TROUBLE AND THE AMOUNT OF WORK THEY'VE DONE TO GET IT READY 
THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS COME OUT RAIN DOESN'T MATTER 
SO THE PAYING PUBLIC LOVE IT BUT WHAT DOES EDWINA MAKE OF IT 
HUGE IMPROVEMENT SINCE I CAME LAST 
THE METAL STRUCTURE OVER THE LAVENDER BED HAS JUST RAISED 
ONE'S EYES TO THE SKY SO YOU CAN SEE MORE ALL AROUND 
IT CONCENTRATES THE EYE IT'S SO DISAPPOINTING IT'S AN AWFUL DAY AS IT LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL 
I SAW IT YESTERDAY WHEN IT WAS SUNNY AND EVERYTHING WAS LOOKING FANTASTIC AND BURGEONING 
I'VE ENJOYED THE DAY NOT AS MUCH AS I WOULD HAVE IF THE SUN HAD BEEN SHINING BUT IT'S BEEN O. K. 
NOW IT HAS STARTED TO EASE OFF A BIT AND WE'VE HAD A LOT MORE PEOPLE THAN I EVER THOUGHT WE'D GET 
WE'RE R. A I. S. E. D. FOUR FIFTY THAT'S FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY IN TOTAL THAT'S REALLY GOOD ON A DAY LIKE THIS 
THAT'S PRETTY STAGGERING 
HAS IT BEEN A GOOD DAY FOR YOU YES IT HAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD CONSIDERING THE WEATHER 
I WAS WORRIED NOBODY WOULD COME BUT THEY DID REALLY SUPPORTIVE 
WHAT WAS YOUR FAVOURITE PART OF IT MY FAVOURITE PART 
I THINK IT WAS STANDING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRIVE AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO ARRIVE 
OR IF ANYBODY WOULD ARRIVE AND THEN ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER PEOPLE STARTED TO ARRIVE 
IT WAS JUST GREAT FUN 
REGARDLESS OF THE RAIN SALLY'S FIRST OPEN DAY WAS A ROARING SUCCESS 
AND I HOPE SHE'LL OPEN FOR MANY MORE YEARS TO COME 
IT'S EARLY MAY IN SOMERSET AND IT'S THE MORNING OF LUCY'S FIRST OPEN DAY 
DESPITE ALL HER HARD WORK SHE'S BUSY WITH LAST MINUTE CHORES 
ALL THE HARD WORK REALLY SHOWS 
THE DUCK HOUSE NOW BLENDS PERFECTLY WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS 
THE MUDDY WOODLAND WALK HAS BEEN MULCHED AND THE ALLEY IS LOOKING FANTASTIC 
OH MY GOD 
LUCY'S SISTER'S MEMORIAL RILL HAS BROKEN DOWN 
IF I WAS THE PANICKING KIND I'D BEGIN TO THROW MY TOYS OUT BUT THERE'S THINGS YOU CAN'T CHANGE 
THIS HAS BEEN SENT TO TRY ME 
AND I WILL JUST HAVE TO APOLOGISE TO PEOPLE 
I HOPE THIS ISN'T A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME 
LUCY'S ABOUT TO OPEN HER BELOVED GARDEN FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME 
I REALLY HOPE THERE'S A QUEUE AND PEOPLE POUR IN TO SEE IT 
HI 
I NEEDN'T HAVE WORRIED FOR LONG DESPITE IT BEING A WEEKDAY THE PUBLIC ARE OUT IN DROVES 
LUCY'S DAUGHTER CAMILLA IS BACK IN FULL HEALTH AND IS ON HAND TO HELP 
YOU MUST GIVE THEM THIS I AM 
YOU KEEP INTERFERING 
THE GARDEN IS BRIMMING WITH VISITORS BUT DO THEY LIKE IT 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL AND IN SUCH A NATURAL SETTING 
EVERYWHERE YOU STAND ALL THE FLOWERS ARE IN VIEW SO YOU GET THIS WONDERFUL PICTURE 
SO THE GARDEN IS A HIT BUT WHAT DOES ALISON THINK OF IT 
I THINK IT'S FABULOUS THE COLOUR IS JUST HOW IT SHOULD BE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR 
WHEN I CAME IN WINTERTIME IT LOOKED SO FLAT BUT NOW 
WOW IT'S REALLY LIVELY 
NOBODY COULD BE MORE THRILLED THAN HEAD GARDENER MANDY ABOUT IT 
THIS IS FANTASTIC I NEVER EXPECTED SO MANY PEOPLE I THINK I KNOW THERE'S NO WEEDS THERE 
SO YEAH IT'S QUITE GOOD 
LUCY HOW DO YOU THINK IT WENT 
I WAS REALLY PLEASED IT WAS SO NICE TO SEE PEOPLE COMING IN 
IT WASN'T JUST FRIENDS OF MINE LOTS OF PEOPLE CAME AND ENJOYED IT 
NEXT TIME THERE WILL BE ONE 
WELL I THINK SO I THINK I FEEL ENCOURAGED BY PEOPLE'S COMMENTS 
IT'S GOOD TO SHARE IT WITH PEOPLE 
LUCY'S FIRST OPEN DAY HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDING SUCCESS 
SHE'S HAD NEARLY ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND RAISED ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOR CHARITY 
SHE CAN NOW PROUDLY DECLARE HERSELF AS PART OF THE PRESTIGIOUS N. G.S
