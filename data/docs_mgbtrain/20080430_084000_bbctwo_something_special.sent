IF ONE OF US GETS LOST OR SEPARATED FROM THE OTHERS 
FIRST WE'LL HAVE A CHAT AND WORK OUT A PLAN BEFORE WE START SHOPPING 
HAVE ANY OF YOU EVER GOT LOST 
I HAVE AT THE ZOO WITH MY DAD AND MY BROTHER 
WE WERE LOOKING AT THE MONKEYS THEY WERE FAB AROONI 
BUT WHEN I LOOKED AROUND I COULDN'T FIND MY DAD OR BROTHER 
THEY MUST HAVE GONE TO LOOK AT SOMETHING ELSE WERE YOU WORRIED 
A BIT BUT WE'D WORKED OUT WHAT TO DO IF ANY OF US GOT LOST WHAT 
THERE WAS A RUBBISH BIN IN THE SHAPE OF A PENGUIN 
IF WE GOT LOST WE HAD TO GO THERE AND WAIT 
I ASKED SOMEONE WORKING THERE TO TAKE ME TO THE PENGUIN BIN 
AND IT WORKED MY DAD AND MY BROTHER FOUND ME
