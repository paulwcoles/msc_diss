JOHN'S GETTING CHASTISED DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS A POKE IN THE RIBS DO N. T. PO KE M. E. 
THE DOORS INTO THE GARDEN THIS IS POSH 
I CAN IMAGINE SITTING HERE WITH THE PATIO HERE AND THE VEG PATCH AND THEN THE FLOWERS IN THE BACKGROUND 
I THINK WE ARE LISTENING TO TWO PEOPLE THAT ARE FALLING IN LOVE NOT WITH EACH OTHER BUT WITH A PROPERTY 
TWO PEOPLE FALLING IN LOVE WITH A PROPERTY AND ONE PERSON WHO'S SPOILING THE AMBIENCE BE QUIET 
OH I CAN SEE MYSELF HERE I THOUGHT YOU COULD I COULD 
IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY BOTH LIKE IT WHICH IS JUST AS WELL 
BECAUSE IT'S OUR LAST CHANCE TO GET OURSELVES OUT OF THESE DREAD THE THOUGHT COME ON 
WOULD I BE RIGHT IN SAYING THAT YOU LIKE THIS PROPERTY I DO 
DO YOU AS A BIG FELLA DO YOU THINK YOU CAN ACTUALLY GROW IN THIS HOUSE 
WHAT TO LIKE IT TO GROW IN THIS HOUSE IF EVER THERE WAS A MIS PHRASED SENTENCE THAT WAS ONE 
GET ON WITH YOUR CHORES I'M PRESSING MY SEAMS 
LOUISE EARLIER MENTIONED THE FACT THAT SHE MIGHT WANT TO START A FAMILY 
YEAH GET A COUPLE OF BIG ONES 
WILL IT BE BIG ENOUGH FOR THAT COULD GO UPWARDS PERHAPS RIGHT 
THAT BRINGS ME TO EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT 
ROOM IN THE ROOF YOUR NEIGHBOURS ON THE EAST WING AND YOUR NEIGHBOURS ON THE WEST WING HAVE DORMER WINDOWS 
THEY'VE CONVERTED THE ATTIC THIS BUNGALOW DO YOU MIND 
COMES WITH FULL PLANNING PERMISSION ALREADY GRANTED FOR A ROOM IN THE ROOF EXCELLENT 
EXACTLY YOU COULD EXPAND HERE 
LOUISE CAN HAVE HER BAMBINOS 
WOULD THAT KEEP YOU HAPPY 
WHAT THE EXPANSION HAVE YOU TWO ACTUALLY FINISHED GASSING 
HAVE YOU FINISHED YOUR IRONING I'VE PRESSED MY SEAMS 
I'M THE ONE THAT WEARS THE TROUSERS IN THIS RELATIONSHIP 
HE HASN'T EVEN GOT ANY HAIR ON HIS LEGS 
I'M GOING TO GO AND HAVE A WORD WITH LOUISE AND MOCKERY DOMINIC IS A VERY UGLY THING 
LOUISE YOU LIKE THE HOUSE BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GARDEN 
ALL WE'VE GOT HERE REALLY LET'S FACE IT IS A LOT OF FRESH SOD UNDERFOOT 
I'M DISAPPEARING INTO THE TUNDRA 
I'LL HOLD YOU UP DON'T WORRY I'M GETTING LOUISE'S VEGETABLE PLOT READY FOR HER 
THAT'S GREAT DOMINIC JUST KEEP ON WORKING 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE NO LAWN NO PLANTS NOTHING 
THIS IS YOURS TO CULTIVATE AN ABSOLUTE GENESIS COULD HAPPEN HERE 
BUT WHAT I'M GOING TO SUGGEST AGAIN IS YOU HAVE OUTBUILDINGS HERE 
THEY'RE LACKLUSTRE TO BE HONEST I THINK I'LL DO A FEATURE THERE 
GET RID OF THEM AND PLANT YOURSELF UP EVEN MORE STUFF 
EXPAND THE GARDEN EXPAND YOUR SPACE 
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET STUCK IN WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS THE WEEDS 
TALKING OF WEEDS HOW ARE YOU DOING DOM 
HEY

I WANT JOHN TO STAND IN THAT HOLE 
THEN WE'LL BE ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT 
GUESS WHAT IT'S GUESS THE PRICE TIME 
OH NO I'M GOING TO LOSE AGAIN 
DON'T BE SO NEGATIVE ADMITTEDLY YOU HAVEN'T GOT ONE RIGHT YOU HAVE LOST THE LAST TWO 
WELL I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PRICES AROUND HERE 
OH LOOK THERE'S A BIT OF A CHINK IN YOUR ARMOUR 
I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE I KNOW THE AREA A BIT BETTER THAN JOHN YOU GO FIRST 
I THINK BECAUSE IT'S A WILD CARD 
I'M GOING TO GO FOR A REALLY WILD GUESS AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THOUSAND 
A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE WHAT D'YOU RECKON BIG FELLA ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
LOUISE FINALLY SHE GOT ONE IT'S FIFTY QUID SHORT OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND 
CAN WE BLAG THESE OFF NOW HOW ABOUT THESE OFF NOW NO NOT YET NO 
GIVE US THE KEY 
O. K. NOW BOYS AND GIRLS WE DO NEED TO FOCUS JUST FOR A SECOND 
WE'VE SEEN THREE DELECTABLE PROPERTIES OF WHICH I THINK YOU LIKED ALL THREE OF THEM 
WE NEED TO MAKE A BIG DECISION ABOUT WHICH ONE YOU'D LIKE TO AS WE SAY 
TRY BEFORE YOU BUY WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE GOT PICTURES OF ALL OF THEM ON THE LAPTOP 
I'M GOING TO GIVE THAT TO YOUR MISSUS THE PICTURES OF ALL THE PROPERTIES ARE ON THERE 
WORK OUT WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO TEST DRIVE AND WE'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER 
CAN I ASK A QUICK QUESTION ARE THESE EASY TO SWITCH ON AS I'M NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTERS 
I'VE HAD NO COMPLAINTS YET THAT'S O. K. LOVELY 
IS EVERYTHING CHAOS AROUND HERE 
TRUST ME IT'S CHAOS IT IS CHAOS 
WHILE THEY'RE OFF MAKING THAT TOUGH DECISION 
HERE'S A REMINDER OF THE PROPERTIES 
I THINK I OFFERED THEM GREAT THINGS WITH MY CHOICE 
A FOUR BEDROOM SEMI DETACHED 
IT HAS HIGH CEILINGS EXTRA LARGE VEG PLOT 
HUGE BEDROOMS AND IT'S GOT IT ALL AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED FOR 
I DOUBT IT BECAUSE THEY'LL PROBABLY GO FOR MY THREE BEDROOM SEMI 
IT'S GOT TWO WHOPPING SIZED BEDROOMS FOR THEIR JUMBO SIZED BED 
A CONSERVATORY FOR EXTRA SPACE AND A SEPARATE DINING ROOM AT 
BUT DOM WILL OUR WILD CARD WIN THE DAY 
THIS TWO BEDROOM BUNGALOW SET IN MELTON MOWBRAY 
IS IMMACULATELY FURNISHED SMALL FROM THE OUTSIDE A TARDIS ON THE IN 
AND WITH A GREAT VEGETABLE PLOT IT'S JUST UNDER THEIR BUDGET AT 
THAT'S VALUE FOR MONEY 
ALL RIGHT THAT'S PROPERTY ONE WITH THE BIG DRIVE 
AND THE PINK SIGN OUTSIDE AND THE LARGE GARDEN 
THE BEDROOM AT THE TOP 
I'M UNCONVINCED THAT THE BED WILL GO IN THERE BECAUSE IT'S LONG 
THE GARDEN WAS THE BEST THING THE CAR PARKING FOR ALL YOUR THINGS THE BOAT AND STUFF 
PROPERTY NUMBER TWO THAT'S A REALLY NICE HOUSE 
IT'S GOING TO BE A MONSTER OF A DECISION 
BUT HAVE WE DELIVERED THEM A HOME 
I HOPE SO OTHERWISE IS SHE GOING TO LET US OUT OF THESE HANDCUFFS 
THE WILD CARD IMPRESSED ME THE KITCHEN WAS NICE ALL THE NICE TOPS 
THE BEDROOM WAS BIG ENOUGH 
I'VE GOT MY MIND MADE UP ALREADY 
HAVE YOU I THINK SO YES 
HERE WE ARE YOUR CHOICE 
THE WILD CARD THE BUNGALOW 
WHOEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I WOULDN'T HAVE 
LOOK AT THAT SMILE ON YOUR FACE ALL RIGHT THEN WHY DID YOU 
THERE'S THE PARKING AND THE BED IT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT THE BED WILL FIT IN 
THE BED WAS VERY IMPORTANT WASN'T IT 
WHY WAS IT GOOD FOR YOU 
IT WAS THE BEDROOM TO START WITH AND ALSO IT'S A NICE AREA FOR MY LITTLE CATS 
RIGHT AS LONG AS THE CATS ARE O. K. 
YEAH THAT'S IT IT'S TEST DRIVE TIME 
THIS IS WHERE WE LEAVE YOU TO SPEND SOME TIME IN THE HOUSE 
BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT WE HAVE HAD OUR OWN SURVEYOR 
GIVE THE HOUSE A ONCE OVER ON YOUR BEHALF 
THAT'S WHERE I GET VERY FORMAL IT'S NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY AND WE'D ALWAYS IMPLORE YOU 
TO GET A FULL STRUCTURAL SURVEY CARRIED OUT IN THE VERY FIRST INSTANCE SO THERE YOU GO 
BUT HE HAS POINTED OUT ONE OR TWO VERY INTERESTING THINGS 
FIRSTLY THE ROOF JOISTS ARE ACTUALLY VERY WEAK 
AND IT'S NOTICEABLE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
YOU'LL SEE THE ROOF IS SAGGING 
IT WILL NEED STRENGTHENING UP 
IT WILL COST A FEW QUID 
BUT IT COULD BE TIED IN WITH THAT CONVERSION THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER 
IF IT'S NOT ABOUT TO FALL DOWN GET IT DONE AT THE SAME TIME NOT A BIG ISSUE 
THE OTHER THING YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT WAS MISSING 
IS THE AIR BRICKS AROUND THE PROPERTY 
THERE'S NOT ONE TO BE SEEN IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL IN ITSELF 
BECAUSE THEY'RE ONE A BRICK AND YOU NEED TO SPACE THEM OUT AT ABOUT ONE EVERY METRE 
OTHERWISE THOSE LOVELY WOODEN FLOORBOARDS MIGHT BEGIN TO ROT 
THERE YOU GO THAT'S IT YES TEST DRIVE BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE LET US OUT OF THESE 
IT'S ON THE DECISION STILL 
I'VE STILL GOT TO SAY BARTER OR SCARPER THEN I'LL LET YOU OUT 
WHAT A HARD WOMAN HOW DO YOU PUT UP WITH HER ENJOY YOURSELVES 
DOMINIC WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO 
GET A HACKSAW NOW LOCKSMITH 
DOM CONSIDERING THEY'RE SUCH HOARDERS

STREWTH THAT IS A JOHN SIZED DISH

I'VE ALSO BROUGHT A DIDGERIDOO JUST TO SEE IF IT FITS IN WITH THE DECOR 
OH MY GOSH 
YOU'VE GOT TO BRING ALL SORTS 
DON'T PUT IT NEAR JOHN HE'LL EAT IT 
IF THIS SOIL TESTING WORKS OUT 
AND THE GIANT BED FITS THE BEDROOM I'M ON THE ROAD TO FREEDOM 
IF THAT BED DOESN'T FIT I'M TAKING THE WALLS DOWN UNTIL IT DOES 
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY DOM EVERY INCH COUNTS IN THE BEDROOM 
HOW'RE YOU GETTING ON JOHN FIT IN NO PROBLEM 
JOHN I'M ABOUT THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD TO EVER ASK YOU 
HAVE YOU GOT A VELCRO HEADBOARD YOU'RE THINNING UP THERE HAIR TODAY GONE TOMORROW

AND DOMINIC CAN SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE 
NOW TALKING OF EXPERIENCE I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE
