STEERING THE REDS TOWARDS THE BARGAINS IS MICHAEL HOGBEN 
AND CHECKING UP ON THE BLUES IS THE DISCERNING PIPPA DEELEY 
HI 
GIRLS COME HITHER 
DON'T RACE OVER TOO QUICKLY LOOK AT THIS LITTLE GEM 
I'M ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH IT SO MUCH SO THAT I BOUGHT IT 
RACING PIGEON TIMER 
NOW RACING PIGEON EXPERTS ARE GONNA DIE FOR THIS SORT OF THING 
I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE HOW IT WORKS SO DON'T ASK ME 
I'M NOT A RACING PIGEON BUFF 
BUT IF YOU CAN HOLD THAT BOX WHILE I TRY AND GET IT OUT IT'S A BIT 
OUT SHE COMES LIKE THAT SO THIS WOULD LOCK OVER AND THEY'D 
PUT THE PIGEON LEG IN THE TOP THERE 
THEN THEY SET IT LIKE THAT WHICH TIMES IT 
THE PIGEON GOES OFF ON ITS ROUNDS COMES BACK PUT THE LEG IN THERE 
YOU'D HAVE LIKE A TACHO IN THERE 
LIKE A CAR AND THAT'S HOW THEY TIMED THE RACING PIGEONS 
AND I JUST THINK IT'S GOT SO MUCH POTENTIAL FOR A PROFIT 
COS YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SAID TO ME HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY HAVE I SPENT 
HOW MUCH OF OUR MONEY HAVE YOU SPENT 
TAKE A GUESS 
IT'S INTRICATE IT'S A CLOCK IT'S A SPECIALIST THING 
HOW OLD 
NINETEEN TWENTIES AND IT'S FRENCH ORIGIN 
SO WHAT D'YOU THINK 
SIXTY SEVENTY MAYBE 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA SAY TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED QUID THIRTY 
WOW 
IT'S A STEAL 
I HOPE YOU SNAPPED THEIR HAND OFF 
WELL I JUST COULDN'T RESIST IT 
SO THAT IS OUR FIRST PURCHASE IN THE BAG YOU LIKE IT 
WHAT ABOUT THE WEAR ON IT 
DOES THAT REFLECT ON THE PRICE 
WHEN YOU THINK IT'S NEARLY SEVENTY YEARS OLD 
THERE'S A FEW PIGEON LEGS BEEN IN THERE 
IT'S GOTTA BE A BARGAIN THOUGH 
WHAT DO YOU THINK PEG YEAH THAT IS A REALLY GOOD FIND 
THAT'S GONNA MAKE A FAIR FEW QUID BELIEVE YOU ME 
RIGHT MICHAEL WE'LL GO WITH YOU ON THAT 
LET'S GO AND FIND ANOTHER BARGAIN 
FOLLOW ME 
TRUST MICHAEL TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING QUIRKY 
THE BLUES HAVE FOUND SOMETHING TO MAKE THEIR EYES SPARKLE 
SO WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS BEV 
IT WAS IN THE STALL UP THERE AND IT WAS A NICE SORT OF PEACOCK BLUE 
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY COLOURS IT'S QUITE AN IRIDESCENT THING 
EXACTLY SO WHAT IS IT 
I THINK IT'S A LADY'S PIECE 
IT WOULD APPEAL TO ME 
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND THERE 
WE FOUND THIS ENAMEL BUCKLE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT REALLY LOVELY 
IT'S LOVELY COLOURS 
BUT IT DATES FROM AROUND NINETEEN HUNDRED NINETEEN OH FIVE 
THE ART NOUVEAU PERIOD WITH ALL THIS BEAUTIFUL SCROLLING FLOWERS 
AND THE COLOURING AS WELL IS VERY MUCH FROM THAT PERIOD 
THEY FOLLOWED ON FROM THE ARTS AND CRAFTS PEOPLE WHO 
WEREN'T AS INTERESTED IN THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THEIR MATERIALS 
THEY WERE MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON THE CRAFTSMANSHIP 
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO HAVE THESE IN SILVER 
I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY A SORT OF GILT BRASS MAYBE 
BUT THE VALUE REALLY LIES IN THE BEAUTIFUL ATTENTION TO DETAIL 
ON THE ENAMELLING AND WHAT YOU CALL GIOCHE UNDERNEATH 
WHERE THEY'VE GOT THIS ENGINE TURNING UNDERNEATH THE ENAMELLING 
THEY'VE ACTUALLY CUT INTO THE METAL SO YOU GET A SLIGHT TEXTURE TO IT 
IT'S VERY PRETTY 
I THINK YOU'VE FOUND A REAL CRACKER HERE 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO HAVE PAID FOR IT 
IF THIS CAME INTO THE AUCTION ROOM WHERE I WORK I'D EXPECT IT TO MAKE 
BETWEEN THE SIXTY TO EIGHTY MARK AND I THINK IT MIGHT EVEN MAKE SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THAT ON A GOOD DAY 
WELL THAT'S GOOD IT WAS SIXTY FIVE 
HAVE YOU ALREADY BOUGHT THIS 
ER YES FINE 
WE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS LOVELY 
WELL ON YOUR HEAD BE IT 
GOING OFF BUYING THINGS WITHOUT CONSULTING ME 
I'M NOT LETTING YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT FOR THE NEXT ONE 
A PRETTY OBJECT 
HOWEVER LET'S HOPE THE COLLECTORS ARE POISED 
OH WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH YOU 
NOT A LOT 
PUT YOUR DIDGERIDOO DOWN 
HE'S MESSING ABOUT WITH HIS DIDGERIDOO I DON'T KNOW 
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PERSUADE ME ON THIS ONE BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE IT 
I KNOW IT'S NOT NORMALLY THE COLOUR WE GO FOR BUT IT IS DAVIDSON GLASS 
IT IS IT'S CALLED CLOUD GLASS AND IN THE THIRTIES WHEN THIS WAS MADE 
IF YOU COULDN'T AFFORD YOUR TIFFANYS THIS WAS A GOOD SECOND BEST 
THEY DID IT IN BLUE GREEN BUT THE MOST POPULAR ONE WAS THE BROWN 
IT COMES INTO ITS OWN IF YOU'VE GOT A NICE TABLE LAMP ABOVE IT 
AND IT SHINES THROUGH IT 
IF YOU HOLD THAT UP TO THE LIGHT YOU CAN SEE LOVELY SWIRLS 
IT'S QUITE MODERN QUITE MINIMALIST AND YET IT DATES TO THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
I'VE SEEN THESE UP AT FIFTY QUID 
EVEN WITH CHIPS IN THEY'RE NOT CHIPS THEY'RE NICKS 
AND THERE'S ONE ON THE BASE AS WELL 
YEAH BUT LOOK AT THE PRICE OF IT EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE OH IT'S A STEAL 
I THINK WE CAN GET A BIT MORE KNOCKED OFF IT 
IF YOU CAN GET IT FOR FIFTEEN IS THAT A GOOD BUY 
IT'S WORTH THAT TO SMASH IT 
OH CAN I DO THAT THEN NO NO YOU BLOOMIN' WELL CAN'T 
ALL RIGHT THEN 
ALL RIGHT THEN 
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD BUY SHALL I GO AND HAVE A GO THEN 
DO YOUR STUFF GIRL 
I'M GOING 
IF IT'D HAVE BEEN GREEN I'D HAVE LOVED IT 
PEGGY BUYS THE BOWL FOR FIFTEEN 
THIS IS VERY RETRO ISN'T IT AL MARTINI AND LEMONADE 
OOH YEAH 
GIN AND TONIC 
NO NO NO NO NO 
HAVE YOU READ THE STIPULATIONS FROM THE AUCTION ROOM WE'RE GOING TO 
THIS CERTAINLY DOESN'T FIT THEM 
THIS HOWEVER MIGHT SNEAK IN IN THE ORIENTAL SECTION 
THEY'RE TWO LITTLE CLOISONNE POTS 
HAVE A FEEL SEE WHAT YOU THINK 
AGAIN DO YOU LIKE THE COLOUR 
I KNOW WITH THE BUCKLE YOU REALLY LIKED THE COLOUR 
IT IS A SIMILAR COLOURING THE BLUE AND THAT 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE LUSTRE THAT YOU GET WITH THAT SORT OF ENAMEL 
THIS IS MUCH DEEPER MORE MATT 
IT DOES HAVE LITTLE CHIPS IN IT DOES THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
THEY WILL EITHER BE BUBBLES THAT WERE DONE IN THE FIRING PROCESS OR THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN KNOCKED 
IF IT GOES DOWN TO THE BASE METAL 
WHICH ON THIS IS A SORT OF COPPER 
SO YOU'D START OFF WITH A COPPER POT AND THEN THEY GET TINY TINY 
FINE WIRE AND THEY PUT IT ONTO THE BASE AND SO YOU ACTUALLY MAKE UP 
LITTLE POCKETS THAT THEY COULD PUT THE CLOISONNE INTO AND IT WON'T RUN 
INTO OTHER COLOURS AND THEN IT'S FIRED 
AND THAT'S THE FINISHED PRODUCT 
I PERSONALLY DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THEM 
O. K. THEY'RE QUITE OLD 
I'D SAY THEY WERE PROBABLY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
THEY'RE NOT MY CUP OF TEA BUT ARE THEY SELLABLE 
WELL INITIALLY HE WAS ASKING SEVENTY FIVE BUT SIXTY IS THE PRICE THAT HE WILL 
COME DOWN TO CAN I PERSUADE YOU 
IF THEY'RE GONNA MAKE MONEY YEAH 
YOU DON'T LIKE THEM NO 
ON YOUR HEAD BE IT PIPPA 
RIGHT O. K. I WILL TAKE THE 
FULL FORCE OF YOUR DISAPPROVAL IF THEY DON'T DO AS I SAID THEY WOULD 
BUT I THINK THEY'LL MAKE YOU A PROFIT 
SO SHALL I GO AND DO THE DEED 
YEAH O. K. WE'LL MOVE ON SHALL WE 
ONE MORE TO FIND O. K. 
ON YOUR HEAD BE IT PIPPA 
OOH I DO LOVE THIS BARGAIN HUNTING LARK 
HERE WE ARE IN THE BOSOM OF WALES THE VERY HEARTLAND OF THE 
PRINCIPALITY AND WHAT HAVE I FOUND ON A LITTLE OUTSIDE STALL 
THAT THE STALLHOLDER CLEARLY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT 
SOMETHING THAT IS WELSH 
BUT SPECIAL WELSH LOOK AT THAT 
IT'S A HAT OR COAT ORNAMENT 
IT'S MADE OF SOLID SILVER IT'S EMBOSSED AND IT SAYS ICH DIEN 
IT'S THE PRINCE OF WALES' FEATHERS 
EXCEPT WHAT THE DEALER HASN'T TWIGGED IS THAT THIS PROBABLY DATES 
FROM THE PERIOD OF THE PRINCE OF WALES WHO BECAME GEORGE THE FOURTH 
THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT OF ALL THE PRINCES OF WALES AND ONLY HE 
WOULD HAVE HAD ORNAMENTS MADE LIKE THIS FOR HIS SERVANTS TO WEAR 
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A HEADPIECE ATTACHED TO A GREAT BIG VELVET CAP 
THAT PERHAPS ONE OF THE KING'S COURTIERS WOULD HAVE 
WORN IN A PROCESSION GOING INTO THE HOUSE OF LORDS PERHAPS BEFORE HIM 
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE THRILL OF FINDING NOT ONE THESE JOKERS 
BUT TWO EXTRAORDINARY ISN'T IT 
WHAT ARE THEY WORTH WELL IN THE RIGHT SALE 
THEY'RE PROBABLY WORTH BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED 
AND WHAT DID I FIND THEM FOR FIFTEEN 
YAKKY D. A.

DOULTON MADE A LOT OF THINGS 
FIGURINES DINNER SERVICES CUPS SAUCERS YOU NAME IT THEY MADE IT

BY CHARLIE NOKE AND HE DID VASES ANIMALS 
THIS PARTICULAR PATTERN IS CALLED WOODCUT 
AND IT'S A REALLY NICE SIZE A REALLY NICE DESIGN 
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG 
WHAT ATTRACTED YOU TO IT 
THE COLOUR OF THE GLAZE 
THE SCENE THAT'S ON IT REMINDS ME OF WHERE WE LIVE 
NEAR ONE OF THE BIGGEST DEER PARKS IN THE COUNTRY 
HAVE YOU CHECKED IT FOR DAMAGE 
THERE'S NO DAMAGE ON THE BASE OR THE LIP BUT THE GLAZING HAS GOT SLIGHT 
SCRATCH MARKS 
THAT'S LIKE LADIES WITH DIAMOND RINGS SCRATCHING IT 
HAVE YOU GOT ANY RINGS YEAH SEE SHE'S ALREADY DAMAGED IT 
THERE ARE A FEW NICKS THERE BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA MATTER PEGGY 
I REALLY LIKE IT I LOVE THE COLOUR AND IT JUST FEELS REALLY NICE 
YOU'VE MADE A GOOD CHOICE THERE 
IT FEELS RIGHT AND IT LOOKS RIGHT 
I LIKE IT 
THAT'S GREAT 
IT DEPENDS ON THE PRICE HOW MUCH IS IT

IT'S QUITE STRONG BUT IT'S IN WITH A CHANCE AT THAT PRICE 
WE WANT IT LESS THAN A HUNDRED NINETY NINETY FIVE 
OH YEAH FANTASTIC

WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT IN THERE ANY LITTLE GEMS 
I DON'T THINK WE'RE THAT LUCKY 
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT ANYTHING

WHO COLLECT SEWING ITEMS OR BOXES

YOU'VE GOT US ALL INTRIGUED HAVEN'T YOU 
VERY GOOD LUCK AND I'M OFF TO THE COUNTRY 
WE'RE JUST DOWN THE ROAD AT CHIRK OUTSIDE THE SERVANTS' DOORWAY IN THE INNER COURTYARD 
FANCY A BEER 
NO WELL IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IF YOU DIDN'T DRINK BEER HERE AT CHIRK 
YOU'D HAVE GONE MIGHTY THIRSTY 
THE WATER WAS DODGY AND THE ONLY RELIABLE THING WAS TO DRINK BEER 
WHICH THEY DID AT BREAKFAST LUNCH AND TEA 
THIS IS WHAT THEY SERVED IT IN 
IT'S A WHEELED CONTRIVANCE CALLED A 
BEER WAGON THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PUSHED FROM ONE 
END OF THE LONG REFECTORY TABLE STARTING WITH THE CHIEF STEWARD 
NEAR THE FIRE ALL THE WAY DOWN THE REFECTORY TABLE 
TO THE POOREST PEASANTS AND CHILDREN DOWN AT THE FAR SIDE 
AND THEY'D HAVE USED A LEATHER TANKARD LIKE THIS AND SIMPLY 
DIPPED IT IN AND TAKEN THEIR SUP 
THE MASTERS GOT THE STRONG STUFF 
THE SECOND BREW WAS DRUNK BY THE MEN SERVANTS AND THE WEAKEST 
WHICH WAS CALLED SMALL BEER WAS SERVED TO THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
HOW MUCH WORK DID THEY GET DONE 
AND JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL 
THE SERVANTS KEPT A PROPER TRACK OF TIME TYPICALLY IN A SERVANTS' HALL 
YOU'D HAVE A SINGLE TIMEPIECE LIKE THIS 
CRUDELY MADE OF A SERIES OF PINE PLANKS NAILED TOGETHER TO MAKE 
THE DIAL AND IT CONTAINED A TIMEPIECE MOVEMENT 
NOTHING SOPHISTICATED OR CHIMING 
THEY SIMPLY NEEDED TO KNOW WHAT THE HOURS WERE 
AND RUNNING DOWN THE TRUNK HERE YOU'D SIMPLY CONTAIN THE PENDULUM 
THIS ONE WAS MADE IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY THREE AND IT'S OF A TYPE THAT VERY MUCH RESEMBLES 
AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT CLOCK 
THEY WERE INTRODUCED IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN 
FOLLOWING THE TAX ON CLOCKS AND TIMEPIECES 
THAT TAX WAS ENORMOUS 
TO OWN A GOLD WATCH LIKE THIS WOULD HAVE COST ME TEN BOB A YEAR 
THAT'S ABOUT FORTY A YEAR SIMPLY FOR OWNING A GOLD WATCH 
EVERYBODY GAVE THOSE UP VERY SMARTLY 
AND RELIED ON ONE SINGLE PUBLIC TIMEPIECE LIKE THIS 
NATURALLY ALL THE CLOCK AND WATCHMAKERS WERE UP IN ARMS 
THEY LOBBIED PARLIAMENT AND THE NEXT YEAR 
WILLIAM PITT ABOLISHED THE TAX 
WHICH MEANS I CAN TAKE MY WATCH OUT OH MY LORD IS IT THAT TIME ALREADY 
WE'D BETTER SHOVE OFF TO THE AUCTION 
I'M GOING TO HASTEN DOWN MEMORY LANE TO HALLS AUCTIONEERS IN BEAUTIFUL SHREWSBURY 
IT'S REALLY SMASHING TO BE HERE 
AT HALLS SALEROOM IN SHREWSBURY WITH JEREMY LAMOND 
NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE 
IT'S MARVELLOUS THE OLD STAMPING GROUND 
FIRST UP FOR PEGGY AND RACHEL IS THE RACING CLOCK 
THAT'S TOULET FIRST DESIGNED IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND IS STILL BEING USED BY THE ROYAL PIGEON ASSOCIATION 
ALL OF THESE OLD MACHINES WERE CERTIFICATED LAST YEAR 
TO BE USED AGAINST DIGITAL CLOCKS 
A VERY GOOD MACHINE BUT NOT RARE I THINK THIRTY TO FORTY 
BUT THERE'S LOTS OF PIGEON FANCIERS OUT THERE SO YOU NEVER KNOW 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT THIRTY THEY PAID 
WHAT ABOUT THIS RATHER DULL GLASS BOWL 
THIS IS A DAVIDSON NINETEEN THIRTIES GATESHEAD BOWL 
CLOUD GLASS AS IT WAS KNOWN OR AMBER GLASS HERE 
NOT RARE MADE IN A MOULD 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY 
GREAT THEY ONLY PAID FIFTEEN 
YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT 
IT IS DULL THOUGH 
TALKING ABOUT DULL WHAT ABOUT THIS DOULTON FLAMBE JOBBY 
LOTS OF COLLECTORS FOR DOULTON FLAMBE 
IT IS A WOOD CUT VASE A TYPICAL ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTEEN PATTERNED ONE 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT SIXTY TO EIGHTY A TYPICAL PRICE FOR ONE OF THOSE 
DOULTON HAS PLATEAUED A LITTLE BIT LATELY BUT WE'LL SEE 
IT NEEDS TO BREAK THROUGH THE SIXTY TO EIGHTY ESTIMATE BECAUSE THEY PAID NINETY FIVE 
O. K. WELL WE'RE ON THE NET SO IT COULD GO TO THE AMERICANS 
THERE WE GO HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL 
THEY COULD PUT ALL THEIR HOPE AND TRUST 
IN THE EXPERT'S BONUS BUY WHICH WE'RE GOING TO HAVING A LOOK AT NOW 
RACH PEGS THIS IS THE MOMENT O. K. FOR THE BONUS BUY 
YOU GAVE MICHAEL ONE HUNDRED SIXTY WHAT DID HE DO WITH THEM 
IT'S NICE TO HAVE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SO I WENT QUALITY TIM 
THIS IS A LOVELY PIECE I BOUGHT IT OFF A SPECIALIST 
IT'S SWANSEA ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
BECAUSE IT'S UNMARKED AND SOME SWANSEA WAS UNMARKED 
THE AUCTIONEER MIGHT ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION AND SAY SWANSEA STYLE 
IT COULD KILL IT OR IT COULD FLY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I WOULDN'T KNOW BECAUSE I'M NOT A SWANSEA MAN 
IF YOU PUT THE SWANSEA BUTTON ON IT IT'S WORTH WHAT THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR IT 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
DON'T GO DROPPING IT NOW RACH 
YOU SEE THIS LOVELY DECORATION AND ALL THESE ENAMELS 
IT'S A PATTERN CALLED TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE NOW 
YOU CAN DECIDE AFTER THE SALE OF YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS 
BUT RIGHT NOW YOU AT HOME CAN FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS 
SO HERE IS THE PLATE DO YOU RATE THAT JEREMY 
I DO IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT 
SHOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN IT GENERALLY IS THESE DAYS 
THIS IS ALL HAND PAINTED STUFF 
IT'S REGENCY PORCELAIN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY 
JUST THINK HOW MANY ENAMEL FIRINGS IT TOOK TO MAKE THIS 
IT'S A BIT OF A SWANSEA STYLE THIS 
PATTERN TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN EUROPEAN FLOWERS 
WHETHER IT IS SWANSEA IS DIFFICULT TO TELL 
I RATE THIS AT ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
MICHAEL PAID ONE HUNDRED FORTY THAT'S O. K. 
IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH AND IT'S AN INTERESTING ITEM 
AND FOR A CHANGE IT'S NOT CRACKED OR BROKEN 
IS THERE ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH BEV AND ALI'S BELT BUCKLE 
IT'S QUITE STYLISH ISN'T IT 
IT'S NOT MY FORTE JEWELLERY 
IT'S AN ENAMEL PROBABLY FRENCH 
I WOULD RATE THIS AT EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY A BUTTERFLY PATTERN 
THEY WILL BE OVER THE MOON 
THAT'S WIZARD THEY PAID SIXTY FIVE 
GOSH THAT'S GOOD 
OR DO I MEAN BAD 
GOOD FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW 
YOU MEAN WICKED 
NOW WHAT ABOUT THESE CLOISONNE SQUAT LITTLE FELLOWS 
I THINK YOU SAID IT ALL THERE WHAT ABOUT THEM THESE ARE NOT RARE 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIRTY TO FORTY I THINK THIS WAS A FRIDAY AFTERNOON BUY 
REALLY 
NOT RARE A LITTLE BIT CHIPPED THE CLOISONNE IS DAMAGED 
FANTASTICALLY DIFFICULT TO RESTORE 
IS IT WORTH RESTORING ABSOLUTELY NOT 
IT'S NOT WORTHWHILE TAKING 
IT OUT OF THE BACK OF THE CAR ANYWAY THIRTY TO FIFTY IS YOUR ESTIMATE 
SIXTY THEY PAID SO THAT COULD BE A DISASTER 
THAT COULD GOBBLE UP ALL THE PROFIT ON THAT BUCKLE 
ON THE OTHER HAND THEY'VE GOT THIS LOVELY WELL STRUNG BOX HERE 
THIS IS OAK BRASS STRUNG OAK LADY'S WORKBOX 
A LITTLE PULL OUT TRAY AND LOOK AT THIS 
THERE'S EVERYTHING IN HERE

IT IS ALL QUITE FETCHING 
ALL THESE BITS LOOK 
YOU'VE GOT SOME GUSSET HERE GUSSET ELASTIC 
THIS ALL COMES WITH THE LOT 
THIS IS GOOD NEWS 
I THINK THE BOX IS WORTH SIXTY TO EIGHTY 
IT COULD MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE 
THEY PAID EIGHTY THAT'S ALL RIGHT 
IT'S ALL WITHIN A WHISKER HOW EXCITING 
TO MAKE ALL THOSE DISCOVERIES IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BOX 
I'M UNDERWHELMED I MEAN OVERWHELMED

THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY 
THE THING IS MADE OF HEAVY HARDWOOD 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO PICK UP MUCH HEAVIER THAN IT LOOKS 
AND THIS INLAY IS OF AN EXQUISITE TYPE 
EACH PIECE AS YOU CAN SEE HAS GOT LITTLE BLACK LINES IN IT 
EACH OF THOSE LINES WERE MADE BY A RED HOT NEEDLE 
WHICH SCRATCHED THE SURFACE 
AND WAS THEN FILLED WITH BLACK MUCK TO GIVE IT A DEGREE OF CONTRAST 
YOU'VE GOT THIS MARVELLOUS CENTRAL 
PEDESTAL WITH A GREAT SPROUTING GROUP OF FLOWERS EMANATING FROM THE 
TOP AND A VERY DEEP BAND OF DENSE FOLIAGE RUNNING AROUND THE BORDER 
IF I OPEN UP THE TOP YOU CAN SEE INSIDE THAT IT DID AT ONE TIME HAVE 
SOME SUB DIVISIONS PROBABLY TO HOLD SILVER OR GOLD CONTAINERS 
AND UNDERNEATH IT'S GOT A LITTLE DRAWER 
AND THAT TOO IS ENTIRELY MADE OF HARDWOOD 
INSIDE THE THING INTERESTINGLY IS A LITTLE OLD BAG OF BITS 
I'VE FOUND THAT PIECE THAT'S THE KEY ESCUTCHEON 
WHICH FITS EXACTLY THAT VACANT OVAL JUST IN FRONT OF THE LOCK 
ISN'T THAT A LOVELY THING 
IT WANTS A BIT OF RESTORATION 
THAT'S NOTHING IN RELATION TO THE STORY THAT THIS THING COULD TELL 
WHAT'S IT WORTH WELL THE ESTIMATE IS TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED 
AND I FANCY IT'S WORTH A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN THAT
