WERE YOU HOT IN THE SUN 
I WAS I'M GLAD I'VE GOT MY HANDKERCHIEF 
BECAUSE I CAN USE IT TO WIPE MY BROW 
OH 
THAT MEANS THAT IT'S TIME FOR OUR STORY 
IN TODAY'S STORY THERE'S A TEDDY BEAR 
WHO USES HIS HANDKERCHIEF IN LOTS OF VERY DIFFERENT WAYS 
TIKKABILLA TOCKABILLA TIKKABILLA TOCK 
WHAT'S THE TIME ON THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
AH HA 
THE BIG HAND IS POINTING TO THE NUMBER THREE 
AND THAT MEANS THAT IT IS A QUARTER PAST SOMETHING 
AND THE LITTLE HAND HAS JUST PASSED THE NUMBER FIVE 
SO IT'S A QUARTER PAST FIVE 
AND WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
IT'S A SANDCASTLE 
TODAY'S STORY IS CALLED LOST ON THE BEACH 
IT WAS A HOT AFTERNOON ON THE BEACH 
LILY WAS BUSY PLAYING IN THE SAND 
TEDDY WAS JUST SITTING 
I LIKE YOUR SANDCASTLE SAID MUM WHEN LILY HAD FINISHED DIGGING 
IT'S A HOUSE FOR TEDDY SAID LILY 
MUM LAID OUT A TOWEL AND SET TEDDY DOWN 
COME ON SHE SAID LET'S LEAVE TEDDY HERE 
WHILE WE GO FOR AN ICE CREAM 
WAIT SAID LILY AND SHE TIED A HANDKERCHIEF AROUND TEDDY'S HEAD 
THAT'LL KEEP YOU COOL WHILE I'M GONE SHE SAID 
TEDDY SAT QUIETLY IN THE HOT SUN 
BUT THEN WOOPS 
HE FELL BACKWARDS AS SOMETHING TUGGED AT HIS TOWEL 
A SMALL PUPPY HAD A CORNER OF TEDDY'S TOWEL IN HIS TEETH 
AS THE PLAYFUL PUP BEGAN TO PULL 
TEDDY BUMP BUMP BUMPED ACROSS THE BEACH 
WHEN THE PUPPY LET GO 
TEDDY WAS OVER BY THE ROCKS 
AND A LONG LONG WAY FROM HIS SANDCASTLE HOME 
FOR A WHILE HE CLAMBERED HAPPILY ABOUT 
IN BETWEEN THE ROCKS WERE POOLS OF SEA WATER 
WITH ALL KINDS OF CREATURES IN THEM 
HE HAD FUN SPLASHING HIS PAWS IN THE WATER 
UNTIL OUCH HE WAS PINCHED BY A CRAB 
THEN HE SAT DOWN FOR A REST 
AND SUDDENLY HE FELT HIS BOTTOM GETTING WET 
OH DEAR THE TIDE WAS COMING IN 
HE COULD SEE THE SANDCASTLE HOUSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BEACH 
BUT HOW COULD HE GET BACK ACROSS THE WATER 
HE WAS TRAPPED 
TEDDY SPOTTED SOME SEAGULLS FLYING OVERHEAD 
QUICKLY HE TOOK OFF HIS HANDKERCHIEF YOO HOO HE WAVED 
A FRIENDLY GULL FLEW DOWN 
AND PICKED HIM UP 
WHEEEEE TEDDY WAS LIFTED HIGH INTO THE SKY 
WOOSH HE WAS FLYING THROUGH WHITE FLUFFY CLOUDS 
THEN WOOPS 
TEDDY LET GO AND HE WAS FALLING DOWN DOWN DOWN 
UNTIL HE GRABBED THE CORNERS OF HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO MAKE A PARACHUTE 
SLOWLY HE DRIFTED DOWN AND LANDED ON A PIECE OF WOOD 
FLOATING ON THE WAVES 
PHEW 
TEDDY BOBBED UP AND DOWN IN THE WATER FOR A WHILE 
SOON HE BEGAN TO FEEL COLD 
THE BEACH SEEMED A LONG WAY AWAY NOW 
I MUST GET BACK TO LILY HE SAID 
HE COULD JUST SEE THE LITTLE RED FLAG ON THE SANDCASTLE HOUSE 
AND HE BEGAN TO PADDLE TOWARDS IT 
SUDDENLY HE HEARD A ROARING SOUND 
A HUGE WAVE WAS COMING UP BEHIND HIM 
THE WAVE LIFTED HIM RIGHT OUT OF THE WATER 
HIGHER HIGHER AND HIGHER STILL 
UNTIL 
WHEEEEE 
HE WAS SURFING 
HA HA WHAT FUN 
WITH A CRASH THE WAVE DUMPED TEDDY ONTO THE SAND 
HE WAS BACK ON THE BEACH WHERE HE'D STARTED 
IT WAS HARD WORK CROSSING THE BEACH 
BECAUSE HIS PAWS KEPT SINKING IN THE SOFT SAND 
AT LAST HE WAS BACK AT HIS SANDCASTLE HOME 
HE PUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF ON HIS HEAD SAT DOWN 
AND WAITED 
WHEN LILY CAME BACK SHE GAVE HIM A CUDDLE 
OH TEDDY SHE SAID WHY ARE YOU ALL WET 
YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH LUCK DO YOU 
GOODNIGHT LILY KISS KISS AND GOODNIGHT TEDDY SLEEP TIGHT 
BUT WE KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED DON'T WE 
THAT HANDKERCHIEF WAS REALLY USEFUL WASN'T IT 
IT GOT TEDDY OUT OF A LOT OF TROUBLE 
CAN YOU THINK OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO USE YOUR HANDKERCHIEF 
AH THERE ARE SOME HANDKERCHIEFS THROUGH ONE OF THE WINDOWS TODAY 
SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT THEM 
HOW MANY WINDOWS

A BIG WOBBLY BODY D. A. RA OH THAT'S WONDERFUL 
GREAT I LIKE THIS GAME 
OH I THINK SAMMY'S DOING SOME DRAWING TODAY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
THIS IS SAMI HE LIVES WITH HIS MUM AND DAD 
HIS SISTER ANUJA AND HIS GRANDDAD SOLLY 
SAMI IS FOUR AND A HALF YEARS OLD 
AND SAMI LOVES TO DAYDREAM 
IT WAS SATURDAY AND IT WAS RAINING 
SAMI WAS IN HIS ROOM DRAWING 
HE WAS DRAWING A PICTURE OF A BOAT 
THAT WAS BEING TOSSED ABOUT ON A STORMY SEA 
THE WAVES WERE HIGH AND CRASHED DOWN OVER THE DECK 
AND THE SKIES WERE WILD AND DARK 
SAMI IMAGINED HIS BOAT REELING BACK AND FORTH IN THE WIND 
AND HE BEGAN TO FEEL QUITE SICK AS HE FELT THAT HE WAS MOVING TOO 
HE GOT UP FROM HIS TABLE AND STAGGERED ACROSS THE ROOM 
BUT IT WAS SWAYING FROM SIDE TO SIDE WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO WALK 
WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR 
HE WAS INSTANTLY SOAKED AS A WAVE CRASHED OVER HIM 
AND HE FOUND THAT HE WAS STANDING ON THE DECK OF A BOAT 
HOLD ON TIGHT SHOUTED A SAILOR AS HE RAN PAST A LOOKOUT POST 
AND ANOTHER WAVE BROKE OVER THEM 
GET BELOW DECKS SHOUTED SOMEONE ELSE 
WHO WAS BUSY FASTENING DOWN ONE OF THE SAILS 
SAMI WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL VERY SEASICK INDEED NOW 
AND DESPERATELY WANTED THE BOAT TO STOP MOVING UP AND DOWN 
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING I CAN DO HE THOUGHT 
THIS IS MY PICTURE AFTER ALL 
THEN HE HAD AN IDEA 
HE WAS STILL CLUTCHING HIS CRAYONS 
AND AMONGST THEM WAS A BRIGHT YELLOW ONE 
HOLDING ONTO THE RAILS AS TIGHTLY AS HE COULD 
SAMI BATTLED HIS WAY TO THE FRONT OF THE BOAT 
A ROPE LADDER HUNG FROM THE TOP OF THE MAST 
AS CAREFULLY AS HE COULD HE BEGAN TO CLIMB IT 
AT THE TOP OF THE MAST HE REACHED OUT AND DREW 
A ROUND YELLOW SUN IN THE SKY 
IT WAS A BIT SHAKY AS THE BOAT WAS MOVING SO MUCH 
BUT IT DID THE TRICK 
ALMOST AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED DRAWING THE WIND DROPPED 
THE WAVES CALMED AND THE BOAT STOPPED ROCKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE 
PHEW SAID SAMI AND DREW A FLAG WITH A RAINBOW ON IT 
TO FLY FROM THE TOP OF THE MAST 
THEN CLIMBED BACK DOWN TO THE DECK WHERE THE CREW WERE WAITING FOR HIM 
THREE CHEERS FOR SAMI CALLED THE CAPTAIN 
AND THE SAILORS SHOUTED HIP HIP HOORAY AS HE CLAMBERED DOWN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAID THE CAPTAIN 
THAT WAS A VERY BRAVE THING YOU DID 
AND SAMI FELT SUDDENLY RATHER SHY 
THE CAPTAIN WAS ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE 
BUT HIS VOICE WAS DROWNED OUT BY A LOUD RUMBLE 
THE SAILORS LOOKED UP BUT THE SKIES WERE CLEAR 
IT COULDN'T BE ANOTHER STORM 
THEN THE RUMBLE CAME AGAIN AND SAMI REALISED 
THAT IT WAS COMING FROM HIS STOMACH 
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR TEA HE SAID 
AND EVERYONE AGREED 
THERE WAS A PROBLEM 
ALL THE BOAT'S SUPPLIES HAD BEEN WASHED OVERBOARD 
AND THERE WAS NO FOOD LEFT TO EAT 
DON'T WORRY SAID SAMI AND TOOK OUT HIS CRAYONS 
AND BEGAN DRAWING 
FIRST HE DREW SOME SANDWICHES 
THEN CAKES AND HMM BISCUITS 
AND ICE CREAMS AND LAST OF ALL SOME GLASSES OF LEMONADE 
THEY TUCKED IN AND ATE AS MUCH AS THEY COULD 
UNTIL IT WAS TIME FOR SAMI TO GO 
HE SAID GOODBYE TO THE SAILORS AND OPENED THE DOOR BACK TO HIS BEDROOM 
THE FLOOR WAS QUITE STILL NOW AND HE LOOKED AT HIS PICTURE ON THE TABLE 
WHERE THE BOAT WAS SAILING PEACEFULLY UNDER A CLEAR BLUE SKY 
THE RAINBOW FLAG WAS FLYING FROM THE TOP OF THE MAST 
AND WHEN HE LOOKED CLOSELY 
HE COULD JUST MAKE OUT THE CAPTAIN WAVING TO HIM 
AS THE BOAT SAILED OFF TO THE HORIZON 
I THINK SAMI AND THE SAILORS PREFERRED WHEN THE SEA WAS CALM 
DON'T YOU YES THE SEA WAS VERY STORMY 
I'VE GOT FIVE LITTLE BOATS HERE ON A VERY CALM SEA 
DO YOU KNOW WHY WHY 
THE FIVE LITTLE BOAT RHYME WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO IT WITH ME YES 
YOU CAN JOIN IN TOO IF YOU LIKE READY 
YEAH 
FIVE LITTLE BOATS SAILING ON THE SEA 
I WAVED TO THE CAPTAINS THE CAPTAINS WAVED TO ME 
FIVE LITTLE BOATS SAILING TO THE SHORE 
ONE PUT DOWN AN ANCHOR AND THEN THERE WERE FOUR 
FOUR LITTLE BOATS SAILING ON THE SEA 
ONE SPRUNG A LEAK HAAA AND THEN THERE WERE THREE 
THREE LITTLE BOATS SAILING WITH FULL CREW 
ONE PUT UP ANOTHER SAIL AND THEN THERE WERE TWO 
TWO LITTLE BOATS SAILING IN THE SUN 
ONE WENT TO THE HARBOUR OOOOOH AND THEN THERE WAS ONE 
ONE LITTLE BOAT SAILING HAVING FUN 
HE SAILED HE SAILED ACROSS THE SEA 
AND NOW THERE ARE NONE 
THERE ARE NO BOATS LEFT BEVERLY 
OH YES THERE ARE 
LOOK WHAT I'VE GOT 
HA HA AND THE LAST ONE MAKES FIVE 
DO YOU LIKE OUR BOATS PAUL YES THEY'RE GREAT 
THOSE BOATS HAVE GIVEN ME AN IDEA 
I'M GOING TO MAKE MY OWN BOAT 
I'VE ALREADY MADE ONE OVER HERE 
NOW I REALLY LIKE MARGARINE ON MY SANDWICHES 
I'VE EATEN SO MANY THAT THIS TUB IS NOW EMPTY 
IT'S PERFECT FOR THE MAIN PART OF OUR BOAT 
I'VE ALSO GOT SOME LOVELY SILVER FOIL 
WHAT A LOVELY SOUND A BIT LIKE RAIN 
I'VE JUST TORN A HUGE PIECE OFF 
AND I'M POPPING MY MARGARINE TUB INTO THE MIDDLE 
THEN I'M GOING TO WRAP IT ALL UP IN THIS SILVER FOIL 
CRUMPLING IT IN CRUMPLE 
OH IT'S GREAT FUN 
HA HA HA 
YOU CAN SQUASH IT ALL AROUND LIKE THAT 
AND WE'VE GOT A NICE SHINY SILVER BOAT 
THERE WE ARE NOW 
MY BOAT NEEDS A MAST AND A SAIL 
THE MAST IS THE THING THAT THE SAIL SITS ON 
A MAST IS USUALLY MADE OUT OF WOOD BUT I'M USING A STRAW 
BUT I DON'T NEED THIS BENDY BIT 
I'LL NEED TO CUT THAT BIT OFF THERE YOU GO 
AND I NEED TO USE THIS 
MODELLING CLAY WHICH IS NICE AND SOFT AND SQUIDGY 
AND I'M GOING TO PUT THAT INTO THE MIDDLE OF MY BOAT 
LIKE THIS AND I'M GOING TO PUT MY STRAW MAST INSIDE 
JUST LIKE THAT 
STICKS PERFECTLY 
NOW MY SAIL 
I WONDER HOW I'M GOING TO MAKE A SAIL 
I'VE GOT SOME NICE BRIGHT ORANGE PAPER 
I'M GOING TO FOLD THIS PAPER 
FROM CORNER TO CORNER 
IT'S A SQUARE WHEN YOU FOLD A SQUARE FROM CORNER TO CORNER 
IT BECOMES A TRIANGLE 
THEN I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS A SMALLER TRIANGLE BY FOLDING AGAIN 
THAT'S A SMALLER TRIANGLE 
THEN I'M GOING TO OPEN IT BACK OUT A LITTLE BIT 
AND THERE WE'VE GOT A NICE SAIL SHAPE 
I'M GONNA STICK THAT TO THE MAST 
JUST POP THAT THERE FOR A MO 
I'VE GOT SOME STICKY TAPE HERE 
I'LL JUST STICK MY BRIGHT ORANGE SAIL TO MY MAST 
WITH SOME STICKY TAPE THERE WE ARE THAT SHOULD BE GOOD AND FIRM 
H. M. M. WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED 
I THINK IT WOULD BE QUITE NICE TO HAVE A LITTLE RED FLAG AT THE TOP 
I'VE GOT SOME BRIGHT RED IT'S ALMOST THE SAME COLOUR 
AS THE TIKKABILLA DOOR 
I'M JUST GOING TO CUT A TRIANGLE FROM THE CORNER LIKE THIS 
POP 
AND I'M JUST GOING TO POP THAT AT THE TOP OF MY SAIL 
SO SOME MORE STICKY TAPE 
AND I'LL JUST POP IT AT THE TOP LIKE THIS 
OH THIS IS QUITE TRICKY BECAUSE IT'S SO SMALL 
THERE WE ARE 
AND THAT'S OUR FLAG AT THE TOP YOU CAN MAKE A MUCH BIGGER FLAG 
I'M ALMOST FINISHED BUT IT DOES NEED SOME OARS 
OARS ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE USE WHEN THE SAIL DOESN'T WORK 
WHEN THERE'S NO WIND 
I'VE GOT TWO LOLLIPOP STICKS HERE 
I'VE GOT A YELLOW ONE AND A BLUE ONE 
AND THERE WE ARE 
MY BOAT IS NOW READY TO SAIL 
SO LET'S SEE IF IT CAN 
HEY HEY OH I LOVE YOUR BOAT PAUL 
SHALL WE SAIL IT YES OF COURSE 
SAILING ON MY BOAT
