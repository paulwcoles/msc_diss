THIS IS THE MAGNIFICENT COAL EXCHANGE IN CARDIFF 
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING IT USED TO BE THE CITY'S COMMERCIAL HUB BUT NOW IT'S A TOP ENTERTAINMENT VENUE 
HOSTING BIG NAME ACTS SUCH AS JOOLS HOLLAND VAN MORRISON AND FLOG IT 
CARDIFF WAS ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST COAL EXPORTERS 
AND BUILT ITS REPUTATION ON THIS BLACK GOLD 
THIS IS WHERE ALL THE BIG DEALS TOOK PLACE IN THE CITY'S INDUSTRIAL HEYDAY JUDGING BY THIS QUEUE 
WE'VE GONE BACK IN TIME COS ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE HERE TO MAKE A BOB OR TWO BY FLOGGING ANTIQUES 
THE TWO EXPERTS MAKING BIG DEALS TODAY ARE PHILLIP SERRELL AND JAMES LEWIS 
WHAT IS THAT WORTH ON THE OPEN MARKET 
THAT'S A TIDY LUMP GOOD CALL 
EIGHTY ONE POINT TWO OH THAT'S A CLICHE 
LET'S GET INSIDE AND HOPEFULLY DIG UP MORE TREASURES 
HOW YOU DOING TED VERY WELL I CAN SEE FROM THIS 
YOU'RE A LIFEBOAT HONORARY SECRETARY AND AN RNLI MAN 
I WAS UNTIL TWO YEARS AGO 
WHERE DID YOU SERVE BARRY DOCK 
OH DEAR WELL ALL CREDIT TO YOU TED IT WOULD TERRIFY ME 
YOU KNOW A BIT ABOUT THIS DON'T YOU DID YOU BUY IT OR DID YOU 
FOUND IT IN THE SKIP YOU FOUND IT IN A SKIP 
I WAS HELPING TO CLEAR SOMEONE'S HOUSE YEARS AGO 
IT WAS THROWN IN THE SKIP AND I LIKED IT 
I SAID CAN I HAVE IT HE SAID YES YOU CAN 
THAT WAS ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO 
WHAT APPEALED TO YOU ABOUT IT THE WORKMANSHIP IN IT 
WHY DO YOU NOW WANT TO SELL IT 
IT'S OF NO INTEREST TO MY DAUGHTER OR GRANDDAUGHTER 
I THOUGHT IF I CAN GET A FEW BOB FOR IT I'LL START MY OWN COLLECTION 
OF SMALL SILVER YOU'RE GOING TO SELL THIS AND BUY BITS OF SILVER BRILLIANT 
YOU'VE DONE SOME HOMEWORK INTO WHAT IT IS 
SO YOU CAN TELL ME AND I CAN BE COMPLETELY SUPERFLUOUS TO THIS 
TELL ME WHAT YOU FOUND OUT SOMEONE WENT ON THE INTERNET FOR ME 
AND FOUND OUT IS WAS A STEVENGRAPH 
CAN I JUST STOP YOU YEAH WHAT'S A STEVENGRAPH 
IT'S A PROCESS OF WEAVING SILK ON A JACQUARD LOOM 
WHEN DID THEY START DOING THAT THEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR IT SAYS ON THERE 
AND I THINK IT WAS FIVE OR SIX YEARS BEFORE THAT SO A STEVENGRAPH IS A PROCESS OF WEAVING SILK 
ON A LOOM THAT WAS IN YOUR VIEW INVENTED ROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY SOMETHING 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT'S BY THOMAS STEVENS 
IT SAYS SO ON THE BACK SHOW ME 
THOMAS STEVENS AND COVENTRY ON IT 
YOU SEE A LOT OF STEVENGRAPHS A LOT OF THEM ARE HUNTING SCENES 
AND A LOT OF JOCKEYS AND PORTRAITS OF FRED ARCHER AND THAT TYPE OF THING BUT THIS IS A REALLY LOVELY 
COMMEMORATIVE BOOKMARK BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING IS IT'S A CONUNDRUM 
I LOOKED UP STEVENS IN THE BOOK JUST BEFORE I STARTED FILMING THIS AND IT SAID HE INVENTED THIS PROCESS 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY TWO NOW YOU'VE GOT INFORMATION THAT SAYS IT WAS MORE LIKE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY SO WE'VE A CONUNDRUM HERE 
COS WITH A TWELVE YEAR GAP 
I WONDER WHETHER THESE THINGS WERE MASS PRODUCED AFTER THE ORIGINAL OPENING OF CRYSTAL PALACE 
SOLD SIMPLY AS COMMEMORATIVE ITEMS 
YOU SPENT A LOT OF MONEY FRAMING IT UP HAVEN'T YOU ABOUT FORTY FIFTY QUID 
THEY DID A GOOD JOB THEY'VE DONE A SUPER JOB OF IT 
MY VIEW ON AN ESTIMATE FOR THIS IS GONNA BE THE COST OF YOUR FRAMING 
I WOULD PUT AN ESTIMATE ON IT OF FORTY TO SIXTY 
WE'LL PUT A FIXED RESERVE ON IT AS WELL WE'LL PUT A RESERVE OF FORTY FOR YOU 
FAIR ENOUGH SO YOU'LL BUY A BIT OF SILVER WITH THE PROCEEDS 
I LIKE THE SMALL PIECES SCENT BOTTLES SNUFF BOXES 
THINGS LIKE THAT LET'S HOPE IT SELLS REALLY WELL AND YOU BUY A GOOD BIT FOR YOUR COLLECTION THANKS 
ANNE YOU'RE A LOCAL GIRL AREN'T YOU ORIGINALLY FROM SCOTLAND SO WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE 
MY FATHER WAS AN ARCHITECT SO WE USED TO MOVE AROUND 
WHENEVER HE WENT TO A DIFFERENT JOB SO I STARTED UP IN DUNFERMLINE AND MOVED DOWN TO HERTFORDSHIRE 
THEN I MET MY HUSBAND AND MOVED TO WALES A WELSHMAN HE IS 
NOW YOU'RE LIVING IN CARDIFF AND YOU'VE BROUGHT ALONG A WHOLE FAMILY BY THE LOOKS OF IT 
DO YOU COLLECT THESE CHARACTER JUGS NO MY GRANDMOTHER COLLECTED THEM 
AND SHE LEFT THEM TO ME IN HER WILL DO YOU LIKE THEM I THINK THEY'RE VERY DECORATIVE 
THAT WAS A VERY POLITE ANSWER 
I BET THEY HAVEN'T BEEN OUT OF THAT BOX YOU BROUGHT THEM IN FOR YEARS 
THEY'VE BEEN IN OUR LOFT SINCE I HAD THEM AND IT'S A SHAME THEY'RE HIDDEN WHEN SOMEONE MIGHT APPRECIATE THEM 
O. K. SO IT IS A FAMILY HEIRLOOM AS SUCH YOU'VE INHERITED THEM HAVE YOU ANY KIDS 
I HAVE THREE CHILDREN THEY SHOULD BE INHERITING THESE 
YES THEY SHOULD GIRLS I'VE GOT ONE DAUGHTER DOES SHE LIKE THEM 
I DON'T THINK SHE'S ACTUALLY SEEN THEM 
I DON'T THINK SO NO SHE'S SEVENTEEN SHE WOULDN'T LIKE THEM NO 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DO LIKE THEM AND THIS WHOLE CHARACTERISING OF A DRINKING VESSEL OR JUG 
DATES BACK WELL INTO THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY WITH THE BELLARMINE JARS 
MADE IN THE RHINELAND AND YOU HAD A LITTLE FACE OF CARDINAL BELLARMINE ON IT AND HE GOT DRUNK A LOT 
AND HE WAS A LITTLE FAT FIGURE AND THEY'D DECORATE THE NECK OF THE BOTTLE WITH HIM 
AND IN VICTORIAN TIMES TOBY JUGS WERE REALLY POPULAR 
AND THIS WHOLE THING HAS CARRIED ON RIGHT UP TO THE PRESENT DAY 
AND DOULTON DO MAKE TOBY JUGS 
BUT THESE ARE AN EXTENSION OF TOBY JUGS CHARACTER JUGS 
THERE'S ONE HERE THAT I THINK IS PROBABLY THE MOST COLLECTABLE 
AND THAT'S MERLIN THE WIZARD 
AND HE'S GOT AN OWL ON HIM THE DECORATORS REALLY DO LIKE OWLS 
THEY DO MAKE THEM IN FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES THIS IS THE LARGEST SIZE YOU CAN BUY 
WE'VE GOT TWENTY ONE HERE 
I THINK TWENTY ONE THIS SIZE IS A BIT OVER THE TOP SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA FLOG THIS ONE YOU'LL KEEP THIS ONE 
YES LET THE KIDS FIGHT OVER THIS ONE 
THIS IS A VERY COLLECTABLE SIZE AS THEY'RE NOT TOO BIG OR SMALL IT'S THE SECOND SIZE DOWN FROM THIS ONE 
THE NEXT ONE IS ABOUT A THIRD LESS 
AND THE ONE AT THE VERY BOTTOM IS A QUARTER OF ITS SIZE 
THEY'RE TINY WE CAN'T SEE THOSE VERY WELL 
SO THEY'RE NOT WORTH COLLECTING YOU'VE A LOT MORE THOUGH YES 
THEY WERE DISPLAYED IN MY GRANDMOTHER'S DINING ROOM ON THE SHELF A REAL AVID COLLECTOR 
AND HAD TO DUST THEM ALL EXACTLY THEY PUT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DESIGNED FOR 
THERE'S A FEW EARLY ONES HERE SOME NINETEEN FORTIES ONES 
AND MOST ARE NINETEEN SIXTIES I'D LIKE TO PUT THEM INTO FOUR GROUPS OF FIVE 
AND LET'S HAVE FIVE IN EACH GROUP OBVIOUSLY ONE GROUP HAS SIX 
AS YOU'VE GOT TWENTY ONE 
AND I THINK THEIR VALUE IS AROUND TWENTY EACH 
SO REALLY THERE IS A TABLE FULL HERE OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY 
SHALL WE FLOG THEM THEN 
YES I'M SURE MY GRANDMOTHER WOULDN'T MIND AT ALL 
JUNE AND GRAHAM THANK YOU FOR COMING ALONG TODAY 
WHAT HAVE YOU BROUGHT WELL A PICTURE MY MOTHER HAD 
IT WAS GIVEN TO HER BY HER MOTHER AND MY MOTHER'S RECENTLY DIED 
AND NOW IT'S COME INTO MY POSSESSION YOU DON'T WANT IT 
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE SORT OF THING THAT I THINK IS VERY PRETTY AND IT WOULDN'T GO IN OUR MODERN HOME 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON GRAHAM I'D RATHER HAVE A FISHING REEL 
IT'S A REAL DIFFICULTY AS YOU CAN HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S COME ALL THE WAY DOWN THE FAMILY LINE 
AND IT ENDS UP WITH YOU AND YOU DON'T LIKE IT SO WHAT DO YOU DO 
CREATE A NEW FAMILY HEIRLOOM I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT SO 
MY SON LIKES BACKPACKING AND TRAVELS PRETTY LIGHT 
SO I DON'T THINK HE'S INTERESTED IN INHERITING ANYTHING FROM US AT ALL 
YOU SAID IT WAS A PICTURE WE CALL THIS A CRISTOLEUM 
BASICALLY IT'S A PROCESS WHERE AN ENGRAVING OR PRINT WOULD HAVE BEEN LAID ONTO THE BACK OF THE GLASS 
AND VARIOUS PARTS CUT OUT AND COLOURED IN OCCASIONALLY THEY'RE SIGNED 
IT'S QUITE A ROMANTIC LITTLE SCENE THESE TWO YOUNG CHILDREN IN A COURTYARD 
AND HE'S PUTTING HIS FINGER LIKE THAT MAYBE SCOLDING THE OTHER 
OR JUST TELLING THEM A SECRET A LOT OF THESE WERE PRODUCED IN AMERICA 
THEY'RE QUITE COLLECTABLE 
A LOT OF THESE GET DAMAGED CRACKS IN THE CORNERS 
BUT THIS IS IN QUITE GOOD ORDER AND THEY WERE VERY COLLECTABLE 
I THINK THE MARKET'S HARDENED FOR THEM A LITTLE BIT 
AND I'D ESTIMATE THIS AT AUCTION BETWEEN FORTY AND SIXTY 
AND PUT A RESERVE ON IT AT THIRTY HAPPY TO PUT THAT IN 
YES I THINK SO THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY IT'D GET BROKEN 
THEN IT AIN'T WORTH ANYTHING 
GRAHAM HAPPY WITH THE FORTY TO SIXTY ESTIMATE 
YEP I'LL GO WITH THE BOSS GO WITH THE BOSS 
IT'S THE BOSS'S MUM'S MUM SO IT'S HER DECISION AS LONG AS IT GOES TO A GOOD HOME 
NOW SURINDER AND GRAMANDER WHEN YOU FIND SOMETHING IN A HOUSE 
IT'S A BIT OF ROLLED UP CARPET OR A DEAD RAT OR A BIRD THAT'S FALLEN DOWN THE CHIMNEY 
AND IN YOUR CASE YOU'RE A BIT LUCKIER THAN MOST YOU FOUND THIS 
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT I MOVED INTO A FLAT FOUR WEEKS AGO 
AND WE WERE HAVING A RUMMAGE WHEN WE MOVED IN ME AND MY BROTHER 
AND WE FOUND A FEW ITEMS HOW BRILLIANT WHAT ELSE DID YOU FIND 
WE FOUND A FEW BOTTLES OF UNOPENED WHISKY 
ABOVE A DOWNSTAIRS TOILET I OPENED A LITTLE CUPBOARD 
AND THERE IT WAS AT THE BACK 
YOU DON'T OFTEN FIND THAT SORT OF THING 
IT'S KNOWN AS A SEXTANT IT WAS CALLED THAT AS IT WAS A SIXTH OF A CIRCLE 
IT SUPERSEDED AN INSTRUMENT KNOWN AS A QUADRANT 
QUADRANTS WERE USED FROM ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY AND SEXTANTS FROM ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY 
THE IDEA WAS YOU'D TAKE THE INSTRUMENT AND FIND SOMETHING 
CELESTIAL IF IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE YOU'D TAKE THE NORTH STAR 
FIND THAT LOOK THROUGH YOUR EYEPIECE 
AND THEN IT REFLECTS IN THE MIRROR HERE AND WHEN THE REFLECTION APPEARS ON THE HORIZON 
YOU'D READ OFF THE SILVER GAUGE HERE 
IT'S ALSO SIGNED J. J. STILES OF SUNDERLAND 
SEXTANTS ARE AN ABSOLUTE MINEFIELD 
THEY REALLY ARE BUT WHAT WE CAN SAY IS A PRE AUCTION ESTIMATE GUARANTEED TO MAKE THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT IS THAT ALL RIGHT 
THAT'S A MONTH OFF THE MORTGAGE ANYWAY 
BUT I THINK IT MIGHT MAKE MORE 
IF THIS IS A GOOD MAKER IT'S UP TO THE AUCTIONEER TO DO THEIR RESEARCH 
I THINK IT'LL DO WELL IT'S GOT ALL ITS PARTS THE ORIGINAL LACQUERED BRASS 
IT HASN'T BEEN POLISHED OR CLEANED THE BOX IS IN WHAT WE CALL COUNTRY HOUSE CONDITION 
IN OTHER WORDS TATTY BUT IT'S EXACTLY HOW YOU WANT TO SEE IT 
I THOUGHT OF PUTTING BRASS POLISH ON THERE BUT I THOUGHT NO 
OH GOOD JOB YOU JUST HAVE TO TOUCH IT AND THE COLOUR COMES BACK 
BRASSO ON THIS WOULD HAVE KILLED IT 
I KNOW YOU PUT THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED ON IT BUT IS IT WORTH PUTTING A RESERVE ON IT 
YEAH I THINK WE SHOULD 
THIS IS A VERY SPECIALIST ITEM WE'RE TAKING IT TO A GENERAL SALE 
IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD SALE BUT NOT A SPECIALIST SALE OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS 
AT THE END OF THE DAY IF THERE AREN'T THE RIGHT PEOPLE THERE 
AND IT'S NOT ADVERTISED TO THAT SECTION OF THE MARKET IT WON'T MAKE THE MONEY SO RESERVE ESSENTIAL 
SEE WHAT WE CAN GET OFF THE PRICE OF THE HOUSE TAKE A BIT OFF THE MORTGAGE OFF O. K. 
ONE OF THE GREAT CENTREPIECES OF WELSH HISTORY 
IS THIS BUILDING IT'S CARDIFF CASTLE 
IT'S UNDERGOING SOME RESTORATION 
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS SCAFFOLDING 
THAT DOESN'T BOTHER US BECAUSE IT'S THE INSIDE WE'RE INTERESTED IN 
THE AUSTERE WALLS OF THIS FORTRESS GIVE NO HINT 
TO THE AMOUNT OF EXUBERANCE WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE 
OH GOSH THIS CERTAINLY DOES HAVE THE WOW FACTOR 
IT'S THE BANQUETING HALL AND IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST ROOMS HERE 
IT SYMBOLISES THE TONE AND STYLE OF THE INTERIORS 
IT IS TOTAL ARCHITECTURAL FANTASIA EACH ROOM IS THEMED LIKE THIS ONE 
IN THIS ROOM IT DEPICTS THE MEDIEVAL HISTORY OF THE CASTLE 
SHOWN WITH THE MOST WONDERFUL PAINTED ILLUSTRATIONS ON THE WALLS 
EVEN THE FIREPLACE TELLS PART OF THE STORY 
JUST LOOK UP HERE THE SECOND NORMAN LORD OF GLAMORGAN 
RIDING TO BATTLE ON HIS HORSE IN ALL HIS GLORY 
BELOW IN THE DUNGEON IS THE SON OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR 
WHO WAS IMPRISONED IN THE CASTLE 
THE DETAIL IN THE PLASTERWORK IS EXTRAORDINARY FULL OF RELIEF 
WE HAVE A SALMON HERE POPPING OUT OF THE WALL 
THERE'S A LITTLE LIZARD IF YOU FOLLOW THE DETAIL 
ALL THE WAY ROUND IT ENDS WITH A TINY LITTLE MOUSE ON THE OTHER SIDE 
THE ROOMS WAS COMPLETED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY 
TOWARDS THE END OF THE VICTORIAN ERA YET LOOKING AT IT 
IT LOOKS LIKE A BANQUETING HALL FROM THE MIDDLE AGES 
TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S SO WE'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO ITS CREATORS 
MUCH OF THE GLAMOUR OF THIS TWO THOUSAND YEAR OLD BUILDING DATES FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SIX 
IT'S DOWN TO TWO MEN THE THEN OWNER THE THIRD MARQUIS OF BUTE 
AND THE ECCENTRIC GOTHIC REVIVAL ARCHITECT WILLIAM BURGES 
LORD BUTE WAS NOT ONLY ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN OF HIS DAY 
BUT A GREAT ENTHUSIAST OF THE MIDDLE AGES 
WILLIAM BURGES HAD A LOVE OF THE GROTESQUE AND WEIRD 
AND A KEEN PASSION FOR GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE 
TOGETHER THEY FORMED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL PARTNERSHIPS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THEY CREATED A MOSAIC OF FANTASY ROOMS THAT WERE BOTH 
INTELLECTUALLY IMPRESSIVE AND NEW TO THE VICTORIAN ERA 
YET IRONICALLY THEIR DESIGNS WERE INSPIRED 
BY THE GOTHIC STYLE OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY 
BUT IT WASN'T ALL HIGHBROW 
BURGES'S CREATIVE AND WICKED SENSE OF HUMOUR DID ADD SOME LIGHT RELIEF TO HIS WORK 
AS I CAN SHOW YOU IN THIS EXAMPLE HERE 
LOOK AT THIS LITTLE BABY SLIDING DOWN THE BANISTER 
I EXPECT BURGES HAD DONE THAT AS A LAD 
AND IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE ALL WANTED TO DO 
BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS CROCODILE SITTING HERE SNAPPING AWAY 
READY TO SPOIL ALL OF THE FUN 
I MENTIONED EARLIER THE IMPORTANCE OF THEMES THROUGHOUT THE ROOMS IN THE CASTLE 
THIS ROOM IS NO EXCEPTION IT'S THE WINTER SMOKING ROOM 
AND IT'S SITUATED IN THE CLOCK TOWER SO NOT SURPRISINGLY 
ITS DECORATIVE THEME IS TIME 
WHAT I LIKE WHEN YOU LOOK UP YOU CAN SEE THE RICHLY DECORATED 
TWELVE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC IN THE VAULTED CEILING 
BUT ALSO YOU'VE GOT THE FOUR SEASONS IN EACH GOTHIC ARCH 
UP HERE WE'VE GOT AUTUMN WINTER 
SPRING AND FINALLY UP HERE SUMMER 
BURGES WAS A PERFECTIONIST AND HE LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED IN HIS DESIGNS 
NOT EVEN IN THE WINDOWS IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY 
YOU SEE THAT THEY TOO SYMBOLISE TIME 
THE STAINED GLASS SHOWS THE DAYS OF THE WEEK 
STARTING HERE WE'VE GOT MONDAY TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY 
TUESDAY IS IN THE MIDDLE WITH TYR 
AND WEDNESDAY IS ON THE FAR END HERE WITH WODEN 
EVEN THOUGH LORD BUTE ONLY SPENT SIX WEEKS A YEAR HERE 
EVERY ROOM EVEN THE LEAST USED ONES WERE RICHLY AND HIGHLY DECORATED 
THIS IS THE SUMMER SMOKING ROOM AND IT HAS A DAZZLING ARRAY OF COLOUR 
IT REFLECTS LORD BUTE'S LOVE FOR ASTROLOGY 
IF YOU LOOK UP AT THE DOME YOU SEE THE STARS AND CONSTELLATIONS 
AND THE FOUR ELEMENTS EARTH AIR FIRE AND WATER 
SUSPENDED FROM THE DOME IS THIS MAGNIFICENT GILDED BRONZE CHANDELIER 
IN THE FORM OF APOLLO THE SUN GOD 
HE'S STANDING ON HIS CHARIOT WHEEL AND THE SPOKES OF THE WHEEL ARE THE RAYS OF THE SUN 
EVERYBODY'S HARD AT IT HERE AT THE COAL EXCHANGE IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL 
NOW IT'S TIME TO GO OVER TO THE AUCTION ROOM AND PUT THE VALUATIONS TO THE TEST 
HERE'S A QUICK RECAP OF ALL THE ITEMS UNDER THE HAMMER 
TED FOUND THIS BOOKMARK IN A SKIP 
BUT WILL IT FIND FORTY TO SIXTY 
SUSAN'S HOPING THAT TWENTY ONE TOBY JUGS SHE INHERITED 
WILL TURN INTO A TIDY SUM 
JEAN AND GRAHAM'S HOUSE IS TOO MODERN FOR THEIR CRISTOLEUM 
BUT WILL IT GO FOR FORTY TO SIXTY 
AND GRAMANDER AND SURINDER ARE HOPING 
THE SEXTANT WILL LEAD TO A FORTUNE 
QUESTION IS WILL THE BIDDERS GO CRAZY FOR OUR LOTS 
WE'LL FIND OUT IN A MOMENT BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE ALL THE ACTION WILL TAKE PLACE 
THE ATHENIAN AUCTION ROOMS IN CARDIFF 
BEFORE THE HAMMER GOES DOWN LET'S CATCH UP WITH RYAN BEECH TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY WISE WORDS 
I LOVE THIS LOT IT'S MY FAVOURITE THING IN THE SALE 
I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT SEXTANTS BUT IT LOOKS A PRETTY GOOD ONE 
IT'S NOT THE GENERAL NINETEENTH CENTURY STANDARD ROYAL NAVY ISSUE 
IT BELONGS TO THE SINGH BROTHERS AND THEY FOUND IT IN A CUPBOARD 
A LUCKY FIND THIS ONE IS LACQUERED BRASS SO IT'S MORE DECORATIVE 
YOU DO SEE THEM EBONISED OR BLACK LACQUERED YEAH 
SO IT'S GOT THAT DECORATIVE ELEMENT 
THE SORT OF THING SOMEONE WITH A NAUTICAL INTEREST WOULD BUY 
AND IT'LL SIT ON A SIDEBOARD AND BE POLISHED AND LOOK THE PART YES 
AND PEOPLE WILL SAY WHAT'S THAT 
JAMES LEWIS THE EXPERT PUT THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED ON THIS 
I IT'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO MAKE FIVE HUNDRED 
THREE HUNDRED WOULD BE ITS UPPER LIMIT 
I'D HAVE SAID MAYBE TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED 
ENCOURAGE THE BUYERS IN AT TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED 
YES AND IT'S A FAIRLY CONSTRICTED MARKET AS TO WHO'S GOING TO WANT IT 
IF YOU HAVE A NAUTICAL INTEREST YOU'RE THERE STRAIGHT AWAY 
BUT IT NARROWS YOUR MARKET A BIT 
WE ARE ON THE WEBSITE THE INTERNET PLAYS A MAJOR PART IT DOES 
I THINK THIS WILL FIND THE RIGHT BUYER I'M GOING TO BE OPTIMISTIC 
SOMEONE'S GOT TO BE MR. PESSIMIST 
REALIST I WOULD SAY 
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THAT WONDERFUL CRISTOLEUM TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
WITH THAT LOVELY IMAGE OF TWO CHILDREN PLAYING VALUATION FORTY TO SIXTY 
IT BELONGS TO JEAN AND GRAHAM 
IT WAS YOUR MUM'S OR YOUR GRANDMA'S 
MY GRANDMOTHER'S FIRST THEN MY MOTHER'S AND THEN MINE 
WE HAVE A GREAT VALUATION I THINK THIS COULD DO MORE 
I JUST THINK THAT IN THIS BUSINESS THINGS GO IN TRENDS 
CRISTOLEUMS WERE VERY POPULAR YEARS AGO AND I THINK THE MARKET MIGHT HAVE TOUGHENED UP BUT WE'LL SEE

IN AN IDEAL WORLD IT OUGHT TO DO WELL IT'S A PURE COLLECTORS' PIECE 
FOR SOMEONE WHO COLLECTS STEVENGRAPHS IT'S AN UNUSUAL THING 
I REALLY HOPE IT DOES WELL 
IT WOULD DO WELL IN COVENTRY WE'RE NOT IN COVENTRY BUT
