BUT NEXT TIME THEY WENT TO GRAN'S THE RED LEAVES HAD ALL GONE 
DON'T WORRY SAID GRAN IT'S NEARLY WINTER 
LEAVES ALWAYS FALL OFF THIS TIME OF THE YEAR THEY'LL BE BACK 
ALL THROUGH THE WINTER 
BEN AND CHARLIE VISITED THE TREE TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
BEN NOTICED THAT THERE WERE LITTLE GREEN BUMPS ON IT 
THEY'RE BUDS SAID GRAN 
SOON THEY'LL TURN INTO LEAVES 
GRAN WAS RIGHT THE TREE DID GROW LEAVES BUT THEY WERE DIFFERENT 
THESE LEAVES ARE GREEN SAID CHARLIE WHERE ARE THE RED ONES 
AH WELL SAID GRAN YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT TILL AUTUMN COMES ROUND 
THE BOYS DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT 
BUT SOON IT WAS SUMMER AND THEY ALMOST FORGOT THE TREE 
NEXT TIME THEY WENT TO GRAN'S THE LEAVES HAD TURNED YELLOW 
THEY LIKED THE YELLOW BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE RED 
THEN IT WAS AUTUMN AND THE LEAVES WERE RED AGAIN 
HURRAY SAID CHARLIE RED IS BEST 
SOON THEY'LL BE GONE WON'T THEY ASKED BEN 
THAT'S RIGHT 
AND NEXT YEAR THEY'LL GROW ALL OVER AGAIN 
GREEN YELLOW AND RED SAID CHARLIE 
AND GRAN GAVE THEM EACH ONE RED LEAF TO TAKE HOME
