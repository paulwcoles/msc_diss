THE HAMMER BY ANDY NARRELL 
YES 
YOU'VE TUNED INTO CARIBBEAN ISLAND RADIO 
THE STATION WHICH TAKES YOU ALL AROUND THE ISLANDS OF THE CARIBBEAN 
I'M ANGIE GREAVES BROADCASTING TO EACH AND EVERY CARIBBEAN NATION 
WHERE THE LANDSCAPE IS VARIED MOUNTAINS FRINGE VALLEYS 
RIVERS GURGLE AND FLOW 
AND FORESTS ARE HOME TO A RICH VARIETY OF WILDLIFE 
I'M SENDING GOOD WISHES TO MORE THAN EIGHTY ISLANDS 
IN THIS AREA 
THE ATLANTIC IS TO THE EAST THE CARIBBEAN SEA TO THE WEST 
WE START IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF 
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL ISLAND 
DOMINICA IS A RAINFOREST COVERED ISLAND WITH BUMPY MOUNTAINS 
PUSHED UP BY VOLCANIC ACTIVITY MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO 
EVIDENCE OF VOLCANOES STILL SEEPS THROUGH IN HOT SULPHUR SPRINGS 
THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH FLAT LAND SO ROADS TWIST THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS 
IT'S A FINE DAY TO START AT 
THE SOUTHERNMOST POINT OF DOMINICA 
ON THE EAST SIDE THE ROUGH 
BUT IT'S MUCH CALMER ON THE WEST THAT'S THE 
LET'S SAY HI TO SOME YOUNGSTERS 
THEY'RE GOING TO THE CAPITAL ROSEAU VIA THE TOWNS OF BELLES AND MARIGOT 
ROSEAU BELLES MARIGOT 
LET'S GO 
I'M GUSTAVE WILLIAMS AND THIS IS MY BUS 
OUR JOURNEY BEGINS HERE IN SCOTTS HEAD 
THIS TRIP WILL TAKE US RIGHT ACROSS THE ISLAND 
TEST DRIVE BY W. C. K. 
THIS IS WHAT I CALL GREAT TRAVELLING MUSIC 
HEAD NORTH FROM SCOTTS HEAD TOWARDS ROSEAU THE CAPITAL OF DOMINICA 
DOMINICA IS JUST TWENTY FIVE K. M. WIDE 
THE MOUNTAINS MEAN THERE IS NO DIRECT ROUTE FROM COAST TO COAST 
THIS MUSIC HAS TO KEEP US GOING 
HELLO ROSEAU CAPITAL AND DOMINICA'S LARGEST CITY 
IT'S THE MOST BUILT UP AREA OF THE ISLAND 
ROSEAU IS BUILT ON FLATTER LAND BUT THE MOUNTAINS LOOK DOWN ON IT 
BEYOND ROSEAU IS THE ROSEAU VALLEY WHERE PEOPLE BUILD ON FLATTER LAND 
THIS IS WHERE WE SAY GOODBYE TO EDMUND 
ANYONE FOR THE ROSEAU VALLEY YES JUST BY THE SIGN PLEASE 
I'M EDMUND ROBINSON I'M TWELVE 
I LIVE IN THE ROSEAU VALLEY IN A SMALL TOWN NAMED ELMSHALL 
I WALK THROUGH BATH ESTATE WHERE THERE ARE MANY SHOPS AND HOUSES 
THIS IS THE ROSEAU RIVER 
YOU CROSS THE RIVER INTO 
THIS IS THE FLATTEST AREA IN DOMINICA 
HOUSES ARE BUILT IN THE VALLEY 
THERE ARE ALSO HOMES ON TOP OF THE HILLS 
THIS IS MY HOME IT IS A TWO STOREY BUILDING I'M NOT GOING IN NOW 
I WANT TO RIDE MY BIKE 
IT IS EASY TO RIDE MY BIKE HERE BECAUSE IT IS VERY FLAT 
SOMETIMES I EVEN FORGET I'M SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAINS 
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY INTO CENTRAL DOMINICA AND THAT'S UP 
WE'RE MOVING ON UP INLAND WHERE THE LANDSCAPE IS STEEP AND MOUNTAINOUS 
THE SLOPES ARE SO STEEP THAT ROADS HAVE TO WEAVE IN AND OUT 
DID ANYONE BRING A SHIRT IT'S GETTING COOLER AS WE CLIMB HIGHER 
THE MOUNTAINOUS INTERIOR GETS A MASSIVE SIX THIRTY FIVE C. M. OF RAIN A YEAR 
THE FERTILE SOIL IS CONSTANTLY WATERED 
YOU'LL SEE PLANTATIONS AND LOTS OF FRUIT BEARING TREES 
WE'RE APPROACHING BELLES WHERE I LIVE THERE IS A RIVER CLOSE BY 
DOMINICA HAS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE RIVERS ONE FOR EACH DAY OF THE YEAR 
ANYBODY STOPPING AT BELLES SCHOOL YES I AM 
I'M LENA DURAND I'M ELEVEN YEARS OLD THIS IS MY SCHOOL 
IT'S NOT FAR FROM MY HOME 
I'VE ALWAYS LIVED IN BELLES 
IT'S CALLED THE WETLANDS BECAUSE IT RAINS SO MUCH OF THE YEAR 
THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE SO HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS OF THE RAINFOREST 
MY DADDY IS A FARMER 
HE FARMS BANANA CITRUS FRUIT AND 
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT DASHEEN 
IT'S A ROOT CROP WITH A LARGE GREEN LEAF YOU HAVE TO DIG IT OUT 
AFTER CLEANING YOU BOIL IT LIKE A POTATO M. M. M. THEY TASTE GOOD 
LENA WILL BOIL ONE FOR HER DINNER 
BUT IT'S GOODBYE TO LENA AND TUNE IN ON OUR TRAVELS AGAIN 
THIS TUNE IS FOR GUSTAVE WILLIAMS WHO DOES THIS TRIP TWICE A DAY 
IT'S A DOWNHILL DRIVE NOW LEAVING BEHIND LUSH MOUNTAIN SLOPES 
WE'RE GOING TO THE NORTH EAST COAST 
IT'S RUGGED AND ROCKY BECAUSE OF THE STRONG ATLANTIC WINDS 
THE WAVES BEAT AWAY AT THE SHORELINE CREATING BAYS AND ROCKY HEADLANDS 
FISH GATHER THERE SO FISHING VILLAGES SPRING UP 
WE'RE APPROACHING MARIGOT OUR LAST STOP 
I'M KAREN THOMAS I'M YANNICK JEREMY 
WELCOME TO MARIGOT MARIGOT IS A FISHING VILLAGE 
FISH IS ALWAYS IN DEMAND 
I COME DOWN HERE MOST DAYS AFTER SCHOOL 
MY GRANDMA IS A DATA COLLECTOR AT MARIGOT PORT 
SHE RECORDS AND WEIGHS THE FISH AS THE CATCH IS BROUGHT IN 
I HELP HER 
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY I'LL LEAVE THESE PEOPLE TO LOOK AFTER THE FISH 
TRANSMISSION ENDS FOR NOW IN DOMINICA 
WE'LL HOOK UP WITH THE REST OF THE CARIBBEAN OR THE WEST INDIES 
THE ISLANDS ARE IN A CURVING LINE AN ISLAND CHAIN 
IT LINKS NORTH AMERICA TO SOUTH AMERICA 
CLOSEST TO NORTH AMERICA JUST OFF FLORIDA ARE THE BAHAMAS 
CUBA IS THE LARGEST ISLAND BUT THERE ARE SMALLER ONES TOO 
MANY OF THE ISLANDS HAVE BEEN MADE BY UNDERSEA VOLCANOES 
THE VOLCANO IN MONSERRAT IS ACTIVE 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IN MARTINIQUE THEY SPEAK FRENCH 
BUT IN GRENADA ENGLISH IS THE MAIN LANGUAGE 
FURTHEST SOUTH ARE TRINIDAD AND AMP TOBAGO TWO ISLANDS BUT ONE NATION 
TRINIDAD IS THE CLOSEST ISLAND TO SOUTH AMERICA 
TRINIDAD IS ONE OF THE LARGEST ISLANDS 
IT'S MOUNTAINOUS IN THE NORTH 
THE NORTHERN RANGE MOUNTAINS TOWER OVER FLATTER PLAINS IN THE SOUTH 
ALONG THE COAST THERE ARE MANY WETLANDS 
THEY ARE FLAT WITH DENSE VEGETATION 
THESE ENVIRONMENTS ARE HOME TO MUCH WILDLIFE 
RED HOWLER MONKEYS BARK DAY AND NIGHT 
WHITE FACED CAPUCHINS SHYLY PEER THROUGH THE TREES 
WETLANDS ARE IDEAL BREEDING AREAS FOR BIRDS 
IN SMALL COUNTRIES ANIMAL HABITATS ARE OFTEN CLOSE TO BUILT UP AREAS 
INDUSTRY CAN CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR WILDLIFE 
THE PETROTRIN PETROL PROCESSING PLANT AT POINT A PIERRE 
IS BUILT ALONG A COASTAL WETLAND AREA 
THE HEAVY MACHINERY THERE IS COOLED BY WATER HELD IN RESERVOIRS 
WATER FROM THESE RESERVOIRS IS PIPED INTO A CONSERVATION AREA 
TO CREATE ARTIFICIAL LAKES 
THESE LAKES ARE SAFE ENVIRONMENTS FOR ENDANGERED WILD FOWL 
THE WILDFOWL TRUST IS RUN BY VOLUNTEERS AND EXPERTS 
THIS IS OUR BREEDING AREA WE WORK WITH ENDANGERED WATERFOWL 
THE BIRDS ARE ENDANGERED BECAUSE OF OVERHUNTING AND POLLUTION 
WE BREED THE BIRDS FOR RELEASE INTO THEIR NATURAL HABITAT LET'S GO 
THESE ARE OUR SCARLET IBIS 
WE BREED THEM FOR RELEASE BECAUSE THEY ARE ENDANGERED 
IN THE SWAMP WHERE THEY'RE FOUND THEY FEED ON A RED CRAB 
THE CAROTIN IN THE CRAB MAKES THEM RED THE SAME CAROTIN AS IN CARROTS 
IF YOU LOOK UP THERE YOU'LL SEE THEIR BABIES 
AFTER SIX MONTHS THEY START GOING RED AND LOOK AS NICE AS THE ADULTS 
AT THAT TIME WE FREE THEM IN THE SWAMPS WHERE THEY'D NORMALLY LIVE 
LET'S START THE MUSIC UP AGAIN AND HEAD NORTH 
THE CARONI SWAMP IS A NATURAL WETLAND LANDSCAPE 
THIS IS DEDICATED TO THE CONSERVATIONISTS WHO TOUR THE AREA 
MOTHER EARTH BY BROTHER RESISTANCE 
I'M LESTER I'M IN THE CARONI SWAMP A NATURAL HABITAT FOR WETLAND LIFE 
WHAT KEEPS THE ENVIRONMENT GOING IS THE MANGROVE TREES 
THIS IS A SEEDLING FROM THE RED MANGROVE TREE 
IT'S LIKE A PENCIL IT GROWS LIKE THIS ON THE TREE 
WHEN IT FALLS INTO THE WATER IT FLOATS LIKE THIS 
THIS END GETS THE ROOTS THEN IT FLOATS LIKE THIS 
IT STICKS IN THE MUD BANK AND STARTS ANOTHER TREE 
THE CRISSCROSS LANDSCAPE OF ROOTS KEEPS THE SILT AND SOIL TOGETHER 
THERE'S A SNAKE ON THE TREE 
LET ME GET CLOSER TO IT 
THEY FEED ON BIRDS HE PROBABLY HAD ONE THERE AND IS RELAXING NOW 
HE'LL STAY THERE ABOUT A WEEK 
IF HE'S DISTURBED HE'LL MOVE BEFORE THAT 
THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT THE BIRDS COME IN TO ROOST AT NIGHT 
THE RED ONES ARE SCARLET IBIS OUR NATIONAL BIRD 
I THINK THE SCARLET IBIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BIRD IN THE WORLD 
IT WOULD BE SAD IF THEY DIED OUT 
THAT'S THE END OF OUR DAY AS THE SCARLET IBIS SETTLE FOR THE NIGHT 
FREE IN THE CARONI SWAMP OR NESTING SAFELY IN THE WILDFOWL TRUST 
CARIBBEAN ISLAND RADIO SAYS GOODBYE TO YOU IN THE VALLEY 
IN THE MOUNTAINS 
OR BY THE SEA
