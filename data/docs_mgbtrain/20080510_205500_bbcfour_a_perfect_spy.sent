THE NEW COMMITTEE THAT HE DERIDED SO MUCH WAS SHAPING UP TO BE A VERY HIGH POWERED OUTFIT 
MAYBE THE BEST RELATIONSHIP WE'VE HAD WITH THE AMERICANS FOR YEARS 
ARE YOU LISTENING 
THE AMERICANS OBJECTED TO YOUR HUSBAND'S PRESENCE ON THE COMMITTEE 
AND ASKED ME TO REPLACE HIM 
I SAID NO I ORDERED MAGNUS TO GO ON LEAVE AND STAY CLEAR OF VIENNA TILL I TOLD HIM TO RETURN 
I HAD HIM CLEARED CLEARED AMERICAN CLEARED LONDON CLEARED 
THAT'S WHAT I DID FOR MAGNUS

I ARGUED WITH YOU IN MY HEAD FOR YEARS 
WHY HAD YOU DONE IT TO HIM 
WHAT POSSIBLE DANGER WAS AXEL TO ANYONE 
HE WASN'T A COMMUNIST HE WASN'T A WAR CRIMINAL HE WAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU 
HIS ONLY CRIMES WERE HIS POVERTY HIS ILLEGAL PRESENCE IN SWITZERLAND AND HIS LAMENESS 
PLUS A CERTAIN FREEDOM IN HIS WAY OF THINKING 
WHICH IN THE EYES OF SOME IS WHAT WE WERE THERE TO PROTECT 
I KNOW NOW OF COURSE THAT YOU HARDLY GAVE IT A THOUGHT 
AXEL WAS JUST A BIT OF BARTER MATERIAL 
YOU LIT YOUR PIPE AND YOU THOUGHT 
HELLO I BET THE OLD SWISSIES WOULD LIKE A SMELL OF THIS ONE 
I'LL POP IT DOWN TO THEM AND EARN MYSELF A BROWNIE POINT 
SERVED ME RIGHT FOR HAVING A FRIEND OUTSIDE THE SERVICE 
HE COULD HAVE A KNIGHTHOOD BY NOW FOR ALL WE KNOW TOBY 
HE COULD BE PRIME MINISTER AND WE'D ONLY EVER HEAR IT FROM THE TELEVISION 
BO BRAMMEL'S PUTTING TOGETHER WHAT HE TERMS THE ALTERNATIVE VIEW 
OH YES HE'S CALLED IN SOME TOP SHRINK WHO SPECIALISES IN HARMLESS NERVOUS BREAKDOWNS 
THEY TOLD HIM TO ASSEMBLE A PROFILE 
OF A LOYAL ENGLISHMAN UNDER SEVERE STRESS WHO'S AROUSING ANXIETY IN OTHERS PARTICULARLY AMERICANS 
WILL THEY FIND HIM MAYBE

I'M DEAD BUT I'M NOT GOING TO THROW YOU TO THE WOLVES 
THERE WAS AN ENTRY IN HIS PERSONAL FILE HE WANTED IT TAKEN OUT 
AND YOU DID IT FOR HIM RAIDED HIS FILE 
WHAT WAS IT 
HE WAS STILL A BOY HE'D BEEN RUNNING SOME LOW GRADE JOE IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA SMALL STUFF 
BUT THERE WAS THIS GIRL CALLED SABINA 
WHO GOT IN ON THE ACT THEN DEFECTED

I DIDN'T LISTEN TOO CLEARLY OH CHRIST 
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD 
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THIS STUFF 
KEPT IT 
I DIDN'T GIVE IT TO HIM HE KNEW I WOULDN'T DO THAT 
WHERE IS IT NOW

IT WAS WHEN THEY BROUGHT MAGNUS BACK FROM WASHINGTON YOU WEREN'T LISTENING TO ANYTHING 
IT WAS THE NIGHT YOU SHOT YOUR DOG 
EXCEPTIONAL YOUNG OFFICER POPULAR AND COURTEOUS 
CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED WITH IMPORTANT SOURCE OF TOP SECRET INTELLIGENCE 
SOURCE'S INSISTENCE ON OPERATING THROUGH PYM ONLY 
INSISTENCE ON OPERATING THROUGH PYM ONLY

OH DEAR

POOR JACK 
THEY'RE HIS JOES YOU SEE IT'S THE STRAIN 
THEY'RE NOT MY JOES AND THEY NEVER WERE 
FRANKEL WHEN THIS SERVICE CATCHES SOMEONE ELSE'S JOE IF IT EVER DOES THESE DAYS WHAT DOES IT DO 
WE'RE NOT TRAINING SCHOOL KIDDIES

WHY TO SHOW THE OPPOSITION THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED 
WE DON'T HIDE HIS CAR AND CLOSE HIS HOUSE MAGIC HIM AWAY 
WE DON'T SANDBAG RADIO OPERATORS IN FULL FLOW 
THAT IS THE VERY LAST THING WE DO RIGHT 
I DON'T READ YOU JACK I DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE DOES 
UNLESS I THINK YOU'RE UPSET AND GETTING A BIT METAPHYSICAL 
UNLESS YOU WANT THE OPPOSITION TO KNOW YOU'RE ROLLING UP THEIR NETWORK 
WE NEVER HAD A BLOODY NETWORK 
THOSE AREN'T THE CROWN JEWELS PYM HAS IN THE BURNBOX 
HE TOOK IT TO KEEP US GUESSING 
THEY OWNED THOSE JOES FROM DAY ONE 
THEY PAID THE ACTORS WROTE THE SCRIPT 
THEY OWNED PYM 
AND NEAR ENOUGH OWNED ME 
THEY OWNED ALL OF YOU TOO 
YOU JUST HAVEN'T WOKEN UP TO IT 
BUT JACK WHY WOULD THEY BOTHER TO TELL US ANYTHING AT ALL 
WHY FAKE THE SIGNAL WHY PRETEND THEY'VE PICKED UP THE JOES 
BECAUSE THEY WANT US TO THINK THEY'VE GOT PYM AND THEY HAVEN'T 
IT'S THE ONLY LIE THEY'VE GOT LEFT 
THEY WANT US TO CALL OFF THE HUNT AND GO HOME TO OUR SMOKED SALMON 
THEY WANT TO FIND HIM FOR THEMSELVES 
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS FOR THE DAY 
PYM IS STILL ON THE RUN AND THEY WANT HIM AS MUCH AS WE DO 
DON'T STOP THERE JACK 
NOW TELL US HOW WE FIND HIM 
GET THE POLICE IN IT'S THE ONLY WAY PURE BOBBY WORK 
PLEASE YOURSELVES 
NEARLY FORGOT REMEMBER THAT AMERICAN SIGNALS MAN ARTELLI 
RECKONED HE COULD CRACK THE CODE PYM AND HIS CZECHO CHUM WERE USING 
THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE SHAKESPEARE OR SOMETHING EQUALLY OUT OF DATE 
IF BO YOU'RE STILL TALKING TO THE AMERICANS SUGGEST ARTELLI TRIES SIMPLICISSIMUS 
WHY DID PYM DO IT TOM 
IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE DEED NOT THE MOTIVE LEAST OF ALL THE WORD 
IT WAS HIS OWN CHOICE 
IT WAS HIS OWN LIFE 
NO ONE FORCED HIM 
ANYWHERE ALONG THE LINE OR RIGHT AT THE START HE COULD HAVE YELLED NO AND SURPRISED HIMSELF 
HE NEVER DID 
IT TOOK HIM THIRTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE HE THREW IN THE SPONGE 
AND BY THEN THE LINES WERE DRAWN FOR GOOD THE LINES 
THE POINT IS PYM QUITE FREQUENTLY LOVED THE FIRM ALMOST AS MUCH AS HE LOVED AXEL 
HE ADORED ITS ROUGH UNCOMPREHENDING TRUST IN HIM 
ITS MISUSE OF HIM 
ITS TWEEDY BEARHUGS FLAWED ROMANTICISM AND COCK EYED INTEGRITY 
THE FIRM WAS HOME AND SCHOOL AND COURT TO HIM 
EVEN WHEN HE WAS BETRAYING IT 
HE REALLY FELT HE HAD A LOT TO GIVE IT JUST AS HE HAD A LOT TO GIVE AXEL 
IN HIS IMAGINATION HE SAW HIMSELF WITH CELLARS FULL OF NYLONS AND BLACK MARKET CHOCOLATE 
ENOUGH TO SEE EVERYBODY RIGHT IN EVERY SHORTAGE 
AND NOW OF COURSE PYM HIMSELF WAS THE HERO OF THE FABLE 
I HAVE INFORMATION 
THAT COULD LEAD US BOTH TO MAGNUS' 
I HAD TO SEE HOW YOU DO IT MARY 
IT'S SUCH A CLEVER HOBBY 
IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY AGREED 
THAT THE FO REPORT ON THE LOCAL COST OF LIVING WAS BOTH DISTORTED AND UNFAIR 
AND THAT A FINANCE COMMITTEE WOULD BE FORMED HEADED BY MRS. MCCORMICK 
THE COMMITTEE WILL ITEMISE OUR POINTS FOR THE HEAD OF THE INSPECTORATE HIMSELF 
NOW BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO OTHER BUSINESS 
MARY HOW SORRY WE ARE ABOUT YOUR FATHER IN LAW'S DEATH 
WE KNOW THAT MAGNUS HAS BEEN HIT VERY HARD 
AND WE HOPE HE'LL BE BACK AMONG US SOON WITH HIS USUAL HIGH SPIRITS WHICH WE ALL FIND SO REFRESHING 
THANK YOU 
NO THANKS HONESTLY I'D RATHER JUST TAKE A WALK 
COULD YOU GET MY SCARF PLEASE 
I'D FAR RATHER BE ALONE 
HOW STUPID 
I HAVE INFORMATION THAT COULD LEAD US BOTH TO MAGNUS 
PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING 
ANY AFTERNOON BETWEEN TWO AND SIX YOU WILL TAKE COFFEE AT THE CAFE MOZART 
MR. KONIG WILL COLLECT YOU 
FRAU PYM 
FROM HERR KONIG THANK YOU 
YOU ARE A COURAGEOUS WOMAN 
WHERE IS HE 
AND THAT'S HOW IT WAS TOM 
BETRAYAL IS A REPETITIOUS TRADE AND I WILL NOT BOTHER YOU WITH ANY MORE OF IT 
WE'VE REACHED THE END THOUGH IT SEEMS FROM HERE TO LOOK QUITE LIKE THE BEGINNING 
THERE WAS NO SAVING PYM 
THE TRUTH IS TOM THAT HE PREFERRED TO SIT HERE IN MISS DUBBER'S UPPER ROOM 
AND WAIT FOR GOD TO COME 
WHILE HE LOOKED TOWARDS THE BEACH 
WHERE THE BEST PALS EVER HAD KICKED A FOOTBALL FROM ONE END OF THE WORLD TO THE OTHER 
AND RIDDEN THEIR BICYCLES ACROSS THE SEA 
HIS LAST MESSAGE TO ME WAS' 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ME ANY MORE 
I FELT A GENUINE PANG OF JEALOUSY 
HIS FATHER DIES AND IMMEDIATELY SIR MAGNUS IS FREE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ALL THAT IS ABOUT 
I DON'T KNOW I NEVER MET HIS FATHER 
SO WHAT IS HE IS HE A COMMUNIST 
HE CAN'T BE IT'S TOO RIDICULOUS 
HE'S A SEARCHER ISN'T THAT ENOUGH 
IN OUR PROFESSION I'M SURE WE SHOULD NOT ASK FOR MORE 
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING MARRIED TO AN ARMCHAIR IDEOLOGIST 
I HAD AN UNCLE ONCE WHO WAS A LUTHERAN PASTOR HE BORED US ALL TO DEATH 
MARY QUITE FRANKLY WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE HIM 
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT YOU ANY MORE DOES HE THAT'S WHY HE'S HIDING 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE HE BETRAYED 
OH SIR MAGNUS HATES BLOODSHED THAT NEVER STOPPED ANYONE FROM SHEDDING BLOOD 
WHY DID YOU ASK ME HERE 
MARY LISTEN DO YOU NOT HAVE THE CONSOLING FEELING THAT THERE IS SOMEONE LOOKING AFTER HIM 
I'M SURE THERE IS 
HE HATES TO BE ALONE BECAUSE THEN HIS WORLD IS EMPTY 
SO LOOKING AFTER HIM 
I'LL TAKE A CAB THERE'S A STAND ON THE CORNER 
WHY NOT HIS MOTHER 
NOT LONG AGO HE TALKED TO ME ABOUT HIS MOTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME 
HE SAID HE HAD UNEARTHED HER AND PUT HER IN A HOUSE BY THE SEA HE WAS PROUD OF THIS 
HE SPOKE ABOUT THE WONDERFUL WALKS THEY HAD TOGETHER ON THE BEACH 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THIS HOUSE IS MAYBE HE IS THERE 
HER HOUSE WAS THE FIRST PLACE THEY LOOKED THEY TERRIFIED HER 
HOW DO I GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU IF I NEED YOU THROW A NEWSPAPER OVER THE WALL 
I DON'T THINK YOU WILL NEED ME MARY 
AND MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT THAT HE DOESN'T WANT ME ANY MORE EITHER 
JUST SO LONG AS HE WANTS THAT'S ALL WE MUST WORRY ABOUT IF WE LOVE HIM 
HE'LL FIND AN ANSWER HE ALWAYS DOES 
THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF 
MAGNUS HASN'T GOT A BLOODY MOTHER 
HE GAVE THIS POPPY PART OF THE SAME FANTASY HE'D GIVEN ME 
HAPPY FAMILIES BY THE SEASIDE 
HE'D SAY LET'S GO TO DEVON FOR A HOLIDAY MABS WHEN I WAS IN DEVON 
IT WAS FARLEIGH ABBOT ALWAYS 
WHEN RICK USED TO PICK ME UP FROM SCHOOL 
IT WAS HIS IDEAL PLACE 
SAFE INNOCENT 
BEFORE 
PEOPLE LIKE ME CAME ALONG 
ANYWAY THAT'S WHERE HE IS I'M CERTAIN OF IT 
WHAT I MADE HIM DO HE'S MADE ME PAY FOR 
ALL MY SUCCESSES CHRIST 
NOTHING 
NOTHING AT ALL 
DO YOU HATE HIM NOW 
NO 
I DON'T KNOW WHY THOUGH 
THANK YOU AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN PLEASE BUT VERY QUIETLY 
SORRY ABOUT THE DISTURBANCE THERE'LL BE COFFEE AND SANDWICHES 
THERE'S ONE FAVOUR I'D LIKE FROM YOU MARY PLEASE 
YOU'LL FIND AN OLD GREEN FILING CABINET IN MY ROOM HERE 
IT'S JUST A LOT OF OLD NONSENSE THAT GOT BETWEEN MY FATHER AND ME FOR A TIME 
NO INTEREST TO ANYONE ELSE 
GET THEM TO MAKE A BONFIRE OF IT 
AND THEN THERE'S MY LETTER TO TOM 
LET HIM READ IT AS SOON AS YOU THINK THE TIME IS RIGHT 
OR AS RIGHT AS IT WILL EVER BE 
DON'T WAIT TOO LONG MARY 
HE'LL HAVE IT ROUGH I KNOW 
BUT I THINK HE MAY ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND BETTER WHILE HE'S YOUNG 
AS FOR US MARY 
NOT MUCH I CAN SAY EXCEPT I'M SORRY I MARRIED YOU FOR COVER 
BUT I'M GLAD WE MANAGED A BIT OF LOVE ALONG THE WAY 
THANK YOU FOR THAT 
HE'S WELL LIKED IN THE COMMUNITY HE'S ALWAYS WELL LIKED 
IT'S MUCH WARMER IN THE CHURCH HALL MADAM SHE'S BEST HERE 
IT COULD BE ALL NIGHT MADAM IF OUR FRIEND DECIDES TO STICK IT OUT 
TO BE TRUTHFUL IF WE HAVE TO GO IN SHE'LL HAVE TO WITHDRAW
