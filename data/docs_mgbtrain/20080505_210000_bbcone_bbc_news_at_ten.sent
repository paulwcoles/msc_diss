DEAD IN BURMA'S TROPICAL CYCLONE A 
HUGE RELIEF EFFORT HAS BEGUN THE 
UNITED NATIONS SAYS HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS ARE WITHOUT FOOD AND 
SHELTER 
A CRACKDOWN ON EMPLOYERS OF ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED BRITISH 
COMPANIES FACE PROSECUTION MEDALS 
FOR PRINCE HARRY AND THE HOUSEHOLD 
CAVALRY FOR THEIR SERVICE IN 
AFGHANISTAN AND CHELSEA WIN AT 
NEWCASTLE THE PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE 
WILL GO RIGHT TO THE WIRE 
GOOD EVENING THE TRUE SCALE OF THE 
CYCLONE IS DISASTER IN BURMA IS 
EMERGING THE DEATH TOLL IS RISING 
SHARPLY AND THE MILITARY RULERS 
HAVE APPEALED FOR INTERNATIONAL AID 
THE CYCLONE SWEPT ACROSS BURMA TWO 
DAYS AGO WITH ONE TWENTY M. P. H. WINDS BURMA'S 
GOVERNMENT NOW SAYS AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND 
PEOPLE ARE FEARED TO HAVE DIED AND 
THREE THOUSAND ARE CONFIRMED MISSING BUT 
THERE ARE FEARS THAT MANY MORE MAY 
HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN REMOTE 
AREAS THE UNITED NATIONS SAYS MUCH 
OF THE POPULATION IS WITHOUT 
SHELTER OR DRINKING WATER 
JOURNALISTS ARE BEING STOPPED FROM 
ENTERING THE COUNTRY ANDREW 
HARDING SENT US THIS REPORT FROM 
NEIGHBOURING THAILAND THE SCALE OF 
THIS DISASTER IS FINALLY EMERGING 
TEN THOUSAND DEAD AND THOUSANDS MORE 
MISSING FOR THREE AGONISING DAYS 
MANY OF THE WORST AFFECTED AREAS 
HAVE BEEN CUT OFF THE SURVIVORS 
WRESTLING ALONE WITH THE AFTERMATH 
BUT SLOWLY AS ROADS ARE CLEARED 
NEWS IS PER CENT NEWS IS TRICKLING 
OUT AND IT IS 
UNIFORMALLY GRIM THE STORMS 
SMASHED IN FROM THE SEA WIPING OUT 
WHOLE VILLAGES LEAVING HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS ONE 
EYEWITNESS RECORDED THE DEVASTATION 
AROUND THE CITY OF RANGOON MASSIVE MASSIVE DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY THE CYCLONE 
WAS EVIDENT THE MOMENT WE REACHED 
THE OUTSKIRTS OF RANGOON THERE WAS 
FLOODWATER AND INSIDE THE CITY 
THERE WERE MASSIVE TREES HAD BEEN 
UPROOTED FROM THE GROUND ALONG 
WITH ELECTRICITY AND TELEPHONE 
CABLES 
THIS WOULD BE A HEAVY BLOW CABLES FOR MANY COUNTRY IN BURMA THE 
POPULATION HAS ALREADY BEEN WORN 
DOWN BY DECADES OF BRUTAL MILITARY 
RULE THE GOVERNMENT IS DEEPLY 
SUSPICIOUS OF FOREIGN AID 
ORGANISATIONS BUT IT HAS NOW 
AGREED TO LET SOME SUPPLIES IN THE THE UNITED NATIONS WILL DO WHATEVER ALL 
TO PROVIDE URGENT HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF THE THE LACK 
OF COMMUNICATIONS AND THE 
INFORMATIONS WE ARE NOT QUITE SURE 
WHAT WOULD BE THE TOTE A EXTENT OF 
DAMAGES AND THE CASUALTIES BUT I 
AM ALARMED BY THE INCOMING NEWS 
THAT THE CASUALTIES HAVE RISEN MORE 
THAN TEN THOUSAND TOTAL 
MANY PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN WITHOUT APPRECIATE WATER 
FOR DAYS TENTS PLASTIC SHEETING 
WATER AND FOOD ARE NEEDED FAST AND 
IN HUGE QUANTITIES FOR BURMA'S 
RULERS THIS IS A BIG TEST AT AN 
AWKWARD TIME THE MILITARY SAY THEY 
STILL PLAN TO GO AHEAD WITH A 
NATIONAL REFERENDUM A STEP THE 
GENERALS CLAIM TO DEMOCRACY BUT 
RIGHT NOW THE COUNTRY HAS OTHER 
PRIORITIES A LITTLE EARLIER I 
ASKED ANDREW HOW HARD IT IS TO 
ASSESS THE SCALE THF DISASTER BEN BEN BURMA IS A DIFFICULT COUNTRY TO 
FIND OUT ANYTHING ABOUT AT THE BEST 
OF TIMES BUT THINGS ARE CLEARER 
TONIGHT WE ARE HEARING FOR 
INSTANCE REPORTS FROM THE COASTLINE 
WHERE SOME VILLAGES ARE STILL UNDER 
TWELVE FEET OF WATER OTHERS HAVE BEEN 
BURIED BY SAND WE ARE HEARING 
ABOUT VILLAGES WHERE NINE OUT OF 
TEN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE 
CAPITAL SOME REPORTS SUGGESTING 
THAT CHAOS AT THE MAIN JAIL THERE 
LED GUARDS TO KILL MORE THAN THIRTY 
PRISONERS 
ANDREW IT'S NOT AN EASY PRISONERS PLACE TO DELIVER THE AID THAT IS SO 
DESPERATELY NEEDED 
IT'S NOT THE 
GOOD NEWS IS THAT THAILAND AND 
INDIA TWO CLOSEST COUNTRIES ARE 
SENDING PLANES IN TOMORROW L. THINK 
THE PROBLEM IS GOING TO BE IN THE 
MEDIUM TERM AS MORE AND MORE AID 
COMES IN WILL THIS SECRETIVE 
GOVERNMENT IN BURMA ALLOW THE 
UNITED NATIONS TO TAKE THE CO 
ORDINATING ROLE THAT REALLY IT 
NEEDS TO DO TO MAKE SURE THE AID 
GETS TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE FAST 
ENOUGH ENOUGH HERE THERE HAS BEEN DRAMATIC 
INCREASE IN THE NUMBERS OF 
EMPLOYERS BEING PROSECUTED FOR 
HIRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THE B. B. C. 
HAS OBTAINED FIGURES WHICH SHOW 
THAT SINCE THE LAW CHANGED TWO 
MONTHS AGO CHARGES HAVE BEEN 
BROUGHT AGAINST MORE THAN ONE HOW 
COUNTRIES ONE HUNDRED AROUND SIXTY 
IMMIGRATION OFFICERS POUR INTO A 
WE'RE HOUSE PROCESSING CHICKEN IN 
DERBYSHIRE 
CAN YOU ALL STAND STILL DERBYSHIRE CAN YOU PUT YOUR KNIVES DOWN THE THE WORKERS ARE CAUGHT UNAWARES FIFTY SIX ARE 
LINED UP 
WE ARE HERE TO SEE IF 
ANYBODY IS HERE WORKING ILLEGALLY 
TWENTY TWO OF THE MEN WERE HERE ILLEGALLY 
BUT REALLY IT'S THE EMPLOYERS THE 
AUTHORITIES ARE GOING AFTER HERE 
OFFICERS ARE YET TO DECIDE IF THE 
COMPANY OWNERS HAVE DONE ANYTHING 
WRONG EVEN LARGE SCALE OPERATIONS 
LIKE THIS WILL ONLY MAKE THE 
TINIEST DIFFERENCE TO THE HUGE 
NUMBERS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN 
THIS COUNTRY THE IDEA IS TO GO 
AFTER THE EMPLOYERS IN THE HOPE 
THAT MAKES DIFFERENCE ALL THESE 
PEOPLE ARE HERE TO WORK AND TO STOP 
THE WORK YOU REMOVE THE PULL FACTOR 
DRIVING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BUT 
SOME EMPLOYERS BELIEVE THEY'VE BEEN 
TREATED UNFAIRLY THIS MAN WAS 
RECENTLY FINED SIX THOUSAND FOR HIRING 
FOUR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AT ANOTHER 
OF HIS RESTAURANTS 
IF ANYONE 
COMING WITH A BRITISH PASSPORT HOW 
DO I KNOW THIS IS FAKE BRITISH 
PASSPORT I HAVEN'T GOT ANY MACHINE 
OR ANYTHING 
HOW BIG IS THE 
PROBLEM THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES 
THERE ARE UP TO FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS IN THE COUNTRY THOUGH 
THERE COULD BE MANY MORE IN THE 
LAST TWO MONTHS ONE THIRTY SEVEN EMPLOYERS HAVE 
BEEN PROSECUTED THAT IS DOUBLE IN 
THE PREVIOUS DECADE 
I THINK IT'S 
LONG OVERDUE THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS GOT SERIOUS ABOUT PROSECUTING 
EMPLOYERS FRANKLY IT'S BEEN A 
SCANDAL THAT IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE 
HAVE HAD SO FEW PROSECUTIONS ONLY 
THIRTY FOUR IN TWO PREVIOUS YEARS TWENTY 
CONVICTIONS 
ANOTHER PROBLEM CONVICTIONS DEPORTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IS A 
SLOW AND COSTLY BUSINESS THE BILL 
COULD SPIRAL TO FIVE BILLION IF MOST 
OF THOSE ALREADY HERE WERE CAUGHT 
WE WILL HAVE TO SPEND MORE ON 
DEPORTING PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE WE 
DEPORTED SIXTY THOUSAND LAST YEAR L. WANT 
TO SEE THE NUMBER GOING UP WE NEED 
TO DOUBLE THE BUDGET FOR THE 
ENFORCEMENT TEAMS 
ONLY TWO 
ARRESTED WERE DEPORTING IMMEDIATELY 
THE REST SIMPLY ADD TO THE GROWING 
NUMBERS NUMBERS THE MOTHER OF TWO BOYS WHO WERE 
FOUND DEAD IN A CAR AT A BEAUTY 
SPOT HAS PAID TRIB TUET HER SONS 
GISELLE ROSS SAID THEY WERE 
IRREPLACEABLE AND LOVED BY ALL WHO 
LOVED THEM THE BODIES OF SIX YEAR 
OLD PAUL ROSS AND HIS TWO YEAR OLD

POLICE SAY JOSEF FRITZL LODGED A 
PLANNING REQUEST FOR AN EXTENSION 
TKPH NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHEN ELISABETH WAS 
AROUND TWO YEARS OLD IN SEVERAL 
YEARS LATER THE CELLAR BECAME HER 
PRISON 
WE NEED NOT 
ONLY GOT BACK TO NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WE HAVE TO 
GO BACK BEFORE THAT WHEN HE BUILT 
A BUILDING AND WHEN THE LOGIC SAYS 
HE MUST HAVE ALREADY HAD THE IDEA 
OR THE OBSESSION OF BUILDING THIS 
DUNGEON OF BUILDING THESE HIDDEN 
ROOMS TO EQUIP THEM LATER AND THEN 
TO KEEP HIS DAUGHTER IMPRISONED 
THE CASE WAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT WITH 
ELISABETH'S ELDEST DAUGHTER WAS

CONDITION IS SAID TO HAVE 
STABILISED THE REST OF THE FAMILY

CLINIC AND SLOWLY GETTING USED TO 
LIVING TOGETHER ABOVE GROUND 
THE FIVE YEAR OLD BOY IS GETTING MORE AND MORE LIVELY HE 
IS FASCINATED BY CONTACT AND 
FASCINATED BY JOKES AND HUMOUR AND 
WE CAN SEE FROM ALL MEMBERS OF THE 
FAMILY WHO WERE IN THE DUNGEON HOW 
THE BALANCED FOOD AND THE FRESH AIR 
AND HOW LIGHT IMPROVES THEIR STATE 
OF HEALTH 
PEOPLE HERE ARE TRYING 
TO CARRY ON AS NORMAL BUT THIS IS A 
HAUNTED TOWN THE FRITZL CASE WON'T 
BE FORGOTTEN EASILY
