HA WAY NINNIES LOOSEN YER GALLUSES 
MAKE YERSELVES COMFORTABLE IN YOUR ARMCHAIRS 
AND LISTEN TO SONGS OF PRAISE FROM NORTHUMBERLAND WHAT ABOOT THAT 
FANTASTIC HE'S SAID IT ALL HASN'T HE 
NORTHUMBERLAND'S HISTORY AND CUSTOMS ARE IN THE SPOTLIGHT THIS WEEK 
WE MEET THE FAMILY WHO ARE FARMING IN A TRADITIONAL WAY 
I GET TO PLAY THE NORTHUMBRIAN PIPES 
AND BARBARA DICKSON PERFORMS ONE OF HER FAVOURITE HYMNS ON HOLY ISLAND 
NORTHUMBERLAND CAN BOAST SOME BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES 
FROM THE RUGGED APPEAL OF THE NATIONAL PARK 
TO THE MAJESTIC HOLY ISLAND OF LINDISFARNE 
FROM WHERE SAINT AIDAN SET ABOUT SPREADING THE CHRISTIAN GOSPEL IN THE SEVENTH CE NT U. RY 
AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER REMINDERS OF ITS COLOURFUL HISTORY 
LIKE THIS HADRIAN'S WALL SOME SEVENTY THREE MILES LONG 
IT WAS BUILT IN THE FIRST CENTURY BY THE ROMANS 
AS A MEANS OF DEFENDING THE EMPIRE 
NOWADAYS IT'S INVADED BY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF VISITORS EVERY YEAR 
KEEN TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ITS HISTORY 
AND EXPERIENCE BEAUTIFUL SURROUNDINGS 
OUR HYMNS THIS EVENING COME FROM HEXHAM ABBEY 
A SHORT DISTANCE FROM HERE 
AND WE BEGIN WITH ALL CREATURES OF OUR GOD AND KING 
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT NORTHUMBERLAND'S CULTURAL PAST 
COME TO THE MORPETH GATHERING 
A LIVELY THREE DAY ARTS FESTIVAL WHICH STARTED OVER FORTY YEARS AGO 
I GREW UP WITH THE CELEBRATION OF NORTHUMBERLAND 
THAT BEGAN AS A MUSIC FESTIVAL 
BUT ENCOMPASSES THE DIALECT AND THE CRAFT 
AND THE GENERAL CULTURE DANCE AND HISTORY 
EASY ISN'T IT 
WE HAVE LIVE PERFORMANCE FOR SINGING MUSIC AND CLOG DANCE 
WE HAVE CRAFT SKILLS ON DISPLAY IN THE EXHIBITION WITHIN THE TOWN HALL 
IT'S LIKE A VILLAGE SHOW BUT IN AN URBAN SETTING 
THIS IS A LOCAL COSTUME OH IS IT YES IT'S CALLED A BONDAGER 
BONDAGER NO SNIGGERING 
WE'VE GOT SO MANY BRITISH TRADITIONS THAT DON'T SEEM TO BE IMPORTANT 
THEY REALLY ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE PART OF OUR IDENTITY 
AND PART OF OUR CULTURE 
YOU CAN SEE NOW WE'VE BEEN GOING FOR FORTY ONE YEARS SORT OF MAN AND BOY 
YOU CAN SEE THE NEXT GENERATIONS COMING ALONG 
AND EVOLVING THE CRAFTS FOR THEMSELVES 
OR THE MUSIC OR WHATEVER IT IS 
LEADING THE GATHERING'S PROCESSION IS LOCAL MINISTER RON FORSTER 
IT'S SO EASY TO SAY THAT WE'RE ALL THE SAME 
BUT TO SPEND TIME IN AN AREA AND DISCOVER WHAT'S UNIQUE 
AND WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT THAT AREA IS SO IMPORTANT 
AND TO SHARE THAT WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO BE BORN AND BRED IN NORTHUMBERLAND 
TO BE NORTHUMBRIAN I HOPE THAT WE'RE WELCOMING 
ANYBODY CAN COME IN AND BE AN ADOPTED NORTHUMBRIAN 
THIS YEAR WE'RE HAVING THE GATHERING SERVICE 
IN SAINT GEORGE'S CHURCH 
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE BAPTISING AIDAN 
WHO IS A THIRD GENERATION NORTHUMBRIAN 
IN THE BAPTISM SERVICE I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING 
WHICH SPOKE QUITE CLEARLY OF GOD'S CARE 
AND GOD'S LOVE FOR EACH ONE OF US 
AND I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT IT 
AND WHEN I WAS DRIVING IN THE NORTHUMBRIAN HILLS IT CAME TO ME 
WHY NOT WRAP THE BABY IN CLOTH 
AND WHAT BETTER CLOTH THAN THE SHEPHERD'S PLAID 
I BAPTISE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER 
THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT AMEN 
WHICH IS A SYMBOL OF NORTHUMBERLAND 
AND WHICH FOR ME IS ALSO A SYMBOL OF GOD'S LOVE AND CARE 
NORTHUMBERLAND HAS WELCOMED PILGRIMS FOR GENERATIONS 
AND EVERY YEAR A GROUP OF CHRISTIANS FOLLOWING IN THAT TRADITION 
TAKE PART IN A WEEK LONG WALK TO A REMOTE TIDAL ISLAND 
JUST OFF THE COAST 
IT FEELS VERY MUCH LIKE CANTERBURY TALES DOESN'T IT 
A GROUP OF PEOPLE GETTING TOGETHER AND WALKING ALONG THE ROAD 
AND TELLING EACH OTHER STORIES AND GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER 
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE IS AN AIM THAT YOU'RE GOING TO 
IN CHAUCER'S CASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
TO SEE SAINT THOMAS BECKET'S GRAVE IN CANTERBURY 
IN OURS IT'S TO GET TO HOLY ISLAND 
HOLY ISLAND IS VERY SPECIALLY LINKED WITH SAINT CUTHBERT WHO LIVED THERE 
AND DIED THERE 
WE FIND HOLY ISLAND A VERY SPECIAL PLACE TO END OUR PILGRIMAGE 
WE CARRY THIS PIECE OF WOOD THIS LARGE PIECE OF WOOD 
FROM CARLISLE TO SHOW THE WORLD TO MAKE A STATEMENT AS WE CARRY IT 
AND REMEMBER WHAT CHRIST SUFFERED DURING HOLY WEEK 
SOME MIGHT SAY YOU KNOW IT'S JUST AN ISLAND 
SAINT CUTHBERT JUST ANOTHER SAINT 
WHY SHOULD PEOPLE BE MAKING THAT PILGRIMAGE 
WE NEED TO GO BACK TO SIMPLICITY 
AND SAINT CUTHBERT REMINDS US OF THE SIMPLE AND IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE 
WE ARE TOTALLY AT THE MERCY OF NATURE AND THE COUNTRYSIDE 
IT REMINDS US OF WHERE WE'RE ALL COMING FROM 
IT'S STILL TERRIBLY RELEVANT 
IT ANSWERS OUR NEEDS NOW JUST AS MUCH AS IT DID ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
AND INDEED 
WE CAN DO WITH GETTING AWAY FOR A WEEK DOING A MUCH SIMPLER ENDEAVOUR 
IT'S WE NEED IT FOR OUR SANITY I THINK 
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE PILGRIMAGE 
DO YOU FEEL THAT YOUR FAITH IS RENEWED IN A WAY 
UNDOUBTEDLY AND I MEAN THAT IN A VERY SIMPLISTIC WAY 
AND THERE BE NO PERJURY IN HIS MOUTH 
MY RELIGION ISN'T ANY DIFFERENT TO ANYONE ELSE'S 
I'M JUST A NORMAL HUMAN BEING 
I JUST FEEL TOTALLY RENEWED AND VERY MUCH AWARE OF GOD 
IN THE PEOPLE I'VE WALKED WITH AND IN THE COUNTRYSIDE I'VE EXPERIENCED 
NORTHUMBERLAND IS KNOWN FOR ITS DISTINCTIVE STYLE OF FOLK MUSIC 
ARE HELPING TO KEEP THAT TRADITION ALIVE 
CAN I COME AND JOIN YOU YEAH 
LET ME ASK YOU ERM 
WHAT DO YOU GET OUT OF PLAYING TOGETHER 
OH IT'S A FEELING OF COMPANIONSHIP AND 
COS IT IS ABOUT THE MUSIC AND IT IS FUN 
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT BEING FRIENDS TOGETHER AND PLAYING TOGETHER 
IT SEEMS THERE ARE LOTS OF SMILES GOING ON BETWEEN YOU ALL 
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING 
YOU'RE ALL WATCHING ONE ANOTHER AND SMILING AWAY 
DO YOU ALL FEEL THAT SORT OF COMPANIONSHIP OH YES YES 
WHILE WE'RE PLAYING IT'S A FEELING OF TERROR MOST OF THE TIME 
ESPECIALLY IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE 
IT IS AND THIS GROUP GOES BACK A LONG TIME 
AND APPARENTLY THIS IS WHAT CREATES THAT UNIQUE SOUND 
IT'S ERM OH 
THE NORTHUMBRIAN SMALL PIPE RIGHT 
IT'S LIKE A BAGPIPE THAT'S UNIQUE TO THIS PART OF THE WORLD 
O. K. I'M BLOWN UP WHAT DO I DO NOW PRESS REALLY HARD WITH THAT ARM 
PIPES WAIL 
I'M A NATURAL 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST MUSIC THAT KEEPS THE GROUP TOGETHER 
THEY ALSO PERFORM TO RAISE MONEY FOR CHARITY 
AND DONATE ALL OF THEIR PROCEEDS TO A LOCAL HOSPICE 
THE HOSPICE MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN LOTS OF WAYS 
IT KEEPS US TOGETHER AND KEEPS US GOING 
AND WANTING TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS 
BUT YES IT DOES BRING MORE MONEY IN THERE'S NO DOUBT 
THERE ARE TIMES ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS WE'VE BEEN TO EVENTS 
AND SOMEBODY'S HANDED OVER A THOUSAND POUND CHEQUE NOW 
I DON'T THINK OUR MUSIC WAS THAT GOOD 
SO CLEARLY THAT'S BEEN THE HOSPICE AND IT MAKES AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE 
SO IT ENTHUSES EVERYBODY 
PIPES PLAY 
THE INSPIRATION BEHIND ROBSON'S CHOICE IS THEIR FORMER TUTOR 
JANE ROBSON WHO DIED FROM CANCER SEVEN YEARS AGO 
JANE WAS IN HERE WHEN SHE WAS ILL SHE TAUGHT MOST OF US TO PLAY 
WELL ALL OF US HERE IN FACT 
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME VISITING AND BUILT UP A RAPPORT 
WITH THE PEOPLE WORKING HERE 
IT'S GOOD TO BE ABLE TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK FOR THEIR HOSPITALITY 
AND FOR THE WELCOME THAT WE GET HERE 
SHE WAS A PRETTY SPECIAL LADY YOUR TEACHER WASN'T SHE SHE WAS 
SHE WAS VERY ENCOURAGING TO US ALL 
AND SOMEHOW SHE MADE US FEEL VALUED AND THAT WE COULD PLAY THE PIPES 
SHE WOULD REALLY GO THE EXTRA MILE FOR US 
AS IN ALL TRADITIONAL MUSIC YOU NEED SOMEONE TO MAYBE SPUR PEOPLE ON 
AND WE ALL GO OUT AND PLAY IN DIFFERENT VENUES 
AND IN THE BACK OF OUR MINDS IT'S ALWAYS WE KNOW WHERE WE LEARNT IT 
AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT 
ALTHOUGH SHE LIVES ON WITHIN THIS GROUP AND WIDER TOO 
WE KNOW THAT WE WILL SEE HER AGAIN WHEN WE PASS INTO THE NEXT LIFE 
AS IT WERE AND I TRULY THINK SHE BELIEVED THAT 
SHE HAD A GREAT FAITH THAT CARRIED HER THROUGH 
BE STILL MY SOUL 
THE LORD IS ON THY SIDE 
BEAR PATIENTLY THE CROSS OF GRIEF OR PAIN 
LEAVE TO THY GOD TO ORDER AND PROVIDE 
IN EVERY CHANGE 
HE FAITHFUL WILL REMAIN 
BE STILL MY SOUL 
THY BEST THY HEAVENLY FRIEND 
THROUGH THORNY WAYS 
LEADS TO A JOYFUL END 
BE STILL MY SOUL 
THOUGH DEAREST FRIENDS DEPART 
AND ALL IS DARKENED 
IN THE VALE OF TEARS 
THEN SHALT THOU BETTER KNOW HIS LOVE HIS HEART 
WHO COMES TO SOOTHE THY SORROWS AND THY FEARS 
BE STILL MY SOUL 
THE WAVES AND WINDS STILL KNOW 
HIS VOICE WHO RULED THEM WHILE HE DWELT BELOW 
BE STILL MY SOUL 
THE HOUR IS HASTENING ON 
WHEN WE SHALL BE 
FOREVER WITH THE LORD 
WHEN DISAPPOINTMENT GRIEF AND FEAR ARE GONE 
SORROW FORGOT LOVE'S PUREST JOYS RESTORED 
BE STILL MY SOUL 
WHEN CHANGE AND TEARS ARE PAST 
ALL SAFE AND BLESSED 
WE SHALL MEET AT LAST 
ALL SAFE AND BLESSED 
WE SHALL MEET AT LAST 
BE STILL 
ORIGINALLY THE WHOLE OF NORTHUMBERLAND WAS WOODLAND 
AND THE FACT THAT MOST OF IT HAS DISAPPEARED IS EVIDENCE 
THAT THE LAND HAS SUPPORTED PEOPLE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
WELL WE CAN'T GO BACK THAT FAR BUT I'M ABOUT TO MEET A FAMILY 
JUST DOWN THERE WHO HAVE BEEN FARMING HERE FOR FIVE GENERATIONS 
I THINK WE'RE VERY LUCKY TO LIVE HERE AND I THINK MY FAMILY FEEL THE SAME 
IT'S NOT AN EASY LIFE BUT WE DO FEEL FORTUNATE THAT WE LIVE 
IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PART OF THE WORLD 
THAT IS QUITE UNSPOILT REALLY 
AND FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS REALLY YOU CAN LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW 
AND IT HASN'T CHANGED VERY MUCH FROM MY GREAT GRANDFATHER'S TIME 
STILL THE SAME ANIMALS SAME KIND OF CROPS 
IT'S REALLY TRADITIONAL FARMING 
LOOKING AFTER THE DRY STONE WALLS THE PEAT BOGS 
THAT ARE THERE TO HELP TO NEUTRALISE THE CARBON IN THE ATMOSPHERE 
DO YOU FEEL A CONNECTION WITH GOD AND GOD'S CREATION IN A WAY 
YES WITH FARMERS THERE IS THIS INNATE CLOSENESS TO GOD 
WHO PROVIDES EVERYTHING FOR THE ANIMALS AND THE LAND TO PROSPER 
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS 
WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME MASSIVE PROBLEMS 
FIRST OF ALL WELL I LOST MY HUSBAND AND THEN FOOT AND MOUTH 
YOU DO NEED TO HAVE AN INNER STRENGTH THAT I THINK HILL FARMERS DO HAVE 
BUT I HAVE MANAGED TO PERHAPS GAIN MORE STRENGTH 
THROUGH THE FAITH THAT I HAVE IN GOD THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD 
WERE THERE TIMES WHEN YOU DID QUESTION YOUR FAITH 
WHEN FOOT AND MOUTH CAME 
BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE TO GO THROUGH 
I LOOKED OUTSIDE AND LOOKED DOWN THE VALLEY AND THOUGHT 
WELL LET'S HOPE THERE'S SOMETHING BETTER COMING 
AND I THINK HE SENT THAT TO US TO MAKE US STRONGER REALLY 
WE HAVE DIVERSIFIED YOU SEE AND YOU HAD TO DO THAT 
BUT NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO DO BED AND BREAKFAST AND HAVE VISITORS 
AND NOW WE HAVE THE SCHOOLS COMING ON TO THE FARM 
AND THEY GROW FROM A BULB DON'T THEY 
WE'VE ENJOYED HAVING QUITE A FEW SCHOOL VISITS 
AND IT'S BEEN VERY REWARDING IT HAS 
WE'VE BEEN INVITED TO ANOTHER FARM NEXT DOOR 
A GOOD FARMER HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR HIS LAND 
BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY A SPECK IN THE WORLD AT THIS TIME 
AND WE'RE HERE TO PASS THE LAND ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION 
AND WE TRY TO PASS IT ON IN A GOOD SHAPE 
AS WE RECEIVED IT OR EVEN BETTER 
OUR FATHER GOD YOU ENCIRCLE US WITH YOUR GREAT LOVE 
THROUGH JESUS OUR FRIEND AND MASTER 
THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR GOODNESS TO US 
THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTY IN WHICH WE LIVE 
THE DELIGHTS OF MUSIC MAKING AND TALKING WITH FRIENDS 
AS MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY ON EARTH KEEP US EVER CLOSE TO YOU 
MAY WE GROW IN THE HOLY SPIRIT TODAY TOMORROW AND ALWAYS 
AMEN 
I'VE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IMMERSING MYSELF 
IN SOME OF THE FASCINATING CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS THAT ARE STILL ALIVE 
IN THIS BEAUTIFUL PART OF THE WORLD 
BUT THAT'S ALMOST IT FOR THIS WEEK I LEAVE YOU WITH OUR FINAL HYMN
