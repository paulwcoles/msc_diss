TODAY WE'RE IN PARR HALL IN WARRINGTON 
A PLACE STEEPED IN HISTORY 
IT WAS ONCE A COURTHOUSE PLAYING HOST TO MANY AN UNSAVOURY CHARACTER 
TODAY IT'S A STATE OF THE ART CENTRE FOR THE ARTS 
AND IT'S PLAYING HOST TO FLOG IT 
AND OUR SAVOURY CHARACTERS TODAY ARE OUR EXPERTS CHARLIE ROSS AND NIGEL SMITH 
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LET'S SEE WHICH ANTIQUES THEY WISH 
TO STEAL AWAY AND MAKE A STASH OF CASH FOR OUR OWNERS 
MERHABA MERHABA 
DID I GET THAT RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT 
AND YOU ARE FROM WHERE I'M FROM TURKEY 
SO YOU'RE ALL THE WAY HERE IN WARRINGTON FROM TURKEY 
WHY HAVE YOU COME TO FLOG IT TODAY 
I WORK FOR SAINT ANNE'S HOSPICE AS A SHOP MANAGER 
AND THIS ITEM HAS BEEN DONATED TO THE HOSPICE 
IT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION AND I WANTED TO BRING IT HERE 
AND YOU THOUGHT BLIMEY THIS IS TOO GOOD TO PUT IN THE WINDOW 
WE'D BETTER TAKE IT ALONG AND GET A VALUATION ON IT EXACTLY 
WHAT IS IT YOU'VE BOUGHT ALONG 
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A THREE DIAMOND BROOCH 
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE DIAMONDS I HAVE NO IDEA 
YOU HOPE THEY ARE I HOPE SO 
AND IT ARRIVED IN THIS BOX DID IT 
IT DIDN'T COME WITH THE BOX 
I PUT IT IN THE BOX 
YOU'VE DRESSED IT UP ESPECIALLY FOR TODAY HAVE YOU 
THAT'S RIGHT LET'S TAKE IT OUT OF THE BOX AND HAVE A LOOK 
YES IT IS A BROOCH 
IT WASN'T A BROOCH ORIGINALLY 
O. K. THESE ARE BUTTONS 
BUT THEY'RE BEAUTIFULLY MODELLED 
AND THEY HAVE GOT BLUE ENAMEL BACKGROUNDS TO THEM 
AND SMALL DIAMOND CHIPS AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE CENTRAL DIAMONDS 
WHICH ARE PROBABLY OH TWO TO ZERO POINT THREE OF A CARAT EACH 
SO YES THEY'RE REAL DIAMONDS 
YES IT'S A PRETTY BROOCH 
I THINK YOU'VE DONE THE RIGHT THING BY BRINGING IT ALONG TO FLOG IT 
THE ONLY THING IS WE NEED TO ASCERTAIN SOME SORT OF VALUE 
ANY IDEAS 
I JUST PRESUMED IT LOOKS VERY OLD 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S WORTH 
I DON'T KNOW ITS HISTORY 
SO I'M JUST HOPING THAT IT WILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE HOSPICE 
I THINK IT'S MID NINETEENTH CENTURY SO IT'S MAYBE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OLD 
WHEN IT WAS MADE INTO A BROOCH IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL 
I SUSPECT SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME AGO 
I THINK THE VALUE SHOULD BE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED WOW 
WHICH IS BETTER THAN PUTTING IT IN THE WINDOW WITH A FIVER ON IT 
BEARING IN MIND THAT IT'S BEEN DONATED TO THE HOSPICE 
WHEN IT'S UP FOR AUCTION 
WE SHOULD PROTECT IT WITH A RESERVE PRICE 
BUT NOT TOO HIGH WE DON'T WANT TO PUT PEOPLE OFF 
MY VIEW WOULD BE FOR AN AUCTIONEER 
TO PUT AN ESTIMATE OF TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED ON IT WITH A RESERVE OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
O. K. I'M JUST HOPING THAT IT WILL GO TO SOMEONE 
WHO LOVES THE ITEM 
I THINK SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY PLEASURE 
PETER THANKS FOR BRINGING THESE TWO GEORGE BEST ANNUALS ALONG 
BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THESE 
YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING NICE WITH THE MONEY 
I'D LIKE TO DONATE THE PROCEEDS TO CHARITY 
LOVELY WHILE GEORGE SADLY PASSED AWAY A FEW MONTHS AGO 
I THOUGHT IF IT HELPED ANYONE ELSE WHO WAS IN THE SAME SITUATION 
THAT'S A LOVELY IDEA THESE YOU HAD WHEN YOU WERE A LAD IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT TO SIXTY NINE 
I'M A MANCHESTER LAD YOU KNOW 
YEAH ME AND MY BROTHER USED TO WATCH GEORGE BEST ON THE BLACK AND WHITE TELLY 
AND OLD TRAFFORD AND OLD TRAFFORD YEAH 
THE NICE THING ABOUT THESE IS THAT YOU GOT GEORGE TO SIGN THEM 
NOW THESE ARE NOT AS OLD AS NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND SIXTY NINE ARE THEY THE SIGNATURES 
NO TELL ME HOW YOU GOT THEM SIGNED 
GEORGE SIGNED THEM IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AT A SPORTSMEN'S DINNER RIGHT 
HE WAS SO COURTEOUS I JUST ASKED HIM HIM IF HE'D SIGN THEM 
AND HE SIGNED THEM STRAIGHT TO ME 
REALLY NICE GUY SO EASY 
SO EASY TO TALK TO 
AND HE SIGNED THEM BEST WISHES TO PETE GEORGE BEST 
YEAH MARVELLOUS IT WAS LOVELY TO MEET HIM 
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE FOOTBALL COLLECTING FRATERNITY 
THAT'LL WANT GEORGE BEST'S SIGNATURE 
AND I THINK THAT MAKES THESE SPECIAL 
THE BOOKS THEMSELVES ARE NOT PARTICULARLY RARE OR WONDERFUL NO 
THESE ARE FANTASTIC PHOTOGRAPHS AS WELL OF GEORGE IN FULL FLOW 
DON'T THINK THEY'RE WORTH A FORTUNE BUT THEY'RE RATHER NICE 
THE FACT GEORGE BEST'S SIGNED THEM MAKES THEM INTERESTING 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT AN IDEA OF VALUE 
BUT I THINK THESE ARE GONNA BE WORTH AROUND ABOUT FIFTY TO SIXTY 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I DIDN'T THINK THEY'D BE THAT MUCH 
THEY'RE GONNA MAKE THAT AND MORE PROBABLY YEAH FOR THE TWO THAT'D BE GREAT 
AND YOU'RE HAPPY TO GO IN AND GET WHAT WE CAN FOR THEM 
WELL THE MONEY CAN GO TO THE CHARITY AND HELP SOMEONE ELSE 
GREAT THAT'S A REALLY NICE IDEA 
WE'LL GET AS MUCH AS WE CAN FOR YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
DENNIS I'VE GOT ONE QUESTION FOR YOU 
DOES IT WORK YES 
AND YOU'VE PLAYED WITH IT LOTS OF TIMES PRESUMABLY 
WELL THE SONS PLAYED WITH IT BUT I HAD A GO WITH IT 
DID YOU BUY IT ORIGINALLY FOR YOUR SON 
NO IT WAS IT WAS THE NEPHEW'S AND HE HAD IT ABOUT NINETEEN SIXTY 
DO YOU THINK THAT HE BOUGHT IT NEW 
HE BOUGHT IT NEW DEFINITELY MY SISTER BOUGHT IT I DO KNOW THAT 
I THINK LOOKING AT IT IT'S NINETEEN SIXTIES 
I'VE LOOKED AT THE FRONT IT'S MADE IN JAPAN 
HAVING SAID THAT IT'S WELL MADE IT'S TIN PLATE IT ISN'T PLASTIC 
IT'S A QUALITY TOY IT'S A HUGE SHAME THAT THE BOX ISN'T THERE I KNOW 
WELL WHEN THEY GAVE IT TO US 
THE BOX WAS NEARLY FALLING IN 
AND IN THEM DAYS NOBODY BOTHERED ABOUT THAT 
IT'S ONLY THAT YOU LEARN LATELY 
SO IMPORTANT IN THINGS LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE IT IS THE RARITY VALUE YOU KNOW 
THERE MIGHT BE A FEW THOUSAND OF THESE I DARE SAY THERE ARE FEW ABOUT WITH THEIR BOXES 
IT'S BEEN WELL KEPT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THE OLD BATTERIES 
I ALWAYS TAKE BATTERIES OUT OF ANYTHING IN CASE THE 
NUMBER ONE THING FOR PEOPLE TO REMEMBER 
I KNOW TAKE THE BATTERIES OUT OR THEY CORRODE 
THAT'S RIGHT AND THEY SPOIL THEM 
ABSOLUTELY YEAH WOULD YOU SET IT GOING FOR ME DENNIS 
I'M GONNA BE INTRIGUED DOES HE TALK 
NO HE DOESN'T TALK HE JUST WALKS 
WHAT A NOVEL WAY OF STARTING IT 
IT IS ISN'T IT IN WITH THE ANTENNAE AND OFF WE GO 
OH I THINK HE'S SPLENDID WHAT'S GOING IN THE FRONT THERE 
IT'S THE UNIVERSE GOING ROUND AND ROUND 
I MUST LOOK AT THAT CAN YOU TURN HIM ROUND SO HE CAN WALK TOWARDS ME 
I'LL PUT THE GLASSES ON OH HE'S TURNED 
STEADY 
OH I SAY THAT'S RATHER EXCITING 
STAR WARS 
OH I'VE SEEN MORE THAN ENOUGH OF THAT I THINK IT'S GREAT 
WHAT MADE YOU BRING HIM ALONG TODAY 
WELL I THOUGHT WITH IT BEING ONE OF THOSE IN THE SIXTIES AND THAT 
AND I'VE SEEN ON THE TELLY BEFORE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH 
AROUND ONE HUNDRED 
I THINK THAT THAT TOY WITH ITS BOX IS TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED 
I THINK WITHOUT ITS BOX IT'S BETWEEN ONE AND TWO 
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE SAFE AT YOUR ONE HUNDRED MARK 
YEAH I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT 
AND FRANKLY I THINK YOU KNOW IF WE PUT IT IN AT ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED RESERVE AT ONE HUNDRED PERHAPS 
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF DISCRETION 
MY VIEW IS IT'S NOT WORTH SELLING WITHOUT RESERVE 
BECAUSE IF IT ISN'T WORTH ONE HUNDRED NOW IT WILL BE IN FIVE YEARS' TIME 
BECAUSE THINGS LIKE THIS ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE COLLECTIBLE ESPECIALLY IN THIS CONDITION 
SO I THINK WE WILL BANG IT IN THE AUCTION ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED 
AND WITH A DECENT AUCTIONEER AND A DECENT BIDDER OR TWO 
I THINK IT WILL WALK ALONG NICELY 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA FIND AT ONE OF OUR VALUATION DAYS 
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT 
I'VE JUST HAD SOME MEMORIES OF MY SCHOOLBOY DAYS WHICH HAVE COME FLOODING BACK TO ME 
BECAUSE AS I USED TO WALK HOME FROM SCHOOL FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN YOU GET IN IS PUT THE TELLY ON 
I USED TO WATCH SOOTY AND SWEEP AND HERE THEY ARE 
LOOK AT THAT LOVELY GLOVE PUPPETS MADE BY CHAD VALLEY IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
SWEEP SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING HIMSELF 
BUT SOOTY HE'S TELLING ME ONE OF OUR EXPERTS HAS JUST FOUND SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING 
BRENDA NOW THERE ARE TEAPOTS AND THERE ARE TEAPOTS 
BUT THIS IS A SMASHING TEAPOT 
IT IS YES HOW DID YOU GET THIS 
IT'S HANDED DOWN FROM MY GREAT GREAT GRANDPARENTS 
SO IT'S AN INHERITANCE YES 
THE UNUSUAL THING ABOUT THIS IS MOST YOUNG SAILORS HAVE GOT TWO LEGS 
BUT HALF OF THEM ARE LEGLESS MOST OF THE TIME AREN'T THEY 
WE TURN HIM ROUND AND LOOK LO AND BEHOLD HE'S GOT A THIRD LEG 
THIS WAS MADE FOR A CHINA RETAILER IN DOUGLAS ISLE OF MAN 
HE'S A VERY COLLECTIBLE MODEL OF TEAPOT RIGHT 
HE WAS MADE PROBABLY IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTIES ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES I WOULD THINK 
IF WE TAKE HIS TOP OFF AND LOOK AT THE BOTTOM 
THAT WAS THE RETAILER REALLY 
THIS WAS I THINK WAS MADE IN STAFFORDSHIRE FOR THAT RETAILER WILLIAM BROUGHTON YES 
IT'S A WELL KNOWN MODEL AND TEAPOT COLLECTORS LIKE THE UNUSUAL 
THIS IS UNUSUAL ISN'T IT YES 
I'VE SOLD SEVERAL MODELS OF THIS IN THE PAST HAVE YOU YES 
IT'S MADE OF MAJOLICA WHICH IS AN ENGLISH TYPE OF POTTERY AND IT IS A LEAD GLAZED EARTHENWARE 
YES AND YOU GET THESE LOVELY SOFT COLOURED GLAZES 
AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS HE'S IN NICE CONDITION 
HE'S ALL THERE ISN'T HE YES NO CHIPS NO CHIPS YET NO 
WELL I THINK WE WOULD GO IN WITH AN ESTIMATE OF MAYBE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
RIGHT THAT'S AN ATTRACTIVE ESTIMATE 
I THINK WE'RE PLAYING IT SAFE WITH THAT 
I CAN SEE IT PIPPING THAT PRICE YES 
IT'S GOING IN A GOOD SALE MARSHALL'S OF KNUTSFORD DO WELL WITH CERAMICS 
WE'LL PUT A FIXED RESERVE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY O. K. 
DOESN'T MAKE THAT YOU DON'T WANNA SELL IT THAT'S FINE 
I THINK HE WILL GO ON A BIT YOU KNOW 
I THINK HE'LL SELL REALLY WELL WE'VE HAD GOOD MONEY FOR THIS MODEL BEFORE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IT'S A REAL MIXED BAG FOR OUR FIRST SET OF LOTS 
FROM FOOTY TO TEAPOTS AND DIAMONDS TO ROBOTS 
LET'S SEE HOW THEY ALL DO AT AUCTION 
WHICH TODAY IS AT FRANK MARSHALL AND CO IN KNUTSFORD 
AND THE AUCTIONEER IS OUR VERY OWN ADAM PARTRIDGE 
BRENDA'S NOVELTY ISLE OF MAN MAJOLICA TEAPOT 
NIGEL'S PUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED ON HIM 
WILL HE RUN AWAY WITH HIS THREE LEGS AT THAT FIGURE 
I THINK WE'LL BEAT THE ESTIMATE PROBABLY 
THE MAJOR WORD IS THE MAJOLICA ISN'T IT YEAH THAT'S WHERE THE COLLECTORS ARE 
MAJOLICA SUFFERS A LOT OF DAMAGE THIS IS IN GOOD CONDITION 
SUPERB FOR ITS AGE 
IT'S NOT MY PERSONAL TASTE BUT I CAN APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE IT'S QUIRKY 
IT'S A NOVELTY TEAPOT IT'S MAJOLICA IT'S GONNA DO WELL 
I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED SHALL WE SAY 
DO YOU THINK HE WILL DO THE FIVE IT'S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION 
AND I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT MY BIDS OR ANYTHING 
HAVE YOU SEEN ONE OF THESE IN YOUR SALE ROOM BEFORE

THIS COULD DO FIVE HUNDRED THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING FOR 
COULD DO COULD DO 
WE'LL SEE HOW THE THREE LEGGED TEAPOT DOES A BIT LATER 
BUT FIRST UP IT'S OUR TWO LEGGED ROBOT 
AT ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED I THINK THIS ROBOT'S CERTAINLY GONNA GO OUT OF ORBIT 
THAT'S FOR SURE 
THESE ARE SO COLLECTIBLE 
WE'VE SEEN IT ON TELLY BEFORE 
IF IT WAS A NINETEEN FIFTIES ONE YOU'RE LOOKING AT EIGHT ZERO ZERO ONE TWO ZERO ZERO 
I THINK WE'LL DO A BIT MORE THAN CHARLIE'S ESTIMATE 
IT'S IN GOOD CONDITION IT'S A BIT OF FUN 
I THINK ALL THE SCI FI AND ALL THE STAR TREKKIES WILL LOVE THIS 
IT'S A BOY'S TOY ISN'T IT 
AND IT WORKS WELL IT DOES 
BUT I'M NOT THE WORLD'S EXPERT ON JAPANESE TOYS 
SHAME IT'S BEEN HIDDEN AWAY FOR THIRTY ODD YEARS UP IN THE BACK ROOM BUT IT ISN'T A SHAME IS IT 
NO THAT'S A VIRTUE 
BECAUSE IF YOU'D BEEN PLAYING WITH IT IT WOULDN'T WORK ANY MORE NO

GOOD LUCK AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THANK YOU NIGEL YE OF LITTLE FAITH I HAD IT RIGHT ALL ALONG 
HE KNOWS HIS ONIONS DOESN'T HE 
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO THIS WHOLE AREA PULSED WITH THE HEARTBEAT 
OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WHICH WAS POUNDING AWAY AT FULL THROTTLE 
THE COAL THE CLAY AND THE SALT INDUSTRIES 
WERE THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE SOCIETIES WHICH LIVED AROUND HERE 
SCULPTING THE LANDSCAPE AND DRIVING THE COUNTRY INTO AN ERA FULL OF PROMISE 
THE CANALS OF NORTHERN ENGLAND BECAME AN IMPORTANT METHOD OF TRANSPORTING GOODS 
TRAVELLING BY BOAT WAS QUICK AND EASY COMPARED WITH THE OLDER METHODS 
SUCH AS HORSE AND CART 
AND THERE WAS LESS CHANCE OF POTTERY GETTING DAMAGED DURING THE TRIP 
BUT SOMETIMES THE LIE OF THE LAND WASN'T ALWAYS THE WAY THE CANAL BUILDERS WANTED IT TO BE 
FOR EXAMPLE THE TRENT AND MERSEY CANAL IS FIFTY FEET HIGHER THAN THE RIVER WEAVER 
SO HOW DID THOSE INGENIOUS VICTORIAN CANAL BUILDERS SOLVE THE PROBLEM 
OF GETTING ONE BOAT FROM ONE LEVEL TO ANOTHER 
SIMPLE THEY JUST BUILT A HUGE LIFT 
THE ANDERTON BOAT LIFT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE CATHEDRAL OF THE CANALS 
IT WAS THE WORLD'S FIRST BOAT LIFT 
ORIGINALLY BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE IT WOULD TRANSPORT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BOATS A DAY 
GOING UP AND DOWN EVERY THREE MINUTES 
WITH THE ADVENT OF THE RAILWAY SYSTEMS 
AND A DECLINE IN INDUSTRY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
THE BOAT LIFT BECAME PRIMARILY A TOURIST ATTRACTION 
BUT EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH TO KEEP IT OPEN 
AND SADLY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE IT WAS CLOSED DOWN 
WHAT FOLLOWED IS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE RESTORATION PROJECT BRITISH WATERWAYS HAS EVER SEEN 
AND I'M MEETING UP WITH LIFT MANAGER ANDY WHITEHOUSE TO LEARN A BIT MORE 
WHAT SORT OF CONDITION WAS IT IN WHEN IT WAS FIRST SHUT DOWN 
THE LIFT ITSELF WAS IN POOR CONDITION 
BRITISH WATERWAYS HAD TO CLOSE IT IMMEDIATELY 
IT NEEDED A LOT OF MONEY SPENDING ON IT 
IT HAD NOT A LOT OF MAINTENANCE WORK DONE OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS 
AND IT WAS BASICALLY DEEMED AS UNSAFE IN SOME RESPECTS 
SO IT WAS CLOSED DOWN IMMEDIATELY 
IT'S A MONSTROUS THING ISN'T IT 
HOW MUCH MONEY DID IT COST TO RESTORE 
IN TOTAL IT WAS AROUND ABOUT SEVEN MILLION GOSH 
THERE WAS A NUMBER OF BODIES 
BRITISH WATERWAYS HERITAGE LOTTERY AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY 
THEY PUT A TREMENDOUS EFFORT IN TO GET THE MONEY REQUIRED 
THEY RAISED ONE MILLION THEMSELVES ONE MILLION FROM LOCAL COMMUNITY 
THAT'S PEOPLE POWER PULLING TOGETHER AND RESTORING YOUR FAVOURITE MONUMENT 
LOOK AFTER YOUR HERITAGE BECAUSE IT IS YOUR HERITAGE THAT'S WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT 
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS 
HOW LONG WILL THE WHOLE OPERATION TAKE FROM START TO FINISH 
WE'RE AT THE FIRST STAGE WE'RE IN THE AQUEDUCT 
THIS IS ALMOST LIKE THE FIRST STAGE OF THE LIFT ITSELF 
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE GATES TO BE LIFTED UP TO ALLOW US TO SAIL INTO THE TANKS 
THE GATES'LL CLOSE BEHIND US AND WE'LL HAVE A SLOW JOURNEY TO THE LOWER LEVEL 
WE'RE NOW EMBRACED BY GREAT LUMPS OF STEEL IN THE HUB OF THIS LIFT 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT 
RIGHT WE'RE ACTUALLY IN THE LIFT NOW 
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS THE GUY AT THE TOP IS EMPTYING THE INTERSPACE 
SO IT SEPARATES THIS TANK FROM THE REST OF THE LIFT 
AND THEN WE'LL GO INTO THE LOWER SEQUENCE 
THE CAISSON ON THE OTHER SIDE WILL COUNTERBALANCE IT AND BRING THE OTHER ONE BACK UP 
SO THAT WE'RE LOWERED DOWN ONE GOES DOWN ONE COMES UP 
WE'RE ON THE MOVE I CAN FEEL IT 
WE'RE JUST NOW EBBING OUR WAY DOWN TO THE LOWER LEVEL 
WE'RE NOT NOW PART OF EITHER THE RIVER OR THE CANAL 
WE'VE SEPARATED THE TANK FROM THE CANAL 
WE'RE NOW NO LONGER PART OF EITHER 
WE'RE IN NO MAN'S LAND AS SOON AS WE HIT THE BOTTOM THE GATES ARE OPEN 
AND THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO SAIL OUT IN WHICHEVER DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO 
STOKE'S THAT WAY WHERE ALL THE POTTERIES ARE 
WE'VE GOT CHESHIRE AND THE SALT MINES CORRECT 
YOU CAN GET ON THE MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL 
YEAH EVENTUALLY YOU CAN MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL 
THESE VESSELS CARRIED A LOT OF CARGO 
WHETHER IT WAS SALT CHINA CLAY WHATEVER 
WERE THEY ALLOWED TO TRAVEL ON THE LIFT WITH A FULL LOAD 
IT DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT THE WEIGHT 
THE TANKS THEMSELVES HOLD TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TONS OF WATER 
SO YOU'VE GOT THE ARCHIMEDES THEORY OF WATER DISPLACEMENT 
SO YOU COULD STICK AS MUCH WEIGHT IN THERE AS YOU WANT 
IT'LL DISPLACE ITS OWN WEIGHT IN WATER AND TAKE YOU DOWN THROUGH THE LIFT 
THE CAISSON HAS JUST PASSED US SO THAT'S ON ITS WAY UP 
THAT WILL BE TAKING THOSE BOATERS UP TO THE TOP LEVEL 
WE'RE MAKING OUR WAY TO THE LOWER AREA 
THIS TANK WILL PARK DOWN ONTO THE LOWER RIVER 
SO THE GATE'LL LIFT UP AND WE CAN SAIL OUT AND GET ON WITH OUR JOURNEY 
A NICE SMOOTH PASSAGE 
IT REALLY DOES SUM UP THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION DOESN'T IT 
IN ALL ITS SORT OF GRINDING AND JANGLING GLORY FANTASTIC 
IT'S MAGNIFICENT IT'S GLORIOUS 
RIGHT THE GATES ARE UP AND ALL LOCKED IN POSITION 
SO WE CAN NOW SAIL OUT INTO THE RIVER AND OFF WE GO 
WE'RE GONNA GET WET WE'RE GETTING WET 
ISN'T THAT FANTASTIC YOU CAN SEE THE LIFT ITSELF IS LEANING TO THE LEFT BECAUSE OF THE CAISSONS 
WOW 
WHAT A SUPER STRUCTURE 
THE ANDERTON BOAT LIFT IS A UNIQUE PART OF OUR HERITAGE 
AND IT'S SO EASY TO SEE WHY THEY NICKNAMED THAT THE CATHEDRAL OF THE CANALS 
IT'S A SYMBOL OF VICTORIAN INGENUITY 
AND IT ALSO SHOWS THAT WHEN ENOUGH PEOPLE GET TOGETHER 
WITH THE WILLPOWER TO RESTORE AN ANCIENT MONUMENT 
THE SKY REALLY IS THE LIMIT 
EDWINA EVERY NOW AND AGAIN WE GET SOMETHING ON FLOG IT 
WHICH HAS WONDERFUL QUALITY AND IS UNUSUAL 
AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS 
RIGHT I THINK IT'S MARVELLOUS I'M INTRIGUED TO KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM 
WELL IT CAME FROM MY MOTHER'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY RIGHT 
BECAUSE HER GRANDFATHER IS A SEA CAPTAIN 
WAS A SEA CAPTAIN YES 
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT WAS GIVEN TO HIM OR PRESENTED TO HIM 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW 
WAS HE IN THE ROYAL NAVY OR THE MERCHANT NAVY 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT 
I'VE GOT A FEELING THIS HAS GOT MORE OF A MERCHANT NAVY LOOK ABOUT IT 
AND IT'S GOT TO BE A ONE OFF I THINK 
YES THIS SORT OF QUALITY WAS NOT JUST ISSUED TO EVERYBODY NO 
IT'S SILVER IT'S IN THE FORM OF A CAPSTAN 
AND IT IS A BUCKLE WHICH NO DOUBT YOU KNOW 
YES AND IT'S GOT THIS WONDERFUL ENAMELWORK ON THE FRONT HERE 
WITH THIS SCOTTISH LION ON A SHIELD 
AND I SUPPOSE WE'RE HOPING IT'S GOING TO BE MADE IN SCOTLAND 
WHICH IT ISN'T 
MADE IN BIRMINGHAM WHICH YOU CAN TELL FROM THE HALLMARK ON IT 
THE ANCHOR TELLS YOU IT WAS MADE IN BIRMINGHAM 
MY SON TOLD ME THAT OH RIGHT 
IT'S GOT A LETTER MARKED THERE FOR ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FOUR SO IT'S VICTORIAN VICTORIAN 
AND NOW THERE IS SOME OTHER WRITING ON THERE 
AND THAT'S THE RETAILER STEWART OF GLASGOW 
OH RIGHT IT'S QUITE CHUNKY ISN'T IT IT IS REALLY 
FABULOUS QUALITY 
BUT DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS EMBLEM 
NOT AT ALL NO I DON'T KNOW ANY 
MY MOTHER'S NEVER TOLD ME 
AND WHY ARE YOU THINKING OF SELLING IT 
WELL IT STAYED IN A DRAWER AT MY MOTHER'S FOR MANY MANY YEARS 
AND NOW I'VE INHERITED IT 
AT THE MINUTE IT'S IN A BAG IN THE BOTTOM OF MY WARDROBE 
VALUE 
ANY IDEAS NOT AT ALL NOT A CLUE NOT A CLUE 
NO IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO VALUE 
I'M GONNA PUT A VALUE ON IT OF BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED OH RIGHT 
YEAH 
PLEASANTLY SURPRISED I CERTAINLY AM 
ONE HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED A RESERVE OF ONE HUNDRED ON IT 
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT WORTH SELLING FOR ANY LESS N. O. 
SO IF WE CAN TURN IT INTO ONE HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED WHAT'S THAT GOING TO GO TOWARDS 
AT THE MOMENT ER 
I'M THINKING OF HAVING MY GRANDMOTHER'S GRAVE REDONE 
RIGHT THAT'S WHERE IT CAME FROM THE BUCKLE 
I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DOING WELL AT THE SALE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED RIGHT THANK YOU 
MIKE THIS IS FANTASTIC 
THIS IS BOYS' ART THIS IS A COLLAGE FOR MEN 
I CAN SEE THIS ON MY WALL BUT I WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO BUY IT 
BUT I THINK IT'S STUNNING TELL ME HOW YOU CAME ACROSS THIS 
IT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR A LONG TIME AT LEAST TWO GENERATIONS 
IT'S BEEN ON MY OFFICE WALL FOR TWENTY YEARS 
I THINK IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF IT 
IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF IT I'VE SEEN ENOUGH OF IT 
I THINK IT'S GREAT IT'S A WORK OF ART IT'S ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
DO YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE FIRM AT ALL 
IT'S M. AND W. WHICH IS MOORE AND WRIGHT SHEFFIELD STEEL 
THE BEST STEEL IN THE WORLD 
VERY WELL RESPECTED ENGINEERING COMPANY MAKING TOOLS 
THAT'S STILL GOING ISN'T IT THEY'RE STILL TRADING NOW 
HOW DID YOU COME BY THIS 
I THINK THE FAMILY BUSINESS USED TO SELL THESE TOOLS 
SO THIS WAS ON DISPLAY IN THE SHOP 
AND YOU COULD ORDER UP NUMBER SIXTY SIX 
AND YOU GOT YOURSELF A PAIR OF CALLIPERS 
THAT'S RIGHT YES PRECISION INSTRUMENTS BEAUTIFULLY MADE 
WE'VE GOT CALLIPERS DIVIDERS COMPASSES FEELER GAUGES 
ALL SORTS OF ASSORTMENTS OF SCREW DRIVERS DIFFERENT NAIL PUNCHES 
SET SQUARES CHUCK KEYS 
OH MY WORD 
THAT'S EVERY SCHOOLBOY'S DREAM YES 
IF YOU BROKE THESE DOWN INDIVIDUALLY 
THERE'S PROBABLY ABOUT WHAT TEN PER TOOL IN THERE 
BUT I JUST LIKE THE WAY THEY ARE DISPLAYED 
I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLE 
I LIKE THE MARKETING 
IT'S NICE TO SEE MARKETING DONE THIS WAY 
IT IS YES IT BELONGS IN A DESIGN MUSEUM 
OR A MUSEUM OF A BYGONE ERA 
LIKE A HERITAGE MUSEUM SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THE MARKET IS ON THIS ONE 
IT'LL DEFINITELY SUIT AN OLD ENGINEER AN OLD TOOL MAKER 
SOMEBODY LIKE THAT 
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA OF VALUE I'VE NONE AT ALL 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW EITHER I'VE NOT COME ACROSS ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE IT IS UNUSUAL 
BUT I'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S WORTH TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED OF ANYBODY'S MONEY 
ESPECIALLY IN THE AMERICAN MARKET 
IF THEY COULD SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY GO POTTY FOR TOOLS 
WE SHOULD GET IN TOUCH WITH MOORE AND WRIGHT TO SEE IF THEY'RE INTERESTED 
I'VE ALREADY E. MAILED THEM YOU HAVE 
WHAT DID THEY SAY THEY SAID PUT IT ON EBAY 
SO WE CAME TO SEE YOU TODAY 
WELL I'M SO PLEASED YOU BROUGHT THAT IN 
I'VE NOT SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR A LONG TIME 
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SELL THAT 
TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED FIXED RESERVE AT TWO HUNDRED 
HAPPY YES VERY YEP EXCELLENT LET'S DO IT 
WELL WE GO FROM A PIECE OF GOTHIC VICTORIAN DESIGN 
TO A PIECE OF NINETEEN THIRTIES KITSCH REALLY 
DO YOU LIKE THESE 
I DO LIKE THEM YES YES 
OF THEIR TYPE THEY'RE VERY GOOD EXAMPLES 
AND YOU'VE HAD A PEEK UNDERNEATH YES WE HAVE 
AND WE KNOW THEY'RE CARLTON CARLTONWARE IS A TRADE NAME 
USED BY WILTSHAW AND ROBINSON IN STOKE ON TRENT 
YOU CAN SEE THE BLACK PRINTED MARK 
QUITE A SMALL MARK THERE CARLTONWARE 
THE OTHER MARKS ARE PATTERN NUMBERS DESIGN NUMBERS AND SO ON 
THE PARTICULAR MARK ON THE BOTTOM OF THESE WOULD DATE THEM POST NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE 
SO I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY INTO THE THIRTIES THESE 
IT'S A TYPE OF CARLTONWARE THAT SELLS WELL 
THEY MADE A WHOLE HOST OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT THESE ARE NICELY DECORATED IN LUSTRE 
YOU'VE GOT THIS SORT OF PSEUDO CHINESE INSPIRED DESIGN 
WHICH WAS POPULAR IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES ON THESE LUSTRE DECORATED WARES 
QUITE VIBRANT AREN'T THEY 
THEY'RE QUITE VIBRANT QUITE WACKY I LOVE THAT LIME GREEN DON'T YOU 
IT'S A LOVELY COLOUR AND THEY'VE GOT THIS LOVELY LUSTROUS GLAZE 
WHICH WAS VERY POPULAR THEN 
AND YOU THINK ABOUT WEDGWOOD IN THE TWENTIES MAKING FAIRYLAND LUSTRE 
WHICH WAS THE ROLLS ROYCE OF THIS TYPE OF STUFF 
OTHER FACTORIES CAME IN AND COPIED THAT STYLE 
IT WAS FASHIONABLE AT THE TIME VERY FASHIONABLE 
LOVELY SHAPES 
SLIGHTLY ASYMMETRICAL SHAPES WHICH I THINK ARE GOOD FUN 
WE SELL THESE THINGS VERY WELL AT THE MOMENT 
WE PUT THEM INTO SPECIALIST SALES AND THAT SORT OF THING 
THEY'RE POPULAR ARE THEY VERY COMMERCIAL 
WHEN I STARTED DOING THIS JOB THIRTY YEARS AGO NOBODY WANTED IT 
BUT NOW YOUNG PEOPLE COLLECT CARLTONWARE 
SO I WOULD THINK IN TERMS OF VALUE WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
FOR THE TWO 
FOR THE TWO I WOULD SEE THEM MAKING SOMEWHERE AROUND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED 
RIGHT WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO SELL THEM FOR THAT YES YES 
WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO SELL THEM NOW WHAT'S SPURRED YOU ON 
I'VE GOT QUITE A LOT OF POTTERY AND I DO WATCH FLOG IT A LOT 
SO I HAD A LITTLE SORT OUT 
AND I DECIDED THAT THESE TWO WOULD BE O. K. TO BRING ALONG 
HAVE YOU OWNED THEM A LONG TIME 
I'VE HAD THEM FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS 
HAVE YOU RIGHT YES 
THEY WERE GRANDMA'S 
APPARENTLY GRANDMA SAID THAT MY SISTER AND I WERE TO HAVE ONE EACH 
BUT WE'D PREFER IT IF MUM TREATED HERSELF TO SOMETHING 
AND ENJOYED IT NOW 
I DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM SPLIT UP WOULD GRANDMA HAVE BOUGHT THEM NEW 
NO THEY WERE PASSED DOWN THEY WERE PASSED DOWN TO HER WERE THEY 
WELL WE'LL PUT THEM IN WITH A FIXED RESERVE OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
IF YOU'RE HAPPY WITH THAT 
YES THAT'S FINE I THINK THEY'LL MAKE A BIT MORE 
GOOD HAVE YOU GOT THE MONEY EARMARKED FOR SOMETHING I'LL TREAT MYSELF TO SOMETHING 
HANDBAGS ARE HER FAVOURITE HANDBAGS 
TWO HUNDRED WILL BUY YOU A SMART HANDBAG 
IT WILL WON'T IT I'VE GOT MY EYE ON ONE 
WE'VE GOT SOME KITSCH CARLTONWARE 
SOME HANDSOME HAND TOOLS AND A SUPER SILVER BUCKLE 
BUT WHICH ONE WILL BE THE HIGH FLYER AT AUCTION LET'S FIND OUT 
ADAM I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING WHAT HAS PAUL PICKED NOW

IT JUST MAKES ME SMILE SO MUCH IT REALLY DOES 
PUTS A BIG GRIN ON MY FACE 
BELONGS TO MIKE IT'S PART OF HIS FAMILY'S SOCIAL HISTORY 
THEY HAD AN IRONMONGERS SHOP THEY SOLD TOOLS 
THIS IS ONE OF THE DISPLAY CABINETS IN THE SHOP 
SO IT'S FROM HIS BYGONE ERA REALLY I LOVE IT 
IT'S A REAL MAN'S PIECE TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED 
THAT HAS GOT TO BE A BARGAIN 
IT'S A GREAT DISPLAY BUT WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH IT 
PUT IT ON THE WALL AND APPRECIATE IT WOULD YOU AT HOME 
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE RIGHT IN THE SHED 
NO NOT IN THE SHED 
IF IT WAS IN THE SHED YOU'D PROBABLY START USING SOME OF THE PUNCHES AND SCREWDRIVERS 
NO IN A HALLWAY 
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO LAUGH 
BUT IN A LOO SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT YEAH YEAH 
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT

O. K. 
WANDERING AROUND AN AUCTION HOUSE JUST BEFORE A SALE 
YOU CAN STUMBLE ACROSS ALL SORTS OF THINGS 
THAT CAN TELL US SO MUCH ABOUT OUR HISTORY 
THE GREAT FIRE OF LONDON BROUGHT DEVASTATION AND LOSS 
TO ALL THE CITY'S FINEST CRAFTSMEN 
THEY LOST THEIR WORKSHOPS THEIR WOOD STOCKS AND THEIR TOOLS 
THEY JUST COULDN'T WORK NOW THERE WAS A GREAT NEED TO REBUILD 
THE RICH AND THE WEALTHY HAD TO FURNISH THEIR HOMES 
SO THEY WENT SHOPPING ABROAD 
AND THIS IS THE SORT OF THING THEY WOULD BUY 
IT'S A WALNUT VENEERED CHEST ON STAND 
IT'S FROM HOLLAND BUT LOOK AT THE VENEERING 
IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT TO HOW THE ENGLISH WOULD HAVE VENEERED 
THIS IS KNOWN AS OYSTER VENEERING IT'S A LOVELY WALNUT CHEST 
IF YOU CAN SEE HERE 
THESE LITTLE OYSTER SHAPES ARE LITERALLY BRANCHES SAWN THROUGH 
THEN GLUED LIKE A VENEER ONTO AN OAK CARCASS 
NOW LOOK AT THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THAT 
IT'S KNOWN AS OYSTER VENEERING 
BECAUSE THEY LOOK RELATIVELY LIKE OYSTER SHELLS 
LOOK AT THE ANNUAL RINGS HERE

THAT MUST HAVE TAKEN AGES
