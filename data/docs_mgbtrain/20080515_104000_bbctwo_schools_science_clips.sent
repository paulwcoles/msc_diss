WHAT WOULD YOU MISS MOST IF THERE WAS NO ELECTRICITY T. V. 
TELEVISION RADIO 
I'D MISS MY DISHWASHER 
MY FOOD AND MY T. V. BLOW DRYING MY HAIR 
COMPUTER COMPUTER I THOUGHT SO 
COMPUTER MICROWAVE 
TELEVISION TELEVISION 
WARMTH I THINK 
MY WASHING MACHINE MY KEYBOARD 
TELEVISION T. V. 
THIS VILLAGE IN PERU DOESN'T HAVE ELECTRICITY 
WOOD FIRES FOR COOKING AND LIGHT FROM CANDLES IS NOT AN EASY LIFE 
NO DISHWASHERS OR FRIDGES WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE CANDLE POWER 
EVERYBODY GOES TO BED EARLY BECAUSE IT'S DARK 
JUST READING AND WRITING CAN BE DIFFICULT IN GLOOMY CLASSROOMS 
BUT NEAR BY THERE IS A VILLAGE THAT HAS A POWER STATION 
THIS PRODUCES ELECTRICITY WHICH IS DELIVERED TO THE VILLAGE 
THE MOST POSITIVE THING IT HAS BROUGHT IS ELECTRIC LIGHT 
WITH ELECTRICITY WE CAN HAVE ACTIVITIES AT NIGHT 
SOMETIMES ALL THE LOCALS GET TOGETHER IN THE PARK 
WHEN THERE IS A BIRTHDAY OR A NATIONAL DAY 
HER DAUGHTER JESSICA IS PLEASED TO HAVE ELECTRICITY TOO 
IT IS IMPORTANT AT NIGHT YOU CAN DO YOUR HOMEWORK 
SOME PEOPLE USE IT TO WATCH T. V. SO THEY CAN WATCH FILMS AT NIGHT 
IT MEANS YOU CAN GO OUT TOO 
YOU CAN GO TO THE PARK AT ANY TIME BECAUSE THERE IS ELECTRICITY 
WHEN THERE IS NO LIGHT YOU CAN'T GO OUT 
LUNDY ISLAND 
IT'S THE JUST OFF THE DEVON COAST 
SOME HOUSES CAN'T BE CONNECTED TO THE MAINS ELECTRICITY SUPPLY 
SO THIS HOUSE HAS GAS LAMPS CANDLES AND HEAT FROM THE FIRE 
BUT THERE IS SOME ELECTRICITY FOR THE VILLAGE 
THERE IS A GENERATOR WHICH RUNS ON OIL GENERATING ELECTRICITY 
FOR THE PEOPLE ON THE ISLAND 
BUT OIL IS EXPENSIVE SO TO SAVE THIS FUEL 
IT GETS SWITCHED OFF EVERY NIGHT AT MIDNIGHT 
THIS IS A MODERN HOUSE IN RURAL ZAMBIA 
I HAVEN'T GOT ELECTRICITY 
I USE PARAFFIN FOR MY LIGHTS 
I USE CANDLES 
AND I USE BATTERIES CAR BATTERIES TO POWER MY RECORD PLAYER 
AND I HAVE THIS STEREO 
I USE SMALL BATTERIES TO OPERATE MY RADIO CASSETTE 
IT IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE TO MANAGE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY 
BUT ZAMBIA IS A COUNTRY WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE 
OUT IN REMOTE COUNTRYSIDE 
FITTING SPECIAL PANELS THAT CAN MAKE ELECTRICITY FROM SUNLIGHT 
IS A GOOD WAY OF HAVING ELECTRICITY 
THESE PANELS ARE SOLAR PANELS 
AND MEAN YOU CAN HAVE ELECTRICITY ALL THE TIME THE SUN IS SHINING 
TIME FOR THE BIG QUESTION WHERE DOES ALL THE ELECTRICITY COME FROM 
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE THEY HAVE PYLONS AND CABLES 
TO CARRY ELECTRICITY OVER THE LAND 
BUT HERE IN THE CITY THERE'S NO ROOM FOR PYLONS 
SO WHERE DOES IT COME FROM 
WELL THE ANSWER IS UNDER THE GROUND 
WAIT A MINUTE IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE 
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING THE PAVEMENT'S MOVING 
THIS IS A SECRET ENTRANCE 
TO A WORLD OF ELECTRICITY BENEATH YOUR FEET COME AND LOOK 
DOWN THE STAIRS MIND HOW YOU GO DOWNSTAIRS 
NOW DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE OVER TWENTY NINE ZERO ZERO ZERO K. M. OF ELECTRIC CABLES 
BURIED DEEP WITHIN THE CITY OF LONDON 
END TO END THEY WOULD STRETCH FROM LONDON TO AUSTRALIA COME ALONG 
THERE ARE ELECTRICAL SUBSTATIONS ALL OVER LONDON 
INSIDE THIS ROOM THIS IS WHERE EVERYTHING HAPPENS COME WITH ME 
NOW THIS THIS THIS THIS IS WHERE IT ALL HAPPENS 
YOU SEE EACH OF THESE SWITCHES CONTROL THE ELECTRICAL SUPPLY 
THAT MAKE ALL OF THE LIGHTS IN THE CITY OF LONDON LIGHT UP 
BRILLIANT GRAND BUILDINGS TRAFALGAR SQUARE 
TRAFALGAR SQUARE FOUNTAIN 
AND OTHERS CONTROL CINEMAS AND THEATRES AND RESTAURANTS 
IF I THREW ANY OF THE SWITCHES I COULD PLUNGE THEM INTO DARKNESS 
HA HA HA 
THE ADVENTURES OF ELECTRO MOUSE 
OUR HERO SAVES THE DAY AGAIN 
IT ALL BEGAN IN THE ATTIC WHEN THIS MOUSE STUMBLED OVER AN OLD TOASTER 
YOU AND I KNOW YOU DON'T MESS WITH JUNK ESPECIALLY ELECTRICAL JUNK 
BUT THESE TWO LITTLE FELLOWS WEREN'T THAT CLUED UP 
IT WAS A GOOD THING I HAPPENED TO BE PASSING 
HARRY 
HEY STICKING KNIVES IN TOASTERS IS BAD NEWS 
YOU WERE LUCKY THIS TIME BUT OH HANG ON 
TOUCH A BARE WIRE AND YOU'RE A DEAD MOUSE 
I'VE GOT A MUCH SAFER IDEA 
I SHOWED THEM AT THIS BRAND NEW TOASTER WITH A BRAND NEW PLUG 
BECAUSE ELECTRICITY CAN BE SAFE YOU JUST HAVE TO USE IT RIGHT
