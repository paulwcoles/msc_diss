SO I HAVE SUMMONED SIXTEEN OF MY FINEST WARRIORS 
TO A LAND FAR TO THE EAST WHERE THEY MUST UNDERGO MANY TRIALS 
TO FIND THE MAGICAL WATERS TO BREAK THIS SPELL 
BUT MY OLD ENEMY HAS FOLLOWED ME HERE 
AND HE MEANS TO STOP THIS QUEST AT ANY COST 
THE QUEST TO DISCOVER THE SECRET TEMPLE 
YESTERDAY THE PANTHERS AND EAGLES GAINED FOUR JEWELS 
TO ADD TO THE SEVENTEEN ALREADY IN THEIR POSSESSION 
NOW EACH TEAM HAS A TOTAL OF TWENTY ONE GEMS 
THE WOLVES HOWEVER GAINED BUT ONE GEM AT THE THRALL THREADS 
BUT LOST TWO WARRIORS DESOT LEADER OF THE WOLVES CHOSE TO BRING BACK 
ONE OF HIS UNFORTUNATE COMRADES LYMEL 
NOW THEIR TOTAL STANDS AT TEN 
BUT THE LOWEST NUMBER OF JEWELS RESTS WITH THE TIGERS 
THOUGH ALL FOUR WARRIORS STILL MARCH UNDER THAT BANNER THEY GAINED 
BUT ONE JEWEL AT THE GIANT CATAPULT AND HOLD NOW ONLY SEVEN IN TOTAL 
TIGERS YOUR PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOW IN THE LAST TWO DAYS 
YOU HAVE COLLECTED ONLY TWO JEWELS 
AND AFTER FIVE CHALLENGES YOUR TOTAL IS A MERE SEVEN 
THAT'S NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO BRING BACK A WARRIOR IF YOU NEED TO 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS MARCA 
WELL WE'RE DOING FINE AND THERE'S STILL CHALLENGES TO COME 
SO WE'RE GONNA COLLECT MORE JEWELS TO BE ABLE TO BRING SOMEONE BACK 
I FEEL A BIT WORRIED COS IF ANYONE IS ELIMINATED 
WE CAN'T BRING THEM BACK 
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TIMES 
BUT I'M SURE WE'LL COME BACK UP FROM THIS 
COS WE'VE GOT A GREAT TEAM 
WE'RE ALL SO STRONG IN PERSONALITY AND WE'RE ALL SUCH GOOD FRIENDS 
ARE JEWELS OR COMRADES MORE IMPORTANT NOW 
COMRADES DEFINITELY 
THE WARRIORS WILL BE TESTED NOW ON THEIR WISDOM ACCURACY 
LEADERSHIP AND STRENGTH AS THEY FACE THE FIFTH OF THE FOURTEEN TASKS 
THAT AWAIT THEM UNDER THE BURNING SUN OF THIS MYSTERIOUS LAND 
SO LET THE DAY'S CHALLENGES BEGIN 
PANTHERS FOUR TOWERS LIE BEFORE YOU NOW IN RUINS 
BUT KNOW THEIR PROPER PLACE IS THERE AT THE TOP OF THIS MOUND 
EACH OF YOU MUST CARRY THE STONES AND REBUILD THE COLUMNS 
WHERE THEY WILL CATCH AND HARNESS THE RAYS OF THE MIGHTY SUN 
ONLY THEN WILL THE PRECIOUS JEWELS YOU SEEK APPEAR BEFORE YOU 
BUT BE CAREFUL FOR IF YOU ARE TOO LONG ABOUT THIS TASK 
THE DRUM WILL SOUND A SECOND TIME 
AND THE SPIRIT THAT GUARDS THIS PLACE WILL PUNISH YOUR TARDINESS 
THAT'S NOT YOUR BOX 
THE HEAT OF THE SUN ON THE BACKS OF ARTON AKSU YONRA AND SONRO 
MAKES THIS TASK ALL THE HARDER FOR THE PANTHERS 
AT THE END OF EVERY BATTLE THERE ARE THOSE WHO LIVE TO TELL THE TALE 
OF ITS GLORIES AND THOSE WHO DO NOT RETURN 
AND HERE IN THIS HAUNTED PLACE BETWEEN RUSTLING BANNERS 
LIE JUST SUCH VANQUISHED WARRIORS OF PAST CONFLICTS 
BUT THEY DO NOT REST EASILY AND THEY WILL RISE AGAINST ANY WHO DARE 
ENTER THEIR RESTING PLACE AND STARE DIRECTLY UPON THEIR BLEACHED BONES 
NOW DESOT AS LEADER OF THE WOLVES HAS CHOSEN TO WALK BLINDFOLDED 
UPON THIS ENCHANTED GROUND LYMEL WILL GUIDE HIS PROGRESS 
TOWARDS THE JEWELS HIDDEN HERE BUT IT WILL BE TREACHEROUS 
FOR SHOULD DESOT TOUCH ANY OF THE REMAINS 
OR NOT BE GUIDED TO SAFETY BEFORE THE THIRD DRUM SOUNDS 
THEN THE SPIRIT OF A DEAD SOLDIER WILL RISE AGAINST HIM 
AND HE TOO WILL JOIN THE RANKS OF THOSE DEFEATED SOULS 
AND REMAIN IN THEIR GHOSTLY COMPANY FOREVER 
TAKE A LITTLE STEP FORWARDS ALL RIGHT AND ANOTHER ONE RIGHT 
TURN NINETY DEGREES TO YOUR LEFT 
NOW TAKE FIVE LITTLE STEPS FORWARD 
THE WOLVES' TASK IS MADE MORE DIFFICULT 
AS LYMEL MUST GUIDE DESOT ALONE 
O. K. TAKE A LITTLE SHUFFLE STEP TO YOUR RIGHT 
OTHER WAY SORRY 
NOW TAKE THREE MORE STEPS FORWARD 
RIGHT NOW TURN NINETY DEGREES TO YOUR RIGHT 
TAKE THREE STEPS FORWARD 
STOP O. K. TAKE A STEP BACKWARDS BUT REALLY CAREFULLY 
STRAIGHT BEHIND YOUR FOOT O. K. TAKE A SHUFFLE STEP TO YOUR LEFT 
NO NOT THAT WAY 
TIGERS MARCA JENRO SOHAR AND HADAV PREPARE TO FACE 
THEIR FIFTH CHALLENGE OF THE QUEST RIDDLE TRAP 
WARRIORS BE WARY AS YOU APPROACH THIS TASK 
FOR THESE VERY WALLS MAY OPPOSE YOUR PROGRESS 
AS YOU STEP ON THESE STONES 
REMEMBER YOU MAY USE ONLY ONE OF THESE NUMBERS AS YOU JOURNEY 
TO AND FROM THE JEWELS THAT NUMBER YOU'LL DISCOVER NOW 
AS YOU PONDER SATYARANI'S RHYME 
TAKE THE NUMBER THAT BRINGS BACK WHEN WARRIORS ARE GONE 
PLUS THE LETTERS THAT MAKES SUN AND RAY THEN ADD THE PLANETS AND STARS 
TO THIS SUM DIVIDE BY THE NUMBER OF TASKS MINUS ONE 
THAT ANSWER WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY 
LET'S GET THE BOOK OUT THEN YEAH 
TAKE THE NUMBER THAT BRINGS BACK WHEN WARRIORS ARE GONE EIGHT 
PLUS THE LETTERS THAT MAKE SUN AND RAY THAT'S SIX OR THREE 
LET'S START WITH SIX THEN CHANGE IT TO THREE IF WE DON'T GET AN ANSWER 
ADD THE PLANETS AND STARS TO THIS SUM 
HANG ON EIGHT PLUS SIX IS FOURTEEN YEAH 
HOW MANY PLANETS EIGHT OR NINE 
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY STARS ONE THE SUN 
SO HOW MANY PLANETS ARE THERE NINE 
O. K. SO THAT MAKES TWENTY THREE 
PLUS ONE STAR MAKES TWENTY FOUR 
ARE YOU SURE BECAUSE THERE ARE ALL THOSE STARS IN THE SKY 
I THINK THEY MEAN THE NUMBER OF LETTERS 
LIKE WITH THAT ONE FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN 
TWELVE WHICH BRINGS US UP TO TWENTY SIX DIVIDE BY SO WHAT WAS THE OTHER ONE 
DIVIDE BY THE NUMBER OF TASKS MINUS ONE THAT'S THIRTEEN 
TWENTY SIX DIVIDED BY THIRTEEN IS TWO 
THAT WORKS O. K. SHALL WE SEE WHAT TWO STANDS FOR 
TURN THE PAGE HERE IT IS 
O. K. TWO THAT'S IT 
O. K. SO IT'S LIKE A SNAKE BENDING BACKWARDS THAT ONE 
IS THERE A PATH WITH A SNAKE ON IT THERE'S ONE ON THE FIRST ROW 
CAN YOU JUMP YEAH YOU CAN JUMP TO THE THIRD ROW 
ISN'T THAT I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE 
OR YOU CAN COME HERE JUMP THERE YEAH JUMP THERE 
JUMP OVER TO THE ONE THERE YEAH FORWARD 
AND THERE WHERE CAN YOU GO 
THOSE TWO THERE I THINK WE CAN DO IT 
DO WE ALL AGREE IT'S THE SNAKE YEAH 
WHO'S GOING TO DO IT 
WARRIORS IN BATTLE THE CATAPULT IS NOT THE EASIEST OF WEAPONS 
WHEN THE MACHINE PUTS ITSELF BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR ENEMY 
SO YOU MUST LEARN ITS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES AS YOU KNOW YOUR OWN 
AND THESE MISSILES MUST BE USED TO EXPOSE THEM 
YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME TO COMPLETE THIS TASK 
SO AIM QUICKLY BUT ACCURATELY 
THE DRUM WILL SOUND WHEN THE FIRST STONE IS FIRED 
AT THE SOUND OF THE SECOND DRUM YOU MUST GATHER THE JEWELS 
YOU HAVE RECOVERED AND LEAVE IMMEDIATELY 
RIGHT WHO WANTS TO GET THE BALLS TO PASS THEM INTO THE CATAPULT 
TAYLAN COS HE WAS GOOD AT SPEED 
I THINK TWO PEOPLE SHOULD PULL IT BACK COS 
MAYBE MORE MAYBE WE COULD ALL PULL IT BACK 
LET'S DECIDE SO YOU'RE THE BALLS 
AND WE'RE ALL 
MANOEUVRING THE THING YOU DIRECT AND WE ALL SHOOT 
O. K. LET'S GO WE CAN GO WE CAN DO IT YEAH

O. K. NOW THEN TURN A LITTLE BIT TO YOUR RIGHT 
O. K. NOW THEN WALK FORWARD A COUPLE OF STEPS 
STOP THERE PICK YOUR LEFT FOOT UP

QUICKLY NEXT ONE WELL DONE 
AT LAST THE EAGLES' EFFORTS HAVE PROVED SUCCESSFUL 
NEXT ONE 
GET THEM IN PLACE WE'VE GOT ONE SO FAR 
IT'S GOING GOOD IT'S GOOD IT'S FINE 
THERE IS NO SIGN OF THE DARK ONE 
ALL IS CALM AYE BUT SOMEWHERE AMONGST THOSE ROCKS SATYARANI 
HE LURKS LIKE A VIPER OR SCORPION 
WAITING IN THE SHADOWS FOR HIS CHANCE 
HE IS PLAYING THE WAITING GAME 
WHY DOES THIS CREATURE PURSUE YOU RAVEN 
BECAUSE HIS GREATEST DESIRE IS TO RULE IN THE LAND WHERE I WAS BORN 
HE CANNOT NOT WHILE I REMAIN ON THIS EARTH SO HE CURSES IT INSTEAD 
BUT I WILL LIFT THAT CURSE WITH THE HELP OF MY BRAVE WARRIORS 
I WILL RETURN TO MY HOMELAND 
BUT THESE MORTALS MUST PROVE WORTHY FIRST 
THERE IS STILL MUCH TO DO BEFORE THEY ARE ALLOWED 
TO ENTER THE SECRET TEMPLE 
THEY WILL SUCCEED SATYARANI 
THEY MUST 
C'MON ARTON 
YONRA HAS JOINED HER FELLOW PANTHERS IN COMPLETING HER TOWER 
ARTON WORKS ALONE 
QUICK KEEP GOING 
RUN 
PANTHERS NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION 
ARTON IS LOST TO THE SPIRIT GUARD 
BUT SATYARANI DECREES YOU MAY USE EIGHT JEWELS TO BUY HIM BACK 
SO YOU MUST CHOOSE 
TO KEEP THE JEWELS OR BE REUNITED WITH ARTON 
RIGHT 
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HE'S TOO MUCH OF A LIABILITY RISK 
BUT HE IS A GOOD TEAM PLAYER IF WE BRING HIM BACK THAT'S EIGHT JEWELS 
AND WE'VE GOT SO MANY MORE CHALLENGES 
IT'S EIGHT JEWELS WASTED IT'S A CHANCE WE HAVE TO TAKE 
HE COULD STILL COLLECT US MORE JEWELS HE COULD EASILY GET US TEN 
HE COULD HE COULD GET US TEN WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I THINK WE SHOULD BRING HIM BACK WHAT DO YOU THINK AKSU 
I THINK IF WE BRING HIM BACK HE'LL BE GOOD FOR THE TEAM 
SONRO WHAT HAVE YOU DECIDED 
NO OR YES GUYS QUICK 
A DECISION MUST BE GIVEN 
I THINK YES YES YES 
YOU SAY WE SHALL BRING HIM BACK 
THEN EIGHT JEWELS ARE REQUIRED 
SO THAT'S THREE 
FOUR 
FIVE SIX 
SEVEN EIGHT 
SO BE IT 
OUR TEAM LEADER SONRO WAS TRYING TO INFLUENCE US 
TO NOT BUY ARTON BACK 
BUT BOTH YONRA AND I WANTED TO BUY HIM BACK 
AFTER THINKING IT THROUGH 
SONRO TRIED TO INFLUENCE ME BUT I STUCK WITH IT 
I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT SONRO DIDN'T WANT ME BACK 
I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE EIGHT JEWELS 
BUT I HAD TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EVERYONE ELSE 
LYMEL AS THE REMAINING WOLF YOU HAVE A DIFFICULT CHOICE 
DESOT HAS BEEN LOST TO THE SPIRIT OF THE VANQUISHED WARRIOR 
YOU MAY USE EIGHT PRECIOUS JEWELS TO BUY HIM BACK 
THE CHOICE MUST BE MADE TO KEEP THE JEWELS 
OR BE REUNITED WITH YOUR LOST LEADER 
I'LL BUY DESOT BACK BECAUSE IT'LL BE SO HARD 
DOING THE REST OF THIS ON MY OWN 
PLUS ONE WAS THE ONE GUIDING HIM SO IT WAS MY FAULT REALLY 
SO BE IT 
YES THANK YOU 
THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
THANK YOU A BRAVE DECISION MY FRIENDS 
IT WAS A REALLY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE FOR BOTH OF US 
AND I TRIED HARD TO GET HIM ROUND WITHOUT TOUCHING ANYTHING 
BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE WE'VE GOT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL NOW 
COS WE'VE GOT NO MORE CHANCES 
ME AND LYMEL MUST BE VERY CAREFUL ONE MISTAKE AND WE'LL BE ELIMINATED 
YOU WERE BEST AT THE PUZZLE PATHWAY SO HOW ABOUT YOU 
DO YOU WANT TO DO IT I'LL DO IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO 
I'LL DO IT O. K. 
O. K. LET'S GO 
COME ON MARCA 
I'LL JUMP ON THIS THEN I CAN JUMP FORWARD TO THAT ONE THAT ONE 
CAN YOU JUMP IT 
WELL DONE 
THAT'S IT NEARLY THERE 
COME ON MARCA 
DON'T WORRY MARCA 
YOU WERE AMAZING TWO JEWELS IS ENOUGH 
TWO JEWELS IS GREAT TWICE AS MUCH 
I VOLUNTEERED BECAUSE I HADN'T DONE A CHALLENGE BY MYSELF 
THEN THE WALLS CAME CRASHING IN ON ME 
AND I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT 
I LOST JEWELS BUT I'M STILL IN IT 
SIT DOWN ONE TWO THREE FIRE 
IT'S O. K. IT'S ALL RIGHT 
RELEASE IT AT THE EXACT SAME TIME GUYS 
YEADA AND HER EAGLES STILL HAVE ONLY ONE TARGET HIT 
THIS TEST IS NOT FRUITFUL FOR THEM 
COME ON GET THE JEWEL 
O. K. GUYS GET THE JEWEL 
GOT IT YEAH IT'S IN THE BAG 
COME ON LET'S GO COME ON 
THIS CHALLENGE WAS REALLY HARD 
WE ONLY GOT ONE JEWEL WE THOUGHT IT'D BE EASY 
WE COULD'VE PULLED OUR WEIGHT MORE TO MAKE IT EASIER BUT WE DIDN'T 
EACH OF THE TEAMS HAS NOW COMPLETED FIVE OF THE FOURTEEN TESTS 
SO FAR THE EAGLES LEAD THE TEAMS 
AND ALL FOUR WARRIORS STILL MARCH UNDER THEIR BANNER 
TODAY THE PANTHERS LOST EIGHT JEWELS 
TO BRING BACK ARTON 
NOW THEIR TALLY STANDS AT SIXTEEN 
THE TIGERS HAVE ADDED TWO TO THEIR TOTAL 
AND HOLD NINE IN ALL 
DESOT LEADER OF THE WOLVES 
WAS LOST AT THE FIELD OF THE DEAD BRINGING HIM BACK 
NOW LEAVES HIS TEAM WITH JUST TWO JEWELS TO THEIR NAME 
LYMEL YOU BROUGHT DESOT BACK IN THE FIELD OF THE DEAD 
NOW YOU HAVE ONLY TWO JEWELS DO YOU THINK THIS WAS THE RIGHT DECISION 
YES IT WAS PARTLY MY FAULT HE HIT THE SHIELD AS I WAS GUIDING HIM 
AND ALSO HE'S A VERY GOOD WARRIOR 
BECAUSE HE'S BETTER AT RUNNING AND JUMPING THAN I AM 
DESOT DO YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS ABOUT NOT BRINGING TIBOR OR NEBRA BACK 
I DO REGRET NOT BRINGING TIBOR AND NEBRA BACK 
BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAD ENOUGH JEWELS TO BRING THEM BOTH BACK 
SONRO YOU DID NOT WANT ARTON BACK ON THE TEAM WHY WAS THIS 
WAS IT BECAUSE HE CRITICISED YOUR LEADERSHIP 
NO I DON'T THINK SO BUT WE'VE USED UP 
MOST OF HIS STRENGTHS SO FAR AND NEEDED THE JEWELS MORE 
WHEN YOU SAY HIS STRENGTHS WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
WE'VE ALREADY HAD THE FAST CHALLENGES AND THE STRENGTH CHALLENGES 
THOSE ARE HIS BEST STRENGTHS 
DOES THAT MEAN YOU THINK JEWELS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN COMRADES 
I DON'T THINK SO JUST AT THIS POINT IN TIME MAYBE 
YONRA YOU WERE DETERMINED TO KEEP ARTON 
AND YOU STUCK BY THAT WHY WAS THAT 
BECAUSE ARTON WAS A REALLY GOOD TEAM PLAYER 
WITHOUT HIM I DON'T THINK WE'D HAVE GOT ALL THE JEWELS 
I THINK IT'S MUCH BETTER IF WE KEEP HIM AND WE'LL COLLECT MORE JEWELS 
AND AKSU YOU SEEMED QUITE UNDECIDED 
BUT SLOWLY YOU MOVED TO YONRA'S DECISION WHY WAS THAT 
WELL I WAS CONFUSED 
WITH WHETHER TO KEEP THE JEWELS OR TO BRING BACK ARTON 
BECAUSE ARTON HAS LOTS OF STRENGTHS 
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE THE JEWELS 
THEN I DECIDED THE TEAM WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE JEWELS 
ARTON WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO THE TEAM 
NOTHING REALLY 
JUST THANKS FOR BRINGING ME BACK 
WOULD YOU HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY HAD YOU BEEN LEADER NO 
I'D HAVE BROUGHT BACK THE PERSON WHO GOT PUT OUT 
SO THE SUN SETS ONCE MORE 
AND THE WARRIORS ARE AT REST 
BUT I FEAR NEVAR WILL DESPATCH HIS DEMONS AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY 
TO STOP THEM REACHING THE SECRET TEMPLE 
HOW MANY HAS HE AMASSED AGAINST ME 
HOW MANY OF THESE VILE CREATURES HAS 
I MUST BE VIGILANT 
BUT I FEAR I WILL KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT DARK QUESTION VERY SOON 
NEXT TIME ON RAVEN THE SECRET TEMPLE 
THE EAGLES' ACCURACY IS CRUCIAL IN ARCHERY 
ENCHANTED DEMONS WILL TEST SONRO'S LEADERSHIP TO THE FULL 
DESOT IS ON A KNIFE EDGE AS THE WOLVES TACKLE OBELISKS OF THE SUN 
AND ONLY THE TIGERS' AGILITY CAN GET THEM PAST THRALL THREADS 
I KNOW NEVAR MEANS US HARM 
I AM READY FOR HIS TRICKS BUT THE WARRIORS MUST BE TOO
