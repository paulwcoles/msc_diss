I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU ON A JOURNEY THROUGH 
SOME OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT SCENERY TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE ON EARTH 
THE LANDSCAPE OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
WE'LL SEE GREAT LAKES AND LOCHS 
ROLLING HILLS AND DOWNLAND 
CORNERS OF THE COUNTRY LIKE A GARDEN IN FLOWER 
I'LL SAIL ROUND DRAMATIC STRETCHES OF OUR COASTLINE 
WHERE WHITE CLIFFS RISE LIKE A FORTRESS FROM THE SEA 
OUR LOVE OF THIS COUNTRYSIDE SEEMS NATURAL TO US 
YET IT'S ONLY IN THE LAST THREE HUNDRED YEARS 
THAT WE'VE LEARNT TO APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF OUR OWN LANDSCAPE 
IT TOOK A GROUP OF PIONEERING ARTISTS 
TO OPEN OUR EYES TO THE SPLENDOUR OF OUR ISLANDS 
IT WAS HERE IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
THAT ARTISTS AND WRITERS FIRST BEGAN TO EXPLORE 
THE WILDER PARTS OF BRITAIN 
AND TO SEE BEAUTY WHERE BEFORE PEOPLE HAD ONLY SEEN SAVAGERY 
SO THIS IS THE LANDSCAPE THAT CHANGED OUR VIEW OF THE WORLD 
THIS IS THE ROMANTIC NORTH WHERE THE ART OF BRITISH LANDSCAPE WAS BORN 
THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
THE SCENERY THAT INSPIRED A REVOLUTION 
IN THE WAY WE THINK AND FEEL ABOUT BRITISH LANDSCAPE 
IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO SEE WHY 
I'M FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS 
OF SOME OF OUR GREATEST WRITERS AND PAINTERS 
TO THE PLACE WHERE OUR LOVE OF THE BRITISH LANDSCAPE BEGAN 
I'M HEADING FOR THE LAKE DISTRICT 
THE LAKE DISTRICT IS JUST A SMALL CORNER OF ENGLAND 
BUT IT CONTAINS SOME OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR SCENERY IN THE COUNTRY 
ARTISTS AND POETS HAVE PRODUCED THEIR GREATEST WORK HERE 
CELEBRATING THE LANDSCAPE 
THE FIRST TIME I CAME TO THE LAKES I WAS E. R. SEVENTEEN I CAME WITH MY BROTHER 
WE WERE MAKING A HOLIDAY FILM 
WE'RE OFF ON A HOLIDAY JOURNEY 
WE WENT ALL OVER THE PLACE WE WENT WALKING AROUND THE HILLS 
WE WENT WATER SKIING 
WE WENT TO SEE THE SNUFF FACTORY AT KENDAL 
WE WENT ON A STEAM TRAIN' 
WE ATE OUR HIGH TEAS AT HALF PAST SIX 
IT'S A LONG TIME AGO 
AND THE EXTRAORDINARY THING IS IT REALLY HASN'T CHANGED VERY MUCH 
WHAT HAS CHANGED AND IT'S QUITE EXTRAORDINARY IS THE WAY WE SPOKE 
JONATHAN WHO'S MUCH LIGHTER AND PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT MORE AGILE 
WENT UP LIKE A CAT BUT MY PROGRESS WASN'T QUITE SO FAST 
I MEAN I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S THE SAME PERSON TALKING 
JONATHAN WENT UP LIKE A CAT 
AND THE HAT I MEAN WAS THAT REALLY ME 
ANYWAY THAT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO AND THIS IS NOW AND WHAT'S MAGICAL 
IS THAT THIS IS THE SAME LANDSCAPE THAT THEY SAW THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
AND YOU CAN SEE IT NOW IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL 
BUT THE LAKE DISTRICT DIDN'T ALWAYS INSPIRE PEOPLE 
NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT WAS A PLACE TO AVOID 
WHEN THE AUTHOR OF ROBINSON CRUSOE DANIEL DEFOE CAME HERE IN THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTIES 
HE MADE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THIS WAS THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH HE WANTED TO BE 
HE SAID IT WAS THE WILDEST MOST TERRIBLE AND FRIGHTFUL OF ANY OF THE PLACES HE'D PASSED 
HE SAID THAT THE PLEASANT PART OF ENGLAND WAS AT AN END 
DEFOE'S OPINION WASN'T UNUSUAL FOR THE TIME 
THE COUNTRYSIDE WAS A HOSTILE PLACE 
BAD ROADS MEANT ACCIDENTS WERE COMMON 
STAGECOACH TRAVELLERS WERE PREY TO HIGHWAYMEN 
AND IF YOU DIDN'T GET ROBBED AT GUNPOINT 
THERE WERE BOGS AND MARSHES TO DROWN YOU 
BRITAIN WAS STILL A LAND OF SUPERSTITION AND FOLKLORE 
THE COUNTRYSIDE WAS HAUNTED BY EVIL SPIRITS BY GOBLINS BY WITCHES 
BUT THAT VISION WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE WITH THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA 
THE REVOLUTION WAS STARTED BY ONE MAN 
HE WAS A LOCAL CLERGYMAN CALLED DOCTOR JOHN BROWN 
AND HE SAW THINGS IN A NEW LIGHT 
HE WROTE A LETTER ABOUT IT IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY TWO 
HE SAW THIS WILDERNESS AS SOMETHING WONDERFUL 
ALBEIT SOMETHING WITH AN ELEMENT OF DANGER 
THE PERFECTION OF KESWICK HE SAID RESTS ON THREE CIRCUMSTANCES 
NOBODY HAD TALKED ABOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE LIKE THIS BEFORE 
BUT TRAVELLERS BACK FROM GRAND TOURS OF THE CONTINENT 
WERE EXCITED BY ITS DRAMATIC SCENERY AND BY THE PAINTERS WHO CAPTURED IT 
THEY BEGAN LOOKING FOR THE SAME EXCITEMENT AT HOME 
IT WAS THE BIRTH OF THE PICTURESQUE 
BROWN WAS RAPTUROUS THE LAKES WERE IMMENSE AMPHITHEATRES 
SURROUNDED BY LOFTY MOUNTAINS PIERCING THE CLOUDS' 
WATERFALLS NEVER JUST TRICKLED 
THEY TUMBLE IN VAST SHEETS 
FROM ROCK TO ROCK IN RUDE AND TERRIBLE MAGNIFICENCE 
CLOUDS WERE GLOOMY AND GREAT 
AND ROCKS AND CLIFFS WERE OF STUPENDOUS HEIGHT 
IMMENSE AND AWFUL IS HOW BROWN DESCRIBED THIS VIEW 
BUT HE TENDED TO LAY IT ON WITH A TROWEL 
I MEAN RUDE TERRIBLE HORRIBLE GRANDEUR HE TALKED ABOUT THE GLOOMY GREATNESS OF THIS PART OF THE LAKES 
WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO WAS CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE SAW THE LANDSCAPE 
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TOO WILD TOO FRIGHTFUL TO LOOK AT HE WAS SAYING ACTUALLY IT CAN BE REALLY EXCITING 
ALL THE MORE EXCITING PERHAPS BECAUSE THERE'S JUST A WHIFF OF DANGER 
WRITERS AND ARTISTS WERE SOON EXPLORING THE LAKES 
PIONEERS IN FRONTIER TERRITORY 
THEY WERE COMPARED TO BIG GAME HUNTERS TRACKING DOWN 
WILD AND SAVAGE SCENES TO HANG LIKE TROPHIES ON THEIR WALL 
THEIR PAINTINGS WERE ENOUGH TO WHET THE APPETITE OF WEALTHY TOURISTS 
AND IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THEY TOO 
BEGAN TO DEVELOP A TASTE FOR WILDERNESS 
BY THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTIES THE LAKE DISTRICT WAS 
THE MOST FASHIONABLE TOURIST DESTINATION IN BRITAIN 
HE PREFERS ICE CREAM 
THE LOCALS CASHED IN 
HOTELS INNS BOAT HIRE BUSINESSES WERE SET UP TO CATER FOR THE GROWING NUMBER OF VISITORS 
HELLO AFTERNOON ARE YOU READY FOR A NICE AFTERNOON'S TRIP OUT 
THEN COME AND GET ON BOARD LET'S GO THANKS 
MANY OFFERED THEMSELVES AS GUIDES TO TOURISTS WHO WERE FEARFUL OF EXPLORING THE LAKES ALONE 
LET'S GO AND HAVE A TOUR OF THE LAKES 
EVEN THEN THERE WERE TRAFFIC JAMS 
AS CARRIAGES CLOGGED THE ROADS TO THE MAIN SIGHTS 
HELLO WELCOME TO YOU ALL WELCOME TO THE AFTERNOON TOUR MY NAME IS STEVE GOOD AFTERNOON 
GOOD AFTERNOON WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SHORT TRIP ROUND THE SOUTHERN LAKES AREA THIS AFTERNOON 
BASICALLY WE ARE A NATIONAL PARK MADE UP OF NINE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES 
WE HAVE A POPULATION OF JUST OVER FORTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE 
THEN DURING THE COURSE OF A NORMAL SEASON 
THAT IS SWELLED BY UP TO FIFTEEN MILLION TOURISTS 
THE FIRST TOURISTS WERE A VERY DEMANDING LOT 
THEY WERE RICH ADVENTUROUS AND WERE SEEKING THRILLS 
THEY WERE PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE GONE ON A GRAND TOUR OF EUROPE 
BUT WITH THE TURBULENCE ON THE CONTINENT THEY WERE FORCED TO STAY HERE AT HOME 
BUT THEY DIDN'T JUST WANT TO GO ON AN ORDINARY JOURNEY 
THEY WANTED TO SEE THE VERY BEST SIGHTS 
AND PARTICULARLY PLACES WHERE THEY COULD DO LANDSCAPE PAINTING 
AND THOMAS WEST CAME TO THEIR RESCUE 
THOMAS WEST WROTE THIS THE VERY FIRST GUIDEBOOK TO THE LAKES AND IT SOON BECAME A BESTSELLER 
SO THAT EVERYBODY TRAVELLING HERE WOULD CARRY THIS BOOK WITH THEM 
WEST GAVE CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS TO THE EXACT VANTAGE POINTS FROM WHICH TO PAINT THE BEST VIEWS 
HE CALLED EACH STOPPING POINT A STATION 
AND CHOSE TWENTY ONE PERFECT SPOTS AROUND THE FOUR MAIN LAKES 
TOURISTS HAVE BEEN FLOCKING HERE SINCE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT 
THIS WAS THE FIRST STATION RECOMMENDED BY WEST ON DERWENTWATER 
HE DESCRIBES IT AS AN ELEGANT SHEET OF WATER SPREAD OUT BEFORE YOU 
SHINING LIKE A MIRROR AND TRANSPARENT AS CRYSTAL 
AND HE SAYS THAT ON A FINE DAY THE SUN PLAYS UPON THE BOSOM OF THE LAKE 
AND THE SURROUNDING MOUNTAINS ARE ILLUMINATED BY ITS REFULGENT RAYS 
MAGNIFICENT 
BEAUTIFUL EVENING IT'S BEEN ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT HASN'T IT 
MARVELLOUS DREAMY IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT ETHEREAL 
BUT IT BRINGS OUT THE POET IN YOU OH DEFINITELY YES YEAH 
TODAY PEOPLE TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS 
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WEST'S BOOK SPARKED A FRENZY OF AMATEUR PAINTING 
WHILE PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS CASHED IN ON A GROWING DEMAND FOR SOUVENIR PRINTS 
AND ONCE THEY'D TIRED OF ONE VIEW 
THEY'D DASH OFF TO THE NEXT STATION TO SEE WHAT ELSE WEST HAD IN STORE 
WE'RE TOLD TO OBSERVE TWO HUGE FRAGMENTS OF FERRUGINOUS COLOURED ROCK 
WHICH I THINK ARE THESE 
WITH THIS IRON IN THE ROCK THAT'S THE FERRUGINOUS BIT 
NOW FROM HERE WEST SAYS ALL THAT IS GREAT AND PLEASING ON THE LAKE 
ALL THAT IS GRAND AND SUBLIME IN THE ENVIRONS 
LIE BEFORE YOU IN A BEAUTIFUL ORDER AND NATURAL DISPOSITION 
THE MOST PAINTED OF STATIONS WAS THE MONUMENTAL BOWDER STONE 
A TWO THOUSAND TON BOULDER WHICH WEST DESCRIBES AS A MOUNTAIN IN ITSELF 
BUT PACKING A COPY OF WEST'S GUIDE IN YOUR TRUNK WASN'T ENOUGH 
TO CAPTURE THE FULL GLORY OF THE LANDSCAPE 
YOU HAD TO HAVE THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT 
ANY SELF RESPECTING AMATEUR ARTIST 
WOULD COME LADEN WITH AN ARRAY OF PARAPHERNALIA 
COR I'LL PUT THIS ON HERE 
YOU'VE GOT AN AWFUL LOT OF CLOBBER HERE 
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY OR AMATEUR ARTIST WOULD PROBABLY BRING ALONG 
TO HELP HIM APPRECIATE THE LANDSCAPE TELESCOPE 
YES DOES IT WORK TO ENJOY THE VIEW 
WHAT'S THIS THAT'S A COLLECTION OF BRUSHES PENCILS LOVELY 
AN EARLY MAP OF DERWENTWATER 
IT LOOKS LIKE WHERE BURIED TREASURE IS DOESN'T IT 
THE DRAWING BOOK THAT IS AN OLD WATERCOLOUR BOX 
AND WHAT'S THIS THIS IS BEAUTIFUL IT IS ISN'T IT IT IS A PEDOMETER 
IT ATTACHES TO THE BELT AND THE OTHER END TO THE BOOT 
AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY KNEW HOW MANY MILES THEY'D WALKED 
HOW BRILLIANT NOTHING LEFT TO CHANCE 
AND WHAT'S THIS LAST ONE WELL THAT IS THE CLAUDE GLASS 
AND THIS IS ONE OF A DIFFERENT SHAPE 
THE CLAUDE GLASS NAMED AFTER THE FRENCH LANDSCAPE PAINTER CLAUDE LORRAINE 
WAS A DEVICE TO FRAME THE LANDSCAPE LIKE A CAMERA VIEWFINDER 
SO THAT THE PAINTER WASN'T OVERWHELMED BY ITS VASTNESS' 
YOU HOLD IT UP AND LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER 
IT'S SUCH A FUNNY IDEA THOUGH ISN'T IT 
COMING TO A GREAT LANDSCAPE AND THEN TURNING YOUR BACK ON IT AND LOOKING AT IT THIS WAY ROUND 
BUT I DO SEE THE POINT OF IT 
IT'S A WAY OF SORT OF TAKING CHARGE OF THE LANDSCAPE ISN'T IT YES 
AND ALSO PROBABLY TAMING THE LANDSCAPE WITHIN THAT FRAME AS WELL 
WHAT YOU SEE IS A SORT OF ENHANCED VERSION CLEARER VERSION OF THE LANDSCAPE 
AS IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A ROMANTIC IMAGE 
CAN I SEE THAT ONE THIS 
OF COURSE YOU GET A MUCH SMALLER IMAGE 
BUT A RATHER NICE OVAL LANDSCAPE 
OH YES 
THAT'S GREAT 
WE SHOULD START MAKING THEM AGAIN COS IT'S A GOOD WAY OF SEEING IT IS 
THEN THERE'S ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE 
TINTED LENSES 
OH YES AND THIS WAS ANOTHER TOURIST GIMMICK REALLY WAS IT 
SO YOU COULD HAVE AUTUMN WINTER EVENING 
YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT VERY CLOSE TO SEE AH NOW 
THAT IS 
LIKE A SORT OF VIOLENT SUNSET 
DEEP DEEP RED SUNSET 
VERY EERIE LOOKING 
THIS ONE IS 
LIKE A SORT OF SERENE SUMMER DAY EVERYTHING'S GONE GOLDEN YELLOW 
LOVELY THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL 
H. M. M. TIME FOR PICNIC OR LUNCH 
AND THIS ONE 
THIS IS REALLY STRANGE 
THIS IS LIKE MOONLIGHT ISN'T IT 
IT'S ALL GONE COLD ALL THE COLOUR'S GONE OUT EXCEPT THE BLUES 
IT'S INTERESTING 
IT'S STRANGE USING CHARCOAL IT FORCES ME TO BE BOLDER 
ABSOLUTELY THAT'S GOOD ISN'T IT MY INSTINCT'S TO DO TINY LITTLE 
CAN I HAVE A LOOK IS THAT ALLOWED O. K. MY INSTINCT IS TO DO TINY LITTLE DRAWINGS YOU SEE ACTUALLY 
THAT'S THAT'S NICE THAT'S NICE THAT'S SSH SHUT YOUR MOUTH 
LEAVE ME TO IT 
SOMETIMES JUST PAINTING VIEWS WASN'T ENOUGH 
ARTISTS WANTED TO EXPERIENCE THE LANDSCAPE IN OTHER WAYS 
IN THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY FLEETS OF BOATS WERE READY TO TAKE TRAVELLERS 
ON EXCURSIONS ROUND THE LAKE 
DEEPENING THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE LANDSCAPE AND ITS SUBTLETY 
AND ONCE THAT TASTE WAS SATISFIED 
THEY FACED A QUITE DIFFERENT ASSAULT ON THEIR SENSES 
THE BOAT WAS MANOEUVRED TO A PARTICULAR SPOT ON THE LAKE 
WHERE VALLEYS LED OFF IN ALL DIRECTIONS' WHOOPS 
LIKE THAT 
THE TOURISTS WOULD LINE UP ON THE DECK WHERE CANNON WERE POSITIONED 
UP TO TWELVE CANNON ON ONE PARTICULAR BOAT 
AND THIS IS WHAT THEY WERE WAITING FOR 
ONE 
TWO 
THREE GREAT GREAT 
AS THAT BANG REVERBERATES UP AND DOWN THE VALLEY 
THERE'S A BIT OF WIND TODAY AND IT'S NOT WORKING AS WELL AS IT MIGHT 
IT'S ALSO RAINING A BIT WHICH CAN'T HELP 
APPARENTLY IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH THESE MOUNTAINS ARE CRUMBLING 
AND THE WHOLE PLACE IS FALLING INTO THE LAKE 
AND THESE TRAVELLERS WOULD COME HERE JUST TO HEAR THAT SOUND 
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BACKWARDS FORWARDS BACKWARDS FORWARDS 
UNTIL THE FINAL BANG WAS AS LOUD AS THE VERY FIRST BANG 
I CAN ONLY HEAR AN AEROPLANE 
ONE TWO THREE 
BOOM BOOM BOOM 
I THINK I'M GOING DEAF 
CAPTURING THE DRAMA OF THE SCENE WAS A CHALLENGE FOR THE ARTIST 
BUT A PAINTER NAMED WILLIAM GILPIN HAD A SOLUTION 
GILPIN PUBLISHED A SET OF RULES 
FOR THOSE WHO WANTED TO CREATE A TRULY PICTURESQUE PAINTING 
THEY WERE LIKE THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 
FOR THE FASHIONABLE ARTISTS OF THE DAY 
THE PICTURESQUE SCENE SHOULD INCLUDE A DISTANT CRAGGY MOUNTAIN 
SMOOTH ROUNDED HILLS ARE OUT 
THE FOREGROUND HAD TO BE FILLED WITH TREES WATERFALLS AND ROCKS 
BUT NOT ANY OLD ROCKS YOU UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE TO BE RUGGED 
NOT SMOOTH 
AND GREY NOT RED SO THEY CONTRAST WITH THE GREENERY 
EVEN ANIMALS DON'T ESCAPE HIS UNFORGIVING EYE 
HE ADMITS THAT HORSES ARE NOBLER THAN COWS 
BUT SAYS FROM THE PICTURESQUE POINT OF VIEW THE COW IS SUPERIOR 
BECAUSE THE HORSE IS ALL SOFT AND NICE CURVES 
WHEREAS THE COW IS ANGULAR AND MUCH BETTER SUITED TO DRAWING WITH A PENCIL 
THE ONLY THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT COWS IS THEY'RE SO LARGE YOU DON'T WANT TOO MANY OF THEM IN YOUR FOREGROUND 
IDEALLY JUST THREE EITHER IN A GROUP 
OR TWO AND THEN ONE SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE 
THE SHEEP IS JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE COW AND AS WELL ADAPTED TO PAINTING 
AS LONG AS IT HASN'T BEEN SHORN 
GILPIN'S RULES SOUND A BIT OBSESSIVE BUT THEY WERE FOLLOWED EVEN BY PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS 
WHEN PHILIPPE DE LOUTHERBOURG VISITED THE LAKE DISTRICT 
IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HE HAD GILPIN'S BOOK IN ONE HAND 
AND HIS PAINTBRUSH IN THE OTHER 
HIS PAINTING OF ULLSWATER HAS ALL THE RIGHT INGREDIENTS 
TEXTURED ROCKS 
A LAKE 
A ROMANTIC RUIN IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE 
AND OF COURSE THOSE NICELY ORDERED CATTLE 
GILPIN WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE TARGET 
TO THOSE WHO THOUGHT PICTURESQUE TOURS WERE BECOMING A BIT RIDICULOUS 
THOMAS ROWLANDSON THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS CARTOONIST OF THE DAY 
MOCKED GILPIN MERCILESSLY 
HELVELLYN ONE OF THE HIGHEST 
AND MOST TREACHEROUS MOUNTAINS IN BRITAIN 
AT OVER THREE THOUSAND F. T. IT CAN BE A CHALLENGING CLIMB 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIVE A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD ASPIRING ARTIST CALLED CHARLES GOUGH 
SET OFF WITH HIS DOG TO SCALE THE MOUNTAIN 
HE WAS NEVER SEEN ALIVE AGAIN 
TWO HUNDRED YEARS AFTER HE DISAPPEARED I'M ON THE TRAIL OF GOUGH 
I'M IN GOOD HANDS 
MY GUIDE CLIMBS HELVELLYN EVERY DAY WHATEVER THE WEATHER 
TO GAUGE IF IT'S SAFE FOR OTHERS TO FOLLOW 
TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO THEY TALKED ABOUT THIS LANDSCAPE ALL FULL OF DISCUSSION 
ABOUT THE HORRORS AND THE TERRORS OF THE MOUNTAINS AND ALL THAT 
WERE THEY EXAGGERATING OR IS IT A DANGEROUS PLACE 
IT'S A MATTER OF OPINION 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL I LOVE IT BUT WHAT KINDS OF THINGS HAPPEN TO PEOPLE DO PEOPLE GET KILLED THERE 
YEAH THE LAST THREE YEARS 
THREE PEOPLE HAVE FALLEN ON HELVELLYN TO THEIR DEATHS 
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING GAWD 
I SUPPOSE IT'S WORTH IT 
OH 
I MEAN IT FEELS QUITE COOL UP HERE 
WHAT READINGS DO YOU TAKE 
THE AIR TEMPERATURE I'M GETTING AT THE MOMENT IS MINUS TWO POINT FIVE DEGREES CENTIGRADE 
BUT THE TEMPERATURE YOU FEEL ON THE SKIN THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT'S THE ONE THAT GETS YOU 
MINUS THIRTEEN MINUS FOURTEEN YEAH SO AS THE WIND PICKS UP SO THE TEMPERATURE DROPS 
YEAH M. I. N. U. S. TWELVE 
WHAT'S THE COLDEST YOU COULD GET UP HERE 
THE COLDEST I'VE HAD WITH THE WIND CHILL WAS MINUS THIRTY TWO DEGREES REALLY 
AND THAT WAS COLD THAT WAS VERY COLD YEAH 
IT'S BELIEVED CHARLES GOUGH TRIED TO REACH THE SUMMIT OF HELVELLYN 
BY CLIMBING A PRECARIOUS RIDGE CALLED STRIDING EDGE 
THE PATH IS NARROW AND DANGEROUS WITH DROPS ON EITHER SIDE 
PEOPLE STILL GET INTO TROUBLE UP HERE 
AND IT'S HERE THAT GOUGH'S TRAIL GOES COLD 
LOOK AT THIS IT'S REAL NATURAL BEAUTY I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING 
YES YOU CAN THE FROZEN TARN THE SNOW 
IT'S AS NATURAL AS WE GET IN ENGLAND 
IT'S REALLY UNTAMED ON A DAY LIKE TODAY 
YOU CERTAINLY FEEL THAT NATURE PREDOMINATES HERE NOT MAN 
ABSOLUTELY NATURE TOLERATES US IN A PLACE LIKE THIS 
UM IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF BEING CONQUERED BY MAN OR ANYTHING 
NATURE LETS YOU IN ON HER TERMS 
OH I WOULD SAY SO 
HELLO LITTLE DOG 
CHARLES GOUGH WASN'T SO LUCKY 
THREE MONTHS AFTER HE DISAPPEARED 
A SHEPHERD FOUND HIS BODY AT THE EDGE OF A LAKE CALLED RED TARN 
HE'D FALLEN TO HIS DEATH FROM STRIDING EDGE 
GOUGH'S BELONGINGS A SKETCH BOOK A PENCIL AND A CLAUDE GLASS 
SUGGESTED HE'D DIED IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT VIEW 
THERE WAS ONE MYSTERY ABOUT GOUGH'S DEATH 
WHEN HIS BODY WAS FOUND THE BONES WERE SCATTERED ALL AROUND 
WHITENED AND WITH NO FLESH ON THEM 
AND BESIDE HIM KEEPING GUARD WAS HIS DOG 
NOW SOME PEOPLE SAID THE DOG HAD BEEN THERE FAITHFUL ALL THOSE WEEKS 
JUST LOOKING AFTER HIS MASTER'S DEAD BODY 
BUT OTHERS POINTED OUT THAT THE DOG WAS SUSPICIOUSLY FAT 
GOUGH BECAME A MARTYR TO LANDSCAPE ART 
HIS DEATH INSPIRED AN EVER GROWING BAND OF ROMANTIC POETS AND PAINTERS 
QUEEN VICTORIA'S FAVOURITE PAINTER SIR EDWIN LANDSEER IMAGINED THE SCENE 
POOR GOUGH FROZEN FOREVER 
THE ROMANTIC VICTIM RATHER THAN THE FAMOUS ARTIST HE HAD ASPIRED TO BE 
ONE SUMMER EVENING IN THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTIES 
A BOY WAS WALKING BY A LAKE IN PATTERDALE 
HE DISCOVERED A BOAT A SMALL SKIFF TIED TO A WILLOW TREE 
ON AN IMPULSE HE STOLE THE BOAT 
AND ROWED OUT ON TO THE MOONLIT LAKE 
THE BOY WAS WILLIAM WORDSWORTH 
AND HE WAS ABOUT TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING 
THAT HE SAID HELPED FORGE HIS DESTINY AS A POET 
WHILE HE WAS ROWING A STRANGE THING HAPPENED TO HIM 
A ROCKY CLIFF APPEARED ABOVE THE HORIZON A GREAT OUTCROP OF STONE 
AND HE LOOKED UP AT IT AND AS HE STARTED TO ROW AWAY FROM IT 
IT SUDDENLY SEEMED TO HIM TO BE COMING ALIVE 
HE ROWED FASTER AND FASTER AND THE FASTER HE ROWED 
THE MORE IT SEEMED TO BE CHASING HIM 
UNTIL IN TERROR AND HIS HANDS SHAKING 
HE TURNED HIS BOAT AND SLIPPED QUIETLY AWAY 
BACK TO WHERE HE'D STOLEN IT FROM 
THE EXPERIENCE HAD A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE YOUNG WORDSWORTH 
IT CONSTANTLY CAME INTO HIS DREAMS 
WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS HE'D SEEN NATURE SUDDENLY AT ITS MOST POWERFUL ITS MOST AWE INSPIRING 
AND REALISED HOW PITIFULLY SMALL MAN WAS BY COMPARISON 
WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT MOONLIT LAKE AFFECTED HIS ENTIRE LIFE'S WORK 
AS AN ADULT WORDSWORTH SETTLED IN GRASMERE WITH HIS SISTER DOROTHY 
LIVING IN DOVE COTTAGE 
HERE HE BECAME PASSIONATE ABOUT THE NATURAL WORLD 
FROM THE GREATEST MOUNTAIN 
TO THE SMALLEST FLOWER 
I WANDER'D LONELY AS A CLOUD 
THAT FLOATS ON HIGH O'ER VALES AND HILLS 
WHEN ALL AT ONCE I SAW A CROWD 
A HOST OF GOLDEN DAFFODILS 
BESIDE THE LAKE BENEATH THE TREES 
FLUTTERING AND DANCING IN THE BREEZE 
WORDSWORTH WROTE HIS MOST FAMOUS POEM AFTER A WALK WITH DOROTHY 
ROUND THE BANKS OF ULLSWATER ONE APRIL AFTERNOON IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWO 
AS THEY SET OFF HOME THEY WERE UPLIFTED 
BY THE SIGHT OF THESE YELLOW FLOWERS SWAYING IN THE WIND 
WHEN THE POEM WAS PUBLISHED SOME OF HIS ADMIRERS WERE DISMAYED 
EVEN DISGUSTED AT WHAT THEY SAW AS HIS SELF INDULGENCE 
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE WITH SUCH A MAGICAL COMMAND OF WORDS 
COULD SQUANDER THEM ON SOMETHING SO PALTRY SO COMMONPLACE AS DAFFODILS 
WHAT PERHAPS THEY HADN'T UNDERSTOOD 
WAS THAT AT THE HEART OF THE ROMANTIC IDEA 
WAS THE NOTION THAT ANY EXPERIENCE WHETHER GREAT OR SMALL 
COULD SPARK THE IMAGINATION 
WE GET AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE HERE COMING NOW 
AND THEY ALL WANT TO COME AND SEE WHERE THE DAFFODILS WERE 
PEOPLE SIT THERE AND SOMEBODY RECITES THE POEM 
SO THE DAFFODILS ARE TRAMPLED HALF TO DEATH ARE THEY EVERY SUMMER OR SPRING 
WELL YES WE DO GET THAT PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE TRAMPLING ON THEM 
WE DO GET THINGS LIKE PEOPLE COME AND WANT TO PICK THEM 
WE DON'T MIND THAT SO MUCH BUT THE ONES WHO COME AND WANT TO DIG THEM UP AND TAKE 'EM HOME 
SO THEY CAN HAVE THEIR LITTLE CLUMP OF WORDSWORTH'S DAFFS IN THEIR GARDEN DO ANNOY US A LITTLE BIT 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE DAFFODIL THAT'S SO SPECIAL 
I DON'T KNOW REALLY IT'S COS IT'S A LITTLE FIGHTER I THINK 
IT'S A LITTLE YELLOW FLOWER THAT POPS OUT EVERY SPRING 
I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S A RARE FLOWER IN ENGLAND 
BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PLACES WHERE IT'S STILL GROWING LIKE THIS 
WHERE IT'S GROWN FOR WELL WE KNOW FOR AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS ON THIS SITE 
HIGH ON THE FELLS THE POET SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE HAD 
A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE OF THE LAKES 
UNLIKE HIS FRIEND WORDSWORTH WHO FOUND HAPPINESS HERE 
COLERIDGE WAS DESCENDING INTO A KIND OF PRIVATE HELL 
HE'D LONG BEEN AN OPIUM ADDICT AND UP HERE HE FOUND A NEW DRUG 
CALLED KENDAL BLACK DROP A MIXTURE OF BRANDY AND OPIUM 
FAR STRONGER THAN ANYTHING HE'D HAD BEFORE 
IT GAVE HIM SUCH APPALLING NIGHTMARES 
THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY AFRAID TO GO TO SLEEP 
HENCE VIPER THOUGHTS THAT COIL AROUND MY MIND 
REALITY'S DARK DREAM 
I TURN FROM YOU AND LISTEN TO THE WIND 
WHICH LONG HAS RAVED UNNOTICED 
WHAT A SCREAM OF AGONY BY TORTURE LENGTHENED OUT 
THAT LUTE SENT FORTH 
THOU WIND THAT RAV'ST WITHOUT 
BARE CRAG OR MOUNTAIN TAIRN OR BLASTED TREE 
OR PINE GROVE WHITHER WOODMAN NEVER CLOMB 
OR LONELY HOUSE LONG HELD THE WITCHES' HOME 
METHINKS WERE FITTER INSTRUMENTS FOR THEE 
COLERIDGE SIMPLY ABANDONED HIMSELF TO THE LAKES 
TO THE FIERCEST CRAGS OF THESE MOUNTAINS TO THE FIERCEST WEATHER 
HE WALKED HE CLIMBED AND HE SUFFERED 
HE DESCRIBED HOW HIS HANDS WOULD END UP BLEEDING 
HOW HIS EYES WENT RED WITH THE FIERCENESS OF THE WIND 
HOW WE SUFFERED BOILS HOW HE GOT TERRIBLE PAINS IN HIS LEGS 
THE IDEA BEHIND IT ALL WAS JUST TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE WORST THAT THE ELEMENTS COULD DO 
IN THE HOPE OF A KIND OF SALVATION I SUPPOSE 
WE'RE LEAVING BEHIND THE WILD RUGGED TERRAIN OF THE LAKE DISTRICT 
I'M TRAVELLING CROSS COUNTRY HEADING TOWARDS NORTHUMBERLAND 
FOR ME THIS ANCIENT LAND BUFFETED BY THE NORTH SEA GALES 
IS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING COASTLINES IN BRITAIN 
THE ISLAND OF LINDISFARNE 
IT'S JOINED TO THE MAINLAND BY A NARROW CAUSEWAY 
TWICE A DAY IT'S CUT OFF AS TIDES SWEEP ACROSS THESE MUD FLATS 
OVER THE CENTURIES FOOLHARDY TRAVELLERS HAVE DROWNED HERE 
IN THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETIES 
TWO YOUNG ARTISTS CAME HERE IN SEARCH OF INSPIRATION 
ONE WOULD LIVE TO ENJOY FAME AND FORTUNE 
WHILE THE OTHER WOULD DIE YOUNG AND BE FORGOTTEN 
TOGETHER THEIR GENIUS WOULD CHANGE THE FACE OF BRITISH LANDSCAPE PAINTING FOREVER 
THEIR NAMES WILLIAM TURNER AND THOMAS GIRTIN 
GIRTIN WAS THE FIRST TO COME HERE 
IT WAS ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX 
HE WAS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD HE'D JUST FINISHED AN APPRENTICESHIP IN LONDON 
GIRTIN HAD BEEN TUTORED IN THE STRICT ARTISTIC RULES OF THE DAY 
STIFLED BY CONVENTION HE TRAVELLED NORTH TO FIND FREEDOM 
AND FRESH INSPIRATION IN THE WILD SCENERY OF NORTHUMBERLAND 
GIRTIN WAS A REBEL A NATURAL BREAKER OF RULES 
HE THOUGHT THAT THE TRADITIONAL TEACHING ON HOW YOU SHOULD DRAW AND PAINT WAS COLD AND UNFEELING 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO DRAW EVERY PRECISE LITTLE DETAIL OF WHAT HE SAW 
INSTEAD HE WANTED TO GIVE AN IMPRESSION OF HOW HE FELT ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE 
AND SO HE INSISTED ON PAINTING IN THE OPEN AIR IN A VANTAGE POINT HERE 
AND WORKED OBSESSIVELY UNTIL HE'D CAPTURED THE MOOD OF THIS PLACE 
GIRTIN'S EPIC PAINTING SHOWS 
MAN DWARFED BY THE IMMENSITY OF THE LANDSCAPE 
HE'S NOT ATTEMPTING A PRECISE REPRODUCTION OF THE SCENE BEFORE HIM 
BUT A VISION OF IT SHAPED BY HIS OWN FEELINGS 
HE'S EXAGGERATED THE HEIGHT OF THE ROCKY OUTCROP 
DETAIL IS ABANDONED FOR LOOSE DRAMATIC BRUSHSTROKES 
WHEN IT WAS EXHIBITED SOME PEOPLE SAID HIS STYLE WAS LAZY EVEN THAT IT WAS UNFINISHED 
BUT OTHERS SAID GIRTIN BURST LIKE A METEOR UPON THE PUBLIC 
WITHIN WEEKS OF SEEING GIRTIN'S PAINTING 
WILLIAM TURNER SET OFF FOR LINDISFARNE 
DETERMINED TO OUTDO HIS FRIEND AND RIVAL 
IT WILL BE THE FIRST OF MANY TRIPS NORTH 
IN THIS WILD LANDSCAPE TURNER GAVE FULL REIN TO HIS EMOTIONS' 
A STORM IS BREWING 
DARK CLOUDS THREATEN TO ENVELOP THE SUNLIT SCENE 
THE TURBULENT NORTH SEA SWELLS AND CRASHES BATTERING THE ISLAND 
IN THE FOREGROUND TRAVELLERS STRUGGLE ASHORE 
AGAIN NATURE TOWERS OVER MANKIND 
GIRTIN AND TURNER CAME TO DEFINE THE GOLDEN AGE OF LANDSCAPE ART 
BUT WHILE TURNER'S CAREER BROUGHT HIM FAME AND FORTUNE 
GIRTIN'S WAS TRAGICALLY CUT SHORT 
PAINTING OUTSIDE IN ALL WEATHERS 
HE SUCCUMBED TO ASTHMA AND DIED JUST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD 
BUT IN HIS SHORT LIFE 
GIRTIN PAINTED SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL PICTURES OF THE NORTH 
AN INSPIRATION TO OTHER PAINTERS EVEN IF FORGOTTEN BY THE WORLD 
I WAS A TEENAGER WHEN I FIRST SAW A THOMAS GIRTIN WATERCOLOUR 
IT WAS FOR SALE FOR A FRACTION OF WHAT IT'D BE WORTH TODAY AS HE WASN'T PARTICULARLY FASHIONABLE 
I RATHER WISH I'D BOUGHT IT 
GIRTIN SEEMS TO HAVE FALLEN THROUGH THE NET OF HISTORY 
AND YET WHEN HE DIED MANY PEOPLE RANKED HIM ABOVE TURNER 
TURNER HIMSELF AT THE PEAK OF HIS FAME SAID 
IF TOM GIRTIN HAD LIVED I SHOULD HAVE STARVED 
I'M HEADING INTO YORKSHIRE WHAT THE YORKSHIRE PEOPLE CALL GOD'S OWN COUNTRY 
AND I THINK THE ONLY COUNTY THAT CLAIMS ITS OWN NATIONAL ANTHEM ON ILKLEY MOOR BAHT'AT 
ON ILKLEY MOOR BAHT'AT 
ACCORDING TO TRADITION THE SONG WAS CONCEIVED HERE AT THE COW AND CALF ROCKS ON ILKLEY MOOR 
IF THIS IS YORKSHIRE'S NATIONAL ANTHEM 
THEN BRASS BANDS ARE YORKSHIRE'S NATIONAL MUSIC 
ON ILKLEY MOOR BAHT'AT 
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT MEANS 
THIS BLOKE ON THE MOORS WITHOUT HIS HAT ON 
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE MUCH OF A SONG 
IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE OF YORKSHIRE 
AND THE LOOK OF YORKSHIRE DO YOU THINK THAT AFFECTS THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE AND THE MUSIC YOU PLAY 
PERHAPS THE WEATHER IT'S COLD 
IT'S CERTAINLY COLD UP HERE TODAY AND WE HAVEN'T GOT HATS ON 
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A VARIETY OF COUNTRYSIDE IN YORKSHIRE 
FROM THE PLAINS OF YORK BEING FLAT TO THE MOORS AT WHITBY SIDE 
OR LIKE HERE AROUND HERE THE PENNINES YOU KNOW THE BACKBONE OF ENGLAND 
IF YOU LIVE AND WERE BORN AND BRED IN THE BACKBONE OF ENGLAND THE BACKBONE IS THE MAIN PART IN'T IT 
HARD YES I WOULD SAY IT'S HARD BECAUSE OF THE INDUSTRIES THAT PEOPLE HAD TO WORK IN 
STONE QUARRYING COAL MINING TEXTILES 
AND I THINK ALL YOUR EMOTIONS CAN COME OUT IN YOUR MUSIC 
WHAT IS IT TO BE A YORKSHIREMAN 
WHAT IS IT TO BE A YORKSHIREMAN 
ER WELL TO BE BORN IN GOD'S OWN COUNTY 
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER IS THERE 
YOU CAN'T CLAIM TO BE A YORKSHIREMAN CAN YOU 
I'M FROM EAST CHEAM EXACTLY 
WEST LONDON IS WHERE I WAS BORN EXACTLY THAT'S NOT GOD'S COUNTY IS IT IT IS TO ME 
I'M WALKING ALONG THE CRAVEN FAULT 
A TWENTY TWO MILE GEOLOGICAL GASH IN THE LANDSCAPE 
WHICH RUNS FROM THE BORDERS OF CUMBRIA INTO THE YORKSHIRE DALES 
AT THE NORTHERN END OF THIS GREAT LIMESTONE GORGE 
IS ONE OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR SIGHTS IN BRITAIN' 
WOW 
THIS IS THE FAMOUS GORDALE SCAR 
SOMEWHERE AROUND FIFTY MAYBE SIXTY MILLION YEARS OLD 
IT USED TO HAVE A GREAT ROOF TO IT SO NOW THESE ARE LIKE THE WALLS OF A CRUMBLING BUILDING 
BUT ON A MASSIVE SCALE 
OVER THREE HUNDRED F. T. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WATER PLUNGING DOWN THE MIDDLE 
IT USED TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK 
WHEN THEY STOOD HERE WHERE I'M STANDING 
THAT THE SIDES WERE GOING TO FALL DOWN ANY MOMENT COLLAPSE ON TOP OF THEM 
PEOPLE CAME HERE WANTING TO BE AWESTRUCK 
TO EXPERIENCE A LANDSCAPE THAT HAD THE POWER TO INSPIRE TERROR 
THE POET THOMAS GRAY SAID HE COULD ONLY BEAR TO STAY HERE 
FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND EVEN THEN NOT WITHOUT SHUDDERING 
YOU'D THINK THIS PLACE WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE GIFT TO THE ARTIST 
THESE GREAT OVERPOWERING ROCKS 
THE WHOLE SCALE OF IT BUT THE FUNNY THING IS 
THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS UNPAINTABLE ALMOST TOO MAJESTIC 
TO BE IN COMPRESSED INTO A CANVAS UNTIL ONE PERSON PROVED THEM WRONG 
HIS NAME WAS JAMES WARD 
AND IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWELVE HE TRANSFORMED THE UNPAINTABLE 
INTO A TRIUMPH OF LANDSCAPE ART 
WARD CAPTURED THE SIGHT THAT SO TERRIFIED HIS FELLOW PAINTERS 
IN A MONUMENTAL PICTURE 
TWELVE F. T. HIGH FOURTEEN F. T. WIDE 
WARD REARRANGED ELEMENTS OF GORDALE SCAR 
TO PROVOKE THE STRONGEST EMOTIONAL RESPONSE 
BENEATH A SKY TURBULENT WITH STORM CLOUDS 
HE INCREASED ITS SCALE DEEPENING AND DARKENING THE CHASM 
HE MOVED THE WATERFALL INTO THE CENTRE 
TO PROVIDE A GLIMMER OF LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS 
AND ADDED A HERD OF COWS AND DEER 
EMERGING FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE CAVERN 
DOMINATED BY A GREAT WHITE BULL IN THE FOREGROUND 
THE PAINTING PROVED OVERWHELMING IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE 
WARD'S MASTERPIECE WAS TOO LARGE 
TO HANG IN THE HOME OF LORD RIBBLESDALE HIS PATRON 
IT ENDED UP IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM AND THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYWHERE TO PUT IT EITHER 
AND SO FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS IT WAS ROLLED UP AND LEFT IN A DANK CELLAR 
TO WARD'S FURY THE PICTURE WASN'T EXHIBITED IN HIS LIFETIME 
IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH BEFORE IT WAS FINALLY HUNG 
ON THE WALLS OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY 
THE PROBLEM WITH LANDSCAPE THAT COULD THRILL AND TERRIFY THE TOURIST 
WAS THAT IT TOOK SUCH AN EFFORT TO GET TO 
THERE WERE A GROWING NUMBER OF VISITORS IN THE EARLY EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS 
WHO WANTED SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS STRENUOUS 
MANY OF THEM HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY TO THE TOWN OF KNARESBOROUGH 
IN THE GORGE OF THE RIVER NIDD 
A TRIP TO KNARESBOROUGH WAS A PACKAGE TOUR OF THE PICTURESQUE 
ALL THAT FASHIONABLE FELL WALKING AND CRAG CLIMBING 
WAS DIRTY AND WET AND COLD AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS 
BUT IF YOU WANTED TO EXPERIENCE THE EXCITEMENT OF THE ROMANTIC VISION THEN YOU COULD COME HERE 
YOU COULD SAY THIS IS WHERE THE UNRULY SPIRIT OF ROMANTICISM WAS TAMED 
KNARESBOROUGH WAS THE ROMANTIC NORTH IN MINIATURE 
IT HAD ALL THE PICTURESQUE FAVOURITES A TUMBLING WEIR 
A RIVER SHADED BY TREES 
A CRAGGY GORGE THE RUINS OF AN ANCIENT CASTLE 
AND IT EVEN HAD A CAVE REPUTED ONCE TO HAVE BEEN HOME TO A LOCAL WITCH 
WELL DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT 
IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY KNARESBOROUGH WAS A ROMANTIC THEME PARK 
PERFECT FOR THOSE WHO PREFERRED THEIR NATURE A LITTLE LESS SAVAGE 
THE BIGGEST LURE WAS THE DROPPING WELL 
WHERE AS THOUGH BY MAGIC EVERYDAY OBJECTS WOULD BE TURNED TO STONE 
SO WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IT'S JUST WATER DRIPPING DOWN ON THEM THAT'S RIGHT 
AND IT TURNS INTO STONE 
IT'S THE MINERAL CONTENT OF THE WATER REALLY 
THEY'RE REALLY HARD WHEN THEY'RE FINISHED THEY ARE 
IT'S NOT JUST TEDDY BEARS YOU'VE GOT BASEBALL GLOVE A GLOVE 
A HANDBAG A HANDBAG THAT WAS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HANDBAG 
NO IT WAS YEAH GO ON IT WAS YEAH TRULY TRULY 
ERM SO THEY USED TO WALK TO THE TOP OF THE WELL 
AND HANG THINGS OVER 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THERE WAS A COUPLE ON THE WAY TO YORK RACES 
AND THEY HUNG A TOP HAT AND A LADY'S BONNET 
THEY NEVER COLLECTED THEM AND THEY'RE STILL THERE NOW 
THEY'RE ENORMOUS THAT ONE IT'S VAST IT IS YES IT IS 
THAT'S A TOP HAT THAT'S A TOP HAT ON THE RIGHT IS THE LADY'S BONNET 
AND THEY'VE BEEN THERE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS OR SO 
I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT I CAN'T DO THE MATHS EITHER I'VE A GLOVE 
I LOST THE OTHER ONE I'VE GOT ONE GLOVE WHICH I CAN SACRIFICE TO THE WELL 
RIGHT O. K. NICE ONE 
THERE WE ARE IT SEEMS SAFE 
COME BACK IN SIX MONTHS 
HEADING SOUTHWEST I'M ENTERING BRONTE COUNTRY 
OH THE SNOWY WASTE 
ACROSS THE BLASTED HEATH ONE 
OW 
I LOVE IT ON TOP OF THE MOORS 
YOU FEEL MORE FREE I THINK ON THESE HILLS THAN IN REAL MOUNTAINS 
WHICH ARE ALWAYS SORT OF LOURING OVER YOU 
HERE YOU REALLY ARE ON TOP OF THE WORLD IT MAKES YOU 
IT MAKES YOUR SPIRIT SOAR 
I WISH I WERE OUT OF DOORS 
HALF SAVAGE AND HARDY AND FREE 
AND LAUGHING AT INJURIES NOT MADDENING UNDER THEM 
I'M SURE I SHOULD BE MYSELF 
WERE I ONCE AMONG THE HEATHER ON THOSE HILLS 
WUTHERING HEIGHTS BY KATE BUSH 
OUT ON THE WILY WINDY MOORS 
WE'D ROLL AND FALL IN GREEN 
EMILY BRONTE'S STORY OF THE TRAGIC LOVE AFFAIR BETWEEN CATHERINE EARNSHAW 
AND THE BROODING HERO HEATHCLIFF 
WOULD CHANGE THE WAY WE FEEL ABOUT THE YORKSHIRE MOORS FOREVER 
WUTHERING WUTHERING WUTHERING HEIGHTS HEATHCLIFF 
IT'S ME I'M CATHY I'VE COME HOME NOW 
THIS GREAT OUTCROP OF ROCK IS KNOWN IN WUTHERING HEIGHTS AS PENNISTON CRAG 
IT'S THE SECRET MEETING PLACE OF CATHY AND HEATHCLIFF 
AND THIS IS THE FAIRY CAVE 
LEGEND HAS IT THAT IF YOU CRAWL THROUGH HERE YOU'LL BE MARRIED WITHIN A YEAR 
WUTHERING HEIGHTS SHOCKED VICTORIAN READERS WITH ITS VIOLENT AND PASSIONATE PORTRAYAL OF LOVE 
YET EMILY BRONTE WAS A SHY YOUNG WOMAN 
WHO LED A SHELTERED LIFE AND NEVER MARRIED 
LIKE ALL THE ARTISTS AND WRITERS 
WHO OPENED OUR EYES TO THE WILD BEAUTY OF THE NORTH 
SHE FOUND A SPECIAL KIND OF FREEDOM IN THIS LANDSCAPE 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN WANDERING ON THESE MOORS THAT INSPIRED 
EMILY'S IMAGINATION AND LED TO THAT PASSIONATE AND EMOTIONAL WRITING 
HER ELDER SISTER CHARLOTTE UNDERSTOOD IT 
SHE WROTE ONCE THAT EMILY LOVED THE MOORS 
OUT OF A SULLEN HOLLOW ON A LIVID HILLSIDE 
SHE SAID EMILY COULD MAKE AN EDEN 
JOIN DAVID DIMBLEBY NEXT WEEK 
WHEN HE'LL BE TRAVELLING THROUGH CONSTABLE COUNTRY 
EXPLORING THE MEADOWS AND WOODLANDS OF SUFFOLK 
FLOATING ABOVE THE FENS 
AND SAILING THE NORFOLK BROADS 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
