ARRESTED FOR SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH A CHILD UNDER SIXTEEN ABDUCTION OF TWO GIRLS 
PART OF A RARE OPERATION AGAINST A HIDDEN CRIME 
THE GROOMING OF BRITISH CHILDREN INTO PROSTITUTION 
CHILDREN ARE SEXUALLY ABUSED AND BRUTALISED AND WE'RE NOT RESPONDING 
OFTEN IT'S THE CHILDREN WHO GET BLAMED NOT THE PIMPS 
THEIR LACK OF LIMBS COMPELS THEM TO DEAL WITH LIFE'S PROBLEMS IN WAYS THAT ARE UTTERLY DIFFERENT FROM OURS 
BUT NONETHELESS THE TECHNIQUES THEY'VE DEVELOPED 
ARE SPECTACULARLY SUCCESSFUL 
SNAKES HAVE ONE OF THE SIMPLEST OF BODY SHAPES 
ESSENTIALLY JUST A LONG THIN TUBE 
BUT THEY HAVE SOME REMARKABLY EFFECTIVE WAYS OF GETTING AROUND 
THEY CAN CLIMB A TREE SIMPLY BY EMBRACING ITS TRUNK 
SOME CAN FLATTEN THEIR BODIES 
SO THAT THEY CATCH THE AIR BENEATH THEM AND GLIDE 
BY HITCHING UP THEIR UNDERSIDES 
THEY CAN INCH THEMSELVES FORWARD IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
A SINUOUS WRIGGLE ENABLES THEM TO SKATE ACROSS LOOSE SAND 
AND THE SAME ACTION WORKS EQUALLY WELL IN WATER 
THERE SOME SWIM CLOSE TO THE SURFACE 
OTHERS EXPLORE THE DEPTHS AND CAN STAY UNDERWATER FOR HOURS ON END 
ONE BELIEVE IT OR NOT CAN JUMP 
SO LEGLESSNESS HARDLY SEEMS SUCH A HANDICAP 
BUT HOW DID SNAKES GET THAT WAY 
WELL THEIR REMOTE ANCESTORS ONE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO 
AT THE TIME OF THE DINOSAURS DID HAVE LEGS 
RATHER LIKE TODAY'S LIZARDS 
DOUBTLESS THEY WERE VERY EFFECTIVE RUNNERS 
BUT SOME ALSO STARTED TO BURROW IN SEARCH OF PREY 
BELOW GROUND LEGS ARE A HINDRANCE 
AND OVER GENERATIONS THEY BECAME SMALLER 
TODAY BURROWING LIZARDS SUCH AS SKINKS 
SEEM TO BE GOING THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS 
MANY HAVE TINY BUT RECOGNISABLE LEGS 
IN OTHERS THE LIMBS HAVE BECOME NOTHING MORE THAN FUNCTIONLESS FLAPS 
IN THIS BURROWING LIZARD THE PROCESS HAS GONE EVEN FURTHER 
THE ANIMAL STILL HAS THE FACE OF A LIZARD 
BUT ITS LEGS HAVE DISAPPEARED TOTALLY 
IT SEEMS THAT THE ANCESTRAL SNAKES WENT THROUGH JUST SUCH A PROCESS 
WAY BACK IN GEOLOGICAL HISTORY SOME NINETY FIVE MILLION YEARS AGO 
SO WHAT DID THESE VERY FIRST SNAKES LOOK LIKE 
WELL THE ANSWER CAN BE FOUND IN ASIAN JUNGLES 
IN AMERICAN WOODLANDS AND GARDENS 
AND EVEN IN FLOWERPOTS LIKE THIS 
IT MAY LOOK LIKE AN EARTHWORM BUT ACTUALLY IT'S A FLOWER POT SNAKE 
AND IT'S COMPLETELY BLIND 
IT DOESN'T NEED TO SEE BECAUSE IT SPENDS ALL ITS LIFE UNDERGROUND 
I'LL PUT IT BACK IN ITS FLOWERPOT 
PUT A FLOWER ON TOP AND IT WILL LIVE PERFECTLY HAPPILY THERE 
IN THIS FLOWERPOT ALL BY ITSELF PROVIDING IT HAS ENOUGH FOOD 
AND THERE'S A SURPRISING AMOUNT FOR A SMALL SNAKE TO EAT UNDERGROUND 
ANT LARVAE FOR EXAMPLE 
THESE EARLY LEGLESS REPTILES 
FLOURISHED AND REMAINED UNDERGROUND FOR A LONG TIME 
THEN AROUND FIFTY MILLION YEARS AGO SOME OF THEM RETURNED TO THE SURFACE 
WHY WELL BY THIS TIME THE DINOSAURS HAD DISAPPEARED 
AND THE EARLY MAMMALS HAD ARRIVED 
THEY WERE MORE NUTRITIOUS THAN BEETLES AND WORMS 
SO THE SNAKES BEGAN TO CATCH THEM INSTEAD 
AND BECAME SO GOOD AT DOING SO THAT TODAY 
THEY ARE AMONG THE MOST SKILFUL HUNTERS ON EARTH 
HERE IN NORTH AMERICA THERE'S A SNAKE 
THAT COMBINES ITS GREAT SPEED AND EXTRAORDINARY SENSES 
IN A REMARKABLE HUNTING STRATEGY 
WE ARE ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND 
A TIMBER RATTLESNAKE 
THE MORNING SUN HAS WARMED ITS BODY 
GIVING IT ENERGY AND IT STARTS TO MOVE 
IT'S SEARCHING FOR A PLACE WHERE IT CAN CONCEAL ITSELF 
AND WAIT FOR PREY TO COME WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE 
A LITTLE CHIPMUNK IT'S IN NO DANGER YET 
THE RATTLESNAKE CAN'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO CHASE AND CATCH IT 
BUT SMALL MAMMALS TEND TO USE THE SAME PATHS 
AS THEY RUN OVER THE FOREST FLOOR 
AND THEY LEAVE BEHIND A FAINT TRAIL OF SCENT 
THE RATTLESNAKE CAN DETECT THAT SCENT WITH ITS TONGUE 
IT CAN ALSO LOCATE THE WARM BLOODED CHIPMUNK IF IT'S NEARBY 
WITH HEAT DETECTORS IN A PAIR OF PITS BENEATH ITS EYES 
AS IT MOVES IT CAREFULLY HOLDS ITS RATTLE ABOVE THE GROUND 
SO IT MAKES NO NOISE 
IT'S CHOSEN THE PLACE TO WAIT AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS TREE STUMP 
ITS COLOURATION MATCHES THE GROUND SO CLOSELY 
IT NEEDS NO FURTHER CONCEALMENT 
NOW IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME 
SEEING A RATTLESNAKE ACTUALLY CATCHING ITS PREY 
IS A VERY VERY DIFFICULT THING TO OBSERVE 
IN FACT SOME SCIENTISTS HAVE WATCHED RATTLESNAKES FOR YEARS 
WITHOUT SEEING THAT PARTICULAR CRUCIAL MOMENT 
BUT WE HAVE A CHANCE PARTLY BECAUSE RATTLESNAKES ARE AMBUSH HUNTERS 
SO WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO PUT UP OUR GEAR 
AND PARTLY BECAUSE IN THAT GEAR 
WE'VE GOT THE VERY LATEST IN SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT 
THERE ARE REMOTELY CONTROLLED CAMERAS 
AND INFRA RED LIGHTS ON STANDS 
AND THERE ARE MOTION DETECTORS 
THAT WILL SWITCH ON THE CAMERAS IF ANYTHING MOVES 
SO I NEEDN'T WAIT ALONGSIDE 
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS THE CAMERAS WILL SWITCH ON AUTOMATICALLY 
LATER I CHECK THE REPLAY 
THERE'S A MOUSE 
JUST ALONG THAT LOG 
THAT OBVIOUSLY CAME TO NOTHING 
BUT THE CAMERAS HAVE STARTED RECORDING AGAIN 
AND THE SNAKE IS MOVING 
HE'S CHECKING OUT THE TRAIL WITH HIS TONGUE 
SEE THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THAT MOUSE WAS RUNNING 
IT'S PITCH DARK AND THE MOUSE CLEARLY HAS NO IDEA THAT THE SNAKE IS THERE 
BUT THE SNAKE IS WELL AWARE OF THE MOUSE 
THANKS NO DOUBT TO THOSE HEAT DETECTING PITS 
THE SNAKE STRIKES BY SUDDENLY STRAIGHTENING THE CURVE IN ITS NECK 
BUT AT THE MOMENT THE MOUSE IS NOT WITHIN RANGE 
HE'S WORKED OUT THAT THAT IS THE PATH 
ALONG WHICH THE MICE RUN 
AND HE'S GETTING HIMSELF PROPERLY ADJUSTED 
SO HE CAN STRIKE WHEN HE NEXT GETS A CHANCE 
NOW ONCE AGAIN WAITING 
THAT'S WHAT SNAKES ARE SO GOOD AT 
OH MY GOODNESS 
THAT'S A DEAD MOUSE ALL RIGHT 
SLOW DOWN THAT SHOT 
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SNAKE STABS THE MOUSE JUST ONCE 
AFTER THREE CONVULSIVE KICKS THE MOUSE IS DEAD 
SNAKE IS MOVING AGAIN 
HE'S GOING BACK NOW 
TO LOOK FOR THE ONE THAT HE KNOWS IS DEAD BACK THERE 
WHERE IS IT 
AH NOW IT LOOKS AS THOUGH HE'S REALLY GOT IT 
THAT'S HIS DINNER 
AND THAT CAN LAST HIM 
FOR THREE WEEKS 
FOUR WEEKS IF NECESSARY 
RATTLESNAKES ARE AMONG THE LEAST OBTRUSIVE INHABITANTS 
OF THE FORESTS OF NORTH AMERICA 
AND THEY'RE PROBABLY FAR MORE NUMEROUS THAN MANY PEOPLE REALISE 
LIKE MANY OTHER ANIMALS SNAKES USE THEIR NOSTRILS TO DETECT SMELLS 
BUT THE MOST SENSITIVE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION 
ABOUT THE WORLD AROUND THEM 
COMES FROM THAT CONSTANTLY FLICKERING TONGUE 
WITH THIS A SNAKE GATHERS MOLECULES FROM THE AIR 
AND CARRIES THEM BACK FOR EVALUATION 
TO A PAIR OF EXTREMELY SENSITIVE ORGANS IN THE ROOF OF ITS MOUTH 
TO SEE JUST HOW IMPORTANT SCENT CAN BE TO A SNAKE 
I'VE COME HERE TO CARNAC ISLAND JUST OFF THE COAST OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA 
IT'S HOME TO A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGHLY VENOMOUS TIGER SNAKES 
SNAKES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED HERE FOR MANY YEARS 
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ODD ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION 
MANY OF THEM HAVE DAMAGED HEADS AND SOME OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY BLIND 
LIKE THIS ONE 
AND YET PUZZLINGLY IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE BLIND 
THEY ALL APPEAR TO BE VERY WELL FED 
SO HOW DO THEIR HEADS GET DAMAGED 
AND HOW IN THAT CONDITION WHEN THEY CAN'T SEE ANYTHING 
CAN THEY CATCH ALL THE PREY THEY NEED 
THE SNAKES OF COURSE ARE NOT THE ONLY INHABITANTS OF THE ISLAND 
IT'S ALSO HOME FOR A LARGE COLONY OF SILVER GULLS 
THE GULLS BREED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 
SO THEIR CHICKS ARE A SOURCE OF FOOD FOR THE SNAKES THAT NEVER ENDS 
IN FACT THE SNAKES EAT PRETTY WELL NOTHING ELSE 
BUT THE SNAKES DON'T GET IT ALL THEIR OWN WAY 
THE GULLS ARE VALIANT DEFENDERS OF THEIR NESTS AND THEIR CHICKS 
THEIR STABBING BEAKS ARE POWERFUL 
SHARP AND STRONG AND THE GULLS ALWAYS GO FOR THE SNAKE'S HEAD 
ONE IN TEN OF THE SNAKES ARE TOTALLY BLINDED 
TIGER SNAKES DON'T HAVE THOSE HEAT SENSITIVE PITS 
THAT RATTLESNAKES HAVE 
SO THESE BLINDED HUNTERS ARE GUIDED ENTIRELY BY THEIR FORKED TONGUE 
IT'S A SUPERB DIRECTION FINDING DEVICE 
THE SNAKE CAN MEASURE THE STRENGTH OF THE SMELL SEPARATELY 
ON EACH OF THE TWO FORKS OF ITS TONGUE 
AND IF IT WISHES TO FOLLOW UP A SMELL THEN IT SIMPLY DETECTS THE ONE 
WHICH HAS THE STRONGER SMELL AND GOES IN THAT DIRECTION 
GULL CHICKS ARE AN IDEAL PREY FOR A BLINDED SNAKE 
BECAUSE THEY ARE PROGRAMMED TO STAY ON THEIR NESTS 
ONCE A SNAKE HAS LOCATED IT A CHICK IS DOOMED 
SNAKES IT MUST BE ADMITTED HAVE HAD A BAD REPUTATION 
EVER SINCE ONE APPEARED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN 
BUT IN REALITY EVEN THE MOST AGGRESSIVE VENOMOUS SNAKE 
WILL AVOID BITING A HUMAN BEING IF IT CAN 
WHY WASTE VENOM AND RISK A VIOLENT RETRIBUTION 
BY BITING SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO EAT 
TO PREVENT MISUNDERSTANDING 
MOST VENOMOUS SNAKES WARN OTHER ANIMALS INCLUDING HUMAN BEINGS 
TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY 
SO SNAKES DO THAT WITH SOUND 
OTHERS SUCH AS COBRAS GIVE A VISUAL SIGNAL 
BY EXPANDING THE SKIN AROUND THEIR HEADS TO FORM A CONSPICUOUS HOOD 
THE THREAT OF A BITE 
IS FAR BETTER DEFENCE FOR A SNAKE THAN THE BITE ITSELF 
HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME SNAKES 
THAT NOT ONLY USE THEIR VENOM TO KILL THEIR PREY 
BUT HAVE ALSO FOUND A WAY OF USING IT 
TO DETER THEIR ENEMIES WITHOUT EVEN BITING THEM 
THIS MOZAMBIQUE COBRA HAS A VERY SPECIAL WAY OF DOING THAT 
TO DEMONSTRATE THIS WITH SOME DEGREE OF SAFETY 
I'M GOING TO WEAR THIS VISOR WHICH HAS BEEN COATED WITH A SUBSTANCE 
THAT TURNS PINK IN CONTACT WITH VENOM 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
IT'S WATCHING ME WAITING TO SEE IF I GET TOO CLOSE FOR ITS LIKING 
VENOM SPURTS FROM ITS FANGS 
AS IT SPITS IT TURNS ITS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE 
SO THAT THE JETS HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF HITTING MY EYES 
WELL I WAS WELL AND TRULY SPRAYED 
EVERY ONE OF THOSE PINK DOTS IS A BEAD OF VENOM 
AND IF ANY ONE OF THEM HAD GONE IN MY EYE 
I WOULD BE NOW BLIND AND IN EXTREME PAIN 
SO IT'S A FAIR WARNING FROM THAT SNAKE TO ME NOT TO GET ANY CLOSER 
AND I DARESAY IF I DID 
I WOULD DESERVE WHAT I WOULD GET WHICH WOULD BE A BITE 
I HAVE NO INTENTION OF DOING THAT 
ON THE OTHER HAND SOME SNAKES WHICH MAY APPEAR TO BE VENOMOUS 
ARE IN REALITY QUITE HARMLESS 
THESE TWO SNAKES LOOK VERY VERY SIMILAR AND THEY BOTH OCCUR HERE 
IN THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES 
SO YOU ARE QUITE LIKELY TO MEET ONE OR THE OTHER HERE 
ONE OF THEM HOWEVER IS HARMLESS IT'S CALLED A KING SNAKE 
THE OTHER ONE IS A CORAL SNAKE AND HIGHLY VENOMOUS 
ONE BITE CERTAIN DEATH 
THE QUESTION IS WHICH IS WHICH 
WELL THE KEY LIES IN THE ORDER OF THE COLOUR RINGS 
PEOPLE HERE HAVE A LOCAL SAYING RED AND BLACK VENOM LACK 
RED AND YELLOW CAN KILL A FELLOW 
THIS ONE HAS RED AND BLACK 
SO I GUESS THAT'S A KING SNAKE 
WE'LL SEE 
SO FAR SO GOOD 
YEAH THIS IS A KING SNAKE 
AND WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SNAKE IT IS 
A REALLY LOVELY REPTILE 
THE KING SNAKE PRETENDS TO BE VENOMOUS WHEN IT'S NOT 
AND THERE'S ANOTHER SNAKE THAT PRETENDS TO BE DEAD WHEN IT ISN'T 
SNAKES BEING COLD BLOODED SEEM TO RELISH THE WARMTH OF SUN BAKED ROADS 
AND OFTEN BASK ON THEM AND AS A RESULT OF COURSE MANY GET RUN OVER 
BUT THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS EXACTLY WHAT THEY SEEM 
HE LOOKS FAIRLY DEAD 
BUT IN FACT THIS HOG NOSED SNAKE IS PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT 
HE WAS JUST FEIGNING DEATH 
SO THAT THINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
INTERESTED IN A LIVING SNAKE 
ARE NOT AND WHAT'S MORE 
HE'S PRODUCED RATHER A REMARKABLE SMELL 
IN FACT THE SMELL AS IT WERE 
OF ROTTING FLESH 
MAYBE HE WAS PRETENDING TOO THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY DEAD BUT DECOMPOSING 
VERY CONVINCING OFF YOU GO 
THE LACK OF LIMBS THAT MIGHT SEEM TO US TO BE SUCH A HUGE HANDICAP 
HAS NOT STOPPED SNAKES FROM GETTING AROUND IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS 
AND NEITHER DOES IT PREVENT THEM FROM TACKLING ALL KINDS OF MEALS 
THIS SOUTH AFRICAN SNAKE 
HAS BECOME A SPECIALIST IN SWALLOWING A PARTICULARLY AWKWARD MOUTHFUL 
IT'S AS ACCOMPLISHED A TREE CLIMBER AS YOU'LL FIND AMONG SNAKES 
THE TREES IT FREQUENTS 
ALSO HOLD COLONIES OF MASKED WEAVER BIRDS 
THAT SUSPEND THEIR NESTS FROM THE VERY TIP OF THE BRANCHES 
BUT THE SNAKE IS A SKILLED ENOUGH CLIMBER TO REACH THEM 
THE WEAVER BIRDS KNOW IT WELL AND RECOGNISE IT AS A THREAT 
IT'S WELL ACCUSTOMED TO THESE ATTACKS 
THESE DEFENDERS HOWEVER ARE JUST TOO DETERMINED AND IT RETREATS 
BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE UP ALTOGETHER 
THIS NEST IS UNGUARDED 
AND THIS IS WHAT THE SNAKE IS AFTER THE EGGS 
EACH IS SEVERAL TIMES BIGGER THAN THE SNAKE'S HEAD 
BUT ITS JAWS ARE LINKED BY LIGAMENTS THAT ARE AMAZINGLY ELASTIC 
ONCE THE EGG IS ENGULFED BY THE SNAKE'S JAWS 
POWERFUL THROAT MUSCLES PUSH IT DOWN ITS GULLET 
MOVING X. RAYS ENABLE US TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING 
SOON THE EGG REACHES A PART OF THE BACKBONE 
THAT HAS DOWNWARD POINTING SPINES ON IT 
THE SNAKE ARCHES ITS BACKBONE AND THEN SQUEEZES 
THE SHELL CRACKS AND THE SPINES ON THE BACKBONE SLIT THE MEMBRANE 
THE SHELL IS CRUSHED 
AND RICH NUTRITIOUS YOLK FLOWS INTO THE SNAKE'S GUT 
THEN WHAT'S LEFT OF THE SHELL IS REGURGITATED 
BUT THAT OF COURSE WAS A SMALL MEAL 
SOME SNAKES CAN TACKLE MUCH BIGGER MEALS THAN THAT 
AN AFRICAN ROCK PYTHON ONE OF THE BIGGEST OF ALL SNAKES 
THAT CAN GROW OVER SEVEN METRES TWENTY FEET LONG 
AND IT IS EATING AN ANTELOPE 
IT TOO HAS AN ELASTIC LIGAMENT CONNECTING ITS JAWS 
IT KILLED THE ANTELOPE NOT WITH VENOM 
BUT BY SQUEEZING IT SO TIGHTLY THAT IT WAS UNABLE TO BREATHE 
A PYTHON'S TEETH CAN'T CUT OR RIP 
IT HAS TO SWALLOW ITS PREY WHOLE OR NOT AT ALL 
AND THAT MAY TAKE A DAY OR MORE 
WITHOUT LIMBS THE PYTHON CAN'T PUSH THE ANTELOPE DOWN ITS THROAT 
INSTEAD IT HITCHES ITS JAWS DIAGONALLY BACK AND FORTH 
SO THAT THEY AS IT WERE WALK OVER THE PREY 
ITS TUBE LIKE BODY HAS TO STRETCH SO EXTREMELY 
TO ACCOMMODATE SUCH A GIGANTIC MEAL 
THAT ITS FLANKS HAVE TORN BUT SUCH INJURIES HEAL VERY QUICKLY 
THE LAST OF THE ANTELOPE ITS HOOVES ARE ABOUT TO DISAPPEAR 
GONE 
THE PYTHON WILL NOW HIDE ITSELF AWAY 
AND BEGIN THE LONG PROCESS OF DIGESTION 
EVERYTHING WILL BE DISSOLVED SKIN HAIR HOOVES EVEN HORNS 
THIS PYTHON WILL NOT NEED TO EATAGAIN FOR A YEAR OR MORE 
WHEREVER IT'S WARM AND THERE ARE ANIMALS OF SOME KIND 
THERE WILL BE SNAKES TO HUNT THEM 
NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT THE CONDITIONS 
AND HOW AWKWARD THE MOUTHFUL 
CRABS ARE IN PLENTIFUL SUPPLY IN THIS MANGROVE SWAMP 
THERE MUST BE FIFTY ON ANY ONE OF THESE TREES AROUND ME 
THEY'RE ALL UP THERE WAITING FOR THE TIDE TO GO OUT 
SO THAT THEY CAN FEED IN THE MUD BELOW 
SO THERE IS A MEAL FOR A SNAKE HERE BUT CRABS ARE NOT EASY TO TACKLE 
THEY'RE STRONG ARMOUR PLATED AND COVERED IN SPINES 
FOR A SNAKE TO TACKLE ONE OF THESE 
WOULD BE LIKE ME TRYING TO EAT A LOBSTER TWICE THE SIZE OF MY HEAD 
WITH MY HANDS TIED BEHIND MY BACK 
BUT THERE IS A SNAKE THAT KNOWS HOW TO DO SO 
THE CRABS CLING TO THE ARCHING STRUTS OF THE MANGROVES 
TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF PREDATORY FISH 
BUT AS THE TIDE RETREATS IT BECOMES SAFE FOR THEM TO CLIMB DOWN 
AND START LOOKING FOR SUCH EDIBLE BITS 
AS THE TIDE HAS LEFT BEHIND ON THE MUD 
FOR THE MOMENT THEY'RE SAFE BUT SOON THE SUN WILL SET 
THEN THE SNAKES WILL COME OUT OF THEIR BURROWS 
THEY HUNT IN THE DARKNESS 
BUT WE'LL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THEM WITH OUR INFRA RED CAMERAS 
IT'S NOW VERY DARK INDEED 
AND THE SNAKE HAS TO FIND ITS WAY AROUND ENTIRELY BY TOUCH AND SMELL 
FINDING CRABS IS NOT DIFFICULT 
THEY SWARM ALL OVER THE MUD 
AND THE SNAKE IS ALMOST BOUND TO ENCOUNTER ONE 
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER 
THE SNAKE IS ARMED WITH VENOM 
AND HAS SHORT STRONG FANGS WHICH CAN PIERCE A CRAB'S SHELL AND STUN IT 
BUT THAT'S ONLY HALF THE PROBLEM 
IT'S WHAT IT DOES AFTER IT'S CAUGHT ITS CRAB 
THAT SETS IT APART FROM ALL OTHER SNAKES 
IT HAS IT 
NOW WHAT 
THE CRAB IS SO LARGE THAT THE SNAKE CAN'T SWALLOW IT WHOLE 
SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY THE SNAKE DISMEMBERS THE CRAB 
EACH LEG CONTAINS NUTRITIOUS MUSCLE 
BUT THE CRAB'S ARMOURED BODY IS SIMPLY DISCARDED 
TOO DIFFICULT 
THERE ARE HARD SHELLED CREATURES IN FRESH WATERS AS WELL AS IN SALT 
NOT NEARLY AS MANY 
BUT SUFFICIENT NUMBER FOR SOME SNAKES TO SPECIALISE IN EATING THEM 
AND IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES MANY RIVERS CONTAIN CRAYFISH 
LIKE CRABS THEY HAVE A HARD PROTECTIVE SHELL 
AND THEY HAVE PARTICULARLY POWERFUL PINCERS AS WELL 
THE QUEEN SNAKE HOWEVER EATS CRAYFISH AND NOTHING ELSE 
BUT NOT JUST ANY CRAYFISH 
IT'S VERY SELECTIVE 
CRAYFISH AS THEY GROW SHED THEIR ARMOUR 
EVERY THREE TO FOUR WEEKS A SPLIT APPEARS ACROSS THE BACK OF ITS SHELL 
THE OLD SHELL HINGES AWAY 
AND THE CRAYFISH HAULS ITSELF OUT AND EXPANDS ITS BODY WHICH IS SOFT 
IT'S NOW THAT THE SNAKE HAS ITS CHANCE 
A NEWLY MOULTED CRAYFISH LOOKS MUCH THE SAME 
BUT IT GIVES OFF DIFFERENT CHEMICALS 
THAT THE SNAKE CAN DETECT IN THE WATER WITH ITS TONGUE 
AND FROM SOME DISTANCE AWAY 
IT CAN SWALLOW THIS CRAYFISH BECAUSE SINCE IT'S NEWLY MOULTED 
IT'S AS SOFT AS A BOILED EGG 
ON OCCASION SNAKES HAVE TO GRAPPLE NOT ONLY WITH THEIR PREY 
BUT WITH ONE ANOTHER IN DISPUTES OVER MATES AND TERRITORY 
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST FORMIDABLE THE KING COBRA 
HIGHLY VENOMOUS AND ABOUT FOUR METRES FOURTEEN FEET LONG 
DISPUTES BETWEEN RIVAL MALE KING COBRAS 
ARE POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS INDEED FOR THIS SPECIES SPECIALISES 
IN EATING OTHER KINDS OF SNAKES 
SO THEY OBSERVE STRICT RULES IN THEIR FIGHTS 
WHICH PROHIBIT THE USE OF THEIR LETHAL BITE 
SLOWED DOWN IT'S A PERFORMANCE FULL OF GRACE AS EACH CONTESTANT STRIVES 
NOT TO KILL HIS OPPONENT BUT SIMPLY TO SLAM HIM TO THE GROUND 
THE DEFEATED MALE LEAVES THE ARENA AND NO HARM HAS BEEN DONE 
SNAKES MUST ALSO FIND A WAY 
OF PREVENTING THEIR COURTSHIP FROM BECOMING LETHAL 
THIS IS A CALIFORNIAN KING SNAKE A MALE 
HE HAS DETECTED THE SCENT OF A FEMALE READY TO MATE 
LIKE ALL SNAKES HIS EYESIGHT IS NOT GOOD 
BUT HE CAN TELL FROM THE TASTE OF THE AIR THAT SHE'S CLOSE BY 
IN FACT SHE IS WITHIN INCHES 
FOR SOME TIME THE TWO FOLLOW ONE ANOTHER NOSE TO TAIL 
THE MALE BEGINS TO CARESS HER 
SENSUALLY JERKING AND ROCKING HIS BODY AS HE HOLDS HER CLOSE 
HE HAS A PAIR OF SEXUAL ORGANS 
ONE OF WHICH CAN PROJECT TO THE LEFT AND THE OTHER TO THE RIGHT 
SO NO MATTER WHICH SIDE OF HIM SHE HAPPENS TO LIE HE CAN REACH HER 
AT LAST UNION IS ACHIEVED 
THEY MAY REMAIN TOGETHER FOR SEVERAL HOURS 
IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME THE FEMALE WILL LAY A CLUTCH OF EGGS 
IT MAY TAKE SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS FOR THEM TO HATCH 
BUT THE REGIONS WHERE MOST SNAKES LIVE ARE WARM ENOUGH 
FOR THEM TO DEVELOP WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM THE PARENTS 
COBRAS LAY THEM ON THE GROUND IN THE LEAF LITTER 
THEIR SOFT PARCHMENT LIKE SHELL IS EASILY SPLIT WHEN PUSHED FROM WITHIN 
THE FRONT END OF A COBRA HATCHLING IS QUITE CAPABLE OF GIVING A BITE 
EVEN WHILE THE BACK END IS STILL WITHIN THE SHELL 
THEIR FANGS MAY BE SMALL 
BUT SINCE IT ONLY TAKES A TINY DROP OF COBRA VENOM TO KILL AN ANIMAL 
THESE YOUNGSTERS CAN BE AS LETHAL AS THEIR PARENTS 
THEY ALREADY HAVE THAT CHARACTERISTIC WARNING SIGNAL THE HOOD 
NOT ALL SNAKES LAY THEIR EGGS 
IN SOME SPECIES THE FEMALE RETAINS THEM WITHIN HER BODY 
UNTIL THEY'RE READY TO HATCH SO SHE GIVES BIRTH TO LIVE YOUNG 
THE MARSHES OF NORTHERN ARGENTINA 
HOME TO ONE OF THE LARGEST OF LIVE BEARING SNAKES THE ANACONDA 
THIS IS A FEMALE AND SHE'S HEAVILY PREGNANT 
IT'S MORNING AND SHE'S CHILLY 
SO SHE MOVES OUT OF THE WATER 
AND ON TO THE SWAMP TO WARM HERSELF IN THE SUN 
SLOWLY THE DAY BEGINS TO WARM UP 
NOW IT'S GETTING A LITTLE TOO HOT FOR HER SO SHE MOVES BACK 
TO THE WATER TO COOL OFF 
IN THIS WAY SHE MANAGES TO KEEP HER BODY CLOSE TO TWENTY NINE DEGREES C. 
PERFECT FOR THE BABIES DEVELOPING WITHIN HER 
BUT SHE WON'T GIVE BIRTH HERE AND NOW 
THERE ARE CAIMAN AROUND 
AT LAST SHE FINDS THE QUIET POOL THAT SHE NEEDS 
AND HER CONTRACTIONS START 
THE FIRST OF HER BABIES HAS ARRIVED 
UP IT GOES TO THE SURFACE TO TAKE ITS FIRST BREATH OF AIR 
BUT THERE ARE MORE BABIES TO COME 
EVENTUALLY SHE PRODUCES FIFTEEN 
IN FACT THAT'S QUITE MODEST FOR AN ANACONDA 
THEY CAN PRODUCE UP TO FORTY 
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THEIR LIVES THEY'RE TOTALLY INDEPENDENT 
AND GET NO CARE OR PROTECTION FROM THEIR MOTHER 
THE ANACONDA SPENDS SO MUCH OF ITS TIME IN WATER AND IS SUCH 
A POWERFUL SWIMMER THAT IT CAN BE PROPERLY CONSIDERED AQUATIC 
SNAKES HAVE BECOME ADAPTED TO ALMOST EVERY ENVIRONMENT 
INCLUDING EVEN THE SEA AS THIS ONE HAS 
IT DOESN'T OFTEN BITE BUT IT DOES HAVE AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL VENOM 
SO I'M NOT GOING TO HANDLE IT 
BUT I WILL HELP IT A LITTLE WITH THIS STICK 
AS YOU CAN SEE IT HAS A VERY FLATTENED 
PADDLE AT THE END OF ITS TAIL 
BUT ON LAND IT'S PRETTY HELPLESS 
HOWEVER IF I ASSIST IT 
IN GETTING INTO THE SEA 
AND NOW IT'S IN ITS ELEMENT 
SEAS SNAKES HAVE HAD TO MODIFY MANY OF THE FEATURES 
THAT ENABLED THEIR FAR DISTANT ANCESTORS TO COLONISE THE LAND 
THEY STILL HAVE A LUNG WITH WHICH TO BREATHE AIR LIKE OTHER SNAKES 
BUT THEY CAN ALSO ABSORB OXYGEN FROM SEA WATER THROUGH THEIR SKIN 
SALT INEVITABLY GETS INTO A SEA SNAKE'S BODY BUT THE SNAKE MANAGES 
TO GET RID OF THAT BY EXCRETING IT FROM A GLAND UNDER ITS TONGUE 
IT ALSO NEEDS TO DRINK FRESH WATER SO IN CALM SEAS 
IT WAITS AT THE SURFACE FOR RAIN 
SEA SNAKES REALLY ARE TRULY MARINE CREATURES 
THEY CAN LIVE OUT HERE IN THE OPEN OCEAN 
AND THE ONLY CLUE YOU HAVE TO THEIR LINK WITH THE LAND IS THAT 
THEY HAVE TO COME UP EVERY QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR SO FOR A GULP OF AIR 
MOST SEA SNAKES LIKE THIS BAR BELLIED SPECIES HUNT FISH 
THEY HAVE ONE OF THE MOST LETHAL VENOMS KNOWN 
WHICH KILLS ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY 
AND THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUALITY 
IF YOU HUNT FAST SWIMMING OCEAN GOING PREY 
BUT PARADOXICALLY THE MOST HIGHLY SPECIALISED SEA SNAKE OF ALL 
HAS ABANDONED VENOM ALTOGETHER 
IT HAS A BEAK LIKE A TURTLE AND A WHOLLY DIFFERENT WAY OF FEEDING 
REEF FISH DON'T LIKE TO HAVE IT AROUND 
THEY MOB IT 
IT DOESN'T EVEN RETALIATE 
IT'S NOT INTERESTED IN THEM 
IT'S AFTER THEIR EGGS 
THESE THE FISH HAVE STUCK TO THE STONY BRANCHES OF THE CORAL 
THE SNAKE'S HARDENED TURTLE LIKE TOP LIP ENABLES IT TO SCRAPE THEM OFF 
IT'S SUCH A SLOW MOVING BROWSER 
THAT ALGAE AND OTHER SMALL ORGANISMS GROW ON ITS SKIN 
AS THEY DO ON THE BOTTOM OF A BOAT 
THE LOSS OF LIMBS COULD SEEM TO BE A HANDICAP 
AND CERTAINLY MAKES A SNAKE SEEM ALIEN CREATURES TO US 
BUT IT IS THAT VERY LOSS 
THAT HAS ENABLED THE SNAKES TO COLONISE EVERY ENVIRONMENT 
FROM BELOW TO THE GROUND TO ABOVE THE GROUND 
FROM BUSHES TO TREES TO THE AIR AND EVEN TO THE SEA 
AND IT IS THAT ABSENCE OF LIMBS TOO 
WHICH HAS ENABLED THEM TO DO IT WITH SUCH ELEGANCE AND GRACE 
FILMING VENOMOUS SNAKES 
PRESENTED A LOT OF SPECIAL PROBLEMS TO THE LIFE IN COLD BLOOD TEAM 
BUT THE TOUGHEST WAS TRYING TO FILM THE RATTLESNAKE HUNTING IN THE WILD 
A RATTLESNAKE MAKING A KILL HAS RARELY EVEN BEEN SEEN 
AND NEVER BEFORE FILMED AND FOR SEVERAL REASONS 
FOR ONE THING RATTLESNAKES ARE SO WELL CAMOUFLAGED 
THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND 
WE ENLISTED THE HELP OF SNAKE EXPERT HARRY GREENE AND HIS TEAM 
THEY'VE BEEN STUDYING A GROUP OF TIMBER RATTLESNAKES 
USING RADIO TELEMETRY WHICH ENABLES THEM TO FIND THEIR RATTLESNAKES 
AT ANY TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT 
MOST OF US WOULD NEVER FIND THEM AND THEY'RE SUPERBLY CAMOUFLAGED 
EXACTLY 
BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT RADIO TELEMETRY 
WE CAN HAVE AN ANIMAL THAT WE CAN DIAL UP 
TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF SUCCESS 
THE CREW HAD TO BE ABLE TO FIND THE RATTLESNAKES ON THEIR OWN 
SO PRODUCER JAMES BRICKELL HAD TO TAKE A COURSE 
IN TELEMETRY TECHNIQUES HIMSELF 
POINT IT A LITTLE BIT MORE OVER THIS WAY 
EACH SNAKE HAS BEEN IMPLANTED WITH A TINY TRANSMITTER 
IF YOU DIAL ITS FREQUENCY YOU CAN PICK UP A BEEPING SOUND 
AND THAT GETS LOUDER THE NEARER YOU GET TO THE SNAKE 
IT'S JUST LIKE TRYING TO FIND YOUR FAVOURITE ROCK 'N ROLL STATION 
BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUR FAVOURITE RATTLESNAKE 
SO YOU JUST PUNCH IN ITS NUMBER AND IT'S ON THE AIR 
IT SOUNDS SIMPLE IN THEORY BUT THERE'S A SNAG 
IT'S HERE SOMEWHERE 
JUST BE REALLY CAREFUL GUYS 
IN A FOREST THE SIGNAL CAN BOUNCE OFF TREES 
AND GIVE YOU A FALSE READING 
SO THAT IT CAN SEEM THAT THE SNAKE IS EVERYWHERE 
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO THINK A READING IS FALSE 
AND THEN TREAD ON YOUR SNAKE BY MISTAKE 
AND YOU'LL FIND HE'S UP THERE SOMEWHERE 
LET'S FIND HIM 
JAMES IT'S STARTING TO GET DARK 
HE'S IN THERE I RECKON HE'S HUNTING 
JAMES BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU'RE GOING 
AND IT ISN'T JUST THE ONE SNAKE YOU'RE TRACKING 
THERE ARE DOZENS OF OTHERS IN THE AREA THAT AREN'T TAGGED 
FOLLOW MY HAND THERE HE IS 
ABOUT TWENTY FEET 
SIX METRES 
AND SO AT LAST THE CREW MEET A VERY SPECIAL SNAKE CALLED HANK 
HANK IS IN A PERFECT POSITION FOR HIS AMBUSH 
TO FILM THE ACTION WITHOUT DISTURBING HIM OR HIS PREY 
CAMERAMAN MARK MACEWEN HAS FITTED HIS CAMERA WITH MOTION DETECTORS 
FROM A BURGLAR ALARM 
THEY WILL TURN ON THE CAMERA WITHOUT ANYONE HAVING TO BE THERE 
SO FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY SET UP THEIR GEAR IN FRONT OF A LIVE SNAKE 
THEY CAN NOW LEAVE HANK AND TRACK ANOTHER OF HARRY'S SNAKES 
SO THAT MEANS YOU KNOW INDIVIDUAL SNAKES OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME 
DO THEY DIFFER VERY MUCH 
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY 
NOW THERE ARE SPECIES DIFFERENCES 
SO CERTAIN RATTLESNAKES SPECIES ARE MORE NASTY TEMPERED THAN OTHERS 
THAT JUST NEVER GETS RILED UP 
AND ONE YOU KNOW YOU JUST CAN'T GET TOO CLOSE TO 
WITHOUT IT GETTING UPSET 
WITH ONE CAMERA SET UP ON HANK JAMES DECIDES TO TRACK ANOTHER SNAKE 
AND TO DO SO IN THE DARK WHICH IS WHEN MOST RATTLESNAKES HUNT 
BUT IN THE PITCH BLACKNESS THERE WAS A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY THAT 
JAMES WOULD ACCIDENTALLY GET SO CLOSE TO THE SNAKE HE WAS LOOKING FOR 
HE WOULD STEP WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE 
QUITE UNNERVING IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT BEFORE 
IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY DANGEROUS 
WALKING AROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 
TRYING TO FIND A RATTLESNAKE IN THESE CONDITIONS 
IT'S REALLY CLOSE IT'S STRONGER HERE OVER NEAR THESE LOGS 
I THINK THE SNAKE'S ABOUT PROBABLY FIVE TEN METRES AWAY 
IT WOULD BE EASIER TO FIND A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK 
THAN TO FIND A REPTILE THAT LOOKS 
LIKE A LOAD OF DEAD LEAVES IN A HUGE PILE OF DEAD LEAVES 
HAVE YOU FOUND HIM FELLAS 
NEGATIVE MARK WE'VE GOT TO A HUGE PILE OF LOGS AND WOOD 
THE TEAM DECIDE TO ABANDON TRACKING THE SECOND SNAKE 
AND INSTEAD CHECK ON THE CAMERA THEY'D LEFT ON HANK IN THE AFTERNOON 
I THINK IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO GO POKING AROUND IN THERE 
AND YOU WOULDN'T GET THE LIGHTS AND THE CAMERA IN 
SO WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK 
WE'VE SEEN THINGS ON YOUR VIDEOS WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE 
WHICH IS KIND OF SURPRISING 
I MEAN WE'VE WATCHED SNAKES A LOT ALL THE RATTLESNAKE BIOLOGISTS 
AND WE'VE SEEN THINGS ON YOUR VIDEOS WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE 
SO ITS ACTUALLY KIND OF EXCITING TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS KIND OF 
COLLABORATION MIGHT REALLY BE A FEEDBACK 
BETWEEN THE MEDIA AND THE PUBLIC AND SCIENCE AND SO FORTH 
AND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING HAD HAPPENED 
AT OUR VERY FIRST ATTEMPT AND IN BROAD DAYLIGHT 
A CHIPMUNK HAD TRIPPED THE MOTION DETECTORS AND HANK MAKES A KILL 
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS 
WE'VE GOT A STRIKE ALREADY WE'VE GOT IT 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE WINDING ME UP I SAID JAMES SOMETHING'S HAPPENED 
I THOUGHT THAT'S A CLASSIC WIND UP FIRST NIGHT TO GET THAT 
WE HADN'T GOT THE EATING SHOT BUT IT'S A START 
AND THEN THE CAMERA IS SET OFF AGAIN 
BY A SECOND CHIPMUNK BEHAVING VERY STRANGELY 
WE SHOWED THE RECORDING TO HARRY AND HE WAS FASCINATED 
NOW WHAT WAS THAT CHIPMUNK DOING 
WAS IT PERCEIVING SOMETHING THAT THE OTHER CHIPMUNK LEFT 
AS SOME KIND OF ALARM ODOUR OR SOMETHING 
WAS IT PERCEIVING THE ODOUR OF THE RATTLESNAKE 
OR WAS IT SOMETHING I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE YET 
BUT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON THERE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW TO EXPECT ANYWAY 
AND IT'S IN YOUR FILM 
HANK COULD CLEARLY BE THE STAR OF THE SHOW 
SO THE CREW DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ALL THEIR EFFORTS ON HIM 
AND TO TRACK HIM FOR TWO WEEKS AROUND THE CLOCK 
THEY QUICKLY LEARN THAT 
DESPITE HIS ABILITY TO HURT ONE OF THEM VERY SERIOUSLY 
HE SEEMS PRETTY UNCONCERNED 
IN FACT HE NEVER EVEN RATTLES A WARNING AT THEM 
THE MORE THEY GET TO KNOW HIM 
THE MORE THEY THINK THEY'VE GOT A GOOD CHANCE OF FILMING ANOTHER HUNT 
BUT THEN THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM 
IT'S JUST BEEN RAINING HERE NON STOP FOR THE PAST THREE DAYS 
AND THEY SAY THAT TUESDAY AFTERNOON'S HARD RAIN STORM WAS 
JUST AS THINGS ARE LOOKING SO PROMISING NEW YORK STATE HAS ITS 
WORST FLOODS FOR A DECADE AND ALL FILMING COMES TO A STANDSTILL 
AS YOU CAN SEE THE WEATHER'S AWFUL 
WON'T AFFECT THE RATTLESNAKE AT ALL HE'S PERFECTLY HAPPY 
HE'LL BE SAT DOWN IN HERE JUST WAITING 
BUT IT DOES AFFECT THE MAMMALS 
THE CHIPMUNKS AND THE MICE THEY'LL JUST BE HUNKERED DOWN SOMEWHERE 
NOT DOING ANYTHING VERY MUCH AND IT AFFECTS US BUT HE'LL BE FINE 
WE CAN'T FILM ANYTHING SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WAITING NOW 
AFTER TRACKING HIM IN THE RAIN FOR TEN DAYS 
THERE'S A BREAK IN THE WEATHER AND HANK STARTS HUNTING AGAIN 
HE CHOOSES A POSITION FOR AN AMBUSH IN A VERY ACCESSIBLE SPOT 
THE TEAM HAS ANOTHER CHANCE TO USE THEIR REMOTE CAMERAS 
THIS TIME OPERATING IN NIGHT VISION 
JAMES JUST BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU COME IN DON'T GO THAT WAY 
I THINK THAT'S THE DIRECTION HE'S HEADED IN 
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING HAVE YOU 
MATE WE'VE GOT HIM HITTING A MOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF FRAME 
AND SWALLOWING IT 
THIS TIME THEY GET MORE THAN THE STRIKE 
THIS TIME HANK DECIDES TO EAT HIS DINNER VERY OBLIGINGLY 
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA 
MATE THAT IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE PIECE OF BEHAVIOUR 
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN 
SO AFTER TWO WEEKS AND A LOT OF EFFORT THEY SUCCEED IN CAPTURING 
A CRUCIAL AND INTIMATE MOMENT IN THE LIFE OF THIS VERY SPECIAL SNAKE 
PEOPLE DON'T AUTOMATICALLY LOVE SNAKES MOST OF THEM DON'T 
AND YET IF YOU CAN SHOW THEM THINGS ABOUT THE LIVES OF THESE ANIMALS 
THAT IMPRESS THEM WITH THE FACT THESE ARE ANIMALS 
WITH COMPLEX DAILY ACTIVITIES 
THESE AREN'T WAITING AROUND FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO KILL PEOPLE 
WHEN YOU TELL PEOPLE THINGS LIKE THAT THEY GET DRAWN IN 
AND HOPEFULLY WHEN WE SHOW THEM YOUR FILMS THEY'LL BE DRAWN IN 
WELL YOU'VE DRAWN ME IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASURE 
AND WHEN I GET TO SEE THE FOOTAGE IT'S FAIR TO SAY 
THAT I'M JUST AS KNOCKED SIDEWAYS AS THE CREW HAD BEEN 
THERE'S THE MOUSE 
OH MY GOODNESS 
YES 
THAT'S A DEAD MOUSE ALL RIGHT 
FOR A FREE WALL POSTER FEATURING BRITISH REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS 
AND TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT OPEN UNIVERSITY PROGRAMMES 
NEXT WEEK JOIN ME FOR THE STORY OF THE ARMOURED GIANTS 
THE TORTOISES TURTLES AND CROCODILES 
THERE ARE THINGS 
WAITING IN THE DARKNESS 
CREATURES OF METAL AND FIRE AND BLOOD 
BUT HE'S OUT THERE BURNING THROUGH TIME 
FACING A THOUSAND DANGERS ACROSS THE STARS AND NEVER GIVING UP 
HE LOOKS LIKE A MAN BUT HE'S A LEGEND AND HIS NAME 
IS THE DOCTOR 
HE'LL COME BACK TO SAVE US 
AND THIS TIME I'M GONNA BE READY 
THEN JUST LIKE THAT 
WE'LL BE GONE
