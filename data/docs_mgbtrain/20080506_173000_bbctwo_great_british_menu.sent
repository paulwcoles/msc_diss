THE FIGHT GOES ON ON GREAT BRITISH MENU 
OUR TALENTED CHEFS ARE BATTLING FOR THE CHANCE TO PROVE 
THAT MODERN BRITISH FOOD IS UP THERE WITH THE BEST IN THE WORLD 
THE WINNERS WILL PREPARE A FABULOUS FOUR COURSE MEAN AT THE TOP OF THE ICONIC GHERKIN IN CENTRAL LONDON 
HOSTING THE BANQUET WILL BE THE CULINARY TRAILBLAZER HESTON BLUMENTHAL 
AND HIS GUESTS WILL INCLUDE OUTSTANDING CHEFS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE 
SO THE CHALLENGE FOR OUR CHEFS IS IMMENSE 
TOUGHING IT OUT IN THIS WEEK'S HEAT TO REPRESENT THE SOUTH WEST 
IN OUR FINALS ARE ELISHA CARTER AND CHRIS HORRIDGE 
AND NEITHER OF THEM IS GOING TO GIVE AN INCH 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ON TOP FORM OR YOU'LL FALL BY THE WAYSIDE 
ALL I CAN SAY IS I KNOW FULL WELL THAT MY COURSE WILL BE A COURSE THAT PEOPLE REMEMBER 
ELISHA CARTER AND CHRIS HORRIDGE ARE TWO HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CHEFS 
WHO DESPITE THEIR VERY DIFFERENT STYLES 
BOTH RECKON THAT THEY REPRESENT THE BEST OF MODERN BRITISH COOKING IN THE SOUTH WEST 
TO SHOWCASE THEIR TALENT EACH CHEF HAS DESIGNED AN ORIGINAL FOUR COURSE MEAL 
EVERY DAY THIS WEEK THEY'LL COOK A DIFFERENT COURSE 
BEFORE PRESENTING THEIR COMPLETE MENU TO THE JUDGES ON FRIDAY 
THEY AND THEY ALONE WILL DECIDE WHETHER IT'S ELISHA OR CHRIS 
WHO GOES ON TO REPRESENT THE SOUTH WEST IN THE FINAL 
ONLY ONE CHEF CAN WIN THIS WEEK AND BOTH ARE DETERMINED TO COOK AT THE GHERKIN 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TODAY I'M READY TO COOK AND JUST SHOW OFF 
I'LL COOK TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY 
I WANT TO GO THROUGH I BELIEVE MY FOOD IS THE FUTURE OF FOOD IN THE U. K. 
OF COURSE I WANT TO GO THROUGH 
YESTERDAY THE TWO CHEFS BEGAN BY COOKING THEIR STARTER COURSE 
CHRIS RECKONS YOUR FATE'S ON THE PLATE 
AND IS DETERMINED TO FEED EVERYONE WITH EXTREMELY HEALTHY 
AS WELL AS TASTY FOOD 
SO HE PREPARED WILD PIGEON CURED IN BIRCH SAP WINE 
SWEETENED WITH THE SUGAR ALTERNATIVE XYLITOL 
HE SERVED IT WITH ROAST BEETROOT OMEGA RICH SEEDS BROCCOLI SPROUTS 
AND VITAMIN C. PACKED APRICOT PUREE 
ELISHA'S A MORE CLASSICAL CHEF AND IS ONLY REALLY INTERESTED 
IN SERVING UP THE TASTIEST FOOD 
REGARDLESS OF THE BELT BUSTING CONSEQUENCES 
SO HE KICKED OFF HIS MENU WITH SLICES OF RAW BEEF FILLET 
AND A VERY POSH OXTAIL AND QUAIL SCOTCH EGG 
HE DRESSED THE PLATE WITH WHITE WINE JELLY 
MUSHROOM MOUSSE AND SALAD LEAVES 
SO THIS WEEK IT'S HEALTH VERSES HEDONISM IN A HEAD ON CLASH 
MORNING MORNING MORNING 
ANOTHER DAY HOW'S THINGS REALLY GOOD ACTUALLY 
DID YOU SLEEP WELL I CERTAINLY DID 
THEY BOTH SEEM FULL OF THE JOYS OF SPRING 
LET'S SEE WHAT THEY'VE GOT IN MIND FOR THE FISH COURSE 
THAT'S AN UNUSUAL TRANSPORT FOR TURBOT 
LOOK AT THIS HUMDINGER OF A FISH 
THAT IS MY TURBOT FOR TODAY 
I'M GOING TO DO TURBOT 
WITH 
SOME VENISON HAM 
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO WRAP THE TURBOT IN THE VENISON HAM 
AND GET THE FLAVOUR OF THE SALT INTO THE TURBOT 
AND GENTLY STEAM THAT FANTASTIC 
ELISHA'S OBVIOUSLY EXCITED 
ABOUT THIS TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TAKE ON SURF AND TURF 
HE'S SERVING TURBOT TOPPED WITH LOCALLY CURED VENISON HAM 
ALONGSIDE FRIED SHRIMP AND LANGOUSTINE DUMPLINGS 
WITH BOTH FENNEL CONFIT AND PUREE 
NOW TO YOU WHAT HAVE YOU GOT 
HERE I'VE GOT LING 
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO BE SLOW POACHING IT IN A WATER BATH HERE 
I'M GOING TO BE DOING SOME BROAD BEANS NICE 
AND I'M USING A WHITE WINE LOCAL TO THE SOUTH WEST IT'S MADE JUST OUTSIDE BATH 
I'M USING SOME FENNEL ON THE DISH O. K. 
I'M THEN GOING TO BE THE SORT OF KEY ELEMENT IS THIS HERE WHICH IS SOMETHING I MANUFACTURE MYSELF 
THIS IS WHAT I'M CALLING A CREAM SUBSTITUTE 
IT'S COMPLETELY PLANT BASED 
AND YET IT'S VERY VERY SIMILAR TO CREAM 
SO THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE 
BUT IT'S A SECRET RECIPE SO I WON'T BE DIVULGING HOW I DO THAT 
OH CHRIS DON'T BE LIKE THAT 
SO CHRIS IS POACHING LING WHICH IS A MILD TASTING WHITE FISH 
HE'S SERVING IT WITH FENNEL AND BROAD BEANS 
MIXED WITH HIS OWN SECRET CREAM SUBSTITUTE 
FINALLY HE'S DRESSING THE PLATE WITH FLOWERS AND WILD HERBS 
AND SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FROM YOUR AUNTIE 
AMINO GINSENG BUBBLES 
GINSENG AND LIQUID AMINO LIQUID AMINO 
THIS IS BASED ON A PLANT SOURCE GETTING THE AMINO ACIDS 
THAT YOU FIND IN AN ANIMAL A MEAT PROTEIN 
O. K. SO IT'S HIGH IN GLUTAMATE WHICH MEANS YOU WANT TO EAT MORE OF IT 
I'LL PUT IT WITH THIS BECAUSE IT'S A HEALTHY DISH 
THIS MAKES YOU WANT TO EAT MORE EVERYBODY GETS HEALTHIER 
HE'S CLEARLY A SCIENTIST AT HEART 
I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELISHA MAKES OF IT THOUGH 
ELISHA CARTER IS LONDON BORN AND BRED 
BUT WHEN HE WAS OFFERED THE POSITION OF HEAD CHEF AT A PRESTIGIOUS COUNTRY RESTAURANT 
HE HAPPILY UPPED STICKS AND MOVED DOWN TO SHEPTON MALLET IN SOMERSET 
HE'S A SUCCESSFUL AND WELL ESTABLISHED HEAD CHEF NOW 
BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS OBVIOUS THAT HE'D BE TURNING OUT GOURMET MEALS 
AT ONE POINT IT SEEMED MORE LIKELY THAT HE'D BE CRAWLING ABOUT FIXING THE WIRING 
I DID GO TO THE ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING COLLEGE 
AND I STAYED THERE PROBABLY FOUR HOURS 
AND I JUST THOUGHT IT WASN'T FOR ME 
I JUST WANTED SOMETHING REALLY I COULD GET MY HANDS INTO 
FORTUNATELY HE CHOSE COOKING AND HE HASN'T LOOKED BACK SINCE 
HIS LUCKY BREAK CAME WHEN HE WAS OFFERED A DAY'S WORK EXPERIENCE 
IN A TOP PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN 
THERE WAS NO GUARANTEE IT WOULD LEAD ANYWHERE 
BUT THEN AGAIN IT WAS AT THE RITZ 
I GOT THERE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND I WORKED RIGHT THROUGH TILL ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK THAT EVENING 
AT NINE O'CLOCK I SAID 
CHEF DO YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT I'VE GOT THE JOB 
AND HE SAID HE SMILED AT ME AND SAID WE'VE GOT A JOB FOR YOU 
SO FROM THE MOMENT I GOT THERE FOR THE DAY'S TRIAL 
I KNEW IT WAS THE PLACE FOR ME AND IT'S WHAT I WANTED 
SO I JUST PUT EVERYTHING I COULD INTO IT 
HIS COMMITMENT PAID OFF AND AFTER TWO YEARS OF HARD CLASSICAL TRAINING AT THE RITZ 
ELISHA MOVED ON TO DEVELOP HIS SKILLS AT TOP RESTAURANTS AROUND THE COUNTRY 
INCLUDING LE MANOIR AUX QUAT SAISONS 
BUT THEN HE BEGAN WORKING WITH ONE OF GREAT BRITISH MENU'S FAVOURITES 
RICHARD CORRIGAN 
AND LEARNT A MUCH SIMPLER BUT JUST AS TASTY STYLE OF COOKING 
I'VE CONCENTRATED ON THE FOIE GRAS THE DOVER SOLES 
I HAVE CONCENTRATED ON THE LOBSTERS AND ALL THAT 
AND HE WAS THE ONE HE SAID LOOK WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO BASICS 
YOU WOULDN'T SAY IT'S AN IRISH WAY OF COOKING 
BUT IT'S LIKE A PEASANT WAY BUT DONE VERY WELL 
THAT'S WHAT RICHARD TAUGHT ME ABOUT 
IT'S A WAY OF EXTENDING THINGS DIFFERENT TEXTURES DIFFERENT FLAVOURS 
ALL COMING TOGETHER AS ONE 
WITH MENTORS OF THAT CALIBRE BEHIND HIM 
ELISHA WAS SOON OFFERED THE TOP JOB AT CHARLTON HOUSE 
AND DESPITE PLENTY OF OTHER FINE RESTAURANTS IN THE REGION 
HIS FOOD QUICKLY BEGAN TO WIN AWARDS 
THE PEOPLE DOWN HERE HAVE DONE HIM PROUD 
AND HE'S GLAD TO DO BATTLE FOR THE SOUTH WEST ON GREAT BRITISH MENU 
EVEN THOUGH NOBODY KNEW ME THEY VOTED ME BEST CHEF IN SOMERSET 
WHICH WAS GREAT AND FOR ANYONE TO SAY 
I WANT YOU TO BE PART OF THE SOUTH WEST IS A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN 
ELISHA'S PREPARING HIS FENNEL FOR BOTH THE PUREE AND CONFIT 
ACROSS THE COUNTER TOP CHRIS IS ALSO MAKING A PUREE 
BUT THIS TIME WITH WILD HERBS 
CHRIS HOW DID YOU GET INTO THIS NUTRITIONAL 
I BASICALLY STARTED ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO TEN TO TWELVE YEARS AGO 
I HAD AN OPERATION AND I WANTED TO GET BACK TO WORK QUICKLY 
I MADE A DIET WITH THE RECOMMENDED DAILY AMOUNT OF VITAMINS AND MINERALS 
AND IT WORKED I WENT BACK TO SEE A DOCTOR AND HE SAID YOU HEALED UP MORE THAN WE EXPECTED 
I TOLD HIM ABOUT MY DIET AND HE WENT MAYBE THAT WAS IT SO I GOT INTERESTED IN NUTRITION 
TO THE STAGE WHERE I'VE NOW FORMED A GROUP WITH SCIENTISTS AND CHEMISTS 
AND WE'RE ABOUT PUT RESEARCH GRANTS IN TO HOPEFULLY PROVE THAT GOOD FOOD 
CAN DECREASE PATIENT RECOVERY TIMES IN HOSPITAL 
SO CHRIS IS A MAN WITH A MISSION 
AND THIS COMPETITION IS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO PREACH TO A WIDER AUDIENCE 
CHRIS HORRIDGE HAS WON NUMEROUS AWARDS INCLUDING A MICHELIN STAR 
FOR THE HEALTHY MODERN CUISINE 
WHICH HE SERVES AT THE PRIORY HOTEL IN BATH 
GOT ONE TUNA TWO SALMON ONE VENISON 
ALTHOUGH HE SPENT TWO YEARS AT CATERING COLLEGE 
CHRIS DECIDED TO JOIN THE R. A. F. 
BEFORE HAVING ONE OF THOSE CAREER CHANGING MOMENTS 
AS A RESULT OF DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW WATCHING T. V. 
LENNY HENRY IS THE REASON WHY I'M SAT HERE NOW 
MIDWAY THROUGH THE NINETIES THERE WAS A PROGRAMME CALLED CHEF 
I ENJOYED THE HUMOUR BUT I COULD SEE WHAT HE WAS GETTING AT 
AND I THOUGHT I LOVE THE IDEA THAT HE'S COMPLETELY MAD ABOUT FOOD REALLY 
BUT I COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS DOING IT AND SO 
I SET MYSELF A TEN YEAR PLAN 
I THOUGHT HOW CAN I ACHIEVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO CHRIS QUIT THE R. A. F. 
AND FOUND HIMSELF AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF A NEW CAREER LADDER 
TRAINING AT ONE OF THE SAME PLACES AS ELISHA 
RAYMOND BLANC'S LE MANOIR AUX QUAT SAISONS 
THERE'S A COUPLE OF KEY INFLUENCES IN MY LIFE RAYMOND BLANC IS ONE 
AND THE OTHER IS HIS HEAD CHEF GARY JONES 
I SPOTTED THE QUALITIES OF LEADERSHIP 
I COULD SEE TOTAL ORGANISATIONAL SKILLS 
AND I THINK THAT WAS A VERY GOOD CHOICE WASN'T IT 
WITHOUT A DOUBT 
THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH CRUCIAL TO WHY I'M SAT HERE 
AND INVOLVED IN WHERE I AM 
IT WAS THOSE GUYS WHO GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN A PLACE 
WHERE EVERY DAY WAS A CHALLENGE 
BUT THE REWARD IS THERE IF YOU PUT THE HARD WORK IN 
SO I STARTED AT THE BOTTOM AND I ROSE TO THE TOP 
NO NO NO I WAS JUNIOR SOUS LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED 
HE OBVIOUSLY ENJOYED HIS TRAINING 
BUT HE'D SET OUT HIS TEN YEAR GAME PLAN AND VERY NEARLY STUCK TO IT 
I WAS TWENTY FIVE WHEN I MADE THAT DECISION 
I TOOK THE HEAD CHEF'S JOB OVER HERE IN THE BATH PRIORY FOUR DAYS AFTER MY THIRTY FIFTH BIRTHDAY 
I'D MISSED IT BY FOUR DAYS BUT THAT'S NOT BAD ON TEN YEARS 
WITH CONTROL OVER HIS OWN KITCHEN HE COULD NOW CONCENTRATE 
ON DEVELOPING HIS THREE DIMENSIONAL CUISINE 
FOOD THAT LOOKS AND TASTES GOOD AS WELL AS IMPROVING YOUR HEALTH 
HE THINKS IT'S IDEAL FOR THIS COMPETITION 
MODERN BRITISH FOOD IS CUTTING EDGE PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES TAKING THINGS FORWARD 
IT'S THREE DIMENSIONAL CUISINE IT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO 
PRESENTATION FLAVOUR NUTRITION 
BACK IN OUR KITCHEN ELISHA IS MAKING A START ON HIS DUMPLINGS 
A RICH BLEND OF BROWN SHRIMPS POACHED LANGOUSTINE AND SALMON MOUSSE 
CHRIS IS BUSY PREPPING HIS BABY FENNEL 
BUT NOT TOO BUSY TO CHALLENGE ELISHA'S DISH 
SO HOW DOES REWORKING MORE SORT OF TRADITIONAL STYLE DISHES 
CONSTITUTE BEING THE FUTURE OF FOOD IN THE U. K. ELISHA 
YOU CAN NEVER REINVENT STUFF BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS ENHANCE 
YOUR SPIN ON FOOD OF THE FUTURE THEN IS DOING WHAT WE'VE DONE BEFORE 
BUT MAYBE PRESENTING IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY YES 
SO YOUR IDEA OF THE FUTURE OF FOOD IS A BEAUTIFUL LANGOUSTINE PUREED UP AND THEN DEEP FRIED 
NOT PUREED GET IT RIGHT IT'S CHOPPED UP YEAH 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH CHOPPING YOU PUT CHOPPED LANGOUSTINES INTO RAVIOLIS 
SO THEORETICALLY IT'S LIKE A RAVIOLI BUT WITH BREAD CRUMBS 
O. K. EXACTLY I REST MY CASE CHRIS 
I CAN'T SEE CHRIS PERSUADING ELISHA TO HIS WAY OF THINKING IN A THOUSAND YEARS 
BUT HE'S SO DRIVEN THAT HE CAN'T HELP TRYING EVERY NOW AND AGAIN 
RIGHT NOW THOUGH HE HAS TO CONCENTRATE ON HIS UNUSUAL CHOICE OF FISH 
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE LING 
I CHOSE LING JUST BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE KNOWN BRITISH FISH 
IT'S A GREAT REPLACEMENT FOR COD IT'S AN UNUSUAL FISH 
IT REMINDS ME OF HAKE M. M. M. 
IT DOESN'T MUCH LOOK LIKE BEEF 
CONSIDERING IT WAS CALLED BEEF OF THE SEA AT ONE TIME 
BEEF OF THE SEA THAT'S A NEW ONE 
BUT HAVING DECIDED TO COOK THIS MORE SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE TO COD 
AND WANTING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT 
CHRIS HAD TO SET OFF FOR THE COAST VERY EARLY INDEED 
IT'S FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE MORNING THE FISHING BOATS HAVE SAFELY MOORED UP 
AND ARE LANDING THEIR CATCHES ON TO THE DOCK AT PLYMOUTH HARBOUR 
AS SOON AS THE BOATS HAVE UNLOADED 
THE FISH MARKET OPENS AND THE AUCTION BEGINS 
AT PLYMOUTH BIDDING IS ELECTRONIC 
IT CAN EITHER BE DONE IN THE MARKET ITSELF OR ONLINE FROM ANYWHERE 
CHRIS CAME HERE TO MEET UP WITH HIS SUPPLIER JOHNNY GODDON 
WHO HE HOPED HAD MANAGED TO BUY HIM SOME GOOD QUALITY LING 
HERE IT IS 
IT'S QUITE LARGE IN HERE 
IT'S BIG ISN'T IT 
HERE WE ARE THIS IS THE LING CHRIS THAT'S A BEAUTY 
IT'S A FANTASTIC LOOKING FISH 
LING LIVE MAINLY IN VERY DEEP WATER UP TO FOUR HUNDRED METRES 
AND DINE ON FLAT FISH OCTOPUS AND THEIR OWN RELATIVES 
POLLOCK AND LING ARE ACTUALLY IN THE SAME FAMILY 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TAILS THAT'S SORT OF COD LIKE 
AND THIS IS EEL LIKE THIS IS MORE LIKE A CONGER EEL THAN A COD 
DO YOU SEE IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY CRACKING FISH 
YOU CAN SEE BY JUST THE SLIME THE FRESHNESS OF IT 
WHEN YOU SEE A FISH THAT'S A COUPLE OF DAYS OLD 
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT LOVELY TRANSLUCENT COLOUR YEAH 
THE SMELL OF IT THERE'S NO SMELL THAT SHOWS HOW FRESH IT IS 
CHRIS DIDN'T THINK THERE'D BE MUCH OF A MARKET FOR LING 
BUT HE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE INTERESTED IN IT 
I'VE SEEN LOTS OF IT HERE SO HOW COME I DON'T SEE 
MORE OF IT BEING USED IN RESTAURANTS 
IT'S A VERY UNPOPULAR FISH TO BE HONEST 
IT'S NOT UP WITH THE PRIME FISH BASS TURBOT BRILL YOU KNOW 
THIS IS THE LOWER STANDARD 
IF WE DON'T USE IN RESTAURANTS WHAT ARE WE USING IT FOR 
BECAUSE IT IS A RELATIVELY CHEAP FISH A LOT OF IT GETS FILLETED AND SKINNED 
DICED UP PUT INTO FISH PIES FISH CAKES 
YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT THEY BULK OUT WITH A NICE WHITE FISH RIGHT 
SO IF LING'S MAINLY USED TO BULK OUT FISH PIES 
DOES IT ACTUALLY TASTE ANY GOOD ON ITS OWN 
CHRIS AND JOHNNY SAMPLED IT 
THAT'S SO FRESH YOU CAN ACTUALLY EAT THAT LIKE THAT 
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
IT'S LIKE SUSHI ACTUALLY ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL 
WELL HE'S HAPPY WITH HIS CHOICE 
GOOD DAY THEN CHRIS IT'S BEEN GREAT REALLY ENJOYED IT 
THE SUN'S ONLY JUST RISING AND WE'VE FINISHED THE DAY'S WORK 
ARE YOUR DAYS LIKE THIS EVERY DAY EVERY DAY 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN 
CHRIS GETS ON WITH FILLETING THE LING HE'S HAD FRESHLY DELIVERED FROM BILLINGSGATE 
WHILE ELISHA PREPS THE SAUCE FOR HIS TURBOT 
AND THOUGH BOTH CHEFS TRAINED UNDER RAYMOND BLANC 
OR R. B. AS HIS STAFF CALL HIM THEIR PATHS NEVER CROSSED UNTIL NOW 
WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE AT MANOIR LIKE 
IT WAS TOUGH TO START WITH I'D BEEN OUT OF THE MILITARY 
ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS WHEN I STARTED AT LE MANOIR 
I GOT THE FATEFUL TELEPHONE CALL FROM R. B. 
I WAS WORKING AT HIS BRASSERIE IN PETIT BLANC 
SO I WAS LIKE I'M REALLY UP FOR THAT 
TWO OR THREE MONTHS LATER I WAS THINKING AM I READY FOR THIS 
IT WAS LIKE A MASSIVE SHOCK TO GO FROM AIR FORCE FOOD 
TO SOME OF THE FINEST FOOD IN THE U. K. IF NOT PARTS OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET USED TO IT WHAT ABOUT YOU YOU DID YOUR TIME AT LE MANOIR AS WELL 
ABSOLUTELY I DID LEARN SO MUCH FROM R. B. 
I THINK HIS TASTE BUDS ARE PHENOMENAL 
HE CAN COME UP WITH SOME EXTRAORDINARY IDEAS 
I HAVE GOT TO TO GIVE HIM CREDIT 
WELL THEY MAY HAVE HAD THE SAME GREAT TRAINING 
BUT THEIR VIEWS ON MODERN BRITISH COOKING ARE VERY DIFFERENT 
ELISHA JUST WANTS TO GIVE HIS CUSTOMERS A REAL TREAT 
WHILE CHRIS FEELS HE SHOULD MAKE THEM MORE HEALTHY AT THE SAME TIME 
IT'LL BE FASCINATING TO SEE WHAT THE JUDGES THINK 
WHEN THEY TASTE BOTH MENUS AT THE END OF THE WEEK 
DO YOU FEEL CONFIDENT YOU'LL GET THROUGH 
I'M ALWAYS CONFIDENT I'M LIKE YOU 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY LET THE BEST MAN WIN 
STILL TO COME 
TO HUNT SOME TURBOT 
AND CHRIS MAKES IT VERY CLEAR WHAT HE THINKS OF HIS COOKING 
HE'S TAKEN FANTASTIC SCOTTISH LANGOUSTINES 
AND TURNED THEM INTO THAT 
BACK IN THE KITCHEN THE TWO CHEFS ARE CREATING THEIR HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL DISHES 
CHRIS IS SERVING A DAINTY PLATE 
OF POACHED LING WITH A SCATTERING OF BROAD BEANS 
FENNEL FLOWERS HEDGE HERBS AND A SAUCE OF AMINO GINSENG BUBBLES 
EVEN MORE UNUSUAL IS THE BROAD BEANS ARE BEING SERVED 
IN A NON DAIRY VERSION OF CREAM THAT CHRIS INVENTED 
IT'S COMPLETELY PLANT BASED 
SO YOU CAN HAVE THE SAME FOOD WHETHER YOU'RE LACTOSE INTOLERANT AS THE PERSON SAT NEXT TO YOU 
WITHOUT ANY OF YOU KNOWING THERE'S NO DAIRY PRODUCTS IN THERE 
ELISHA'S GOING DOWN A DIFFERENT ROAD WITH HIS MEATY 
BUT DELICATELY FLAVOURED TURBOT TOPPED WITH CURED VENISON HAM 
HE'S SERVING IT WITH SHRIMP AND LANGOUSTINE DUMPLINGS 
AND BOTH FENNEL CONFIT AND PUREE 
HE'S GETTING USED TO CHRIS BOMBARDING HIM WITH SCIENCE 
AND HE'S NOT GOING TO LET IT DISTRACT HIM 
VERY EDUCATIONAL I'VE NEVER BEEN WITH A CHEF LIKE THAT BEFORE 
GOOD LUCK TO HIM 
BUT THE MAIN THING IS FOR ME TO CONCENTRATE ON WHAT I'M DOING 
CHRIS HAS FINISHING FILLETING HIS LING AND SEALS IT IN VACUUM BAGS 
BEFORE GENTLY POACHING IT IN WARM WATER 
TWELVE MINUTES WE'RE OFF O. K. 
ELISHA'S GOING TO STEAM HIS TURBOT 
IT'S A POPULAR FISH BOTH IN HIS RESTAURANT AND ON GREAT BRITISH MENU 
BUT HE WANTED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT IT BEFORE THE COMPETITION BEGAN 
IN SEARCH OF THE VERY BEST TURBOT 
ELISHA HEADED TO ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR FISHING PORTS IN BRITAIN 
BRIXHAM IN DEVON 
THIS PRETTY SEASIDE TOWN IS PERFECTLY SITED FOR THE EXTRAORDINARILY RICH FISHING GROUNDS 
OFF THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
MORNING NEIL GOOD MORNING ELISHA HOW ARE YOU GOOD 
HE MET UP WITH NEIL BURN TILBURY 
WHO TOOK HIM OUT TO WHERE HIS BOATS ARE FISHING TWELVE MILES OFF THE COAST 
THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT TURBOT IT'S A SUSTAINABLE SPECIES 
IT'S VERY POPULAR WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE SPECIES AS WELL 
IT CAN BE CAUGHT LOCALLY AROUND THESE SHORES 
SMALL ONES CAN BE SERVED WHOLE BUT ALSO IT'S THICK ENOUGH TO DO FILLETS AS WELL 
THERE'S MORE TO DO WITH A TURBOT THAN A POLLOCK OR A COD 
OR A LING ELISHA HOPES 
NEIL EXPLAINED THAT CATCHING FLATFISH REQUIRES SPECIALLY DESIGNED NETS AND TECHNIQUES 
WE'RE RUNNING WHAT ARE CALLED TRAMMEL NETS O. K. 
THEY'RE SPECIFIC TO FLATFISH 
YOU HAVE A NET THAT HAS THREE WALLS AND WHEN THE FISH SWIM INTO IT 
IT PUSHES AND FORMS A BAG IN BETWEEN THE THREE DIFFERENT NETS 
AND CATCHES THE FISH 
HOW MANY NETS DO YOU HAVE 
WE'D HAVE EIGHT IN ONE DAY 
WE SHOOT THEM ONE DAY AND THEN YOU'D COLLECT THEM THE FOLLOWING DAY 
THE FISH COME UP TO FEED IN THE EVENING 
THAT'S WHY YOU LEAVE THEM OVERNIGHT 
HAVING EXPERIENCED LIFE ON THE OCEAN WAVE 
ELISHA WAS HAPPY TO RETURN TO DRY LAND AND VISIT THE DAILY AUCTION 
BRIXHAM MARKET IS THE LARGEST IN THE SOUTH WEST 
FRESH FISH LANDED HERE ARE IN GREAT DEMAND ALL OVER BRITAIN AND EUROPE 
AND NIGEL WARD FROM CHANNEL FISHERIES EXPLAINED WHY 
WHAT MAKES THIS MARKET SO SPECIAL IN THE WHOLE OF THE ENGLISH FISHING AREA 
IS THAT WE HAVE QUITE SHALLOW WATERS 
WHICH GIVES US THE WIDE VARIETY WHICH ALL CHEFS WANT 
THEY WANT THE JOHN DORIES THE RED MULLETS THE SEA BASS 
THE TURBOT AND THE BRILL AND WE HAVE THE WHOLE VARIETY HERE 
ELISHA WANTED TO SEE THE SIZE OF TURBOTS IN THE MARKET 
BECAUSE IT WILL BE CRITICAL TO HIS DISH 
I KNOW ONE FISH YOU'RE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN IS THE TURBOT 
WE HAVE A GREAT ONE HERE WHICH HAS BEEN CAUGHT ON A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE DAY BOAT 
THAT'S LIKE A BEAUTIFUL SIX KILO FOURTEEN POUND FISH 
IS THIS THE KIND OF THING YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FOR THE COMPETITION 
IT'S EXACTLY BUT I WANT A SMALLER VERSION 
I DON'T WANT IT TOO MEATY 
I JUST WANT IT SO WHEN I WRAP MY VENISON HAM IN IT 
I DON'T WANT A MEATY FISH I WANT NICE DELICATE FLAVOURS 
NIGEL THIS IS THE ONE AH RIGHT THIS IS THE ONE I WANT YES 
HAVING FOUND WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR ELISHA HAD IT FILLETED 
SO HE SHOULD SHOW NIGEL WHAT HE WAS PLANNING TO DO 
WHEN I STEAM IT THE FLAVOUR COMES THROUGH NICELY THROUGH THE VENISON HAM AS WELL AS THE TURBOT 
I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR EXACTLY 
THANKS DARREN SOUND DELICIOUS 
THAT IS A WINNING DISH 
LIKE CHRIS ELISHA HAD HIS FISH DELIVERED FRESH FROM BILLINGSGATE FOR THE COMPETITION 
ALL HE HAS TO DO NOW IS SLICE HIS CURED VENISON HAM 
STRAIGHT FROM HIS RESTAURANT'S ORGANIC FARM 
ELISHA'S VENISON IS CURED FOR THREE WEEK BEFORE HANGING 
AND HE TAKES EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW IT OFF 
WE BRUSH IT OFF AND WE LEAVE IT TO HANG 
IN A SHED FOR THREE TO FOUR MONTHS 
LET'S TASTE IT 
THAT'S NICE THAT IT'S REALLY NICE 
I'M SO PROUD OF THIS 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING YOUR FISH DISH 
TO ELISHA IT'S JUST A SUPERB INGREDIENT 
BUT CHRIS SEES A DARKER SIDE TO IT 
CURED MEAT IS FULL OF GLUTAMATE 
WHICH IS WHY YOU PICK A PIECE AND YOU WANT ANOTHER BIT 
BOTH CHEFS HAVE LOTS TO DO NOW AND ELISHA DECIDES NOT TO DISCUSS WHY HIS CURED MEAT IS SO DELICIOUS 
I DO SEE WHERE HE'S COMING FROM AND I DO SEE HIS POINT OF VIEW 
TO A POINT BUT NOW ISN'T A GOOD TIME FOR NUTRITIONAL EDUCATION 
I JUST WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON MY DISH 
O. K. CHRIS I'VE GOT SIX MINUTES AND I'M GONNA GO O. K. MATE NO PROBS 
PERFECT LOOKING GOOD 
CHRIS IS PREPARING HIS MYSTERIOUS APPETITE ENHANCING AMINO GINSENG BUBBLES 
THIS TIME HE'S USING ANOTHER PLANT BASED MILK SUBSTITUTE 
WELL IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE MILK 
AND THEN ADDS THE LIQUID AMINO 
WHAT SAUCE IS THAT CHRIS IT'S LIQUID AMINO FOAM 
SO BASICALLY IT'S A PLANT BASED WAY OF GETTING AMINO ACIDS 
ONCE IT'S MIXED THE GINSENG POWDER IS ADDED 
AND THE MAGIC POTION IS COMPLETE 
WITH THE AMINO GINSENG READY IT'S TIME FOR CHRIS TO COOK HIS 
BROAD BEANS WITH SOME GARLIC PUREE AND HIS CONFIDENTIAL CREAM 
ALL HE HAS TO DO NOW IS BLITZ HIS HEDGE HERBS INTO A PUREE 
AND HE'S READY TO PLATE UP 
ELISHA'S APPROACHING THE FINISHING LINE TOO 
COATING HIS SHRIMP AND LANGOUSTINE DUMPLINGS 
IN SEASONED BREADCRUMBS BEFORE DEEP FRYING THEM 
NOT THE KIND OF EQUIPMENT CHRIS LIKES TO USE 
ELISHA NOW REVEALS HIS OWN MAGIC INGREDIENT FOR THE TURBOT SAUCE 
AND THERE'S NO WAY CHRIS CAN IGNORE THIS OPPORTUNITY 
SO YOU'RE DOING BURGER AND WHAT 
BURGER FISH MUSHY PEAS YEAH 
BUT DESPITE CHRIS'S TEASING ELISHA IS READY TO PLATE UP FIRST 
AND LAYS DOWN A BASE OF FENNEL PUREE AND CONFIT 
HE THEN ADDS THE TURBOT AND VENISON HAM 
FOLLOWED BY THE FRIED SHRIMP AND LANGOUSTINE DUMPLINGS 
FINALLY HE DRESSES THE PLATE WITH SOME TURBOT SAUCE AND FENNEL SHOOTS 
CHRIS STARTS BY PAINTING HIS PLATE 
WITH A STREAK OF BRIGHT GREEN HEDGE HERB PUREE 
HE NOW ADDS THE CREAM AND GARLIC BROAD BEANS 
POACHED BABY FENNEL AND FINALLY HIS LING 
THEN IN TRUE CHRIS STYLE HE DRESSES THE PLATE WITH MORE HEDGE HERBS 
FLOWERS AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST HIS AMINO GINSENG BUBBLES 
THAT LOOKS VERY SUMMERY 
THIS LOOKS INTERESTING FANTASTIC 
AND THERE WE HAVE THE SOUTH WEST'S ENTRIES FOR THE FISH COURSE 
ELISHA CARTER'S TURBOT AND VENISON HAM 
AND CHRIS HORRIDGE'S LING WITH HEDGE HERBS 
LET'S GO THEN LET'S TASTE 
THE FIRST TO GO IS ELISHA'S FISH COURSE 
CHRIS TAKES HIS PLATE OF VENISON AND TURBOT INTO A SEPARATE ROOM 
SO HE CAN REALLY SPEAK HIS MIND 
AND IT DOESN'T TAKE HIM LONG TO FIND FAULT 
I WOULD EXPECT TO FIND THIS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
THE SURF AND TURF THING HAS BEEN DONE OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
THERE'S SOME TRUTH IN THAT BUT HE'S NOT STOPPING THERE 
IF I GOT THIS PRESENTATION WISE 
I'D THINK I'D GOT SOME PAXO STUFFING BALLS HERE IN FRONT OF ME 
WHAT'S REALLY SAD IS HE'S TAKEN FANTASTIC SCOTTISH LANGOUSTINES 
AND TURNED THEM INTO THAT 
SO WHAT'S ELISHA'S TAKE ON IT 
THE REASON I WANT TO LEAVE IT IN A DUMPLING IS THAT 
YOU'VE GOT A NICE SUBTLE STEAMED FISH 
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A NICE SUBTLE POACHED LANGOUSTINE 
COS EVERYONE DOES THAT 
THERE'S TRUTH IN THAT TOO 
BUT HOW DOES IT TASTE 
TASTES LIKE BROWN SHRIMP AND LANGOUSTINE 
NOT TOO BAD THEN BUT WHAT ABOUT THE VENISON AND TURBOT 
WHEN I TASTED THE VENISON EARLIER IT WAS QUITE POWERFUL 
REALLY NICE ACTUALLY 
I DON'T THINK THE COOKING'S REALLY DOING ANYTHING FOR IT 
I SUSPECT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THE LIQUID FROM THE FISH HAS WASHED OUT THE SALT 
AND SOME OF THE FLAVOUR FROM THE VENISON HERE 
WELL CHRIS ISN'T IMPRESSED BUT ELISHA OBVIOUSLY IS 
FLAVOURS ARE PHENOMENAL 
THEY'RE REALLY SUBTLE DELICIOUS MOREISH GORGEOUS 
DOES CHRIS AGREE WITH ANY OF THAT 
THE FENNEL'S ACTUALLY COOKED NICELY 
FLAVOUR'S A LITTLE BIT WATERY 
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE FUTURE OF BRITISH FOOD FRANKLY 
BUT WHATEVER CHRIS THINKS ELISHA HAS HIGH HOPES FOR IT 
IF IT GETS THROUGH TO THE GHERKIN RIGHT AND THEY TASTE THIS 
THEY'LL SAY FANTASTIC 
NOW IT'S HIS TURN TO TRY CHRIS'S POACHED LING 
SO WHAT DOES THIS UNUSUAL FISH TASTE LIKE 
IT'S O. K. 
IT'S NOT AS FLAVOURSOME AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 
I DON'T THINK LING'S THE BEST FISH FOR A BANQUET TURBOT'S THE BEST FOR A BANQUET 
WELL OF COURSE BUT IS CHRIS HAPPY 
VERY CLEAN VERY FRESH YOU CAN SEE IT'S ALL FLAKING APART 
BEAUTIFULLY MOIST IN THERE THAT MEANS IT'S NICELY COOKED 
WHAT ABOUT THE MAGIC CREAM SUBSTITUTE 
NORMAL CREAM WHEN IT'S REDUCED DOWN IT COMES TOGETHER NICELY 
THIS LOOKS QUITE CLOGGY 
CLOGGY THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD AND THE REST OF THE DISH 
THE HEDGE HERBS HAVE GOT SO MUCH ZING IN IT 
IT DOES GIVE SOME JUSTICE TO THE FISH IT'S VERY REFRESHING 
THAT'S MORE POSITIVE AND CHRIS IS OBVIOUSLY PLEASED 
IF YOU CAN PRODUCE A DISH LIKE THIS GREAT FLAVOURS GREAT LOOKING 
AND WITH THAT NUTRITIONAL ELEMENT YET AGAIN WE'RE ON TO A WINNER 
BUT IS IT WORTHY OF THE BANQUET 
IT DOESN'T FIT INTO MY MIND AS MEMORABLE 
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED 
IN A BANQUET THEY'RE CONCERNED ON LOOKING GOOD TASTING GOOD 
HOWEVER CHRIS WANTS TO GET TO THAT STAGE IT'S UP TO HIM 
I WANT TO GET TO THAT STAGE IT LOOKS GOOD TASTES GOOD AND THEY SAY WOW 
BUT IT'S THE JUDGES THEY HAVE TO IMPRESS THIS WEEK 
AND WE'LL HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY ON FRIDAY 
TOMORROW THE TEMPERATURE RISES 
AS THE TWO RIVALS FIGHT IT OUT OVER THE MAIN COURSE 
WHAT'S THAT SMOKING YOU'VE OPENED MY EYES 
I NEVER SEEN SMOKING DONE LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE 
THE COMPETITION CONTINUES TOMORROW ON GREAT BRITISH MENU 
JUST TALK TO US 
IF I TELL THE WORLD 
I'LL NEVER SAY ENOUGH 
COS IT WAS NOT SAID TO YOU 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED TO DO 
IF I END UP WITH YOU 
TALK 
HOLBY BLUE BEING A GOOD COP IS JUST THE HALF OF IT
