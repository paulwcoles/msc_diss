GOOD AFTERNOON ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN IS THE MAGIC 
NUMBER IN SNOOKER OVER THE YEARS 
AT NUMBER CAPPING SIX MAXIMUM BREAKS 
KNOCKED IN AT THE CRUCIBLE THE 
AWARD OF FOUR KNOCKING ONE IN HIS 
AS LUCRATIVE AS EVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
TOTAL JACKPOT IT IS NO WONDER THAT 
THE PLAYERS HAVE BEEN ON MAX ATTACK 
IN THE FIRST WEEK 
A MAGNIFICENT ATTEMPT 
AT A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN COMES TO AN END 
YOU HAVE THE IT SHOULD TEN THOUSAND 
TAKING IT UP TO ONE SHE IS FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
WE HAVE HAD FIVE REALLY GOOD 
CHANCES HERE 
YOU'RE KIDDING ME HE 
HAD DONE ALL THE HARD WORK 
I HONESTLY THOUGHT I WOULD BE A 
NERVOUS WRECK TO BE HONEST WITH 
YOU I WAS AS CALM AS ANYTHING THE 
CLOSER I GOT TO IT THE I GOT 
THE PLAYERS MAY BE OUTSIDE THE TOP 
TWELVE ARE NOT STRUGGLING TO EARN A 
LIVING BUT TO GET ONE HUNDRED IT IS SEVEN THOUSAND 
IT WOULD BE MORE PRIZE MONEY THAN 
THEY HAVE HAD IT FOR AL COUPLE OF SEASONS 
IT WASN'T TO BE IT WAS GOOD TO GET SO CLOSE AND 
REALLY GIVE IT I HAVE NEVER REALLY 
GONE FOR THEM HERE WHEN I POTTED 
THE BLACK TO GO FORTY I THOUGHT IT 
WAS A CHANCE SEVEN REDS SEVEN BLACKS 
AS SOON AS YOU GET IN AT AND AROUND 
THE BLACK ARE THESE TABLES ARE SO 
FAST IN ONE BUT TWO SHOTS YOU CAN 
GET THE BALLS IN A DECENT POSITION 
IT IS ALWAYS WORTH GOING FOR 
THE FACT THAT FOR ALL HAS BEEN 
STRENGTHENED MEANS THE TABLE IS 
RUNNING TRUE OF THE DRAW HAS 
BEEN STRENGTHENED 
I SHOULD HAVE JUST PLAYED THE SHOT 
AND THEN IT COULD HAVE BEEN 
DIFFERENT UNLUCKY 
ALL THE PLAYERS IN THE CLUB KNOW 
THAT I HAVE NOT GOT THE BOTTLE TO 
GET A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN I THINK I PUNCHED 
SOMETHING IN THE TOILET L. DON'T 
KNOW I DIDN'T LOOK TO SEE WHAT IT 
WAS 
I THINK THERE WILL BE ONE THIS WAS WEEK I THINK ALL THE PLAYERS ARE 
PLAYING VERY WELL IT WOULD 
SURPRISE ME AT THERE WAS TWO 
I THINK THE PLAYERS ARE MUCH MORE 
PROFICIENT AT MAKING ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BREAK 
BUILDING IN GENERAL IS BETTER 
CLOTHS ARE THINNER SO THE BALLS TO 
SPREAD OPEN MORE BUT GENERALLY 
THE PLAYERS ARE GOING FOR IT MORE 
OFTEN IN A MATCH IN THE OLD DAYS 
THEY WOULDN'T DARE NOW PLAYERS 
MUCH MORE AWARE 
BIG PRIZE MONEY 
BETTER THAN THE RUNNER UP 
THAT IS 
AFFECTING THE PLAYERS AT'S 
MENTALITY THERE WAS A TIME WHEN 
YOU WOULD SAY NOT TO SACRIFICE THE 
FRAME PLAYERS ARE NOW TAKING A BIT 
MORE OF A RISK BECAUSE THE PRIZE 
MONEY IS A LOT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE 
PERHAPS TOO MUCH IT IS NOT 
SPOILING SNOOKER BECAUSE OF IT DO DO YOU THINK SOMEONE IS GOING TO MAKE 
ONE BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT IS OVER 
THE BOOK MAKERS ARE SAYING THAT 
EVERY OTHER TOURNAMENT THERE IS 
GOING TO BE ONE WITH THE LIKES OF 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HE CAN MAKE TWO 
EASILY THAT IS THE NEXT PHASE 
THERE IS PLENTY OF CANDIDATES LEFT 
IN THE DRAW TO MAKE A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
THEY ARE PLAYING FOR 
A PLACE IN THE QUARTER FINALS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AND MARK WILLIAMS 
HAVE BOTH WON THIS TITLE TWICE 
THEY START OFF TONIGHT JOE SWAIL 
IS A TWO TIME SEMI FINALIST LIANG 
WENBO KNOCKED OUT KEN DOHERTY 
SHAUN MURPHY IS FORMER CHAMPION 
BUT IS IN REAL DIFFICULTY PETER 
EBDON WAS THE FIRST MAN THROUGH TO 
THE QUARTER FINALS FOR THE TENTH 
TIME NEIL ROBERTSON AND STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE SHOULD BE ONE OF THE BEST 
PLAYERS OF THIS SECOND ROUND ONE 
OF THE BEST TIES 
I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF COMMENTATING 
ON IT JOHN HIGGINS AGAINST RYAN DAY 
WHAT A MATCH THAT HAS BEEN IT IS 
NOW EIGHT TO EIGHT 
STEPHEN HENDRY GOT OFF TO A GREAT 
START AND LOOKS TO BE BACK TO HIS 
BRILLIANT BEST WHAT CAN THE YOUNG 
CHINESE SENSATION PULL OFF IN THE 
FINAL SESSION 
ESSEX TYUMEN ALI CARTER IS A 
TRAINEE PILOT AND HE IS IN COMMAND 
AGAINST FORMER CHAMPION SHAUN 
MURPHY SO FAR GLOUCESTER'S STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE IS ARGUABLY PLAYER OF THE 
SEASON AT GLASGOW'S MORE FIRST 
CLASS COACHING TIPS FROM TWO WORLD 
CHAMPIONS IN HOUR AT SHEFFIELD 
TRAINING SESSION 
GARY LINEKER OWNS UP TO A MISSPENT 
YOUTH AND IT IS ALL WILLIE 
THORNE'S BOARD APPARENTLY 
IT WAS 
PART OF MY GROWING UP SNOOKER L. 
PLAYED A HELL OF A LOT FROM THE AGE 
OF ABOUT FOURTEEN FIFTEEN ESPECIALLY WHEN I 
STARTED FOOTBALL L. USED TO GO 
TRAINING IN THE MORNING EVERY 
AFTERNOON I WOULD GO TO WILLIE 
THORNE'S SNOOKER CENTRE AND PLAY 
FOR HOURS 
WHICH SNOOKER PUNDIT 
WILL BECOME SNOOKER MASTER MAN TO 
SNOOKER MASTERMIND 
I KNOW IT NO 
FOUR YEARS AGO RYAN DAY MADE HIS 
DEBUT AT THE CHRIS TIKRIT IS QUITE 
AN IMPRESSION HE ALMOST KNOCKED 
OUT A CERTAIN JOHN HIGGINS JOHN IS 
THE DEFENDING CHAMPION AND RYAN IS 
ONE OF THE MOST IMPROVED AND 
IMPROVING PLAYERS ON THE CIRCUIT 
LET'S REMIND YOU HOW THAT MATCH HAS 
BEEN GOING 
IT LOOKED AS IF JOHN HIGGINS WAS 
GOING TO BE A LOT FURTHER IN FRONT IT LOOKS LIKE SIX TO THREE TO HIGGINS 
DAY TAKES THE FRAME TO REDUCE HIS 
ARREARS 
YOU'D DON'T SEE HIM DO THAT VERY 
OFTEN 
JOHN HIGGINS IS STILL ANNOYED RYAN 
DAY HAS WON THE LAST THREE FRAMES 
TO LEVEL THE MATCH THE FINAL INSULT 
IT WAS A BIT OVER SLASH A BIT OF A 
SLASH JOHN HIGGINS REGAINS THE 
LEAD 
AFTER TWO OF THE THREE SESSIONS IT 
IS EIGHT EIGHT OVERNIGHT 
EIGHTY TIME RANKING EVENT OF FINALIST 
BIDDING FOR HIS FIRST QUARTER FINAL 
APPEARANCE RIOT DYNAMITE DAY 
AND A HIS OPPONENT A MASTER OF THE 
MODERN GAME HE IS THE TOP DOG 
WORLD NUMBER ONE AND DEFENDING 
WORLD CHAMPION OR THE WIZARD OF 
WISHAW JOHN HIGGINS 
THAT WAS THE SCENE 
WHEN THEY RETURNED IT THIS MORNING 
FIRST TO THIRTEEN WILL PROGRESS 
THERE ARE OTHER STATS TO CONSIDER 
JUST HAVE GOT TO BELIEVE THE 
SCOREBOARD 
I AGREE WITH YOU BUT USUALLY WHEN 
A PLAYER IS LEVEL WITH SOMEBODY OR 
IN FRONT THEY WILL BOTH GO FOR NINETY 
PER CENT HE'S A GREAT POTTER RYAN 
DAY PROVISIONALLY WORLD NUMBER 
SEVEN SO HE IS ON HIS WAY UP THE 
ONLY THING THAT WORRIES ME ABOUT 
HIM NOW AND AGAIN HE STRUGGLES TO 
GET OVER THE LINE HE IS CERTAINLY 
A FUTURE WINNER OF AL TOURNAMENT 
WHETHER IT IS THIS ONE REMAINS TO 
BE SEEN 
YOU WILL NOT SEE MANY BETTER SHOT 
THAN THAT THAT WAS DROP DRAW 
THAT WAS TOP DRAWER PROBABLY THE 
ONLY RED HE COULD GET ON 
MAGNIFICENT THAT THE WOULD BE IN 
MY TOP THREE SHOTS OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP THAT ONE 
WITH THE BLACK BEING OUT OF PLAY 
HE IS ALREADY LOOKING AT HITTING 
THE PINK 
ONCE AGAIN THE YOUNGER PLAYERS 
TEND TO HIT IT A LOT HARDER FOR ME 
THAT WAS OVERHIT L. KNOW THE PINK 
AND BLACK HAVE COME OUT BUT THE 
REDS ALWAYS SEEMED TO PUSH TOWARDS 
THE POCKET AT THAT SPEED 
THE BLACK GOES SO IT IS NOT BAD I 
THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN UNLUCKY OR HAD 
HE DONE TOO HARD HIT THEM TOO 
HOT 
HE HAS MISSED JUDGED THAT I 
PRESUME HE THOUGHT HE COULD JUST 
STUN PAST THAT RED DON'T THINK 
HE IS ON THAT RED NOW HE'S LOOKING 
AT THE POSSIBILITY OF A THREE BALL 
PLANT IT LOOKS ON NOW THAT IS BONUS 
STILL NOT QUITE OUT OF THE WOODS 
YET 
HE HAS JUST NOT GOT THAT PERFECT 
POSITION WHICH WOULD SET UP FRAME WINNING OPPORTUNITY HERE 
HE COULD POT A FALL TO RISK PLAYING 
FOR THE BLACK HE COULD NOT AFFORD 
HE COULD NOT REACH THE PINK WITHOUT 
USING THE REST THE BLUE MAKE MAKE 
IT AWKWARD CUEING IT IS JUST 
MAKING IT ALL WILL ODD THE PINK 
IS THE BETTER GO TO PUT TO GET 
GUARANTEED POSITION THE BETTER 
BIRD TO PUT IT BALL TO POT 
DURING HIGGINS IS A GREAT DURING 
HIGGINS IS A GREAT CHAMPION JOHN 
WHAT A MISS THAT WAS HE HAS MISSED 
A BLACK OFF THE SPOT HOW COSTLY 
COULD THAT BE 
YOU MENTIONED HE WAS 
FOUR TO ZERO BEHIND AND THE TURNING POINT 
WAS WHEN HE MADE THE COMEBACK THAT 
COULD BE ANOTHER TURNING POINT 
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ALL FANS OF DRY 
AND THE 
IT COULD 
BE AGAINST THEM AT 
THIS TIME RYAN DAY 
BUT TWO REDS ON THE BACK CUSHION 
ARE EASILY POTABLE ON IF THE BACK 
IF THE BLACK IS ON ITS SPOT HE 
NEEDS A BOUNCE AND HE HAS NOT GOT 
ONE THAT IS NO GOOD L. THINK HE 
WAS PLAYING WITH REVERSE SIDE AND 
NOTHING HAPPENED 
THERE WAS SOME 
CONTACT BUT IT DID NOT INSTANTLY 
COME BACK HE HAS CUT THE BLACK BUT 
THE POTTING ANGLE TAKES HIM AWAY 
FROM THE REDS THE RED TO THE LEFT 
CENTRE IS TOO DIFFICULT IT WILL 
TAKE A GOOD SHOT TO GET POSITION ON 
THE NEXT RED 
HE HAS DECIDED TO 
MAKE SURE HE WILL NEED A GOOD 
SAFETY NO THOSE REDS ARE EASILY 
ACCESSIBLE NOW THE BLACK IS BACK ON 
ITS SPOT THERE POSITIONAL PURPOSES 
THAT IS BEAUTIFUL SAFETY PLAY L. 
THINK HE HAS TAKEN OVER FROM STEVE 
DAVIS AS THE BEST TACTICAL PLAYER 
IN THE GAME 
THAT'S ALWAYS THE DANGER WHEN THE 
OBJECT BOLL IS SO CLOSE TO THE 
CUSHION IT COULD HAVE BEEN EASIER 
FOR A JOHN HIGGINS THIS IS HALF A CHANCE FOR RYAN DAY 
IF HE POTS THE BLUE HE WILL NEED 
ONE MORE RED AND THE BLACK AND THAT 
WILL LEAVE JOHN HIGGINS NEEDING 
SNOOKERS 
I DON'T THINK HE CAN FINISH THE 
PINK FROM THE OTHER SIDE NO THAT 
WAS A GOOD SHOT TWENTY NINE POINTS IN FRONT ROSTOCK 
RED BLACK PINK WOULD BE SUFFICIENT 
THAT SOUNDED A BIT FUNNY THAT PUTS HIM THIRTY SEVEN IN FRONT WITH THIRTY FIVE REMAINING 
AND THE SNOOKER TODAY BARRING THE 
SNOOKER RYAN DAY HAS TAKEN THE 
FIRST FRAME OF THE MORNING 
THE TWENTY EIGHT 
YEAR OLD WELSHMAN WAS RUNNER UP IN 
THE FIRST TWO WINNER OF THE SEASON 
AND HE 
IS DEFENDING 
A WELL IN THE 
LAST TOURNAMENT OF THE SEASON 
LET'S RETURN TO THE ACTION 
RYAN DAY IS AN AGGRESSIVE BREAK 
BUILDER HE DOES NOT HAVE THE ANGLE 
HERE 
THAT IS SURE HE HAS GOT SECOND 
PRIZE HERE 
THAT IS A BONUS HE PLAYED FOR THE 
BLUE IN THE RIGHT MIDDLE AND WELL 
EFFECT ON IT NO EFFECT 
MAYBE HE COULD HAVE DONE WITH 
STUNNING THAT THROUGH A LITTLE BIT 
MORE HE MIGHT NEED TO PUT IT 
POLICE OF SIDE ON AND IF YOU DO 
THAT THE BLACK IS DEFINITELY 
MISSABLE 
HE HAS DONE WELL HE HAS GOT A RED 
FOR STARTERS IF YOU LISTEN THE 
REDS YOU JUST LOOKING FOR THAT ONE 
RED TO GO ON HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU 
FINISH UP ON NOTHING HE HAS GOT 
ONE TO THE LEFT OF THE YELLOW 
POSITION GUARANTEED IF IT GOES IN 
HE USED A FULL OF THE POCKET A 
ROW OVER THE POCKET WE HAVE SEEN 
THAT SHOT SO MANY TIMES ABSOLUTELY 
RYAN DAY IS BLESSED WITH SUCH A 
WONDERFUL CUEING ACTION HE IS NOT 
FAR AWAY FROM THE SUGGESTION THAT 
HE COULD BE A REGULAR TOURNAMENT 
WINNER THAT IS HOW TO WELL HE CUES 
HE'S ONE OF THE TOP THREE OR FOUR 
PLAYERS IN THE BREAK BUILDING 
DEPARTMENT ON CURRENT FIRM BUT 
THE TENSION GETS TO EVERYBODY ON 
CURRENT FOUND FORM 
HE HAS JUST 
HAD HIS TWENTY EIGHT BUT THEY TWENTY EIGHTH BIRTHDAY 
ARE THEY USED TO SAY YOU DID NOT 
REACH YOUR PEAK IN THIS GAME UNTIL 
YOU'RE EARLY THIRTIES BUT STEVE DAVIS 
AND JIMMY WHITE MADE US REALISE 
THAT YOU DO IT HAVE TO BE IN EUROPE 
THERE THESE YOU DO IT HAVE TO BE 
IN YOU'RE THIRTIES 
WE SHOULD GIVE THESE PLAYERS ARE A 
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO LEARN ABOUT 
THE GAME AND TO LEARN ABOUT 
THEMSELVES AND THEIR TEMPERAMENT 
IT IS NOT EASY OUT THERE PLAYING A 
GREAT PLAYER LIKE JOHN HIGGINS 
RYAN HAS PROVED A LOT TO HIMSELF IN 
THIS MATCH OCT T. EVEN GET BACK IN 
THE MATCH FROM THAT POSITION HE 
HAS DONE VERY WELL NO HE HAS A 
CHANCE TO GO THIS MIGHT FRAMES 
CLEAR THEN THAT IS ALWAYS BEEN THE 
MEMORY BANK IN THE MEMORY BANK 
HE HAS STILL GOT THE WENT TO THE 
LEFT MIDDLE BUT HE IS HAMPERED 
WITH THE CUE GIRL THE CUE AGO 
BALL YOU FEEL THAT HE IS A COUPLE 
OF GOOD POTS AWAY FROM CLINCHING 
THIS SECOND FRAME OF THE SESSION 
STRIKING DOWN LIKE THAT IS NEVER AN 
EASY SHOT I'M SURPRISED HE PLAYED 
IT THAT HARD L. THOUGHT HE WOULD 
ROLL IT IN ADDED WEIGHT DEAD 
WEIGHT 
THE ONLY WAY THAT IT DOES WEIGHT NOT BRINGS IS IF YOU PLAY IT SLOW 
A BONUS BOUNCE HE HAS PLAYED 
THE FOOL WILL KISS THE WEIGHT HAS 
COME INTO PLAY SO THERE FORTY ONE POINT 
LEAD IS NOT ENOUGH 
HE'S CLOSER TO THE CUSHION THAN HE 
WOULD RATHER BE BUT BETTER THAT 
THAN IN OFF 
NOT VERY OFTEN CAN YOU SAY THAT IS A GOOD 
KICK BUT 
THAT WAS A GOOD 
KICK HE WAS HORRIFIED WHEN HE SAW 
THE KICK BUT HIS DEMEANOUR CHANGED 
WHEN HE REALISED THAT THE KICK TAKEN THE PACE OUT OF IT 
THIS IS A MASSIVE FRAME EVERY 
FRAME IS MASSIVE IN THE BEST OF TWENTY FIVE 
LAST SESSION BUT THE FACT THAT HE 
SHOULD HAVE WON THIS GAME RYAN 
COULD HALT HIM HURT 
IT'S GOTTA A SIMILAR PATTERN TO THE 
FIRST FRAME THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS 
THAT JOE AND HAS THE REDS ARE 
NICELY PLACED JEROME JOHN 
HE DID NOT GET INTO THE CUE BALL 
ENOUGH THERE 
HE WANTED TO BE STRAIGHTER ON THIS 
RED LOVE CLOSE OF COURSE WELL THERE IS A SURPRISE 
I DON'T THINK I HAVE EVER SEEN HIM 
MISS AN EASY ROLE LIKE THAT HE IS 
USUALLY A VERY EFFICIENT IN 
CLEANING UP WHEN HE KNOWS THAT 
THAT IT WILL HURT HIS OPPONENT 
RYAN DAY NOW HAS A CHANCE TO BEAT 
THE WORLD CHAMPION 
HE HAS GOT THE OPENING RED AND HE 
HAS GOT A TWENTY POINT LEAD CHOICE OF 
PINK OR BLACK NICE ANGLE AND 
MOAT IF THE REDS WERE IN THE 
MIDDLE 
OF THE TABLE 
THIS WOULD BE 
MIDDLE OF THE TABLE THIS WOULD BE A FORMALITY 
JUST LOOKING BACK TO THE POOR 
POSITIONAL SHOT FROM JOHN HIGGINS 
I THINK THE RED HE'S CLOSEST TO 
WILL GO TO THIS CORNER POCKET 
PLAYING IT INTO A BLIND POCKET IT 
IS A TESTY ONE HE NEEDS THE PINK AND ONE MORE RED 
UP RYAN DAY MADE A MISTAKE IN THE 
FIRST FRAME MISSING BLACK OFF 
JOHN HIGGINS 
COULD NOT CAPITALISE 
DIDN'T HAVE THE PERFECT ANGLE ON 
THE PINK HE'S THIRTY FOUR AHEAD WITH THIRTY FIVE 
REMAINING 
THERE WILL BE NO HEROICS HERE WITH 
THE CUE BALL HE WILL LEAVE IT 
TIGHT TO 
THE CUSHION 
IN CASE 
SOMETHING AMISS WENT ALONE WENT 
ON FROM HIGGINS HAD A GOOD CHANCE 
IN THIS FRAME IT COULD BE THIS 
BLACK ZERO EITHER WAY BUT RYAN DAY 
HAS WON BOTH FRAMES TWO TO ZERO EITHER 
WAY JOHN HIGGINS IS GOING TO HAVE 
TO A DEEP DID VERY VERY DEEP NO 
DIG VERY DEEP NOW 
ROUTINES COULD HAVE GROWN BY THE 
WAY THIS WINNING BUT RYAN DAY WILL 
BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE WON THEM BOTH 
UP JOHN HIGGINS IN TROUBLE 
IT IS A 
DISCONSOLATE JOHN HIGGINS WHO IS 
NOW HAVING TO DO THE CHASING 
YESTERDAY THE REIGNING CHAMPION 
VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE WAY THE 
CUSHIONS WERE PLAYING ON TABLE AND 
THE 
LACK THINGS 
THAT IT SEEMED 
THE LACK THINGS THAT IT SEEMED TO BE 
IMPROVING ON THAT 
SCORE IN THE 
NEXT FRAME TABLE POOLE TABLE 
ONE 
LOOK AT THAT CUSHION 
BUT LE THE 
PERFECT BASE TO GO IT LOOKED THE 
PERFECT PACE TO GO IN BEHIND THE 
YOU KNOW 
AND IT 
HAS FINISHED TWO 
FEET AWAY YELLOW 
YES THAT IS 
SLOWING DOWN TOWARDS THE YELLOW 
AND THEN IT HAS CLEARLY HIT THE 
BLUE 
HE WENT THERE HAVE WORRIED BLUE ABOUT IT IF THAT RED HAD GROWN IN 
LOOK AT AND HIGGINS' HER FACE HE 
CANNOT BELIEVE IT 
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HALF AN INCH 
PASS THE BALL LINE AND IT HAS BEEN 
EIGHTEEN INCHES PAST THE BALL CLIMB 
UNBELIEVABLE THE BULK LYING 
BAULK LINE 
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU 
STRUGGLE TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN 
WHAT DOES THE CUE BALL FINISHED IN 
A POSITION WHERE IT IS OFFERED 
AGAIN AWKWARD THAT WAS TOP 
DRAWER A GREAT RED AND AN EVEN 
BETTER BLUE 
AND IN OFF WAS A 
DISTINCT POSSIBILITY TERRIFIC SHOW 
FROM JOHN HIGGINS LAST YEAR IN THE 
SEMI FINAL AGAINST EITHER NICOLA IF 
HE TRAILED FOURTEEN TO TEN AGAINST STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE AND IT'S JUST FELL TO THE 
CUSHION TERRIFIC POSITIONAL SHOT 
IT SEEMED HE GOT THE EXTENSION BUT 
WHEN THE CUE AT FULL STRETCH THE 
RED WENT OFF 
THE SIDE CUSHION ON ON THE LAST GAME HE HAD HALF BODED 
BELOW THE PINK WITH THE EXTENSION 
WHICH SHE ALSO MISSED IT IS 
CERTAINLY NOT HIS FAVOURITE COOL AT 
THE MOMENT IT COULD HAVE COST HIM 
THIS FRAME TOOL 
YOU CANNOT 
AFFORD TO MAKE MISTAKES LIKE THAT 
IT IS FRUSTRATING FOR HIM SITTING 
IN THAT SEAT THAT WAS A CHANCE TO 
GET BACK IN THE FRAME 
NICELY JUDGED POSITIONAL SHOT FROM 
BRIAN RYAN 
PLENTY OF ROOM TO GO BEFORE THE FIT 
THERE THE SHAKE OF THE HEAD 
RYAN BECAUSE HE KNEW HE HAD PLENTY 
OF ROOM HE CAN JUST SCREW BACK 
INTO THE PINK TO LEAVE THE LIANG 
STRAIGHT RED AS LOW AS HE FINISHED 
STRAIGHT ON THE OTHER RED 
ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT RYAN DAY HE 
GENERATES SO MUCH SPIN WITH 
LITTLE POWER AND THAT IS MASTER CLASS 
LOOK AT THE MOVEMENT HE GOT CLASS ON THAT CUBA WITHOUT ANY EFFORT 
INCH PERFECT ON THIS RED CUBA 
WILL CUE BALL IT IS JUST THE TIMING 
GOING 
THROUGH 
THE BOWEL NOT STOPPING WHEN YOU 
HIT THE BIRD WILL GOING RIGHT 
THROUGH IT HIT THE GO BALL 
EITHER MEMBER THERE WERE TIMES THAT 
YOU COULD PLAY A SCREW SHOTS 
I KNEW 
WHICH DO 
WELL 
TO GET 
THE ACTION ON 
THE CUE BALL IF 
YOU ARE 
CUEING 
WILL IF IT DOES MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD 
CUEING WELL THAT GREEN THAT WE 
SAW EARLIER ON THIS MORNING AS A 
PLAYER IT GIVES YOU A BUZZ WHEN 
YOU HIT THE BOW THAT WELL WINNER 
RED IS ALL THAT'S REQUIRED THE 
NEW RATE ONE MORE RED DURING 
HIGGINS MAYBE SEEING ANOTHER FRAME 
SLIP AWAY JOHN HIGGINS 
UP THAT IS THE FRAME THERE WILL 
THAT IS THE FRAME BALL 
THOSE TWO 
BEAUTIFUL YOU LADIES WEARING THE 
ENGLISH SHOTS ENGLAND SHOTS BUT 
DID WELL WE ARE THE COMMENTATORS 
ARE EARLIER IN THE ELITE 
REFER TO 
THEM 
AS BOYS 
IF IT 
WAS A 
AT ME 
SAID 
THAT BUT 
THE 
LIGHTING IS 
NOT 
SO 
GOOD AND 
CLIVE EVERTON 
HAS BEEN 
STUCK IN HIS COMMENTARY BOX FOR SO 
LOW 
EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES LOW OCCASIONALLY 
JOHN HIGGINS CONCEDES OCCASIONALLY RYAN DAY AND HAS TAKEN THE FIRST 
THREE FRAMES OF THIS SESSION HE NO 
LEADS ELEVEN TO EIGHT AGAINST THE WINNING 
CHAMPION 
THIS IS LOOKING DONE FOR CHAMPION THE TITLE HOLDER 
HE WAS FRIGHTENED OF PLAYING THE 
PUSH SHOT THERE AND IN THE END IN 
AN EFFORT TO GET THE CUE OUT OF THE 
WAY QUICKER THAN NORMAL THE RED 
ONLY WHAT HALF WEIGHT ON ITS 
JOURNEY ONLY WENT HALFWAY ON ITS 
JOURNEY 
THAT IS A FINE EXAMPLE JOHN 
HIGGINS STAYED ON THAT SHOT FOR TEN 
OR FIFTEEN SECONDS KNOWING THAT HE 
COULD PUT RYAN IN A BIT OF TROUBLE 
WITH THE LENGTH OF CUE BALL 
I THINK RYAN DAY IS SELF COACH BUT 
YOU HAVE GOT TO GIVE EVERY SHOT THE 
SAME CONCENTRATION THAT IS A BETTER SHOT 
FUNNILY ENOUGH THE ONES THAT ARE A 
BIT DIFFICULT THEY ARE NOT THE 
PROBLEM IT IS THE ONES WHEN YOU 
WERE IN CLOSE TO THE BALL IS 
UNFORGIVABLE NOT TO FIND THE BAULK 
CUSHION 
HE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A 
SHOT TO NOTHING BUT THE RED HE 
MISSED NOT ANOTHER ONE TO THE BAULK 
END KNOCKED ANOTHER ONE TO THE 
BAULK END A BIT OF PRESSURE HERE 
ON JOHN HIGGINS YOU CERTAINLY 
WOULDN'T THINK HE COULD GET THROUGH 
TO THE POTTING ANGLE OF THAT RED IN 
NEAR THE GREEN IF HE PLAYS THIS 
POT IT IS A BIG SHOT TO TAKE ON 
JOHN HIGGINS HAS SHOWN A LOT OF 
COURAGE THERE THAT 
WAS SHOT THAT WAS SEVENTY TO ZERO IN HIS FAVOUR A BIG 
SHOT THAT YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU 
GET OFF SHOT LIKE THAT A A BRILLIANT SHOT AND THE FIRST TIME 
THIS MORNING IN THE FRAME THAT HE 
HAS GOT IN FIRST 
THE GOOD THING FOR JOHN HERE IS 
THAT THE PINK IS AVAILABLE INTO 
BOTH CORNERS SO HE CAN STILL WIN 
THE FRAME WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT 
THE BLACK THIS IS HUGE FRAME FOR JOHN HIGGINS 
HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO SHOW EVERY 
INCH OF CHARACTER TO GET BACK INTO 
THIS MATCH 
JUST LOST THE WHITE A TOUCH HE CAN 
PLAY THE SLOW HOLDING SHOT FOR THE 
PINK IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER BUT HE 
WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE BEEN DEAD 
STRAIGHT ON THIS SO HE WOULDN'T 
HAVE HAD TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE 
CUE BALL 
THAT IS THE THIRD TIME HE HAS USED 
THE EXTENSION THE PREVIOUS TWO 
WERE MISSED 
IT OFTEN HAPPENS SOME TIME IN 
FRAMES THAT THE FIRST FORTY ARE NICE 
EASY AND THE NEXT FORTY ARE DIFFICULT 
IT IS ONE OF THE OCCASIONS WHEN HE 
WILL HAVE TO START WORKING YOU 
HAVE TO MOVE REDS TO MAKE OTHER 
REDS POT THIS IS HIS HIGHEST BREAK 
OF THE MORNING 
WHAT HE WOULDN'T DO FOR A FRAME 
WINNING BREAK HERE 
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO PLAY ANY KISSES 
AT THE SIDE OF THE TABLE 
THE TOP RED OF THE TWO TO THE RIGHT 
OF THE BLACK SPOT WILL POT BUT 
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE CURVE 
PERFECT TO THIS NEXT RED BECAUSE 
OF THE BLACK WHERE IT IS HE IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE THE CUE BALL 
PURPOSELY PLAYING FOR BLUE OR 
BAULK COLOUR RATHER THAN RISKING 
THAT SO BLUE IT IS VIRTUALLY FRAME 
BALL GOOD PERFORMANCE THIS THE 
FIRST RED WAS TOP DRAWER 
WHEN A PLAYER HAS HIS BACK TO THE 
WAR YOU FIND OUT A TRUE CHAMPION 
BACK TO THE WALL 
THIS PROVES WHAT A GREAT CHAMPION 
THIS MAN IS WHAT ABOUT THIS FIRST 
RED 
I SAID AT THE TIME IT WAS A RED MUST GET HE WAS LEAVING REDS ALL 
OVER THE PLACE SO COURAGE AND 
TALENT WON THE DAY REALLY AND 
SET UP THIS MARVELLOUS BREAK 
THAT HAS MADE THE SPORT AT THE 
CENTURY BUT THIS RED WAS WILL POT 
ALONG THE CUSHION THIS RED WILL 
STILL POT ALONG THE CUSHION 
NO CENTURY BUT HIGGINS CAN GO INTO 
THE INTERVAL FEELING MUCH BETTER 
HE HAS KEPT HIMSELF IN THE MATCH 
JOHN HAS SHOWN GREAT TENACITY IN 
TRICKY SITUATIONS BEFORE YOU DO 
NOT WIN TWO WORLD TITLES WITHOUT 
DOING THAT BUT CAN HE KEEP THE 
MOMENTUM GOING NOW 
NOT THE BEST BREAK OFF SHOT FROM 
JOHN HIGGINS LEAVING A CHANCE OF 
THAT RED FOR RYAN DAY KNOCKED IT 
IN CLEAN AS A WHISTLE 
THE RED TO THE RIGHT WILL GO AND 
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY INCH PERFECT 
JUST SLIGHTLY LOST THE CUE BALL 
THERE FOR ME IT IS ALWAYS VERY 
HARD TO OVERHIT THESE BUT I THINK 
YOU HAVE GOT TO WOULD RATHER BE 
ON A YELLOW OR BROWN THAN RISK 
BEING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BLUE 
HE COULD HOLD IT HE HAS GIVEN 
HIMSELF PLENTY TO DO WITH THE CUE 
BALL HE DOESN'T HAVE TO PLAY THIS 
AT PACE THE ONE THAT IS TIED TO 
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE BUNCH 
HE IS PLAYING FOR THE BOTTOM RED 
FOR ME THAT WASN'T A BAD SHOT IT 
WAS THE PREVIOUS ONE 
THOSE LITTLE DRAG SHOTS THEY CAN 
BE A FRACTION OUT 
QUITE A LONG PROTRACTED SAFETY 
EXCHANGE HERE 
I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE IS A 
POINT HERE 
HE HAS GOT TO SNOOKER THAT IS A 
BONUS HE HAS GOT THE SNOOKER 
JOHN HAVING TO BEND THIS AROUND 
THE YELLOW 
HE HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL WHERE THE 
THIRD RED GOES HERE THAT CUSHION 
IS GOING TO HELP HIM NOW THEN THE 
FIRST POT OF THE PREVIOUS FRAME WAS 
BRILLIANT AND LED TO A THREE OH THREE THIS 
POT IS JUST AS DANGEROUS 
I SAY A LITTLE BIT EASIER I 
COULDN'T IMAGINE HIM MISSING THAT 
DOES ANYTHING GO IN THE RIGHT HAND 
CORNER L. DON'T THINK SO 
THERE IS A POT ON AND HE IS BOUND 
TO BE ON THE BLACK JUST MAKE 
CERTAIN OF THE RED ON A BAD DAY YOU'RE GOING OFF 
IT WAS A GOOD POT BUT ONCE HE 
CLIPPED THE BLUE HIS HEART WOULD 
HAVE BEEN IN HIS MOUTH IT HAS WORKED OUT NICELY 
A BIG MOMENT IN THIS MATCH 
AMAZINGLY ENOUGH JOHN HIGGINS HAS 
SCORED MORE POINTS THAN RUN RYAN 
DAY HE IS ON EXACTLY ONE THOUSAND 
AND SHORTLY HIGGINS COULD BE GOING 
TWELVE TO NINE BEHIND 
JUST HAD ENOUGH ANGLE ON THE BLACK 
TO MAKE THE POSITION FOR THE NEXT 
ONE HE HAS GOT TO BE PERFECT ON 
THIS YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL WHEN A 
PLAYER GETS DOWN QUICK THERE IS NO 
PROBLEMS 
RYAN DAY HAS IMPRESSED ME MORE IN 
THIS MATCH THAN FOR THE MOST PART 
OF HIS CAREER HE LOOKS VERY VERY 
SHOT IN HIS PREVIOUS ROUND AGAINST 
MICHAEL JUDGE HE MADE FIVE OR SIX 
BREAKS OVER EIGHTY BUT HE WASN'T DOING 
IT AT FIRST VISIT L. THOUGHT 
AGAINST SOMEONE LIKE JOHN HIGGINS 
HE WOULDN'T GET THAT LOT OF 
CHANCES BUT MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED 
EARLIER ON HE HAS BEEN GETTING IN 
FIRST TIME 
IF HE DOES THAT HE'S GOING TO BE A 
MATCH FOR ANYBODY THAT HAS GONE 
SLIGHTLY ASTRAY NICELY CONTROLLED PROBABLY TWO MORE REDS 
HE IS THINKING ABOUT IT IT IS NOT 
STRAIGHTFORWARD HE HAS GOT TO PLAY 
A GOOD POSITIONAL SHOT HERE 
THIS GIVES HIM A TRICKY RED NOW 
ALONG THE TOP CUSHION THIS IS A 
NERVY ONE THIS COULD BE THE FRAME 
WINNER THERE WAS NO NEED FOR IT 
CAN HE AVOID THE KISS ON THE RED ON 
THE CUSHION HE COULDN'T SO ARE 
STILL A LITTLE BIT OF WORK TO DO 
JOHN HIGGINS MAY THINK HE HAS GOT 
BIT OF POPE HERE HE NEEDS THE 
GREEN 
THE BLUE IS A BIG BALL IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE TABLE IF HE TRIES TO 
STUN ROUND BUT HE HAS GOT A LOVELY 
LINE AND ONE OF THOSE THREE BEHIND 
THE PINK WILL GO 
IN IT GOES JOHN HIGGINS THE 
REIGNING CHAMPION IN BIG TROUBLE 
HE HAS MISSED IT BUT IT CITY TWO IN 
FRONT FIFTY NINE LEFT ON BUT FOR THE 
SNOOKER HE IS ONE AWAY FROM A 
PLACE IN THE QUARTER FINAL 
NOT THE BEST SAFETY SHOT FROM JOHN 
AND HE HAS PUT THE RED OVER THE 
POCKET 
NO SIGN OF NERVES FROM WIND DAY AT 
THE MOMENT 
I HAVE BEEN REALLY 
IMPRESSED I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN WHAT A 
GREAT PLAYER HE IS L. QUESTIONED 
HIS TEMPERAMENT AT THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP BUT NOT TODAY ANOTHER TERRIFIC POT 
HE IS MAKING THE GAME LOOK SIMPLE 
IT IS A LOT EASIER WHEN YOU'RE PAST 
THE WINNING LINE BUT HE HAS CUE 
BEAUTIFULLY THIS MORNING IT HAS TO 
BE SAID HE HAS CUED BEAUTIFULLY BLACK DOESN'T GO IN 
BUT THE WORLD CHAMPION CONCEDES IN 
BIG TROUBLE RYAN DAY JUST LOOKING 
FOR ONE MORE FRAME NOW 
NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO RETAIN HIS 
WORLD TITLE SINCE STEPHEN HENDRY 
IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX JOHN HIGGINS'S CHANCES 
LOOK LIKE THEY ARE SLIPPING AWAY 
FAST WHAT CAN HE DO NOW IN FRAME 
TWENTY TWO 
IS HE BENDING THIS TO PLAY THE POT 
OR PLAY SAFE THAT WAS YOUR ANSWER 
WHEN YOU ARE GOING WELL IT IS 
UNBELIEVABLE NO WAY IN THE WORLD 
WOULD HE HAD CONTEMPLATED GETTING 
ON THE BLACK THERE HE WAS JUST 
TRYING TO PLAY THE RED HE IS IN 
FORM THE BOYS WHEN YOU ARE 
PLAYING THIS WELL YOU DESERVE A 
BIT OF LUCK HE HAD DECENT CUEING IN THE REDS 
IT IS A CASE OF MAKING HAY WHILE 
THE SUN SHOT NOTHING JOHN CAN DO 
ABOUT IT 
YOU FEEL HIS ONLY WAY BACK IS TO 
GET A LITTLE BIT OF HELP FROM HIS 
OPPONENT BUT THAT DOES NOT LOOK 
LIKELY AT THE MOMENT 
THIS IS THE VIEW HE HAD YOU CAN 
SEE THE RED QUARTER BALL HE HAS 
JUST PLAYED THIS SWERVE SHOT AND 
COME OUT INTO OPEN PLAY IN HIS 
WILDEST DREAMS HE COULD NOT HAVE 
EXPECTED TO BE ON THE BLACK KEEP 
AN EYE ON THE CUE BALL YOU THINK 
YOU WILL FINISH IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE TABLE HOW DID HE MANAGE TO GET 
ENOUGH ROOM TO PLAY THE STUN SHOT 
ON THE BLACK EVERYTHING WENT FOR 
HIM THERE 
IT WOULD BE A BIT OF DEFEAT IF HE 
HAD A GO FOR A MAXIMUM IN THE LAST 
FRAME IT WILL EVEN BE IN HIS MIND 
AT THE MOMENT IT WILL NOT EVEN 
BE 
HE WILL PROBABLY PLAY ANOTHER 
CANNON HERE 
THERE IS DEFINITELY A RED AVAILABLE 
TO THE LEFT CORNER HE PLAYED IT 
WITH BIT MORE PACE THAN I WAS 
THINKING BUT HE HAS GOT ON THIS 
RED JUST ABOUT 
LOOK AT THIS LAST 
KISS HE IS NO WHERE THEN ALL OF A 
SUDDEN FLICKED IT FULL BALL 
WHAT A CHANCE HE WILL NOT BE 
THINKING ABOUT MAXIMUMS HERE HE 
LOOKS CALM BUT UNDERNEATH THIS 
WOULD BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
VICTORIES OF HIS CAREER DOESN'T 
WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED 
NOW HE HAS PLAYED FOR THE RED AT 
THE TOP CUSHION SO MAYBE HE HAS 
MAXIMUM IN MIND THERE WORK EASIER 
REDS TO PLAY FOR IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE TABLE 
LAMA I. WAS NO NEED IT HE HAS PUT 
HIMSELF UNDER THE COSH THERE 
PLAYING FOR THAT RED VERY VERY 
SURPRISED THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR 
THE REDS OTHER THAN THIS ONE THAT 
HE COULD HAVE PLAYED FOR 
THAT COULD BE HIS LAST VISIT IT IT JUST WENT TO THE JAW AND HE WAS 
JUST TRIED TO PINCH BIT TO GET 
POSITION THAT SMILE WAS PROBABLY 
WON'T OF RESIGNATION ONE OF 
RESIGNATION 
THIS IS NOT GREAT THE PINK WOULD 
BE THE PERFECT WON'T THE BLACK HE 
CAN GET IN THE SAME POSITION 
IF HE GETS NICELY ON A RED NOW YOU 
WOULD EXPECT HIM TO GO ON AND WIN 
THE WINNER OF STEPHEN HENDRY 
AGAINST JOE DING JUNHUI AWAIT SO 
IT IS NOT GOING TO GET ANY EASIER 
HE COULD BE FACING A SEVEN TIMES 
WORLD CHAMPION IN THE NEXT MATCH 
AFTER BEATING A DOUBLE WORLD 
CHAMPION YOU CAN SEE HIS TO NEED 
CHANGING A BIT NOW HE KNOWS THIS 
IS THE CHANCE YOU CAN SEE HIS 
DEMEANOUR CHANGING 
HE HAS JUST OVERRUN SLIGHTLY HE 
MAY HAVE TO PLAY A LITTLE CANNON 
HERE YOU CAN SEE IT GOING WRONG 
IN GOES THE PINK AND HE IS NICELY 
ON THE RED L. CANNOT SEE HIM MAKING A MISTAKE NOW 
THIS IS 
TRYING BE'S UP EVENTS AT 
THIS IS TRYING BE'S UP EVENTS AT THE CRUCIBLE HE HAS YET TO GET 
PAST THE SECOND REMOTE THIS SHOT 
COULD IT THERE TRYING 
JOHN HIGGINS HAS BEEN EPIC 
AMBASSADOR FOR THE GAME WHAT 
BECAME LET'S GO THE PLAYERS RIGHT 
AND BE HAS BEATEN ONE OF THE ALTAR 
INGRATES MY 
THE THE CHAMPION HAS GONE BUT HE 
WILL BE BACK SOME DISAPPOINTED HE 
PLAYED FOR YOUR LISTLESS AGAINST 
REDUCED EVENTS IN THE FIRST ROUND 
AT BUT BEARDSLEY AGAINST TRYING A 
IN THE FIRST FOUR FRAMES RING HE 
RYAN DAY 
HE'S FINISHING LIKE A CHAMPION 
WILL IT YOU ARE A BREAK OF FORTY EAT 
IN THIS FRAME WHAT A PERFORMANCE 
IT BUSINESS WHEN YOU COME HERE AND 
PRODUCE YOUR BEST TEAM AND THAT IS 
WHAT HE HAS DONE IN 
HE 
IS ACTING PINK OR 
EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE THAT WAS A 
FABULOUS PERFORMANCE HE BEATS THE 
TWO TO MODERN CHAMPION IT GOES INTO THE QUARTER AN 
ANGLE FOR 
THE 
FORCED THE IN IN HIS CAREER 
STILL THERE WILL BE NO LEGAL 
DEFENCE THIS YEAR FROM JOHN HIGGINS 
AFTERWARDS HE HAD PLENTY TO SAY 
ABOUT HIS EXIT 
A VERY LET THE 
CONDITIONS GET TO TOO EASILY 
KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING 
DRASTICALLY WRONG WITH THE TABLE 
IT IS HARD THE GAME IS HOPE IN OR 
SOMETHING IT'S BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO 
SECOND GUESS YOURSELF ABOUT 
SECOND GUESS YOURSELF ABOUT READABLE IS GOING TO COME OFF 
CERTAIN CUSHIONS L. L. LET IT GET TO 
ME GARY SPOKE TO THE ASSISTANT AT 
DO IT ALL ABOUT IT L. WHITTLED THAT 
THEY ARE UNDER ORMOND AND THEY CAN 
ACTUALLY CHANGE THE CLOTHS AS HE 
USED IT TO THE PRESS I AM AT HAVING 
HER AS AN ANSWER THAT WENT TO HER 
EAT THESE PLAY ON HE'S HIGGINS EAT 
THESE CONTINUAL PLAY AT INTO OF 
THINKING THE PINK THE TWENTY STARTS 
INNOCENTLY AND THE TABLES ARE THE 
CLOTH THIS IS A WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
WE ARE PLAYING IT 
OLD HATCH OWN 
WAS AGREED TO SEE THE LEAST IF 
ARENA ROLL UP DURING WAS 
THE TABLES WERE AND ARE YOU THAT 
DOESN'T NECESSARILY STOP THE 
DANCING BRYN SINGH IT IS JUST 
ONE OF THOSE THINGS 
A HEAVE THE TREACLE OR WE 
ACCORDING END OF THE D. TRYING 
THE WHICH WENT HIGGINS ALL THE BITS 
WITH THAT 
JOHN HIGGINS WAS SCATHING IN HIS 
CRITICISM OFF THE TABLES ARE YOU 
UNHAPPY ABOUT THAT 
IT'S HIS 
FRUSTRATING FOR PLAYERS TO HAVE 
BEEN CONSISTENT BOUNCES WE TRIED 
TO HAVE A SCHEDULED RECOVER FOR 
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW TAKING INTO 
CONSIDERATION PAST YEARS IT THIS 
WAY WE HAVE DONE THAT YEARS AGO 
THE TABLES WILL NOT RECOVER IT'S 
DISAPPOINTING THOSE GUYS ARE THERE IT IS DIFFICULT I 
UNDERSTAND BUT 
IT IS WHERE WE ARE 
WHAT ETCHED 
UP 
WHAT IS THE SOLUTION 
IF YOU COULD HAVE BANK SOLUTION NEW CLOTH UPBEAT 
THAT WOULD SLOW 
NEW CLOTH UPBEAT THAT WOULD SLOW DOWN THE CUSHION BRINGS BUT WE'RE 
BECAUSE THE CUSHIONS ARE SO GOOD WE 
HAVE RAISED THE BARRING WHAT EXPECT 
WE HAVE BOUGHT A FAST CLOTH AND 
KITCHENS BUT WHEN SOMETHING PLAYS 
UP A BIT WE GO OVER THE TOP WE'VE 
IN HAVE BIG PROBLEMS WE HAVE GOT A 
GREAT TEAM WALKING ON THESE 
CUSHIONS THE TABLE FIGURES ARE 
FANTASTIC BUT THESE ARE VERY 
TEMPERAMENTAL PEOPLE'S WIN THEY ARE 
SO FAST THAT PINK IT SHOULD BE 
DONE ONCE MORE AFTER THE FIRST 
WING MATCHES THE MATCH SHOULD BE 
DONE AGAIN 
IT IS NOT LIKE WHAT 
YOU'RE GETTING BEST OF NINE YOU 
ARE GUARANTEED 
TO GET 
BEHIND THE 
AIMS AND ONE SECTION MORE SNOOKER 
IS PLAYED AT IT IF A MUCH QUOTED 
IN INCORPORATED WILL STICK IT CLIP HAVE YOU HEARD COMPLAINTS 
THERE HAS BEEN A CLAUSE BUT THIS 
IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT WAS THEY ARE 
COMIC FROM JOHN HIGGINS HE HAS 
COME IN AND HOLD US PETER EBDON 
COMMENTED AS WELL BUT THESE GUYS 
ARE TO KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND COME 
IN A BIT MORE OF THAT WE HAVE GOT 
TO THE 
POINT DID 
THEY WERE JOINED 
FELT BUT 
IT 
WAS UNPLAYABLE 
BUT 
TRYING BEAT IT NOT RHINE BE A 
RYAN DAY CAN YOU LET THIS 
OVERWHELM YOU THAT 
JOHN HIGGINS JOHN WAS VERY FRUSTRATED WITH 
THINGS OUT HERE HE TOOK IT WELL 
HE PUT HIS HER UP TO THE CROWD TO 
SAY GOODBYE HE WAS ALMOST ENOUGH 
TO SAY THAT HE LET THINGS GET TO 
THEM 
THE WORST IDEA IS TO HAVE SEX THEM RECOVERED CUSHIONS ALREADY IN 
TRANSIT KEEP HIM THERE 
RECOVERED CUSHION 
ONE THING WE 
HAVE BOUGHT THIS COST HAS BEEN A 
TOP NOTCH PERFORMANCE FROM RHINO A 
RYAN DAY 
HE HAS BEEN MY DUCK 
COURSE OLDER TOURNAMENT A ROCK 
HORSE FOR THE TOURNAMENT THANK YOU FOR COMING IN 
WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON HE HAD 
BEEN ASKING CIVIL WELL KNOWN 
PERSONALITIES WALKED SNOOKER MEANS 
TO HIM AND GARY LINEKER POSITS 
KEYS QUITE LOT 
SNOOKER WAS PART OF WORRIED GROWING 
UP I PLAYED LOT FROM THE AGE OF 
FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN I WOULD IN THE MORNING AND 
THAT BALL WAS KICKED A LOT OF 
BEATING 
HE WAS A DECENT CLUB PLAYER I ANY 
QUITE A LOT OF ONE HUNDRED BREAKS USED 
TO PLAY WITH WILLIE THORNE UNTIL 
HE 
GO FOR 
AN HOUR AND EVEN BOLDER 
I LOVE THE OLD CHAMPIONSHIPS WHEN 
IT GETS TOWARDS THE LATTER STAGES 
THAT'S THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
IT WITH IT OPEN TO GO TO BARCELONA 
AND THERE WAS NOWHERE TO PLAY 
THERE WAS ONE SNOOKER TABLE AND 
BAR BUT PEOPLE WOULD SIT AND FLICK 
ASH IN 
THE POCKETS L. GOT OUT OF THE HABIT OF PLAYING BEEN SOME THEN 
I JUST WATCH IT OR T. V. NEVER DRINK 
AND PLAY SNOOKER IT CAN BE VERY 
EXPENSIVE 
HIGHLIGHT WATCHING EXPENSIVE RONNIE WAS WILL THEN RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN YOU NEVER KNOW QUITE 
WHAT TO EXPECT WHICH ADDS TO IT 
HE CAN NEVER BE SURE WHICH RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN WILL TOM UP 
THAT IS HARSH ISN'T IT JOHN 
PARROTT HE USED TO COME TO WILLIE 
THORNE POSES CLUB AND HE WAS THE 
OTHER CAPTAIN ON THE PINK IT'S ALL 
OVER BUT THEY ARE BOTH GREAT 
SEE HIM AS EVERYONE ELSE DENNIS 
TAYLOR UNFORGETTABLE IT WAS IN 
THE EITHER WHEN I USED TO PLAY AND 
WATCH ALL THE TIME MOST PEOPLE 
WANTED MINUTES TO WIN HE WAS SUCH 
A LIKEABLE BLOKE AND STEVE HAD WON 
IT SO MANY THINGS IT WAS 
ENTHRALLING GRIPPING DRAMA 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIREBOMB WHAT IT 
TAKES TO BECOME MULTIPLE LORD 
CHAMPION TWO FIREBOMB FATHOM 
STEPHEN HINDLEY HAS WON THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP SO AND THINGS WHAT 
MAKES IT MUCH UP IN PERHAPS THERE 
WAS A BIT AFFORD JUST CAN HELP 
PRESIDENT GRAPHOLOGIST THIS THIS PICTURE IS MASSIVE STYLISED AND 
ELEGANT IT SHOWS VERY STRONG UP 
TOWARDS THE LEFT 
IT IS ALMOST AS THOUGH THIS PERSON 
SAYS MY BEGINNINGS HAVE MADE ME 
WHAT I AM MY FAMILY UNDER THEM WHO 
I AM UNDERPIN IT IS A POWERFUL 
THING AND 
THE LITTLE WHY AT 
BETWEEN STICKS 
RIGHT UP IN THE YEAR 
IT IS A PLEASANT ENOUGH SIGNATURE 
THERE ARE LOTS AND HIS EMOTIONS 
HERE BUT THERE IS UNPLEASANT 
DOMINANCE SHOWN I WILL DO IT MY 
WAY AND THAT IS WHAT COMES ACROSS 
LOOKING AT THE ACTUAL WRITING IT 
IS VERY MOBILE IT HAS 
GOT A 
BY THE 
MOVEMENT ABOUT IT FIERY MOVEMENT 
THIS IS A MAN WHO DOES HIS OWN 
THING HE CAN HE WAS SET THE ONE 
FRIENDLY BUT LOOKING BE ON BUT 
HE'S WELL ON HIMSELF 
HE IS 
A BIT 
OF A MAVERICK THAT IS PROBABLY 
WHAT MAKES HIM SUCH 
A SUCCESSFUL 
PERSON HE HAS GOT THE INITIATIVE 
AND CREATIVITY AND INDEPENDENCE AND 
INDIVIDUALITY TO BE WHO HE WANTS TO 
BE 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS LOST TO DING BE JUNE BE 
IN THIS MATCH 
OF THE FIVE 
PREVIOUS MATCHES THEM CHINESE PLAYER HE IS VIEWED AS 
A WAR 
HAS BEEN OUTPLAYED IN THIS MATCH SO 
FAR BUT THERE HAS BEEN A SPARK OF 
RESISTANCE WHICH HAS IGNITED AND 
MINI REVIVAL PROMPTING JUNE BE 
FROM DING JUNHUI 
GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

SENSATIONAL SNOOKER THIS WEEK TWO

QUARTER FINALS STEPHEN HENDRY 
IN JUNE BE WHEN HE WAS TEN TWO 
BEHIND LOOKED LIKE HE WAS GOING TO 
GIVE UP BUT HE HUNG ON IN THERE 
HE WAS UNLUCKY NOT TO BEAT IN SIX 
YOU ALWAYS THINK IT HAS LONG IS 
YOUR OPPONENT 
NEEDS TWO 
DREAMS 
HAVE GOT GLIMMER OF HOPE YES YES AND ADDING 
JUNE HE 
IS 
ONE OF 
THOSE 
AND ADDING JUNE HE IS ONE OF THOSE PLAYERS WHO CANCELLED VERY QUICKLY 
BENJAMIN HE THEY DING JUNHUI 
STEPHEN HINDLEY WILL WANT TO GET 
THIS MUCH OVER WITH AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE STEPHEN HENDRY 
WHAT ABOUT THAT FOR A SHORT LOOK 
AT THE RED HE 
WAS ON THAT 
BEST SHORT OF THE MATCH SO FAR IT 
WAS TYPICAL WE KNEW ARE FULLY 
COMMITTED TO SHORT HE DID NOT 
HE IS JUST ABOUT ON THIS RED ABOVE 
THE BLACK HE WILL HAVE TO PUT SOME 
BACKSPIN ON IT TO AVOID THE 
CONTRACT WITH THE BLACK 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS LOOKED EERIE KEN 
HOM AND COMPOSED AROUND THE TABLE 
THE E. CAMERA AND POOREST VERY 
CALM AND COMPOSED HE HAD A GREAT 
MATCH AGAINST YOUR MARK ALLEN IN 
THE FIRST ROOM STEPHEN HENDRY WON 
THAT BEEN ING THE BEST MATCH WE 
HAVE HAD SO FAR IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
WE KEEP SAYING THAT THERE ARE FEW 
PLAYERS JUST ONE MATCH AWAY FROM 
RESTORING THE CONFIDENCE AND BACK 
VICTORY OVER MARK ALLEN CERTAINLY 
RESTORED STEPHEN HENDRY POSITS 
CONFIDENCE 
HE HAS POTTED A TERRIFIC AMOUNT TO 
OF LONG BALLS 
HE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE 
BRIDGE HAND LIKE THAT 
COMFORTABLE 
THIS LOW YOU DELIVER THE CUE FROM 
THOSE OPPOSITIONS THE BETTER 
THOSE AWKWARD POSITIONS HE HAS A 
LOVELY SMOOTH TO THE VERY 
DELIVERY THERE ARE STILL FOUR REDS AVAILABLE 
THIS IS A VERY IMPRESSIVE START TO 
THIS ISSUE AND SESSION 
HE HAS PLAYED ON THAT RED THAT I'M 
INJURED NEAR THE PINK SPOT THAT 
I MENTION MENTIONED HE IS 
ALREADY 
LOOKING TO SEE IF THE RED WAS 
AVAILABLE INTO THE LEFT MIDDLE 
HE MAY GO INTO THE PINK THOUGH HE 
HAS A CHOICE HE CAN ALWAYS GO INTO 
THEM ARE AS SOON AS HE GETS ANY 
SORT OF CHANCE 
THAT SECOND KISS IT IS O. K. IT LOOKS 
LOOKED AS IF HE WAS RUNNING UP 
THE TABLE BUT IT HAS WORKED OUT 
NICELY 
HE DID NOT SPLIT THE REDS BUT AT 
LEAST WHEN YOU GET ON ONE THERE IS 
THE CHANCE OF SPOTTING THEM THERE 
ARE STILL A FEW REDS HE CAN REACH 
THEIR THERE 
STEPHEN HENDRY STARTED THIS MATCH 
WITH BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED 
AND WHEN 
PEOPLE 
HE IS BACK DOING WHAT HE USED TO DO 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR STARTING MATCH WITH HIGH 
BREAK THAT NUMBER OF TIMES HE HAS 
DONE THAT 
HE IS NO REPORTS HE WAS 
THERE IS NO ANY PLAYER WHO DRAWS 
STEPHEN HENDRY AND PINKS HE'S GOING 
TO HAVE AN EASY GAME THERE IS FOR 
SURE BANKS THINKS IS VERY 
HARD FOR HIM TO DO WHAT 
HE DID 
IN 
THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN HE WAS WINNING MORE 
OR LESS EVERYTHING 
STILL THE SAME CUEING ACTION KEEPS 
HIS HEAD PERFECTLY STILL HE HAS 
DONE THAT SINCE HE WAS A LITTLE BOY 
REMEMBER 
PLAYING IN 
IN 
EXHIBITION MATCH IN SCOTLAND 
OF AGE THE CUEING 
HE WAS TWELVE YEARS OF AGE THE CUEING ACTION HAS 
JEAN IT'S 
LIKELY BUT 
IT 
IS STILL BASICALLY THE SAME HAS 
CHANGED SLIGHTLY HAS HE GONE FAR ENOUGH YES 
AND IN WELL ACTUALLY OVAL THOUGH 
THE THEME BUT ACTUALLY OLD THE 
FRAME VIRTUALLY OVER NOW 
HE LET THAT ONE SLIP THIS IS A 
TRICKY BLACK HE COULD POSSIBLY 
CANNON INTO THE TRIANGLE OF REDS 
THERE WAIT ALMOST TIGHTEN THE 
CUSHION TERRIFIC SHOT THE WHITE 
ALMOST TIGHT 
HE HAS MADE ONE HUNDRED TWELVE CENTURY BREAKS AT 
THE CRUCIBLE THAT IS QUITE 
INCREDIBLE ABSOLUTELY SUPERB 
SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN CENTURIES HE HAS MADE IN HIS 
CAREER 
A CHANCE TO BEAT THE HIGH BREAK 
HERE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO BY JOE PERRY THIS IS THE KEY SHOT IF HE CAN 
COME OFF 
THE SIDE 
CUSHION 
AND ONTO 
THE YELLOW 
OR OFF 
TWO 
CUSHIONS IT 
JUST DEPENDS ON THE ANGLE 
HE HAS GOT A KICK WHAT A TIME TO 
GET A BAD CONTACT HE WOULD HAVE 
BEATEN THE HIGHEST BREAK BUT WHAT 
A 
START FOR 
THE SEVEN TIMES WORLD 
CHAMPION 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
HE 
IS NOW 
CHAMPION STEPHEN HENDRY HE IS NOW JUST ONE AWAY FROM VICTORY 
THAT IS AN UNBELIEVABLE START AND 
THE TYPE OF THING HE HAS DONE 
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER WHAT ABOUT 
THE OPENING POT I'M ANCIENT THE 
TIMING NO 
OTHER SHOT 
WAS ON SO 
HE 
HAD TO FULLY COMMIT HE HAS JUST 
STROKED THAT IN AND IS PERFECTLY ON 
THE BLACK 
THE FACT THAT THAT RED 
WAS TIGHT 
ON THE 
CUSHION WAS 
HELPING IF 
IT WAS 
A WAY 
FROM THE 
CUSHION IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE 
CUSHION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT 
I AGREE BUT IT IS STILL DIFFICULT A FAIR SHOT 
SHOT OF THE MATCH 
NICE TO SEE HIM PLAY SO WELL WE 
HAVE NOT SEEN THAT ENOUGH TIMES OF 
LATE 
BUT THAT CONFIDENCE IS BACK LATE HE WAS THIRTY THREE TO ONE BEFORE THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
STARTED I 
BET THERE 
WAS A FEW 
SCOTS 
WHO HAD 
A FEW QUID 
ON THAT A VERY HAPPY STEPHEN HENDRY 
HE HOPES THIS WILL BE THE LAST 
FRAME OF THIS MATCH DING JUNHUI 
DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS PLAYING SO 
FAR HE BROKE OFF AND SAT DOWN 
FOR THE REST OF THE FRAME 
MAYBE HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH THAT NO 
THERE IS A RED TO THE MIDDLE POCKET 
BUT HE WILL HAVE TO SOMEHOW GET ON 
THE PINK 
NOT HARD ENOUGH HE TRIED TO LEAVE 
THE PINK FOR THE MIDDLE 
BUT NO REACTION THERE FROM STEPHEN 
HENDRY PERHAPS THAT IS BECAUSE HE 
IS PLAYING SO WELL AND IS IN FRONT 
BUT IT HAS BEEN NOTICEABLE WHEN HE 
MAKES ERRORS HE'S NOT PUNISHING 
HIMSELF HIS RUN OF MIND IS VERY 
GOOD IS FRAME OF MIND 
THERE IS ONE TO THE LEFT CORNER HE 
HAS GOT A LITTLE BIT OF ANGLE 
LET'S SEE IF HE CAN KNOCK ANOTHER 
LONG ONE IN 
IF HE STOPS IT DEAD HE WOULD BE ON 
THE PINK 
DIDN'T HIT IT TOO BAD BUT HE WILL 
BE DISAPPOINTED HE DID NOT GET IT HE HAS DONE THAT WELL 
AS DENNIS MENTIONED THE WAY HE 
FINISHED LAST NIGHT'S SESSION WAS 
VERY IMPRESSIVE 
A LITTLE UNFORTUNATE THERE IF HE 
HAD HIT THE PINK FULL BALL HE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN ON TWO REDS THAT WAS BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED THERE 
AFTER A FEW HICCUPS EARLY ON DING 
JUNHUI IS LOOKING QUITE GOOD DEAL 
QUITE GOOD NOW 
WHEN HE GETS THIS NEXT RED OUT OF 
THE WAY HE CAN CLEAR THE BLACK TO 
GO IN BOTH POCKET POCKETS 
NOT THE TALLEST OF PLAYERS BUT 
HE'S A VERY COMPACT PLAYER 
NOT A GREAT DEAL CAN GO WRONG WITH 
HIS CUE ACTION 
THEY DO PUT A TERRIFIC AMOUNT OF 
PRACTICE IN THESE CHINESE PLAYERS 
MOST OF IT DON'T AT THE ACADEMY 
HEARING SHEFFIELD MOST OF IT 
DONE FANTASTIC PLAYING CONDITIONS 
STILL A RED THAT WILL GO AT THE 
BACK OF THAT BUNCH OF FOUR THERE 
NOW HE'S GOING TO CLEAR THE ONE 
NEXT TO IT THIS IS A VERY GOOD 
EFFORT FROM DING JUNHUI HERE 
IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE A ONE HUNDRED BREAK 
NOW HE IS SAFE IN THE FRAME 
HE GOT A KICK THERE THAT HAS TAKEN 
THE PACE OUT OF THE CUE BALL THAT 
MIGHT HAVE SPOILED THE CENTURY 
BREAK THAT WAS A BIT UNLUCKY THIS 
IS A VERY DELICATE RED HE IS 
LOOKING AT 
IT DOESN'T GO IN BUT IT DOESN'T 
MATTER 
MY BEST PERFORMANCE WAS WINNING THE 
U. K. CHAMPIONSHIP RIGHT THROUGH THE 
TOURNAMENT FROM A FIRST ROUND 
MATCH TO THE FINAL IT WAS 
DIFFICULT BUT I REALLY REALLY 
ENJOYED IT 
FOR MY EARLIEST CHILDHOOD I LOVE 
TO WATCH RONNIE O'SULLIVAN PLAYING 
HE WAS MY IDOL HE ALWAYS SEEMED IN 
TOTAL CONTROL AT THE TABLE HE WAS 
VERY COMFORTABLE IN WHAT HE WAS 
DOING HE LOOKS SO RELAXED L. WOULD 
LOVE TO BE SO RELAXED AROUND THE 
SNOOKER TABLE 
HE IS A BIT SPECIAL ISN'T HE TO 
HAVE WON THREE RANKING TITLES SO 
EARLY IN HIS CAREER 
JUST THE LAST SEASON AND A HALF HE 
HASN'T QUITE REALLY PRODUCED HIS 
TOP FORM 
NOT A GREAT BREAK OFF SHOT HASN'T 
LEFT ANYTHING EASY THOUGH 
MIGHT B. ABLE TO TAKE THE RED ON 
AND FIND THE GAP BETWEEN THE REDS 
AND BLACKS BUT HE IS HAMPERED 
NEARLY POTTED IT THAT IS A PRETTY 
GOOD SHOT 
NEEDS TO SLOW DOWN A BIT HE HAS 
STILL LEFT STEPHEN HENDRY A LONG 
RED TO GO FOR 
ONCE AGAIN STRUCK IT QUITE WELL 
IT IS ONLY A FRACTION 
DING JUNHUI NEEDS TO WIN THIS MATCH 
TO GET A CHANCE OF GETTING INTO THE 
TOP EIGHT 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS FIRST YEAR 
IN THE TOP EIGHT PLAYERS 
YOU GET INTO ALL THE COMPETITIONS 
AUTOMATICALLY AND DO NOT PLAY ANY 
OF THE TOP SEEDS UNTIL THE LAST 
EIGHT 
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO EIGHT DEVELOP THE REDS AND THE BLACK HE 
COULD HAVE GONE INTO THE PINK BUT 
IF HE HIT THAT RED BAUBLE IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN BETTER FULL BALL 
YOU NEED KUDOS FOR THAT ONE AND 
GOOD CUEING GOOD EYES THAT WAS 
OKAY 
HE MADE A COMPLETE MESS OF HIS 
ATTEMPTED SAFETY THERE FAR TOO 
THIN 
HE HAS FINISHED A LITTLE BIT 
STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK THAT MEANS 
THE RED WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE 
THE ONE TO THE RIGHT OF THE CUE 
BALL BUT YOU MIGHT THEN HAVE TO GO 
UP FOR A BLUE BECAUSE I DON'T 
THINK HE WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD FOR 
THE BLACK 
THAT WAS ALL HE COULD DO I DON'T 
KNOW IF HE CAN CANNON THE OTHER RED 
IF HE ROLLS THIS IN IF HE DOES 
THAT HE COULD STAY ON THE BLACK 
IF NOT HE HAS TO GET THROUGH THE 
GAP 
IT CANNOT HOLD WITH THE CANNON HE 
WILL HAVE TO TRY AND GET THROUGH 
THE GAP 
HE'S A BIT CLOSE TO THE SIDE 
CUSHION LOOKS GOOD I THINK 
THE LEFT WITH THE 
THERE IS NOTHING THERE THAT HE CAN 
GO FOR OR PLAY A SAFETY FROM 
STEPHEN MAY HAVE TO SWERVE SLIGHTLY 
AROUND THE YELLOW AND CATCH THE 
RED THIN THAT IS ONE OPTION BUT 
NOT VERY PRETTY 
THAT JUST SHOWS YOU WHAT STEPHEN IS 
FACED WITH 
THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF ROOM FOR 
THAT THAT RED DID NOT LOOK AS IF 
THAT WOULD GO 
DID YOU EVER THINK GOING BACK TO 
THE EIGHTIES WHEN WE USED TO GO TO 
CHINA THAT YOU WOULD SEE FOUR 
CHINESE PLAYERS MARCO FU IS FROM 
HONG KONG BUT FOUR CHINESE PLAYERS 
AT THE CRUCIBLE 
YES IT HAS BEEN 
TALKED ABOUT FOR A FEW YEARS WITH 
THE DEVELOPMENT THEY ARE MAKING IN 
CHINA FIVE SIX YEARS AGO THEY 
PUT IT INTO THE SCHOOLS AS PART OF 
THE CURRICULUM NOW THE TRAINING 
HAS BEEN QUITE INTENSE FOR THE 
PLAYERS IF THEY HAVE GOT THE 
TALENT AT AS THAT YOUNG MAN HAS 
THEY WILL START PLAY IN THE AMATEUR 
GAME AND QUALIFY FOR THE 
PROFESSIONAL GAME MANY ARE SAYING 
THAT IT WILL BE A LOT MORE THAN 
FOUR IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS 
MCLOUGHLIN THERE WHO WON THAT RACE 
BETWEEN STEVE DAVIS AND HIS 
MANAGER L. CAN'T REMEMBER 
YOU AND ME WERE ON THE STOPWATCH 
DENNIS 
THAT IS UNLUCKY THE DOUBLE DENNIS KISS THERE AND DING JUNHUI KNOWS 
ONLY TOO WELL BUT STEPHEN HENDRY 
COULD GET HIMSELF ON TO THE BLACK 
THE PINK IS AVAILABLE BUT IT JUST 
DEPENDS ON THE ANGLE HE HAS HERE 
WHETHER HE CAN GET OUT 
IF HE PLAYS A DELICATE SCREW SHOT 
AND GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE CIRCLE 
HE HAS GOT A CHOICE OF BLACK OR 
PINK IT DEPENDS ON THE ANGLE HE 
MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT 
HASN'T HIT IT HARD ENOUGH COME BUT 
HE HAS STILL GOT THE PINK 
YOU LOSE A BIT OF THE TOUCH WHEN 
YOU PUT THAT EXTENSION ON IT IS 
HARD TO PLAY THOSE DEFT TOUCH SHOTS 
LOOK WHAT HE'S STRIKING THE CUE 
BALL TO TRY AND HOLD THE WHITE 
WIGHT UP 
HE HIT THAT TOO WELL SO MUCH SIDE 
ON IT 
A CANNON WILL STOP THE WHITE FROM 
READING BACK UP THE TABLE HERE 
THAT IS PERFECTLY PLAYED THIS IS 
LOOKING OMINOUS FOR THE YOUNG 
CHINESE PLAYER JUST A DELICATE 
CANNON NEEDED THERE 
IT WAS ALL LOST AT THE START OF THE 
SECOND SESSION WHEN HE LOST FOUR 
FRAMES IN A ROW 
AND HE WAS A LITTLE BIT UNLUCKY NOT 
TO WIN THREE FRAMES IN A ROW HE 
LOST ONE OF THEM WHEN HE MADE A 
BREAK OF SIXTY TWO IF IT HAD BEEN TEN TO SIX 
OVERNIGHT HE WAS BACK IN THE MATCH 
BUT IT WAS A LONG WAY TO COME FROM 
I THOUGHT HE HAD HIT THAT A LITTLE 
BIT TOO GENTLY BUT THE PINK GOES 
OF COURSE 
I SAID EARLIER THAT HE ALWAYS 
STARTS REALLY WELL 
HE HAS BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL AT 
CLINCHING MATCHES WITH HIGHER 
BREAKS AS WELL CAN HE DO IT HERE 
AS A MATTER OF FACT HE WAS GOOD AT 
THE START GOOD IN THE MIDDLE AND 
GOOD AT THE END 
IT WAS JUST WHEN 
HE WASN'T AT THE TABLE THAT HE WAS 
STRUGGLING 
APART FROM THE DING JUNHUI 
SUPPORTERS I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD 
FIND ANYONE WHO WOULD NOT BE 
PLEASED TO SEE STEPHEN HENDRY BACK 
IN SOME GOOD FORM 
NOW THIS IS THE KEY POSITIONAL SHOT 
IF HE KNOCKS THE BLACK IN 
MAY HAVE TO PLAY CANNON HERE JUST 
TO HOLD THE WHITE TOOK HIS EYE OFF 
THE BLACK THOUGH JUST OVER CUT IT 
COMMENTATOR'S CURSE AGAIN 
FINISHING OFF HERE WITH THE BIG 
BREAK 
EVERY CHANCE FOR HIM TO PULL THIS 
FRAME BACK 
IF HE POTS THE BLACK HE COULD BE 
IN ANY ONE OF THOSE THREE REDS 
NOT QUITE FAR ENOUGH BUT HE CAN 
STUN BETWEEN THE RED AND PINK 
THE PLOT SUCCESS RATE BOTH ON NINETY PER CENT 
POT SUCCESS RATE 
DING HAS UPPED HIS GAME DURING THE 
LAST SESSION 
A VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE HERE TO 
TRY AND KEEP HIMSELF IN THIS YEAR'S 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP JUST NEEDS THE BLUE 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAD A BREAK OF FORTY SEVEN 
AND THEN HE MISSED THAT BLACK OF 
THE SPOT SO IT IS NOT QUITE OVER 
YET THAT WAS A TERRIFIC CLEARANCE 
FROM DING JUNHUI HE PULLS ANOTHER 
ONE BACK IT IS TWELVE TO SEVEN 
I AM LEFT 
WITH ONLY ONE HALF OF THE PUNDITRY 
DOUBLE ACT BECAUSE STEVE DAVIS IS 
WAITING BACKSTAGE FOR THE INTERVIEW 
AT THE END OF THIS MATCH BUT WELL 
WILL THE END COME THE CHINESE 
PLAYER IS PUT IN EPIPHYTE 
HE IS 
PROBABLY KICKING HIMSELF THAT HE 
DIDN'T PUT MORE EFFORT INTO THE 
START OF THE MATCH HE HAS THE TO 
THE BALL ALL RIGHT BUT HE LOOKED A 
BIT SUBDUED IN THE OPENING SESSION 
NOTHING WRONG WITH THE WAY STEPHEN 
HENDRY IS CUEING WHEN HE GETS IN 
STEPHEN IS VERY NEARLY THERE IF HE 
U. P. S. HIS PERCENTAGES WITH THE LONG 
POTS HE KNOCKED A FANTASTIC ONE 
TODAY IF HE GETS IT UP A BIT MORE 
HE WILL BE EXCEEDINGLY DANGEROUS I I THINK EVERYBODY AT THIS POINT IS 
EXPECTING HIM TO CROSS THAT LINE 
THERE'S NOT A GREAT CHANCE THAT 
DING WILL COME BACK AND WIN THIS 
ONE WHEN HE 
HE WOULD HAVE TO 
EQUAL THE TOURNAMENT RECORD LAST 
YEAR IT USED TO BE MINE I WAS TWELVE 
UP AGAINST SOMEONE AND LOST IT WAS 
MATTHEW STEVENS AGAINST SHAUN 
MURPHY LAST YEAR ITS TWELVE TO SEVEN NOW BUT 
I THINK STEPHEN HENDRY SHOULD WRAP 
THE MATCH UP 
HE STARTED VERY WELL 
WITH THAT SECOND TEN OF THE MATCH 
HE SAID RIGHT AT THE START THAT IF 
STEPHEN HENDRY CAN GET ONE GOOD WIN 
UNDER HIS BELT AT THIS CHAMPIONSHIP 
HE FELT HE STILL COULD BE A 
CONTENDER DO YOU STAND BY THAT I I DO IT'S PURELY CONFERENCE WITH HIM 
HE IS CUEING BEAUTIFULLY AT THE 
MOMENT O. K. HE MISSED THE BLACK OF 
THE SPOT IN THE LAST GAME BUT WHEN 
YOU GET IN AMONGST THE BALLS HE 
LOOKS LIKE HE CAN DO ANYTHING THIS THIS IS FRAME TWENTY OF A POSSIBLE TWENTY FIVE BACK 
TO THE BOYS 
STEPHEN HENDRY LOOKED TO HAVE HIT 
THAT BREAK OFF A LITTLE TOO HARD 
ONE READ HAS COME OVER TO COVER 
ANOTHER ON THE RIGHT AND SIDE 
RED 
BOTH THESE PLAYERS ARE OF COURSE 
VERY GOOD WHEN IT COMES TO 
DISLODGING REDS AWAY FROM THE BLACK 
SPOT JUST THE RETAINING SAFETY FROM DING 
THERE IS A TENT TO HEAR FOR DING 
INTO THE RIGHT CORNER TEMPTER 
HERE 
WELL IT IS TO LONGISH POT THAT 
STEPHEN IS FACED WITH THIS WILL BE 
A TEST FOR STEPHEN HENDRY WITH HIS 
CUE ACTION HERE HE HAS TOO 
STRAIGHT FISH REDS INTO THE LEFT 
CORNER AND HE IS BIT RELUCTANT TO 
TAKE THEM ON STRAIGHTER FISH 
REDS HE IS TAKING THE ONE INTO THE 
RIGHT CORNER 
HE IS DROPPING ON THE GREEN SO THAT 
WILL DO NICELY L. DON'T BLAME HIM 
FOR THAT CHOICE TERRY BECAUSE THE 
TWO STRAIGHT RIDES HE COULD HAVE 
GOT ON THE PINK BUT THERE WAS LESS 
RISK WITH THIS ONE THE ONE HE TOOK 
ON STRAIGHT REDS 
YES AND 
BECAUSE OF THAT LESS PRESSURE 
I THINK THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM 
AROUND THE PINK SPOT 
I THINK HE HAS GOT HIMSELF ON A RED 
THERE THAT WILL DEFINITELY CLEAR 
THE PINK HE HAS A CHOICE OF REDS 
THIS FRAME WILL DECIDE WHETHER WE 
HAVE IN MID SESSION INTERVAL IF 
STEPHEN HENDRY WINS IT THE MATCH 
IS OVER A. P. MID SESSION INTERVAL 
IF DING CAN GET A CHANCE HE COULD 
TEAR IT INTO THE FINAL SESSION IT 
DID NOT LOOK ON WHEN HE WAS TEN TO TWO 
BEHIND TO BE HONEST BUT HE HAS 
STUCK IN THEIR WELL AND EVERY 
CREDIT TO THE YOUNG CHINESE PLAYER 
THESE PLAYERS ARE SO GOOD INTO THE 
CENTRE POCKETS NOW THEY ARE NOT 
TROUBLED WITH HAVE A POT THE PINK 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CORNERS 
WHETHER THEY POT THE PINK 
SO YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SAY IT 
TERRY THAT HE IS GOING TO FINISH 
WITH STAFF 
YOU CAN SAY HE PLAYS 
WITH STARBUCK PLAYS WITH STAR 
BECAUSE HE HAS BUT THE FINISH 
HASN'T HAPPENED YET WITH STYLE 
EVERY TIME WE SAY THIS IS A FRAME 
WINNING BALL THEY HAVE MISSED THEM 
SO WE STOP SAYING IT 
WE SAY ABOUT A LOT OF PLAYERS THAT 
THE TOUGHEST FRAME TO WIN IS THE 
ONE WHICH COULD SUE OVER THE LINE 
IN THE MATCH HOW MANY TIMES AS 
STEPHEN HENDRY DONE THAT IN HIS 
CAREER NO PROBLEM FOR HIM TO 
CLINCH MATCH 
IF STEVEN WEBB IF STEPHEN HENDRY 
GOES ON TO WIN THIS FRAME AND THE 
MATCH HE WILL DO WANT TO PLAY THE 
WELSHMAN RYAN DAY HE DID SO WELL 
TO BEAT JOHN HIGGINS AFTER BEING FOUR 
ZERO BEHIND 
YES THAT WAS SOME 
PERFORMANCE FROM RYAN DAY HE BEAT 
ONE SCOTTISH WORLD CHAMPION AND HE 
WILL HAVE TO CONTEND WITH ANOTHER 
ONE 
AS YOU TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY 
PEOPLE SAY WHAT HAPPENED TO 
STEPHEN HENDRY HE IS STILL PLAYING 
WELL AND STILL CAPABLE OF WINNING 
AN EIGHTH WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
JUST THIS RED AND HE WILL PLAY TO 
CANNON 
HIMSELF ON THE BLACK ALSO WELL HE 
HIT THE BLACK SO IT DOESN'T REALLY 
MATTER HE PUT UP BRAVE FIGHT 
DING BUT IT WAS JUST TOO BIG GAP TEN TO TWO WAS TOO FAR BEHIND 
TERRIFIC CUEING AGAIN FROM STEPHEN 
HENDRY 
WELL THAT SEVENTY SHOULD BE MORE THAN 
ENOUGH TO TAKE STEPHEN HENDRY 
THROUGH TO THE QUARTER FINAL 
BEING IS COMING TO THE TABLE BUT 
THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE DING IS 
COMING TO THE TABLE 
HE HAD TO GET ON THE BLACK THERE 
AT THE MOMENT HE NEEDS THIRTY FOUR 
SNOOKERS TO TIE 
HE NEEDS THREE FOUR SNOOKERS TO 
TIE 
STEPHEN HENDRY'S FIRST PRIORITY 
HERE WOULD BE TO HIT THE RED BUT 
YOU MUST BE CAREFUL HE MAY PLAY IT 
OF TWO CUSHIONS BUT CHOKE SLOWLY 
YES THAT IS THE LINE HE COULD TAKE 
BECAUSE HE CANNOT GET DIRECTOR WHIT 
HE WOULD HIT THE YELLOW HE WOULD 
HAVE TO BE VERY PRECISE HE IS GOING OFF THREE CUSHIONS FAR OFF FOUL HE HAS STILL GOT A LOT TO DO 
YOU CANNOT BLAME THE YOUNG PLAYER 
FOR TRYING FOR THOSE SNOOKERS 
HE CAN GET THEM HE NEEDS A LITTLE 
BIT OF SIDE ON THIS NO IT WAS 
DIFFICULT AT THAT PACE 
STEPHEN HENDRY WILL BE VERY VERY 
PLEASED WITH HIMSELF 
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTING A VERY 
HARD MATCH WITH DING HE HASN'T 
REALLY HAD THAT 
STEPHEN HENDRY MADE THE MOST OF THE 
CHANCES HE HAD AND PUT THE PRESSURE 
ON 
IS THAT RED GOING TO BOUNCE OF THIS 
BACK CUSHION THIS COULD BE THE END 
AND IT IS THERE AND DING JUNHUI 
COMES FORWARD WITH A BIG SMILE HE 
CONGRATULATES THE SEVEN TIMES 
FORMER CHAMPION STEPHEN HENDRY 
WHO HAD TWO CENTURY BREAKS AND HE 
GOES THROUGH TO THE QUARTER FINAL 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS 
A COMFORTABLE THIRTEEN TO SEVEN WINNER 
SEVENTEENTH TIME IN THE QUARTER FINALS IT 
GOES WITHOUT SAYING HE HAS BROKEN 
HIS OWN RECORD HE KEEPS DOING THIS 
BUT BUT THE FIRST TIME FOR THREE 
YEARS GOOD TO SEE HIM BACK HOW 
WELL IS HE PERFORMING 
EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT TO NINETY FIVE PER CENT 
I THINK THERE IS MORE THERE AS HIS 
CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN GROWING HE HAS 
GONE AND BEAT DING JUNHUI ONE OF 
THE FAVOURITE HE HAS TO BE FULL OF 
CONFIDENCE NOW 
I THINK DING JUNHUI 
WAS THE FAVOURITE TO WIN THAT MATCH 
THAT'S A REAL TURN AROUND 
WE KEEP 
FORGETTING DING IS ONLY TWENTY ONE HE HAS 
COME ONTO THE SCENE ONE OF THREE 
RANKING EVENTS AND YOU WOULD EXPECT 
HIM TO PRESS ON HERE AND DO REALLY 
WELL HE HASN'T QUITE MANAGED TO DO 
THAT YET HE HAS HAD THE EXPERIENCE 
AND THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS YOU 
WILL SEE AN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS BEEN COMING HERE 
FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS ON THE TROT LET'S GET 
HIS REACTION 
STEPHEN YOU'RE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE 
IN THE FIRST ROUND MATCH THAT 
PERFORMANCE WAS FAR MORE IMPRESSIVE 
YEAH I WAS PRETTY SOLID THROUGHOUT 
THE WHOLE MATCH L. KNEW 
I HAD TO BE I DIDN'T TAKE ANY CHANCES L. KNEW 
THAT IF I MADE LOTS OF WARM FORCED 
ERRORS DING WOULD POUNCE ON THEM 
UNFORCED ERRORS L. MANAGED TO GET 
A BIG LEAD L. HATE HAVING BIG 
LEAGUES IT IS GREAT GETTING THEM 
BUT YOU SPEND THE NIGHT THINKING 
HE CAN ONLY LOSE THE MATCH IT IS 
HORRIBLE I WENT OUT THIS MORNING 
AND MADE A GREAT BREAK IN THE FIRST 
FRAME AND THEN IT STARTS TO GET A 
LITTLE BIT EDGY BUT I GOT OVER THE 
LINE 
DING WAS TWO TO ONE ON FAVOURITE FOR LINE THE MATCH YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT 
THAT WAS STRANGE JOBS AFTER THE WAY 
YOU FELT WITH A PERFORMANCE HE HE MUST HAVE BEEN BANGING DOORS DING 
IS ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS IN THE 
WORLD I HAVE DONE NOTHING TO BE 
FAVOURITE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF 
YEARS I THINK THEY WERE THE RIGHT 
ONES I KNOW THAT IF I CAN PERFORM 
HERE IT IS LIKE MY KITCHEN I LOVE 
IT OUT THERE 
YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING 
WITH CHRIS HENDRY THIS YEAR IT HAS 
NOT GELLED AS YET BUT ALL THE 
SUDDEN THERE ARE SOME SIGNS THAT 
THINGS ARE GOING RIGHT ANY 
CHANGES 
IF YOU TECHNICAL THINGS CHANGES AND A FEW MENTAL THINGS IF YOU 
KNOW ME YOU KNOW YOU NEEDED I 
NEEDED TO DO THEM BUT NOTHING 
MAJOR JUST LITTLE THINGS L. FELT 
PRETTY GOOD AND LAST NIGHT I 
THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO SCORE REALLY 
HEAVILY APART FROM A COUPLE OF 
SPIRITS BUT DID NOT GO MY WAY I 
COULD HAVE SCORED HEAVILY WHILST WHILST YOU ARE IN THE TOURNAMENT THE 
OTHER PLAYERS HAVE HAD A HEADACHE 
HAVE THEY GOT BIGGER NOW THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER THING IS TO SAY IN THE HEAT 
OF THE BATTLE YES AS LONG AS I'M 
IN IT THE PLAYERS KNOW WHAT I'VE 
DONE HERE THAT'S ALL 
A COUPLE OF 
DAYS BEFORE YOUR NEXT MATCH WHAT 
WOULD YOU BE DOING 
JUST RELAXING 
TRYING TO AVOID MARK WILLIAMS GOOD GOOD LUCK FOR THE REST OF THE TOURNAMENT 
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT 
THE MARK 
WILLIAMS IS LARGER THAN LIFE AND 
HE PLAYS TONIGHT AGAINST RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HE HAS BEEN WORKING 
WITH CHRIS HENDRY AND HE HAS SPOKEN 
ABOUT THE MENTAL TWEAKS 
I DON'T 
KNOW WHAT THEY ARE BARRED FROM 
TALKING TO STEPHEN QUITE A BIT A 
THINK HE FOUND HE WAS PROBABLY 
MOANING A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH IN 
THE INTERVALS AND BEING A BIT DOWN 
ON HIMSELF L. THINK IT MAY BE ALONG 
THOSE LINES L. DON'T KNOW FOR ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
A THING HE SAYS HE WAS MOANING A 
LITTLE TOO MUCH I THINK AND I 
KNOW I WAS MERSEYSIDE MOANING 
CHAMPION BUT THEN YOU THINK WHAT 
AM I DOING HERE LET'S GET ON WITH 
IT 
BUT EXPECTATIONS AND HE HAS IT WON IT SEVEN TIMES IT MUST BE HARD 
TO BE GOOD TO YOURSELF WHEN YOU 
KNOW YOU HAVE DONE BETTER IN THE 
PAST HARD TO LIVE UP TO YOUR OWN 
EXPECTATIONS 
VERY VERY EXPECTATIONS FRUSTRATING YOU'VE BEEN THERE 
DONE IT YOU GOT THERE ARE SEVEN 
TITLES AND THE THING FOR STEPHEN IS 
HE HAS BEEN PRACTISING 
FANTASTICALLY WELL HE KNOWS HIS 
GAME IS THERE THAT HAS NOT BEEN 
PRODUCING IT ON A MATCH DAY THERE 
IS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL 
BECAUSE HE HAS TO GO BACK JUST 
UNDER HIS BELT 
I KNOW JOHN FANCIES 
HIMSELF AS A BIT OF A COACH HIMSELF 
AND HE PROVED HIMSELF LAST WEEK 
BECAUSE HE WAS DOWN AT SHEFFIELD 
TRAIN STATION AT SHAUN MURPHY TO 
GIVE SOME TIPS TO SHEFFIELD 
COMMUTERS 
HELLO WHAT IS YOUR NAME CHRIS CHRIS CITY CENTRE AMBASSADOR WHAT IS 
THAT 
LIKE A COMMUNITY WARDEN THAT SCHEME IT IS ALL YEAR ROUND 
WILLIE BE TELLING US TO MOVE ON 
YOU ARE ON BREAK AT THE MINUTE 
WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION 
WHEN USING 
THE REST HOW DO YOU GENERATE A LOT 
OF BACKSPIN 
OFF YOU GO MAESTRO 
WELL THE BIGGEST MISTAKE PEOPLE 
MAKE WITH THE REST IS MAKING IT TOO 
COMPLICATED IT IS LIKE PLAYING A 
NORMAL SCREW SHOT PUT YOUR LEFT 
HAND IS HOLDING OF THE LEFT THE 
REST BY YOU'RE LEFT HANDED AND 
RIGHT HANDED RIGHT HANDED TIPPETT RIGHT HANDED RIGHT HANDED TIPPETT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE KEEP IT AS 
SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE A FEW TECHNICAL THINGS WHEN YOU 
TAKE YOUR POSITION TRY AND KEEP 
YOUR ELBOW NICE AND TIDY NOT LIKE 
THAT NICE AND HIGH NOT LIKE 
THAT REALLY THE ONLY SHOT IN THE 
GAME WAY YOU HAVE A SHORT BACKSPIN 
AND A SHORT FOLLOW THROUGH THE THE BIGGEST FAULT IS AMATEURS DON'T 
GIVE THEMSELVES AND HAVE CUE OVER 
THE END YOU WILL SEE THEM WITHOUT 
MUCH CUE HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET 
TO COME BACK THE FIRST 
THING IT DOES HIS CAN OF THE REST 
GIVE YOURSELF A NICE DISTANCE OF 
CUE TRACK AND MIRRORED THE LENGTH 
OF YOUR OWN BRIDGE THAT MAKES IT 
EASIER TRY AND MIRROR IN NICE 
DISTANCE OF CUE AND GET SOME 
MOVEMENT IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT 
GETTING SOME MOVEMENT GO ON 
MAESTRO KNOCK IN 
I WILL TRY AND 
SCREW IT BACK FOR THE GREEN OR THE 
BLUE 
SEE A NICE DISTANCE A GOOD BLUE LENGTH OF CUE STRAIGHT THROUGH 
ABSOLUTELY MARVELLOUS DO YOU WANT 
TO HAVE A GO 
I HAVE A GO YES I 
WILL 
ARE YOU GOING TO LET HIM USE WILL YOUR CUE YES EVERYONE BRINGS THE REST HAD TO 
CLOSE YOU ALSO WANT TO TRY IT AND 
KEEP IT DON'T BE CUEING ACROSS 
THE REST NICE AND LOW THEY YOU 
ARE YOU GOT A SCREW BACK IT IS 
JUST PRACTISE SOME GETTING USED TO 
IT A BIT OF MOVEMENT PLENTY OF 
CUE OVER THE END OF THE REST AND 
KIPPERED SMITH HE WILL GET THE 
SCREW BACK

DOING IT WE TOOK THE MICKEY OUT OF 
EACH OTHER ALL THE WAY THROUGH WE WE LOOK TO SEE EVERYONE ELSE TAKING 
PART 
I WAS DELIGHTED IT DID NOT PART SEEM LIKE TWO MINUTES IT SEEMED 
LIKE THIRTY SECONDS 
BACK TO THE 
SERIOUS STUFF OVER ON TABLE TWO 
FEATURING THAT COMBUSTIBLE WAS 
REGION STEPHEN MAGUIRE WHO HAS 
ALREADY WON THE U. K. TITLE WAS 
REGION HE HAS WON TWO RANKING 
TITLES THIS SEASON HE IS A LINE TO 
THE PLAYER OF THE SEASON HERE IS 
HOW HE 
HAS 
DONE OVER 
THE YEARS AT 
THE CRUCIBLE 
HE GOT CLOSE TO LANDING THIS WORLD 
TITLE LAST YEAR WHEN HE LED JOHN 
HIGGINS FOURTEEN PEN IN THE SEMI FINAL 
ONLY TO SUFFER SHATTERING SEVENTEEN TO FIFTEEN 
DEFEAT HE IS PLAYING LAST YEAR'S 
PLAYER OF THE OF THE AUSTRALIAN 
FROM MELBOURNE FIRST WITH IT TO 
SHEFFIELD AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HE GOT INTO HIS 
STRIDE THE FOLLOWING YEAR BUT LOST 
OUT AGAINST RONNIE O'SULLIVAN LAST 
TIME IT IS THE BEST OF TWENTY FIVE FRAMES 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE TOOK THE OPENING 
FRAME THIS IS FRAME TWO WITH THE 
SCORE BEHIND THE SCOT 
THAT LITTLE POWER ON THE TABLE HE 
IS ANGRY WITH THAT ONE THAT 
LITTLE TAT ON THE TABLE 
HE WOULD LOVE TO PLAY THE CANNON 
INTO THE TWO REDS BUT HE DOES NOT 
HAVE THE ANGLE TO DO THAT IT IS 
TOUGH TO GUARANTEE GETTING ONTO A 
RED FROM THE BLACK ON ITS OWN 
HE IS PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO 
PLAY FOR THE LOOSE RED FIRST HE 
HAS TO GET A HALF BALL ANGLE ON THE 
BLACK THIS COULD BE A FLAME 
FRAME WEATHER OR FRAME LOSER 
FRAME WINNER 
ANOTHER ONE THAT WAS VERY CLOSE 
RAHUL DRAVID YOURS IT RATTLED 
THE JAWS WE HAVE SEEN A FEW LIKE 
THAT THIS IS GOOD CHANCE NOW TO CANNON 
HE WANTS TO GO INTO THE LEFT HAND 
SIDE OF THAT RED IF POSSIBLE TO 
DEVELOP IT AND FINISH WITH THE 
OTHER ONE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY 
PERFECT 
WHEN YOU PLAY THAT SHOT YOU HAVE 
TO PLAY IT A LITTLE BIT FOLEY 
BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE 
RESTING ON THE RED FIRMLY THE THE GREEN WILL COME INTO THIS NO DOUBT 
ABOUT THAT 
THIS IS THE SHOT PERHAPS NOW HE 
MIGHT WANT TO PLAY OFF THE BAULK 
CUSHION AND DEVELOP THE GREEN HE 
NEEDS THE GREEN FOR THE FRAME 
DON'T FORGET SO IT'S POSSIBLE 
PLAYED THAT BEAUTIFULLY 
HE WAS 
UNLUCKY THAT IS THE ONLY CASE 
WHERE HE HAS TO DO PLENTY WITH THE 
CUE BALL THE PINK AND GREEN ARE 
STILL IN THE WAY WHEN HE WINS ROUND 
TWO CUSHIONS NOW RUNS ROUND 
HAS HE MISSED THE PINK AND THE 
GREEN HE HAS MISSED THEM BOTH BUT 
HE WANTED ANOTHER FOOT OFF PACE 
OF PACE 
THE GREEN MUST BE QUITE 
STRAIGHT HE DID NOT GO FOR WORK 
IT WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF BEING 
STRAIGHT SO THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE 
SHORT FOR THE GREEN SO HE HAS 
PLAYED IT SAFE 
THERE IS NO POINT IN TAKING ON THE 
YELLOW BECAUSE HE NEEDS TO STAY AT 
THIS END OF THE TABLE FOR THE GREEN 
IT IS A BIG BALL THIS YEAR WILL 
YELLOW THAT IS A REAL BAD SHOT HE 
IS ONE OF THE GAME'S BEST POTTERS 
AND BREAK BUILDERS HE HAS TO 
IMPROVE IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS 
IT IS GREEN BROWN AND BLUE HE IS 
A BIT STRAIGHT ON THIS NEEDS A 
SLIGHT ANGLE HE WAS THE WRONG SIDE 
OF STRAIGHT BUT THERE IS NO 
PROBLEM BECAUSE HE CONTROLLED IT 
NICELY 
IN THE FIRST FRAME STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
THE DESERVED WINNER IN THIS FRAME 
NEIL ROBERTSON WILL BE VERY 
DISAPPOINTED HE HAS HAD CHANCES TO 
WIN THIS FRAME 
ONE TO THREE FAVOURITE STEPHEN MAGUIRE IN 
THIS MATCH WHICH IS JUST ABOUT 
RIGHT I WOULD SUGGEST 
WILL NEIL ROBERTSON COME BACK TO 
THE TABLE ROBERTSON HAD HIS CHANCE 
BUT STEPHEN MAGUIRE GOES CLEAR BY 
TWO TO ZERO 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE WON THE MOST RECENT 
TOURNAMENT IN CHINA THE LAST ONE 
PLAYED BEFORE COMING YEAR TO 
SHEFFIELD A VERY POSITIVE START TO 
THIS MATCH FOR HIM IN FRAME THREE 
ROBERTSON HAS JUST GONE IN OFF 
THAT WAS WORTH ANOTHER LOOK 
TERRIFIC THOSE ARE THE SHOT THAT 
MAKE YOU FEEL GREAT ABOUT YOUR GAME 
YOU GET 
ONE OF 
THOSE I'M YOU FEEL 
TEN FOOT TALL AND YOU FEEL 
I JUST WONDER WHERE THE BLACK WILL 
GO MICHAELA TABB SIZING IT UP L. 
THINK IT IS ACTUALLY ON ITS SPOT 
THIS CHANCE CREATED BY THAT 
TERRIFIC OPENING RED 
HE HAD A GOOD CHANCE OF A MAXIMUM 
EARLIER IN THE WEEK WHEN HE GOT TO 
THE FIFTEENTH RED HE WAS DISAPPOINTED 
THAT HE POTTED FOURTEEN REDS AND BLACKS 
AND WEST THE RED IT IS A CASE OF 
FINISHING LOW ON THIS BLACK AND 
PUSHING THOSE TWO REDS AWAY FROM 
THE BLACK 
THIS IS THE KEY SHOT NO PROBLEM 
GETTING ON A RED THE PROBLEM IS 
GETTING ON RED TO GET AN ANGLE TO 
THE BLACK HE WANTS TO MOVE THOSE 
TWO REDS AWAY FROM THE BLACK SPOT 
SEE WHAT I MEAN ABOUT TOTAL 
CONTROL HE IS NOW GOING AWAY FROM 
THE BLACK THAT IS THE END OF HIS 
THOUGHTS FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN I THINK 
HE HAS GONE TOO FAR BY QUITE A LONG 
WAY 
ONE OF THE GAME'S REALLY HIGH BREAK 
BUILDERS STEPHEN MAGUIRE HE HAS 
THE TWENTY SIX CENTURIES THIS SEASON HE 
KNOWS HIS WAY AROUND THE BLACK SPOT 
PERIOD HE PRACTISED WITH THE 
LEGEND THAT IS STEPHEN HENDRY IN 
THE EARLY PART OF HIS CAREER 
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BECOME BETTER 
IT IS O. K. PLAYING ON YOUR OWN BUT 
IF YOU GET 
CHANCE TO 
PLAY WITH A 
GREAT PLAYER SOMEONE WHO KNOWS 
WHAT 
THEY ARE 
DOING WITH THE CUE 
BALL SOMEONE WHO BREAK BUILDS 
THAT OF THEIR CHOICE THERE HE WAS 
NOT HAPPY WITH THAT BIT OF PETULANCE THERE 
THE TOP PLAYERS THE BREAK BUILDING 
IS THE KEY TO THE GAME KNOWING 
WHEN TO GO INTO THEM KNOWING WHEN 
NOT TO STEPHEN MAGUIRE KNOWS HIS 
WAY AROUND THAT 
YOU CAN SEE HIS ANNOYANCE THAT HE 
MISSED THAT WAS A CHANCE THAT YOU 
WOULD HAVE BET BOARD'S OWN THAT 
HE WOULD WIN THE FRAME THERE IS 
HIS REACTION HE IS FUMING ODDS 
ON HE IS ONE OF THESE GUYS WHO 
SETS HIMSELF HIGH STANDARDS HE IS 
VERY ANGRY WHEN HE MISSES 
HE DOES 
NOT MEAN ANY HARM HE IS A VERY 
LIKEABLE YOUNG MAN HE HAS GOT SO 
MUCH PRIDE IN HIS PERFORMANCE THIS 
IS A TOUGH GAME YOU CANNOT KNOCK 
EVERYTHING IN IT IS TOUGH FOR NEW 
ROBERTSON TO BUILD A FIFTY ODD BREAK 
HERE WITH THE WAY THE BALLS ARE HE 
HAS NOT BEEN OUTPLAYED HE HAS JUST 
BEEN OUT SCOLD OUTSCORED 
THE FACT THAT NEIL ROBERTSON IS 
LEFT HANDED THOSE FIVE REDS ARE 
NOT IN HIS FAVOUR HE WOULD LIKE PUT 
THEM ON THE OTHER 
SIDE 
HE COULD PLAY ON THEM THEN HE 
CANNOT PLAY ON THEM NOW WITHOUT 
USING THE REST THE WORK STARTS NOW 
HE HAS ASKED FOR THE CUE BALL TO BE 
CLEANED L. THINK HE TRIED TO SCREW 
IN BEHIND THE TWO REDS THAT 
SOUNDED VERY YOU DO NOT GET KICKS 
SO MUCH ON SCREW SHOTS BUT HE WAS 
VERY SHOCKED AND THE RED TO THE 
CENTRE IS VERY NARROW ANGLE VERY SHORT 
THAT WAS A FABULOUS RECOVERY AND 
THE HORRIBLE SHOT TO PLAY HE WOULD 
LIKE TO PLAY 
A 
SIMILAR SHOT TRYING 
TO GET IN THE GAP BETWEEN THOSE TWO 
REDS IF HE 
PLAYS THE 
SCREW SHOT HE 
WILL BE TRYING TO MOVE A RED OUT 
HE CAN 
JUST FORCED 
IT ACROSS TO 
THOSE REDS O'DEA NO MATTER HOW 
GOOD OR BAD YOU ARE YOU CANNOT 
MISS THOSE OH DEAR THE MATCH 
HAS FINISHED ON THE OTHER TABLE AND 
THEY HAVE GOT THE THEATRE TO 
THEMSELVES THIS IS THE ARENA OF 
DREAMS WHEN THIS HAPPENS 
YOU FEEL THAT NEIL ROBERTSON HAS 
NOT QUITE GOT GOING YET TO BE HE 
HAS 
LOST A 
COUPLE OF FRAMES FRAME 
TWO HE SHOULD HAVE WON YOU CANNOT 
GO THREE TO FOUR NIL DOWN AGAINST SOMEONE OF 
THE STATURE OF STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
THAT'S IT TERRIFIC SHOT HE IS NOW 
ON THE BLACK AND THAT'S A 
TERRIFIC SHOT A GOOD IDEA AS WELL 
BECAUSE HE CAN ONLY LEAVE THE RED 
HE PLAYED AM NOT SURE WHERE THE 
NEXT RED IS GOING TO COME FROM 
MIND YOU IT IS A NON STARTER TO 
CONTINUE THE BREAK AFTER THE SPLAT 
HE COULD PLAY THE SCREW SHOT POT 
THE BLACK GO OFF THE BALL CUSHION 
AND COME DOWN TO CANNONED THE REDS 
GETTING FAIR CASE IS EVEN HARDER GETTING THE KISS 
THE REDS WILL BE EASILY BROUGHT 
INTO PLAY AT SOME TIME L. DIDN'T MIND THAT SHOT 
WHAT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS 
THAT PLENTY OF BALLS ARE STAYING 
OVER POCKETS AT THESE TABLES THERE 
HAS BEEN TALK ABOUT THE BOUNCY 
CUSHIONS WHICH MEANS THE JAWS OF 
THE POCKETS ARE ALSO A LITTLE BIT 
SHARP ANYTHING THAT IS NOT QUITE 
IN IS NOT GOING IN OFF THE LIP OF 
THE POCKET 
OH MY WORD HE HAS MISSED THAT BY 
A MILE HE HAS MISSED THAT BY SO 
FAR IT IS UNTRUE THE FRAME IS GONE 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE HAS PULLED INTO A 
THREE TO ZERO NEIL LEAD OVER NEIL ROBERTSON 
I THINK I AM QUITE A HEAVY SCORER 
SO WHEN I GET ON I TRY TO STAY ON 
THE TABLE AND CLEAR ALL THE BALLS 
IN ONE VISIT IF I'M PLAYING WELL 
I AM USUALLY QUITE GOOD AT THAT 
TEMPERED TEMPERAMENT LETS ME DOWN 
A LOT SOMETIMES I CAN KEEP IN BUT 
OTHER TIMES I'LL ADMIT I LOSE THE 
PLOT IT HAS COST ME A LOT OF 
MATCHES OVER THE YEARS DON'T 
KNOW HOW YOU WORK ON IT SOMETIMES 
L. FEEL BETTER THAN 
I DO L. STABBED 
A CURE OR GIVE THE TABLE WHACK 
AND IT IS OUT OF MY MIND THEN I 
CAN CONCENTRATE ON THE GAME L. 
DON'T KNOW IT IS IF IT IS BETTER 
FOR ME TO LET IT OUT IT DOESN'T 
LOOK GOOD I KNOW THAT BUT IF IT 
HELPS ME PLAY BETTER IT HELPS ME 
WHEN A BATCH MATCH I WILL DO IT 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE TOP SPIN SHOT 
NEIL HAS GOT THE POWER TO PLAY THAT 
SHOT TERRIFIC CUE POWER L. L. THINK THAT IS WHAT HE IS LOOKING AT 
HE HAS MISSED THE POT OH DEAR OH 
DEAR IT HAS GONE FROM BAD TO WORSE 
MISSING THE PLOT WAS ONE THING THE 
BLUE HAS CRASHED INTO THE REDS AND 
LOOK AT THE CUE BALL TRAVELLING 
LOOSE IT HAS FINISHED IN A PERFECT 
POSITION 
THIS IS ANOTHER CHANCE FOR A 
SIZABLE BREAK 
THE KEY THING IN THIS MATCH IS THAT 
PAUL HAS ALWAYS LEFT MAGUIRE EASY 
BALLS HIS SAFETY SUCCESS IS DOWN 
AT SEVENTY EIGHT PER CENT THE INTERESTING THING IS 
SO IS REQUIRES THAT IS NOT AS IF 
THEY ARE BEING OUTPLAYED BUT 
MAGUIRE IS MAKING MORE OF THEM MAGUIRE LOOKS MORE DANGEROUS IN 
AMONGST THE BALLS HIS POT SUCCESS 
IS VERY DECENT 
ROBERTSON IS DOWN TO EIGHTY PER CENT WHICH 
TELLS A STORY REALLY HE HAS 
MISSED A NUMBER OF BALLS 
CERTAINLY HE READ AND A HIGH 
COLOUR WILL BE ENOUGH I READ 
THE FACT HE HAS TAKEN THE BLUE 
WOULD MEAN HE COULD TIE THE FRAME 
THAT WOULD DEPEND IF THE BREAK ENDS 
AFTER THIS BLUE THIS IS FRAME BALL 
FOUR TO ZERO IS THE BEST START POSSIBLE 
NEIL ROBERTSON WILL BE VERY 
DISAPPOINTED GREAT SHOT A POSSIBLE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE ON IF HE CLEARS UP 
JOE PERRY HOLDS THE HIGHEST BREAK 
AT THE MOMENT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO BUT THIS COULD 
BE A BIGGER TARGET MAGUIRE SEEMS 
TO BE PLAYING FAST AND FIVE FASTER 
AND FASTER NOW AT THIS LEVEL AND 
THE CRUCIBLE ONE HUNDRED FORTY PLUS IS THE ONLY 
CHANCE YOU HAVE OF WINNING THE TIE 
BREAK THE HIGH A BREAK THIS HAS 
ALL COME OFF THE A ROBINSON'S 
ESTATE HE MISSED THE BREAK BY A 
LONG WAY AND IT CRASHED INTO THE 
REDS AND MAGUIRE HAS DONE THE REST 
ONLY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE AVAILABLE NOW 
THIS IS THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIFTH CENTURY OF HIS 
CAREER A VERY SHORT CAREER THAT 
IS HOW GOOD THIS YOUNG MAN IS I'M 
SURE HE REALISES THE TARGET 
VERY WELL PLAYED STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE NEIL ROBERTSON WILL GO 
STRAIGHT TO THE PRACTICE TABLE HE 
HAS HAD PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES HE 
HASN'T TAKEN ANY STEPHEN THE MATCH 
HAS STEPHEN MAGUIRE HAS TAKEN 
THEM ALL AND LEADS THE MATCH 
WHAT A FIRST SESSION THAT WAS JOHN 
HAS MADE A PREDICTION 
I THINK HE 
IS GOING TO TAKE A HECK OF A LOT OF 
STOPPING IN THIS TOURNAMENT 
SOMEONE TO BEAT HIM IS GOING TO 
PLAY OUT THEIR BRAINS BECAUSE I 
THINK HE HAS THE EYE OF THE TIGER 
AT THE MINUTE HE HAS HAD A GREAT 
SEASON HE IS NOT WORRIED ABOUT 
ANYONE ELSE HE LOOKS FOCUSED WHAT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIS AGGRESSION 
LEVELS AT THE TABLE THEY THEY DETERMINED ALL THIS HAS BEEN WENT 
THROUGH A STICKY PATCH WHEN HE WAS 
PLAYING THAT GREAT STUFF A COUPLE 
OF YEARS BACK AND WON THE U. K. 
CHAMPIONSHIP IT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS 
HERE TO STAY NOW IT LOOKS LIKE SHE 
IS HERE TO STAY AGAIN BUT THERE 
ARE SOME GREAT PLAYERS LEFT IN THE 
TOURNAMENT HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO 
PLAY HIS WAY THROUGH IT THE BOTTOM 
HALF IS OPEN IT 
HE IS A CONFIDENT 
CHAP NEIL ROBERTSON HE IS NOT 
GOING TO BE AFRAID 
NO BUT HE IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY BETTER THAN 
HE IS AT THE MINUTE HE HASN'T BEEN 
THE SAME THIS YEAR AS LAST THE THE MAIN HEADLINE STORY IS THAT THE 
REIGNING CHAMPION HAS DEPARTED IT 
WAS BRIAN THE WORLD NO SIXTEEN WHO 
COMPLETED A THIRTEEN TO NINE AT VICTORY TO SEND 
THE DEFENDING CHAMPION HOME TO 
GLASGOW L. WONDER WHAT KIND OF THE 
SHOCKWAVES THAT WILL SEND TO THE 
TOURNAMENT 
OBVIOUSLY THE PLAYERS TOURNAMENT ARE LOOKING TO SEE IF THE BIG NAMES 
GO OUT BUT THERE ARE SO MANY BIG 
NAMES NOBODY WORRIES ABOUT THAT 
HIS ONLY WORLD CHAMPION IT'S 
NOTHING LIKE A BIG DEAL 
HE GOT TO 
PLAY A HUGE TRIBUTE TO RYAN DAY
