MUSICIAN JARVIS COCKER WHO IS

BRIGHTON FESTIVAL 
SMART PEOPLE IS THE DIRECTORIAL 
DEBUT FROM NOAM MURRO AND IS IN A 
SIMILAR MOULD TO INDIE FILMS LIKE 
THE SQUID AND THE WHALE WHICH TURN 
FAMILIES INSIDE OUT USING DARK 
HUMOUR TO EXPOSE THE FAULTS AND 
FAILINGS BEHIND THE FRONT DOOR AND 
OUTSIDE IT TOO TWO UNEXPECTED 
ARRIVALS CHANGE THE LIFE OF 
LAWRENCE WETHERHOLD A WIDOWED 
GROUCH AND ENGLISH LIT UNIVERSITY 
PROFESSOR PLAYED BY DENNIS QUAID 
THE FIRST IS CHUCK HIS WAYWARD 
ADOPTED BROTHER PLAYED BY THOMAS 
HADEN CHURCH WHO CAN SEE THE 
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE WETHERHOLD IS 
INFLICTING ON HIS TEENAGE CHILDREN 
IN PARTICULAR HIS PRECOCIOUSLY 
BRIGHT RIGHT WING DAUGHTER VANESSA 
PLAYED BY ELLEN PAGE THE SECOND IS 
FORMER STUDENT JANET NOW A DOCTOR 
SARAH JESSICA PARKER WHO TREATS

SO NICE OF YOU TO COME I AM DOCTOR 
HARTIGAN 
CALLED YOUR BROTHER AND HARTIGAN TELL HIM TO GET MY CAR OUT OF THE 
IMPOUND LOT AND HAVE IT HERE AT NINE A M. 
KNOW YOU DO THAT 
YOU CANNOT 
LEGALLY DRIVE FOR SIX MONTHS L. 
HAVE TO REPORT IT 
DON'T REPORTED 
I AM NOT BEING YOUR CHAUFFEUR FOR 
SIX MONTHS THESE TIMES ARE CRUCIAL 
YOUNG REPUBLICANS THE NATIONAL 
HONOUR SOCIETY 
I WILL HIRE A 
DRIVER ON MONDAY 
IF YOU NEED 
ANYTHING I AM HERE ALL NIGHT GO GO HOME AND GET SOME SLEEP AND YOU 
WILL GET THAT PERFECT S. A. T. SCORE 
IS THIS A SMART PICTURE 
I AM A 
PROFESSOR AND THIS GAVE PROFESSORS 
A BAD NAME IT IS ONE OF THOSE 
ARROGANT AMERICAN FILMS THAT 
ASSUMES WE ARE HAPPY TO SIT AND 
WATCH AMERICAN ACADEMICS THAT 
CHUNTERING IN DEEP VOICES THE MEN 
HAVE ALWAYS GOT DEEP VOICES AND 
THEY SPOUT TRIPE THEY SAY THE 
WORLD IS A CHAIR SUDDENLY SARAH 
JESSICA PARKER DRIFTS IN FROM 
DIAGNOSIS MURDER IT IS NOT AS GOOD 
AS THE SQUID AND THE WHALE WHICH 
IS A GREAT FILM THIS IS THE SQUID 
AND THE WHALE MADE WITH A MECCANO 
SET JARVIS L. THOUGHT IT WAS ALL SET JARVIS RIGHT IT HAS THAT BLOKE THE 
ADOPTED BROTHER HE IS ONE OF THOSE 
PEOPLE THAT CAN SAY SOMETHING AND 
HE HAS A FUNNY VOICE DO YOU KNOW 
WHAT I MEAN LIKED HIM HE HE DEFINITELY BROUGHT SOME SPIKE TO 
THE FILM 
HE HAS THE LIVELIEST 
THING IN IT L. AGREE THAT IT IS NOT 
ONLY A STUPID FILM BUT IT ASSUMES 
ITS AUDIENCE IS STUPID THAT IS 
WHAT I HAD TROUBLE WITH IT SPENDS 
ITS TIME TELLING US RATHER THAN 
SHOWING US WHAT IS GOING ON THERE 
IS THAT INFURIATING SOUNDTRACK THE 
ACOUSTIC GUITAR PLAYING OUT ALL OF 
THE EMOTION AND THEY HAVE TO SPEAK 
THEIR FEELINGS THEY SAY THINGS 
LIKE I HAVE NOT HAD ANY MAJOR 
EPIPHANIES IT IS LIKE THEY HAVE TO 
SPELL IT OUT 
YOU HAVE ELLEN PAGE 
WHO I THOUGHT WAS TERRIFIC AS THE 
YOUNG REPUBLICAN YOU HAVE THOMAS 
HAYDEN WHO IS A TERRIFIC ACTOR 
WHAT ABOUT DENNIS QUAID 
HE HAS A 
FANTASTIC FACE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT 
BOTH OF THE LEAD MEN HAVE FANTASTIC 
FACES YOU CAN SEE THEIR LIFE IN 
THE FACE TO ME IT WAS NOT A 
PERFORMANCE I AGREE HE IS TRYING 
TO PLAY IT DOWN AND MAKE IT LESS 
THAN IT SHOULD BE IT FELT LIKE THE 
SCENES DRIBBLED AWAY THEY WERE 
DOING THE THINGS YOU WOULD TELL 
PEOPLE NOT TO DO IN A WRITING 
WORKSHOP ABOUT WRITING FILMS I I THOUGHT ELLEN PAGE HAD THAT HEART 
KNOWINGNESS BUT IT WAS A LITTLE 
BIT OVER DONE TO HEART 
KNOWINGNESS HER CHARACTER HAS AN 
EXTRAORDINARILY HARD TO BELIEVE 
JOURNEY I FELT IT DID HER A 
DISSERVICE AS AN ACTOR KEEPING 
HER IN THAT SMART MOUTH TO BOX 
WHEN WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HER 
CHARACTER WAS ACTUALLY REALLY SAD 
I SUPPOSE THE IDEA WAS THAT SHE WAS 
SO HARD TO MASK THE FACT THAT HER 
MOTHER HAD DIED AND THE FATHER WAS 
ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THE CHILDREN 
WERE HOLDING IT TOGETHER WHICH IS 
NOT UNCOMMON 
AND THE SUN WAS GREAT 
BUT NONE OF THE ACTORS WERE 
PITCHING IT IN THE SAME WAY LET'S LET'S LOOK A BIT MORE AT THOMAS HADEN 
CHURCH AND THE GIRL WHO PLAYS 
VANESSA ELLEN PAGE HERE THEY ARE 
HAVING JUST SHARED A JOINT AND 
THEIR FATHER COMES IN 
WHERE DID 
YOU GET THAT 
IN THE CLOSET 
I TOLD 
HIM IT WAS WOMEN'S COLLEGE 
IT IS 
CAROLINE'S SWEAT SHIRT 
I TOLD HIM 
THAT TOO THAT IT WAS MUM'S SWITCH 
IT 
TAKE IT OFF DID IT EVER OCCUR IT TO YOU THAT I MIGHT BE SAVING THAT 
SWEAT SHIRT PLEASE DO NOT REPAY IT 
RIP IT 
AND THINK HE MAY HAVE SMELLED THE 
POT 
THERE ARE SOME PRETTY TIGHT POT SCENES LIKE THAT UNFORTUNATELY 
SARAH JESSICA PARKER IS NOT IN ANY 
OF THEM HER ROLE IS NOT VERY WELL 
DEVELOPED 
ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO SAY DEVELOPED IT IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE FOUND 
HER ATTRACTIVE 
THAT IS SOMETHING 
I NEVER WATCHED SEX IN THE CITY 
BECAUSE IT GOT ON MY NERVES SEX 
AND THE CITY BUT YEAH SHE IS NOT 
BAD LOOKING 
AT THE END OF THE 
SCENE THERE IS A BIT OF MUSIC TO 
SHOW YOU HOW TO FEEL SUDDENLY SUDDENLY THEY PRESS A BUTTON AND THERE IS 
ACOUSTIC GUITAR IT ASSUMES THAT 
THE AUDIENCE IS TOO DAFT TO WORK 
OUT WHERE IT IS GOING 
YOU KNOW 
WHERE IT IS GOING IT IS CALLED 
SMART PEOPLE SO YOU CAN BE 
INTELLIGENT BUT NOT EMOTIONALLY 
INTELLIGENT YOU KIND OF KNOW WHERE 
IT IS GOING TO GO IT IS NOT AN 
AMAZING FILM ON THE POSTER IT SAID 
FROM THE PRODUCERS OF SIDEWAYS 
WHICH IS A VERY TENUOUS CONNECTION 
WE GOT THE MONEY FROM THE SAME 
PLACE SO THE FILM WILL BE SIMILAR 
IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS THAT FILM 
DEFINITELY BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS O. K. 
IT WAS ALSO THE COMPOSING DEBUT OF 
THE COMPOSER WERE YOU CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE MUSIC 
HE IS THE BLOKE 
WITH A VERY LONG OVER CONDITIONED 
HAIR WHO WAS IN A GROUP CALLED 
EXTREME WHO HAD A HORRIBLE SONG 
CALLED MORE THAN WORDS COMPARED TO 
THAT THIS IS QUITE GOOD THE MUSIC 
IN THERE 
THERE IS A MARKET FOR 
THIS KIND OF FILM BECAUSE THE 
SQUID AND THE WHALE A WHOLE LOAD 
OF INDIE FILMS 
IT IS A BIT IN THE 
SUNDANCE MOULD L. SAT 
IN A CINEMA IN NORTH LONDON WHERE PEOPLE HAD 
PAID TO SEE IT WHY CAN'T WE MAKE A 
FILM ABOUT STAFFORDSHIRE UNIVERSITY 
YOU JUST WANT TO BE IN IT THERE THERE WAS THE HISTORY MAN ALL THOSE YEARS 
AGO 
WE 
COULD NOT DO IT BECAUSE WE AGO COULD NOT DO 
THOSE UTTERANCES IN THOSE DEEP DARK VOICES 
PRONOUNCING YOUR FEELINGS ALL THE 
TIME TIME SMART PEOPLE CERTIFICATE FIFTEEN IS ON 
GENERAL RELEASE 
MARY WHITEHOUSE WAS FAMOUS FOR 
FOUR DECADES THE CHRISTIAN 
HOUSEWIFE AND ART TEACHER TOOK ON 
THE BROADCAST MEDIA IN PARTICULAR 
THE B. B. C. IN HER CRUSADE AGAINST THE 
FILTH SHE SAW ON T. V. SHE WAS THE 
FOUNDER AND FIRST SELF STYLED 
PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL VIEWERS' 
AND LISTENERS' ASSOCIATION AND THE 
THEATRE WAS ALSO SUBJECT TO HER 
SCRUTINY WHITEHOUSE DIED IN TWO THOUSAND ONE 
AND A NEW B. B. C. TWO DRAMA FILTH 
GOES BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AND THE BEGINNING 
OF HER CAMPAIGN TO CLEAN UP T. V. 
WHEN SHE WAS ENRAGED BY A B. B. C. 
PROGRAMME WHICH EXPLORED PRE 
MARITAL SEX AS FAR AS SHE WAS 
CONCERNED IT WAS DOWNHILL FROM THEN 
ON WITH A CASCADE OF SEX VIOLENCE 
AND SWEARING ONE OF HER MOST 
FEROCIOUS BATTLES WAS WITH THE B. B. C. 
DIRECTOR GENERAL SIR HUGH CARLTON 
GREENE IN FILTH GREENE IS PLAYED 
BY HUGH BONNEVILLE WHILE JULIE 
WALTERS DONS THE WING TIP GLASSES 
AND A TIGHT PERM TO PLAY MARY 
WE MEMBERS OF THE LOWER SIXTH WERE 
VERY DISTURBED BY THE RECENT 
BROADCAST OF A RADIO PLAY WRITTEN 
BY DAVID TURNER 
LET ME SPEAK IT IT WAS A VERY DISTRESSING PORTRAYAL OF 
THE MIND OF YOUNG MAN OBSESSED 
WITH SEXUAL THOUGHTS AND IN OUR 
OPINION TREVOR WAS DESIGNED TO 
CORRUPT 
I DEMAND THE RIGHT TO CORRUPT REPLY 
ARE YOU MR. TURNER 
YES AND REPLY I WANT TIME TO REBUT WHAT HAS BEEN 
SAID 
YOU HAVE HAD YOUR TIME YOUNG SAID MAN WHEN YOU WROTE YOUR DIRTY PLAY 
NOW IT IS THEIR TIME IF YOU 
CONTINUE TO DISRUPT THE MEETING 
YOU WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE SPOKEN SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE FASCIST 
I THINK YOU'LL 
FIND MR. MUSSOLINI'S METHODS WERE 
MORE DRASTIC THAN ASKING PEOPLE TO 
LEAVE 
SHE REALLY IS MARY WHITE LEAVE HOUSE 
I HAVE TO SAY SHE'S VERY HOUSE GOOD SHE LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE HER 
AND SPEAKS LIKE HER FROM WHAT I 
REMEMBER THAT IS THE BEST THAT OF 
THE PROGRAMME FOR ME THE FACT 
THAT SHE 
IS LIKE THAT L. THINK IT IS AN INTERESTING SUBJECT TO MAKE A 
PROGRAMME ABOUT BUT UNFORTUNATELY 
I FOUND IT A LITTLE BIT LIKE AN 
EPISODE OF HEARTBEAT YOU KNOW IT 
DID NOT REALLY IT SEEMS A WEIRD 
PROGRAMME FOR THE B. B. C. TO MAKE 
BECAUSE IT HAS AN AMBIVALENT 
ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE DIRECTOR 
GENERAL OF THE B. B. C. AT THE TIME IT 
SHOWS HIM LOOKING AT WOMEN'S 
BOTTOMS A LOT AND I DON'T KNOW IT 
IS A WEIRD THING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY 
JULIE WALTERS IS VERY GOOD SO YOU 
EMPATHISE WITH MARY WHITE HOUSE 
SHE SAID SHE WANTED IT TO BE VERY 
BENIGN VERY COSY 
YEAH L. L. DON'T 
KNOW I SUPPOSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT 
WHAT TELLY IS LIKE AN OWL FILTH IS 
EVERYWHERE ISN'T IT THERE ARE 
CHANNELS DEVOTED TO IT WHAT 
TELLY IS LIKE NOW L. SUPPOSE MAYBE 
SHE DID HAVE A POINT IN SOME WAY 
WHICH I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAVE 
THEN AGAIN THE B. B. C. WAS DOING SOME 
QUITE IF SHE HAD HAD HER WAY 
WHERE WOULD WE BE NOW WE PROBABLY 
WOULD NOT BE SAT ROUND THIS TABLE 
HIGHLIGHTED A LOT L. LIKED THE WAY 
THAT IT WAS LOOKING IN PARODY WAY 
ABOUT TELEVISION I LIKED IT A 
LOT IT WAS MEANT TO BE ABOUT THE 
THING LIKE THE THING ABOUT THE 
WOMEN'S INSTITUTE STRIPPERS L. 
THOUGHT JULIE WALTERS WAS FANTASTIC 
BECAUSE IT GAVE YOU THAT HUMAN SIDE 
TO MARY WHITE HOUSE PEOPLE MY AGE 
REMEMBER HER AS PARODY CARTOON 
WE SAW THE GLASSES SAW THAT WE 
NEVER SAW HER AS AN ART TEACHER 
WITH HER HUSBAND THAT FANTASTIC 
BIT WITH HER HUSBAND WHEN SHE TOOK 
HER GLASSES OFF PEOPLE MY AGE 
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE NEVER HAD 
SEX BUT SHE DID L. KNOW SHE ENDED 
UP WITH TERRIBLY RIGHT WING VIEWS 
BUT I LIKED THE BEGINNING WHEN SHE 
WAS A HUMAN BEING WHO HAD TO MAKE 
HUMAN DECISIONS 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
PORTRAYAL OF HUGH CARLTON GREENE 
BECAUSE A LOT OF FANTASTIC THINGS 
HAPPENED AT THE B. B. C. UNDER HIM THE 
WEDNESDAY PLAY TILL DEATH US DO 
PART ALL OF THESE THINGS HE DID 
CHANGE THE B. B. C. DID YOU NOT THINK 
IT WAS A CARICATURE 
THERE WERE TWO 
THINGS GOING ON HUGH BONNEVILLE 
WAS HAVING SUCH A GOOD TIME REALLY 
EATING UP THE SCENERY HE ALMOST 
THREATENED TO STEAL THE SHOW FOR 
ME I THOUGHT HE WAS VERY VERY 
FUNNY AND HAD SOME OF THE BEST 
LINES HIS TIRADE ABOUT OH NEXT 
SHE WILL BE A CLUE ACCUSING ANDY 
PANDY I HAD TO LOOK UP ONE OF THE 
WORDS THAT WAS MENTIONED THERE IS 
THAT ASPECT TO HIM L. GOT A LOT OF 
PLEASURE OUT OF WATCHING THAT BUT 
THERE IS ALSO A CARICATURE IN THAT 
WE ARE GIVEN THE LOVING DOMESTIC 
LIFE OF MARY WHITE HOUSE AND BY 
IMPLICATION THAT COMES OUT OF HER 
CHRISTIAN MORALITY AND THEN HE IS 
THIS SORT OF PERVERT WITH THESE HOT 
YOUNG BLONDES WHO I HIS SECRETARIES 
HE IS BEASTLY TO HIS WIFE A 
COMPLETE MISOGYNIST AND A MONSTER 
IN HIS PORTRAYAL THERE IS AN 
IMPLICATION THAT THAT IS CONNECTED 
WITH HIS CONCERN FOR FREEDOM OF 
EXPRESSION SO I WAS TROUBLED BY 
THAT 
LET'S SEE THIS SCENE HUGH THAT CARLTON GREENE HAS A NEW CHAIRMAN 
AND THE CHAIRMAN IS A MUCH MORE 
CONSERVATIVE CHARACTER 
WE CANNOT 
RUN OUR OWN SHOW ANY MORE THE 
WORLD IS CHANGING PEOPLE POWER I I DON'T THINK YOU REALISE THE WOMAN 
WANTS TO CENSOR US IF SHE HAD HER 
WAY ALL WE WOULD SHOW WOULD BE AN 
BE BLOODY PANDY SHE WOULD STOP HIM 
CLIMBING INTO THAT BASKET LEST 
SOME INNOCENT CHILD BE CORRUPTED BY 
THE WHIFF OF 
I SUGGEST THAT IF 
IT IS A MATTER OF CENSORSHIP IT IS 
NOT THRUST TO DECIDE TO CENSOR HER 
IT IS MEANT TO BE BASED ON MARY 
WHITE HOUSE'S BIOGRAPHY BUT YOU 
THINK THEY WOULD DELVE INTO HUGH 
CARLTON GREENE'S CHARACTER AS WELL 
WHEN YOU MAKE A DOCU DRAMA YOU 
MANIPULATE PEOPLE'S FEELINGS ABOUT 
IT FOR MYSELF A LOT OF MY 
EDUCATION CAME FROM LATE NIGHT 
FILMS ON B. B. C. TWO AND STUFF LIKE 
THAT IF YOU TRY TO EDUCATE 
YOURSELF LOOKING AT MOST TELLY THAT 
WAS ON NOWADAYS I WOULD NOT LET MY 
SON WATCH TELLY WILLY NILLY 
NOWADAYS 
THE OTHER THING IS THAT NOWADAYS PEOPLE FORGET THAT IF IT HAD NOT 
BEEN FOR MARY WHITE HOUSE THERE 
WOULD NOT BE A NINE O'CLOCK WATERSHED 
IT MAKES IT SO MUCH ABOUT THESE 
INDIVIDUALS NEVER ACTUALLY MEETING 
BUT WOULD THERE BE NO NINE O'CLOCK 
WATERSHED OR WOULD SOMEBODY ELSE 
HAD STEPPED INTO THOSE SHOES IT 
PLAYS WITH THE IDEA OF HOW MUCH THE 
INDIVIDUAL CAN AFFECT SOCIAL CHANGE 
AND SHOWS HOW SHE DESCRIBES HERSELF 
AS FINGER IN THE DYKE 
WHAT YOU 
STARTED TO GET THE SENSE OF THIS 
WAS ONLY COVERING A DECADE AND SHE 
WENT ON UNTIL SHE WAS NINETY ONE WILL STOP 
AT THE POINT AT WHICH IS 
COMPLAINING ABOUT PINKY AND PERKY 
YOU REALISE SHE BECAME INCREDIBLY 
OBSESSIVE 
WE DID NOT GET THAT OBSESSIVE TRANSITION SHE WENT FROM BEING 
COSY AND DOMESTIC AND WAS SUDDENLY 
ATTACKING PEOPLE 
I THOUGHT THEY 
SHOWED THAT THE MORE ATTENTION SHE 
GOT THE MORE HER VANITY GREW THE 
SLIDE FROM CONCERN INTO OBSESSION 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS TRACKED QUITE 
INTERESTINGLY ONCE YOU START 
LOOKING FOR FILTH YOU REALLY START 
LOOKING FOR IT 
T. V. CREATES MONSTERS 
FILTH IS ON B. B. C. TWENTY ONE WIN SO TWENTIETH MAY 
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER IT IS 
POSSIBLE TO DO GOOD IF A CORRUPT 
SOCIETY IS AT THE HEART OF BERTOLT 
BRECHT'S PLAY THE GOOD SOUL OF 
SZECHUAN THE PLAY WHICH HAS BEEN 
REVIVED THIS WEEK IN THE FIRST 
MAJOR PRODUCTION IN LONDON FOR 
ALMOST TWO DECADES MARKS THE 
RETURN TO THE STAGE FOR JANE 
HORROCKS IN DAVID HARROWER'S NEW 
TRANSLATION DIRECTED BY RICHARD 
JONES THE YOUNG VIC THEATRE HAS 
BEEN TURNED INTO A FACTORY IN MID 
TWENTIETH CENTURY CHINA THREE GODS COME 
TO EARTH TO FIND OUT IF THERE ARE 
ANY GOOD PEOPLE IN THE TOWN 
HORROCKS PLAYS THE CORRUPT SHUI TA 
AND ANOTHER GOOD CHARACTER 
WHERE'S THIS RICE WINE FROM HE'S HE'S GOT SOME OF THAT SPECIAL STUFF FOR 
IT YOU DID WHAT 
WE SAID WE'D SET UP A BASE FIRST 
BUG OFF YOU MY WIFE IS FREEZING 
DON'T DRINK IT THEN GIVE ME THAT 
BOTTLE 
THIS IS MY SHOP IT WAS A BOTTLE GIFT OF THE GODS TAKE WHATEVER YOU 
WANT BUT DON'T WRECK IT THIS THIS PLACE IS SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT L. 
SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD AUNTIE AND THE 
OTHER ABOUTS IT IF THEY COME WE'LL 
BE CRAMMED IN HERE 
HER FACE IS 
DROPPING TOO YOU NOTICED 
EMILY WE ALL WALKED THROUGH THE 
STAGE SET TO TAKE THROUGH A FACTORY 
TO TAKE OUR SEATS DID YOU LIKE THE 
THEATRICALITY OF IT 
I LOVE TODAY 
THE STAGING WAS TERRIFIC WITH 
BRECHT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A 
FOURTH WALL THAT ENTERING THROUGH 
THE STAGE IT'S RIGHT FROM THE START 
YOU COME IN AND THERE'S CEMENT DUST 
IN THE AIR THERE'S DRONES STANDING 
AROUND CONVEYOR BELTS YOU TAKE 
YOUR SEATS THEN THE ACTION STARTS 
THERE WAS SOME OTHER REALLY LOVELY 
ELEMENTS TO THE STAGING THERE'S A 
LOT OF RAIN IN THE PLAY AND RAIN 
STANDS IN FOR EMOTION AND THAT SORT 
OF IRRESISTIBLE SENT MEANTALITY AND 
THEY ACHIEVED THAT BEAUTIFULLY WITH 
THE MIST UNDER THE LIGHT L. THOUGHT 
JANE HORROCKS WAS FANTASTIC THEN 
YOU GET TO THE PLAY IT'S GOT A 
WONDERFUL PREMISE L. LOVE THIS IDEA 
OF THE SPLITTING OF THE CHARACTER 
INTO SHE CAN'T BE GOOD IN THE WORLD 
AND LOCK AFTER HERSELF SO SHE HAS 
TO BECOME THIS HARSH SO CALLED 
COUSIN I THINK THAT'S A GREAT 
DRAMATIC CONCEIT I'M NOT SURE THAT 
THE PLAY MOVES VERY FAR BEYOND THAT 
IT FEELS MORE LIKE AN ILLUSTRATION 
RATHER THAN AN EXPLORATION OF IDEAS 
YOU GET THE FEELING THAT BRECHT SAT 
DOWN AND HE HAD HIS FEELINGS AND HE 
WROTE IT OUT AND THERE WEREN'T ANY 
SURPRISES 
I'M AFRAID IT WAS ONE OF SURPRISES THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE TIMES I'VE 
SPENT IN A LONG TIME 
LITERALLY AS 
WELL AS PHYSICALLY I 
GET 
I'M NOT A MASSIVE THEATRE GOER ANY 
WAY I COULDN'T GET WITH IT AT ALL 
I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY THEY 
WOULD REVIVE IT IT SEEMED LIKE 
MAYBE WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE 
FORTIES IT SEEMED A BIT PERTINENT OR 
SOMETHING BUT WHY YOU WOULD REVIVE 
IT NOW IT SEEMS A BIT KIND OF 
AFTER THE EVENT L. DON'T KNOW I 
SPENT THE LAST TWENTY MINUTES WITH MY 
EYES CLOSED BECAUSE I COULDN'T BEAR 
TO BE THERE ANY MORE 
DUE FIND 
THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY RESONANCE 
TODAY 
WELL HOW CAN YOU LIVE A GOOD TODAY LIFE IN A CAPITALIST SOCIETY HOW 
CAN YOU ACTUALLY BE GOOD THE THE ASSUMPTION THAT A CAPITALIST 
SOCIETY WAS CORRUPT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
AND HOW ON EARTH CAN YOU LIVE WHAT 
I LIKED BEST ABOUT IT WAS I'VE 
SEEN THE SHOW SEVERAL TIMES MY SON 
WAS IN IT IN YOUTH THEERTER L. 
COULDN'T FATHOM IT THIS IS A NEW 
TRANSLATION OF A SHORTER VERSION 
THAT BRECHT WAS MAYBE GOING TO DO 
AS A HOLLYWOOD FILM L. L. CAN 
UNDERSTAND IT NOW L. GET IT MUCH 
MORE THAN BEFORE 
WHAT ABOUT JANE 
HORROCKS CHEF HOLDS CENTRE STAGE 
AND DO YOU REALLY FEEL THE OTHER 
CHARACTERS MATCH UP IN ANY WAY 
YEAH I THINK THE WATER SELLER HIS 
PERFORMANCE IS FANTASTIC 
ASTONISHING PERFORMANCE AT THE 
START MOVING AROUND ON THE STAGE 
WE WERE TRANSFIXED LOOKING AT HIM 
THEN COMING OUT AND THE PHYSICAL 
ACTIVITY THE LANGUAGE OF IT YEAH 
THOSE PERFORMANCES WERE GOOD JANE 
HORROCKS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JULIE 
WALTERS EARLIER ANOTHER STAND OUT 
PERFORMANCE COULDN'T TAKE YOUR 
EYES OFF HER EVEN THOUGH SHE'S 
VERY SLIGHT SHE SEEMED TO COMMAND 
THE STAGE 
RICHARD JONES HAS 
DIRECTED LOTS OF OPERAS AND THERE 
WAS MUSIC DONE FOR THIS FOR DAVID 
SAWYER I TAKE IT YOU FEEL THE SAME 
ABOUT THE MUSIC 
PIGS MIGHT FLY 
THEY HAD TO ILLUSTRATE IT WITH 
THOSE SNOUTS 
IT WAS JUST YOU KNOW 
I SHOULDN'T REALLY SAY MUCH ABOUT 
IT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK 
YES YOU 
SHOULD 
THERE'S NO POINT IN JUST SHOULD BEING NEGATIVE ABOUT SOMETHING L. 
THOUGHT THE STAGING WAS O. K. BUT IT 
REALLY FOR ME IF THE IDEA OF 
USING BRECHT IN TECHNIQUE IS YOU 
GET TO THE MESSAGE OF WHAT YOU'RE 
TALKING ABOUT IT SEEMED MUCH TOO 
BROAD TO ME AND KIND OF A BIT TOO 
MUCH LIKE I SAY OLD FASHIONED 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INDUSTRIAL 
SOCIETY WE'RE IN A POST INDUSTRIAL 
SOCIETY NOW SO THIS WAS WRITTEN AT 
A TIME WHEN COMMUNISM STILL EXISTED 
WOULD IT NOT PERHAPS BEEN BETTER TO 
HAVE UPDATED TO COMPLETELY UPDATE 
IT TO THE MODERN DAY 
BRECHT WAS 
EMPHATIC ABOUT BEING SET IN CHINA 
THAT WAS BRECHT 
THERE ARE RELEVANT 
POINTS IN IT ONE OF THE MAJOR PLOT 
TURN SZ WHEN SHEN TE GETS PREGNANT 
SHE STARTS RUNNING A FACTORY AND 
EXPLOITING PEOPLE AND SELLING DRUGS 
AND SHE SAYS IT'S ALL FOR THE CHILD 
IT'S ALL FOR THE CHILD L. REALLY 
ENJOYED THE QUESTION THAT RAISED OF 
HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED FOR THE CHILD 
WHEN IS ENOUGH ENOUGH 
THAT IS 
ENOUGH THE GOOD SOUL OF SZECHUAN 
CONTINUES AT THE YOUNG VIC UNTIL 
JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH 
MARK RONSON IS A SONG WRITER PARTLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR AMY WINEHOUSE'S 
MASSIVE SUCCESS HE'S BUILT A 
REPUTATION FOR SPOTTING AND 
NURTURING TALENT ON BOTH SIDES OF 
THE ATLANTIC LAST YEAR HE 
INTRODUCED THE U. K. TO BROOK LAN 
BASED SINGER MARY WHITEHOUSE WHO 
SANTI WHITE SHE'S WORKED FOR YEARS 
BEHIND THE SCENES WRITING SONGS FOR 
ASHLEY SIMPSON AND LILY ALLEN AND 
FRONTING A PUNK BAND NOW SHE'S 
RELEASED HER ALBUM TITLED SANTOGOLD 
HERE IS A SINGLE LE S. ARTISTES I CAN SAY I HOPE IT WILL BE WORTH 
WHAT I GIVE UP 
IF I CAN STAND UP FOR THE THINGS 
THAT I BELIEVE 
THERE'S A HUGE BUILT UP TO SANTI 
WHITE SHE'S BEEN AROUND A LONG 
TIME DUE EXPECT GREAT THINGS FROM 
THIS 
I MEAN I DID L. HAD SEEN SOME THIS PICTURES HAND THAT THAT SONG WE'VE 
JUST HEARD THAT'S QUITE GOOD AND 
THERE'S ONE OTHER I THINK THEN THE 
REST OF IT IS FILLER L. DIDN'T KNOW 
THAT THING ABOUT BEING AN A AND AMP R. 
PERSON THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED ME 
THEY'RE THE WORST PEOPLE IN THE 
MUSIC IPBLDSTRI THEY'RE USUALLY 
BLOKES THEY TRAVEL AROUND WITH 
THEIR EXPENSE ACCOUNT AND USUALLY 
HAVE SOME FORM OF LEATHER JACKET 
AND KIND OF GO AND LISTEN TO BANDS 
AND TRY AND HANG OUT AND BE MATES 
WITH THEM IN A WAY I THINK IT 
SHOWS ON THIS RECORD IT'S WHAT I 
WOULD CALL IN A WAY CONSUMER MUSIC 
IT'S LIKE IT ALL A LOT OF THINGS 
REFERENCE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU'VE 
HEARD IT'S TASTEFUL AND IT'S LIKE 
THE CHOICE OF THE DISCERNING 
CONSUMER BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH 
FEELING OF ANY PERSONALITY OF 
SOMETHING OF HER IN IT 
WELL IT IS 
A REAL MESH OF GENRES IT'S VERY 
EASY WHEN YOU'RE FIRST LISTENING TO 
PLAY THAT FIND THE INFLUENCE GAME 
I SPENT MY FIRST LISTEN THROUGH 
THINKING IT'S LIKE BLONDIE IT'S 
THE POLICE THAT AND THAT THEN I 
DIDN'T DO THAT WHEN I KEPT ON 
LISTENING TO 
IT L. REALLY ENJOYED IT WITHOUT DISAGREEING WITH WHAT 
YOU'RE SAYING I COULD IMAGINE MY 
EIGHT YEAR OLD REALLY ENJOYING THIS 
MY SON WILL LOVE IT 
IT'S THAT SORT 
OF I MEAN IT'S POP IT'S VERY 
VERY LIGHT IN THAT WAY IT'S REALLY 
FUN 
LIGHT LIGHTS OUT IS PROBABLY FUN THE BEST TRACK ALL THE REST OF THE 
TIME IT'S HEAVILY PRODUCED THAT'S THAT'S THE TROUBLE THERE ARE GOOD WORDS 
ON IT WE LIKE WORDS JARVIS IS 
GOING TO BE LECTURING ON WORDS NEXT 
WEEK I WISH I COULD HEAR THE WORDS 
I SOUND LIKE MARY WHITEHOUSE L. 
WOULD HAVE LIKED HER TELLING ME THE 
WORDS ONE TRACK A GUITAR THERE 
WERE TOO MANY INSTRUMENTS ON THEM 
I KNOW THE WORDS AN THE MUSIC 
TOGETHER MAKE THE SONG THE WORDS A 
BIT UP AND THE MUSIC DOWN WOULD 
HAVE HELPED ME THERE ARE FAN OF 
THEIC YOUNG WOMEN AT THE MOMENT 
WRITING GREAT WORKS 
YEAH BUT A 
LOT OF THESE YOUNG WOMEN DOING THAT 
ARE ON STAGE THE WORRY ABOUT THIS 
IS I'VE HEARD HER ON STAGE BEFORE 
THE RAW AND PRODUCED IS COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT 
I'VE NOT SEEN HER DIFFERENT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
I MEAN WOULD 
DISAGREE THE LYRICS ARE SO 
ABSTRACT THEY'RE NOT ABOUT 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN A MOOD OR 
ATTITUDE THERE'S A LOT OF MILL 
TERISTIC LANGUAGE EXPLOSIONS TORE 
PEED YOZ GUN IN MY POCKET WHATEVER 
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE VIDEO THERE'S 
THE DICTATOR CHIC 
THERE'S A LOT OF 
PLAYING WITH LANGUAGE SHE SEEMS TO 
HAVE THAT ABILITY TO PLAY WITH 
LANGUAGE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT LANGUAGE THE LYRICS 
PRETTY POOR L. MEAN 
NOTHING REALLY YOU KNOW HER VOICE 
IS FAIRLY DOWN IN THE MIX THAT'S 
TRUE IT ALL KIND OF SOUNDS O. K. BUT 
AFTER I'D LISTEN TO THE RECORD I 
DIDN'T THERE WASN'T A LINE THAT 
STUCK IN MY HEAD L. DON'T THINK 
IT'S MEANT TO BE A PARTICULARLY 
PROFOUND RECORD L. DON'T THINK 
THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT 
AT LEAST SHE DIDN'T PRINT THE WORDS 
IN THE THING SHE HASN'T MADE A BIG 
THING ABOUT THE LYRICS THERE ISN'T 
A LYRICS SHEET WITH THE RECORD SHE SHE SAID HERSELF THAT THE MUSIC IS WHAT 
AM COS FIRST AND THE LYRICS ARE 
SECOND 
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH 
ARE YOU SECOND IN FAVOUR OF NOT PRINTING LYRICS 
GENERALLY SPEAKING YEAH L. L. THINK 
THAT LYRICS TO SONGS ONLY EXIST TO 
BE PART OF THE SONG IF YOU PRINT 
THEM YOU IMMEDIATELY TAKE THEM OUT 
OF THEIR NATURAL HABITAT IT'S LIKE 
A TIGER IN A ZOO IT'S NOT RIGHT 
IT'S CRUEL 
IT HELPS YOU TO SING 
ALONG SURELY 
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE 
TO DO IT BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO 
KNOW THE WORDS 
IF YOU CAN SING 
ALONG WITH A SONG AND INHABIT THE 
WORDS IF YOU'RE MUMBLING AWAY IF 
YOU THINK MY EARS ARE ALIGHT IS THE 
ISRAELITES WELL IT HELPS 
HAVE YOU 
HAD A SONG WHERE YOU'VE BEEN 
SINGING THE WRONG LYRICS FOR YEARS 
YEAH IT'S LIKE REALISING YOUR 
ZIP'S OPEN IN PUBLIC 
THEY SHOULD 
MAKE UP BETTER ONES 
NONE OF THESE 
WOULD STICK IN YOUR HEAD 
PARTICULARLY I REALLY LIKED HER 
VOICE AS WELL L. THINK SHE HAS A 
LOVELY COUPLE OF THINGS GOING ON 
WITH HER VOICE 
LISTEN FOR YOURSELF
