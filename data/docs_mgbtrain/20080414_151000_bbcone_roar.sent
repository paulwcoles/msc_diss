LIONS ARE FIERCE BUT WHICH ARE CLEVERER MALES OR FEMALES 
AND IT'S CHAOS AT FEEDING TIME FOR THE LEMURS 
OOH HE'S TAKEN ERNIE'S GLASSES 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO ROAR 
I'M MATT AND I'M RANI THE NEW GIRL ON THE WILD ANIMAL PARK 
THROUGHOUT THE SERIES WE'LL BE GOING BEHIND THE SCENES 
HERE AT PORT LYMPNE AND ALSO AT HOWLETTS TO MEET AMAZING CREATURES 
LIKE THIS LEAPER AND THE KEEPERS THAT LOOK AFTER THEM 
WITH ONE THOUSAND FIFTY EIGHT ANIMALS TO CATCH UP WITH WE'VE GOT OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US 
SO LET'S GET GOING WITH TODAY'S SHOW 
HOWLETTS WILD ANIMAL PARK IS HOME TO FIFTY THREE WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLAS 
THE LARGEST COLLECTION IN HUMAN CARE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD 
ALL GORILLAS ARE EXTREMELY ENDANGERED IN THE WILD 
SO THE SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY BABIES HERE OVER THE YEARS 
INCLUDING NINE WHO HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO THE WILD 
IS VITAL TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE SPECIES 
BUT SOMETIMES A NEW MOTHER JUST CAN'T COPE AND REJECTS HER NEWBORN 
SO THE GORILLA KEEPERS STEP IN AND TAKE CARE OF THE BABY FOR HER 
BUT WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING MUM TO A GORILLA 
KEEPER DONNA HONEY IS FINDING OUT 
HELLO 
COME ON IN 
THIS IS DONNA'S HOME 
HAVE WE STILL GOT A SNOTTY NOSE 
AND IT'S ALSO CURRENTLY HOME TO TWO BABY GORILLAS DONNA'S LOOKING AFTER 
NINE MONTH OLD OUDIKI AND FIVE MONTH OLD KOUKI 
WHO BOTH NEED TO BE HAND REARED 
BECAUSE THEIR MOTHERS COULDN'T CARE FOR THEM PROPERLY 
THEY'LL STAY WITH HER UNTIL THEY'RE AT LEAST A YEAR OLD 
AND MATURE ENOUGH TO MOVE BACK IN WITH THE OTHER GORILLAS 
LET'S GO AND CHANGE YOUR PANTS READY FOR WORK 
BABIES NEED TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE WHETHER THEY'RE HUMANS OR GORILLAS 
SO IT MEANS A LOT OF EXTRA WORK AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR DONNA 
I SUPPOSE IT IS A BIT LIKE HAVING KIDS OF YOUR OWN 
JUST IN THE WAY THERE ARE LITTLE THINGS 
THAT A MUM WOULD NOTICE WITH HER CHILD 
LIKE WHEN THEY FIRST CRAWL OFF OR GET OFF THEIR BACK ON THEIR OWN 
THE FIRST TEETH COMING THROUGH THINGS LIKE THAT 
THESE LITTLE GORILLAS HAVE TO WEAR NAPPIES 
SO THEY DON'T MAKE A MESS INDOORS 
BUT WHENEVER POSSIBLE DONNA TRIES HARD NOT TO TREAT THEM LIKE HUMANS 
SHE DOES EVERYTHING SHE CAN 
TO HELP THEM GROW UP WITH THEIR NATURAL INSTINCTS INTACT 
WE VERY MUCH TRY AND DETACH OURSELVES FROM THEM 
AND THE ONE REALLY IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE LIKE A GORILLA MUM 
AND PICK HIM UP HOW A GORILLA MUM WOULD 
OUDIKI SEEMS TO LIKE TRAVELLING ON THE LEG 
BUT THEN THAT'S QUITE NATURAL IT'S HOW HE TRAVELS WITH HIS MUM 
OBVIOUSLY YOU DO GET ATTACHED 
BUT IT'S BEST FOR BOTH YOU AND THE GORILLA IF YOU DON'T 
AS THEY GET OLDER THEY ALSO DON'T LIKE HAVING THEIR PANTS PUT ON MUCH 
HE DID GO THOUGH A PHASE OF BEING QUITE PERSISTENT 
HE'D SOMETIMES BITE YOU IF YOU HELD HIM DOWN TO PUT THE PANTS ON 
BUT HE SOON LEARNT THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO GET AWAY WITH IT 
AND HAS TO HAVE THEM ON 
I SUPPOSE JUST LIKE A NORMAL CHILD 
THEY TRY AND TEST AND SEE WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T GET AWAY WITH 
NOW WE NEED TO WIPE YOUR NOSE COS YOU'RE SNOTTY AS WELL 
THEY'VE BOTH HAD COLDS KEEPERS HAVE HAD COLDS AS WELL 
GENERALLY WHAT THE ANIMALS GET THE KEEPERS SOMETIMES GET AND VICE VERSA 
WITH THE KIDS UP AND DRESSED 
WORKING MUM DONNA NEEDS TO GET TO THE OFFICE 
LET'S GO TO WORK THEN 
OFF YOU GET OUDIKI 
BUT FIRST THE SCHOOL RUN 
SHE DROPS THEM OFF AT THEIR NURSERY IN ONE OF THE GORILLA HOUSES 
FORTUNATELY THERE'S NO TRAFFIC IN THE PARK 
SO SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING LATE 
IN THE DAY TIME WHEN I GO TO WORK CAN BE A BREAK FOR MYSELF 
WHICH CAN BE QUITE NICE 
YOU GIVE THEM TO SOMEBODY ELSE BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT CAN SEEM A BIT MAD 
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN STAYING UP IN THE EVENING AND NIGHT TIME WITH THEM 
AND THEN SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S HAD THE EVENING AND NIGHT TO THEMSELVES 
GETS THE PLEASURE OF PLAYING WITH THEM DURING THE DAY 
YOU SOMETIMES THINK WHAT AM I DOING 
BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE A BREAK FROM THEM 
BUT NOT THAT YOU DON'T MISS THEM OR ANYTHING 
UP THEN YOU TWO 
TIME FOR WORK 
BUT WILL THEY CRY WHEN MUMMY LEAVES THEM 
STAY WITH US TO FIND OUT IF THEY GO APE IN THE NURSERY 
LEMURS ARE THOUGHT TO BE THE ANCESTORS OF ALL OTHER MONKEYS 
AND THEY CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN THE WILD ON THE ISLAND OF MADAGASCAR 
OFF THE EAST COAST OF AFRICA 
KEEPER ERNIE THETFORD HAS INVITED US TO COME AND FEED THEM 
BUT I CAN'T SEE ANY OUT HERE 
ERNIE WHERE ARE THE LEMURS PLEASE 
THEY'RE WAITING PATIENTLY INSIDE I'VE BEEN DOING SOME CLEANING 
I'M WAITING TO PUT THE FOOD OUT BEFORE I LET THEM OUT 
GREAT CAN WE CHUCK THIS OUT THEN CERTAINLY CAN 
ALL OF IT ON HERE ERNIE 
HALF OF IT WOULD BE GREAT HALF O. K. 
WHERE WILL THE OTHER HALF GO 
ON SOME OTHER BENCHES DOTTED AROUND SO IT'S SHARED OUT A BIT BETTER 
WE'VE GOT SOME NICE FOOD HERE DELICIOUS LOOKING STUFF 
I'D BE HAPPY TO EAT THIS I'D HOPE SO I CERTAINLY WOULD 
I THINK I'D LIKE DRESSING ON MINE 
HOW'S THAT ERNIE IS THAT ENOUGH TO LET THEM OUT YEAH PERFECT 
O. K. DO YOU WANT TO RADIO THE KEEPER AND WE'LL GO FOR IT DO YOU WANT TO 
SHALL I WOO NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE 
LEMURS CAN YOU PLEASE RELEASE THE LEMURS 
HERE THEY COME HERE THEY COME 
THERE WAS NO HESITATION LOOK AT THEM BOUNDING AWAY 
SO CUTE 
RIGHT OVER THE HEAD A GOOD BOUNCE THERE 
ERNIE WHAT TYPE OF LEMURS HAVE WE GOT BLACK AND WHITE RUFFED LEMURS 
ONE OF MANY VARIETIES THAT COME FROM MADAGASCAR 
THE ONLY PLACE IN THE WORLD THAT THEY'RE FOUND 
THEY'RE SO GORGEOUS THEY'VE GOT HUGE TAILS 
YOU'VE GOT QUITE A FEW DO THEY HAVE NAMES 
YES WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL NAMES FOR THEM 
IT HELPS TO TELL THEM APART WHEN YOU'RE KEEPING RECORDS 
THEY LOVE JUMPING OVER OUR HEADS 
WHAT'S THIS CACKLING THAT THEY'RE DOING 
THE FEMALES ARE DOMINANT TO THE MALES AS USUAL 
YES AND THIS MALE WAS CACKLING IN SUBMISSION TO THE FEMALE 
CAN YOU POINT OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FEMALE AND MALE 
I CAN'T TELL OH MY GOODNESS 
WHO'S THIS ONE YOU CHEEKY MONKEY 
THERE'S NOT AN OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE 
THERE'S SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN THE COAT PATTERNS THAT WE CAN TELL APART 
THERE'S NOT SOMETHING THAT TELLS EVERY FEMALE FROM EVERY MALE 
THEY SEEM INCREDIBLY TAME THESE ARE BOTH MALES 
THEY'RE QUITE ATHLETIC 
THIS IS CYCLONE THE OLD FEMALE MOTHER OF MOST OF THEM 
THEY SEEM REALLY GENTLE THEY'VE GOT VERY GENTLE HANDS 
THEY'VE GOT SOME QUITE SERIOUS TEETH I NEVER REALISED THAT 
OH LOOK AT THAT THEY'RE SO LOVELY 
HELLO GORGEOUS OOH HE'S TAKEN ERNIE'S GLASSES ONCE AGAIN 
ERNIE'S LOST HIS GLASSES 
THAT WAS REALLY NAUGHTY LET'S SEE IT AGAIN 
I THINK WE SHOULD PUT OUT THE REST OF THE FOOD AND LEAVE 
BEFORE THIS GOES TERRIBLY WRONG 
WHEN DO VAMPIRES LIKE HORSE RACING 
I DON'T KNOW 
WHEN IT'S NECK AND NECK 
WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK DO FISH HATE 
FRY DAY 
WHY DO GORILLAS HAVE BIG FINGERS 
I DON'T KNOW 
BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT BIG NOSTRILS 
OH THAT'S DISGUSTING 
BIG CAT KEEPER CHRIS HALES 
SEEMS TO THINK HE'S GOT A LOT OF SMART LIONS HERE IN PORT LYMPNE 
SO HE'S DEVISED AN I. Q. TEST TO FIND OUT JUST HOW CLEVER THEY ARE 
WE'RE GOING TO RUN IT AS A CONTEST 
BETWEEN LAYLA AND JABIR THE TWO BEAUTIFUL BARBARY LIONS 
SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIND OUT HOW SMART LIONS ARE 
I WAS GOING TO BRING A CROSSWORD PUZZLE 
BUT THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE A BETTER IDEA YES 
THEY'RE NOT TOO GOOD AT READING 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS PUT THEIR FAVOURITE TOYS HERE TWO BALLS 
THAT'S THIS YES THEIR FAVOURITE TOYS 
JABIR'S A GREAT FOOTBALLER 
WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY PUT THEM UNDERNEATH THE BINS O. K. 
THEY'LL WATCH US PUT THE TOYS UNDERNEATH AND COME OUT 
THEY'LL FLICK IT WITH THEIR PAW BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT'S UNDERNEATH 
SO THEY USE THEIR IMAGINATION THEIR MEMORY 
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY WATCH US PUT THE TOYS UNDER THE BINS 
IF THEY FLIP IT WITH THEIR PAW THEY'RE CLEVER YES O. K. 
YOU SHOULD GO OVER AND MAKE SURE THOSE CATS PAY ATTENTION 
HAVE YOU SEEN THESE CLAW MARKS VERY IMPRESSIVE 
UM HMM OFF YOU GO 
I'LL MAKE SURE THEY'RE PAYING ATTENTION 
SO WE'VE GOT THEIR FAVOURITE TOYS BOTH GOT BALLS WE'VE GOT TWO BINS 
ONE WITH LAYLA'S NAME AND ONE WITH JABIR'S NAME AND THEY CAN'T READ 
THEY CAN'T READ SO THEY MIGHT NOT RECOGNISE THIS 
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE WATCHING 
LAYLA JABIR WATCH THIS 
GOOD BOY ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION 
THIS IS AN I. Q. TEST 
AND YOU'RE DOING IT FOR THE BOYS 
WE'VE GOT THAT ATTENTION RIGHT THEN BALLS ARE GOING DOWN 
HERE WE GO AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THEY SEE THEM YEAH JABIR 
DON'T LOOK AWAY COME ON GUYS LAYLA'S GOT HER EYE ON IT 
SHE'S A GIRL SHE PAYS ATTENTION 
IN IT GOES LET'S CHECK WITH MATT 
I TELL YOU I THINK JABIR THINKS THAT I'M HIS FAVOURITE NEW TOY 
LAYLA'S BEEN UP THERE SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S HAVING A SNOOZE 
BUT SHE'S CERTAINLY BEEN EYEBALLING 
LAYLA'S VERY CLEVER WHATEVER YOU DO IN THIS ENCLOSURE SHE WATCHES 
SO QUITE HONESTLY I THINK SHE'S GOING TO BE THE SMARTEST 
I THINK WITH WOMEN WE DO PAY ATTENTION WE DO FOCUS 
SO I THINK LAYLA'S GOING TO WIN 
I'LL TAKE THAT BET I RECKON IT'S BLOKES EVERY TIME 
JABIR HAS BEEN WATCHING YOU LIKE A HAWK 
STOPWATCHES AT THE READY LET'S PUT THESE CATS TO THE TEST 
TIME FOR US TO MAKE A SHARP EXIT 
WE'LL BE BACK WITH THE LIONS LATER 
TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED 
NOW BACK TO DONNA HONEY THE LUCKY KEEPER WHO GETS TO LOOK AFTER 
TWO BABY GORILLAS 
WHILE THAT MIGHT SOUND LIKE THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD 
IT'S ACTUALLY A BIG RESPONSIBILITY FOR HER 
DONNA ALSO HAS A FULL TIME DAY JOB 
AND THAT'S HELPING TO CARE FOR THE PARK'S FIFTY TWO OTHER GORILLAS 
THIS IS 
THE PART OF THE DAY WHEN I GET AWAY FROM THE KIDS 
I GET TO COME TO WORK AND SEE TO THE OTHER GORILLAS THAT WE'VE GOT 
NOT THAT I DON'T LIKE BEING WITH THE KIDS 
IT'S NICE JUST TO SPEND TIME WITH THE OTHER GORILLAS 
AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM REALLY 
WHILST DONNA'S HARD AT WORK 
HER LITTLE ONES ARE AT THE NURSERY WITH HEAD GORILLA KEEPER 
LORNA WANLESS 
LORNA'S SEEN MORE THAN TEN BABY GORILLAS HAND REARED 
DURING HER YEARS AT THE PARK 
AND IS ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S LEADING EXPERTS ON THE SPECIES 
SO WHAT DO LITTLE OUDIKI AND KOUKI GET UP TO 
WHEN THEIR FOSTER MUM'S BUSY ELSEWHERE 
THEY SPEND ALL DAY IN THERE JUST SO THEY CAN CLIMB ON EVERYTHING 
AND GET USED TO BEING AROUND OTHER GORILLAS AS WELL 
IT'S LIKE A GORILLA SCHOOL 
WE'VE GOT LOTS OF ROPES MOVEABLE OBJECTS 
THERE'S SOME PLATFORMS ABOVE US JUST TO GET THEM USED TO CLIMBING 
AND THINGS MOVE AS WELL NOT EVERYTHING'S SOLID WHEN THEY CLIMB 
IT'S GOOD FOR THEIR MUSCLE TONE AS WELL CLIMBING AND BEING ACTIVE 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THEY SPEND TIME AROUND GORILLAS 
SO THEY CAN SEE AND SMELL OTHER GORILLAS 
IF THEY'RE GOING TO GO BACK INTO A GORILLA GROUP AT SOME TIME 
THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE A GORILLA AND NOT A HUMAN 
AND LEARN GORILLAS' SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR 
WHAT WE TRY AND DO IS ACT LIKE A GORILLA 
AS MUCH AS WE CAN MAKE GORILLA VOCALISATIONS 
THOSE VOCALISATIONS INCLUDE OVER TWENTY FIVE RECOGNISABLE NOISES 
WHICH THEY USE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER IN MUCH THE SAME WAY WE USE WORDS 
ONE OF THE NICEST SOUNDS IS THEIR VERSION OF LAUGHING 
BUT HOW DO YOU GET A GORILLA TO GIGGLE 
WELL TICKLE THEM OF COURSE 
THEY'RE VERY TICKLISH 
WHEN GORILLAS PLAY THEY ACTUALLY USE THEIR TEETH 
IF YOU SEE GORILLAS IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE BITING 
BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY TICKLING EACH OTHER 
SO WE TRY AND BITE THEM WITH OUR MOUTHS 
BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE COS THEY'RE COVERED IN POO 
IT'S NOT VERY NICE TO HAVE THAT IN YOUR MOUTH YUK 
BUT LORNA DOES TRY HER VERY BEST TO TREAT THE YOUNG GORILLAS 
JUST LIKE THEIR MOTHERS WOULD 
THAT MEANS TICKLING PLAYING TEACHING FEEDING 
AND KEEPING THEM SAFE 
AFTER ALL THAT 
IT MUST BE REALLY HARD NOT TO BOND WITH THESE ADORABLE CREATURES 
YOU DO GET ATTACHED TO THEM YOU CAN'T NOT 
SO YES YOU DO GET ATTACHED 
BUT YOU DO HAVE TO REMEMBER AS WELL THAT THEY ARE GORILLAS 
AND WE'RE HERE TO GET THEM TO LEARN TO BE AS GORILLA LIKE AS POSSIBLE 
THE NURSERY CLOSES AT FIVE P. M. SO FOSTER MUM DONNA 
WILL BE BACK SOON TO PICK UP THE KIDS 
SHE'LL HAVE DONE A FULL DAY'S WORK BUT SHE'LL STILL HAVE TO GET 
THE TERRIBLE TWOSOME TO BED IF THEY'LL LET HER 
WE'LL BE THERE TO SEE HOW SHE GETS ON 
RIGHT ALL YOU COMPUTER GAMERS PAY ATTENTION 
HAVE YOU PLAYED THE ROAR GAME ON THE CBBC WEBSITE 
THE AIM OF THE GAME IS TO CREATE AND RUN THE BEST ANIMAL PARK 
YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AFTER YOUR ANIMALS LIKE THIS GORGEOUS LEMUR 
THE BETTER YOU DO THE MORE VISITORS YOU GET 
ON EVERY PROGRAMME WE'LL GIVE YOU A CHEAT CODE 
TO HELP YOU UNLOCK CERTAIN FEATURES 
TODAY'S CODE IS ON YOUR SCREEN NOW 
IF YOU'RE AN EXPERIENCED PARK KEEPER YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY FOUND 
THESE FEATURES 
WHY NOT CHECK OUT WHAT YOUR FRIENDS THINK ABOUT YOUR PARK 
WITH RATE MY PARK 
HAPPY GAMING 
EARLIER ON THE SHOW 
WE CAME MET CHRIS HALES WHO HAS HELPED US SET UP AN I. Q. TEST 
FOR THE BIG LIONS 
THE IDEA IS WE PUT THEIR FAVOURITE TOYS 
UNDERNEATH DUSTBINS IN THE ENCLOSURE 
THEY CAN'T SEE THEM BUT THEY SAW US PUTTING THEM UNDER THERE 
LAYLA WILL BE VERY GOOD AT THIS 
LAYLA SEEMED TO BE CONCENTRATING STOP SHAKING YOUR HEAD 
BOYS ALL THE WAY JABIR'S ALMOST DEFINITELY GONNA WIN 
BUT WE'RE GOING TO TIME THEM 
I'M TIMING JABIR I'M TIMING LAYLA CHRIS WHO'S GOING TO WIN LAYLA 
DEFINITELY I'M WITH YOU LET THE LIONS OUT 
THREE TWO ARE YOU READY HERE WE GO YEP YEP 
START THE WATCH LAYLA IS FIRST OUT THERE SHE GOES 
OH SHE'S GONE FOR THE YES 
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL I BEG TO DIFFER YOU SEE 
JABIR IS EATING HIS TOY WHILE SHE'S TAKEN THE BIN 
YEAH WOMEN ARE OBSERVANT AND CURIOUS 
AND THEY WANT TO SEE NEW TOYS RIGHT 
NEITHER HAVE GONE FOR THE BALLS 
LAYLA'S RUN OFF WITH HER BIN AND JABIR IS FOLLOWING HER 
WOULD YOU SAY THOUGH LIONS ARE VERY INTELLIGENT 
THEY ARE INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT 
IN THE WILD YEAH THEY HAVE TO HUNT 
HUNTING IS WHAT THEY DO AND TO CATCH THEIR PREY 
THE PREY'S QUITE INTELLIGENT THEY HAVE TO BE CUNNING 
BASICALLY THEY'VE GOT TO BE DECEPTIVE 
THEY HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL SILENT STEALTHY 
AMAZING AS WELL AS BEING INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT 
LOOK AT THE STATE OF THAT DUSTBIN SMASHED TO SMITHEREENS 
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO BE ON THE RECEIVING END OF THAT 
YOU SAW THE HOLES AND THEY'RE SOLID PLASTIC YEAH 
THEY CHEW STRAIGHT THROUGH THEM 
WE STILL HAVEN'T DECIDED WHO WAS THE CLEVEREST OUT OF THESE TWO 
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO TELL WHO WAS THE FASTEST 
MY STOPWATCH SAYS EIGHTY TWO SECONDS 
WHAT DOES YOURS SAY LAYLA WAS THE FASTEST WASN'T SHE 
THEME FROM CHARIOTS OF FIRE 
STRAIGHT TO THE BIN BUT SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY PICK UP A BALL 
I DIDN'T QUITE STOP IT UNTIL SHE'D RAN OFF WITH THE BALL 
I FORGOT TO STOP THE STOPWATCH EIGHT POINT FOUR FIVE JABIR ALL THE WAY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M NOT UNFORTUNATELY CLOCKS DON'T LIE 
SHE DID GET THERE FIRST IT'S JUST THAT SHE RAN OFF WITH THE BIN O. K. 
DO YOU THINK IT'S BEEN A SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT IT KIND OF HAS 
THEY BOTH WENT FOR THE BINS AND THEY KIND OF REALISED THAT THE BINS 
ARE FAR MORE EXCITING THAN THEIR FAVOURITE TOYS 
SO THEY WENT AFTER THEM INSTEAD 
WELL WE CAN SAY THAT CATS ARE CLEVER BUT JABIR'S THE BRIGHTEST 
THEME FROM CHARIOTS OF FIRE 
I STILL THINK IT WAS LAYLA 
IT'S THE END OF THE DAY 
FOR BABY GORILLAS OUDIKI AND KOUKI 
TIME FOR THEIR FOSTER MUM TO PICK THEM UP AND TAKE THEM HOME 
DONNA'S ALREADY DONE AN EIGHT HOUR SHIFT 
BUT LOOKING AFTER THESE TWO MEANS HER WORK IS FAR FROM OVER 
WE'VE HAD A VERY BUSY DAY TODAY 
AND NOW IT'S FINALLY OVER 
WE'RE GOING TO SIT IN THE HIGH ROAMING CAGE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR 
TO GET THEM USED TO IT AND PLAYING IN THERE TOGETHER 
THE EVENTUAL AIM IS THAT THEY STAY IN THERE TOGETHER 
AND I CAN GO AND EAT AND SHOWER WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT THESE TWO 
IT'S O. K. TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT BUT THEY CAN'T GET IN THE BATH WITH ME 
AND I CAN'T LEAVE THEM TO RUN AROUND THE HOUSE 
DONNA'S LIFE WILL BE A LOT EASIER WHEN THE KIDS ARE OLD ENOUGH 
TO BE LEFT ON THEIR OWN 
SHE HOPES IT'S NOT TOO MUCH LONGER 
THEY HAVE BEEN INTERACTING MORE LATELY 
BUT THEY DON'T SEE EACH OTHER AS COMFORT 
WE'RE WAITING FOR KOUKI TO HOLD HER OWN A BIT MORE 
COS OUDIKI IS A LITTLE BOY AND HE'S VERY BOISTEROUS WANTS TO PLAY 
I THINK AT THE MOMENT KOUKI OCCASIONALLY 
ENJOYS PLAYING WITH OUDIKI BUT I'D SAY THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME 
HE'S A BIG ANNOYING BULLY QUITE OFTEN RUNNING AT HER TEETH BARING 
ABOUT TO JUMP ON HER AND POUNCE ON HER AND PLAY 
BUT SHE HAS MADE HIM CRY A FEW TIMES BY BITING HIM BACK 
AS YOU CAN SEE KOUKI'S BITING HIM AND TELLING HIM TO GET OFF HER 
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE STARTED CRYING THE WAY SHE'S BITING HIM 
SHE'S GOING TO BITE YOUR HAND YOU DON'T LIKE THAT 
USUALLY AROUND HALF SEVEN EIGHT O'CLOCK 
THEY START TO GET A BIT TIRED 
THIS IS A VERY GOOD TIME OF DAY FOR ME 
I KNOW THAT ONCE I'VE PUT THEM TO BED 
I ONLY HAVE TO GIVE THIS LITTLE ONE ONE MORE BOTTLE 
AND I CAN JUST RELAX UNTIL THEN 
BABY GORILLAS CAN DRINK THE SAME POWDERED MILK AS HUMAN BABIES 
OF COURSE IF THEY WERE STILL WITH THEIR MOTHERS 
THEY'D SUCKLE MILK NATURALLY 
UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR MUMS 
BUT THEY DO HAVE THE NEXT BEST THING DONNA 
I USUALLY FEED THEM BOTH TOGETHER 
THAT WAY THERE'S NO JEALOUSY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
DO YOU WANT TO COME OVER HERE IT'S NOT FAR 
KOUKI'S GOING TO BE FINISHED HERS 
YOU'RE BEING VERY SILLY AREN'T YOU 
YOU WANT IT OVER THERE O. K. 
OH DEAR 
IT'S THEIR LAST BOTTLE THEY DRINK IT IN THE CAGE 
AND AS SOON AS THEY'VE DRUNK IT THEY COLLAPSE AND FALL ASLEEP 
YOU CAN ALMOST DO A COUNTDOWN AS TO WHEN THEY FALL ASLEEP 
FOSTERING THE BABIES IS A L. O. T. OF HARD WORK 
BUT IF DONNA CAN BRING THEM UP SUCCESSFULLY 
WITHOUT THEM THINKING THEY'RE HUMAN IT WILL ALL HAVE BEEN WORTHWHILE 
IT IS VERY REWARDING YOU NOTICE THINGS THEY DO 
THEM DOING THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME 
COS YOU'VE BEEN THE PERSON GETTING UP IN THE NIGHT AND SEEING TO THEM 
HELPING THEM GROW 
THAT'S THESE TWO SORTED FOR THE DAY 
SO HOPEFULLY THOSE TWO WILL SLEEP FOR THE NIGHT 
AND I CAN FINALLY GET SOME REST 
SLEEP TIGHT DONNA 
WE'VE COME UP TO THE DISCOVERY ZONE TO MEET KEEPER SARAH WILLS 
TO GIVE A CHAMELEON A COOL BEDTIME TREAT 
I'VE GOT CHILLED FINGERS BECAUSE WE HAVE A TRAY OF ICE 
SARAH WHAT'S THIS FOR IT'S SO THEY CAN DRINK IT ONCE IT MELTS 
WE'VE GOT A FEMALE IN THIS SIDE AND A MALE IN THERE HIDING SOMEWHERE 
THERE SHE IS 
SO SHE'S GOING TO DRINK THE ICE CUBES 
WHEN THEY MELT THEY DRIP ON TO THE LEAVES AND SHE'LL JUST DRINK OFF IT 
WHY NOT DRINK OUT OF A BOWL THEY DON'T REGISTER BOWLS OR PUDDLES 
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO SEE SOMETHING DRIPPING 
SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WILD COS THEY DON'T HAVE ICE CUBES 
IT'S USUALLY RAIN DRIPPING ONTO THE LEAVES OR DEW ON THE LEAVES 
SO THEY CAN HAVE A GOOD OLD DRINK 
THEY SEE IT DRIPPING AND DRINK THE DRIPS 
SHE IS THE MOST GORGEOUS COLOUR IS IT TRUE THAT SHE CAN CHANGE COLOUR 
CHAMELEONS HAVE GOT A CHEMICAL IN THEIR SKIN AND THEY CHANGE COLOUR 
THEY DO IT WITHOUT REALISING LIKE WHEN WE BLUSH 
THEY DO IT WITHOUT REALISING IS IT IN RESPONSE TO THEIR BACKGROUND 
YES WITH THEIR BACKGROUND OR ALSO TO ATTRACT MATES 
OR TO SHOW THE MOOD THEY'RE IN 
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER CHAMELEON WE'LL PUT THAT IN HIS CAGE 
IS THIS A MALE YES IT'S THE MALE HE LOOKS BIGGER YEAH HE IS BIGGER 
HE'S GOT A BIGGER HEAD AS WELL ARE HIS EYES MOVING INDEPENDENTLY 
IS THAT NATURAL YES IT IS FOR CHAMELEONS THEY MOVE INDEPENDENTLY 
THEY CAN MOVE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES AND THEY CAN SEE ALL AROUND THEM WOW 
IMPRESSIVE THEY'VE GOT VERY GOOD EYESIGHT YES 
THEY RELY MOSTLY ON THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY EARS 
THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY HEAR US IF I WAS TO YELL O. I. NOTHING 
YEAH DIDN'T FLINCH SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP 
AND HE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK IF HE WAKES UP YEP 
TIME TO PUT THE SHOW TO BED CHECK OUT WHAT'S ON OUR NEXT ROAR 
THE BELOVED LIONESS HAS BEEN ATTACKED HER WOUNDS ARE INFECTED 
CAN SHE BE SAVED 
IT'S HORRIBLE THAT THIS POOR ANIMAL IS LITERALLY BEING EATEN ALIVE 
A KEEPER COMES FACE TO FACE WITH HIS RHINOS 
AND SO DOES OUR VERY FIRST ROAR RANGER AMAZING 
AND THE TIGERS' MISSION 
IS TO CLIMB UP THIS POLE BUT WILL THEY GO FOR IT 
DON'T MISS IT IT'S GGGGGRRRREAT
