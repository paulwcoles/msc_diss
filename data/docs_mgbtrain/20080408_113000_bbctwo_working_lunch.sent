GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO 
TUESDAY'S WORKING LUNCH I'M ADAM 
SHAW HOUSE PRICES ARE FALLING AT 
THEIR STEEPEST RATE IN NEARLY FIFTEEN 
YEARS YEARS TODAY'S HALIFAX SURVEY 
MAKES SOME 
GRIM READING FOR 
HOME OWNERS 
BUT 
WHAT WILL 
IT MEAN 
FOR RENTERS AND 
WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR RENTERS AND THEIR LANDLORDS 
SEVERN 
WITH 
A 
THIRTY FIVE MILLION 
FINE AND ADMITS LYING 
ABOUT LEAKAGE I'LL BE TALKING TO 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
AND ROB'S COUNTING THE COST OF 
COASTAL EROSION 
THIS IS HAYSBOROUGH ON THE NORTH 
NORFOLK COAST A VILLAGE WHERE 
OVER 
A CLIFF 
TOP 
BECAUSE JUST 
A FEW 
YEARS 
AGO WAS 
A 
STRETCH OF 
LAND 
BEYOND 
ME WITH 
MORE THAN TWENTY HOMES 
AND BUILDINGS THEY HAVE ALL NOW 
COLLAPSED INTO THE WAVES L. WILL BE 
REPORTING ABOUT HOW THE SEA IS 
EATING WHITE BRITAIN'S SHORELINE 
DEFENCES HAPPISBURGH 
PLUS FOUR TENORS FOR EVERY VIEWER 
CLASSICAL QUARTET BLAKE WILL BE 
HERE TO TELL ME ABOUT THE CHANGING 
BUSINESS OF THE CLASSICAL MUSIC 
INDUSTRY INDUSTRY HOUSE PRICES FELL BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT LAST 
MONTH THAT IS THE BIGGEST MONTHLY 
DECLINE SINCE SEPTEMBER NINETEEN NINETY TWO THOSE 
FIGURES COME FROM THE U. K.'S LARGEST 
MORTGAGE LENDER THE HALIFAX THE 
LONGER TERM TREND IS NOT QUITE SO 
SEVERE PRICES ARE STILL ELEVEN PER CENT 
HIGHER THAN THIS TIME LAST YEAR 
DESPITE THE FALL NONE THE LESS 
MARCH'S DECLINE WAS MUCH WORSE THAN 
MANY EXPERTS HAD EXPECTED 
ALONGSIDE THE LAST ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGE 
WAS TAKEN OFF THE MARKET LAST NIGHT 
WITH PRICES FALLING FEW PEOPLE 
ABLE TO GET ON 
THE LADDER 
WHAT 
DOES THAT 
MEAN FOR THE RENTAL 
MARKET RACHEL 
HAS BEEN HAVING A 
LOOK LOOK IT IS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER FOR 
FIRST TIME BUYERS TO GET A MORTGAGE 
LAST NIGHT ABBEY THE LAST LENDER 
TO OFFER A DEPOSIT FREE LOAN WITH 
TO THE DEAL AND ANALYSTS PREDICT 
NINETY FIVE PER CENT MORTGAGES COULD SOON FOLLOW 
EVEN BUYERS HAVING TO FIND AT LEAST 
A TEN PER CENT DEPOSIT IS THIS GOOD NEWS 
FOR ANYONE WELL IT COULD BE IF 
YOU HAVE BOUGHT A LET WITH FEWER 
FIRST TIME BUYERS 
ABLE TO 
GET ON 
THE LADDER THE DEMAND FOR RENTALS 
IS RISING FIGURES FROM ONE OF THE 
U. K. BUS BUT BIGGEST BUY TO LET 
MORTGAGE LENDERS SHOW THAT AVERAGE 
RENTAL INCOME HAS RISEN FROM AROUND 
TEN THOUSAND A YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND SIX TO ALMOST 
TWELVE THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
AT THE MOMENT IF 
YOU ARE AN EXISTING PROFESSIONAL 
LANDLORD TIMES ARE QUITE GOOD THE 
INDICATIONS ARE THAT RENTAL DEMAND 
WILL INCREASE OVER THE NEXT FEW 
MONTHS AND THAT IS AS A 
RESULT OF 
A NUMBER 
OF FACTORS 
THERE 
PEOPLE LOOKING TO RENT MORE THAN 
BUY AND IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO 
EXPAND YOUR PORTFOLIO AND FIFTY PER CENT OF 
THE MEMBERS ARE SAYING THEY ARE 
LOOKING TO EXPAND ITS PORTFOLIO 
THEN THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE QUITE 
GOOD AND IT IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT 
IF YOU 
ARE IN THE MARKETS 
TO 
MORTGAGES AND REMORTGAGES AT THIS 
TIME BUY TO LET 
MORTGAGES HAVE 
TIME BEEN 
ON THE 
MARKET FOR MORE THAN TEN 
YEARS TODAY 
THERE ARE 
MORE THAN ONE 
MILLION OF THEM OUTSTANDING WITH A 
TOTAL VALUE OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO BILLION THEY 
MORTGAGE MARKET RENTS 
ARE GOING 
UP AND THAT CHAP IN 
YOUR REPORT SAYS IT IS ALL HUNKY 
DORY FOR LANDLORDS BUT PROPERTY 
PRICES 
ARE FALLING SO THE ARE FALLING BUT CAN'T BE GOOD NEWS 
THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT PROPERTY 
PRICES ARE FALLING THAT MEANS 
FEWER PEOPLE WANT TO BUY PROPERTY AND THEY ARE 
GOING TO 
CHOOSE TO 
RENT THAT IS GOOD FOR LANDLORDS 
THEY 
CAN CHARGE 
MORE RENT 
MONEY 
BECAUSE MORE 
OF 
US WANT 
WHAT THEY 
HAVE GOT BUT EQUALLY THOSE 
PROPERTY PRICES FALLING MEANS THEIR 
CORE 
ASSETS ARE 
DECLINING 
IN VALUE 
THAT IS BIG PROBLEM FOR 
LANDLORDS WHO BOUGHT INTO THE BUY 
TO LET MARKET WANTING TO GET THEIR 
MONEY BACK OUT OF THE APPRECIATION 
VALUE IN THE PROPERTY RATHER THINKING ABOUT 
WHAT THE 
MONTHLY 
RENTALS WERE GOING TO BE THOSE 
LANDLORDS MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO PUT 
MARKET AND 
SELL 
IT NOW 
ESPECIALLY SINCE 
CHANGES TO 
CAPITAL GAINS 
IN AT THE WEEKEND 
THIS TIME 
LAST 
WEEK LANDLORD COULD BE PAYING FORTY FIVE 
PER CENT THAT HAS GOT TO EIGHTEEN PER CENT THE MAN WE 
HEARD THERE SAID THAT THE SORT OF 
LANDLORDS WHO WOULD BE SELLING 
WOULD NOT BE THE 
MORE ESTABLISHED 
LANDLORDS IT IS GOING TO 
BE THOSE 
LENGTH OF TIME I THINK THAT IF THE 
IMPACT IS 
TO BE 
SEEN ANYWHERE 
IT 
WILL BE 
MORE IN 
THE AREA OF PEOPLE 
WHO GOT INTO THE MARKET RECENTLY 
MORE SPECULATORS LOOKING FOR A 
CAPITAL GAIN THEY ARE 
TO CONSIDER GETTING 
OUT OF 
MARKET IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS 
WHEREAS 
THOSE PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE 
BEEN 
IN IT 
IN IT FOR THE LONG TERM A MILE ARE MORE 
LIKELY TO STAY WE 
WE SHOULD ALSO 
SAY ALTHOUGH 
PRICES 
COME DOWN 
IN THE 
PAST MONTH THEY 
ARE STILL UP ON THE YEAR TALKING 
ABOUT THE 
A HUGE 
AMOUNT 
OF TENANTS 
ARE OUT 
THERE HOW 
WILL THAT 
AFFECT ANYONE 
WHO IS 
RENTING OR THINKING OF 
RENTING IT COULD HAVE QUITE AN 
IMPACT I 
REMEMBER 
FROM WHEN 
I WAS 
RENTING 
THE PRESSURE 
WAS ALWAYS ON 
HE 
TURNED UP 
FOR A 
VIEWING AND YOU 
HE TURNED UP FOR A VIEWING AND YOU NEEDED THE 
CASH IN 
YOUR POCKET FOR 
A 
DEPOSIT NOW 
MORE PEOPLE WANT TO 
A DEPOSIT NOW MORE PEOPLE WANT TO RENT 
THAT PRESSURE

THE PLAN 
INVOLVED 
SHAREHOLDERS SWAPPING 
THEIR SHARES 
FOR SHARES IN 
COMPANY CALLED 
GROUPE

MIKE RAKE SAID 
MR. VERWAAYEN HAD

THIRD OF ALL THOSE BOUGHT 
THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE 
GOVERNMENT'S WASTE ADVISORY BODY 
WASTE AND RESOURCES ACTION 
PROGRAMME WE ARE ALSO DUMPING FIFTY ONE 
MILLION POTATOES A DAY TWENTY EIGHT MILLION 
TOMATOES SIXTEEN MILLION BANANAS AND 
MILLION ORANGES HOW THEY COME 
TO THIS FIGURE AND WHO GOES THROUGH 
THE BIN BAGS COUNTING ISN'T CLEAR 
LET'S GO OFF TO THE MARKETS 
HALIFAX SAID THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A 
HOME FELL AND THE HOUSING MARKET IS 
PERFORMING VERY POORLY AS WE HAVE 
HEARD IT 
IS BEING REFLECTED IN 
SHARE PRICES TODAY YOU 
COULD 
THE MARKET GENERALLY 
GOT OFF TO A 
BAD START 
THE HOUSING SECTOR 
PARTICULARLY BAD 
EACH ONE 
OF THESE 
REPRESENTS A SHARE ROAD BLOCKS ARE 
DOWN AND 
BLEW UP 
MOST OF THOSE ARE 
DOWN THESE ARE THE PERCENTAGE 
MOVEMENTS A LOT OF THEM LOSING 
ABOUT THREE PER CENT 
VALUE TODAY 
L. 
CAN 
TAKE SOME 
OF THOSE AND FLY THEM 
UP THERE THIS IS THE CHANGE WE 
ARE LOSING FIVE FOUR PER CENT TODAY WE COULD 
NOT EVEN FIT THE RED BAR ON 
BARRATT HAS LOST SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT OF ITS VALUE 
THE BEST ONE I HAVE GOT HIS ELWAY 
WHICH HAS LOST HALF OF ITS VALUE 
OVER THE PAST YEAR IN THE HOUSING 
SECTOR REALLY UNDER PRESSURE 
LOOKING AROUND THE MORE WIDELY HELD 
SHARES IT IS MIXED L. THINK WE 
WILL SEE THE F. T. S. E. DOWN RIGHT NOW 
WE WILL CHECK ON THAT 
IN A 
MOMENT 
ONE ITEM OF NEWS THE GAMBLING 
COMPANY EIGHT THREE ONE NINE NINE REPORTED RECORD 
PROFITS FOR THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND IT 
STARTED AS WELL ITS FIRST FULL 
YEAR OPERATING WITHOUT THE U. S. 
THEIR PROFITS MORE THAN DOUBLED UP 
ONE HUNDRED SIX PER CENT IT SHOWS PICKED UP VERY 
STRONGLY IN FEBRUARY WHEN IT 
REPORTED A 
BIG JUMP IN REVENUES AS 
REPORTED A BIG JUMP IN REVENUES AS WELL THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WOULD 
NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF 
A FOREIGN 
TAKEOVER OF BRITISH 
WIDESPREAD RUMOURS OF A TAKEOVER 
HERE THERE WAS A BIG RISE 
IN ITS 
SHARE PRICE ON FRIDAY ON THURSDAY 
THIS SHARE 
WAS TRADING 
AT SIX SIXTY TWO P. SO 
DOWN TODAY BUT STILL HUGE VALUE IN 
THAT THE MEDIA SECTOR UNDER 
PRESSURE AS WELL THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED DOWN 
FIFTY ONE POINTS 
THE WATER FIRM SEVERN TRENT IS 
BEING FINED THIRTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION TODAY FOR 
POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND LYING 
HAS BEEN 
LEAKING FROM ITS PIPES IN A MOMENT 
I'LL BE TALKING TO SEVERN TRENT'S 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE TONY WRAY FIRST 
HERE'S SIMON WITH THE DETAILS 
THE WATER INDUSTRY IS NOT LIKE ANY 
OTHER IT IS PRIVATISED BUT THE 
COMPANIES DON'T COMPETE INSTEAD 
THEIR EVERY MOVE IS MONITORED AND 
SCRUTINISED BY THE WATER 
REGULATOR OFWAT WHICH TELLS THEM 
WHAT THEY CAN CHARGE IF THEY 
INVEST AND SERVE THE CUSTOMER WELL 
THEY ARE REWARDED WITH HIGHER 
PRICES IN THIS WEIRD WORLD OF 
WATER SEVERN TRENT LIED ABOUT ITS 
RECORD ON LEAKS TO WHICH IT HAS 
PLEADED GUILTY TO DAY IN COURT BUT 
WHAT HAS ENRAGED OFWAT IS THAT OVER 
EIGHT YEARS IT DELIBERATELY GAVE 
FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT SOME OF ITS 
SERVICE STANDARDS AND SLOPPILY 
MISREPORTED ON OTHERS OUR OUR INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN IN RELATION 
TO CUSTOMER SERVICE INFORMATION 
AND THE 
REASON WE ARE 
TAKING THIS 
VERY SERIOUSLY IS BECAUSE THE 
COMPANY DELIBERATELY 
CUSTOMERS DON'T HAVE 
A CHOICE 
THEY 
CAN'T CHOOSE THEIR SUPPLIER SO 
THERE ANY PROTECTION IS THROUGH THE 
REGULATOR FOR US TO PROTECT THEM 
WE NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH THE THE DETAIL FOURTH OF OFWAT'S CASE 
AGAINST SEVERN TRENT TELLS AN 
ALARMING STORY OF HOW A PRIVATISED 
MONOPOLY CAN SLIP OUT OF CONTROL 
GIVE ITS CUSTOMERS THE BRUSH OFF 
AND MANIPULATE REAMS OF INFORMATION 
TO TRICK THE AUTHORITIES INTO 
ALLOWING IT TO CHARGE MORE WHEN 
CUSTOMERS RANG OR WROTE IN WITH 
QUERIES ABOUT THEIR ACCOUNTS 
SEVERN TRENT'S WATER PRICES WOULD 
HAVE BEEN LOWER IF THE DECEPTION 
AND SLOPPY REPORTING HAD NOT 
HAPPENED SO IT IS REDUCING THIS 
YEAR'S BILLS BY TWO POINT FOUR OH PER CUSTOMER 
BUT THE CONSUMER COUNCIL FOR WATER 
HAS ISSUED A 
STATEMENT SAYING 
IT 
THINKS THAT THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION FINE 
SHOULD 
ALSO BE EMPLOYED 
TO BENEFIT 
SHOULD ALSO BE EMPLOYED TO BENEFIT WATER USERS 
WE CAN NOW GO TO THE CLASSICAL 
MUSIC INDUSTRY IT IS WAITING FOR 
THE CLASSICAL BRIT AWARDS THEY 
WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT 
HALL NEXT MONTH THE CLASSICAL 
MUSIC INDUSTRY HAS BEEN POPULAR 
RECENTLY AND BLAKE ARE HOPING TO 
WIN THE BEST CLASSICAL ALBUM OF THE 
YEAR AWARD AND HERE THEY ARE IN 
ACTION 
THERE WE ARE THE BEST LOOKING MEN 
EVER TO GRACE THE WORKING LUNCH 
STUDIO STUDIO BLAKE ARE HERE AS WELL 
YOU CAN TALK TO US ABOUT YOU MAKE 
MONEY FROM THE CLASSICAL MUSIC 
INDUSTRY WE ARE JOINED BY THE 
EDITOR OF GRAM OWE PHONE MAGAZINE 
IS IT STEPHEN AND JULES 
YES YES HOW DID YOU COME TOGETHER 
IT WAS 
AN UNUSUAL THING JULES AND OLLY 
WANTED TO PUT A GROUP TOGETHER AND 
WE HAD SAW G. FOUR AND IL DIVO AND THEY 
WANTED TO GET GUYS TO SING AND DO 
WEDDINGS AND THEY FOUND MYSELF AND 
DOM THROUGH FACEBOOK IT WAS THE 
EASIEST WAY TO FIND PEOPLE PEOPLE 
WITH AN INTEREST IN SINGING THEY 
FOUND US AND WE FOUND A MANAGER IN 
FACEBOOK AND WE WERE GIVEN A RECORD 
DEAL BY UNIVERSAL RECORDS 
JAMES YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT G. FOUR 
COMING TO THE FRONT THERE AND THAT 
DOES SEEM TO BE CLASSICAL MUSIC 
IT SEEMS TO BE POPULAR LOADS OF 
PEOPLE WHO WIN THE TALENT 
COMPETITIONS SEEM TO BE CLASSICAL 
OR OPERA SINGERS 
THERE IS A LOT OF 
GREAT SIGNS THERE THE INDUSTRY FOR 
BETTER OR WORSE CATEGORISES IT INTO 
TWO REAMS IF YOU LIKE SO YOU HAVE 
CORE CLASSICAL AND CROSSOVER AND I 
MEAN THE WEIRD THING ABOUT IT 
SOMETIMES IS SOME CROSSOVER IS 
MARVELLOUS AS IF THESE GUYS 
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU ARE SAYING 
BUT THE LINKS WITH CLASSICAL MUSIC 
THERE ARE LINKS AND I HOPE AS A FAN 
OF CORE CLASSICAL THAT IT BRINGS 
PEOPLE INTO THE CENTRE AND THERE IS 
EVIDENCE THAT THAT THAT IS 
HAPPENING HAPPENING STEPHEN YOU ARE NOW NOT JUST JUST 
DOING WEDDINGS AND THE LIKE YOU'RE 
ON THE ROAD AS BAND HOW LONG DID 
IT TAKE YOU TO MAKE A LIVING 
ASSUME YOU ARE MAKING LIVING WE WE ARE ARE BEING A MUSICIAN IS HARDER AT THE 
BEST OF TIMES BUT WE JUST CARRY ON 
DOING WHAT WE LOVE DOING AND THERE 
IS A LIVING TO BE MADE 
I WONDER HOW LONG IT TOOK YOU TO 
GET TO THAT STAGE 
WELL IT HAS BEEN QUICK FOR US IT 
HAS BEEN TEN MONTHS SINCE WE FIRST 
GOT TOGETHER 
SO YES FOR US IT HAS BEEN VERY 
VERY QUICK BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS 
HAPPEN THAT WAY 
DO YOU GET THE FEELING THAT IN FIVE 
YEARS TIME YOU WILL BE AROUND I I VERY MUCH HOPE SO WE ARE NOT IN 
THIS FOR THE SHORT HAUL EVERYTHING 
IS GOING WELL AT THE MOMENT 
GOOD GOOD I DON'T WANT TO JINX IT 
THE POINT ONE WAS TRYING TO GET TO 
JAMES IS IS THERE PARALLEL TO BE 
DRAWN IN THE POP WORLD BOY BANDS 
MIGHT GET TOGETHER AND THEY GET TO 
NUMBER ONE AND TWO YEARS LATER THEY 
ARE NOT THERE IN THE CLASSICAL 
WORLD PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE LONGER 
CAREERS MAYBE NOT AS BRIGHT ALWAYS 
BUT EVERYONE DOESN'T REMEMBER THEM 
IN THE SUPERMARKET QUEUE 
I THINK 
THERE IS SOME TRUTH IN THAT WE 
HAVE SEEN SOME CROSSOVER ACTS AND I 
HEARD THESE GUYS AROUND FOR A LONG 
TIME WHO COME ALONG AND MAKE A 
GREAT SPLASH AND DO A LOT OF GOOD 
BUT AREN'T AROUND FOR A WHILE BUT 
THERE ISN'T AS MUCH COMPETITION AS 
IN POP THERE ARE FEWER FEWER 
PEOPLE WHO BUBBLE TO THE TOP THEIR 
FAN BASE IS OLDER AND PROBABLY MORE 
LOYAL IN MANY CASES ARE GOING TO 
STICK WITH THEM BUT I MEAN THE 
OTHER THING TO SAY IS THAT 
CLASSICAL MUSIC IS VIBRANT AND 
EXCITING AT THE MOMENT WE ARE JUST 
HERE COMES THE PLUG DOING A COVER 
STORY ON GREAT COMPOSERS OF TODAY 
AND IT IS INCREDIBLE TO SEE HOW 
THEY HAVE RECONNECTED WITH THEIR 
STUDIOS THEY ARE WRITING GREAT 
TUNES PEOPLE ARE REALLY RESPONDING 
TO THAT 
O. K. O. K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
GUYS WE WILL BE HEARING YOU SING 
LATER ON AND IT IS DOMINIC 
WE WILL BE HEARING YOU SING LATER 
ON ON THANK YOU 
WE HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE THE 
PROBLEMS OF FLOODING INLAND BUT 
THERE IS THREAT TO MUCH OF 
BRITAIN'S COASTLINE 
SEA LEVELS ARE RISING AND DEFENCES 
BUILT IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES LOTS OF 
THEM ARE CRUMBLING OFFICIAL POLICY 
IS DEFEND KEY AREAS BUT MANY 
STRETCHES THE COAST ARE BEING GIVEN 
UP TO THE SEA AND THAT MEANS HOMES 
AND COMMUNITIES ARE UNDER THREAT 
ALL THIS WEEK ROB WILL BE LOOKING 
AT THE PROBLEM AND HE BEGINS BY 
REPORTING FROM A VILLAGE WHICH HAS 
SEEN HOUSES LITERALLY FALLING INTO 
THE SEA 
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN BAY ON 
NORTH FOLK'S SUNNY COASTLINE FIVE 
YEARS AGO IT WASN'T THERE BECAUSE 
THE COASTLINE WHICH IS ON MY LEFT 
LEFT SHOULDER WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT 
THERE OVER ON MY RIGHT SHOULDER 
SINCE THEN TWENTY SIX HOUSES AND ROAD 
HAVE FALLEN BENEATH THE WAVES THIS 
IS THE VILLAGE OF HAYBOROUGH 
IT IS LITERALLY THE ROAD TO NOWHERE 
THIS GARDEN THAT WE'RE WALKING IN 
NOW WAS HUGE AND IT IS JUST FEW 
YEARS AGO THAT WHERE THE GARDEN 
ENDED THERE WAS A ROADWAY 
THERE IS ROADWAY BEYOND THIS INDEED INDEED GOING ACROSS HERE 
YES AND THERE 
WERE PROPERTIES THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THAT ROAD 
MORE HOUSES RVINGTS YES YES YES THEY HAD MORE HOUSES 
PICTURES TAKEN BY THE CAMPAIGN SHOW 
HOW QUICKY THE SEA IS ADVANCING IN 
THE TWELVE MONTHS BETWEEN THESE TWO 
PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE TAKEN 
PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN THE SEA HAS 
TAKEN ANOTHER BITE OUT OF THE CLIFF 
AND BUNGALOWS AND CARAVANS 
DISAPPEARED DISAPPEARED THE RATE OF EROSION PICKED UP 
WITHIN THE LAST TWELVE OR SO YEARS 
IT IS ACTUALLY RUNNING AND HAS BEEN 
RUNNING FOR THAT TIME AT FIVE TIMES 
THE PREDICTED RATE THE EXPERTS IN 
NINETEEN NINETY TWO DREW UP A STRATEGY FOR HERE 
AND THEY PUT LINES ON A MAP AT TEN 
YEAR INCREMENTS AND THEY SAID THERE 
WAS NO POINT YOU JUST CAN'T 
PREDICT BEYOND SIXTY YEARS 
THEY DREW WHAT WE HAVE COME TO KNOW 
AS THE SIXTY YEAR LINE 
IN FACT THE SEA REACHED THAT POINT 
WITHIN TWELVE YEARS NOT SIXTY 
IT MEANS MEANS INSURANCE FOR HOMES 
NEAR THE CLIFF IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET 
THE HOUSES ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO SELL 
THIS ONE WAS VALUED AT JUST ONE 
THE OWNER KNOWS THERE WILL BE NO 
COMPENSATION IF IT FALLS INTO THE 
SEA SEA I'M GUTTED AREN'T YOU LIKE I JUST 
SAID YOU WORK YOUR LIFE TO PAY FOR 
SOMETHING AND YOU HAVE GOT TO START 
AGAIN WHERE AM I GOING TO GET 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FROM NOW YOU 
CAN'T GET IT IT IS RIDICULOUS 
IS THERE NO COMPENSATION 
NO NO 
PRESUMABLY YOU CAN'T GET INSURANCE 
NOT FOR THAT YOU GET YOUR NORMAL 
HOUSE INSURANCE BUT YOU LOSE IT IF 
IT GOES OVER THE EDGE YOU HAVE GOT 
NOTHING HAVE YOU 
YOU DON'T KNOW 
HOW LONG YOU HAVE GOT HERE AND 
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE WE SPENT 
ZERO YEARS PAYING FOR SOMEWHERE WHICH 
YOU KNOW WE WILL GET NOTHING FOR 
YOU WATCHED THE HOUSES AROUND YOU 
BEING WASHED AWAY YES YES THAT MUST BE DEPRESSING 
IT IS IT 
CAN GET YOU DOWN ESPECIALLY WHEN 
YOU ARE THINKING OF THE FUTURE WE 
HAVE ONLY GOT ANOTHER TEN YEARS TO 
WORK BEFORE WE RETIRE AND IF WE WE 
HAVE GOT TO PAY RENT FOR SOMEWHERE 
WHEN WE ARE OUT OF OUR RETIREMENT 
MONEY IT IS GO GO NOT GOING TO 
LEAVE US WITH A GREAT DEAL FOR OUR 
FUTUREMENT FUTUREMENT FOR OTHERS THE HOUSES ARE A FAMILY 
HOLIDAY BUT UNDER THREAT 
FOR YEARS AND YEARS IT SEEMED 
DISTANT PROBLEM AND THEN THE SPEED 
OF CHANGE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS 
REALLY TAKEN US ALL BY SURPRISE AND 
IT IS THE THOUGHT THAT EACH SUMMER 
MAYBE THIS IS THE LAST SUMMER 
MAYBE THIS IS THE LAST TIME WE WILL 
BE ABLE TO BRING THE KIDS UP AND AS 
A FAMILY ENJOY THE PLACE IT IS 
JUST FRIGHTENING REALLY MALCOLM MALCOLM ACCEPTS THAT THE SEA CONDITION BE 
HALTED BUT HE SAYS THIS PICTURE 
SHOWS IT CAN BE SLOWED AND CHEAPLY 
TOO WHERE THE SEA SEA DEFENCES 
HELD THE CLIFF BEHIND HAS ERODED 
FOR SLOWLY WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN 
BROKEN THE CLIFFS COLLAPSED HE 
SAYS WITHOUT MORE GOVERNMENT MONEY 
FOR SEA DEFENCES IT IS A FATE THAT 
AWAITS MANY COASTAL COMMUNITIES 
IT HASN'T BITTEN YET THAT'S THE 
THING THE PUBLIC ARE UNAWARE BUT 
ONCE YOU REALLY GET INTO IT AS I 
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS FOR FOR 
NINE YEARS IT IS HORRIFYING THERE 
ARE SOME VERY LITTLE KNOWN FACTS 
INVOLVED IN THIS THE COASTAL ZONE 
WHICH EUROPE IS SAYING THAT WE 
SHOULD TAKE NOTE OF STRETCHES TEN 
KILOMETRES INLAND ALL AROUND THE 
COAST IN THAT ZONE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE MILLION 
PEOPLE LIVE THAT'S THE OFFICIAL 
FIGURE SO WHAT YOU SEE HAPPENING 
HERE TODAY NOW HAS THE POTENTIAL 
TO TRANSFER ITSELF TO A SIGNIFICANT 
PROPORTION OF THAT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE MILLION 
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE HOLE APPROACH 
OF GOVERNMENT TODAY UNSUSTAINABLE 
FURTHER UP THE VILLAGE THOUGH 
PEOPLE ARE FEELING MORE SECURE AND 
THAT'S BECAUSE THE COUNCIL HAS BEEN 
SPENDING MONEY ON SHORING UP THE 
DEFENCES BRINGING IN THE ROCKS FOR 
EXAMPLE BUT THAT'S COST SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
WHICH IS A HUGE CHUNK OUT AFSMALL 
BUDGET TOMORROW I WILL BE 
SPEAKING TO THE COUNCIL TO FIND OUT 
HOW IT CARRIES OUT SEA PROTECTION 
AND FIND OUT WHY IT IS TRYING TO 
CHANGE NATIONAL POLICY ON THE 
EROSION OF BRITAIN'S COASTLINE 
BACK TO THE STORY ABOUT SEVERN 
TRENT BEING FINED FOR POOR CUSTOMER 
SERVICE AND LYING ABOUT HOW MUCH 
WATER HAS BEEN LEAKING FROM ITS 
PIPES PIPES INTERNATIONAL WHAT'S THE EFFECT WHAT'S THE 
EFFECT OF THE LIE YOUR COMPANY TOLD 
ON CUSTOMERS 
LET ME CLEAR THE 
BEHAVIOUR WE SAW WAS UNACCEPTABLE 
AND WE'RE ACCOUNTING FOR THAT THE 
IMPACT FOR CUSTOMERS IS NON 
EXISTENT AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE 
ALREADY REDUCED OUR BILLS TO TAKE 
ACCOUNT OF THIS SO THAT OUR 
CUSTOMERS HAVE NOT BEEN 
DISADVANTAGED AND THE FINE OF THIRTY SIX 
MILLION WILL BE PAID FOR BY THE 
COMPANY AND BY OUR SHAREHOLDERS 
ABSOLUTELY NOT BY OUR CUSTOMERS 
SO YOU ARE REDUCING THE DIVIDEND SO 
SO SHAREHOLDERS SUFFER AND NOT 
CUSTOMERS CUSTOMERS WE WILL BE PAYING THIS FROM OUR 
BALANCE SHEET AND OUT OF OUR 
RESERVES IT CAN NOT BE PAID FOR BY 
CUSTOMERS IT WILL NOT AFFECT OR 
ONGOING INVESTMENTS WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO INVEST OVER ZERO POINT FIVE 
BILLION A YEAR INTO OUR NETWORKS 
AND INTO THE MIDLANDS ECONOMY WE 
WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE IMPOSMT 
OF OUR BUSINESS AND WITH THE 
INVESTIGATIONS WE HAVE DONE AND THE 
CONTROLS WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE I AM 
CONFIDENT THIS IS NOT AN EPISODE WE 
WILL NEED TO RELIVE IN SEVERN TRENT 
HAS ANYONE BEEN SACKED AS A RESULT 
OF THE LIE 
WHEN WE CAME INTO THE 
COMPANY AND I AND MY TEAM STARTED 
OUR INVESTIGATIONS WHEN WE FOUND 
THESE THINGS WE WENT TO OUR 
REGULATOR AND EXPOSED THEM THE 
INVESTIGATION HAS TAKEN A LONG TIME 
TO DO DURING THE COURSE OF THAT 
WE RAN OUR DISCIPLINARY EXERCISES 
LET ME ASSURE ALL CUSTOMERS THAT 
THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS 
ARE NO LONGER WITH SEVERN TRENT 
RIGHT RIGHT THAT DOESN'T REALLY ANSWER THE 
QUESTION YOU ARE SAYING THEY LEFT 
VOLUNTARILY NO ONE WAS PUBLICLY 
HUE MAILIATED POR HUMILIATED OR 
PUBLICLY SACKED THE THE INDIVIDUALICATIONS ARE A MATTER OF 
CONFIDENTIALITY BETWEEN COMPANY AND 
INDIVIDUALS LET ME BE CLEAR 
NOBODY GOT REWARDED THOSE THAT 
WERE RESPONSIBLE WENT THROUGH 
DISCIPLINARY PROCESSES AND THEY ARE 
NO LONGER WORKING FOR SEVERN TRENT 
ONE WONDERS WHETHER YOUR INDUSTRY 
COULD BE RIFE WITH THIS SORT OF 
SHENANIGANS SOUTHERN WATER WERE 
THEY FINED WAS IT TWENTY MILLION FOR 
SIMILAR SORT OF ISSUE HERE 
MISREPORTING IT DOES SEEM TO BE AN 
INDUSTRY INDUSTRY PROBLEM YOU AND 
YOUR COLLEAGUES FACE CERTAINLY CERTAINLY THE QUALITY OF REPORTING IN THE 
INDUSTRY WAS BROUGHT INTO DOUBT AND 
SOUTHERN WERE FINE AS WERE 
OURSELVES WHAT WE FOCUSED ON 
WORKING WITH THE SERIOUS FRAUD 
OFFICE AND WITH OUR REGULAR OFWAT 
IS IS PUTTING IN THE HIGHEST 
STANDARDS OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR AND 
EFFECTIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS 
GREAT EMPHASIS ON INDEPENDENT AUDIT 
FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS INDEPENDENT 
AUDITORS SUCH I CAN ASSURE OUR 
REPORTING FOR QUITE SOMETIME AND 
NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE IS FULL 
FAITHFUL CORRECT AND TRANSPARENT 
DO YOU FEEL THAT IT WAS 
INCOMPETENCE OR MALICE BEHIND THE 
ORIGINAL HIGH 
LIE 
I THINK THERE ARE MANY 
THEORIES AND I DON'T THINK THERE 
WAS ANY ONE THING 
YOU HAVE INVESTIGATE IT HAD FOR 
THREE YEARS YOU TOLD US AT LENGTH 
HOW MUCH YOU HAD GONE INTO THIS 
HAVE YOU NOT COME TO ANY 
CONCLUSION 
WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION CONCLUSION THERE WAS DELIBERATE 
MISS REPORTING AND THAT'S WHY WE 
HAVE BEEN FINED WITH THE QUANTUM WE 
HAVE HOW THAT CAME ABOUT WAS A BAD 
CULTURE LACK OF OF CONTROLS TOO 
MUCH BUREAUCRACY AND WE HAVE TO 
TAKE ALL THAT AND HAVE TAKEN THAT 
OUT OF SEVERN TRENT AND REORGANISED 
THE BUSINESS CHANGED THE CULTURE 
AND WE HAVE AN ORGANISATION THAT IS 
GIVING TRUE FAITHFUL REPORTING AND 
IS COMMITTED TO DELIVERING THE 
HIGHEST STANDARDS TO OUR CUSTOMERS 
TONY RAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
INDEED INDEED ON CONSUMING ISSUES WE ARE 
ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT 
UTILITIES THAT'S IT FROM WORKING
