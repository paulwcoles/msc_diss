ON THE CAPITAL WE TALK TO SUDAN'S 
UN ENVOY AND A REBEL SPOKESMAN WE WE ARE READY FOR PEACE TODAY NOT 
TOMORROW IF THE SUDAN GOVERNMENT 
DOES NOT WANT TO LISTEN OTHER 
OPTIONS WILL BE TAKEN

ISRAELI SOLDIERS FEEL THEY CAN RELY 
ON PALESTINIANS TO BE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THEIR OWN SECURITY 
SHIPMENTS OF WATER ARRIVE IN 
BARCELONA AS SPAIN SUFFERS ITS 
WORST DROUGHT IN SIXTY YEARS IS THIS 
THE ANSWER OR SHOULD PEOPLE BE 
LESS WASTEFUL WITH WHAT THEY HAVE 
GOT GOT HELLO WELCOME IN CHINA IT'S A 
RACE AGAINST TIME TO REACH VICTIMS 
OF MONDAY'S EARTHQUAKE THE 
GOVERNMENT IN BEIJING SAYS THE 
SCALE OF THE DISASTER IN SICHUAN IS 
FAR WORSE THAN THEY PREVIOUSLY 
THOUGHT A HUGE SEARCH AND RESCUE 
EFFORT IS ON THE WAY IT HAS BEEN 
AN ARDUOUS PROCESS TO REACH THOSE 
TRAPPED UNDER PILES OF RUBBLE IN 
ONE OF THE MOST POIGNANT SCENES 
RELATIVES OF HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN 
KILLED AT A SCHOOL SAW THEIR 
BODIES BROUGHT OUT OF THE RUBBLE 
RESCUE IS HAMPERED ESPECIALLY IN 
THE MOUNTAINS AT THE QUAKE'S 
EPICENTRE THIS REPORT CONTAINS 
SOME DISTRESSING IMAGES RESCUERS 
HAVE BEEN SEARCHING THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY FOR EARTHQUAKE SURVIVORS 
SOMETIMES THEIR PATIENCE PAID OFF 
THIS GIRL WAS PULLED ALIVE FROM THE 
RUBBLE RUBBLE AT A HOSPITAL IN THE CITY OF 
DUJIANGYAN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE 
WERE FEARED TRAPPED WHEN PART OF IT 
FELL DOWN 
I SAW FRIENDS AND RELATIVES 
GATHERED AT THE HOSPITAL ENTRANCE 
FOR NEWS BUT THE FACES OF THE 
HOSPITAL WORKERS TOLD THEIR OWN 
STORY STORY ONLY ONE BODY WAS PULLED FROM THE 
HOSPITAL RUBBLE TODAY 
ACROSS THE CITY AT A MIDDLE SCHOOL 
ANXIOUS PARENTS ALSO AWAITED FOR 
NEWS THE SCHOOL COLLAPSED DURING 
THE EARTHQUAKE TRAPPING HUNDREDS 
OF PUPILS INSIDE MANY DIED AS I 
WENT AROUND DUJIANGYAN THERE WAS 
GENUINE FEAR THAT AFTERSHOCKS COULD 
CAUSE MORE DAMAGE AND PEOPLE 
ABANDONED THEIR HOMES FEARING THEY 
COULD STILL COLLAPSE 
THESE PEOPLE AROUND ME ARE SPENDING 
THEIR SECOND NIGHT IN THE OPEN AIR 
IT'S RAINING THERE'S NO POWER 
THERE'S NO WATER AND THEY FEAR 
THERE ARE GOING TO BE AFTERSHOCKS 
OTHERS DECIDED IT WAS BETTER TO 
LEAVE THE CITY ALL TOGETHER AND 
PACKED UP THEIR BELONGINGS 
SOLDIERS FROM CHINA'S PEOPLE'S 
LIBERATION ARMY WERE LEADING THE 
RESCUE EFFORTS 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY 
BEEN CONFIRMED DEAD AND THE 
AUTHORITIES FEAR THAT NUMBER WILL 
RISE AS RESCUERS REACH MORE 
ISOLATED AREAS 
TO GIVE AS YOU CLEARER IDEA OF WHAT 
CHALLENGES THE RESCUE WORKERS FACE 
IN HELPING ANY SURVIVORS WE ARE 
JOINED FROM WASHINGTON FROM THE 
VICE PRESIDENT OF EMERGENCY 
RESPONSE A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL AID 
AGENCY HE IS CO ORDINATING AID FOR 
BURMA AND CHINA 
WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES IN CHINA 
AND WHILE YOU ARE ANSWERING WE 
HAVE SOME PICTURES JUST RELEASED OF 
THE MOMENT WHEN THE QUAKE STRUCK IN 
CHINA ON MONDAY WHAT ARE THE 
PRIORITIES IN THE RESCUE 
OPERATIONS 
WELL RIGHT NOW WE ARE OPERATIONS IN THE VERY EARLY PHASES OF IT 
THERE ARE THREE BASIC PRIORITIES 
RIGHT NOW ON THE GROUND THE FIRST 
IS THE SEARCH AND RESCUE EFFORT TO 
GET PEOPLE OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE 
RUBBLE AND THE SECOND ONE IS TO 
STABLISE THE CRITICAL PATIENTS WHO 
HAVE BEEN WOUNDED AND RIFD AT 
HOSPITALS AND HEALTH POSTS AND THE 
THIRD ONE IS TO HELP PEOPLE IN 
STRUCTURE THAT IS MIGHT COME DOWN 
IN THE AFTERSHOCKS WHICH ARE BOUND 
TO CONTINUE FOR DAYS IF NOT WEEKS 
TIME IS TICKING THIRTY SIX HOURS HAVE GONE 
BY AND EVERY MINUTE COUNTS FOR THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAPPED 
YOU ARE 
FIGHTING ON ALL THREE FRONTS THERE 
THREE OPERATIONS AS IT WERE ALL 
GOING ON SIMULTANEOUSLY WHEN IT 
COMES TO HELPING THOSE PEOPLE 
TRAPPED IN THE RUBBLE YOU ARE NOT 
REALLY ABLE 
TO HELP 
HUNDREDS 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE YOU YOU 
ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ODD PERSON 
BEING RESCUED HERE AND THERE 
THAT'S RIGHT THAT IS THE TRAGEDY 
OF IT THE COMPLETE BREAKDOWN OF 
TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS 
AND INFRASTRUCK STUER SEVERELY 
IMPACTS THE ABILITY 
INFRASTRUCTURE SEVERELY IMPACTS THE 
ABILITY OF CHINESE AND 
INTERNATIONAL RESCUE TEAMS TO GET 
THERE WE ARE RACING AGAINST THE 
CLOCK TO GET THERE AS QUICKLY AS WE 
CAN WE KNOW THE STABLISATION AND 
RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD WILL BE LONG 
AND AS SOON AS WE 
CAN GET 
THERE THE 
MORE LIVES WE CAN SAVE 
YOU WERE 
VERY HEAVILY INVOLVED WITH THE 
TSUNAMI RELIEF OPERATIONS IN ASIA A 
FEW YEARS BACK CHINA THIS TIME 
IS ACCEPTING FOREIGN RELIEF WORKERS 
YOU ARE HAVING TO DEAL WITH 
CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN THE MIDST 
OF ALL THESE EMERGENCIES AREN'T 
YOU 
OUR WORK IN EMERGENCY RESPONSE YOU TAKES US TO ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT 
PLACES AND CIRCUMSTANCES EACH 
DISASTER COMES WITH ITS OWN 
CIRCUMSTANCES THIS PARTICULAR 
SITUATION WE'RE RESPONDING TO TWO 
MAJOR NATURAL DISASTERS AT THE SAME 
TIME IT DOES REMIND ME OF THE DAYS 
AFTER THE TSUNAMI WHEN WE WERE 
BASICALLY MOUNTING SIMULTANEOUS 
RESPONSES IN MULTIPLE COUNTRIES 
AND SO THE CHALLENGE FOR US IS TO 
MEET THE NEEDS THAT ARE GOING TO BE 
DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND 
DO SO AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN IN 
WIDELY VARIANT GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS 
TURNING TO BURMA THE MILITARY 
AUTHORITIES SAYING THANK YOU TO THE 
AID BUT NO THANK YOU TO THE 
FOREIGN RELIEF WORKERS HOW 
DAMAGING IS THAT 
WELL YOU KNOW 
THE CYCLONE IN BURMA WAS REALLY A 
DEVASTATING EVENT FOR A COUNTRY 
THAT WAS ALREADY POOR WITH LACKING 
INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE TWO RELIEF 
WORKERS ON THE GROUND IN YANGON 
THEY HAVE BEEN CO ORDINATING FOR 
DAYS NOW WITH THE RELIEF EFFORT 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO GET IN 
BADLY NEEDED MEDICINES AND MEDICAL 
SUPPLIES WE FEEL CONFIDENT WE WILL 
BE ABLE TO DELIVER THOSE CERTAINLY 
THE NEEDS THERE WILL BECOME MORE 
AND MORE ACUTE AS THE DAYS PASS 
AND THAT IS DEPENDANT ON OUR 
ABILITY AS AN INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY TO DELIVER AID TO THE 
PEOPLE IN THE DELTA 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED STAYING 
WITH BURMA THE UNITED NATIONS HAS 
APPEALED FOR AN AIR OR SEA CORRIDOR 
TO BE OPENED TO CHANNEL LARGE 
AMOUNTS OF AID TO THE VICTIMS OF 
THE CYCLONE THE UN SAID A MASSIVE 
RELIEF OPERATION IS NEEDED TO 
PREVENT A MASSIVE KNOCK ON 
CATASTROPHY CAUSED BY HUNGER AND 
DISEASE DISEASE BRIEFLY IN OTHER NEWS OFFICIALS 
IN INDIA SAY A SERIES OF BOMBS HAVE 
KILLED SIXTY PEOPLE IN JAIPUR DOZENS 
MORE WERE INJURED SEVEN BLASTS 
WENT OFF IN QUICK SUCCESSION IN THE 
OLD CITY AREA PACKED WITH SHOPPERS 
WITNESSES DESCRIBED SCENES OF PANIC 
FOLLOWED BY A STAMPEDE 
BRITAIN'S CHANCELLOR OF THE 
EXCHEQUER ALISTAIR DARLING HAS 
ANNOUNCED HE'S INCREASING THE 
INDIVIDUAL TAX ALLOWANCE OF ALL 
WORKERS BY SIX HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IT IS PART 
OF THE PLAN TO COMPENSATE THOSE WHO 
LOST OUT WHEN THE LOWEST TAX BAN 
WAS TAKEN AWAY 
PAKISTAN IS FACING SHORE POLITICAL 
CRISIS AFTER NAZWAR SHAR RIF PULLED 
HIS MINISTERS OUT OF THE COALITION 
AFTER THEY FAILED TO MEET A MONDAY 
DEADLINE ON HOW TO REINSTATE JUDGES 
SACKED BY PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF IN 
NOVEMBER LAST YEAR 
IN SUDAN SECURITY FORCES ARE STILL 
TRYING TO FLUSH OUT DARFUR REBELS 
WHO ATTACKED KHARTOUM'S TWIN CITY 
IT IS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE 
REACHED THE STATE CAPITAL THE 
MEDIA SAY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE KILLED 
AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED HAVE BEEN ARRESTED 
WITH THE ATTACK THE 
THE GOVERNMENT IS ACCUSING CHAD OF 
BACKING THE MOVEMENT GEM THEY HAIL 
FROM A TRIBE COMMON TO BOTH DARFUR 
AND CHAD DARFUR HAS SEVERED 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHAD 
I HAVE BEEN TALKED TO THE POLITICAL 
ADVISER TO KHALIL IBRAHIM THE 
LEADER OF THE JUSTICE AND EQUALITY 
MOVEMENT JEM I PUT IT TO HIM THAT 
THE REBELS HE ACTIONS PUT IN 
DANGER MANY LIVES OF THE INNOCENT 
CIVILIANS IN KHARTOUM 
JEM HAVE 
BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH THE SUDANESE 
GOVERNMENT FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT 
A SATISFYING AGREEMENT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS CONTINUING TO COMMIT 
GENOCIDE AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY HAVE FAILED TO FORCE THE 
GOVERNMENT TO STOP THE GENOCIDE 
YOU ACCEPT THAT THE LIVES OF 
CIVILIANS IN KHARTOUM WERE 
SERIOUSLY AT RISK BECAUSE OF YOUR 
MOVEMENT'S ACTIONS 
THESE CIVILIANS 
HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE SUDANESE 
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE 
KILLING EVERYBODY ASH TRAIRLY THE 
CIVILIANS KNOW JEM AND WELCOME THEM 
IN THE STREETS 
THAT IS WHAT YOU 
SAY THE SUDANESE AUTHORITIES WOULD 
SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT THE THING 
IS JEM IS NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING A 
BETTER DEAL FOR THE PEOPLE YOU ARE 
PROTECTING YOU ALSO HAVE AN 
ISLAMIST AGENDA WHICH YOU WISH TO 
IMPOSE ON THE SUDAN 
THERE IS 
NOTHING ABOUT IDEOLOGY HERE NOW WE 
ARE LOOKING FOR THE MARGINALISED 
PEOPLE HOW TO SHARE IN THE POWER 
HOW TO SHARE THE WEALTH HOW TO 
SHARE ALL OTHER CIVILIAN WORK AND 
SO ON 
BUT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE LINKS 
WITH ISLAMISTS IN THE CAPITAL AND 
THE IDEA IS TO OUST IT GOVERNMENT 
IN ORDER TO IMPOSE AN ISLAMISTIC 
AGENDA 
THIS IS ONLY AN ALLEGATION AGENDA FROM THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT TO 
EXPLOIT ISLAMOPHOBIA WHICH MOST 
COUNTRIES HAVE A FEAR ABOUT THEY 
WANT TO PORTRAY THAT JEM IS AN 
ISLAMIST MOVEMENT THESE ARE 
ALLEGATIONS 
WHERE DO YOU GO ON ALLEGATIONS FROM HERE THIS IS GOING TO MAKE 
MATTERS DIFFICULT FOR ANY TALKS 
BETWEEN YOU AND 
THE GOVERNMENT IF IF THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT IS READY 
FOR PEACE IT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY 
TO STOP IF THEY DON'T WANT TO 
LISTEN TO OUR PEOPLE OR ABIDE BY 
HUMAN RIGHTS IF THEY DON'T WANT TO 
GIVE THE PEOPLE THEIR RIGHTS THEN 
THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION AND JEM 
WILL DO THIS AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
GOVERNMENTS NEED TO URGE THE 
SUDANESE GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND TO 
THE PEOPLE 
MORE ATTACKS ON THE 
SUDAN 
IF THE GOVERNMENT ATTACK OUR SUDAN PEOPLE THE RETALIATION WILL NOT BE 
IN DARFUR ANY ATTACK IN DARFUR 
WILL BE IN THE CAPITAL 
WHAT ABOUT 
KHALIL IBRAHIM THE CHAIRMAN OF JEM 
THERE IS A BIG BOUNTY ON HIS HEAD 
THE AUTHORITIES WANT HIM CAUGHT HE HE IS INSIDE SUDAN 
WE ARE SUPPORTED BY OTHER COUNTRIES 
THEY SAY YOU ARE SUPPORTED BY CHAD 
WE CAME FROM THE HEART OF DARFUR 
THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT KNOWS THAT 
WELL 
IT IS NOT JUST THE SUDANESE WELL GOVERNMENT THAT SAYS PERHAPS THERE 
IS SOME KIND OF SUPPORT FROM CHAD 
BECAUSE OF COURSE IT IS A COMMON 
TRIBE BETWEEN DARFUR AND CHAD AND 
THERE IS THIS QUESTION OF ARMS AND 
FIGHTERS COMING ACROSS THE BORDER 
IT IS NOT A MATTER OF TRIBAL THE 
TRIBAL INTERACTION BETWEEN ALL 
BORDERS NOT ONLY SUDAN OR CHAD 
BUT YOU GET HELP FROM ACROSS THE 
BORDER FROM CHAD 
ALL THE VEHICLES 
HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
FOR TWO YEARS 
NO ARMS NO FIGHTERS 
COMING IN FROM THE CHAD BORDER NO NO IT IS ONLY AN ALLEGATION FROM THE 
SUDANESE GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE TO 
FIND ANY OTHER WAY TO DEFINE 
THEMSELVES BUT NOT TO SAY THESE 
ALLEGATIONS ALLEGATIONS THAT WAS A SPOKESMAN FOR THE JEM 
REBEL DARFUR GROUP IN LONDON 
JOINING US LIVE FROM NEW YORK IS 
SUDAN'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED 
NATIONS NATIONS JUSTICE AND EQUALITY MOVEMENT SAY 
UNLESS YOU TALK TO THEM UNLESS 
PEACE COMES ONE WAY OR ANOTHER 
THERE WILL BE MORE ATTACKS ON 
KHARTOUM 
THE STATEMENT MADE BY MY KHARTOUM FELLOW SUDANESE LOOKS LIKE A JOKE 
THAT WILL ENTERTAIN NOBODY INDEED 
THE THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
FAILURE OF THE RECENTLY CONCLUDING 
TALKS MEDIATED BY THE E. U. AND THE 
UNITED NATIONS I WANT TO KNOW WHY 
THEY DID NOT COME WHEN THE 
LEADERSHIP OF JEM THEY ALSO 
DECLARED THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO 
COME THEY SAID THINGS SHOULD BE 
NEGOTIATED HONESTLY THIS IS WHY 
THEY MADE THIS SUICIDAL ATTACK 
AGAINST THE CAPITAL BECAUSE THEY 
WANT TO PRE EMPT ANY COMMENCEMENTS 
OF THE PEACE TALKS THEY WANT THE 
DARFUR CAKE TO BE FULLY SWALLOWED 
BY THEM THEY DON'T WANT 
DISTRIBUTION OF POWER WITH FELLOW 
DARFUR REBELS 
YOU AND THE SUDANESE 
GOVERNMENT ARE TOTALLY COMMITTED TO 
TALKING YOUR WAY THROUGH THE 
CONFLICT 
YES WE HAVE SHOWN THAT CONFLICT ALREADY WE HAVE HAD A HIGH LEVEL 
DELEGATION THERE HEADED BY THE 
SENIOR ADVISER OF THE PRESIDENT WE 
DECLARED UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE AND 
UNFORTUNATELY JEM DID NOT COME 
THEY BOYCOTTED THEY INFORMED THE 
MEDIATING TEAM THAT THEY ARE NOT 
WILLING TO NEGOTIATE I'M SURPRISED 
AT WHAT HE SAID THAT HE WANTS TO 
SUDAN TO TALK PEACE 
YOU ARE SAYING THE SUDANESE 
MILITARY WILL NOT BE CARRYING OUT 
ANY MORE BOMBARDMENTS ON JEM 
POSITIONS IN DARFUR BECAUSE YOU 
HAVE NOT STOPPED DOING THAT ONLY ONLY IF WE ARE ATTACKED IF WE ARE 
ATTACKED WE WILL DEFINITELY 
RETALIATE 
SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED RETALIATE THE ATTACK ON KHARTOUM DOES THAT 
MEAN WE CAN EXPECT MORE 
BOMBARDMENTS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DO 
THAT THE LIVES OF INNOCENT 
CIVILIANS ARE SACRIFICED IT 
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME THE THE AGGRESSION AGAINST THE CAPITAL HAS 
SAID HIS ALL IT WAS A VERY 
IRRESPONSIBLE AGGRESSION INSIDE THE 
CAPITAL TAKING MINERS AND CHILDREN 
WITH THEM 
THEY WOULDN'T SAY THAT 
WHILE KALIL IBRAHIM WENT FROM THE 
BATTLEFIELD HE LEFT BEHIND MANY 
CHILDREN IT IS VERY FORTUNATE 
UNFORTUNATE THAT JEM HAS BECOME ONE 
OF THREE ORGANS OF THE SECURITY 
APPARATUS 
THE AMBASSADOR TO THE APPARATUS UNITED NATIONS DENIES ANY 
INVOLVEMENT FROM CHAD OR 
INVOLVEMENT WITH JEM HUNDREDS OF 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED BY THE 
SUDANESE AUTHORITIES SUSPECTED OF 
BEING DARFURI REBELS ARE THEY 
GOING TO HAVE THEIR RIGHTS 
RESPECTED 
VERY MUCH RESPECTED RESPECTED NOBODY IS ARRESTED BECAUSE HE IS 
FROM DULL LET FIRST 
SERVICE SERVICE OR SPECIFIC REGION 
DARFUR 
WE BOMB AND CLEAN ANY 
REMAINING EVIDENCE THAT IS 
INDICATING TO US WHAT TO DO WE ARE 
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF 
THE PEOPLE NOBODY WILL BE HARMED 
BECAUSE OF HIS ETHNICITY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
TOMORROW GEORGE BUSH IS DUE TO 
ARRIVE IN ISRAEL FOR WHAT IS 
PROBABLY HIS LAST VISIT THERE AS 
PRESIDENT PART OF THE ROAD MAP FOR 
PEACE INVOLVES THE PALESTINIANS 
TAKING ON GREATER SECURITY 
RESPONSIBILITIES ON THE WEST BANK 
BUT ON THE GROUND IT IS CLEAR THAT 
ISRAELI ARMIES ARE STILL CONDUCTING 
EXTENSIVE OPERATIONS THERE WE 
GAINED EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO ONE 
ISRAELI ARMY UNIT AS IT CARRIED OUT 
A RAID 
TWO A M. AND A UNIT OF ISRAELI ARMY 
RESERVISTS ENTERS BETHLEHEM THEY 
HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE NAME OF A MAN 
SAID TO BE SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO 
PALESTINIAN MILITANTS IT IS THEIR 
JOB TO BRING HIM IN THESE 
RESERVISTS ARE CARRYING OUT ARREST 
MISSIONS LIKE THIS ALMOST EVERY 
SINGLE NIGHT THIS IS WHERE THE 
ISRAELIS EITHER DO NOT WANT OR DO 
NOT TRUST THE PALESTINIAN SECURITY 
FORCES TO CARRY OUT THESE ARRESTS 
ON THEIR OWN GOOD MORNING SAYS 
ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IT IS THE 
ISRAELI ARMY THE PALESTINIANS SAY 
IT IS PRECISELY OPERATIONS LIKE 
THESE WHICH STOP THEIR OWN SECURITY 
FORCES FROM TAKING CHARGE THE MEN 
ARE CALLED OUT AT GUNPOINT AND 
FORTUNATELY IT TURNS OUT IT IS THE 
WRONG HOUSE THE MEN ARE RELEASED 
AND THE SOLDIERS CONTINUE THEIR 
SEARCH MINUTES LATER THEY FIND 
THEIR TARGET I HAVE NO WEAPONS HE 
PLEADS SEARCH THE HOUSE PLEASE 
TAKE YOUR TIME SLEEPY CHILDREN ARE 
CALLED DOWN FROM THEIR BEDROOMS 
YOU'RE SCARING THEM THEIR 
GRANDMOTHER TELLS THE SOLDIERS 
THIS IS NOT RIGHT THE SOLDIERS 
ACTING ON A TIP FROM A SUSPECT IN 
CUSTODY EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE IS 
TURNED OVER THEY DON'T FIND ANY 
WEAPONS BUT THEY DECIDE TO TAKE 
HIM IN ANY WAY HIS FAMILY 
PROTESTED HIS INNOCENCE THE 
ISRAELI OFFICER IN CHARGE TELLS ME 
HE HAS YOUNG CHILDREN OF HIS OWN 
AND DOES NOT LIKE TO DO THIS WE 
TRY TO ACT AS GENTLY AS POSSIBLE 
WITHOUT SCREAMING SHOUTING AND 
AGGRESSION HE SAYS BUT IF WE 
DON'T FIND ILLEGAL WEAPONS THEY 
COULD BE USED TO KILL JEWS THE MAN 
WAS RELEASED LATER WE LEARN FROM 
HIS FAMILY THAT HE WAS IN FACT A 
PALESTINIAN POLICE OFFICER THE 
ISRAELIS HAD ARRESTED ONE OF THE 
MEN THEY WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO 
RELY ON TO MAINTAIN SECURITY HERE 
IT WAS A MEASURE OF HOW FAR THE TWO 
SIDES STILL HAVE TO GO BEFORE THEY 
CAN HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE IN EACH 
OTHER TO MAKE PEACE 
TALK OF CLIMATE CHANGE HAS FOCUSED 
MANY MINDS ON THE PROSPECT OF HOW 
MORE AND MORE COUNTRIES WILL SUFFER 
FROM WATER SHORTAGES IN THE THIRD 
FUTURE ONE OF THE MOST BADLY 
AFFECTED IN EUROPE IS SPAIN WHICH 
IS SUFFERING ITS WORST DROUGHT IN 
SIXTY YEARS SOME RESERVOIRS ARE LESS 
THAN TWENTY PER CENT FULL BARCELONA WITH A 
POPULATION OF MORE THAN FIVE MILLION 
HAS TAKEN THE UNPRECEDENTED STEP OF 
SHIPPING IN WATER SUPPLIES THE 
FIRST SHIPMENTS ARRIVE THIS MORNING 
MANY CLIMATE SCIENTISTS BELIEVE 
OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL HAVE 
TO DO THE SAME WHEN CLIMATE CHANGE 
TAKES HOLD 
AN ORDINARY VESSEL WITH AN 
INCREDIBLY PRECIOUS CARGO THIS WAS 
THE MOMENT THAT BARCELONA BECAME 
THE FIRST MAJOR EUROPEAN CITY TO 
HAVE A SHIP SUPPLY IT WITH WATER 
USUALLY IT IS OIL OR CONTAINERS 
THAT ARRIVE HERE BARCELONA FINDS 
ITSELF SO SHORT OF WATER THAT THIS 
WILL BE THE FIRST OF NEARLY TWO HUNDRED 
DELIVERIES ALL BECAUSE OF A 
DROUGHT THAT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE IT IT WAS A VERY DRY YEAR IN TERMS OF 
RAINFALL THIS DROUGHT CONTINUES 
AND TODAY WE ARE IN A VERY 
SERIOUS AND COMPLICATED SITUATION 
ACROSS BARCELONA THE IMPACT IS 
CLEAR THE FAMOUS FOUNTAINS HAVE 
BEEN STOPPED WATER RESTRICTIONS 
ARE IN PLACE FOUNTAIN NOZZLES ARE 
BONE DRY EVEN BEFORE THE FULL HEAT 
OF SUMMER PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO GET 
USED TO DRIER CONDITIONS WE 
TRAVELLED INTO THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE 
BARCELONA TO SEE THE SOURCE OF THE 
PROBLEM THIS KEY RESERVOIR IS A ZERO 
ALARMINGLY LOW YOU CAN SEE THE 
STRIDE OF BARE ROCK BELOW THE TREE 
LINE SHOWING JUST HOW MUCH THE 
WATER LEVEL HAS FALLEN THE 
RESERVOIR NOW HAS JUST EIGHTEEN PER CENT OF ITS 
NORMAL CAPACITY WHERE I AM 
STANDING RIGHT NOW SHOULD BE UNDER 
FORTY TO FIFTY METRES OF WATER BUT THIS 
IS SPAIN'S DRIEST YEAR ON RECORD 
WHAT IT MEANS HERE IS THAT THIS 
MEDIEVAL VILLAGE FLOODED FOR THE 
LAST FORTY YEARS IS NOW EXPOSED ONCE 
AGAIN THIS HAS BECOME A REALLY 
POTENT SYMBOL OF THE SEVERITY OF 
THE WATER CRISIS NOW GRIPPING SPAIN 
THE WATER IS STILL FLOWING THE 
PEOPLE OF AREA WHERE THEY MAY YET 
FACE THE THREAT OF RATIONING A. N. A. 
ROSA MARTINEZ AN ENVIRONMENTAL 
ACTIVIST IS AMONG THOSE WHO BLAME 
POLITICIANS FOR NOT TACKLING THE 
WATER SHORTAGE SOON ENOUGH SOME SOME PEOPLE SAY O. K. WE AS CITIZENS HAVE 
DONE ENOUGH NOW IT IS TIME FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT TO WORK PEOPLE FEEL O. K. 
THERE IS DROUGHT AND WE DO WHAT WE 
CAN WE ARE RESPONSIBLE BUT PLEASE 
DO YOUR WORK 
SO WHAT ABOUT 
BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON WATER 
THESE UNSOLD SWIMMING POOLS STAND 
LIKE TOMBSTONES SALES HAVE CRASHED 
BECAUSE POOLS CANNOT BE FILLED FROM 
NORMAL SUPPLIES THIS COULD REALLY 
DAMAGE TOURISM BACK AT THE PORT 
INSPECTORS HAD ON BOARD TO TEST THE 
WATER THIS EXTRAORDINARY OPERATION 
IS MEANT TO FILL A GAP UNTIL A NEW 
PIPELINE IS BUILT BUT WITH 
SCIENTISTS FORECASTING EVEN DRIER 
CONDITIONS THE ARRIVAL OF THE SHIP 
REVEALS HOW RADICALLY EVEN THE MOST 
PROSPEROUS CITIES MAY HAVE TO ADAPT 
WE ARE JOINED BY A 
FROM IT IS A COMBINATION OF 
DIFFERENT THINGS 
WHAT WE HEARD 
HERE IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A 
NUMBER OF YEARS WHEN THE RAINFALL 
HAS BEEN BELOW AVERAGE THAT MEANS 
THAT THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT IS 
BEING COLLECTED IN RESERVOIRS AND 
IN DIFFERENT STORAGE CONTAINERS IN 
THE COUNTRY WILL HAVE GONE DOWN 
THAT IS ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING 
PART OF THE CLIMATE CHANGED 
SITUATION THAT IS SOMETHING THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS HARDLY ANYTHING 
TO DO WITH IN THE SHORT TERM BUT BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER 
PREPARED SURELY 
YES BUT I THINK 
WHAT WE SEE NOW IN SPAIN IT IS 
ALSO THAT THEY USE AND SOCIETY HAS 
INCREASED QUITE DRAMATICALLY NOT 
ONLY IN SPAIN BUT ALL OVER THE 
WORLD WE SEE QUITE A STRONG 
INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR WATER 
ESPECIALLY FOR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD 
PRODUCTION PRESUMABLY HERE IN 
SPAIN THEY USED BOTH FOR FOOD 
SUPPLY TO THE CITIES THE 
HOUSEHOLDS AND INDUSTRY BUT TO A 
VERY LARGE EXTENT ALSO FOR 
AGRICULTURE AND FOOD PRODUCTION 
THAT IS WHERE THE MAIN PART OF THE 
WATER GOES THE WATER THAT IS 
CHANNELLED OR IS SUPPLIED WILL 
EVAPORATE THEN WE ARE LOSING WATER 
DO YOU THINK WE NEED SOME KIND OF 
GLOBAL WATER MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL 
GUIDELINES OR SOMETHING AS PART OF 
THE CLIMATE CHANGE FRAMEWORK THE THE 
WELL A NUMBER OF EFFORTS ARE GOING 
ON WE ARE RIGHT NOW AT NEW YORK IN 
THE COMMISSION FOR SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT DISCUSSING DIFFERENT 
METHODS FOR ANSWERING THE CHALLENGE 
I THINK WHAT WE SEE IN EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES AS WELL AS IN ASIAN 
COUNTRIES AND AFRICAN COUNTRIES IS 
THERE MUST BE EFFORTS TO MAKE A 
MORE PRODUCTIVE USE OF THE WATER 
WE MUST SAVE THE WATER WE MUST 
NEED TO USE THE WATER PRUDENTLY 
AND AGRICULTURE IF WE DON'T THERE 
WILL BE A TREMENDOUS WATER PROBLEM 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT 
MESSAGE MESSAGE A QUICK REMINDER OF OUR TOP STORY 
NEARLY TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE NOW 
CONFIRMED DEAD IN THE CHINESE 
EARTHQUAKE EARTHQUAKE THAT IS ALL FROM THE PROGRAMME 
NEXT ON B. B. C. FOR IT IS THE WEATHER 
B. B. C. FOR 
GOOD EVENING THE CLOUD WILL 
INCREASE FOR MANY OF US OVERNIGHT 
GENERALLY A PRETTY GREY START BUT 
TOMORROW THAT CLOUD SHOULD 
DISAPPEAR AND IT SHOULD GENERALLY 
BE A FINE AND SUNNY DAY WE HAVE AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE SITTING TO THE 
SOUTH THAT WILL BE CHANGING LATER 
IN THE WEEK FOR THE TIME BEING WE 
HAVE HIGH PRESSURE CONTROLLING 
THINGS WE WILL SEE A LOT OF HARD 
FIRST THING BUT IT WILL TEND TO 
MELT AWAY EXCEPT IN THE FAR EAST 
ALONG THE NORTH SEA COAST MUCH 
MORE CLOUD FOR THE NORTHERN ISLES 
ACROSS SCOTLAND THERE WILL BE SOME 
SUNSHINE ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT 
COOLER WITH A RISK OF FOG ON THE 
SOUTH EAST COAST A LOT OF LOW 
CLOUD LIKE TODAY IT WILL BE 
CALLED ON THE COAST IN THE 
MIDLANDS WE WILL SEE SOME AFTERNOON 
SUNSHINE THERE IS THE LIKELIHOOD 
OF A FEW SHOWERS DOTTED AROUND BY 
THE END OF THE AFTERNOON AND INTO 
THE EVENING ONE OR TWO OF THEIR 
SHOWERS COULD BE ON THE HEAVY SIDE 
NOT TOO MANY SHOWERS FOR WALES A 
FINE AND SUNNY DAY IT LOOKS PRETTY 
SUNNY TOMORROW FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
AS WELL MORE CHANGES TAKING PLACE 
AS THE WEEK GOES ON THIS AREA OF 
LOW PRESSURE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER 
THE WEATHER FRONT WILL BRING A LOT 
OF CLOUD ON THURSDAY ACROSS 
SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND AND 
WALES WITH SOME HEAVY SHOWERY 
OUTBREAKS OF RAIN IT COULD BE 
QUITE CLOUDY ON SOME OF THE NORTH 
EAST COASTS WE WILL HAVE SOME 
SUNSHINE ACROSS THE NORTH WESTERN 
CORNER OF THE UNITED
