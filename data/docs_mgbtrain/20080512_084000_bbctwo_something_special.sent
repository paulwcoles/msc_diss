RAILWAY LINES 
OH HELLO THERE 
OH DEAR I'M NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER YOU KNOW 
ALL THESE STEPS MAKE ME PUFF OH 
STILL I'M NEARLY AT THE TOP NOW 
OH DEAR 
AH THAT'S IT NOW YOU CAN SEE WHERE I AM I'M ON A RAILWAY BRIDGE 
THERE SHOULD BE A TRAIN ALONG ANY MINUTE 
OH LOOK THERE IT IS NOW DOESN'T IT GO FAST 
AND MAKE A LOT OF NOISE EH 
TRAINS ARE BIG AND POWERFUL THINGS IF YOU GET CLOSE TO THEM 
THE RUNAWAY TRAIN CAME DOWN THE TRACK AND SHE BLEW WOO WOO 
THE RUNAWAY TRAIN CAME DOWN THE TRACK AND SHE BLEW STOP WHY 
I ONLY DID ONE WOO WOO I'VE HAD THE BEST IDEA 
NOT AGAIN NO LISTEN MILO 
INSTEAD OF THAT ONE WHY DON'T WE MAKE UP A TRAIN SONG OF OUR OWN 
YEAH WHY 
MAX IS SHOWING US HOW TO BE SAFE BY THE RAILWAY 
SO OUR SONG COULD BE ALL ABOUT WHAT HE TELLS US OH 
NOW HERE WE ARE BESIDE THE RAILWAY TRACK 
THIS FENCE IS HERE FOR A REASON TO KEEP PEOPLE OFF THE TRACK 
PROMISE ME YOU WILL NEVER EVER GO ON THE RAILWAY TRACK 
NOT TO GET YOUR BALL BACK OR FOR A SHORT CUT OR EVEN FOR A GAME 
IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE 
OH IF YOU WERE ON THE TRACK AND THE TRAIN CAME BY AS FAST AS THAT 
YOU'D NOT HAVE TIME TO SEE IT AND THE TRAIN WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO STOP 
SO WHAT HAVE YOU GOT SO FAR 
NEVER GO ON THE RAILWAY LINE 
TRAINS ARE COMING ALL THE TIME THAT'S GOOD FIZZ 
SPEEDING ALONG FROM TOWN TO TOWN 
YOU WON'T SEE 'EM COMING AND THEY'LL KNOCK YOU DOWN BRILLIANT 
THANK YOU I THANK YOU 
NOW SOMETIMES WE DO NEED TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RAILWAY 
SO LET'S SEE WHERE YOU CAN CROSS THE TRACK SAFELY THERE'S A BRIDGE 
LIKE THE ONE I USED 
THERE'S A LEVEL CROSSING BUT YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL HERE 
BECAUSE CARS USE IT TOO 
AND IN SOME PLACES 
THERE'S A SPECIAL TUNNEL CALLED AN UNDERPASS 
THERE'LL BE ANOTHER TRAIN ALONG SOON 
BUT REMEMBER TO ALWAYS USE THE PROPER CROSSINGS AT A RAILWAY LINE 
AND ABOVE ALL STAY OFF THE TRACK 
YES THAT'LL SOUND GOOD 
FIZZ WE'VE FINISHED THE SONG CAN I HEAR IT PLEASE JUDY CERTAINLY 
CROSS THE TRACK IN THE PROPER P. L. A. E. 
USING A BRIDGE IS REALLY ACE 
A CROSSING TOO BUT MIND THE CARS AND DON'T FORGET 
THE UNDERPASS 
WOO WOO OH THAT'S GREAT JUDY FAB AROONI 
IT'S FUN TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS EVERY DAY 
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT LAST FOREVER 
BUT KEEP IN YOUR HEAD WHAT THE TWEENIES SAID 
THEN WE'LL ALL PLAY SAFE TOGETHER 
YES WE'LL ALL PLAY SAFE TOGETHER 
CLICKETY CLACK CLICKETY CLACK 
TRAINS ALONG THE RAILWAY TRACK 
CLICKETY CLACK CLICKETY CLACK 
STAY SAFE BY THE RAILWAY TRACK 
USE THE RIGHT PLACE TO GO OVER THE LINE 
BRIDGE OR CROSSING BOTH ARE JUST FINE 
THOSE TRAINS GO FAST FROM TOWN TO TOWN 
SO KEEP OFF THE TRACK YOU CAN GET KNOCKED DOWN 
WE'LL ALL PLAY SAFE TOGETHER 
OH DEAR IGGLEPIGGLE HAS GONE THE WRONG WAY 
THE NIGHT IS BLACK 
AND THE STARS ARE BRIGHT
