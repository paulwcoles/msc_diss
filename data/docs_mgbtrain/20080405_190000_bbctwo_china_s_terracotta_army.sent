THE BUZZ AROUND THE BRITISH MUSEUM HAS REACHED FEVER PITCH 
AS IT OPENS ITS BIGGEST EXHIBITION IN A GENERATION 
IT'S ABOUT THE FIRST EMPEROR OF CHINA ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MEN 
WHO HAS EVER LIVED AND CREATOR OF THE TERRACOTTA ARMY 
WE'VE HAD EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO THE EXHIBITION TEAM 
FROM THE EARLIEST PLANNING STAGES 
RIGHT THROUGH UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE PREPARATIONS FOR OPENING 
RIGHT NICE AND EASY IF YOU JUST GET A HAND ON THE WARRIOR 
YOUR FIRST SIGHT OF THEM HAS TO BE DROP DEAD THAT MOMENT 
IT HAS TO HIT YOU EMOTIONALLY 
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MUSEUM'S HISTORIC READING ROOM HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO A GALLERY 
THE ROOM IS STILL A STAR IT'S STILL EXPRESSED WITHIN THE EXHIBITION 
ON DISPLAY WILL BE SOME TRULY ICONIC OBJECTS 
HE'S THE UNARMOURED GENERAL ISN'T HE YEAH 
IT'S AMAZING ISN'T IT THEY LOOK SO REAL 
IT'S THE JOB OF A LIFETIME FOR THE CURATOR 
THIS EXHIBITION'S THE BIGGEST ONE I'VE EVER DONE 
I'VE DONE PERMANENT GALLERIES I'VE DONE TEMPORARY EXHIBITIONS BUT THIS IS THE BIGGEST 
HER CHALLENGE IS TO TELL AN EPIC STORY 
THE CREATION OF AN EMPIRE THE BUILDING OF A GREAT WALL 
THE UNIFICATION OF A PEOPLE 
THE FIRST EMPEROR RULED CHINA FOR ELEVEN YEARS AND BUILT A LAVISH TOMB TO INHABIT FOR EVER 
THE OBJECTS WHICH THE BRITISH MUSEUM IS GATHERING TOGETHER WILL TELL 
THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO MADE CHINA AND HIS SPECTACULAR ETERNAL ARMY 
GOD THAT'S BREATHTAKING 
THE WOMAN IN CHARGE OF THE FIRST EMPEROR PROJECT IS JANE PORTAL 
THIS GALLERY'S ENORMOUS 
IT'S THE BIGGEST GALLERY IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM 
JANE IS THE CURATOR OF ONE OF THE BEST COLLECTIONS OF 
THE CHINESE BRONZES JADES AND CERAMICS IN THE WEST 
BUT THE FIRST EMPEROR'S DYNASTY THE QIN IS A LITTLE UNDER REPRESENTED 
I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT THERE IS IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM WHICH IS FROM THE QIN WHICH IS HERE 
WE ONLY HAVE THESE THREE OBJECTS 
THIS IS IT THIS IS IT YES 
SO NO WONDER YOU'RE GETTING EXCITED ABOUT THE QIN EXHIBITION 
AND IN FACT THE QIN EXHIBITION WE'RE HAVING A LARGE MAJORITY OF 
EVERYTHING THERE IS TO DO WITH THE QIN IS GOING TO BE IN OUR EXHIBITION 
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH TO DO WITH THE QIN APART FROM THE EVIDENCE FROM THE FIRST EMPEROR'S TOMB 
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THE EVIDENCE FROM THE TOMB 
OBJECTS FROM THE FIRST EMPEROR'S TOMB INCLUDING TERRACOTTA WARRIORS 
ARE BEING BROUGHT ACROSS THE WORLD FROM XI'AN IN CENTRAL CHINA 
THIS THRIVING CITY WAS ONCE A GREAT CAPITAL OF THE ANCIENT WORLD LIKE ATHENS CAIRO AND ROME 
TODAY TWO MILLION PEOPLE COME HERE EACH YEAR TO VISIT THE TERRACOTTA WARRIORS MUSEUM 
THE TERRACOTTA WARRIORS THAT WERE EXCAVATED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR ARE REALLY THE MOST 
SPECTACULAR ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND IN THE WORLD 
IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIX AFTER A YEAR OF NEGOTIATION 
JANE VISITED XI'AN TO SELECT THE ITEMS SHE WANTED FOR HER EXHIBITION 
SHE CAME WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM NEIL MACGREGOR 
WHAT IS SO EXTRAORDINARY IS THAT THIS WAS AN ARMY READY TO 
WELL ACTUALLY ON THE MARCH 
THEY WERE HOPING TO SECURE TWENTY FIGURES MORE THAN HAD EVER BEEN LOANED BEFORE 
THE DESIGN CHALLENGE IS HOW YOU GET SOME IDEA TO THE VISITOR IN LONDON OF THE SCALE OF THE SITE 
IF THEIR EXHIBITION CAN'T CONVEY THE SHEER SIZE OF THE ARMY 
IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE VISITORS A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE 
A FACE TO FACE ENCOUNTER WITH INDIVIDUAL WARRIORS SOMETHING WHICH IS ONLY POSSIBLE FOR V. I. P.'S IN CHINA 
WHAT'S SO EXTRAORDINARY IS TO BE ABLE TO LOOK THEM IN THE EYE ISN'T IT 
AND I THINK TO GIVE THE VISITOR THE SENSE OF HOW BIG THEY ARE 
AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO IN THE EXHIBITION WHICH IS NOT REALLY POSSIBLE FOR THE VISITOR HERE 
THE EXHIBITION IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE TERRACOTTA ARMY 
IT'S ABOUT THE FIRST EMPEROR HIMSELF AND THE QIN DYNASTY 
THE QIN RULED THE MOST WESTERLY OF SEVERAL WARRING STATES FOR OVER 
SIX HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THEY CONQUERED THE OTHERS AND UNITED CHINA 
WITH DESIGNER CAROLINE INGHAM JANE EMBARKED ON A NINE HUNDRED MILE JOURNEY 
AROUND THE ANCIENT QIN STATE SEARCHING FOR OBJECTS TO DISPLAY 
ALTHOUGH THE QIN WAS MAINLY KNOWN FOR ITS MILITARY ABILITIES 
WE'RE TRYING TO GET OVER THE FACT THAT THEY ACTUALLY MADE BEAUTIFUL THINGS AS WELL 
I HAVE SEEN PICTURES OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY FAMOUS AND THEY ARE INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE 
BUT THIS WILL BE A SHOW WHICH IS ABOUT FAR MORE THAN A COLLECTION OF OBJECTS 
IT COMES AT A TIME WHEN THE WEST IS TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THE RISE OF MODERN CHINA 
THAT IS OF COURSE EXACTLY WHAT THE BRITISH MUSEUM IS ABOUT 
THE POINT WAS ALWAYS THAT IF YOU THOUGHT CAREFULLY ABOUT THE PAST 
YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE PRESENT 
THIS EXHIBITION ALLOWS US TO TRY TO DO 
SOMETHING WE REALLY HAVEN'T DONE BEFORE 
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANT TO MAKE CHINA 
AND HOW IT CAME THAT ONE MAN WAS ABLE TO CREATE 
WHAT IS THE OLDEST POLITICAL ENTITY IN THE WORLD 
EVERY MORNING THIS FLAG IS RAISED IN THE HEART OF THE CAPITAL HERE IN BEIJING 
IT SYMBOLISES ONE UNITED COUNTRY AND A PRETTY POWERFUL ONE AT THAT 
IT COULD ALL HAVE BEEN SO DIFFERENT IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FIRST EMPEROR TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
WHO TOOK SEVEN SEPARATE KINGDOMS AND CREATED ONE STATE 
THE FIRST EMPEROR SET THE TEMPLATE FOR MODERN CHINA 
HE CENTRALISED RULE ACROSS HIS VAST EMPIRE 
WITH RUTHLESS ORGANISATION BACKED BY MILITARY MIGHT 
HE CREATED AN EVERLASTING VERSION OF HIS VICTORIOUS ARMY 
SEVEN THOUSAND TERRACOTTA WARRIORS GUARD HIS TOMB READY TO SPRING INTO ACTION AGAINST THE GHOST OF HIS ENEMIES 
IN HIS SHORT REIGN OF ELEVEN YEARS THE FIRST EMPEROR CREATED 
A COHERENT SOCIETY WITH STRICT LAWS GOVERNING EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE 
COULD I HAVE SOME MUSHROOMS 
STANDARD UNITS OF WEIGHT AND MEASUREMENT MEANT THAT BUSINESS 
COULD BE DONE FAIRLY ACROSS THE EMPIRE WITH A NEW SINGLE CURRENCY 
HE BUILT ROADS LINKING THE FORMER WARRING STATES AND FIXED THE WIDTH 
OF CART AXLES SO THE RUTS ON THOSE ROADS WOULD BE UNIFORM 
FAMOUSLY HE SECURED HIS EMPIRE FROM BARBARIAN ATTACK WITH A GREAT WALL TO THE NORTH A WALL 
RE ROUTED AND REBUILT BY SUCCESSIVE EMPERORS OVER THE NEXT TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
HOW ON EARTH DO YOU DO JUSTICE TO ALL THIS IN JUST ONE EXHIBITION 
THE QUESTION YOU WANT TO ASK IS HOW DID HE DO IT 
THIS IS WHY WE'RE HOPING TO USE THIS STEELY IDEA 
MANY PEOPLE ARE PLANNING THE EXHIBITION BUT IT'S 
JANE WHO HAS TO WORK OUT HOW TO TELL THE FIRST EMPEROR'S STORY 
HOW OR WHERE IN ALL THIS CAN WE TRY TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF WHAT HE ACTUALLY BELIEVED 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY RELATED TO 
AN EXTREMELY COMPLEX BELIEF STRUCTURE OF HIM AFTER DEATH 
DO WE KNOW WHAT THAT WAS 
IT'S NOT LIKE EGYPT WHERE THERE'S THE BOOK OF THE DEAD TELLING YOU WHAT HAPPENS TO THE DEAD SPIRIT 
THE ONLY EVIDENCE WE HAVE IS THE SHUJING WHICH IS THE BOOK OF HISTORY WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN THE HAN DYNASTY 
THE FOLLOWING DYNASTY AND IT'S WRITTEN BY THIS CONFUCIAN HISTORIAN 
AND HE DESCRIBES THE MAKING OF THE TOMB 
WE'VE GOT NO IDEA WHETHER THE EMPEROR IS WAITING FOR JUDGMENT OR WHATEVER 
AS FAR AS WE KNOW HE'S JUST GOING ON DOING FOR EVER WHAT HE WAS DOING 
SO THIS IS THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD GOING ON INDEFINITELY RATHER THAN 
AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE A DIFFERENT KIND OF WORLD 
WE MAY NEVER KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE FIRST EMPEROR BELIEVED ABOUT LIFE AFTER DEATH 
DESPITE THE WEALTH OF MATERIAL FOUND AROUND HIS FINAL RESTING PLACE 
LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF THE TERRACOTTA ARMY BUT FEW REALISE 
THEY'RE ACTUALLY JUST A SMALL PART OF A GIANT NECROPOLIS A KIND OF PALACE OF THE DEAD BUILT 
BY QIN SHIHUANGDI FOR HIMSELF AND IN THE MIDDLE THERE IS THIS VERY PROMINENT TOMB MOUND 
THE TERRACOTTA ARMY ARE ACTUALLY ABOUT A KILOMETRE AND A HALF TO THE EAST OVER THERE AND 
ALL OVER THIS AREA THERE ARE PITS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND FULL OF OTHER FIGURES ANIMALS AND PRECIOUS GOODS 
THE CHINESE PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THEIR FIRST EMPEROR WAS BURIED HERE 
BUT THERE WAS NO RECORD OF THE TERRACOTTA ARMY 
IT WAS DISCOVERED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WHEN A PEASANT DIGGING A WELL SAW A POTTERY HEAD LOOKING UP AT HIM 
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT BEGAN EXCAVATING 
BRINGING IN WORKERS FROM A LOCAL COMMUNE AND CAPTURED IT ON FILM 
THE FIRST WARRIORS WENT ON DISPLAY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE 
THIS MODEL THIRD CENTURY B. C. ARMY IS IN BATTLE FORMATION 
THERE ARE COLUMNS OF INFANTRY IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF BATTLEDRESS 
AND TEAMS DRIVING WOODEN CHARIOTS WHICH HAVE LONG SINCE ROTTED AWAY EACH DRAWN BY FOUR HORSES 
THESE ARE THE FACES OF PEOPLE THAT LIVED LOVED AND FOUGHT OVER TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
AND THEY'RE ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONLY QIN STATUES IN EXISTENCE 
ONLY ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT OF THE PIT HAS BEEN EXCAVATED 
THE COLUMNS STRETCH BACK MUCH FURTHER WITH THOUSANDS MORE TERRACOTTA WARRIORS STILL BURIED 
AND THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE STORY 
CLOSE BY IS ANOTHER SMALLER PIT 
HERE PARTIALLY EXCAVATED ARE ARCHERS AND CAVALRY AND MORE INFANTRY TO SUPPORT THE MAIN ARMY 
AND THERE'S A THIRD PIT A COMMAND POST FOR THE ARMY WITH HIGH RANKING OFFICERS 
THERE WAS ALSO AN ORNATE CANOPIED CHARIOT WHICH HAS DISINTEGRATED WITH CHARIOTEERS HOLDING THE REINS 
WHEN YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO MAKE HISTORY PROGRAMMES YOU COME TO A HUGE NUMBER OF PLACES AND SEE 
ALL SORTS OF AMAZING THINGS AND OFTEN YOU HAVE TO GET TERRIBLY EXCITED ABOUT THEM BUT HERE 
TODAY AT THE TERRACOTTA ARMY I'VE BEEN COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED 
THIS IS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING I'VE EVER SEEN 
THE EXHIBITION IS TO BE HELD IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM'S HISTORIC READING ROOM 
NOW A PUBLIC LIBRARY IT WAS ONCE THE PRESERVE OF SCHOLARS THE ENGINE ROOM OF BRITISH INTELLECTUAL LIFE 
CHINESE VISITORS WANT TO KNOW WHERE KARL MARX SAT WHEN HE WROTE DAS KAPITAL HERE 
IT'S A MARVELLOUS TOMB LIKE SPACE BUT CONVERTING IT HAS BEEN CONTROVERSIAL 
THE BOOKS WILL MOVE AND A MODERN GALLERY IS TO BE INSERTED INTO THIS GRADE I LISTED BUILDING 
HEAD OF EXHIBITIONS CAROLYN MARSDEN SMITH HAS COMMISSIONED THE EXHIBITION DESIGNERS 
IT'S CERTAINLY A CHALLENGE AND IT'S SOMETHING WE WANTED THE DESIGNERS TO TAKE HEAD ON 
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT SPACE TO THE KIND OF SPACES THAT WE WOULD NORMALLY PRESENT AN EXHIBITION IN 
IT'S A UNIQUE HISTORIC INTERIOR SO IT HAS A REAL PERSONALITY OF ITS OWN 
THE MUSEUM DOESN'T WANT TO HIDE THAT PERSONALITY IT WANTS TO SHOW IT OFF 
AS WELL AS HAVING THIS EXTRAORDINARY EXHIBITION IN THE SPACE 
SO THAT IS A VERY UNIQUE BRIEF FOR THE DESIGNERS 
STEPHEN GREENBERG'S DESIGN COMPANY METAPHOR HAS WON THE COMMISSION 
WE HAVE AN ARCHER THE TOP OF THE STAIRS AT THE BEGINNING WE HAVE THE OTHER ARCHER 
AT THE END THE PAINTED ONE AND THERE'S A LOVELY SYMMETRY OF 
YOU ARRIVE YOU SEE THE HEAD OF ARCHER AND YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE LEAVING 
AND PEOPLE TURNING BACK DOWN THE STAIRS AND YOU KNOW 
SO YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE HIM FROM THE SIDE INTO THE MIDDLE 
AT THE MOMENT HE'S THERE JANE WHICH IS NICE BECAUSE HE'S FACING OUT 
THAT AN IMPROVEMENT ON HOW WE HAD THAT LAS T. WE E. K. 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT HIM AS YOU GO OUT WHICH IS REALLY NICE 
THE KEY THING IS THE DISPLAY OF THE TERRACOTTA FIGURES 
THE IDEA OF ALLOWING VISITORS TO LOOK THE TERRACOTTA WARRIORS 
IN THE EYE HAS NOW BECOME INTEGRAL TO THE DESIGN 
WHAT DO I SEE AS THE BIG WOW 
IT'S NOT THE FIRST WOW IN THE SHOW BUT IT IS THE WOW OF WOWS 
DARE I SAY IT MAYBE YOU EVEN WALK ON THE EXHIBITION SURFACE 
IF YOU WALK ON THE SAME SURFACE AS THE OBJECT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
THAT CHANGES YOU'RE ON THE SURFACE 
THE ONE TIME YOU STEP ON THE SAME SURFACE 
THEN YOU'RE REALLY IN AMONGST THEM WHICH IS WHAT WE WANTED ALL ALONG 
IN AMONGST THEM YEAH 
BECAUSE THE SPACE IS FORTY METRES ACROSS AND IT'S SUCH A STRONG SPACE 
YOU'VE GOT TO DO THINGS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY NOTICE IN THE SPACE 
YOU HAVE TO START WITH THIS 
YOU HAVE TO START WITH THIS GREAT BIG THING 
SO IF WE PEEL THE DOME OFF 
THE EXHIBITION IS DIVIDED INTO TWO HALVES WITH THIS PIECE UP THE MIDDLE THE MONOLITH PIECE 
THIS HALF IS ALL ABOUT HIS LIFE AND WORKS AND ACHIEVEMENTS AND THE OTHER HALF IS ALL ABOUT HIS ETERNAL LIFE 
EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN FOUND IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG AND PITS 
WHAT A MARVELLOUS CHALLENGE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE AN EXHIBITION 
IN A SPACE LIKE THIS TO DO SUCH A GREAT STORY 
I MEAN IT'S A ONCE IN A LIFETIME PROJECT 
THIS IS THE STEP OF INNER MONGOLIA THE NORTHERN BORDER OF THE ANCIENT STATE OF QIN 
THE LAND STILL PROBABLY LOOKS AS IT DID IN THE DAYS WHEN NOMADIC WARRIORS SWEPT TO AND FRO 
THE FIRST EMPEROR IMPOSED ORDER BY BUILDING THE MOST FAMOUS NATIONAL BOUNDARY IN THE WORLD 
THIS IS PART OF THE ORIGINAL GREAT WALL OF CHINA 
IT'S MADE OUT OF COMPRESSED EARTH AND IT'S OVER TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD 
IT'S NOT LIKE THE BIT OF THE GREAT WALL THAT ALL THE TOURISTS ARE TAKEN TO 
THAT WAS REBUILT OVER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THIS ONE 
THE ORIGINAL GREAT WALL WAS BUILT DURING THE REIGN OF QIN SHIHUANGDI 
HE WANTED TO JOIN TOGETHER LOTS OF LITTLE WALLS TO CREATE ONE MASSIVE 
DEFENSIVE BARRIER TO PROTECT HIS NEW EMPIRE THERE TO THE SOUTH AGAINST THE BARBARIAN TRIBES OF THE NORTH 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DIED BUILDING THE WALL 
SOME CALL IT THE WORLD'S LONGEST CEMETERY 
BEFORE BECOMING EMPEROR HE RULED THESE LANDS FOR A QUARTER 
OF THE CENTURY AS THE KING OF QIN FROM THE AGE OF THIRTEEN 
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NO CONTEMPORARY IMAGES OF THE YOUNG KING OF QIN SO WE DON'T 
REALLY KNOW WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE BUT ONE OF HIS ENEMIES SAID THAT HE HAD A WASPISH NOSE AND ELONGATED EYES 
HE ALSO HAD THE VOICE OF A JACKAL AND THE HEART OF A WOLF OR A TIGER 
HE GOVERNED FOR A SOPHISTICATED BUREAUCRACY PROMOTION WAS ON MERIT 
REJECTING THE GENTLER TRADITIONS OF CONFUCIUS HE METED OUT HARSH PUNISHMENTS FOR LAW BREAKERS 
BEING CUT IN HALF BEHEADED OR PULLED APART BY HORSES 
THE KING WAS AMBITIOUS TO EXPAND HIS TERRITORY 
AFTER A DECADE OF ALLIANCES BRIBES AND BATTLES 
HE CONQUERED THE OTHER SIX STATES TO FORM ONE UNITED COUNTRY IN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE B. C. 
THE BARBARIANS BEYOND THE GREAT WALL WOULD HEAR OF THE EMPIRE OF QIN AND CALL IT CHINA 
STANDING UP HERE ON THE NORTHERN FRONTIER OF THIS NEW EMPIRE 
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY TO THINK THAT IT EXTENDS FROM THESE FROZEN LANDS HERE 
HERE RIGHT THE WAY DOWN TO THE WARM TROPICAL WATERS OF THE SOUTH CHINA SEA 
IT REALLY RIVALS ANYTHING ACHIEVED BY NAPOLEON OR ALEXANDER 
HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF DIVINE A LIVING GOD 
HE CALLED HIMSELF QIN SHIHUANGDI THE FIRST AUGUST EMPEROR OF QIN 
NAMES AND TITLES MATTER 
THE BRITISH MUSEUM HAS A TEAM DEDICATED TO MAKING THE EXHIBITION TEXT CLEAR TO THE VISITOR 
CATHERINE COOPER AND JANE MUST DECIDE HOW BEST TO REFER TO THE EMPEROR 
I MEAN THE TITLE IS QUITE A DIFFICULT THING TO GET OVER BECAUSE QIN SHIHUANGDI 
QIN IS THE QIN STATE SHI IS NUMBER ONE FIRST 
HUANGDI MEANS SORT OF AUGUST OR DIVINE EMPEROR 
I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE NEED TO PUT IN AUGUST AND DIVINE THAT'S THE THING 
RIGHT WHETHER WE CAN JUST CHOOSE DIVINE THAT WOULD BE NICER FOR US 
I'D BETTER CHECK WITH VARIOUS OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S QUITE A MAJOR THING 
BECAUSE HE'S USUALLY CALLED FIRST AUGUST EMPEROR OF THE QIN 
AUGUST IS A BIT OF A WEIRD WORD 
A VISITOR WHO DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH AS A FIRST LANGUAGE WON'T KNOW THAT WORD WILL THEY 
BUT WHO'S THIS AIMED AT IS IT AIMED AT EVERYBODY OR IS IT AIMED AT PEOPLE WHO DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH PROPERLY 
WELL IT'S AIMED AT EVERYBODY ISN'T IT WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE TRICKY THINGS 
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT AND SEE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK 
IT IS RATHER IMPORTANT THIS 
I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW THAT'S WHY I DON'T WANT TO 
IT'S PRACTICALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WHOLE EXHIBITION WHAT HE WAS CALLED AND WHY 
FOR THE ANCIENT CHINESE THERE WAS NOTHING WORTH HAVING BEYOND CHINA JUST INFERIOR LANDS AND BARBARIANS 
SO THE FIRST EMPEROR BELIEVED THAT HE RULED ALL OF CIVILISATION 
HAVING CONQUERED THE KNOWN WORLD QIN SHIHUANGDI MADE A SERIES OF TOURS AROUND HIS VAST NEW EMPIRE 
HE VISITED ALL OF CHINA'S SACRED MOUNTAINS IN PARTICULAR THIS ONE TAISHAN THE MOST IMPORTANT 
HERE FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE MYTHICAL LEADERS OF THE PAST HE ASCENDED TO WORSHIP AND 
TALK TO THE GODS AND ABOVE ALL STAKE HIS CLAIM TO IMMORTALITY 
THE MOUNTAIN WAS SACRED NOT JUST BECAUSE IT BROUGHT THE FIRST EMPEROR 
CLOSER TO THE HEAVENS HE WORSHIPPED IT AS A GOD IN ITS OWN RIGHT 
TODAY IT'S STILL A PLACE OF PILGRIMAGE FOR DAOISTS AND BUDDHISTS 
THE FIRST EMPEROR'S CLAIM TO BE A GOD DID NOT MAKE HIM UNIVERSALLY POPULAR 
AND SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE MADE ON HIS LIFE 
INCREASINGLY PARANOID HE DECREED THAT ANYONE 
WHO REVEALED HIS WHEREABOUTS WOULD BE SENTENCED TO DEATH 
THE FIRST EMPEROR ONCE EVEN PUNISHED A MOUNTAIN ORDERING ALL ITS TREES TO BE CUT DOWN 
BUT HE WAS RESPECTFUL TO TAISHAN PUTTING LEAVES ON HIS CARRIAGE WHEELS TO PROTECT IT 
TODAY THE MOUNTAIN IS STILL CHERISHED WITH CAREFUL LANDSCAPING 
BUT IN CHINA THERE'S STILL ONLY ONE WAY TO MOVE A TREE UP A MOUNTAIN 
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY IT'S LIKE NOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE THE QIN DYNASTY 
LOTS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET THIS TREE UP TO THE SUMMIT 
REALLY I SUPPOSE REMINISCENT OF THE ENTOURAGE OF QIN SHIHUANGDI GETTING 
ALL HIS POSSESSIONS UP HERE FOR THE CEREMONY AT THE SUMMIT 
UP HERE ON THE SUMMIT OF TAISHAN YOU COME ACROSS THESE EXTRAORDINARY CARVINGS 
MADE BY SUBSEQUENT EMPERORS DETAILING RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES 
THIS TRADITION WAS BEGUN BY QIN SHIHUANGDI 
HE CAME UP HERE AND CARVED HIS LEGACY INTO THE SCENERY 
HIS CARVINGS WHICH ALAS DON'T REMAIN ALTHOUGH COPIES WERE MADE 
SAY HOW NONE COME TO HIM EXCEPT IN SUBMISSION AND WHAT A GOOD GOVERNOR HE IS 
AND IT SAYS THAT HIS INFLUENCE WILL BE UNENDING 
HIS UNENDING INFLUENCE CAN BE SEEN IN THE WRITTEN SCRIPT 
PEOPLE ACROSS CHINA OFTEN CAN'T UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER WHEN THEY SPEAK 
BUT THERE'S NO CONFUSION WHEN THEY WRITE THANKS TO THE FIRST EMPEROR 
HE IMPOSED ONE SET OF CHARACTERS ACROSS HIS EMPIRE 
PROBABLY DON'T WANT SOMETHING AS BORING AS THE CHINESE 
VERSION OF TIMES NEW ROMAN OR COURIER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
PART OF THE EXHIBITION TEXT WILL BE IN CHINESE 
BUT CHOOSING THE FONT IS NOT EASY 
THIS LOOKS LIKE QUITE CONTEMPORARY 
H. M. M. I DON'T LIKE IT NO SO WE'RE ON THIS PAGE 
WHEN WE STARTED THE PROJECT AND WE WERE BEGUILED BY THE EXOTIC 
AND CHINA THE MORE WE LEARNT ABOUT QIN HOW UTTERLY RUTHLESS HE WAS 
AND EVERYTHING HE DID WAS FOR STANDARDISATION AND RIGOUR AND CONTROL 
SO SINCE THE BEGINNING WE HAVE BEEN CHUCKING OUT 
DECORATIVE ELEMENTS AND GETTING MORE AND MORE BASIC 
THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE THAT ONE 
THIS TO ME LOOKS LIKE CHINESE MAGAZINE BECAUSE OF THE CONTEMPORARY FEEL 
WHEREAS THIS IS MORE TRADITIONAL 
THIS LOOKS MORE CLASSICAL YES 
SO WE ARE DOWN TO THESE TWO REALLY DON'T YOU THINK 
JANE HAS TO BE ACROSS EVERY ASPECT OF THE EXHIBITION FROM TYPEFACES TO ANCIENT HISTORY 
THERE IS A LOT TO DO BUT IT'S VERY EXCITING 
HER IMMEDIATE TASK IS THE EXHIBITION CATALOGUE 
WITH ESSAYS BY THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERTS IN CHINESE HISTORY 
THIS LIST OF AUTHORS IS FANTASTIC 
I'M VERY IMPRESSED YOU'VE GOT EVERYBODY BUT ONE IN ON TIME 
YOU'RE A FIERCER EDITOR THAN I'VE EVER BEEN ABLE TO BE OBVIOUSLY 
WELL THE ONE WHO HASN'T REPLIED YET HE SAYS HE'S HAD A BEREAVEMENT 
AND HE'S GOING TO GET WORKING ON IT SOON 
PHOTOGRAPHS ARE REQUIRED TO ILLUSTRATE THE CATALOGUE 
THIS ONE HERE LOOKS JUST 
HIROMI KINOSHITA JANE'S ASSISTANT 
HAS RECENTLY BEEN TO CHINA WITH PHOTOGRAPHER JOHN WILLIAMS 
THIS WE CAN USE IN THE CATALOGUE BUT WE CAN ALSO USE IN THE EXHIBITION 
REALLY REALLY BIG TO SHOW THE HUGE NUMBERS OF FIGURES IN THE PIT 
WE'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT A PICTURE FOR THE COVER OF THE CATALOGUE OF COURSE 
AT THE MOMENT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS GETTING THE TEXT TOGETHER 
AND TRYING TO PUT PICTURES INTO THE TEXT 
THIS IS GREAT CAN WE SEE THIS 
LOOK AT THAT HEAD DRESS 
YES THAT'S A GENERAL'S HEAD DRESS HE'S THE UNARMOURED GENERAL 
YEAH YEAH 
HE'S GOT A REALLY GOOD FACE 
BOTH THE GENERALS HAVE GOT EXCELLENT FACES THOUGH 
IT'S AMAZING ISN'T IT THEY LOOK SO REAL 
AND THIS CHAP HERE IF I CAN FIND HIM THIS GUY'S GOT A GREAT FACE 
WE'VE JUST DECIDED ON THE TITLE AS WELL 
IT'S THE FIRST EMPEROR CHINA'S TERRACOTTA ARMY 
THE FIRST EMPEROR IS WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN 
THE TERRACOTTA ARMY PART OF IT IS OF COURSE TO DO WITH MARKETING BECAUSE 
THAT'S WHAT IS THE KEY THING PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT SO IT'S GOT BE IN THERE 
THE READING ROOM IS ABOUT TO CLOSE TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO THE TEMPORARY GALLERY 
THE FAMOUS DESKS ARE PART OF THE GRADE I LISTED FABRIC SO THEY CAN'T BE TOUCHED 
THAT MEANS THAT A PLATFORM HAS TO BE BUILT ABOVE THEM 
BELOW THEM THE HOLLOW STRUCTURE PRESENTS A PROBLEM FOR CONSTRUCTION CHIEF STEVE CLARKE 
THESE CEILINGS ARE JUST A SERIES OF ARCHES THAT WERE BUILT TO SUPPORT 
A LIGHT LEVEL LOADED FLOOR BY THE VICTORIANS 
THEY WERE NEVER DESIGNED FOR AN EXHIBITION SPACE SO WE CAN'T 
TRANSFER ONTO THIS BECAUSE THIS IS JUST A THIN LAYER OF BRICKWORK 
AND IT COULDN'T SUPPORT THE LOAD 
THE BUILDING AND DESIGN TEAMS HAVE TO SPREAD THE LOAD ACROSS 
THE RAISED PLATFORM AND THE MAJOR OBJECTS ARE VERY HEAVY 
THE TERRACOTTA WARRIORS WHICH ARE COMING OUT AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
THIS HORSE THOUGH IS THREE HUNDRED FORTY 
AND THEN THE HEAVIEST THING IS THIS BRONZE CHARIOT 
BUT IT'S OVER QUITE A LARGE AREA 
AND THAT'S ONE THOUSAND SIXTY ONE KILOGRAMS 
WHAT I'M FEELING SLIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT IS WE MIGHT NEED TO SPREAD THE LOAD 
THAT WOULD MEAN WE'D HAVE TO HAVE A SLIGHT RAISE IN THE HEIGHT OF THE FLOOR IN THOSE AREAS 
THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT MUCH THE PROBLEM IS 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT TO ME FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S QUITE A COMPROMISE 
WE DON'T WANT TO LOAD ANY MORE WEIGHT THAN WE HAVE 
THE SOONER WE CAN IDENTIFY THIS THE BETTER 
BECAUSE WE ARE GOING INTO MANUFACTURE IMMINENTLY YEP 
WE NEED TO THINK CREATIVELY THEN EVEN IF WE WENT FOR THIS SCHEME 
WE WERE HAVING A VERY USEFUL CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW 
THE ACTUAL INSTALLATION OF THE PLATFORM WILL INTEGRATE WITH THE EXHIBITION 
BECAUSE THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF HEAVY MATERIAL 
GOING IN THE EXHIBITION AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE 
THE PLATFORM CAN TAKE THE WEIGHT OF THE WARRIORS 
AND OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO'LL COME TO THE SHOW 
IT'S MID MARCH AND AFTER MONTHS OF PLANNING 
THE READING ROOM REFIT BEGINS 
THE BOOKS ARE GOING TO A TEMPORARY LIBRARY ELSEWHERE IN THE MUSEUM 
THE CONSTRUCTION SITE IS IN AN AWKWARD PLACE 
THE ROUND READING ROOM IS RIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF THE GREAT COURT OF THE MUSEUM 
FROM NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THAT SPACE IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC 
WHICH MEANS ALL OUR MATERIALS AND ALL OUR MEN 
NEED TO BE IN OUR WORKING SPACE BY NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
LOGISTICALLY THAT MEANS THE DELIVERIES COMING IN AT SEVEN A M. AND 
OUR LORRIES BEING OFF THE FORECOURT BY NINE A M. 
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM THERE'S ONLY ONE DOOR TO GET EVERYTHING IN AND OUT 
THE NEAREST ANALOGY IS LIKE BUILDING A SHIP IN A BOTTLE 
SO FANTASTIC EXHIBITION SPACE FOR THE MUSEUM 
LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE FOR THE BUILDER 
WE'VE GOT THE FIRST DELIVERY OF THE STEEL TODAY THE STEEL THAT 
ACTUALLY FORMS THE NEW DECK THAT THE EXHIBITION IS GOING TO BE ON 
THE LAST ESTIMATE WAS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE TONS OF STEEL COMING IN 
WE HAVE TO FINISH THE EXHIBITION SPACE BY THE END OF JUNE 
THAT GIVES THE EXHIBITION TEAM A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO COME AND 
DRESS THE EXHIBITION READY FOR THE PUBLIC 
THERE'S MORE EXHIBITION WORK TO BE DONE IN CHINA 
SO I'M JOINING JANE AND HIROMI IN XI'AN 
WE NEED BETWEEN HIS LEGS HERE 
YES BUT HIS FOOT 
BECAUSE THEY NEED THE POINT OF WEIGHT 
THREE OF THESE HORSES WE ARE HAVING ACTUALLY SO IT'S VERY USEFUL THAT THEY ARE IN A STATE OF BEING HALF 
BEING UNPACKED BECAUSE WE CAN MEASURE ALL THE MEASUREMENTS WE NEED FOR THE FLOOR LOADING FOR THE READING ROOM 
THESE OBJECTS HAVE COME BACK FROM AN EXHIBITION IN ROME AND THIS IS A CAVALRY HORSE HERE 
AND THEY HAD A BIT OF AN ACCIDENT 
IT WAS WHEN IT WAS BEING MOVED IN ROME THAT IT BROKE 
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE HORSES HAVE BEEN RESTORED ANYWAY 
YOU CAN SEE THE LINES OF RESTORATION THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A BROKEN HORSE WHICH HAS BEEN STUCK TOGETHER AGAIN 
SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN OLD BREAK 
IN THE TERRACOTTA WARRIORS PIT YOU CAN SEE THE WAY THE HORSES AND THE WARRIORS WERE EXCAVATED 
THEY WERE ALL LYING HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY ALL OVER THE PLACE IT'S RATHER A MOVING SIGHT 
IT LOOKS LIKE A SORT OF END OF A BATTLE OR SOMETHING WITH THEM ALL DEAD 
WHEN THE WARRIORS WERE DISCOVERED NOT A SINGLE ONE WAS INTACT 
EVERY STANDING FIGURE HAS BEEN PAINSTAKINGLY RECONSTRUCTED 
THERE'S ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE THAT THE FIGURES BROKE VERY SOON AFTER THE FIRST EMPEROR'S DEATH 
THE PITS WERE RANSACKED AND BURNED AND THE ROOFS COLLAPSED 
JANE AND I WENT INTO THE BACK OF THE PIT TO LOOK AT SOME WARRIORS UNDER REPAIR 
THIS IS STUNNING BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY 
GET A SENSE OF THE JIGSAW OF THEM PUTTING IT ALL BACK TOGETHER 
THE INTRICACY OF WHAT THEY HAD TO DO TO REBUILD THIS ARMY 
AND YOU CAN SEE HOW TALL THEY ARE YOU'RE PRETTY TALL 
THESE GUYS ARE BIG 
DO YOU KNOW ONE OF MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS APART FROM SCALE 
IS ACTUALLY THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR OWN RIGHT INDIVIDUALLY BEAUTIFUL SCULPTURES 
THEY LOOK VERY FIERCE AS WELL 
IT'S A SILLY THING TO SAY BUT THEY LOOK PARTICULARLY FIERCE I THINK 
THE MORE YOU LOOK AT THEM THE MORE DETAILS THERE ARE 
SO IT IS TRUE THAT EACH TERRACOTTA WARRIOR IS DIFFERENT 
I THINK EACH ONE IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT YES 
BUT THERE ARE SIMILARITIES THERE ARE SETS 
BUT THE DETAILS ARE DONE BY HAND SO THEY ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
HERE YOU CAN SEE A BELT HOOK AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE HOW THEY WERE USED 
AND IT'S EVEN MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE OUR EXHIBITION 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME BRONZE BELT HOOKS FROM THAT PERIOD 
THIS MAN HAS GOT A CENTRE PARTING AND A LITTLE GOATEE BEARD 
AND ROUND THE BACK HE'S GOT A RATHER INTERESTING 
SORT OF FRENCH PLAIT TYPE THING 
THE DETAIL THAT'S EXQUISITE 
AND THIS I GUESS IS A SORT OF HAIR SLIDE IN THE MIDDLE TO FIX IT TOGETHER 
AND IT'S VERY INTRICATELY PLAITED 
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY 
THESE ONES HAVE GOT SIDE TOPKNOTS AND PLAITS 
AND YOU CAN SEE NOT ONLY THE DETAILS OF THE PLAITS BUT THE DETAILS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL HAIR 
WHY DO YOU THINK THERE IS ALL THIS DIVERSITY WITH THE HAIRSTYLES 
WELL I THINK THEY SHOW DIFFERENT RANKS 
FOR EXAMPLE THE OFFICERS HAVE HATS ON 
THE INFANTRY A LOT OF THEM HAVE SIDE TOPKNOTS 
SO IT'S TO DO WITH RANK AND POSSIBLY TO DO WITH 
THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF CHINA THAT THEY COME FROM AS WELL 
THE FACES IN THE TERRACOTTA ARMY REFLECT THE DIFFERENT 
ETHNIC GROUPS BROUGHT HERE TO WORK FROM ACROSS THE EMPIRE 
YOU CAN STILL SEE THIS DIVERSITY IN THE FACES AROUND THE CITY 
THE TERRACOTTA ARMY IS BIG BUSINESS FOR XI'AN 
THERE'S A BOOMING TRADE IN REPLICA WARRIORS 
THE CHINESE INVENTED MASS PRODUCTION 
AND THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING THEIR BUOYANT ECONOMY TODAY 
YOU CAN ACTUALLY TOUCH THESE ONES CAN'T YOU 
IS THIS IN MINIATURE A BIT LIKE THE PROCESS THAT 
WAS GONE THROUGH TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO TO BUILD THE REAL TERRACOTTA SOLDIERS 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE IT 
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY LIKE IT BECAUSE THIS IS ONE SMALL TERRACOTTA WARRIOR BEEN BUILT IN ONE WHOLE MOULD 
WHEREAS OF COURSE THE BIG ONES WERE BUILT IN PIECES 
SOME OF THE PARTS WERE IN MOULDS LIKE THE HEADS 
YOU CAN TELL THEY'VE GOT LINES HERE WHERE THEY'VE BEEN JOINED TOGETHER 
AND ALSO THE HANDS WERE MADE IN MOULDS AND STUCK ON TO THE BODIES 
THE LEGS WERE SOMETIMES MADE WITH SLABS OF CLAY ROLLED INTO A PIPE LIKE DRAINPIPES 
IT DOES GIVE YOU A STRONG SENSE ALL THE LADIES HERE OF THE PRODUCTION LINE YES ABSOLUTELY 
JUST AS THESE REPLICAS ARE INDIVIDUALLY FINISHED BY HAND 
SO WERE THE ORIGINAL TERRACOTTA WARRIORS 
THE FULL SIZED FIGURES TAKE A WEEK TO BE FIRED IN A GIANT WALK IN KILN 
THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT THIS VAST ARMY WERE PART OF A MASSIVE LOGISTICAL OPERATION 
AND THIS IS WHAT UNDERPINS QIN SHIHUANGDI'S SUCCESS 
IF YOU CAN MANUFACTURE AND BUILD ON SUCH A MASSIVE SCALE 
YOU CAN MOBILISE AND SUPPLY ARMIES FOR LONG PERIODS 
THAT MEANS YOU CAN DEFEAT YOUR ENEMIES IN WAR 
ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF HOW THE QIN WORKERS CONSTRUCTED THE TERRACOTTA ARMY 
FIRST THEY DUG A PIT WITH ACCESS RAMPS AND BUILT WALLS OF COMPRESSED EARTH TO CREATE CORRIDORS 
THEN THEY CLOSED OFF THE PIT WITH A WOODEN ROOF 
THEY THEN CARRIED THE WARRIORS DOWN THE RAMPS INTO THE CORRIDORS 
PRESUMABLY THEY HAD SOME FORM OF LIGHTING AS OF COURSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DARK 
IT MUST HAVE TAKEN SKILL TO CARRY THE HEAVY WARRIORS HORSES AND CHARIOTS INTO THE CRAMPED SPACES 
ONCE THE ARMY WAS IN PLACE THE ROOF WAS COVERED IN MATTING 
THE ENTRANCES WERE SEALED AND EARTH PILED ON TOP 
THE UNDERGROUND ARMY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO BE SEEN BY HUMAN EYES 
AND IT REMAINED HIDDEN FOR OVER TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
THERE'S SOMETHING MANY OF US DON'T REALISE ABOUT THE WARRIORS 
WHEN THEY WERE ENTOMBED THEY DIDN'T LOOK AS THEY DO NOW 
WOW 
LOOK THESE ARE THE WARRIORS THAT HAVE GOT PIGMENT ON THEM 
THIS COMES AS A REAL SURPRISE TO ME 
WELL YES THEY ARE NOT TERRACOTTA COLOURED AT ALL THEY WERE BRIGHTLY PAINTED 
THIS WAS THE RESULT OF CONSERVATION WORK DONE WITH THE GERMANS 
AND THEY'VE COME UP WITH THIS TECHNIQUE OF PRESERVING THE PIGMENT 
THEY'VE GOT A FLESH COLOURED FACE 
AND THEN THESE WONDERFUL REDS THE DETAIL OF THE RED HOLDING THE ARMOURED PLATES TOGETHER 
THEN THIS FANTASTIC WHAT COLOUR IS THAT THIS IS THE HAN PURPLE IT'S CALLED 
IT'S ELECTRIC 
IT'S SO BRIGHT IT'S EXTRAORDINARY 
IT IS INCREDIBLE IT'S VERY RARE THIS COLOUR 
TO THINK THAT THEY HAD PURPLE ARMOUR IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE 
PURPLE YELLOW PINK BLUE RED 
DO WE KNOW IF THIS IS AN ACCURATE DEPICTION OF THE COLOURS THEY WOULD WEAR INTO BATTLE 
WELL WE DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT THE ARMOUR LOOKED LIKE 
WHAT THE CLOTHES LOOKED LIKE EXCEPT FOR THE WARRIORS THAT HAVE BEEN EXCAVATED FROM THE PITS 
SO ACTUALLY THIS IS OUR EVIDENCE 
WHETHER THE COLOUR WAS THE COLOURS THAT THE CLOTHES AND ARMOUR WOULD HAVE BEEN WHEN THEY WENT INTO BATTLE 
OR WHETHER THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN CEREMONIAL ARMOUR AND DRESS I DON'T KNOW 
PIT ONE IS STAGGERING ENOUGH 
BUT IMAGINE IF THEY WERE ALL IN THEIR ORIGINAL COLOURS 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE WOULDN'T IT SO BRIGHT 
THEY WOULD HAVE LOOKED AMAZING 
AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM IT'S MAY AND THE READING ROOM HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR TWO MONTHS 
NOBODY SEEMS TO BE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE TEMPORARY LIBRARY 
THE LIBRARIANS CAN STILL ACCESS THE BOOKS LEFT IN THE READING ROOM 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT CAROLYN AND STEVEN HAVE SEEN THE SPACE SINCE BUILDING WORK BEGAN 
OH IT'S HUGE 
SO THIS IS THE ARCHER 
GO DOWN THE STAIRS A BIT AND SEE WHEN YOU START TO SEE ME 
I CAN SEE YOU THERE THAT'S A PERFECT SIGHT LINE 
YEAH THAT IS AMAZING 
YOU'VE GOT A FANTASTIC VIEW 
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS YOU GET THE ARCHER 
HOW GOOD IS THAT 
SO WE'RE IN THE SECOND SECTION AND WHAT I REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND 
IS THE SCALE OF THE PRESENTATION OF THE WARRIORS 
AND I AM PRETTY BLOWN AWAY 
THERE'S DAVID AT THE OTHER END 
DAVID'S AT THE LECTERN EDGE THE RAIL 
SO FROM WHERE WE ARE HERE TO WHERE DAVID IS IS THE FOOTPRINT OF WHERE THE WARRIORS WILL BE POSITIONED 
YEAH IT'S WONDERFUL 
THEY ARE ON THIS FLOOR THAT IS A PUTTY COLOUR TERRACOTTA AS WELL 
IF YOU CAN PERSUADE YOUR CLIENT AND SAY I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD 
AND THE MODELS AND THE DRAWINGS YOU DO NOTHING IS LIKE STANDING THERE 
IT IS GOING TO LOOK EXTRAORDINARY 
THE LONG IMAGINED DESIGN IS EMERGING FROM THE DRAWING BOARD 
THE FABRIC WALL IS A SCREEN FOR PROJECTED IMAGES OF THE TERRACOTTA ARMY TO GIVE A SENSE OF SCALE 
SO WE'VE GOT THE ARMY HERE 
AND YOU'VE GOT THESE CHANGING SHOWS 
ON THE CYCLORAMA ON EITHER SIDE 
AS A GRAND THEATRICAL BACKDROP IT'S GOING TO BE SPECTACULAR 
A GREAT GREEN RING HIDES THE LIGHTING CABLES AND HELPS REDUCE THE ECHO IN THE ROOM 
WHILE ALLOWING VISITORS TO SEE THE BEAUTIFUL NINETEENTH CENTURY DOME WHICH IS ACTUALLY MADE OF PAPIER MACHE 
SO THE ROOM IS STILL A STAR 
IT IS ISN'T IT IT IS STILL EXPRESSED WITHIN THE EXHIBITION 
AND PEOPLE WON'T KNOW THEY WON'T REALISE 
THAT THEY'VE BEEN LIFTED UP INTO THE DOME 
AND IT WILL HAVE THAT MORE TOMB LIKE FEEL 
YES I HOPE SO YES 
QIN SHIHUANGDI HAD STARTED BUILDING HIS TOMB DURING HIS TWENTY FIVE YEAR REIGN AS KING OF QIN 
AND BUILDING WAS EXPANDED DURING HIS ELEVEN YEARS AS EMPEROR 
IT WAS AN AMAZING FEAT OF ORGANISATION WITH FORCED LABOUR FROM ALL OVER THE EMPIRE 
HE CONSCRIPTED SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS THAT'S TWICE THE POPULATION OF CARDIFF 
THE WHOLE AREA WAS MADE ITS OWN GOVERNMENT DISTRICT WITH OFFICIALS 
TO OVERSEE THE BUILDING AND THE MAINTENANCE OF THE BIG TOMB COMPLEX 
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SCENE HERE 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SEETHING WITH PEOPLE FACTORIES KILNS ARMOURIES AND POTTERIES 
EVERYONE WORKING TOWARDS ONE GOAL WHICH WAS ONE OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS 
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD 
NO ONE IS SURE HOW EXTENSIVE THE TOMB COMPLEX IS BUT THERE ARE FREQUENT NEW DISCOVERIES 
THESE BLUE SHEDS ENCLOSED PITS THAT WERE UNEARTHED IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
ONE CONTAINS SOME GRISLY REMAINS 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A PATHOLOGIST TO 
KNOW WHAT THESE BONES ARE HERE 
PRETTY EVOCATIVE REMAINS OF SOME OF THOSE WHO MUST HAVE DIED BUILDING THIS MASSIVE COMPLEX 
SOME OF THE ARMY OF SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND CONSCRIPTS 
I TALKED TO DUAN XINBOA 
WHO HAS ONE OF THE BEST JOBS IN WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY 
HE'S IN CHARGE OF EXCAVATING THE FIRST EMPEROR'S NECROPOLIS 
IT'S A LONG TERM PROJECT REQUIRING COMPULSORY PURCHASE OF THE LAND 
WE ARE MIGRATING ALL THE VILLAGES AND FACTORIES 
IN A TWO SQUARE KILOMETRE AREA AROUND THE TOMB MOUND 
FIRST WE WILL FOCUS ON THAT AREA 
AND THEN GRADUALLY WORK UP TO AN AREA OF SIXTY SQUARE KILOMETRES 
THEY'VE ALREADY MADE SOME STUNNING DISCOVERIES 
THE TOMB MOUND SITS AT THE HEART OF AN UNDERGROUND PALACE SURROUNDED BY RECTANGULAR STONE WALLS 
THE OUTERMOST IS TWENTY FIVE KILOMETRES LONG 
NORTH EAST OF THE TOMB MOUND BESIDE A LARGE LAKE 
IS AN F. SHAPED PIT WHICH CONTAINS LIFE SIZE BRONZE WATER BIRDS CRANES SWANS AND GEESE 
NEARBY THERE WERE TERRACOTTA MUSICIANS IN WOODEN COMPARTMENTS 
WITHIN THE PALACE WALLS IS A PIT WHICH CONTAIN TWO MAGNIFICENT HALF SCALE BRONZE CHARIOTS 
ONE HAS A COMPLETELY ENCLOSED CARRIAGE WHICH MAY ILLUSTRATE HOW 
THE FIRST EMPEROR TRAVELLED ON HIS TOURS AROUND THE EMPIRE 
ANOTHER PIT CONTAINS ENTERTAINERS AN ACROBAT WHO MIGHT ONCE HAVE SPUN A BALL 
A STRONGMAN WHOSE ARM ONCE GRIPPED A POLE 
AND A HUGE BRONZE VESSEL PERHAPS FOR WEIGHTLIFTING 
AND TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING RAN SMOOTHLY THERE WERE CIVIL SERVANTS 
PAPER HADN'T BEEN INVENTED BUT THESE MEN WROTE ON BAMBOO STRIPS 
THEY MADE CORRECTIONS WITH A KNIFE WORN ON THE BELT SHARPENED WITH A WHETSTONE 
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT TREASURES AWAIT THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS 
WHEN THE LOCAL RESIDENTS HAVE GONE AND THE WHOLE AREA CAN BE EXCAVATED 
BUT WORK CONTINUES WHERE POSSIBLE 
A HUGE COLLECTION OF ARMOUR HAS BEEN DISCOVERED VERY CLOSE TO THE TOMB MOUND 
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE DEEP WHAT IS IT 
SIX EIGHT TEN METRES 
DUAN XINBOA ESTIMATES THAT THIS TRENCH REPRESENTS JUST ONE PER CENT OF THE ENTIRE ARMOURY 
THIS IS THE ARMOUR MADE OF STONE 
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY INTRICATE PROCESS 
THEY ARE LABELLING EVERY SINGLE 
THEY ARE PREPARING TO LIFT ONE PART UP 
SO THEY ARE LABELLING IT 
CERTAIN PARTS ARE STILL QUITE INTACT THERE THERE'S A COUPLE OF PIECES THERE 
IS THIS ARMOUR FOR THE TORSO UP HERE 
IT'S FOR THE SHOULDER 
ONCE LIFTED IT'S TAKEN NEXT DOOR TO BE PAINSTAKINGLY RECONSTRUCTED 
EACH SUIT WEIGHS AROUND EIGHTEEN KILOGRAMS WITH UP TO EIGHT HUNDRED ONE LIMESTONE PIECES HELD TOGETHER WITH COPPER WIRE 
WHAT WAS STONE ARMOUR BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T WEAR IT IT WAS TOO HEAVY 
SO WHAT WAS IT DOING DOWN HERE 
IT WAS PROBABLY FOR USE IN THE SPIRIT WORLD 
YOU IN THE WEST BELIEVE THAT AFTER DYING THE SPIRIT GOES TO HEAVEN 
AND IN CHINA WE BELIEVE THE SAME THING 
WHO WAS WEARING THIS ARMOUR 
IS THIS SPARE ARMOUR IN CASE THE TERRACOTTA ARMY NEEDED SOME MORE 
THIS IS NOT FOR THE TERRACOTTA WARRIORS NO 
IN THE OTHER WORLD THE EMPEROR WOULD HAVE A SPIRIT ARMY 
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE TERRACOTTA WARRIORS DON'T HAVE HELMETS 
HERE THEY HAVE HELMETS SO IT SHOWS THAT ON THE BATTLEFIELD THE QIN ARMY DID HAVE HELMETS 
WHAT WAY OF THINKING HE HAD WHEN HE DECIDED TO HAVE STONE ARMOUR HE REALLY DOESN'T REALLY KNOW 
WE COULDN'T FIND REASONS FOR MANY THINGS 
FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T KNOW WHY HE MADE THE WARRIORS SO BIG OR WHY HE MADE BRONZE HORSES AND CHARIOTS 
BUT FOR ALL THAT WE DON'T KNOW DUAN XINBOA IS PROBABLY CLOSER TO THE FIRST EMPEROR THAN ANYONE 
I BELIEVE I AM THE PERSON WHO UNDERSTANDS HIM BEST 
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH TREASURE THERE IS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT HE PUT INTO HIS TOMB HIS NEW SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT 
IT'S A GRAND VISION 
NOT JUST A COLLECTION OF BEAUTIFUL ARTEFACTS FOR THE AFTERLIFE 
BUT A REPRESENTATION OF THE FIRST EMPEROR'S WHOLE SOCIETY 
THE UNITED CHINA HE CREATED SURROUNDING HIM IN HIS FINAL RESTING PLACE 
THE TOMB ITSELF HAS NEVER BEEN EXCAVATED WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S IN THERE 
WHAT WE DO KNOW COMES FROM ONE SOURCE THE HISTORIAN SIMA ZHEN 
WHO WROTE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE FIRST EMPEROR 
HE SAYS THE TOMB WAS FULL OF REPLICAS OF PALACES AND SCENIC TOWERS AS WELL AS RARE UTENSILS 
MERCURY WAS USED TO FASHION IMITATION OF THE ONE HUNDRED RIVERS THE YELLOW RIVER AND THE YANGTZE 
THE SEAS AND ABOVE WERE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES 
SO BASICALLY WHAT HE'S SAYING IS INSIDE THAT MOUNTAIN 
THERE IS A MODEL OF THE ENTIRE FIRST EMPEROR'S DOMAIN 
SIMA ZHEN RECORDS THAT CROSSBOWS WERE RIGGED TO SHOOT AT TOMB ROBBERS 
AND THAT MANY PEOPLE WERE SENT TO THEIR DEATHS IN THERE 
THE CRAFTSMEN WHO KNEW THE SECRETS OF THE TREASURES WITHIN AND THE EMPEROR'S CHILDLESS CONCUBINES 
WE CAN'T BE SURE ABOUT THE CROSSBOWS AND THE CORPSES 
BUT DUAN XINBOA AND COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE SOME FASCINATING DISCOVERIES 
USING GROUND PENETRATING RADAR AND OTHER NON INVASIVE SURVEYS 
UNTIL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT WHAT WAS UNDER THE MOUND 
WE HAVE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THE HOLLOW CHAMBER THE BOTTOM OF WHICH IS THIRTY METRES BELOW GROUND LEVEL 
IT'S A STONE STRUCTURE WITH A HOLLOW SPACE ABOUT FIFTEEN METRES HIGH 
A STONE CHAMBER SURROUNDED BY STEPPED WALLS IS FIFTY METRES WIDE 
AND EIGHTY METRES LONG LIKE THREE OLYMPIC SWIMMING POOL SIDE BY SIDE 
THE EMPEROR'S COFFIN PRESUMABLY LIES INSIDE 
AND THERE'S TANTALISING EVIDENCE THAT HE REALLY IS SURROUNDED BY MERCURY RIVERS AND SEAS 
WE FOUND HIGH LEVELS OF MERCURY IN THE SOIL OF THE TOMB MOUND 
THE MERCURY LEVELS ARE UP TO SEVENTY TIMES HIGHER THAN IN THE SOIL IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS 
THAT SEEMS TO SUPPORT THE VERSION OF THE TOMB FOUND IN THE BOOK 
WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE IS IN THERE 
PERHAPS MORE WARRIORS AND A HORDE OF TREASURES FROM AROUND HIS VAST EMPIRE 
THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE ON THE PLANET 
THIS IS THE PLACE THAT KEEPS ARCHAEOLOGISTS ALL OVER THE WORLD 
UP AT NIGHT AND FOR MY PART I HOPE THEY OPEN IT UP BEFORE I DIE 
FOR NOW THE EMPEROR AND HIS ENTOURAGE LIE UNDISTURBED 
THE TOMB IS A TOURIST ATTRACTION 
A PLEASANT PLACE TO VISIT ESPECIALLY TO DRESS UP AS AN EMPEROR 
OR IF YOU JUST WANT TO CLIMB UP FOR THE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAIN VIEWS 
WELL JANE PRETTY TIRING 
IT MIGHT HAVE ERODED A BIT BUT I'M STILL FEELING IT NO 
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT THAT'S THE OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK 
THANKS VERY MUCH 
LOOK AT THE VIEW YES LOOK AT THE VIEW 
SNEAKY 
AND WE'RE STANDING ON TOP OF THE TOMB CHAMBER 
AND HE BUILT IT HIGH BECAUSE HE BELIEVED THIS BROUGHT HIM CLOSER TO THE GODS 
IT'S IN THE SHAPE OF A MOUNTAIN 
YOU KNOW HE WENT ON TOURS AROUND CHINA AND HE WROTE INSCRIPTIONS ON MOUNTAINS 
AND HE HAD HIS TOMB BUILT LIKE A MOUNTAIN 
IT'S LIKE HE'S MAKING HIS TOMB PART OF THE CHINESE LANDSCAPE MAKING HIMSELF PART OF CHINA 
WOULD YOU OPEN IT UP 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S SUCH A TRICKY QUESTION IT'S UP TO THEM REALLY 
OF COURSE WHAT WOULD YOU DO 
WELL I DO THINK CAUTION IS IMPORTANT 
I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO WAIT UNTIL 
IT'S POSSIBLE TO EVEN THINK ABOUT PRESERVING WHAT THEY MIGHT FIND 
BUT IT'S REALLY A QUESTION AT THE MOMENT OF THEM NOT WANTING TO DISTURB HIM 
HE IS STILL THERE 
HE'S THERE 
AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM THE READING ROOM WINDOWS HAVE BEEN BLACKED OUT 
SO IT'S MORE TOMB LIKE INSIDE THE NEW GALLERY 
IT'S QUITE FRAUGHT PROBABLY IS THE WORD BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE FINAL COUPLE OF WEEKS NOW 
WE ARE ALL VERY EXCITED BECAUSE WE'VE JUST HIT A RECORD FOR THE MUSEUM 
WE'VE MANAGED TO GET FIFTY THOUSAND TICKETS SOLD IN ADVANCE FOR THE EXHIBITION WHICH IS A RECORD FOR US 
IT'S REALLY EXCITING 
THAT WILL BE TWELVE PLEASE 
BUT APART FROM THAT THE SHOPS ARE GETTING PREPARED 
THE CATERING ALL SORTED OUT 
THERE'S A LOT OF BUZZ OUTSIDE THE READING ROOM AS WELL 
BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVE GOT TO DELIVER FOR THOSE FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE NOW 
THERE'S NOW A PARTITION WALL DIVIDING THE EXHIBITION INTO TWO HALVES LIFE AND DEATH 
WITH A DOORWAY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER 
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE FIRST EMPEROR COMES FROM THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF THE TOMB 
AND THE HISTORIAN SIMA ZHEN 
WE KNOW THAT HE HAD AT LEAST TWO SONS 
BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE NAMES OF HIS EMPRESS OR CONCUBINES 
OR IF HE TRULY BELIEVED HE WAS A LIVING GOD 
THE EMPEROR CALLED HIMSELF DIVINE BUT OF COURSE HE WASN'T HE WAS ALL TOO HUMAN 
HE BECAME OBSESSED WITH IMMORTALITY 
HE SET HIS SERVANTS OFF TO THE FURTHEST FLUNG PARTS OF HIS EMPIRE 
LOOKING FOR HERBS AND MUSHROOMS ANYTHING TO MAKE HIM IMMORTAL 
SOME SAY HE ALSO ATE MERCURY NOT KNOWING THAT IT WAS POISONOUS 
BUT HE COULDN'T ESCAPE DEATH 
IT CAME ON A JOURNEY AROUND HIS EMPIRE 
NEWS OF IT WAS SUPPRESSED PERHAPS FOR FEAR OF AN UPRISING 
HIS BODY WAS RETURNED TO THE CAPITAL IN A CARRIAGE POSSIBLY LIKE THE BRONZE CHARIOT BURIED WITH HIM 
HIS COURTIERS CARRIED SUPPLIES OF DRIED FISH TO MASK THE SMELL OF HIS ROTTING CORPSE 
AFTER HIS DEATH QIN SHIHUANGDI'S SONS WEREN'T REALLY UP TO THE JOB 
HIS DYNASTY CAME TO A VIOLENT END A FEW YEARS LATER 
BUT A NEW EMPEROR TOOK OVER AND FOUNDED A NEW DYNASTY AND THAT'S THE POINT 
FROM THEN ON THE FIGHTING WAS NOT ABOUT DISMANTLING CHINA BUT DOMINATING IT 
QIN SHIHUANGDI HAD CREATED MORE THAN JUST AN EMPIRE 
HE'D CREATED AN IDEA THAT WOULD PROVE SO POWERFUL THAT IT 
WAS NEVER SERIOUSLY CHALLENGED OVER THE NEXT TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
IN THE MIDDLE OF A CHILLY AUGUST IT'S CLOSING TIME AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM 
AFTER TRAVELLING THOUSANDS OF MILES THE PRECIOUS OBJECTS FROM THE FIRST EMPEROR'S TOMB ARE ARRIVING 
IT'S VERY EXCITING TO SEE THIS BUT IT'S A BIT SCARY 
BUT I'M SURE IT'S ALL UNDER CONTROL REALLY 
I SLIGHTLY FEEL THAT I DON'T HAVE A FUNCTION 
IT'S ALL SO WELL ORGANISED I MIGHT AS WELL NOT BE HERE 
IT'S AN ALL NIGHT JOB FOR THE HEAVY LIFTING TEAM TO GET THE CRATES IN 
EACH HORSE WEIGHS THREE HUNDRED FORTY KILOS 
ALL THE OBJECTS HAVE TO BE BROUGHT IN THROUGH THE READING ROOM DOOR 
THEN LIFTED UP TO THE EXHIBITION FLOOR 
THE TERRACOTTA WARRIORS MUSEUM HAS SENT ITS TOP TEAM TO HELP WITH THE INSTALLATION 
THEIR LACK OF ENGLISH DOESN'T WORRY DARRYL DAY 
MY CHINESE IS NOT GREAT 
BUT WE ARE USING THE UNIVERSAL SIGN LANGUAGE FOR OBJECT MOVING 
WHICH SEEMS TO BE WORKING FOR ME AND THEIR TECHNICIAN AS WELL 
THE SMALL OBJECTS ARE OPENED AND CHECKED BEFORE BEING TAKEN TO THE READING ROOM 
WHAT WE WANT TO TRY AND DO IS PUT THE STONE HELMET AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORN ON TOP OF THE STONE ARMOUR 
BUT WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HAPPY THAT WE CAN DO THAT ABSOLUTELY SAFELY 
THERE ARE STILL DECISIONS TO BE MADE ABOUT DISPLAYING CERTAIN OBJECTS 
LIKE A LARGE WEIGHT PROVIDING A STANDARD FOR TRADE UNDER THE FIRST EMPEROR 
THIS IS THE ONE THAT'S GOT THE INSCRIPTION AROUND THE BACK YES 
AND THIS IS IN RELIEF SO IT LOOKS RATHER NICE 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO PUT IT THIS WAY AROUND 
IT WOULD BE NICE TO LET AUDIENCES KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING AROUND THE OTHER SIDE 
THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS WITH A MIRROR OR A PICTURE 
THERE'S ALSO A PROBLEM WITH THE STANDARD MEASURE WHICH HAS BEEN 
DISPLAYED TO SHOW AN INSCRIPTION ON THE BACK OF THE SCOOP 
THE ONLY THING THAT WORRIES ME SLIGHTLY PUTTING IT UPSIDE DOWN 
IS THAT WILL PEOPLE REALISE THAT IT'S A MEASURE FOR PUTTING STUFF IN IF IT'S UPSIDE DOWN 
YOU COULD TILT IT PERHAPS 
AGAIN YOU SEE IT'S A MATTER OF WHEN YOU TRIED IT THIS WAY YOU CAN 
SEE IT'S A MEASURE BUT YOU CAN'T SEE MUCH OF THE INSCRIPTION 
AND THEN YOU JUST LOOK INTO THE INSIDE AND IT'S RATHER BORING 
THE CHINESE DON'T ALLOW THE HALF SIZE BRONZE CHARIOTS ABROAD 
SO THEY'VE MADE A REPLICA FOR LOAN 
ONE TERRACOTTA FIGURE HAS ARRIVED WITH A LITTLE PROBLEM 
HERE'S THE ACROBAT AND HERE'S THE MOUNT 
IT'S NOT THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF MOUNTS 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT HE CAN'T STAND UP ON HIS OWN HE'S ONLY GOT ONE LEG 
AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE CAN GET ANYBODY TO MAKE A MOUNT IN TIME 
AND GET A MOUNT MADE THAT IS BETTER LOOKING THAN THIS ONE 
IT MUST BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE HIM BE ABLE TO STAND UP WITHOUT HAVING 
THIS WHOLE FRAMEWORK AROUND HIS LEG FOR THE WHOLE OF THE LEG TO GO IN 
IT MUST BE POSSIBLE TO PUT A PEG LEG OF SOME SORT 
TO JUST TO SUPPORT HIM ON ONE SIDE 
AND THESE PERSPEX BARS ARE ACTUALLY DISTRACTING 
IT WOULD DRAW ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT HE ONLY HAS ONE LEG 
THAT IS A BIT OF A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS HAVING A ONE LEGGED ACROBAT 
THE REAL STARS OF THE SHOW ARE THE TERRACOTTA WARRIORS 
THE MUSEUM PRESS TEAM HAS ORGANISED A PHOTOCALL AS THE FIRST ONE IS UNCRATED 
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE LIFTING IT AND GETTING IT OUT 
HALF AN HOUR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WHY YOU GOT ANOTHER JOB ON THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS 
IF YOU CAN TAKE THE CAMERAS BACK A LITTLE SO IT'S NOT OVER THE TOP 
CAN YOU JUST GET A HAND ON THE WARRIOR 
NICE AND EASY 
A BIT MORE POUTING 
COME BACK A LITTLE BIT MORE 
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE HIM OFF THE FRAMES UNTIL THEY HAVE DECIDED WHERE THEY'RE GOING YES 
THE PRECIOUS TERRACOTTA FIGURES ARE LEFT IN THEIR WOODEN TRAVELLING CRADLES UNTIL THE VERY LAST MOMENT 
AND THEN EVERYONE HOLDS THEIR BREATH AND HOPES THEY STAND UPRIGHT 
ONE TWO THREE 
O. K. YOU NEED TO GO QUITE A BIT OVER YES 
MY LEFT MY LEFT MY LEFT O. K. 
YES I THINK THAT'S QUITE GOOD THEN YOU CAN MOVE THE ACROBAT 
VERY VERY NICE 
FINALLY THE EXHIBITION IS READY TO OPEN TELLING THE STORY OF THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CHINA'S FIRST EMPEROR 
THE ORIGINAL AIM WAS TO LET YOU GET REALLY CLOSE TO THE THINGS 
SO THAT YOU COULD SEE THAT THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS 
THAT THEY ARE CRAFTED SEPARATELY AND THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY 
REALLY ARE WORKS OF ART THAT THESE ARE SCULPTURES AS WELL AS MASSED RANKS 
THIS CHARIOT'S GREAT ISN'T IT 
YES I THINK IT'S VERY CLEVER THE WAY THEY'VE MADE THIS REPLICA TO SHOW THE ONES THAT WOULD HAVE DISINTEGRATED 
AND THEN HERE YOU'VE GOT THIS LIGHT INFANTRYMAN THE ONE WITH THE BIG NOSE 
THEY LOOK ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL HERE AND IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE THEM SO CLOSE 
I LOVE THE DETAILS ON HIS FACE WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE HANDS 
ALMOST OF THE WORKMEN THE LINES ON HIS FACE IN THE CLAY 
JANE I THINK IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL ARE YOU HAPPY WITH IT 
I THINK IT'S MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE 
THE DESIGN AND THE DISPLAY IS FANTASTIC 
AS FAR AS THE CONTENT IS CONCERNED I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME 
TO JUDGE THAT BECAUSE I'M SO CLOSE TO IT I KNOW IT SO WELL 
AND I REALLY HOPE PEOPLE WILL LIKE IT
