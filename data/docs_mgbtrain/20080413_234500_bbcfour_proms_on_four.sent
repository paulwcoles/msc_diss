IN A PERFORMANCE OF MOZART'S REQUIEM 
THE CREATION OF MOZART'S REQUIEM 
IS A TALE SHROUDED IN MYSTERY AND INTRIGUE 
AT ONE POINT IT WAS BELIEVED THAT IT WAS EVEN PART OF A SINISTER PLOT 
THAT RESULTED IN MOZART'S DEATH 
THE TRUTH IS NO LESS STRANGE 
MOZART ACCEPTED A COMMISSION DESPERATELY SHORT OF MONEY 
FROM ONE COUNT FRANZ WALSEGG 
WALSEGG WAS AN AMATEUR MUSICIAN WHO USED TO ENGAGE PROFESSIONALS 
TO WRITE HIM PIECES THAT HE'D THEN PASS OFF AS HIS OWN 
WALSEGG WANTED A REQUIEM TO REMEMBER HIS WIFE 
WHO'D DIED ON VALENTINE'S DAY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY ONE 
MOZART BEGAN WORK ON THE PIECE BUT WAS SOON DIVERTED 
BY HIS OPERAS LA CLEMENZA DI TITO AND THE MAGIC FLUTE 
WHEN HE DIED ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIALLY SKETCHED 
THE REQUIEM WAS FAR FROM COMPLETED 
THAT'S WHEN MOZART'S WIDOW CONSTANZE COMES INTO THE STORY 
SHE WAS A KEEN BUSINESS WOMAN AND WAS WELL AWARE 
THAT WALSEGG MIGHT COME AND ASK FOR HIS MONEY BACK 
SO SHE ENGAGED ONE OF MOZART'S STUDENTS FRANZ XAVER SUESSMAYR TO COMPLETE THE PIECE 
HE FACED AN UPHILL TASK HAVING TO WRITE THE SANCTUS 
THE BENEDICTUS AND THE AGNUS DEI 
VIRTUALLY FROM SCRATCH 
HERE COME THE SOLOISTS THE SOPRANO CAROLYN SAMPSON 
CONTRALTO INGEBORG DANZ TENOR MARK PADMORE 
AND BASS ALFRED REITER 
WITH CONDUCTOR PHILIPPE HERREWEGHE 
JOINING THE ORCHESTRE DES CHAMPS ELYSEES 
AND THE CHOIR COLLEGIUM VOCALE GENT
