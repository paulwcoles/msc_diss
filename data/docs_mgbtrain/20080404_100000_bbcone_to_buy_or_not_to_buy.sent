UNLESS I'M VERY MUCH MISTAKEN YOU'VE TUNED IN TO THE BEST PROGRAMME ON DAYTIME TELEVISION 
IT'S TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
IS IT I THOUGHT IT WAS DALLAS NO 
THE GLITZ THE GLAMOUR THE DOWNRIGHT GORGEOUSNESS OF FINDING TWO LUCKY PEOPLE THEIR DREAM HOME 
THAT'S WHY I'M IN THE JOB 
I'M IN THE JOB FOR DIFFERENT REASONS ONE I GET A FREE LUNCH 
TWO I GET TO STUFF AS MUCH CHOC CHIP ICE CREAM DOWN MY FACE IN ONE DAY 
SO EARLY AND YET YOU'RE ALREADY WORRYING ME 
TODAY WE'RE IN THE GORGEOUS COUNTY OF DORSET FINDING THREE 
NOT ONE NOT TWO BUT THREE FABULOUS HOMES FOR THEM TO MUSE 
ONE OF THOSE AFOREMENTIONED PROPERTIES WILL AFFORD OUR LUCKY LUCKY PUNTERS A UNIQUE CHANCE 
YES THE CHANCE TO TRY BEFORE THEY BUY 
AND HERE THEY ARE TODAY'S BUYERS 
ED HOW ON EARTH DO I SAY THAT 
DIRCKZE THEY HAVE TWO LOVELY KIDS 
JESSICA WHO'S NINE AND SIX YEAR OLD HOLLY 
GRANT IS A VERY BUSY MAN AND WORKS AS A HEAD CHEF AT A LOCAL PUB 
DOES THAT MEAN HE COOKS HEADS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS 
I LIKE IT EMMA WORKS AS A CUSTOMER SERVICES OFFICER FOR A LOCAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION 
SO YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE FOUND HER OWN HOUSE QUITE FRANKLY 
MAYBE SHE HASN'T GOT THE MAGICAL TOUCH THAT YOU AND I HAVE KRISTIAN 
THAT IS WHY WE'VE BEEN ENLISTED TO HELP THEM OUT 
COME ON 
GRANT AND EMMA OUR FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF HOUSE HUNTING FUN IS GOING TO START NOW 
AND WE'RE AIMING TO HAVE FUN TODAY AND HOPEFULLY FIND A HOUSE BUT THAT'S SECONDARY 
WHAT'S THE AIM WHAT ARE WE GOING FOR 
WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
PROBABLY LOCATION I WOULD SAY O. K. THAT'S OUR RIVAL HOUSE HUNTING SHOW DON'T SAY THAT 
NORMALLY PEOPLE SAY SPACE 
O. K. SPACE AS WELL NO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT I WAS GOING TO 
I'M JUST SAYING SPACE IS USUALLY UP THERE IT'S GOT INTO A TERRIBLE ROW 
LET'S SAY LOCATION AND SPACE 
LET'S HOME IN ON THAT WHERE IS THE LOCATION 
UM PREDOMINANTLY AN AREA CALLED SHAFTESBURY 
WHICH IS ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES FROM HERE SO WE'RE AIMING FOR THAT AREA BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE CLOSER 
TO WHERE THEY'RE AT SCHOOL AND ALSO WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GO ON TO SCHOOL 
SO CATCHMENT AREAS IS THE WELL IT DOES PLAY A PART YES 
I HAVE A QUESTION 
GRANT SPACE YES 
WHAT'S WRONG HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU NEED AND WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR SPACE WISE LOADS MORE LOADS MORE 
IS NEEDED I THINK AS MUCH AS POSS 
YES FOR THE KIDS AS WELL IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO GET INTO SEPARATE ROOMS 
O. K. AND FOR ME I'D LOVE TO THINK THAT I HAVE SPACE TO BE ABLE TO DO MUSIC 
I JUST WALKED PAST YOUR DRUM KIT IT'S HUGE YOU'VE LOST YOUR DINING ROOM TO IT 
THAT'S RIGHT I'M TRYING TO GET THE KIDS TO EAT OFF THE DRUM KIT OFF A CYMBAL 
THEY ARE LIKE MINI PLATES AREN'T THEY 
EATING WOULD BE A FAR MORE MUSICAL EXPERIENCE AND MUSIC AIDS DIGESTION SO ACTUALLY IT WORKS 
REALLY IT'S AN EXTRA BEDROOM AND AN EXTRA CLOAKROOM OR BATHROOM OR LOO BECAUSE WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE 
WE'VE NEVER DONE ONE WHERE YOU WANT A CLOAKROOM BEFORE 
BRILLIANT CLOAKROOM AS IN THE POSH WORD FOR TOILET EXACTLY YES RIGHT 
YOU NEVER ACTUALLY FIND CLOAKS IN THERE WELL YOU DO BUT YOU WOULDN WANT YOUR CLOAKS STORED IN THERE 
WELLIES AND COATS AND STUFF 
ANYTHING MADE OUT OF RUBBER NOT IMPERVIOUS FABRICS 
SO PREFERABLY A DOWNSTAIRS LOO OR SOME SORT OF SECOND BATHROOM 
REFERRED TO AS A CLOAKROOM FROM HERE ON IN EXACTLY 
AND ANOTHER BEDROOM THAT'S THE MAIN 
IN TERMS OF BEING FASHIONISTAS WHAT KIND OF STYLE OF PROPERTY WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO SEE 
WE'D QUITE LIKE A CHARACTER PROPERTY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE 
BUT ALSO WE HAVE LIVED IN HONG KONG WHICH IS VERY MODERN AND IN AUSTRALIA 
AND ALSO LIVED IN MODERN PROPERTIES SO WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY AVERSE TO SO YOU WOULD PREFER OLD 
WE PREFER CHARACTER 
YOU PREFER CHARACTER PROBABLY OLD BUT MIGHT LOOK AT MODERN AS WELL YES 
IF MODERN HAS THE SPACE AND THE LOCATION 
AND THE CLOAKROOM THAT'S RIGHT SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO COMPLETELY RULE OUT MODERN 
IF IT'S IN THE AREA THAT WE WANT HAS THE SPACE THAT WE WANT AT THE PRICE THAT WE WANT 
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE WE ASK THE WORST QUESTION ON DAYTIME T. V. I DON'T THINK SO 
IF I JUST TURN AWAY CASUALLY AND PRETEND I DIDN'T SAY IT 
THIS IS SO BAD TURN AWAY WHAT BEFORE 
JUST TURN AWAY TURN AWAY 
ARE YOU READY WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET HAVE YOU DONE IT I'VE DONE IT

FOR NIGHTS SPENT BY VISITORS AND SECOND FOR VISITOR SPENDING 
ITS HISTORIC MARKET TOWN OF SHAFTESBURY IS WHERE WE'RE CONCENTRATING ON TODAY

AH INSPIRATIONAL DORSET 
LITTLE WONDER THAT THIS COUNTY WAS HOME TO AUTHORS JANE AUSTEN WILLIAM BARNES WILLIAM WORDSWORTH 
ALL VERY INTERESTING ED 
BUT MOST IMPRESSIVELY TONY BLACKBURN LIVED IN DORSET DURING HIS CHILDHOOD 
AND THIS POP PICKERS IS WHAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY GRAND WILL GET YOU IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
THAT WAS FLUFF FREEMAN'S CATCHPHRASE ED NOT TONE'S 
APOLOGIES IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE KIND OF PLACE THAT YOU CAN CASUALLY WASH 
YOUR CAR OUTSIDE WHILE THE IDYLLIC TWENTY FOUR CHILDREN LOOK ON THEN TRY THIS PROPERTY IN MINEHEAD SOMERSET 
THIS BEAUTIFUL SIXTEENTH CENTURY LISTED COTTAGE WILL SET YOU BACK TWO HUNDRED FIFTY GRAND 
OR IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE AN EX VICAR THAT MISSES HIS OR HER CHURCH

HEY SO WHAT SONG CAN WE HAVE 
TO GET US IN THE MOOD FOR SCOUTING AROUND SHAFTESBURY 
IT CAN ONLY BE ONE COME ON GET YOUR GROOVE ON 
THEME FROM SHAFT BY ISAAC HAYES 
HELLO HELLO THERE PLEASED TO MEET YOU HOW CAN I HELP 
HOPEFULLY MASSIVELY 
I'M ON A QUEST I HAVE A FELLOW WHO IS A DRUMMER CALLED GRANT RIGHT

HELLO CAN I BUY A LOAF IF POSSIBLE 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE I'D LIKE TO GET MY HANDS ALL OVER YOUR BLOOMERS 
THEY ALSO WANT A CLOAKROOM DOWNSTAIRS IN THE POSH SENSE OF THE WORD CLOAKROOM 
IT'S STILL WARM IT IS STILL WARM 
IT'S STILL WARM 
I NEED THREE BEDROOMS AND THEY WANT CHARACTER 
IT SEEMS LIKE A PROPER TOWN VILLAGE THE WAY IT SHOULD BE 
IN TERMS OF EVERYONE BEING LOVELY AND FRIENDLY I QUITE AGREE 
IS IT POSSIBLE ROUND HERE 
YOU'RE SLIGHTLY LIMITED WITH THE CHARACTER SIDE OF THINGS BUT I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF PROPERTIES 
THE REST OF THE U. K. ARE YOU WATCHING YOU SHOULD BE COPYING SHAFTESBURY 
CAN I ASK WHERE ARE YOUR COMPUTERS 
WELL THERE'S AN INTERESTING ONE 
THEY'RE ALL DOWN IN OUR GILLINGHAM BRANCH AT OUR HEAD OFFICE AND WE BASICALLY WORK OFF THEM 
WE DO HAVE A FAX MACHINE AND THAT'S THE ONLY CONCESSION TO THE MODERN WORLD YES 
I'VE JUST REALIZED I'VE BEEN TO SHAFTESBURY MANY MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A CHILD 
OF COURSE WHEN I WERE A LAD YOU COULD GET A THREE BED SEMI FOR THRUPPENCE HA'PENNY 
MY HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED 
NEW WORLD SYMPHONY BY DVORAK 
I HAVE A PROPERTY HERE WHICH IS NOT FAR AWAY AND IT DOESN'T UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A DOWNSTAIRS LOO 
BUT IT HAS A SHED OUTSIDE WITH A LOO 
SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE STEPPING BACK IN TIME A LITTLE BIT LIKE NICHOLAS LYNDHURST IN GOODNIGHT SWEETHEART 
O. K. VERY EXCITINGLY NOT ONLY IS THIS THE TOWN HALL BUT TODAY 
THERE'S A FLEA MARKET GOING ON INSIDE 
THAT'S QUITE SWEET I LIKE THAT AND I GUESS YOU COULD DRUM THERE AS WELL I THINK SO 
THERE IS A BRILLIANT SHED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN SO WE COULD SEND HIM DOWN THERE 
THAT'S A GOOD THEORY 
THIS IS VERY BIZARRE I'M LOOKING FOR A SMALL THREE BEDROOM PROPERTY WITH PERIOD FEATURES 
HERE'S YOUR CHARACTER COTTAGE IT'S GOT TO HAVE LOADS OF CHARACTER 
I DIDN'T WANT ONE WITH AN OPENING ROOF THOUGH 
I WANTED ONE WITH A MORE SECURE ROOF WELL THIS IS VENTILATION FOR THE SUMMER OH GREAT 
YOU'VE ONLY GONE AND FOXED ME BECAUSE EACH ONE OF THOSE IS GOOD 
WHAT ELSE YOU'VE DONE IS YOU'VE BEEN FAIR WITH THE PRICES AS WELL I THINK I'VE DONE FAIRLY WELL 
YOU'VE DONE SUPERBLY THERE'S THE HAND THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
OH 
JUST AS I WAS LEAVING JUST AS I WAS LEAVING 
I HAVE FOUND A SMALL PROPERTY WITH A BARN CONVERSION ON THE SIDE 
FOR TEN IT'S REALLY A BIT OF A STEAL ISN'T IT 
I THINK IT'S WOOD 
I TELL YOU WHAT SOMEONE IS STEALING MY JOB TODAY 
KRISTIAN AND I HAVE BEEN HAVING A LOVELY TIME AROUND THE AREA OF SHAFTESBURY 
I'VE MET A SUPERB ESTATE AGENT 
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS HELPFUL WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO I FOUND A HILL 
A HILL I'VE ALSO FOUND A VERY VERY GORGEOUS PROPERTY 
NINETEEN TEN SHE WAS BUILT ARTS AND CRAFTS ERA 
THAT REALLY IS ARTS AND CRAFTS 
AND CAN I SAY CLEVERLY EXTENDED THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS 
ALL RIGHT THIS IS BEAUTIFUL 
OLD GRANT IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO IN THE BACK GARDEN ON THIS ONE TO BANG HIS DRUMS 
IT DOES NEED A BIT OF WORK AND MAYBE HIS TEN TOOLKIT 
MIGHT NEED TO BE EXTENDED SLIGHTLY 
I HAVEN'T YET DISCUSSED THE WILD CARD WITH EDWARD BUT THE WILDCARD I HAVE FOUND IT'S ALL O. K. 
TODAY THE WILD CARD IS 
A TOY FARM 
THE REASON WHY IT'S GOOD IT'S FOURTEEN ACRES IT'S IN VERY GOOD NICK 
THAT'S ONE FOOT BY TWO FOOT IF YOU WERE SMALLER THIS IS FOURTEEN ACRES 
I SUPPOSE SPACE WISE ALTHOUGH YOU COULD ACTUALLY SHOW THE REAL WILD CARD 
WHICH IS THIS HUNK OF FUN THIS IS BEAUTIFUL 
THIS IS GOOD IT REALLY IS GOOD IT'S GREAT 
I READ THE FIRST BIT THAT THE PROPERTY HANDLING TEAM SENT ME AND I SAID YOU'VE DONE WELL HERE 
IT'S A TRADITIONAL FAMILY HOME SAY NO MORE 
SAY NO MORE BECAUSE LET'S COMMENCE THE VIEWINGS WITH PROPERTY NUMBER ONE MY ONE OH IT IS AS WELL 
SO OUR FIRST STOP IS MY CHOICE 
AND A CHOICE THAT THE PROPERTY TEAM AND I ARGUED ABOUT UNTIL WE WERE BLUE IN THE FACE 
THEY'RE A FEISTY BUNCH WELL WE TALKED ABOUT IT AND THEN WE ALL REALIZED I WAS RIGHT 
GRANT AND EMMA EMMA AND GRANT GRANT AND EMMA EMMA AND GRANT 
WE'RE BEGINNING THE TOUGHEST PROPERTY HUNT WE HAVE DONE TODAY 
YOU CAN'T FIND ONE WE CAN IN THEORY 
WE ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT GOLD HILL YOU KNOW THE FAMOUS THE BOY AND THE BIKE SHOVING UP A HILL 
WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO LIVE THERE 
YOU COULD SELL THIMBLES OF THAT PLACE AND A POSTCARD CONCESSION OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOUSE 
SO THAT'S MONEY COMING IN BACKED 
IN THE BACK GARDEN YOU HAVE A SHED FOR YOUR DRUMMING YAY 
YOU HAVE A CLOAKROOM YOU HAVE ALL THE ROOMS YOU NEED 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY AND YOU'VE GOT A SMALL INDUSTRY WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YES I LIKE THE AREA AND IT LOOKS NICE FROM THE OUTSIDE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK GRANT I'M INTERESTED IN THE BREAD DEFINITELY 
AND THE DRUMS IN THE BACK SOUNDS GOOD 
WHY DO YOU BOTH LOOK SLIGHTLY SCARED OR IS IT ME NO NO YOU'RE COOL YOU'RE CALM 
WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT IS SO RIGHT IT'S RIGHT SOMETIMES IT PRODUCES A DIFFERENT EMOTION 
AND IT'S LOOKING QUITE EXCITING FROM THE OUTSIDE GO ON SAY NO MORE 
GO ON GO GO GO GO 
WE'RE GOING TO GO AND DO THE HEADPHONES BEFORE THE CAR SQUASHES US GO 
SO THIS BIT IS GOOD BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT STEPPING RIGHT ONTO THE ROAD SO THE KIDS HAVE 
GOT A BIT OF SPACE TO LOITER BEFORE CROSSING THE ROAD WHICH IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM OUR PLACE NOW 
THEY'RE PRAISING THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE BEFORE THEY HAVE GONE INSIDE 
SAFETY FIRST 
OH WOW THIS IS NICE I LIKE THE BRICK 
IT'S QUITE UNIQUE 
I'VE NOT SEEN THAT IN A LOUNGE BEFORE IT'S REALLY COOL 
I SENSE THEIR VOICES HAVE VISIBLY DIPPED IN AWE OF THAT ROOM 
THIS IS A GOOD SPACE 
VERY NICE 
EXCELLENT STORAGE FOR C. D.S. 
HE'S PICKED UP ON THE C. D.'S BEING A MUSIC FAN 
I NOTICED THERE'S A MIDNIGHT OIL C. D. IN THERE 
REALLY NICE I LIKE THE FACT THAT THE DINING ROOM EXTENDS INTO THE KITCHEN IT'S GOOD 
OPEN SPACE 
WATER TANK 
AIRING CUPBOARD 
YOU'VE GIVEN HER A DOWNSTAIRS CUPBOARD BUT HAVE YOU GIVEN HER THE DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 
I'VE GIVEN HER A DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 
THE KITCHEN'S PROBABLY SMALLER THAN OURS I'D SAY BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S A KITCHEN DINER AND YOU COULD 
PROBABLY PUT A FRIDGE FREEZER IN THE DINING ROOM POSSIBLY TO MAKE MORE ROOM SPACE HERE 
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF WORK SURFACE 
THE HOUSE IS SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN THEY HAVE CURRENTLY GOT BUT THEY'RE MOVING INTO A MUCH BETTER AREA 
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BOTHER THEM TOO MUCH 
LOOK OH HELLO A CLOAKROOM IT'S A BATHROOM 
ACTUALLY A BATHROOM 
THERE ARE NO CLOAKS IN HERE 
STRAIGHT FROM THE KITCHEN INTO THE BATH THE SKYLIGHT'S AMAZING THAT'S GOOD 
AS LONG AS THERE'S ONE UPSTAIRS AS WELL IT SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT 
HAVE YOU NOTICED THESE CORK DOORS AND WALLS THAT'S MAD 
THE BATHROOM IS SO UNIQUE AND UNUSUAL YOU COULD PROBABLY RUN IT AS A TOURIST ATTRACTION 
NICE 
RIGHT O. K. 
THIS MUST BE LIKE A STUDY 
A BEDROOM WELL YEAH THEY'RE USING IT AS A STUDY 
THEY'RE SAYING STUDY OR BEDROOM 
WE'RE SAYING BATHROOM 
FIREPLACE HEY CHECK OUT THE VIEW FROM HERE THAT'S AMAZING 
WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO LIVE AT THE BOTTOM OF GOLD HILL 
EVERY DAY EVERY DAY HAVING TO GO UP THAT BRILLIANT HILL 
ANOTHER BEDROOM 
GOOD SIZE 
THAT WINDOW IS GOING TO BE SPOTTED VERY QUICKLY 
FANTASTIC VIEW WOW THAT IS REALLY QUITE FANTASTIC 
IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC TO WAKE UP TO HAVING THE BED POSITIONED THERE AND WAKING UP TO 
IT WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE TO BE OUR ROOM 
PICTURE WHAT THEY'RE DOING YOU AND I PUT THE BED IN THAT POSITION SHE 
JUST SAID THEN WAKING UP IN THE MORNING TO THAT VIEW 
I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS WOULD HOUSE MY CLOTHES 
IS THAT YOUR MAIN CONCERN IT IS 
THAT YOU CAN FIT ALL YOUR CLOTHES IN ONE HOUSE 
WELL WE CAN PUT YOURS IN THE SHED 
THIS IS THE SOUND OF LOVE 
THIS IS REALLY COOL THIS IS HUGE 
IS THIS BIGGER THAN OURS 
YOU'VE GOT THE STAIRS COMING UP INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM YES WOW O. K. 
THEY'RE IN THE ATTIC EFFECTIVELY THERE'S BEDS UP THERE LIVING SPACE WHERE'S ALL THE CASH IN THE ATTIC 
STRAIGHT AWAY BECAUSE OF THE DECOR THAT'S HERE ALREADY YOU KNOW THAT JESSICA WOULD LOVE IT 
THIS WOULD DEFINITELY BE HER SORT OF SPACE WOULDN'T IT 
OH WOW COOL IT'S A GOOD SIZE UP HERE 
KIDS HAVE A FASCINATION TO LIVE IN THESE KOOKY LITTLE SPACES DON'T THEY 
KIDS ALWAYS HAVE THIS DESIRE AND AMBITION 
IT FEELS LIKE YEAH I'M LIVING IN A TREE HOUSE ROOM 
YES IT'S A NICE PROPERTY IT'S GOT CHARACTER AND THE THREE BEDROOMS 
THE ONLY THING IS THAT THERE'S NOT ANOTHER BATHROOM 
THEY NEED MY BRILLIANT PROPERTY BRAIN M. M. M. 
GRANT AND EMMA YOU LOVED THE HOUSE BAR ONE THING 
THE DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM THAT'S RIGHT YES 
I WAS GOING TO TRY AND SAY IT'S A GREAT CLOAKROOM BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY WANT A BATHROOM UPSTAIRS AS WELL 
THAT'S RIGHT SO HERE'S THE SOLUTION 
GET RID OF YOUR DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM ENTIRELY THUS OPENING UP A GIGANTIC KITCHEN 
THAT WOULD BE GREAT FOR FAMILY MEALS AND THE KIDS 
YES MAKE A UTILITY AREA AS WELL IT'S THE DREAM 
THEN WHERE WE ARE NOW THIS BECOMES YOUR BATHROOM SO IF WE CAN ALL IMAGINE BATHING IN HERE 
OBVIOUSLY NOT TOGETHER LIKE A RUGBY TEAM JUST INDIVIDUALLY THIS IS THE BATHROOM 
SO THIS HERE BUT THAT LOSES YOU A BEDROOM YEAH 
I CAN GET YOU ANOTHER BEDROOM 
BUT WE NEED TO GO THROUGH HERE AND UPSTAIRS TO SHOW YOU WHERE THAT COULD BE 
O. K. GO THIS WAY ALL RIGHT 
IF YOU COME UP HERE 
THIS YOUR BIG ATTIC ROOM 
THIS THEN BECOMES TWO BEDROOMS RIGHT O. K. 
THEY'RE ONLY SMALL YOUR CHILDREN 
BUT THEY COULD GROW IN HERE AND YOU COULD PUT A WALL UP HERE 
SO THIS ALL BECOMES A STUD WALL AND THEN ONE PERSON GETS THE STAIRS GOING TO THEIR ROOM 
AND THIS IS ANOTHER BEDROOM 
JESSICA WOULD BE ON THIS SIDE AND HOLLY WOULD BE ON THE OTHER SIDE 
YES IT COULD WORK 
THEY DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING SEPARATE ROOMS THEY LIKE TO SHARE 
YES SORT OF SEPARATE BUT TOGETHER THERE YOU GO PERFECT 
SO YOU'VE GOT THREE BEDROOMS A BATHROOM UPSTAIRS AND A GIGANTIC KITCHEN DINER IT IS PERFECT 
WE NEED TO GO AND GUESS THE PRICE THOUGH DON'T WE YUP 
GO DOWNSTAIRS AND WE'LL FIND KRISTIAN O. K. 
BOO SSSH AND THAT NOISE SYMBOLISES GUESS THE PRICE 
EVERY TIME WE SHOW YOU A DELIGHTFUL PROPERTY YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO INDEPENDENTLY FIGHT IT OUT CHEAT 
NOT FIGHT NECESSARILY OR JUST POLITELY GUESS THE VALUE OF EACH PROPERTY 
I AM GOING TO GIVE GRANT THE UPPER HAND BY LETTING HIM GO FIRST 
OWING TO THE VIEWS AND THE LOCATION 
I WOULD HAZARD A GUESS THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY 
THE BUDGET IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SO YOU'RE GOING OVER IT ALREADY YES LOOK AT THE SHAKE OF THE HEAD FROM EMMA 
CONTROVERSIAL 
EMMA HIGHER OR LOWER LOWER 
I'LL GO FOR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
O. K. WELL I KNOW THE PRICE 
THE PRICE OF THIS PROPERTY IS WITH ITS POTENTIAL FOR ALL THOSE THINGS 
TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
NO YOU ARE CLOSEST EMMA 
GOSH REALLY TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND HOW'S THAT IT'S GOOD ISN'T IT 
FORTY GRAND TO SPEND THAT'S GREAT ISN'T IT YEAH THAT'S NUTS 
WILL YOU GET THE SAME REACTION I DON'T KNOW 
NOW IT'S TIME TO VIEW MY HOUSE DO YOU KNOW WHAT LITTLE BIT OF MUSIC HAPPENS NOW 
D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. 
WELL WHAT I'VE GOT 
IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST AESTHETICALLY PLEASING HOUSES EVER TO FEATURE ON TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
ADMITTEDLY KRISTIAN IF WE WERE PLAYING PROPERTY TOP TRUMPS I WOULD WANT THIS FELLOW IN MY HAND 
A COMPLIMENT EDWARD I CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM TO SEE THIS ONE 
ED GRANT AND EMMA HERE WE ARE AT MY CHOICE 
SHE IS A BEAUTY 
NINETEEN TEN SHE WAS CREATED OF THE ARTS AND CRAFTS MOVEMENT 
IT'S BEEN EXTENDED IT'S GOT THE WHIFF OF MODERNITY IN THERE 
IT'S GOT PERIOD FEATURES IT'S A GORGEOUS HOUSE 
THE POTENTIAL THE SPACE I FEEL THAT YOU WANT WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THIS HOUSE KRISTIAN 
IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IT WAS GOING TO EVENTUALLY HAPPEN WASN'T IT 
YOU'VE SEEN IT AND WHAT DID YOU THINK 
I LIKED IT BUT IT WASN'T FOR US I DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT 
WHEN YOU SAY US I HAVEN'T SEEN IT SO YOU HAVE SELFISHLY BEEN GOING OUT HOUSE HUNTING 
AND NOT INVOLVING YOUR OTHER HALF IN THESE RATHER CRUCIAL DECISIONS 
DID YOU TAKE THE CHILDREN WITH YOU I DID AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT 
SO THAT'S THREE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T LIKE THE HOUSE REALLY GRANT'S IRRELEVANT 
I WOULDN'T SAY GRANT'S IRRELEVANT I'D SAY YOU'RE QUITE A FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT PART ONE WOULD THINK SO 
RIGHT YOU'RE NOT REALLY HELPING WHICH IS NICE I HAVE A PROPOSAL 
FROM HERE ON IN EMMA YOU ARE ME I AM YOU I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU ON A TOUR AROUND THIS HOUSE 
YOU ARE DOING THE HEADPHONE SEQUENCES WITH THE NEW ME WHICH IS EMMA AS ME 
SO I'M 
THAT WAY AND WE GO THIS WAY 
RIGHT THIS WAY 
AFTER YOU GRANT IN YOU GO 
THANK YOU EMMA JUST WALK INTO THE SHRUBBERY WITH ME 
THIS COULD BE QUITE INTERESTING THIS 
DO YOU FEEL YOU COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE A HUSBAND AND GAIN A HOUSE 
ARE YOU WORRIED NO NOT REALLY HE'S QUITE PERSUASIVE KRISTIAN 
YES I KNOW BUT I KNOW WHAT HE LIKES AND I KNOW WHAT I SAW 
AND AT THE TIME I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS AN APPROPRIATE HOUSE SHE'S STICKING BY THAT 
LET'S SEE WHETHER KRISTIAN MANAGES TO CHANGE HIS MIND 
PLOUGH RIGHT IN YUP O. K. 
O. K. SO IT'S NOT A BAD SIZED RECEPTION ROOM NO 
ALSO IN EDWARD'S ONE YOU WALK STRAIGHT INTO THE LOUNGE 
HERE HALLWAY THEN LOUNGE YES 
WHAT BAFFLES ME IS THAT THREE PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THIS HOUSE 
YES TWO LITTLE PEOPLE 
TRUE THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT NO 
AND THEN IN HERE IS ANOTHER RECEPTION AREA 
THIS IS A GREAT SIZE THIS IS REALLY NICE 
BUT YOU ARE NOT MEANT TO LIKE THIS EMMA HAS ALREADY SAID YOU WOULDN'T LIKE THIS HOUSE 
SHE DIDN'T EVEN TELL YOU ABOUT IT 
I CAN SEE MYSELF SITTING ON THE COUCH THERE WITH MY FEET UP ON THE TABLE 
IT WOULD SEEM THAT ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS GET GRANT ON HIS OWN JUST TO BE CRUEL TO YOU 
YOU'VE DONE THAT BEFORE 
THAT'S GREAT 
IMAGINE TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY IS ON RIGHT NOW 
I'M ACTUALLY TURNING THE VOLUME UP NOT CHANGING THE CHANNEL IT'S ME 
I HAVE TO SAY YOU LOOK PRETTY DARN GOOD RIGHT NOW 
HE'S TURNING MY HUSBAND AGAINST ME HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN TOGETHER WE'RE GONNA END UP BEING DIVORCED 
ARE YOU SLIGHTLY ANGRY AT EMMA 
I'M NOT ANGRY NO 
SAY YES GO ON SAY YES 
I'M FURIOUS ACTUALLY THAT SHE HASN'T LET ME KNOW THAT SHE HAS SEEN SUCH A NICE SIZED PROPERTY 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WITH GRANT TWENTY YEARS 
AND IN THE SPACE OF TWO MINUTES HE'S TRYING TO CAUSE HUGE RIFTS 
OH MY GOSH IT'S HUGE 
YES THIS IS MASSIVE 
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS IT'S GREAT COFFEE IS AN IMPORTANT THING 
IT IS WHICH IS WHY I'VE GOT THAT READY FOR YOU THERE 
RIGHT FANTASTIC 
AND A LITTLE CAKE NOT THAT I'M TRYING TO BRIBE HIM OR ANYTHING 
NOW I'M FEELING RIGHT AT HOME 
THERE YOU GO CHEERS TO OUR NEW HOME IT'S GOING WELL ISN'T IT 
DO YOU FEEL YOU'VE MADE A BIG MISTAKE IN LIFE BY NOT SHOWING GRANT THIS HOUSE 
LIKE I SAID IT WAS THE FIRST HOUSE I LOOKED AT 
BE HONEST HAVE YOU MADE A MISTAKE 
HAVE YOU MADE A MISTAKE EMMA YES YES 
THIS IS THE FAMILY DINING AREA 
IT'S A GREAT SPACE A RECENT ADD ON 
YOU'VE GOT LOADS OF LIGHTS COMING THROUGH THOSE SKYLIGHTS I'M STUMPED ME TOO ACTUALLY 
SERIOUSLY YEAH 
WHEN YOU LOOKED IN THAT KITCHEN THE FIRST TIME I LIKED THE KITCHEN 
I DID LIKE THE KITCHEN AND THE DINING SPACE BECAUSE IT'S THE KIND OF THING I WANT 
O. K. SO THIS IS THE SMALLEST BEDROOM IN THE HOUSE BUT STILL FOR ONE OF YOUR KIDS MAGNIFIQUE 
IT'S GOT A SINGLE BED IT'S GOT SPACE TO WALK IN AND OUT OF IT'S GOT A CUPBOARD 
IT'S AN APPROPRIATE SIZE 
NOW IF WE TURN LET'S LOOK HERE LOOK DOWN THERE 
THERE IS THE VILLAINESS THE FEMME FATALE 
DO YOU FEEL YOU HAVE BETRAYED GRANT NO BECAUSE AT THE TIME I REALLY DIDN'T THINK THAT THIS HOUSE 
HAVE YOU BETRAYED GRANT 
HAVE YOU BETRAYED GRANT 
O. K. SO THIS IS A NICE ROOM 
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE HERE WE HAVE THE BATHROOM 
O. K. WHITE SUITE BLUE TILES 
IT'S NOT HARMING ANYONE IS IT NO NO 
I JUST THINK BETRAYED IS A STRONG WORD HAVE YOU BETRAYED GRANT 
MAYBE I MADE A MISTAKE IN NOT SHOWING HIM IT 
MAYBE I BETRAYED GRANT IS THE PHRASE YOU'RE SEEKING 
LEAD THE WAY ALL RIGHT ACROSS THIS LOVELY NICE LITTLE STAIRCASE HERE 
THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE HERE 
IT'S NICE TO HAVE A BIT OF A HALLWAY LEADING TO THE BEDROOMS 
AND THEN PLOUGH INTO HERE SECOND BEDROOM O. K. RIGHT 
SO WE'VE GOT A ROOM HERE BIG ENOUGH TO NOT ONLY TAKE DOUBLE BUNK BEDS 
NOT ONE NOT TWO BUT THREE WARDROBES 
LIKE YOU SAID I BROUGHT THE CHILDREN THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT HAVE YOU BETRAYED GRANT 
BETRAYED IS A STRONG WORD HAVE YOU BETRAYED HIM 
THIS IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL IT'S A BIT OF A MYSTERY 
IT WOULD SEEM THAT I'M MORE IN SYNC WITH YOU THAN EMMA 
I MIGHT HAVE MISLED HIM MISLED 
PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT'S ANOTHER WORD FOR BETRAYED I THINK BETRAYED IS TOO STRONG 
WELL THE FINAL ROOM THE MASTER BEDROOM THE BOUDOIR 
AGAIN NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR EMMA 
NO I'M SURPRISED 
HAVE YOU BETRAYED GRANT ED LET IT GO ALL RIGHT 
COME ON YEAH AWESOME 
GREAT SO 
HUGE MASTER BEDROOM YEAH 
GREAT BIG BAY WINDOW HERE LOTS OF LIGHT GETTING IN 
I CAN IMAGINE IT IN THE SUMMER MONTHS BEING SWATHED IN SUNSHINE 
IMAGINE OF A SUMMER'S EVENING YOU COULD OPEN THE WINDOW AND THE HEADY SCENT OF A LILAC PLANT WAFTING IN 
LOOKS LIKE GRANT WILL BE MOVING IN HERE AND I'LL BE STAYING WHERE I AM I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY 
I LIKE EMMA REALLY I THINK SHE'S A GREAT GIRL 
BUT WHY DID SHE NOT SHARE SOMETHING THIS GOOD 
I DON'T KNOW WE NEED TO FIND OUT REALLY 
WELL EMMA THAT'S THE END OF THE TOUR 
I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE ARE AT THE END OF THIS 
NO I MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE 
I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOME RECONCILIATION HERE WE NEED SOME COUNSELLING 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO EMMA 
HONEY I WANT YOU TO FESS UP 
TELL ME WHAT YOU DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THIS HOUSE AND WHY YOU KEPT ALL ITS FANTASTIC SECRETS FROM ME 
YOU GO 
THERE'S NO CLOAKROOM DOWNSTAIRS AND THE GARDEN WAS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER 
THAN I WAS HOPING BOO 
IT'S NOT GONE DOWN WELL WITH THE AUDIENCE 
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THAT 
WELL I HAVE TO SAY THAT BY WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE WE CAME IN 
I THOUGHT THERE WAS PROBABLY NO GARDEN AND IT WAS TINY BUT YOU KNOW 
THERE SEEMS TO BE THE SORT OF SPACE THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR 
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY SCOPE TO GET THAT 
MUCH DESIRED CLOAKROOM DOWNSTAIRS OR DO ANYTHING ELSE 
TO THE HOUSE THAT WOULD MAKE IT JUST RIGHT FOR YOU BUT IT FEELS GOOD 
YES WHEN I FIRST SAW THE HOUSE IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO 
AND IT WAS BEFORE WE WERE SERIOUSLY LOOKING SO I THINK 
DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU LIKE THE HOUSE MORE NOW YES NOW I DO THIS IS GOOD NEWS 
NOW THAT WE'RE MORE SERIOUS 
I THINK A KISS IS IN ORDER YEAH 
I ACTUALLY MEANT ME 
EDWARD I NEED YOU 
JUST BEEN USING THE DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 
HE DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO CONVERT IT THAT'S A TRICK 
NOW I FEEL THAT BOTH OF YOU KNOW THE PRICE OF THIS HOUSE 
AND THEREFORE WHOEVER GOES FIRST WILL GET POSSIBLY THE BENEFIT OF SAYING THE ACTUAL PRICE FIRST 
GRANT THE PRICE OF THIS HOUSE IS 
O. K. I WAS SO FAR OFF THE MARK WITH THE FIRST ONE AND THIS PLACE 
IS SO MUCH BIGGER SO I WILL GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND SAY TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
YOU REALLY DIDN'T KNOW THE PRICE DID YOU EMMA THE PRICE OF THIS HOUSE IS 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
EMMA IS RIGHT 
THAT'S THE PRICE INTERESTING PRICE I'M PLEASED WE HAVE GOT THIS OUT OF OUR SYSTEMS

CAN I JUST LEAVE AS A FRIEND NO THESE TWO ARE FRIENDS WE I'M GOING TO THE WILD CARD THIS WAY 
THE WILD CARD THE WILD CARD DO I NEED TO GO ON NO

IF THEY GO FOR IT WE'LL FIND OUT WHO REALLY WEARS THE TROUSERS 
BANG ON BUDGET AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY GRAND 
OR CAN WE RELY ON THE WILD CARD THAT EVERYONE SIMPLY LOVES 
A NEW BUILD THAT LOOKS LIKE AN OLD HOUSE BUT ISN'T COS IT'S NEW 
CONFUSED AT LEAST THE PRICE IS STRAIGHTFORWARD AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BIG ONES 
GRANT AND EMMA YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO TEST DRIVE 
THE WILD CARD BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES INDEED LOVE THE WILD CARD 
IT IS BEAUTIFUL IT IS LOVELY 
AND WE HAVE HAD OUR MYSTERY TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY SURVEYOR GO ROUND WITH A FINE TOOTH COMB 
IT'S NOT LEGALLY BINDING BUT IT'S A GOOD HEADS UP ABOUT THE PROPERTY AND HE HAS SAID THIS 
HE SAID IT'S A NEW BUILD AND THEREFORE MAKE SURE COS IT'S BEEN BUILT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS 
IT'S STILL GOT ITS NHBC CERTIFICATE AND THEREFORE IT WILL HAVE BEEN BUILT TO MODERN DAY STANDARDS 
HE HAD NOTHING ELSE REALLY TO SAY 
HE STARTED SAYING IT'S GOT A GOOD BOILER IT'S WELL INSULATED 
HE HAD NOTHING REALLY TO SAY BECAUSE IT'S GOOD 
IT'S A POSITIVE PROPERTY SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS 
I WOULD LIKE TO NOW WELCOME YOU TO BEGIN YOUR TEST DRIVE DO WITH IT WHATEVER YOU WISH AND ENJOY

MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT DOES BABY SEBASTIAN THINK

THAT'S A DEAL BREAKER IF EVER I'VE SEEN ONE 
I'VE SEEN A FEW DECENT WAYS TO IMPRESS YOUR NEIGHBOURS IN MY TIME 
AND THIS POSSIBLY ISN'T ONE OF THEM 
IN THE AIR TONIGHT BY PHIL COLLINS 
HOLD ON THAT'S NOT HOW THE REST OF IT GOES 
THIS ISN'T KEEPING UP WITH THE JONESES IT'S KEEPING THE JONESES UP MORE LIKE 
GO ON GIVE IT SOME WELLY 
GRANT AND EMMA IT HAS BEEN AN EMOTIONAL JOURNEY TODAY 
AT THE START OF THE DAY WE FELT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND THEN KRIS AND I TRIED TO LEAVE 
HAVEN'T TOLD YOU THAT BUT WE STAYED WE HUNG IN THERE 
THERE HAVE BEEN TEARS SOME LAUGHTER SPARSELY SPREAD OUT MAINLY TEARS 
YOU'VE SEEN THREE GREAT PROPERTIES WHY ON EARTH DID YOU GO FOR THIS ONE 
BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL THIS HAD A CHANCE AT THE START OF THE SHOW 
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT IS DIFFERENT IT'S MODERN 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE WOULD NORMALLY GO FOR 
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GIVE IT A GO AND SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE 
IT'S A FANTASTIC LOOKING PROPERTY 
IT HAS A REALLY POSITIVE FEEL ABOUT IT AS WELL 
O. K. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS MORE OF AN EMOTIONAL AND INTENSE EXPERIENCE THAN IT HAS ALREADY BEEN 
SO TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
GIVE US THE CRITICAL ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION 
WE ARE REALLY PLEASED WITH THE HOUSE WE DO LIKE IT 
BUT I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO MULL IT OVER A LITTLE BIT LONGER YOU NEED MORE TIME 
I'M NOT THE MOST DECISIVE PERSON SO I DO NEED MORE TIME 
WE COULD MAYBE PUSH THE NEXT SHOW BACK A BIT AND HAVE ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR 
I'VE ALREADY CALLED WE CAN'T DO IT GRANT WHAT DO YOU FEEL 
YEAH IT'S A REALLY NICE HOUSE 
BUT ARE YOU GOING TO BUY IT GRRR 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF THOUGHT FROM BOTH OF US 
THERE'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW 
WE CAN TAKE A NO WE CAN DEAL WITH NO WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE 
NO I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO SAY NO 
BUT IT'S NOT A YES IS IT I THINK IT WILL HAVE TO BE MAYBE 
HAVE TO SETTLE FOR MAYBE I'M FEELING THERE'S MORE POSITIVENESS 
THAN NEGATIVITY SO I CAN LEAVE ON A HIGH 
IT DOES MEAN WE MIGHT HAVE TO MOVE INTO THE HOUSE TOGETHER 
BECAUSE YOU SAID IF THEY DON'T BUY IT WE WILL LET'S GO AND TALK ABOUT IT BYE TAKE CARE 
O. K. BYE 
WOW THAT WAS A TOUGH ONE 
EDWARD PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS BADLY OR IN THE WRONG WAY 
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD MOVE IN TOGETHER RIGHT AWAY OH YOU WANT TO TRY RENTING 
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT AND IF IT WORKS OUT I'LL SUBLET MY APARTMENT 
KRISTIAN IT WILL WORK OUT I'LL PUT EVERYTHING I'VE GOT INTO THIS 
YEAH SEE WE'RE ALL SMILES HERE 
SO THAT'S US SORTED OUT BUT IF YOU'RE AT HOME 
AND YOU CAN'T FIND THE HOUSE OF YOUR DREAMS THEN PLEASE DON'T HESITATE GET IN TOUCH 
WANT TO GO BUY SOME CURTAINS AND FURNITURE WE'VE GOT TO 
THAT SHOP THERE ROMAN BLINDS YEAH
