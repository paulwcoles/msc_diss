AT LAST I'VE COME FACE TO FACE WITH YOU 
A PRIVILEGE GRANTED TO NO OTHER MAN 
AND GRANTED TO YOU TOO LATE 
NOW I HAVE YOU AND I INTEND TO KEEP YOU

HIS THINGS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP 
ADAM ADAMANT TWENTY SIX A ALBANY STREET 
THAT PART OF ALBANY STREET ISN'T EVEN THERE ANY MORE 
MUST BE A HOAX OF SOME KIND 
IN THEORY YOU KNOW IT COULD JUST HAPPEN 
SOME ELEMENTARY FORMS OF LIFE DO GO INTO A SORT OF INDEFINITELY EXTENDED HIBERNATION 
THIS ISN'T AN ELEMENTARY FORM OF LIFE 
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE ADAM ADAMANT 
BUT THERE WAS NEVER ANY CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF HIS DEATH YOU KNOW 
HE JUST DISAPPEARED UNDER MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES 
A LOT OF PEOPLE REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS DEAD 
HE WAS MUCH TOO POPULAR A HERO FOR THEM TO LET GO OF HIM I SUPPOSE 
WELL IF ADAMANT WERE ALIVE HE'D BE LET ME SEE HE'D BE 
NINETY NINE IT'S ABSURD 
HE'S COMING ROUND 
THE KING 
I MUST WARN THE KING 
ALL IN GOOD TIME FIRST OF ALL I MUST ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS 
I'LL TELL YOU NOTHING I'M AFRAID I MUST INSIST 
YOU MAY DO YOUR WORST 
YOU SHALL LEARN THAT 
NO KEY CAN UNLOCK THE LIPS OF ADAM ADAMANT 
OH LOUISE WHAT HAVE YOU 
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU OLD CHAP 
LOUISE SIR JAMES 
THE CRIMEA 
I DON'T NEED YOUR KIND OF HELP 
YOU MAY HELP ME TO MY GRAVE BEFORE I'LL TELL YOU ANYTHING
