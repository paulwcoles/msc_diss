VIENNA BIRTHPLACE OF THE WALTZ 
MOZART BEETHOVEN SCHUBERT AND STRAUSS ALL LIVED HERE 
IT'S STILL A CITY RICH IN MUSICAL TRADITION 
IT'S ALSO THE HOME TO EUROVISION YOUNG MUSICIANS TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
EUROVISION YOUNG MUSICIANS BRINGS TOGETHER SOME OF EUROPE'S 
MOST PROMISING MUSICAL TALENT 
THE EVENT HAS BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF AUSTRIA'S MUSIC CALENDAR 
HELD EVERY TWO YEARS THE COMPETITION OPENS THE VIENNA MUSIC FESTIVAL 
SIXTEEN COMPETITORS ALL UNDER THE AGE OF NINETEEN 
ARRIVED IN VIENNA ON A MISSION TO BE ONE OF THE SEVEN FINALISTS 
STAGED HERE IN THE HEART OF VIENNA THE CITY HALL SQUARE THE CONCERT IS BROADCAST ALL OVER EUROPE 
REPRESENTING THE U. K. IS CHROMATIC HARMONICA PLAYER PHILIP ACHILLE 
IF I GET THROUGH FROM THE SEMIFINAL 
THIS IS WHERE I'LL BE PERFORMING 
IN FRONT OF THIS GIANT STAGE AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION 
PHILIP COULD WALK AWAY WITH A WINNING PRIZE OF FIVE THOUSAND EUROS 
AND THE COVETED TITLE EUROVISION YOUNG MUSICIAN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
DURING ITS TWENTY SIX YEAR HISTORY ONLY ONE BRITON HAS WON THE COMPETITION 
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WAS NATALIE CLEIN'S YEAR 
ALREADY B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
SHE WENT TO ON TO CLAIM THE EUROVISION YOUNG MUSICIANS TITLE 
AN ACHIEVEMENT THAT FIRMLY ESTABLISHED NATALIE ON THE CLASSICAL CIRCUIT 
IT WAS A BIG DEAL 
MY WORLD OPENED UP DEFINITELY 
THAT YEAR NINETY FOUR NO QUESTION ABOUT IT 
SO THAT WAS GREAT AND I GOT KNOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE OUTSIDE OF BRITAIN 
AND AGAIN INVITED TO SOME FESTIVALS AND MET A FEW COLLEAGUES 
SO I'D SAY IT WAS AN EXTENSION OF WHAT HAPPENED IN BRITAIN 
SO COULD PHILIP REPEAT NATALIE'S TRIUMPH IN THIS COMPETITION 
CURRENTLY STUDYING HARMONICA AND SAXOPHONE 
AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MUSIC THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE 
I'M ON THE FIRST YEAR OF MY FOUR YEAR COURSE AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MUSIC 
SO I'M DOING A BACHELOR OF MUSIC COURSE 
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME AT THE MOMENT 
JUST BEING ABLE TO BE SURROUNDED BY LIKE MINDED PEOPLE 
AND BEING IMMERSED IN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND ALL THIS MUSIC 
APART FROM THE HARMONICA PHILIP'S OTHER LOVE IS THE BASS GUITAR 
I HAVE A BAND GOING CALLED THE FRONTIERS 
AND WE TRY TO PLAY WHENEVER WE CAN WHEREVER WE CAN 
AND ERM I LOVE FUNK WHENEVER I PLAY SOMETHING 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT STYLE IT IS EVERY STYLE HAS A GROOVE 
I JUST LIKE TO GROOVE 
THERE ISN'T REALLY A KIND OF STYLE THAT I DON'T LIKE 
I JUST TRY TO GET AS MUCH OF EVERYTHING THAT I CAN 
IT'S BEEN A BUSY FEW YEARS FOR PHILIP 
PLAYING THE CHROMATIC HARMONICA HE RECEIVED THE TABOR FOUNDATION AWARD 
AT THE B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN COMPETITION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
I WAS THE FIRST HARMONICA THEY'D ACTUALLY HAD IN THE COMPETITION 
EVEN THOUGH IT HAD BEEN LISTED FOR SO MANY YEARS 
SO THAT WAS GREAT AS WELL 
AND JUST BEING ABLE TO BRING IT TO THE PEOPLE 
TO PEOPLE THAT HADN'T HEARD IT BEFORE 
IT WAS GOOD TO DO SOMETHING NEW 
IT WAS SPECIAL ENOUGH TO GET TO THE QUARTERFINALS BUT TO GET THE PRIZE 
WAS JUST LIKE 
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ACHIEVEMENT 
SO I WAS JUST REALLY HUMBLE AND GRATEFUL THAT THEY'D CONSIDERED ME 
WORTH THE MONEY THEY GAVE ME 
SO YEAH IT WAS REALLY GOOD 
EVER SINCE HIS LIFE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF HIGHS 
INCLUDING PLAYING AT THE WORLD'S BIGGEST MUSIC FESTIVAL 
THE B. B. C. PROMS 
AS A HARMONICA PLAYER AND SUCH A YOUNG PERSON 
YOU DON'T REALLY GET TO DO THESE KIND OF THINGS 
I WAS VERY LUCKY TO GET THAT 
THE CAPACITY IS IN THE THOUSANDS 
BUT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE PLAYING TO A COUPLE OF HUNDRED PEOPLE 
I REALLY ENJOYED THAT 
I WAS PLAYING A PIECE WRITTEN FOR THE HARMONICA 
BY LARRY ADLER GENEVIEVE 
THE THING ABOUT LARRY ADLER NOT JUST THE FACT HE WAS SUCH A MAGNIFICENT PLAYER 
AND HIS SHOWMANSHIP 
BUT IT WAS THE FACT HE BROUGHT THE HARMONICA TO ENGLAND 
I'M INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL TO HIM 
TO BE PART OF THE NOBLE TRADITION OF THE HARMONICA AS I LIKE TO SAY 
IS SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL 
I STARTED PLAYING THE PIANO WHEN I WAS SIX 
THAT WAS THE FIRST INSTRUMENT I STARTED TO LEARN 
I STARTED TO PLAY THE HARMONICA AND SAXOPHONE WHEN I WAS NINE 
I STARTED THE HARMONICA WITH AN OPEN MIND 
JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
IT'S JUST SORT OF BECOME MY INSTRUMENT 
IT'S A REALLY LOVELY INSTRUMENT 
IF YOU COME TO TERMS WITH IT IT JUST BECOMES ANOTHER PART OF YOU 
THERE'S TWO MAIN TYPES OF HARMONICA 
CHROMATIC THE ONE I PLAY AND DIATONIC 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IF YOU CONSIDER WHAT THE WORDS MEAN 
THE CHROMATIC HARMONICA HAS THE FULL SPECTRUM OF NOTES 
SO IT HAS THREE OCTAVES FORTY EIGHT NOTES THE DIATONIC HARMONICA 
ONLY POSSESSES NOTES WITHIN A GIVEN KEY 
THE REASON WHY I PLAY CHROMATIC IS COS I DO CLASSICAL MUSIC 
IN ORDER TO DO CLASSICAL MUSIC YOU NEED ALL THE NOTES TO BE AVAILABLE 
THE WAY A CHROMATIC HARMONICA IS BASICALLY BUILT 
IS IF YOU THINK OF IT AS TWO LAYERED 
I CAN ACCESS DIFFERENT LAYERS BY PRESSING THE BUTTON 
YOU PROBABLY CAN'T SEE FROM HERE BUT WHEN I PRESS THE BUTTON 
IT BLOCKS OFF ONE LAYER AND REVEALS ANOTHER 
IF I DEMONSTRATE THIS 
IF I PLAY ONE NOTE NORMALLY WITHOUT PRESSING THE BUTTON 
IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS 
THAT'S JUST A C. 
IF I PLAY IN THE SAME HOLE WITH THIS SIDE IN 
ALSO IF I INHALE 
JUST LIKE THAT 
THE THING ABOUT ME AND THE HARMONICA IS THAT 
THERE AREN'T THAT MANY PLAYERS 
I KIND OF HAVE THIS DUTY TO CONTINUE THE TRADITION 
I WANNA MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T DIE OUT 
DOESN'T ENTER THE DARK AGES OF THE HARMONICA 
SO TO VIENNA WHERE PHILIP HOPES THE JUDGES WILL BE AS ENTHUSED 
WITH THE HARMONICA AS HE IS 
BUT WITH THE SEMIFINALS OF EUROVISION YOUNG MUSICIANS UNDERWAY 
HE STILL HAS A BIG DECISION TO MAKE 
WHICH OF HIS TRUSTED HARMONICAS WILL HE CHOOSE 
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY DECIDED YET 
I TAKE TWO ON JUST IN CASE YOU SEE 
I'M JUST WARMING THEM UP NOW TO SEE WHAT MOOD THEY'RE IN 
THAT'LL BASICALLY DICTATE 
WITH MINUTES TO GO THE TENSION IS BUILDING BACKSTAGE 
TRYING TO KEEP COOL UNDER THE PRESSURE 
PHILIP'S THOUGHTS TURN TO THE PERFORMANCE AHEAD 
I TRY NOT TO GET TOO BOGGED DOWN IN THIS WHOLE IDEA OF PERFECTION 
I JUST GO OUT THERE AND GIVE PEOPLE A BIT OF ME 
COS THAT'S THE PART THAT I GIVE PEOPLE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN BEFORE 
THE ACCURACY AND STUFF IS ALL GOOD AND YOU PRACTISE YOUR PIECE 
AND GO OVER IT MANY TIMES BUT ALL THIS IS NOTHING 
AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU GO OUT THERE AND PERFORM AND ENJOY YOURSELF 
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO 
PHILIP HAS DONE ALL HE CAN 
IT'S IN THE HANDS OF THE JUDGES NOW 
WITH THE SEMIFINALS HELD OVER TWO DAYS 
THERE'S AN AGONISING WAIT AHEAD 
WHAT BETTER WAY TO RELAX THAN TAKE IN THE SIGHTS OF VIENNA 
WITH HIS MUM 
MANY OF THE GREAT COMPOSERS LIVED AND WORKED IN VIENNA 
CHOPIN HAYDN MOZART BEETHOVEN 
THEIR LEGACY IS STILL PRESENT IN VARIOUS FORMS IN THE CITY TODAY 
FINALLY THE WAITING'S OVER 
IT'S TIME FOR PHILIP TO FIND OUT HIS FATE 
HAS HE DONE ENOUGH TO MAKE THE FINAL OF THE COMPETITION

SO PHILIP BECOMES ONE OF THE SEVEN CONTESTANTS
