HELLO AGAIN WELCOME TO THE FIRST 
SNOOKER EXTRA OF THE EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP THE FIRST MATCH WE 
WILL FEATURE HAS STEPHEN LEE OF 
ENGLAND WHO HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF 
THE ELITE TOP SIXTEEN FOR ELEVEN SEASONS 
BUT HE IS IN A BIT OF TROUBLE THIS 
SEASON MASTERS RUNNER UP A FEW 
MONTHS BACK BUT UNLESS HE HAS A 
GOOD RUN 
OVER THE 
NEXT FEW 
WEEKS 
HE 
IS IN 
DANGER OF DROPPING OUT HE 
HAS A TOUGH ASSIGNMENT IN ROUND ONE 
HE IS UP AGAINST JOE 
SWAIL WHO 
KNOWS WHAT 
IT IS 
LIKE TO 
IN THIS CHAMPIONSHIP HAVING 
REACHED THE SEMI FINALS ON TWO 
OCCASIONS THIS IS THEIR OPENING 
SESSION TO COME NINE FRAMES IN 
TOTAL 
JOE SWAIL GET THIS FIRST ROUND 
MATCH UNDER WAY HE HAS HAD A 
TREMENDOUS RECORD HERE AT THE 
CRUCIBLE WORLD RANKING SEVENTEEN JOE 
SWAIL AS I SAY HE HAS GOT A 
RECORD AND THIS THEATRE REALLY 
BRINGS OUT THE BEST IN HIM THE 
LAST TIME WE SAW STEPHEN LEE HE 
WAS IN THE FINAL AT THE MASTERS 
WHERE HE LOST OUT TO MARK SELBY 
RANKED NUMBER THIRTEEN IN THE WORLD SO A 
CLOSE ONE ON PAPER 
NOT THE NICEST SHOT TO HAVE FOR 
STEPHEN LEE TO GET HIMSELF GOING A 
BIT OF DANGER IT HASN'T COME OUT 
TOO BAD BUT JOE SWAIL HAS A LEFT IN 
THE RED CENTRE 
THAT HAS GIVEN JOE SWAIL FIRST 
OPPORTUNITY IN THIS MATCH 
THERE IS 
THE UNUSUAL CUEING ACTION OF JOE 
SWAIL JUST HIT SLIGHTLY ACROSS THE 
BALL 
EARLY MATCH NERVES RATHER THAN THE 
CUE ACTION ABSOLUTELY IF YOU JUST 
ABSOLUTELY IF YOU JUST DON'T PUSH THE CUE THROUGH ENOUGH 
YOU PUT ON UNINTENTIONAL SIDE L. THINK THAT IS WHAT HE DID 
WE HAVE TALKED LONG AND HARD ABOUT 
HIS UNUSUAL CUEING ACTION AND I 
SUPPOSE WE HAVE THE TWO OPPOSITE 
HERE STEPHEN LEE HAS ONE OF THE 
BEST CUE ACTIONS IN THE GAME 
IF HE GETS IT AND GET A GOOD KISS 
ON THE RED IT COULD BE IN HIS 
FAVOUR BOTH PLAYERS WILL TAKE 
LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO GET USED TO 
THE SPEED OF THE TABLE AND THE 
THROW OFF THE CUSHIONS TABLES HERE 
ALWAYS PLAYED DIFFERENTLY TO THE 
PRACTICE TABLE IS THAT WE HAVE 
BACKSTAGE PLUS THERE IS A BIT MORE 
ATTENTION OUT THERE THAN ON THE 
PRACTICE TABLE 
THAT WAS A TRICKY ONE 
PLAYED IT 
NICELY HE HAS BROUGHT ANOTHER 
COUPLE OF REDS INTO PLAY NOW THIS 
IS A CHANCE VERY NICELY PLAYED 
HERE FROM STEPHEN TALKING ABOUT 
THE TENSION AND THERE IS JUST 
TENSION IN THE AIR WHEN YOU ARRIVE 
AT THE CRUCIBLE THAT FEELING ABOUT 
THIS TOURNAMENT IS SOMETHING 
SPECIAL A MARVELLOUS ARENA FOR 
SNOOKER 
IT IS SOMETHING SPECIAL SNOOKER IT IS WHERE REPUTATIONS ARE MADE 
AND LOST IT IS THE LAST EVENT OF 
THE SEASON IF YOU LEAVE HERE 
PLAYING POORLY YOU HAVE 
A LONG 
WAIT FOR YOUR NEXT MATCH 
WHEN STEPHEN LEE PLAYED MARK SELBY 
LAST YEAR HE LOOKED VERY 
IMPRESSIVE HE LOST HEAVILY IN THE 
END BUT HE IS A CLASS PLAYER AS HE 
SHOWED IN THE MASTERS JOHN WAS 
TALKING ABOUT HIS CUE ACTION AND 
OF COURSE THERE IS QUITE A NUMBER 
OF THINGS THAT MAKE UP THE CUE 
ACTION LYING IS VERY IMPORTANT 
AND STEPHEN IS EXCELLENT THE 
LINE HE HAS GOT A LOT OF GOOD 
THINGS IN HIS FAVOUR IT IS JUST A 
MATTER OF CAN HE RETAIN THAT WHEN 
HE IS OUT THERE UNDER EXTREME 
PRESSURE IN THE LAST FEW SEASONS 
WE HAVE NOT REALLY SEEN HIM DO SO 
HE HAS SETTLED FOR THE RED TO THE 
LEFT MIDDLE 
THAT IS FINE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT STEPHEN LEE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR 
GETTING HIMSELF SETTLED DOWN 
THIS IS HIS FIRST REAL GOOD CHANCE 
AND HE IS MAKING A GOOD JOB OF IT 
WE SAY IT SO MANY TIMES IT IS 
LOVELY TO GET YOUR HAND ON THE 
TABLE AND GET THE FIRST FRAME UNDER 
YOUR BELT THAT IS THE CASE NOW 
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF A CENTURY 
BREAK 
NOT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BLACK HE 
WILL DO WELL TO GET POSITION ON 
THIS LAST AWKWARD RED IT DOESN'T 
MATTER FRAME OVER BUT WE WON'T BE 
SEEING A CENTURY 
WHAT AN EFFORT THAT WAS THAT JUST 
SHOWS YOU THE CUE POWER THAT WAS A 
BRILLIANT EFFORT AND A CHANCE OF 
POTTING THIS RED NO JUST GOT THE TOP JOB BUT IT IS 
A MARVELLOUS START THE STEPHEN LEE 
JOE SWAIL MISSED AN EASY GREEN 
STEPHEN LEE DID THE REST 
SOMEHOW IT HAS GOT BETWEEN THE GAP 
OF YELLOW AND BLUE AND CHANCE 
FOR JOE SWAIL 
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT 
HE HAS NOT POTTED A BALL FOR NEARLY 
EIGHTEEN MINUTES AND THIS WAS NOT THE 
EASIEST ONE TO GET STARTED IF HE 
MISSED THAT HE WAS DEFINITELY 
GOING TO LEAVE SOMETHING ON 
WE SPOKE ABOUT HIS UNORTHODOX CUE 
ACTION HIS POSITIONAL PLAY IS ON 
ORTHODOX IN GENERAL THERE IS A 
NORMAL WHERE YOU WOULD MAKE YOUR 
BREAKS BUT JOE PLACE A LOT OF DRAG 
SHOTS WHICH TAKES THE BALL VERY 
SLOWLY USING BACK SPIN CAN BE VERY 
STRONG IN HIS DAY A LOT BETTER 
THAN HIS RANKING HAS SAID HE HAS 
DONE HE HAS A CHANCE OF THE TOP SIXTEEN 
BUT HE WILL HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD RUN 
HERE HE IS TAKING HIS TIME THAT WAS A TRICKY ONE WITH THE REST 
IT IS O. K. AT THE MOMENT TO BE EITHER 
SIDE OF THE BLUE BECAUSE THERE IS 
A RED AVAILABLE FROM NOW ON HE 
WILL HAVE TO PLAY COULD PRECISE 
POSITION GOOD PRECISE POSITION 
NOT QUITE AS PLAYED WE SEE THAT A 
LOT OF TIMES YOU GET BLACK LIKE 
THAT AND IF HE WAS IN THE SNOOKER 
CLUB PRACTISING 
HE WOULD 
PUT A 
TRACE OF SIDE ON 
JUST AS 
WHEN 
ROUND BUT HERE 
AT THE 
CRUCIBLE YOU 
HAVE TO 
MAKE SURE 
OF THE 
POT AND 
THAT IS 
HOW YOU RUN OUT OF POSITION 
AND 
THE THINNER ON THE 
BLACK THE MORE TERRIFYING IT IS TO 
PLAY IT WITH SIDE THE THOUGHT OF 
MISSING THE BLACK IS ENOUGH TO 
TWITCH IT NOTHING WRONG IN TAKING 
THE CHANCE WHAT YOU HAVE GOT TO DO 
IS POT THE BALL 
ALL THE 
TIME AND 
SOMETIMES YOU 
HAVE TO SACRIFICE A 
BE TOUGH POSITION BIT OF 
POSITION 
ALMOST WENT WRONG HE SLIGHTLY OVER 
SCREWED THAT HE PLAYED FOR THE RED 
STRAIGHT INTO THE RIGHT HAND POCKET 
YOU CAN SEE HOW QUICKLY THE CUE 
BALL REACTED TO THE BACKS GIVE 
BACKSPIN OFF THE CUE EXCELLENT 
RECOVERY HE NEEDED THIS STEPHEN 
LEE WAS SO STRONG IN THE FIRST 
FRAME 
THERE IS A FEW REDS HE CAN FRAME PLAY PERSONALLY I WOULD LIKE TO 
TRY AND GET THE CUE BALL WELL I 
HAVE PUT A CIRCLE WHERE AND THAT 
IS JUST ABOUT PERFECT HE JUST 
MISSED THE CIRCLE THOSE TWO REDS 
AVAILABLE INTO THE LEFT MIDDLE AND 
THAT POSITIONAL SHOT SHOULD BE THE 
FRAME WINNER 
A VERY CLEVER CANNON HE BROUGHT 
ANOTHER RED INTO PLAY THE PINK 
INTO PLAY JUST NEEDS THE RED HE DIDN'T INTEND TO CANNON THE PINK 
BARRING SNOOKERS JOE SWAIL LOOKS 
LIKE HE HAS LEVELLED THE SWANN 
THIS ONE FRAME CONCEDED 
HE HAS BEEN FORTUNATE THERE HE DID 
NOT PLAYED TO CANNON THAT RED 
HE HAS NOT REALLY GOT A POT ON AND 
SAFETY IS NOT EASY EITHER 
HE HAS NOT FINISHED WELL ON THE 
BLUE AND MAY HAVE TO PLAY THE GREEN THAT WAS A VERY THIN CUT EXCELLENT 
HE HAS A GOOD CHANCE HERE IT IS A 
REWARD FOR TWO EXCELLENT SHOT 
SHOTS 
HE COULD NOT WISH FOR A BETTER 
CHANCE THAN THIS PLENTY OF REDS IN 
THE OPEN AND THE BLACK AVAILABLE 
HE IS TAKING HIS TIME HERE TO GET 
IN AND AROUND THE BLACK AND THAT 
IS THE QUICK WAY TO WIN THE FRAME 
RATHER THAN COMING UP FOR BLUE 
A BAD CONTACT THERE BUT AT LEAST IT 
DID NOT KNOCK THE RED OFF LINE 
IT STOPPED THE CUE BALL RUNNING 
THROUGH FOR HIS INTENDED COLOUR 
LIGHT IN THE CORNER BUT HE MAY BE 
ON THE PINK 
I WAS COMMENTATING ON THIS TABLE 
THIS MORNING AND THERE WERE ACUTE 
BAD CONTACT THEM A FEW BAD 
CONTACT US THEN 
I CAME INTO THE CRUCIBLE YESTERDAY 
AMOUNTED NOT LOOK AS THOUGH THEY 
WOULD GET IT READY FOR PLAY THEY 
ALWAYS DO A GOOD CHALK AS USUAL 
IT IS PERFECTLY SET OUT READY FOR 
THE PLAYERS TO COME IN 
THE SET UP WILL ALWAYS CAUSE A 
LITTLE BIT OF PROBLEM FOR THE 
TABLES 
THE HEAT GENERATED BY THE PEOPLE 
COMING IN WORLD CAUSED THE CLOTH TO 
SWEPT UP WILL CAUSE THE CLOTH 
HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET INTO A 
POSITION WHERE HE CAN ROLL ONE OF 
THESE REDS AND GET IN FOR THE BLACK 
THAT WILL BE THE DECIDER FOR THIS 
FRAME IT COULD HAVE GONE WRONG 
BECAUSE HE COULD HAVE HIT THE PINK 
FULL FACE 
A GOOD STANDARD IN THE FIRST FRAME 
STEPHEN LEE HAD BREAK OF NINETY SIX IN 
THE LAST ONE JOE SWAIL HAD BREAK OF SEVENTY FIVE 
HE IS LOOKING FOR ONE MORE RED HE COULD HAVE PLAYED THAT AND LOT BETTER FIFTY EIGHT POINTS IN IT 
IT IS A GOOD LEAD BUT NOT A FRAME 
WINNING ONE JUST YET STEPHEN LEE NODS HE HAS HAD ENOUGH 
A VERY GOOD SHOT BUT VERY UNLUCKY 
SOMETIMES THE BALLS JUST DO NOT 
RUN RIGHT THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT 
SHOT AND HE COULD NOT HAVE COME IN 
A WORSE POSITION 
A GOOD ATTEND BUT CAN HE GET 
THROUGH TO ONE IT IS VERY TIGHT 
EVEN IF HE CAN POT IT IT IS NOT 
GOING TO BE EASY TO GET OUT 
CAN HE 
HIT ENOUGH OF IT HE HAS LOOKED AT 
THE POTTING ANGLE HE WILL HAVE TO 
PLAY IT WITH A LOT OF PACE 
THAT WAS A RISKY I DO NOT THINK HE 
COULD HAVE EXPECTED TO HAVE THE CUE 
BALL RUNNING THAT FAR IN TO THE 
BAULK END 
STEPHEN LEE IS NORMALLY VERY ASTUTE 
WITH HIS SHOT SELECTION A VERY 
CLEVER PLAYER 
HE HAD TO PLAY IT WITH A BIT OF 
PACE TO BRING THE CUE BALL OUT FOR 
THE PINK AND HE ACHIEVED UP HE 
ACHIEVED THAT 
IT YOU CAN CLINCH YOUR CHANCE 
TOWARDS THE END OF SCRAPPY FRAME IT IS VERY GOOD FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE 
STEPHEN LEE HAS ASKED FOR THE CUE 
BALL TO BE CLEANED SO HE MUST HAVE 
THOUGHT THERE WAS A BAD CONTACT 
HE PLAYED FOR THE BLACK BUT HE BUT 
LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE ANGLE TO TRY 
TO GET CLOSE THIRD TO THAT RED 
CLOSER TO THAT RED 
BUT IS VERY GOOD IT WILL BE VERY 
AWKWARD FOR CHOSE WHALE JOE 
SWAIL 
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN SEE 
HE COULD COME OFF THE LEFT HAND 
SIDE OF THE TABLE BUT THE BLUE IS 
IN THE WAY IF YOU PLAY IT WITH 
PACE IF HE MISSED IT EVERY CHANCE 
HE COULD LEAVE A FREE BALL 
NOW THAT THE REFEREE HAS CALLED A 
MISS HE WILL KEEP CALLING IT UNTIL 
HE HITS IT 
DO YOU LIKE THE MISS 
RULE I LOVE IT 
FOUL AND A MISS STEPHEN STEPHEN WAS JUST WAITING TO SEE IF THERE 
WAS A POSSIBILITY OF FREE BALL 
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE REFEREE 
GET HIS CUE BALL EXACTLY BACK WHERE 
IT WANTS L. DO NOT THINK IT WAS LAST TIME 
FOUL AND A MISS 
FREE BALL 
IS THE KEY HOW COSTLY KEYS OF IT 
HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED THE NATURE 
OF THE FRAME HOW COSTLY THESE 
HALF 
HE HAS HIT IT 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY 
NOW HE IS IN A SITUATION WHERE 
STEPHEN LEE JUST NEEDS THIS RED AND 
A COLOUR AND WE WILL BE ALL SQUARE 
AT THE MID SESSION INTERVAL 
OH WELL IT HAS NOT COST HIM THE 
FRAME YET L. EXPECTED STEPHEN LEE TO MAKE THAT 
THAT COULD BE HANDY FOR JUST AS 
WELL HE APOLOGISED HIS TO STEPHEN 
LEE THAT COULD BE HANDY FOR JOE 
SWAIL HE APOLOGISES 
CAN HE POT THE YELLOW AND HOLD FOR 
THE GREEN THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THE 
BLUE 
HE NEEDS TO DISLODGE THE BLUE 
UNLUCKY JUST NEEDED TO CATCH IT LITTLE BIT THINNER FROM THE CUSHION 
THIS IS A TOUGH CALL 
WHEN YOU HAVE 
A CHANCE TO CLEAR UP TO CLINCH THE 
FRAME YOU'RE ALWAYS TEMPTED TO DO 
IT 
I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE TO 
TURNED THE POT DOWN 
IT IS A BIG 
FRAME NOW BOTH PLAYERS HAVE HAD 
CHANCES WE ARE COMING UP TO THE 
THIRTY SEVENTH MINUTE OF THIS FRAME 
WA I 
TO TWO YEARS TO 
TRY AND COME BACK TO WHERE WE ARE 
NOW 
AND THEY ARE NOT ALONE ESTATE NOW AGENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE 
ALREADY BEGUN TO TAKE DRASTIC

NEW REPORT 
AFTER THE PLAYING POOR POSITIONAL SHOT 
WORMS AND VIRUSES FLOATING 
AROUND A 
BEING USED BY CRIMINAL GANGS 
AM CERTAIN JOE SWAIL WAS HAVE THINKING 
YOU 
THIS EVER DONE SOME IS THING MY FRAME BUT 
EMBARRASSING THE HAVE 
HAVE GOT TO 
LATER 
AND 
HE DOES 
LOOK AS THOUGH HE IS 
AND HE DOES LOOK AS THOUGH HE IS SUFFERING BLUE AND PINK NEEDED 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT HE ONLY NEEDED THE PINK JOE 
SWAIL INTERESTED HE LOOKED LIKE A 
NEAR CAT THEN STEPHEN SHOULD HAVE 
JUST ROLLED IT IN YOU COULD HAVE 
FINISHED ANYWHERE AND BEEN ON THE 
PINK TO SNOOKER YOURSELF UNFORGIVABLE 
YOU CAN SEE HIM HAVING A LOOK AT 
THE ANGLE HE WANTS THE 
CUE BALL TO 
HIT THE 
PINK HE 
HIT THE PINK HE CAN EITHER DROP IT DEAD WAIT AND KNOCK THE PINK ON THE SIDE 
CUSHION OR 
TRY 
TO PUT 
SOME DISTANCE 
BETWEEN THE 
TWO BALLS 
THOSE ARE THE CHOICES 
HE ESCAPED FROM THE SNOOKER NICELY 
HE WILL BE KICKING HIMSELF WHAT 
CHANCE HE HAS LET GO THERE JUST 
THREE POINTS IN IT WILL HE GET A 
BETTER CHANCE THAN THAT 
HE COULD HAVE ROLLED IT IN HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT CLOSE TO THE 
PINK THE 
PINK WAS EASY PINK FOR 
THE FRAME 
HE DID TAKE IT ON BUT HE EDGED ON 
THE THIN SIDE 
HE DIDN'T HIT THAT CORRECTLY BUT 
THE KISS ON THE BLACK GOT HIM A 
SNOOKER 
THAT WAS A GOOD ATTEMPT HE IS ONLY 
A FOOT SHOT HE WAS TRYING TO GET 
IT DEAD WEIGHT HE IS SIX AWAY 
BUT JOE SWAIL ONLY NEEDS THE PINK 
TO WIN FOUL AND A MISS 
IF HE DOESN'T HIT IT THIS TIME 
STEPHEN LEE WILL NEED SNOOKER HE 
IS CERTAIN 
TO 
HIT IT 
THIS 
WAY BUT 
CAN HE GET THE PINK SAFE WHAT 
FRAME HE THREW AWAY THERE STEPHEN 
LEE IT LOOKED AN ABSOLUTE 
CERTAINTY SNOOKERED HIMSELF ON THE 
PINK JOE SWAIL YOU HAVE GOT GIFT THERE 
WHAT A SHOT THAT WAS THE POT WAS 
DIFFICULT 
WITHOUT HAVING TO 
PLAY IT 
AT 
THAT PACE 
TO SCREW BACK FOR THE 
AT THAT PACE TO SCREW BACK FOR THE BLACK 
A FRACTION SHORT FOR THESE REDS IN 
THE LEFT CENTRE 
THAT IS THE TROUBLE WITH THAT SHOT 
IF YOU ARE NOT LOW DOWN AS WE 
COLLET GIVING YOURSELF A NICE 
ANGLE TO COME ON TO THESE REDS YOU 
ARE GIVING YOURSELF THEN MISSABLE 
SHOT 
WHEN YOU HAVE LOST POSITION AND 
LEFT YOURSELF ON THESE REDS THEY 
ARE NOT SO EASY 
HE IS JUST 
SLIGHTLY HAMPERED 
JUST WHITTLING AWAY AT JOE SWAIL 
LEAD ANYTHING BUT DEAD STRAIGHT 
HE TRIED THE CANNON DON'T SEE THE 
VALUE IN THAT O. K. HE CAN POT THE RED ALONG THE TOP CUSHION 
BUT HE 
CANNOT 
GET THE 
CUE 
BALL OUT 
INTO 
THE TABLE FOR PINK OR BLACK IF HE 
GOES FOR THE RED I THINK HE IS 
ONLY GOING TO GO FOR THE ONE ONE 
POINT 
HE IS POINTING AS THOUGH HE HAD A 
BAD CONTACT BUT I AM 
NOT SURE 
HE 
SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR 
THAT RED 
CAN SEE THE 
CUE BALL 
JUMPING WHEN 
HE MADE CONTACT IT IS A TOUGH 
ASKED TO POT THE RED AT PACE AND 
GET OUT FOR A COLOUR NOW 
HE HAS 
LEFT JOE SWAIL GOOD CHANCE 
A LITTLE BIT MORE PRESSURE ON THE 
PINK THAN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON 
THE BLACK 
HE TRIED TO DISTURB IT THEN IF HE 
TRIED TO DISTURB IT ONE SHOULD SAY 
HE SHOULD HAVE GOT THE CANNON IT 
WASN'T DIFFICULT ONCE HE MADE THE 
DECISION TO POT ONE RED AND DISTURB 
THE OTHER IT WAS QUITE UNEASY 
CANNON AN EASY CANNON NOW HE 
HAS SACRIFICED POSITION ON COLOUR 
AND THE RED IS IN AN AWKWARD 
POSITION TOUGH TO WIN THE FRAME AT 
THIS VISIT NOW 
HE HAS PLAYED THE 
BLUE IN SUCH A WAY 
HE MUST BE 
HOPING TO GO FOR THIS RED 
IF IT WAS DEAD STRAIGHT THAT WOULD 
HAS BEEN EASIER GOOD POT THAT RED 
WAS CERTAINLY HOPING AS IT WENT IN 
THE POCKET CHOICES NOW FOR JOE 
SWAIL HE HAS A BLUE WHICH IS A 
DIFFICULT POT JIMMY IT LOOKS AS IF 
THE CUE BALL WILL BE GOING VERY 
NEAR 
THE GREEN 
IF HE TAKES THE BLUE 
NEAR THE GREEN IF HE TAKES THE BLUE ON TO ME 
THAT IS WELL PLAYED HE JUST MISSED 
THE GREEN A GOOD CHANCE JOHN ANY ANY HARDER AND HE WOULD HAVE KISSED THE 
GREEN 
THE REASON HE DID THAT HE NOW JUST 
NEEDS GREEN AND BROWN FOREHEAD TWO 
FRAME ADVANTAGE FOR HER TO FRAME 
ADVANTAGE MADE THAT ONE LOOK EASY 
THAT IS THE BALL THAT COUNT JOE 
SWAIL WAS GIVEN A LIFELINE IN THE 
PREVIOUS FRAME AND ANOTHER ONE 
HERE STEPHEN LEE PLAYED 
ALONG THE CUSHION HAD BAD CONTACT HE HAS DONE THE JOB 
THAT IS ENOUGH TO TAKE JOE SWAIL IN 
FRONT HE NOW LEADS FOUR TWO 
BOTH PLAYERS HAVE HAD A CHANCE IN 
THIS FRAME POSITION HAS GONE 
ASTRAY 
HE HAS HAD A LOOK AT POSSIBLE 
ESCAPES BUT IT LOOKS LIKE LARGE 
PROBLEM LOOMING HE HAS TO BE 
DESPERATE TO BE LOOKING AT THE 
PLANT 
VERY DESPERATE HE WOULD PLANT HAVE TO MAKE IT AND HE WOULD BE 
CAREERING INTO THE OTHER REDS 
HE HAS NOT COME OUT TOO BADLY 
STEPHEN LEE HAVING A BIT OF FUN 
THERE AND SAYING WHAT SHALL I DO 
HERE HE HAS HAD A BASH UP THE REDS 
AND LEFT HIM WITH NOTHING STEPHEN STEPHEN WILL BE THINKING ABOUT THAT FIFTH 
GAME WHEN HE WAS PERFECT ON THE 
BLUE AND SNOOKERED HIMSELF ON THE 
PINK HE HAS TO START THINKING A 
LITTLE BIT MORE POSITIVELY NOW 
STEPHEN LEE HAS HAD HIS CHANCES 
AFTER THAT FIFTH FRAME THE TWO LOST 
THAT HE'D LOST HE JUST LOOKS 
UNSETTLED OUT THERE 
SOMETIMES THE BALLS DO NOT FOR GIVE 
YOU YOU HAVE CAUGHT COLD AND 
OPPORTUNITIES AND YOU DO NOT TAKE 
THEM AND THEN THEY RUN FOR THE 
OTHER MAN 
I THINK YOU JUST SEE 
ABOVE RUN OF THE BALLS WHEN THINGS 
ARE GOING AGAINST YOU YOU DO GET 
BAD RUNNING IT IS JUST THAT IT IS 
ALL EXAGGERATED IN THE MIND 
THAT IS THE TEST OUT THERE THEY 
CAN ALL PLAY WELL 
IF THAT IS 
CORRECT IT IS WHEN YOU CAN PLAY 
AFTER YOU HAVE HAD A SHOCK TO THE 
SYSTEM AND THINGS ARE NOT GOING 
WELL 
HE JUST ABOUT GOT ENOUGH ON THE CUE 
BALL TO BRING IT FROM THE SIDE 
CUSHION 
HE PLAYED TO HOLD FOR THE RED INTO 
THE CENTRE BUT HE WAS ASKING LOT 
THIS IS WHY YOU CANNOT COMPARE THE 
GAME ON THE PRACTICE TABLE AND THE 
MATCH TABLE ON THE PRACTICE TABLE 
HE WOULD HAVE PLAYED IT WITH A 
TRACE OF SIDE AND RUN INTO THE REDS 
BUT HE CANNOT DO THAT IN THE MATCH 
HE WAS FORTUNATE THAT THAT RED JUST 
GOES 
AND NOW A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO 
CLINCH ANOTHER FRAME 
A POOR POSITIONAL SHOT THERE I'M 
NOT SURE IF HE HAD BAD CONTACT 
HE KEEPS SHAKING HIS HEAD STILL FIFTY TWO 
POINTS IN FRONT WITH JUST FIFTY NINE 
AVAILABLE 
THAT WAS THE RED THAT JOE SWAIL 
NEEDED TO CLINCH THE FRAME SO IT 
WAS A CHANCE MISSED 
ONE HECK OF A SHOT AND HE IS NICELY 
ON THE BLACK 
WELL WELL I DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO 
MISS THAT ONE AFTER SUCH A GREAT 
OPENING RED HAD GIVEN HIM A CHANCE 
TO CLINCH THIS FRAME 
STEPHEN LEE HAS HAD A NUMBER OF 
CHANCES IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR 
FRAMES NO BETTER ONE THAN IN HIS 
LAST VISIT REALLY HE GOT HIM WITH 
A GOOD RED AND HAD A CHANCE TO 
CLEAR UP 
JOE SWAIL HAS CLEARED UP AND THAT 
IS HIS FOURTH FRAME ON THE SPIN 
IT IS ALL GETTING A LITTLE BIT 
RAGGED KNOW FOR STEPHEN AS HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN THE WAY IN THIS GAME 
WHEN YOU MISS WHEN THE BALLS ON 
NOT RUNNING FOR YOU IF YOU LEAVE 
AN EASY ONE FOR YOUR OPPONENT BUT 
JOE SWAIL HAS NOT PLAYED IN GOOD 
SHOT THERE 
I AM NOT SURE IF HE PLAYED FOR BUT 
BUT IT HAS TURNED OUT O. K. EIGHTY FOUR THAT 
PLAYED FOR THAT 
HE HAS A GOOD ANGLE TO POT THE RED 
AND SPLIT A FEW MORE OUT 
THERE IS NOTHING MUCH AVAILABLE IN 
THAT PACK OF REDS 
HE IS A BIT CLOSE TO THE RED WHICH 
MAKES IT AWKWARD 
HE MAY HAVE TO USE THE SPIDER IN 
ORDER TO GET SOME BACK SPIN ON TO 
HOLD FOR THE BLACK THE RED IN THE 
LEFT CENTRE IS AWKWARD WHAT GREAT SHOT THAT WAS 
HE SAID EARLIER THE TYPE OF POT 
BUT HE CAN PULL OUT AND THAT WAS 
ONE OF THEM BUT HE MISSED THAT BY 
A LONG WAY 
BECAUSE HE MISSED IT ON THE THIN 
SIDE THE CUE BALL HAS RUN THAT BIT 
FURTHER AND LEFT STEPHEN LEE WITH 
NOTHING TO GO AT 
UNDER IT IS GOOD SAFETY FROM JOE 
SWAIL WITH AWKWARD CUEING 
THE OTHER MATCH HAS FINISHED FIRST 
SESSION AND THE WALK IS GOING UP 
AND THESE TWO HAVE THE WHOLE ARENA 
TO THEMSELVES OH DEAR ME IT NEVER 
RAINS BUT IT POURS UNLUCKY 
HE HE COULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS HE IS HAVING A LOOK AT THIS LONG 
STRAIGHT RED INTO THE LEFT HAND 
CORNER 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT SHOT 
AT ANY TIME BUT AT THIS MOMENT 
WITH STEPHEN LEE STRUGGLING HEAD 
THERE HE ABSOLUTELY HIT THAT 
PERFECT 
HE COULD HAVE DONE WHAT WILL BIT 
MORE RUN ON THAT CUE BALL DONE 
WITH BIT MORE RUN 
A CHANCE AGAIN FOR STEPHEN LEE TO 
PINCH THE FRAME HE CAME TO THE 
TABLE FIFTY ONE POINTS BEHIND IN THE 
PREVIOUS FRAME HE HAD A SIMILAR 
CHANCE AND DID NOT TAKE IT IF HE 
WERE TO GET IT AT SIX TO THREE IS NOT THE 
END OF THE WORLD 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE HE IS ON 
THE BLACK COLOUR THINK THIS RED 
WITH THE BLUE IS AVAILABLE JUST A TOUCH OF DESPERATION THERE 
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER PLAYING 
FOR GOOD SAFETY OR BRINGING THE 
BLUE INTO PLAY BUT I THINK HE HAS 
CLOCKED PATIENT WITH HIMSELF 
STEPHEN LEE THEY SAY IN THE 
CRUCIBLE THE HARDEST PLACE OF ALL 
IS IN THE CHAIR AND STEPHEN LEE HAS 
FAILED IN THAT DEPARTMENT TODAY 
YES I THINK HE HAS LOST IT A 
LITTLE BED LITTLE BIT 
TO APPEASE AND STEPHEN LEE PERFECT 
ON THE BLUE JUST NEEDED BLUE AND 
PINK HE SOMEHOW CONTRIVED TO 
SNOOKER HIMSELF ON THE PINK AND HAS 
NOT WON FRAME SINCE THEN 
LEE SHAKES HIS HAND HE CAN STILL 
SMILE JOE SWAIL I DO NOT THINK HE 
CAN BELIEVE THE SCORE LINE 
ANOTHER UNHAPPY DAY AT THE OFFICE 
FOR STEPHEN LEE L. AM SURE JOE 
SWAIL IS PRETTY CHUFFED WITH HIS 
EFFORTS OUR COVERAGE BEGINS AGAIN 
AT ONE P. M. THIS AFTERNOON FROM TEN A M. 
VIA YOUR RED BUTTON YOU WILL GET 
THE MORNING SESSION
