CARIBBEAN ISLAND RADIO 
GOOD MORNING TO THE CARIBBEAN 
FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO WORK OUTDOORS SUNRISE IS THE START OF THEIR DAY 
BEFORE IT GETS TOO HOT HAULING IN THE CATCH IN THE COOLER MORNINGS 
THERE ARE LOTS OF JOBS TO BE DONE 
TENDING TO CROPS ON SMALL PLOTS OF LAND 
DOMINICA IS SO GREEN AND FERTILE 
THAT AGRICULTURE ALSO TAKES PLACE ON A LARGE SCALE BANANAS AND CITRUS 
THAT'S FRUITS LIKE ORANGES AND GRAPEFRUITS 
ARE ONE OF DOMINICA'S MAIN EXPORT CROPS 
A BIG HELLO TO THE FERREIRA FAMILY 
WHEN THE GRAPEFRUIT CROP IS RIPE 
THEY COME TO THEIR FARM WITH THE WORKERS TO HARVEST IT 
I'M CHERESE FERREIRA MY PARENTS OWN THIS LAND SOMETIMES I HELP OUT 
THE LAYOU VALLEY IN DOMINICA IS FAMOUS IN CITRUS AND BANANAS 
CITRUS IS THE NAME GIVEN TO FRUITS LIKE ORANGES LIMES TANGERINES 
MANDARINS AND GRAPEFRUITS 
I'M CLEMENT CATO FERREIRA 
I FARM FIFTY ONE ACRES OF LAND IN THE LAYOU VALLEY 
I EMPLOY SEVEN WORKERS AND THIS IS MY MAIN CITRUS PLOT 
DOMINICA'S LUSH CLIMATE HIGH LEVELS OF RAINFALL 
AND VOLCANIC EARTH RICH IN MINERALS HELP TO MAKE OUR SOIL FERTILE 
WE GROW TWO TYPES OF GRAPEFRUITS 
THE RUBY WHICH IS RED LIKE A RUBY 
AND A MARSH WHICH IS WHITE 
I COME HERE DURING SCHOOL HOLIDAYS AND SOMETIMES AT WEEKENDS 
WE PACK THE CITRUS INTO CRATES 
THEN ON SATURDAYS IT'S TAKEN TO THE MAIN PACKING PLANT IN ROSEAU 
THE CITRUS ARRIVES AT THE PACKING PLANT IN CRATES 
WE PUT THE GRAPEFRUITS ONTO A CONVEYOR BELT 
EACH FRUIT IS SIZED UP BIG MEDIUM SMALL 
AND CHANNELLED INTO A LANE 
THE BOXES ARE MARKED WITH THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN DOMINICA 
THIS IS MY MUM 
SHE'S A TEACHER DURING THE WEEK BUT AT WEEKENDS THIS IS FAMILY BUSINESS 
ALL THE BOXES ARE LOADED ONTO THE LORRY 
WE THEN TRAVEL TO THE PORT FIVE MINUTES' DRIVE AWAY 
AT THE PORT THE BOXES ARE LOADED ONTO THE BOATS 
WE'RE DROPPING IN TO ROSEAU PORT 
THE BOATS SUPPLY MANY EASTERN CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES 
SOME CITRUS PRODUCE ENDS UP IN BRITAIN 
SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE MONEY BROUGHT INTO DOMINICA'S ECONOMY IS FROM EXPORTS 
BANANAS AND CITRUS LEAD THE WAY

MY NAME IS CURT BOSTIC I WORK ON A GAS PLATFORM MY LEAVE IS OVER 
GAS AND OIL ARE TWO OF TRINIDAD'S MOST IMPORTANT NATURAL RESOURCES 
SOME GAS IS PROCESSED AND PUT INTO CYLINDERS AND USED FOR COOKING 
IT IS COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS OR C. N. G. 
YOU MADE TEA ARE YOU LEAVING ALREADY YES I'VE GOT TO GO 
BYE 
COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS HAS OTHER USES 
IT CAN BE USED TO FUEL CARS IT'S AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY FUEL 
THE FUEL IS PUMPED INTO THIS VALVE 
IT IS STORED IN THE BACK OF THE CAR IN THIS CYLINDER 
IT'S DRIVE TIME 
FROM THE NORTH OF THE ISLAND WHERE CURT LIVES 
TO THE SOUTH EAST WHERE THE OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE IS A THREE HOUR JOURNEY 
THE RESERVES ARE OFFSHORE 
TO GET TO THEM YOU HAVE TO TAKE A HELICOPTER OR A BOAT 
THE PLATFORM CURT IS HEADING FOR IS FIFTY SIX K. M. OFFSHORE 
I AM TRAVELLING TO CASSIA GAS PLATFORM WHERE I'LL WORK FOR A WEEK

THERE ARE MANY FACILITIES TO ENJOY WHEN YOU ARE OFF DUTY 
WELL THIS IS HOME FOR THE NEXT WEEK CASSIA PLATFORM 
BENEATH IT EIGHTY SEVEN M. OF WATER 
SO HERE WE ARE ONLY FIVE M. AWAY FROM THE OCEAN 
THAT'S WHY I HAVE MY LIFE JACKET ON 
THOSE LARGE PIPES THERE CONTAIN SMALLER PIPES 
THEY BRING GAS FROM THE RESERVE BENEATH THE SEA INTO THE PLATFORM 
THE GAS IN THESE PIPES HAS LIQUID WITHIN IT THIS HAS TO BE REMOVED 
THIS IS DONE BY THE SEPARATOR 
YOU CAN SEE THE LIQUID AT THIS POINT WHERE WE TAKE THE SAMPLE 
NOW THE GAS HAS NO LIQUID IN IT 
IT IS SENT THROUGH THIS PIPE TO THE MAINLAND 
THIS IS THE CONTROL ROOM THE HEART OF THE GAS OPERATION 
I WORK AS A PRODUCTION OPERATOR 
FROM HERE WE CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF GAS PRODUCED ON THE OTHER PLATFORMS 
WE FLOW FOURTEEN MILLION CUBIC METRES OF GAS 
TO HOMES AND BUSINESSES ON TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO 
SO AS TRINIDAD'S GAS GOES FROM THE PLATFORM INTO THE HOME 
WE BRING THE WORKING DAY TO A CLOSE 
SIT BACK AND RELAX WITH A CUP OF TEA 
HEATED UP BY TRINIDAD'S GAS OR OIL
