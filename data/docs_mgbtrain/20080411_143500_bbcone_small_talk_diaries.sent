FOR EVERY HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET WORK IT OUT 
THAT'S A LOT OF WORMS DECOMPOSING MORE LEAVES 
MORE POO MORE DEAD ANIMALS EVEN PIZZA 
THAN MOST OF THE OTHER CREATURES PUT TOGETHER

WE REALLY STICK OUR NECKS OUT FOR YOU LOT 
AND FOR ME THAT'S A BIG THING COS I'M PRETTY MUCH ALL NECK 
BURP PARDON ME BUT I'M NOT BRAGGING 
DECOMPOSITION ISN'T A COMPETITION WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER 
THE WOOD ANTS THE FLIES THE WOODLICE THE MAGGOTS EVERYONE 
WE CAN EAT MOST THINGS BUT NOT SWEET WRAPPERS AND TIN CANS 
AND NO ONE CAN GET THROUGH PLASTIC NOT EVEN US WORMS 
SO YOU HUMANS ARE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT STUFF YOURSELF 
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT 
THE DECOMPOSERS WHAT A TEAM 
BURP PARDON ME AGAIN 
THERE I WAS CHOMPIN' AWAY ON A WORM TURNS OUT HE WASN'T EVEN DEAD 
HOW EMBARRASSING IS THAT 
MISERABLE YEAH YOU'D BE MISERABLE IF YOU HAD TO WALK AROUND 
IN YOUR OWN SNOT ALL DAY 
IT'S NOT ONLY SQUARE POO I CAN DO 
I CAN ALSO DO OBLONG 
SHALL I HAVE A GO AT HEXAGON 
HNNNNNG 
ANYWAY I WOKE UP 
AND THERE'S THIS ANT 
TAKING A BITE OUT OF ME 
MAN IT FREAKED ME OUT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
OF DECOMPOSITION SO FAR
