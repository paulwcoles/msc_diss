THE NEAREST PART OF FRANCE CAP GRIS NEZ IS TWENTY ONE MILES AWAY 
AND EVERY YEAR FIFTEEN MILLION OF US 
MAKE THE CROSSING FOR A NATION OF ISLANDERS 
WE'RE VERY KEEN TO GET AWAY FROM THE PLACE 
WHILE SHIPS HAVE BEEN MAKING THAT ESCAPE POSSIBLE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THERE WAS ALREADY A TUNNEL UNDER THE CHANNEL 
BUT THAT AUDACIOUS PLAN TO CONNECT US TO FRANCE WAS NEVER FINISHED 
RICHARD STORER HAS OFFERED TO HELP ME UNCOVER THE HISTORY OF THE VICTORIAN CHANNEL TUNNEL 
GONNA DO SOME TUNNELLING THEN NICE TO SEE YOU YES WE ARE 
IT ALL STARTS WITH A FRENCH ENGINEER THOME DE GAMOND 
HE KNEW THAT CHALK WAS GOOD FOR TUNNELLING 
BUT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY NO ONE KNEW 
IF THERE WAS CHALK UNDER THE CHANNEL OR NOT 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOME DECIDED THAT HE HAD TO KNOW FOR SURE 
AND THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT WAS TO DIVE TO THE SEA BED 
AND COLLECT SAMPLES' 
I'VE GOT A SENSE OF TREPIDATION NOW YEAH 
WITH RICHARD'S HELP I WANT TO FIND OUT JUST HOW HARD THOME'S TASK MUST HAVE BEEN 
IN THE DAYS BEFORE ANY PROPER DIVING EQUIPMENT 
IT WAS A DIVE IN AND HOPE THAT HE COULD PICK SOMETHING UP 
WHAT PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES DID THOME DE GAMOND FACE 
HE PREPARED HIMSELF WITH LINT SOAKED IN LARD OR BUTTER 
FOR HIS EARS AND NOSTRILS 
WHY WELL THAT WAS TO KEEP OUT THE WATER 
BECAUSE AT LOWER DEPTHS THE PRESSURE OF THE WATER WOULD AFFECT 
HIS EARS AND NOSE JUST BEFORE HE JUMPED OVERBOARD HE TOOK A MOUTHFUL OF OLIVE OIL 
WHICH HE'D SEEN DONE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN BY PEARL DIVERS THAT SORT OF THING 
LIKE A PARTIAL SEAL THAT'S RIGHT YEAH WHAT DEPTHS DID HE GO TO 
WELL ABOUT THIRTY METRES ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FOOT 
THE DEEPEST PART OF THE CHANNEL JUST HOLDING HIS BREATH YEAH 
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING THAT DEEP 
BUT JUST AS GAMOND DID ON HIS SEARCH FOR THE SIGNS OF CHALK I'M GOING TO DIVE 
WITHOUT AN AIR SUPPLY DIVE MASTER RICHARD BULL AND HIS TEAM ARE HERE TO HELP 
THOME DE GAMOND NEEDED BANDAGES OLIVE OIL AND BUTTER BUT I DON'T 
ALL I'M TAKING IS MY GARDENING TROWEL AND MY BAG 
LIKE THOME DE GAMOND I'M HOLDING MY BREATH 
DIGGING FOR EVIDENCE OF THE CHALK BENEATH THE SEA BED 
GAMOND DIVED UP TO TEN TIMES DEEPER THAN I AM 
AND IT'S ALL THE MORE EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE LIKE ME 
THOME DE GAMOND WAS NOT A PROFESSIONAL DIVER 
AFTER ONLY THIRTY SECONDS MY LUNGS ARE BURNING 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A NIGHTMARE FOR GAMOND 
THAT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND ALL I'VE GOT 
IS A BEACH PEBBLE 
THANKFULLY GAMOND WAS A LOT MORE SUCCESSFUL 
HIS DIVES CONFIRMED THERE WAS A CONTINUOUS LAYER OF CHALK BETWEEN BRITAIN AND FRANCE 
BUT SADLY FOR HIM HE COULD NEVER RAISE THE MONEY TO START TUNNELLING 
BY THE LATE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTIES A BRITISH RAILWAY MAGNATE 
SIR EDWARD WATKIN HAD TAKEN UP THE CHALLENGE 
USING GAMOND'S DISCOVERY WATKINS' THEN REVOLUTIONARY PLAN 
WAS TO LINK LONDON TO PARIS DIRECT 
AND FOR THAT HE NEEDED A TUNNEL 
AT THE BASE OF THIS CLIFF IS THE FIRST EVER TRIAL TUNNEL FOR WATKINS' SCHEME 
RIGHT SO THIS IS IT OH LOOK AMAZING ISN'T IT UNBELIEVABLE 
CONSIDERING IT'S BEEN HERE FOR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS 
IT'S PERFECT IT LOOKS LIKE A MODERN JOB 
FOR SOME REASON I WAS EXPECTING IT TO LOOK HAND CUT 
OH NO NO IT WAS CUT WITH A MACHINE LIKE A BIG DRILL 
AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS IT'S UNLINED 
IT'S JUST THE BARE ROCK UH HUH THAT YOU CAN SEE 
THE NEWLY DEVELOPED DRILLING TECHNOLOGY WORKED BRILLIANTLY 
WHICH MADE IT ALL THE MORE FRUSTRATING FOR WATKIN 
THAT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO AFTER GETTING MORE THAN A MILE OUT TO SEA 
THE PROJECT WAS HALTED 
LOOKING AT THESE NEWSPAPER CUTTINGS FROM THE SAME YEAR 
IT TURNS OUT THAT NOT EVERYONE WAS HAPPY 
ABOUT THE IDEA OF JOINING OUR ISLAND 
TO THE REST OF EUROPE 
THIS LETTER TO THE TIMES IS A CLASSIC 
PROVIDENCE HAS GIVEN US THE SEA AS OUR SAFEGUARD IT SAYS 
WHY SHOULD WE FLY IN THE FACE OF PROVIDENCE AND THROW OUR SAFETY AWAY FOR WHAT AFTER ALL 
IS A MERCANTILE SPECULATION AND CERTAINLY CANNOT BE CALLED A NECESSITY 
ALL OF THE PUBLIC DISQUIET BECAME AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE 
THE PROJECT WAS PULLED AND WATKIN'S DREAM WAS OVER 
THE IDEA OF COURSE NEVER WENT AWAY 
THIS NINETY ACRE ADDITION TO THE COASTLINE 
SAMPHIRE HOE IS BUILT FROM THE CHALK 
REMOVED FROM THE SUCCESSFUL CHANNEL TUNNEL 
JUST BEYOND SAMPHIRE HOE THE CHALK CLIFFS GIVE WAY 
TO THE FLAT MARSHLAND AND SHINGLE BEACHES OF THE ROMNEY MARSHES 
NEARLY ONE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES OF RECLAIMED MARSHLAND 
NEATLY BISECTED BY THE ROMNEY HYTHE AND DYMCHURCH RAILWAY 
HOW MAD IS THAT 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S STILL OFF IN THE DISTANCE BUT NO IT'S RIGHT UP CLOSE 
AND JUST TITCHY TINY 
OPENED IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN AND EXTENDED TO DUNGENESS IN TWENTY EIGHT 
THE R. H. AND AMP DOCTOR IS A REAL RAILWAY JUST MUCH SMALLER 
IT'S ABOUT A THIRD OF THE STANDARD SIZE THE RAILS ARE ONLY FIFTEEN INCHES APART 
NEVERTHELESS IT RUNS A SCHEDULED SERVICE ALL YEAR ROUND 
AND AT THIRTEEN MILES LONG IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SEE THE ROMNEY MARSHES' 
MY DESTINATION IS THE END OF THE LINE 
DUNGENESS IS THE LARGEST SHINGLE BANK IN EUROPE 
MADE UP ENTIRELY OF FLINT ERODED FROM THE CHALK CLIFFS 
THAT'S ONE BIG PEBBLE BEACH 
NOW PART OF THE WIDER NATURE RESERVE 
IT'S HOME TO A THIRD OF ALL PLANT SPECIES IN BRITAIN 
COUNTLESS INSECT VARIETIES AND TWO NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS 
THE WARDEN OF THE NATURE RESERVE IS OWEN LEYSHON 
HOW YOU DOING GOOD TO SEE YOU 
HOW DID THIS LANDSCAPE HAPPEN 
DUNGENESS WAS FORMED OVER SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS 
AND ALL THESE PEBBLES ERODED OUT OF THE CHALK 
AROUND ABOUT THE END OF THE ICE AGE AND FROM THAT 
THEY WERE WASHED ALONG THE OLD SUSSEX SHORELINE TO DUNGENESS 
WHAT ATTRACTS YOU TO HIS PLACE IT LOOKS PRETTY BARREN AND BLEAK 
IT'S A VERY RICH LANDSCAPE 
WITH A LARGE VARIETY OF PLANTS 
AND INSECTS WHERE ARE THEY HIDING 
I CAN SEE NOTHING BUT PEBBLES THAT'S RIGHT 
YOU CAN SEE THE SEA KALE JUST POKING UP THROUGH THE SHINGLE NOW 
IF YOU CAME BACK IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS THERE'D BE 
ENORMOUS BIG WHITE POM POMS SCATTERED IN THOUSANDS 
ACROSS THE SHINGLE AS IF THE PLACE DIDN'T LOOK BIZARRE ENOUGH 
THE WHOLE PLACE IS SINGLE STOREY BUILDINGS AND YES 
OBVIOUSLY APART FROM THE POWER STATIONS ITSELF 
DO YOU SEE YOURSELF EVER LEAVING THIS AREA 
OR HAS IT GOT A HOLD ON YOU IT'S GOT A HOLD ON ME 
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR SOME TIME NOW 
IT'S A PLACE I REALLY DO ENJOY WORKING AND LIVING IN 
NOW COME ON LET'S DO IT 
THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS ARE OUT OF RETIREMENT 
YOU'RE MAURICE RILEY YOU'RE SYD WOOLSEY 
YOU'RE THE INVISIBLES 
ARGH 
THERE ISN'T A CAR I CAN'T DRIVE OR AN ALARM I CAN'T SILENCE 
OH OH 
THAT'S WHERE ALL THE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE COME FROM MAURICE 
YOU'VE GOT SKILLS THAT THE KIDS TODAY THEY JUST HAVEN'T GOT 
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A HITCH 
ALL RIGHT KEEP YOUR HAIR ON 
YOU TWO ARE MY GUIDING LIGHT 
DO THE CHECKS IN THIS JACKET MAKE ME LOOK CHUNKY 
HI HON NO IT'S FINE 
ME AND MAURICE ARE JUST HAVING A BIT OF A JOG 
CATCH THEM IF YOU CAN
