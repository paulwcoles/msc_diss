FROM ITS EARLIEST BEGINNINGS TELEVISION HAS BEEN THE TIME MACHINE 
THROUGH WHICH WE'VE VIEWED THE PAST 
AND THROUGHOUT THE AGES OF TELEVISION ONE SUBJECT 
HAS HAD AN ENDURING APPEAL AND SURPRISING FASCINATION 
ARCHAEOLOGY 
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT MADE ME FEEL REALLY ALIVE AND PART OF A CONTINUUM 
AND NOT NECESSARILY THIS THING CALLED HISTORY 
ARCHAEOLOGY HAS CREATED NATIONALLY SHARED MOMENTS 
AND GIVEN US MUCH LOVED FIGURES 
ACADEMICS HAVE BECOME CELEBRITIES AND CELEBRITIES HAVE TRIED TO BECOME ARCHAEOLOGISTS 
THE SECRETS OF LOST CIVILISATIONS BURIED TREASURE AND THE MYSTERIES 
OF THE PAST HAVE GRIPPED THE IMAGINATION OF GENERATIONS 
ARCHAEOLOGY'S UNIQUE OR RATHER THE ACT OF EXCAVATION IS UNIQUE 
NO ONE'S EVER DONE THAT BEFORE NO ONE CAN EVER DO IT AGAIN 
NOW NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE BRINGING US EVER CLOSER TO DECODING THE SECRETS OF OUR ANCESTORS 
THE PAST IS ABOUT PEOPLE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE OBJECT 
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONUMENTS IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT PEOPLE 
TO ALL THIS CINEMA HAS ADDED GLAMOUR AND EXCITEMENT 
THERE'S TREASURE TO BE FOUND EVIL TO BE FOUGHT 
AND CURSES TO BE CURSED 
BUT IN AN AGE OF CONSTANT CHANGE 
CAN THE LURE OF ARCHAEOLOGY CONTINUE TO CAPTIVATE NEW AUDIENCES 
IS THERE A FUTURE IN THE PAST 
WE DIG DIG DIG DIG DIG DIG DIG FROM EARLY MORN TILL NIGHT 
WE DIG DIG DIG DIG DIG DIG DIG UP EVERYTHING IN SIGHT 
AT THE DAWN OF TELEVISION HISTORY EVEN QUIZ PROGRAMMES CAME ARCHAEOLOGICALLY SHAPED 
IT'S OF THE ROMAN PERIOD 
FROM BOHEMIA OR THEREABOUTS 
DATE WHAT DATE 
ROMAN WELL GOOD HEAVENS 
THE EARLY CENTURIES AD YOU CAN'T DATE THAT POOR WRETCHED ANIMAL 
IT MIGHT BE SECOND THIRD OR FOURTH CENTURY 
AND OUR THREE EXPERTS ONLY ONE RIGHT ONE MARK 
OH DEAR THIS IS MY NEW SYSTEM 
ANIMAL VEGETABLE MINERAL ALSO GAVE ONE TALENTED YOUNG MAN HIS FIRST BREAK I JOINED IT 
AFTER THE FIRST EDITION 
AS A TRAINEE PRODUCER 
COMING FROM THE WORLD OF PUBLISHING I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TELEVISION WAS ABOUT 
BUT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR TO ME THAT IT WAS GREAT FUN 
IT'S A LADY POT 
GO ON IT'S A LADY POT 
A LADY POT UM IT'S A POT I THINK OF THE NEOLITHIC PERIOD WHY 
BECAUSE IT'S TOO BAD TO BE ANYTHING ELSE 
CHAIRED BY LEADING ARCHAEOLOGIST PROFESSOR GLYN DANIEL WITH GUESTS WHO WERE DISTINGUISHED ACADEMICS 
ANIMAL VEGETABLE MINERAL WAS A PANEL GAME WHERE CONTESTANTS HAD TO GUESS 
THE PROVENANCE OF ANCIENT ARTEFACTS A SORT OF VERY ANTIQUE ROADSHOW 
IT WASN'T A MATTER OF OBJECTS NECESSARILY IT WAS ABOUT CHARACTERS 
PEOPLE WHOSE ENTHUSIASMS CAME ACROSS ON THE SCREEN 
THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY THE LEADING SCHOLARS OF THEIR AGE AS WELL 
BUT THEY WERE WILDLY ENTHUSIASTIC 
ONE OF THE REGULAR GUESTS WAS THE MISCHIEVOUS AND RATHER RAFFISH SIR MORTIMER WHEELER 
ANIMAL VEGETABLE MINERAL MADE SIR MORTIMER INTO A NATIONAL INSTITUTION 
OF COURSE ALL THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MERIT 
THIS IS MERELY A QUESTION OF OLD AGE 
YOU CHOSE ME AS YOUR GUEST 
I'M PERFECTLY CERTAIN AS A SORT OF SYMBOL OF ANTIQUITY 
MORTIMER WHEELER WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN 
AND HE WAS A GIFT TO ARCHAEOLOGY AT A TIME 
WHEN ARCHAEOLOGY NEEDED CHARISMA 
HE ELEVATED THE ENTIRE PROFESSION 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE HIM THAT WAS TO DO WITH HIS STRENGTH OF PERSONALITY 
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE DID LIKE HIM HE DID SOME SPECTACULAR EXCAVATIONS THAT IMPRESSED COLLEAGUES 
BEHIND ME YOU SEE THE FLOOR OF ONE OF THE WEALTHIER HOUSES OF VERULAMIUM 
IT WAS PROBABLY LAID DOWN ORIGINALLY BY ROMAN OR ITALIAN CRAFTSMEN 
SIR MORTIMER WAS THE MOST FAMOUS ARCHAEOLOGIST OF HIS DAY 
AND ONE USED TO BEING IN THE MEDIA'S EYE 
HERE IS ANOTHER VESSEL WHICH HAS COME FROM THE WELL 
BEARING THE INSCRIPTION BIBE 
B. I B. E. WHICH MEANS DRINK 
WHAT THE DRINK WAS WE'RE NOT INFORMED 
HE ALSO SPECTACULARLY IMPRESSED THE BRITISH PUBLIC 
HE WAS A GREAT ENTERTAINER HE WAS A GREAT EDUCATOR HE ENJOYED IMMENSELY 
WHAT HE WAS DOING HE BELIEVED IN IT IT FIRED HIM WITH ENORMOUS PASSION AND HE SPREAD THAT 
HERE'S THE NEXT OBJECT WHICH IS OF STONE 
AND WHEN I SAW IT AGAIN TONIGHT 
I KNEW WHAT IT REMINDED ME OF BUT THERE WE ARE 
AS IT HAPPENS IN TEN DAYS' TIME I'M GOING TO SHOW A SLIDE 
OF THIS IN THE CITY OF CHELTENHAM AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF CELTIC ART 
CHELTENHAM HAS BEEN WARNED AND THE OTHER THING IS THIS 
THIS IS ONE OF THE TWO BEST EXAMPLES THAT I KNOW 
ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAY IN WHICH AN EMPHATIC MOUSTACHE 
CAN REDEEM A SOMEWHAT INTRACTABLE COUNTENANCE 
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY THING TO SAY IT 
BUT THE TELEVISION PERSONALITY OF THE YEAR ONE YEAR 
WAS GLYN DANIEL THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS QUIZ AN ARCHAEOLOGIST DON FROM CAMBRIDGE 
AND THEN MORTIMER WHEELER BECAME TELEVISION PERSONALITY OF THE YEAR 
IT'S UNTHINKABLE NOW 
WITH SUCH A HIT ON ITS HANDS THE B. B. C. GAVE GLYN DANIEL 
AND SIR MORTIMER A NEW MORE AMBITIOUS SERIES 
BURIED TREASURE 
THE PEAT BOG MURDER MYSTERY TOLD THE STORY OF A PUZZLING DEATH 
OF A DANISH PEASANT IN THE BRONZE AGE 
ONLY THE HEAD'S BEEN PRESERVED AT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM AT COPENHAGEN 
THE BODY HAS BEEN USED FOR EXAMINATION AND ANALYSIS 
THE WHOLE PRESERVATIVE PROCESS TOOK ABOUT FOURTEEN MONTHS 
BUT IT'S THE EXPRESSION WHICH IS PERHAPS THE MOST REMARKABLE THING 
ABOUT TOLLUND MAN THE HUMOUR AND THE WRINKLES AT THE CORNERS OF THE EYES 
AND THE SERENITY GIVE A QUITE EXTRAORDINARY IMPRESSION OF THESE EARLY PEOPLE 
HE LOOKS AS IF HE'S SEPARATED FROM US BY SLEEP RATHER THAN BY TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
WELL WE'VE GOT HERE IN THE STUDIO TONIGHT SIR MORTIMER WHEELER 
AND I WANT TO ASK HIM WHAT HE THINKS WHAT HIS FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE ON SEEING TOLLUND MAN 
WELL I SHOULD SAY THAT THIS IS THE MOST HAUNTING RELIC OF ANTIQUITY I'VE EVER SEEN 
AND EVEN IN THOSE DARK AGES OF BROADCASTING 
PROGRAMME MAKERS WERE FINDING CLEVER WAYS TO BRING ARCHAEOLOGY TO LIFE 
THE CONTENTS OF TOLLUND MAN'S STOMACH WERE SO WELL PRESERVED 
THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO RECONSTRUCT HIS LAST MEAL 
BUT DANIEL AND SIR MORTIMER CLEARLY NEEDED FEMALE HELP 
WHEN IT CAME TO THE COOKING 
WE KNOW ROUGHLY WHAT HIS LAST MEAL CONSISTED OF 
INCIDENTALLY IT WAS EATEN ABOUT TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE HE DIED 
WE KNOW ROUGHLY WHAT THE PROPORTIONS ARE AND WE ONLY KNOW VERY ROUGHLY HOW IT WAS COOKED 
WE'VE ONLY CERTAIN CLUES AS TO HOW IT WAS COOKED 
THE FIRST AND FOREMOST THING ABOUT IT IS THAT THERE'S NO TRACE OF MEAT WHATSOEVER IN WHAT WAS FOUND 
WITH THE RECONSTRUCTION OF TOLLUND MAN'S LAST MEAL 
IT WAS REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO PUT FLESH ON THE BONES OF ARCHAEOLOGY 
IT'S ABOUT MAKING WHAT SEEMED TO BE QUITE A STRANGE AT THAT TIME SUBJECT VERY FAMILIAR 
WE ALL UNDERSTAND COOKING AND EATING 
AND I THINK EXPERIMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT MAKING STRANGE THINGS FAMILIAR TO AUDIENCES 
THAT PROGRAMME IN ITSELF WAS VERY HUMOROUS 
VERY NICELY DRESSED NINETEEN SIXTIES WOMAN KNEELING DOWN BY THE NEOLITHIC HEARTH 
TO PREPARE THIS MEAL THAT THEN EVERYBODY HATED 
THE ONLY THING WE LEFT OUT OF THIS 
IS A SPOONFUL OF FINE SAND WHICH TOLLUND MAN HAD IN HIS 
WE DIDN'T PUT THAT IN OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR GLYN AND SIR MORTIMER 
NO GO AHEAD GLYN GO AHEAD 
IS IT DELICIOUS NO 
GLYN IS ANYONE LOOKING 
DO YOU KNOW I'VE SOLVED THIS PROBLEM HAVE YOU 
IF ONE COULD BE FRIVOLOUS IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE 
SOLEMN RELICS 
I WOULD SAY THAT THE POOR CHAP OF TOLLUND COMMITTED SUICIDE 
BECAUSE HE COULD STAND HIS WIFE'S COOKING NO LONGER 
VERY GOOD WHAT I SAY IS A LITTLE MORE ANIMAL 
A LITTLE LESS VEGETABLE THERE'S TOO MUCH VEGETABLE THERE'S TOO MUCH VEGETABLE 
AND NO MINERAL SALT OR SAND 
OH WELL 
ANYHOW WE'LL DRINK TO TOLLUND MAN IF NOT TO THIS DIET 
BLESS HIM SKOL SKOL 
GOOD STUFF YES IT IS 
GLYN DANIEL AND MORTIMER WHEELER LAUNCHED ARCHAEOLOGY ONTO BRITISH TELEVISION 
BUT IT TOOK A NEW CHANNEL AND ITS YOUNG NEW CONTROLLER 
TO SECURE IT A PERMANENT PLACE IN THE SCHEDULES 
BURIED TREASURE WHICH WAS THE B. B. C. ONE SERIES HAD COME TO AN END FOR SOME REASON 
B. B. C. TWO THEN TOOK UP THAT TORCH AND ELABORATED IT AND TURNED IT INTO CHRONICLE 
THE NEXT STEP WAS TO DO YOUR OWN EXCAVATION 
AND WHAT EXCAVATION COULD WE SUPPORT WHERE WE COULD HAVE CAMERAS THERE OVER A LONG PERIOD 
SO THAT YOU DIDN'T DO THIS BUSINESS OF FINDING SOMETHING AN ARCHAEOLOGIST FINDING SOMETHING 
RINGING UP THE B. B. C. AND THEN BURYING IT AGAIN SO YOU COULD SAY OH WHAT'S THIS 
WE WANTED THE REAL THING AND THE OBVIOUS THING WAS SILBURY HILL 
THE BIGGEST MAN MADE MONUMENT IN WESTERN EUROPE 
ENORMOUS VERY FAMOUS ON THE MAIN ROAD TO GO FROM LONDON TO BRISTOL 
AND I THOUGHT THAT'S MARVELLOUS WE COULD PUT A B. B. C. TWO O. B. UNIT ALONGSIDE 
SO EVERYBODY PASSING ALONG THIS MAIN ROAD WOULD SEE B. B. C. TWO BECAUSE WE WERE IN NEED OF PUBLICITY 
SOME THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE GREAT GREEN MOUND OF SILBURY HILL 
IN WILTSHIRE WAS DAZZLING WHITE A HUGE PILE OF GLEAMING CHALK 
STANDING OUT LIKE A BEACON 
THE LARGEST MAN MADE PREHISTORIC MOUND IN ALL EUROPE LABORIOUSLY PILED UP OVER 
WELL OVER WHAT ONE OF MY FIRST ENGAGEMENTS WITH ARCHAEOLOGY 
AS A KID WAS WATCHING THE EXCAVATION THAT WENT INTO THIS MOUND HERE SILBURY HILL 
AND IT WAS BROADCAST LIVE ON MY FUZZY LITTLE BLACK AND WHITE SCREEN AT HOME 
AND IT WAS AN EXCITING EVENT IT GALVANISED 
I THINK IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THE ENTIRE NATION IN A WAY THAT TELEVISION DOESN'T ANY MORE 
THE SILBURY DIG WAS NATIONAL NEWS AND IT PUT CHRONICLE AND REGULAR PRESENTER MAGNUS MAGNUSSON 
IN THE SPOTLIGHT ESPECIALLY WITH THE WHIFF OF BURIED TREASURE IN THE AIR 
LOCAL LEGEND HAS IT THAT IT WAS BUILT OVER THE GRAVE OF A CERTAIN 
OR RATHER OF A HIGHLY UNCERTAIN KING ZEL 
AND THAT AT THE HEART OF THE MOUND THERE LIES A LIFE SIZE STATUE OF KING ZEL ON HORSEBACK IN SOLID GOLD 
AS LEGENDS GO THAT'S AS GOOD AN EXPLANATION AS ANY 
THE FACT IS THAT WE SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW YET 
WHY THIS MOUND WAS BUILT AT SUCH PRODIGIOUS COST IN TIME AND ENERGY 
THERE WERE PROMISES OF TREASURE IT WAS DARK AND MYSTERIOUS 
WE HAD FUZZY SHAKY CAMERA WORK WE HAD A SPECTACULAR PRESENTER WHO WAS VERY SERIOUS 
WE HAD A POSH ARCHAEOLOGIST WHO SEEMED TO KNOW EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO KNOW ABOUT ARCHAEOLOGY 
I'M GOING TO CUT THE FIRST TURF AND THEN WE'LL BE READY TO DECLARE THE THING OPEN UP TO A POINT 
PROFESSOR RICHARD ATKINSON A MAN OF FORMIDABLE REPUTATION TOOK CHARGE OF THE DIG 
WHILE THE CONTROLLER OF B. B. C. TWO DAVID ATTENBOROUGH HANDLED THE PRESS IN LONDON 
MR. MARTIN GANZER THINKS THAT WE MIGHT FIND NOTHING AT ALL WHAT THEN 
WE CAN QUITE CERTAINLY SAY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIND NOTHING AT ALL BECAUSE THE MAIN OBJECT 
OF THIS OPERATION LIKE ANY OTHER ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION IS TO GET INFORMATION 
IT ISN'T A TREASURE HUNT AND IF WE FIND 
AS IT'S POSSIBLE WE MAY A VERY RICH BURIAL CENTRE THAT'S SIMPLY A BONUS 
HE MAY HAVE COME OVER AS A BIT OF A EAGLE FACED SHARP SHOOTER 
BUT IN FACT HE HAD A MISCHIEVOUS TWINKLE IN HIS EYE 
HE WENT ALONG WITH THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO HAVE TO MENTION 
KING ZEL ALL IN GOLD ON HIS GOLDEN HORSE COS THAT WAS THE LOCAL LEGEND 
THE FACT IS THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THERE IS IN THE CENTRE 
SOME PEOPLE MYSELF INCLUDED DON'T VERY MUCH CARE 
BUT FOR THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS THE REAL TREASURE WAS A HANDFUL OF DEAD SNAILS 
THIS BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE HELPED TO ESTABLISH THE MOUND 
AS OVER FOUR THOUSAND YEARS OLD BEFORE THE AGE OF METALS 
SO NO CHANCE OF A GOLDEN STATUE THEN 
OF COURSE IF WE HAD FOUND A GREAT SACK OF GOLD OR IF WE'D FOUND 
A MASS BURIAL OR SOMETHING IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE EXCITING 
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE WHOLE THING IS ABOUT 
THE WHOLE THING IS ABOUT ARCHAEOLOGY AND HOW WE DISCOVER ABOUT OUR PAST 
THE PRESS HAD GOT THE BIT BETWEEN THEIR TEETH 
THEY WERE DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REALLY GOING TO BE ABOUT TREASURE 
AND THAT WE WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED IF WE DIDN'T FIND IT 
IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT I SAID AND I GAVE LOTS OF PRESS CONFERENCES 
IT DIDN'T MATTER AT ALL EVERYBODY SAID 
WHEN IN THE END THE THING FINISHED AND WE HADN'T FOUND A GOLDEN HORSEMAN 
THEY SAID AH WELL THAT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT 
NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH 
DURING THE DIGGING SEASON THE PUBLIC FLOCKED TO THE SITE 
THE LIVE BROADCASTS HAD PUT SILBURY AND B. B. C. TWO ON THE MAP 
VIEWERS MAY NOT HAVE FOUND OUT WHY THE MOUND WAS CONSTRUCTED 
BUT AT LEAST NOW THEY KNEW THE WHEN AND THE HOW 
AND FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS CHRONICLE WOULD SET THE STANDARD 
FOR OTHERS TO FOLLOW DOCUMENTARIES THAT TRAVELLED THE GLOBE 
TO TELL THE GREATEST STORIES FROM THE PAST 
WHAT I WAS KEEN SHOULD HAPPEN IS THAT CHRONICLE SHOULD ESTABLISH A NETWORK AROUND THE WORLD 
SO THAT THE CHRONICLE UNIT WOULD KNOW WHAT DISCOVERIES WERE BEING MADE WHERE 
SO THAT THE FIRST THING THAT SOMEONE EXCAVATING IN AUSTRALIA OR IN SOUTH AMERICA WOULD SAY 
RIGHT WE'D BETTER GET ON TO THE CHRONICLE TEAM BECAUSE THEY WILL SEND OUT A UNIT WITH CAMERAS 
AND THEY CAN FILM THIS VERY IMPORTANT THING THAT'S HAPPENING 
AND THEREFORE CHRONICLE WOULD BE THE TOUCHSTONE AT THE CENTRE OF THIS NETWORK 
VERY OVERGROWN I'M AFRAID 
FIGHT MY WAY THROUGH 
WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO THE INCA RUINS OF CHOQUEQUIRAO WHICH ARE PERCHED 
ON A RIDGE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE APURIMAC CANYON BEHIND ME 
REMOTE AND STILL EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET TO THEY WERE DISCOVERED AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
THE FIRST LARGE GROUP OF INCA RUINS TO BE FOUND IN THE AREA 
THE B. B. C. FEATURES GROUP HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH TIMELIFE 
SO THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO GO FOR FIVE WEEKS TO GUATEMALA 
TO DO A FILM ABOUT THE RISE AND FALL OF THE MAYA CIVILISATION WITH SIR ERIC THOMPSON AND MAGNUS 
CONSIDERING HOW LITTLE THEY WERE THEY WENT IN FOR STEEP STEPS 
THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH ONE REASON THEY USED TO SEND SACRIFICIAL VICTIMS 
DOWN FROM THE TOP LET THEM GO DOWN AND THEY MUST HAVE GONE DOWN WITH ONE HECK OF A BUMP 
AND THE CONGREGATION WERE DOWN BELOW THERE 
AND WHEN THE BODY ARRIVED CERTAIN ONES HAD THE RIGHT TO CUT HIM UP AND TAKE PART 
KIND OF COMMUNION SERVICE 
I DON'T SUPPOSE THE VICTIM APPRECIATED IT BUT IT'S A MARVELLOUS VIEW 
OH BOY IT CERTAINLY IS HUH 
CHRONICLE WAS ALSO INSTRUMENTAL IN DEVELOPING A NEW IDEA 
IN ARCHAEOLOGY RECONSTRUCTING ITEMS FROM EARLY HISTORY 
THE TEAM BUILT A REPLICA OF A SKIN COVERED CURRAGH TO SEE 
HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE TO NAVIGATE THE IRISH SEA IN THE STONE AGE 
PAUL JOHNSTONE WHO HEADED UP CHRONICLE WAS INSPIRATIONAL 
IN LEADING OTHERS TO TAKE AN ADVENTURE IN THE PAST 
THEN AT LAST WE WERE READY OR MORE OR LESS ANYWAY 
AND AT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY IN THE AFTERNOON WE SET OFF 
THE GETAWAY WASN'T PERHAPS AS SMART AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT THEN 
I DON'T SUPPOSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH DIFFERENT IN THE STONE AGE 
THERE WAS POLITE APPLAUSE FROM THE CROWD A TOOT FROM THE TRAIN 
ON THE QUAY A FRIENDLY WHIFF FROM THE BACON FACTORY AND THE CROSSING HAD STARTED 
ONE OF THE THINGS HE DID FOR EXAMPLE 
WAS EVERYBODY KNEW THE STORY THAT SOME OF THE STONES IN STONEHENGE 
HAD BEEN BROUGHT FROM THE PRESELI MOUNTAINS IN WALES 
THE QUESTION WAS HOW AND ALL KINDS OF THEORIES WERE PROPOUNDED UNTIL PAUL SAID O. K. LET'S TRY IT 
SO HE CONSTRUCTED ONE OF THOSE STONES CORRECT IN WEIGHT AND SIZE AND SO ON 
AND THEN GOT TEAMS OF PUBLIC SCHOOL BOYS TO TRY AND WORK OUT 
HOW YOU COULD ACTUALLY OR COULD NOT DRAG IT 
HOW YOU COULD OR COULD NOT FLOAT IT ACROSS RIVERS AND SO ON 
WITH IT SITTING SECURELY ON THE PLATFORM WE SET OFF 
PUNTING UPRIVER WITH SOME BOYS OF BRYANSTON SCHOOL AS CREW 
EVEN THOUGH THEY WEREN'T PERHAPS THE MOST EXPERT PUNTERS IN THE COUNTRY WE HAD NO TROUBLE MOVING IT UPSTREAM 
NOW WITH TWENTY FOUR GALLANT VOLUNTEERS FROM CANFORD SCHOOL HAULING OFF WE GO 
BUT NO TWENTY FOUR CAN'T DO IT 
CAN TWENTY EIGHT 
NO IT'S STILL TOO MUCH FOR THEM CAN THIRTY TWO 
YES THEY CAN AND OFF THE SLEDGE GOES 
AND THAT KIND OF THING WHICH BECAME KNOWN AS EXPERIMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY 
WHERE THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS TOOK IT UP AT FIRST THEY SAID POOF 
THIS IS JUST POPULARISATION 
BUT BY THE SIXTIES AND THE LATE SIXTIES ARCHAEOLOGISTS WERE SAYING YES THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY 
EXPERIMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY WAS ONE THING THAT CHRONICLE STARTED OFF 
THINGS LIKE RECONSTRUCTING COSTUMES AND BOATS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
SO I SUPPOSE THERE WAS A LOGIC TO A LARGE SCALE EXPERIMENT LIKE LIVING IN THE PAST 
LIVING IN THE PAST WAS AN EXPERIMENT IN RECONSTRUCTING 
AN ANCIENT WAY OF LIFE FOR ONE ENTIRE YEAR A GROUP OF TWELVE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THREE SMALL CHILDREN 
FIRST BUILT THEN LIVED AND WORKED ON A REPLICA OF AN ANCIENT BRITISH FARM CUT OFF FROM THE MODERN WORLD 
THE DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO BECOME ANCIENT BRITONS THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE 
BUT THEY WORE OR DIDN'T WEAR THE SAME KIND OF CLOTHES LIVED IN THE SAME KIND OF BUILDINGS 
RAISED THE SAME CROPS AND LIVESTOCK AND USED THE SAME TOOLS WHICH ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND HISTORIANS 
TELL US WERE USED MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO IN THE IRON AGE 
WITH THOSE LIVING IN PROGRAMMES IT SET THE STAGE FOR PROGRAMMES LIKE BIG BROTHER 
IT SHOWED YOU THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL SCENARIO FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE IN 
YOU THROW THEM IN AND YOU SEE HOW THEY COPE OR HOW THEY DON'T COPE 
AND THAT MAKES GREAT TELEVISION 
I SAID IF SHE WANTS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE BLOODY PLOUGH SHE CAN SAY IT TO ME 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S FAIR THAT'S HAPPENED WITH BACON 
WELL WHY SHOULDN'T SHE HAVE MORE 
BUT YOU CAN'T THEN TURN ROUND AND SAY YOU'RE EATING IT THROUGH SUFFERANCE 
I'M NOT I SAID TO YOU THIS MORNING I SAID I DIDN'T LIKE MEAT 
I GAVE UP MEAT FOR MORAL AND RELIGIOUS REASONS THE SAME REASONS PRACTICALLY AS YOU GAVE IT UP FOR 
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO EAT IT AT FIRST 
I'VE SPENT SUCH A LONG TIME TELLING MYSELF THIS IS FLESH I DON'T WANT TO EAT IT 
SO I CAME HERE AND HAD TO SAY THIS ISN'T FLESH I HAVE TO START EATING IT THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO EAT 
THE PUBLIC MAY HAVE BEEN TUNING IN TO CATCH THE SOAP OPERA OF IRON AGE LIFE BUT THE PROGRAMMES 
WERE A VIVID LIVING EXPERIMENT FOR ARCHAEOLOGISTS LIKE BARRY CUNLIFFE 
RIGHT FINE 
IT'S GOT THE BIG ADVANTAGE THAT WE STICK THE WHEAT 
IN A BUNDLE OF CLOTH AND YOU JUST LEAVE IT 
THERE'S NO WORRY OF IT OVER PARCHING YOU CAN'T OVER PARCH IT THERE'S NO WORRY OF IT BURNING 
IT'S JUST UP THERE WHEN YOU WANT IT 
I WAS INVITED ON RIGHT AT THE END JUST TO SEE HOW I RESPONDED TO GOING INTO THIS ALIEN WORLD 
WHICH IN THEORY I KNEW ALL ABOUT BECAUSE I'D BEEN DIGGING IT UP 
AND WRITING ABOUT IT AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT AT ALL 
THAT I CAME AWAY WITH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT IMPRESSION THAN I COULD HAVE GOT FROM MY ARCHAEOLOGY 
I REMEMBER PARTICULARLY GOING INTO A HUT AND SITTING DOWN INSIDE A HUT AND HAVING STEW 
THAT WAS BEING MADE AND NOTICING A RATHER RAGGED HOLE 
JUST INSIDE THE THRESHOLD 
OF THE HUT IN THE FLOOR THE EARTH FLOOR A SORT OF GRITTY DUSTY HOLE 
AND LITERALLY JUST TWO OR THREE WEEKS BEFORE THAT 
I'D BEEN EXCAVATING AN IRON AGE HUT IN THE HILL FORT OF DANEBURY 
AND SEVERAL TIMES IN SEVERAL HUTS I'D FOUND HOLES RATHER LIKE THIS JUST INSIDE THE DOOR 
I SUDDENLY SAW THIS AND I SAID TO ONE OF THE GUYS HOW DID THAT FORM 
HE SAID OH IT'S THE CHICKEN THEY JUST COME IN 
AND THEY TAKE A DUST BATH THERE 
THEY LIKE IT THERE AS IT'S NOT RIGHT IN THE HOUSE BUT IT'S WARM 
THERE'S STILL SUNLIGHT AND SO ON 
SO SUDDENLY MY EYES WERE OPENED I WAS UNDERSTANDING MY ARCHAEOLOGY MORE 
AND ALSO GOING THERE 
AND SEEING SUDDENLY THE ABSENCE OF COLOUR 
IT WAS ALL DUN COLOURS IT WAS ALL GREYS AND BROWNS 
AND REALISING THE IRON AGE WORLD WAS A WORLD WITHOUT COLOUR 
THAT MADE ME APPRECIATE HOW IMPORTANT 
POLISHED BRONZE AND RED ENAMEL WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE IRON AGE 
THERE ARE LOTS OF ORNAMENTS OF BRONZE AND ENAMEL 
SO IT OPENED MY EYES ENORMOUSLY AND THAT WAS AN UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE TO ME 
AT TIMES THE VILLAGE SEEMED MORE SEVENTIES NEW AGE THAN LATE IRON AGE 
IN OCTOBER THE VILLAGERS ERECTED A GIANT WICKER MAN 
COMPLETE WITH PERIOD FLARES TO CELEBRATE THE CELTIC FESTIVAL 
OF SAMHAIN WHICH LATER BECAME HALLOWEEN AND IS NOW MIXED UP WITH BONFIRE NIGHT 
THEY WERE DETERMINED TO HAVE A PROPER PAGAN FESTIVAL 
BURN HIM BURN HIM 
OVER THE YEAR WE FELT THERE'S MORE AND MORE TO CELEBRATE REALLY 
WE'VE BEEN WANTING TO GET THE FESTIVALS ORGANISED 
ON A MORE ELABORATE FOOTING BECAUSE WE REALISED 
THAT THE MORE YOU PUT INTO THEM THE MORE YOU GET OUT 
BUT CHRONICLE WASN'T ABOVE THE ODD CROWD PULLER 
A SERIES OF PROGRAMMES EMBRACED PERHAPS THE MOST IMAGINATIVE TOSH 
OF THE AGE COURTESY OF FORMER DOCTOR WHO SCRIPTWRITER HENRY LINCOLN REAL NAME HENRY SOSKIN 
A STORY THAT WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE SOURCES 
OF A LATER PUBLISHING SENSATION 
MYSTERY AND DRAMA CAN SOMETIMES LIE HIDDEN IN THE MOST TRANQUIL OF SETTINGS 
AND THE MOST TANTALISING OF MYSTERIES ARE THOSE WHICH SPEAK OF HIDDEN TREASURE 
THIS REMOTE MOUNTAIN TOP VILLAGE IN SOUTHERN FRANCE MIGHT WELL CONCEAL THAT TANTALISING X. 
WHICH MARKS THE SPOT ON A TREASURE MAP 
OR PERHAPS IT CONCEALS SOMETHING MORE 
EVERYWHERE THE CHURCH IS COVERED WITH FLAMBOYANT DETAILED DECORATION 
SLIGHTLY DISTURBING SLIGHTLY UNCOMFORTABLE 
AND YET CURIOUSLY LACKING IN ATMOSPHERE 
THE CHURCH HAS BEEN SUCKED DRY 
HENRY WAS A FRIEND OF MINE I KNEW HIM VERY WELL 
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM FOR YEARS BUT HENRY WAS A GOOD PAL 
AND DURING THE MAKING OF THE PRIEST THE PAINTER AND THE DEVIL 
WHICH WAS THE CHRONICLE PROGRAMME 
I WOULD MEET HIM IN THE EVENINGS AND HE WAS TERRIBLY EXCITED 
WITH INFORMATION WHICH HAD COME INTO HIS POSSESSION 
I REMEMBER HIM SAYING OVER A PINT OF GUINNESS ONE EVENING HE SAID IT'S A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY 
IF ONLY I COULD TELL YOU WHAT IT IS THAT I KNOW 
IT WOULD MEAN THE END OF WESTERN CIVILISATION AS WE KNOW IT 
AND THE TREASURE OF THE TEMPLARS HAS NEVER COME TO LIGHT 
THE TREASURE OF THE TEMPLE OF JERUSALEM 
THE TREASURE OF THE VISIGOTHS 
THE TREASURE OF THE TEMPLARS OF BEZU 
THREE DIFFERENT TREASURES OR JUST ONE TREASURE BEING CONSTANTLY EXPLOITED 
BUT THE POSSIBILITIES ARE NOT EXHAUSTED YET 
NO ONE EVER DENIED THAT THE TEMPLARS FOUGHT AND DIED VALIANTLY FOR CHRIST 
AND YET ONE OF THE ACCUSATIONS MADE AGAINST THEM AT THEIR TRIAL 
WAS THAT THEY DENIED CHRIST AND TRAMPLED ON THE CROSS 
THE STORY OF THE SUPPOSED TREASURE OF RENNES LE CHATEAU GATHERED CHRONICLE ITS LARGEST EVER AUDIENCE 
IT WAS POPULAR THEN BUT MUCH MORE POPULAR SINCE 
IT WAS A WONDERFUL STORY 
AND IN FACT WE WENT INTO VERY CONSIDERABLE DETAIL 
ABOUT ALL KINDS OF RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN FRANCE AND ONE THING OR ANOTHER 
AND THAT I SUPPOSE I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHAT I SAY LEGALLY 
WHETHER IT'S THE BASIS OF THE D. A. VINCI CODE I CAN'T SAY 
BUT CERTAINLY IT'S VERY LIKE THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
AND HERE IS THE FIRST MESSAGE 
IN HENRY SOSKIN'S SORRY HENRY LINCOLN'S PROGRAMMES 
WE WERE INTRODUCED TO A WORLD OF SYMBOLS CODES FALSE TRAILS 
AND BURIED TREASURE ALL LEADING TO THE BLINDING REVELATION 
THAT CHRIST HAD NOT DIED ON THE CROSS 
ET A SION EST CE TRESOR ET IL EST 
AND HIS DESCENDANTS WERE THE MEROVINGIAN KINGS WHO RULED FRANCE IN THE DARK AGES 
DAGOBERT WAS ONE OF THE LAST KINGS OF THE MEROVINGIAN DYNASTY OF FRANCE 
HE WAS ASSASSINATED IN THE YEAR SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE AD 
IT IS PERHAPS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT A DARK AGES ROYAL TREASURY COULD BE HIDDEN AWAY HERE 
BUT ZION 
ZION IS JERUSALEM 
EVEN WE WHO WORKED ON THE SERIES SAID WE'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THAT 
BUT OF COURSE THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF TRUTH IN IT AND HENRY WAS A CONSUMMATE STORY TELLER 
AND IT BASED ITSELF AROUND THE ONE THING WHICH STILL SELLS ARCHAEOLOGY WHICH IS A MYSTERY 
A MYSTERY BASED ON A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FACT AND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MISINTERPRETATION OF SOME FACTS 
BUT WE THOUGHT WELL WE'LL NOT HEAR ANY MORE OF THAT 
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED 
FOR YEARS HENRY LINCOLN 
WE NOW KNOW THAT WESTERN CIVILISATION DIDN'T END IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
THOUGH AT THE TIME SOME PEOPLE TOOK HENRY'S WORD AS GOSPEL 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT GOSPEL I DON'T KNOW WHOSE GOSPEL 
BUT YES OF COURSE BUT IT WAS 
O. K. IT MADE YOU THINK ABOUT THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION ABOUT HISTORY 
WHERE DO YOU GO AND LOOK FOR INFORMATION HOW DO YOU CONFIRM THESE THINGS 
WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS NOT TRUE WHAT IS FANCY AND WHAT IS FABLE 
IT SERVED A VERY INTERESTING AND VALUABLE POINT ABOUT HOW YOU THINK ABOUT HISTORY 
HENRY LINCOLN ASIDE CHRONICLE CONTINUED TO LEAD THE FIELD THROUGHOUT THE NEXT TWO DECADES 
IT PIONEERED NEW BRANCHES OF ARCHAEOLOGY BY EMBRACING OUR RECENT INDUSTRIAL PAST 
ONE OF CHRONICLE'S NOTABLE SUCCESSES SPRANG OUT OF THE DECISION TO SEND 
A YOUNG PRODUCER RAY SUTCLIFFE DOWN TO THE FALKLANDS TO FILM THE S. S. GREAT BRITAIN 
ONE OF THE GREAT MONUMENTS OF THE AGE OF IRON AS IT LAY BATTERED BY THE SOUTH ATLANTIC GALES 
RAY CAME UP WITH THE PROPOSAL THAT THE VERY FIRST IRON SHIP 
POWERED STEAM SHIP WAS SITTING ROTTING IN THE FALKLAND ISLANDS 
AND WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT TO BRING IT BACK 
IN A RACE AGAINST THE COMING WINTER STORMS 
THE BOAT WAS HURRIEDLY PREPARED 
FOR ITS HOMEWARD VOYAGE ACROSS TWO OCEANS 
THEY HAD REFURBISHED THAT DECKHOUSE THEMSELVES AS SOMEWHERE COMFORTABLE TO EAT THEIR BREAKFAST 
THAT WAS ONLY THE SMALL MIZZENMAST AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE IF SOMEBODY HAD BEEN IN THE WAY 
IT WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WHICH STARTED FROM SMALL BEGINNINGS 
AND REALLY BECAME A PROGRAMME OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE 
AS ONE OF THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS THAT CHRONICLE MADE TO ARCHAEOLOGY I THINK 
THE GREATEST TRIUMPH OF BRUNEL'S MOST FAMOUS SHIP WAS ITS FINAL 
PROGRESS UP THE AVON GORGE UNDER BRUNEL'S OWN SUSPENSION BRIDGE 
TO ITS HOME PORT IN BRISTOL 
THE S. S. GREAT BRITAIN NOW HAS A PERMANENT RESTING PLACE 
IN THE VERY DOCK WHERE SHE WAS BUILT NEARLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO 
THE S. S. GREAT BRITAIN WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE HAPPIEST ACCIDENTS OF HISTORY 
NOT JUST FROM TELEVISION'S POINT OF VIEW BUT MARITIME HISTORY 
IF YOU CHOSE ANY SHIP OF ANY CENTURY THIS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE ONE AND IT WAS JUST ABOUT IN TIME 
TELEVISION WAS IN THE PROCESS OF INVENTING A NEW DISCIPLINE I. NDUSTRIAL ARCHAEOLOGY 
UP UNTIL THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
ARCHAEOLOGISTS DIDN'T REALLY THINK THAT THE POST MEDIEVAL PERIOD 
IN GENERAL THE PERIOD FROM THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY ONWARDS 
WAS REALLY THEIR DOMAIN AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUB DISCIPLINES 
LIKE INDUSTRIAL ARCHAEOLOGY IS REALLY VERY NEW INDEED 
INDUSTRIAL ARCHAEOLOGY CONNECTED WITH A GENERATION WHICH HAD BECOME ACUTELY CONSCIOUS 
OF THE WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION OF MUCH OF THE MANUFACTURING PAST 
INSIDE THIS BOTTLE SHAPED HOVEL WAS A HUGE OVEN STACKED FULL OF TILES 
YOU CAN SEE HOW BIG IT WAS FROM THIS RING OF FIRE PITS AND THE FIRES 
IN THESE WENT THROUGH THE OVEN FIRING THE TILES 
AND THE SMOKE WENT OUT OF THE TOP OF THE KILN 
WHAT IT HAD IN TELEVISUAL TERMS WAS MASS AND SCALE 
YOU COULD WALK INTO IT AND WALK OUT OF IT 
IT WASN'T A SERIES OF LOW WALLS OR HOLES IN THE GROUND LIKE OTHER KINDS OF ARCHAEOLOGY 
AND YOU COULD UNDERSTAND PROCESS YOU COULD GO AND SEE THE BITS OF MACHINERY THAT DID THINGS 
AND THAT INVOLVED PEOPLE STRAIGHT AWAY I THINK 
WITH BOTH THE RECENT PAST AND THE PAST OF THEIR PARENTS AND THEIR GRANDPARENTS 
OPEN IT 
SOMEBODY SAID TO US THEY SAID YOU'LL NEVER GET THAT BLOODY WHEEL GOING AGAIN 
I SAYS WE CAN 
IT'S THE HUMAN PAST THAT PEOPLE FIND FASCINATING 
IN THE INDUSTRIAL ARCHAEOLOGY THE WAY THAT PEOPLE HAD TO WORK 
IN THESE FACTORIES WHAT THEY'RE PRODUCING 
HOW THIS HAD A GREAT EFFECT ON THE GROWTH OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE 
THE HUMAN STORIES ARE THERE AND TELEVISION HELPED TO TEASE THOSE OUT 
AND THAT I THINK CAME OVER EXTREMELY WELL IN INDUSTRIAL ARCHAEOLOGY ON TELEVISION 
IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH INDUSTRIAL ARCHAEOLOGY WAS MADE FOR TELEVISION 
BUT TELEVISION WAS MADE FOR INDUSTRIAL ARCHAEOLOGY 
THROUGH TELEVISION ARCHAEOLOGY SPOKE DIRECTLY TO THE PUBLIC 
THE KENNET AND AVON CANAL THE M. FOUR OF ITS DAY 
HAD BEEN DERELICT SINCE NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN 
PROGRAMMES SUCH AS MANSCAPE HELPED TO PUT ITS RESTORATION BACK ON THE AGENDA 
NEIL COSSINS WAS AMONG THOSE LEADING THE CHARGE TO RECOGNISE AND PRESERVE THE BEST OF THE OLD 
BY FAR THE BIGGEST AND MOST SPECTACULAR ENGINEERING FEATURE 
ON THE WHOLE ROUTE OF THE KENNET AND AVON IS HERE AT DEVIZES 
WHERE THE CANAL HAD TO DROP DOWN SOME TWO FIFTY F. T. 
FROM THE VALE OF PEWSEY FROM THE WILTSHIRE DOWNS 
DOWN INTO THE VALLEY OF THE RIVER AVON 
THIS DROP WAS ACHIEVED IN THIS AMAZING FLIGHT OF TWENTY NINE LOCKS 
THE RESTORATION OF THIS SECTION WITH ITS MASSIVE SIDE PONDS 
POSES FORMIDABLE PROBLEMS PROBLEMS THAT MUST BE OVERCOME 
IF THIS IS TO BE A LIVING WATERWAY ONCE AGAIN 
ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY MEANT ARCHAEOLOGY COULD CONTINUE 
TO TAKE ON NEW AND EVEN MORE DAUNTING PROJECTS 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO CHRONICLE WAS CONTACTED BY A TEAM OF DIVERS 
THEY'D SET OUT TO FIND THE FLAGSHIP OF HENRY THE EIGHTH'S FLEET THE MARY ROSE 
THEY SAID WE'LL FIND THIS TUDOR BATTLESHIP BECAUSE LIKE THE GREAT BRITAIN IT'S SEMINALLY IMPORTANT 
SO WE SAID RIGHT WE'LL SIGN A CONTRACT 
AND BECAUSE WE WERE CONTINUALLY THERE WE COULD FOLLOW IT 
AND WE DID AND THE VERY FIRST ONE WAS SIMPLY WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A MAGAZINE ITEM 
THE FIRST THINGS THAT CAME UP WERE SEVERAL TEACUPS FROM THE ISLE OF WIGHT FERRY 
A COUPLE OF DINKY TOYS AND ONE RATHER BATTERED LOOKING PIECE OF WOOD 
AND EVERYONE SAID SO YOU'RE GOING TO BRING UP A TUDOR BATTLESHIP 
THE ANSWER WAS YES PROVIDED YOU CAN HANG ON FOR TEN YEARS 
BUT LIVE ON T. V. THE RAISING OF THE SKELETAL REMAINS 
OF THE SHIP TURNED OUT TO BE EVEN MORE DRAMATIC THAN PLANNED 
GOING VERY WELL WE'RE LIFTING OFF THE SEA BED THE UNDERWATER LIFTING FRAME 
IS JUST ABOUT TWO METRES DOWN BENEATH THE WATER 
AND NOW THE PUMPS WHICH WILL PUMP OUT THE WATER FROM INSIDE THE HULL ARE BEING PLACED IN POSITION 
THESE ARE ESSENTIAL BECAUSE ONE MUST REDUCE THE LEVEL OF THE WATER 
INSIDE THE HULL TO EQUALISE WITH THE LEVEL OUTSIDE 
AND SO THIS IS THE LAST PHASE BEFORE SHE BEGINS TO BREAK THE WATER'S SURFACE 
WHEN YOU BRING AN OBJECT UP OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN 
AND IT SUDDENLY COMES OUT INTO THE AIR THAT'S A MOMENT OF REVELATION 
WHICH OF COURSE IS HUGELY EXCITING AND DRAMATIC 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF COURSE IS THAT IT IS ALSO THE MOMENT WHEN IT DOUBLES ITS WEIGHT 
OR WHATEVER THE FIGURE IS BECAUSE INSTEAD OF BEING SUPPORTED BY WATER SUDDENLY 
IT'S OUT IN THE AIR AND THE WEIGHT IS HUGE AND HUGE STRAIN IS PUT ON THE LIFTING APPARATUS 
WELL I CAN SEE THROUGH THE WINDOW OF DIVE CONTROL 
THAT THE VESSEL IS NOW RISING IN THE WATER 
AND THAT THE MASSIVE CRANE OF TOG MOR 
IS LIFTING THE VESSEL FURTHER 
COLONEL WHAT'S HAPPENED THERE 
IT WOULD LOOK AS THOUGH THE LEG ON THE RIGHT SOMETHING HAS GIVEN THERE 
ER AND THE SUPERSTRUCTURE HAS COME DOWN ON 
DROPPED DOWN A CERTAIN DISTANCE 
AND THANK GOODNESS IT WAS NOT A DISASTER BECAUSE IN THE END IT WAS REPAIRED AND CAME OUT 
AND THE BUT THE SIZE OF THE THING 
AND THE DETAIL IN WHICH IT WAS PRESERVED 
HAVE MADE IT AN ENORMOUS SPECTACLE A WONDERFUL THING TO SEE 
T. V. ARCHAEOLOGY THRIVED NOT JUST ON SPECTACLE BUT GREAT COMMUNICATORS 
AND IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IT FOUND A NEW ONE MICHAEL WOOD 
THE IDEAL BLEND OF AN ACADEMIC AND AN ADVENTURER WITH FLOWING HAIR 
AND A TIGHTLY PACKED ARGUMENT A MAN BORN WITH CHARISMA IN HIS GENES 
WELL MICHAEL WOOD WAS A REAL RADICAL DEPARTURE 
FOR ARCHAEOLOGY ON TELEVISION 
ALTHOUGH WE'D HAD PERSONALITIES LIKE MAGNUS MAGNUSSON AND SIR MORTIMER WHEELER 
MICHAEL WOOD DIDN'T HAVE THE KIND OF ECCENTRICITY ASPECT 
HE WAS JUST VERY FILM STAR HANDSOME AND I THINK THAT WAS ABLE TO ATTRACT A WHOLE NEW AUDIENCE TO ARCHAEOLOGY 
ARCHAEOLOGY WASN'T NECESSARILY CRANKY IT WAS SERIOUS IT WAS EXCITING IT WAS QUITE GLAMOROUS 
AND MICHAEL WOOD'S PARTICULAR APPEARANCE AND HOW THAT FIT WITH THE PARTICULAR PLACES 
THAT HE WENT TO FOR HIS VARIOUS SERIES BREATHED A NEW LIFE INTO ARCHAEOLOGY ON TELEVISION 
HE CAME AT THE SUBJECT MATTER ERM AS AN ACADEMIC 
HE WAS CONFIDENT WITH HIS MATERIAL 
AND I THINK THAT CONFIDENCE SHOWED IN THE WAY THAT THE PROGRAMMES WERE MADE 
I REMEMBER PARTICULARLY THE ONE ABOUT THE TROJAN WARS 
AND THE MYCENAEANS WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A VERY VERY GOOD SERIES 
AT TROY MICHAEL WOOD RETRACED THE STEPS 
OF THE FIRST GREAT ARCHAEOLOGIST OF THEM ALL HEINRICH SCHLIEMANN 
CONVINCED THAT HOMER'S TROY MUST LIE DEEP INSIDE THE HILL 
SCHLIEMANN ATTACKED IT WITH SOMETIMES OVER ONE HUNDRED WORKMEN 
ARMED WITH THE BEST ENGLISH PICKAXES WHEELBARROWS WINDLASSES 
CHAINS AND BATTERING RAMS TO DRIVE AND A TERRIFIC HOLE INTO HISSARLIK 
AND THIS IS SCHLIEMANN'S GREAT TRENCH TODAY LIKE A BOMB SITE 
YOU CAN STILL WALK UP IT RIGHT INTO THE HEART OF THE MOUND 
WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING ANY ARCHITECTURAL DETAIL AT ALL 
ARCHITECTURAL DETAIL THERE WAS THOUGH 
HE DESCRIBES A PREHISTORIC BUILDING THAT HE FOUND TWENTY F. T. DEEP 
WITH TEN F. T. HIGH WALLS MADE OF SQUARED BLOCKS OF LIMESTONE 
BEAUTIFULLY SMOOTHED 
ALL OF WHICH HE DESTROYED 
BUT SEARCHING FOR A TROY THAT LOOKED LIKE HOMER'S TROY 
SCHLIEMANN PRESSED ON DEEPER INTO HISSARLIK 
WHAT MICHAEL HAS TO DEAL ERM IS MUCH BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN A NATURAL HISTORY PRESENTER HAS TO DEAL WITH 
NATURAL HISTORY IS GOING ON BEHIND HIM THERE'S THIS BIRD OF PARADISE WAGGLING ITS WINGS ABOUT 
ERM THERE ISN'T A QUEEN FROM ANCIENT ROME 
SITTING BEHIND MICHAEL WOOD 
MICHAEL WOOD HAS TO CREATE ALL THESE PEOPLES 
AND CREATE ALL THESE SITUATIONS IN WORDS 
AND HE DOES IT EXTRAORDINARILY SKILFULLY WALKING OVER THE SITES 
WHERE THERE IS NOTHING BUT RUMPLED LAWN AND GRASS AND A FEW OLIVE TREES 
AND MICHAEL BRINGS TO LIFE THE COLUMNS THAT ONCE STOOD THERE 
AND THE PEOPLE OF ANCIENT GREECE WHO ONCE ROAMED THERE AND HE DOES IT WITH GREAT SKILL 
ON THE NIGHT BEFORE HE FIRST SET EYES ON IT HE SLEPT ON A WOODEN BENCH IN A WRETCHED INN 
PESTERED BY MOSQUITOES BUT OBLIVIOUS TO THE DISCOMFORT 
AS HE CONTEMPLATED THE GIGANTIC FIGURES OF THE GREEK HEROES 
IN THIS MEMORABLE PLACE 
HEROES WHO MURDERING AND MURDERED 
WERE SACRIFICED TO THEIR INEXORABLE FATE 
I REMEMBER HIM SORT OF SITTING 
SWEATING OVER HIS TEXTS IN HIS TENT AT NIGHT AND PUTTING ON THIS 
BUT HE WAS VERY ACCEPTABLE ACADEMICALLY VERY ACCEPTABLE 
BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING 
AND HE KNEW HOW TO BE EXCITING WITH IT 
SO HE WAS BOTH AN ARCHAEOLOGIST HISTORIAN AND A PROGRAMME MAKER 
AND THAT IS A VERY VERY RARE COMBINATION 
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER PERSON WHO ACTUALLY STRADDLES THAT DIVIDE 
BY A STRANGE COINCIDENCE IN A GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY 
HOLLYWOOD WAS CREATING A NEW ARCHETYPE OF THE ARCHAEOLOGIST ADVENTURER 
TRUST ME 
RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK HAD A HUGE IMPACT 
I KNOW MYSELF I SAW THE FILM ABOUT THIRTEEN TIMES 
AND IT WAS VERY MUCH RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK AND WATCHING MICHAEL WOOD 
THAT MADE ME VERY INTERESTED IN ARCHAEOLOGY CLEARLY FOR AN ADOLESCENT GIRL 
THERE WAS AN ASPECT OF ATTRACTIVE MEN DOING EXCITING THINGS AND I WANTED TO BE A PART OF THAT 
BUT I THINK MUCH MORE GENERALLY CULTURALLY IT GAVE A SENSE THAT ARCHAEOLOGY 
WAS AN EXCITING ACTIVITY TO DO AND REALLY DROVE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
TO BE QUITE INTERESTED TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT TO SEE IF THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THEY'D WANT TO DO 
JUST AS THE WORLD WAS GETTING TURNED ON TO ARCHAEOLOGY 
CHRONICLE RETURNED TO THE DUST FROM WHENCE IT CAME 
BUT IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE A DYNAMIC UPSTART CAME TO REPLACE IT 
IT WAS QUITE A BOMBSHELL REALLY 
THAT SOMETHING LIKE ARCHAEOLOGY COULD HAVE BEEN PACKAGED IN SUCH AN IMAGINATIVE WAY 
AND PRESENTED AS ENTERTAINMENT 
AND THAT IT WAS VERY POPULAR AND IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL 
IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD IDEA AND THE FACT THAT IT'S LASTED FOR FIFTEEN SERIES NOW 
OBVIOUSLY IS TESTAMENT TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA 
IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER THAT TIME TEAM'S FORMAT OF ONLY THREE DAYS 
TO REVEAL THE PAST OPENED IT UP TO A GREAT DEAL OF HOSTILITY 
YOU COULD SAY THAT IT WAS IN FOR A DIG 
TIME TEAM IS AN INTERESTING PHENOMENON THERE IS A SORT OF 
A LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH IT THAT MOST ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE 
IT BECAME STRAIT JACKETED IN TO THIS SILLY BUSINESS OF RUSHING 
AROUND FIELDS AND WAVING YOUR ARMS UP AND DOWN AND DOING IT ALL IN THREE DAYS 
I CAN SEE WHY FROM A TELEVISION POINT OF VIEW 
IT CREATES TENSION AND THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING AT THE END 
BUT THAT PERVERTED THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTENT IN MY OPINION 
HAVE YOU GOT MY ROMAN ROAD NO 
SO THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE LONG TRENCH THERE IS NO ROAD 
NO NOTHING THAT'S WHERE THE LINE FROM THE MAP EVIDENCE SAID THAT THE ROAD SHOULD BE AND IT ISN'T 
PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S NOT BEING DONE PROPERLY 
I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A TIME TEAM DIGS AND LOTS OF OTHER DIGS TOO 
IT ISN'T THE CASE THAT IT'S NOT BEING DONE PROPERLY ON TIME TEAM 
THESE ARE LIKE REGULAR ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS AS WE CALL THEM WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW 
MUCH ABOUT AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE POSSIBLY THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME KIND OF DEVELOPMENT 
YOU GO IN AND YOU DO PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION 
TO FIND OUT IF THERE'S ARCHAEOLOGY THERE AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE THE DEVELOPMENT GOES AHEAD 
SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT WE NEED TO DIG A TRENCH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOOTBALL PITCH 
I'D LIKE TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE'VE DEFINITELY GOT A CLEAR RADAR RESPONSE THERE 
I SAID IT WAS CONFUSED HERE NOTHING CLEAR AT ALL 
HAVE WE GOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO DIG UP SOMEONE'S FOOTBALL PITCH 
I'M GETTING A BIT MORE WORRIED BUT THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH 
WE COULD ACTUALLY PUT A BORE HOLE INTO OUR ANOMALY AND A BORE HOLE TO THE SIDE 
AND IF WE CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE THEN 
THEN WE CAN MAKE A DECISION WHETHER IT'S WORTH DESTROYING THE PITCH 
WE HAVE ALWAYS INSISTED 
THAT ABOVE ALL THE PROGRAMME HAS GOT TO BE GOOD ARCHAEOLOGY 
IT DOESN'T MEAN THE PROGRAMME ITSELF IS ARCHAEOLOGY 
BUT THE ARCHAEOLOGY WE RECORD HAS TO BE SUPERB 
WE'RE BEING SCRUTINISED ALL THE TIME 
WE MAKE MISTAKES WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS 
BUT OUR ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE GOT THE BOTTLE TO DO THAT ON CAMERA 
IT WAS TIME TEAM THAT SHOWED JUST HOW WIDESPREAD 
THE USE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAD BECOME IN ARCHAEOLOGY 
NOT SO MUCH NOW DIG DIG DIG AS GEOPHYS GEOPHYS GEOPHYS' 
JOHN AND THE REST OF HIS TEAM AND THIS IS A FIRST FOR TIME TEAM 
ARE GOING TO TRY SOME UNDERWATER GEOPHYS WHAT EXACTLY ARE THEY GOING TO DO STUART 
THEY'LL LOOK USING GROUND PENETRATING RADAR TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND 
WHETHER THERE IS A FORD ACROSS THE RIVER THAT'S STONE SLABS LAID 
OR WHETHER THERE IS A BRIDGE THE PIERS WHICH WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED THE ROAD OVER THE RIVER 
THE RADAR THEY'RE USING WILL PENETRATE THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT 
IT WILL GO THROUGH THE WATER AND HOPEFULLY PICK UP ANY MASS OF STONE 
WHEN GLYN DANIEL AND ERM MORTIMER WERE MAKING THEIR PROGRAMMES 
YOU HAD TO DIG FOR A HELL OF A LONG TIME 
BEFORE YOU FOUND MOST OF THE STUFF THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR 
GEOPHYSICS HAS TURNED IT ON ITS HEAD 
NOT THAT IT WAS NEW TECHNOLOGY 
MOST OF IT WAS THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS AROUND IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
AND HELPED US DISCOVER THE U. BOATS BUT THE CHIP IN THE P. C. MEANT THAT SUDDENLY 
YOU COULD READ WHAT WAS UNDER A LANDSCAPE 
AND IMMEDIATELY PLUG IN TO YOUR OWN LAPTOP IN THE BACK OF A VAN 
AND YOU WOULD GET THE RESULTS THERE AND THEN 
SCIENCE WAS ALSO THE KEY TO B. B. C.'S MEET THE ANCESTORS 
THE PROGRAMME USED THE VERY LATEST FORENSIC TECHNIQUES 
TO REVEAL HOW OUR ANCESTORS LIVED AND HOW THEY DIED 
I THOUGHT MEET THE ANCESTORS WAS A VERY GOOD FORMAT INDEED 
I THINK IT HAD ITS LIMITATIONS IN THAT YOU HAD THAT EXCLUSIVE 
OR MORE OR LESS EXCLUSIVE FOCUS ON HUMAN REMAINS 
THE LID'S GOT TO COME OFF THIS ISN'T AS IT WAS PLANNED 
TAKING THE LID OFF NOW BUT NONE THE LESS IT'S A EXCITING MOMENT 
BECAUSE WHEN THIS PIECE COMES OFF 
WE'RE GOING TO GET AN IDEA AS TO WHETHER THERE'S ACTUALLY ANYBODY INSIDE OR NOT 
NOW IF YOU'RE GONNA DO A SERIES ABOUT PEOPLE 
WHAT'S THE BEST LEAD INTO DOING IT THE BEST LEAD IN TO MY MIND 
WAS TO LOOK AT THE HUMAN RAINS THE SKELETONS BECAUSE THE PHYSICAL REMAINS OF THOSE PEOPLE 
AND THEN SEE WHAT YOU COULD BUILD ON THOSE USING ALL THE TECHNIQUES 
OF INVESTIGATION DATING FORENSIC SCIENCE THINGS LIKE THAT 
IS THAT THE JAW OH SO THAT'S THE 
OH THAT'S THE UPPER JAW THERE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
WELL I THINK THAT'S RESOLVED ONE QUESTION ANYWAY 
IT DOES LOOK AS IF IT'S OCCUPIED 
JULIAN RICHARDS THE SERIES' RESIDENT ARCHAEOLOGIST 
DEALT EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE SKELETAL REMAINS OF EXISTING EXCAVATIONS 
CRITICISM COULD HAVE BEEN LEVELLED 
THAT I WAS ACTUALLY DIGGING UP BODIES TO MAKE TELEVISION PROGRAMMES 
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE 
WE'D HAVE GONE TO DIG UP A BODY TO MAKE A STORY 
THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO GO TO EXCAVATIONS THAT WERE TAKING PLACE 
IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE BECOME MORE SENSITIVE TO THE DIGGING UP OF DEAD PEOPLE 
IN MORTIMER WHEELER'S DAY THERE WERE FEWER SCRUPLES 
IF YOU DIG UP A MAN WITH BOWLS AND THINGS ALL AROUND HIM 
LIKE THOSE PEOPLE WE DUG UP AT THE EAST END OF MAIDEN CASTLE 
THEY WERE DEAD THEY'D BEEN DEAD A LONG TIME 
AND THEY WERE GOING TO BE DEAD A LONG TIME THEY ARE STILL DEAD 
BUT AROUND THEM WERE ALL SORTS OF POSSESSIONS WHICH WERE OF INTEREST TO US 
THEY HELPED US TO PUT A PIECE OF OUR HISTORY INTO PERSPECTIVE 
WHICH WE OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD AND SO ON 
THEY ENABLE US TO RECONSTRUCT THE WORLD AND THE HISTORY WITHIN WHICH WE LIVE 
AND I THINK THAT'S WORTHWHILE 
WE DO NO HARM TO THESE POOR CHAPS 
WHEN I'M DEAD YOU CAN DIG ME UP TEN TIMES FOR ALL I CARE 
LIKE TOLLUND MAN FORTY YEARS BEFORE 
MEET THE ANCESTORS TOOK US BACK IN TIME IN A VIVID REVEAL AT THE END 
OF THE PROGRAMME WE WOULD COME FACE TO FACE WITH AN ANCESTOR 
CAN WE SEE THE ROMAN I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
YES OF COURSE 
O. K. THERE'S A SMALL ANIMATION 
SHOWING THE THREE D. RECONSTRUCTED SOFT TISSUE WITH THE IMAGE NOW MAPPED ON TOP OF IT 
HE SUDDENLY LOOKS INCREDIBLY HUMAN 
I SUPPOSE THE LAST TIME I SAW IT WAS ROBIN'S RECONSTRUCTION 
WHERE IT WAS A VERY STRANGE COLOUR BUT SOMEHOW 
ALL THE FLESH TONES AND EVERYTHING JUST MAKE HIM LOOK LIKE A PERSON DON'T THEY 
IT CERTAINLY HELPED TO BRING THAT PERSON TO LIFE 
OTHERWISE YOU HAD AN ABSTRACT SERIES OF BITS OF INFORMATION 
YOU KNEW THEIR HEIGHT THEIR WEIGHT YOU KNEW IT WAS A MALE THAT THEY HAD ARTHRITIS 
THAT THEY'D LIVED AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME BUT WHAT IT WAS THE FACE WAS 
WAS SOMETHING TO HANG ALL THAT INFORMATION ON AND SAY TO PEOPLE LOOK THIS IS THAT PERSON 
AND WHAT I WAS PLEASED ABOUT WAS THAT WE SPENT THE TIME AND MONEY 
TO DO PROPER FORENSIC FACIAL RECONSTRUCTIONS RATHER THAN 
HERE'S AN ARTIST'S IMPRESSION OF WHAT THIS PERSON MIGHT HAVE LOOKED LIKE 
IT WAS AS CLOSE TO THE REAL THING AS SCIENCE WOULD ALLOW US TO GET 
AT THE TURN OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM ARCHAEOLOGY HAD SOMETHING OF A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE 
IT STARTED TO DIG UP ITS OWN PAST 
IN TWO THOUSAND ONE SURVIVING THE IRON AGE REVISITED AN OLD FORMAT 
ITS NINETEEN SEVENTIES ANCESTOR HAD BEEN A VALID SEARCH FOR KNOWLEDGE 
AND A PROTOTYPE FOR REALITY TELEVISION 
THE NEW VERSION WAS A CLONE 
FOR DECADES ARCHAEOLOGY HAD INNOVATED NOW IT IMITATED 
IF YOU'RE IN ANY DOUBT WE'D ARRIVED IN THE BIG BROTHER AGE HERE ARE A FEW CLUES 
DAY THREE AND YASMIN IS UP BUT NO HAPPIER 
BUT AS DAY FOUR DAWNS FOOD IS THE LAST THING ON ANYONE'S MIND 
WHEN WE THINK WE KNOW WHAT WE'LL DO THEY THROW SOMETHING ELSE AT US 
I'VE GOT TO CALL THEM IN FROM THE FIELDS NOW 
THE FORMAT STRUGGLED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING 
THERE WERE IRON AGE TAPS A PRODUCER WITH A MOBILE PHONE 
WE HAVE TO LOOK AFTER OURSELVES WHAT'S THAT 
WHAT'S THAT IT'S THE WOOD SPIRIT 
MARTIN YOUR DREAM 
THANK YOU BYE 
AND A VISIT TO THE PUB HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT 
THOSE PEOPLE WEREN'T LIVING IN THE IRON AGE BECAUSE OTHERWISE 
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE LACK OF RUNNING WATER 
THE LACK OF ELECTRICITY THE LACK OF REFRIGERATION FACILITIES IN A WAY THAT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO DO 
I REMEMBER BEING TAKEN THERE TO TAKE PART IN THE PENULTIMATE ONE 
IT HAD ALL THE FASCINATION FOR ME OF THE FIRST ONE 
WHERE ONE UNDERSTOOD HOW PEOPLE WERE LIVING BUT THEY WERE FAR MORE INDIVIDUALS 
AND ENCOURAGED TO BE MORE INDIVIDUALS ER INDIVIDUAL 
AND ENCOURAGED TO BE MORE QUIRKY 
ERM THERE WAS ALSO HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK 
WHICH MEANT YOU COULDN'T DO HALF THE THINGS YOU COULD IN THE EARLIER PROGRAMMES 
AS SOON AS THE PROJECT STARTED IT NEARLY CAME TO A VOMITING HALT 
TONIGHT BILL'S CHICKENS WILL COME CLOSE TO STOPPING THE PROJECT IN ITS TRACKS 
THAT'S NOT COOKED IS IT 
HAS ANYBODY TOLD ERM 
A FEW PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN VERY WELL OVERNIGHT 
WE MAY HAVE A BIT OF A CRISIS ON OUR HANDS 
HOW ARE WE TODAY NOT TOO BRIGHT 
EVERYONE'S ILL APPARENTLY 
MY TROUSERS WERE SOAKING AND I'D POOED MY TROUSERS 
I'VE JUST BEEN TO THE TOILET ABOUT FIFTEEN TIMES OVERNIGHT 
IT'S JUST LIKE WATER COMING OUT 
IT WAS CAR CRASH TELEVISION AND I USED TO WATCH IT BECAUSE 
IT WAS HYSTERICALLY FUNNY TO SEE WHAT THEY GOT WRONG THE NEXT WEEK 
ONE GOT THE FEELING CYNICALLY THAT THAT'S WHY IT HAD BEEN 
PUT TOGETHER BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO FAIL IN A SPECTACULAR WAY 
I WIPED MYSELF WITH STINGING NETTLES I DIDN'T KNOW 
OH NO I THOUGHT OH NO I COULDN'T SEE IT WAS PITCH BLACK 
I WAS JUST GRABBING ANYTHING 
THE TWO PROGRAMME WERE DIFFERENT AND I FRANKLY 
THE SECOND ONE DIDN'T WORK WHEREAS THE FIRST SERIES DID WORK 
IN TWO THOUSAND THREE IN THE QUEST FOR THE PERFECT FORMAT ARCHAEOLOGY 
WAS MARKETED AS A BREATHLESS RUSH TO FIND TREASURE 
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING OVER HERE 
GONE WAS THE IDEA OF PAINSTAKING INQUIRY HIDDEN TREASURE SIMPLY GOT IN THE METAL DETECTORS 
I SOON GOT INTO THE SWING OF THINGS WITHIN SECONDS I HAD A SIGNAL 
THE EXPERT ARCHAEOLOGISTS WERE SWAPPED FOR SOMEONE 
WHO SEEMED NEVER TO HAVE HELD A TROWEL BEFORE 
HANG ON THAT'S NOT MY RING IS IT 
HA HA HA HA 
I'M SUCH AN AMATEUR 
IF THAT WASN'T EXCITING ENOUGH TRY EXTREME ARCHAEOLOGY 
ALL OVER BRITAIN THERE ARE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES 
THAT ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO ACCESS OR EXCAVATE 
THEY COULD CONTAIN UNIQUE AND VALUABLE EVIDENCE OF OUR PAST 
WHICH IF NOT INVESTIGATED WILL BE LOST FOR EVER 
ARCHAEOLOGY WAS PRESENTED AS A DANGEROUS ACTIVITY 
WHERE LIFE LIMB AND CREDIBILITY WERE ALL UNDER THREAT 
THE TUNNELS ARE POTENTIALLY LETHAL AND THE THREAT OF COLLAPSE IS NEVER FAR AWAY 
WELL I THOUGHT THIS WAS SOLID ROCK 
FOR THINGS LIKE THAT I SIT AND WATCH IT WITH MY SON 
WHO AT THE TIME THAT CAME OUT WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN AND VERY INTERESTED IN EXTREME SPORTS 
WE SAT AND WATCHED IT EXTREME ARCHAEOLOGY HOW TO GET HIM INTERESTED IN ARCHAEOLOGY 
AND WE SAT AND WATCHED IT AND HE SORT OF SAID HALFWAY THROUGH 
THIS ISN'T EXTREME AT ALL 
THAT TAKES US TWENTY FIVE F. T. UP TO A PLATFORM THERE AND BEYOND THAT IT'S VIRGIN TERRITORY 
WE'RE GONNA FIND SOMETHING GOOD UP THERE 
YEAH HERE'S HOPING SO THE SOONER WE CAN GET A MOVE ON 
AND GET UP THIS LADDER AND GET INTO THE STUFF WE WANNA BE INTO THE BETTER 
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THAT IT WAS SO AWFUL 
ERM IT WAS DETERMINED ENTIRELY BY A FORMAT 
THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT ARCHAEOLOGY IN IT 
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH THE WORD ARCHAEOLOGY HAS BEEN KEPT BECAUSE IT'S GOT SOME CREDIBILITY 
TALKING ABOUT CREDIBILITY ON THE BACK OF DAN BROWN'S BOOK THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
HENRY LINCOLN'S WEIRD STORY OF THE HOLY GRAIL WAS DUG UP AGAIN 
BUT DID WE GET AN ARCHAEOLOGIST TO SEE IF ANY EVIDENCE MATCHED THE STORY 
WELL YES AND NO OR MORE PRECISELY NO 
WE GOT CLARKSON'S MATE THE NICE CUDDLY ONE 
RICHARD HAMMOND WHO CLEARLY SET OUT MORE TO ENTERTAIN THAN INFORM 
SO HEADS WEST TAILS NORTH 
WELL I SHAN'T BE NEEDING MY SUN CREAM I'M GOING NORTH 
THE USE OF CELEBRITIES AS THEY SAY FROM ONE FIELD 
TO INTRODUCE AND PRESENT SUBJECTS QUITE OTHER THAN ONE THEY'RE KNOWN ABOUT 
HAS SOME JUSTIFICATION BECAUSE WHAT IT CAN DO IS THAT THAT 
CELEBRITY CAN DRAW IN PEOPLE FROM THE POP WORLD OR WHATEVER IT IS 
TO LOOK AT ARCHAEOLOGY OR NATURAL HISTORY OR ANY OTHER SUBJECT 
WHO WOULD NOT NORMALLY LOOK AT IT 
SO THAT'S A WAY OF 
A VALUABLE THING TO DO AND PERFECTLY VALID I THINK 
FROM ITS EARLIEST BEGINNINGS T. V. ARCHAEOLOGY HAS NEVER BEEN AFRAID 
TO USE SHOWMANSHIP TO ADD ZIP TO A GOOD STORY 
BUT AT ITS BEST THE MAIN ROLE OF TELEVISION ARCHAEOLOGY WILL ALWAYS BE TO REVEAL NEW EVIDENCE 
FASCINATING US AND CONNECTING US TO OUR ANCESTORS 
AFTER BEING BURIED FOR NEARLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
ONLY NOW IS THIS LOST CITY BEING UNEARTHED 
COCOONED FOR CENTURIES BENEATH VOLCANIC DEBRIS 
HERCULANEUM GROWS MORE AND MORE UNSTABLE AS IT'S UNCOVERED 
AFTER YEARS OF NEGLECT THE TEAM RACE TO CONSERVE THE SITE 
BEFORE THE TOWN'S PRICELESS ARTEFACTS ARE LOST FOREVER 
WOODEN BEAMS ARE SOME OF THE REALLY RARE FEATURES OF THIS SITE 
AND IT'S NOT JUST WOOD ALL SORTS OF IT ORGANIC MATERIALS SURVIVE 
HERE FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE A WICKER BASKET 
PERHAPS FOR FISHING WE DON'T KNOW QUITE WHAT 
AND HERE ONE OF THE REALLY ASTONISHING FINDS FROM THE SITE 
A ROMAN LOAF A ROMAN LOAF DIVIDED INTO ITS LITTLE SLICES OF BREAD 
WHICH ACTUALLY HAS THE NAME OF THE GUY WHO WAS GOING TO CONSUME IT STAMPED ON IT 
YOU CAN SEE AN A OR A V. AND AN M. THERE 
WHAT YOU DID WAS YOU PUT YOUR NAME ON SO YOU GET THE RIGHT LOAF 
BACK OUT OF THE OVEN 
ARCHAEOLOGY TELLS THE GREATEST STORY THAT'S EVER 
THAT THERE IS THE STORY OF MANKIND 
THE STORY OF MANKIND'S FRUSTRATIONS PERILS AND ACHIEVEMENTS 
AND WHAT GREATER STORY IS THERE
