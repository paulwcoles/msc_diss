I DEMAND YOU BREAK DOWN THAT DOOR AND ARREST HIM I WILL DECIDE WHO IS ARRESTED AND WHO IS NOT 
WE'VE RECEIVED A CALL INVOLVING A POSSIBLE PUBLIC ORDER OFFENCE 
SO I NEED TO QUESTION MR. ARDEN 
AND IF HE'S RESPONSIBLE I'LL ARREST HIM WAIT 
I KNOW LES IS A PAIN BUT THERE'S A REASON BEHIND HIS BEHAVIOUR 
DON'T JUST SEE HIM AS AN EX CON 
I'M LIVING NEXT DOOR TO A CRIMINAL OH YOU MUST ARREST HIM 
HE'S RUINING MY THERAPY WORK HE'S OUT OF CONTROL 
SO YOU'RE A THERAPIST RIGHT SO WELL LAST TIME I CHECKED THAT WAS A CARING PROFESSION 
LES IS OLD AND SICK PRECISELY THE SORT OF PERSON YOU SHOULD BE HELPING 
IF MR. ARDEN HAS COMMITTED A CRIME HE'LL BE ARRESTED 
WAIT PLEASE BEFORE YOU GO IN JUST LET ME HAVE A WORD WITH HIM 
SEE IF I CAN BRING HIM OUT QUIETLY 
I'M SO SORRY 
ARCH IS THAT YOU 
YEAH IT'S ME 
ARCHIE THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING 
IF YOU COULD JUST 
LES YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP USING ME LIKE THIS 
YOU'VE GOT TO FACE UP TO I CAN'T COME OUT 
THEN LET ME IN 
BUT I KNOW WHERE YOU'VE BEEN 
AND I KNOW ALL ABOUT JUDY TOO 
I SAW THE NAME ON THE RECORDS THEN YOUR TATTOO 
I HAD A HUNCH SO I GOT IN TOUCH WITH YOUR OLD G. P. 
MY JUDY LOVED MUSIC 
ESPECIALLY EDDIE COCHRAN 
I NEED TO HEAR HER RECORDS 
IT'S A GOOD JOB SHE'S DEAD 
SHE'D BE ASHAMED OF ME NOW THE STATE I'VE GOT INTO 
BUT THAT'S JUST IT LES 
IT'S THE GRIEF THAT'S GOT YOU LIKE THIS 
DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS 
NOT IF SERGEANT ROBERTS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT 
IN HER MIND ONCE A CRIMINAL ALWAYS A CRIMINAL 
WELL I DESERVE TO GO BACK INSIDE ANYWAY I AS GOOD AS KILLED JUDY 
OR TOOK HER WHOLE LIFE SAME THING I RECKON 
LOOK I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE IN PAIN 
BUT YOU ARE IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR JUDY'S DEATH 
LOOK NO OFFENCE MATE BUT YOU'RE JUST A KID 
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND 
FORTY FOUR YEARS WE WERE WED 
IT'S IMPRESSIVE AIN'T IT 
EVEN IF I WAS LOCKED UP FOR HALF OF IT 
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE A WOMAN 
I'VE BEEN THIEVING EVER SINCE I WAS IN SHORT TROUSERS 
I JACKED IN THE BOXING AND GRADUATED STRAIGHT INTO ARMED BANK ROBBERY 
ALWAYS TAKE THE EASY OPTION ME 
PROBLEM IS WHAT STARTS OUT BEING THE EASY ROAD 
ENDS UP BEING THE HARDEST 
I THINK IT WAS THE STRESS OF ME BEING ALWAYS INSIDE WHICH FINISHED JUDY OFF IN THE END 
SHE DIED ONE WEEK BEFORE I WAS RELEASED 
THEY LET ME OUT EARLY 
FOR THE FUNERAL 
AFTER THAT I CAME HERE 
I THOUGHT IF I WERE TO MOVE IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO FORGET 
FAT CHANCE 
TODAY WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR FORTY FIFTH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY 
I THINK IT'S VERY FITTING THAT I SHOULD GET NICKED 
TODAY OF ALL DAYS IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL 
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER GO OUT THERE AND FACE ROBERTS 
DON'T LET THEM DRAG YOU OUT 
THE GUY WHO WON THESE TROPHIES HE NEVER LOST A FIGHT 
THE KID THAT WON THOSE IS LONG GONE ALONG WITH HIS FAMOUS GUTS 
BUT YOU'RE NOT ON YOUR OWN 
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF EVERY GREAT FIGHTER NEEDS A TRAINER 
AND TO FIGHT THIS GRIEF YOU NEED A THERAPIST I CAN HELP WITH THAT 
THERE'S NO POINT LES I PROMISE YOU WE'LL GET YOU WELL AGAIN 
BUT FIRST OF ALL WE'VE GOT TO GO OUT THERE AND FACE THE POLICE 
THE OLD CHAMP'S DOWN ALL RIGHT 
BUT I RECKON HE'S GOT ENOUGH FIGHT LEFT IN HIM TO GET OFF THE CANVAS ONE LAST TIME WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
COME ON MR. ARDEN LET'S GO 
SERGEANT ROBERTS HE'S UPSET 
SO I RECEIVED A REPORT OF ASSAULT CRIMINAL DAMAGE 
AND IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE PRIME SUSPECT IS 
AT LEAST I'LL GET SOME PEACE AND QUIET NOW 
IT'S A CRY FOR HELP YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THAT 
WAIT COME TO GLOAT NO I'VE MADE A MISTAKE 
EXCUSE ME 
I DON'T WANT TO PRESS ANY CHARGES 
THAT'S NOT YOUR DECISION ANY MORE MR. ARDEN'S COMING SERGEANT I DAMAGED THE FEATURE 
I KNOCKED IT OVER FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT THOUGHT IT WAS LES 
WE HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING ON 
WHICH IS ALL DOWN TO ME DO YOU ACTUALLY EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED 
WASTING POLICE TIME IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER 
IF I DON'T WANT TO PURSUE THIS THAT'S MY CALL RIGHT 
YOU TWO BETTER PRAY YOU DON'T RUN INTO ME AGAIN 
NO DOUBT SEE YOU SOON MR. ARDEN TA RA SERGEANT 
THANK YOU ARCH YOU ARE A GOOD LAD

YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER
