GORDON BROWN SAYS LABOUR CAN 
RECOVER AFTER ITS WORST DEFEAT IN 
YEARS HE ADMITS HE HAS MADE 
MISTAKES SAYS HE FEELS PEOPLE'S 
HURT BUT INSISTS HE'S STILL THE 
RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB 
I UNDERSTAND 
WHAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING AND I 
UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING 
AND I BELIEVE I'M THE RIGHT PERSON 
TO TAKE THE COUNTRY THROUGH THESE 
DIFFICULTY TIMES 
THE TWO SMALL 
BOYS FOUND DEAD IN CAR NEAR GLASGOW 
POLICE CONFIRM THEY ARE TREATING IT 
AS MURDER 
A CYCLONE HITS BURMA THERE IS 
DEVASTATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
LASSITER ARE RELEGATED BUT STOKE 
ARE PROMOTED TO THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR LABOUR'S POOR 
PERFORMANCE IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS 
AND HAS ADMITTED MAKING MISTAKES 
OVER RECENT MONTHS BUT SPEAKING AT 
A B. B. C. INTERVIEW MR. BROWN INSISTED 
TODAY HE WOULD NOT BE PUT OFF BY A 
FEW DAYS HEADLINES AND SAID HE 
UNDERSTOOD VOTERS' CONCERNS IT HAS 
BEEN A TERRIBLE FEW DAYS FOR THE 
PRIME MINISTER AND ONE M. P. TOLD THE 
B. B. C. TODAY IF HE CAN'T HANDLE 
NUMBER TEN HE SHOULD JUST GET OUT 
BUT ANOTHER SAID THAT LABOUR HAS 
LOST THE KNACK FOR TELLING ITS 
STORY IN AN INTERVIEW TODAY THE 
PRIME MINISTER TRIED TO START THE 
NEXT CHAPTER GORDON BROWN CAME 
FORWARD TODAY TO ADMIT HIS OWN 
FAILINGS FACING DEMANDS FROM HIS 
OWN SIDE THAT HE SHOW A DIFFERENT 
FASHION THE P. M. ACCEPTED SOME OF THE 
BLAME SO HE STEPPED OUT OF HIS 
COMFORT ZONE AND INTO THE T. V. STUDIO 
FOR HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE 
THURSDAY'S ELECTION DISASTER THE 
P. M. HAS BEEN HURT BY DEFEAT BUT 
SAYS HE UNDERSTANDS THE PUBLIC'S 
PAIN 
I FEEL THE HURT THEY FEEL PAIN PETROL PRICES GONE UP FOOD PRICES 
GONE UP THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE 
UTILITY BILLS THEY ARE WORRIED 
ABOUT THE STANDARD OF LIVING THERE 
IS AN UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
I HAVE DEALT WITH SOME OF THESE 
PROBLEMS AS CHANCELLOR WE HAVE TO 
SHOW THERE IS A CLEAR UNEQUIVOCAL 
DIRECTION THAT WE HAVE 
AN ECONOMIC 
PLAN TO TAKE US THROUGH THESE 
THINGS WITH MANY LABOUR M. P.'S 
DISPAIRING OF 
THE PICTURE THE 
PUBLIC NOW HAS OF LABOUR GORDON 
BROWN DECIDED TO PUT HIMSELF IN THE 
FRAME AMID ACCUSATIONS THAT HE AND 
HIS TEAM ARE IN DENIAL HE DIDN'T 
FIND IT EASY BUT ADMITTED THERE WAS 
MISTAKES 
PEOPLE SENSE WE HAVE MADE MISTAKES MISTAKES THE TEN P. RATE 
ANY OTHER 
MISTAKES 
I THINK MYSELF IF I WAS MISTAKES TO LOOK BACK ON THE LAST YEAR I 
WOULD SAY I LET SPECULATION ABOUT 
THE GENERAL ELECTION GO TOO LONG I 
ADMITTED THAT WAS A PROBLEM THAT 
WAS THERE PERHAPS I HAVE SPENT TOO 
LITTLE TIME THINKING ABOUT HOW WE 
CAN GET OUR ARGUMENTS ACROSS TO THE 
PUBLIC NOW OF COURSE I THINK 
PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING LOOK CAN YOU 
SHOW US THAT YOU CAN COME THROUGH 
THESE DIFFICULT SITUATIONS I 
BELIEVE WE WILL 
GORDON BROWN 
APPEARED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE'S 
PART OF LABOUR'S PROBLEM 
I THINK 
IT IS TRUE I'M A MORE PRIVATE 
PERSON IN THE PUBLIC ARENA PERHAPS 
I HAVE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME AS YOU 
HAVE SAID YOURSELF LOOKING AT THE 
DETAIL OF SOLVING PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS 
BUT 
TO SOLVE 
PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS YOU 
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PROBLEMS 
I 
THINK IF 
I COMMUNICATE TO PEOPLE 
THAT GOING 
ROUND THE COUNTRY 
I 
LISTENING TO WHAT PEOPLE 
ARE SAYING 
I HAVE HEARD 
WHAT PEOPLE 
HAVE 
I HAVE HEARD WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID HE DISMISSED 
RUMOURS OF PLANS TO 
PUSH HIM OUT SAYING HE'S 
BEST FOR THE 
JOB 
DO YOU EXPECT 
TO FACE 
A LEADERSHIP 
CHALLENGE I DON'T THINK SO CHALLENGE BECAUSE I THINK WE GET ON WITH THE 
JOB WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE 
TO M. P.'S 
JOB SAYING 
IN THE 
PAPERS THAT IT IS 
TIME FOR A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE 
I DON'T THINK 
MANY M. P.'S 
ARE 
THAT AND THE KEY ISSUE IS HOW TO 
COME THROUGH THE CURRENT ECONOMIC 
CHALLENGES THAT FACE THE COUNTRY I 
BELIEVE I'M THE BEST PERSON 
TO TAKE 
THE COUNTRY WITH ALISTAIR DARLING 
THE CHANCELLOR THROUGH THESE 
CHALLENGES HOW CAN WE BUILD FOR 
THE FUTURE L. BELIEVE I'M SETTING DOWN THAT ARE THE 
RIGHT POLICIES 
FOR THE 
FUTURE YOU 
WILL SEE OVER THE WEEKS ALL 
DIFFERENT ISSUES 
HOW WE 
ARE 
SETTING OUT THE 
POLICIES FOR 
THE 
FUTURE I BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE 
CHOICE 
IS THERE 
BETWEEN 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND THE LABOUR 
PARTY AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT 
THE CONSERVATIVE POLICIES WHAT THEY 
ARE ACTUALLY SAYING NOT JUST THE 
SALESMANSHIP WHAT THEY ARE 
ACTUALLY SAYING IT WILL BE VERY 
CLEAR THAT LABOUR IS THE PARTY ON 
THE SIDE OF THE HARD WORKING 
FAMILIES 
THERE IS NO SERIOUS TALK FAMILIES YET OF ANY OTHER LABOUR POLITICIAN 
PUTTING THEMSELVES IN THE 
LEADERSHIP FRAME BUT NO SIGNS SO 
FAR EITHER OF GORDON BROWN PUSHING 
HIS CRITICS AWAY BUT SAYING HE 
FEELS THE PUBLIC'S PAIN MIGHT NOT 
BE ENOUGH IF GORDON BROWN IS TO GET 
HIMSELF OUT OF THIS HOLE THERE 
HAVE BEEN HINTS ABOUT TAX TODAY AND 
PROMISES OF NEW POLICIES BUT IT'S 
NOT YET CLEAR WHAT CONCRETE 
MEASURES GORDON BROWN WILL TAKE TO 
TRY TO TURN THIS AROUND 
MICROSOFT HAS PULLED OUT OF A DEAL TO BUY YAHOO THE OFFER WAS 
REJECTED BECAUSE IT WASN'T ENOUGH 
IN TRYING TO BUY YAHOO MICROSOFT 
WANTED TO SET UP A RIVAL TO GOOGLE 
WHICH DOMINATES THE MARKET OF 
INTERNET ADVERTISING WHILE SOME 
YAHOO EXECUTIVES MIGHT BE 
CELEBRATING THEIR CONTINUED 
INDEPENDENCE TODAY HAVING SEEN OFF 
MICROSOFT'S UNWANTED ATTENTIONS 
THEY MIGHT ALREADY BEEN DREADING 
STOCK MARKETS OPENING TOMORROW 
YAHOO SHARES ARE SET TO DIP UP TO 
AIRED THIS BOTH MICROSOFT AND 
YAHOO HAVE COME A LONG WAY SINCE 
BEING FORMED IN GARAGES BOTH SETS 
HAVE EARNED BILLIONS ALONG THE WAY 
WHAT WAS IN IT FOR THEM TO MERGE 
THE REAL TARGET OF THIS WAS GOOGLE 
THEY HAVE CRACKED INTERNET 
ADVERTISING BY PROVIDING REALLY 
GOOD INTERNET SEARCH RESULTS THEY 
GET MILLIONS IN AND ATTRACT 
ADVERTISERS ADVERTISERS MICROSOFT THOUGHT THAT BY BUYING 
YAHOO THEY WOULD GET THE NUMBERS 
GOOGLE ARE SAID TO HAVE AN 
ADVERTISING REVENUE OF TWENTY BILLION 
IT IS SAID TO EARN MORE FROM 
ADVERTS THAN BRITAIN'S LARGEST 
BROADCASTER I. T. V. 
WHERE NOW FOR THE 
TWO COMPANIES YAHOO IS EXPECTED TO 
LOOK FOR TIE UPS WITH MYSPACE BUT 
INTEREST HAS COOLED SOME WHAT 
ALTERNATIVE LEAH YAHOO MAY LOOK TO 
MERGE WITH A. O. L. OWNED BY TIME 
WARNER BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO MOVE 
FAST BECAUSE A. O. L. MIGHT ALSO BE 
UNDER MICROSOFT'S RADAR BILL GATES 
AND CO MAY PREFER TO BUY UP SMALLER 
TECH COMPANIES IN THE HOPE OF 
STUMBLING UPON THE NEXT KILLER 
APPLICATION TO MAKE SERIOUS MONEY 
WHILST THE YAHOO MICROSOFT DEAL IS 
UNTANGLING IT IS UNLIKELY GOOGLE 
WILL REMAIN UNCHALLENGED BUT 
CONSUMER GROUPS HAVE EXPRESSED 
CONCERN ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF DATA 
HELD BY GOOGLE ON SYSTEMS LIKE THIS 
ONE THAT WILL GET WORSE IS GOOGLE 
CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE ON LINE 
ADVERTISING MARKET
