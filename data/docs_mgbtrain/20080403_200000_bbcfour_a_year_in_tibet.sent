FOR NEARLY SIX HUNDRED YEARS THE PEL KOR MONASTERY IN GYANTSE 
SOUTHERN TIBET HAS BEEN A CENTRE OF BUDDHIST LEARNING AND MEDITATION 
TIBET IS PART OF A MODERNISING CHINA 
ALTHOUGH GOVERNED FROM BEIJING 
IT'S NO LONGER ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD 
IN THIS LAST EPISODE WE SEE HOW LIFE IS CHANGING FOR EVERYONE 
THROUGH THE STORIES OF THREE MONKS 
TSULTRIM HAS TO FACE UP TO THE REALITIES 
OF RUNNING THE MONASTERY UNDER STRICT GOVERNMENT CONTROL 
DONDRUP ONE OF THE OLDEST MONKS 
HAS WITNESSED THE WORST EXCESSES OF CHINESE RULE 
NOW HE PREPARES FOR HIS NEXT LIFE 
THE YOUNGEST MONK IS TSEPHUN 
HIS RELATIONS WITH DONDRUP HIS MASTER AND TEACHER 
FALL TO AN ALL TIME LOW 
NOW HE'S FACING THE ULTIMATE DISGRACE 
IT'S LATE SUMMER TWO THOUSAND SIX 
THE PEL KOR MONASTERY IS CENTRAL TO LIFE IN GYANTSE 
TIBET'S THIRD LARGEST TOWN 
FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS TIBET HAS BEEN UNDER STRICT CHINESE COMMUNIST RULE 
DURING THAT TIME LIFE IN THE MONASTERIES HAS SEEN DRAMATIC CHANGE 
THE DEPUTY HEAD LAMA IS TSULTRIM 
AS THE ACCOUNTANT TSULTRIM HAS TO BALANCE THE BOOKS 
AND HE PAYS THE MONKS OUT OF ENTRANCE FEES AND DONATIONS 
THE YOUNGEST MONKS GET ABOUT TWENTY A MONTH 
DONDRUP GETS NEARLY FOUR TIMES AS MUCH 
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHEN HE STARTED SEVENTY YEARS AGO 
LONG BEFORE CHINESE RULE 
SEVENTY YEARS ON DONDRUP IS NOW TSEPHUN'S MASTER 
AND IT'S HIS JOB TO PASS ON THE BUDDHA'S TEACHINGS TO HIS YOUNG NOVICE 
WITHOUT DONDRUP TSEPHUN MIGHT NEVER HAVE GOT INTO THE MONASTERY 
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS WORRIED ABOUT THE INFLUENCE 
THE MONASTERIES HAVE IN TIBET 
ONE WAY THEY EXERT CONTROL IS TO STRICTLY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF MONKS 
THERE USED TO BE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MONKS AT THE PEL KOR MONASTERY 
TODAY THERE ARE FEWER THAN EIGHTY 
AND TSULTRIM CONSTANTLY STRUGGLES TO FIND ENOUGH MONKS TO PERFORM THE BIG CEREMONIES 
TODAY EVERY PROSPECTIVE MONK IS VETTED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
IT'S A PROCESS THAT CAN TAKE SEVERAL YEARS 
SO IT WAS A GREAT HONOUR FOR TSEPHUN'S FAMILY 
WHEN HE BECAME A NOVICE OVER THREE YEARS AGO 
BUT HE HAS TO PROVE TO THE MONASTERY 
THAT HE WILL MAKE A GOOD MONK BEFORE HIS APPOINTMENT IS MADE OFFICIAL 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DONDRUP AND TSEPHUN HAS NEVER BEEN EASY 
WHEN HE'S NOT LOOKING AFTER HIS MASTER 
TSEPHUN SHOULD BE SPENDING ALL HIS TIME LEARNING SACRED TEXTS 
BUT THIS TEENAGER FINDS IT HARD TO CONCENTRATE 
AND IT'S GOING TO GET HIM INTO SERIOUS TROUBLE 
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF SACRED TEXTS TO LEARN 
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION CAUSED TURMOIL THROUGHOUT CHINA 
MAO'S RED GUARDS WENT ON THE RAMPAGE 
AND DESTROYED MANY OF THESE ANCIENT SCRIPTURES 
IT WAS A TRAUMATIC TIME FOR EVERYBODY IN CHINA 
TSEPHUN IS STILL TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND DONDRUP'S EXPERIENCE 
DURING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION 
CHANTING PRAYERS IS CENTRAL TO A MONK'S DAILY LIFE 
AND THEY START BEFORE DAWN 
MANY OF THE SCRIPTURES HERE ARE VERY OLD 
AND TSULTRIM SPENDS A LOT OF HIS TIME LOOKING AFTER THEM 
THE SCRIPTURES ARE THE TEACHINGS OF BUDDHA 
AND THEY'RE CENTRAL TO A MONK'S UNDERSTANDING OF HIS FAITH 
A YOUNG MONK HAS DIED SUDDENLY AND TSULTRIM HAS TO ORGANISE THE FUNERAL 
JUST ANOTHER OF HIS MANY RESPONSIBILITIES 
THIS IS GOING TO BE TSEPHUN'S FIRST SKY BURIAL 
IT'S THE MORNING OF THE CEREMONY 
AND THE SKY BURIAL MASTER IS READY TO RECEIVE THE BODY 
THE SKY BURIAL USUALLY TAKES PLACE THREE DAYS AFTER DEATH 
THE BODY IS FIRST WASHED AND THEN PLACED IN A POSITION OF MEDITATION 
IT'S A DANGEROUS TIME BETWEEN DEATH AND REBIRTH 
BUDDHISTS BELIEVE IT CAN TAKE UP TO SEVEN WEEKS 
FOR THE SOUL OF THE DECEASED TO BE REBORN 
THE RELATIVES ASKED US NOT TO FILM THE REAL CEREMONY 
THEY FEARED THE SOUL OF THE DEAD MONK COULD BECOME TOO INTERESTED 
IN THE FILMING PROCESS AND DELAY HIS DEPARTURE TO THE NEXT LIFE 
FAMILY MEMBERS DON'T COME TO THE CEREMONY 
THEIR GRIEF WOULD HOLD BACK THE SOUL AND SLOW DOWN ITS JOURNEY TO THE NEXT LIFE 
THE SKY BURIAL MASTER IS SKILLED AT DISSECTING THE BODY 
FOR ONCE THE VULTURES AREN'T BEING FED HUMAN REMAINS 
IT'S EARLY WINTER A TIME OF PILGRIMAGE IN TIBET 
DONDRUP'S COMING TO THE END OF HIS LIFE BUT AS LONG AS HE CAN STILL TRAVEL 
THERE ARE PLACES HE WANTS TO GO TO GAIN MERIT 
HE ALSO KNOWS THAT IF TSEPHUN'S GOING TO MAKE THE GRADE AS A MONK 
HE HAS TO BE INSPIRED 
SO THEY'RE OFF ON A PILGRIMAGE TOGETHER 
BUT FIRST THEY HAVE TO MAKE THEMSELVES PRESENTABLE 
BUDDHIST MONKS AND NUNS KEEP THEIR HEADS SHAVEN 
AS A SYMBOL THAT THEY'VE RENOUNCED THE MATERIAL WORLD 
THEY'RE OFF TO A FAMOUS MONASTERY 
BUT TSEPHUN'S JUST FOUND OUT THERE'S ANOTHER PART TO THE TRIP 
BEFORE THEY GET TO LHASA DONDRUP WANTS TO MAKE A PILGRIMAGE 
TO ONE OF TIBET'S OLDEST AND MOST IMPORTANT MONASTERIES 
THE GANDEN MONASTERY WAS FOUNDED SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
BUT DURING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION IT WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED 
THIS IS JUST ONE OF OVER SIX THOUSAND MONASTERIES 
THAT WERE RANSACKED AT THIS TIME 
HOWEVER MOST OF THE BUILDINGS HAVE NOW BEEN RESTORED 
MOST OF THE PRICELESS STATUES AND PAINTINGS AT GANDEN 
WERE LOST DURING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION 
GANDEN IS ONE OF THE THREE GREAT TEACHING MONASTERIES IN TIBET 
THE PRESENT DALAI LAMA TOOK HIS FINAL EXAMS HERE IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT 
JUST A YEAR BEFORE FLEEING INTO EXILE 
THERE USED TO BE OVER SIX THOUSAND MONKS HERE 
TODAY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT RESTRICTS THE NUMBERS TO JUST A FEW HUNDRED 
NEXT STOP IS LHASA 
IT'S TSEPHUN'S FIRST VISIT TO THE CAPITAL 
AND IT'S GOING TO LEAVE A BIG IMPRESSION ON HIM 
THE JOKHANG TEMPLE IS IN THE CENTRE OF LHASA AND DATES FROM 
THE SEVENTH CENTURY WHEN BUDDHISM FIRST CAME TO THE REGION 
TODAY IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SACRED PILGRIMAGE SITES IN TIBET 
THERE'S LITTLE LEFT OF THE OLD LHASA AND THIS MODERN CITY 
IS GOING TO LEAVE A LASTING EFFECT ON THE YOUNG NOVICE MONK 
DONDRUP IS GOING TO REGRET THE DAY HE EVER TOOK TSEPHUN TO LHASA 
IT'S FEBRUARY THE END OF THE TIBETAN YEAR 
AND TSEPHUN IS BACK FROM THE BRIGHT LIGHTS 
THE MONKS ARE PREPARING FOR LOSAR TIBETAN NEW YEAR 
AND TSEPHUN'S DOING HIS BIT TO HELP 
BUT AFTER THEIR PILGRIMAGE TOGETHER 
THINGS ARE NO BETTER BETWEEN DONDRUP AND HIS YOUNG NOVICE 
THE MONKS ARE MAKING TORMAS 
BUTTER SCULPTURES IN THE SHAPE OF DELICATE FLOWERS 
IT'S ALL PART OF THEIR ELABORATE PREPARATIONS FOR NEW YEAR 
AS USUAL TSULTRIM IS RUNNING THE SHOW 
TSULTRIM HAS BEEN WORRIED ABOUT TSEPHUN'S BEHAVIOUR 
SINCE HE GOT BACK FROM LHASA 
IT'S GETTING CLOSE TO NEW YEAR 
AND TSEPHUN HAS A RARE CHANCE TO GO BACK HOME 
BUT HE CAN'T GET AWAY FROM HIS MASTER THAT EASILY 
TSEPHUN COMES FROM A LARGE FARMING FAMILY 
WHO LIVE JUST OUTSIDE GYANTSE 
LIKE MANY WOMEN IN THIS PART OF TIBET 
TSEPHUN'S MOTHER IS MARRIED TO THREE BROTHERS 
ANY ONE OF THEM COULD BE TSEPHUN'S REAL FATHER 
TSEPHUN'S FATHER HAS BROUGHT SOME MONKS 
FROM THE PEL KOR MONASTERY INCLUDING DONDRUP 
IF THEY CAN AFFORD IT MOST TIBETAN FAMILIES 
INVITE MONKS INTO THEIR HOME ONCE A YEAR FOR A BLESSING 
IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MONKS TO EARN SOMETHING EXTRA AND HAVE A GOOD MEAL 
THE NEW YEAR IS OVER AND DONDRUP WANTS TO MAKE ONE LAST PILGRIMAGE 
IT'S SOMEWHERE HE'S ALWAYS WANTED TO GO 
BUT THERE'S BEEN A BURGLARY AT THE MONASTERY 
AND UNTIL THE THIEVES ARE CAUGHT LEAVING IS A PROBLEM 
NOW TSEPHUN HAS TO GET PERMISSION FROM THE POLICE FOR THEM TO TRAVEL 
TSULTRIM'S IN LHASA TO SEE HIS BROTHER 
BUT FIRST HE HAS SOME SHOPPING TO DO 
DONDRUP HAS DECIDED TO BREAK THEIR JOURNEY 
AT THE SACRED SITE OF A MOUNTAIN DEITY 
THE FLAGS HAVE MANTRAS AND PRAYERS WRITTEN ON THEM DEDICATED TO DIFFERENT DEITIES 
THEY'RE BEST SUSPENDED IN HIGH PLACES WHERE THE MESSAGES WILL BE CARRIED AWAY ON THE WIND 
TSULTRIM'S BROTHER GESANG 
IS A SENIOR MONK IN CHARGE OF SECURITY AT THE POTALA PALACE 
THE BUILDING WAS SPARED THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION 
ALL OF THE THOUSANDS OF PRICELESS STATUES AND TAPESTRIES HERE SURVIVED INTACT 
THERE'S JUST ONE LAST THING TSULTRIM'S BROTHER WANTS TO SHOW HIM 
LAKE NAMTSO IS ONE OF THE MOST SACRED SITES IN TIBET 
AT NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND METRES ABOVE SEA LEVEL THAT'S OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET 
IT'S THE HIGHEST SALT WATER LAKE IN THE WORLD 
THIS IS TSEPHUN'S LAST CHANCE TO SHOW HIS MASTER 
THAT HE'S COMMITTED TO BECOMING A MONK 
DONDRUP WANTS TSEPHUN TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT DHARMA 
IT'S MORE THAN JUST THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF BUDDHISM 
IT'S A PROFOUND UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF EXISTENCE 
NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN EASILY EXPLAIN TO A BORED TEENAGER 
TSEPHUN IS BACK AT THE MONASTERY JUST IN TIME FOR SPRING CLEANING 
THE SCRIPTURES ARE IN NEED OF SOME TENDER LOVING CARE 
THIS TIME IT'S CHOEPHEL THE DIRECTOR OF THE MONASTERY WHO'S IN CHARGE 
THE PILGRIMAGE TO THE LAKE WAS NOT A GREAT SUCCESS 
DONDRUP IS FURIOUS 
HE'S JUST FOUND SOME DAMNING EVIDENCE IN TSEPHUN'S ROOM 
AND HE'S ASKED HIS FATHER TO COME TO THE MONASTERY 
THIS COULD BE THE END FOR THE YOUNG NOVICE 
DONDRUP IS IN NO MOOD FOR EXCUSES 
WHEN TIMES ARE TOUGH TSEPHUN RETREATS TO HIS FAVOURITE NOODLE BAR 
TSEPHUN'S FATHER HAS EVERY REASON TO BE WORRIED ABOUT HIS SON'S FUTURE 
TSEPHUN'S FATHER IS RIGHT 
TIMES ARE CHANGING 
AND MANY OF THE YOUNGER MONKS ARE GIVING TSULTRIM PROBLEMS TOO 
BUT SOMEHOW HE HAS TO ORGANISE WHAT FEW MONKS HE HAS FOR THE BUDDHA'S BIRTHDAY 
THE MONKS ARE MAKING THE CENTREPIECES OF THE FESTIVAL THE MANDALAS 
THEY HELP THEM TO FOCUS ON BUDDHA'S TEACHINGS DURING MEDITATION 
AND INVOKE THE BLESSINGS OF THE DEITIES 
THE LAYOUT HAS TO BE GEOMETRICALLY PRECISE 
THE OUTER CIRCLE CONTAINS IMAGES OF HUMAN SUFFERING ON EARTH 
THE PATTERNS DRAW THE MIND INTO THE MANDALA'S CENTRE 
WHERE THE MONKS MEDITATE ON THE MEANING OF EMPTINESS 
AN ESSENTIAL STAGE ON THE ROAD TO SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT 
FINDING THE GIRL'S HAIR GRIPS IN TSEPHUN'S ROOM 
IS THE LAST STRAW FOR DONDRUP 
THE MONKS ARE ABOUT TO START THE MAIN PERFORMANCE FOR THE BUDDHA'S BIRTHDAY THE CHAM DANCE 
BUT TSULTRIM'S FACING AN ACUTE SHORTAGE OF MONKS 
SO TSEPHUN IS SAFE FOR THE MOMENT 
THE CHAM DANCE TAKES PLACE OVER SEVERAL DAYS 
IT'S AN ANCIENT PERFORMANCE 
WHERE THE MONKS INVOKE THE PROTECTION OF BENEVOLENT DEITIES 
THIS IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE YEAR FOR THE PEOPLE OF GYANTSE 
IT'S AN ESCAPE FROM THE HARDSHIPS OF DAILY LIFE AND A CHANCE TO SHOW 
THEIR RESPECT FOR THE MONKS AND THEIR REVERENCE TO THE MONASTERY 
IT'S COMING TO THE END OF SAGA DAWA 
THE DAY BEFORE THE BUDDHA'S ACTUAL BIRTHDAY 
IT'S TAKEN FORTY MONKS FIVE DAYS TO MAKE THE THREE MANDALAS 
DESTROYING THEM SO QUICKLY IS A REMINDER TO THE FAITHFUL OF THE TRANSIENT NATURE OF LIFE 
EVERYTHING HAS A VALUE 
AND THE MANDALA SANDS STILL HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY 
POURING THE MANDALA SANDS INTO THE RIVER 
WILL ENSURE THAT THE WATER DEITIES ARE PLACATED 
AND THE MONKS PRAY THAT IT WILL BRING THE PEOPLE OF GYANTSE RAIN LATER IN THE YEAR 
IT'S THE END OF MAY THE NIGHT BEFORE 
THE FULL MOON OF THE FOURTH MONTH IN THE TIBETAN CALENDAR 
IT'S THE CLIMAX OF SAGA DAWA 
AND FOR TSULTRIM IT'S COMING TO THE END OF A MONTH'S HARD WORK 
TSULTRIM HAS ONE LAST JOB TO RAISE THE PEL KOR THANGKA 
IT'S A PRICELESS TAPESTRY WEIGHING OVER A TON 
LOCAL VILLAGERS HAVE COME OUT TO HELP 
THE THANGKA HAS TO BE CARRIED UP THE HILLSIDE 
TO THE FOOT OF THE WALLS OF THE MONASTERY 
THE TAPESTRY IS THE SIZE OF FOUR TENNIS COURTS 
IT'S AN HOUR BEFORE DAWN 
BUT ALREADY THE PEOPLE OF GYANTSE HAVE COME TO PRAY 
THIS IS A TRIPLE CELEBRATION IT HONOURS THE DAY THE BUDDHA WAS BORN 
THE DAY HE FOUND ENLIGHTENMENT AND THE DAY THAT HE DIED 
IT'S SAID THAT EVERY MERIT EARNED AND EVERY STEP TAKEN ON A PILGRIMAGE 
IS MULTIPLIED A HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES ON BUDDHA'S BIRTHDAY 
IT'S A WAY FOR BELIEVERS TO EARN EVEN MORE MERITS 
BEFORE PASSING ON TO THEIR NEXT LIFE 
TSULTRIM'S WORKED HARD TO PREPARE FOR SAGA DAWA 
BUT HE'S DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TURNOUT 
STUDENTS AND ANYONE WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ATTEND RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS 
AND THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE POOR ATTENDANCE TODAY 
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SUBTLY CONTROLS AND MANAGES THE PEOPLE 
AFTER MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS OF CHINESE RULE 
TIBETANS ARE BETTER OFF 
BUT THEY STILL HAVE THE LOWEST LIFE EXPECTANCY 
AND THE LOWEST LEVELS OF EDUCATION OF ANYWHERE IN CHINA 
AND THERE IS CONTINUING RESENTMENT AGAINST THEIR CHINESE RULERS 
AS IN THE REST OF CHINA 
THE TIBETAN PEOPLE HAVE NO CHOICE OVER THEIR GOVERNMENT 
WHICH CONTROLS PRACTICALLY EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR LIVES 
YET DESPITE THIS THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO STOP MOST TIBETANS 
FROM FINDING A WAY TO LIVE 
ACCORDING TO THEIR DEEP SEATED TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS 
BUT THINGS ARE CHANGING FAST AND BEING A PART OF COMMUNIST CHINA 
MEANS TIBET CONTINUES TO LOSE ITS UNIQUE IDENTITY 
THINGS ARE ALSO CHANGING FOR TSEPHUN 
HE AND DONDRUP HAVE PARTED COMPANY 
BUT THE MONASTERY'S SO SHORT OF MONKS THEY'RE KEEPING TSEPHUN ON 
AND HAVE PLACED HIM WITH A NEW MASTER 
LOSANG LA 
IN MANY WAYS THE TENSION BETWEEN DONDRUP AND TSEPHUN 
REFLECTS THE CHANGES HAPPENING THROUGHOUT TIBET 
DONDRUP HAS NEVER BEEN PART OF THE MODERN WORLD 
AND HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ITS WAYS 
TSEPHUN IS THE NEW TIBET 
A TIBET WHICH IS RAPIDLY EMBRACING THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
NOW TSEPHUN AND DONDRUP ARE GOING THEIR SEPARATE WAYS 
AS IN THE REST OF TIBET 
THE GAP BETWEEN THEM CONTINUES TO WIDEN
