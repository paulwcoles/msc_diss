TONIGHT COUNTING THE COST AS THE MONEY 
KEEPS POURING INTO THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AQATICS 
CENTRE WE SPEAK TO THE MAN IN 
CHARGE PLUS THE AIR CRASH THAT 
MEANT THE ONLY HONOURS CROSS TO BE 
AWARDED IN PEACETIME 
PLUS WE'RE AT THE CHARITY GIG WITH 
A TOUCH OF MADNESS 
GOOD EVENING 
A BRIGHT YOUNG SIXTEEN YEAR OLD 
SCHOOLBOY CHASED THROUGH THE 
STREETS OF LONDON BY A GANG 
SCREAMING KILL HIM THE FINAL 
MOMENTS OF KODJO YENGA'S LIFE 
BEFORE HE WAS STABBED IN THE HEART 
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT THIS AFTERNOON 
FIVE TEENAGERS SOME AS YOUNG AS THIRTEEN 
AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK WERE 
FOUND GUILTY OF KILLING HIM 
TONIGHT IT'S EMERGED ONE OF THEM 
HAD BEEN GIVEN BAIL BY A COURT JUST 
HOURS BEFORE THE ATTACK 
OUR REPORTER IS AT THE OLD BAILEY 
FOR US NOW 
TODAY KODJO YENGA'S MOTHER 
DESCRIBED HER SON'S KILLERS AS 
COLD BLOODED CHILDREN HE WAS 
ATTACKED IN HAMMERSMITH AFTER BEING 
AMBUSHED BY MEMBERS OF A LOCAL GANG 
THEY HAD ARMED THEMSELVES WITH 
KNIVES BATS EVEN A PIT BULL DOG 
SOME EYE WITNESSES SAID THEY HEARD 
MEMBERS OF THAT GANG SHOUTING 
CATCH HIM KILL HIM AS THEY 
CHASED HIM DOWN THE STREET THEY 
CAUGHT UP WITH KODJO AND HE WAS 
STABBED OTHER EYE WITNESSES SAY 
THEY SAW SOME OF HIS KILLERS 
FLEEING THE SCENE LAUGHING LEAVING 
KODJO LYING ON THE GROUND WITH A 
STAB WOUND TO HIS HEART 
WE LOOK BACK AT THE EVENTS OF AT 
THAT DAY 
ACCORDING TO THOSE THAT KNEW HIM 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD KODJO YENGA WAS A LIGHT 
HEARTED AND GENTLE SOUL 
HE WAS A GREAT KID 
I KNOW IT'S CLICHEED BUT HE WAS 
VERY INTELLIGENT HE HAD A GREAT 
SENSE OF HUMOUR HE LOVED HIS MUSIC 
HE WAS ALWAYS WRITING HIS LYRICS 
AND SINGING HE ALWAYS HAD 
SOMETHING TO SAY HE WAS A 
CHARACTER CHARACTER YET THE LIFE OF A NOTTING HILL 
STUDENT CAME TO A VIOLENT END WHEN 
HE WAS ATTACKED BY A GROUP OF 
TEENAGERS ON THIS STREET IN 
HAMMERSMITH ONE OF THE TEENAGERS 
HAD CHALLENGED KODJO TO A FIGHT BUT 
A GANG OF TEN PEOPLE AMBUSHED HIM 
ARMED WITH KNIVES BATS AND A BULL 
TERRIER DOG HE HAVE COLLAPSED IN 
THE STREET AFTER BEING STABBED IN 
THE HEART WHERE HIS FIFTEEN YEAR OLD 
GIRLFRIEND FOUND HIM KODJO WAS 
POPULAR THAT PROVED WHEN HUNDREDS 
OF MOURNERS ATTENDED HIS FUNERAL 
HE WAS THE SEVENTH OF TWENTY SEVEN TEENAGERS 
TO DIE IN LONDON LAST YEAR THERE THERE WERE LOTS OF CHARACTERS IN THE 
SCHOOL AND HE WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF 
THEM HE WAS A GOOD KID AND WE MISS 
HIM A LOTTHERE 
WERE EMOTIONAL 
SCENES IN COURT TODAY AS TWO 
TEENAGERS WERE SENTENCED TO KODJO'S 
MURDER THE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD STARTED 
SHOUTING AND SWEARING WHEN THE 
VERDICT WAS READ OUT HE HAD TO BE 
DRAGGED FROM COURT THE MOTHER OF A 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD ALSO FOUND GUILTY OF 
MURDER SHE COLLAPSED WHEN SHE 
HEARD THE VERDICT AND ALSO HAD TO 
BE HELPED FROM THE COURTROOM IT 
WAS ALSO REVEALED OF THE THREE 
TEENAGERS WHO WERE FOUND GUILTY OF 
KODJO'S MANSLAUGHTER ONE SEVENTEEN YEAR 
OLD HAD ACTUALLY BEEN IN COURT JUST 
A FEW HOURS BEFORE KODJO'S DEATH 
THE POLICE HAD OBJECTED TO THAT 
TEENAGER BEING GIVEN BAIL BUT THAT 
WAS OVERRULED BY THE JUDGE HE WAS 
RELEASED AND HE WAS ROAMING THE 
STREETS WHEN KODJO WAS KILLED 
NOW ALL FIVE OF THOSE CONVICTED 
TODAY WILL BE SENTENCED NEXT MONTH 
WE ARE HOPING TO HEAR FROM KODJO 
YENGA'S MOTHER A BIT LATER IN THE 
PROGRAMME TO GET HER REACTION TO 
TODAY'S VERDICT 
THERE'S LOTS MORE TO COME 
INCLUDING INCLUDING IT'S CRUNCH TIME FOR CHELSEA AND 
ARSENAL IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
ARSENAL MUST OVERCOME LIVERPOOL 
WHILE CHELSEA MUST BEAT FEN BATCHY 
HERE AT STAMFORD BRIDGE 
OLYMPIC ORGANISERS HAVE ADMITTED 
TODAY THAT THE COST OF THE MOST 
AMBITIOUS TWO THOUSAND TWELVE VENUE HAS MORPBD 
TRIPLED THE AQUATIC CENTRE WILL 
NOW COST OVER TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION 
BUT TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BOSSES SAY THE OVERALL 
BUDGET FOR THE GAMES OF ZERO POINT THREE NINETY THREE 
BILLION WON'T CHANGE STINGRAY AT 
LOBSTER PRICES THIS AQUATIC CENTRE 
IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST ARTISTIC 
VENUE OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IT'S THE FIRST 
BUILDING SPECTATORS WILL SEE WHEN 
THEY ENTER THE OLYMPIC PARK A 
SWIMMING COMPLEX DESIGNED LIKE A 
STREAMLINED FISH BUT THERE'S A 
PROBLEM THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF 
MONEY BEING POURED INTO THIS 
SPECTACULAR SWIMMING POOL AT FIRST 
THE BUDGET WAS SET AT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION 
BUT IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE IT 
DOUBLED AND TODAY WE ARE TOLD THE 
COST WILL BE TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION 
THROW IN THE INTEGRAL BRIDGE BESIDE 
IT AND THE WHOLE COMPLEX WILL REACH 
THREE HUNDRED THREE MILLION SOME SAY THIS IS OVER 
THE TOP 
THAT IS FINANCIAL 
INCOMPETENCE BY THOSE WHO DREAMT UP 
THE ORIGINAL BILL THE MAYOR OF 
LONDON THE OLYMPICS MINISTER AND 
THE THEN CHANCELLOR NOW PRIME 
MINISTER WHO SIGNED IT OFF OF A 
GIGANTIC SCALE 
THIS IS WHERE THE 
CENTRE IS GOING AT THE BOTTOM OF 
THE PICTURE HERE JUST OVER THE 
RIVER FROM THE ROUND BOWL THE SITE 
OF THE OLYMPIC STADIUM 
ORGANISERS SAY THE NEW PRICE WON'T 
AFFECT THE OVERALL BUDGET OF NINE POINT THREE 
BILLION BILLION BUT THE MAN WHO USED TO BE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING ALL THESE 
FACILITIES SAYS WE'LL BE LUCKY TO 
GET IT ALL DONE FOR TWENTY BILLION 
ONE THING IS CERTAIN THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
OLYMPICS WILL REALLY HAVE A LOT TO 
DO WITH THE PRICE OF A FISH 
JOINING ME NOW IS THE MAN 
RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING ALL THE 
OLYMPIC VENUES ON TIME AND UP TO 
STANDARD JOHN ARMITT YOU MUST BE 
AS SHOCKED AS OTHER LONDONERS ABOUT 
THIS RISING COST 
I'M NOT SHOCKED 
LAST YEAR WE SAID THAT THE TOTAL 
COST OF THE AQUATIC CENTRE 
TOGETHER WITH ITS THE BRIDGE 
ADJACENT TO IT WOULD BE JUST OVER 
THREE HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S WHAT WE'VE 
ANNOUNCED TODAY WE'VE KEPT IT 
WITHIN THE BUDGET AND THE BUDGET WE 
HAVE FOR THE GAMES 
WITHIN THE NEW 
BUDGET BUT CERTAINLY A LOT MORE 
THAN THE INITIAL BUDGET WHERE IS 
THIS 
MONEY GOING TO COME FROM THE THE MONEY FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES LARGELY 
COMES FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND FROM 
LOTTERY THAT MONEY HAS BEEN SET 
ASIDE BY GOVERNMENT WITHIN THAT 
TOTAL BUDGET AND THIS FITS EXACTLY 
WITHIN THE BUDGET AS WE FORECAST IT 
LAST YEAR 
SO AS TAX PAYERS WE 
SHOULDN'T BE EXPECTING TO PAY ANY 
MORE DUE TO THIS RISING COST OF THE 
BUILDING WORK 
CORRECT IT'S WITHIN 
THE BUDGET IT WAS AGREED WITH 
PARLIAMENT LAST YEAR 
WITH FIGURES 
RISING OVER THE YEARS ARE YOU IN 
DANGER OF LOSING THE SUPPORT OF ANY 
MANY LONDONERS GENUINELY LOOKING 
FORWARD TO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BUT PERHAPS GETTING 
FED UP WITH THE ISSUES SURROUNDING 
THE BUILDING WORK 
AS YOU JUST 
EXPLAINED THERE'S A BUDGET OF NINE POINT THREE 
BILLION IN TOTAL FOR THE DELIVERY 
OF GAMES THAT BUDGET WE'VE BEEN 
WORKING WITHIN NOW FOR THE LAST 
YEAR I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT 
COME THE END OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE WILL 
HAVE DELIVERED THE GAMES WITHIN 
THAT BUDGET 
I WAS GOING TO SAY THE 
RISK OF PERHAPS THE BUDGET RISING 
OF MAYBE US HAVING THIS CHAT IN A 
YEAR OR TWO TIME SAYING IT'S 
DOUBLED AGAIN 
I THINK IT'S VERY 
LOW PEOPLE SAY DO I GUARANTEE IT 
I CAN'T GAERPB TEE ANYTHING BUT I 
THINK WE HAVE A FAIR BUDGET THAT WE 
DEVELOPED LAST YEAR AND WE'RE 
STICKING TO IT 
THERE'S MEASLES ALERT IN SOUTH 
EAST LONDON THIRTEEN PROBABLE CASES HAVE 
BEEN DETECTED AT ONE SCHOOL IN 
LEWISHAM WITH FEARS OF ANOTHER 
OUTBREAK AT A SECOND SCHOOL HEALTH 
OFFICIALS SAY THE DISEASE IS 
DEVELOPING RAPIDLY AS THE OUTTAKE 
OF THE M. M. R. JAB IN THE BOROUGH IS 
TOO LOW BUT SOME PARENTS ARE NOT 
CONFIDENT THE JAB IS THE BEST WAY 
TO PROTECT THEIR CHILD 
MUM HENRIETTA LIVES JUST STONE'S 
THROW FROM SCHOOL IN SYDENHAM 
WHERE CASES OF MEASLES HAVE BEEN 
REPORTED YET SHE STILL HASN'T 
TAKEN HER SEVENTEEN MONTH OLD SON STANLEY 
FOR THE M. M. R. VACCINATION IT DOESN'T 
MATTER HOW MANY TIMES HEALTH 
PROFESSIONALS TELL HER IT'S SAFE 
SHE JUST DOESN'T BUY IT MOTHERS MOTHERS HAVE TOLD ME THEIR PERSONAL 
EXPERIENCES AFTER THE M. M. R. JAB 
THESE PARENTS AND CHILDREN'S LIVES 
CHANGE FOREVER YEAH 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY 
CONFUSING CONFUSING IN THE BOROUGH OF LEWISHAM 
HENRIETTA IS NOT ALONE MUCH ONLY 
SIXTY FOUR PER CENT OF CHILDREN HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE 
M. M. R. VACCINATION THERE'S EVEN BEEN 
AN OUTBREAK OF MEASLES AT THE LOCAL 
HOSPITAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE 
CONCERNED IT'S SPREADING FAST ANY ANY CHILD WHO IS NOT PROTECTED AGAINST 
MEASLES IS LIKELY TO CATCH IT IT'S 
SUCH A SUCH AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE 
PUPILS HERE AT SYDENHAM SCHOOL WAS 
SENT HOME FOR THE EASTER HOLIDAYS 
WITH THIS LETTER CONFIRMING THERE 
HAD BEEN A MEESLE OUTBREAK AT THE 
SCHOOL AND WARNING PARENTS OF HOW 
SERIOUS THE DISEASE CAN BE 
ALTHOUGH THIS IS SECONDARY SCHOOL 
THE ADVICE IS THAT IT'S NEVER TOO 
LATE TO HAVE THE M. M. R. VACCINE 
THESE PUPILS IN THE SIXTH FORM AT 
THE SCHOOL HAVE FRIENDS WHO HAVE 
MEASLES MOST ARE UNSURE IF THEY'RE 
PROTECTED 
I DIDN'T FIND OUT THAT PROTECTED THE MEASLES COME BACK UNTIL 
RECENTLY I THINK MY MUM IS GOING 
TO TAKE ME TO THE DOCTORS AND CHECK 
I'VE DEFINITELY HAD THE JAB 
DEFINITELY NOT HAD THE JOB SO I'M 
NERVOUS 
MY FRIEND HAS THE MEASLES NERVOUS I'M NOT KEEN ON CATCHING IT EVEN EVEN THOUGH DROP IN M. M. R. CLINICS HAVE 
BEEN SET UP HENRIETTA IS STILL NOT 
CONVINCED SHE'S LOOKING INTO 
STANLEY HAVING SINGLE VACCINATIONS 
PRIVATELY IF SHE CAN RAISE THE 
MONEY THE THREE MAIN CANDIDATES IN 
THE MAYORAL RACE UNITED TODAY TO 
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REGISTER TO

FROM THEM WILL FURTHER 
DISENFRANCHISE SOME LONDONERS I I DON'T CARE WHO YOU VOTE FOR BUT 
GET OUT AND VOTE FOR A MAINSTREAM 
PARTY AND STOP THE B. N. P.'S MANTRA OF 
HATE 
THERE'S THE SIMPLE BRUTAL HATE FACT THAT A B. N. P. PLATFORM AT CITY 
HALL WILL COST LONDONERS JOBS THE THE ONE THING WE CAN DO ON MAY FIRST IS 
ALL COME OUT AND VOTE IN AS LARGE 
NUMBERS AS POSSIBLE TO DEMONSTRATE 
THAT THE CITY IS UNITED AND THAT WE 
REJECT THE POLITICS OF RACIAL 
DIVISION DIVISION THE CANDIDATE FOR THE LEFTIST PARTY 
LAUNCHED HER ELECTION MANIFESTO

FOR MAYOR AND SAYS SHE'LL PUSH FOR 
MORE LOW COST HOUSING AND STAND UP 
FOR THOSE ON LOWER INCOMES EVERY EVERY CANDIDATE WILL SAY THEY'RE GREEN 
EVERY CANDIDATE WILL SAY THEY CARE 
ABOUT THE THE ENVIRONMENT AND EVERY 
CANDIDATE WILL SAY THEY WITH AN 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT WHEN IT 
COMES TO CHALLENGING THE PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE THE WEALTH AND POWER I HAVE A 
TRACK RECORD OF HAVING DONE THAT 
ROUND THE ISSUE OF WAR I DO 
BELIEVE I CAN DO THAT OVER ISSUES 
LIKE HOUSING AND TRANSPORT AS WELL

THAT IS KODJO YENGE'S MOTHER 
SPEAKING TO OUR REPORTER GARETH 
FURBY FURBY FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF 
BRAVERY FORTY YEARS AGO TODAY A 
BURNING AIRLINER CRASH LANDLED AT 
HEATHROW SHORTLY AFTER TAKE OFF 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE PEOPLE ESCAPED BUT FIVE DIED 
INCLUDING YOUNG STEWART HE IS 
BARBARA JANE HARRISON STAYED ON 
BOARD TO STAY TRY TO SAVE 
PASSENGERS' LIVES THEY BECAME THE 
ONLY WOMAN IN PEACETIME TO BE 
AWARDED THE GEORGE CROSS FOR 
BRAVERY MATTHEW MORRIS HAS HER 
STORY STORY IN CEMETERY NEAR YORK LIES 
HEROINE OF HEATHROW AIRPORT 
BARBARA JANE HARRISON JANE TO HER 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS 
I THINK JANE 
WAS A ONE OFF CHARACTER SOMEHOW 
EVERYONE THAT MET HER WAS TOUCHED 
BY HER A GREAT PERSONALITY A GOOD 
LAUGH AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED HER 
SHORT LIFE 
JANE WAS A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD STEWART HE 
IS ON A BOAC BOEING SEVEN FORTY SEVEN EVENTUALLY 
BOUND FOR AUSTRALIA WITHIN SECONDS 
WHISKY ECHO AS THE PLANE WAS KNOWN 
HAD MAJOR PROBLEMS THE NUMBER TWO 
ENGINE FELL OFF THE DRAMA WAS SEEN 
FROM WINDSOR CASTLE 
PRINCE PHILIP 
WAS IN HIS OFFICE AND HE WAS 
GLANCING OUT OF OF THE WINDOW AND 
HE SAW WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS THE 
SETTING SUN ON THE WING OF THE 
AIRCRAFT AND SOON REALISED THAT IT 
WAS ACTUALLY ON FIRE 
WHISKY ECHO 
RETURNED TO HEATHROW FOR AN 
EMERGENCY LANDING 
AS WE STOPPED ON 
THE RUNWAY THIS SUPER HEATED METAL 
BURST INTO FLAMES THE FIRE THEN 
WORKED ITS WAY FORWARDS UP THE 
FUSELAGE AND EVERY NOW AND THEN 
THERE WOULD BE THE MOST HORRENDOUS 
EXPLOSION AS A FUEL TANK WOULD 
EXPLODE OR MAYBE A TYRE WOULD 
BURST 
THEY PUT THE CHUTES OUT THE BURST STEWARD WENT DOWN THE CHUTE TO PUT 
THE FIRE OUT AT THE BOTTOM BUT OF 
COURSE COULDN'T GET BACK JANE WAS 
AT THE BACK OF THE PLANE AND 
SHEPHERDING PEOPLE OUT PUSHING

MANY LIVES JANE WAS SEEN AT THE 
EXIT BUT DID NOT JUMP OUT SHE WENT 
BACK TO HELP THE REMAINING 
PASSENGERS SHE WAS LATER FOUND 
DEAD NEAR THE BODIES OF A DISABLED 
ELDERLY LADY AND A YOUNG GIRL 
THE FACT THAT SHE COULD HAVE GOT 
OUT AND CHOSE TO TRY AND HELP 
OTHERS I THINK HAS TO SHOW WHAT A 
HEROIC ACTION IT WAS 
SHE WAS A 
VERY BRAVE LADY SHE WAS RIGHTLY 
AWARDED A POSTHUMOUS GEORGE CROSS 
EVEN NOW JANE HARRISON IS THE ONLY 
WOMAN TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY AWARDED
