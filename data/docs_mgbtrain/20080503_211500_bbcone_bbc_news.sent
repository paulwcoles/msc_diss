MINISTERS PREPARE A LABOUR 
FIGHTBACK AFTER THE PARTY'S 
DISASTROUS PERFORMANCE IN THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS ELECTIONS THE TORIES ENJOY THE MOMENT AS 
BORIS JOHNSON TAKES OVER AS LONDON 
MAYOR MAYOR THE SOLDIER KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN 
TRIBUTES TONIGHT FROM PRINCE 
WILLIAM AND PRINCE HARRY PRAYING 
FOR MADELEINE THE MCCANNS ATTEND A 
SERVICE A YEAR TO THE DAY SINCE 
SHE DISAPPEARED IN PORTUGALTHE 
PENULTIMATE GAME IN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE NAIL BITER DID MANCHESTER 
UNITED DO ENOUGH 
GOOD EVENING MINISTERS ARE 
PREPARING A LABOUR FIGHTBACK 
TONIGHT AFTER THE PARTY'S 
DISASTROUS PERFORMANCE IN THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS THEY INSIST THEY CAN WIN 
A FOURTH TERM IN GOVERNMENT 
DESPITE MAJOR GAINS FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES TODAY THE NEW TORY 
MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON 
PLEDGED TO LEAD THE CAMPAIGN IN 
WHAT HE CALLED THE DREADFUL SCOURGE 
OF MINOR CRIME IN THE CAPITAL 
WE GO STRAIGHT TO DOWNING STREET 
CABINET MINISTERS ARE GETTING READY 
TO GO OUT THERE AND DEFEND THEIR 
BOSS TOMORROW'S NEWSPAPERS WILL BE 
PEPPERED OF ARTICLES OF SUPPORT 
FROM LABOUR'S 
BIG HITTERS BUT 
MANY 
IN THE 
PARTY ARE 
ONLY JUST 
BEGINNING 
TO COME 
TO 
TERMS WITH 
THEIR WORST DEFEAT AT COUNCIL 
ELECTIONS IN DECADES NONE MORE 
PAINFUL THAN THE CONSERVATIVES' 
CAPTURE OF LONDON'S CITY HALL 
I NOW FORMALLY PRESENT THE NEW 
MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON 
NOT THE MOST SURE FOOTED OF 
ENTRANCES BUT BORIS JOHNSON NOW 
HAS A JOB AS BRAND AS HIS 
NAME THE 
MAYOR ELECT STEPPED 
UP TO 
THE PLATE 
TODAY TAKING 
LONDON FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES AFTER EIGHT YEARS 
OFFICIALLY HE'S IN CONTROL FROM 
MIDNIGHT TOMORROW 
UNTIL THAT TIME 
I IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE SHREDDING 
MACHINES QUIETLY PUFFING AND 
PANTING AWAY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF 
THE BUILDING 
HE WON'T HAVE MUCH TIME FOR JOKES 
IN CHARGE OF HOUSING TRANSPORT AND 
POLICING THE CAPITAL 
I THINK THERE 
IS A VITAL NECESSITY TO DRIVE OUT 
SO CALLED MINOR CRIME AND DISORDER 
AS A WAY OF DRIVING OUT MORE 
SERIOUS CRIME L. DO THINK IT IS 
TIME THAT WE LED THE FIGHTBACK 
AGAINST THESE DREADFUL SCOURGES 
THAT IS REALLY THE TIP OF AN 
ICEBERG OF A PROBLEM THAT WE FACE 
ACROSS LONDON 
THE CHIEF OF 
THIS HASN'T BEEN COMFORTABLE COUPLE OF DAYS NOR SHOULD 
IT BE 
THAT IS WHAT THE BRITISH WERE 
SAYING TO 
US YOU 
NEED A KICK 
UP THE BACK SIDE WE 
ARE FEELING 
THE 
PINCH WE 
WANT TO 
KNOW 
WHAT YOU 
WILL 
DO TO 
SUPPORT US THROUGH TOUGH 
TIMES 
THE CONSERVATIVES 
HAVE TIMES TO 
CELEBRATE THEIR 
GAINS AS GOOD 
AS TONY BLAIR'S SHORTLY BEFORE HE 
TOOK 
DOWNING STREET 
NO DOUBT DAVID 
CAMERON HAS MOVED CLOSER TO POWER 
BUT WITH THAT WILL COME SCRUTINY 
LIKE NEVER BEFORE NOW WE 
HAVE TO 
REMEMBER THAT THESE 
RESULTS ARE 
FROM 
LOCAL ELECTIONS 
AND 
DON'T 
ALWAYS VOTE 
THE SAME WAY WHEN 
IT COMES TO GENERAL ELECTIONS YET 
PEOPLE I 
HAVE BEEN 
SPEAKING TO IN THE 
LABOUR PARTY 
ARE 
NONE THE LESS DEVASTATED BY THESE 
RESULTS SOME 
THINK THEY 
BECAUSE 
THE PARTY 
HAS MOVED TOO FAR 
TO THE RIGHT SOME QUITE THE 
OPPOSITE THINK 
THEY HAVEN'T 
FAR 
ENOUGH WHAT 
THERE DOES SEEM 
BE 
MUCH AGREEMENT 
ON 
IS THAT 
PART 
OF THE PROBLEM IS GORDON BROWN'S 
LEADERSHIP ITSELF AND LAURA HOW 
MUCH RECRIMINATION IS GOING ON 
INSIDE THE PARTY AND HOW MUCH 
DEBATE ABOUT 
THE WHOLE 
STRATEGY 
GET OUT OF 
THIS HOLE 
THERE 
THERE IS CERTAINLY A 
LOT OF 
DEBATE AND 
WHAT 
THESE RESULTS 
HAVE DONE 
IS TURN UP 
THE VOLUME OF CONVERSATIONS THE PARTY ABOUT THE PROBLEMS GORDON 
BROWN'S LEADERSHIP 
MEMBER OF THE 
GOVERNMENT SAID 
TO ME 
THAT HE 
HAS TO 
TAKE 
STEPS TO 
SHOW 
HE CAN 
CHANGE TO 
BEGIN TO 
HIMSELF TO 
THE PUBLIC 
YET AT 
SAME TIME 
THERE IS 
NO 
REAL HUNGER 
YET 
TO TRY 
TO PUSH HIM OUT OF 
NUMBER TEN NO REAL APPETITE FOR A 
LEADERSHIP CONTEST THAT COULD BE 
DAMAGING AND DEVISIVE THAT SAID 
GORDON BROWN MUST KNOW 
NOW THAT 
HAS TO 
SHOW HIS 
PARTY AND THE 
PUBLIC 
THAT HE 
CAN CHANGE 
TIME IS 
OF THE ESSENCE 
TOO HE'S 
DOING A 
ROUND OF INTERVIEWS TOMORROW 
TO TRY 
TO 
BEGIN THAT 
PROCESS BUT 
HE WILL 
FACE THE PUBLIC 
AGAIN AT 
A CRUCIAL 
BY ELECTION IN 
JUST A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS TIME
