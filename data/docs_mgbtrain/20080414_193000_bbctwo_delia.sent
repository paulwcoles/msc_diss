I'M GOING TO HAVE THE TREACLE SPONGE PUDDING THE LOW FAT ONE 
I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE THE TREACLE SPONGE PUDDING 
CAPPUCCINO CREME BRULEE 
IT'S LIKE A TREAT THING YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SPOIL MYSELF TONIGHT 
AND HAVE A LOVELY DESSERT AS IT SHOULD BE 
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE THAT'S SPECIAL AND IT HAS TO BE SPECIAL 
WE HAVE A GREAT PASTRY CHEF WHO PUTS A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT INTO MAKING DESSERTS 
AT HOME THOUGH WE'RE GOING TO TAKE SHORT CUTS AND MAKE SOME BRILLIANT DESSERTS IN MOMENTS 
THAT PUDDING WAS DELICIOUS 
OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF WRITING RECIPES I GET A LOT OF LETTERS FROM FRUSTRATED CHEESECAKE MAKERS 
BECAUSE THINGS GO WRONG SO I'M GOING TO SHOW THE FOOLPROOF CHEAT'S VERSION WHICH ANYBODY CAN DO 
THEY'RE CALLED NO COOK CHEESECAKES 
AND WE'RE GOING TO SERVE THEM WITH CARAMELISED RHUBARB 
BUT FIRST THE CHEESECAKE 
THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENT IF YOU LIKE ARE THESE LITTLE DISHES 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE INDIVIDUAL CHEESECAKES 
AND THEY'RE SEVENTY FIVE C. M. ACROSS AT THE BASE 
AND INSTEAD OF CRUSHING UP CRUMBS AND MIXING THEM WITH BUTTER AND BAKING THEM 
I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING QUITE CLEVER I THINK 
AND USE STEM GINGER BISCUITS AND THESE ARE QUITE SPECIAL 
IN FACT THEY'RE CALLED GINGER COOKIES 
AND YOU JUST TAKE A COOKIE AND YOU JUST DROP IT 
INTO THE BASE OF THE RAMEKIN AND IT DOES ACTUALLY FIT 
SO LET'S PUT ANOTHER ONE IN BECAUSE THE RECIPE SERVES FOUR 
FOR THE FILLING I'M USING CURD CHEESE 
CURD CHEESE IS NICE IN CHEESECAKE 
IT'S GOT A SLIGHTLY SOUR LACTIC FLAVOUR AND IT'S NICE AND LIGHT 
LIGHTER THAN FULL FAT CREAM CHEESE 
THIS YOU CAN GET AT DELIS 
AND I'VE GOT FOUR FIFTY G. HERE 
I BELIEVE THIS ONE ACTUALLY COMES FROM THE WEST COUNTRY 
AND THEN ALL IT'S GOING TO HAVE IN IT IS JUST A COUPLE OF INGREDIENTS 
FIRST A TABLESPOON OF GOLDEN CASTER SUGAR 
AND I USE A TABLESPOON 
HERE I'VE GOT FAIRTRADE VANILLA EXTRACT AND I'M GOING TO USE JUST A TEASPOON OF THAT 
AND THEN I JUST GO IN WITH A WOODEN SPOON AND MIX ALL THAT TOGETHER 
THE REASON THESE ARE CALLED NO COOK CHEESECAKES 
IS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE COOKED BUT INSTEAD THEY'LL GO INTO THE FREEZER 
ALL I'M GOING TO DO NOW IS TAKE SOME OF THE CHEESE MIXTURE 
AND JUST PUT IT INTO THE LITTLE RAMEKIN AND SPREAD IT OUT 
AND THEN COVER THAT WITH SOME CLINGFILM 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO GO INTO THE FREEZER FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
WHILE THEY'RE HAVING THEIR FREEZING SESSION I'LL PREPARE THE RHUBARB 
I SPRINKLE TWO ROUNDED TABLESPOONS OF DEMERARA SUGAR 
OVER SOME READY PREPARED FROZEN RHUBARB 
BUT YOU CAN USE FRESH WHEN IT'S IN SEASON 
COOK UNDER A PREHEATED GRILL FOR TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES TURNING JUST ONCE 
AND THE FINAL RESULT IS JUICY CARAMELISED RHUBARB 
SO WHEN YOU'RE READY TO SERVE THE CHEESECAKES AFTER ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
TAKE A SMALL PALETTE KNIFE AND JUST SLIDE IT ROUND LIKE THAT 
THEN THE IDEA IS YOU JUST TURN THE CHEESECAKE OUT ONTO YOUR HAND 
AND THEN BACK UP LIKE THAT ONTO THE PLATE 
THEN WE SPOON SOME OF THE RHUBARB OVER THE CHEESECAKE AND AROUND IT 
AND THE NICE THING ABOUT GRILLING RHUBARB 
IS IT STILL RETAINS ITS SHAPE AND BITE 
RHUBARB IS REALLY LOVELY WITH CHEESECAKE 
BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN SERVE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT 
YOU CAN HAVE RASPBERRIES RASPBERRY PUREE ANY KIND OF FRUIT YOU WANT AT ALL BLACKCURRANTS ARE NICE 
BUT IT'S JUST GOOD TO HAVE THOSE LITTLE NO COOK CHEESECAKES UP YOUR SLEEVE WITH NO WORRIES 
SO FAR OUR FOOTBALL SEASON HASN'T BEEN GOING TOO WELL 
WE'RE FIVE POINTS OFF THE BOTTOM AND I'M NOT AT ALL HAPPY 
BUT HOPEFULLY WE MAY HAVE FOUND THE SOLUTION 
I'M REALLY PLEASED TO MEET YOU AND WELCOME 
A WARM WELCOME TO NORWICH CITY FOOTBALL CLUB THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY 
WHICH IS IN IT'S BEGINNING TO BE AND WILL BE THE BEST FOOTBALL CLUB IN THE WORLD 
I MEAN WE'RE WORKING ON IT YOU KNOW 
I HAVE TO SAY THAT I LOOKED OUT THAT WINDOW A LITTLE BIT LATER THAN THIS YESTERDAY 
AND I THOUGHT IT'S NICE 
EVERYTHING'S NICE IT IS 
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE THE FOOTBALL TEAM 
A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE AND NASTY AND HORRIBLE 
EVERYTHING'S BEEN RIGHT SO FAR 
DEFINITELY I THINK YOU WILL FIND THE MAJORITY OF OUR SUPPORTERS 
ARE REALLY REALLY GOOD LOYAL SUPPORTERS 
AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T WIN A GAME IF THEY THINK THE TEAM ARE TRYING 
AND WE'VE PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT AND A GOOD PERFORMANCE THEY'RE GOOD AREN'T THEY YEAH 
I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY SAID TO THE PLAYERS 
IT SOUNDS A BIT STRANGE BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT I KNOW I'M RIGHT 
THEY SAY WINNING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IT'S NOT 
TRYING TO WIN IS 
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE TRYING TO WIN AND I MEAN REALLY TRYING 
NOT WHEN YOU THINK I'VE TRIED I'M SAYING GO THE EXTRA MILE 
YES THAT'S TRYING TO WIN 
IF YOU DO THAT I THINK YOU'LL WIN A LOT MORE THAN YOU LOSE 
YES 
WELL BRING 'EM ON 
I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO SUNDAY 
YES BYE O. K. 
THERE WE ARE VERY GOOD 
POSITIVE YES YES VERY GOOD 
WHEN YOU'VE GOT A NEW MANAGER IT'S ALWAYS WATCH THIS SPACE 
BUT WE'VE GOT REAL CONFIDENCE IN HIM I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THAT MAN 
IF YOU'RE ALL PULLING IN THE SAME DIRECTION I THINK THAT'S THE SECRET 
EVERYBODY'S WORKING TOGETHER AND EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO 
GET TO THE SAME PLACE REALLY 
WE LIVE IN HOPE 
WELL EVERYBODY LOVES CUSTARD TARTS 
AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A SPECIAL CUSTARD TART NOW 
THIS IS A PORTUGUESE CUSTARD TART 
AND I'M GOING TO START OFF BY MAKING THE CUSTARD IN MY BOWL 
I'M GOING TO USE A VERY ENGLISH INGREDIENT AND THIS IS A TABLESPOON 
OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED CUSTARD POWDER 
SO THAT'S GOING TO GO IN FIRST INTO THE BOWL 
THEN I'VE GOT A TABLESPOON OF UNREFINED CASTER SUGAR 
THAT GOES IN NEXT 
AND THEN I'VE GOT SOME MILK HERE WHICH GOES IN WITH THOSE TWO 
THEN I'VE GOT THREE EGG YOLKS HERE 
THEY'RE GOING TO GO IN NEXT 
SO WE'LL NOW GET A BIT MORE 
LIVELY WITH THE WHISK 
AND OVER IN MY SAUCEPAN BEHIND ME 
I'VE SOME HALF FAT CREME FRAICHE 
AND YOU PUT IT INTO A SAUCEPAN AND BRING IT UP TO SIMMERING POINT 
THEN YOU PUT THE HOT CREME FRAICHE IN TO JOIN THE OTHER INGREDIENTS 
AND LEAVE THE SAUCEPAN THERE COS WE'RE GOING TO USE IT AGAIN 
ONE MORE WHISK NOW TO WHISK THOSE TOGETHER 
AND THAT IS THE BASIC INGREDIENTS OF THE CUSTARD 
NOW WE NEED TO POUR THAT BACK INTO THE SAUCEPAN 
SO THAT WE CAN PUT IT BACK ONTO THE HEAT 
AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT UP TO SIMMERING POINT AGAIN 
AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT WORKING WITH CUSTARD POWDER IS THAT 
ONCE THE CUSTARD POWDER JOINS THE EGGS AND THE CREAM IT CAN NEVER CURDLE 
EVEN IF IT GOES TO LOOK LIKE SCRAMBLED EGGS IN FRONT OF YOU 
YOU CAN TAKE IT OFF THE HEAT 
PUT IT IN A BOWL AND IT'LL ALWAYS COME BACK SMOOTH 
SO THAT'S JUST COME UP TO SIMMERING POINT AND THICKENED NICELY NOW 
I'M GOING TO TURN IT OFF 
I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME REALLY NICE VANILLA FLAVOURING 
AND I'VE GOT VANILLA EXTRACT HERE ONE AND A HALF TEASPOONS 
SO THAT COMES OFF THE HEAT 
POUR IT INTO A BOWL AND LET IT GET QUITE COLD 
NOW WE GET TO THE EXCITING BIT 
THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT INGREDIENTS 
LITTLE THIN DISCS LIKE THIS OF READY ROLLED OUT PUFF PASTRY 
AND YOU JUST KEEP THEM IN THE FREEZER TAKE THEM OUT 
AND LET THEM DEFROST FOR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES 
WHAT YOU DO FIRST OF ALL 
IS BRUSH THE WHOLE OF THE SURFACE OF THE PASTRY DISC WITH BEATEN EGG 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DIVIDE THE MIXTURE 
IT MAKES FOUR THIS RECIPE 
WE'RE GOING TO DIVIDE THE MIXTURE ROUGHLY INTO FOUR OF THE CUSTARD 
AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUARTER OF IT OUT AND SPREAD IT OUT LIKE THIS 
NOW ALL YOU DO IS JUST ROLL IT UP LIKE THIS AROUND THE CUSTARD 
AND WHERE YOU'VE PUT THE EGG YOU CAN PINCH THE SIDES TOGETHER 
AND THEN JUST TAKE A PALETTE KNIFE AND PUT IT ONTO A BAKING SHEET 
NOW WE'RE JUST GONG TO BRUSH SOME MORE BEATEN EGG 
AROUND THE EDGE OF THE PASTRY 
SO THAT IS GETS A NICE GLAZE SO WHEN IT GOES INTO THE HOT OVEN 
IT WILL BE NICE AND GOLDEN AND SHINY 
I HOPE YOU'VE REALLY GRASPED THE SIMPLICITY OF THAT JUST HOW EASY IT IS 
NOW I'LL JUST SPRINKLE A LITTLE BIT OF CINNAMON 
OVER THE TOP 
JUST A PINCH 
THERE'S ABOUT HALF A TEASPOON IN THE WHOLE RECIPE 
THAT WILL GIVE LOVELY SPICINESS 
JUST A HINT NOT TOO MUCH 
AND THEN THAT IS NOW GOING TO GO INTO A HOT OVEN 
IT'S PREHEATED TO TWO HUNDRED DEGREES 
AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES TO COOK 
THIS CHINA HERE BELONGED TO MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER 
AND IT'S QUITE NICE TO HAVE SOMEWHERE TO PUT IT 
I HAD A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH HER UNTIL I WAS TWELVE 
SHE DIED WHEN I WAS TWELVE SO IT'S REALLY NICE TO SORT OF REMEMBER HER BY HAVING HER CHINA HERE 
WAS SHE A GOOD COOK 
YES SHE WAS A VERY GOOD COOK 
SHE ALWAYS USED TO MAKE A LITTLE LOAF THAT BIG AND PUT D. ON IT 
AND THAT WAS FOR ME 
I WAS BROUGHT UP ON GOOD FOOD 
GOOD FOOD IN MY FAMILY WAS THE PRIORITY 
NO WE DIDN'T HAVE HOLIDAYS ABROAD AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
BUT WE ALWAYS HAD REALLY GOOD FOOD 
NOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE OVEN AND THESE ACTUALLY DID TAKE TWENTY MINUTES 
IS THEY PUFF UP QUITE A LOT THE CUSTARD SORT OF PUFFS 
AND WHEN THEY COOL DOWN IT SINKS BACK DOWN BUT THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
SO JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT IN CASE YOU THINK OH SOMETHING'S HAPPENING THAT SHOULDN'T 
JUST TAKE THEM OFF THE BAKING SHEET 
AND PUT THEM ONTO A COOLING TRAY LIKE THAT 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM A TRADITIONAL GLAZE 
A CARAMEL GLAZE I'M GOING TO USE HERE 
BUT CARAMEL WHICH CAUSES US ALL SO MANY PROBLEMS 
WITH TOFFEE LADEN SAUCEPANS THAT HAVE TO BE SOAKED FOR HOURS IS ALL GONE NOW 
BECAUSE IF YOU WANT CARAMEL YOU CAN BUY IT IN A BOTTLE LIKE THIS 
AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST PAINT THE CARAMEL ON 
TO GIVE A LOVELY GLAZE 
AND MAKE IT ALL LOOK NICE AND SHINY 
WHEN THEY'VE COOLED 
THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO WHICH IS NOT REALLY MUCH OF A PROBLEM 
IS TO EAT THEM WHEN THEY'RE REALLY FRESH 
THESE HAVE TO BE EATEN FRESH 
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU MAKE A DAY IN ADVANCE 
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU MAKE AND YOU EAT WHEN THEY'VE COOLED ON THE SAME DAY 
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'LL HAVE ANY TROUBLE WITH PEOPLE EATING THEM 
ON THE SAME DAY AND I THINK YOU'LL ENJOY THEM 
THERE ARE ENDLESS WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN USE THESE LITTLE PASTRY ROUNDS 
SO THERE ARE LOTS OF VARIOUS VERSIONS OF MAGIC TARTS 
THESE ARE SAVOURY TARTS 
THAT ARE NICE TO SERVE FOR A LUNCH OR AS A STARTER 
THE FIRST ONE HERE IS PIEDMONT PEPPER 
AND IT'S GOT PEPPER IN THE BASE 
THEN TOMATOES ANCHOVIES CHOPPED GARLIC SLICED GARLIC AND BASIL 
THIS ONE IS A WHOLE GREAT BIG PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM 
AND THAT'S GOT LITTLE SLICES OF SPANISH CHORIZO ON THE TOP 
AND WHEN THAT BAKES THE OIL FROM THE CHORIZO GOES DOWN INTO THE GILLS OF THE MUSHROOM 
AND THAT HAS A WONDERFUL FLAVOUR 
AND THEN HERE WE'VE LINED THE PASTRY AT THE BOTTOM WITH PARMA HAM 
AND THEN PUT SOME CHOPPED FIGS ON THE TOP 
AND THEN SOME LITTLE CUBES OF GORGONZOLA CHEESE 
THEY WOULD MAKE LOVELY STARTERS LOVELY LIGHT LUNCH DISHES 
SO YOU CAN JUST MAKE UP ANYTHING YOU WANT TO PUT IN MAGIC TARTS 
YOU CAN HAVE ANY DIFFERENT FRUIT ANY DIFFERENT SAVOURY FILLING 
AND I KNOW YOU'LL HAVE LOTS OF FUN WITH THEM 
THIS IS THE CARMELITE MONASTERY IN QUIDENHAM NORFOLK 
THE CARMELITE SISTERS ARE A GROUP OF WOMEN 
WHO HAVE COME INTO AN ENCLOSED LIFE AND SPEND THEIR LIFE IN PRAYER 
AND MY FRIEND SISTER RACHEL IS HERE 
IT'S A COMPLETELY SPIRITUAL FRIENDSHIP AND A VERY SPECIAL ONE 
WHAT I ALWAYS THINK OF IN YOUR WRITING IN YOUR BOOKS 
THERE'S A KIND OF A RECURRING THEME RUNNING THROUGH 
WHAT IS IT MAN IS AN EMPTY SPACE THAT'S RIGHT 
THAT ONLY GOD CAN FILL THAT'S RIGHT 
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT OUR CARMELITE LIFE IS WE HAVE NO CLUTTER 
SO WE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE VERY STARKLY WHAT IT IS TO BE HUMAN 
THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT BEING OUR LIFE IT IS OUR PASSION 
WHAT I HAVE LEARNT FROM YOUR LIFE AND THE OTHER SISTERS 
THAT IF YOU CAN STEP BACK AND HAVE THIS KIND OF TIME OF SILENCE 
THEN THINGS DO TAKE ON A SHARPER FOCUS 
REALITY TAKES ON A SHARPER FOCUS DEFINITELY 
I'M MORE AWARE OF MY HUMAN FAILINGS 
BUT THEY DON'T WORRY ME I'M HAPPY 
I'M HAPPY IN BEING HUMAN 
I'M IMPATIENT I'VE GOT A MIND THAT GOES SO QUICKLY THAT I CAN BE VERY INATTENTIVE TO PEOPLE NOT LISTEN 
I GET TOO EMOTIONAL 
I GET WHAT MICHAEL CALLS SPEAKING BEFORE THE BRAIN'S ENGAGED 
OH I COULD RATTLE IT ALL OFF 
BUT EVERY HUMAN PERSON HAS A DIFFERENT GIFT 
THAT GIFT IS ALWAYS FOR OTHERS 
SO THEREFORE I THINK THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN A VERY HUMAN GOD 
BECAUSE HE BECAME A HUMAN PERSON 
IS INTEREST IN HELPING PEOPLE WITH THEIR COOKING 
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU AN ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL RECIPE 
IT HAS A FUNNY NAME KAISERSCHMARRN 
AND I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE 
BUT IT INVOLVES PANCAKES AND IT'S CHEAT'S PANCAKES 
WHICH ARE READY MADE READY COOKED AND THEY COME IN A PACK LIKE THIS 
THERE ARE SIX PANCAKES AND THE INGREDIENT TO GO WITH THE PANCAKES 
IS DRIED SOUR CHERRIES 
AND THEY COME IN A PACK AND THERE ARE ONE TEN G. HERE 
WHEN YOU BUY THEM THEY'RE NOT CALLED SOUR CHERRIES BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE 
THEY'RE MORELLO CHERRIES THAT ARE DRIED AND HAVE A LOVELY SHARP FLAVOUR 
NOW WHY THEY'RE IN THE SAUCEPAN IS BECAUSE I HEATED TWO TABLESPOONS OF DARK RUM 
THEN I PUT THE CHERRIES IN FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO 
SO THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO ABSORB THE RUM AND BECOME PLUMPER 
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH MY LITTLE STACK OF PANCAKES IS CUT THEM FIRST INTO STRIPS THIS WAY 
WITH A SHARP KNIFE AND THEN INTO STRIPS THE OTHER WAY 
AND THE REASON THEY HAVE THIS FUNNY NAME 
IS BECAUSE THE EMPEROR FRANZ JOSEPH IN AUSTRIA 
THE RECIPE IS AUSTRIAN THEY WERE REPUTED TO BE HIS FAVOURITE RECIPE 
SO WHAT YOU END UP WITH IS LITTLE SQUARES LIKE THIS 
AND IF THEY BREAK IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT ARE PIECES OF PANCAKE RATHER THAN WHOLE PANCAKES 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER TO THE HOB BECAUSE THEY'LL NOW GO INTO SOME MELTED BUTTER 
WE'LL TAKE THE CHERRIES AS WELL 
SO I'VE GOT SOME BUTTER THAT'S BEEN GENTLY MELTED HERE 
AND I'M NOW GOING TO TURN THE HEAT UP 
AND THERE'S ABOUT FIFTY G. IN THERE 
BETWEEN FOUR PEOPLE THE RECIPE SERVES FOUR IT'S NOT TOO BAD 
NOW WHEN IT STARTS TO FOAM LIKE THIS 
JUST ADD THE PANCAKES TO THE HOT BUTTER 
GIVE THE PAN A BIT OF A SHAKE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO ADD THE CHERRIES 
AND THE LITTLE BITS OF RUM THAT THEY WERE SOAKED IN 
AND THEN WE'VE GOT ANOTHER INGREDIENT HERE 
THIS IS TOASTED FLAKED ALMONDS 
AND THAT'S A LOVELY CHEAT INGREDIENT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY TOASTED 
AND WE'VE GOT ONE TEN G. HERE 
JUST TOSS ALL THAT AROUND 
SO THAT IT ALL GETS A GOOD COATING WITH THE BUTTERY RUM 
AND WHEN THEY'RE NICE AND HOT 
A COUPLE OF MINUTES 
TURN THE HEAT OUT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PUT ANOTHER INGREDIENT 
I'VE GOT TWO TABLESPOONS OF UNREFINED ICING SUGAR AND A TEASPOON OF CINNAMON 
SO THAT'S GOING TO GO ON TOP NOW 
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO WITH THIS RECIPE IS PREHEAT THE GRILL 
FOR AT LEAST TEN MINUTES THEN WHAT HAPPENS IT HEATS OUT UNDERNEATH 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS FINISH COOKING THEM UNDER THE GRILL 
THERE WE GO OVER TO THE GRILL 
NOW THEY WILL TAKE ANOTHER COUPLE OF MINUTES 
AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO WAIT UNTIL THE ICING SUGAR ON THE TOP BEGINS TO CARAMELISE 
I LOVE FOOD 
I HAVE A PASSIONATE LOVE OF FOOD I'M VERY GREEDY 
YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS THINKING WHERE'S THE NEXT MEAL COMING FROM 
BUT I ALSO HAVE ANOTHER PASSION AND THAT'S FOR COMMUNICATION 
I DON'T SEE MYSELF AS ACTUALLY BEING A GREAT COOK 
WHEN I FIRST WANTED TO LEARN TO COOK MYSELF 
I FOUND A LOT OF COMMUNICATION TO BE VERY INADEQUATE 
YOU KNOW THE INFORMATION WASN'T GIVEN IN THE RECIPE 
AND I THOUGHT WHAT DO YOU DO THERE 
WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO THEN 
AND SO THAT'S HOW I TRY TO DO IT LEAVING NO STONES UNTURNED 
THE MORE COOKING THERE IS ON TELEVISION THE MORE PEOPLE SEEING FOOD BEING PREPARED 
THE MORE THEY'RE LEARNING 
WHAT I THINK IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT IT MAKES COOKING LOOK LIKE 
IT'S THE EXCLUSIVE TERRITORY OF CHEFS AND IT ISN'T FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE 
AND I DON'T LIKE SEEING PEOPLE HUMILIATED ON TELEVISION BECAUSE THEY CAN'T COOK 
THE TEST OF A RECIPE FOR ME ON THE TELEVISION OR IN A BOOK 
IS HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL LEAP UP AND DO IT 
WHEN THEY DO THAT I'VE ACHIEVED WHAT I SET OUT TO ACHIEVE 
IT'S A DELICIOUS AROMA NOW OF TOASTED ALMONDS AND CHERRIES 
REALLY NICE 
SO YOU JUST SPOON IT ONTO SOME WARM SERVING PLATES 
ALL THAT'S GOING TO NEED NOW 
IS SOME CHILLED POURING CREAM 
AND THAT IS KAISERSCHMARRN 
WE'VE GOT A NIGHT MATCH TONIGHT THIS IS AGAINST HULL CITY 
VERY IN FORM TEAM DOING INCREDIBLY WELL 
WE'RE NOT DOING BADLY EITHER 
SINCE WE HIRED GLENN AS MANAGER THINGS ARE REALLY LOOKING UP 
WE WERE FIVE POINTS OFF THE BOTTOM AND NOW WE'RE FOUR POINTS OFF THE PLAY OFF POSITION 
SO WE HAVE JUST GONE BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP 
THE THING WITH FOOTBALL THOUGH IS YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY IT WILL BE QUITE A TOUGH ONE THIS ONE 
AND EVERYBODY SAYS THIS IN FOOTBALL SO I'LL SAY IT IT'S MASSIVE 
TOTALLY WOW 
RUSSELL 
EVANS 
IN TOWARDS DUBLIN THAT'S A DECENT ONE THAT'S THERE 
HAS CAMPBELL GOT THE PACE HE HAS 
STILL WITH CAMPBELL OH IT'S IN 
IT'S ONE APIECE 
ALL EQUAL HERE AT CARROW ROAD 
FINAL SCORE NORWICH ONE HULL CITY ONE 
A DRAW ISN'T A BAD RESULT 
HOWEVER FOOTBALL IS FULL OF TWISTS AND TURNS AND WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO 
WELL EVERYONE WHO LOVES CHOCOLATE LOVES CHOCOLATE MOUSSE 
BUT IT CAN BE A BIT FIDDLY IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT PROPERLY 
SO I'M DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU THE CHEAT'S VERSION 
IT'S CALLED CHOCOLATE RICOTTA MOUSSE 
AND I'M TRYING TO EMULATE SOMETHING I DID ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO 
WHICH WAS A CHOCOLATE RICOTTA CHEESECAKE 
AND SO THIS IS CHOCOLATE RICOTTA SORT OF MOUSSE 
WHAT I'VE GOT IN MY MY BOWL IS ONE HUNDRED G. OF REALLY DARK CHOCOLATE 
IT'S GOT TO BE SEVENTY OR SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT COCOA SOLIDS 
AND I'VE BEEN MELTING IT OVER JUST ABOUT AN INCH OF WATER 
YOU BREAK IT UP IN PIECES FIRST 
AND IT'LL TAKE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO BECOME NICE AND MELTED AND LIQUID 
WE'LL JUST LET THAT COOL A MINUTE 
AND DEAL WITH THE REST OF THE RECIPE 
AND WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS ANOTHER FIFTY G. OF DARK CHOCOLATE 
AND I'VE BROKEN THAT UP INTO PIECES AND I'M GOING TO CHOP IT 
THERE WE GO WE'LL JUST GIVE IT A FEW SHARP BURSTS 
THAT'S IT WHAT YOU WANT IS NOT TOO FINELY CHOPPED 
NOT TOO COARSELY CHOPPED BUT JUST LIKE THAT 
AND NOW I'LL JUST RESERVE IT IN A BOWL HERE 
AND WHAT I'M NOW GOING TO DO IS ADD THE RICOTTA CHEESE 
I'VE GOT A TWO FIFTY G. TUB HERE 
YOU PROBABLY THINK WHEN I GET ONTO THE OTHER INGREDIENTS 
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO GET IT ALL IN BUT I AM 
NOW TWO TABLESPOONS OF HALF FAT CREME FRAICHE FROM THE TUB 
AND WE'LL USE THE REST LATER 
THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME SOFT DARK BROWN SUGAR 
ABOUT TWO LEVEL TABLESPOONS 
SO THAT'LL ADD A BIT OF SWEETNESS 
AND NOW I'M GOING TO USE SOME RUM 
ONE TABLESPOON OF RUM 
WHICH ALWAYS GOES SO WELL WITH CHOCOLATE 
AND NOW THE LID GOES ON AND WE'LL JUST GIVE THAT A QUICK WHIZZ 
AND THEN JUST POUR IT IN TO JOIN THE CHOCOLATE 
AND THEN JUST FOLD THE TWO TOGETHER 
THE CHOPPED CHOCOLATE I DID EARLIER 
I'M JUST GOING TO PUT HALF OF THAT 
IN WITH THIS 
AND SAVE THE REST FOR LATER 
THE REASON I LIKE CHOCOLATE AND RICOTTA TOGETHER IS BECAUSE IT HAS A MILD CHOCOLATE FLAVOUR 
IT'S SPECIAL QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE SORT OF IN YOUR FACE EVERYTHING CHOCOLATE 
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THAT NOW IT'S GOING TO GO INTO FOUR SERVING GLASSES 
I'VE SOME QUITE PRETTY GLASSES BUT YOU CAN USE ANYTHING WINE GLASSES WHATEVER IT IS 
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A WINE GLASS 
AND THEN ALL YOU DO IS JUST DIVIDE IT INTO FOUR 
THIS RECIPE SERVES FOUR 
THEN WE'RE GOING TO TOP IT WITH THE REST OF THAT TUB OF CREME FRAICHE THAT YOU SAW 
LIKE THAT 
AND THEN TOP THAT WITH SOME OF THE CHOPPED CHOCOLATE 
THAT WE CHOPPED RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING 
JUST COVER IT LOOSELY WITH CLINGFILM BEFORE IT GOES INTO THE FRIDGE 
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY GOOD CHOCOLATE 
ALMOST CHOCOLATE MOUSSE 
WHILE I'VE BEEN WITH YOU I HOPE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHOW YOU 
THAT IF YOU'RE AFRAID TO COOK OR SHORT OF TIME 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLICATED 
WITH SOME QUALITY INGREDIENTS TUCKED AWAY IN YOUR STORE CUPBOARD AND FREEZER 
A GREAT MEAL WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS WILL ONLY EVER BE MOMENTS AWAY 
OOH 
SO HAS ALL THIS COOKING BEEN TOUGH DELIA 
THE JOY OF JOYS HAS BEEN BEING IN MY ABSOLUTE REAL OWN KITCHEN
