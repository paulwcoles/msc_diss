ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT A HAND

WHAT HAVE THE ANCIENT GREEKS GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING 
I'LL TELL YOU IN ANCIENT GREECE 
THEY WANTED EVERYTHING TO BE PERFECT SO THEY THOUGHT HARD 
THEY ORGANISED THEMSELVES THEY DID THINGS STEP BY STEP 
NOW WHAT IS THAT YOU'VE GOT OUT THERE EH 
CHAOS DISORDER THE ENEMY OF THE GREEKS 
LOOK THE PARTHENON 
THE FAMOUS TEMPLE IN ATHENS 
SIMPLE LINES BEAUTIFUL CLEAN SHAPE IT'S PERFECT 
NOW LOOK AT THAT BUILDING OVER THERE 
SPLENDID PILLARS JUST LIKE THE PARTHENON 
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED 
IF IN THE MIDDLE OF BUILDING THE BUILDER HAD SUDDENLY STOPPED 
JUST BECAUSE SOME GIRL CALLED HELEN CAME ALONG AND ANNOYED HIM 
I'LL TELL YOU THOSE PILLARS WOULD HAVE FALLEN RIGHT ON YOUR HEAD 
INSTEAD OF A SOCK NOW 
WHENEVER YOU'RE IN TROUBLE 
OPEN THE BOOK LOOK INSIDE 
YOU'LL FIND THE ANSWERS 
HOW WAS THE BOOK GOING TO HELP ME 
PAPOU OFTEN TOOK ME TO THE THEATRE TO SEE OLD GREEK MYTHS AND PLAYS 
ONE OF MY FAVOURITES WAS ABOUT A BOY CALLED ICARUS 
WHO WOULDN'T LISTEN TO HIS DAD 
SEE IF YOU CAN REMEMBER WHAT HIS DAD IS BUILDING 
STYLE IS THIS STYLISH OR WHAT 
I WISH I WERE IN ATHENS NOW 
WHY THIS IS THE BUSINESS 
FRUIT BEDS 
SERVANTS OUTSIDE WAITING TO FETCH US ANYTHING WE ASK FOR 
THE GUARDS YOU MEAN 
THEY'VE LOCKED US IN 
WHOAH 
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT VIEW 
STOP GRUMBLING 
MINOS IS PAYING YOU ENOUGH 
I LIKE IT HERE THIS IS THE BUSINESS 
BUT WHY ME IT'S NOT AS IF HE'S SHORT OF CRAFTSMEN 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST 
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ALWAYS TELLING ME WHAT'S THE PROBLEM 
MINOS WANTS THE GREAT DAEDALUS TO DESIGN HIS CELLARS 
AND HE'S WILLING TO PAY 
BUT WHAT'S IT FOR 
THIS CELLAR THIS MAZE THIS LABYRINTH I'M SUPPOSED TO BUILD 
WHY DOES HE NEED IT 
I MEAN WHY WOULD ONE WISH TO HAVE A MAZE OF PASSAGES 
SO COMPLICATED THAT ANYONE WHO GOES IN CAN NEVER FIND THEIR WAY OUT 
HE TOLD YOU IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS 
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT HE WANTS IT FOR JUST THAT HE DOES 
LOOK YOU'RE A GENIUS INVENTOR RIGHT 
STOP BELLYACHING 
I LIKE IT HERE 
THAT'S GOOD SON 
I'M GLAD 
AT LEAST WE HAVE EACH OTHER FOR COMPANY EH 
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS 
YOU HAVE DONE WELL DAEDALUS 
YOUR LABYRINTH ER MY LABYRINTH 
IS A MIRACLE OF COMPLEXITY 
I NOTICE YOU DO NOT ASK ME WHAT IT IS FOR 
I ADMIT I AM INTRIGUED 
NOW THAT IT IS FINISHED I CAN TELL YOU 
A ZOO 
A CAGE TO RETAIN THE MINOTAUR 
I SUPPOSE THIS MAZE HAS A SECRET 
THERE IS A SOLUTION TO THE LABYRINTH 
OF COURSE YOUR MAJESTY 
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE ONCE YOU'VE BEEN TOLD 
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TAKING 
I CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO LEAVE CRETE 
YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS THE SOLUTION TO THE LABYRINTH 
NOW EITHER I CAN KILL YOU 
OR YOU CAN STAY ON AS MY HONOURED GUESTS 
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE 
GOOD DAY DAEDALUS 
WHAT HAVE I DONE 
WHAT HAVE I DONE I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT 
WE CAN'T LEAVE SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL 
FOOD DRINK MONEY

DID YOU GET IT 
HIS DAD WAS BUILDING A MAZE OR LABYRINTH FOR THE MINOTAUR 
GRRR ANYWAY MY BUILDING WASN'T GETTING ANY BETTER 
BUT PAPOU KNEW JUST THE THING THAT WOULD HELP ME 
ARCHITECTURE 
THE PARTHENON MY BUILDING WASN'T QUITE THERE YET 
IT HAPPENED AGAIN I WAS DRESSED AS AN ANCIENT GREEK 
WHO ARE YOU 
WHO DO YOU THINK I AM WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WHY ARE YOU ANSWERING EVERY QUESTION WITH A QUESTION 
WHY DO YOU THINK I'M ANSWERING EVERY QUESTION WITH A QUESTION 
SOCRATES I KNOW YOU 
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO HANGS OUT TALKING ABOUT DEATH 
AND WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG 
A PHILOSOPHER YOU TRY AND TRICK PEOPLE BY ASKING THEM QUESTIONS 
WELL YOU CAN'T TRICK ME COS I'M FROM ATHENS TOO 
AND WHAT IS THIS STRUCTURE 
IT'S A HOUSE CAN YOU LIVE IN IT 
NO THEN IS IT A HOUSE 
NO IT'S A HOPELESS PILE OF NOTHING 
THE MOST CHAOTIC PILE OF JUNK IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE A HA 
YOU TRICKED ME I HELPED YOU FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER 
YES THIS IS INDEED A HOPELESS PILE OF JUNK 
IF YOU'RE FROM GREECE HOW CAN YOU CALL THIS A BUILDING 
WHAT'S THAT PIECE OF WOOD DUNNO 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT ISN'T A COLUMN 
IN ANCIENT GREECE YEAH YEAH I'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE 
EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT BUT DID YOU LISTEN 
IN ANCIENT GREECE WE HAD BEAUTIFUL COLUMNS TO HOLD UP OUR BUILDINGS 
THE DORIC FLAT AT THE TOP 
IONIC CURLED AT THE TOP 
CORINTHIAN ALL FANCY 
MASTERPIECES 
THE DORIC FLAT AT THE TOP 
THE IONIC CURLED AT THE TOP 
THE CORINTHIAN ALL FANCY 
COME ON NOW YOU DO IT 
DORIC 
IONIC CORINTHIAN 
DORIC IONIC CORINTHIAN 
DORIC IONIC CORINTHIAN 
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS THINK GREEK 
THEN THINGS WERE BACK TO NORMAL 
THINK GREEK 
I NEVER REALISED HOW MUCH MATHS YOU HAVE TO DO TO BUILD SOMETHING 
I GUESS MATHS IS USEFUL 
IT CERTAINLY WAS TO THE PHILOSOPHER ARCHIMEDES 
HE WAS A GENIUS MAD AS A BAG OF BADGERS BUT A GENIUS' 
HE THUNK THOUGHTS ABOUT MATHS ALL THE TIME 
AS I SAID MAD AS A BAG OF BADGERS 
AND FORGOT TO EAT AND TAKE A BATH IMAGINE 
DURING ONE OF THE ONLY TIMES HE DID TAKE A BATH 
HE SOLVED A PROBLEM HE'D BEEN WORKING ON FOR AGES 
HE WENT IN WATER WENT OUT 
BIG WOW 
HE WAS HAPPY TO SAY THE LEAST 
EUREKA EUREKA WOO HOO 
HEY GREASED LIGHTNING 
ARGH 
ARGH MY FOOT 
OH NO ARGH PAPOU PAPOU 
ALEX ALEX 
ALEX 
MEDICINE 
HELEN MY NAME IS FRANCO 
IT'S NO GOOD I'LL HAVE TO TAKE SOME BLOOD 
STOP WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO ME 
WE GREEKS BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU'RE ILL IT'S COS YOU WERE BAD 
AND YOU MUST BE PUNISHED FOR YOUR SINS I STOOD ON A NAIL 
YOU MUST ACCEPT YOUR PUNISHMENT 
LOOK GIVE ME A STITCH FIX ME UP AND LET ME GO 
YOUR FOOT'LL HAVE TO BE CHOPPED OFF AND OFFERED TO THE GODS WHAT 
STOP THAT 
I'VE BROUGHT HIPPOCRATES LET ME THROUGH 
GET OUT OF THE WAY HE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD 
RHONA WHAT WAS RHONA DOING DRESSED AS A MAN 
THIS IS HIPPOCRATES ONE OF THE FIRST DOCTORS 
THE FATHER OF MEDICINE 
HE'S BEEN BAD AND THE GODS ARE PUNISHING HIM NONSENSE 
MEDICINE IS A SCIENCE 
WHICH MEANS IT HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH RELIGION OR MAGIC 
THERE ARE CLEAR REASONS FOR BEING SICK 
REASONS WE CAN FIND OUT IF WE READ LOOK FEEL TASTE 
I BELIEVE MEDICINE IS ABOUT LEARNING ABOUT THE BODY 
ABOUT LEARNING FROM SICK PEOPLE HE'S A CLEVER BOY 
LET ME HAVE A TASTE 
OH YUCK SOME OF HIS METHODS ARE RATHER STRANGE 
JUST AS I THOUGHT IT'S INFECTED 
ALL I NEED IS A TETANUS INJECTION AND SOME ANTIBIOTICS 
I GUESS YOU HAVEN'T DISCOVERED THOSE YET 
GET SOME REST GO TO SLEEP 
SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP 
YOU KNOW TODAY WE TRUST DOCTORS 
TO GIVE US MEDICINE THAT WILL MAKE US FEEL BETTER 
BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS SO 
OUR WORD PHARMACY COMES FROM THE ANCIENT GREEK WORD PHARMACON 
WHICH MEANS MEDICINE OR POISON 
IN ANCIENT GREECE 
IT COULD BE EITHER DEPENDING ON WHO GAVE IT TO YOU 
TAKE THESE FIRST THING AFTER BREAKFAST 
AND IF IT KILLS YOU THEN COME BACK IN THREE WEEKS 
HOW'S THE INVALID AND THE INJURY 
DON'T LICK MY FOOT WHY WOULD I WANT TO LICK YOUR FOOT 
DON'T TELL ME 
IT'S THOSE GREEKS AGAIN 
IT'S PERFECT 
DORIC IONIC CORINTHIAN 
GOOD SONG POPPADOM 
ACTUALLY IT'S PAPADOPOULOS ALEX PAPADOPOULOS 
SO THAT'S HOW I LEARNED WHAT THE GREEKS THOUGHT ABOUT ARCHITECTURE 
PHILOSOPHY AND MEDICINE 
ALL THANKS TO PAPOU AND A STRANGE OLD BOOK
