WE DIDN'T NEED ANY FOOD AFTER ALL NO WE DIDN'T TAMBA 
BUT THERE MIGHT BE SOME REAL FOOD THROUGH ONE OF THE WINDOWS 
SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK COME ON 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE 
TWO 
THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S 
THE 
ROUND WINDOW 
BETHANY TASHA AND EMMA ARE HAVING A PICNIC 
DADDY PLEASE MAY I HAVE SOME JAMMY BISCUITS O. K. 
TO MAKE A JAMMY BISCUIT 
YOU FIRST NEED TO MIX ALL THE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER 
DARREN IS PUTTING IN SOME BAKING POWDER TO MAKE THE BISCUITS RISE 
NEXT HE PUTS IN THE FLOUR 
AND FINALLY A BUCKET FULL OF BISCUIT CRUMBS 
WHEN THE INGREDIENTS HAVE BEEN MIXED TOGETHER 
THE MIXTURE IS EMPTIED OUT 
READY TO BE SLICED INTO THIN SHEETS OF DOUGH 
THE DOUGH IS THEN CUT INTO BISCUIT SHAPES 
JAMMY BISCUITS ARE MADE OUT OF TWO PIECES 
A TOP AND A BOTTOM BISCUIT 
ONCE THEY'VE BEEN CUT INTO BISCUIT SHAPES 
THEY'RE READY TO BE BAKED IN THE OVEN 
THE OVEN IS REALLY LONG 
IT TAKES TEN MINUTES TO GET FROM ONE END OF THE OVEN TO THE OTHER 
SO WE'VE SPEEDED THE PICTURES UP A BIT 
WHEN THEY COME OUT OF THE OVEN THEY'RE BAKED AND READY TO EAT 
BUT A JAMMY BISCUIT WOULDN'T BE A JAMMY BISCUIT 
WITHOUT THE JAM 
THIS MACHINE SORTS THE BISCUITS INTO TOPS AND BOTTOMS 
BECAUSE THE JAM HAS TO GO ON THE BOTTOM BISCUIT 
WHAT A LOT OF BISCUITS 
WHEN THE BISCUITS HAVE BEEN PUT INTO ROWS 
THEY'RE READY FOR THE JAM 
THE JAM IS PUMPED THROUGH PIPES 
AND INTO A JAMMING MACHINE 
WHICH PUTS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF JAM INTO EVERY BISCUIT 
THIS MACHINE SUCKS UP THE TOP BISCUIT 
AND PLACES IT GENTLY ON TOP OF THE JAM 
AND THE JAM HELPS TO STICK THE TWO BISCUITS TOGETHER 
AND MAKE A JAMMY BISCUIT 
NOW THEY'RE READY TO BE PACKED INTO BOXES 
THE BOXES ARE COVERED IN A WRAPPER TO KEEP THEM FRESH 
THERE A PACKET OF JAMMY BISCUITS 
ALL READY TO BE EATEN ON A PICNIC 
THERE YOU GO 
M. M. M. JAMMY BISCUITS 
THESE BISCUITS LOOK DELICIOUS DON'T THEY 
ACTUALLY THEY REMIND ME OF SOMETHING ELSE UM 
IF I PUT THESE BISCUITS THERE 
WHAT ELSE DOES IT LOOK LIKE 
UM 
AH 
WHAT IF I ADD SOME BISCUITS 
DOWN THERE 
AND PUT SOME WAFER BISCUITS ON EACH SIDE 
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE 
I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE A FLOWER DO YOU 
SHALL WE MAKE ANOTHER FLOWER 
I HAVE GOT A PENCIL HERE 
WE COULD MAKE A PENCIL FLOWER LET'S GET OUR PENCIL 
WE'VE GOT SOME STICKY DOTS HERE 
THEY'RE IN THE SHAPE OF A CIRCLE ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE A CRINKLY EDGE 
IF I PUT ONE FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOWER THERE 
I CAN PUT SOME PETALS ALL AROUND IT 
THAT'S ONE PETAL 
THAT'S TWO PETALS 
AND NOW THREE 
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO USE JUST STICKY CIRCLES 
IF YOU WERE MAKING A PENCIL FLOWER YOU COULD USE ALL SORTS OF THINGS 
SQUARES OR TRIANGLES 
AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A CRINKLY EDGE EITHER 
THEY GO AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOWER 
LIKE THAT 
WILL YOU COUNT THE PETALS WITH ME 
WILL YOU ALL RIGHT 
ONE 
TWO 
THREE 
FOUR 
FIVE 
SIX PETALS 
THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING THOUGH 
MOST FLOWERS HAVE A COLOURED INNER 
WE'VE GOT SOME OTHER STICKY DOTS 
WE'LL PUT A COLOURED ONE INSIDE THE FLOWER 
YELLOW LOOKS NICE IT'S MY FAVOURITE COLOUR 
WE'LL PUT A YELLOW DOT SLAP BANG IN THE MIDDLE THERE 
LIFT IT UP 
AND THERE IS 
A PENCIL FLOWER 
YOU KNOW I THINK I'M GOING TO GIVE THIS FLOWER TO LORNA 
LORNA 
HI SIMON 
I'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU 
OH 
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU 
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD MAKE ONE FOR TAMBA 
OH YES I'VE GOT MORE STICKY DOTS HERE ACTUALLY 
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA 
WHY DON'T WE USE THIS 
THE BISCUITS 
NO 
PAPER PLATES 
GOOD IDEA WE'VE GOT LOADS MORE PAPER PLATES UNDER HERE RIGHT 
IF WE USE OUR LITTLE FLOWER 
WE CAN LOOK AT IT TO MAKE OUR BIG FLOWER 
PASS ME SOME OF THOSE PAPER PLATES IF I TURN ONE OF THEM OVER 
AND USE THAT AS THE CENTRE OF OUR FLOWER 
AND USE THE COLOURED SIDE FOR OUR PETALS 
ONE 
TWO 
THREE 
FOUR 
FIVE 
SIX 
LORNA THAT'S FANTASTIC 
SHALL I MAKE ONE IN ORANGE UH HUH 
SO YOU PUT ONE OVER LIKE THAT YES AND HOW MANY PETALS 
SIX PETALS 
ONE 
TWO 
THREE 
FOUR 
FIVE 
SIX 
THAT'S GREAT 
WE NEED A STEM FOR OUR FLOWER JUST LIKE YOURS 
YOU USED A PENCIL OH RIGHT 
IF I USE MY GREEN PLATES 
FOR THE STEM 
OH GOOD IDEA 
I'LL MAKE A STEM AS WELL 
PERHAPS THEY CAN JOIN TOGETHER 
LIKE THAT 
OH LOVELY 
BUT WHAT'S MISSING 
I KNOW 
STEMS SOMETIMES HAVE LEAVES COMING OFF THEM 
WE'LL TAKE A PAPER PLATE 
AND TEAR IT IN HALF 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA ONE LEAF THERE 
AND TEAR THE OTHER ONE 
IN HALF 
AND I'LL PUT ONE LEAF THERE 
AND THE OTHER LEAF THERE I'LL PUT ONE HERE 
YES 
I THINK 
OUR FLOWER NEEDS 
A FLOWER POT 
WELL WE'VE GOT SOME DIFFERENT PAPER PLATES HERE 
IF I START IN THE MIDDLE 
THEN WE CAN START WORKING OUR WAY DOWN 
O. K. THAT'S 
FIVE WE NEED FOUR 
O. K. 
OH I SEE THAT'S A FLOWER POT SHAPE 
THREE 
AND THEN TWO 
AT THE BOTTOM NOW 
THERE'S OUR FLOWER IN THE FLOWER POT 
THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD 
I THINK TAMBA WILL REALLY LIKE THESE FLOWERS 
WHERE IS TAMBA 
I DON'T KNOW TAMBA 
TAMBA 
LORNA SIMON I'M UP HERE 
WOW WHAT BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS 
WE MADE THEM FOR YOU 
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE FROM UP THERE 
THEY LOOK GREAT COME AND LOOK 
I WILL 
IT'S REALLY HIGH UP HERE 
SO I CAN LOOK DOWN ON THE FLOWERS 
SIMON DO YOU KNOW ANY PLANTS THAT GROW AS HIGH AS ME 
WELL SOME FLOWERS GROW AS HIGH AS YOU TAMBA 
AND LOTS OF TREES GROW THAT HIGH TOO 
BUT IF I WAS A WIGGLY WORM 
I WOULD LOOK UP AT ALL THE FLOWERS AND ALL THE TREES 
AND IF I WERE A BIRD 
I WOULD LOOK DOWN ON THE TREES AND THE FLOWERS 
THAT'S THE CLOCK 
I WONDER IF TODAY'S STORY 
WILL BE ABOUT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS UP 
OR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS DOWN 
TIKKABILLA TOCKABILLA 
TIKKABILLA TOCK 
WHAT'S THE TIME ON THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
WELL THE LONG HAND IS POINTING TOWARDS THE NUMBER THREE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS 
THAT MEANS IT'S QUARTER PAST SOMETHING 
AND THE SHORT HAND IS POINTING JUST PAST THE NUMBER FIVE 
SO THE CLOCK SAYS IT'S QUARTER PAST FIVE 
BUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CLOCK 
A GIRAFFE 
TODAY'S STORY IS CALLED GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE 
GERALD WAS A TALL GIRAFFE 
WHOSE NECK WAS LONG AND SLIM 
BUT HIS KNEES WERE AWFULLY BANDY 
AND HIS LEGS WERE RATHER THIN 
HE WAS VERY GOOD AT STANDING STILL 
AND MUNCHING SHOOTS OFF TREES 
BUT WHEN HE TRIED TO RUN AROUND HE BUCKLED AT THE KNEES 
NOW EVERY YEAR IN AFRICA THEY HOLD THE JUNGLE DANCE 
WHERE EVERY SINGLE ANIMAL TURNS UP TO SKIP AND PRANCE 
AND THIS YEAR WHEN THE DAY ARRIVED 
POOR GERALD FELT SO SAD 
BECAUSE WHEN IT CAME TO DANCING 
HE WAS REALLY VERY BAD 
THE WARTHOGS STARTED WALTZING 
AND THE RHINOS ROCKED AND ROLLED 
THE LIONS DANCED A TANGO WHICH WAS ELEGANT AND BOLD 
THE CHIMPS ALL DID A CHA CHA WITH A VERY LATIN FEEL 
AND EIGHT BABOONS THEN TEAMED UP FOR A SPLENDID SCOTTISH REEL 
GERALD SWALLOWED BRAVELY AS HE WALKED TOWARDS THE FLOOR 
BUT THE LIONS SAW HIM COMING AND THEY SOON BEGAN TO ROAR 
HEY LOOK AT CLUMSY GERALD THE ANIMALS ALL LAUGHED 
GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE YOU SILLY FOOL OH GERALD DON'T BE DAFT 
GERALD SIMPLY FROZE UP HE WAS ROOTED TO THE SPOT 
THEY'RE RIGHT HE THOUGHT I'M USELESS 
OH I FEEL LIKE SUCH A CLOT 
SO HE CREPT OFF FROM THE DANCE FLOOR AND HE STARTED WALKING HOME 
HE'D NEVER FELT SO SAD BEFORE 
SO SAD AND ALL ALONE 
THEN HE FOUND A LITTLE CLEARING AND HE LOOKED UP AT THE SKY 
THE MOON CAN BE SO BEAUTIFUL HE WHISPERED WITH A SIGH 
EXCUSE ME COUGHED A CRICKET WHO'D SEEN GERALD EARLIER ON 
BUT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE DIFFERENT YOU JUST NEED A DIFFERENT SONG 
LISTEN TO THE SWAYING GRASS AND LISTEN TO THE TREES 
TO ME THE SWEETEST MUSIC IS THOSE BRANCHES IN THE BREEZE 
SO IMAGINE THAT THE LOVELY MOON IS PLAYING JUST FOR YOU 
EVERYTHING MAKES MUSIC IF YOU REALLY WANT IT TO 
WITH THAT THE CRICKET SMILED AND PICKED UP HIS VIOLIN 
THEN GERALD FELT HIS BODY DO THE MOST AMAZING THING 
HIS HOOVES HAD STARTED SHUFFLING MAKING CIRCLES ON THE GROUND 
HIS NECK WAS GENTLY SWAYING AND HIS TAIL WAS SWISHING ROUND 
HE THREW HIS ARMS OUT SIDEWAYS AND HE SWUNG THEM EVERYWHERE 
THEN HE DID A BACKWARDS SOMERSAULT 
AND LEAPT UP IN THE AIR 
GERALD FELT SO WONDERFUL HIS MOUTH WAS OPEN WIDE 
I AM DANCING 
YES I AM DANCING 
I A. M. DANCING GERALD CRIED 
THEN ONE BY ONE EACH ANIMAL WHO'D BEEN THERE AT THE DANCE 
ARRIVED WHILE GERALD BOOGIED ON AND WATCHED HIM QUITE ENTRANCED 
THEY SHOUTED IT'S A MIRACLE WE MUST BE IN A DREAM 
GERALD'S THE BEST DANCER THAT WE'VE EVER EVER SEEN 
HOW IS IT YOU CAN DANCE LIKE THAT PLEASE GERALD TELL US HOW 
BUT GERALD SIMPLY TWIZZLED ROUND 
AND FINISHED WITH A BOW 
THEN HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED UP AT THE MOON AND STARS ABOVE 
WE ALL CAN DANCE HE SAID 
WHEN WE FIND MUSIC THAT WE LOVE 
SO GERALD COULD DANCE LIKE ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS YES HE COULD 
MAYBE WE'LL SEE SOME MORE ANIMALS 
THROUGH THE WINDOWS 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE 
SQUARE WINDOW 
ANIMALS USE THEIR TAILS TO DO LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS 
THESE ANIMALS ARE CALLED SEAHORSES 
AND THEY ARE A TYPE OF FISH 
THEIR HEADS LOOK A BIT LIKE A HORSE'S HEAD 
AND THEY LIVE IN THE SEA SO THAT'S WHY THEY ARE CALLED SEAHORSES 
SEAHORSES USE THEIR TAIL TO GRAB ON TO SEAWEED 
SO THAT THEY DON'T GET WASHED AWAY BY A BIG WAVE 
SEAHORSES USE THEIR TAILS TO HOLD ON TO THINGS 
THESE SPIDER MONKEYS USE THEIR TAILS TO HANG TO THINGS WITH AS WELL 
THEY LIVE UP IN THE TREES 
SO TO HELP THEM CLIMB THEY CAN GRIP ON TO THE BRANCHES 
WITH THEIR TAILS 
SPIDER MONKEYS USE THEIR TAILS LIKE ANOTHER HAND TO CLIMB WITH 
JUST LOOK AT THIS LONG SCALY TAIL 
CAN YOU GUESS WHAT ANIMAL THIS IS 
IT'S A CROCODILE 
CROCODILES HAVE LONG FLAT TAILS 
WHICH THEY PADDLE FROM SIDE TO SIDE TO SWING ALONG 
CROCODILES USE THEIR TAILS TO SWIM WITH 
THIS ANIMAL PREFERS TO COME OUT AT NIGHT 
AND IT HAS A VERY STRANGE TAIL 
THIS IS A SCORPION AND IT HAS A POINTY STING ON THE END OF ITS TAIL 
SCORPIONS HAVE A STING ON THE END OF THEIR TAIL 
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES WITH 
BUT THIS BIRD HAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TAIL OF ALL 
THIS IS A PEACOCK AND HE HAS THE MOST AMAZING TAIL FEATHERS 
WHEN IT FANS ALL OF ITS TAIL FEATHERS OUT LIKE THIS 
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COLOURFUL BIRDS OF ALL 
PEACOCKS USE THEIR TAILS TO SHOW OFF WITH 
SEAHORSES USE THEIR TAILS 
TO HOLD ON TO SEAWEED 
SPIDER MONKEYS USE THEIR TAILS TO CLIMB WITH 
CROCODILES USE THEIR TAILS TO SWIM WITH 
SCORPIONS USE THE STING ON THEIR TAILS 
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES 
AND THIS PEACOCK 
USES ITS PRETTY TAIL FEATHERS TO SHOW OFF TO EVERYONE
