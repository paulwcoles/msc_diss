FAVOURITE ALI CARTER HAS 
CONFOUNDED EXPECTATIONS BY GETTING 
HERE DENNIS TAYLOR AND CLIVE 
EVERTON ARE STEPPED IN AND I TRUST 
YOU ARE ALL READY TO GO 
INDEED WE ARE GOOD AFTERNOON 
EVERYONE WELL THIS BE BUTT MACRO 
WILL O'SULLIVAN REPRODUCE THE FORM 
THAT STEPHEN HENDRY DESCRIBED AS AS 
CLOSE TO PERFECTION AS YOU CAN GET 
CUE OR WILL CARTER WHO HAS 
EXPENDED AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF 
ENERGY HAVE ENOUGH LEFT TO PRESENT 
A SERIOUS CHALLENGE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN TO BREAK OFF 
IT IS PRETTY WARM TODAY AROUND THE 
CRUCIBLE THEATRE IN SHEFFIELD IT 
IS GOING TO GET PRETTY HOT INSIDE 
THE CRUCIBLE 
O'SULLIVAN WILL NOT WANT TO LEAVE 
CARTER SHOT AT THE RED TO THE LEFT HAND CORNER 
STEPHEN HENDRY COMPLEMENTED RONNIE 
A SOLEMN ON HIS SAFETY PLAY HE 
SAID IT WAS SOME OF THE BEST HE 
EVER SEEN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
THERE IS AN INDICATION THE WHITE 
ALMOST TIGHT ON THE BAULK CUSHION 
AT FIVE PER CENT OF ALL SULLIVAN'S SAFETY 
CARTER HAS CONFOUNDED EVERYBODY 
THIS WEEK WITH NOT ONLY HOW WELL HE 
HAS PLAYED BUT HOW WELL HE HAS 
SUSTAINED HIS FOUR HIS FORM 
THIS IS BIT OF CHANCE THE LONG 
POT SUCCESS RATE FEATURES CARTER AT 
SIXTY SEVEN AND RONNIE AT FIFTY SEVEN 
WHEN O'SULLIVAN ATTEMPTED THAT LONG 
RED HE HAD A LUCKY KISS IT LOOKS 
AS THOUGH THE IS GOING TO LEAVE THE 
RED OVER THE RIGHT CORNER 
FIRST TIME IT HAS EVER BEEN DONE A 
PIECE OF HISTORY TWO PLAYERS 
HITTING ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
WHO IS GOING TO POT THE FIRST BALL 
IN THIS YEAR'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
FINAL CUE THE ATMOSPHERE IS 
ABSURD AND THE ELECTRIC IS 
ABSOLUTELY AND IT'S ELECTRIC THAT IS THE BEST SAFETY SHOT SO FAR 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF REDS HE CAN 
GET DOWN OFF BUT THERE ARE LOT HE 
CAN CANNON INTO THAT SHOWS YOU 
WHAT RONNIE IS LOOKING AT IF YOU 
FLICK OFF ONE OF THOSE YOU HAVE THE 
ONE ON THE LEFT THAT YOU CAN CATCH 
HE CUT THE DOUBLE KISS HE CAUGHT 
THE DOUBLE KISS THERE WAS ONE 
POSSIBLE RED INTO THE LEFT CORNER 
THAT WAS TOUGH SHOT PLAYED WITH LOT OF SIDE 
HE CAN TAKE THIS RED IN THE LEFT 
CORNER AND THERE IS A POSSIBILITY 
HE CAN GET ON THE BLACK 
HE NEEDS TO GET THE WHITE SOMEWHERE 
NEAR THE OTHER WHITE IT DEPENDS ON 
HIS ANGLE VERY GOOD 
CARTER SAID LAST NIGHT THAT ALL 
WAS WORRIED ABOUT WAS HIS OWN GAME 
NOBODY ELSE'S 
HE HAS GOT TO Y. TO PLAY THE BALLS 
AND NOT HIS OPPONENT BUT IT MIGHT 
NOT BE THAT EASY IF O'SULLIVAN 
IMPOSES HIMSELF 
HE COULD NOT GET A BETTER CHANCE 
THAT LONG RED HE KNOCKED IN HE 
PLAYED IT PERFECTLY 
THERE HER INDEED 
THESE REDS THEY 
ARE 
INDEED THESE REDS THEY ARE SITTING VERY NICELY INDEED THREE 
REDS THREE BLACKS AM NOT EVEN 
GOING TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT REDS 
AND BLACKS 
IT WOULD BE A BIT MUCH 
IN THE FIRST FRAME OF A WORLD FINAL 
WHAT A CATASTROPHE THAT WAS MAYBE 
GRIPPED THE CUE A LITTLE UPTIGHT 
LEE THAT CAUSED THE JOB MICHAEL 
KIGHTLEY KIGHTLEY SO UNUSUAL TO SEE THAT HE WAS 
HAVING TO MAYBE LITTLE BIT OF 
TENSION CRYPTIC SLIGHTLY TIGHTER 
THAN HE NORMALLY WOULD GRIP IT 
SLIGHTLY TIGHTER 
YOU SOMETIMES GET 
AT SCOOPING EFFECT IF YOU GO BIT 
TOO TIGHTLY GREAT CHANCE FOR 
CARTER WHICH YIELDED ONLY TWENTY FOUR HE HE WILL BE A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
TIP BUT I THINK HE SHOULD BE O. K. HE 
HE DID HAVE A QUICK LOOK HE IS NOT 
CONCERNED IT IS JUST AN AWKWARD ANGLE 
HE TRIED TO MAKE A BIT OF AN ANGLE 
SO HE COULD GET OUT ON THE BLUE 
BUT YOU HAVE TO POT THE OBJECT BALL 
THAT IS THE MAIN PART OF THE SHOT 
IT WAS NOT A GOOD CONTACT 
CARTER CAN HARDLY BELIEVE HE IS 
BACK OF THE TABLE SO QUICKLY 
IF HE CANNONS THE LITTLE TRIANGLE 
IT WOULD LEAD HIM ON AT LEAST THREE 
REDS IT WOULD HELP TO STOP THE 
WHITE L. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF 
IT DOES NOT CANNON THE LITTLE 
TRIANGLE OF REDS 
THE TRICK IS TO PLAY THE POSITION 
OF THE BALLS AS IF IT WAS JUST AN 
ORDINARY MATCH INSTEAD OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT MATCH OF HIS LIFE 
ALI DID NOT GET TO SLEEP TILL AFTER 
THREE A M. THIS MORNING THAT WILL NOT 
AFFECT HIM THE ADRENALIN KEEPS YOU 
GOING OUT THERE 
ALTHOUGH HE DID 
ADMIT IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE LAST 
NIGHT HE HAD AMPLE PHYSICAL ENERGY 
HE WAS TIRED MENTALLY BUT HE SEEMS 
FRESH ENOUGH AT THE MOMENT 
THIS WAS HIS MISTAKE I GHASTLY 
MISCUE BUT O'SULLIVAN MISSED HIS 
FIRST RED TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH 
WITH IT POSITIONALLY 
HE HAS GONE SLIGHTLY ASTRAY HE CAN 
STILL HIT THE RED INTO THE MIDDLE 
POCKET 
JUST THE START ALI CARTER WAS 
LOOKING FOR THEY KNOW EACH OTHER'S 
GAME SO WELL THEY PRACTISE ON 
NUMEROUS OCCASIONS TOGETHER 
HAD THE RED STOP DOUBT IT WAS A 
HEAVY ODDS ON THAT CARTER WAS GOING 
TO GO ON TO CLINCH THE FRAME 
STOP OUT 
THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE THERE 
IS ONLY ONE AWKWARD RED 
IT IS HARD ENOUGH TO WIN FRAMES 
AGAINST O'SULLIVAN ARE THE BEST OF 
TIMES BUT CARTER HAS HAD TWO 
CHANCES ONE CAME TO AN END THROUGH 
HIS OWN FAULT THE SECOND THROUGH 
BAD LUCK IT COULD BE A 
PSYCHOLOGICAL SETBACK 
A DIFFICULT RED YOU USUALLY PLAY 
TO MOVE THAT FROM THE PINK IT IS 
THE EASIEST CORE TO GET TO 
COLOUR HE IS PLAYING FOR THE BLACK 
IT WILL BE BLACK RED AND THE 
ANGLE TO MOVE THE DIFFICULT ONE 
I THINK HE PLAYED TO CANNON THE 
PINK HE WAS UNLUCKY TO HIT THE 
REDS VERY UNLUCKY 
HAS HE GONE TOO FAR HE MAY HAVE TO 
DROP IN BEHIND IF IT IS NOT A NATURAL ANGLE TO CANNON IT OUT 
IT WAS A NATURAL ANGLE BUT HE DID 
NOT CLIP THE RED QUITE AS HE 
INTENDED TOO THICK 
BETTER TO HIT 
IT LIKE THAT FROM BEHIND THEN HE 
WILL PUSH IT ON INTO THE MIDDLE OF 
THE TABLE 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN THIRTY EIGHT 
A SOLEMN RITE BACK IN THE FRAME 
O'SULLIVAN RIGHT BACK IN THE FRAME 
HE WOULD LOVE TO HIT THIS FROM 
BEHIND IT HE COULD HE WOULD SETTLE 
TO HIT 
THE RED L. DO NOT KNOW OF THE MIDDLE POCKET IS IN THE WAY IF 
HE JUST MISSES THE MIDDLE POCKET 
THAT IS AVAILABLE TO HIM 
IF HE GOES THE OTHER SIDE IT IS 
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THE BLACK IS 
SLIGHTLY THE WAY IF HE GOT THE 
LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE L. 
THINK HE CAN MAKE THE ANGLE NOW HE 
IS LOOKING AT TWICE ACROSS THE 
TABLE THAT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT 
THIS WOULD BE SOME SHOT IF HE COULD 
JUST LAND ON THE RED IF HE HITS IT 
AT ANY PACE HE WILL LEAVE IT ON 
FILE AND A MISS FOUL 
AND MISS 
I THINK IT IS WORTH A GO OF THE 
RIGHT SIDE OF THE TABLE 
RONNIE JUST HAVING A LOOK THERE 
SHOULD BE A LITTLE CHALK MARK THERE 
HE IS GOING TO TRY TWICE ACROSS AGAIN HE IS TRYING TO WOBBLE THIS IN THE 
JAWS OF THE POCKET IF HE GETS THIS 
IT WILL BRING THE HOUSE DOWN WHAT 
A SHOT AND HE AS GOT THE SNOOKER 
HAS THE AND HE HAS GOT THE 
SNOOKER HAS HE WHAT AN ESCAPE 
THAT WAS HE HAS NOT GOT THE 
SNOOKER BUT WHAT A SHOT 
HE USED THAT THAT PRETTY UNUSUAL 
METHOD TOWARDS THE CORNER POCKET TO 
HIT THE RED AND HOPE IT RAN SAFE 
WHICH IT DID 
HE HAS LEFT ALONG A STRAIGHT RED 
AND RONNIE HAS GOT ABSOLUTELY 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CUE BALL A 
GOOD CHANCE A GOOD CHANCE TO PINCH 
THIS OPENING FRAME 
ALI CARTER WAS VIRTUALLY OVER THE 
LINE WENT OF THAT PLANT UNTIL 
THAT PLANT HE WAS A BIT UNLUCKY 
HE HAS OR SCREW THAT CAN HE READS 
THIS NO OVER SCREWED HE SHOULD 
BE O. K. 
O'SULLIVAN NEEDS TO CLEAR UP ON WE 
UP TO THE PINK ONLY UP TO THE 
PINK 
CARTER WAS IN TWICE BUT DID NOT 
MAKE ENOUGH THE FIRST TIME IT WAS 
HIS OWN FAULT O'SULLIVAN LEADS BY 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE TO ZERO 
A COMPETITIVE OPENING FRAME BODES 
WELL FOR THE REST OF THIS SEASON 
MICHAEL THIS FINAL THE STATISTICS 
DO NOT PAINT VERY PRETTY PICTURE 
FROM ALI CARTER POT NO EIGHT TO ZERO 
THE LAST TIME THEY PLAYED IN 
IRELAND WAS AN UNBELIEVABLE SESSION 
HE SCORED FIVE CENTURIES 
DOES IT MATTER FROM ALI CARTER'S 
PERSPECTIVE TO REMEMBER THESE 
THINGS THINGS IT CAN MATTER YES IT CAN BE A 
MENTAL SCAR IT IS A HURDLE YOU 
CANNOT GET OVER ON THE OTHER HAND 
BACK TO THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE FINAL ME AND 
DENNIS I HAD BEATEN DENNIS A 
NUMBER OF TIMES BEFOREHAND DENNIS 
ON THE DAY DECIDED HE COULD HE 
COULD BE ME HE RAISED HIS GAME 
YOU WANT TO GET OFF TO A GOOD START 
THAT FIRST FRAME WHEN YOU LOOK 
BACK OVER THE MATCH YOU SAY IF 
ONLY I HAD CONVERTED THE FIRST 
FRAME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO 
DIFFICULT THAT MIGHT SO MUCH MORE 
DIFFERENT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO 
MUCH MORE DIFFERENT 
BACK TO THE SECOND FRAME I'M SURE 
DENIS IS ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED AT 
THE MERE MENTION OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE FINAL 
HIS BEST THE OF THE GREAT MAN 
HIMSELF NINETIES IT I LOVE IT 
ESPECIALLY IF THE GREAT MAN HIMSELF 
MENTIONS IT 
THE HE WAS UNLUCKY 
HE WAS 
UNLUCKY 
THAT MUST BE VERY TIGHT WHEN HE 
STARTS KNOCKING THE LONG ONES IN 
YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT 
YES THAT IS THE TIME TO WORRY HIS 
LONG POTTING HAS BEEN THE MOST 
SUSPECT PART OF HIS GAME 
REMEMBER HERE LAST YEAR HE SAID IF 
HE CANNOT KNOCK THE LONG ONES IN 
IT IS LIKE LOSING YOUR SERVE IN 
TENNIS 
IF YOU DO NOT THEM IN IT CAN CAN 
GET YOU IN FOR SUBSTANTIAL OR 
EVEN FRAME WINNING BREAK IT CAN 
I HAVE BEEN MOST IMPRESSED WITH 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN'S FOCUS 
THROUGHOUT THE SEVENTEEN DAYS 
HE HAS BEEN RELAXED AROUND THE 
VENUE UP IN THE PLAYERS' LOUNGE 
I THINK THOSE WORDS ARE TRUE OF 
MOST OF THE SEASON VERY HAPPY IN 
HIS DOMESTIC LIFE 
HE LOVES HIS RUNNING VERY LITTLE 
SIGN AND WE CAN SPOT OF THOSE 
DEPRESSIONS WHICH HAVE PLAYED HIM 
SPORADICALLY 
HE REFUSED TO GO INTO SPORADICALLY THEM THEY WERE NOT A GOOD BUNCH TO 
GO INTO 
DON'T BE SURPRISED IF HE GOES BACK 
FOR THE BLUE NO HE IS STAYING FOR 
THE BLACK HE HAS GOT TO GET THIS 
RIGHT 
HE HAS MISSED THE CANNON HE WAS 
TRYING TO CATCH THE END RED THERE 
WAS ONE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
AVAILABLE 
HE TRIED TO PICK ONE OF INSTEAD OF 
GOING FOR THE DIFFICULT BUNCH 
ONE OFF 
WELL HE HAS LEFT THE RED BUT THE 
PINK IS TIED UP BLACK IS NEAR THE 
CUSHION ALMOST STRAIGHT ON THE RED 
IF I DO MYSELF JUSTICE THE RESULTS 
WILL TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THAT 
IS WHAT O'SULLIVAN SAID A FEW DAYS 
AGO HE CERTAINLY LOOKS AS THOUGH 
HE IS GOING TO DO HIMSELF JUSTICE 
VERY CLEVER HE MADE SURE THAT HE 
CANNONED THE PINK HE CANNONED IT 
JUST ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AND HE 
BRINGS IT INTO PLAY HE MADE SURE 
BY PLAYING IT OFF ME TO STAY ON RED SOFTLY 
WELL HE IS FLYING AGAIN HE LOOKS 
IN THE FORM THAT HE SHOWED AGAINST 
STEPHEN HENDRY STEPHEN SAID THAT NO ONE HAD EVER 
PLAYED AGAINST HIM THE WAY RONNIE 
DID IN THAT SESSION HE JUST SAID 
HE HAD NEVER SEEN A BALL AND RONNIE 
NEVER MISSED WHEN HE GOT HIM 
HENDRY ALSO SAID HE IS A GREAT 
FRONT RUNNER IF YOU LET HIM GET IN 
FRONT HE WILL BURY YOU 
A FULL HOUSE AT THE CRUCIBLE IT 
REALLY DOES HAVE A UNIQUE ON THE ONS AMBIENCE 
WITHIN A RED AND A COLOUR OF 
CLINCHING A TWO TO ONE LEAD CARTER HAD 
FLEETING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FIRST 
FRAME 
SPREAD OVER SEVENTEEN DAYS YOU HAVE TO 
WIN SEVENTY ONE FRAMES TO WIN THE TITLE 
O'SULLIVAN SO FAR HAS WON FIFTY THREE COST 
TWENTY FIVE LAST TWENTY FIVE HE HAS LOST TWENTY FIVE 
LOOK AT THAT BEAUTIFUL POSITIONAL 
SHOT PLAYED WITH THE OPPOSITE HAND 
THERE L. THINK PEOPLE SOMETIMES DO 
NOT REALISE HE HAS DONE IT BECAUSE 
HE GETS AN PLAYS AS IF HE WAS 
PLAYING WITH HIS RIGHT HAND THERE 
IS NO DIFFERENCE REALLY HE LOOKS 
THE SAME BUT TO BE VIRTUALLY 
ONE ODD THING ABOUT O'SULLIVAN 
WHEN HE IS EATING HE HOLDS HIS 
KNIFE IN HIS LEFT HAND 
THE AIR OF TOTAL CERTAINTY WITH 
WHICH O'SULLIVAN HAS COMPILED THIS 
BREAK LOOKS VERY OMINOUS FOR CARTER 
O'SULLIVAN LEADS BY TWO TO ONE TWO TO ZERO 
AT THIS NOT THE START ALI CARTER 
WOULD HAVE WANTED TERRY GRIFFITHS 
IS ALI CARTER'S COACH AND MENTAL 
YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HIM FOR 
THREE SEASONS MENTOR 
YES I 
THINK THE BIG MOVE FOR HIM WAS LAST 
YEAR WHEN HE GOT IN THE TOP SIXTEEN FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IT HAS GIVEN HIM 
MORE SELF 
BELIEF HE 
HAS PLAYED 
REALLY WELL THIS YEAR 
YOU MUST BE 
REALLY PROUD OF WHAT HE HAS 
ACHIEVED THIS YEAR 
YES IT IS VERY 
SPECIAL TO BE IN THE WORLD FINAL 
IS SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL LET US 
HOPE HE CARRIES ON THE GOOD WORK 
AFTER TODAY 
YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE 
PLAYERS YOU WORK WITH MARK 
WILLIAMS STEPHEN HENDRY ALI 
CARTER YOU KNOW THEY HAVE 
DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES WHAT IS 
ALI CARTER LIKE 
A VERY EASY GOING 
MAD A THOUGHTFUL BOY VERY KEEN 
HE A VERY EASY GOING LAD HE IS 
DISAPPOINTED HE HAS NOT ACHIEVED 
MORE UP TO NOW IN HIS CAREER BUT 
IF HE KEEPS WORKING HE CAN ACHIEVE 
MORE 
HOW DID HE FEEL GOING INTO MORE THIS MATCH HE WAS TELLING ME HE 
COULD NOT SLEEP LAST NIGHT WAS A NO 
HE HAS NOT SLEPT VERY MUCH BUT 
THAT IS PART AND PARCEL OF THE 
CRUCIBLE 
THERE SHE COULD NOT SLEEP CRUCIBLE LAST NIGHT HE COULD NOT SLEEP 
LAST NIGHT WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE 
THE FIRE IS STRAIGHT IN YOUR FACE 
AND HE HAS HANDLED IT REALLY WELL 
IF ALI CARTER DOES NOT GO OUT THERE 
THINKING HE CAN BEAT RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN THERE IS NO POINT GOING 
OUT THERE AT ALL 
NO AND THAT 
PERFORMANCE THAT BELIEF COMES 
FROM PERFORMANCE HE HAS DONE THAT 
THIS WEEK HE HAS BEATEN MURPHY AND 
EBDON THAT IS WHERE YOU BUILD YOUR 
INNER STRENGTH FROM 
THE FIRST TWO 
FRAMES HAVE GONE THE WRONG WAY HE 
WILL HAVE TO SAY I WILL GET GOING 
NOW 
THE SECRET IS DON'T PANIC NOW WHETHER IN FRONT OR BEHIND YOU DO 
NOT PANIC PLAY THE GAME A SHOT AT 
A TIME AND LET HER SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
AFTER FOUR FRAMES 
TERRY IT IS 
GREAT THAT YOU ARE IN HIS CORNER L. 
KNOW HE WILL BE APPRECIATIVE OF 
THAT LET US SEE 
CARTER ALSO SAID THAT ONE OF THE 
SECRETS OF HIS TRANSFORMATION IS 
THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN BEATING 
HIMSELF UP IN HIS CHAIR AFTER 
MAKING A MISTAKE AND HE HAS BEEN 
MUCH BETTER AM LETTING IT GO AT 
LETTING IT GO 
WELL LET US SEE IF HE CAN KNOCK IN 
A LONG RED HERE TO GET HIMSELF 
GOING IT IS A DIFFICULT ONE HE 
HAS GOT TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN 
BECAUSE HE IS NOT GETTING A CHANCE 
HE DID IN THE OPENING FRAME BUT 
THAT SECOND FRAME HE COULD NOT DO 
ANYTHING ABOUT HE HAS LOOKED AT 
THE POT THERE IS NO EASY SAFETY 
SHOT ON HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE A GO 
AT IT 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONFIDENCE 
BOOSTER HE WOULD NOT HAVE CANNONED 
INTO THE REDS HAD HE MADE THE 
CORRECT CONTACT 
I AM NOT SURE IF THE BLACK POTS 
ALI CARTER WILL BE A LITTLE ANXIOUS 
TO KNOW IF IT DOES RONNIE HAS HAD 
A LOOK AT IT IT MUST BE TIGHT THE 
PINK IS OBVIOUSLY AVAILABLE HE IS 
LOOKING AT THE BLACK AGAIN THERE 
YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE EASIER 
TO PLAY ON THE PINK 
HE HAS ALREADY LOOK IN TO THE ONE 
TO THE RIGHT OF THE BLACK WILL 
STILL THIS LOOKING AT HE IS 
ALREADY LOOKING AT THE ONE TO THE 
RIGHT OF THE BLACK THAT LOOKS 
ABOUT PERFECT THIS ALREADY IS A 
GOOD CHANCE 
HE MAY GO INTO THE BUNCH HERE 
BECAUSE THERE ARE A FEW REDS 
AVAILABLE 
HE WILL RISK BRING A FEW MORE INTO 
PLAY BRINGING FEW MORE NOBODY NOBODY BETTER THAN O'SULLIVAN TO OPEN UP A 
BUNCH OF REDS AND RETAIN POSITION 
THAT IS DAMIEN HIRST THE ARTIST 
AND THIS IS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN THE 
ARTIST YOU ARE WATCHING ONE 
ARTIST WATCHING ANOTHER GREAT 
ARTIST 
WHERE DID THEY GET THOSE T. SHIRTS 
FROM QUESTION ON T. SHIRTS FROM 
NICE ONE BOYS 
SOMEONE LISTENS TO 
YOU ANYWAY 
I AM JUST GLAD THEY 
MANAGED TO GET THEM THIS IS 
FANTASTIC 
YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
YOU JUST HAVE TO SIT IN YOUR SEAT 
AND ADMIRE AS ALI CARTER HAS DONE 
IN MANY INSTANCES 
IT IS AMAZING REALLY 
HE WHEN THEY 
MET IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND TROPHY 
IN NOVEMBER O'SULLIVAN WON FIVE TO TWO HE 
MADE FIVE CENTURIES WHICH IS AN 
UNSURPASSABLE RECORD FOR A BEST OF 
NINE 
HE DOES LIKE A RECORD OUR NINE RONNIE 
SOMEONE UPSTAIRS IN THE PLAYERS' 
LOUNGE WILL BE ENJOYING THIS 
THAT IS ALREADY ENOUGH OF IT ALL 
THREE MORSELS DOTT CARTER HAS DONE 
POTTED A BALL FOR TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES 
THAT IS ALREADY ENOUGH FOR THREE 
MORE CARTER HAS ALREADY POTTED 
HAS NOT POTTED A BALL FOR TWENTY SEVEN 
MINUTES 
WELL THE LAST FRAME ONLY LASTED 
JUST OVER TEN MINUTES 
THIS ONE IS JUST COMING UP TO EIGHT 
MINUTES 
YOU COULD SAY CLIVE THE ROCKET 
HAS LIFTED OFF 
HE JUST MISSED THE CANNON HE COULD 
HAVE PLAYED THE DOUBLE MAYBE HE 
CAN STILL TRY IT 
THE SIXTY SECOND CENTURY 
OF THE TOURNAMENT WILL HAVE TO WAIT 
WITH A BREAK OF NINETY NINE O'SULLIVAN 
EXTENDS HIS LEAD TO THREE TO ZERO IT IS 
ALREADY LOOKING VERY OMINOUS FOR 
CARTER 
AS SO OFTEN IS THE CASE THAT A BIG 
BREAK FROM O'SULLIVAN THE SECRET 
LAY IN HOW HE OPEN THE BUNCH WHILE 
RETAINING POSITION 
YES THERE ARE 
THREE REDS AVAILABLE BUT THE ONE 
THAT IS NEXT TO THE BLACK IS THE 
ONE THAT RONNIE DECIDED I HAVE GOT 
TO GO INTO 
THEM HERE 
BECAUSE THAT 
RED IS 
AVAILABLE HE 
IS THE 
BEST IN 
THE BUSINESS 
AT THIS TYPE OF SHOT 
THAT IS WHERE HE IS STRIKING THE 
CUE BALL HE CREATES THE SPIN WHEN 
IT GOES INTO THE PACK IT STOPS AND 
THEN IT SPINS AGAIN JUST WATCH HOW 
IT STOPS AND THEN IT SPINS BACK A 
SECOND TIME THE WHITE ARCS ROUND 
AND THEN SPINS BACK AGAIN HE IS 
ONE OF THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS AT 
THAT TYPE OF SHOT 
WELL IT IS WARM IN THE CRUCIBLE AS 
I MENTIONED IT IS PRETTY MILD 
OUTSIDE BUT IT IS HOT INSIDE 
JUST FOR A MOMENT THE MACHINE 
MALFUNCTIONS ALBEIT AT DISTANCE CARTER'S FIRST POT FOR HALF AN HOUR 
VERY EARLY DAYS IN THIS FINAL THE 
MID SESSION INTERVAL COMING UP 
AFTER THIS ONE ALI WILL NOT BE TOO 
CONCERNED BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT HE 
COULD HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST FRAME 
ALSO BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR HIM 
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO GET ONE 
FRAME ON THE BOARD JUST ABOUT O. K. 
HE CAN PLAY FOR THE 
JUST ABOUT O. K. HE CAN PLAY FOR THE TWO REDS NEAR THE BLACK HE 
DOES NOT WANT TO HIT 
THE BACK OF 
THE BUNCH FULL BALL 
HE DID JUST FLICK IT BUT IT HAS 
TURNED OUT O. K. 
DEPENDING ON THE ANGLE HE HAS ON 
THE BLUE HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET 
TO THE END OF THE LINE THERE IF IT 
IS NOT STRAIGHT TISH 
HE MAY 
HAVE 
THE USE THE CUSHION 
BUT THAT 
IS 
WHERE HE WOULD 
LIKE TO 
GET ANYWAY 
IF IT IS NOT COMPLETELY STRAIGHT 
HE IS STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK AND HE 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET BACK ON TO IT 
WELL HE HAS PLAYED FOR THE ONE ON 
THE OTHER SIDE HE DOES NOT WANT TO 
GET TOO CLOSE TO THE CUSHION 
A VERY GOOD RESPONSE HERE FROM ALI 
CARTER CAN HE KEEP IT GOING 
COMING KNOWN TO HAVE A LOOK AT THAT 
RED YES COOK AND HER HE HAS A 
DELICATE LITTLE STUN SHOT UNTIL 
YES HE HAS A DELICATE LITTLE STUN 
SHOT 
I AM SURE HE IS GOING TO CONVERT 
THIS CHANCE HERE 
VERY CALM VERY 
COOL SO FAR BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY 
IDEAL 
HE HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO IDEAL HOLD FOR THESE REDS 
IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT TOO HARD IT 
NEEDED TO PULL UP WELL PLAYED 
SO JUST THIS RED AND A COLOUR OF 
REASONABLE VALUE AND CARTER WILL BE 
OFF THE MARK 
YES HE NEEDS TO 
LEAVE HIMSELF ON THE BROWN HERE 
THE PINK AND THE BLUE WOULD BE 
AWKWARD BUT THE BROWN WOULD DO 
WELL DONE TO ALI CARTER 
HE MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE OF A CENTURY 
BREAK WELL PLAYED 
THIS WOULD BE THE EIGHTY FIRST CENTURY OF 
HIS TWELVE YEAR PROFESSIONAL CAREER 
A CAREER WHICH HAD NEVER PREVIOUSLY 
LED TO HIM APPEARING IN FINAL HE 
HAS ONLY PREVIOUSLY BEEN IN TWO 
SEMI FINALS 
IN PURSUED ALSO OF THE SIXTY SECONDS 
CENTURY OF THE TOURNAMENT 
PURSUED THE RECORD IS SIXTY EIGHT PURSUE 
WHAT A START TO THIS YEAR'S WORLD 
FINAL 
HE HAS GOT THIS CENTURY ONE HUNDRED FOUR V. 
OF THE 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN LEADS BY THREE 
FRAMES TO ONE 
WHAT A RELIEF FOR ALI CARTER HE 
HAS FINALLY GOT A FRAME ON THE 
BOARD AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT 
CENTURY HOW DID YOU RATE THAT 
EFFORTS 
YOU DON'T NEED 
ME TO TELL EFFORTS ME YOU HOW IMPORTANT THAT RAIN 
WAS BUT THE WAY THAT HE REACHED THE 
FRAME WAS VERY IMPORTANT HE WAS 
NEVER GOING TO LOSE HIS CUE ACTION 
AT QUICKLY BUT EVEN SO EVERYONE 
STARTED TO THINK OH NO NOT A 
COMPLETE WALKAWAY FROM THAT 
PERSPECTIVE A LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF 
WE SHOULD RELEASE STRESS THAT THIS 
IS SUCH BIG OCCASION FOR ALI 
CARTER THE FIRST FINAL OF HIS 
CAREER AND AT THE CRUCIBLE IT IS 
RONNIE'S TWENTY EIGHT FINAL HOW MUCH TIME 
DOES IT TAKE YOU TO SETTLE INTO 
THIS 
WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THAT THIS FRAME HE WAS THREE NAIL DOWN IN 
THE BLINK OF AN EYE ONE CHANCE HAD 
SETTLED PRESENTED ITSELF AND HE 
HAD TO GET INTO IT IF HE HAD BEEN 
SITTING AT THE INTERVAL AT FOUR TO ZERO DOWN 
HE WOULD BE WONDERING WHAT WAS 
GOING ON 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN KNOWS 
WHAT ALI CARTER IS CAPABLE OF THEY 
HAD BEEN PRACTICE PARTNERS OVER THE 
YEARS 
YES AND WHETHER THAT MAKES YEARS ANY DIFFERENCE TO HOW YOU APPROACH 
A MATCH OR NOT IT IS DEBATABLE IT 
IS MORE THE CASE NOW THAT PLAYERS 
TENDS TO PRACTISE WITH OTHER 
PLAYERS QUITE OFTEN IT NEVER USED 
TO BE THE CASE L. NEVER USED TO 
PLAY TOO MUCH WITH OTHER TOP PROS I 
DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU IT IT IS A 
DIFFERENT SORT OF SITUATION DOES DOES IT DESTROY THE MYSTIQUE IN A WAY 
IT CAN TAKE A BETTER WAY IT CAN 
TAKE AWAY THE FEAR FACTOR L. FOUND 
THAT OUT AS AN AMATEUR NEVER 
USED TO PLAY WITH PROFESSIONALS ARE 
TOLD THEY DON'T NEED TO KNOW YOUR 
GAME AND KEEP IT THAT WAY ALI ALI CARTER HAS HIS NAME ON THE BOARD 
THREE TO ONE THEY WILL TAKE TEA AND WE WILL 
DISTRACT ATTENTION FOR A FEW 
MOMENTS AT THIS TIME OF YEAR MANY 
OF YOU SPEND A LOT OF HOURS IN 
FRONT OF THE TELEVISION WATCHING 
SNOOKER WHEN YOU PROBABLY MIGHT NOT 
OTHERWISE WE ARE PROBABLY 
DISTRACTING YOU FROM WEEKEND CHORES 
SUCH AS DIY YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY 
ONE THERE ARE SOME WELL KNOWN 
CELEBRITIES WHO ARE AT THIS TIME OF 
YEAR GOING SNOOKER LOOPY 
IT WAS PART OF MY GROWING UP 
SNOOKER I PLAYED HELLUVA LOT 
FROM THE AGE OF ABOUT FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN 
ESPECIALLY WHEN I STARTED FOOTBALL 
I USED TO GO TO TRAINING IN THE 
MORNINGS AND FOOTBALLERS GET A LOT 
OF FREE TIME EVERY AFTERNOON I 
USED TO GO AND PLAY FOR HOURS AND 
HOURS AND HOURS 
SNOOKER MEANS 
TENSION EXCITEMENT FEAR SOMETIMES 
IF YOUR FAVOURITE PLAYER IS ON THE 
SKIDS ABOVE ALL IT MEANS HUGE 
ENJOYMENT AND YEARS OF PLEASURE IT IT CONJURES UP ME AT ABOUT EIGHT YEARS 
OF AGE ON CHRISTMAS MORNING COMING 
DOWN AND HAVING A SIX F. T. SNOOKER 
TABLE WHICH WENT OVER THE TOP OF 
THE DINING TABLE AND AT FOUR A M. MY 
BROTHER WAS OUT PLAYING IT A A FANTASTIC GAME L. AM A REAL FAN MY MY GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDAD ALWAYS 
WATCH THE SNOOKER AND I USED ALWAYS 
GO ROUND THEIR HOUSE OF AN EVENING 
AT THE WEEKENDS AND WITHOUT A DOUBT 
THERE WOULD BE SNOOKER ON THE 
TELEVISION IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME 
THEN AS IT IS NOW THEY WILL BE 
GLUED TO THE SET 
AS A GAME TO 
WATCH I THINK IT HAS GOT 
PARTICULAR DRAMA AND TENSION IN 
ITSELF AS A GAME TO PLAY IT HAS 
GOT AWKWARD MEMORIES ASSOCIATED 
WITH IT FOR ME TO BE HONEST L. AM TERRIBLE 
WHEN I SAY THE WORDS TERRIBLE KNITTER WHAT KIND OF IMAGES IS 
THAT A FIAT 
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T 
WELL CRONJE FOR YOU 
I PLAYED 
FOR LEICESTER IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
AND GARY LINEKER WAS THERE HE WAS 
QUITE GOOD BUT THE REST OF THE BOYS 
WOULD GO DOWN AND PLAY SNOOKER ALL 
AFTERNOON L. WAS NEVER ANY GOOD AT IT 
I MADE QUITE A FEW HUNDRED IT BREAKS L. USED TO PRACTISE MOST 
DAYS L. WOULD WATCH WILLIE IN THE 
TOURNAMENTS UTTERLY GOT FAT AND 
BALD 
I DO HAVE A THING THAT I NEED BALD AT LEAST FOUR POINTS IN MAY BEFORE 
THE CUE ACTION IS REMOTELY 
ACCEPTABLE ME 
THAT BEAUTIFUL 
BEAUTIFULLY DONE 
CONSIDERING I 
HAVE A PHOBIA 
I PLAYED WITH HENDRY 
HE GAVE ME A LESSON ONCE AND IT 
OBVIOUSLY PAID DIVIDENDS 
I THOUGHT 
THAT WAS QUITE IMPRESSIVE 
YES I 
WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO HOLD IT THERE THERE WAS A CELEBRITY TOURNAMENT L. WAS 
THERE AND YOU HAD TO AUCTION TO PAY 
PLAY WITH STEVE DAVIS AND STEPHEN 
HENDRY IMAGINE HAVING AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITH THOSE SO 
IBEX TO HAVE A GAME IT WAS A 
FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE THE ONLY 
THING IS STEPHEN HENDRY I BROKE 
AND HE CLEARED THE TABLE 
IT WOULD 
HAVE TO BE ALEX HIGGINS L. USED TO 
ADORE HIM L. PLAY LEFT HANDED IT 
IS THE ONLY THING I DO LEFT HANDED 
EVERYONE ASKED ME WHY BUT I SAID 
IT WAS BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE LIKE 
ALEX HIGGINS BUT IN FACT HE PLAYED 
RIGHT HANDED L. DON'T KNOW WHERE HE 
GOT THAT FROM L. USED TO SAY IT 
BECAUSE OF ALEX HIGGINS 
IF YOU 
GROW UP IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN 
THEIR SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES AND 
SOMEBODY SAID I'M ALEX HIGGINS 
THERE WAS REALLY NO ONE ELSE TO GO 
I ENDED UP BEING DENNIS TAYLOR BUT 
THAT WAS BEFORE DENNIS WON THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS SO THAT WAS 
QUITE UNCOOL 
TERRY AND I ARE FROM 
THE SAME TOWN AND PEOPLE ARE NOT 
GOING TO BELIEVE IT L. HAVE NEVER 
MET MY GREAT HERO TERRY GRIFFITHS 
IT IS ONE OF MY GREAT AMBITIONS 
ONE TO VISIT THE CRUCIBLE WHICH I 
HAVE PROBABLY CENT SPENT YEARS OF 
MY LIFE WATCHING AND TWO THE IDEAL 
COMBINATION TO MEET TERRY AT THE 
CRUCIBLE THE SUMMIT 
I LOVE 
WATCHING RONNIE O'SULLIVAN PLAY 
YOU NEVER QUITE KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT 
I THINK THAT ADDS TO IT YOU CAN 
NEVER BE SURE WHICH RONNIE 
TURN UP 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT 
STEWART BIRDS IS INDEED ON HIS WAY 
HE'S COMING TO THE FINAL TOMORROW 
WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING 
HIM TOMORROW HUGH EDWARDS 
AS THE PROFESSIONALS WILL TELL YOU 
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR CUE CAN 
BE VERY PERSONAL VERY SPECIAL AND 
A LITTLE UNHEALTHY AT TIMES 
FROM BOYS TO MAN A SNOOKER 
PLAYER'S ASSOCIATION WITH A CUE CAN 
LAST MANY YEARS BUT THAT IS NOT 
ALWAYS THE CASE MOST FAMOUSLY 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN GAVE AWAY HIS 
CURE AFTER DEFEAT TWO YEARS AGO AND 
THE MAN CHARGED WITH MAKING HIM A 
NEW ONE WAS THIS MAN 
WITH RONNIE'S 
YOU FROM THE KICK OFF FROM THE 
CALL COMING INTO THE CUE BEING 
READY WAS SIX WEEKS ALTHOUGH THERE 
IS A LONG PROCESS PRIOR TO THAT 
WHERE WE ALREADY HAD THE SHAFT SETS 
TO ONE SIDE IF WE HADN'T HAD THOSE 
RUNNING MAY HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT 
NEARLY YEAR 
RONNIE THE THE PLAYERS THEMSELVES NO WHAT ITS SIZE 
OR WHAT WEIGHT THEY WOULD LIKE BUT 
IT IS CASE OF SELECTING THE RIGHT 
COMBINATION THE RIGHT COMBINATION 
AND THE RIGHT SHAFTS IT IS A CASE 
OF SELECTING THE RIGHT ONE THAT HAS 
THE RIGHT THROW AND SWING FOR THAT 
PARTICULAR PLAYER NORMALLY 
AND PICK A LARGE SELECTION OF WOOD 
WE ONLY END UP WITH AROUND ABOUT TWO PER CENT 
OF THE WOODS THAT WOULD RUN AWAY 
I'M LOOKING FOR A CLEAN BOARDS 
STRAIGHTNESS OF GRAIN NO NOT SO 
THE RIGHT DENSITY NOT SO 
NORMALLY THE BOARDS ARE BETWEEN 
EIGHT AND SIXTEEN F. T. LONG WE WILL BRING 
US BACK CUT THEM INTO LENGTHS FOR 
HER IN ONE PIECE OR A THREE QUARTER 
CUE FROM THERE WE SPLIT IT DOWN 
INTO INCH SQUARES WE LEAVE THAT 
FOR A TIME FOR THE WOODS TO SETTLE 
DOWN AND STABILISED THEN WE CHECK 
THROUGH THEM AGAIN AND PICK THE 
ONES WITH THE NICEST LOOKING GRAIN 
FROM THERE IT IS TAKEN DOWN IN 
VARIOUS STAGES FROM SQUARE TO 
OVERSIZE TAPERS IN THREE OR FOUR 
GOES UNTIL WE GET TO A FINAL SHAFT 
SIZE 
THE SPICING IS PARTLY DECORATIVE 
PARTLY IT ADDS A NICE BALANCE TO 
THE CARE IT IS ALSO NORMALLY A 
DENSER WOOD SAW IT AS A NICE TO 
FEEL A SMOOTHER FINISH SO IT 
HAS IT GIVES A GOOD NATURAL WEIGHT 
AND BALANCE TO THE WOOD 
THERE IS PROBABLY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY 
DIFFERENT SPECIES OUT THERE THE 
MAIN ONES THAT WE USE OUR THE EBONY 
AND ROSEWOOD FOR THE MAIN 
COMPONENTS THAT IS INLAID WITH 
VARIOUS THINGS LIKE OLIVE WOOD 
ROSEWOOD PURPLE HEARTS SNAKE 
WOULD SOME OF THE REALLY 
DECORATIVE ONES SOME OF THE CUES 
ARE ONE PIECE BUT THE MAJORITY TO 
HAVE JOINTS IN THEM WE TAKE A LOT 
OF TROUBLE OVER FITTING THESE 
JOINTS IF YOU'RE GOING TO CUT 
CUE IN HALF IT IS IMPORTANT THAT 
IT FEELS AS GOOD AND SOLID AS 
BEFORE IT WAS CUT SO WE TAKE LOT 
OF TIME AND TROUBLE IN RUSSIAN 
FITTING THE CONNECTIONS 
PRECISION 
THE TIP IS THE BUSINESS END OF THE 
CUE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU GET 
GOOD FIT SO WE PRECISION TURNED 
THE END OF THE SHAFT TO WITHIN OH ONE 
OF A MILLIMETRE WE COMPRESS THE 
WOOD SLIGHTLY AS WE PUT THE TAPE ON 
IT IS DESIGNED TO GO ON SLIGHTLY 
TIGHT TIGHT AND THEN 
IT IS CASE OF LEVELLING IT OFF HITTING GOOD QUALITY TAPE 
AND SHIPPING IT TO A NICE SHAPE SO 
THAT AS IT CONTACTS WITH THE CUE 
BALL YOU HAVE A DOME ON THE TIP SO 
THAT WHENEVER YOU GET THE CUE BALL 
IT IS SIMILAR SHAPED PIECE SO 
THAT IT IMPARTS AN OFF SPINNER THE 
CUES ARE AND PLANED INTO THEIR 
FINAL TAKE HER TO GET THE RIGHT 
SIZE THERE IS LONG PROCESS 
PROBABLY GOING THROUGH EIGHT OR 
NINE DIFFERENT SANDING OPERATIONS 
TO GET IT SUPER SMOOTH FROM 
COURSE PAPER TO GET THE PLANING 
MARKS OUT DOWN TO VIRTUALLY A NON 
EXISTENT GRADE JUST TO PUT A SUPER 
FIND US ON THAT WE ALSO PATTERN 
THE GRAIN IT ADDS TO THE 
SMOOTHNESS OF THE CUE WE ALSO DO 
AND WILL FINISH WHAT YOU SEE IS 
WHAT YOU GET IT NEEDS TO BE SUPER 
SMOOTH SO THAT IT WINDS ACROSS THE 
BOARD GLIDES IN MOST SPORTS 
PLAYERS LIKE BUYING THE EQUIPMENT 
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN UNFORTUNATELY 
IN SNOOKER PEOPLE HAVE ACCUSED 
SOMETIMES FOR LIFE SO I DON'T GET 
TOO MANY REPEAT CUSTOMERS A CUE 
I SUPPOSE IT GOES WITH THE 
TERRITORY OF MAKING GOOD PROJECT 
IT IS A REAL ART ASH OR MAPLE 
WHICH YOU PREFER 
WE ARE BUT 
STEPHEN HENDRY IS ABLE 
I HAVE 
ALWAYS BEEN ASH IT TENDS TO I 
THINK UNABLE CUES USED TO BE A 
LITTLE BIT MORE POROUS L. WAS BUT 
MABEL WAS A BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO 
PLAY BUT ASHE WAS OR WAS A LITTLE 
BIT BETTER 
I THINK THAT IS FOR THE 
CONNOISSEURS ANY CUES HAVE YOU 
USED 
THE FIRST ONE WAS NOT MUCH USED COP BUT THEY GOOD ONE THAT I GOT 
MADE WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS STOLEN THE 
NEXT ONE WAS STOLEN ON A CENTRE TO 
GET REPAIRED SO I AM ON MY FOURTH 
THIS ONE IS ABSOLUTELY FINE BUT 
THE ONE I WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP WITH 
THAT WAS A PROPER CARE YOU'RE YOU'RE TITLES THE SAINT EWE SAME AT KEW 
I WON THE MASTERS AGAINST RONNIE 
WITH JOHN'S YEAR L. BORROWED MY 
FATHER'S ONCE NOW I'M BACK WITH MY 
ORIGINAL THE TWO OF US ARE GOING 
TO SEE IT THROUGH TO THE RETIREMENT 
STAGE 
IT IS SAD TO HEAR MORE FROM STAGE OUR CELEBRITY FRIENDS TIME TO 
HERE 
NO CONTEST I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU 
BACK TO NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WHEN THE GREAT TERRY 
GRIFFITHS WON THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP BUT THE FINAL WASN'T 
THE BEST MATCH BECAUSE AS I RECALL 
VERY CLEARLY THE SEMI AGAINST 
EDDIE CHARLTON WAS BY FAR THE BEST 
MATCH OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP YOU 
COULD IMAGINE THE COMBINATION OF 
STEADY EDDY AND TERRY BOTH OF THEM 
SPENDING HOURS OVER SAFETY PLAY NO 
BALLS POTTED ARE TOLD L. THINK THE 
MATCH LASTED ABOUT THREE AND A HALF 
WEEKS 
THE ONE THAT STICKS IN MY WEEKS MIND WAS WHEN CLIFF THORBURN GOT 
THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THAT WAS A BIG THING 
PEOPLE WERE CALLING PEOPLE IN FROM 
THE STREET HAVE YOU SEEN THIS IT 
WAS SUCH A GOOD MEMORY BECAUSE HE 
WAS NEVER MY FAVOURITE PLAYER I I THINK IT WAS NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND HE PLAYED 
JIMMY WHITE ON THAT OCCASION 
EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT IS NOT IN THE 
BACK BUT YOU ALWAYS THINK THIS IS 
HIS CHANCE THIS IS HIS MOMENT AND 
I THINK THE MOMENT WAS WHEN HE 
MISSED THE BLACK OF THE SPOT THE 
AUDIENCE COMES DOWN AND STEPHEN 
HENDRY CAME BACK CAUGHT IT BACK 
AND WENT ON TO WIN AT THAT MOMENT 
YOU WERE THINKING IS HE EVER GOING 
TO WIN IT 
WHEN HIGGINS BROKE DOWN 
AND CRIED THAT WAS JUST A VERY 
EMOTIONAL MOMENT L. L. THINK HE WAS 
WITHOUT A DOUBT FOR ME THE GUY 
WHO REALLY MADE SNOOKER INTO VERY 
MUCH A POPULAR SPORT THE MEMORY OF 
HIGGINS WHEN HE PLAYED IT WAS FOR 
ME QUITE A MEMORABLE MOMENT I I USED TO LIKE TO WATCH IT ON BLACK 
AND WHITE WHICH HAD A CERTAIN 
CHALLENGE JUST FOR THE 
COMMENTATORS A BALL INTO ANOTHER 
BALL LIKE THAT L. MISS THAT 
PROBABLY THE SAME AS EVERYONE 
ELSE'S DENNIS TAYLOR THAT ONE AN 
UNFORGETTABLE MOMENT WAS AT HOME 
IT WAS JUST ENTHRALLING GRIPPING 
ABSOLUT DRAMA 
A MAN WITH GLASSES 
UPSIDE DOWN 
I LIKE THE TACTICS 
SIDE OF IT L. THINK MY FORTE WAS 
TACTICS L. DIDN'T ALWAYS LEAD FROM 
THE FRONT I CAME FROM THE BACK 
TACTICS 
I LOVE TACTICAL BATTLES L. TACTICS DO LIKE THE RAPID FIRE ROY ON 
SULLIVAN ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THAT IS A SPECTACULAR 
THING TO WATCH RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
I DO ENJOY IT TWO FANTASTICALLY 
GOOD PLAYERS TRYING TO OUTWIT EACH 
OTHER WITH REALLY SKILFUL SAFETY 
PLAY 
I SAFETY SAFETY 
WHAT IS PLAY THAT 
I LIKE BIG BREAKS WATCHING THAT THEM CONTROL THE RIGHT BALL 
A BIG 
BREAKERS LIKE A GIRL WALKING PAST 
WITH A SHORT SKIRT WHEREAS A 
TACTICAL BATTLE IS WOULD I MARRY 
HER THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN 
OFF THREE CUSHIONS AND IN BEHIND 
THE GREEN 
IT HAS IT IT IS A 
SLIGHTLY MESMERIC THING IT IS HOW 
I FEEL ABOUT CRICKET L. DON'T 
REALLY WATCH CRICKET BUT WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN IS THAT THE TELEVISION WILL 
BE THERE AND ON AND YOU WILL START 
TO WATCH 
IT IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE 
FOR ME L. CAN'T PLAY SNOOKER I AM 
THE WORLD'S WORST PLAYER AND EVERY 
TIME IT IS ON THE TELLY I CAN TURN 
OFF THE TELLY L. L. DON'T LIKE IT COMES 
I WILL BE WATCHING BECAUSE I COMES DON'T WATCH IT I WATCHED EVERY 
YEAR IF I'M NOT IN I TAKE IT L. 
DON'T LIKE TO MISS ANY FRIENDS ARE 
TOLD 
FROM BEGINNING TO END NO IT TOLD NO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO'S PLAYING IF I 
HAVE GOT THROUGH THREE FRAMES 
THAT'S IT YOU CAN CANCEL 
EVERYTHING I'M GOING TO BE IN THE 
SAME UNDERPANTS FOR TWO WEEKS 
CALLING FOR BE SOME 
I MIGHT TURN 
UP IN SHEFFIELD IT WOULD BE QUITE 
NICE JUST FOR THE FINAL SESSION 
EVERYONE IS IN TUXEDOS AND I'LL BE 
THERE IN MY Y. FRONTS LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN PLEASE WELCOME 
PADDY 
PADDY IS PROBABLY STILL SITTING ON HIS SO 
FAR WHAT AN IMAGE FASCINATING 
RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION BREAKS OR 
TACTICAL BATTLES DID THAT SURPRISE 
YOU 
I 
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT PEOPLE YOU WOULD HAVE GONE FOR THE BIG BREAKS 
EVERYBODY LIKES TO SEE THE WAY THE 
CUE BALL GETS MOVED AROUND THAT'S 
WHAT MAKES AGAIN INTERESTING SOME 
PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE THE TACTICAL 
SIDE A NOT MUCH TACTICS SO FAR IN 
THIS MATCH 
IT IS GOING TO BE QUICK 
AND IT HAS BEEN QUITE SO FAR IT IT CERTAINLY HAS THEY HAVE BEEN 
GETTING ON WITH IT SAFETY PLAY IS 
IMPORTANT THAT ONCE THEY HAVE AN 
OPENING THEY ARE MAKING THE MOST 
OF IT 
FOUR MOORE PLAYS FRAMES TO 
PLAY IN THIS FINAL ARE YOU 
ENJOYING IT SO FAR 
ABSOLUTELY AN 
INTERESTING START RONNIE WINNING 
THE FIRST THREE FRAMES YOU WERE 
GETTING CONCERNED BECAUSE AS WE 
ALWAYS SAY YOU DON'T FEEL IT 
PLAYER EVER SETTLES UNTIL HE GETS 
HIS FIRST FRAME ON THE SCOREBOARD 
ALI DID THAT IN STYLE FIRST 
CENTURY OF THE MATCH HE PROVED 
THAT GIVEN THE CHANCE HE WILL 
SCORE 
THE PLOT WAS MADE DIFFICULT BECAUSE 
HE HAD TO GET BEHIND THE PACK HE 
DID THAT AND LUCKILY THE RED IS 
SAFE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER RED 
IS GOING WHEN YOU PLAY A SHOT LIKE 
THAT A COUPLE OF CASES LATER IT 
IS NOT AS WE NOT A 
STRAIGHTFORWARD SAFETY KISSES 
JUST ABOUT GOT THE EMPLOYMENT OUT 
OF THE WAY EMPLOYMENTS 
IMPLEMENTS JUST GOT IT OUT OF THE 
WAY LIKE A MATADOR 
THERE IS A CHANCE RONNIE COULD TAKE 
AS READ ON THIS RED 
NO JUST A SAFETY HE HAS GOT A 
PERFECT WINE LINE BEHIND THE 
BROWN 
JUST A TAD FORTUNATE HE WAS 
PLAYING BEHIND GREEN AND BROWN BUT 
HE DIDN'T HIT THE INTENDED READ HE 
PLAYED THE SECOND RED OF THE TWO 
A LOT OF IT WILL DEPEND HOW CLOSE 
HE IS TO THE BROWN NOTHING EASY 
THE WAY THE REDS ARE SPREAD A BIT 
OF A PROBLEM THIS 
IF THAT RAN THAT COULD HAVE BEEN 
FANTASTIC IT WAS NOT A BAD LINE 
HE WILL TRY IT AGAIN IT IS JUST 
WHEN IT COMES OFF THAT FOURTH CUSHION 
IT SLIDES OF THAT OFF 
THE HARDER YOU HIT IT THE MORE IT 
WILL SLIDE OF THE THIRD EDITION AND 
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED 
THE WORST 
THING IS HE HAS LEFT RONNIE A 
CHANCE 
A TOUGH GAME ISN'T IT WHEN YOU 
WERE ON A NINETY PER CENT SUCCESS RATE AND YOU 
WERE THREE TO ONE BEHIND A CHANCE OF THAT 
SCORELINE BEING EVEN WORSE 
HIS BODY LANGUAGE TELLS ME HE'S GOT 
NOTHING HERE ONLY SAFETY 
DEPENDING ON WHETHER HE CAN GET 
BEHIND THE BROWN HE CAN JUST ABOUT 
GET BEHIND THE BROWN 
NOT QUITE TIGHT BEHIND IT BUT IT IS 
O. K. 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE IS A O. K. PATH BACK BUT ALI CARTER WILL BE 
VERY RELIEVED IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU 
GET AWAY WITH LEAVING RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THAT 
CAN HE SNEAK PAST THIS BLUE L. WAS 
NEVER ANY GOOD FROM LOOKING BEHIND 
THE SHOT 
HE HAS DECIDED THAT THIS IS WORTH 
IT IS A THIN ONE WELL PLAYED HE WAS IN A TRICKY POSITION THERE 
A RED ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE 
AVAILABLE FOR THE RIGHT CORNER 
GOT THAT ONE THICKER THAN HE WANTED 
HE NEEDS HELP FROM THE GREEN 
WITH HIS HAND ON THE TABLE WE 
SHOULD GET THE UPPER HAND HERE 
ALI 
IT'S A GOOD LINE IT'S A PRETTY 
GOOD SHOT 
THE BEST VENUE IN SNOOKER A BIT 
CRAMPED BUT THIS NUMBER ONE TABLE 
PERFECT 
A KISS ON THE YELLOW WOULD BE NICE 
AND HE GOT IT 
THE NEXT MISTAKE BY EITHER PLAYER 
ON A SAFETY COULD COST THEM THE 
FRAME 
IT'S NOT FAR OFF THE NINETY PER CENT THERE WAS 
SAVED IF IF YOU CAN GET NINETY PER CENT IN 
EVERY ASPECT OF THE GAME THEY 
ALWAYS SAY YOU CAN WIN A LOT MORE 
MATCHES THAN YOU WILL LOSE ALI 
THINKS HE CAN FIND A SAFE PLACE FOR 
THIS CUE BALL BY LEAVING IT ON THE 
TOP CUSHION BUT THE RED HE HAS 
PLAYED HAS GONE TO THE RIGHT CENTRE 
THIS COULD MAKE THE SHOT SLIGHTLY 
MORE DIFFICULT THE FACT HE WANTS 
TO STUN THIS IN 
WHY YOU KNOW LISTEN TO ME WHY IN 
THE WHY YOU NO LISTEN TO ME 
A BIT FORTUNATE TO GET SUCH A NICE 
ANGLE ON THE ALLOA CONSIDERING HE 
WAS PLAYING FOR THE BLUE ON THE 
YELLOW 
JUST THE TWO MORE LOOSE RED BEFORE 
HE RISKS GET IN AND THE BLACK 
GETTING ON TO THE BLACK 
COMING AROUND TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK 
THESE THREE REDS 
THIS IS WHERE THE WORK STARTS 
ELITE FORTY THREE MORE RED TO MORE COLOURS 
VISIT THIS BRAIN HE NEEDS TWO 
MORE CHORUS TO WIN THIS FRAME 
CONNORS MACRO 
JUST THIS BLACK NEEDED TO GO SEVENTY TWO IN 
FRONT SEVENTY TWO POINT IN FRONT 
PLAYED SOME EXCELLENT SAFETY IN 
THE END FOR US A MISTAKE FROM ALI 
CARTER ASTHMA FORCED THE MISTAKE 
WHEN HE DOES GET IN AMONG THE BALLS 
THERE IS AN AIR OF THAT ABILITY 
AROUND IT 
AT HE HAS LOOKED SO PLEASE DON'T 
BEEN THROUGH IT IS YOUR PICTURE HE HAS LOOKED COMPLETELY IN THE 
ZONE OR THAT TO BE DUE 
THROUGHOUT THIS CHAMPIONSHIP 
IT WAS A DESPERATE ATTEMPT AT A 
PLANT TRYING TO MAKE A CENTURY 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN GOES ANOTHER 
FRAME IN FRONT 
IN THE MEDIA ROOM WITH PHIL YATES 
AND OF ALL SNOOKER KNOWLEDGE GREAT 
PLAY AGAIN FROM ROE MILL SULLIVAN 
THE IT IS GOING TO EXPECTATIONS 
PEOPLE EXPECTED HIM TO WIN WITH A 
SESSION TO WERE L. L. THINK IT WAS 
UNLIKELY ALI CARTER IS VERY FEISTY 
I THINK HE WILL SUDDENLY GET IT TO 
EIGHTEEN TO TEN 
THAT IS HAVE A LOOK AT THE WORLD 
RANKINGS HE IS THE ORDER FOR NEXT 
SEASON 
TO GET INTO NO SEVEN IS A BIG SEASON ADVANTAGE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN WILL 
HAVE ACUTE THAT BAD IT AT THE TOP 
IF HE WINS THIS JAN BRIDGET THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP IT IS THE FIRST TIME 
THAT A PLAYER HAS BEEN NUMBER ONE 
ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS FOUR 
NEW ADDITIONS TO THE TOP SIXTEEN WE 
HAVE JOE PERRY MARCO FU MARK KING 
AND MARK ALAM AND MARK ALLEN HE 
WAS DEVASTATED BY HIS FIRST ROUND 
DEFEAT TO STEPHEN HENDRY BUT NOW 
HE WILL BE BACK AMONG THE TOP SIXTEEN 
NEXT WEEK THAT MARK NEXT SEASON 
THERE IS INCREDIBLE STRENGTH THE 
DEPTH IN THE QUALIFIERS ISN'T 
THERE MOST OF THEM HOUR CRUCIBLE 
SEMI FINALIST AND B. B. C. TWO UP TO 
PULL OFF BY FOUR MAJOR TOURNAMENTS 
IF YOU ARE IN THE BOTTOM HALF YOU 
NEED TO AT LEAST WHEN ONE MATCH AS 
KEN DOHERTY LED AT THE CRUCIBLE FOR 
THE LAST TIME HAS MARK WILLIAMS 
THAT IS A PREPOSTEROUS SUGGESTION 
MARK LI TIE BUT WON THE TITLE AGAIN 
NEARLY WENT IN OFF HE PUT HIS HAND 
UP AND APOLOGISED WILL BE IF WILLIE 
IS SOUNDING A BIT DOWN LEICESTER 
HAVE GONE DOWN 
I AM A FLAYED SO BAK I AM AFRAID 
SO AM LITTLE DEFLATED THIS 
AFTERNOON THE ONLY THING I AM 
ENJOYING HIS WATCHING THIS FINAL 
LEICESTER DREW AT STOKE AND 
SOUTHAMPTON ONE PEOPLE LIKE CARLISLE 
COMING TO LEICESTER NEXT YEAR 
PERISH THE THOUGHT 
THE IMPORTANT THING WHEN PLAYING 
THAT SAFETY WAS TO TRY TO COVER AN 
ESCAPE DOWN THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF 
THE TABLE HE HAS JUST MISSED OUT 
IT CAUGHT THAT A LITTLE THICK 
POSSIBILITY OF THIS RED TOWARDS THE 
RIGHT CORNER WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING 
SOMEONE LIKE RONNIE THERE'S 
PRESSURE ON EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR 
GAME EVERY TIME YOU GO FOR A POT 
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS YOU KNOW IF 
YOU DO IT GET IT WILL I GET 
ANOTHER SHOT 
HE IS TAKING IT ON HE CONTROL THE CUE BALL ABSOLUTELY 
BEAUTIFULLY WELL PLAYED 
HE CONTROLLED 
HE PLAYED IT SO 
WELL HE HAS A PERFECT ANGLE ON THE 
BLACK TO MOVE THE RED OF THE 
BLACKSPOT THAT WAS A DOUBLE BONUS 
HIS FIRST LONG POT OF THE MATCH AND 
HE GOT A PERFECT ANGLE 
THIS IS A GREAT CHANCE TO WIN A 
FRAME AT ONE VISIT AND THAT'S WHAT 
HE HAS TO DO 
NOT IDEAL THESE REDS THE MIDDLE 
REDS OF THOSE SIX THAT IS THE END 
HE NEEDS TO GET ONTO THE BLACK IT 
BEGAN IF HE CAN THIS IS THE KEY 
SHOT 
I DID NOT THINK HE HAS PLAYED THAT 
WELL ENOUGH 
EID YOU WANT TO COME STRAIGHT ON 
THE BLACK YOU DO NOT WANT TO 
COME STRAIGHT 
HE GOT INTO THE CUE BALL TOO MUCH 
WHEN A STORE WHEN I SAW HIM 
STRIKING THE CUE BALL AT LOW I 
THOUGHT HE COULD NOT BE PLAYING 
THAT CANNON HE NEEDED A STUN SHOT 
FOR STUN SHOT 
JUST HIT THE BALL JUST BELOW CENTRE TOO MUCH 
BACKSPIN IT IS THOSE SITUATIONS 
THAT ONE CANNON PLAYED CORRECTLY 
OPEN TOP FRAME COMPLETELY OPENS 
UP FRAME THAT BASICALLY IS THE 
DIFFERENCE WHEN RONNIE GET IN THAT 
SITUATION HE DO NOT EXPECT HIM TO 
NOT MAKE THE MOST OF THEM 
DISAPPOINTED IT WAS GOOD OPENING RED PREMATURE END 
NOT THE BEST OF SAFETY BUT NO POT 
ON TO GET ONTO A CHOIR COLOUR 
THE RED IN OPEN PLAY HE CANNOT DO 
ANYTHING WITH THE CUE BALL THERE 
IT USED TO IT IS TOO RISKY 
THAT IS ALL HE COULD DO THE 
CONTAINING SAFETY 
HE HAS GOT TO KEEP IT I HE HAS 
GOT TO KEEP IT TIGHT WITH RONNIE 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE FACED 
WITH THAT UPPED SAFETY SHOT AT YOUR 
NEXT VISIT AT TOUGH SAFETY SHOT 
THIS IS THE SHOT HE PLAYED BEFORE 
HE JUST PUT TOO MUCH BACKSPIN ON 
FOR ME WHEN HE PLAYED THIS BLACK 
THAT WILL COME BACK TO THAT IN THE 
SECOND 
WELL THIS IS IT I JUST THOUGHT 
HE PLAYED THE STUN SHOT HE STRUCK 
VERY LOW THAT IS WHERE WE WERE 
THINKING HE SHOULD HAVE HIT THIS 
IS WHAT HE PLAYED WITH THE BACKS 
IN THE RED INTO THE REDS IF YOU 
PLAY IT WITH A STUN SHOT THAT IS 
WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR AND THAT 
IS WHAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY 
WITH 
THAT WAS ALWAYS TOP BECAUSE WITH IT WAS INTO A BLIND POCKET L. THINK 
HE HAS GOT RONNIE SLIGHTLY OFF 
COLOUR AT THE MOMENT THIS IS WHILE 
YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE WHEN THE SUN 
SHINES IF UKIP TWO CHANCES OF A 
FRAME AGAINST RONNIE YOU ARE DOING 
PRETTY WELL YOU WOULD BE HAPPY 
WITH ONE IF UKIP TWO CHANCES 
HE HAS GOT TO MAKE THESE COUNT THIS 
TIME 
I THINK HE WILL HAVE TO GO UP FOR 
THE BLUE GOOD ANGLE 
HE HAS NOT PLAYED IT VERY WELL 
JUST COMING AROUND TO SEE IF THERE 
IS ANYTHING AVAILABLE ALMOST 
STRAIGHT STRAIGHT ON THE WRONG 
SIDE 
IT WAS SUCH A LOVELY PACK ARE SIDE GOING TO IF YOU GO HIGH ON THE BLUE 
A LITTLE BIT CARELESS FOR ME HE 
NOT ONLY HAS TO POT THIS HE NEEDS A 
GOOD ANGLE ON THE BLACK 
HE HAS GOT TO PLAY THIS DONE TO GET 
BY THE RED HE'S STILL IN CONTROL 
THE STUN HE HAS GOT A NICE ANGLE 
DON'T MISS THE BLACK 
TURN 
YOUR EAR PIECES DOWN WE CAN HEAR 
THEM ON THE FLOOR 
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT ALI 
COULD HERE AND HIPPIES BACK IN 
YOUR PIECE WITH THE BLACK OFF ITS 
SPOT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIRE AT 
WILL 
IF HE PLAYED THIS ONE HUNDRED TIMES HE 
WOULD POT IT NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
HE IS OBVIOUSLY FEELING IT A LITTLE 
BIT OUT THERE AND YOU CANNOT BLAME 
HIM AWESOME AND IS IN FORM 
LOST HIS CHALK RONNIE IT WENT 
RIGHT UNDER THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE 
THERE 
LONG BLUE A LONG GREEN GREEN IS 
FAVOURED BECAUSE IT IS NEAREST THE 
POCKET 
IF HE DOES NOT KNOCK IT IN POCKET ALI CARTER WILL GET ANOTHER CHANCE 
TO REDEEM HIMSELF IN THIS FRAME BUT HE HAS MISSED IT 
SO ALI HERE IS YOUR CHANCE THE 
FOURTH ONE 
HE HAS JUST GONE 
BETWIXT AND BETWEEN THINGS ARE NOT 
GOING RIGHT FOR ALI AT THE MINUTE 
THESE ARE PRECIOUS SHOT THESE 
ARE PRESSURE SHOTS 
IT WAS A LOT EASIER PLAYING THE 
STUN SHOT IT WAS PURELY PRESSURE 
HE HAS GOT TO HOLD UNTIL TO GO 
THERE AND TRY TO GET OUT OF THIS 
SESSION NO MORE THAN FIVE TO THREE 
RONNIE RIGHT BACK INTO THE FRAME 
NOW BUT HE HAS A LITTLE BIT TO DO 
WITH THE CUE BALL HERE 
THIS IS NOT THE BEST SHOT HE HAS 
EVER PLAYED POINTS ARE LEVEL 
THE ONLY SLIGHT PROBLEM YOU CAN SEE 
IS THAT THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO BE 
TRAVELLING AROUND THE TABLE LITTLE BIT 
A COUPLE OF GOOD POSITIONAL SHOT 
THAN THE IT A COUPLE OF GOOD 
POSITIONAL SHOTS STILL NEEDED 
PLAYED FOR THE BROWN AS CLOSE AS 
POSSIBLE TO THE RED THE KEY IN 
THIS MATCH IS WHEN YOU GET IN YOU 
HAVE GOT TO SCORE ON TOURNAMENT 
ALONE FORTY ONE BREAKS OVER FIFTY RONNIE 
HAS MADE EVERY TIME RONNIE IT IN 
HE IS ALMOST WINNING THE FRAME AT 
ONE VISIT ALI IS NOT THAT HAS 
BEEN THE CASE TODAY 
THOSE FIGURES 
DO NOT INCLUDE TODAY AS IT NEEDED 
A GOOD POSITIONAL SHOT HE COULD 
NOT HAVE PLAYED ONE BETTER 
YELLOW TO GREEN THAT IS NO PROBLEM 
BECAUSE GREEN WILL BE FRAME BALL HE IS O. K. THE GAP IS NOT THERE 
YOU'RE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF ALI 
CARTER THAT THERE IS NO GAP 
HE HAS NOT HIT THE OTHER THIS 
COULD BE A FREE BALL IT IS NOT NOW 
HERE IS A DECISION YOU HAVE IT 
REPLACED 
WOULD BE PLAY WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WE DID YOU 
AT THINK I WOULD REPLACE L. THINK 
IT WAS YESTERDAY AND HE WAS NOT 
GOING THROUGH A SPELL HE IS GOING 
THROUGH NOW WHEN HE IS NOT 
COMPETENT HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN ONE ON 
MAYBE L. EXPECT RONNIE TO HIT ON THIS BUT YOU NEED SOME LUCK AS TO 
WHETHER YOU CAN KNOCK IT SAFE 
HERE IS WHERE IT WAS WHERE IS IT 
NOW L. DON'T THINK IT MAKES ANY 
DIFFERENCE TO THE SHOT RONNIE IS 
SAYING IT NEEDS TO COME TO WORK 
THIS TOUCH TOWARDS US AT WATCH 
KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE TABLE WERE 
IN REFEREE 
DEJA VU ANOTHER SEVEN POINTS HE 
WOULD DEFINITELY GO BACK 
HE HIT HE DID EXACTLY AT THAT PACE 
AND IT HAS COME BACK EXACTLY THIS 
IN AMAZING MAYBE HE 
IN AMAZING PUTTING OF SIDE ON IT 
IF HE PLAYS 
AT A FRACTION SLOWER THE SIDE WILL 
TAKE AND HIT IT 
THAT WAS TRY NUMBER THREE THIS IS 
REMARKABLE ISN'T IT IT IS 
REMARKABLE WHEN RONNIE SNOOKERED 
HIMSELF ON THE YELLOW YOU JUST 
THOUGHT WELL HE IS GOING TO HIT 
THE YELLOW AND HOPEFULLY GET IT 
SAFE BUT NOW THE POINTS ARE LEVEL 
EIGHTEEN POINTS HE'S GIVEN AWAY 
THE TWO CUSHION ESCAPE THIS TIME 
HE DID GET CLOSER BUT NOT ENOUGH 
THIS HAS THE MOST HE HAS GIVEN AWAY 
ALL TOURNAMENT THIS IS THE MOST 
HE HAS GIVEN WAY 
THIS FREE BALL 
MAY INTEREST ALI 
HE WILL LOOK AT THE BLACK HE HAS 
LOOKED AT THE PINK HE IS LOOKING 
AT THE GREEN IT IS A DECISION AND 
IT IS A BIG ONE BECAUSE RONNIE HAS 
NOT GETTING CLOSE TO THIS ESCAPE 
FROM THE SNOOKER 
THE EASY OPTION IS TO HAVE IT 
REPLACED L. DON'T BLAME HIM 
YOU S. 
HE IS NOT CONFIDENT THOUGH IT IS 
HE IF IT WAS RONNIE HE WOULD HAVE 
PLAYED THE PINK BUT HE IS FOUR TO ONE IN 
FRONT AND COASTING L. DON'T BLAME 
THEM AT ALL 
ABSOLUTELY I DON'T 
BLAME HIM AT ALL 
HE HAS HIT IT NOT A DISSIMILAR 
YELLOW TO THE ONE THAT ALI REFUSED 
TO PLAY BUT IN THE MEANTIME HE 
HAS ACCUMULATED TWENTY TWO POINTS IN FOULS 
AND NOW FINDS HIMSELF FOUR POINTS IN 
FRONT HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL HERE 
EVERY TIME ALI COMES TO THE TABLE 
AT THE MINUTE HE HAS TO DO THINGS 
WITH THE CUE BALL THAT IS WHAT 
MAKES THINGS SO FRUSTRATING WHEN 
YOU ARE ON FORM AND EVERYTHING IS 
COMING GOOD EVERYTHING IS NICE AND 
EASY YOU ARE PERFECT THERE HE 
HAS NO SHOT BUT TO PLAY THE HOLE 
HE'S JUST GOING THROUGH ONE OF THEM 
SPELLS 
YES I THINK THAT 
IS WHAT SPELLS IS THE BOTTOM LINE HE SHOULD HAVE 
POTTED IT THIS IS THE LONGEST 
FRAME OF THE MATCH 
JUST ABOUT ON THE GREEN BUT IT IS 
A THIN POTTING ANGLE IT IS A TOUGH 
SHOT TO GET GOOD POSITION ON THE 
BROWN IT IS ALL ABOUT THE CUE BALL 
HE HAS MISSED THE BLUE HAS HE 
MISSED THE PINK NOT QUITE 
ONE POINT IN FRONT HE NEEDS BROWN 
BLUE AND PINK 
SO ALI CARTER GETS ANOTHER CHANCE 
WHEN 
HE COULD HEAR YOU THROUGH THE 
EARPIECE THERE HE PLAYED THE POT 
THERE HE IS NOT HITTING THE BALL 
AT THE MOMENT AT ALL BUT HE HAS 
SECOND PRIZE 
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT AS LONG AS HE 
GOT IT SOMEWHERE NEAR FULL BALL HE 
HAD EVERY CHANCE OF PUTTING IT 
SOMEWHERE NEAR THE BLACK THE 
SNOOKER IS A BONUS 
I DON'T THINK 
HE HAS WHETHER HE CAN HIT ENOUGH 
OF THE BROWN TO POT IT OR NOT THAT 
IS ANOTHER MATTER 
HE COULD HIT ENOUGH OF THE BROWN A 
GOOD POT HE NEEDS ANOTHER ONE ON 
THE BLUE 
WELL HE HAS HAD MORE CHANCES IN 
THIS FRAME THAN THE WHOLE MATCH SO 
FAR THIS IS JUST WHAT YOU NEED FOR 
FRAME BALL A STRAIGHTFORWARD SHOT 
THIS IS A FRAME ALI CARTER SHOULD 
HAVE LOST THIS COULD GIVE HIM THE 
CONFIDENCE HE NEEDS 
HE HAS KEPT HIMSELF IN THE SESSION 
HE STILL TRAILS BY FOUR TO TWO 
YEAR US VERY IMPORTANT TO ALI 
CARTER EVERY CRUCIBLE FINAL IS 
GREAT OCCASION THERE IS RONNIE'S 
PARTNER THERE ARE HIS CHILDREN 
JUST WATCHING DAD GOING ABOUT HIS 
BUSINESS HIS DAUGHTER LILY WAS 
BIT OF A STAR AT TELFORD SHE 
DANCED ON THE MATCH TABLE 
IN THE FINAL ONCE AGAIN THERE WE 
ARE HAPPY FAMILIES LOVELY TO SEE 
I KNOW THAT ALI CARTER'S GIRLFRIEND 
AND DAD ARE HERE BUT TERRY 
GRIFFITHS SAID NOT TO BRING A BUS 
LOAD BECAUSE IT IS NOT A 
CELEBRATION IT IS MATCH HOW 
MUCH CAN IT AFFECT THE EQUILIBRIUM 
OF NOT BY NOT HAVING A FAMILY 
AROUND 
IT DEPENDS IT IS O. K. IF AROUND THEY COME TO WATCH BUT IF IT 
DISRUPTS YOUR NORMAL FLOW OF THINGS 
HOW YOU HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGHOUT 
THE TOURNAMENT YOU ARE NOT HERE TO 
SOCIALISE THAT IS DIFFERENT YOU 
KNOW YOU NEED TO KEEP THEM AT ARM'S 
DISTANCE L. KNOW THAT SOUNDS STRANGE BUT IT 
DEPENDS WHO 
YOU 
DECIDE TO SAY HELLO TO 
EACH TO 
THEIR OWN ALI CARTER'S MIND IS 
FIRMLY ON THIS FINAL 
WE ARE ALL AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMING 
THAT RONNIE IS GOING TO PLAY AT THE 
SAME SUPERB LEVEL HE PLAYED IN THE 
SEMI FINAL HE IS THE SAME AS 
EVERYONE ELSE HE IS STILL PLAYING 
GOOD AT THE MOMENT BUT HE WAS 
PERFECT IN THE SEMI FINAL 
DO YES 
AND IT IS VERY HARD TO IMPROVE ON 
PERFECTION YES BACK TO THE 
MATCH WE GO 
YES THAT IS A FAIR POINT 
WE CANNOT ALWAYS PLAY THIS GAME 
PERFECTLY YOU CANNOT DO THAT WITH 
ANY BALL GAME AT THIS LEVEL TO 
CATCH A BAULK COLOUR FULL IN THE 
FACE IS A DANGEROUS THING LEAVING 
THE CUE BALL ON THE BAULK LINE HE HE HAS GOT TO DO A LITTLE BIT WITH THE 
CUE BALL 
THERE IS THE SHOT AND THERE IS THE 
KISS MAGNIFICENT THAT IS WHEN YOU 
ARE FEELING VERY VERY CONFIDENT L. L. 
THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT HE CAUGHT IT 
TOO THIN THE KISS ON THE SECOND 
RED SLOWED THE CUE BALL DOWN AN 
EXCELLENT SHOT WHEN YOU SET UP A 
SHOT LIKE THAT YOU DESERVE WHAT 
YOU GET AND IT COULD BE PLENTY 
WE DID NOT GET THE REACTION WE 
NORMALLY SEE FROM RONNIE THERE 
RONNIE'S BREAK BUILDING ARE SO GOOD 
HE'S IS SO GOOD THAT WAS NOT THE BEST 
KISS MAMMON NOW ALL THEN IF 
YOU CAN GET THIS FROM YOU WILL BE 
DELIGHTED FRAME 
NORMALLY WHEN 
YOU MISS WHEN YOU ARE IN LIKE THAT 
YOU DID YOUR OPPONENT SOMETHING 
EASY TO GO OUT BUT THAT IS NOT THE 
CASE HERE TO GO AT A GOOD SAFETY 
HE HAS HAD A QUICK LOOK AT THE TWO 
BALL PLANT HE IS JUST WONDERING 
WHETHER HE CAN PLAY THE RUN THROUGH 
OF 
THE RED TO THE RIGHT 
OF AND 
LEAVE THE 
CUE BALL 
DOWN THIS 
END THAT 
PLANT COULD 
THEN BE MADE 
THIS IS NOT STRAIGHT FORWARD SHOT 
A THIN ONE WAS NEEDED A THIN ONE 
WAS GOT AN EXCELLENT SAFETY SHOT 
IF HE MISSES THE YELLOW WHICH HE 
HAS DONE A GOOD SHOT THERE IS A 
POSSIBILITY OF THIS RED TO THE LEFT 
CORNER BUT IT IS SO CLOSE TO THE 
BAULK CUSHION IT IS NOT CERTAIN 
HE COULD GO ROUND THE BACK OF THE 
BLACK HE COULD NOT WHERE IS THE 
BLACK WELL IT WAS A DANGEROUS 
SHOT TO TAKE ON BUT HE KNOCKED IT 
IN 
IT WAS NOT A SHOT FOR NOTHING THE 
PINK WILL NOT GO TO THE LEFT MIDDLE 
IF RONNIE WAS NOT HAMPERED BY THE 
TWO REDS IT WOULD BE EASIER HE 
DOES NOT FANCY THE LONG BLUE HE IS 
LOOKING AT THE SAFETY HE HAS TO BE 
CAREFUL IF HE PLAYS THE BLACK IN 
BEHIND THE BROWN BECAUSE THAT WOULD 
BE VERGE TO THE POTTING ANGLE OF 
THE BLACK THAT WOULD BE THE 
POTTING ANGLE OF THE BLACK BOTH 
PLAYERS ARE REALISING HOW IMPORTANT 
THIS SESSION IS AN EXCELLENT 
SAFETY SHOT FROM O'SULLIVAN 
HE DID NOT GET THE DESIRED THIN US 
FINNAN MESS HE DID NOT GET THE DESIRED THIN SHOT 
ANOTHER GOOD SAFETY GOOD LINE 
GOOD LENGTH ALI NEEDS A GOOD ONE 
HERE TO NOT LEAVE RONNIE A POT ON 
HE HAS TO CATCH THIS JUST RIGHT HE NEEDS A KISS ON SOMETHING TO 
STOP THAT CUE BALL AND HE HAS NOT 
HAS HE LEFT THIS RED TO THE LEFT 
CORNER MAYBE NOT 
FINN WITH THAT THEIR SAFETY FINN 
WITH THAT SAFETY THINNER IT IS 
A DANGEROUS SHOT TO TAKE ON 
HE JUST CANNOT GET TO SEE ENOUGH OF 
THIS RED TO THE LEFT CORNER IT IS 
THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF 
THE TABLE IF HE TAKES THE POT ON 
HE NEEDS TO GET IT 
HE NEEDED TO GET BACK THAT WELL WELL ABSOLUTELY FIRST CLASS HAVING A 
BIT OF A TOUGH SESSION OUT THERE AT 
THE MOMENT HE PINCHED THE FREAK 
PREVIOUS FRAME THAT WAS GOOD 
SHOT HE WAS THIRTY THREE BEHIND CAN HE GET 
RIGHT BACK INTO THIS FRAME NOW 
WHEN THE PINK GOES BACK ON ITS SPOT 
IT WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE INTO ONE 
POCKET 
HE NEEDED TO MISS THE PINK POCKET HE JUST DRIFTED PAST THE PINK HE 
HAS A CHOICE OF REDS BUT IT IS 
JUST THAT THE PINK IS NOW OUT OF 
COMMISSION 
YES AND HE MAY BE COMMISSION FORCED TO GO FOR THE BLACK NOW HE 
DOES NOT HAVE TO DO IT 
OFF THIS 
RED 
HE 
CAN DO 
IT 
OFF THE 
NEXT ONE 
FEELS GOING FOR THE BLUE IS EASIER 
HE IS ON THE BLUE THIS NEXT SHOT 
IS KEY IF HE DOESN'T GET THE BLACK 
OFF THE NEXT RED HE WILL FIND THIS 
HARD WORK 
HE COULD NEVER IT REALLY GET THE 
RIGHT ANGLE ON THE BLUE HE COULD 
NEVER REALLY HE NEEDS GOOD SHOT HERE 
HER IS HE ON THIS RED TO THE LEFT 
CORNER NO 
YOU CAN SEE THAT IS WHY 
IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO TRY WHEN 
HE HAD THE CHANCE TO GET TOP SIDE 
OF THE BLUE WHICH HE DID HE COULD 
HAVE PLAYED 
IT 
WITH A 
BIT MORE 
AND GONE UP FOR THE BLACK NONE OF 
THIS WOULD 
BE A PROBLEM THAT 
WHY HE HAS RUN OUT OF POSITION NOW 
THIS WAS THE ONE WAY HE COULD HAVE 
POSSIBLY PLAYED TWICE ACROSS FOR 
THE BLACK BUT ONCE AGAIN ONCE YOU 
DON'T GET TOP SIDE OF THE BLUE 
THAT IS WHEN YOU START HAVING 
PROBLEMS NOT A BAD SAFETY BUT I 
DON'T THINK THERE'S A POT ON 
RONNIE IS COMING ROUND TO SEE IF HE 
CAN SEE ANYTHING ELSE HE CANNOT 
I AM AMAZED HE PLAYED IT LIKE THAT 
HE PLAYED TO MISS THE DOUBLE KISS 
AND IT WAS ON THE CUSHION 
YES HE 
HAS NOT PLAYED MANY LOOSE SAFETY IS 
BUT THAT WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF THEM 
SAFETIES 
IF HE HAD NOT THAT IN THAT WAS A 
REALLY GOOD CHANCE SO NEAR AND 
YET SO FAR 
A GOOD POT JUST A SLIGHT ANGLE ON 
THE BLUE HE HAS A SIXTEEN POINT LEAD 
RONNIE AND IT IS VERY USEFUL HE 
IS ONLY JUST OFF STRAIGHT HE MAY 
BE ABLE TO FORCE AN ANGLE HE DID PRETTY WELL 
THIS ALL DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE 
PINK IS IN PLAY IF IT IS IN PLAY 
HE WILL NOT PLAY THE CANNON IF HE 
FEELS HE NEEDS TO BRING THE PINK 
HE WILL PLAY A CANNON 
INTO PLAY HE WILL PLAY A CANNON HERE 
YES HE FEELS IT IS O. K. TO PLAY ON 
THE LOOSE RED HE IS TWENTY SEVEN POINTS IN 
FRONT SO FOUR REDS ARE NEEDED 
RONNIE IS SLIGHTLY OUT OF POSITION 
HERE 
BOY HAS HE HAD TO WORK HARD HE 
HAS HAD A 
RESULT HERE WHAT RESULT GETTING THAT REDS SAFE THAT 
WAS VERY FORTUNATE THAT RED SAFE 
JUST SHOWS YOU AT PACE IF YOU ARE 
JUST OFF LINE THEY DO NOT GOING 
HE IS STUCK ON THE PINK 
ALI CARTER WILL BE GLAD THAT RONNIE 
MISSED THE RED AND HE IS STILL IN 
THE FRAME 
THIS IS JUST ABOUT THE SHAKIEST 
HALF AN HOUR AS RONNIE HAS HAD IN 
THE TOURNAMENT IF HE DOESN'T GET 
BACK INTO THE SESSION HE WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED 
ALI CARTER HAS GOT RONNIE 
STRUGGLING AT THE MOMENT THAT IS EXCELLENT VERY WELL PLAYED 
YES THE RED THAT RONNIE DID NOT 
REALLY WANT TO MOVE IS ON THE TOP 
CUSHION 
THAT WILL DO IT THAT IS ANOTHER 
EXCELLENT SAFETY SHOT 
YES HE HAS GOT SOME MANOEUVRES IN 
THE TACTICAL SIDE OF THE GAME IT 
IS NOT ALL ABOUT POTTING AND BREAK 
BUILDING WITH RONNIE THAT WAS A 
TERRIFIC SHOT THE PRESSURE IS BACK 
ON ALI 
WELL HE NEEDS TO COVER THIS RED TO 
THE RIGHT CORNER WITH THE YELLOW 
AND HE HAS DONE IT A GREAT SHOT 
IS THERE AN ANGLE FOR ALI TO PLAY 
THE SHOT TO NOTHING DON'T THINK 
SO THERE IS A WAY OF GETTING IN 
BEHIND THE GREEN AND BROWN BUT HE 
WOULD BE ON THE ONE THAT IS BEHIND THE BLACK 
AND HE 
WILL HAVE 
TO SWING IT OFF THREE CUSHIONS 
THAT IS DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY BEING 
SO FAR AWAY FROM IT 
I THINK HE PROBABLY DID RISK THE 
CUT NOT TOO BAD THERE IS A POT ON 
FOR RONNIE BUT NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD 
AND THAT ONE HE DID NOT COVER THAT 
IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT FRACTIONS 
A GOOD LONG POT RONNIE JUST HAVING 
A LOOK AT THE SITUATION HE IS THIRTY NINE 
POINTS IN FRONT ANYTHING LESS THAN 
THE BLUE HE WILL NEED ANOTHER RED 
SO PLAYING A SAFETY IN WHICH HE 
PLAYS A SNOOKER AND HE PUTS THE 
YELLOW IN A SAFE POSITION 
RUTHLESS 
HE HAS MADE A GOOD JOB OF IT BUT 
HE IS JUST SHORT OF PACE YOU WOULD 
NOT HAVE FANCIED RONNIE FROM 
POTTING ONE OF THESE WORDS YOU 
WOULD NOT HAVE FANCIED RONNIE POT 
IN ONE OF THESE REDS BUT HE GET 
THIS IT IS FRAME BALL USED ALL POCKET BUT IT WENT IN 
BASICALLY THREE SNOOKERS REQUIRED 
HE THINKS THE TASK IS TO BREAK IT 
WAS A FRAME THAT COULD HAVE GONE 
EITHER WAY BUT THIS TIME IT WENT 
TO RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HE EXTENDS 
HIS LEAD TO FIVE TO TWO 
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE 
OPPORTUNITIES TO WIN FRAMES IN ONE 
VISIT LOOKING BACK LOOKING BACK 
TO WHEN ALI HAD A CHANCE IN THAT 
FRAME AND OBVIOUSLY IT WAS NOT A 
PERFECT POSITION BECAUSE THE BLACK 
WAS ON THE BAULK YOU SUGGESTED IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO PLAY 
FOR THE BLACK 
THE PREVIOUS SHOT AT THOUGHT HE 
WOULD HAVE PLAYED FOR THE BLACK 
THE PROBLEM WITH PLAYING ON THE 
BLUE IF YOU DO NOT GET TOP SIDE OF 
IT HE COULD HAVE TAKEN THE RISK 
OF PLAYING FOR BLACK OR THEN OR 
BAULK CORNER BAK CHOIR 
HE DID NOT FEEL AS THOUGH HE COULD 
GET THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BLUE 
WITHOUT LEAVING THE CUE BALL TIGHT 
AGAINST THE CUSHION HE PUT IT WAS 
TOO EASY TO PLAY FOR THE BLACK HE 
RAN AT A POSITION 
THE 
FINAL FRAME WHEN RECESSION ALI 
CARTER TO BREAK IN THIS SESSION 
ALI IS FIVE TWO BEHIND AND HAS NOT 
MADE A BREAK OVER THIRTY SINCE HE MADE 
ONE RUN OF AND FOUR IN FRAME FOUR 
ONE HUNDRED FOUR ALREADY THIS IS A KEY FRAME 
AT FIVE TO THREE HE WOULD BE 
PLEASED WE KNOW ALI HAS NOT PLAYED 
ANYWHERE NEAR HIS BEST 
HE HAS GOT A GOOD CUE BALL AND HE 
CANNOT GET THROUGH TO THE RED 
RONNIE 
THAT WAS BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED 
ABSOLUTELY INCH PERFECT ANY 
THINNER AND HE MAY HAVE GOT THE 
DOUBLE KISS HE KNEW BY PLAYING OF 
SAKE OF THAT RED HE WAS NOT GOING 
TO LEAVE IT SAFE OFF THAT RED 
STEPHEN HENDRY FOUND OUT HOW GOOD 
HIS ALL ROUND GAME WAS WON THE 
SEMI FINAL IT IS HARD TO FORCE HIM 
INTO HER MISTAKE INS IF HE IN SIT 
IT TO END HIS IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
FORCE HIM INTO A MISTAKE IN SAFETY 
MISSED BY A LONG WAY THAT HAS NOT 
LEFT ANYTHING EASY FOR RONNIE THAT WAS A GREAT SHOT YOU DREAM OF KISSES LIKE THAT 
HE WOULD LIKE TO GET TO THE REDS IN 
SO THE BLACK WORST THERE YOU GO 
TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN 
DEBATABLE WHETHER REPLAYED INTO THE 
BLACK HE PLAYED ALWAYS TRYING 
TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN ALL WAS 
LOOKING FOR THE SHOT OR FRAME WINNING OPPORTUNITY 
AN EXPECTED FLICK OFF THE BLACK AND 
I DO NOT THINK HE IS ON ANYTHING IT 
UNEXPECTED JUST THE LAST FEW 
FRAMES RONNIE IS GETTING IN AND 
DID NOT MAKING THE MOST OF IT 
WE'RE NOT USED TO SEEING THIS 
I THINK WE HAVE SEEN MORE SAFETY IN 
THIS SESSION AND WE SAW IN THE 
WHOLE MATCH AGAINST STEPHEN HENDRY 
EVERY GAME IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT TO 
THE OTHER ALI HAS BEEN COMPETING 
WITH THE SAFETY BUT HE JUST SEEMS 
TO KEEP FLICKING OF THE BAULK 
COLOURS IT IS FRACTIONS 
THE LAST THING RONNIE NEEDS IS ALL 
LOCK ALL OF THE LOCH 
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE NATURE OF 
THE GAME WHEN YOU DO NOT GET IT 
GET IT WE DON'T NEED IT BUT CHANCE 
THAT IS WHAT WILL HURT ALI IF HE 
GOES ON TO USE THIS TO LOSE THIS 
FRAME HE HAS NOT PLAYED WELL IN 
THIS SESSION THERE IS A 
POSSIBILITY IT WILL BE SIX TO TWO HE 
PLAYED WELL AND THE OPENING THREE 
FRAMES BUT SINCE THEN HE HAS BEEN 
GIVEN RONNIE LOT OF CHANCES 
IF HE COULD JUST SAT UP ALI AND 
GET MORE CONFIDENT HE COULD JUST 
GET BACK INTO THIS PART HE COULD 
DO WITH WINNING THIS FRAME INTO 
THIS MATCH NOT THE BEST POSITIONAL SHOT A BIT TO DO WITH THE CUE BALL 
MADE IT LOOK VERY EASY BLUE RYTON 
THE HEART OF THE POCKET PERFECT ON 
THE NEXT RED REICH AND THE HEART 
OF THE POCKET 
IN A GOOD POSITION HERE TO SCORE 
HEAVILY IT COULD BE TELLING FLUKE 
HE WILL HAVE TO PLAY THIS WITH A 
LITTLE BIT OF SIDE TO MAKE SURE IT 
DOES NOT ENTER THE REDS ON THE WAY 
BACK 
IT HAS NOT BEEN VINTAGE O'SULLIVAN 
THIS AFTERNOON SALE STILL 
FAVOURITE TO GO SIX TO TWO IN FRONT 
THAT IS TERRIFIC POTTING SUCCESS 
HE WOULD NOT CALL IS INCH PERFECT 
CONTROL OF THE CUE BALL AT THE 
MOMENT PRETTY GOOD RECOVERY IT IS AMAZING 
MOST PLAYERS WOULD HAVE PLAYED THE 
CANNON ON THE TWO REDS RONNIE BEEN 
A VERY PROFICIENT LEFT AND PLAYER 
DECIDED TO PLAY FOR THE RED 
WINNER OF THE BOTTOM RED OF THE TWO 
PARTS HE MAY BE BIGOT THEY HAVE 
BEEN SCREWING THE BLACK IN THE 
MIDDLE ME KNOW AT 
OF ASTHMA IF HE GETS ON THAT RED I 
THINK IT WOULD BE THE END OF THE 
FRAME IF HE GETS ON THAT FRAME 
THAT DOES HAVE A LOOK AT THE 
SCOREBOARD THERE IS A POSSIBLE SIXTY SEVEN 
LEFT ON THE TABLE ONCE AGAIN A BIT OF WORK TO DO 
HE IS JUST ABOUT ON THIS RED ALONG 
TOP CUSHION A LITTLE BIT TRICKY 
THIS RED AND THE BLUE WOULD PUT HIM 
FIFTY NINE POINTS IN FRONT 
BLUE MAKES HIM SIXTY WITH FIFTY NINE ON THE 
BOARD 
HE MISSED IT ANYWAY HE NEVER REALLY HAD GOOD CONTROL OF 
THE CUE BALL EVENTUALLY IT FOUND 
HIM OUT ALI CARTER STILL WITH 
CHANCE IN THIS FRAME FIFTY FIVE BEHIND FIFTY NINE 
REMAINING THE FIRST PRIORITY GET 
A GOOD SAFETY AND THAT IS NOT IT 
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS PLAYING 
THERE DID NOT CUE THAT AT ALL WELL 
IT HAS NOT BEEN THE FIRE WORKS 
THIS FIRST SESSION YOU CANNOT 
EXPECT IT ALL THE TIME RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY 
BRILLIANT AT HIS LAST SEVENTEEN DAYS HE 
IS ENTITLED TO PLAY A SESSION 
SLIGHTLY NOT AS GOOD AS NORMAL BUT 
ALI CARTER WILL BE DISAPPOINTED 
BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE RONNIE WAS 
THERE FOR THE TAKING THIS AFTERNOON 
HE HAS STILL WON THE SESSION SIX TO TWO 
THAT WILL HURT ALI WERE THAN 
ANYTHING BUT HE IS GOOD ENOUGH TO 
GET BACK INTO IT HAVE NOT PASS 
BACK HAVEN'T WE SEE SOME HAVEN'T 
WE SEEN SOME COMEBACKS AT THE 
CRUCIBLE BEFORE NO BREAK OVER FIFTY 
AND THE LAST FOUR FRAMES OF THIS 
SESSION BUT ALI CARTER KNOWS HE 
HAS A MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB ALREADY 
WITH HIGH BREAK OF NINETY NINE RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN TAKES THE SESSION BY SIX TO TWO 
HE HAS NOT EXACTLY HIT TOP GEAR YET 
BUT THAT IS AN EMPHATIC SCORE LINE 
AFTER THE OPENING SESSION HE IS 
THE EIGHT TO ONE ON FAVOURITE TO WIN THIS 
FINAL AND CLAIMED A THIRD WORLD 
TITLE ALI CARTER HAS IT ALL TO DO 
LET US GET THE VIEW OF THE BOYS IN 
THE STUDIO WHAT ARE DUE MAKE OF 
THE OPENING EIGHT FRAMES OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY HE HAS NOT SCALED THE HEIGHTS HE 
DID IN THE SEMI FINAL THAT IS 
PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE HE WAS 
THAT NEAR TO PERFECTION AS YOU CAN 
GET WHAT THAT MATCH AGAINST STEPHEN 
HENDRY IN SPORTING EVENTS YOU HAVE 
TO GO BACK TO THE WELL THE 
FOLLOWING DAY AND YOU MIGHT NOT ME 
UP TO THE SAME STANDARD HIS 
STANDARD AT THE MOMENT IS BEGIN 
BUT IS STILL SUPERIOR TO OTHER 
PEOPLE'S THE GAMES 
WHERE IS ALI 
HE HAS BEEN A BIT 
STIFLED THE DAY IT ALL STARTED 
POSSIBLY IN FRAME ONE WITH THE 
MISCUE HE GOT OFF TO A POOR START 
HE WAS ON THE BACK FOOT TO SOME 
DEGREE AS JOHN SAID IF YOU WERE 
TALKING ABOUT EXCELLENCE OBVIOUSLY 
WE KNOW RONNIE O'SULLIVAN'S 
EXCELLENCE IS UNSURPASSABLE BUT 
HIS POOREST STANDARD IS ALSO BETTER 
THAN MOST HIS AVERAGE STANDARD IS 
A LOT BETTER THAN MOST PEOPLE'S 
AVERAGE IT HAS BEEN A BREAD AND 
BUTTER PERFORMANCE AND PROBABLY THE 
HIGHLIGHT HAS BEEN SOME EXCELLENT 
SAFETY PLAY APART FROM THE 
OCCASIONAL BRILLIANT SHOT AND THE 
FACT HE PLAYS LEFT HANDED WHEN 
EVERY FEELS LIKE IT HIS POSITIONAL 
PLAY HAS BEEN BRILLIANT WITH 
SAFETY PLAY HE HAS NOT REALLY GIVEN 
ALI CARTER MANY CHANCES FOR ALI 
CARTER TO GET BACK INTO THIS HE 
HAS TO FORCE HIS WAY BACK IN THAT 
PUTS PRESSURE ON HIS POTTING 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ADRENALIN 
HOW LONG YOU CAN ACTUALLY RELY ON 
THAT ALI CARTER HAS HAD TOUGH 
WAY TO THE SEMI FINAL BACK TO THE 
FINAL A TOUGH MATCH LAST NIGHT 
HOW LONG CAN HE KEEP GOING WHEN HE 
BECOMES FURTHER BEHIND YEAR KING 
THAT IS THE QUESTION 
IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO 
PLAYERS IT IS NOT EASY TO KEEP 
THINGS GOING IF HE CAN SEE SOMEONE 
SAILING AWAY IN THE DISTANCE YOU 
CAN GET TIRED 
IT WOULD BE DOUBTFUL IF YOU GOT OFF 
TO A GOOD START IN THE FINAL THAT 
HE WOULD SUFFER TIREDNESS BECAUSE 
YOU'RE LACKING A TURN AROUND YOU 
WOULD BE BUZZING 
THE FURTHER YOU GO BEHIND THE 
HARDER IT IS ON EVERYTHING YOU'RE 
BEING ASKED MORE QUESTIONS IF YOU 
LOSE TOUCH WITH THE PLAYER AS HAS 
SOMETIMES HAPPENED IT IS VERY HARD 
NOT TO DROP YOUR HEAD 
LET US SEE 
WHETHER ALI THE GROUP'S THAT WILL 
BE LATER IN THE EVENING BUT THESE 
TWO PLAYERS HAVE GIVEN US SOME 
WONDERFUL MOMENTS BOTH HAVE NOT 
BEEN A MAXIMUM BREAK ON MONDAY 
THEY HAVE MADE HISTORY THERE HAVE 
NEVER BEEN A THERE HAVE NEVER 
BEEN TWO MADE IN THE SAME YEAR IT 
COMES TWENTY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ONE 
BY THE GRINDER HE IS AN HONOUR TO 
BE A PROFESSIONAL IN THE ERA I WAS 
IN IT WAS AN HONOUR TO PLAY AT THE 
CRUCIBLE IT WAS AN HONOUR TO SCORE 
THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN IT SEEMS TO MAKE 
MEAN A LOT MORE EVERY TIME I'M 
BREATHING 
IT WAS BIG NEWS BREATHING EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT IT 
THERE ARE MOMENTS AT THE CRUCIBLE 
THAT PEOPLE REMEMBER AND THAT IS 
ONE OF THEM 
THE CRUCIBLE A SPORTING 
ACHIEVEMENTS GO MY ACHIEVEMENT WAS 
COMPARED TO CLIMBING EVEREST THE 
FOUR MINUTE MILE THE NINE DART 
CHECKOUT FIFTEEN REDS FIFTEEN BLACKS AND 
ALL THE COLOURS THANK GOD FOR 
VIDEOTAPE 
I DO NOT FEEL BAD ABOUT FOOD IN THE 
FIRST BALL FOOD IN THE FIRST 
BALL 
IT WAS DISAPPOINTING FOR ME I BALL DID NOT GET THE CHANCE CLIFF WAS 
GLAD TO GET IT IN LET'S HAVE A GO 
AT THE BLACK 
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING 
WE WANTED TO HAPPEN WE WANTED TO 
SEE IT JOHN SPENCER HAD MADE ONE 
IN A TOURNAMENT IN SLOUGH 
UNFORTUNATELY THE CAMERA CREW WAS 
ON A LUNCH BREAK SO IT HAS EVER 
SEEN 
THERE IS THE THING THAT WAS SEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO EVERYBODY AT THE 
B. B. C. CREW STEVE HAD DONE ONE FOR 
I. T. V. THE YEAR BEFORE 
PEOPLE WERE 
MAKING ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN IN PRACTICE VERY RARELY 
MADE IN EXHIBITIONS AND UNHEARD OF 
IN TOURNAMENT PLAY IF YOU LOOK 
BACK AT THE TAPES IT IS IT WAS 
JUST AS GOOD AS THE ONE AT A BOARD 
A SEVEN YOU HAVE NOWADAYS ALBEIT A BIT 
SLOWER THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
I WAS SO ILL I DID NOT FEEL GOOD 
I SLEPT FOR AN HOUR THE NIGHT 
BEFORE I CAME DOWN WAS IN BAD 
SHAPE AT TO BLOW MY NOSE I HAD 
TO BLOW MY NOSE 
WHAT A MOMENT THIS IS IT IS TRULY 
ELECTRIC IF ONLY WE COULD TELL THE 
AUDIENCE NOT TO APPLAUD FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THIS BREAK 
HE IS A GREAT POSITIONAL PLAYER IT 
WAS ONLY UNTIL HE GOT TO THE EYE 
COULD SEE PROBLEMS 
THIS IS THE 
REAL SHOT THAT MATTERS 
THE PRESSURE WAS INTENSE I'LL 
NEVER FORGET THE SHOT THAT STICKS 
OUT AND PROBABLY EVERYBODY WILL 
WHEN HE POTTED THE ALLOWED TO GET 
ON THE GREEN HE PLAYED A STUN RUN 
THROUGH SHOT AND HE PLAYED IT 
PERFECTLY 
I FOR 
THE WAY HE CLEARED PERFECTLY THE COLOURS WAS UNBELIEVABLE AT THE OTHER WAY YOU SAW THE REACTION 
FROM THE CROWD AND OTHER PLAYERS 
IT WAS A MAGICAL MOMENT 
I AM SURE HE IS HOPING AND PRAYING 
THAT CLIFF THORBURN WILL DO THIS I I WAS SO EXCITED L. THINK EVERYBODY 
WAS IT HAD NEVER BEEN DONE IN THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS ONCE HE GOT 
THAT I KNEW HE WOULD GET IT 
THEY WON'T BE ANOTHER MOMENT IN 
CLIPS LIFE AS HE WENT WHEN HE 
WILL BE AS INTENSE 
I FELT GOOD PLAYING PHYSICALLY I 
WAS AWFUL BUT AT THE END WHEN I 
SHUT THE BLACK I JUST ONE OF THE 
MAKE SURE THE BLACK NEVER EVEN 
TOUCHED THE SIDES OF THE POCKET I I WOULD NEVER FORGET WHEN HE GOT DOWN 
TO POT THE BLACK THE COMMENTATOR 
MADE A GREAT GOOD LUCK MATE 
WONDERFUL THAT IS REALLY TRULY 
WONDERFUL 
THE WHOLE PLACE ERUPTED THE 
EMOTIONS OF EVERYBODY JUST BEING 
THERE AND SEEING IT WHAT MUST IT 
BE LIKE FOR A CLIFF IT WAS 
SOMETHING ELSE 
SOME YOUNG LAD ASKED ME FORMER OF A 
GRAPH BACKSTAGE L. COULD NOT EVEN 
SIGNED MY NAME L. WAS REALLY EXCITED 
TO PAY THE PERFECT FRAME TO MAKE 
THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN IT IS A MEMORY THAT 
WILL STAY WITH ME FOREVER 
WHAT A WONDERFUL FILM WONDERFUL 
MEMORIES IT GIVES YOU GO RESPONSE

CRUCIBLE CRUCIBLE THAT IS POSSIBLE L. PLAYED AN 
EXHIBITION WITH PETER EBDON HE

DRIVING SEAT BYE BYE
