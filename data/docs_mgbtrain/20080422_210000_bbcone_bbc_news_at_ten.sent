REPORT ON THE MISUSE OF EXPENSES 
OFFICIAL AUDITORS FIND EVIDENCE OF 
WIDESPREAD WRONGDOING ONE MEP SAYS 
THE DECISION TO KEEP IT SECRET IS 
VERY DAMAGING 
IF SOME CITIZENS 
ACROSS EUROPE TODAY THINK THERE ARE 
MORE HONEST PEOPLE TO BE FOUND IN A 
PRISON THAN IN THE EUROPEAN 
PARLIAMENT WELL I'D HAVE TO HAVE 
SYMPATHY FOR THAT VIEW 
WE'RE LIVE 
IN STRASBOURG WITH THE DETAILS 
ALSO TONIGHT BATTLEGROUND 
PENNSYLVANIA CLINTON MUST WIN 
AGAINST OBAMA IF SHE'S TO STAY IN 
THE PRESIDENTIAL RATE 
BRITAIN'S MORTGAGE LENDERS VISIT 
THE CHANCELLOR HE TELLS THEM PASS 
ON LOWER RATES TO CUSTOMERS 
THE MAN GIVEN A CRIMINAL RECORD FOR 
FAILING TO CLOSE HIS BIN 
AS LONG 
AS IT'S NEARLY CLOSED IS THAT O. K. 
THE LINE WE TAKE WITH RESIDENTS 
WHEN ISSUING ADVICE IS BIN LID 
CLOSED AND LIVERPOOL 
STRIKE FIRST 
AGAINST 
CHELSEA IN TONIGHT'S CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE LEAGUE ON B. B. C. LONDON LEADING POLITICIANS 
JOIN THE FAMILY OF STEPHEN LAWRENCE 
FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER HIS RACIST MURDER 
AND ACCUSED OF BREAKING ELECTION 
BROADCAST RULES THE T. V. SATELLITE 
STATION UNDER INVESTIGATION 
GOOD EVENING THE EUROPEAN 
PARLIAMENT HAS VOTED TO BAN THE 
PUBLICATION OF A SECRET REPORT INTO 
THE ALLOWANCES CLAIMED BY MEPS THE 
REPORT BY OFFICIAL AUDITORS 
CONTAINS WIDESPREAD EVIDENCE OF 
ABUSE IT INCLUDES PAYMENTS TO 
MEPS' RELATIVES AND ALLOWANCES 
BEING PAID TO PRIVATE COMPANIES 
THE REPORT WAS DELIVERED AS THE 
PARLIAMENT MAKES ONE OF ITS REGULAR 
MOVES FROM BRUSSELS TO STRASBOURG 
AS MARK MARDELL NOW REPORTS 
IS THIS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN A 
GRAVY TRAIN IS ON THE MOVE THERE'S 
A GROWING CAMPAIGN AMONG MEPS 
WORRIED ABOUT THEIR POOR IMAGE TO 
STOP THIS THE FRANTIC WEEK IN THE 
MONTH WHEN THEY HAVE TO PACK UP AND 
RUSH TO STRASBOURG A MOVE WHICH 
COSTS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION A YEAR EVEN 
WITHOUT THE COST OF THE FLIGHTS AND 
HOTELS THERE'S A BIGGER HEADACHE 
THAN THIS THEY VOTED TO KEEP 
SECRET REPORT INTO EXPENSES 
FIDDLING MAKING SOME INCANDESCENT 
SOME MEMBERS DON'T SEEM TO GET IT 
TO REALISE WE HAVE TO HAVE PROPER 
PUBLIC SCRUTINY AND OPENNESS ABOUT 
OUR FINANCIAL AFFAIRS AND WE ARE 
ACCEPT PRACTICE THAT'S WE WOULDN'T 
TOLERATE IF IT WAS BEING CARRIED 
OUT BY ANY OTHER EUROPEAN 
INSTITUTION IF SOME CITIZENS 
ACROSS EUROPE TODAY THINK THERE ARE 
MORE HONEST PEOPLE TO BE FOUND IN 
PRISON THAN IN THE EUROPEAN 
PARLIAMENT WELL I'D HAVE TO HAVE 
SYMPATHY FOR THAT VIEW IT'S IT'S TYPICAL OF HOW THE EUROPEAN UNION 
OPERATES THEY'RE SECRETIVE ABOUT 
ALL THESE THINGS THEY'RE SECRETIVE 
ABOUT PLANS FOR CLOSER UNION THE 
LISBON TREATY AND ABOUT THEIR OWN 
EXPENSES 
WHAT'S BEHIND THIS IS A EXPENSES REPORT INTO THE EMPLOYMENT OF STAFF 
AN ASSISTN'T TO A GERMAN MEP MAKING 
THE DRIVE TO STRASBOURG IS EMPLOYED 
ABSOLUTELY PROPERLY AND IS REAL 
THERE'S AN UNPUBLISHED AUDIT THAT 
SAYS SOME CLAIM FOR IMAGINARY 
ASSISTANTS AND POCKET THE MONEY 
EACH MEP GETS MORE THAN S. P. D. S. ONE SIXTY TWO ZERO ZERO ZERO 
A YEAR TO PAY FOR STAFF WHICH ADDS 
UP TO ONE HUNDRED TWELVE MILLION A YEAR THIS 
DUTCH MEP HAS PASSED NAMES TO THE 
FRAUD OFFICE OF FELLOW MEMBERS WHOM 
HE SAYS ARE MAKING FALSE CLAIMS 
IT'S PAYING TO FAKE COMPANIES IT'S 
PAYING TO HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN 
IT'S GOOD POCKETING THE MONEY AND 
THROUGH KICK BACK MECHANISMS THE THE LIFTS MAY HAVE A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREE CLEAR 
VIEW ALROUND BUT MEPS TODAY 
HAVEN'T VOTED FOR GREATER 
TRANSPARENCY INDEED THEY'VE SAID 
THE AUDITORS' REPORT AND ALL SUCH 
REPORTS IN THE FUTURE SHOULD REMAIN 
SECRET THE MAJORITY WHO VOTED THAT 
IN PRACTICE AND IN PRINCIPLE AUD 
ITS SHOULD NOT BE MADE PUBLIC FEEL 
CONFIDENTIAL REPORTS ARE A BETTER 
WAY OF DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM 
WHICH THEY THINK IS SMALL SCALE 
THEY HAVE BACKED ONE IDEA WHICH 
WILL BE TOUGHER THAN WESTMINSTER 
RULES CALLING FOR A BAN ON 
EMPLOYING FAMILY MEMBERS ONE 
BRITISH MEP WHOSE WIFE IS HIS 
SECRETARY SAYS IT'S A SMOKE SCREEN 
SHE'S QUALIFIED TO DO THE JOB SHE 
DOES THAT JOB IN MY OFFICE 
EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT AND SHE'S 
PAID IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RATE 
FOR THE JOB SHE DOES DO WHAT 
WORRIES ME ABOUT THIS IS THAT 
THERE'S AN ATTEMPT BY SOME PEOPLE 
TO THROW A BIT OF RED MEAT TO THE 
LIONS IN THE HOPE IT WILL KEEP THEM 
SATISFIED I. E. THE MEDIA WHEN IT 
WON'T 
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS THE WON'T LORRIES WILL LOAD UP AGAIN AND HEAD 
BACK TO BRUSSELS ALONG WITH A 
GROWING BUT CLEARLY INSUFFICIENT 
NUMBER OF MEPS WHO FEEL THINGS 
CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS 
NOW DEMOCRATIC VOTERS IN 
PENNSYLVANIA ARE CHOOSING THE 
CANDIDATE THEY WANT TO RUN IN THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION LATE THER 
YEAR HILLARY CLINTON WHO'S BEEN 
LOSING GROUND TO BARACK OBAMA NEEDS 
A CONVINCING WIN TO REVIVE HER 
CAMPAIGN JUSTIN WEBB IS IN 
PHILADELPHIA PHILADELPHIA HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS TO WIN 
TONIGHT IF SHE DOESN'T WIN AND 
DOESN'T WIN BIG THERE IS A BIG 
CHANCE TO THE MONEY FOR HER 
CAMPAIGN SIMPLY RUNS OUT WHAT IF 
SHE DOES WIN WHAT IF SHE WINS BIG 
CAN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SURVOIF A 
CONTINUING CIVIL WAR 
THEY ARE ALL IN ONE PARTY THEY'RE 
ALL DEMOCRATS BUT IT SOMETIMES 
DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY THESE DAYS 
ON THE STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA WE 
WITNESSED AN ILL TEMPERED CLASH 
BETWEEN HER BACKERS AND HIS DON'T DON'T HATE THE DREAM DON'T HATE THE 
DREAM OBAMA 
THE CANDIDATES HAVE 
BEEN THROWING EVERYTHING INTO THIS 
FIGHT AN EARLY MORNING BREAKFAST 
IN A DINER FOR BARACK OBAMA WITH 
THE SENATOR TALKING DOWN HIS 
CHANCES OF VICTORY 
IT'S AN UPHILL 
BATTLE SENATOR CLINTON HAD A TWENTY 
POINT LEAD TO START WITH WE'VE 
CLOSED IT BUT STILL I THINK WE 
HAVE TO CONSIDER OURSELVES THE 
UNDERDOGS 
MRS. CLINTON IN UNDERDOGS PHILADELPHIA PEEVED BY THE NOTION 
THAT A WIN BY A FEW PER CENTAGE 
POINTS WOULD NOT BE GOOD ENOUGH TO 
KEEP HER CAMPAIGN ALIVE 
A WIN IS A 
WIN MY OPPONENT HAS OUTSPENT ME 
FOUR TO ONE AN ENORMOUS EFFORT ON 
HIS PART ON T. V. RADIO ON THE 
PHONES AND IN EVERY WAY THAT IS 
IMAGINABLE TO TRY TO WIN 
PENNSYLVANIA 
AS IF TO UNDERLINE PENNSYLVANIA HER TOUGHNESS SHE HAD A MEMORABLE 
ANSWER UP HER SLEEVE WHEN ASKED 
ABOUT AMERICA'S RESPONSE IF IRAN 
ATTACKED ISRAEL 
WE WOULD BE ABLE 
TO TOTALLY OBLITERATE THEM THAT'S 
A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY BUT THOSE 
PEOPLE WHO RUN IRAN NEED TO 
UNDERSTAND THAT 
HER TOUGHNESS IS 
AN ASSET THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT 
THAT ON AMERICA'S MOST POPULAR 
WRESTLING SHOW THEY STAGED A FIGHT 
TO MIRROR THE PRIMARY SEASON SO FAR 
WITH HIM SCORING THE EARLY SMACK 
DOWNS BUT HER COMING BACK AGAIN 
AND AGAIN FOR MORE 
BUT NOTHING SUBTLE THIS IS AMAZING 
IT IS AMAZING BUT 
MANY VOTERS WOULD LIKE IT TO STOP 
THEY WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY TURN OUT 
AGAIN TODAY IN RECORD NUMBERS BUT 
WITH A GROWING SENSE THAT THE 
CANDIDATES RISK DOING EACH OTHER 
AND THE PARTY PERMANENT INJURY A A LOT OF VOTERS THOUGHT THIS WAS A 
SPECIAL RACE A SPECIAL TIME TWO 
OBVIOUSLY UNUSUAL CANDIDATES AN 
AFRICAN AMERICAN A WOMAN A VERY 
DIFFERENT KIND OF ELECTION AND IN 
THE LAST SIX WEEKS IT SEEMED A 
LITTLE MORE ORDINARY 
IT'S TRUE 
THAT MANY DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT 
THIS LONG CAMPAIGN IS HURTING THEIR 
PARTY'S CHANCES BUT THEY MIGHT BE 
WRONG IF THE TWO CANDIDATES CAN 
FIND A WAY OF ENDING THIS PROCESS 
WITHOUT A CALAMITOUS FALLING OUT 
THE PARTY COULD STILL BE IN VERY 
GOOD SHAPE IT IS A BIG IF BUT 
IT'S A BIG PRIZE AS WELL AFTER ALL 
MILLIONS OF DEMOCRATS HERE AND 
ELSEWHERE ARE MASSIVELY ENERGISED 
WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR THE BATTLE 
AGAINST THE REPUBLICANS THEY WILL 
PRESUMABLY STILL WANT TO WIN 
THAT OF COURSE IS ALL IN THE FUTURE 
RIGHT NOW WE'RE WAITING FOR THE 
RESULTS IN PENNSYLVANIA FOR THE 
POLLS TO CLOSE AND THE RESULT TO BE 
KNOWN THE DEMOCRATS OF 
PENNSYLVANIA NEVER THOUGHT THEIR 
PRIMARY WAS GOING TO KOUPBTD FOR 
MUCH IN THIS PROCESS THEY HAVE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A REAL IMPACT 
BY THE WAY YOU CAN FOLLOW ALL THE 
RESULTS THEY'LL BE ON THE B. B. C.

WITH MATT FREI 
THE CHANCELLOR HAS PROMISED HELP 
BEFORE THE END OF THIS FINANCIAL 
YEAR FOR PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX BAND 
ALISTAIR DARLING MADE THE PLEDGE TO 
AVERT A REVOLT BY LABOUR 
BACKBENCHERS THE CHANGE MEANS MORE 
THAN FIVE MILLION OF THE LOWEST 
EARNERS ARE WORSE OFF 
BRITAIN'S SECOND BIGGEST BANK THE 
ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND HAS ASKED 
ITS SHAREHOLDERS FOR TWELVE BILLION IN 
CASH TO PROTECT IT FROM THE 
POSSIBLE STORMS AHEAD IN THE 
BANKING MARKET THE REQUEST WAS 
MADE AS THE CHANCELLOR HELD A 
MEETING WITH THE HEADS BRITAIN'S 
MAIN MORTGAGE LENDERS HE URGED 
THEM TO REDUCE THE COST OF 
MORTGAGES FOR MILLIONS OF 
HOMEOWNERS BUT THE CHANCES OF THAT 
HAPPENING SEEM TO BE REMOTE 
THIS IS A MONUMENT TO THE BOOM BOOM 
HOUSING MARKET OF YESTERDAY A 
TOWER IN MANCHESTER WHERE EVERY 
FLAT WAS SOLD BEFORE IT WAS 
COMPLETED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WHAT A DUFRPBS A 
COUPLE OF YEARS MAKES TODAY MORE 
THAN A QUARTER OF THEM ARE BACK ON 
THE MARKET AND THEY AREN'T SHIFTING 
LIKE HOT CAKES HOMES GENERALLY 
AREN'T SELLING LIKE THEY WERE AND 
HOUSE PRICES ARE FALLING IN PART 
BECAUSE MORTGAGES ARE HARDER AND 
MORE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN TO WARD 
OFF A PAINFUL BUST BANKERS 
CONTROLLING SIXTY PER CENT OF THE MORTGAGE 
MARKET INCLUDING THE BOSSES OF HOL 
FAX AND NATIONWIDE TODAY TROOPED 
IN TO SEE THE CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR 
DARLINGMENT WHAT'S BEEN WORRYING 
THE CHANCELLOR IS THAT EVEN THOUGH 
THE OFFICIAL BASE LENDING RATE'S 
BEEN FALLING FOR MANY OF US 
MORTGAGES ARE BECOMING MORE 
EXPENSIVE SO ALISTAIR DARLING 
ASKED BANKERS TO HAVE I HEART AND 
CUT MORTGAGE RATES BUT HERE'S THE 
EMBARRASSING THING FOR HIM HIS 
GREAT MATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND MERVYN KING 
DOESN'T THINK IT WOULD BE SENSIBLE 
FOR BANKS TO START OFFERING 
FABULOUS MORTGAGE DEALS AGAIN 
BECAUSE HE THINKS THEY'RE TOO RISKY 
AND WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MESS 
WE'RE IN ONE FORMER CHANCELLOR 
THINKS THE GOVERNOR WILL WIN THIS 
ARGUMENT 
IT'S REALLY THE ARGUMENT CHANCELLOR TRYING TO ADVERTISE I 
KNOW YOU'RE HURTING OUT THERE I'M 
TALKING TO THE BUILDING SOCIETIES 
ABOUT IT THERE'S NOT A LOT HE CAN 
DO 
FOLLOWING THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S DO DECISION TO PUMP MONEY INTO THE 
BANKING SYSTEM THE HOUSING 
MINISTER INSISTS THAT BANKS MUST DO 
THEIR BIT 
IT IS OUR EXPECTATION 
WHERE WE HAVE DONE WHAT THE 
INDUSTRY HAS ASKED THEY RETURN THAT 
BY SHOWING THEY WILL PASS ON 
INTEREST RATE CUTS TO THE PEOPLE 
THAT ARE THEIR CLIENTS 
HERE'S WHY 
SHE'S LIKELY TO BE DISAPPOINTED 
LAST YEAR AT THE TALE TAIL END OF 
THE MORTGAGE BOOM BANKS MADE 
ALMOST NO PROFITS ON THEIR 
MORTGAGES THEY'VE WIDENED THE GAP 
BETWEEN THEIR COST OF MONEY AND 
WHAT THEY RECEIVE TO OH SIX PER CENT BUT 
THAT'S STILL A FRACTION OF THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE 
PER CENTAGE POINTS TEN YEARS AGO 
BANKS' PRIORITY IS TO REBUILD 
PROFITS AND RAISE CAPITAL TO 
STRENGTHEN THEMSELVES WHICH IS WHY 
ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND TODAY ASKED 
FOR A RECORD BREAKING TWELVE BILLION 
FROM SHAREHOLDERS IN A RIGHTS ISSUE 
OF NEW SHARES IT AND THE OTHER 
BANKS FEEL THEY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD 
TO PILE THOSE MORTGAGES HIGH AND 
SELL THEM CHEAP 
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE HAS NAMED 
THE SOLDIER KILLED IN AN EXPLOSION 
IN AFGHANISTAN YESTERDAY HE WAS 
TROOPER ROBERT PEARSON OF THE 
QUEEN'S ROYAL LANCERS THE TWENTY TWO YEAR 
OLD FROM GRIMSBY IN LINCOLNSHIRE 
WAS IN AN ARMOURED VEHICLE IN 
HELMAND PROVINCE WHEN IT HIT A MINE 
A SECOND SOLDIER WAS INJURED 
THE B. B. C. HAS LEARNED THAT HUNDREDS 
OF AMERICAN TROOPS ARE FIGHTING IN 
BASRA ALONGSIDE THE IRAQI ARMY IN 
THEIR CAMPAIGN AGAINST MILITANT 
MILITIA GROUPS BASRA WAS UNDER 
BRITISH CONTROL UNTIL LAST DECEMBER 
THERE ARE FOUR THOUSAND BRITISH TROOPS 
STATIONED AT A BASE OUTSIDE THE 
CITY IT'S UNDERSTOOD THEY ARE 
OFFERING SOME SUPPORT TO THE 
OPERATION OPERATION AMERICANS UNDER ATTACK IN IRAQ 
THERE'S NOTHING UNUSUAL IN THAT 
BUT THIS IS BASRA THE PLACE WHERE 
BRITISH TROOPS ARE BASED THESE 
FIGHTERS ARE THE REASON WHY THE 
AMERICANS ARE IN THE CITY FOR 
WEEKS THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES 
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DEFEAT THE 
SHI'ITE MILITIAMEN FROM THE MAHDI 
ARMY BUT NOW IT'S EMERGED THAT 
BRITAIN AND AMERICA HAVE STEPPED IN 
THE B. B. C.'S LEARNED THAT OVER THE 
PAST TWO WEEKS AS MANY AS ONE THOUSAND U. S. 
COMBAT TROOPS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO 
BASS ARE FROM OTHER PARTS OF IRAQ 
AND THE MIDDLE EAST OUTSIDE THE 
CITY AT THE AIRPORT A MORE THAN 
FOUR THOUSAND BRITISH PERSONNEL THEY HAVE 
AN OVERWATCH CAPACITY IN PRACTICE 
THAT MEANS TRAINING IRAQI SOLDIERS 
A WESTERN MILITARY SOURCE TELLS US 
IT INCLUDES MEN TORG BY SPECIAL 
FORCES ON THE GROUND BRITISH AND 
AMERICAN TROOPS ARE OPERATING 
COVERTLY IN BASRA TRYING TO DETAIN 
HIGH VALUE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE 
MILITIAS 
BASRA WE THINK HAS BEEN MILITIAS ESSENTIALLY CLEARED IT WILL HAVE 
TO BE HELD AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A 
MAN POWER INTENSIVE ON THE SPOT 
ON THE GROUND JOB THAT WILL FALL 
PRIMARILY TO THE IRAQIS SO THE 
LONG TERM PROSPECTS ARE ESSENTIALLY 
THAT THE AMERICANS AND IRAQIS WILL 
HAVE TO STEP UP AND COMPLETE THE 
JOB IN BASRA 
THERE ARE MORE THAN 
HALF A MILLION MEMBERS OF THE IRAQI 
SECURITY FORCES AND THEY ARE 
CRITICAL TO AMERICAN POLICY IN THIS 
COUNTRY EVENTUALLY THE UNITED 
STATES WANTS TO HAND OVER SECURITY 
CONTROL TO THEM BUT AS A LEADING 
GENERAL RECENTLY SAID THEY'RE NOT 
YET READY TO DEFEND IRAQ 
IN RECENT WEEKS MANY HAVE DESERTED 
SOMETIMES TO CLERICS LOYAL TO THE 
MILITIA THEY'RE MEANT TO BE 
FIGHTING OTHERS QUIETLY WENT HOME 
LIKE THIS MAN WHO DOESN'T WANT TO 
SHOW HIS FACE 
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT IRAQIS OR MUSLIMS HOW CAN SOMEONE 
FIGHT HIS BROTHER OR HIS COUSIN 
HOW CAN I TILL HIM IN THE STREETS 
AS EVENING FALLS BASRA'S REPORTED 
TO BE QUIETER FOR THAT TO LAST 
IT'S LIKELY THAT BRITISH AND 
AMERICAN BOOTS WILL HAVE TO STAY ON 
THE GROUND 
COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
MY GOD IT'S WRONG WITH ALL HE'S 
TAKEN 
IT WAS THE MOST FAMOUS OF TAKEN FILMS BUT CAN GONE WITH THE WIND 
WORK ON THE WEST END STAGE 
A MAN IN CUMBRIA HAS BEEN GIVEN A 
CRIMINAL RECORD FOR OVERFILLING HIS 
BIN COPELAND COUNCIL SAYS GARETH 
CORKHILL HAD BEEN GIVEN PREVIOUS 
WARNINGS AND ONLY HAS HIMSELF TO 
BLAME MR. CORKHILL WAS GIVEN AN ON 
THE SPOT FINE BECAUSE THE LID OF 
THE BIN WASN'T FULLY CLOSED HE 
REFUSED TO PAY THE FINE AND WENT TO 
COURT COURT GARETH CORKHILL HAS A CRIMINAL 
RECORD THIS IS THE SCENE OF THE 
CRIME HE PUT SO MUCH RUBBISH INTO 
HIS FAMILY BIN HE COULDN'T QUITE 
CLOSE THE LID THE COUNCIL TOOK 
THIS GRAINY PHOTOGRAPH AND LATER 
ISSUED HIM WITH A FIXED PENALTY 
NOTICE FOR HAVING HIS BIN LID OPEN 
HE WAS FINED ONE HUNDRED TEN BUT HE REFUSED 
TO PAY IT THE CASE THEN WENT TO 
COURT AND HE WAS FINED ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FOR NOT HAVING HIS 
BIN LID CLOSED 
I'M QUITE ANNOYED 
BECAUSE AS I KID I WAS TOLD TO PUT 
RUBBISH IN THE BIN L. TEACH MY KIDS 
TO PUT IT IN THE BIN L. GOT FINED 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FOR PUTTING RUBBISH IN MY OWN 
BIN 
COUNCIL SAY THE FAMILY HAD BIN BEEN ISSUED WITH WARNINGS AND HAD 
BEEN GIVEN AN EXTRA LARGE BIN THEY 
SAY THEY DID NOTHING WRONG 
I THINK 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING L. CAN'T 
BELIEVE IT'S A CRIMINAL OFFENCE L. 
JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT IN THE 
FUTURE IT CAN CAUSE US PROBLEMS FOR 
DOING WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO 
AND PUT YOUR RUBBISH IN YOUR BIN 
OVER TO THE MAN FROM THE COUNCIL 
IN RETROSPECT WAS THIS NOT AN 
OVERREACTION 
AT FACE VALUE IT OVERREACTION APPEARS SO BUT BEARING IN MIND THE 
PREVIOUS HISTORY AND HOW WE'VE 
WORKED WITH THE FAMILY TRYING TO 
HELP THEM BUT THEY PERSISTENTLY 
OFFENDED AND IT CAME TO THIS WHAT WHAT IS POLICY WHAT HERE IS THAT O. K. AS LONG 
AS IT'S NEARLY CLOSED IS THAT O. K. 
THE LINE WE TAKE WITH OUR RESIDENTS 
WHEN ISSUING ADVICE IS BIN LID 
CLOSED SO CLOSED MEANS CLOSED NOT NOT EVEN THAT 
CLOSED MEANS CLOSED NOT 
EVEN THAT SINCE FORTNIGHTLY BIN COLLECTIONS 
BEGAN RUBBISH HAS NEVER BEEN SO 
CONTROVERSIAL IN SCUNTHORPE PEOPLE 
TOOK DIRECT ACTION BUT THE RULES 
ON THE STREET HAVE CHANGED AND 
ANYONE WHO BREAKS THEM HAS TO PAY 
THE PENALTY 
BRITAIN'S MAIN AIRPLT OPERATOR B. A. A. 
MAY HAVE TO SELL AT LEAST ONE OF 
ITS SIGHTS AFTER CRITICISM FROM THE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION B. A. A. OWNS 
SEVEN AIRPORTS IN THE U. K. BUT THE 
COMMISSION SAYS IT MAY NOT BE 
SERVING THE INTERESTS OF EITHER AIR 
LOINS OR PASSENGERS THE TRANSPORT 
SECRETARY RUTH KELLY HAS ORDERED A 
REVIEW OF THE WAY BRITAIN'S 
AIRPORTS ARE REGULATED 
RUNNING AN AIRPORT IS A CHALLENGE 
ON A GOOD DAY INCREASING 
PASSENGERS TIGHTER SECURITY 
DEMANDING AIRLINES AS FOR THE 
OPENING OF NEW TERMINAL WELL B. A. A. 
PLAYED ITS OWN PART IN THAT FIASCO 
PLEASE ACCEPT OUR APOLOGIES THE THE COMPETITION COMMISSION'S CONCLUDED 
ONE BIG COMPANY RUNNING THE BIGGEST 
AIRPORTS IS BAD FOR COMPETITION AND 
THAT'S BAD FOR PASSENGERS SO THE 
COMMISSION MAY BREAK UP B. A. A.'S 
EMPIRE IT WANTS GLASGOW AND ED 
TPWROU COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER B. A. A. 
MAY HAVE TO SELL ONE BETWEEN 
HEATHROW GATWICK AND STANSTED 
GATWICK IS THE MOST LIKELY FOR SALE 
B. A. A. IS CONCENTRATING ON HEATHROW I I DON'T THINK GATWICK SHOULD BE SOLD 
OFF BUT I DO THINK HEATHROW'S A 
VERY PARTICULAR CASE AND WE NEED TO 
GIVE CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE 
HEATHROW INVESTMENTS REQUIRED THE THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT PASSENGERS 
ARE WILLING TO SWITCH BETWEEN 
AIRPORTS AS LONG AS THEY'RE OWNED 
BY DIFFERENT OPERATORS EACH 
COMPETING TO OFFER A BETTER SERVICE 
IN FACT SOME AIRLINES BELIEVE THERE 
SHOULD BE DIFFERENT TERMINALS OWNED 
BY DIFFERENT COMPANIES ALL 
COMPETING THE IDEA IS TO MAKE B. A. A. 
MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE DEMANDS OF 
AIRLINES AND PASSENGERS PERHAPS 
REMOVING SHOPS TO PROVIDE MORE 
SPACE OR CUTTING THE SECURITY 
QUEUES AND KEEPING THE PRICE OF 
PARKING UNDER CONTROL THIS AIRLINE 
BELIEVES IT WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS 
KEY ISSUES 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO 
SPEED THINGS UP AND HOW ARE YOU 
GOING TO LAY OUT A ROAD MAP FOR A 
BETTER SERVICE IN FUTURE 
AND OUT 
OF THE BLUE TODAY THE GOVERNMENT 
MADE ITS OWN ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE OUR 
AIRPORTS BY ORDERING AN URGENT 
REVIEW OF THE CIVIL AVIATION 
AUTHORITY RESPONSIBLE FOR 
REGULATING B. A. A.'S FINANCES FOR THE 
AVIATION INDUSTRY THIS IS TURNING 
INTO A BUSY YEAR
