THIS DECADE SAW THE BURSTING FORTH 
OF ALL THE CREATIVE TALENTS 
THAT HAD BEEN REPRESSED BY WARTIME RATIONING SCARCITY 
CENSORSHIP AND WAR AND THEY WERE READY TO GO 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE HIDING DON'T BE SILLY HAYDN'S BEEN DEAD FOR YEARS 
AFTER THE WAR THERE WAS THE RISE OF A NEW KIND OF COMEDIAN 
A COMEDIAN MADE SUPERSTAR BY THEIR APPEARANCES ON RADIO 
I ENJOY BEING ON ME OWN 
ARE YOU AN ECCENTRIC 
NO I'M NOT JUST LEAVE ME ALONE 
THEY BROUGHT A LOT OF THE ARMED SERVICES' HUMOUR WITH THEM 
THIS STRANGE UM SURREAL HUMOUR THAT THEY HAD 
TO TAKE THEIR MIND OFF WHAT THEY WERE GOING THROUGH IN THE WAR AND I DON'T THINK THAT HAD BEEN HEARD TOO MUCH 
THAT WAS A REAL BLAST OF FRESH AIR 
IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE BRITAIN'S BROADCASTING INDUSTRY WAS ABOUT TO UNDERGO A REVOLUTION 
HITHERTO RADIO WAS THE DOMINANT MEDIUM 
AND IT DELIVERED AN ALMOST UNBROKEN DIET OF MUSIC SHOWS GENTEEL COMEDIES AND CONVENTIONAL DRAMAS 
BUT RADIO'S MONOPOLY OF THE AIRWAVES WAS COMING TO AN END 
AND TRADITIONAL FORMS OF LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT NOW CAME UNDER SUSTAINED ASSAULT 
FROM A NEW GENERATION OF WRITERS PRODUCERS AND PERFORMERS 
MANY OF WHOM HAD BEEN RADICALISED BY THEIR EXPERIENCES OF WAR 
AFTER THE DEFEAT OF THE NAZIS BRITAIN REJOICED 
BUT THE EUPHORIA MASKED A WIDESPREAD DISSATISFACTION WITH THE OLD ORDER 
THE EXPERIENCE OF WAR HAD SHIFTED TASTES AND ATTITUDES 
BRITAIN WAS DESPERATE FOR CHANGE 
ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO'D FOUGHT THE WAR CAME BACK 
THEY'D VOTED CHURCHILL OUT OF POWER 
WHY BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CREATE A NEW BRITAIN 
A NEW CULT FOR LIFE 
IT WAS A PERIOD OF GREATER SOCIAL CHANGE 
THAN BRITAIN HAD SEEN SINCE THE CIVIL WAR 
THERE WAS A SHOCK FOR A LOT OF MEN 
THAT THE POSITIONS THAT THEY HELD AND THE ATTITUDES THAT THEY'D ENJOYED BEFORE THEY'D GONE TO WAR 
HAD OBVIOUSLY RADICALLY CHANGED DURING THE WAR 
THE WAR HAD BEEN A GREAT LEVELLER 
IT HAD PUT PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT CLASSES TOGETHER 
AND PEOPLE DID HAVE A MORE COMMUNAL SPIRIT 
THERE WAS A WORKING CLASS ETHOS THAT PEOPLE QUITE ADMIRED AND RESPECTED 
AFTER THAT THERE WAS AN EGALITARIAN MOOD WITHIN THE COUNTRY 
AND SOME OF THE ENTERTAINERS THAT CAME ALONG THEY RODE ON THIS MOOD 
UNTIL NINETEEN THIRTY NINE B. B. C. RADIO OFFERED A SERVICE 
THAT WAS FIRMLY ROOTED IN THE TRADITIONS OF BRITISH MUSIC HALL IN WARTIME IT WAS CONSIDERED IMPORTANT 
TO MAINTAIN THE TRADITIONAL MIX OF MUSIC DRAMA AND COMEDY AS A MEANS OF BOOSTING THE NATION'S MORALE 
IN ORDER TO WELCOME THAT MAN AGAIN 
STUMP YES NO 
B. B. C. RADIO HAD A GREAT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE WAR 
AND THERE WERE GREAT COMEDIANS 
THERE WERE VERY VERY FUNNY PEOPLE 
AND THEY LARGELY CAME FROM THE MUSIC HALL THAT WAS WHERE YOU LAUGHED 
I STARTED PACKING MY BAGS THE WIFE SAID WHERE ARE YOU GOING PARIS 
WHAT'LL YOU USE FOR MONEY FRANCS FRANK'S NOT GOING 
DURING THE WAR THERE HAD BEEN THE NEED TO KEEP EVERYBODY'S SPIRITS UP 
SO THERE WAS LOTS OF FORCED JOLLITY 
WITH REFERENCES TO WAR EFFORT AND YOUR CHEEKY CHAPPIE HUMOUR 
BUT YOU COULDN'T MAKE JOKES ABOUT RELIGION OR CLASS OR COLOUR 
THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN ON THE B. B. C. 
WHEN I LEFT ENGLAND TO COME AND WORK FOR ENSA THEY SAID 
YOU'LL HAVE TO WEAR A BATTLEDRESS 
I SAID WHAT'S THE IDEA AFTER ALL I'M AN ACTOR NOT A SOLDIER 
YOU'LL HAVE TO WEAR A BATTLEDRESS BECAUSE IF YOU GET CAPTURED BY THE GERMANS THEY'LL SHOOT YOU 
I SAID IF THE GERMANS CAPTURE ME THEY'RE ENTITLED TO SHOOT ME 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT RADIO PRIOR TO THE WAR AND RADIO DURING THE WAR 
YOU SEE THAT THE ENTERTAINERS THERE THEY SUDDENLY HAVE THIS FREEDOM 
CAN I DO YOU NOW SIR 
THE RACIER AND MORE IRREVERENT HUMOUR APPEARING ON THE AIRWAVES 
COINCIDED WITH THE FLOOD OF AMERICAN G. I.'S ARRIVING IN THEIR THOUSANDS 
DURING THE BUILD UP TO D. DAY IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR 
THE B. B. C. ADJUSTED ITS OUTPUT TO CATER FOR THE TASTES OF BRITAIN'S GUESTS 
IT'S GENERAL FORCES PROGRAMMES PLAYED POPULAR BIG BAND AND SWING RECORDINGS BY FORCES' FAVOURITES 
IT LEFT A GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE ADDICTED TO AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE 
BRITAIN WAS ABOUT TO EMBARK ON A LOVE AFFAIR WITH AMERICAN MUSIC COMEDY AND GLAMOUR 
AMERICA WAS ANOTHER WORLD 
WE'D ONLY SEEN IT ON HOLLYWOOD FILMS AND WHEN AMERICANS ARRIVED 
WE'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO GLAMOROUS THEY WERE VERY ENERGETIC 
THEY HAD THE ENERGY OF A NEW COUNTRY AND WE WERE A TIRED COUNTRY BY THEN 
WE WERE VERY EXHAUSTED SO TO HAVE THEM FLINGING YOUNG WOMEN AROUND THE FLOOR WAS SENSATIONAL 
I WENT TO SEE OKLAHOMA WHEN IT WAS ON TOUR 
AND WE WERE TRANSPORTED BY IT 
OH WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MORNING 
WE'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT 
POST WAR YOU FIND THIS INVASION OF THE BIG AMERICAN MUSICALS 
AND THE MOST FAMOUS OF COURSE IS OKLAHOMA 
AND JUST TOOK LONDON AND BRITAIN BY STORM 
ON THE RADIO YOU'D HEAR ALL THE CLASSIC SONGS FROM OKLAHOMA 
OH WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MORNING AND ALL THE REST BEING ENDLESSLY PLAYED AND IT BECAME A SYMBOL OF ENERGY 
VIVACITY A SORT OF TECHNICOLOUR LIFE 
WHICH WE IN POST WAR ENGLAND OR BRITAIN DIDN'T KNOW AT FIRST HAND 
THE INFLUENCE OF AMERICA ON ONE'S LIFE AND UPBRINGING WAS TREMENDOUS 
BUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WAR ON B. B. C. RADIO 
AMERICAN GLAMOUR WAS CONSPICUOUS BY ITS ABSENCE 
THE B. B. C.'S DIRECTOR GENERAL LORD REITH HAD PROMISED THE GOVERNMENT 
THAT THE CORPORATION'S OUTPUT WOULD INFORM AND EDUCATE AS WELL AS ENTERTAIN 
CERTAINLY THE B. B. C. OF THIS PERIOD 
AND B. B. C. RADIO IN PARTICULAR 
IT'S STILL FOLLOWING LORD REITH'S IDEA REITHIAN PRINCIPLES 
TO EDUCATE ILLUMINATE AND ENTERTAIN PROBABLY IN THAT ORDER 
HE HAD A DOWN ON ENTERTAINMENT HE THOUGHT OF IT AS VERY INFERIOR 
BUT IT HAD TO BE THERE FOR THE MASSES DID IT HE'D RATHER WISHED IT DIDN'T 
THIS IS THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION 
LILLIBURLERO BY DAVID ARNOLD 
THE B. B. C. EXPRESSED ITS COMMITMENT TO REITHIAN VALUES IN NINETEEN FORTY SIX 
WITH THE LAUNCH OF THE THIRD PROGRAMME 
AN UNAPOLOGETICALLY HIGH BROW RADIO CHANNEL 
OFFERING A SCHEDULE DOMINATED BY SERIOUS TALK SHOWS CLASSICAL MUSIC AND HEAVYWEIGHT DRAMA 
WHEN THE THIRD PROGRAMME WAS LAUNCHED IT WAS LAUNCHED AS THE TOP LAYER 
THE TOP LEVEL OF WHAT WAS SEEN AS A KIND OF STEP PROCESS 
BY PEOPLE IN THE B. B. C. WHO BELIEVED THAT BROADCASTERS THEY 
COULD DRAG PEOPLE UP DRAG THE AUDIENCE UP BY ITS SHOULDERS 
FROM ONE CULTURAL LEVEL TO ANOTHER 
THE THIRD PROGRAMME WAS THE ABSOLUTE TOP LEVEL OF CULTURE 
WHERE YOU HAD LARGELY ORCHESTRAL MUSIC CLASSICAL WESTERN ORCHESTRAL MUSIC AND SERIOUS PLAYS 
A DRUM A DRUM MACBETH DOTH COME 
THE WEIRD SISTERS HAND IN HAND 
THE THIRD PROGRAMME WAS MY LIFELINE 
IT WAS WHERE YOU WENT FOR A WHOLE RANGE OF NEW MUSIC 
BY WHICH I MEAN SHOSTAKOVICH 
PLAYS THEATRES THEY'D TRANSMIT PROGRAMMES IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES 
IT WAS LIKE A UNIVERSITY COURSE BUT ON RADIO IT WAS THRILLING 
THIS EVENING SIR ISAIAH BERLIN GIVES THE SECOND OF FOUR TALKS 
PERHAPS I OUGHT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BODY OF MEN 
ENEMIES CALLED IT A BODY OF FECKLESS YOUNG MEN WHO HAD NO EMPLOYMENT AND WHO WERE PARASITES UPON SOCIETY 
IT WAS SEEN AS BEING VERY HIGH BROW 
AND MOST PEOPLE REGARDED IT THEN AS I THINK MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY STILL REGARD RADIO THREE TODAY 
AS VERY HOITY TOITY PRETENTIOUS AND NOT WHAT THEY WANT 
IT HAS NEVER HAD MORE THAN A RELATIVELY SMALL AUDIENCE 
HOW TO LISTEN INCLUDING HOW NOT TO 
HOW YOU OUGHT TO AND HOW YOU WON'T 
THE THIRD PROGRAMME 
WAS AN ABSOLUTE INTELLECTUAL GHETTO I DON'T THINK I EVER STRAYED THERE 
IT WAS REGARDED AS REMOTE AND DAUNTING 
BUT ON ITS OTHER CHANNELS THE B. B. C.'S OUTPUT WAS LESS ELITIST AND MORE PRACTICAL 
LAUNCHED IN THE SAME YEAR AS THE THIRD PROGRAMME 
WOMAN'S HOUR SELF CONSCIOUSLY PROMOTED FAMILY VALUES 
THE SERIES OFFERED USEFUL ADVICE TO HOUSEWIVES RETURNING TO THE HOME AFTER A WARTIME SPENT AT WORK 
ITS OPENING EDITION WAS PRESENTED BY A MAN 
AND FEATURED ITEMS ON MOTHER'S MIDDAY MEALS CATCHING MICE AND KNITTING YOUR OWN STAIR CARPET 
WOMAN'S HOUR 
A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE BRITISH POPULATION OF WOMEN DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO HOME MAKING 
THIS MORNING WE HAVE A YORKSHIRE HOUSEWIFE IN THE STUDIO MRS. CHAD 
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WASHING DAY 
WASHING DAY IN YOUR HOME 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SWITCH OFF THE RADIO ARE YOU 
PLEASE DON'T 
THEY WERE MAKING THEIR OWN CLOTHES 
THEY WERE MAKING DO AND MENDING THAT WAS THE PHRASE MAKE DO AND MEND 
THEY WERE RECYCLING THERE WAS STILL A GREAT SCARCITY OF EVERYTHING 
SO YOU'D MAKE A LAMPSHADE OUT OF THIS FRUIT BOWL OUT OF THAT 
IT WAS FULL OF LITTLE AND RATHER LUDICROUS TIPS FOR HOUSEWIVES 
I THINK WOMAN'S HOUR WAS ENORMOUSLY POPULAR WITH THE MAJORITY OF MAINSTREAM MIDDLE BROW 
MIDDLE CLASS WOMEN I THINK THAT'S WHO THERE WERE THE BROADCASTERS AND THAT'S WHO THEY TALKED TO 
TO CAPTURE THE MALE AUDIENCE B. B. C. RADIO PUT THE ACCENT ON ESCAPISM AND ADVENTURE 
IN NINETEEN FORTY SIX THE LIGHT PROGRAMME LAUNCHED DICK BARTON SPECIAL AGENT 
BRITAIN'S FIRST DAILY RADIO SERIAL 
IT RAN FOR MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED EPISODES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS 
MAKE A DASH FOR IT KEEP ZIGZAGGING MAKE YOURSELF A DIFFICULT TARGET 
WHAT ABOUT YOU SIR NO GOOD BOTH OF US RUNNING TOGETHER I'LL FOLLOW READY YES SIR 
GIVE ME THE WORD GET READY IMAGINE YOU'RE RUNNING IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES GOOD LUCK SNOWY 
HE WAS A SPECIAL AGENT HE WAS A PRIVATE EYE 
AND WENT ROUND BIFFING VILLAINS 
PUNCHED THEM ON THE JAW BECAUSE THIS WAS STIFF UPPER LIP STUFF 
IT SOUNDS QUAINT NOW BUT I THINK IT HAD ITS TONGUE IN ITS CHEEK THEN BUT IT WAS SUPERB 
I CAN REMEMBER LISTENING TO DICK BARTON WITH MY BROTHER AND BEING ENORMOUSLY EXCITED BY IT 
IF YOU LISTEN TO ARCHIVE RECORDINGS OF IT 
IT REALLY IS THE MOST CRUDE KIND OF ADVENTURE STORY 
BUT AT THE TIME IT WAS DONE WITH SUCH MELODRAMA AND SUCH TERRIFIC PANACHE 
THAT IT CARRIED YOU ALONG 
RIGHT 
DO IT SNOWY 
GOOD MAN 
HE'S MADE IT 
IT HAD THAT DEDDLE DE DEN DE DE DE DEN TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING THEME SONG 
THAT'S BECOME THE WATCHWORD FOR MELODRAMA 
WELL I GOT THAT OUT REPEAT 
HERE THEY COME 
COME AWAY FROM THAT TRANSMITTER OR I SHOOT THE GIRL WE'VE HAD IT 
BUT EVENTUALLY DICK BARTON'S COVER WAS BLOWN 
AND IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE IT WAS REPLACED BY A PROGRAMME 
THAT WAS TO BECOME THE NATION'S FAVOURITE SOAP OPERA 
SET IN THE FICTIONAL VILLAGE OF AMBRIDGE THE ARCHERS TOLD THE STORIES OF ORDINARY COUNTRY FOLK 
BUT THE DRAMA WAS LEAVENED WITH AGRICULTURAL ADVICE 
IN THE HOPE THAT IT WOULD HELP FARMERS TO BUMP UP FOOD PRODUCTION 
I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU ABOUT THE PLACE PERMANENTLY LIKE THAT 
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO WORK WELL YOU'D NEED A NEW OUTFIT EVERY WEEK 
I WASN'T PROPOSING TO START THIS MORNING OH 
I MERELY WANTED TO BE FORMALLY INTRODUCED TO THE POULTRY 
THEN YOU CAN HAVE ME IN DUNGAREES AND A LEATHER JERKIN FAIR ENOUGH 
ALTHOUGH IT WAS AN ENTERTAINMENT IN MANY WAYS A SOAP OPERA 
THEY USED TO IMPART INFORMATION ALL THE TIME 
IT WAS LIKE A GUIDE TO FARMERS AN EDUCATION ABOUT NEW FARMING TECHNIQUES 
AND THAT WAS ALWAYS PUT INTO THE SCRIPTS 
SO THAT PERFECTLY FOLLOWED THE REITHIAN PRINCIPLES 
AND A PERFECT BIT OF B. B. C. RADIO FOR THE TIME 
IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH THE CENTRAL OFFICE OF INFORMATION THE GOVERNMENT P. R. OUTFIT AT THE TIME 
DECIDED IT HAD TO HAVE SOME WAY OF TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE OR WHAT TO ADD TO PIGSWILL 
THE INCOME TAX PROPOSAL IS THAT THE SINGLE ALLOWANCE SHALL BE INCREASED FROM ONE HUNDRED TEN TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
THERE IT IS THAT'S YOUR LOT 
A GOOD JOB WE GOT THAT HEAVY PLOUGHING DONE YES THAT LAKEY HILL JOB IS GOING TO COST A BIT MORE 
HOW IS THE NEW BANK RATE OF FOUR PER CENT GOING TO AFFECT THAT OVERDRAFT DAN 
I DON'T KNOW I BETTER SEE MY BANK MANAGER 
THIS SORT OF RADIO SOAP OPERA WHICH SEEMED TO BE ON ALL THE TIME 
JUST CAPTURED THE IMAGINATION OF THE LISTENING PUBLIC 
THEY LOVED IT THEY BELIEVED IN THE PEOPLE IT WAS THE CORONATION STREET OF ITS DAY 
THE POPULARITY OF THE ARCHERS CEMENTED RADIO'S POSITION 
AS BRITAIN'S PRE EMINENT MASS MEDIUM 
BY CONTRAST TELEVISION WAS STILL A MINORITY INTEREST 
THE SERVICE HAD BEEN TURNED OFF DURING THE WAR FOR FEAR THAT ITS V. H. F. SIGNAL MIGHT ATTRACT ENEMY BOMBERS 
WHEN T. V. RETURNED IN NINETEEN FORTY SIX THE B. B. C. WAS STILL THE MONOPOLY BROADCASTER 
BUT THE CORPORATION WAS MANAGED BY A GENERATION OF EXECUTIVES STEEPED IN THE TRADITIONS OF RADIO 
T. V. WAS EXPENSIVE FOR CONSUMERS AND UNDERFUNDED AND UNLOVED BY THOSE WHO CONTROLLED IT 
A IT WAS A VERY LIMITED RECEPTION AREA 
B. YOU HAD TO BE ENORMOUSLY RICH TO BE ABLE TO BUY A TELEVISION 
WHICH COST I THINK PROBABLY THE EQUIVALENT OF A CAR TODAY 
AND ALSO THE SERVICE WAS VERY LIMITED I MEAN THERE WERE VERY FEW HOURS THAT IT WENT OUT 
WHEN IT FIRST COMES BACK IN FORTY SIX YOU FIND IT'S A BIT LIKE IT WAS IN THE THIRTIES 
IT'S PRETTY STAID PRETTY SLOW 
HELLO EVERYBODY 
HERE I AM AGAIN 
ANOTHER LITTLE CHAT 
AND THIS TIME ON HATS 
THE DANISH BACON RATION IS NO LARGER THAN OURS OUR BUTTER RATION IS SMALLER 
I APPEAL TO ALL THOSE WHO USE THE ROADS 
TO REMEMBER TO USE THEM IN SUCH A SPIRIT 
THAT ACCIDENTS WILL BE AVOIDED 
IT WAS SEEN THEN AS BEING RADIO WITH PICTURES VERY LARGELY 
AND A LOT OF WHAT THEY DID WAS REALLY RADIO MODIFIED FOR TELEVISION 
THAT'S TWO GONE THAT EXCLUDES KISSING LADIES' HANDS 
THEY DID SOME QUIZ SHOWS THEY DID COOKERY QUITE EARLY ON 
ONE THING THAT THEY DID DO WHICH YOU COULDN'T DO ON RADIO WAS DANCING 
BUT THE ELEMENT IN THAT WHICH WAS IMPORTANT WAS THE MUSIC AND BANDS 
AND THAT TOO PLAYED A PART IN EARLY TELEVISION 
IN THE ABSENCE OF COMPETITION AND WITH NO CONCERN ABOUT RATINGS 
ALMOST ANY SUBJECT WAS DEEMED WORTHY OF T. V. AIRTIME 
I DID EVERYTHING SHORT STORIES GARDENING POLITICAL PROGRAMMES QUIZZES 
KNITTING PROGRAMMES PROGRAMMES FOR WOMEN 
EPILOGUES AT THE END OF THE EVENING I DID SOME TRAVEL PROGRAMMES 
THE KNITTING PROGRAMME BASICALLY TEACHING MEN HOW TO KNIT 
IT WAS DONE AS PART OF THE WOMEN'S PROGRAMMING DURING THE AFTERNOON 
KNITTING HAD BEEN A GREAT THING MEN KNITTED DURING THE WAR 
YOU KNITTED ON BOARD SHIPS 
SAILORS KNITTED 
AND THERE'S A LOT TO KNITTING 
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT PATTERNS 
AND JAMES NORBURY CAME UP AND KNITTED 
AND SHOWED HOW TO MAKE COMPLEX THINGS IT HAD A VERY GOOD AUDIENCE 
NOW DON'T BE SHOCKED WHEN YOU SEE THIS 
LOOK AT THAT 
FALLING TO PIECES 
AS AN INFANT MEDIUM ITSELF 
TELEVISION TRIED TO ESTABLISH ITSELF BY WINNING OVER THE YOUNG 
IN THE LATE NINETEEN FORTIES THE B. B. C. BROADCAST THREE HOURS OF CHILDREN'S PROGRAMMES A DAY 
MANY OF THE T. V. CHARACTERS DEVELOPED IN THIS PERIOD BECAME HOUSEHOLD NAMES 
INCLUDING MUFFIN THE MULE PRESENTED BY JOHN MILLS'S SISTER ANNETTE 
WE WANT MUFFIN MUFFIN THE MULE 
SHE USED TO SING AT THE PIANO SHE WAS REALLY A SINGER 
AND SHE BROUGHT MUFFIN IN WHILE SHE WAS PLAYING THE PIANO AND SINGING 
OOH IT'S HEAVY PULL 
PULL 
PULL 
OH 
OH WE'VE CAUGHT PEREGRINE OH DEAR 
IT WAS LIKE A KINDLY AUNT BEING IN THE ROOM THERE WAS NO THREAT HERE 
IT WAS VERY CALMING VERY CALM SHOWS 
HELLO TEDDY 
HELLO 
LOOK AT THIS GREAT BIG BOX 
OH FLOB B. A. BOB BOB TA BLOB DE BLOB 
OH HO HO HO HO 
AND LATER ON WHEN WATCH WITH MOTHER COMES ALONG 
A DIRECT DESCENDANT OF LISTEN WITH MOTHER IT'S THE SAME THING 
TILL NEXT TIME GOODBYE 
HOWEVER INNOCENT THE PROGRAMMING THE GOVERNMENT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT ITS IMPACT ON FAMILY LIFE 
THEY INSISTED THAT THE B. B. C. SHUT DOWN ITS T. V. SERVICE BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN P. M. 
ALLOWING PARENTS TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN TO BED 
THE ARRANGEMENT BECAME KNOWN AS THE TODDLERS' TRUCE 
THE TRANSMITTERS LITERALLY CLOSED DOWN 
SO THAT PARENTS COULD PUT TO BED THEIR TODDLERS 
WITHOUT BEING BADGERED TO BE ALLOWED TO WATCH MORE BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE SEEN 
IT WAS THE B. B. C. SAYING WE'LL CLOSE DOWN YOU PUT THE CHILDREN TO BED 
THEN WE'LL COME BACK ON THE AIR AGAIN EXTRAORDINARY 
B. B. C. TELEVISION EXECUTIVES WANTED TO PROVIDE THE SAME RANGE OF PROGRAMMES OFFERED BY RADIO 
BUT THE TECHNOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES AND THE COSTS WERE IMMENSE 
CAMERAS ARE CUMBERSOME THERE'S NOT MUCH MOVEMENT 
THERE'S NO VIDEOTAPES ALL TELEVISION GOES OUT LIVE 
AND SOMETIMES THERE'D BE MISTAKES 
ANYBODY MIGHT THINK YOU WERE GOING FOR GOOD IT'S A BUNGALOW AND WE'RE TAKING OUR OWN LINEN 
THE CAMERAS BROKE DOWN VERY REGULARLY 
AND AS A TELEVISION DIRECTOR YOU MIGHT WELL START OFF WITH THREE CAMERAS 
OR IF YOU ARE VERY LUCKY FOUR IN A STUDIO 
AND WOULD MAYBE LOSE ONE OF THEM 
JUST SIMPLY IT'D STOP WORKING 
HALFWAY THROUGH THE SHOW 
YOU'D LOOK OUT OF THE STUDIO GALLERY AND SEE MEN IN BROWN COATS TAKING OUT VALVES AND PUTTING THEM BACK IN 
SO YOU WERE IMPROVISING IT WAS IT WAS UM VERY ROUGH AND READY 
BUT IT HAD AN IMMEDIACY IT HAD A HUGE EXCITEMENT 
DESPITE ALL THE TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS THE B. B. C.'S T. V. SERVICE 
ROSE TO ITS GREATEST EVER CHALLENGE WHEN IT COVERED THE LONDON OLYMPICS IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT 
THEY PROVIDED THREE AND A HALF HOURS OF LIVE BROADCASTS EVERY DAY 
MOSTLY WITHOUT A HITCH 
AS THE B. B. C.'S TELEVISION ARM DEVELOPED THEY APPLIED LESSONS LEARNED IN THEIR OUTSIDE BROADCASTS 
TO THEIR WORK IN THE STUDIO 
SOON THE SERVICE GREW IN COMPETENCE CONFIDENCE AND AMBITION 
TELEVISION BECAME A TALKING POINT 
AND AUDIENCES STARTED TO STAY IN 
TO VIEW THEIR FAVOURITE PROGRAMMES 
WATCHING TELEVISION WAS BECOMING AN EVENT 
THEY USED TO DO PLAY OF THE MONTH 
AT THAT TIME 
WHICH WERE VERY 
THEY WERE EXCELLENT DRAMATIC PRODUCTIONS 
EVEN YOU KNOW DESPITE THE PRIMITIVE CAMERA WORK AND SO ON 
BUT THEY WERE PLAYS IN THE SENSE THAT THEY HAD THREE ACTS WITH TWO INTERVALS 
AND DURING THE INTERVALS THEY WOULD PUT ON THINGS CALLED INTERLUDES 
WHICH WERE LITTLE EPISODES OF A POTTER'S WHEEL TURNING 
OR A STREAM RUNNING OVER COBBLES 
AND A MINUTE BEFORE THE END OF IT THEY WOULD RING A BELL 
SO IN OTHER WORDS THEY'D TRY TO DUPLICATE THE THEATRICAL EXPERIENCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 
AND IN RETURN QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE AT HOME 
USED TO PUT ON DINNER JACKETS TO WATCH IT 
THE B. B. C. IN THOSE DAYS 
FELT IT HAD AN OBLIGATION TO DO THE GREAT CATEGORY OF WORLD DRAMAS 
YOU WOULD SEE SHAKESPEARE DONE LIVE 
IT WAS THE LARK THE HERALD OF THE MORN 
NO NIGHTINGALE 
LOOK LOVE 
WHAT ENVIOUS STREAKS DO LACE THE SEVERING CLOUDS IN YONDER EAST 
NIGHT'S CANDLES ARE BURNT OUT AND JOCUND DAY 
STANDS TIPTOE ON THE MISTY MOUNTAINTOPS 
I MUST BE GONE 
YOU WATCHED A T. V. PLAY KNOWING IT WAS HAPPENING AT THAT TIME LENDING IT THEATRICAL TENSION AND EXCITEMENT 
YOU SAT ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SOFA AS IF YOU WERE IN A THEATRE STALL 
NOW MY DEAR LADY TEAZLE IF YOU WOULD BUT ONCE MAKE A TRIFLING FAUX PAS 
YOU CAN'T CONCEIVE HOW CAUTIOUS YOU WOULD GROW 
AND HOW READY TO HUMOUR 
AND AGREE WITH YOUR HUSBAND DO YOU THINK SO OH I'M SURE 
RADIO WAS SLOW TO RESPOND TO THE EMERGING THREAT POSED BY TELEVISION 
IN THE LATE FORTIES IT WAS STILL REACHING MASSIVE AUDIENCES WITH LONG ESTABLISHED PROGRAMMES 
INCLUDING A COMEDY SKETCH SHOW 
STARRING THE IRREPRESSIBLE LIVERPOOL COMEDIAN TOMMY HANDLEY 
INTENDED AS A REFERENCE TO HITLER 
THE SHOW WAS CALLED IT'S THAT MAN AGAIN 
BUT MILLIONS OF LISTENERS AFFECTIONATELY SHORTENED ITS NAME TO ITMA 
ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR WARTIME SERIES 
WHICH WAS FULL OF UM CATCHPHRASES 
FULL OF UM FAMILIAR CHARACTERS 
FULL OF THINGS WHICH PEOPLE HAD EXPERIENCE OF 
AND ACCEPTED 
GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING NICE DAY YES 
COULD I INTEREST YOU IN A LITTLE INSURANCE NO 
I'LL CALL AGAIN GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING NICE DAY YES 
ITMA MADE JOKES OF THINGS THAT WE WERE IN A SENSE SCARED OF 
BOMBS THE GERMANS BEING PART OF THE MILITARY 
SOME OF ITMA'S BEST REMEMBERED CHARACTERS WERE PARODIES OF STEREOTYPICAL ARMY FIGURES 
FAMILIAR TO MILLIONS WHO'D SERVED DURING THE WAR 
I MUST GET THAT BOX MADE LARGER 
LAGER I DON'T MIND IF I DO 
WHATEVER YOU SAID BECAME A SORT OF DOUBLE ENTENDRE FOR A DRINK 
A LARGE ONE I DON'T MIND IF I DO 
IT WAS THE FAST SHOW OF ITS DAY COS IT WAS BUILT ON CATCHPHRASES 
ECCENTRIC CHARACTERS KEPT COMING IN 
THE DOOR BANGED THROUGHOUT THAT SHOW CHARACTERS KEPT COMING IN WITH THEIR CATCHPHRASES 
AND EVERYONE USED THE CATCHPHRASES 
DO YOU HAVE A CHAPERONE OOH YES SIR 
AND A VERY NICE POLITE CHAP HE WAS TOO 
ALWAYS SAID PARDON BEFORE HE TOOK HIS BOOTS OFF 
I'D HATE TO HEAR WHAT HE SAID BEFORE HE TOOK HIS SOCKS OFF 
THE PUBLIC DEMAND FOR RADIO COMEDIES 
DREW MANY PERFORMERS WHO'D RECENTLY BEEN DEMOBBED FROM THE SERVICES 
GUNNER MILLIGAN YOU'VE BEEN ACTING LIKE A COWARD 
NO SIR NOT TRUE I'M A HERO WITH COWARD'S LEGS 
THE DEMAND FOR NEW MATERIAL FOR COMICS WAS ENORMOUS 
FOR PERFORMERS AND WRITERS IT WAS BOOM TIME 
WHEN THE WARTIME COMEDIANS CAME HOME AND SOUGHT WORK 
A LOT OF THEM DID GET JOBS ON RADIO 
WHEN THEY WENT ON RADIO 
RADIO LIKE TELEVISION LATER HAD BECOME AN ENORMOUS EATER OF MATERIAL 
SO BEFORE THE WAR 
THE COMEDIANS COULD HAVE HAD A TWENTY TO THIRTY MINUTE ACT 
WHICH THEY COULD TOUR WITH FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS BEFORE HAVING TO CHANGE THEIR ACT 
BUT ONCE THEY WERE ON RADIO IT WAS EATING UP MATERIAL 
THEY HAD TO CHANGE THE MATERIAL A LOT AND THUS THE COMEDY WRITER IS BORN 
MEETING THIS DEMAND WAS ONE OF THE ERA'S MOST PROLIFIC COMEDY WRITING TEAMS 
FRANK MUIR AND DENNIS NORDEN MET IN THE R. A. F. 
AND IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN THEY CREATED TAKE IT FROM HERE 
A COMEDY SKETCH SHOW THAT RAN FOR TWELVE YEARS 
TAKE IT FROM HERE 
DON'T GO AWAY WHEN YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE 
WERE THE BOYS RUNNING OUT OF THE CLASSROOM 
OR BOLTING INTO ASSEMBLY HALL SHOW THEM IT'S MORNING 
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WORKED SO WELL TOGETHER 
WE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFERENT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY 
ERM 
EVEN AFTER WE WENT SEPARATE WAYS WE WOULD TALK TO EACH OTHER THREE OR FOUR TIMES A DAY 
WE WERE I MEAN 
I MISS HIM NOW IT WAS LIKE AN AMPUTATION WHEN HE DIED 
TAKE IT FROM HERE WAS IN A SENSE AN OLD FASHIONED BIT PART SHOW 
WHAT'S SOMETIMES CALLED BROKEN COMEDY 
WHICH IS WHERE YOU HAVE A HALF HOUR SHOW WHICH HAS A SONG A JOKE A SKETCH 
SEVERAL CHARACTERS WHO ARE FAMILIAR TO THE AUDIENCE AND SO ON 
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT BENTLEY WHAT IS THIS ALL LEADING UP TO 
JIM WE'VE GOT TO HAVE PATHOS 
THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES COMEDIANS LOVEABLE 
WE'RE ALL RIGHT BUT WE'RE JUST NOT LOVEABLE 
ARE YOU 
ONE OF THEIR MOST POPULAR SPEECHES FEATURED THE GLUMS 
A DYSFUNCTIONAL WORKING CLASS FAMILY 
WHICH INTRODUCED THE NATION TO A YOUNG ACTRESS JUNE WHITFIELD 
OH RON 
I'M NOT GOING ON A HONEYMOON WITH YOUR DAD ALONG 
BUT E. T. H. THREE IS MORE COMPANY AT THE SEASIDE 
YOU CAN'T PLAY BEACH CRICKET WITHOUT A WICKET KEEPER 
TAKE IT FROM HERE 
DON'T GO AWAY 
I JOINED TAKE IT FROM HERE IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE 
AND WHEN I STARTED THE GLUMS FAMILY STARTED 
AND THIS WAS AN APPALLING FAMILY 
WRITTEN BY FRANK MUIR AND DENNIS NORDEN 
AND THEY WROTE IT AS AN ANTIDOTE 
TO ALL THE COSY SITCOMS THAT WERE ON THE RADIO AT THE TIME 
PA GLUM WAS PLAYED BY JIMMY EDWARDS 
RON HIS THICK AS TWO PLANKS SON WAS PLAYED BY DICK BENTLEY 
AND THERE WAS RON'S EVER LOVING FIANCEE E. T. H. THAT WAS ME 
RON IT'S ME E. T. H. 
IT IS A DEPICTION OF A WORKING CLASS FAMILY AND THAT WAS UNUSUAL FOR RADIO AT THE TIME 
THE BROAD COCKNEY ACCENT OF JIMMY EDWARDS IT PERHAPS SOUNDS EARTHIER THAN IT REALLY IS 
AND IT WAS UNUSUAL FOR RADIO AT THE TIME 
PEOPLE WERE USED TO MORE B. B. C. ACCENTS YOU KNOW 
THEY DIDN'T WANT THIS LOWER CLASS CURMUDGEONLY OAF SPOUTING AT THEM 
MOTHER I'M TAKING YOU AWAY FOR A WEEK'S HOLIDAY 
OH WELL PERHAPS IT WASN'T QUITE THE RIGHT MOMENT TO GIVE HER A SUDDEN SURPRISE 
I JUST REMEMBERED WHERE SHE WAS WHERE MR. GLUM 
GETTING THE MANGLE DOWN FROM THE LOFT 
THE ONE WHO ROOTED THE WHOLE THING IN REALITY WAS E. T. H. JUNE WHITFIELD 
SHE WAS A MASS OF CRAVINGS AND URGES 
BUT THAT WAS OUR SECRET BECAUSE WE NEVER GAVE VOICE TO IT 
SO WE USED TO DESCRIBE IT IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS 
DRIVING WITH ONE FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND ONE FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR 
GETTING A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND NOT BEING ABLE TO OPEN IT TILL EASTER THAT SORT OF THING 
SOME GIRLS MAY LIKE A QUILTED EFFECT BUT NOT ME RON 
GIVE ME A FRILL RIGHT O. E. T. H. 
TAKE IT FROM HERE WAS A FAR MORE SHARP EDGY SERIES 
WHICH ATTEMPTED TO PUSH BOUNDARIES 
IT WAS QUITE INTERESTED IN DOUBLE ENTENDRE 
IT WAS QUITE INTERESTED IN SLIPPING THINGS PAST THE B. B. C. CENSOR 
BUT THE B. B. C. CENSORS WERE FORMIDABLE OPPONENTS 
THEY WERE GUIDED BY DRACONIAN REGULATIONS 
SET OUT IN THE CORPORATION'S SO CALLED GREEN BOOK 
WHICH IDENTIFIED WHAT WAS ACCEPTABLE FOR BROADCAST 
ON THE NATION'S AIRWAVES 
PROGRAMMES MUST BE KEPT FREE OF CRUDITIES COARSENESS AND INNUENDO 
MUST NOT USE UNDERWEAR I. E. WINTER DRAWERS ON 
SUGGESTIVE REFERENCES TO HONEYMOON COUPLES CHAMBERMAIDS FIG LEAVES PROSTITUTION 
BUT IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES YOU WANTED TO GO A BIT FURTHER 
JOKES ABOUT LAVATORIES EFFEMINACY IN MEN IMMORALITY OF ANY KIND 
SO YOU HAD TO EXERCISE INGENUITY 
I TELL YOU WHAT IT'S LIKE THE TAX LAWS 
ANIMAL RABBITS EG RABBITS WHICH I THINK IS WONDERFUL 
LODGERS AND COMMERCIAL TRAVELLERS 
ONCE THEY CODIFY THE TAX LAWS AND WRITE THEM DOWN AS RULES 
YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET LOOPHOLES 
EXTREME CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN IN DEALING WITH REFERENCES TO OR JOKES ABOUT 
PRE NATAL INFLUENCES EG HIS MOTHER WAS FRIGHTENED BY A DONKEY 
WE WANT MUFFIN 
MUFFIN THE MULE 
DEAR OLD MUFFIN 
THERE WAS A SONG AT THE TIME CALLED I KISS YOUR PRETTY HAND MADAME 
SO WE HAD IT SUNG AS I KISS YOUR 
AND DAINTY SLAP SLAP SLAP 
D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. MADAME 
I JUST ADORE YOUR SLAP 
YOU KNOW WITH A TIMP YOU SEE 
WELL WE GOT HAULED 
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D EVER LITERALLY BEEN ON THE CARPET 
COS WE GOT HAULED IN FRONT OF THE DIRECTOR OF LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT 
AND WE HAD TO STAND ON THE CARPET IN FRONT OF HIS DESK 
HE DIDN'T TELL US TO SIT DOWN FOR BEING UNBELIEVABLY OBSCENE 
AND WE SAID WELL WHAT DID WE DO 
AND HE SAID 
YOU KNOW THIS PUTS ALL SORTS OF IDEAS INTO PEOPLE'S HEADS 
BUT WE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING 
IF YOU PUT TWO DIRTY JOKES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE THEY LEAP OFF THE PAGE 
SO THEY SAY YOU'RE NOT DOING THOSE AND WE SAY VERY SORRY OF COURSE WE WON'T 
BUT IT'S A SMOKESCREEN COS THEY HAVEN'T NOTICED THE OTHER ONE AT THE TOP 
THE B. B. C. PRESENTS PETER SANDLERS HARRY SETON AND SPOT MERRICAN IN 
THE GONG SHOW 
BY THE END OF THE FORTIES 
RADIO HAD BEEN INVADED BY A GENERATION OF PERFORMERS 
WHO HAD LITTLE RESPECT FOR B. B. C. IMPOSED STANDARDS OF DECORUM 
THE MOST SUSTAINED ASSAULT ON THE GREEN BOOK WAS LAUNCHED IN NINETEEN FIFTY 
WHEN THE EX ARMY ENTERTAINERS PETER SELLERS HARRY SECOMBE AND MICHAEL BENTINE 
JOINED THE SCRIPTWRITER SPIKE MILLIGAN 
TO CREATE A RADIO COMEDY SERIES ENTITLED CRAZY PEOPLE 
SUBVERSIVE AND WILFULLY ANTI ESTABLISHMENT 
THE SHOW FEATURED BIZARRE PLOTS AND A SURREAL SOUNDSCAPE 
IT WOULD LATER BECOME BETTER KNOWN AS THE GOONS 
WHAT TIME IS IT ECCLES 
JUST A MINUTE I'VE GOT IT WRITTEN DOWN HERE ON A PIECE OF PAPER 
A NICE MAN WROTE THE TIME DOWN FOR ME THIS MORNING 
OH THEN WHY DO YOU CARRY IT AROUND WITH YOU LIKE THAT 
WELL ERM ER IF ANYBODY ASKS ME THE TIME 
THE GOONS FIRST OF ALL USED RADIO 
IN A WAY THAT LEFT US ABSOLUTELY GAPING WITH ADMIRATION 
THE WAY THAT THEY USED SOUND EFFECTS PAUSES DOORS OPENING 
AND GOT LAUGHS SIMPLY FROM THAT PLUS IT HAD 
THAT WIDE RANGING MIND OF SPIKE MILLIGAN 
I REMEMBER ON ONE OF HIS BIRTHDAYS WHEN HE SAYS 
ANYBODY CAN BE FIFTY TWO 
BUT IT TAKES A BUS TO BE FIFTY TWO B. 
MY HUSBAND'S JUST BEEN SHOT 
I'VE JUST COME INTO THE FRONT ROOM AND FOUND HIM LYING ON THE CARPET 
OH IS HE DEAD I THINK SO 
HADN'T YOU BETTER MAKE SURE 
ALL RIGHT JUST A MINUTE 
HE'S DEAD 
THE ARMY HUMOUR WAS SOLIDLY BASED ON DISRESPECT FOR AUTHORITY 
THEY WERE QUITE A REBELLIOUS LOT WHEN THEY CAME OUT 
BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY WERE ENTITLED TO BEHAVE LIKE THAT COS THEY MIGHT GET KILLED 
THE GOONS CAME TOGETHER WITH THEIR OWN FORM OF EX SERVICEMEN'S HUMOUR 
WHICH WAS ANTI AUTHORITARIAN 
AGAINST THE OFFICER CLASS THE GOVERNMENT EVERYBODY 
THERE WAS A DEMENTED AIR ABOUT IT 
THE STRENGTH OF THE GOONS COMES FROM THE FACT 
THAT BY HAVING SUCH A COMPLETELY CHAOTIC AND ANARCHIC APPROACH TO WHAT THEY WERE DOING 
THEY GOT AWAY WITH THINGS THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GOT AWAY WITH IN AN EXPLICIT SENSE 
SO THAT OFFICER CHARACTERS WERE OFTEN TOTALLY RIDICULOUS 
EACH COMMANDO OH IS ISSUED 
WHEN HE MEETS A HUN FULL FACE 
IT'S WHOOSH PAT NUKPANOORL 
SPIKE MILLIGAN HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN FIGHTING THE WAR 
DIDN'T LIKE OR BELIEVE IN IT WAS BASICALLY A PACIFIST IF YOU LOOK AT HIS RECORD 
AND WHO TOOK THE ATTITUDE THAT IT ALL NEEDED SHAKING UP THINGS NEEDED TO BE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW 
WHEN THIS IS OVER WE WON'T GO ON LIKE THAT ANY MORE 
THE CHAOS THE ANARCHY OVERCAME THE AUTHORITARIAN ATTITUDES 
WHICH GOVERNED THAT KIND OF THING GOING OUT FROM THE B. B. C. 
SO THAT THEY GOT BY IT BY SIMPLY BEING COMPLETELY CHAOTIC 
BUT WHY USE SPAGHETTI 
DON'T YOU SEE YOU MILITARY FOOL 
WHEN A GERMAN IS STRUCK WITH THE FULL FORCE OF SPAGHETTI 
HE'LL THINK THE ITALIANS HAVE TURNED ON THEM YOU SEE 
SOME OF THE ANTI ESTABLISHMENT NATURE OF THE GOONS 
IS WHAT REALLY SHOCKED AUDIENCES AT HOME 
AND EVEN LISTENING TO THE AUDIENCE IN THE STUDIO 
YOU CAN TELL THAT LAUGHTER IS ONE OF JUST AMAZEMENT THAT THEY'RE BOLD ENOUGH TO GET AWAY WITH THIS STUFF 
THAT SOMETIMES THE LANGUAGE THOUGH NEVER OBSCENE 
SEEMS TO BE MOVING INTO AREAS THAT WERE PERHAPS CONSIDERED UNSAVOURY IN THE PAST 
GET YOUR HANDS AWAY FROM ME ECCLES 
HOW CAN I MISTAKE YOU FOR MARILYN MONROE 
I'VE GOT AIR BUBBLES IN THE SEAT OF MY TROUSERS' 
HAVING COME FROM A WARTIME SITUATION THE THINGS THAT MADE THEM LAUGH 
WERE SOMETIMES CRUDE WERE SOMETIMES RUDE 
WERE CERTAINLY BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED ON RADIO 
THEY MANAGED TO GET SOME OF IT OVER ALMOST ESOTERICALLY 
BY USING SLANG THAT THE CENSORS DIDN'T GET 
OTHERWISE THERE WOULD BE A BATTLE WITH THE BLUE PENCIL BRIGADE 
IT'S NOT AS IF THEY THREW THE RULEBOOK OUT THE WINDOW 
BUT THEY TORE PAGES OUT OF IT 
THE GOONS BLAZED A TRAIL 
INTO PREVIOUSLY UNCHARTED REGIONS OF SURREALIST COMEDY 
MORE CONVENTIONAL AN APPROACH BUT JUST AS POPULAR 
WAS THE WORK OF ONE OF RADIO'S EMERGING STARS 
A CHARACTER WHO HAD BRITAIN LAUGHING AT SOCIAL CONVENTIONS AND HIS OWN INADEQUACIES 
NO THANK YOU THERE'S A COUPLE OF 'EM OUT THERE WITH CROWBARS' 
I'VE GOTTA STOP HERE TILL THEY ALL GO HOME I'LL BE WEEKS I'M TRAPPED 
TRAPPED DO YOU HEAR 
TRAPPED 
I 
I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE ONE OF ME TURNS 
DURING HIS SERVICE IN THE WAR 
TONY HANCOCK HAD PERFORMED WITH THE R. A. F. ENTERTAINMENT TROOP THE GANG SHOW 
AFTER BEING DEMOBBED IN NINETEEN FORTY SIX HE TOURED THE COMEDY CIRCUIT 
AND WAS SOON PICKED UP BY B. B. C. RADIO 
WHO TEAMED HIM UP WITH THE YOUNG WRITING PARTNERSHIP OF RAY GALTON AND ALAN SIMPSON 
FIRST THOUGHTS FOR THE SHOW WERE NO JOKES AND NO CATCHPHRASES 
CHARACTER AND SITUATION THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED 
BUT IT HAD TO COME OUT OF THE WRITING AND THE STORY 
AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN IT 
WE SHARED THE SAME SENSE OF HUMOUR IN OUR WRITING 
AND HIS PERFORMANCE GELLED PERFECTLY 
WE WERE TRYING TO GET THE CHARACTER GRADUALLY MORE REALISTIC 
AND TONY I THINK SAW WHAT WE WERE DOING 
AND JOINED IN AND GRADUALLY THE PERFORMANCE CHANGED 
ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE PROFESSIONAL WRITERS WRITING 
THEN COMEDIANS ARE TAKEN INTO AREAS THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GONE INTO THEMSELVES 
GALTON AND SIMPSON WRITE FOR TONY HANCOCK 
THEY WRITE A CHARACTER PERHAPS SLIGHTLY BASED ON HANCOCK'S OWN CHARACTER 
BUT THEY EXTEND HIM AND MOVE HIM INTO DIFFERENT AREAS 
LEAVE THIS TO ME THERE'LL PROBABLY BE A FIGHT 
IF THINGS START GETTING TOUGH PROMISE ME YOU'LL GO TO MY CABIN 
LOCK THE DOOR AND GET UNDER THE TABLE WHY 
THAT'S WHERE I'LL BE 
THERE'S A MELANCHOLY ABOUT THE WRITING OF GALTON AND SIMPSON 
WHICH IMBUES HANCOCK WITH ALL SORTS OF SHADES OF DARKNESS 
IN MANY WAYS WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS WRITING THE FIRST ADULT COMEDY 
TELEVISION EXECUTIVES WERE KEEN TO EXPLOIT HANCOCK'S SUCCESS ON RADIO 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX GALTON AND SIMPSON PIONEERED THE TRANSFER OF COMEDIANS 
FROM RADIO TO TELEVISION 
HANCOCK'S HALF HOUR WAS THE BEGINNING OF A TREND 
THAT HAS CONTINUED TO THIS DAY 
NATIONALITY 
AH YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THERE 
IT'S THE BLOOD YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ISN'T IT BRITISH BRITISH 
UNDILUTED FOR TWELVE GENERATIONS 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT ANGLO SAXON WITH PERHAPS JUST A DASH OF VIKING 
NOTHING ELSE HAS CREPT IN NO 
ANYBODY WHO GETS ANY OF THIS WILL HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT 
THERE'S ARISTOCRACY IN THERE YOU KNOW 
YOU WANT TO WATCH WHO YOU'RE GIVING IT TO 
I THINK HE WAS THE BEST COMIC ACTOR WE'VE SEEN HE HAD AN AMAZING PERSONALITY 
OF COURSE HE WAS THE ARCHETYPAL LOSER 
WINNERS ARE VERY BORING SUCCESS IS BORING 
BUT THE PRETENTIOUS LOSER YOU KNOW HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT 
BUT HE'S ENDLESSLY STRIVING AND FULL OF HIMSELF 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT HANCOCK WAS THAT IT WAS AN INTERNALISED MONOLOGUE ABOUT HIS STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
SO IT EMBODIED ALL HIS PETTY AMBITIONS AND HIS MINOR SNOBBERIES 
AND WE RECOGNISE THEM WE MIGHT BE RATHER ASHAMED OF THEM BUT WE 
AND SO FOR THE FIRST TIME IT OPENED UP THE INTERIOR LIFE OF A CHARACTER 
WITH WHICH WE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED AND SYMPATHISED 
BUT THEN WE STAYED TO MOCK 
AND WE WERE MOCKING OUR OWN FRAILTY 
AH THE INTREPID BIRDMAN 
WELL WHAT'S HAPPENING WHAT'S WRONG TROUBLE WITH THE LIFT ANYBODY 
ANYBODY PRESSED THE BUTTON DEAR OH DEAR THE MILITARY MIND OF COURSE 
WHAT DO THINK WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO PULL IT UP BY THE ROPE LET ME HAVE A GO 
PERHAPS YOU HAVEN'T PRESSED IT HARD ENOUGH YOU HAVE A GO PRETEND IT'S A ROCKET YOU'D ENJOY THAT 
THE AIR MARSHAL PRESSES THE BUTTON TONY LOOKS UP AT THE BOARD NO STILL ON THE LAUNCHING PAD 
HANCOCK'S NEW SERIES WAS AS POPULAR ON TELEVISION 
AS IT WAS ON RADIO 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE TWENTY TWO MILLION VIEWERS HAD CROWDED ROUND TELEVISIONS 
TO WATCH THE CORONATION AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY 
IT PROVED TO BE A TIPPING POINT 
SALES OF TELEVISIONS SOARED 
FOR THE FIRST TIME 
TELEVISION HAD ACHIEVED A BIGGER AUDIENCE THAN RADIO 
AS A MASS MEDIUM T. V. HAD COME OF AGE 
THAT WAS A CLIMACTIC MOMENT THAT WAS THE MOMENT WHEN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION CHANGED 
OR CERTAINLY THE HISTORY OF THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS BOTH SEEN AND ORGANISED 
WHEN SUDDENLY 
THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME WHEN TELEVISION 
WITNESSED AN IMPORTANT NATIONAL EVENT 
AND ENABLED THE ENTIRE NATION TO PARTICIPATE 
AND THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED EVER 
EVER BEFORE 
AND IT WAS A UNIFYING EXPERIENCE 
HALF THE STREET CAME IN TO WATCH THE CORONATION 
IN BLACK AND WHITE ON THIS SMALL TWELVE INCH SCREEN 
WHICH WAS A VERY LARGE SCREEN THEN COS THE AVERAGE WAS NINE INCHES 
AND PEOPLE SAY IT WAS THE CORONATION ITSELF THAT SOLD SETS AND PUSHED THE MEDIUM 
INTO THE NEXT ERA 
TELEVISION IS NOW IT IF THERE HAD EVER BEEN ANY DOUBT 
THAT REALLY THE B. B. C.'S STRENGTH WAS RADIO 
IT WAS NOW QUITE APPARENT FROM NOW ON 
THAT TELEVISION WAS THE OVERRIDING FORCE OF THE B. B. C. BY WHICH IT WOULD BE JUDGED 
AND BY WHICH IT WOULD BECOME POPULAR 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES 
THAT WOULD HELP TO ESTABLISH A GENRE 
THAT HAS BECOME ONE OF THE STAPLES OF PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTING 
A YOUNG B. B. C. PRODUCER 
DAVID ATTENBOROUGH PRESENTED ZOO QUEST 
A LIVE STUDIO PROGRAMME 
WITH FILMED INSERTS 
IT BROUGHT STRANGE ANIMALS AND NEW WORLDS 
INTO BRITISH LIVING ROOMS 
OF ALL THE ANIMALS THAT WE BROUGHT BACK NOT ON THIS EXPEDITION 
BUT ON THE PREVIOUS ONE IN WEST AFRICA 
I MYSELF HAVE GOT A VERY SOFT SPOT 
FOR ONE PARTICULAR ONE THAT WE CAUGHT IN AFRICA 
IT WAS VERY DIDACTIC IT WAS VERY BORING WELL YEAH IT WAS BORING I GUESS 
BUT WHAT WAS EXCITING ABOUT IT WAS THAT AT LEAST THE ANIMALS WERE LIVE 
BUT THEY STILL LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY WERE FREAKS SITTING ON A TABLE MAT ON A TABLE 
SO I THOUGHT WHY COULDN'T WE ACTUALLY SHOW THAT THEY'RE NOT FREAKS 
BY FILMING THEM OVERSEAS 
THIS WAS TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING FOR US 
OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THIS MAGNIFICENT MONSTER 
THE CLIMAX OF FOUR MONTHS OF ARDUOUS TRAVEL 
ONE OF THE CREATURES THAT WE BROUGHT BACK FROM WEST AFRICA 
WAS A LITTLE BABY CHIMP 
WHICH HAD BEEN SOMEBODY'S PET IN WEST AFRICA 
WE DIDN'T CATCH HER HER NAME WAS JANE 
JANE MADE AN INSTANT HIT I MEAN I KNEW HER VERY WELL 
WE WERE HER FRIENDS I MEAN SHE WAS AN ENCHANTING CREATURE 
TO MY ENORMOUS RELIEF THEY GREETED ME NOT FIERCELY BUT WITH CONSIDERABLE ENTHUSIASM 
LAUGHING AT MYSELF 
I DISCOVERED THAT THIS IN FACT IS MERELY THE NORMAL NEW GUINEA WELCOME 
THEY WERE KEEN TO LEARN THINGS AND THEY SAW THE B. B. C. 
AS SHOWING THEM A WORLD THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT 
SO THEY TURNED TO THE B. B. C. FOR INFORMATION 
AND ENTERTAINMENT TOO 
BUT THEY WERE REALLY GREEDY HUNGRY 
FOR FACTS AND DETAILS 
AND TO BE SHOWN AN ANIMAL TO BE SHOWN AN ANIMAL ON A SCREEN 
AND POSSIBLY WITH ANOTHER ANIMAL NOT MATING YET I DON'T THINK WE DIDN'T DO THAT 
BUT TO SEE EXOTIC CREATURES WAS REALLY THRILLING 
TO FOLLOW UP ITS SUCCESS WITH WILDLIFE 
TELEVISION APED A SUCCESSFUL RADIO FORMAT 
THE SOAP OPERA 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR THE B. B. C. PRODUCED THE GROVE FAMILY 
FEATURING A HARD WORKING FAMILY STRUGGLING TO ACHIEVE FINANCIAL STABILITY 
AFTER YEARS OF AUSTERITY 
IT ATTRACTED A DEVOTED AUDIENCE OF NINE MILLION VIEWERS 
I HAVEN'T STARTED COS I'M EXPECTING A VISIT FROM THE POLICE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOTHING 
AND WHAT ARE YOU AFTER THE TILL I WANTED TO BORROW YOUR CRICKET PADS THE GROVE FAMILY WAS 
ONE CAN TAKE IT THAT IT WAS THE FORERUNNER OF ALL SOAPS AS WE KNOW THEM NOWADAYS 
JUST BOWL AT ME I CAN'T BOWL 
YOU CAN THROW CAN'T YOU I SUPPOSE SO WELL O. K. THEN 
I WAS CHEEKY LITTLE 
LENNIE GROVE 
YOUR FRONT DOOR IS FITTED WITH AN ORDINARY SPRING LOCK YES AND HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS H. M. M. 
YOU DON'T THINK MUCH OF 'EM NO THEY'RE NOT VERY GOOD 
THERE WAS ONE PARTICULAR EPISODE I CAN REMEMBER ABOUT BURGLARY 
THERE WAS MY DAD PROMOTING THE SALE OF A CERTAIN TYPE OF LOCK 
WHICH YOU SHOULD SECURE YOUR HOUSE WITH 
DO YOU KNOW IT OH YES I KNOW THAT TYPE THIS IS QUITE A DIFFERENT KETTLE OF FISH 
EVEN A JEMMY WON'T BUDGE THESE 
NOW THIS IS THE RIGHT TYPE TO HAVE 
YOU SEEN THEY'VE GOT THE STEEL INSERTS ON THE BOLT 
AND FIVE CLEVERLY CONCEALED LEVERS 
AND WE HAD A BURGLAR WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY 
ALL HE MISSED WAS THE BLACK MASK AND THE SWAG BAG 
BUT YOU KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON 
AND IT WAS JUST GETTING OVER TO THEM TO BE MORE SECURE CONSCIOUS 
IT WAS NEW IT WAS 
STRAIGHT OFF THE DRAWING BOARD 
HEY THERE'S THIS FAMILY THAT LIVES SOMEWHERE THAT IS SIMILAR TO WHERE WE LIVE 
AND THEY'RE A FAMILY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE ARE 
AND SEE THE THINGS THEY GET UP TO SO LET'S GO AND WATCH THEM EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT WHICH IS WHAT WE DID 
YOU SEEM TO HAVE A FUNNY IDEA WHAT I'M HERE FOR 
IF YOU THINK I'M RISKING A BROKEN HEAD FOR A PEEP AT YOUR SCANTIES 
YOU CAN CATCH YOUR OWN BURGLARS AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU 
IN THOSE DAYS YOU WOULD NEVER COVER THE SUBJECTS THAT WE COVER NOW AND TALK OPENLY ABOUT 
ABOUT SEX DRUGS 
VIOLENCE 
ALTHOUGH TELEVISION DIDN'T COVER EARTHY SUBJECTS 
IT DID MANAGE TO THRILL AUDIENCES BY INTRODUCING THEM TO VISITORS 
FROM OTHER WORLDS 
WRITTEN BY NIGEL KNEALE 
THE SCI FI THRILLER QUATERMASS TOLD THE STORY OF AN ASTRONAUT 
WHO RETURNED FROM SPACE WITH SOME UNWELCOME PASSENGERS 
IT WAS ONE OF TELEVISION'S EARLIEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORAYS 
INTO THE WORLD OF SPECIAL EFFECTS 
A BIG CHANGE COMES WITH QUATERMASS 
A HORROR SERIAL 
SPECIALLY WRITTEN FOR TELEVISION 
VERY VERY FEW THINGS WERE WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY FOR TELEVISION 
AND PEOPLE WERE HORRIFIED BY IT BECAUSE IT WAS A HORROR SERIAL AND NOT THE SORT OF THING THEY EXPECTED 
GENERAL HUBBUB 
IT IS VICTOR VICTOR 
HE'S ALIVE THANK GOD 
QUATERMASS WAS SENSATIONAL 
WE HAD TO SEE IT WE CARED ABOUT IT WE WERE FRIGHTENED BY IT WE SAW A FUTURE OF TERRIFYING POSSIBILITIES 
OPENED UP BY IT AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT THE NEXT DAY YOU COULDN'T MISS IT 
IT'S OVER THERE 
QUATERMASS GRIPPED THE NATION I MEAN THIS WAS SCIENCE FICTION 
NOW IF YOU LOOKED AT IT NOW 
USED AS YOU ARE TO COMPUTER IMAGING AND ONE THING AND ANOTHER 
YOU WOULD THINK THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE CHILDISH 
BUT IN FACT THEY WERE VERY VERY POWERFUL IN THEIR TIME AND IN DOING THEIR JOB 
AND THE WHOLE NATION I MEAN PEOPLE WERE 
TERRIFIED THERE WERE PEOPLE SAYING I CAN'T WATCH 
IT'S ABOUT SIX INCHES DOWN PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER LET ME I CAN DO IT 
THERE'S SOME SORT OF ALARM OVER THERE AT THAT PLACE 
COME HERE 
IT'S JUST LIKE THE OTHER ONE I WAS RIGHT YOU TAKE IT I WANT TO GET SOME MEASUREMENTS QUICKLY 
THERE'S MEN COMING OUT THE GATES I HOPE THEY REALISE 
THIS IS FOR THEIR BENEFIT IT'S BREAKING UP SMELL IT YES 
AMMONIA 
DYLAN 
THERE'S SOMETHING ON YOUR FACE AH 
WAS LIKE A LITTLE CINEMA SCREEN 
BUT BECAUSE IT WAS IN YOUR HOME PEOPLE WERE VERY WORRIED ABOUT SHOWING THINGS 
THAT WERE TOO RISQUE OR TOO SQUEAMISH OR TOO HORRIFIC 
BUT THE B. B. C. BROKE THE RULES HERE BECAUSE THEY SHOWED SOMETHING A VERY FRIGHTENING SERIAL 
THAT TERRIFIED PEOPLE 
QUATERMASS 
GET PROFESSOR QUATERMASS 
HE'S IN THE PLANT NOW 
ALONE HE'S 
QUATERMASS 
QUATERMASS 
WHENEVER THERE WAS A NEW GENRE LIKE SCIENCE FICTION ON TELEVISION 
IT OPENED UP THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE COULD BE MORE AND MORE OF THIS 
AND THAT THE WORLD MIGHT GET MORE AND MORE STRANGE AND THERE COULD BE OTHER EXCITING ADVENTURES 
SO IT FIRED PEOPLE'S IMAGINATIONS IT REALLY DID 
I MEAN THE EARLY DRAMAS THAT BEGAN TO EXPLORE 
THINGS LIKE THAT SIMPLY OPENED UP YOUR MIND LIFTED YOUR SKULL OFF 
NIGEL KNEALE'S SCRIPT HAD BEEN KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF QUATERMASS HAVE I GOT TOO MUCH POWDER ON 
BUT IT HAD BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY ONE OF THE ERA'S MOST INFLUENTIAL PRODUCERS VIENNESE EMIGRE 
RUDOLPH CARTIER 
HE'S NOW WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE THE GODFATHER OF BRITISH T. V. DRAMA 
CUE 
HE IN MANY RESPECTS 
TREATED TELEVISION AS A TOTALLY 
DIFFERENT MEDIUM 
HE DIDN'T TRY TO DO THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE ON FILM 
HE DIDN'T TREAT IT AS RADIO WITH PICTURES 
WHICH HAD BEEN DONE UP TO THAT POINT 
HE WAS ALWAYS WANTING TO HAVE MORE FACILITIES 
AND MORE IMPACT 
AND BIGGER SETS AND BIGGER STARS 
CARTIER ACHIEVED ANOTHER STARTLING SUCCESS 
WITH NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR 
A GROUND BREAKING ADAPTATION OF GEORGE ORWELL'S NOVEL 
ABOUT LIFE IN A BRUTAL TOTALITARIAN STATE 
DOWN WITH CULTURE DOWN WITH THE ENEMIES OF THE PARTY 
KILL HIM SMASH HIM 
FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR IN WHICH HE HAD TWO HUGE STUDIOS 
FOR A PROGRAMME THAT WENT OUT LIVE 
HE PUT A FULL ORCHESTRA IN ONE STUDIO 
SO THEY COULD PLAY THE INCIDENTAL MUSIC WHILE THE PLAY WAS BEING PERFORMED IN THE OTHER STUDIO 
AND THAT'S CLEVER THE SCOPE THE INITIATIVE THAT HE USED 
TO GET OVER THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE CAUSED BY LACK OF MONEY 
LACK OF TECHNOLOGY 
LACK OF PEOPLE I GUESS HE WAS A GENIUS FOR GETTING OVER THOSE PROBLEMS 
THE BROADCAST OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR PROMPTED B. B. C. TELEVISION'S FIRST MAJOR CONTROVERSY 
NO NO NOT THOSE OH PLEASE O'BRIEN 
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT ME TO DO 
AFTER THE FIRST LIVE PERFORMANCE THERE WAS A CAMPAIGN WHICH TRIED TO PREVENT A LIVE REPEAT OF THE DRAMA 
WHICH HAD BEEN SCHEDULED FOR LATER IN THE WEEK 
DO IT TO JULIA DO IT TO JULIA NOT ME 
ONE PARTICULAR SCENE WHEN PETER CUSHING IS MENACED BY RATS 
WAS CONSIDERED SO TERRIFYING 
THAT QUESTIONS WERE ASKED IN PARLIAMENT ABOUT WHETHER THE B. B. C. SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SHOW THIS 
IT WAS DEBATABLE WHETHER THE REPEAT WOULD GO AHEAD 
BUT THE REPEAT DID GO AHEAD 
THE B. B. C. STOOD BY THEIR GUNS 
I THINK THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A STAND ON THIS 
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE SERVICE WOULD JUST STALL 
I LOVE BIG BROTHER 
COMMERCIAL TELEVISION IS HERE 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE B. B. C. TELEVISION FACED AN EVEN MORE UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENT 
WHEN ITS BROADCASTING MONOPOLY CAME TO AN END 
ON SEPTEMBER THE TWENTY SECOND THE FLEDGLING INDEPENDENT COMMERCIAL CHANNEL I. T. V. WAS LAUNCHED 
THOUGH ITS REACH WAS LIMITED 
ITS IMPACT WAS INSTANT 
AND DRAMATIC 
WHEN INSIDE THE FIRST YEAR 
I. T. V. IN THE LONDON AREA COS IT WAS ONLY LAUNCHED IN THE LONDON AREA SOUTHERN AREA 
GOT SEVENTY NINE PER CENT OF THE AUDIENCE 
AND LEFT THE B. B. C. WITH TWENTY ONE PER CENT 
THAT STAGGERED THEM 
WE WOKE UP IN THE B. B. C. ONE MORNING 
AND DISCOVERED THAT ACTUALLY THE MAJORITY OF THE AUDIENCE WAS NO LONGER WITH US 
WHICH WAS A BIG SHOCK 
BUT SO WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
AND SO WE BECAME AS IT WERE LESS ADVENTUROUS IN MANY WAYS 
I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE A MONOPOLY 
YOU CAN SAY WELL WE DON'T REALLY WANT THE ENTIRE NATION ADULT NATION TO SPEND THREE HOURS 
ALL NIGHT JUST SITTING IN FRONT OF A T. V. SET 
AND IT WAS THEN THEY STARTED TO REALISE THEY HAD TO DO DIFFERENT PROGRAMMES 
THEY HAD TO LEARN TO MAKE PROGRAMMES WHICH DIDN'T SIMPLY CATER FOR THIS KIND OF MIDDLE CLASS 
AND THEY SUDDENLY HAD TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE POPULIST PROGRAMMES AND THEY DID 
FROM THE MID FIFTIES TOWARDS THE MID SIXTIES THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE REVOLUTION IN WHAT THE B. B. C. DID 
RED RIVER ROCK BY JOHNNY AND THE HURRICANES 
THE YEARS JUST AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR SHAPED THE BROADCASTING INDUSTRY AS WE KNOW IT TODAY 
THE WAR UNLEASHED AN ARMY OF ENTERTAINERS INTENT ON MAKING MISCHIEF 
AND CHALLENGING CONVENTIONS 
WHO REVOLUTIONISED BRITISH TELEVISION AND RADIO 
THIS RADICAL GENERATION ESTABLISHED NEW GENRES 
AND BROKE OLD TABOOS 
THEY CREATED FORMS OF POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT 
THAT BECAME THE CORNERSTONE OF BRITISH LIFE FOR DECADES TO COME 
THAT CHANGE WAS ENORMOUS AND IT WAS HERALDED BY PEOPLE LIKE GALTON AND SIMPSON 
WRITING ABOUT HANCOCK WRITING ABOUT STEPTOE 
MOVING US INTO A SOCIETY WHERE A MERITOCRACY 
WHERE THINGS WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY HAD BEEN IN THE WAR 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WAR AND IT WAS THIS PERIOD FORTY FIVE FIFTY FIVE INTO THE EARLY SIXTIES 
WHEN ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING WE WERE REBELLING AGAINST THE STATUS QUO THAT WE'D INHERITED 
FROM BEFORE THE WAR AND DURING THE WAR AND TO GET RID OF IT CHANGE IT 
CHANGE IT FOR GOOD AND FOR EVER THIS TIME 
THERE WERE SORT OF BENCHMARKS ESTABLISHED THEN 
THE OBVIOUS ONES WERE THE GOON SHOW TAKE IT FROM HERE YOU REALISED WHAT COULD BE DONE 
PROGRAMMES DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE LIKE THEY'D BEEN BEFORE 
LIKE MONTY PYTHON ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR DEBT TO SPIKE MILLIGAN IT CONTINUES YOU KNOW 
THE GOON SHOW WAS MY GENERATION'S MONTY PYTHON 
OH HELLO AND YOU PICKED THE FUNERAL FOR THREE O'CLOCK 
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE COMEDY YOU HAVE TODAY 
IF YOU HADN'T HAD THAT BREAK 
IN THE RESPECTFUL COMMUNITY 
THAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF THE WAR 
THE END OF DEFERENCE WAS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT 
BEFORE THAT EVERYONE HAD BEEN A BIT FORELOCK TUGGING AND POLITE 
AND AFTER THE WAR IN THE YEARS AFTER THE WAR 
IT WAS NEVER GOING TO COME BACK 
AND IT COULD ONLY GET FREER AND FREER 
SO THE DOORS SWUNG WIDE AND EVERYONE POURED THROUGH 
IT'S A BRAW BRICHT MOONLICHT NICHT THE NICHT THIS MORNING 
SHE'S A BONNIE WEE LASSIE OUT THERE HOOTS MON THE NOO 
WOULD YOU MIND SITTING DOWN THERE PLEASE MR. HANCOCK
