HELLO AGAIN FROM THE CRUCIBLE 
ACTION FROM THE SECOND'S DAY PLAY 
OF THE EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
ON THE WAY THE LOSERS ARE ALREADY 
ON THEIR WAY HOME FIRST UP 
MATCH BETWEEN ALI CARTER AND BARRY 
HAWKINS 
DUE TO 
FINISH IN THE 
AFTERNOON SESSION BARRY JUST WOULD 
NOT GIVE UP AND FOUGHT BACK TO NINE 
NINE 
THE DECIDER 
HAD TO BE HELD OVER 
UNTIL ATTAIN BECAME AVAILABLE IN 
THE EVENING SESSION COMMENTARY BE 
ARE WILLIE THORN AND DENNIS TAYLOR 
HE WENT ALL OUT FOR THE PINK 
DIDN'T HE HOW COSTLY WILL THAT BE 
IT IS THE EASIEST THING IN THE 
WORLD IN THIS SITUATION UST TRY TOO HARD AFTER BEING SEVEN THREE 
AND NINE 
SIX ALI 
CARTER IS JUST TRYING TOO 
SIX ALI CARTER IS JUST TRYING TOO HARD 
IT IS TOUGH TO SEE HIM WINNING THE 
FRAME FROM THIS POSITION BUT HE 
COULD BECOME STRONG FAVOURITE THIS 
WOULD BE A BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW 
IF ALI LOST THIS MATCH BUT HE HAS 
NOT PLAYED 
BADLY IN THIS FRAME 
JUST ONE BAD SAFETY SHOT BARRY BARRY HAWKINS REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF 
DARREN MORGAN THE LEFT HANDER FROM 
WALES SO SIMILAR THE CUE ACTION 
DARREN MORGAN IS STILL PLAYING 
AMATEUR 
SNOOKER AND 
WINNING HE 
AMATEUR SNOOKER AND WINNING HE HOLDS THE 
WORLD TITLE 
AT THE MOMENT YES 
HE IS 
PLAYING 
IN SENIOR 
AT THE 
MOMENT HE 
HAS A 
NICE LITTLE 
SNOOKER CLUB IN 
WALES AS 
WELL HE 
IS A CHARACTER 
DARREN MORGAN 
THIS 
IS A 
BIT 
CARELESS IS 
HE TRYING TO 
HOLD THE SPOT 
I THINK HE IS BECAUSE 
THE PINK 
GOES 
IT IS 
NOT A 
BAD CHOICE THERE 
I WAS JUST 
WORRIED IN CASE 
HE HAD 
NOT HELD 
THE 
SPOT PROPERLY HE WOULD HAVE 
SNOOKERED HIMSELF HE IS 
RIGHT BACK 
INTO THIS 
DECIDING FRAME OF 
INTO THIS DECIDING FRAME OF THE MATCH 
NOW WHAT 
KIND OF 
LEAD IF 
NOT AN UNASSAILABLE ONE WILL HE 
GET 
JUST STEADYING HIMSELF THE 
APPLAUSE COMING FROM THE OTHER 
TABLE IT WOULD BE A GREAT COMEBACK 
FROM 
NINE 
SIX 
SEVEN 
THREE BEHIND THEN NINE 
SIX 
TO WIN THE LAST FOUR 
FRAMES AT 
THE CRUCIBLE 
THEATRE TO GET 
THROUGH YOUR 
FIRST ROUND 
WOULD BE 
A 
TERRIFIC 
PERFORMANCE BUT 
HE HAS 
GOT 
AWAY TO GO YET 
GETTING A 
BIT 
STICKY MAKING 
SURE THE 
CUE WILL 
STICKY MAKING SURE THE CUE WILL SLIDE BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB 
IT GET A 
LITTLE BIT DAMP AND THE 
CUE WILL STICK 
AND CAUSE 
IT IS HOT OUT THERE BOYS 
IDEALLY HE WOULD LIKE TO PLAY ANOTHER 
COLOUR THAN 
THE BLACK AT 
THE MOMENT 
HOW DOES HE GET TWO REDS AND TWO 
BLACKS 
FROM HERE 
IF THE 
BLACK WAS 
ON ITS 
SPOT THIS WOULD BE A TOUGH 
SHOT HE CAN PLAY 
IT A 
LOT MORE 
GENTLY GIVE THE POCKET 
A CHANCE TO 
TAKE THE SHOT HE HAS TO PLAY IT WITH SOME PACE 
ALONG THE 
CUSHION YOU 
HAVE GOT TO 
BE VERY PRECISE 
WHEN YOU 
FORCE IT 
LITTLE BIT THAT IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN 
SO THE EXCITEMENT CONTINUES 
ALLISTER CARTER IS STILL SITTING IN 
HIS SEAT 
BARRY HAWKINS 
IS 
LOOKING AT THE RED OVER THE POCKET 
JUST THE PACE KEPT IT OUT THE PREVIOUS FRAME TO 
THIS BEFORE 
THE PLAYERS 
HAD TO 
COME OFF ALI 
CARTER MADE FORTY BREAK BARRY HAWKINS MADE FIFTY NINE 
TO DRAW 
LEVEL IT 
IS ANXIOUS NOW 
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT HE HAS 
THE PERFECT ANGLE ON THE RED TO 
LEAVE A THREE QUARTER BALL BLACK 
LOOK WHERE HE IS HAVING TO PUT THE 
REST THAT WAS NOT A FORWARD 
SHOT HE 
HAS GOT THE 
PERFECTLY 
I AM 
GOING TO 
PUT A 
PERFECTLY COUPLE 
OF CUE BALL'S UP IF 
HE GET 
INTO 
EITHER OF 
THOSE POSITIONS 
HAS 
GOT THE 
RED INTO 
POCKET OR THE 
RED INTO 
THE CORNER 
I DON'T 
THINK IT 
PASSES THE 
GREEN 
SO HE 
HAS GOT TO BE PRECISE 
THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD TO ME IT'S IT'S NOT FAIR YOU PUTTING THOSE CUE 
BALLS UP DENNIS IT STOPS THE CUE 
BALL IN ITS SPOT THIS IS THE KEY 
SHOT 
WE KNOW UNDER PRESSURE NOTHING IS EASY 
HE NEEDS THE YELLOW GREEN BROWN 
AND BLUE 
IT IS HARD TO SEE HIM 
MISSING NOW WHAT A BATTLE BARRY 
HAWKINS HAS BEEN IN 
HE HAS 
HIS HEART 
OUT IN 
THIS MATCH 
AS 
WOULD THIS 
WILL BE 
A 
BITTER PILL 
SWALLOW 
IT IS 
A SHAME 
THERE HAS 
BE A 
LOSER WHEN 
YOU GET 
DOWN TO 
DECIDING 
FRAME IT 
MEANS SO 
MUCH TO 
THESE YOUNG PLAYERS ALI CARTER A 
FEW MOMENTS AGO 
THOUGHT HE 
WOULD BE 
ON HIS 
WAY DOWN 
THE MOTORWAY 
ON HIS WAY DOWN THE MOTORWAY BUT HE 
WILL BE 
AROUND AND 
HE HAS 
GOT A 
CHANCE TO PLAY A 
THREE SESSION 
OF 
TWENTY FIVE FRAMES THAT 
IS THE 
WANTED HE 
WILL BE 
FEELING SO 
WANTED HE WILL BE FEELING SO RELIEVED INSIDE BARRY WHAT A FIGHT BACK HE HAS MADE 
VERY HARD LUCK BARRY HAWKINS IT WAS 
A TERRIFIC 
MATCH DECIDED 
ON THE 
LAST FRAME 
AND IT 
IS ALI 
CARTER WHO 
COMMIT 
GOES THROUGH TO THE NEXT 
ROUND ROUND IT WAS QUITE 
A HARD 
PILL TO 
I 
WAS NOT 
HAPPY TO GET 
PULLED OFF 
BUT THE 
TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR HAS 
RULES AND I 
HAVE TO 
STICK BY 
I 
THOUGHT IN 
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES 
I THOUGHT IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES SURELY 
THEY COULD HAVE TURNED 
SURELY THEY COULD HAVE TURNED A BLIND 
EYE TO IT I'M SURE 
WOULD 
NOT HAVE 
MINDED WAITING 
WOULD NOT HAVE MINDED WAITING AN EXTRA 
TWENTY MINUTE

LONELY PLACE

SOME GOOD 
SNOOKER THAT 
I 
NOW I 
CAN JUST TO 
HIGHLIGHT THE 
DIFFERENCE IN 
REGARD TO 
DIFFERENCE IN REGARD TO CRUCIBLE EXPERIENCE 
FIRST TIME 
HERE IN 
EXPERIENCE FIRST TIME HERE IN SHEFFIELD FOR JAMIE PLAYED HERE IN 
NINETEEN NINETY TWO REACHED THE 
FINAL FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN 
NINETY SIX SIX 
YEARS

WAS PETER'S SEVENTEENTH 
TWO THOUSAND TWO OVERALL THIS WAS PETER'S SEVENTEENTH APPEARANCE 
IN WORLD 
APPEARANCE IN WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP FINALS 
IT WAS JAMIE 
WHO LEAD 
GOING 
INTO THE 
FINAL 
SESSION BUT 
INTO THE FINAL SESSION BUT PETER FOUGHT 
BACK TO 
MAKE IT SEVEN SEVEN 
COMMENTARY BY TERRY GRIFFITHS AND 
CLIVE EVERTON 
QUARTER RED AND THEN THE BLACK THE THE SHOT THAT COPE ATTEMPTED NEEDED TO 
BE ULTRA THIN 
HE CANNONED THE PINK 
AND THE BLACK JAMIE COPE HAS BEEN 
SHUT OUT 
PETER 
EBDON HE WILL 
NOT BE 
PETER EBDON HE WILL NOT BE THE FIRST 
TO GO 
THROUGH THE PAIN 
OF 
WENT EBDON SHUT 
OUT IT 
HAS BEEN 
OVER EIGHTEEN 
MINUTES NOW SINCE JAMIE 
OVER EIGHTEEN MINUTES NOW SINCE JAMIE SHORTED 
POTTED 
A BALL 
IT SEEMS 
LIKE ABOUT FIVE 
HOURS WHEN 
YOU ARE 
LIKE ABOUT FIVE HOURS WHEN YOU ARE IN THE CHAIR 
THE PLAYERS WITH EXPERIENCE OF 
WINNING MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIPS VERY 
OFTEN GET STRONGER AS THE HEAT 
GROWS HOTTER BUT NO SOONER WERE 
THOSE WORDS OUT OF 
MY MOUTH THAN 
EBDON PLAYED 
A POOR POSITIONAL SHOT 
EBDON PLAYED A POOR POSITIONAL SHOT FOR PINK THERE YOU GO YOU SEE 
HE TURNED 
DOWN A BLUE 
EARLIER ON 
THAT WAS 
EASIER THAN THAT EXPERIENCE 
EASIER THAN THAT EXPERIENCE TELLS YOU 
WHEN TO PUSH 
THE BOAT 
OUT AND 
WHEN TO PLAY SAFE EBDON HAS BEEN 
THERE SO 
MANY TIMES HE 
SUFFERED BY 
GOING 
FOR TOO 
MANY AND 
SUFFERED BY GOING FOR TOO MANY AND SOMETIMES 
YOU ARE 
TWO DEFENCES 
SOMETIMES YOU ARE TWO DEFENCES DEFENSIVE AS WELL 
HE IS SCREWING INTO THE REDS AND 
BLACKS BLACK JUST THE REDS 
RELEASING 
THE PINK SPOT EBDON SENSES HERE FIRST TIME IN THE MATCH 
THERE IS SUFFICIENT POTENTIAL 
THIS THIS FRAME WITH REDS AND PINKS 
THE PREVIOUS TWO FRAMES HAVE TAKEN 
THIRTY ONE AND THIRTY MINUTES THIS IS EBDON 
COUNTRY THIS ONE 
HAS ONLY 
BEEN 
COUNTRY THIS ONE HAS ONLY BEEN RUNNING 
FOR TWELVE 
MINUTES THOUGH AND 
YOU JUST 
FEEL EBDON IS 
GOING TO 
MAKE THE 
BALLS EVERYTHING 
IS GOING 
MAKE THE BALLS EVERYTHING IS GOING RIGHT 
HIS POSITION ON 
RIGHT HIS POSITION ON POTTING NO ONE 
IS EVER 
GOING TO QUESTION HIS 
ONE IS EVER GOING TO QUESTION HIS TEMPERAMENT 
EBDON HAS ALREADY DONE ENOUGH TO 
SECURE THE FRAME EBDON WILL 
NEVER FAIL 
IN ONE 
WAY 
HE ALWAYS PREPARES 
VERY THOROUGHLY 
HE ALWAYS PREPARES VERY THOROUGHLY FOR MAJOR EVENTS SOMEHOW ALL OF 
THOSE HOURS OF PRACTICE PAY OFF 
WHEN YOU HAVE TO 
DIG DEEP FOR 
A 
WHEN YOU HAVE TO DIG DEEP FOR A LITTLE BIT EXTRA 
THE ONLY REMAINING POINT OF 
INTEREST IN THIS FRAME IS WHETHER 
PETER EBDON CAN MAKE CENTURY IT 
WOULD BE HIS FIFTIETH AT THE CRUCIBLE 
HAVING FIRST COME HERE IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
THIS PINK FOR HIS FIFTIETH CENTURY AT 
THE CRUCIBLE SINCE HE FIRST PLAYED 
HERE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO HIS SECOND CENTURY IN 
THE MATCH A SUPERB CLEARANCE BY 
PETER EBDON HE GOES AHEAD FOR THE 
FIRST TIME AT EIGHT TO SEVEN 
FROM SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TEN PETER EBDON HAS WON 
THREE CONSECUTIVE FRAMES FROM SEVEN 
FIVE BEHIND 
JAMIE COPE WILL BE TRIED TO STOP 
HIM IN THE ONLY WAY THAT HE KNOWS 
HOW TRYING TO STOP HIM A VERY GOOD SHOT 
HE TOOK THE BULL BY THE HORNS THERE HE COULD NOT COMFORTABLY GET THROUGH TO THE RED OVER THE POCKET 
I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT JAMIE 
COPE'S TEMPERAMENT WOULD BE PUT TO 
THE TEST HERE HE HAS CERTAINLY 
COME UP TRUMPS SO FAR 
HE IS NOT PLAYING ANY SLOWER 
DESPITE ANY TENSION THAT MIGHT BE 
IN THE AIR OR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 
THE MOMENT 
PETER EBDON ALREADY REQUIRES A 
SNOOKER THE ONLY REMAINING POINT 
OF INTEREST IS WHETHER JAMIE COPE 
CAN GO ON TO RECORD HIS SECOND 
CENTURY OF THE EVENING UNLIKELY NOW 
A GREAT POT TO THE MIDDLE 
IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN UNLIKELY FOR ALMOST BUT 
THIS BOY IS A BIT SPECIAL 
HE PLAYS 
LIKE THIS EVERY DAY IN PRACTICE 
BUT THIS IS NOT PRACTICE THIS IS 
THE CRUCIBLE WHERE THE HEAT IS ON 
PETER EBDON TO HAVE TO LAST FRAME 
WITH A BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED NINE JAMIE COPE HAS 
RESPONDED WITH A CENTURY OF HIS OWN 
HE CAN POT THEM FROM ANYWHERE THIS 
BOY 
A TERRIFIC RESPONSE FROM JAMIE COPE 
HE LEVELS THE MATCH 
WHAT A MATCH THIS TURNED LEAD TO BE 
IN THE FINAL FRAME DECIDER PETER 
EBDON IS TRAILING BY THIRTY ONE 
I CERTAINLY DID NOT EXPECT PETER 
EBDON TO MISS THAT ONE 
IN DUE COURSE HE COULD PLAY THE 
RED ON THE SIDE CUSHION CAN KNOCK 
IN THE RED OVER THE BOTTOM POCKET WELL 
HE PLAYS THE SHOT ALL THE WELL TIME AND THIS IS THE DECIDING FRAME 
OF THIS MATCH IF HE HAS GOT THE 
OUTSIDE RED HE COULD BE O. K. 
HE HAD THE TWO REDS AND THE BALL 
CLIVE HE COULD HAVE PLAYED FOR 
WIDE TAKES SUCH A RISK THE TWO 
REDS ON THE BAULK LINE WHITE TAKE 
SUCH A RISK 
MISTAKES CREEPING IN FROM BOTH 
PLAYERS UNDERSTANDABLE IN THIS 
DECIDING FRAME 
PETER EBDON COMES TO THE TABLE FORTY 
BEHIND BUT NOT OUT OF IT AS HE 
WAS HEARING THAT HE WOULD BE TOO 
WELL THREE SHOTS AGO TWO WAR 
THREE SHOTS 
IT TOOK SOME COURAGE TO PLAY THAT 
SHOT AT THIS STAGE WITH THE BALL 
HANGING ON THE POCKET 
AS PETER EBDON DONE THE SAME THING 
SURELY NOT HE HAS TO BE ON ONE OF 
THOSE REDS 
I WOULD NORMALLY BE SAYING AT THIS 
TIME IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF CAN HE 
HOLD HIMSELF TOGETHER BUT I WOULD 
NEVER SAY THAT ABOUT PETER EBDON 
HE HAS PROVED HIMSELF MANY TIMES 
THAT HE CAN KEEP IT TOGETHER UNDER 
EXTREME PRESSURE 
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT WHEN 
YOU GET THE REWARD FOR THE PRACTICE 
THIS WOULD NOT BE BAD TIME THIS MUST BE AGONISING FOR JAMIE 
COPE HE WAS SO NEAR THE WINNING 
LINE 
BUT HE MADE A VERY QUESTIONABLE 
SHOT CHOICE WHICH MAY WELL HAVE 
COST HIM THE MATCH ALTHOUGH PETER 
EBDON HAS GOT TO MAKE IT COST HIM 
THE MATCH A LITTLE SHORT OF PACE THERE 
ONE MINI CRISIS OUT OF THE WAY FOR 
PETER EBDON IT IS WHEN YOU LOSE 
POSITION AT THIS STAGE THAT JOHN 
STOMACH STARTS TO WOBBLE LITTLE BIT YOUR STOMACH 
IT IS LOOKS AS IT LOOKS AS THOUGH 
IT IS GOING TO BE EXPERIENCE TEN IT 
USED NINE PETER EBDON IN PERFECT 
POSITION TO MAKE THIS INTO A FRAME 
AND MATCH WINNING CONTRIBUTION 
AND THIS RED WITH THE COLLAPSE AND 
THE THREE BAULK COLOURS WOULD BE 
ENOUGH THIS RED WITH A COLOUR 
WELL WELL I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT 
WAS CLOSE HE WAS ALWAYS COMING 
CLOSE TO THE YELLOW WITHOUT SIDE A A VERY UNEXPECTED LOSS OF POSITION 
JIMMY COULD'S HOPES ARE RENEWED 
JAMIE COPE 
IT IS A BRILLIANT MATCH DEFINITELY 
THE BEST MATCH BUT WE HAVE HAD HERE 
SO FAR HE IS NOT 
GOING 
TO TAKE THIS ON 
SURELY NOT 
PETER EBDON CAN TAKE THIS LONG AS 
HE IS FOURTEEN POINTS IN FRONT 
BUT THE CANNON ON THE BROWN TO 
BOILS HIS POSITION FOR GREEN 
SPOILS HIS POSITION A FINE SHOT AND BROWN IS MATCH BALL 
PETER EBDON HAS DONE VERY WELL HERE 
A LOT OF PLAYERS HAVING FUMBLED 
SUCH A GOOD MATCH WINNING CHANCE 
WOULD HAVE LOOKED BACK WITH CREW 
GREAT BUT PETER EBDON ONLY LOOKED 
FORWARD 
IT LEAVES JINNY COPE NEEDING ONE 
SNOOKER TO TIE JAMIE COPE FIVE FIVE MINUTES LATER PETER APPLAUDED THE 
PERFORMANCE OF JAMIE COPE BUT IT IS 
PETER EBDON WHO IS THROUGH 
HE IS THIS HUGELY TALENTED YOUNG 
MAN SO DANGEROUS L. FELT SO WELL 
PREPARED COMING INTO THIS MATCH AND 
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO GO LIKE THAT 
TO BE HONEST THERE YOU GO YOU 
TALK ABOUT EXPERIENCE I SHOULD 
HAVE TAKEN THE YELLOW AND THE 
YELLOW AGAIN PLAYED THE BROWN 
AND GOT A SLIGHTLY HEAVY CONTACT 
WHICH TOOK ME TOWARDS THE YELLOW 
YOU NEVER KNOW YOU PLAY THE SHOT 
AS YOU SEE IT AT THE TIME BUT IN 
HINDSIGHT I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE 
YELLOW AND THE YELLOW AGAIN ALL 
SORTS OF THINGS RUN THROUGH YOUR 
MIND GETTING A KICK ON THE YELLOW 
DELIGHTED TO WIN 
WELL PLAYED BOTH PLAYERS NOW WE 
HAVE A SNOOKER EXTRA PROGRAMME ON 
THE WAY FEATURING RYAN DAY AGAINST 
MICHAEL JUDGE THEN VIA THE RED 
BUTTON COVERAGE GET GOING AT TEN 
O'CLOCK LATER TODAY UNTIL THEN 
COULD BUY FROM THE CRUCIBLE WE 
CLOSE WITH A REMINDER FROM THE MAN 
WHO WAS WORLD CHAMPION WORLD 
CHAMPION TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO JOE JOHNSON
