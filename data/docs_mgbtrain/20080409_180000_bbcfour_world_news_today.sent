PROTESTS THAT HAVE TURNED VIOLENT 
EARLY THIS MORNING CHINESE 
CULTURAL GROUPS TOOK THEIR PLACES 
ALONG THE ROUTE HOPING TO COUNTER 
THE DEMONSTRATORS 
I THINK THEY'RE DEFLUXING THE 
PEACEFUL PROGRESS AND MEANING OF 
OLYMPIC GAMES 
THEY HAVE THEIR 
PEACEFUL PROTESTING AND THAT'S FINE 
WE'RE HERE TO WELCOME THE TORCH AND 
THEY CAN DO THEIR OWN STUFF BUT BUT SCENES LIKE THIS MAY NOT BE WHAT 
PEOPLE REMEMBER WHAT THIS LATEST 
LEG OF THE BEIJING OLYMPICS TORCH 
RELAY THE TORCH BEGAN IN THE 
JOURNEY OF HARM ANY ON MARCH TWENTY FOURTH 
WHEN IT WAS STARTED FROM GREECE 
THAT'S WHERE THE TROUBLE BEGAN IT 
CONTINUED IN TURKEY BRITAIN AND 
FRANCE OTHER FLASH POINTS WILL BE 
INDIA AND AUSTRALIA AND ONE OF 
COURSE WHEN THE TORCH ARRIVES IN 
TIBET THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SAID 
TODAY THAT WILL GO AHEAD OUR 
SPORTS EDITOR REPORTS NOW 
A VERY DIFFERENT PROTEST BY TIBETAN 
MONKS IN WESTERN CHINA TODAY 
CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD HAS 
CAST ON THE BEIJING GAMES THE 
OLYMPIC MOVEMENT IS BEGINING TO 
REALISE IT NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS 
ISSUE ISSUE 
THERE ARE MANY CONFLICTS AND MANY COUNTRIES HERE 
WE ARE IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE GAMES 
WILL TAKE PLACE WE WANT TO HELP 
CHINA 
CHINA'S OLYMPIC STADIUM WILL CHINA BE GLEAMING COME THE OPENING 
CEREMONY BUT CLEANING UP THE IMAGE 
OF THE TORCH RELAY WILL PROVE A LOT 
MORE DIFFICULT DESPITE I. O. C. 
MISGIVING CHINA IS DETERMINED TO 
COMPLETE THE JOURNEY BY ANY MEANS 
POSSIBLE POSSIBLE 
IF THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS DURING THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
RELAY FROM TIBET TO MOUNT EVEREST 
IF ANYONE DARES TO CREATE ANY 
TROUBLE WE WILL WITHOUT DOUBT 
DEAL WITH THOSE PERSONS SEVERELY 
WE WILL NOT BE MERCIFUL 
IT IS THIS HARD LINE IMAGE THAT HAS 
SEEN THE TORCH ESCORTED BY CHINESE 
MILITARY POLICE THROUGH LONDON AND 
PARIS THIS HAS NOT GONE DOWN WELL 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH MEANT TO PROMOTE 
PEACE AND HARM ANY IS SEEN TO BE 
TAKEN OVER BY CHINA THE 
UNHAPPINESS EXTENDS BEYOND THE I. O. C. 
TO COUNTRIES DUE TO HOLD THE TORCH 
AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER KEPT 
TRADE LINKS OPEN BY SPEAKING IN 
MANDARIN IN BEIJING TODAY BUT HIS 
POLICE CHIEF SAID THE TORCH'S 
SECURITY ENTOURAGE WOULD NOT BE 
WELCOME DOWN UNDER WITH THE CLOCK 
TICKING TO THE START OF THE GAMES 
I'M TOLD THAT OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL 
OF THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC 
COMMITTEE THERE IS INCREASING 
PRESSURE FOR A PUBLIC STATEMENT 
ASKING CHINA TO SETTLE THE TIBET 
ISSUE PEACEFULLY IT IS HOPED THAT 
SUCH A MOVE WILL CONVINCE THE WORLD 
THE I. O. C. CARES ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS 
AND HELP RESCUE THE IMAGE OF THE 
GAMES 
SORRY ABOUT THE TECHNICAL GLITCH IN 
THAT REPORT OUR CORRESPONDENT 
JOINS US FROM SAN FRANSISCO I KNOW 
IT HASN'T QUITE STARTED YET BUT 
WHAT'S THE ATMOSPHERE AND WHAT ARE 
YOU EXPECTING TO HAPPEN THE THE FEELINGS ARE RUNNING I THINK IT 
WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY VERY HIGH HERE 
ALREADY WITH LESS THAN TWO HOURS 
TO GO BEFORE THE ACTUAL START OF 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY I 
WITNESSED SOME HEATED EXCHANGES 
ALREADY IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES IN 
FACT BETWEEN PRO CHINA SUPPORTERS 
AND DEMONSTRATORS WHO ARE SEEKING 
TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE EVENTS IN 
DARFUR AND TIBET NOW THE POLICE 
ARE VERY CONCERNED HERE THEY SAY 
THERE IS NO WAY OF PROTECTING THE 
ENTIRE ROUTE AND RUMOURS ARE RIFE 
HERE UNCONFIRMED AT THE MOMENT 
THEY ARE TAKING MEASURES TO 
DRASTICALLY REDUCE THE LENGTH OF 
THIS ROUTE THIS OLYMPIC TORCH 
RELAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SIX 
MILES WE HEARD THEY COULD BE 
CUTTING IT IN HALF SUCH IS THE 
FEAR OF PROTESTS AND POTENTIALLY 
VIOLENT PROTESTS WORD HAD IT 
SIX THOUSAND PLUS PEOPLE WERE CONVERGING 
ON SAN FRANSISCO TO RAISE THEIR 
VOICE IN PROTEST AGAINST THE 
OLYMPIC FLAG AND THE POLICE AS I 
MENTIONED SAID THEY HAD VERY REAL 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE SECURITY 
SITUATION HERE THEY'VE IMPOSED A 
NO FLEE ZONE ABOVE US IN THE AIR 
HERE THEY ARE ALSO PACKING THE 
GROUND WITH OFFICERS NO FLY ZONE 
BUT AS I MENTIONED THE ONLY REAL 
WAY TO SECURE THE SAFETY OF THOSE 
PAR TAKING SEEMS TO BE TO 
DRASTICALLY REDUCE THE LENGTH OF 
THE ROUTE 
SAN FRANSISCO WAS CHOSEN 
AS THE ONLY AMERICAN CITY FOR THE 
TORCH RELAY BECAUSE IT HAS ITS OWN 
HUGE CHINESE POPULATION DOESN'T 
IT 
IT DOES ABOUT A THIRD OF THE IT POPULATION HERE IS CHINESE IT IS 
THE LARGEST GROUP OF CHINESE OF ANY 
CITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND A 
LOT OF THEM I HAVE TO SAY ARE VERY 
PROUD OF THE FACT THAT BEIJING IS 
TO HOST THE OLYMPIC GAMES THIS YEAR 
ALTHOUGH IN MANY CASES THOSE I 
SPOKE TO ARE EMBARRASSED ABOUT THE 
CONTROVERSY IT HAS GENERATED SAN 
FRANSISCO OF COURSE IS A HOT BED 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HOT BED OF 
PROTEST OF RADICALISM STARTING IN 
THE DAYS OF THE VIETNAM WAR 
PROTESTS ON CAMPUSES HERE THAT 
CAUSED INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION TO 
HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND 
ESCAPE WITHOUT PROTEST IS PERHAPS A 
LITTLE NAIVE THE HOPE OF EVERYBODY 
HERE IS THAT THOSE PROTESTS WON'T 
FOLLOW IN THE LINE OF THOSE IN 
PARIS AND LONDON WHICH ON 
OCCASIONS TURNED VIOLENT 
THANK YOU 
ZIMBABWE'S RULING ZANU P. F. PARTY IS 
PREPARING FOR A RUNOFF IN THE 
COUNTRY'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 
BUT THE OPPOSITION HAS SAID A FEW 
HOURS AGO IT WILL NOT TAKE PART N. 
EITHER RUNOFF OR RECOUNT THIS 
COMES AS THE B. B. C. HAS HEARD DIRECT 
EVIDENCE OF ELECTORAL FRAUD THE 
B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE BUT OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IAN PANNELL IS THERE 
AND HE SENT US THIS REPORT 
THIS WAS THE REMARKABLE SCENE IN 
BULAWAYO TODAY AFTER ELEVEN DAYS OF 
WAITING FOR PRESIDENTIAL RESULTS 
THE FIRST PUBLIC SHOW OF DEFIANCE 
WE FILMED SECRETLY AS THE ILLEGAL 
MARCH MOVED THROUGH TOWN THESE 
PEOPLE SAY THEY'RE NOT POLITICAL 
WHAT THEY WANT IS A BETTER LIFE FOR 
ZIMBABWE WITHIN MINUTES THEY 
REACHED THE STEPS OF THE HIGH COURT 
AND IT WAS OVER 
PLACARDS AND LEAFLETS THROWN TO THE 
GROUND A SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT 
ACT CATCHING THE AUTHORITIES OFF 
GUARD BUT WITHOUT ACCESS TO 
INDEPENDENT NEWS MOST PEOPLE HAVE 
NO IDEA WHAT IS HAPPENING THE 
GOVERNMENT TELLS THEM THE VOTE WAS 
RIGGED BY THE OPPOSITION AND WHITE 
FARMERS WANT TO RECLAIM THEIR LAND 
DAILY LIFE IS CONSUMED WITH MAKING 
ENDS MEET AND SWAPPING RUMOURS 
THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO WITH 
THIS REGIME VERY LITTLE BEATINGS 
EVERYTHING SO NOTHING THEY'RE 
GOING TO DO 
NOW FOR THE FIRST 
TIME DIRECT EVIDENCE OF GOVERNMENT 
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTIONS 
AS ZIMBABWE POLICE DETECTIVE AGREED 
TO MEET US AT A SECRET LOCATION HE 
SHOWED ME HIS POLICE CARD TO 
CONFIRM HIS IDENTITY AND TOLD ME 
THAT HE'D BEEN ORDERED WHO TO VOTE 
FOR 
I WAS TOLD TO SIGN FOR MUGABE FOR HE WAS YOUR EMPLOYER SO IF YOU 
COULD NOT VOTE FOR MUGABE YOU HAVE 
A RESIGNATION FORM 
JUST TO BE 
CLEAR WERE THEY ENCOURAGING YOU OR 
TELLING YOU 
THEY WERE ACTUALLY 
TELLING US WHO TO VOTE 
IT IS A 
DAMNING REVELATION ABOUT AN 
ELECTION CONSUMED BY DELAYS AND 
SUSPICION THIS IS WHY THE RESULT 
MATTERS WE WERE TAKEN TO A 
HOSPITAL TO SEE A HEALTH SERVICE ON 
THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE MOST OF THE 
WOMEN ON THIS WARD SUFFER FROM 
AIDS RELATED ILLNESSES A LACK OF 
DRUGS MEANS THEY'LL ALMOST 
CERTAINLY DIE THE GRAVEYARD IS 
TESTAMENT TO ONE OF THE FEW 
THRIVING BUSINESSES HERE BURYING 
THE DEAD WHAT'S AT STAKE IS MORE 
THAN THE FATE OF MUGABE AND HIS 
PARTY BUT PERHAPS THE VERY 
SALVATION OF THE COUNTRY NOW A 
LOOK AT THE DAY'S OTHER NEWS AT 
LEAST TWO ISRAELI CIVILIANS HAVE 
BEEN KILLED IN A RAID IN SOUTHERN 
ISRAEL BY PALESTINIAN MILITANTS 
THE ISRAELI DEFENCE FORCE SAID AT 
LEAST TWO MILITANTS HAD DIED IN THE 
ATTACK WHICH HAPPENED IN THE NAHAL 
OZ BORDER NEAR GAZA STRIP A CAR 
WAS TARGETED BELONGING TO MEMBERS 
OF ISLAMIC JIHAD SEEFPB PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN 
KARACHI AMONG 
THE DEAD WERE THE BODIES OF FOUR 
PEOPLE FOUND IN A BUILDING THAT WAS 
SET ABLAZE THERE WERE REPORTS 
WHICH TROUBLE BEGAN LAWYERS WHICH 
MUSHARRAF CLASHED WITH THE 
SUPPORTERS IN SOUTH KOREA THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF THE PRESIDENT 
HAS WON A MAJORITY IN TUESDAY'S 
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS THE RESULT 
SHOULD ENABLE MR. LEE TO PUSH 
THROUGH WIDE RANGING ECONOMIC 
REFORMS THE TURNOUT WAS LOW AND 
THE COUNTRY'S ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
HAS ALSO REPORTED THAT AROUND FORTY SIX PER CENT 
OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS TOOK PART 
FRANCE IS WITHDRAWING THE 
HUMANITARIAN MISSION IT SENT TO 
COLOMBIA TO SECURE THE RELEASE OF 
THE HOSTAGE THE F. A. R. C. REBELS THAT 
WAS HOLDING HER SAID THAT THE 
FRENCH ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE MEDICAL 
ATTENTION FOR HER WERE UNREASONABLE 
THE ANTICS IN SAN FRANCISCO MAY 
PROVIDE DISTRACTION ON A DAY WHEN 
AMERICA'S ECONOMY IS EXTREMELY GRIM 
THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND HAS 
PREDICTED AMERICA WILL GO INTO 
RECESSION AND THE I. M. F. HAS PREDICTED 
THERE'S A ONE IN FOUR CHANCE THE 
TURMOIL IN THE CREDIT MARKETS WILL 
TRIGGER A GLOBAL RECESSION THE 
IN RECENT WEEKS THE I. M. F. HAVE BEEN 
ACCUSED OF UNDER PLAYING HOW 
FRAGILE THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM 
IS BECOMING NOW IT'S SLASHED ITS 
GROWTH FORECASTS AND ISSUED WHAT 
AMOUNTS TO A CLAUL FOR GLOBAL 
COLLECTIVE ACTION BY GOVERNMENTS 
AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALIKE 
IN SHORT THE EXPANSION THE WORLD 
TOOK FOR GRANTED IS LOSING SPEED 
THE I. M. F. FORECAST GLOBAL ECONOMIC 
GROWTH WILL FALL BY OH FIVE PER CENT TO THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT 
IN AMERICA IT WILL DROP TO OH FIVE PER CENT 
THIS YEAR AND LITTLE MORE THE NEXT 
BRITAIN MAY FARE LITTLE BETTER 
AROUND SIXTEEN PER CENT NEXT YEAR SENTIMENT IN 
FINANCIAL MARKETS HAS IMPROVED IN 
RECENT WEEKS SINCE THE FEDERAL 
RESERVE'S FRONG ACTIONS BUT WE 
HAVE SEEN HOW STRANGE THE MARKETS 
CAN BECOME REINFORCING ANDS 
POSSIBILITY OF A NEGATIVE SPIRAL 
REMAINS REAL 
IN THIS FORECAST THE I. M. F. SPELLS OUT 
HOW THE REGULATORS FAILED TO SPOT 
HOW RISKY BANK BEHAVIOUR HAD BECOME 
AS A RESULT THE SHORTAGE OF CREDIT 
AND FALLING CONFIDENCE SPILLED OUT 
OF THE U. S. MARKET INTO BUSINESS 
BORROWING AND PROPERTY VALUES 
ESPECIALLY WHERE THE PRICE OF 
HOUSES WAS CONCERNED IT CERTAINLY 
ADVANCED WESTERN ECONOMIES THAT 
WILL SEE THE SHARPEST DECLINES AS 
FOOD AND ENERGY PRICES SORE THE 
I. M. F. WARNS THE U. S. COULD EVEN TIP 
INTO MILD RECESSION THIS YEAR OWE 
OFFICIALLY TWO QUARTERS OF NEGATIVE 
GROWTH THE I. M. F. SAYS STILL RAPIDLY 
EMERGING CHINA AND INDIA HAVE 
AVOIDED MUCH OF THE SUB PRIME GLOOM 
AS THEIR BUSINESS ECONOMIES POWER 
AHEAD YET WHILE THEY MAY ESCAPE 
RECESSION INFLATION MAY BE A 
PROBLEM IT CITES CHINA AND THE 
MIDDLE EAST SAYING THEY WILL NEED 
TO REIGN IN THEIR CENTRAL SPENDING 
THE MESSAGE FOR GOVERNMENTS 
EVERYWHERE IS THEY NEED TO WORK 
MORE OPENLY WITH THEIR PRIVATE 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO FIND OUT 
WHERE THE WORTHLESS ASSETS ARE SO 
AS TO DISENTANGLE THEM AND BRING 
SOME CONFIDENCE BACK AS RECENT 
HISTORY SHOWS JUST PUMPING STATE 
MONEY INTO THE BANKING SYSTEM MAY 
NOT TURN THE TIDE AS LONG AS BAD 
LOANS ARE STILL LURKING 
JOINING ME NOW IS WILLIAM KEEGAN 
SENIOR ECONOMICS COMMENTATOR FOR 
THE OBSERVER NEWSPAPER WERE YOU 
SURPRISED BY THE I. M. F.'S CONCLUSIONS 
NOT REALLY IT'S BEEN COMING A LONG 
TIME THEIR LANGUAGE IS QUITE 
VOLUBLE AND SERIOUS NORMALLY YOU 
EXPECT OFFICIALS TO DOWNPLAY THINGS 
BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY NOT 
DOWNPLAYING THINGS THIS TIME MUCH 
THE MERE FACT THEY USED THE WORD 
RECESSION THEY HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT 
TO DO THAT 
I DIDN'T HEAR THE 
BRITISH CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER 
I HEARD HIM DOWN PLAYING THINGS 
THIS MORNING BUT THE I. M. F. IS NOT 
I I I THEY DON'T KNOW THE REAL PROBLEM 
IS THAT NEITHER THE OFFICIALS 
FINANCE MINISTERS CENTRAL BANK 
NOR THE BANKERS KNOW HOW SERIOUS 
THIS IS THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM 
SO THEY ARE PREPARING FOR THE WORST 
BUT IT'S NOT QUITE WE HAVE TO SEE 
THIS IN PERSPECTIVE THEY ARE 
TALKING ABOUT A SLOWDOWN IN GROWTH 
A RECESSION IN THE STATES AND 
POSSIBLY A GROWTH RECESSION IN THE 
U. K. AND EUROPE THAT IS TO SAY THAT 
OUTPUT WILL GROW MORE SLOWLY THAN 
NORMAL UNEMPLOYMENT MAY RISE 
THESE COMPARISONS WITH NINETEEN TWENTY NINE ARE A 
BIT ABSURD BETWEEN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE AND NINETEEN THIRTY TWO 
OUTPUT IN THE UNITED STATES FELL BY 
A THIRD SO FAR THEY ARE TALKING 
ABOUT A SLOWDOWN IN GROWTH 
WHY ARE 
THEY TALKING ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTY NINE I THOUGHT 
THE POINT OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS IS 
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING US 
FEEL MORE CONFIDENT 
YOU HAVE TO 
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL 
IMPLICATIONS AND THE ECONOMIC 
IMPLICATIONS IT DOES LOOK LIKE ONE 
OF THE BIGGEST FINANCIAL PANICS FOR 
DECADES IN THE IN THE WESTERN WORLD 
WE HAVE SEEN THEM IN SOUTH EAST 
ASIA IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND WE HAVE SEEN THEM 
ELSEWHERE BUT THIS IS THE BIGGEST 
ONE TO AFFECT THE U. S. U. K. AND EUROPE 
IN MOST PEOPLE'S LIFETIME AND 
CERTAINLY IN THE LIFETIME OF MOST 
OF THESE TRADERS WHO HAVE HELPED TO 
GET US HERE THAT EXPLAINS THE 
SENSE OF PANIC THE BANKING SYSTEM 
IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE ECONOMY 
EVERYBODY NEEDS A BANK EITHER TO 
DEPOSIT OR TO BORROW THE BANKING 
SYSTEM AS THE I. M. F. AND BANK FOR 
INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS HAVE 
POINTED OUT HAS NOT GOT OUT OF 
CONTROL BUT IT'S GONE PRETTY NEAR 
THE EDGE IN THE LIMITS OF SENSIBLE 
LENDING WHEN BANKS DON'T TRUST ONE 
ANOTHER AND WHEN THE RATE THEY 
DEAL AT STAYS HIGH DESPITE THE 
EFFORTS OF CENTRAL BANKS LOWER THEM 
YOU KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM YOU YOU HAVE THIS CREDIT CRUNCH ON THE ONE 
HAPPENED YOU HAVE ALSO GOT HIGH 
OIL PRICES AND RISING FOOD PRICES 
IT IS ALMOST A PERFECT ECONOMIC 
STORM THAT WE'VE GOT BREWING UP 
HERE 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS HERE IS HERE ALTHOUGH ONE WOULD HOPE THEY WILL 
DO THEIR BEST TO LIMIT THE DAMAGE 
IF FOOD PRICES ARE HIGHER YOU ARE 
YOU ARE IF YOU ARE HAVING TO MAKE 
MORE IN ORDER TO MAKE FOOD AND IF 
YOU ARE HAVING TO MAKE MORE GOODS 
IN ORDER TO IMPORT OIL AT A HIGHER 
PRICE THIS DOES AFFECT THE 
STANDARD OF LIVING WE HAVE TWO 
THINGS HERE WE HAVE A CORRECTION 
AFTER A LONG PERIOD WHEN BOTH THE 
U. S. AND U. K. WERE PROBABLY SPENDING 
TOO MUCH EUROPE WASN'T THE 
EUROZONE WAS ACTUALLY MOVING MORE 
SLOWLY WE WERE THE HARE THEY WERE 
THE TORTOISE WE PROBABLY HAVE TO 
ADJUST MORE THAN THEY DO 
THE NEWS 
FOR EUROPE AND ASIA ISN'T TOO BAD 
IT IS BRITAIN AND THE U. K. WHO ARE 
SUFFERING 
WE SEEM TO BE THE SUFFERING FOREFRONT OF IT YES 
NOW TO TURKEY WHERE THE PRISON 
POPULATION IN TURKEY IS AT AN ALL 
TIME HIGH AND THERE ARE SEVERE 
OVERCROWDING PROBLEMS SOME INMATES 
HAVE TO SLEEP IN SHIFTS AND ACCESS 
TO ACTIVITIES AND VISITORS IS 
LIMITED DUE TO A LACK OF STAFF THE 
GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO DEAL WITH 
IT BY BUILDING MODERN NEW 
FACILITIES AND INTRODUCING 
ALTERNATIVES TO CUSTODY OUR 
CORRESPONDENT HAS BEEN GIVEN ACCESS 
TO ONE OF TURKEY'S MOST NOTORIOUS 
PRISONS PRISONS THE PRISON KITCHENS IN ISTANBUL 
HAVE NEVER BEEN BUSIER BUTCHERS 
WHO ONCE CATERED FOR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED INMATES 
NOW SERVE ALMOST THREE TIMES THAT 
NUMBER THE BUILDING THEY WORK IN 
DATES BACK TO THE SIXTIES UP IN THE 
CELLS CONDITIONS ARE CRAMPED ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
MEN ARE SERVING TIME ON THIS WARD 
ORIGINALLY BUILT FOR SIXTY SPACE IS 
SO TIGHT EVEN THE CORRIDORS NOW 
HAVE THREE STOREY BEDS IN THEM THE 
B. B. C. WAS GIVEN RARE ACCESS TO ONE OF 
TURKEY'S MOST NOTORIOUS PRISONS 
NOW STRUGGLING WITH ITS LARGEST 
EVER INFLUX OF INMATES 
WE PUT UP WITH THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BUT IT'S NOT 
EASY FOR SO MANY PEOPLE TO LIVE 
TOGETHER THERE ARE ONLY TWO 
TOILETS AND INMATES GET ONE HOT 
SHOWER A WEEK 
THE OVERCROWDING 
HERE HAS GOT SO BAD THAT IN THE 
PAST YEAR THE PRISON AUTHORITIES 
HAVE HAD TO PUT IN A THIRD LAYER ON 
THE BUNK BEDS HERE THEY HAVE PUT 
IN AN EXTRA BED BETWEEN THE BUNGS 
AND RIGHT DOWN HERE UNDERNEATH THE 
BEDS THERE'S EVEN A SPARE METAL 
BED HERE TO USE IN EMERGENCIES 
CHANGES TO TURKEY'S PENAL CODE MEAN 
PRISONERS NOW SERVE LONGER BEFORE 
THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE THEY 
DO GET BY THIS IS A TOASTED 
SANDWICH PRISON STYLE BUT LEGAL 
REFORMS HAVE ALSO FORCED SOME 
TRIALS TO START AGAIN FROM SCRATCH 
ALL THAT'S PUTTING STRAIN ON THE 
PRISON SYSTEM 
WE DO 
OUR BEST BUT WE CANNOT PROVIDE ALL 
THE SERVICES WE WANT TO WE CAN 
ONLY ALLOW TWENTY MINUTES OR SO FOR 
VISITING TIME INSTEAD OF AN HOUR 
SOMETIMES WE CANNOT EVEN SEND 
PRISONERS TO COURT OR HOSPITAL 
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH STAFF 
TO ESCORT THEM 
SO THIS IS PART OF TURKEY'S 
SOLUTION BUILDING VAST NOU CAMP US 
PRISONS LIKE THIS ONE GRADUALLY 
REPLACING THE AGEING CRAMPED 
FACILITIES ELSEWHERE 
INSIDE THE NEW PRISON GOVERNOR 
SHOWS ME TO THE CRELINGS THE LARGE 
WARD SYSTEM HAS BEEN ABOLISHED 
INSTEAD EACH UNIT LIKE THIS ONE 
WILL HOUSE JUST TWENTY ONE PRISONERS THERE 
ARE LIBRARIES AND CLASSROOMS TOO 
AND SPORTS FACILITIES THAT WOULD BE 
THE ENVY OF ANY LOCAL SCHOOL ASIDE 
FROM THIS OF COURSE 
OPENING NEW PRISONS MAY NOT SEEM 
LIKE A WAY TO PREVENT CRIME BUT 
WITH ALL THE SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL 
FACILITIES HERE WE DO THINK 
INMATES WILL LEAVE REHABILITATED 
SO EVENTUALLY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
IN PRISON WILL FALL 
BACK IN THE CITY THIS IS ONE OF 
THE FIRST IN TURKEY TO EXPERIENCE 
ANOTHER REFORM THAT SHOULD HELP 
REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION HE IS 
SERVING SIX MONTHS COMMUNITY 
SERVICE FOR FIGHTING INSTEAD OF UP 
TO A YEAR BEHIND BARS HE DOESN'T 
WANT US TO SHOW HIS FACE BUT HE 
TELLS ME THAT WORKING HERE IS ONE THOUSAND 
TIMES BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE 
IT'S LIKE A FORM OF THERAPY DEM 
HE'S ACTUALLY WORKING 
AT THE OFFICES OF TURKEY'S BRAND 
NEW PROBATION SERVICE BASED ON THE 
BRITISH MODEL THE SYSTEM'S NOW IN 
PLACE ACROSS THE COUNTRY OFFICIALS 
SAY THE IDEA IS SLOWLY CATCHING ON 
FAR CHEAPER THAN PRISON IT FREES 
UP THE COURTS AND DOESN'T BREAK AN 
OFFENDER'S TIES WITH SOCIETY 
IN TURKEY IF A PERSON GOES TO PRISON ONCE HE HAS A SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT 
CHANCE OF RE OFFENDING THAT IS 
VERY HIGH THERE ARE NO STATISTICS 
FOR THE PROBATION SYSTEM YET BUT I 
AM SURE THERE WILL BE A BIG 
DIFFERENCE SO FAR NONE OF THE 
PEOPLE I HAVE DEALT WITH HAVE ENDED 
UP BACK IN COURT 
BACK AT THE 
PRISON THE INMATES ARE MARKING THE 
FINAL WEEKS IN IN THESE CONDITIONS 
THEY WILL TRANSFER TO THE NEW 
FACILITY VERY SOON BUT EXPERTS SAY 
THE REFORM MOMENTUM HERE MUST 
CONTINUE OR EVEN INTENSIFY OR 
TURKEY'S NEW BIGGER PRISONS WILL 
SOON BE FULL TOO 
LET'S GET A REMINDER NOW OF OUR 
MAIN NEWS STORIES TONIGHT 
SECURITY IS TIGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO 
WHERE THE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY IS 
DUE TO START IN JUST OVER AN HOUR 
AMID PROTESTS ON THE CITY'S STREETS 
PROTESTS WHICH HAVE MARRED OTHER 
LEGS OF THE FLAME'S TOUR SO FAR IN 
PARIS AND LONDON THE CHINESE SAY 
THE GLOBAL RELAY WILL CONTINUE 
DESPITE THE DISRUPTION AND INDEED 
IT WILL TRAVEL TO TIBET AS PLANNED 
THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND HAS 
SOME GLOOMY NEWS TODAY IT FORECAST 
THERE IS A ONE IN FOUR CHANCE THAT 
THE CURRENT TURMOIL IN THE CREDIT 
MARKETS COULD TRIGGER A GLOBAL 
RECESSION RECESSION THIS IS WORLD NEWS TODAY 
THAT'S ALL FROM THE PROGRAMME NEXT 
ON B. B. C. FOUR WE WILL HAVE THE 
WEATHER BUT FOR NOW GOODBYE 
GOOD EVENING WE HAVE HAD SOME 
BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINE IN SOUTHERN 
AREAS TODAY AND THE SHOWER CLOUD 
ELSEWHERE WILL MELT AWAY UNDER 
STARRY SKIES IT'S GOING TO BE COLD 
BUT THE FLAVOUR IS SHOWERS FOR 
TOMORROW TOMORROW HOWEVER THERE WILL BE SUBTLE 
CHANGES BECAUSE WE HAVE ATLANTIC 
AIR TAKING OVER SO ALTHOUGH WE 
WILL KEEP A TOUCH OF FROST BY NIGHT 
BY DAY TEMPERATURES COULD CREEP A 
BIT HIGHER IT WILL STILL BE COLD 
ENOUGH FOR THOSE SHOWERS TO FALL AS 
SLEET AND SNOW DURING THE NIGHT AND 
DURING THE DAY ON THURSDAY OVER THE 
HILLS BUT WE ARE EXPECTING VERY FEW 
SHOWERS FOR SOUTH EAST ENGLAND AND 
EAST ANGLIA THEY ARE MORE LIKELY 
TO CONGREGATE FURTHER NORTH WEST 
ACROSS ENGLAND AND ACROSS CENTRAL 
AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF SCOTLAND 
HOWEVER FOR THE NORTH EAST OF 
SCOTLAND WHERE IT'S BEEN COLD AND 
MISERABLE IT SHOULD BE DRIER AND 
BRIGHTER BRIGHTER PLENTY OF SHOWERS AGAIN FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND NO CHANGE HERE 
AT LEAST THERE WILL BE SUNSHINE IN 
BETWEEN THOSE SHOWERS ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND ALSO ACROSS WALES 
WILL BE HEAVY SOME WITH HAIL AND 
THUNDER IT IT LOOKS LIKE A MORE 
UNSETTLED DAY ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST 
OF ENGLAND THERE WILL BE LITTLE 
CHANGE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE 
THIS AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ANCHORS 
ITSELF OFF THE WEST COAST OF IFRLED 
AND WILL CONTINUE TO THROW SHOWERS 
OUR WAY FOR FRIDAY AND THE WEEKEND 
THERE WILL BE SOME SUNSHINE AND A 
TOUCH OF FROST FIRST THING IN THE 
MORNINGS BUT BY DAY TEMPERATURES 
WILL RECOVER 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX 
DAN CRUICKSCHANK'S ADVENTURES IN ARCHITECTURE 
WE'RE IN POMPEII AND IT'S VOLCANO DAY 
YOU SAVE PEOPLE NOT THIS TIME 
SHOW YOURSELF I MUST MAKE THE MOST TERRIBLE CHOICE 
DONNA DOCTOR
