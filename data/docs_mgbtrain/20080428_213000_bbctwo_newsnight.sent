IT'S A BIG TEST FOR ALL OF THEM ON 
THURSDAY WHICH PARTY LEADER WILL 
EMERGE AS AL WINNER TONIGHT TONIGHT THE COUNTDOWN TO THE BIGGEST TEST 
OF PUBLIC OPINION SINCE GORDON 
BROWN BECAME THE PRIME MINISTER 
THE POLLS LOOK BAD FOR LABOUR IN 
THE FIRST OF THREE SPECIAL 
INTERVIEWS WITH THE MAIN PARTIES 
WE HEAR THE GOVERNMENT VIEW 
THE AUSTRIAN HORROR STORY HOW 
COULD HE KEEP HIS DAUGHTER A 
PRISONER FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS WE SPEAK TO 
THE GAY BISHOP WHO COULD SPLIT THE 
ANGLICAN CHURCH MOVE ON CHINA AND 
INDIA HERE IS THE NEW ECONOMIC 
SUPERSTAR BRAZIL 
GOOD EVENING 
THESE ARE THE TIMES THAT TRY MENS' 
SOULS IS HOW THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
RADICAL CAMPAIGNER THOMAS PAINE 
ONCE DESCRIBED A PERIOD OF INTENSE 
POLITICAL DIFFICULTY WHATEVER THE 
STATE OF THE PRIME MINISTER THERE 
IS NO DOUBT GORDON BROWN CANNOT 
OPEN A NEWSPAPER WITHOUT READING 
AKIN TO HIS OWN POLITICAL 
SOMETHING AKIN TO HIS OWN POLITICAL OBITUARY OBITUARY THROUGHOUT THE WEEK THEREFORE WE 
HAVE OFFERED EACH OF THE MAIN 
PARTIES A CLANS TO STATE THEIR CASE 
A CHANCE TO STATE THEIR CASE 
WELL ON THURSDAY GORDON BROWN 
FACES THE BIGGEST TEST OF THE 
ELECTORATE SINCE HE ENTERED NUMBER 
TEN ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
FOUR THOUSAND ELECTORATES ARE AT STAKE 
THERE ARE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIFTEEN SEATS PLUS THE 
LORD MAYOR AND THE LONDON ASSEMBLY 
ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY FOUR SEATS IN THE DISTRICT 
COUNCILS AND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR IN THE WELSH 
COUNCILS THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE 
BEEN POLLING AHEAD OF LABOUR SINCE 
LAST OCTOBER AND THE INFAMOUS 
GENERAL ELECTION THAT WAS NOT THAT 
PICTURE HAS REMAINED LARGE LIST 
CONSISTENT SINCE THE START OF MARCH 
WITH HALF OF THE MAIN STREAM 
OPINION POLLS GIVING THE 
CONSERVATIVES A DOUBLE DIGIT LEAD 
OVER LABOUR BUT THERE IS A LOT OF 
VARIATION VARIATION REFLECTING PERHAPS A VOLATILE 
ELECTORATE ELECTORATE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR LABOUR WERE DEFENDING 
SEATS IN THE HIGH WATER MARK OF 
TONY BLAIR'S POP LAFRPLT THEY HAD A 
BAD NIGHT LOSING EIGHT COUNCILS 
AND FOUR SEVENTY NINE COUNCILLORS 
THE TORIES GAINED THIRTEEN COUNCILS AND 
TWO L. E. EIGHTY THREE COUNCILLORS 
THIS TIME LABOUR MAY DO WORSE 
SOME ARE PREDICTING A LOSS OF TWO HUNDRED 
SEATS THE TORIES WITH FALSE 
MODESTY PREDICT ONE HUNDRED PLUS GAINS IT 
IS EASY TO SEE WHY THE CLIMBDOWN 
OF THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE IS 
HURTING LABOUR HEARTLANDS LORD 
LEVY FELT THAT GORDON CANNOT DEFEAT 
CAMERON CAMERON THE CONTINUING ROW ALL OF THIS 
FEEDS INTO THE PRESSURE ON THE 
PRIME MINISTER QUESTIONS OVER 
LEADERSHIP ARE NEVER HELPFUL OVER A 
CAMPAIGN CAMPAIGN WELL THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION OUR 
POLITICAL EDITOR HAS BEEN TO 
READING WHERE IF LABOUR LOSES TWO 
SEATS THEY LOSE CONTROL OF THE 
COUNCIL FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
IT WAS A SIGN OF THE SUCCESS OF 
TONY BLAIR AND NEW LABOUR IN THE 
NINETEEN NINETIES THAT THEY MANAGED TO APPEAL 
TO MIDDLE CLASS VOTERS AND AS A 
RESULT PICKED UP LOTS OF COUNCILS 
AND PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCIES 
ACROSS SOUTHERN ENGLAND BUT TODAY 
THERE ARE ONLY THREE COUNCILS LEFT 
IN THE SOUTH OUTSIDE OF LONDON THAT 
LABOUR STILL CONTROLS READING IS 
ONE OF THEM 
TWELVE YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AT NEW 
LABOUR'S HIGH WATER MARK ELEKTRALY 
THE PARTY BOOSTED MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED 
COUNCILLORS AROUND THE COUNTRY 
THAT YEAR THEY GAINED FORTY THREE PER CENT OF THE 
VOTE BY LAST SPRING LABOUR'S 
TALLY OF COUNCILLORS HAD NEARLY 
HALVED TO UNDER FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THEY WERE 
DOWN TO JUST TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT OF THE VOTE 
SO IF YOU WENT AROUND READING TO 
SEE ANY ELECTION CAMPAIGNING YOU 
WOULD NOT FIND ANY BUT YOU TURN UP 
UNANNOUNCED ON A WEEK DAY MORNING 
EVEN IN A BATTLEGROUND LIKE THIS 
IT IS HARD TO FIND MUCH ELECTS 
YEARING GOING ON 
WE WILL STRUGGLE TO GET FILMING 
DONE THIS MORNING OR EVEN THE 
AFTERNOON THEN ONCE THE PARTIES 
HEARD THAT NEWSNIGHT WAS IN TOWN 
THING BEGAN TO HAPPEN A GANG OF 
TORIES HIT THE STREETS STRESSING 
NATIONAL ISSUES AS MUCH AS THE 
LOCAL LOCAL YOU A LEAFLET HERE HOW MUCH WILL 
YOU BE HIT BY GORDON BROWN'S TAX ON 
HARD PRESSED FAMILIES THAT IS OUT 
OF DATE NOW AFTER THE CONCESSIONS 
MADE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS 
AS YOU 
SAW ON NEWSNIGHT THERE ARE 
CONCESSIONS UNRAVELLING BEFORE OUR 
EYES EYES THEY ARE GOING TO COMPENSATE SOME 
OF THE GROUPS 
WE DON'T KNOW THAT 
JEREMY PAXMAN GOT THIS OUT OF THE 
GOVERNMENT MINISTER THE OTHER DAY 
THEY WERE NOT ENTIRELY SURE THE 
ONE THING THAT IS CLEAR ON THE 
DOORSTEP IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE 
GORDON BROWN THEY ARE TURNED OFF 
BY HIM ALSO BY THE LOCAL LABOUR 
COUNCIL HERE IN READING 
THIS WAS ONCE A STRONG LABOUR WARD 
WHERE THE TORIES DID NOT BOTHER 
HAVE YOU EVER VOTED CONSERVATIVE 
NO NOT REALLY 
WOULD YOU WOULD 
I WOULD I AM GETTING PERSUADED 
THAT IS 
KIND OF YOU LOVELY TO MEET YOU 
WHAT WOULD DECIDE IT FOR YOU 
NATIONAL OR LOCAL ISSUES LOCAL LOCAL ISSUES MAINLY I THINK 
BUT THE FACT THAT DAVID CAMERON IS 
A LOCAL LAD BERKSHIRE BORN BREAD 
AND SCHOOLED IS NOT ALWAYS AN 
ASSET ASSET THAT MAN NORMALLY VOTES 
CONSERVATIVE BUT NOT THIS TIME 
DAVID CAMERON I WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
SOMEBODY IN WORKING CLASS TO GET IN 
NOT SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN TO ALL OF 
THESE PRIVATE SCHOOLS THEY DON'T 
NOTE REAL THINGS 
LABOUR WHO HAVE RUN READING SINCE 
DAVID CAMERON WAS TEENAGER FOR TWENTY TWO 
YEARS HAVE BEEN LEAFLETING OVER 
THE FATE OF A LOCAL WATER MEADOW 
THEIR HOPE IS THAT THE VOTERS WILL 
FORGET GORDON BROWN AND THE TEN 
PENCE TAX RATE 
WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT A LOCAL 
CAMPAIGN I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT 
THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICY WHAT 
WE ARE SAYING THIS IS ABOUT WHICH 
IS THE BEST PARTY TO RUN READING 
COUNCIL COUNCIL DO YOU ACCEPT THIS ARGUMENT TO RUN 
IT ON LOCAL ISSUES RATHER THAN THE 
NATIONAL 
I THINK NATIONAL L. WILL NATIONAL NOT GET INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH YOU 
SO YOU THINK PERHAPS IT IS GIVING 
THE GOVERNMENT KICK THAT IS A 
GOOD IDEA 
WITHOUT A DOUBT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK MADAM 
I'M NOT 
INTERESTED INTERESTED YOU ARE NOT INTO IT YOU WILL BE 
VOTING ON THURSDAY 
I LEAVE IT TO 
HIM I ALWAYS DO 
REALLY IN THIS DAY AND AGE YEAH YEAH THIS MAN TOO REFUSES TO THINK 
LOCAL AS LABOUR IN READING 
DESPERATELY WANT 
I THINK THAT LABOUR HAS DONE A 
REALLY REALLY BAD JOB 
THIS GENTLEMAN IS THE LOM 
COUNCILLOR HE IS ARGUING YOU 
SHOULD DECIDE YOUR VOTE ACCORDING 
TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LOCAL 
COUNCIL HE IS PROUD OF THAT MY MY MIND IS MADE UP IT WILL NOT BE 
CHANGED SEVEN YEARS HOWEVER LONG 
IT HAS BEEN SINCE LABOUR HAS BEEN 
IN GOVERNMENT I AM NOT FOR IT 
ANYMORE I'M AFRAID 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY 
WE WORK 
HARD TO REPRESENT THE LOCAL PEOPLE 
IN TERMS OF VALUE FOR MONEY WE HAVE 
A ONE THE NINETEEN PER CENT COUNCIL TAX RISE 
THAT IS LOW IN COMPARISON WITH THE 
NEIGHBOURS NEIGHBOURS APART FROM WHEN THE PARTIES AGREED 
TO MEET UP WITH US IT HARDLY SEEM 
AS HOT BED OF POLITICAL AKNIFT 
READING EVEN THOUGH IT IS 
ACTIVITY IN READING EVEN THOUGH IT 
IS ONE OF THE MOST BIGGEST CONTESTS 
WE HAVE BEEN HERE NINE HOURS IF 
YOU WERE A MARTIAN YOU WOULD NOT 
KNOW IF THERE WAS A LOCAL ELECTION 
TAKING PLACE THIS POSTER HERE AND 
ONE NEXT DOOR TO IT FOR THE GREEN 
PARTY ARE THE FIRST WE HAVE SEEN 
ALL DAY 
IN THIS WARD A LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
TARGET THE GREENS THREATEN THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS'S QUEST TO HANG 
ON TO THE BALANCE OF POWER OVER THE 
WEEKEND WEEKEND WHAT ABOUT THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
EVERY THOUGHT OF VOTING FOR THEM I I HAVE IN THE PAST NOT THIS TIME 
HERE IS THE CHANCE TO PERSUADE YOU 
THAT VOTING GREEN IS A WASTE OF 
TIME 
YOU CAN TRY I WILL GIVE YOU TIME TEN SECONDS 
WE WILL HAVE ALMOST 
CERTAINLY IN READING A HUNG COUNCIL 
NEITHER THE TORIES NOR LABOUR WILL 
HAVE CONTROL THERE WILL BE A 
STRONG GROUP OF LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
ABLE TO WIELD INFLUENCE WITH MANY 
THINGS INCLUDING THE LOCAL 
ENVIRONMENT DO YOU NOT THINK THAT 
THE AREA COULD GET A BETTER DEAL 
WITH HAVING A LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ON 
THE TEAM 
I BELIEVE BY VOTING GREEN 
I AM MAKING A STATEMENT 
IF THE OPPOSITION PARTIES OF 
VARIOUS COLOURS COMBINE DO PUT 
LABOUR TO FLIGHT HERE IT MAY 
REFLECT S. INCREASINGLY 
POLARISED GEOGRAPHY 
THERE COULD BE A BREAKTHROUGH IN 
THE NORTH OF ENGLAND BUT IN THE 
SOUTH OUTSIDE OF LONDON THAT IS 
LABOUR COUNCILLORS COULD FIND 
THEMSELVES RARE SPECIES EVER 
MORE EXCLUDED FROM LOCAL TOWN HALLS 
THERE HAS BEEN VOTE ON THE TEN 
PENCE TAX WHERE DID THAT GO 
TONIGHT WAS TO BE THE VOTE ON THE 
BACKBENCH FRANK FIELD AAMENDMENT 
BUT THE CONSERVATIVES PUT DOWN AN 
AMENDMENT WITH THE MAJORITY OF FORTY THREE 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT WINNING THIS 
WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE M. P.'S THE POWER 
TO LOOK AT THE CHANCELLOR'S 
COMPENSATION PACKAGE WHEN IT IS 
ANNOUNCED IN THE AUTUMN TO DECIDE 
WHETHER THEY LIKE IT IF THEY DID 
NOT LIKE IT TO BRING BACK THE TEN 
PENCE TAX BAND BUT THE GOVERNMENT 
WON THAT VOTE TONIGHT 
IN EXCHANGES TOWARDS THE END OF THE 
DEBATE THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY 
JANE KENNEDY REFUSED TO BE DRAWN ON 
WEATHER THE COMPENSATION PACKAGE 
WOULD COMPENSATE ALL LOSERS FROM 
THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN PENCE RATE 
SHE REFUSED TO BE DRAWN TO SOME 
JEERS FROM THE OPPOSITION FRANK 
FIELD GOT UP AND SAID THAT LABOUR 
M. P.'S UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL GROUPS 
WOULD BE COMPENSATED IF NOT THEY 
MAY TROURN THE STATE SO THE THREAT 
IS HANGING OVER GORDON BROWN AND 
ALISTAIR DARLING 
BUT THE THREAT IS THERE BUT 
TEMPORARY RELIEF IT IS GOOD 
RELIEF FOR HIM 
HE WENT AWAY IN 
TERMS OF THE DEBATE BUT CONTINUING 
PROBLEMS FROM LORD LEVY'S MEMOIRS 
AND WHATEVER TONY BLAIR DID OR DID 
DID NOT SAY AND A POLL GIVING THE 
CONSERVATIVES A FOURTEEN PER CENT LEAD OVER 
LABOUR FORTY TO TWENTY SIX SOMEWHAT IN LINE 
TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE RANGE OF THE 
RECENT POLLS SO IT IS NOT LOOKING 
LIKE A GOOD RESULT ON THURSDAY FOR 
THE GOVERNMENT 
AND CONCERN ABOUT ELECTORAL FRAUD 
THE REPORT BY THE JOSEPH ROWNTREE 
FOUNDATION ON THE VOTING SYSTEM 
REFLECTING THE CONCERNS RAISED BY A 
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND 
GROUPS OVER THE LAST YEAR OR TWO 
ABOUT THE VOTING SYSTEM AND THE 
PREV LENS OF FRAUD SINCE POSTAL 
VOTING ON DEMAND WAS INTRODUCED 
EIGHT YEARS AGO IN COMBINATION WITH 
CONCERNS ABOUT HOW EASY IT IS TO 
FRAUDULENTLY REGISTER FALSE NAMES 
ON THE ELECTORAL REGISTER IT IS A 
COMBINATION THAT THE FRUST HAVE 
EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT IT 
WE WILL BE RUNNING A SERIES OF 
INTERVIEWS INTERVIEWS TONIGHT FROM THE LABOUR PARTY THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR COMMUNITIES 
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAZEL BLEARS 
IT MUST BE DIFFICULT BEING IN 
GOVERNMENT THREE DAYS BEFORE THE 
VERY IMPORTANT ELECTIONS WHEN YOU 
ARE IN A POSITION OF LEADERSHIP IN 
A PARTY WHICH IS SO DIVIDED AND SO 
DEMORALISED 
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR DEMORALISED ANY GOVERNMENT MEDIUM TERM 
ELECTIONS THE ELECTORATE ARE ARE 
BOUND TO HAVE THEIR CONCERNS IT IS 
SAFE TO HAVE A GO AT THE GOVERNMENT 
AT THIS POINT BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT 
GOING TO GET RID OF OF YOUR LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT AND WE HAVE BEEN HERE 
BEFORE AND IT IS TOUGH IN 
GOVERNMENT PEOPLE KNOW THAT BUT 
THE WAY YOU JUDGE A GOVERNMENT IS 
BY HOW IT BEHAVES AT DIFFICULT 
TIMES KEEPING OUR NERVE GETTING 
OUT THERE ON THE DOORSTEP AND 
LISTENING TO PEOPLE'S CONCERNS 
KEEPING YOUR NERVE WHEN DID YOU 
START KEEPING YOUR NERVE 
I THINK 
THIS GOVERNMENT HAS A PROUD RECORD 
OF KEEPING OUR NERVE BUT AT THE 
SAME TIME BEING IN TOUCH 
YOU BACK DOWN TO PRESSURE FROM 
BACKBENCHERS WHEN FRANK FIELD BACKS 
A REBELLION YOU BACK DOWN WE WE LISTEN TO THE PUBLIC AND I HAVE 
BEEN OUT ON THE DOORSTEPS FOR THE 
PAST MONTH OR SO LISTENING TO WHAT 
PEOPLE HAVE SAID AND ON THE TEN 
PENCE TAX RATE PEOPLE WERE 
CONCERNED AND THEY HAVE GOT A 
GOVERNMENT THAT LICENCE TO THAT AND 
ACTS ON THEIR CONCERNS AND THAT'S 
WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS TO SEE FROM 
POLITICIANS POLITICIANS AMONG THE PEOPLE YOU LISTEN TO DO 
YOU LISTEN TO PETER PETER MANDELSON 
SAYING THE PARTY LOST ITS WAY OR 
LORD LEVY SAYING GORDON BROWN CAN'T 
DEFEAT DAVID CAMERON 
I LISTEN TO 
THE PEOPLE IN SOUTHAMPTON IN 
PORTSMOUTH NORTH WALES IN 
LIVERPOOL IN SALFORD AND I THINK 
THAT THE BIGGEST THING THAT PEOPLE 
WANT FROM THEIR POLITICIANS IS A 
SENSE THAT THEY ARE IN TOUCH U. THEY 
UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC ECONOMIC 
PRESSURES PEOPLE ARE UNDER WITH THE 
COST OF LIVING AND YOU ARE PREPARED 
TO ACT ON THEIR CONCERNS THAT'S 
WHAT THEY WANT FROM POLITICIANS 
ANOTHER POLITICIAN YOU DON'T 
LISTEN TO CHARLES CLARKE WHO SAID 
IT IS TRUE THAT MANY LABOUR M. P.'S ARE 
DISAPPOINTED BY POLICY DECISIONS 
SUCH AS THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN 
PENCE RATE OF TAX THE POST OFFICE 
CLOSURE AND LACK OF PREPARATION 
FOR NORTHERN ROCK YOU DON'T LISTEN 
TO TO THOSE 
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR 
POLITICIANS TO LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE 
WHO PAY OUR WAGES THE TAXPAYERS OF 
THIS COUNTRY THE PEOPLE WHO WANT 
TO SEE A LABOUR GOVERNMENT CARRY ON 
WITH THE KIND OF POLICIES THAT 
IMPROVED EDUCATION HOUSING AND 
THE ECONOMY IN THIS COUNTRY IT IS 
A DIFFICULT TIME WE ARE GOING 
THROUGH GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURBULENCE 
BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL GET 
THROUGH THIS PERIOD AND PEOPLE WILL 
SEE THAT IT IS A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
PREPARED TO STICK IN FOR THE LONG 
TERM MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS AND 
THAT'S WHAT GORDON BROWN HAS DONE 
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS AND THAT 
PEOPLE WILL THEN SEE SEE WE COME 
OUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS AND WE 
HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY THAT'S WHAT 
PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
BRED AND BUTTER ISSUE THE BREAD 
AND BUTTER ISSUES I HAVE BEEN UP 
AND TOWN DOWN THE COUNTRY WE HAVE 
SEEN BRILLIANT LOCAL PARTIES 
WHATEVER MICHAEL CRICK SAYS ABOUT 
READINGS WE HAVE A FLOURISHING 
ECONOMY IN READING PEOPLE ARE AT 
WORK BUT THE PARTY IS ACTIVE ON 
THE GROUND 
ISN'T YOUR REAL PROBLEM THAT THE 
PRIME MINISTER IS SEEN AS WEAK AND 
THE WEAKER HE IS SEEN THE MORE 
PEOPLE WILL PUSH HIM 
NO I DON'T THINK THAT AT ALL WHAT 
YOU HAVE GOT IN GORDON BROWN IS A 
MAN WHO FEELS PASSIONATELY ABOUT 
TACKLING POVERTY THAT'S WHY IT IS 
IRONIC WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST 
COUPLE OF WEEKS 
IRONIC HE HAS TRIED TO DIG HIMSELF 
OUT OF THE WEAKNESSES GUEST 
HERE SAID THEY THEY THINK THEY CAN 
PUSH GORDON BROWN INTO HIGHER PAY 
SETTLEMENTS BECAUSE HE HAS FLIP 
FLOPPED ON THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
AND OTHER THINGS 
AND WHAT YOU HAVE 
SEEN FROM GORDON BROWN OVER THE 
LAST TEN YEARS IS AN IRON 
DETERMINATION TO SQUEEZE OUT 
INPLAGUES FROM OUR ECONOMY TO KEEP 
OUR INTEREST RATES LOW AND TO KEEP 
UNEMPLOYMENT LOW 
THE LOW PAID WORKERS AND CIVIL 
CIVIL SERVE SERVE SERVE WANTS WON'T 
GET AN ABOVE INFLATION PAY RISE 
THE TORIES SAID THIS WOULD COST ONE 
MILLION JOBS AND THE NATIONAL 
MINIMUM WAGE HELPED HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO GET A 
DESCENT LEVEL OF PAY 
WILL YOU LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO 
DON'T WANT FORTY TWO DAYS DETENTION 
JACQUI SMITH HAS BEEN ENGAGED FOR 
MONTHS LISTENING TO MEMBERS OF 
PARLIAMENT TO MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE 
OF LORDS PEOPLE IN THE SECURITY 
SERVICES PEOPLE IN THE POLICE THE 
PUBLIC AND WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN IS A 
SIGNIFICANT SHIFT FROM THE ORIGINAL 
PROPOSALS SO THAT YOU HAVE A SERIES 
OF OF SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE AND WHAT 
THE PUBLIC WANT TO SEE IS A 
GOVERNMENT THAT WANTS TO KEEP THEM 
SAFE AND AT THE SAME TIME MAKE SURE 
THAT WE BALANCE CIVIL LIBERTIES 
WITH THAT 
WHAT FURTHER CONCESSIONS MIGHT YOU 
MAKE TAGS HAS BEEN SUGGESTED 
JACQUI SMITH AS HOME SECRETARY WILL 
CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE THE 
DISCUSSIONS HAVE GONE ON THERE HAS 
BEEN MOVEMENT YOU HAVE GOT THE 
HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE NOT 
KNOWN AS TOWED INTO THE GOVERNMENT 
SAYING THERE HAS BEEN SHIFT HERE IN 
TERMS OF WHERE THE ORIGINAL 
PROPOSALS WHERE 
MAYBE FURTHER 
JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT FOR EXAMPLE 
WELL LORD CARLILE HAS BEEN 
SUPPORTING THE ORIGINAL 
CLEARLY YOU NEED GOOD JUDICIAL 
OVERSIGHT BECAUSE WE ARE COUNTRY 
PROUD OF OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES BUT 
WHERE THE PUBLIC ARE PEOPLE WANT A 
GOVERNMENT THAT IS PREPARED TO ACT 
TAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS KEEP THEM 
SAFE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND 
BALANCE CIVIL LIB LIB ESHES 
LIBERTIES 
DO YOU THINK AFTER ELEVEN YEARS 
THEY ARE TRIED OF LABOUR THEY WANT 
A CHANGE 
NO I DON'T THINK THAT'S 
WHERE THE PUBLIC ARE 
IT IS WHERE THE 
POLLS ARE THE THE POLLS ARE BOUND TO BE IN A 
DIFFICULT POSITION YOU HAVE A 
DIFFICULT ECONOMY AND WHEN PEOPLE 
ARE WORRIED ABOUT HOUSE PRICES AND 
THE COST OF LIVING WHO ARE YOU 
GOING TO BLAME YOU WILL BLAME THE 
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT YOU SAID THE ECONOMY IS STRONG A 
MINUTE AGO 
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE 
ECONOMY ARE STRONG 
WHY ARE WE SO STUPID WE DON'T SEE 
IT 
I DON'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE IT STUPID THE PUBLIC ARE BRIGHTER AND 
AND CLEV ERIC RUBLOVSKIS CLEV 
CLEVERER THAN WE GIVE THEM CREDIT 
FOR FOR IT IS WASHING OVER INTO OUR ECONOMY 
BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT UNDER THE 
TORIES THEY HAVE THREE MILLION 
MILLION PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED 
MORTGAGES AT FIFTEEN PER CENT COST OF LIVING 
OUT OF CONTROL PEOPLE REMEMBER 
THAT AND WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT A 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT WE HAVE MADE 
TOUGH DECISION AND WE HAVE SQUEEZED 
INFLATION AS FAR AS WE CAN OUT OF 
THIS ECONOMY AND THAT'S WHAT WE 
WANT TO SEE CARRYING ON 
DO YOU ACCEPT IF YOU LOSE THE 
LONDON MAYORAL ELECTION THAT WOULD 
BE A CATASTROPHE 
THE MAYOR 
ELECTION IS TIGHT 
IT IS IT IS NECK AND NECK 
BUT AT THIS STAGE AS YOU GET 
TOWARDS THURSDAY PEOPLE ARE 
THINKING DO I WANT TO VOTE FOR BAR 
FOR BORIS JOHNSTON TO BE IN CHARGE 
MAYBE THEY WILL 
HOW BIG DEAL 
WOULD IT FOR YOU IT WOULD BE A CATASTROPHE TO LOSE 
CONTROL OF THE MAYORALITY OF THE 
BIGGEST CITY IN THIS ONE 
THE KA 
TAS THE CATASTROPHE WOULD BE TO 
HAVE BORIS JOHNSON CONTROL 
I THINK IT IS IT IS TIGHT MY 
MESSAGE TO MEMBERS IN LONDON IS TO 
GET OUT THERE GET ON THE DOORSTEP 
LET'S CARRY ON THE CAMPAIGN AND 
MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE BORIS 
JOHNSON IN CHARGE OF THE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE AFTER THURSDAY 
DO YOU THINK YOUR SHARE OF THE VOTE 
MIGHT BE LESS THAN THIRTY PER CENT AS ONE OF 
THE OPINION POLLS SUGGESTED LESS 
THAN THIRTY PER CENT 
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
ON THURSDAY THAT'S THE VOTE THAT 
MATTERS HERE IF YOU THINK ABOUT 
WHERE THE TORIES WERE WE WON THE 
LAST SET OF ELECTIONS BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
WITH A FORTY PER CENT SHARE OF THE VOTE THEY 
ARE NOWHERE NEAR THAT AND I HAVE A 
SENSE THAT PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW 
FEELING THE SQUEEZE FEELING THE 
PINCH THEY WANT TO PUT PRESSURE ON 
US BUT THEY HAVE NOT SEALED THE 
DEAL WITH DAVID CAMERON THEY 
REALLY HAVE NOT HE HAS NOT WON 
THEM OVER 
ARE THERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IN 
WHICH GORDON BROWN WOULD TAKE A 
REAL NO FROM THE VOTERS AS A SIGN 
THAT HE MAYBE SHOULD QUIT NO NO WE'RE IN A POSITION 
HE WILL STAY 
WHATEVER THE VOTE IS 
WE ARE HERE 
FOR THE LONG TERM THIS IS THE 
THIRD TERM OF A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
IT HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN IN HISTORY 
BEFORE AND WE ARE IN THERE WE HAVE 
SERIOUS POLICY ON HOUSING ON 
EDUCATION TO CARRY ON IMPROVING 
THE LIVES OF THE ORDINARY HARD 
WORKING FAMILIES OF THIS COUNTRY L. 
THINK THEY ARE STILL WITH US THEY 
HAVE COMPLAINTS ABOUT INDIVIDUAL 
INDIVIDUAL POLICIES BUT THERE IS 
TO SENSE OF A SEISMIC SHIFT TO THE 
TORIES DAVID CAMERON HAS NOT 
SEALED THAT DEAL WITH THE BRITISH 
PUBLIC AND WE HAVE EVERYTHING TO 
WORK FOR LET'S GET OUT THERE ON 
THURSDAY AND VOTE ON THURSDAY 
L. N. THE NEXT TWO PROGRAMMES WE WILL 
BE DOING LOCAL ELECTION INTERVIEWS 
WITH LEADING SHADOW CABINET 
MEMBER AND NICK CLEGG 
NOW IT IS A TALE OF RAPE INCEST 
AND KIDNAPPING AND IT HAS BEEN 
CALLED AUSTRIA'S HOUSE OF HORRORS 
IN AMSTETTEN WHERE A MAN MAN KEPT 
HIS DAUGHTER PRISONER AND FATHERED 
CHILDREN BY HER 
I'M JOINED FROM AMSTETTEN BY STEVE 
ROSENBERG ROSENBERG STEVE WHAT'S THE LATEST ON THIS 
INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATION WELL HERE IN AMSTETTEN THERE IS A 
SENSE OF SHOCK I HAVE TO TELL YOU 
GAVIN THIS IS A SMALL SLEEPY 
AUSTRIAN TOWN THE FLOWER SHOP IS 
ACROSS THE ROAD THERE IS A CAFE ON 
THE CORNER AND NEXT TO THE CAFE 
THE HOUSE OF HORROR THE SCENE OF 
AUSTRIA'S WORST CRIME IN HISTORY 
AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COME TO GO 
THIS PLACE ALL DAY RESIDENTS OF 
THE TOWN ARE STANDING AND STARING 
AT THIS PLACE IN DISBELIEF THEY 
CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN 
HEARING AND SEEING ON LOCAL 
TELEVISION I SPOKE TO SOME OF THE 
NEIGHBOURS ON THIS STREET A LADY 
CALLED HILDA SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT 
THAT THE SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD WHO HAS BEEN 
ACCUSED OF LOCKING UP AND SEXUALLY 
ABUSING HIS DAUGHTER WAS A 
GENTLEMAN BUT EARLIER TODAY 
AUSTRIAN POLICE CONFIRMED THAT HE 
HAD CONFESSED TO HIS CRIMES 
HIS DAUGHTER AT THE TIME EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WAS SELECTED BY 
HIM AND LOCKED HIS IN HIS CELLAR 
HE ADMITTED TO THAT HE ALSO 
ADMITTED THAT HE PRESSURISED HER 
THERE BEAT HER THERE HE 
INCARCERATED HER AGAINST HER WILL 
AND HE AT HE ADMITTED THAT HE 
COMMITTED SEXUAL ACTS ON HIS 
DAUGHTER A NUMBER OF TIMES 
DO LOCAL PEOPLE THERE IN THAT SMALL 
TOWN STEVE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW THIS 
MAN COULD HAVE GOT AWAY WITH IT FOR 
SO LONG 
THAT IS THE QUESTION 
PEOPLE ARE ASKING THEMSELVES FOR 
TWENTY FOUR YEARS THIS MAN'S DAUGHTER WAS 
LOCKED UP IN THE BASEMENT BEING 
SEXUALLY ABUSED FATHERING HIS 
CHILDREN AND NOBODY HERE KNEW ABOUT 
IT I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL 
REASONS HERE FOR ONE THING THE 
MOTHER OF THE DAUGHTER SHE WAS LED 
TO BELIEVE THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD 
RUNAWAY FROM HOME THE BASEMENT IN 
WHICH SHE HAVE HAD BEEN KEPT WAS 
HIDDEN AWAY IT WAS SECRET THERE 
WAS A CONCRETE DOOR HIDING THE 
ENTRANCE TO THE CELLAR DOWN BELOW 
VERY VERY DEEP DOWN BELOW WAS THIS 
NETWORK OF PASSAGE WAYS AND 
CHAMBERS THERE WAS A LIVING AREA 
VERY SMALL LIVING AREA TO WASH 
THESE WERE THE BLEAK CONDITIONS IN 
WHICH THIS WOMAN HAD BEEN KEPT FOR 
TWENTY FOUR YEARS EARLIER TODAY A POLICE 
CHIEF WENT INTO THE CELLAR HE SAID 
SAID TOFFS SO DEEP IT WAS SO DEEP 
EVEN IF YOU CRIED VERY VERY LOUD 
NO ONE WOULD HEAR 
STEVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW THIS SUMMER IN ONCE IN A 
DECADE EVENT THE THE ANGLICAN 
CHURCH WILL COME TOGETHER FOR THE 
LAMBETH CONFERENCE 
ONE BISHOP HAS NOT BEEN FORMALLY 
INVITED BISHOP GENE ROBINSON WILL 
CELEBRATE HIS 
GAY WEDDING 
BEFORE THE 
CONFERENCE AND TAKE PART 
ON THE 
FRINGES 
WE WILL 
HEAR THE 
BISHOP'S STORY IN 
A MOMENT 
A MOMENT 
A MOMENT ONCE EVERY TEN YEARS THERE IS 
RELIGIOUS SUMMIT MEETING OF THE 
WORLD'S ANGLICAN BISHOPS IT IS 
CALLED THE ANGLICAN CONFERENCE 
THOUGH IT IS HELD IN CANTERBURY IT 
FOCUSES ON BIBLE STUDY AND PRAYER 
INSTEAD IT WILL BE SURELY DOMINATED 
BY ONE ISSUE AND ONE MAN GAY 
CLERGY AND GENE ROBINSON HE'S THE 
BISHOP OF NEW HAMPSHIRE IN THE 
STATES HE'S OPENLY GAY AND 
INTENDS TO MARRY HIS PARTNER JUNE HE HAS 
NOT BEEN 
INVITED TO 
CANTERBURY HE 
WILL STILL 
BE THERE 
CONFINED TO THE MARKET PLACE 
PUBLIC AREA 
FOR FRINGE 
GROUPS IT 
IS A DECISION THAT CALLS INTO 
QUESTION THE AUTHORITY AND JUDGMENT 
OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
ALTHOUGH IRONICALLY HE'S PERCEIVED 
AS LIBERAL BY ALL IN THE ANGLICAN 
COMMUNITY HIS AIM IS TO PREVENT 
THE CHURCH SPLITING ON THE ISSUE OF 
HOMOSEXUALITY THAT SPLIT HAS 
HAPPENED ALREADY THE WORLD'S 
FASTEST GROWING ANGLICAN COMMUNITY 
IS IN NIGERIA WHERE THE ARCHBISHOP 
IS FURIOUS FOR THE CHURCH IN THE U. S. 
FOR ORDAINING THE BISHOP SAYING 
THE BIBLE SAYS HOMOSEXUALITY IS 
WRONG HE HAS REFUSED TO GO TO 
CANTERBURY AND WILL GO TO THE 
RIVAL CONFERENCE IN JORDAN AND 
JERUSALEM THERE ARE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED 
ANGLICAN BISHOP AND A QUARTER ARE 
EXPECTED TO BOYCOTT CANTERBURY IN 
FAVOUR OF THE RIVAL CONFERENCE TO 
ADD TO THE BITTER DEBATE GENE 
ROBINSON HAS WRITTEN A NEW BOOK IN 
IT HE ARGUES 
BISHOP GENE ROBINSON IS WITH ME NOW 
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME 
DO YOU ACCEPT THAT CALLING YOUR 
BOOK I IN THE EYE OF THE STORM 
DIFFERENT BECAUSE SOME SAY YOU ARE 
THE STORM 
THE BOOK IS WHETHER THE 
STORM IN 
THE ANGLICAN 
COMMUNITY 
WHETHER WE WILL WEATHER IT OR NOT 
THAT STORM IS AROUND ME THE AIM OF 
THE BOOK IS TO ATTEST TO GOD'S 
GOODNESS AND KEEPING ME CALM IN CENTRE OF 
THE STORM 
THAT 
IS FINE 
THAT IS FINE FOR YOU 
BUT FOR 
THE CHURCH 
DO 
YOU ACCEPT 
ALSO THAT 
SOME OF 
THINGS 
YOU SAY 
YOU SAY 
IN 
THE BOOK 
THAT YOU 
ALWAYS WANTED 
TO BE A JUNE 
BRIDE THAT TO SOME PEOPLE IS 
DELIBERATELY PROVOCATIVE 
IT MIGHT 
BE BUT LET'S UNDERSTAND WHAT COMMENT WAS 
ABOUT GAY 
AND 
KIDS ARE GROWING UP RIGHT HERE IN 
ENGLAND TODAY AND FOR THE FIRST 
TIME EVER 
THEY CAN 
IMAGINE 
WHAT I 
NEVER COULD IMAGINE 
AS A 
GROWING 
UP THAT 
I COULD BE HAPPY 
AND BLESSED BY 
THE CHURCH 
IN MY 
RELATIONSHIP WITH MY PARTNER OF TWENTY 
YEARS 
DO YOU RELISH THE TENSION YEARS THAT THIS CAUSES 
NO I DON'T THE 
PAIN THAT THIS HAS CAUSED IS DEEPLY 
TROUBLING TO ME BUT YOU KNOW WHAT 
PAIN IS NOT SHOULD NOT BE A 
SURPRISE TO CHRISTIANS 
JESUS SAYS 
THAT EVERY 
TIME THAT 
WE TRY 
TO 
FOLLOW IN GOD'S WAY WE WILL PAY A 
PRICE 
GETTING MARRIED BEFORE THE PRICE ONCE IN A DECADE 
I'M NOT GETTING 
MARRIED I'M HAVING A CIVIL UNION 
IT'S NOT A MARRIAGE 
YOU ACCEPT 
THERE IS A DISTINCTION DESPITE 
WHAT SOME OF THE NEWSPAPERS CALL IT 
THAT IS 
DELIBERATELY PROVOCATIVE TO 
DO IT 
THE 
SUMMER BEFORE 
THE 
ONCE IN 
TEN YEAR LAMBETH CONFERENCE FOR 
SOME PEOPLE LY 
TELL YOU WHY DOING IT 
I WILL 
COME 
TO THE 
LAMBETH 
CONFERENCE AND 
THERE HAVE 
ALREADY BEEN THREATS AGAINST ME AND 
OTHERS AND PHYSICAL THREATS THREATS ABSOLUTELY I WILL NOT COME TO THE 
LAMBETH CONFERENCE AND PUT MY OWN 
LIFE AT RISK AND LEAVE MY PARTNER 
AND MY FAMILY AT RISK WITHOUT 
PUTTING IN 
PLACE THE 
PROTECTIONS 
THAT ARE 
OFFERED TO ME 
THROUGH A 
CIVIL UNION THAT'S WHAT ANY WIFE 
OR 
HUSBAND WOULD 
DO 
FOR THEIR 
SPOUSE 
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE SPOUSE THREATENING YOU I'M REALLY 
SURPRISED THAT PEOPLE WITHIN THE 
ANGLICAN COMMUNION ARE THREATENING 
A BISHOP 
OF THAT 
COMMUNION BECAUSE OF DISAGREEMENT IF YOU HAVE 
READ THE 
DISAGREEMENT PAPERS LATELY YOU WILL KNOW ARE 
THREATS AGAINST 
GAY 
AND LESBIAN 
PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD 
PARTICULARLY IN 
COUNTRIES WHERE IT 
IS ILLEGAL

CONFERENCE IS SUPPOSED 
TO BE ABOUT BIBLE STUDY PRAYER AND 
DISCUSSION 
FOR SOME 
PEOPLE 
WILL 
BE THE GAY SEX CONFERENCE IT IT WON'T 
DOING THAT

THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING IN THE 
ANGLICAN COMMUNION BUT I BELIEVE

BE ABOUT 
STUDY AND DISCUSSIONS 
INCREASING THE BONDS OF AFFECTION 
I WILL 
BE THERE 
MAKING 
A WITNESS 
FOR 
THOSE WHO 
WANT TO 
FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN 
THEIR LIVES SIT WITH 
SOMEONE WHO IS UNASHAMEDLY GAY AND 
UNASHAMEDLY ANGLICAN AND TALK 
ABOUT SEXUALITY AND SPIR 
SPIRITUALITY GOING HAND IN HAND 
T. H. E. ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY HAS AN 
IMPOSSIBLE TASK ABOUT PEOPLE REALLY 
CARE ABOUT 
THIS BUT 
TAKE 
VERY 
DIFFERENT VIEW 
FROM YOU AND 
THE PEOPLE ON YOUR SIDE HOW CAN 
YOU POSSIBLY RESOLVE THIS QUEST 
QUESTION AND ON BOTH SIDES CITE 
SCRIPTURE 
I DEEPLY CARE ABOUT THIS SCRIPTURE AS WELL IT IS NOT JUST THE 
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY AND THE 
AFRICAN WE ALL LOVE ANGLICANISM

MASSIVE DE DIVERSE UNEXPECTED 
HOVERING BETWEEN THE DEVELOPED AND 
DEVELOPING WORLDS IF IT IS

SKYSCRAPERS TO MAKE MANHATTEN LOOK

FUTURE WHICH 
THE 
WORLD 
WOULD HAVE 
TO TAKE SERIOUS 
AND WHICH 
MIGHT WELL 
THREATEN MORE 
ESTABLISHED

THE FOUR 
COUNTRIES IN 
QUESTION ARE 
IN REVERSE ORDER CHINA INDIA 
RUSSIA AND BRAZIL 
BUT DOES BRAZIL REALLY BELONG IN 
SUCH AUGUSTE COMPANY IS IT REALLY 
A BRIC COMPARABLE TO THE LIKES OF 
INDIA AND CHINA WE ASKED CHAIRMAN OF ONE OF 
BRAZIL'S MAIN 
INVESTMENT BANKS

INVESTMENT BANKS TO LEAD US THROUGH THE MAIZE THAT IS THE 
BRAZILIAN ECONOMY DOES HE MAZE 
THAT IS THE 
BRAZILIAN ECONOMY 
DOES

LABEL 
YES DEFINITELY IT IS THE LABEL JUNIOR RANKS BUT GOING 
UP IT IS AN 
ECONOMY THAT IS GROWING STABLE DOES FIT THE 
BILL OF 
GROWING VAST 
POPULATION AND 
ALSO VAST NATURAL 
RESOURCES POOL 
THE RISING 
BRAZILIAN STOCK MARKET MIRRORS THIS 
ECONOMIC OPTIMISIM WITH SHARE 
PRICES GROWING WELL OVER FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT IN 
THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND BARELY 
REGISTERING A BLIP IN THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH COMPARE THAT TO THE F. T. S. E. 
WHICH IN THE SAME PERIOD GREW BY 
LESS THAN FIFTEEN PER CENT 
MUCH OF 
BRAZIL'S 
GROWTH IS DRIVEN BY NATURAL 
RESOURCES THE COUNTRY HAS AN 
EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES IN SAO 
PAULO'S FAMOUS MARKET PLACE FOOD 
IS VIRTUALLY REGARDED AS A RELIGION 
AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN GROWING BY FIFTEEN PER CENT 
A YEAR DRIVEN BY CHINA'S HUGE 
APPETITE SOYA TAKES THE LION'S

AND ETHANOL 
FOR FUEL 
GROWS ON LAND 
THE SIZE OF ENGLAND THEN THERE IS 
IRON ORE COFFEE LEATHER AND 
RECENTLY DISCOVERED 
MASSIVE OIL 
RECENTLY DISCOVERED MASSIVE OIL FIELD THE LIST GOES ON

HERE IS A PERFECT SYMBOL OF ALL 
THAT RICHNESS ON EVERY CORNER YOU 
CAN GET FRESHLY SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE ON EVERY CORNER ORANGE JUICE 
ISN'T THE 
ONLY TREAT A GIRL CAN BUY 
IN DOWN TOWN SAO PAULO THERE 
SHORTAGE OF 
MONEY TO SPEND AND THE 
BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE ARE CERTAINLY NOT 
COY ABOUT SPENDING IT SIXTY THOUSAND NEW 
DOLLAR MILLIONAIRES WERE CREATED 
LAST YEAR ALONE 
BUT THAT'S 
FAR 
FROM REALITY FOR MOST BRAZILIANS 
THE MAJOR CITIES ARE LITTERED WITH 
FARVELLAS EFFECTIVELY SLUMS THE 
NAME REFERS TO A TENACIOUS PLANT 
THAT GROWS ON HILLS AND 
IT IS 
IMPOSSIBLE TO ERADICATE THEY ARE 
ALMOST ALWAYS 
ON STEEP LAND THAT 
NOBODY ELSE WANTS MANY 
LIVE IN 
TINY 
CORRUGATED IRON SHACKS 
IF IT 
WEREN'T FOR THE STIFLING HEAT YOU 
WOULD THINK YOU WERE BACK IN 
DICKEN'S LONDON HERE LIFE IS NASTY 
BRUTEISH AND SHORT 
THIS MAN HAS LIVED HERE ALL HIS 
LIFE HE'S DOING 
A COURSE 
ON THE 
OTHER RICH SIDE OF 
THE RIVER 
WHICH 
IN ECONOMIC 
TERMS MAY 
AS WELL 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD 
NEWSPAPERS SAY THE ECONOMY IS IMPROVING AND LIFE IS 
GETTING BETTER THAT IS NOT 
ACCURATE IN SAO PAULO 
THERE IS 
A 
HUGE CONTRAST BETWEEN RICH AND POOR 
THERE ARE ALWAYS LUXURY APARTMENTS 
BEING BUILT NEXT TO THE FAVELLA 
THE WORLD THINK IT IS GETTING 
BETTER BUT IT IS NOT BRAZIL'S BRAZIL'S CUMBERSOME TAX SYSTEM DOESN'T HELP 
THE POOR END UP PAYING 
PROPORTIONALLY FAR MORE IN THE 
TOPSY TURVY SYSTEM IF YOU EARN UP 
TO THREE TIMES THE MINIMUM WAGE YOU 
PAY FORTY EIGHT PER CENT 
TAX IF 
YOU EARN THIRTY TIMES 
THE MINIMUM WAGE YOU PAY TWENTY FOUR PER CENT THIS 
MAY BE 
ONE END 
OF THE 
INCOME AND 
WEALTH GAP AND 
DESIGNER SHOPS 
THE 
OTHER 
BUT DOES 
THE ECONOMIC 
GROWTH 
FEED THROUGH 
TO THE POPULATION AT 
LARGE WELL REAL G. D. P. PER HEAD HAS 
BEEN RISING LAST YEAR IT WAS STILL 
AN ADMITTEDLY LOW THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY BUT IT 
HAS ALMOST DOUBLED OVER THE PAST 
THREE YEARS 
I WORK IN THE INDUSTRY WHICH 
FOLLOWS THE 
MARKET 
OUR 
BUSINESS IS 
GROWING A 
LOT IN 
BRAZIL IT 
IN THAT 
RESPECT RESPECT 
OUR ECONOMY HERE IS PRETTY STABLE OUR COUNTRY IS 
STABLE TODAY WE KNOW THE STATE OF 
THE 
ECONOMY BUT 
TOMORROW WE CAN'T 
BE SURE 
THERE MAY STILL BE SOME UNCERTAINTY 
BUT IT IS ALL FAR CRY FROM THE 
DAYS OF HYPERINFLATION WHEN 
BRAZIL'S ECONOMY TEETERED ON 
INSTABILITY 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO INSTABILITY EXPLAIN TO 
ANYONE WHO 
HAS NOT HAD 
TO LIVE THROUGH THOSE L. RECALLED 
WHEN PEOPLE RECEIVED THEIR SALARIES 
EIGHTY PER CENT INFLATION PER MONTH PRICES AT 
THE SUPERMARKET WERE CHANGED DAY 
I REMEMBER 
GOING TO THE 
SUPERMARKET YOU 
HAD STACKS 
OF 
STICKERS ON THE 
GOODS AND 
WOULD TRY TO RUSH TO THE 
SUPERMARKET TO SPEND SOME OF YOUR 
MONEY BEFORE IT ROSE 
THERE WAS A JOKE ABOUT HOW SOME 
POINT IT WAS SKHEEPER TO GO ON THE 
TAXI THAN A BUS THE BUS YOU PAY 
UPFRONT IF 
THE RUN 
WAS LONG ENOUGH 
IT WOULD BE CHEAPER IT WAS 
IMPOSSIBLE TIMES PEOPLE 
COULD NOT 
SAVE MONEY 
NOW IT IS A DIFFERENT 
STORY AT LAST THE ECONOMIC 
STABILITY IS BEING CEMENTED 
INFLATION IS FORTY SEVEN PER CENT A YEAR NOT EIGHTY PER CENT A 
MONTH THE CURRENCY HAS GROWN ONE HUNDRED FORTY PER CENT 
SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO GROWTH IS FIFTY FOUR PER CENT AND 
UNEMPLOYMENT TEN PER CENT INTEREST RATES 
ARE STILL HIGH HAVING BEEN RAISED 
TO ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE IN MID APRIL BUT THERE IS 
A HUGE CHANGE GOING ON THE 
INTRODUCTION OF CREDIT UNTIL UNTIL RECENTLY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF PROPERTY WAS ALL 
CASH WHEN I BOUGHT MY HOUSE THREE 
YEARS AGO WHICH IS UNTHINKABLE FOR 
PEOPLE FROM THE U. K. I HAD TO PAY 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CASH 
HOW DO YOU AFFORD THAT 
A SMALLER HOUSE AND GO FROM A 
SMALLER TO SLIGHTLY BIGGER HOUSE 
ALL THE BUILDINGS THAT YOU SEE 
AROUND 
HERE IT IS 
ALL ONE HUNDRED PER CENT EQUITY 
WE ARE JUST STARTING NOW TO FINANCE 
REAL ESTATE THIS IS A 
SEA CHANGE 
AT LAST 
MORTGAGES ARE AVAILABLE AND 
THE MARKET IS BOOMING HOUSE PRICES 
AND OFFICE 
SPACE ARE INCREASING AT 
A SKY HIGH RATE RENTS FOR 
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IN 
SAO PAULO 
HAVE TRIPLED IN THE LAST THREE 
YEARS DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF 
PROPERTY FINANCE CREDIT IN SHOPS 
IS TAKING OFF THE INTEREST RATES 
ARE HORRENDOUS AND AN INTEREST 
RATE OF SEVENTY FOUR PER CENT IF YOU FANCY THIS SET 
MANY DON'T LOOK AT THE RATES AT ALL 
ONLY THE AVAILABILITY OF THE CREDIT 
THOSE WHO 
DO RUN 
THE NUMBER 
BUSINESS FIND 
THE HIGH INTEREST 
RATES HARD TO BEAR COUPLED WITH 
THE HUGELY INFLEXIBLE LABOUR LAWS 
AND THE 
COMPLEXITY OF THE TAX 
SYSTEM RUNNING A BUSINESS IS A 
BUREAUCRATIC NIGHTMARE 
WE PAY MORE 
THAN TWELVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TAXES 
THERE WAS A STUDY THE OTHER DAY 
THAT SHOWED 
BRAZIL WAS 
THE COUNTRY 
WHEN PEOPLE SPENT MOST OF TIME DEALING WITH 
THE COMPLEX 
TAX 
SYSTEM AND DEALING WITH ALL THE FACTORS IN 
INDUSTRY WHICH 
ACCOUNTS FOR 
JUST UNDER 
A 
THIRD OF 
THE ECONOMY 
IT IS 
THE STRENGTH OF THAT MAKES LIFE 
DIFFICULT FOR THE SECTORS THAT 
EXPORT THE SHOE INDUSTRY PRODUCES 
SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION PAIRS A YEAR MUCH IS 
SENT ABROAD THE RISING CURRENCY 
COUPLED WITH THE OTHER PROBLEMS 
MEANS MARKET SHARE IS 
BEING LOST 
CAN THE BRAZILIANS COMPETE ON 
PRICE 
I DON'T THINK SO OUR TARGET PRICE IS TO MAKE THINGS THAT THEY 
WOULDN'T DO FOR SMALLER ACCOUNTS 
FAST DELIVERIES SO THAT WOULD BE 
OUR TARGET BECAUSE IN PRICE WE 
CANNOT COMPETE WITH THEM 
WHAT WILL 
YOU DO WHEN THE CHINESE START 
TRYING TO TAKE THAT 
MARKET AS 
WELL 
THEN WE SEE WHEN IT HAPPENS YEAH 
SO IT'S FIGHT EVERY DAY KEEP US 
EFFICIENT 
AND YET THE CHINESE ALSO EFFICIENT BRING HUGE DEMAND FOR THE GOODS 
THAT BRAZIL PRODUCES ESPECIALLY 
THE FOOD AND IRON ORE OVERALL 
EXPERTS ARISE AT A HEALTHY RATE 
AND EVERY YEAR BRAZIL'S GROANING 
INFRASTRUCK STUER SEES MORE HEAVY 
LORRIES MAKING THEIR WAY TO THE 
PORTS SANTOS IS ONE OF THE BUSIEST 
PORTS IN THE WORLD WATCHING THE 
SHIPS 
COME AND 
GO GIVES 
A SENSE OF 
THE INDUSTRIAL MIGHT OF THIS 
ENORMOUS COUNTRY SIDE BY SIDE LIE 
THE NATURAL BEAUTY AND THE HEAVY 
INDUSTRY SIDE BY SIDE LIE THE OLD 
AND THE NEW SIDE BY SIDE LIE THE 
RICH AND THE POOR TO CALL IT LAND 
OF CONTRAST 
IS TOO MUCH OF A 
CLICHE BETTER 
TO DO 
AS 
THE LOCALS 
DO AND 
CALL IT
