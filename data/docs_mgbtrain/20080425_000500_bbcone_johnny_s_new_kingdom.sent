HE TELLS ME HE GOT BARN OWLS IN THIS BIG SHED ABOUT THIRTY F. T. UP 
I'M JOHNNY KINGDOM AND WHAT I LOVE DOING BEST IS FILMING WILDLIFE 
OH LOOK THAT'S A WONDERFUL SHOT 
LAST YEAR I BOUGHT MY OWN PIECE OF LAND JUST NEXT TO EXMOOR AND 
SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN BUSY BUILDING ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO HELP ME FILM THE WILDLIFE THAT LIVES HERE 
IT'S REALLY STARTING TO PAY OFF 
THIS LOOKS LIKE TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE A GREAT TIT 
AND MY NEW HIDE IS TURNING OUT TO BE A GREAT SPOT FOR FILMING ROE DEER 
BUT THIS WEEK I'LL BE AWAY FROM MY LAND BECAUSE I'M OFF TO SOMERSET TO TRY AND FILM ROE DEER CALVES 
THAT LITTLE HOLE THERE JUST LOOK DOWN IT 
OH I DON'T BELIEVE IT 
AND I'M GOING EVEN FURTHER AFIELD TO HAVE ANOTHER GO AT 
FILMING AN ANIMAL THAT SCARED THE LIFE OUT OF ME LAST YEAR 
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT I'M GONNA SIT THERE AND I'M GONNA SEE WILD BOAR THIS CLOSE 
THIS YEAR HAS BEEN THE HOTTEST SPRING THAT I'VE EVER KNOWN 
AND THAT HASN'T BEEN GOOD FOR THE WILDLIFE OR MY NEW LAND 
WE'VE HAD FIVE WEEKS OF DRY WEATHER 
EVERYBODY LIKES THE SUNSHINE BUT WE'VE HAD NO RAIN 
SO THE POND'S DRYING UP AND THE WATER IS DRAINING OUT OF MY POND 
I'VE BEEN WORRIED THAT NOT ONLY WILL THIS AFFECT THE ANIMALS BUT ALSO IT WILL RUIN A LOT OF MY HARD WORK 
BUT NOW IT'S MAY AND THE WEATHER HAS CHANGED 
WELL D'YOU KNOW I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY I FEEL 
THE RAIN HAVE COME AT LAST WE'VE HAD NO RAINS FOR WEEKS AND THE WATER IS VERY IMPORTANT 
MY POND WENT DOWN NEARLY TWO FOOT 
THAT'S WORRYING BECAUSE THE PIPE THERE FROM THE GROUND STOPPED RUNNING 
AND THE SPRING OVER THERE STOPPED THEY'RE BOTH RUNNING THIS MORNING I'M HAPPY 
DOWN THERE THERE WAS A LOT OF FROGSPAWN THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT TO ALL LIVE NOW 
THE BADGERS THEY GOT TO HAVE WORMS 
AND THE BIRDS THEY GOT TO HAVE WORMS TO FEED THEIR BABIES 
IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT 
SO THANK YOU LORD FOR ALL THAT RAIN WE'VE HAD THANK YOU 
RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO CHECK MY BIRD BOXES AT THE OLD HIDE 
LAST TIME I WAS DOWN THERE I COULD HEAR BIRDS BUILDING THEIR NEST 
SO I NOW HOPE WE'LL HAVE SOME CHICKS IN THERE 
RIGHT 
COR 
WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT THEY'VE HATCHED 
I CAN SEE SEVEN LITTLE CHICKS IN THERE 
SEVEN GREAT TITS 
THAT'S A WONDERFUL BROOD 
ALL GONE QUIET THE BEAKS IS GONE UP VERY SEALED TIGHT UNTIL THE PARENTS COME TO THAT ENTRANCE THAT 
LITTLE HOLE WHICH IS ABOUT THIS BIG THEY COME IN THEY DROP DOWN 
MUM'S IN THERE NOW OR DAD FEEDING 'EM 
OH THIS IS WONDERFUL SHOTS 
LOOK AT THAT I'VE GOT A GREAT TIT THERE WITH SEVEN CHICKS 
ALL TOGETHER 
THEY'RE NOT VERY BIG BUT THEY'VE GOT THEIR LITTLE FEATHERS ON LIKE THIS SEE JUST LIKE THIS 
YES SHE'S HERE AGAIN 
SHE'S STANDING ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE NEST FEEDING ONLY FEEDING TWO OR THREE TO A TIME 
YOU CAN'T EXACTLY SEE WHAT THEY'VE GOT IN THEIR BEAKS 
LITTLE TINY INSECTS CATERPILLARS SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO NOW I SHALL CHECK MY OTHER BOX 
BUT WHAT A LOVELY SIGHT IN THERE 
THESE HAVE HATCHED AS WELL OOH THEY'RE SMALL 
THEY'RE SMALLER THAN THE GREAT TIT 
D'YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THERE'S EIGHT THERE 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX 
THERE IS EIGHT LITTLE CHICKS IN THERE 
THERE'S EIGHT BLUE TITS 
AND SEVEN GREAT TITS 
YOU CAN'T EXPECT A BROOD LIKE THAT ALL TO LIVE 
WE HOPE AND PRAY THEY DO BUT YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP OUR BIRDS 
THE SCENE OUT THERE NOW WE'VE HAD A BIT OF RAIN AND THERE COULD BE CATERPILLARS AROUND 
AS LONG AS THERE'S FOOD OUT THERE IT'LL BE O. K. FOR THESE IN HERE THAT'S WHAT MAKES SENSE 
IT'S GREAT TO SEE SOME OF MY BIRD BOXES BEING USED AT LAST 
I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE CHICKS BECAUSE IF I CAN I'D LOVE TO SHOW YOU THEM LEAVING THE NEST 
ANOTHER ANIMAL I'VE BEEN KEEPING A CLOSE WATCH ON IS THE ROE DEER 
SINCE JANUARY I'VE SEEN LOTS ON MY LAND 
I'VE HAD SOME GREAT TIMES FILMING THEM FROM MY NEW HIDE 
WELL THE DEER IS DOWN THE VALLEY 
OH IT'S A WONDERFUL SIGHT JOHN 
LOOK AT THAT LOOK 
THERE'S TWO BUCKS LOOK 
SEE THEY PLAY 
LOOK AT HE'S TOSSING HIM ABOUT HE'S NOT HAVING IT THOUGH IS HE 
THERE'S A ROE DOE WITH HER BABY LOOK THERE YOU ARE LOOK 
THAT IS BEAUTIFUL THAT 
D'YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN FANTASTIC THE LAST FEW MONTHS 
I DIDN'T REALISE THAT I COULD GET SO CLOSE TO A ROE DEER ON MY LAND 
I CAN'T GET OVER THE LOVELY SHOTS I'VE GOT 
ROE BUCKS ROE DOES BUT WHAT I'D LOVE TO GET IS ROE KIDS THE SMALL BABY ONES 
AND IT'S A SHAME BUT NONE HAS BEEN BORN ON MY LAND 
I'VE GOT IN TOUCH WITH SOMEBODY AND I'M GOING TO THE SOMERSET LEVELS 
HOPEFULLY THERE TO FIND A NEWBORN CALF 
THE PERSON I'M MEETING IS MATTHEW PEASTER WHO I ALWAYS SEE AT COUNTRY SHOWS 
SO IT'S NOT JUST YOU JOHNNY WHO'S GOT THE BIG HAT I ALSO WEAR ONE 
MATTHEW LOVES PHOTOGRAPHING WILDLIFE ESPECIALLY THE ROE DEER 
YEAH WE'VE GOT THE FIELD HERE ON OUR LEFT NOW JOHNNY 
WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE LOOK SEE WHAT WE CAN SEE 
WHAT WE NEED TO DO FIRST IS FIND A FEMALE A ROE DOE 
BECAUSE SHE WILL BE CLOSE TO HER CALVES OR KIDS AS SOME PEOPLE CALL THEM 
WHEN SHE MOVES OFF WE CAN GO IN AND LOOK FOR HER BABY 
THERE'S ONE HERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF US WHERE STRAIGHT AHEAD 
STRAIGHT OUT THERE YOU CAN JUST SEE THE BACK OF HER 
THEY'VE JUST BEEN LOSING THEIR WINTER COATS SO THEY'VE LOOKED QUITE SHABBY FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS 
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WE'VE GOT 
THE GRASS IS SO TALL THAT EVEN THE DOE HER HEAD'S JUST POKING OUT THE TOP 
SO THE KIDS THEY WON'T BE EVEN AS TALL AS HER LEGS 
TRYING TO SPOT THE KIDS CAN BE QUITE DIFFICULT 
I THINK IF WE GO BACK THAT WAY RIGHT IF WE GO BACK THAT WAY AND STALK THAT HEDGE DOWN VERY GENTLE 
CAMERAMAN COME BEHIND ME SO FAR AND THEN I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE THE CAMERAMAN BACK A WEE BIT 
HE'LL HAVE TO HANG BACK A BIT YEAH BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH OF US 
WE GOT THE RIGHT GEAR BUT NOW WHICH IS WHERE THE SKILL COMES IN 
THE CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT YEAH YOU KNOW HOW TO STALK DO YOU 
OH I EXPECT SO MATE YES YOU DO AS WELL AS I DO SO 
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET OLDER 
IF YOU FIND 'EM IT'S A MIRACLE 
THIS IS A VERY DELICATE JOB 
ARE THERE ANY SIGNS AT ALL THERE 
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AT ALL ROUND HERE YOU KNOW 
IS IT THERE IS IT 
HOW MANY IS THERE THERE 
JUST ONE BUT THERE COULD BE ANOTHER ONE IN THE GRASS 
YOU GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHERE YOU STEP 
SHE'S JUST IN THE GRASS THERE SO YOU COME ROUND WITH ME HERE 
RIGHT NOW JUST VERY SLOWLY EDGE FORWARD HE'S IN THAT HOLE 
YOU CAN JUST VERY VERY SLOWLY JOHNNY 
JUST LOOK DOWN THERE VERY VERY DARK 
AIN'T THAT A WONDERFUL SIGHT 
HOW ABOUT THAT JOHNNY 
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
JUST LOOK AT THAT 
IT'S A WONDERFUL SIGHT 
CAN YOU HELP US A BIT BY JUST PULLING THE GRASS BACK A WEE BIT 
BECAUSE WE GOT TO DO VERY CAREFUL 
IT JUST WON'T MOVE 
IT'S THEIR REACTION NATURAL REACTION IS NOT TO MOVE 
IF WE TOUCH THE KID NOW THEN THE DOE WOULDN'T ACCEPT THAT KID AGAIN 
SO WE'VE JUST GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL JUST GETTING A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS 
YES I CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT 
TEN SECONDS YES 
HE'S ALL COVERED IN LINES NOT SPOTS LIKE THE RED DEER BUT IN LINES 
JUST SO SMALL 
IT'S LITERALLY DAYS OLD JOHNNY 
WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED THIS FOR THE WORLD THIS IS A WONDERFUL SIGHT 
NOW MATTHEW AND I ARE GOING TO CLEAR OUT TO MAKE SURE THE MOTHER COMES BACK TO HER BABY BEFORE WE LEAVE 
HERE SHE COMES LOVELY 
THIS MORNING I'M GOING TO SEE AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE REX BILTON 
LAST YEAR A HERD OF WILD BOAR ESCAPED ONTO HIS LAND 
AND ME AND THE WORLD'S PRESS WENT TO ASK REX WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE A COUPLE OF HOUNDS OUT AND SEE IF THEY CAN FLUSH THE BOAR OUT OF THE COVERS AROUND HERE 
AND TRY TO COAX 'EM BACK TOWARDS THEIR PEN WHICH IS UP HERE SOUTH WEST OF HERE ABOUT A MILE 
PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK THIS IS GONNA WORK 
AND REX WAS RIGHT 
A FEW MONTHS LATER I HAD A VERY SCARY TIME WITH ONE OF THEM 
OH THIS IS A WILD BOAR 
KEEP STILL 
OOH OH MY GOD HE'S GOING 
GOING LIKE A ROCKET IT'S A WILD BOAR LOOK AT HIM 
I WOULDN'T MIND TRYING TO GET SOME MORE SHOTS OF 'EM 
BUT THE PROBLEM IS I HAVEN'T SPOTTED ANY SINCE THEN 
I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF REX HAS SEEN ANY RECENTLY 
HELLO MATE LONG TIME NO SEE NICE TO SEE YOU 
BEFORE I START I'VE GOT TO ASK A QUESTION HOW'S DAD 
HE'S BETTER THANK YOU THAT'S GOOD NEWS 
LAST YEAR HE USED TO SEE THE WILD BOAR ALL THE TIME 
COURSE THIS IS A REAL HAVEN HERE FOR 'EM JOHNNY 
YOU KNOW I MEAN THERE'S LOADS OF HABITAT FOR 'EM ISN'T IT 
THEY SPREAD ALL THE WAY DOWN THIS VALLEY THEY SEEMED TO GO 
SOME WENT UP THE VALLEY AND SOME WENT DOWNWARDS AND THEY'VE MILLED AROUND HERE EVER SINCE REALLY 
A FEW MONTHS AGO IF YOU CAME HERE YOU'D SEE WHERE A BOAR HAD LIKE COME UP 
OUT OF THAT FIELD AND UP THROUGH THERE AND THEY'D LIKE DIG IN LIKE A ZIG ZAG PATH IN THROUGH THERE 
AND IT WAS JUST LIKE YOU PUT A SPADE DOWN AND CHURNED A CLAT THAT WAY AND A CLAT THAT WAY 
AND THEY'D GO UP THERE AND YOU COULD FOLLOW UN UP ROUND THE EDGE OF THE FIELD AND YOU KNOW 
DO A FAIR BIT OF CROP DAMAGE 
BUT YOU SEE REALLY MUCH AS I DON'T LIKE TO SEE THAT TYPE OF DAMAGE 
THESE WILD BOAR ARE TWO SOWS HAD MOVED IN THERE AND THEY'D BOTH HAD LITTERS 
AND THERE WAS NO I COULD HAVE SHOT THOSE SOWS TIME AND TIME AGAIN 
YOU NEVER HAD THE HEART BUT I COULDN'T SHOOT 'EM WITH LITTLE PIGLETS RUNNING AROUND 
WELL DONE I LIKE TO HEAR THAT I COULDN'T 
THEY'RE ALL THE WAY ROUND HERE THEN BUT THEY'RE SO SHY AREN'T THEY THEY ARE VERY SHY YOU WON'T 
YOU'D BE VERY VERY LUCKY TO SEE THEM IN THE DAY 
I THINK THEY'RE QUITE NOCTURNAL REALLY 
THEY USUALLY EARLY MORNING OR SORT OF EARLY EVENING OR WHEN IT'S PROPERLY DARK 
WELL THAT WAS INTERESTING BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME DOING TO FILM THEM AROUND HERE AGAIN 
BUT I'VE ALSO HEARD OF SOME WILD BOAR IN KENT

RIGHT NOW 
GET IT ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND I LOOK IN THE CAMERA LIKE THIS 
THREE PARTS GROWN THE BLUE TITS ARE 
QUITE A FEW IN THERE MIND 
GIVE THEM THREE OR FOUR MORE DAYS AND THEY'LL BE OFF 
BUT THEY'RE LOOKING GOOD 
HERE Y'RE HERE Y'RE EXCELLENT 
DEFINITELY FIVE THERE SO THAT'S NOT BAD OUT OF EIGHT I THINK IT WAS 
ANY CHICKS THAT DIE ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE NEST BY THE PARENTS TO KEEP IT CLEAN

LOVELY WEATHER THOUGH 
AND WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO 
WE'RE MEETING DEREK HARMAN A RETIRED GAMEKEEPER WHO'S BEEN FOLLOWING A FAMILY OF 
WILD BOAR SINCE THEY ESCAPED NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO 
FIRST OF ALL DEREK CAN YOU RUN ME THROUGH WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN THIS EVENING 
WELL HOPEFULLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS PUT SOME FOOD DOWN ON 
A SITE THAT I'VE BEEN FEEDING NOW FOR SEVERAL WEEKS 
AND YOU'RE GONNA SIT IN A HIDE SEAT AND FILM REAL WILD BOAR IN THE WILD 
IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND 
SO YOU'RE MORE OR LESS GUARANTEEING ME THAT I'M GOING TO SEE WILD BOAR TONIGHT 
IF YOU DON'T SEE WILD BOAR TONIGHT YOU'LL SEE WILD BOAR TOMORROW NIGHT 
WE'LL KEEP GOING UNTIL WE GET 'EM 
THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE FOR SUPPER TONIGHT WHAT A BAG LIKE THAT 
A BAGFUL LIKE THAT THEY GET THIS EVERY NIGHT

HOW DID YOU FIND OUT THIS THEN BY KEEP PUTTING THIS STUFF DOWN DID YOU 
I'VE BEEN FEEDING NOW I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE BOAR NOW FOR 
EIGHTEEN YEARS AND I'VE BEEN FEEDING THEM AND FILMING 'EM FOR TEN YEARS

HAVE YOU COME FACE TO FACE WITH ONE OUT THERE HAVE YOU BEEN 
THERE'S A COUPLE OF TIMES I'VE HAD TO GET OUT THE WAY A BIT SHARPISH 
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T TAKE MY OWN ADVICE 
I ADVISE PEOPLE WHEN THEY ACTUALLY SEE A WILD BOAR TO BACK OFF 
NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN OR NINETY NINE TIMES OUT OF ONE HUNDRED HE'S GOING TO BACK OFF FIRST 
BECAUSE HE'S GONNA KNOW YOU'RE THERE LONG BEFORE YOU KNOW HE'S THERE 
LAST YEAR I COME FRONT ON ONE 
I TELL YOU ONE THING HA HA HA I NEARLY MESSED ME PANTS 
I HOPE THINGS TURN OUT FOR US TONIGHT AND WE CAN GET 'EM ON FILM AND YOU'LL 
SEE WHAT I MEAN AND THEN YOU'LL FALL IN LOVE WITH 'EM LIKE I HAVE
