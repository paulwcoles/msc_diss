PREVIOUSLY ON THE APPRENTICE 
THIS TASK IS ALL ABOUT PORTRAITS YOU'RE GOING TO PHOTOGRAPH CUSTOMERS AND SELL THEM THEIR PORTRAITS 
THE CHALLENGE START A PHOTO BUSINESS IN EUROPE'S BIGGEST SHOPPING CENTRE 
LET THE CAMERA CREATE THE ILLUSION THAT YOU'RE WEARING SOMETHING REALLY NICE 
SIMON'S GLAMOUR THEME FAILED TO HIT THE MARK 
GET YOURSELF ON MY SETTEE RIGHT NOW 
FOR HELENE'S TEAM THEIR LOOKALIKE SCORED 
DID YOU KNOW HE WAS GONNA BE HERE TODAY 
BUT LUCINDA COULDN'T GET THE PHOTOS OUT OF THE COMPUTER 
NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY I'M NOT A TECHNICAL PERSON 
IT'S ABOUT TEAMWORK ABOUT BEING ASSIGNED A ROLE AND GETTING ON WITH IT 
YOU PUT PEOPLE IN THE APPROPRIATE SKILL SET FOR CHRIST'S SAKE 
WHILE SIMON'S TEAM WAS ALL NEGATIVES 
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME HOW TO MANAGE 
I'M IN CHARGE IT'S MY NECK ON THE LINE THIS TIME 
IN THE BOARDROOM HELENE SWEPT TO VICTORY 
A RUNAWAY SUCCESS WELL DONE THEN CLAIRE WENT FOR SIMON

AND SIR ALAN WENT FOR CLAIRE 
YOU ARE SHOWING NO RESPECT WHATSOEVER TO THIS MAN GET BACK TO THE HOUSE YOU'RE THE NEXT TEAM LEADER 
I'M SICK OF IT LOOKING AT YOU AT THE MOMENT GET OUT THAT DOOR 
SIMON BECAME THE FOURTH CASUALTY OF THE BOARDROOM 
I'M SORRY MY FRIEND I THINK YOU'RE A BIT OUT OF YOUR DEPTH HERE 
YOU'RE FIRED THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY 
NOW TWELVE REMAIN TO FIGHT FOR THE CHANCE TO BECOME THE APPRENTICE 
SEVEN THIRTY A M. 
I'D RATHER NOT BE MANAGER AND LET SOMEBODY ELSE HAVE A GO BUT 
IT'S CRAZY ISN'T IT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ONE 
AND FIVE PEOPLE STILL HAVEN'T 
MAYBE I JUST SHOULD HAVE LEARNT TO KEEP MY GOB SHUT FROM DAY ONE 
SHIT 
GOOD MORNING SIR ALAN GOOD MORNING CLAIRE I WISH I WAS MORE APPROPRIATELY DRESSED 
COULD YOU GET ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE UP YEAH 
AND I'LL HAVE A QUICK CHAT WITH YOU O. K. 
SIR ALAN'S HERE SO CAN YOU JUST PUT SOME P. J. S. ON OR SOMETHING AND MEET IN THE LOUNGE 
ARE YOU SERIOUS YEAH OBVIOUSLY HE DOESN'T LIKE TO BE KEPT WAITING 
GOOD MORNING EVERYONE GOOD MORNING SIR ALAN 
I'M GONNA BALANCE THE TEAMS UP A LITTLE BIT 
KEVIN I'D LIKE YOU TO STEP OVER HERE AND JOIN RENAISSANCE 
CLAIRE I'M NOT GONNA GO OVER AGAIN WHAT WE DISCUSSED THE OTHER DAY BUT I WANT YOU TO BE THE TEAM LEADER 
ALPHA YOUR TEAM LEADER'S GONNA BE LUCINDA 
I'VE LISTENED TO YOU OVER THE PAST WEEKS YOU DON'T LIKE TECHNOLOGY 
YOU DON'T THINK YOU'RE VERY GOOD ON SALES 
I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU ARE GOOD AT NOW I'VE SELECTED TWO FARMS YOU'RE GOING 
TO VISIT TODAY AND THOSE FARMS SPECIALISE IN MAKING ICE CREAM 
BUT THEY DON'T SELL IN THE LONDON AREA YET 
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IS DEVELOP SEVERAL FLAVOURS OF ICE CREAM TO EXPAND THEIR BUSINESS INTO LONDON 
YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT AND SELL THOSE FLAVOURS TO THE TRADE 
THE TEAM THAT COMES BACK WITH THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF 
ORDERS IN SALES VOLUME WILL WIN AND THE TEAM THAT DOESN'T WILL LOSE 
AND IN THAT TEAM ONE OF YOU WILL GET FIRED O. K. OFF YOU GO 
THE TEAMS GET STRAIGHT DOWN TO BRAINSTORMING IDEAS FOR THEIR ICE CREAM FLAVOURS 
CAN I JUST SAY BEFORE WE KICK OFF THAT OBVIOUSLY 
I KNOW THAT I'M PROJECT MANAGER FOR A SECOND TIME AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS TASK AND WORKING WITH 
YOU ALL BUT I'M CONSCIOUS THAT I AM VERY DIRECT AND I CAN OVERPOWER PEOPLE SO PLEASE 
IF I DO THAT CAN YOU JUST TELL ME STRAIGHTAWAY SO I STOP DOING IT 
THANK YOU 
RIGHT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE AN IDEA OF WHICH FLAVOURS WE'LL CREATE WE NEED TO HAVE A MINIMUM OF THREE 
MY IDEA IS TO GO FOR DIFFERENT COCKTAILS AS THE FLAVOURS PINA COLADA 
VODKA AND COKE OR TEQUILA SUNRISE 
I'M JUST NOT SURE THAT I COULD SEE A FAMILY GOING INTO A CINEMA AND FOR 
THEIR CHILDREN WANTING TO PURCHASE A SEX ON THE BEACH ICE CREAM 
HEADING UP THE OTHER TEAM BUSINESS ANALYST AND PART TIME AROMATHERAPIST LUCINDA 
ARE WE READY TO MOVE ON YEAH 
O. K. JUST IN YOUR OWN TIME YEAH 
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU NEED TO BE A BITCH IN BUSINESS TO SUCCEED 
PROJECT MANAGERS ARE THERE TO FACILITATE TEAMS NOT NECESSARILY DICTATE 
WORKING TOGETHER AND HAVING FUN THAT BRINGS OUTSTANDING RESULTS 
SO FAR I'VE GOT CARROT NUTS GINSENG AND GINGER 
GINSENG'S AN APHRODISIAC YOU 
GOJI BERRIES WHEATGRASS WHAT ABOUT LIKE A NORMAL CUP OF TEA 
YOU GET COFFEE ICE CREAM YOU CAN GET TEA ICE CREAM 
IT'S THE NATION'S DRINK ISN'T IT 
GOOSEBERRY FOOL EVERYBODY THINKS LUCINDA'S 
A BIT ECCENTRIC A BIT OF A FRUIT CAKE 
AND THE REALITY OF IT IS 
WE'VE SEEN FOUR TASKS NOW WHERE SHE HAS BEEN SO LAZY SHE CAN'T BE SELECTIVELY 
IF I'M NOT IN CHARGE I'M GONNA SIT HERE AND HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE AND NOT DO FUCK ALL FOR ANYBODY ELSE 
SO WE'LL SEE LET'S GO 
TOMORROW THE TEAMS MUST GET BARS AND RESTAURANTS IN LONDON TO BUY THEIR ICE CREAM 
TODAY THEY'RE OFF TO THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THE TWO DAIRY FARMS THEY WILL REPRESENT 
IT'S LOVELY ROUND HERE I HAVEN'T SEEN GREEN FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS

LOCAL TASTING TO HELP DECIDE ON THE FLAVOURS THEY'LL LAUNCH IN LONDON

WE'VE BEEN AS QUICK AS WE CAN

NO ONE HERE 
IS THIS THE PLACE 
WITH NO ONE TO TASTE THEIR ICE CREAM MICHAEL TRIES THE LOCAL PUB 
HI GUYS SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU WE ARE SAMPLING THREE NEW ICE CREAMS 
WE REALLY NEED SOME PEOPLE WITH DISCERNING PALATES WHO KNOW ABOUT FOOD TO TASTE THE ICE CREAMS 
DO YOU THINK WE HAVE DISCERNING OPINIONS AFTER A COUPLE OF BOTTLES OF WINE 
IF YOU'VE GOT A GOOD PALATE YOU'VE GOT A GOOD PALATE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOU DRINK 
I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY WE'RE REALLY BUSY 
I THINK WE PROBABLY COULD YEAH 
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT'S IN IT AT THE MOMENT 
I WANT YOU TO TRY AND DISCERN THE FLAVOURS 
AN INTERESTING EXPRESSION YOU'VE GOT ON YOUR FACE SIR 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THERE'S A REAL LOCAL THEME 
ARE YOU LIKING IT ABSOLUTELY 
THAT'S ACTUALLY CIDER AND ELDERFLOWER 
ELDERFLOWER I CAN TASTE IT THROUGH MY NOSE 
DO YOU THINK YOUR WIVES WOULD HAVE THE SAME IDEA OR DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD LIKE DIFFERENT ONES 
I DON'T HAVE A WIFE BUT I THINK MY SISTER IN LAW WOULD DEFINITELY 
GO FOR THOSE ICE CREAMS FOR THE KIDS DEFINITELY BRILLIANT 
I THINK MY EX WIFE OH SORRY SIR

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING I APPRECIATE IT 
LONDON ELEVEN FORTY FIVE P. M. LUCINDA AND HER TEAM ARE BACK AT THE HOUSE 
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH INDEED WE GOT OUR FLAVOURS OUT FINALLY

I WAS GOING TO PUT LINDI YOU WITH LEE AND HELENE 
YOU LEAD THAT TEAM BECAUSE YOU'VE MADE THE APPOINTMENTS AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR MARKET 
I WAS GOING TO GO WITH RAEF AND JEN SO WE MIX UP THE EXPERTISE 
THAT WENT DOWN LIKE A LEAD BALLOON 
NOBODY LIKED IT NO ONE LIKES IT 
THAT'S FINE GREAT WE'RE ALL TIRED 
LET'S GO TO BED 
TODAY THE TEAMS MUST GET RESTAURANTS BARS AND RETAIL OUTLETS IN LONDON TO BUY THEIR ICE CREAMS 
WE'VE GOT SPOONS WE'VE GOT ICE CREAM WE'VE GOT THE APPOINTMENTS 
WE'VE GOT A GREAT ATTITUDE COME ON LET'S GO AND DO IT 
WITH SIX APPOINTMENTS BOOKED LUCINDA AND HER TEAM HEAD OFF 
SECOND IN COMMAND LINDI HAS HELD ON TO HER SALES FORCE OF JENNIFER AND RAEF 
AS A GROUP WE'VE WORKED SO WELL TOGETHER WE'VE BUILT UP A RAPPORT 
WE'VE GOT APPOINTMENTS AND I THINK IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO RUIN THAT BY CHANGING THE DYNAMICS OF THIS GROUP 
THE REASON I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE HER ALL OUR APPOINTMENTS WAS BECAUSE 
WE WORKED VERY HARD TO GET THESE APPOINTMENTS YESTERDAY 
YEAH 
AT THE HOUSE CLAIRE HAS KEPT HER TEAM BACK FOR A STRATEGY MEETING 
O. K. SOUTH LONDON IN CLAPHAM YOU'VE GOT CLAPHAM PICTURE HOUSE WHICH IS AN INDEPENDENT CINEMA 
WE NEED TO TARGET THEM BUT WE COULDN'T GET THROUGH ON THE PHONE YESTERDAY 
HOW MANY ABSOLUTE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CONCRETE APPOINTMENTS DO WE HAVE TODAY 
WE'VE GOT TWO ONE AT THREE O'CLOCK AND ONE AT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
MY DUTY WASN'T TO BE MAKING CALLS IT WAS TO MAKE THE ICE CREAM WHICH GOT DONE UNDER INTENSIVE PRESSURE 
I JUST THINK THREE PEOPLE CALLING NON STOP ALL DAY COULD GENERATE MORE THAN TWO APPOINTMENTS 
IT'S TERRIBLE 
YOU'D GET FIRED ALONE IN A TELESALES COMPANY FOR THAT 
YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE SEEING YEAH MR. CORFIELD 
AT AN UPMARKET GROCERS ON THE KING'S ROAD 
LINDI AND HER SALES TEAM MAKE THEIR FIRST PITCH 
SO THIS ONE IS CALLED AVOCADOLICIOUS 
IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE 
I'M CONFIDENT THAT YOU WILL WANT TO PLACE AN ORDER STRAIGHTAWAY 
PROJECT MANAGER LUCINDA HEADS FOR AN APPOINTMENT MADE YESTERDAY BY HER SALES TEAM 
HIYA AT AN ICE CREAM PARLOUR 
I'M WORKING ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY CALLED DOWNSVIEW FARM 
WE RECENTLY WENT INTO PRODUCTION FOR MAKING BEAUTIFUL ICE CREAMS 
THAT WE'D LIKE YOU TO TRY AND GIVE US YOUR FEEDBACK AND HOPEFULLY SEE IF YOU'D LIKE TO BUY 
THE FACT IS WE MAKE OUR OWN ICE CREAM 
AND I'M HAPPY MAKING IT MYSELF 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
HE TOLD THEM HE HAD NO NEED FOR ICE CREAM AND THEY MADE THEIR OWN 
BIT OF A FUCK UP HUGE FUCK UP BUT LET'S TAKE IT FORWARD 
IT'S NOT ABOUT GETTING THE APPOINTMENT IT'S ABOUT GETTING AN APPOINTMENT THAT'S WORTH IT 
THE OTHER GUYS ARE CALLING 
HI GUYS HI LINDI HOW ARE YOU DOING 
WE'VE GOT OUR FIRST ORDER FOR 
FIFTEEN LITRES 
WOO HOO 
BRILLIANT THAT'S BRILLIANT ABOUT YOUR FIRST ORDER BUT A COUPLE OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO CHECK WITH YOU 
SOME OF OUR APPOINTMENTS HAVE HAD NO NEED FOR ICE CREAM 
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ICE CREAM MAKER 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT LUCINDA CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING SERIOUS YES 
EVEN IF THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN ICE CREAM MAKER WE CAN 
STILL SELL TO THEM OF COURSE YOU'RE THE SALES TEAM YOU KNOW 
BUT IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT 
WE NEED TO KNOW THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST O. K. 
SEE YOU THANKS BYE 
ARE YOU WORRIED NO I JUST FIND IT ANNOYING WHEN PEOPLE TELL YOU HOW TO DO THINGS YOU KNOW HOW TO DO 
TEN FIFTEEN A M. 
WITH JUST TWO APPOINTMENTS BOOKED CLAIRE'S TEAM IS FORCED TO HAWK ITS ICE CREAM DOOR TO DOOR 
I LITERALLY WANT A FEW MOMENTS OF YOUR TIME BECAUSE WE'RE SUPPLYING SOME QUITE INNOVATIVE ICE CREAM 
DO YOU HAVE A FEW MOMENTS TO TALK ABOUT THIS YES SURE 
THIS IS THE VERY BERRY ICE CREAM WHICH IS EXTREMELY POPULAR 
THIS PARTICULAR ICE CREAM ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO YOUR FIVE A DAY PORTIONS OF FRUIT 
SO FOR ANY OF YOUR DISCERNING CUSTOMERS THIS IS THE ONE 
INSTRUCTED BY CLAIRE TO TARGET AN INDEPENDENT CINEMA IN CLAPHAM ALEX KEVIN AND SARA MEET THE MANAGER 
WE'VE GOT SOME SAMPLES WITH US 
RIGHT O. K. ONE IS CALLED VERY BERRY 
SECONDARY TO THAT WE'VE GOT SCRUMPALICIOUS WHICH IS CIDER AND ELDERBERRY 
WITH THE NEW CIDER MARKET OPENING UP IT'S QUITE SEXY QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO DRINK CIDER 
IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE NEW CHAMPAGNE 
THAT'S DIFFERENT ISN'T IT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT 
I LIKE THEM I THINK THEY'RE GOOD BUT WE DON'T JUST OWN CLAPHAM WE OWN EIGHTEEN CINEMAS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
AND ALL THE SELLING AND BUYING PRODUCTS WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE HEAD OFFICE 
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IF YOU COULD COME BACK AND WE CAN ARRANGE FOR MY GUY 
TO COME DOWN AS WELL THEN IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY EXPAND YOUR SALES 
IT'S BEEN INTERESTING 
BYE BYE I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT HI ALEX 
I'VE GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU I'VE JUST BEEN INTO CLAPHAM PICTURE HOUSE 
M. M. M. I'VE SPOKEN TO THE GUY AND WE HAVE EIGHTEEN CINEMAS 
OH MY GOD AND WE'VE GOT ANOTHER MEETING WITH 
HIM BACK AT THREE O'CLOCK AND POTENTIALLY GONNA SECURE A MASSIVE DEAL 
WHOO 
SO HE'S PRETTY MUCH DEFINITELY I FEEL GONNA PURCHASE 
OH BRILLIANT 
THAT'S BRILLIANT WELL DONE TO YOU GUYS IT'S SMASHING 
WE'RE GONNA ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT BYE 
BUT IN NOTTING HILL LINDI RAEF AND JENNIFER ARRIVE AT ANOTHER CINEMA IN THE SAME CHAIN 
YESTERDAY THEY FIXED AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE CINEMA MANAGER AND HEAD BUYER FOR THE GROUP 
THE REASON WHY WE GAVE YOU GUYS A CALL IS BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF BUSINESS THAT YOU RUN 
ERM IT FITS IN COMPLETELY WITH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO 
YOU KNOW WE WANT TO GO FOR SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT WHICH I THINK IS WHAT YOU GUYS ARE ALL ABOUT 
IT'S INTERESTING 
YOU CAN DEFINITELY TASTE THE AVOCADO YOU CAN DEFINITELY TASTE THE AVOCADO 
YEAH I THINK I KIND OF LIKE IT 
IF YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE IT AN ORDER TODAY WHICH I HOPE YOU WILL 
AND I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT YOU WILL YOU WILL HAVE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS IN YOUR CINEMAS TO HAVE THIS ICE CREAM 
EFFECTIVELY YOU WILL BE THE ONLY CINEMA TO HAVE 
THESE TYPE OF FLAVOURS WHICH WILL BE A HUGE SELLING POINT FOR YOURSELVES 
BASED ON TASTE AND WHERE IT COMES FROM THE KIND OF ETHICS BEHIND 
THE PRODUCT YES IT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD TRY 
IN CENTRAL LONDON WE WOULD DO ONE HUNDRED LITRES ACROSS THE TWO PRODUCTS 
WHAT I WILL DO IS I WILL GIVE YOU A BREAKDOWN OF WHERE I WANT THAT STOCK TO GO TO BRIXTON TO CLAPHAM 
TO STRATFORD EAST GREENWICH AND TO THE GATE GREAT DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU 
THANKS VERY MUCH 
GOOD NEWS FOR LUCINDA'S TEAM IS BAD NEWS FOR ALEX 
ALEX WOTHERSPOON 
ALEX HI IT'S ALISTAIR FROM CITY SCREEN HI THERE 
WE'VE JUST TODAY PLACED A LARGE ORDER WITH A COMPANY CALLED ALPHA FOR A LARGE AMOUNT OF ICE CREAM 
WHAT AT THE PICTURE HOUSE YES WE HAVE 
RIGHT O. K. THANKS VERY MUCH 
SHALL WE GO BACK IN THERE AND DISCUSS THIS WHAT IS GOING ON 
I'M GONNA GO BACK IN AND SPEAK TO HIM 
AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON 
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
I'VE JUST GOT A CALL FROM SOMEONE CALLED ALISTAIR PRESUMABLY FROM YOUR HEAD OFFICE 
ALISTAIR FROM HEAD OFFICE YEAH 
THEY'VE SPOKEN TO A COMPANY CALLED ALPHA 
RIGHT RIGHT 
AT THE SAME TIME WE WERE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH ANOTHER SUPPLIER OF ICE CREAM SO WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY 
ABLE TO TAKE AN ORDER FROM YOU GUYS TODAY RIGHT ALL RIGHT 
ALL RIGHT YEAH THANKS VERY MUCH 
THANKS A LOT 
IT'S GAME OVER 
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT 
JUST ANNOYING HOW HE WAS MAKING OUT HE WAS THE BIG CHEESE 
HI KEVIN 
HI CLAIRE WE'VE JUST HAD A CALL FROM THE PICTURE HOUSE TO SAY THE WHOLE CHAIN WHICH IS 
EIGHTEEN CINEMAS HAVE TAKEN UP AN ORDER FOR ALPHA BECAUSE THEY'VE GONE DIRECTLY TO THE HEAD OFFICE 
RIGHT O. K. 
WHAT A SHAME THAT'S REALLY BAD NEWS FOR US 
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOW 
IT'S ONE FORTY FIVE P. M. AND WE'VE GOT FIVE AND A QUARTER HOURS TO KEEP ON SELLING 
ALL RIGHT SEE YOU SOON BYE 
TWO THIRTY P. M. 
FOUR AND A HALF HOURS TO GO 
THERE'S A RESTAURANT THERE THE ORIENTAL IT'S CLOSED 
CLAIRE'S DOOR TO DOOR STRATEGY HAS SHIFTED JUST THIRTY LITRES 
I'VE GOT A FREEZER BUT I DON'T REALLY SELL ICE CREAM IN THIS PLACE 
I'M REALLY WORRIED YEAH I AM REALLY WORRIED 
IT'S INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING GOING DOOR TO DOOR WITH EVERYBODY 
BECAUSE IT'S VERY TIME CONSUMING WE'RE IN A CATCH TWENTY TWO 
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP ON BEING POSITIVE 
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP ON GETTING THE SALES IN AND NOT LET IT AFFECT OUR MOMENTUM 
IF YOU CAN'T GO FOR TWENTY FIVE GO FOR TWENTY OF THE VERY BERRY 
GO TWENTY AND YOU HAVE MY WORD YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT PROFIT MARGIN NERO 
THEY SELL THEMSELVES AS SOON AS SOMEONE TASTES THEM 
CAN WE SHAKE YOUR HAND ON THAT YEAH NERO 
I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT THE SINGLE DEALS IT'S ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE GETTING THE BIG DEALS 
WE'VE GOT A MASSIVELY HIGH END PRODUCT WALKING AROUND THE STREETS GOING INTO RESTAURANTS AND LITTLE 
SHOPS TRYING TO SELL IT BY THE FIVE LITRE TUB AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT SHOULD BE 
IF YOU FAIL TO PREPARE THEN YOU PREPARE TO FAIL AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S DONE 
SHE'S NOT PREPARED ANY PRE QUALIFIED LEADS AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO FAIL AS A TEAM 
IT'S NOT GOOD 
FOUR P. M. 
WE'RE BEING VERY CAREFUL WHERE WE'RE TAKING IT BECAUSE IT'S A SPECIALIST BESPOKE ICE CREAM 
THE LAST OF CLAIRE'S PRE BOOKED APPOINTMENTS 
I WOULD PERSONALLY ONLY ORDER ENOUGH TO FILL OUR FRIDGE THIS ONCE AND SEE 
HOW IT GOES SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES TO SHIFT 
THIS SHOP IS THE PERFECT SHOP FOR THIS SORT OF PRODUCT 
IT WASN'T A BIG ORDER BUT IF THEY HAD ONE OF THESE ORDERS EVERY HOUR 
BECAUSE THEY HAD PLANNED PROPERLY AND STRUCTURED IT 
AND TARGETED THEIR MARKET THEY WOULD BE DOING WELL 
AT THE MOMENT I'M CONCERNED FOR THEM TO BE QUITE HONEST 
I THINK THEY'RE IN TROUBLE 
FOLLOWING HER SALES TEAM'S BAD LEAD AT THE ICE CREAM PARLOUR 
LUCINDA HAS FOCUSED ON SELLING TO SPECIALISED OUTLETS 
THIS ONE IS THE AVOCADO AND CHILLI AND CAN BE USED AS A 
STARTER ON A BED OF ROCKET LEAVES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR AS A DESSERT 
ACTUALLY I WAS JUST GOING TO CHANGE MY MENU IN TWO WEEKS' TIME 
THAT'S PERFECT WE CAN GET IT TO YOU WITHIN TWO WEEKS YEAH 
FANTASTIC WELL I'M GLAD WE POPPED IN 
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT 
I WASN'T CONFIDENT WITH LUCINDA BEFORE SHE TOOK THE TASK ON 
BUT SHE DID ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT LUCINDA HAS BEEN BRILLIANT 
COOL CALM AND COLLECTED WHEN OTHERS MIGHT HAVE PANICKED 
ANYTHING WE CAN GET ANYTHING LUCINDA'S CLEARLY A MANAGER THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES 
LUCINDA'S SECOND IN COMMAND LINDI IS IN WEST LONDON FOR NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH THE CHIEF BUYER FOR A CHAIN OF GASTROPUBS 
I'M INTERESTED IN BOTH FLAVOURS BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE UNIQUE 
WE'D LIKE TO GO OUT ON A LIMB AND TRY SOMETHING NEW AND WE'RE PREPARED TO HAVE A GO AT THAT 
IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO AGREE THAT IT 
WON'T GO INTO ANY OTHER PUBS FOR AT LEAST THREE MONTHS 
YEAH WE CAN PUT THAT AS A CONDITION ON THE ORDER THAT WE'LL GUARANTEE YOU EXCLUSIVITY FOR THREE MONTHS 
O. K. MOST DEFINITELY WE COULD PROBABLY ORDER 
BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE HUNDRED FORTY LITRES AS A ONE OFF TRIAL 
THE FIRST PUB IN LONDON TO HAVE AVOCADO ICE CREAM HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
THREE MONTHS' EXCLUSIVITY 
OH THAT WAS NICE AND EASY 
IT'S AN ORDER FOR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY LITRES 
WE'VE JUST SOLD FIVE HUNDRED FORTY COME ON 
DID WE BLOW YOUR TARGET OUT THE WATER MATE OR WHAT 
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT TARGETS ARE THERE TO BE BROKEN 
AND WE'RE SMASHING THEM TARGETS WE ARE SIZZLING HOT 
I'M JUST OVERWHELMED BY HOW GOOD WE ARE 
WE'VE STROLLED AROUND SWANNING FROM ONE APPOINTMENT TO THE NEXT 
NOT EVEN A S. W. A BEAD OF SWEAT 
WE'RE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER 
SIX POINT THREE OH 
ALEX KEVIN AND SARA WRAP UP ANOTHER DEAL WITH A SMALL RETAILER 
THANK YOU BYE I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE DID A FANTASTIC JOB 
I'M NOT CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN BEAT A NATIONAL CINEMA CHAIN WITH A SMALL SHOP I'M NOT CONFIDENT AS A TEAM 
TWENTY MINUTES TO GO 
THIS WILL HAVE TO BE HARD STRAIGHT TO THE POINT NO FLUFFING AROUND GUYS 
PROJECT MANAGER CLAIRE HAS FIXED ONE FINAL MEETING LET'S DO IT 
AT A TRENDY BAR AND GRILL 
SO THIS IS OUR FIRST SAMPLE 
IT'S CALLED SCRUMPALICIOUS H. M. M. IT'S PRETTY GOOD 
IT'S A CONCOCTION OF CIDER AND ELDERFLOWER 
WE THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE NOVEL VERY UNUSUAL FOR ICE CREAM 
WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SUPPLY THIS PRODUCT TO YOUR RESTAURANT AND 
WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER 
FROM WHAT WE'VE TASTED I THINK THE QUALITY'S DEFINITELY THERE 
WE CURRENTLY MAKE ALL OUR OWN PRODUCTS 
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IN HOUSE 
THE INITIAL PRICE YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS A BIT TOO HIGH 
O. K. IF WE DID AN ORDER TODAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO OFFER YOU A 
DISCOUNT IF WE CAN GET IT SIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED THIS EVENING 
O. K. YEAH THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU 
THANK YOU ALL RIGHT 
THANK YOU 
AT TWO HUNDRED LITRES IT'S THEIR BIGGEST DEAL OF THE DAY 
WHEN I PUT IT IN THE CALCULATOR I THOUGHT FUCK 
I WAS LIKE THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT 
DID IT AGAIN I WAS LIKE EIGHT HUNDRED 
THAT IS THE SIGN OF A GOOD SALESPERSON 
WE KEPT UP THE MOMENTUM 
YEP 
AGAINST ALL ODDS 
BOTH TEAMS ARE BACK AT THE HOUSE 
THE FUCKING SHIT I'VE BEEN PULLING OUT OF THE BAG TODAY LET ME TELL YOU TELL YOU WHAT 
WE ARE NOT ONLY GOING TO KICK YOUR ARSE WE ARE GOING TO MAKE HISTORY 
WHAT'S LUCINDA LIKE AS A TEAM MANAGER 
LUCINDA'S LUCINDA WHETHER SHE WAS THERE OR NOT 
WE STILL WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT WE HAD TO DO 
THE RESULTS THAT OUR SUB TEAM ACHIEVED WERE PHENOMENAL 
THEY WERE JUST INCREDIBLE AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED REGARDLESS OF WHO WAS TEAM MANAGER 
WELL I WAS SECOND IN COMMAND 
YES YOU WERE AND A VERY GOOD SECOND IN COMMAND 
TODAY IT'S THE BOARDROOM 
THE CANDIDATES ARE PACKED AND HEADING FOR THEIR APPOINTMENT WITH SIR ALAN 
I FELT MORE OF A PROJECT MANAGER THAN LUCINDA 
IT WAS DEFINITELY MY TEAM ME JEN AND RAEF 
WE DID INCREDIBLY WELL AND EVERYONE WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD 
PEOPLE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND THEY WERE COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT THEY WERE DOING 
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SEE THAT OR REALISE THAT 
IT IS THE MOST PRESSURE I'VE BEEN UNDER IN A WORK SITUATION 
DURING THE LAST BOARDROOM SIR ALAN SCREAMED AT ME SO MUCH I KNEW THAT I HAD TO DELIVER ON THIS TASK 
I REALLY FEEL THE GUILLOTINE INCHES AWAY FROM MY NECK 
YOU CAN GO THROUGH TO THE BOARDROOM NOW 
GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON SIR ALAN 
SO IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT TASK THIS ONE IN THE SENSE THAT 
YOU WERE OUT GETTING NEW CUSTOMERS IN NEW TERRITORIES FOR THESE NEW BUSINESSES 
THIS WAS NO JOKE THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY DELIVER THE STUFF THAT YOU INNOVATED 
NOW RENAISSANCE BEARING IN MIND THAT SHE WAS UNDER A SEVERE WARNING HERE HOW WAS YOUR TEAM LEADER 
I THOUGHT SHE DID EXCEEDINGLY WELL 
I SAW A NUMBER OF CHANGES IN CLAIRE IN HER APPROACH TO HER TEAM 
SHE BECAME EXTREMELY RECEPTIVE TO EVERYONE ELSE'S OPINIONS WHICH I THOUGHT WAS COMMENDABLE 
YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB ON THEM 
WHAT WERE YOUR ICE CREAMS LIKE THE FIRST ONE WAS VERY BERRY 
WHICH HAD FIVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BERRIES IN IT 
WE WERE GOING FOR THE HEALTHY OPTION 
WHAT COULD BE HEALTHY ABOUT ICE CREAM IT'S GOT BERRIES IN IT WHICH ARE HIGH IN ANTIOXIDANTS 
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE FAT A BIT OF A HARD SELL THAT IS HEALTHY ICE CREAM IT WORKED 
WHAT'S EVEN HARDER IS THAT THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT PERHAPS THEY COULD PERSUADE MOTHERS TO GIVE CHILDREN 
FIVE OF THOSE ICE CREAMS A DAY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS FIVE HELPINGS OF FRUIT A DAY ARE HEALTHY 
WE CAPITALISED ON BEING IN THE COUNTRY AND DID A CIDER 
AND ELDERFLOWER WHICH WE CALL SCRUMPALICIOUS 
YOU KNOW I ASKED YOU TO GO AND HAVE SOME MARKET RESEARCH AND GO AND GET IT TESTED ON PEOPLE 
WHAT HAPPENED THERE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AT THE VILLAGE HALL WERE MUCH LOWER THAN EXPECTED 
AND WE ACTUALLY HAD TWO GUYS FROM THE PUB WHO I BELIEVE MAY HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY INTOXICATED TWO DRUNKS 
WELL THEY WEREN'T DRUNK 
I'M GONNA HAVE A FLYING GUESS AT WHICH ONE THEY LIKED YES THE CIDER 
IT WAS THE CIDER ONE WAS IT YES I DISAGREE WITH THAT 
THEY WEREN'T DRUNK 
THEY GAVE US A GOOD REACTION 
FOR TWO BLOKES THAT ARE JUST BOWLED OUT OF A PUB 
STATISTICALLY IT MEANT NOTHING TWO FELLAS 
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S A BIT OF AN ERROR THERE CLAIRE 
I'VE INNOVATED LOTS OF THINGS IN MY TIME 
ONE THING I'VE LEARNED IS I HAVE TO TAKE MY OWN MIND OFF 
WHAT I THINK IS A SUCCESS AND I HAVE TO LOOK AT AND SEE THE REACTION ON OTHERS 
TO ME IT IS CRITICAL 
DID YOU MANAGE TO PUT ON A LITTLE SHOW FOR PEOPLE YEAH 
HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU GET FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PEOPLE USEFUL TO YOU WAS IT YES ALL AGES 
ANYWAY LUCINDA WHAT DID YOU END UP WITH THEN 
AVOCADO AND CHILLI 
AVOCADO AND CHILLI DELICIOUS 
AND TOFFEE APPLE 
GOOD TEAM LEADER VERY GOOD SIR ALAN 
YES I THINK SHE RAN THE BACK OFFICE VERY VERY WELL AND THAT'S WHY OUR PRODUCT WAS SO GOOD 
THIS WAS THE FIRST TASK I SAW LUCINDA BE VERY POSITIVE 
WHICH MAKES A CHANGE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU 
I WOULDN'T PUT MY HAND UP AND SAY SHE WAS A GREAT TEAM LEADER 
LET'S GET ON TO SELLING 
LUCINDA PUT ME AS SECOND IN COMMAND OF RAEF AND JENNIFER WE MANAGED TO BOOK SIX APPOINTMENTS 
THREE OF THEM MADE THEIR OWN ICE CREAM 
THREE MADE THEIR OWN ICE CREAM YES 
DIDN'T YOU THINK OF INQUIRING ABOUT THAT FIRST OF ALL BEFORE YOU WASTED YOUR TIME GOING 
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU SIR ALAN EVEN HAD YOU SAID 
I MAKE MY OWN ICE CREAM I WOULD HAVE STILL TURNED UP WHY 
BECAUSE OF MY BELIEF IN THE PRODUCT 
IF YOU PHONED ME UP AND SAID I WANT TO COME AND SHOW YOU MY LATEST SATELLITE RECEIVER 
AND I SAID LOOK SON I MAKE THEM MYSELF ARE YOU STILL GONNA TURN UP 
IF I HAVE ABSOLUTE BELIEF IN THE PRODUCT I WILL TRY TO SELL YOU ONE 
YOU'D BE WASTING YOUR BLOODY TIME IN THAT INSTANCE 
DID YOU SELL TO ANY OF THOSE THREE THAT MAKE THEIR OWN ICE CREAM 
NO SIR ALAN O. K. 
AT THAT STAGE ONE ACTUALLY WANTED TO MIX THE TEAMS 
I WANTED SOMEONE FROM THE KITCHEN ON THE MARKETING TEAM AND VICE VERSA 
GOOD IDEA A VERY GOOD IDEA WHAT HAPPENED DID YOU DO THAT 
UM 
I DIDN'T DO THAT AND I DIDN'T DO THAT FOR VERY GOOD REASON 
IT'S A GREAT IDEA I HAVE OFTEN USED THAT MYSELF TO HAVE SOMEONE FROM THE 
SHOP FLOOR WHO KNOWS WHAT GOES IN THE STUFF TO BE OUT SELLING 
THE RESPONSE I GOT WAS VERY NEGATIVE AND 
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE PUTTING PEOPLE IN A POSITION IN AN UNHAPPY TEAM 
CAN I JUST SAY I NOT ONCE EXPRESSED NEGATIVITY 
I SAID I'M HAPPY TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT 
LISTEN THAT WAS A VERY GOOD IDEA YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE IT 
YOU SHOULD HAVE ASSERTED YOUR AUTHORITY AND YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO 
NOW MARGARET LET'S HAVE ALPHA'S NUMBERS FIRST OF ALL SHALL WE 
ALPHA HAVE TOTAL ORDERS OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE POINT SIX FOUR 
THAT'S GOOD 
AND NICK 
RENAISSANCE CAME HOME WITH ORDERS TOTALLING ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE POINT FOUR FIVE 
VERY GOOD THAT EIGHT HUNDRED QUID DEAL GOT YOU HOME 
LOOK THE GOOD NEWS HERE IS THAT IT'S NOT THE ABSOLUTE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU TOOK TODAY 
YOU SEE IN THE TRADE BUSINESS THIS IS LIKE GOLD DUST 
YOU'VE FOUND THIS FARMER THIRTEEN NEW OUTLETS WHERE HE'S NOT ONLY GOING TO 
ENJOY THE SALES THAT YOU HAVE MADE BUT HE'S GONNA HOPEFULLY ENJOY FUTURE BUSINESS WITH THEM 
THAT IS GOLD DUST TO HIM THAT'S VERY VERY WELL DONE 
IN RETURN FOR THAT I HAVE GOT A HELICOPTER STANDING BY FOR YOU ALL 
YOU'RE GOING OFF TO BOWOOD ESTATE IN WILTSHIRE WHERE YOU WILL BE LEARNING ARCHERY AND GOLF 
HAVE A GOOD TIME 
I'LL SEE YOU ON THE NEXT TASK 
LUCINDA 
DESPITE TAKING ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY YOUR TEAM LOST 
WE NEED TO UNRAVEL THIS OFF YOU GO 
DONE A BIT OF GOOD FOR BRITISH FARMERS ANYWAY 
YOUR LITTLE CHAT HAS DONE SOME GOOD WITH CLAIRE 
IT APPEARS SO YES SHE SEEMS A CHANGED PERSON 
SHE SEEMS SO SHE GOT THE SUPPORT OF HER TEAM 
THAT SHE'S TAKEN ON BOARD WHAT I'VE SAID MAKES A CHANGE BUT ANYWAY THERE YOU GO 
LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS 
OH SHIT OH 
YES 
I'M SO HAPPY 
SO YOU SHOULD BE I JUST WANT TO SAY A BIG BIG THANK YOU 
MY NECK WAS ON THE LINE I OWE A LOT TO ALL OF YOU FOR WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD 
THE OTHER TEAM HAD THE AUDACITY TO TELL US THAT WE'VE LOST 
JEN SAID TO ME YESTERDAY WHEN I CAME BACK 
WE WON KIND OF LIKE THAT RIGHT IN OUR FACES 
YOU DON'T CACKLE AND HACKLE LIKE WITCHES ROUND A CAULDRON 
WE PROVED THEM WRONG DIDN'T WE WE DID WE SMASHED THEM 
ANYWAY WHO'S HAVING THE LAST LAUGH NOW 
NOT ONCE DID I EVER SAY I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD SPLIT THE TEAMS 
IF YOU'RE GONNA ACCUSE ME OF SOMETHING MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE 
IT'S THE LOOKS YOU GAVE ALSO PEOPLE IN THIS TEAM WERE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH HOW YOU WERE AND HOW YOU ARE 
WHO I'M NOT GOING TO BE NAME CALLING HERE THEY CAN STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES 
GUYS LISTEN TO ME HERE NOT ONCE DID ANYBODY SAY THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE TEAM 
AND AS SOON AS YOU'RE IN THE BOARDROOM THERE'S A FUCKING ISSUE 
EXCUSE ME THAT'S BULLSHIT 
WE GAVE LUCINDA OUR FULL BACKING 
LISTEN TO ME SHE DID LEAD BY EXAMPLE JEN I DIDN'T SAY YOU WERE A 
BAD PROJECT MANAGER I JUST THOUGHT 
IT WAS INDIFFERENT TO ME JEN IS LOOKING AFTER HERSELF SHE CAN BE QUITE VICIOUS 
SHE IS VERY VERY BITCHY 
LUCINDA EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS IN ALL HONESTY SHE DID LISTEN SHE TOOK ON BOARD FEEDBACK 
SHE FINALLY GOT HER FINGER OUT OF HER ARSE 
I WOULD FIRE JEN BECAUSE SHE IS MANIPULATIVE SHE MAKES PEOPLE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE 
I DO NOT TRUST HER AND I WOULD NOT HAVE HER WORKING IN MY BUSINESS 
I AM ABSOLUTELY GUTTED 
I FELT THAT THIS WAS ONE OF MY BEST TASKS 
TYPICAL ISN'T IT GUTTED 
COULD YOU SEND THE CANDIDATES IN PLEASE THANK YOU 
SIR ALAN'S READY FOR YOU NOW 
THE KEY TO THIS TASK IS GETTING PEOPLE TO BUY FROM YOU TO ACTUALLY CREATE SOME LEADS 
YOU HAD SIX LEADS THREE OF WHICH MAKE THEIR OWN ICE CREAM 
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING MARKETING TEAM 
WE MADE AS MANY CALLS AS WE COULD ON DAY ONE 
WE MANAGED TO BOOK SIX APPOINTMENTS 
ADMITTEDLY SOME OF THEM WERE NOT AS GOOD QUALITY AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT I THINK 
AS A THREESOME WE PUT OUR ALL INTO EVERYTHING WE DID AND WE 
THESE ARE ALL CLICHES WE PUT OUR ALL IN WE GAVE IT OUR ALL WE DID OUR BEST 
YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW I DON'T LIKE ALL THAT 
I LIKE TO HEAR SPECIFIC DETAILS 
HELENE AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING PHONED UP COLD CALLED AND GOT AN APPOINTMENT THIS IS NOT HER BAG 
THIS IS YOUR BAG I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE 
I AM NOT A SALES PERSON 
HOWEVER THAT IS ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS I ASKED WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN BUYING ICE CREAM 
IN A NUTSHELL HELENE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE OF THIS TASK 
THERE HAS TO BE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE SALES SIDE 
THE PRODUCTION OF THIS PRODUCT WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
LUCINDA WE SPOKE EARLIER THAT YOU WANTED TO SPREAD THE EXPERIENCE 
YES WHO WAS THE MAIN OPPOSITION TO NOT WANTING TO DO THAT 
THE NON VERBAL CUES AND JENNIFER JENNIFER 
DID YOU WANT TO FLIP TEAMS 
I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH SPLITTING THE TEAM 
I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF DOING THE PITCH OR WHOEVER 
I WAS ALSO SCARED BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN CERTAIN CONVERSATIONS AND YOUR MANNER IN TREATING PEOPLE 
THE PEOPLE I HAVE IN MY BUSINESS I WANT TO ENSURE THEY ARE GOING TO BE TREATING THEIR TEAM APPROPRIATELY 
AND THE PUBLIC APPROPRIATELY AND I KNOW THAT HELENE HAD ALREADY RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT YOU 
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE PUTTING HER IN WITH YOU BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD WORK 
WHAT CONCERN ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO 
HELENE CAN YOU JUST CLARIFY THE CONCERN 
THAT'S NOT TRUE WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT'S NOT TRUE YOU'D SAID TO ME 
YOU FEEL THAT SHE'S A SNAKE SHE'S EVIL AND SHE'S DETRIMENTAL 
DON'T SPEAK ON MY BEHALF 
BELIEVE ME I'M A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD WOMAN 
IF I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WORKING WITH JENNIFER I WOULD HAVE SAID SO 
IF I WAS GOING TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE WORKING WITH ANYONE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU 
YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU LIKE BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE YOU 
CAN WE GET OFF THIS CAN WE BRING IT BACK TO BUSINESS 
ONE LARGE DEAL FROM CINEMA GROUP 
YOU OFFERED THEM EXCLUSIVITY WITHOUT BEING ASKED THEY ACCEPTED THE PRICE YOU QUOTED 
WHAT EXCLUSIVITY 
I OFFERED THEM EXCLUSIVITY IF THEY TOOK THE DEAL 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD BUSINESS DECISION TO MAKE 
THEY HAD A LOT OF CINEMAS 
ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY 
EXCLUSIVITY FOR THE WHOLE OF LONDON FOR CINEMAS 
YEP AND THAT WAS OFFERED 
I OFFERED THEM THAT YEAH 
ON WHAT BASIS WOULD YOU DO THAT 
LET ALONE YOUR OWN TEAM LEADER SURELY THE FARMER SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSULTED 
I THOUGHT THE FARMER WOULD BE VERY HAPPY BECAUSE I KNEW THEY COULD 
HANDLE THE ORDERS AND BE ABLE TO COPE WITH THE ORDERS REQUIRED 
THIS PARTICULAR MOB HAVE GOT ABOUT ELEVEN CINEMAS HAVEN'T THEY 
THEY HAVE MORE AROUND THE COUNTRY TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY WHATEVER 
IF THE GUY HAD ONE THOUSAND CINEMAS I COULD UNDERSTAND 
RAEF DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE EXCLUSIVITY WAS YOU THERE 
I WAS MOST CERTAINLY THERE I WAS PRESENT WE DIDN'T DISCUSS EXCLUSIVITY PRIOR TO THE APPOINTMENT 
IN HINDSIGHT OBVIOUSLY WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT WAS AN OVERSIGHT 
SO ARE YOU SAYING JENNIFER JUST DID IT ON THE FLY ON HER OWN THEN 
I THINK JENNIFER WAS JUST ATTRACTED BY DOING THE DEAL 
YOU CAN DO ANY DEAL CAN'T YOU REALLY 
YOU CAN SAY BUY SEVENTEEN POTS OF ICE CREAM OFF OF ME AND I'LL GIVE YOU A ROLLS ROYCE 
WE KEEP ON TALKING ABOUT THE EXCLUSIVITY OF ONE DEAL BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY ON TWO 
LINDI AGREED TO THE EXCLUSIVITY WITH THE PUB IS THAT RIGHT 
THE PUB IS AN OFFER OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR THREE MONTHS AND ONLY FOR CHAINS CHAINS OF PUBS 
YOU SOLD TO INDIVIDUAL PUBS CHAIN MEXICAN IS A CHAIN 
O. K. RIGHT WELL THAT WAS LAST MINUTE AND THAT WAS IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT 
YOU HAD NO RIGHT OFFERING ANY EXCLUSIVITY WHATSOEVER 
FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE NOT AUTHORISED TO DO THAT 
YOU'RE OUT REPRESENTING A FARMER WHO IS TRYING TO BUILD UP A BUSINESS IN LONDON 
AND THERE YOU ARE GIVING AWAY HIS TOTAL OPPORTUNITY NOW OF SELLING TO CINEMAS 
AND YOU ARE GIVING AWAY THREE MONTHS' WORTH OF EXCLUSIVITY TO BARS I DIDN'T GIVE IT AWAY 
THE GENTLEMAN ASKED FOR IT 
BECAUSE HE ASKED FOR IT DOESN'T MEAN HE CAN HAVE IT 
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TURN A DEAL DOWN A DEAL WHICH IS NOT GOOD FOR THE LONG TERM OF THE BUSINESS 
DID YOU CANCEL ANY OTHER APPOINTMENTS AFTER YOU'D GRANTED EXCLUSIVITY 
YEAH WE THERE YOU GO YOU'VE EVEN DONE IT YOURSELF 
YOU'VE DONE IT YOURSELF YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED TO YOURSELVES HOW YOU HAVE LIMITED THE FARMER'S BUSINESS 
HAD I KNOWN THIS EARLIER ON THESE SALES WOULD HAVE BEEN VOID IN WHICH CASE YOU WOULD HAVE LOST BIG TIME 
LUCINDA WILL YOU TELL ME THE TWO PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO BRING BACK INTO THIS BOARDROOM 
JENNIFER 
AND LINDI 
O. K. THE OTHER THREE GO BACK TO THE HOUSE 
YOU THREE WAIT OUT THERE AND I'LL CALL YOU BACK IN SHORTLY SORRY 
YOU DON'T GO TO A CINEMA AND SAY OOH I'M GOING TO SEE THAT FILM 
TODAY BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT TOFFEE APPLE ICE CREAM IT'S A NONSENSE ANYWAY 
SHE WANTED TO SNATCH A SALE 
THE THING IS THIS LUCINDA HAS 
BLOSSOMED A LITTLE BIT IN MANAGEMENT OR AM I OVERCOOKING THAT 
NO TO START OFF WITH SHE WAS MANAGING THEM WELL 
I'M NOT SURE THAT ON DAY TWO SHE HAD ENOUGH DRIVE OR SHE PUSHED THEM ENOUGH TO MAKE THE SALES 
I'D SAY HER SPREAD OF SKILLS IS GREATER THAN THOSE POSSESSED BY LINDI 
POSSIBLY YEAH 
HELLO 
SEND THE THREE CANDIDATES IN FRANCES PLEASE 
SIR ALAN'S READY FOR YOU NOW 
LUCINDA I MADE YOU THE TEAM LEADER AND O. K. YOU CAME UP WITH SOME GOOD STUFF IN THE KITCHEN 
BUT I THINK YOU DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH CONTROL WITH THE MARKETING PEOPLE AND THAT'S A BIG FLAW 
WITH THIS TASK EVERYONE SAID THEY ENJOYED IT AND THAT IT WORKED WELL 
ENJOYED IT 
MY PEOPLE ENJOY THEMSELVES WHEN THEY GO OFF TO LAS VEGAS 
WHETHER IT BRINGS IN ANY BLOODY MONEY IS ANOTHER STORY 
IT'S NOT ABOUT ENJOYMENT I DIDN'T SEND YOU OUT TO THE FUNFAIR 
ABSOLUTELY I TAKE YOUR POINT 
IN TERMS OF THE PLANNING I PLANNED WHO WAS GOING ON EACH TEAM TO ENSURE WE HAD A GOOD BALANCE 
THAT WORKED VERY WELL YOU THINK YOU USED YOUR SKILLS THAT YOU DO FOR YOUR DAY JOB DO YOU 
YES I DO I REALLY DO 
YOUR FORTE IS RISK ASSESSMENT IS THAT RIGHT 
WELL YOU'D BETTER START ASSESSING THE RISK OF YOU GETTING FIRED HERE 
SIR ALAN I BELIEVE YOU SHOULDN'T FIRE ME 
BECAUSE NOT ONLY AM I DEDICATED I AM HARD WORKING REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAS BEEN FED BACK THROUGH 
I HAVE LED THIS TEAM EXEMPLARY 
WE HAVE COME BACK WITH NINE DIFFERENT LEADS 
NOT ONLY DID I CONSIDER IT FROM THE SALE SIDE I CONSIDERED IT FROM THE FARM SIDE 
LINDI YES SIR ALAN YOU WERE MADE DEPUTY TEAM LEADER THAT RAN THE SALES AND MARKETING YES CORRECT 
YOU LOST THIS TASK ON THE SALES WHICH YOU WERE PUT IN CHARGE OF 
I DON'T THINK MY 
THE GUIDANCE I GAVE TO THE GUYS WHEN BOOKING APPOINTMENTS WAS TO 
CALL PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY THAT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BUY 
IN REGARDS TO THE EXCLUSIVITY SITUATION WHEN WE WERE IN THE 
FIRST MEETING AT THE CINEMA JENNIFER OFFERED EXCLUSIVITY IN THE MEETING 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM WHY DIDN'T YOU PIPE UP AT THAT POINT 
IF I DID THAT AT THAT POINT ONE THINK THE POTENTIAL WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT WE WOULD HAVE LOST THEM AS A CUSTOMER 
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO 
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO YOU CAN'T GIVE AWAY THE SHOP CAN YOU 
NO I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU SIR ALAN 
I THINK WE'RE MISSING A VITAL POINT HERE 
LINDI WAS MADE SECOND IN COMMAND 
SHE WAS THERE ON ALL MY PITCHES THERE ON MY PHONE CALLS THERE WHEN I MADE 
AND I DID SAY TO YOU JENNIFER AFTER THE FIRST MEETING WHEN YOU HAD TO CANCEL THE MEETING WITH THE 
OTHER CINEMA THAT I THINK WE MADE A MISTAKE MAKING THAT EXCLUSIVITY DEAL 
SO WHY DID YOU AGREE TO THE EXCLUSIVITY WITH THE BAR 
WE ALL AGREED WE MADE A TEAM DECISION IF YOU REMEMBER WHEN HE SAID 
IT'S A TEAM DECISION WITH THAT BUT NOT WITH A PICTURE HOUSE YOU SAID IT WITHOUT CONSULTING ANYBODY 
IT CAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH WITHOUT CONSULTING ANYBODY 
JENNIFER WHY SHOULDN'T I FIND YOU 
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD BE FIRED BECAUSE OF THE DECISION I MADE WITH THE EXCLUSIVITY 
IF YOU ASK ANY PROJECT MANAGER APART FROM LUCINDA WHO I WORKED WITH 
THEY WILL TELL YOU I HAVE GIVEN MY ABSOLUTE SUPPORT 
WOULD YOU GO ALONG WITH THAT 
I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THERE IS A BIT OF A CHILL IN THE AIR REALLY 
BETWEEN YOU AND THE OTHERS THAT'S MY OBSERVATION 
WHAT CONTRIBUTION DO YOU THINK SHE MAKES IN TASKS IS IT MAINLY SALES 
YEAH AND SHE'S GOOD I'M NOT A BAD APPLE IF YOU ARE GONNA FIRE ANYBODY IT SHOULD NOT BE ME 
IT SHOULD BE LUCINDA I'M TRYING TO LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE 
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE BEST CANDIDATE YOU DON'T WANT SOMEBODY IN YOUR ORGANISATION WHO LIES 
FIRST AND FOREMOST I HAVE NEVER LIED AND I WOULD NOT LIE 
AND WHO SHIFTS THE BLAME AND RESPONSIBILITY ON TO OTHERS 
LINDI WHY SHOULDN'T I FIND YOU I'VE BEEN ON THE WINNING TEAM THREE TIMES OUT OF FIVE 
I BELIEVE IF I HADN'T BEEN THERE 
MY PROBLEM WITH YOU IS I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING REALLY I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN LUCKY 
NO AS SECOND IN COMMAND I ACHIEVED EVERYTHING 
WHO SHOULD GET FIRED THEN WHO SHOULD GET FIRED 
IF IT'S BASED ON JUST THIS TASK 
NO NO DON'T MIND ABOUT BASED ON 
WHO SHOULD GET FIRED FOR THIS TASK 
CAN I JUST SAY ONE MORE THING 
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I'M EXHAUSTED LISTENING TO YOU O. K. I'M SORRY SIR ALAN 
I THINK BASED ON THIS TASK I WOULD FIRE JENNIFER BUT THROUGHOUT THE SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE 
CAN I JUST BUTT IN ON THAT BECAUSE 
THIS IS MY ONLY CHANCE I'LL GET TO SAY THIS 
THROUGHOUT THE TASK YOU CONGRATULATED ME TOLD ME I WAS DOING A GREAT JOB 
YOU SAID YOU'VE BEEN THE SUPERSTAR OF THIS TASK 
YEAH AND YOUR WORDS TO ME AT THE END OF THE DAY WAS LINDI YOU LED FROM THE FRONT YOU LED BY EXAMPLE 
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I DID 
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THE EXCLUSIVITY JENNIFER O. K. 
LUCINDA RISK ASSESSMENT MANAGER HAVE YOU ASSESSED YOUR RISK YET 
WHAT IS THE RISK HERE OF YOU GETTING FIRED 
THE PROBABILITY IS ONE IN THREE 
OH THAT'S GREAT THAT'S BRILLIANT 
WHAT A BRAINSTORM THAT WAS 
DO I NEED RISK ASSESSMENT MANAGERS 
I'VE NEVER NEEDED A RISK ASSESSMENT MANAGER THE WHOLE OF MY LIFE I TAKE RISKS 
JENNIFER THE EXCLUSIVITY THING THE THING YOU TOOK ON YOUR OWN BACK IS UNFORGIVABLE 
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER YOU GET ON WITH PEOPLE 
I DO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS VERY GOOD AT SALES BUT I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE 
WHO'S GOT A FEW MORE SKILLS OTHER THAN SALES 
ABSOLUTELY 
LINDI YOU WERE SECOND IN COMMAND 
SECOND IN COMMAND FOR WHAT I THINK WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS 
TASK IDENTIFYING THE CUSTOMERS AND THE SELLING OF THE MERCHANDISE 
IT'S SALES THAT YOU LOST THIS TASK ON AND THAT BRINGS ME TO A CONCLUSION 
THAT LINDI YOU'RE FIRED 
JENNIFER YOU SAY IN YOUR APPLICATION 
ONE OF YOUR WORST BUSINESS QUALITIES IS GIVING IDIOTS A SECOND CHANCE 
MAYBE SOMETHING'S RUBBED OFF IN THIS ROOM BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A SECOND CHANCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
GO BACK TO THE HOUSE AND I'LL SEE YOU ON THE NEXT TASK THANK YOU 
LINDI HAD TO GO 
SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF THAT SALES TEAM AND ULTIMATELY SHE'S GOT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS FAILURE 
INCLUDING TELLING PEOPLE NOT TO GIVE EXCLUSIVITY 
BACK AT THE HOUSE THE REMAINING CANDIDATES WAIT TO SEE WHO HAS SURVIVED THE BOARDROOM 
I THINK LUCINDA'S COMING BACK I WOULD HAPPILY BET MY HOUSE THAT SHE'S NOT COMING BACK 
LINDI IS DEFINITELY COMING BACK 
I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF JENNIFER AT ALL 
I THINK SHE COMES ACROSS AS A BIT OF A WANNABE ICE QUEEN 
OH MY GOD 
DAMN I'VE JUST LOST MY MONEY 
I THOUGHT LUCINDA WAS GONE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT YOU WAS A GOOD TEAM MANAGER I THOUGHT LINDI SOLD 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST DEALS OF THE DAY 
I MADE A FUCKING RIDICULOUS MISTAKE AND I PUT MY HAND UP AND SAID THE EXCLUSIVITY 
ANOTHER POINT THAT CAME ACROSS WAS THAT I WAS QUITE COLD 
APPARENTLY 
LUCINDA SAID THAT HELENE SAID THAT I WAS A BIT OF A SNAKE 
I WAS A BIT OF A BITCH I WAS TOLD THAT TWO NIGHTS AGO 
I TELL YOU WHAT THAT'S PISSED ME OFF DON'T USE ME 
I WAS ASKED WHY I DIDN'T MIX THE GROUPS AND I GAVE MY REASONING 
FUCKING BULLSHIT IF I'VE GOT THAT WRONG THEN I'M VERY CONFUSED IF YOU'VE GOT THAT WRONG 
I THINK SIR ALAN DIDN'T SEE ENOUGH FROM ME 
I AM PROBABLY STILL IN A STATE OF SHOCK AS TO WHY HE HASN'T UNDERSTOOD HOW SPECIAL I AM 
HE MUST HAVE MISSED THAT POINT 
ONE JOB NOW ELEVEN CANDIDATES 
SIR ALAN'S SEARCH FOR HIS APPRENTICE CONTINUES 
NEXT WEEK YOU'RE GONNA COME UP WITH YOUR OWN SPECIAL OCCASION 
THE CANDIDATES GET INTO THE GREETING CARD BUSINESS 
WE'VE CREATED NOT JUST A CARD I BELIEVE WE'VE CREATED AN INDUSTRY 
IT'S GOOD TO BE SINGLE IT'S COOL TO BE SINGLE 
WILL THEY BE FULL OF IDEAS 
A HOUSE WITH NO INSULATION IS A CRIME AGAINST THE NATION 
OR HOT AIR 
YEAH WHOO THAT'S GOOD 
THIS WHOLE TASK TURNED OUT A FIASCO YOU'RE FIRED
