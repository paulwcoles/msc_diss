ONE THAT MORE THAN ANY OTHER LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR OWN SOCIETY 
WHEN YOU THINK OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS YOU THINK OF DEMOCRACY THEATRE 
MUSIC MATHEMATICS BUT WHAT APPEALS TO ME IS THEIR SHEER INGENUITY 
JOIN ME AND THE TEAM AS WE BRING ANCIENT GREEK TECHNOLOGY TO LIFE 
MASTER CRAFTSMAN MARTY JOPSON WILL BE ATTEMPTING TO RECREATE THE FIRST EVER ROBOT 
QUITE A BEAST THIS MACHINE WE'LL TRY OUT A TWO THOUSAND YEAR OLD DEATH RAY 
AND I'LL BE TESTING SOME OTHER DEADLY WEAPONS 
AND ROVING REPORTER HERMIONE COCKBURN WILL BE OFF TO GREECE 
VISITING THE VERY PLACES WHERE HISTORY WAS MADE 
ONE OF THESE FAULTS PASSES DIRECTLY BENEATH THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO 
BY ITS HEIGHT IN THE FIFTH CENTURY B. C. THE WORLD OF ANCIENT GREECE 
WAS BASED ON HUNDREDS OF CITY STATES SCATTERED AROUND THE MEDITERRANEAN 
IN THE WORDS OF THE PHILOSOPHER PLATO 
LIKE FROGS AROUND A POND WE GREEKS HAVE SETTLED ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA 
AND WHERE THEY SETTLED THEY BUILT TEMPLES AND CITIES AND CARRIED OUT GREAT FEATS OF ENGINEERING 
HERMIONE HAS GONE IN SEARCH OF ONE OF THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENTS 
MY JOURNEY TOOK ME ON A VOYAGE ACROSS THE AEGEAN TO THE ISLAND OF SAMOS JUST OFF THE COAST OF TURKEY 
IN 
THIS ISOLATED LITTLE ISLAND WAS A GREEK STRONGHOLD FACING THE HOSTILE PERSIAN EMPIRE ON THE MAINLAND 
LOOK HOW CLOSE IT IS TO ITS NEIGHBOUR MODERN TURKEY 
THE PEOPLE OF SAMOS WERE WORRIED THAT IF THE PERSIANS INVADED THEY'D BE CUT OFF FROM THEIR WATER SUPPLY 
AND WOULD HAVE TO SURRENDER OR DIE OF THIRST 
THAT'S BECAUSE IN ANCIENT TIMES THE SPRING WHICH SUPPLIED THE TOWN'S WATER 
WAS OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS AND VULNERABLE TO ATTACK 
SO THE PEOPLE OF SAMOS DECIDED TO TRY TO PIPE THE WATER INTO TOWN AS IT IS TODAY 
BUT THERE WAS ONE PROBLEM THERE WAS A MOUNTAIN IN THE WAY 
MOUNT CASTRO 
TWO HUNDRED FORTY METRES HIGH AND ONE THOUSAND METRES WIDE 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING FOR IT MOVE THE TOWN OR TUNNEL THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN WHICH IS WHAT THEY DID 
THIS IS THE ENTRANCE TO THE EUPALINOS TUNNEL NAMED AFTER THE ENGINEER WHO BUILT IT 
IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST FEATS OF ENGINEERING IN THE ANCIENT WORLD 
THE TUNNEL WAS ONLY WIDE ENOUGH TO ALLOW TWO TO DIG AT ANY ONE TIME 
AND REMEMBER THIS WAS IN A TIME BEFORE POWER TOOLS THE ONLY POWER WAS MUSCLE 
IT WAS A DANGEROUS JOB BECAUSE THIS PART OF THE TUNNEL IS GOING THROUGH AN AREA OF WEAKER ROCK 
AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THE WHOLE THING HAS HAD TO BE REINFORCED 
WITH SUCH AN ARDUOUS UNDERTAKING IT'S NOT SURPRISING THEY DIDN'T PROCEED VERY QUICKLY 
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TUNNELLED BETWEEN TWELVE AND FIFTEEN CENTIMETRES A DAY 
WHICH IS ONLY THAT FAR WHICH WOULD HAVE AMOUNTED TO ONLY FIFTY METRES A YEAR 
BACK IN THAT WAS A LUXURY THAT THEY JUST COULDN'T AFFORD 
TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF DEFENDING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE PERSIANS 
THE PEOPLE OF SAMOS NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE TUNNEL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FROM THIS END 
BECAUSE USING MORE LABOURERS SIMPLY WIDENS THE TUNNEL IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU PROCEED ANY QUICKER 
BUT FORTUNATELY EUPALINOS WAS A VERY PRACTICAL MAN 
SO HE DECIDED TO START DIGGING ANOTHER TUNNEL FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN' 
AND THIS IS A STROKE OF GENIUS 
THIS IS THE POINT WHERE THE TWO TUNNELS MEET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOUNTAIN 
EUPALINOS KNEW THE TUNNELS WOULD MEET 
WHICH IS AMAZING GIVEN THAT HE HAD NO MODERN TECHNOLOGY LIKE LASERS TO GUIDE HIM 
THE QUESTION IS HOW ON EARTH DID EUPALINOS MANAGE IT 
IT'S A VERY BIG MOUNTAIN AND A VERY SMALL TUNNEL 
AND THERE WAS EVERY CHANCE OF THE TEAMS MISSING COMPLETELY 
WE'VE DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE SO I'VE GOT MY OWN MOUNT CASTRO HERE AN ENORMOUS MOUNTAIN 
WE COULDN'T FIND ANY ANCIENT GREEK TUNNELLERS SO WE'VE CHOSEN SOME ANCIENT HISTORY STUDENTS 
HERE'S MARTY WITH THE GIRLS' TEAM YEAH AND ON THE SOUTH SIDE WE'VE TRACEY WITH THE BOYS' TEAM 
YEAH THE MOUNTAIN IS TOO HIGH FOR THEM TO SEE ONE ANOTHER 
SO THEY CAN'T TELL WHICH WAY TO TUNNEL AND WE'LL HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT 
O. K. GUYS GET YOUR PIPE GOING IN HERE WE'VE STARTED A HOLE FOR YOU IN THE MOUNTAIN 
AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO TUNNEL THROUGH YOU HEARD THEM ROARING OVER THE OTHER SIDE GO IN THAT DIRECTION 
NOW CHAPS IF YOU'D ALSO START TUNNELLING TOWARDS THOSE GIRLS 
HERE INTO THIS HOLE SEE IF YOU CAN MEET THEM IN THE MIDDLE 
THE QUESTION IS CAN THEY DO IT BY PURE CHANCE OR GUESSWORK OR DEAD RECKONING 
THERE WAS LOTS OF CHANCE TO MISS IN THE MOUNTAIN EVEN WHEN THEY STARTED TUNNELLING BUT WILL THEY MEET 
WE'VE GOT A DOOR IN OUR MOUNTAIN AND I CAN FIND OUT HAVE A LOOK AT THIS 
AGH THEY'RE COMPLETELY HOPELESS 
MILES APART THEY COULD TUNNEL FOR EVER AND THEY'D NEVER MEET 
O. K. CHAPS TAKE YOUR PIPES OUT 
WHAT THEY NEED IS GEOMETRY 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS TO MEASURE RIGHT ANGLES AND TO DO IT ACCURATELY 
THIS WAS THE SORT OF EQUIPMENT THEY USED 
A POST WHICH THEY'D STICK IN THE GROUND RATHER THAN HAVING A BASE THEN A CROSS ON TOP 
FOUR ARMS WOODEN ARMS WITH A STRING HANGING FROM EACH END AND A WEIGHT 
YOU NEED TO STOP THEM SWINGING AND THEN LINE UP 
THIS IS YOUR FIRST LINE ALONG WHICH YOU WANT TO MEASURE A RIGHT ANGLE THEN YOU KNOW THAT IS A RIGHT ANGLE 
SO YOU LINE UP THE NEXT TWO STRINGS AND THERE YOU'VE GOT AN EXACT RIGHT ANGLE BETWEEN HERE AND HERE 
SIMPLY BECAUSE THE LENGTH OF THESE ARMS ARE THE SAME 
RIGHT NOW THEN 
STARTING FROM THE FIRST ENTRANCE I'M GOING TO WORK MY WAY ROUND THE MOUNTAIN MARKING OUT RIGHT ANGLES' 
O. K. TEAM COULD YOU GIVE ME YOUR PIPE 
AND LET ME PUT IT INTO THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY O. K. STOP STARTED DIGGING 
MARTY HAS MEASURED THIS ANGLE FOR ME 
THE HYPOTENUSE OF THE TRIANGLE ALONG THE PIPE ALONG THE LINE OF THE TUNNEL 
AND THIS TOUCHING HERE 
IT'S THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE LINE OF THE TUNNEL AND MY FIRST CONSTRUCTION LINE 
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS MEASURE ANGLE A WHERE THE TUNNEL ENTERS THE MOUNTAIN 
THEN MAKE SURE ANGLE B. AT THE OTHER ENTRANCE IS THE SAME AS A AND THE TUNNEL SHOULD MEET IN THE MIDDLE 
SO THAT'S THE ANGLE WE'RE MEASURING YES IF YOU HAVE THAT IN THAT SHOULD HOLD THE ANGLE LEVEL 
TRY AND KEEP YOUR PIPE HORIZONTAL THAT'S THE TRICKY THING HOLD IT HOLD IT 
DON'T DO ANYTHING I'LL MEASURE THE OTHER SIDE 
NOW GO IN TOUCHING YOUR PEG TOUCHING YOUR PEG ON THAT SIDE 
WHAT CHANCES ARE THERE OF MEETING IN THE MIDDLE TUNNEL FASTER TUNNEL FASTER 
AH IT'S GOING CLOSE 
IT'S CLOSE GO ON FANTASTIC 
IT'S ALMOST A PERFECT MATCH WE MIGHT EVEN GET WATER THROUGH THERE WITHOUT EVEN CONNECTING THE THING 
AMAZING 
CONGRATULATIONS BOYS CONGRATULATIONS GIRLS 
NOW I CAN GET MY DRINK 
AND AT LAST WATER IS FLOWING RIGHT THROUGH MOUNT CASTRO 
HOW ARE WE DOING IN THE MIDDLE 
BIT OF A LEAK BUT NOT TOO BAD ARE WE GETTING ANY OUT THE OTHER END 
NOT YET NOT YET POISED TONGUES HANGING OUT THIRSTY 
MORE WATER 
HEY WE'VE GOT WATER 
FANTASTIC 
AND THAT WAS HOW THE PEOPLE OF SAMOS GOT THEIR BEAUTIFUL SPRING WATER FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN 
ONE OF GREECE'S MOST FAMOUS SONS WAS BORN ON SAMOS 
AND HELPED TO MAKE THE ISLAND FAMOUS A LAD CALLED PYTHAGORAS 
HE'S REMEMBERED FOR HIS THEOREM 
THAT IN ANY RIGHT ANGLED TRIANGLE THE SQUARE ON THE HYPOTENUSE 
IS EQUAL TO THE SUM OF THE SQUARES ON THE OTHER TWO SIDES 
PYTHAGORAS WAS A GREAT LOVER OF MUSIC HE PROBABLY INVENTED THE MUSICAL SCALE WE USE TODAY 
HE ALSO INVENTED THE IDEA OF THE HARMONY OF THE SPHERES 
THE FACT THAT THE GAPS BETWEEN THE PLANETS ROUGHLY CORRESPOND TO THE GAPS BETWEEN MUSICAL NOTES 
NOW HOW DID HE COME TO THIS GREAT LOVE OF MUSIC 
ONE DAY HE WAS WANDERING PAST THE BLACKSMITH'S SHOP 
AND HE HEARD THE HAMMERS RINGING ON THE ANVILS AS THEY MADE HORSESHOES OR NAILS OR WHATEVER IT WAS 
AND HE NOTICED THERE WERE DIFFERENT NOTES COMING OUT 
AT FIRST HE THOUGHT SOME OF THE BLACKSMITHS WERE STRONGER OR BIGGER THAN THE OTHERS 
BUT HE INVESTIGATED AND FOUND THAT IT WAS TO DO WITH THE SIZES OF THE ANVILS 
SO HE DID A WHOLE LOT MORE EXPERIMENTS PARTICULARLY WITH STRETCHED STRINGS 
I'M NOT PRETENDING HE HAD A GUITAR I JUST BROUGHT MY OWN BECAUSE IT'S EASIER 
SUPPOSE I SIMPLY TWANG THE BOTTOM STRING AND THEN I MAKE IT HALF THE LENGTH BY FRETTING IT DOWN THERE 
I GET A HIGHER NOTE AND IN FACT THOSE NOTES SOUND FAIRLY SIMILAR 
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE DIFFERENT 
AND IT'S BECAUSE THE HIGHER NOTE IS TWICE THE FREQUENCY 
IT'S WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE OCTAVE OF THE LOWER NOTE 
IT WAS BY DOING THESE EXPERIMENTS THAT HE SET UP THE MUSICAL SCALE 
AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT STEPS FORWARD IN THE WHOLE OF THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE 
BECAUSE HE WAS THE FIRST MAN TO TRY AND APPLY MATHEMATICS TO THE NATURAL WORLD 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE GREEKS HAVE BEEN CREDITED WITH THE FIRST EVER USE OF COMPRESSED AIR 
AN INVENTION WHICH HAS HUNDREDS OF APPLICATIONS TODAY ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOVE DIVING LIKE ME 
THE STORY GOES IT WAS THE GREEK LOVE OF MUSIC THAT LED TO ITS DEVELOPMENT 
IN THE THIRD CENTURY B. C. A YOUNG CHAP CALLED CTESIBIUS WAS HELPING OUT IN HIS DAD'S BARBERSHOP IN ALEXANDRIA 
HIS DAD LIKED TO HOLD UP A MIRROR TO SHOW CUSTOMERS HOW BEAUTIFUL THE HAIRCUT WAS 
BUT IT WAS VERY HEAVY AND CTESIBIUS HAD THE BRIGHT IDEA OF COUNTERBALANCING IT 
SO HE TIED A BIT OF STRING TO THE MIRROR TOOK IT OVER A PULLEY AND BROUGHT IT DOWN TO A LEAD WEIGHT 
BUT THEN THE WEIGHT WOULD SWING AROUND BASHING CUSTOMERS ON THE HEAD SO HE HID IT IN A TUBE 
HE FOUND WHEN HE DROPPED THE WEIGHT DOWN THE TUBE IT MADE A FUNNY NOISE 
A BIT LIKE THAT 
AND THAT ALLEGEDLY GAVE HIM THE IDEA OF INVENTING THE ORGAN TRACEY IS THIS A LIKELY STORY 
WHY NOT HE WAS A VERY CLEVER MAN HE CAME UP WITH ALL SORTS OF DEVICES IN HIS LIFETIME 
ONE OF WHICH PROBABLY AN EARLY ONE IS THE ORGAN 
WHEREBY YOU HAVE PIPES OF DIFFERENT LENGTHS THAT EMIT DIFFERENT NOTES AND YOU CAN MAKE NUMEROUS SOUNDS 
SO YOU'VE JUST GOT TO BLOW AIR THROUGH ALL THESE PIPES 
YES BUT IT'S HANDY IF YOU CAN HAVE A CONTINUOUS SUPPLY 
O. K. IF YOU GIVE ME A SUPPLY OF AIR I'M NOT A MUSICIAN BUT I'LL HAVE A GO AT A TUNE ONE TWO THREE GO 
TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR 
I JUST CAN'T YOU'RE RUNNING OUT I AM RUNNING OUT OF PUFF 
SO THE PROBLEM IS THE CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF AIR DID HE CRACK IT 
YES HE INVENTED A DEVICE TO GET OVER THIS PROBLEM I'VE ASKED MARTY TO REPRODUCE IT SHALL WE GO SEE 
LET'S 
NOW MARTY CAN YOU GIVE US A CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF AIR 
I THINK SO HOW RIGHT WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS A DEVICE WITH THREE CHAMBERS O. K. 
THEY'RE ALL TWO THIRDS FULL OF WATER SO THAT'S THE WATER LEVEL THERE 
THE CRITICAL THING IS THIS CENTRAL CHAMBER HAS A LID ON IT 
AND IN THE LID IS THIS LITTLE HOLE THERE AND IF YOU PLUG YOUR TUBE INTO THAT HOLE AND JAM IT IN 
THAT CHAMBER WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF TRACEY'S LUNGS 
THIS IS OUR AIR SUPPLY YES SO WE DON'T NEED TRACEY 
I START PUMPING AIR AND IT GOES INTO THE CENTRAL CHAMBER 
THE AIR'S COMING FROM THIS FOOT PUMP UP AND OVER AND DOWN AND ROUND THE BOTTOM 
AND AS I PUMP THE AIR IN THE AIR IN HERE AS THIS VOLUME INCREASES PUSHES DOWN ON THE WATER 
WHICH PUSHES WATER OUT THROUGH HOLES AT THE BOTTOM AND UP INTO THE SIDE 
O. K. RIGHT O. K. NOW WHAT THAT MEANS OF COURSE IS THAT WE HAVE A HEIGHT DIFFERENCE IN WATER HERE 
AND IT'S THIS EXTRA BIT OF WATER HERE THAT'S PUSHING DOWN WHICH IS COMPRESSING THE AIR 
CTESIBIUS HAD INVENTED AN AIR COMPRESSOR RELYING ON THE WEIGHT OF WATER 
TO PUT THE AIR UNDER PRESSURE HENCE THE WATER ORGAN 
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY THE TUNE O. K. 
HE WAS A BRIGHT LAD YES HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST INVENTIVE PEOPLE FROM ANTIQUITY HE DESIGNED MANY DEVICES 
SUCH AS THE FORCE PUMP SIMILAR TO THE MACHINE MARTY'S OPERATING WITH A CYLINDER AND A PLUNGER 
THAT'S WHAT DROVE FIRE ENGINES YES THAT'S WHAT PUMPS THE WATER OUT OF A ROMAN FIRE ENGINE 
HEY WE'RE THERE SO NOW WE'VE GOT A COMPRESSOR SUPPLY 
THAT'S IT ALL THIS AIR READY FOR YOU TO USE TO PLAY YOUR TUNE SO THIS IS NOW A WATER ORGAN 
INDEED CAN I PLAY AWAY YOU GO HOLD IT DOWN FOR ME CERTAINLY 
TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR 
CTESIBIUS'S WATER ORGAN WAS ALSO THE WORLD'S FIRST KEYBOARD 
DELICATE ISN'T IT VERY DELICATE BEAUTIFUL SO THAT IS THE WATER ORGAN COURTESY OF CTESIBIUS 
YES LET'S BLOW A BLAST TO HIM 
BY THE TIME OF CTESIBIUS THE GREEK CITY STATES STRETCHED FROM EGYPT IN THE EAST TO SYRACUSE IN THE WEST 
ONE OF THE WAYS THEY REINFORCED THEIR COMMON IDENTITY 
CAME THROUGH EVENTS SUCH AS THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
DRAWING ATHLETES AND CROWDS FROM ALL OVER THE GREEK WORLD 
THE GREEKS WERE THE FIRST TO RECOGNISE THE VALUE OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE SPORT WAS HIGHLY ESTEEMED 
BUT THIS WASN'T ABOUT LOOKING GOOD IT WAS A MILITARY STRATEGY 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES BEGAN IN AND KEPT MEN AT THE PEAK OF FITNESS 
THEY WERE HELD IN WONDERFUL STADIUMS SIMILAR TO THIS ONE AT NEMEA 
I WAS JOINED BY TWELVE BUDDING ATHLETES I'D MET AT LUNCH TO TRY OUT AN EXPERIMENT 
THE GREEKS WERE OBSESSED WITH FAIRNESS 
AND DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES TOUCHED EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR LIFE SPORT WAS NO EXCEPTION 
BUT KEEPING THE GAMES FAIR WAS A LOT EASIER SAID THAN DONE 
SO HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THE RIGHT MAN WINS 
THIS IS A REALLY INGENIOUS DEVICE IT'S CALLED A HYSPLEX AND IT'S BASED ON THE SAME TECHNOLOGY AS A CATAPULT 
AND IT ENSURES THAT THE START OF EACH RACE IS FAIR 
IT USES A TORSION TECHNIQUE TO SNAP DOWN THESE ROPES AND IF YOU TRY TO CHEAT IT SENDS YOU FLYING 
O. K. IF YOU COULD ALL LINE UP PLEASE AND THEN WE CAN SEE HOW THE HYSPLEX ACTUALLY WORKS 
ONE FOOT IN FRONT AND ONE FOOT BACK 
THESE ARE THE STARTING BLOCKS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE USED AND THEN YOU CURL YOUR TOES CURL THEM ROUND 
REALLY CURL THEM ROUND THE STONE THANK YOU RIGHT O. K. ALL SET THERE 
RIGHT O. K. IF YOU'D LIKE TO START THEM PLEASE 
RIGHT IN THE NAME OF HISTORICAL ACCURACY I JUST NEED THEM TO DO IT ONE MORE TIME 
O. K. 
THAT'S GREAT IF YOU COULD NOW JUST TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF SO THIS TAKE IT OFF 
THE STORY GOES THAT DURING A RACE AN ATHLETE TRIPPED ON HIS SKIRT AND FELL AND WAS KILLED 
AND EVER AFTER THE GAMES WERE CARRIED OUT COMPLETELY NAKED 
TAKE THEM OFF I WILL IF YOU WILL HANG ON WE'VE GOT TO STOP THERE 
ANCIENT GREECE WAS A VIOLENT WORLD BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO AN ATHLETE OR SOLDIER WHO BROKE A LEG 
THE ANSWER WAS THE HIPPOCRATIC BENCH 
IT WAS PRETTY TOUGH BEING A SOLDIER YOU HAD TO CARRY HEAVY WEAPONS AND ARMOUR AND STUFF 
THEIR WIVES USED TO TELL THEM COME BACK WITH YOUR SHIELD OR ON IT AS THAT WAS THEIR IDEA OF A STRETCHER 
IN FACT ALL THE SOLDIERS WERE DIVIDED IF YOU LIKE INTO THE FIT AND THE DEAD 
I'VE BROKEN MY LEG I'M ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES WE'VE GOT THIS FABULOUS MARTY ARE YOU SURE 
LIKE A MEDIEVAL TORTURE RACK 
LUCKILY FOR ME EXPERT TRACEY RIHLL REMINDED HIM THAT WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE MADE WAS A MODEL 
OF THE ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED MEDICAL TREATMENTS FROM ANCIENT TIMES' 
IT FEELS LIKE A MEDIEVAL RACK TOO 
SO THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A HIPPOCRATIC BENCH 
NAMED AFTER HIPPOCRATES WHO WAS ONE OF THE GREAT DOCTORS 
HE WAS IF YOU LIKE THE FATHER OF MEDICINE 
AN ENORMOUS COLLECTION OF BOOKS WAS NAMED AFTER HIM EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T WRITE MOST OF THEM 
IN FACT LOTS WERE WRITTEN AFTER HIS DEATH BUT IT WAS A COLLECTION OF ALL THE KNOWN MEDICINE 
EVEN TODAY DOCTORS HAVE TO ABIDE BY WHAT THEY CALL THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH 
THEY PROMISE TO WORK FOR THE GOOD OF THE PATIENT AND BE HONEST AND DISCREET AND ABOVE ALL NOT TO HARM 
SPEAKING OF HARM MARTY HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON 
WE'RE GETTING THERE CAN YOU JUST SIT UP AND TRACEY THIS AROUND THE TOP OF THE THIGH 
YES YOU WANT A STRAP AROUND THE THIGH SO YOU'RE ONLY APPLYING THE TENSION TO THE LEG THAT IS BROKEN 
YOU DON'T WANT TO STRETCH THE REST OF ADAM UNNECESSARILY 
WE'VE GOT TO TENSION THIS ONE SO I'VE GOT TO LEAN FORWARD AGAIN 
LEAN FORWARD A BIT AND GET THIS TENSION 
I GET THE IDEA YOU'RE JUST STRETCHING THE LEG 
JUST THE BIT THAT NEEDS TREATMENT THAT'S RIGHT 
SO YOUR BROKEN BONES ARE NOW BEING 
WELL WHEN BONES BREAK THE MUSCLES ARE SUFFICIENTLY STRONG THAT THEY TEND TO CAUSE THE BONES TO OVERRIDE 
SO YOUR LEG WOULD BE SHORTER IF IT KNITTED IN THAT POSITION THE YOU'D BE PULLED IN CIRCLES 
YES THAT'S RIGHT 
SO THE IDEA IS TO PROVIDE ENOUGH FORCE TO PULL YOUR LEG APART UNTIL THOSE BONES ARE LINED UP AGAIN 
THEN WE CAN APPLY THE TRACTION TO KEEP IT IN THAT POSITION RIGHT THIS IS WHERE THE RODS COME IN 
LET'S JUST MOVE THIS LEG A BIT POP THAT ONE IN THERE LIKE THAT 
OH I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THEN I'LL PUT THIS ONE IN THIS SIDE NEXT AND THESE ARE JUST 
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE RIGHT LENGTH WE MEASURED THEM 
A HIPPOCRATIC DOCTOR WOULD HAVE SEVERAL SETS SO HE COULD ADJUST THE TENSION 
YOU CAN SEE THE TENSION FROM THE BEND OF THE ROD 
THAT'S REALLY GOOD SO IT'S STRETCHING THE LEG ALL THE TIME 
TO KEEP THE BONES IN POSITION WHILE THEY KNIT 
SO ARGUABLY THIS IS BETTER THAN A PLASTER CAST 
BECAUSE IT IS HOLDING THE TENSION ALL THE TIME AND IF YOU HAD AN OPEN WOUND YOU COULD BANDAGE IT UP 
YOU COULD DRESS IT IT'LL KEEP BEDCLOTHES OFF 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS IS YOU CAN SCRATCH IT AND IT DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH IF IT ITCHES 
ANYWAY MARTY COULD YOU POSSIBLY UNTIE ME COS I FEEL I CAN HOBBLE OFF NOW THANKS VERY MUCH 
IT WAS LUCKY THE GREEKS HAD HIPPOCRATES TO CARE FOR THEM 
AS THEY WERE ALWAYS GETTING INTO WARS ESPECIALLY WITH THE ROMANS AND THEIR BURGEONING EMPIRE 
FORTUNATELY THE GREEKS HAD ANOTHER GENIUS INVENTOR WHO WOULD HELP THEM FIGHT BACK WITH DEVASTATING WEAPONS 
IT'S AND SYRACUSE HERE IN SICILY IS A CRITICAL LINK IN THE CHAIN OF AN EMBATTLED GREEK EMPIRE 
THE ROMAN EMPIRE IS ON THE ASCENDANT AND SYRACUSE WAS THEIR NEXT STOP 
THE GREEKS BUILT A NUMBER OF CITY STATES DOTTED AROUND THE MEDITERRANEAN 
AND WHEN ROME BEGAN TO EXPAND SYRACUSE WAS RIGHT IN THE WAY 
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE ROMANS THIS WAS THE HOME OF THE GENIUS ARCHIMEDES 
HE FORTIFIED THE CITY WALLS WITH INCREDIBLE CONTRAPTIONS THAT STOPPED THE ROMAN WAR MACHINE IN ITS TRACKS 
ONE OF THOSE CONTRAPTIONS WAS THE CLAW A KIND OF CRANE THAT REACHED OUT OVER THE CITY WALLS 
GRABBED THE ENEMY ROMAN SHIPS AND DASHED THEM ON THE ROCKS 
ARCHIMEDES WAS THE GREATEST MATHEMATICIAN OF THE ANCIENT WORLD 
PROBABLY THE GREATEST MATHEMATICAL GENIUS UNTIL ISAAC NEWTON 
HIS INVENTIONS RANGED FROM THE FAMOUS ARCHIMEDES SCREW TO WATER CLOCKS PULLEYS WINCHES AND MANY MORE 
WHEN THE ROMAN FLEET APPROACHED SYRACUSE 
LEGEND TELLS US ARCHIMEDES SET FIRE TO THE ENEMY GALLEYS WITH A NEW INVENTION 
BUT HOW DID HE DO IT 
IN A LOCAL SCHOOL THERE'S A STATUE OF ARCHIMEDES WHICH HOLDS A CLUE TO THIS DEVASTATING INVENTION 
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS LARGE DISH WAS A HIGHLY POLISHED BRONZE SHIELD 
THAT HARNESSED THE POWER OF THE SUN 
THE MIRROR ON MY BATHROOM WALL MIGHT DOUBLE AS AN ANCIENT BRONZE SHIELD 
O. K. THE GREEK SOLDIERS MAY HAVE USED THEIR SHIELDS 
AND THEN THEY COULD REFLECT THE SUN ONTO THE BOATS A BIT LIKE THAT 
HOW WOULD IT FEEL TO BE AN INVADING ROMAN ON THE RECEIVING END OF THIS NEW WEAPON 
IF THE GREEK SOLDIERS HAD LINED UP ALONG THE HARBOUR WALLS 
THE REFLECTION OF THE SUN OFF THEIR BRONZE SHIELDS WOULD'VE ACTED LIKE MIRRORS 
CONCENTRATING THE SUN'S ENERGY ONTO THE ROMAN SHIPS 
AND THE SOLDIERS WOULD'VE BEEN DAZZLED IF NOTHING ELSE 
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE WHERE THEY WERE GOING 
WHAT FURTHER DAMAGE COULD THEY DO IF THE GREEKS HAD HUNDREDS OF SHIELDS 
ALL REFLECTING THE POWER OF THE SUN AT THE HAPLESS ROMANS 
MARTY WHAT HAVE YOU GOT HERE WELL I'VE GOT A FEW MIRRORS HERE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR TO BE PRECISE 
WOW ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR HEXAGONAL POLISHED STEEL MIRRORS 
EACH ONE IS HELD IN THE CENTRE AND INDIVIDUALLY ADJUSTABLE 
ON THE BACK ARE FOUR SCREWS FOR EACH MIRROR THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ADJUST IT 
YOU CAN STEER THEM I CAN STEER EACH MIRROR AND FOCUS ONTO A BOAT 
YEAH I HAPPEN TO HAVE A ROMAN BOAT IN MY HAND 
WE'LL SEE DO YOU THINK YOU CAN SET FIRE TO THIS WE'LL TRY POP IT ON THE POST 
O. K. HANG ON A SEC DON'T FIRE YET 
THERE DO YOUR WORST 
HERE WE GO IT'S COMING UP 
OH THAT'S BRIGHT THAT IS VERY BRIGHT 
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT THAT THERE'S SMOKE BEGINNING TO APPEAR ALREADY 
I CAN SEE THE PAINT'S BLISTERING YES T. H. ERE IT IS 
THAT WOULD BE VERY BAD NEWS AND YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY ATTACK NOW WITH THIS BLAST OF RAY GUN IN YOUR EYES 
IF I WERE A ROMAN SAILOR I WOULDN'T FANCY BEING IN THAT BOAT VERY MUCH 
I HAVE TO SAY EVEN THOUGH THERE AREN'T FLAMES YOU HAVE BURNT A HOLE IN THIS BOAT 
I CAN SEE STRAIGHT THROUGH FROM THE INSIDE SO THAT BOAT IS NOW SINKING 
I'VE LOCKED IT OFF SO LET ME HAVE A QUICK LOOK WELL DON'T GET TOO CLOSE 
IT'S TAKEN OUT THAT WHOLE SIDE 
AH IT'S IN FLAMES FLAMES FANTASTIC 
THAT REALLY IS SINKING THAT BOAT 
THERE YOU GO PROOF POSITIVE YES 
AND YOU ONLY NEED ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MIRRORS AND THIS IS IN YOU KNOW IN SOUTHERN ITALIAN SUN 
IT WOULD BE A LOT QUICKER IT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER 
THAT IS SPECTACULAR A FUNERAL PYRE TO THE ROMAN NAVY 
AND A TRIUMPH FOR ARCHIMEDES YEAH ABSOLUTELY GOOD FOR ARCHI 
THE PRESSURE OF WAR FORCED THE GREEKS TO BE INVENTIVE 
THEY WERE AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF WEAPON TECHNOLOGY 
THEIR MILITARY ENGINEERS MADE CLEVER USE OF RATCHETS WINCHES AND MULTIPLE PULLEYS 
THEY SET PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN THAT LASTED FOR ONE THOUSAND YEARS 
BACK IN EVEN THE SIMPLE BOW WAS IMPROVED BY THEIR INVENTIVENESS 
THIS IS DAVID SIMM WHO'S OUR ANCIENT WEAPON EXPERT AND THIS IS A GASTROPHETES OR BELLY BOW 
DAVID SHOW ME RIGHT THAT SLIDER PUSHES FORWARD LIKE THAT 
HOW FAR KEEP GOING UNTIL THE HOOK GOES OVER THE STRING 
I SEE LIKE THAT THAT'S IT NOW PUSH THE TWO BRASS PIECES FORWARD 
THESE ONES YEAH 
AND PULL THE TRIGGER LEVER AROUND TO THE RIGHT 
I SEE SO THAT LOCKS THAT DOWN ONTO THE STRING 
YES GOT YOU O. K. AND THEN 
NOW TO LOAD IT RIGHT 
THIS IS REALLY A CASTLE WALL YES SO YOU SHOVE IT AGAINST THE WALL 
YOU PUSH IT AGAINST THE WALL PUT YOUR BELLY AGAINST IT AND PUSH LIKE THAT AND THAT COCKS IT 
THAT'S CUNNING NOW YOU PUT IT BACK ONTO THE CASTLE WALL PUT IT BACK ONTO THE CASTLE WALL LIKE THAT 
TAKE YOUR ARROW AND THESE ARE JUST ORDINARY ARROWS YES 
AND NOTCH IT NOTCH IT 
WHEN DO YOU FIRE AIM AND YOU PULL THAT LEVER AND 
WOW FANTASTIC POWER YOU RECKON THAT'S TWICE AS POWERFUL AS A NORMAL BOW 
YOU CAN MAKE A BOW THAT'S TWO OR THREE TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN A MAN CAN PULL WITH HIS ARMS 
AND ALL THE STRENGTH IS IN PUSHING THIS FORWARD 
SO YOU CAN KEEP THE ENEMY WELL OUT OF BOW SHOT YES FANTASTIC 
AND YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A SKILLED ARCHER THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY 
THIS WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST MECHANICAL WEAPON OF WAR IT WAS A REAL STEP FORWARD CAN I HAVE A GO 
YES GREAT O. K. SO WAIT A MINUTE PUSH THE THING FORWARD YES 
PUSH THE SLIDER FORWARD LIFT THOSE THAT WAY 
PUSH THE SLIDER FORWARD RIGHT UNTIL WE GET TO THE STRING 
O. K. THEN PUSH THE BRASS PIECES OVER FORWARDS AND LOCK THAT UNDERNEATH 
THAT'S IT NOW I'VE GOT TO TAKE OVER PUT THOSE UNDER YOUR ARMS LIFT IT I SEE LIKE THAT YEAH 
AND THEN DOWN AGAINST THE GROUND OR THE CASTLE WALL IF YOU'VE GOT ONE YES PUSH 
THAT SHOULD DO IT BACK OH IT'S QUITE HEAVY ISN'T IT 
REST IT BACK ON O. K. NOW WHICH ARROW THAT ONE O. K. 
NOW WE HAVE GOT A TARGET THERE A WATER MELON 
THE CHANCES OF MY HITTING IT ARE ALMOST ZERO POINT STRAIGHT AT IT 
YEAH AND GO SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT 
O. K. I RECKON ABOUT THERE 
ONE TWO THREE GO 
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER GO 
OH ONE MORE 
WOW HEY I DID IT YOU DID IT I DID IT YOU DID IT WELL DONE GOOD SHOT 
WHEN YOU SHOOT AN ARROW FROM A BOW YOU RELY ON THE ENERGY PUT INTO THE BENDING OF THE BOW 
BUT THE GREEKS TOOK A WHOLE STEP FORWARD AND INVENTED A NEW SORT OF WEAPON THE TORSION WEAPON 
I'VE GOT A FRAME HERE WITH A TWISTED BIT OF STRING IN THE MIDDLE AND A PIECE OF WOOD THROUGH IT 
AND IF I PULL THIS ROUND AND THEN LET GO IT SNAPS BACK BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY IN THIS TWISTED STRING 
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS HUGE MACHINE 
THIS IS A BALLISTA INVENTED BY THE GREEKS MODIFIED BY THE ROMANS AND WE'VE GOT TWISTY ROPES HERE 
THE ROPE GOES UP AND DOWN AND THEN IT'S TWISTED AND THIS ARM IS PUSHED AGAINST THE TWIST OF THE ROPES 
IT'S THE SAME WITH THAT ARM WHEN YOU PULL THIS BACK YOU'RE PULLING AGAINST THAT TWIST 
SIMON AND TIM CAN YOU COME IN AND WIND IT BACK FOR ME 
IT TAKES TWO WITH THIS GREAT WINCH MECHANISM TO PULL THE STRING BACK 
THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY IN THOSE TWISTED ROPES 
OUT THERE WE'VE GOT THE ENTIRE ROMAN FLEET ATTACKING SYRACUSE AND WE'RE GOING TO BOMBARD IT WITH 
WE'RE FIRING ONIONS TODAY THAT SHOULD WORRY THEM A BIT 
O. K. READY THREE TWO ONE FIRE 
DEAD ON THE LINE JUST OVER THE TOP YOU NEED TO LOWER A BIT OR GO LESS HARD 
YOU'VE GOT TO UNWIND IN ORDER TO GET THE SLIDER FORWARD 
THEN THE MECHANISM YOU LOCK THAT DOWN SO THAT THE RING CAN'T SLIP 
LOOK YOU CAN SEE THE ROPE'S BEEN TWISTED A BIT MORE BUT THAT TAKES TREMENDOUS ENERGY TO DO IT 
AND THE RATCHET MEANS IT DOESN'T LEAN FORWARD AGAIN YES 
SO YOU'RE GOING TO FIRE LESS POWERFULLY THIS TIME 
ONE NOTCH LESS O. K. IN WITH ANOTHER ONION 
THREE TWO ONE FIRE 
OH A BIT SHORT OH DEAR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN 
SHOOT 
SHOOT 
SHOOT 
SHOOT 
ONE MORE SHOT O. K. 
THIS IS IT GO TO IT 
IT'S POSSIBLE YOU'RE USING THE WRONG SORT OF ONIONS THEY COULD'VE BEEN SABOTAGED BY THE ENEMY YES 
AND THERE IS A BIT OF WIND A VERY SLIGHT DISADVANTAGE 
SORRY ABOUT THAT IT'S THE ONIONS 
O. K. LOAD UP 
LAST CHANCE THREE TWO ONE FIRE 
HEY YEAH HEY I HAVE TO SAY I'M IMPRESSED 
YOU WERE DELIBERATELY MISSING TO BUILD TENSION ALTHOUGH IT'S A TORSION WEAPON 
ANYWAY FANTASTIC YOU DO NEED A LOT OF ONIONS 
BUT IN THE END YOU CAN SINK THE ROMAN FLEET 
THE ROMANS EVENTUALLY OVERPOWERED SYRACUSE AND POOR OLD ARCHIMEDES 
WAS KILLED DURING THE SACK OF THE CITY 
THIS WAS A GREAT LOSS 
AS HIS FERTILE MIND HAD PRODUCED MANY IDEAS OF TRUE GENIUS 
HE'S MY SUPER HERO 
PROBABLY THE GREATEST MATHEMATICIAN OF THE ANCIENT WORLD 
FOR THE ROMANS THE SPOILS OF VICTORY MEANT ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY 
THAT HAD MADE THE GREEKS A POWERFUL MILITARY FORCE 
BECAUSE THE GREEKS KEPT WAGING WARS FROM THE ROMANS IN THE WEST 
TO THE PERSIANS IN THE EAST 
THEY NEEDED SECURE COMMUNICATIONS AND CAME UP WITH INGENIOUS SYSTEMS 
MARTY'S MADE ONE OF THEIR DEVICES FOR SENDING MESSAGES 
BASED ON A SURPRISINGLY BASIC IDEA 
THIS IS BASED ON THE GREEK DESIGN AND IT'S A BOTTLE HERE WITH WATER IN IT 
YOU CAN SEE WATER DRIBBLING OUT I'VE NOT SEALED IT PERFECTLY WITH A BUNG AT THE BOTTOM O. K. 
THEN WE'VE GOT A FLOAT IN THIS BIG ORANGE THING 
AND A STICK ATTACHED TO IT ON THE STICK ARE MARKS 
EACH ONE CORRESPONDS TO A MESSAGE A PRE ARRANGED MESSAGE 
YES SO THE FIRST MARK IS SEND REINFORCEMENTS THE SECOND RETREAT 
AND THE THIRD IS I DON'T KNOW TIME FOR LUNCH OR SOMETHING 
TO SEND A MESSAGE YOU UN BUNG THE CORK THE WATER DRIBBLES OUT 
WHEN IT GETS THE MESSAGE YOU WANT LET'S SAY I WANNA SEND THAT MESSAGE 
YOU STOP IT AND I'VE SENT THE MESSAGE 
ER BUT IF I'M ON A HILL TWO MILES AWAY I CAN'T EVEN SEE THE BOTTLE 
NO YOU SEE THAT'S THE CLEVER BIT WE HAVE TWO IDENTICAL BOTTLES 
YOU HAVE ONE AND I HAVE ONE YOU GO TWO MILES AWAY ALL I DO IS SIGNAL 
WAVE USING A BURNING TORCH OR SOMETHING SO YOU PULL THE CORK OUT EXACTLY WHEN I PULL MINE OUT 
SIMUL CORKERY INDEED YES 
I SIGNAL TO YOU AGAIN TO PUT THE BUNG IN BECAUSE THE BOTTLES ARE IDENTICAL 
WE BOTH GET TO THE SAME SIGNAL ON OUR STICK AND I'VE SENT THE SIGNAL 
THAT'S CUNNING NOW THERE IS A SLIGHT DRAWBACK THE GREEKS DID NOT HAVE PLASTIC BOTTLES 
LET'S MAKE A GENUINE MODEL AND TEST IT 
MARTY'S BUILT ME A REAL ONE HERE A LOVELY AMPHORA FULL OF WATER 
WITH A FLOAT HERE AND A CORK 
I CAN SEND HIM A MESSAGE HE'S ON THE TOWER BY PULLING OUT THIS BUNG 
LETTING THE WATER RUN OUT 
UNTIL WE REACH WHICHEVER OF THESE PREARRANGED MESSAGES WE WANT 
FIRST I NEED TO MAKE SURE MARTY IS UP AND RUNNING 
NOW MARTY ARE YOU THERE O. K. SO WHEN I DROP MY ARM I'M GONNA PULL OUT THE CORK 
THREE TWO ONE GO PULL OUT THE BUNG 
AND NOW YOU SEE IT'S DROPPING HERE WE'VE GOT ALPHA BETA GAMMA DELTA 
I DON'T WANT TO SAY SEND REINFORCEMENTS 
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO SEND TIME FOR LUNCH I'M A BIT THIRSTY 
I'LL SEND ZETA SO I'LL GET READY TO STOP ONE TWO THREE STOP 
BUNG IN THE BUNG AH GOOD 
SIGNALLING WITH AN AMPHORA WAS VERY EFFICIENT BUT ALSO RATHER LIMITED 
YOU COULD ONLY PUT TEN PRE ARRANGED MESSAGES ON YOUR LIST 
SUPPOSE THE ENEMY SURPRISED US AND ATTACKED ON CAMELS 
THERE'S NO WAY I COULD SIGNAL THAT THERE'S NO CAMEL ON MY LIST 
IN THE SECOND CENTURY B. C. THE HISTORIAN POLYBIUS RECORDED 
A MORE FLEXIBLE SYSTEM WHEREBY THEY COULD SEND LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET 
OBVIOUSLY WITH LETTERS YOU CAN SPELL ANY WORD IT WORKED LIKE THIS 
HERE ARE THE LETTERS OF THE GREEK ALPHABET ON TABLETS FIVE TABLETS 
ALL THE WAY FROM ALPHA TO OMEGA 
TO SEND A PARTICULAR LETTER THEY USED A FLAG A SYSTEM OF FLAGS 
SUPPOSE I WANT TO SEND BETA HERE 
THIS IS IN TABLET NUMBER ONE SO I HAVE ONE FLAG IN MY LEFT HAND 
IT'S THE SECOND LETTER DOWN SO I HAVE TWO FLAGS IN MY RIGHT HAND 
NOW I'M READY TO SIGNAL BETA TO THE WORLD SO ONE TWO THREE BETA 
HERMIONE BETA 
OH BACK TO ATHENS 
ADAM WANTS ME TO INVESTIGATE HOW THE ANCIENT GREEKS ESTABLISHED DEMOCRACY IN THEIR CITIES 
THE DAY I ARRIVED IN ATHENS THE CITY WAS IN A STATE OF EXCITEMENT 
IT WAS THE WEEK OF NATIONAL ELECTIONS AND PASSIONS WERE RUNNING HIGH 
DEMOCRACY BEGAN HERE IN 
WHEN REFORMS GAVE THE COMMON MAN A SAY IN THE RUNNING OF THE CITY 
IT'S A SYSTEM THAT HAS CHANGED THE COURSE OF HISTORY BUT IT WASN'T DEMOCRACY AS WE KNOW IT 
IT DIDN'T TAKE PLACE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS LIKE TODAY 
IT HAPPENED RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITY 
IT WAS AT THE VERY HEART OF PUBLIC LIFE 
IT TOOK PLACE ON A MAMMOTH SCALE OUT OF THIRTY THOUSAND ODD ELIGIBLE VOTERS 
FIVE THOUSAND REGULARLY ATTENDED THE POPULAR ASSEMBLY 
JURIES COULD BE ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE 
SURELY THERE WAS BRIBERY SLEAZE AND CORRUPTION LIKE TODAY 
WITH SO MANY PEOPLE IN A JURY IT MUST HAVE BEEN CHAOS 
TO TRY AND GET ROUND THIS POSSIBLE CORRUPTION THE GREEKS WITH THEIR GREAT INGENUITY INVENTED A MACHINE 
THE KLEROTERION 
THIS IS MARTY'S INTERPRETATION OF WHAT IT MAY HAVE LOOKED LIKE 
IT MAY EVEN BE THAT THE GREAT ARISTOTLE WROTE ABOUT THIS 
THERE'S A STONE TOP WITH A LOT OF SLOTS AND IT'S ON A STONE PLINTH 
NOW SUPPOSE YOU CAME IN AND VOLUNTEERED FOR JURY SERVICE 
YOU TOOK YOUR IDENTITY TAG THIS IS MINE IT SAYS ADAM 
YOU PUT IT IN A SLOT HERE 
ALL THE MEMBERS OF ONE GROUP THIS IS MARTY'S 
WOULD PUT THEIR IDENTITY TAGS IN THE SAME COLUMN 
ATHENS YOU SEE WAS DIVIDED INTO TEN GROUPS THAT'S HERMIONE 
IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THE SAME GROUP WOULD WANT TO VOTE THE SAME WAY 
SO THEY ALL PUT THEIR TAGS IN ONE COLUMN 
THE SECOND GROUP THAT CAME ALONG PUT THEIR TAGS IN THE SECOND COLUMN 
THE THIRD GROUP IN THE THIRD COLUMN AND SO ON AND SO FORTH 
THEN THEY SELECTED THE JURORS HORIZONTALLY CUTTING ACROSS GROUPS 
THEY DID THAT WITH BALLS 
I'VE GOT AN AMPHORA WITH BLACK AND WHITE BALLS IN IT 
I PUT THEM IN AND SHAKE THEM UP SO I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ORDER THEY'RE IN 
THEN I TIP THEM INTO THIS HOPPER ON TOP OF THE MACHINE 
AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT ORDER THEY'RE IN AND THAT'S EMPTY NOW 
PUT THAT DOWN MAKE SURE THEY'RE ALL IN 
I CAN'T SEE I HAVE NO ORDER NO IDEA OF THE ORDER OF THE BALLS 
THE FIRST BALL THAT COMES OUT THE BOTTOM WILL DECIDE WHETHER THIS TOP ROW DOES JURY SERVICE 
SO PULL OUT THE PEG A WHITE BALL 
I AND ALL THESE PEOPLE DO JURY SERVICE WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE I GET PAID FOR IT 
THE SECOND ONE IS BLACK 
THAT'S MARTY HE'S OUT HE CAN GO TO THE BEACH BUT HE DOESN'T GET PAID 
THE THIRD BALL HERE IS WHITE AND THAT MEANS THAT THE THIRD ROW 
IS DOING JURY SERVICE THAT INCLUDES HERMIONE 
AH NO SHE ISN'T BECAUSE WOMEN DIDN'T GET ANY RIGHTS 
SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ON A JURY IN FACT SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE A TAG 
BY WORKING THROUGH THE ROWS 
THE GREEKS COULD SELECT THEIR HUGE NUMBERS OF JURORS 
BY CUTTING ACROSS THE GROUPS 
WE GREATLY REDUCE THE POSSIBILITIES OF CORRUPTION 
THE GREEK WORD FOR CITY IS POLIS 
FROM WHICH WE GET OUR MODERN WORD POLITICS 
THE GREEK IDEA OF POLITICS WAS MUCH WIDER THAN OUR OWN 
IT'S NOT SURPRISING TO DISCOVER THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST CELEBRATIONS 
OF THE POLITICAL LIFE OF THE CITY WAS IN ITS THEATRE 
THE GREEKS TAUGHT US EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT DRAMA 
AND BUILT AMAZING PLACES TO STAGE IT 
PUBLIC THEATRES WERE INVENTED BY THE GREEKS AND HELD A LOT OF THE PUBLIC 
THIS ONE AT EPIDAVROS SEATS UP TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE 
ALTHOUGH IT'S MASSIVE THE ACOUSTICS ARE SO SOPHISTICATED 
THAT EVEN FROM WHERE I AM ABOUT FORTY METRES FROM THE STAGE 
YOU CAN STILL HEAR EVERY NOISE EVEN THE STRIKING OF A MATCH 
NOT ONLY COULD YOU HEAR EVERYTHING 
BUT EVERY SEAT IN THE HOUSE HAD AN UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW OF THE STAGE 
FROM THE BACK ROW THE ACTORS ONLY APPEARED A FEW CENTIMETRES HIGH 
THE AUDIENCE COULD STILL UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON 
THEY INVENTED MASKS AND COSTUMES SO THE AUDIENCE COULD TELL WHO WAS WHO 
MASKS USED IN COMEDY AND TRAGEDY WERE QUITE DIFFERENT 
THOSE USED IN COMEDY WERE UGLY AND DELIBERATELY DISTORTED 
AND USED FOR POLITICAL SATIRE JUST LIKE SPITTING IMAGE 
WHAT ABOUT SCENERY OF COURSE IT WAS AN ANCIENT GREEK INVENTION 
THEY ALSO HAD THE MECHANE A TYPE OF CRANE USED FOR THE ENTRANCE OF GODS 
EVEN IN THIS MODERN THEATRE IN ATHENS 
THE TYPES OF DEVICES USED IN ANCIENT GREEK DRAMA CAN STILL BE SEEN 
THEY ALSO INVENTED THE REVOLVING STAGE 
SO THE GREEKS GAVE US THEATRES ACOUSTICS COSTUMES 
SCENERY AND SPECIAL EFFECTS BUT THAT'S STILL NOT IT 
THE ANCIENT GREEKS WERE ONE OF THE FIRST TO ALLOW ACTORS ALWAYS MEN 
TO SPEAK AND PLAY INDIVIDUAL PARTS 
AS SOON AS THEY HAD ONE CHARACTER THEY REALISED INTRODUCING A SECOND 
AND A THIRD WOULD MAKE THE STORY A LOT MORE DRAMATIC 
WITH THREE ACTORS YOU HAVE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES 
BOY MEETS GIRL BOY LOSES GIRL BOY TAKES REVENGE FOR LOSING GIRL 
WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED 
THE GREEK CONCEPT OF TRAGEDY WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE SORT OF HUMAN DRAMA 
WE WATCH ON OUR T. V.'S ALL THE TIME BUT EARLY GREEK THEATRE DIDN'T JUST RELY ON ACTORS FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT 
THEY EVEN PRODUCED THE FIRST EVER SELF PROPELLED MACHINES OR ROBOTS 
THIS IS A RECONSTRUCTION OF ONE OF THE MINIATURE THEATRES 
THAT MOVED ABOUT ALL BY THEMSELVES 
IN FACT THEY'RE ALL PROPELLED BY HIDDEN MOVING WEIGHTS 
AND THEY WERE DESIGNED BY A CHAP CALLED HERON HERON OF ALEXANDRIA 
I'VE CHALLENGED MARTY TO MAKE ME ONE 
THIS IS THE DRIVING FORCE A LARGE WEIGHT THIRTY KILOS WOW 
AND THEN THIS BIT HERE THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF CHICKEN GRAIN HERE 
YOU GOT CHICKENS IN HERE NO JUST THE FEED 
WHEN I PULL THIS WOOD OUT OPEN A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM FEED POURS OUT 
AND THE WEIGHT DROPS SLOWLY AS IT DROPS IT PULLS THESE STRINGS UP 
AND THOSE STRINGS ARE ATTACHED HERE 
TO THESE AXLES OBVIOUSLY AS THEY UNWIND IT DRIVES IT FORWARD 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'LL WORK GO ON THEN 
IT'S NOT MOVING GIVE IT A CHANCE 
GIVE IT A CHANCE HERE IT GOES OH HEY AND HERE IT GOES 
IT DOES GO QUITE WELL 
IT JUST SORT OF TRUNDLES ALONG QUITE SLOWLY NOW OBVIOUSLY 
THIS DROP CONTROLS HOW FAR WE CAN GO SO IT HAS SO IT'S GONNA RUN OUT 
IT'S GONNA RUN OUT ABOUT THERE I PREDICT 
IT GOES STRAIGHT YOU CLAIM IT'S PROGRAMMABLE YES CAN YOU MAKE IT DO A SLALOM 
WE CAN GIVE IT A GO O. K. SO IF YOU RESET IT I WILL CHALLENGE YOU 
SOME EXPERTS THINK HERON HOPED TO SCALE UP HIS ROBOT TO A SIEGE TOWER 
FOR ATTACKING ENEMY CITIES 
IN FACT IT NEVER GOT FURTHER THAN A TABLE TOP MODEL 
SO WHAT DO YOU RECKON THIS WILL DO 
IT'S GONNA STEER ROUND THIS PILLAR I'LL PUT THE PILLAR ABOUT THERE 
HANG ON ONE PILLAR DOTH NOT A SLALOM MAKE HOW WILL IT GET ROUND 
WELL IT'S GONNA STEER FORTY FIVE DEGREES THIS WAY ALONG HERE A BIT 
FORTY FIVE DEGREES THEN CARRY ON STRAIGHT 
DOWN THERE DOWN THERE YOU SAY 
I'M GOING TO MAKE IT MORE OF A CHALLENGE ONE THERE AND THERE 
I WANT IT TO STOP BETWEEN THOSE TWO WE'LL TRY LOOK AT THE GUBBINS THE CLEVER BIT 
RATHER THAN JUST WRAPPING IT ROUND THE SPINDLES WE'VE ZIGZAGGED IT 
BETWEEN THESE PEGS WITH THIS ONE FIRST AT LEAST AS IT MOVES 
IT'LL POP OFF THE PEGS AND CREATE EFFECTIVELY SLACK IT WON'T WORK 
EXACTLY THIS WHEEL WILL STOP TURNING BUT THAT ONE WILL CONTINUE 
OH AND PULL IT ROUND THAT'S WHY THERE'S SEPARATELY DRIVING WHEELS THIS ONE WILL STEER IT BACK STRAIGHT 
IT'S LIKE HAVING A LOOP OF SLACK EXACTLY STILL CAN'T SEE IT WORKING 
SHALL WE GIVE IT A TRY YES ONE TWO THREE 
IT'S NOT GOING AT ALL IT ALWAYS TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF A START 
NO IT'S NOT HERE IT GOES SEE 
OH IT'S COME OFF THE PEGS I AGREE STEER STEER STEER 
OH IT'S CLOSE IT'S GONNA BE A VERY YOU MISSED YOUR FIRST BASE 
SO IT COMES ALONG IT'S GONNA RUN INTO THIS ONE 
WELL ITS STEERING AROUND IT 
I SAID SO MARTY I SAID IT WOULDN'T WORK IT DID IT DEFINITELY WENT ROUND THE CORNER 
HERON WAS A PROLIFIC INVENTOR WHO WORKED ON ORGANS 
PUMPS AND SURVEYING TOOLS AND EVEN INVENTED THE FIRST STEAM ENGINE 
THERE'S A HEATER IN THE BOTTOM A BOILER HERE WE'RE GONNA MAKE STEAM 
IT'LL COME UP THIS STALK INTO THIS BARREL I HOPE JET OUT OF THE JETS 
AND THE THING WILL SPIN ROUND LET'S SEE IF IT'S GONNA WORK 
GIVE IT A BIT OF WELLY 
I'M GONNA STAND WELL BACK 
COS I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF STEAM FROM THIS 
WOW LOOK AT THAT FANTASTIC IT'S GOING ROUND WITH GREAT SPEED 
THIS WAS JUST A TABLE TOP TOY IT'S BEEN CALCULATED THAT IF IT WAS BIG ENOUGH TO DO THE WORK OF ONE MAN 
IT WOULD TAKE FOUR BLOKES SHOVELLING THE COAL TO KEEP IT RUNNING 
BUT IT WAS THE FIRST MACHINE EVER TO TURN HEAT INTO USEFUL WORK 
THE PRIESTS REALLY LOVED THESE TOYS 
THEY HAD A NATURAL HOME IN TEMPLES BECAUSE THEY IMPRESSED WORSHIPPERS 
AND IT WOULD REINFORCE THE PRIESTS' CLAIMS TO BE CONDUITS TO THE GODS 
HERON'S GADGETS WERE AMAZING BUT ONE ONE OF MY FAVOURITES 
WHICH WE JUST TAKE FOR GRANTED MAKES OUR LIVES MUCH EASIER 
JUST LOOK AT THESE TEMPLE DOORS 
THEY WERE ARRANGED TO OPEN BY MAGIC ALL ON THEIR OWN 
WHAT HERON HAD INVENTED WERE THE FIRST AUTOMATIC DOORS 
AND MARTY HAS WORKED OUT HOW THEY WOULD HAVE WORKED 
THIS IS THE SACRED ALTAR YES THE KEY THING HERE IS THIS 
THIS ISN'T JUST A DECORATIVE ROOF 
THIS IS ACTUALLY A HOLLOW METAL CHAMBER FULL OF AIR OBVIOUSLY 
WE'VE LIT THE FIRE UNDERNEATH 
A SUITABLE INSTANT FLAME AND AS THIS GETS HOT IT'LL HEAT THE AIR 
THE AIR WILL EXPAND IT'S PUSHED DOWN A PIPE CONCEALED CUNNINGLY 
IN ONE OF THE COLUMNS IT COMES DOWN THIS TUBE INTO THIS SEALED VESSEL 
AH SEALED AT THE TOP EXACTLY 
THE AIR CAN'T GET OUT 
AS IT PUSHES DOWN ON THE WATER WATER IS PUSHED OUT 
AND ALONG THIS PIPE WE NEED TO SHIFT ALL THE WATER TO OPEN THE DOORS 
SO IT COMES ALONG THIS PIPE ALONG HERE 
UP HERE AND INTO HERE EVENTUALLY 
IT'S NOT QUITE STARTED YET 
BUT EVENTUALLY IT'LL TRICKLE OUT THE BOTTOM 
THE WEIGHT FILLS WITH WATER SLOWLY IT GETS HEAVIER AND WILL OVERCOME THE COUNTERBALANCE WEIGHT THERE 
AS IT PULLS DOWN THE PULLEYS TURN AND THE DOORS SHOULD MAGICALLY OPEN 
CAN I TRY YOU CAN ALTHOUGH JUST A BIT BECAUSE THERE'S NO CHEATING 
AND THE DOORS OPEN FANTASTIC 
ONCE THE FAR JUG HAS FILLED UP AND BECOMES HEAVIER THE IDEA IS 
THAT IT SINKS DOWN THE OTHER JUG RISES AND THE DOORS OPEN 
VIA A PULLEY SYSTEM WILL IT WORK 
O. K. SO WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT WHILE IT HEATS UP A BIT MORE LET'S SEE WHAT THE WATER'S DOING 
CLOSE GETTING THERE VERY NEAR 
OH YEAH THERE IT GOES 
NOT BAD SMOOTH AS OILED SILK YES 
PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY TEMPLE DOORS HAVE OPENED AUTOMATICALLY 
I'M DELIGHTED HERON WAS SPONSORED BY THE LOCAL PRIESTS 
BECAUSE THEY HAD LOADS OF MONEY 
AND WITHOUT THAT WE MIGHT NEVER HAVE HAD ALL THOSE FABULOUS INVENTIONS 
BUT HI TECH STAGE CRAFT WASN'T THE ONLY CEREMONIAL ELEMENT 
THE GREEK RELIGION WAS PACKED WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY ARRAY OF RITUALS 
THEY WOULD STUDY THE ENTRAILS OF SACRIFICED ANIMALS 
THEY WOULD LOOK AT THE PATTERNS OF FALLEN OAK LEAVES 
AND AT DELPHI ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THE GREEK TEMPLES 
THEY HAD THEIR OWN SPECIAL WAY OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE GODS 
THE GREEKS DEDICATED THEIR MOST FAMOUS TEMPLE AT DELPHI TO THEIR GOD APOLLO 
IT WAS HOME TO THE ORACLE A FEMALE PRIEST CALLED A PYTHIA 
WHEN SHE SPOKE IT WAS BELIEVED SHE WAS UTTERING THE WORDS OF APOLLO 
THOUSANDS JOURNEYED HERE EACH YEAR 
THEY CAME FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE KINGS DOWN TO PEASANTS 
POLITICIANS SOLDIERS PHILOSOPHERS PEACE TREATIES BETWEEN WARRING STATES 
WOULD OFTEN INCLUDE A CLAUSE GIVING FREE ACCESS TO THE ORACLE 
ON ADVICE THE ORACLE GAVE COMMANDERS DECIDED WHETHER TO GO TO WAR 
BUT ALSO HUNDREDS OF ORDINARY PEOPLE WOULD DECIDE WHO TO MARRY 
OR WHEN TO HAVE CHILDREN 
AFTER SOME RITUALS AND SACRIFICES THE PYTHIA WOULD ENTER 
INTO AN INNER SANCTUM WHERE SHE SAT ASTRIDE A TRIPOD 
AND TALKED IN A COMPLETELY MYSTERIOUS AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE LANGUAGE 
ONLY THE PRIESTS COULD INTERPRET 
THIS LED TO SOME CATASTROPHIC MISUNDERSTANDINGS 
FAMOUSLY BY THE LYDIAN KING CROESUS 
IF YOU ATTACK THE PERSIANS HE WAS TOLD YOU'LL DESTROY A GREAT EMPIRE 
WELL HE DID BUT IT WAS HIS OWN 
THE QUESTION IS WAS THE ORACLE JUST A SHAM 
WAS THE PYTHIA NOTHING MORE THAN AN ACTRESS IN LEAGUE WITH THE PRIESTS 
THERE WAS A FEE INVOLVED WITH EVERY CONSULTATION WELL I'M NOT SO SURE 
A FORMER PRIEST OF THE TEMPLE WROTE THAT BEFORE GOING INTO A TRANCE 
THE PYTHIA DRANK FROM THE SPRING AND INHALED VAPOURS FROM DEEP WITHIN THE EARTH 
GREECE IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST ACTIVELY SEISMIC AREAS AND IT'S INCREDIBLY PRONE TO EARTHQUAKES 
IN DELPHI WE'RE ACTUALLY SITTING ON TOP OF TWO CRISS CROSSING FAULTS 
SCIENTISTS HAVE RECENTLY SHOWN 
ONE OF THESE FAULTS PASSES DIRECTLY BENEATH THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO 
RIGHT THROUGH THAT INNER SANCTUM WHERE THE PYTHIA WAS THOUGHT TO SIT 
THESE FAULTS SOMETIMES PRODUCE INTOXICATING GASES 
AND THAT'S JUST WHAT THE PYTHIA WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO SEE INTO THE FUTURE 
RECENT SURVEYS OF THIS SPRING WHERE THE ORACLE DRANK 
HAVE FOUND VARIOUS GASSES AND INTRIGUINGLY ONE IS ETHYLENE 
IN LARGE DOSES ETHYLENE CAN INDUCE EUPHORIA EVEN DELIRIUM 
I THINK THERE'S A STRONG CHANCE THE ORACLE WASN'T UTTERING APOLLO'S WORDS AT ALL 
A DIFFERENT SPIRIT WAS GETTING TO HER 
WHATEVER IT WAS THAT INDUCED THE PYTHIA INTO HER SPIRITUAL TRANCES 
IT'S WITHOUT QUESTION THE GODS WERE VERY IMPORTANT TO ANCIENT GREEKS 
AS WAS THE PLACE THEY LIVED THE HEAVENS 
THE GREEKS NAMED PLANETS AFTER THEIR GODS ARIES WE CALL HIM MARS THE GOD OF WAR 
APHRODITE WE CALL HER VENUS THE GODDESS OF LOVE 
AND HERMES THE MESSENGER TO THE GODS 
OVER TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO GREEK SCIENTISTS STARTED DEVELOPING 
SOME IMPORTANT ASTRONOMICAL IDEAS 
PYTHAGORAS ARGUED THAT THE EARTH WAS ROUND AND HE REALISED 
THAT THE MORNING AND THE EVENING STAR WERE THE SAME PLANET VENUS 
IN ABOUT ARISTARCHUS KNEW THAT THE THEN KNOWN FIVE PLANETS 
REVOLVED AROUND THE SUN NOT AROUND THE EARTH 
A FEW YEARS LATER 
ERATOSTHENES MEASURED THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE EARTH 
AND GOT THE EQUIVALENT OF FORTY THOUSAND KILOMETRES HE WAS SPOT ON 
THERE WERE GOOD REASONS WHY THE ANCIENTS WANTED TO UNDERSTAND 
THE MOVEMENT OF THE SUN AND STARS 
IT WAS ALL ABOUT TIMEKEEPING 
WHAT WAS THE BEST TIME TO PLANT TO PRUNE TO HARVEST 
THAT COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH 
BUT THEY WERE ALSO FASCINATED BY THE WEIRD WANDERINGS OF THE PLANETS 
MY FAVOURITE PIECE OF GREEK BRILLIANCE 
IS ALL TO DO WITH PREDICTING THE PEREGRINATIONS OF THE PLANETS 
OF ALL GREEK INVENTIONS ONE HAS PERPLEXED THE EXPERTS 
SINCE IT WAS DISCOVERED OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO BY SOME SPONGE DIVERS 
DRIVEN OFF COURSE BY A STORM 
THEY FOUND A HUGE UNKNOWN WRECK NEAR THE ISLAND OF ANTIKYTHERA 
DURING EIGHT MONTHS OF DIVING AND EXCAVATION 
TINY BRONZE FRAGMENTS WERE FOUND AND COMPLEX MINIATURE GEAR WHEELS 
ASTONISHINGLY IT SEEMED AS IF AN ANCIENT COMPUTER HAD BEEN UNEARTHED 
A HUGE ROW BROKE OUT EXACTLY WHAT WAS THIS ANTIKYTHERAN MACHINE 
ONE MAN BELIEVES HE HAS THE ANSWER 
MICHAEL WRIGHT HAS WORKED ON ANCIENT MECHANISMS FOR TWENTY YEARS 
AND PROBABLY KNOWS MORE ABOUT THEM THAN ANYONE ELSE 
MICHAEL WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
I'VE JUST FINISHED MAKING A LITTLE GEAR WHEEL WITH NINETY SIX TEETH 
NINETY SIX TEETH WOW 
THAT IS AMAZING BEAUTIFUL THING 
IS THIS YOUR VERSION OF THE ANTIKYTHERA MECHANISM 
THIS IS MY RECONSTRUCTION OF 
AT THE MOMENT THE FRONT HALF OF THE MECHANISM 
THE BITS I'M MAKING ARE FOR THE BACK THAT I'VE NOW WORKED OUT IT'S AMAZINGLY COMPLICATED 
YES SO EXPLAIN IT TO ME 
MY IDEA IS THAT THE ANTIKYTHERAN MECHANISM WAS A PLANETARIUM 
IT SHOWED THE POSITIONS OF THE SUN 
MOON AND THE FIVE KNOWN PLANETS IN THE ZODIAC 
UM WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THE BOX HERE 
UM WE'VE GOT THIS PART 
THAT GOES ROUND 
ONE TURN FOR A YEAR 
THREE LITTLE EPICYCLES SITTING ON IT 
THAT'S FOR THE SUN THAT'S FOR MERCURY THAT'S FOR VENUS OH WOW 
WE CAN SEND THEM ROUND LIKE THAT 
OH I SEE THAT IS FASCINATING 
THESE LEVERS ARE PICKING UP THE MOTION OF THE EPICYCLES 
AND THEY'LL TRANSMIT IT THROUGH THE HANDS WHICH WE'LL PUT ON UP TO THE DIAL ON TOP 
I'M RUNNING IT BACKWARDS NOW READY TO PUT TOGETHER 
IT'S ALREADY COMPLICATED 
IT'S COMPLICATED ENOUGH BUT THAT IS 
BASED VERY CLOSELY ON WHAT WE FIND IN THE ORIGINAL BIT 
THE REST HAS COME OUT OF MY HEAD 
BECAUSE I SAY ANYONE WHO'D GONE TO THE TROUBLE OF THIS MUCH COMPLICATION 
TO SHOW THE SUN MOON MERCURY AND VENUS WOULD WANT THE OTHERS TOO 
THE ANTIKYTHERA MECHANISM IS UNIQUE 
NO OTHER MACHINE OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS COMPLEXITY 
HAS EVER BEEN FOUND FROM THE ANCIENT WORLD 
BUT NOW WITH ALL THE PIECES CAREFULLY IN PLACE 
IT'S TIME FOR THE MOMENT OF TRUTH 
FROM A TOWER MICHAEL WILL CHECK HIS MACHINE 
AGAINST THE POSITION OF VENUS IN THE MORNING SKY WILL HE GET IT RIGHT 
FANTASTIC VIEW 
IT WAS ONLY FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THREE STEPS 
RIGHT MICHAEL WE CAN SEE THE SUN 
OH BEAUTIFUL MECHANISM SO WHAT DO YOU RECKON THE ANGLE SHOULD BE 
FOR TODAY'S DATE THIS SHARP POINTER IS THE DATE SO WE'LL GET THAT RIGHT 
THERE'S THE SUN BEHIND IT 
VENUS ROUND HERE THE ANGLE BETWEEN THEM IS FORTY TWO DEGREES 
YOU CLAIM I CLAIM LET'S SEE 
SO THIS INSTRUMENT'S A DIOPTRE WHICH MEANS A THING TO LOOK THROUGH 
IT'S GOT TWO SIGHTING TUBES ONE FOR POINTING AT THE SUN 
I WON'T LOOK THROUGH IT AT THE SUN IT'S TOO BRIGHT WE'LL CAST A POOL OF LIGHT THROUGH IT 
A SHADE MORE DOWN TOWARDS ME THERE STOP 
THAT'S THE SUN WE MUST MOVE QUITE FAST BECAUSE THE SUN IS MOVING 
WE KNOW WE WANT TO FIND VENUS AT ABOUT FORTY TWO DEGREES YOU CLAIM 
I CLAIM THAT'S THE ANGLE AH THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE TUBES GOT YOU 
WE HAVE TO TILT THIS TO GET THE ELEVATION RIGHT 
I HAVE TO LOOK FOR VENUS I'M ON VENUS NOW RIGHT AND THE ANGLE IS 
FORTY THREE DEGREES 
THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING SO CLOSE 
THIS MACHINE WAS CONSTRUCTED ORIGINALLY IN 
THAT'S WHEN IT WAS LOST IN THE SHIPWRECK RIGHT SO EARLIER 
A LITTLE EARLIER AMAZING THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY INCREDIBLY INGENIOUS 
WITH THEIR HANDS AS WELL AS BRAINS 
THIS ONE OBJECT SHOWS US THEY WERE INTERESTED IN GADGETS 
LIKED HAVING THEM QUITE CAPABLE OF MAKING THEM WHEN THEY WANTED FANTASTIC ISN'T IT 
THE GREEKS WERE EXTRAORDINARY THEY GAVE US SO MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE NOW 
THEY GAVE US THE THEATRE DEMOCRACY OUR IDEAS OF ETHICS 
THEY GAVE US MUSIC MATHEMATICS AND MOST OF ALL THEY BUILT A COMPUTER
