CYCLONE HIT BURMA THE FIRST UNITED 
NATIONS AID PLANE IS ALLOWED IN 
EMERGENCY SUPPLIES FINALLY REACH 
SOME OF THE SURVIVORS 
BUT IT IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH THERE 
IS GROWING INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE 
TO ALLOW MORE RESCUE WORKERS IN 
RIGHT NOW MORE THAN ONE MILLION HUMAN 
BEINGS ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF 
ASSISTANCE ARE NOT GET IT THAT HAS 
TO BE THE FOCUS OF EVERY MINUTE AND 
EVERY HOUR 
A RECORD FINE FOR I. T. V. MORE THAN 
FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR DECEIVING VIEWERS 
IN SUCCESS OF PHONE VOTE SCANDALS 
WHAT A WASTE BRITAIN'S THROWAWAY 
BILLIONS OF POUNDS WERE OF FOOD 
EVERY YEAR 
AND I WILL BE REPORTING LIVE FROM 
THE SIDE OF THE OLYMPIC STADIUM IN 
STRATFORD WHERE IT HAS BEEN 
REVEALED TODAY THAT THE 
CONSTRUCTION WORK WILL START IN TWO 
WEEKS' TIME 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON A MAN DIES 
AFTER A GAS EXPLOSION RIPPED 
THROUGH TWO HOUSES IN NORTH LONDON 
AND ALL CHANGE AT THE TOP AS THE 
LONDON DEVELOPMENT AGENCY BOSS 
BECOMES THE FIRST CASUALTY OF THE 
NEW ADMINISTRATION 
HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON THE FIRST 
UNITED NATIONS PLANE HAS FINALLY 
LANDED IN BURMA AS PART OF THE AID 
EFFORT TO HELP THE SURVIVORS OF THE 
CYCLONE THE COUNTRY IS UNDER 
GROWING INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO 
ALLOW MORE AID AGENCIES IN AS 
PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO FIND FOOD AND 
CLEAN WATER NEARLY TEN MILLION HAS 
BEEN PLEDGED TO HELP BURMA MAINLY 
FROM BRITAIN CHINA AND THE U. S. IN 
THE PAST FEW DAYS SUPPLIES HAVE 
ARRIVED FROM THAILAND JAPAN INDIA 
CHINA SINGAPORE AND INDONESIA BUT 
DOZENS OF AGENCIES HAVE NOT YET 
BEEN GIVEN PERMISSION TO ENTER THE 
COUNTRY THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME 
HAS THOUSANDS OF TONS OF FOOD 
WAITING IN BANGKOK DAKAR AND DUBAI 
BUT SO FAR JUST ONE PLANE HAS 
ARRIVED THREE MORE ARE DUE LATER 
TODAY THE UNITED STATES HAS ALSO 
EMERGENCY SUPPLIES ON STANDBY IT 
IS ALSO AWAITING PERMISSION TO FLY 
IN IN A MOMENT THE LATEST FROM 
INSIDE SOUTHERN BURMA BUT FIRST 
BRIAN HANRAHAN REPORTS 
LIFE IN BURMA HAS BEEN REDUCED TO 
BASICS THIS AMATEUR VIDEO FROM THE 
CYCLONE STRUCK REGION SHOWS A SPIT 
OF THAILAND WHERE TEN OF THOUSANDS 
OF DESTITUTE PEOPLE HAVE FLED WITH 
NO BELONGINGS NO SHELTER THEY 
NEED SUPPORT NOW TO SURVIVE BUT 
THERE IS AN EERIE LACK OF 
ORGANISATION A HANDFUL OF DOCTORS 
AND RED CROSS VOLUNTEERS ARE 
OVERWHELMED BURMA HAS NO CHANCE OF 
COPING WITH THIS DISASTER ALONE 
ACROSS THE BORDER IN THAILAND 
AGENCIES ARE WAITS TO BE ALLOWED IN 
SOME SUPPLIERS ARE BEING FLOWN BY 
THE THAI AIR FORCE BUT EARLIER 
REPORTS THAT U. S. PLANES WOULD BE 
PERMITTED TO HELP HAVE PROVED 
UNFOUNDED THE BURMESE JUNTA ARE 
STILL TOO HOSTILE TO AMERICA 
IF IT 
SHOULD BE A SIMPLE MATTER THIS IS 
NOT A MATTER OF POLITICS THIS IS A 
MATTER OF A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS 
AND IT SHOULD BE A MATTER THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT OF BURMA WANTS TO SEE 
ITS PEOPLE RECEIVE THE HELP THAT IS 
AVAILABLE 
BYRNE IS ACCEPTING SOME AVAILABLE FLIGHTS FROM INDIA CHINA AND 
INDONESIA AND THE FIRST UNITED 
NATIONS AIRCRAFT HAS ARRIVED BUT 
THERE ARE WORRIES ABOUT HOW MANY 
FLIGHTS RANGOON AIRPORT CAN HANDLE 
AND BURMA IS STILL REFUSING TO 
ALLOW THOSE IN TO COPE WITH THE 
EXPERTISE OF THE DISASTER THESE THESE ARE PROFESSIONAL AID WORKERS WHO 
WILL MAKE SURE THE AID GETS TO THE 
PEOPLE THEY WILL ORGANISE 
DISTRIBUTION IDENTIFY THE VICTIMS 
IN GREATEST NEED THEY WILL MAKE 
SURE THAT HELP SUPPLIES WATER 
FOOD SHELTER SUPPLIES GET TO THE 
PEOPLE WHO NEEDED WE WILL NOT THE 
WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME WILL NOT JUST 
BRING SUPPLIES INTO AN AIRPORT AND 
DUMP IT AND TAKE OFF 
THERE ARE 
FEARS THAT THIS DISASTER MAY BE 
COMPARABLE TO THE SCALE OF THE TOON 
ARMY PACKED INTO ONE OF THE 
WORLD'S POOREST AND LEAST DEVELOPED 
NATIONS BRITAIN IS URGING THE 
BURMESE TO ACCEPT ALL THE HELP IT 
CAN GET 
MUCH OF THE AFFECTED 
REGION IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE BY BOAT 
AND MANY OF THE BOATS WERE DAMAGED 
OR DESTROYED BY THE CYCLONE ITSELF 
IT IS THEREFORE VITAL THAT AID 
WORKERS GET ACCESS TO AREAS 
AFFECTED TO CO ORDINATE EMERGENCY 
RESPONSE AND DELIVER AID TO THOSE 
IN NEED WE ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING 
MIXED SIGNALS ON THE QUESTION OF 
ACCESS TO BURMA FOR INTERNATIONAL 
STAFF 
MONKS AND MUSCLE POWER ARE STAFF BEING USED TO CLEAR THE STREETS IN 
THE CAPITAL BUT WITHOUT MORE 
MODERN COMMUNICATIONS HELP WILL 
NEVER REACH THOSE MOST AT RISK 
SIX DAYS AFTER THE CYCLONE SLAMMED 
INTO THIS COUNTRY IT IS STILL NOT 
CLEAR JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE 
DIED ALMOST ONE MILLION SURVIVORS 
ARE CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
STRANDED BY BROKEN BRIDGES BLOCKED 
ROADS AND A GOVERNMENT RELUCTANCE 
TO ALLOW IN INTERNATIONAL AID BUT 
ALL THE SIGNS ARE BAD SOME 
ESTIMATES SAY UP TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED THAT MEANS 
THAT THOSE STILL ALIVE ARE 
SURROUNDED BY THE DEAD AND THE RISK 
OF DISEASE THE SURVIVORS HAVE NO 
FOOD NO SHELTER AND INCREASINGLY 
THEY MUST BE LOSING HOPE THE 
GOVERNMENT IS DRAGGING ITS FEET 
WRANGLING OVER VISAS AND 
COMMISSIONS WHILE SOME AID IS 
TRICKLING INTO THE COUNTRY MUCH 
MORE IS LYING IDLE ON ITS BORDERS 
IN A COUNTRY GOVERNED BY A MILITARY 
OBSESSED WITH CONTROL THIS CYCLONE 
COULD NOT HAVE IT AT A WORSE TIME 
THIS WEEKEND THERE IS TO BE A 
REFERENDUM ON A NEW CONSTITUTION 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS 
ALREADY CONDEMNED IT AS A SHAM THE 
GENERALS WHO HAVE BEEN ON STATE T. V. 
SHOWING THEMSELVES INVOLVED IN THE 
RELIEF EFFORT MAY BE WORRIED THAT 
LETTING IN FOREIGNERS AHEAD OF THAT 
POLL COULD STOKE MORE CRITICISM OF 
THEIR POLITICAL REFORMS SO THE 
CYCLONE WHICH SLAMMED INTO THE 
COASTAL TOWNS AND VILLAGES AND THE 
RICE GROWING IRRAWADDY DELTA ON 
SATURDAY MAY CONTINUE TAKING LIVES 
AID SITS IN WAREHOUSES AND THE 
PEOPLE IT COULD SAVE SIT IN THE 
WRECKAGE OF THEIR HOMES THE REAL 
TRAGEDY OF THIS DISASTER MAY END UP 
BEING THAT PEOPLE DIED EVEN THOUGH 
THE MEANS TO SAVE THEM WERE THERE 
BED STOCK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT 
ANDREW HARDING WHO WAS FOLLOWING 
ALL OF THIS IN BANGKOK LET'S 
TALK A TRULY GRIM PICTURE THE 
NOTION THAT THOSE WHO SURVIVE THE 
CYCLONE MAY DIE BECAUSE AID IS NOT 
GETTING THROUGH 
EXACTLY THERE IS 
HUGE FRUSTRATION HERE IN BANGKOK 
WHERE THE RELIEF EFFORT IS TRYING 
TO GET ORGANISED PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
WHY ARE WE HAVING TO WAIT FIVE DAYS 
TO GET VISAS TO GET THE KEY 
LOGISTICAL PEOPLE IN ON THE GROUND 
WHY ARE THE PLANE'S NOT BEEN GIVEN 
PERMISSION TO LAND WITH EMERGENCY 
RATIONS OF FOOD INSTANT FOOD THAT 
CAN GIVE IMMEDIATE HELP AND 
NUTRITION TO PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY DO 
NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO COOK RICE AND 
OTHER SUPPLIES WHICH MIGHT TURN UP 
THEY NEED THOSE LOGISTICAL EXPERTS 
ON THE GROUND SO THAT THEY CAN GET 
THE AID HAVE TO THE RIGHT PLACES 
AND THEY STILL NEED FOR INSTANCE 
WE SAW AMERICAN WARSHIPS BRINGING 
WATER BY HELICOPTER AND THE 
AMERICANS ARE OFFERING TO DO THAT 
AGAIN BUT THE BURMESE ARE SAY NO 
ANDREW HARDING IN BANGKOK THANK 
YOU YOU I. T. V. HAS BEEN FINED A RECORD SUM OF 
MORE THAN FIVE POINT SIX MILLION BY THE MEDIA 
REGULATOR OFCOM IT IS FOR A 
SUCCESSION OF PHONE VOTE SCANDALS 
ON SOME OF THE CHANNEL'S MOST 
POPULAR PROGRAMMES DANIEL 
BOETTCHER IS AT I. T. V. HEADQUARTERS 
THIS IS THE LATEST IN SERIES OF 
FINES FOR BROADCASTERS RELATING TO 
MISCONDUCT IN THE USE OF PREMIUM 
RATE PHONE SERVICES IT IS BY FAR 
THE HIGHEST ALMOST THREE TIMES THE 
PREVIOUS RECORD AND OFCOM HAS MADE 
IT CLEAR IT WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS 
KIND OF ACTIVITY 
VIEWERS ON ANT AND DEC'S SATURDAY 
NIGHT TAKEAWAY WERE INVITED TO TEXT 
FOR A CHANCE TO WIN CASH FROM 
GIANT PIGGY BANK BUT IT EMERGED 
WINNERS WERE CHOSEN BY HOW CLOSE 
THEY LIVE TO THE LOCATION OR HOW 
GOOD THEY MIGHT APPEAR ON 
TELEVISION IN OTHER WORDS THE 
COMPETITION WAS NOT RANDOM IT WAS 
ONE OF NUMBER OF PROGRAMMES 
IDENTIFIED BY AN INTERNAL REVIEW OF 
PREMIUM RATE PHONE SERVICES IN ALL 
I. T. V. VIEWERS HAD WASTED ALMOST EIGHT 
MILLION ON COMPETITIONS THEY COULD 
NOT WIN OR INTERACTIVE PROGRAMMES 
WERE THEIR VOTES DID NOT COUNT 
THAT IS WHAT THE REGULATOR OFCOM 
HAS BEEN LOOKING AT HIS FINDINGS 
ARE HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE FAILINGS 
IT HAS SAID THE FINE WAS IMPOSED 
FOR SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUS 
BREACHES OF THE BROADCASTING CODE 
CONCERNING THE ABUSE OF PREMIUM 
RATE SERVICES IN ITS PROGRAMMING 
IT SAID THAT THE RECORD FINE 
REFLECTS NOT ONLY THE SERIOUSNESS 
OF I. T. V.'S FAILURES BUT ALSO THEIR 
REPEATED NATURE ANALYSTS BELIEVE 
THIS WILL HURT I. T. V. 
THERE IS NO 
DOUBT THIS WILL HIT THE BOTTOM LINE 
THEY ARE STRUGGLING ANYWAY 
FINANCIALLY THEY ARE LOOKING AT AN 
ADVERTISING DOWNTURN BUT MORE 
DAMAGING WILL BE THE CRITICISM OF 
THE REGULATOR WHEN THEY SAY THAT 
THEY PUT THE NEED TO ENTERTAIN THE 
AUDIENCE ABOUT THE TRUST OF THE 
AUDIENCE 
OTHER BROADCASTERS HAVE AUDIENCE ALREADY BEEN FINED BY OFCOM THE 
B. B. C. FIFTY THOUSAND FOR FAKING A 
COMPETITION WON ON BLUE PETER 
CHANNEL FOUR ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR PHONE 
IN COMPETITIONS AND G. M. T. V. TWO 
MILLION UP TILL NOW THE HIGHEST 
FINE FOR PICKING COMPETITION 
WINNERS BEFORE PHONE LINES HAD 
CLOSED LAST SUMMER MICHAEL GRADE 
PROMISED A ZERO TOLERANCE APPROACH 
AND THE COMPANY IS GIVING ALMOST EIGHT 
MILLION IN COMPENSATION TO 
CHARITIES THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE 
CALCULATION OF THE FINE WITHIN THE 
PAST HOUR I. T. V. HAS PUT OUT A 
STATEMENT IN WHICH MICHAEL GRADE 
SAYS THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS AN 
APPROPRIATE MOMENT TO RESTATE I. T. V.'S 
UNRESERVED APOLOGY TO THE PUBLIC 
FOR BREACHES THAT TOOK PLACE 
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THREE IN JANUARY AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
HE GOES ON TO WARN THAT ANYONE 
WORKING FOR I. T. V. GOING FORWARD IS IN 
NO DOUBT ABOUT THE STANDARDS 
EXPECTED AND THE CONSEQUENCES IF 
THEY FALL SHORT THIS IS NOT OVER 
YET OF STILL LOOKING AT A NUMBER 
OF PROGRAMMES INCLUDING ONE FROM 
I. T. V. AND DATE FROM THE B. B. C. OFCOM 
IS STILL LOOKING 
LET'S TALK TO STEWART PURVIS FROM 
OFCOM GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU 
INSTITUTIONALISE FAILURE PROGRAMME 
MAKERS SHOWING TOTAL DISREGARD FOR 
THEIR OWN TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
WHAT OF EXPECT VERY SENIOR HEADS 
TO ROLL WOULD OF GONE EXPECT 
THAT IS MATTER FOR I. T. V. WE LOOK 
AT THE ROLE OF THE LICENSEE THE 
ORGANISATION WHICH HAS A LICENCE 
FROM US TO BROADCAST AND IN RETURN 
IT HAS TO FULFIL CERTAIN CONDITIONS 
ON THIS OCCASION THE CONDITIONS 
WERE NOT MET NOT JUST ONCE BUT EIGHTY SIX 
TIMES THIS HAPPENED IT HAPPENED 
OVER PERIOD OF FOUR YEARS AND 
THAT RELATIVELY SENIOR LEVEL IN 
PROGRAMME MAKING THE POST OF 
EXECUTIVE PRODUCER IN SOME CASES 
THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER KNEW FROM 
DAY ONE THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT 
MILLIONS OF VIEWERS AT ANY CHANCE 
OF WINNING FOR HAVING THEIR VOTE 
COUNTED 
MICHAEL GRADE HAS SPOKEN COUNTED MANY TIMES ABOUT WANTING TO REBUILD 
PUBLIC TRUST SO THEY ARE STARTING 
FROM A LOW POINT YOU HAVE ANY 
CONFIDENCE THAT I. T. V. IS DOING ENOUGH 
TO ACHIEVE THAT 
THE TEAM AT OFCOM 
HAS SPENT NEARLY A YEAR ON THIS 
INVESTIGATION AND UNCOVERED THINGS 
THAT WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS 
WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD UNDERSTANDING 
OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST 
WE ARE STILL MONITORING THE PRESENT 
FOR INSTANCE TODAY WE HAVE 
ANNOUNCED ONE CASE WHICH WE PUT 
DOWN TO AN ACCIDENT WITHIN THE 
SYSTEM AT I. T. V. WE ARE ON THE ALERT 
FOR THIS AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO 
FINISH THE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE 
OTHER BROADCASTERS THAT YOU 
MENTIONED WE THINK WE KNOW WHAT 
HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST AND WE 
ARE ON THE ALERT FOR WHAT MAY 
HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE BUT 
BROADCASTERS HAVE LEARNED THEIR 
LESSON THEY ARE IN A SENSE 
REGRETTING THAT THEY DID NOT KEEP A 
CLOSE EYE ON THIS ACTIVITY OR IN 
THE CASE OF THE OLD I. T. V. MANAGEMENT 
THAT THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THE 
PROCESS 
I AM SORRY THAT WE HAVE TO PROCESS LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU FOR ALL 
TIME TIME FOREIGN STAFF ARE ABLE TO WORK AT 
BRITISH AIRPORTS EVEN IF THEY HAVE 
COMMITTED CRIMES ABROAD THE B. B. C. 
HAS LEARNED THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE AIRPORT 
EMPLOYEES HAVE HAD TO UNDERGO 
MANDATORY CHECKS BUT THE VETTING 
PROCESS DOES NOT COVER CRIMES 
COMMITTED OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS DEFENDED THE 
SECURITY PROCESS BUT THE 
CONSERVATIVES CALLED THE LOOPHOLE 
ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING JUNE KELLY 
HAS MORE DETAILS 
FOR WESTERN COUNTRIES NINE ELEVEN WAS A 
WATERSHED IN AIRLINE TRAVEL THE 
TERRORISTS EXPOSED AND EXPLOITED 
WEAKNESSES IN THE SYSTEM IN THE U. K. 
STAFF WORKING AIRSIDE IN WHAT IS 
KNOWN AS THE RESTRICTED ZONE NOW 
HAVE TO UNDERGO A CRIMINAL RECORD 
CHECK BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN 
WORKERS IT IS A DIFFERENT STORY 
THERE IS NO CHECK TO SEE IF THEY 
HAVE COMMITTED AN OFFENCE ABROAD 
THE B. B. C.'S NEWSNIGHT PROGRAMME BROKE 
THE STORY 
WHAT WE CAN BE ASSURED 
OF IS THAT EVERYBODY WHO IS WORKING 
IN ONE OF OUR AIRPORTS IS BEING 
SCREENED AND CHECKED AND WE CAN BE 
ASSURED THAT THOSE CHECKS MAKE SURE 
THAT THE TRAVELLING PUBLIC IS SAVED 
HOW MANY FOREIGN CRIMINALS ARE 
WORKING IN OUR AIRPORTS TONIGHT I I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION 
BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW 
IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG AND BE TOO 
COMPLICATED TO CHECK CRIMINAL 
RECORDS SAYS THE GOVERNMENT FOR 
PASSENGERS ONCE AGAIN THIS SUMMER 
STRICTER SECURITY WILL MEAN LONGER 
QUEUES INSIDE THE TERMINALS WHEN WHEN YOU THINK OF THE LEVEL OF 
INCONVENIENCE THEY PUT PASSENGERS 
TO NOT BEEN IN TO CARRY MAKE UP 
NOT BEING ABLE TO CARRY OR VIOLIN 
OR FOUR GOOD REASONS BUT THEY 
CANNOT PUT THE COMPANY'S THROUGH IT 
THE UNION REPRESENTING PILOTS IS 
PERPLEXED 
IF IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR PERPLEXED PILOTS IT SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH 
FOR ANYONE ELSE THESE CHECKS NEED 
TO BE CARRIED OUT ON EVERYONE 
SURELY 
THE DEPARTMENT FOR SURELY TRANSPORT SAYS A REVIEW OF SECURITY 
AMONGST AIRPORT PERSONNEL IS 
CURRENTLY UNDER WAY A CHECK OF 
FOREIGN CRIMINAL RECORDS IS ONE OF 
THE AREAS UNDER SCRUTINY 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS DECIDED TO 
HOLD INTEREST RATES AT FIVE PER CENT DESPITE 
WORRIES ABOUT THE ECONOMY MOST 
ANALYSTS ARE EXPECTING A QUARTER PER CENT 
CUT IN JUNE 
HOW MUCH FOOD TO YOU THROW AWAY AND 
TOUCHED AND EVEN WE ARE THROWING 
AWAY TEN BILLION WORTH OF FOOD 
EVERY YEAR MUCH BEFORE ITS SELL BY 
DATE NICK HIGHAM IS HERE WITH MORE 
THE RESULTS OF THIS SURVEY ARE 
STAGGERING NEXT TIME YOU GO TO THE 
SUPERMARKET THINK ABOUT THIS ONE 
BAG OF FOOD IN EVERY THREE YOU BUY 
AT THE SHOPS IS GOING TO END UP IN 
THE BIN WHAT A WASTE SOME OF THAT 
FOOD WILL HAVE BEEN COOKED AND 
SERVED AND LEFT ON OUR PLATES BUT 
AN ASTONISHING TWO THIRDS OF IT HAS 
NEVER BEEN TOUCHED OR UNWRAPPED 
SOME OF IT HAS NOT EVEN PASSED ITS 
SELL BY DATE EVERY DAY WE THROW 
OUT 
THIS WOMAN KNOWS THE PROBLEM SHE 
IS A BUSY MAN AND TYPICAL OF MANY 
SHOPPERS SHE FINDS HERSELF 
THROWING FOOD AWAY EVERY WEEK 
BUSY MOTHER 
YOU GO TO THE 
SUPERMARKET FOR A PINT OF MILK AND 
BREAD AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COME 
BACK WITH THOSE THINGS YOU THINK 
I'LL BUY SOME APPLES I'LL BUY THAT 
FRESH CREAM CAKE BECAUSE IT IS 
PRESENTED SO WELL ON THE SHELVES 
MUCH OF THE FOOD WE THROW OUT ENDS 
UP IN LANDFILL SITES WHERE IT ROTS 
DOWN TO PRODUCE METHANE ONE OF 
THE MOST DANGEROUS GREEN HOUSE 
GASES THE OTHER COSTS OF ALL THIS 
ARE PRETTY STAGGERING AS WELL 
THERE IS THE COST TO ALL OF US AS 
FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS 
GROWING PROCESSING AND 
TRANSPORTING ALL OF THIS 
UNNECESSARY FOOD PRODUCERS THEN 
THERE IS THE COST TO THE WORLD AT 
LARGE WHICH IS ALREADY STRUGGLING 
TO FEED GROWING POPULATION 
A TEENAGER WHO WAS BRAIN DAMAGE 
WHEN HE WAS KICKED IN THE HEAD ON A 
BOUNCY CASTLE HAS WON DAMAGES 
AGAINST THE COUPLE WHO HIRED IT FOR 
THEIR CHILDREN'S BIRTHDAY PARTY 
SAM HARRIS WAS ELEVEN WHEN HE WAS 
STRUCK ACCIDENTALLY BY FIFTEEN YEAR 
OLD WHILE THEY WERE SOMERSAULTING 
ON THE CASTLE IT IS THOUGHT 
DAMAGES COULD BE IN THE REGION OF 
TWO MILLION 
JON BRAIN IS AT THE HIGH COURT 
THIS COULD SEND A CHILL TO ALL 
PARENTS THINKING OF HIRING A BOUNCY 
CASTLE THE JUDGMENT IMPLIES THAT 
THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE IF ANYTHING 
GOES WRONG THE REASON THAT SAM 
HARRIS RECEIVED HIS INJURIES WAS 
BECAUSE A MUCH OLDER HEAVIER BOY 
WAS ALLOWED ON TO THE INFLATABLE 
HE ACCIDENTALLY KICKED SAM CAUSING 
HIM BRAIN DAMAGE SAM'S MOTHER WAS 
ASKED WHAT THE DAMAGES WOULD MEAN 
FOR HER SON 
HELP EVERYTHING THAT 
HE REALLY NEEDS FOR THE REST OF HIS 
LIFE YOU KNOW IT HAS BEEN SUCH A 
STRUGGLE IT IS JUST REALLY 
HOPEFULLY HE WILL FIND A QUALITY OF 
LIFE ANYTHING FOR HIM REALLY THE THE COUPLE WHO HIRED THE BOUNCY CASTLE 
CATHERINE AND TIMOTHY PERRY ARE 
APPEALING THE MESSAGE BEING GIVEN 
OUT THIS LUNCHTIME IS FOR ANYBODY 
SUPERVISING A BOUNCY CASTLE TO SAY 
TAKE EXTRA SPECIAL CARE 
THE HEADLINES THE FIRST UNITED 
NATIONS PLANE HAS BEEN ALLOWED INTO 
BURMA TO DELIVER EMERGENCY AID TO 
THE SURVIVORS OF THE CYCLONE BUT 
AID AGENCIES SAY MUCH MORE HAS TO 
BE DONE 
COMING UP CALLING ALL SPACE CADETS 
COULD YOU BECOME ONE OF BRITAIN'S 
NEXT ASTRONAUT 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON BRITISH TROOPS 
ARE WELCOMED BACK WITH MILITARY 
CELEBRATIONS AT WINDSOR CASTLE 
AND THE FORMER ROYAL BALLET DANCERS 
WHO ARE WHILING AUDIENCES AT 
SADLER'S WELLS WOWING AUDIENCES 
THE COMMUNICATIONS GIANT CARPHONE 
WAREHOUSE IS SELLING HALF ITS 
RETAIL BUSINESS TO THE AMERICAN 
ELECTRONICS COMPANY BEST BUY 
BEST BUY THAT IS FOR JUST OVER ONE 
MILLION BEST BUY IS THE LARGEST 
COMPANY OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD 
AND THE DEAL WILL SEE THE 
INTRODUCTION OF THE TRAP 
INTRODUCTION OF THE CHAIN ACROSS 
EUROPE EUROPE OVER TWO DECADES IT HAS GROWN FROM 
A FEW STORES SELLING NEW FANGLED 
PORTABLE PHONES TO MAJOR 
COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS CARPHONE 
WAREHOUSE IS NOW GETTING INTO BED 
WITH GIANT AMERICAN RETAILER AND 
EARNING ITSELF ONE BILLION IT IS 
TEAMING UP WITH BEST BUY TO BRING 
TO EUROPE ANOTHER CHAIN OF STORES 
SELLING NOT JUST PHONES BUT JUST 
ABOUT EVERYTHING ELECTRICAL THE THE WORLD IS CHANGING VERY FAST AND WE 
NEED TO ADAPT WHAT WE SELL TO OUR 
CUSTOMERS TO A WIDER RANGE OF 
PRODUCTS WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH 
THE LARGEST ELECTRONICS RETAILER IN 
THE WORLD TO BE ABLE TO BRING IT 
MUCH MORE EXCITING CUSTOMER 
PROPOSITION TO PEOPLE ACROSS EUROPE 
BEST BUY PLANS TO BRING A RECIPE 
THAT HAS WON IT FIFTH OF ELECTRICAL 
SALES IN THE U. S. IT HAS STORES THE 
SIZE OF LARGE BRITISH SUPERMARKET 
THE NEW JET LI OWNED CHAIN WILL 
OPEN IN THE U. K. NEXT YEAR OUR 
BRITISH SHOPPERS READY FOR CHAIN 
OF GIANT NEW STALLS SELLING 
EVERYTHING FROM COMPUTERS TO PHONES 
TO TELEVISIONS THE EVIDENCE IS 
THAT THEY ARE STARTING TO BUY MORE 
OF THOSE GOODS ONLINE THE CURRENT 
BIG NAME IN HIGH STREET ELECTRICAL 
RETAILING IS REALLY STRUGGLING 
DIXONS REBRANDED AS CURRYS DIGITAL 
IS FIGHTING TO KEEP SHOPPERS COMING 
THROUGH ITS STORES IS THERE A 
NEWCOMER 
I'M NOT SURE THE NEWCOMER ELECTRICALS MARKET IS PRETTY 
SATURATED PRETTY MUCH LIKE EVERY 
OTHER RETAIL MARKET IN BRITAIN AT 
THE MOMENT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE 
COMES IN EVERYBODY ELSE IS FORCED 
TO MAKE ROOM 
MEANWHILE CARPHONE 
WAREHOUSE CAN COMPETE EVEN MORE 
FIERCELY AGAINST RIVALS IN THE 
COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS WITH 
ANOTHER ONE BILLION IN ITS BACK 
POCKET POCKET PERCHED ON A CLIFF OVERLOOKING THE 
BAY IN ONE OF YORKSHIRE'S TOP 
BEAUTY SPOTS IT WAS THERE MUCH 
LONGED FOR HOLIDAY HOME OF ONE 
COUPLE STREAMS BUT THAT DREAM HAS 
ENDED ONE COUPLE'S DREAMS THE 
HOUSE IN CAYTON BAY NEAR 
SCARBOROUGH HAS HAD TO BE 
DEMOLISHED A SUDDEN LANDSLIP 
MEMBER BULLDOZERS MOVING IN ON 
PROPERTIES IN THE LAST MONTH AND 
THERE ARE FEARS THAT MORE WILL 
FOLLOW MARK SIMPSON HAS BEEN THERE 
THIS MORNING 
LIVING ON THE EDGE TONY CHARLES 
COULD ONLY WATCH AS HIS GARDEN FELL 
ONE HUNDRED F. T. IN FRONT OF HIS VERY EYES ONE I COULD SEE IT SAT DOWN THERE THEN 
IT WAS A BIT LOW AND A BIT LOWER 
HE IS NOT THE ONLY HOUSEHOLDER WITH 
THAT SINKING FEELING LAST MONTH 
TWO OF HIS NEIGHBOURS POOLE HOMES 
HAD TO BE DEMOLISHED NEIGHBOURS' 
HOMES 
IT STARTED AT NUMBER TWENTY THREE AND HOMES TWENTY FOUR NOW IT HAS WORKED DOWN TO NO 
TWENTY ONE IT MAY MOVE DOWN TO NUMBER TWENTY 
THEY ARE NOT VERY GOOD ARTS FOR FOR MANY PEOPLE IN SCARBOROUGH IT HAS 
BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES OF THE NEARBY 
CLIFFTOP HOTEL WHICH FELL INTO THE 
SEA FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THE PROBLEM WITH 
THIS CLIP IS THAT IT HAS SOMEHOW 
BECOME SATURATED WITH WATER SOME 
RESIDENTS BELIEVE THIS IS A MAN 
MADE PROBLEM BUT OTHERS SAY IT IS 
SIMPLY NATURE WHATEVER THE TRUTH 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER ARE THAT 
THIS HOUSE WHICH BELONGS TO SOME 
PENSIONERS IS ABOUT TO BE 
BULLDOZED AND OTHERS COULD SOON 
FOLLOW 
I AM DEVASTATED REALLY L. FOLLOW NEVER EXPECTED TO MOVE AGAIN L. 
CAME HERE TO RETIRE AND HOPE TO 
SPEND THE REST OF MY DAYS HERE IT 
LOOKS VERY UNLIKELY 
THAT MEANS NOT 
JUST MISSING OUT ON A WORLD CLASS 
FIELD BUT THE COMPLICATED BUSINESS 
OF TRYING TO CLAIM INSURANCE AFTER 
HAVING TO KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN HOUSE 
CONSTRUCTION WORK ON THE LONDON 
OLYMPIC STADIUM WILL BEGIN TWO 
WEEKS TODAY THREE MONTHS AHEAD OF 
SCHEDULE THE SITE AT STRATFORD IN 
EAST LONDON WILL C. D. EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
AND COST NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO 
COMPLETE WILL SEAT DOES THIS 
EARLY START MEAN IT WILL BE READY 
ON TIME LET'S ASK JAMES PEARCE IT IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT JUST A FEW 
MONTHS AGO THERE WERE FACTORIES AND 
OFFICE BLOCKS BEHIND ME HERE NOW 
THERE IS A GIANT SITE THAT HAS BEEN 
CLEARED EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS OF SOIL HAVE 
HAD TO BE MOVED ALONGSIDE ME NOW 
IS DAVID HIGGINS THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OF THE OLYMPIC DELIVERY 
AUTHORITY WHAT CHANCES OF IT BEING 
FINISHED THREE MONTHS EARLY 
IT WAS 
BILLED AS THREE YEARS THERE ONE 
YEAR TO TEST STARTING THREE MONTHS 
AHEAD PUTS AS AHEAD OF PROGRAMME 
THE PROGRAMME IS ACHIEVABLE 
WE CAN 
LOOK AT SOME OF THE DESIGNS 
EXPLAIN WHAT 
IS BEING BUILT THIS THIS IS AN EIGHTY THOUSAND SEATER OLYMPIC STADIUM 
THE IT COMES BACK TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SEATS 
FOR THE STADIUM IT IS VERY COMPACT 
AND CONCISE IT USES SUBSTANTIALLY 
LESS STEEL WHEN YOU WOULD USUALLY 
EXPECT 
ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS EXPECT WILL BE THAT IT WILL COST ABOUT 
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WILL IT COME IN ON 
BUDGET 
WE ARE WORKING TO THAT THE BUDGET MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE FINAL 
COST GOOD PROGRESS LIKE THIS MEANS 
WE HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF ACHIEVING 
A FINAL COST THAT MEETS THE BUDGET 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS WILL 
CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IT HAS 
TURNOVER LAST FEW MONTHS IN FEW 
MONTHS IT SHOULD BE LOOKING VERY 
DIFFERENT TO WHAT IT IS NOW 
NO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE NECESSARY 
BUT YOU MUST BE FIT HAVE A SCIENCE 
DEGREE AND BE PREPARED TO UNDERGO 
TEN YEARS OF TRAINING THE EUROPEAN 
SPACE AGENCY IS SEEKING A RETREAT 
RECRUITS FOR MISSIONS WHICH COULD 
INCLUDE WORKING ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND 
EVEN THE MOON APPLICATIONS OPEN 
SOON OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT HAS 
BEEN FINDING OUT WHAT IS INVOLVED 
ASTRONAUTS WANTED NO EXPERIENCE 
NECESSARY TWENTY YEARS AGO A BRITISH 
SCIENTIST AND SAID IT JUST SUCH AN 
ADVERT AND SHE BECAME AN ASTRONAUT 
AND THE RUSSIAN MIR SPACE STATION 
ON THE THE NOW THE EUROPEAN 
SPACE AGENCY IS ASKING MEMBERS OF 
THE PUBLIC TO APPLY TO ITS 
ASTRONAUT CORPS CANDIDATES SHOULD 
THE JOB IS GREAT THE FLIGHTS ARE 
FANTASTIC 
AT A RECRUITMENT DRIVE FANTASTIC IN LONDON YOUNG HOPEFULS WERE 
ALREADY PUTTING IN THEIR 
APPLICATIONS 
I HAVE WANTED TO BE APPLICATIONS AN ASTRONAUT SINCE I WAS TWELVE YEARS 
OLD MY ENTIRE LIFE I HAVE BEEN 
THE AMBITION AND DETERMINED TO GET 
TO THIS GOAL 
WITH NASA SAYING IT 
WANTS TO WORK WITH OTHER COUNTRIES 
TO SEND ASTRONAUTS BACK TO THE MOON 
IT IS POSSIBLE UNSUCCESSFUL 
CANDIDATES MAY ACTUALLY SET FOOT ON 
THE LUNAR SURFACE 
WE'RE INTERESTED 
IN YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING AND 
READY TO EXPLORE WHO FEEL THE URGE 
TO EXPLORE AND WOULD LIKE TO 
UNDERSTAND THE UNKNOWN 
BUT BRITISH

GROUND THAT IS BECAUSE FOR YEARS 
THE U. K. HAS NOT PAID TO TAKE PART IN 
THE ASTRONAUT PROGRAMME 
LET'S TALK TO ONE OF THOSE 
APPLICANTS GAIL ISLE SHE JOINS ME 
FROM THE SPACE GALLERY AT THE 
SCIENCE MUSEUM IN LONDON AN 
INTERVIEW PANEL OF ONE HERE TODAY 
WHY WOULD YOU LIKE THIS JOB WELL WELL I BELIEVE I 
HAVE THE RIGHT STUFF L. HAVE BEEN TRAINING VERY HARD FOR A 
NUMBER OF YEARS TO GET MY PHYSICS 
DEGREES I AM ALSO A SKIED DRIVE 
SKYDIVER AND FLY AN AEROPLANE IT 
IS AN EXCITING TIME WAS BASED THE 
EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY HAS JUST 
LAUNCHED THE COLUMBA'S AUTHORITY 
AND ALSO THE A. T. V. WAS A RESOUNDING 
SUCCESS THERE WILL BE SO MUCH 
SCOPE FOR PERFORMING SCIENCE WITH 
A PERMANENT BASE ON THE MOON 
THINGS ARE LOOKING VERY EXCITING 
THEY ARE EXPECTING AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND 
APPLICANTS WE HEAR HOW CONFIDENT 
ARE YOU 
I'M VERY CONFIDENT L. 
THINK I HAVE GOT THE RIGHT STUFF 
THANKS VERY MUCH GOOD LUCK ALL 
THE BEST TO YOU OF COURSE WHAT A 
FANTASTIC PROJECT 
WE HAD BETTER COME RIGHT BACK DOWN

SUMMER WITH NOTHING IN BETWEEN 
PRINTING MORE TO COME OVER THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS INCLUDING THE WEEKEND

THE SOUTH WEST THROUGH TONIGHT AND 
TOMORROW BRINGING SHOWERY 
OUTBREAKS OF RAIN AHEAD OF THAT 
LOTS OF SUNSHINE TO COME IT IS 
PUSHING UP THOSE TEMPERATURES A 
LITTLE BIT COOLER ALONG THOSE
