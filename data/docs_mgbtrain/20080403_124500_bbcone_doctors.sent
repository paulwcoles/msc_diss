FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE LATE FOR THE MEETING 
AND NOW AT YOUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY YOU'RE RUSHING OFF OUTSIDE 
PAINED 
MORNING JOE I SAID I WAS SORRY 
I'M GONNA TRY AND PUT IT RIGHT AS SOON AS I CAN 
HOW DO YOU PLAN TO DO THAT THEN 
YOU CERTAINLY PICKED YOUR MOMENT DIDN'T YOU 
DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO HELP YOUR COUSIN 
OF COURSE NOT I PUT MY NAME AND MY REPUTATION ON THE LINE FOR YOU 
A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE MILL WANTED SHOT OF YOU 
I SAID NO DANIEL'S A GOOD LAD GIVE HIM JUST ONE MORE CHANCE 
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW LOYALTY IF IT PUNCHED YOU IN THE FACE 
ALL RIGHT I'M SORRY 
WOAH I'M IMPRESSED I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM THAT ANGRY SINCE I ENDED UP IN THE CELLS ON MY FOURTEENTH BIRTHDAY 
JOE'S GOT A LOT ON HIS PLATE 
THE ONLY REASON HE KICKED OFF IS BECAUSE HE'S WORRIED SICK ABOUT YOU 
AS AM I I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M SORRY 
THIS PROBABLY COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED AT A WORSE TIME FOR YOU 
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME WHATEVER HAPPENS 
DON'T 
DON'T BE STUPID 
YOU COULDN'T HAVE FOUND A BETTER WAY TO TAKE MY MIND OFF THINGS 
THIS IS JUST WHAT I NEED 
SOME DRAMA A JUICY BIT OF GOSS RIGHT HERE IN MY LAP 
NOW I WANT THE WHOLE STORY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IN ALL ITS GLORY 
ALL RIGHT 
JULIA YEAH NO I'LL BE THERE IN A SEC

IT'S ALL RIGHT I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU 
MICHELLE 
DO I KNOW YOU 
WE AGREED EIGHT O'CLOCK 
I KNOW I'M SORRY 
MY CAR ISN'T READY SO I HAD TO CATCH THE BUS 
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL AND LET ME KNOW 
WELL BECAUSE I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE IT 
THAT'S FROM YESTERDAY THE FIGHT 
I THOUGHT THE IDEA WAS TO HIDE IT NOT MAKE A POINT OF IT 
I WAS TRYING TO DO THAT IT'S HARDLY MY FAULT IS IT 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PATIENTS WILL THINK 
HONESTLY BRAWLING LIKE DRUNKEN SAILORS 
INSTEAD OF PROFESSIONAL HEALTHCARERS 
WE CAN'T HAVE THIS MEETING NOW I'VE GOT TO FIND NICK AND JOE 
WE'VE GOT TO SORT OUT THIS DANIEL SLASH ARCHIE SITUATION 
TO BE HONEST DISMISSAL IS A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY FOR BOTH OF THEM 
SURELY THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO IS TALK TO THEM 
MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THE INCIDENT 
AND THEN SEE IF WORKING TOGETHER IS A VIABLE OPTION 
THIS WASN'T JUST A FEW CROSS WORDS IN THE STAFF ROOM NICK 
O. K. BUT COME ON GEORGE AND I HAVE BEEN THROUGH WORSE 
JOE 
WELL IT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY 
I MEAN IT WAS BAD 
IT WAS DISGRACEFUL BUT DANIEL'S FAMILY 
AND IN THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES 
LOOK WE DON'T WANT TO PUSH JOE INTO A CLEAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST DO WE 
O. K. WELL I'LL GET THEM IN THIS AFTERNOON 
SEE WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO SAY FOR THEMSELVES 
OH MICHELLE MICHELLE 
JULIA IT'S FOR YOU OH 
DO WE KNOW EACH OTHER 
MICHELLE 
YEAH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
MICHELLE CORRIGAN 
ARE YOU ONE OF MY PATIENTS 
MICHELLE CORRIGAN 
TEN A 
DOUBLE ENGLISH AFTER BREAK 
MR. FARNESWORTH 
MICHELLE 
PLEASE DON'T GO ANYWHERE 
MICHELLE WHAT IS GOING ON 
FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE LATE FOR THE MEETING 
AND NOW AT YOUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY YOU'RE RUSHING OFF OUTSIDE 
I RAN INTO ONE OF MY OLD TEACHERS 
ONE OF THE GOOD ONES AND WELL HE'S HAVING A TOUGH TIME SO ER 
RIGHT FINE O. K. FINE 
FINE BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE YOUR SCHOOL REUNIONS IN YOUR TIME 
NO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE'S 
HE'S WHAT DOESN'T MATTER SORRY 
EMILY'S TOLD ME ABOUT HER CONDITION 
TO BE HONEST IT HASN'T SUNK IN YET 
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO 
THANKS SHE'S GONNA NEED IT 
PARTICULARLY IF DANIEL'S PERFORMANCE YESTERDAY IS ANYTHING TO GO BY 
WITH HER STAYING OVER HERE THE MORE FRIENDLY FACES THE BETTER 
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S FOR THE BEST 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT WAS HER DECISION 
SURE SURE 
BUT I KIND OF GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE'S DOING IT FOR YOU 
YOU'RE THE WHOLE REASON SHE'S HERE 
HER FRIENDS HER MUM HER LIFE PRETTY MUCH ARE BACK IN BOSTON 
BUT SHE WAS SO ENTHUSIASTIC 
I NEVER THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE 
SHE'S A GOOD KID 
SHE LOVES YOU AND YOU'RE HER DOCTOR 
SHE NEEDS YOU 
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S NOT GOING TO MISS EVERYTHING ELSE 
YOU MEAN GETTING THROUGH ALL THIS IS GOING TO BE DISRUPTIVE ENOUGH 
WITHOUT HER HAVING TO LEAVE EVERYTHING ELSE BEHIND 
AND IT'S NOT LIKE SHE WOULDN'T GET DECENT TREATMENT IN THE U. S. 
I'LL GO AND TALK TO HER 
IT'LL MEAN MISSING THE DISCIPLINARY MEETING 
BUT ALL IN ALL THAT'S PROBABLY NO BAD THING 
ABSOLUTELY I'LL SMOOTH THINGS OVER WITH JULIA

BUT THAT'S JUST THE PROBLEM 
LISTEN WE'RE NOT STUPID ALL RIGHT 
WHY ARE WE GOING TO LISTEN TO A COMPLETE STRANGER 
AND DO AS SHE SAYS WHEN WE CAN'T EVEN DO IT FOR EACH OTHER 
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING IT FOR OURSELVES 
THINGS AREN'T GETTING BETTER 
NO SO WHY BARE OUR SOULS TO A STRANGER 
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AND WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE 
BUT THIS ISN'T WORKING IS IT 
IT'S ONLY BEEN ONE SESSION 
YOU DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK 
FINE IF THAT'S ALL OUR MARRIAGE MEANS THEN OFF YOU GO 
O. K. I'LL COME I JUST THINK WE NEED TO TRY THAT'S ALL 
I SAID I'LL COME 
THANKS 
WHEN DID ALL THIS START 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
YOU WERE ALWAYS TALKING 
THAT'S WHY WE LOVED YOUR CLASS SO MUCH 
ALWAYS ENCOURAGING US TO SAY WHAT WE THOUGHT 
NOT ANY MORE 
I COULDN'T DO IT THEIR WAY 
I TRIED BUT 
WELL YOU ALWAYS WERE A BIT DIFFERENT 
HOW DID YOU END UP LIKE THIS 
I STOPPED TALKING 
THEY SAID I WAS ILL 
BUT THERE WAS NO POINT 
NOTHING TO SAY 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY WEREN'T YOU MARRIED

AND THAT'S JUST FOR STARTERS YOUR RIBS 
MICHELLE SORRY WOULD YOU TELL ME

WHY'D YOU DO THAT 
SORRY WE CAN HELP YOU IF YOU LET US 
WE CAN GET YOU FED CLEANED UP 
EVEN FIND SOMEONE THAT YOU CAN TALK TO ABOUT ALL THIS

FINE BE LIKE THAT THEN 
REMEMBER EARLIER I SAID I RAN INTO AN OLD TEACHER OF MINE YEAH 
WELL THAT WAS HIM MR. FARNESWORTH 
OH I SEE 
JULIA HE WAS JUST THE BEST 
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN I REALISED IT WAS HIM 
HOW DID HE END UP ON THE STREET 
DUNNO HE HASN'T SAID MUCH 
SAID TODAY WAS THE FIRST TIME HE'D SPOKEN IN AGES 
M. M. M. WELL IT SOUNDS AS IF HE'S HAD SOME SORT OF A BREAKDOWN 
YEAH WON'T ACCEPT ANY HELP THOUGH 
JUST GOES QUIET AND I KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE I KNOW HIM 
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM FOR TEN YEARS BUT 
I KNOW YOU FEEL LIKE YOU OWE HIM 
HE'S A TEACHER HE SHOULDN'T BE SLEEPING ROUGH 
HE'S GOT A HOME A WIFE OUT THERE 
SHE'S PROBABLY SICK WITH WORRY 
IF I COULD GET THEM BACK IN CONTACT 
IT ISN'T ALWAYS THAT SIMPLE 
I'VE GOT TO TRY 
ONE STEP AT A TIME 
YOU CAN'T MAKE HIM DO SOMETHING HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO 
THE FACT THAT HE'S TALKING TO YOU THAT'S PROGRESS IN ITSELF 
YEAH YEAH I SUPPOSE 
AND THERE CAN'T BE THAT MANY FARNESWORTHS IN THE PHONE BOOK 
JOE ASKED ME TO APOLOGISE FOR HIS ABSENCE 
HE HAD SOMETHING TO ATTEND TO AT HOME 
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT 
IT SEEMED PRETTY URGENT BUT HE DIDN'T SPECIFY 
OH DEAR WELL WE'D BETTER GET STARTED WITHOUT HIM THEN 
MRS. FARNESWORTH YES 
I'M MICHELLE CORRIGAN FROM THE MILL HEALTH CENTRE RIGHT 
IT'S ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND MY HUSBAND 
YEAH WE'VE FOUND HIM 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'VE FOUND HIM IS HE DEAD 
OH NO NO NOTHING LIKE THAT 
HE'S HERE HE'S IN LETHERBRIDGE AND HE'S FINE MORE OR LESS RIGHT 
THE ONLY TROUBLE IS HE'S HOMELESS 
SLEEPING ROUGH I KNOW 
YOU KNOW 
YOU'D BETTER COME IN 
RIGHT WE'RE ALL PAINFULLY AWARE OF WHY WE'RE HERE 
SO WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY 
NEITHER OF YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY 
IT WAS JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING 
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN 
NOT THE MOST ELOQUENT APOLOGY ARCHIE BUT IT'S A START DANIEL 
YEAH I'M SORRY TOO 
YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT SOME SCHOOLBOY NONSENSE 
IT COULDN'T BE MORE SERIOUS 
BOTH YOUR JOBS ARE HANGING BY A THREAD 
NOW I WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS SAID 
ASK HIM 
YOU'RE PATHETIC HEY 
I'M ASKING A QUESTION HERE 
LOOK WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I DON'T SEE THE POINT OF THIS 
YOU'VE ALREADY DECIDED TO GET RID OF ME 
YOU SAID AS MUCH YOURSELF SO WHY THE CHARADE 
NO FINAL DECISIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN YET 
RIGHT JULIA 
WELL THEY HADN'T 
WE FOOLISHLY THOUGHT YOU'D WELCOME A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN 
HAS THIS GOT TO DO WITH ANOTHER STAFF MEMBER 
MELODY NO WHAT THEN 
URM COME ON 
JUST GET IT OUT THE WAY TELL THEM 
YOU'RE ITCHING TO WE CAN ALL SEE THAT 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE BOTTLE 
ALL RIGHT I WILL THE FIGHT HAPPENED 
BECAUSE LITTLE MISS PERFECT HERE HAS GIVEN ME GRIEF 
SINCE HE FOUND OUT I'VE BEEN WORKING AS AN ESCORT 
THERE YOU GO HAPPY 
YOU WERE WORKING AS A WHAT 
YOU TOLD HIM TO GO YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND NOBODY DOES 
I UNDERSTAND HE'S OUT THERE HAVING A HARD TIME 
YES AND WHAT ABOUT ME 
I HARDLY RECOGNISED HIM 
IT WASN'T UNTIL HE SAID MY NAME THAT I REALISED WHO HE WAS 
HE REMEMBERED SOME OF THE LESSONS THAT HE TOOK ME FOR 
AH I SEE YOU'RE ANOTHER ONE OF HIS KIDS ARE YOU FROM SCHOOL 
ANOTHER ONE I'VE HAD SEVERAL OF YOU LOT COMING ROUND TELLING ME 
WHERE HE IS PLEADING WITH ME TO SEE HIM TAKE HIM BACK 
BUT YOU JUST DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE 
THEN WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME 
THAT BLASTED SCHOOL 
YOU LOT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED 
I THINK HE LOVED ALL OF IT MORE THAN ME 
AND BECUASE OF THAT YOU THREW HIM OUT 
NO NOT BECAUSE OF THAT 
HE LIVED TO TEACH BACK AT THE BEGINNING 
HE USED TO COME HOME FULL OF LIFE ENERGY 
CHATTING ABOUT ALL THE STUFF THE KIDS HAD GOT UP TO 
REALLY ENJOYED IT ALL 
BRIDGER HIGH MAY NOT HAVE HAD THE SMARTEST KIDS BUT IT WAS FUN 
SO 
THEN THE HEAD TEACHER CHANGES COMES IN WITH NEW IDEAS 
BUT DEREK WAS ALREADY A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE 
HE REFUSED TO CHANGE THE WAY HE TAUGHT 
THEY WANTED HIM TO RETRAIN 
IT WAS OBVIOUS THEY WERE TRYING TO EASE HIM OUT 
I TOLD HIM TO LEAVE I MEAN THEY WERE MAKING HIS LIFE HELL THERE 
BUT HE WOULDN'T IT WAS MAKING HIM ILL 
THE STRESS I COULD SEE IT IN HIM GRINDING HIM DOWN DAY AFTER DAY 
HE BECAME MOODY AGGRESSIVE CHANGEABLE JUST LIKE THE TEENAGERS 
CLOSED DOWN 
YOU DON'T GO BACK TO A PLACE TO GET ABUSED DAY AFTER DAY DO YOU 
AND HE WAS BRINGING IT HOME WITH HIM 
BUT HE WOULDN'T LEAVE 
I JUST COULDN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE 
YOU ASKING HIM TO GIVE UP HIS PASSION MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD FOR HIM 
BUT HE WAS GIVING UP ON ME TOO 
HE WAS CLOSING DOWN TO ME 
HE WAS HAVING A BREAKDOWN 
IS THAT WHAT CHOOSING NOT TO SPEAK TO ME IS A BREAKDOWN 
YEAH YEAH THAT'S PART OF IT 
BUT TO NOT SPEAK AT ALL NOT TO SAY A WORD 
I DON'T THINK HE MEANT TO SHUT YOU OUT IT JUST SOUNDS 
LIKE HE WAS HAVING A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME TOLD YOU THIS HAS HE 
WELL NO NOT EXACTLY BUT HE HAS TRIED TO COMMUNICATE 
LOOK HE'S ONLY DOWN THE ROAD WHY DON'T YOU JUST POP IN SEE HIM 
NO I'VE ALREADY MADE THAT MISTAKE GONE AND SEEN HIM 
WHEN SOME OTHER DO GOODER POKED THEIR NOSE IN BEFORE 
STOOD THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGH STREET 
PLEADING WITH THIS TRAMP TO TALK TO ME AND HE WOULDN'T 
I REALISED THERE'S QUITE A CROWD GATHERING 
AND IT'S ME THEY'RE LOOKING AT 
A CRACKED UP HOUSEWIFE BOTHERING A HOMELESS MAN 
I MUST HAVE LOOKED AS MAD AS HIM 
WELL THAT MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD FOR YOU 
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE HE WASN'T READY THEN MAYBE THIS TIME HE IS READY 
YOU CAJOLING HIM INTO TALKING ABOUT A SNIFFLE OR A COUGH 
IS HARDLY HIM READY TO SPEAK TO ME IS IT 
WELL NO IT WOULDN'T BE BUT IT WASN'T A COLD 
HE'S BEEN REALLY BADLY BEATEN UP 
AND IT WASN'T ME WHO SPOKE FIRST 
YOU DO WANT HIM BACK DON'T YOU 
I'M NOT STILL DOING IT WHAT WERE YOU THINKING 
I NEEDED MONEY I KNOW THE MECHANICS OF PROSTITUTION DANIEL 
IT WAS NEVER ABOUT SEX 
OH WELL THAT'S O. K. THEN WHAT IF A PATIENT HAD SEEN YOU 
I KNOW IT WAS STUPID I KNOW THAT 
JOE MADE ME PAINFULLY AWARE OF THAT THAT'S WHY I STOPPED 
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS 
GREAT I SUPPOSE YOU DIDN'T THINK TO TELL ME 
HE'S A GROWN UP 
YEAH RIGHT LOOK IT'S NOBODY ELSE'S FAULT JULIA O. K. NOT NICK'S 
NOT JOE'S NOT EVEN HIS 
JUST MINE AND IF YOU WANT TO BLAME ME FOR THE FIGHT GREAT 
GO AHEAD WE KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DISMISS ME 
SO JUST GET ON WITH IT 
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT JUDGING BY YOUR ACTIONS 
IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS AND IT HAS BEEN SINCE ARCHIE FOUND OUT 
IF YOU WANT TO YOU SACK ME THAT'S FINE 
IF THAT'S YOUR ATTITUDE NO IT'S FINE 
EMILY HAS A LIFE THREATENING CONDITION 
YOU WANT SHOT OF ME IT ALL FITS PERFECTLY 
I'LL STAY HOME AND LOOK AFTER HER 
ANYTHING'S BETTER THAN HAVING HIM ON MY CASE DAY IN DAY OUT 
SO LET'S JUST CUT OUR LOSSES 
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING AND GOODBYE 
HE SHOULD BE ROUND THE CORNER 
I TRIED TO GET HIM INSIDE BUT HE BOLTED 
NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
DEREK 
DEREK MICHELLE HERE SAID SHE'D SEEN YOU 
YOU'RE LOOKING 
MICHELLE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE READY TO TALK 
I TOLD YOU IT'D BE A WASTE OF TIME 
SO THAT'S IT IS IT 
I WAIT ALL THIS TIME AND YOU STILL HAVE NOTHING TO SAY YOU 
YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ME DO YOU YOU SELFISH LITTLE SO AND SO 
I KNEW THIS WAS A BAD IDEA 
JUST WHEN YOU THINK IT CAN'T HURT ANY MORE 
I'M A STUPID STUPID WOMAN 
MARY I AM SO SORRY BUT PLEASE JUST WAIT HERE 
PLEASE 
DAD WHAT'S WRONG NOTHING I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING 
WELL ASK ME YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT A BIT 
NICK SAID THAT HE RECKONED 
YOU'D RATHER BE BACK WITH YOUR MUM THAN HERE 
WHAT I DIDN'T SAY THAT 
NO HE DIDN'T SAY THAT YOU DID 
HE JUST THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU'D RATHER DO IN AN IDEAL WORLD 
WELL YEAH MAYBE BUT IN AN IDEAL WORLD I WOULDN'T BE ILL WOULD I 
AND MONEY'D GROW ON TREES AND GETTING TO BOSTON AND BACK 
COULD TAKE HALF AN HOUR AND YOU AND MUM'D NEVER ARGUE BUT 
YEAH WELL LIFE ISN'T PERFECT 
TELL ME ABOUT IT YOU KNOW SINCE THE DIAGNOSIS 
BUT I KNOW I'VE GOT YOU AND MUM AND DANIEL 
AND YOU'RE ALL THERE FOR ME 
JUST NOT HERE 
NO BUT 
NO ONE'S GOT NOTHING TO SAY 
REMEMBER THAT YOU TOLD US THAT EACH OF US HAD A VOICE AND IT WAS UNIQUE 
AND IT WAS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF NO MATTER WHAT 
YOU WERE ALWAYS SAYING THINGS LIKE SPEAK UP 
MAKE YOURSELF HEARD OVER THE DIN OF THE WORLD 
YOU WERE THE BEST THING ABOUT THAT SCHOOL THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO 
SO WHAT ARE YOU JUST GONNA SHUT UP TILL THE DAY YOU DIE 
YOU NEVER GAVE UP ON US NOT ANY OF US 
YOU TOLD US THAT GIVING UP WAS THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD FAIL AT ANYTHING 
I ALWAYS BELIEVED IN YOU 
BUT NOW SEEING YOU LIKE THIS I JUST THINK DID HE REALLY MEAN 
THOSE THINGS OR WAS HE JUST SAYING IT BECAUSE IT SOUNDED GOOD 
WAS HE JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHERS 
WHO ARE YOU REALLY GIVING UP ON MARY OR YOURSELF 
I KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY BUT YOU WERE NEVER SHY OF HARD WORK 
CHALLENGES ARE WHAT MAKE US WHO WE ARE 
REMEMBER THAT MR. FARNESWORTH 
YOU WERE ALWAYS TROUBLE CORRIGAN 
MARY I'M SO SORRY 
ALL I WANT IS FOR YOU TO GET BETTER 
WELL DUH YOU ARE A DOCTOR 
AND AS A DOCTOR I KNOW THAT PATIENTS FARE BETTER 
IN FAMILIAR SETTINGS SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS AND FAMILY 
AND I'VE DECIDED TO SAY HERE WITH YOU MY DAD 
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DECIDE 
BESIDES YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SAY IN THE MATTER 
ARE YOU TELLING ME TO GO HOME
