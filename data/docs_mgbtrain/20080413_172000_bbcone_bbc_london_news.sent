HART ACTION GROUP SAYS IT 
REPRESENTS A COMMUNITY FIGHTING 
AGAINST CORPORATE BULLYING THE 
MAKING ANY 
SUPERMARKET DENIES MAKING ANY PROMISES PROMISES BUILDING WORK IS ALREADY UNDER WAY 
ON THE SITE WHERE A NEW SAINSBURY'S 
IS CAUSING QUITE A STIR IN BARNES 
LAST SUMMER RESIDENTS TOOK PART IN 
A LOCAL REFERENDUM WHERE EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF 
THEM VOTED AGAINST THE NEW STORE 
BUT THE VOTE HAD NO LEGAL STATUS 
AND THE SUPERMARKET GOT PLANNING 
PERMISSION ANYWAY NOW THE GROUP 
ARE LEADING THE LOCAL CAMPAIGN 
CLAIM SAINSBURY'S HAS GONE BACK ON 
A PROMISE TO THEM 
IF WE COULD FIND 
SOMEBODY TO TAKE OVER THE LEASE AT 
THE RIGHT RATES WITH THE PREMIUM 
ET CETERA THEN SAINSBURY'S WOULD 
BOW OUT OUT GRATEFULLY AND WITH OUR 
BLESSING AND THANKS WE'VE GOT 
NOTHING AGAINST SAINSBURY'S THIS 
IS ABOUT SAINSBURY'S THE CORPORATE 
BULLY NOT THE GROCERS 
IN A 
STATEMENT TO US A SPOKESMAN SAID 
IT'S JUST BEEN SO UNFAIR BECAUSE 
EVERYONE'S TRIED TO STOP IT AND 
THERE ARE SO FEW PLACES LEFT THAT 
ARE VILLAGEY 
IT'LL BE CLOSER MORE 
CONVENIENT I SUPPOSE 
THERE'S LOTS 
OF LOVELY SHOPS HERE L. DON'T THINK 
SINCE BRINGS IS NECESSARY HERE 
CAMPAIGNERS CONCEDE THEIR FIGHT IS 
MORE DIFFICULT SINCE BUILDING WORK 
ACTUALLY STARTED ON THE SITE BUT 
THEY'RE NOW URGING RESIDENCE TO 
BOYCOTT THE STORE ONCE IT OPENS

REGISTER TO VOTE IN THE MAYORAL 
ELECTIONS THERE'S LAST MINUTE 
PUSH TO GET MORE BRITISH CHINESE 
PEOPLE TO THE BALLOT BOX IN THE 
PAST THERE'S BEEN HIGH LEVEL OF 
VOTER APATHY IN THE COMMUNITY 
IN ORDER TO GET PEOPLE TO VOTE WE 
HAVE TO LET THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT

EMPOWERMENT AND ALSO INSPIRATION 
AND ALSO WE NEED PEOPLE TO VOTE

EAST AFTER SOME MORNING SHOWERS A 
GOOD PART OF SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN
