THOUSANDS OF PUPILS ARE LOCKED OUT

HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO 
THE B. B. C. NEWS AT ONE HUNDRED P. M. OVER TWO 
AND A HALF MILLION SCHOOL CHILDREN 
IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAVE BEEN 
AFFECTED BY THE FIRST NATIONAL 
STRIKE BY TEACHERS IN TWENTY ONE YEARS THE 
ACTION HAS CLOSED OR PARTIALLY 
CLOSED AROUND EIGHT THOUSAND SCHOOLS THEY 
ARE STRIKING OVER PAY SAYING IT IS 
BELOW THE RATE OF INFLATION AND 
WILL AFFECT FUTURE RECRUITMENT THE 
ACTING SECRETARY OF THE NUT SAID 
CHILDREN WILL SUFFER IF UNION'S 
DEMANDS ARE NOT MET NOW THE ACTION 
HAS BEEN CONDEMNED BY ALL MAIN 
POLITICAL PARTIES MANY OF THE 
STRIKING TEACHERS ARE ATTENDING 
RALLIES TODAY MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND 
TEACHERS ARE GATHERED HERE IN 
CENTRAL LONDON WITH SCENES WE HAVE 
NOT SEEN SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE 
TEACHERS HERE THOUGH WHILE MANY 
ARE SURPRISED BY THEIR ACTION THEY 
ARE DEFIANT THEY SAY THE CURRENT 
GOVERNMENT OFFER OF JUST UNDER TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
IS NOT ENOUGH THEY ARE DEMANDING A 
PAY DEAL OF MORE LIKE FORTY ONE PER CENT 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE CURRENT RETAIL 
PRICE INDEX OF INFLATION THEY SAY 
WITHOUT THAT THEY HAVE NO CHOICE 
BUT TO GO ON STRIKE CLOSED FOR 
BUSINESS AROUND ONE IN THREE 
SCHOOLS TURNED PUPILS AWAY THIS 
MORNING TODAY'S STRIKE THE 
BIGGEST DISRUPTION TO EDUCATION FOR 
A GENERATION THIS PRIMARY IN 
CARDIFF MANAGED TO OPEN BUT ONLY 
FOR A FRACTION OF PUPILS HERE THEY 
HAD ENOUGH STAFF FOR JUST TWO 
CLASSES ELSEWHERE LIKE IN THIS 
SECONDARY SCHOOL IN PLYMOUTH 
NORMALLY BUSY CLASSROOMS AND CAN 
TEENS LAY EMPTY ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
MORE THAN ONE MILLION PUPILS WERE 
FORCED TO STAY AT HOME 
INCONVENNIENCEING PARENTS 
THEY ARE 
NOT THINKING ABOUT THE SINGLE 
PARENT WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE 
TIME OFF WORK 
I HAVE TWO KIDSVY 
TO FIND SOMEBODY TO LOOK AFTER THEM 
THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH MONEY THEY 
DON'T START WORK WHEN THEY COME 
HOME THEY STILL HAVE PAPERWORK TO 
DO 
TEACHERS TRY TO MINIMISE THE DO IMPACT ON PUPIL'S LEARNING MANY 
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TEACHERS' PAY 
WE HAVE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGH 
QUALITY STAFF TEACHERS COMING INTO 
THE PROFESSION OVER THE LAST TEN 
YEARS HAVE BEEN HIGH QUAL QUALITY 
WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE MOMENTUM 
WE NEED TO PAY THEM APPROPRIATELY 
FOR SOME PUPILS ABOUT TO START 
THEIR GCSE EXAMS IN JUST OVER A 
WEEK THE STRIKE COULD NOT HAVE 
COME AT A WORSE TIME 
THEY ARE KIND 
OF TAKING IT OUT ON US IN A WAY WE 
DON'T HAVE A SAY IN IT WE CAN'T 
VOTE OR ANYTHING WE DON'T HAVE A 
SAY IN IT IT IS NOT REALLY FAIR 
IT IS SELFISH IN THAT RESPECT 
MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF 
TEACHERS WERE DEFIANT AT RALLIES 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN CENTRAL 
LONDON THOUSANDS MAR FPBED TO SHOW 
THEIR FEELINGS MANY LIKE THIS 
WOMAN FEEL THEY ARE LEFT BEHIND BY 
INFLATION SHE HAS TO PAY OFF A 
TWENTY THOUSAND LOAN SHE SAYS IT WILL 
LEAVE HER WORSE OFF 
I AM ANGRY AT 
THE SITUATION THE FACT THAT THE 
INFLATION RATE ON MY STUDENT LOAN 
IS HIGHER THAN WHAT I GET ON MY 
WAGE HOW IS THAT FAIR HOW IS THAT 
GOVERNMENT SHOWING THEY ARE VALUING 
EDUCATION 
DESPITE THEIR STRENGTH EDUCATION OF FEELING THE STRIKING TEACHERS 
DON'T HAVE SUPPORT FROM THE WHOLE 
PROFESSION THEIR ACTION CONDEMNED 
ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM THE 
QUESTION NOW WHETHER THEIR UNION 
CAN DECIDE TO TURN THIS ONE DAY 
STRIKE INTO LONGER TERM DISRUPTION 
WHEN THOUSANDS OF PUPILS ARE FORCED 
TO STAY AT HOME THE EFFECTS ARE 
FELT WAY BEYOND THE SCHOOLS 
THEMSELVES AS CATHERINE HAS FOUND 
OUT IN WEST YORKSHIRE 
IT IS NORMALLY SCHOOL TIME INSTEAD 
OF THE USUAL RUSH THIS FAMILY ARE 
STUCK INDOORS ON A RAINY DAY 
RACHEL'S ELDEST SON CAN'T GO INTO

ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL AS NORMAL 
RACHEL IS A SINGLE MUM WITH THREE 
CHILDREN SHE'S HAD NO CHOICE BUT 
TO TAKE THE DAY OFF WORK SHE FEELS

RACHEL SHOULD BE WORKING TODAY A 
CAFE SMALL BUSINESS THAT HAS BEEN 
HIT HARD BY THE TEACHERS' STRIKE

BIG IMPACT

USUALLY RELIES ON PUPILS TO BOOST 
LUNCH TIME TAKINGS HIS BUSINESS

THE TEACHERS' STRIKE 
I OBVIOUSLY 
HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
WORKING FOR US YOU HAVE ONE PERSON 
OFF PER CENTAGE WISE IT IS A BIG 
DEAL FOR ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE 
WORKING PERHAPS THEY LOSE DAYS OFF 
PEOPLE WORKING THEY LOSE THE MONEY 
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE EARNT FOR 
WORKING THAT DAY 
WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED 
SCHOOLS AFFECTED IN WEST YORKSHIRE 
ALONE THERE'LL BE MANY MORE 
BUSINESSES AND PARENT HOS ARE 
COUNTING THE COST OF TODAY'S 
PARENTS WHO ARE COUNTING THE COST 
OF TODAY'S STRIKE AS WE HAVE HEARD 
THEN JAMES YOU SAID IT IN YOUR 
REPORT TOO REALLY DIVIDING OPINION 
TODAY NOT JUST FROM THE MAIN 
POLITICAL PARTIES ALL OF WHOM ARE 
CONDEMNING THE NUT BUT E. MAILS 
AGAINST THE ACTION SOME TEACHERS 
MEMBERS OF THE NUT ITSELF NOT 
AGREEING WITH WHAT THEY HAVE DONE 
THAT IS RIGHT THE TEACHING 
PROFESSION AS A WHOLE IS DIVIDED 
OVER THIS STRIKE ACTION WHILE 
THERE IS GENUINE STRENGTH OF 
FEELING OVER PAY THERE IS IS A LOT 
OF UNHAPPINESS FROM OTHER PARTS OF 
THE PROFESSION OVER STRIKE ACTION 
ITSELF IS IT RIGHT TO STRIKE OVER 
PAY AND DISRUPT PARENTS AND 
CHILDRENS OTHERS WHO REPRESENT THE 
PROFESSION ARE AGAINST THE STRIKE 
ACTION 
BUT THE NUT SAYING THERE ACTION MAY BE FURTHER STRIKE ACTION THE THE NUT HAS NOT RULED OUT STRIKE ACTION 
THEIR CONFERENCE A MONTH AGO GAVE 
THEM A MANDATE A ROLLING PROGRAMME 
OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION SHOULD THIS 
DAY THIS STRIKE DAY PROVE 
SUCCESSFUL THEY HAVE NOT SAID 
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL DO THAT IT 
DOES RAISE THE DISTINCT POSSIBILITY 
OF A SUMMER OF DISCONTENT IN OUR 
SCHOOLS 
THANK YOU SCHOOLS THE TEACHERS' ACTION HAS COINCIDED 
WITH A SERIES OF STRIKE BY TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS

SATURDAY ALONG WITH HIS THIRTY NINE YEAR 
OLD MOTHER AND FULL TIME CARER HER

FROM THE FAMILY HOME SHE WAS FOUND 
WITH A LIGATURE AROUND HER NECK 
YESTERDAY WEST MERCIA POLICE 
ARRESTED A MAN AND A YOUTH ON 
SUSPICION OF THE MURDER OF JAMES 
THEY CONTINUE TO BE QUESTIONED IN 
REDDITCH AND KIDDERMINSTER THE 
POLICE ARE APPEALING FOR ANYONE 
WITH INFORMATION TO COME FORWARD 
AND THE INFORMATION THE POLICE 
REALLY NEED IS WHEN JAMES WAS LAST 
SEEN ALIVE L. HAVE BEEN TALKING TO 
NEIGHBOURS HERE IN THE AREA 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY IT IS CLEAR 
FROM THEM THAT JAMES WAS NOT SEEN 
OUT AND ABOUT REGULARLY HE SPENT 
MUCH OF HIS TIME IN HIS ROOM THEY 
ARE TRYING TO BUILD UP A PICTURE OF 
HIS AND HIS MOTHER'S LAST MOVEMENTS 
TO TRY AND DETERMINE WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED HERE 
YESTERDAY THE GOVERNMENT HEADED OFF 
A BACKBENCH REVOLT OVER ITS 
DECISION TO ABOLISH THE TEN P. TAX 
RATE WHICH REBEL M. P.'S SAID WOULD 
DISADVANTAGE THE POOREST PAID 
WORKERS THE GOVERNMENT PROMISED A 
COMPENSATION PACKAGE TO ALLAY THEIR 
CONCERNS ALREADY THERE IS 
CONFUSION AS TO WHAT THAT 
COMPENSATION WILL ENTAIL THE 
CONSERVATIVES SAY THE GOVERNMENT'S 
PROMISE IS UNRAVE VELING L. THINK 
MINISTERS DECIDED THEY HAD MANAGED 
TO HEAD OFF THIS POTENTIAL 
REBELLION BY THEIR BACKBENCHERS 
WHO ARE THREATENING TO VOTE AGAINST 
THE BUDGET BILL NEXT WEEK THE 
PACEMAKERAGE IS AGED AT PENSIONERS 
UNDER SIXTY FIVE AND LOW PAID PEOPLE 
WITHOUT CHILDREN THE GOVERNMENT 
WAS SPECIFIC ABOUT THE PENSIONERS 
UNDER SIXTY FIVE THEIR HELP WOULD BE 
BACKDATED THERE WAS NO TIMESCALE 
FOR THE OTHER GROUP LOW PAID 
PEOPLE WITHOUT CHILDREN REBELS 
SAY THE AGREEMENT THEY REACH IS 
CLEAR ALL THE ASSISTANCE WOULD BE 
BACK DATED THEY WERE THREATENING 
EARLIER ON TO PUT FRESH AMENDMENTS 
TO CLARIFY THAT POSITION TODAY IN 
THE COMMONS ALISTAIR DARLING SEEMED 
TO CLARIFY WHAT IS GOING ON PEOPLE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE TEN P. 
BAND ARE DESPERATE BECAUSE THEY ARE 
AFFECTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS IT 
WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT TO LOOK AT A RANGE OF 
MEASURES TO HELP THEM AS I SAY IN 
MY LETTER MY FOCUS IS TO ALLOW US 
TO OFFSET THE AVERAGE LOSSES FOR 
THEIR BAND FOR THIS YEAR THAT IS 
WHAT I INTEND TO DO 
AND THE KEY 
WORDS THERE ARE FOR THIS YEAR IN 
OTHER WORDS THOSE PEOPLE OUT OF 
POCKET FROM THIS YEAR THOSE LOW 
PAID WITHOUT CHILDREN SOME HELP 
WILL BE GIVEN TO THEM FOR THE MONEY 
THEY ARE LOSING AT THE MOMENT WE 
DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS OF WHAT THAT 
WILL BE WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO 
WAIT UNTIL THE AUTUMN AS THINGS 
STAND IT LOOKS LIKE MINISTERS MAY 
HAVE DONE JUST ABOUT ENOUGH

BUYING AS MOTORIST DIGEST THE NEWS 
THAT TALKS HAVE FAILED TO HEAD OFF 
THE GRANGEMOUTH STRIKE ELSEWHERE 
THERE HAS BEEN EVIDENCE OF SHORTAGE 
SPECIALLY IN SOME RURAL AREAS

CLOSURE OF GRANGEMOUTH SHOULDN'T 
LEAD TO AN IMMEDIATE FUEL CRISIS 
THERE ARE EIGHT OTHER REFINERIES IN 
THE U. K. THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO 
SUPPLY SCOTLAND AS WELL AS THE REST 
OF THE U. K. WE ALSO IMPORT FUEL 
READY FOR PRODUCTION AND GOING 
STRAIGHT INTO THE PUMPS THERE WILL

OUR TOP STORY THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLS 
HAVE CLOSED IN THE FIRST NATIONAL 
STRIKE BY TEACHERS IN ENGLAND AND 
WALES FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS COMING UP A 
PICTURE FOR POSTERITY WHY MORE AND 
MORE OF US ARE HAVING OUR PORTRAIT 
PAINTED LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON TWO 
THIRDS OF LONDON SCHOOLS CLOSE AS 
STRIKING TEACHERS TAKE TO THE 
STREETS OVER PAY AND CHILDREN 
AWAITING FOR ADOPTION STAR IN A NEW 
EXHIBITION OF PHOTOGRAPHS S. THAT AND AT 
NOW WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY NOW TALKING 
ABOUT PORTRAITS LATEST BIT OF 
INFORMATION HAS COME IN ON THE 
HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY IT CAME IN 
TODAY AND WAS AGAIN DISAPPOINTING 
SALES FELL BY OH FIVE PER CENT LAST MONTH THIS 
IS THE LATEST AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLESHOT FROM THE HIGH STREET 
AT A TIME OF INCREASING CONCERN 
ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH ON CONSUMER CONFIDENCE 
OFFICIAL FIGURES SHOW RETAIL SALES 
FELL BY OH FOUR PER CENT IN MARCH NON FOOD 
SHOPS AND DEPARTMENT STORES FARED 
THE WORSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
UNDERLYING TREND THINGS AREN'T AS 
GLOOMY SALES WERE UP TWO PER CENT OVER THE 
LAST THREE MONTHS EVEN SO IT'S 
CERTAINLY TOUGH OUT THERE FOR 
RETAILERS THEY WILL GO TO ANY 
LENGTH TO DRUM UP BUSINESS THESE 
DAYS ONE WELL KNOWN CHAIN HAS 
LAUNCHED A PRICE CUTTING INITIATIVE 
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS RIGHT 
NEXT DOOR A RIVAL DEPARTMENT STORE 
GROUP HAS COUNTERED WITH ITS OPEN 
PRICE CUTS GETTING CUSTOMERS 
THROUGH THE DOORS ISN'T EASY 
RISING HOUSEHOLD BILLS AND 
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
HAVEN'T HELP AND HIGH STREET STORES 
ARE FACING STRONG COMPETITION FROM 
INTERNET SALES THERE ARE 
REDICTIONS THAT SOME RETAIL LETTERS 
HAVE TO CUT BACK ON SPACE TO ADOPT 
TO THE TOUGHER CLIMATE 
THERE WILL BE GREAT DEAL OF 
CAUTION ABOUT WHILE THE PROPERTY 
INVESTMENT MARK RET MAINS DIFFICULT 
PEOPLE WILL THINK HARD BEFORE THEY 
COMMIT TO THE MASSIVE EXPENDITURE 
THAT IS INVOLVED IN BUILDING A 
SHOPPING CENTRE 
THE LATEST FIGURES 
SUGGEST SPENDING IN SHOPS IS 
HOLDING STEADY DESPITE THE NEWS 
IT'S HARD TO PREDICT AT WHAT POINT 
CONSUMERS' APPETITE FOR SHOP 
WILLING WAIN 
TODAY'S FIGURES HAVE FURTHER 
CONFIRMATION OF HOW DIFFICULT IT IS 
FOR RETAILERS PRICES WERE TWELVE PER CENT 
LOWER THAN LAST YEAR A BIGGER 
ANNUAL FALL THAN THE PREVIOUS MONTH 
SHOPS ARE OFFERING BARGAINS TO 
TEMPT CUSTOMERS 
THOUSANDS OF BANK CUSTOMERS MAY BE 
A STEP CLOSER TO BEING ABLE TO 
RECLAIM THE CHARGES THEY HAVE PAID 
FOR UNAUTHORISED OVERDRAFTS A HIGH 
COURT RULING HAS THE POWER TO 
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THE CHARGES 
LEVYED ARE FAIR LET'S TALK TO OUR 
CORRESPONDENT POTENTIALLY GOOD 
NEWS BUT THERE IS A LONG WAY TO G. 
THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO THIS 
CASE WAS ABOUT A PARTICULAR BIT OF 
CONSUMER LAW THE UNFAIR TERMS AND 
CONSUMER REGULATION CONTRACT THE 
ARGUMENT WAS WHETHER THOSE 
REGULATIONS APPLY TO BANK CHARGES 
OR NOT THE BANK SAID THEY DID AND 
THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING SAID 
THEY DIDN'T 
IT MEANS THAT PEOPLE CAN CHALLENGE 
THE BANKS IN THE COURT UNDER THE 
REGULATIONS SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN 
NEXT 
THE NEXT STEP IS THE OFFICE NEXT OF FAIR TRADING HAS ITS OWN 
INVESTIGATION RUNNING WHICH WILL 
DECIDE WHETHER BANK CHARMS ARE 
UNFAIR IT CAN USE THIS JUDGMENT WE 
HAVE HAD TODAY COUPLED ITS OWN 
INVESTIGATION IT CAN BRING THE TWO 
OF THOSE TOGETHER IN COURT AND 
FIGHT THEM OVER THE BANK CHARGES 
THIS JUDGMENT WAS A NECESSARY FIRST 
STEP FOR THAT TO HAPPEN IN THE 
FUTURE IF THE BANKS LOSE THAT CASE 
IF THAT HASED IN THE FUTURE AND 
THIS CASE TODAY THAT THEY HAVE LOST 
THEY CAN APPEAL BOTH OF THOSE 
THESE ARE IN THE HIGH COURT THEY 
CAN GO TO THE COURT OF APPEAL AND 
INTO THE HOUSE OF LORDS FOR THE 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MUCH PEOPLE 
WHO ARE WAITING TO FIND OUT IF THEY 
CAN CLAIM THEIR MONEY BACK IT 
COULD BE A WAIT OF MAYBE ONE OR TWO 
YEARS 
FIGURES OUT THIS MORNING YEARS SHOW THERE HAS BEEN A FALL IN CRIME 
IN ENGLAND AND WALES THE 
STATISTICS RELATE TO THE LAST THREE 
MONTHS OF TWEVE COMPARED WITH TWO THOUSAND SIX 
TWERCH TWO THOUSAND SEVEN COMPARED TO TWO THOUSAND SIX 
THERE IS ALWAYS QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW 
THEY ARE RECORDED PUT THEM IN 
CONTEXT 
THIS IS THE BIGGEST CONTEXT QUARTLY FALL SINCE THE NEW 
RECORDING METHODS WERE INTRODUCED 
SIX YEARS AGO THERES A BEEN A FALL 
OF TWELVE PER CENT OVERALL IN CRIME PARTICULAR 
CATEGORY WAS CRIME WE HAVE SEEN 
OVERALL ROBBERY DOWN TWENTY ONE PER CENT VIOLENCE 
DOWN TWENTY ONE PER CENT AS WELL QUITE 
CONSIDERABLE FALL THERE IS IS ONE 
EXCEPTION 
IT'S NOT ALL GOOD NEWS EXCEPTION THERE IS ANOTHER NATIONAL SURVEY OF 
HOSPITAL DATA SHOWING VIOLENCE 
AGAINST BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN 
ALMOST DOUBLED THAT IS A SEPARATE 
REPORT BUT ACCORDING TO THIS 
REPORT DRUG 
CRIME IS UP DRUG DRUG CRIME IS UP TWENTY PER CENT THE REASON FOR 
THAT IS MAYBE THE POLICE ARE 
HANDING OUT MORE WARNINGS ON THE 
STREETS DUE TO CANNABIS USE THERE 
IS MAYBE MORE PEOPLE BEING CAUGHT 
WITH CLASS A DRUG AS WELL THERE IS 
ALSO BAD NEWS ON FIREARMS 
COMPARING YEAR LAST YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
AND TWO THOUSAND SIX FIREARMS OFFENCES RUN FOUR PER CENT 
ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE V. HAVE DIED AS A RESULT OF GUN 
CRIME AND SERIOUS INJURES IS DOWN 
ON THE PREVIOUS YEAR 
RAIL TRAVEL 
MAY NOT BE GETTING CHEAPER BUT 
FARES ARE GETTING SIMPLER TRAIN 
OPERATORS SCRAPPING A WHOLE RANGE 
OF TICKETS THEY SAY CONFUSE THE 
CUSTOMER THEY ANNOUNCING A NEW 
STRUCTURE WHICH JUST THREE TYPES OF 
TICKET IF YOUR JOB IS HELPING 
CONFUSED RAIL PASSENGERS YOU NEED 
TO KNOW YOUR TICKETS THERE ARE 
MORE THAN A DOZEN TRAIN COMPANIES 
ALL WITH THEIR OWN SPECIAL FARES 
THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE TICKET 
TYPES AVAILABLE ON BRITAIN'S 
RAILWAYS TODAY 
PASSENGERS HAVE TO WAY UP PRICE 
TRAVEL TIMES WHETHER OR NOT THEY 
MIGHT CANCEL NO WONDER THEY ARE 
CONFUSED 
THERE IS EIGHT OF US SO IT'S A 
NETWORK SAVER GROUP SAVER IT'S 
NOT STRAIGHT FORWARD L. HAVE 
SOMEONE WHO WORKS AT THE STATION SO 
I GET THEM TO DO THE DONGY WORK I I FIND THEM IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND 
THEM IF I DO SOMETHING OTHER THAN 
MY ISSUE JOURNEY L. FEEL SORRY FOR 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE JUST ARRIVED IN THE 
COUNTRY FOR A ONE OFF PASSENGERS PASSENGERS DO LIKE VARIED FARES IF IT MEANS 
CHEAPER TRAVEL BUT NOT GETTING 
CONFUSED CONFUSED CHEAP DEALS AND LOWER RAIL FAYES 
HAVE IN MANY CASES RESULTED IN HIGH 
GROWTH BUT THERE HAS TO BE A 
BALANCE WE HAVE RECOGNISED WE HAD 
GOT TO THE POSITION WHERE THERE 
WERE TOO MANY RAIL FARES 
SO NOW 
THERE WILL BE THREE 
THE ADVANCE FARES WILL ALL BE NON 
REFUNDABLE FROM NEXT MONTH SOME 
OPERATORS WILL NO LONGER BUT EVEN 
THOUGH THEY ARE CHANGING THE NAMES 
OF THE TICKETS THEY ARE NOT MAKING 
RAIL TRAVEL ANY CHEAPER IT'S 
GOVERNMENT POLICY TO MAKE FARE 
PAYERS PAY MORE SO THAT TAXPAYERS 
PAY LESS TOM SYMONDS B. B. C. NEWS

PAUL BECKETT AMATEUR HEAVY BOXER 
MASEUR AND PERHAPS MOST 
SURPRISINGLY 
I AM A LAWYER IT'S SURPRISINGLY ONLY WHAT I DO FROM NINE TO FIVE OR 
USUALLY EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY THE ART 
THE BODY ART REPRESENTS THE 
FRAGILITY OF YOUTH AND BEAUTY AND 
STRENGTH IT SPEAKS GREAT VOLUMES 
TO ME AND THAT THOSE WHO 
OCCASIONALLY SEE IT L. HAD NO IDEA 
AS MANY PEOPLE WERE GRG TO SEE IT 
AS WERE GOING TO SEE IT 
THERE IS 
SOMETHING MORE COMPELLING ABOUT 
SELF PORTRAITS HE PAINT THIS WITH 
PHOTOGRAPHS AND MIRRORS 
PORTRAITS DO GIVE A DESCRIPTION AND 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAY WE ARE IN 
A WAY THAT PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEOS DON'T 
WHILE IT'S DIFFICULT TO DON'T ACCOUNT FOR WHY MORE AND MORE 
PEOPLE WANT THEIR PORTRAITS PAINTED 
THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT 
INCREASE IN COMMISSIONS SO IF YOU

WOULD RATHER THE ONES MY NEPHEWS DO 
FOR ME IMAGINE POPPING INTO YOUR 
KITCHEN AND COMING FACE TO FACE 
WITH THIS AN EIGHT FOOT LONG 
ALLIGATOR THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO 
A PENSIONER IN FLORIDA IT'S

THE KITCHEN SMACKING CROCKERY AS 
IT WENT FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS 
INJURED LET'S SEE IF THE WEATHER 
HAS SOME BITE 
IT CERTAINLY DOES SOME THUNDER 
AROUND THE WEATHER HAS BEEN 
SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY MORNING RAIN 
AND NOW A BETTER AFTERNOON BUT NOT 
NECESSARILY MUCH BETTER FOR A 
NUMBER OF US WE HAVE SOME BIG 
SHOWER CLOUDS LURKING AROUND ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY HERE IS THE BAND OF 
CLOUD AND RAIN THAT HAS BEEN 
SWEEPING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN THE 
LAST FEW HOURS BRIGHTER SKIES 
BEHIND YOU WILL NOTICE THESE 
CLUSTER OF SHOWERS FOR THE SECOND 
HALF OF THE DAY THE PERSISTENT RAIN 
CLEARS INTO THE NORTH SEA THEN WE 
ARE LEFT WITH THE SHOWERS CRACKS OF 
THUNER STILL TO COME IT'S NOT ALL 
DOOM AND GLOOM THERE IS DRY 
WEATHER IN BETWEEN THE SHOWERS 
TEMPERATUREING GETTING UP TO AROUND 
ABOUT FOURTEEN AGREES IT DOES FEEL 
FRESHER THAN YESTERDAY NOT JUST 
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SHOWERS BUT 
BECAUSE WE HAVE THAT MUCH MORE OF A 
BREEZE COMING IN OFF THE ATLANTIC 
FROM THE WEST OR SOUTH WEST NOT A 
NICE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY ACROSS 
WALES COMPARED TO YESTERDAY MORE 
CLOUD AND SOME SHOWERS THE SHOWERS 
ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST AND THE WEST 
COUNTRY CERTAINLY NOT AS WIDESPREAD 
OR AS HEAVY AS EVERYWHERE ELSE 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO AS WE GET 
INTO THE EVENING HOURS THE LAST OF 
THE SHOWERS WILL DIE AWAY THEY MAY 
STICK AROUND UNTIL AT LEAST EIGHT HUNDRED P. M. 
IN THE EVENING THEN OVERNIGHT 
IT'S A STORY OF CLEAR SPELLS ALMOST 
EVERYWHERE ACROSS THE COUNTRY APART 
FROM A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS IN THE 
WESTERN ISLES THE TOP TEMPERATURE 
OR THE LOWEST TEMPERATURE WE WILL 
SEE ACROSS THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY 
WILL BE NINE DEGREES FURTHER 
NORTHWARDS AROUND THREE DEGREES IN 
MURRAY AND ABERDEEN SHR THAT TAKE 
US ON TO TOMORROW MORNING FOR THE 
EARLY BIRDS A LOT OF SUNSHINE IN 
THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY HOWEVER 
THROUGH THE MIDMORNING AND TOWARDS 
LUNCHTIME IT TURNS THROUGH NORTHERN 
IRELAND IT STARTS TO RAIN HERE 
RAIN GETS INTO SCOTLAND AND PARTS 
OF WESTERN BRITAIN AS WELL HOWEVER 
THE BEST OF THE WEATHER WILL BE 
RESERVED FOR THE SOUTH OF THE U. K. 
HOW ABOUT THE WEEKEND WELL IT'S 
SPLIT FORTUNE SOME RAIN AND SOME 
SUNSHINE SOUNDS LIKE I AM HEDGING 
MY BETS BUT THAT IS WHAT WE WILL 
SEE FOR EXAMPLE ACROSS THE SOUTH 
OF THE U. K. YOUR BEST BET FOR THE 
DRY WEATHER IS SATURDAY WARM AS 
WELL IN LONDON POSSIBLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON 
SUNDAY IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL SEE 
INCREASING CLOUD AND SOME SPOTS OF 
RAIN HOW ABOUT THE NORTH OF THE U. K. 
NOT SO GOOD HERE MORE CLOUD SOME 
OUTBREAKS OF RAIN FOR EXAMPLE IN 
HULL IT MAY BE DRY ON SATURDAY 
OVERALL THE WEEKEND IS LOOKING LIKE
