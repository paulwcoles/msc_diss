ADOPT CERTIFICATE STRICT BUILDING 
CODES AFTER THE ONE NINE SEVEN SIX SEVEN EARTHQUAKE 
WHICH KILLED A TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE 
MODERN BUILDINGS SHOULDN'T GO DOWN 
BUT IT IS EASY TO SKIMP ON THE 
BUILDING REGULATIONS YOU NEED 
BUILDING CONTROL AND EXPERT EASE TO 
ENSURE THAT BUILDINGS ARE 
CONSTRUCTED ACCORDING TO THE CODE 
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HAPPENING 
AMID THE OVERWHELMING HORROR A FEW 
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE STILL BEING PULLED

RESCUERS SOME REWARD TO SET AGAINST 
THE RELENTLESS TRAGEDY OF 
RECOVERING THE DEAD I'M FINE SHE 
SAYS CHINA'S HOUSING MINISTER SAYS 
THE SHEER SCALE OF THIS EARTHQUAKE 
WENT FAR BEYOND THE DESIGNED 
RESISTANCE OF BUILDINGS IN THE 
REGION BUT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE 
HAS DAMAGED THE REPUTATION OF 
BRITISH FOOTBALL IN EUROPE NEXT 
WEEK IT IS THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
FINAL CHELSEA AGAINST MANCHESTER 
UNITED IN MOSCOW AN EVEN BIGGER 
NIGHT FOR FOOTBALL ON THE PITCH AND 
OFF IT 
DESPITE THE THREAT OF PILOT STRIKES 
BIG INCREASES IN THE COST OF FUEL 
AND THE DISASTROUS OPENING OF 
HEATHROW'S TERMINAL FIVE BRITISH 
AIRWAYS MADE PRE TAX PROFITS OF 
NEARLY NINE HUNDRED BILLION IN THE LAST 
FINANCIAL YEAR THAT'S AN INCREASE 
OF FORTY FIVE PER CENT ON THE YEAR BEFORE OUR 
TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT TOM SYMONDS 
IS AT HEATHROW 
AFTER THE BAD NEWS 
IN THESE PARTS BRITISH AIRWAYS 
WILL HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH ITS 
RESULTS THIS MORNING THE RECORD 
PROFIT THE PAYOUTS TO SHAREHOLDERS 
AND THE BOSS WILLIE WALSH NOT 
TAKING HIS BONUS FOLLOWING THE 
PROBLEMATIC OPENING OF TERMINAL FIVE 
HE ARGUED STRONGLY THIS MORNING 
THAT THE AIRLINE IS STRONG ENOUGH 
TO WEATHER THE COMING STORM IN THIS 
THE AVIATION INDUSTRY OH WHAT A 
YEAR BRITISH AIRWAYS AND WILLIE 
WALSH HAVE SEEN IT ALL IN THE LAST 
TWELVE MONTHS FROM A DRAMATIC AIR 
CRASH MIRACULOUSLY WITHOUT 
FATALITIES TO A CONVICTION FOR 
COLLUSION AND PRICE FIXING TO THE 
GLITTERING PROMPTS AND DISASTROUS 
DEBUT OF TERMINAL FIVE THIS MORNING 
B. A.'S NEW HOME WAS FUNCTIONING WELL 
A HUGE LEAP IN PROFITS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE 
MILLION BEEN TAX BUT THERE IS 
ANOTHER 
AMOUNT B. A. SPENT ON 
FUEL SO HOW HAS THE AIRLINE DONE 
IT IT'S PASSED ON TO PASSENGERS 
SOME OF THE COST OF THAT FUEL IT'S 
CARRYING MORE OF THEM ESPECIALLY 
IN THE FRONT END OF THE PLANE MORE 
CARGO AND IT'S CUT COSTS BUT 
WILLIE WALSH ADMITTED THE SERVICE 
NEED TO DO IMPROVE 
WE LOOK BACK ON 
THE WHOLE YEAR AND SAY WHAT LESSONS 
CAN WE LEARN WHAT'S CAN WE DO 
BETTER WHAT ARE WE DETERMINED TO 
ADDRESS AND DELIVER BETTER SERVICE 
TO OUR CUSTOMER THIS IS YEAR HE HE STILL HAS TO FULLY OPEN TERMINAL FIVE 
BUT FEEN THAT GOES WELL THE 
AIRLINE'S FUEL BILL WILL RISE 
FURTHER RESULT B. A.'S CHIEF 
PREDICTS RIVAL ALSO GO BUST AND 
FARE ALSO RISE INDUSTRY WATCHERS 
SAYS B. A. HAS TO PREPARE FOR 
DIFFICULT TIMES TOO 
THE WHOLE 
INDUSTRY IS FACED WITH RISING COST 
OF FUEL BRITISH AIRWAYS SAYS THAT 
COULD PUT ITS COSTS UP BY ONE 
BILLION IN THE YEAR AHEAD WE SEE 
GENERAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND 
INCREASING COMPETITION FOR BRITISH 
AIRWAYS PARTICULARLY ON ROUTES TO 
NORTH AMERICA 
AS FOR WILLIE WALSH 
DIFFICULT TIMES MAY BE AHEAD BUT 
HE IS INTENT ON STAYING IN HIS 
HIGH PRESSURE JOB 
IN THE LAST HOUR WE HAVE BEEN ABLE 
TO ASK PASSENGERS ABOUT WILLIE 
WALSH'S LACK OF BONUS AND THE 
GENERAL REACTION HAS BEEN NICE 
GESTURE FROM ONE PASSENGER 
ANOTHER WANTED THE MONEY BACK IN 
CHEAPER FIRST

BURMA'S DISASTER ZONE MUD 
WRECKAGE AND STILL BARELY A HINT OF 
OUTSIDE HELP TWO WEEKS AFTER THE 
CYCLONE THE ONLY HOUSE LEFT FROM A 
WHOLE VILLAGE THE SURVIVORS HERE 
NOT STARVING YET BUT WAITING

TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS HUGE AREA 
IN ATROCIOUS CONDITIONS 
FLOODWATERS STILL AROUND HEAVY 
RAIN EVERY DAY BRIDGES WHICH ARE 
IMPASSABLE AND BAD ROADS 
BUT THE 
PROBLEMS AREN'T JUST LOGISTICAL 
BURMA'S PRIME MINISTER TOUR AS 
GOVERNMENT CAMP HE CLAIMED THE 
INITIAL EMERGENCY STAGE OF THIS 
DISASTER WAS OVER THAT 
RECONSTRUCTION WORK WAS THE 
PRIORITY BUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS 
STILL BEGGING THE MILITARY TO OPEN 
UP AND ALLOW IN FOREIGN TEAMS AND 
MUCH MORE AID 
THE MAIN PROBLEM 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT IS THEY DO NOT 
ACCEPT INTERNATIONAL HELP WE WOULD 
LIKE TO HAVE SOME INTERNATIONAL 
STAFF WE DON'T NEED AN INVAIRKS 
JUST A FEW PEOPLE TO ACCORD NIGHT 
PEOPLE WITH EXPERIENCE GFRPLTS 
SLOWLY MORE HELP IS REACHING THOSE 
WHO NEED IT BUT NO ONE SEEMS TO 
KNOW HOW MANY DIED OR EXACTLY WHERE 
ALL THE SURVIVORS ARE SHELTERING 
IT IS A CHAOTIC AND WRETCHED 
SITUATION SITUATION OUR TOP STORY THIS LUNCH TIME

UNIQUE FLY PAST 
SIXTY FIVE YEARS ON AND THE LANCASTER 
BOMBER IS BACK IN THE SKIES OVER A

MOST RIVER 
CAM FERRET OUT THESE ADDRESSES ANY 
WEIGHT AND 
THE HOUSE
