MRS. NEIL'S OWN WORDS I'M AMAZED SEVENTY EIGHT THINGS 
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WILL YOU SWAP FOR DAZ GRAVY 
COMMERCIALS ARE AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN CHIEFLY AIMED AT WOMEN 
THEIR CHOICES MAKE AND BREAK HOUSEHOLD BRANDS 
THE PROBLEM FOR ADVERTISERS IS HOW TO SPEAK TO THEM HOW TO PERSUADE 
THIS WOMAN IS ALONE YET NOT ALONE 
EVEN THOUGH HER FAMILY MAY BE APART FROM HER THEY ARE STILL A PART OF HER 
BEING JUDGED BY THE CARE SHE TAKES OF THEM 
BEING JUDGED BY HOW CLEAN AND WHITE SHE KEEPS HER CLOTHES 
SHE IS JUDGED BY THAT WHITENESS 
SO PERSIL IS PART OF HER STRENGTH AND THEIR HAPPINESS 
AS A WIFE SHE USES PERSIL AS A MOTHER SHE USES PERSIL 
PERSIL WASHES WHITER 
THE PERSIL MUM OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES DIDN'T ABANDON HER FAMILY AT THE GARDEN GATE 
SHE LITERALLY CLOTHED THEM WITH A PROTECTIVE SHIELD OF LOVE 
WHICH OTHER MOTHERS DIDN'T PROVIDE 
ALTHOUGH HOME WAS A MORAL ENTITY IT WAS STILL A PHYSICAL ONE WITH FOUR WALLS 
AND MUM WAS GENERALLY INSIDE THEM LOOKING OUT 
MUM SITTING AT HOME LOOKING AFTER HER FAMILY 
FILLED WITH A SENSE OF PRIDE BECAUSE SHE'D DONE HER JOB WELL 
IN GIVING HER FAMILY THE WHITEST WASH AND MAKING THEM LOOK GOOD 
THIS WAS THE IDEAL HOMAGE TO THE HEARTH AND ITS GUARDIAN THE HOMEMAKER 
THE REBUILDING OF POST WAR BRITAIN HAD TO START AT HOME THE ALTERNATIVES WERE UNTHINKABLE 
THROUGHOUT THE NINETEEN FORTIES WOMEN HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO AN EFFECTIVE PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN 
WHICH TOLD THEM HOW USEFUL THEY WERE AS LAND GIRLS AND MUNITIONS WORKERS 
AFTER THE WAR THEY WERE PUSHED BACK INTO THE HOME 
A NEW CAMPAIGN WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE WOMEN FEEL BETTER ABOUT THAT 
THE ADVERTISERS STEPPED IN TO FILL THIS GAP 
BUT ADVERTISERS WENT FURTHER THAN JUST SAYING THAT THEY WERE IMPORTANT 
THEY CREATED A CULT OF MOTHERHOOD 
THIS IS LAURA DAVIS SOMETIMES SHE THINKS SHE LEADS A HUMDRUM LIFE 
BUT SHE WOULDN'T CHANGE PLACES WITH ANYONE 
ADVERTISING AND REALITY WERE NOT TOO FAR APART BECAUSE BEING A GOOD WIFE WAS THE PRIME CAREER 
THERE WERE TIPS IN MAGAZINES ON HOW TO CREATE LITTLE OBJECTS OUT OF OLD CURTAINS 
AND BEING A GOOD WIFE WAS IMPORTANT IN THE EYES OF OTHER PEOPLE 
IF YOUR TERRY NAPPIES WERE GREYER THAN NEXT DOOR'S 
THIS WAS A SIGN THAT YOU WEREN'T DOING YOUR JOB 
HIS WIFE SENDS HIM OFF TO WORK 
GOOD JOB SHE DIDN'T SEE HIM TWO HOURS LATER 
YOU SAID TODAY WHERE IS THAT SCHEDULE 
YOU DIDN'T COMPLETE IT I CAN'T WAIT HIS WIFE'S FAULT REALLY 
NO PROPER BREAKFAST HE SAID HE HADN'T TIME NONSENSE 
BEFORE HIS TOAST AND TEA GIVE HIM CORNFLAKES DELICIOUS 
THEN HIS WIFE NEEDN'T WORRY 
THAT'S FINE MR. WATKINS 
I'LL TAKE THAT FIVE HUNDRED TODAY 
GOODBYE 
THAT'S O. K. MR. WATKINS NOT AT ALL 
REMIND ME TO TAKE SOME FLOWERS HOME TO MY WIFE 
WOMEN IN THAT PERIOD FEARED FAILURE 
AND THEY ALSO FEARED THE CRITICISM OF OTHER WOMEN 
THERE WAS ALWAYS THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR WHO KNEW BETTER THAN YOU 
SHE'D BE THERE WITH A CRITICISM IN HER EYES IF NOT HER VOICE 
WOMEN WERE CONSTANTLY TURNING THIS CRITICISM TO GUILT AND WHIPPING THEMSELVES ON 
EARLY ADVERTISING FOR FROZEN FOOD HAD TO STEER A CLEVER PATH 
HOW ABOUT SOME BIRDS EYE FISH SO FRESH 
THE STARTLING THING ABOUT FROZEN FOOD WHEN IT WAS FIRST SOLD 
WAS THAT IT WASN'T SOLD ON CONVENIENCE 
TO SELL IT BY CONVENIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO SUGGEST THAT IT WAS A SUBSTITUTE FOOD 
AND DENIGRATE THE HOUSEWIFE'S ROLE 
SHE HAD TO KEEP HER POSITION OF PROVIDER 
THIS WAS ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE THIRTY PER CENT OF MARRIED WOMEN WHO WORKED 
BIRDS EYE FOUND WAYS OF OVERCOMING THEIR GUILT AT USING CONVENIENCE FOODS 
WE BOTH WORK SO WE OFTEN HAVE A BIRDS EYE PIE 
IT'S SO NICE BEING ABLE TO BAKE IT YOURSELF 
IT REALLY BRINGS OUT THE FLAVOUR 
THEY STRESSED THAT YOUR BAKING GAVE IT THAT HOME BAKED QUALITY 
SO THE HOUSEWIFE IMMEDIATELY HAD A REASON TO BE INVOLVED 
BUT THERE WAS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE REAL THING 
ON THE DAY JANE WAS WED DOUBT CREPT INTO HER HEAD 
NEVER FEAR COOKEEN IS HERE 
SUCH ANXIETIES DEMONSTRATED THE IMPORTANCE OF BAKING 
BUT THERE WERE NEW SOLUTIONS 
A COMPLETE CAKE MIX WAS DEVELOPED THAT NEEDED NOTHING ADDED TO IT 
SOUNDED A GOOD IDEA IT WOULD SAVE THE HOUSEWIFE TIME 
BUT BECAUSE SHE WASN'T ABLE TO INCLUDE ANYTHING FOR HERSELF THE CAKE MIXES DID NOT SELL 
SO THE MANUFACTURERS SAID ADD YOUR OWN EGG 
BY ADDING AN EGG SHE FELT SHE WAS MAKING HER CONTRIBUTION 
MARKETING SOLUTIONS SUCH AS THESE WERE CHAMPIONED BY ERNEST DICKTER AMERICAN ADVERTISING GURU 
HERE'S A NEW KIND OF SANDWICH FUZZY WUZZIES 
MADE WITH KRAFT DAIRYLEA 
CUT THE CRUSTS FROM A SANDWICH LOAF AND SPREAD IT WITH DAIRYLEA 
CUT THE SLICE TO FORM A RECTANGLE REMOVE THE CRUSTS 
AND SPREAD AGAIN THIS TIME WITH LEMON CURD 
SCATTER WITH COCONUT AND CUT DIAGONALLY 
FORMING THESE DIAMOND SHAPES 
THEY'LL GIVE YOUR TEA TABLE AN EXTRA SPARKLE 
EVEN PROCESSED CHEESE WAS SOLD NOT FOR ITS CONVENIENCE BUT ON VERSATILITY 
THE WONDERFUL THINGS YOU COULD DO WITH IT 
UNDER THE GRILL THEY GO TOMATO CHUTNEY IN THE CENTRE AND HOORAY 
SUNSHINE SUSIES FOR SUPPER 
BUT THE REAL BATTLE FACING HOUSEWIVES WAS CLEANING 
IT TOOK UP MOST OF THEIR TIME AND THEY EXPECTED IT TO BE HARD 
FIFTIES ADVERTISING CELEBRATED THIS STOICISM 
MEET MRS. NASH OF MERTHYR TYDFIL 
I'VE ALWAYS USED PURITAN BECAUSE IT'S THE NICEST SOAP THAT YOU CAN BUY 
HOW DO YOU GET THE BEST RESULTS WITH PURITAN PLENTY OF HOT SOAPY WATER AND ELBOW GREASE 
BUT BY THE EARLY SIXTIES THE HARD WORK WAS REJECTED FOR A NEW CHAMPION 
MODERNITY 
CLEAN MY HOME THE MODERN WAY AND THE MODERN WAY IS BRIGHT AND GAY 
WITH THE MODERN SOAP PURITAN HOORAY 
THE MODERN WAY IS BRIGHT AND GAY 
WITH THE MODERN SOAP PURITAN HOORAY 
PURITAN 
PURITAN PURITAN THE MODERN HOME SOAP 
THE ADVERTISERS WERE BRINGING THE GOOD NEWS FOR WOMEN 
ONLY THEIR PRODUCT WOULD SAVE TIME 
HERE'S NEW BLUE VIM 
NEW BLUE VIM SO WONDERFULLY SMOOTH AND KIND TO MY HANDS 
NEW BLUE VIM IS MY CHOICE IT GETS AT THE GERMS YOU CAN'T SEE 
THE WAY NEW BLUE VIM LATHERS IS SIMPLY MARVELLOUS GREASE AND STAINS JUST VANISH 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT NEW BLUE VIM IS THE LOVELY SMELL 
LIKE SPRING FLOWERS CHEERS YOU UP WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE HOUSEWORK 
I THINK NEW BLUE VIM'S GRAND 
LOOK AT THE CANISTER SO BRIGHT NO NEED TO HIDE IT EASY TO OPEN 
NEW BLUE VIM THE UP TO DATE CLEANSER 
HOUSEWORK CHANGED A LOT NEW GADGETS AND CLEANING FLUIDS MADE IT AN EASIER TASK 
SO WE INCREASED OUR STANDARDS INSTEAD OF JUST LOOKING CLEAN IT HAD TO SMELL CLEAN 
INSTEAD OF JUST FEEDING THE FAMILY YOU HAD TO TITILLATE THEIR PALATES 
SO WHILST HOUSEWORK BECAME EASIER THE STANDARDS WERE BROUGHT HIGHER 
AND MORE PRODUCTS WERE NEEDED 
OF THE MANY HIGH STANDARDS WHICH A HOUSEWIFE HAD TO REACH 
ONE HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRE EMINENT 
TALK ABOUT WHITENESS WHITE CAN BE EVEN WHITER SUCH WHITENESS WHITE STRENGTH 
WHITER ALL THE WAY THROUGH THAT IMPORTANT BIT WHITER 
DOUBLE WHITENING POWER WHITER FOR JOE WHITER FOR MARY 
MARY OH YOU'LL NEED THESE 
SUNGLASSES 
NEW SUNSHINE RINSO WITH SUNSHINE WHITENERS 
PUT RINSO SUNSHINE IN YOUR MACHINE 
DO ALL YOUR WASHING WITH RINSO SUNSHINE 
SUNSHINE WHITENERS SUNSHINE BRIGHTENERS RINSO CLEAN 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THE WHITENESS OF YOUR WASH IMPORTANT QUESTION 
IT WASN'T JUST THE HOUSEWIFE'S STANDARDS IT WAS HER MORAL FIBRE THAT WAS BEING JUDGED 
WHITENESS IS A DIMENSION ACTUALLY OF CLEANNESS 
WHITENESS REPRESENTS SOMETHING ADDED 
DIRT IS SYMBOLIC OF ALL KINDS OF THINGS 
THE QUESTION IS WHY DO WOMEN HAVE SO MANY RITUALS CONCERNING IT 
CLEANLINESS IS NEXT TO GODLINESS AND WHITENESS IS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF CLEANLINESS 
SO WHITENESS IN THAT SENSE IS AN IMPORTANT SYMBOLIC PSYCHOLOGICAL UNDERPINNING 
YOU WERE TRYING TO PROVE THAT YOU WERE SOMEBODY WHO TOOK DIRT SERIOUSLY AND GOT RID OF IT 
IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE THESE IDEALS 
AND THE ADVERTISERS PLAYED ON THIS ANXIETY 
ONE HAS TO RECOGNISE THAT DIRT WASN'T ALL THE SAME 
SOME DIRT WAS RELATIVELY INNOCENT 
BUT THERE WAS THE PROBLEM DIRT THAT WAS DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS 
LUVIL TAKES OUT THE WICKEDEST STAINS 
BUT THE GREATEST THREAT CAME FROM THE DIRT YOU COULDN'T SEE 
AS WELL AS NEEDING A NEW ROLE AFTER THE WAR WOMEN ALSO NEEDED A NEW ENEMY 
AND GERMS REPLACED GERMANS AS THAT ENEMY 
THE TOILET BECAME THAT UNGUARDED ENTRANCE INTO ALL THAT WE HOLD DEAR 
THERE'S A LOT OF JOBS YOU DON'T MUCH ENJOY DOING 
BUT THEY'VE GOT TO BE DONE 
AS THE GUARDIAN OF THE FAMILY'S HEALTH 
CLEANING THE TOILET WAS MOST IMPORTANT 
IN A CONSUMER GROUP IF ONE LADY SAYS SHE CLEANS HER TOILET TWICE A DAY 
EVERYONE ELSE WILL SAY THE SAME THEY'D BE LYING 
WHAT SHOULD A TOILET CLEANER DO 
I LOOK FOR SOMETHING THAT SMELLS NICE AND GETS IT REALLY CLEAN 
DESTROYS ALL THE GERMS 
CLEANS THE PAN COMPLETELY 
ONE LADY TOLD ME THAT BEFORE SHE'D TAKE TEA IN SOMEBODY'S HOUSE 
SHE'D CHECK HOW CLEAN THE LOO WAS 
IF IT WAS SPARKLING SHE'D HAVE TEA 
VIEWING RESTRICTIONS LED TO A LOAD OF VERBAL EUPHEMISMS 
NICE TO SEE THEM LOOKING WELL IT'S WORTH BEING PARTICULAR ABOUT THINGS 
I REMEMBER WORKING MANY YEARS AGO ON A LAVATORY CLEANSER CALLED DOT 
FUNNY NAME FOR A LAVATORY POWDER 
IT WAS IN A REVOLUTIONARY NEVER SEEN BEFORE PACK 
JUST TWIST AND SQUEEZE 
THE POWDER WENT INTO ALL THOSE UNSPEAKABLE PLACES WHICH WE HAD BEEN TOLD NOT TO TALK ABOUT 
BUT TO SAVE THE BRITISH PUBLIC FROM EMBARRASSMENT 
THE COMMERCIAL COULDN'T BE SHOWN BEFORE NINE P. M. 
AND EVEN THEN TO SAVE THE ADULTS 
YOU COULD ONLY SHOW IT BEING TIPPED DOWN 
INTO WHAT WAS PRESUMABLY A LOO BUT YOU NEVER SAW IT 
REGULATIONS THEN AND TO AN EXTENT NOW WERE LUDICROUS 
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP THE LURID COMMUNICATION OF THE FEAR OF WHAT LURKED BELOW 
DOMESTOS EVEN HIRED ORSON WELLES TO VOICE A NEW HORROR FILM 
IN EVERY HOME YOUR HOME GERMS LURK UNSEEN 
BREEDING MULTIPLYING 
WIPE THEM OUT WITH DOMESTOS DOMESTOS KILLS ALL KNOWN GERMS 
DEAD 
PRESENTING THE NEW HOOVER JUNIOR 
MILITARY MARCH IN THE WAR AGAINST DIRT 
THE MODERN HOUSEWIFE COULD DRAW FROM AN ARSENAL OF NEW TECHNOLOGY 
ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES PROMISED TO MAKE HOUSEWORK SOMETHING IT HAD NEVER BEEN EASY 
BUT THERE WAS STILL A PROBLEM MY WIFE IS CONFUSED I'M CONFUSED TOO 
THESE ITEMS COULDN'T BE PAID FOR OUT OF THE HOUSEKEEPING 
SO ADVERTISING WAS PITCHED AT HIM AS MUCH AS HER 
BECAUSE HE HAD TO PAY 
BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT WASHING TO SAY ANYTHING 
ARE YOU GOING TO WASH SHEETS WE'D LIKE TO 
THE SERVIS SUPERTWIN TAKES SHEETS EASILY PERSIL KEEPS THEM WHITE 
BUT HE WAS REMINDED THAT HE HAD SOMETHING TO GAIN FROM THIS NEW MACHINE 
IS YOUR WIFE STILL PUTTING UP WITH THIS 
OR DOES YOUR WIFE PROUDLY OWN A NEW HOOVER SPINNER RINSE 
IF THAT STILL DIDN'T TEMPT HIM HOOVER GAVE HER THE FINAL LESSON IN THE ART OF PERSUASION 
AND I WANT A WASHING MACHINE 
WE'LL GET ONE FROM THE FACTORY 
I WANT TO GO TO THE SHOP AND CHOOSE ONE YOU'RE RIGHT 
WHAT SHE GOT WAS A TOP LOADER BUT ALTHOUGH IT BEAT SCRUBBING IT STILL INVOLVED HER 
IRONICALLY A SURFEIT OF TWIN TUBS MADE BRITISH WIVES AMONG THE LAST TO BENEFIT FROM THE AUTOMATIC 
HEARD THE NEWS GOING ROUND 
HOOVER HAVE GONE AND FOUND THE WASHING MACHINE THAT MEANS THE END OF WASH DAY FORGET IT 
SEE THE MOST ADVANCED WASHING MACHINE EVER MADE 
MY NAME IS HERBERT HOOVER 
OUR COMPANY HAS JUST PRODUCED SOMETHING SO EXCITING 
IN EARLY T. V. ADVERTISING WOMEN WERE ADDRESSED MOSTLY BY EXPERTS 
THEY SPOKE WITH AUTHORITY WHICH WAS LARGELY A MALE VIRTUE 
WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT PERSIL'S GOOD IN WASHING MACHINES 
IT OVERCOMES THAT FEELING 
HERE'S SOME REALLY GOOD NEWS 
WE RECOMMEND NEW PERSIL 
VIEWERS WERE BEGINNING TO LOOK AND SAY WHY IS THAT MAN TELLING ME THAT 
COOKEEN GIVES YOU THE GOLDEN TOUCH WHY SHOULD HE KNOW BETTER 
THE ONLY WAY TO BUY YOUNG BEANS 
WHO THE HELL IS HE ALL GOODNESS ELEVEN YARD OF TAPE 
THE EXPERTS' HEYDAY WAS OVER 
THEIR LANGUAGE WAS NO LONGER A PASSPORT TO CREDIBILITY 
AND THEY CERTAINLY KNEW LESS ABOUT HOUSEWORK THAN WOMEN 
DO THEY KEEP ALL RIGHT OH YES 
IT MADE MORE SENSE TO LET HOUSEWIVES TELL EACH OTHER 
A NEW DEVICE KNOWN AS TWO TARTS IN THE KITCHEN 
LEFT THE EXPERTS WITH BIT PARTS 
EVERYONE LOOKS FOR A SQUARE DEAL JANE CERTAINLY FOUND ONE 
SWEET OF YOU TO DO MY WASHING JANE 
WHAT'S THIS SQUARE DEAL SURF I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU YOU GET MORE POWDER 
AND THE PRICE STILL THE SAME BETTER VALUE BEST THERE IS 
THERE IS A FORMULA IN ADVERTISING CALLED TWO TARTS IN THE KITCHEN A EUPHEMISM FOR 
THAT FORMULA CAME ABOUT BECAUSE MANUFACTURERS WANTED YOU TO TAKE THEIR PRODUCT SERIOUSLY 
IT'S A CHEAP EASY FORMULA AND IT CONTINUES TO WORK 
THE WOMAN IS AT HER WITS' END BECAUSE HER WASHING ISN'T WHITE 
SHE DIDN'T KNOW TILL NOSEY PARKER TOLD HER 
BUT NOSEY PARKER HAS ALSO GOT SOMETHING WHICH WILL SOLVE HER PROBLEM 
THE CONVICTION OF THE IGNORANT BY THE KNOWLEDGEABLE 
ANYONE AT HOME COME IN 
I'VE GOT A WASHING MACHINE TOO LOVELY DEAR 
LIGHTNING IN YOUR KITCHEN LIGHTNING 
WHAT ARE YOU PUTTING IN YOUR WASHING FLASH IN THE WASH IT GETS THE CLOTHES CLEAN 
THOSE EXTRA SOAPY SUDS ACTUALLY PROTECT YOUR MACHINE 
SUPER AJAX NEW BLEACH BOOSTER 
STARTS BLEACHING BEFORE YOU START TO RUB 
DOES IT REALLY WORK LOOK 
EVEN THE ACTRESSES WERE LOSING THE BATTLE TO KEEP A STRAIGHT FACE 
SUPER AJAX REALLY IS FAST THE SOLUTION WAS TO MAKE THE BEST OF THE INTRINSIC COMEDY 
AND GIVE CHARACTER ACTORS THE LICENCE TO HAM IT UP FURTHER 
IT'LL COST NO IT'S CHEAPER NOT LIKE REAL MEAT THOUGH 
IT IS REAL MEAT AND A NICE CHANGE FRED SAYS OOH 
THE SET UP WAS SOON RIPE FOR PARODY 
PHIL CALLS ME HIS LITTLE DISHWASHER WHAT D'YOU CALL HIM BONE IDLE 
WHAT'S THAT THE HIDDEN POWER WHAT THE HIDDEN POWER OF TOFFEE CRISP 
OOH IT REALLY WORKS SO IT SEEMS DID THE GENRE 
NEIGHBOURS IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES CONTINUED TO FIND FAULT BUT SET MATTERS RIGHT 
DON'T YOU KNOW ABOUT ALL TEMPERATURE DAZ 
ONE POWDER FOR ALL THAT YES DAZ WASHES IN HOT WARM AND COOL WATER 
THREE TEMPERATURES ONE POWDER TRY IT 
THE FORMAT IS REGULAR RITUAL I KNOW HOW IT WILL END 
HOW DID YOU GET ON GRAND LOOK HOW WHITE 
EVERYBODY LAUGHS AT IT 
PEOPLE KNOW IT'S ABSURD 
BUT IT'S GOT THE RITUAL REVEALING OF INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE FIND REASSURING 
AND I DARESAY THEY ALWAYS WILL 
OH IT REALLY WORKS IT CONTINUES TO WORK BECAUSE WOMEN LET IT WORK 
THEY MIGHT PRIVATELY BE CRITICAL OF THE FORMULA 
BUT THOSE ADS ARE RESEARCHED AND WOMEN SAY THAT'S FINE AND SO IT CONTINUES 
YOU'RE BUSY MAKING THE MOST OF THE SUNSHINE SO WHY HANG IT UP IN THE SHADOW 
WHAT'S A SHADOW THAT'S ONE 
I SEE BUT THERE'S STILL A SHADOW ON THAT SHIRT IT'S JUST FROM THE TREE 
UH UH THAT'S DIRT THAT HAPPENS NOT WITH NEW ARIEL 
IN ADVERTISING YOU'VE GOT ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO TELL A STORY AND GET ACROSS INFORMATION 
SO THE USE OF THE STEREOTYPE IS TO TELL PEOPLE THE STORY AS FAST AS POSSIBLE 
YOU CANNOT CREATE AN ORIGINAL CHARACTER IN THE FIRST TWELVE SECONDS 
ADVERTISERS FROM THE BEGINNING FELL BACK ON STEREOTYPES 
ONE WAS THE EMPTY HEADED BIMBO 
MORNING MORNING MRS. PALMER 
MRS. PALMER HAS A HEART OF GOLD AND SHE KEEPS IT IN THE BREAD BIN 
THE GOODNESS IN HOVIS 
SOME BIMBOS DELIGHTED IN THEIR IGNORANCE 
HE STILL TEASES ME ABOUT THE CHOPSTICKS 
I'LL NEVER LEARN IN A WAY I'M RATHER GLAD 
FROM VESTA WITH LOVE 
THE BIMBO AND THE KITCHEN TOWEL HAD THE SAME LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE 
MADE TO MOP UP LIKE A SPONGE BECAUSE THEY'RE DOUBLE THICK 
IN THE MID SIXTIES DAVID OGILVIE FOUNDER OF OGILVIE AND MATHER CONDEMNED THE PATRONISING IMAGES 
WITH WHAT WAS TO BECOME THE MOST FAMOUS REPRIMAND TO ADVERTISING HE WOULD LECTURE HIS COLLEAGUES 
THE CONSUMER'S NOT A MORON SHE'S YOUR WIFE 
IF THE BIMBO WAS NOW SEEN AS A LIABILITY 
AN ALTERNATIVE WAS HER OPPOSITE 
THAT'S SQUARE DEAL SURF FOR YOU VALUE ALL ALONG THE LINE 
I'VE TRIED THEM ALL AND I'M TELLING YOU SURF'S BETTER VALUE 
THIS STRIDENT KITCHEN KNOW ALL WAS A DOWN TO EARTH ALTERNATIVE TO THE EXPERT 
SHE HAD A GROWN UP FAMILY SO WAS OVER FORTY 
AND TO PROVE HER THRIFT 
SHE WAS SCOTTISH FLASH DOES THE JOB IN HALF THE TIME 
NO MESSY SUDS TO RINSE 
FLASH CLEANS FLOORS FAST AND NO MESSING 
SUCH NO NONSENSE CONVICTION 
WAS APPROPRIATE TO BOSSING KIDS 
HAD YOUR BREAKFAST NO TIME 
SIT DOWN WON'T TAKE LONG 
E. FOR B. EH EGGS FOR BREAKFAST 
IF EVERYONE HAD E. FOR B. THERE'D BE MORE HAPPY FACES E. FOR B. AND BE YOUR BEST 
DOES SHE ALWAYS GO ON LIKE THIS 
HARRIS BACON IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE CREATED A NEW HEROINE A REMARKABLE PREMONITION 
GREAT TASTE NO RIND READY FOR THE PACK 
IF YOU WANT GREAT TASTE NOTHING BEATS HARRIS WILTSHIRE 
OH HOW LOVELY IS IT FOR ME 
NOT EVERYONE DEALT IN STEREOTYPES 
SOME USED REAL CHARACTERS 
THE PIONEER OF THE SLICE OF LIFE WAS OXO 
IT WAS LOVELY I'M HUNGRY 
YOU'RE HEARTLESS IT'S ONLY A FILM 
AND I'M STARVING YOU MEN ARE ALL ALIKE 
ALL YOU THINK ABOUT IS FOOD 
OUT OF THE WAY I'LL GET IT 
IT'S ALL READY WHAT IS IT 
BEEF AND THINGS THINGS YES 
COOKED WITH OXO 
WHAT KATIE WAS DOING AND HUSBAND PHILIP 
THERE WERE ACTUALLY A COUPLE OF PHILIPS 
WAS TO TRANSFER HER COMPARATIVE YOUTH AND SOUTH EAST ACCENT 
TO ASSOCIATE THAT WITH THE CUBE 
THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE HOPED PEOPLE WOULD SAY I WANT TO BE LIKE KATIE 
IT JUST SAYS IF OXO IS USED BY PEOPLE LIKE THAT IT MUST BE O. K. 
WE WERE RELEASING INHIBITIONS 
KATIE WAS THE ARCHETYPE FOR THE ADVERTISING GOODWIFE 
AS THAT IDEAL CHANGED SO KATIE CHANGED WITH IT 
BUT TO BEGIN WITH SHE SEEMED TO CRUMBLE CUBES FOR ONE REASON MAN APPEAL 
MAN APPEAL MAN APPEAL 
MAN APPEAL 
PHILIP M. M. M. WHAT MADE YOU PROPOSE TO ME 
BECAUSE I FOUND YOU 
IRRESISTIBLE 
YOU COULD COOK 
KATIE AND PHILIP WERE NO MR. AND MRS. AVERAGE THEY LIVED THE HIGH LIFE 
DELICACIES WITH FOREIGN NAMES WERE SERVED AT ELEGANT SOIREES IN THEIR DESIGNER HOME 
PHILIP EVEN HAD TIME FOR A GAME OF SQUASH YEARS BEFORE THE SPORT BECAME WIDESPREAD 
THEY WENT TO THE BALLET BUT PHILIP WAS MAN ENOUGH NOT TO ENJOY IT 
CAN'T WE EAT OUT I'VE MADE SOMETHING GOULASH 
I COULD DO WITH SOME GOULASH DO YOU MIND WITH NOODLES 
BUT THIS WAS TOO AVANT GARDE FOR THE MARKET 
KATIE AND PHILIP NEEDED TO BE TAKEN DOWN A PEG OR TWO 
KATIE WAS SEEN TO BE A LITTLE TOO PRISSY SUBURBAN FOR OXO FOOD 
SOMEBODY DESCRIBED HER AS MAKING TOO MUCH PIPED POTATO 
SHE WAS IN DOILY LAND 
SO THEY MOVED TO THE COUNTRY 
THAT WAS SOLID AND REAL SO THAT'S WHY THAT MOVE HAPPENED 
BUT ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRYSIDE WAS NOT LIBERATION FROM THE KITCHEN 
I COULD STAY HERE FOREVER 
MUM I'M HUNGRY GOOD HEAVENS LUNCHTIME 
PHILIP'S APPETITE HADN'T CHANGED BUT HE'D UNDERGONE A CAREER MOVE 
BUT HE STILL HAD THE HABIT OF GIVING OUT LATE INVITATIONS TO LUNCH 
EHM TWELVE ACTUALLY 
KATIE 
KATIE 
YOU'RE A MARVEL I'M NOT 
I'M A WEAK WOMAN WHO GETS LET IN FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS 
AND THEN RATHER ENJOYS THEM 
THIS WAS THE CLOSEST KATIE EVER CAME TO REBELLION 
EARLIER WOMEN WERE SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF THEIR OWN SUBJECTION 
I CAN'T TELL STORK FROM BUTTER I CAN 
STORK'S MUCH EASIER TO CREAM 
WHEN THEY PONDERED THEIR DRUDGERY 
THEY RATIONALISED IT 
MEN THINK FOOD COOKS ITSELF STILL IT'S A COMPLIMENT TO BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED 
IN THE CHANGING WORLD ON THE BRINK OF THE SEVENTIES THE WIFE'S LOAD WAS JUST AS HEAVY 
BUT WITH THE SOCIAL CHANGE THE DILEMMA FOR ADVERTISERS WAS HOW MUCH THEY SHOULD CHANGE 
THESE ARE THE THINGS A WOMAN BUILDS 
GRACE IN HER GIRL CHILDREN 
BOISTEROUSNESS IN HER BOYS 
STRENGTH IN HER MAN 
AND SHE BUILDS WITH THE HELP OF WEETABIX 
GOOD WHOLEWHEAT NOURISHMENT 
THE MESSAGE WAS CLEAR 
THE FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIETY STILL DEPENDED ON MUM 
ANNE GIVES HER FAMILY STORK AND SHE'S BEEN VOTED A STORK SUPERMUM 
HOORAY HOLD ON NOW 
OF ALL BRANDS STORK TRIED HARDEST TO CELEBRATE THE SEVENTIES GOODWIFE 
THE HEROINE NOW CATERED FOR THE ENTIRE NEIGHBOURHOOD 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D HAVE DONE WITHOUT ANNE 
SHE'S A KIND MOTHER AND A GOOD COOK CARRY ON WITH YOUR CAKE 
NO MATTER HOW MANY ARE HERE SHE'S ALWAYS GOT TIME FOR YOU I LOVE HER I THINK SHE'S GREAT 
GOOD 
BUT NOT ALL PRODUCTS COULD EXPLOIT THE FAMILY THROUGH SUCH TABLOID EMOTIONS 
AN ALTERNATIVE WAS TO PORTRAY HOUSEWORK AS A JOY 
WHITENS WHITER THAN ANY OTHER 
THIS IDEA ACHIEVED NOTORIETY AND THEN CULT STATUS IN ANOTHER CAMPAIGN 
SHAKE N'VAC IT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO 
DO THE SHAKE N'VAC AND PUT THE FRESHNESS BACK 
WHEN YOUR CARPET SMELLS FRESH THE ROOM DOES TOO 
EVERY TIME YOU VACUUM REMEMBER WHAT TO DO OOH 
SHAKE N'VAC IN THREE FRAGRANCES 
IT'S REMARKABLE THE WAY IT'S SURVIVED SO LONG 
THAT ADVERTISEMENT WAS INTRODUCED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AND RAN FOR TEN YEARS IT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO 
AND IT WAS SOMETHING NEW 
PEOPLE DIDN'T THROW POWDER ONTO THE FLOOR AND VACUUM IT UP IT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO 
WHEN SOMEONE CAME IN THEY COULD SEE THAT THE HOUSEWORK HAD BEEN DONE 
SO THAT WAS A REWARD 
BUT FOR MOST WOMEN LACK OF REWARD IS THE REALITY OF HOUSEWORK 
THINGS WIND YOU UP MOST ADVERTISERS IGNORED THIS 
BUT SOME REALISED THAT WOMEN NEEDED TIME FOR THEMSELVES 
BUT STERN WORDS WERE REQUIRED TO GET THEM TO TAKE IT 
A LOT OF WOMEN DON'T HAVE LUNCH THE EXCUSE IS IT'S NOT WORTH IT JUST FOR ME WELL IT IS 
SO BE A GOOD GIRL HAVE LUNCH TOMORROW ENCOURAGING HER TO TAKE A BREAK 
WAS GIVEN MILEAGE BY BRITISH RAIL 
WE TRAVEL INTER CITY LIKE THE MEN DO 
SO JOIN US ON THE INTER CITY WHEN YOU FEEL YOU NEED A LITTLE HOLIDAY 
AWAY FROM THE KITCHEN SINK AND NEED YOU ASK 
WE'RE LEAVING BEHIND THE COMMON TASKS 
TRAVEL INTER CITY LIKE THE MEN DO 
WE LOVE A LITTLE OUTING NOW AND THEN 
SO UP WITH WOMEN'S RIGHTS COME UP AND SEE THE SIGHTS 
AWAY FROM IT ALL AND HOME AGAIN 
TIME FOR YOURSELF WORKED ITS WAY INTO THE MOST UNLIKELY ADS 
DESPITE DAD'S INCOMPETENCE MUM COULD TRUST HIM TO KEEP THE FAMILY SAFE UNTIL HER RETURN 
I'VE PASSED DOMESTOS KILLS ALL KNOWN GERMS 
THERE WAS MUCH MORE TO COME 
IT BECAME MORE COMMON TO PEP UP THE LIFESTYLE OF THE USERS 
MY LIFE'S ACTIVE BUT I NEED MORE TO KEEP ME IN SHAPE AEROBICS 
AND WITH MY LAUNDRY JUST CLEAN ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH I EXPECT MORE SO I CHOOSE BOLD 
ADDING SOME AEROBICS SUPPOSEDLY MADE HER AND THE POWDER 
LET SURF GET ON WITH YOUR WASH WHILE YOU GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE 
SOME ADVERTS PRAISED TURNING TIME FOR YOURSELF INTO A WAY OF LIFE 
THREE YEARS AGO I ONLY WATCHED SUZY'S SCHOOL PLAY 
TODAY I'M IT LOTS OF THINGS HAVE CHANGED 
WHAT HAS CHANGED IS THAT ADS NO LONGER SHOW WOMEN AS THOUGH HOUSEWORK IS EVERYTHING 
AND THE MAIN WAY IN WHICH THEY GET REWARDS AS PEOPLE 
I USED TO RUN THE KIDS TO SCHOOL TODAY I'M HELPING RUN THE ATHLETICS TEAM 
WHAT HASN'T CHANGED IS THAT MOST WASHING POWDER ADS STILL SHOW WOMEN RATHER THAN MEN 
THAT'S BECAUSE MOST WOMEN DO THE WASHING 
OCCASIONALLY MEN WERE SHOWN HELPING OUT BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS A REASON FOR IT 
GIVING HER A BROKEN LIMB GAVE HIM PERMISSION TO COOK 
BUT ADVERTISING WAS TREADING ON DANGEROUS TERRITORY 
SHOWING THE MAN WITH THE APRON ON TURNED OFF A LOT OF WOMEN 
WE DID AN AD WHERE A MAN WAS WASHING THE FLOOR BECAUSE HIS WIFE HAD HAD A BABY 
SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T SEE THE CRIB AND THOUGHT SHE WAS LAZY 
AND WHAT A WIMP THE HUSBAND WAS AND DIDN'T IDENTIFY WITH IT 
ADVERTISERS IN THE EIGHTIES CONTINUED TO EXPERIMENT WITH ROLE REVERSAL 
THE DEVICE WAS STILL CONTROVERSIAL 
IF MEN AND WOMEN SWAPPED THEIR TRADITIONAL JOBS WOT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT 
COOKING SAME AS LAST NIGHT 
MEN WOULD SOON STOP DREAMING OF A NEW CAR AND START DREAMING OF A NEW COOKER 
THE NEW CREDA CONCEPT SO THEY'LL HAVE A DELICIOUS MEAL WAITING FOR THE BREADWINNER 
I'LL BE LATE PLAYING DARTS WITH THE GIRLS 
IN THE CASE OF ROLE REVERSAL THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW CASES 
WHERE ADVERTISING HAS TAKEN IT UPON ITSELF TO LEAD SOCIETY 
THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT IF WOMEN WENT TO WORK THEY WOULDN'T CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING ELSE 
IN FACT OF COURSE THEY DO 
SO I FEEL THAT WHEN ADVERTISING PUT IT ON THE SMALL SCREEN 
WOMEN FELT THAT WASN'T REALITY AND DIDN'T IDENTIFY WITH IT 
IF ROLE REVERSAL DIDN'T WORK A NEW REALISM DID 
THE PRICE SHE STAYED IN THE KITCHEN 
THE NEW PERSIL MUM TOOK AS MUCH PRIDE IN THE FAMILY'S WASH BUT WOULDN'T BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED 
RIGHT I'M OFF BYE PET 
WHERE'S MY STUFF WHAT STUFF I LEFT A FEW THINGS OH 
WASN'T IT TO BE THROWN OUT 
EH 
THAT WAS ALL ME STUFF ME KIT MU UM 
LUCKY I WASHED IT THEN 
ADVERTISING HAD MADE WHAT FOR IT WAS A STARTLING DISCOVERY 
FAMILY LIFE WAS GRIM UNTIL THEN IT HAD ALMOST BEEN TABOO TO RESEMBLE REAL FAMILIES 
ASK YOUR DAD IF HE'S JOINING US 
MUM SAYS ARE YOU JOINING US 
I THINK THAT MEANS YES 
OXO'S NEW FAMILY BORN OF CAREFUL RESEARCH WAS DIFFERENT POTATOES DARLING 
THANK 
THE RESEARCHERS SAID IF I WAS TO SAY FAMILY LIFE TO YOU WHAT COMES TO MIND 
GRIND DRUDGERY ARGUING 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW WASHING UP ISOLATION TIRED 
SQUABBLING MAKING FOOD 
LEAVE 
IN GENERAL WOMEN THOUGHT THAT FAMILY LIFE AVERAGED OUT AT HAPPY 
BUT LOTS OF UPS AND DOWNS 
YOU DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE GOOD UNTIL YOU COMPARED IT WITH THE BAD 
ONE WOMAN SAID WAR AND PEACE 
MY CHRISTMAS BY ALISON 
MUMMY LOVED ME IN MY NEW DRESS NICK GOT A SUPER PULLOVER WITH A PUPPY ON IT 
AND GRANDPA PLAYED JINGLE BELLS AGAIN JUST LIKE LAST YEAR 
JASON GOT A PRESENT THAT MADE US LAUGH 
AND DADDY DID A TERRIFIC MAGIC SHOW 
EVERYBODY HAD THE MOST WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS 
AND MUMMY MUM MADE THE GRAVY 
THE CURRENT OXO MUM IS SUPERWOMAN SOCIETY DEMANDED HER ADVERTISING DELIVERED 
WORKING LATE START WITHOUT ME 
TUESDAY 
SHE WORKS HARDER THAN ANYBODY ELSE KNOWS IT BUT ACCEPTS IT 
SUCH IS HER RESILIENCE SHE CEASES EVEN TO COMPLAIN 
I'M STARVING HOW WAS THE CASSEROLE 
OH THAT GOOD 
DEMANDS ON WOMEN ARE GETTING MORE INTENSE 
AND THERE IS LESS TIME TO MEET THEM 
THERE ISN'T THE TIME TO DO IT 
MUM WE'RE HUNGRY 
I FEEL THERE IS GOING TO COME A POINT IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE 
WHERE WOMEN WILL HAVE TO START TO CHANGE THE SITUATION 
MUM HE'LL BE HERE IN A MINUTE MUM PLEASE 
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH A BAD TIME BEFORE THEN WHEN ONE ROLE WILL GIVE WAY 
WOMEN WILL RETREAT INTO THE HOME OR WILL MINIMISE THE DEMANDS OF CERTAIN ROLES 
OR COUPLES WILL BECOME JUST SHARED MORTGAGES 
ANY DANGER OF BEING FED OH 
PRAWNS NO WHITEBAIT NO TROUT 
WHAT YOU TREAT THE PLACE LIKE ONE 
SO I THOUGHT IT MIGHT AS WELL LOOK LIKE ONE 
BUT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE SNAPPING POINT FOR MOST WOMEN 
WOULD BE AGAINST THE CAREER 
WHAT DOES YOUR DAD DO LANDSCAPE GARDENER 
ON SATURDAYS HE DOES ARCHERY 
ARCHERY 
MY SISTER PLAYS TENNIS ON SATURDAYS SHE WORKS IN A SHOP 
SO WHAT DOES YOUR MUM DO 
I DON'T THINK MUM DOES ANYTHING 
HELP YOURSELF 
YOU DON'T GET THANKS FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO COME BACK 
BUT YOU KNOW WHY YOU BUY FLORA 
IN THE STATES THEY SAY THAT WE ARE RETURNING TO AN ERA OF NEO TRADITIONALISM 
WHAT THIS MEANS FOR WOMEN'S ROLES IS THAT WOMEN ARE GOING TO BE ALLOWED BACK IN THE HOME 
IT WILL BE IMPLIED THAT ONE COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING MORE EXCITING BUT CHOSE TO STAY AT HOME 
AND AS IN THE FIFTIES WHEN WOMEN WERE WILLING ACCOMPLICES 
I THINK IN THE NINETIES THEY WILL AGAIN BECAUSE THE EIGHTIES PROVED TOO MUCH 
AND MUMMY 
MUMMY MADE THE GRAVY 
DO THE SHAKE N'VAC AND PUT THE FRESHNESS BACK 
DO THE SHAKE N'VAC AND PUT THE FRESHNESS BACK 
WHEN YOUR CARPET SMELLS FRESH YOUR ROOM DOES TOO 
EVERY TIME YOU VACUUM REMEMBER WHAT TO DO 
DO THE SHAKE N'VAC AND PUT THE FRESHNESS BACK 
WORKS ON RUGS TOO
