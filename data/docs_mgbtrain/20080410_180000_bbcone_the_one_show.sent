HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW 
TONIGHT I HAVE BIG DAN SNOW 
KEEPING ME COMPANY 
IT'S GREAT TO 
BE HERE BUT NOT ONLY DO I SIT 
BESIDE CHRISTINE I GET OF RAISING THE 
TEMPERATURE OR SO HIS WIFE TELLS 
US IT'S GYLSE BRANDRETH 
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN OBSESSED BY THE 
WEATHER BUT NOW THERE IS ANOTHER 
NATIONAL ADDICTION 
CAPS MOBILE PHONE RING TONES 
THE TERM IS HOME INEO PHOBIA AND 
IT APPARENTLY MEANS A FEAR OF 
BEING WITHOUT A MOBILE PHONE AND 
APPARENTLY YOU CAN TELL A LOT ABOUT 
A MAN FROM HIS RING TONE SO WHILST 
DAN WAS GETTING HIS LUNCH I 
RUMMAGED THROUGH HIS THINGS AND 
HEARD DAN'S RING TONE 
A 
IT IS QUITE TRADITIONAL WHAT DO 
YOU HAVE 
I PREFER MINE ON VIBE RATE 
NOW THIS WEEK THEY WERE ALLOWED 
ON THE LAST MOBILE PHONE FREE 
FRONTIER PLANES 
OUR REPORTER IS SCREAMING FOR THE 
EJECTOR SEAT WE ALL LIKE A NICE 
BIT OF PEACE AND QUIET DOWN WE 
ISN'T IT ANNOYING WHEN PEOPLE TALK 
REALLY LOUDLY NEXT TO YOU 
YOU WON'T STOP TALKING 
THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE WITH PEOPLE 
RABBITING ON MOBILE PHONES ALL THE 
TIME WHY CAN'T IT BE LIKE THE GOOD 
OLD DAYS THE FIRST MOBILE PHONE 
CALL WAS MADE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE ONCE JUST 
FOR YUPPIES THERE IS NOW SEVENTY 
MILLION IN THE U. K. 
ARE YOU TALKING ON 
YOUR MOBILE PHONE YES 
ARE YOU AN YES ADDICT COULD YOU LIVE WITHOUT IT 
NO I WOULD BE LOST 
IT'S LIKE 
LIVING WITH A WOMAN CAN'T LIVE 
WITH THEM BUT CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT 
THEM 
DOES IT ANNOY YOU WHEN PEOPLE THEM TALK IN PUBLIC ON THEIR MOBILE 
PHONE YES 
HOW MUCH 
THIS MUCH PHONE YES WHY DON'T WE HAVE PLANES AND TRAINS 
THAT ARE TOTALLY SILENT 
THE MOBILE 
PHONE IS THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND 
SHOULD BE BANNED BY LAW 
IN TWO THOUSAND THREE IN SOME COUNTRIES THEY ARE 
BANNED IN PUBLIC BARS UNLIKE THE 
U. K. UNBELIEVABLY THE POST OFFICE 
HAS WRITTEN SOME ADVICE ABOUT HOME 
INEO PHOBIA KEEP YOUR BATTERIES 
CHARGED UP AND KEEP YOUR NUMBERS 
PRIVATE WHY CAN'T WE COPE WITHOUT 
OUR MOBILES 
I THINK THE MORE WE 
USE THEM TO ORGANISE OUR LIVES THE 
MORE DIFFICULT IT IS TO LIVE 
WITHOUT THEM 
WHY IS IT SO ANNOYING 
ON THE TRAIN 
I THINK PSYCHOLOGICAL 
HEARING HALF A CONVERSATION IS FAR 
MORE ANNOYING THAN HEARING IT ALL 
AND BECAUSE IT IS IN YOUR EAR IT IS 
ANNOYING ANNOYING WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT BRITAIN'S 
PHONE OBSESSION IF ONLY THERE WAS 
SOMEONE I COULD CALL 
GYLSE I HAVE TO ADMIT I AM 
INSEPARABLE FROM MY PHONE 
IT IS 
PATHETIC A GROWN MAN AS TALL AS 
YOU WHO NEEDS THIS EXTRA THING 
NEVER A MAN TO MINCE HIS WORDS AND AND YOU ARE THE SORT OF PERSON WHEN I 
GO TO THE THEATRE AND THESE DAYS IT 
COSTS A FORTUNE AND THEN SUDDENLY 
THE PHONE GOES AND THERE IS A 
FUMBLING TO GET IT AND IT'S NOT 
THAT PERSON IT'S THE PERSON BEHIND 
ONE MOBILE PHONE CAN CAUSE HAVOC TO 
THOUSANDS AND ON THE BUSES AND THE 
TRAINS PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN TALK 
IN AN INTIMATE WAY THE THINGS I'VE 
HEARD ABOUT SIAN SIMPLY BY 
LISTENING TO OTHER PEOPLE SIAN SIAN YOU WORK WITH ACTION ON ADDICTION 
I DO 
AND THIS CAN CAUSE A PROBLEM 
FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE 
IF YOU HAVE AN 
ADDICTIVE NATURE IT IS IN THE 
NATURE OF THE PIECE YOU COULD BE 
ADDICTED TO DRINKING SHOPPING AND 
MOBILE PHONES FOLLOW ON FROM THAT 
AND MY HUSBAND WITHOUT BUSINESS 
BLACKBERRY HE CAN'T LIVE AND AND MADONNA SLEEPS WITH HERS AND AND THEY'RE MAKING PILLOW CASES FOR 
BLACKBERRIES HAVE YOU HEARD OF 
THAT 
WE'RE SELF CONFESSED ADDICTS THAT BUT THIS AFTER NON WE WERE MADE TO 
GO COLD TURKEY 
YOU CERTAINLY WERE 
THIS AFTERNOON I WRESTLED 
CHRISTINE AND DAN'S MOBILES FROM 
THEM AND I'VE LOCKED THEM AWAY AND 
I'M GOING TO SEE HOW MANY MISED 
CALLS AND TEXTS THEY'VE HAD MINE MINE IS RINGING IT'S TERRIBLE 
COMPOSE MYSELF LAST WEEK GYLSE 
KICKED OFF HIS NEW SERIES OF FILMS 
LOOKING AT PLACES AROUND THE 
COUNTRY THAT INSPIRED FAMOUS NOVELS 
HE STARTED WITH COUNT DRACULA AND 
TODAY HE VISITS BRUMMIE HOBBITS 
GREAT BOOKS LIKE LORD OF THE RINGS 
CREATE THEIR OWN SPECIAL WORLD BUT 
AT THE HEART OF THIS FANTASY LIES 
THE SHIRE AN IDEAL RURAL BEAUTY 
IT IS SOMETHING OF A SURPRISE TO 
FIND THAT TOLL KEEN'S INSPIRATION 
FOR THIS TOLKIEN'S GREEN AND 
PLEASANT LAND IS HERE BIRMINGHAM 
IT SEEMS AN UNLIKELY PLACE TO COME 
LOOKING FOR MIDDLE EARTH WITH 
HOBBITS AND MAGICAL RINGS YET 
TOLLINGIN'S TOLKIEN'S MIDDLE 
EARTH IS HERE THIS IS WHERE HE 
SPENT THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES TODAY IT IS PART 
OF THE CITY BUT BACK THEN IT WAS 
THE VILLAGE OF SERHALT DOMINATED 
BY ITS MILL THIS PRECIOUS 
GREENSPACE GAVE TOLKIEN KEEN THE 
INSPIRATION FOR THE SHIRE BETWEEN 
THE AGES OF FOUR AND EIGHT LITTLE 
RONALD TOLKIEN AND HIS BROTHER 
LIVED SOMEWHERE NEAR HERE JUST JUST OVER THE ROAD THERE AND HE SAW 
THIS EVERY TIME HE CAME OUT OF HIS 
HOUSE 
SO HE SAW WHAT WAS GOING ON HOUSE HE WAS FASCINATED BY IT AND EVEN 
IN LORD OF THE RINGS HOBBITS ARE 
FASCINATED BY MILLS THEY LOVE THEM 
SAM NOTICED THAT THE OLD MILL HAD 
VANISHED AND A RED BRICK BUILDING 
WAS BEING OUT UP WHERE IT STOOD 
THERE WAS A TALL RED CHIMNEY 
NEARBY THERE IS SOME DEVILRY IN 
THE SHIRE HE SAID 
HOW DO WE KNOW IT IS THIS MILL IN IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX HE TALKED ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT 
THIS AREA WAS IN HIS FICTIONAL WORK 
AND HE BASED THE CHARACTERS ON THE 
PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THEAMLET AROUND 
HERE 
BIRMINGHAM WAS THICK WITH HERE MEMORIES FOR TOLKIEN AND IT IS NOT 
ONLY THE MILL THAT FINDS ITS WAY 
INTO THE BOOK TOLKIEN CALLED THE 
SECOND OF HIS BOOKS THE TWO TOWERS 
AND I THINK I'VE FOUND THEM IN THE 
BOOK THESE TOWERS DOMINATE THE SKY 
GLAREING OUT AT ONE ANOTHER AND 
THEY ARE RIGHT HERE 
UP IT ROSE EVEN TO THE LEVEL OF 
THE TOP MOST CIRCLE AND THERE IT 
WAS CROWNED BY A BATTLEMENT SO 
THAT THOSE IN THE CITADEL COULD 
LOOK FROM THE PEAK SEVEN HUNDRED FEET BELOW 
THE FIRST OF THE TOWERS IS PERRET'S 
FOLLY AN OLD HUNTING LODGE IT 
SITS ON THE EDGE OF BIRMINGHAM AND 
FACES AN EQUALLY DAUNTING NEIGHBOUR 
EDGBASTON WATER TOWER VICTORIAN 
ENGINEERING AT ITS BEST AND WHEN IT 
JOINED THE SKYLINE TOLKIEN HAD ITS 
TWO TOWERS LOOK A HOBBIT SIZED 
DOOR I WONDER IF TOLKIEN KNEW IT 
JUST A FEW MILES FROM THE TOWERS 
STANDS MOSLEY BOG A PLAYGROUND FOR 
THE YOUNG TOLKIEN IT BECOMES THE 
FOREST IN THE BOOK 
IT IS CHAPTER 
FOUR I THINK IN LORD OF THE RINGS 
AND THE FELLOWSHIP HAVE JUST BEGUN 
THEIR LONG JOURNEY TOWARDS MAUDOR 
AND THEY ESCAPE INTO THIS WOOD AND 
THE TREES COME TO LIFE AND ENCLOSE 
THEM 
EVERYTHING IN IT IS MORE THEM AWARE MORE ALIVE OF WHAT IS GOING 
ON THAN IN THE SHIRE AND THE TREES 
DO NOT LIKE STRANGERS THEY WATCH 
YOU 
THE TREES ARE ALL VERY YOU MYSTERIOUS ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT 
FALL WHEN THEY COME TO LIFE AND 
THERE ARE TREES IN THE LORD OF THE 
RINGS THAT COME TO LIFE 
THEY WERE 
LOOKING AT A MOST EXTRAORDINARY 
FACE IT BELONGED TO A LARGE MAN 
LIKE FIGURE AT LEAST FOURTEEN FOOT HIGH 
CLAD IN STUFF LIKE GREEN AND GREY 
BARK I AM AN ENT THAT'S WHAT THEY 
CALL ME 
AND THESE VERY TREES 
COULD HAVE BEEN HERE ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
WHEN TOLKIEN WAS FIVE OR SIX AND 
PLAYING IN THIS PARTICULAR WOOD 
THAT'S RIGHT LORD OF THE RINGS IS 
FULL OF NOSTALGIA NOSTALGIA FOR 
LOST CHILDHOOD AND LOST WORLD AND 
THEY ALL GET TIED UP IN THIS 
PRECIOUS SPACE THIS PRECIOUS BIT 
OF CHILDHOOD WHEN TOLKIEN WAS HAPPY 
A LOST WORLD AND WE'VE BEEN LUCKY 
ENOUGH TO FIND IT WONDERFUL L. WAS 
PAYING ATTENTION TO GYLSE THERE 
BUT ALSO MY PHONE THAT HAS BEEN 
RINGING ALL THE WAY THROUGH MUM 
I'LL PHONE YOU AFTERWARDS THERE'S 
NO POINT IN PHONING NOW LOADS OF 
PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN IN WITH THEIR 
FAMOUS PLACES 
SOMEBODY SUGGESTING 
THE BORROWERS BY MARY NORTON BEING 
CONNECTED TO LEIGHTON BUZZARD AND 
THIS PERSON WROTE TO US SAYING I 
GO TO THE SCHOOL WHERE MARY NORTON 
WENT AND THE DRAIN WHERE THE 
BORROWERS CAME OUT IS STILL THERE 
AND THE WAR OF THE WORLDS COMES 
FROM WOKING H. G. WELLS CAME FROM 
WOKING AND THE COMMON IS THE 
SETTING FOR THE LANDING OF THE 
SPACESHIP 
THAT'S GLAMOROUS THOMAS SPACESHIP THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE THE ISLE OF WALNEY 
IS THE SUGGESTION HERE IT COMES 
FROM KEITH SEWELL THE ISLE OF 
WALNEY WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR THE 
THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE SERIES THE 
ISLAND THAT THOMAS LIVES ON IS IN 
THE SAME PLACE ON THE MAPS AS 
WALNEY AND OUR AREA OF VICARS TOWN 
IS ALSO CALLED EVICT YAR'S TOWN IN 
THE BOOKS AND THE REVEREND WHO 
WROTE THE BOOKS WENT THERE ON 
HOLIDAY AND THIS LADY LIVES ON 
THE ROAD THAT INSPIRED THE RILE WAY 
CHILDREN IN LEWISHAM 
E. E. NESBIT LIVED THERE WITH HER 
HUSBAND HIS MISSTRESS AND THREE 
CHILDREN AND MAID FOR ABOUT THREE 
YEARS AND THIS LADY CAME TO LIVE 
THERE IN EIGHT AND AT THAT TIME THE 
HOUSE WAS EMPTY AND A HOME FOR 
STRAY CATS AND NOW IT HAS PLAQUE 
ON IT SAYING E. E. NESBIT LIVED 
HERE 
IF YOU KNOW THE LOCATION FOR HERE A NATIONAL CLASSIC PLEASE TELL US 
TOMORROW KEVIN SPACEY'S LATEST 
BLOCKBUSTER TWENTY ONE HITS THE CINEMAS 
IT WAS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY OF 
A GROUP OF MATH STUDENTS WHO FOUND 
A WAY TO BEAT THE CASINOS IN 
AMERICA AMERICA I'M TALKING ABOUT GETTING VERY 
VERY RICH WEIRD WEIRD WELCOME TO VEGAS 
IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES A GROUP OF 
STUDENTS USING SOME RATHER CLEVER 
MATHS REALLY DID WIN SIX MILLION DOLLARS 
PLAYING BLACKJACK THE WORLD'S MOST 
POPULAR GAME ALSO CALLED TWENTY ONE 
WANT TO KNOW IF I CAN DO IT TOO 
IT'S SIMPLE YOU PLAY AGAINST THE 
DEALER YOU'RE GIVEN TWO CARDS THE 
FACE CARDS ARE WORTH TEN POINTS 
THE CLOSEST TO TWENTY ONE WINS IF YOU GO 
OVER YOU LOSE IF THE DEALER GOES 
OVER THEY LOSE 
THE UNUSUAL THING 
ABOUT TWENTY ONE IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE 
HIT ME BUST THE CARDS INSTEAD OF 
GOING TO THE BACK OF THE PACK GET 
DISCARDED AND THAT MEANS THE ODDS 
ARE ALWAYS CHANGING IF YOU CAN 
REMEMBER WHICH CARDS HAVE BEEN 
DISCARDED YOU CAN USE MATHS TO 
CALCULATE WHETHER THE ODDS ARE 
CHANGING IN YOUR FAVOUR OR THE 
DEALER'S BUT REMEMBERING SO MANY 
CARDS IS NOT EASY FORTUNATELY I 
HAVE WITH ME DOMINIC O'BRIEN 
MEMORY MAN AND FORMER CARD COUNTER 
O. K. LET'S TEST YOUR MEMORY 
TWO OF 
CLUB TEN OF HEARTS TWO OF 
DIAMONDS NINE OF CLUBS TWO OF 
SPADES 
DOMINIC EIGHT TIMES WORLD SPADES MEMORY CHAMPION IS UNSURPRISINGLY 
RATHER GOOD AT REMEMBERING CARDS 
WOW WOW NOW CLEARLY LEARNING A PACK OF 
CARDS OFF BY HEART IS GOING TO BE 
SOMETHING OF A CHALLENGE BUT THERE 
IS A SIMPLER VERSION INVENTED BY A 
MATHEMATICIAN CALLED EDWARD THORPE 
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THORPE RAN HUNDREDS 
OF CALCULATIONS ASSESSING THE 
EFFECT DIFFERENT CARDS HAVE ON THE 
PROBABLEIBILITY OF WINNING HE 
DISCOVERED THAT THE PACK COULD BE 
SPLIT INTO THREE GROUPS GOOD BAD 
OR NEUTRAL 
HIS GENIUS WAS TO ADESCRIBE A 
SIMPLE VALUE TO EACH OF THESE 
GROUPS GROUPS ACIBED 
ASCRIBED IT WAS ESSENTIALLY SIMPLE 
MATHS 
YES HE DIDN'T HAVE TO MATHS REMEMBER THE SEQUENCE OF THE CARDS 
IT WAS A SIMPLE SYSTEM SEVEN 
EIGHT AND NINE THERE'S NEUTRAL 
THE LOW CARDS HAVE A VALUE OF PLUS 
ONE BUT THE HIGH CARDS MAKE 
BLACKJACK AND WE GIVE THEM A VALUE 
OF MINUS ONE 
SO ALL I NEED TO DO 
IS ADD OR SUBTRACT ONE 
THAT'S IT 
ESSENTIALLY 
I THINK I CAN HAVE A ESSENTIALLY GO THORPE'S SYSTEM FOR CALCULATING 
ODDS IS INCREDIBLY SIMPLE BUT YOU 
NEED TO BE REALLY ON THE BALL 
DOMINIC HAS TO KEEP IN HIS HEAD A 
RUNNING TOTAL OF EVERY CARD THAT IS 
PUT DOWN WITH TWO LOW CARDS AND A 
NEUTRAL THE COUNT IS NOW PLUS TWO 
ANOTHER NEUTRAL THEN A LOW CARD 
AND THE COUNT IS PLUS THREE 
THE CHANCE OF GOOD CARDS NEXT ROUND 
IS GOING UP 
PLUS FOUR PLUS FIVE 
THE COUNT OF FIVE SUGGESTS THE ODDS 
ARE STRONGLY ON MY SIDE NOW IS A 
GOOD TIME FOR A BIG BET 
YOU WANT 
TO PUT YOUR HOUSE ON IT 
O. K. IT'S 
ONLY THE ONE SHOW'S MONEY SO I'LL 
PUT IT ON A GOOD CHACK WE HAVE 
USED THE COUNTING SYSTEM TO TELL US 
WHEN TO RAISE THE STAKES BUT WILL 
I WIN BLACKJACK 
WELL DONE IT BLACKJACK IT WORKED I'M REALLY REALLY 
SURPRISED 
IF 
YOU KEEP BETTING AND SURPRISED YOU BET QUITE A LOT AT THE RIGHT 
TIME YOU ARE GOING TO WIN IN THE 
LONG RUN 
I'M TRULY AMAZE THAT HAD 
SUCH A SIMPLE SYSTEM WORKS AM I 
READY FOR THE CASINOS 
THEY ARE 
VERY MUCH AWARE OF CARD COUNTERS L. 
WOULD STICK WITH YOUR FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS 
I WILL STICK TO FLEECING FRIENDS THEM LET'S HAVE FORTH GO I'M 
FEELING LUCKY UTTERLY BRILLIANT 
I'M STRAIGHT DOWN THERE AFTER THIS 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW CAN CASINOS 
TELL IF YOU ARE COUNTING CARDS 
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THE PATTERN 
THEY'VE RED THE BOOKS AND BEEN TO 
THE FILMS THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE 
WATCHING FOR SOMEONE WHO DOES SMALL 
BETS AND THEN A COUPLE OF BIG BETS 
AND THEN COUPLE OF GUYS WILL COME AND HUSTLE YOU OUT YOU ARE ONLY 
GOING TO WIN FORTY PER CENT OF THE TIME BUT 
IF YOU GET BIG WINS IT MAKES UP FOR 
ALL THE LOS 
HOW CAN IT BE ILLEGAL 
BECAUSE IT IS GOING ON IN YOUR 
HEAD 
IF YOU HAVE A CALCULATOR IN HEAD YOUR SHOE IT'S ILLEGAL BUT THEY 
BASICALLY GRAB YOU AND YOU ARE NOT 
INVITED TO COME BACK AND THEY HAVE 
ALL SORTS OF WAYS OF RECOGNISING 
PEOPLE WHO ARE CARD COUNTING YOU 
GET BANNED 
SHOW ME A TRICK L. DO 
HAVE A MATHS TRICK FOR YOU I'M 
GOING TO TAKE A CARD AND I'M GOING 
TO PUT IT DOWN HERE NOW YOU HAVE 
TO WORK WITH ME WHAT I WANT YOU TO 
DO IS CHOSE ANY THREE FIGURE 
NUMBER 
O. K. SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY ONE 
REVERSE IT NUMBER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN I NUMBER O. K. SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY ONE REVERSE IT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN I WANT YOU TO SUBSTRATEGIC RAIL 
AUTHORITY THAT NUMBER FROM THAT 
NUMBER 
AUTHORITY THAT NUMBER FROM THAT NUMBER SUBTRACT FIVE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR 
WHAT I FIVE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR WANT YOU TO DO NOW IS I WANT YOU TO 
ADD ALL THESE DIGITS UP EIGHTEEN GREAT EIGHTEEN GREAT NOW WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS SIMPLY 
COUNT EIGHTEEN CARDS 
O. K. STAND BY HERE 
WE GO 
WHAT IS THE EIGHTEENTH CARD 
KING OF 
DIAMONDS 
PICK UP THE OTHER CARD I DIAMONDS PUT DOWN EARLIER 
NO WAY 
YOU KNOW 
IT'S COMING 
THE KING OF DIAMONDS 
THAT IS NOT MATHS THAT IS MAGIC 
I'M UTTERLY LOST IF YOU WANT TO 
FIND OUT HOW HE DID IT AND LEARN 
SOME MATHS MAGIC GO TO THE WEBSITE 
SOME MATHS MAGIC GO TO THE WEBSITE SIAN DO YOU GAMBLE 
NOT REALLY L. 
ONCE DID A POKER PROGRAMME AND 
LOVED THE PSYCHOLOGY OF IT 
YOU DO 
TAKE YOUR CHANCES WITH MEN L. THINK 
THAT IS A FAIR ENOUGH ASSUMPTION 
MOST FAMOUSLY LEMBIT OPIK THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT M. P. OF COURSE HE 
HAS WRITTEN ABOUT IT IN HE IS 
WRITTEN ABOUT IN YOUR BOOK IS HE 
AWARE OF THE CONTENTS HAVE YOU HAD 
ANY FEED BACK FROM HIM 
NO I'M 
HOPING WHEN HE SEES THE BOOK HE 
WILL BE PLEASED WITH THE CONTENT 
BECAUSE I THINK I'M VERY FAIR AND 
HONEST AND I'M NOT SO UNGENTLE ON 
HIM 
YOU STARTED WRITING IT BEFORE HIM THE RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM WAY WAY BEFORE 
IT COVERS CHILDHOOD AND BEFORE FIRST LOVE HE DOES TAKE A GOOD 
THIRD OF THE BOOK 
ABOUT A THIRD 
BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE 
VERY HONEST IT'S A BOOK ABOUT MY 
LIFE AND THE UPS AND DOWNS IT 
ENDED ON A BIG HIGH SO I THINK 
IT'S A VERY VERY POSITIVE BOOK 
POSITIVE I THINK BUT ALSO HAVING 
KIND OF READ IT IT SORT OF DOES 
LOOK LIKE A BIT OF A BOOK OF 
REVENGE OR ARE YOU GOING TO CALL 
IT THERAPY AS OPPOSED TO REVENGE 
NO REVENGE NO REGRETS L. DON'T 
NEED REVENGE I'M IN A GREAT PLACE 
AT THE MOMENT L. WASN'T GOING TO 
USE NEGATIVE ENERGY IN ANY WAY WHY 
WOULD I NEED REVENGE I'M NOT TO 
BLAME WHAT I DID DO WAS WORK 
THROUGH YOU TALK ABOUT THEERPUETIC 
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING 
YOU HAVE TO WORK THROUGH IT AND 
THAT IS WHAT I DID L. L. HAVE COME OUT 
A BETTER PERSON BEFORE THE BOOK I I THINK ALL GIRLS CERTAINLY MYSELF 
YOU ARE ALWAYS INTERESTED MAYBE IN 
WHO THE EX IS GOING OUT WITH AND 
YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT IN A VERY 
PUBLIC WAY THAT WAS DIFFICULT IF IF YOU ARE OUT OF A RELATIONSHIP AND 
EMOTIONALLY INDIFFERENT THEN IT'S 
NOT SO DIFFICULT AND AT LEAST I WAS 
OUT OF IT AND WAS A FEW PACES AWAY 
SO IT WASN'T SO BAD 
FOR THOSE THAT 
DON'T KNOW LEMBIT OPIK IS GOING OUT 
WITH A CHEEKY GIRL AND IS VERY 
VOCAL ABOUT THAT THAT IS QUITE A 
BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW IS IT NOT 
AS LONG AS HE'S HAPPY IN HIS 
COMFORT ZONE WHO AM I TO POINT THE 
FINGER OF BLAME I'M SURE THEY HAVE 
A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP 
YOU HAVE 
MOVED ON AND LANDED YOURSELF A 
LOVELY MAN GOT MARRIED AS WELL 
I I HAVE I WANT TO ASK YOU WHERE YOU HAVE HANG OUT POLITICIANS ARISTOCRATS 
AND MULTI MILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMEN 
AND JONATHAN ASHMAN YOUR HUSBAND 
WE HANG OUT IN DIFFERENT PLACES 
CAN YOU DIRECT ME PLEASE WHERE 
I'M GOING WRONG 
NO NOT AT ALL WE 
MEET PEOPLE ALL THE TIME IN MY JOB 
I MEET PEOPLE ALL THE TIME I'M 
ALWAYS OUT DOING THINGS AND 
PROGRAMMES AND I WRITE AND TRAVEL A 
LOT SO I MEET A LOT OF PEOPLE L. 
LOVE PEOPLE 
THAT COMES ACROSS IN 
THE BOOK WHICH IS OUT NEXT WEEK 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THERE ARE TWENTY THOUSAND WATER MILLS IN THE 
U. K. SOME ARE STILL WORKING SOME 
DERELICT BUT IN ONE THIRD WERE 
CONVERTED TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY 
WE COULD LIGHT UP OXFORD AND KNOCK 
DOWN A POWER STATION INTO THE 
BARGAIN LUCY SIEGLE HAS BEEN 
TESTING THE WATER IN RURAL 
MONMOUTHSHIRE THINK HYDRO ELECTRIC 
POWER AND WHAT COMES TO MIND 
MILLIONS OF LITRES OF WATER 
CASCADING THROUGH MASSIVE TURBINES 
BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO DAM AS ENTIRE 
VALLEY TO GENERATE ALL THE 
ELECTRICITY YOU NEED FOR DAILY LIFE 
AN ENTIRE VALLEY PAT RISHIA AND 
HER FAMILY MOVED TO THIS WELSH MILL 
HOUSE FOUR YEARS AGO PATRICIA IT 
WAS BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT BUT 
EXPENSIVE TO RUN WITH BOTH HER AND 
HER HUSBAND WORKING FROM HOME 
THEIR ANNUAL ELECTRICITY BILL WAS A 
PAINFUL EIGHT HUNDRED SOMETHING HAD TO GIVE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BIG ENERGY 
BILLS BUT WHERE DOES IT KICK IN 
WHEN YOU THINK I'LL GENERATE MY 
OWN 
WE 
HAD ALWAYS BEEN AWARE WE OWN HAD THIS STREAM RUSHING PAST AND WE 
KNEW WE WERE ON AN OLD MILL SITE 
AND THEY HAD USED IT IN THE PAST 
AND WE DISCOVERED THAT THERE HAD 
BEEN A SYSTEM IN THE TWENTIES AT OUR 
HOUSE SO WE THOUGHT WE OUGHT TO DO 
THIS AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO 
TO MAKE YOUR OWN HYDROELECTRICITY 
YOU WILL NEED ONE OF THESE THE 
WATER FLOW MUST BE GOOD AND YOU 
WILL NEED A DROP IN HEIGHT OF AT 
LEAST A COUPLE OF METRES PART OF 
THE STREAM THEN IS DIVERTED ALONG 
THIS PIPE AS WE SEE HERE IT FLOWS 
INTO THIS HYDRO ELECTRIC TURBINE 
YOU RUN A CABLE TO THE NATIONAL 
GRID AND YOU ARE IN BUSINESS WHAT 
WAS IT ACTUALLY LIKE WHEN THEY WERE 
DOING THE WORK AND PUTTING THE 
SYSTEM IN 
IT WAS QUITE AN ORDEAL 
IT WAS AN ADVENTURE WE HAD VARIOUS 
TROUBLES WITH THE BUILDING WORKS 
AND THE VERY FIRST DAY THE DIGGER 
SANK INTO THE THE SILT IN THE POND 
NOT A GOOD START NOT A GREAT START 
NO WE MANAGED TO GET IT OUT THAT 
NIGHT 
GENERATING YOUR OWN NIGHT ELECTRICITY IS A GREAT IDEA BUT 
ALL THIS WORK LOOKS EXPENSIVE IS 
THE OBJECT OF THE EXERCISE IS TO 
SAVE MONEY DO THE FIGURES STACK UP 
THE WHOLE THING COST A TOTAL OF 
AROUND TWELVE THOUSAND TO INSTALL AND THAT 
INCLUDEDED ALL THE EQUIPMENT WE 
HAVE NOW GOT TO THE STAGE WHERE WE 
PRODUCE ABOUT TWICE WHAT WE USE SO 
WE SELLECK TRISITY BACK TO THE GRID 
AND IT SHOULD START PAYING FOR 
ITSELF IN AROUND SIX YEARS 
YOU ARE 
PREPARED TO WAIT TO RECOUP THE 
COST 
YEAH L. THINK IT WILL BE COST WORTH THE WAIT 
BECAUSE YOU ARE 
GENERATING YOUR OWN ELECTRICITY 
DOESN'T IT MEAN YOU SQUANDER IT AND 
USE AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
EVER SINCE 
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE THE 
METRE GOING AROUND AND SEE HOW MUCH 
WE ARE GENERATING WE HAVE ACTUALLY 
BEEN A LOT MORE CAREFUL WITH OUR 
ELECTRICITY AND WE USE A LOT LESS 
THAN WE USED TO 
IN A WAY IT'S 
BECOME PRECIOUS TO YOU BECAUSE YOU 
CAN SEE HOW IT IS GENERATED I I THINK THAT IS IT BECAUSE WE CAN 
SEE THE SOURCE WE DON'T WANT TO 
WASTE A DROP OF IT 
YOU SEE THAT 
IS ALL VERY WELL IF YOU LIVE BESIDE 
A BROOKE BUT IF YOU ARE IN A FLAT 
IT'S NOT MUCH USE WHAT CAN I DO 
THEN 
WHAT YOU COULD DO IS CHANGE THEN YOUR TARIFF TO GREEN ELECTRICITY 
YOU COULD ACTUALLY GET YOUR 
ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY 
THAT IS VERY VERY EASY TO SWAP 
OVER 
THAT DOES HELP THE REST OF US OVER PEOPLE THAT CAN CONVERT 
YEAH CO TWO 
MOLECULES SAVED EVEN BY THEM HELPS 
EVERYBODY IF EVERYBODY COULD DO 
THAT DID IT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR 
ALL OF US 
WE HAVE SOME GADGETS 
THIS IS AN M. P. FOUR PLAYER IF CAN I 
WORK IT POSSIBLY YOU CAN WATCH 
YOUR FAVOURITE SHOW THIS IS THE 
ONE SHOW AND IT IS SOLAR POWERED 
THAT IS COOL 
I LOOK THAT THE TINY 
CARBON FOOTPRINT GETTING EVEN MORE 
MINUSCULE 
EXACTLY THIS IS A MINUSCULE WINDUP MUSIC PLAYER IT'S VERY 
VERY GREEN 
AS IN FOREVER BAYLISS 
EXACTLY IT PLAYS YOUR FAVOURITE 
TUNE IT DOESN'T IT WAS GOING TO 
PLAY OUR THEME TUNE 
GET SOME 
BATTERIES FOR IT IF YOU ARE AWARE 
ON HOLIDAY THAT IS QUITE USEFUL IF 
IT WORKS 
THIS IS LOVELY THIS IS A 
BEACH BAG WITH A MASSIVE SOLAR 
PANEL ON THE FRONT AND YOU CAN 
CHARGE 
IT'S NOT TERRIBLY TRENDY 
I WOULD PLUG MY PHONE INTO IT OR OR YOUR LAPTOP IF YOU WANTED TO WORK 
ON THE BEACH 
SHAME ON THAT WOULD 
YOU SEE YOURSELF WITH ONE OF THOSE 
I DON'T KNOW IT WOULD SAY YOU NEED 
YOU WOULD HAVE AN ADDICTION AND 
WE DON'T DO THOSE 
WHAT ARE THESE 
THEY ARE SOLAR POWERED ON THE TOP 
REALLY TRENDY YEAH GREAT THEY 
ARE NOT TOO BAD L. QUITE LIKE THAT 
THAT IS HOLIDAY DEVICES 
YOU CAN 
REDUCE YOUR FOOTPRINT 
THANK YOU 
FINALLY THE MOMENT OF TRUTH GILES
