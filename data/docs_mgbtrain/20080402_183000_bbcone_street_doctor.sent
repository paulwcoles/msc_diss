BINGE DRINKING IN THE CHESTER AREA IS HIGHER THAN THE ENGLAND AVERAGE 
IN A RECENT HEALTH SURVEY OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN CHESHIRE COMPLAINED OF ILL HEALTH 
THE INCIDENCE OF DIABETES IS ON THE INCREASE 
CASES WERE UP BY TWENTY PER CENT IN CHESTER ALONE IN THE LAST YEAR 
IT'S OUR DOCTORS' DUTY TO TURN THIS CITY AROUND 
ANYBODY NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR THERE'S UNUSUAL OBSERVATIONS 
IF THIS IS THE BREAST AND THIS IS THE NIPPLE 
CAPTIVATING LOCALS THERE YOU ARE ON YOU GO ENJOY IT 
AND SOME SCARY SYMPTOMS 
MY EYES STARTED TO GO SORT OF PRICKLY I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING AND STOPPED BEING ABLE TO HEAR 
TEEING OFF EARLY ARE DOCTOR JONTY AND DOCTOR BARBARA AT CARDEN PARK GOLF COURSE 
IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE THEY MEET A MAN IN NEED OF THEIR ADVICE 
I'VE JUST HAD A BIT OF A FALL RECENTLY 
I WAS UP MY LADDER AND IT JUST WENT LIKE THAT OOH HECK 
THE LEG WAS TRAPPED IN BETWEEN THE TWO RUNNERS IT'S VERY PUFFY 
I'M GOING ON HOLIDAY SHORTLY TO TENERIFE 
AND IT'S A FOUR HOUR FLIGHT AND I WONDERED IF IT MIGHT BE A BLOOD CLOT OR SOMETHING 
CAN WE TAKE YOUR SHOE AND SOCK OFF I THINK WE SHOULD CHECK THE ANKLE AS WELL 
DOES IT HURT WHEN I'M PRESSING ALONG HERE 
NO NOT REALLY 
I THINK YOU'VE GOT A HAEMATOMA UNDER THERE 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT'S LIKE A BLOOD CLOT REALLY UNDER THE SKIN 
YOU'VE NOT GOT ANY PAIN THERE HAVE YOU 
NO WHAT ABOUT BEHIND THE KNEE NO NO PAIN THERE NO 
A LOT OF PEOPLE GET CONFUSED A DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS TENDS TO BE IN THE BACK OF THE LEG AND CALF 
IT WILL OFTEN BECOME QUITE HARD AND SWOLLEN AND SOMETIMES TENDER 
SO THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE THIS IS CLEARLY WHERE YOU'VE HAD THE INJURY 
IN TERMS OF THE FLIGHT IF YOU WERE CONCERNED THEN ALL WE SUGGEST THESE DAYS OF STOCKINGS 
YOU CAN GET SOME NICE TIGHTS TO WEAR 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOT THE SORT YOUR WIFE WEARS 
NO THEY'VE GOT TO BE THEY'VE GOT TO BE THE COMPRESSION ONES 
FLIGHT STOCKINGS CAN I GET THEM ON THE NATIONAL HEALTH 
YOU CAN YEAH YOU CAN 
BACK IN THE CENTRE OF CHESTER DOCTOR GEORGE MEETS A PATIENT WITH AN ONGOING FOOT PROBLEM 
WHY IS IT YOU WANT TO SEE A STREET DOCTOR 
I'VE A FUNGAL TOE INFECTION THAT I'VE HAD FOR YEARS 
DO YOU AGREE THAT THAT'S WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WITH YOUR DAD 
YOU DON'T KNOW WILL I HAVE A LOOK THEN 
YES I AGREE WITH YOUR DAD'S DIAGNOSIS 
THAT DOES LOOK LIKE A FUNGAL INFECTION IN THE TOENAIL 
TO BE HONEST BILL MEN GET THAT A LOT DID YOU PLAY FOOTBALL YEAH I DID THAT'S RIGHT 
THE REASON I SAY THAT IS THAT OFTEN YOU FIND IF YOU'RE PLAYING FOOTBALL OR RUGBY 
AND THE TOENAIL BECOMES THAT WEE BIT DETACHED BECAUSE OF ALL THE IMPACT 
IT CAN LEAD TO FUNGUS INFECTION WITHIN THE TOENAIL YEAH 
HOW YOU TREAT THIS IS BY TABLET CALLED TERBINAFINE 
IF YOU TAKE THE TERBINAFINE YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE IT FOR WOULD YOU BELIEVE UP TO ABOUT FOUR MONTHS 
THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT YOU'VE GOT A VERY POOR BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE NAIL 
THERE YOU ARE THAT'S IT IT WILL RESOLVE IT 
ONCE YOU ARE BETTER YOU CAN GET BACK TO YOUR FIVE A SIDE FOOTBALL AND START SCORING THE GOALS AGAIN 
MEANWHILE DOCTOR AYAN'S SURGERY SETS SAIL ON THE BEAUTIFUL WATERS OF THE RIVER DEE 
ANYONE HERE WANT TO SEE A DOCTOR AT ALL 
WHERE HE MEETS A PATIENT WHO IS CONVINCED SHE'S LOSING HER HAIR 
LOOKING AT YOUR HAIR FROM WHERE I AM IT DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD 
UNDER STRONG LIGHTING YOU WILL SEE MY SCALP 
A LOT OF PEOPLE NOTICE THAT AT NIGHT TIME 
ALSO AFTER I'VE HAD A BATH I COME DOWNSTAIRS AND TOWEL DRY MY HAIR 
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT I LOOK LIKE A DROWNED RAT BASICALLY 
IT'S REALLY EMBARRASSING IT'S NOT NICE 
DO YOU MIND IF I HAVE A LOOK SURE 
YOU CAN SEE MY SCALP QUITE EASILY COMPARED TO OTHER GIRLS 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE DENSITY OF HAIR IS NOT AS THICK IT IS IT'S THE DENSITY OF THE HAIR 
DO YOU DYE YOUR HAIR AT ALL 
IN THE PAST I DID WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN I DYED IT A LOT 
YEAH I HAD TO BLEACH IT I WENT PINK BLUE AND ALL SORTS O. K. 
THAT'S IMPORTANT WE MUSTN'T IGNORE THAT 
THE OTHER THING THERE ARE LOTS OF HORMONES THAT CAN AFFECT THE HEALTH OF YOUR HAIR 
SOME OF THEM ARE SEX HORMONES LIKE OESTROGEN PROGESTERONE 
THE OTHER IS SOMETHING CAUGHT YOUR THYROID GLAND OH YES 
HAVE YOU HAD THAT CHECKED I HAVE IT'S NORMAL APPARENTLY 
THAT'S GOOD IF YOUR THYROID IS NORMAL AND YOU'VE USED HAIR DYES IN THE PAST 
IT'S PROBABLY I'M AFRAID TO SAY A RESULT OF THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
MY MUM WILL JUST SAY I TOLD YOU SO NOW 
I CAN JUST SEE IT NOW 
IF YOU ARE A WOMAN WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT HAIR LOSS DOCTOR AYAN ADVISES CUT DOWN THE NUMBER AND FREQUENCY 
OF HAIR STYLING PRODUCTS YOU USE ON A REGULAR BASIS 
TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT YOUR DIET AND LIFESTYLE 
POOR NUTRITION CAN HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON HAIR 
LOOK AT THE STRESS LEVELS IN YOUR LIFE AND WHETHER YOU CAN REDUCE THEM 
IF YOU NEED FURTHER HELP VISIT YOUR G. P. 
THE STREET DOCTORS ARE ON A CAMPAIGN TO PUT HEALTH AT THE TOP OF EVERYONE'S PRIORITY LIST 
AND IN CHESTER NO PAVEMENT OR PATIENT IS OFF LIMITS 
IS IT COMFORTABLE IT'S COMFORTABLE IT'S NOT PAINFUL AT ALL 
BACK AT THE GOLF COURSE DOCTOR JONTY TAKES TIME OUT FROM LAUGHING AT DOCTOR BARBARA'S SWING 
TO MEET A PAINTER AND DECORATOR WITH AN EMBARRASSING PROBLEM 
I'VE BEEN GETTING LOTS OF WIND JUST AFTER I'VE EATEN REALLY 
WHEN YOU SAY WIND ARE YOU ALSO FARTING A LOT 
NO MORE THAN I USUALLY GET IT PROBABLY LASTS A BIT LONGER O. K. 
FINE HAVE YOU HAVE ANY LOOSE STOOLS OR DIARRHOEA 
NO I'VE GOT HEALTHY BOWELS HEALTHY BOWELS I RECKON YOU RECKON SO 
YOU SOUND VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT THAT GOOD 
IT'S GOING TO BE HELPFUL FOR ME TO EXAMINE YOUR ABDOMEN TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WOULD THAT BE ALL RIGHT 
FEET DOWN THAT END DO YOU WANT TO 
YOU JUST TELL ME IF YOU'RE GETTING ANY PAIN OR DISCOMFORT 
DEEP BREATH IN 
AND OUT 
DEEP BREATH IN 
AND OUT I'M JUST CHECKING FOR YOUR LIVER NOW 
O. K. GOOD 
CAN I GET YOU TO STAND BACK UP AGAIN 
I'M REASSURED THAT IT ISN'T ANYTHING SINISTER OR WORRYING THAT'S GOING ON 
HAS ANYTHING ELSE CHANGED 
STRESS LEVELS WORK ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
I PROBABLY DON'T GIVE MYSELF ENOUGH TIME AFTER EATING BEFORE I START WORKING 
SO YOU TEND TO EAT QUITE QUICKLY 
THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT PEOPLE TEND TO GET MORE WIND 
A LOT OF THE WIND IS ACTUALLY SWALLOWED AIR YES 
IF YOU GULP YOUR FOOD DOWN YOU WILL TEND TO GET A LOT MORE FLATULENCE AND BLOATING ASSOCIATED WITH IT 
TRY ADJUSTING YOUR DIET A LITTLE BIT AND IT MAY BE WORTH KEEPING A DIARY 
OF WHAT SORT OF FOODS YOU'VE EATEN WHEN IT TENDS TO BE WORSE 
THE OTHER THING I'D SAY IS TRY SOMETHING QUITE SIMPLE SAY IN EVENING LIKE PEPPERMINT TEA 
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME IS THAT ALL RIGHT YEAH 
IF IT PERSISTS YOU MUST GO BACK AND SEE YOUR G. P. 
WILL DO THANKS A LOT I'D BETTER LEAVE YOU TO GET ON 
DOWN BY THE WATER'S EDGE DOCTOR AYAN MEETS UP WITH EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD JO WHO HAS A WORRYING LIST OF CONCERNS 
I'VE BEEN HAVING REALLY REALLY BAD HEADACHES 
I WAS WAITING AT MY BUS STOP FOR THE BUS A WHILE AGO 
AND ALL THE SUDDEN MY EYES STARTED TO GO PRICKLY I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING 
IT WENT WHITE I STOPPED BEING ABLE TO HEAR AND I GOT REALLY HOT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS REALLY COLD 
I PASSED OUT AND THE NEXT THING WAS THE BUS DRIVER LIKE ARE YOU O. K. 
I WAS LIKE O. K. THIS IS STRANGE WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THEN 
THE HEADACHES HAVE GOT A LOT WORSE AND THIS EYE AS WELL I CAN'T REALLY SEE OUT OF THAT SIDE OF IT 
IT'S A BIT BLURRY 
AND IT'S STILL LIKE THAT YEAH 
SO YOU CAN'T SEE PROPERLY OUT OF YOUR LEFT EYE NO O. K. 
HAVE YOU SEEN A DOCTOR ABOUT IT ALREADY NO YOU'RE JOKING 
THAT SURPRISES ME BECAUSE THEY SOUND LIKE VERY ODD SYMPTOMS 
DOES ANYONE IN YOUR FAMILY GET MIGRAINES MUM OR DAD 
DO YOU TAKE ANY MEDICATION ARE YOU ON A PILL OF ANY SORT NO YOU'RE NOT ON THE CONTRACEPTIVE PILL 
THE REASON I ASK IS OFTEN THE PILL CAN CAUSE MIGRAINES AND SOME OF WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING 
SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT 
WITH SUCH A SERIOUS LIST OF SYMPTOMS DOCTOR AYAN DECIDES TO GIVE JO A THOROUGH HEALTH CHECK 
I'M GOING TO START BY LOOKING IN YOUR EYES WITH THIS THING AN OPHTHALMOSCOPE 
JUST PUSH UP AGAINST MY ARMS THAT'S VERY GOOD DOWN 
THAT'S GREAT 
I'M JUST GOING TO TICKLE THE BOTTOM OF YOUR FEET 
IT'S A REALLY WEIRD STORY BECAUSE SOME OF THE FEATURES YOU HAVE 
SOUND VERY MUCH LIKE MIGRAINE 
AND MIGRAINE IS THE KIND OF HEADACHE THAT CAN GIVE VISUAL DISTURBANCE 
SOMETIMES EVEN MAKE YOU LOSE YOUR SIGHT TEMPORARILY 
YOU CERTAINLY DON'T GET HEARING LOSS AND A COLLAPSE WITH IT 
PLUS YOUR VISION IS STILL DISTURBED 
AND THAT DOES WORRY ME A LITTLE BIT 
I OUGHT TO REFER YOU TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST 
WHO IS A DOCTOR THAT REALLY SPECIALISES IN FOR WANT OF A BETTER PHRASE NERVE MEDICINE 
JUST FOR A SECOND OPINION ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT 
I'LL TELL YOU WHY YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT A SERIOUS SYMPTOM THAT'S WORRYING YOU 
AND I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN ANSWER AND SAY IT'S DEFINITELY MIGRAINE OR IT'S DEFINITELY WHATEVER 
WE'LL SORT THAT OUT AND THEN WE'LL MEET UP LATER EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT 
NICE TALKING TO YOU THANK YOU NO WORRIES 
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY DOCTOR BARBARA'S GETTING TO GRIPS 
WITH A FINE ART OF SPEEDY SANDWICH MAKING 
MORE FASTER FASTER FASTER 
ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE HER MEDICAL SKILLS ARE ALSO PUT TO USE I HAVE A SNORING PROBLEM SNORING 
YES I DO I HOPE YOU DON'T SNORE ON DUTY 
NO I DO SNORE YEAH 
AND ALSO I DO SMOKE 
WELL ALI I THINK WE OUGHT TO TALK ABOUT THIS 
SHALL WE GO SOMEWHERE WHERE IT'S LESS NOISY THAT'D BE GREAT O. K. FANTASTIC 
HOW LOUD IS IT I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T CHECKED IT IN A DECIBEL MACHINE 
SOMETIMES MY PARTNER HAS TO WAKE ME UP PLEASE STOP IT I CAN'T SLEEP 
GENERALLY PEOPLE SNORE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE DANGLY BIT AT THE BACK OF THE THROAT 
WE CALL IT THE UVULA 
THAT PART OF THE PALATE BECOMES WEAKER 
AND IF YOU'RE SMOKING AND IT'S AFFECTING YOUR BREATHING 
AND IT'S AFFECTING YOUR NASAL PASSAGES 
THEN THAT WOULD MAKE YOUR SNORING WORSE 
NOW ALI THAT'S FOR TEN CIGARETTES A DAY IN A YEAR IN A YEAR 
AND YOU SMOKE TWENTY IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
IMAGINE THE ACCUMULATION IN YOUR LUNGS 
THAT'S DISGUSTING 
IT IS DISGUSTING ISN'T IT IT IS 
THERE IS A TEST WE CAN DO 
WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHETHER YOU HAVE ACTUALLY DAMAGED YOUR LUNGS WITH THE SMOKING 
SO I'M SORRY ALI YOU'RE IN FOR IT 
AS DOCTOR BARBARA CONTINUES HER CONSULTATION 
DOCTOR JONTY IS MEETING MORE PATIENTS AT CHESHIRE ICE CREAM FARM 
WHERE HE SEES A MAN WITH A RECURRING AND PAINFUL SPORTS INJURY 
YOU WERE PLAYING FOOTBALL WHAT HAPPENED 
I JUST WENT FOR THE BALL 
IT WAS A SUDDEN TURN OF DIRECTION AND MY KNEE SEEMED TO GO ONE WAY AND I WENT THE OTHER 
OUCH IT SEEMED TO SLIP OUT 
SO HOW IS IT AFFECTING LIFE AT HOME AT THE MOMENT AWFUL IS IT WHY 
I SAID TO HIM TO GO BACK TO SEE HIS G. P. BUT HE SAID NO HE'LL JUST TELL HIM IT'S SWELLING AGAIN 
BUT IT'S NOT HE COULD BE RUNNING AROUND THE HOUSE WITH THE GIRLS AND HE JUST GOES 
HE'S JUST ON THE FLOOR AND THEN A FEW CHOICE WORDS COME OUT 
I GIVE HIM A GOOD BOOT AND SAY GET ON WITH THE DISHES 
SO IT DOESN'T STOP HIM DOING THE WASHING UP NO NOT AT ALL I GOT HIM A CHAIR THAT HE CAN SIT ON 
EXCELLENT THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR 
CAN YOU PULL YOUR TROUSERS UP 
I CAN GET THEM SO FAR THEN IT'S 
NOW THAT'S WELL IT'S NOT GREAT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK CAN WE GET HIM DOWN TO HIS BOXERS 
THAT'S IT GREAT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M JUST GOING TO MOVE IT AROUND A BIT 
ALL RIGHT YEAH ARE YOU GETTING ANY PAIN AT ALL NO NO 
NO NONE AT ALL 
I'M JUST GOING TO SIT ON YOUR FOOT AND I'M GOING TO PULL YEAH 
WHAT I'M DOING WHEN I DO THIS IS I'M TESTING THE LIGAMENTS 
THE CRUCHET LIGAMENTS THE ANTERIOR CRUCHET HERE 
THE CRUCHETS ARE ALL RIGHT 
THE COLLATERAL LIGAMENTS THE KNEE JOINT ITSELF IS QUITE STABLE 
BETWEEN THOSE TWO BONES WHICH MAKE UP THE KNEE JOINT 
THERE IS A SHOCK ABSORBER WE CALL THE MENISCUS O. K. 
NOW THAT CAN GET DAMAGED OR TORN 
IF THAT HAPPENS YOU CAN GET A KIND OF GIVING WAY 
AND YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO YOUR DOCTOR 
YOU MAY NEED TO HAVE WHAT IS CALLED AN M. R. I. SCAN OF THE KNEE DONE 
I DON'T WANT YOU TO END UP NOT BEING ABLE TO EXERCISE 
THAT'S THE WORST OF ALL WORLDS YOU PUT ON WEIGHT 
YOU PUT MORE STRAIN ON THE KNEE AND IT'LL GET WORSE 
YOUR LIFE JUST BECOMES ONE BIG VICIOUS CIRCLE THEN EXACTLY 
ALL RIGHT BRILLIANT THANKS FOR YOUR TIME NOT AT ALL YOU BETTER PULL YOUR TROUSERS UP I WILL 
AS DOCTOR JONTY CONTINUES HIS SUNNY SURGERY 
YOU ARE LOSING IT IN OTHER PLACES AS WELL AREN'T YOU 
THE OTHER DOCTORS ARE WORKING HARD TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH OF CHESTER 
THEY'RE DIAGNOSING OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS IT FEELS LIKE A TON WEIGHT ON YOUR HEAD 
AND GRAPPLING WITH MYSTERIOUS SYMPTOMS THERE'S NOTHING MUCH TO SEE THERE 
I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE CAN'T STOP SNEEZING 
OUTSIDE THE SANDWICH FACTORY DOCTOR BARBARA IS TESTING SMOKER ALI'S LUNG CAPACITY 
DETERMINED TO SHOCK HIM INTO CHANGING HIS HABITS 
THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO 
AND HOLD ON TO IT 
BLOW QUICKLY 
KEEP IT GOING KEEP IT GOING KEEP IT GOING 
OOH ALI ALI ALI NOT GETTING ANYWHERE NEAR 
NO WELL IT'S IT'S PROBABLY MY TECHNIQUE IT MUST BE 
IT COULD BE OR IT COULD BE THE FACT THAT YOU SMOKE I SMOKE 
OH MY GOD IT'S GETTING WORSE YOU SEE YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF PUFF 
YEAH IT'S NOWHERE NEAR IN THE GRAPH 
AND THE REASON IS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THAT SHAPE 
BUT YOURS WAS DOWN HERE AND HAD A SLIGHT FLATTENING TO IT 
SO I SUSPECT THAT YOUR LUNGS ARE PROBABLY TEN YEARS OLDER THAN THEY SHOULD BE 
DO YOU THINK IT'LL MAKE YOU STOP 
WELL IT WILL DEFINITELY AFTER THAT TEST AND SEEING THE RESULT 
YOU RAN OUT OFF PUFF QUITE QUICKLY DIDN'T YOU 
I DID DIDN'T I 
AND THE OTHER THING IS I KNOW WE'VE GONE OFF ON A TANGENT A BIT 
WITH THE SMOKING AND YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR SNORING 
SO IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE YOU ASKING FOR AN OPINION FROM AN EAR NOSE AND THROAT DOCTOR 
TO SEE WHETHER THEY CAN HELP WITH YOUR SNORING 
DON'T PUT UP WITH IT IT'S GOING TO RESTRICT YOUR LIFE AND YOUR PARTNER'S GOING TO LEAVE 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON YOUR OWN SMOKING 
WHAT A MISERABLE FUTURE GET IT SORTED 
THANK YOU 
DOCTOR BARBARA SAYS ON AVERAGE IT TAKES UP TO EIGHT ATTEMPTS TO STOP SMOKING 
CHOOSE A METHOD WHICH SUITS YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES 
WHETHER IT IS PATCHES TABLETS GUM OR AN INHALATOR 
IF NECESSARY ATTEND AN INTENSIVE SUPPORT SERVICE 
AT YOUR LOCAL G. P. CLINIC 
HAVE A TIMESCALE IN MIND 
IF YOU'RE STILL STRUGGLING SEE YOUR G. P. FOR FURTHER HELP AND SUPPORT 
DOCTOR GEORGE AND DOCTOR IAN HAVE TEAMED UP AND ARE ENJOYING THE SUNNY WEATHER AT CHESTER ZOO 
WE NEED A PICK ME UP ACTUALLY IAN YEAH 
THEY'VE ALL GONE NOW YOU'VE SCARED THEM OFF AS BAD AS THAT 
WHILST DOCTOR IAN LOOKS FOR PATIENTS IN THE MARMOTS' HOUSE DOCTOR GEORGE MEETS A YOUNG BOY WITH AN ITCHY RASH 
WELL YOUNG ALEX YOU HAVE A RASH IS THAT RIGHT 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THAT FOR 
UM A FEW MONTHS A FEW MONTHS 
LITTLE SPOTS THERE MUM TO ME THAT LOOKS LIKE AN ECZEMA ON THE SKIN 
AN ECZEMA WHERE PARTS OF IT HAVE BECOME INFECTED 
ALMOST AS IF THEY ARE SLIGHTLY PUS Y. AND CRUSTY 
HAS HE NOT HAD CREAMS FROM YOUR OWN G. P. TO APPLY TO THIS 
NO I'VE BEEN USING I GAVE HIM SUDOCREM TO PUT ON 
AND THEN BECAUSE IT'S ITCHY AS WELL I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO 
SO THEN I TRIED EURAX AN ANTI INFLAMMATORY CREAM 
EURAX IS AN ANTI ITCH CREAM YOU'RE RIGHT 
BECAUSE IT LOOKS INFECTED AS WELL I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH TO USE 
IT CERTAINLY DOES LOOK A BIT INFECTED 
WHAT I THINK WOULD BENEFIT YOUNG ALEX WOULD BE A MILD STEROID CREAM 
WHICH HAS GOT AN ANTIBIOTIC IN IT 
MAYBE TAKING AN ANTI HISTAMINE AN ANTI ALLERGY TABLET FOR A FEW DAYS WOULD TAKE THE ITCH OUT 
AFTER THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO REALLY APPLY LIBERALLY 
IS SOME SORT OF EMOLLIENT CREAM 
YOU GET LOTS OF CHOICES OF THOSE FROM THE CHEMIST 
BUT YOU WILL SETTLE DOWN DON'T WORRY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE YOUR LEG 
I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT 
YOU CAN NIP ALONG AND SEE THE GIRAFFES AND THE MONKEYS 
AND BE PERFECTLY HAPPY THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT 
HAPPY WITH THAT GREAT SEEING YOU 
STILL AT THE ICE CREAM FARM DOCTOR JONTY'S TAKING A QUICK BREAK 
FANTASTIC IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU IN EXCHANGE 
ANYONE NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR 
HIS TIME OUT COMES TO AN ABRUPT HALT WHEN HE MEETS A MAN WITH A SERIOUS CONCERN 
I'VE GOT THIS LUMP BEHIND MY EAR 
I CAUGHT IT SHAVING AND SINCE THEN IT'S NEVER HEALED 
THE LUMP APPEARED HOW LONG AGO THREE MONTHS FOUR MONTHS AGO 
I JUST HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO GO AND SEE THE DOCTOR 
IT'S A GOOD JOB YOU BUMPED INTO ME ISN'T IT YES 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS LUMP JUST TURN YOUR HEAD A BIT THE LIGHT IS QUITE GOOD 
O. K. ARE YOU SOMEONE WHO'S SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE SUN IN THE PAST 
JUST HOLIDAY SUNBATHING 
WELL LOOK UM I AM QUITE WORRIED ABOUT THAT RIGHT 
ALL RIGHT THE REASON IS ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT ISN'T HEALING 
IS CONCERNING TO ME AS A DOCTOR WHEN I LOOK AT IT 
IT'S GOT QUITE SMOOTH EDGES THAT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE ROLLED OVER 
AND IT HAS THIS SLIGHT ULCERATION IN THE CENTRE 
WHAT THAT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT AS A DOCTOR IS A SOMETHING CALLED A BASAL CELL CARCINOMA 
WHICH IS WORRYING BECAUSE IT HAS THE WORD CANCER IN IT CARCINOMA YEAH 
I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE REMOVED AND SENT OFF TO THE LAB TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT IT IS 
ITS APPEARANCE TO ME IS THAT POSSIBLY OF A SKIN CANCER 
IT DOESN'T SPREAD TO OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY LIKE A MELANOMA DOES SO FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW 
IT'S MUCH BETTER TO HAVE THAT THAN THE MORE WORRYING TYPES OF CANCER LIKE MELANOMA 
BUT IT CAN STILL SPREAD TO THE SURROUNDING AREA AND THAT CAN BECOME PROBLEMATIC 
YOU NEED TO GO AND SEE A DOCTOR A. S. A. P. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU 
GO AND SEE THE DOCTOR WILL DO 
THE SUN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NINETY PER CENT OF ALL SKIN CANCERS 
IF YOU WANT TO REDUCE YOUR RISK DOCTOR JONTY ADVISES 
CHESTER CONTINUES TO KEEP OUR DOCTORS BUSY 
SEARCHING EVERY STREET TO MAKE SURE NO PATIENT IS LEFT UNTREATED 
SEEMS TO ME AS IF YOU HAVE ALMOST GONE TEN ROUNDS WITH MIKE TYSON IS THAT RIGHT 
AT THE CHESHIRE OAKS OUTLET VILLAGE 
THERE'S NO TIME FOR BARGAIN HUNTING AS DOCTOR BARBARA BUMPS INTO ANOTHER PATIENT 
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I HAD AN ACCIDENT AND BROKE MY WRIST O. K. 
DID YOU FALL I WAS ROLLER SKATING WERE YOU 
I THINK THAT'S GREAT I WOULD LOVE TO DO A BIT OF THAT MYSELF 
THE LAST TWO TO THREE WEEKS 
I HAVE HAD REALLY BAD PAIN JUST ROUND THIS AREA O. K. 
WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS WHETHER IT'S ARTHRITIS NOW SETTING IN 
OR IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED O. K. 
WHAT ABOUT BENDING YOUR WRIST 
I AM GETTING PAIN THERE 
THIS IS WHERE THE SWELLING IS ISN'T IT 
I THINK IT WOULD ALMOST BE WORTHWHILE 
X. RAYING THAT 
JUST TO SEE WHETHER YOU HAVE GOT ANY RESIDUAL PROBLEM AS A RESULT OF YOUR FALL 
MAYBE IN THE MEANTIME USE A WRIST SUPPORT EVERY DAY 
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND IT MAY SETTLE DOWN 
OH RIGHT THAT'S GOOD ADVICE HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ANYTHING EXCESSIVE RECENTLY 
UM DECORATING AH 
THAT WOULD PROBABLY DO IT YOU MIGHT FIND YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE ANYTHING DONE 
IF YOU TAKE SOME PAINKILLERS AND WEAR THAT MOST OF THE TIME 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH HOPE I'VE HELPED 
IT'S TIME TO CALL IT A DAY FOR DOCTOR BARBARA 
BUT DOCTOR GEORGE NIPS OVER OVER THE BORDER TO WALES 
THERE HE MEETS A CHOIR MEMBER WITH A CONDITION THAT'S PLAYING HAVOC WITH HIS SOCIAL LIFE 
I GET THIS CHRONIC HEARTBURN PARTICULARLY WHEN I'VE HAD A GLASS OF WINE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YOU DON'T SMOKE DO YOU FRASER 
NO AND YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT ALCOHOL DOES IT HAPPEN WITH SPICY FOODS 
LIKE PICKLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
TO BE HONEST I HAVEN'T NOTICED IT WITH THAT 
YOU DID MENTION THE WORD ACID 
YOU ARE GETTING THIS BURNING ROLLING SENSATION 
RIGHT UP TO THE BACK OF MY THROAT 
CAN I JUST LOOK AT YOUR TUMMY JUST FOR A SEC 
WE'LL MOVE RIGHT O. K. 
IF YOU CAN JUST TURN YOURSELF ROUND 
WE WILL PULL THIS UP IF YOU DON'T MIND IS THAT O. K. FRASER 
JUST ROLL THAT UP EVER SO SLIGHTLY YOU ARE A DOCTOR AREN'T YOU 
I AM A DOCTOR NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO JUST PALPATE YOUR TUMMY 
THAT'S NOT PARTICULARLY TENDER IS IT THAT'S GOOD 
UP YOU COME UP YOU COME 
DOCTOR GEORGE HAS A NIFTY TRICK UP HIS SLEEVE 
TO SHOW FRASER JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING IN HIS STOMACH 
I HAVE GOT THIS BOTTLE OF FIZZY POP 
YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THIS IS THE ACID IN THE STOMACH 
JUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I PUT THE MINT INTO THE FIZZY POP 
YOU SEE THE BUILD UP 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN YOUR STOMACH 
THE ACID WHICH SHOULD BE TOTALLY WITHIN THE STOMACH 
IS STARTING TO COME INTO THE BASE OF THE GULLET AND ONCE IT IS THERE 
IT CAN'T GET BACK 
IT IS IRRITATING THE BASE OF THE GULLET AND SETTING UP THIS TREMENDOUS HEARTBURN DISCOMFORT 
IT CAN BE PAIN AND CAN GO ALL THE WAY UP TO THE BACK OF THE THROAT 
WHAT YOU HAVE GOT TO DO IS GO AND SEE YOUR OWN G. P. 
AND HE OR SHE WILL GIVE YOU ACID SUPPRESSING DRUGS 
I AM SURE BEFORE LONG YOU WILL BE HAVING YOUR OCCASIONAL WINE WITH YOUR MEAL 
AND ABSOLUTELY NO MEDICAL PROBLEMS AT ALL 
I WISH YOU ALL THE VERY BEST 
O. K. THANK YOU DOCTOR GEORGE GREAT MEETING YOU 
THE CHESTER SURGERY IS COMING TO AN END BUT DOCTOR IAN HAS JUST ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH UP WITH ONE LAST PATIENT 
HOW ARE YOU NICE TO SEE YOU JO 
LAST TIME HE SAW JO HE WAS SO CONCERNED BY HER FAINTING AND MIGRAINES 
HE REFERRED HER TO A SPECIALIST 
NOW THE RESULTS OF HER BRAIN SCAN ARE BACK 
THAT BIT THAT LOOKS LIKE A CAULIFLOWER IS THE CEREBELLUM 
THAT CONTROLS BALANCE AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
THE GOOD NEWS IS EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL SO THAT'S EXCELLENT 
OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE STILL LEFT WITH THE SYMPTOMS 
HOW HAVE THINGS BEEN SINCE WE LAST MET 
THEY HAVE BEEN O. K. I'VE STILL BEEN GETTING THE HEADACHES A LOT 
MIGRAINE WHICH IS THE FIRST THING THAT IS WHAT IS GIVING YOU YOUR HEADACHES 
IT TENDS TO RUN IN FAMILIES COMES ON AFTER CERTAIN TRIGGERS 
BOOZE IS ONE OF THEM DO YOU DRINK A LOT 
NOT A LOT A LITTLE BIT 
A BIT NOW AND AGAIN 
CAFFEINE IS ANOTHER ONE 
SOMETIMES THINGS LIKE STRESS IF YOU'RE TIRED THOSE KIND OF THINGS 
THE SECOND THING IS THESE FUNNY EPISODES 
WHERE YOU'RE FAINTING OR COLLAPSING REALLY WORRYING 
I THINK THEY ARE WHAT WE CALL SYNCOPAL EPISODES 
WHICH ARE FAIRLY COMMON IN YOUNG WOMEN 
THEY ARE BROUGHT ABOUT BY EMOTIONAL STRESS 
EXCITEMENT OR SOMETIMES BY EXERCISE 
THINK ABOUT WHETHER YOU'VE HAD LATE NIGHTS OR HAVE BEEN DRINKING MORE BOOZE THAN NORMAL 
OR BEEN DRINKING MORE COFFEE THAN NORMAL AND WHETHER THAT HAS ANY EFFECT ON THESE THINGS 
YOU CAN ELIMINATE THEM AND HOPEFULLY FEEL BETTER THAT'S IT REALLY 
HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW DO YOU FEEL MORE REASSURED BETTER 
I FEEL A LOT BETTER THERE IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT WHICH IS DEFINITELY REASSURING 
YOU ARE GOING TO TRY THOSE THINGS AREN'T YOU THE DIARY AND KEEPING A NOTE 
DEFINITELY PROMISE I PROMISE 
EXCELLENT NICE TO SEE YOU GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING 
THE SURGERY IS FINALLY FINISHED 
WHAT ARE THE STREET DOCTORS' THOUGHTS ON THIS HISTORIC CITY 
EVEN THOUGH CHESTER HAS THIS WELL DESERVED REPUTATION OF BEING A HEALTHY PLACE TO LIVE 
YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT WE'VE SEEN ONE OR TWO PEOPLE WHO NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR AND HAVE INTERESTING PROBLEMS 
ABSOLUTELY IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW HEALTHY A PLACE IS 
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO NEED MEDICAL INPUT OR MEDICAL ADVICE 
I WENT TO THE SANDWICH FACTORY AND MET A CHAP CALLED ALI 
HE WAS TRYING TO GIVE UP SMOKING 
I AM HOPING WHAT REALLY PUT HIM OFF WAS A JAR OF TAR I SHOWED HIM 
IF HE QUIT WE KNOW HE'LL LIVE ABOUT EIGHT YEARS LONGER 
FANTASTIC WHAT A GREAT THING TO DO I HOPE HE QUITS 
SINCE THE STREET DOCTORS' VISIT TO CHESTER MILTON HAS TAKEN DOCTOR JONTY'S ADVICE 
HE HAS BEEN EATING MORE SLOWLY AND AT A REASONABLE TIME 
HIS SYMPTOMS ARE GETTING BETTER 
MALCOLM HAS BEEN TO A SPECIALIST 
HAD THE GROWTH REMOVED AND IS WAITING THE RESULTS OF A BIOPSY 
SANDWICH EXPERT ALI GAVE UP SMOKING THE DAY AFTER HE MET DOCTOR BARBARA 
FIRST THING I PICKED UP ALL THE CIGARETTES I HAVE GOT LEFT 
THREW THEM IN THE BIN I FELT A LOT MORE ENERGETIC MORE FULL OF LIFE IF YOU LIKE 
I OWE A HUGE THANK YOU TO DOCTOR BARBARA FOR HER ADVICE AND HELP REALLY
