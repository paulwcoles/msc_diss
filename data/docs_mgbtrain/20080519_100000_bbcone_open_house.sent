WITH THREE DAYS UNTIL OUR OPEN HOUSE THE KIDS HAVE BEEN ROPED IN TO HELP CLEAN THEIR BEDROOMS 
PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS ARE VERY TRADITIONAL 
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE THAT SALE 
IT'S RADICAL AND IT'S RISKY BUT IF IT WORKS OUT 
YOU COULD WIND UP WITH A LOT MORE THAN JUST YOUR ASKING PRICE 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WELCOME TO OPEN HOUSE 
HOW DOES IT WORK 
WE'LL TAKE ONE DESIRABLE PROPERTY 
AND STAGE IT FOR A ONE OFF OPEN DAY EVENT TO WHICH 
WE'LL INVITE THE BEST POSSIBLE BUYERS 
AND ASK THEM TO PUT IN THEIR BEST AND FINAL OFFERS BY THE END OF THAT VERY SAME DAY 
IT SOUNDS STRAIGHTFORWARD ENOUGH ALL WE NEED NOW IS TO FIND THAT PERFECT PROPERTY 
I'VE BEEN PROPERTY DEVELOPING FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS 
AND TODAY I'VE COME TO BRIGHTON ON THE SUSSEX COAST TO HELP A FAMILY SELL THEIR HOME 
PROPERTY HERE IS IN BIG DEMAND AND WHILE THE CITY'S MANY REGENCY BUILDINGS 
OFFER A WIDE CHOICE OF CONVERTED FLATS FAMILY HOUSES ARE IN MUCH SHORTER SUPPLY 
WHICH IS WHY THIS AREA OF BRIGHTON KNOWN AS THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE WITH ITS WIDE OPEN GREEN SPACES 
AND COMMUNITY ATMOSPHERE HAS GOT FAMILIES QUEUING UP TO BUY HERE 
LAST MONTH WHEN A FOUR BED TERRACE CAME ON THE MARKET IT WAS SNAPPED UP IN A MATTER OF HOURS 
AND WORD ON THE STREET IS ANOTHER OF THESE HIGHLY DESIRABLE PROPERTIES IS ABOUT TO GO UP FOR SALE 
I CAN CERTAINLY SEE WHY THIS AREA IS POPULAR WITH FAMILIES 
OVER THERE YOU'VE GOT A PARK WITH TENNIS COURTS AND A PLAYGROUND 
AND HERE IS THE PROPERTY ITSELF 
REALLY GOOD KERB APPEAL VERY WELL PRESENTED 
AND THIS PATH AND THIS DOOR JUST BECKONS YOU IN FOR MORE DOESN'T IT 
AND THROUGH THE DOOR THERE'S ALREADY A SENSE OF LIGHT AND SPACE WITH THE PROPERTY GOING THAT WAY 
BUT WHAT I LIKE STRAIGHT AWAY IS THE DETAIL WITH THE KIND OF LEADED GLASS HERE 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN THIS PROPERTY AND I'M KEEN TO SEE WHAT FIRST IMPRESSION IT MAKES ON ME 
AND WHAT I CAN DO TO MAKE THINGS LOOK EVEN BETTER 
THE NEXT GREAT FEATURE OF COURSE IS THAT FIRE PLACE THERE 
I LIKE THE WAY ALL THE VICTORIAN DOORS HAVE BEEN DIPPED AND STRIPPED 
AND IT'S ROUND ABOUT NOW ONE HAS TO ASK ONESELF WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE 
BEHIND THOSE STRIPPED DOORS THIS SECOND RECEPTION ROOM CURRENTLY DOUBLES AS AN OFFICE 
WHILE IT'S A BONUS I DON'T THINK THEY'RE MAKING THE MOST OF THIS LIVING AREA 
THAT WINE COLLECTION FOR EXAMPLE MAY WARM YOUR COCKLES 
BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S WHAT THIS FEATURE FIREPLACE WAS INTENDED FOR 
IT'S A GOOD FAMILY KITCHEN BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT'S LAID OUT 
HERE'S FOR COOKING AND THERE'S FOR DINING YOU CAN OPEN THOSE FRENCH DOORS 
ONTO THAT REALLY GORGEOUS GARDEN AND LETTING THE KIDS RUN RIOT 
AND WITH A DECKING AREA JUST OUTSIDE IT WOULDN'T TAKE MUCH 
TO REDEFINE THE GARDEN AS SOMEWHERE TO DINE AL FRESCO 
O. K. ONWARDS AND UPWARDS 
THIS SWISH FAMILY BATHROOM SHOULD HIT ALL THE RIGHT HOT BUTTONS FOR OUR BUYERS 
AND WITH TWO GOOD SIZED KID'S BEDROOMS THIS PLACE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RAISE A FAMILY FORTUNE 
AND THEN THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE THE MASTER BEDROOM 
AND THIS ROOM IS ENORMOUS 
AND WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT A PARK VIEW FROM THE WINDOW 
WHEN YOU'RE PITCHING YOUR HOME AT FAMILIES OUTDOOR SPACE IS A MASSIVE DRAW 
WITH A PARK ON THE DOORSTEP AND ITS OWN GARDEN THIS PLACE GETS A GOLD STAR FOR ITS GREENERY 
LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THIS 
WHAT WE'VE GOT IS A REALLY GOOD SIZED VICTORIAN FAMILY PROPERTY IN A PRIME LOCATION 
AND IT'S IN VERY GOOD DECORATIVE ORDER 
SO I HAVE ONE NIGGLING LITTLE QUESTION NOW WHICH IS WHO'S SELLING IT AND WHY 
THE OWNERS OF THIS HOT PROPERTY ARE DEREK AND FIONA WHITING THEY LIVE HERE WITH DAUGHTERS CHLOE AND ELLA 
IT'S A REALLY FRIENDLY COMMUNITY 
IT FEELS LIKE A LITTLE VILLAGE REALLY A VILLAGE WITHIN A CITY WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE 
ON EVENINGS LIKE THIS WE SOMETIMES TAKE OUR EVENING DINNER OVER TO THE PARK TABLE AND BENCH 
AND END UP WITH OUR NEIGHBOURS AROUND THE TABLE IN THE PARK EATING IT IT'S REALLY NICE 
DEREK AND FIONA BOUGHT THE HOUSE NINE YEARS AGO FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND 
AND THOUGH THEY LOVE THE AREA 
THEY FEEL NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME TO MOVE ON 
SO DEREK AND FIONA WHAT A SPLENDID HOME YOU'VE GOT WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO ABANDON IT 
IT'LL BE REALLY HARD TO LEAVE WE LOVE THIS HOUSE BUT WE'RE RELOCATING TO LANCASHIRE SO WE HAVE TO SELL 
YOU HAVE TO SELL SO YOU'VE GOT KIND OF A LIFESTYLE DREAM HAVE YOU 
TO KIND OF LEAVE THE COAST DOWN HERE AND HEAD UP NORTH 
WE'VE HAD A GREAT TIME HERE BUT WE CAME TO A POINT IN OUR LIVES 
WHERE WE WANTED TO CHANGE COMPLETELY WE DID 
SO WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR LIFESTYLE THAT YOU WANT TO IMPROVE 
I GUESS GETTING MORE TIME TOGETHER AS A FAMILY WITH THE CHILDREN 
WE BOTH WORK IN REALLY STRESSFUL JOBS THAT END UP WITH US WORKING REALLY LONG HOURS 
AND WE WANT TO RECLAIM BACK A BIT OF OUR LIVES BY JUST GETTING A BIT MORE BALANCE 
O. K. WHAT KIND OF MONEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE YOUR DREAM COME TRUE OF MOVING UP NORTH 
WE'D LIKE TO GET ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE FOR IT 
WHICH WILL ENABLE US NOT ONLY TO BUY A NEW FAMILY HOME IN LANCASHIRE 
BUT TO PUT SOME CAPITAL INTO A NEW BUSINESS 
COS WE'D REALLY LIKE TO BE SELF EMPLOYED AS WELL 
OH O. K. MODERN DAY PIONEERS WE LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT 
SO FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT'S THE DREAM YES YOU'VE THROWN DOWN THE GAUNTLET 
LET ME DO SOME RESEARCH AND I WILL TELL YOU IF IT'S POSSIBLE 
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I'LL SEE YOU LATER 
OKEY DOKEY THE WHITINGS HAVE A GREAT FAMILY PROPERTY IN A DESIRABLE LOCATION 
THEY'RE HOPING TO SELL FOR FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND SO I NEED TO GET THEIR ESTATE AGENT 
ON SIDE STRAIGHT AWAY TO FIND OUT IF HE THINKS THAT'S REALISTIC 
SO SHAUN I'VE HAD A LOOK AT THE WHITING'S FAMILY HOME 
HOW OFTEN DOES THAT KIND OF HOUSE COME ONTO THE MARKET 
ONE OR TWO A YEAR PROBABLY COME ON IN THAT ROAD 
NOW IF THAT'S THE CASE WHAT ABOUT PRICES 
RARE PROPERTIES GENERALLY DO ACHIEVE A LITTLE BIT MORE 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A MARKET FOR THEM 
SO I RECKON A PRICE AROUND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY WOULD BE ACHIEVABLE ON THAT PROPERTY 
O. K. BECAUSE THE WHITINGS HAVE SAID 
THEY WANT AROUND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT'S STILL A LEAP OF FAITH YES 
SO WE'LL STILL HAVE TO WORK HERE YEAH 
AND I THINK THE ONLY WAY WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT FIGURE IS BY YOU AND I WORKING REALLY HARD TOGETHER 
WHEN WE DO THIS OPEN DAY 
I'M NOT WANTING A SMALL CHEESE AND WINE PARTY I'M INTO EVENT 
SO GIVE ME A FIGURE HOW MANY CAN YOU GET THROUGH THAT DOOR 
I RECKON WE COULD GET ABOUT TWENTY THROUGH THE DOOR 
TWENTY DONE DEAL BRILLIANT THANK YOU 
SO THE ESTATE AGENT THINKS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IS A REALISTIC PRICE FOR THE WHITING'S HOME 
THEY'RE HOPING FOR FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
AND I'M DETERMINED TO HELP THEM GET THE BEST POSSIBLE PRICE 
BUT BEFORE I START MARKETING IT IN EARNEST 
I THINK I SHOULD CHECK OUT THE COMPETITION 
WHEN SELLING YOUR HOME YOU SHOULD CHECK WHAT ELSE IS FOR SALE 
TO SEE HOW YOUR PROPERTY COMPARES 
AND WHERE TO POSITION IT ON THE MARKET 
AT THE LOWER END OF THE BRIGHTON PROPERTY LADDER 
THIS MAISONETTE IS AVAILABLE FOR TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
WITH TWO DOUBLE BEDROOMS AND A COMPACT KITCHEN 
IT WILL PROBABLY APPEAL TO FIRST TIME BUYERS OR YOUNG COMMUTERS 
AT NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THIS THREE BEDROOMED PERIOD TOWNHOUSE 
IS A GOOD COMPARISON TO DEREK AND FIONA'S PLACE 
WITH A WEALTH OF PERIOD FEATURES 
IT ALSO HAS A GOOD SIZED LIVING AREA AND A LARGE KITCHEN SLASH DINER 
THERE ARE ALSO THREE WELL PRESENTED DOUBLE BEDROOMS 
AND A FAMILY BATHROOM WITH A MODERN SHOWER 
THE MAIN THING IT HAS OVER THE WHITING'S PLACE HOWEVER 
IS IT'S WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE STATION 
BRIGHTON IS FULL OF LONDON COMMUTERS 
SO THIS IS A BIG SELLING POINT WITH THOSE BUYERS 
TOWARDS THE TOP END OF THE MARKET AT EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND IS THIS FOUR BED HOUSE 
JUST UP THE HILL FROM DEREK AND FIONA'S 
ITS HILL TOP POSITION MAKES FOR SOME INCREDIBLE VIEWS OVER BRIGHTON 
THE SEA MAY BE AWAY IN THE DISTANCE 
BUT WHO CARES WHEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN POOL 
AND WHO NEEDS A PARK WHEN YOU'VE THIS MUCH GREENERY 
INSIDE THE DECOR MAY NOT BE TO EVERYONE'S TASTE 
BUT THE SPACIOUS LIVING AREA SPEAKS FOR ITSELF 
AND TO TOP IT OFF THEY'VE MADE GREAT USE OF THE LOFT 
NOW THERE'S AN IDEA 
SO THERE'S A HIGH STANDARD OF PROPERTY OUT THERE 
BUT WITH A FEW CHANGES TO DEREK AND FIONA'S PLACE 
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET CLOSE TO THEIR DREAM FIGURE OF FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE GRAND 
DEREK AND FIONA WHITING WANT TO SELL THEIR THREE BED HOME 
TO START A NEW LIFE CLOSER TO THEIR FAMILY IN THE NORTH WEST 
THEY'RE HOPING TO GET A SALE PRICE OF FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
IT'S BEING MARKETED AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TO ATTRACT BUYERS 
WE'RE GOING TO SELL IT AT A ONE OFF OPEN DAY 
THE ESTATE AGENT'S JOB IS TO DRUM UP EAGER BUYERS 
AND MINE IS TO STAGE THE HOUSE FOR MAXIMUM APPEAL 
I NEED TO PERSUADE THE WHITINGS TO MAKE SOME CHANGES FIRST 
RIGHT FIONA AND DEREK I HAVE A BATTLE PLAN O. K. 
ALL RIGHT I WANT TO DISCUSS IT WITH YOU 
WE'RE GOING TO GET HOARDS OF HUNGRY HOUSE HUNTERS COMING TO LOOK AT THIS HOUSE 
WE'RE GOING TO GET THEM VERY EXCITED 
WE'RE GOING TO WANT THEM TO BID FOR IT 
WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THIS HOUSE IS PRESENTED TO ITS VERY TOP ABILITY 
THIS ROOM YOU'RE USING IT AS AN OFFICE AND LIBRARY AND YOU'RE USING IT FOR YOUR OWN NEEDS YEAH 
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT RECEPTION ROOM IN THERE 
AND I THINK TRYING TO GET THE TWO ROOMS TO WORK TOGETHER 
YOU'VE GOT THESE LOVELY DOORS BUT IF YOU CAN'T OPEN THEM 
BECAUSE THE SOFA'S THERE 
SO WE MIGHT NEED TO RE PLAN THE SOFAS AND GET THESE DOORS OPEN 
THE SPACE WILL SEEM HUGE SURE 
THEN AS WELL AS PRESENTING TWO INDEPENDENT RECEPTION ROOMS 
WE'RE ALSO SHOWING IT AS ONE GREAT BIG SPACE 
NOW CONTROVERSIALLY EVEN THOUGH I ADORE THIS LOVELY MULBERRY COLOUR 
I THINK WE MIGHT NEED TO DO MAKE THIS ROOM THE SAME AS THAT ONE 
SO IT ALL PULLS TOGETHER 
AGAIN IT MAKES THIS ROOM FEEL BIGGER AND LIGHTER 
SURE AND WHEN I SAY WE I MEAN YOU FAIR ENOUGH FAIR ENOUGH O. K. O. K. 
WHO IS GOOD WITH THE PAINT BRUSH 
DEREK THAT WOULD BE MY ROLE I THINK 
O. K. SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU ALL THAT RESPONSIBILITY 
MEANWHILE I'M GOING TO GO OFF AND GET THE OTHER STUFF SORTED 
SO WE WILL SPEAK SOON 
THE KEY TO GETTING A HOUSE LOOKING ITS BEST ON AN OPEN DAY 
IS THROUGH SMALL CHANGES FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT 
BUT BUYERS WILL ONLY VIEW ONCE 
WE'VE GOT TO PUSH ALL THE RIGHT BUTTONS BUT WITHOUT SPENDING LOTS OF TIME OR MONEY 
DEREK AND FIONA'S GARDEN IS A GREAT SELLING POINT 
AND I WANT OUR BUYERS PICTURING THEMSELVES OUT HERE RELAXING 
AND ENJOYING A DRINK IN THE SUN 
TO ACHIEVE THIS WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A DEFINED ENTERTAINING ZONE ON THE DECKING 
THE KITCHEN IS ALSO GREAT 
BUT IS SHOWING THE WEAR AND TEAR OF FAMILY COOKING 
SO THAT NEEDS ADDRESSING 
THE TRICK WITH THE KIDS' BEDROOMS IS TO SHOW THEM TO BUYERS THE WAY THEY'D LOVE THEIR KIDS TO KEEP THEM 
SO WE'RE GOING TO TIDY AND DRESS WITH SOME NEW SOFT FURNISHINGS 
THE PLACE IS BEING MARKETED AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO ATTRACT BUYERS 
AND I'M AIMING TO ADD FIFTEEN GRAND TO THAT WITH SOME SIMPLE STAGING 
I'M ALSO GETTING DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM ABOVE 
I'M REALLY INTRIGUED BY THESE LOFT HATCHES 
I WONDER HOW MUCH ROOM THERE IS IN THE ATTIC 
ON FURTHER INSPECTION IT TURNS OUT NOT MUCH BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
THIS CLUTTERED LOFT COULD HOLD THE KEY TO ACHIEVING THE WHITING'S DREAM SALE PRICE 
THE MAJORITY OF HOUSES IN FIONA AND DEREK'S STREET HAVE HAD THEIR ATTIC SPACES CONVERTED 
YOU CAN SEE IT UP THERE UP THERE 
AS YOU LOOK AROUND THERE'S ONLY ONE OR TWO THAT HAVEN'T 
ONE OF THEM BEING DEREK AND FIONA'S 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR ME 
COS BUYERS LOVE THE IDEA OF BUYING A PROPERTY 
WHERE THEY CAN STILL DEVELOP SOMETHING 
INCREASING THE VALUE AND THE SPACE 
NOW I'LL HAVE A SNOOP AROUND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD 
AND STEAL SOME IDEAS FOR INSPIRATION 
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO LOOK FAR 
JUST AROUND THE CORNER ONE OF THE WHITING'S NEIGHBOURS SPENT AROUN TWENTY SIX THOUSAND ON THIS GREAT CONVERSION 
A PROPER STAIRCASE IS A MUST 
AND THIS ONE FITS PERFECTLY WITH THE STYLE OF THE HOUSE 
THE LARGE EXTRA BEDROOM HAS A CONTEMPORARY WALK IN EN SUITE SHOWER 
WHICH WOULD BE A HUGE HIT WITH BUYERS 
AND COULD REALLY ADD VALUE TO A PROPERTY 
ALTERNATIVELY A MORE BASIC BEDROOM CONVERSION LIKE THIS ONE WOULD COST AROUND TWENTY ONE THOUSAND 
I'M NOT SUGGESTING WE ACTUALLY CONVERT THE WHITING'S LOFT 
IN TIME FOR THE OPEN DAY 
BUT BY PRESENTING OUR POTENTIAL BUYERS WITH PLANS AND DRAWINGS TO SHOW WHAT COULD BE DONE 
WE CAN SELL THE HOUSE'S POTENTIAL 
SO I'VE ARRANGED FOR A SPECIALIST TO MEASURE UP AND PROVIDE SOME IDEAS 
WE BUILD A LOT OF LOFT CONVERSIONS IN HOUSES ROUND HERE 
WHERE PEOPLE ARE QUITE HAPPY TO STAY IN THE AREA 
THEY LIKE THEIR HOUSE 
PERHAPS THEIR KIDS ARE AT SCHOOLS THAT ARE QUITE GOOD 
BUT THEY NEED MORE SPACE 
AND FOR SORT OF TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THOUSAND THEY CAN GET ANOTHER ROOM IN THEIR HOUSE 
WITHOUT HAVING TO YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT HAVING TO MOVE 
MY RESEARCH TELLS ME THAT AN EXTRA BEDROOM COULD ADD 
UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND TO THE VALUE OF A PROPERTY ON THIS STREET 
THAT WOULD PAY FOR A CONVERSION AND THEN SOME 
SO WITH OUR EXPERT'S PLANS AND DRAWINGS 
I'LL RAM HOME THE UNTAPPED ADVANTAGE IN THE WHITING'S LOFT 
WHILE I'VE BEEN BUSY AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE 
IT'S ALL HANDS TO THE PUMP DOWNSTAIRS 
YOU START AT THE BOTTOM I'LL START AT THE TOP 
WITH THREE DAYS UNTIL OUR OPEN HOUSE THE KIDS HAVE BEEN ROPED IN TO HELP CLEAN THEIR BEDROOMS 
AND DEREK IS HARD AT WORK WITH THE PAINTBRUSH 
AND I'VE GOT ONE MORE TRICK UP MY SLEEVE 
TO HOPEFULLY MAKE THOSE BUYERS BID BIG 
THE WHITING FAMILY HOME IS TRULY IN A DREAMY LOCATION 
WITH SO MANY AMENITIES RIGHT ON THEIR DOORSTEP 
I'M OBLIGED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY POTENTIAL BUYER THAT WALKS THROUGH THAT FRONT DOOR 
IS AWARE HOW GOOD IT IS AROUND HERE 
AND WHAT A FANTASTIC PROPERTY THAT IS 
AND I'M GOING TO DO THAT BY SERVING UP ALL THE RELEVANT INFORMATION 
IN A PROPERTY PROFILE AND HANDING IT OUT TO EVERY BUYER 
YOUR PROPERTY PROFILE NEEDS TO ANSWER EVERY QUESTION 
ABOUT YOUR HOUSE AND LOCALITY BECAUSE WITH AN OPEN HOUSE 
YOU'LL BE INUNDATED WITH BUYERS IN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME 
MAKE SURE YOU INCLUDE PHOTOGRAPHS OF ALL THE ROOMS 
GUARANTEES FOR ANY WORK DONE 
AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE BIDDING PROCESS 
AND DON'T FORGET TO SELL YOUR AREA 
INCLUDE DETAILS OF TRANSPORT LINKS 
SCHOOLS AND EVEN MENUS FROM LOCAL RESTAURANTS 
WHILE THE WHITINGS WORK ON THE PROPERTY PROFILE PACK 
ESTATE AGENT SHAUN IS BUSY ON THE PHONE DRUMMING UP POTENTIAL BUYERS 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE BETWEEN TEN AND FIVE O'CLOCK 
THE WHITING FAMILY ARE HOPING OUR ONE OFF OPEN DAY WILL SELL THEIR HOUSE 
THEY'D LOVE TO GET FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
AND I'M CONVINCED AFTER ALL OUR HARD WORK 
DEREK AND FIONA ARE ON COURSE FOR A TOP SALE 
NOW IN HERE ARE OUR PROPERTY PROFILE PACKS 
AND I HAVE TO SAY THEY ARE LOOKING EXCELLENT 
REALLY GLOSSY AND THEY ARE CRAMMED FULL OF ALL THAT USEFUL INFORMATION 
I WAS TALKING ABOUT ABOUT THE HOUSE SPECIFICATIONS 
ABOUT THE PARK OUTSIDE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN BRIGHTON 
ABOUT THE LOFT CONVERSION KEEP REINFORCING THAT 
WE'VE GOT DRAWINGS OF THE HOUSE 
WHAT COULD BE DONE TO PUT THE ATTIC CONVERSION IN 
WE'VE GOT CATCHMENT AREAS FOR SCHOOLS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY 
ON THE LAST PAGE IS HOW YOU BID ON THIS VERY INTERESTING OPEN DAY 
THIS IS ESSENTIAL READING FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR POTENTIAL HOUSE BUYERS 
AND WE'RE AS READY AS WE'LL EVER BE FOR THOSE BIDS 
BECAUSE I THINK THIS HOUSE IS FINALLY READY FOR ITS OPEN DAY 
OUR BIGGEST CHANGE HAS BEEN IN THE LIVING AREA 
WE'VE OPENED UP THE DOORS TO REALLY SHOW OFF THE SPACE 
AND REPAINTED THE BACK RECEPTION AREA TO TIE THE ROOMS TOGETHER 
WE'VE ALSO SUBTLY REDEFINED ITS USE 
BY REMOVING DEREK'S WINE COLLECTION 
AND REPLACING IT WITH GAMES AND SOFT CUSHIONS 
IT NOW LOOKS LIKE A KID FRIENDLY PLAY AREA 
PERFECT FOR OUR TARGET MARKET FAMILIES 
THE KITCHEN'S OIL SPLASHED PAINTWORK WAS LETTING IT DOWN 
BUT BY CLEVERLY POSITIONING SOME GROWING HERBS OVER THE WORST SPOTS 
WE'VE DISGUISED IT 
AND GIVEN A SENSE OF FRESHNESS TO THE ROOM WITHOUT GOING TO THE TROUBLE OR EXPENSE OF REPAINTING IT 
WE'VE ALSO CREATED A D. V. D. OF LOFT DESIGNS 
WHICH IS CUED UP ON THE LANDING 
READY TO PLAY TO OUR BUYERS 
TO HELP THEM VISUALISE HOW IT ALL COULD LOOK 
AND WITH THE TABLE AND CHAIRS OUTSIDE 
THE GARDEN REALLY SHOWS OFF ITS ENTERTAINING POSSIBILITIES 
SO WE'RE ALL SET FOR OUR OPEN HOUSE AND IF ALL GOES TO PLAN 
WE SHOULD HOPEFULLY GET SOME SERIOUS BIDS IN BY THE END OF THE DAY 
IF WE'VE GOT IT RIGHT 
DEREK AND FIONA WILL GET THE FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND THEY WANT 
SO THE BURNING QUESTION IS IS ANYBODY COMING 
SHAUN THE CLOCK IS TICKING WE ARE NEARLY THERE FOR THE OPEN DAY 
I'M TREMBLING SLIGHTLY HOW ABOUT YOU 
LITTLE BIT NERVOUS DON'T TELL ME THAT 
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE NERVOUS 
ALL THESE PEOPLE COMING ALONG ARE WE GOING TO GET ANY OFFERS 
WELL I HAVE FOOLISHLY PUT ALL MY TRUST AND FAITH IN ONE MAN 
THAT MAN BEING YOU 
AND I WANT YOU TO SAY YES I THINK WE WILL DO YOU THINK SO 
YEAH IT'S A GREAT HOUSE GREAT LOCATION 
I THINK WE'LL GET SOME OFFERS IN 
YOU'VE BEEN GETTING PEOPLE HYPED UP ABOUT THIS 
HAS THERE BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST OR NOT 
WE'VE FOCUSSED ON PEOPLE THAT ARE SERIOUS ABOUT BUYING IN THIS AREA 
AND WE'VE GOT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PEOPLE COMING ALONG TODAY 
YOU ARE A DEMI GOD YOU'RE BRILLIANT I LOVE THAT 
TWENTY TWO POTENTIAL BUYERS FINGERS CROSSED 
SO THIS IS IT EAGER BUYERS ARE WAITING IN THE WINGS 
THE HOUSE IS READY TO TAKE CENTRE STAGE 
AND I'M TALKING LAST MINUTE SELLING STRATEGIES WITH DEREK AND FIONA 
WHAT'S YOUR TACTIC HAVE YOU GOT A GAME PLAN YET 
HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT WE'D BETTER THINK QUICKLY 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT VERY LONG WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS 
YES DON'T BE MODEST 
I KNOW MODESTY'S NORMALLY A LOVELY THING 
BUT I THINK BE SHAMELESS BE ABSOLUTELY SHAMELESS 
O. K. WHAT WOULD BE YOUR FAVOURITE PARTS OF THE HOUSE TO TALK ABOUT 
UM PROBABLY THIS ROOM 
BECAUSE THIS IS THE ROOM THAT WE'VE DONE THE MOST WORK IN SINCE WE MOVED HERE 
YEAH SO IT FEELS THE MOST PERSONAL ROOM THAT WE'VE PUT OUR STAMP ON 
AND THE LOCATION FOR ME 
THE PARK AND THE COMMUNITY AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS RIGHT 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHO TURNS UP 
AND WHAT THEY THINK OF IT 
BUT I'M REALLY WORRIED IN CASE NOBODY WANTS TO BUY IT 
OH OH I'M SURE THEY WILL O. K. THEN ARE YOU READY 
I THINK WE ARE YES LET'S DO IT O. K. 
AND WE'RE OFF 
HELLO OUR ESTATE AGENT SHAUN HAS DONE A GREAT JOB 
BECAUSE THE HOUSE QUICKLY FILLS WITH POTENTIAL BUYERS 
I JUST HOPE THAT THE CHANGES WE'VE DONE DO THEIR JOB 
AS THIS IS OUR BIG CHANCE TO MAKE THAT SALE HELLO COME ON IN 
BUYERS ONLY HAVE A FEW HOURS TO VIEW MAKE UP THEIR MINDS 
AND DELIVER A BID 
ALL OFFERS MUST BE IN BY FIVE P. M. 
THIS IS VERY ENCOURAGING 
WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS FIONA AND DEREK VERY ARTICULATE 
TOP SALES PITCH I'M LOVING THIS 
THANKS TO OUR CONVERSION PLANS AND D. V. D. 
THERE'S A REAL BUZZ ABOUT THE LOFT 
DO YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN GET AN EN SUITE UP THERE YES 
ONE PARTY IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED 
AND GIVES DEREK AND FIONA A REAL GRILLING IN THE KITCHEN 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING HERE ABOUT NINE AND A HALF YEARS 
HAVE YOU GOT SOMEWHERE TO GO TO 
WE'RE RELOCATING UP TO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
AND WE'RE GOING TO GO AND LIVE WITH RELATIVES FOR A WHILE 
SO WE'RE NOT BUYING YET SO WE WON'T BE IN AN ONWARD CHAIN 
FIONA'S DOING A GREAT JOB WITH POTENTIAL BUYERS 
MY SALES TECHNIQUE HOWEVER IS PROVING LESS SUCCESSFUL 
FOR ME ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS IS THE POTENTIAL HERE 
BEGGING SCREAMING TO BE CONVERTED INTO THE ATTIC SPACE 
THEY'VE HAD A QUOTE GIVEN WE'VE SEEN THE QUOTE TWENTY GRAND 
QUITE REASONABLE IT'S NOT BAD IS IT 
THIS OPEN HOUSE IS A FAMILY AFFAIR 
AND OUR PLAN TO FOCUS ON THAT SEEMS TO BE COMING GOOD 
THE ENTIRE WHITING CLAN IS HELPING OUT 
BUT OUR ESTATE AGENT IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN 
SHAUN IS HIDING I WANT TO SEE SHAUN I WANT TO SEE SHAUN 
SHAUN I THOUGHT HE'D BE IN HERE HELPING THE SALES 
WHERE IS HE 
AH NOW THIS IS GOOD HE'S ON THE STREET 
HE'S ON THE STREET WOOING BUYERS 
SO I'LL GIVE HIM ANOTHER TWO MINUTES AND THEN I WILL HARASS HIM 
O. K. THREE OR FOUR MINUTES HAVE GONE 
SHAUN IS STILL OUT THERE WITH THE SAME BUYERS 
SORRY POTENTIAL BUYERS AND 
HE'S HAVING A VERY INTENSE CHAT I'VE BEEN SPOTTED 
LOOK CASUAL LOOK CASUAL 
RIGHT MOVING ON 
COULD SHAUN HAVE FOUND OUR BUYERS 
IT'S INTERESTING HOW THIS IS WORKING OUT 
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP A VERY GOOD BALANCE 
BECAUSE ON THE INSIDE IS A VERY RELAXED ATMOSPHERE 
WELL RELAXING NOW ANYWAY 
KEEPING IT QUITE JOVIAL MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH 
AND YET WHAT'S GOOD IS THAT SHAUN IS OUTSIDE HERE AS THEY'RE COMING OUT 
AND DOING THE HARD SELL 
HOW DID YOU REALLY FEEL ABOUT THAT PROPERTY 
GOOD QUESTION HAS ALL OUR HARD WORK PAID OFF 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TAKE CARE HAVE A GOOD DAY THANKS VERY MUCH 
THANK YOU GOOD BYE THANK YOU THANK YOU 
NO WORRIES THANKS A LOT BYE 
BYE BYE BYE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
MY GOODNESS THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY 
WE LIKED IT 
YEAH I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY NICE 
AND HE LIKED IT BEING OPPOSITE THE PARK YEAH 
AND IT'S A NICE IT'S A NICE ROAD 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AND NICELY PRESENTED 
SO OUR OPEN HOUSE HAS GENERATED PLENTY OF INTEREST 
BUT WILL ANYONE BE MAKING A BID 
I THINK WE WILL PUT IN A BID YES LATER ON 
WE'LL GO AWAY AND TALK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT 
AND THEN I THINK BEFORE THE DEADLINE 
WE WILL PUT A BID IN YEAH O. K. 
COS I'M SELLING AT THE MOMENT AND I HAVEN'T GOT AN OFFER 
I'M NOT IN A GREAT POSITION 
I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE MAKING A BID 
BUT I'M SURE SOMEONE WILL SNAP THIS UP BECAUSE IT'S A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE 
LET'S HOPE HE'S RIGHT AS SO FAR 
ONLY ONE BUYER HAS EXPRESSED SERIOUS INTEREST IN MAKING AN OFFER 
AND THE DOOR HAS CLOSED FOR GOOD ON OUR OPEN HOUSE 
NOW WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF HOURS OF NERVOUS WAITING 
BIDS MUST BE DELIVERED TO THE AGENT BY THE FIVE P. M. DEADLINE 
THE MARKETING PRICE WAS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
AND THE WHITINGS HOPE THE HOUSE LOOKS GOOD ENOUGH 
FOR A BID OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND MORE 
CAN'T BE LONG NOW CAN'T BE LONG 
I'VE ACTUALLY GOT BUTTERFLIES IN MY STOMACH 
SINCE ANY BIDS ARE GOING THROUGH SHAUN THE AGENT 
FIONA AND DEREK WON'T EVEN KNOW IF ANYONE'S MADE AN OFFER 
UNTIL AFTER THE DEADLINE HAS PASSED 
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT'S JUST HAPPENED WHAT 
NO NEWS YET AT ALL 
OH THANKS KRISTIAN THANKS KRISTIAN 
BUT I QUICKLY REGRET THAT LITTLE GAG 
BECAUSE THE LACK OF NEWS IS BECOMING TOO MUCH TO BEAR FOR ALL OF US 
MEANWHILE MERCIFULLY POTENTIAL BUYERS ARE SENDING IN BIDS 
O. K. YEAH THAT LOOKS O. K. 
BUT WILL ANYONE OFFER ANYWHERE NEAR THE WHITING'S DREAM PRICE FOUR SIXTY FIVE K. 
PERSONALLY I DON'T EVEN THINK FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY WILL SECURE IT 
BECAUSE IT'S IMMACULATE 
IT'S THE FIVE P. M. DEADLINE 
TIME TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE MASSIVE GAMBLE FIONA AND DEREK HAVE MADE HAS PAID OFF 
DO YOU THINK HE'S ACTUALLY COMING BACK 
I'M PRAYING IT WORKS OUT
