MANCHESTER ARENA WHERE GREAT 
BRITAIN ARE ON TRACK FOR THE MOST 
SUCCESSFUL WORLD COURSE WORLD 
SHORT COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS THEY 
COULD BE MORE MEDALS TO COME THIS 
EVENING GOOD AFTERNOON TO BE 
SUCCESSFUL AT THIS HIGHEST LEVEL 
YOU HAVE SIMPLY GOT TO HACK IT

BRILLIANT SWIM ABSOLUTELY 
BRILLIANT 
THE WINNER HACKETT OF AUSTRALIA THE GREAT GRANT HACKETT IS GOING TO 
SUCCESSFULLY DEFEND HIS TITLE GOAL 
TO HACKETT WELL HE IS SUPREME 
GOLD 
I HAVE TO SAY YOU LOOK BETTER WITH 
HER 
YOU HAVE BERTIE MEDALS SO FAR HER IN TOTAL HAIR YOU HAVE THIRTY 
MEDALS SO FAR YOU COULD HAVE GONE 
TOP EVER IF YOU HAD SWUM HERE WHY 
AREN'T YOU 
I AM INTRODUCING I AM 
QUALIFYING AND PREPARING FOR THE 
OLYMPICS COMING UP BEING HERE IS 
DISAPPOINTING NOT GETTING ON THE 
BLOCK OPEN WATER SWIMMING IS DIRTY 
ISN'T IT OTHER SWIMMERS MIGHT TRY 
AND PULL YOU DOWN HOW DID YOU 
TRAIN FOR THAT 
I HAD A FAIR BIT OF 
EXPERIENCE GOING OUT IN AUSTRALIA 
I HAVE HAD MY FAIR SHARE OF 
EXPERIENCE IN AUSTRALIA IT MAKES 
FOR AN INTERESTING AND DIFFERENT 
STRATEGY IN THE RACE L. AM LOOKING 
FORWARD TO THE CHALLENGE 
THE POOL 
COMES FIRST AT THE OLYMPICS YOU 
WILL BE SWIMMING AS NORMAL AS WE 
ARE USED TO SEEING YOU WHAT 
EVENTS 
THE FOUR BY TWO HUNDRED METRE EVENTS FREESTYLE RELAY L. ONCE AT A 
CHAMPIONSHIPS RECENTLY BUT WANTED 
TO FOCUS ON MIDDLE DISTANCE EVENTS 
IN THE WATER 
WHERE DO YOU THINK 
OUR CHANCES OF SUCCESS LIE MOSTLY 
THE FOCUS WILL BE ON THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED METRE 
THAT WILL BE A HECK OF CHALLENGE 
THE TEN KILOMETRE OPEN WATER EVENT 
IS FOUR DAYS AFTER THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED SO I 
WILL HAVE CRACK AT THAT AS WELL 
MAYBE IN THE FUTURE YOU COULD PLAY 
WATER POLO 
I DON'T BEEN I WOULD 
LIKE IT THAT MUCH BUT CERTAINLY 
IT IS SOMETHING I LOOK FORWARD TO 
YOU MUST ENJOY TRAINING BECAUSE TO 
DO AS MANY LENSE AS YOU DO YOU 
HAVE GOT TO LIKE IT 
I AM A SUCKER 
FOR PUNISHMENT IF I COULD SWIM FIFTY 
OR ONE HUNDRED METRE FREESTYLE I WOULD DO 
THAT 
MARK FOSTER THE MAN WE WILL THAT SEE TONIGHT THE ONLY REASON HE 
SAYS HE HAS LASTED SO LONG AS HE 
CANNOT PUT IN THE LENGTHS THAT YOU 
DO 
I WILL NOT BE DOING IT WHEN I DO GET THAT MUCH OLDER MARK HAS HAD A 
TRUE TEST OF LONGEVITY 
GRANT WILL 
BE WITH US THROUGHOUT THE EVENING 
ASSESSING THE RACES DO YOU STILL 
ENJOY THE ATMOSPHERE OF LIVE 
COMPETITION EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT IN 
IT 
ABSOLUTELY THE ENTERTAINMENT IT VALUE IS FANTASTIC THE WAY WE ARE 
INTRODUCING IT IS MAKING IT MORE 
SPECTATOR FRIENDLY RATHER THAN JUST 
SEEN STUNNING PERFORMANCES 
DO YOU 
THINK IT IS THAT ELEMENT OF 
SHOWBIZ 
WHY NOT L. THINK EVERY SHOWBIZ INDUSTRY OR EVERY SPORT IS BRINGING 
ENTERTAINMENT VALUE IN TO READ AND 
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PROGRESS IN 
PART OF THE SPORT 
ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT INSPIRES INTEREST IN 
AUSTRALIA IS THE SUCCESS OF YOUR 
AND SWIMMERS 
THE SAME 
THING IS 
TRUE OF GREAT BRITAIN WE ARE 
HAVING A 
GREAT NEED 
SO FAR 
LET US 
SEE WHO WE ARE LOOKING OUT FOR SO 
FAR THE TANK ROLES ON LIAM 
TANCOCK GOES FOR HIS THIRD MEDAL 
THIS TIME IN HIS WORLD RECORD 
BREAKING DISTANCE OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED METRES 
BACKSTROKE TASTES GOOD THAT GOLD 
MARK FOSTER ROLLS BACK THE YEARS 
THE OAP OF THE POOL IS ON COURSE IN 
THE RACE COMING UP 
AND HALSALL IS HAVING A BIRTHDAY 
PARTY SHE IS IN THE ONE HUNDRED METRE 
FREESTYLE RELAY THIS IS HOW IT PANS OUT MARK 
FOSTER IS LINING UP IN A FIFTY METRE 
FLYER FINAL AT FIVE TWENTY FIVE P. M. JUST BEFORE 
WE SWITCH TO B. B. C. INTERACTIVE THAT 
IS WHERE YOU WILL SEE THE WOMEN'S 
TWO HUNDRED METRES INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY THE GREAT BRITAIN SKIRL TEAM HOPES 
TO GO ONE BETTER THEY WERE EDGED 
OUT OF A GOLD MEDAL A FEW NIGHTS 
AGO THE GREAT BRITAIN GIRLS TEAM 
SHARON WE HAVE A GREAT CROWD 
CERTAINLY THE ATMOSPHERE IS 
ELECTRIC WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO 
THE FIRST EVENT THE ONE HUNDRED METRE 
BREASTSTROKE HAYWOOD GOING IN 
THERE WE COULD SEE A WORLD RECORD 
FROM THE AMERICAN KATE HAYWOOD HAS 
ALREADY PICKED UP A GOLD MEDAL 
LIAM TANCOCK THOSE RACES WILL BE 
FURIOUS FURIOUS WE HAVE OUR COMMENTATORS STANDING 
BY IT IS DARK TONIGHT CAN YOU 
SEE 
HOW IS THAT IS THAT BETTER SEE THE SHINE IS COMING OFF MY HEAD WE WE WILL POLISH IT 
MARK FOSTER HAS TO 
BE ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS TONIGHT 
WHETHER OR NOT HE WINS A MEDAL IT 
IS GREAT FOR HIM TO THE AND A FINAL 
TO BE IN A FINAL 
I THINK HE CAN WIN THE FIFTY METRE 
BUTTERFLY IT DEPENDS WHETHER HE 
CAN STAND UP TO THE COMPETITION 
THE SEMI FINAL WENT FIVE HUNDRED WE WILL 
WAIT AND SEE MARK IS THE PEOPLE'S 
CHAMPION EVERYBODY SEEMS TO LOVE 
HIM AND TO PERFORM AT THIS LEVEL 
AND SWIM ABOUT FAST AT THE AGE OF 
THIRTY SEVEN IS INCREDIBLE 
THAT WOULD BE TEN 
YEARS AWAY FROM YOU YOU ARE TWENTY SEVEN 
YES TURNING TWENTY EIGHT NEXT MONTH L. AM 
STARTING TO FEEL PRETTY OLD HE HAS 
THE GREY HAIRS TO SHOW FOR IT HE 
GOT BEATEN BY A WORLD RECORD LAST 
NIGHT WHICH WAS AN INCREDIBLE 
WORLD RECORD A VERY QUICK SWIM L. 
THINK THE FIFTY METRES TONIGHT HE 
WILL BE FEELING CONFIDENT AND WELL 
PUT A GOOD RACE TOGETHER THE THE CLAPPING BEHIND US IS GETTING 
FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER THE 
FIRST FINAL IS APPROACHING LET US 
GET THE START LIST THE FIRST RACE IS THE WOMEN'S ONE HUNDRED 
METRE BREASTSTROKE WE HAVE THE TWO 
FASTEST WOMEN IN THIS EVENT EVER 
JESSICA HARDY IN FOURTH POSITION AND 
IN SIXTH POSITION JAKE EDMISTONE 
THE AUSTRALIAN WHO HAD HER WORLD 
RECORD BROKEN IN THAT FIFTY AN 
OUTSIDE LANE FOR HAYWARD 
I THINK 
SHE HAS A GOOD POSITION A NUMBER 
OF SWIMMERS SAY THE OUTSIDE LANE IS 
A LITTLE BIT LESS CHOPPY IN THIS 
POOL IN SOME WAYS L. DON'T KNOW 
I THINK IT WILL BE GOOD ANYWAY 
INTERESTINGLY MARK FOSTER SAID IT 
WAS PARTICULARLY WAVEY IN THE 
MIDDLE AND HE WANTED AN OUTSIDE 
LANE 
HERE IS KATE HAYWOOD THE LANE FIRST BRITISH SWIMMER AND A SIXTY SIX 
SECONDS QUALIFYING IN LANE ONE 
LOOKING RELAXED SHE HAS HAD A VERY 
GOOD TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING THE 
BRITISH TRIALS 
THE OVATION THERE 
FROM THE CROWD WAS ENORMOUS THE 
BIGGEST CROWD WE HAVE HAD SO FAR IN 
THIS CHAMPIONSHIP THERE IS STILL 
ONE MORE DAY TO GO THERE IS AN A 
FEW SEATS LEFT THERE ARE JUST A 
FEW SEATS LEFT 
SHE WAS 
DISQUALIFIED AT THE END OF THE RACE 
HAVING TUMBLED A LITTLE BIT 
TWITCHED A LITTLE BIT ON THE BLOCK 
SO THE WORLD CHAMPION ON A FIFTY 
METRE BREASTSTROKE LONG COURSE 
FROM TWO THOUSAND FIVE EDMISTONE KATSOULIS GOT 
A SILVER MEDAL EQUAL WITH KATE 
HAYWOOD SHE IS IN THE DEAD LANE 
BILJON FROM SOUTH AFRICA SHE WON 
A MEDAL TWO YEARS AGO SHE WON 
SILVER CAN SHE IMPROVED TO GOLD 
SHE IS IN THE THIRD LANE JESSICA 
HARDY IS SPRINTING SO WELL 
SHE IS 
DOING SOME GREAT STROKE TECHNIQUE 
WORK HER TIMING IS ALMOST PERFECT 
SHE LOOKS QUITE SLOW WHEN SHE 
TAKES OFF HER TOP SHE LOOKS QUITE 
SLIGHT BUT SHE IS NOT 
SHE IS 
CHARMING SHE IS ALMOST THE SAME 
SIZE AS YOU AND I 
WELL SHE IS 
STRONG THAT IS FOR CERTAIN THE 
FASTEST WOMAN IN HISTORY ON THE 
BREASTSTROKE GREAT BRITAIN RIGHT 
AT THE TOP THERE CAN WE SEE PAST 
HARDIE ADRIAN 
NOT REALLY L. THINK 
EFIMOVA HAS A GREAT TECHNIQUE 
BILJON IS STRONG L. THINK EDMISTONE 
MAY BE A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR 
HAYWARD IN LANE ONE FOR GREAT 
BRITAIN EFIMOVA IN LANE TWO KATSOULIS 
OF AUSTRALIA THREE HARDIE OF AUSTRALIA FOUR CHINA IS RIGHT AT 
THE BOTTOM 
WELL HARDY A 
FANTASTIC REACTION TO THE GUN 
ALMOST OH ONE OF A SECOND FASTER THAN 
ANYBODY ELSE THAT WAS JUST A 
REACTION TO THE GUN EDMISTONE AS 
WE EXPECT THE FORMER WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER OUT AHEAD L. THINK SHE WILL 
GO THE NEXT TWO LENSE WAY UNDER THE 
WORLD RECORD 
JONES IS A TWO HUNDRED METRES 
SPECIALIST HE HOLDS SHE HOLDS 
THE RECORD THE WHEELS DO COME OFF 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
WHETHER SHE CAN HANG ON THOUGH 
JESSICA HARDY IS INSIDE HIS LAST TWENTY FIVE 
METRES EDMISTONE IS COMING BACK 
THOUGH THAT YELLOW HAT IS COMING 
BACK IN SIX SHE IS A SPRINTER IT 
LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE HARDY IN THE 
CENTRE THE WORLD CHAMPION IS GOING 
TO BE JESSICA HARDY HAS THE WORLD 
RECORD GONE KNOW THE GOLD MEDAL 
TO HARDY THE SILVER TO EDMISTONE 
OF AUSTRALIA THE SOUTH AFRICAN 
DEBTS THE BRONZE AND GREAT 
BRITAIN'S KATE HAYWOOD IN ONE SHE 
ENDED UP FINISHING IN SEVENTH POSITION 
THE SOUTH AFRICAN DEBTS THE 
BRONZE 
SHE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO BRONZE HOLD ON GET THE BRONZE SHE DID 
NOT HAVE ENOUGH ON THAT LAST LENT 
TO BREAK THE RECORD IT IS A GOOD 
SIGN THOUGH THIS TIME OF THE YEAR 
I THINK THE RACE BETWEEN HER AND 
JONES WILL BE FANTASTIC AT THE 
OLYMPICS THIS TIME OF YEAR SHE 
IS GIVING IT EVERYTHING SHE HAS 
TAKEN A YEAR OF COLLEGE 
SPECIFICALLY TO FOCUS ON THIS AND 
OF COURSE TRAINING SHE DOES NOT 
LOOK THAT PLEASE ACTUALLY 
NO BUT 
SHE IS THREE TENTHS OF A SECOND 
OUTSIDE THE WORLD RECORD THAT IS 
NOT BAD 
NO BUT SHE WANTS TO MAKE 
A MARK BEFORE THE OLYMPICS SHE 
WANTS TO BUILD CONFIDENCE AND PLANT 
A SEED OF DOUBT IN JONES WELL WELL JONES DID CRACK A LITTLE BIT IT 
HAS HAPPENED BEFORE L. WONDER HOW 
SHE HAS GONE NOW MENTALLY 
I THINK 
WE HAVE SEEN A DIFFERENT CHARACTER 
SHE IS A LOT STRONGER MENTALLY 
JONES WILL BE RACING THIS WOMAN 
HARDY THAT IS GOING TO BE A GREAT 
OLYMPIC FINAL 
YOU THINK THE TANK HAS GOT TO THE 
BOTTOM 
YES I THINK IT IS EMPTY BOTTOM THIS MORNING I WAS SO TIRED L. DID 
NOT GO TO BED UNTIL TWELVE FORTY P. M. L. JUST 
HAD TO GET UP AND GO FOR A SWIM AND 
I KNEW THAT IT WAS PRETTY MUCH ON 
THE RED MARKER 
HE HAD SUCH A BUSY 
TIME HERE THE EUROPEAN 
CHAMPIONSHIPS THE TRIALS AND YOU 
HAVE COME HERE AND YOU HAVE TAKEN 
THE ELECTRICITY AFTER CROWD WELL 
DONE YOU HAVE HAD SUCH A BUSY 
TIME YOU MUST BE PLEASED 
YES I 
AM CHUFFED TO BITS LAST WEEK WAS 
AMAZING MAKING THE TEAM AND 
GETTING BACK THE BRITISH RECORD 
TONIGHT THIS WAS JUST A RACE THAT 
DID NOT HAPPEN BUT I AM REALLY 
HAPPY WITH HOW IT HAS GONE 
BACK ON 
THE THE HARD WORK 
I HAVE FINISHED 
RACING NOW SO NOW MAYBE I WILL 
HAVE A BIT OF REST AND RECOVERY 
SHE OUTING FOR EVERYONE ELSE YES YES I WAS SUPPORT EVERYBODY ELSE IT 
WILL BE THE FIRST TIME I CAN SIT 
AND WATCH 
WE HAVE JESSICA HERE

COMPETITIVE FIELD AND I WAS HAPPY

SQUEEZED THAT WORLD RECORD

SPORT IS AWESOME OUT HERE L. LOVE IT 
HAVE YOU FINISHED COMPETING NO IT NO I HAVE TWO MORE EVENTS 
WE WILL SEE 
YOU LATER ON THANK YOU WELL IT WASN'T A BAD SWIM ANDY I 
THINK SHE WAS A LITTLE BIT 
DISAPPOINTED IT IS GOOD TO SEE 
WHEN SOMEBODY OF THAT QUALITY WANTS 
TO GO EVEN BETTER WHEN THEY ARE 
THAT CLOSE TO THE WORLD RECORD 
LIAM TANCOCK FASTEST QUALIFIER 
THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY 
INTERESTING TANCOCK IN FOUR THE 
WORLD RECORD HOLDER IN SIX 
RUPPRATH OF GERMANY WELL HE CAME 
IN FAIRLY LATE TO THIS NEED L. CAN 
TELL YOU IN THIS RACE WE HAVE THE 
WORLD CHAMPION FROM TWO THOUSAND AND ONE IN 
LANE THREE BUT THEN WE HAVE THE 
WORLD RECORD HOLDER LONG COURSE 
THAT IS TANCOCK THE WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER SHORT COURSE RUPPRATH AND 
THE WORLD CHAMPION WHO COMES FROM 
SOUTH AFRICA AT IN THE WORLD 
RECORD WILL GO HERE BUT WHO WILL 
IT GO TO I THINK THE WORLD 
RECORD WILL GO 
I THINK TANCOCK HAS 
BUILT THIS UP SIGNIFICANTLY HE IS 
BUILDING HIS CONFIDENCE RUPPRATH 
LOOKED A LITTLE BIT RUSTY HE FLEW 
IN THE DAY BEFORE THE HEATS THIS 
IS THE ONLY EVENT HE IS SWIMMING 
BUT HE ALWAYS PULLS THINGS OUT OF 
THE BACK HE IS BRILLIANT ON THE 
SHORT COURSE HE NEVER QUITE DOES 
IT ANYWHERE ELSE HERE HE IS THE 
GREAT RUPPRATH HE IS NOT THE 
TALLEST CHAP IN THE WORLD BUT THE 
ATTACK THAT HE GIVES IT HE 
ACTUALLY ATTACKS IT QUITE SIMILARLY 
TO LIAM TANCOCK 
ABSOLUTELY L. 
THINK A NUMBER OF PEOPLE RANDALL 
BAL HE GOES OUT VERY QUICKLY AS 
WELL TANCOCK IS VERY QUICK WHEN 
THEY COME OFF THE WALL OF THE START 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE USING THE 
WHOLE FIFTEEN METRES UNDERWATER POPPING 
UP AND RANDALL BAL I IMAGINE 
TANCOCK RUPPRATH THOSE THREE 
PARTICULARLY WILL BE AT LEAST HALF 
A METRE AHEAD WE WILL LISTEN TO 
THE OVATION FOR LIAM TANCOCK L. LOVE THIS AND IT IS A GREAT VENUE FOR 
SWIMMING LIAM TANCOCK IS THE NEW 
WORLD RECORD HOLDER FOR THE LONG 
COURSE BACKSTROKE HE HAD A 
BRILLIANT TWO HUNDRED MEDLEY WE KNOW HE IS 
SOME REALLY GOOD FORM THE GUY THAT 
IS GOING TO WIN TODAY IS THE GUY 
WHO MAKES NO MISTAKES AT ALL WE WE ARE GOING TO SEE A BLANKET FINISH THERE IS TANCOCK THE FINAL OF THE MEN'S FIFTY METRES 
BACKSTROKE LIAM TANCOCK AT THE 
CENTRE WITH THE BLUE HAT A NICE 
CLEAN START TANCOCK GOT A VERY 
GOOD START INDEED HE IS UP AGAINST 
THE BEST STARTERS AND TURNERS HE 
IS VERY GOOD UNDER WATER A BETTER 
TEAM BY PETER MARSHALL TANCOCK IN 
FOUR MARSHALL HAS GOT THE FINISH 
MARSHALL HAS GOT THE GOLD TANCOCK 
GETS HIS SILVER DELANEY OF 
AUSTRALIA GOT THE BRONZE THANK THANK GOODNESS FOR ELECTRONIC TIMING ALL 
OF THEM WENT IN AT ONCE ALL IN THE 
CENTRE LANES MARSHALL JUST MANAGED 
TO TAKE IT L. CANNOT SEE ANYTHING 
GO WRONG LOOK AT THIS IT WAS A 
CASE OF WHEN THE ARM WENT OVER 
ACTUALLY I DID NOT SEE MARSHALL GOT IT RIGHT I DON'T 
THINK TANCOCK CAN BE THAT 
DISAPPOINTED 
AGAIN ON THE SHORT DISAPPOINTED COURSE YOU'VE GOT TO PRACTISE YOUR 
TURN TANCOCK WENT IN FIRST AND 
CAME OUT SLIGHTLY BEHIND PETER 
MARSHALL I THINK THAT WAS IT 
MARSHALL WINNING THE GOLD MEDAL IN 
THE FIFTY BACK QUITE QUICK TANCOCK 
GOT THE SILVER DELANEY GOT THE 
BRONZE 
WHAT A RECEPTION 
IT'S BRILLIANT 
HERE TONIGHT IT IS PACKED AND THE 
CROWD ARE GOING WILD FANTASTIC TO 
BE A PART OF IT

CLOSE THE GUY IS ABNORMALLY GOOD 
AT SPOTTING RACES BUT WE COULD NOT 
TELL 
HE CANNOT ON A FIFTY IT IS ALL TELL ABOUT 
THE SKILLS L. DID NOT SWIM THE PERFECT RACE TODAY BUT I'M 
PRETTY PLEASED TO COME AWAY WITH A 
SILVER MEDAL FANTASTIC 
THE CROWD 
ARE LOVING YOU HE GOT ANOTHER ONE 
THERE TO COME SO I'LL LET YOU GO 
IT'S THE ONE HUNDRED MEDLEY LATER THAN 
LOOKING FORWARD THAT CHEERS THE START 
WAS GOOD THE FIRST TWENTY FIVE WAS EXCELLENT YOU CANNOT MAKE ANY 
MISTAKES ON THE FIFTY BACKSTROKE 
I AM 
NOT SURE I CAN PICK ANYTHING OUT 
HE WAS THE FIRST DOVER HE IS UNDER 
WATER NOW MARSHAL COMES UP A 
LITTLE BIT LATER ALMOST ON THE FIFTY 
METRE MARK THE FINISH IS A BLANKET 
FINISH 
PETER CONGRATULATIONS WE WERE

YOU WERE PRETTY QUICK THANKS THANKS THANK YOU THE FIRST SEMI FINAL OF THE WOMEN'S 
FIFTY METRES BACK LIZZIE SIMMONDS 
GOES IN LAME TWO SHE BROKE THE 
BRITISH RECORD TO QUALIFY FOR THIS 
SEMI FINAL THERE SHE IS I WAS TALKING TO HER 
COACH AND HE SAID SHE DID A 
NEGATIVE A SPLIT WHICH MEANS SHE 
CAME BACK FASTER THAN SHE WENT OUT 
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT BEFORE 
SHE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO THAT 
IF SHE GETS A GOOD START IT WILL 
BE GOOD TO SEE LIZZIE SIMMONDS 
GOING ON FIRST TWENTY FIVE THE SECOND SEMI FINALS MUCH QUICKER 
I MUST SAY THAT INCLUDES KIRSTY 
COVENTRY THIS SEMI FINAL IS ABOUT 
TIMES IT IS NOT ABOUT PLACES WHAT 
A GREAT TWO HUNDRED BACKSTROKE LIZZIE

WORLD RECORD TAKE YOUR MARKS THE FIRST SEMI FINAL OF THE WOMEN'S

SHE NOT BEING

TABLE ON HER OWN AT THE MOMENT THE 
THREE GOALS TO HER NAME SHE HAS 
SET TWO WORLD RECORDS DID NOT HAVE 
A FIRST A GOOD FIRST TWENTY FIVE COVENTRY COVENTRY IS PRETTY SLOW STILL BEHIND THE 
PACE JUST OUTSIDE THE WORLD RECORD THAT 
IS A VERY GOOD SEMI FINAL SWIM FROM 
THE WINNER IT IS A NEW 
CHAMPIONSHIP RECORD FOR HER I I THINK COVENTRY ENDED UP GETTING A 
SECOND IF YOU ARE NOT IN THAT WILL SPRING 
TO THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS TO 
HANG ON THAT WILL SPRINTER HOW FAR AHEAD WAS SHE AT TWENTY FIVE AND 
THIS TURNER SHE USED ALL FIFTEEN OR 
WHICH IS UNUSUAL GREAT BRITAIN'S LIZZIE SIMMONDS 
THEREFORE WILL MAKE THE FINAL SHE 
WILL BE IN LANE EIGHT WHICH IS NOT 
BAD SHE HAS GOT SOME REALLY QUICK 
SUM AS A FRONT OF THEIR INCLUDING 
THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER 
WE'VE SEEN THE LIAM TANCOCK WINNER 
FROM LANE EIGHT ALREADY THIS SOME 
PIGEONS WATCHING THE ENTIRE COX 
FINAL HOW MUCH OF THE LIFT DOES IT 
GIVE THE HOME FANS 
YOU COULD HEAR 
THE CROWD IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE L. 
THINK AS MARSHALL SAID YOU CAN 
FEEL THE ENERGY DOESN'T BUT A WAY 
YOU ARE FROM YOU CAN FEEL THE 
ENERGY AND IT IS A GREAT CRED IT 
WAS AN ELECTRIC RACE I WAS WRITING 
THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT YOU YOU MUST BE PLEASED GIVING YOU RACE 
OVER LONGER DISTANCES BUT ONE NOT 
HAVE ALSO RELY ON FINGER SHOULD 
ON FINGERTIP FINISHERS THE THE TECHNICAL ASPECT IS EVERYTHING 
LIAM CAME UP A LITTLE BIT TOO EARLY 
ON THE SECOND TWENTY FIVE AND HE 
LOST TO MARSHAL WHEN HE GOT THE 
EXTRA HALF METRE LIAM OUT SWUM HIM 
UP AT MARSHALLS SKILLS COST THEM AT 
THE END 
IN SOME SPORTS 
COMPETITORS ARE RESIDENT ON BEING 
HARD AND OTHER COMPETITORS IN THAT 
SWIMMING YOU ARE TOUGH ON THE 
YOURSELF AND EACH OTHER 
I THINK 
SALAZAR EXTREMELY ANALYTICAL YOU 
THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU DO 
THERE ARE SO MANY ASPECTS TO IT 
TECHNICALLY THEY ARE NOT BUILT TO 
SWIM IN WATER WE ARE BUILT TO RUN 
AND FORK HE ALSO CRITICAL OF 
YOURSELF AND YOUR OWN PERFORMANCE 
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE 
GOING TO FIX 
MORE CONVERSATION TO COME BUT 
THERE IS A MEDAL CEREMONY GOING ON 
BEHIND ME FOR THE WOMEN'S ONE HUNDRED METRE 
BREASTSTROKE BREASTSTROKE WELL IT WAS SILVER MEDAL TO 
YEARS AGO NOW SHE GETS THE GOLD 
JADE AND EDMISTONE DES THE SILVER 
JAYDE EDMISTONE GETS THE SILVER 
SHE STILL IS THE SECOND FASTEST 
BREASTSTROKE SWIMMER IN HISTORY FOR 
WOMEN THE FIFTY METRE BREASTSTROKE IS 
UNBELIEVABLE SO A VERY GOOD ONE HUNDRED 
METRE HERE JESSICA HARDY A WORLD 
RECORD ON FIFTY METRE BREASTSTROKE 
THIS TIME IT'S JUST GOLD MEDAL 
THREE TENTHS OF A SECOND OUTSIDE 
HER WORLD RECORD WHICH IS HELD BY 
JONES OF AUSTRALIA OUTSIDE THE 
WORLD RECORD IT IS GOING TO BE 
VERY INTERESTING IN BEIJING TO SEE 
THAT RACE 
IN HIS ONE I AM 
CERTAINLY LOOKING FORWARD TO AND 
THE IT IS GOOD TO SEE AMERICANS 
AND AUSTRALIANS BATTLING IT OUT ON 
ANY RACE BUT ESPECIALLY ON THE 
BREASTSTROKE 
WERE CHAMPION JUST BREASTSTROKE HARDY OF THE U. S. A. WORLD CHAMPION 
JESSICA HARDY JESSICA HARDY ADDING THAT GOAL TO 
THE GOAL THAT SHE WON ON THE FIFTY 
THAT COLD TO THE GOLD BUT SHE WON 
ON THE FIFTY NOT A BAD CHAMPIONSHIP 
FOR HER THREE GOLD MEDALS AND I 
FULLY EXPECT HER TO BE GOING FOR 
THE GOLD MEDAL IN BEIJING IN A FEW 
MONTHS' TIME 
CRIED AND I JUST STOOD FOR THE 
ANTHEM YOU COULD NOT REALLY STAND 
YOU NEARLY HIT YOUR HEAD ON THE 
CONCRETE HOW TALL ARE YOU 
SIX F. T. SIX 
EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS 
WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT ANALYSING YOUR 
SWIMMING EARLIER CAN YOU TRANSLATE 
THAT TO OTHER AREAS OF LIFE 
BUSINESS AND OTHER AREAS OF LIFE IN 
GENERAL 
THE SKILLS ARE ONES THAT GENERAL APPLIED TO LOTS OF AREAS I DO LOTS 
OF TRAINING THIS THE ATTACK THE 
TIME MANAGEMENT THE DISCIPLINE 
THE SACRIFICE WORKING TOGETHER AS 
A TEAM THOSE SORT OF SKILLS YOU 
CAN TRANSFER INTO MANY OTHER AREAS 
OF YOUR LIFE 
HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN 
YOUR CONCENTRATION L. WOULD GET 
BORED TO DEATH HAVE YOU GOT AN M. P. 
THREE PLAYER 
THE THERE ARE THINGS 
OUT THERE LIKE THAT NOW THERE 
ARE THINGS OUT THERE LIKE THAT 
THERE ARE A 
LOT OF 
THINGS YOU 
ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT SOMETIMES 
THE PARK 
YOU 
GET A 
LITTLE BIT 
OF TIME TO 
YOURSELF IT IS 
QUITE THERAPEUTIC 
THE 
DISCIPLINE IS 
SOMETHING YOU 
HAVE 
TO WORK 
ON EVERY DAY 
COMPETING 
AT THIS 
LEVEL IN FRONT OF 
THOSE CROWDS A COMBINATION OF 
FACTORS CERTAINLY 
IF YOU HOLD IN YOUR MOMENT ONE 
RACE ONE VICTORY THAT YOU HOLD IN 
YOUR MIND WHAT IS IT IF YOU 
HOLD IN YOUR MEMORY ONE RACE IT IT IS THE OLYMPIC GAMES THINGS CAN GO 
WRONG ONCE EVERY FOUR YEARS THEY 
ARE YEARS IN BETWEEN TO FOCUS ON 
THAT GREAT OPPORTUNITY THERE ARE 
YEARS THE ULTIMATE IS TO STAND ON 
THE PODIUM AT THE OLYMPICS AND HEAR 
YOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM 
LET US TAKE CHECK ON THE NEXT RACE COMING UP HERE IS ANDY NOTHING WE HAVE A FAIRLY CHEESED 
OFF MAGNINI FROM ITALY HERE HIS 
NOSE IS SLIGHTLY OUT OF JOINT SO 
FAR AT THIS MEET 
HE HAS NOT HAD 
THE SUCCESS HE WOULD LIKE YES 
THE ITALIANS HAVE NOT BROUGHT THE 
SIZE OF TEAM THAT THEY WOULD HAVE 
LIKED 
A FANTASTIC OLD INNER LIKED FREESTYLE SILVA HE WILL BE WITH 
HIS TEAM MATE IN A MOMENT A 
FANTASTIC FREESTYLER 
MONK WON IT 
FROM LANE SEVEN HE IS IN LANE SEVEN 
AGAIN HE MISSED THE SEMI FINAL 
THOUGH KATE PALMER IN LANE SIX HE 
GOT THE TWO HUNDRED METRES IN THE THREE 
STAR FROM LANE EIGHT YOU HAVE TO 
BE AWARE OF THE AUSTRALIANS HERE HERE HE IS 
THE ITALIAN HE IS A GREAT 
SPRINTER I HAVE TO SAY I AM 
SLIGHTLY JEALOUS BECAUSE HE IS A 
BIG CHAP AND VERY VERY FAST 
ZASTROW OF HOLLAND IN FIVE MEOLANS 
IN LANE FOUR FROM ARGENTINA VERY 
QUICK INDEED HE WILL BE QUICK TO 
FIFTY I JUST WONDER WHETHER HE WILL 
BE ABLE TO HOLD ON 
HE LOOKED 
IMPRESSIVE THIS MORNING HELD ON 
VERY WELL ONLY TWO OF THEM WENT 
UNDER FORTY EIGHT SECONDS MAGNINI GRABBED 
THE EUROPEAN LONG COURSE 
CHAMPIONSHIP A FEW WEEKS AGO ONLY 
GOT THE BRONZE IN THE THREE STAR 
AND LOST THE 
WORLD RECORD THAT THAT WORLD RECORD WAS JUST STUNNING IN THE FREESTYLE I THINK THE ONES TO WATCH WILL BE 
MAGNINI IN THREE AND MEOLANS IN 
FOUR AND NEVER RULE OUT THE 
AUSTRALIANS WHEN THEY ARE ON THE 
OUTSIDE SO FOUR LENSE FREESTYLE SOME QUICK 
BOYS IN THE MIDDLE FOUR LENGTHS 
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY SWIM IT 
DO THEY GO BLASTING FROM THE START 
OR DO THEY TRY TO CONTROL IT IN IN TRUSTINGLY ZASTROW OF HOLLAND 
LOOK AT HIS STROKE HE HAS QUITE 
SKINNY ARMS NOT AS BIG AS CASTRO 
NOT AS BIG AS MEOLANS 
MAYBE THE 
NICE LONG STROKE WILL HELP AND A 
DECENT TURNOVER LOOK AT THAT A 
VERY QUICK SEMI FINAL COMING UP 
THESE GUYS NEED TO GET IN QUICK AND 
WELL LOOK AT MAGNINI ALSO KEBBAB 
OF ALGERIA HE GOT A VERY QUICK 
TIME AS WELL WHEN EVERYBODY IS 
MUCKING ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE THAT 
IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN THE OUTSIDE 
LANES ARE VERY VERY GOOD WE HAVE 
SEEN GOLD MEDALS COME FROM OUTSIDE 
WE SAW LIAM TANCOCK DO IT ON THE 
BACKSTROKE HE IS ONE OF THREE 
SWIMMERS WHO GOT THE SAME TIME THIS 
MORNING HE WON THIS REMARK THAT 
HAPPENED THIS MORNING A MAJOR 
SEMI FINAL AND NOW HE WON THIS 
MORNING TWO PEOPLE GOT A LITTLE 
BIT CAUGHT UP AND WONDERED WHO WAS 
WHERE WHILE THAT WAS HAPPENING 
KEBBAB OF ALGERIA OR A GREAT SWIM 
FOR HIM FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX MAGNINI ALSO SWAM 
WELL OF ALGERIA HIS EYES JUST 
UNDER THE WATER LEVEL BUT LOOKING 
FORWARD HE IS A LUCKY MAN A SWIM 
OFF TO MAKE THAT SEMI FINAL NEARLY 
MISSED IT AND NOW HE IS IN THE 
SEMI FINAL SO THE SECOND SEMI FINAL HOCKIN 
SLUM REALLY WELL IN THE HEATS BUT 
ADRIAN IN FOR WILL POSE A THREAT 
DUJE DRAGANJA OR THE WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER HE IS UP IN FOUR DUJE 
DRAGANJA THE ALGERIAN HAS JUST 
SEEN HIS TEAM MATE KEBBAB WIN 
THAT SEMI FINAL 
HE HAS NOT SLOW 
HIMSELF HE HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE 
MEDALS IN THE BIG HEATS HE BEAT 
THE HOME FAVOURITE LAST NIGHT 
EVERYONE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE 
HIM GET HIS FIFTH GOLD MEDAL IN THE 
THREE STAR BUT HE DID NOT DO IT 
DUJE DRAGANJA HAD TO GET A WORLD 
RECORD TO BEAT HIM 
AGUILERA OF 
ARGENTINA THEN RIGHT NEXT TO THE 
WORLD RECORD HOLDER ON THE FIFTY M. 
FREESTYLE DUJE DRAGANJA JASON 
DUNFORD JUST SAW HIS BROTHER IN 
THE FIRST SEMI HIS BROTHER DAVID 
DIDN'T ACTUALLY SWIM BACK WELL 
THIS IS FOR YOU AND THE THAT IS 
WHAT MAGNINI NORMALLY DOES LIKE 
TO SEE THAT LITTLE BIT THE SOUTH 
AFRICANS DO HAVE A BIT OF AN 
ATTITUDE BUT I REALLY LOVE SEEING 
THEM DOING IT NOW BENJAMIN HOCKIN 
WELL A GREAT OVATION THIS IS THE 
BIG TIME FOR HOCKIN HE HAS NOT 
BEEN IN THIS POSITION BEFORE IT 
WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE 
DEALS 
WITH THE 
PRESSURE BECAUSE 
THIS GUY ADRIAN SWAM REALLY 
QUICKLY ALMOST A SECOND FASTER 
THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEAT 
HOPEFULLY HE WILL DRAG HOCKIN 
THROUGH 
ABSOLUTELY HE SWAM FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THROUGH IN THE HEATS L. THINK IT WILL BE 
GOOD FOR HOCKIN TO BE NEXT TO HIM 
THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHTS IN THE SEMIS L. 
WOULD LOVE TO SEE HOCKIN BEAT ONE 
OF THEM IN THE SECOND SEMI TO 
FORTY EIGHTS TWO FORTY EIGHTS IT TO THE WORLD RECORD TO 
BEAT MARK FOSTER HONOUR FREESTYLE 
IT TOOK THE WORLD RECORD TO BEAT 
MARK FOSTER FREESTYLE THERE ARE SOME QUICK GUYS HERE I 
THINK THEY WILL SWIM FAST AND THEN 
SLOWED DOWN RATHER THAN BUILT INTO 
THIS ONE SO THE SECOND SEMI FINAL 
OF THE ONE HUNDRED METRE FREESTYLE DUJE 
DRAGANJA THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER 
AT THE TOP AS WE EXPECTED GOING 
OUT VERY QUICKLY 
ABSOLUTELY A 
NUMBER OF THESE GUYS DO THE FIFTY AS 
WELL BUT DUJE DRAGANJA MAKES IT 
HIS EVENT AS WELL HOCKIN DOING 
WELL HE IS THERE OR THEREABOUTS L. 
THINK DUJE DRAGANJA IS HOLDING 
SOMETHING BACK HERE LOOKING ACROSS 
THE POOL AT EACH OTHER ONE AND 
EIGHT THEY ARE THE TWO LEADERS 
PARKIN HAS SOME WORK TO DO HE IS 
ABOUT EIGHT AT THE MOMENT DUJE 
DRAGANJA SELLING WELL SWIMMING 
PART POWERFULLY HARKIN SO 
DUJE DRAGANJA WINS IT FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIX GREAT 
BRITAIN'S THEN HOCKIN ENDED UP 
FORTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT FOUR I THINK IT WAS 
UNFORTUNATELY HE IS NOT GOING TO 
MAKE THE FINAL DUJE DRAGANJA MUCH 
MORE CONTROLLED THAN I EXPECTED A A LOT MORE CONTROL YOU NEVER KNOW 
WHAT IT TOOK OUT OF HIM LAST NIGHT 
A LOT OF THIS EMMERS SAID THE 
FINALS DO FINISH LATE BY THE TIME 
YOU HAVE GOT YOUR MEDALS DANBY 
PRESS CONFERENCES AND HAD THE DRUGS 
TESTING SOME OF THEM GET INTO BED 
AT AND THEN GETTING UP FOR 
TODAY QUITE TOUGH ACTUALLY 
IN THE EARLY HOURS 
NATHAN WAS A FRACTION SLOWER KEBBAB NEARLY MISSED THE SEMI FINAL AND HE HAS GONE IN SECOND THIS REALLY IS A FANTASTIC FACILITY 
IT IS PROBABLY THE BEST SHORT 
COURSE FACILITY WE HAVE SEEN IN 
GREAT BRITAIN IT IS THE FIRST TIME 
WE'VE EVER HELD THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP IN GREAT BRITAIN THEY THEY HAVE LIMITED SO WELL AS WELL POOL 
IN BLUE WITH A BLACK BACKGROUND IS 
FANTASTIC 
THEY'RE VERY TIGHT AREN'T THEY HE HE HAS 
IT WAS NOT AS QUICK AS YOU HAS SWUM THIS MORNING L. KNOW YOU ARE DISAPPOINTED 
I AM PLEASED WITH THE DISAPPOINTED RESULT IT IS MY FIRST SEMI FINAL 
THE TIME WASN'T THE BEST BUT IT IS 
THE SEMI FINAL SO WHATEVER HAPPENS 
HAPPENS 
HE MOVED OVER FROM HAPPENS TENERIFE TO SWANSEA TO TRAIN IN THE 
U. K. 
I'M REALLY PLEASED TO READ THE U. K. MOVE 
WE ARE GLAD YOU DID AS WELL MOVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
ANOTHER MEDAL CEREMONY FOR THE FIFTY 
METRES BACKSTROKE GREAT BRITAIN 
HAVE ALREADY HAD THEIR MOST 
SUCCESSFUL MEAT EVER 
SO THE BRONZE MEDAL GOES TO ASHLEY 
DELANEY OF AUSTRALIA VERY VERY 
CLOSE AT THE END HE ONLY MISSED 
THE GOLD MEDAL BY EIGHTY ONE HUNDREDTHS OF 
A SECOND 
GREAT BRITAIN ARE HAVING THEIR MOST 
SUCCESSFUL WORLD SHORT COURSE EVER 
A SILVER MEDAL A BRILLIANT SILVER 
MEDAL TO LIAM TANCOCK WHAT SAY 
CHAMPIONSHIPS LIAM TANCOCK IS 
HAVING 
HE HAS HAD THREE MEDALS SO HAVING FAR THIS IS ONE GUY THAT SHOULD 
TAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE 
FROM THIS HE IS POSTING WORLD 
CLASS TIMES HIS CONFIDENCE SHOULD 
BE VERY HIGH 
SIX YEARS AGO PETER MARSHALL WENT 
TO THE SHORT COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
AND WON A SILVER ON THE FIFTY METRES 
NOW IN TWO THOUSAND LINNET HE IS THE 
WORLD CHAMPION IN TWO THOUSAND AND DATE 
HE TIMED IT TO PERFECTION THE 
START WAS GOOD THE TURN WAS VERY 
GOOD INDEED L. THINK THAT IS WHAT WON IT FOR HIM 
AMERICA ARE STILL TO HAVE THEIR 
OLYMPIC TRIALS L. WONDER IF WE WILL 
SEE PETER MARSHALL IN BEIJING IN 
FOUR MONTHS' TIME THEY WILL 
CERTAINLY BE SEEING LIAM TANCOCK 
WILL ALSO BE SEEN AS SHE DELANEY 
FOR AUSTRALIA WHO WON THE 
AUSTRALIAN TRIALS IN THE HUNDRED 
BACK IT IS GOING TO BE A SUPER 
RACE IN BEIJING 
YOU CAN TELL HE IS AMERICAN BECAUSE 
HE'S GOT CREPES GREAT TEETH THE 
BOYS WERE TALKING ABOUT EGO IN THE 
TWO SEMI FINALS THAT WE HAVE SEEN 
WHAT IS THE IDEAL PERCENTAGE 
BETWEEN THE EGO AND HUMANITY 
PRESUMABLY HE NEEDED TO THINK 
YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD 
WHEN IT COMES 
TO HUMIDITY IT IS THE PERFECT 
BALANCE TO EAGER HUMILITY IS THE 
PERFECT BALANCE TOO EAGER TOO MUCH 
EGO HE WORRY ABOUT THINGS TOO MUCH 
AND GET TO UP TIRED WHEN YOU HAVE 
NO CONFIDENCE YOU DON'T BELIEVE HE 
GOT THE SELF BELIEF OF HUMILITY IS 
THE PERFECT BALANCE EVICTING GOING 
TO A RACE LIKE THAT AND BE FOCUSED 
ON YOUR OWN RACE THAT IS THE 
PERFECT BALANCE TO HAVE 
SO THOUGH 
YOU ARE VERY GOOD AND LET OTHER 
PEOPLE SAY IT 
I THINK SO YOU'VE 
GOT TO HAVE SELF CONFIDENCE BUT EAT 
BEING EGOTISTICAL THE ONE LIKE 
THAT FOR STARTERS L. DO THAT IT IS 
GOOD FEEL PERFORMERS 
IN THE 
AUSTRALIAN SET UP YOU ARE STRUCK 
WAY AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS NEVER BEEN 
A PRIMA DONNA IAN THORPE WAS NOT 
EITHER 
WHEN YOU ARE SHOWING TOO EITHER MUCH OF IT A GO YOU'RE TRYING TO 
SHOW COMPETITORS THAT YOU ARE GOOD 
AND ARE TRYING TO PROMOTE YOURSELF 
IF YOU ARE CALM AND RELAXED THAT 
IS THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE YOURSELF 
BECAUSE YOU ARE FOCUSED AND WILL 
SURVIVE YOUR OWN PERFORMANCE AT 
THE END OF THE DAY YOU GOT TO BE 
SITTING IN BALANCE WITH YOURSELF 
NOT SHOWING OFF TO ANYBODY THAT 
THE RESULTS DO THE TALKING 
WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT IN THOUGHT THE OTHER 
DAY BECAUSE WE WERE WONDERING WHAT 
HE IS DOING NOW 
HE IS STILL SOME 
WORK AND TELEVISION HE IS SIGNED 
TO A CABLE NETWORK HE HAS GOT 
SPONSORSHIPS BECAUSE HE HAS A HIGH 
PROFILE WORLDWIDE LOVE WORLD 
WIDE I SAW HIM AT THE OLYMPIC 
TRIALS IT WOULD BE GOOD TO SEE HIM 
ILLICIT AGAIN BUT I DON'T THINK IT 
WILL HAPPEN 
HE IS TOO RICH FOR 
THAT HE DOESN'T SAY THE MONEY THE THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS HE DOING THE 
ANSWER IS ANYTHING 
MORE BRITISH

NEW COMMONWEALTH RECORD CAN FOSTER 
WIN HIS SEVENTH WORLD SHORT COURSE 
TITLE INDIVIDUALLY HE IS IN THREE

QUICK HE IS RIGHT ON IT NOW MARK 
FOSTER HAS GOT TO GO HE IS FIRST
