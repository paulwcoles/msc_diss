LIKE MANY EUROPEANS OF HIS ERA 
THE MILLIONAIRE FINANCIER AND PHILANTHROPIST ALBERT KAHN 
WAS FASCINATED BY THE PEOPLE AND CULTURES OF THE ORIENT 
BETWEEN NINETEEN FOURTEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN HE DISPATCHED PHOTOGRAPHERS ON A SERIES OF ASSIGNMENTS IN THE FAR EAST 
USING THE NEW AUTOCHROME CAMERA TECHNOLOGY THEY RECORDED MANY STRIKING PICTURES 
FOR KAHN'S GROWING ARCHIVE OF THE PLANET 
SOME OF THE MOST CAPTIVATING IMAGES 
WERE SHOT IN THE TERRITORY KNOWN AS FRENCH INDOCHINA 
COUNTRIES WE KNOW TODAY AS VIETNAM AND CAMBODIA 
IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN ALBERT KAHN'S MISSION TO CREATE A PHOTOGRAPHIC ARCHIVE 
OF LIFE ON THE PLANET WAS GATHERING PACE 
FROM HIS MANSION ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF PARIS KAHN WAS SENDING PHOTOGRAPHERS ALL AROUND THE GLOBE 
TO RECORD THE RICHNESS AND VARIETY OF HUMAN CULTURE 
IN MAY OF THAT YEAR LEON BUSY AN OFFICER IN THE FRENCH COLONIAL ARMY 
APPROACHED THE ARCHIVE OFFERING HIS SERVICES 
HE HAD HEARD ABOUT KAHN'S AMBITIOUS PLANS AND WAS KEEN TO BECOME INVOLVED 
LEON BUSY WAS A GIFTED AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER 
GOOD ENOUGH TO HAVE WON A PRIZE 
FROM THE FRENCH PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY 
IT WAS GREAT TO HAVE A MAN LIKE THIS VOLUNTEERING TO WORK FOR KAHN 
BUSY WAS STATIONED IN VIETNAM THE MOST IMPORTANT COUNTRY IN FRANCE'S FAR EASTERN EMPIRE 
THE FRENCH HAD BEEN IN VIETNAM SINCE THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTIES 
BUT IT HAD TAKEN MANY YEARS OF BITTER FIGHTING TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE COUNTRY 
BY THE END OF THE CENTURY 
NEIGHBOURING LAOS AND CAMBODIA HAD ALSO BECOME FRENCH PROTECTORATES 
TOGETHER THE THREE COUNTRIES WERE KNOWN AS INDOCHINA 
IT WAS A HUGE SPARSELY POPULATED TERRITORY MUCH OF IT COVERED IN DENSE FORESTS 
BUSY TOOK MOST OF HIS PICTURES FOR THE KAHN ARCHIVE IN THE PROVINCE OF TONKIN NEXT TO THE CHINESE BORDER 
UNLIKE MOST FRENCH COLONIALS BUSY WAS SO FASCINATED WITH VIETNAMESE CULTURE 
THAT HE TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LEARN THE LOCAL LANGUAGE 
THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING SOMEONE WORKING FOR YOU WHO KNEW THE COUNTRY SO WELL 
WAS THAT HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE LOCAL PEOPLE AND IN THE END 
YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH HE EMPATHISED WITH THEM 
BECAUSE HE'D LIVED THERE FOR SO LONG AND KNEW THEM SO WELL 
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW A BIG WHITE MAN CAME ROUND WITH HIS CAMERA 
TO TAKE PICTURES BUT HE CLEARLY ENJOYED SHARING SOME MOMENTS WITH THEM 
AND NOBODY LOOKS SORT OF SCARED OF THE FRENCHMAN 
IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN VIETNAM WAS A MOSTLY RURAL SOCIETY OF SOME FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE 
VIETNAM IS A COUNTRYSIDE NATION SO VILLAGE LIFE WAS EVERYTHING 
WHEN THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN 
NINETY EIGHT NINETY NINE PER CENT OF THE VIETNAMESE WERE LIVING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
RICE WAS THE CENTRAL ELEMENT OF THE LOCAL DIET THROUGHOUT VIETNAM 
ITS PRODUCTION MEANT UNRELENTING TOIL IN THE PADDY FIELDS 
IN VIETNAMESE SOCIETY 
EVERYBODY WHEN THEY BECAME EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD 
THE VILLAGE GAVE THEM PIECES OF LAND 
TO PLANT RICE TO GET SOMETHING FOR YOU TO EAT 
RICE IS EVERYTHING TO A VIETNAMESE FAMILY 
IN SPITE OF BEING BLESSED WITH TWO ANNUAL RICE HARVESTS 
IN TONKIN THERE WAS RARELY ENOUGH TO FEED EVERYONE 
THESE PHOTOGRAPHS OF A GROUP OF BEGGARS 
WERE TAKEN ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF HANOI IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN 
I THINK THERE'S ONE THAT IS REALLY STRONG I THINK IT HOLDS UP TODAY 
THE LIGHT IS RIGHT THE BODY LANGUAGE IS EXCEPTIONAL 
THE WOMAN HAS ALL OF HER CHILDREN KIND OF SPREAD OUT ON THE STREET 
IT LOOKS DESPERATE 
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE IN PAIN THEY ALL LOOK LIKE THEY'RE READY TO DIE 
IT'S VERY DRAMATIC AND I THINK IT'S PULLED OFF 
YOU KNOW EXTRAORDINARILY WELL 
IN VIETNAM HOWEVER THINGS WEREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEMED 
IN THOSE PHOTOS I WOULD SAY SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE BEEN PROFESSIONAL BEGGARS FROM SOME VILLAGES 
THEY ARE SEASONAL BEGGARS NOT HOMELESS 
THEY HAD A HOUSE 
SO WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THE WORK IN THE PADDY FIELDS 
THEY GO OUT TO BIG CITIES BEGGING YOU KNOW 
THOUGH VIETNAM WAS A POOR COUNTRY IT HAD A RICH AND VIBRANT CULTURE 
IN TONKIN WRESTLING WAS A POPULAR SPORT 
THESE MEN ARE PRAYING TO THEIR VILLAGE GODS FOR SUCCESS IN UPCOMING BOUTS 
THE LARGER VILLAGES HOSTED TOURING THEATRE COMPANIES 
AND MANY HAD THEIR OWN TROUPES OF AMATEUR ACTORS 
THESE BRIGHTLY DRESSED GIRLS LOOK LIKE ACTORS IN UNIFORM 
BUT IN FACT THEY ARE HUMAN CHESS PIECES 
WELL YOU WOULDN'T PLAY HUMAN CHESS EVERY DAY 
BUT YOU WOULD SEE IT AT THE TET FESTIVAL THE SPRING FESTIVAL 
A FAMILY WOULD BE VERY HONOURED IF THEIR CHILDREN 
YOUNG GIRLS OR YOUNG BOYS ARE CHOSEN TO PLAY ON THE HUMAN CHESS BOARD 
CULTURALLY TONKIN WAS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY ITS NORTHERN NEIGHBOUR CHINA 
IN THE PAST THE REGION HAD BEEN ADMINISTERED BY COURT APPOINTED MANDARINS 
BY THE TIME BUSY TOOK THESE PICTURES 
THE FRENCH HAD STRIPPED THEM OF MUCH OF THEIR POWER 
BUT THEY COULDN'T TAKE AWAY THEIR PRIDE 
OR THEIR GLORIOUS COSTUMES 
IN FEUDAL VIETNAM NORMAL MAN CANNOT WEAR ANY KIND OF ROBE OR DRESS 
WITH DRAGON BECAUSE IT SYMBOLISES POWER AND A STATE OF AUTHORITY 
IN THIS PICTURE THIS MAN HIS CLOTHES HAS SOME DRAGONS IN 
GREEN COLOUR SO HE MUST BE SOMEBODY OF SIGNIFICANT STATUS 
ELDERS OCCUPIED THE NEXT RUNG DOWN IN THE VILLAGE PECKING ORDER 
FOLLOWED BY THE EDUCATED CLASSES 
THIS IS A LOCAL SCRIBE THE READER AND WRITER OF LETTERS 
HE WEARS HIS NAILS LONG AS A BADGE OF HONOUR THIS MAN NEVER GOES NEAR A PADDY FIELD 
HERE IS A TEACHER 
HIS TALL CHAIR SIGNIFIES HIS ELEVATED SOCIAL POSITION 
AND THIS AUTOCHROME SHOWS A BUDDHIST PRIESTESS WITH AN UNUSUAL SYMBOL OF HER STATUS 
THE PRESENCE OF THE ALARM CLOCK IS STRANGE 
BUT I THINK IT IS A SYMBOL OF WEALTH FOR THE TEMPLE 
BECAUSE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO AN ALARM CLOCK WAS VERY RARE IN RURAL VIETNAM 
VIETNAM WAS A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS COUNTRY 
IMPORTED BELIEFS SUCH AS BUDDHISM FROM INDIA AND CONFUCIANISM FROM CHINA 
COEXISTED WITH LOCAL CULTS AND THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL PRACTICE OF ANCESTOR WORSHIP 
THE DEAD WERE VERY MUCH ALIVE IN THE MINDS OF VIETNAMESE PEASANTS 
THEY LEFT FOOD FOR DECEASED ANCESTORS ON ALTARS INSIDE THEIR HOUSES 
AND OUTSIDE THEIR VILLAGES 
ON IMPORTANT ANNIVERSARIES THEY BURNT PAPER MODELS 
TO SEND PRESENTS TO THEIR RELATIVES IN THE AFTERLIFE 
EVERY JULY ON THE DAY OF FIRST FULL MOON 
CEREMONIES WERE CARRIED OUT TO RELEASE ANY POOR SOULS WHO WERE TRAPPED IN THE UNDERWORLD 
THIS PRIEST IS PERFORMING IN FRONT OF A PAPER MODEL 
OF ONE OF THE TEN COURTS OF HELL 
HE USES HIS STAFF TO SYMBOLICALLY SMASH OPEN ITS GATES AND SET THE SPIRITS FREE 
ANYONE WHO WANTED TO TALK DIRECTLY TO A DEAD RELATIVE COULD HOLD A SEANCE WITH THEM VIA A MEDIUM 
SHE WOULD HAVE WHITE POWDERED FACE BECAUSE SHE'S 
BETWEEN DEAD AND ALIVE 
BETWEEN THE TWO WORLDS SHE WOULD CONNECT YOU WITH THE DEAD 
DURING HIS TIME IN THE COLONY 
BUSY RECORDED AN ASTONISHINGLY RICH CROSS SECTION OF VIETNAMESE LIFE 
FROM RICH MEN TO LEPERS 
FROM THE VERY OLD TO THE VERY YOUNG 
ACTORS 
FACTORY GIRLS 
SAILORS 
MUSICIANS 
BUT VERY VERY FEW FRENCH MEN AND WOMEN 
OCCASIONALLY IN HIS PICTURES OF HANOI 
THERE ARE FRENCH BUILDINGS AND HOARDINGS WITH WESTERN ADVERTISING 
YET THE COLONISTS THEMSELVES APPEAR ONLY AS TINY FIGURES 
ON THE EDGE OF FRAME 
DWARFED BY THE LANDSCAPE AND LOST IN THE BACKGROUND 
BUT HIS PICTURES DO SHOW THEIR IMPACT ON VIETNAM 
THE FRENCH BUILT CATHEDRALS AND OPERA HOUSES 
AND CREATED ROADS AND RAILWAYS TO OPEN UP INDOCHINA TO TRADE 
THIS IS THE DOUMER BRIDGE NEAR HANOI 
CONSTRUCTED IN NINETEEN OH TWO BY THE WORLD FAMOUS EIFFEL COMPANY 
THE DOUMER BRIDGE IS A HUGE LUMP OF METAL 
VERY SOLID AND QUITE HANDSOME REALLY 
IT IS ABOUT TWO K. M. LONG THE LONGEST BRIDGE IN THE WORLD AT THAT TIME 
THE FRENCH DIDN'T PAY A PENNY IT WAS THE VIETNAMESE PEASANTS WHO PAID FOR IT 
THROUGH VERY HEAVY TAXES ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS 
THE EUROPEANS DIDN'T PAY ANY TAXES 
FRENCH TRADERS GREW WEALTHY BY EXPLOITING VIETNAM'S NATURAL RESOURCES 
WHILE MANY PEASANTS WENT HUNGRY 
COLONIAL BUSINESSMEN TURNED VIETNAM INTO ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST EXPORTERS OF RICE 
THERE WAS ALSO MONEY TO BE MADE ON THE DOMESTIC MARKET 
THE COLONY'S BUDGET DEPENDED ON REVENUES FROM STATE MONOPOLIES ON SALT ALCOHOL 
AND OPIUM 
IN EVERY TOWN THERE WOULD BE A BUILDING WITH A FRENCH FLAG OUTSIDE IT WITH R. O. MARKED ON IT 
REGIE DE L'OPIUM 
THE FRENCH ENCOURAGED 
THE VIETNAMESE TO USE TO SMOKE OPIUM 
THEY OPENED A NETWORK OF OPIUM SHOPS AND SMOKING ROOMS 
THE VIETNAMESE WERE THEIR SUBJECTS TO EXPLOIT 
THERE WERE FORTUNES BUILT ON THE SALE OF OPIUM 
OVERALL PROFITS FROM OPIUM ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE PER CENT OF THE COLONIAL BUDGET 
OPIUM WAS USUALLY THE PRESERVE OF MEN 
BUT ONE OF BUSY'S MOST STRIKING IMAGES IS THIS STUDY OF A YOUNG WOMAN 
SURROUNDED BY THE PARAPHERNALIA OF OPIUM SMOKING 
LIKE MANY FRENCHMEN IN THE COLONY BUSY WAS FASCINATED BY THE WOMEN OF INDOCHINA 
I THINK HIS PICTURES OF WOMEN ARE THE BEST WORK HE PRODUCED 
I CAN ALMOST SEE SOME OF THESE PICTURES BEING IN A FASHION MAGAZINE TODAY 
THE BACKGROUND IS CONSIDERED THE LIGHT'S VERY SOFT AND WONDERFUL 
AND THE POSES OFTEN ARE VERY FRESH AND NATURAL 
I THINK A PHOTOGRAPHER TODAY WOULD BE VERY PROUD TO HAVE TAKEN THOSE SAME PICTURES 
BUSY EVEN PERSUADED ONE YOUNG WOMAN TO STRIP OFF IN FRONT OF CAMERA 
FOR PROPRIETY'S SAKE HE SHOT IT TASTEFULLY OUT OF FOCUS 
THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL RATIONALE FOR THE FILM 
IS PROBABLY INTEREST IN COSTUME AND CLOTHES ET CETERA 
AND SO SURE THERE IS AN ATTEMPT TO PROTECT 
THE SORT OF SANCTITY OF THIS VIEW BY SHOOTING OUT OF FOCUS BY RESPECTING THIS WOMAN 
YET AT THE SAME TIME IT IS INEVITABLE THAT THERE IS 
A VOYEURISTIC ELEMENT THAT'S OVERLAID WITHIN THIS FILM 
THERE WERE FEW WOMEN IN THE WORLD OF THE EUROPEANS VERY VERY FEW WOMEN 
SO THE MEN THE EUROPEANS WERE ALWAYS ON THE LOOK OUT FOR FEMALE COMPANY 
THEY COULD ONLY FIND IT AMONGST LOCAL WOMEN 
BUSY'S PICTURES PORTRAY VIETNAM AS A CALM ORDERLY COLONY BUT THE POLITICAL REALITY WAS DIFFERENT 
AS A SOLDIER IN THE FRENCH ARMY 
HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE FRENCH NEVER MANAGED TO PACIFY VIETNAM 
THROUGHOUT THEIR RULE THERE WERE SMALL SCALE INSURRECTIONS 
THE FRENCH RESPONDED BY BRUTALLY SUPPRESSING ANY OPPOSITION 
AND TRYING TO WIN OVER ENOUGH LOCAL PEOPLE TO OVERCOME RESISTANCE TO THEIR PRESENCE 
THIS PHOTOGRAPH SHOWS HOANG TRONG PHU 
THE FRENCH APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF TONKIN 
DENOUNCED BY MANY AS A COLLABORATOR 
HE WORKED DIRECTLY WITH THE FRENCH TO CONQUER THE NORTH 
SO HE IS A HATE FIGURE IN VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST TEXTBOOKS 
ELSEWHERE IN INDOCHINA THE FRENCH FOUND IT EASIER TO MAINTAIN THEIR POWER 
IN NEIGHBOURING CAMBODIA THEY GOVERNED WITH A LIGHT TOUCH AND FACED LITTLE OPPOSITION 
IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES CAMBODIA WAS A DEEPLY SPIRITUAL NATION 
WHERE EVERY LOCAL MAN HAD TO SPEND AT LEAST A YEAR IN A MONASTERY 
BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE LAND WAS REGULARLY FLOODED 
MANY HOUSES WERE BUILT ON STILTS 
THIS IS ETERNAL CAMBODIA 
IF YOU TELL ME THAT THIS IMAGE WAS TOOK YESTERDAY 
I WOULD BELIEVE YOU 
BECAUSE THIS IS THE 
TRADITIONAL CAMBODIA AS IT ALWAYS WAS 
THIS UNUSUAL PHOTOGRAPH SHOWS A CAMBODIAN OFFICIAL 
WORKING IN THE FRENCH COLONIAL SERVICE 
THESE PHOTOGRAPHS GIVE YOU A FEELING 
OF THE TRANSITIONAL QUALITY OF THINGS IN CAMBODIA 
IN THIS PERIOD BETWEEN MODERNITY AND TRADITION 
YOU CAN SEE SOME MODERN ELEMENTS 
THE HAT THE MOUSTACHE THE BOW TIE BUT HE'S ALSO DRESSED IN CAMBODIAN STYLE WITH HIS SAMPOT TROUSERS 
THE INTERESTING THING IS THE WAY IT IS ALL MIXED UP 
CAMBODIA HAD NEITHER THE RAW MATERIALS NOR THE POPULATION OF VIETNAM 
SO IT COULDN'T GENERATE HUGE SUMS OF MONEY FOR FRANCE 
BUT IT DID POSSESS ONE OF THE GLORIES OF INDOCHINA 
THE TEMPLE COMPLEX OF ANGKOR 
BUILT BY THE ANCIENT KINGS OF CAMBODIA ANGKOR HAD BEEN LARGELY ABANDONED IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY 
WHEN PHNOM PENH BECAME THE CAPITAL CITY 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY IT WAS VISITED BY THE FRENCH EXPLORER HENRI MOOR 
EUROPE WAS ENTHRALLED BY HIS SENSATIONAL ACCOUNT OF AMAZING TEMPLES 
AND DRAMATIC RUINS CLOAKED IN DENSE FOREST 
WHEN BUSY FIRST APPROACHED KAHN HE HAD PROMISED TO MAKE ANGKOR A PRIORITY 
ANGKOR WAS A VERY PRESTIGIOUS SITE IN THAT ERA 
YOU WERE DEALING WITH A SET OF RUINS WHICH COULD BE COMPARED TO THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON 
THERE WAS NOTHING COMPARABLE IN THE WORLD 
WITH ALL THAT HISTORY ALL THOSE MEMORIES PRESERVED IN ITS WALLS AND TEMPLES 
THE ARCHIVES OF THE PLANET JUST HAD TO HAVE IT 
IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN TWENTY ONE BUSY JOURNEYED ACROSS THE MEKONG TO GET HIS FIRST GLIMPSE 
OF THE MAGNIFICENT RUINS OF ANGKOR 
HIS FILM AND PHOTOGRAPHS DEPICT AN ARCHETYPAL LOST CITY 
FULL OF EXOTIC STATUES AND MYSTERIOUS WALL CARVINGS 
THE TALLEST AND BEST PRESERVED BUILDING WAS CALLED ANGKOR WAT 
THE TEMPLE OF THE CITY 
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE SYMBOL OF CAMBODIA 
THIS IS THE LARGEST THE BIGGEST THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE 
YOU CAN HARDLY CRITICISE WHEN YOU SEE THE GENERAL PLAN OF ANGKOR WAT 
IF YOU ARE AN ARCHITECT YOU CAN HARDLY FIND A FAILURE EVERYTHING IS PERFECT 
BUSY TOOK NUMEROUS PICTURES OF ANGKOR WAT 
BUT LIKE MANY LATER PHOTOGRAPHERS 
HE WAS ALSO DRAWN TO ANOTHER TEMPLE BUILT NEARBY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS LATER 
THE BAYON 
IT HAD THESE ENORMOUS FACES 
THREE OR FOUR METRES HIGH IT SEEMS LIKE 
THERE'S MAYBE SEVENTY AND THEY ARE ALL LOOKING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS 
I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF PHOTOGRAPHING IN BAYON 
IS TO TRY AND GET AS MANY FACES IN THE SAME FRAME 
AND I THINK IN A COUPLE OF HIS PHOTOGRAPHS HE HAS BEEN VERY CLEVER 
TO BE ABLE TO FIND THE RIGHT VANTAGE POINT 
IN ADDITION TO THE SMALL ARMY OF CAMBODIANS EMPLOYED BY THE FRENCH TO CLEAR THE SITE 
BUSY FOUND THE LOST CITY OF ANGKOR TO BE A SURPRISINGLY BUSY PLACE 
HIS TRIP COINCIDED WITH AN OFFICIAL VISIT BY A SIAMESE PRINCE AND HIS ENTOURAGE 
HE PHOTOGRAPHED LOCAL BOYS FISHING WITH BAMBOO BASKETS IN A TEMPLE MOAT 
AND A CAMBODIAN FAMILY IN FRONT OF THEIR COUNTRY'S MOST IMPORTANT MONUMENT 
INSIDE ANGKOR WAT HE TOOK DOZENS OF PORTRAITS OF MONKS 
IT WAS BUILT TO REPRESENT MOUNT MERU 
WHICH IN HINDUISM IS THE HOME OF THE GODS 
BUT OVER THE CENTURIES ANGKOR WAT HAD BECOME AN IMPORTANT SITE FOR CAMBODIAN BUDDHISTS 
I GUESS THAT IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT LIKE MUSLIM PEOPLE WHO GO TO MECCA 
YOU WISH THAT AT LEAST ONCE IN YOUR LIFE YOU HAVE TO SEE ANGKOR WAT 
AT ANGKOR WAT BUSY ENCOUNTERED A TROUPE OF CAMBODIAN DANCERS 
HE WAS ENTRANCED 
IN CAMBODIA DANCE WAS FAR MORE THAN ENTERTAINMENT 
ACCORDING TO ONE FOUNDING MYTH THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE WERE DESCENDED 
FROM THE HOLY UNION OF A HERMIT AND A CELESTIAL DANCER 
DANCERS IN A WAY ARE THE LINK BETWEEN THE HUMAN AND THE DIVINE 
AND THE DANCE HAD A RITUAL FUNCTION 
FOR EXAMPLE THE MONI MEKHALA DANCE IS ACTUALLY A RAIN DANCE 
IT'S A BATTLE BETWEEN A STORM DEMON AND A SEA NYMPH A SEA GODDESS 
AND WHEN THUNDER AND LIGHTNING GO AT EACH OTHER 
IT BRINGS RAIN TO NOURISH THE RICE FIELDS OF CAMBODIA 
BUSY CARRIED ON TO PHNOM PENH WHERE HE FILMED THE KING'S OWN PERSONAL TROUPE 
THIS UNIQUE FILM SHOWS THE ROYAL BALLET IN REHEARSAL 
SIMPLY BECAUSE NO ONE WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM 
NO NO ONE EXCEPT LITERALLY THE DANCERS AND THE KING 
IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES DURING THE MURDEROUS RULE OF THE KHMER ROUGE 
NINETY PER CENT OF THE DANCERS IN CAMBODIA'S ROYAL BALLET WERE EITHER KILLED OR EXILED 
THE CARNAGE ALMOST DESTROYED A TRADITION WHICH HAD LASTED HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
EM THEAY IS ONE OF THE FEW DANCERS TO HAVE SURVIVED THE TURMOIL OF THE KHMER ROUGE ERA 
TODAY SHE TEACHES IN PHNOM PENH DEMONSTRATING TO A NEW GENERATION 
THE SKILLS BUSY PHOTOGRAPHED IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
THE TRAINING WAS VERY TOUGH 
THE TEACHER WAS ALWAYS HITTING US 
AND THEY WOULD PINCH US AND TWIST US IN ORDER TO MAKE US DANCE PROPERLY 
YOU WOULD SPEND THE WHOLE MORNING TRAINING TO MAKE YOUR HANDS SUPPLE 
THEY WOULD GET ME TO BEND MY FINGERS AND THEN TO DO THIS 
AND THEN TO SHOW THIS 
THE FINGERS CURVED LIKE THORNS ON AN ORANGE TREE 
ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL BALLET LIVED WITHIN THE PALACE COMPOUND IN THE QUARTERS OF THE KING'S HAREM 
THE ROYAL FAMILY ITSELF WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN TRAINING THE DANCERS 
PRINCESS BUPPHA DEVI SISTER TO THE PRESENT KING OF CAMBODIA 
WAS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS DANCERS OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
IN THOSE DAYS 
THE DANCERS FROM THE ROYAL BALLET WERE ALL ONE BIG FAMILY 
AND THE KING LOOKED AFTER THAT FAMILY 
EVERYONE LIVED WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE ROYAL PALACE 
MOTHERS WITH THEIR CHILDREN 
AND THE SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES WERE PASSED FROM MOTHER TO DAUGHTER GENERATION TO GENERATION 
THE COSTUMES WORN BY THE DANCERS WERE HUGELY ELABORATE 
IT WAS A PERFORMANCE IN ITSELF JUST TO GET INTO THEM 
THE CORSET HAD TO BE VERY TIGHT 
IF IT WASN'T IT WOULD BE UNCOMFORTABLE TO DANCE IN 
A TIGHT CORSET GAVE YOU A VERY STRAIGHT BACK 
IF NOT YOU WOULD JUST SLUMP 
SO THE TIGHTER THE BETTER REALLY 
WE DIDN'T HAVE ZIPS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
COSTUMES WERE ACTUALLY SEWN ON TO THE DANCERS 
BY THE TIME BUSY SHOT THIS FILM THE CAMBODIAN ROYAL BALLET WAS ALREADY FAMOUS IN EUROPE 
AFTER THEIR PERFORMANCE AT A FESTIVAL OF COLONIAL ART IN FRANCE 
THEY GOT TO MARSEILLE AND WERE JUST ABSOLUTELY THE KNOCK OUT HIT OF THE FESTIVAL 
THEY WERE PERFORMING INDOORS AND THERE WERE SUCH RIOTS OF PEOPLE 
TRYING TO GET IN THAT THEY MOVED THE PERFORMANCES OUTDOORS AND THEY PLAYED FOR THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A NIGHT 
THERE WAS A REAL APPRECIATION THAT THERE COULD BE TRUE AND BRILLIANT ART 
IN ONE OF THESE NATIVE PLACES 
IN CAMBODIA YOU CAN STILL FIND FRENCH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES 
BUT THE COLONIAL MASTERS ARE LONG GONE 
FRANCE LOST CONTROL OF INDOCHINA IN THE MID NINETEEN FIFTIES 
YOU CAN STILL SEE THEIR LEGACY IN THE ARCHITECTURE OF HANOI AND PHNOM PENH 
BUT TODAY CAMBODIA AND VIETNAM ARE INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES 
IN CHARGE OF THEIR OWN DESTINY 
AT ANGKOR THE BUILDINGS THEMSELVES HAVEN'T CHANGED THAT MUCH SINCE BUSY PHOTOGRAPHED THEM 
WHAT HAS CHANGED IS THE NUMBER OF TOURISTS 
WHEN LEON BUSY CAME HERE IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE 
THERE WERE A FEW HUNDRED VISITORS PER YEAR 
TODAY THERE ARE MORE THAN A MILLION 
LITERALLY CRAWLING OVER THE MONUMENTS 
THE KAHN ARCHIVES OFFER A GLIMPSE OF A WORLD BEFORE GLOBALISATION 
A TIME WHEN TRAVELLING TO JAPAN OR INDOCHINA OR INDIA 
MEANT WEEKS ON AN OCEAN LINER NOT HOURS ABOARD A JUMBO JET 
THEY SHOW THE CONTOURS OF A WORLD BEFORE THE MOBILE PHONE AND THE INTERNET CAFE 
WHERE TRADITIONAL COSTUMES PREVAILED 
AND WHERE LACQUERED BLACK TEETH COULD BE THE HEIGHT OF LOCAL FASHION 
AS KAHN INSTINCTIVELY UNDERSTOOD 
THOUGH THE MODERN WORLD COULD CREATE 
IT COULD ALSO DESTROY 
WHAT WAS VITAL WAS TO RECORD THE OLD WORLD BEFORE IT VANISHED 
EEK EEK OOH OOH HOWL 
EEK EEK OOH OOH HOWL
