IT'S DOING VERY WELL NOW TALKING ABOUT PROFITS HERE'S YOUR THREE HUNDRED 
THANK YOU THE STALLS ARE THAT WAY AND THE BEER TENT IS THAT WAY 
THAT SHOWS WHERE THEIR INTERESTS LIE 
WILL THEY BE SPENDING THEIR MONEY WISELY OR IS THERE TROUBLE BREWING 
ON TOUR WITH THE REDS IS CATHERINE SOUTHON 
WHILE JAMES BRAXTON BROWSES FOR BARGAINS WITH THE BLUES 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE A LOVELY SELECTION OF ARTS AND CRAFTS TILES 
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL SHAPES AND THIS WONDERFUL FLEUR DE LIS PATTERN 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT IS THAT THEY ARE ARTS AND CRAFTS STYLE 
ARTS AND CRAFTS WAS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTIES STARTED BY WILLIAM MORRIS AND SUCH LIKE 
THEIR IDEA WAS TO GET SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE BUT NOT TOO ELABORATE 
I CAM IMAGINE SOMEBODY BUYING THESE AND PERHAPS HAVING THEM AS A FIRE SURROUND 
THEY'RE REALLY STUNNING VERY BEAUTIFUL LET'S LOOK AT THEM IN MORE DETAIL 
THEY'VE GOT THIS CIRCULAR STAMP THEIR FACTORY STAMP 
THEY'VE ALSO GOT THIS REGISTERED NUMBER 
WHICH DATES IT TO ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FOUR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WHAT WORRIES ME SLIGHTLY IS THEY ARE IN PERFECT CONDITION 
THERE'S NO CHIPS OR DAMAGE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
SO IT MIGHT BE THAT THEY ARE NOT ANTIQUE 
BUT THEY ARE ARTS AND CRAFTS STYLE RATHER THAN FROM THAT PERIOD 
BUT IT WOULD SELL WELL IN A GENERAL AUCTION WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I REALLY LIKE THEM I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THAT ERA 
I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE STRONG COLOUR YOU DON'T SEE THAT COLOUR AS MUCH 
IT'S VERY VIVID MAKES A CHANGE THAT THEY'RE NOT SQUARE TILES 
I'VE HAD A WORD WITH THE LADY 
SHE'S CONVINCED THEY ARE FROM THE ARTS AND CRAFTS PERIOD 
BUT I THINK THEY MIGHT BE ARTS AND CRAFTS STYLE 
SHE'S GOT TEN OF THEM IN TOTAL 
WE'VE GOT FIVE HERE AND ANOTHER FIVE PACKED AWAY SAFELY 
SO THAT MAKES ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY BECAUSE INDIVIDUALLY THEY'RE EIGHTEEN EACH 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEEMS VERY STEEP IF THEY'RE NOT QUITE THE REAL THING 
I THINK IF WE CAN GET IT FOR ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED TWENTY WE SHOULD GIVE THEM A GO 
DEFINITELY GO OFF AND WORK YOUR MAGIC 
AND ONE HUNDRED IT WAS WELL DONE THE REDS 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT A METRONOME A METRONOME YOU'RE SPOT ON 
GREAT SCULPTURAL SHAPE LOOKS LIKE AN EGYPTIAN NEEDLE 
THAT'S WHAT ATTRACTED ME I LIKE THE WOOD VERY TACTILE WARM LOOKING 
YES IT LOOKS LIKE A MAHOGANY QUITE A LOT OF FLECKING 
I THOUGHT MAHOGANY WAS A RED A REDDISH COLOUR 
SOMETIMES IT CAN GO VERY PALE THOUGH 
OFTEN THESE THINGS STAND ON A SUNNY NOOK NEAR THE PIANO 
THIS WOULD BE ON THE PIANO FOR TIMING EXACTLY 
IN HERE WE'VE GOT THE SCALE 
IF WE START IT UP WE CAN GO FROM PRESTO TO LARGO 
BUT I NOTICE UNFORTUNATELY WHERE IS OUR TEMPERING WEIGHT 
IT DOESN'T HAVE A WEIGHT IT SHOULD HAVE A WEIGHT TO CHANGE THE SPEED 
HOW MUCH ARE THEY ASKING FOR THAT THE PRICE TAG SAYS EIGHTY 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE FOOLISH SO SOME HEAVY NEGOTIATING 
VICKY BEST PRICE PLEASE 
THEY GOT IT FOR THIRTY QUID GREAT HAGGLING 
IT'S ONLY FORTY MILES FROM DETLING TO DOVER AND THEN A SHORT HOP ACROSS THE CHANNEL 
IF YOU WANT TO POKE AROUND A FRENCH ANTIQUE MARKET AND WANT TIPS AS TO WHAT TO BUY AND WHAT NOT TO BUY 
THEN LOG ON TO OUR WEBSITE 
H. M. M. DELICIEUSE BON VOYAGE 
L'EAU C'EST PAS MON LOT NON L'EAU C'EST PAS MON LOT 
HELLO HI NICK IT'S TIM HOW ARE YOU DOING REALLY WELL 
WE'VE FOUND ONE ITEM AND WE MIGHT HAVE FOUND A SECOND GOOD 
IF YOU GIVE ME A CALL IN A LITTLE WHILE WE'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT O. K. BYE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
NOT BAD IT'S A NICE PIECE OF BAKELITE BUT YOU CAN GET THESE FAIRLY OFTEN 
IT'S IN GOOD CONDITION WHY DO YOU LIKE IT IT IS IN GOOD CONDITION 
YOU CAN TELL FROM THE HANDSET THAT THIS PHONE WAS MADE IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN 
I LIKE THE IDEA THAT ANYONE BUYING THIS CAN USE IT AT HOME IT'S BEEN CONVERTED FOR MODERN USE 
WE STILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL NUMBER LEWES FOUR THOUSAND EIGHTY NINE 
MAYBE WE SHOULD GIVE THEM A CALL PERHAPS 
ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT THERE'S ALSO THE SLIDING NOTE TRAY 
YOU LIFT THE PERSPEX PIECE UP AND WRITE YOUR PHONE NUMBERS ON THERE 
WE'VE GOT TO CONSIDER IT IS BLACK AND THAT IS THE MOST COMMON COLOUR 
IF IT WAS GREEN IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE COLLECTABLE 
YEAH IT'S INTERESTING BUT I WOULDN'T GO TOO MAD ON IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK RACHEL I LIKE IT YEAH IT'S A GOOD PIECE 
THE MOVEMENT'S NICE ON IT IT HASN'T GOT THAT NICE LITTLE BELL THING 
IT'S GOT A NICE LITTLE EDGE IT'S GOT A LOVELY SHAPE 
WOULD YOU USE THIS IN YOUR HOME YES IT'S VERY NICE 
IT'S QUITE LIGHT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HEAVIER SOMETHING YOU'D BUY 
YEAH I THINK SO I WOULD YEAH 
IF IT WAS GREEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT WOULD BE MORE INTERESTING 
IT WOULD BE NICER IN A DIFFERENT COLOUR I'D LIKE A RED TO MATCH MY TOP 
BLACK CAN FIT IN WITH ALMOST ANY COLOUR SCHEME YOU'RE RIGHT 
BUT COLLECTORS LIKE THE DIFFERENT COLOURS THE REDS THE GREENS SOMETHING A BIT MORE INTERESTING 
BUT IT IS IN FANTASTIC CONDITION 
THAT IS WHAT IT'S GOT GOING FOR IT 
BUT IT'S BLACK IT'S ORDINARY IT'S NOT GONNA GET EVERYONE GOING 
I STILL THINK IT'S WORTH GOING FOR 
IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR IT YOU GO FOR IT IF IT DOESN'T SELL WE KNOW WHO TO BLAME 
WHAT'S HE ASKING FOR THIS HE'S ASKING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
OH FAR TOO STEEP IF WE CAN GET IT DOWN TO SEVENTY EIGHTY 
I'LL TRY I'M NOT SURE HE'LL COME DOWN SO LOW BUT YOU LIKE IT YES 
THEN YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT I WILL 
NICK'S INSTINCTS WERE RIGHT BUT THE DEALER DID COME DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED 
I READ ON YOUR PROFILE THAT YOU LIKE PAPERWEIGHTS 
YES I COLLECT THEM AND I'M TAKEN WITH THIS HOW MANY HAVE YOU GOT 
NEAR ON A HUNDRED BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE WITH THE SHAPE OF AN APPLE OR THE COLOURING THAT'S GOT 
I LIKE THIS ONE TOO THE FINISH IS RATHER BIT LIKE AN OIL SLICK ON WATER 
AND NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE ROYAL DOCKYARDS DEFINITELY NOT 
IT'S ISLE OF WIGHT GLASS IT WAS MADE BY THIS CHAP MICHAEL HARRIS 
THIS ONE IS BY ONE OF HIS SONS JONATHAN HARRIS I THINK 
THIS IS FROM A SERIES CALLED SUMMER FRUITS BUT BIZARRELY WE ASSOCIATE APPLES WITH AUTUMN 
THE COLOUR IS CALLED MULBERRY AND IT'S REALLY ATTRACTIVE 
SOME OF THESE ARE SIGNED BUT UNFORTUNATELY OURS ISN'T 
IT'S GOT A PAPER LABEL KEEP THAT ON ISLE OF WIGHT GLASS 
IT'S REALLY LOVELY WHAT'S THE PRICE 
IT'S UP FOR TWENTY NINE TWENTY NINE I THOUGHT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAGGLE AGAIN 
AND HAGGLE THEY DID GETTING THE APPLE FOR TWENTY TWO 
I'M ALWAYS BANGING ON ABOUT TREEN THOSE LOVELY TURNED WOODEN OBJECTS 
BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS OF THEM ABOUT AND YOU GET THESE NOVELTIES 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS THING IS 
IF I UNCOVER THE BOTTOM PART IT LOOKS A BIT LIKE A WHISTLE 
BUT SUCH A GLOBULAR FORM FOR A WHISTLE WITH THIS NICE TURNED KNOP 
WHAT'S WITH THIS LITTLE BIT OF EBONY ON THE SIDE 
THE SECOND CLUE IS THIS INDISTINCT LABEL 
JUST PRINTED UNDERNEATH THE OLD POLISH IS A PAPER LABEL 
AND IT SAYS PIGEON AND AMP CUCKOO 
YOU'VE GOT IT IT'S A PIGEON CALLER 
IF I WAS A SPORTING MAN IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY AND I WANTED TO CALL A PIGEON OVER FROM ANOTHER TREE 
TO SIT ON THE TREE ABOVE ME 
I'D CALL IT OVER LIKE THIS WITH A REALLY SEXY NOISE PIGEON STYLE 
THE PIGEON WOULD COME FLYING OVER 
I'D GET MY GUN AND SHOOT IT FROM THE TOP OF THE TREE POOR PIGEON 
BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CALL A CUCKOO LIKE THIS 
ISN'T THAT CHARMING A TWO BIRD CALLER WHAT MORE COULD A MAN ASK FOR 
IT'S IN TURNED WOOD IT'S ORIGINAL 
AND THIS LITTLE BIRDIE CALLER COULD BE YOURS FOR ONE HUNDRED TEN 
TWIT TWOO 
RACHEL NICK TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS OH YES 
IT'S RATHER NICE GOOD AND SOLID YES A SIGN OF QUALITY 
WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE ARE INDIVIDUAL PRINTING BLOCKS 
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO PRINT POSTERS BEAUTIFULLY CARVED 
THEY'VE BEEN DONE IN BOXWOOD SO THERE'S NO GRAIN 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO DATE BUT PROBABLY MID NINETEENTH CENTURY SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I LIKE THE WOOD AND THE DEPTH AND DETAIL IN THE LETTERING 
SOMEBODY'S GONE TO A LOT OF TROUBLE TO GET ALL THOSE CURVES AND THE TINY INNER PIECES 
A LOT OF WORK HAS GONE INTO IT 
IT REMINDS ME OF THOSE OLD POSTERS YOU USED TO SEE FOR CIRCUSES 
OR MUSIC HALLS YEAH IT IS VERY SIMILAR 
IT'S NOT A COMPLETE SET 
IF YOU TOOK THESE OUT INDIVIDUALLY THEY'D SELL QUITE WELL 
BUT YOU'D HAVE TO BUY THIS AS A WHOLE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT 
I HAVE A BIT OF A THING ABOUT LETTERING TELL ME ABOUT IT 
I HAVE LOTS OF OLD PRINTING BLOCKS AT HOME 
IT IS SOMETHING YOU'D BUY THAT'S A GOOD SIGN IF YOU GO FOR IT HOPEFULLY OTHER PEOPLE WILL YES 
O. K. WE'VE GOT ONE HUNDRED LEFT TO SPEND AND THIS IS SEVENTY FIVE 
WE'RE WITHIN BUDGET YES BUT LET'S PUT IT DOWN A BIT MORE 
SEE IF WE CAN GET IT FOR AROUND SIXTY FIVE 
SHALL WE HAVE A WORD WITH HIM LET'S DO IT LET'S GET THE BARGAIN

JAMES WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS THIS IS A VERY NICE BISCUIT BARREL 
I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S A BARREL

WE CAN SEE THE WEAR THAT'S NICKEL BELOW THAT 
IT'S REASSURING YOU WANT TO SEE A BIT OF WEAR 
I LIKE THE SPHINX HAD IT NOT HAD THAT SPHINX 
JUST AN ORDINARY KNOP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LITTLE OR NOTHING 
HOW OLD IS THE BARREL ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINETEEN TEN THAT OLD 
LOTS OF DIGS WERE BEING DONE AT PETRA AND THOSE SORT OF PLACES 
AND THE SPHINX WAS AN EMBLEMATIC A MYTHICAL BEAST 
IT HAD A HUMAN HEAD WITH A LION'S BODY 
SO INTELLIGENCE AND POWER 
HOW MUCH IS ON THE TICKET THIRTY FIVE 
WE'RE NEARLY OUT OF TIME YEAH 
AS OUR FINAL ITEM I WANT TO SEE A PROFIT 
AT THIRTY FIVE WE WON'T MAKE A PROFIT NEARER TWENTY WE HAVE A CHANCE MY TURN TO HAGGLE 
AND THOSE CAREFUL BREWERS DID GET IT DOWN TO TWENTY TWO ON THE NOSE 
THE HOUR IS UP TIME TO ROUND UP THOSE BREWERS LET'S HOPE THEY HAVEN'T SPENT ALL THE CASH 
JAMES AND CATHERINE TAKE THE LEFTOVER LOLLY AND SPEND IT ON A BONUS BUY TO BOOST THEIR PROFITS 
NICK AND RACHEL SPENT ONE HUNDRED ON TEN BLUE TILES 
THE WRONG COLOUR FOR THIS TEAM 
NICK DEFIED CATHERINE'S ADVICE ON THIS PHONE
