ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WORKERS GO ON STRIKE 
THE PROTEST HALTS ALL PRODUCTION AT 
THE REFINERY WHICH HANDLES MORE 
THAN ONE THIRD OF THE U. K.'S OIL 
SUPPLIES 
THIS IS SOMETHING WE SUPPLIES REALLY BELIEVE IN WE WILL FIGHT 
FOR OUR PENSIONS WE WILL DEFEND 
THEM TO THE END 
WE DON'T WANT TO 
BE OUT ON STRIKE NOBODY WANTS TO 
BE OUT ON STRIKE BUT HE IS NOT 
GIVING US ANY CHOICE 
THE MOMENT AFGHANISTAN'S PRESIDENT 
CAME CLOSE TO BEING ASSASSINATED 
PANIC AT THE MILITARY PARADE AS 
TALEBAN GUNMEN STRIKE IN THE HEART 
OF KABUL 
IN AUSTRIA THE MAN ACCUSED OF 
HOLDING HIS DAUGHTER CAPTIVE IN A 
CELLAR FOR FOUR YEARS 
AND LEWIS HAMILTON IS BACK ON THE 
PODIUM BUT FERRARI LEAD THE WAY IN 
THE SPANISH GRAND PRIX 
GOOD EVENING 
ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WORKERS AT THE GRANGEMOUTH 
OIL REFINERY HAVE BEGUN THEIR TWO 
DAY STRIKE IN DISPUTE OVER THEIR 
PENSIONS PRODUCTION IS NOW AT A 
STANDSTILL AT THE PLANT WHICH 
PROCESSES MORE THAN ONE OF THIRD OF 
THE U. K.'S OIL AND GAS 
WELL EXTRA SUPPLIES OF FUEL ARE 
BEING SHIPPED INTO SCOTLAND FROM 
EUROPE AND THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS 
THERE WILL BE NO SHORTAGES 
FROM GRANGEMOUTH HERE IS ANDREW 
CASSELL CASSELL IN AN ORDERLY AND SILENT PROCESSION 
THE NIGHT SHIFTWORKERS FILED OUT OF 
THE GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY AT DAWN 
MARKING THE FIRST SHUTDOWN OF THIS 
PLANT FOR MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS 
THEY'RE DETERMINED TO FIGHT WHAT 
THEY SEE AS AN UNWARRANTED ATTACK 
ON THEIR PENSION RIGHTS 
THIS IS 
SOMETHING WE REALLY BELIEVE IN WE 
ARE GOING TO 
OUR PENSIONS 
AND DEFEND THEM UNTIL THE END I I JUST THINK THAT THE COMPANY IS 
BEING A WEAH BIT UNREASONABLE WE 
COULD UNDERSTAND IF THINGS WERE BAD 
A WEE BIT UNREASONABLE 
WOE DON'T WANT TO BE OUT ON STRIKE 
BUT THEY DON'T GIVE US ANY CHANCE 
THE REFINERY'S OWNERS SAY THEY NEED 
TO ALTER THE PENSION PLANS FOR NEW 
WORKERS AS PART OF THE PLANS TO 
SAFEGUARD THE PLANT'S FUTURE THE THE PLANT NEEDS A HUGE INJECTION OF 
INVESTMENT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS 
OR SO WE ARE LOOKING AT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY 
MILLION WORTH OF INVESTMENT THE 
UNION ARE PUTTING THAT INVESTMENT 
AT RISK THROUGH THEIR ACTION AND 
ON THE BACK OF THAT INVESTMENT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY 
JOBS 
BUT THE SHUTDOWN AT JOBS GRANGEMOUTH HAS ALSO CLOSED THE 
PIPELINE BRINGING NEARLY HALF OF 
BRITAIN'S NORTH SEA OIL ASHORE 
THAT MEANS THE SUPPLY TO TANKERS 
LIKE THIS ONE MOORED ON THE FIRTH 
OF FORTH TODAY HAS BEEN DISRUPTED 
THREATENING EXPORT SALES WORTH FIFTY 
MILLION A DAY THE AUTHORITIES SAY 
THEY HAVE PREPARED CAREFULLY FOR 
THIS STRIKE THERE ARE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX 
FORECOURTS IN SCOTLAND 
THIS STRIKE THERE ARE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX FORECOURTS IN SCOTLAND 
THEY'RE 
SUPPLIED BY LORRIES FROM THREE MAIN 
DEPOTS INCLUDING GRANGEMOUTH 
FORECOURTS THAT RUN SHORT OF FUEL 
ARE BEING QUICKLY RESTOCKED TO TRY 
TO PREVENT SPANNIC BUYING AND EXTRA 
SUPPLIES ARE BEING SHIPPED IN FROM 
EUROPE 
EUROPE EUROPE TODAY THERE IS A WHOLE FLEET OF 
TANKERS COME FROM CONTINENTAL 
EUROPE AMSTERDAM AND GOTHENBURG TO 
ALLEVIATE ANY POSSIBLE SHORTAGES 
WHEN GRANGEMOUTH IS DOWN 
BUT ONCE 
THOSE SALES HAVE SALED UP THE RIVER 
FORTH TOTS REFINERY THEY STILL HAVE 
TO BE UNLOADED AT THE ADJACENT 
DOCKS WITH THE ONLY THING LEAVING 
GRANGEMOUTH DOCKS THIS AFTERNOON 
WAS A CARGO VESSEL IF THAT FLEET 
OF VESSELS CARRYING OIL FROM THE 
CONTINENT IS TO DOCK THE A 
GRANGEMOUTH THERE WILL NEED TO BE 
AN AGREEMENT WITH THE UNION AND 
GETTING THAT AGREEMENT WITH THE 
UNIONS WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT 
IN THIS INCREASINGLY BITTER DISPUTE 
LIVE NOW TO GRANGEMOUTH 
THE STRIKE WELL UNDER WAY WHAT ARE 
YOU PROSPECTS DO YOU THINK OF 
RESOLVING THIS 
I THINK IN SHORT 
NOT GOOD BOTH SIDES CONTINUE TO 
SAY THEY ARE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT IT 
THEY WANT TO GET BACK TO THE TABLE 
BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE VERY LITTLE 
SIGN OF THAT HAPPENING AND THE 
UNION HAS THREATENED TO ESCALATE 
THIS DISPUTE UNLESS THEY SAY THE 
COMPANY COMPROMISES ON ITS PENSION 
PROPOSALS TOMORROW THROUGHOUT ALL 
THE SCOTTISH NEWSPAPERS THERE WILL 
BE ADVERTS PLACED IN THOSE EDITIONS 
ON BEHALF OF THE WORKERS OF 
GRANGEMOUTH EXPLAINING THEY SAY 
TO THE PUBLIC DIRECTLY THEIR 
REASONS WHY THEY FELT THEY HAD TO 
TAKE STRIKE ACTION ASKING FOR THE 
UNDERSTANDING AND SYMPATHY OF THE 
SCOTTISH PUBLIC AND EXPRESSING 
REGRET AT ANY DIFFICULTIES THAT 
MOTORISTS AND OTHERS MIGHT HAVE IN 
TRYING TO GET HOLD OF FUEL BUT 
SIMPLY PUTTING THEIR CASE THEY 
FEEL IT IS THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN 
GET THEIR POINT ACROSS ABOUT HOW 
IMPORTANT THIS PENSION ISSUE IS TO 
THEM THEM AFGHANISTAN'S PRESIDENT HAMID 
KARZAI HAS ESCAPED WITH HIS LIFE 
AFTER TALEBAN GUNMEN ATTACKED A 
MILITARY PARADE IN THE HEART OF THE 
CAPITAL KAB THREE PEOPLE TWO 
MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WERE KILLED 
IN THE CAPITAL CONSTABLE 
BRITISH DIGNITARIES WERE AMONG 
PEOPLE ATTENDING THE CEREMONY WHEN 
THE SHOTS FIRED OUT 
A PRESIDENTAL MILITARY PARADE 
REMEMBERING AN HISTORICAL OF 
BEGUN VICTORY AND CELEBRATING THE 
STRENGTH OF THE NEW ARMY IN THE 
STADIUM A WHO'S WHO OF OF A BEGUN 
LEADERS PAST AND PRESENT FOREIGN 
AMBASSADORS COMMANDERS AND 
DIGNITARIES DIGNITARIES BUT AS THEY STOOD FOR THE NATIONAL 
ANTHEM AND THE TWENTY ONE GUN SALUTE THE 
ATTACKERS STRUCK 
BY THE TIME THE CAMERAS TURNED TO 
PRESIDENT KARZAI'S SEAT HE HAD 
ALREADY BEEN BUNDLED AWAY TO SAFETY 
BY HIS BODYGUARDS THE BRITISH 
AMBASSADOR WAS ALSO IN THE FRONT 
ROW HE DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED I I SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE A PUFF OF 
SMOKE AT THE SOUTHERN LEFT HAND END 
OF THE PARADE GROUND IN SOME 
DERELICT BUILDINGS THERE AND THEN 
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE CRACK OF 
SMALL ARMS FIRE GRADUALLY RISING 
AND I SAW THE PRESIDENT'S 
PROTECTIVE SECURITY DETAIL START TO 
DIRECT THEIR GUNS SOUTHWARDS AND 
OPEN FIRE 
AFGHAN NATIONAL TELEVISION CAPTURED 
LIVE THE MOMENT TWO MEMBERS OF 
PARLIAMENT WERE HIT AND OTHER V. I. P.'S 
DIVED FOR COVER THERE WAS PANIC ON 
THE PARADE GROUND WITHOUT 
AMMUNITION THE SOLDIERS 
UNCEREMONIOUSLY RAN FOR COVER 
WHAT BETTER IMAGE COULD THERE BE 
FOR TALEBAN PROPAGANDA THAN THIS 
WITHIN TWO HOURS THE PRESIDENT WAS 
BACK ON STATE TELEVISION WE 
KILLEDOR CAUGHT THEM HE SAID 
EVERYTHING IS NOW BACK TO NORMAL 
BUT THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED 
INCLUDING THIS TRIBAL ELDER AND 
TEN YEAR OLD BOY CAUGHT IN THE 
CROSSFIRE GRIEF AND MOURNING ON 
DAY THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT 
CELEBRATION CELEBRATION THE FACT THAT THE TALEBAN WERE ABLE 
TO DIRECTLY TARGET THE PRESIDENT 
AND SENIOR OF A BEGUN AND FOREIGN 
OFFICIALS RIGHT HERE IN THE HEART 
OF THE CAPITAL CITY AND LIVE ON 
NATIONAL TELEVISION IS NOT ONLY 
EMBARRASSING IT IS ALSO HUGELY 
WORRYING BOTH FOR THE AFGHAN 
GOVERNMENT AND FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WHO CLAIM 
TO BE BEATING THE INSURGENCY 
A SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD MAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED 
IN AUSTRIA ON SUSPICION OF KEEPING 
HIS DAUGHTER LOCKED IN CELLAR FOR 
TWENTY FOUR YEARS POLICE BELIEVE THE MAN 
FATHERED SEVEN CHILDREN WITH THE 
WOMAN WHO IS NOW FORTY TWO 
OUR CORRESPONDENT IS IN AMSTETTEN 
WHERE THE WOMAN IS SAID TO HAVE 
BEEN HELD A SHORT TIME AGO SHE 
REPORTED ON THE LATEST FROM THERE 
I'M STANDING HERE IN AMSTETTEN IN 
FRONT OF THE HOUSE WHERE POLICE SAY 
THESE PEOPLE WERE KEPT IN CAPTIVITY 
FOR ALL THESE YEARS NOW THE 
DAUGHTER ELISABETH F. IS SAID TO 
HAVE BEEN KEPT CAPTIVE IN THIS 
CELLAR SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND A NUMBER OF 
HER CHILDREN POLICE SAY SHE IS 
SUSPECTED OF HAVING BORNE AT LEAST 
SEVEN CHILDREN WITH HER FATHER 
THESE ARE THE ALLEGATIONS 
ACCORDING TO THE POLICE AND THAT 
THEY WERE KEPT IN THE CELLAR NOW 
FIRST OF ALL OF COURSE THE QUESTION 
OF THE D. N. A. TESTS IS PARAMOUNT BUT 
ALSO I THINK THEY WILL BE WANTING 
TO QUESTION ELISABETH F. AS THE 
VICTIM HAS BEEN NAMED SOME MORE 
SHE IS SAID TO BE IN AN EXTREMELY 
DELICATE DISTURBED MENTAL 
CONDITION AND THERE WILL BE MORE 
QUESTIONING OF HER AND ALSO 
QUESTIONING WE UNDERSTAND OF THE 
CHILDREN INVOLVED NOW WE 
UNDERSTAND THE FATHER HAS BEEN 
ARRESTED BUT POLICE SAY HE HAS NOT 
CONFESSED TO ANYTHING 
BETHANY BELL REPORTING FROM 
AMSTETTEN IN AUSTRIA 
BRITAIN'S BIGGEST FOUR SUPERMARKETS 
ARE FACING NEW INVESTIGATION BY 
THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING INTO 
ALLEGATIONS OF PRICE FIXING THE 
INVESTIGATION IS THOUGHT TO RELATE 
TO GROCERIES AS WELL AS HEALTH AND 
BEAUTY PRODUCTS ROBERT PESTON OUR 
BUSINESS EDITOR IS HERE WHAT 
APPEARS TO HAVE HAPPENED 
WELL LAST 
WEEK THE COMPETITION WATCHDOG 
REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM THE BIG 
FOUR SUPERMARKETS THOSE BEHIND US 
OVER THERE AND DID SO IN A RATHER 
SECRETIVE WAY IT HAS BEEN 
CATEGORISED AS SOMETHING OF A RAID 
ALTHOUGH IT DIDN'T SEEK A COURT 
ORDER IN THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION 
THIS IS PRETTY SERIOUS STUFF 
ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THE OFT CAN'T AT 
THIS STAGE PROVE ANY ILLEGAL OR 
WRONG DOING BUT IT WOULD NEVER GO 
ON A FISHING EXPEDITION IT WOULD 
ONLY GO IN IF IT THINK IT IS HAS 
EVIDENCE OF PRICE FIXING OF A SORT 
THAT SHOULDN'T GO ON 
EVEN IF NOT 
TECHNICALLY A RAID WORRYING FOR 
THE SUPERMARKETS 
YES IN THE LAST 
FEW MONTHS WE HAVE HAD THE OFFICE 
OF FAIR TRADING ACCUSING THEM OF 
RIGGING PRICES IN MILK COLLUDING 
IN THE SETTING OF PRICES IN TOBACCO 
SO THIS IS THE THIRD SET OF 
ALLEGATIONS OF THIS SORT NOW THE 
SUPERMARKETS HAVE ALL SAID THEY 
HAVEN'T BROKEN THE LAW THAT THEY 
WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO DAMAGE 
THE INTERESTS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS 
BUT THE STATISTICIANS WOULD SAY 
THREE IS A TREND AND THIS IS THE 
KIND OF TREND THAT WOULD PROBABLY 
WORRY THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND I'M 
AFRAID THEIR SHOPPERS 
NOW IT'S A CRUCIAL WEEK FOR GORDON 
BROWN WITH THE LOCAL ELECTIONS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES SET TO BE THE 
PRIME MINISTER'S FIRST ELECTORAL 
TEST THE TIMING IS FAR FROM IDEAL 
FROM HIM GIVEN CRITICISM OF HIS 
LEADERSHIP STYLE AND THE 
GOVERNMENT'S U. TURN ON THE TEN P. TAX 
RATE TODAY THOUGH MINISTERS HAVE 
BEEN RALLYING ROUND WITH WORDS OF 
SUPPORT FOR MR. BROWN AND A CALL FOR 
LABOUR UNITY 
GORDON BROWN IS FACING A CRITICAL 
WEEK HIS LEADERSHIP UNDER RENEWED 
PRESSURE FROM A MIXTURE OF POOR 
POLLS AND CRITICISM FROM SENIOR 
FIGURES WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY THE 
FORMER HOME SECRETARY CHARLES 
CLARKE RECENTLY SAID THE GOVERNMENT 
HAD MADE A SERIES OF POLICY 
MISTAKES TONY BLAIR'S CHIEF FUND 
RAISER LORD LEVY SAID HE BELIEVED 
THE PARTY WAS LACKING STRONG 
LEADERSHIP TODAY THOUGH A KEY 
ARCHITECT OF NEW LABOUR HAS SAID IT 
IS TIME TO RE FOCUS 
I THINK IF THE 
PARTY WERE TO REALLY UNITE AND 
RALLY AROUND HIM THAT WOULD MAKE A 
HUGE DIFFERENCE TO THE WAY IN WHICH 
THE PUBLIC IS SEEING THE GOVERNMENT 
AND THE PARTY AT THE MOMENT 
WITH JUST A FEW DAYS OF CAMPAIGNING 
LEFT THERE WAS MORE BAD NEWS IN 
THE POLLS 
AN I. C. M. POLL IN TODAY'S NEWS OF THE 
WORLD SUGGESTS A NINE PER CENT SWING TO THE 
CONSERVATIVES IN KEY MARGINAL SEATS 
IF A GENERAL ELECTION WERE TO BE 
HELD TOMORROW THE POLL IMPLIES THE 
CONSERVATIVES WOULD TAKE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
MARGINAL SEATS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
HANDING DAVID CAMERON SIXTY FOUR SEAT MAJORITY MAJORITY I I THINK WE ALWAYS KNEW THIS WAS I GOING TO BE A TOUGH YEAR IT IS A 
TOUGH YEAR BECAUSE IT IS THE MID 
TERM OF A THIRD TERM AND WE HAVE 
WOORLD ECONOMIC SITUATION THAT'S 
VERY VERY DIFFICULT INDEED A 
WORLD ECONOMIC SITUATION L. THINK 
IT IS AL TEST OF CHARACTER 
AS WELL AS A TEST OF POLICY THE THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER HAS SAID HE IS 
REACHING OUT TO TRADITIONAL LABOUR 
VOTERS WHO MIGHT BE DISILLUSIONED 
WITH GORDON BROWN 
I JUST FOCUS ON 
THE JOB WHICH IS GETTING THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY UNITED GETTING 
OUR POLICIES RIGHT PREPARING FOR 
GOVERNMENT TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE 
CAN REALLY OFFER PEOPLE A BETTER 
ALTERNATIVE 
HELLO HI I'M NICK ALTERNATIVE THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THEY 
HAVE BIG OPPORTUNITY AHEAD OF THEM 
PEOPLE CLEARLY ARE ANGRY WITH THEM THE GOVERNMENT AND THEY MAY GET 
ANGRIER BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS 
DETERIORATING THEY ARE LOOKING AT 
THE CONSERVATIVES INITIALLY AND 
ASKING IF THEY ARE A CREDIBLE 
GOVERNMENT I THINK THEY WILL FIND 
THEY ARE PRETTY FLAKY ON 
PARTICULARLY THE ECONOMY 
IF LABOUR 
PERFORMS BADLY ON THURSDAY'S LOCAL 
ELECTIONS THE GOVERNMENT WILL PUT 
IT DOWN TO MIDTERM BLUES BUT IF 
THEY LOSE LONDON IN THE MAYORAL 
ELECTION GORDON BROWN FACES THE 
PROSPECT OF RISING DISCONTENT ON 
HIS BACKBENCHES 
NOW THE LATEST ON THE OLYMPIC FLAME 
WHICH HAS ARRIVE IN THE NORTH 
KOREAN CAPITAL PYONGYANG EARLIER 
THE TORCH WAS PARADE THROUGH THE 
SOUTH KOREAN CAPITAL SEOUL WHERE 
CHINESE STUDENTS CLASHED WITH ANTI 
CHINA PROTESTERS 
NOW ON TO THE SPORT WITH OLLIE 
LEWIS HAMILTON WAS BACK ON THE 
PODIUM FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
WINNING THE AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX 
AT THE START OF THE FORMULA ONE 
SEASON HE WAS THIRD IN SPAIN TODAY 
FERRARI CONTINUED THEIR DOMINANCE 
WITH A ONE SLASH TWO FINISH KIMI 
RAIKKONEN TAKING THE CHECKERED FLAG 
THE BARCELONA TRACK HAS A 
REPUTATION FOR PRODUCING 
PROCESSIONAL RACES THAT WAS AGAIN 
THE CASE AFTER THE START HAD SORTED 
OUT THE WINNERS AND LOSERS THEER 
IF ARIES EMERGED IN FIRST AND 
SECOND WHILE LEWIS HAMILTON STOLE 
UP FROM FIFTH TO FOURTH WITH A 
SMART MANOEUVRE BUT FOR HIS 
MCLAREN TEAM MATE HEIKKI 
KOVALAINEN THE RACE WAS TO PROVE 
ANYTHING BUT STRAIGHTFORWARD 
SOMETHING GAVE WAY AT THE FRONT AND 
HE WAS SENT HURTLING INTO THE TYRE 
WALL AT ONE HUNDRED FORTY MILES AN HOUR SO DEEP 
WAS HIS CAR BURIED THERE WERE 
IMMEDIATE CONCERNS FOR HIS SAFETY 
BUT WHEN EMERGED ON A STRETCHER IT 
WAS CLEAR HE HAD A LUCKY ESCAPE 
SUFFERING LITTLE MORE THAN 
CONCUSSION CONCUSSION 
A THUMBS UP HAMILTON DID HIS BEST TO CHASE DOWN 
THEER IF ARIES WITHOUT THREATENING 
TO CATCH THEM REIGNING CHAMPION 
KIMI RAIKKONEN CAME HOME A 
COMFORTABLE WINNER TO EXTEND HIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP LEAD HAMILTON'S THIRD 
LIFTS HIM INTO SECOND PLACE BUT HE 
NEEDS TO FIND MORE SPEED FROM HIS 
CAR CAR TO FOOTBALL AND RANGERS HAVE 
TRIPPED UP AGAIN IN THEIR QUEST FOR 
A CLEAN SWEEP OF TROPHIES IN 
SCOTLAND THEY LOST THREE TO TWO TO CELTIC 
TO FALL FIVE POINTS BEHIND THEIR 
GREAT RIVALS IN THE LEAGUE ALTHOUGH 
THEY HAVE THREE GAMES IN HAND 
STILL FIGHTING FOR THE QUADRUPLE OF 
TROPHIES RANGERS KNEW A WIN AT 
CELTIC PARK WOULD CLINCH THE LEAGUE 
TITLE BUT THEY THOUGHT THAT ELEVEN 
DAYSS AGO AND LOST AND CELTIC WENT 
IN FRONT WITH SCOTT MCDONALD WHO 
MAY HAVE BEEN OFFSIDE RANGERS HAVE 
SO MANY GAMES IN HAND THEY COULD 
AFFORD TO LOSE AND STILL WIN THE 
LEAGUE BUT THAT THINKING DOESN'T 
APPLY TO OLD FIRM MAPS DAVID WEIR 
FOUND WAY THROUGH AND CELTIC WILL 
BE KICKING THEMSELVES THAT THEY 
LEFT THE SAME DOOR OPEN FOR DANIEL 
COUSIN COUSIN BUT BY HALF TIME THEY WERE LEVEL 
MCDONALD AGAIN 
THERE IS TO BE NO HAT TRICK FOR HIM 
BUT HE HAD A BIG SAY IN THE WINNER 
HE WAS HAULED DOWN AND BARRY ROBSON 
DID THE HONOURS 
IF RANGERS DO STUMBLE IN THE LEAGUE 
LEG OF THIS QUADRUPLE IT MAY BE 
BECAUSE OF A LACK OF PERSONNEL AS 
WELL AS POINTS STEPHEN WHITAKER'S 
LATE SENDING OFF MEANS HE WILL MISS 
KEY RANGERS' MATCHES IN THEIR RUN 
IN ALL IN ALL THE PERFECT RESULT 
FOR CELTIC 
THERE WERE TWO GAMES IN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE NO TITLE OR RELEGATION 
ISSUES AT STAKE THE BATTLE FOR 
FIFTH IN THE TABLE AND THAT UEFA
