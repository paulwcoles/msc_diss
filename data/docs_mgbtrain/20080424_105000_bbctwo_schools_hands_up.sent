HELLO MY NAME IS BARBARA 
DID YOU SEE THE RABBIT HOPPING ABOUT 
I HAVE A STORY ABOUT A RABBIT JUST LIKE HIM 
THERE WAS A GIRL CALLED ELLA 
ELLA'S DADDY HAD A RABBIT WHOSE FUR WAS GREY AND WHITE 
HIS FACE WAS GREY HIS MUZZLE WHITE AND HE HAD LONG WHISKERS 
ELLA'S FATHER WAS VERY PROUD OF THIS RABBIT 
BECAUSE HE HAD WON LOTS OF PRIZES IN MANY SHOWS 
DADDY PICKED UP THE RABBIT AND STROKED HIM 
ELLA WANTED TO STROKE HIM TOO 
BUT SHE KNEW SHE HAD TO ASK PERMISSION 
DADDY LET HER STROKE THE RABBIT 
AND THE RABBIT WRINKLED HIS NOSE AT ELLA AND BLINKED HIS BIG BROWN EYES 
ELLA THOUGHT HE WAS LOVELY 
THE NEXT DAY ELLA WOKE UP 
SHE GOT OUT OF BED AND OPENED HER CURTAINS 
OUTSIDE THE SKY WAS PINK AND FLUFFY 
JUST LIKE THE INSIDE OF THE RABBIT'S EARS 
ELLA WONDERED IF THE RABBIT WAS AWAKE YET 
SHE DECIDED TO SEE FOR HERSELF 
SHE QUICKLY DRESSED AND WENT OUT TO THE GARDEN SHED TO LOOK AT HIM 
WHEN SHE REACHED THE SHED DOOR SHE HESITATED 
SHE KNEW SHE SHOULD ASK PERMISSION FROM HER DADDY 
HE WAS ASLEEP AND SHE SHOULDN'T WAKE HIM 
SHE ONLY WANTED A QUICK LOOK AT THE RABBIT THAT WASN'T NAUGHTY WAS IT 
SHE OPENED THE DOOR 
THE RABBIT LIVED IN A HUTCH IN THE GARDEN SHED 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN 
THE RABBIT WAS ASLEEP BUT WHEN HE HEARD ELLA APPROACHING 
HE PRICKED UP HIS EARS AND WRINKLED HIS VELVETY NOSE 
ELLA STROKED HIS NOSE THROUGH THE METAL GRILL WITH HER FINGERTIPS 
SHE WANTED TO GIVE HIM A PROPER STROKE 
SURELY IT WOULDN'T BE NAUGHTY TO OPEN THE DOOR JUST A TINY BIT 
SHE OPENED THE DOOR 
THE RABBIT WHIZZED OUT OF THE HUTCH AND OUT OF THE SHED 
OH NO CRIED ELLA 
IF DADDY FINDS OUT THE RABBIT'S MISSING HE'LL BE CROSS 
I MUST CATCH THE RABBIT QUICKLY 
THE RABBIT HAPPILY HOPPED ACROSS THE LAWN 
HE STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE LAWN MOWER 
AND NIBBLED A DELICIOUS DANDELION LEAF 
ELLA SAW THE RABBIT AND CREPT ACROSS THE LAWN AND REACHED OUT TO GRAB HIM 
BUT THE RABBIT SQUIRMED OUT OF ELLA'S HANDS AND JUMPED OVER THE LAWN MOWER 
THE RABBIT HOPPED ACROSS SOME PLANT POTS KNOCKING THEM OVER 
SPILLING THE SOIL EVERYWHERE 
THEN HE HOPPED ONTO THE WHEELBARROW 
AND AS ELLA APPROACHED HE HOPPED OFF 
BY NOW THE SUN WAS HIGH AND GOLDEN 
ELLA KNEW THAT SOON HER DADDY WOULD WAKE UP AND COME TO FEED THE RABBIT 
SHE HAD TO CATCH HIM QUICKLY 
THE RABBIT HOPPED ALONG AND ONTO THE FLOWERBEDS 
ELLA RACED AFTER HIM 
ROUND AND ROUND THE FLOWERBEDS RAN THE RABBIT 
AND ROUND AND ROUND RAN ELLA 
THE RABBIT TRAMPLED ON THE FLOWERS ELLA TRAMPLED ON THE FLOWERS 
SOON ALL THE FLOWERS WERE SQUASHED 
THERE WERE SOME STEPS LEADING DOWN TO THE FENCE 
AND ALONG THE STEPS WERE SOME STRAWBERRIES 
COVERING THE STRAWBERRIES WAS A NET 
ELLA SAW THE NET AND HAD AN IDEA 
PERHAPS SHE COULD USE THE NET TO CATCH THE RABBIT 
SHE PICKED UP THE NET AND TRIED TO THROW IT OVER THE RABBIT 
BUT INSTEAD SHE THREW IT OVER HERSELF SHE WAS ALL TANGLED UP 
MEANWHILE THE RABBIT SAT DOWN TO HAVE A GOOD SCRATCH 
HE LOOKED BACK AT ELLA WITH AMUSEMENT 
HE THEN HIP HOPPED DOWN THE GARDEN STEPS AND SQUEEZED UNDER THE FENCE 
ELLA UNTANGLED HERSELF FROM THE NET 
AND SAW THE RABBIT DISAPPEAR WITH HORROR 
SHE HAD TO CATCH HIM SOMEHOW AS NOW IT WAS TIME FOR DADDY TO WAKE UP 
IN THE HOUSE DADDY'S ALARM CLOCK JINGLED AND JANGLED 
HE SLOWLY WOKE UP 
I MUST FEED THE RABBIT HE THOUGHT AND GOT OUT OF BED 
ELLA PEERED THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FENCE 
IN THE FIELD THE RABBIT SAT AND SCRATCHED 
BUT THEN FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE 
HE SAW AN ENORMOUS CAT LOOKING AT HIM 
THE CAT LICKED HIS LIPS AND MENACINGLY WAVED HIS TAIL 
THE RABBIT WAS TERRIFIED 
HE BOLTED UNDER THE FENCE UP THE STEPS ALONG THE FLOWERBED 
ONTO THE WHEELBARROW OVER THE LAWN MOWER ACROSS THE LAWN 
INTO THE SHED AND INTO HIS HUTCH 
ELLA RACED AFTER HIM 
AND SLAMMED THE HUTCH DOOR CLOSED 
SHE WAS SO RELIEVED THE RABBIT WAS SAFE 
JUST THEN SHE HEARD HER DADDY COMING 
HELLO DADDY
