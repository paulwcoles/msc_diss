IT IS FRIDAY IT IS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY IT IS 
WORKING LUNCH WITH ADDED VALUE 
MEANING IT IS THE SAME PROGRAMME AS 
NORMAL BUT TWICE THE LENGTH 
GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO WORKING 
LUNCH BYE BYE TO THE TEN PER CENT INCOME 
TAX RATE WILL THE GOVERNMENT HELP 
THE TAXPAYERS TAXPAYERS WHO ARE 
LOSING OUT AND WHO HAVE BEEN 
COMPLAINING TO US 
ALSO POWERING UP ARE BRITISH ENERGY 
I'M PADDY O'CONNELL 
RACHEL IS FINDING OUT HOW DO YOU 
RUN A MICHELIN STARRED RESTAURANT 
IN ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE PARTS OF 
THE U. K. 
ALSO WE WILL BE KEEPING THINGS IN 
THE FAMILY TALKING FAMILY 
BUSINESSES AND WE WILL TRY TO 
ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ON SAVINGS 
AND WHEN YOU CALL A COMPANY THESE 
THE SECRETARIAL SERVICES ARE 
BECOMING COMMON 
I HAVE COMING TO A FIRM IN WREXHAM 
TO FIND OUT HOW IT WORKS 
LABOUR M. P.'S SEEM TO HAVE FORCED THE 
GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT 
THE IMPACT OF THE ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN PER CENT TAX RATE 
YOU HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING TO US FOR 
MONTHS THAT SOME LOW INCOME WORKERS 
WILL LOSE MONEY AND LAST NIGHT AN 
EARLY DAY MOTION SUPPORTED BY 
DOZENS OF THE M. P.'S WAS WITHDRAWN 
AFTER MINISTERS GAVE ASSURANCES 
THAT THEY WOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK 
AT THE ISSUE 
IT WAS THE BIG GRIEVANCE FOR WHICH 
NO REMEDY WAS OFFERED IN THE BUDGET 
BOX LAST MONTH THE CHANCELLOR 
STOOD BY GORDON BROWN'S AXING OF 
THE TEN PER CENT RATE WHICH WENT IN ORDER TO 
FINANCE A REDUCTION IN THE BASIC 
RATE FROM TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY PER CENT 
THE LOSERS FROM THE ABOLITION OF 
THE TEN PER CENT INCOME TAX BAND WILL BE 
WOMEN AGED SIXTY TO SIXTY FOUR WHO DON'T GET A 
HIGHER TAX ALLOWANCE FOR PENSIONERS 
ALSO UNDER TWENTY FIVES GOING FOR THEIR 
FIRST JOBS STUDENTS WORKING IN THE 
EVENINGS AND HOLIDAYS LOW INCOME 
MIGRANTS AND MANY PART TIME WORKERS 
GROUPS WHO DON'T BENEFIT FROM A 
HIKE IN WORKING TAX CREDIT WHICH 
WAS DESIGNED TO SOFTEN THE BLOW 
INSTEAD OF PAYING TEN PER CENT ON INCOMES 
ABOVE THEIR TAX FREE PERSONAL 
ALLOWANCES THE PEOPLE AFFECTED 
WILL START PAYING TAX AT TWENTY PER CENT THAT 
COULD MEAN AROUND TWO HUNDRED POUNDS MORE 
IN TAX PER YEAR 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ANGRY ABOUT 
THIS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ANGRY THIS JUST TO GIVE YOU A FLAVOUR SUSAN 
TOLD US SHE IS A FEMALE PENSIONER 
UNDER SIXTY FIVE WHO WILL BE OVER OVER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY 
WORSE OFF 
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE TWENTY EIGHT M. P.'S WHO 
SIGNED THE EARLY DAY MOTION AROUND 
ONE HUNDRED COULD HAVE DONE IF IT HAD GONE 
THROUGH AND THEY WERE STRONG ARMED 
INTO WITHDRAWING IT BUT MINISTERS 
SAID WE WILL LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF 
IT EVEN THOUGH IT IS COMING ON 
SUNDAY 
THAT WAS THE DEAL DONE SUNDAY BEHIND THE SCENES THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS TO STEP DOWN AND SAY WE WON'T 
DO IT WHAT COULD THEY DO TO SOFTEN 
THE IMPACT 
I DON'T THINK YOU 
SHOULD EXPECT A U. TURN IF THAT WAS 
GOING TO HAPPEN IT WOULD HAVE 
HAPPENED IN THE BUDGET WHAT THE 
M. P.'S ARE LOOKING FOR IS FOR INSTANCE 
ONE OF THEM SUGGESTED TO ME A 
MANIPULATION OF THE TAX CREDIT 
SYSTEM WHICH 
DOES 
ALLEVIATE THE 
SYSTEM WHICH DOES ALLEVIATE THE SITUATION FOR SOME PEOPLE TO BRING 
IN MORE GROUPS THAT GET AN 
INCREASED TAX CREDIT A. R. ALLOW MORE 
PEOPLE TO COME INTO THE TAX CREDIT 
SYSTEM YOU CAN'T GET WORKING TAX 
CREDIT IF YOU ARE TWENTY FIVE OR UNDER OR 
IF YOU ARE WORKING LESS THAN THIRTY 
HOURS A WEEK UNLESS YOU ARE A 
PARENT SO THERE ARE LOTS OF GROUPS 
THAT GET MISSED OUT 
THERE IS ANOTHER SUGGESTION I HEARD 
TODAY FROM THE LOW INCOMES TAX 
REFORM GROUP ROBIN WILLIAMSON 
POINTED OUT SOME PEOPLE CAN BENEFIT 
FROM THE TEN PER CENT RATE ON THEIR SAVINGS 
THIS IS HOW HE EXPLAINED IT 
THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T ENTIRELY 
ABOLISHED THE TEN PER CENT RATE THEY HAVE 
LEFT BEHIND A TEN PER CENT RATE ON SAVINGS 
WHICH IS 
LIMITED TO THE FIRST TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY 
WHICH IS LIMITED TO THE FIRST TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY OF TAXABLE INCOME ABOVE THE 
PERSONAL ALLOWANCE 
SO THAT IT ONLY APPLIES TO PEOPLE 
ON THAT SORT OF INCOME RANGE SEVEN THOUSAND 
TO EIGHT THOUSAND YEAR 
THE BULK OF WHOSE INCOME IS FROM 
SAVINGS NOW IF YOU TOOK THAT AND 
YOU MADE IT A GENERAL RELIEF YOU 
GOT YOU HAD THE STARTING RATE ON 
ALL TYPES OF INCOME UP TO THAT 
LIMIT THEN YOU WOULD HELP THE 
PEOPLE WHO AT THE MOMENT ARE WORST 
HIT BY THIS CHANGE 
SO WHAT HE IS SAYING IS WE ARE 
PRESERVING THE TEN PER CENT RATE FOR PEOPLE 
PEOPLE ON THEIR SAVINGS INCOME WHY 
NOT WIDEN THAT FOR LOW INCOME 
EARNERS AND KEEP THE LOW RATE FOR 
THEM MINISTERS WILL BE LOOKING AT 
OTHER POCKETS IN THE 
POSSIBILITIES BUT IT WOULD BE TOO 
OPTIMISTIC TO HOPE FOR A U. TURN 
THAT THEY WOULD BRING BACK THE TEN PER CENT 
RATE RATE SO TO THE OTHER BUSINESS NEWS THE 
SLOWDOWN IN THE PROPERTY MARKET 
MAYBE MUCH WORSE THAN SOME ARE 
SAYING ONE IN FIVE HOUSES PUT ON 
THE MARKET SINCE AUGUST LAST YEAR 
HAS BEEN SOLD THIS IS ALL CLAIM 
FROM PRIMEMOVE 
NEARLY THREE OUT OF FOUR SO CALLED 
MIDDLE INCOME INCOME HOUSEHOLDS 
PLAN TO CUT THEIR SPENDING SO SAYS 
ANOTHER SURVEY BY THE FINANCIAL 
SERVICES COMPANY AXEIA THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH MEANS SOME ARE REDUCING 
THEIR PENSION PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS 
KISS OR SHAKE IT IS THE MODERN 
WORKPLACE DILEMMA ACCORDING TO THE 
RECRUITMENT FIRM OFFICE ANGELS IT 
CLAIMS WORKERS FACE A PROBLEM EVERY 
TIME THEY GREET A CLIENT OR 
COLLEAGUE WHETHER TO SHAKE THEIR 
HAND MAYBE APPEAR COLD AND ALOOF 
OR KISS AND RISK AN EMBARRASSING 
GROPE OR CLASH OF CHEEKS ONE IN 
FIVE CLAIM TO HAVE CLASHED FACES 
ONE IN TEN WERE SO FLUSTERED THEY 
ENDED UP WAVING LIKE AN IDIOT 
HELLO HELLO AT THE END OF THIS WEEK NEW LAWS 
ON CORPORATE MANSLAUGHTER WILL COME 
INTO EFFECT THE CHANGES ARE INTEND 
TODAY MAKE IT EASIER TO TO HOLD A 
COMPANY ACCOUNTABLE FOR DEATHS IN 
THE WORKPLACE TO TELL US MORE WE 
ARE JOINED BY SAFETY ADVISOR AT 
THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE 
PREVENTION OF ACCIDENTS 
PERHAPS BEFORE WE LOOK AT CHANGES 
YOU CAN TELL US WITH YOUR 
EXPERIENCE WHAT CASES HIGHLIGHT FOR 
YOU THE NEED FOR SOME CHANGE NAME 
STORIES FROM THE PAST THAT WE CAN 
RECALL 
I THINK PROBABLY THE MOST RECALL INFAMOUS CASE WAS THE HERALD OF 
FREE ENTERPRISE YOU RECALL THE 
DISASTER LED TO AN INQUIRY LED BY 
LORD JUSTICE SHEEN WHO DESCRIBED 
P. AND AMP O. AS A CULTURE OF SOPINESS FROM 
TOP TO SLOPPINESS FROM TOP TO 
BOTTOM WHEN WE WERE PROSECUTED FOR 
THE CRIME OF MANSLAUGHTER THE CASE 
WAS THROWN OUT BECAUSE OF THE 
PROBLEM OF IDENTIFYING A 
CONTROLLING MIND IN THE 
ORGANISATION THAT EXEMPLIFIED THE 
COMPANY BECAUSE IT WAS THE COMPANY 
THAT WAS ON TRIAL FOR THE CRIME OF 
MANSLAUGHTER SO IT IT IS REALLY TO 
CORRECT THIS GAP IN JUSTICE THAT 
VICTIMS ORGANISATIONS SAFETY 
ORGANISATIONS HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING 
FOR TEN YEARS NOW TO GET THE LAW 
CHANGED AND THAT CHANGE THE LAW 
TAKES EFFECT FROM SUNDAY 
WHERE THERE HAS BEEN DEATHS 
ASSOCIATED WITH ORGANISATIONS THAT 
FAILED AND FAILED MISERABLY TO 
PROTECT PEOPLE AND TO PROTECT THEIR 
LIVES THEN IT IS LIKELY THAT 
BESIDES HEALTH AND SAFETY 
PROSECUTIONS THEY MAY FACE 
PROSECUTION FOR THE CRIME OF 
MANSLAUGHTER MANSLAUGHTER OF COURSE YOU ARE PUTTING IT VERY 
STRONGLY THERE BECAUSE JUST TO 
REMEMBER THAT WAS FERRY THAT SET 
SAIL WITH ITS DOORS OPEN INDEED INDEED AND THE DIFFICULTY WAS SHOWING THAT 
THE BOARD OF COMPANY WHICH THE 
INQUIRY SHOWED TOOK LITTLE INTEREST 
IN SAFETY THAT THE BOARD WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
EXISTING AT THE TIME 
ROGER YOU USED FASCINATING 
PHRASE I THINK OUR WORKING LUNCH 
REGULAR WILL WANT YOU TO TELL US 
WHAT IT MEANS THE CONTROLLING MIND 
AND IT SUGGESTS TO ME AT LEAST IT 
IS EASIER TO FIND CONTROLLING 
MIND IN SMALLER ORGANISATION THAN 
A GREAT BIG BUMBLING BUREAUCRACY 
INDEED IT IS AND THE INJUSTICE IN 
THIS SITUATION IS THAT IT HAS BEEN 
SMALLER ORGANISATIONS THAT HAVE 
BEEN CAPABLE OF BEING PROSECUTED 
FOR THE CRIME OF MANSLAUGHTER 
LARGELY BECAUSE THOSE WHO WERE 
DIRECTING AFFAIRS IN THE COMPANY 
WERE MORE OR LESS DIRECTING 
ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONS AT FIRST 
HAND HAND WHEREAS IT HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT 
TO SHOW THAT IN PROSECUTING LARGE 
ORGANISATIONS WHICH HAVE FAILED AND 
FAILED BADLY TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND 
THAT FAILURE LED TO PEOPLE'S DEATHS 
SO THE NEW ACT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT 
WHEN ASSESSING THE GUILT OF AN 
ORGANISATION ALTHOUGH IT WON'T BE 
DIRECTORS WHO WILL BE PROSECUTED 
IT WILL BE THE BEHAVIOUR OF 
DIRECTORS AND SENIOR MANAGERS IT 
WILL BE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY 
ARRANGEMENTS IN THE COMPANY IT 
WILL BE THE CULTURE OF SAFETY IN 
THE COMPANY THAT WILL BE ON TRIAL 
VERY INTERESTING 
YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR VIEWERS WILL 
KNOW THERE ARE MANY WELL RUN 
COMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY WE ALWAYS 
CONCENTRATE ON BAD AND YOU HAVE 
HIGHLIGHTED WHY WE CAN AND SHOULD 
BUT WHAT ARE TIPS FOR ALREADY WELL 
RUN BUSINESSES TO DOCK THE DOT 
THE IS AND CROSS THE T.'S 
I DON'T THINK THE WELL COMPANIES 
HAVE MUCH TO FEAR FROM THE THIS LAW 
AT ALL REMEMBER THIS IS GOING TO 
BE RESERVED FOR CASES WHERE 
STANDARDS HAVE FALLEN FAR BELOW 
WHAT MIGHT BE REASONABLY EXPECTED 
EXPECTED THE WELL RUN COMPANY 
WHICH HAS GOOD HEALTH AND SAFETY 
POLICY THAT HAS PROPER BOARD LEVEL 
GOVERNANCE OF SAFETY AND THERE IS 
SOME NEW HEALTH AND SAFETY 
EXECUTIVE AND GUIDANCE WHICH HELPS 
US THERE THOSE COMPANIES HAVE 
LITTLE TO FEAR IT IS THE COMPANIES 
WHERE BOARDS HAVE A CAVALIER FOR 
SEMI DETACHED ATTITUDE TO SAFETY 
THEY ARE THE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO 
CHECK OUT THE ARRANGEMENTS AND MAKE 
SURE THAT WHEN THESE CASES ARISE 
THEY CAN SHOW A PATTERN OF DILL 
AGAINST AGAINST ROGER DILIGENCE 
ROGER THANK YOU FOR COMING TO 
WORKING LUNCH AND COME AGAIN 
THANK YOU 
IS THERE ANY RISK TO OUR WELLBEING 
ADAM HAS THE MARKETS 
ADAM HAS THE MARKETS YES THAT'S IT THERE IS ALWAYS 
RISK THE MARKET WASN'T DOING TOO 
BADLY AND THE REASON THAT THE 
MARKET ISN'T DOING TOO BADLY RUM 
RUMOUR THAT BRITISH ENERGY IS 
FACING A POSSIBLE TAKE OVER 
BIGGER BLOCKS BIGGER MOVES BLUE 
SHOWS THEY ARE UP IF WE ZOOM IN 
SEVEN HUNDRED SIX UP FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE PENCE 
SEVEN HUNDRED SIX IS WHERE IT IS HEADING NOW 
THE FIFTY TWO WEEK HIGH THE YEAR HIGH 
SEVEN HUNDRED TEN SEVEN HUNDRED TEN LOOK AT THE LOW FORTY WHAT RANGE 
FOR THAT SHARE TO HAVE GONE THROUGH 
THAT'S BRITISH ENERGY UP ON RUMOURS 
OF A TAKE OVER 
IT 
LOOK LIKE A MIXED DAY 
MAYBE I WAS WRONG ABOUT THE F. T. S. E. 
ONE HUNDRED EVEN IF IT IS UP IT IS BEING 
PULLED IN TWO DIRECTIONS B. A. DOWN TWO 
AND MARKS AND AMP SPENCER'S DOWN SIX 
MORE ON DRINKS LATER 
ELSEWHERE PARK THE CHRISTMAS 
HAMPER GROUP HAS SEEN ORDERS RISE 
THIS YEAR AS THEY SAY CONFIDENCE IN 
THE HAMPER MARKET RECOVERS AFTER 
THE FARE PACK COLLAPSE ORDERS FOR 
CHRISTMAS TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ARE SEVENTEEN PER CENT ABOVE THE 
VALUE ACHIEVED AT THE SAME DATE 
LAST YEAR THEIR SHARES 
UNCHANGEDMENT HERE ARE SOME OF THE 
OTHER MOVERS 
THE F. T. S. E. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THE SMALLER COMPANIES 
THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING DOWN 
GENERALLY NOT TOO BAD DAY MADE 
EVEN BETTER BY THE FACT THAT ANDY 
BROUGH HAS JOINED ME FROM SCHRODERS 
YOU WERE CHECKING YOUR MOBILE PHONE 
AND TO SEE WHAT THE MARKETS WERE 
DOING SECONDS BEFORE WE WERE ON 
AIR 
AIR 
YOU HAD THE F. T. S. E. UP THIRTY YET THE 
F. T. S. E. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOWN FIFTY FOUR THE LAST SEVEN 
SESSIONS THE F. T. S. E. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WHERE I 
SPECIALISE IN HAS BEEN UP MORE 
THAN TEN PER CENT IN TOTAL WE HAVE SEEN A 
BIG RALLY IN THE MARKETS YOU LOOK 
BACK WE ARE COMING INTO THE SECOND 
QUARTER NOW AND THE FIRST QUARTER 
WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE L. STARTED 
THE FIRST QUARTER WITH A FULL HEAD 
OF HAIR THE NATIONALISATION OF 
NORTHERN ROCK BEAR STEARNS 
COLLAPSING THE CREDIT MARKETS 
DRYING UP 
WE LOOK AT THE F. T. S. E. AS 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE BUT ARE YOU 
SAYING THAT THE F. T. S. E. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THEY'RE 
STILL BIG COMPANIES BUT NOT THE 
ONE HUNDRED BIGGEST IS THAT WHERE THE 
PROFIT IS 
IT'S INTERESTING THE 
F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IF YOU PUT ONE HUNDRED IN THE 
F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IN DECEMBER NINETY NINTH WOULD YOU 
HAVE LOST FIFTEEN PER CENT OF YOUR MONEY SINCE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE 
YES AT THE END OF NINETY NINE IT NINETEEN NINETY NINE WAS SEVEN THOUSAND NOW IT'S BELOW SIX THOUSAND 
YOU KNOW EQUITIES ARE ABOUT 
INVESTING YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO 
COLLECT THEM BECAUSE INTEREST 
RATES CHANGE COMPANIES CHANGE 
YOUR PORTFOLIO HAS TO CHANGE DO DO YOU THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
THE CASE 
YEAH I DO IF YOU LOOK 
AT THE BIG FOUR ENTRIES IN THE F. T. S. E. 
ONE HUNDRED THE BANKS THE MINERS AND THE 
PHARMACEUTICALS AND THE TELECOMS 
IT'S 
GET ALL FOUR 
PISTEONS MOVING IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION WHILE MINING SHARES HAVE 
BEEN PHENOMENAL IT'S PETE TONG FOR 
THE BANKS 
WHERE IS THE STRENGTH 
COMING IN THE F. T. S. E. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THE THE STRENGTHS IN THE F. T. S. E. FIFTY YOU HAVE 
DINE ANIC NEW INDUSTRIES IN NINETY NINE 
OIL HIT A HIGH OF TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS A BARREL 
IT'S REFLECTING WHAT IS GOING ON 
SINCE NINETY NINE THERE'S ONLY ABOUT SEVENTY 
STOCKS OUT OF THE ORIGINAL TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THAT 
ARE HERE NOW YOU GET A RAPID 
CHANGE YOU GET NEW COMPANIES 
COMING IN WE CALL IT THE HEINEKEN 
INDEX BECAUSE IT GETS REFRESHED 
LIKE NO OTHER ONE 
LET'S LOOK AT THE NEW MOVERS OF THE 
WEEK WEEK BACK TO THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED 
THERE'S THE STRENGTH OVER THE WEEK 
CARE TO COMMENT 
ASTROACCIDENT KA 
YOU KNOW I WAS LOOKING AT THIS 
AND THE DRUG SECTOR HAS BEEN A 
TERRIBLE PLACE TO BE FIRST OF ALL 
THEY HAD THE WEAKNESS OF THE DOLLAR 
THEN SOCIETY HAS DECIDED THAT IT 
WANTS TO LIVE LONGER BUT PAY LESS 
FOR DRUGS IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE 
HOW THAT DYNAMIC MAINTAINS 
IF AST RA DOESN'T FIND MANY DRUGS 
IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO BE 
DRUG SECTORS ARE ALWAYS ASSOCIATED 
WITH HIGH GROWTH BUT FIVE BROKERS 
SAY THAT ASTRA IS TOO CHEAP 
SO SHARES ARE UP FOURTEEN PER CENT 
ELSEWHERE WE 
HAVE INTERNATIONAL POWER AND 
ANTAGANASTA THOSE ARE THE MINERS 
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT ENERGY ASSETS 
ARE VERY VERY ATTRACTIVE FOR 
PEOPLE TO BUY IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE 
THE OIL PRICE WILL FALL MUCH THERE 
IS A SCARCITY OF ENERGY IN A LOT OF 
PLACES THESE STOCKS ARE ATTRACTIVE 
FRIENDS PROVIDENT THE BID FOR J. C. 
FLOWERS HE HAS TO PUT UP OR SHUT 
UP BY THE THIRTIETH APRIL 
LET'S LOOK AT 
THE DOWNSIDE POOR OLD I. T. V. NOTHING 
ON T. V. 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SMILING 
SO MUCH WHEN YOU SAY THAT 
OBVIOUSLY IT'S VERY VERY HARD THE 
FRAGMENTATION OF MEDIA MAKES IT 
VERY HARD FOR MICHAEL GRADE TO GET 
A BIG ENOUGH AUDIENCE FOR THE 
ADVERTISERS TO PAY A PREMIUM RATE 
MY RETICENCE ABOUT TALKING ABOUT IT 
I NEVER KNOW WHEN I MIGHT NEED A 
JOB THE I. T. V. IT'S NOT THAT 
COMPETITIVE MARKET I. T. V. IS THE 
MAJOR PLAYER IN INDEPENDENT 
TELEVISION WHAT IS THE PROBLEM IF 
YOU WANT TO ADVERTISE YOU HAVE TO 
ADVERTISE THERE 
IT'S INTERESTING 
I ASKED MY KIDS LAST NIGHT SAID 
WHAT'S ON T. V. THEY CALLED IT 
BUT NOW KIDS SPEND MORE TIME ON THE 
INTERNET 
MUCH MORE FROM YOU INTERNET INCLUDING ANOTHER JOKE I HOPE 
IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THAT THE 
B. B. C. GETS ALL OF THIS MONEY FROM THE 
PUBLIC IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S 
COMMERCIALY GETTING THE MONEY IN 
THE SAME WAY SO I. T. V. PEOPLE WILL BE 
WATCHING SAYING DON'T FORGET THAT 
I WANTED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION YOU 
USED THE P. E. PHRASE CAN YOU JARGON 
BUST FOR US ANDY 
P. E. I USE THE P. E. PHRASE BECAUSE IT 
WAS SOMETHING I WAS GOOD AT IN 
SCHOOL P. E. IS THE PRICE EARNINGS 
RATIO YOU TAKE THE EARNINGS OF THE 
COMPANY AFTER TAX EARNINGS AND 
DIVIDE IT BIT NUMBER OF SHARES AND 
LOOK AT THE SHARE PRICE AND DIVIDE 
IT BY THE ACTUAL SHARE PRICE YOU 
COMPARE THE VARIOUS SHARES OF THE 
MARKET 
A VALUE FACTOR YES MARKET YES NOW IF WE THINK OF OUTSOURCE YOU 
MIGHT THINK OF CALL CENTRES IN 
INDIA BUT OUTSOURCED JOBS CAN ALSO 
BE KEPT HERE IN THE U. K. ROB HAS 
BEEN TO VISIT ONE COMPANY WHO 
PROVIDE VIRTUAL RECEPTIONISTS TO 
ASK WHAT ON EARTH ARE THEY TALKING 
ABOUT ABOUT WHEN YOU VISIT AS MANY INDUSTRIAL 
ESTATES AND COMPANIES AS I DO YOU 
GET USED TO SITES LIKE THIS YOU 
ARRIVE AT RECEPTION SOMEWHERE AND 
THERE'S NOBODY HERE IN FACT THIS 
IS MORE THAN YOU GET THESE DAYS 
THERE'S A LITTLE BELL IN THE CORNER 
THE PERSON MIGHT NOT BE INSIDE 
THEY MIGHT BE SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE 
COUNTRY OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE 
WORLD IN THIS CAKE I KNOW THEY'RE 
NEXT DOOR I HAVE COME ALONG TO 
THIS FIRM IN WREXHAM WHICH MAKES A 
LIVING OUT OF DOING THAT 
GOOD AFTERNOON MONEYPENNY HOW MAY 
I HELP YOU 
THE COMPANY CALLED APPROPRIATELY 
ENOUGH MONEYPENNY PROVIDE 
SECRETARIAL AND P. A. SERVICES FOR 
THREE THOUSAND FIRMS AROUND THE COUNTRY IT 
WAS SET UP BY BROTHER AND SISTER ED 
REEVES AND RACHEL CLACHER IT GREW 
OUT OF AN ORDER MISSED BY ED WHEN 
HE WAS RUNNING HIS OWN BUSINESS A 
CLIENT TRIED TO SEND A FAX WHEN HE 
WAS OUT OF THE OFFICE AND THE FAX 
MACHINE HAD RUN OUT OF PAPER AT AT THE TIME THE PERSON IN THE MESSAGE 
CENTRE TURNED AROUND AND SAID WHAT 
CAN I DO I'M ONLY A MESSAGE CENTRE 
I LOST THE CLIENT RACHEL AND I GOT 
TOGETHER AND THOUGHT THIS WAS MAD 
THERE'S NO REASON WHY THAT PERSON 
CAN'T BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW THAT 
BUSINESS CALL COULD HAVE BEEN 
HANDLED 
WHAT DO PEOPLE DO HANDLED ESSENTIALLY CLIENTS' CALLS GET 
DIVERTED TO US WHEN THEIR CALLS 
MIGHT BE BUSY THE CALL COMES 
THROUGH HERE AND IS ROOTED DIRECTLY 
TO THAT CLIENT'S OWN RECEPTIONIST 
SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS THE BUSINESS AND 
HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE 
SHE IS HANDLING SHE CAN ANSWER THE 
CALL THE CALLER HAS NO IDEA THAT 
THE CALL IS NOT BEING ANSWERED 
WITHIN THE CLIENT'S OFFICE WE CAN 
HANDLE THE CALL AS THE INHOUSE 
RECEPTIONIST WOULD WE CAN PUT 
CALLS THROUGH TO MOBILE PHONES AND 
SEND TEXT MESSAGES 
THE COMPANY NOW 
HAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE STAFF ACTS AS 
RECEPTIONISTS AND PICKING UP PHONE 
CALLS FOR FIRMS AROUND THE COUNTRY 
IT'S A JOB AND A BUSINESS THAT HAS 
MADE POSSIBLE BY NEW TECHNOLOGY IT IT SAVED MY LIFE SO MANY TIMES IT'S 
PERFECT IT ALLOWS ME TO DO WHAT I 
DO MAKES IT FLOW MAKES ME SOUND 
MORE PROFESSIONAL THAN IF I WAS 
JUST READING OUT OF A BOOK OR A 
MAP EVEN OR GOING TO GOOGLE 
LOOKING AT CLIENTS' DIARIES IT 
MAKES A SMOOTH RUNNING OF A COMPANY 
A LITTLE BIT BETTER I'VE BEEN TO 
CHRISTMAS PARTIES I'M TREATED LIKE 
A MEMBER OF THEIR STAFF THEY TAKE 
ME OUT FOR MEALS ONE CLIENT 
ACTUALLY SPENT QUITE A LOT OF MONEY 
FOR ME TO GO TO A SPA IN CHESTER 
WE HAD THE DAY THERE 
I HAVE TEN 
COMPANIES ON MY PORTFOLIO THEY 
RANGE FROM COMPANIES WITH THREE HUNDRED 
CLIENTS TO COMPANIES WITH TEN OR FIFTEEN 
CLIENTS 
OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE RING UP CLIENTS THEY HAVE NO IDEA YOU ARE NOT WITH 
THE COMPANY HOW DO YOU MANAGE 
THAT 
THEY HAVE NO IDEA AT ALL L. THAT AM PRETENDING I'M IN THEIR OFFICE 
I TAKE THE CALL FOR THEM AND I'M 
THE FIRST PORT OF CALL FOR THAT 
PERSON WHO CALLS IN 
HOW CAN DO YOU 
THAT HOW CAN YOU KNOW EVERYONE 
YOU MUST DEAL WITH THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE EVERY DAY 
BY GETTING TO 
KNOW YOUR CLIENT INTERACTING WITH 
THEM ON A DAILY BASIS RECEIVING E. 
MAILS PHONING THEM BACK AND 
FINDING OUT WHAT THEIR DIARY 
MOVEMENTS ARE THAT MAKES ME KNOW A 
BIT MORE ABOUT THEIR COMPANY AND 
WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING ON A 
DAY TO DAY BASIS 
MANY OF ITS 
CUSTOMERS USE MONEYPENNY AS AN 
OVERFLOW PICKING UP CALLS WHEN 
THEIR OWN SWITCH BOARDS ARE FULL 
THEY'VE BEEN SURPRISED TO FIND OUT 
HOW MUCH BUSINESS THEY HAVE BEEN 
MISSING 
IT'S INTERESTING ONE OF MISSING THE THINGS WE SUSPECTED WE WERE 
NOT CAPTURING ALL OF THE CALLS INTO 
THE BUSINESS WE THOUGHT WE WERE 
GETTING ABOUT ONE THOUSAND CALLS A MONTH 
INTO OUR OFFICES WE ARE ACTUALLY 
RECORDING MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CALLS IN 
THE PEAK OF THE SEASON WHICH IS 
THROUGH THE SUMMER FOR US 
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF 
CUSTOMERS THAT WERE NOT GETTING 
THEIR PHONE ANSWERED SO THEY 
PROVIDE A MUCH BETTER SERVICE FOR 
US 
IN OUR FIRST MONTH WITH US MONEYPENNY WE FOUND OUT WE HAD 
POTENTIALLY LOST I THINK IT WAS FOURTEEN 
EVALUATIONS THOSE EVALUATIONS 
PERHAPS THESE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE RUN 
BACK I DON'T KNOW MOST PEOPLE 
MIGHT RING AN ESTATE AGENT ONCE OR 
TWICE MAYBE THREE TIMES IF THEY 
WERE DESPERATE TO GET HOLD OF THAT 
ESTATE AGENT MOST PEOPLE WOULD 
RING TWICE AND THEN GIVE UP WE 
GAINED FOURTEEN EVALUATIONS DIRECTLY WERE 
MONEYPENNY PICKING THE CALL UP AND 
GIVING US THE INFORMATION AND US 
RINGING THEM BACK AND MANAGE THE 
ARRANGEMENT THOSE FOURTEEN JOBS THEY 
COULD HAVE BEEN WORTH THIRTY THOUSAND OF 
COMMISSION TO US 
OUTSOURCING IS 
TRADITIONALLY ASSOCIATED WITH 
LOSING JOBS BUT THE FIRM DENIES 
THAT COMPANIES USING ITS SERVICES 
TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CUT STAFF 
FOR MANY OF OUR CLIERPBGTS WE ARE 
THEIR RECEPTIONIST'S BEST FRIEND 
SHE CAN HAVE THAT LUNCH BREAK GO 
ON HOLIDAY AND KNOW THE COMPANY 
WON'T GRIND TO A HALT 
MONEYPENNY HAS ALSO DOUBLED IN SIZE 
EVERY YEAR SINCE IT WAS LAUNCHED 
THIS YEAR WILL GROW BY AROUND SEVENTY PER CENT 
IT'S AN INCREASING TREND IN 
BUSINESS AS COMPANIES LOOK TO CUT 
COSTS BY 
SERVICES 
WHEREVER POSSIBLE AND FIRMS LIKE 
THIS MAKE THE MOST OF NEW 
TECHNOLOGY TO HELP THEM DO IT 
IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS STUDIES 
STUDENT PERHAPS WANT TO SEE THAT 
ALL AGAIN ON OUTSOURCING GO TO OUR 
WEBSITE LATER THIS AFTERNOON AT 
B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U. K. SLASH WORKINGLUNCH BBCCO.UK SLASH WORKINGLUNCH THERE IS ALSO THE USUAL FULL BACK 
CATALOGUE OF LUNCH LESSONS AND 
DETAILS OF HOW TO OBTAIN THEM 
SAVING MONEY IS A SKILL AN ART AND 
IT'S DOWN RIGHT DIFFICULT WE 
WANTED YOUR QUESTIONS FOR CONSUMING 
ISSUES ON SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS 
WELCOME TO DONNA BRADSHAW FROM IFG 
FINANCIAL SRMS IT'S BEEN A COUPLE 
OF YEARS SINCE HAVE YOU BEEN ON 
HERE 
IT HAS INDEED 
HAS IT TAKEN HERE THAT LONG TO RECOVER YES WELCOME YES WELCOME MANY IN THE AREA THAT BILL COOKE 
ASKED ALONG WITH MY WIESKS WE 
HAVE SEPARATE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AT A 
HIGH STREET BANK AND HAVE TAKEN 
STEPS TO REDUCE THESE BELOW THE 
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND GUARANTEE LEVEL THAT IS 
IN CASE OF A BANK COLLAPSE YES YES WE HAVE SHARE HOLEDINGS AND 
UNINVESTED CASH IN PEPS AND ISAS 
THEY SUBJECT TO SEPARATE LEVELS OF 
PROTECTION AND WHAT HAPPENED TO MR. 
DARLING'S PROPOSAL OF INCREASING 
CREDIT PROTECTION 
I SPOKE TO THE 
FSCS ABOUT IT THERE ARE DIFFERENT 
LELS OF COMPENSATION FOR DIFFERENT 
TYPES OF INVESTMENT NOW THE DEPOT 
ITER PROTECTION IS THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HOWEVER 
INVESTMENTS THE MAX PROTECTION 
THERE IS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF THE FIRST 
THIRTY THOURKS AND NINETY PER CENT OF THE NEXT 
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEPS AND ISAS ARE LIKE 
CASH BUT THE FSCS DIDN'T KNOW THE 
ANSWER I HAD THEN TO GO TO A 
PROVIDER TO DOUBLE CHECK BUT DO BE 
CAREFUL BECAUSE MINI CASH ISA S. ARE 
DIFFERENT THEY COME UNDER THE 
DEPOSITOR SIDE OF THINGS SO THE 
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND YOU HAVE TO BE VERY 
CAREFUL WHERE YOUR MINI CASH ISA IS 
HELD 
THIS WILL ANOW A LOT OF HELD PEOPLE WHO INVEST YOU ARE 
BASICALLY TELLING ME THAT THE FSCS 
COULD NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION 
DIRECTLY WHEN POSED AND THE THING 
IS THAT IS THE POINT THIS IS SO 
COMPLICATED WITH SAVINGS LET'S 
JUST REFRESH WHAT WE DO KNOW 
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND IN CASH AT THE BANK MAYBE 
YOUR LIFE SAVINGS IS PROTECTED 
UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S SCHEME 
THAT'S CORRECT 
THIS IS ABOUT PEPS 
AND ISAS THAT HAS A HIGHER 
THRESHOLD BECAUSE IT'S AN 
INVESTMENT 
THAT'S CORRECT EVEN IF INVESTMENT YOU HAVE IT IN A CASH HOLDING 
ACCOUNT 
WITH THE SAME BANK YES ACCOUNT YES THE BANK HAS DIFFERENT SUBSIDIARIES 
YOU ARE MAKING AN INVESTMENT SO 
IT'S COVERED BY INVESTMENTS THERE 
IS ALSO DIFFERENT PROTECTION FOR 
LIFE ASSURANCE AND FOR PENSIONS 
THAT IS HIGHER THERE IS NO UPPER 
LIMIT ON IT 
WE SHOULD OVERALL FEEL 
COMFORTABLE THAT THERE IS THIS 
PROTECTION AND WE SHOULD REMEMBER 
THAT NOBODY IS PREDICTING A CASH OF 
OUR BANKING SYSTEM BUT IF YOU WANT 
TO NAIL THIS DOWN IT SOUNDS LIKE 
YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR ADVICE AND 
PERHAPS CALL THE PROVIDER JUST ASK 
DIRECTLY WHAT IS THE PROTECTION 
FOR THE FOLLOWING FIVE ACCOUNTS 
THAT ME AND THE MISSUS HAVE WITH 
YOU 
INDEED CHECK IF IT'S UNDER A YOU SINGLE REGISTRATION BECAUSE THERE 
IS A LOT OF BANKS THAT HAVE A 
NUMBER OF BANKS BENEATH THEM YOU 
HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT PAUL PAUL IS THINKING OF INVESTING HIS STOCKS 
AND SHARES AS AN ISA IN AN EMERGING 
MARKET PARTICULARLY RUSSIA 
WORKING LUNCH WENT TO RUSSIA WE 
SAW GROWTH GOING ON BUT THEY'VE 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE ECONOMY HE HAS 
HEARD MIXED REVIEWS ABOUT WHETHER 
IT'S WISE COME OF THE FENCE WHAT 
DO YOU THINK PAUL SHOULD DO WITH A 
RUSSIA TYPE OF INVESTMENT 
I THINK 
THE RUSSIA STORY IS QUITE 
COMPELLING WITH ANY EMERGING 
MARKET IT'S A HIGH RISK INVESTMENT 
IT'S NOT WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO PUT 
YOUR MONEY BUT SAY UP TO FIVE PER CENT TO 
PLAY WITH BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE 
IS POTENTIAL GROWTH THE STORY 
LOOKS VERY GOOD THEY'VE GOT MUCH 
MORE STABLE ECONOMY AND POLITICAL 
STRUCTURE THERE'S ALSO A RISING 
MIDDLE CLASS THEY HAVE VAST 
NATURAL RESOURCES BUT IN THE 
SHORT TERM IF THERE IS A GLOBAL 
SLOWDOWN THEY'RE LIKELY TO SUFFER 
TOO FOR THE LONG TERM IT STILL 
LOOKS AN ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT 
DONE NARKS YOU HAVE REACHED BACK TO 
ONE OF THE OLDEST INVESTING TIPS IN 
THE BOOK DIVERSIFY THE OTHER END 
OF THE HIGH RISK IS TO THE STAPLES 
IN THE BRITISH ECONOMY PEOPLE 
STILL NEED FOOD AND FUEL AND THEY 
STILL NEED TRANSPORT YOU COULD 
BALANCE YOUR PORTFOLIO WITH THINGS 
LIKE THAT 
EXACTLY IT'S THE PEOPLE 
WHO OVERTRADE OR TRY TO GUESS THE 
MARKETS THAT GET IT WRONG AND END 
UP LOSING MONEY YOU INVEST FOR THE 
LONG TERM AND YOU MAKE SURE YOU 
DIVERSIFY IT ACROSS A LOT OF ASSET 
CLASSES 
YOU ARE SAYING TO PAUL CLASSES HAVE A TICKLE 
I THINK RUSSIA IS 
STILL QUITE AN ATTRACTIVE 
PROPOSITION 
BUT NOT THE WHOLE LOT PROPOSITION YES 
JOHN BIGGEST IS SURE WE HAVE YES MENTIONED IN A PREVIOUS PROGRAMME 
IT'S POSSIBLE TO BUY SINGLE SHARES 
WHICH REPRESENT THE PERFORMANCE OF 
A PARTICULAR OVERSEAS STOCK MARKET 
HE WANTS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT 
WHAT THEY'RE KNOWN AS IS ESTRANGED 
TRADER FUNDS THEY'RE NOW MORE 
WIDELY AVAILABLE PARTICULARLY 
SINCE FORMER CHANCELLOR GORDON 
BROWN 
NEVER HEARD OF HIM BROWN RELAXED THE STAMP DUTY ON THEM BUT 
THEY DO HAVE THEIR RISKS AS WELL 
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE RELATIVELY 
CHEAP THERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH 
CURRENCY RISK IN THEM AND ALSO OF 
OVERTRADING WHICH ACTUALLY CAN PUT 
THE COST UP BUT THEY'RE EASILY 
AVAILABLE VIA STOCKBROKERS LOOK 
AROUND AND CHECK THE ONE WITH THE 
BEST RATES FOR TRADING 
JOY WANTS TO KNOW CAN SHE TRANSFER 
HER CASH ISA TO HER CHILDREN OR 
GRANDCHILDREN SHE HATES THE IDEA 
OF HER CHILDREN HAVING TO PAY TAX 
ON THEM L. THINK SHE IS 
ANTICIPATING MOVING TO A HIGHER 
HIGHER PLAIN AT THE MOMENT THIS IS 
A QUESTION ABOUT INHERITANCE I 
THINK THINK I THINK IT IS 
AND THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS NO YOU 
CAN'T TRANSFER THEM BUT SHE CAN 
GIFT MONEY TO THEM OVER TIME 
IN HERE LIFETIME 
A LOT OF PEOPLE 
ARE UNDER THE ILLUSION THAT PEPS 
AND ISAS ARE FREE OF INHERITANCE 
TAX THAT'S NOT THE CASE SHE WAS 
WORRIED ABOUT THE CHILDREN HAVING 
NO SAVINGS AND HELPING THEM OUT 
SHE CAN GIVE THEM MONEY FOR HER 
GRANDCHILDREN AND LOOK AT CHILD 
TRUST FUND AND FOR HER CHILDREN PUT 
THE MONEY INTO AN ISA AND BUILD IT 
UP OVER TIME 
YOU CAN GIVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF 
MONEY BUT YOU HAVE TO LIVE FOR 
SEVEN YEARS 
THERE IS AN ANNUAL 
ALLOWANCE AND YOU CAN MAKE GIFTS 
OUT OF NORMAL EXPENDITURE SO SHE 
CAN GIVE A LOT AWAY 
WE SHOULD TELL JOY LIVE LONG AND 
HAPPY HAPPY THE ISLES OF SCILLY HAS BETTER 
BETTER FOOD THAN LEEDS OR LIVERPOOL 
ACCORDING TO THE MICHELIN GUIDE 
THE TWO NORTHERN CITIES ARE BETTER 
REPRESENT OF A MICHELIN STAR 
THE ISLAND HAS BEEN AWARDED ITS 
FIRST MICHELIN HOW DOES KENNY 
ATKINSON DO T. RACHEL FINDS OUT 
IT IS SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY AND KENNY ATKINSON IS 
ABOUT TO START HIS SIXTEEN HOUR DAY IN 
THE LAST TWO YEARS HE MOVED HIS 
FAMILY TO THE ISLES OF SCILLY 
TAKEN OVER RESTAURANT THAT CLOSED 
FOR FOUR MONTHS OF THE YEAR AND TO 
REALISE EVERY CHEF'S DREAM SCORED 
HIS FIRST MICHELIN STAR 
KENNY IS HEAD CHEF AT THE 
RESTAURANT AT SAINT MARTIN'S ON THE 
ISLE HOTEL SAINT MARTIN MARTIN IS ONE 
OF THE OF THE ISLES OF SCILLY TWENTY EIGHT 
MILES OFF THE COAST OF CORNWALL 
THERE IS NOT MUCH PASSING TRADE AND 
THE EIGHT MONTH TOURIST SEASON FROM 
MARCH TO OCTOBER IS CRUCIAL 
HAVING JUST WON HIS FIRST MICHELIN 
STAR HE IS DESPERATE TO MAINTAIN 
HIGH STANDARDS BUT THE HOTEL JUST 
OPENED FOR THE SEASON AND HE ONLY 
HAS A FEW DAYS TO GET HIS NEW TEAM 
UP TO SCRATCH 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON FOR 
ME IS PRESSURE WE HAVE FOURTEEN NEW 
STAFF ARRIVING ELEVEN HU STAFF 
ARRIVING THREE FROM LAST YEAR IT 
MEANS SIXTEEN HOUR DAYS FOR THE FIRST 
WEEK GETTING GUYS TRAIN UP 
GETTING TO UNDERSTAND THE ISLAND 
NOT JUST THE FOOD SIDE BUT THE 
WASTE DISPOSAL AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
JUST CONSTANT CONSTANT TRAINING 
IT MEANS A LOT OF PRESSURE 
I DO TRY AND GET THE BEST OUT OF 
THE GUYS L. DON'T WANT THE GUYS 
COMING TO WORK BEING SCARED L. WANT 
THEM TO THINK LET'S GET TO WORK 
AND BE EXCITED IF THE GUYS ARE 
EXCITED THEY ARE PASSIONATE AND 
THE FOOD WILL BE EXCITING AND 
PASSIONATE I CAN'T GET A STAR ON 
BEING JUST ME I NEED THE GUYS TO 
BE PULLING FROM ALL ANGLES TO HELP 
US ACHIEVE WHAT WE WANT TO DO 
GET THE TURN TURNIPS DONE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE 
TRYING TO ACHIEVE IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO GET QUALITY GUYS TO WORK HERE 
WHEN WE GOT THE STAR IT WAS LIKE A 
FLOODGATE OF CVS COME THROUGH 
PEOPLE WANT TO WORK HERE AND PEOPLE 
WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN WHAT WE ARE 
TRYING TO DO AND THAT'S GREAT 
THAT'S WHAT MICHELIN IS ABOUT FOR 
US JUST TO SHOW WE ARE A QUALITY 
RESTAURANT AND WHAT WE ARE TRYING 
TO ACHIEVE 
KENNY'S WAS ONE OF FIFTEEN NEW MICHELIN 
STARS AWARDED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
NOW HE IS UNPRESSURE TO KEEP IT A 
MICHELIN STAR CAN TRANSFORM THE 
MORE THE FORTUNES OF A RESTAURANT 
INCREASE BOOKINGS AND ATTRACT THE 
BEST STAFF BUT AS EASILY AS TO WIN 
ONE THEY CAN BE TAKEN AWAY 
THE MICHELIN RELEASE WAS DONE ON 
WEDNESDAY MORNING L. WAS IN ONE OF 
THE STAFF BEDROOM'S ON THE WIRELESS 
INTERNET WHEN WHEN IT WAS RELEASED 
WE SEEN THAT OUR RESTAURANT WON A 
MICHELIN STAR AND OUT CAME THE 
CHAMPAGNE CHAMPAGNE HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU SCORED 
IT 
I CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW I FELT IT IT WAS OVERWHELMING RELIEF EXCITEMENT 
FOR ME TO ACHIEVE THE MICHELIN STAR 
WAS THE PINNACLE OF MY CAREER IT 
IS TO ACHIEVE IT IT IS SO MUCH 
RECOGNITION ALMOST EVERYONE KNOWS 
WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO GO THERE NOW 
THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO IT HAS 
CHANGED A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE DO 
NOW NOW IT HAS BEEN FANTASTIC I CAN'T PUT 
IT INTO WORDS 
THERE MUST OF BEEN PRESSURE TO GET 
THE STAR NOW YOU HAVE GOT T. WHAT'S 
THE PRESSURE LIKE TO KEEP IT IT IT HAS TREBLED IT IS IT IS NOT THERE 
FOR LIFE FROM GETTING THE STAR IT 
IS GREAT PUBLICITY EVERYBODY WANTS 
TO WORK HERE 
TO LOSE ONE OH IT IS A PLACE 
GOING DOWN HILL 
IF KENNY IS 
FEELING THE HEAT SO ARE HIS STAFF 
THERE IS LOT OF PRESSURE BECAUSE 
WE HAVE TO BE READY FOR SET TIME 
IN THE EVENING FOR DINNER SERVICE 
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE SPOT ON YOU 
CAN'T HAVE ANY MISTAKES WE DON'T 
WANT SECOND BEST SO WE'VE GOT TO BE 
PERFECT PERFECT I THINK KENNY IS AN AMAZING CHEF 
HE HAS QUITE TALENT FOR GETTING 
THE BEST OUT OF PEOPLE 
AND HIS FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
THE IDEAS THAT HOW THEY END UP ON 
THE PLATE IS IT BLOWS MY HEAD 
EVERY TIME 
WHEN THE RESTAURANT OPENS KENNY 
TRIES TO USE SEASONAL AND LOCAL 
PRODUCE WHICH MEANS MEANS LOTS OF 
SHELLFISH AND SEAFOOD HE ALSO HAS 
TO THINK LOGISTICS 
BECAUSE WE ARE ON AN LAND WE HAVE 
TO RELY ON THE MAINLAND FOR OUR 
MEATS AND THE FISH 
WHICH IS FANTASTIC YOU GET 
SUPPLY FROM TRURO OUR CHEESE ARE 
FROM CORNWALL AS WE GET THESE 
THINGS SEN OVER WHICH MEANS 
PACKAGING EVERYTHING THAT COMES 
OVER WE GET CHARGED WEIGHT IT IS 
ABOUT BUYING THE INGREEDANT WE ARE 
PAYING DELIVERY WHICH IS IS A BIG 
ISSUE ISSUE KENNY MIGHT BE ALL ACTION IN THE 
KITCHEN BUT ONE OF THE MAIN 
REASONS HE MOVED HERE WAS FOR HIS 
FAMILY FAMILY IT WAS HARD L. HAD A THREE MONTH 
OLD BABY AND MY WIFE WERE MOVING 
AWAY FROM THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS 
IT WAS HARD AT FIRST BUT WE KNEW 
THAT WHEN AARON GOT OLDER THERE IS 
A SCHOOL WITH FIVE OR SIX CHILDREN 
WHICH MEANS PRACTICALLY PRIVATE 
EDUCATION THE SCHOOL IS HIGH ON 
THE OFSTED REPORT IT WAS JUST AN 
OPPORTUNITY OF ALMOST PRIVATE 
EDUCATION EDUCATION AND ALSO BECAUSE I ONLY LIVE FIVE 
MINUTES FROM WORK MY WIFE CAN 
BRING AARON DOWN 
I CAN BRING HIM TO THE BEACH AND 
CHASE SEAGULLS WHEN HE GETS OLDER 
WE CAN GO FISHING THINGS I WOULD 
NEVER DO LIVING IN THE CITY 
AFTER A WALK ON THE BEACH IT IS 
TIME TO GET READY FOR THE MAIN 
EVENT OF THE DAY DINNER AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE SEASON THE 
RESTAURANT HAS A SOFT SOFT OPENING 
WHERE INVITED LOCAL GUESTS EAT FOR 
FREE IT GIVES TENNY'S TEAM THE 
KENNY TEAM THE CHANCE TO TO POLISH 
THEIR SKILLS BEFORE THE PAYING 
GUESTS ARRIVED 
WE PICKED UP AN EXTRA COUPLE OF 
COURSE BECAUSE WE CLOSED THE BISTRO 
OUR DELIVERY BOAT CAME IN LATE IT 
DIDN'T COME IN UNTIL TWO HUNDRED P. M. RATHER 
THAN TWELVE O'CLOCK EVERYONE IS ON 
ENCH BUT EDGE BUT EXCITED IT 
IS CLOSE BUT WE WILL BE ALL RIGHT 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON 
KENNY 
DO S. 
THE FINAL PLATING 
HIMSELF BUT HE WILL START TO HAND 
OVER SOME DUTIES TO HIS TEAM 
IN THE DINING ROOM THE ISLANDERS 
ARE ENJOYING ONE OF THEIR BEST FREE 
MEALS OF THE YEAR BUT SOON THE 
PAYING GUESTS WILL ARRIVE AND THE 
MICHELIN STAR INSPECTOR WILL HAVE 
TO BE SERVED 
LET'S GET CLEANED DOWN AND GET OUT 
AT THE END OF A LONG SERVICE 
SERVICE ALL THAT'S LEFT IS FOR 
KENNY TO THANK HIS TEAM BEFORE THEY 
START IT ALL OVER OVER AGAIN IN THE 
MORNING MORNING DOES IT WORK IF YOU SAY I'M A 
MICHELIN STAR INSPECTOR IF YOU ARE 
A REGULAR TO YOUR SCREEN AT THIS 
TIME WE ARE OBSESSED WITH FAMILY 
FIRMS OVER THE THE YEARS WE HAVE 
HEARD OF THE LIGHT BULB MOMENTS 
THAT TRANSFORMED THE LIVES OF 
COUPLES WHO SWAP WORKING FOR OTHER 
PEOPLE FOR WORKING WITH THEMSELVES 
WHAT HAPPENS YEARS FROM NOW WHEN 
THE FUTURE GENERATIONS TAKE OVER 
YOUR PRECIOUS BUSINESS HERE IS AN 
EXERT FROM A NEW BACK BACK CALLED 
FAMILY WARS GRANT GRANT GORDON 
GIVES US AN EXCLUSIVE READING ON 
THE GUINNESS BUSINESS 
THE GUINNESSES HAD BECOME MEMBERS 
OF THE IRISH A. R. R. I. S. TOCK RASSY THE 
FAMILY CLUNG ON TO POWER AND 
CONTROL NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE 
GREEDY FOR COMMAND BUT MORE FROM A 
SENSE OF DUTY 
IT SEEMED TO BE A TENANT THAT WAS 
HELD IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE 
FAMILY MEMBERS HAD ANY FORMAL 
EDUCATION OR TRAINING TO ENABLE 
THEM TO RRY SUCH A 
RESPONSIBILITY FAMILY MEMBERS 
WHERE NOT APPOINTED TO THE BOARD ON 
THE BASIS OF THEIR COMPETENCE FOR 
EXAMPLE BRIAN GIN GUINNESS WHO 
JOINED THE COMPANY'S BOARD IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE 
HAD BEEN TRAINED IN THE LAW BUT 
HAD GIVEN UP PRACTISING TO BECOME A 
FARMERMENT SADLY THE BOARDS IN 
SOME FAMILY COMPANIES TODAY STILL 
REFLECT THIS KIND OF FAMILY 
PLACEMENT PLACEMENT GRANT GORDON IS DIRECTOR GENERAL OF 
THE INSTITUTE FOR FAMILY BUSINESS 
WELCOME WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON 
WE WILL COME TO YOUR BUSINESS IN A 
MINUTE I'M THINKING DALLAS 
DYNASTY THE BROTHERS FAMILIES AT 
WAR WAR FAMILIES AT WAR LET'S START WITH 
THE MYTHS PEOPLE THINK THAT 
CONFLICT IS BAD WELL CONFLICT CAN 
BE BAD IF IT IS ABOUT IF IT IS 
ABOUT PROSPECTIVE NOT ABOUT 
PERSONALITIES AS WE SEE IN FAMILY 
WARS THE PROBLEMS OF NEPOTISM THE 
PROBLEM AROUND PROMOTING FAMILY 
MEMBERS NOT BASED ON MERIT 
PROBLEMS AROUND REWARD GREED THE 
ISSUES AROUND SALARY REWARDS AND 
FINANCIAL REWARDS NOT BEING OPEN 
AND TRANSPARENT ABOUT THOSE 
SIBLING RICHLERY THE FIGHTING 
BETWEEN FAMILY MEMBERS AND FAMILY 
MEMBERS BROTHERS OR BROTHERS AND 
SISTERS WHO ARE PUT INTO 
COMPETITION WITH EACH OTHER AND 
LAST BUT NOT LEAST PROBABLY THE 
ISSUE OF SUCCESSION ARGUABLY THE 
ACHILLES HEEL OF FAMILY BUSINESS 
AND THE ISSUE OF NOT PLANNING FOR 
THE GENERATIONAL TRANSITION IN THE 
FAMILY BUSINESS BUT THE ISSUE OF 
THE SENIOR GENERATION NOT HAVING 
THE AWARENESS AND KNOWING WHEN TO 
LET GO 
YOU GOT A GREAT INSIGHT TO THIS 
YOU NOT ONLY RUN THE INSTITUTE FOR 
FAMILY BUSINESS BUT GRANT GORDON 
GRANT IS THE WHISKY IT IS NOT THE 
FAMILY BUSINESS WHICH RUNS GORDON 
GINS AS WELL 
NO NO IN THE BOOK YOU GO THROUGH A NUMBER 
OF EXAMPLES OF DIFFERENT FAMILY 
BUSINESSES AND ONE OF THEM WAS 
HYATT FAMILY 
A VERY SUCCESSFUL FAMILY BUSINESS 
I WOULD LIKE TO PICK UP ON THIS 
THE PAIDTRY ARC OF THIS BUSINESS 
HE BUILT A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR 
BUSINESS IN CHICAGO HE ONE DAY 
SUMMON THE FAMILY IN WHEN HE WAS AN 
OLD MAN AND READ THEM LETTER OF 
HIS WISHES TIME WENT ON THE NEXT 
GENERATION THEY WEREN'T REALLY ONE 
IN TERMS OF WHAT THEIR VISION WAS 
SADLY J. J. PASSED AWAY AND THE 
BUSINESS HAS BEEN SPLIT UP YOU 
CAN'T RULE FROM THE GRAVE 
THERE IS ANOTHER ONE 
YES IT IS A NICE STORY IT IS 
ABOUT SWEET WINE THE WORLD'S 
GREATEST SWEET WINE BUT IT HAS A 
SOUR ENDING THE MAN WHO RAN THIS 
BUSINESS THE COUNT ALEXANDER WHO 
RAN A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IT WENT 
TO HIS HEAD AND HE IGNORED THE REST 
OF THE FAMILY HE NEVER GAVE THEM A 
BOTTLE OF WINE FOR EXAMPLE 
HE NEVER GAVE THEM A BOTTLE OF WINE 
NOT ONCE SADLY THE BUSINESS WAS 
SOLD AND IS NO LONGER IN FAMILY 
HANDS TODAY 
THERE ARE OTHER OTHER EXAMPLES 
WHICH I WON'T GET THROUGH I'M 
WONDERING ABOUT TIPS IN PARTICULAR 
IF YOU RUN A BUSINESS NOW IF I RUN 
A BUSINESS I GIVE IT TO ADAM AND I 
PAY TAX IF I BEQUEATH IT TO MY 
CHILDREN THERE IS NO TAX IF I 
FOLLOW THE RULES RIGHT WHAT ARE 
YOUR TIPS ON RUNNING A SUCCESSFUL 
BUSINESS 
THE CONTEXT FOR THIS IS BUSINESS THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY BUSINESS 
IN THE U. K. FAMILY BUSINESSES ASSES 
WE HAVE SHOWN BUSINESSES AS WE 
HAVE SHOWN THERE IS THREE MILLION 
BUSINESSES EMPLOYING MANY PEOPLE 
THEY ARE OFTEN GETTING IT RIGHT 
THERE ARE THINGS THEY CAN DO TO GET 
IT MORE RIGHT AND IT IS IMPORTANT 
THEY DO ONE THING IS HAVING RULES 
HAVING PROTOCOLS HAVING MECK CHEAN 
MECHANISMS FOR TAKING DECISIONS 
AND THAT HELPS MANAGE THE BUSINESS 
ANOTHER TIP THAT IS USEFUL IS 
THINKING ABOUT EXTERNAL ADVICE HOW 
YOU CAN GET INPUT FROM PEOPLE WHO 
ARE OBJECTIVE AND WHO WILL HELP 
SHARE WITH YOU UNDERSTAND AND 
DEVELOP THE STRATEGY FOR YOUR 
FAMILY BUSINESS AND WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT INDEPENDENT NON EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS AND THE ROLE THAT THEY 
CAN PLAY 
GRANT GORDON THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
BEFORE EASTER YOU MAY REMEMBER WE 
HAD A SERIES OF REPORTS FROM 
GILLIAN ABOUT THE RAPIDLY 
DEVELOPING ECONOMY OF BRAZIL WHILE 
SHE WAS OUT THERE SHE MET UP WITH 
A GROUP OF BRITISH BUSINESSMEN AND 
WOMEN WHO HAD HEARD ABOUT THE 
POTENTIAL OF THE COUNTRY AND WERE 
LOOKING OUT FOR THEIR OWN BUSINESS 
OPPORTUNITIES OPPORTUNITIES THIS MONTH MARKS THE TWO HUNDREDTH 
ANNIVERSARY OF BRITAIN AND BRAZIL 
DOING TRADE TODAY BACK THENG WE 
WERE HUGELY INFLUENTIAL ONE OF 
BRAZIL'S TOP FIVE TRADING PARTNERS 
NOW THE SITUATION HAS CHANGE AND 
NOT FOR THE BETTER IN TERMS OF THE 
LIST OF TRADING PARTNERS NOW WE'RE 
THIRTY SIXTH ALL OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
TRADE BRAZIL DOES BRITAIN ACCOUNTS 
FOR TWO PER CENT OF IT ALL OF THAT HOPEFULLY 
THOUGH IS ABOUT TO CHANGE THAT'S 
THE AIM OF THE BRITISH CONSUE 
SULIATE THEY'RE BASED IN THIS 
SPLENDID BUILDING BEHIND ME AND 
THEY HOST TRADE DELEGATIONS THE 
FIRST ONE OF THE YEAR IS COMING 
TODAY GROUP FROM THE NORTH EAST 
OF ENGLAND THEY'RE HERE TO FORGE 
LASTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH 
BRAZILIAN COMPANIES 
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T SPEAK 
PORTUGUESE I SAID HELLO IT'S IT'S THE JOB OF THE CONSUL GENERAL TO 
TRANSLATE THE AIMS OF THE DELEGATES 
INTO REALITY SO WHY ARE THEY SO 
KEEN TO COME 
THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT MUST 
ATTRACT PEOPLE TO BRAZIL ABOUT 
ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S THE SIZE AND 
THE SCALE YOU HAVE GOT A MARKET OF 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE EIGHTY FOUR PER CENT OF WHOM ARE 
URBAN YOU HAVE VERY 
SOPHISTICATED INDUSTRIAL BASE 
BUILT UP THROUGH THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
YOU HAVE GOT AN ENORMOUS LEVEL OF 
RESOURCES NATURAL RESOURCES BOTH 
IN THE AGRIBUSINESS SIDE YOU HAVE 
GOT HUGE WATER RESOURCES TWELVE PER CENT OF 
THE WORLD'S FRESH WATER HERE IN 
BRAZIL YOU HAVE GOT A VERY MODERN 
AND SOPHISTICATED ECONOMY IT'S A 
PLACE THAT PEOPLE CAN DO BUSINESS 
WITH SOME COMPLICATIONS BUT THEY 
CAN DO BUSINESS HERE AND OUR AIM IS 
TO POINT THEM IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION 
EACH MEMBER OF THE GROUP DIRECTION HAS PAID SIX HUNDRED TO BE PART OF THE 
TRIP WHETHER THEY COME FROM THE 
WORLD OF THEATRE AND DANCE OR FROM 
HEAVY INDUSTRY 
SO SPECIFICALLY WHAT ARE THE 
DELEGATES HOPING TO ACHIEVE 
KATE GORDON WORKS FOR AN 
ORGANISATION CALLED INTERNSTUDY 
SHE'S IN BRAZIL TO FIND WORK 
PLACEMENTS FOR EUROPEAN STUDENTS 
RICHARD FINLOW REPRESENTS NEXUS 
WHO SELL AUDIO AND VIDEO 
ACCESSORIES HE WANTS TO IDENTIFY 
SOME BRAZILIAN RETAILERS TO STOCK 
HIS PRODUCTS ALAN CLARKE'S 
BUSINESS MECHETRONICS WANTS TO 
EXPORT TO BRAZIL AND HE WANTS THE 
BRAZILIANS 
TO THE U. K. 
THEY'RE ALL OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR 
CHANCES HOW USEFUL IS IT BEING 
PART OF A TRADE DELEGATION IT'S IT'S VERY AWFUL ACTUALLY YOU HAVE 
AUTOMATICALLY GOT SOME EXTRA 
CONTACTS PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE 
MARKET VERY WELL YOU CAN RELY ON 
THEIR RESOURCES GET THE 
INTRODUCTIONS I THINK WHEN YOU ARE 
DOING BUSINESS IN BRAZIL IN 
PARTICULAR HAVING THOSE 
RELATIONSHIPS AND INTRODUCTIONS IS 
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A VERY 
SORT OF PERSONABLE MARKET AND 
EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW EVERYBODY 
AND THE FACE TO FACE MEETINGS ARE 
VERY IMPORTANT IT'S HELPED QUITE A 
BIT BIT WHAT IS YOUR HOPE 
AT LEAST TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A 
RELATIONSHIP AND TAKE IT FROM THERE 
IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO SOURCE 
SOME OF THE PRODUCTS FOR THEM FROM 
THE U. K. AND COMPETE WITH SOME OF 
THE LOCAL MANUFACTURERS ESPECIALLY 
THE EXCHANGE RATE SITUATION THE 
EVALUATION OF THE REAL IN PREVIOUS 
YEARS RIGHT UP UNTIL NOW HAS MADE 
IMPORTS VERY ATTRACTIVE TO 
BRAZILIAN CONSUMERS 
WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT THE 
BRAZILIAN MARKET IS ALL ABOUT WE 
HAVE SEEN LOT OF MANUFACTURERS 
JUST MOVED ALL OF THEIR PRODUCTION 
TO MEXICO AND ANOTHER MANUFACTURER 
IS MOVING STUFF INTO BRAZIL SO 
PEOPLE ARE MOVING THEIR 
MANUFACTURING TO THIS PART OF THE 
WORLD AND STARTING TO STEP AWAY 
FROM CHINA AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
IT'S A MARKET WE DEFINITELY NEED TO 
LOOK AT AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS THIS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT BRAZIL AND 
THE PROCESS OF FINDING PARTNERS IS 
FAIRLY TYPICAL SO THE DELEGATION 
INCLUDES MENTORS TO GIVE HINTS ON 
HOW TO SUCCEED 
MY ADVICE TO THEM IS THINK ABOUT 
WHAT THAT BRAZILIAN OR WHAT THAT 
COMPANY OWNER YOU ARE SPEAKING TO 
IS THINKING ABOUT YOU IT'S NOT THE 
SAME AS SELLING IN THE U. K. WHERE WE 
ARE USED TO U. K. CULTURE FROM HERE 
THE U. K. SEEMS LIKE A LITTLE ISLAND 
OFF THE COAST OF MAINLAND EUROPE 
WHAT CAN THEY THINK ABOUT YOU AND 
YOUR PRODUCT 
AFTER A MORNING OF BEING PRIMED 
WITH INFORMATION THE DELEGATES 
WENT THEIR SEPARATE WAYS ON VISITS 
ORGANISED FOR THEM BY THE CONSULATE 
AS JEFF SAID THEY WERE EXPECT A 
CHA ENG SO NOW WINDING THE CLOCK 
FORWARDS BY FOUR WEEKS HOW DID 
THEY FARE VERY WELL TO BE HONEST 
KATE HAS MANAGED TO FIND PLACEMENTS 
FOR TWELVE EUROPEAN STUDENTS TO GO TO 
BRAZIL AND TWENTY BRAZILIANS TO GO TO 
EUROPE FIVE TIMES THE NUMBER SHE 
WAS EXPECTING 
RICHARD IS DRAWING UP TERMS WITH A 
LEADING NATIONWIDE DISTRIBUTOR FOR 
HIS PRODUCT AND EXPECTING TO SIGN 
AGREEMENTS SHORTLY ALSEASON NOW IN 
ONGOING TALKS WITH POTENTIAL TALKS 
AND DRAWING UP PROTOTYPES THESE 
MAY BE HUMBLE STEPS SO FAR BUT 
IT'S STEPS LIKE THIS WHICH COULD 
HERALD A NEW ERA TAKING US FULL 
CIRCLE TO ENJOYING THE 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH BRAZIL WHICH 
BRITAIN HAD TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
WHILST WE'VE BEEN ON AIR IN THE 
PAST FIFTEEN MINUTES WE HAVE HEARD FROM 
HBOS THAT THE BIGGEST MORTGAGE 
LENDER IN THE U. K. IS GOING TO RAISE 
MORTGAGE RATES ON MONDAY AND INDEED 
INTRODUCE A NEW PRICING BAND THAT 
WILL RAISE RATES FOR CUSTOMERS WITH 
SMALL DEPOSITS A NEW PRICING BANDS 
WILL PROVIDE CHEAPER LOANS FOR 
CUSTOMERS WITH DEPOISE ITS OF MORE 
THAN TWENTY FIVE PER CENT ANDY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 
THIS 
IT'S A FUNCTION OF WHAT IS THIS GOING ON OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS 
BANKS HAVE GIVEN IT AWAY FOR FREE 
VIRTUALLY WITH NORTHERN ROCK YOU 
CAN BUY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF YOUR HOUSE AND PAY 
IT BACK WHEN YOU CAN 
IT'S ONLY 
WITH THE BENEFIT OF HEADLINES 
CREDIT WAS CHEAP 
YES THE BANKS 
HAD THIS THING SCALD SECURITYISE 
AGO THEY WENT AND SOLD THEIR LOANS 
TO SOME POOR NORWEGIAN HEDGE FUND 
BASICALLY I. O. U.'S 
YES THE BANK CAN 
ONLY LEND AS MUCH CAPITAL AS IT'S 
GOT YOU GET CAPITAL TOO WAYS 
HAVING A RIGHTS ISSUE OR RETAINING 
YOUR EARNINGS THEY HAVE TO GET 
MORE CAPITAL IN AND LEVERAGE UP 
THEIR BALANCE SHEETS 
BAD NEWS FOR 
PEOPLE WHO WANT A MORTGAGE WITH A 
SMALL DEPOSIT WHAT DOES IT SAY 
ABOUT THE BANKING SECTOR 
THE BANKS 
ARE TRYING TO REBUILD PROFITABILITY 
NOW THEY'RE SAYING WE HAVE GOT 
CAPITAL SCARCE SO MR. AND MRS. JONES 
IF YOU WANT IT YOU HAVE TO PAY UP 
FOR IT 
GOOD NEWS FOR YOU 
YES WE 
HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE AND I THINK 
THE GOVERNMENT WILL CUT RATES AND 
IF YOU CAN GET IT DOWN YOU CAN 
HAVE A SITUATION WHERE BANKS CAN 
REBUILD PROFITABILITY ONCE THEY'RE 
MORE PROFITABLE IT'S EASYER 
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON NEXT 
WEEK NOT THAT BUSY 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY EASYJET 
MICHAEL PAGE RECRUITMENT 
CONSULTANTS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT ON TUESDAY A 
BETTING COMPANY 
EASYJET IT'S HAD 
A FANTASTIC RUN THIS YEAR ITS 
SHARES ARE SEVEN AIR FARES WERE GOING 
OUT THE THING I LIKE ABOUT EASYJET 
WHEN YOU TURN UP WITH YOUR FAMILY 
YOU HAVE A FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. CHANCE OF SITTING 
WITH THEM WE WILL SEE WHAT THEY'VE 
DONE FOR FUEL HEDGING IF ALITALIA 
GOES OUT OF BUSINESS YOU HAVE LESS 
AIRLINES AND PEOPLE STILL WANT TO 
FLY MICHAEL PAGE A RECRUITMENT 
CONSULTANT THEIR SHARES ARE COME 
DOWN FROM SIX TO TWO POINT FIVE OH MORE STRAED 
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD NOW THE THE SECOND HALF OF THE WEEK ALL IN ONE 
GO 
SECOND HALF OF THE WEEK ALL IN ONE GO 
WHAT IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THAT 
LATTER HALF 
SIGNET RETAILING ARE 
PEOPLE POPPING DOWN AND BUYING 
THEIR LOVED ONES DIAMOND RINGS SO 
SIGNET CAN BE UNDER PRESSURE 
VEDANATA A FANTASTIC PERFORMER 
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE WHAT IS 
HAPPENING TO PRODUCTION AND COSTS 
THERE ARE RUMOURS IN THE PAPERS 
YESTERDAY ABOUT CADBURY PRIVATE 
EQUITY INTEREST IN THE PAST 
ISN'T IT A DONE DEAL THEY WILL 
SPLIT INTO TWO CADBURY AND 
SCHWEPPES 
THEY WERE GOING TO SELL SCHWEPPES ONE OF THEM OFF THEY WILL GET CASH 
AND SHARES BUT NOW IT'S GOING TO 
BE TWO BITS OF PAPER 
YOU HAVE A 
BIKE WAITING OUTSIDE TO SPEED YOU 
OFF TO THE BUSY MARKETS 
IT'S A 
LONG CYCLE BACK 
HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND 
DON'T LET THE DOG FALL OUT OF THE 
BASKET ON THE FRONT 
DONE NARKS YOU HAVE KINDLY STAYED 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SAVINGS IF 
PEOPLE ARE IN THE LUCKY POSITION 
WHO HAVE PERHAPS WORKED HARD ALL OF 
THEIR LIVES AND THEY HAVE LITTLE 
MORTGAGE WITH THESE RISING RATES 
IF YOU CAN COULD YOU USE YOUR 
SAVINGS SHOULD YOU USE YOUR 
SAVINGS TO PAY OFF SOME OF THAT 
DEBT IS THIS THE TIME TO CONSIDER 
DUMPING OUT OF THESE MORTGAGES WITH 
THESE BUILDING SOCIETIES TRYING TO 
PICK UP THE MESS THEY'VE LARGERY 
CREATED 
IT DEPENDS ON YOUR CREATED CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IF YOU ARE 
FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE ENDS 
MEET USE YOUR SAVINGS TO REDUCE 
YOUR MORTGAGE DEBT YOUR MONTHLY 
PAYMENTS WILL THEN BE LOWER AND 
THAT WILL HELP EASE THE PAIN IF 
YOU HAVE A FAIRLY SMALL MORTGAGE 
AND IT'S MANAGEABLE THEN THERE MAY 
NOT BE A POINT IN DOING IT THAT'S THAT'S RESEARCH VAL HARVEY SAYS IF YOU 
COMPARE TWO SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WITH 
THE SAME A. E. R. BUT ONE PAYS INTEREST 
MONTHLY AND ONE ANNUALLY WOULD YOU 
END UP WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF 
INTEREST MONEY AT THE END OF THE 
YEAR OR WOULD ONE THAT PAYS 
INTEREST MONTHLY ACCUMULATE MORE 
INTEREST AS YOU GET INTEREST ON 
INTEREST 
THAT'S ANNUAL INTEREST EEQUIVALENT RATE IT'S TO COMPARE 
DIFFERENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS 
EFFECTIVELY IF HE HAVE THE SAME 
A. E. R. YOU WILL HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT 
AT THE END OF THE YEAR EVEN THOUGH 
THEY'RE PUBLISHED HEADLINE RATE MAY 
BE DIFFERENT FOR A MONTHLY AND A 
YEARLY INTEREST PERIOD ACCOUNT 
BERNARD FROM PONTEFRACT SAYS HE 
USED TO HAVE A TESSA WHICH TURNED 
INTO A TOISA NOW IT BECOMES AN 
ISA HE ALREADY HAD MINI CASH ISA 
WITH ANOTHER BANK WILL HE HAVE TO 
CASH IN HIS TOISA OR CAN IT EARN 
TAX FREE INTEREST 
IT IS CONFUSING 
THE ONLY THING THAT IS CHANGING IS 
THE NAME THE LAST THING YOU SHOULD 
DO IS TO CASH IT IN AND THEN TRY 
AND MOVE IT IF YOU WANTS TO MOVE 
TO A DIFFERENT PROVIDER DO IT BY 
TRANSFERRING IT THE SO MONEY 
DOESN'T COME OUT AND COME BACK IN 
IT STAYS THERE AND YOUR PROVIDER 
WILL HELP YOU DO THE TRANSFER CAN CAN I BRING UP ONE THAT IS ON OUR LIST 
LOWER BECAUSE I KNOW THAT DONNA 
WANTS US TO GET TO GILLIE FROM THE 
DORDOGNE WHAT PROTECTION IS IN 
PLACE FOR MONEY HELD IN OFFSHORE 
ACCOUNTS SUCH AS ON THE ISLE OF 
MAN OR GUERNSEY L. PAY TAX IN THE 
U. K. ON MY PENSION BUT HAS A SMALL 
FRENCH INCOME WHICH SHE PACE VERY 
LITTLE TAX ON IT MAKES SENSE FOR 
ME TO HAVE MONEY OFFSHORE HOW 
PROTECTED IS IT 
THIS IS 
INTERESTING I'VE GOT A SISTER FIRM 
THAT ADVISES PEOPLE WHO MOVE TO 
FRANCE LIKE MANY EX PATS WHO ARE 
NOW FRENCH RESIDENTS SHE IS NOT 
DOING THE RIGHT THING WITH HER TAX 
FRANCE TAXES YOUR WORLDWIDE INCOME 
SO HAVING IT OFFSHORE IS NOT A GOOD 
IDEA BECAUSE IT'S LIABLE TO TAX 
THESE OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS DON'T HAVE 
VERY MUCH PROTECTION THE ISLE OF 
MAN IS NINETY PER CENT SORRY SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT UP TO 
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND JERSEY AND GUERNSEY HAVE 
NO PROTECTION SCHEME WHATSOEVER 
HOWEVER FRANCE ACTUALLY OFFERS 
FRENCH RESIDENTS TAX FREE SAVINGS 
ACCOUNTS AND ALSO THEIR LEVEL OF 
PROTECTION IS ONE OF THE BEST IN 
THE WORLD AT SEVENTY THOUSAND EUROS SHOULD 
MOVE HER MONEY THERE S. SHE NEEDS TO 
GET SOME ADVICE ON HER TAX POSITION 
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S NOT 
ACTUALLY GOT IT RIGHT AND SHE WOULD 
BE WELL ADVISED TO GO AND GET 
ADVICE 
WE WOULD ALWAYS SAY TAKE ADVICE TIPS FROM THE TELLY NEVER MAKE A 
BIG DECISION PACE BASTED ON ONE 
THING YOU HEAR BUT YOU ARE GIVING 
A STRONG CLUE GET GOOD ADVICE AND 
GET IT NOW 
INDEED SHE'S NOT THE 
ONLY PERSON IN THAT POSITION THERE 
ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN 
THAT POSITION IN FACT FRANCE 
OPENED UP AN ENGLISH SPEAKING TAX 
OFFICE LAST YEAR TO HELP EX PATS 
JAMES MONK WHEN THE NEW RULES 
COVERING C. G. T. COME IN WOULD IT BE 
BETTER TO INVEST IN GROWTH FUNDS 
RATHER THAN INCOME FUNDS 
IT'S A 
CLASSIC DON'T LET THE TAX TAIL WAG 
THE INVESTMENT DOG IT'S A CASE OF 
INVESTING IN THINGS THAT ARE 
APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR NEEDS WHILE 
THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX MAY BE 
ATTRACTIVE FOR MORE PEOPLE BUT IT 
MAY BE AN INAPPROPRIATE INVESTMENT 
FOR YOU 
YOU ARE INVESTING TO GET 
PROFIT NOT JUST AS AN END TO REDUCE 
THE AMOUNT OF TAX INDEED BEFORE INDEED BEFORE YOU GO OUR DIRECTOR WOULD LIKE TO 
HEAR YOU VOICING UP COMMERCIAL 
FOR BUBBLE BATH HE HAS FALLEN IN 
LOVE WITH YOUR VOICE THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH SHE'S SO TERRIFIED BY 
THAT PROSPECT SHE SAID 
ABSOLUTELY NOT 
IT IT MIGHT BE A 
GOOD SIDELINE 
IF YOU COULD STAY 
BEHIND AFTERWARDS WE WILL PUT THAT 
ON NEXT WEEK 
DONNA BRADSHAW AND BUBBLE BATH 
COMING UP ON MONDAY'S PROGRAMME 
HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND
