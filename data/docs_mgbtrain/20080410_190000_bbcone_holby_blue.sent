IF WE'VE HAD IT OVER THREE MONTHS AND CAN'T TRACE THE OWNER IT GOES FOR DISPOSAL 
SEEMS SUCH A SHAME WITHOUT A CURRENT ADDRESS THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO 
YES SIR HELLO I HAD A CALL FROM YOUR CUSTODY SERGEANT ABOUT TREY GABRIEL

WE HAVE A SEAN BURROWS TO SEE YOU THANK YOU BYE 
NOW WHAT YOU UP TO 
I THOUGHT I MIGHT TRY A BIT OF DETECTIVE WORK WELL YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
SO ALL WE'VE REALLY GOT TO GO ON IS THE NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE CALL SO FAR 
WE'VE DRAWN A BLANK WITH C. C. T. V. I'VE TALKED TO THE OFFICERS WALKING DAS'S ROUTE 
THEY'RE GOING TO GO OVER IT AGAIN BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HELP WE NEED A WITNESS 
AND FAST THE MEDIA ARE GOING TO BE ALL OVER THIS 
THEY'LL HEAR THE NAME PRADIP DAS AND FIRST ASSUMPTION WILL BE THAT IT'S A RACIST ATTACK 
WE DON'T WANT A COMMUNITY RELATIONS NIGHTMARE 
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO RECENT RACE RELATED VIOLENCE BUT IT SEEMS THE BROCKLEY'S BEEN QUIET LATELY 
I'VE FOLLOWED UP A SPATE OF ROBBERIES BUT NONE OF THEM WERE AS VICIOUS SO THIS WAS PERSONAL 
SOMEONE WITH A SPECIFIC GRUDGE AGAINST DAS SEEMS DOUBTFUL 
HIS PARENTS RECKON HE'S A CLEAN LIVING HARD WORKING BOY 
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE MUM AND DAD'S WORD FOR IT 
WE'LL TALK TO THE PEOPLE HE WORKS WITH FRIENDS TEACHERS SEE IF THAT THROWS ANYTHING UP GOOD 
JEN ANYTHING SORRY NOT SO FAR BUT HERE'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN 
I'VE GOT ONE IN FOR JOYRIDING TREY GABRIEL FIFTEEN RECENTLY EXCLUDED FROM SCHOOL FOR A STABBING INCIDENT 
THE CAR HE WAS IN WAS REPORTED STOLEN FROM THE BROCKLEY ESTATE JUST BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT 
HOW CLOSE TO THE SCENE OF THE ATTACK 
TWO STREETS AWAY THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTH A CHAT 
GOT TO START SOMEWHERE SEAN BURROWS IS AT THE FRONT DESK TREY IS ONE OF HIS 
OH YEAH WHO'S HE SEAN'S A GOOD GUY 
RUNS THE YOUTH PROJECT ON PRINCE'S STREET 
MAN HAS THE PATIENCE OF A SAINT 
SO CAN YOU BOYS TAKE IT FROM HERE ABSOLUTELY 
YOU WERE A BIT HARDCORE EARLIER SORRY THE ARREST 
ALMOST BROKE THAT KID'S ARM NO HE RESISTED YEAH YEAH IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM NO NO COURSE NOT 
GOOD LET'S GO AND CAN YOU NOT DRIVE ROUND THE HOUSES THIS TIME 
O. K. BUT WE'RE STOPPING AT A CAFF I'M STARVING FINE 
I CAN SEE THAT THE TEXT MESSAGES ARE VERY DISTURBING 
TOO RIGHT I'M A NERVOUS WRECK 
THE PROBLEM IS TINA YOU HAVE NO PROOF THAT THEY WERE SENT BY YOUR EX PARTNER 
I KNOW IT WAS HIM EITHER THAT OR THAT SKANK HE'S MOVED IN WITH 
THEY'RE THREE DOORS DOWN TALK ABOUT RUBBING MY FACE IN IT 
YOU SAID YOURSELF THE MOBILE NUMBER ISN'T ONE YOU RECOGNISE 
WELL HE'S PROBABLY GOT HIMSELF A PAY AS YOU GO 
TRYING TO COVER HIS TRACKS 
RIGHT SO COME ON I MEAN THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE HERE FOR ISN'T IT 
I'M THE VICTIM IN THIS NOT HER SHE'S DRIVING US MENTAL 
YOU AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND SHANIA 
RIGHT YOU STILL LIVE ON THE SAME STREET AS TINA FREEMAN 
YEAH AND SINCE I MOVED IN ALL WE'VE HAD IS NON STOP HASSLE NUISANCE CALLS A ROCK THROUGH THE WINDOW 
SHE'S EVEN PUT A BLEEDIN' GREAT SCRATCH DOWN THE SIDE OF MY IMPREZA 
AND YOU LOT'VE BEEN AS MUCH USE AS A FART IN A HURRICANE YOU JUST SAY WE CAN'T PROVE IT WAS HER 
SO WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE IT IS IT'S OBVIOUS INNIT 
SHE STILL WANTS ME 
SO WHAT YOU GOT HERE WELL YOU'RE OUT TO GET US AND YOU'LL STOP AT NOTHING TILL WE'RE DEAD 
M. M. M. WELL WE RECKON YOU CAN'T ACCEPT IT'S OVER 
ON ACCOUNT OF US BEING A TOTAL STUD AND YOU'LL GO TO ANY LENGTHS TO KEEP THE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION OPEN 
SO TINA SENT THE TEXT MESSAGES TO HERSELF THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS 
AND TRASHING HIS CAR AND EMPTYING A WHEELIE BIN IN HIS GARDEN 
SO ONE CRIME REPORT FOR THE ALLEGED THREATS TO KILL ONE FOR THE COUNTER ALLEGATIONS 
MORE LIKE FIVE PROBABLY HAVE TO WRITE 'EM UP AS SEPARATE INCIDENTS 
THEN WE'VE GOT TO INTERVIEW SUSPECTS TAKE WITNESS STATEMENTS 
NOT TO MENTION THE LOVELY SHANIA 
WHO OH THE SKANK YEAH 
THEN THERE'S THE PAPERWORK SO WE CAN RECOVER THE TEXT MESSAGES FOR ANALYSIS 
SO ALL IN ALL ABOUT FIFTEEN HOURS WORK AT LEAST 
FANTASTIC CAN WE AT LEAST SEND THEM HOME FOR NOW 
BECAUSE IF I HAVE TO HEAR ANY MORE ABOUT TINA'S MENTAL DISTRESS 
I'M GONNA START SENDING HER DEATH THREATS FAIR ENOUGH 
OH TELL ME NEIL 
IS THIS WHAT YOU MEANT BY MAKING A DIFFERENCE 
THIS IS A TOTAL FIT UP I'M SERIOUS 
AIN'T GOT NOTHING ON ME 
TREY GIVE US A BREAK O. K. THEY SAW YOU GETTING OUT OF THE CAR 
YEAH I KNOW BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS STOLEN 
THEY JUST CAME ROUND TO MY PLACE SAID DID I WANT TO GO FOR A RIDE HONEST RIGHT 
I DON'T GET IT YOU'VE BEEN DOING REALLY WELL LATELY 
THEY KEEP GIVING ME GRIEF ABOUT YOU GUYS AND THE PROJECT I WANT 'EM OFF MY BACK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS 
YEAH YEAH I KNOW PEER PRESSURE BEING YOUR OWN BOSS RESPECTING YOUR OWN WHATEVER 
I GET IT WELL CLEARLY YOU DON'T 
TREY GABRIEL HELLO I'M D. S. FRENCH 
THIS IS DI KEENAN HI THERE WE JUST NEED TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS 
I WEREN'T DRIVING AND I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS STOLEN 
I SWEAR ON MY LIFE YEAH YEAH O. K. 
LET'S FORGET THAT FOR NOW YOU'LL BE FORMALLY INTERVIEWED LATER 
LET'S TALK ABOUT ANOTHER INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT 
DON'T LOOK AT ME I AIN'T DONE NOTHING 
ENOUGH O. K. 
A YOUNG BOY CALLED PRADIP DAS WAS VICIOUSLY ATTACKED LAST NIGHT ON LINK STREET 
THE CAR YOU WERE IN THIS MORNING WAS STOLEN AT AROUND THE SAME TIME TWO STREETS AWAY FROM LINK STREET 
SO TO MY MIND THAT MAKES YOU A POSSIBLE WITNESS 
HANG ON I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT NO ATTACK 
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING OR SEE ANYTHING NO ONE RUNNING AWAY FROM THE SCENE NO ONE CALLING FOR HELP 
NO I TOLD YOU I WASN'T EVEN ROUND THERE LAST NIGHT 
WHAT ABOUT THE MATES IN THE CAR THEY WEREN'T THERE LAST NIGHT EITHER 
NO I MEAN I DON'T KNOW MAYBE 
HOW ABOUT YOU GIVE ME THEIR NAMES SO WE CAN ASK THEM 
DON'T REMEMBER YOU DON'T REMEMBER THEIR NAMES I'D NOT MET THEM BEFORE HAD I 
O. K. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WASTE ON THIS 
SO HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A LONG HARD THINK IN THE CELLS AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TRY ALL THIS AGAIN 
HOW ARE THINGS GOING WITH THE PROJECT 
I HEAR YOU GOT SOME BIG GRANT 
YEAH 
YEAH ABOUT HALF WHAT WE NEEDED BUT IT'S A START 
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK HE KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ATTACK 
GIVEN THAT HE'S THE CLOSEST THING WE HAVE TO A WITNESS AT THE MOMENT I'M PRAYING HE DOES 
IT'S JUST UNDER ALL THAT BRAVADO HE'S BASICALLY A GOOD KID 
EASILY LED BUT HE STEERS CLEAR OF VIOLENCE AND IN GENERAL SO DO THE KIDS HE HANGS OUT WITH 
WASN'T HE EXCLUDED FOR INVOLVEMENT IN A STABBING 
WELL ANOTHER BOY STARTED WAVING A PENKNIFE AROUND 
TREY WASN'T CHARGED HE WAS JUST IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME 
MAYBE HE MAKES A HABIT OF THAT 
POSSIBLY BUT I DON'T THINK STRONG ARM TACTICS ARE THE WAY TO GO 
IF YOU GO IN ASSUMING THAT HE'S GUILTY 
LET'S NOT GET CARRIED AWAY HE WAS CAUGHT RUNNING AWAY FROM A STOLEN CAR 
HE'S STILL FACING CHARGES ON THAT ONE STILL I DO FIND KIDS TEND TO LIVE UP OR DOWN TO EXPECTATIONS 
JUST GIVE HIM A CHANCE YEAH LOOK SEAN I GET WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM 
BUT THE ONLY KID I CAN AFFORD TO CARE ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS LYING UNCONSCIOUS 
IN HOSPITAL BECAUSE SOMEONE DECIDED TO STAMP ON HIS HEAD 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT AND THE LETTER WAS ADDRESSED TO BETTY ROSS 
NO I KNOW SHE DOESN'T LIVE THERE BUT I'M TRYING TO LOCATE MARGARET BENNETT WHO SENT THE LETTER 
YES 
OH RIGHT BUT IT'S NOT YOU 
O. K. WELL SORRY TO BOTHER YOU 
THANK YOU BYE 
HI CAN I SPEAK TO MARGARET BENNETT PLEASE 
ABOUT TIME SORRY WE'RE MEANT TO BE DOING HOUSE TO HOUSE ALL RIGHT SORRY 
IT'S JUST THE BIRD HEARD ABOUT ROBERT 
SAID HE USED TO POP BY ALL THE TIME SHE WAS PROPER GUTTED 
O. K. JUST STOP GOING ON ABOUT HIM ALL RIGHT 
I'M NOT THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE MENTIONED HIS NAME JUST DON'T LUCE 
IS THAT YOUR PHONE WHAT NO 
SO WHOSE IS IT THEN I DON'T KNOW GIVE ME A SECOND 
WHAT 
WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE TO YOU 
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM WHO'S THE ONLY PASSENGER WE'VE HAD TODAY 
TELL US ABOUT THIS VIDEO CLIP SENT TO YOUR PHONE 
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 
LET ME JOG YOUR MEMORY IT CONTAINS FOOTAGE OF THE ATTACK ON PRADIP DAS 
THE ATTACK YOU SAID YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT I DON'T I DIDN'T FILM IT 
SOMEONE SENT IT TO ME WHO I DON'T KNOW PEOPLE SEND ME STUFF ALL THE TIME 
HOW ABOUT YOUR MYSTERY FRIENDS WHO PICKED YOU UP IN A STOLEN CAR YOU DIDN'T KNOW WAS STOLEN 
I DIDN'T RECOGNISE THE NUMBER IT COULD BE ANYONE'S 
WHAT ABOUT THE BOY IN THE VIDEO THE BOY KICKING PRADIP DAS SENSELESS DO YOU RECOGNISE HIM 
NO HOW COULD I YOU'VE SEEN IT YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE HIS FACE 
I'M NOT PSYCHIC TREY FOR GOD'S SAKE A BOY NEARLY DIED THIS ISN'T JOY RIDING OR GRAFFITI 
IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP THE POLICE BACK OFF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON MY SIDE 
I A. M. ON YOUR SIDE BUT YOU KNOW THAT STAYING ON THE PROJECT DEPENDS ON YOU STAYING OUT OF TROUBLE 
YOU'RE ALREADY ON A WARNING YOU KNOW WHAT SCREW YOU AND SCREW YOUR PROJECT 
I'M DONE WITH THIS 
DI KEENAN CAN I HAVE A WORD 
THE BOY'S A POSSIBLE WITNESS AND HE'S IN POSSESSION OF VIDEO FOOTAGE OF THE ATTACK 
HE MUST KNOW ONE OF THE PERPETRATORS BUT HE WAS BROUGHT IN ON SUSPICION OF TAKING WITHOUT CONSENT 
YOU CAN'T HOLD HIM INDEFINITELY BECAUSE HE MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT ANOTHER CASE 
WE'LL BE CRUCIFIED HE DOES KNOW SOMETHING 
DO YOU THINK KEEPING HIM IN CUSTODY WILL MAKE HIM MORE CO OPERATIVE 
YES IT HASN'T SO FAR CAN WE EVEN PLACE HIM AT THE SCENE 
NO NOT YET PERHAPS WE SHOULD FOCUS ON GETTING SOMETHING FROM THE PHONE FOOTAGE 
THEN BRING HIM BACK IN WHEN WE'VE GOT MORE AMMUNITION 
WE ARE DEALING WITH A MINOR IT MAKES SENSE TO PLAY THIS CAREFULLY YES SIR 
JOHN PRADIP DAS HAS REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS GO
