BONE'S ADVICE 
HE PRODUCED THE 
RECORD 
HE DID AND HE REACHED ALL RECORD OVER THE PLACE WITH DIFFERENT FOLKS 
THAT GREW UP DIFFERENT WAYS IT'S 
TURNED INTO AN INTERESTING THING 
WHEN YOU TOURED PRESUMABLY WHEN 
ROBERT TOURED HE WOULD BE THE SORT 
OF PERSON THAT MIGHT CHUCK

OH THE NIGHT IS GROWING COLDER 
AND THE STARS HAVE LOST THEIR SHINE 
AND I HAVE BEEN FORSAKEN 
BY EVERYTHING I THOUGHT WAS MINE 
FOR IN THE DARKEST HOUR 
WHEN THE FINAL STORY IS TOLD 
NO MATTER HOW BRIGHT I GLITTER BABY 
I CAN NEVER BE GOLD 
YOU GAVE UP YOUR FINEST TREASURE 
FOR THE ONE YOU SAW IN ME 
BUT HOW COULD I KNOW THE MEASURE 
OF ALL YOU NEEDED ME TO BE 
THOUGH I CAME WITH SWEET INTENTIONS 
FOR MY POCKETS COULD NOT HOLD 
NO MATTER HOW BRIGHT I GLITTERED BABY 
I COULD NEVER BE GOLD 
I FINALLY GAVE UP COUNTING 
THE WAYS YOU SAID I LET YOU DOWN 
WHEN I FELL INTO THAT RIVER 
OH RETURN AND WATCH ME DROWN 
OH I COULD SPARKLE LIKE A DIAMOND 
HAVE SILVER LINED MY SOUL 
BUT NO MATTER HOW BRIGHT I GLITTERED 
I COULD NEVER BE GOLD 
YOU LOOKED SO HIGH AND LONGED FOR HEAVEN 
I TRIED SO HARD TO SHOW THE WAY 
ALTHOUGH I FLEW ON WINGS OF ANGELS 
MY FEET WERE ALWAYS MADE OF CLAY 
I COULD COME TRAILING CLOUDS OF GLORY 
NO MATTERED HOW BRIGHT I GLITTERED BABY 
I COULD NEVER BE GOLD 
NO MATTER HOW BRIGHT I GLITTERED BABY 
I COULD NEVER BE GOLD
