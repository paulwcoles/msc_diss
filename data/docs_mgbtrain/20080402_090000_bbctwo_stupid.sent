TUPID 
YOUNG FOLKS BY PETER BJORN AND JOHN 
I'M VASIL HERE TO TALK ABOUT IMAGINATION 
EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE IMAGINATION 
IT HELPS WHEN READING BOOKS WITH NO PICTURES 
IT ALSO HELPS WITH ARTWORK AND WRITING STORIES 
I USED MY IMAGINATION TO PAINT THIS PICTURE 
I PAINTED THE BACKGROUND WITH DIFFERENT PAINTS 
I CRUSHED SHELLS AND STUCK ON AND THEN MORE SHELLS AROUND THE EDGES 
CHILDREN HAVE MORE IMAGINATION THAN ADULTS BECAUSE AS THEY GROW OLDER 
THEY START WORRYING ABOUT GSCES AND A LEVELS 
J. K. ROWLING IN ONE OF THE FEW ADULTS WITH IMAGINATION 
I THINK MY GRANDPARENTS HAVE IMAGINATION 
I ENJOY WRITING AND READING BOOKS WITH NO PICTURES 
AND THEN HE IMPLEMENTS THE STORIES HE READS 
AND WRITES POEMS AND STORIES ABOUT IT 
WE LIKE VASIL'S IMAGINATION 
HE'S GOOD AT DESCRIBING THINGS LIKE DRAGONS AND WITCHES 
WE USED TO TAKE HIM TO MALAYSIA AND SINGAPORE AND SHOW HIM THE JUNGLES 
I WANT TO BE A WRITER BECAUSE THEY USE A LOT OF IMAGINATION 
TO MAKE GOOD STORYLINES AND PLOTS 
I'M VASIL'S SECOND OLDEST SISTER 
IF HE DOESN'T HAVE STUFF TO PAINT WITH HE'LL USE MY MAKEUP 
ESPECIALLY LIPSTICK HE DOES SCULPTURES AND COLLAGES 
WHEN I DRAW WITH LIPSTICK IT'S A BIT HARD 
BUT AFTER A WHILE YOU GET USED TO IT 
I LIKED THE WAY SHE USED HER IMAGINATION 
TO MAKE THE GAME QUIDDITCH THAT'S REALLY USING YOUR IMAGINATION 
EVEN I COULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT 
IF I CLICK MY FINGERS THE WORD SHOULD FLIP 
IF I CLICK MY FINGERS 
THE WORD SHOULD TURN UPSIDE DOWN 
THAT'S IMAGINATION FOR YOU 
I'M VASIL AND THAT'S WHY I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE MORE IMAGINATION
