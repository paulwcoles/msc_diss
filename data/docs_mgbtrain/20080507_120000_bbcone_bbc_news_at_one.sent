GOVERNMENT REJECTS SCIENTIFIC 
ADVICE ADVICE THE DRUG IS TO BE UPGRADED AS A 
MORE DANGEROUS DRUG FROM CLASS C. 
TO CLASS B. ONE MILLION PEOPLE ARE 
HOMELESS FOLLOWING THE CYCLONE IN 
BURMA THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY 
GOVERNMENT IS URGED TO OPEN THE 
BORDERS TO AID 
THE B. B. C. UNDERSTANDS THE MAN KILLED 
AFTER AN EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE WITH 
POLICE IN LONDON WAS A BARRISTER 
WHO SPECIALISED IN FAMILY LAW 
BARACK OBAMA PULLS FURTHER AHEAD OF 
HILLARY CLINTON IN THE RACE TO 
BECOME THE DEMOCRATIC CHOICE FOR 
THE WHITE HOUSE 
ON B. B. C. LONDON ONE IN FIVE POST 
PFFICE BRANCHES WILL CLOSE IN 
LONDON FROM NEXT MONTH AND THE 
CAPITAL'S NEW MAYOR BORIS JOHNSON 
ANNOUNCES PLANS TO BAN ALCOHOL ON 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
GOOD AFTERNOON THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
REJECTED OFFICIAL ADVICE AND 
RECLASSIFIED CANNABIS AS A MORE 
DANGEROUS DRUG THE HOME SECRETARY 
HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THE DRUG WILL BE 
UPGRADED FROM CLASS C. THAT'S THE 
LOWEST CLASSIFICATION TO CLASS B. 
THAT'S DESPITE A REPORT BY THE 
ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE MISUSE OF 
DRUGS WHICH SAID CANNABIS SHOULD 
STAY IN THE LOWEST CATEGORY WELL 
THE HOME SECRETARY JACKIE SMITH 
TOLD THE COMMONS JUST NOW SHE IS 
ACTING BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO 
RISK THE FUTURE HEALTH OF YOUNG 
PEOPLE PEOPLE CANNABIS CAMPAIGNER CHRIS BALDWIN 
PREPARES A JOINT FOUR YEARS AGO 
THE DRUGS LEGAL CATEGORY CHANGED 
FROM CLASS B. TO CLASS C. IT'S NOW 
IN THE SAME GROUP AS DRUGS LIKE 
ANABOLIC STEROIDS BUT THIS 
AFTERNOON TO CHRIS BALDWIN'S DISMAY 
THE HOME SECRETARY DECIDED TO MOVE 
IT BACK UP AGAIN 
THERE IS MR. 
SPEAKER A COMPELLING CASE FOR US TO 
ACT NOW RATHER THAN RISK THE 
FUTURE HEALTH OF YOUNG PEOPLE 
WHERE THERE IS A CLEAR AND SERIOUS 
PROBLEM BUT DOUBT ABOUT THE 
POTENTIAL HARM THAT WILL BE CAUSED 
WE MUST ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION 
AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC L. MAKE NO 
APOLOGY FOR THAT L. AM NOT PREPARED 
TO WAIT AND SEE 
TO SHOW HOW EASY IT IS NOW IS TO 
BUY CANNABIS IN SOME PARTS OF 
LONDON WE HAVE COME TO CAMDEN ON AN 
EARLY SUMMER EVENING WITH HIDDEN CAMERA 
I HAVE SKUNK WITHIN CAMERA WITHIN MINUTES OUR RESEARCHER WAS BEING 
OFFERED A SKUNK HIGH STRENGTH 
VERSION OF CANNABIS 
HOW MUCH DO 
YOU WANT TO PAY 
I DON'T WANT TO 
PAY TWENTY 
GIVE ME FIFTEEN THEN THE THE CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE IN THE HIGH 
STREET IN FULL PUBLIC VIEW 
DESPITE ITS READY AVAILABILITY 
CANNABIS USE HAS BEEN GOING DOWN 
SINCE RECLASSIFICATION 
EVEN IN THE IMPORTANT ELEVEN TO FIFTEEN AGE 
GROUP IT HAS DROPPED FROM ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR PER CENT TO 
TEN PER CENT AND THE GOVERNMENT IS IGNORING 
ITS EXPERT PANEL WHICH SAYS 
CANNABIS SHOULD STAY IN CLASS C. WE WE RECOMMENDED ON THE BASIS OF ITS 
HARMLESSNESS THAT IT SHOULD REMAIN 
A CLASS C. DRUG HARMFULNESS 
IT WAS MORE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE HARM WITH THINGS LIKE VALIUM 
WHY ARE MINISTERS DISREGARDING 
THEIR EXPERTS WELL HERE AT THE 
FORENSIC SCIENCE SERVICE THEY 
TIMES' STRONGER THAN IT USED TO BE 
THIS IS BECAUSE MUCH OF IT IS SKUNK 
GROWN IN BRITAIN AND THE HOME 
OFFICE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT 
CANNABIS CAUSES SCHIZOPHRENIA 
ALTHOUGH RESEARCH SHOWS THIS IS 
RARE RARE LET'S TALK TO COLIN BLAKEMORE A 
PROFESSOR OF NEUROSCIENCE AT OXFORD 
UNIVERSITY AND SITS ON THE U. K. DRUG 
POLICY COMMISSION 
POLICY COMMISSION IS THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO 
IGNORE ITS EXPERT PANEL THE RIGHT 
DECISION 
WELL I THINK IT SETS A DECISION VERY UNFORTUNATE PRECEDENT FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT ATTITUDE TO EVIDENCE 
BASED POLICY WHEN THE LABOUR PARTY 
CAME IN IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IT MADE A STRONG 
COMMITMENT TO THE USE OF EVIDENCE 
TO DETERMINE POLICY ONE CAN 
IMAGINE SITUATIONS WHERE IT WOULD 
BE VERY REASONABLE TO OVERRULE 
EXPERT OPINION IF FOR INSTANCE 
WHAT IS RECOMMENDED IS JUST TOO 
EXPENSIVE BUT THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO 
BE THE CASE FOR THE 
RECLASSIFICATION OF CANNABIS IT 
SEEMS TO BE CONCERNED WITH SENDING 
MESSAGES I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE 
BEING SENT TO OR WHAT THE EFFECT IS 
EXPECTED TO BE 
I SUPPOSE THE 
MESSAGE FROM THE HOME SECRETARY 
JACQUI SMITH AND SHOW SAID THIS TO 
M. P.'S IS WE ARE DEALING WITH THE 
SORT OF DRUG THAN THE SORT OF DRUG 
ON THE STREETS TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO 
IT IS MUCH MORE POTENT TWO TO 
THREE TIMES' STRONGER AND THAT'S 
THE REASON WHY IT NEEDS TO BE 
UPGRADE TO A MORE DANGEROUS DRUG 
SHE SAYS 
I THINK IT IS INTERESTING 
THAT THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE WAS 
ASKED AGAIN TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE IN 
JULY LAST YEAR WHEN THERE WAS A 
GREAT DEAL OF HYSTERIA AMONGST SOME 
NEWSPAPERS WITH ALLEGATION IT IS 
HAD INCREASED BY TWENTY OR THIRTY TIMES IN 
STRENGTH THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE 
GIVEN THE CONTENT WAS ABOUT SEVEN PER CENT 
BEFORE IT IS APPROXIMATELY DOUBLED 
FROM THE AVERAGE SAMPLES THAT ARE 
BEING LOOKED AT WHAT WE KNOW FROM 
A STUDY IN HOLLAND IS THAT AT LEAST 
SOME USERS TAKE THE AMOUNT IT GET 
THE EFFECTS THAT THEY WANT RATHER 
LIKE DRINKING SMALL AMOUNTS OF 
WHISKEY RATHER THAN LARGE AMOUNTS 
OF BEER SO IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT 
THE SMALL CHANGE IN STRENGTH WILL 
TRANSLATE DIRECTLY INTO HIGHER 
EXPOSURES 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH EXPOSURES INTERNATIONAL AID AGENCIES ARE 
STARTING TO GET SUPPLIES INTO BURMA 
WHERE AT LEAST TWENTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN KILLED BY A DEVASTATING 
CYCLONE AT LEAST FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE 
MISSING ANOTHER MILLION ARE LEFT 
HOMELESS THESE PICTURES WE WILL 
SHOW THEM TO YOU NOW RTAKEN BY IN A 
SA THEY SHOW THE EXTENT OF THE 
DAMAGE IN THE IRRAWADDY DELTA 
WE WILL SHOW THESE PICTURES TO YOU 
NOW TAKEN BY NASA 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN 
BURMA ARE ENDURING THEIR FIFTH DAY 
CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
STRANDED ACROSS THE IRRAWADDY DELTA 
WAITING FOR RELIEF INTERNATIONAL 
AID HAS BEEN TRICKLING INTO THE 
COUNTRY BUT NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE 
KNOWN TO BE DEAD MANY MORE ARE 
MISSING AND PERHAPS ONE MILLION ARE 
WITHOUT FOOD AND SHELTER 
GETTING IN FRESH WATER IS GOING TO 
BE CRUCIAL THE SALT WATER TIDAL 
SURGE AND THE DEAD BODIES IT LEFT 
BEHIND WILL HAVE BEGUN POISONING 
THE NORMAL WATER SUPPLIES AND THE 
TRUE SCALE OF THIS DISASTER IS YET 
TO EMERGE MANY ROADS ARE STILL 
BLOCKED BY FALLEN TREES AND DEBRIS 
THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE 
RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THIS 
CATASTROPHICY BUT IT IS STILL 
RELUCTANT TO OPEN THE DOOR FULLY TO 
THE INTERNATIONAL AID TEAMS WAITING 
OUTSIDE 
WE HAVE IN DUBAI A OUTSIDE PREPOSITIONING UNIT WHERE WE HAVE 
THOUSANDS OF TONNES OF TENTAGE 
KITS TO HELP PEOPLE RECOVER AND 
THAT'S READY TO FLY IN THE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS TRYING 
TO ENCOURAGE THE COUNTRY'S LEADERS 
TO OPEN UP AND ALLOW IN AID AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLE 
IT IS A HUGE HUGE 
PROBLEM AND IT WOULD STRETCH ANY 
GOVERNMENT WE ARE WORKING ON IT 
IT IS EASING BUT IT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT THAT ACCESS HAS OPENED UP 
ENTIRE VILLAGES AND TOWNS WERE 
WIPED OUT BY THE TIDAL SURGE 
CAUSED BY SATURDAY'S CYCLONE THE 
FEAR IS THAT THE LONGER THE AID 
GROUPS ARE DELAYED THE WORST THE 
RISK OF DISEASE TAKING HOLD IN A 
COUNTRY WITH AN ALREADY FRAGILE 
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
IT IS FIVE DAYS 
SINCE THE AREA WAS DECIMATED BY THE 
CYCLONE GETTING AID TO THESE 
PEOPLE NOW MAY LITERALLY BE A 
MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH 
THE B. B. C. UNDERSTANDS THAT THE MAN 
KILLED AFTER AN EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE 
WITH POLICE IN CHELSEA IN WEST 
LONDON YESTERDAY IS MARK SAUNDERS 
HE WAS A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD BARRISTER WHO 
SPECIALISED IN FAMILY LAW AN 
INVESTIGATION HAS BEGUN INTO THE 
SHOOTING DURING A FIVE HOUR STAND 
OFF WITH ARMED OFFICERS IT IS NOT 
YET CLEAR WHO FIRED THE FATAL SHOT 
GUNFIRE IN CHELSEA WHEN POLICE 
ARRIVED AT THIS HOUSE YESTERDAY 
AFTERNOON THEY FOUND MARK SAUNDERS 
A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD BARRISTER FIRING 
SHOTGUN FROM HIS SECOND FLOOR 
WINDOWS THE FIRST SHOTS WERE HEARD 
AT AROUND FIVE HUNDRED P. M. BUT A SIEGE THEN 
DEVELOPED AND THERE WERE AT LEAST 
TWO MORE EXCHANGES OF FIRE BETWEEN 
MR. SAUNDERS AND THE POLICE DURING 
THE EVENING 
I SAW THE POLICE GOING 
INTO THE HOUSE I HAVE NOW WORKED 
OUT BACKS ON TO THE PROPERTY THAT 
THE GUNMAN WAS IN TEN MINUTES 
AFTER THAT THERE WERE SIX OR MAYBE 
SEVEN DEFINITE LOUD BANGS VERY 
DELIBERATE BANG BANG BANG ONE 
AFTER ANOTHER AFTER THAT THERE 
WAS SILENCE 
WHEN OFFICERS ENTERED 
THE HOUSE THEY FOUND MR. SAUNDERS 
INSIDE ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO 
RESUSCITATE HIM BUT HE DIED OF HIS 
INJURIES THE IPCC THE INDEPENDENT 
POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMITTEE ARE NOW 
INVESTIGATING A POSTMORTEM ON MR. 
SAUNDERS IS BEING CARRIED OUT THIS 
AFTERNOON AFTERNOON THE IPCC SAY THEY ARE NOT DRAWING 
ANY FIRM CONCLUSIONS YET ABOUT 
EXACTLY WHAT WENT ON HERE YESTERDAY 
AFTERNOON AFTERNOON WHAT THEY WILL HAVE TO DECIDE 
THOUGH IS WHETHER MR. SAUNDERS WAS 
SHOT BY ARMED POLICE OR WHETHER HE 
TURNED HIS OWN GUN ON HIMSELF 
AUSTRIAN PROSECUTORS HAVE BEGUN 
QUESTIONING JOSEF FRITZL WHO 
IMPRISONED AND RAPED HIS DAUGHTER 
IN THE CELLAR AT THE FAMILY HOME 
FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT HASED A 
MID ITS SHORTCOMINGS INTO ITS 
INVESTIGATION INTO ELISABETH 
FRITZL'S DISAPPEARANCE TO THE 
UNITED STATES AND THERE IS A BATTLE 
OVER WHO WILL WIN THE DEMOCRATIC 
PRESIDENTAL NOMINATION DESPITE THE 
RESULTS OF TWO IMPORTANT PRIMARIES 
WHICH INCREASED BARACK OBAMA'S LEAD 
OVER HILLARY CLINTON IN NORTH 
CAROLINA OBAMA WON FIFTY SIX PER CENT OF THE VOTE 
COMPARED TO FORTY TWO PER CENT FOR HILLARY CLINTON 
IN THE MID WESTERN STATE OF INDIANA 
CLINTON WON FIFTY ONE PER CENT AND OBAMA GOT FORTY NINE PER CENT 
HE HADN'T WON A BIG STATE FOR MORE 
THAN TWO MONTHS HE HAS BEEN UNDER 
FIRE AND ON THE DEFENSIVE BUT 
BARACK OBAMA'S CONVINCING WIN IN 
NORTH CAROLINA HAS CHANGED THE MOOD 
WHY BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON HAD 
RAISED THE STAKES 
THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE SAYING THAT 
NORTH CAROLINA WOULD BE A GAME 
CHANGER IN THIS ECTION BUT TODAY 
WHAT NORTH CAROLINA DECIDED IS 
THAT THE ONLY GAME THAT NEEDS 
CHANGING IS THE ONE IN WASHINGTON 
D. C. D. C. ONCE AGAIN THEY ARE SHOUTING WITH 
CONVICTION IN THE END IT WASN'T 
JUST AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO TURNED 
OUT IN DROVES FORTY PER CENT OF THE WHITE 
VOTE IN NORTH CAROLINA BACKED 
BARACK OBAMA THE MOMENTUM HAS 
SWUNG BACK IN HIS FAVOUR 
CONTRAST THAT WITH HILLARY CLINTON 
YES SHE DECLARED VICTORY IN 
INDIANA 
THANKS TO YOU IT'S FULL INDIANA SPEED ON TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
IT WAS HOWEVER BY THE NARROWEST 
MARGIN AND THEN LOOK AT HER 
HUSBAND'S FACE AND LISTEN TO HER 
WORDS IS THIS CANDIDATE WHO 
REALLY BELIEVES SHE CAN WIN NO NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I WILL WORK 
FOR THE NOMINEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY BECAUSE WE MUST WIN IN 
NOVEMBER 
FOR NOW THE TRENCH NOVEMBER WARFARE CONTINUES BUT BARACK 
OBAMA'S LEAD LOOKS INCREASINGLY 
UNASSAILAL AND FOR HILLARY CLINTON 
THE QUESTION ONCE AGAIN FOR HOW 
MUCH LONGER 
JONATHAN BEALE WITH THAT ROFRPLT 
LIVE WITH THAT ROFRPLT LIVE TO 
OUR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT D. 
WITH THAT REPORT 
PICKING UP 
LONG CAN 
HILLARY CLINTON KEEP FIGHTING IF 
THE MOMENT UP 
IS AGAINST HER AT AT THE MOMENT SHE CONTINUES 
TO SAY SHE IS GOING TO SEE THIS RIGHT THROUGH TO 
THE END SHE IS GOING TO GO INTO THE NEXT VOTES IN WEST VIRGINIA 
KENTUCKY AND THEN TO POUR PUERTO 
RICO AND ELSEWHERE THE MOOD IN 
WASHINGTON AT THE MOMENT IS THAT 
THE MATHEMATICS SAYS IT ALL NOBODY 
CAN SEE A WAY NOW THAT HILLARY 
CLINTON CAN CATCH UP TO BARACK 
OBAMA AND SECURE THE NOMINATION 
BECOME THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S 
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT IT 
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT IT DOES SEEM THAT BARACK OBAMA HAS A WHOLE 
RENEWED SENSE OF MOMENTUM ABOUT HIM 
I THINK THE SENSE IN WASHINGTON IS 
THAT IT IS ALL OVER BAR THE 
SHOUTING EVEN THOUGH THERE WILL 
STILL BE QUITE A LOT OF SHOUTING TO 
COME 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT COME GORDON BROWN HAS BEEN TOLD TO GIVE 
UP P. R. AND START BEING A. P. M. BY THE 
CONSERVATIVE LEADER DAVID CAMERON 
IN THE FIRST PRIME MINISTER'S 
QUESTIONS SINCE THE LOCAL ELECTIONS 
LAST WEEK MR. CAMERON ACCUSED MR. 
BROWN OF HAVING NO COHERENT VISION 
MR. BROWN SAID THE TORIES HAD DONE 
NOTHING TO OFFER ANYONE 
AFTER TERRIBLE LOSSES AROUND THE 
COUNTRY LAST WEEK IT WAS TIME FOR 
GORDON BROWN TO FACE THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS BUT EVEN SOME OF HIS OWN 
SIDE WONDER IF TIME IS RUNNING OUT 
BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND HE WAS 
GREETED BY AN M. P. ASKING HOW LONG 
HAS HE GOT DAVID CAMERON TAUNTED 
GORDON BROWN WHO SAID HE WOULD 
LISTEN TO LEAD AFTER LABOUR'S 
DEFEATS LAST WEEK SHOULDN'T SHOULDN'T EVERYONE CONCLUDE WE HAVE A 
GOVERNMENT THAT JUST LURCHES FROM 
ONE RELAUNCH TO ANOTHER AND 
SHOULDN'T THEY CONCLUDE THAT WHAT 
IS MISSING IS WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED 
AND THAT'S A CLEAR VISION AND SOME 
STRONG LEADERSHIP FOR BRITAIN MR. MR SPEAKER THE CHOICE IN THIS COUNTRY 
IS BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS 
CREATED JOBS STABILITY GROWTH AND 
PUBLIC SERVICES AND A CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
TO OFFER THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY 
BUT THE TORY LEADER CONTINUED WITH 
HIS PERSONAL ATTACK 
THIS IS THE 
PRIME MINISTER WHO WENT ON AMERICAN 
IDOL WITH MORE MAKE UP THAN BARBARA 
CARTLAND HE SITS IN NUMBER TEN 
DOWNING STREET WAITING FOR SHAKIRA 
TO CALL AND GEORGE CLOONEY TO COME 
TO TEA L. L. HAVE ADVICE WHY DOESN'T 
HE GIVE UP THE P. R. AND START BEING 
A. P. M. 
THE VITAL QUESTION IS BETWEEN A. P. M. A LABOUR GOVERNMENT THAT DELIVERS 
AND A CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT JUST 
TALKS 
WAS ALSO 
THE LABOUR PARTY IN 
MOCKED ABOUT THE LABOUR PARTY IN SCOTLAND ITS LEADER WENDY 
ALEXANDER WITHOUT GORDON BROWN'S 
PERMISSION SAYS SHE BACKS A 
REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE IN THE 
COMMONS GORDON BROWN DENIED SHE HAD 
SAID SUCH A THING BUT IS PRIVATELY 
UNDERSTOOD TO BE FURIOUS WITH 
HEAVY LABOUR LOSSES IN ENGLAND AND 
WALES LAST WEEK THE LAST THING HE 
NEEDS IS A ROW NORTH OF THE BORDER 
TOO 
THE GOVERNMENT REJECTED SCIENTIFIC 
ADVICE AND RECLASSIFIED CANNABIS 
FROM CLASS C. TO A MORE DANGEROUS 
CLASS B. DRUG 
THE VIOLIN VIRTUOSO LEFT A 
STRUGGLER VARIOUS IN THE BACK OF A 
TAXI IN NEW YORK THERE WAS WORTH 
MORE THAN TWO MILLION 
ON B. B. C. LONDON WE MAY HAVE HAD OUR 
FAIR SHARE OF RAIN THE THAMES 
WATER UNVEILED THEIR PLANS TO 
TACKLE WATER SHORTAGES IN THE 
FUTURE FUTURE CALLS TO REMEMBER THE R. A. F. BOMBER 
COMMAND PILOTS OF WORLD WAR TWO 
THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT DOING ENOUGH 
TO READ MINUS TWO PREVENT A REPEAT OF LAST 
SUMMER'S FLOODS ACCORDING TO A 
REPORT BY M. P.'S MINISTERS HAVE 
PROMISED EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION ON FLOOD 
DEFENCES IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS BUT 
THE COMMONS ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE 
SAYS IT IS INADEQUATE 
LAST SUMMER'S FLOODS WERE 
DISASTROUS FOR MANY PEOPLE M. P.'S SAY 
THERE ARE TWO LESSONS TO BE LEARNED 
THE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION SET ASIDE BY THE 
GOVERNMENT FOR FLOOD PREVENTION IS 
INADEQUATE WHY TWO THIRDS OF LAST 
SUMMER'S FLOODS OCCURRED WHEN 
RAINWATER OVERWHELMED DRAINAGE 
SYSTEMS IN TOWNS AND CITIES BUT 
MOST OF THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT ON 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO PREVENT 
FLOODING BY RIVERS AND COASTS IT 
IS UNCLEAR WHO IS ULTIMATELY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR FLOOD PREVENTION 
M. P.'S SAY THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY 
SHOULD BE PUT IN CHARGE MICHAEL 
JACK IS THE CHAIRMAN 
WE ARE SEEING MORE EXTREME WEATHER 
EVENTS IN AREAS THAT HAVE NEVER 
BEEN THE SUBJECT OF FLOODING 
SUDDENLY FIND THEMSELVES VULNERABLE 
WHAT ARE REPORT AND OTHERS ARE 
DOING NOW IS GIVING A WAKE UP CALL 
PARTICULARLY TO PUBLIC UTILITY 
PROVIDERS TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT 
HOW ROBUST THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS 
IF WE HAVE ANOTHER REPEAT OF THE 
KIND OF SURFACE WATER FLOODING WE 
HAD LAST SUMMER 
ONE OF THE WORST HIT AREAS LAST 
YEAR WAS HULL FROM WHERE CATHERINE 
MOSTON REPORTS 
IT IS NOT THE KITCHEN SINK IT IS 
THE BAT THIS FAMILY ARE FORCED TO 
LIVE UPSTAIRS UNABLE TO COOK OR 
WASH LAUNDRY THEY ARE MAKING DO 
WITH SUCH A FEW BASICS THIS IS 
WHAT DOWNSTAIRS LOOKS LIKE THE THE DEHUMIDIFIERS HAVE BEEN IN FOR SIX 
A SEVEN WEEKS THE PLASTER WAS OFF 
BEFORE THAT TO TRY TO ENABLE THE 
BRICK WORK TO BE DRY 
IT IS NO 
WONDER THE FAMILY FEEL FRUSTRATED 
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO SAY THEY DID 
THEIR JOB PROPERLY BUT IF THEY DID 
WHY DID THE WAR TO STAY AT SUCH 
HIGH LEVEL FOR LONG PERIOD OF 
TIME THAT WATER SHOULD BE TRAINING 
THIS TRAIN IS ON A STREET THAT WAS 
FLOODING IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO 
HAVE BEEN CLEANED BEFORE AND 
CERTAINLY NOT AFTERWARDS THAT IS A 
PROBLEM HIGHLIGHTED IN TODAY'S 
REPORT WHEN HEAVY RAIN CAME IT 
WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHO WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANING WHICH 
DRAINS THIS LADY BLAMES POOR 
MAINTENANCE FOR HER FLOODING STILL 
IN A CARAVAN SHE DREADS ANY MORE 
RAIN 
IF WE ARE GOING TO GET MORE RAIN RAIN IN THE SUMMER IS IT GOING TO 
HAPPEN AGAIN IT MAKES YOU NERVOUS 
LONG AFTER THE RAIN WATER DRAINED 
AWAY PEOPLE ARE STILL DEALING WITH 
THE MISERY IT LEFT BEHIND 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT ACCEPTS BOTH 
THE MAIN POINTS IN PARTICULAR IT 
SAYS WE NEED TO STOP CONCRETING 
OVER SO MUCH OF OUR TOWNS AND 
CITIES BECAUSE IT FORCES RAINWATER 
INTO DRAINS AND SEWERS HILARY BENN 
IS THE ENVIRONMENT SECRETARY 
IF YOU CONCRETE AND PAVE OVER ALL 
OF THE LAND IN TOWNS AND CITIES AND 
YOU GET THAT AMOUNT OF RAIN THE 
DRAINS ARE OVERWHELMED WE NEED A 
BETTER SYSTEM FOR TAKING 
RESPONSIBILITY TO CO ORDINATE THAT 
WE ARE CONSULTING AND CHANGING THE 
PLANNING PERMISSION IF YOU WANT TO 
CONCRETE OVER YOUR FRONT GARDEN AT 
THE MOMENT YOU DO NOT NEED PLANNING 
PERMISSION BUT YOU WILL NEED IT IN 
THE FUTURE 
A CONTROVERSIAL STUDY SEEN BY THE 
B. B. C. SAYS ELECTRICITY SUB STATIONS 
AND WATER TREATMENT WORKS ARE AT 
RISK OF FLOODING AND RESEARCHERS AT 
DURHAM UNIVERSITY SAY WE MAY BE IN 
FOUR YEARS OF FLOODS ON A SCALE 
BEYOND LIVING MEMORY THEY HAVE 
LOOKED AT RAINFALL PATTERNS OVER 
THE PAST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS 
THE FAMILIES OF FOURTEEN BRITISH 
SERVICEMEN WHO WERE KILLED WHEN 
THERE R. A. F. NIMROD AEROPLANE CRASHED 
IN AFGHANISTAN IN TWO THOUSAND SIX HAVE HEARD A 
RADIO RECORDING OF THEIR LAST 
MOMENTS IT WAS PLAYED AT OXFORD 
CORONER'S COURT WITH THE INQUEST 
IS BEING HELD OUR DEFENCE 
DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT IS THERE NOW 
IT IS A DIFFICULT AND EMOTIONAL DAY 
FOR THE FAMILIES THE CORONER 
ANDREW WALKER OPENED IT BY OFFERING 
HIS DEEPEST SYMPATHIES TO THE 
FAMILIES HE SAID NOTHING HE COULD 
SAY COULD COMFORT THEM BUT THE 
INQUEST COULD ESTABLISH HOW WHERE 
AND WHEN THE MEN DIED 
THE FAMILIES ARRIVING AT THE 
INQUEST AMONG THEM GRAHAM AND 
TRICIA NIGHT HE LOST THEIR SON BEN 
NIGHT THE FAMILIES HAVE WAITED 
OVER YEAR FOR THIS MOMENT TO FIND 
OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR SONS 
HUSBANDS FATHERS OR BROTHERS ON 
SEPTEMBER SECOND TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN THE FOURTEEN 
MEN WERE FLYING A RECONNAISSANCE 
MISSION OVER AFGHANISTAN THIS WAS 
NIMROD X. V. TWO THIRTY FLYING INTO ITS HOME 
BASE AT R. A. F. KINLOSS THE INQUEST 
COULD NOT START A MESS THE MOD 
FINISHED ITS INQUIRY WHEN THE THIRTY SEVEN 
YEAR OLD FLY SPAIN EXPLODED INTO 
MURDER AFTER AIR TO AIR REFUELLING 
IN THE SKIES OVER KANDAHAR KILLING 
ALL FOURTEEN ON BOARD IF YOU LEAK WAS 
RENDERED AS THE PROBABLE CAUSE THE 
FUEL TANK LEAK AND IGNITED AFTER 
COMING INTO CONTACT WITH AN UN 
INSULATED PIPE THE FIRE SPREAD 
AMONG THE AEROPLANE EXPLODED 
INQUIRIES AT SEVERAL FACTORS 
AFFECTED THE MAINTENANCE POLICY 
THE LACK OF A FIRE DETECTION AND 
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM IN THE BAY NEXT 
TO THE FUEL TANK SERIOUS FAILINGS 
THE DEFENCE SECRETARY APOLOGISE FOR 
ON BEHALF OF THE MOD AND THE ROYAL 
AIR FORCE I WOULD LIKE TO SAY 
SORRY FOR THESE FAILINGS TO THIS 
HOUSE BUT MOST OF ALL TO THE 
FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR 
LIVES 
TODAY JOURNALISTS WERE LIVES ASKED TO LEAVE THE CORONER'S COURT 
SO FAMILIES COULD HEAR A RECORDING 
OF THEIR LAST MOMENTS ON BOARD THE 
AEROPLANE THE INQUEST IS EXPECTED 
TO LAST THREE WEEKS 
THE FAMILIES WERE VERY DIGNIFIED 
VERY COMPOSED AS THEY ARRIVED THIS 
MORNING JOURNALIST WERE ASKED TO 
LEAVE SO FAMILIES COULD HEAR THE 
LAST MOMENTS OF THE MEN IT IS A 
COCKPIT RECORDING AND IT WAS PLAYED 
TO THEM AS THE CREW REALISED FIRE 
AND BROKEN OUT ON BOARD THEY SENT 
OUT A MAYDAY SIGNAL AND STARTED TO 
DO THEIR BEST TO LAND TWO MINUTES 
AFTER THAT RECORDING STOPPED THE 
AEROPLANE EXPLODED THERE WAS NO 
HOPE VERY EMOTIONAL AND 
DISTRESSING FOR THE FAMILIES TO 
HERE THEY TRIED TO COMFORT EACH 
OTHER MANY WERE CRYING AND THEN 
THEY WENT BACK INTO HEAR MORE 
EVIDENCE WITH MORE WITNESSES AND 
STILL SOME FORTY FOUR WITNESSES TO GO OVER 
THE NEXT THREE WEEKS 
LIE DETECTORS ARE TO BE OFFERED TO 
ANOTHER FIFTEEN LOCAL COUNCILS ACROSS 
BRITAIN TO TRY TO HELP CATCH 
BENEFIT CHEATS IT IS ESTIMATED 
FRAUDULENT CLAIMS COST AROUND FOUR HUNDRED 
MILLION A YEAR QUESTIONS ARE BEING 
ASKED ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THE 
TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY HE IS FIT ENOUGH TO TEACH MARTIAL 
ARTS BUT THIS MONTH LIKE 
THOUSANDS OF OTHERS THOUGHT HE 
COULD GET AWAY WITH CLAIMING 
DISABILITY BENEFIT WHILE WORKING 
HE WAS CAUGHT ON CAMERA FINDING 
FRAUDSTERS ISN'T EASY THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS DETERMINED TO 
CATCH THOSE WHO ARE CHEATING THE 
SYSTEM OUT OF FOUR HUNDRED MILLION EVERY 
YEAR AND THINKS IT HAS FOUND A NEW 
AND BETTER WAY TO GET AT THEM 
ENTER LIE DETECTORS A YEAR AGO 
THEY WERE INTRODUCED IN SEVEN AREAS 
AND HAVE PROVED SO SUCCESSFUL FIFTEEN 
MORE COUNCILS WILL BE GIVEN THE 
CASH TO INSTALL THE EQUIPMENT THIS 
IS HOW IT WORKS IT RECORDS A 
CONVERSATION AND FLASHES A WARNING 
ON THE SCREEN IF THERE IS A 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE SOUND OF 
THE BOYS AT THE SAME TIME 
OPERATORS ARE MAKING NOTES ON 
WHETHER THAT PERSON IS HESITATING 
IN COMING UP WITH ANSWERS OR 
WHETHER THEY SOUND TONGUE TIED OR 
NERVOUS CRITICS ARE CONCERNED THE 
LIE DETECTOR SYSTEM MIGHT BE 
FRIGHTENED SOME PEOPLE FROM 
APPLYING FOR MONEY THEY COULD 
LEGITIMATELY CLAIM 
SOMEONE WHO IS 
A PRACTISED LIAR WHO IS 
DELIBERATELY DEFRAUDING THE SYSTEM 
MAY BE ABLE TO BEAT EQUIPMENT LIKE 
THIS WERE AS SOMEONE WHO IS HONEST 
MAY BE SCARED OF CLAIMING THE 
BENEFIT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE SYSTEM IS 
EFFECTIVE 
THE IMPORTANT THING TO EFFECTIVE UNDERSTAND IS IT FLAGS UP A RISK 
IN THE CORE IT DOES NOT PROVE 
FRAUD IN ITSELF BUT IT IS AN 
IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL BIT OF TOOLING 
IT IS EXPECTED THE LIE DETECTORS 
WILL BE ROLLED OUT NATIONALLY AND 
THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS IT WILL SAVE 
TAXPAYERS MILLIONS OF POUNDS A YEAR 
RUSSIA HAS NEW PRESIDENT DMITRY 
MEDVEDEV HAS BEEN SWORN IN IN A 
CEREMONY IN WHICH HE NOMINATED HIS 
PREDECESSOR VLADIMIR PUTIN AS 
PRIME MINISTER IT MEANS MR. PUTIN 
WILL REMAIN A POWERFUL FIGURE IN 
RUSSIAN POLITICS 
INSIDE THE KREMLIN'S MAIN PALACE 
VLADIMIR PUTIN THE MAN WHO HAS 
RULED RUSSIA FOR THE PAST EIGHT 
YEARS TAKES HIS LAST STEPS AS 
PRESIDENT FORCED TO STAND DOWN BY 
LAW EVEN THOUGH HE REMAINS AT THE 
PEAK OF HIS POPULARITY 
BUT HIS CHOSEN SUCCESSOR DMITRY 
MEDVEDEV IS A YOUNG AND LOYAL ALLY 
HE OWES EVERYTHING TO MR. PUTIN AS 
HE WAS SWORN IN HE PROMISED 
CONTINUITY ALTHOUGH THERE ARE 
HINTS OF A NEW EMPHASIS 
MY MOST IMPORTANT TASK 
IS DEVELOP CIVIL AND ECONOMIC 
FREEDOMS AND WE MUST GUESS PEAT 
GET PEOPLE TO RESPECT THE LAW 
THERE IS LOT 
TO BE DONE IF WE ARE TO BUILD FIRST DATE 
AFFAIR STAYED 
AFTER THE HANDOVER OF POWER THE 
NEW AND FORMER LEADER STOOD 
TOGETHER TO INSPECT THE 
PRESIDENTIAL GUARD THEY SIGNED MR. 
PUTIN HAS NO INTENTION OF NOW 
DISAPPEARING FROM POLITICS IN FACT 
HE IS GOING TO REMAIN AT THE HEART 
OF POWER ON THURSDAY HE IS 
BECOMING PRIME MINISTER RUSSIA IS 
ABOUT TO HAVE TWO LEADERS NOT ONE 
AND NOBODY KNOWS HE WILL BE IN 
CHARGE CHARGE IMAGINE THIS YOU ARE VIOLIN 
VIRTUOSO AND YOU HAVE A STAB OF 
VARIOUS WHICH IS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS 
OLD AND WORTH TWO MILLION AND YOU 
LEAVE IT IN THE BACK OF TAXI 
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO PHILIPPE 
QUINT IN NEW YORK LUCKY FOR HIM 
THE TAXI DRIVER RETURNED IT AND HE 
HAS BEEN REPAID WITH FREE CONCERT 
PHILIPPE QUINT A GRAMMY NOMINATED 
VIOLINIST HUGELY TALENTED AND VERY 
LUCKY ACCUSTOMED TO PUSHED 
AUDIENCES IN THE WORLD'S FINEST 
CONCERT HALLS HE BROUGHT HIS 
ACCLAIMED BREADTH OF TONE AND 
PASSION TO NEWARK LIBERTY 
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT HIS THANK 
YOU TO THE DRIVER WHO RETURNS THE 
IRREPLACEABLE VIOLIN HE LEFT IN THE 
BACK OF A TAXI 
I CERTAINLY WASN'T PLANNING ON 
LEAVING IT IN THE CAB WHAT 
HAPPENED WAS I WAS RETRIEVING MY 
BIKES FROM THE TRUNK AND I PUT THEM 
OVER THE ROAD AND WHEN I TURN BACK 
EYESORE THE TAXI IN THE DISTANCE 
THE VIOLIN INSIDE WAS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE YEAR 
OLD STADE ARE VARIOUS WORTH TWO 
MILLION AND WAS ONLY ON LOAN TO HIM 
TRAVEL VARIOUS 
FRANTIC WITH WORRY HE CALLED THE 
POLICE AND THEN TAXI COMMISSION 
HE COULD ONLY SUGGEST PLOWING 
THROUGH THOUSANDS OF PHOTOS TO SEE 
IF HE RECOGNISED HIS DRIVER THE THE MOST FAMOUS DRIVER IN THE WORLD 
MOHAMED KHALIL FOUNDED THE VIOLIN 
AND HANDED IT IN THE MUSICIAN GAVE 
HIM THE ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS HE HAD IN HIS WALLET 
AND TICKETS TO SEE HIS NEXT 
PERFORMANCE IN CONNIE HALT IN NEW 
YORK YORK WHAT A LUCKY MAN 
NOW THE WEATHER 
IT IS WARM SUNSHINE LOTS OF THAT 
HAVE COME AS WE HEAD THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON SUNNY AND WARM YOU 
CANNOT BEAT IT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR 
THE REASON IS WE ARE DRAGGING OUR 
AIR IN OFF THE NEAR BY CONSONANTS 
ON A SOUTH EASTERLY BREEZE YOU CAN 
SEE THE WARMER COLOURS APPEARING ON 
THE CHART AND NOT BEING THE BEST 
QUALITY OF AIR ESPECIALLY IN THE 
SOUTH EAST TEMPERATURES ALREADY 
AROUND THE TWENTY FOUR DEGREE MARK IN LONDON 
WE MAY HIT TWENTY FIVE COOLER 
ALONG THE NORTH SEA FACING COAST 
BECAUSE OF THE ONSHORE BREEZE 
ACROSS WESTERN SCOTLAND THERE IS A 
POTENTIAL FOR SHOWER THIS 
AFTERNOON AND WE COULD SEE THE ODD 
SHOWER ESPECIALLY TOWARDS COUNTY 
FERMANAGH BUT NOT BAD ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND WALES HAS THE 
POTENTIAL FOR SHOWERS BUT THEY ARE 
FEW AND FAR BETWEEN YOU WILL BE 
UNLUCKY IF YOU DO SEE ONE IT IS 
DRY WARM AND SUNNY FOR MOST 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE INTO THE LOW 
TWENTIES BUT LITTLE BIT COOLER WITH 
THE SOUTH EASTERLY BREEZE 
OVERNIGHT ANY SHOWERS DIE AWAY AND 
IT IS DRY NIGHT CLEAR SKIES AND 
STAYING MILD IN THE SOUTH 
TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN INTO 
DOUBLE DIGITS FURTHER NORTH 
LITTLE BIT COOLER SIXES AND SEVENS 
TOWARDS SCOTLAND MIST THAT IS 
FORMING OVERNIGHT AND THEY WILL
