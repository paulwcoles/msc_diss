IS THAT THE 
ONLY REASON THAT'S REASON ENOUGH 
YOU ARE VOTING FOR A MAYOR WE NEED 
SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO BE 
ACCOUNTABLE 
YOU HEARD WHAT THE ACCOUNTABLE LADY SAID SHE'S WRONG TIME FOR A FINAL DIG FROM HIM AT 
HIS JOCULAR OPPONENT KEN IT WAS 
WHO USED TO HAVE THE GAGS ALL TO 
HIMSELF IN FACT NOT QUITE THE 
FINAL DIG 
WHAT COMES OVER IS THIS 
KID WHO LEARNED VERY EARLY ON IF

SAY SORRY YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH 
EVERYTHING STKPWHRFLT OVER A CUPPA 
IN KEN'S CAFE WARMING AGAIN TO HIS 
THEME THEME HE'S DOING HIS BEST HE IS DOING 
WHAT HE THINKS IS RIGHT THAT'S ALL 
WE CAN ASK OF ANYBODY

VOTE FOR HIM 
NOT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT ABOUT NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT 
CAN I GET BACON SARNIE SORRY SORRY ABOUT THAT I'VE GOT CUSTOMERS THE THE MAYOR CAN PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF 
THE OTHER IT'S THE KEY 
DETERMINENANT FOR THE JOB 
IN THE 
KEN HEARTLAND OF NEWHAM THERE IS 
STILL THE PASSION 
WE LOVE HIM 
HE'S DOWN TO US CAN YOU SEE HIM 
NOTHING KEN IS WITHIN US HE 
HUGGED US WE LOVE HIM 
YOU DON'T 
THINK HE HAS HAD TOO LONG AFTER 
EIGHT YEARS NO 
OTHERS THOUGH NO NO LONGER SO SURE 
I STILL HAVE KEN AT THE BACK OF MY 
MIND BUT I'M STILL UNSURE BECAUSE 
I STILL FEEL SERIOUS ISSUES 
CONCERNING PEOPLE LIVING IN LONDON 
HAVE NOT BEEN TACKLED 
TOO MANY GUNS AND KNIVES ON THE 
STREETS I WANT TO GET THE GUNS AND 
KNIVES OFF THE STREET 
HE MAY BE 
THE OUTSIDER BUT KIDS IN A 
CLASSROOM ARE THE MOST CAPTIVE OF 
AUDIENCES AUDIENCES HE WAS REALLY GOOD HE SEEMED TO 
TREAT US LIKE WE WERE HUMAN BEINGS 
I LIKE HIS PLAN FOR LONDON LIKE 
GETTING THE CRIME OFF THE STREET 
AND THE ENVIRONMENT 
BUT WOULD THEY 
TELL THEIR PARENTS YES YES YES YES TONIGHT THE CAMPAIGN REALLY IS ALL 
OVER BAR THE SHOUTING 
HE'S DOWN TO US 
THE RESULT FOR MAYOR IS LIKELY TO 
BE A CLOSE CONTEST BUT A REMINDER 
THIS IS NOT FIRST PAST THE POST 
SYSTEM LIKE A GENERAL ELECTION HE 
GET TWO CHOICES FOR MAYOR THE 
OUTCOME IS LIKELY TO HANG ON THE 
SECOND PREFERENCE VOTE KATHARINE 
CARPENTER REPORTS 
YOU WILL GET THREE FORMS IN THE 
POLLING BOOTH THE PINK ONE IS FOR 
YOUR MAYORAL VOTE YOU WILL NEED TO 
SELECTION FIRST AND SECOND CHOICE 
CANDIDATES BUT IT'S THAT SECOND 
VOTE THAT IS STILL CAUSING 
CONFUSION CONFUSION HERE'S THE TECHNICAL BIT SAY THESE 
ARE OUR CANDIDATES IF ONE OF THEM 
GETS MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT OF THE FIRST 
CHOICE VOTES IT'S GAME OVER AND 
THEY'RE THE NEW MAYOR 
BUT IF THERE IS NOT A CLEAR WINNER 
THE TWO CANDIDATES WITH THE MOST 
VOTES WILL GO THROUGH TO A SECOND 
ROUND ROUND IF YOU DIDN'T GIVE YOUR FIRST VOTE 
TO EITHER OF THE TOP TWO THIS IS 
WHERE YOUR SECOND PREFERENCE KICKS 
IN ALL SECOND VOTES FOR THEM WILL 
BE ADDED TO THEIR TOTAL 
THE CANDIDATE WITH THE MOST VOTES 
WILL BE THE NEW MAYOR 
STILL WITH ME BASICALLY GIVING 
YOUR SECOND VOTE TO A SMALLER PARTY 
COULD BE COMPLETE WASTE THE 
POLLSTERS YOU GOV CAN EXPLAIN MORE 
IF YOUR FIRST VOTE IS FOR ONE OF 
THE ELIMINATED CANDIDATES YOUR 
SECOND VOTE WILL COUNT ONLY IF IT'S 
FOR ONE OF THE TWO CANDIDATES THAT 
ARE STILL IN THE RACE ONE OF THE 
TOP TWO IF YOUR SECOND PREFERENCE 
VOTE IS CAST FOR ANYBODY ELSE IT 
SIMPLY WON'T BE COUNTING BECAUSE 
YOU WILL CAST YOUR VOTE FOR A 
CANDIDATE WHO HAS BEEN KNOCKED OUT 
OF THE RACE 
A WORD OF WARNING IF 
YOU VOTE TWICE FOR THE SAME 
CANDIDATE IT WON'T INCREASE HIS OR 
HER CHANCES OF WINNING IF YOU ONLY 
MARK A SECOND CHOICE YOUR BALLOT 
PAPER WON'T BE COUNTED THIS 
ELECTION COULD BE DECIDED BY YOUR 
SECOND VOTE YOU MIGHT WANT TO 
THINK TWICE BEFORE THROWING IT AWAY 
WELL HERE THEY ARE ACROSS LONDON 
BRAVING THE RAIN THE THREE MAIN 
CANDIDATES ONE OF WHOM COULD BE 
THE ONER BY THIS TIME FRIDAY THANK

BUSES

DELIGHTED THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
UNDERSTOOD WHAT WE ARE OFFERING 
AND THAT THEY WANT A NEW PROGRAMME 
FOR TRANSPORT OF COURSE THE 
MAJORITY OF LONDONERS I HAVE TALKED 
TO TODAY SEEM VERY CONFIDENT THAT 
WE WILL GO FOR CHANGE TOMORROW L. 
DO HOPE THAT LONDON WILL OPT FOR 
SOMEONE WHO IS OFFERING FRESH 
THINKING AND NEW IDEAS NOT JUST ON 
TRANSPORT AND BUSES BUT ABOVE ALL 
ON THE THING THAT REALLY MATTERS TO 
THEM AND THAT IS CRIME AND THE FEAR 
OF CRIME 
YOU DO FEEL 
CAN I MAKE ONE 
POINT GO ON

ONE FINAL POINT ABOUT BUSES WHICH 
IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD THIS THE

USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT

IS TIRED AND STEAL AND RUNNING OUT 
OF NEW THINKING THAT IS WHAT WE 
ARE OFFERING TOMORROW BORIS BORIS JOHNSON THANK YOU DO STAY WITH US

POLLS SHOWS ME GAINING RAPIDLY ON 
THE OTHERS L. THINK I HAVE MORE

BRIAN PADDICK MANY 
THANKS THANKS KEN LIVINGSTONE IF WE CAN TURN TO 
YOU NOW AS YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE 
CAMPAIGN YOU MUST HAVE FOUND IT A 
TERRIBLE INDICTMENT OF YOUR EIGHT 
YEARS IN OFFERS YOU SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN ASKED SO OFTEN ABOUT TRUTH AND 
HOPPESTY 
NOT REALLY WE'VE HAD TWENTY HOPPESTY WEEKS OF A SMEAR CAMPAIGN BY THE 
EVENING STANDARD WHAT HAS BEEN 
QUITE ENCOURAGING ONCE WE WERE 
ABLE TO GET INTO THE DEBATES WHERE 
PEOPLE COULD SEE REPORTERS LIKE 
YOURSELF OR JEREMY PAXMAN PINNING 
US DOWN AND QUESTIONING US THE 
BIDING MEMORY IS YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE 
WHAT I SAY BUT AT LEAST YOU GET AN 
ANSWER BORIS WAS NOT CLEAR ABOUT 
WHAT HE WAS SAYING L. KNOW BORIS IS 
SAYING THE FREEDOM PASS IS SAFE 
WITH HIM BUT THE KEY PLAYER HE 
BROUGHT IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AGO THE HEAD 
OF THE TRANSPORT BODY THAT'S 
OVERSEES WHAT WE ARE DOING CAME 
OUT AND SPECIFICALLY SAID IT WAS A 
MISTAKE TO EXTEND THE FREEDOM PASS 
SO THAT PENSIONERS COULD USE IT 
BEFORE NINE HUNDRED A M. THAT IS SOMEONE 
BORIS HAD COURTED BORIS PUT THEM 
ON HIS OWN WEBSITE ALL MY LIFE 
I'VE HAD TORIES VOTING AGAINST THE 
FREEDOM PASS LAST YEAR THE TORY 
COUNCIL SAID IT WAS A STEALTH TAX 
BORIS DOES PROTEST TOO MUCH 
COMMENTATORS ARE SAYING THE SPARK 
IS GONE DO YOU THINK LONDONERS 
DESERVE A MAYOR WHO HAS A HUNGER 
FOR IT 
I FEEL I'M JUST STARTING 
OUT I PERSUADED THE GOVERNMENT TO 
GIVE THE MAYOR WHO IS ELECTED 
TOMORROW FOUR BILLION TO BUILD FIFTY THOUSAND 
AFFORDABLE HOMES HOMES FOR 
LONDONERS TO RENT A HOUSING 
PROGRAMME THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE 
SIZE OF SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES L. 
PERSUADED THE GOVERNMENT TO GIVE 
THE MAYOR TO GIVE SKILLS AND 
TRAINING TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
BEEN FAILED BY OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM 
THE MAYORALTY IS ON THE VERGE OF 
BECOMING A BIGGER BODY THAT CAN 
REACH OUT AND TACKLE POVERTY AND 
PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND L. FOUGHT TO GET 
THOSE POWERS I'M REALLY KEEN L. 
WILL APPOINT MYSELF TO CHAIR THE 
HOUSING BOARD THAT WILL IDENTIFY

SO THAT THE PUBLIC AND THE POLICE 
ARE STANDING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER 
AGAINST THE CRIMINAL THE 
EXTREMISTS AND THE RACISTS IT'S 
THEM THAT WILL FEEL ISOLATED AND 
THREATENED NOT LAW ABIDING PEOPLE 
I WILL GET LOCAL POLICE CHIEFS TO 
CONCENTRATE ON THOSE THINGS THAT 
ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO LOCAL PEOPLE 
I'M GOING MAKE STOP AND SEARCH FAIR 
FOR EVERYBODY 
KEN LIVINGSTONE THE SAME QUESTION 
TO YOU YOUR THIRTY SECONDS STARTS NOW 
LIKE THE OTHERS I WILL CARRY ON 
EXPANDING THE POLICE FORCE WE HAVE 
GOT TO GET SOMETHING FOR OUR KIDS 
TO DO ALL OVER LONDON KIDS HAVE 
SAID TO ME THERE'S NOTHING DO 
AROUND HERE THE GOVERNMENT WILL 
GIVE ME SEVEN NINE MILLION TO DOUBLE 
WEEKEND ACTIVITIES AND EVENING 
ACTIVITIES TAKING KIDS OFF THE 
STREETS AWAY FROM GANGS AND GIVING 
THEM ROLE MODELS AND MENTORS AND 
GETTING THEM INTO SECOND CHANCE 
COURSES MOST OF THE KIDS WHO GET 
INTO TROUBLE HAVE BEEN FAILED BY 
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM 
THE TIME IS UP 
GENTLEMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE DO APPRECIATE IT 
YOU HAVE HEARD FROM THEM THERE 
THAT'S IT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO NOW 
IS TO VOTE 
THE BEST PLACE FOR RESULTS AND 
ANALYSIS ON FRIDAY IS B. B. C. LONDON 
NEWS NEWS FOR NOW DO STAY WITH US THERE'S 
PLENTY MORE AHEAD BEFORE SEVEN HUNDRED P. M. 
INCLUDING INCLUDING FANCY THIS FOR YOUR COMMUTE THE 
CAMPAIGN TO MAKE THEM LEGAL HERE 
OUCH OUCH PLUS ALIENS UNDERGROUND FIND OUT 
WHY THE CAPITAL'S BEING INVADED 
THIS WEEKEND 
C. C. T. V. CAMERAS ARE BEING USED TO 
CATCH PARENTS WHO PARK ILLEGALLY 
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL GATES 
HARROW COUNCIL SAYS IT'S ALL ABOUT 
MAKING IT SAFER FOR THE KIDS AND 
NOT ABOUT REVENUE RAISING 
IT COMES AFTER ANOTHER LONDON 
COUNCIL STARTED EXPERIMENTING WITH 
CHARGING PARENTS TO PARK OUTSIDE 
SCHOOLS 
THIS CAR IS ON A SPECIAL SORT OF 
SCHOOL RUN NO CHILDREN TO DROP OFF 
INSTEAD IT'S SPYING ON THE CARS 
THAT ARE PARENTS ARE FILMED AND 
CAN BE FINED FOR STOPPING IN THE 
WRONG PLACE HARROW COUNCIL'S 
RESPONDING TO CONCERNS OF LOCAL 
SCHOOLS SCHOOLS WE HAVE SLOT OF TEN MINUTES WHERE 
THERE ARE MANY MANY PARENTS 
DROPPING OFF THEIR KIDS HURRYING TO 
WHEREVER THEY ARE GOING ON TO NEXT 
DROPPING CHILDREN ON THE YELLOW 
LINES AND NOT TURNING ENGINES OFF 
NOT PARKING PROPERLY CHILDREN 
LITERALLY OPENING DOORS AND JUMPING 
OUT OF CARS 
THIS IS THE SORT OF 
BEHAVIOUR THEY'RE TRYING TO STOP 
NO TIENS FOOD FOR NOW JUST A 
DETERRENT TO TRY AND PREVENT THE 
DAILY CHAOS 
WE HAVE THE CAMERA 
WHICH EXTENDS UP IN THE AIR WE CAN 
PAN AROUND WITH IT 
THE PROCESS IS 
SIMPLE ONCE C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE IS CALM 
TURED A PHOTO AND FINE ARE SENT TO 
TROUBLEMAKERS HARROW COUNCIL 
DENIES MOTORISTS ARE BEING UNFAIRLY 
TARGETED 
THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL TARGETED HAS SENT OUT LEAFLETS THEY'VE SENT 
PARENTS AND TEACHERS OUT TO TRY AND 
PERSUADE PARENTS NOT TO BEHAVE IN 
THIS WAY THEY'VE CONTINUED TO DO 
SO IT'S NOT BIG BROTHER WE ARE 
LOOKING AFTER THE MAJORITY 
THIS IS 
JUST A TRIAL AT THE MOMENT IF 
PARENTS KEEP BREAKING THE LAW THEY 
COULD FACE FINES OF UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
IF THEY PAY IN TIME IN THE 
MEANTIME THIS CAR CAN ONEL ALSO BE 
USED TO PATROL YELLOW BOX 
JUNCTIONSS FOR EXAMPLE THE SCHOOL 
RUN'S FAST BECOMING A BATTLEGROUND 
SOME COUNCILS ARE CONSIDERING 
SCHOOL RUN PERMITS 
I'VE TRIED TELLING PARENTS HERE TO 
STOP BUT THEY BECOME ABUSIVE IT'S 
A REALLY GOOD IDEA 
IF PEOPLE DON'T 
PARK SAFELY SOMETHING HAS TO BE 
DONE ABOUT IT 
THIS CAR COULD 
BECOME A REGULAR FEATURE IN HARROW 
AND BEYOND 
THERE WILL BE NO CHARGES INVOLVED 
IN THE CASE OF A NIGERIAN 
BUSINESSMAN WHO DIED WHILE BEING 
RESTRAINED BY POLICE FORTY THREE YEAR OLD 
FRANK OGBORU HAD BEEN HAVING AN 
ARGUMENT WHEN POLICE WERE CALLED TO 
THE SEEN WITNESSES CLAIMED 
OFFICERSS WERE OFFICERS WERE 
HEAVY HANDED THE CROWN PROSECUTION 
SERVICE SAID THE PERIOD WAS BRIEF 
AND NOT UNLAWFUL MOTORISTS FACED A 
SECOND DAY OF DISRUPTION AS A 
BUILDING COLLAPSED ON THE TRINITY 
ROAD IN TOOTING BEC THE ROAD 
REMAINS CLOSED WHILE A CLEANUP 
OPERATION TO REMOVE THE RUBBLE 
CONTINUES A MAN'S BEEN ARRESTED 
AFTER A THREE HOUR ARMED SIEGE 
FOUR PEOPLE WERE KEPT HOSTAGE AT A 
BUSINESS IN STANSTEAD ABBOTS THIS 
MORNING THE MAN WHO HELD THEM 
THERE IS THOUGHT TO BE A DELIVERY 
DRIVER IN HIS THIRTIES OFFICERS ARE NOW 
SEARCHING THE AREA FOR WEAPONS 
THEY ARE SPENDING MONEY LIKE WATER 
THAT WAS THE CRITICISM OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
ORGANISERS TODAY FROM AN 
INFLUENTIAL GROUP OF M. P.'S IT IS 
SOME OF THE TOUGHEST WORDS WE HAVE 
HEARD SINCE LONDON GOT THE GAMES 
THREE YEARS AGO THE REPORT SAYS 
THE TREBLING OF THE ORIGINAL BUDGET 
IS UNDERMINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN 
THE EVENT WE CAN TALK TO OUR 
REPORTER ADRIAN HARSH WORDS THERE 
BUT ARE THEY FAIR WORDS 
I THINK 
NOW AND AGAIN IT IS IMPORTANT TO 
GET WAY FROM ALL THAT WESTMINSTER 
BUBBLE AND TAKE SOME PERSPECTIVE ON 
IT WHEN ATHENS WERE PREPARING FOR 
THE TWO ZERO ZERO ZERO FOUR GAMES THEY WERE TAKEN 
ASIDE AND GIVEN A VERY VERY PUBLIC 
WARNING TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE I. O. C. SAID IF YOU 
DON'T GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER THE 
GAMES ARE NOT COMING NOW THEY DID 
AND IT TOOK THEM A WHILE BUT IF 
YOU LOOK AROUND HERE YOU CAN SEE 
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DANGER OF 
THAT HAPPENING HERE THERE HAS BEEN 
MASSIVE I KNOW IT'S A BIT OF A 
ROUGH NIGHT BUT YOU CAN SEE 
MASSIVE CHANGES THAT HAVE GONE ON 
HERE AND I TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE 
MOVEMENT NOBODY IS SAYING TO ME 
THERE ARE GOING TO BE THERE 
AREN'T GOING FOB ANY GAMES THERE 
IS CONFIDENCE THAT LONDON WILL 
DELIVER A SPECTACULAR GAMES IT IS 
IMPORTANT WITH THE DOOM AND GLOOM 
TO LOOK AT THAT NEVERTHELESS NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS BEING 
ASKED ABOUT THE BUDGET 
OF COURSE 
THE AQUAT QUICK CENTRE ORIGINALLY 
GOING TO COST SEVENTY FIVE MILLION NOW IT 
IS COSTING THREE HUNDRED MILLION WHEN YOU 
HAVE GOT A SITUATION LIKE THAT 
PEOPLE GOING WHAT IS GOING ON HOW 
MUCH ARE THESE GAMES GOING TO COST 
I THINK EREALITY IS THAT THE COST 
OF THE OLYMPICS IS GOING TO BE A 
BIG QUESTION RIGHT THROUGH THE 
GAMES AND BEYOND UNTIL THE FINAL 
BOOK WORK IS DONE BUT THERE IS A 
BIGGER ISSUE HERE WHEN SYDNEY WERE 
HAVING THE GAMES THEY HAD A SITCOM 
ABOUT THE GAMES L. THINK WHAT WE 
HAVE GOT IS A BIT OF A PANT OWE 
THE MINISTER IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE 
A VILLAIN PEOPLE WILL BE READY TO 
BOO AND TESSA JOWELL WILL HAVE TO 
LIVE WITH THAT FOR THE NEXT FEW 
YEARS 
I BET IT WILL LOOK BETTER IN YEARS THE SUNSHINE AND DRY WEATHER THANK 
YOU THERE ARE THEY ARE A NOVEL 
AND PECULIAR LOOKING FORM OF 
TRANSPORT BUT WOULD LEGALISING THE 
USE HELP CUT CONGESTION IN THE 
CAPITAL A CAMPAIGN HAS BECOME BY A 
GROUP OF M. P.'S WHO WANT THESE TO BE 
ALLOWED TO BE USES ON ROADS AND 
CYCLE LANES WE SENT TOM EDWARDS 
OUT IN THE RAIN TO HAVE A GO NO 
IT'S NOT TAR TREK BUT COULD IT BE 
THE FUTURE THIS MAN IS A MARINE 
ENGINEER AND USING HIS PERSONAL 
TRANSPORTER FOR HIS DAILY COMMUTE 
EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE BANNED ON 
ROADS AND PAVEMENTS IN THE U. K. HE 
HAS BECOME SOMETHING OF AN 
EVANGELIST FOR SEGWAYS 
IT IS 
PROBABLY MY QUICKER WAY DOOR TO 
DOOR FROM GETTING FROM HOME TO WORK 
I USED TO MOTORCYCLE BUT THIS IS 
QUICKER BECAUSE BY THE TIME YOU 
HAVE FOUND SOMEWHERE TO PARK YOU 
HAVE ARRIVED WITH THE SEGWAY THE THE MANUFACTURERS SAY THEY ARE EMISSION 
FREE AND ACROSS THE WORLD FOUR HUNDRED 
POLICE FORCES USE THEM ALTHOUGH IN 
SUTTON POLICE HAD TO ABORT THEIR 
TRIAL AS THEY ARE NOT LEGAL ON THE 
ROADS CRITICS SAY IT IS BETTER TO 
CYCLE OR WALK THEY DO TURN HEADS 
I DON'T THINK IT WILL OVERTAKE CABS 
FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN ONE 
WHAT DO 
YOU THINK 
WHAT IS IT 
WE GAVE IT 
SPIN ON A PRIVATE ROAD THE 
QUESTION IS HOW EASY IT APART FROM 
THAT LITTLE WOBBLE IT'S NOT TOO 
BAD I'VE BEEN DRIVING ABOUT FIVE 
MINUTES AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE A 
FEW THOUSAND OF THESE IN THE 
COUNTRY THEY COST AROUND FOUR THOUSAND 
EACH ALTHOUGH NOT SO EASY FOR 
GEORGE W. BUSH WHO FELL OFF HIS 
TODAY MORE POLITICIANS WERE BEING 
GIVEN GO THIS GROUP OF M. P.'S 
BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD 
CHANGE LEGISLATION TO ALLOW THEM 
AREN'T THEY DANGEROUS ISN'T THE 
WORRY IF YOU GET HIT YOU WILL HAVE 
SERIOUS INJURIES 
I DON'T THINK SO 
EVEN AT MAXIMUM SPEED OF TEN M. P. H. IF 
YOU DID HIT SOMEBODY IT IS GOING TO 
BE A LOT LESS HARM DONE THAN IF YOU 
WERE HIT BY SOMEONE IN A CAR AT 
THIRTY M. P. H. 
THEY ARE NOT FOR THE SELF THIRTY M. P. H. CONSCIOUS AND THEY ARE NOT CHEAP 
BUT SOME M. P.'S NOW BELIEVE THE 
BENEFITS OF PERSONAL TRANSPORTERS 
SHOULD BE SERIOUSLY EXAMINED WITH A 
U. K. TRIAL AN INQUIRY IS UNDER WAY 
AT A CARE HOME WHERE A DEMENTIA 
PATIENT ACCIDENTLY STRANGLED 
HIMSELF AFTER BEING LEFT 
UNSUPERVISED HERTFORDSHIRE SOCIAL 
SERVICES WON'T SAY WHAT THE 
INVESTIGATION IS ABOUT OR WHY IT 
HAS STOPPED TAKING NEW PATIENTS AN 
INSPECTION LAST YEAR SAID SEVEN 
AREAS NEEDED IMPROVEMENT OFFICERS 
FROM THE THE METROPOLITAN POLICE 
TODAY RECEIVED AWARDS FROM 
COMMISSIONER SIR IAN BLAIR FOR 
COWER RAGEOUS ACTS IN THE LINE OF 
DUTY POLICE SERGEANT KRISTIAN 
WRIGHT RECEIVED A COMMENDATION 
AFTER PURSUING A ROBBER DESPITE 
BEING THREATENED WITH A FIREARM 
THE ASSISTANCE OF SOME OF MY 
COLLEAGUES WE RECOVERED THE GUN AND 
CASH AND YES THERE ARE RISKS 
INVOLVED IN THE JOB BUT ABSOLUTELY 
I WOULD DO IT AGAIN AND I NEED TO 
DO IT AGAIN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF 
MY COLLEAGUES 
THIS SOUNDS BIZARRE 
BUT IF YOU HAPPEN TO SPOT ANY 
ALIENS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS FEAR 
NOT IT'S BECAUSE THE LONDON SCI FI 
FESTIVAL IS ON BUT WHO ARE THE 
PEOPLE WHO WILL BE QUEUING TO SEE 
THE LATEST THAT THE FUTURE HAS TO 
TO MEET ONE OF 
OFFER WE HAVE BEEN TO MEET ONE OF THEM I'VE GOT A VERY BIG LOVE FOR 
THE ALIEN FILMS AND I HAVE TO SAY I 
DO QUITE ENJOY SCI FI GENERALLY 
COSTUMES IS MADE OF CAST LATEX 
RUBBER AND FOAM FILLED IT IS 
ASSEMBLED OVER A LIKE RA BODY SUIT 
MY NAME IS GARETH AND I'M DRESSED 
AS AN ALIEN FROM THE SERIES OF 
FILMS I'M ALSO KNOWN AS ABE THE 
ALIEN HE IS A LOT MORE ATTRACTIVE 
THAN ME I'M SYSTEMS 
ADMINISTRATOR FOR A COMPUTER 
COMPANY I'M NORMALLY QUITE SHY 
BUT AS YOU SEE ABE ISN'T 
DO YOU HAVE AN OYSTER CARD I WORD 
FOR THE U. K. COLONIAL MARINES AND WE 
ARE A CHARITY COSTUMING GROUP THAT 
GOES TO EVENTS U. K. AND ABOARD TO 
RAISE MONEY AND TO HAVE MONEY THIS THIS IS A PICCADILLY LINE SERVICE TO 
COCK FOSERS 
NORMALLY WE GO TO 
SHOWS AND WE ENTERTAIN THE PUBLIC 
AND WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS TODAY I'M 
GOING TO THE SCI FI LONDON FILM 
FESTIVAL PROMOTING THE D. V. D. RELEASE 
OF ALIEN AND PREDATOR THE SECOND IT'S VERY 
HOT BUT IF YOU DRINK A LOT OF 
WATER IT IS NORMALLY TOLERABLE 
SOMETIMES I CAN DRINK TWO LITRES AN 
HOUR AND ALSO NOT GO TO THE TOILET 
IN THAT TIME 
HE IS PRETTY NORMAL 
FOR THE UNDERGROUND AT THIS TIME OF 
TIME 
I HAVE SO MUCH FUN I'M JUST TIME IN THE BEGINNINGS OF MAKING ANOTHER 
COSTUME HOPEFULLY IT SHOULD BE A 
BILL MORE REALISTIC IT IS MAKING 
PEOPLE HAPPY WHETHER YOU ARE 
SCARING THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN SCARE 
PEOPLE AND MAKE THEM HAPPY AT THE 
SAME TAME TIME THAT WAS GARETH 
ONE WAY OF KEEPING DRY ON THAT 
NOTE LET'S GET A CHECK ON THE 
WEATHER WITH PETER 
MORE RAIN IT IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO 
A SLIPPERY PITCH AT STAMFORD BRIDGE 
EVENTUALLY THE SHOWERY RAIN SHOULD 
PETER OUT OVERNIGHT BUT IT WILL 
TAKE MUCH OF THE NIGHT FOR IT TO 
DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY AS IT DOES SO 
TEMPERATURES WILL SLIP TO AROUND SIX 
OAR SEVEN BRIGHT START TOMORROW BUT 
IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE THE SHOWERS 
GET GOING BY THE AFTERNOON SOME 
WILL BE HEAVY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO 
GET WET POP DOWN THE POLLING 
STATION IN THE WARM SUNSHINE 
BETWEEN THE SHOWERS THE POLLING 
STATIONS OPEN AT SEVEN A M. AND CLOSE AT 
TEN P. M. IT'S NOT JUST LONDON VOTING 
TOMORROW OF COURSE THERE ARE LOCAL 
COUNCIL ELECTIONS OUTSIDE LONDON 
BUT THE SAME WEATHER FOR ALL OF US 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS SHOWERS AGAIN 
ON FRIDAY IT SEEMS LIKELY THEY 
WILL MERGE INTO LONGER SPELLS OF 
RAIN AT THE MOMENT THE BANK 
HOLIDAY WEEKEND WEATHER IS AS 
FINELY BALANCED AS THE ELECTION IN 
LONDON THE MOST LIKELY IS THAT 
WE'LL START OFF WITH DRY AND SUNNY 
WEATHER AND AS THE WEEKEND GOES ON 
THE RISK OF RAIN WILL INCREASE 
CERTAINLY WE'LL GET SOME MORE RAIN 
TOMORROW MORE WET WEATHER ON 
FRIDAY BUT THE MOST PROBABLE THING 
AS FAR AS THE BANK HOLIDAY IS 
CONCERNED AT THE MOMENT IT SHOULD 
DRY UP BRIGHTEN UP AND WARM UP 
BUT IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO DO 
ANYTHING MAJOR OUTSIDE KEEP AN EYE 
ON THE FORECAST AND I'LL KEEP YOU 
UPDATED ON THE PROSPECTS THAT IS 
THE B. B. C. LONDON FORECAST JUST 
BEFORE WE GO THE MAIN HEADLINES 
PICTURES HAVE EMERGED REVEALING THE 
DOUBLE LIFE OF JOSEF FRITZL THE 
AUSTRIAN WHO IMPRISONED HIS 
DAUGHTER AND FATHERED SEVEN 
CHILDREN BY HER DOCTORS IN THE U. S.

SUCCESSFULLY GROWN BACK PARTS OF 
SEVERED FINGERS FOR THE FIRST TIME

ANNUAL FALL IN HOUSE PRICES THE

HARROW COUNCIL HAS STARTED USING 
MOBILE C. C. T. V. CAMERAS TO CATCH 
PARENTS WHO PARK ILLEGALLY ON THE 
SCHOOL RUN AND AS WE HAVE SEEN

SWAY VOTERS WITH LAST DITCH 
CAMPAIGNING AHEAD OF POLLING
