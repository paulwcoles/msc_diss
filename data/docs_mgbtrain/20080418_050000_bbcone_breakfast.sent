GOOD MORNING THIS IS BREAKFAST 
ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST BANKS 
COULD ASK ITS SHAREHOLDERS FOR 
BILLIONS OF POUNDS TO HELP IT 
SURVIVE THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
THE BANK IS RBS THE OWNER OF 
NATWEST WHICH IS SEEKING TO REPAIR 
ITS FINANCES 
GOOD MORNING IT IS FRIDAY EIGHTEENTH 
APRIL APRIL POVERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT ARE 
BACK ON THE AGENDA FOR GORDON BROWN 
AS HE URGES AMERICA TO CREATE A 
GLOBAL SOCIETY 
SHOULD SOME DIABETICS THROW AWAY 
THEIR HOME TESTING KITS STUDIES 
SUGGEST THEY CAN MAKE PEOPLE LEAP 
PEOPLE DEPRESSED ABOUT THEIR 
CONDITION CONDITION IT IS A WARM WELCOME IN LAS VEGAS 
FOR JOE CALZAGHE AS HE GETS READY 
TO FACE OFF FOR ANOTHER WORLD TITLE 
ALSO A RETURN TO THE GOOD LIFE WE 
WILL FIND OUT WHAT IS PROMPTING THE 
REBIRTH OF GROW YOUR OWN 
FIRST BRITAIN'S SECOND LARGEST 
BANKING GROUP THE ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND IS CONSIDERING ASKING ITS 
SHAREHOLDERS TO HELP IT THROUGH THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH 
RBS LOOKS TO GENERATE BILLIONS OF 
POUNDS BY ISSUING NEW SHARES IT 
WOULD BE THE FIRST BRITISH BANK TO 
RAISE MONEY IN THIS WAY BUT OTHERS 
MAY FOLLOW SUIT 
IT IS EMBARRASSING FAR BANK TO 
ADMITTED TO SHORT OF MONEY BUT 
THAT IS THE POSITION OF THE ROYAL 
BANK OF SCOTLAND MAY SOON BE IN 
LAST YEAR THEY TOOK OVER A DUTCH 
BANK IN A MULTI BILLION POUND DEAL 
THAT ON THE CREDIT CRUNCH HAS PUT 
STRAIN ON ITS CASH RESERVES RBS 
SAID THEY WOULDN'T RULE OUT REPORTS 
THEY WERE CONSIDERING THE RIGHTS 
ISSUE 
CONSUMERS SHOULDN'T BE TOO ISSUE WORRIED ABOUT RBS IT IS A VERY 
CREDITABLE BUT IT HAS BEEN DAMAGED 
THEY ARE TAKING ACTION TO REPAIR 
THE STRENGTH OF THE CAPITAL TO MAKE 
SURE THEY ARE STRONGER OF THE OFF 
TO KEEP ON DEVELOPING 
WHAT IS A 
RIGHTS ISSUE IT IS A WAY OF 
RAISING MORE MONEY FOR COMPANY BY 
GIVING CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS THE 
RIGHT TO BUY MORE SHARES HE PRICE 
OF THE NEW SHARES IS ALMOST ALWAYS 
BELOW THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE IF 
A SHAREHOLDER DOES NOT WANT TO BUY 
THE SHARES THEY CAN PASS ON THAT 
RIGHT TO SOMEONE ELSE RBS MIGHT BE 
THE FIRST TO GO AHEAD WITH THE 
RIGHTS ISSUE BUT IT MAY NOT BE THE 
LAST THERE IS WIDESPREAD 
EXPECTATION IN THE CITY THAT OTHER 
BANKS MAY FOLLOW RBS THE BOSS ON 
THE LEFT WENT TO A MEETING WITH 
OTHER BANK EXECUTIVES AT DOWNING 
STREET ON TUESDAY RBS INDICATED A 
RIGHTS ISSUE WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY 
THERE MAY BE PRESSURE ON HIM NOW TO 
STEP DOWN

STOCK EXCHANGE GOOD MORNING HELP

IS ONE OF THE BIG BOYS IF THEY 
HAVE PROBLEMS IT IS TELLING US 
SOMETHING SOMETHING WE ARE NOT SAYING THERE IS A 
PROBLEM WITH THE FINANCES OF ROYAL 
BANK OF SCOTLAND OR OF NOT WEST WE 
ARE NOT SAYING THERE IS PROBLEM 
NATWEST IF YOU BANK WITH THEM OR 
NATWEST YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY 
BIT ABOUT YOUR OWN MONEY THIS IS 
ABOUT HOW THE COMPANY FUNDS ITSELF 
AT A CORPORATE LEVEL IT HAS BEEN 
STRETCHING ITS FINANCES BY TAKING 
RISKS IT MADE ITSELF INTO THE 
SECOND BIGGEST BANK IN THE COUNTRY 
BY TAKING OVER NATWEST IT IS 
SKILLED IN PLANNING BIG TAKEOVERS 
AND MAKING THEM WORK WHEN EVERYONE 
ELSE THINKS THEY WILL FAIL IT IS 
ANOTHER TAKEOVER THAT LEFT IT IN A 
LITTLE BIT OF A SPOT THEY 
ATTEMPTED TO TAKE OVER DUTCH BANK 
LAST YEAR AND IT COST FIFTY SEVEN MILLION 
THE BANK WAS BETTING DO RIGHTS ON 
THAT TAKEOVER BEING A SUCCESS THAT 
TAKEOVER ABSORB MONEY IT MIGHT BE 
USING FOR OTHER THINGS IT NEEDS TO 
FIND TOP OF CASH ELSEWHERE IT 
CANNOT GO ANYWHERE BECAUSE OF THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH SO THE LAST PEOPLE 
THEY TURN TO HIS SHAREHOLDERS THEY 
WILL OWN LITTLE BIT LESS OF THE 
BANK IF THEY DON'T PUT THEIR MONEY 
WHERE THEIR MOUTHS ARE 
FOR THE 
MOMENT THANKS VERY MUCH

TO COOK THIS EVENING 
IN NOVEMBER 
MR. BROWN WILL BE GAINING A NEW BEST 
FRIEND HE HAS USED HIS TIME IN 
WASHINGTON TO MEET THE PRESIDENTIAL 
HOPEFULS HE KNOWS HILLARY CLINTON 
WELL AND HAS MADE IT KNOWN HE LIKES 
HER ECONOMIC POLICIES WITH BARACK 
OBAMA THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT RUNNER 
IT WAS POLITE INTRODUCTIONS WITH 
TALK OF THERE CHILDREN AND WITH 
JOHN MCCAIN FOR REACQUAINTANCE OF 
A MAN HE KNOWS HE CAN DO BUSINESS 
WITH MR. BROWN IS MEETING THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN TO DISCUSS 
APPROACHES TO THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN 
BEFORE FLYING TO BOSTON TO GIVE A 
SPEECH TO ENCOURAGE AMERICA AND THE

A LEAD ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL 
POVERTY NO DOUBT A WELCOME 
DIVERSION FROM THE TAX REFORM 
OUTCRY BACK HOME 
THE VETERAN LABOUR M. P. GWYNETH 
DUNWOODY HAS DIED AGED SEVENTY SEVEN SHE WAS 
THE LONGEST WOMAN SERVING MEMBER OF 
PARLIAMENT SHE WAS MOST RECENTLY 
M. P. FOR CREWE AND NANTWICH SHE HAD 
A FORMIDABLE REPUTATION IN THE 
COMMONS AND BECAME CHAIRWOMAN OF 
THE TRANSPORT SELECT COMMITTEE 
SHE WAS ALWAYS HER OWN PERSON SHE 
WAS ALWAYS FIERCELY INDEPENDENT 
SHE WAS POLITICS AT ITS BEST 
GREAT PARLIAMENTARIAN AND AN EXPERT 
ON TRANSPORT SHE WILL BE SADLY 
MISSED IN ALL PARTS OF THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS AND FOR HER CONSTITUENTS IN 
CREWE SHE WAS A DEDICATED MEMBER 
OF PARLIAMENT WILL PERSONALLY 
MISS HER FOR THE INDEPENDENT VIEWS 
SHE BROUGHT TO ME AND FOR HER 
EXPERTISE IN SO MANY DIFFERENT 
EXPERTISE IN SO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS AS WELL AS HER COMMITMENT TO 
THE LABOUR PARTY AND THE CAUSE OF 
SOCIAL JUSTICE 
THE N. H. S. COULD BE WASTING UP TO ONE HUNDRED 
MILLION A YEAR BY ASKING PEOPLE 
WITH TYPE TWO DIABETES TO MONITOR 
THEIR BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS AT HOME 
TWO STUDIES SUGGEST HOME MONITORING 
KITS HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON LONG 
TERM HEALTH BUT CAN LEAD TO PEOPLE 
FEELING MORE ANXIOUS AND DEPRESSED 
ABOUT THEIR ILLNESS 
THIS MAN WOULDN'T BE WITHOUT HIS 
BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL MONITOR SINCE HE 
WAS DIAGNOSED HE HAS CHANGED HIS 
LIFESTYLE HE HAS TAKEN ON WALKING 
THIS WAS HIS VIDEO TO THE TRIP TO 
THE MOUNTAINS THAT ECUADOR HE 
KNOWS HE NEEDS TO EAT BETTER BUT 
BELIEVES HE NEEDS TO CHECK HIS 
BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS 
IF I HAD TO 
CHECK MYSELF AFTER TWO HOURS OF 
BEATING I WOULD KNOW WHAT MY 
BLOOD SUGAR IS AND IF THEY'RE NOT 
GOOD I CAN GO BACK TO THE DOCTOR 
AND ASK IF I NEED TO CHANGE MY 
MEDICATION OR EXERCISE MORE 
TODAY'S STUDIES QUESTION HOW 
EFFECTIVE THESE TESTS ARE THEY SAY 
THEY COST THE N. H. S. MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED 
MILLION A YEAR BUT THEY HAVE NO 
SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON BLOOD GLUCOSE 
LEVELS AND THEY CAN CAUSE 
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY THE AUTHORS 
SAY THE MONEY COULD BE BETTER SPENT 
HELPING PEOPLE EXERCISE MORE AND 
CHANGE THEIR LIFESTYLES BUT IT IS 
A CONTROVERSIAL ARGUMENT 
WE KNOW 
WITH DIABETES IF IT IS NOT SELF 
MANAGED OR APPROPRIATELY MONITORED 
IT CAN LEAD TO COMPLICATIONS SUCH 
AS HEART DISEASE AND STROKE WHICH 
CAN INCREASE THE COST IN THE LONG 
TERM FOR THE N. H. S. 
ABOUT ONE IN TWENTY FIVE 
OF US HAVE DIABETES WHETHER BLOOD 
SUGAR MONITORING HELPS MAY IN THE 
END BE AN INDIVIDUAL CHOICE 
ZIMBABWE'S MAIN OPPOSITION LEADER 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS TOLD THE B. B. C. 
THAT HIS MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC 
CHANGE WAS APPROACHED BY THE RULING 
ZANU P. F. PARTY ABOUT A TRANSITION OF 
POWER AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION HE SAID OFFICIALS FROM 
ROBERT MUGABE'S PARTY MADE THEIR 
APPROACH AFTER THEY REALISED THAT 
THEY HAD BEEN DEFEATED AT THE 
BALLOT BOX 
THEY STARTED BY 
APPROACHING US HAVE TO SAY LET'S 
TALK ABOUT TRANSITION WE GENUINELY 
FELT THEY WANTED TO DISCUSS THIS 
MATTERS 
WHEN YOU SAY THEY WHO MATTERS ZANU P. F. 
NOT ROBERT MUGABE HIMSELF ZANU P. F. OBVIOUSLY NOT HIS EMISSARIES CAME 
TO US AND I SENT TWO PEOPLE TO TALK 
TO THEM NOW THEY ARE SAYING WE 
APPROACH THEM 
GOOGLE IS POISED TO OVERTAKE I. T. V. AS 
THE BIGGEST SINGLE EARNER OF 
ADVERTISING REVENUE IN BRITAIN IT 
HAS ANNOUNCED A THIRTY PER CENT RISE IN 
WORLDWIDE PROFITS MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED FIFTY 
MILLION SO FAR THIS YEAR 
IT COULD BE ANY MEETING IN ANY 
LONDON AT AGENCY AND IN A WAY IT 
IS BECAUSE GOOGLE IS FAST BECOMING 
THE BIGGEST NOISE IN U. K. ADVERTISING 
HOW DOES A SURGE IN THE GOOGLE BOX 
END OF PUTTING MONEY IN ITS BANK 
ACCOUNT ITS U. K. BOSS EXPLAINED HOW 
THE PAGE LINKS ALONGSIDE SEARCH 
RESULTS GENERATED GROWING PILES OF 
CASH SO EVERY TIME I CLICK ON ONE 
OF THESE YOU DO EARN MONEY THAT THAT IS CORRECT ONE OF THE REASON THE 
INTERNET HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IS 
CONSUMERS ARE SPENDING TIME ONLINE 
BUT THE MEDIUM IS MEASURABLE YOU 
CAN MEASURE WHAT YOU HAVE SPENT 
WHAT YOU GET IN TERMS OF SALES ON 
THE INTERNET 
AT FIRST IT WAS 
THOUSANDS OF SMALL FIRMS WHO COULD 
NOT AFFORD TO ADVERTISE ELSEWHERE 
WHO USED GOOGLE NOW IT IS THE 
BIGGEST BRANDS AND GOOGLE IS 
THREATENING TO OVERTAKE BRITAIN'S 
BIGGEST COMMERCIAL TELEVISION 
CHANNEL AS A LEARNER HOURS OF 
ADVERTISING REVENUES 
GOOGLE HAS AN 
EIGHTY PER CENT SHARE OF THE ONLINE MARKET IN 
THE U. K. IT CAUSES SOME RESENTMENT 
BUT NO MORE THAN I. T. V. USED TO IN ITS 
HEYDAY 
THIS IS EARNING GOOGLE HUGE HEYDAY PROFITS BUT RAISING QUESTIONS ARE 
WHETHER ONE FIRM SHOULD BE QUITE SO 
POWERFUL IN THIS NEW INDUSTRY 
A TWENTY YEAR OLD MAN WHO WAS ARRESTED 
IN CONNECTION WITH THE RHYS JONES 
MURDER INQUIRY HAS BEEN CHARGED 
WITH ASSISTING AN OFFENDER JAMES

IN THE STATES 
HE HAS THE PERFECT 
RECORD FORTY FOUR VICTORIES FROM FORTY FOUR 
CONTESTS LAST YEAR'S WIN STRETCHED 
HIS REIGN AS SUPER MIDDLEWEIGHT 
CHAMPION TO ELEVEN YEARS AND TWENTY ONE FIGHTS 
ALL THAT SUCCESS HASN'T BROUGHT THE 
FAME AND RECOGNITION THAT JOE 
CALZAGHE FEELS HE DESERVES WHERE 
BETTER TO PUT THAT RIGHT HAD THAN 
HERE IN LAS VEGAS WHERE THE CHANCE 
TO RUB SHOULDERS WITH HOLLYWOOD IS 
JUST A FILM PREMIERE A WAVE WHAT 
DO YOU THINK OF HIS CHANCES ON 
SATURDAY 
I DON'T WANT TO SAY SATURDAY ANYTHING NO PREDICTIONS THEY ARE 
BOTH GREAT FIGHTERS 
THIS WOULDN'T 
BE LAS VEGAS WITHOUT TAKING A 
GAMBLE HE IS RISKING THAT 
UNBLEMISHED RECORD AGAINST BERNARD 
HOPKINS THE SELSIDE EXECUTIONER 
WHO SPENT FIVE YEARS IN JAIL FOR 
ARMED ROBBERY HE IS FORTY THREE AND HAS 
NOTHING TO LOSE FOR JOE CALZAGHE 
IT IS A CHANCE TO CEMENT HIS 
REPUTATION AS BRITAIN'S BEST BOXER

ENOUGH TO WIN THE GAME WE HUNG IN 
THERE AND KEPT AT IT WE WERE 
HOPING TO GET SOMETHING FROM IT A 
POINT AT THE END WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
GOOD RESULT 
IN THE EARLY HOURS OF 
SUNDAY MORNING JOE CALZAGHE PUT 
HIS PROFESSIONAL RECORD OF FORTY FOUR 
UNBEATEN FIGHTS ON THE LINE AS HE 
TAKES TO THE RING IN AMERICA FOR 
THE FIRST TIME HE TAKES ON BERNARD 
HOPKINS HE IS AWARE THAT TAKING 
THIS FIGHT WAS A GAMBLE BUT ADMITS 
THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE THAN LAS 
VEGAS FOR A LITTLE FLUTTER 
A RING IS A RING AT THE END OF THE 
DAY THAT IS ALWAYS THE RISK WHEN 
YOU COME AWAY FROM HOME AT SIDE OF 
YOUR COMFORT ZONE HAVE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
FAITH IN MY ABILITY L. AM NOT GOING 
TO COME HERE IF I THINK IT WILL BE 
CLOSE CLOSE SIX NATIONS CHAMPIONS WALES WILL 
DEFEND THEIR TITLE NEXT YEAR 
AGAINST GOTLAND THEY MAKE HISTORY 
WHEN THEY PLAY IN THE FIRST EVER 
GAME ON A FRIDAY BUT THEY TAKE 
PART IN A MATCH AGAINST FRANCE IN 
PARIS THAT KICKS OFF AT NINE O'CLOCK P. M. 
THAT MUCH WILL TAKE PLACE ON 
FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVENTH COMPETING IN THE 
OPEN ROUND WILL BE IRELAND AGAINST 
FRANCE WHILE ENGLAND OPEN UP 
AGAINST ITALY THAT WILL BE THE 
FIRST SIX NATIONS MATCH FOR THE NEW 
ENGLAND TEAM MANAGER MARTIN 
JOHNSON HE WAS PRESENTED HE WILL 
BE PRESENTED TO THE MEDIA FOR THE 
FIRST TIME TODAY HE WILL SHED SOME 
LIGHT ON WHO ELSE HE IS BRINGING IN 
ON THE COACHING FRONT AND HE IS 
AWARE OF THE TASK AHEAD 
IT IS A 
HUGE AMOUNT OF RESPONSIBILITY AND 
IT NEEDS TO BE DONE WELL L. AM 
LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING ON WITH 
IT AND TRYING TO DO A GOOD JOB IT 
IS NO GOOD PUTTING YOURSELF ON THE 
BACK BEFORE YOU HAVE DONE ANYTHING 
WE NEED TO GET ON WITH THE JOB OF 
COURSE I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT IT I 
HAVE PLAYED THE GAME 
ON THE DAY THE INDIAN CRICKET 
PREMIER LEAGUE LAUNCHERS THE 
ENGLAND AND WALES CRICKET BOARD 
COULD ACCEPT AN OFFER OVER THE NEXT 
FEW WEEKS FROM TEXAN BILLIONAIRE 
ALAN STANFORD FOR ONE OFF WINNER 
TAKES ALL T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY MATCH AGAINST 
THE WEST INDIES THERE IS ALSO A 
DISCUSSION FOR AN ENGLISH VERSION 
OF THE NEW PREMIER LEAGUE THE NEW 
STADIUM THE SIR VIVIAN RICHARDS 
STADIUM WAS THE MAIN STADIUM JUST 
BEFORE I GO THE JUMPER DEBATE 
WHERE DO YOU STAND UP ON THE 
JUMPER THE ENGLAND CRICKET TEAM 
FROM NEXT SEASON WILL HAVE EIGHT 
MAN MADE FIBRE SWEATER TO TAKE THE 
SWEAT AWAY FROM THEIR SKIN 
BUT IT HAS DIVIDED OPINION THE 
JUDICIOUS SAYING IT IS THE END OF 
AN ERA VERY SAD HE FEELS WEARING 
SUCH ADDITIONAL JUMPER MAKE YOU 
FEEL LIKE CRICKETER MICHAEL 
VAUGHAN SAID IT WAS BUGBEAR OF HIS HIS WHAT ABOUT YOUNGSTERS PRESUMABLY 
THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY A TICKET 
PRESUMABLY YES 
IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A 
PUSH TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WITH TYPE 
TWO DIABETES WHO ARE NOT TREATED WITH 
INSULIN TO MONITOR THEIR OWN 
LEVELS LEVELS REPORTS SAY SELF TESTING CAN DO 
MORE HARM THAN GOOD AND WASTE MONEY 
IN THE PROCESS 
LIBBY DOWLING HIS CARE ADVISER FOR 
DIABETES U. K. WHAT HAS THIS RESEARCH 
SHOWN US 
IT SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE WHO 
MONITOR THEIR BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL 
WHO HAVE TYPE TWO DIABETES BUT DON'T 
USE INSULIN GET MORE ANXIOUS AND 
DEPRESSED ABOUT THERE CONDITION SO SO IT IS COUNTER SUBJECT IT IS 
COUNTER PRODUCTIVE 
THAT IS WHAT COUNTER PRODUCTIVE THE REPORT SUGGEST YOU NEED TO BE 
LOOKING AT THE WIDER PICTURE THERE 
IS A NUMBER OF ASPECTS OF THE 
CONDITION WHICH CAN CAUSE PEOPLE TO 
FEEL ANXIOUS THE DIAGNOSIS CAN BE 
DISTRESSING FOR PEOPLE AS CAN THE 
PRESENCE OF ANY COMPLICATIONS FIFTY PER CENT 
OF PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE TWO 
DIABETES HAVE COMPLICATIONS ON 
DIAGNOSIS SO THEY ARE DEALING WITH 
A DOUBLE BLOW IF YOU ADD TO THAT 
THE POTENTIAL LIFESTYLE CHANGES IN 
ORDER TO MANAGE THE CONDITION 
THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS WHY YOU 
MIGHT FEEL ANXIOUS AND DEPRESSED 
NOT JUST THE MONITORING 
HIS THIS 
ONE OF THE MONITORING DEVICES THIS THIS IS A TYPICAL DEVICE SOMEONE WITH 
DIABETES WILL USE ONE OF THESE 
OFTEN ON A DAILY BASIS TO CHECK 
THEIR BLOOD COOKER AS LEVELS WHAT WHAT IS IT FOR WHAT WAS IT DESIGNED TO 
DO 
IT IS DESIGNED SO PEOPLE CAN BE DO CHECKING THEIR BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS 
BECAUSE THAT HELPS THEM MAKE D. A. P. 
DECISIONS ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF 
THE CONDITION 
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE 
ONE OF THOSE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE 
THE INFORMATION 
THAT RIGHT SELF 
MANAGEMENT IS NINETY FIVE PER CENT LOOKING AFTER 
DIABETES MANY PEOPLE COULD 
DIABETES THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL 
WHEN YOU EXPLAIN IT LIKE THAT YOU 
THINK IT IS NECESSARY YET THIS 
ADVICE IS SAYING IT IS AN 
UNNECESSARY EXPENSE 
OBVIOUSLY WE 
NEED TO THINK ABOUT EXPENSE IN 
HEALTH CARE BUT IT WOULD BE A 
SHAME TO MAKE SHORT TERM CUTS CAN 
PROVISION OF HEALTH CARE BASICALLY 
LOOKING AFTER DIABETES WELL IT 
MAKES YOU MORE LIKELY RATHER 
UNLIKELY TO DEVELOP ANY OF THE 
COMPLICATIONS THAT WILL HAVE A 
MASSIVE IMPACT ON N. H. S. SPENDING IN 
THE FUTURE AND ALSO ON THE QUALITY 
OF LIFE 
GORDON BROWN HAS LED THE TRIBUTES 
FOR THE VETERAN LABOUR M. P. GWYNETH 
DUNWOODY WHO DIED LAST NIGHT AT THE 
AGE OF SEVENTY SEVEN 
SPEAKING IN WASHINGTON THE PRIME 
MINISTER SAID HER CONTRIBUTION WILL 
BE GREATLY MISSED 
SHE WAS ALWAYS HER OWN PERSON 
FIERCELY INDEPENDENT SHE WAS 
POLITICS AT ITS BEST A GREAT 
PARLIAMENTARIAN AND AN EXPERT ON 
TRANSPORT SHE WILL BE MISSED IN 
ALL PARTS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
AND FOR HER CONSTITUENTS IN CREWE 
SHE WAS A DEDICATED MEMBER OF 
PARLIAMENT WHO WOULD DO EVERYTHING 
FOR THEM L. WILL PERSONALLY MISS 
HER FOR THE INDEPENDENT VIEWS SHE 
BROUGHT TO ME AND FOR HER EXPERTISE 
IN SO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS AS WELL 
AS HER COMMITMENT TO THE LABOUR 
PARTY AND THE CAUSE OF SOCIAL 
JUSTICE JUSTICE WITH US IS SOMEBODY WHO SPENT MANY 
YEARS AT WESTMINSTER WITH GWYNETH 
DUNWOODY TONY BENN A SAD LOSS 
I KNEW HER WHEN SHE WAS FIRST 
ELECTED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX SHE WANTS I WAS 
A MEMBER FOR BRISTOL SHE WAS A 
RIGHT WING MEMBER OF THE LABOUR 
PARTY IN THE YEARS SINCE LABOUR 
CAME TO POWER SHE EMERGED IN A NEW 
ROLE AS A PASSIONATE SUPPORTER OF 
PARLIAMENT AND CRITICAL OF THE WAY 
IT WAS MANAGED BY NEW LABOUR AND 
STOOD FOR THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
WHEN MICHAEL MOSTON WAS ELECTED 
SHE WAS OPPOSED TO PRIVATISATION 
SHE SAYS I HAVE NOT CHANGED BUT 
THE PARTY HAS SPUN AROUND ME VERY 
HIGHLY REGARDED AS PEOPLE IN THE 
HOUSE SHE SAID WHAT SHE MEANT AND 
MEANT WHAT SHE SAID 
VERY MUCH A 
LABOUR PARTY SUPPORTER MEMBER BUT 
FIERCELY INDEPENDENT

ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT BUT 
SHE WAS INDEPENDENT IN AN 
UNEXPECTED POINT OF VIEW LIKE ROY 
HATTERSLEY WHEN YOU LABOUR CAME IN 
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE LEFT 
OF THE PARTY WITHOUT HAVING CHANGED 
THAT IS WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT 
GWYNETH DUNWOODY THEY TRIED TO GET 
HER OFF THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE 
TRANSPORT COMMITTEE BUT THE 
MEMBERS RALLIED AROUND AND THE 
WHIPS WERE DEFEATED 
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK THE CURRENT CROP OF M. P.'S COULD

UP TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND YEAR THE METRIC 
CAUSED IT SHAKY DAY FOR MR. BROWN 
ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE GUARDIAN 
THERE IS AN IMAGE OF A SHIP THIS 
IS AN IMPORT I. N. D. TURBAN IT IS ON 
ITS WAY TO ZIMBABWE AND THERE IS 
NOTHING IT CAN DO IN DEVON THE 
DAILY MIRROR IS SUPPORTING WHAT IS 
HAPPENING WITH PER TRISHA GODDARD 
TRISHA GODDARD SHE HAS BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT HOW HARD IT WAS TO 
HEAR THE DIAGNOSIS SHE WAS 
INSPIRED BY KYLIE MINOGUE AND HER 
BATTLE AGAINST THE DISEASE ON THE 
DAILY TELEGRAPH THERE IS AN 
ENORMOUS PICTURE OF GORDON BROWN 
LOOKING ACROSS AT GEORGE BUSH THEY 
ARE ALSO GOING ON THE RBS STORY 
FINALLY THE INDEPENDENT AFTER 
DOLLY THE SHEEP A NEW SCIENTIFIC 
TECHNIQUE COULD BE USED TO SAVE 
DOOMED SPECIES LIKE THE WHITE RHINO 
THEY ARE ASKING COULD THIS MEAN A 
WORLD WITHOUT EXTINCTION THAT 
BRINGS TO AN END OUR PAPER REVIEW 
NOW WE CROSSOVER TO THE STOCK 
EXCHANGE AND VERY IMPORTANT STORY 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST BANKS IN BRITAIN 
IS LIKELY TO GO TO SHAREHOLDERS AND 
ASKED THEM TO STUMP UP SOMEWHERE 
BETWEEN FIVE BILLION AND TWELVE BILLION 
TO HELP IT THROUGH THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH THE RBS IS THE BANK IT 
MORNING IF YOU ARE A CUSTOMER WITH 
ANY OF THESE BANKS SHOULD YOU BE 
WORRIED GOOD MORNING 
NOTE IT IS A SHAREHOLDER ISSUE 
THIS IS NOT ANOTHER NORTHERN ROCK 
THEY ARE JUST THINLY CAPITALISED 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
BANKS HAVE TO 
RETAIN A CERTAIN CUSHION OF CASH 
HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF SEVENTY 
BILLION EUROS LAST YEAR ON THE 
BIGGEST BANK IN HOLLAND A. B. N. AMRO 
THEY HAVE THE SMALLEST COMMISSION 
OF ANY BANK IN EUROPE 
BECAUSE OF 
THE TAKEOVER THE KITTY IS BARE 
THEY ARE GOING TO DO THIS PROBABLY 
ONCE THEY COULD BE A FIGURE OF TEN 
BILLION IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 
SEE WHAT FIGURE THEY COME UP WITH 
HERE WILL STUMP UP 
NONE OF THE 
RIGHTS ISSUES HAVE FAILED IN ALL 
OF THESE CASES EXISTING 
SHAREHOLDERS AFTER HAVE PUT UP 
THE CASH WITH THE ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 
SEE WHETHER THE BANK OF CHINA WELL 
GET MORE INVOLVED 
WE HAVE ALREADY 
SEE THE CHINESE DO THIS WITH THE 
BIG AMERICAN BANKS AND TAKE STAKES 
WITH MORGAN STANLEY AND J. P. MORGAN 
OF 
IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT WILL OF HAPPEN IT WILL BE A GOOD 
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO TRY TO BITE 
IN 
IT OPENS THE DOOR FOR CHINESE IN STATE INVESTORS 
THEY ARE BUYING UP 
ASSETS PRETTY CHEAPLY IF THEY ARE 
DOING SO 
TWO OTHER BRITISH BANKS 
HAVE TO FOLLOW 
NOT THAT THE NAME 
MUST MOMENT AS JUSTIN SAID 
EARLIER IT IS NOT A RISK TO 
CUSTOMERS AND SAVERS 
IF THEY DO 
THIS DOES THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE HAD 
TO RESIGN

ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST BANKS 
COULD ASK SHAREHOLDERS FOR BILLIONS 
OF POUNDS TO HELP IT SURVIVE THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH 
THE OWNER OF THE ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND AND NATWEST COULD RAISE AS 
MUCH AS TWELVE MILLION TO STRENGTHEN 
ITS FINANCES 
GOOD MORNING 
ALSO AHEAD POVERTY AND ENVIRONMENT 
ARE BACK ON THE AGENDA FOR GORDON 
BROWN AS HE URGES AMERICA TO CREATE 
A GLOBAL SOCIETY 
SHOULD SOME DIABETICS THROWAWAY 
THEIR HOME TESTING KITS STUDIES 
SUGGEST THEY CAN MAKE PEOPLE 
EXCESSIVELY DEPRESSED ABOUT THEIR 
CONDITION CONDITION WE SPEAK TO PARENTS ABOUT AN ANSWER 
ABOUT A CONDITION SO RARE THEY 
ISN'T AN ANSWER 
TO US HE IS LOOKING SO GROWN UP 
OR WHEN HE GETS TO SCHOOL THE 
OTHER CHILDREN ARE TOWERING OVER 
HIM IT WILL BE WEIRD AGAIN

ON THE ROOF WE EXPLORE THE RISE OF

SMALLEST SPACES COUNT 
BRITAIN'S SECOND LARGEST BANKING 
GROUP THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND 
IS CONSIDERING ASKING ITS 
SHAREHOLDERS TO HELP IT THROUGH THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH IT IS THOUGHT RBS 
WHICH OWNS NATWEST HIS TRYING TO 
CREATE BILLIONS OF POUNDS TO ISSUE 
NEW SHARES IT IS THE FIRST BANK TO 
DO THIS OTHERS MAY FOLLOW SUIT 
IT IS EMBARRASSING FOR A BANK TO 
ADMIT IT IS SHORT OF MONEY BUT 
THAT IS THE POSITION THE ROYAL BANK 
OF SCOTLAND MAY SOON BE IN LAST 
YEAR THEY TOOK OVER PART OF A 
DUTCH BANK IN A MULTI MILLION POUND 
DEAL VAT AND THE CREDIT CRUNCH HAS 
PUT STRAIN ON ITS CASH RESERVES 
RBS SAID THEY WOULDN'T RULE OUT 
REPORTS THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERING 
A RIGHTS ISSUE 
CONSUMERS SHOULDN'T 
BE WORRIED ABOUT RBS IT IS A 
PROFITABLE BANK BUT IT HAS BEEN 
DAMAGED BY THE CREDIT CRISIS THEY 
ARE TAKING ACTION TO REPAIR THEIR 
BALANCE SHEET TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE 
STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP ON DEVELOPING 
WHAT IS A RIGHTS ISSUE IT IS WAY 
OF RAISING MORE MONEY FOR COMPANY 
BY GIVING CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS THE 
RIGHT TO BUY MORE SHARES THE PRICE 
OF THE NEW SHARES IS USUALLY BELOW 
THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE IF A 
SHAREHOLDER DOESN'T WANT TO BUY THE 
SHARES THEY CAN PASS ON THE RIGHT 
TO SOMEONE ELSE RBS MAY BE THE 
FIRST BRITISH BANK TO GO AHEAD WITH 
THE RIGHTS ISSUE BUT IT MAY NOT BE 
THE LAST THERE IS WIDESPREAD 
EXPECTATION IN THE CITY THAT THE 
BANKS MAY FOLLOW RBS BOSC ON THE 
LEFT HERE WENT TO A MEETING WITH 
OTHER BANK EXECUTIVES AT DOWNING 
STREET ON TUESDAY RBS INDICATED A 
RIGHTS ISSUE WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY 
THEY MAY BE PRESSURE ON HIM NOW TO 
STEP DOWN 
WE CAN GET MORE DETAIL WITH DECLAN 
AT THE STOCK EXCHANGE 
JUST CLARIFY THE LINK BETWEEN RBS 
AND THE IDEA OF A RIGHTS ISSUE AND 
CONSUMERS CONSUMERS WE CAN GO THROUGH QUESTIONS THAT 
MIGHT BE IN YOUR HEAD IF YOU ARE 
ON ACCOUNT HOLDER WITH THE ROYAL 
BANK OF SCOTLAND NATWEST OR THE 
ULSTER BANK IS YOUR MONEY SAVED 
YES IT IS THIS DOES NOT AFFECT YOU 
AS A CUSTOMER THIS IS JUST A STORY 
FOR SHAREHOLDERS IS THE RBS GROUP 
IN FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES NO IT 
IS NOT WHY IS IT THINKING OF 
RAISING UP TO TWELVE BILLION IT IS 
BECAUSE THE RESERVE EVERY BANK HAS 
TO KEEP FOR ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND 
IS NOT AS FAT AS IT COULD BE IT 
HAS LOOKED AT IT AND ITS COMPANY 
SHAREHOLDERS IN THE CITY HAVE 
LOOKED AT IT AS WELL THE DECISION 
IS TO FATTEN UP THAT RESERVE A 
LITTLE BIT PARTLY BECAUSE IT 
SPENDS SO MUCH MONEY ON THAT 
TAKEOVER BID LAST YEAR SO 
SHAREHOLDERS WILL BE ASKING TO PAY 
UP TWELVE BILLION TO GIVE RBS BETTER 
CAPITALISATION IN THE BANKING 
INDUSTRY WHERE IS THAT MONEY GOING 
TO COME FROM FROM SHAREHOLDERS AS 
I SAY BUT IF THEY ARE OFFERING 
MORE SHARES TO THE MARKET AND NOT 
EVERY SHAREHOLDER TAKES UP THE 
RIGHT SHARES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR 
OTHER INVESTORS AND WE HAVE ALREADY 
SEEN THE CHINESE STATE INVESTMENT 
VEHICLES TAKE STAKES IN THE BIG 
AMERICAN BANKS WHEN THEY HAVE DONE 
SIMILAR THINGS THIS YEAR DON'T 
RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY YOU COULD 
SEE A MAJOR CHINESE INVESTMENT AS 
WELL WELL GORDON BROWN FLIES TO BOSTON TODAY

POLITE INTRODUCTIONS WITH TALK OF 
THEIR CHILDREN WITH JOHN MCCAIN A 
REACQUAINTANCE WITH A MAN HE IS 
KNOWN HE CAN FEEL HE CAN DO 
BUSINESS WITH IT IS THE FINAL LEG 
OF HIS TRIP TODAY AND HIS MEETING 
WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN 
TO DISCUSS APPROACHES TO THE

THE N. H. S. COULD BE WASTING UP TO ONE HUNDRED 
MILLION A YEAR BY ASKING PATIENTS 
WITH TYPE TWO DIABETES TO MONITOR THE 
CONDITION AT HOME TWO STUDIES 
SUGGEST HOME MONITORING KITS HAVE 
LITTLE EFFECT AND MAKE PEOPLE 
DEPRESSED ABOUT THEIR ILLNESS 
THIS MAN WOULDN'T BE WITHOUT HIS 
BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL MONITOR SINCE HE 
WAS DIAGNOSED HE HAS COMPLETELY 
CHANGED HIS LIFESTYLE HE HAS TAKEN 
A WALKING THIS IS HIS VIDEO ON HIS 
TRIP TO THE MOUNTAINS OF ECUADOR 
HE BELIEVES HE NEEDS TO KEEP 
TESTING HIS BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS IF IF I CHECKED MYSELF AFTER TWO HOURS OF 
EATING I WOULD KNOW WHAT MY BLOOD 
SUGARS ARE AND IF THEY ARE NOT 
GOOD I CAN GO BACK TO THE DOCTOR 
AND SAY DO I NEED TO CHANGE MY 
MEDICATION OR NEED TO EXERCISE MORE 
AND BE MORE ACTIVE 
TODAY'S STUDIES 
QUESTION HOW EFFECTIVE THESE TESTS 
ARE THEY SAY THEY COST THE N. H. S. 
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR BUT 
THEY HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON 
BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS AND CAN CAUSE 
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY 
THE AUTHORS SAY THE MONEY CAN BE 
BETTER SPENT HELPING PEOPLE 
EXERCISE MORE AND CHANGE THEIR 
LIFESTYLES BUT IT IS A 
CONTROVERSIAL ARGUMENT WITH WITH DIABETES IF IT IS NOT SELF MANAGED 
OR APPROPRIATELY MONITORED IT CAN 
LEAD TO COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS HEART 
DISEASE AND STROKE WHICH CAN 
INCREASE IN THE LONG TERM FOR THE 
N. H. S. 
ABOUT ONE IN TWENTY FIVE OF US HAVE N. H. S. DIABETES WHETHER BLOOD SUGAR

WE HAVE SOMEONE SPECIAL IN THE 
STUDIO LIAM SMYTH IS THREE YEARS 
OLD AND SUFFERS FROM A RARE GENETIC 
DISORDER HE IS AND GROWING UP IN 
SIZE THE GENE RESPONSIBLE HAS ONLY 
JUST BEEN DISCOVERED AND HAS HIS 
PARENTS ON A MISSION TO FIND OTHERS 
WHO MAY BE AFFECTED HE HAS COME TO 
THE STUDIO THIS MORNING MORNING 
FIRST WE CAN LOOK AT LIAM AT HIS 
FIRST DAY IN NURSERY 
PRESS FOR BOLTON 
IT IS A BIG DAY IN HIS LIFE AN 
EMOTIONAL ONE FOR HIS MUM AND DAD 
BUTTON 
IT IS HIS FIRST DAY AT THE NURSERY 
HE IS STARTING TO COMPARE HIMSELF 
ALREADY TO HAVE THE KIDS HE IS 
ONLY THREE L. HOPE HE CAN DO THINGS 
LIKE THAT ALL HIS LIFE THEY ARE 
JUST AVERAGE SIZED KIDS BUT HE 
KEEPS SAYING THEY ARE MONSTERS 
HER HER WE THINK LIAM IS A NORMAL 
HE HAS SUCH A BIG PERSONALITY BUT 
SOMETIMES YOU FORGET HOW LITTLE HIS 
BODY IS 
IT IS A BIGGER STEP FOR ME LETTING 
GO OF HIM THAN IT IS FOR ANYBODY 
ELSE I DON'T WANT TO DO IT WHY WHY HE IS MINE HE IS SPECIAL AND I 
DON'T WANT TO SHARE HIM 
THAT WAS HARD TO WATCH MARY NICE 
TO MEET YOU L. THINK YOU ARE A BIT TIRED 
HE HAD A BAD NIGHT LAST TIRED NIGHT 
WHEN DID YOU REALISE LIAM NIGHT WAS AFFECTED IN A WAY THAT LESS 
THAN ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE 
AFFECTED 
WE KNEW WHEN I WAS AFFECTED PREGNANT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG 
BECAUSE HE WAS HALF THE SIZE BUT 
WE DID NOT KNOW UNTIL JANUARY LAST 
YEAR WHEN HE WAS TWO AND A HALF 
THAT HE HAD MOPD TYPE TWO 
HOW BIG 
WAS HE WHEN HE WAS BORN THREELB THREELB AND I COULD HOLD HIM IN MY HAND 
HE IS SO SMALL YOU COULD SEE FROM 
THE FILM YOU AS PARENTS IT MUST 
BE SO WORRYING FOR YOU HOW HE IS 
GOING TO DEAL WITH THINGS THAT FOR 
OTHER PEOPLE IS COMPLETELY NORMAL 
IT IS NOT SO WORRYING NOW BECAUSE 
HE HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED THE UNKNOWN 
WAS MORE SCARY AND NOW WE KNOW WE 
KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR THERE ARE 
SYMPTOMS 
WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD APART 
FROM THE FACT THAT HE IS LITTLE AND 
HE IS NEVER GOING TO GROW MORE THAN 
THE SIZE OF AN AVERAGE THREE YEAR 
OLD ARE THAT OTHER IMPLICATIONS 
FOR HIS HOUSE 
HE'D JUST DO NOT 
KNOW HEALTH YOU JUST DO NOT 
KNOW WE WANT TO FIND MORE FAMILIES 
WE BELIEVE THERE ARE MORE OUT THERE 
SOME CHILDREN HAVE GOT TO MAYBE 
ADULT HAD BEFORE THEY HAVE BEEN 
DIAGNOSED ADULT HOOD THE WORLD 
IS CHANGING SO FAST IT IS GOING TO 
GROW AND GROW WE THOUGHT LIAM WAS 
THE ONLY ONE AND THERE WAS NO CHILD 
LIKE HIM NOW WE BELIEVE THERE ARE 
SIX IN THIS COUNTRY AND MAYBE MORE 
BUT ALL UNDIAGNOSED 
THESE ARE THE 
ONES THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY 
CONFIRMED 
I CAN SEE HE IS ABOUT TO CONFIRMED NOD OFF THIS IS HIS THIRD BIRTHDAY 
PARTY IT MUST HAVE BEEN GREAT FUN 
IT WAS BRILLIANT WE WERE TOLD A 
LOT OF CHILDREN WITH HIS CONDITION 
HAD STROKES AND ANEURISMS A CHILD

OUT LOUD WE DID NOT KNOW BEFORE 
HE WAS DIAGNOSED WE WERE TOLD HE 
MIGHT NOT LIVE THROUGH THE 
PREGNANCY EVERY LITTLE HURDLE AND 
EVERY MILESTONE IN LIFE THAT YOU

STAR STEPHEN WILLS WAS A MAN WHO 
NEEDED HELP HE WAS KNOCKED OFF HIS 
BIKE IN MANCHESTER BY CAR THAT 
DID NOT STOP AND LEFT HIM LYING 
INJURED IN THE ROAD 
TRAGICALLY THERE WAS NO ONE 
WILLING TO BE HIS SAMARITAN AS HE 
LAY DYING SO MOTORISTS DROVE 
AROUND HIS BODY POLICE THINK 
SOMEONE EVEN DROVE OVER HIS LEGS 
HE DID NOT SURVIVE HIS HEAD 
INJURIES INJURIES I KNOW IT IS A ROUGH NEIGHBOURHOOD 
AND I KNOW PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT 
STOPPING THEIR CARS BUT JUST A NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
CALL OR STOPPING YOUR CAR IN 
ELAINE AND STOPPING OTHER CARS FROM 
RUNNING OVER HIM HE COULD STILL BE 
ALIVE TODAY 
HOW CAN DYING MAN BE IGNORED BY SO MANY PEOPLE 
START US OFF ON THIS IT DOES SEEM 
EXTRAORDINARY IN THE FACE OF IT 
PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO WALK ON BY 
I THINK THERE IS A BIT OF MORAL 
PANIC THIS WAS A STORY IN THE 
DAILY MAIL WHO LOVE STUFF LIKE 
THIS IT WAS THREE THIRTY AM ON A DUAL 
CARRIAGEWAY AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT 
PEOPLE SAW OR DID NOT SEE L. THINK 
WE HAVE A GREAT APPETITE FOR 
STORIES THAT SUGGEST WE ARE ALL 
GOING TO HELL THERE IS MUCH LESS 
APPETITE FOR THOSE STORIES DOING 
TERRIFIC STUFF HEROIC ACTS 
WONDERFUL THINGS BUT SOMEHOW WE 
AND WE HAVE DONE SO 
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME WE ARE 
MUCH MORALLY WORSE THAN WE WERE IN 
OUR GRANDPARENTS GENERATION THERE 
IS NOT A LOT OF EVIDENCE NOT IN 
CRIME FIGURES OR THE NUMBERS OF 
PEOPLE VOLUNTEERING DOING GREAT 
THINGS THINGS HOWEVER IF PEOPLE DEAD THE IDEA 
OF THE STORY IS PEOPLE DIDN'T 
REALISE WHAT HAPPENED BUT PEOPLE 
DID DRIVE ON AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT 
PEOPLE ACTUALLY SAW BUT IS THERE 
EVIDENCE PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT TO 
STOP ONCE ONE PERSON HAS NOT 
STOPPED MORE PEOPLE ARE MORE 
RELUCTANT 
THERE IS A CULTURE OF RELUCTANT FEAR AND AS POLLY SAYS IT IS NOT 
BASED ON ANYTHING SOLID ONE REPORT 
SAYS CRIME HAS DROPPED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
BY FORTY PER CENT YET SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE FEEL 
THERE IS MORE VIOLENT CRIME A LOT 
OF THIS PERCEPTION COMES FROM THE 
MEDIA THE MEDIA CHOOSES WHAT THEY 
CONSIDER TO BE NEWSWORTHY IN A WAY 
THE PERCEPTION CREATE THE FACT THE THE B. B. C. LEADS ON CRIME STORIES AND 
LINGERS ON THEM MUCH MORE THAN IT 
DID DESPITE THE FACT THERE IS LESS 
AND CRIMEWATCH SCARES THE LIVING 
DAYLIGHTS OUT OF PEOPLE THEY NEVER 
SAY THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY RARE 
IT IS VERY HARD TO QUANTIFY THIS 
THING WHETHER WE HELP EACH OTHER 
MORE OR LESS ANECDOTALLY YOUR OWN 
EXPERIENCE DO YOU GET A SENSE 
PEOPLE ARE LESS WILLING TO STEP 
FORWARD THAN THEY USED TO BE YOU 
HAVE A SENSE IN THE PLACE WHERE 
YOU LIVE IF YOU FALL OVER TO 
SOMEBODY COME AND HELP YOU DO 
SOMEBODY PICK UP YOUR WALLET YES YES AND NO THE CRUCIAL THING IS MORE 
THAN THEY USED TO THERE IS VERY 
LITTLE SOCIAL HISTORY THAT HAS YOU 
IN DETAIL EXACTLY HOW PEOPLE 
BEHAVE TO EACH OTHER THIRTY FORTY FIFTY 
YEARS AGO AUTOBIOGRAPHIES BY 
POLICE HE CASUALLY CASUALLY 
DESCRIBES A WORLD WITH MORE 
VIOLENCE WHICH THE POLICE DID NOT 
CARE ABOUT VERY MUCH PEOPLE 
FIGHTING OUTSIDE PUBS AND THINGS 
IF YOU READ THE MASS OBSERVATION 
REPORTS DURING THE LAST WAR THE 
IDEAS EVERYBODY PULL TOGETHER 
ACTUALLY THERE WAS A LOT OF 
MEANNESS GOING ON BETWEEN 
NEIGHBOURS I SUSPECT HUMANITY IS 
ALWAYS GOOD AND BAD IN EVERY ERA 
ALTHOUGH FASHIONS MAY CHANGE AS TO 
WHAT CRIMES ARE COMMITTED 
IN A SMALL COMMUNITY IF SOMEBODY 
DROVE AWAY SOMEBODY WOULD KNOW 
PEOPLE HAVE SENSE OF BEING 
SEPARATE WE HAVE A SENSE OF 
LOOKING OUT FOR OURSELVES RATHER 
THAN THE COMMUNITY BY DISCUSSING 
THIS WE ARE REINFORCING IT L. 
WOULD LIKE TO THINK HOW ARE WE 
GOING TO CHANGE THIS 
ONE OF THE 
REASONS THIS TERRIBLE STORY STRIKES 
A CHORD IS TO SAY WOULD WEEK IN 
THAT SITUATION HAVE STOPPED TO 
HELP HAVE WE MAY BE SEEN A DRUNKEN 
MAN LYING ON THE STREET AND 
THOUGHT 
I LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE THOUGHT THERE ARE A LOT OF TRUNK PEOPLE 
ABOUND WITH THEIR CANS OF BEER 
SOME OF WHOM WE KNOW QUITE WELL BY 
SIGHT I WOULD NOT DREAM OF CALLING 
NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE ONE OF THEM MAY BE DYING AND 
HOW IS ONE TO KNOW SOMETIMES SOMETIMES REWARDS TO COME QUICKLY L. WENT TO 
HELP SOMEBODY IN A WHEELCHAIR L. 
WAS GOING TO HELP AND I DREW BACK 
THERE IS AN AMBIVALENCE HIS WIFE 
CAME ALONG AND SAID THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH TWO MINUTES LATER I AM AT 
THE END OF A CAR PARK AND THIS 
WOMAN SAID THAT IS HER THERE IS 
THE NICE LADY SHE HAD SEEN THE 
SHOP KEEPER AND ASKED HIM TO HAND 
BACK MY CREDIT CARD WHICH I HAD 
LEFT BEHIND 
WATCHING BREAKFAST 
THE MAIN STORIES THE ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND IN HIS CONSIDERING ASKING 
ITS SHAREHOLDERS FOR MILLIONS OF 
POUNDS TO HELP IT THROUGH THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH

ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST BANKS 
COULD ASK ITS SHAREHOLDERS FOR 
BILLIONS OF POUNDS TO HELP IT 
SURVIVE THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
THE OWNER OF ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND 
AND NATWEST IS EXPECTED TO ASK FOR 
UP TO TWELVE BILLION TO STRENGTHEN ITS 
FINANCES 
GOOD MORNING IT'S FRIDAY EIGHTEENTH 
APRIL APRIL ALSO AHEAD 
SHOULD SOME DIE BETICS THROW AWAY 
THEIR HOME TESTING KITS 
NO TAKING PICTURES IN PUBLIC HOW 
ANTI TERRORISM MEASURES ARE BEING 
USED TO STOP AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHERS 
PRACTISING THEIR HOBBY 
ALSO BEFORE THE END OF THE 
PROGRAMME THIS MORNING HOLLYWOOD 
ACTOR 
TO 
TELL US WHY HE 
GOT TIME FOR 
THE BLUES IN HIS LATEST FILM 
AND A RECORD BREAKING RECEPTION FOR 
RECORD MAKING RECEPTIONIST 
ALSO THAT STILL TO COME 
BRITAIN'S SECOND LARGEST BANKING 
GROUP THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND 
IS CONSIDERING ASKING ITS 
SHAREHOLDERS TO HELP IT THROUGH THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH IT'S IT'S THOUGHT 
THE RBS MAY GENERATE BILLIONS OF 
POUNDS BY ISSUING SHARES 
OTHERS MAY FOLLOW SUIT 
DECLAN CAN TELL US MORE 
PEOPLE STRAIGHTAWAY WILL START TO 
WORRY CUSTOMERS CONSUMERS WHAT 
CAN YOU TELL US 
THEY MAY WORRY BUT 
THEY SHOULDN'T IF YOU'RE A 
CUSTOMER WITH ANY OF THE BANKS THAT 
RBS OWNS BE THAT ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND OR NATWEST OR THE ULSTER 
BANK THEN YOUR MONEY IS SAFE THIS 
ISN'T A STORY ABOUT MORTGAGES OR 
SAVINGS OR THE SECURITY OF YOUR 
ACCOUNT THIS IS PURELY ABOUT HOW 
THE COMPANY FUNDS ITSELF AS A 
LISTED COMPANY ALL BANKS ARE 
REQUIRED TO HAVE A CUSHION OF CASH 
TO GET THEM THROUGH BAD TIMES LIKE 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH HAS LASTED A LOT LONGER THAN 
PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD IT'S 
HAVING A BIGGER IMPACT ON BANKS 
THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD SO 
RBS HAS GONE BACK AND LOOKED AT HOW 
MUCH MONEY IT'S GOT IN ITS 
PROTECTIVE CUSHION AND WE ARE TOLD 
IT'S DECIDED IT NEEDS TO PUT A BIT 
EXTRA MONEY INTO THAT NOW 
RESERVES ARE A LITTLE BIT THIN AT 
RBS BECAUSE IT SPENT A LOT OF MONEY 
LAST YEAR ON A BIG MULTI BILLION 
POUND TAKE OVER A FIFTY BILLION DEAL 
IT TAKE OVER THE DUTCH BANK A. B. N. 
AMRO BUT DON'T FORGET OTHER BANKS 
IN THE U. S. HAVE DONE THIS ALREADY 
U. B. S. THE SWISS BANK HAS DONE THIS 
AS WELL SO RBS IS JUST THE FIRST 
BRITISH BANK TO GO BACK TO ITS 
SHAREHOLDERS AND SAY THAT THEY NEED 
TO PUT A BIT MORE MONEY TO ONE SIDE 
TO GET THEM THROUGH THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH 
THANKS VERY MUCH CRUNCH GORDON BROWN FLIES TO BOSTON TODAY 
WHERE HE WILL CALL ON INTERNATIONAL 
INSTITUTIONS TO TAKE THE LEAD ON 
TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL 
POVERTY IT'S THE FINAL LEG OF HIS 
THREE DAY VISIT TO THE U. S. AND COMES 
AFTER HE HAD TALKS WITH GEORGE W. 
BUSH AND THE THREE LEADING 
CANDIDATES TO SUCCEED HIM AS 
PRESIDENT PRESIDENT THE N. H. S. COULD BE WASTING UP TO ONE HUNDRED 
MILLION A YEAR BY ASKING PEOPLE 
WITH TYPE TWO DIABETES TO MONITOR 
THEIR BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS AT HOME 
TWO STUDIES PUBLISHED IN THE 
BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL SHOW THAT 
HOME MONITORING KITS HAVE LITTLE 
EFFECT ON LONG TERM HEALTH BUT CAN 
HELP PEOPLE FEEL ANXIOUS ABOUT 
THEIR ILLNESS SURJEET SOIN 
WOULDN'T BE WITHOUT HIS BLOOD SUGAR 
LEVEL MONITOR SINCE HE WAS 
DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES HE HAS 
COMPLETELY CHANGED HIS LIFESTYLE 
HE HAS TAKEN UP WALKING THIS IS 
HIS VIDEO TO HIS TRIP TO THE 
MOUNTAINS OF ECUADOR HE'S CAREFUL 
TO EAT BETTER HE BELIEVES HE NEEDS 
TO KEEP TESTING HIS BLOOD SUGAR 
LEVELS LEVELS IF I HAVE TO CHECK MYSELF AFTER TWO 
HOURS OF EATING I WOULD KNOW WHAT 
MY BLOOD SUGARS ARE IF THEY'RE NOT 
GOOD I CAN GO BACK TO THE DOCTORS 
AND SAY MY BLOOD SUGARS ARE NOT 
HIGH DO I NEED CHANGE MY 
MEDICATION OR DO I NEED TO EXERCISE 
MORE AND BE MORE ACTIVE BUT BUT TODAY'S STUDIES QUESTION HOW 
EFFECTIVE THESE TESTS ARE THEY SAY 
THEY COST THE N. H. S. MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED 
MILLION A YEAR YET THEY HAVE NO 
SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON BLOOD GLUCOSE 
LEVELS AND THEY CAN CAUSE 
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY 
THE AUTHORS SAY THE MONEY COULD BE 
BETTER SPENT HELPING PEOPLE 
EXERCISE MORE AND CHANGE THEIR 
LIFESTYLES BUT IT'S A 
CONTROVERSIAL ARGUMENT 
WE KNOW 
WITH DIABETES IF IT'S NOT SELF 
MANAGED IF IT'S NOT APPROPRIATELY 
MONITORED IT CAN LEAD TO 
COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS HEART DISEASE 
AND STROKE WHICH CAN INCREASE THE 
COST IN THE LONG TERM FOR THE N. H. S. 
ABOUT ONE IN TWENTY FIVE OF US LIKE SURJEET 
HAVE DIABETES WHETHER BLOOD SUGAR 
MONITORING HELPS MAY IN THE END BE 
AN INDIVIDUAL CHOICE 
THE VETERAN LABOUR M. P. GWYNETH 
DUNWOODY HAS DIED AGED SEVENTY SEVEN SHE WAS 
THE LONGEST SERVING WOMAN MEMBER OF 
PARLIAMENT MISS DUNWOODY WAS MOST 
RECENTLY M. P. FOR CREWE AND NANTWICH

GOOGLE IS POISED TO OVERTAKE I. T. V. ONE 
AS THE BIGGEST SINGLE EARNER OF 
ADVERTISING REVENUE IN BRITAIN THE 
INTERNET HAS ANNOUNCED A THIRTY PER CENT RISE 
IN WORLDWIDE PROFITS MORE THAN 
SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SO FAR 
SO FAR THIS YEAR SEVEN IT COULD BE 
ANY MEETING IN ANY BIG LONDON AD 
AGENCY AND IN A WAY IT IS BECAUSE 
GOOGLE IS FAST BECOMING THE BIGGEST 
NOISE IN U. K. ADVERTISING HOW DOES A 
SEARCH IN THAT GOOGLE BOX END UP 
PUTTING MONEY IN ITS BANK ACCOUNT 
WHY DON'T WE TRY RED PULLOVER O. K. O. K. THE FIRM'S U. K. BOSS EXPLAINED HOW 
THE PAID LINKS ALONGSIDE SEARCH 
RESULTS GENERATED GROWING POTS OF 
CASH SO EVERY TIME I CLICK ON ONE 
OF THESE YOU EARN SOME MONEY 
THAT'S CORRECT 
ONE OF THE REASONS THE INTERNET HAS 
BEEN SUCCESSFUL AS AN ADVERTISING 
MEDIUM IS FIRST CONSUMERS ARE 
SPENDING THEIR TIME ON LINE BUT 
SECOND THE MEDIUM IS MEASURABLE 
SO YOU CAN MURL WHAT YOU'VE SPENT 
WHAT YOU GET IN TERMS OF SALES ON 
THE INTERNET VERY DIRECTLY AT AT FIRST IT WAS JUST THOUSANDS OF 
SMALL FIRMS WHO COULDN'T AFFORD TO 
ADVERTISE ELSEWHERE WHO USED GOOGLE 
NOW THOUGH IT'S THE BIGGEST 
BRANDS TOO GOOGLE IS THREATENING 
TO OVERTAKE BRITAIN'S BIGGEST 
COMMERCIAL T. V. CHANNEL AS AN EARNER 
OF ADVERTISING REVENUES 
GOOGLE HAS AN EIGHTY PER CENT SHARE OF THE ON 
LINE MARKET IN THE U. K. IT'S VERY 
DOMINANT IT CAUSES SOME RESENTMENT 
BUT NO MORE RESENTMENT THAN I. T. V. 
USED TO IN ITS HEYDAY GOOGLE'S GOOGLE'S SKILL IS EARNING PROFITS BUT ALSO 
RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER ONE 
FIRM SHOULD BE QUITE SO POWERFUL IN 
THIS VITAL NEW INDUSTRY 
NEW PICTURES SHOWING PRINCE CHARLES 
AS A BOY HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC FOR 
THE FIRST TIME PHOTOS ARE INCLUDED 
IN A BIOGRAPHY TO MARK HIS SIXTIETH 
BIRTHDAY LATER THIS YEAR THEY 
INCLUDE RARELY SEEN IMAGES OF 
CHARLES AGED FIVE AT BALANCE MORAL 
AND WITH HIS SISTER PRINCESS ANNE 
THEY ALSO SHOW DETAILS OF A NOTE 
WRITTEN TO HIS GRANNY THE QUEEN 
MOTHER OF COURSE LOTS OF HUGS AND 
KISSES THERE 
THOSE ARE THIS MORNING'S TOP 
STORIES COMING UP BEFORE EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THE 
DISAPPEARING DISHES COULD OUR 
CHANGING TASTES MEAN THE EXTINCTION 
OF THE LIKES OF LAVA BREAD WHICH 
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF AND STOTTY 
CAKES IT'S MAKING ME FEEL PECKISH 
WHEN JOHN KELLY SNAPPED PICTURES OF 
A STREET SCENE IN BLACKPOOL FOR A 
PHOTO COMPETITION HE WAS STOPPED BY 
A POLICE OFFICER AND ASKED TO 
DELETE HIS SHOTS JOHN WAS DOING 
NOTHING ILLEGAL AND HAD EVERY RIGHT 
TO TAKE PHOTOS IT SEEMS HE WAS A 
VICTIM OF A GROWING CONCERN OVER 
THE WAY LESS REPUTABLE PEOPLE LIKE 
TERRORISTS OR PAEDOPHILES MIGHT BE 
USING THEIR CAMERAS SOME M. P.'S ARE 
NOW SO WORRIED ABOUT THIS THEY'RE 
CALLING FOR POLICE FORCES TO BE 
GIVEN CLEARER INSTRUCTIONS ON WHAT 
THEY SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T DO JOHN 
KELLY WHOSE PHOTO SPARKED POLICE 
SUSPICION JOINS US NOW ALONG WITH 
CHRIS CHEESMAN WHO IS NEWS EDITOR 
OF AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER MAGAZINE 
GOOD MORNING 
JOHN YOU'VE BROUGHT YOUR CAMERA 
ALONG WITH YOU TELL US WHAT 
HAPPENED WHAT WERE YOU TAKING 
PICTURES OF AND WHAT DID THE POLICE 
OFFICER SAY 
I WAS TAKING LONG 
SHOTS OF STREET SCENES THEY WERE 
FOR A COMPETITION RUN BY BLACKPOOL 
COUNCIL I'VE BEEN ON A COURSE AT 
THE LOCAL COLLEGE AND A POLICE 
OFFICER APPROACHED ME AND ASKED ME 
WHAT I WAS DOING L. TOLD HER I WAS 
TAKING PHOTOS AND SHE SAID I 
COULDN'T ASK WITHOUT ASKING 
PERMISSION OF THE PUBLIC 
HAD YOU 
TAKEN A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM 
IT WAS A 
LADY I HAD FURTHER IMAGES UP THE 
ROAD OF A YELLOW JACKETS SHE SAID 
I HAD IMAGES OF HER AND SHE WANTED 
ME TO DELETE THEM L. SHOWED HER THE 
IMAGES AND I SAID I'M SURE YOU 
WRONG BUT SHE ASKED TO SEE L. DID 
DELETE THEM TO AVOID FURTHER 
EMBARRASSMENT BECAUSE PEOPLE 
STOPPED TO WATCH WHAT WAS GOING ON 
CHRIS WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THAT 
SITUATION HAVE YOU THE RIGHT TO 
SAY NO 
THERE IS NO LAW IN THE U. K. 
TO STOP PEOPLE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS 
IN PUBLIC PLACES JOHN RIGHTLY FELT 
AGGRIEVED THAT HE WAS ASKED TO 
DELETE HIS PICTURES LOTS OF 
AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHERS OUR MAGAZINE 
HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR THE RIGHTS 
OF PHOTOGRAPHERS FOR A NUMBER OF 
YEARS IT'S A SITUATION WHICH HAS 
GOT WORSE IN THE LAST CERTAINLY IN 
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SINCE THE 
TERROR ATTACKS ON LONDON ET CETERA 
IN TERMS OF WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN DOING HE WAS IN HIS RIGHT AND 
HE SHOULD HAVE COMPLAINED HE HAS 
COMPLAINED HE HAS COMPLAINED TO 
HIS M. P. THAT'S WHAT MANY OTHER 
PEOPLE SHOULD DO IN THOSE 
SITUATIONS 
IT SEEMS LIKE THIS SITUATIONS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY SUPPORT 
OFFICER HAD TWO ISSUES ONE THAT HE 
HAD TAKEN JOHN HAD TAKEN 
PHOTOGRAPHS OF A STREET SCENE 
WITHOUT ASKING PERMISSION OF THOSE 
WHO MIGHT BE INVOLVED AND ALSO 
THAT HE HAD TAKEN PHOTOGRAPHS WHICH 
HAD HER IN THEM AND SHE WANTED 
THOSE DELETED IF AS AN INDIVIDUAL 
YOU KNOW SOMEONE HAS TAKEN A 
PHOTOGRAPH OF YOU AND YOU WOULD 
RATHER THEY HADN'T IS IT WITHIN 
YOUR RIGHTS TO SAY I'D RATHER YOU 
DELETED THAT SHOT 
IT'S NOT 
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED YOU CAN GO 
AROUND ANY STREET AND TAKE PICTURES 
AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN A PUBLIC PLACE 
IN THIS SITUATION THE COMMUNITY 
SUPPORT OFFICER WAS IN THE 
BACKGROUND OF THE IMAGE IT WASN'T 
LIKE JOHN WENT UP AND SAID I'M 
TAKING A PICTURE OF YOU AND WHETHER 
YOU LIKE IT OR NOT THE OFFICER 
TOOK UP BRAIPBLG AT THAT IT'S 
TOTALLY UNFAIR HE WASN'T DOING 
ANYTHING ILLEGAL 
STRAIGHTAWAY I'M 
THINKING OF SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE 
MIGHT FEEL JUSTIFIED IN THEM NOT 
TAKING YOUR PICTURE FOR EXAMPLE IF 
YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH 
YOUR KIDS AND SOMEONE TAKES A SNAP 
WHAT'S THE LAW IN THAT CAN YOU 
STOP THEM 
THERE'S NO LAW TO STOP 
YOU TAKING PICTURES IN PUBLIC 
PLACES I THINK THIS THAT SITUATION 
COMMON SENSE SHOULD PREVAIL YOU 
SHOULD GO UP AND SAY IF THERE'S A 
FAMILY DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE YOUR 
PICTURE BUT HE WASN'T DOING 
ANYTHING ILLEGAL HE WAS RIGHT TO 
COMPLAIN THAT'S THE ESSENTIAL 
THING PHOTOGRAPHERS INCREASINGLY 
BOTH PROFESSIONAL AND AMATEUR ARE 
FEELING VICTIMISED BY POLICE THE 
SECOND PROBLEM IS THAT A LOT OF 
OFFICERS DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND 
THE LAW ON PHOTOGRAPHY THEY'RE NOT 
BRIEFED ABOUT THE LAW ON 
PHOTOGRAPHS IN PUBLIC PLACES 
THAT'S A SECOND PROBLEM AS WELL AS 
THE PROBLEM OVER TERRORISM AND 
PAEDOPHILES 
JOHN APART FROM THIS PAEDOPHILES INCIDENT HAVE YOU HAD OTHER 
INCIDENTS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE 
COMPLAINED HAVE YOU NOTICED A 
CHANGE IN ATMOSPHERE 
NO I'VE 
TAKEN MANY PHOTOGRAPHS IN BLACKPOOL 
THIS WAS THE ONLY OCCASION IT 
HAPPENED I HAVE A GALLERY ON THE 
B. B. C. UP IN LANCASHIRE AND I FEEL I'M 
PROMOTING BLACKPOOL IN SOME WAY SO 
IT'S A BIT OF A SHOCK TO BE 
APPROACHED IN THIS WAY AND TOLD TO 
THAT I CAN'T DO IT 
OFFICIALLY HAVE YOU HAD AN APOLOGY 
OR ANYTHING 
NOT AS YET NO 
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IT IT WOULD BE NICE 
I WAS JUST TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS IN A 
PUBLIC PLACE 
DOES IT MAKE YOU MORE 
WARY 
I 
THINK IT DOES YEAH L. L. WARY THINK IT DOES 
IT SHOULDN'T DO 
BECAUSE THERE'S NO LAW AGAINST IT 
IT'S INHIBITING STREET PHOTOGRAPHY 
AS YOU ALLUDED TO EARLIER AUSTIN 
MITCHELL THE M. P. IS A KEEN 
PHOTOGRAPHER AND HE'S CAMPAIGNING 
TO TRY TO PERSUADE THE HOME OFFICE 
TO DRAW UP A SET OF GUIDELINES FOR 
POLICE OFFICERS TO FOLLOW SO 
THEY'RE ALL AWARE ON THE STREET 
EXACTLY WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING ONE IT IS 
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED IF 
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED IF YOU'VE HAD ANY INSTANCES YOURSELF 
WHERE SOMEONE HAS COMPLAINED AND 
YOU HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT LET US 
KNOW

WITH SOME WHITE SAUCE WITH YOUR 
LUNCH YOU CAN PICKLE THE OTHERS

BEAUTIFULLY HAVE THEY BEEN GROWN 
UNDER GLASS 
WELL I MUST CONFESS 
WE DID CHEAT A BIT NOT EVERYBODY 
CAN GET RUNNER BEANS IN FLOWER WITH 
ACTUAL BEANS ON AT THIS TIME OF THE 
YEAR BUT WITH SOME COAXING AND 
SOME PRACTICE WE MANAGED TO GET 
THEM READY ON TIME OR THE TODAY 
THANK YOU KNOW THE JUDGES ARE 
COMING AROUND SO GOOD LUCK WITH 
THAT IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT MORE 
ABOUT HOW TO GROW FRUIT AND 
VEGETABLES YOU CAN COME DOWN TO THE 
FLOWER SHOW IN CARDIFF IT RUNS

RIGHT LENGTH AND TAKE IT IN AT THE 
WAIST SHOES ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO 
GET 
BECAUSE OF COURSE HE IS GET WALKING BUT A CHILD OF HIS SIZE 
WOULD NORMALLY NOT BE WALKING MOST MOST SHOES WOULD FIT HIM WOULD BE PRAM 
SHOES WHICH ARE NOT APPROPRIATE 
HE NEEDS WALKING SHOES IT IS HARD 
TO FIND THEM IT IS A SANE FOR 
EQUIPMENT AROUND THE HOUSE MOST 
THINGS FOR CHILDREN WITH 
DISABILITIES TEND TO BE LARGER THAN 
THE AVERAGE EQUIPMENT HE NEEDS 
EVERYTHING HALF THE SIZE AND WITH 
IT BEING SUCH A RARE CONDITION A 
LOT OF THE STUFF ISN'T THERE WE WE GOT A SENSE SLIGHTLY WHAT IT IS 
LIKE FOR YOU AS A DAD A LOT OF

EXTREMELY HARD FOR ME HE WAS NOT 
BOTHERED HE WENT AWAY AND PLAYED 
WITH THE OTHER KIDS I WAS 
DEVASTATED THERE WERE FEARS OF HIM 
BEING KNOCKED OVER BUT THAT WAS 
NOT THE CASE 
HOW ARE THE OTHER 
KIDS WITH HIM 
ABSOLUTELY FINE 
SOME OF THEM COME TO HIM AND WANT 
TO PICK HIM UP AND NURSE HIM THAT 
IS A GOOD THING FOR THE KIDS THEY 
ARE GOOD CHILDREN BUT HE DOES NOT 
WANT OTHER KIDS PICKING HIM UP 
THAT IS SOMETHING HE IS GOING 
THROUGH HIMSELF HE GETS SCARED OF 
OTHER CHILDREN IF THEY ARE RUNNING 
ABOUT IF THE OTHER CHILD CHANGES 
DIRECTION HE PUTS HIS HANDS UP TO 
DEFEND HIMSELF HE FELL OVER IN 
SCHOOL AND HER TO HIS KNEE BECAUSE 
HE TRIED TO KEEP UP WITH THE OTHER 
KIDS HE GETS EXTREMELY TIRED 
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF CHALLENGES

HOW AMERICA HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH 
HER IT IS VERY LONG WAY FROM THE 
CHIROPODIST SURGERY WHERE SHE USED 
TO WORK LEONA LEWIS IS MAKING POP 
MUSIC HISTORY AMERICANS HAVE BEEN 
BUYING HER DEBUT ALBUM BY THE 
TRUCKLOAD THEY HAVE TAKEN TO THE 
SHY LONDONER 
SHE HAS BEEN AMAZING 
WHEN I SAW HER I DID NOT BELIEVE 
IN HAT AT THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN 
I SAW HER SHE WAS REALLY SOMETHING 
HER

SHE OPENS HER MOUTH AND IT IS 
FANTASTIC SHE IS A GOOD PERSON TO

SOLO ARTIST TO TOP THE SOLO ALBUM 
CHARTS THAT WAS WHEN LEONA LEWIS 
WAS TURNING UP ONE YEAR OLD 
I NEED 
ANOTHER DIVA FOOTSTEP I HAVE GOT IT 
THIS ONLINE CARTOON POKES FUN AT 
CLIVE 
PERFECT BALANCE PERFECT DESERVE 
HER BIG BREAK CAME 
COURTESY OF REALITY TELEVISION AND 
SIMON COWELL THEY THINK THERE IS 
MORE TO HAD THAN A GREAT PRODUCT 
SHE HAS GREAT MARKETING GREAT 
SONGS SHE HAS MACHINE BEHIND HER 
PEOPLE LIKE WHAT THEY LIKE 
THE BIG 
QUESTION IS HOW SHE GOT STAYING 
POWER NASTY NIGEL FROM POP STARS 
IS A BIG WIG ON AMERICA IDOL THE 
BIGGEST TELEVISION TALENT SHOW OF 
THEM ALL 
I WAS WORKING WITH MARIAH 
CAREY AND THE MAN WHO LOOKS AFTER 
HER SAID I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU I 
AM FROM HACKNEY THIS GIRL WHO IS 
NUMBER ONE IS FROM HACKNEY L. NEVER 
THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO SEE A GIRL 
FROM HACKNEY BEAT MIKE MARIAH CAREY 
A MARIAH CAREY LAST WEEK TOOK OVER 
FROM ELVIS IN NUMBER ONE SINGLES 
FOR NOW THE FOCUS IS ON LEONA 
LEWIS I STILL DO NOT LIKE THE SONG 
VERY MUCH SHE HAS AN AMAZING VOICE 
MOVING ON TO AN ISSUE THAT HAS GOT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING STEPHEN 
BADLY NEEDED HELP FOSTER HE WAS 
KNOCKED OFF HIS BIKE IN MANCHESTER 
BY A CAR THAT DID NOT STOP HELP 
SOME MOTORISTS DROVE AROUND HIS 
BODY POLICE THINK ONE PERSON 
ACTUALLY DROVE OVER HIS LEGS HE 
DID NOT SURVIVE THE HEAD INJURIES 
HE SUFFERED 
I JUST WISH I 
INHERITED A ROUGH NEIGHBOURHOOD AND 
PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT STOPPING THEIR 
CARS AT THE END OF THE DAY JUST A 
NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE CALL OR PLUCKING A LANE TO 
PREVENT OTHER CARS RUNNING OVER HIM 
IT COULD HAVE HELPED HIM TO BE 
ALIVE TODAY 
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN 
GOOD MORNING BEFRIEND THEIR SAID 
IT WAS A ROUGH NEIGHBOURHOOD IT 
WAS EARLY IN THE MORNING WHY DO 
PEOPLE NOT STOP 
WE DO HAVE AN 
EXAGGERATED SENSE OF DANGER IF YOU 
LOOK AT HOME OFFICE STATISTICS 
VIOLENT CRIME HAS DECREASED BY FORTY PER CENT 
AT THE SAME TIME SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF US 
BELIEVE VIOLENT CRIME HAS GONE UP 
IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE REALITY 
PEOPLE ARE SCARED THAT IF THEY STOP 
THEY WILL BECOME THE VICTIM OF A 
CRIME EITHER BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE A 
HOAX OR SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO 
THEM AS A RESULT 
I THINK 
THEREFORE IT IS EASY TO KEEP 
MOVING I DO NOT THINK ANYONE WOULD 
SAY I AM GOING TO IGNORE THIS MAN 
THAT IS DYING IT IS MORE AN 
IMPULSIVE THING IT IS A DESERTED 
PLACE AND I AM WORRIED ABOUT MY OWN 
SENSE OF DANGER THE MORE PEOPLE 
BELIEVE IT IS DANGEROUS THE MORE 
IT BECOMES DANGEROUS IF PEOPLE DO 
NOT GO OUT IN THE STREETS AT NIGHT 
THE STREETS BECOME DESERTED AND 
THERE IS MORE LIKELY TO BE CRIME A A MAN IS DEAD AND PEOPLE DID NOT HELP 
DO YOU THINK THIS HOUSE US 
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW WE ARE 
GENERALLY DO YOU SENSE THAT IN 
YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE DO YOU FEEL YOU 
ARE LESS KEEN TO SAY SOMETHING TO 
CHECK THAT SOMEONE IS O. K. 
I THINK 
THIS IS A MEDIA BRANT THE DAILY 
MAIL LOVES STORIES THAT SAYS 
MORALLY WE ARE ALL GOING TO HELL 
WE ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE 
DEGENERATE THIS WAS THREE THIRTY AM ON A 
DUAL CARRIAGEWAY WE DO NOT KNOW 
WHAT IS IN THE MINDS OF THE DRIVERS 
AS THEY WENT PAST MAYBE THEY HAD 
DRUNK TOO MUCH THEMSELVES YOU DO 
NOT KNOW WHAT THEY THINK THEY SAW 
IT IS EASY TO JUMP TO THE 
CONCLUSION THAT WE ARE ALL THAT 
SAMARITANS I THINK IT IS DIFFERENT 
DIFFICULT WE ALL LIVE IN OUR OWN 
BUBBLE IN AN URBAN WORLD WE HAVE 
OUR OWN FRIENDS AND CONNECTIONS L. 
HAVE COME ACROSS SO MANY INCIDENTS 
WHEN PEOPLE DO STOP AND HELP AND 
ASK PEOPLE IF THEY NEED HELP AS 
WELL I THINK WE ARE A MIXTURE OF 
GOOD AND BAD 
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
MAKING THIS SAME POINT THAT THERE 
HAS BEEN A CHANGE IN THE CULTURE 
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF BEING SUED AND 
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID THAT THEY ARE 
GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN SOME SORT 
OF CRIMINAL SITUATION MARK FROM 
REDDITCH SAYS I WOULD NOT STOP TO 
HELP ANYONE L. AM FIRST AID TRAINED 
AND WOULD NOT HAVE ANY MEMBER OF 
THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR FEAR 
SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME IF 
SOMETHING WENT WRONG THAT SEEMS TO 
SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE 
PERFECT POSITION ARE AFRAID TO DO 
IT 
THIS IS A VERY EXTREME IT SITUATION THERE ARE DAY TO DAY 
SITUATIONS WHERE WE CAN HELP PEOPLE 
WHERE THERE IS NOT THAT AMBIGUITY 
STOPPING AT A TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND 
SMILING GIVES EIGHT FIRE WILL 
EFFECT WAS THAT THE MORE WE CAN 
CONNECT WITH PEOPLE THE MORE WE 
CAN CREATE A SENSE OF BELONGING AS 
A COMMUNITY THIS ACT OF RANDOM 
KINDNESS IS AN IDEA 
EVERYONE LOVES 
THE THOUGHT OF THAT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE CAUTIOUS ABOUT GETTING 
INVOLVED 
IN OTHER 
PEOPLE'S LIVES 
FOR FEAR OF A REACTION OF 
I THINK 
THAT IS AN EXTREME CASE REACTION 
YOU FIND LOTS OF PEOPLE WILLING TO 
UP OR INTERVENE WHEN THEY SEE 
TROUBLE THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE AND 
LESS GOOD PEOPLE THERE ARE 
COMMUNITY MINDED PEOPLE AND LESS 
COMMUNITY MINDED PEOPLE THE IDEA 
THAT WE ARE GETTING WORSE AND IT IS 
GETTING DANGEROUS ACTUALLY IT IS 
GETTING SAFER WE HAVE VERY LITTLE 
SOCIAL MEMORY ABOUT HOW THINGS USED 
TO BE WE'RE ALL BORN WITH AN 
INBRED SENSE THAT PEOPLE WHEN NICER

NEWSPAPERS NEWSPAPERS THE LADY WHO SET UP THE WEBSITE IS 
HERE TO EXPLAIN 
HAS EVERYBODY GOT A STORY TO SELL

ILLUSTRATE DAY TO DAY LIFE THE 
TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS PEOPLE GO

YOU CAN SAY I DON'T THINK YOU CAN 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE NICE THINGS 
THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM SO I 
SAY LET'S APPROACH THIS MAGAZINE 
WHAT ABOUT THIS PAPER WE 
INTERVIEWED THEM AND WRITE THE 
STORIES AND HOLD THEIR HAND 
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PROCESS 
ALISON MANY PEOPLE THINK THEY HAVE 
A BOOK IN THEM DO YOU THINK 
GENUINELY PEOPLE HAVE INTERESTING 
STORIES THAT ARE WORTH TELLING TO 
THE NEWSPAPERS AND EARNING MONEY 
YOU NEED TO LEARN ABOUT THE LONG 
TERM CONSEQUENCES THIS COULD HAVE 
A DESTABILISING EFFECT ON LOTS OF 
RELATIONSHIPS PRINCESS DIANA

TO YOU IN YOUR TWENTIES BUT IT WILL 
STILL BE IN THE CUTTINGS TEN YEARS 
LATER WHEN YOU ARE IN A DIFFERENT 
RELATIONSHIP WHEN YOU ARE EIGHTEEN YOU 
MIGHT DECIDE TO HAVE A TATTOO BUT

SAME APPEAL

I WANT TO HOLD TWO HUNDRED WILL 
THROW IN TWENTY FIVE CENT TIP FOR THE 
MESSENGER BOY IN THE MEANTIME WE 
ARE NOT OPEN YET AND THAT MEANS YOU 
ARE ALL TRESPASSING 
DANNY GLOVER IS WITH US NOW THE 
FILM IS ALL ABOUT MUSIC AND IT IS 
BASED AROUND THE STORY OF THE 
BEGINNING OF ROCK'N'ROLL ISN'T IT 
IT IS THAT IS WHAT IS SO WONDERFUL 
ABOUT JOHN SALES IN HIS WRITING 
HE IMPARTS SOMETHING DEEPER THAN 
JUST THE MUSIC ITSELF THE MUSIC 
BECOMES A METAPHOR FOR THE CHANGE 
THAT IS HAPPENING BY VIRTUE OF 
TECHNOLOGY THE IDEA YOU HAVE A 
YOUNG KID WHO IS IN THE NAVY DURING 
WORLD WAR TWO AND LEARNS ABOUT 
RADIOS NOW HE IS A MUSICIAN AND A 
LECTURE FIRES HIS GUITAR IT IS A 
MUCH LARGER STORY ABOUT THE 
TECHNOLOGY AND THE RELATIONSHIP 
THAT THESE COMMUNITIES AFRICAN 
AMERICAN COLOUREDS HAVE WITH THE 
CHANGE THAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN 
THE COUNTRY ITSELF BLUES IS A 
PRE CURSOR TO THE MUSIC THAT WE 
HEAR TODAY BLUES ROCK AND ROLL IS 
A PRECURSOR TO THAT MUSIC 
IT IS A 
VERY RICH FILM BECAUSE IT IS FULL 
OF MUSIC YOU PLAYED A BAR OWNER 
WHO HAS JUST REFUSED TO HAVE GUITAR 
MUSIC IN THE BAR 
PART OF IT IS 
THE PIANO IS THE DOMINANT 
INSTRUMENT AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME 
BUT THE PIANO IS STATIONERY AND YOU 
CANNOT MOVE THE PIANO YOU HAVE TO 
BE BEHIND THE PIANO A GUITAR 
PLAYER PARTICULARLY ELECTRIC 
GUITAR PLAYER MOVES FROM ONE PLACE 
HIS MOBILE IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF 
WAY YOU HAVE THIS IDEA OF MOBILITY 
INTRODUCED TO THE MUSIC AS WELL WE WE WERE JUST WATCHING THIS CLIP AND IT 
APPEARS TO BE YOU PLAYING THE PIANO 
DID YOU PLAY IN THE FILM 
I HAD 
NEVER PLAYED THE PIANO BEFORE IN 
MY MIND I ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY AN 
INSTRUMENT BUT FOR SOME REASON I 
NEVER GOT THAT OPPORTUNITY YOU YOU CANAL KNOCKOUT A TUNE CAN YOU 
I DO 
BETTER IN THE SHOWER 
YOU LEARN 
SOME PIANO FOR THE MOVIE BUT THE 
INTRICATE PIANO STUFF IS DONE BY 
SOMEONE ELSE 
THERE ARE CERTAIN 
THINGS I CAN PLAY ON THE PIANO 
BASIC STUFF BUT THE INTRICATE 
PIANO PLAYING IS SOMEONE ELSE IT 
IS A HAND STUBBLE 
I HAVE TO ASK 
YOU GORDON BROWN HAS JUST BEEN IN 
WASHINGTON MEETING THE WOULD BE 
PRESIDENTS INCLUDING BARACK OBAMA 
HAND DOUBLE DO YOU SEE THIS AS 
THE ENDGAME OF PART OF WHAT THIS 
FILM WAS TALKING ABOUT BLACK 
RIGHTS IN AMERICA AND HOW THINGS 
HAVE CHANGED A BLACK AMERICAN 
PRESIDENT 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS PRESIDENT REFLECTIVE OF WHAT HAS CHANGED 
SOME ASPECT OF AMERICAN POLITICAL 
LIFE HAS CHANGED AS PEOPLE BECOME 
MORE PART OF THE BODY POLITICS AND 
WHAT HAPPENS POLITICALLY WE CAN 
TALK ABOUT CHANGE BUT WE HAVE TO 
KIND OF CAUTION AND BE VERY 
CAUTIOUS WHEN WE THINK OF A BLACK 
PRESIDENT OF A REAL REFLECTION OF 
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE AFRICAN 
AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ALL 
COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES 
THIS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AFFECTS THE 
COLOURED WARP COLOURED MORE BUT 
IT AFFECTS ALL AMERICANS IT IS A 
SYMPTOM OF THE POLICIES OVER THE 
LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS OR MORE IT IS A 
POLICY THAT WAS BROUGHT FROM THE 
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WE CAN GET 
EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT BUT A CAMPAIGN 
IS NOT A MOVEMENT AND I THINK 
PEOPLE NEED A MOVEMENT FOR CHANGE 
HOW WE REFLECT ON HOW WE LOOK AT 
CHANGE HASTIE SITUATED IN THE REAL 
DYNAMIC WHAT I THINK THE QUALITY 
OF CHANGE THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH 
IN TERMS OF OUR COUNTRY AND THE 
WORLD WE LIVE IN 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
AS A DASH OF BARACK OBAMA AS AN 
INDIVIDUAL 
HE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY INDIVIDUAL MAN HE IS VERY COWS MUST 
CHARISMATIC WHAT HAPPENS IS WE 
OFTEN THINK MEN ARE WOMEN MAKE 
HISTORY BUT HISTORY MAKES THEM 
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING HISTORY 
ITSELF MAKES WHO WE ARE WE DO NOT 
MAKE FOR HISTORY AS THEY SAID WE 
HAVE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS AT THIS 
TIME ON WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE 
WORLD WHEN I WAS BORN MORE THAN SIXTY 
YEARS AGO THERE WERE TWO FIVE 
BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND 
NOW ACCORDING TO ESTIMATIONS THERE 
ARE TWENTY FIVE BILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON 
LESS THAN TWO DOLLARS A DAY THAT IS VERY 
FRIGHTENING 
I KNOW YOU HAVE DONE A FRIGHTENING LOT OF WORK ON ALL SORTS OF ISSUES 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE OUT OF 
TIME TIME HAVE A GOOD DAY COULD BUY 
GOODBYE 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER
