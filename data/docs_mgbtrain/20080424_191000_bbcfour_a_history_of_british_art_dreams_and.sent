THIS EXQUISITE WORK OF ART ALWAYS SEEMS A BIT LONELY TO ME 
HERE IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY 
IT'S THE ONLY BRITISH PAINTING IN THE RENAISSANCE WING 
A REMINDER OF ALL THAT NEVER TOOK PLACE IN BRITISH ART 
THE WILTON DIPTYCH WAS PAINTED FOR RICHARD THE SECOND IN THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETIES 
IT STANDS ALONE AMONG THE GREAT SIENNESE AND FLORENTINE PAINTINGS 
OF THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES 
THERE WOULD BE NO BRITISH RAPHAEL NO MICHELANGELO 
NO CARAVAGGIO NO VELAZQUEZ 
I LOOK AT THIS PICTURE AND SEE THAT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN EQUIVALENTS 
TO THOSE ARTISTS IN THIS COUNTRY 
BUT THE BRITISH TURNED THEIR BACK ON SUCH SACRED BEAUTY 
AND SO TURNED AWAY FROM THE GREAT TRADITIONS OF EUROPEAN RELIGIOUS ART 
WE FOLLOWED OUR OWN IDIOSYNCRATIC COURSE 
AND CREATED ANOTHER KIND OF BEAUTY 
OUR TRIUMPHS IN ART WOULD BE DISTINCTIVELY OUR OWN 
THE STORY OF ART IN BRITAIN AMOUNTS TO AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF THE NATION 
BUT LIKE ALL AUTOBIOGRAPHIES IT ISN'T ENTIRELY TRUSTWORTHY 
IT'S THE DEVIOUS WORK OF A SPLIT PERSONALITY 
SOME PAGES HAVE BEEN LOST TORN OUT OR BURNED 
WHOLE CHAPTERS HAVE BEEN MADE TO DISAPPEAR 
THE TRACES STILL REMAIN 
IF YOU LOOK IN THE RIGHT PLACES 
STORIES FULL OF GAPS CAN BE THE MOST REVEALING 
NOTHING SAYS MORE ABOUT BRITISH CULTURE THAN THE HOLES IN ITS PAST 
CENSORSHIP IS AT THE CENTRE OF THE HISTORY OF ART IN BRITAIN THIS STORY STARTS WITH AN ENDING 
THE VIOLENT DESTRUCTION OF TRADITIONS OF PAINTING AND SCULPTURE WHICH HAD FLOURISHED FOR CENTURIES 
THIS IS THE LADY CHAPEL IN ELY CATHEDRAL 
TWO HUNDRED YEARS AFTER IT HAD BEEN LOVINGLY CARVED BY MASONS AND SCULPTORS 
ANOTHER GROUP OF MEN WITH HAMMERS AND CHISELS CAME IN AND SMASHED IT UP 
THE WALLS ARE FORLORN WITH HEADLESS BODIES 
AND STONE TORSOS WITH MISSING ARMS AND LEGS 
BUT FAR MORE OF THE DESTRUCTION IS NOW INVISIBLE 
ALL THE FREESTANDING STATUES WERE PULLED DOWN WE'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE 
THE BRITISH MIDDLE AGES HAVE BECOME THE MISSING AGES 
THIS VIOLENCE WASN'T MINDLESS 
THE BREAKING OF IMAGES OR ICONOCLASM 
HAD A LOGIC AND A STARTING POINT 
IT BEGAN WITH THE DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERIES BY HENRY THE EIGHTH 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR HENRY DECLARED HIMSELF THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND 
AND BROKE WITH THE AUTHORITY OF THE POPE 
BRITAIN BECAME AN ISLAND EMOTIONALLY AND GEOGRAPHICALLY 
IT WAS NO LONGER PART OF A PAN EUROPEAN CATHOLIC CULTURE 
STRETCHING FROM DUNFERMLINE TO BEIRUT 
THIS VIOLENT REFORMING OF THE OLD CATHOLIC FAITH 
CONTINUED UNDER HENRY'S SON EDWARD THE SIXTH AND HIS DAUGHTER ELIZABETH I 
ICONOCLASM WAS THE OFFICIAL POLICY OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND 
LED BY ITS RADICAL HIERARCHY 
MEN LIKE ARCHBISHOP CRANMER AND BISHOPS LATIMER AND RIDLEY 
A VIOLENT HATRED OF RELIGIOUS ART SWEPT THROUGH BRITAIN IN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES 
THE PROCESS OF DESTRUCTION HAS BEEN CALLED THE REFORMATION A TAME WORD FOR WHAT HAPPENED 
THIS WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A CULTURAL REVOLUTION 
THE VIOLENCE OF THAT REVOLUTION HAS ECHOED RIGHT THROUGH OUR HISTORY 
WE'RE STILL LIVING WITH THE AFTERSHOCK 
WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH ART 
HATE TRIUMPHED HERE 
BISHOP WEST'S CHANTRY WAS COMPLETED IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY 
SHORTLY BEFORE THE START OF THE REFORMATION 
SO THE MEN WHO CARVED THESE STATUES LIVED TO SEE THEIR WORK DESTROYED 
THE RELIGIOUS ARENA WAS NOW OUT OF BOUNDS TO ARTISTS 
AT A TIME WHEN MOST ART WAS RELIGIOUS ART 
THIS WAS TANTAMOUNT TO OUTLAWING ART ITSELF 
THESE SCARRED WALLS COULD HAVE BEEN MADE GOOD 
BUT THE TRACES OF CARVINGS HAVE BEEN DELIBERATELY LEFT IN PLACE 
ABSTRACTS OF THE HUMAN FIGURE HACKED ALMOST FLAT TO THE WALL 
THE MEN WITH HAMMERS INSISTED THESE MUTILATED FIGURES REMAIN FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE 
LIKE CORPSES EXHIBITED AFTER AN EXECUTION 
OVER A CENTURY LATER THE ICONOCLASTS WERE STILL AT WORK 
THE IMAGES IN THESE WINDOWS IN WELLS CATHEDRAL WERE SMASHED REMAINING ONLY AS JUMBLED FRAGMENTS 
RATHER LIKE A KANDINSKY OR CUBIST CANVAS IN GLASS 
THEY WERE ATTACKED BY CROMWELL'S ARMY IN THE CIVIL WAR IN THE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTIES 
IT'S COMMONLY HELD THAT CROMWELL AND HIS SOLDIERS DID MOST OF THE DAMAGE TO THE CATHEDRALS 
BUT THEY WERE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE END OF REFORMATION DESTRUCTION 
THEY WERE MERELY FINISHING OFF THE WORK OF THE CHURCH 
THE ANGLICAN ESTABLISHMENT AS IF EMBARRASSED BY THE DEEDS CARRIED OUT IN ITS NAME 
ATTEMPTED TO LAY THE BLAME ON CROMWELL AND PURITAN EXTREMISM 
THIS MUCH HAS PASSED INTO FOLKLORE 
I CAME ACROSS AN ABBEY THAT WAS CRUMBLED ALL TO BITS 
IT LOOKED A RELIC OF A BYGONE DAY 
A GENTLEMAN SAID WHAT IS THIS I SAID EXCUSE ME SIR 
I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT IF I MAY 
IT'S A BIT OF A RUIN THAT CROMWELL KNOCKED ABOUT A BIT 
ONE THAT OLIVER CROMWELL KNOCKED ABOUT A BIT 
IN THE GAY OLD DAYS THERE USED TO BE SOME DOINGS 
NO WONDER THAT THE POOR OLD ABBEY WENT TO RUINS 
THOSE WHO'VE STUDIED HISTORY SING AND SHOUT OF IT 
BY CROMWELL'S TIME 
AFTER OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF ICONOCLASM THE HAMMERING HAD BEEN HEARD 
NOT JUST IN THE CATHEDRALS BUT IN EVERY PARISH CHURCH 
IT'S IRONIC THAT THE COUNTRY CHURCH SHOULD HAVE BECOME A REASSURING SYMBOL OF CONTINUITY IN BRITAIN 
FEW PLACES HAVE SEEN AS MUCH VIOLENT CHANGE AS OUR CHURCHES 
CHURCHES ARE THE BATTLEFIELDS 
ON WHICH A WAR FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION WAS FOUGHT 
CHURCHES PROVIDE THE KEY TO THE STORY OF BRITISH ART 
WE'RE OFTEN SAID TO BE A LITERARY RATHER THAN A VISUAL PEOPLE 
BUT THE ART SURVIVING FROM THESE BUILDINGS BATTERED AND FRAGMENTED 
PROVES THAT BRITAIN WAS ONCE A PROFOUNDLY VISUAL CULTURE 
TOO CRUDE TO BE A MASTERPIECE BUT STILL UNFORGETTABLE 
THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW SURVIVING MEDIEVAL PAINTINGS OF THE LAST JUDGEMENT 
THE WENHASTON DOOM AT WENHASTON IN SUFFOLK 
THE PICTURE MAKES NO CONCESSIONS TO ARTISTRY 
IT WAS PAINTED ON BOARDS 
AND WOULD HAVE PROVIDED THE BACKDROP TO CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION 
YOU CAN SEE THE OUTLINE OF WHERE THE CROSS WOULD HAVE BEEN 
THE MESSAGE OF THE DOOM IS STRAIGHTFORWARD 
THOU SHALT BE AFRAID 
I WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED TOO 
HELL IS A FISH 
RAPACIOUSLY CONSUMING THE DAMNED 
THE HORRORS STAY WITH YOU A DEMONIC IMPRINT ON THE IMAGINATION 
THE SPECTATOR DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND PLEASURE IN SUCH A PICTURE 
IN FACT THEY WERE NOT A SPECTATOR AT ALL IN THE MODERN SENSE 
ART THEN WASN'T ART AS WE UNDERSTAND IT NOW 
ART WAS AN IMPORTANT FORM OF INSTRUCTION IN A SOCIETY WHERE FEW KNEW HOW TO READ 
ART WAS AN AID TO PRAYER AND TO MEDITATION 
A WAY OF HELPING PEOPLE TO IMAGINE HEAVEN AND HELL TO FIND SALVATION 
THROUGH FAITH AND GOOD WORKS 
ART WAS LIKE A SIGNPOST TO THE NEXT WORLD PLACED IN THIS ONE 
IN ITS OWN DIRECT WAY THE DOOM BRINGS CHRISTIAN BELIEF ALIVE 
TOO ALIVE FOR THE REFORMERS WHO SAW IT AS SUPERSTITIOUS PROPAGANDA 
PAPAL TRASH IN THEIR OWN PHRASE 
THEY WHITEWASHED OVER IT IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY NINE 
IT WAS FORGOTTEN FOR THREE HUNDRED YEARS AND EVENTUALLY TAKEN INTO THE GRAVEYARD 
AS JUNK TO BE BURNED 
IT SURVIVES THANKS TO A SUDDEN RAINFALL ONE DAY IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
WHICH WASHED OFF THE WHITE PAINT REVEALING AGAIN HEAVEN AND HELL 
AND SAINT MICHAEL WEIGHING UP WHO WOULD BE DAMNED AND WHO WOULD BE SAVED 
THE DEPTH AND INTIMACY OF THE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THE BRITISH AND THE IMAGES IN THEIR LIVES CAN BE SEEN IN THE ANTIPHONA 
BELONGING TO SAINT HELEN'S RANWORTH A FIFTEENTH CENTURY CHURCH IN A WOOL TOWN IN NORFOLK 
THE TINY PAINTINGS IN THIS BEAUTIFUL ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPT 
BRILLIANTLY INTERWEAVE FAITH AND IMAGINATION 
THEY DEPICT THE GREATEST MYSTERIES OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH 
AS EVENTS WHICH COULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE ANYWHERE 
IN THE MINIATURE DEVOTED TO THE ASCENSION 
WE SEE CHRIST RISING TO HEAVEN FROM A HILL 
ONLY HIS FEET ARE VISIBLE AND HIS FOOTPRINTS ARE LEFT ON THE GRASS 
IN THE SAME BOOK WE FIND JONAH BEING DISGORGED BY WHAT LOOKS LIKE A SHARK 
OR PERHAPS A VERY LARGE PIKE ON THE NORFOLK BROADS 
WHICH CAN BE SEEN FROM THE CHURCH TOWER 
SUCH HOMELY DEPICTIONS OF THE MIRACULOUS EXISTED TO PERSUADE 
YES THEY SAY THESE MIRACLES REALLY HAPPENED 
AND TO PEOPLE AS REAL AS YOU IN PLACES AS REAL AS HERE 
THE CHURCH CONTAINS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SURVIVING EXAMPLES OF THE CARVED AND PAINTED SCREEN 
THIS ROOD SCREEN WAS ONCE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CATHOLIC FAITH IN BRITAIN 
THE SCREEN'S FUNCTION WAS PARTLY THEATRICAL 
IT SEPARATED THE CONGREGATION FROM THE ALTAR 
ENHANCING THE SENSE OF MYSTERY AND DRAMA ASSOCIATED WITH THE MASS 
THE ROOD SCREEN WAS TRADITIONALLY THE MOST RICHLY DECORATED PART OF THE CHURCH 
LOCAL VARIATIONS IN BRITISH MEDIEVAL ART ARE HUGE 
THIS WORK IS MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THE WENHASTON DOOM PAINTING 
THE FIGURES ARE PAINTED IN RICHER COLOURS GOLDS GREENS BLUES 
GROUND UP FROM SEMIPRECIOUS STONES 
THEY ARE ALSO DRAWN MORE ELEGANTLY 
BY AN ARTIST WITH A SOPHISTICATED SENSE OF DESIGN AND COLOUR 
THE RICHNESS OF THE FABRIC MAY REPRESENT A CERTAIN LOCAL PRIDE 
SUBTLY SUGGESTING THE TALENTS OF MANUFACTURERS OF THE REAL TEXTILES IN EAST ANGLIA 
ARTISTS OF THE TIME DID NOT SIGN THEIR WORK 
ART WASN'T THOUGHT OF AS SELF EXPRESSION BUT AS THE EXPRESSION OF GOD'S PURPOSES 
THE ROOD IN ROOD SCREEN MEANS CROSS 
ON TOP OF THE SCREEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT IMAGE 
A FOCUS OF THE WHOLE CHURCH 
A LARGER THAN LIFE SIZE STATUE OF THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST 
THE TOP OF THE SCREEN WOULD HAVE BEEN LIT WITH CANDLES 
AND ACCESSED BY THE STAIRS 
THEY'RE REDUNDANT NOW BECAUSE THERE'S NO CRUCIFIX HERE ANY MORE 
NOT ONE COMPLETE CHRIST HAS SURVIVED ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY 
BUT THERE IS A CLUE TO WHAT THEY MIGHT ONCE HAVE BEEN LIKE 
IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT ANDREW IN CULLOMPTON A SMALL TOWN IN DEVON 
IT CONTAINS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY OBJECTS I'VE EVER SEEN 
THERE'S A HINT OF WHAT'S TO COME ON THE OUTSIDE 
THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW REMAINS OF THE GREAT CARVED CHRISTS 
IT'S THE BASE OF A SCULPTURE OF THE CRUCIFIXION REPRESENTING THE LAND AT THE FOOT OF THE CROSS 
THE SKULL LITTERED GROUND OF GOLGOTHA 
IT'S PRIMITIVE LOOKING BUT THAT'S ITS POWER 
IT EVOKES THE MOST TIMELESS HUMAN EMOTION THE TERROR OF DEATH 
THESE DEATH'S HEADS IN A DESERT LAND SCULPTED SIMPLY WITH A CHISEL 
HAVE A POWER AND SIMPLICITY NEVER SEEN AGAIN IN BRITISH SCULPTURE 
THEY'RE STARK AND ASTONISHING 
IT'S ENGLISH ART BUT LITTLE JUSTICE THE WORD ENGLISH SEEMS TO DO IT 
IT'S LIKE A TOTEM OR A FETISH OBJECT 
A SAVAGE THING NOT ENGLISH AT ALL AS WE USE THE WORD NOW 
BUT MORE LIKE AZTEC OR TOLTEC 
IT'S A LOST TRIBAL MEMORY OF WHAT WE MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN LIKE 
OF THE KINDS OF SUPERSTITIOUS FEARS AND PASSIONS WE MUST HAVE FELT ONCE 
REMEMBER TOO THAT THIS IS ONLY A PART OF WHAT IT ONCE WAS 
A STATUE OF CHRIST WOULD HAVE BEEN SLOTTED INTO THIS HOLE 
WITH MARY AND JOHN EITHER SIDE 
THE WHOLE THING WOULD HAVE BEEN PLACED UP ON THE ROOD SCREEN 
WHAT MUST IT HAVE LOOKED LIKE IN CONTEXT TOWERING ABOVE THE CONGREGATION 
NOW LITTLE MORE THAN A CURIOSITY AT THE BACK OF THE CHURCH 
IT'S FALLEN INTO THE BLACK HOLE OF AMNESIA AND IGNORANCE 
SHARED BY SO MUCH BRITISH MEDIEVAL ART 
HIDDEN AWAY IN THE CITY OF LONDON 
ONE ALMOST INTACT STONE FIGURE OF CHRIST DOES SURVIVE 
IT WAS FOUND UNDERNEATH THE MERCERS' HALL IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES BY WORKMEN 
IT'S NOT CHRIST ON THE CROSS BUT IN THE TOMB 
IT'S NEVER BEEN SEEN BY THE PUBLIC 
CREATED IN THE EARLY SIXTEENTH CENTURY SO NEARLY THE BRITISH RENAISSANCE 
ITS REALISM IS MESMERISING 
THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS IN THE LEGS 
HAVE BEEN SPASMED BY THE CRAMPS AND AGONIES OF CRUCIFIXION 
HE HAS JUST BREATHED HIS LAST 
THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD HAS GONE OUT 
BEFORE THE MIRACLE OF THE RESURRECTION 
WHEN I LOOK AT IT LYING ON THE BOARDROOM FLOOR OF THE MERCERS' HALL 
I SEE TWO DEATHS THAT OF CHRIST IN HIS AGONY 
AND THAT OF A TRADITION OF CARVING IN THIS COUNTRY 
IN SAINT MARY'S PRIORY CHURCH ABERGAVENNY 
ONE OTHER GREAT FIGURATIVE SCULPTURE HAS SURVIVED FROM THE PRE REFORMATION PAST 
IT IS VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN 
IT'S NEVER BEEN FILMED BEFORE AND AS FAR AS I KNOW NOTHING HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT IT 
IT'S A FIGURE OF JESSE FATHER OF DAVID ANCESTOR OF JESUS CHRIST 
IT WAS CARVED FROM AN OAK TREE 
SOME TIME BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY AND ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TEN 
JESSE IN THE THEOLOGY OF MEDIEVAL CATHOLICISM 
IS THE ROOT FROM WHICH CHRIST GROWS 
THE STUMP PROJECTING FROM THE GROIN 
WAS ONCE A BASE FOR OTHER CARVINGS 
TWISTING UP THE WALL TO BECOME A CARVING OF CHRIST'S LIFE DEATH AND RESURRECTION 
THESE COLLECTIVE OBJECTS WERE CALLED JESSE TREES 
THIS ISN'T JUST THE MOST IMPRESSIVE WOODEN FIGURE 
TO SURVIVE THE REFORMATION BONFIRES IN WALES 
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST SCULPTURES OF THE WORLD 
IT'S GOT THE POWER AND SPIRITUALITY OF ITALIAN QUATTROCENTO PAINTING 
BUT TRANSLATED INTO WEIGHTY SCULPTURAL FORM 
TRACES OF PAINT INDICATE HOW EXOTIC HE MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN 
THERE'S SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND OCCULT ABOUT THIS EASTERN PROPHET 
PERHAPS THERE'S STILL AN ECHO IN THIS FIGURE OF OAK 
OF THE ANCIENT PAGAN TREE CULTS ONCE SO STRONG IN THIS PART OF WALES 
IF NOT FOR THE REFORMATION WE MIGHT HAVE A STANDARD TERM FOR SUCH WORK 
EARLY WELSH RENAISSANCE PERHAPS 
BUT THERE ARE NO FRAMES OF REFERENCE FOR SUCH A WORK 
EVERYTHING LIKE IT WAS DESTROYED IT IS WITHOUT A HISTORY 
A WONDERFUL ODDITY 
THIS IS ALL THAT IS LEFT OF A GREAT STONE FIGURE OF JESSE 
HERE IN SAINT CUTHBERT'S WELLS IT'S THE REVERSE JESSE DOESN'T SURVIVE 
BUT THE REST OF THE TREE THE FIGURES WHICH ONCE GREW OUT OF HIS SIDE DO 
THEY ARE NOT IN TERRIBLY GOOD SHAPE 
HAVING BEEN HACKED TO PIECES BY THE REFORMERS IN THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTIES 
THE FRAGMENTS WERE SWEPT UP BY A SYMPATHISER 
IN THE HOPE THAT ONE DAY THE JIGSAW OF THEIR ORIGINAL BEAUTY 
WOULD BE PUT BACK TOGETHER AND THE STATUES DISPLAYED AGAIN 
THEY'RE STILL WAITING 
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU MIGHT THINK THESE SCULPTURES 
WITH THEIR MARVELLOUSLY PRESERVED PAINT 
WERE FRAGMENTS FROM SOME ANCIENT GREEK TEMPLE 
BECAUSE SO LITTLE SURVIVES AND WHAT DOES IS SO VARIOUS FROM AZTEC TO HELLENISTIC 
IT'S HARD TO DEFINE THE ESSENCE OF BRITISH MEDIEVAL ART 
BUT THERE IS ONE STRAIN RUNNING THROUGHOUT 
AND THERE'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF IT ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS CHURCH 
GRINNING GARGOYLES AND DEFORMED WEIRD CREATURES 
MIGHT BE MARGINAL TO THEOLOGICAL DOCTRINE 
BUT THEY WERE A CONSTANT PRESENCE IN CHURCH ART 
THE BRITISH WERE NOTED FOR SUCH IMAGES 
AND INFLUENCED THE REST OF EUROPE 
THERE'S A WORD FOR THIS CARNIVALESQUE ART FORM BABOONERY 
A SPIRIT OF BABOONERY RUNS RIGHT THROUGH BRITISH CULTURE AN ANARCHY IN OUR IMAGINATION 
THE IRREPRESSIBLE CHARACTERS OF CHAUCER ARE LITERARY EXAMPLES 
BUT THIS DANGEROUS ASPECT OF THE BRITISH MIND IS MOST VISIBLE IN ART 
IT'S THERE IN HOGARTH'S GROTESQUES 
IN THE STRANGE MUTANTS IN THE WORK OF JAMES GILLRAY 
AND IN THE DISTORTED HEADS OF FRANCIS BACON 
THIS POWERFUL STRAIN OF EXCESS OF GROTESQUERY HAS ITS ORIGINS IN BRITISH MEDIEVAL ART 
SUCH SPIRITED IMAGINATION WAS REFLECTED 
IN THE VIGOUR OF THE BACKLASH AGAINST IT 
THE DESTRUCTION OF WORKS OF ART 
WAS ITSELF DONE WITH THE SAME KIND OF EXCESS AS THE BABOONERY 
THE FORERUNNERS OF ENGLISH PROTESTANTISM THE LOLLARDS 
HAD BEEN KNOWN TO SINGE BEARDS ONTO IMAGES OF THE VIRGIN MARY 
SUBVERSIVE GESTURES AGAINST ART 
WHICH PREDICT TWENTIETH CENTURY ACTS OF IRREVERENCE 
LIKE MARCEL DUCHAMP DRAWING A MOUSTACHE ONTO THE MONA LISA 
THE MEDIEVAL VISION WAS AT ITS MOST STUNNING AND UNCONSTRAINED IN THE CATHEDRALS 
THE GREAT SET PIECES OF THE CATHOLIC FAITH 
THE CATHEDRAL WAS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT 
THE CLOSEST THING ON EARTH TO A VISION OF HEAVEN ITSELF 
THE CATHEDRALS WERE MADE TO BE VISIBLE FOR MILES 
GREAT SHIPS OF SALVATION 
WITH THEIR TOWERS AND SPIRES RISING UP INTO THE SKY LIKE MASTS 
WE ADMIRE THESE BUILDINGS NOW FOR THEIR DARING AND INGENUITY 
BUT YOU MISS THE POINT WHEN YOU SEE THEM IN PURELY STRUCTURAL TERMS 
TODAY THESE STATUES ARE BLEACHED GHOSTS OF THEIR FORMER SELVES 
BEFORE THE REFORMATION THEY WERE ABLAZE WITH COLOUR 
IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE A VAST ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPT PAGE 
ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE ANALYSED HUNDREDS OF TINY MEDIEVAL PAINT SAMPLES 
FOUND ON THE WEST FRONT OF EXETER CATHEDRAL 
UNDER THE MICROSCOPE YOU CAN SEE THE BOLDNESS OF THE COLOUR 
THAT GAVE EACH STATUE A VIVID CHARACTER OF ITS OWN 
THE IDEA OF PAINTING STATUES MAY SEEM VULGAR NOW 
BUT THE EFFECT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE GARISH 
AT EXETER THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY TOMB OF BISHOP BRONSCOMBE 
STILL HAS ALL ITS ORIGINAL PAINT 
FANTASTICALLY DELICATE EFFECTS COULD BE OBTAINED 
FINE GRADATIONS OF GOLDS AND GREENS IN THE FOLDS OF THE DRAPERY 
REVEAL A SOPHISTICATED SENSE OF LIGHT AND SHADE 
PAINTING HELPED TO EMPHASISE THE THREE DIMENSIONALITY OF A SCULPTURE 
BUT THE ART OF THE CATHEDRAL WAS NOT DESIGNED 
FOR THE SILENT ADMIRATION OF THE CONNOISSEUR 
ONCE POLYPHONIC WALLS OF SOUND WOULD HAVE EMITTED FROM THESE GALLERIES ON HIGH 
CATHEDRALS WERE LIKE THEATRES OF RELIGION 
WREATHED WITH THE SMOKE OF INCENSE FILLED WITH NOISE AND COLOUR 
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN DANCING AS WELL AS PRAYING 
AND ON GREAT FEAST DAYS PLAYS AND PROCESSIONS 
BEHIND THESE ANGELS IN THE MINSTRELS' GALLERY WERE SINGERS 
THEIR VOICES AS IF COMING DOWN TO EARTH FROM HEAVEN 
WOULD HAVE BLASTED THROUGH THESE SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED OPENINGS 
INTOXICATION BY SPECTACLE AND MUSIC WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE CATHEDRAL 
IT WAS A PLACE OF SWOONING PASSIONATE BELIEF 
IT WAS THIS WORLD FULL OF LIGHT AND COLOUR AND SOUND 
THAT THE REFORMERS SET OUT TO STIFLE TO SILENCE 
AND TO SMASH 
THIS CHURCH IN WITHERSDALE STREET IN SUFFOLK 
ENCAPSULATES ALL THAT THE PROTESTANT REFORMERS BELIEVED IN 
IT'S A WHITE CUBE DEVOID OF ALL PARAPHERNALIA 
HOW EMPTY IT ALL IS 
ALL THAT'S LEFT OF THE ROOD SCREEN IS THIS STAIRCASE GOING NOWHERE 
THIS WAS THE BRAVE NEW WORLD ENVISAGED BY THE REFORMERS 
WITHERSDALE IS ONLY A FEW MILES FROM THE CHURCH AT WENHASTON 
HERE WE SEE A DIFFERENT KIND OF DOOM THAT OF CATHOLICISM IN BRITAIN 
THE LAST JUDGMENT PASSED BY THE PROTESTANT REFORMERS OF THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES 
IT HAS BEEN PURGED AND PURIFIED 
STRIPPED OF EVERY IMAGE AND RELIC 
AND EVERY LAST VESTIGE OF POPISH SUPERSTITION 
WITH MASS OUTLAWED THE ALTAR LOST ITS MYSTIQUE AND WAS NOW MORE LIKE AN ORDINARY TABLE 
TO AN ENGLISHMAN USED TO THE CUSTOMS OF THE OLD FAITH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REVOLUTIONARY 
IN THIS REFORMED FUNCTIONAL CHURCH THE TEN COMMANDMENTS WERE THE FOCUS 
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAD SOFTENED THE IMPACT OF THE SECOND COMMANDMENT 
FORBIDDING THE WORSHIP OF GRAVEN IMAGES BY RUNNING IT INTO THE FIRST 
BUT THE PROTESTANTS RESTORED IT TO ITS PRIOR STATUS 
THOU SHALT NOT MAKE UNTO THEE ANY GRAVEN IMAGE 
OR ANY LIKENESS OF ANYTHING THAT IS IN HEAVEN ABOVE 
OR THAT IS IN THE EARTH BENEATH 
OR THAT IS IN THE WATER UNDER THE EARTH 
THOU SHALT NOT BOW DOWN THYSELF TO THEM 
JOSIAH BEGAN TO PURGE JUDAH AND JERUSALEM 
FROM HIGH PLACES AND THE GROVES 
AND THE CARVED IMAGES 
AND THE MOLTEN IMAGES 
AND THEY BRAKE THE ALTARS OF BAALEM IN HIS PRESENCE 
AND THE IMAGES THAT WERE ON HIGH 
ABOVE THEM HE CUT DOWN 
AND THE GROVES AND THE CARVED IMAGES 
AND THE MOLTEN IMAGES HE BRAKE IN PIECES 
AND MADE DUST OF THEM 
AND STREWED IT UPON THE GRAVES OF THEM 
THAT HAD SACRIFICED UNTO THEM 
AND HE BURNT THE BONES OF THE PRIEST UPON THEIR ALTARS 
AND CLEANSED JUDAH AND JERUSALEM 
MANY A GRAPHIC VERSE IN THE BIBLE 
SERVED AS BLUEPRINTS FOR PROTESTANT IMAGE BREAKING 
AND ICONOCLASTIC KINGS OF JUDEA LIKE JOSIAH 
PROVIDED ROLE MODELS 
THE JEWS WERE TAUGHT TO BEWARE OF IDOLATROUS PRACTICES 
WITHIN THEIR OWN RELIGION 
AND TO BEWARE OF WHORING AFTER THE STRANGE GODS OF NEIGHBOURING TRIBES 
IN THE EYES OF THE REFORMERS 
PAPAL ROME BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECADENCE OF ANCIENT BABYLON 
WITH THE WORST EXCESSES OF IDOLATRY 
AND WITH THE ANTI CHRIST 
CATHOLIC RITUAL WAS SEEN AS A FORM OF SUPERSTITION 
WHERE THE VENERATION OF IMAGES DEGENERATED INTO THEIR OPEN WORSHIP 
DISPLACING THE WORSHIP DUE TO GOD ALONE 
THE MASS WAS DISMISSED AS TRICKERY MUMBO JUMBO 
WHICH TOOK IN THE CONGREGATION MAKING MONKEYS OF THEM 
THE DETERMINATION TO RID BRITAIN OF THIS JIGGERY POPERY 
WAS THE IMPETUS BEHIND ICONOCLASM 
ICONOCLASM WAS CARRIED FURTHER IN BRITAIN THAN ANYWHERE ELSE 
THE DESTRUCTION OF ART IN OTHER PROTESTANT COUNTRIES LIKE HOLLAND WAS MORE SPORADIC AND LESS THOROUGH 
IN BRITAIN THE NEW CHURCH PURSUED ITS ICONOCLASTIC POLICIES WITH BLANKET EFFICIENCY 
IT'S HARD TO BE PRECISE BUT NINETY FIVE TO NINETY NINE PER CENT OF ALL RELIGIOUS ART WAS DESTROYED 
IN SCOTLAND THE REFORMATION WAS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE 
NOT EVEN ONE PER CENT SURVIVED 
THE NEW PROTESTANT CLERGY SAW THE PURGING OF IMAGES AS THE PURIFYING OF PEOPLE'S MINDS 
THE METHODS OF DESTRUCTION WERE MEANT AS PURIFICATION 
WHITEWASH WAS ONE 
ANOTHER WAS FIRE 
HUNDREDS OF WOODEN IMAGES WERE TURNED INTO PUBLIC BONFIRES 
JOLLY MUSTERS AS ARCHBISHOP CRANMER CALLED THEM 
IT WAS MORALE BOOSTING PROTESTANT PROPAGANDA 
A NEW SPECTACLE TO REPLACE THE CATHOLIC CEREMONIES 
THERE'S SOMETHING FETISHISTIC ABOUT ICONOCLASM WHICH GOES TO SUCH LENGTHS 
THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND ENERGY 
SPENT DESTROYING AN IMAGE IS STILL TIME DEVOTED TO THAT IMAGE 
YOU'RE PERVERSELY RECOGNISING ITS STATUS 
THE PROTESTANTS PROTESTED A BIT TOO MUCH 
AS IF DEEP DOWN THEY FEARED THE IMAGE 
FEARED ITS EVIL EYE 
EYES ARE WHAT GIVE IMAGES LIFE 
SO THE ICONOCLASTS GOUGED OUT THE EYES OF THE OBJECTS 
THEY DEFACED THEM TOO LITERALLY TAKING THEIR FACES OFF 
IN ORDER TO TAKE AWAY THEIR POWER TO RESPOND 
AND GAZE BACK AS IF HUMAN 
THESE BLINDED SAINTS ARE ON THE ROOD SCREEN IN SAINT EDMUNDS SOUTHWOLD 
ONE OF THE STAMPING GROUNDS OF WILLIAM DOWSING 
A PURITAN ICONOCLAST OF THE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTIES WHO KEPT A JOURNAL OR LEDGER 
SOUTHWOLD APRIL EIGHTH WE BRAKE DOWN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SUPERSTITIOUS PICTURES 
AND FOUR CROSSES ON THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE VESTRY 
AND GAVE ORDER TO TAKE DOWN THIRTEEN CHERUBIM AND TWENTY ANGELS 
AND TO TAKE DOWN THE COVER OF THE FONT 
UFFORD AUGUST THIRTY FIRST 
WE BRAKE DOWN THE ORGAN CASES AND GAVE THEM TO THE POOR 
THE PROGRESS OF THE REFORMATION SEEMS RELENTLESS BUT THERE WERE POCKETS OF RESISTANCE 
THERE ARE MANY STORIES OF DOORS LOCKED AGAINST DESTROYERS 
OF WOMEN BANDING TOGETHER TO BAR THE ENTRANCES TO THEIR CHURCHES 
OF IMAGES HIDDEN FOR THE DAY WHEN THE CATHOLIC FAITH JUST MIGHT RETURN 
MOST OF THE ART SURVIVING IN BRITAIN FROM THE MIDDLE AGES WAS SAVED IN THIS WAY 
THERE IS A GLORIOUS COVER OVER THE FONT LIKE A POPE'S TRIPLE CROWN 
WITH A PELICAN ON THE TOP ALL GILT OVER WITH GOLD 
WE WERE KEPT OUT OF THE CHURCH TWO HOURS 
AND NEITHER CHURCHWARDENS THAT WERE ENJOINED AT THESE THINGS THREE MONTHS AFORE 
THIS HUGE FONT COVER IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT MARY IN UFFORD IN SUFFOLK 
HELD GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR BAPTISM 
THIS COVER STILL OPERATES ON ITS ORIGINAL MEDIEVAL COUNTERWEIGHTS 
IMAGINE IT BEING LIFTED UP THE CHILD PLACED BENEATH IT 
THE WEIGHT OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PROTECTING AND BEARING DOWN ON IT 
FONT COVERS WERE PRIME TARGETS FOR THE REFORMERS 
BUT UFFORD PARISHIONERS HAD OTHER IDEAS ABOUT THE FATE OF THEIRS 
AND THEY WOULD NOT LET HIM HAVE THE KEY 
NEITHER THE CHURCHWARDENS NOR CONSTABLE TOKELOVE NOR THE SEXTON 
WOULD LET US HAVE THE KEY 
THE UFFORD FONT COVER SURVIVED 
BUT ALL THE OTHERS IN THIS PART OF EAST ANGLIA NOT TO MENTION COUNTLESS OTHER OBJECTS DIDN'T 
THEY ONLY EXIST AS ENTRIES IN DOWSING'S GHOULISH ACCOUNT 
OF HOW HE SWEPT DOWN ON PARISHES 
STRADBROKE APRIL FOURTH EIGHT ANGELS AND CHERUBIM FROM THE ROOF 
FOUR CROSSES ON THE STEEPLE ONE ON THE PORCH 
SEVENTEEN PICTURES IN THE UPPER WINDOWS 
AND PRAY FOR SUCH OUT OF YOUR CHARITY AND ORGANS WHICH I BRAKE 
AT CLARE WE BRAKE ONE THOUSAND PICTURES SUPERSTITIOUS 
I BRAKE DOWN TWO HUNDRED 
FEBRUARY THIRD WENHAM PARVA 
WE BRAKE DOWN TWENTY SIX PICTURES AND GAVE ORDER FOR SIX MORE 
I GAVE ORDER TO LEVEL THE STEPS FEBRUARY THIRD WENHAM MAGNA 
THERE WAS NOTHING TO REFORM 
COPDOCK JANUARY TWENTY NINTH DID DEFACE A CROSS ON THE FONT 
BEHIND DOWSING'S BOASTFUL LITANY 
WE CAN HEAR MEDIEVAL CULTURE GOING GOING GONE UNDER THE HAMMER OF A NEW FAITH 
HIS VANDALISM WAS EVANGELISM 
THE REFORMATION IS OFTEN SAID TO BE THE MOMENT WHEN THE BRITISH CEASED TO BE VISUALLY AWARE 
BUT WITHERSDALE PROVES THAT A LIE OR AT LEAST A PROFOUND MISTAKE 
IT MAY BE A PLACE BUILT ON THE REJECTION OF IMAGERY 
A PLACE FROM WHICH CARVING PAINTING AND STAINED GLASS IS EXCLUDED 
IT MIGHT BE A PLACE WHERE THE WORD RULES 
SHINING IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF TRUTH BUT IT'S ALSO BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT 
THIS WHITENESS IS THE WHITENESS OF IDEALISM 
THE WHITENESS OF A FAITH WHICH TAUGHT PEOPLE TO READ 
A DEMOCRATIC WHITENESS 
THE WHITENESS OF A FAITH BUILT ON THE KILLING OF OLD SUPERSTITION A RATIONAL WHITENESS 
IT WILL BECOME THE WHITENESS OF SCIENTIFIC ENQUIRY OF THE HOSPITAL 
AND THE ANATOMY THEATRE 
IT'S THE WHITENESS OF A QUESTIONING CHALLENGING FAITH 
IT'S ALSO A DANGEROUS WHITENESS 
A WHITENESS MADE TO PRAISE GOD 
BUT WHICH MAY END UP BY QUESTIONING HIS VERY EXISTENCE 
BUT HAVING REJECTED THEIR PAST AND EUROPE 
THE BRITISH ALSO TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEIR OWN RADICALISM 
THEY SHUNNED THE RADICAL PURITY BEHIND THE WHITE CUBE 
BUT THE SAME VISION WAS DEVELOPED INTO A NATIONAL ART 
IN ANOTHER PLACE AND TIME BY ANOTHER ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLE 
AMERICA WAS THE NATION PRODUCED OUT OF THE FAILURE OF THE PURITAN MOMENT IN ENGLAND 
IT WAS FOUNDED WHEN THE EXTREMISTS LIKE THE MAYFLOWER PILGRIMS 
LEFT TO BUILD THEIR BRAVE NEW WORLD 
IT WOULD TAKE AMERICA THREE HUNDRED YEARS TO REDISCOVER ITS OWN ORIGINS IN ART 
IT DID SO TRIUMPHANTLY IN THE WORK OF THE NEW YORK SCHOOL 
BETWEEN THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
THIS IS THE FINAL DESTINATION OF AN AESTHETIC FIRST PIONEERED 
BY RADICAL CLERICS IN SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ENGLAND 
THE LINK IS RECOGNISED IN THE TITLES MANY AMERICAN POST WAR PAINTERS 
GAVE THEIR EMPTIED OUT PICTURES WHITEWASHED OR BLACKED OUT CANVASES 
WITH GRANDIOSE BIBLICAL TITLES LIKE ABRAHAM EVE AND THE WORD 
THESE WERE EXHIBITED INSIDE THE PURE WHITE CUBE OF THE ART GALLERY 
THAT INTIMIDATING SECULAR PARODY OF A PURITAN CHURCH 
IT SEEMS ECCENTRIC TO THINK OF PICTURES LIKE THESE AS MODERN ART 
THEY'RE SO NOSTALGIC FOR THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
AND FOR THE FIERCELY ANTI IMAGE MOSAIC LAW 
AND THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 
WHICH SO INSPIRED THE EARLY PROTESTANTS 
MANY AMERICAN ABSTRACT ARTISTS LIKE BARNETT NEWMAN WERE JEWISH 
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY AWARE OF THE JUDAIC DISTRUST OF IDOLS AND IMAGES 
THE AMERICAN ART THAT FOLLOWED THE NEWMANS ROTHKOS AND REINHARDTS 
WAS IF ANYTHING EVEN MORE AKIN TO THE OLD SPACES OF PURITAN WORSHIP 
WORD ART WAS INVENTED THE PURE WHITE CUBE WAS EMBELLISHED WITH TEXT 
LAWRENCE WIENER'S WORK WAS HAILED AS THE EPITOME OF MODERNISM IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE 
BUT IT'S REALLY JUST THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 
UP ON THE CHURCH WALL ALL OVER AGAIN 
IN BRITAIN THE HISTORY OF ART WOULD NOT TAKE THE AMERICAN COURSE 
NOR WOULD IT DEVELOP IN LINE WITH THE GREAT EUROPEAN TRADITION 
IT WOULD FOLLOW A MORE IDIOSYNCRATIC ROUTE 
IT WAS THE STRANGE FATE NOT JUST OF THE BRITISH ARTIST 
BUT OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE TO BE TORN FOREVER 
BETWEEN DESIRE FOR THE FUTURE AND INABILITY TO FORGET THE PAST 
THE BEST PLACE TO UNDERSTAND THIS NATIONAL DICHOTOMY WILL ALWAYS BE IN CHURCH 
HERE IN THE BLACK MOUNTAINS OF WALES THERE'S PLENTY OF WHITEWASH 
BUT AN IMAGE TOO 
A GRIM REAPER ETCHED IN OX BLOOD 
THAT SEEPS THROUGH INTO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY FROM THE BACK OF BEYOND 
THIS CHURCH AT PATRICIO IS NEITHER ONE THING NOR THE OTHER 
SOME CONFLICTS ARE NEVER RESOLVED AND THE REFORMATION WAS ONE OF THEM 
YOU CAN TRY TO SMOTHER OLD FEARS BUT NO MATTER HOW MANY LAYERS OF WHITE PAINT ARE APPLIED 
THE IMAGE ALWAYS FINDS A WAY BACK TO HAUNT THE BRITISH IMAGINATION 
THE TARGETS CHANGE THE TERROR DOES NOT 
THE BLOODY HISTORY OF FORTY YEARS OF TERRORISM
