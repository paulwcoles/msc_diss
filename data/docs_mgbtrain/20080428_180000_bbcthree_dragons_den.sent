THERE TONIGHT THEY WILL ONCE AGAIN MAKE OR BREAK THE BUSINESS DREAMS OF DOZENS OF BUDDING ENTREPRENEURS 
I'M NOT STUPID I CAN DO NUMBERS YOU'RE ASKING US TO LOSE MONEY 
SO HOW DID YOU GET TO A VALUATION OF HALF A MILLION POUNDS FOR THIS 
BELIEVE ME NO ONE WILL COPY THIS IDEA 
WHY WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT THIS 
THE DRAGONS HAVE ALL IT TAKES TO BE SUCCESSFUL 
FIVE OF BRITAIN'S MOST ENTERPRISING AND WEALTHY BUSINESS PEOPLE 
THEY'VE ALL BUILT UP THEIR OWN FORTUNES FROM SCRATCH 
JAMES CAAN MADE HIS MILLIONS BUILDING A GLOBAL BUSINESS 
IN THE RECRUITMENT INDUSTRY AND HE NOW HEADS AN INTERNATIONAL PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM 
THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION BUSINESS EMPIRE OF GLASWEGIAN ENTREPRENEUR 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE INCLUDES HOTELS CASINOS AND HEALTH CLUBS 
DEBORAH MEADEN EARNED HER FORTUNE IN THE HOLIDAY AND LEISURE INDUSTRY IN THE WEST COUNTRY 
THEO PAPHITIS IS A RETAIL MAGNATE WHO'S TRANSFORMED THE FORTUNES OF 
HIGH STREET BRANDS LIKE RYMAN LA SENZA PARTNERS AND CONTESSA 
AND ONE OF BRITAIN'S BEST KNOWN ENTREPRENEURS PETER JONES HAS BUILT UP A MULTI MILLION POUND EMPIRE 
WITH A BUSINESS PORTFOLIO THAT RANGES FROM TELECOMS AND LEISURE TO PROPERTY AND MEDIA 
IN THE DEN THE DRAGONS ARE READY TO BACK THE RIGHT BUSINESSES WITH THEIR OWN MONEY 
BUT TONIGHT WILL ANYONE CONVINCE THEM TO INVEST 
WELCOME TO THE DRAGONS' DEN 
WHERE MORE NERVOUS ENTREPRENEURS ARE WAITING TO PITCH THEIR 
BUSINESSES AND INVENTIONS TO OUR FIVE MULTI MILLIONAIRE INVESTORS 
ALL ENTREPRENEURS ARE CONVINCED THEY'LL MAKE MILLIONS BUT WILL THE DRAGONS SHARE THEIR VISION 
ONLY THE VERY BEST IDEAS WILL WIN MUCH NEEDED INVESTMENT BECAUSE IT'S THE DRAGONS' OWN MONEY AT RISK 
SO HOW WILL OUR FIRST ENTREPRENEURS COPE UNDER THE DRAGONS' SCRUTINY 
SORRY ABOUT THE DELAY 
HERE'S JACK 
WOW 
THE DRAGONS 
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M IN FRONT OF THE DRAGONS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER 
WELL I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF DAVID FIELD WHO'S THE COMPANY 
CALLED VIRTUAL PUPPET AND IT USES TECHNOLOGY 
LIKE THE SORT OF TECHNOLOGY YOU'RE SEEING RIGHT HERE 
VIRTUAL PUPPET IS OFFERING YOU 
THIRTY PER CENT STAKE IN THE COMPANY FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
VIRTUAL PUPPET HAS AN EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO 
MARKET THIS SYSTEM WITH ALL THE INTEGRAL OPERATING SYSTEMS 
THAT MAKE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE POSSIBLE 
TO MY LEFT YOU HAVE ALI ALI CHORD HE ACTUALLY INVENTED 
THIS SYSTEM ERM AND THAT'S REALLY IT ACTUALLY 
THAT'S ABOUT THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT O. K. THANK YOU 
PUPPETEER DAVID FIELD AND MOTION CAPTURE SPECIALIST ALI CHORD 
NEED A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND INVESTMENT TO MARKET THEIR INNOVATIVE SYSTEM 
WHICH INSTANTLY ANIMATES CARTOON CHARACTERS 
WEAVING DAVID'S ALTER EGO INTO THE PITCH HAS CERTAINLY GRABBED THE DRAGONS' ATTENTION 
BUT IT'S LEFT DUNCAN BANNATYNE FRUSTRATED AS TO WHAT THE BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY ABOUT 
SO YOU PUT THIS CONTRAPTIONS ON YOURSELF 
AND STAND BEHIND A SCREEN AND YOU BECOME A CARTOON CHARACTER 
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH 
WHY 
IT'S A NEW MEDIUM OF COMMUNICATION REALLY 
IT'S GREAT FUN MANY PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO DO IT FOR YEARS 
IT HAS BEEN DONE BUT COMPUTER PROCESSING POWER IS ONLY 
REALLY NOW AVAILABLE ON A MASS MARKET TO MAKE THIS AFFORDABLE 
SO IT'S AFFORDABLE IT IS AFFORDABLE 
O. K. WHAT DOES IT COST 
WE'RE MARKETING THIS SYSTEM FOR TWENTY THOUSAND 
THAT'S VERY AFFORDABLE ISN'T IT 
WHAT'S IT COST YOU BEFORE YOU SELL IT FOR TWENTY THOUSAND 
TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED 
SO IT COSTS YOU TEN THOUSAND YOU SELL IT FOR TWENTY THOUSAND M. M. M. H. M. M. WHO'S YOUR CUSTOMER 
WELL WE'RE GEARING IT TOWARDS BRANDING COMPANIES 
EXPERIENTIAL MARKETING COMPANIES EXHIBITION ORGANISERS 
YOU KNOW HIGH STREET OR DEPARTMENT STORES 
HOW MANY OF THESE CONTRAPTIONS HAVE YOU SOLD 
WELL WE'RE JUST BRINGING IT TO MARKET NOW 
LET ME ANSWER MY OWN QUESTION 
O. K. AND YOU TELL ME IF I'VE GOT IT RIGHT YOU'VE SOLD NONE 
NO I'VE GOT WE'VE GOT BUT YOU'VE SOLD NONE 
O. K. I'VE SOLD NONE BUT YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT O. K. WE'VE SOLD NONE 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE UNITS IT'S ACTUALLY HAVING CHARACTERS IT'S A MULTI 
OH I SEE I'M SORRY WHEN YOU SAID THIS WAS AFFORDABLE 
YEAH AND THEN YOU TOLD ME IT WAS TWENTY THOUSAND I ASSUMED 
SOMEBODY COULD BUY IT AND DO ALL THE THINGS WITH IT 
SO NOW IT'S TWENTY THOUSAND PLUS YOU HAVE TO BUY CHARACTERS OR SOMETHING 
ABSOLUTELY I PREFER LOOKING AT THE CHARACTER THAN YOU 
I ACTUALLY AM LISTENING TO HIM 
GO BEHIND THE SCREEN AND DO IT FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN COS I THINK IT'LL BE PROBABLY MORE INTERESTING 
SEE IF YOU CAN DO THE WHOLE PITCH BEHIND THE SCREEN 
DO YOU REALLY WANT ME TO DO IT YEAH YEAH YEAH ABSOLUTELY O. K. 
THE DRAGONS MIGHT BE WARMING TO DAVID'S GREMLIN BUT THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO GRASP 
HOW A SET UP THIS EXPENSIVE WILL EVER SECURE SIGNIFICANT SALES 
IF I BUY THIS SYSTEM FOR TWENTY THOUSAND 
YEAH DO I GET A CHARACTER WITH IT FOR FREE YOU DO YEAH 
WE DESIGN THE CHARACTER YEAH ONE CHARACTER YEAH 
IF I WANT MORE CHARACTERS HOW MUCH 
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT WE'VE GOT 
IF YOU REALLY WANT THIS CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE 
VERY VERY PRECISE AND STOP USING ALL THIS IT DEPENDS 
GUYS I'M GONNA COME OUT 
COS IT REALLY DOES DEPEND ON WHAT CHARACTER YOU WANT ON IT 
NO LISTEN TO ME YEAH 
JUST DO AVERAGES RIGHT 
O. K. SO WE CAN ALL MAKE EIGHT THOUSAND OTHERWISE WE CAN'T MAKE A DECISION 
SO A CHARACTER WOULD COST EIGHT THOUSAND ISH POUNDS 
YEAH SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY PRICING YOURSELF OUT OF THE MARKET 
BUT IT GOES DOWN 
THE THING IS HE'S THE FIRST GUY WHO'S TRIED IT HEY HEY HEY HEY 
WHO ELSE DOES THIS GUYS AS A WHOLE 
YEAH NOBODY WHO'S CAPABLE OF DOING IT 
REALLY NOBODY BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER SYSTEMS THAT DO THIS MOCK UP 
THEY NEED A STATIONERY TRIANGULATION SYSTEM WHICH THIS IS NOT 
THIS YOU CAN JUST WEAR AND GO WHEREVER 
O. K. YOU'RE TELLING ME NOBODY CAN DUPLICATE YOUR LITTLE MOVEMENT SENSORS YEAH ABSOLUTE RUBBISH 
RIGHT I'LL DO IT MYSELF O. K. YOU'VE GOT NO EXCLUSIVITY OF PRODUCT 
YOU MIGHT HAVE THAT PRODUCT BUT NOT OTHER PRODUCTS 
O. K. I ACCEPT THAT ALLS YOU ARE IS A SELLING AGENT DAVID YEAH 
AND YOU COULD BE COMPETING AGAINST TEN OTHER SELLING AGENTS YEAH IN THE MARKET THERE 
AND ON TOP OF THAT YOU WANNA TAKE 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF MY CHILDREN'S INHERITANCE FOR THIRTY PER CENT OF NOTHING 
IT'S ENJOYABLE 
IT'S NOT A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY FOR ME SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET MY CHILDREN'S MONEY 
O. K. AND I'M OUT 
THEO PAPHITIS DISAGREES WITH THE ENTREPRENEURS' CLAIMS 
AND IT'S PUSHED HIM AWAY FROM ANY POTENTIAL INVESTMENT 
PETER JONES CAN CONTAIN HIMSELF NO LONGER EITHER 
WHY WHY WHY 
WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT THIS BECAUSE IT'S FANTASTIC 
BUT WHO'LL SPEND TWENTY THOUSAND TO HAVE THAT IN THEIR HOUSE 
BIG COMPANIES SPEND SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT 
OH CAN I ASK YOU MORE SPECIFICALLY YEAH 
WHO DO YOU THINK IS YOUR BIGGEST MARKET 
WHO IS GONNA BE THE BIGGEST BUYER OF THIS PRODUCT 
DO YOU MIND IF I TURN THE VOICE DOWN WHILE I JUST YEAH TURN IT OFF 
WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE WE'RE GEARING IT TOWARDS BRANDING 
COMPANIES EXPERIENTIAL MARKETING COMPANIES SO BRANDING COMPANIES 
BRANDING COMPANIES WHAT IS A BRANDING COMPANY 
A BRANDING COMPANY IS SOMEONE WHO'S DEFINING WHAT A COMPANY IS 
IN TERMS OF HOW THEY'RE SEEN BY THE JOE PUBLIC 
O. K. I UNDERSTAND THAT AND WHAT WOULD A BRANDING COMPANY DO WITH THIS PRODUCT 
BRANDING COMPANIES REALLY NEED TO JUMP INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
THEY NEED TO BRING THEIR PRINTED IDEAS TO LIFE 
THEY NEED TO HAVE INTERACTIVE MARKETING SYSTEMS 
I'M CONFUSED I'M A PRIVATE EQUITY ACCOUNTANT IMAGINING I'M GONNA BUY THIS 
SO MY BRANDING COMPANY'S COME TO ME THEY'VE RECOMMENDED THIS 
SO HOW AM I GONNA USE THIS TO PROMOTE MY COMPANY 
YOU COULD ACTUALLY HAVE A CHARACTER THAT ACTUALLY TALKS TO 
THE PUBLIC GETS FEEDBACK HAS FUN WITH THE PUBLIC I DON'T GET IT O. K. 
DAVID'S IN TROUBLE HE'S FAILING TO CONVINCE THE REMAINING DRAGONS THAT 
THERE'S A LUCRATIVE MARKET FOR THE VIRTUAL PUPPET 
NOW DUNCAN BANNATYNE'S CURIOUS ABOUT THE PUPPETEER HIMSELF 
DAVID TELL ME ABOUT YOUR LIFE AS A PUPPETEER 
I SELL PUPPETS ON THE STREET WHAT KIND OF PUPPETS 
I SELL MONKEYS I SELL BIRDS I SELL MARIONETTES 
I SELL ALL SORTS OF PUPPETS HAVE YOU MADE A LIVING 
I WOULDN'T SAY I MAKE A BRILLIANT LIVING 
BUT YOU GET BY YEAH I GET BY 
AND YOU THINK THIS IS GONNA MAKE YOU A FORTUNE I THINK THIS IS YEAH 
I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC SYSTEM 
IT'S NOT 
I THINK YOU SHOULD CONTINUE DAVID TO SELL PUPPETS ON THE STREET 
I'M OUT RIGHT 
DAVID ALI I'M GONNA TAKE YOU FROM THE VIRTUAL WORLD TO THE REAL WORLD O. K. 
NICE QUIRKY FUN 
THE ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MONEY 
SO I QUESTION THE WHOLE APPLICATION WHERE I STARTED BEFORE WHY 
AND THAT'S WHY I WON'T INVEST IN YOU TODAY O. K. AND I'M OUT 
THE DUO'S PITCH IS CRUMBLING 
ONLY TWO DRAGONS NOW STAND BETWEEN THEM AND EXPULSION FROM THE DEN 
WILL JAMES CAAN THROW THEM THE LIFELINE THEY SO BADLY NEED 
THE ONLY THING I'VE COME UP WITH IN MY MIND IS TWO OBSERVATIONS 
ONE IS I'M HAVING A KIDDIES' PARTY I'VE GOT TWENTY KIDS IN A ROOM 
GOT A PLASMA AND YOUR PUPPET CAN TALK TO THE KIDS 
WELL NO ONE'S GONNA BLOW TWENTY GRAND ON A KIDS' PARTY WITH AN INTERACTIVE PUPPET 
OR YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A PLASMA IN A RECEPTION WHERE THE PUPPET TALKS TO PEOPLE 
I CAN'T SEE WHERE SOMEBODY WOULD PAY TWENTY TO THIRTY THOUSAND 
INCLUDING THE EIGHT THOUSAND ADD ON FOR THE CHARACTER 
SO I THINK IT IS NOT A BUSINESS VIABLE PROPOSITION 
FOR THAT REASON 
I'M OUT 
FOUR DRAGONS OUT IT'S ALL BUT OVER FOR DAVID AND ALI 
BUT DEBORAH MEADEN STILL WANTS SOME ANSWERS 
GIVE ME ONE PLACE YOU WILL SEE ONE OF THOSE BEING PUT 
IN THE HIGH STREET IN ALL RIGHT 
IF I WAS TRYING TO GET NATIONAL BRAND RECOGNITION HOW MANY HIGH STREETS WOULD I HAVE TO BE IN 
WITH THAT CHARACTER INTERACTING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
WELL I DON'T THINK IT WOULD WORK EXACTLY LIKE THAT BECAUSE I COULD SEE YOU KNOW 
SO HOW MANY WOULD IT BE QUITE A LOT 
WHAT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND IS YOU SEE YOU ARE GUESSING THE ANSWER 
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID ANSWERING THE QUESTION BECAUSE THE QUESTION ANSWERS YOUR ISSUE 
WHERE WOULD THIS ACTUALLY BE APPLIED 
WE CAN WE CAN 
THE APPLICATIONS ARE REALLY QUITE ENORMOUS WELL JUST GIVE ME ONE 
ERM ADVERTISING NO WHERE WHERE 
WHERE DO YOU ACTUALLY SEE ONE OF THOSE SITTING AND MAKING A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT ON BRAND 
WE'VE GOT ONE BOOKING AT THE MOMENT TO CREATE A DIGITAL CHARACTER 
THAT WELCOMES ALL THE PEOPLE INTO A BIG PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGING SEMINAR 
THAT'S CUTE THAT'S GREAT 
THAT'S GREAT THAT'S LOVELY 
THAT IS NOT A BIG MARKET 
I ALMOST DON'T WANT TO BE CRITICAL BECAUSE THIS IS FUN AND GREAT BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS 
YOU LOOK AT AND HAVE A BIT OF A LAUGH AT AND THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S DIFFERENT 
BUT IT'S NOT A BUSINESS YOU DON'T THINK IT'S A BUSINESS NO I DON'T 
I'M AFRAID THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH IN IT SO I'M OUT 
O. K. YOU'RE OUT THANKS GUYS 
DAVID AND ALI ARE LEAVING EMPTY HANDED 
THE DRAGONS LIKED THE TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH THEY JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A MONEY SPINNER 
MANY ENTREPRENEURS WHO CLIMB THE STAIRS INTO THE DEN 
HAVE HAD EUREKA MOMENTS OF THEIR OWN AND ARE CONVINCED THAT 
WITH INVESTMENT FROM THE DRAGONS THEIR IDEAS COULD MAKE MILLIONS 
KEEN GOLFER CAMILLA FREDERICK FROM SOMERSET WAS LOOKING FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INVESTMENT IN 
HER RANGE OF TWIN PEAKED CAPS WHICH SHE INVENTED AFTER TOO MANY WET AND WINDY ROUNDS ON THE GOLF COURSE 
COMME C. I. 
THE PEAKS ARE AT VARYING ANGLE TO THE CROWN 
THIS PEAK ACTUALLY SHADES YOUR FACE FROM THE GLARE 
THE BACK PEAK WHICH IS AT A STEEPER ANGLE COVERS YOUR NECK 
JAMES CAAN THOUGHT THE CAP SUITED HIM TO A TEE 
BUT THE DRAGONS WERE SOON PICKING HOLES IN CAMILLA'S SALES FIGURES 
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THREE YEARS YOU SELL AN AVERAGE OF FOUR PER WEEK 
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING IT TO SELL IT ON BIG QUANTITY BECAUSE 
OH YES YOU HAVE COME ON NOBODY STARTS IN BUSINESS NOT TO SELL THE PRODUCT 
THEO PAPHITIS THOUGHT HE'D SEEN IT ALL BEFORE 
THE IDEA'S NOT NEW IT'S BEEN AROUND A LONG LONG TIME HASN'T IT 
NO I DISAGREE O. K. I MEAN HOW COME IF I FILED FOR A PATENT 
YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'VE GOT A PATENT THAT PROTECTS 
I HAVE A PATENT PENDING WELL DON'T DO IT BECAUSE NOBODY IS GONNA COPY IT 
BELIEVE ME NO ONE WILL COPY THIS IDEA 
CAMILLA'S SESSION IN THE DEN WAS BROUGHT TO A SWIFT CLOSE 
I'M OUT 
DO I JUST WALK OUT YES 
HATS OFF TO HER SHE DID TRY OH 
MANY ENTREPRENEURS COME TO THE DEN WITH CLEVER INVENTIONS 
THEN FAIL TO CONVINCE THE DRAGONS THEY SOLVE ANY REAL PROBLEM 
SO HOW WILL JAMES HALLIBURTON FROM CHESHIRE FAIR UNDER THE SCRUTINY OF OUR MULTI MILLIONAIRES 
HE WANTS AN INVESTMENT OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
HI MY NAME IS JAMES HALLIBURTON 
I'M THE OWNER SLASH DIRECTOR OF SEATREIVER INTERNATIONAL 
THE EXCLUSIVE PRODUCERS OF THE PRODUCT FAMILY WATERBUOY 
I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR TEN PER CENT EQUITY IN MY COMPANY 
I'M SURE AT SOME POINT YOU'VE ALL BEEN ON BOATS AND YOU MAY EVEN BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO OWN YOUR OWN BOAT 
BUT I'M ALSO SURE YOU'VE FELT THE FEAR OF LOSING SOMETHING OVERBOARD 
WHETHER IT BE A SET OF CAR KEYS OR A VITAL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN OCEAN 
WATERBUOY IS A COMPLETELY UNIQUE MINIATURE FLOTATION DEVICE 
I'LL JUST LIKE TO GIVE YOU A DEMONSTRATION OF MY PRODUCT 
WATERBUOY WILL ACTIVATE IN LESS THAN TEN SECONDS 
AND THIS WILL LIFT ONE KILOGRAM 
I HAVE GOT A KILOGRAM WEIGHT IF YOU WISH ME TO PROVE IT ABSOLUTELY 
I HAVE TO DROP THIS IN SLOWLY SO I DON'T SMASH THE TANK 
NO NO DON'T WORRY 
THERE YOU GO IS THAT THE END OF YOUR PITCH 
THAT IS THE END OF MY PITCH YES 
IT'S A SLICK PRESENTATION FROM TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD JAMES HALLIBURTON 
WHO'S ASKING FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THE DRAGONS' OWN MONEY 
TO BACK HIS WATERBUOY MINIATURE FLOTATION DEVICE 
HE'S OFFERING THEM A TEN PER CENT STAKE IN HIS YOUNG COMPANY IN RETURN 
JAMES HELLO I'M THEO HI THEO 
YOU'VE JUST STUMBLED ON A PERSON WHO'S TAKEN DELIVERY OF HIS BRAND NEW YACHT 
OH RIGHT AND IT'S SITTING THERE IN PUERTO BANUS 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M INTO ANYTHING BOATING 
I'M GONNA ASK YOU SOME BASIC QUESTIONS 
O. K. I ASSUME THIS HAS GOT SOME FORM OF GAS INSIDE 
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF BASICALLY HOW IT WORKS 
THERE IS A GAS TANK IN THERE 
THERE'S A TRIGGER MECHANISM THERE AND THERE IS A LIGHT CONTAINING A BALLOON IN THERE 
WE'VE NOT ONLY PATENTED THIS AS A PRODUCT WE'VE PATENTED THIS 
AS THE TECHNOLOGY INSIDE ITSELF ALLOWING US TO EXPAND THE PRODUCT RANGE CREATING A PRODUCT FAMILY 
RIGHT NOW GIVE ME YOUR ONE TWO THREE YEAR PROJECTIONS 
YEAR ONE WE ESTIMATE TO MAKE JUST OVER SEVENTEEN MILLION YEAR TWO 
JUST OVER TWENTY FOUR YEAR THREE 
JUST OVER THIRTY SEVEN I THINK IT IS 
THREE POINT SEVEN 
THE DRAGONS SEEM IMPRESSED BY JAMES' CONFIDENT FINANCIAL FORECASTS 
BUT PETER JONES STILL NEEDS SOME CONVINCING ON THE PRODUCT'S UNIQUE SELLING POINT 
HI JAMES I'M PETER HI 
I'M MORE CONCERNED THAT YOU'D USE A CORK OR YOU'D USE OTHER PRODUCTS RATHER THAN THAT 
FOR JUST YOUR KEYS ODD KEYS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IF YOU USE A CORK BALL 
THESE ARE CUMBERSOME ITEMS YOU CAN'T FIT IN YOUR POCKET SO YOU WOULDN'T PUT A CORK BALL ON SAY YOUR KEYS 
ALSO THIS TECHNOLOGY IS SO EXPANDABLE WE CAN ASK IT TO LIFT AS LITTLE OR AS MUCH AS WE WANT 
SO WE CAN MAKE THIS NOT ONLY RESCUE YOUR KEYS TO YOUR BOAT BUT ALSO LIFT YOUR OWN BOAT 
AND JUDGING BY SORRY ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU COULD DEVELOP THIS FURTHER TO INCORPORATE 
OH COMPLETELY YEAH 
SOMEBODY FALLS OVERBOARD YOU CAN HOLD THEM UP YES COMPLETELY 
I MEAN THE AUTOMATIC LIFEJACKET FLOTATION INDUSTRY HAS ONLY GOT ONE TRIGGER OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT 
THIS IS A COMPLETELY RIVALLING TRIGGER TO IT 
JAMES HAS KEPT A COOL HEAD UNDER INTERROGATION FROM PETER JONES 
NOW DEBORAH MEADEN STEPS IN TO KEEP UP THE PRESSURE 
JAMES HAVE YOU ACTUALLY GOT ANY ORDERS ON THESE YET 
NOT AS CURRENT BUT WE'RE IN KEY DISCUSSIONS WITH PEOPLE 
WE AIM TO CLOSE IN THE NEXT FOUR TO SIX WEEKS 
JUST EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ORDERS YET 
BECAUSE AS I SAID THESE AREN'T OUR FINAL PRODUCTIONS UNITS THESE ARE MERELY OUR PROTOTYPE UNITS 
HOW TESTED IS THIS AS I EXPLAINED WE'VE TESTED ALL OF OUR PRE PRODUCTIONS 
PLEASE STOP SAYING AS EXPLAINED IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION AND I WAS 
SO JUST WHEN I ASK A QUESTION JUST TRY AND ANSWER IT FOR ME 
O. K. PRE PRODUCTION UNITS HAVE ALL BE TESTED TO DESTRUCTION MAKING SURE EACH ONE REACTED IN THE SAME TIME 
LIFTED THE SAME AMOUNT AND FLOATED FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME 
AND THAT'S THIS MODEL THAT'S THIS MODEL 
THE ENTREPRENEUR IS ADAMANT THAT HIS PRODUCT 
WILL STAND UP TO THE MOST RIGOROUS OF TESTING 
BUT WILL IT PASS THE THEO PAPHITIS TEST 
HOW ROBUST IS THIS 
THAT BALLOON IS NOT A NORMAL BALLOON IT'S ACTUALLY A STRENGTHENED BALLOON 
SO IF YOU GOT IT WITH YOU KNOW A BOATING HOOK YEAH 
IT WOULDN'T POP CAN I POP IT WITH MY HAND 
YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE A PRETTY IS IT WORTH TRYING 
THEO YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT OH I TELL YOU WHAT I CAN'T 
YES YOU CAN THERE YOU GO 
BUT YOU SEE THAT'S QUITE A LOT OF FORCE YOU HAVE TO PUT ON THAT TO ACTUALLY BREAK THAT 
JAMES IS REFUSING TO WAVER UNDER SCRUTINY 
NOW JAMES CAAN WANTS TO GRILL HIM ON THE DEAL HE'S OFFERING THE DRAGONS 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEIR OWN CASH IN RETURN FOR TEN PER CENT OF A FLEDGLING BUSINESS 
FOR A BUSINESS THAT HAS GOT NO CONFIRMED ORDERS THAT HASN'T 
SOLD ANYTHING YOU'RE VALUING THE BUSINESS AT TWO MILLION POUNDS 
I AM INDEED YES DOES THAT NOT SOUND A BIT AMBITIOUS 
I VALUE THE BUSINESS ON TWO SIDES 
ONE THE POTENTIAL SALES PROJECTIONS WE'VE GOT 
IF OUR SALES PROJECTIONS WHICH I VIEW TO BE CONSERVATIVE 
AT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND WE LOOK TO GET FOUR MILLION PROFIT BY THE END OF YEAR FOUR 
WHICH IS A COMPLETELY HYPOTHETICAL AND THEORETICAL NUMBER 
IT IS A COMPLETELY HYPOTHETICAL ORDER YOU ARE CORRECT 
BUT I VIEW IT'S A CONSERVATIVE ORDER ON THIS BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY AS AN INVESTOR IS YOUR CALL 
IT'S A TOUGH LINE FROM THE ENTREPRENEUR 
GIVEN THAT HIS VALUATION CAN ONLY BE BASED ON FUTURE NET PROFITS THAT HE HIMSELF IS PREDICTING 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE ISN'T BUYING IT 
JAMES I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I AM I'D BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE VALUATION 
I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUSLY HIGH 
O. K. AND SO FOR THAT REASON I'M NOT GONNA INVEST AND SO I'M OUT 
JAMES I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHERE I AM I'VE HOVERED FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY CREDIBLE 
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN IS YOU TO STAND HERE TODAY AND SAY 
I'VE GOT SOME AT LEAST LETTERS OF INTENT OR SOMETHING ON MY BOOKS 
SO THAT KIND OF BOTHERS ME A LITTLE BIT 
AND THEREFORE I'M AT THIS STAGE GONNA DECLARE MYSELF OUT 
O. K. THANK YOU 
TWO DRAGONS HAVE WALKED AWAY FROM THE DEAL 
BUT THE THREE REMAINING INVESTORS SUDDENLY SEEM RELUCTANT TO SAY WHERE THEY ARE 
AN UNUSUAL SILENCE DESCENDS ON THE DEN 
O. K. LET ME TELL YOU WHERE I AM 
I WILL MAKE YOU AN OFFER FOR THE FULL TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
M. M. M. H. M. M. 
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THE VALUATION THAT YOU'RE PUTTING ON THE BUSINESS 
YEAH I'D BE LOOKING FOR NO LESS THAT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
OF THE COMPANY 
THEO PAPHITIS HAS OFFERED JAMES ALL THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HE'S AFTER BUT FOR A QUARTER OF HIS COMPANY 
PETER JONES AND JAMES CAAN HAVE YET TO DECLARE THEIR POSITION 
WHAT ARE YOU PROJECTING IN YEAR ONE 
THE NET PROFIT FOR YEAR ONE WAS SEVENTEEN 
IN YEAR ONE YEAH 
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TEN PER CENT 
I THINK I TOO WILL MAKE AN OFFER FOR THE FULL AMOUNT 
I WILL 
DO THAT FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
IN A BID TO CLINCH THE DEAL FOR HIMSELF JAMES CAAN HAS UNDERCUT THEO PAPHITIS BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
PETER JONES HAS REACHED HIS DECISION TOO 
I THINK THERE'S A BIT OF A BENEFIT IF I ROLL THE DICE AS WELL 
O. K. 
I'M GONNA OFFER THE SAME PERCENTAGE RATIO AS THEO 
AND I'M GONNA OFFER 
TO PUT UP HALF THE MONEY 
BECAUSE POTENTIALLY YOU COULD HAVE TWO DRAGONS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE 
THAT DOES GIVE AN INTERESTING PROSPECT 
IF THEO WOULD BE INTERESTED 
IF IT MAKES IT HAPPEN THEN IT WOULD BE A PLEASURE O. K. 
WITH THREE DRAGONS ALL VYING FOR A STAKE IN WATERBUOY 
JAMES SUDDENLY FINDS HIMSELF IN A STRONG POSITION 
BUT CAN HE NEGOTIATE THE RIVAL DRAGONS DOWN ON THEIR EQUITY DEMANDS 
WOULD YOU TWO 
COME TO A PERCENTAGE OF TWENTY TWO PER CENT 
I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK AND FEEL THAT I NEED TO MATCH JAMES' OFFER 
HE NEEDS TO TRY AND STRUGGLE TO GET INVESTMENT 
HE'S GOT NO TRACK RECORD I THINK IT'S THE RISK YOU'VE GOTTA TAKE 
I CAME IN AT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT BECAUSE I FELT THAT WAS A FAIR VALUATION MADE IT WORTH MY WHILE 
BUT IF YOU WANT ME THEN I WILL STRUGGLE TO COME DOWN BELOW THAT FIGURE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU JAMES 
A TOUGH TALKING THEO PAPHITIS AND PETER JONES WON'T DISCOUNT THEIR 
OFFER TO THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT ON THE TABLE FROM THE SOLITARY JAMES CAAN 
IT'S DECISION TIME FOR THE YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR 
I FEEL THE BEST PERCENTAGE INVESTMENT IS FROM YOURSELF JAMES 
I FEEL THE EXPERIENCE OF THE TWO DRAGONS AT THIS POINT IN 
WHERE I AM IN THE BUSINESS MAY BE A BETTER OPTION FOR ME TO RUN TO 
SO IF I GET THIS RIGHT THE DEAL IS ON THE TABLE ON THE MOMENT WHICH IS TWENTY FIVE PER CENT FOR BOTH DRAGONS 
I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THAT DEAL 
WELL DONE YOU'VE GOTTA DEAL MATE 
JAMES HAS DONE IT HE'S SECURED THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND INVESTMENT HE NEEDS 
ALONG WITH THE EXPERIENCE AND BUSINESS ACUMEN OF PETER JONES AND THEO PAPHITIS 
WELL DONE JAMES VERY WELL DONE THANK YOU ARE YOU FEELING HAPPY 
YES I THINK SO YES 
IT'S NOT QUITE THE DEAL YOU WANTED IS IT 
NO IT WASN'T QUITE THE EQUITY PER CENT I WANTED TO PART WITH TODAY 
BUT WITH THE ADDED ENTHUSIASM FROM PETER AND FROM THEO THIS GIVES ME 
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FORWARDING THE BUSINESS AT A LOT FASTER RATE 
WELL DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
DEN RULES DICTATE THAT THE DRAGONS NEVER KNOW WHO OR WHAT IS ABOUT TO APPEAR BEFORE THEM NEXT 
BUT THEIR EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS ACUMEN MEANS IT DOESN'T TAKE THEM LONG TO SPOT THE ONES THEY 
THINK HAVE INVESTMENT POTENTIAL AND THE ONES THAT DON'T 
I'M OUT I'M OUT I'M OUT I'M OUT 
I'M OUT I'M OUT 
SOCCER ENTHUSIASTS VAUGHN LOVELOCK AND GREG RENK WANTED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR A TWENTY PER CENT STAKE IN GOLD BAND 
A SILICON COATED HEADBAND TO HELP FOOTBALLERS HIT THE BACK OF THE NET EVERY TIME 
IT'S A REVOLUTIONARY PRODUCT THAT WILL TRANSFORM THE GAME 
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL GRIP TO A PLAYER AND IMPROVING HIS ACCURACY 
PETER JONES KICKED OFF BY WONDERING WHAT THE HEADBAND WOULD DO TO A PLAYER'S IMAGE 
DO FOOTBALLERS LIKE TO LOOK GOOD WHEN THEY PLAY FOOTBALL 
YES WHAT I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO DO IS NOT TO SMILE 
JAMES CAAN THOUGHT THE DUO WERE OFFSIDE WITH THEIR COMPANY VALUATION 
SO HOW DID YOU GET TO A VALUATION OF HALF A MILLION POUNDS FOR THIS 
WELL IT'S LIKE ALL THESE VALUATIONS WHEN A COMPANY STARTS OFF 
IT'S FORECASTING AND IT'S A BIT OF A CRYSTAL BALL TO BE HONEST WITH YOU 
BUT DUNCAN BANNATYNE DIDN'T NEED A CRYSTAL BALL TO SEE WHERE THE BUSINESS HAD GONE WRONG 
HOW MANY HAVE YOU GOT HAVE YOU GOT SOME STOCK I'VE GOT FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
SO WHEN DID YOU BUY THEM 
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO AND YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ANY 
EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY YEAH WE'VE SOLD EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY 
WHEN I TAKE IT AWAY DOES IT SAY STUPID 
NO IT WOULDN'T SAY STUPID I'M NOT STUPID 
YOU'VE HAD THESE FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS YOU CAN'T SELL THEM BECAUSE NOBODY 
WANTS THEM SO THAT'S WHY I'M OUT 
GINNY AND COLIN STANWELL SMITH FROM NORFOLK ALREADY MANUFACTURE AND INSTALL FLOATAWAY THERAPY TANKS 
IN SPAS AND HEALTH CLUBS THEY WANTED A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TO LAUNCH THEIR OWN CHAIN OF FLOTATION CENTRES 
THE SIMPLE STATE OF FLOATING IN A WARM SALTY BATH 
IS THE MOST RELAXING AND STRESS RELIEVING ON EARTH 
BUT THE DEN DIDN'T STAY STRESS FREE FOR LONG AFTER A REVELATION BY THE COUPLE 
WOULD YOU CONSIDER AN INVESTMENT IN THE WHOLE OF YOUR BUSINESS 
NO WE DON'T WANT TO SELL PART OF OUR MANUFACTURING BUSINESS I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO MUG ME 
SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY WELL I DO BECAUSE YOUR IDEA IS NOT EXACTLY 
QUITE AS WATERTIGHT AS YOUR PRODUCT 
COS YOU'RE JUST RIPPING ME OFF THAT'S BOTTOM LINE 
JAMES CAAN THOUGHT THE COUPLE'S BUSINESS PLAN WAS UNDERPINNED BY OVER OPTIMISM 
LOGIC COMMON SENSE TELLS ME NO BUSINESS CAN RUN 
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TWELVE HOURS A DAY FIFTY TWO WEEKS A YEAR ON A ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OCCUPANCY 
I THINK AS A PROPOSITION THAT DOESN'T WORK 
IN THE END IT ALL GOT TOO MUCH FOR DUNCAN BANNATYNE 
I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE 
JUST CLOSE THE LID TELL ME WHEN YOU'VE FINISHED 
JUST CLOSE THE LID 
HAVE THEY FINISHED 
SO FAR TONIGHT THE DRAGONS HAVE INVESTED IN JUST ONE YOUNG INVENTOR AND HIS PRODUCT 
BUT WILL ANY OF THESE OPTIMISTIC ENTREPRENEURS PERSUADE THE DRAGONS 
TO BACK THEIR IDEAS WITH THEIR OWN CASH 
I'M ACTUALLY INSULTED THAT YOU'VE COME HERE TODAY AND ASKED US AT THIS LEVEL 
IT'S AS USEFUL AS A NODDING DOG ON THE BACK PARCEL SHELF OF A CAR 
I CAN SEE THIS BUSINESS HAVING POSSIBLY POTENTIAL 
BUT IT IS VERY RISKY 
NEXT UP IS ANNE HEMPSTOCK FROM DALBEATTIE NEAR DUMFRIES 
SHE ALREADY HAS EXPERIENCE OF LAUNCHING A RANGE OF DRINKS 
BUT WILL THE DRAGONS SEE POTENTIAL IN HER LATEST VENTURE 
SHE'S LOOKING FOR AN INVESTMENT OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
HELLO MY NAME IS ANNE HEMPSTOCK 
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY NEW PRODUCT CREAM CUTIE 
AND I'M SEEKING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND INVESTMENT FOR TWENTY PER CENT OF MY COMPANY 
CREAM CUTIE IS AN ALL NATURAL CHOCOLATE AND ORANGE WINE BASED CREAM LIQUEUR 
WITH NO ARTIFICIAL INGREDIENTS PRESERVATIVES OR E. NUMBERS 
WHICH GIVES A MUCH LIGHTER AND FRESHER TASTE SENSATION 
WHEN WE LOOKED TO GO INTO THE CREAM LIQUEUR MARKET WE KNEW WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
MOST PEOPLE HAVE A BIG BOTTLE OF CREAM LIQUEUR IN THEIR CUPBOARD THEY'VE DRUNK HALF WITH FRIENDS 
PUT IT IN THE CUPBOARD AND FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT 
OUR RESEARCH SHOWED THE CONSUMERS WANTED A SMALLER BOTTLE SIZE 
MOST IMPORTANTLY WE KNEW WE HAD TO BRING IT IN AT THE RETAIL PRICE POINT OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
WHICH IS A GREAT IMPULSE BUY PRICE POINT AND GREAT FOR A NEW PRODUCT 
WE LAUNCHED CREAM CUTIE AT THE SPECIALITY SHOW IN LONDON LAST YEAR 
AND CREAM CUTIE FOUND IT'S ROUTE TO MARKET THROUGH SPECIALITY SHOPS 
DELICATESSENS FOOD HALLS AND QUALITY TOURIST OUTLETS 
ASDA GAVE ME MY FIRST BIG BREAK LAST MONTH AND HAVE GIVEN ME 
SEVEN STORES IN SCOTLAND WITH A FURTHER THIRTY ONE COMING ONLINE IN SEPTEMBER 
SPAR SCOTLAND ARE ALSO TAKING CREAM CUTIE THIS CHRISTMAS 
I'M SEEKING THE INVESTMENT TO RAISE THE PROFILE OF CREAM CUTIE 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY SOME 
WELL I WOULD WHY NOT O. K. LET'S TRY SOME 
ANNE HEMPSTOCK IS CONFIDENT SHE CAN BUILD A SUCCESSFUL DRINKS BRAND 
AROUND HER CREAM CUTIE CHOCOLATE AND ORANGE CREAM LIQUEUR 
IF SHE CAN SECURE AN INVESTMENT OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN RETURN FOR A TWENTY PER CENT STAKE 
HI ANNE I'M JAMES HI WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND 
WHAT SORT OF THINGS HAVE YOU DONE 
MY BACKGROUND IS I'VE ALREADY DEVISED AND SOLD ON TWO BRANDS 
ONE WAS A SUGAR FREE DRINKS BRAND AND THE OTHER WAS A VODKA ALCOPOP BRAND 
AND I THEN BROUGHT OUT A WHISKEY BRAND WHICH IS ON SALE IN HARRODS 
AND I LOOKED INTO THE CREAM LIQUEUR MARKET AND BROUGHT THIS ONE OUT 
TELL ME HOW SUCCESSFUL THE OTHER BRANDS THAT YOU'VE DEVELOPED HAVE BEEN 
THE OTHER BRANDS WELL I SOLD THE FIRST ONE ON 
I MOVED ON THEN TO 
WHAT DID YOU GET FOR THAT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
O. K. I THEN MOVED ON TO MY ER VODKA ALCOPOP BRAND 
WEE BEASTIE AND I SOLD THAT FOR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TO A WHISKEY COMPANY 
AND TELL ME A LITTLE ABOUT THE NUMBERS 
WHAT SORT OF VOLUME HAVE YOU SOLD THE PRODUCT IN SO FAR 
I'VE SOLD ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND BOTTLES SO FAR IN SIX MONTHS 
WHAT DOES IT COST TO MAKE WHAT DOES IT COST A BOTTLE EACH 
THE COMPLETE COST IS ABOUT A POUND 
IT'S A POUND COSTS YOU A POUND WHAT'S YOUR WHOLESALE PRICE 
ON AVERAGE IT'S ONE HUNDRED TWENTY A BOTTLE 
I'M ONLY MAKING ABOUT ON AVERAGE TWENTY P. A BOTTLE 
O. K. 
ANNE CLEARLY KNOWS THE BUSINESS BUT HER PROVEN TRACK RECORD 
HAS RAISED MORE QUESTIONS THAN IT'S ANSWERED FOR THEO PAPHITIS 
HOW PASSIONATE ARE YOU ABOUT THIS 
VERY PASSIONATE OR I WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE YOU BELIEVE IN IT 
YES I DO AND I'VE PROVEN IT SELLS AND I THINK IT CAN GO FURTHER THAN IT'S GONE AT THE MOMENT 
SO IF YOU BELIEVE IN IT WHY ARE YOU OFFERING ME TWENTY PER CENT FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
YOU'VE JUST ADMITTED YOU'VE GOT 
YOU'VE SOLD TWO BRANDS SO YOU'VE HAD 
OVER HALF A MILLION POUNDS YEAH YOU'VE HAD 
SO WHY ARE YOU GONNA SHARE THIS GREAT SUCCESS 
WITH THE REST OF US WHEN REALLY YOU COULD PUT YOUR OWN MONEY INTO IT 
FIRST THAT OVER HALF A MILLION IS OVER TEN YEARS WHICH DOESN'T REALLY WORK OUT AT VERY MUCH 
I'VE INVESTED WHEN I'VE DONE 
WHEN I SOLD THE FIRST BRAND I USED THAT TO PAY OFF ALL MY DEBTS AND TO GIVE MYSELF SOME SECURITY 
AND THE EXTRA CASH I'VE PUT INTO THIS BRAND 
AND I'M HERE BECAUSE I WANT THE PROFILE A DRAGON CAN BRING TO THE BRAND 
ANNE'S HOLDING HER OWN UNDER A GRILLING ABOUT HER FINANCES 
NOW PETER JONES TURNS HIS GAZE TO THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF CREAM CUTIE 
ANNE I'M PETER HELLO 
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHY YOU JUSTIFY YOUR COMPANY BEING 
WORTH THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION POUNDS WHEN YOU MAKE DIDDLY SQUAT 
IT'S A LONG TERM I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT 
CREAM CUTIE AND I'LL HANG ON IN THERE I MEAN I'VE PROVEN IT SELLS 
NO NO NO I ACTUALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT THAT'S THE VALUATION THAT I WOULD 
THAT'S THE THE THE COST 
I'D NEED IF I HAVE TO SELL IT NOW BECAUSE I THINK I'VE WORKED HARD TO PRODUCE THE BRAND 
I'VE BROUGHT IT TO MARKET AND PROVEN IT SELLS AND 
GOT IT INTO THE SUPERMARKETS AND I'VE GOT IT ALMOST THERE 
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY MONEY BUT IT WILL MAKE MONEY 
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT MAKING MONEY NOW 
IT MIGHT BE FOR YOU BUT NOT FOR ME 
YOU GOT TOLD YOU GOT TOLD WHAT 
I'VE NEVER HEARD SO MUCH NONSENSE IN ALL MY LIFE 
THAT'S ABSOLUTE RUBBISH AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU VALUE A BUSINESS BASED ON IT'S ABILITY TO MAKE MONEY 
YES SO IF YOUR COMPANY IS NOT MAKING ANY MONEY AND HASN'T PROVEN 
THE ABILITY THAT IT CAN MAKE MONEY YOU'RE WORTH NOTHING 
WELL IT'S THE INVESTMENT IT'S THE LONG TERM INVESTMENT FOR A BRAND 
EVERY BRAND HAS TO START SOMEWHERE 
IT JUST DOESN'T COME UNLESS YOU'RE A BIG COMPANY BUT WHAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION FOR YOUR VALUATION 
THE JUSTIFICATION IS THAT'S THE MONEY I WOULD LOOK FOR IF I WANTED TO SELL IT NOW 
BUT NOBODY'S GONNA BUY IT WELL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BUY IT 
BUT SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT BUY IT WHY YOU THINK THERE'S IDIOTS OUT THERE 
BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL OF THE BRAND 
PETER JONES ISN'T CONVINCED BY ANNE'S REBUTTAL 
AND DUNCAN BANNATYNE ISN'T GOING TO LET THE ISSUE LIE 
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR TWENTY PER CENT 
YES IN THREE YEARS' TIME WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL SELL THE BRAND FOR 
A MILLION POUNDS WELL I SAID THAT 
THAT WAS MAYBE A BIT ENTHUSIASTIC 
BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT IT WOULD BE AT LEAST 
SO IT MIGHT BE LESS THAN A MILLION WELL I WOULD HOPE IT WOULD BE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS 
WELL IF YOU SELL IF FOR SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THREE YEARS TIME YES 
THE INVESTOR WITH TWENTY PER CENT AND PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOR IT WILL HAVE TWENTY PER CENT OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WHICH HAPPENED TO COME TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND SO THAT MEANS WE'LL LOSE THIRTY THOUSAND 
YEAH WELL THAT'S WHY I SAID THE MILLION BECAUSE I'M HOPING 
WELL O. K. LET'S GO TO THE MILLION FIGURE 
IF WE INVEST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND NOW FOR TWENTY PER CENT RIGHT 
RIGHT AND YOU SELL IT IN THREE YEARS' TIME FOR A MILLION POUNDS I GET TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BACK YES 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOOD 
NO BUT I'M HOPING IT'LL BE MORE THAN A MILLION POUNDS 
BUT YOU'VE SAID IT MIGHT BE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND OH FOR GOD'S SAKE SO FAR I CAN LOSE THIRTY THOUSAND 
THAT'S WHAT I CAN MAKE OUT OF THE BANK BY GETTING UP TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
BUT THERE'S SOME SKY HIGH THING IN YOUR DREAMS UP HERE THAT 
HOW DO YOU GET IF I SELL IT FOR A MILLION YOU ONLY GET TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
BECAUSE I'LL ONLY OWN TWENTY PER CENT 
YOU SELL IT FOR A MILLION YOU GET EIGHTY PER CENT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND 
I GET TWENTY PER CENT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND COME ON YOU'RE TAKING THE MICHAEL ANNE 
NO I'M NOT TAKING THE MICHAEL 
I BELIEVE IN THE BRAND AND I MIGHT SELL IT FOR TWO MILLION OR FOR THREE MILLION 
ANNE I THINK YOU'VE SPENT TOO LONG IN THE ALCOHOLIC DRINKS INDUSTRY 
I'M SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY GETTING HACKED OFF 
EVEN IF YOU DO SELL SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FIFTY THOUSAND BOTTLES A MONTH WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'RE GONNA GET TO 
BUT EVEN IF YOU DID YOU'RE GONNA MAKE EIGHT THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED A MONTH PROFIT GROSS PROFIT 
M. M. M. H. M. M. IT'S A JOKE O. K. 
I WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THAT 
WELL OF COURSE YOU WOULD BUT I WOULDN'T SO I'M OUT 
O. K. ANNE I'M ACTUALLY INSULTED THAT YOU'VE COME HERE TODAY AND ASKED US AT THIS LEVEL 
I'M NOT STUPID I CAN DO NUMBERS 
YOU'RE ASKING US TO LOSE MONEY 
I'M NOT HERE TO LOSE MONEY I'M HERE TO MAKE MONEY SO I'M OUT O. K. 
ANNE I THINK I'D RATHER HIT THE BOTTLE THAN INVEST IN THIS 
BECAUSE I WOULD LOST MY MONEY SO I TOO NOW AM OUT 
IN A DEVASTATING FLURRY THREE ANGRY DRAGONS HAVE DECLARED THEMSELVES OUT 
IS DUNCAN BANNATYNE ABOUT TO ADD TO ANNE'S WOES 
ANNE I'M NOT SURE IF YOU MISUNDERSTOOD BUT IN ORDER FOR YOU TO GIVE THE INVESTOR 
HIS MONEY BACK IN THIS YOU'D HAVE TO SELL THIS COMPANY FOR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND JUST TO GIVE THE INVESTOR BACK HIS MONEY 
M. M. M. H. M. M. AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVEN GONNA ACHIEVE THAT 
O. K. YOU MIGHT ACHIEVE A MILLION BUT IT'S STILL NOT A GREAT RETURN 
I COULD PUT MY MONEY IN A BANK AND GET INTEREST ON IT AND DO BETTER THAN THAT 
SO THIS WON'T GIVE ANYBODY A RETURN AND SO FOR THAT REASON I'M OUT O. K. 
ANNE'S HOPES OF SECURING THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND INVESTMENT ARE FADING FAST 
WILL JAMES CAAN SEE ENOUGH POTENTIAL TO INVEST IN HER 
ANNE I'VE BEEN VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOU 
I THINK YOU'VE DONE REMARKABLY WELL 
YOU'VE BUILT TWO SUCCESSFUL BRANDS 
YOU'VE MADE MONEY OUT OF THEM AND I THINK FOR YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL 
YOU PROBABLY WILL MAKE SOME MONEY OUT OF THIS 
BUT I THINK WITH YOUR OWN NUMBERS YOU'VE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THAT YOU'VE OVERVALUED THE BUSINESS 
O. K. AND FOR THAT REASON I'M OUT 
I'LL PROVE YOU ALL WRONG I'LL BE BACK ONE DAY 
THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC FANTASTIC WE'LL ALL BE PLEASED GOOD LUCK 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU 
A DEFIANT ANNE HEMPSTOCK IS LEAVING THE DEN WITHOUT AN INVESTMENT 
UNABLE TO CONVINCE THE MULTI MILLIONAIRES THEY'D MAKE ANY MONEY BY BACKING HER 
EVERYONE WHO DARES TO COME INTO THE DEN THINKS THEIR IDEA WILL MAKE THEM A FORTUNE 
BUT FEW SUCCEED IN PERSUADING THE DRAGONS TO PART WITH THEIR MONEY 
AMONG THOSE WHO TRIED IN THE DEN AND FAILED INCLUDED ESSEX BASED ELECTRICAL DESIGN ENGINEER 
DAVID HAYDON WHO WANTED SIXTY THOUSAND OF INVESTMENT IN HIS INVENTION DESIGNED TO REDUCE HOME HEATING COSTS 
HOW DOES IT WORK BUILT INTO IT ARE SMALL FANS 
THAT SUCK THE WARM AIR FROM THE REAR OF A RADIATOR ALLOWING YOUR ROOM TO HEAT UP IN HALF THE TIME 
WHICH ENABLES YOUR HEATING SYSTEM TO SHUT DOWN MUCH SOONER SAVING YOU ENERGY 
PETER JONES WAS LUKEWARM FROM THE START 
I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS O. K. 
IMAGINE TWO OR THREE OF THOSE AROUND YOUR HOUSE YOU'D JUST HAVE THAT CONTINUOUS HUMMING 
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA CATCH ON 
DEBORAH MEADEN DIDN'T OFFER DAVID ANY ENCOURAGEMENT EITHER 
THERE'S DUST BEHIND MOST PEOPLE'S RADIATORS AND I JUST HAPPEN TO SUFFER FROM ALLERGIES 
SO I'VE NOW GOT A NOISY DEVICE A DEVICE THAT'S CIRCULATING DUST 
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I AM DAVID IT'S REALLY REALLY QUICK I DON'T LIKE IT SO I'M OUT 
AND THEO PAPHITIS SUMMED UP THE PITCH AS ONLY HE CAN 
IT'S AS USEFUL AS A NODDING DOG ON THE BACK PARCEL SHELF OF A CAR 
O. K. IT'S NOT GOT A USE I'M OUT 
BUSINESS COMBO ANDREW BRODIE NOEL AKERS AND TARIQ MIRZA 
WANTED A FIFTY THOUSAND INVESTMENT IN THEIR INTERACTIVE INSOLES FOR CHILDREN'S SHOES 
LET ME INTRODUCE TO THE WORLD OF BAMS YOU PLACE THIS INTO THE SHOE 
AND AS SOON AS PRESSURE IS APPLIED IT ACTIVATES THE MESSAGE 
THE MESSAGE IS PROGRAMMABLE SO THE CHILD CAN INPUT ANY MESSAGE THEY WANT 
BUT THEIR BAMS BRANDING BEMUSED AND BAFFLED PETER JONES 
WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU USE SUCH A TERRIBLE NAME WHERE DOES THAT NAME COME FROM 
WE CAME UP WITH THE BRAND NAME WHICH WAS BASED AROUND OUR SURNAMES 
BRODIE AKERS AND MIRZA 
UGH 
THE DRAGONS TRIED IN VAIN TO MAKE SENSE OF THE TRIO'S FIGURES 
HOW MUCH PROFIT DO YOU MAKE AFTER EXPENDITURE 
SO FAR WE HAVEN'T CALCULATED THAT BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT WE HAVEN'T CALCULATED ALL OUR COSTS 
THAT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE TRUE YOU CANNOT BE THAT DAFT 
FINALLY THE DRAGONS ALL AGREED ON ONE THING 
THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE WORST PRESENTATIONS I'VE EVER HAD GIVEN TO ME 
I THINK YOU HAVE REALLY MESSED UP 
I'M LEFT CONFUSED AND EVER SO SLIGHTLY BORED 
AND DUNCAN BANNATYNE LEFT THE TRIO IN NO DOUBT WHERE THEY STOOD 
I DON'T LIKE THE PRODUCT I DON'T ACTUALLY LIKE YOU 
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU I'M NOT GONNA INVEST I'M OUT 
FACING THE DRAGONS NEXT ARE ENTREPRENEURS TONY CHARLES AND SHANE LAKE FROM WEST LONDON 
THEY'RE FLEDGLING COMPANY NEEDS CAPITAL TO GROW 
BUT CAN THEY CONVINCE OUR MULTI MILLIONAIRE INVESTORS 
TO PART WITH ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEIR OWN CASH 
HELLO 
I'M TONY CHARLES FROM HUNGRYHOUSECO.UK 
AND THIS IS MY BUSINESS PARTNER SHANE LAKE 
WE'RE ASKING FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN EXCHANGE FOR ELEVEN PER CENT EQUITY TO MAKE THIS 
A THING OF THE PAST 
HUNGRYHOUSE IS A WEBSITE THAT MAKES IT EASIER THAN EVER 
BEFORE TO FIND A TAKEAWAY RESTAURANT AND ORDER A DELIVERY 
WHEN YOU PUT YOUR POSTCODE IN YOU GET A PERSONALISED DIRECTORY OF YOUR LOCAL TAKEAWAYS 
IT'S A BIT LIKE THE YELLOW PAGES BUT ALL THE MENUS ARE RIGHT THERE TOO 
AFTER YOU CLICK ON THE FOOD YOU WANT WE PASS THE ORDER TO THE RESTAURANT AND THEY DELIVER LIKE NORMAL 
WE CHARGE THE RESTAURANT A COMMISSION ON EACH ORDER 
DOMINOS PIZZA HAS PROVEN THAT PEOPLE ENJOY ORDERING TAKEAWAY THROUGH ELECTRONIC CHANNELS 
THEY NOW DELIVER ONE IN SEVEN PIZZAS THIS WAY 
OUR WEBSITE SPICES THINGS UP THOUGH BY ADDING CHOICE 
WE BRING A RANGE OF RESTAURANTS AND CUISINES TOGETHER WHERE THEY 
COMPETE FOR THE FIRST TIME ON QUALITY SERVICE AND VALUE 
THE HOME DELIVERED FOOD MARKET WAS WORTH TWELVE BILLION POUNDS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
AND WAS GROWING AT OVER SIX PER CENT 
A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE EXPANSION OF ONLINE TAKEAWAY 
AND IN THE U. S. THE MARKET LEADER GENERATED FOOD ORDERS LAST YEAR WORTH ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS 
IN OUR FIRST YEAR OF TRADING WITH LITTLE ONLINE ADVERTISING 
HUNGRYHOUSE ATTRACTED SEVEN THOUSAND CUSTOMERS WHO PLACED FIFTEEN THOUSAND ORDERS 
WE'VE GROWN EASILY TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY RESTAURANTS COVERING A THIRD OF LONDON 
TO FUEL EXPANSION AND TO USE OUR TIME TO MARKET ADVANTAGE 
WE NEED FINANCE FOR RESTAURANT RECRUITMENT MARKETING AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING 
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS 
SHANE LAKE AND TONY CHARLES HAVE DELIVERED A PROFESSIONAL PITCH FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INVESTMENT IN HUNGRYHOUSE 
THEIR ONLINE SERVICE WHICH ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ORDER TAKEAWAY FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF RESTAURANTS 
JAMES CAAN WANTS TO DIG DEEPER INTO THEIR IMPRESSIVE SOUNDING FIGURES 
HELLO TONY HELLO SHANE I'M JAMES CAAN HI JAMES 
HI JAMES GOOD PRESENTATION 
COUPLE OF FINANCIAL QUESTIONS 
JUST GIVE ME A BIT OF AN IDEA ON THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND ORDERS YOU'VE TAKEN SO FAR 
WHAT'S THE FINANCIAL MODEL AROUND THAT 
WELL WE CHARGE A COMMISSION ON EACH ORDER THAT WE SEND 
SO WHAT IS THE COMMISSION AND WHAT HAS IT GENERATED WITH THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND ORDERS 
WE'RE CHARGING RESTAURANTS NINE PER CENT 
O. K. SO THOSE ORDERS AT NINE PER CENT EQUATES TO HOW MUCH 
WELL THIS YEAR WE'VE TURNED OVER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND 
AND WHAT'S YOUR PROJECTION GOING FORWARD 
WELL OUR PROJECTION IS TURNOVER FOR YEAR ONE WE'RE LOOKING AT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
M. M. M. H. M. M. EXPENSES OF THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT EXPENSES OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
TURNOVER IN YEAR TWO WILL BE TWO MILLION WITH EXPENDITURE OF ONE MILLION 
AND YEAR THREE TURNOVER WILL BE THIRTY TWO MILLION 
WITH NET PROFIT OF TWO MILLION O. K. 
IT'S A CALM AND ASSURED RESPONSE FROM SHANE AND TONY 
BUT ONE DRAGON IS NOT BOWLED OVER BY THEIR SLICK PRESENTATION SKILLS 
GUYS HI I'M PETER HI PETER HI PETER 
WHY WOULDN'T I DO THIS MYSELF 
IF I WANNA GO AND SPEND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF 
MY MONEY OR ANYBODY ELSE'S MONEY WHY DO I NEED YOU 
WELL THE VALUE ON THE BUSINESS IS THE SYSTEM DESIGN CODING WEBSITE 
THERE'S NO VALUE THERE 
WELL IT'S REALLY THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO PRODUCE SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO 
YEAH WE COULD DO VERY QUICKLY I DON'T THINK SO 
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK HERE 
WHAT IS THERE SPECIAL ON YOUR SITE THAT A TEAM OF 
I'VE GOT FORTY DEVELOPERS FULL TIME 
HOW QUICKLY DO YOU THINK I COULD REPLICATE THAT SITE 
QUITE QUICKLY BUT OUR UNIQUE 
SO WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR WHAT'S YOUR UNIQUE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE 
WELL OUR FOCUS IS ON BUILDING A COMMUNITY OF CUSTOMERS 
THAT'S NOT A UNIQUE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE COS THAT NOW MEANS I'LL EMPLOY TWO OR THREE 
GOOD SALESPEOPLE TO GO DOOR KNOCKING FOR ME AND OPEN UP SOME RESTAURANTS AND GET THEIR BUY IN 
I CAN DO THAT MYSELF THAT'S THE REASON WHY I'M OUT 
O. K. THANK YOU O. K. 
GUYS PETER'S RIGHT YOU'VE GOT NOTHING UNIQUE AND I'M NOT ACTUALLY CONVINCED 
I THINK WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK IS I FANCY A CHINESE TONIGHT OR I FANCY AN INDIAN TONIGHT OR I FANCY A. 
I DON'T THINK YOU GO ONTO A WEBSITE AND THINK WHAT DO I WANT TO EAT TONIGHT 
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S PEOPLE'S THOUGHT PROCESSES SO I'M OUT 
TWO DRAGONS OUT 
IT'S AN UNEXPECTED AND EARLY DISASTER FOR SHANE AND TONY 
THE BUSINESSMEN ARE SUDDENLY STRUGGLING TO CONVINCE THE REMAINING MULTI MILLIONAIRES TO INVEST 
AND THEO PAPHITIS IS ABOUT TO MAKE THINGS EVEN MORE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE DUO 
SHANE TONY I'M THEO HI THEO HI THEO 
FIRST OF ALL WHO ELSE IS DOING THIS IN THE U. K. 
AT THE MOMENT IF YOU WANNA ORDER A TAKEAWAY ONLINE YOUR OPTIONS ARE VERY LIMITED 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT AND OUR PRODUCT IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE MARKET 
EXCEPT WE LAUNCHED IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND SIX A MONTH AFTERWARDS 
A COMPETITOR FROM DENMARK LAUNCHED 
AND THEY'VE GOT ABOUT FOUR TIMES AS MANY RESTAURANTS AS US AT THE MOMENT 
BUT THEIR PRODUCT WAS DEVELOPED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA 
YOU LAUNCHED WHEN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND SIX 
AND THEY LAUNCHED MARCH MARCH 
AND THEY'VE GOT FOUR TIMES THE RESTAURANTS YES 
THEY HAD A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IN DENMARK 
NO THEIR RESTAURANTS ARE IN DENMARK NO I'M WITH ENGLAND NOW 
SO THEY'VE HAD TO GO AND DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE HAD TO GO AND DO AND THAT IS RECRUIT RESTAURANTS 
YEAH 
SO THEY'RE PRETTY WELL ADVANCED THEY ARE 
O. K. 
SHANE AND TONY'S PITCH IS STARTING TO CRUMBLE 
GOING HEAD TO HEAD WITH A RIVAL WITH FOUR TIMES AS 
MANY RESTAURANTS ON THEIR BOOKS IS AN EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS PLAN 
NOW JAMES CAAN IS KEEN TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE COMPETITOR 
HOW WELL HAVE YOU BEEN TRACKING YOUR COMPETITOR THAT'S GOT FOUR TIMES MORE SITES THAN YOU'VE GOT 
VERY WELL YEAH 
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO THEY HAVE OUT THERE MARKETING DO YOU KNOW THAT 
ABOUT FOUR SALES EXECUTIVES 
THERE MIGHT BE AS MANY AS FIVE OR SIX NOW THAT HAVE GONE INTO OTHER PARTS OF THE U. K. 
AND WHAT'S YOUR GUT FEELING WITH THEIR VOLUME WHAT ARE THEY DOING 
WE CAN TELL YOU WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN DENMARK 
NO I WANNA KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING HERE 
I'M INTERESTED IN DENMARK SO LET'S DO DENMARK 
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ORDERS A MONTH 
O. K. WHAT DOES THAT CONVERT INTO REVENUE IN YOUR OPINION 
WHAT ARE THEY GENERATING ON THAT 
VERY ROUGHLY YOU COULD JUST TAKE TEN PER CENT OF THAT 
SORRY TIMES BY FIFTEEN AVERAGE ORDER 
YEAH THEN DIVIDE BY TEN 
SO THAT'S THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
ONE POINT FIVE OH IN WHAT IS IT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
IT'S HALF A MILLION POUND A MONTH 
THAT'S GOOD MONEY SIX MILLION A YEAR 
FAR FROM BEING ALIENATED BY THE SUCCESS OF THE RIVAL COMPANY JAMES CAAN IS IMPRESSED BY 
THE PROFITABILITY OF THIS BUSINESS MODEL AND HE'S READY TO DECLARE WHERE HE STANDS 
LET ME START THE PROCESS GENTLEMEN 
I ACTUALLY DO LIKE THE CONCEPT 
I THINK AS A BUSINESS RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S QUITE FLEDGLING 
SO I THINK WHAT I WOULD BE INTERESTING IN DOING IS 
I'LL PROBABLY GO IN WITH FIFTY THOUSAND BUT I THINK I'D WANT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE EQUITY 
THANK YOU 
SHANE AND TONY HAVE SECURED AN OFFER FOR HALF OF THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THEY NEED 
BUT WITH ONLY TWO OTHER DRAGONS STILL IN THEY'LL NEED AT LEAST ONE 
TO SHARE JAMES CAAN'S FAITH IN THE BUSINESS CONCEPT OR THEY'LL LEAVE THE DEN WITH NOTHING 
I CAN TELL YOU WHERE I AM NOW 
THE RISKS IN YOUR BUSINESS ARE QUITE HUGE 
YOU HAVE GOT A VERY STRONG COMPETITOR THAT'S OUT THERE DOING 
THE BUSINESS A LOT QUICKER THAN YOU AND ARE TAKING SOME OF THE MARKET 
AND THERE'S NO BARRIERS TO MARKET 
A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE CAN DO THIS ALLS YOU NEED IS CASH AND SOME NOUS 
AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH NOUS AND CASH 
WHEN I TAKE ALL THOSE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT 
FOR ME TO INVEST IN THIS BUSINESS I'M GONNA WANT A HELL OF A LOT OF EQUITY 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IF WE GOT TO THAT STAGE ONE THINK YOU'D LOSE YOUR ENTHUSIASM 
IT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT 
YES RIGHT 
PURELY FOR THOSE REASONS I'M OUT 
THEO PAPHITIS CAN'T SEE A WAY OF MAKING THE DEAL WORK AND IS THE THIRD DRAGON OUT 
ALL THAT NOW LIES BETWEEN THEM AND FAILURE IS DUNCAN BANNATYNE 
I CAN SEE THIS BUSINESS HAVING POSSIBLY POTENTIAL BUT IT IS VERY RISKY 
SO FOR THAT REASON 
THE ONLY WAY I COULD MAKE AN OFFER 
FOR THE OTHER HALF OF THE MONEY THAT YOU NEED 
IS TO AGREE WITH JAMES ON AN EQUITY LEVEL OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
SO YOU HAVE ACTUALLY AN OFFER FOR WHAT YOU ASKED FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR FIFTY PER CENT OF THE COMPANY 
SHANE AND TONY HAVE BEEN THROWN A LIFELINE 
THE OFFER FROM DUNCAN BANNATYNE AND JAMES CAAN ALLOWS THEM TO WALK AWAY WITH AN INVESTMENT 
BUT AT A STAGGERINGLY HIGH PRICE 
THE YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS WILL HAVE TO USE ALL THEIR NEGOTIATING SKILLS IF THEY'RE TO SECURE A BETTER DEAL 
WELL WE CAME IN HERE WITH A LIMIT OBVIOUSLY 
AND THAT'S CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THAT OFFER UNFORTUNATELY 
YOU WOULDN'T THINK ABOUT TEN PER CENT EACH 
JUST GIVE ME YOUR NUMBERS AGAIN YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA DO 
WHAT WAS YOUR FORECAST FOR YEAR ONE 
YEAH FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND TURNOVER FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY YEAR TWO 
YEAR TWO WAS TWO MILLION 
YEAH YEAR THREE YEAR THREE IS THIRTY TWO 
THREE POINT TWO MILLION AND YOUR PROFIT IN YEAR ONE 
YEAR ONE WAS THIRTY K. THIRTY K. 
AND THEN ONE MILLION AND TWO MILLION 
O. K. 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M PREPARED TO DO 
IF YOU DELIVER YOUR BUSINESS PLAN O. K. I'M HAPPY TO DROP 
FROM TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IN YEAR ONE I'LL DROP TO TWENTY PER CENT IN YEAR TWO IF YOU DELIVER YOUR NUMBER 
AND I'M HAPPY TO DROP TO FIFTEEN PER CENT EQUITY 
IF YOU DELIVER YOUR YEAR THREE NUMBER 
SO IF YOU CAN DELIVER WHAT YOU SAY YOU CAN DELIVER 
I'M HAPPY TO TAKE A LOWER AMOUNT 
IF YOU CAN'T THEN I'M TAKING A HIGHER RISK THEREFORE I SHOULD GET A HIGHER AMOUNT 
YEAH I'D MATCH THAT YEAH 
AND THAT GIVES YOU BACK THE INCENTIVE AS THEO QUITE RIGHTLY SAID THAT YOU WOULD LOSE 
CAN WE HAVE A CHAT PLEASE 
YEAH O. K. 
TO GET THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INVESTMENT THEY NEED 
SHANE AND TONY STILL FACE GIVING UP FIFTY PER CENT OF THEIR BUSINESS 
BUT IF THEY HIT THE AMBITIOUS TARGETS 
THEY'VE SET THEMSELVES THE DRAGONS ARE PREPARED TO GIVE THEM TWENTY PER CENT BACK 
IT'S A TOUGH DECISION FOR THE PAIR 
I CAN'T MAKE THIS DECISION BECAUSE 
WELL ER AS TONY MENTIONED IT IS 
QUITE A LOT MORE THAN WHAT WE WERE WILLING TO RELINQUISH TODAY 
WE HAVE ABSOLUTE FAITH IN THE FIGURES AND THE BUSINESS OBVIOUSLY BEING HERE TODAY 
AND WE ALSO CAN SEE GREAT VALUE IN WHAT BOTH OF YOU CAN OFFER 
SO FOR THAT REASON 
WE'D LIKE TO ACCEPT YOUR OFFERS EXCELLENT 
WELL DONE WELL DONE 
IT'S BEEN A ROLLERCOASTER RIDE FOR SHANE AND TONY 
BUT THEY'RE LEAVING THE DEN WITH THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THEY CAME IN FOR 
AND WITH TWO NEW AND VERY EXPERIENCED BUSINESS PARTNERS 
SHANE TONY 
THAT WAS QUITE A DILEMMA FOR YOU I THINK WASN'T IT 
YEAH IT WAS A BIG DILEMMA 
I HAD TO TWIST TONY'S ARM SO I SAID THAT HE'LL LOOK BACK AND THANK ME FOR IT 
ARE YOU STILL ENTHUSED I AM YEAH IT'S JUST A SHOCK ARE YOU SURE 
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT 
IT'S A SHOCK BECAUSE WE OBVIOUSLY HAD DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS AND 
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE GONNA WORK VERY HARD AND MAKE 
MAKE THE DRAGONS WORK HARD AS WELL 
WE EXPECT TO USE AS MUCH OF THEIR RESOURCES AS WE POSSIBLY CAN 
WE'VE SEEN AGAIN THE DRAGONS CERTAINLY LIKE TO TAKE THEIR FAIR 
SHARE OF EQUITY BUT THAT DOES HAVE A BIG UPSIDE FOR AN ENTREPRENEUR 
WHEN THE DRAGONS TAKE A CHUNK OF YOUR COMPANY 
YOU CAN BE SURE YOU'LL GET A CHUNK OF THEIR TIME AND ATTENTION 
IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT ANY OF THE DRAGONS 
OR SEE WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND THE SCENES GO TO 
GOODBYE 
NEXT TIME ON DRAGONS' DEN 
THEO PAPHITIS MAKES HIS FEELINGS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR 
THIS INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY IS AS INVITING 
AS A TWO WEEK HOLIDAY IN AFGHANISTAN 
AND DEBORAH MEADEN LOSES HER PATIENCE WITH ONE INVENTOR 
YOU'VE LEFT ME WITH A RIGHT OLD DILEMMA 
I DON'T WANNA DRAG SOMEBODY KICKING AND SCREAMING 
DO YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING WITH IT OR NOT 
I'M A HARD WORKER AND I WILL GET THIS PRODUCT TO MARKET
