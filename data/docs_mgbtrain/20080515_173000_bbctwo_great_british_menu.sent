THE FIGHT GOES ON 
FOURTEEN OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP CHEFS ARE BATTLING FOR THE CHANCE 
TO PROVE THAT BRITAIN CAN PRODUCE FINE CUTTING EDGE COOKING 
THE WINNERS WILL SERVE UP A GLORIOUS BANQUET IN THE RESTAURANT 
AT THE SUMMIT OF THE ICONIC GHERKIN IN CENTRAL LONDON 
THE COOKING WILL HAVE TO BE SUPERB BECAUSE HOSTING THAT MEAL 
WILL BE OUR LEADING CULINARY TRAILBLAZER HESTON BLUMENTHAL AND HIS GUEST LIST 
WILL INCLUDE LEADING CHEFS AND GOURMETS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
WRESTLING FOR POSITION THIS WEEK TO REPRESENT LONDON 
AND THE SOUTH EAST IN OUR FINALS ARE ATUL KOCHHAR AND JASON ATHERTON 
I'M FIGHTING MY OWN CORNER AND I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THAT 
AND VERY COMFORTABLE 
I'M SURE HE'S GONNA BRING HIS A GAME TODAY SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO TURN IT UP A NOTCH 
THIS WEEK MICHELIN STARRED CHEFS JASON ATHERTON AND ATUL KOCHHAR 
ARE SPARRING FOR THE LONDON AND SOUTH EAST REGIONAL TITLE 
BOTH ARE INFLUENCED BY STYLES AND INGREDIENTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES 
BUT THEY'RE EMPHATIC THAT THEIR FOOD IS MODERN BRITISH 
THEIR METHODS MAY DIFFER BUT THEIR AIM IS THE SAME 
TO DESIGN THE ULTIMATE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FOUR COURSE MEAL 
EVERY DAY THEY'RE COOKING A DIFFERENT COURSE 
AND THEIR FULL MENUS WILL BE SCRUTINISED BY THE JUDGES TOMORROW 
THEIR EXACTING STANDARDS MEAN THAT ONLY THE BEST MODERN FOOD 
WILL MAKE IT THROUGH TO HESTON BLUMENTHAL'S GLITTERING BANQUET NEXT MONTH 
THE CHANCE TO COOK SOME OF THE WORLD'S FINEST CHEFS AND GOURMETS IS A POWERFUL MOTIVATION 
ATUL AND JASON ARE LIMBERING UP FOR THE PENULTIMATE ROUND OF THE FIGHT 
GOOD FRIENDS OUT OF THE KITCHEN 
TODAY THEY'LL COOK THEIR LAST COURSE BEFORE JUDGEMENT DAY 
AND IT'S TIME TO GET TOUGH 
IT'S JUST AN OBSTACLE IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE YOU CAN'T BE FRIENDS ALL THE TIME 
I'VE DEFINITELY COME HERE TO WIN 
IN THAT KITCHEN I'LL BE AS COMPETITIVE AS HE CAN BE 
THE CHEFS HAVE SET AN EXCEPTIONAL STANDARD WITH THE THREE COURSES THEY'VE MADE 
THEIR STARTERS COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFERENT 
ATUL CREATED A SPICY PEA SOUP AND MINI POPPADOMS OR POORI 
WHILE JASON PRODUCED AN ORIGINAL SANDWICH PLATE 
OF CROQUE MONSIEUR AND A MODERN GLASS OF B. L. T. 
DAY TWO'S FISH COURSE SAW BOTH CHEFS GOING FOR SALMON 
JASON'S SMOKED FISH SAT NEXT TO AN UNUSUAL HORSERADISH SNOW 
AND ATUL'S INDIAN BACKGROUND 
INSPIRED A FISH MADRAS WITH SEMOLINA POLENTA 
YESTERDAY WAS THE MAIN COURSE 
AND ATUL SERVED AYLESBURY DUCK BREAST WITH FOIE GRAS ICE CREAM 
JASON WENT FOR DEXTER BEEF FILLET 
AND PRESENTED IT WITH OXCHEEKS AND SMOKED POMME PUREE 
SO IT'S THREE COURSES DOWN AND ONLY ONE TO GO 
AS THE BATTLE OF THE DESSERTS BEGINS 
GOOD MORNING MORNING 
MORNING ATUL MORNING SIR SIR 
I LIKE IT WHAT'S COOKING 
TODAY I'M DOING ARCTIC ROLL ARCTIC ROLL 
YEAH I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THAT LATER 
WITH THIS AND A RASPBERRY SALAD 
I'VE GOT SOME BEAUTIFUL VANILLA FOR MY ICE CREAM 
AND THEN THIS IS GOING TO SHOCK YOU ATUL 
HAVE YOU GOT A CHAIR O. K. SHOW ME 
I'M USING A SARAWAK PEPPERCORN TO MAKE A JELLY VERY GOOD 
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TELL ME IF I'M USING ENOUGH BEING THE MASTER OF SPICE 
IT'S A TRIP BACK IN TIME 
AS JASON PUTS A MODERN TWIST ON THE SEVENTIES CLASSIC ARCTIC ROLL 
HE'S SERVING IT WITH A RASPBERRY SALAD AND IS USING 
SARAWAK PEPPERCORNS TO BRING A PIQUANCY TO HIS RASPBERRY JELLY 
AND HE'S BOLDLY TAKING ON ATUL AT HIS OWN GAME BY USING SPICES IN A DESSERT 
YOU'RE INSPIRED BY ME ARE YOU 
FOR THREE DAYS I'VE WATCHED YOU WITH YOUR LITTLE POTS OF SPICES I KNOW 
I'VE BEEN GOING TO SLEEP AT NIGHT DRIFTING OFF TO THESE EXOTIC LANDS 
AND I JUST THOUGHT I BETTER GET MY ACT TOGETHER AND GET SOME SPICE IN 
OR I'M GONNA TOTALLY GET MY ASS KICKED 
MY ONE'S SLIGHTLY SIMPLER THAN YOURS 
IT'S GREEN CARDOMOM AND LIME PANNA COTTA 
USING PROPER ENGLISH CREAM AND TOP IT OFF WITH STRAWBERRY JELLY 
REALLY REALLY COOL 
CREAM AND STRAWBERRIES SUMMERTIME THAT'S MY THING 
AND I'LL BE DOING A STRAWBERRY SORBET WITH THAT YEAH 
AND BAKING A SHORTBREAD BISCUIT 
AND A STRAWBERRY POWDER WITH DRIED STRAWBERRIES 
O. K. WITH DRIED STRAWBERRIES 
ATUL'S DESSERT IS A CARDOMOM AND LIME PANNA COTTA 
TOPPED WITH STRAWBERRY JELLY 
THERE ARE MORE STRAWBERRIES IN THE SORBET 
ON TOP OF HIS SHORTBREAD BISCUITS AND IN THE STRAWBERRY POWDER 
VERY SIMPLE COMPARED TO YOU 
IT SOUNDS VERY POSH IT'S NOT VERY SIMPLE ATUL NOT AT ALL 
DEHYDRATED STRAWBERRIES ARE NOT SIMPLE 
SO JASON THINKS HIS RIVAL'S DESSERT COULD BE COMPLICATED BUT ATUL'S CONFIDENT ABOUT ITS SIMPLICITY 
HE'S WORKED HARD ON HIS DESSERT 
AND HE'S DEFINITELY A CHEF WHO DOES HIS FOOD RESEARCH PROPERLY 
ATUL KOCHHAR HAS BEEN CHEF PATRON OF LONDON'S BENARES RESTAURANT AND BAR FOR FIVE YEARS 
HIS BRITISH INDIAN EATERY IS HIGHLY RESPECTED FOR ITS ORIGINALITY 
AND DETERMINED TO STAY AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME 
ATUL REGULARLY CHECKS OUT ANY POSSIBLE COMPETITION 
WHEN I WALK INTO ANY RESTAURANT MY EXPERIENCE STARTS FROM THE MOMENT I STEP IN 
HOW IT'S BEEN DECORED HOW THE TABLES ARE LAID OUT 
WHAT SORT OF CROCKERY THEY HAVE 
BUT THE MAIN IMPORTANT THING COMES WHEN THE FOOD STARTS COMING OUT 
FANTASTIC WHAT SORT OF LAMB SHANK IS THIS IT'S FROM THE LUCKNOW REGION WOW IT'S SUPER 
I LIKE TO LEARN HOW THEY ARE USING SPICES 
I MIGHT SAUTE SPICES IN ONE WAY 
BUT THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO BRING FLAVOUR OUT BY STEAMING THEM OR BOILING THEM IN THE SAUCE 
AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I COME OUT AND LEARN MORE 
AFTER YEARS OF SEEING HOW OTHER PEOPLE DO IT AND SUCCESSFULLY 
RUNNING HIS OWN BUSINESS HE'S RECENTLY DECIDED TO BRANCH OUT AND OPEN ANOTHER VENUE 
BUT THIS TIME IT'S NOT IN MAYFAIR 
HE'S SET HIS HEART ON A PLACE IN THE HAMPSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE 
SURROUNDED BY AN AWARD WINNING VINEYARD 
TODAY HE'S BROUGHT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN TO LOOK AROUND THE NEW VENTURE BATTICA 
THE HAMPSHIRE RESTAURANT WILL MARK A SHIFT TO BE HONEST IN A LOT OF WAYS 
I'LL BE ABLE TO USE THE LOCAL FARMER 
WHO WILL GROW VEGETABLES FOR ME JUST ACROSS THE STREET 
THE BEEF FARMER IS JUST DOWN THE ROAD THE POULTRY FARMER IS JUST BEHIND US 
SO EVERYTHING IS ABSOLUTELY LOCAL FOR ME 
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO GET THERE 
THIS IS THE RESTAURANT INSIDE 
ATUL WILL SOON BE ENTERTAINING A DIFFERENT CLIENTELE 
BUT WILL HE ADOPT A NEW STYLE OR STAY TRUE TO HIS ROOTS 
I WAS BORN IN INDIA AND MY CHILDREN ARE BORN HERE IN THIS COUNTRY 
SO WE ARE A BRITISH INDIAN FAMILY AND THAT'S THE KIND OF FOOD I COOK 
I'M HOPING BY DOING THIS RESTAURANT IT WILL BE SOMETHING WHICH 
MY CHILDREN WILL APPRECIATE AND GROW WITH IT AND UNDERSTAND WHAT BRITISH INDIAN VALUES MEAN 
BACK IN OUR KITCHEN 
THE CHEFS ARE WELL UNDER WAY WITH THEIR DESSERT COURSES 
COMPETITION VETERAN ATUL HAS WON THE REGIONAL TITLE 
FOR TWO YEARS IN A ROW NOW BUT IT'S NOT GETTING ANY EASIER 
THIS IS THE TOUGHEST IN WHAT SENSE COMPETING AGAINST YOU IS NOT EASY MATE COME ON 
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO IS STANDING HERE IF ANYBODY ELSE WERE HERE 
THEY'D HAVE RUN AWAY BEFORE THE COMPETITION YOU'RE SO GOOD 
THAT'S NOT TRUE IT'S TRUE 
YOU'RE JUST FLATTERING ME I'M NOT 
JASON'S PLAYING THE MODESTY CARD 
BUT ATUL HAS EVERY REASON TO PRAISE HIS OPPONENT 
JASON ATHERTON IS THE EXECUTIVE CHEF 
OF THE MODERN BRITISH TAPAS RESTAURANT MAZE IN LONDON 
HE HAS CONSIDERABLE INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND IS UNDOUBTEDLY DEVOTED TO THE JOB 
I'M VERY DRIVEN AS A CHEF NO TWO WAYS ABOUT THAT 
FOR ME IT'S MY LIFE IT'S WHAT I DO 
I LIVE BREATHE EAT SLEEP FOOD 
AND I THINK IT SHOWS IN EVERYTHING I DO 
HIS BOSS GORDON RAMSAY NOTICED JASON'S POTENTIAL EARLY 
THE FIRST REAL QUALITY I ADMIRED OF JASON ATHERTON WAS HIS DRIVE TO SUCCEED 
JASON'S DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS 
MORE THAN ANY OTHER CHEF I KNOW HE'S IN A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN 
UNIQUE VERY STUBBORN IN TERMS OF THAT LEVEL OF FOCUS 
AND UNAFFECTED BY HIS POPULARITY 
WHEN HE'S NOT IN THE U. K. WORKAHOLIC JASON OVERSEES MAZE'S SISTER RESTAURANTS IN NEW YORK AND PRAGUE 
AND WHILE THIS MAY LOOK LIKE A BUILDING SITE 
IT'S GOING TO BE JASON AND GORDON'S NEW LONDON RESTAURANT MAZE GRILL 
WITH HIS FULL ON DEDICATION TO WORK HE HAS TO SQUEEZE TIME FOR HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER INTO A TIGHT SCHEDULE 
MY FAMILY IS OBVIOUSLY A BIG PART OF MY LIFE BECAUSE THEY PLAY 
SECOND FIDDLE ALMOST IN A WORK SENSE TO MY WORK 
SO IT'S TERRIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME FOR MY FAMILY 
TO BE PASSIONATE ABOUT FOOD BECAUSE IT'S MY LIFE IT'S WHAT I LIVE FOR 
AND EVEN AT HOME HE'S STILL TAKING ON NEW CULINARY INFLUENCES 
MY WIFE IS FROM THE PHILIPPINES SO WE COOK AND EAT A LOT OF ASIAN FOOD 
NOT JUST FROM THE PHILIPPINES BUT ALL SOUTHEAST ASIAN FOOD 
WHICH IS REALLY VIBRANT FRESH INGREDIENTS 
SHE'S OPENED MY EYES TO THAT PART OF THE WORLD 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN THE CHEFS ARE PUTTING 
ALL THEIR SKILL AND ENERGY INTO THEIR DESSERT COURSES 
IT'S THEIR LAST CHANCE TO PERFECT THE DISHES BEFORE JUDGEMENT DAY TOMORROW 
JASON'S RASPBERRY JELLY INFUSED WITH SARAWAK PEPPER IS BEING REDUCED 
AND NOW HE'S TACKLING THE ICE CREAM FOR HIS ARCTIC ROLL 
HE'S COMBINING DOUBLE CREAM AND MILK WITH VANILLA 
ON THE OTHER SIDE 
ATUL STARTS OFF HIS PANNA COTTA WITH A MIXTURE OF CREAM AND CASTOR SUGAR 
HE'S ALREADY GROUND HIS GREEN CARDOMOM PODS AND HIS OPPONENT'S INTRIGUED 
SO I TOASTED IT LIGHTLY THE CARDOMOM PODS 
WOW IT'S MUCH STRONGER 
YEAH IT IS ALL THE FLAVOUR JUST COMES OUT 
AND IT WORKS SO WELL WITH VANILLA 
ALMOST TOFFEE LIKE FEELING MM 
THAT'S REALLY GOOD 
AND YOU JUST INFUSE IT INTO THE MILK RIGHT 
INTO THE MILK STRAIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S IT THIS'LL JUST COOK TOGETHER AND I'LL ADD GELATINE TO IT 
JASON'S IMPRESSED 
HE KNOWS THAT ATUL'S DESSERT COULD BE SERIOUS COMPETITION 
HE RETURNS TO HIS OWN SIDE 
TO ADD EGG YOLKS TO THE VANILLA ICE CREAM BUT HIS MIND IS STILL ON ATUL'S PUD 
WHICH CREAM DO YOU USE NOW ATUL 
DO YOU PREFER ORGANIC OR NORMAL CREAM I PREFER ORGANIC 
I DO PREFER ORGANIC 
THE KIND OF PERSON I AM I'M A HOLISTIC PERSON I LIKE NICE THINGS YOU'RE ORGANIC YOURSELF ARE YOU 
I FIND ORGANIC CREAM TASTES BETTER IN MY OPINION 
ATUL KNOWS THAT THIS HEAT COULD BE VERY CLOSE AND THAT THE DESSERT COULD DECIDE IT 
SO BEFORE THE COMPETITION BEGAN HE SET OUT IN SEARCH OF EXPERT ADVICE 
HIS PANNA COTTA IS AN ITALIAN INSPIRED DESSERT 
BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE TO JET OUT TO ROME OR MILAN 
HE TOOK A TRIP TO KENSINGTON 
JUST THREE MILES FROM HIS LONDON RESTAURANT 
HE WANTED TO GIVE HIS DESSERT A MODERN INTERPRETATION USING EXOTIC FLAVOURS 
SO HE WENT TO MEET A RENOWNED ITALIAN PUDDING MAKER 
I LOVE PANNA COTTA 
BECAUSE OF ITS DOUBLE CREAM CONTENT IT'S LOVELY GOOD FOR YOUR BODY ISN'T IT 
SO I DECIDED TO MAKE THAT FOR MY GREAT BRITISH MENU JUDGES 
AND OBVIOUSLY I NEED TO BEAT MY DEAR FRIEND 
ATUL HAD BROUGHT SOME DOUBLE CREAM WITH HIM 
BUT WAS LUCIANO PREPARED TO USE IT IN AN ITALIAN DESSERT 
SOME OF THE BEST ENGLISH CREAM 
YOU CAN GET IN THIS COUNTRY FROM JERSEY COWS I WOULD SAY 
IT'S ORGANIC IT'S DOUBLE CREAM IT'S FANTASTIC 
HAVE YOU COOKED WITH THIS CREAM BEFORE 
I USUALLY USE NORMAL DOUBLE CREAM FROM ITALY 
BUT I GUESS THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE BETTER 
ATUL FOUND CREAM THAT WAS NOT ONLY BRITISH BUT CAME FROM THE SOUTH EAST TOO FROM WILDEN IN BEDFORDSHIRE 
CROWHILL FARM HAS OVER THREE HUNDRED COWS AND THE DAIRY PRODUCES AN AVERAGE 
OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND LITRES OF MILK CREAM AND YOGHURT EVERY DAY 
THE QUALITY OF THE CREAM IS JUST OUT OF THIS WORLD 
I COULD NEVER BELIEVE I COULD GET SUCH A CREAM JUST A STONE'S THROW FROM LONDON 
SO I REALLY DON'T CARE WHAT JASON ATHERTON IS COOKING FOR HIS DESSERT 
I KNOW THIS CREAM IS A WINNER 
IN LUCIANO'S KITCHEN THE DOUBLE CREAM WAS HEATED WITH MILK GELATINE AND CASTOR SUGAR 
THE CREAM LOOKS AMAZING TO ME 
LUCIANO AGREED AND HAVING PUT THE COOLED MIXTURE INTO THE FRIDGE 
FOR TWO HOURS INVITED ATUL TO TASTE SOME OF HIS OWN CONFECTIONS 
SAFFRON SAFFRON FROM ITALIA 
THIS IS REALLY NICE 
I LOVE THIS ONE THIS IS FANTASTIC 
THAT'S MY FAVOURITE 
BUT HE WANTED TO CREATE HIS OWN MODERN INTERPRETATION OF PANNA COTTA FOR GREAT BRITISH MENU 
IT HAS GOT MY MIND GOING I NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT FLAVOURS TO ADD TO IT 
SAFFRON I THINK WAS THE CATALYST 
I'M THINKING OF BLACK CARDOMOM MAYBE GREEN CARDOMOM 
MAYBE WHITE CARDOMOM I DON'T KNOW 
I'LL GO BACK AND THINK ABOUT IT BEFORE I SUBMIT MY RECIPES BUT PANNA COTTA IS ON MY MENU 
AND HIS OF COURSE WILL BE MADE WITH ENGLISH DOUBLE CREAM 
THE BATCH THEY'D MADE EARLIER WAS READY TO TASTE 
THIS IS PERFECT LUCIANO THIS IS PERFECT PERFECT FOR ME 
PERFECT BRITISH CREAM 
ITALIAN RECIPE 
INDIAN MAN MAKING IT 
WHERE ELSE YOU CAN GET THAT 
ONLY IN LONDON ONLY IN LONDON 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN BOTH DESSERT COURSES ARE PROCEEDING APACE 
AFTER MUCH THOUGHT ATUL HAS DECIDED ON A FLAVOURING OF LIME AND GREEN CARDAMOM 
A QUICK SPRINKLE OF LIME ZEST IS ALL IT NEEDS BEFORE IT GOES INTO THE FRIDGE 
THAT SOUNDS EASY BUT IT'S VERY RUNNY 
CAREFUL 
ONE LITTLE SLIP AND THEY'LL BE PANNA COTTA MIXTURE ALL OVER THE FLOOR 
PERFECT 
STILL TO COME ON GREAT BRITISH MENU ATUL REVEALS A SECRET 
IT'S TRUE IT'S NOT A RUMOUR IT'S A FACT 
BUT WHAT IS IT 
THE CHEFS GIVE THEIR HONEST OPINIONS AS THEY TASTE ONE ANOTHER'S' DISHES 
SO FAR EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE GOING TO PLAN WITH THE TWO VERY POSH PUDS 
ATUL'S AIMING TO IMPRESS 
WITH A CARDAMOM AND LIME PANNA COTTA 
STRAWBERRY SORBET AND SHORTBREAD BISCUITS 
THEY'LL BE YET MORE STRAWBERRIES IN A JELLY ON THE PANNA COTTA 
AND SPRINKLED ON THE BISCUITS 
I HAVE PICKED UP ON SUMMER AND I THOUGHT OF CREAM AND STRAWBERRIES THEY GO WELL TOGETHER 
JELLY YOU CAN'T LEAVE JELLY ESPECIALLY FOR BRITISH SUMMER 
I'VE USED ALL THOSE ELEMENTS 
JASON'S ALSO GOING FOR A DESSERT THAT'S MODERN BUT IN A RETRO WAY 
HE'S BRINGING ARCTIC ROLL BACK INTO FASHION 
ACCOMPANIED BY A RASPBERRY AND SARAWAK PEPPER JELLY 
IT'S FINISHED OFF WITH A PRETTY RASPBERRY SALAD 
BUT CAN THIS SEVENTIES CHILDREN'S CHOICE BE CLASSED AS A BRITISH CLASSIC 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IS A GREAT BRITISH DISH 
IT'S HAD A BIT OF A STIGMA ATTACHED TO IT WHERE IT'S ONLY BEEN USED 
AS SOMETHING YOU CAN GIVE TO THE KIDS TO KEEP THEM QUIET 
BUT I'M HERE TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT IT'S NOT LIKE THAT NOT AT ALL 
IT CAN BE A SERIOUS DESSERT 
HE'LL NEED TO EXECUTE IT PERFECTLY THOUGH 
HE ALREADY HAS HIS ICE CREAM CHURNING AND HIS SPONGE IS NEARLY READY 
BUT HE'S A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE JUDGES WILL REACT 
TO BEING SERVED WITH TWO DESSERTS THAT ARE BOTH BASED ON CREAM AND SUMMER FRUITS 
WILL THEY MAKE MUCH OF THIS BOTH USING THE SAME INGREDIENT 
NO I DON'T THINK SO THEY HAVE VERY CLEAN PALATE ALL OF THEM 
SEE THEY KNOW YOU ATUL SO YOU'RE THREE STEPS AHEAD OF ME 
YEAH IT'S EASY TO FALL DOWN FROM THERE 
I'M SO UP AGAINST IT IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
JASON ISN'T REALLY INTIMIDATED BUT ATUL'S EXPERIENCE MAY GIVE HIM A SLIGHT EDGE 
HE'S NOW ADDING LIQUID GLUCOSE TO HIS SORBET 
WHILE JASON WORKS ON THE JAM FOR HIS ARCTIC ROLL 
NOW I'D JUST OPEN THE CUPBOARD BUT HE WANTED SOMETHING SPECIAL 
SO HE WENT OUT TO FIND TOP QUALITY INGREDIENTS AND SOME HOT TIPS 
LONDON'S MARKETS ARE LIKE A TREASURE TROVE OF FRESH FRUIT SO THERE WAS PLENTY TO CHOOSE FROM 
AFTER SCOURING NEW COVENT GARDEN JASON SETTLED ON SOME JUICY RASPBERRIES 
BUT NEEDED HELP TO TURN THEM INTO TOP QUALITY JAM 
FRASER DOHERTY MAY ONLY BE EIGHTEEN BUT HE ALREADY RUNS HIS OWN SUCCESSFUL COMPANY 
HE'S ONE OF THE YOUNGEST BUSINESSMEN IN THE U. K. TO SUPPLY MAJOR SUPERMARKETS 
AND HAS EVEN RECEIVED A BUSINESS AWARD FROM GORDON BROWN 
JASON WAS KEEN TO SEE HOW HE APPROACHES JAM MAKING 
I'M MAKING ARCTIC ROLL REMEMBER THAT YEAH I LOVE ARCTIC ROLL 
I'M MAKING THAT AND I'M TAKING IT TO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
SHOW THESE JUDGES WHAT A GREAT BRITISH DESSERT CAN BE 
I TASTED YOUR JAM ABOUT A YEAR AGO NOW AROUND THE CORNER 
IT WAS REALLY REALLY DELICIOUS AND WHAT I REALLY LIKED ABOUT IT WAS IT WAS NOT OVER SWEET 
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A REALLY FRUITY TART TASTE NOW BECAUSE OF 
THE CRANBERRIES AND THE RASPBERRIES SO I THINK IT'LL WORK REALLY WELL 
THE RECIPE WHERE'S IT FROM 
MY GRAN TAUGHT ME HOW TO MAKE JAM WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN AND I STARTED DOING IT AS A HOBBY 
I LIKED MAKING JAM AND DEVELOPED THE IDEA OF MAKING JAM COMPLETELY FROM A FRUIT AND FRUIT JUICE 
OVER A FEW YEARS AND SOME SUPERMARKETS HAVE TAKEN IT ON 
THE FIRST STAGE WAS TO HEAT UP SWEET GRAPE JUICE UNTIL IT BUBBLED FURIOUSLY 
WHAT DENSITY ARE WE LOOKING FOR 
QUITE A SYRUPY DENSITY SO ABOUT A QUARTER OF ITS ORIGINAL VOLUME 
RIGHT QUARTER OF ITS VOLUME 
FRASER SUGGESTED THAT THEY ALSO PUT IN ONE OF HIS SECRET INGREDIENTS 
I'VE NEVER USED CRANBERRIES IN RASPBERRY JAM ESPECIALLY FOR ARCTIC ROLLS 
FOR ME IT'S A BIT OF A NEW INVENTION 
HE HAD ONE MORE THING TO ADD 
I'M GONNA PUT SOME OF THE RASPBERRIES INTO THIS PAN 
YOU COOKING THEM DOWN OR JUST HEATING THEM UP 
COOKING THEM DOWN TILL THEY'RE THE CONSISTENCY OF PORRIDGE O. K. IS THAT YOUR NAN'S TRADITIONAL YEAH 
SO FAR SO GOOD 
BUT SETTING JAM'S THE TRICKY BIT THAT'S ALL ABOUT TEMPERATURE 
I'LL BOIL IT UP TO THE SETTING POINT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIVE DEGREES 
RIGHT AND THEN THAT WILL HOPEFULLY SET RIGHT WE CAN TRY 
IT COOLS AND GELS QUICKLY ON A COLD PLATE 
WOW LOOK AT THAT ABSOLUTELY AMAZING TO LOOK AT 
THE SHINE ON THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR GREAT 
FINGER THROUGH YEAH O. K. LET'S TASTE IT 
WOW THAT'S SO GOOD IT LOOKS REALLY LIKE A CLASSIC JAM IT LOOKS GREAT 
BRILLIANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN JASON HAS DECIDED ON HIS OWN SECRET FLAVOURING 
ADDING LEMON THYME TO A CONCENTRATED RASPBERRY JAM BASE 
THE WAY IT NEEDS TO LOOK IT NEEDS TO HAVE A DENSE LAYER 
AROUND THE OUTSIDE FOR THE ICE CREAM WILL IT BE READY IN TIME 
ATUL I'M ALWAYS ON TIME 
NOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE TEMPTING FATE 
ATUL NEEDS TO CONCENTRATE ON THE NEXT STAGE OF HIS DESSERT 
A LAYER OF STRAWBERRY JELLY ON TOP OF HIS NOW SET PANNA COTTA 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN JASON'S SPREADING THE SPONGE MIXTURE FOR HIS ARCTIC ROLL 
BUT HE'S WORRIED THAT ALL HIS EFFORTS TODAY WILL BE WASTED ON HIS RIVAL 
ATUL I'VE HEARD A RUMOUR THAT YOU DON'T LIKE EATING DESSERTS 
IS THAT TRUE 
IT'S TRUE IT'S NOT A RUMOUR IT'S A FACT 
HOW ARE YOU GONNA CRITIQUE MY DESSERT IF YOU DON'T LIKE DESSERTS 
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM MATE 
HUH THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM 
IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM I LOVE DESSERTS 
I'LL GIVE YOURS A FAIR CRACK OF THE WHIP 
COURSE IT MATTERS IT MATTERS TO ME ATUL 
SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE FRIEND 
BUT IF ATUL DOESN'T LIKE DESSERTS 
HE'D FIND IT HARD TO COMMENT ON ONE HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 
WHAT'S BRITISH ABOUT ARCTIC ROLL THEN 
THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD THEY SERVE IT IT'S NOT LIKE 
NOT EVEN IN THE ARCTIC 
NO NOT IN THE ARCTIC NO 
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT ATUL IT IS VERY TRADITIONAL BRITISH 
AND IT'S MORE TRADITIONAL THAN PANNA COTTA NO 
I AGREE I NEVER ARGUED THAT 
BUT PANNA COTTA IS STILL VERY BRITISH 
ESPECIALLY THE CARDAMOM AND LIME ONE 
WITH ATUL REVAMPING A TRADITIONAL ITALIAN DESSERT 
AND JASON ATTEMPTING TO OVERHAUL AN OLD BRITISH CLASSIC 
BOTH CHEFS MAY HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT CONVINCING THE JUDGES 
THAT THEIR DISHES REPRESENT OUR VERY BEST CONTEMPORARY DESSERTS 
WHAT DO YOU HATE ABOUT MODERN BRITISH 
TO HAVE A CUISINE WHICH HAS TURNED INTO MODERN BRITISH 
YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT HOW LONG THE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN 
WHERE IT HAS COME FROM 
THERE HAS TO BE SOME CREDIBILITY 
YOU CANNOT HAVE A RESTAURANT FROM MARS OPENING IN LONDON AND SAYING 
THIS IS A MODERN BRITISH COOKING YEAH 
OH REALLY THE JUDGES WILL DEFINITELY BE LOOKING FOR FOOD 
THAT'S OUT OF THIS WORLD TOMORROW WHEN ATUL AND JASON PRESENT ALL FOUR OF THEIR DISHES 
BUT THEY HAVEN'T FINISHED THIS ONE YET 
AND WITH ALL THE ELEMENTS OF HIS ARCTIC ROLL READY 
JASON QUICKLY ASSEMBLES HIS CLASSIC DESSERT 
IT'S A REVELATION TO ATUL 
I HAD NO CLUE HOW IT WOULD BE 
MAYBE IT'S LIKE A SWISS ROLL OR I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT 
WHEN YOU SAID ARCTIC ROLL I THOUGHT THERE WILL BE SOME ICE CREAM AS THE NAME SUGGESTS 
THAT'S ALL I COULD THINK OF BUT IT'S FASCINATING 
ALL YOU DO IS SORT OF ROLL IT UP 
AND WHAT YOU HAVE THERE IS A QUINTESSENTIAL 
ARCTIC ROLL 
ENGLISH ARCTIC ROLL SUPER ARCTIC 
JASON'S NEARLY FINISHED AND ALL ATUL HAS TO DO IS CHECK HIS SORBET 
LOOK AT THAT THAT'S PROPER SORBET 
ALL RIGHT ATUL 
YEAH YEAH GO ON WE'RE GOING MATE 
TIME TO PLATE UP AND JASON CAREFULLY DECORATES HIS PLATE WITH FRUITS 
AND THEN PORTIONS OUT HIS RASPBERRY AND SARAWAK PEPPER JELLY 
THE ARCTIC ROLLS NOW GET A GENEROUS COATING OF VANILLA SUGAR 
ATUL CAREFULLY PLACES THE CARDAMOM AND LIME PANNA COTTA 
QUICKLY HEATS THROUGH SOME STRAWBERRIES WITH BALSAMIC VINEGAR 
AND BLACK PEPPER AND PUTS THEM ON HIS SHORTBREAD BISCUITS 
HE COMPLETES THE DISH WITH A DUSTING OF DEHYDRATED STRAWBERRIES 
AND A SMOOTH STRAWBERRY SORBET 
BEAUTIFUL WELL A BIT OF SUMMER ON THE PLATE I GUESS YUP 
BUT YOUR'S IS GORGEOUS 
AND THAT'S THE DESSERT COURSES FOR LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST DONE 
ATUL'S PANNA COTTA TOPPED WITH STRAWBERRY JELLY SERVED WITH STRAWBERRY SORBET 
AND THERE'S JASON'S MODERN TRIBUTE TO THE SEVENTIES 
ARCTIC ROLL WITH RASPBERRY AND PEPPER JELLY 
THEY BOTH LOOK GREAT BUT HOW DO THEY TASTE 
ATUL TRIES HIS PANNA COTTA IN THE KITCHEN 
PERFECT I LOVE IT 
WHILE JASON TAKES HIS PLATE INTO ANOTHER ROOM TO GIVE HIS HONEST OPINION 
YEAH IT LOOKS PRETTY WORTH THE WAIT 
BUT YOU KNOW IT'S ALL DOWN IN THE EATING 
SO WHAT DOES THE MAN WHO DOESN'T EAT PUDDINGS THINK OF HIS OWN DESSERT 
IT'S FINE I'M QUITE HAPPY THE WAY IT IS 
IT'S SIMPLISTIC IT'S NICE AND IT'S TASTY 
HE'S MODESTY PERSONIFIED PERHAPS JASON WILL HAVE A BIT MORE TO SAY 
YOU CAN REALLY TASTE THE CARDAMOM 
THE IDEA OF TOASTING THEM REALLY WORKS 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT SOFTER 
IT SHOULD HAVE MORE GIVE ON IT THAN THAT 
I'D SERVE THE SHORTBREAD A BIT ON THE SIDE 
IT MAKES IT A BIT DIFFICULT TO EAT LIKE THAT 
THE SORBET'S MELTED TOO QUICKLY SO MAYBE SET THE SORBET A LITTLE BIT QUICKER 
SOMETHING OF A TECHNICAL DEMOLITION JOB THERE ANYTHING ELSE 
STILL CAN BE CATEGORISED AS MODERN BRITISH 
BUT IT'S ITALIAN AT THE END OF THE DAY SIMPLE AS THAT 
CLASSIC ITALIAN DESSERT 
SO IT'S NOT BRITISH ENOUGH FOR JASON 
NOTHING CAN DENT ATUL'S CONFIDENCE 
ANYTHING I PUT ON THE PLATE I THINK IT WILL BE THE WINNER OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T PUT IT DOWN 
JASON'S SURE THAT THIS WON'T BEAT HIS DISH 
ARCTIC ROLL AT LEAST IS A CLASSIC ENGLISH DESSERT 
AND I'M HOPING IT'S GONNA PUT A SMILE ON THE JUDGE'S FACES TOMORROW 
HE'S CONFIDENT BUT IT'S TIME TO CHANGE PLACES 
AND SEE WHAT THEY BOTH MAKE OF JASON'S DESSERT 
IT'S AS PRETTY AS A PAINTING IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL 
VERY NICELY DONE AND I'M IMPRESSED IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
SO UNQUALIFIED PRAISE FOR HIS RIVAL'S PRESENTATION 
IS JASON HAPPY WITH IT 
DESSERT SHOULD PUT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE AT THE END OF YOUR MEAL YEAH 
AFTER THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET THE BILL 
SO YOU WANT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE YEP 
BUT ATUL ISN'T SMILING 
I THINK HE KNOWS HE'S UP AGAINST IT 
VERY NICE JELLY 
ICE CREAM IS JUST RIGHT 
I WAS JUST WORRIED THAT IT MIGHT BE TOO FROZEN 
IT'S JUST RIGHT IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
IT'S REALLY WELL DONE VERY WELL EXECUTED 
I CAN'T TAKE ANY PUNCHES ON IT AND I'M VERY ANGRY ABOUT IT 
SO IS HE READY TO CONCEDE DEFEAT 
LOOKING AT THIS I THINK IT'S A GREAT DESSERT 
BUT I STILL PREFER MINE BECAUSE IT HAS GOT MORE FLAVOURS TO PLAY 
IT MAY NOT LOOK AS PRETTY AS THIS BUT MAKING PRETTY IS NOT DIFFICULT 
THIS DESSERT IS GOOD BUT IT DOESN'T WORRY ME 
TOMORROW IT'S JUDGMENT DAY AND BOTH CHEFS WILL COOK 
THEIR FULL FOUR COURSE MENU FOR THE JUDGES TO TASTE 
FOR THE MOST PART ATUL HAS CONCENTRATED ON FINESSING HIS MODERN BRITISH INDIAN DISHES 
WHILE JASON'S STRATEGY IS TO TAKE MORE RISKS AND HOPE THAT IT PAYS OFF 
BUT WHICH APPROACH IS GOING TO PREVAIL 
SOMEONE HERE HAS GONE FOR THE SAFETY GAME 
THE ONE BIT OF MODERNITY ON THIS DISH IS THE ONE THING I REALLY HATE 
HOW DO THE CHEFS FEEL AHEAD OF THE FINAL SHOWDOWN 
FINAL DAY IS BASICALLY YOUR JUDGEMENT DAY 
AND YOU HAVE TO PERFORM YOUR BEST 
EVERYTHING I DO IN LIFE I TAKE COMPLETELY SERIOUSLY 
AND MAKE SURE I GIVE IT MY ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT 
NO MATTER WHAT GOING ON AROUND ME 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TOMORROW BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE REAL PRESSURE
