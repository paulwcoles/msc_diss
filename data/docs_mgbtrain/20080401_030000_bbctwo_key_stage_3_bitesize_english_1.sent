WELCOME TO THE KEY STAGE THREE BITESIZE REVISION 
IF YOU ARE REVISING FOR YOUR ENGLISH TEST WE HAVE SOME UNITS 
TO HELP YOU TACKLE THE TEXTS YOU'LL BE ASKED QUESTIONS ON 
TOGETHER WITH LOTS OF TIPS ON HOW TO REVISE AND PLENTY OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO PRACTISE 
IN THE TEST YOU WILL NEED TO READ THREE TEXTS UNITED BY A COMMON THEME 
THESE TEXTS WILL COVER A RANGE OF STYLES 
LITERARY AND NON LITERARY 
IN THIS PROGRAMME WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT NON LITERARY TEXTS 
THESE ENGLISH REVISION PROGRAMMES ARE TARGETED AT STUDENTS WORKING AT LEVELS FOUR TO SEVEN 
THEY'VE BEEN DESIGNED IN BITESIZE CHUNKS AND AT THE START OF EACH UNIT YOU'LL SEE THIS MAIN MENU 
SO YOU CAN KEEP TRACK OF WHERE YOU ARE 
YOU CAN EITHER WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH THE PROGRAMME IN ORDER 
OR YOU CAN FAST FORWARD TO VIEW THE SECTION YOU NEED THE MOST HELP WITH 
WHEN YOU SEE THIS IT LETS YOU PAUSE AND HAVE A THINK MAKE NOTES AND TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS 
IF YOUR TESTS ARE LOOMING DON'T PANIC JUST GET ORGANISED 
HERE ARE SOME TIPS TO HELP YOU GET STARTED 
CREATE A REVISION SPACE 
SOMEWHERE QUIET AND COMFORTABLE 
LET EVERYONE KNOW YOU'D PREFER NOT TO BE DISTURBED 
OTHERWISE YOU'LL GIVE UP BEFORE YOU'VE STARTED 
EVERY THIRTY MINUTES OR SO CHANGE TOPIC OR SUBJECT 
TRY WORKING WITH A PARTNER OR SMALL GROUP TO TEST AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER 
BUT MAKE SURE YOU GET BACK TO YOUR REVISION AFTERWARDS 
IN THIS UNIT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE RANGE OF NON LITERARY TEXTS YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR 
FROM THESE TEN TEXTS CAN YOU TELL WHICH OF THEM ARE LITERARY 
AND WHICH ARE NON LITERARY 
HERE'S A CLUE THERE ARE FIVE OF EACH 
IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT WHEN YOU CAN SEE A LIST LIKE THIS 
BUT HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN NON LITERARY TEXTS TO OTHER PEOPLE 
THERE IS A WAY OF DEFINING IT WHICH IS VERY SIMPLE 
A NON LITERARY TEXT IS A PIECE OF WRITING THAT'S NOT A PRODUCT OF A PERSON'S IMAGINATION 
IT'S ABOUT 
SO WHY NOT JUST CALL IT FACTUAL WRITING 
WELL THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT EVERYTHING IN THE TEXT WAS A FACT 
AND IF WE LOOK AT THE PURPOSE OF THESE NON LITERARY TEXTS 
WE'LL SEE THAT THAT ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE 
WRITERS OFTEN MIX FACT AND OPINION 
SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO TELL IF SOMETHING IS BASED ON TRUE INFORMATION 
OR SOMEONE'S PARTICULAR POINT OF VIEW 
YOU NEED TO READ WITH A QUESTIONING MIND 
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE SAYS SOMETHING IS TRUE DOESN'T MEAN IT IS TRUE 
SO LET'S BE REMINDED OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FACT AND AN OPINION 
A FACT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CHECKED AND BACKED UP WITH EVIDENCE 
FOR EXAMPLE 
AN OPINION IS BASED ON A BELIEF OR VIEW SOMEONE THINKS 
IT IS NOT BASED ON EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE CHECKED 
FOR EXAMPLE 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE 
ARE THERE PLAYERS IN THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE WHO ARE BETTER THAN WAYNE ROONEY 
WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR TEST PAPER AND READING BOOKLET AND START READING THE PASSAGES 
YOU'LL BE ASKED ABOUT A VARIETY OF POINTS 
TO HELP YOU PREPARE IT'S BEST TO START WITH PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE 
IN NON LITERARY WRITING THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TEXT AND PURPOSE 
A RECIPE WOULD GIVE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COOK A DISH 
A TOURIST LEAFLET IS WRITTEN TO PERSUADE PEOPLE TO VISIT A PARTICULAR PLACE 
LEAGUE TABLES GIVE INFORMATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF TEAMS 
A HISTORY BOOK EXPLAINS HISTORICAL EVENTS 
AND FINALLY A MAGAZINE ARTICLE MAY ARGUE A POINT OF VIEW 
WE CAN'T ALWAYS CALL THIS FACTUAL WRITING 
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THEY ALL HAVE FACTUAL CONTENT 
TWO OF THESE EXAMPLES CONTAIN THE AUTHOR'S OPINION 
CAN YOU SEE WHICH ONES 
WHY NOT PAUSE THE PROGRAMME HERE AND WRITE DOWN YOUR THOUGHTS 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WHICH TWO CONTAIN THE AUTHOR'S OPINION 
IT'S THE TOURIST LEAFLET AND THE MAGAZINE ARTICLE 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE 
FOR EACH PIECE OF WRITING BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN UNDERSTAND 
SOME OF THE CHOICES AN AUTHOR MAKES ABOUT LAYOUT AND LANGUAGE 
LET'S LOOK AT AN EXAMPLE 
THIS AUTHOR WANTS PEOPLE TO VISIT HAMPTON COURT THAT'S THE PURPOSE 
IN ORDER TO DO THIS SHE OR HE HAS CHOSEN A LAYOUT AND LANGUAGE 
WHICH WILL APPEAL TO THE AUDIENCE 
THE LEAFLET NEEDS TO APPEAL TO THE YOUNG 
WHO MIGHT FEEL MUSEUMS ARE NOT FOR THEM AND PERSUADE THEM TO VISIT 
SO THE AUTHOR HAS USED COLOURFUL IMAGES 
AND HIGHLIGHTED ASPECTS OF THE MUSEUM WHICH WOULD APPEAL TO YOUNG PEOPLE 
THEN TO KEEP ATTENTION THE CONTENT HAS BEEN SPLIT INTO SMALL SECTIONS 
USING PICTURES AND DIRECT LANGUAGE 
IF THE AUTHOR TRIED TO USE THE SAME ILLUSTRATIONS AND LANGUAGE IN SAY A LEAGUE TABLE 
IT COULD BE VERY CONFUSING 
THE PURPOSE OF THE LEAGUE TABLE IS TO ALLOW THE READER TO SEE FACTS 
SO THE LAYOUT AND LANGUAGE ARE CLEAR AND MOST INFORMATION IS IN FIGURES 
NON LITERARY TEXTS CAN SOMETIMES HELP YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND ABOUT AN IMPORTANT ISSUE 
WE WANT TO KNOW 
WE WANT TO KNOW 
WE WANT TO KNOW 
HOW COME YOU'RE SUCH A FUSSY YOUNG MAN 
LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE LEAFLETS THEY RECEIVED 
THEY SOON NOTICED THAT DIFFERENT AUTHORS HAD DIFFERENT PURPOSES 
WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS LEAFLET 
IT DIDN'T REALLY APPEAL TO ME 
AS SOMETHING FOR MY TYPE OF AGE 
BECAUSE OF THE COMICAL PICTURES 
AND THE TEXT WAS HANDWRITING 
ONCE I DID ACTUALLY READ THROUGH IT 
I DID REALISE THAT IN ITS SIMPLE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN POWERFULLY 
JUST EAT IT JUST EAT IT OOH 
I THINK THAT THE LEAFLET IS AIMED AT SPECIFICALLY SCHOOL CHILDREN 
IT'S CLEVER BECAUSE IT SAYS ON THE FRONT 
SO YOU LOVE ANIMALS FOR SCHOOL DINNERS 
IT HAS PICTURES OF VERY SWEET LAMBS 
WHAT IT'S SAYING IS YOU'RE EATING THESE LAMBS FOR YOUR SCHOOL DINNER 
WHAT'S PURPOSEFULLY MISSED OUT 
IS THE GOOD SIDE OF THE WAY THAT THE ANIMALS ARE BRED AND TRANSPORTED 
AND IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT 
THAT THERE IS A LAW AGAINST KEEPING ANIMALS IN SUCH AN HORRIFIC WAY 
JUST EAT IT JUST EAT IT OOH 
THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF PAPER 
ONLY SHOWS THE GOOD AND NICE WAY THAT ANIMALS ARE PRODUCED AND KEPT 
I'M NOT SURE WHO WROTE IT 
BUT WHOEVER DID WRITE IT WANTS YOU TO EAT MEAT 
THE IMPRESSION THAT THE PHOTOGRAPH GIVES ME 
IS THAT THE PIGS ARE LIVING 
IN A VERY NICE HAPPY GLAMOROUS SORT OF ENVIRONMENTS 
A LOVELY GOLDEN COLOUR 
AND A LOT OF SPACE THAT THEY'RE LIVING IN 
IT COULD BE TRUE BUT I DOUBT IT 
I THINK THAT IT'S JUST THERE TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL GOOD ABOUT EATING MEAT 
JUST EAT IT JUST EAT IT OOH 
THE PURPOSE OF THIS NEWSPAPER 
IS THAT IT SAYS IT'S ALL RIGHT TO EAT MEAT 
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T EAT MEAT 
IT WOULDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES 
THEY CHOSE THESE PICTURES 
AS THEY ARE ALL HEALTHY PEOPLE IN SOMALIA 
AND THEY ARE ALL EATING 
AND THERE'S ONE OF LOADING FOOD STACKS 
AND THERE'S PLENTY OF GRAIN THERE'S STACKS OF THEM 
IF THEY HAD CHOSEN PEOPLE WHO WERE STARVING 
IT WOULD HAVE MADE YOU FEEL MORE GUILTY RATHER THAN LESS GUILTY 
JUST EAT IT JUST EAT IT OOH 
THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE I'VE BEEN READING IS TO TELL US 
THAT IF WE DIDN'T EAT MEAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY STARVING PEOPLE 
MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THIS BOOK 
WAS THAT IT'S GOOD FOR OLDER PEOPLE NOT A YOUNGER AGE GROUP 
THE PICTURES ARE GOOD THEY MAKE YOU WANT TO READ IT 
BECAUSE THEY ARE DISTURBING IT MAKES IT MORE INTERESTING 
I THOUGHT THE TEXT WAS DENSE 
AND VERY FACTUAL AND TO THE POINT 
THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL GUILTY ABOUT EATING BEEFBURGERS 
I DON'T THINK IT'LL WORK WITH MOST PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE ARE LIKE ME 
IT WOULDN'T BOTHER ME VERY MUCH 
ONCE YOU KNOW WHAT THE PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE ARE 
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THE CHOICES THE AUTHOR MADE ON LAYOUT AND LANGUAGE 
THE TEST PAPER WILL GIVE YOU SOME GUIDANCE ABOUT THE PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE 
HERE'S A PIECE OF WRITING ABOUT WOLVES 
IT SAYS 
THIS ONE IS FOR TOURISTS 
WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR READING BOOKLET 
AND START TO READ THE PASSAGES ASK YOURSELF THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS 
PERSUADE INFORM INSTRUCT THAT'S THE PURPOSE 
CHILDREN NEWCOMERS OLD PEOPLE THAT'S THE AUDIENCE 
LAYOUT AND STRUCTURE WHAT DO WE MEAN BY THAT 
LAYOUT IS THE DELIBERATE USE OF TECHNIQUES FOR GUIDING OR DIRECTING THE READER 
SUCH AS HEADINGS SUB HEADINGS 
BOLD TYPE DIFFERENT FONTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 
STRUCTURE IS THE LINE OF THOUGHT WHICH RUNS THROUGH THE WRITING THE PATH THROUGH THE TEXT 
USUALLY USING PARAGRAPHS AS THE STEPS 
FIRST LET'S GET TO GRIPS WITH LAYOUT 
LET'S TALK TO A WRITER WHO THINKS CAREFULLY ABOUT LAYOUT IN EVERY PIECE OF WORK SHE DOES 
MY NAME IS LISA SMOSARSKI I'M A STAFF WRITER ON BLISS MAGAZINE 
I'VE BEEN HERE ABOUT A YEAR NOW 
I DO VARIOUS SORT OF FEATURES 
THERE'S THE CELEB STUFF WE ALL LIKE REPORTS QUIZZES 
I LIVE IN LONDON AND I'M TWENTY TWO 
THE BLISS MAGAZINE AUDIENCE IS TEENAGE GIRLS AGED FOURTEEN TO EIGHTEEN 
SO WE TEND TO FOCUS OUR FEATURES TOWARDS THAT PARTICULAR AUDIENCE 
TOWARDS THOSE GIRLS' 
THIS IS A FEATURE ABOUT BODY IMAGE HENCE THE NAME BODY HELL 
BODY IMAGE IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO TEENAGE GIRLS 
AND OBVIOUSLY TO PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
EVERYONE IS UNHAPPY WITH THEIR BODY IN A CERTAIN WAY 
SO WE RAN A FEATURE THAT WOULD APPROACH THE FEARS AND CONCERNS OF OUR READERS 
THE FORMAT OF THIS IS OBVIOUSLY QUITE EYE CATCHING 
WE WANTED TO DRAW OUR READERS IN STRAIGHT AWAY 
SO THE HEADLINE DOES THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S TO DO WITH YOUR BODY 
AND IT NOT BEING A GOOD THING IT'S BAD IT'S HELL 
SO THEN YOUR EYE IS AUTOMATICALLY BROUGHT TO THE PICTURE 
AND WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL A STAND FIRST HERE 
THAT'S GOT TWO MEANINGS FIRST THAT THIS IS A FLIP BOOK 
BUT SECONDLY DO YOU FLIP OUT BECAUSE YOU THINK YOUR BODY ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN USE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES TO BREAK UP A LARGE BIT OF COPY 
WHEN YOU'RE READING YOUR MIND MIGHT START TO WANDER COS YOU'RE BOMBARDED WITH SO MUCH INFORMATION 
YOU CAN USE THE PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE TO BREAK IT UP AND MOVE THE MEANING ON 
BUT IN MAGAZINES WE USE CROSS HEADS 
WHICH ARE SMALL HEADLINES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FEATURE 
WHICH GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT'S TO COME 
WE USE BOX OUTS IN FEATURES QUITE A LOT THESE HAVE VARIOUS PURPOSES 
ONE OF THEM IS TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO DIP IN AND OUT OF 
SO THAT THE INFORMATION ISN'T JUST THROWN AT YOU IN A HEAVY WAY 
THEY'RE QUITE SIMPLE THEY'RE EASY ON THE EYE 
AND IN A MINUTE OR SO YOU'VE GOT FIVE REALLY GOOD TIPS ON HOW TO LOVE YOUR BODY 
IF YOU READ THAT FIRST IT MAY TEMPT YOU INTO READING MORE OF THE FEATURE SO THAT'S ONE OF THE PURPOSES 
THE SECOND BOX WE HAVE HERE IS AN INFORMATION BOX 
ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A PROBLEM 
THIS IS THE EDUCATION THE INFORMATION SIDE OF THE PIECE 
IF YOU'VE READ IT AND THINK YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR BODY IMAGE 
YOU HAVE GOT AN ADDRESS OR A NUMBER TO CONTACT TO GET HELP 
SO A MAGAZINE ARTICLE CAN USE LOTS OF DEVICES TO ATTRACT YOUR ATTENTION AND THEN KEEP YOU READING 
PICTURES READERS WILL LOOK AT A PICTURE BEFORE TEXT SO THIS CATCHES THE EYE 
CHUNKED PARAGRAPHS THESE BREAK UP THE TEXT 
AND MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE 
CROSS HEADS OR SMALL HEADLINES 
WHICH SIGNPOST YOU THROUGH THE TEXT 
AND BOX OUTS THESE CAN PROVIDE TIPS SIMPLE INFORMATION 
OR A SUMMARY 
WE'VE REFERRED TO LAYOUT AS THE DELIBERATE USE OF TECHNIQUES WHICH YOU CAN SEE ON THE PAGE 
BEFORE YOU READ ANY WORDS 
THIS WAS A PASSAGE THAT WAS SET FOR A PREVIOUS TEST 
IT'S ABOUT LOCH NESS AND THE WRITER IS TRYING TO PERSUADE TOURISTS 
TO GO AND EXPLORE THE MYSTERIES OF NESSIE 
IN A TEXT SUCH AS THIS THERE ARE NO SUB HEADINGS 
SO IT'S THE PARAGRAPHS THAT HOLD THE KEY TO THE STRUCTURE 
SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS TRY TO THINK OF A TITLE FOR EACH PARAGRAPH 
IN PARAGRAPH ONE 
THE AUTHOR GIVES US AN INVITING PICTURE OF URQUHART CASTLE 
THE IDEAL PLACE TO STAY NEAR LOCH NESS 
SO YOU GIVE IT A TITLE 
IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH SHE BROADENS THE PICTURE 
TO TELL US HOW MYSTERIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL THE LOCH ITSELF IS 
THIS COULD BE 
THEN THERE ARE THREE PARAGRAPHS ABOUT RECORDED SIGHTINGS OF NESSIE 
TO MAKE THE IDEA OF THE MONSTER MORE APPEALING 
THE NEXT THREE PARAGRAPHS LOOK AT THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE WHICH BALANCES OUT THE PERSONAL STORIES 
LASTLY WE HAVE THE AUTHOR'S PERSONAL OPINION IT'S LEFT ON A COME AND SEE FOR YOURSELF BASIS 
WHICH IS WHAT SHE HOPES THEY'LL DO 
SO REMEMBER YOU NEED TO THINK OF A TITLE FOR EACH PARAGRAPH 
THAT'S A REALLY USEFUL WAY OF UNDERSTANDING STRUCTURE 
AND IN TEST CONDITIONS YOU CAN DO THIS BY WRITING NOTES IN THE MARGINS 
OF THE PAPER YOU MIGHT NEED TO SKIM READ A PASSAGE MORE THAN ONCE 
BEFORE IT STARTS TO MAKE SENSE 
BUT ONCE YOU HAVE A GRASP OF THE STRUCTURE YOU'LL SEE WHAT THE LINE OF THOUGHT IN THE PASSAGE IS 
SO REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE READING THROUGH THE NON LITERARY TEXTS 
IN YOUR TEST PAPER LOOK FOR 
THE MAIN POINT TO REMEMBER ABOUT LAYOUT AND STRUCTURE 
IS THAT THEIR CHIEF FUNCTION IS TO ALLOW THE LANGUAGE TO WORK 
THE CHOICE OF WORDS AND HOW THEY'RE PUT TOGETHER REALLY MAKES AN IMPACT ON THE READER'S MIND 
BUT HOW DO YOU COMMENT ON LANGUAGE 
TO HELP YOU THINK STRAIGHT UNDER PRESSURE 
NOBODY'S SAYING THAT AN AUTHOR SPENDS AGES CHOOSING EVERY SINGLE WORD 
BUT THERE ARE PATTERNS YOU CAN LOOK OUT FOR WORDS GROUPED TOGETHER 
TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON THE READER 
NOW HAVE A LOOK AT THIS PASSAGE ABOUT WOLVES 
THE AUTHOR FROM THE BORN FREE FOUNDATION IS TRYING TO CONVINCE HER READERS NOT TO BE AFRAID OF WOLVES 
SHE CHOOSES HER WORDS CAREFULLY 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE 
THIS MAGAZINE ARTICLE ABOUT VIVISECTION TESTING ON ANIMALS 
STARTS WITH A QUESTION PHRASED IN VERY EMOTIONAL LANGUAGE 
THIS BOTH ATTRACTS THE READER'S ATTENTION AND MAKES THEM THINK 
THERE IS AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BUT IT'S NOT EASY 
THE AUTHOR HAS CHOSEN TO PUT BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT ON EACH POINT 
FOR 
AGAINST 
AND CAREFULLY AVOIDS TAKING SIDES 
THE LANGUAGE USED TO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF TESTING 
IS CALM UNSENSATIONAL AND REASONABLE 
THE LANGUAGE USED AGAINST TESTING APPEALS DIRECTLY TO YOUR SENSE OF PITY FOR THE ANIMALS 
WHAT MADE IT EASY FOR THE WORDS TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION 
SENTENCES KNIT THE WORDS TOGETHER MAKING RHYTHMS OF THE LANGUAGE 
SO THAT THE MEANING BECOMES CLEAR 
WHEN LOOKING AT AN AUTHOR'S USE OF LANGUAGE THINK ABOUT THE CHOICE OF WORDS 
FOR EXAMPLE ANY GROUPS OR PATTERNS YOU CAN SEE 
AND THE CHOICE OF SENTENCES AND HOW THEY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE READER 
MANY NON LITERARY TEXTS ARE TRYING TO PERSUADE YOU TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT AN ISSUE 
YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE LAYOUT STRUCTURE AND LANGUAGE WORKING TOGETHER 
THIS COULD BE IN AN OBVIOUS WAY TO WARN ABOUT THE DANGER OF CIGARETTES 
ALCOHOL OR DRUGS 
BUT IN OTHER TEXTS IT'S HARDER TO SEE THAT YOU'RE BEING PERSUADED 
IN A PERSUASIVE PIECE THE AUTHOR USES LANGUAGE WHICH WILL CONVINCE THE READER 
THIS COULD CONTAIN A LOT OF FACTUAL OR STATISTICAL INFORMATION 
IT'S HARD TO ARGUE AGAINST FACTS 
LOOK AT THIS PARAGRAPH FROM THE NESSIE PASSAGE 
THE AUTHOR WANTS TO CONVINCE US SO THE LANGUAGE IS FACTUAL 
AT OTHER TIMES AN AUTHOR MIGHT TRY TO CONVINCE YOU 
BY THE SHEER FORCE OF WORDS 
CHOOSING WORDS WHICH MAKE A STRONG APPEAL TO YOUR EMOTIONS 
LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE EMOTIVE LANGUAGE OF LEAFLETS ABOUT VEGETARIANISM IS TAKEN OUT 
DOES IT SOUND AS BAD WHEN SOME OF THE DESCRIPTIVE WORDS AND PHRASES ARE REMOVED OR REPLACED 
A GOOD WAY OF LOOKING AT PERSUASION IS BY STUDYING A SPEECH 
IN A SPEECH YOU CAN OFTEN FIND EMOTIVE LANGUAGE WORKING WITHIN A HIGHLY ORGANISED STRUCTURE 
I HAVE A DREAM 
THAT ONE DAY THIS NATION WILL RISE UP 
AND LIVE OUT THE TRUE MEANING OF ITS CREED 
WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT 
THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL 
I THINK THAT BY USING CONTRASTING PAIRS 
HE DROVE HOME TO PEOPLE 
SOMETHING WHICH THEY THOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN 
A SLAVE OWNER SITTING WITH AN EX SLAVE 
YOUNG BLACK KIDS SITTING WITH YOUNG WHITE KIDS 
ONE DAY IN ALABAMA 
I HAVE A DREAM TODAY 
I THINK MARTIN LUTHER KING USED LANGUAGE IN THE STYLE OF SPEAKING 
THAT PEOPLE WERE USING AT THE TIME 
THE WORDS ARE VERY SIMPLE THAT WE REMEMBER I HAVE A DREAM 
POLITICIANS WOULD SAY I WANT TO SEE COUNTRIES NEGOTIATING 
BUT THE SIMPLE IMAGE OF BLACK AND WHITE CHILDREN 
WALKING ALONG TOGETHER 
IS AN IMAGE THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE IN A JUST WORLD CAN IDENTIFY WITH 
I HAVE A DREAM 
MARTIN LUTHER KING USED REPETITION 
BECAUSE AT THAT TIME NOT ALL THE PEOPLE WERE VERY WELL EDUCATED 
HE HAD TO PERFORM IT IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE REALLY REMEMBERED IT 
AND WERE ABLE TO PASS IT ON TO OTHER PEOPLE 
I HAVE A DREAM 
AT ONE POINT HE SAYS I HAVE A DREAM EIGHT OR NINE TIMES 
I HAVE A DREAM TODAY 
IT'S A BRILLIANT WAY OF DRUMMING IT HOME TO KEEP REPEATING IT 
I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY 
DOWN IN ALABAMA 
WITH ITS VICIOUS RACISTS 
WITH ITS GOVERNOR HAVING HIS LIPS DRIPPING 
WITH THE WORDS OF NULLIFICATION 
BY THIS TIME THE CROWD IS ECSTATIC THEY'VE CLIMBED UP THIS MOUNTAIN WITH HIM 
LET FREEDOM REIGN FROM THE SNOW CAPPED ROCKIES OF COLORADO 
LET FREEDOM REIGN FROM THE CURVACEOUS SLOPES OF CALIFORNIA 
BUT NOT ONLY THAT 
LET FREEDOM REIGN FROM STONE MOUNTAIN OF GEORGIA 
LET FREEDOM REIGN FROM LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN OF TENNESSEE 
LET FREEDOM REIGN FROM EVERY HILL AND MOLEHILL OF MISSISSIPPI 
FROM EVERY MOUNTAINSIDE 
LET FREEDOM REIGN 
WHEN WE ALLOW FREEDOM TO REIGN WHEN WE LET IT REIGN FROM EVERY VILLAGE AND EVERY HAMLET 
FROM EVERY STATE AND EVERY CITY 
WE WILL BE ABLE TO SPEED UP THAT DAY 
WHEN OF GOD'S CHILDREN 
BLACK MEN AND WHITE MEN 
JEWS AND GENTILES PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLICS 
WILL BE ABLE TO JOIN HANDS 
AND SING IN THE WORDS OF THE OLD NEGRO SPIRITUAL 
FREE AT LAST FREE AT LAST 
THANK GOD ALMIGHTY WE ARE FREE AT LAST 
I THINK IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC 
OR MAKE A VIDEO OR WHATEVER ON SOME ISSUE THAT THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT 
FIRST OF ALL THEY'VE GOT TO LEARN TO LOOK THE PEOPLE IN THE EYE 
I ALSO TELL PEOPLE TO USE THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU SPEAK 
USE THE EVERYDAY LANGUAGE THAT EVERYDAY PEOPLE SPEAK 
SO WHEN YOU'RE READING A TEXT WHICH IS TRYING TO PERSUADE 
THINK ABOUT THE WAY THE AUTHOR HAS APPEALED TO THE READER BY USING 
AND SENTENCES WHICH MAKE A DIRECT APPEAL 
SUCH AS QUESTIONS 
THIS IS THE END OF THE READING NON LITERARY TEXTS SECTION 
PLAY THIS PART OF THE PROGRAMME AS MANY TIMES AS YOU LIKE UNTIL YOU FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT IT 
THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO TAKE A BREAK OR MOVE ON TO WRITING NON LITERARY TEXTS 
ALL WRITERS ARE THIEVES 
YOU NEED TO STEAL FROM YOUR READING AND USE IT IN YOUR WRITING 
THIS WAY YOU'LL FIND IT MUCH EASIER WRITING FOR YOUR READER 
MY IDEAS JUST COME FROM ANYWHERE 
AND EVERYWHERE THEY DROP INTO YOUR LAP UNEXPECTEDLY 
IT MIGHT BE AN OVERHEARD REMARK 
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE SITUATION THAT YOU OBSERVE HAPPENING IN THE STREET OR IN PUBLIC 
OR IT MIGHT BE AN ARTICLE THAT I'M READING IN A NEWSPAPER 
IT CAN BE A VERY TINY TRIGGER 
I WISH I KNEW WHERE I GOT MY ORIGINAL IDEAS FROM 
THEN I COULD BOTTLE IT AND NOT WORRY ABOUT IT 
BECAUSE I THINK FOR MOST WRITERS THE BIGGEST WORRY IS 
I KNOW IT IS FOR ME IS RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS 
I NEVER GET A WHOLE HUGE LONG DETAILED IDEA FOR A BOOK 
BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN THERE WILL BE JUST SOME TINY IMAGE THAT WILL APPEAL TO ME 
AND I THINK MM I LIKE THAT 
A LOT OF THE TIME YOUR IDEAS SORT OF HUNT YOU DOWN 
AND YOU DON'T REALLY INVENT YOUR OWN IDEAS 
YOUR IDEAS COME LOOKING FOR YOU 
IN THE READING PAPER YOU HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN YOUR ANSWERS 
ABOUT HOW ANOTHER AUTHOR USES LANGUAGE STRUCTURE AND LAYOUT 
NOW YOU BECOME THE AUTHOR AND YOU'LL NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT EXACTLY THE SAME THINGS 
ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT SO EASY IN THE TEST WHEN YOU HAVE TO KEEP TO A FIXED TIME 
AND WRITE UNDER PRESSURE 
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS TO VISUALISE THE READER 
WHO IS THE AUDIENCE FOR YOUR WRITING 
THE WRITING TASKS WILL TELL YOU THIS 
LIKE ANY AUTHOR YOU'LL NEED TO 
THINK ABOUT YOUR PURPOSE 
CHECK THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE AUDIENCE 
DECIDE WHAT WILL BE THE BEST LAYOUT SOMETIMES THE TASK WILL TELL YOU 
THEN PLAN YOUR STRUCTURE 
THINK ABOUT THE STYLE OF LANGUAGE YOU WILL USE 
INCLUDING SENTENCES AND VOCABULARY 
AND FINALLY YOU WILL NEED TO CHECK YOUR WORK BEFORE HANDING IT IN 
TO MAKE SURE IT IS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE SHAPE 
YOU WILL HAVE TWO WRITING TASKS 
ONE LONGER AND ONE SHORTER 
YOU HAVE FORTY FIVE MINUTES FOR THE LONGER WRITING TASK 
AND THIRTY MINUTES FOR THE SHORTER ONE 
YOU SHOULD SPEND FIFTEEN MINUTES PLANNING YOUR ANSWER TO THE LONGER TASK 
SO YOU HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT THE THINGS LISTED 
THIS WILL LEAVE YOU WITH ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO WRITE YOUR RESPONSE 
AND THEN ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES FOR REREADING 
PAST TOPICS HAVE INCLUDED 
PART OF THE ASSESSMENT OF YOUR WRITING IN THE TEST 
IS BASED ON YOUR IDEAS AND THE WAY YOU ORGANISE THEM 
IN ORDER TO DO WELL IN THIS AND GET THE MARKS 
YOU'LL NEED TO THINK AND PLAN BEFORE YOU START WRITING 
THE WRITING TASKS ARE GIVEN TO YOU IN A WAY 
THAT SETS UP A MUCH MORE REAL CONTEXT FOR THE WRITING YOU HAVE TO DO 
COMING UP ARE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT 
MAKE A NOTE OF THE AUDIENCE PURPOSE AND LAYOUT BEING ASKED FOR 
WHY NOT PAUSE THE PROGRAMME 
AND WRITE YOUR NOTES ABOUT AUDIENCE PURPOSE AND LAYOUT 
SO HOW DID YOU GET ON 
LET'S LOOK AT THE KEYWORDS YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED 
HERE ARE TWO MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO GO THROUGH 
WHY NOT PAUSE THE PROGRAMME AND JOT DOWN YOUR NOTES 
SO THE KEYWORDS YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTED DOWN FOR QUESTION TWO ARE 
IN QUESTION THREE THE KEYWORDS ARE 
REMEMBER THE FIRST STEP IS TO ASK YOURSELF 
WHO AM I WRITING TO 
I THINK MARKERS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO REWARD 
WHAT I WOULD CALL CONSCIOUS CRAFTSMANSHIP 
A PUPIL WHO HAS A SENSE OF PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE ABOUT THEIR WRITING 
HAS MATCHED THAT SENSE OF PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE WITH A APPROPRIATE FORM AND STRUCTURE 
AND THEN WRITTEN UP IN AN ENGAGING AND EFFECTIVE WAY 
TO ACHIEVE WHATEVER THE PURPOSE MAY BE 
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ACTUALLY GIVE YOU IDEAS FOR THE KIND OF THINGS YOU COULD WRITE ABOUT 
AND THESE CAN ACT AS A STARTING POINT 
A PLANNING FRAME WILL BE PROVIDED WITH THE LONGER WRITING TASK 
BUT HOW YOU USE IT IS UP TO YOU 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GOING ABOUT PLANNING AND YOU'LL HAVE PRACTISED SOME OF THEM IN CLASS 
YOU COULD CHOOSE TO WRITE YOUR IDEAS DOWN IN THE FORM OF A BRAINSTORM 
WHICH MEANS GATHERING A LOT OF IDEAS QUICKLY 
OR MAYBE A SPIDER DIAGRAM 
OR A MORE SIMPLE PARAGRAPH PLAN LIKE THIS 
WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOME IDEAS TOGETHER 
YOU COULD USE THE PLANNING FRAME TO HELP YOU SORT THEM OUT 
I USUALLY JOT A FEW WORDS DOWN LIKE KEY PLACES 
AND I USUALLY DRAW A LINE AND PUT LIKE 
START MIDDLE AND END 
THEN I PUT HOW I'M GOING TO START IT HOW I'M GOING TO END IT 
AND THEN TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GONNA GO IN THE MIDDLE AND HOW I GET FROM START TO FINISH 
IN MY TEST I LIKE TO PLAN 
I USUALLY PLAN BY USING BULLET POINTS AND SPIDER DIAGRAMS 
SO I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT ORDER EVENTS COME IN 
EVEN PROFESSIONAL AUTHORS HAVE TO PLAN THEIR WRITING 
HERE'S LISA SMOSARSKI FROM BLISS MAGAZINE 
I'D RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE BEFORE THEY START WRITING ANYTHING 
DO A PLAN OR WRITE SOMETHING DOWN ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO 
WHEN YOU'RE WRITING NON FICTION IT'S VERY EASY TO JUST GO OFF THE POINT 
YOU HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION IN YOUR HEAD AND THAT CAN GET REALLY CONFUSING 
I USUALLY WRITE SOME NOTES AT THE VERY BEGINNING 
BEFORE I'VE GOT ANY INFORMATION 
SAYING WHAT EXACTLY I WANT TO ACHIEVE FROM THE FEATURE 
SO I WRITE DOWN THE MAIN POINTS THERE'LL BE FIVE OR SIX POINTS 
THAT WILL BE INTERVIEWS IDEAS KEY PHRASES PERHAPS 
ONCE I'VE DONE THAT AND GATHERED ALL THE INFORMATION I NEED 
I'LL COME BACK AND TYPE IT ALL UP SO THAT I HAVE IT ALL IN FRONT OF ME 
WHEN I'VE GOT ALL THE INFORMATION I'LL WRITE A PLAN 
WHICH WILL BE STEP BY STEP PARAGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH 
OF WHAT I WANT TO GET OUT OF THE FEATURE 
SO IT WILL BE FROM THE INTRODUCTION TAKING IT INTO A QUOTE FOR EXAMPLE 
AND THEN ADDING ANOTHER PIECE 
ONCE I'VE DONE THAT I'LL LOOK AT MY PLAN AND THINK 
IS THAT O. K. DOES THAT WORK 
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT AND PERHAPS MAKE A COUPLE OF CHANGES 
WHEN I'M HAPPY WITH IT I'LL BEGIN TO WRITE BUT I WON'T BE ABLE TO DO IT UNTIL I'VE GOT THAT PLAN 
WRITING NON FICTION THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO BEAR IN MIND 
IS THAT THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF NON FICTION IS TO GET ACROSS SOME INFORMATION TO THE READER 
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO DEVISE THE BEST FORMAT IN WHICH TO ACHIEVE THAT 
NOW SOMETIMES THAT MAY MEAN PUTTING IN A TABLE 
OR A TIMELINE A COUPLE OF CARTOONS A LITTLE ANECDOTE 
IT CAN INVOLVE ALL OF THOSE THINGS 
A LOT OF THINGS LIKE FORMATS COME TO ME AS I'M WRITING THEM 
SO THERE'S THE STORY OF THE BOY WHO HAD TO CHOP OFF THE OLD LADY'S HEAD IN TUDOR TIMES 
IT WAS A TREMENDOUS STORY BUT I WANTED TO LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE VIEWPOINT 
THROUGH THE EYES OF THE BOY HOW MIGHT HE HAVE FELT ABOUT IT 
AND I THOUGHT A GOOD WAY TO DO THIS WOULD BE TO HAVE HIM WRITING A LETTER HOME TO HIS MOTHER 
SO THAT BECAME A LETTER THE FORMAT WAS A LETTER 
DEAR MUM HERE I AM AT THE TOWER OF LONDON 
I'VE JUST HAD AN AWFUL JOB RIGHT BECAUSE IT TAKES YOU IN 
I WOULD LIKE TO DO IT AS A NEWSPAPER 
IF A NEWSPAPER WAS WRITTEN IN EGYPTIAN TIMES 
HOW WOULD THEY DESCRIBE THE DEATH OF TUTANKHAMUN 
BECAUSE NEWSPAPERS ARE VERY GOOD WAYS OF PRESENTING INFORMATION 
YOU GET THE MAIN FACTS AT THE BEGINNING 
AND THEN THE INTERESTING LITTLE BITS THAT SUPPORT THE STORY COME GRADUALLY AFTERWARDS 
IT'S A SKILL WE ALL NEED TO LEARN HOW NEWSPAPER WRITERS WORK 
IN YOUR TEST PAPER YOU'LL BE GIVEN GUIDANCE 
ON THE TYPE OF WRITING YOU HAVE TO DO 
AND MAKE SURE YOU PLAN THE ENDING OF YOUR PIECE 
A GOOD ENDING MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE 
IN YOUR TEST YOU MIGHT BE ASKED TO WRITE A LETTER AND YOU'LL NEED TO USE THE RIGHT LAYOUT 
AN INFORMAL LETTER IS TO A PERSON YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH 
TO INCLUDE PERSONAL THOUGHTS 
FOR A FORMAL LETTER YOU'LL NEED TO WRITE YOUR OWN ADDRESS 
IN THE TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE PAGE 
THE DATE VERY IMPORTANT THAT 
THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE PERSON YOU'RE WRITING TO 
DEAR FOLLOWED BY THE PERSON'S NAME 
IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE NAME YOU SHOULD WRITE SIR OR MADAM 
WRITE THE MAIN BODY OF THE LETTER IN PARAGRAPHS 
AND TO FINISH YOU HAVE TO SELECT THE RIGHT SIGN OFF 
IF YOU HAVE USED THE PERSON'S ACTUAL NAME 
USE YOURS SINCERELY 
IF YOU HAVEN'T USED THE PERSON'S NAME 
USE YOURS FAITHFULLY 
THAT MIGHT SEEM TO YOU TO BE OVERDOING IT A LITTLE 
WHY ALL THE RULES 
WELL IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU'RE WRITING TO SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW 
YOUR LETTER IS REPRESENTING YOU 
YOU WANT TO PRESENT YOUR IDEAS PROPERLY 
SO IT'S BEST TO FOLLOW A STYLE OTHER PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT 
IF YOU'RE WRITING AN INFORMAL LETTER TO SOMEONE YOU KNOW WELL 
THE FORMAT IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY NO NEED TO PUT THEIR ADDRESS AS YOU BOTH KNOW IT 
AND YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM A RANGE OF SIGN OFFS 
DEPENDING ON HOW PASSIONATELY YOU FEEL ABOUT THE PERSON 
AND JUST IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING 
THE TEST PAPER PROBABLY WON'T ASK YOU TO WRITE A LOVE LETTER 
IF FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE ASKED TO PRODUCE SOMETHING LIKE A LEAFLET 
THEN IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO USE HEADINGS SUBHEADINGS 
BULLET POINTS AND FRAMES OR UNDERLINING FOR A PARTICULAR POINT 
BUT DON'T GET INVOLVED IN ARTWORK 
DON'T GET INVOLVED IN FANCY DECORATIONS AND PICTURES AND ILLUSTRATIONS 
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO MARKS ON KEY STAGE THREE ENGLISH PAPERS 
FOR WHAT MIGHT BE BEST DONE IN AN ART LESSON 
NOW LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT PLANNING LAYOUT AND STRUCTURE TOGETHER 
LOOK AT THIS QUESTION 
REMEMBERING WHAT WE SAID ABOUT PLANNING 
WHY NOT PAUSE THE PROGRAMME AND GIVE YOURSELF TEN MINUTES 
TO PLAN A LAYOUT AND STRUCTURE FOR YOUR ANSWER 
HERE'S HOW YOUR LETTER MIGHT LOOK 
PARAGRAPH ONE WOULD BE AN INTRODUCTION 
SAYING WHO I AM AND THE REASON I AM WRITING 
THIS WOULD GIVE MRS. EMERSON THE FACTS SHE NEEDS 
PARAGRAPH TWO MIGHT ARGUE THAT FENCING THE AREA OFF 
AND TAKING AWAY THE BENCHES IS AN OVERREACTION TO A SMALL PROBLEM 
CAUSED BY A FEW MINDLESS PEOPLE 
PARAGRAPH THREE COULD HAVE A MORE POSITIVE TONE 
AND SUGGEST OTHER WAYS THAT THE PROBLEM COULD BE SOLVED 
LIKE REGULAR POLICE CHECKS 
PARAGRAPH FOUR WOULD PUT THE POINT 
THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW MEETING PLACES IN TOWN 
SO INSTEAD OF TAKING THEM AWAY THE COUNCIL SHOULD BE PROVIDING MORE 
PARAGRAPH FIVE WOULD FINISH ON ANOTHER POSITIVE NOTE 
SAYING THAT THE COUNCIL SHOULD THINK TWICE 
BEFORE AFFECTING SO MANY PEOPLE 
AND THAT IF THE DECISION WAS REVERSED EVERYONE WOULD BENEFIT 
AND IN TERMS OF LAYOUT 
MAKE SURE YOU PUT BOTH ADDRESSES IN THE CORRECT PLACE 
AND AS YOU'RE PUTTING MRS. EMERSON'S NAME AFTER DEAR 
YOU SHOULD SIGN OFF WITH YOURS SINCERELY 
THE TOPIC SENTENCES IN YOUR LETTER COULD READ SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
PARAGRAPHING IS IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE IT GIVES SHAPE AND STRUCTURE TO YOUR WORK 
WHEN YOU'RE PLANNING IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF PARAGRAPHS 
IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF A TOPIC SENTENCE 
OR A MAIN HEADING FOR EACH PARAGRAPH THEN YOU WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE 
AND A BETTER CLEARER IDEA OF WHERE YOU'RE STARTING 
AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO END IN YOUR PIECE OF WRITING 
SO REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE PLANNING YOUR LAYOUT AND STRUCTURE 
THINK IN TERMS OF PARAGRAPHS 
PLAN THEM WITH A SEPARATE HEADING FOR EACH 
CHECK THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT ORDER SO THE READER CAN FOLLOW YOUR THOUGHTS 
AND PRACTISE HOW TO SET OUT A LETTER AND AN ARTICLE 
SO YOU WON'T WASTE TIME IF ONE OF THESE COMES UP IN YOUR TEST 
ONCE YOU'VE PLANNED YOUR LAYOUT AND STRUCTURE FOR WRITING A LETTER 
YOU'LL BE READY TO WORK ON THE CONTENT 
THE TWO POINTS TO REMEMBER HERE ARE 
THE PEOPLE WHO MARK YOUR TEST 
WILL BE LOOKING TO SEE WHETHER YOU'VE MADE CHOICES 
RATHER THAN JUST WRITTEN WHATEVER CAME INTO YOUR HEAD 
LET'S GO BACK TO THE LETTER PLAN AND THE NOTES FOR PARAGRAPH ONE 
IT SAYS 
THE WHOLE THING COULD SOUND QUITE AGGRESSIVE 
AND YOU WANT TO GET MRS. EMERSON AND THE COUNCIL ON YOUR SIDE 
THE PROBLEM HERE IS PARTLY TO DO WITH THE CHOICE OF LANGUAGE 
AND PARTLY THE WAY THE SENTENCES WORK 
YOUR CHOICE OF LANGUAGE NEEDS TO BE THOUGHTFUL 
WORDS AND PHRASES SUCH AS STUPID AND THE PITS 
MAY SEEM QUITE STRONG 
AND IN A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
BUT HERE WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT AUDIENCE AND PURPOSE 
YOU'RE WRITING TO SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW 
AND YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING DONE 
WORDS LIKE THESE GIVE SOMEONE AN EXCUSE NOT TO LISTEN 
BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE IS TOO AGGRESSIVE 
IF WE SEARCH FOR SOME ALTERNATIVES FOR THE WORD STUPID 
WE MIGHT COME UP WITH 
I'M SURE YOU CAN PROBABLY THINK OF OTHERS 
AND A PHRASE LIKE THE PITS COULD BE REPLACED BY 
LET'S GO TO THE EXPERTS FOR SOME ADVICE 
ABOUT CHOOSING LANGUAGE FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSES 
O. K. THE MAIN THING THAT WE NEED TO DO WITH THIS POSTER 
IS BUILD AWARENESS OF THE CHILDREN'S SOCIETY 
IN SOME NON LITERARY TEXTS SUCH AS A POSTER 
JUST ONE SENTENCE MIGHT BE NEEDED 
SO IT HAS TO BE EXACTLY RIGHT FOR ITS PURPOSE 
WE'RE SAYING WE LET THEM SPEAK OUT 
THIS GROUP WORKED ON A CAMPAIGN POSTER FOR CHILD PROTECTION 
THEY NEEDED TO PUT OVER A POWERFUL MESSAGE IN VERY FEW WORDS 
IT'S NOT A REAL IS IT REAL CUTESY OR 
IT'S NEITHER CUTESY NOR AGGRESSIVE IT'S SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE 
IT'S QUITE STREETWISE IT'S STREETWISE YEAH 
IT'S GOT TO BE PROVOCATIVE BECAUSE WITH A POSTER YOU'VE GOT ONE CHANCE TO GET PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO IT 
IT HAS TO BE QUITE SHORT AND SNAPPY 
YOU'VE GOT TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT SOME OF THE WORDS 
AND IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THE VERBS YOU USE ON THERE 
WHICH CAN CAPTURE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY 
FROM THE CHILD'S POINT OF VIEW THEY NEED TO BE HEARD 
AND THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK OUT 
ABOUT THE ISSUES AND THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY FACE 
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY 
IS THAT THE CHILDREN'S SOCIETY GIVES THEM A VOICE TO BE HEARD 
WHAT ARE THE KEY WORDS 
WHAT DID MIKE SAY IN THE BRIEF THE KEY WORDS WERE 
WAS IT LISTENING 
TALKING 
LISTENING OR SPEAKING 
TALKING LISTENING 
HEARING 
BEING HEARD 
IT'S MAINLY LISTENING ISN'T IT 
WE'VE GOT TO FIND AN INTERESTING WAY OF GETTING ACROSS A CHILD SAYING 
I WANT TO BE HEARD 
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME 
CAN YOU LISTEN TO ME 
IT NEEDS TO BE MORE POSITIVE IT NEEDS TO BE MORE BOLSHY 
YOU DON'T NEED REALLY WHAT I NEED 
JUST AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE WHAT I NEED IS A GOOD LISTENING TO 
THAT'S GOOD 
THE CHILDREN'S SOCIETY RUN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX PROJECTS 
THAT COVER ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT AREAS OF CHILDCARE 
WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WAS FIND SOMETHING 
THAT ACTUALLY RAN THROUGH ALL OF THEIR WORK 
THE LINE WHAT I NEED IS A GOOD LISTENING TO MAKES YOU LOOK AGAIN 
IT'S A VERY STRONG LINE BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUSLY TAKING 
WHAT I NEED IS A GOOD TALKING TO AND TURNING IT ON ITS HEAD 
THE PEOPLE WHO MARK YOUR TEST 
WILL BE LOOKING TO SEE IF YOU CAN MAKE CHOICES 
ABOUT WHICH TYPES OF SENTENCES TO USE 
THEY'LL WANT TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HANDLE THE SENTENCES OR THE SENTENCES HANDLE YOU 
YOU NEED TO VARY YOUR SENTENCE STRUCTURE AND WRITE FLUENTLY 
SO YOUR READER CAN GET THE MEANING WITHOUT FUSS 
AND YOUR WRITING FLOWS NATURALLY 
FLUENCY IS ALL DOWN TO HANDLING 
A FEW SIMPLE BUT VERY IMPORTANT GRAMMATICAL WORDS 
WHA'APPEN SIR I AND I LION IS TRYIN' TO SUPPORT THE SCENE 
ME FLINGING DOWN SOME SERIOUS LYRICS FOR CAPTURE THE PRIZE BEST POET IN A DE LAND 
NOW WHAT I WANT IS SOME MAJESTICAL WORDS THEN WHAT I SAID 
I AM ENTERING A POETRY COMPETITION 
AND IN ORDER TO COMPOSE THE WINNING PIECE 
I WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE SOME RATHER IMPRESSIVE WORDS 
I KNEW THAT I CAN TALK PATOIS 
NOW IF YOU REALLY WANT TO WIN YOUR POETRY COMPETITION 
THESE ARE THE WORDS YOU NEED 
HERE ARE THE TOP TEN THE OF TO 
AND A IN THAT IT FOR I 
IT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ME WANT NOT THE LITTLE MIDGET WORDS LIKE THEM 
WHAT ABOUT 
AH 
AMBIENCE 
AMBIENCE I LIKE THAT 
YAY AMBIENCE IS A MAJESTIC WORD IT'S A BAD WORD 
BUT HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU USE IT 
NOW TAKE A WORD LIKE UM THE 
IT DON'T LOOK LIKE MUCH 
IT DON'T SAY LIKE MUCH 
BUT IT'S A KILLER MAN IT'S KILLING 
WHEN ME WRITING MY POETRY HOW THEM LITTLE WORDS WORK I'LL SHOW YOU 
NOW IS THE WINTER 
OF OUR DISCONTENT 
MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER 
BY THE SUN OF YORK 
SOUND GOOD SOUND GOOD 
GIVE ME A HIGH TEN RESPECT YEAH MAN 
THESE VERY SIMPLE BASIC WORDS SUCH AS 
THEY HOLD THE KEY TO WRITING FLUENTLY 
AND VARYING YOUR SENTENCE STRUCTURE 
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT DAZZLING THE MARKER WITH IMPRESSIVE WORDS 
LET'S SEE HOW A YOUNG VEGETARIAN CHEF CAN IMPROVE THE MANUSCRIPT FOR HER COOKBOOK 
I BECAME VEGETARIAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO 
WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN AND HAVING DECIDED TO GO VEGETARIAN 
YOU JUST FIND MORE AND MORE REASONS 
MY PARENTS WERE REALLY BRILLIANT THEY DIDN'T THINK I'D KEEP IT UP 
BUT I HAD TO DO ALL MY COOKING I WAS COMMISSIONED 
TO WRITE THE BOOK I HAD TO WRITE A SYNOPSIS OF WHAT KIND OF BOOK 
I WAS GOING TO WRITE AND SEND IT TO THE PUBLISHERS AND SEE IF IT WAS O. K. 
AND HAVING SAID IT WAS O. K. THEN I HAD TO GO AWAY AND DO ALL THE THINGS I SAID I WAS GOING TO DO 
I WROTE DOWN A LIST OF CHAPTER HEADINGS AND THEN WENT AWAY AND WROTE THE CHAPTERS 
IT TOOK ABOUT SIX MONTHS TO WRITE IT AND THEN I DELIVERED THE FIRST DRAFT TO THE PUBLISHERS' 
I JUST THOUGHT WE MIGHT TALK ABOUT THE RECIPE 
ANNOUCHKA DELIVERS THE MANUSCRIPT AND IT'S MY JOB THEN 
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FACTS MAKE SENSE 
THAT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND THEM THAT THEY KNOW WHAT'S BEING SAID 
SO IT'S MY JOB TO PUT IT IN A LANGUAGE THAT MAKES IT REALLY CLEAR 
WHATEVER'S BEING SAID YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND 
THAT FIRST YOU'RE DOING ONE THING THEN YOU'RE DOING ANOTHER THING 
AND MAYBE THAT'S HAPPENING YOU MIGHT DO SOMETHING ELSE 
BUT THESE WORDS IN BETWEEN MAKE CLEAR IN WHAT ORDER YOU'RE COOKING 
AND WHAT PROCESSES YOU'RE GOING THROUGH TO PRODUCE THE MEAL 
THE FIRST INSTRUCTION IS CLEAR YOU SAY PUT THE RICE IN THE SAUCEPAN 
AND COOK IT ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PACKET YEAH 
THEN YOU SAY OR YOU COULD COOK IT IN VEGETABLE STOCK 
INSTEAD OF SAYING OR YOU MIGHT SAY INSTEAD 
INSTEAD YOU MIGHT COOK IT IN VEGETABLE STOCK YEAH 
SO IT'S CLEAR THEY'VE GOT A CHOICE OF ONE OR THE OTHER YEAH BUT THEN 
AS YOU SAY YOU COULD DO SEVERAL THINGS WHILE THE RICE IS COOKING YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT 
WHERE IT SAYS CHOP THE ONION CARROTS AND PEPPERS 
WE COULD HAVE PUT AT THE BEGINNING WHILST THE RICE IS COOKING 
I'D NEVER THINK OF SAYING THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS OBVIOUS 
IF THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FOLLOW A RECIPE THEY'LL BE SITTING AROUND THE WHOLE TIME THE RICE IS COOKING 
I THINK THAT WAS THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST DRAFT I'M JUST SUCH A SLOPPY COOK 
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY SO YOU SAY PUT SOME PEAS SOME CARROTS COOK FOR A WHILE 
WHICH YOU CAN'T DO IN A BOOK FOR CHILDREN YOU'VE GOT TO SAY EXACTLY WHAT TO DO 
WE MIGHT JUST SAY MEASURE OUT THE PEAS AND THE SWEETCORN 
OTHERWISE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT LOADS TO DO 
DRAIN THE RICE WHEN DO YOU DRAIN THE RICE 
WHEN THE RICE IS COOKED FINE 
BUT IF YOU JUST SPELL IT OUT 
PEOPLE ARE SURE OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY DON'T GET CONFUSED 
BUT I THINK JUST A FEW WORDS TO MAKE IT CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT'S FINE 
THE RECIPE ITSELF LOOKS GREAT GREAT THANK YOU 
THAT EDITOR WAS ADDING IN LINKING WORDS TO MAKE THE MEANING CLEARER 
THESE ARE THE KEY WORDS WHICH HELP YOU BUILD SENTENCES 
OR CHANGE DIRECTION 
THERE ISN'T A PRECISE FORMULA TO WRITING FLUENTLY 
HOWEVER YOU CAN JOIN YOUR THOUGHTS IN MORE THAN ONE WAY 
THIS PAIR OF SENTENCES COULD BE JOINED LIKE THIS 
OR PERHAPS LIKE THIS 
OR 
HERE ARE SOME MORE EXAMPLES OF SIMPLE SENTENCES FOR YOU TO TRY 
WHY NOT PAUSE THE PROGRAMME 
AND THINK HOW YOU COULD JOIN THESE SENTENCES 
SO THEY READ MORE FLUENTLY 
LINK THEM TOGETHER USING SOME OF THE WORDS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN 
HERE'S HOW YOU MIGHT HAVE LINKED THE SENTENCES 
USING CONNECTIVES WILL HELP YOU TO VARY YOUR SENTENCE STRUCTURE 
THIS WILL MAKE YOUR WRITING MORE INTERESTING 
A SENTENCE WILL SOMETIMES FLOW MORE EASILY 
IF YOU COMPRESS THE LANGUAGE A LITTLE 
YOU COULD CHANGE 
TO JUST 
VARYING SENTENCE STRUCTURE IS CRUCIAL FOR GOOD WRITING 
AND LOTS OF PRACTISE REALLY HELPS 
LOOKING AT A SPEECH IS AN IDEAL WAY OF EXPLAINING SENTENCE STRUCTURE 
BECAUSE WRITING A SPEECH MEANS YOU HAVE TO BE VERY IMAGINATIVE IN YOUR USE OF SENTENCES AND LANGUAGE 
YOU MUST BE AWARE OF THE EFFECT OF YOUR LANGUAGE ON AN AUDIENCE 
THEY ARE CLOTHED IN VELVET AND CAMLET FURRED WITH GRISE AND WE ARE VESTURED IN POOR CLOTH 
THEY HAVE THEIR WINE SPICES AND GOOD BREAD AND WE HAVE THE DRAWING OUT OF THE CHAFF AND DRINK WATER 
THEY DWELL IN FAIR HOUSES AND WE HAVE THE PAIN AND TRAVAIL THE RAIN AND THE WIND IN THE FIELDS 
AND BY THAT THAT COMETH OF OUR LABOURS THEY KEEP AND MAINTAIN THEIR ESTATES 
WE BE CALLED THEIR BONDMEN AND WITHOUT WE DO READILY THEM SERVICE WE BE BEATEN 
AYE 
AND WE HAVE NO SOVEREIGN TO WHOM WE MAY COMPLAIN WHO WILL HEAR US OR DO US RIGHT 
AYE AYE LET US GO TO THE KING 
AND SHEW HIM WHAT SERVAGE WE BE IN AND SHEW HIM HOW WE WOULD HAVE IT OTHERWISE 
AYE TO THE KING 
LOOK AT THE FIRST THREE SENTENCES IN JOHN BALL'S SPEECH TO THE PEASANTS 
HE WANTS TO POINT OUT THE THEM AND US SITUATION 
TO GAIN THE PEASANTS' SUPPORT SO THEY TAKE HIS SIDE 
RATHER THAN THAT OF THEIR MASTERS 
HE USES COMPOUND SENTENCES WHICH ALLOWS HIM TO SAY 
THEY ARE AND WE ARE AND THEY HAVE AND WE HAVE 
THIS PATTERN IS REPEATED IN THE SECOND AND THIRD SENTENCES 
AND AGAIN FURTHER INTO THE SPEECH 
WE BE CALLED THEIR BONDMEN AND WITHOUT WE DO READILY THEM SERVICE WE BE BEATEN 
BY USING PRONOUNS AND COMPOUND SENTENCES 
HE PITCHES TWO IDEAS AGAINST EACH OTHER 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT ANOTHER SPEECH 
MADE BY SOJOURNER TRUTH IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY TWO 
LOOK AT ME LOOK AT MY ARM 
I HAVE PLOUGHED AND PLANTED AND GATHERED INTO BARNS AND NO MAN COULD HEAD ME 
AND AIN'T I A WOMAN 
I COULD WORK AS MUCH AND EAT AS MUCH AS A MAN 
WHEN I COULD GET TO IT AND BEAR THE LASH AS WELL 
AND AIN'T I A WOMAN 
I HAVE BORNE THIRTEEN CHILDREN AND SEEN MOST ALL SOLD INTO SLAVERY 
AND WHEN I CRIED OUT A MOTHER'S GRIEF NONE BUT JESUS HEARD ME 
AND AIN'T I A WOMAN 
THAT LITTLE MAN IN BLACK THERE SAY 
A WOMAN CAN'T HAVE AS MUCH RIGHTS AS A MAN COS CHRIST WASN'T A WOMAN 
WHERE DID YOUR CHRIST COME FROM 
FROM GOD AND A WOMAN MAN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM 
SOJOURNER TRUTH KNEW SHE WOULD ONLY HAVE ONE OPPORTUNITY 
TO CONVINCE HER AUDIENCE THAT WOMEN ARE AS EQUAL AS MEN 
SO SHE USES SENTENCES VERY SKILFULLY 
SHE USES IMPERATIVE VERBS IN SIMPLE SENTENCES 
TO OPEN HER SPEECH AND HOOK HER AUDIENCE 
SHE COMMANDS THEM TO LOOK AT ME 
THIS MAKES SURE SHE HAS THEIR ATTENTION 
THEN SHE USES THE PATTERN OF THREE IN A COMPOUND SENTENCE STRUCTURE 
SO HER SPEECH HAS A STRONG RHYTHM 
AND CARRIES THE LISTENER ALONG WITH HER 
I HAVE PLOUGHED AND PLANTED AND GATHERED INTO BARNS AND NO MAN COULD HEAD ME 
THE USE OF THE I AND THE ME 
AT THE BEGINNING AND ENDING OF THE SENTENCE KEEPS THE FOCUS ON HER 
THEN VERY CLEVERLY 
JUST TO MAKE SURE THE CROWD REALLY ARE STILL WITH HER 
SHE USES A SHORT RHETORICAL QUESTION 
AND AIN'T I A WOMAN 
THE SHORTNESS OF THIS QUESTION 
CONTRASTS WITH HER USE OF ROLLING COMPOUND SENTENCES 
SHE REPEATS THIS PATTERN THROUGHOUT THIS SPEECH 
SO THAT HER AUDIENCE IS CARRIED ALONG WITH HER 
IF YOU'RE ASKED TO WRITE A SPEECH FOR YOUR NON LITERARY TEXT 
IT WILL PROBABLY BE ON A GENERAL SUBJECT FOR EXAMPLE 
WHICH IS THE BETTER SPORT CRICKET OR FOOTBALL 
AS IN FOOTBALL OR CRICKET THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO EVERY ARGUMENT 
SO WHEN YOU COME TO WRITE A SPEECH 
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THE OTHER POINT OF VIEW 
SO YOU CAN ARGUE AGAINST SO WHICH IS BETTER FOOTBALL OR CRICKET 
FOOTBALL IS MUCH BETTER THAN CRICKET THE BEST SPORT IS CRICKET 
FOOTBALL IS MUCH MORE FUN THAN CRICKET CRICKET IS BEST 
FOOTBALL IS BETTER THAN CRICKET BECAUSE IT'S SO FAST MOVING THE ACTION'S NON STOP 
A GAME OF CRICKET ISN'T OVER IN NINETY MINUTES IT LASTS UP TO FIVE DAYS 
SO YOU CAN ENJOY IT FOR MUCH LONGER 
THE ATMOSPHERE AT A FOOTBALL MATCH IS ELECTRIC WITH THE CROWD ALL SINGING SONGS AND CHEERING GOAL 
CRICKET IS MUCH MORE RELAXING IT'S EXCITING BUT YOU MAKE A DAY OF IT 
THE FOOTBALL SEASON'S LONGER IT'S NINE MONTHS AND THEY PLAY WEEKLY 
AH BUT CRICKET IS PLAYED IN SUMMER SO THE WEATHER CAN BE FANTASTIC 
FOOTBALL TEAMS HAVE A STRONGER IDENTITY WITH THEIR OWN COLOURS 
CRICKET CLOTHES ARE ALWAYS WHITE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY A NEW SHIRT EVERY YEAR 
THEY SHOW UP AGAINST THE GRASS AND DON'T GO OUT OF FASHION 
THE RULES ARE SIMPLER IN FOOTBALL AND SCORING IS EASIER TO FOLLOW 
YES BUT THE SCORING IN CRICKET IS MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED 
IN FOOTBALL YOU JUST SCORE A GOAL IN CRICKET THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO SCORE POINTS 
YOU CAN PLAY FOOTBALL IN ALL WEATHERS FOOTBALLERS AREN'T AFRAID OF RAIN THEY DON'T RUN FOR COVER 
CRICKET IS DANGEROUS YOU CAN TELL BY ALL THE PADDING WE DON'T PLAY IN RAIN TO AVOID GETTING INJURED 
THERE ARE LOADS OF FOOTBALL TEAMS TO SUPPORT CRICKET HAS FAR FEWER 
YES BUT CRICKET'S BEEN AROUND MUCH LONGER THAN FOOTBALL IT'S OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS OLD CLUBS HAVE MORE HISTORY 
FOOTBALL MATCHES PLAY TO THE END FOR A RESULT EVEN IF IT'S A PENALTY SHOOT OUT OR HAS TO BE REPLAYED 
IN CRICKET IF YOU DON'T FINISH IT'S A DRAW 
MAYBE BUT THE MATCH IS STILL SATISFYING CRICKETERS' SKILLS ARE SO VARIED YOU NEED TO BAT 
BOWL AND FIELD 
FOOTBALL'S A GAME FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE PEAK OF THEIR PHYSICAL FITNESS 
YOU MUST BE FIT TO PLAY CRICKET BUT YOU CAN PLAY TO A MUCH OLDER AGE 
FOOTBALL IS FAR BETTER THAN CRICKET CRICKET IS FAR BETTER THAN FOOTBALL 
LOTS OF POINTS THERE 
LET'S SAY YOU WANT TO ARGUE FOR CRICKET 
AND IMPRESS ON PEOPLE THAT CRICKET IS BETTER THAN FOOTBALL 
THAT'S NOT A VIEW EVERYONE WOULD AGREE WITH SO YOU'LL NEED A STRONG OPENING 
HERE GOES 
THAT WOULDN'T WORK WOULD IT 
CHOOSING YOUR OPENING AND CLOSING SENTENCES CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE IMPACT OF YOUR WRITING 
PAUSE HERE AND THINK OF THREE WAYS 
YOU COULD START YOUR SPEECH WITH MORE IMPACT 
WHILE STILL USING PROPER SENTENCES 
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE SUBJECT 
YOU CAN TAKE THE OPPOSITE VIEW IF YOU WANTED 
SO WHAT DID YOU COME UP WITH 
HOW ABOUT 
OR 
OR 
HOPEFULLY YOUR CHOICE ISN'T THE ONES WE'VE COME UP WITH WILL DO THE JOB 
IN ANY PIECE OF WRITING YOU NEED TO LEAVE THE READER WITH AN IMPRESSION THAT WILL LAST 
WHY NOT PAUSE THE PROGRAMME AND THINK OF THREE WAYS YOU COULD END THE PIECE 
HOW DID YOU DO 
DID YOU COME UP WITH A GOOD ENDING 
HERE ARE SOME THOUGHTS ON HOW YOU MIGHT WRITE A CLOSING SENTENCE FOR YOUR SPEECH 
OR 
OR 
TO KEEP YOUR SPEECH EFFECTIVE YOU NEED TO 
LET'S HEAR MORE ABOUT WRITING SENTENCES FROM PROFESSIONAL WRITERS 
AT SMASH HITS WE DON'T NECESSARILY FOLLOW GRAMMATICAL RULES 
IF IT FEELS RIGHT WE WILL WRITE A SENTENCE THAT LASTS FOR AN ENTIRE PARAGRAPH 
IF WE WANT TO GET ACROSS THE IDEA THAT SOMETHING'S FAST MOVING A LOT OF ACTION 
WE'LL TEND TO USE VERY SHORT SENTENCES SOMETIMES NOT EVEN PROPER SENTENCES GRAMMATICALLY 
BUT JUST VERY SHORT VERY FAST AND PACY 
A BIT LIKE A TELEVISION PROGRAMME OR FILM IF THERE'S A PIECE OF ACTION 
THEY REALLY QUICKLY EDIT EDIT EDIT AND IT'LL CUT FROM THIS TO THIS TO THIS 
AND WE USE THOSE TECHNIQUES WHEN WE'RE WRITING IN SMASH HITS 
SENTENCE STRUCTURE IS VERY IMPORTANT 
IN CREATING A FEEL A MOOD A STYLE 
AND IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN TAUGHT PEOPLE TELL YOU ABOUT VERBS 
AND ADJECTIVES BUT THEY DON'T TELL YOU ABOUT SENTENCE STRUCTURE 
HOW A SERIES OF SHORT SENTENCES CAN MAKE THE PACE PICK UP VERY QUICKLY 
AND SOMETIMES A LONG FLOWING SENTENCE CAN DRAW YOU IN AND MAKE YOU SLEEPY 
AND THEN YOU HIT THEM WITH A SHORT SENTENCE AFTERWARDS 
SO FOR EXAMPLE I STARTED A BOOK ABOUT A LOCAL MONSTER WITH A VERY SLEEPY SENTENCE 
DEEP BENEATH THE CLEAR GREEN WATERS OF THE WEIR THE EVIL CREATURE LAY 
DREAMING BUT NOT ASLEEP AND THAT IS A VERY MENACING THREATENING ONE 
AS OPPOSED TO THE SHORT SHARP PUNCHY ONES UM 
WHEN I WANTED TO GIVE A DESCRIPTION OF A ISOLATED VILLAGE 
AND THERE'S A PLACE NOT FAR FROM HERE CALLED NO PLACE 
I THOUGHT MY VILLAGE COULD BE CALLED NOWHERE AND IT BEGAN NOBODY LIVED IN NOWHERE NOT NOW NO WAY 
NO PLACE LEFT TO LIVE AND SOMETIMES 
THAT CAN TAKE THE READER IN TO A SORT OF BOUNCY YOU MUST READ ON 
WHEN YOU'RE COMPOSING YOUR WRITING TRY TO 
SENTENCE STRUCTURE IS VERY IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE ONE OF THE WEAKNESSES THAT MARKERS REPORT TO ME 
ARE PUPILS WHO DON'T SHAPE THEIR SENTENCES PROPERLY THEY COMMA SPLICE PHRASES AND CLAUSES TOGETHER 
AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY'RE LOSING MARKS FOR POOR PUNCTUATION AND POOR SENTENCE STRUCTURE AT THE SAME TIME 
THEY'RE NOT STOPPING TO DIVIDE UP THEIR IDEAS IN A WAY THAT BUILDS FROM SENTENCE TO SENTENCE 
AND GIVES YOU A CLEAR STRUCTURE SO THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW THEIR LINE OF THOUGHT 
FIVE MINUTES SPENT ON CHECKING CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
THERE'S NO TIME FOR A MAJOR REWRITE BUT YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH AND TIDY UP ONE OR TWO MARK LOSERS 
REMEMBER 
LET'S GO THROUGH A PIECE OF WRITING 
WHICH WAS WRITTEN BY A STUDENT IN A TEST 
WE'VE CHANGED THE TEXT SLIGHTLY TO HIGHLIGHT THE MOST USEFUL WAYS TO CHECK 
SO THE FIRST THING YOU CAN CHECK IS PARAGRAPHING 
IT'S EASILY CHANGED IF YOU REALISE YOU SHOULD HAVE BEGUN A NEW PARAGRAPH AND DIDN'T 
SIMPLY MAKE A MARK LIKE THIS WHERE THE NEW PARAGRAPH SHOULD GO 
OR WRITE N. P. IN THE GAP BETWEEN THE SENTENCES 
AND DID YOU SPOT WHERE THE BREAKS SHOULD HAVE COME 
WE THOUGHT THE WRITING CHANGED FOCUS HERE 
PARAGRAPHING GIVES THE MARKER A MUCH CLEARER PATH THROUGH THE TEXT 
THEN CHECK YOUR SENTENCES READ YOUR WORK ALOUD TO YOURSELF IN YOUR HEAD 
IF YOU RUN OUT OF BREATH WHEN YOU'RE READING ALOUD OR NEED TO PAUSE IN YOUR READING TO ADD EMPHASIS 
ASK YOURSELF WHETHER A COMMA OR A FULL STOP IS NEEDED IF SO PUT ONE IN 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST MARK LOSERS IS 
TO ALLOW SENTENCES TO RUN INTO EACH OTHER IN OUR PASSAGE 
THERE'S ONE POINT WHERE THE SENTENCE STRUCTURE HAS BEGUN TO DRIFT 
SO WE COULD HELP BY ADDING A FULL STOP HERE 
ARE THERE ANY PUNCTUATION MARKS NEEDED TO MAKE THE PASSAGE CLEARER 
THERE'S A LIST HERE 
WHICH NEEDS COMMAS TO SEPARATE THE ITEMS LIKE THIS 
A QUESTION IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF ROUNDING OFF A PARAGRAPH 
BUT DON'T FORGET TO PUNCTUATE 
THERE'S JUST ONE SPELLING MISTAKE WHICH IS A COMMON MISTAKE DID YOU SPOT IT 
YES THE E. HAS BEEN LEFT OUT OF EXCITEMENT 
NO PROBLEM JUST MAKE A NEAT CHANGE LIKE THIS AND FINALLY 
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED SOME SLANG WHICH THE WRITER HAS USED 
THINGS CAN GO PEAR SHAPED IT'S QUITE A NORMAL EXPRESSION IN SPEECH 
BUT WHEN WRITING FOR AN AUDIENCE YOU DON'T KNOW YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL 
IT'S BEST TO CHANGE IT TO SOMETHING LIKE GO WRONG 
SO YOUR CHECKED WORK WILL END UP LIKE THIS 
WE'VE MADE MORE CORRECTIONS THAN YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO IN THE TEST 
AND IT STILL DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD EVEN TWO OF THESE CHANGES 
WOULD IMPROVE YOUR WORK AND YOUR FINAL MARK 
REMEMBER 
IF THE SPELLINGS LOOK WRONG THEY PROBABLY ARE 
THIS IS THE END OF THE WRITING NON LITERARY SECTION 
PLAY THIS PART OF THE PROGRAMME AS MANY TIMES AS YOU LIKE 
UNTIL YOU FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT IT 
THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO TAKE A BREAK OR MOVE ONTO DEVELOPING WRITING SKILLS 
IN YOUR ENGLISH TEST THERE WILL BE TWO OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR ABILITY TO WRITE 
A LONGER WRITING TASK AND A SHORTER WRITING TASK 
TO DO WELL IN THE LONGER WRITING TASK YOU NEED TO 
MORE THAN HALF OF THE MARKS THIRTY OUT OF FIFTY 
ARE AWARDED FOR THIS LONGER WRITING TASK 
IN THIS SECTION WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT SOME USEFUL SKILLS THAT WILL IMPROVE YOUR WRITING 
AND GAIN THOSE EXTRA MARKS 
HIGHLIGHT THESE POINTS ON THE QUESTION PAPER 
OR WRITE THEM ON YOUR ANSWER PAPER TO HELP YOU REMEMBER THEM WHILE YOU'RE WRITING 
LET'S TRY THIS QUESTION FROM A PAST TEST PAPER 
ONCE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THESE FEATURES 
THEY CAN HELP YOUR WRITING 
DON'T FORGET TO INCLUDE DETAILS OF YOUR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS 
AS WELL AS DESCRIBING THE UNUSUAL EVENT 
A LETTER TO A FRIEND IS INFORMAL 
IT WOULD BE MORE FORMAL WHEN WRITING TO YOUR HEADTEACHER 
OR A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT THIS LAYOUT IS A LETTER 
SO YOU NEED TO START WITH DEAR AND YOUR FRIEND'S NAME 
AND INCLUDE A SIGN OFF AND YOUR NAME AT THE END 
WHEN I MATCH MY WRITING TO THE AUDIENCE I THINK ABOUT LANGUAGE 
FORMAL OR INFORMAL LANGUAGE 
IF I'M TRYING TO WRITE TO SAY A NEWSPAPER EDITOR 
I'D USE A FIGURE IN A POSITION LIKE A HEADTEACHER AND IMAGINE I WAS WRITING TO HIM 
GETTING IDEAS CAN BE DIFFICULT 
THE TEST QUESTION WILL SUGGEST SOME IDEAS OR YOU COULD USE YOUR OWN 
EVERYBODY ASKS ME WHERE I GET MY IDEAS FROM 
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW 
SOMETIMES I MIGHT HAVE SEEN SOMEBODY AND THOUGHT THEY LOOKED INTERESTING 
AND I'VE WONDERED ABOUT THEM 
WHY THEY'RE LOOKING IN A PARTICULAR WAY 
I MIGHT HAVE SEEN A DOCUMENTARY ON T. V. ABOUT A PARTICULAR TYPE OF FAMILY 
AND START THINKING ABOUT THAT 
BUT MOSTLY AN IDEA JUST BOBS UP JUST LIKE THAT 
IT'S A BIT LIKE ME SAYING WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR DREAMS FROM 
SOMETIMES THEY'RE INFLUENCED BY THINGS GOING ON AROUND YOU 
OTHER TIMES THEY JUST COME STRAIGHT OUT OF THE BLUE 
LEARNING TO WRITE IS LIKE LEARNING TO SPEAK 
WE PICK UP LANGUAGE FROM THE PEOPLE AROUND US 
WHEN WE LEARN TO WRITE WE LEARN FROM THE BOOKS THAT WE READ 
AND CERTAINLY MY BOOKS ARE INFLUENCED BY LOTS OF WRITERS THAT I'VE LOVED 
I THINK THE PROCESS OF WRITING IS THE PROCESS OF READING AND WRITING 
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM GRIMSBY 
AND I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT THE HOTSPOT OF ADVENTURES 
SO I'VE WRITTEN STORIES ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE GRIMSBY LOOK MORE ADVENTUROUS 
SO I HAD A MORE EXCITING TIME 
SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES SAY WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR IDEAS FROM 
IT'S JUST KEEPING YOUR EYES AND EARS OPEN TO EVERYTHING AROUND YOU 
WRITE DOWN ALL THE IDEAS THAT OCCUR TO YOU ON A SUBJECT 
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU USE THEM IN THE END 
JUST GET EVERYTHING ON TO PAPER SO YOU CAN START DECIDING WHICH TO USE 
HAVE A GO AT JOTTING DOWN YOUR OWN IDEAS ABOUT THIS QUESTION 
BE CREATIVE 
AN UNUSUAL EVENT CAN BE FANTASY 
OR IT CAN BE BASED ON YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE LIKE 
ONCE YOU GET GOING YOU'LL BE AMAZED AT THE NUMBER OF GOOD IDEAS YOU GET 
BUT WATCH THE CLOCK DON'T GET TOO CARRIED AWAY 
IF YOU'VE GOT ONE REALLY GOOD IDEA 
THINK OF MORE DETAIL TO MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH FOR A GOOD ANSWER 
FINDING A MILLION POUNDS IS THE ONE I LIKE LET'S TRY THAT 
THE QUESTION IS ABOUT THE EVENT AND YOUR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS 
SO THE EVENT FIRST 
YES THAT'S A GOOD ONE 
THEN THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS 
ADD MORE KEY WORDS AS THIS WILL HELP YOU WHEN YOU START WRITING 
BE CAREFUL NOT TO SPEND TOO LONG ON THIS STEP FIVE MINUTES SHOULD DO 
ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR IDEAS YOU'RE ONLY ONE STAGE AWAY FROM STARTING TO WRITE 
THE NEXT STEP IS WHERE YOU SEQUENCE THE IDEAS IN YOUR PLAN 
NOW YOU'VE GOT SOME GOOD IDEAS PUT THEM IN A LOGICAL SEQUENCE 
THIS MEANS DECIDE ON THE ORDER YOU'RE GOING TO WRITE ABOUT THEM 
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE A LIST SO YOU CAN TICK OFF THE STAGES AS YOU WRITE 
BACK TO FINDING A MILLION POUNDS 
IF YOU PUT YOUR IDEAS IN ORDER RELATING TO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS 
YOU'LL GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
EVENT WALKING DOWN STREET 
CAR RACED PAST AND THREW BIN BAG OUT OF WINDOW 
FEELINGS ANNOYED AT HAVING BAG THROWN AT YOU 
EVENT HURT YOUR FOOT FEELINGS CONCERN ABOUT FOOT 
EVENT IT WAS ONE MILLION POUNDS 
FEELINGS SHOCK AT FINDING CONTENTS OF BAG 
AMAZEMENT AND EXCITEMENT AT REALISING AMOUNT 
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT 
EVENT RACED HOME AND HID MONEY 
FEELINGS WHETHER TO TELL PEOPLE 
REALISED COULD NEVER SPEND IT 
WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR LIST CHECK IT AND MAKE ANY CHANGES NEEDED 
IF ANYTHING IS MISSING NOW IS THE TIME TO PUT IT IN 
YOU REALISE YOU NEED SOMEWHERE TO HIDE THE MONEY TO TAKE IT HOME 
SO WHY NOT HAVE THE TROLLEY FROM YOUR PAPER ROUND OR YOUR SISTER'S PUSH CHAIR 
WHILE YOU'RE PLANNING IT'S EASY TO MAKE CHANGES 
NOW WHAT DO YOU DO 
EACH POINT IN YOUR PLAN WILL BE A PARAGRAPH IN YOUR WRITING 
CHECK YOU HAVE A REASONABLE NUMBER OF THINGS HAPPENING 
IN EACH PARAGRAPH 
WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY WITH YOUR LIST NUMBER IT TO MAKE IT EASY TO FOLLOW 
MOVE QUICKLY YOU ONLY HAVE TEN MINUTES OF PLANNING TIME 
BUT IT WILL MAKE YOUR ANSWER BETTER IN THE END 
WHEN PLANNING YOUR WRITING DON'T JUST SCRIBBLE DOWN ALL YOUR IDEAS 
LEAVE IT THERE AND START WRITING 
SORT THE IDEAS OUT CONSTRUCT A PLAN THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW DURING THE COURSE OF WRITING UP THE TASK 
SO IT SERVES YOU AS A SORT OF MAP 
TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW YOU'RE GOING AND TO MAKE SURE YOU GET TO THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE END 
IT'S HARD TO SPEND TEN MINUTES PLANNING I KEPT WANTING TO WRITE 
BUT I'M GLAD I DID PLAN IT I DIDN'T GET STUCK WHILE WRITING 
WITH A CLEAR PLAN YOU'RE ALL SET TO WRITE A GOOD ANSWER 
BUT BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO IN THE TEST 
YOU HAVE ABOUT TEN MINUTES FOR PLANNING 
YOU HAVE TO WRITE ENOUGH TO SHOW HOW WELL YOU WRITE 
BUT DON'T BE TOO AMBITIOUS 
AND KEEP AN EYE ON THE TIME 
PLAN YOUR PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY AND INCLUDE A GOOD ENDING 
ALLOW FIVE MINUTES AT THE END FOR CHECKING 
NEXT THE STYLE OF YOUR WRITING 
FOR ME WHAT MAKES A STORY GOOD 
IS LANGUAGE IT HAS TO BE WELL WRITTEN 
IT HAS TO HAVE A GOOD PLOT AND REALLY STRONG CHARACTERS 
THAT I CAN FEEL FOR THEM THE THINGS THEY'RE GOING THROUGH 
AND LIVING THROUGH THE STORY AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE STORY 
THE WRITING STYLE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME 
IT HAS TO READ ELEGANTLY 
UM SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT FINE WRITING 
IS JUST SORT OF LONG POETIC PHRASES 
I DON'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT BUT IT'S GOT TO SOUND RIGHT IN MY HEAD 
OTHERWISE I HATE TO READ IT 
I LOVE PACE AND PLOT IN STORIES 
I LIKE CAR CHASES AND EXPLOSIONS 
THEY MAKE A STORY GOOD TO READ 
I IMAGINE MY AUDIENCE AS ME AT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN 
SOMEBODY WHO CAN BE TURNED ON TO READING 
BUT IS VISUALLY LITERATE ABOUT FILM AND T. V. PROGRAMMES 
SO THE STORY HAS GOT TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS PACY 
AS FAST MOVING AS EVOCATIVE AS ANYTHING IN SCREEN OR T. V. 
HOW DO PROFESSIONAL WRITERS START THEIR STORIES 
I SUPPOSE I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME ON THE OPENINGS TO MY STORIES 
THE FIRST THIRD 
AND I SPEND A LOT OF TIME GETTING THE FIRST PARAGRAPH THE FIRST PAGE TO WORK REALLY WELL 
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN OPENING THAT'S SOMEHOW CATCHY 
THAT IS POWERFUL AND THAT SPEAKS FROM THE HEART OF THE STORY 
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY YOU'VE GOT TO HOOK THE READER 
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING NO ONE'S GONNA READ PAGE TWO IF PAGE ONE IS RUBBISH 
NO ONE WILL READ THE SECOND SENTENCE IF THE FIRST SENTENCE IS RUBBISH 
SO IT'S HOOKING THE READER THE WRITER'S CLICHE OF DEAD BODY ON PAGE ONE 
A LOT OF TIME WHEN WE BEGIN TO WRITE A STORY 
YOU'LL SPEND A COUPLE OF PARAGRAPHS TRYING TO FIND WHERE THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY IS 
THEN PROBABLY IT'S AFTER THREE PARAGRAPHS 
THEN YOU CAN THROW AWAY THE FIRST TWO PARAGRAPHS AND START IN THE PLACE OF THE TRUE BEGINNING 
MY FAVOURITE OPENING LINE OF ALL TIME IS IN THE IAIN BANKS NOVEL CALLED THE CROW ROAD 
AND THE OPENING LINE IS IT WAS THE DAY MY GRANDMOTHER EXPLODED 
WHAT A FANTASTIC OPENING TO A BOOK YOU HAVE TO READ ON 
OPENINGS SHOULD BE MAKING THE READERS ASK QUESTIONS 
THE READER SHOULD BE SAYING WHERE AM I WHO IS THIS PERSON 
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AND THEN YOU'VE HOOKED THE READER COS THEY HAVE TO READ AND FIND THE ANSWERS 
NOT LONG I EXPECT 
WHEN YOU'RE WRITING YOUR ANSWERS IN THE KEY STAGE THREE TEST 
YOU FACE THE SAME PROBLEM THAT WRITERS AND FILMMAKERS FACE 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CLIP AND JOT DOWN ALL THE TECHNIQUES 
THE WRITER USES TO HOOK HIS AUDIENCE 
JOHNNY BIT HIS LIP AND CONCENTRATED 
RIGHT COME IN QUICK 
LET THE MISSILE TARGET ITSELF 
ON THE FIRST FIGHTER FIRE THE MISSILE 
EMPTY THE GUNS AT THE FIGHTER 
HIT FIGHTER NUMBER TWO TAKE OUT ITS SHIELD WITH A LASER 
WHILE THE MISSILE TAKES OUT FIGHTER NUMBER ONE DIVE 
SWITCH GUNS AND READ FIGHTER NUMBER THREE AS IT TURNS 
PICK UP FIGHTER NUMBER TWO IN SIGHTS AGAIN 
AND LET GO OF THE MISSILE 
AND RAKE IT WITH FIGHTER NUMBER FOUR 
IT ALWAYS CAME IN LAST BUT IF YOU WENT AFTER IT FIRST 
THE OTHERS WOULD HAVE TIME TO TURN AND YOU'D END UP IN THE SIGHTS OF THREE OF THEM MISSILES AWAY 
WOW LUCKY HIT ON THE FIRST ONE 
DIE DIE DIE RED FIREBALL TAKE SHIELD WE'RE CONCENTRATING FIRE ON THE NEXT ONE 
THE LAST ONE WAS RUNNING BUT HE COULD OUTRUN IT HIT THE ACCELERATOR 
HE PUT HIM IN HIS SIGHTS WHILE HE POURED SHOT AFTER SHOT INTO HIM 
THE HUGE BULK OF THEIR CAPITAL SHIP WAS IN THE CORNER OF THE SCREEN 
CAREFUL CAREFUL 
THERE WERE NO MORE SHIPS NOW 
SO ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS KEEP OUT OF ITS RANGE 
AND SWEEP IN AND 
IF YOU WRITE A NON LITERARY PIECE LIKE A LETTER OR SPEECH 
YOU CAN USE ALL THE SAME TECHNIQUES 
ALTHOUGH YOU NEED TO GET TO THE POINT OF YOUR WRITING A BIT SOONER 
ENDINGS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT IN A PIECE OF WRITING 
SO YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE TIME TO WRITE ONE 
AND THAT IT BRINGS THE STORY TO A STRONG CONCLUSION 
EITHER HAPPY OR SAD 
LET'S HEAR WHAT THE PROFESSIONAL WRITERS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT ENDINGS 
I LIKE SATISFYING ENDINGS TO STORIES WHICH DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN 
THEY HAVE TO BE HAPPY I DON'T LIKE STORIES THAT ARE HAPPY JUST FOR THE SAKE OF BEING HAPPY 
I DON'T THINK ALL ENDINGS HAVE TO HAVE ALL THE ENDS TIED UP TOGETHER 
AND HAVE EVERY QUESTION ANSWERED 
BUT I DO LIKE TO FEEL THAT THE CHARACTERS CAN BE LEFT ALONE WITHOUT ME AND THEY'LL BE O. K. WITHOUT ME 
I THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT THE ENDINGS TO MY STORIES 
I TRY AND HAVE SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION 
I TRY AND HAVE AS HAPPY AN ENDING AS I CAN POSSIBLY MANAGE 
I DON'T WANT TO DEPRESS CHILDREN READING MY BOOKS 
I WANT IT TO BE A REALISTIC ENDING THOUGH 
I DON'T WANT EVERYTHING TO END ABSOLUTELY HAPPILY EVER AFTER UM 
BECAUSE LIFE ISN'T QUITE LIKE THAT 
ONE OF THE NICE THINGS I MUST ADMIT ABOUT THE LETTERS I GET SENT 
IS WHEN CHILDREN WRITE TO ME AND SAY OH BUT WE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED NEXT 
WHY DID YOU FINISH IT THERE THAT'S BRILLIANT BECAUSE IT MEANS 
THAT THEY BELIEVE IN THOSE CHARACTERS THE CHARACTERS HAVE A LIFE AFTER THE STORY HAS ENDED 
I DON'T THINK ALL ENDS HAVE TO BE TIED UP NEATLY 
I DON'T THINK EVERYTHING HAS TO BE RESOLVED 
BUT I DON'T LIKE CHEAT ENDINGS AT ALL 
I WANT TO FEEL REWARDED BY READING THE BOOK 
WITH AN UPLIFTING FEELING OR WITH A DIFFERENT VIEW ON THE WORLD 
TODD AND BLOD 
THE STORY CONTINUES 
SO BLOD THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL A ZORB 
NICE WORD EH ZORB 
I FEEL LIKE A HAMSTER TODD 
OOH WHAT WAS THAT 
MMM OH JUST A BUMP BLOD 
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS SAFE TODD 
COURSE IT'S SAFE BLOD 
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING TODD 
THAT'S HALF THE FUN OF IT BLOD 
WELL I LIKE TO KNOW WHERE I'M GOING TO END UP 
WHEN I WRITE A STORY IT'S THE FIRST THING I WORK OUT UNLIKE YOU 
YOUR STORY RATHER LIKE THIS ZORB HAS NO IDEA WHERE IT'LL END UP 
I KNOW HOW MY STORY ENDS THERE'S AN EXPLOSION AND STUFF 
AND EXPLOSION AND STUFF 
OH WELL THAT'S REALLY THOUGHT OUT 
TODD THE ENDING IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE OPENING 
IT'S LIKE THE PUNCH LINE OF A JOKE 
IF THE PUNCH LINE'S NO GOOD THE WHOLE JOKE'S NO GOOD 
ARE YOU SAYING MY STORY'S A JOKE 
IT WILL BE IF YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT THE ENDING 
LET'S RECAP 
JAMES HAS TRACKED DOGFOOD TO MR. TEETH'S H. Q. 
HE GETS CAPTURED ESCAPES SETS EXPLOSIVES 
GRAPPLES MR. TEETH INTO A CONVENIENT VAT OF ACID 
THEN ESCAPES JUST AS IT ALL GOES KABOOM 
NOT A GREAT PUNCH LINE TODD IT NEEDS MORE 
O. K. THERE'S AN ELITE GUARD 
THEY COME AT JAMES WITH RAZOR EDGE C. D.'S 
AND DOGFOOD SAVES THE DAY 
JAMES GETS OUT INTO A SEWER 
COMES UP A MANHOLE IN A BUSY STREET 
DUSTS HIMSELF DOWN AND WALKS OFF COOLLY 
WHAT ABOUT DOGFOOD YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM IT KEEPS THE READER GUESSING LIKE 
YOU CAN'T KILL DOGFOOD 
HE'S ONLY A CHARACTER BLOD 
HOW ABOUT A TWIST AT THE END 
O. K. JAMES TOSSES A COIN INTO AN BUSKER'S HAT THEN WALKS ON 
THE BUSKER LOOKS UP AND IT'S MR. TEETH 
HE DIDN'T DIE ALL SET FOR THE SEQUEL SEE BLOD 
OR MAYBE THERE COULD BE A DOUBLE TWIST SUCH AS 
JAMES WAKES UP AND IT WAS ALL A DREAM 
TODD THAT'S PATHETIC 
THAT IS THE CORNIEST ENDING YOU COULD POSSIBLY CONCEIVE 
BLOD LOOK OUT 
OH OH AAARGH 
OH OH THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT 
OF COURSE YOU'LL KNOW HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FINISH YOUR STORY 
BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE PLANNED IT AND WILL BE WORKING TOWARDS THIS ENDING ALL THE TIME YOU'RE WRITING 
SO ENDING WITH I REALISED I COULDN'T SPEND THE MONEY 
IS FAR BETTER THAN AND WHEN I WOKE UP IT WAS ALL A DREAM 
YOUR BEGINNING SHOULD 
YOUR ENDING SHOULD BE WHAT YOU DECIDED IN YOUR PLAN 
NOT WHATEVER COMES TO YOU IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES OF THE TEST 
IT SHOULD RESOLVE THE EVENTS OF YOUR STORY 
OR BE A CLEAR SUMMARY OF YOUR POINTS 
IF YOU'RE WRITING A SPEECH OR A LETTER 
SO NOW YOUR IDEAS ARE REALLY COMING TOGETHER 
AND YOU KNOW HOW TO GET THE READER INTO YOUR WRITING 
NEXT COMES THE IMPORTANT BIT 
THE WAY YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP THE READER INTERESTED 
ALL THE WAY THROUGH YOUR WORK THE ACTION LIKE THIS 
TAKING A ROLLED PASS FROM ELLIOT BELL 
BARRY SUDDENLY ACCELERATED DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALL 
HE FEINTED TO HIT THE BALL WITH HIS RIGHT FOOT 
AND THEN BROUGHT HIS LEFT LEG THROUGH TO HIT A SCREAMER ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE FLOOR 
NEVER TAKING HIS EYES OFF OF HARRY'S FEET AND THE BALL 
HOWARD DIDN'T EVEN FLICKER AS HARRY'S FEINT TEMPTED A SUDDEN MOVE 
BUT WHEN THE SHOT CAME IN HE WAS DOWN LIKE A PANTHER WITH THE BALL CRADLED IN HIS ARMS 
AN EXCITING BIT OF WRITING THERE 
BUT IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME 
THE AUDIENCE NEEDS TIME TO THINK 
SO THIS IS WHERE YOU NEED TO USE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES 
LIKE TENSION AND SUSPENSE TO MAKE YOUR ACTION WORK 
LIKE AUTHOR MALORIE BLACKMAN 
WHO WROTE A SCIENCE FICTION FOOTBALL STORY CALLED CONTACT 
IT IS A CROSSOVER OF GENRES IT WAS SCIENCE FICTION AND A SPORT STORY 
BUT REALLY I WANTED TO CONCENTRATE ON THE SUSPENSEFUL NESS THAT YOU GET IN A SCIENCE FICTION STORY 
IF I'M WRITING SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY TENSE 
I TRY AND SLOW IT DOWN SO THAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE STORY BEAT BY BEAT 
OR YOU'RE FOLLOWING YOUR MAIN CHARACTER BEAT BY BEAT 
WHAT ARE THEY FEELING 
EXPLORING IT USING ALL THEIR SENSES 
AND SHORT SENTENCES IN ONE PART OF IT IT JUST SAYS SILENCE 
I'VE WANTED TO BE A WRITER EVER SINCE I WAS YOUNG 
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ABOUT TEN I GOT ONE OF THOSE HOW TO WRITE MANUALS OUT OF THE LIBRARY 
WHICH I READ VERY SOLEMNLY 
AND I REMEMBER THEY HAD A PARTICULAR PASSAGE IN IT 
WHERE IT SAID SHOW DON'T TELL 
AND I DO THINK THIS IS VERY GOOD ADVICE 
IN THAT IF YOU HAVE A CHARACTER WHO'S VERY BOSSY VERY NAUGHTY VERY DIFFICULT 
IT'S A BIT DULL IF YOU JUST SAY SHE WAS VERY BOSSY NAUGHTY AND DIFFICULT 
BUT IF YOU SHOW HER ORDERING THE OTHER KIDS AROUND 
AND NOT BEING VERY FAIR 
AND SUDDENLY INVENTING SOME OUTRAGEOUSLY BAD NEW GAME OR SOMETHING 
THEN YOUR READER CAN PICK IT UP FOR THEMSELVES THAT SHE'S BOSSY NAUGHTY AND DIFFICULT 
AND IT'S MORE FUN FOR YOU AS A WRITER EXPANDING ON THESE THINGS 
GO FOR THE ACTION FIRST TELL THE STORY IN ITS BARE BONES 
TOO MANY ADJECTIVES TOO MUCH DESCRIPTION 
TOO MUCH DWELLING ON WHAT A PARTICULAR PERSON LOOKS LIKE 
OR WHAT THE WEATHER ON THE DAY WAS ONLY DISTRACTS FROM THE STORY 
FOR ME WHEN I'M MOVING A STORY FORWARD GETTING IT TRAVELLING 
I'M KIND OF WARY OF TAKING TOO MUCH TIME TO DESCRIBE THINGS 
IT'S MUCH BETTER TO SOMEHOW INTEGRATE THE DESCRIPTION AND THE ACTION 
SO THAT EVERYTHING'S HAPPENING TOGETHER CHARACTERS ARE BEHAVING 
YOU'RE ALSO DESCRIBING AND THE STORY'S MOVING FORWARD ALL AT THE SAME TIME 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DESCRIBE THE INSIDE OF A ROOM FOR EXAMPLE 
THEN HAVE SOMETHING HAPPENING IN THAT ROOM WHICH WILL CONVEY THE DESCRIPTION 
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU JUST HAVE A LIST OF WHAT'S IN THAT ROOM 
A CLOCK A MANTELPIECE A CHAIR IT'S VERY DULL 
BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY SNEAKING AROUND THE ROOM AND POKING IN DRAWERS 
AND FLIPPING THROUGH BOOKS AND FIDDLING WITH ORNAMENTS ON THE MANTELPIECE 
YOU'RE GETTING A DESCRIPTION OF THE ROOM AS WELL AS HAVING ACTION 
ACTION WILL MAKE YOUR WRITING MORE INTERESTING 
SEEING HEARING AND EVEN SMELLING 
THE FINAL STYLE FEATURE TO CONSIDER IS VOCABULARY 
OR THE WORDS YOU USE 
WHICH OF THESE TWO SENTENCES SOUNDS BETTER 
INTERESTING VOCABULARY GETS MY VOTE 
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS NOT YET DAD'S ONLY JUST FINISHED IT 
WHY WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT IT'S DULL 
DULL DULL DULL 
YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN LOOK AT THIS 
CAPTAIN CRIMSON LOOKED AT THE ALIEN LANDSCAPE IN FRONT OF HIM 
IT WAS QUITE NICE QUITE NICE 
HI I'M CAPTAIN CRIMSON 
FEARLESS SPACE CRUSADER EXPLORER OF QUITE NICE PLACES 
QUITE NICE DOESN'T REALLY DO MUCH DOES IT 
AND LISTEN TO THIS BIT 
CAPTAIN CRIMSON WAS SO HAPPY HE WAS WHISTLING A LITTLE TUNE 
DAD'S IN A GOOD MOOD SO HE'S MADE THE CAPTAIN HAPPY TOO 
HAPPY I'M CAPTAIN CRIMSON 
I DON'T DO HAPPY 
I DON'T DO WHISTLING AND I DEFINITELY DON'T DO WHISTLING LITTLE TUNES 
COURAGEOUS HEROIC 
WHEN YOU'RE DESCRIBING YOUR CHARACTERS MAKE SURE YOU USE THE RIGHT WORDS 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'VE GOT A BIG STRONG HERO 
YOU NEED THEM TO BEHAVE LIKE ONE ALL THE TIME 
OH I KNOW WHY DON'T WE DRAW THE PLANET WITH TWO SUNS 
THAT'D MAKE IT HOT AND SWEATY 
YES THEN WE COULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE 
WHAT ABOUT BEAT DOWN 
YES BEAT SOUNDS EVEN HOTTER 
WE OUGHT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE HEAT O. K. I KNOW 
THAT'S GOOD WHY DON'T WE PUT STENCH INSTEAD OF SMELL 
I LIKE IT STENCH SOUNDS EVEN SMELLIER 
LET'S THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE WORDS CAPTAIN CRIMSON CHANGED 
THEY CHOSE THESE ALTERNATIVE WORDS 
BECAUSE THEY DESCRIBE THINGS MORE ACCURATELY AND VIVIDLY 
CHOOSING MORE EFFECTIVE WORDS RATHER THAN THE FIRST ONES 
THAT COME INTO YOUR HEAD WILL MAKE YOUR WRITING MORE INTERESTING 
AND GET YOU MORE MARKS 
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT YOU'LL NEARLY ALWAYS FIND A BETTER WORD 
THAT DESCRIBES EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY 
FOR EXAMPLE HOW MANY OTHER WAYS CAN YOU SAY 
EACH ONE GAVE A DIFFERENT MEANING TO JO'S TRIP TO THE SHOPS 
THINK ABOUT YOUR VOCABULARY WHILE YOU'RE WRITING 
DON'T JUST USE THE EASY OBVIOUS WORDS 
BUT BE ADVENTUROUS AND PICK THE EXACT WORD YOU NEED 
AS PART OF YOUR REVISION 
MAKE WORD LISTS OF INTERESTING ALTERNATIVE WORDS AND LEARN THEM 
A THESAURUS CAN HELP YOU WITH THIS 
THIS UNIT WILL HELP YOU WITH SENTENCES AND PARAGRAPHS 
WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO YOUR WRITING 
A SENTENCE IS A GROUP OF WORDS THAT STANDS BY ITSELF 
AND MAKES SENSE 
THIS IS THE TRUE DEFINITION 
BUT WHEN WE ARE WRITING FOR AN AUDIENCE 
WE NEED TO CREATE A VOICE IN OUR WRITING THAT OUR READER CAN HEAR 
AND THIS VOICE WON'T ALWAYS SPEAK IN GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT SENTENCES 
SO IT IS MUCH EASIER TO DIVIDE SENTENCES INTO TWO MAIN TYPES 
MAJOR SENTENCES AND MINOR SENTENCES 
MAJOR SENTENCES ARE THE ONES YOU KNOW ABOUT 
THEY'RE YOUR SIMPLE COMPOUND AND COMPLEX SENTENCES 
THE ONES WHERE YOUR TEACHER 
WANTS YOU TO PUT A CAPITAL LETTER AT THE BEGINNING 
A FULL STOP AT THE END 
AND MAKE SURE THEY CONTAIN AT LEAST ONE VERB 
THESE THINGS ARE CRUCIAL 
AND YOU WILL LOSE MARKS IF YOU DON'T INCLUDE THEM 
IF YOU DON'T WRITE IN PROPER SENTENCES 
YOU WON'T MAKE YOURSELF CLEAR 
AND YOU WON'T GET ABOVE A LEVEL FOUR 
EVEN IF YOUR IDEAS ARE WONDERFUL 
MINOR SENTENCES ARE THE ONES 
WE WOULD NOT SAY ARE GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT 
YET WE USE THEM ALL THE TIME 
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE SPEAK 
IN ADVERTS 
AND WHEN WE'RE WRITING STORIES 
WE USE THESE FOR EFFECT 
THEY CAN BE ONE WORD SENTENCES FOR IMPACT 
FOR EXAMPLE 
OR THEY MIGHT BEGIN WITH AND OR BUT 
WHEN USED IN THE NEWS OFTEN THE VERB IS MISSING 
IT'S FINE TO USE MINOR SENTENCES 
PROVIDING THEY'RE RIGHT FOR THE CONTEXT OF YOUR WRITING 
AND CREATE THE VOICE YOU WANT YOUR READER TO HEAR 
AND USING THE CORRECT PUNCTUATION WILL HELP YOUR SENTENCES 
WITHOUT PUNCTUATION THEY COULD BE IN A RIGHT MESS 
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT'S EVERYTHING ALL THE THINGS 
I BORROWED YOUR C. D. TAPES TWO T. SHIRTS AND YOUR STUPID SURFING 
MAGAZINES THERE ALL THERE 
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG 
MISTAKE CHARLENE 
NO I DON'T THINK SO I COUNTED THEM 
I DIDN'T MEAN THE STUFF I MEANT 
ABOUT YOU AND ME I WANT TO SAY 
I'M SORRY AND I THINK WE SHOULD 
TALK 
THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK 
ABOUT IS THERE ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAID AND ANYWAY 
I'VE COME TO 
THE CONCLUSION THAT BEING WITH YOU IS A WASTE 
OF VALUABLE TANNING TIME 
CAN'T YOU SEE 
I'M TRYING SINCE WE'VE BEEN APART 
I'VE LEARNT THERE REALLY IS MORE TO LIFE THAN SUN 
SEA SAND AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS THAT BEGIN WITH 
S. 
WHAT 
ARE YOU TRYING 
TO SAY CRAIG 
SO WITHOUT PUNCTUATION THE WRITTEN WORD BECOMES A STREAM OF LIFELESS TEXT 
NOW LET'S USE PROPER PUNCTUATION 
YOU WERE RIGHT 
IT ALL STARTED AT BRUCE'S TWENTY FIRST 
I WENT OUT TO THE POOL TO CRACK A FEW BEERS WITH THE GUYS 
WELL YOU KNOW HOW IT IS 
WE GOT TO TALKING 
YOU KNOW ABOUT GIRLS AND THAT 
AND 
WELL I LOOKED BACK 
AND THERE YOU WERE WITH BRUCE 
ALONE IN THE LOUNGE TOGETHER 
TALKING 
CRAIG 
YOU LOOKED GREAT IN YOUR SEXY LITTLE BLACK DRESS 
WITH EVENING LIGHT STREAMING THROUGH THE WINDOWS 
CATCHING THE HINTS OF GLITTERING GOLD IN YOUR HAIR 
AND I JUST FELT SO JEALOUS 
OH CRAIG 
AND I STILL HAVEN'T ASKED YOU 
I GUESS I JUST HAVEN'T HAD THE GUTS 
OH ANYTHING ANYTHING 
CHARLENE YEAH 
YOU GOTTA TELL ME UH HUH 
THOSE HIGHLIGHTS THEY'RE PERFECT HOW D'YOU DO IT 
MINE ALWAYS GO TOO STREAKY 
PERHAPS IT'S MY CONDITIONER 
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WORDS FAIL ME 
THEY REALLY DO 
NOW EVEN IF WE DON'T ALWAYS SPEAK IN PERFECT SENTENCES 
WE DO HAVE TO WRITE IN THEM 
IF WE WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE MEAN 
IF YOU FIND PUTTING YOUR WRITING INTO SENTENCES DIFFICULT 
TRY TO SPEAK YOUR WORDS OUT LOUD IN YOUR HEAD 
WHENEVER YOU HEAR A PAUSE YOU PROBABLY NEED SOME PUNCTUATION 
IF YOU'VE GONE ON FOR MORE THAN A COUPLE OF LINES 
AND HAVE A BIG PAUSE FOR BREATH YOU PROBABLY NEED A FULL STOP 
LISTEN TO WHERE THE TONE FALLS 
AS YOU HEAR THE SENTENCE SPOKEN IN YOUR HEAD 
THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR FULL STOP 
IF YOU WANT THE SENTENCE TO CONTINUE 
BUT DON'T WANT THE FINITE FEELING OF PUTTING A FULL STOP 
YOU CAN USE A SEMICOLON 
BOTH OF THESE CLAUSES COULD STAND AS SEPARATE SENTENCES 
BUT IT HAS MORE IMPACT 
IF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM IS KEPT CLOSE 
THE SEMICOLON IS MOSTLY USED BETWEEN CLAUSES 
WHICH COULD BE EXPRESSED AS SEPARATE SENTENCES 
BUT WHICH NEED TO RETAIN A STRONG CONNECTION 
IF IT'S A SMALL PAUSE PART WAY THROUGH A SENTENCE 
YOU'LL NEED TO USE A COMMA 
IF YOU WANT A SLIGHTLY MORE DRAMATIC AND LONGER PAUSE 
USE A HYPHEN OR DASH 
AND IF YOU WANT YOUR SENTENCE TO TAIL OFF 
OR HAVE A REALLY DRAMATIC PAUSE 
THEN YOU CAN USE AN ELLIPSIS 
THE THREE DOTS 
FOR SALE ALARM CLOCK SUIT HEAVY SLEEPER WITH LUMINOUS HANDS 
HMM 
THERE'S SOMETHING NOT QUITE RIGHT ABOUT THAT ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
IT'S WRONG 
WHO ARE YOU I'M A CONSULTANT 
WHAT DO YOU DO I CONSULT 
I HELP SICK SENTENCES MAKE SENSE 
LET ME EXPLAIN WHY THAT ADVERT DIDN'T QUITE READ THE WAY THE WRITER HAD IN MIND 
LET'S HEAR IT AGAIN 
IT'S ALL TO DO WITH WHERE YOU PUT THE PHRASE WITH LUMINOUS HANDS 
IT'S THE CLOCK THAT HAS THE LUMINOUS HANDS NOT THE HEAVY SLEEPER 
IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO PLACE IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ALARM CLOCK 
GO ON TRY IT 
HURRAH 
DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE OF THESE 
FOR SALE CRICKET BAT IDEAL FOR BEGINNER WITH SOME SMALL CHIPS 
WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO YOU 
WELL 
THESE AREN'T VERY BIG 
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO PUT THE PHRASE 
WITH SOME SMALL CHIPS AFTER THE CRICKET BAT 
RIGHT 
CORRECT 
MY NAME IS THE CONSULTANT 
AND I'VE HAD AN UNSPEAKABLE DAY 
WORDS FAIL ME 
HELLO 
AH 
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THE PLACING OF THE PHRASE 
PEANUTS TO WASHING MACHINES IN RELATION TO THE VERB SELLS 
NOW IF I INSERT THE WORDS ANYTHING FROM 
I SIMULTANEOUSLY REMOVE THE AMBIGUITY 
EVERYONE SHOULD BE HAPPY NEXT 
YES WHAT I THINK I NEED TO DO HERE 
IS REMOVE THE WORD IN 
AND INSERT THE WORDS WHILE STILL WEARING 
THAT SHOULD DO THE TRICK 
CAPITAL 
COMMA 
COMMA 
COLON 
I'VE NO CHOICE HERE BUT TO DO A SEMICOLONOSCOPY 
SEMICOLON 
COMMA 
DASH 
FULL STOP 
CLOSE IT UP 
THERE WE ARE 
THAT SHOULD MAKE DIGESTION A LOT EASIER HMM 
EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME 
WE PLANNED A STORY ABOUT FINDING A MILLION POUNDS 
HERE'S A VERSION OF THAT STORY THAT A STUDENT CAME UP WITH 
IT'S A GOOD STORY BUT IT DIDN'T GET A LEVEL FOUR 
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WAS 
WELL THAT SOUNDED O. K. 
BUT IT ISN'T QUITE HOW IT WAS WRITTEN 
REWIND THE TAPE AND JOT DOWN SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WOULD CHANGE 
THE FIRST THING I NOTICE ABOUT THIS ANSWER 
IS THE SENTENCES AREN'T SHOWN PROPERLY 
WHICH IS ESSENTIAL IF YOU WANT YOUR READER TO FOLLOW YOUR IDEAS 
LET'S START BY MARKING IN THE SENTENCES PROPERLY 
WE COULD USE A FULL STOP HERE 
AND HERE 
WE COULD USE AN EXCLAMATION MARK AFTER A MILLION QUID 
AND A CAPITAL LETTER HERE 
WE CAN BREAK UP THIS LIST 
WITH SOME COMMAS 
AND WE COULD ALSO USE A COMMA AFTER I KNOW 
WE NEED A CAPITAL LETTER AT THE START OF THIS SENTENCE 
AND IT'S A QUESTION SO WE NEED A QUESTION MARK 
AND A COMMA AFTER ANYWAY BREAKS UP THIS SENTENCE NICELY 
THAT'S A LOT BETTER 
IT REALLY MAKES MORE SENSE AND WILL GET A HIGHER MARK ALREADY 
BUT IT'S STILL A BIT CONFUSING 
CAN YOU SPOT WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE MISSING 
IT NEEDS BREAKING INTO PARAGRAPHS 
BACK TO OUR EXPERT 
YOU SHOULD START A NEW PARAGRAPH FOR EACH NEW IDEA 
OR TOPIC IN YOUR WRITING 
WHEN YOU'RE WRITING YOU SHOULD START EACH NEW PARAGRAPH ON A NEW LINE 
AND INDENT IT 
BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T JUST USE TWO LINES TO INDICATE 
WHERE A PARAGRAPH SHOULD START 
THE FIRST PARAGRAPH HERE STATES THE REASON FOR THE LETTER 
THE SECOND PARAGRAPH EXPLAINS HOW STUART FOUND THE MONEY 
THE THIRD PARAGRAPH GOES THROUGH HIS OPTIONS FOR SPENDING THE MONEY 
AND THE FOURTH PARAGRAPH CONSIDERS HANDING THE MONEY IN 
AND THEN FINALLY HE SIGNS OFF 
IT'S AN INFORMAL SIGN OFF 
BECAUSE THIS IS AN INFORMAL LETTER TO A FRIEND 
JUST BY LOOKING AT THIS YOU CAN SEE IT'S BETTER 
AND ALL WE'VE DONE IS PUT PROPER SENTENCES AND PARAGRAPHS IN 
IT'S EASY TO DO REDRAFTING LIKE THIS ON A COMPUTER 
BUT WHEN YOU'RE WRITING BY HAND IT'S STILL WORTH MAKING CHANGES 
EVEN IF THE RESULT IS A BIT UNTIDY 
BECAUSE IT'LL GET YOU THOSE EXTRA MARKS 
A SENTENCE IS A GROUP OF WORDS THAT CAN STAND BY ITSELF AND MAKE SENSE 
IT HAS AT LEAST ONE VERB IN IT 
SENTENCES START WITH A CAPITAL LETTER 
AND END WITH A FULL STOP A QUESTION MARK OR AN EXCLAMATION MARK 
YOU CAN HAVE PUNCTUATION INSIDE YOUR SENTENCES 
SUCH AS COMMAS SEMICOLONS AND HYPHENS 
ORGANISE YOUR SENTENCES INTO PARAGRAPHS 
SO YOUR READER CAN FOLLOW YOUR IDEAS CLEARLY
