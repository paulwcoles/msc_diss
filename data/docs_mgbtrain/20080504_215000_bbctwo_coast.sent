WHAT A GREAT SIGHT AND WHAT A FANTASTIC END TO A DAY ON THE MOORS 
FOR THE NEXT THIRTY MILES I'LL BE FOLLOWING WHAT MANY PEOPLE CLAIM 
IS ONE OF EUROPE'S MOST SCENIC COASTAL HIGHWAYS 
THE ANTRIM COAST ROAD 
BUILT IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTIES 
NO OTHER ROAD IN THE U. K. HUGS THE COAST LIKE THIS 
WINDING ROUND ROCKY HEADLANDS FOR TWENTY THREE GLORIOUS MILES 
IT'S A JOURNEY THAT ALSO CUTS THROUGH 
SOME OF THE BLACKEST MOMENTS IN IRISH HISTORY 
IN FACT IT TAKES US BACK TO THE BIRTH OF THE UNITED KINGDOM ITSELF 
THE ANTRIM COAST ROAD 
LEAVES STRONGLY PROTESTANT LARNE 
AND WINDS ROUND THE SEASHORE 
TO THE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY CATHOLIC COMMUNITY AT CUSHENDUN 
IT'S A JOURNEY THROUGH NORTHERN IRELAND'S SHARPEST DIVIDE 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY YEARS AGO THIS JOURNEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE 
BEFORE THE ROAD ARRIVED 
COASTAL VILLAGES WERE ONLY LINKED BY OFTEN IMPASSABLE TRACKS 
LOCAL LANDLORDS WERE DETERMINED TO OPEN UP THIS COAST 
WHATEVER THE COST 
IT'S A FANTASTIC VIEW FROM UP HERE 
AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY HOW THIS COAST ROAD WAS CREATED 
THE CLIFF WAS BLASTED AWAY THE RUBBLE AND DEBRIS WAS BUILT UP 
TO CREATE A TWENTY ONE FOOT WIDE PLATFORM AND THAT WAS THE BASE FOR THE ROAD 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THESE DRAWINGS DEMONSTRATE 
THESE ARE THE DRAWINGS MADE BY WILLIAM BALD 
THE ENGINEER FOR THE GOVERNMENT IN LONDON 
WHO WERE PAYING FOR THE PROJECT 
IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTIES THIS WAS THE BIGGEST CONSTRUCTION SITE IN IRELAND 
I'VE CYCLED TWELVE MILES NOW 
AND ALREADY I CAN SEE HOW THIS MASSIVE ENGINEERING PROJECT 
HAS TRANSFORMED THE COASTLINE 
THE ORIGIN OF THIS GREAT ROAD LIES IN A TRAUMATIC UPHEAVAL 
THIRTY TWO YEARS BEFORE BUILDING BEGAN 
EVENTS THAT CULMINATED 
IN ONE OF THE MOST SEISMIC MOMENTS OF IRISH HISTORY 
LIKE MUCH OF EUROPE IN THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTIES REBELLION WAS STIRRING IN IRELAND 
TROUBLE WAS NOTHING NEW 
BUT SURPRISINGLY IN THESE COASTAL VILLAGES 
DISSENTING PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLICS WERE FIGHTING ON THE SAME SIDE 
SCOTTISH SETTLERS AND THEIR CATHOLIC NEIGHBOURS 
WERE IN REVOLT AGAINST THE POWER OF THEIR LANDLORDS 
THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT REBELLION WAS QUICKLY CRUSHED 
BUT THE ALLIANCE OF UNITED IRISHMEN 
SENT SHOCKWAVES THROUGH THE BRITISH ESTABLISHMENT 
ON JANUARY FIRST ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED ONE LESS THAN THREE YEARS AFTER THE REBELLION 
LONDON ABOLISHED THE IRISH PARLIAMENT IN DUBLIN 
THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND WAS BORN 
AND RULED FROM WESTMINSTER 
AS THE ACT OF UNION BROUGHT RELATIVE PEACE 
PLANNING FOR THE COAST ROAD BEGAN 
ROAD BUILDING CAN BRING BIG ECONOMIC BENEFITS 
TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE ALONG IT 
HERE THAT MEANT THE PROTESTANT LANDOWNERS 
THOSE LANDLORDS PETITIONED THE NEW U. K. GOVERNMENT 
TO CONSTRUCT THIS COASTAL HIGHWAY 
ACCESS MADE THEIR LAND MORE VALUABLE 
AND THEY COULD CHARGE THEIR MAINLY CATHOLIC TENANTS HIGHER RENTS 
BUT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THE COMPLETION OF THE ROAD 
WAS OVERSHADOWED BY A CATASTROPHE 
THAT WOULD BRING APPALLING LOSS OF LIFE RIGHT ACROSS IRELAND 
THIS MEMORIAL IS STANDING RIGHT AT THE END OF THE POINT 
AND IT SAYS UP THERE 
THAT THIS MEMORIAL IS IMPERISHABLE 
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY PERISHED 
SOMEONE HAS BEEN ALONG HERE AND CHIPPED OFF 
LINES OF SCRIPT 
AND UP THERE IT LOOKS AS IF THERE HAS BEEN A PLAQUE 
THAT WAS PRISED AWAY HERE 
THE LIMESTONE MONUMENT 
COMMEMORATES THE GREAT POTATO FAMINE OF THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTIES 
FOR THREE YEARS BLIGHT DESTROYED THE POTATO CROP 
AND IRELAND WAS LEFT TO STARVE 
THE MEMORIAL WAS ERECTED BY LADY LONDONDERRY 
WINSTON CHURCHILL'S GREAT GRANDMOTHER 
SHE BUILT THIS OPULENT SUMMER RESIDENCE IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT 
THE WORST YEAR OF THE GREAT FAMINE 
TODAY IT'S A ROMAN CATHOLIC COLLEGE 
IT HOLDS A VITAL CLUE 
TO THE VANDALISM OF THE FAMINE MEMORIAL ON THE COAST ROAD BELOW 
THIS IS A REPLICA OF THE INSCRIPTION 
THIS WASN'T ATTACHED TO THE SIDE OF THE MEMORIAL WAS IT 
YES YOU NOTICED IT'S BEEN WRENCHED OFF THOSE BRACKETS 
IT WAS REMOVED IT DISAPPEARED FOR SOME TIME 
NOT BY YOURSELF I TAKE IT 
DEFINITELY NOT BUT IT HAS COME INTO MY SAFEKEEPING 
WHICH ARE THE LINES THAT WERE CUT OFF 
THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING IT MUST BE THIS ONE HERE 
YES YOU CAN SEE ENGLAND'S GENEROSITY 
SO SOMEONE OBJECTED TO ENGLAND'S GENEROSITY 
THEN DOWN HERE WE'VE GOT THESE LINES WERE CHIPPED OFF 
BRITANNIA GAVE HER BOUNTY WITH HER TEARS 
AND BEAR THIS RECORD 
THOUGH IN PHRASES CRUDE OF ENGLAND'S LOVE 
AND IRELAND'S GRATITUDE 
WELL THAT'S CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT VERSION OF IRISH HISTORY 
IT IS PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL IT IS 
IRELAND WAS DEVASTATED BY THE POTATO FAMINE 
NO WONDER IT STUCK IN LOCAL THROATS 
ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE DIED OF STARVATION AND DISEASE 
WHILE NEARLY TWO MILLION EMIGRATED 
AND NO HELP CAME FROM LONDON 
THE ECONOMIC DOGMA OF THE DAY 
INSISTED IT WASN'T THE GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO BAIL OUT STARVING TENANTS 
SO ENGLISH GRANARIES REMAINED RESOLUTELY CLOSED 
AND ENGLISH SHIPS STAYED IN THEIR HARBOURS 
LADY LONDONDERRY DID HELP HER TENANTS BUT THE DAMAGE WAS DONE 
EXPECTING DYING PEOPLE TO SHOW GRATITUDE PROVED DEEPLY OFFENSIVE 
DOES ANY OF THE RESENTMENT 
THAT CAUSED THE MEMORIAL TO BE DAMAGED 
LIVE THROUGH TILL TODAY 
MEMORIES ARE LONG 
AND STILL PEOPLE WILL THINK ABOUT THE FAMINE IN WAYS WHICH 
IN OTHER SOCIETIES THOSE MEMORIES HAVE LONG SINCE DISAPPEARED 
SO IF WE TOOK THIS PLAQUE TO THE MEMORIAL STONE AND PUT IT BACK UP 
NOBODY WOULD TAKE IT AWAY AGAIN 
I WOULDN'T PUT VERY MUCH MONEY ON THAT 
UNTIL THE ROAD WAS PUSHED ROUND GARRON POINT 
THIS WAS THE MOST ISOLATED PART OF THE ANTRIM COAST 
LOCAL PEOPLE STILL CALL IT THE INNER GLENS 
THE INNER GLENS HAVE RETAINED A STRONG SENSE 
OF THEIR INNATE CATHOLIC AND GAELIC ROOTS 
A HERITAGE THAT IS STILL EXPRESSED IN SPORT 
THIS IS HURLING THE OLDEST RECORDED SPORT IN EUROPE 
IT'S SIMILAR TO BANDY IN WALES AND SHINTY IN SCOTLAND 
FOR ME THE ROAD HAS BEEN A WAY INTO THIS PART OF COUNTY ANTRIM 
FOR LOCALS IT'S OFTEN BEEN A WAY OUT 
BACK IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY PEOPLE EMIGRATED TO ESCAPE POVERTY 
IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES MANY WERE DRIVEN AWAY BY THE TROUBLES 
THE ANTRIM COAST ROAD IS STUNNING 
YET IT'S STRIKING HOW FEW TOURISTS YOU COME ACROSS 
IF THIS WAS SAY THE WEST COUNTRY OF ENGLAND 
I MIGHT WELL BE STUCK IN A TRAFFIC JAM 
LOOKING ACROSS AT A MARINA 
WAITING TO ENTER A THEME PARK ANTRIMWORLD 
BUT HERE WHAT DO YOU GET 
EMPTY ROADS AND PEACEFUL BEACHES 
IT MIGHT SEEM ODD TASTELESS EVEN 
TO TALK OF THE BENEFITS THE TROUBLES MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT 
TO THE NORTHERN IRISH COAST 
BUT THIS IS ONE OF THEM 
A RARE UNCLUTTERED STILLNESS
