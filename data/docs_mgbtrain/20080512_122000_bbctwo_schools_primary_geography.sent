HOW ARE YOU 
GOOD TO SEE YOU 
I LIKE TO GO SWIMMING IN THE POOL 
ESPECIALLY COS I LIKE THE BIG WATERSLIDES 
AND WE PLAY IN THE HOTEL 
ON THE BEACH THERE ARE CAMELS 
AND PEOPLE GO WINDSURFING IN THE SEA 
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PLACES 
MEANWHILE EVANGELINE WHO LIVES IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
HAS A VERY DIFFERENT HOLIDAY 
IF WE HAVE A DAY OFF I LIKE TO GO UP THE MOUNTAIN WITH MY FRIENDS 
THE PARTY HAVE A GUIDE TO TAKE THEM UP MOUNT KENYA 
THIS STOPS THEM GETTING LOST OR WANDERING OFF THE TRACKS 
ON MOUNT KENYA THERE ARE MANY WILD ANIMALS ROAMING FREE 
AND IF YOU WANDER OFF YOU COULD BE KILLED BY ELEPHANTS OR BUFFALOES 
THE GUIDE KNOWS ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN 
AND HE CAN POINT OUT THINGS TO THE CHILDREN 
THERE ARE VARIOUS TYPES OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS ON MOUNT KENYA 
DEPENDING ON HOW HIGH UP THE MOUNTAIN YOU ARE 
SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE WATERBUCKS ON THE MOUNTAIN 
HIGHER STILL YOU GET HUGE GIANT BAMBOO PLANTS 
BUFFALOES AND ELEPHANTS LIKE TO USE THIS BIT OF THE MOUNTAIN 
AS YOU GET NEARER TO THE TOP ALL THE TREES DISAPPEAR 
AND THERE'S LOTS OF HEATHER AND OPEN HEATHLAND 
UP HERE THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF RARE PLANTS AND FLOWERS THAT GROW 
SOME OF THEM ARE ONLY FOUND ON MOUNT KENYA 
THE HEATHER IS LIKE SCOTTISH HEATHER BUT MUCH BIGGER 
WHEN WE GET TO A GOOD SPOT WE STOP AND HAVE A REST 
WE MAKE A PICNIC WITH ALL THE FOOD WE'VE BEEN CARRYING 
EVANGELINE IS GOING UP PART OF THE MOUNTAIN WITH THE HELP OF ADULTS 
YOU MUST NOT DO THIS BY YOURSELF 
THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF HOLIDAYS YOU CAN HAVE IN KENYA 
FOR INSTANCE MANY FOREIGN VISITORS COME TO KENYA ON SAFARI HOLIDAYS 
TO ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL WILDLIFE 
THESE PEOPLE ARE FLYING OVER THE RIFT VALLEY 
THE GRASSLANDS AND WATERING HOLES ARE WHERE THESE ANIMALS LIVE 
HOW DO TOURISTS AFFECT THE COUNTRY 
AS THIS SEQUENCE SHOWS ONE WAY IS THAT IT PROVIDES JOBS 
FOR THE PEOPLE WORKING IN THE TOURIST INDUSTRY 
MOUNT KENYA CROSSES THE EQUATOR 
THE LINE THAT RUNS AROUND THE EXACT MIDDLE OF THE GLOBE 
IT'S A GREAT TOURIST ATTRACTION 
COME FOR THE DEMONSTRATION AS WELL AS BEING A FAVOURITE OUTING 
FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE AROUND HERE IT ALSO PROVIDES JOBS IN THE AREA 
I DO THIS EVERY DAY BECAUSE TOURISTS LIKE TO FACE THE EQUATOR LINE 
O. K. 
IF THERE IS NO TOURISM IN KENYA 
I WILL SUFFER AND I STAY WITHOUT DOING ANY JOB 
PEOPLE COME TO CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN AND TO STAND ON THE EQUATOR LINE 
AND THAT MEANS JOBS FOR GUIDES AND SOUVENIR SELLERS 
MY NAME IS EUNICE 
MY JOB IS SELLING CARVINGS TO THE TOURISTS HERE IN THE EQUATOR 
IF THERE IS NO TOURISTS NO GOOD BUSINESS 
BECAUSE NOBODY CAN SELL 
WHERE YOU LIVE CAN HAVE A HUGE EFFECT UPON WHAT JOB YOU DO 
AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR JOBS IN THE TOURIST INDUSTRY 
IF THE EQUATOR WASN'T HERE NO ONE WOULD WORK HERE 
BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE NO OTHER REASON TO VISIT THE PLACE 
IT'S JUST A ROAD IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE 
BECAUSE IT'S HERE THE AREA SUPPORTS LARGE HOTELS 
TO CATER FOR ALL THE GUESTS 
TOURISM IS A VALUABLE PART OF KENYAN LIFE 
BECAUSE IT CREATES SO MANY JOBS FROM THE HUMBLEST SOUVENIR SELLER 
TO THE LARGEST HOTEL OWNER 
TOURISM CAN BRING LOTS OF BENEFITS TO THE LOCAL PEOPLE 
BUT THE TOURISTS AND LOCAL PEOPLE 
MUST LIVE ALONGSIDE THE ANIMALS FOUND IN THE REGION 
RATHER THAN DESTROY THE ANIMALS THEY HAVE TO PROTECT THEM 
NOMADIC PEOPLE SUCH AS THE MASAI 
HAVE TRADITIONALLY LIVED ALONGSIDE THEIR ANIMALS 
THEY MADE THEIR LIVING BY DRIVING THEIR CATTLE GREAT DISTANCES 
ACROSS THE SAVANNAHS IN SEARCH OF FRESH GRAZING LAND 
HOWEVER TODAY THINGS ARE CHANGING AND MANY OF THE MASAI 
HAVE SOLD THE LAND THAT BELONGED TO THEIR ANCESTORS INSTEAD 
SOME OF THEM NOW MAKE THEIR MONEY 
BY ENTERTAINING TOURISTS VISITING THE COUNTRY 
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ARE OPPOSED TO WHAT THEY SEE AS THE DESTRUCTION 
OF KENYA'S LONGEST SURVIVING NOMADIC WAY OF LIFE 
TOURISTS INTERESTED IN WILDLIFE CAN VIEW THE ANIMALS 
WITHOUT DISRUPTING THEIR LIVES AND SPOILING THE VARIETY OF LANDSCAPES 
NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO FIND OUT MORE 
I HOPE YOU LEARNED ABOUT MY COUNTRY AND LIKE IT AS MUCH AS I DO 
GOODBYE
