TELL ME WHAT TO DO TO GET MY LIFE BACK 
LAST THING I REMEMBER IS THIS MAN WHAT MAN 
THE GUY WITH THE HORN RIMMED GLASSES 
HOW DOES IT END NOT WELL I'M AFRAID 
IT'S TIME TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW SPRING IS PROGRESSING ACROSS THE U. K. 
MOST PARKS AND GARDENS ARE BURSTING INTO LIFE 
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THE OAK TREE 
IT'S ONE OF THE LAST TREES TO COME INTO LEAF IN LATE SPRING 
IT'S EITHER THE OAK OR THE ASH BUT IN RECENT YEARS IT'S THE OAK 
WHICH HAS BEEN COMING IN A LITTLE BIT BEFORE THE ASH 
IT'S A FAIRLY GOOD INDICATOR OF THE END OF SPRING 
SIGHTINGS QUITE WIDESPREAD ACROSS THE SOUTH AND THE EAST OF ENGLAND 
THE GREEN DOTS INDICATE THE FIRST LEAVES ON THE OAK TREES 
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE AS WE HEAD UP INTO NORTH WALES NORTHERN ENGLAND 
ON INTO SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND SIGHTINGS BECOME FEWER 
BUT OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THOSE SIGHTINGS WILL BE ON THE UP 
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SOME PRETTY GOOD SPRING WEATHER TO COME 
TODAY WILL BE A CASE IN POINT FINE SUNNY AND WARM FOR THE VAST MAJORITY 
BUT BEFORE WE GET TO TOMORROW 
WE'VE GOT THE REST OF THE NIGHT TO CONTEND WITH 
WE'VE GOT A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD ACROSS WESTERN AREAS 
RAIN TENDS TO FIZZLE OUT BUT COULD LEAVE BEHIND 
MIST AND FOG IN THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
THROUGH THE IRISH SEA AND INTO THE NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND 
BUT IT'S A RELATIVELY MILD NIGHT 
TEMPERATURES PROBABLY NO LOWER THAN SEVEN OR EIGHT DEGREES 
AND ABOUT TWELVE OR THIRTEEN IN LONDON 
THROUGH THE MORNING 
ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
PATCHES OF MIST AND FOG AROUND 
BUT THAT SUNSHINE ALREADY TRYING TO BREAK THROUGH THE CLOUD 
SO PRETTY DECENT START TO THE DAY HERE 
MIST AND FOG WILL BURN OFF TOWARDS THE COAST OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
THINGS BEGINNING TO BRIGHTEN UP FAIRLY EARLY ON 
THERE'LL BE HOLES IN THAT CLOUD ACROSS MUCH OF CENTRAL SCOTLAND 
THE NORTH EAST IN PARTICULAR THE SHETLAND ISLES COULD BE QUITE GREY 
IT COULD BE GREY ALONG THE SHORES OF THE EAST OF MAINLAND SCOTLAND 
BUT FOR MOST OF NORTHERN ENGLAND IT'S A LOVELY START TO THE DAY 
AND FOR CENTRAL AND EASTERN AREAS PLENTY OF SUNSHINE 
THE WINDS NOT PARTICULARLY STRONG AT THIS TIME OF THE DAY 
AND ALREADY TWELVE OR THIRTEEN DEGREES IN THE SUNSHINE 
SHOULD FEEL VERY NICE 
BIT OF PATCHY CLOUD DOWN TOWARDS CORNWALL AND DEVON 
BUT IT WON'T AMOUNT TO MUCH 
IT'S A LOVELY START TO THE DAY AWAY FROM THAT PATCHY MIST AND FOG 
AS WE GO ON INTO THE AFTERNOON IT'S GOING TO BE A LOVELY DAY 
WHEREVER YOU ARE SOME PATCHY CLOUD DEVELOPING THROUGH THE MIDLANDS 
PARTS OF WALES AND NORTHERN ENGLAND BUT IT WON'T AMOUNT TO MUCH 
ALL IN ALL IT'S A LOVELY AFTERNOON 
TWENTY ONE IN LONDON AND IN GLASGOW 
BUT IT WILL BE COOLER ALONG THAT NORTH SEA COAST 
WITH THE BREEZE COMING IN ACROSS THE WATER 
TUESDAY EVENING FINE 
BLUE SKY FOR MANY OF US AND A FINE NIGHT TO COME 
BY DAWN ON WEDNESDAY A BIT OF PATCHY CLOUD HERE AND THERE 
BUT IT SHOULD BE A MILD START TO ANOTHER QUITE WARM DAY 
LOTS OF SUNSHINE AROUND ON WEDNESDAY 
THERE COULD WELL BE ONE OR TWO SHARP SHOWERS CROPPING UP 
BUT FOR MOST OF US IT WILL BE FINE AND DRY GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE 
TWENTY TWO IN GLASGOW AND LONDON 
AGAIN A BIT COOLER ALONG THAT NORTH SEA COAST 
SO SOME PLEASANT SPRING WEATHER OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
KEEP UP TO DATE WITH THAT ON THE B. B. C. WEATHER WEBSITE 
AND OF COURSE SEND YOUR SIGHTINGS 
OF THOSE FIRST OAK LEAVES IN TO THE B. B. C. SPRINGWATCH WEBSITE 
THERE'S THE ADDRESS ON THE SCREEN GOOD NIGHT
