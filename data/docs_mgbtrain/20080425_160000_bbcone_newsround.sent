HI THERE YOU'RE WATCHING 
NEWSROUND WE'RE LIVE WITH WHAT YOU 
NEED TO KNOW TODAY SWIMMING TO 
SCHOOL THE KIDS CROSSING A WILD 
RIVER TO GET TO CLASS 
WHY WE THINK 
ALL DOGS SHOULD BE SHAH 
MICROCHIPPED 
FIRST TO 
THE DRAMA OF MICROCHIPPED THE KIDS WHO EVERY DAY BATTLE WITH 
A RAGING RIVER TO GET TO SCHOOL 
THE CHILDREN IN COLUMBIA IN SOUTH 
AMERICA HAVE TO WADE THROUGH THE 
WILD RIVER TO GET TO CLASS ON TIME 
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE THEIR LOCAL 
BRIDGE WAS WASHED AWAY HELEN'S GOT 
THE STORY THIS IS HOW SOME KIDS 
GET TO SCHOOL THEY LIVE IN A 
VILLAGE IN COLUMBIA THERE IS A 
RIVER BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR SCHOOL 
AND THEY HAVE TO WADE ACROSS IT 
TWICE A DAY THEY CARRY THEIR SHOES 
SOCKS AND BOOKS BUT THAT DOES NOT 
ALWAYS MEAN THEY TURN UP DRY 
IMAGINE TRYING TO WRITE ON THAT 
SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO 
WALK AN HOUR TO CROSS AND WE HAVE 
TO CROSS STREAMS AND SOMETIMES WE 
FALL 
THE BRIDGE COLLAPSED TWELVE YEARS FALL AGO AND HIRING A BOAT IS TOO 
EXPENSIVE EVERYONE HAS TO MAKE AN 
EARLY START THEIR CLASSES BEGIN AT 
QUARTER TO SIX IN THE MORNING AND 
THEY CROSS THE RIVER AT FIVE A M. 
THE OLDER CHILDREN 
HAVE TO HELP THE YOUNGER ONES TO 
CARBON DIOXIDE BUT WE NEED THE 
LOCAL AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO 
SOLVE THE PROBLEM SO THAT THE KIDS 
CAN GET TO CLASS UNDER MORE NORMAL 
CONDITIONS 
THEY HAVE SAVED UP HALF CONDITIONS THE MONEY FOR A NEW BRIDGE BUT FOR 
THE TIME 
IS 
THE ONLY WAY 
TO GET TO SCHOOL IT IS HOPED THE 
COLUMBIAN GOVERNMENT WILL STEP IN 
TO MAKE THE JOURNEY FOR THEM SAFER
