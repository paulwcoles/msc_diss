MOST OF US 
THINK 
AS A WE'D I'LL 
BE ROOTING OUT

DISCOVERING WHY 
IT IS JUFP 
A MIS

A MISUNDERSTOOD LITTLE PLANT 
ZAIFRDZ IS SO SMALL 
I CAN 
GIVE YOU A

THE VERY 
QUEEN IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IT SITS AT THE VERY END 
OF WALES 
AND IT IS NAMED 
AFTER 
THE COUNTRY S. PATRON 
AS 
WELL AS A BEING A MAJOR TOUR ATTRACTION 
IT IS 
ALSO A 
ATTRACTION IT IS ALSO A PLACE OF PILGRIMAGE ALTHOUGH NO ONE KNOWS 
FOR SURE 
IT IS THOUGHT 
THAT SAINT 
DAVID WAS BORN RIGHT HERE 
ON THIS 
VERY SPOT AROUND A ZERO ACCORDING 
TO LEGEND HIS MOTHER FOUND HERSELF 
OUT IN A WILD STORM DURING THE FINAL 
STAGES OF 
HER PREGNANT 
STAGES OF HER PREGNANCY 
AND AS 
THUNDER CRASH 
SHE WENT 
LABOUR AND WHERE THE BOY DAVID WAS 
BORN A SPRING EMERGE AND 
STILL HERE TODAY 
IT IS SET 
TO HAVE 
STILL HERE TODAY IT IS SAID TO HAVE MIRACULOUS HEALING POWERS ESPECIAL ESPECIALLY FOR ILL ESSES 
EYE 
ESPECIALLY FOR ILLNESSES OF THE EYE 
SAINT DAVID 
TO HAVE LIVED FOR 
MORE THAN ONE 
ZERO YEARS 
AND DIED ON ONE 
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND DIED ON ONE MARCH SAINT DAVID S. DAY FOR MORE THAN 
EIGHT INDUSTRIES 
THIS GREAT CATHEDRAL 
HAS STOOD 
HERE IN 
HIS NAME UN IKE 
MOST WHICH DOMINATE THE SKYLINE 
A CITY THIS 
IS HIDDEN 
FROM 
VIEW IN 
A VALLEY THE CATHEDRAL WAS BUILT FROM LOCAL STONE ON 
THE SITE 
OF AN 
OLD R. CHURCH AND HAS MANY 
OLDER CHURCH AND HAS MANY UNUSUAL FEATURES INCLUDING PILL 
OUT 
WARDS AND 
FROM ONE 
THE 
OTHER THE 
BUILDING DROPS 
BY 
METRES 
IT IS THE 
MOST IMPORTANT 
SITE IN WELSH RELIGIOUS HISTORY THE THE REASON 
WE ARE 
HERE 
IS THAT 
DAVID 
OUR PATRON SAINT CAME HERE SOME TIME 
IN THETH 
INDUSTRY 
SOME TIME IN T. H. E. SIX 
H. CENTURY 
AND HE 
CHOSE THE 
ONLY SHELTERED SPACE 
SECONDLY 
HE WAS AT 
THE 
SIDE OF THE 
RIVER THIRDLY 
THERE'S A 
HOLLY WELL 
RIVER THIRDLY THERE'S A HOLLY WELL WHICH 
YOU CAN'T SEE 
NOW 
WHICH YOU CAN'T SEE NOW IT IS UNDERNEATH THE TARMAC 
AT THE 
EAST 
BUILDING 
THAT'S WHY 
HE 
CAME HERE BECAUSE 
OF THE 
SANCTITY 
OF THE 
SITE BECAUSE 
HUNDREDS CAME 
HERE WHEN 
IVE TO TALK TO 
HIM AND HAVE COUNSEL AND GUIDANCE 
AND SO ON 
HE DIED PILGRIM 
THE 
BUILDING BEHIND 
ME 
IS AN 
EXPRESSION 
REALLY OF 
THE 
OFFERINGS OF THE 
PILGRIMS AT A MAJOR 
OFFERINGS OF THE PILGRIMS AT A MAJOR MEDIEVAL PILGRIMAGE SITE TWO PILGRIM 
EQUAL TO ONE IN 
ROME AT THE END 
OF THE 
MIDDLE 
AGENCIES THEY WERE 
SAYING THREE 
AGENCIES THEY WERE SAYING THREE PILGRIM 
EQUAL TO 
ONE TO 
SKWRAOUFPL 
THAT'S WHY 
PEOPLE CAME 
SKWRAOUFPL THAT'S WHY PEOPLE CAME HERE AND WHY IT GREW 
TO THE 
SIZE AND 
GRAND YOU'RE THAT 
IT IS 
IN MEDIEVAL 
TIMES MANY 
OF THE 
PILGRIMS CAME BY 
SEA AFTER THEY LAND 
D. THEY 
THESE 
AN ANCIENT CHAPEL 
LONG SINCE GONE WHERE THEY GAVE 
THANKS FOR 
THEIR SAFE 
ARRIVAL THE 
ALWAYS BEEN 
A DEFENCE NOT 
ONLY FROM 
THE SEA 
FROM 
THOSE NOT 
AS WELCOME AS THE 
PILGRIMS 
OVER THE CENTURIES THIS PILGRIMS COASTLINE HAS 
SEEN MANY 
THREATS OF 
INVASION 
THAT'S RIGHT 
ALL OVER 
PEMBROKESHIRE YOU SEE DEFENCE 
AGAINST POSSIBLE 
ATTACK FROM THE SEA 
SEA THIS AREA AROUND SAINT DAVID S. 
NO XEGS PEMBROKESHIRE IS SUCH A 
RURAL COUNT 
COME FOR THE 
SEASIDE AND THIS FANTASTIC COASTLINE 
COASTLINE BUT THERE'S A STRONG 
MILITARY PRESENCE AS WELL DURING 
WORLD WAR TWO 
THIS STRETCH 
OF WATER 
WAS A BUSY SHIPPING CHANNEL 
ARE SUBMARINE 
LISTENING POSTS AND 
OBSERVATION POSTS 
BUT 
IN YOU CAN 
SEE 
THE REMAINS 
OF THE 
BUILDINGS UP 
ON THESE 
OUT ROPS THAT SQUARE 
ON THESE OUTCROPS THAT SQUARE CONCRETE BLOCK 
WHAT ABOUT 
AIR DEFENCES THERE'S A NETWORK 
AIR DEFENCE AROUND THIS AREA AROUND THE COASTLINE 
THERE ARE TWO 
AIR FIELDS ON SAINT DAVID S. ITSELF 
WHAT WAS 
THAT USED FOR 
THAT WAS 
THE 
BASE 
FOR THE 
COASTAL COMMAND 
ALSO WHERE THE HALIFAX BOMB 
RS WOULD 
TAKE OFF FROM THE AIRFIELD IS OWNED 
BY THE 
PEMBROKESHIRE NATIONAL PARK 
IT IS A 
FANTASTIC NEST 
N. G. PLACE 
FOR 
SKYLARKS SO 
YOU ARE NOT 
LIKE 
HEAR A BOMBER 
BUT YOU 
ARE LIKE 
HEAR A SKYLARK 
WE'LL HAVE 
PROGRAMME 
MORE THAN OOH FIFTY 
YEARS AFTER 
BIRDS 
MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS AFTER BIRDS OF PREY WERE 
OFFICIAL Y. 
PROTECTED BY 
LAW THEY 
ARE STILL 
BEING PERSECUTED 
THE MOST 
RECENT FIGURES 
FROM THE 
R. S. P. B. SHOWCASE 
ARE AT 
RECORD 
AND IN 
SCOTLAND GOVERNMENT 
HAVE JUST ISSUED A HIGH Y. CRITICAL REPORT 
OF THE 
WAY THAT THIS KIND 
BIRD CRIME 
IS POLICED 
AND 
OF THE 
CONVICTION RATES JULIET HAS BEEN INVESTIGATE INVESTIGATE 
INVESTIGATING THE 
OFTEN HARSH 
ENVIRONMENT 
OF THE 
U. K. S. UP ANDS 
WILD AND 
BEAUTIFUL IT ALSO SUPPORTS A 
HABITAT IN WHICH SOME 
OF THE 
COUNTRY 
COUNTRY'S MOST 
EXCITING WILDLIFE 
CAN 
THRIVE BIRDS 
OF PREY 
LIKE THE 
PEREGRINE THE GOLD 
N. EAGLE 
AND THE 
HEN HARRIER 
BUT SOME SPECIES ARE 
BEING SEEN LESS 
OFTEN THAN 
EXPECT 
D. AND 
THAT'S A 
CAUSE FOR 
R. S. P. B. MANY 
MANY OF THESE BIRDS 
ARE ACTUAL 
Y. 
MISSING FROM 
THESE 
AREAS WHERE 
THEY 
SHOULD BE 
MORE VER THEY APPEAR 
TO BE 
LIKE 
BLACK HOLES WHERE BIRDS 
DISAPPEAR INTO 
AND NEVER GET SEEN 
AGAIN MANY 
OF THE 
INCIDENTS OF 
AGAIN MANY OF THE INCIDENTS OF KILLING 
OF BIRDS 
OF PREY ARE 
FROM 
KILLING OF BIRDS OF PREY ARE FROM AREAS OF 
INTENSIVE GAME MANAGEMENT 
THE FINGER OF SUSPICION IS BEING 
POINT 
D. AT 
ROGUE GAMEKEEPERS 
WHO 
STAND 
ACCUSED OF 
PERSECUTING BIRDS 
STAND ACCUSED OF PERSECUTING BIRDS OF PREY WHICH 
TARGET YOUNG GROUSE 
YOU HAVE VAN LOAD HERE FOR YOU TODAY TODAY AS YOU CAN SEE 
NUMBER 
THINGS IN HERE ONE 
ROLLS 
IS TO INVESTIGATE 
SUSPICIOUS BIRD 
DEATHS THESE BAGS 
SUSPICIOUS BIRD DEATHS THESE BAGS CONTAIN DEAD BIRDS AS WELL AS 
CLOTHING GUNS AND OTHER 
TAKEN 
BY THE 
POLICE IN GAMEKEEPERS 
ON A 
SHOOTING ESTATE 
IN SCOTLAND 
THEY 
ARE LOOK 
N. G. FOR 
EVIDENCE 
ILLEGAL POISONING 
OF BIRDS 
SO PAUL WHERE HAS ALL 
OF THIS 
COME 
FROM 
THIS IS 
ALL FROM AN 
ESTATE IN 
FROM THE NORTH 
OF SCOTLAND 
SO YOU HAVE 
SO YOU HAVE DONE A RAID PRESUMABLY 
WE HAVE 
BEEN 
CARRYING OUT 
AN PRAIGTS OVER 
THE 
LAST YEAR 
GATHERING INFORMATION 
A NUMBER 
OF COMPLAINTS 
FROM THE ESTATE 
WHO OR WHAT 
THINK IS 
RESPONSIBLE NOT 
WITH THIS SPECIFIC RAID 
BUT WHAT 
HAVE YOU FOUND IT IS 
USUAL Y. LAND 
HAVE YOU FOUND IT IS USUALLY LAND MANAGERS USUALLY GAMEKEEPERS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESTATES 
BUT THE 
GOOD THING TO REPORT 
IS ALL 
THE 
GAMEKEEPERS DON'T DO THIS ONLY A SMALL MINORITY 
OF THEM 
WHO 
ARE STILL 
CARRYING OUT 
WHAT 
ARE OUT 
OUTMODED WAYS OF LAND 
MANAGEMENT AND 
PEST CONTROL 
IT IS IN 
LISCRIMINATE 
THESE ESTATES I SUPPOSE 
THIS HAVE A CONSEQUENCE 
NOT JUST DIRECTLY FOR THE BIRDS 
THEMSELVES BUT 
IF WE'RE TALK 
POISON 
IS THERE 
A PUBLIC 
ISSUE VERY MUCH 
SO L. HAVE TRIED TO ISSUE GET THAT MESSAGE OVER TO SAY THAT 
YOU KNOW IN ISCRIMINATE 
LAYING OF 
YOU KNOW INDISCRIMINATE LAYING OF LETHAL PESTICIDES IN 
THE OPEN 
IS IN 
ISCRIMINATE AND IT CAN EFFECT 
WILD ANIMALS BIRDS 
BUT ALSO 
PETS 
WILD ANIMALS BIRDS BUT ALSO PETS AND HEAVEN FORE 
ID HUMANS 
YOUNG 
CHILDREN 
PARTICULARLY IS 
A REAL 
ME AT THE SCOTTISH 
WORRY FOR ME AT THE SCOTTISH AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AGENCY 
ALL THE 
EVIDENCE WILL BE 
EXAMINED FOR 
EVIDENCE THAT COULD POINT 
TO THE 
EVIDENCE THAT COULD POINT TO THE ILLEGAL PERSECUTION 
OF BIRDS 
PREY WHAT SORT HAVE COME 
IN TODAY WE HAVE HAD BUZZARDS WHICH 
IS IN 
THE BAG 
OWLS HARES 
RABBITS EGGSHELLS 
HOW LONG 
WILL IT 
TAKE 
YOU TO 
WORK OUT HOW BIRDS LIKE 
THIS HAVE DIED WE DO A BASIC 
PHYSICAL 
EXAMINATION FOR 
OBVIOUS 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FOR OBVIOUS SIGNS 
OF TRAUMA 
THEN WE 
WILL TAKE 
SIGNS OF TRAUMA THEN WE WILL TAKE OUT DIGEST 
VE TRACT 
MATERIAL 
FOR THE PRESENCE 
EXAMINE IT FOR THE PRESENCE OF POISONS THAT COULD TAKE A WEEK 
POISONS THAT COULD TAKE A WEEK BEFORE 
WE DISCOVER 
WHAT ACTUAL Y. 
BIRD MIKE WENT ON 
KILLED THE BIRD SHOW ME 
MORE BIRDS FROM OTHER 
OF SCOTLAND 
THAT HE 
EXAMINED RECENT 
RECENTLY RECENTLY WHAT HAVE 
WE GOT 
HERE 
I 
KNOW 
IS A 
WOOD PIGEON 
BUT 
THIS IS 
A 
IS A WOOD PIGEON BUT THIS IS A TYPICAL BIRD 
THAT'S LAID 
OUT IN 
COUNTRYSIDE TO ATTRACT SCAVENGERS 
AND AS YOU CAN SEE THERE 
IT IS LACED 
WITH POISON SO 
THOSE GRANULES 
THAT 
WITH POISON WE CAN 
SEE ON 
THE TOP 
THERE 
POISON 
IS IT 
IT IS 
YEAH 
POISON IS IT IT IS YEAH THAT'S ACTUAL Y. A SUBSTANCE 
THAT'S BANNED 
FOR USE IN 
THE U. K. 
AND 
YOU YOU 
NOT 
HAVE THIS IN YOUR 
POSSESSION EITHER 
THIS IS 
A GOLD 
EAGLE 
THIS WAS 
FOUND DEAD IN EAGLE THIS WAS FOUND DEAD IN THE BORDERS 
TO BE 
THE SAME MATERIAL 
THAT'S ON 
THAT BIRD THERE 
IT IS 
AN 
INSECTICIDE WHICH 
IS VERY 
TOXIC 
WHAT 
SORT OF A 
DEATH DO THESE BIRDS 
DIE FROM 
EATING THESE 
POISONS THESE 
THESE POISONS THEY 
ARE 
THEY 
DISRUPT THE 
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AND ULTIMATE ULTIMATELY ALL THE VITAL OR 
A. N. S. AND 
PROCESS S. 
OF THE 
BODY BREAK DOWN 
PROCESSES OF THE BODY BREAK DOWN AND 
IT IS COMPLETE 
FAIL RE 
WHAT 
BIRDS HORRIBLE 
HORRIBLE DID THEY EVER FIND 
THE PERSON 
OR PEOPLE 
THAT 
WERE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR EXAMPLE 
FOR THIS THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE 
FOR THIS OF CONVICTION 
RECENTLY 
BUT IT IS 
VERY DIFFICULT TO TRACE THE SOURCE 
OF THE 
POISON THE BIRD AND 
THE BIRD 
THIS EAGLE 
COULD FLY IN ANY 
DIRECTION TWENTY 
THIRTY 
MILES AFTER IT HAS EATEN THE POISON 
BAIT WHAT 
IS THIS 
HERE A COUPLE BAIT WHAT IS THIS HERE A COUPLE OF OTHER VICTIMS 
OF POISONING 
OTHER VICTIMS OF POISONING THIS IS A 
RED KITE 
AND 
THIS IS QUITE 
INTERESTING BECAUSE THESE BIRDS BEING RE 
NTRODUCED ALL 
OVER THE U. K. 
SO 
AS SOON AS THEY 
ARE RE 
THEY'RE TAGGED 
THERE'S A 
RING ON 
THERE AND 
THIS IS ANOTHER 
VICTIM 
POISONING 
IT IS 
THOUGHT THAT BIRDS POISONING LIKE THE RARE 
HEN HARRIER 
ARE 
PERSECUTED BECAUSE 
THREAT 
THEY POSE TO 
GROUSE CHICKS 
IN 
NORTH PENNINES GAMEKEEPER ALAN 
EDWARDS TOOK ME ON THE 
LAND HE 
LOOKS 
AFTER AND 
EXPLAINED THE 
IM ACT THE 
AFTER AND EXPLAINED THE IMPACT THE HEN HARRIER 
COULD HAVE HERE ONE 
HEN HARRIER COULD HAVE HERE ONE PAIR 
OF HEN HARRIERS 
ESTABLISHED 
COULD TAKE OUT IN THE 
ABOUT THREE ZERO GROUSE CHICKS IN THAT 
PARTICULAR YEAR IS THREE ZERO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER THIS AREA 
THAT I 
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER THIS AREA THAT I WORK ON 
IT IS PROBABLY 
SOMEWHERE IN 
THE 
REGION OF ABOUT 
E. ZERO OWE 
COULD BE 
FIVE 
PER CENT OF OUR 
TOTAL INCOME JUST BY ONE 
PAIR OF HEN HARRIERS 
SO 
IT IS A 
CONCERN TO 
US CONSERVATION 
STS SEE 
CONCERN TO US CONSERVATIONISTS SEE NO CONFLICT BETWEEN 
GROUSE MOORS 
AND 
NO CONFLICT BETWEEN GROUSE MOORS AND BIRDS 
OF PREY 
TO 
SEE MORE 
OF THEM 
TIM 
THAT A PAIR 
OF HEN HARRIERS 
CAN 
OUT AROUND THREE ZERO GROUSE NOW IF YOUR LIVELIHOOD DEPENDS ON 
THE BUSINESS 
OF GROUSE 
SHOOTING 
YOU 
CAN UNDERSTAND 
THOSE GRIEVANCE 
CAN'T YOU 
YOU 
CAN UNDERSTAND WHY 
PEOPLE GET UP ET YEAH 
BUT I CAN'T 
PEOPLE GET UPSET CONFIRM 
THOSE FIGURES 
L. DON'T KNOW 
WHERE 
THOSE FIGURES 
HAVE COME FROM 
DO KNOW THAT 
HEN HARRIERS 
DO 
NOT FEED ON 
GROUSE CHICKS 
ALONE 
NOT FEED ON GROUSE CHICKS ALONE THEIR PREFERRED 
FOOD 
IS MEADOW 
THEIR PREFERRED FOOD IS MEADOW PIPPETS AND VOLES THAT WILL ALSO 
OCCUR ON THESE MOORS BUT THE 
MOORLAND ASSOCIATION 
WHICH 
MOORLAND ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS GROUSE 
SHOOTING 
IN ENGLAND AND WALES SEIZE SIGNIFICANT 
NUMBERS OF 
HEN HARRIERS 
AS A SIGNIFICANT A THREAT WE DON'T 
WE DON'T WANT 
HEN HARRIERS 
THEY 
ARE IN 
WANT HEN HARRIERS THEY ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH DRIVEN GROUSE 
SHOOTING IF BIRDS 
OF PREY ARE 
BEING 
SHOT THAT 
IS ENTIRELY 
UN CCEPTABLE 
IT IS 
UN AWFUL AND 
NOBODY 
IS IN 
THE BUSINESS 
CONDONING UN AWFUL ACTIVITY WHEN 
HOWEVER YOU SEE AND UNDERSTAND WHY 
YOU DO IT ONE 
SAY 
YES 
OF COURSE 
IT IS ACCEPTABLE 
WHAT 
WE OUGHT 
DOING IS 
LOOK 
FOR A WAY FORWARD THE R. S. P. B. THINKS 
ONE 
SOLUTION MIGHT BE 
TO PROVIDE 
ALTERNATIVE FOOD FOR NEST HARRIERS THERE 
OPPORTUNITY HARRIERS TO DO 
THINGS LIKE 
DIVERSIONARY FEED 
FEEDING IF YOU ACTUAL Y. PUT OUT 
PREY ITEMS 
FOR THE BIRDS THEY WILL 
TAKE THOSE FEED THEM 
TO THE 
WHICH 
MEANS THEY 
HAVE LESS 
IM 
IMPACT SO 
YOU CAN 
DO TO REDUCE THE IM ACT WHILE STAYING ON THE 
RIGHT SIDE 
LAW 
LAW THE 
MOORLAND ASSOCIATION 
LAW THE MOORLAND ASSOCIATION SUGGESTS MOVING THEM TO OTHER 
SUITABLE HABITATS 
BY TRANS OCATING THE HARRIERS INTO OTHER 
AREAS WHERE 
THEY COULD SURVIVE 
WE NEED 
TO WORK 
OUT WHERE THAT 
IS AND 
WE ARE 
LOOK 
AT 
FOR INSTANCE 
DARTMOOR 
THEY MAY GO 
INTO LOW 
LAND AREAS 
NEED TO FIND THAT OUT AND 
THAT'S THE 
WAY TO DO IT NOT BY 
SHOUTING AND 
THROWING BRICKS 
AND THREATENING MORE 
THROWING BRICKS AND THREATENING MORE PENALTIES 
THAT'S NOT 
GOING TO 
WORK 
THIS WHOM ISSUE PROVOKES PASSION 
ARGUMENT AND COUNTER ARGUMENT AND IN SOME PEOPLE 
S. EYES 
TOO LITTLE 
SO HOW 
BALANCE THE 
DESIRES OF THE 
CONSERVATION STS WITH THE 
CONSERVATIONISTS WITH THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO 
FEEL THEY 
ARE BEING 
UN 
THOSE WHO FEEL THEY ARE BEING UNFAIRLY 
PICKED ON 
AND ULTIMATE Y. 
PROTECT THE WILDLIFE THAT 
IS SUCH 
AN 
ICON 
C. PART 
OF THE 
U. K. S. LANDSCAPE 
ICONIC PART OF THE U. K.'S LANDSCAPE 
THESE DAYS 
TRYING TO 
EARN A LIVING 
IN 
A REMOTE 
RURAL AREA 
IS CERTAINLY 
FAR 
FROM EASY 
BUT A 
GROUP 
OF STAR 
GAZING ENTHUSIASTS 
WHO LIVE AROUND 
KEELED R. IN 
NORTHUMBERLAND HAVE 
KEELEDER IN NORTHUMBERLAND HAVE DECIDED TO CAPITALISE ON ISOLATION AND TURN IT 
INTO SOMETHING 
ISOLATION AND TURN IT INTO SOMETHING OF AN ASSET MY NAME 
IS GARY 
I'M AN ASTRONOMER 
OF THE 
DARK ST LOCATIONS 
IN ENGLAND IF NOT THE DARK ST 
LOCATION TO 
LOOK 
NIGHT SKY 
SO IF 
WE WANT 
TO TURN THAT LIGHT OFF 
NOW LOOK AT THAT 
ISN'T THAT 
FANTASTIC I'M THE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE 
FANTASTIC KIELDER AS 
OM K. A. L. SOCIETY PEOPLE 
KIELDER ASNOM K. A. L. SOCIETY PEOPLE DON'T GET 
A CHANCE 
TO LOOK 
AT THE 
NIGHT SKY 
IN 
THE CITY 
KIDS THINK 
THAT THE 
CLOUDS ARE ORANGE 
NOT 
THAT'S LIGHT 
POLLUTION 
YOU 
A PLACE LIKE THIS 
YOU HAVE THE 
EXPERIENCE TO 
LOOK AT THEM 
AWESOME EXPERIENCE 
THIS IS 
IT SO QUITE LONG TIME TO 
GET TO WHERE 
WE ARE 
NOW 
WE ARE 
PLEAS D. IT HAS 
BEEN A 
LOT 
OF HARD 
WORK BY A 
LOT OF DEDICATED 
PEOPLE 
THE OBSERVATORY WHEN 
IT IS FINISH 
FINISHED VERY VERY SHORTLY GOING 
TO BE 
ALL OUT EACH 
THAT'S THE 
WHOLE 
IDEA OF 
THIS A THIS OBSERVE 
OBSERVATORY IS TO BRING PEOPLE TO INNER 
GIVE THEM THE 
CHANCE TO LOOK 
THROUGH POWER 
MICROSCOPES AT THE 
WHEN 
THE 
LIGHTS GO 
OFF AND 
AND 
DARK LOOK 
N. G. UP 
INTO THIS 
FANTASTIC 
SKY 
IT IS GOING 
TO BE 
IN REDIBLE 
SKY IT IS GOING TO BE IN 
REDIBLE 
SKY IT IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE 
HERE 
WE ARE 
AS YOU 
CAN SEE 
NICE AND DARK YOU CAN HEAR IN BACK ROUND OUR WIND TURBINE THIS 
GIVES US 
THE POWER 
WE NEED 
WE'LL GO 
OBSERVATORY TURN IT ON 
SEE WHAT 
WE CAN 
SEE WHAT I'M 
AT THE MOMENT I'M FOCUSING THE TELESCOPE GIVING IT ROUGH FOCUS 
TELESCOPE GIVING IT A ROUGH FOCUS IT 
DOESN'T TAKE 
MUCH COUPLE OF 
TWID L. S. 
LIKE 
IT IS PRETTY 
MUCH FOCUSED 
THERE NOW MY PASSION 
I SUPPOSE 
AT THE 
MOMENT 
I SUPPOSE AT THE MOMENT IS OBSERVING DEEP SKY 
GALAXIES GALAXIES THAT LIE AT HUGE DISTANCE ALSO 
PHOTOGRAPHING THE 
NIGHT SKY 
THAT'S QUITE 
CHALLENGE ALSO SO TO 
GET 
A VISUAL 
REPRESENTATION 
OF WHAT 
GET A VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF WHAT YOU 
ARE HAVE 
OBSERVED 
IS CHALLENGE 
AND ENJOYABLE WHEN THEY COME OUT AS 
WELL NOW IN THIS 
CAN 
SEE NOW 
THIS IS AN 
OBJECT CALLED N. 
N. G. C. 
THOUGH THOUSAND 
OR THE NORTH 
AMERICAN NEB 
BLAXT THIS IS 
CLOUD 
AMERICAN NEB BLAXT THIS IS A CLOUD OF HYDROGEN 
GAS 
IT IS EVERYWHERE 
IN 
WHEN 
WE GET 
THIS GAS 
GATHERING TOGETHER 
IT 
TENDS TO 
TAKE 
GATHERING TOGETHER IT TENDS TO TAKE ON THIS PINK OR RED TYPE 
OF HUE 
IN 
LONG 
EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHS 
IT CAN BE 
SUCH A 
PROFOUND EXPERIENCE 
I FEEL 
LOOK 
N. G. UP 
NIGHT SKY 
YOU CAN 
GET 
A SENSE 
OF WHERE 
WE CAME 
FROM 
WE ARE 
GOING TO GO 
IS AN 
AWESOME EXPERIENCE WANT 
PEOPLE FROM ALL 
AROUND THE 
REGION TO 
COME 
UP AND 
SHARE IN THAT 
AND EN 
OY 
IT IT HAS BEEN BUILT FOR THEM IF 
IF YOU 
SHOULD BE ANYWHERE 
NEAR KIELDER 
TODAY YOU 
CAN BE 
PART 
OF THE 
OPENING WEEKEND 
NOW 
THIS IS A 
MOST 
IT 
HAS GOATS AS 
YOU CAN 
SEE IT 
HAS LOTS 
OF SHEEP 
AS 
YOU WOULD EXPECT 
IN 
WALES IT HAS HORSE 
PIGS AND 
CHICKENS AND IT ALSO HAPPENS 
TO BE 
THE MOST WESTERLY FARM 
IN THE WHOLE 
OF WALES

PAUL GROSS 
HERBS FOR 
ALTERNATIVE 
PAUL GROSS HERBS FOR ALTERNATIVE THERAPY THERAPY YOU 
ARE ACT 
VELY ENCOURAGING DAEND 
LINES TO GROW THEY 
WEED 
AREN'T THEY THEY 
WEED 
BUT WE 
AREN'T THEY THEY ARE A WEED BUT WE HAVE 
SAINT JOHN'S WORT 
OREGANO THERE 
AND IN BETWEEN 
WE LET 
THE DAEND 
LINES GROW THIS 
TIME OF YEAR 
JUST 
SO THEY DON'T GET OUT OF HAND 
THEM UP 
IT IS A 
MEDICINAL HERB 
USE THE 
MAKING IT 
A TINCTURE WHAT'S THAT 
IT IS 
A 
WHAT'S THAT IT IS A LIQUID PRODUCT IN ALCOHOL WHICH YOU TAKE WITH A FEW 
DROPS IN 
WATER OR 
FRUIT JUICE A LOT 
OF PEOPLE 
WILL 
FRUIT JUICE TRY TO SPECIFICALLY GET 
FROM THE GARDEN BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE 
A 
TENDANCY TO TAKE OVER DO THEY TAKE A LOT 
OF MAINTENANCE 
TO KEEP THEM 
DOWN 
WE LEAVE IT BETWEEN THE ROWS DOWN BY DEG 
ING THEM 
EVERY YEAR THIS 
WE FIND 
IT 
KEEPS THEM 
IN CHECK 
BUT ALSO 
ENABLES US 
TO EN 
ENJOY THE FLOWERS WHICH 
ARE REALLY 
BEAUTIFUL 
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THE BEAUTIFUL FRENCH COMMON 
NAME FOR THE FLOWER 
FRENCH COMMON NAME FOR THE FLOWER IS PIECE PISSENLIT WHICH 
MEANS WET 
THE BED 
AND IT 
DOES ACT 
AS A DIURETIC JENNY 
HAS BEEN USING DAEND LINES 
FOR TWENTY 
YEARS AND 
KNOWS ALL ABOUT THEY'RE 
HEALING POTENTIAL 
HOW LONG 
HAS THE DANDELION BEEN USED 
FOR OTHER PURPOSES THE 
FIRST EVER 
FOUND WAS OVER TWO ZERO YEAR OLD USED USED FOR WHAT IT IS 
USED 
FOR TWO 
DIFFERENT SPECIFIC THINGS THE 
LEAVES HAVE 
A WONDERFUL AFFINITY FOR 
YOUR KIDNEYS 
AND THE ROOT HAS A 
SIMILAR AFFINITY FOR 
YOUR LIVER 
CLEANING IT 
OUT AND MAKING SURE 
N. G. PROPERLY 
ELIMINATION 
IS VERY SUPPORT 
WHEN YOU 
ARE POOR 
Y. 
THE LEAVES HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT ON 
THE KIDNEYS 
THEY MAKE THEM WORK 
PROPERLY 
THEY WERE 
SPECIFICALLY 
USED TO RID THE 
BODY OF TOO MUCH 
WATER 
PARTICULARLY WITH 
HEART FAIL 
FAILURE 
WHERE YOU 
TEND TO 
ACCUMULATE WATER 
NOW THE 
DANDELION 
ACCUMULATE WATER NOW THE DANDELION ITSELF IS VERY SAFE YOU CAN 
TAKE IT 
ON ITS OWN 
WITHOUT ANY 
PROBLEMS AT 
ALL EVEN WITH OTHER MEDICATION 
ALL EVEN WITH OTHER MEDICATION MOST 
OF THE 
DIS 
RDERS YOU WOULD 
USE 
IT FOR 
ARE QUITE 
SERIOUS SO YOU 
IT FOR ARE QUITE SERIOUS SO 
NEED TO SEE A PRAK TICKSER THE NAME 
DANDELION COMES FROM THE OLD FRENCH 
DENT DE LEON 
THE 
TEETH OF THE 
LION 
LOVE IT OR HATE IT 
THERE'S NO 
DENYING IT IS 
A TENACIOUS PLANT DOM 
GAVE ME THE LOW DOWN ON 
SUCCESS 
IS THERE MORE THAN ONE TYPE DANDELION YES 
THERE'S POSSIBLY 
UP DANDELION TO TWO ZERO TYPES NOBODY CAN QUITE ON 
NUMBER THEY MUST ALL 
LOOK QUITE SIMILAR THEY DO SMALL DIFFERENCES IN 
THE LEAF 
STRUCTURE SOME 
OF THEM 
ARE VERY 
JAGGEDY SOME QUITE ROUND SOME 
VERY LARGE SOME VERY SMALL SOME 
ARE EXTREME 
Y. RARE AS WELL WHY 
WHY ARE THEY SO PROLIFIC THEY TAKE OVER 
WHOLE FIELDS WHOLE GARDENS ONE ONE PLANT CAN PRODUCE MORE THAN TWO ZERO 
SEEDS IN 
A YEAR IF YOU IMAGINE 
OF THOSE SEEDS FORM 
PLANT IN A 
SINGLE GROWING SEASON THEY HAVE AN 
ABILITY TO 
TAKE OVER EXTREME Y. QUICK 
QUICKLY AS A CHILD YOU PICK THEM QUICKLY UP AND TELL THE TIME BY SEEING HOW 
THEY 
SPREAD A 
WAY 
THAT'S SPREADING 
THE FLOURS IN 
REDIBLE AERIAL 
DIS 
THE FLOURS INCREDIBLE AERIAL DISBAOURSAL SYSTEM IF 
SOMEONE DOES 
DISBAOURSAL SYSTEM HAVE THEM IN 
THE GARDEN 
AND THEY 
REALLY DIS 
IKE THEM AND WANT TO GET 
WHAT'S THE 
BEST WAY 
CATCH THEM EARLY IF POSSIBLE THEY 
FORM THESE HUGE ROOTS IF YOU CAN 
GET THEM WHILE THEY 
ARE SMALL 
THEY 
WILL COME 
UP EASILY 
THEY CAN BE DUG 
UP 
TO DO IT WHEN THE 
SOIL IS DAMP 
AND TRY TO DO IT IN ONE 
GO 
BREAK UP YOU WILL 
PROBABLY END 
UP WITH TWO DAEND LINES
