I'LL GO FOR STEFAN EDBERG 
O. K. JAMES 
IT'S GORAN IVANISEVIC 
FIVE SET NAIL BITER OVER SEVERAL DAYS WASN'T IT AS WELL 
THREE OR FOUR DAYS YEAH 
COS HENMAN WON TWO 
OUT OF THE FIRST THREE SETS INCLUDING I THINK 
THE THIRD SET SIX TO ZERO AND EVERYTHING WAS POINTING TOWARDS

HE WOULD HAVE WON THE FULL SET AND GONE ONTO THE FINAL AGAINST RAFTER 
EDBERG HAD RETIRED BY THEN WHO KNOWS WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED

HERE YOU GO IN WHICH SPORT 
CAN A GOAL ONLY BE SCORED

THE SHOOTING CIRCLE 
H. M. M. POLO INVOLVES HORSES

SLOTTED THAT IN NICELY IT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER YES HOCKEY 
GOT TO BE INSIDE THE SHOOTING CIRCLE AND YOU WERE THERE CHRIS

HE HAD SOME RATHER UNCOMPLIMENTARY THINGS TO SAY 
ABOUT THE GOVERNING BODY DIDN'T HE IT WAS WILL CARLING

THEY TEND TO COME UP THROUGH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE SYSTEM 
I DON'T THINK HE'D GET TO THAT STANDARD IN THIS COUNTRY 
PLAYING BASEBALL BUT IF HE'S AN EXTREMELY TALL BLOKE 
AS I SUSPECT HE IS HE'D BE IN THE NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION 
GOING FOR THAT UH HUH 
IT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER CHRIS YES
