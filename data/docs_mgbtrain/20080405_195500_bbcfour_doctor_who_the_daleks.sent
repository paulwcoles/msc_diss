HOW MUCH RADIATION HOW BADLY 
OH WE NEED WE NEED DRUGS WE'VE GOT TO BE TREATED BUT WHERE ARE WE GOING TO FIND THEM 
THE TARDIS WILL HAVE TO TAKE US TO ANOTHER TIME AND PLACE DON'T YOU REMEMBER 
WE CAN'T MOVE THE SHIP UNTIL WE FIND THE MERCURY FOR THE FLUID LINK 
FOR THE FLUID LINK YES YES I'M AFRAID I CHEATED A LITTLE ON THAT 
I WAS DETERMINED TO SEE THE CITY BUT EVERYBODY WANTED TO GO ON

SUSAN OH BARBARA THANK HEAVEN WE'VE FOUND YOU ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
YES WHAT'S WRONG I'M ALL RIGHT HE TRIED TO GET AWAY AND THEY HURT HIM CAN'T YOU STAND UP 
NOT WITHOUT HELP THE FEELING'S COMING BACK COME OVER HERE 
HOW ABOUT YOU BARBARA WE TRIED TO LOOK FOR YOU AND THEN THOSE MACHINES CAUGHT US 
THEY TRAPPED ME IN A LIFT IT SEEMED TO GO DOWN FOR AGES 
THEY DIDN'T HURT YOU NO 
IAN WHAT ARE THEY 
I DON'T KNOW 
BARBARA DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING WHEN THEY WERE MOVING YOU ABOUT 
ANY LITTLE THING MAY HELP US 
NOTHING MUCH THEY MOVED ME FROM FLOOR TO FLOOR ALWAYS IN LIFTS 
WHERE WE ARE NOW MUST BE MILES UNDERGROUND 
THERE WASN'T ANY FURNITURE I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT VERY MUCH HELP 
IAN DO YOU THINK THEY REALLY ARE JUST MACHINES 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
WELL I WAS GOING TO SAY DO YOU THINK THERE'S SOMEONE INSIDE THEM 
THAT'S A POINT WE HAVEN'T ANY IDEA WHAT'S INSIDE THEM 
I TRIED TO THINK OF HOW I COULD GET AWAY FROM THEM 
THEN I BEGAN TO FEEL SO WEAK AND GIDDY 
IT'S GETTING WORSE NOW 
I THINK THEY MUST HAVE DRUGGED ME IN SOME WAY 
IT'S NOT THAT 
BARBARA WE'VE GOT RADIATION SICKNESS ALL OF US 
THE DOCTOR'S PRETTY BADLY HIT 
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S RADIATION 
WE FOUND THE GEIGER COUNTER 
ALL THE TIME WE'VE BEEN IN THE OPEN WE'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO IT 
WELL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO US UNLESS 
UNLESS WE GET TREATMENT WE SHALL DIE 
BRING IN THE OLD MAN HELD PRISONER 
TWO HUNDRED DAYS AGO THE RADIATION COUNT WAS NINETY THREE 
IT IS NOW FIFTY EIGHT 
AN IMPRESSIVE REDUCTION 
IT IS STILL ENOUGH TO DESTROY 
OUR PRISONERS ARE SHOWING PRELIMINARY STAGES OF SICKNESS 
WE KNOW THAT OURS ARE ABLE TO LIVE ON THIS SURFACE AND THEY MUST HAVE FOUND IMMUNITY 
PERHAPS IT IS A DRUG 
IS IT FAILING THEM NOW 
WHY ARE THESE FOUR SHOWING SIGNS OF RADIATION SICKNESS 
A FEW QUESTIONS WILL REDUCE THE MYSTERY 
DO NOT MOVE OUT OF THE LIGHT 
SIT ON THE FLOOR 
YOU ARE ONE OF THE THAL PEOPLE 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU WHY ARE YOU SUFFERING FROM RADIATION 
WHY BECAUSE WE WERE NOT AWARE OF IT UNTIL TOO LATE THAT IS WHY 
NO THAT IS NOT TRUE 
WE KNOW THAT THALS HAVE EXISTED OUTSIDE OUR CITY 
THE TRUTH IS YOUR SUPPLY OF DRUGS HAS FAILED AND YOU CAME INTO THE CITY TO SEE IF YOU COULD FIND MORE 
NO NO THALS WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
WE'RE NOT THALS OR WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE VERY ILL 
YOU AND YOUR COMPANIONS NEED A DRUG TO STAY ALIVE 
WE HAVE NO DRUGS 
A DRUG A DRUG 
THE DRUGS LEFT OUTSIDE THE TARDIS 
TARDIS HE IS BECOMING DELIRIOUS 
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HIS WORDS 
YES BUT YOU MAY STAY IN THE LIGHT 
MY FRIENDS AND I ARE TRAVELLERS 
WE DID FIND SOMETHING IN THE FOREST NEAR OUR ENCAMPMENT 
THEY MAY BE THE DRUGS YOU'RE REFERRING TO 
WHY NOT LET ONE OF US BRING THE THALS HERE UNDER GUARD IF NECESSARY 
WE CANNOT MOVE OUTSIDE THE CITY 
LET ONE OF US GO AND HOLD THE OTHERS UNTIL HE RETURNS 
PROVIDING WHOEVER YOU SEND UNDERSTANDS THE REST OF YOU WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS RETURN 
HE WILL HAVE OUR LIVES IN HIS HANDS 
THAT IS ENOUGH THEN WE AGREE 
OH 
TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE 
THE THALS 
OVER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
THERE WERE TWO RACES ON THIS PLANET 
WE THE DALEKS AND THE THALS 
AFTER THE NEUTRONIC WAR OUR DALEK FOREFATHERS RETIRED INTO THE CITY 
PROTECTED BY OUR MACHINES 
AND THE THALS MOST OF THEM PERISHED IN THE WAR BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SURVIVORS 
THEY MUST BE DISGUSTINGLY MUTATED BUT THE FACT THAT THEY SURVIVED 
TELLS US THEY MUST HAVE A DRUG THAT PRESERVES THE LIFE FORCE 
AND KNOWING THAT THESE MUTATED CREATURES EXIST OUTSIDE THE CITY 
YOU'D SEND ONE OF US IN AMONGST THEM 
AS YOU SAY YOURSELF ALL YOUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT 
IS IT ANY EASIER YES I THINK IT IS 
I'M GOING TO TRY AND STAND ON MY OWN 
BE CAREFUL I'LL BE ALL RIGHT 
THAT'S NOT TOO BAD IS IT WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN FOR A BIT NO NO 
OH 
IT'S NO GOOD 
COME ON SIT DOWN IT'LL WEAR OFF IT TIME 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING BARBARA 
OH NOT TOO GOOD SUSAN 
WELL IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE AFFECTED ME AS MUCH AS YOU 
GRANDFATHER ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
OH OH 
WHAT HAPPENED 
IN A MOMENT CHILD 
THE PHIAL OF DRUGS LEFT OUTSIDE THE TARDIS REMEMBER YES WHAT ABOUT THEM 
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN ANTI RADIATION GLOVES 
DRUGS I CAN'T BE CERTAIN 
BUT IT DOES GIVE US A CHANCE 
THE PEOPLE HERE ARE VERY EAGER TO GET HOLD OF THEM 
NONE OF US ARE IN VERY GOOD SHAPE 
I COULD DO IT NO IT MUST BE ME 
BUT YOU CAN'T WALK I'LL BE ALL RIGHT WHOEVER GOES MUST BE VERY CAREFUL 
THE CREATURES OUT THERE ARE THE ONES WHO DROPPED THE BOX 
THEY'RE CALLED THALS THEY'RE MUTATIONS SO IT WASN'T OUR CAPTORS WHO LEFT THE DRUGS BEHIND 
NO IF THEY WERE DRUGS I'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM THE DALEKS THE WHO 
THE DALEKS OUR CAPTORS HERE OH IF I DIDN'T FEEL SO 
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE NEUTRON BOMB 
THE DALEKS BUILT THIS UNDERGROUND CITY AS A KIND OF HUGE SHELTER 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM THE THALS 
HOW DID THEY SURVIVE OUT THERE I 
DOCTOR DOCTOR 
I MUST GET THAT DRUG QUICKLY 
HE'S BURNING HOT YES 
AS SOON AS THEY TAKE ME TO THE SURFACE I'LL ASK FOR WATER 
YOU MUST KEEP HIM AS COOL AS YOU CAN 
I THINK THERE'S SOME LIFE COMING BACK INTO MY TOES 
YOU CAN'T GO ALONE IAN I'LL HAVE TO GO WITH YOU 
NO I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE SUSAN BUT I CAN'T 
DON'T ARGUE WITH ME BUT YOU CAN'T GET INTO THE SHIP ALL RIGHT GIVE ME THE KEY 
IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF THE KEY THE WHOLE LOCK COMES AWAY FROM THE DOOR 
SUSAN SUPPOSING THESE DALEKS INSIST THAT ONLY ONE OF US GOES 
THEN I'LL HAVE TO GO ON TRYING UNTIL THE DOOR OPENS 
NO YOU'D JAM THE LOCK IT'S A DEFENCE MECHANISM 
THERE ARE TWENTY ONE DIFFERENT HOLES INSIDE THE LOCK 
THERE'S ONE RIGHT PLACE AND TWENTY WRONG ONES TAKE A MISTAKE THE WHOLE INSIDE OF THE LOCK WILL MELT 
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE FOR IT 
WE MUST GO TOGETHER 
COME ON LET'S SEE IF I CAN WALK 
NO IT'S ALL RIGHT BARBARA YOU TAKE IT EASY REST 
MY RIGHT LEG IS BETTER YOU KNOW 
OH I'VE GOT FEELING IN THIS ONE 
BUT THE LEFT IS JUST PINS AND NEEDLES 
YOU MUST LEAVE NOW I'M NOT WELL ENOUGH YET YOU MUST LEAVE NOW 
MY LEGS ONE OF YOU IS GOING 
YOU MUST GIVE ME MORE TIME 
CAN'T YOU SEE HOW WEAK HE IS THERE ARE OTHERS 
OH IAN I CAN'T 
THE WHOLE ROOM'S GOING ROUND 
OH M. M. M. OH 
MUST I ALONE 
YOU CAN'T LET HER GO ALONE 
SHE'S JUST A CHILD 
PLEAD WITH THEM ANYTHING 
SUSAN YOU SEE HOW ILL THEY BOTH ARE 
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT UNTIL I CAN WALK 
AN HOUR MIGHT MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE 
I'M SO AFRAID GO ON 
YES DON'T STOP FOR ANYTHING 
STRAIGHT THERE STRAIGHT BACK 
ARE YOU READY 
YES ALL RIGHT 
I'M COMING NOW 
IAN THE OTHERS IN THE FOREST 
HE SAID THEY WERE MUTATIONS 
WHAT ELSE COULD I DO 
OH 
THE CHILD HAS SET OUT 
HER DIRECTION IS BEING FOLLOWED ON THE RADIOSCOPES YES 
MARK HER MOVEMENTS CAREFULLY 
IF THERE ARE MORE THAL PEOPLE IN THE JUNGLE SHE WILL TRY TO CONTACT THEM I UNDERSTAND 
IF SHE RETURNS WITH THE DRUG AM I TO ALLOW THE PRISONERS TO USE IT 
NO THEY WILL DIE IN TIME 
THEIR ONLY VALUE IS IN BRINGING US ENOUGH OF THE THAL DRUG TO DUPLICATE IT FOR OUR OWN USE 
AT LAST WE HAVE A CHANCE 
HE'S GETTING WORSE 
HOW LONG DID THE DOCTOR SAY WE'D LAST WITHOUT TREATMENT FORTY EIGHT HOURS 
I DON'T KNOW 
IT IT'S HIT HIM SO BADLY IAN 
YES HOW ARE YOU FEELING 
OH I. I ACHE ALL OVER 
I HAVE DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING MY EYES OPEN 
YES I'M ABOUT THE SAME 
IT'S ALL HIS FAULT 
HE HAD TO HAVE HIS OWN WAY SEE THE CITY IAN THAT DOESN'T HELP 
OH I KNOW I KNOW WE MUST WAIT 
THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO 
WAIT YES AN HOUR AGO I THOUGHT WE MIGHT TRY AND ESCAPE 
MAKE A PLAN THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE 
BUT NOW WE'RE TOO LATE IF THEY LEFT THE DOORS OPEN WIDE WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO CRAWL THROUGH THEM 
HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN GONE 
ABOUT AN HOUR SHE SHOULD JUST BE ON THE EDGE OF THE JUNGLE BY NOW 
AH HE'S SO HOT 
IT'S LIKE A FEVER 
YES HIS BREATHING'S SO BAD 
WHAT DO YOU THINK BARBARA I DON'T KNOW 
EVEN IF SUSAN GOT BACK NOW I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'D BE IN TIME 
GIVE ME HIS COAT 
HERE YOU ARE 
OH 
BARBARA 
COME ON NOW I'M ALL RIGHT NO YOU REST YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING MORE FOR HIM 
IT'S SO HOT IN HERE YES YOU TRY AND SLEEP BARBARA 
YES I'D LIKE TO SLEEP YES 
SO HOT OH 
HURRY SUSAN 
HURRY SUSAN 
I HAVE JUST COME FROM THE PRISONERS 
THE OLD MAN IS DYING 
THEN HE MUST DIE THERE IS NO HELP WE CAN GIVE HIM 
HOW ARE THE OTHERS 
THE WOMAN IS SLEEPING VERY HEAVILY 
THE YOUNG MAN FIGHTS AGAINST IT 
WHAT OF THE GIRL HAS SHE REACHED THE JUNGLE 
YES THE RADIOSCOPE'S TRACKED HER THAT FAR 
NOW THEY HAVE LOST HER 
DON'T STOP FOR ANYTHING 
STRAIGHT THERE STRAIGHT BACK AN HOUR MIGHT MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE 
MUST 
MUST
