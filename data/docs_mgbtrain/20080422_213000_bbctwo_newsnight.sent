BIG MIGHT BE A DEMOCRATIC 
CONTENDER FOR

AS YET UNDISCLOSED REVELATION OR 
OTHER HOW IS HE GOING TO STAND UP 
TO THIS INTENSIVE SCRUTINY WE HAVE 
BEEN TO CHICAGO WHERE BARACK OBAMA 
HAS HIS POLITICAL ROOTS IT'S AS 
THOUGH HE'S COME FROM NOWHERE 
BRINGING FRESH AIR TO A STEAL 
SYSTEM THE TRUTH IS BARACK OBAMA 
IS THE POLITICAL PRODUCT OF ONE OF 
AMERICA'S MOST COMPLEX AND 
TURBULENT TOWNS 
HE OFFERS THIS 
HOPE WHEN HE COMES OUT OF A 
POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT'S A SES POOL 
THAT'S A SWAMP 
HOLD YOUR FIRE 
CHICAGO THE BLOOD 
BATH IS IMPRINTED ON THE MINDS OF 
MILLIONS BY AN OLD T. V. SERIES 
IT SHOWED THE GOVERNMENT WAGING WAR 
ON THE MOB 
TODAY LIFE'S LESS EXCITING BUT 
MINUS THE MACHINE GUNS AND MELO 
DRAMA CHICAGO HAS ITS MOMENTS 
THREE GOVERNORS AND NUMEROUS 
EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN JAILED FOR 
CORRUPTION THE AFFAIRS HERE ARE 
MURKY AS A FORMER MAYOR PUT IT 
POLITICS HERE AIN'T NO BEAN BAG 
THIS IS THE NATURAL HABITAT OF THE 
CITY BOSS AND PARTY MACHINE YET IT 
IS CHICAGO WHERE BARACK OBAMA 
AMERICA'S WOULD H. P. BE NEW BROOM 
EMERGED CONNECTIONS HE MADE HERE 
BOTH PERSONAL AND POLITICAL HAVE 
SHAPED HIM BUT HAVE THEY LEFT HIM 
VULNERABLE TONY RESCO IS A 
POLITICAL FIXER AND HE'S 
FUNDRAISER FOR BARACK OBAMA IT IS 
A LINK THAT'S AT BEST EMBARRASSING 
FOR THE CANDIDATE 
EVEN HIS OWN 
WORDS OUT OF HIS MOUTH HE WOULD 
SAY THAT HIS SITUATION IS 
PROBLEMATIC SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN 
AROUND HIM 
QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN 
ASKED ABOUT OBAMA'S PURCHASE OF HIS 
HOME IN CHICAGO AND HOW HE BOUGHT 
LAND FROM RESCO'S WIFE NO 
CORRUPTION IS ALEPBLED AGAINST 
OBAMA BUT HE PAID TO CHARITY 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RAISED BY THE MAN FOR 
THINKS CAMPAIGN THIS MAN 
COMPLAINED HOW RESCOE'S ALEPBLED TO 
FIX LINKS TO THE SENATOR 
I'M THE 
FILMER THE NEW KID IN TOWN MR. 
CLEAN I'M HAVING A BUSINESS DINNER 
WITH TOP BANKERS FROM QATAR 
HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING ALL OF A 
SUDDEN OBAMA STOPS BY AND SAYING 
HEY HOW ARE YOU DOING TONY 
BANKERS HERE IS MY FRIEND OBAMA 
HE WILLING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES THAT GIVES YOU 
AUTHENTICITY THAT UNDERSTOOD 
CONNECTION 
SO R. THE TWISTS AND CONNECTION TURNS OF THE TRIAL HAVE PROVIDED 
EMBARRASSMENT BY ASSOCIATION FOR 
BARACK OBAMA HIS OPPONENT WILL 
HOPE FOR MORE AND WORSE IN THE 
COMING WEEKS WE NOW HEAD FOR THE 
SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO IT IS WHERE 
OBAMA WORKED AND WORE SHPD AND 
WHERE HIS PASTOR IS THE PROBLEM 
WITH THE PARISHIONER RUNNING FOR 
PRESIDENT SOME OF THE MORE 
INCENDIARY CERTAIN MONIES HAVE BEEN 
GIVEN INTERNATIONAL EXPOSURE NOT NOT GOD BLESS AMERICA GOD DAM AMERICA 
OBAMA KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A 
BLACK MAN LIVING IN A COUNTRY AND 
CULTURE CONTROLLED BY RICH WHITE 
PEOPLE 
FOR MANY WHITE AMERICANS PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN NEAR OF THE 
INSIDE OF A BLACK CHURCH THE WORDS 
OF REV JEREMIAH WRIGHT COME AS A 
SHOCK THEY KNEW PREACHERS TRADE IN 
HELL FIRE AND DAM NATION BUT 
HADN'T APPRECIATED THAT CHURCHES 
PREACHING LIBERATION AND ANTHOLOGY 
IS WHAT IS DENOUNCED IS THE BLAME 
OF THE WHITES WHAT IS THE ENDURING 
APPEAL OF A CHURCH LIKE TRINYIT TO 
BARACK OBAMA TO PROF LINDA THOMAS 
KNOWS BARACK OBAMA WELL BOTH 
FAMILIES WORSHIP AT TRINYIT CHUFF 
I THINK TRINYIT OFFERED BARACK 
OBAMA A PLACE OF HOME PARTICULARLY 
BECAUSE HE IS THE OFFSPRING OF AN 
INTERRACIAL 
MOTHER 
INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE HIS MOTHER WAS WHITE HIS FATHER WAS BLACK 
KENYAN THEREFORE HE GREW UP IN 
WHITE CULTURE AND HAWAII WHICH IS 
AWAY FROM THE MAINLAND OF THE 
UNITED STATES SO COMING TO 
TRINYIT WOULD BE A PLACE THAT HE 
COULD CLAIM HIS BLACK AND AFRICAN 
IDENTITY IT IS BLACK COMING 
TOGETHER AND CENTRAL POWER WHEN 
YOU ARE AT TRINITY WHITE CULTURE 
IS OUTSIDE THE CHURCH AND AFRICAN 
AMERICAN CULTURE IS INSIDE THE 
CHURCH 
IN A POWERFUL SPEECH HE CHURCH REPUTATED THE REV JEREMIAH WRIGHT'S 
COMMENTS BUT NOT THE MAN HIMSELF 
AS IMPERFECT HE MAY BE HE HAS BEEN 
LIKE FAMILY TO ME HE CONTAINS THE 
CONTRADICTIONS GOOD AND THE BAD 
OF THE COMMUNITY THAT HE HAS SERVED 
DILL JINTLY FOR SO MANY YEARS DB 
DILIGENTLY I CAN NO DISOWN HIM 
THAN I CAN DISOWN THE BLACK 
COMMUNITY I CAN NO MORE DISOWN HIM 
THAN MY WHITE GRANDMOTHER AND ON 
ONE OCCASION MUTTERED ETHIC 
STEREOTYPES 
IT IS A TIGHT ROPE STEREOTYPES THAT OBAMA IS WALKING HERE HE 
WANTS TO MOVE BEYOND RACIAL 
POLITICS BUT ONCE AGAIN HIS 
CONNECTIONS MAKE AMMUNITION FOR 
OPPONENTS HILLARY CLINTON SAYS 
SHE'D HAVE CHANGED HER CHURCH THE 
REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE BEEN WARY OF 
USING THE RACE ISSUE MUST FEEL 
OBAMA'S PASTOR IS HEAVEN SENT AND 
THEN THERE'S OBAMA'S AUTHENTICITY 
IS THE CANDIDATE FOR REAL 
CAMPAIGNING IN PENNSYLVANIA HE'S 
GONE BOWLING VERY BADLY HE'S HE'S ACCUSED OF PATRONISING VOTERS 
SAYING PRIVATELY THAT FAILED 
POLITICS CAUSE BITTERNESS THAT'S 
WHY MANY AMERICANS HE SAID CLING 
TO ISSUES LIKE GUNS AND RELIGION 
QUEUE THE LATEST CAMPAIGN STORM 
ALDERMAN BRIAN DOHERTY IS THE ONE 
REPUBLICAN ON CHICAGO'S CITY 
COUNCIL HE UNDERSTANDS THE BLUE 
COLLAR VOTE THEY'RE HIS 
CONSTITUENTS HE SAYS IF HILLARY 
CLINTON CAN'T CAST OBAMA AS ELITIST 
THE REPUBLICANS WILL 
TALKING ABOUT 
BITTERNESS IT IS ALMOST 
CONDESCENDING TO SMALL TOWN 
AMERICA TO CLINGING TO GUNS AND 
RELIGION IT IS ALMOST ELITIST AND 
SMACKS OF ARROGANCE IT IS ONE OF 
THE PROBLEMS THAT THE DEMOCRATS 
HAVE IS THAT WE KNOW BETTER THAN 
DO YOU THE BIG THING IS THEY'RE 
GOING TO EXPOSE HIM AS A LIBRAFPLT 
AND HIS POLICY AND HIS ASSOCIATION 
WITH FAR LEFT GROUPS RADICAL 
GROUPS EITHER IT BE IN THE BLACK 
COMMUNITY OR WITH THE OLD YIPIES 
AND HIPPIES THE ELITE LIBERAL 
THEY WILL POINT THAT OUT THAT HE'S 
REALLY AN ELITE LIBERAL IN DISGUISE 
AS TRYING TO BE A COMMON MAN ALL ALL FAIR GAME 
POLITICS ANYTHING IS 
FAIR GAME PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE 
GOING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES 
THIS HOUSING PROJECT A STATES DUMPING GROUND FOR POOR BLACK 
FAMILIES IN THE SOUTHERN TIP 
BARACK OBAMA'S YEARS OF COMMUNITY 
WORK HERE HARDLY CAST HIM AS 
ELEITHIST THE COP WHO USED TO LIVE 
HERE SAID THE ESTATE'S KNOWN AS 
THE END OF THE WORLD 
OBAMA TAUGHT 
HERE FOR MANY YEARS HE OFTEN WOULD 
TEACH EARLY IN THE MORNINGS SO WE 
WE WOULD HAVE BREAKFAST OVER THERE 
AT THE OTHER END OF THE WORLD 
OBAMA LEK TUERD IN CONSTITUTIONAL 
LAW BUT COLLEAGUES SAY HE 
SHOULDN'T BE SEEN AS LEFTIST 
ACADEMIC 
HE IS VERY HARD TO ACADEMIC CHARACTERISE SOME IDEAS ARE 
CONSERVATIVE AND HE'S RESPECTFUL 
OF CONSERVATIVE VIEWS HE DOESN'T 
THINK OF AMERICANS SOCIETY IN WE 
THEY TERMS THERE'S NOTHING LIKE 
THAT IN OBAMA 
ANOTHER CONNECTION 
BILL AIRS HE WAS A VIOLENT 
UNDERGROUND TODAY HE IS AN 
ACADEMIC AND SERVED UNCHARITY 
BOARDS WITH HIS NEIGHBOUR BARACK 
OBAMA 
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT OBAMA CERTAINLY THE REPUBLICANS WILL BE 
RAISING 
HILLARY CLINTON RAISED THE RAISING ISSUE LAST WEEK BUT COMPROMISED BY 
HER HUSBAND HAVING PARDONED THE 
WEATHERMAN'S CRIMES 
I WISH WHICH 
HAD BOMBED MORE 
JOHN MCCAIN HAS NO 
RESTRAINTS 
HOW CAN YOU COUNT THAT RESTRAINTS SOMEONE WHO WAS ENGAGED IN 
BOMBINGS WHICH COULD HAVE OR DID 
KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE 
OBAMA SAYS HE 
WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD 
HE BECAME 
FRIENDS WITH HIM AND SPENT TIME 
WITH HIM WHILE THE GUY WAS UNREPENT 
DANT AS MEMBER OF A TERRORIST 
ORGANISATION THE WEATHER MAN 
CHICAGO CONNECTIONS FOR GOOD OR ILL 
THEY'VE SHAPED BARACK OBAMA AS TO 
HIS ELECTABILITY HILLARY CLINTON 
SUGGESTS HE'S NOT TOUGH ENOUGH HE 
ARRIVED AS AN OUTSIDER IN THE 
HARDEST CITY AND WON OVER THE 
POLITICAL MACHINE 
HE WAS BRIGHTER 
THAN MANY OF THEM AND CAME FROM HE 
UNDERSTOOD THINGS IN A DIFFERENT 
WAY THAT MANY OF THEM DID MANY OF 
THEM WERE VENIAL AND NASTY AND 
SHORT THEY NOTICED SOMETHING THE 
MACHINE DEMOCRATS FROM CHICAGO 
UNDERSTOOD ONE THING THEY LOOKED 
AT HIM AND SAW A HORSE THAT COULD 
RUN THEY SAW A HORSE THEY COULD 
RUN AND WIN 
TONIGHT HE'S STILL 
TRYING TO CONVINCE THE NATIONAL 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HE CAN BE A WINNER 
FOR THEM THAT HE'S THEIR BEST BET 
TO BE AMERICA'S NEXT PRESIDENT 
WELL FOR THE LATEST ON THE 
PENNSYLVANIA PRIMARY I'M JOINED 
FROM KATTY KAY OBVIOUSLY HILLARY 
CLINTON AHEAD IN THE POLLS HAS 
BARACK OBAMA DONE ENOUGH TO PUT 
THAT IN DOUBT DO YOU THINK HE'S HE'S TRIED VERY HARD HE'S SPENT AN THE OF TIME AND TENS OF 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS CAMPAIGNING IN 
THIS STATE BUT IF HE WINS IT 
WOULD BE A HUGE UPSET HERE'S THE 
REASON WHY PENNSYLVANIA HAS 
POCKETS OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION 
THAT BARACK OBAMA HAS FOUND IT VERY 
DIFFICULT TO APPEAL TO DESPITE 
THAT ATTEMPT WE JUST SAW IN PETER'S 
PIECE ABOUT TRYING TO REACH OUT 
REALLY TO POOR WHITE MEN I THINK 
HE'S FAILED TO DO SO HE HASN'T 
MANAGED TO BE THE KIND OF CANDIDATE 
THAT CAN WALK INTO A BOWLING ALLEY 
IN PENNSYLVANIA OR BAR IN 
PENNSYLVANIA AND MAKE PEOPLE THERE 
WORKING CLASS PEOPLE IN THIS 
COUNTRY FEEL THAT HE EMPATHISES 
WITH THEM THAT HE UNDERSTAND THEIR 
VALUES THAT'S WHAT IS WORRYING 
DEMOCRATS NOW BECAUSE THEY'RE 
LOOKING AT PENNSYLVANIA AND LOOKING 
AT AMERICA IN THE JERKS AND 
THINKING IF GENERAL ELECTION 
OBAMA CAN'T WIN OVER THOSE PEOPLE 
HOW WILL HE DO IN NOVEMBER 
WHAT ABOUT THE BITTERNESS BETWEEN 
THE TWO IN THE PAST FEW DAYS 
DEMOCRATS IN THIS STATE SAY THEY 
ARE STILL VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE 
RACE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW DEMOCRATS HAVE 
REGISTERED DURING THE COURSE OF 
THIS PRIMARY CAMPAIGN SOME OF THE 
BITTERNESS IS TO BE EXPECTED THE 
REPUBLICANS ON THE OTHER HAND R. 
LICKING THEIR LIPS OVER THIS I'VE 
BEEN SPEAK TO JOHN MCCAIN'S PEOPLE 
THEY SAY THIS IS FANTASTIC NEWS FOR 
THEM THE MORE DAMAGE THAT HILLARY 
CLINTON INFLICTS ON BARACK OBAMA 
NOW THE BETTER IT WILL BE FOR THEM 
IN NOVEMBER IF HE IS THE EVENTUAL 
CANDIDATE THERE ARE OF COURSE 
THE CYNICS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
WONDERING WHETHER SHE'S TRYING TO 
DO JUST THAT TRYING TO INFLICT AS 
MUCH AS SHE CAN ON HIM NOW AND 
PERHAPS HE WON'T WIN IN NOVEMBER 
THOSE ARE THE CYNICS 
THANKS VERY 
MUCH FOR JOINING US 
THOSE NICE PEOPLE WHO TAKE OUR 
MONEY AND THEN SPEND IT ON THINGS 
AREN'T NECESSARILY ENTIRELY TO BE 
TRUSTED TAKE THE COST OF STAGING 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES THE ESTIMATED 
COST HAS MORE THAN DOUBLES FROM FOUR 
BILLION TO OVER NINE BILLION 
ACCORDING TO THE POWERFUL PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS THE INITIAL ESTIMATES ARE 
WHICH DECISIONS WERE MADE WERE 
WRONG IN JUST ABOUT EVERY RESPECT 
ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE WHEN 
THEY CELEBRATED THE OLYMPICS COME 
TO LONDON THE GOVERNMENT WAS BEING 
TOTALLY UNREALISTIC ABOUT THE 
FIGURES AND MISLEADING BOTH 
PARLIAMENT AND THE PUBLIC OVER THE 
TRUE COST OF THE GAMES IN JULY 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE ORIGINAL COST FOR THE 
PROJECT WAS PUT AT FOUR BILLION 
WHICH INCLUDED THREE POINT FOUR BILLION FROM 
THE PUBLIC SECTOR WITH A FURTHER 
SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION PROVIDED BY THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE 
GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE NEW 
COST TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR HAD 
SOARED TO NINE POINT THREE BILLION WHICH 
INCLUDED TWO BILLION FROM THE 
NATIONAL LOTTERY AND NEARLY SIX 
BILLION FROM CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OR 
THE TAX PAYER THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
CONTRIBUTION HAD NOW FALLEN BY OVER 
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO JUST ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION 
THE M. P.'S SAY THE GOVERNMENT FAILED 
TO GIVE A REALISTIC PICTURE OF THE 
FORESEEABLE COSTS BY NOT INCLUDING 
A CONTINGENCY PROGRAMME NOW COSTED 
AT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION TAX AND SECURITY 
COSTS NOW ESTIMATED AT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION 
THE ESTIMATE FOR PRIVATE SECTOR 
INVOLVEMENT WAS DESCRIBED AS LITTLE 
MORE THAN WISHFUL THINKING THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IT WON'T EXCEED 
THE FUNDING FIGURE OF NINE BILLION 
BUT THE COMMITTEE'S NOT SO 
CONFIDENT ONE LABOUR MEMBER 
DESCRIBED IT AS THE MOST 
CATASTROPHIC FINANCIAL 
MISMANAGEMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
WORLD EARLIER I SPOKE TO THE 
OLYMPICS MINISTER TESSA JOWELL DO 
YOU WANT TO APOLOGISE FOR 
MISJUDGING THE COST OF THE 
OLYMPICS 
I CERTAINLY WANT TO OLYMPICS EXPLAIN WHAT THE PRESENT BUDGET IS 
BECAUSE THE I DID EXACTLY WHAT I 
SAID BEFORE WE WON THE RIGHT TO 
HOST THE GAMES I SAID I WAS GOING 
TO DO WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
WE WON THE GAMES WE UNDERTOOK A 
THOROUGH COST REVIEW OF ALL THE 
ASPECTS OF THE BUDGET 
DO YOU 
CONCLUDE THAT YOU DELIBERATELY 
MISLED PEOPLE OR YOU WERE JUST 
INCOMPETENT 
CERTAINLY NOT INCOMPETENT NEITHER 
NEITHER INCOMPETENT NOR NEITHER DID I DELIBERATELY MISLEAD ANYBODY 
NOR DID ANYBODY ELSE 
CHOOSING NOT 
TO INCLUDE A CONTINGENCY FUND FOR 
EXAMPLE IN DEFIANCE OF ALL 
TREASURY GUIDELINES ABOUT GOOD 
PRACTICE THAT IS NEITHER 
MISLEADING NOR INCOMPETENT SO WHAT 
IS IT 
IN RELATION TO THE 
CONTINGENCY FUND THE ORIGINAL BID 
WHICH WAS SUBMITTED TO THE I. O. C. IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR RULES TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
PRICES FOR THE VENUES INCLUDED 
PROJECT CONTINGENCY AGAINST EACH OF 
THE MAJOR VENUES IT DIDN'T INCLUDE 
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT A MAJOR 
ALLOWANCE WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE 
FINAL BUDGET OF PROGRAMME 
CONTINGENCY 
IT SHOULD HAVE DONE CONTINGENCY SHOULDN'T IT 
WELL THE TREASURY 
SIGNED THIS OFF IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE 
INDEPENDENT ADVICE WE HAD AT THE 
TIME DID NOT RECOMMEND PROGRAMME 
CONTINGENCY 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR CONTINGENCY OVERESTIMATE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
CONTRIBUTION WHICH WAS LUDICROUSLY 
OUT THFRPBLGTS WASEN ESTIMATE THAT 
WAS MADE IN THE ECONOMIC ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME BY ONE OF 
THE AGENCIES PARTNERSHIP U. K. WHICH 
ADVISES GOVERNMENT THAT FIGURE WAS 
REVISED 
IT WAS COMPLETELY AND REVISED UTTERLY WRONG 
THE FIGURE WAS WRONG 
OF COURSE WE HAD TO ADJUST THE 
BUDGET IN THE LIGHT OF THAT BUT 
THIS IS RELATING TO THE JUDGMENTS 
THAT WERE MADE FIVE YEARS AGO THE 
POSITION NOW IS THAT THE NATIONAL 
AUDIT OFFICE HAS SAID THAT THE 
BUDGET IS ON A SOUND FINANCIAL 
FOOTING SOME SEVEN BILLION WILL COME 
IN TO STRATFORD L. DON'T KNOW CAN CAN YOU GUARANTEE THAT THE FINAL COST 
OF STAGING THESE OLYMPICS WILL NOT 
BE MORE THAN NINE POINT THREE BILLION GAISH 
TEE IT 
I CAN GUARANTEE IT WITHIN 
ALL THE RISKS THAT WE CAN HUMANLY 
ASSESS AT THIS STAGE 
YOU CAN'T 
GUARANTEE IT 
THE DAY AFTER WE WON 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES LONDON WAS 
ATTACKED BY TERRORISTS AND OF 
COURSE THE SECURITY PROVISION THAT 
HAD BEEN MADE BEFORE JULY SEVENTH PROVED 
TO BE INADEQUATE WE HAD TO REVIEW 
THAT 
IF A BUILDER CAME TO YOU THAT OFFERING TO PUT AN EXTENSION OR 
LOFT EXTENSION FRECTION ON JOWELL 
TOWERS AND THEN HALF WAY THROUGH 
SAID I'M SORRY I WAS OUT I WASN'T 
JUST MILDLY OUT I'M GOING TO MORE 
THAN DOUBLE WHAT I'M GOING TO 
CHARGE YOU YOU WOULD THINK HE WAS 
PRETTY INEPT OR CORRUPT WOULDN'T 
YOU 
IF THE BUILDER HAD SAID TO ME YOU ONCE I COME AND SEE YOUR HOUSE AND 
JUDGE HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST 
TO DO THIS WORK IN FIVE YEARS' TIME 
THEN NO I WOULDN'T SAY HE WAS 
WILDLY OUT THE POSITION THAT WE 
WERE IN WHEN WE BID AND REMEMBER 
MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK WE WERE 
GOING TO WIN THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE AS TO 
WHETHER YOU TELL THE TRUTH THE THE TRUTH HAS BEEN TOLD THROUGHOUT THIS 
I CAN ASSURE YOU 
WERE NOT THE 
PUBLIC ENTITLED TO BELIEVE THAT 
WHEN YOU PRODUCED THE ORIGINAL 
FIGURE YOU GENUINELY BELIEVED THAT 
WOULD BE THE FINAL COST IF YOU'RE 
OUT THAT MUCH YOU ARE INCOMPETENT 
I MADE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR TO THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS BEFORE WE HAD WON 
THE GAMES THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO 
UNDERTAKE FULL COST REVIEW WHY 
BECAUSE WE HAD NO ACCESS TO THE 
OLYMPIC SITE SECONDLY WE HAD NOT 
TAKEN THROUGH THE LEGISLATION 
WHICH WOULD SET UP THE VARIOUS 
BODIES THAT WOULD DELIVER THE 
VENUES AND SO FOR INSTANCE IT 
WAENTS CLEAR AT THAT STAGE IT 
GENUINELY WAS NOT CLEAR WITH THE 
VAT WOULD BE SETTLED 
TESSA JOWELL 
THANK YOU 
NO ONE IN THE CABINET HAS NOT SAID 
WE'VE MADE A COMPLETE DOG'S 
BREAKFAST OF THIS AND WE'RE SORRY 
BY THEIR ACTIONS THE GOVERNMENT IS 
INDICATING THE DESPERATION AND ITS 
EMBARRASSMENT ON THE VOTE IN THE 
FINANCE BILL ON MONDAY THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. INCOME TAX 
RATE WHICH HAS SO INFURIATED MANY 
LABOUR M. P.'S S. NOW GOING TO BE 
INVESTIGATED AGAIN BY A 
PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE WHILE 
NOISES ARE BEING MADE ABOUT 
COMPENSATION DAVID GROSSMAN IS 
HERE THEY HAVE WOKEN UP THAT 
THERE'S A PROBLEM 
THEY HAVE 
YESTERDAY GORDON BROWN WENT TO THE 
PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY AND 
UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE AND SAID I 
GET IT I SEE THERE'S A PROBLEM AND 
WE WILL HAVE A REVIEW TO MAKE SURE 
THAT NOBODY LOSES OUT TODAY THE 
SECOND CHANGE WAS THE CHANCELLOR 
WENT TO A SIMILAR MEETING OF LABOUR 
BACKBENCHERS AND SAID THAT ANY 
CHANGES WILL HAPPEN THIS FINANCIAL 
YEAR SO THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR MANY 
BACKBENCHERS WHO THINK THERE NEEDS 
TO BE A PROCESS AND TIME TABLE IN 
PLACE SO MANY WILL BE HAPPY WITH 
THAT 
WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO BUY OFF THAT A SERIOUS REBELLION 
I DON'T THINK 
IT WILL BUY OFF EVERYBODY THIRTY NINE 
LABOUR M. P.'S HAVE SIGNED THIS 
AMENDMENT IF THEY ALL VOTED AS 
THEY'VE INDICATED AT THE MOMENT 
AND EVERYONE ELSE VOTES THE WAY WE 
EXPECT THEM ON MONDAY THAT WILL BE 
A DEFEAT FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
REMEMBER THOSE THIRTY NINE MOST OF THEM 
SIGN TODAY BEFORE GORDON BROWN'S 
APPEARANCE AT THE PARLIAMENTARY 
LABOUR PARTY AND ALL OF THEM BEFORE 
TODAY'S DEVELOPMENT FROM THE 
CHANCELLOR REMEMBER THAT MANY OF 
THOSE PEOPLE ARE USING THIS AS A 
NEGOTIATING POSITION IT'S DESIGNED 
TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT 
TO SEE THEY GET THE BEST DEAL THEY 
WANT SOME M. P.'S STILL THINK THE 
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO GO FURTHER 
GERALDINE SMITH FOR EXAMPLE NEEDS 
TO HEAR A PUBLIC APOLOGY 
WE'VE GOT 
A LOW PAID PEOPLE WHO WORK IN 
SHOPS AND OFFICES GET UP EVERY DAY 
GO TO WORK DO THE RIGHT THING AND 
THEY FEEL VERY ANGRY SO THERE'S 
GOT TO BE A CLEAR SIGNAL SENT OUT 
FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT YES A 
MISTAKE HAS BEEN MADE AND WE'RE 
GOING TO ADDRESS IT AND WE'RE GOING 
TO ADDRESS IT THIS FINANCIAL YEAR 
TO MAKE SURE THOSE PEOPLE ARE 
COMPENSATED 
ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT COMPENSATED TODAY WHICH MAKES A DEVASTATING 
REBELLION LESS LIKELY THE TREASURY 
SELECT COMMITTEE IS GOING GOING 
TO REVISIT THIS SUBJECT THEIR 
RECOMMENDATIONS WILL COME OUT 
BEFORE THE FINAL VOTE ON THE 
FINANCE BILL GOVERNMENT WHIPS 
COULD SAY DON'T VOTE AGAINST US NOW 
SEE WHAT THE COMMITTEE COMES UP 
WITH THERE WILL STILL BE TIME TO 
VOTE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT IF YOU 
WANT TO LATER THE 
METROPO ITAN 
POLICE SAID TODAY THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
ALONE THEY HAVE FOILED NO FEWER 
THAN FIFTEEN TERRORIST ATTACKS IN 
BRITAIN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WAS THE YEAR THAT 
FOUR YOUNG MUSLIM EXTREMISTS BLEW 
THEMSELVES NEWSPAPER LONDON AND 
KILLED FIFTY TWO PEOPLE THAT YOUNG MEN 
BROUGHT UP IN OUR MIDST SHOULD 
CHOOSE TO BEHAVE LIKE THAT IN 
PURSUIT OF A NOTIONAL RELIGIOUS 
GOAL IS SAID TO HAVE SHOCKED MUCH 
OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY AS MUCH AS 
THE REST OF US NOW A GROUP OF 
MUSLIMS ALL OF THEM FORDER 
RADICALS HAVE SET UP AN 
ORGANISATION TO RECLAIM ISLAMISM 
FROM PEOPLE WHO THINK IT'S THEIR 
SACRED DUTY SOMETIMES TO MURDER 
OTHERS OTHERS WILLIAM QUILLIAM WAS A NINETEENTH CENTURY 
ENGLISH 
WHO TRAVELLED TO 
NORTH AFRICA CONVERTED TO ISLAM 
AND ESTABLISHED THE FIRST ENGLISH 
MOSQUE IN LIVERPOOL TODAY IN VERY 
DIFFERENT TIMES HIS MEMORY WAS 
REVIVED IN ORDER TO RESCUE OUR 
FAITH FROM THOSE WHO HIJACKED IT A 
NEW GROUP'S AIM TO CHALLENGE 
EXTREMIST ISLAMIC GROUPS THOSE 
WITH A POLITICAL AGENDA SADLY SADLY WHAT'S BECOME A DEFAULT FORM OF 
POLITICAL EXPRESSION FOR YOUNG 
MUSLIMS IS THE ISLAMIST RHETORIC 
TIME AND AGAIN I'M APPROACHED BY 
YOUNG MUSLIMS WHO HAVE NOT STUDIED 
MUCH ABOUT ISLAM BUT SAY TO ME BUT 
DOESN'T ISLAM MANDATE THAT WE TAKE 
OVER IT'S THE DEFAULT THAT'S BEEN 
ADOPLTED DUE TO THE VACUUM NOT 
BEING FILLED BY MUSLIMS WHO DO HAVE 
A CONCERN FOR THEIR FAITH AT THE 
SAME TIME ARE NOT DOGMATIC IN THEIR 
POLITICAL VIEWS IT'S VITAL WE FILL 
THAT VACUUM 
BRITAIN'S FIRST 
COUNTEREXTREMIST THINK TANK WAS 
LAUNCHED AT A GENTEEL FUNCTION IN 
CENTRAL LONDON IT AIMS TO FILL 
THAT VACUUM THE LEADERS OF THE 
QUILLIAM FOUNDATION HAVE DIRECT 
EXPERIENCE OF EXTREMIST SEVERAL 
THE FOUNDERS PLAYED A LEADING ROLE 
IN HIZB UT TAHRIR A GROUP THE 
GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED BANNING 
FOLLOWING THE SEVEN SEVENTHS ATTACKS SOME 
ARGUE THAT THE FOUNDATION COULD 
PLAY A ROLE IN WINNING OVER THOSE 
CONSIDERING MUCH GOING FURTHER AND 
BECOMING ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN 
VIOLENCE 
THIS IS COMPLETELY AND VIOLENCE TOTALLY AN ISSUE OF NATIONAL 
SECURITY NOWHERE HAVE WE HAD A 
PROPERLY ARTICULATED GOVERNMENT 
POLICY ABOUT HOW FORMER TERRORISTS 
OR TERRORISTS WHO ARE WAIVERING 
ARE GOING TO BE TURNED AND USED TO 
OUR ADVANTAGE WE'VE DONE THIS SO 
MANY TIMES IN THE PAST LOOK AT 
NORTHERN IRELAND THIS IS SO 
ENCOURAGING TO SEE SOMEONE SEIZE 
THE BULL BY THE HORNS AND PUTTING 
THE ISSUE INTO THE COUNTERTERRORISM 
ARENA 
AT THE LAUNCH THE FOUNDATION ARENA RELEASED ITS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 
UPROOTING ISLAMIC EXTREMISM THE 
EMPHASIS WILL BE ON EDUCATION THEY 
PROPOSE TO TRAIN AND SUPPORT A NEW 
GENERATION OF MAIN STREAM SCHOLARS 
AND LEADERS COUNTER RADICALISM IN 
MOSQUES SCHOOLS COLLEGES AND 
PRISONS AND SET UP REHABILITATION 
AND DERADICALISATION CENTRES IN KEY 
U. K. CITIES ONE OF YOUR IDEAS IS FOR 
REHABILITATION CENTRES HOW WOULD 
THEY WORK 
WELL I'VE BEEN TRAINING 
PEOPLE FOR FOURTEEN YEARS IN ISLAMISM 
EVERY WEEK FOR TWO HOURS A WEEK 
WEEK IN WEEK OUT IT WAS MANDATORY 
FOR ME AS AN INSTRUCTOR IN HIZB UT 
TAHRIR TO TRAIN PEOPLE IN THE 
IDEOLOGY WE'RE HOPING THAT THERE 
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT 
THEY NEED GUIDANCE SUPPORT AND 
EMPOWERMENT OTHERS ARE CONSIDERING 
LEAVING AND THEY NEED ADVICE THEY 
NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT 
IS WRONG 
THAT ISSUE OF RIGHT AND 
WRONG COMES DOWN TO THEOLOGY THIS THIS HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE 
ARGUMENT BECAUSE THE ISLAMISTS HAVE 
TENDED TO PORTRAY THEIR VIEWS AS 
THE ONLY LEGITIMATE VIEW BASED ON 
THE KORAN AND THE WAY OF THE 
PROPHET AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE 
ARGUMENT IS TO SAY THAT ACTUALLY 
THAT IS A NEW AND EXTREME READING 
IF YOU LIKE OF THE KORAN 
IT WON'T 
BE EASY ISLAMIST GROUPS HAVE SPENT 
TWO DECADES ORGANISING RECRUITING 
AN FINANCING IN COLLEGES AND 
UNIVERSITIES IN THE PROCESS IT'S 
ARGUED THEY MOVED EXTREMISM TOWARDS 
THE MAIN STREAM SO WHAT CAN A NEW 
GROUP LIKE THIS DO TO CHANGE ALL 
THAT SARAH KNOWS THE PROBLEMS OF 
WINNING OVER EXTREMISTS AS A 
STUDENT IN LONDON SHE'S RECRUITED 
BY HIZB UT TAHRIR A GROUP THAT 
ADVOCATES A GLOBAL ISLAMIC STATE 
NOW SHE'S QUIT BUT ASKED NOT TO BE 
IDENTIFIED 
FROM THE MOMENT YOU IDENTIFIED ENTER YOU'RE TAUGHT FROM A RATIONAL 
POINT OF VIEW THAT THIS IS THE WAY 
GOD EXISTS AND THE WAY TO PROVE 
ISLAM IS THE RIGHT RELIGION IF YOU 
START TO CHALLENGE THEM THEN 
YOU'RE BEING IRRATION IRRATIONAL 
ISLAM IT'S SPREAD AS A POLITICAL 
IDEOLOGY 
SHE NOW SUPPORTS THE IDEOLOGY QUILLIAM FOUNDATION BUT HER 
HUSBAND AND MANY FRIENDS ARE STILL 
MEMBERS OF H. T. 
YOU HOPE YOUR 
CHILDREN WILL BE MEMBERS YOUR 
FRIENDS ARE H. T. WHEN YOU WANT TO 
LEAVE BECAUSE YOU'RE BEEN 
INDOCTRINIATED THAT THIS IS THE 
WAY TO PRACTICE YOUR RELIGION WHEN 
YOU TRY LEAVE PSYCHOLOGICALLY YOU 
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE LEAVING YOUR 
BELIEF THAT YOU'RE DISOBEYING YOUR 
GOD 
EXTREMIST GROUPS OFFER WHAT GOD APPEARS TO BE A COMPLETE ANSWER TO 
BELIEF FAMILY AND GRIEVANCES 
THAT'S WHAT THE FOUNDATION HAVE TO 
TAKE ON 
TO VIEW THOSE PROBLEMS 
FROM A CERTAIN IDEOLOGICAL 
FRAMEWORK AND SEE THAT BECAUSE I'M 
A MUSLIM AND NOT ANY OTHER REASON 
AND EVERY OTHER REASON IN THE WORLD 
IS NON MUSLIM AND HATE ISLAM AND 
MUSLIMS NEED TO HATE THEM BACK AND 
THE CLASH OF CIVILISATIONS RHETORIC 
THAT ONLY IS POSSIBLE FOR A YOUNG 
PERSON TO THINK THAT WAY WHEN HE'S 
ADOPTED AN IDEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK 
THROUGH WHICH HE VIEWS THE 
GRIEVANCES WE NEED TO TAKE AWAY 
THE NARRATIVE TO SEE THE GRIEVANCES 
SZ SOMETHING WHICH NEEDS POLITICAL 
RESOLUTIONS 
NOW THEY HAVE TO PROVE RESOLUTIONS THEY'RE MORE THAN A THINK TANK AND 
CAN CHANGE THE VIEWS OF YOUNG 
MUSLIMS 
I AM NOW JOINED IN THE STUDIO 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WILL BE ACCUSED 
OF YOU WILL BE ACCUSED OF BEING 
STOUDGEED WHO IS FUNDING YOU 
PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS 
ANY GOVERNMENT 
MONEY 
ABSOLUTELY NOT WE HAVE NOT MONEY RECEIVED GOVERNMENT MONEY DESPITE 
BEING OFFERED BY THE PATHFINDER 
FIND WE SAID IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE 
FOR US L. DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM IN 
PRINCIPAL IN RECEIVING TAX 
TAXPAYER'S MONEY FOR A GOOD CAUSE 
LET'S DISCUSS THE BASIS OF THE JOB 
YOU CANNOT BE AGAINSTED THE IDEA OF 
THEOLOGICAL DEBATE ABOUT WHAT ISLAM 
IS ABOUT 
NOT AT ALL THIS HAS BEEN 
GOING ON FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS IT 
WILL CONTINUE FOREVER 
YOU WELCOME 
THE FOUNDATION 
I WOULD HAVE 
WELCOMED THE FOUNDATION HAS IT NOT 
BEEN FOR CLEAR SIGNS THIS IS 
ANOTHER NEW CONSERVATIVE THINK TANK 
YOU SAID YOU WELCOME DEBATE YES YES THIS FOUNDATION AND WHAT WE KNOW 
ABOUT IT IS FROM WHAT ED HUSAIN HAS 
SAID ALL ALONG IT IS INTENDED AT 
EXCLUDING MUSLIMS WHO DISAGREE WITH 
WHAT ED HUSAIN AND HIS COLLEAGUES 
BELIEVE TO BE WHAT ISLAM IS ABOUT 
THIS IS THINK TANK WE EMPLOY 
PEOPLE IT IS THEIR JOB TO 
CHARACTERISE THE TINK TANK BY ONE 
PERSON'S VIEWS IS STRANGE YOU ARE 
HERE SITTING TALKING TO ME WHAT 
ABOUT MY VIEWS AS DIRECTOR OF THE 
QUILLIAM BOTH ARE PEDALLING THE 
CLASH OF CIVILISATIONS T. NEO 
CONSERVATIVES AS WELL AS THE 
ISLAMISTS BOTH NEED TO BE 
CHALLENGED I DON'T BELIEVE YOU ARE 
ABLE TO PINPOINT ONE VIEW OF MINE 
WHICH IS CONSERVATIVE 
I KNOW 
NOTHING ABOUT YOUR VIEWS 
HE IS THE 
DIRECTOR OF THE FOUNDATION YOU HAVE 
SAID IS NEO CONSERVATIVE 
ED HUSAIN 
HAS SPOKE ON THE THE MEDIA WHO HAS 
BEEN QUOTED AS SAYING ALL SORT OF 
THINGS LIKE FOR INSTANCE 
APPLAUSING PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM 
COMING TO THIS COUNTRY LIKE 
CONDEMNING HAMAS IN PALESTINIAN 
THESE ARE NEO CONSERVATIVE IDEAS 
LET ME ASK YOU CONCRETE QUESTION 
DO YOU ACCEPT THERE IS A PROBLEM 
WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM IF 
SOME YOUNG PEOPLE THINK THAT THE 
ONLY WAY LEGITIMATELY TO EXPRESS IT 
IS TO BLOW THEMSELVES UP SOME SOME MUSLIMS MAY INTERPRET ISLAM WRONGLY 
OF COURSE 
DO YOU ACCEPT THERE IS A 
POTENTIAL PROBLEM 
THERE IS 
IT IS 
PERFECTLY REASON FOR IT TO BE 
EXPLORED 
THIS HAS TO BE DONE FROM EXPLORED WITHIN ISLAM AND NOT SUPPORTED BY 
THE LIKES OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
HAILED THIS PROJECT NEO 
CONSERVATIVES PEOPLE 
ARE YOU 
SAYING HE IS NOT YOU 
FOR 
YOURSELF 
I AM A MUSLIM L. AM STILL YOURSELF COMMITTED AND FAITHLE BELIEVER L. 
HAVE SERVED TIME IN PRISON FOR WHAT 
I THOUGHT WAS MY CORRECT 
UNDERSTANDING I BELIEVE THAT ISLAM 
STANDS UP FOR JUSTICE AND CORRECT 
OUR MISTAKES WHEN WE BELIEVE WE ARE 
WRONG WE HAVE TO SAY WE ARE WRONG 
WHAT ONE OF MY VIEWS ARE NEO 
CONSERVATIVE YOU ARE LEVYING A 
CHARGE AGAINST ME L. AM SAYING IS 
THE PROBLEM THAT ISLAMISTS SUFFER 
FROM WHEN THEY POLARISE THE WORBLD 
AND SAY IT IS ONE OF NON MUSLIMS 
VERSES MUSLIMS THE LAND OF WAR AND 
THE WAR OF PEACE THAT IS THE SAME 
AS NEO CONSERVATIVE RHETORIC WHICH 
ONE OF MY VIEWS ARE NEO 
CONSERVATIVES I FIND IT STRANGE 
YOU ARE SAYING THIS ED HUSAIN IS 
NOT ASSOCIATED EVERY TIME WITH THE 
FOUND YAILGS L. HAVE SPOKEN AS THE 
QUILLIAM DIRECTOR ED HUSAIN HAS 
HE IS NEO CONSERVATIVE HE HAS 
ATTACKED THE CONSERVATIVES 
SO IS 
PADDY ASHDOWN SO IS THE HEAD OF 
DEM MASS SO ARE OTHERS ARE THEY 
NEO CONS AS WELL 
DOCTOR HUSAIN IS ANOTHER ONE OF OUR 
ADVISERS YO R. U. PICKING ON ONE OUT 
OF TWELVE 
ED HUSAIN HAS WAGED WAR ON 
THE MUSLIMS THERE ARE MUSLIMS WHO 
WAGE WAR AGAINST ISLAM THE PEOPLE 
WHO IMPRISONED YOU IN EGYPT THE 
PEOPLE WHO PERSECUTED IN EGYPT ARE 
OPPRESSING THE ISLAMISTS YOU ARE 
ATTACKING AT THE MOMENT 
THIS IS THE 
PROBLEM THEY MERGE POLITICS AND 
RELIGION ANYONE WHO OPPOSES MEANS 
HE IS AT WAR WITH ISLAM HOW IS ED 
HUSAIN AT WAR BECAUSE HE CRITICISED 
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BLOW THEMSELVES 
UP AT PALESTINIAN HOW IS ED HUSAIN 
AGAINST WAR AGAINST ISLAM FOR 
CRITICISING THAT VIEW 
THAT IS EXACTLY MY POINT FOR YOU 
NOW YOU ARE ACTUALLY DEFENDING THE 
ZIONISTS IN AN ISLAMIC RULE YOU 
WANT TO COMBINE ALL ACTS OF 
TERRORISM OF VIOLENCE TOGETHER AS 
IF THEY ARE THE SAME THE DEFENCE 
OF PALESTINIAN IS LEGITIMATE IT IS 
A RESISTANCE AGAINST OCCUPATION IT 
IS DIFRPBTS FROM SEVEN ELEVENTHS DIFFERENT 
FROM SEVEN ELEVENTHS YOUR GROUP IS AIDEING 
THE NEO CONSERVATIVES BY LUMPING 
THEM TOGETHER IN ONE BASKET 
ONE OF 
ONE OF THOSE YOU NAMED PEOPLE LIKE 
PADDY ASHDOWN PEOPLE LIKE TIMOTHY 
GARTON ASH WHO SPOKE TODAY NONE 
OF THEM ARE NEO CONS 
YOUR GROUP 
IS ATTACKING THE MOST ENLIGHTENED 
SCHOLARS IN THE WORLD THAT MATTERS 
TO ME WHEN AN AUTHORITY IS 
ATTACKED BY YOUR GROUP THEN YOU 
HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH THE 
ISRAELIS AND THE ZIONISTS 
I CAN 
SEE WHERE IT IS GOING LET'S LET'S REVISIT THIS WHEN YOU HAVE HAD MORE 
TIME TO SEE WHAT THE FOUNDATION 
DOES COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME 
HAS LAP DANCING BECOME SOCIALLY 
ACCEPTABLE ACCEPTABLE BEFORE THAT A ROUND UP OF TODAY'S 
NEWS ALISTAIR DARLING HAS MET 
FIGURES FROM THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY 
TO PERSUADE THEM TO PASS ON CUTS TO 
HOME OWNERS HE ASKED THEM TO DO 
MORE FOR WOULD BE BORROWERS AND FOR 
PEOPLE WHO FALL BEHIND THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS ORDERED A REVIEW FOR 
THE SYSTEM WHICH REGULATES 
BRITAIN'S AIRPORTS THE COMPETITION 
COMMISSION HAS INDICATED IT MAY 
BREAK UP THE MONOPOLY B. A. A. HOLDS 
OVER LONDON'S BIGGEST AIRPORTS AND 
THOSE IN SCOTLAND LIVERPOOL AND 
CHELSEA DRAW ONE TO ONE AT ANFIELD 
CHELSEA DREW LEVEL IN INJURY TIME 
COURTESY OF AN OWN GOAL 
WHEN THE OBITUARY OF THIS 
GOVERNMENT IS WRITTEN IT WILL BE 
FOUND IN THE MILLENNIUM SOMME 
SUPERCASINOS AND YOU KNOW THAT PUB 
DOWN THE ROAD WHICH HAS TURNED 
INTO A LAP DANCING PALACE THAT ONE 
TOO THERE HAVE BEEN A SIXTY PER CENT INCREASE 
IN SUCH PLACES SO NOW PLACES LIKE 
STOURBRIDGE IN THE WEST MIDLANDS 
CAN BOOST TWO PUBS AND YET FIVE LAP 
DANCING CLUBS IT REFLECTS HOW 
BRITAIN 
HAS CHANGED 
TODAY A 
CAMPAIGN BEGAN TO MAKE IT HARDER 
FOR SUCH CLUBS TO OPEN 
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN EXOTIC CLUBS 
WERE JUST THAT A RARE THING 
CONFINED TO BIG CITIES AND THEIR 
SLEAZEY DISTRICTS NOW THEY ARE 
GOING MAINSTREAM THANKS TO THE 
MASSIVE GROWTH OF LAP DANCING 
ALONG THIS ONE MILE STRETCH OF ROAD 
IN HACKNEY IN EAST LONDON THERE ARE 
FIVE LAP DANCING CLUBS IT IS 
ESTIMATED THE ACROSS THE U. K. IT HAS 
DAUBLED TO THREE HUNDRED THE REASON IS THE 
TWO THOUSAND THREE LICENSING ACT WHICH HAS PUT 
LAP DANCING CLUBS IN THE SAME 
CATEGORY AS BARS AND PUBS ING IT 
EASIER TO GET A LICENSE AND HARDER 
FOR LOCALS TO OBJECT 
IF A LAP 
DANCING CLUB WANTS TO OPEN IT HAS 
TO GET A PREMISE LICENSE TO SELL 
MUSIC AND ALCOHOL ONCE THEY HAVE 
GOT THAT LICENSE THEY CANNOT BE 
CONSIDERED AS A SEX ENCOUNTERED 
ESTABLISHMENT DESPITE OFFERING 
ENTERTAINMENT IT IS NOT GOOD 
ENOUGH THAT LAP DANCING CLUBS ARE 
LICENSED IN THE SAME WAY AS A CAFE 
OR CARRY YOLK I CAN NIGHT CARRY CARRY OCK KI NIGHT THE INDUSTRY IS READY 
FOR A FIGHT THE BOSS OF THIS LAP 
DANCING CHAIN RECKONS THERE ARE 
ENOUGH CONTROLS ALREADY 
SINCE THE 
TWO THOUSAND THREE ACT IT IS EASIER TO OBTAIN A 
PREMISES LICENSE SINCE THAT ACT 
CAME INTO FORCE IT IS EASIER FOR 
THE POLICE AND THE COUNCIL TO 
EFFECT A REVIEW OF ANY LICENSE 
WHERE THEY THINK THERE HAS BEEN A 
PROBLEM OR AN OPERATOR 
WHY ARE 
SOME LOCAL AUTHORITIES SAYING THEY 
ARE FINDING IT HARD TO CONTROL 
THESE CLUBS 
NONE OF THE 
AUTHORITIES I HAVE SPOKEN TO I 
SPOKE TO A LICENSING OFFICER FOR 
SOUTHAMPTON YESTERDAY HE SAID HE 
DOES NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH OUR 
INDUSTRY OR THE WAY THAT WE AND 
ANOTHER OPERATOR OPERATE THEY DO 
NOT CAUSE ANY PROBLEM 
BUT THE 
CAMPAIGNERS FOR A CHANGE IN THE LAW 
HAVE A MUCH MORE SERIOUS ALLEGATION 
TO MAKE THE CLAIM IS THAT LAP 
DANCING CAN LEAD TO THE 
EXPLOITATION OF WOMEN IN SOME 
CLUBS THEY ARE POORLY PAID SO THEY 
ARE LOURED INTO PROVIDING SEXUAL 
SERVICES THEY BECOME EMBROILED IN 
PROSTITUTION 
EVIDENCE FOR TWO THOUSAND FOUR WAS PROSTITUTION CARRIED OUT IN CLUBS ACROSS THE U. K. 
N. SCOTLAND AND LONDON AND 
BIRMINGHAM THAT SHOWED THAT CLUBS 
OPERATE IN A WAY WHICH MEANS THAT 
HIGH LEVELS OF FINANCIAL AND SEXUAL 
EXPLOITATION ARE NOT UNCOMMON YOU YOU COULD SPEAK TO ANY OF ONE OF OUR 
DANCERS WITHIN OUR CLUBS AND WITHIN 
THE INDUSTRY WITH ANY OF THE MAIN 
OPERATORS THEY WOULD BE HORRIFIED 
AND OFFENDED THAT THERE IS 
EXPLOITATION 
SO WE SPOKE TO AN EXPLOITATION EMPLOYEE 
WE MEET UP OUTSIDE OF EMPLOYEE WORK HAVE COFFEES TOGETHER WE ARE 
A CLOSE FAMILY AS FAR AS MY 
KNOWLEDGE I CAN NOT SEE ANY 
EXPLOITATION NOT OF ANYONE WHO 
WORKFORCE THIS COMPANY 
DO YOU 
THINK OTHER CLUBS MAY BE DIFFERENT 
UNFORTUNATELY YES POSSIBLY THE THE CAMPAIGNERS' NEXT MOVE IS A PRIVATE 
MEMBER'S BILL TO TRY AND PUT ONE OF 
THE NEWEST PROOF FEGSS UNDER 
CONTROL LIKE THE OLDIEST CELIA 
BARLOW WAS INVOLVED IN THE LAUNCH 
OF CAMPAIGN AGAINST LAP DANCING 
ESTABLISHMENTS SIMON WARR IS CO 
OWNER OF THE SPEARMINT RHINO CHAIN 
WHY HAS THIS BUSINESS BEEN ABLE TO 
EXPAND IN THE WAY IT HAS 
ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE THIS BUSINESS 
FULFILS ALL THE CRITERIA WITHIN THE 
NEW LICENSING LAW OF TWO THOUSAND THREE THE MAIN 
BEING PREVENTION OF CRIME AND 
DISORDER HEALTH AND SAFETY AND 
PREVENTION OF HARM TO CHILDREN 
THERE YOU ARE YOUR GOVERNMENT 
PASSED THE LAW WHICH MADE IT 
POSSIBLE THE WOMEN AND MEN ARE 
WILLING PARTICIPANTS WHAT IS YOUR 
PROBLEM WITH IT 
ONE IS THE EFFECT 
ON THE SURROUNDING LOCALITY WHAT 
THE TWO THOUSAND THREE ACT DID WAS PUT THE 
LICENSING OF PREMISES ON THE SAME 
PAR AS A BALLET CLUB ANY KIND OF 
ENTERTAINMENT VENUE WHEREAS FOR 
EXAMPLE SEX CINEMAS OR SEX SHOPS 
ARE SEEN SEPARATELY AND LOOKED AT 
IN A DIFFERENT WAY 
YOU ARE NOT 
OBJECTING TO THE FACT THEY EXIST I I THINK WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT 
THIS LAP DANCING CLUBS DO EXIST 
THEY ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT 
REGULATED THERE IS A HUGE VARIETY 
I PASSED ONE RECENTLY I WAS A 
BOARDED UP SHOP W. THE WORDS SEX 
SHOWS FIVE TIMES NIGHTLY L. DON'T 
KNOW OBVIOUSLY SIMON'S CLUB'S ARE 
DIFFERENT 
IT HAS BEEN SKRALED ON DIFFERENT IT WOULD IMPLY IT WAS NOT BELONGING 
TO THE PREMISES 
DO YOU ENJOY IT IT IT IS A GOOD BUSINESS 
OF COURSE YOU 
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF IT DO 
YOU ENJOY LAP DANCING 
I ENJOY 
BEING IN MY PREMISES 
DO YOU ENJOY 
GIRLS DOING THAT 
IT IS A FORM OF 
ARTISTIC EXPRESSION 
COME ALONG 
SEMI NUDE ENTERTAINMENT THAT IS 
WHAT WE PROVIDE BEAR IN MIND THAT 
SEVENTY PER CENT OF OUR INCOME IS NOT RELATED TO 
THE DANCE ITSELF TO THE 
PERFORMANCE SO 
WHY DO PEOPLE GO 
INTO YOUR BUSINESSES AS IF NOT TO 
WATCH SEMI NAKED GIRLS DANCING 
THEY GO THERE BECAUSE THE 
ENTERTAINMENT IS FANTASTIC IT IS 
AN ENTERTAINMENT IN THE FORM OF 
NUDE AND SEMI NUDE PERFORMANCE IT 
IS A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT IT IS 
A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE CUSTOMER 
AND FOR THE PERFORMER LOCAL LOCAL AUTHORITIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
ARE FEELING INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED 
ABOUT THE FACT THEY FIND IT VERY 
DIFFICULT TO LICENSE THESE PLACES 
AS SEX ENTERTAINMENT PLACES LET'S 
FACE IT YOU SAY SEVENTY PER CENT OF YOUR MONEY 
COMES FROM THE SALE OF ALCOHOL THE 
MEN THAT GO THERE ARE PAYING OVER 
THE PREMIUM FOR THEIR ALCOHOL THEY 
ARE PAYING THAT BECAUSE THEY WANT 
TO LOOK AT NUDE OR SEMI NUDE WOMEN 
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM V. Y. 
A PROBLEM 
ABOUT THE FACT THAT IN MY QUIRBGTSY 
A PUB WANTING TO TAKE 
CONSTITUENCY A PUB WANTING TO TAKE 
ON A LICENSE LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED YARDS 
FROM A SCHOOL NEXT TO A PLAYGROUND 
NEAR CHURCHES 
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE 
BROUGHT THE LAW IN THE FIRST PLACE 
THIS IS FAIR ON THE OTHER HAND THE 
MINISTER HAS TAKE AN GREAT INTEREST 
IN THIS HE BELIEVES IT IS THE 
INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW AND IS 
LOOKING INTO THIS 
HAVE YOU GOT A 
DAUGHTER 
NO 
I DON'T L. HAVE THE DAUGHTER THE GUIDANCE UNDER SECTION ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO COVERS 
ALL THESE AREAS LOCAL RESIDENTS 
HAVE NOR POWER NOW THAN THEY HAD 
BEFORE 
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS FOR YOU BEFORE IN HAVING YOUR PREMISES SEEN AS THE 
SAME AS A SEX CINEMA DO YOU THINK 
YOU HAVE FOR EXAMPLE LESS IN COMMON 
THAN A SEX SHOP THAN YOU HAVE WITH 
A BALLET SHOP 
WE HAVE NOTHING IN 
COMMON WITH A SEX CINEMA 
COME ON 
THIS IS ABOUT THE MAKING WOMEN 
OBJECTS WHAT ELSE 
IF WE WERE TO 
PROVIDE A SEXUAL SERVICE PER SE 
THAT DESTROYS OUR BUSINESS MODEL 
WE ARE NOT ABOUT FULFILLING A 
CUSTOMER'S FANTASY 
WHAT IS NOT 
SEXUAL ABOUT WATCHING SEMI NAKED 
GIRLS DANCING 
THE SEXUAL ELEMENT 
IS IN THE WATCHING PRECISELY IT PRECISELY IT IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN PAGE 
THREE TO MAGAZINES OFF THE SHELF 
IF YOU WERE SAYING THAT THAT IS A 
THAT IS SEXUAL ACT BY WATCHING 
SEMI NAKED PERFORMER THAN YOU HAVE 
TO LOOK AT THEATRE ALL SORT OF 
THINGS 
DO YOU THINK IT AFFECTS THE THINGS WAY THAT MEN REGARD WOMEN GENERALLY 
THAT THEY KNOW THEY CAN PAY MONEY 
AND GET A GIRL TO TAKE HER CLOTHES 
OFF AND SHE WILL DANCE INTIMATELY 
FOR THEM 
NO I DON'T NO BECAUSE I 
JUST DON'T TO ANSWER THE QUESTION 
NO NO O. K. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH NO THE
