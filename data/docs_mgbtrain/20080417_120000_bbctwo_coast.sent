THE HEADLAND AT WALTON ON THE NAZE 
IT'S ON THE GEOLOGICAL MAP BECAUSE OF EROSION 
THE HIGH RATE OF WEAR AND TEAR REVEALS A UNIQUE GLIMPSE 
INTO OUR DISTANT PAST 
NICK CRANE LIKES A LITTLE TIME TRAVEL 
THERE ARE FEW PLACES WHERE THE COASTLINE CHANGES 
AS DRAMATICALLY AS THE SOUTH EAST 
THESE PILLBOXES WERE BUILT IN NINETEEN FORTY 
WHEN THIS WAS A CLIFFTOP 
SIXTY YEARS OF EROSION DROPPED THAT PILLBOX ONTO THE BEACH 
AS WELL AS DESTROYING OUR RECENT HISTORY IT'S REVEALING OUR ANCIENT PAST 
EROSION MAKES WALTON ONE OF THE FINEST SITES FOR FOSSILS IN BRITAIN 
GERALD LUCY HAS COLLECTED FOSSILS HERE SINCE HE WAS A BOY 
IT'S TAUGHT HIM HOW TO READ THE STORY OF THIS LANDSCAPE 
THIS IS LONDON CLAY WHICH USED TO BE A MUD UNDER THE SUB TROPICAL SEA 
THE ROCKS GET YOUNGER AS YOU GO UP 
IF WE MOVE UP HERE I'LL SHOW YOU MORE 
CLIMBING THE ROCK STRATA AT WALTON 
IS A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME 
HAVE YOU EVER FOUND ANY AMAZING FOSSILS HERE 
I THINK THE BEST FOSSILS SOMETIMES ARE THE SMALLEST 
MY FAVOURITE ARE SHARKS' TEETH 
WHICH YOU FIND ON THE BEACH 
THEY ARE SO COMMON AS FOSSILS AND SO EXQUISITELY PRESERVED 
AND THEY ARE FIFTY MILLION YEARS OLD THE SORT OF THING ANYBODY CAN FIND 
THIS CREATURE IS BY FAR NOT THE LARGEST OF THE TEETH YOU FIND 
THIS ONE HERE WHAT I HAVE IN MY POCKET 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT THIS IS FROM MEGALODON CARCHARODON MEGALODON 
IF YOU MAKE A MODEL OF THE JAWS YOU CAN STEP INTO ITS MOUTH STANDING UP 
YOU WOULD NOT WANT ONE IN YOUR BATH NO 
ALL THAT WAS FIFTEEN MILLION YEARS AGO 
MEGALODON DIED OUT BECAUSE THE WATERS OF ESSEX BECAME TOO COLD 
AS WE CLIMB THE FINDS BECOME MORE RECENT 
THE FINAL HALF YARD OF CLIFF WAS FORMED IN THE LAST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS' 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE GERALD 
WE'VE GOT A LAYER OF GRAVEL IT'S DIFFERENT 
IT CONSISTS OF PEBBLES WHICH AREN'T ROUNDED AT ALL 
IT'S NOT A BEACH GRAVEL SO IT WAS A RIVER A VERY LARGE RIVER 
BECAUSE THE SAME TYPE OF GRAVEL IS ACROSS MUCH OF NORTH ESSEX AND SUFFOLK 
RECENT STUDIES OF THESE GRAVELS SHOW THAT LARGE PARTS OF ESSEX 
WERE COVERED BY A VAST TORRENT THAT DRAGGED ROCKS HERE FROM AS FAR AWAY AS NORTH WALES 
TO APPRECIATE THE SCALE OF THIS ANCIENT RIVER 
WE NEED TO GET SOME PERSPECTIVE 
IT WAS A HUGE RIVER IT WENT RIGHT ACROSS HERE 
IT WAS MUCH LARGER THAN WE COULD IMAGINE AMAZING 
A GRADED RIVER MANY CHANNELS AND IT WAS THE THAMES 
THE THAMES HOW ASTONISHING 
WHAT WE CALL THE THAMES USED TO DRAIN FROM THE WELSH MOUNTAINS 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO THE RHINE 
IN THE MARSHLAND THAT IS NOW THE NORTH SEA 
BUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE RIVER'S COURSE WAS BLOCKED 
BY THE SOUTHERLY LIMIT OF A VAST ICE SHEET 
WHEN IT MELTED THE THAMES BURST THROUGH A WEAK SPOT TO FIND ITS NEW PATH 
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE ICE SHEET LONDON WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ESSEX 
LONDON WOULD HAVE BEEN AT WALTON ON THE NAZE
