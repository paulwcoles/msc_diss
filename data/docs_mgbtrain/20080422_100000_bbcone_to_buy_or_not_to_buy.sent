AS WE STROLL THROUGH THE SHROPSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE 
LOOK AT TECHNICAL WONDERS OF THE IRONBRIDGE GORGE 
AND INVESTIGATE THE LOWLY SWEET PEA WHICH ORIGINALLY WAS DEVELOPED IN WEM IN SHROPSHIRE 
WHEN LOOKING AT THE WHOA HA HA 
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM IS THIS YOUR AUDITION PIECE FOR B. B. C. FOUR 
BECAUSE THIS SSHH NO NO 
THIS IS A PROPERTY SHOW WE LOOK AT HOUSES 
NEVER HAVE WE EVER TALKED ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THE SWEET PEA 
CAN YOU LET ME CARRY ON I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING 
ALL RIGHT FINGERS CROSSED IT'S BUILDING TO SOMETHING THANK YOU 
THE SWEET PEA WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY HENRY ECKFORD 
WHO CAME FROM THIS AREA AND IF YOU JUST TAKE A WHIFF 
OF COURSE WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE HUMBLE HEDGEHOG WHO'S BEEN PRESERVED 
BY THE BRITISH HEDGEHOG PRESERVATION SOCIETY WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO 
RIGHT HEY YOU'RE STILL AT IT AREN'T YOU 
YES I AM HOUSE PROGRAMME PROPERTY PROGRAMME 
CAN I TELL YOU ABOUT SOME INNOVATIONS TO SAVE HEDGEHOGS 
LIKE THE HEDGEHOG RAMP UNDER CATTLE GRIDS AND IF ONE LOOKS 
THIS IS PATHETIC 
IT'S EMBARRASSING AND 
THE ANNUAL SWEET PEA FESTIVAL HELD EVERY YEAR IN WEM IS AN ABSOLUTE DELIGHT 
WILL YOU SHUT UP MAYBE MAYBE I NEED TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE 
DO YOU WANT HOUSES YES WE ALL DO ALL RIGHT O. K. HOW ABOUT THIS FACT 
IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN THE FIRST SKYSCRAPER WAS BUILT IN THE LOCAL AREA IN SHROPSHIRE 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS IS TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
IT IS NOT A PROGRAMME OBSESSED BY SWEET PEAS AND HEDGEHOG RAMPS 
WE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE HEADPHONES WE LOOK AT HOUSES 
AND THEN WE GIVE OUR HOUSE HUNTERS A UNIQUE CHANCE 
A CHANCE TO TRY BEFORE THEY BUY OBVIOUSLY 
I ASSUME HE WILL STOP SOON 
WHILE WE WAIT FOR KRISTIAN TO GET HIS HEAD OUT OF THE CLOUDS LET'S INTRODUCE TODAY'S BUYERS 
YVONNE AND AIDEN FLYNN WHO NEED ASSISTANCE TO MOVE FROM THEIR HOME IN STOKE ON TRENT 
TO BE NEARER TO YVONNE'S FAMILY IN THE WEST MIDLANDS 
AIDEN SUFFERS FROM DRY MACULAR DEGENERATION OR DRY M. D. FOR SHORT 
WHICH MEANS THAT HE'S LOST A GOOD PART OF HIS CENTRAL VISION 
AND SEES LIFE THROUGH A SOFT HAZE 
AS A RESULT HE'S RECENTLY RETIRED FROM HIS JOB AS A G. P. AND NOW SPENDS 
HIS TIME AT HOME WHERE YVONNE LOOKS AFTER HIM AND THEIR DOG CASSIE 
WHEN NOT TENDING TO AIDEN'S EVERY OTHER WHIM 
YVONNE IS TAKING A COURSE IN DOG BEHAVIOUR 
AND PLANS TO TAKE IT UP AS A CAREER 
IN THE MEANTIME SHE PRACTISES ON CASSIE DOWN GIRL 
DOWN LIE DOWN GOOD GIRL 
ROLL OVER CLEVER GIRL 
AIDEN AND YVONNE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE CALLED IN THE PROFESSIONALS 
FOR THIS HOUSE HUNTING MISSION FOR MANY REASONS 
AND THEY'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TURN UP SO YOU'VE GOT US 
NO NO YOU HAVE DRY M. D. 
THAT'S RIGHT CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US WHAT THE CONDITION IS 
YEAH MACULAR IS THE CENTRAL PART OF YOUR EYE THAT DEALS WITH 
FINE DETAILS AND COLOUR AND SHARPNESS OF VISION 
AND I'VE GOT A DEGENERATIVE DISEASE WHERE THESE RECEPTORS THE PIXELS 
AREN'T WORKING AS WELL AS THEY SHOULD 
I'M NOT ACTUALLY BLIND I'VE STILL GOT MY PERIPHERAL SIGHT 
BUT IF I'M LOOKING AT YOURSELF ED 
I GET THE OUTLINE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE SMILING SCOWLING LAUGHING 
I WOULD SAY YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN 
YOU COULD HAVE TOO MUCH DETAIL OF ED'S FACE TO BE HONEST 
WHAT WOULD HELP YOU IN THE HOUSE 
YOU NEED TO BE AWARE THAT I'M NOT VERY GOOD WITH STEPS AND OBSTACLES 
SO WHEN WE GO HOUSE HUNTING HOW DO YOU EVALUATE A HOUSE 
ARE WE TOTALLY RELYING ON YVONNE HERE NOT TOTALLY NO 
MY VISION'S DEPENDENT ON THE LIGHT CONDITIONS 
IF IT'S NOT TOO BRIGHT AND I'M NOT DIRECTLY INTO THE SUNLIGHT 
I FIND IT A LOT EASIER 
I'M GOING TO DELVE NOW FOR SOME HOUSE FACTS 
WHAT KIND OF HOUSE YVONNE ARE WE HUNTING FOR 
WELL I THINK WE'D LIKE SOMETHING DETACHED SEMI RURAL 
THREE TO FOUR BEDROOMS A STUDY 
NOT ASKING MUCH AM I NO NO 
QUITE LITERALLY THE MOON ON A STICK 
YES I'D LIKE A HOME OFFICE 
BECAUSE I'M STUDYING AT THE MOMENT BUT EVENTUALLY I AM HOPING TO BE WORKING FROM HOME 
AND WHAT ARE YOU STUDYING FOR I'M DOING DOG BEHAVIOUR I HAVE A QUESTION 
IS IT AN OLD WIVES' TALE BUT IF YOU HAD AN OLD DOG 
AND YOU WANTED TO TEACH IT SOME NEW TRICKS 
WOULD THAT BE POSSIBLE YES I THINK SO 
WE'VE LEARNT SOMETHING HERE TODAY WHAT ELSE 
WE'D LIKE A NICE PRIVATE SORT OF REAR GARDEN 
THAT WE CAN EXERCISE THE DOG ON PREFERABLY A FLAT LAWN 
DO WE HAVE A TASTE ON THE WAY THE PROPERTY LOOKS 
OLDER PROPERTIES ARE 
MORE INTERESTING TO BE QUITE HONEST BUT HAVING SAID THAT THE DOWNSIDE IS 
VERY OFTEN THEY NEED MORE RENOVATION OR MAINTENANCE 
AND ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE LAZY PEOPLE 
WE'RE LAZY WELL I'M ONLY THINKING OF MY WIFE IN THE SENSE THAT 
MUGGINS ISN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE MUCH OF A HELP BUT IT'LL BE THE ROYAL WE 
THAT WILL BE DOING THE MAINTAINING 
IF WE THE HUGE ROYAL WE MANAGE TO FIND A PERIOD PROPERTY 
THAT REALLY WAS IN GOOD CONDITION WITH LOTS OF CHARACTER 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD YES IN GOOD CONDITION 
THAT WOULD BE LOVELY THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE 
A MODERN KITCHEN AND BATHROOM GREAT 
WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET 
UM ABSOLUTE TOPS WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
O. K. IT'S STILL A VERY HANDSOME BUDGET I FEEL 
IF THOSE PROPERTY EXPERTS DON'T TURN UP WE COULD PROBABLY DO SOMETHING FOR THAT BUDGET 
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE DOWNPLAYING YOURSELF REALLY FIVE YEARS IN THE GAME FOCUS 
WE HAVE FAITH IN YOU ABSOLUTE FAITH 
OH WE DO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO PULL SOMETHING OUT THE BAG 
WE'RE GOING TO TRY AT LEAST AS GOOD AS TRY 
IF WE CAN MAKE A DOG SCHOOL HAPPEN THEN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO 
SO WHAT WE SHOULD DO NOW IS LEAVE YOU TWO ROASTING SLOWLY BY THE FIRE 
WHILE WE GO OFF AND DO SOME COLD WORK HOUSE HUNTING 
ALL RIGHT WE WILL SEE YOU LATER SEE YOU LATER 
ED ED ED I SO WANT TO FIND THEM A HOUSE 
I CAN'T DEAL WITH NOT FINDING SOMEBODY ELSE ANOTHER HOUSE 
THE LAST TIME THAT HAPPENED I ATE AN ENTIRE JAR OF EXPIRED GHERKINS 
THAT WAS A WEIRD EXPERIENCE I HAD TO LIVE THROUGH THE GASSES OF THAT 
NOW KEEP IT QUIET BECAUSE THEY'RE BEHIND US 
SMILE TURN ROUND LOOK CONFIDENT 
YOU TALK TO LOCAL PEOPLE I'LL SPEAK TO AN ESTATE AGENT 
O. K. ON THREE THREE TWO ONE 
I'M OFF 
NOW KRISTIAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SHROPSHIRE 
YOU WON'T START TALKING ABOUT HEDGEHOG RAMPS AND SWEET PEAS AGAIN ARE YOU 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WAX LYRICAL ABOUT SHREWSBURY FLOWER SHOW 
DID YOU KNOW IT'S THE LONGEST RUNNING FLOWER SHOW IN THE WORLD 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO TALK ABOUT 
BRIDGNORTH SEEING AS WE'RE LOOKING IN THAT AREA 
ALL RIGHT WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TELL YOU 
THAT BRIDGNORTH IS DIVIDED INTO TWO TOWNS THE UPPER TOWN AND THE LOWER TOWN THAT'S MORE LIKE IT 
OR THAT THE FUNICULAR RAILWAY THAT CONNECTS THE TWO TOWNS RISES 
ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN FEET UP THE SANDSTONE CLIFFS AT A GRADIENT OF THIRTY THREE DEGREES BRILLIANT 
I'LL MATCH YOUR THIRTY THREE DEGREES AND RAISE YOU AN AVERAGE PROPERTY PRICE OF THREE THIRTY K. FOR A DETACHED HOUSE 
NOT TOO STEEP THEN 
AIDEN AND YVONNE MIGHT BE ON THE MONEY HERE 
BUT HOW FAR WOULD THEIR BUDGET OF FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STRETCH ROUND THE COUNTRY 
IN LOSTWITHIEL IN CORNWALL 
YOU COULD PICK UP THIS DISTINCTIVE FOUR BEDROOMED DETACHED HOUSE 
I WOULD APPLY THE WORDS CHARMING AND COSY TO IT KRISTIAN 
AND IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR FIFTY K. 
I'D GO FOR THIS FANTASTIC TWO BEDROOM TWO BATHROOM APARTMENT 
IN EAST LONDON A POSITIVE WORK OF ART IN CHROME AND LEATHER 
VERY SPACIOUS AND DESIRABLE AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
BUT IF RURAL SUFFOLK'S MORE YOUR BAG AND IT IS IN FACT MY BAG 
YOU MIGHT BE TEMPTED BY THIS QUAINT THREE BED COTTAGE WITH ITS PERIOD FEATURES AND GREAT VIEWS 
A BARGAIN AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
RIGHT I'VE BROUGHT MYSELF TO THE HISTORIC TOWN OF BRIDGNORTH 
AND HERE I AM AND HERE I AM 
INTERESTING THING ABOUT BRIDGNORTH THERE'S A HIGH TOWN AND A LOW TOWN 
CURRENTLY I'M IN THE HIGH TOWN 
I'M GOING TO PHONE SOME ESTATE AGENTS TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON

AN EXCUSE TO USE THE RAILWAY 
AIDEN IS VISUALLY IMPAIRED SO I NEED

YVONNE WANTS TO BECOME A DOG BEHAVIOURALIST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
HELLO ARE YOU AN ESTATE AGENT

PLENTY OF RIVERSIDE WALKS SO ENOUGH EXERCISE FOR THE DOG 
I'M MEANT TO BE OVER THERE I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENED

IT IS BEAUTIFUL HAVE A LOOK AT THE BACK 
AND THE TRICKIEST ONE TO ALWAYS FIND IS THE WILD CARD PROPERTY AND MY GOODNESS IS IT A FIND 
WE HAVE BEEN CONTROVERSIAL WITH THIS ONE BECAUSE 
IT IS NOT A DETACHED PROPERTY IT IS ONLY SEMI DETACHED 
BUT WE DECIDED TO WAIVE CAUTION IN THE WIND 
WELL IT'S A CONVERTED BARN IT'S LARGE OPEN SPACES YES THERE ARE STEPS BUT AS HE POINTED OUT 
ONCE HE GETS USED TO THEM IT'S NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL 
DO YOU WANT TO SHOW THE BIT AT THE BACK THERE IS A GARDEN 
YOU COULD IMAGINE SPANIELS BEING TAUGHT WHATEVER IT IS THAT YVONNE'S GOING TO TEACH THEM 
IT'S A WILD CARD IT TICKS PRETTY MUCH EVERY BOX 
IT IS GOING TO BE AT THE END OF THE SHOW THE START OF THE SHOW WILL BE 
COMMENCING THE VIEWINGS WITH THIS PROPERTY NUMBER ONE MY ONE

RIGHT AIDEN AND YVONNE

SOME OF THIS PROPERTY DATES BACK TO THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
IT'S CALLED THE ONE HUNDRED HOUSE READY FOR A HISTORY LESSON 
YES NOT REALLY YES OH COME ON YES I AM 
YES GOOD YVONNE'S WITH ME 
THIS IS WHERE THE UNDERLORD OF THE LORD USED TO LIVE AND IT WAS HIS JOB TO FIND 
ONE HUNDRED FIGHTING MEN IN TIMES OF WAR THE ONE HUNDRED HOUSE MARVELLOUS 
RIGHT IT'S TIMELESS SOME ORIGINAL FEATURES 
YOU'VE GOT SOME VERY NINETEEN EIGHTIES FEATURES 
BUT YOU HAVE GOT A VERY NICE HOUSE WITH SOME LOVELY GARDENS AND SOME LOVELY ROOMS SO WHAT DO YOU THINK 
GREAT IT'S LOVELY YEAH 
I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE MAIN ROAD THAT'S A FACTOR 
AND NO FOOTPATHS THAT'S TRUE 
THERE'S ONE MASSIVE POSITIVE ABOUT THIS HOUSE 
IT'S NOT THE HISTORY IT'S THAT IF YOU HELD YOUR BREATH YOU COULD GET TO A PUB 
THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT RIGHT LEAD ON MCDUFF 
IF YOU DO LIKE IT YOU'VE GOT THE PUB NEXT DOOR 
YES AND IF WE DON'T LIKE IT WE'VE GOT THE PUB NEXT DOOR 
EXACTLY WE'RE ALL WINNING GO ON AND ENJOY 
GO ON OFF YOU GO YOU PUSH ON THROUGH THERE O. K. 
KNOW ANY MORE ABOUT THIS HUNDRED MEN HE LIVED IN A HOUSE FOR A HUNDRED BLOKES IN A FIGHT 
IT ALSO USED TO BE A TITHE BARN WHICH IS QUITE INTERESTING AND IT ALSO USED TO BE A COURTHOUSE 
YOU SAY QUITE INTERESTING YET 
ALSO DOWNSTAIRS THEY USED TO KEEP THE BEER FROM THE LOCAL PUB IT ISN'T AT ALL 
IS THIS KRISTIAN'S LOVELY FRONT DOOR 
I LOVE THE KNOCKER I FEEL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MAYBE FIVE YEARS

GORGEOUS THAT'S A LOVELY DINING ROOM OUR TABLE WOULD GO IN THERE 
PLENTY OF LIGHT HERE NO PROBLEM HEY A CHAISE LONGUE 
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE THAT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL TABLE 
BUT IT DOESN'T COME WITH THE HOUSE NO

AND LOOK AT THAT FABULOUS GARDEN CAN YOU SEE STRAIGHT OUT YEP I'VE GOT IT

MORE STEPS THREE STEPS BIG STEPS UP GOT YA THAT'S IT 
IT'S NOT TOO BAD REALLY 
IT'S LOVELY HEY THIS IS GORGEOUS 
THEY DON'T WANT STEPS BUT THESE ARE THE ONLY STEPS 
APART FROM THE STEP IN THE CONSERVATORY WITH THE GREEN OAK 
APART FROM THOSE STEPS AND THAT STEP AND THE STEP AT THE FRONT THESE ARE THE ONLY STEPS 
GREAT FIRE IT'S FANTASTIC 
IT IS ISN'T IT A REAL ONE TOO AND REAL BEAMS YEAH 
IT'S GOT PLENTY OF CHARACTER THIS HAS 
IT IS RUMOURED THAT THE BEAMS OF THE CEILING ACTUALLY ORIGINALLY CAME FROM A SHIP 
IT'S THE PUB OH YES RIGHT AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
OH YEAH 
CAN I GIVE YOU A LITTLE INTERESTING FACT I HAVE ABOUT THAT BAY WINDOW 
I'LL JUDGE WHETHER IT'S INTERESTING IT'S INTERESTING YOU SAID JUDGE 
THAT'S WHERE A JUDGE WOULD HAVE SAT WHEN THIS WAS A COURT 
HERE WE ARE IN THE KITCHEN BIT SMALL ISN'T IT 
A BIT NARROW LONG AND THIN BIT NARROW 
HISTORICALLY SPEAKING IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
THEY WEREN'T BIG ON KITCHENS 
THEY WERE PROBABLY OUT HERE DOING A HOG ROAST 
THAT'S NOT MY TERRITORY BUT IT'S STILL QUITE LIGHT 
IT'S O. K. YEAH YES IT'S FINE IT'S GOT EVERYTHING 
THERE'S A WINE RACK SO THAT'S NICE A PUB AND A WINE RACK WE'RE DOING WELL

WELL YOU CAN HAVE THE LITTLE ONE 
YEAH I'LL HAVE THE LITTLE DESK O. K. YOU CAN LOOK OUT THE WINDOW 
SHE WANTS TO LOOK AFTER DOGS 
YOU DON'T PUT A DOG AT A DESK 
HERE'S A NICE DOUBLE BEDROOM 
YES THIS IS LOVELY YES 
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THIS IS A BUNGALOW OR A HOUSE 
YEAH YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN A BUNGALOW 
BUT FROM THE OUTSIDE IT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE A HOUSE 
THEY ARE IN A BUNGALOW ONE WITH A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE IT HAS SO MANY 
STEPS IN IT 
INSIDE IT'S GREAT VERY LEVEL INSIDE A LOT OF ROOMS 
THIS IS A GOOD SIZED DOUBLE BEDROOM 
ONE TWO THREE THREE STEPS 
I DON'T WANT TO SLAP ME THE AMOUNT OF STEPS THERE ARE 
OH LOOK AT THIS THIS IS THE GIRLY ROOM OBVIOUSLY ISN'T IT 
VERY PRETTY VERY PRETTY 
TWENTY HOLD ON THERE'S MORE 
OOH OH I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE MASTER BEDROOM AIDEN 
THIS IS OUR ROOM YEAH YEAH IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
OH THIS IS NICE I LOVE THE WARDROBES 
FABULOUS WELL DONE KRISTIAN THIS IS NICE 
OH LOOK AT THIS THERE'S A WINDOW SEAT 
A WHAT A WINDOW SEAT LOOKING OUT TO THE GARDEN 
WHO USED TO SIT THERE 
BOB HOLNESS WHEN HE OWNED THE HOUSE 
INTERESTING FACT THERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
ED'S HISTORY INSTEAD OF BEING BASED ON FACT IS COMPLETE FICTION 
AH THIS IS GREAT LOOK AT THIS M. M. M. 
YEAH LOOK AT THAT SHOWER HEY THAT'S A FANCY ONE ISN'T IT 
THAT'S A BIT POSH 
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO SPOT A POSH SHOWER NO I DON'T 
BASICALLY FIND OUT WHERE IT WAS MANUFACTURED 
IF IT WAS KENSINGTON OR CHELSEA IT IS A POSH SHOWER 
YOU HAVE YOUR STUDY I'LL HAVE THIS SHOWER IT'S BRILLIANT 
OH WE'LL HAVE TO SEE ABOUT THAT 
SHALL WE GO AND FIND KRISTIAN I THINK WE SHOULD 
YEAH I THINK HE'S DONE US FINE FOR A SOUTHERNER YES 
NOT BAD NO 
IT'S UNLIKELY I'M ABOUT TO GET A WARM EMBRACE FROM YOUR GOOD SELF NOT FROM ME 
I'M GOING TO FEEL THE WARMTH FROM THOSE TWO 
O. K. MIND THE STEPS AS YOU GO IN THOUGH OOH 
I WANT TO GIVE YOU MORE HISTORY COS I THINK IT'S WHAT MAKES THIS HOUSE SPECIAL 
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE ONE HUNDRED FIGHTING MEN 
ALSO THIS ROOM HERE USED TO BE USED AS A COURT AS A WHAT OH O. K. 
AS A COURT SO THE ANGLO SAXON WORD FOR COURT IS ANYONE KNOW NO 
MOOT MOOT 
AND ALONG THE SIDES THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN BENCHES 
THE JUDGE WOULD HAVE SAT IN THAT WINDOW THERE AND THEY HAD WEIRD WAYS OF DEALING WITH CRIME 
IMAGINE THERE WAS A FEW HOUSES AND A CRIME HAD HAPPENED 
THEY WOULD CALL EVERYBODY IN AND IF THEY COULDN'T FIND WHO HAD DONE IT 
THEY WOULD ALL BE PUNISHED 
FAIR ENOUGH A LITTLE HARSH I FEEL A LITTLE HARSH 
SO YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF HISTORY IN THIS HOUSE 
YOU SAID YOU WANTED CHARACTER AND CHARM AND I'VE GIVEN THAT YES OH ABSOLUTELY 
IN FLOODS YES IT'S DIFFERENT 
BUT AS MUCH AS I LOVE THIS HOUSE ANY CONCERNS OR NIGGLING DOUBTS ABOUT IT 
I WANT YOU TO BE HONEST AND I FEEL YOU WILL BE 
YES MY MAIN CONCERN IS THE ROAD IT'S A VERY BUSY FAST ROAD 
NO FOOTPATHS AND AIDEN COULDN'T POSSIBLY WALK IT 
NO I'D HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ON THAT ROAD KRISTIAN 
BUT IT'S ONLY A SMALL NEGATIVE I'M SURE THERE'S OTHER PLACES TO WALK AROUND HERE 
SO AT THE BACK OF THE PROPERTY LITERALLY WHERE THE FENCE IS 
BEHIND THAT FENCE IS A PUBLIC FOOTPATH AND RIGHT OF WAY 
SO SHOULD YOU WANT TO GO RAMBLING WITH THE DOGS 
OR GO OUT AND IT'S SAFE AND IT'S COUNTRYSIDE THAT WAY YOU'RE FINE AH THAT'S FINE 
AND FIFTEEN MINUTES OR TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES' WALK THAT WAY THERE'S ANOTHER PUB 
BUT THEN NO ROAD NO CROSSING ROADS SO IT'S EXERCISE AND SAFE 
BETWEEN PUBS LET'S SEE WHO'S GOOD AT GUESSING THE PRICE 
O. K. O. K. LET'S GO AND TRY IT

IT'S GREAT IT'S LOVELY ISN'T IT 
IF YOU HAD A DINING ROOM AS GLAMOROUS AS THAT

JUST TO MAKE SURE THE FOOD WAS MATCHING THE SURROUNDINGS 
IT'S A NICE KITCHEN THIS IS THE SORT OF THING I LIKE 
YES IT'S A GOOD KITCHEN YES I LIKE THAT ONE NICE KITCHEN 
THERE'S A SCALE CALLED KRISTIAN'S SCALE USED FOR MANY YEARS TO JUDGE KITCHENS

ALL THE WOODLAND OUT THERE AT THE BACK H. M. M. 
AND THE LAWN 
YEP THAT'S O. K. THAT'S FINE YES

AND FIND OUT AND SEE WHAT HE THINKS 
WELL ED GOOD LUCK THEY'RE COMING TO FIND YOU 
THEY'RE GOING TO FIND ME IN THE FREAKY WOODS 
WHEN I INTRODUCED THIS HOUSE TO YOU THIS LOVELY BUNGALOW DWELLING 
YOU DESCRIBED THE WOODLAND THAT COMES WITH THE PROPERTY AS 
SPOOKY SPOOKY 
IT'S WOODLANDS THEY ARE GOING TO BE SPOOKY BUT THERE'S SOMETHING 
YOU CAN DO WITH THIS BECAUSE IT IS YOURS 
BUT THE FORESTRY COMMISSION HAS AN INTEREST 
YOU CAN'T JUST SLASH AND BURN IT BUT YOU CAN REMOVE SOME TREES 
AND IF YOU DID THAT YOU COULD THEN PLACE WITHIN THAT AREA YOUR DOGS A HA 
AND MAYBE YOU COULD USE THOSE LOGS AND MAKE DOG CABINS OUT OF THEM 
HOLIDAY HOMES LODGES FOR THE PUPS 
SO I'M GIVING YOU ANOTHER BUSINESS INTEREST 
YES IT GIVES THEM THE NORDIC ALPINE FEEL 
YET WITHIN THE HALLOWED AREA OF BRIDGNORTH 
IS THAT ACCEPTABLE TO YOU AS A POSSIBILITY 
IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA ED YES IT IS YES YES IT IS

I THINK I'D RATHER HAVE THE FIRST ONE FOR THAT MONEY TO BE HONEST 
I THINK THE FIRST ONE'S THE HONESTY IS WASTED 
BECAUSE EVERYONE LOVES THE WILD CARD AND IT'S THIS WAY O. K. 
I THINK YOU COULD JUSTIFIABLY USE THE WORDS 
MAJESTIC AND IMPOSING ABOUT TODAY'S WILD CARD 
I RECKON YOU COULD ADD A SPRINKLING OF RURAL AND SPACIOUS 
A DUSTING OF REFURBISHED AND STYLISH AND WE'RE ALMOST THERE
