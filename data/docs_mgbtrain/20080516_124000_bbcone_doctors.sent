HEY HOW WAS THE DRIVING LESSON 
WELL IF YOU MUST KNOW 
I'M NOT GETTING IN A CAR WITH HER EVER AGAIN WAS IT REALLY THAT BAD 
IT WAS A NIGHTMARE 
SHE DIDN'T LISTEN TO A WORD I SAID 
SHE WOULDN'T STOP TALKING 
DON'T DO THIS DON'T DO THAT 
YOU'RE GOING TOO SLOW YOU'RE GOING TOO FAST 
BUT I THOUGHT SHE COULD DRIVE OH SHE CAN EVERYBODY UP THE WALL 
IT'S NOT EASY TEACHING SOMEONE ELSE TO DRIVE 
MAYBE SHE WAS NERVOUS 
NERVES OF STEEL THAT ONE 
SHE MADE ME A NERVOUS WRECK 
YOU MUSTN'T LET ONE BAD LESSON GET YOU DOWN I'M NOT 
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN NOW THEN 
I WONDER WHAT SHE'LL DO ABOUT LESSONS NOW 
I DON'T KNOW OR CARE AS LONG AS SHE DOESN'T ASK ME 
WELL ONE THINGS FOR SURE I'M NOT LETTING HER TAKE ME OUT AGAIN 
IT IS EXTREMELY TENDER AND DISTENDED 
YOU MUST'VE BEEN IN A LOT OF PAIN WHEN I SAW YOU EARLIER 
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY I WAS HOPING IT WOULD GO AWAY 
AND YOU'VE GOT A TEMPERATURE 
YOU NEED TO GO TO HOSPITAL NO 
WHY NOT THAT'S MY BUSINESS 
JUST GIVE ME SOME MORE PILLS TO STOP THIS PAIN THAT'S ALL I WANT 
I CAN'T YOU NEED TO SEE A SURGEON 
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT 
YOU'RE CLEARLY NOT ALL RIGHT MRS. PENDLE 
YOU'RE VERY ILL AND I CAN'T HELP YOU 
NOW LET ME CALL FOR AN AMBULANCE 
NO I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE AND IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE ME ANYTHING FOR THIS THEN PLEASE JUST GO 
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU LIKE THIS 
MY DAUGHTER WILL LOOK AFTER ME 
IS SHE HERE I DON'T KNOW 
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH HER 
LEAVE HER ALONE SHE MUST BE ABLE TO SEE HOW MUCH PAIN YOU'RE IN 
YOU'RE MAKING ME TIRED PLEASE JUST GO AWAY 
YOU'RE SHOWING SIGNS OF PERITONITIS 
IF NOTHING'S DONE ABOUT THAT YOU COULD DIE 
WELL WE'VE ALL GOT TO GO SOME TIME HAVEN'T WE 
NOW PLEASE WILL YOU JUST GO

SHE'S IN A LOT OF PAIN AND I THINK SHE'S SHOWING SIGNS OF PERITONITIS 
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM SHE WON'T GO TO HOSPITAL 
FLATLY REFUSES TO LET ME HELP 
HAVE YOU TOLD HER WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE IF SHE DOES NOTHING 
WHY WON'T SHE GO INTO HOSPITAL 
SHE WON'T SAY SHE JUST REFUSES TO GO WHAT DO I DO 
YOU CAN'T FORCE A PATIENT TO ACCEPT TREATMENT 
HAVE YOU DOCUMENTED THIS IN YOUR NOTES YES 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD DO 
I DON'T KNOW THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU 
BUT SHE'S YOUR PATIENT 
YOU'RE MY MENTOR I'M NOT YOUR CONSCIENCE 
YOU HAVE TO BE HAPPY IN YOURSELF THAT YOU'VE DONE ALL THAT YOU CAN 
BUT THAT'S JUST IT SHE WON'T LET ME HELP DO YOU WANT TO GIVE UP ON HER 
NO THEN DON'T 
YOU'VE ANSWERED YOUR OWN QUESTION 
SHE'S A SICK WOMAN A SITTING TARGET 
YOU'RE HER DOCTOR YOU'RE ALLOWED TO BE CONCERNED
