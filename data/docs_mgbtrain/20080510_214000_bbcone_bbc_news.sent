GOOD EVENING AID AGENCIES NOW SAY 
UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE MAY HAVE DIED 
IN THE BURMESE CYCLONE AND THEY 
WARN THEY ARE IN A RACE AGAINST 
TIME TO PREVENT DISEASE AND 
STARVATION PUSHING THAT FIGURE EVEN 
HIGHER CYCLONE NARGIS STRUCK BURMA 
A WEEK AGO BUT AID AID FOR THE 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SURVIVORS 
IS ONLY TRICKLING INTO THE COUNTRY 
TODAY ITS MILITARY LEADERS WENT 
AHEAD WITH A REFERENDUM ON AL NEW 
CONSTITUTION DESPITE CALLS FOR IT 
TO BE POSTPONED 
JOURNEYING INTO THE IRRAWADDY DELTA 
NOW AL WASTELAND OF MUD AND RUINED 
HOMES THIS TOWN WAS TORN APART BY 
WIND AND WATER THERE'S NOT A 
SINGLE BUILDING LEFT UNDAMAGED 
THE SURVIVORS NEED EVERYTHING 
FOOD SHELTER MEDICAL TREATMENT 
THEY ARE GETTING VERY LITTLE AT 
HOSPITALS IN THE DELTA THERE'S NO 
POWER NOW AND THE STAFF ARE 
OVERWHELMED DEALING WITH DISEASE 
INJURIES AND BIRTHS 
THE HEALTH OF YOUNG CHILDREN IS A 
SERIOUS CONCERN 
THE SITUATION IS 
REALLY OUT OF CONTROL TOO MANY 
PATIENTS AND VERY LITTLE HELP WE 
HAVE TO ORGANISE WITH THE HIGHER 
AUTHORITY TO ORGANISATION FOR FOOD 
AND MEDICINES AND SANITATION CLEAN 
WATER 
BUT THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES WATER ARE TOO BUSY WITH THE REFERENDUM 
WHICH THEY HAVE ENSURED THEY WILL 
WIN IT COULD ENSHRINE MILITARY 
DOMINANCE HERE FOR DECADES MORE 
BURMA'S RULER GENERAL THAN SHWE 
HAS BEEN VISIBLE THROUGHOUT THE 
CRISIS BUT HE DID SHOW UP TO VOTE 
PHOTO OPS ON STATE TELEVISION SHOW 
SMILING OFFICERS HANDING OUT HELP 
TO THE CYCLONE'S VICTIMS BUT THE 
REALITY IS VERY DIFFERENT 
INTERNATIONAL AID IS JUST TRICKLING 
IN AND THE DISASTER EXPERTS NEEDED 
TO DISTRIBUTE IT ARE BEING KEPT OUT 
SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE CYCLONE STRUCK 
THE IRRAWADDY DELTA AND THIS IS 
WHAT THE INTERNATIONAL RELIEF 
EFFORT AMOUNTS TO A FEW PALATES OF 
AID GOING IN ON ONE OR TWO FLIGHTS 
A DAY YOU WOULD EXPECT THIS 
AIRPORT JUST AN HOUR'S FLIGHT FROM 
RANGOON TO BE TEEMING WITH 
INTERNATIONAL AIDWORKERS BUT IT'S 
ALMOST DESERTED 
TWO PLANES WENT IN FROM THAILAND 
TODAY THE UN HOPES TO SEND IN 
ANOTHER THREE IT'S NOWHERE NEAR 
ENOUGH 
THE FORMER DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER 
JOHN PRESCOTT SAYS HE URGED TONY

FRUSTRATING ANNOYING BEWILDERING 
AND FRICKLY HE SAYS BUT MR. 
PRESCOTT ALSO URGED GORDON BROWN TO 
RESIGN AS CHANCELLOR AND TO FIGHT 
TONY BLAIR AS A BACKBENCHER 
SOMETHING IT'S REPORTED MR. BROWN 
SHRANK FROM 
MEANWHILE CHERIE BLAIR ALSO HAS A 
BOOK OUT THIS WEEK WITH EXTRACTS 
PUBLISHED IN TWO PAPERS TODAY 
SHE SAYS TONY BLAIR WOULD HAVE 
STEPPED DOWN IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE IF MR. BROWN 
HAD BACKED HIS PLANS TO REFORM

THE KEYS OF DOWNING STREET OVER HER 
HUSBAND'S HEAD TENSIONS BETWEEN

RUNNING OFF WITH THE BLOKE NEXT 
DOOR DOOR DESPITE THIS SHE SAYS TONY BLAIR 
HAS BEEN TALKING TO GORDON BROWN 
AND GIVING HIM ADVICE ON THE NEXT 
ELECTION SHE SAYS SHE THINKS 
GORDON BROWN COULD WIN MR. BROWN 
WON'T RELISH THESE MEM WIRES FROM 
THE VERY RECENT PAST ALTHOUGH 
NEITHER DELIVERS KNOCK OUT BLOW 
BOTH RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS 
PERSONALITY QUESTIONS HE WOULD NO 
DOUBT RATHER AVOID 
A SCHOOLBOY HAS BEEN KILLED IN 
SOUTH EAST LONDON THE DAY AFTER 
HIS SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY JIMMY MIZEN WAS 
ATTACKED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT BY 
ANOTHER YOUTH IN THE BAKERY WHERE 
HE WORKED 
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY JIMMY MIZEN WAS 
INSIDE THIS BAKERY STORE HE KNOW 
THIS MORNING THERE WAS 
DISTURBANCE AND JIMMY WHO TURNED 
SIXTEEN YESTERDAY WAS LEFT DEAD IT IS 
THOUGHT HE KNEW HIS ATTACKER THE THE WOMAN WHO WORKED IN THE SHOP WAS 
VERY NERVOUS CRYING BLOOD 
EVERYWHERE GLASS ON THE FLOOR 
THEN I TRIED TO HOLD THE MOTHER 
PUT HIM OUTSIDE BECAUSE THERE WAS 
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED DURING DURING HIS SHORT LIFE JIMMY MADE MANY 
FRIENDS WHO WANTED TO PAY TRIBUTE 
TO HIM 
HE WAS SUCH A LOVELY PERSON 
WALKING TO SCHOOL SEEING HIM AT 
SCHOOL PLAYING GAMES WITH HIM 
PRIMARY SCHOOL GAMES CHILDHOOD 
MEMORIES I WILL NEVER FORGET ALL I 
CAN SAY IS I HOPE HIS FAMILY I 
KNOW HIS FAMILY WELL I HOPE THEY 
STAY STRONG AND ALL MY PRAYERS AND 
THOUGHTS ARE WITH THEM A A POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION WILL NOW BE 
CARRIED OUT ON THE DEAD TEENAGER 
THE POLICE DON'T BELIEVE THAT JIMMY 
MIZEN'S DEATH WAS GANG RELATED 
DETECTIVES ARE SPEAKING TO LOCAL 
PEOPLE TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER 
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AND THE 
MOTIVE BEHIND THIS DEATH 
TONIGHT PRAYERS WERE SAID FOR JIMMY 
AND HIS FAMILY WHO HAVE BEEN 
DESCRIBED AS DEVOUT CATHOLICS 
LIVING IN A CLOSE KNIT COMMUNITY 
A MAN HAS DIED AFTER HIS CAR WAS 
HIT BY A TRAIN ON A LEVEL CROSSING 
IN DERBYSHIRE THE TRAIN WAS 
TRAVELLING FROM DERBY TO CREWE ON

SERIOUSLY INJURED 
THE ZIMBABWEAN OPPOSITION LEADER 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI SAYS HE WILL TAKE 
PART IN A SECOND ROUND OF THE 
DISPUTED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
AGAINST ROBERT MUGABE UNTIL NOW MR. 
TSVANGIRAI HAD ARGUED HIS PARTY WON 
MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT OF THE VOTE SO THERE 
WAS NO NEED FOR ANOTHER ROUND BUT 
SPEAKING IN SOUTH AFRICA HE SAID A 
SECOND POLL SHOULD BE HELD WITHIN A 
FORTNIGHT AND WITH FULL ACCESS FOR 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS 
AFTER WEEKS OF WILL HE OR WON'T HE 
ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION LEADER 
STEPPED BACK INTO THE RACE TODAY 
SAYING A RUN OFF WOULD KNOCK OUT 
THE DICTATOR FOR GOOD 
WE WILL 
CONTEST THE RUN OFF AND THE PEOPLE 
WILL FINALLY PREVAIL THE PEOPLE 
HAVE SPOKEN BEFORE AND THE PEOPLE 
WILL SPEAK AGAIN L. AM READY AND 
THE PEOPLE ARE READY FOR THE FINAL 
ROUND 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WANTS THAT ROUND FINAL ROUND TO BE VERY DIFFERENT TO 
THE FIRST ONE HE'S CALLING FOR 
AFRICAN PEACEKEEPERS TO BE DEPLOYED 
AND FOR FULL ACCESS FOR FOREIGN 
OBSERVERS AND JOURNALISTS THERE'S 
BEEN NO COMMENT FROM PRESIDENT 
ROBERT MUGABE LAST SEEN YESTERDAY 
PLAYING HOST TO SOUTH AFRICA'S 
THABO MBEKI BUT HIS JUSTICE 
MINISTER HAS RULED OUT PRE 
CONDITIONS FOR A RUN OFF HIS 
HENCHMEN ARE HARD AT WORK 
TERRORISING THE OPPOSITION THIS 
MAN IS ONE OF THE LATEST VICTIMS 
THERE ARE NOW ALMOST ONE THOUSAND REPORTED 
CASES ACCORDING TO A ZIMBABWEAN 
DOCTORS' GROUP WHO SAY THE VIOLENCE 
AND TORTURE ARE ESCALATING IF A 
SECOND ROUND DOES TAKE PLACE AND 
MANY HAVE THEIR DOUBTS IT WILL BE 
A BLOODY ONE AND A RISKY ONE FOR 
THE OPPOSITION THE BEATINGS AND 
THE BRUTALITY HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL 
AND SOME M. D. C. SUPPORTERS HAVE TOLD 
US THEY WILL BE TOO AFRAID TO VOTE 
IN LEBANON HEZBOLLAH FIGHTERS HAVE 
BEGUN WITHDRAWNING FROM THE STREETS 
OF BEIRUT ENDING FOUR DAYS OF 
VIOLENCE EARLIER THERE WERE MORE 
CLASHES BETWEEN PRE AND ANTI 
GOVERNMENT FORCES UP TO TWELVE PEOPLE 
DIED IN NORTHERN LEBANON AND SIX 
WERE KILLED AT A FUNERAL IN THE 
CAPITAL 
WITH THE DEAD BEING BURIED AND MORE 
KILLED TODAY THE LEADERS SEEM TO 
WANT TO RESTORE CALM IN PARTS OF 
BEIRUT THEY WILL HAVE TO DAMPEN 
DOWN SECTARIAN HATRED THE SHOOTING 
WAS TO HONOUR A YOUNG SUN ANY 
MUSLIM MAN KILLED IN THE FIGHTING 
WITH HEZBOLLAH WHICH IS A SHI ITE 
MOVEMENT BUT A LITTLE LATER THE 
ARMY MOVED IN AFTER A LOCAL 
SHOPKEEPER A SHI ITE FIRED AT 
THE PROCESSION KILLING SEVERAL SUN 
ANY MOURNERS HIS SHOP WAS BURNT 
OUT AFTER THE ARMY ARRESTED HIM 
LOCAL PEOPLE CURSED HEZBOLLAH'S 
LEADER 
HE SAID HE WILL NEVER USE LEADER HIS WEAPONS INSIDE LEBANON WHAT WE 
SEE YESTERDAY WHAT WE SEE THESE 
PEOPLE WHO DIE WHY FOR WHAT 
REASON 
AND THE PRIME MINISTER IN A REASON TELEVISED SPEECH ALSO ASKED WHAT 
HEZBOLLAH WAS DOING IN BEIRUT'S 
ALLEYWAYS THE REAL ENEMY HE SAID 
WAS ISRAEL BUT THE LEBANESE HAVE A 
GOVERNMENT WHICH IS MORE LIKE A 
FACTION AND ARE LOOKING INTO WHAT 
ONE MAN TOLD ME WAS A FRIGHTENING 
VOID BEIRUT FEELS UNSTABLE A FEW 
MINUTES AGO WE FILMED A GROUP OF 
GUNMEN WHO WERE DRAGGING A MAN OUT 
OF A BUILDING AND TAKING HIM AWAY 
WHEN THEY SAW WHAT WE WERE DOING 
THEY TURNED ON US AND A VERY NASTY 
SITUATION WAS ONLY DIFFUSED WHEN WE 
RERACED THE PICTURES THERE IS A 
LOT OF TENSION ON THE STREETS THE 
LEBANESE ARMY PROTECTING A 
DEMONSTRATION BY JOURNALISTS DIDN'T 
INTERVENE IN THE FIGHTING THIS WEEK 
TRYING TO STAY NEUTRAL AND BOTH 
SIDES SEEM TO HAVE ACCEPTED ITS 
PEACE PLAN HEZBOLLAH'S FIGHTERS 
ARE OFF THE STREETS BUT THE 
GOVERNMENT'S MEASURES TO KERB 
HEZBOLLAH'S POWERS ARE RESCINDED 
THE MIDDLE EAST CRISIS HAS ANOTHER 
LAYER AND THE LEBANESE DEALING WITH 
THE BLOODY HANG OVER 
HERE THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN 
MAY SUFFER WHAT TEACHING UNIONS ARE 
CALLING EXAM CONGESTION IN THE NEXT 
FEW WEEKS SOME PUPILS WILL SPEND 
UP TO SEVEN HOURS SITTING THREE OR 
FOUR EXAMS IN A SINGLE DAY 
SOME SIX HUNDRED FIFTY COUPLES WITH FORTY THREE THOUSAND YEARS 
OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN THEM HAVE BEEN 
RENEWING THEIR VOWS AT A SPECIAL 
MASS AT WESTMINSTER CATHEDRAL THE 
ARCHBISHOP SAID THE INSTITUTION OF 
MARRIAGE IS DEEPLY IMPORTANT TO 
BRITAIN'S FUTURE 
FOR BETTER FOR WORSE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY COUPLES 
WITH FORTY THREE THOUSAND YEARS OF MARRIAGE 
BEHIND THEM PEOPLE LIKE THE 
O'DRISCOLLS CHILDHOOD SWEETHEARTS 
WHO TODAY REPEATED THE DIFFICULT 
PROMISES THEY MADE SIXTY ONE YEARS AGO 
BUT THEY ARE A DYING BREED 
MARRIAGE IS AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL 
EVER FORTY PER CENT END IN DIVORCE 
I OFTEN 
CALL IT A TIME BOMB BECAUSE I THINK 
THAT THE EFFECTS OF THE BREAK UP OF 
MARRIAGE CAN BE SEEN BECAUSE OF 
DRUGS OF CRIME SO MANY PEOPLE ARE 
IN PRISON AND THOSE NOT IN PRISON 
ARE THE RESULT OF BROKEN MARRIAGES 
THE O'DRISCOLLS SAY TOO FEW PEOPLE 
ARE READY TO WORK AT STAYING 
TOGETHER 
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG IT TOGETHER IS NO GOOD BRUSHING THINGS ASIDE 
JUST SPEAK ABOUT IT IF YOU LEAVE 
IT THINGS GET WORSE 
TWO LITTLE 
WORDS YES DEAR 
BURT AND ESTHER BUCKINGHAM KNEW FIFTY 
YEARS AGO THAT MARRIAGE WOULD BE NO 
PIECE OF CAKE 
IT IS NOT ALL 
SUNSHINE AND ROSES REALLY AND AND POSSIBLY THEY ARE AFRAID TO COMMIT 
THEMSELVES PERMANENTLY I THINK AND 
IF THEY DON'T GET MARRIED THEY CAN 
SEE IT IS AN EASY WAY TO BREAK UP 
IF THEY HAVE TO 
MANY OF THESE 
PARTNERSHIPS DATE FROM A TIME WHEN 
MARRIAGE WAS ACCEPTED AS THE 
BEDROCK OF SOCIETY THE CHURCHES 
SAY IT REMAINS AS ESSENTIAL FOR 
FAMILY LIFE AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF 
LOSING IT COULD BE DISASTROUS FOR 
US ALL
