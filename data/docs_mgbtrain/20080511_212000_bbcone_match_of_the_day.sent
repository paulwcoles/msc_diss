GOOD EVENING THE FINAL DAY OF THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE SEASON AND IT COULD 
HARDLY HAVE BEEN CLOSER OR MORE 
TENSE AT EITHER END OF THE TABLE 
TONIGHT WE ENDEAVOUR TO TELL THE 
STORY OF THE LAST NINETY MINUTES OF AN 
EXTRAORDINARY SEASON SO REMARKABLE 
WE THOUGHT TWO PUNDITS WERE NOT 
DONE IT JUSTICE SO WITH US TONIGHT 
ALAN HANSEN ALAN SHEARER AND MARK 
LAWRENSON WE KICK OFF WITH THE 
TIGHTEST PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE RACE 
IN HISTORY WITH THE GOAL 
DIFFERENCE ADVANTAGE MANCHESTER 
UNITED OR WALKED OUT AT WIGAN 
KNOWING THAT A WIN WOULD SEE THEM 
DEFEND THEIR TITLE ANYTHING LESS 
AND CHELSEA COULD CAPITALISE 
AGAINST BOLTON WE START WITH THE 
CHAMPIONS AT THE JJB STADIUM THIS IS THE WIGAN TEAM THAT STANDS 
IN THE WAY OF MANCHESTER UNITED'S 
TENTH PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME THEY HAVE MINOR FIGURE 
ROWER ON LOAN SINCE JANUARY AT 
MAINE OR FIGURE ROWER WE KNEW 
RONALDO WOULD PLAY BUT ALEX 
FERGUSON BLUFFED RUSSELL WITH TALES 
OF WAYNE ROONEY ONLY BEING FIT 
ENOUGH TO MAKE THE BENCH BLUFFED 
US ALL WAYNE ROONEY RETURNS TO RE 
ESTABLISH THE MANCHESTER UNITED 
MODERN DAY HOLY TRINITY ROONEY 
RONALDO AND CARLOS TEVEZ AND SO 
IT ALL BEGINS THE TITLE IS 
MANCHESTER UNITED'S TO LOSE THEY 
ARE ONE WIN AWAY FROM THEIR TENTH 
PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE THEY HAVE NOT 
WON ANY OF THEIR LAST FOUR GAMES 
AWAY FROM OLD TRAFFORD THEY FULLY 
EXPECT TO MAINTAIN THEIR ONE HUNDRED 
PERCENT RECORD AGAINST WIGAN 
ATHLETIC RYAN GIGGS HAS TO WAIT TO EQUAL SIR 
BOBBY CHARLTON'S RECORD FOR A 
NUMBER OF APPEARANCES FOR 
MANCHESTER UNITED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT IT WILL BE 
IF HE GETS ON TODAY PAUL SCHOLES CRUTCHES THROUGH 
WILSON PLASSEY ALSO HE IS NOT 
IMPRESSED BY THE HONDURAS 
INTERNATIONAL'S ROLLING AROUND A 
YELLOW CARD FOR PAUL SCHOLES THAT 
HIS WIFE IT THAT HIS WIFE HE DID NOT GET 
ANY OF THE BALL AT ALL TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
AGO SIR ALEX FERGUSON'S ABERDEEN 
BEAT REAL MADRID IN THE EUROPEAN 
CUP WINNERS' CUP FINAL IN 
GOTHENBURG A SIGNIFICANT ANNIVERSARY IT WAS A BIG TROPHY THAT BORED HIM 
TO THE ATTENTION OF THE WORLD 
ABROAD HIM EDWARD VAN DER SAR 
TOUCHES IT OVER THE TOP EDWIN 
VAN DER SAR IT WAS ALMOST THE 
SOFTEST OF GOALS AGAINST MANCHESTER 
UNITED MARCUS BENT HELPING IT ON EMMERSON BOYCE SWUNG DELAYED AT IT 
A LEG IS THIS AN AFTER HIM FOR 
THE MOST UNLIKELY OF HEROES AND 
VILLAINS AFTERNOON A CORNER TO WIGAN ANY SUGGESTIONS 
OF A PENALTY HERE NO IT HIT HIM 
TO HIGHER UP DEFINITELY SHOULDER A CLEAR FOUL TACKLE FROM BEHIND 
WITH LITTLE PROSPECT OF WINNING THE 
BALL CLEANLY MANCHESTER UNITED 
FREE KICK IT MUST BE AT LEAST THIRTY FIVE 
YARDS FROM GOAL CHRIS KIRKLAND KEEPS RONALDO OUT NOT THE BEST FREE KICK THAT RONALDO 
HAS EVER HIT BUT HOW MUCH DID 
CHRIS KIRKLAND SEA OF IT HE HAD TO STRETCH THOSE ARMS TO BEAT THE BALL AWAY 
AN EARLY GOAL FOR CHELSEA WOULD 
HAVE PUT THE PRESSURE ON MANCHESTER 
UNITED JOHN MOTSON OF PICKS UP 
THIS STORY AT STAMFORD BRIDGE GARY CAHILL DID NOT WAIT FOR HIS 
GOALKEEPER HE HAD TO GET IT AWAY 
AND HE DID HE HAS MISSED IT THAT IS TWICE HE HAS THREATENED ON 
THE FAR POST AND HE COULD HAVE PUT 
CHELSEA AHEAD MICHAEL BALLACK WITH 
THE CROSS DIDIER DROGBA COULD NOT 
STRETCH IT FLEW OFF HIS RIGHT FOOT 
BEHIND THE GOAL THAT IS THE SORT 
OF BALL BUT KEVIN DAVIES THRIVES ON PETR CECH WAS SEVENTEEN YARDS OUT OF HIS 
GOAL AND THERE IS AN INJURY TO 
JOHN TERRY BUT A CHEQUE CAME A 
LONG WAY TO CLAIM IT JOHN TERRY 
GOT THE WORST OF IT KEVIN DAVIES 
UP WITH HIM I THINK IT IS PETIT 
CHECK'S KNEE THAT HAD THE BIGGEST 
IMPACT YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHEN JOHN 
TERRY GOES DOWN IT IS PRETTY 
SERIOUS AVRAM GRANT DOES NOT WANT 
TO LOSE HIS CAPTAIN L. THINK HE 
WILL HAVE TO GO OFF THE CAPTAIN IS 
CARRIED OFF IT LOOKS LIKE HIS ARM 
AVRAM GRANT HAS GOT TO EARN HIS 
MONEY HERE HOW DOES HE RESHUFFLED 
THE CHELSEA DEFENCE CHELSEA HAVE GOT A FREE KICK JUST ONE OF THE POST INFORMATION 
ABOUT JOHN TERRY IS THAT HE HAS 
GONE TO HOSPITAL FOR AN X. RAY ON 
HIS ARM A BIG BLOW FOR CHELSEA DOWN GOES WAYNE ROONEY IT IS A PENALTY THE REFEREE WILL NOT CHANGE HIS 
MIND WIGAN ARE ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS 
WITH THE DECISION I DO NOT SUPPOSE IT HAS GONE DOWN 
ALL UP WELL IN CHELSEA EITHER L. 
DO NOT THINK THERE IS AN ARGUMENT 
EMMERSON BOYCE PUT HIS LEG UP 
ACROSS WAYNE ROONEY HE IS NOWHERE 
NEAR THE BALL AND HE TAKES WAYNE 
ROONEY OUT MANCHESTER UNITED AND 
CRISTIANO RONALDO HAD THE CHANCE TO 
TAKE ONE ENORMOUS STEP TOWARDS 
RETAINING THEIR PREMIER LEAGUE 
TITLE HERE THE MAN WHO SCORED FORTY GOALS THIS SEASON IT IS RONALDO IT IS ADVANTAGE 
UNITED ON PREMIER LEAGUE THE DAY 
D. DAY THINK ABOUT THE PRESSURE ON THAT 
ONE KICK OF THE FOOTBALL WHEN YOU 
HAVE ALREADY FOUND THE NET FORTY TIMES 
IN A SEASON WHAT IS ONE MORE 
UNCONFINED JOY AMONGST THE 
MANCHESTER UNITED SUPPORTERS THEY 
THINK THEY ARE THEREFORE STOP IT IS 
RONALDO AGAIN THE NEWS COMING THROUGH FROM WIGAN 
IS THAT MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE THE 
ADVANTAGE SO AT THIS STAGE CHELSEA 
HAVE IT ALL TO DO AND MORE PAUL SCHOLES HAS ALREADY BEEN 
BOOKED HOW MUCH INTENT WAS THERE 
IN THAT DETOUR KAREN WILSON 
PALACIOS AND MADE SURE HE COULD NOT 
GET TOO FAR DOWN FIELD HE TOOK 
OUT WILSON PALACIOS WILL THIS JUST 
BE A FINAL WORD OR IS IT HIS FINAL 
ACTION TODAY IT IS A LECTURE NO 
MORE A LET OFF FOR PAUL SCHOLES 
WAS THERE A SIGH OF RELIEF COMING 
FROM CARLOS KIA 
THAT IS A 
FROM CARLOS KIA RUSH THAT IS A BOOKING THAT IS A YELLOW CARD THE REFEREE SAW THAT AS CLEARLY AS HE SAW THE PENALTY IT HAS HIT THE SIDE NETTING A 
TERRIFIC ATTEMPT ON THE VOLLEY 
FIRST TIME WITH WES BROWN FLINGING 
HIMSELF IN FRONT OF HIM HEROIC DEFENDING BY BOLTON A 
SUPERB INTERCEPTION BY JUNHUI 
O'BRIEN OTHERWISE CHELSEA WOULD 
HAVE BEEN IN FRONT A JUNHUI 
O'BRIEN HE HAS A DIFFICULT HALF 
TIME JOB AVRAM GRANT DOES HE USE 
ANY MORE OF HIS SUBSTITUTES PENALTY APPEALS FROM WAYNE ROONEY 
ADAMANT IT SHOULD BE A PENALTY 
INSTEAD IT IS A CORNER TO 
MANCHESTER UNITED WAYNE ROONEY 
CHARGED INTO THE FACE OF THE 
REFEREE TITUS BRAMBLE DID NOT GET ANY OF 
THE BALL NONE AT ALL HE HAS TAKEN 
PAUL SCHOLES OUT GREAT SAVE BY CHRIS KIRKLAND HE THOUGHT HE HAD SCORED WAYNE 
ROONEY THOUGHT HE HAD SCORED AND 
SEE A BIG PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE HE 
HAS BEATEN TITUS BRAMBLE BUT NOT 
CHRIS KIRKLAND A REACTION SAVE TO 
KEEP WITHIN IN THE GAME AND TICKET 
CHELSEA IN THE TITLE HUNT IT TO 
KEEP WIGAN IN THE GAME AND TO KEEP 
CHELSEA IN THE TITLE HUNT IT IS FOUR FOUR TWO IN THE SECOND HALF FOR CHELSEA FOR OUR MALOUDA WERE SO CLOSE THE 
BEST EFFORT WE HAVE SEEN FROM 
CHELSEA BY SOME WAY FLORENT 
MALOUDA AFTER I WAS SO CLOSE IT MAY HAVE CAUGHT THE BOLTON 
PLAYER'S FOOT THAT IS A DEFINITE 
SAVE FROM ALI AL HABSI BE THE LEFT 
HAND HE DOES NOT LOOK TOO 
OPTIMISTIC AT THE MOMENT THE 
CHELSEA OWNER AND NEITHER DOES 
AVRAM GRANT IT IS A CORNER DIDIER DROGBA HAD 
OPTIONS TO HIS LEFT BUT HE DID NOT 
NEED THEM IT WAS A STORMING RUN BY 
THE CENTRE FORWARD CLEAR OF ALL 
THE DEFENDERS ALI AL HABSI FLICK 
SARPEI ARMOUR AFFLICTS UP AN ARM 
AND IT IS A CORNER TO CHELSEA A 
CORNER ONCE MORE BOLTON SEEM TO GET SOMEBODY IN THE 
WAY EVERY TIME FREE CORNERS IN 
SUCCESSION FOR CHELSEA THREE 
CORNERS ANDRIY 
SHEVCHENKO CHELSEA BREAKTHROUGH IT IS ANDRIY SHEVCHENKO HE SCORED THE LAST GOAL 
IN THE JERSEY IN A RADIO RAIN HERE 
AND HE HAS GOT ONE TODAY THAT COULD 
MEAN SO MUCH TO AVRAM GRANT THERE 
WERE SO MANY RICOCHETS FROM THESE 
THREE CORNERS JOE COLE'S SHOT FLEW 
ACROSS THE BOX AND ANDRIY 
SHEVCHENKO JUST HAD TO TOOK IT IN 
FROM INSIDE THE SIX YARD BOX 
PERHAPS HE HAS REPAID SOME OF THE 
FAITH THAT WAS LOST IN HIM ANDRIY 
SHEVCHENKO BUT SIXTY TWO MINUTES GONE IT 
IS CHELSEA ONE TO ZERO BOLTON BUT THE GOAL 
WAS A LONG TIME COMING THE NEWS IS FILTERING AROUND THAT 
CHELSEA HAVE SCORED AS IT STANDS 
THEY WILL STILL BE CHAMPIONS HE 
KNOWS IT THEY KNOW THAT IT IS ON A 
KNIFE EDGE MANCHESTER UNITED CHANGE AND WHAT A 
SIGNIFICANT ONE IS RYAN GIGGS IS 
COMING ON TO EQUAL SO BOBBY 
CHARLTON'S RECORD SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MANCHESTER 
UNITED APPEARANCES IN THE NEXT TWENTY THREE 
MINUTES HE COULD SEE A RECORD TENTH 
PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE SUCCESS 
SIR BOBBY CHARLTON I WONDER IF SIR BOBBY CHARLTON'S MEMORY IS CAST 
BACK TO HIS RECORD 
HEADED OVER THE TOP EMILE HESKEY 
WITH THE BEST CHANCE HE HAS HAD 
THE ONLY CHANCE HE HAS HAD ALL 
AFTERNOON TOWERING ABOVE THEM ALL 
PINPOINT STUFF FROM KOUMAS VAN DER 
SAR LOOK AT HIS FACE LOOK AT HIS 
FACE HE THOUGHT THAT WAS IT 
THAT WAS AIMED AT THE GOALKEEPER 
IT HAS HIT THE BAR IS IT OVER THE 
LINE NO IT HAS BEEN CLEARED 
BOLTON NEARLY EQUALISING IN A MESSY 
GOAL MOUTH SITUATION PETER CECH 
REALLY AND A PATCH THAT STRAIGHT 
OUT TO A BOLTON PLAYER IT COMES AT 
YOU OFF THE BAR AND THEN STURLEY 
US HE GETS IN 
THERE OF 
HIS KNEE 
AND AWAY BY ASHLEY COLE STELLA 
EOS STILIAN ARCE HERE IS ROONEY RYAN GIGGS SCORES 
MANCHESTER UNITED SURELY HAVE 
RETAINED THEIR PREMIER LEAGUE CROWD 
AREN'T CROWN THEY COULD NOT BE A 
MORE FITTING GOAL SCORER IT IS 
GAME AND NUMBER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT FOR RYAN 
GIGGS EQUALLING SIR BOBBY 
CHARLTON'S RECORD MR. MANCHESTER 
UNITED RYAN GIGGS I THINK HE HAS 
JUST CLAIMED THE TITLE AGAIN FOR 
THE TENTH TIME IN HIS CAREER 
FERGUSON THINKS IT IS ALL OVER NOW 
RYAN GIGGS KNOWS THE GAME IS WON 
WELL IT SOUNDS TO ME AS THOUGH THE 
LAST FEW MINUTES OF THIS MATCH ARE 
GOING TO BE 
PLAYED OUT 
IN FRONT OF 
SOME VERY DISAPPOINTED CHELSEA 
SUPPORTERS BEARING IN MIND THE 
NEWS FROM WIGAN IT DOES NOT LOOK 
GOOD FOR AVRAM GRANT NOW NO GREAT 
SCENES OF CELEBRATION AT THE BRIDGE 
STEINSSON HAS THE BALL FOR BOLTON 
DAVIES HEADS ON TAYLOR IT IS A 
GOAL A GOAL FROM MATT TAYLOR AND 
BOLTON HAVE EQUALISED IN THE LAST 
MINUTE OF STOPPAGE TIME MATT 
TAYLOR HAS SCORED AN EQUALISER IN 
THE NINETY THIRD MINUTE TO ROB AVRAM GRANT 
OF VICTORY TO ROB AVRAM GRANT 
THE SHOT SEEMS TO GO THROUGH PETR 
CECH IT GOES IN OF HIS LEG SO 
CHELSEA ONE TO ONE ONLY SECONDS REMAINING 
SIR ALEX FERGUSON EMBRACES HIS 
STAFF MEMBERS IT IS GETTING BETTER 
AND BETTER FOR UNITED IT IS ALL 
OVER NOW BECAUSE BOLTON HAVE 
EQUALISED AT STAMFORD BRIDGE AND 
MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE WON IN WIGAN 
AND THEY HAVE RETAINED THEIR 
PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE THEY HAVE NOT 
ONLY WON THE LEAGUE THEY HAVE WON 
IT TODAY IN THE MOST FITTING STYLE 
IT SIMPLY HAD TO BE HAILED BY SO 
MANY AS THE COMPLETE FOOTBALLING 
OUTFIT AND THE BEST TEAM IN THE 
LAND MANCHESTER UNITED OVER THIRTY EIGHT 
GAMES HAVE PROVED AGAIN HAVE 
PROVED IT AGAIN ON THEY GO TO 
MOSCOW BUT TODAY IT IS ALL ABOUT 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE MANCHESTER 
UNITED'S TENTH LEAGUE TITLE 
MANCHESTER UNITED ARE THE TOP TEAM 
IN THE LAND 
BY MAGIC MAGIC IT WAS FANTASTIC 
WHAT A CHAMPIONSHIP MAGIC THE 
WAY WE PLAYED THE COMPETITION THE 
EMOTIONS UNTIL THE END IT WAS 
MAGIC TO BE IN THIS CUP 
THEY HAD A GREAT SEASON I WANT TO 
CONGRATULATE THEM THEY ARE THE 
CHAMPIONS THEY PLAYED VERY GOOD 
ESPECIALLY ALEX FERGUSON HE IS A 
GREAT MANAGER AND A GREAT PERSON I 
LIKE HIM VERY MUCH BUT WE DID A 
GOOD SEASON WE NEVER WERE IN THE 
FIRST PLACE BUT WE DID NOT HAVE 
THE CHANCE TO GET THERE BUT HOW WE 
HANDLED THE SITUATION THIS SEASON 
WE NEED TO BE PROUD 
THE EUROPEAN CUP STARTS TOMORROW 
UP I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE A 
DO OR DIE GAME 
WE HAVE TO WIN IS NOTHING 
SHORT OF WINNING WE HAVE TO WIN 
THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
SO UNITED HAVE RETAINED THEIR 
TITLE AND I SPOKE TO GOALSCORING 
HERO RYAN GIGGS 
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO 
TALK TO US CONGRATULATIONS A 
WONDERFUL MOMENT AND YOU HAVE 
EQUALLED BOBBY CHARLTON'S RECORD 
AND SCORED THE GOAL THAT 
PRACTICALLY CLINCH THE TITLE YOU 
MUST BE DELIGHTED 
YES OBVIOUSLY 
IT IS STILL NERVE RACKING TO GET A 
SECOND GOAL US DOWN A LITTLE BIT 
AND JUST REALLY CHUFFED FOR ALL OF 
THE LADS INVOLVED CALMED US DOWN 
A LITTLE BIT WE DESERVE IT WE 
HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD 
WHAT DOES 
IT MEAN TO YOU 
IT DOESN'T REALLY 
AFFECT THE WAY I AM PLAYING I AM 
REALLY PROUD WHEN I FINISHED AT 
THE MOMENT TROPHIES MEAN A LITTLE 
BIT MORE TO ME ONE TO ONE TODAY 
HOPEFULLY ANOTHER ONE IN TEN DAYS 
BUT OBVIOUSLY I AM REALLY PROUD TO 
BREAK SOMEONE LIKE SIR BOBBY'S 
RECORD WHO HAS WATCHED ME COME 
THROUGH THE YOUTH TEAM AND EQUAL 
SOMEONE WHO IS PROBABLY THE BEST 
PLAYER TO EVER PLAYED FOR THE CLUB 
IS EXTRA SPECIAL 
YOU HAVE PLAYED 
FOR SOME GREAT MANCHESTER UNITED 
SIDES OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS 
HOW DOES THIS ONE COMPARE 
WELL I 
THINK IT HAS GOT POTENTIAL TO BE 
ONE OF 
THE BEST L. THINK THE TEAM THE AGE OF THE TEAM IS VERY GOOD 
WE PLAY EXCITING FOOTBALL WE HAVE 
PLAYERS WHO TAKE PEOPLE ON SCORE 
GOALS BUT TO WIN TITLES YOU NEED 
A SOLID BASE AND WE HAVE GOT THAT 
AS WELL THAT IS HOW WE HAVE WON 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP THIS YEAR WITH 
THAT SOLID BASE WE HAVE GOT THE 
PLAYERS WHO CAN DAMAGE TEAMS AND 
SCORE GOALS 
LOOKING AHEAD TO THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE YOU WOULD LOVE TO 
DO THE DOUBLE 
YES WE CANNOT WAIT 
FOR THAT NOW WE WILL ENJOY TONIGHT 
CELEBRATE BUT THEN COME NEXT WEEK

MASSIVE GAME THEY DO NOT COME

THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US THANK THANK YOU YOU I AM SURE THE NIGHT WILL BE GOING 
ON I DON'T THINK THEY WILL BE 
WATCHING TONIGHT ONCE AGAIN 
MANCHESTER UNITED ONE THE BEST TEAM 
WON IT 
I THINK SO IF YOU ARE 
LOOKING FOR THE ATTRIBUTES TO WIN 
THEY HAVE GOT THEM ALL 
INDIVIDUALLY VERY STRONG 
COLLECTIVELY BRILLIANT A GREAT 
TEAM SPIRIT A FANTASTIC MANAGER 
GREAT STRENGTH AND DEPTH BEING 
VERY GOOD IS NOT ENOUGH TO WIN THIS 
TITLE YOU HAVE TO BE A GREAT SIDE 
AND THAT IS WHAT MANCHESTER UNITED 
ARE 
A WONDERFUL LE RACE THIS ARE YEAR 
IT HAS BEEN ENTHRALLING YOU YEAR HAVE TO GIVE CHELSEA CREDIT FOR 
PUSHING THEM ALL THE WAY THEY HAD 
A TOUGH START TO THE SEASON BUT 
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE PLAYERS THEY 
HAVE HAD HER HAD OUT AT DIFFERENT 
TIMES FOR INJURIES IT HAS CAUGHT 
UP WITH THEM THEY HAVE MISSED 
THOSE PLAYERS ARE STILL AN 
ENTERTAINING SIDE 
YES MANCHESTER 
UNITED DESERVE TO WIN IT ARSENAL 
WERE ONLY FOUR POINTS AWAY AT THE 
END THAT GAP IS VERY SMALL THE 
OTHER THING AS WELL ALAN WAS 
ALLUDING TO THE FACT THAT THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE MANCHESTER UNITED 
AND CHELSEA HAVE HAD TO BALANCE 
GETTING INTO THE FINAL WITH TRYING 
TO WIN EVERY SINGLE 
GAME AND I 
THINK THERE 
IS NO DOUBT THAT THE 
BEST FOOTBALLING TEAM WON IT THE THE THING ABOUT UNITED WHEN THEY HAVE 
A SETBACK THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLY 
GOOD AT PICKING THEMSELVES UP THEY 
GET BEATEN ON SATURDAY AND THEN 
THE NEXT WEEK YOU KNOW FERGUSON 
HAS GOT THEM ABSOLUTELY FIRED UP 
UNITED WON TODAY BUT IT COULD HAVE 
BEEN DIFFERENT 
WIGAN REALLY GAVE 
IT A GO FOR THE FIRST FIFTEEN TO TWENTY 
MINUTES YOU THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A 
DIFFERENT STORY THAT WAS HANDBALL FROM FERDINAND 
IF THAT WAS GIVEN THE RESULT COULD 
GO EITHER WAY STEVE BRUCE WAS NOT 
HAPPY WITH IT L. THINK THERE IS NO 
DOUBT BUT WAS ON ROONEY THE 
REFEREE GO AWAY I AM GIVING THIS 
PENALTY KICK HE WAS IN A GOOD 
POSITION RONALDO DISPATCHES THAT 
WITH CONSUMMATE EASE L. THINK THAT 
WAS A YELLOW CARD AND HE SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN OFF THE PITCH THEN THE 
NEXT INCIDENT STEVE BENNETT IS 
TALKING TO HIM THERE AND SAYING I 
AM LETTING IT GO I WILL GIVE YOU A 
WARNING AND THEN THIS HAPPENS WITH 
BRAMBLE AND SCHOLES THIS IS A 
STONE WALL PENALTY AS MUCH AS YOU 
WILL EVER SEE CREDIT TO THE 
ENGLISH PREMIERSHIP WIGAN GAVE IT 
TO GAVE IT A REAL GO IT COULD 
HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT 
UNITED HAVE 
HAD THE BIG THREE UPFRONT 
WHEN YOU 
CONSIDER UNITED SCORED EIGHTY GOALS 
THIS SEASON AND THESE TWO PLAYERS 
HAVE GOT FIFTY SEVEN OF THEM JUST WHEN 
THESE THREE ARE TIGHT THESE THREE 
HAVE BEEN THE DIFFERENCE L. 
PULLED SOME GOALS OUT FROM EACH OF 
THEM IS ROONEY SAINT JAMES'S 
PARK AGAINST NEWCASTLE BRILLIANT 
THE GAME WAS TIGHT JUST WHEN YOU 
NEED SOMETHING SPECIAL YOU WILL 
NEVER GET FED UP OF SEEING GOALS 
LIKE THAT ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE 
THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE MADE 
DIFFERENCE THEY HAVE A BIT MORE 
BRILLIANCE THAN ANYBODY ELSE AT 
HOME TO WEST HAM BRILLIANT L. HAVE 
JUST MENTIONED THREE GREAT PLAYERS 
HE IS THE GREATEST OUT OF THEM ALL 
WE HAVE GOT HIM CIRCLED THEIR 
LITTLE BITS OF MOVEMENT HERE AND 
THERE IT WAS GREAT THAT HE CAME ON 
TODAY IN HIS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT APPEARANCE 
EQUALLING SIR BOBBY'S RECORD SIR 
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHTH APPEARANCE WHAT A PLAYER 
HE HAS BEEN OVER THE YEARS HE HAS 
BEEN A TREMENDOUS PROFESSIONAL AND 
DESERVES EVERYTHING HE GETS 
SOMEONE RATHER SPECIAL TO 
CONGRATULATE HIM THERE 
GOOD GUYS 
CAN COME FIRST 
HE CONDUCTS HIMSELF 
SO WELL ON THE PITCH AND OFF THE 
PITCH 
YOU WOULD LIKE TO GIVE PITCH DEFENSIVE CREDIT 
ABSOLUTELY YOU 
CANNOT WIN WITHOUT A SOLID DEFENCE 
THE TWO CENTRE BACKS HAVE BEEN 
ULTRA IMPRESSIVE IN AS MUCH OF THE 
BACK EACH OTHER UP WATCH FERDINAND 
HERE INSIDE OUTSIDE AND 
BERBATOV GETS IN HERE FERNANDES IN 
BACK ON THE LINE THIS IS THE GAME 
AGAINST LIVERPOOL ABSOLUTELY 
BRILLIANT HE TAKES THEM DOWN THE 
LINE BRILLIANT ABSOLUTELY 
BRILLIANT THEN WE GO TO CHECKED 
AGAINST READING VIDIC AGAINST 
READING 
LOOK THIS FOR A BLOCK LOOK HOW QUICKLY HE GETS UP AND 
REACT BRILLIANT BRILLIANT 
DEFENDING TODAY I THINK THIS IS A 
FANTASTIC HEADER UNDER PRESSURE HE 
GETS IN THAT POSITION HE CLEARS 
THE DANGER AND THE TWO OF THEM HAVE 
BEEN ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING 
BEST CENTRE BACKS IN THE LEAGUE 
UNITED LEFT IT LATE TO 
CLINCH THE 
TITLE THE LAST DAY OF THE SEASON 
BUT THEY 
LEFT IT LATE 
AT IN 
NUMBER OF MATCHES WHICH IS 
ULTIMATELY VALUABLE POINTS HOW HOW LUCKY ARE THEY THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO 
SCORE LATE GOALS AS EVERYBODY 
KNOWS 
IT IS WHEN YOU ARE DOWN KNOWS ABSOLUTELY THAT IS THE GREAT THING 
ABOUT IT THIS IS EARLY IN THE 
SEASON TEVEZ GETS THIS GOAL THAT 
IS THE GREAT THING ABOUT THEM THEY 
MAKE SUBSTITUTIONS THEY ALWAYS 
MAKE ATTACKING SUBSTITUTIONS THEY 
ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO SCORE IT 
NEVER EVER STOPS AGAIN AGAINST 
DERBY THEY LOTS OF CHANCES 
THAT DAY AND ANOTHER THEN COMES UP 
WITH THE GOODS HERE AGAIN 
EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM IS ALWAYS 
POSITIVE AND IT IS ALWAYS FORWARD 
THEY ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT ARE 
GOING TO SCORE LOOK AT THAT GAME 
AGAINST BLACKBURN THE OTHER WEEK 
HERE IT IS NOW THEY HAD SO MANY 
CHANCES THEY COULD HAVE HAD TWO 
PENALTIES THEY COULD HAVE KNOCKED 
OFF THEY GOING TEVEZ GETS 
THE GOAL THEY HAVE GOT THIS 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC BELIEF WHICH 
IS WE WILL SCORE 
AMAZING THE LAST 
SIX WEEKS OF THE SEASON THEY HAVE 
NOT PLAYED THAT WELL THEY HAVE 
BEEN STRUGGLING A BIT BUT THEY 
KEEP CHURNING OUT THE RESULTS 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT STRENGTH AND 
DEPTH PLUS THE COMMITMENT 
NOW THE 
TWO SIDES ARE GOING TO DO BATTLE IN 
THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
BUT A 
COUPLE 
OF MAJOR INJURY CONCERNS FOR 
CHELSEA 
IT HAS BEEN A POOR DAY FOR CHELSEA THEM THEY NEED THESE TWO PLAYERS 
FIT JUST WATCH THAT YOU CAN SEE 
TERRY WHEN HE GOES DOWN HE IS 
ALREADY IN PAIN HE IS SCREAMING 
OUCH 
HE SAYS HE WILL BE FIT BUT OUCH OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT SO SURE 
I M. 
SURE IF YOU HAVE HAD A DISLOCATION 
OVER THE YEARS IT IS GOING TO TAKE 
SOME COMING BACK IF ANYONE CAN HE 
CAN 
I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE SENT JOHN 
TERRY HOME INSTEAD OF DOING THE 
LAP OF HONOUR 
WITHOUT THEM UNITED 
ARE THE FAVOURITES 
WITHOUT A 
SHADOW OF A DOUBT BUT IF THEY ARE 
FIT AND READY CHELSEA COULD HAVE 
THE LAST LAUGH 
BUT MANCHESTER 
UNITED HAVE WON THE FIRST ONE 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY IT MAKES A BIG 
DIFFERENCE 
I THINK THE DIDIER DIFFERENCE DROGBA NEEDS TO BE FIT FOR CHELSEA 
HE CAN BULLY TEAMS AND FORCED SO 
MANCHESTER UNITED REMAIN THE 
BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE CHAMPIONS 
BUT FOR MANY SUPPORTERS WHO WOULD 
STAY UP AND HE WOULD GO DOWN 
ONLY ONE OF THREE COULD SURVIVE 
FULHAM WENT TO PORTSMOUTH THEM AND 
A WIN WOULD KEEP THEM UP ANYTHING 
LESS AND READING WERE BEST PLACED 
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE AT DERBY SHUT 
NEITHER FON NOR BREADING WHEN 
BIRMINGHAM COULD STILL ESCAPE AT 
HOME TO BLACKBURN WE STOP AT 
FRATTON PARK WITH JONATHAN PEARCE 
WE START VERY CLOSE THAT SORT OF MOMENT COULD MEAN THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SURVIVAL AND 
RELEGATION A REALLY GOOD SAVE A WHOLE SEASON BOILS DOWN TO NINETY MINUTES FOR THE HOME SIDE JUST OVER TWO AND ONE HALF MINUTES ON THE 
CLOCK AND THEY THOUGHT THERE WERE 
ABOUT TO GET THEIR NOSES IN FRONT 
A LOVELY EXCHANGE GOOD PLAY BY 
MAURO ZARATE IT CULT OF THE 
OUTSIDE OF HIS BOOT AND WIDE HAD 
IT GONE STRAIGHT AND TRUE IT MIGHT 
HAVE GONE IN A GOOD SAVE BY ROY CARROLL THE 
FLAG STAYS DOWN LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
AS THE BALL IS PLAYED FOR WORK 
LEROY LITA ARE JUST HELD ON HE 
COULD NOT QUITE PUSH IT ROUND THE 
GOALKEEPER LEROY LITA LOOKING 
LIVELY THOUGH STEVE COPPELL 
WHOSE FACIAL EXPRESSION DOES NOT 
REALLY CHANGED AT ALL READING ARE HEAD WHAT A BIG GOAL 
JAMES HARPER HAS CAUSED READING 
FIND THE NET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
SEVEN MATCHES FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE ITS TWENTY SECOND MARCH TWENTY SECOND MARCH 
DAVE KITSON WITH THE LAY OFF JAMES 
HART BUT HE DID UP AND ROY CARROLL 
COULD NOT KEEP THAT OUT IT IS NOT ONLY IN READING'S HANDS 
BUT THAT GOAL COULD BE WORTH 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS SOMEHOW HE WILL HAVE THE NEWS GIVEN 
TO HIM THAT READING ARE HEAD AT 
DERBY 
DERBY 
DERBY 
DERBY 
DERBY 
DERBY THEY 
WILL KNOW 
WHAT IT MEANS THE NEWS FROM ELSEWHERE IS THAT 
READING ARE IN FRONT AT PRIDE PARK 
AGAINST DERBY HE KNOWS THAT THAT 
MEANS BIRMINGHAM WILL GO DOWN 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY DO IT HAS GONE IN OF ALL THE UNLIKELY 
SCORERS IT IS DAVID MURPHY OF ALL 
THE UNLIKELY GOALKEEPERS TO MAKE A 
MISTAKE IT IS BRAD FRIEDEL DAVID 
MURPHY WITH HIS FIRST GOAL FOR THE 
CLUB HOW GOOD IS GOING IN HOW 
DID THIS GO IN AT IT DIPPED AND 
BOUNCED IS THAT THE BIT OF LUCK 
THAT BIRMINGHAM CITY HAD BEEN 
WAITING FOR RAY LEWINGTON WILL KNOW THAT 
BIRMINGHAM HAD TAKEN THE LEAD 
AGAINST BLACKBURN 
BIRMINGHAM HAD TAKEN THE LEAD AGAINST BLACKBURN 
AND THAT READING 
ON LEADING AT 
DERBY 
AGAINST BLACKBURN AND THAT READING ON LEADING AT DERBY 
IT IS PAINFUL FOR THE FANS THEY 
WILL KNOW 
THAT THEY ARE ON TOP OF A 
QUICKLY OPENING TRAP DOOR FULHAM WHO STARTED 
THE LAST DAY IN THE STRONGEST POSITION OF ALL ARE TEETERING ON THE BRINK OVER IT GOES THE GOALKEEPER DID WELL RACING OUT AND AT HALF TIME ROY HODGSON'S 
FULHAM ARE STARING AT RELEGATION 
THEY HAVE NOT REALLY GOT GOING HERE 
AGAINST A PORTSMOUTH SIDE WEEK 
AHEAD OF GOING TO WEMBLEY IN THE F. A. 
CUP FINAL APPEAL BUT SCORELINES 
GOING AGAINST THEM AT DERBY AND 
THEN AGAIN ZERO TO ZERO HERE MEANS THE 
FULHAM FANS WILL BE WATCHING 
CHAMPIONSHIP FOOTBALL NEXT SEASON WHAT A FORTY FIVE MINUTES FOR BIRMINGHAM 
MANAGER ALEX MCLEISH HE CAN ONLY 
IMPLEMENT THIS GAME BUT IT IS NOT 
THIS GAME THAT REALLY MATTERS 
BIRMINGHAM CITY OF ONE GOAL FROM 
SAFETY THEIR PROBLEM IS IT IS A 
DERBY COUNTY GOAL AS RESULTS THAN 
BIRMINGHAM CAN ONLY STAY UP IF THEY 
WIN AND DERBY COUNTY TURN IT AROUND 
AGAINST READING ONE TO ONE BIRMINGHAM ARE IN REAL TROUBLE 
NOW MORTEN GAMST PEDERSEN FOR 
BLACKBURN ROVERS SILENCE FOUR SAINT 
ANDREWS DAMIEN JOHNSON'S MISTAKE 
HE LOST HIS FOOTING AT THE CRUCIAL 
MOMENT MAIK TAYLOR WITH HEROICS 
TWO SAVES ROQUE SANTA CRUZ WITH 
THE AWARENESS TO GIVE IT TO MORTEN 
GAMST PEDERSEN WHITE AT THE START 
OF THE SECOND HALF IT IS A HAMMER 
BLOW TO BIRMINGHAM CITY THE FANS LOOK FOR SALVATION FROM SOMEWHERE FULHAM FANS BEHIND THE GOAL OF TRYING TO CIRCUIT IN SOCKET IT FULHAM HAVE BEEN JITTERY THROUGHOUT BUT SAFE OFFSIDE AGAINST JERMAIN 
DEFOE AS HE WENT TO CLOSE IN ON THE 
REBOUND THE REFEREE HAS SEEN THE 
FLAK NIKO KRANJCAR STRUCK IT WELL THE WHOLE NATION SEEMS TO BE 
GRIPPED BY PREMIER LEAGUE FEVER AS 
A CHILD YOU HATE WATCHING TIME 
DRIBBLE AWAY ON CHRISTMAS DAY OR A 
BIRTHDAY AND IT MUST BE LIKE THAT 
NOW FOR FULHAM FANS CAN THEY 
CHANGED TIME THEY HAVE CORNER KICK ONE BY DIOMANSY KAMARA FOOTBALL FANS IN OVER TWO HUNDRED COUNTRIES ARE WATCHING THIS GRIPPING DRAMA FULHAM THOUGHT PERHAPS THAT WAS THEIR MOMENT IF READING AT CORNELL YOU CANNOT 
REALLY SEE DERBY COMING BACK INTO 
IT READING COULD SCORE NOW A GREAT CHANCE AND DAVE KITSON 
SCHOOLS TWO TO ZERO TO READING SURELY 
THEY WILL TAKE THE THREE POINTS 
AND SURELY NOW IT WILL ALL COME 
DOWN TO WHAT FULHAM ARE GOING TO DO 
ON THE SOUTH COAST HALF AN HOUR TO GO AND READING'S FANS HAVE REAL HOPE THE SHOT FROM NICKY SHOREY 
SCRAMBLED AWAY BY ROY CARROLL 
LEROY LITA FROM THE TIGHTEST OF 
ANGLES PORTED ACROSS AND DAVE 
KITSON CANNOT MISS IT IS ONLY THE 
SECOND TIME HE HAS SCORED SINCE THE 
TURN OF THE YEAR BUT WHAT A TIME 
TO SCORE WITH EVERY PASSING MINUTE 
THE PRESSURE PILES UP ON ROY 
HODGSON AND FULHAM HE LOOKS AS THOUGH HE IS FEELING 
THE PRESSURE NOW MORE THAN WHEN IT 
WAS THE RIGHT TO ZERO PLAY UP 
POMPEY IS THE CRY FROM THE READING 
FANS IT IS IN THREE TO ZERO THREE GOALS THREE 
POINTS BUT WILL THEY BE ENOUGH TO 
KEEP READING UP SIXTY NINE MINUTES THE 
TIME OF THE GOAL THREE GOALS FOR 
READING AND IT IS KEVIN DOYLE WHO 
GETS THE THIRD WHAT AN IMPACT BY 
THE SUBSTITUTE 
AS THE BALL CAME INTO THE CENTRE 
MAREK MATEJOVSKY WENT 
FOR THE BALL 
AND KEVIN DOYLE BEATS HIM TO IT THE CURTAIN IS COMING DOWN ON 
BIRMINGHAM IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
READING OF THREE TO ZERO UP AT PRIDE PARK 
SHOUTS NOW OF WHERE HAS THE MONEY 
GONE AND SACKED THE BOARD AN 
UNCOMFORTABLE AFTERNOON INDEED FOR 
THOSE AT THE TOP AT SAINT ANDREWS CAMERON JEROME HAS MISSED IT HOW HAS HE MISSED IT INCREDIBLE MISS YOU COULD DO THAT ONE HUNDRED TIMES AND SCORED NINETY NINE OF THEM BUT NOT AT ONE NOT THAT ONE IT WAS THE MOST 
APPALLING IS BUT CAN BIRMINGHAM 
MAKE AMENDS CAMERON JEROME HAS 
SCORED HE WILL BE RELIEVED MAN THE MISS 
OF THE SEASON FOLLOWED SWIFTLY BY 
A GOAL HOW DO YOU MISS THE FIRST 
ONE AND SCORED HIS SECOND THIS IS 
MCBRIDE HE GETS THE CROSS IN LOOKING FOR MCBRIDE THAT WAS SO CLOSE AND IT 
CAME OFF THE DEFENDER A FRACTION 
BETWEEN SURVIVAL AND DESPAIR THE 
PRESSURE IS BUILDING WAS THERE 
NIGER EVENTUALLY IT IS LIFTED 
AWAY BOLLARD FULHAM ARE CAUSING 
PROBLEMS NOW BY LARGE BULLARD 
FULHAM HAVE WON FIVE OF THEIR SEVENTEEN 
LEAGUE GAMES UNDER THEIR MANAGER 
IT TOOK THEM A WHILE TO GET THEM 
PLAYING AS HE WANTED THEM TO PLAY A FREE KICK OR FULHAM FOR WHOM 
TIME IT IS DRIBBLING AWAY WITH 
BIRMINGHAM LEADING BLACKBURN TWO TO ONE 
AND READING HEADING FOR SAFETY THREE TO ONE 
UP AT DERBY FULHAM NEED TO SCORE 
TO TURN IT ALL AROUND THEIR WAY 
AGAIN MURPHY HEADER FULHAM TAKE 
THE LEAD IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
ATTACKS OF THE SEASON FOR TWO 
RUPERT MCCOMB FORTY MINUTES TO GO 
FOURTEEN THAT IS PERHAPS THE BIGGEST 
GOAL OF HIS CAREER IT IS ALL 
SWINGING FULHAM'S WAY WAS THERE AN 
OFFSIDE IN THE MIDDLE MURPHY CAME 
FROM AN ONSIDE POSITION WHAT 
LOVELY HEADER IT WAS IT WAS A 
PEACH OF GOAL FROM ONE OF THE 
SMALLEST PLAYERS IN THE GROUND 
DANNY MURPHY HAS PUT FULHAM ONE TO ZERO UP 
AND FOURTEEN MINUTES AWAY FROM SAFETY 
AND I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
ABOUT TO BE SUBSTITUTED THAT COULD 
HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
DECISIONS OF THE SEASON AND FULHAM 
HAVE SCORED AT FRATTON PARK THE 
COLLECTIVE THERE HAS BEEN SUCKED 
OUT OF THE READING FANS BEHIND THE 
GOAL COLLECTIVE AIR SUDDENLY 
THEY ARE QUIET AND SUDDENLY THEY 
ARE ENTIRELY RELIANT ON PAUL SMITH 
COMING BACK INTO THE GAME 
READING WENT ON TO SCORE FORCE 
THROUGH LITA BUT THEY KNEW IF 
FULHAM HELD ON THEY WOULD BE 
RELEGATED RELEGATED MEANWHILE AT SAINT ANDREWS CAMERON 
JEROME AND FABRICE MUAMBA HER 
EXTENDED BIRMINGHAM'S LEAGUE TWENTY FOUR TO ONE 
BUT IT DID NOT MATTER THEY WERE 
DOOMED WHATEVER WAS TO HAPPEN AT 
FRATTON PARK THEY EXTENDED 
BIRMINGHAM'S LEEDS BY FOUR TO ONE IF 
THEY LEAD THE FULL TIME WHISTLE HAS BLOWN AT 
DERBY READING HAVE WON THEIR BY FOUR 
ZERO BUT IT WILL NOT MATTER AS LONG 
AS FULHAM HOLD ON TO THE LEAD HE WILL HOLD ON TO IT WILL HE HE 
RELEASES TO THE GOALSCORING HERO 
MURPHY BALAD WILL NOT WANT TO 
CONCEDE POSITION THIS LATE 
BOLLARD WE ARE INTO THE LAST HALF 
MINUTE OF STOPPARD STROHEIM 
STOPPAGE TIME SO MUCH FOOTBALL 
PLAYED IN THIS LONG MEANDERING 
FOOTBALL SEASON AND STILL IT HAS 
NOT BEEN DECIDED PENSIVE IT HAS NOT BEEN PRETTY IT HAS BEEN 
TIGHT AND TENSE AND GUT WRENCHING 
AND FOR FULHAM ABSOLUTELY 
DELICIOUS IT IS MURPHY'S LAW BUT 
KEEPS AL FAYED IN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE DANNY MURPHY SCORING A FOURTEEN 
MILLION GOAL WITH FOURTEEN MINUTES TO GO 
AT FRATTON PARK PORTSMOUTH THE 
CUP FINALISTS GO TO WEMBLEY ON THE 
BACK OF ANOTHER DEFEAT DANNY 
MURPHY WILL BE BATHING IN SUNSHINE 
SOMEWHERE AND SO WILL THEY AND 
BATHING IN THE EXPECTANCY OF 
ANOTHER PREMIER LEAGUE SEASON TO 
COME IT IS SMILES FOR FULHAM AND 
AT THE END OF THIS LONG TEN MONTHS 
LOVE IT IS TEARS FOR READING AND 
BIRMINGHAM AND IT IS FULHAM WHO 
STAY UP WITH ONE TO ZERO WIN AT PORTSMOUTH PORTSMOUTH AND THE CHEERS ARE CHEERS OF 
SADNESS THE FINAL WHISTLE HAS GONE 
AT FRATTON PARK FULHAM HAVE BEATEN 
PORTSMOUTH BY ONE TO ZERO AND READING ARE 
RELEGATED THESE PROUD AND 
PASSIONATE BRUMMIE SUPPORTERS WILL 
BE MISSED NEXT SEASON IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE IT IS STARTING TO 
BE A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH FOR SOME 
WE BELIEVE WE COULD PUT ON A GOOD 
PERFORMANCE THAT WAS VERY 
IMPORTANT TO ME AFTER LAST WEEK 
WE WANTED TO PUT ON AN OUTSTANDING 
PERFORMANCE BUT NORMALLY IF YOU 
PUT ON AN OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE 
THE RESULT FOLLOWS 
I THOUGHT WE 
HAD A FEELING THIS WEEK THERE IF WE 
DID OUR STUFF AND GOT THREE POINTS 
WE WOULD HAVE A REAL CHANCE OF 
PLAYING IN THIS DIVISION NEXT YEAR 
WE DID THE PLAYERS DID ALL WE 
ASKED OF THEM IT WAS A GOOD 
PERFORMANCE GOOD RESULTS IT WAS 
AN ENJOYABLE DAY'S FOOTBALL 
WE END 
UP STAYING UP AT THE COST OF OTHER 
TEAMS THEY MUST BE BITTERLY 
DISAPPOINTED MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH 
THEM FOR SOME PERIODS IN THE GAME 
I WAS CONTEMPLATING HIS POST MATCH 
INTERVIEW WOULD BE DISCUSSING OUR 
FUTURE I AND THE LUCKY ONE SO MY 
THOUGHTS GO OUT TO THEM 
WHEN THE 
CROWD ARE DISAPPOINTED IT IS VERY 
DISAPPOINTING WE HAVE WORKED 
RELENTLESSLY FOR THIS FOOTBALL CLUB 
WHETHER IT IS TIME FOR ME TO RESIGN 
AS CHAIRMAN IS DIFFERENT FROM 
WALKING AWAY FROM THE FOOTBALL CLUB 
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT L. AM 
COMMITTED ONE HUNDRED PER CENT TO BIRMINGHAM CITY 
FOOTBALL CLUB BUT MAYBE IT IS TIME 
FOR ME TO STEP DOWN AS CHAIRMAN I I AM SO DISAPPOINTED THE WAY IT HAS 
GONE OUT IT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH L. 
THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME THE 
SUPPORTERS HAVE TURNED ON THEM 
THERE WERE ONE OR TWO BRUISE 
TOWARDS THE END YOU DISAPPOINTED 
BY THAT 
YES I CANNOT STAND THAT 
THEY JUST DON'T REALISE MOST OF 
THE GOOD PUNTERS STAYED ON AND SHE 
DID THE TEAM AND GOT BEHIND THE 
PLAYERS THEY REALISED WHAT WE HAVE 
DONE IT IS THOSE WHO HAVE JUMPED 
ON THE BANDWAGON THE LAST COUPLE OF 
YEARS WHO DO NOT KNOW 
IT IS FUNNY 
FOOTBALL MY LITTLE GIRL GOT TAKEN 
INTO HOSPITAL YESTERDAY MORNING AND 
IT WAS FIFTY TO FIFTY WHETHER I WAS GOING TO 
BE ABLE TO PLAY NOT THAT I AM 
LUCKY TO BE A HERO BUT IT IS 
PRIORITIES BY SATURDAY EVENING 
SHE WAS A LOT BETTER L. TRAINED 
LATE SATURDAY AND CAME WITH 
THE BOYS AND ENDED UP SCORING A 
WINNER SOMETIMES THINGS ARE 
WRITTEN IN THE STARS 
EMOTIONAL SCENES AND EXTRAORDINARY 
SCENES LOT OF THE TIME AND IT IS FULHAM THAT ESCAPE AND WE SHOULD 
HEAD IT WAS ALMOST EVERY 
SINGLE WEEK WE DID AN F. A. CUP MATCH 
AND LEE DIXON SAID I THINK FULHAM 
WILL STAY UP AND WE LAUGHED IT 
JUST GOES TO SHOW THEY HAVE DONE 
FANTASTICALLY UNDER ROY HODGSON L. 
THINK THE GREAT THING AS WELL IS 
THAT THEY PLAY FOOTBALL THEY HAVE 
GOT OUT OF THEIR DIVISION 
PLAYING FOOTBALL WHICH IS GREAT 
CREDIT TO HIM 
FOR ME WHEN THEY 
PLAYED MANCHESTER'S CITY A COUPLE 
OF WEEKS AGO TWO TO ZERO DOWN AND THEY 
CAME BACK THEY GOT THE POINTS AND 
THEY HAVE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF 
BELIEF A BIT OF CONFIDENCE FROM 
THEN ON MANCHESTER CITY THE THE FIRST GAME WAS NEW YEAR'S DAY THEY 
HAD ONE WIN IN NINE THE FIRST NINE 
GAMES HE HAS TURN THEM ROUND BOY 
HAD SON WHEN YOU SEE FULHAM PLAY 
I THOUGHT THEY WERE TERRIBLE 
DEFENSIVELY HE ERADICATED ALL THE 
PROBLEMS GOING THERE IN THE LAST 
FIVE OR SIX MATCHES THEY HAVE BEEN 
A BRILLIANT 
IT IS THE MOST 
UNLIKELY RESULT 
THEY HAVE WON THE 
LAST THREE GAMES AWAY FROM HOME IT 
IS A LITTLE BIT FORTUNATE THAT 
MCBRIDE AND BOLLARD WERE FIT THIS WAS AT READING THE TEAMS AT 
THE BOTTOM THEY HAVE BEATEN AS WELL 
THEY PLAYED VERY VERY WELL THAT DAY 
VERY VERY WELL THIS GAME AT 
MANCHESTER CITY THEY WERE 
RELEGATED AT THAT POINT AND THEN 
THEY SCORED TO WIN THE LAST THREE 
AWAY GAMES THEY WENT SOMETHING 
LIKE NINETEEN MUMS WERE THAT WINNING AWAY 
FROM HOME THAT TELLS YOU 
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW 
A WORD ON THE RELEGATED CLUBS 
THERE IS NOTHING WORSE 
READING GO 
TO DERBY AND WIN FOUR TO ZERO AND THEY ARE 
RELEGATED I THINK THE BIG THING IS 
THAT STEVE COPPELL SHOULD STAY ON 
BECAUSE IF HE LEAVES THEY WILL BE 
IN BIG TROUBLE THERE WAS A PEER IN 
THE SEASON WHEN EIGHT IN AND ANOTHER 
THEY 
COULD NOT SCORE FOR LOVE NOR MONEY 
WE SAW EVERYBODY AT SET THERE AND 
EMOTIONAL 
IT IS THE TAKEOVER THING EMOTIONAL THAT IS WHAT STARTED TO GO WRONG 
WITH BIRMINGHAM WHEN IT ALL 
STARTED BUT THE TAKEOVER WHEN IT 
NEVER HAPPENED THEY WANTED 
ASSURANCES ALL STEVE BRUCE WANTED 
ASSURANCES BUT HE WAS STILL BE 
THERE HE COULD NOT GIVE HIM THAT 
AND HE LEFT THEY COULD NOT GIVE 
HIM THAT 
IT GETS EVER TOUGHER 
DOESN'T IT 
I AM IN TROUBLE ALREADY 
I SAID THEY WERE ALL GOING TO 
STRUGGLE IT IS VERY HARD THE GAP 
GETS BIGGER THE QUALITY IS 
DIFFERENT AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING 
TO GET ENOUGH PLAYERS TO KEEP 
HERSELF IN THE DIVISION 
A GREAT 
EXAMPLE IS SUNDERLAND HAVE SPENT 
FORTY FIVE MILLION AND THEY HAVE SURVIVED 
BY THREE POINTS 
YOU ARE GAMBLING 
WITH THE VERY EXISTENCE OF YOUR 
CLUB 
THAT IS THE MINIMUM YOU HAVE CLUB TO SVEN THE GULF IS SO GREAT 
BETWEEN THE PREMIERSHIP AND THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP SO YOU HAVE TO SVEN 
MONEY 
HER FULHAM CONJURED UP MONEY GREAT ESCAPE BUT AS FOR PORTSMOUTH 
THEY HAVE THE F. A. CUP FINAL 
TO LOOK 
FORWARD TO 
BE AT WEMBLEY FOR THAT 
WE WILL BE AT WEMBLEY FOR THAT FULHAM 
WELL ONE MORE THING TO SETTLE AND 
THAT IS WHO WOULD GAIN A UEFA CUP 
SPOT NEXT SEASON UEFA NEEDED A 
DRAW OR BETTER AT HOME TO NEWCASTLE 
SHOULD THEY LOSE ASTON VILLA COULD 
CASH IN AT GOODISON PARK WAS 
ALASTAIR MAN AGRAMAN FOUR CHANGES FOR NEWCASTLE BUT 
MICHAEL OWEN IS FIT AND CAPTAIN HE 
IS LOOKING FOR A GOAL AT GOODISON 
FOR THE FOURTH PHYSIC IN A ROW 
VISIT IT SHOULD BE A BOOKING AND 
INDEED IT IS PETER WALTON 
I 
HAVE GOT NO CHOICE L. HAVE TO BOOK YOU FOR THAT YAKUBU IS THERE FOR THE OPENER AND 
EVERTON INCHED TOWARDS EUROPE A 
REALLY GOOD DELIVERY WHO WAS GOING 
TO ATTACK IT IT WAS YAKUBU HE 
PLANTED HIS HEADER COMFORTABLY ON 
STEVE HARPER EVERTON WHO NEED 
JUST A POINT TO ENSURE UEFA CUP 
FOOTBALL ARE ONE TO THE GOOD HERE 
IS OSMAN A LOOKING AT IT YOU WONDER WHETHER 
OR NOT IT WAS OFFSIDE THERE SEEMED 
TO BE TWO OR THREE NEWCASTLE 
PLAYERS CLOSE BY LOOKING AT IT EVERTON LOOKING FOR A SECOND BUT A GOOD SAVE BY HARPER CHANCE AFTER CHANCE TO GUARANTEE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL PERHAPS ONLY AN ARDENT LIVERPOOL 
FAN WOULD DENY THAT THEY DESERVE 
THEIR PLACE IN IT EUROPE WHAT A 
PENALTY AND WHAT A START TO THE 
SECOND HALF FOR THE VISITORS WHAT 
A BLOW FOR EVERTON MICHAEL OWEN 
SEEKING TO SCORE AT GOODISON PARK 
FOR THE FOURTH TIME IN A ROW AND IT 
SLIPS UNDER THE BODY OF TIM HOWARD 
AND NEWCASTLE ARE LEVEL THE IT WAS 
NOT A GREAT PENALTY BUT IT WENT 
UNDER TIM HOWARD AND INTO THE BACK 
OF THE NET HE WAS TALKING ABOUT 
INCREDIBLE STATISTIC THAT HIS SIDE 
HAVE NOT WON A PENALTY ALL SEASON 
BUT 
THE VISITORS TODAY HAVE A FREE KICK TO EVERTON THIS WAS THE CHALLENGE IT WAS ACTUALLY 
GIVEN BY THE ASSISTANT NOT BY THE 
REFEREE HE ACKNOWLEDGED 
THE SIGNAL JOLEON LESCOTT IT JUST HAD TO BE THE PLAYER OF THE YEAR AT GOODISON 
PARK HE GETS HIS TENTH GOAL OF THIS 
SEASON AND IN DOING SO HOW 
FITTING THAT HE HAS PROBABLY 
CEMENTED EUROPEAN FOOTBALL FOR THE 
CLUB HE JUST GUIDED IT LIKE A 
CENTRE FORWARD BEYOND STEVE HARPER IT IS A PENALTY THEY HAVE NOT WON A PENALTY ALL 
SEASON IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE AND 
ON THE LAST DAY LEON OSMAN IS 
FOULED BY STEVE TAYLOR GET YOUR PASSPORTS EVERTON YOU 
ARE GOING TO EUROPE IF YOU HAD 
WRITTEN A SCRIPT BEFORE THE START 
OF PLAY TODAY FROM AN EVERTON 
PERSPECTIVE YAKUBU WOULD HAVE GOT 
TO TWENTY GOALS JOLEON LESCOTT WOULD 
HAVE SCORED AND EVERTON WOULD HAVE 
WON THEIR FIRST PREMIER LEAGUE 
PENALTY OF THIS SEASON THEY HAVE 
DONE ALL THAT AND NOW THEY ARE 
GOING INTO THE UEFA CUP 
A BIG THANK YOU AND 
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE PLAYERS HOW 
WILL THEY HAVE PERFORMED FROM THE 
FIRST TO BE LAST THEY HAVE BEEN 
THERE THEY PLAYED REALLY WELL 
THEY PASSED THE BALL WE MADE LOTS 
OF OPPORTUNITIES BUT AS USUAL THEY 
MADE US HANG ON BIT 
THE LOTS OF 
SUPPORTERS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT 
LAST WEEK DO SPEAKING TO THE OWNER 
WILL HE BE PRESIDING OVER THIS 
SUMMER TRANSITION 
I DEFINITELY 
WILL IT WAS A VERY GOOD MEETING 
AND ONE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE L. 
WILL NOT COLLABORATE ON THAT 
ELABORATE IT WAS A GOOD MEETING L. 
TOLD THE THAT I AM STILL HERE AND I WILL BE HERE 
FIFTH FOR EVERTON YOU WAIT FOR CUP 
SPOT 
ONCE AGAIN THEY HAVE PUT HAD SPOT A MAGNIFICENT SEASON FOR US DAVID 
MOYES WILL WANT FINANCE DID TRY TO 
BREAK INTO THE TOP FOUR IT WILL BE 
VERY DIFFICULT 
WHAT WILL THEY NEED 
TO DO THAT 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
LIVERPOOL WHAT THEY SPEND ON 
FERNANDO TORRES LAST YEAR TWENTY SEVEN 
MILLION THEY STILL HAVE NOT GOT 
ANY NEARER TO WINNING THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP THAT IS ON ONE PLAYER 
WHAT WILL THEY HAVE TO SPEND TO 
CLOSE THE GAP 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT 
IF YOU ARE A PLAYER AND YOU COME TO 
ENGLAND AND YOU ARE A TOP CLASS 
PLAYER YOU GO TO THE BIG FOUR 
PLAYERS WILL COME FIRST OR MONEY 
AND THE BIG FOUR HAVE THE MOST 
MONEY THEN THEY COME FOR THE 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE EVERTON ARE UP 
AGAINST IT DAVID MOYES HAS DONE A 
MAP OF AS A JOB BUT THEY ARE A 
LONG WAY OF GETTING INTO THE TOP 
FOUR 
WILL KEVIN KEEGAN STATE FOUR STAY THAT NEEDED TO BE RESOLVED 
US IT HAD BEEN A SOAP OPERA GREAT 
NEWS FOR ALL OF THE FANS THE 
MEETING WENT VERY WELL IT IS 
SIMILAR TO AT EVERTON 
THEY NEED A 
FEW BOB SPENDING 
AT THE NEXT GAME SEES WHAT MIGHT 
TURN OUT TO BE SVEN GORAN 
ERIKSSON'S LAST GAME IN CHARGE AT 
MANCHESTER CITY THEY STARTED ON 
COURSE FOR A UEFA CUP VIA THE FAIR 
PLAY TABLE THEIR VISIT TO 
MIDDLESBROUGH WAS WATCHED BY JOHN 
RODDA THE LAST ARE BUT A GOOD MATCH IN 
CHARGE OF MANCHESTER CITY COULD SEE 
THEM CLAIMING YOU WHETHER CUP PLACE 
SOMETHING THEY WERE DENIED WHEN 
MARK SCHWARZER SAVED A PENALTY FROM 
MARK ROBBIE FOWLER ON THE LAST 
DAY OF THE SEASON THREE YEARS AGO IS THAT A PENALTY KICK YES IT IS RICHARD DUNNE COULD BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE HE IS OFF BEAUTIFUL BALL FORWARD ON TRIAL 
WITH THE TOUCH RICHARD DUNNE 
BROUGHT HIM DOWN CHARLES STANLEY 
WOULD BE TOUCHED WHAT A GOOD PENALTY MIDDLESBROUGH'S PLAY OFF THIS IS 
THEN PUT THEM ONE TO ZERO IN FRONT 
PLAYER OF THE SEASON IT IS HIS SECOND AFFONSO ALVES 
MANCHESTER CITY CARVED OPEN AT THE 
BACK MIDDLESBROUGH COMFORTABLY IN 
CHARGE AT THE RIVERSIDE HE WAS NOT 
GOING TO MISS FROM THERE HOW GOOD THAT NOT GOING ANDREAS ISAKSSON WITH A TERRIFIC STOP MANCHESTER CITY HAVE NOT LOST THREE 
IN SUCCESSION THIS SEASON WILL 
SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON DEPART THE CLUB 
ON THE BACK OF THREE DEFEATS IN A 
ROW STEWART DOWNING WHAT A GOAL BEAUTIFULLY ARCED AND FOR THE 
FIRST TIME THIS SEASON 
MIDDLESBROUGH GET THREE GOALS IN A 
MATCH A SUMPTUOUS GOAL FROM 
STEWART DOWNING IT TAKES HIM TO 
DOUBLE FIGURES FOR THE SEASON THIS 
IS A GOAL WORTH SEEING AGAIN AND 
AGAIN ADDRESS ISAACSON WAS NEVER DONE TO 
GET ON THE END OF THAT THE REFEREE 
HAS ASKED FOR THE FLOODLIGHTS TO BE 
PUT ON AT THE RIVERSIDE STADIUM 
THERE IS A SWIRLING MIST ALL AROUND 
THE GROUND IT IS ABSOLUTELY 
FREEZING AFONSO ALVES MATCHES THE STEWART 
DOWNING DEBORAH PAT TWO FOR THE 
AFTERNOON THEY BOTH HAVE TWO FOUR TO MIDDLESBROUGH A DEFLECTION AND IN ADAM JOHNSON 
JUST A FEW MINUTES AFTER COMING ON 
AS HIS SUBSTITUTE INFLICT FURTHER 
MISERY ON SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON 
ECLIPSE UP OF MICHAEL BALL IT 
LOOPS UP THAT IS A FREE KICK A FOUL BY 
STEPHEN IRELAND THIS IS IN A VERY 
PROMISING POSITION FOR 
MIDDLESBROUGH THEY HAVE GOT THE SIXTH GOAL ONE OF THE BEST FREE KICKS YOU ARE LIKELY TO SEE THIS SEASON FABIO ROCHEMBACK ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING A SUMPTUOUS EFFORT I AM SURE SVEN 
GORAN ERIKSSON WILL NOT SEE IT THAT 
WAY SEVEN MANCHESTER CITY HAVE ROLLED 
OVER AND CONCEDED SO MANY GOALS 
THIS AFTERNOON THAT IS AN UNSTOPPABLE SHOT FROM 
ELANO IT IS SOME CONSOLATION FOR 
MANCHESTER CITY BUT NOT MUCH SVEN 
GORAN ERIKSSON WILL BE HEARTENED BY 
THE ENORMOUS SUPPORT THAT 
MANCHESTER CITY SUPPORTERS HAVE 
SHOWN HIM IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS AFONSO ALVES AND THE HAT TRICK MIDDLESBROUGH END THEIR SEASON IN FINE STYLE MENTALLY WE WERE NOT ON THE PITCH 
I DO NOT THINK IT HAS ANYTHING TO 
DO WITH THE TACTICS OR PHYSICALITY 
BUT MENTALLY THE TEAM HAS TOTALLY 
GONE 
THE TWO BIG INFLUENCES WERE GONE OUR SITUATION THE PRESSURE OFF 
AND THE FREEDOM TO GO AND PLAY AND 
THEIR SITUATION A LOT OF 
UNCERTAINTY HAVING GONE DOWN TO TEN 
MEN WHAT WE SCORED THE THIRD WE 
BROKE THE RESISTANCE WE HAVE HAD 
ALL OF ALAN COOKE AND GOALS IN ONE 
AFTERNOON 
AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE AFTERNOON HAPPENS NOW 
I DO NOT THINK ANYONE 
KNOWS I DO NOT KNOW 
YOU ARE IN A 
STATE OF UNCERTAINTY OVER YOUR 
FUTURE 
THIS AND I HOPE FOR THE FUTURE CLUB AND THE PLAYERS EVERYONE 
EVEN FOR ME THAT WE RESOLVE THAT 
WITHIN HOURS OR DAYS BECAUSE TO 
LIVE IN UNCERTAINTY FOR MANY WEEKS 
IT IS BAD FOR EVERYONE MUST BE RESOLVED 
HE LOOKS LIKE HE NEEDS TO BE PUT 
OUT OF HIS MISERY HE SHOULD STILL 
BE THE MANAGER HE HAS DONE VERY 
GOOD JOB HE HAS BOUGHT A LOT OF 
PLAYERS IN THE YOUTH TEAM HAVE WON 
THE YOUTH CUP SO THERE IS MORE TO 
COME BUT ONCE THE OWNER SAYS HE 
WILL REVIEW WHICH IT IS LIGHT 
HOLD ON WHAT NEEDS REVIEWING 
HOPEFULLY HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THE 
PHONE CALL BY TONIGHT AND IN ALL 
HONESTY HE IS BETTER OFF OUT OF IT 
IF THAT IS HOW HE IS COMING TO RUN 
THE FOOTBALL CLUB 
AS FOR 
MIDDLESBROUGH THEY HAVE NOT SCORED 
MORE THAN TWO ALL SEASON SOME SOME OUTSTANDING GOALS AS WELL MOST IS 
THE GARETH SOUTHGATE SAY THAT ABOUT 
MANCHESTER CITY NICE TO SEE 
GARETH SOUTHGATE SAY THAT 
THE LAST 
TEAM TO SCORE EIGHT IN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE NEWCASTLE AND ALAN SHEARER 
GOT FIVE A TIME NOW FOR THE RESULT 
OF THE APRIL GOAL OF THE MONTH 
COMPETITION THE WINNING GOAL WAS 
SCORED BY STILIAN PETROV THREE TO ZERO A TREMENDOUS FINISH GREAT QUALITY THE ERROR FROM ROY CARROLL IT REALLY IS A MISERABLE AFTERNOON 
HE HAS CHOSEN TO SEE AN ASTON VILLA 
MATCH THREE GAMES LEFT TO SHOW DO 
SHORTLY SUNDERLAND AGAINST ARSENAL 
AND SPURS AGAINST LIVERPOOL BUT 
NEXT IT IS WEST HAM AGAINST ASTON 
VILLA BECAUSE OF RESULTS ELSEWHERE 
WE KNOW VILLA COULD NO LONGER GAIN 
A UEFA CUP SPOT BUT THERE WERE NOW 
GUARANTEED A PLACE IN THE INTERTOTO 
CUP ANTON FERDINAND RETURNS FROM INJURY 
AND THERE IS ALSO A RECALL FOR 
NOBBY SOLANO AFTER SEVEN YEARS'S 
SERVICE OLOF MELLBERG MAKES HIS 
FINAL APPEARANCE OF THE CLUB TO 
MARK THE OCCASION HE HAS BOUGHT 
SHIRTS FOR ALL THREE THOUSAND OF THE 
TRAVELLING VILLA FANS THAT HAVE 
MADE THE JOURNEY TO THE EAST END ASHLEY YOUNG FORCES THE CORNER 
FROM ONE END OF THE PITCH TO THE 
OTHER HE SHOT CRASHING AGAINST THE 
FAR POST AGAINST HIS FORMER CLUB THAT IS 
WHY THERE IS NO CELEBRATION FROM 
NOBBY SOLANO SCOTT CARSON COULD 
ONLY HELP IT ON ITS WAY IT MIGHT 
HAVE JUST CLIPPED THE BALL ON ITS 
WAY THROUGH AT THE WALL WHAT A BEAUTIFUL GOAL DIDN'T HE 
TAKE THAT WELL ASHLEY UN HE 
PASSED IT IN TO THE FAR POST 
ASHLEY YOUNG ASHLEY YOUNG FOUR GOALS IN THE LAST FOUR GAMES FOR ASHLEY YOUNG HERE IS THE MOMENT IS SILENT 
SILENCE THE WEST HAM FANS IT IS 
THE CAPTAIN THE MAN WHO MIGHT 
BELIEVING IN THE SUMMER BUT SCORED 
THAT GOAL HE STARTED IT HE SAW 
REO COKER IN SPACE HIS SHOT WAS 
BLOCKED BRILLIANTLY BY GREEN BARRY 
VOLLEY IS IT HOME VOLLEY IS IT 
HOME A GOOD RESPONSE BY WEST HAM THOUGH 
MORTE DID EVER SO WELL HERE A 
PERSISTENT QUALITY CROSS THE 
HEADER CRASHES AGAINST THE BAR PANTSIL WHAT A GOAL BY DEAN 
ASHTON THAT IS A TERRIFIC STRIKE 
BY DEAN ASHTON AND THAT WILL SEND 
THE HOME FANS HAPPY FOR THE SUMMER 
HE FIRED IT AWAY FROM KNIGHT AND 
INTO THE BACK OF THE NET 
I THINK THE TEAM WERE BRILLIANT AS 
THEY HAVE BEEN FOR MOST OF THE 
SEASON ONCE OR TWICE WE HAVE COME 
UP SHORT BUT HERE FROM THE SQUAD 
THAT WE POSSESS HERE I COULDN'T BE 
MORE PLEASED WITH THEM 
WE COULD DO 
BETTER NEXT YEAR TOP TEN FINISHES 
IT WAS A TERRIFIC RESULT FOR US 
NEXT YEAR WE ARE LOOKING FOR 
BETTER 
I THINK THE FUTURE IS BETTER BRIGHT WE HAVE A 
TALENTED PLAYERS 
WHO 
HAVE BEEN 
OUR 
KEY PLAYERS THIS 
SEASON AS 
KEY PLAYERS THIS SEASON AS I SAID I THINK THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT BERBATOV HE HAS ATTRACTED THE INTEREST OF EUROPEAN TOP CLUBS WELL IS IT GOING TO BE A CORNER A 
CHANCE FOR TOTTENHAM TO EXERT SOME 
PRESSURE THEY HAVE NOT DONE MUCH 
OF THAT IN THE FIRST HALF BERBATOV 
WITH THE HEADER THAT IS THE 
CLOSEST TOTTENHAM HAVE COME HERE IS GERRARD TORRES WITH A 
CHANCE IT HIT OF THE OF THE 
GOALKEEPER AND CAME OUT DID HE 
KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT HE HAD 
GONE DOWN TO HIS RIGHT HE CAME OFF THE DEFENDER BEFORE 
RAIN AND NEEDED TO GET IN TOUCH IT 
DEFLECTED OFF THE SIDE NETTING 
REINA VORONIN SURELY HE MUST AND HE HAS 
AND LIVERPOOL TAKE THE LEAD THERE 
WAS A LITTLE FLICK ON OF THE TOP OF 
THE HEAD OF FERNANDO TORRES AND 
VORONIN GO HAD GOT INSIDE THE 
DEFENDER HAD GOT INSIDE IT IS 
THE GOAL WHICH LIVERPOOL HAVE 
THREATENED RIGHT FROM THE START 
BUT IT HAD BEEN LONG TIME IN COMING DIDN'T HE GET THATAWAY WONDERFULLY 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC THAT AWAY 
A DIFFICULT BALL TO DEAL WITH AN 
AWKWARD HEIGHT WHAT A TOP DRAWER 
SAVE 
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE THAT IS SHIA QUALITY HE ROASTED A 
CENTRAL DEFENDER THAT IS PURE 
QUALITY HE SLIPPED IT UNDERNEATH 
THAT FOR LIVERPOOL'S SECOND GOAL THAT WAS A FINE SAVE TO PREVENT AN OWN GOAL 
IT IS OFF THE TOP OF THE CROSSBAR IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE JUST THE 
TO FOR LIVERPOOL AND THEY RICHLY 
DESERVE IT THEY END THE SEASON 
WITH THEIR BEST EVER GOALS 
DIFFERENCE WHICH IS NOW PLUS THIRTY NINE 
YOU WANT TO BUILD ON THE GOOD 
THINGS YOU HAVE GOT WILL THAT 
INCLUDE THE BATTLE 
BERBATOV 
HOPEFULLY LIKE THE MANAGER SAID 
LAST BECOME IT IS NOT IN HIS HANDS 
IT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN ON 
NOT HE IS UNDER CONTRACT AT THE 
MOMENT HE IS HERE WE ENJOY HIM 
IF HE DECIDES TO GO FOR THE CLUB 
DOES THE RIGHT OFFER WE WILL SEE 
OR THE CLUB DOES THE RIGHT OFFER ALL CHANGE FALL SUNDERLAND 
EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR STARTS FOR 
ARSENAL HE SAYS REPORTS THAT HE 
WANTS TO LEAVE ARE IN HIS WORDS 
RUBBISH SUNDERLAND'S FIRST SEASON 
BACK IN THE BICKLEY HAS BEEN 
SUCCESS BIG LEAGUE AN EARLY 
SAVE SMART SAVE TOO HERE IS NICHOLAS BENDTNER INTO 
ADEBAYOR AND FOR LOAM AND THAT 
IS SAVED WELL A SEASON OF WHY IT 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN FASTENED FINGER 
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOR ARSENE 
WENGER HE SCORES WITH STYLE A NICE COOL 
FINISH AVERILL GOALSCORER REAL O'DONOVAN SHOULD HAVE DONE MUCH 
MUCH BETTER THAT HAD TIME 
AND ROOM AND SPACE BUT NOT THE 
FINISH FROM O'DONOVAN THE REFEREE HAD A GOOD VIEW AND HE 
SAYS NO THERE WAS SOME CONTACT 
WASN'T THERE IT IS NOT A DEBUT GOAL WAS HE OFFSIDE IS HE JUST OFFSIDE IT WAS MIGHTY CLOSE O'DONOVAN FABIANSKI SAVES IT THEY 
HAVE HAD THEIR MOMENTS TODAY 
SUNDERLAND THEY JUST HAVE NOT 
TAKEN THEM 
TO GET OVER A TWO POINTS YOU NEED 
TO HAVE A SPECIAL TEAM AND WE HAVE 
FULFILLED THE EXPECTATION BUT WE 
ARE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THERE WAS 
VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 
TOP THREE EIGHTY TWO POINTS 
THEY HAVE 
BEEN SOME MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENTS AND 
PLENTY OF DEFEATS BUT WE HAVE 
MANAGED TO STAY IN THE PREMIERSHIP 
AND 
WE NEED 
TO LEARN 
FROM MISTAKES

MADE THIS 
YEAR AND
