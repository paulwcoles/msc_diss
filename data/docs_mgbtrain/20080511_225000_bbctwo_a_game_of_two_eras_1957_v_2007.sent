THE FIRST F. A. CUP FINAL AT THE NEW WEMBLEY STADIUM WAS AN EAGERLY AWAITED CONTEST 
BETWEEN CHELSEA AND MANCHESTER UNITED 
BUT WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED FOOTBALL MATCHES A SEASON NOW SCREENED LIVE CLASHES BETWEEN TOP TEAMS 
ARE A VERY FAMILIAR SIGHT AND THE GAME A TACTICAL STALEMATE 
HAD LITTLE OF THE TRADITIONAL MAGIC OF THE F. A. CUP 
FIFTY YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN THE WEMBLEY FINAL BETWEEN MANCHESTER UNITED AND ASTON VILLA WAS ONE OF ONLY 
TWO MATCHES TO BE SCREENED LIVE ALL SEASON AND THE GAME WAS A FAR MORE DRAMATIC AND CONTROVERSIAL EVENT 
THE F. A. CUP FINAL WAS THE GAME OF THE SEASON 
CHARLTON 
IT WOULD BECOME INFAMOUS FOR A SHOCKING CHALLENGE ON UNITED GOALKEEPER RAY WOOD 
THAT SORT OF CHALLENGE NOW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FIRST THE GAME WOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED 
HE WOULD'VE BEEN SENT OFF ABSOLUTELY HECKLED ALL THE WAY OFF THE PITCH 
IT WAS A FAIR CHARGE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEIR HEADS COLLIDED 
BUT IT WAS ALSO A GAME OF POWERFUL GOALSCORING 
MCPARLAND A GOAL BY MCPARLAND 
THE CUP WINNING HEROES THAT DAY WERE PLAYERS FROM ANOTHER FOOTBALL ERA 
DUGDALE WITH THE FREEKICK 
BUT HOW DO THEY COMPARE WITH TODAY'S BREED OF SUPERSTAR FOOTBALLERS 
HOW DID THEY PASS THE BALL 
WERE THEY AS SKILFUL 
HOW HARD DID THEY TACKLE 
THE ART OF TACKLING FROM SOME OF THESE BOYS THEN WAS GREAT 
THEY MADE GREAT TACKLES FROM THE BACK AND TOOK THE BALL OFF YOU 
TO FIND OUT HOW ENGLISH FOOTBALL HAS REALLY CHANGED THIS FILM CONDUCTS 
A UNIQUE EXPERIMENT USING THE LATEST FOOTBALL TECHNOLOGY 
TO COMPARE EVERY ASPECT OF THESE TWO CUP FINALS SEPARATED BY FIFTY YEARS 
JOIN US FOR A GAME OF TWO ERAS 
ON MAY FOURTH NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FANS FLOCKED DOWN WEMBLEY WAY 
TO STAND TOGETHER ON THE FAMOUS TERRACES 
IT WAS THE SPORTING EVENT OF THE YEAR 
THERE WAS A SPECIAL SORT OF EXPECTANCY IN THOSE DAYS 
THEY DID NOT SEE THESE GREAT PLAYERS VERY OFTEN 
THEY WERE CRAMMED IN TOGETHER AND THERE WAS A NICE ATMOSPHERE ABOUT IT 
IT WAS THE GAME THAT NOT ONLY EVERYBODY WENT TO WEMBLEY 
OF THE TWO SIDES 
BUT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY COULD SEE IF YOU'D GOT A TELEVISION 
YES BLACK AND WHITE BUT IF YOU'D GOT A TELEVISION YOU WERE IN BUSINESS 
BECAUSE NOT ONLY COULD YOU WATCH IT YOURSELF 
BUT ALL THOSE NEIGHBOURS IN YOUR STREET WHO DID NOT HAVE A TELEVISION CAME TO YOUR HOUSE TO WATCH IT 
THE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN CUP FINAL WAS NEVER GOING TO BE JUST ANOTHER GAME 
FOR THE PLAYERS LIKE THE FANS WHO STOOD ON THE WEMBLEY TERRACES IT WAS THE GAME OF THEIR LIVES 
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
YOU'RE IN THE DRESSING ROOM AND ALL OF A SUDDEN 
SOMEONE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR AND SAYS THEY'RE SINGING ABIDE WITH ME 
GET UP TO THE END OF THE TUNNEL 
ABIDE WITH ME 
AND THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A FEELING THERE THIS IS IT 
TUMMY NERVES COME INTO IT 
A FEW PLAYERS ARE CHARGING OUT TO GO TO THE TOILET 
A FELLOW WHO PLAYED IN THE F. A. CUP FINAL 
JIMMY DUGDALE OUR CENTRE HALF WAS ACTUALLY SICK IN THE DRESSING ROOM 
THE BEGINNING BEFORE THE START 
IT'S VERY VERY EXCITING 
ABSOLUTELY EXCITING 
THE SINGING OF ABIDE WITH ME HAS BEEN PART OF CUP FINAL TRADITION SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN 
A TICKET IN FIFTY SEVEN COST TEN AND SIX ABOUT EIGHT IN TODAY'S MONEY 
FIFTY YEARS ON ABIDE WITH ME ABIDES 
BUT TICKETS AT UP TO NINETY A SEAT CERTAINLY ARE NOT GOING FOR A SONG 
DON'T FORGET IN FIFTY SEVEN THEY WERE STANDING UP ALL OF THEM 
AND YOU HAVE GOT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE 
YOU JUST HAVE A LOOK AROUND QUICK AND YOU KNOW THAT IS IT 
JUST CONCENTRATE DON'T FALL ON YOUR FACE 
ASTON VILLA HAD WON THE CUP SIX TIMES BEFORE BUT DESPITE FEATURING INTERNATIONALS LIKE 
JACKIE SEWELL AND PETER MCPARLAND THEY WERE CONSIDERED THE UNDERDOGS 
UNDER MANAGER MATT BUSBY MANCHESTER UNITED HAD ALREADY WON THE LEAGUE THAT SEASON AND WITH PROMISING 
YOUNGSTERS LIKE BOBBY CHARLTON AND DUNCAN EDWARDS THE BUSBY BABES WERE CLEAR FAVOURITES TO LIFT THE CUP 
THE FIRST REAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
IS THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE TEAMS 
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BOTH FINALISTS USED A FLEXIBLE FOUR THREE THREE FORMATION 
BY CONTRAST THE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN FINALISTS BOTH ADOPTED A CLASSIC THREE TWO FIVE LINE UP 
YOU PLAYED WITH TWO FULL BACKS AND THE CENTRE HALF WAS THE THIRD BACK 
WINGERS STAYED WIDE WING HALVES WERE THERE 
TO DO THE DONKEY WORK IN MIDFIELD PICKUP THE IMPOSING INSIDE FORWARDS 
SUPPORT THE WINGERS AND GENERALLY SUPPORT THE MEN UP FRONT 
INSIDE FORWARDS WERE THERE TO CREATE OPEN UP SPACE ON THE WINGS 
WHO WOULD THEN PROVIDE THE CROSSES FOR THE CENTRE FORWARD 
CENTRE FORWARDS WERE THERE TO HOLD THE LINE CERTAINLY 
THEY WERE USUALLY GOOD IN THE AIR 
JUST A HUBBUB OF CONVERSATION AT THE MOMENT 
ANY SECOND NOW IT WILL EXPLODE INTO AN EAR SPLITTING ROAR 
MANCHESTER UNITED TO KICK OFF 
THERE WAS A GREAT MOMENT WHEN KENNETH WOLSTENHOLME SAYS 
THE PLAYERS ARE LIMBERING UP ON THE PITCH 
AND THEY ARE WAITING FOR THE SIGNAL FOR THE MATCH TO BEGIN TO BE GIVEN FROM THE ROYAL BOX 
WAITING FOR THE SIGNAL FROM THE ROYAL BOX 
AND YOU'RE JUST THINKING HERE AM I SORT OF WATCHING FOOTBALL IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
AND THE GAME STARTS WHEN THE TELEVISION PRODUCER WAVES A FINGER FROM THE HALFWAY LINE 
AND THE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN FINAL STARTS WITH MANCHESTER UNITED IN THE WHITE SHIRTS 
IN FOOTBALL TERMS THE POWER HAS MOVED AWAY FROM THE ROYAL BOX AND INTO THE TELEVISION STUDIO 
TELEVISION COVERAGE OF FOOTBALL IN THE MODERN ERA DOES MORE THAN SIMPLY BROADCAST THE MATCH 
DOZENS OF CAMERAS CAPTURE EVERY MOVE AND THESE PICTURES ARE USED 
TO ANALYSE THE WAY THE GAME IS PLAYED AND HOW THE PLAYERS PERFORM 
DELTA TRE ARE A FOOTBALL STATISTICS COMPANY WHICH 
COLLECTS DATA ON EVERYTHING FROM TACKLES MADE TO PASSES COMPLETED 
STATS ON THE LEFT ARE THE RUNNING STATS AS THE MATCH PROGRESSES 
POSSESSION CORNER SHOTS FOULS 
THE GREEN TEXT IN THE MIDDLE IS ALL THE EVENTS AS THEY HAPPEN 
IT'S LOGGED BY OUR SPOTTERS UP IN THE GANTRY 
DELTA TRE ARE EMPLOYED BY F. I. F. A. AND UEFA TO ANALYSE THE PERFORMANCES OF 
TEAMS PLAYING IN THE WORLD CUP AND EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE 
FOR THIS FILM ONLY THEY WILL APPLY THEIR 
TECHNOLOGY TO THE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN F. A. CUP FINAL AND COMPARE IT TO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FINAL 
IT IS THE FIRST TIME THIS KIND OF COMPARISON HAS BEEN MADE 
THE FIRST FACT THESE STATISTICS UNCOVER IS THAT IT IS NOT UNTIL 
ALMOST THE FOURTH MINUTE OF THE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN FINAL FOR THE REFEREE AWARDS THE GAME'S FIRST FREE KICK 
THE FIRST FREE KICK OF THE MATCH A CHARGE IN THE BACK BY FOULKES 
HOWEVER IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BARELY FIFTY SECONDS ARE ON THE CLOCK WHEN THE FIRST FOUL IS COMMITTED 
THE BOUNDARIES OF ACCEPTABLE PHYSICAL CONTACT WERE MUCH LOOSER FIFTY YEARS AGO 
THIS TOLERATION OF A MORE PHYSICAL TYPE OF FOOTBALL 
WAS BRUTALLY ILLUSTRATED ONLY SIX MINUTES INTO THE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN FINAL 
A CLATTERING CHALLENGE LEFT THE UNITED PLAYER UNCONSCIOUS AND THE REFEREE WAVED PLAY ON 
THAT WAS A FAIR CHARGE 
UNFORTUNATELY THEIR HEADS HAVE COLLIDED 
BOTH MCPARLAND AND WOOD ARE OUT 
ON COME THE TWO TRAINERS RACING AT A TREMENDOUS RATE 
JACKIE SEWELL WAS IN THE INSIDE RIGHT POSITION ON THE CORNER OF THE PENALTY AREA 
TO SEWELL 
AND HE CLIPPED THE BALL IN FOR ME AND WHILE THE BALL WAS IN FLIGHT 
I HAD THE BALL IN THE BACK OF THE NET ON THE FAR POST I WAS GOING TO KNOCK IT STRAIGHT BACK INTO THE FAR POST 
MCPARLAND 
UNFORTUNATELY I WHACKED IT STRAIGHT INTO RAY WOOD WHO WAS COMING OFF HIS LINE 
RAY KEPT COMING TOWARDS ME AS I WAS FOLLOWING UP 
THAT WAS A FAIR CHARGE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEIR HEADS HAVE COLLIDED 
I PUT A SHOULDER CHARGE IN FOR HIM AND HE PULLED AWAY AT THE LAST MINUTE 
UNFORTUNATELY WE DID BANG THE SIDES OF OUR HEADS TOGETHER 
IT WAS A FAIR CHARGE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEIR HEADS HAVE COLLIDED 
AND BOTH MCPARLAND AND WOOD ARE OUT 
IT WAS JUST UNFORTUNATE IT HIT HIM ON THE TEMPLE I THINK 
I THINK YOU CAN SEE STARS A BIT WHEN IT CATCHES YOU LIKE THAT 
IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IN FOOTBALL 
A FAIR SHOULDER CHARGE THEN TWO HEADS COLLIDE 
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR HEAD HITS SOMEBODY ELSE'S 
THE MOST SHOCKING THING ABOUT THAT CHALLENGE IS THE FACT THAT 
THERE'S A GOOD FIVE OR SIX YARDS BETWEEN MCPARLAND AND WOOD 
AS WOOD COLLECTS THE BALL MCPARLAND CARRIES ON 
AND COLLIDES WITH HIM MAYBE HE'S TRYING TO IMPOSE HIS PRESENCE ON THE KEEPER 
SHAKE HIM UP A BIT BUT HE CARRIES ON THROUGH AND DISLOCATES HIS JAW 
DESCRIBED BY THE COMMENTARY TEAM AS AN ACCIDENT 
THE MATCH WAS OBVIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS AN ACCIDENT RIDDEN GAME 
WHEREAS TODAY'S GAMES IT DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST A YELLOW CARD 
WOOD CERTAINLY LOOKS VERY BADLY OFF 
HE MUST BE EXTREMELY BADLY DAZED 
HE MIGHT WELL HAVE TO GO OFF 
SHOULDER CHARGING WAS ALLOWED THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
THEREFORE WHEN HE WENT IN TO SHOULDER CHARGE RAY WOOD HE WAS IN ORDER AT THAT TIME 
HE WAS ALLOWED TO DO THAT 
THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS IN THOSE DAYS FOR THE GOALKEEPER 
HE WAS A SITTING TARGET FOR 
ANYBODY THAT WAS PREPARED TO TAKE THE CHANCE 
IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF SOMEONE IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO INTO GOAL 
YES RAY WOOD IS GOING OFF 
A STRETCHER HAS BEEN CALLED FOR 
I THINK BY AND LARGE THE REFEREES DECIDED TO PLAY THAT WAY 
VERY FEW FOULS WERE GIVEN AGAINST GOALKEEPERS PARTICULARLY 
WHEREAS NOW WE SEE THE KEEPER THAT YOU CAN'T GO NEAR HIM WITHOUT A FOUL BEING GIVEN 
IT WAS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT IN OUR DAY 
WHEN THE GOALKEEPER WAS LOOKED UPON AS ONE OF THE PLAYERS AS IT WERE 
ANY PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH GOALKEEPERS HAS BEEN OUTLAWED IN THE MODERN GAME 
THESE TOUGHER RULES HAVE ACTUALLY HELPED IMPROVE 
THE PERFORMANCE OF KEEPERS WHO THRIVE ON THIS GREATER PROTECTION 
GOALKEEPERS IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN WERE ALSO FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED 
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS HILARIOUS WAS KENNETH WOLSTENHOLME SAID SOME OF THE FANS ARE 
BEING A LITTLE BIT SILLY NOW THE MANCHESTER UNITED FANS ARE BOOING 
HOW CAN THEY BOO IT WAS A COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE CHALLENGE 
THESE TYPE OF THINGS GO ON ALL THE TIME 
I SAID WELL THEY MIGHT HAVE GONE ON ALL THE TIME IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN BUT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IT SIMPLY DOES NOT HAPPEN 
SO I THINK THE GAME HAS DEFINITELY BECAME LESS PHYSICAL 
RATHER SILLY BOOING FROM SOME OF THE MANCHESTER SPECTATORS EVERY TIME MCPARLAND GETS THE BALL 
A GOALKEEPER WOULD TAKE YOU ON 
SOMETIMES IN THE SHOULDER CHARGE I'VE BEEN HIT I WAS HIT BY A GOALKEEPER AT CHELSEA 
HE KNOCKED SEVEN BELLS OUT OF ME AND I HIT THE GROUND 
THEN I GOT ON MY FEET AGAIN BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT TO LET ON THAT HE HAD DONE A BIT OF DAMAGE TO ME 
I WAS A PIECE OF JELLY STANDING FOR A MOMENT OR TWO 
IN A CUP GAME REG MATTHEWS AN OLD ENGLAND GOALKEEPER AND HE CLEARED THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD 
AND HAD A LITTLE WHISPER AS HE WAS GOING PAST ME 
HE SAID COME BACK AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME MORE 
THE GOALKEEPERS TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF PRIDE IN THEMSELVES THAT 
IF YOU MADE A PROBLEM FOR THEM AND YOU CAME IN THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE SHOULDER CHARGING 
THEY WOULD GIVE YOU A BELT BACK YOU KNOW WITH THE SHOULDER 
IT WAS ALL PART OF THE GAME THEN 
HERE COMES THE STRETCHER FOR RAY WOOD 
THIS REALLY IS A TRAGEDY 
AFTER SIX MINUTES PLAY RAY WOOD CARRIED OFF ON A STRETCHER AFTER THAT COLLISION WITH MCPARLAND 
KEEPERS LIKE RAY WOOD COULD NOT RELY ON THE EXPERT MEDICAL ASSISTANCE 
WAITING ON THE SIDELINES LIKE IN THE MODERN GAME 
NO DISRESPECT TO ANYBODY YOU SAW HOW RAY WOOD WAS TREATED 
THAT FELLOW WAS KNOCKED OUT AND YOU SEE HOW THEY PICK HIS NECK 
THEY GET IN AROUND HIS NECK AND PICK HIM UP THERE GOODNESS ME 
GOODNESS ME THAT WOULD NEVER NEVER HAPPEN NOW 
SO THERE HAVE BEEN PLAYERS THAT YOU GO BACK TO THE FIFTIES 
THAT LOST A CAREER BECAUSE AT THAT TIME THE MEDICAL EXPERTISE SIMPLY WAS NOT THERE 
HE'S CLEARLY UNCONSCIOUS 
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'S GOT A HEAD INJURY A NECK INJURY A BACK INJURY OR AN ARM INJURY 
AND THE TRAINER COMES ON WITH A NOT SO MAGICAL SPONGE AT ALL 
THE TRAINER COMES ON AND SORT OF POTTERS ABOUT CLEARLY HAS NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON 
AND THEN WHEN IT COMES OBVIOUS THAT WOOD ISN'T GOING TO CONTINUE IN GOAL 
EVERYBODY'S REACTION IS TO TRY TO PULL THIS MAN'S GOALKEEPING JERSEY OFF 
ONE IT BEGS THE QUESTION AS TO WHY EVEN THEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE A SPARE GOALKEEPING JERSEY 
CLEARLY THE KIT MAN'S SLIGHTLY REMISS THERE IF THERE WAS ONE 
AND YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED LOOK AT HIM 
WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO PULL UP HIS ARMS IF HIS ARM IS BROKEN 
WHICH PERHAPS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE BEST SCENARIO 
THEN IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN MORE BROKEN ONCE THEY'VE ROUGHLY MANHANDLED THIS JERSEY OFF HIM 
IF HE'S GOT A HEAD BACK OR NECK INJURY IT COULD PERMANENTLY DISABLE THIS POOR MAN FOR LIFE 
ONLY A YEAR EARLIER IN THE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX CUP FINAL MANCHESTER CITY GOALKEEPER BERT TRAUTMAN 
BROKE HIS NECK IN A CHALLENGE 
TRAUTMAN'S DOWN HE'S INJURED 
TEAM MATES HELP TRAUTMAN TO HIS FEET 
HE TELLS THE TRAINER HE'S ALL RIGHT BUT THE CROWD CAN SEE HIS NECK IS HURTING BADLY 
OVER DAVE EWING'S HEAD AND TRAUTMAN'S GAME IS OVER 
INJURED OR NOT HE'S DETERMINED TO PULL HIS WEIGHT 
NOWADAYS IF A PLAYER FALLS THERE'S IMMEDIATELY SOMEONE SPRINTING OUT 
YOU KNOW THE PHYSIOS ARE AS QUICK NOW AS SOME OF THE PLAYERS WERE 
CHECKING THAT HE HASN'T SWALLOWED HIS TONGUE 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN YOU KNOW THE REMEDY FOR CONCUSSION 
WAS TO HAVE YOUR FACE WASHED AND A WEE SLAP OF THE FACE 
IT WAS DIFFERENT ALTOGETHER THAN IT IS TODAY WHERE THE PEOPLE THAT GO ON 
THE FIELD OF PLAY OR IF THE PLAYER IS CARRIED OFF 
THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY HAVE THE FIRST CLASS TREATMENT 
ALTHOUGH TOM FINNEY DIDN'T PLAY IN THE FIFTY SEVEN CUP FINAL HE WAS VOTED 
PLAYER OF THE YEAR THAT SEASON AND TODAY ALL PROFESSIONAL CLUBS LIKE 
FINNEY'S FORMER SIDE PRESTON NORTH END EMPLOY A FULL TIME MEDICAL TEAM LED BY THEIR OWN DOCTOR 
THE STAFF INCLUDE A PHYSIOTHERAPIST WHO HELPS REHABILITATE INJURED PLAYERS AT THEIR TRAINING GROUND 
IT'S THE BACKBONE OF THE CLUB 
PLAYERS ARE ALWAYS GETTING INJURED TRYING TO KEEP FIT MAINTAIN FITNESS 
WHEREAS IT USED TO BE A REACTIVE PROCESS NOW IT'S A PROACTIVE PROCESS 
WE'RE ALWAYS TREATING THINGS AND TRYING TO STOP THINGS HAPPEN 
SO THE MAGIC SPONGE HAS GONE 
NOW WE'RE TRYING TO STOP INJURIES HAPPENING 
PREVENTATIVE REHABILITATION IS THE KEY 
THAT DIP THERE SEE WHERE THERE'S LIKE A LITTLE HOLE IN THE MIDDLE 
THAT'S YOUR JOIN AND YOUR MEDIAL LIGAMENTS ON TOP THERE 
IT'S INTACT 
JOE HAS DAMAGED HIS CARTILAGE AND IN THE OLD DAYS THEY'D HAVE JUST TAKEN THE CARTILAGE OUT 
AND LEFT THE BONE ON BONE SURFACES AND WEAR AND TEAR THE BONE THEY'D GET ARTHRITIS 
NOW JOE'S HAD IT REPAIRED SO IT'S GONNA LENGTHEN HIS CAREER AND HOPEFULLY 
HAVE LESS PROBLEMS THAN WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD IN THE PAST 
IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW 
SCIENCE AND SPORTS MEDICINE HAS IMPROVED AND IT'S LENGTHENED PLAYERS' CAREERS NOW 
WE'VE GOT THE SPRINT TEST PAUL YOU RUN YOU WALK YOU LOOP AROUND AND THEN YOU RUN AGAIN 
SO IT'S LIKE THE BLEEP 
PLAYERS ARE ALSO PROTECTED FROM INJURIES BECAUSE THE TACKLE FROM BEHIND HAS BEEN BANNED 
SO IF YOU TOUCH THE OPPOSITION PLAYER EVEN IF YOU ACTUALLY WIN THE BALL A FREE KICK IS GIVEN 
THIS CONTACT WAS ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
AND ROBUST CHALLENGES WERE SEEN AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE GAME 
THE ART OF TACKLING FROM SOME OF THESE BOYS THEN WAS GREAT 
THEY MADE GREAT TACKLES FROM THE BACK AND TOOK THE BALL OFF YOU 
AND THEY MADE GREAT TACKLES FROM THE BACK AND KNOCKED IT AWAY FROM YOU 
AND THIS EXCELLENT SORT OF 
FOOTAGE IN THE CUP FINAL WHERE FELLAS HAVE DONE THAT ON BOTH SIDES 
ROGER BYRNE BILL FOULKES AND STAN AND PETER ALDIS AND JIMMY DUGDALE THEY DID ALL THOSE THINGS 
AND THE REFEREE WAS ON THE SPOT WATCHING IT AND THE FELLAS PLAYED THE BALL AND THEY GOT 
THE REFEREE DIDN'T PUNISH THEM IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM 
WAVES PLAY ON BECAUSE BERRY HAS GOT POSSESSION 
IT'S DUGDALE WHO COMES ACROSS TO CUT OFF THE DANGER 
I USED TO WAIT UNTIL HE PULLED HIS FOOT BACK 
AND THEN WHEN HE STARTED TO GO FORWARD I USED TO PUT MY FOOT THERE ON THE BALL 
AND THAT WOULD STOP HIM 
I'D GET THE BALL AND RUN AWAY 
FOULS DO SEEM TO BE GIVEN FOR THE MORE RUGGED CHALLENGES WHEREAS IN THE FIFTY SEVEN FINAL THEY SEEMED TO 
THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE GAME IS MORE ACCEPTED THAN THIS IS 
THEY WANT TO ENCOURAGE FLAIR AND SKILLED PLAYERS 
LIKE RONALDO AND GIGGS SO THEY CLAMP DOWN ON HEAVIER CHALLENGES 
THAT'S MCPARLAND 
HE'S FLAT OUT 
HE SEEMED TO CATCH THE ELBOW OF FOULKES IN HIS FACE 
THAT'S HOW I SAW IT WALLY DID YOU 
WITH ONLY FOURTEEN MINUTES ON THE CLOCK 
UNITED TOOK SOME RETRIBUTION ON MCPARLAND FOR HIS CHALLENGE ON WOOD 
THIS HAS SO FAR BEEN A REAL BAD TEMPERED MATCH 
LET'S HOPE IT DOESN'T CONTINUE 
IT WASN'T JUST THE LEVEL OF PHYSICAL CONTACT THAT VARIED 
THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHY OF HOW FOOTBALL SHOULD BE PLAYED WAS RADICALLY DIFFERENT 
THE GAME WAS KEPT SIMPLE AND ENGLISH TEAMS PLAYED AN UNCOMPLICATED AND DIRECT LONG BALL GAME 
ANY TIME I GOT THE BALL I LOOKED FOR THE CENTRE FORWARD AND THE TWO WINGERS 
WE WANTED TO GET INTO THE OPPOSITION PENALTY AREA AS EARLY AND AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE 
WE PLAYED A LOT OFF THE CUFF 
PEOPLE KNEW WHAT TO DO KNEW HOW TO PLAY AND THE MANAGERS KNEW HOW TO 
GET PEOPLE GOING BUT THEY DIDN'T BAMBOOZLE US WITH TACTICS 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN THE FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO GIVE THE BALL TO THE TWO WINGERS 
TO PUT CROSSES IN FOR THE CENTRE FORWARD 
WHEN PEGG AND BERRY GOT THE BALL INVARIABLY THEY RAN AT THE FULL BACK 
THEY WEREN'T ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL 
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANY MOANS FROM THE CROWD WHEN THEY LOST THE BALL 
COS THEY WERE DOING WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF THEM 
THAT'S WINGERS DO THEY ATTACK THEIR FULL BACKS AND TRY TO BEAT THEM THEY DON'T BEAT THEM ALL OF THE TIME 
COLMAN 
BERRY 
THE GAME'S SURPRISINGLY QUICK 
MAINLY THAT'S BECAUSE THE BALL'S PINGING AROUND 
THERE'S NO DESIRE TO HAVE ANY BUILD UP PLAY 
THE BALL DOES GO END TO END AND IT GETS QUITE SCRAPPY IN MIDFIELD 
SO THE MIDFIELDERS DO GET THROUGH QUITE A LOT OF WORK 
AND THE GAME'S ACTUALLY VERY FAST AND VERY PHYSICAL 
SMITH 
NOW THE EMPHASIS HAS GROWN PROGRESSIVELY 
PARTICULARLY DURING THE NINETIES AND THE INFLUENCE OF 
SOME OUTSTANDING FOREIGN PLAYERS IN OUR FOOTBALL POSSESSION IS SORT OF 
TEN ELEVEN TENTHS OF THE LAW NOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU DO GIVE 
THE BALL AWAY IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE O. THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET IT BACK FOR A LONG TIME 
IN THIS GAME YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A CASUALNESS ABOUT POSSESSION 
IF SOMETHING WAS ON YOU'D PASS YOUR WAY THROUGH AND CREATE A SCORING CHANCE 
IF NOTHING MUCH WAS ON YOU DIDN'T HOLD IT 
THEY DIDN'T HOLD IT AT THE BACK THEY DIDN'T PLAY THE BALL AROUND 
THERE WAS NOT THE PATIENCE PERHAPS THAT WE SEE NOW 
AND THERE WAS A TENDENCY OF SOME PLAYERS EVEN MANCHESTER UNITED TO 
OH WELL WE'LL LUMP THE BALL UPFIELD AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
NOW THAT'S ABOUT THE LAST THING MANCHESTER UNITED WOULD DO 
EVERYONE THINKS OF THE PAST AS BEING A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY WHERE EVERYONE PLAYED FANTASTIC FOOTBALL 
AND IT WAS LOVELY INTRICATE PASSING AND WINGERS WERE JUST SORT OF YOU KNOW 
TOYING WITH FULL BACKS AND IT WAS MAGNIFICENT ALL OVER THE PLACE 
I THINK THAT'S POSSIBLY BECAUSE ENGLISH TEAMS HAVE BECOME MORE EXPOSED TO EUROPEAN FOOTBALL 
ENGLISH FOOTBALL IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN WAS STILL LARGELY ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD 
WITH ENGLISH CLUBS STILL NOT COMPETING REGULARLY IN EUROPE 
THE DIRECT TACTICS OF THEIR GAME HAD REMAINED LARGELY UNQUESTIONED 
NOT ONLY WERE THERE NO FOREIGN FOOTBALLERS PLAYING IN ENGLAND 
TEAMS WERE MOSTLY MADE UP OF PLAYERS FROM THE SAME LOCAL COMMUNITY 
IT WAS MY AMBITION AND I THINK IT WAS EVERYBODY'S AMBITION 
CERTAINLY MOST PLAYERS TO PLAY FOR THEIR HOME CLUBS 
THAT'S THE FIRST GOAL BY TOM FINNEY 
THE WAY TO SUM UP THE GAME IS THAT IT WAS 
OF THE WORKING CLASS BY THE WORKING CLASS FOR THE WORKING CLASS 
BUT THE ONE THING IT WASN'T WAS A GOLDEN PASSPORT OUT OF THE WORKING CLASS 
I THINK ALSO WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT IN THE LATE FIFTIES 
THE PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLERS USUALLY CAME FROM THE TOWNS AND THE AREAS THAT THEY LIVED IN 
THE LOCAL BOYS CAME INTO THEIR TEAMS AND THEY LIVED LOCALLY 
AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE CARS IN THE MAIN AND THEY GOT THE TRANSPORT 
AND THE SUPPORTER SAT WITH HIM PROBABLY ON THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
ON THE BUS AND THEN WATCHED HIM PLAY ON THE SATURDAY 
PLAYERS IN FIFTY SEVEN HAD TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR FUTURES AFTER FOOTBALL 
THIS WAS STILL THE ERA OF THE MAXIMUM WAGE WHICH INCREDIBLY 
LIMITED ALL PLAYERS' WAGES TO FIFTEEN A WEEK DURING THE SEASON AND ONLY THIRTEEN IN THE SUMMER 
THIS TOP WAGE WAS EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY A WEEK 
BUT ONLY ONE IN FIVE FOOTBALLERS ACTUALLY RECEIVED IT 
THEY MIGHT BE EARNING SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THE SPECTATORS THEY MIGHT BE EARNING SLIGHTLY LESS 
BUT THEY WEREN'T SET APART FROM THEM IN THE WAY THAT PLAYERS ARE NOW YOU KNOW LIVING IN SECURE ESTATES 
ESSENTIALLY ON A DIFFERENT PLANET 
UNLIKE THE STAR PLAYERS OF TODAY EVEN ENGLAND INTERNATIONALS LIKE TOM FINNEY 
HAD TO PLAN FOR A LIFE AFTER FOOTBALL 
SKILLED HANDS GO WITH THE NIMBLE FEET OF PRESTON AND ENGLAND WINGER TOM FINNEY 
HIS FUTURE ASSURED IN AN ENGINEERING BUSINESS WHICH HE SHARES WITH HIS BROTHER 
WHILST HE WAS THE GREATEST FOOTBALLER IN THE COUNTRY 
TOM FINNEY WAS ALSO BUILDING UP HIS PLUMBING BUSINESS 
AND ONCE TOM FINNEY RETIRED THAT'S WHAT HE DID 
HE BECAME A PLUMBER 
I MEAN OF COURSE THERE'S THE CLASSICAL ILLUSTRATIVE STORY 
THE SECRETARY OF THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE ALAN HARDACRE 
PHONING UP FOR A PLUMBER AND ENGLAND'S OUTSIDE RIGHT 
TURNING UP ON HIS DOORSTEP IN HIS OVERALLS WITH HIS TOOL BAG TOM FINNEY 
AND THIS WASN'T SEEN AS ECCENTRIC IT WAS SEEN AS PREPARING FOR LIFE AFTER FOOTBALL 
IT WAS SEEN AS VERY VERY WISE VERY CRAFTY 
IT WOULD GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO DO IN THE SUMMER 
BECAUSE FOOTBALLERS' WAGES WENT DOWN WHEN THEY WEREN'T PLAYING 
AND THIS WAS A CONCERN FOR ALL FOOTBALLERS IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
RALPH COLLINS IS A STEEL WORKER DURING THE WEEK AND A CAPTAIN AND RIGHT BACK ON SATURDAYS 
WILL HARVEY THE INSIDE RIGHT IS ANOTHER PART TIMER 
HE PACKS SWEETS FOR A LIVING 
A SAFETY ENGINEER AND KILMARNOCK'S RIGHT HALF IS JOHNNY RUSSELL 
JIMMY BROWN ON THE LEFT AND BOB TYNE BOTH HAVE JOBS IN THE MOTOR TRADE 
WITH TWENTY FIVE MINUTES GONE THE TEN MEN OF MANCHESTER UNITED ARE STILL 
HOLDING ON WITH CENTRE HALF JACKIE BLANCHFLOWER IN GOAL 
THE MANCHESTER UNITED FANS ARE STARTING THIS TREMENDOUS ROAR 
THEY'VE SEEN THEIR TEAM'S LASTED OUT FOR TWENTY FIVE MINUTES 
NOT GIVEN A GOAL AWAY DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF A GOALKEEPER 
SO THEY'RE BEGINNING TO FEEL VERY CONFIDENT AND WELL THEY MIGHT BE TOO 
NOW HERE'S DIXON 
MCPARLAND 
EDWARDS THERE NOW TO CHARLTON 
THE TACTICALLY LIMITED NATURE OF THE ENGLISH GAME MEANT IT 
WAS RELATIVELY EASY FOR TEAMS TO CANCEL OUT AN EXTRA MAN ADVANTAGE 
NOT THAT THESE LIMITATIONS WERE APPARENT TO THOSE WHO RAN THE GAME 
ENGLAND THOUGHT 
THAT IT WAS NATURALLY THE BEST COUNTRY AT FOOTBALL 
BUT IN FACT THE F. A.'S DELIBERATE POLICY OF ISOLATION 
MEANT THAT IT HAD GROWN UP AS SORT OF THE VILLAGE IDIOT OF WORLD FOOTBALL 
IT DIDN'T REALISE HOW MUCH WORLD FOOTBALL HAD PASSED THE ENGLISH GAME BY 
YET THE WORLD OF ENGLISH FOOTBALL HAD ONLY RECENTLY BEEN ROCKED WHEN 
HUNGARY BECAME THE FIRST FOREIGN TEAM TO BEAT ENGLAND AT WEMBLEY 
THE TECHNICALLY GIFTED HUNGARIANS EXPOSED THE LACK OF SKILL IN THE NATIONAL SIDE 
THERE IS NUMBER FIVE BUT HE'S NOT THE CENTRE HALF 
NOW A CHANCE FOR HIDEGKUTI IT'S A GOAL 
THEY SEEM TO OPEN UP A DEFENCE WITH A GOOD SHIMMY 
A SHAKE OF THE HIPS AND THE DEFENCE JUST OPENS WIDE AND THEY CAN COME THROUGH 
CZIBOR COMING IN THE OUTSIDE LEFT 
BACK TO PUSKAS 
IT'S A GOAL 
WITH THE OUTSIDE LEFT CZIBOR RIGHT OVER ON THE RIGHT WING 
A LOVELY GOAL 
TWENTY FOUR MINUTES HUNGARY THREE ENGLAND ONE 
IT'S A GOAL 
WATCH IT IT'S A GOAL 
SO AFTER FIFTY TWO MINUTES ENGLAND TWO HUNGARY FIVE 
PUSKAS 
HIDEGKUTI IT'S A GOAL 
THAT SORT OF FOOTBALL WAS ALMOST LIKE A SORT OF WAKE UP CALL FOR ENGLISH FOOTBALL GENERALLY TO SAY 
WELL WE HAVE TO SORT OF DEAL WITH PLAYERS LIKE HIDEGKUTI A SORT OF DEEP LYING STRIKER AND PUSKAS 
AND PLAYERS LIKE THAT AND THIS FANTASTIC POSSESSION FOOTBALL THEY PLAYED 
HUNGARY THEY ONLY GAVE YOU THE BALL BACK WHEN THEY'D SCORED AND WERE JOGGING BACK TO THE HALFWAY LINE 
SO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A GO NOW AND STOP GIVING IT TO US SO CHEAPLY 
AND THERE IS THE WHISTLE IT'S ALL OVER 
ENGLAND THREE HUNGARY SIX 
THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY AGAINST CONTINENTALS 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN CUP FINAL IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE A SIMILAR GAME 
TO THE NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN CUP FINAL TO ALMOST THE NINETEEN OH SEVEN CUP FINAL 
BECAUSE OF THIS ISOLATION IT HADN'T TAKEN IN INFLUENCE FROM EUROPE FROM SOUTH AMERICA 
SO THEREFORE IT WAS THE SAME AS IT ALWAYS WAS 
THE HUNGARY DEFEAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A WATERSHED IN ENGLISH FOOTBALL 
BUT THE FIFTY SEVEN CUP FINAL SHOWED THAT THE LONG BALL WAS STILL 
THE FAVOURED TACTIC IN THE DOMESTIC GAME 
COLEMAN OUT TO PECK 
WITH ELEVEN MINUTES TO GO BEFORE HALF TIME 
AND NO SUBSTITUTES ALLOWED THE CUP FINAL WAS ABOUT TO TAKE A DRAMATIC AND UNBELIEVABLE TWIST 
NOT OUT OF PLAY IT'S GOING TO BE A CORNER NO THROW IN 
RAY WOOD IS COMING BACK RAY WOOD IS COMING BACK HE'S BEHIND THE VILLA GOAL 
A TREMENDOUS CHEER FROM THE MANCHESTER CONTINGENT THERE'S RAY WOOD 
WHO WAS THIS FORLORN FIGURE STAGGERING ON THE TOUCHLINE 
IT'S RAY WOOD THEY ARE BRINGING HIM ON AGAIN 
AND WHAT'S MORE NO ONE IS SAYING DO YOU THINK RAY CLEARLY YOU HAVE LOST ALL KIND OF MENTAL CAPACITY 
CLEARLY YOU MAY DIE ANY MINUTE DO YOU THINK PERHAPS THE HOSPITAL 
DO YOU THINK PERHAPS YOU SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR 
D'YOU THINK YOU SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE 
THE SIGNAL AND ON COMES RAY WOOD 
AND HE'S GOING WAY OVER THE FAR SIDE TO OUTSIDE RIGHT 
UNKNOWN TO HIS TEAM MATES AND THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FANS LOOKING ON 
RAY WOOD HAD ACTUALLY BROKEN HIS CHEEKBONE 
HE'S CARRYING ONE OF THOSE PADS FOOTBALLERS CARRY WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT 
SOAKED IN SOME AMMONIA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SOME FOUL SMELLING SOLUTION ANYWAY 
MANCHESTER UNITED WERE FORCED TO REORGANISE THEIR WHOLE TEAM BECAUSE OF WOOD'S INJURY 
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF ROONEY HAD BEEN TOLD NO YOU CAN'T BRING ANYONE ELSE ON 
PETR CECH HAS TO COME BACK FROM HOSPITAL AND GO BACK ON 
AND PLAY LEFT WING AND HOBBLE ROUND FOR THE REST OF THE GAME 
AND YOU'VE GOT TO STICK JOHN TERRY IN GOAL 
JACKIE BLANCHFLOWER PLAYED WELL IN GOAL THEN YOU'VE GOT TO STICK 
YOUR BEST MIDFIELDER DUNCAN EDWARDS AT CENTRE HALF 
SO FRANK LAMPARD'S PLAYING CENTRE HALF SO THE GAME COMPLETELY CHANGED 
FOR ME THAT SPOILT THE CUP FINAL 
D'YOU THINK WE'LL SEE RAY WOOD IN GOAL IN THE SECOND HALF 
I DON'T THINK SO KEN NO I THINK IT WAS HIS SHOULDER THAT'S BEEN PROBABLY VERY BADLY KNOCKED ABOUT 
BY THE WAY HE WAS HOLDING IT 
I THINK THIS LONG SPELL HAS TAKEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OUT OF THEM 
I'VE BEEN WATCHING COLEMAN 
AND HE APPEARS TO BE THAT HALF A YARD SLOWER NOW 
I THINK THIS TWENTY FIVE MINUTES THEY'VE BEEN WITHOUT A GOALKEEPER HAS TAKEN 
AN AWFUL TOLL ON THEIR STAMINA I'M SURE OF THAT 
AS THE HALF TIME WHISTLE BLOWS BOTH CUP FINALS ARE STUCK AT ZERO TO ZERO 
AND THE REFEREE HAS BLOWN HIS WHISTLE FOR HALF TIME 
WHILE TODAY'S PLAYERS REHYDRATE ON SPORTS DRINKS 
THE HALF TIME BREAK FIFTY YEARS AGO WAS LESS HEALTH CONSCIOUS 
OH MY WORD OH MY WORD 
AT HALF TIME 
AT HALF TIME NEARLY EVERYBODY DASHED TO THE TOILET 
TO HAVE A SMOKE 
WHICH THEY DID I'M SURE THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT 
OR KNEW ABOUT IT 
BUT NOBODY SAID ANYTHING BUT I USED TO GO INTO THE TOILET AND A FEW OTHERS 
AND SMOKE UNTIL THE WHISTLE WENT AGAIN TO GO OUT AND PLAY 
FEW PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLERS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN SMOKE 
AND EVERY PART OF THEIR DIET IS CONTROLLED UNLIKE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
NO THEY CERTAINLY DIDN'T GIVE US ANY IDEA 
ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD EAT OR ANYTHING 
WHEREAS NOW IT'S LOOKED UPON AS PART AND PARCEL OF THE GAME 
TODAY FINNEY'S FORMER CLUB PRESTON NORTH END EMPLOY A CHEF 
SPECIALLY TO PREPARE MEALS FOR ITS PLAYERS 
WE KEEP IT AS LOW FAT AS POSSIBLE 
LEAN MEATS USE VERY LITTLE OIL TO COOK AND WHAT HAVE YOU 
I ALWAYS MAKE SURE BEFORE MATCH DAY THAT THEY ARE HAVING PASTA AND RICE 
AND START CARBOHYDRATE LOADING SO THEY HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY STORES FOR THE MATCH REALLY 
APART FROM THAT IT'S UP TO MY DISCRETION 
PLENTY OF FRESH FRUIT SALADS YOGHURTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU 
THE BEST ONE THAT I DO IS DICED CHICKEN 
PEPPERS ONIONS PEAS SWEET CORN LOTS OF DIFFERENT VEGETABLES 
THEN A LOW FAT DRESSING ON IT SWEET RED PEPPER DRESSING AND PASTA ALTOGETHER 
AND LASAGNE IS A POPULAR ONE AS AN ALTERNATIVE RED MEAT BECAUSE IT IS QUITE LEAN 
I DO THAT AT LEAST ONCE EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS BECAUSE THEY EAT A LOT OF SALAD 
IT'S A GOOD WAY OF GETTING THEM TO EAT SALAD BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT AT THE BEST OF TIMES 
BUT YEAH I DO A SIMILAR SORT OF THING WITH THE RICE LOTS OF VEG 
TRY NOT TO COOK EVERYTHING TOO MUCH COS YOU LOSE ALL THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE WHEN YOU DO THAT 
SO JUST KEEP THINGS AL DENTE REALLY THEN THEY GET THE BEST OUT OF IT 
SO THEY EAT QUITE A WIDE RANGE I'VE STILL NOT GOT THEM ON FISH AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO 
BUT IF I DON'T FEED THEM CHICKEN THEY WON'T EAT ANYTHING ELSE 
WE HAVE A BATTLE WITH THEM AND YOU GET A BIT OF WHAT'S THIS 
IF YOU TELL THEM IT'S CHICKEN THEY'LL EAT IT IT MIGHT BE PRAWN BUT IT GETS GOOD STUFF INTO THEM 
THERE WAS LITTLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SPORTS NUTRITION IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
AND THE PLAYERS' DIET WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE FANS' 
IT WAS FANTASTIC 
THERE WAS THE BEER 
THERE WAS EAT WHAT YOU WANT TO EAT 
THERE WAS STEAK AND CHIPS 
PLENTY OF FISH AND CHIPS 
I'VE NEVER BEEN TOLD WHAT TO EAT 
WHAT TO DRINK OR ANYTHING 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED YOUR PRE MATCH MEAL WAS STEAK 
YOU KNOW BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THAT WAS WHAT YOU NEEDED TO GIVE YOURSELF SOME STRENGTH 
BACK AT WEMBLEY RAY WOOD STAYS IN THE DRESSING ROOM WHILE THE TEAMS TAKE THE FIELD FOR THE SECOND HALF 
NO DOUBT HOPING THEIR PRE MATCH STEAK WILL GIVE THEM THE ENERGY THEY NEED TO SCORE THAT FIRST GOAL 
AND NOW WE START THE SECOND HALF 
ASTON VILLA TO KICK OFF NO SCORE 
MANCHESTER UNITED AGAIN WITH TEN MEN 
THE PLAYERS KICKING OFF THE SECOND HALF IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN DON'T NEED THE BULK 
OF THE FIFTY SEVEN DIET BECAUSE THE GAME NOW IS ALL ABOUT AGILITY AND FITNESS 
THIS NEED FOR SPEED IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY ADVANCES 
IN THE BOOTS THEY WEAR AND THE BALL THEY PLAY WITH 
THE HEAVY LEATHER FOOTBALL OF NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN WAS BOTH HARDER TO CONTROL 
AND FAR LESS EASY TO DIRECT WHEN PASSING OR SHOOTING 
IT RETAINED WATER AND IF IT RAINED THE BALL COULD DOUBLE IN WEIGHT 
OF COURSE THE BALL WAS VERY WELL IT WAS HEAVY 
IT HAD A BIG LACE STITCHED AROUND IT 
AND WE USED TO PUT A BLADDER IN AND PUMP IT AND MAKE THE LACE STRAIGHT 
AND EVERYBODY USED TO SAY DON'T PUT THE LACE POINTING TO ME WHEN YOU KICK IT 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE JOKES OF THE DAY 
I CAN REMEMBER AS A WINGER TAKING A CORNER KICK 
ON A DAY WHEN IT WAS POURING DOWN AND THE PITCH WAS EXTREMELY HEAVY 
IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET THE BALL INTO THE CENTRE 
AND I THINK NOW THEY CAN SCORE A GOAL FROM THIRTY AND FORTY YARDS 
AND ABSOLUTELY FLY INTO THE NET 
ONLY FIVE MINUTES INTO THE SECOND HALF 
UNITED WINGER DAVID PEGG HAS THE GAME'S FIRST REAL CLEAR CHANCE ON GOAL 
EDWARDS 
UP TO PEGG 
BUT THE SHOT WITH THE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN LEATHER BALL WAS NEITHER QUICK NOR ACCURATE ENOUGH 
THE FIFTIES BALL WAS KICKED AROUND ON HEAVY MUD SOAKED PITCHES 
UNRECOGNISABLE BY TODAY'S STANDARDS 
IT'S VERY EASY FOR ME TO SAY THIS BUT YOU LOOK AT PRESTON'S GROUND TODAY AND IT'S LIKE A BOWLING GREEN 
I CERTAINLY THINK THAT THE PLAYERS HAVE IT FAR FAR BETTER 
THAN WHAT WE HAD IN THOSE DAYS 
I THINK THE KIT YOU KNOW IS OBVIOUSLY VERY VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS IN OUR DAY 
WHEN I LOOK AT THE BOOTS THAT WE PLAYED IN AND I LOOK AT THE BOOTS THEY ARE PLAYING WITH NOW 
AND THE KIT GENERALLY IS YOU KNOW 
VERY OUTDATED IN PRESENT DAY TIMES 
EVERYTHING IS STREAMLINED AND IS MADE FOR SPEED REALLY 
AND I THINK THE GAME IS VERY VERY GOOD TO WATCH TODAY 
AND I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY THAT IT HAS IMPROVED 
ANOTHER IMPROVEMENT IN THE MODERN GAME IS THEIR USE OF SUBSTITUTES 
IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS ADVANCE RAY WOOD WHO HAD CONTINUED TO RECEIVE THE WET SPONGE 
AND SMELLING SALTS BEHIND THE SCENES AMAZINGLY EMERGED AGAIN 
TO PLAY ON THE WING FOR UNITED 
TAYLOR 
AND RAY WOOD IS COMING BACK 
RAY WOOD IS COMING BACK 
AND THIS TIME THERE HE IS STILL LOOKS A BIT GROGGY 
BUT NOT AS GROGGY AS HE DID WHEN HE CAME BACK IN THE FIRST HALF 
THIS WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY EXAMPLE OF WHAT PLAYERS OF THAT ERA MIGHT HAVE TO ENDURE 
WITH NO SUBSTITUTES TO CALL ON 
A GREAT CHEER FOR RAY WOOD DOING A SPOT OF STANLEY MATTHEWS ON THAT RIGHT WING 
THIS FLASH OF SKILL FROM RAY WOOD SEEMS UNREMARKABLE TO MODERN EYES 
BUT WAS QUITE A RARE DISPLAY IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
EVEN THE AVERAGE PREMIERSHIP PLAYER HAS AN IMPRESSIVE ABILITY 
TO CONTROL THE BALL COMPARED WITH THE PLAYERS FIFTY YEARS AGO 
AND THE STARS OF THIS YEAR'S CUP FINAL HAVE A SKILL LEVEL 
WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE GAME AS A SPECTACLE 
I THINK RONALDO IS AN OUTSTANDING PLAYER 
HE IS GOOD TO WATCH 
ALL SPECTATORS WANT TO SEE HIM PLAY 
BECAUSE HE HAS SO MUCH BALL CONTROL 
AND TRICKS ON THE BALL 
AND HE'S A VERY GOOD PLAYER FOR THE TEAM 
I MEAN THEY CAN RELY ON HIM AND PROBABLY THE SPECTATORS EXPECT 
FAR MORE THAN WHAT HE DOES IN CERTAIN GAMES 
THE REASON FOR THIS MASSIVE SKILLS GAP IS DOWN TO DIFFERENCES IN TRAINING 
AT PRESTON NORTH END MANAGER PAUL SIMPSON ENSURES THAT ALL HIS SQUAD NOT JUST STAR PLAYERS 
HAVE EXCELLENT CONTROL OF THE BALL THROUGH DAILY PRACTICE 
YOU TRY AND PUT THEM IN SITUATIONS THAT ARE GAME RELATED 
AND AS CLOSE TO MATCH PRACTICE AS YOU CAN 
WE DO IT IN A SMALL SIDED AREA SO IT IS QUITE INTENSE 
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DID TRAIN IN DAYS GONE BY 
BUT THIS IS WHAT WE TRY TO DO 
GOOD 
YOU NEED TO BE TECHNICALLY ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE FOOTBALL AT PACE WHEN YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE 
SO WE TRY TO DO SKILL TECHNIQUES EVERY DAY 
SO IT JUST BECOMES REPETITIVE AND IT BECOMES A NATURAL HABIT TO THEM 
AND I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT THE TECHNIQUE IS THERE 
WE PUT FORFEITS ONTO THEM SO IF THEY DO MESS UP THEY HAVE TO DO A COUPLE OF PRESS UPS 
SO IT MAKES EVERYONE CONCENTRATE A BIT HARDER 
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE GAME 
ON YOUR TOES AGAIN SAME THING JUST A HALF VOLLEY 
LEFT AND RIGHT LITTLE HALF VOLLEY 
NICE AND EASY 
CONCENTRATE ON THE BALL 
DON'T YOU GET NERVOUS 
WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET NERVOUS 
THEY WILL ALL GO INSIDE NOW AND THERE IS LUNCH ON FOR THEM 
WE'VE GOT PHYSIOS AND A MASSEUR IN THERE IF ANYONE WANTS A MASSAGE THEY CAN HAVE THAT 
BUT TOMORROW IS A REST DAY FOR THEM SO I IMAGINE A FEW OF THEM WILL JUST GO AND HAVE SOME FOOD 
AND JUST GO HOME AND REST NOW FOR A DAY AND A HALF 
PLAYERS IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN RARELY TRAINED WITH THE BALL INSTEAD THEY WERE PUT THROUGH THEIR PACES 
IN A SERIES OF BASIC EXERCISES LEARNT FROM THE BRITISH ARMY 
IT'S PRETTY STRENUOUS BEING A FOOTBALLER 
THERE'S PLENTY OF WORK IN THE GYMNASIUM 
MEDICAL SCIENCE PLAYS ITS PART RIGHT HALF PHIL GUNTER DOES SOME LEG MUSCLE EXERCISES 
THE FITNESS LEVELS WERE NOWHERE NEAR WHAT THEY ARE NOW 
BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A GREAT DEAL OF MEASUREMENT OF FITNESS 
THERE WASN'T THE NUTRITION OR THE RECOVERY PERIOD NONE OF THAT 
I MEAN IT SEEMS VERY BASIC I BECAME A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLER IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO 
FIVE YEARS AFTER THE FIFTY SEVEN FINAL 
SO NOT A LOT HAD CHANGED 
YOU WOULD GO INTO PRE SEASON TRAINING 
AND THERE WOULD BE FELLAS WEARING WHAT THEY CALLED SWEAT BAGS 
BECAUSE THE SEASON HAD ENDED IN APRIL AND DIDN'T START UNTIL SEPTEMBER 
THERE WAS A MASSIVE FOURTEEN WEEK GAP 
A LOT OF RUNNING 
AND THEN OF COURSE THEY USED TO GO UP AND DOWN 
THEY USED TO RUN UP AND DOWN THE TERRACING UP AND DOWN THE STEPS 
THERE USED TO BE A LOT OF THAT 
AND I CAN REMEMBER IN SIXTY TWO 
MY FIRST PRE SEASON COMING IN I CAN REMEMBER QUITE A NUMBER OF 
PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLERS BEING SICK COS THEY WOULD RUN AND RUN AND RUN 
AFTER THE TRAINING HAD FINISHED IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EVENTUALLY GOING TO A PUB 
PROBABLY YES IT WAS WASN'T IT 
YEAH 
THIS PHYSICAL TRAINING WAS DESIGNED TO PREPARE THE PLAYERS 
FOR A TOUGH LONG BALL GAME AND MIDWAY THROUGH THE SECOND HALF 
A CLASSIC PIECE OF DIRECT PLAY LED TO THE DEADLOCK OF THE FIFTY SEVEN FINAL 
BEING BROKEN BY AN UNLIKELY HERO 
THE ANTICIPATION MOVING TO THE BALL FIRST TIME MCPARLAND 
THE CROWD WERE BOOING ME THE MANCHESTER UNITED SUPPORTERS WERE GIVING ME STICK 
NOW MCPARLAND ACCOMPANIED AGAIN BY THAT SILLY BOOING 
AND THE TRAINER COME OVER TO ME AND HE SAID 
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO SHUT THEM UP 
STICK THE BALL IN THE BACK OF THE NET 
DIXON 
MCPARLAND A GOAL A GOAL BY MCPARLAND 
TWENTY ONE MINUTES OF THE SECOND HALF GONE 
THE VILLA FANS WERE JUBILANT BUT FOR UNITED IT WAS A CRUEL TWIST 
TO SEE THE PLAYER WHO'D INJURED RAY WOOD CELEBRATING HIS FIRST GOAL AT WEMBLEY 
FOR FRACTIONS OF A SECOND I THOUGHT I'VE SCORED AT WEMBLEY I'VE DONE WHAT I WANTED TO DO 
AND IT WAS THAT FEELING FOR THAT SECOND 
EVERYTHING WAS TIMED RIGHT ON THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT 
AND I BELTED THE BALL ON MY HEAD 
IT WAS AN ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC HEADER THAT I GOT 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT 
TO THE FOOTBALL ANALYSTS OF TODAY THE GOAL IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF POSSESSION BEING LOST TOO EASILY 
HERE'S A GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE THE MOVE INITIALLY CAME FROM A MAN U. ATTACK WHICH BROKE DOWN 
IT WAS TOMMY TAYLOR WHO LOST THE BALL 
AND THE BALL GOES FROM FULL BACK TO WINGER 
ACROSS INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARK 
THEN THE ATTEMPTS ON THE CROSS TAKE PLACE 
AND ONE OF THEM'S SUCCESSFUL 
YEAH IT'S A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW DIRECT THE PLAY WOULD BE 
OUT TO SMITH 
BYRNE TO WHELAN 
SMITH 
AGAIN IT'S WHELAN AND ONCE AGAIN IT'S SMITH 
THE CROSS COMES IN ONTO MCPARLAND 
IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD CROSS AND A VERY GOOD FINISH 
CONSIDERING THE WEIGHT OF THE BALLS AND THE DISTANCE HE WAS OUT 
FOR A HEADER OF THAT POWER IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE A GOOD FINISH 
ONLY SIX MINUTES LATER 
A GOALMOUTH SCRAMBLE GAVE MCPARLAND A CHANCE TO DOUBLE VILLA'S LEAD 
DIXON 
GOAL MCPARLAND 
MCPARLAND HAS SCORED AGAIN 
I WAS ON THE FAR POST I HAD A HEADER BACK INTO THE GOALMOUTH 
JOHNNY DIXON TURNED ON IT AND SMACKED IT OFF THE CROSSBAR 
THE BALL HIT THE CROSSBA R. 
WENT INTO THE AIR 
AND I COME BACK FROM THE FAR POST 
INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE GOALMOUTH 
AND VOLLEYED IT 
THE SECOND VILLA GOAL COMES 
FROM ANOTHER BREAKDOWN IN POSSESSION BY MAN U. 
INITIALLY THEY THROW THE BALL OUT LOSE IT REGAIN IT 
TRY TO PLAY IT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK AND LOSE IT THERE 
WHERE VILLA ATTACK AND THEY PUSHED THE BALL OUT TO THE RIGHT WING 
AND THE CROSS COMES IN 
IT'S NOT REALLY CLEARED PARTICULARLY WELL AND MCPARLAND 
ON HIS THIRD ATTEMPT MANAGES TO PUT IT IN 
THE BALL'S HIT THE POST IT RICOCHETS AROUND A BIT 
BEFORE MCPARLAND PUTS IT IN 
MCPARLAND HAS SCORED AGAIN 
IT STRUCK ME AFTER PETER MCPARLAND'S FIRST GOAL HE DOES AN UNSELFCONSCIOUS LITTLE JIG 
I THOUGHT HERE'S A MAN WHO HAS NEVER SEEN HIMSELF ON TELEVISION 
AND CELEBRATIONS THESE DAYS ARE ALL FOR THE CAMERAS 
YOU CAN TELL THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE USED TO BEING SEEN THEY REALISE WHAT THEY'LL LOOK LIKE ON T. V. 
COS THEY'VE SEEN THEMSELVES THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE 
THIS MAN PLAYS IN ONE GAME IN HIS CAREER PERHAPS 
THAT'S TELEVISED AND IT'S GONNA BE TELEVISED LIVE 
HOW CAN HE SEE HIMSELF THERE ARE NO VIDEO RECORDERS 
SO IT'S THAT WHOLE SELF REFERENTIAL TELEVISION ERA 
WHERE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE WAY IT'S GONNA LOOK AND THE VOCABULARY AND GRAMMAR OF TELEVISION 
IT'S REFRESHINGLY FREE OF THAT 
TWENTY ONE MINUTES OF THE SECOND HALF GONE 
WHEN DIDIER DROGBA PUTS CHELSEA ONE TO ZERO UP 
THE CAMERA'S ON HAND TO CAPTURE THE NOW FAMILIAR RITUAL 
OF THE GOALSCORER'S CELEBRATIONS 
WITH FIVE MINUTES TO GO IN EXTRA TIME DROGBA HAS SCORED FOR CHELSEA 
YOU MIGHT ARGUE JOHN THE BEST FOOTBALL OF THE GAME 
DROGBA LAMPARD ONE TWO GREAT RETURN BALL FROM LAMPARD 
THESE CHOREOGRAPHED ROUTINES EXPRESS THE PLAYERS' SENSE OF THEIR OWN SELF WORTH AND ROLE AS SUPERSTARS 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN THERE WERE NO OVERT DEMONSTRATIONS OF SHOWMANSHIP 
BY THE PLAYERS JUST AS THERE WERE STRIKINGLY FEW EXAMPLES OF DISSENT 
AND A PUSH IN THE BACK 
BY DIXON ON WHELAN 
A FREE KICK TO MANCHESTER UNITED 
THERE TENDED NOT TO BE DISSENT THERE TENDED NOT TO BE PETULANCE 
HOWEVER IN THE FIFTY SEVEN FINAL THERE'S A MOMENT 
WHERE THE ASTON VILLA MIDFIELDER JACKIE SEWELL 
HAS A THROW IN GIVEN AGAINST HIM 
AND IN ONE MOMENT HE THROWS THE BALL DOWN 
THROW TO MANCHESTER 
AND YOU JUST THINK OH CRIKEY THAT'S JUST LIKE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
WHERE PLAYERS FEEL THAT THEY ARE THE KINGS OF THE GAME 
SO THEREFORE DISSENT ARGUING PETULANCE THEY'RE ALL TOLERATED 
WITHIN THE FOOTBALL COMMUNITY THEY'RE EXPECTED 
JACKIE SEWELL'S ACTION WAS ALMOST LIKE A LITTLE PEEK INTO A FUTURE AGE 
AND THERE'S A LINK THERE BETWEEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN 
THAT'S HOW FOOTBALL AND FOOTBALLERS WOULD GO 
WE HAVE IN FOOTBALL 
GONE BACK A LONG LONG WAY IN TERMS OF RESPECT AND MANNERS 
THAT WAS THE THING THAT MADE ME NOSTALGIC YOU KNOW 
THESE WERE PROPER MEN RATHER THAN SPOILT CHILDREN 
WITH THE CLOCK RUNNING DOWN AND UNITED TWO TO ZERO BEHIND 
RAY WOOD IS STILL ON THE PITCH 
RAY WOOD'S IN THERE TOO 
TAYLOR 
A GOAL TAYLOR HAS SCORED 
AND THERE'S TOMMY TAYLOR ENGLAND'S CENTRE FORWARD 
WHO REALLY BRINGS MANCHESTER UNITED BACK INTO THIS GAME 
TWO GOALS TO ONE NOW 
AND THERE ARE EIGHT MINUTES LEFT FOR PLAY EIGHT MINUTES PLUS ANY ADDITIONS FOR INJURIES 
WALLY BARNES ARE THEY GOING TO PULL IT OUT OF THE BAG 
THEY COULD WELL DO BECAUSE VILLA HAVE CHANGED THEIR TACTICS 
IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES AND GONE ON THE DEFENSIVE 
RAY WOOD IS GOING BACK INTO GOAL 
WELL THAT'S A GREAT MOVE 
HE'S JUST TAKING THE JERSEY THERE HE IS A TREMENDOUS CHEER 
JACKIE BLANCHFLOWER IS GOING CENTRE HALF DUNCAN EDWARDS IS MOVING UP TO LEFT HALF 
AND SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO SEE A GRANDSTAND FINISH I'M SURE 
AND THERE'S BLANCHFLOWER BROUGHT DOWN 
BUT THE REFEREE'S WAVED PLAY ON BECAUSE MANCHESTER UNITED ARE IN POSSESSION 
NOW CHARLTON 
A TREMENDOUS CHEER FOR WOOD TOUCHING THE BALL FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE HE CAME BACK INTO GOAL 
DESPITE WOOD'S HEROICS UNITED HAVE RUN OUT OF TIME 
LOOKING AT HIS WATCH 
AND THE WHISTLE HAS GONE VILLA HAVE WON THE CUP 
VILLA HAVE WON THE CUP 
AND IT'S MCPARLAND WHO'S WON THE CUP FOR VILLA 
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY MARVELLOUS THE FEELING THAT YOU'VE WON THE CUP JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT 
WHEN YOU JUST THROW YOUR ARMS UP IN THE AIR AND RUN AROUND JUMPING ON EACH OTHER 
AND THEY'VE WON THE CUP FOR THE SEVENTH TIME A RECORD IN THE HISTORY OF THE COMPETITION 
OH WE WENT BERSERK WE RAN ROUND AND WE RAN TO THE CROWD 
AND WE YELLED AND YELLED AND YELLED 
FLUNG OUR ARMS UP AND YEAH 
WE WENT ABSOLUTELY BERSERK 
EVEN IN THE DRAMA OF THE FINAL WHISTLE THE PLAYERS' SENSE OF 
SPORTSMANSHIP TOWARDS THEIR OPPONENTS SHINES THROUGH 
OH AT THE END OF THE GAME IT'S HAND TO HAND 
YOU GO TO SHAKE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE OTHER SIDE AND THEY SHAKE YOUR HAND 
I HAD THE FEELING THAT I WENT TO RAY WOODS YOU KNOW AND HAD A CHAT TO HIM 
AND THERE THE TWO MEN IN THIS UNFORTUNATE CLASH 
AND I'M SURE RAY WOODS BEARS HIM NO ILL WILL 
WINNING THE F. A. CUP FINAL IS STILL A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE FOOTBALL STARS OF TODAY 
BUT THE RITUAL OF RECEIVING THE CUP FROM THE ROYAL FAMILY 
IS PERHAPS NOT SO DAUNTING FOR PLAYERS WHO ARE ALREADY CELEBRITIES AND MILLIONAIRES 
FIFTY YEARS AGO THE LONG WALK UP THE STEPS TO MEET HER MAJESTY WAS A VERY BIG DEAL INDEED 
AND MANCHESTER UNITED AS GREAT SPORTSMAN APPLAUDING THE VICTORIOUS VILLA SIDE 
WITH MATT BUSBY 
I THINK THAT THE WALK UP IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT ESPECIALLY IF YOU WIN YOU KNOW 
AND VILLA SUPPORTERS WERE NEARBY THERE SO THEY WERE CLAPPING 
HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN WITH THE F. A. CUP 
SIR STANLEY ROUSE ON HER LEFT ARTHUR DRURY ON THE RIGHT 
AND JOHNNY DIXON COMES TO RECEIVE THE TROPHY 
WE HAD TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HER AND SHE WORE A PAIR OF GLOVES 
WHICH IS NOT SURPRISING REALLY BUT I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY FUNNY 
AND I THINK SHE RECOGNISED ME FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR FINAL 
COS SHE TURNED TO HER SISTER AND WENT THAT'S HIM 
THE SEVENTH ASTON VILLA CAPTAIN TO RECEIVE IT 
BEHIND HIM JACKIE SEWELL WHO UNTIL JOHN CHARLES WAS TRANSFERRED 
WAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE FOOTBALLER IN BRITAIN 
THE VICTORIOUS VILLA PLAYERS ALL HAVE A LOOK 
AT THAT MEDAL THEY WORKED SO HARD FOR AND COVET SO MUCH 
THE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN F. A. CUP FINAL WAS THE FINAL CHAPTER OF A FORGOTTEN ERA IN ENGLISH FOOTBALL 
IT REMAINS THE LAST TIME ASTON VILLA WON THE CUP 
IT WAS ALSO THE LAST TIME THAT UNITED TEAM PLAYED TOGETHER IN A MAJOR CUP FINAL 
THE FOLLOWING YEAR EIGHT OF THE BUSBY BABES 
INCLUDING DUNCAN EDWARDS DAVID PEGG AND TOMMY TAYLOR 
WERE KILLED IN THE MUNICH AIR CRASH 
DESPITE THIS DISASTER ENGLISH CLUBS SHOOK OFF THE CHAINS OF ISOLATION 
AND BEGAN TO COMPETE REGULARLY IN EUROPE OVER THE NEXT DECADE 
AND IT WAS A MANCHESTER UNITED SQUAD LED BY BRITAIN'S FIRST CELEBRITY FOOTBALLER 
WHICH BECAME THE FIRST ENGLISH TEAM TO WIN THE EUROPEAN CUP 
A NEW FOOTBALL ERA WAS BEGINNING LEAVING BEHIND THE LOST WORLD OF THE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN CUP FINAL 
AND RAPIDLY MOVING TOWARDS THE KIND OF GAME ON SHOW AT WEMBLEY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN
