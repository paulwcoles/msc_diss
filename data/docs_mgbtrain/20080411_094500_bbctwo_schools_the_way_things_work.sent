WELL YOU CAN WORK IT OUT IF YOU JUST LEARN ABOUT 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN RIDE OR BUMP AND JUMP 
OR GLIDE AND SLIDE YOU OUGHTA TAKE A LITTLE LOOK INSIDE 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
AND WATCH THE THINGAMABOB THAT TURNS THE KNOB 
THAT MAKES THE JIGGER JIG 
THAT TURNS THE THINGAMAJIG THAT PULLS THE TRIGGER 
THAT MAKES THE DIGGER DIG 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN FLY 
WITHOUT A WING OR STRING TO TIE WITH 
IT'S FEEDING TIME ON MAMMOTH ISLAND 
GREAT HAIRY BEASTS IN NEED OF A MEAL 
AND WHAT HAPPENS 
THEY CLOG UP ALL THE PATHWAYS 
IN THEIR MAMMOTH RUSH TO FILL THEIR BELLIES 
OW WATCH YER GREAT CLODHOPPERS ARGH 
ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH I ADVISED THE ISLANDERS TO DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT THE TRAFFIC JAMS BEFORE SOMEONE GOT HURT OW OR MORE HURT 
THE ISLANDERS NEEDED TO BUILD SOME DECENT ROADS FOR THE MAMMOTHS 
BUT DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHERE TO START 
O. K. THAT'S IT YOU CAN DO IT 
HEAVE HO 
HEAVE HO HEAVE HO 
COME ON GUYS JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER YOU CAN DO IT 
ROADS ARE MADE UP OF LAYERS OF GRAVEL AND TAR 
SO THE FIRST THING THEY HAD TO DO WAS MAKE SOME GRAVEL 
THIS WASN'T PROVING SO EASY 
DROPPING A BOULDER FROM A TOWER WAS ALL VERY WELL 
GETTING A BOULDER UP THERE WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY 
OH NO OH DEAR 
ARE YOU O. K. PILBEAM 
NO 
NO GRAVEL NO ROADS 
AH THE END OF A GRAND IDEA 
GRAVEL WE'VE GOT TO HAVE GRAVEL 
GOT IT 
LET'S JUST CHUCK A BOULDER OFF HERE 
IT'LL SMASH INTO GRAVEL FOR SURE 
THE ISLANDERS HAD REALISED 
THAT A RAMP WAS MUCH SIMPLER THAN TOWERS AND ROPES 
COME ON MAMMOTH WE HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY 
YEAH IT'S UP IT'S UP 
COME ON YOU GREAT HAIRY MONSTER GET IT UP THAT RAMP 
HOW'S IT GOING YOUR END PILBEAM FINE FRANK 
THE ISLANDERS HAD DISCOVERED THE PRINCIPLE 
BEHIND SOME OF THE EARLIEST MACHINES INVENTED 
THE WEDGE OR INCLINED PLANE 
THE BOULDER HAD TO BE PUSHED FURTHER UP THE INCLINE 
THAN UP THE VERTICAL FACE 
THE FORCE REQUIRED WAS MUCH LESS 
BECAUSE THE WEIGHT OF THE BOULDER WAS BEING SHARED 
BETWEEN THE MAMMOTH AND THE SLOPE 
NEVER MIND MY MAMMOTH'S GETTING THERE 
THAT'S IT GENTLY DOES IT NOW 
BIT OF A NEAR MISS EH PILBEAM YOU ALL RIGHT 
YEAH FINE FRANK THANKS 
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE BACK IN THE GRAVEL BUSINESS 
THE ISLANDERS NOW KNEW 
THAT AN INCLINED PLANE IS A SIMPLE MACHINE 
TO ALLOW A SMALL EFFORT TO MOVE A LARGE LOAD 
COME ON LADS WE'VE DONE ALL THE HARD WORK 
PILBEAM HELP I CAN'T HOLD THIS BOULDER MUCH LONGER 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GETTING HELP I DID 
UNLESS THAT TURNS INTO TEN BIG STRONG MEN YOU'RE IN TROUBLE 
WHAT THIS LITTLE THING KEEPS THAT HUGE BOULDER FROM FALLING 
OLIVE HAD FOUND ANOTHER USE FOR AN INCLINED PLANE 
WHICH IS WHAT A WEDGE IS 
GO ON WEDGE IT OLIVE 
NOW THE ISLANDERS HAD WORKED OUT HOW TO MAKE THEIR GRAVEL 
THEIR NEXT PROBLEM WAS HOW TO BUILD THE BRIDGE OVER THE STREAM 
PUSH PULL 
PUSH PULL PUSH PULL 
I A. M. PUSH PUSHING OH 
OH NOT AGAIN I WISH WE HAD A BETTER SAW 
H. M. M. I DON'T THINK THE SAW IS THE PROBLEM 
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN PILBEAM PUT YOUR BACK INTO IT MAN EH 
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY USING A WEDGE AGAIN 
IN HERE THE INVENTOR SAYS THEY HAVE LOADS OF USES 
WELL NO HARM GIVING IT A TRY I SUPPOSE NOW WHAT 
WHY DON'T WE TRY HITTING THE WEDGE FRANK O. K. AGH 
ARGH OW NICE ONE OLIVE 
THE ISLANDERS HAD DISCOVERED 
THAT IF YOU PUSH HARD ON A WEDGE THAT IS INSERTED INTO A LOG 
THEN A FORCE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE WEDGE BLADE PUSHES THE LOG APART 
I THINK I'VE GOT AN EVEN BETTER IDEA 
HOW ABOUT IF WE PUT A HANDLE ON THIS WEDGE OH YEAH 
LOADS EASIER TO CARRY NOW ISN'T IT 
NO UNCLE PILBEAM IT'S ANOTHER WAY OF SPLITTING WOOD 
GO ON TROY WHACK IT ONE 
THAT WAS A BIT OF LUCK EH TROY 
THAT'S NOT LUCK IT'S THE WAY THINGS WORK AGAIN TROY 
TROY HAD MADE AN AXE 
ARGH ARE YOU CRAZY OR WHAT 
OLIVE WAS RIGHT THOUGH 
AN AXE IS JUST A WEDGE ATTACHED TO A SHAFT 
THE SHAFT IS USED AS A LEVER TO SWING THE AXE HEAD AT HIGH SPEED 
THIS INCREASES THE DOWNWARD FORCE 
AND SPLITS THE LOG WITH EVEN MORE EASE 
A WEDGE IS EVEN USED TO KEEP THE AXE HEAD ON 
A PLOUGH IS ANOTHER USE OF A WEDGE 
THE WEDGE IS DRAGGED THROUGH THE GROUND BY AN ANIMAL OR TRACTOR 
WOODEN PLOUGHS HAVE BEEN IN USE FOR OVER FIVE THOUSAND YEARS 
THEY ARE ONE OF OUR OLDEST MACHINES 
AND ARE USED TO PREPARE THE GROUND FOR PLANTING CROPS 
WHAT'S THIS OLIVE TAR UNCLE PILBEAM WHAT FOR 
THE INVENTOR SAYS YOU USE IT FOR STICKING THE GRAVEL TOGETHER 
THEN YOU SQUASH IT TO MAKE A ROAD 
UH HUH AND HOW DOES THAT INVENTOR OF YOURS SUGGEST WE OPEN IT 
I'LL CRACK IT OPEN WITH MY AXE 
NOT A GOOD IDEA TROY OH NO NO TROY WASN'T COMPLETELY WRONG 
YOU CAN USE A WEDGE TO OPEN A CAN 
BUT A SLIGHTLY MORE ADVANCED ONE THAN AN AXE LIKE THIS CAN OPENER 
THE WEDGE SHAPE IS ON THE CUTTER 
WHICH IS TURNED BY A HANDLE CONNECTED TO THESE SPUR GEARS HERE 
IT'S BEST NOT TO BE STANDING ON THE LID AFTER IT'S CUT AWAY ARGH 
IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THE ISLANDERS GOT THE HANG OF BOILING THE TAR 
LOOK AT THE MESS YOU'VE GOT THIS MAMMOTH IN 
H. M. M. YOU'RE RIGHT 
HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET ALL THAT OFF 
WITH A WEDGE OF COURSE 
OH NO 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE BIT DRASTIC ISN'T IT 
NO 
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS 
DON'T WORRY PILBEAM IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE 
TWO SERRATED BLADES MOVE TO AND FRO OVER EACH OTHER 
ACTING LIKE THE BLADES IN A PAIR OF SCISSORS THE TEETH OF THE SHEARS 
ACT AS WEDGES TWO WEDGES THAT CUT WITH GREAT FORCE 
H. M. M. WELL DONE FRANK 
YEAH WELL DONE PILBEAM 
BUT WHERE IS TROY 
YEAH WHERE IS TROY HE SAID HE HAD ANOTHER GOOD IDEA 
WHAT WAS THAT THEN DINNER 
OW WATCH YER GREAT CLODHOPPERS 
A A ARGH 
WE HAD A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS TODAY OLIVE 
BUT I DON'T THINK RINGING THE DINNER BELL WAS ONE OF THEM 
NO MAYBE NOT 
THIS PROGRAMME REQUIRES NO SUBTITLES
