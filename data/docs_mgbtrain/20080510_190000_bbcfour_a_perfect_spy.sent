CERTAIN ARISTOS IN WASHINGTON AND LONDON ARE GETTING WORRIED ABOUT OUR CZECHO NETWORKS 
THEY HAVE BEGUN TO DISCERN CERTAIN UNFORTUNATE PATTERNS 
WHAT PATTERNS THERE ARE NO PATTERNS 
THEY HAVE NOTICED THAT THE CZECHO NETWORKS PROVIDE BETTER INTELLIGENCE WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING THEM 
THAT IS WHEN WE ARE RUNNING THEM AND ALMOST NOTHING WHEN WE ARE NOT 
THAT IS A PATTERN IT BOTHERS THEM 
I DON'T SEE WHY IT SHOULD ALL NETWORKS GO MORIBUND NOW AND THEN IT'S NORMAL 
IT BOTHERS WASHINGTON 
JACK BROTHERHOOD'S RUNNING THOSE NETWORKS NOW EVERYONE KNOWS HE CAN DO IT AS WELL AS I CAN 
THE HEAD AGENTS ARE GENUINE THAT'S OUR SAFEGUARD THEY REPORT WHATEVER THEY CAN GET HOLD OF 
O. K. THE SUPPLY DROPS OFF WHEN WE'RE NOT THERE TO FEED IN THE PHONEY MATERIAL IT HAPPENS 
ONLY WHEN WE'RE NOT THERE THAT IS WASHINGTON'S PERCEPTION 
WE HAVE BEEN CARELESS SIR MAGNUS 
GIVE THE NETWORKS BETTER MATERIAL SIGNAL PRAGUE TELL YOUR ARISTOS WE NEED A SCOOP 
YOU KNOW PRAGUE THE MAN WHO IS ABSENT IS THE MAN THEY CONSPIRE AGAINST 
I HAVE NO POWER TO PERSUADE THEM 
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO RIDE IT OUT

WHO HAS DESTABILISED MORE BANKRUPT ECONOMIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA THAN ARE DREAMED OF 
AND SUPPED WITH THE GREATEST IN THE LAND FROM THE HEADS OF THE MAFIA DOWNWARDS 
AND WHO IS CIRCUMCISED 
FROM THE NECK UP 
MICK CARVER HEAD OF THE LONDON STATION A SPOILT BOSTON MILLIONAIRE 
CONSIDERED BRILLIANT ON NO EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT I'M AWARE OF 
FRANK ARTELLI FROM THE BRONX A WHIZ KID MATHEMATICIAN WHO SHOULD BE LISTENED TO 
BUT NO ONE WILL 
AND GRANT LEDERER THE THIRD THE PUSHY LITTLE LAW BOY FROM SOUTH BEND INDIANA 
AN AMBITIOUS JERK WHO HAPPENS TO BE MY BEST BUDDY IN AMERICA SELF APPOINTED 
HE'D GET BETWEEN THE SHEETS WITH ME IF I'D LET HIM 
LITTLE GRANT IS A CASSIUS LOOKING FOR A CAESAR 
IF HE DOESN'T FIND A BACK TO STAB SOON THE AGENCY WILL GIVE HIS DAGGER TO SOMEONE ELSE 
SURE HARRY 
JUST TO OPEN UP WITH WHO IS THIS GUY MAGNUS PYM 
CREDENTIALS COULDN'T BE BETTER

WHAT DOES HE DO WITH ALL THIS 
LET'S ASSUME HE MAKES SURE LONDON GETS A SIGHT OF SOME OF IT ANYWAY 
ANYBODY ELSE 
FRAID SO 
MARY I THINK OUR TWO KIDS ARE IN LOVE

THOSE TWO FAGS CAN'T KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF EACH OTHER 
FIRST TIME THEY MET JACKPOT 
HOLY COW BEE GRANT SAYS LIKE HE'S A TEN YEAR OLD THAT MAGNUS SOME PERSON 
MAGNUS SAID IF THAT'S GRANT LEDERER THE THIRD WHAT WERE THE FIRST TWO LIKE 
MAKE WHAT YOU LIKE OF THAT 
I'VE BEEN READING A GREAT DEAL RECENTLY ABOUT THE CREATIVITY OF THE CRIMINAL MIND 
IT GOT PRETTY CLOSE TO HOME BOY I TELL YOU 
TELL ME GRANT 
QUOTE 
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE MORALLY BETWEEN THE TOTALLY ANARCHIC CRIMINALITY OF THE ARTIST 
WHICH IS ENDEMIC IN CREATIVE MINDS 
AND THE ARTISTRY OF THE CRIMINAL 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT ONE CAN'T DO IT TOO MANY LONG WORDS 
HELL MAGNUS THAT'S U. S.

IT'S SELF RENEWAL A REBIRTH

THEY'RE IMMATURE 
STOP THIS NOW 
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I HATE MOST ABOUT THE WAY THE FIRM IS GOING 
THIS TO AMERICAN METHODS 
THEY COME BAYING FOR PYM'S BLOOD AND WHAT HAVE THEY GOT 
SOME NASTY FANCIFUL SUSPICIONS BASED ON NOTHING MORE THAN A FEW COMPUTERISED COINCIDENCES 
YOU GO ONE MORE YARD WITH THIS 
AND EVERYONE WHO TELLS THE TRUTH WILL BECOME A BAREFACED LIAR 
AND EVERYONE WHO DOES A DECENT JOB WILL BE WORKING FOR THE OTHER SIDE 
YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS AND YOU'LL SINK OUR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE RUSSIANS COULD 
OR IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT 
JACK OUR AMERICAN COUSINS HAVE PUT A LOT OF TIME INTO THIS 
THEY ARE SERIOUS 
THEY'RE NOT JUST STIRRING THE WATER 
TO SEE WHAT JUMPS OUT 
I BELIEVE LIKE YOU THAT THEY'RE WRONG ABOUT PYM BUT WE MUST LISTEN 
AND THEN SEND THEM ON THEIR WAY WHEN THEIR CASE FALLS APART 
WE'RE NOT GOING OVER THERE WEXLER CAN BRING HIS TEAM HERE 
I'LL WANT YOU AT THE MEETING JACK

JUST AN OLD JOE A VERY OLD JOE 
WHO TRACKED ME DOWN FEELING SENTIMENTAL 
WANTING ME TO HOLD HIS HAND 
USED TO BE QUITE A MONSTER THAT MAN BIG BAD WOLF IN THE GAME IN HIS TIME 
BIT OF A GHOST NOW 
A BIT OF THE PAST COME BACK TO HAUNT ME A RATTLING OF BONES IN THE NIGHT 
GENTLEMEN 
OUR POSITION THAT IS TO SAY THE AGENCY'S POSITION ON THIS THING 
AT THIS IMPORTANT MEETING AND AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME 
IS THAT WE HAVE AN ACCUMULATION OF INDICATORS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF SOURCES ON THE ONE HAND 
AND NEW DATA ON THE OTHER 
WHICH WE CONSIDER PRETTY MUCH CONCLUSIVE IN RESPECT OF OUR UNEASE 
IT LOOKS TO US THEREFORE 
THAT THE LOGISTICS HERE REQUIRE THAT WE GO BACK OVER THE COURSE A LITTLE DISTANCE 
AND ER WHEN WE'VE DONE THAT TO SLOT THE NEW STUFF IN 
WHERE WE CAN ALL TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT IT IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT HAS LATTERLY GONE BEFORE 
IF YOU WANT TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN ACCOMMODATE YOU 
MY DEAR CHAP YOU MUST DO WHATEVER MAKES YOU FEEL MOST COMFORTABLE 
GENTLEMEN 
OUR UNEASE CONCERNS THE PERIOD OF THE PAST FOUR YEARS 
WHEN THE INDICATORS AFOREMENTIONED 
PERSUADED US TO MAKE A SPECIAL STUDY OF PARTICULAR MOVEMENTS BOTH SIGNAL WISE AND PERSONNEL WISE 
RELATING TO CZECH INTELLIGENCE AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
FROM THE DATE WHEN MAGNUS RICHARD PYM WAS APPOINTED TO YOUR WASHINGTON STATION 
WHAT DID YOU FEED INTO THE COMPUTER 
NAMES AND RECORDS OF ALL WESTERN INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS PAST OR PRESENT IN WASHINGTON 
WITH ACCESS TO THE CZECH TARGET 
NAMES OF CZECH COURIERS OFFICIALS LEGAL AND ILLEGAL TRAVELLERS PASSING IN AND OUT OF THE U. S. 
PLUS PERSONAL DESCRIPTIONS TO COUNTERACT FALSE PASSPORTS 
DATES AND PURPOSES OF SUCH JOURNEYS 
FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF STAY 
NOW LATER GRANT 
OF COURSE GENTLEMEN INTO THAT INPUT WE INCORPORATED 
OUR GENERAL AWARENESS OF CZECH METHODOLOGY 
WITH REGARD TO THE SERVICING OF AND COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR AGENTS 
AH YOU MEAN TRADECRAFT HARRY 
WELL YES SIR I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I DO MEAN 
FRANK WILL YOU TAKE IT UP 
AS THE INDICATORS CONTINUED TO MULTIPLY 
WE REAPPRAISED THE CLANDESTINE RADIO SIGNALS FROM THE CZECH EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON 
OUR PEOPLE RECONSIDERED SKIP DISTANCES 
AND PROBABLE RECEPTION ZONES 
THEY MATCHED ALL INTERCEPTS AGAINST THE MOVEMENTS OF ELIGIBLE SUSPECTS 
HOLD ON A MINUTE ARTELLI 
THE POINT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE 
IS THAT EVERY TIME PYM LEFT THE PRECINCTS OF WASHINGTON WHETHER ON LEAVE OR A VISIT 
A SERIES OF CODED TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE CZECHS WAS DISCONTINUED 
YES RIGHT 
THE ASSUMPTION BEING THAT IF PYM WAS OUT OF RANGE OF THEIR WASHINGTON TRANSMITTER 
THE CZECHS WOULDN'T BOTHER TO TALK TO HIM 
YES SIR WELL TURN IT ROUND FOR A MOMENT WILL YOU 
IF YOU WERE FRAMING A MAN 
ISN'T THAT PRECISELY WHAT YOU WOULD DO 
NOT TODAY TEN YEARS AGO MAYBE WHY NOT 
I WOULDN'T BE THAT DUMB 
THE COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES WE OBSERVED WERE OUT OF FASHION 
YOU GET A FEEL A SMELL A SMELL OF AGE 
A SENSE OF LONG HABITUATION ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER YEARS MAYBE 
MY GOD HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO PUT THIS TO YOU 
FOR YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN CZECH TRANSMISSIONS 
STIRRING THE SHIT POT IN ANY PART OF THE GLOBE WHERE PYM SETS FOOT 
OF COURSE THEY COINCIDE WITH HIS MOVEMENTS 
THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY THE RADIO GAME WHEN YOU'RE FRAMING A MAN 
YOU PERSIST AND YOU REPEAT AND YOU WAIT 
UNTIL THE OTHER FELLOW'S NERVE CRACKS 
THE CZECHS AREN'T FOOLS SOMETIMES I THINK WE ARE 
THANK YOU FRANK 
GRANT WILL YOU TAKE IT UP WITH THE PRETZ HAMPEL ZAWORSKI SITUATION 
SO THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE 
HANS ALBRECHT PRETZ CZECHOSLOVAK JOURNALIST 
ALEXANDER HAMPEL IDENTIFIED AS LONG STANDING CZECH INTELLIGENCE OFFICER 
JERZY ZAWORSKI BORN CARLSBAD NINETEEN TWENTY SIX WEST GERMAN JOURNALIST OF CZECH ORIGIN 
THEY ARE ALL THE SAME MAN 
THIS MAN IN ONE NAME OR ANOTHER 
BEAUTIFUL I'D LIKE TO GIVE THE CZECH INTELLIGENCE OFFICER WHO THOUGHT THIS ONE UP AN OSCAR 
DAMN IT HARRY IT'S THE SAME OLD GAME IT'S GUILT BY COINCIDENCE 
COMPUTERISED COINCIDENCE 
HAS ANYONE ACTUALLY SEEN PYM 
CHIN WAGGING WITH THIS THREE IN ONE MYTH MAKER 
YOU MUST SEE OUR UNEASE HARRY 
ALL THIS IS THE SAME AS THE RADIO STUFF 
IF WE WERE GOING TO FRAME A MAN WE'D PLAY THE SAME GAME ON HIM 
GET THEM TO SHOOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT IT'S DEAD EASY IT'S A SET UP STICKS OUT A MILE 
IT'S AWFULLY TENUOUS BY THE BY YOU CHAPS HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING HIM WHEN HE'S BEEN OVER HERE HAVE YOU 
THAT WOULD BE GOING IT A BIT 
BO WE NEED A PIECE OF THIS 
IF IT'S A CZECH DECEPTION IT'S THE MOST INGENIOUS I'VE HEARD OF 
PYM IS A MOST INGENIOUS OFFICER 
BO YOU'VE GOT TO INTERROGATE THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF HIM 
HE'S FOOLED WITH OUR SECRETS TOO 
WE HAVE PEOPLE TRAINED TO QUESTION HIM 
HARRY YOU HAVE MY WORD THAT IF AND WHEN THE TIME IS RIPE YOU'LL HAVE AS MUCH OF HIM AS YOU WANT 
MAYBE THE MOMENT IS NOW 
MAYBE WE SHOULD BE THERE WHEN HE SINGS HIT HIM WHILE HE'S SOFT 
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRUST US ENOUGH TO BIDE YOUR TIME 
WELL GENTLEMEN WE SEEM TO HAVE COVERED THE GROUND

IT'S THE PSYCHOLOGY INVOLVED HERE 
PYM'S FATHER SIR I KNOW ABOUT THAT FATHER
