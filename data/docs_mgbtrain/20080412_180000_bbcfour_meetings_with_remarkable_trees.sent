ACROSS THE LAND OLD OFTEN ANCIENT YEWS CAN BE FOUND GRACING OUR CHURCHYARDS AND CEMETERIES 
LIKE THIS GRAND SPECIMEN AT MUCH MARCLE IN HEREFORDSHIRE 
BUT ARE THESE TREES ORNAMENTAL OR COULD THEIR PRESENCE AT THESE CHRISTIAN SITES BE MORE SINISTER 
THERE HAS LONG BEEN A LINK BETWEEN YEW TREES AND LIFE EVERLASTING 
PROBABLY BECAUSE THE TREES REACH A GREAT AGE 
AND BECAUSE THE EVERGREEN BRANCHES GIVE RISE TO THOUGHTS OF ETERNAL HEALTH AND LIFE 
FRAMING THE EASTERN DOORWAY TO THE CHURCH 
THIS TREE HAS PROVIDED THE CLERGY WITH A SHADY BACKDROP TO BOTH FESTIVAL AND FUNERAL 
FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAD TO TRIM AS I CALLED THEM WHISKERS ON THE TREES 
BECAUSE THEY GOT IN THE WAY OF COFFINS PASSING DOWN THE PATH 
THE YEW TREE HAS LONG BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH BURIAL 
IN TIMES PAST CASKETS WOULD OFTEN BE ADORNED WITH YEW WREATHS 
MOURNERS WOULD CARRY YEW BRANCHES TO BE PLACED IN THE GRAVES 
AND THE DEAD WOULD BE WRAPPED IN YEW FILLED SHROUDS 
IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR A BOTANIST ROBERT TURNER SUGGESTED THAT THE CHURCHYARD YEW'S MAIN FUNCTION 
WAS TO ATTRACT PUTREFACTION AND GROSS VAPOURS EXHALED FROM THE GRAVES BY THE SETTING SUN 
BUT BURIAL TOO CLOSE TO THE TREE IS NOT TO BE RECOMMENDED 
THERE CAN BE NO BURIALS AROUND THE TREE BECAUSE OF THE ROOTS WHICH PENETRATE VERY FAR UNDERGROUND 
AND IT WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT EVEN WITH MODERN MECHANICAL SHOVELS 
TO DIG THROUGH THAT AREA NOW 
WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME THE TREE HAS NATURALLY HOLLOWED 
WITH PARISHIONERS PUTTING THE INSIDE OF THE TREE TO VERY GOOD USE 
THERE IS THE CHURCH WARDEN'S RECORD BOOK OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
AND IT IS RECORDED THAT A SEAT WAS PLACED IN THE TREE FOR THE PRINCELY SUM OF SIXPENCE 
YEW TREES ARE OFTEN A PLACE OF SHELTER 
HOLLOW ONES LIKE THIS YOU CAN ACTUALLY STAND OR SIT INSIDE 
THIS ONE'S GONE SOME LOCAL PEOPLE HAVE MADE A BENCH OUT OF OAK 
THEY'VE GOT LEGS MADE OUT OF LONG LASTING YEW WOOD 
IT'S A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE MET PERHAPS SECRETLY AT NIGHT FOR A TRYST 
I REMEMBER THREE WELL RESPECTED OLD LADIES WHO CAME TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY MORNINGS 
THEY'D WALK THROUGH THE PARK SIT IN THE TREE TAKE OFF THEIR WELLINGTONS PUT RESPECTABLE SHOES ON FOR CHURCH 
AND THEN AT THE END OF THE SERVICE THEY WOULD REVERSE THE PROCEDURE 
IN THE PAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS IT'S BEEN USED AS A PARISH NOTICEBOARD 
HERE YOU CAN SEE THE NAIL MARKS OF EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURY NAILS WHERE NOTICES WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT 
ALSO THE TREE WAS USED ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER WITH REALLY BRIGHT LIGHT FOR WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHS 
BUT USUALLY IT WAS TOO DARK 
HERE IN HEREFORDSHIRE A YEW'S ASSOCIATION WITH MATRIMONY GOES BACK MANY CENTURIES 
IF A GIRL PLACED A SPRIG OF YEW UNDER HER PILLOW PICKED FROM A CHURCHYARD SHE HAD NEVER VISITED 
THAT NIGHT SHE WOULD DREAM OF HER FUTURE HUSBAND 
THE YEW AT MUCH MARCLE CERTAINLY PREDATES THE SEVEN HUNDRED YEAR OLD CHURCH 
IN WHOSE GROUND IT GROWS AND STOOD WHEN A NEARBY MANOR HOUSE OWNED BY WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR WAS LIVED IN 
BUT AS WITH MANY ANCIENT HOLLOW TREES ITS EXACT AGE IS UNKNOWN 
WHEN LORD RUNCIE WAS ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY HE SENT A CERTIFICATE TO ME 
ESTIMATING THE TREE TO BE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
WHEN DATING A TREE YOU LOOK AT THE ANNUAL RINGS OF THE TREE 
OR YOU MIGHT DO SOME CARBON DATING OF MATERIAL FROM ABOUT HERE 
BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WOOD HAS DECAYED AND FALLEN AWAY 
SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WITH ANY GREAT ACCURACY 
RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTS TREES OF THIS SIZE ARE TWO THOUSAND TO THREE THOUSAND YEARS OLD 
QUITE A DIFFERENCE IN LENGTH OF TIME 
THE YEW TREE WAS CLEARLY PERCEIVED AS A POTENT FORCE IN PRE CHRISTIAN BRITAIN 
BUT WHETHER THE CHURCHES WERE BUILT TO EXORCISE EARLIER PAGAN WORSHIP IS A DIFFICULT QUESTION 
I KNOW NOTHING HISTORICALLY HERE OF PEOPLE DOING RITUAL DANCES 
OR WEARING SPRIGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT TREES WERE WORSHIPPED IN THE PAST 
AND THE FACT THAT CHURCHES WERE OFTEN BUILT NEAR YEW TREES 
SUGGESTS THAT CHRISTIANITY TOOK OVER PREVIOUS RELIGIOUS SITES WHERE THE TREE WAS WORSHIPPED 
FOLKLORE SURROUNDED THE CHURCHYARD YEW AND SOME OF THE STRANGER MYTHS ARE WELL DOCUMENTED 
NEVER TAKE ANY PART OF A CHURCHYARD YEW INDOORS 
PLANT A YEW AS A WINDBREAK AGAINST THE POWERS OF EVIL 
DOWSE WITH A YEW BRANCH TO FIND LOST PROPERTY 
AND CONDEMN YOUR ENEMIES WHILST HOLDING A YEW BRANCH IN YOUR LEFT HAND 
SHAKESPEARE REFERS TO THE YEW IN RICHARD THE SECOND HE SAYS ITS POISONED BRANCHES ARE DOUBLE FATAL 
HAMLET'S UNCLE POISONS THE KING WITH YEW JUICE 
AND THE WITCHES OF MACBETH ADD YEW SPRIGS TO THEIR CAULDRON TO ENSURE A POTENT BREW 
IN MUCH MARCLE THE SAGGING AND POISONOUS BRANCHES OF THE TREE ARE KEPT OFF THE GROUND 
WITH THE HELP OF STAVES AND POSTS 
IT WAS NECESSARY TO PUT THEM UP AND TO PUT THE CROSSBEAMS 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT TRIMMING THE BRANCHES OF A YEW TREE 
THEY DO OF COURSE STRETCH OUT FAR FURTHER THAN THEY DID 
BUT NOBODY WANTED TO RUIN THE TREE OR TO CURTAIL ITS GROWTH 
ON TWO OF ITS SIDES THE TREE IS SUPPORTED BY LAMPPOSTS 
NOWADAYS THEY ACT AS CRUTCHES FOR THE TREE'S HEAVY CANOPY 
WHILST WITHIN THE HEART GROWS STRONGER AND WIDER 
ITS DEEP SEATED ROOTS DEFYING ANYONE TO QUESTION ITS IMMORTALITY
