LITERALLY BILLIONS OF POUNDS A YEAR 
THOSE ARE BIG NUMBERS BUT DON'T BE PUT OFF BY THAT 
NO AUCTIONS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL AND THEY'RE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD 
ANYONE CAN DO IT ALL YOU NEED IS SOME CASH AND SOME CONFIDENCE 
THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PROPERTIES GOING TO AUCTION EACH YEAR 
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DANCE AROUND LIKE A BUTTERFLY TO FIND THE GOOD ONES 
SO HERE'S WHAT THE BUYERS DECIDE TO GO FOR ON TODAY'S SHOW 
IT'S BEEN A LAUNDRETTE AND A SHOP 
WHAT'S NEXT FOR THIS FORMER OFFICE IN DERBY CONVERSION MAYBE 
FLATS RESIDENTIAL WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE 
THIS DERELICT LONDON PROPERTY IS IN A STATE 
IT'S GOT A HOLE IN THE ROOF 
AND IT'S BEEN ISSUED WITH A DANGEROUS STRUCTURE NOTICE 
OH DEAR TIME IS RUNNING OUT 
AND IT'S ONLY THE LARGE LIVING ROOM IN THIS FLAT 
IN PLYMOUTH THAT SAVES THE DAY 
IF IT WASN'T OR THIS I'D SAY YUK WITH THIS NOT TOO BAD 
THESE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN SOLD AT AUCTION AND WE'LL FIND OUT 
WHO BOUGHT THEM AND WHAT THEY PAID WHEN THEY WENT UNDER THE HAMMER 
THERE ARE LOTS OF TERRACED HOUSES LIKE THIS FOR SALE IN DERBY 
BUT THAT IS A COMPLETE RED HERRING 
COS IT'S NOTHING LIKE THE PROPERTY THAT'S UP FOR AUCTION 
IT'S THAT AND FROM THE OUTSIDE I HAVE TO SAY 
I CAN'T GET MY HEAD ROUND IT WHAT IS IT 
WELL APPARENTLY IN PREVIOUS LIVES IT'S BEEN A CORNER SHOP IT'S BEEN OFFICES 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK INSIDE 
IT'S CERTAINLY AN UNUSUAL LOOKING BUILDING 
AND IT WENT TO AUCTION AT A GUIDE PRICE OF JUST FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND QUID 
WOAH 
MASSIVELY HIGH CEILINGS LOOK AT THAT 
MUST BE ABOUT FIFTEEN TWENTY FEET HIGH 
HOW BIZARRE BUT I MEAN THIS IS THE FIRST ROOM YOU WALK INTO 
THESE HUGE GREAT WINDOWS HERE 
AGAIN YOU GET THIS FEELING OF WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST 
BUT A VERY UNUSUAL SPACE 
WHICH IS GOING TO NEED A BIT OF SORTING OUT 
SO NOT A BAD START BUT THEN IT GETS REALLY REALLY WEIRD 
WHEN YOU COME INTO THIS AREA 
OBVIOUSLY AT SOME POINT THIS WHOLE BUILDING HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO CREATE THESE OFFICES 
AS YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE DARK DINGY LITTLE HOLES A BIT STRANGE 
STAIRS GOING UP TO BASICALLY ATTIC STORAGE AND THAT'S IT BECAUSE 
THE HEAD HEIGHT ISN'T HIGH ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ELSE 
AND THEN ANOTHER OFFICE SPACE HERE 
SO IT THIS BIT JUST DOESN'T WORK BUT I GUESS IT'S GOT SCOPE 
AND WHAT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT HERE IS 
WHAT COULD YOU DO WITH THIS PROPERTY 
I'M IMMEDIATELY THINKING CONVERSION MAYBE 
FLATS RESIDENTIAL WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE 
ESPECIALLY AS IT'S SITUATED SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES 
BUT CONVERSION COULD PROVE A CHALLENGE 
THERE'S THAT CAVERNOUS OFFICE AND TWO SMALLER ONES 
WHICH LOOK AS THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN CONSTRUCTED 
USING JUST STUD PARTITIONS 
MIND YOU THE CORRIDOR IS BRIGHT AND LETS IN LOTS OF LIGHT 
AND THE ACCOMMODATION CONTINUES 
FAR END OF THE PROPERTY YET MORE SPACE 
BUT MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT THIS 
BECAUSE IT'S A SECOND DOOR INTO THE PROPERTY 
IT'S ON THE PAVEMENT AND IF YOU ARE THINKING OF CONVERTING THIS 
SAY INTO TWO FLATS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES YOU'LL HAVE IN TERMS OF PLANNING IS ACCESS 
GREAT IT'S ALREADY THERE SO THEY CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT 
BIG TICK IN THE BOX THE ROOM ITSELF WELL A GOOD SIZE SPACE 
SLIGHTLY SMALLER LOWER CEILINGS THAN OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING 
BUT STILL QUITE REASONABLE 
SOME KIND OF AREA THERE BEEN USED AS A KITCHEN AT SOME POINT AND A LOO THERE 
YOU HAVE FACILITIES YOU'VE GOT SEWERAGE YOU'VE GOT WATER ELECTRICITY 
IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT CONVERTING TO FLATS 
SOMETHING WHICH PEOPLE OFTEN FORGET 
SO ALL IN ALL THE PLACE HAS GREAT SCOPE 
WHAT IT NEEDS IS A BIT OF IMAGINATION 
APART FROM GETTING PLANNING CONSENT THE MAIN PROBLEM 
WITH CONVERTING THIS TO RESIDENTIAL IS THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF OUTSIDE SPACE 
THERE'S JUST A TINY INNER YARD 
TO TRY AND FLUSH OUT THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS QUIRKY 
CORNER PROPERTY I'VE INVITED ALONG THE AUCTIONEER WHO SOLD IT ON THE DAY 
THIS SINGLE STORIED BUILDING IS SURROUNDED 
BY TERRACED HOUSES AND FLATS BUT IS THAT AN ADVANTAGE OR NOT 
WHERE WE ARE HERE IN LINTON STREET 
WE ARE WITHIN A MILE OF THE CITY CENTRE 
IT TENDS TO BE MAINLY OLDER STYLE TERRACED HOUSING 
A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN USED AS STUDENT ACCOMMODATION 
THAT HAS FADED TO SOME EXTENT BECAUSE THE MARKET IS SATURATED 
AND THE UNIVERSITY'S BUILT A LOT OF ITS OWN HALLS OF RESIDENCE 
BUT THE AREA'S QUITE POPULAR FOR RENTED ACCOMMODATION 
FOR FIRST TIME BUYERS UM QUITE HANDY 
AND GRAHAM SHOULD KNOW IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME HE'S SOLD THIS PLACE 
I THINK IN THE INITIAL PERIOD IT WAS USED AS A CO OP SHOP 
THAT WAS THEN CLOSED IT THEN BECAME A LAUNDRETTE 
I DIDN'T SELL IT WHEN IT WAS A REDUNDANT SHOP BUT I DID WHEN IT WAS A REDUNDANT LAUNDRETTE 
THIS IS PROBABLY THE THIRD OR THE FOURTH TIME THAT I'VE ACTUALLY SOLD IT 
SO WHAT NEXT FOR THIS PROPERTY 
COULD WE SEE ANOTHER LAUNDRETTE OR EVEN A TRENDY COFFEE SHOP PERHAPS 
SOMEBODY MIGHT WANT TO USE IT FOR SOMETHING 
AKIN TO ITS PREVIOUS USE 
AS EITHER A SHOWROOM WITH AN OFFICE OR JUST OFFICES IN ITSELF 
BUT LOCATIONALLY FOR THAT PURPOSE IT ISN'T PARTICULARLY GOOD 
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY ONSITE PARKING AND YOU HAVE RESTRICTED PARKING ON STREET 
I THINK FOR THAT PURPOSE IT'LL BE DIFFICULT 
WELL IT'S NEVER BEEN USED AS A HOME 
COULD THAT BE THE NEXT CHAPTER 
A COUPLE OF FLATS MAYBE 
YOU'D HAVE TO GET CHANGE OF USE FROM COMMERCIAL TO RESIDENTIAL 
BUT COULD YOU FIND TENANTS 
I THINK THE PLANNING AUTHORITY WOULD LOOK KINDLY ON RESIDENTIAL ALTERNATIVE 
IT'S A RESIDENTIAL AREA BASICALLY 
AND THEREFORE THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE ITS OBVIOUS USE 
IF YOU HAD TWO ONE BEDROOM UNITS HERE I DON'T THINK THEY'D TAKE A LOT OF LETTING 
I SUPPOSE WE'RE TALKING TYPICALLY OF SOMETHING LIKE SEVENTY FIVE EIGHTY A WEEK 
IF YOU RETAIN IT AS IT IS AND TRY AND SELL IT AS BUSINESS PREMISES 
I DON'T THINK YOU'D GET MORE THAN EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR IT 
IF YOU MAKE IT INTO RESIDENTIAL ACCOMMODATION 
BUT RENT IT IT WOULD BE WORTH ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
SO CONVERSION TO RESIDENTIAL USE SEEMS TO BE THE BEST BET FOR THIS PLACE 
SO A PROPERTY THAT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN THROUGH SOME CHANGES OVER THE YEARS 
WHAT DOES THE NEXT PHASE HOLD 
LET'S FIND OUT WHO BOUGHT IT AT THE AUCTION 
LOT FORTY FIVE IS NUMBER TWO LINTON STREET IN DERBY 
IT'S AN ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL AREA NUMBER TWO LINTON STREET 
HOW MUCH CAN I SAY FOR THIS ONE 
START ME ON THIS AT SIXTY TWO 
SIXTY TWO SIXTY THOUSAND

EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND STANDING AT THE BACK 
AT EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND WE'RE GOING TO SELL 
EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND ONCE TWICE THIRD AND LAST TIME ON LINTON STREET AT EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND 
SOLD AT EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND THANK YOU 
LOCAL MAN PETE MADE THE FINAL BID OF EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND 
HE'S AN AMBULANCE DRIVER AND BOUGHT THE CORNER OFFICE AS AN INVESTMENT 
PETE'S NEW TO PROPERTY DEVELOPING 
THIS IS HIS FIRST VENTURE AND HE'S HOPING TO BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO THIS CORNER PLOT 
PETE NICE TO MEET YOU HELLO HI 
JUST TELL ME WHY YOU WANTED TO BUY THIS PLACE 
WELL ORIGINALLY I COME BY THIS PLACE BY CHANCE 
WE WERE GOING TO BUY A HAIRDRESSERS 
IN STOKE WE'D SEEN IN THE AUCTION CATALOGUE 
I THOUGHT I'D GO AN VIEW IT FIRST 
THE DAY I WENT IT WAS RAINING QUITE A LOT 
AND THE WHOLE ROOF WAS COMING THROUGH WITH WATER 
SO THAT WAS A NO GO 
HOW LUCKY YOU WENT WHEN IT WAS RAINING 
WE CAME BACK AND I LOOKED THROUGH THE CATALOGUE AND I SEEN THIS PROPERTY 
CAME TO VIEW IT AND I THOUGHT I'D MAKE A BID FOR IT 
SO PETE HADN'T ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO BUY THIS PROPERTY AT ALL 
BUT THANKS TO HIS RAINY DAY OUT 
HE'S DECIDED TO DIP HIS TOE IN THE WATER 
IF HE HAD BOUGHT THE HAIRDRESSERS 
HE WOULD HAVE USED IT AS AN INVESTMENT AS PREMISES TO LET OUT 
NOT SOMEWHERE TO WORK HIMSELF 
PETE'S JOB IS FAR REMOVED FROM CUTTING HAIR 
WELL I WORK FOR THE AMBULANCE SERVICE 
OH GREAT ON THE FRONT LINE IN EMERGENCY REALLY YEAH OH WOW O. K. 
I'VE BEEN DOING THAT JOB NOW FOR ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS SO I WAS JUST 
I WAS AT A STAGE NOW WHERE I WAS LOOKING TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT 
JUST FOR THE FUTURE 
YOU'RE CARRYING ON WITH YOUR JOB AS AN AMBULANCE 
OH YEAH I WOULDN'T GIVE MY JOB UP I LOVE MY JOB SO 
DO YOU DRIVE THE AMBULANCES 
YEAH AND ALL THE BLUES AND TWOS ON REALLY 
WE TAKE IT IN TURNS DRIVING OR ATTENDING GREAT 
WHY THIS PLACE 
I CAME DOWN TO VIEW IT AND THEN STRAIGHT AWAY IN MY MIND 
I HAD A PICTURE OF CONVERTING IT INTO TWO SELF CONTAINED FLATS 
IS THIS YOUR FIRST DEVELOPMENT 
CONVERTING A PROPERTY INTO TWO FLATS IS NEW TO ME AND IT'S SOMETHING I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO 
IT'S QUITE AN AMBITIOUS ONE TO START WITH THEN 
YEAH YOU COULD SAY THAT BUT YOU'VE GOT TO AIM HIGH 
DEAD RIGHT BUT THESE LOFTY CEILINGS COULD PROVE A CHALLENGE 
PETE COULD NEED EXTRA MONEY TO COVER THAT WORK 
HOW MUCH HAS HE SET ASIDE 
WELL I'VE BOUGHT THE PROPERTY FOR EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND 
I HAD A LIMIT OF EIGHTY WHERE I WAS GOING TO BID TO 
AND I WENT THE EXTRA ONE AND I GOT THE PROPERTY WHICH I WAS PLEASED ABOUT 
I'M LOOKING TO SPEND ROUGHLY ABOUT TEN THOUSAND ON EACH FLAT 
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO SPEND JUST OVER 
WHAT ABOUT TIME SCALES FOR EVERYTHING 
PLANNING PERMISSION TAKES ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS 
I'LL BE GIVING PLANS TO BUILDERS TO GET QUOTES 
AND HOPEFULLY IF THEY DO GET PASSED I'LL GET THE BUILDERS IN STRAIGHT AWAY 
HOW LONG WILL THE CONVERSION TAKE 
I'D BE LOOKING ABOUT FOUR WEEKS OH QUITE QUICK 
THAT'S RIGHT I'M INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT THE SORT OF PLANS YOU HAVE 
CAN WE WANDER ROUND 
COURSE WE CAN YOU CAN SHOW ME YEAH GO ON AFTER YOU 
YEAH AS WE WALK THROUGH HERE THIS IS GOING TO BE THE SECOND FLAT 
O. K. WHERE YOU'VE GOT THE KITCHEN AND THE EN SUITE 
AND THE BEDROOM THROUGH THERE RIGHT 
AND MAKE A CORRIDOR HERE 
THIS WILL BE THE LOUNGE AS YOU COME THROUGH HERE THIS'LL BE THE LOUNGE 
THERE'LL BE A PARTITION WALL SAY ABOUT HERE 
TO DIVIDE BOTH OF THE FLATS O. K. 
THIS WILL BE FLAT NUMBER ONE YOU'VE GOT THE LOUNGE AS YOU COME IN 
THEN WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AN L. SHAPE FOR THE KITCHEN INTO THAT ROOM THERE 
AND AN EN SUITE FOR THE BIT WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE BEDROOM HERE 
WHAT ABOUT THE CEILING HEIGHT 
COS IT'S GOT THESE HUGE CEILINGS 
WELL I'M HOPING TO BRING THE CEILINGS DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF THE BEDROOMS 
OF THAT BEDROOM THERE MAKE IT THE SAME HEIGHT 
CREATE A LOFT SPACE 
MAKE SOME STORAGE SPACE AT THE TOP WHICH THERE IS AT THE MOMENT 
JUST MAKE IT BIGGER THESE STAIRS WILL COME OUT 
AND THIS WILL BECOME THE BEDROOM 
SO NOT REALLY NOT THAT MUCH MAJOR STRUCTURAL WORK NEEDED 
NOT REALLY COS IF YOU LOOK AT THE WALLS 
THEY'RE ALL PLYWOOD AND THEY'RE EASY TO TAKE DOWN AND REARRANGE 
ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT TAKING ALL THIS ON I AM 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING IT STARTED 
AND PUTTING MY PLANS IN ACTION AND SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW IT TURNS OUT 
THANK YOU GOOD LUCK WITH IT ALL 
WHAT AN INTERESTING SHAPED BUILDING TO TACKLE ON YOUR FIRST REDEVELOPMENT 
CONVERTING THIS INTO TWO FLATS IS CERTAINLY GOING TO TAKE SOME THOUGHT 
SO WILL AMBULANCE MAN PETE MANAGE TO RESUSCITATE THIS BUILDING 
WELL HE'S GOT QUITE A JOB AHEAD 
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S SET HIMSELF ENOUGH BUDGET 
WITH THAT TEN THOUSAND PER FLAT THAT HE HAS IN MIND 
WELL FIRST STEP OF COURSE IS TO GET HIS PLANNING PERMISSION 
YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW HE GETS ON LATER IN THE PROGRAMME 
I'M IN ROEHAMPTON IN SOUTHWEST LONDON 
IT'S MOST FAMOUS FOR ITS MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES 
ATTRACTING OVER EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS TO THE AREA 
AND WHERE THERE ARE STUDENTS THERE'S USUALLY POTENTIAL 
BUT I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF YOU COULD GET STUDENTS TO LIVE 
IN THIS AUCTION PROPERTY 
I MEAN LOOK AT THE STATE OF IT 
I KNOW IT WAS ONCE A HOUSE AND NOW IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN AN OLD SHACK 
AND IT'S BEEN ISSUED WITH A DANGEROUS STRUCTURE NOTICE 
OH DEAR TIME IS RUNNING OUT 
EVEN WITH ALL THE MEDICAL STUDENTS AROUND HERE 
I DOUBT THAT ANYONE COULD GIVE THIS OLD BUILDING THE KISS OF LIFE 
IT'S FALLING DOWN IN FACT IT'S SO DANGEROUS WE CAN'T SET FOOT IN IT 
WHICH IS A SHAME AS I'D LOVE TO SEE WHAT FEATURES STILL EXIST 
ORIGINALLY THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOVELY OLD COACH HOUSE 
LOOK AT THAT BEAUTIFUL BAY WINDOW 
AND I KNOW UP UNTIL RECENTLY SOMEBODY WAS LIVING HERE 
YOU CAN'T SEE MUCH OF THE BUILDING THE PLOT GOES RIGHT BACK 
THERE'S SOME OUTBUILDINGS ATTACHED AND FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR OWN HOME 
YOU MAY THINK YOU COULD JUST COME ALONG AND RENOVATE THIS 
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE 
THIS HOUSE ISN'T LISTED IT'S OF NO HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE 
AND BECAUSE IT'S HAD A DANGEROUS STRUCTURE NOTICE SLAPPED ON IT 
THE ONLY OPTION IS TO KNOCK IT DOWN AND START AGAIN 
SO IN EFFECT THIS LOT IS JUST A PLOT OF LAND 
THAT WILL MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE TO DEVELOPERS AS THEY COULD BUILD ANYTHING 
FROM A BLOCK OF FLATS SOME SEMIS EVEN OFFICE OR RETAIL UNITS HERE 
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS 
IT IS EASY TO GET CARRIED AWAY WITH ALL THESE IDEAS 
BUT FROM A PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW I CAN SEE ONE MAJOR DRAWBACK 
THIS IS THE ONLY ACCESS TO THE SITE AT THE BACK 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET DIGGERS AND SKIPS AND ALL THE TOOLS 
THAT THE WORKMEN NEED TO DEVELOP THE SITE 
I'VE BEEN HAVING A DIG AROUND I'VE CHATTED TO LOCALS 
AND I'VE FOUND OUT THIS SHOP HERE THAT'S IN FRONT 
HAS BEEN EMPTY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS 
WHOEVER BUYS THIS PROPERTY AT AUCTION SHOULD DEFINITELY TRY 
AND LOCATE THE OWNER OF THIS SHOP AND MAKE THEM AN OFFER 
UNTILL ACCESS IS RESOLVED 
WHOEVER BUYS THIS PROPERTY IS GOING TO HAVE THEIR AMBITIONS LIMITED 
BUT THE LOCAL ESTATE AGENT THINKS THERE'S POTENTIAL HERE 
AND IT'S THE PUB NEXT DOOR THAT HOLDS THE KEY 
THE SURROUNDING BUILDINGS HERE 
YOU'RE SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO PUBS 
WHICH MOST PEOPLE MIGHT THINK WOULD BE IDEAL 
IN FACT ONE IS OBVIOUSLY THRIVING THE OTHER ONE IS CLOSED DOWN 
AND IN FACT I'VE FOUND OUT IS THE SUBJECT OF A PLANNING APPLICATION 
THERE'S A PROPOSAL TO BUILD ABOUT TWELVE OR THIRTEEN UNITS HERE 
BUT THE PUB DATES BACK SOME THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS 
SO IT'S A GRADE THE SECOND LISTED BUILDING SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO SORT OUT THAT PLANNING 
NOW WHOEVER BUYS THIS MAY WELL BENEFIT FROM THAT 
HE MAY BE ABLE TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT AH THE PUB 
AND MAY BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE WITHIN HIS SCHEME 
SOMETHING FROM THEIR DEVELOPMENT 
AND IT MIGHT EVEN BE THAT HE CAN FIND BETTER ACCESS THAN HE'S GOT ALREADY 
SO THAT MIGHT BE THE SECRET THAT UNLOCKS IT FOR HIM 
IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA AND ONE WORTH CONSIDERING 
BUT JUST WHAT SORT OF DEVELOPMENT WOULD THE COUNCIL LIKE TO SEE HERE 
I THINK THE POTENTIAL FOR A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IS RESTRICTED 
IT WOULD HELP IF I COULD SEE INSIDE AND SEE THE WHOLE SITE 
I VERY MUCH DOUBT THAT YOU COULD BUILD MANY UNITS 
I THINK IT'S PRIMARILY AS ONE UNIT 
YOU MIGHT GET PERMISSION FOR TWO OR THREE FLATS BUT I THINK COMMERCIALLY 
IT WOULD WORK MUCH BETTER AS ONE UNIT ONE HOUSE OR PART HOUSE PART COMMERCIAL 
THERE ARE SO MANY OPTIONS WITH THIS LOT 
WILL IT BE TORN DOWN AND A NEW DEVELOPMENT PUT IN ITS PLACE 
OR WILL A DEVELOPER BUY IT FOR COMMERCIAL USE 
IT'S ALL TO PLAY FOR IN THE AUCTION ROOM 
RIGHT ROEHAMPTON HERE WE COME 
LOT FIFTY FIVE 
IT'S AN UNUSUAL BUILDING I THINK 
YOU LOOK AT THE SITE IT'S GOT INTERESTING POTENTIAL

WOW WHAT A NAIL BITING AUCTION 
THE BIDS KEPT COMING BUT FOR TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THE NEW OWNER OF THIS CONDEMNED PROPERTY IS LOCAL VET RICHARD 
RICHARD'S NEW PROPERTY IS ONLY BARKING DISTANCE FROM HIS VETERINARY PRACTICE 
I SQUEEZED IN SOME TIME BETWEEN HIS APPOINTMENTS TO FIND OUT HIS PLANS 
RICHARD YOU'VE GOT A FANTASTIC JOB I WANT TO KNOW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT YOU 
YEAH I DO HAVE A GREAT JOB 
I'M INCREDIBLY LUCKY LIKE THAT 
I'VE GOT A JOB IN WHICH YOU KNOW 
I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE BOTH TO PEOPLE'S LIVES AND TO ANIMALS' LIVES 
I CAN FEEL LIKE AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN I GO HOME 
I CAN REALLY FEEL LIKE I'VE DONE SOMETHING WORTHWHILE 
NOWADAYS IT'S A PRETTY RARE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THAT SORT OF JOB 
HOW DO YOU JUGGLE WORK WITH YOUR FAMILY LIFE 
IT'S DIFFICULT I MEAN IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME BEING A VET 
I'M HERE EIGHT IN THE MORNING TILL EIGHT AT NIGHT FIVE DAYS A WEEK 
THEN SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS AS WELL 
AND MY LITTLE BOYS I'VE GOT TWINS TWIN BOYS THERE HOW OLD ARE THEY 
NINE YEARS OLD AND THEY'RE ALWAYS COMPLAINING THAT I'M NEVER AROUND ENOUGH AND 
RICHARD OBVIOUSLY WORKS VERY HARD 
AND IS AN IMPORTANT MEMBER OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY 
NOT ONLY CURING POORLY PETS BUT DEALING WITH UPSET OWNERS TOO 
BUT DO HIS SKILLS RUN TO RESCUING OLD BUILDINGS 
WHY DID YOU WANT TO BUY THAT DILAPIDATED BUILDING 
THERE'S A LOT WRONG WITH IT SURELY YOU CAN SEE THAT 
WELL I THINK THAT'S THE KEY THING IS THAT THIS BUILDING 
IT'S HAD IT'S DAY IT'S BEEN A NICE HOUSE IN ITS TIME 
BUT THE COUNCIL HAVE INSISTED THAT THEY WANT IT DEMOLISHED 
THAT'S KEY TO MY PLANS ON THAT BUILDING 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD THERE 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TRANSFER THE HOSPITAL HERE OVER THERE 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS ACTUALLY BUILD 
A DEDICATED VETERINARY HOSPITAL FROM SCRATCH 
SO THAT WE CAN DESIGN EVERYTHING RIGHT FROM THE START 
EXACTLY THE WAY THAT WE WANTED 
SO THAT WE CAN OPTIMISE THE CARE AND THE FACILITIES 
THAT WE CAN GIVE OUR ANIMALS 
WE HOPE THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE A TOTALLY 
DEDICATED VETERINARY HOSPITAL 
THE BUILDING THAT RICHARD CURRENTLY WORKS FROM 
USED TO BE A PUBLIC CONVENIENCE OF ALL THINGS AND RICHARD CONVERTED IT HIMSELF 
NOW IT'S ALL GETTING A BIT CRAMPED AS HIS PRACTICE EXPANDS 
TO KEEP UP WITH MEDICAL ADVANCES IN ANIMAL SURGERY 
HE NEEDS MORE SPACE SO THIS PLOT OF LAND PROVIDES JUST THAT 
IT'S GOING TO BE BIGGER AND BETTER 
WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT MORE SPACE TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK 
THAT WE NEED TO DO 
THE TECHNOLOGY'S IMPROVING ALL THE TIME WE'RE HAVING TO BRING IN NEW EQUIPMENT ALL THE TIME 
WE'RE PIONEERING IN THIS COUNTRY DOING KEYHOLE SURGERY LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY 
AND PEOPLE REALLY LIKE 
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THEIR ANIMALS CUT OPEN 
AND WE CAN DO IT THROUGH THESE TINY LITTLE INCISIONS 
HAVE EVERYTHING MAGNIFIED 
NOT ONLY IS IT BETTER FOR THE DOG BUT IT'S BETTER FOR US AS WELL 
BECAUSE WE CAN SEE WITH MUCH GREATER DETAIL AND PRECISION 
WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING AND THEREBY GIVE A BETTER SERVICE ALL AROUND 
THERE'S ONE THING THAT WORRIES ME AND IT'S THE ACCESS 
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF RENOVATING THIS BUILDING 
I'VE THOUGHT A LOT THROUGH AND IT IS A BIG PROBLEM 
ACCESS TO THIS PARTICULAR SITE 
AND A LOT OF THAT IS DEPENDENT ON WHETHER I'M SUCCESSFUL OR NOT 
AT BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE THIS SMALL SHOP THAT'S HERE 
THAT SHOP'S BEEN EMPTY FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS 
AND THERE ARE MANY PLACES IN ROEHAMPTON'S HIGH STREET THAT ARE EMPTY 
SO IT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF VALUE AS AN ACTUAL SHOP 
BUT THE MAN WHO OWNS THAT DOES WANT 
TO GET AS MUCH MONEY AS HE CAN FOR THAT SO THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR ME AND THIS PROJECT 
UNDERSTANDABLY HE WANTS TO MAXIMISE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT HE GETS 
AT THIS STAGE HE WON'T GIVE ME AN ANSWER 
AS TO HOW MUCH HE WANTS FOR IT SO THAT'S FAIRLY PROBLEMATIC 
SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS THAT I'VE HAD SURVEYORS COME TO LOOK AT THIS 
AND TO GIVE ME A VALUE OF WHAT IT'S WORTH ON THE MARKET AT THIS POINT 
THAT'S GOING TO BE MY STARTING POINT 
I'VE WRITTEN TO HIM MADE THE OFFER AND THEN WE SEE WHAT'S WILL HAPPEN 
APART FROM THE EASE OF ACCESS TO THE SITE 
RICHARD'S KEEN TO ACQUIRE THIS SHOP AS A CAR PARK FOR HIS CLIENTS 
HE HAS A BUDGET OF AROUND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT 
THAT INCLUDES EQUIPMENT FOR THE HOSPITAL 
X. RAY MACHINES DON'T COME CHEAP 
THE BUILDINGS COST WOULD BE REDUCED IF HE COULD GET BETTER ACCESS 
SO WHAT'S THIS BUILDING GOING TO LOOK LIKE HOW'S IT GOING TO SIT 
WHAT I WANT IS I WANT TO HAVE A BUILDING THAT EXPRESSES THE QUALITY OF THE WORK THAT WE DO 
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AND WELL BUILT BUILDING HERE 
WE WANT TO INCORPORATE AS MUCH LIGHT AS POSSIBLE 
THAT CAN COME INTO THIS BUILDING 
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THE BUILDING IN A FAIRLY TRADITIONAL STYLE 
TO KEEP IN HARMONY WITH THE LOCAL AREA 
RICHARD PLAYS A HUGE PART IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY 
EVERY DAY HE'S RELIED ON TO CURE PEOPLE'S POORLY PETS 
BUT CAN HE SAVE THIS BEAST OF A BUILDING 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I BET HE CAN 
COMING UP IN PLYMOUTH AM I WEARING ROSE TINTED GLASSES 
WITH A BIT OF IMAGINATION WHITEWASH THE WALLS IT COULD ACTUALLY BE QUITE NICE 
WE RETURN TO LONDON TO FIND OUT IF THE ANIMAL HOSPITAL OPENED ON TIME 
THE PRACTICE IS KIND OF BURSTING AT THE SEAMS 
AND WE CAN'T REALLY FIT ANY MORE IN 
IN DERBY THERE WAS A DIFFERENT CASUALTY NEEDING EMERGENCY TREATMENT 
WHAT IT WAS TO WHAT IT IS NOW IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND I REALLY ENJOYED THAT 
WHEN I WAS LAST IN DERBY 
AMBULANCE DRIVER PETE HAD JUST BOUGHT THIS UNUSUAL CORNER PLOT FOR EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND 
IT WAS HIS FIRST VENTURE INTO PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT 
AND HE PLANNED TO CONVERT IT INTO TWO FLATS 
SEVEN MONTHS LATER ON THE OUTSIDE THE BLOOD RED COLOUR HAS DISAPPEARED 
AND THE PATIENT SEEMS TO BE RECOVERING 
INSIDE THERE'S SMALLER WINDOWS 
LAMINATE FLOORING AND LOWER CEILINGS MAKE IT FEEL MUCH MORE RESIDENTIAL 
PETE'S SQUEEZED IN A KITCHEN 
BUT IT'S NARROW AND IT WOULD BE A TIGHT FIT TO COOK ANYTHING 
DOWN THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING WHERE THE OFFICES WERE 
THE LONG CORRIDORS HAVE GONE PLUS THOSE MULTI COLOURED OFFICES 
AT THE BACK OF THE PROPERTY THE REAR STOREROOM NOW FORMS 
PART OF THE SECOND FLAT 
WITH ANOTHER KITCHEN 
A TRICKY PROJECT FOR PETE'S FIRST DEVELOPMENT 
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S BREATHED NEW LIFE INTO THE PLACE 
THIS USED TO BE THE OLD RECEPTION AREA 
OF THE OLD PLACE WHICH USED TO BE A BUSINESS PREMISES 
HERE I'VE LOWERED THE CEILINGS AND I'VE PUT ALL NEW WINDOWS IN 
THIS IS A LOUNGE AND I'VE KEPT AN OPEN PLAN KITCHEN 
WITH THE LOUNGE SO WE COOK THROUGH THERE 
THROUGH THERE IS THE BEDROOM WITH THE EN SUITE 
IN THIS ROOM WE'VE MADE A GOOD SIZE BEDROOM WHERE WE HAD 
THE CORRIDOR OVER HERE AND WE HAD A OLD OFFICE IN HERE WITH A STUDDED WALL 
WE'VE KNOCKED THE WALL THROUGH BROUGHT THE CEILINGS DOWN 
WHICH HAS FORMED A GOOD SIZE BEDROOM WITH THE EN SUITE 
PETE'S REPLACED THE LARGE WINDOWS DOWN THE SIDE OF THE PROPERTY 
WITH SMALLER DOUBLE GLAZED UNITS AND TWO NEW FRONT DOORS 
THE BUILDING'S NOW COMPLETELY DIVIDED AND THE SECOND FLAT HAS ITS OWN ENTRANCE 
HERE WE ARE THIS IS FLAT NUMBER TWO 
THE DOOR BEHIND ME WAS ALREADY THERE WITH THE ORIGINAL BUILDING 
SO IT MADE IT EASY ACCESS FOR US 
AND MADE THE PLANNING PERMISSION EASY FOR BOTH FLATS 
THIS IS A LARGER FLAT 
IT'S GOT A LARGE BEDROOM ONTHE RIGHT 
WITH A SEPARATE KITCHEN AND THE SHOWER ROOM IN THE CORNER 
THAT LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA SPACE MAKES QUITE A DIFFERENCE 
THE BATHROOM IS MORE ACCESSIBLE 
AND THE KITCHEN IS MORE OF A NARROW GALLEY STYLE AS IT IS IN FLAT ONE 
PETE WORKS SHIFTS WITH THE AMBULANCE CREW 
SO DID THAT LEAVE HIM MUCH SPARE TIME TO COME AND HELP THE BUILDERS 
I MEAN ON MY DAYS OFF I'D POP IN AND SEE HOW THE WORK WAS GOING 
IF WAS MY DAY OFF I'D POP IN DELIBERATELY ON DINNER TIME 
AND I'D GET 'EM FISH AND CHIPS OR SOME SANDWICHES 
THAT REALLY PLEASED THEM BECAUSE TO ME A GOOD WORKFORCE IS A HAPPY WORKFORCE 
WELL DRIP FEEDING THE BUILDERS WITH BUTTIES SEEMS TO HAVE PAID OFF 
PETE'S PAID EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND AT AUCTION FOR THE CORNER PROPERTY 
HE'S NEEDED SEPARATE ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES FOR BOTH FLATS 
AND HAS HAD A LOT OF WORK DONE 
SO HAVE HIS FINANCES BEEN HAEMORRHAGING 
WELL MY BUDGET ORIGINALLY I WAS GOING TO SPEND TEN THOUSAND ON EACH FLAT 
BUT THAT WENT OUT THE WINDOW 
I THINK THE BUDGET JUST DOUBLED SO ROUGHLY I'VE SPENT ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND ON EACH FLAT 
BECAUSE I DID WANT THEM TO A HIGH STANDARD 
I THINK I'VE ACHIEVED THAT 
WELL THE FLATS ARE NEARLY COMPLETE SO WHAT'S THE PLAN RENT OUT OR SELL 
WELL I'M IN TWO MINDS WHETHER TO RENT THEM OUT 
OR WHETHER TO SELL THE PROPERTY YOU KNOW 
I'VE HAD A LOT OF INTEREST FROM PEOPLE WHO WANT TO RENT 
THEY'VE BEEN POPPING IN AND YOU KNOW ASKING 
PETE'S DECISION ON WHETHER TO RENT OR SELL WILL DEPEND ON THE PRICE 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT TWO LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS THINK THE TWO FLATS COULD BE WORTH 
THE SPACE THAT'S BEEN CREATED WITHIN THE TWO FLATS ACTUALLY IS QUITE GOOD 
IT WAS NEVER LARGE 
BUT TO GET TWO SEPARATE UNITS OUT OF IT 
WITH SEPARATE BEDROOMS 
IT'S BEEN QUITE A GOOD WELL DONE SCHEME 
FROM THE INTERNAL SPACE THAT THE OWNER HAD 
I THINK THE LAYOUT WORKS AS WELL AS IT POSSIBLY COULD 
THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW COMPROMISES 
AND NEW PEOPLE COMING IN HERE SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH IT 
I THINK THEY COULD HAVE DONE SLIGHTLY BETTER WITH THE MATCH OF BRICK 
IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS WHERE THE NEW BRICKWORK IS SO MAYBE NOT A LOT OF THOUGHT'S GONE INTO THAT 
LIKE A CHEAP WIG YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE JOIN 
PETE PAID EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND AT AUCTION AND SPENT TWENTY THOUSAND ON EACH FLAT 
SO WITH THAT FORTY THOUSAND HE SPENT ON THE REFURBISHMENT 
THAT'S A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND AFTER SEVEN MONTHS 
HOW MUCH COULD EACH INDIVIDUAL FLAT BE WORTH ON THE OPEN MARKET 
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ROUND ABOUT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR THE SMALLER PROPERTY 
AND PERHAPS SIXTY SIX SIXTY SEVEN FOR THE SLIGHTLY LARGER ONE 
I THINK THERE'S A LIMITED MARKET FOR THEM 
THEREFORE PRICING HAS GOT TO BE QUITE KEY 
I THINK THE ASKING PRICE HAS NOT GOT TO EXCEED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
AND I THINK YOU MIGHT BE QUITE LUCKY TO ACHIEVE THAT 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
STILL NOT MUCH OVER THAT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND THAT PETE SPENT 
I'M THINKING ALONG THE LINES OF RENTING THEM OUT RATHER THAN SELLING THEM 
I THINK THEY'RE BETTER FOR A LONG TERM INVESTMENT 
O. K. NOW THAT PETE'S LOOKING TO GENERATE INCOME FROM 
RENTING THE FLATS HOW MUCH COULD HE POTENTIALLY GET 
I WOULD SAY ON THE RENTED MARKET THEY WOULD BE SOMEWHERE AROUND 
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE A CALENDAR MONTH FOR EACH 
IN TERMS OF RENTAL WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT ROUND ABOUT 
FOUR HUNDRED PER CALENDAR MONTH FOR EACH PROPERTY 
YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT'S BAD 
I THINK WE'D PROBABLY GET FOUR HUNDRED FOR EACH ONE AND MAYBE EVEN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOR THE BIGGER ONE 
THAT'S IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE I WAS THINKING 
SO PETE'S GOING TO HOLD ON TO HIS INVESTMENT AND LOOK FOR TENANTS 
HE TOOK ON A TOUGH CONVERSION FOR HIS FIRST DEVELOPMENT 
AND HE SHOULD BE VERY PLEASED 
WOULD HE DO IT AGAIN 
I'VE ENJOYED PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER WHERE IT'S COME FROM SCRATCH AND WHAT IT WAS 
IS TO WHAT IT IS NOW COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND I REALLY ENJOYED THAT 
LATER ON IN A COUPLE OF YEARS' TIME IF THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY CAME ALONG 
I WOULD MAKE THE SAME MOVE AGAIN 
IT SOUNDS LIKE PETE'S IN NO HURRY WITH PROPERTY DEVELOPING 
HE DOES ALL HIS RACING AROUND IN HIS DAY JOB 
WITH THAT AMBULANCE 
IT'S TIME TO HEAD FOR THE COAST AND ONE OF BRITAIN'S KEY PORTS 
TO MY MIND THERE'S NO MORE POWERFUL SYMBOL OF URBAN REGENERATION THAT THIS 
THE OLD BOMBED OUT WAR DAMAGED CHURCH IN THE FOREGROUND 
AND THE BRAND NEW SHOPPING CENTRE IN THE BACKGROUND 
THIS IS PLYMOUTH AND IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO INVEST 
THE CITY HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT BASE 
FOR THE ROYAL NAVY SINCE THE TIME OF SIR FRANCIS DRAKE 
THESE DAYS IT'S ALSO A MAJOR PORT OF CALL FOR STUDENTS 
THE CONTINUED INJECTION OF MONEY 
MEANS LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE FLOCKING HERE IN SEARCH OF ACCOMMODATION 
WELL PLYMOUTH CONTINUES TO GET A BIG TICK IN THE BUY TO LET RENTAL ARENA 
I'M NOT QUITE IN THE CENTRE OF PLYMOUTH BUT I'M NOT FAR AWAY 
UP FOR GRABS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE A PERFECT RENTAL MACHINE 
IT'S A ONE BEDROOM FIRST FLOOR FLAT 
GUIDE PRICE FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND QUID 
SO WHAT'S IT LIKE WELL A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTING START TO BE HONEST 
THE STAIRCASE VERY DARK VERY DINGY BUT A BIT OF GOOD NEWS 
ABOVE IT IS THIS SKYLIGHT WHICH LITERALLY GOES INTO THE LOFT 
THERE IS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING A BIT OF NATURAL LIGHT 
DOWN TO THIS LANDING AREA WHICH IS WHAT IT NEEDS 
SOMETHING THAT'S ALSO CURSED WITH DARKNESS IS THE KITCHEN AREA 
YOU CAN SEE DARK DINGY AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO TRY AND DO SOMETHING THERE 
OBVIOUSLY NEEDS COMPLETE REFURBISHMENT YOUR ONE BEDROOM 
NOW THANKFULLY THAT HAS GOT A REASONABLE SIZE WINDOW 
SO IT'S NOT TOO BAD 
BUT THE REDEEMING FEATURE FOR ME FOR THIS FLAT IS HERE THE LOUNGE IT'S HUGE 
GIVES A REALLY NICE SENSE OF SPACE 
YOU'D WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE FIREPLACE 
NEEDS REFURBISHING BUT YOU HAVE GOT BIG WINDOWS LOTS OF LIGHT 
IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS I'D SAY YUK 
WITH THIS NOT TOO BAD 
AND THE YUK IS RELATIVELY EASY TO REMOVE 
CARPETS AND FITTINGS ARE SIMPLE ENOUGH TO REPLACE 
BUT THE STATE OF THE WALLS WILL NEED A BIT MORE ATTENTION 
AND AS WELL AS BEING TINY 
THE BATHROOM IS CRAMMED WITH TOO MANY SIGNS OF DAYS LONG GONE 
AND THEN THERE'S THE GRIM ISSUE OF THE VIEW OUT BACK 
H. M. M. NOW IT'S A FIRST FLOOR FLAT 
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO EXPECT MUCH OF A GARDEN 
HOWEVER IN COMMON WITH A LOT OF THE PROPERTIES AROUND HERE 
WHAT YOU HAVE GOT IS A LITTLE COURTYARD DOWN HERE 
IT'S NOT MASSIVE BUT WITH A BIT OF IMAGINATION WHITEWASH THE WALLS 
STICK SOME POTS GET YOUR HERBS AND MAYBE EVEN A FEW VEGETABLES 
IT COULD ACTUALLY BE QUITE NICE 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S JUST A LITTLE BONUS 
IF YOU PEEK OVER THE FENCE YOU EVEN GET A VIEW OF THE BEAUTIFUL DEVON HILLS 
ER DEPENDING ON THE TRAFFIC THAT IS 
SO IT'S A BIT OF A MIXED BAG 
AND THE LEGAL PACK REVEALS ANOTHER PROBLEM 
THE LEASEHOLD IS UNUSUALLY SHORT 
THAT'S CERTAINLY WORTH CHECKING WITH THE AUCTION HOUSE SELLING IT 
THE LENGTH OF THE LEASE IS ABOUT SIXTY THREE SIXTY FOUR YEARS REMAINING 
THAT WOULD BE SEEN AS A SLIGHT PROBLEM BY SOME MORTGAGE LENDERS 
THEY ARE QUITE STRICT AND STRINGENT AS TO HOW MANY YEARS ON THE LEASE 
THEY WOULD LEND AGAINST 
USUALLY SEVENTY PLUS YEARS THAT'S FINE 
IT WILL BE SELLABLE BUT IF YOU COULD RENEW THE LEASE 
THAT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE 
SO IF THAT WAS SORTED OUT COULD THIS FLAT STAND UP FOR ITSELF ON THE LOCAL MARKET 
THIS PROPERTY COULD BE A CRACKING BUY FOR SOMEBODY 
I THINK YOU KNOW EITHER AS A RENT MACHINE CERTAINLY IF THEY PAY UNDER EIGHTY THOUSAND 
AS A SALEABLE ENTITY IT'S ONLY GOING TO COST FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND 
TO DO A REASONABLE JOB ON IT AND IT WILL SELL VERY WELL 
WELL THIS PLACE REALLY IS A LITTLE GOLDMINE 
AT ANYTHING LIKE THE GUIDE PRICE OF FIFTY FIVE GRAND IF YOU GET FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE A MONTH 
THAT IS DELIVERING YOU ALMOST TEN PER CENT RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT 
THE ONLY DOWN SIDE IS THAT SHORT LEASE WHICH IF YOU'RE GETTING A MORTGAGE MIGHT BE AN ISSUE 
LET'S FIND OUT WHO BOUGHT IT AT THE AUCTION 
LOT EIGHTEEN IS A FIRST FLOOR ONE BED FLAT 
WHO'S GOING TO SAY SIXTY THOUSAND 
SIXTY FIFTY O. K. FIFTY ALL RIGHT 
FIFTY I'VE GOT A FIFTY 
FIFTY TWO AT FIFTY TWO THOUSAND FIRST TIME 
FIFTY FOUR IS STOOD FIFTY OH HELLO SIR RIGHT FIFTY SIX 
FIFTY SIX DO YOU WANT TO WAIT AND 
AT FIFTY EIGHT HE DOESN'T WANT TO RISK IT FIFTY EIGHT STOOD SIR SAYS SIXTY SIR MAY I 
AT SIXTY SIXTY TWO SIXTY THREE IF IT WILL HELP YOU AT SIXTY TWO 
THREE HE SAYS 
AT SIXTY THREE FOUR SIXTY FOUR FIVE 
SIXTY FIVE SIXTY SIX AT SIXTY SIX SIXTY SEVEN 
AT SIXTY EIGHT 
SIXTY NINE AT SIXTY NINE WOULD A HALF HELP 
SIXTY NINE IT WOULD SIXTY NINE AND A HALF 
SEVENTY NOW AT SEVENTY 
AT SEVENTY AT SEVENTY SEVENTY THOUSAND FIRST TIME 
SEVENTY THOUSAND STOOD SECOND TIME 
SEVENTY THOUSAND SURE AND DONE LAST CHANCE YOU TWO BEING SOLD AT SEVENTY THOUSAND 
SIR STOOD 
THE WINNING BIDDERS ARE PAT AND DICK 
THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY DESIGNED AND WORKED ON SEVERAL 
BARN CONVERSIONS IN CORNWALL 
AND THE WINNING BIDDERS ARE ALSO CHRISTINA AND KEITH 
THE COUPLE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED PROPERTIES 
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE FOUR OF THEM HAVE COMBINED FORCES TO BUY 
SO WHERE DID THEY MEET UP 
WE SHARE THE SAME LOCAL YES AND WE MET THERE 
AS SOME OF THESE IDEAS COME UP YOU KNOW OVER A FEW BEERS 
AND DECIDED IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA 
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT ALL INDIVIDUALLY 
WHY JOIN FORCES 
I DON'T KNOW REALLY 
I IT'S PROBABLY CUT YOUR LOSSES IF YOU LIKE MINIMISE THE RISK 
YOU CUT YOUR PROFIT BUT YOU'RE SORT OF MINIMISING THE OUTLAY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE 
SO AS I SAY AFTER A COUPLE OF PINTS AT THE PUB IT SEEMED A GOOD IDEA SO WE THOUGHT WE'D GIVE IT A TRY 
SO WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY 
IT WAS HERE AND IT'S PURE HAPPENSTANCE 
WE HADN'T SEEN IT AT ALL WE HADN'T 
THE ONLY ONE WHO'D SEEN ANYTHING OF IT WAS KEITH 
YES I DROVE PAST ONE DAY I THINK IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE THE AUCTION 
AND THOUGHT YEAH IT LOOKS IN FAIRLY GOOD CONDITION 
I MEAN YOU DIDN'T LOOK ROUND IT THOUGH 
NO WE HADN'T SEEN IT 
BUT WE DID SPEAK TO SCOTT AT THE AUCTIONEERS AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE O. K. 
LET ME GET THE BIG PICTURE YOU MEET DOWN THE PUB 
MM HMM YOU DRIVE BY AND THE AUCTIONEER SAYS YEAH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YEAH AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THE FOUR OF YOU PUT IN SEVENTY THOUSAND 
UH HUH YES 
THIS IS ALL WELL AND GOOD BUT THERE'S A BIT OF A CAUTIONARY TALE HERE 
WHICH IS THAT IF GROUPS OF FRIENDS GET TOGETHER TO DO THIS 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO SORT THE LEGAL SIDE OF IT OUT 
HAVE YOU DONE THAT IS THERE SOME AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU WHICH ISN'T JUST YES 
YES YES PAT AND I 
YES WE'VE ORGANISED OUR OWN BANK ACCOUNT JUST THE TWO OF US 
THE WOMEN HANDLE THE MONEY 
ANY CHEQUES HAVE TO BE SIGNED BY BOTH OF US 
WE ARE PUTTING AN AGREED AMOUNT IN EACH INTO THE ACCOUNT 
AND THAT ACCOUNT IS GOING TO FUND THE CONVERSION 
THE FAB FOUR HAVE WISELY DRAWN UP PAPERWORK DIVIDING THE OWNERSHIP EQUALLY 
THAT PROTECTS THEM ALL AGAINST DISAGREEMENTS SHOULD THE PROJECT SINK 
AND THEY'RE DIVIDING THE WORK EVENLY TOO 
PAT AND DICK ARE EXPERIENCED DESIGNERS 
WHILE CHRIS AND KEITH ARE DOING MOST OF THE PHYSICAL WORK 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE 
BUT THE FINAL VISION FOR THIS PROPERTY SEEMS TO BE A TEAM EFFORT 
STRIP IT BACK SO THAT WE HAVE A BLANK CANVAS 
THE KITCHEN WILL BE COMING OUT BECAUSE THAT'S IN A BIT OF A STATE 
SIMILARLY THE BATHROOM 
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT A BIT OPEN PLAN IF WE CAN 
SO THAT THIS AREA WILL LEAD THROUGH TO THE KITCHEN 
THAT WALL'S GOING TO GO AND AT THE MOMENT THE STAIRWELL LOOKS 
LIKE A LIFT SHAFT SO IF YOU TAKE THAT DOWN AND JUST PUT BANISTERS 
YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN UP THE WHOLE SPACE 
THEIR IDEAS SHOULD BRING MUCH NEEDED LIGHT INTO THE FLAT 
BUT THERE'S ALSO THE PROBLEM OF THAT LEASEHOLD 
WHICH THEY'LL HAVE TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON 
WE'RE TRYING TO NEGOTIATE A LONGER LEASE AT THE MOMENT 
UNFORTUNATELY THE CHAP THAT WE'RE NEGOTIATING WITH 
LIVES IN THAILAND 
RIGHT SO LETTERS HAVE BEEN SENT 
AND WE'RE AWAITING A RESPONSE 
WITH A VIEW TO EITHER EXTEND THE LEASE OR PERHAPS BUY IT OUTRIGHT 
WITH THE LEASE AND THE RENOVATION PROGRESSING THAT LEAVES THE QUESTION 
OF HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY BACK WHEN THIS PROPERTY'S FINISHED 
TELL ME WHAT THE BIG PICTURE PLAN IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO ONCE YOU FINISH IT 
DO ANOTHER ONE RIGHT AND ARE YOU PLANNING TO SELL IT ON 
OH YES IT'LL BE GONE 
YEAH TOP QUALITY 
THE GUYS ALL LOVE IT WE'LL DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE 
SO WHAT ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF RENTING IT OUT 
I SUPPOSE YOU'VE GOT TO BE AWARE THAT PERHAPS THE PROPERTY MARKET TAKES A BIT OF A DIP 
MAYBE THEN WE'D CONSIDER RENTING IT OUT FOR A BIT AND SEE HOW WE GO 
HAVE YOU HAD DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO OR HAS IT BEEN FAIRLY 
NONE NO WE'RE ALL PRETTY GOOD WE'RE ALL PRETTY FAIR AGREED YEAH 
I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS PRETTY MUCH KNOWS WHAT IS THEIR ROLE 
YES WE RESPECT EACH OTHER IN THEIR ROLE AND THAT'S THE END OF IT 
AND WE DISCUSS IT IN THE PUB LUBRICATION IS GOOD 
AND CLEARLY FOR THIS TEAM IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO DO BUSINESS 
WELL I DON'T BELIEVE IT WE ONLY FINISHED CHATTING FIVE MINUTES AGO 
AND THEY'RE ALREADY BACK IN THE PUB 
STILL IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO HAVE YOUR OFFICE 
IF THEY EVER MAKE IT AWAY FROM THE BAR 
YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW THEY GET ON WITH THE PROJECT LATER IN THE SHOW 
WELL WE WAIT PATIENTLY FOR THE PURCHASERS TO DO THEIR WORK 
AND SOMETIMES THEY DO A WONDERFUL JOB 
BUT SOMETIMES AS WE KNOW THEY DON'T DO A SINGLE THING 
HOW HAVE THEY GOT ON THIS TIME 
LETS FIND OUT 
FOR RICHARD BUYING THIS HOUSE IN ROEHAMPTON 
IN SOUTHWEST LONDON FOR TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND WAS THE START OF HIS DREAM 
TO BUILD A STATE OF THE ART VETERINARY HOSPITAL 
IN HIS CURRENT BUILDING THERE WASN'T ROOM TO SWING A CAT AND A NEW 
HOSPITAL WOULD ALLOW HIS PRACTICE TO EXPAND TO MEET GROWING DEMAND 
FIRST HE HAD TO SECURE PLANNING PERMISSION 
SO I'VE WAITED OVER A YEAR BEFORE COMING BACK FOR A CHECK UP 
THE ONLY THING THAT'S HAPPENED TO THE BUILDING IS THAT IT'S FURTHER DETERIORATED 
THE ROOF'S FALLEN IN MORE THERE'S MORE PIGEONS THERE 
AND THERE'S MORE GARBAGE BEING THROWN OVER THE FENCE 
OTHERWISE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING'S HAPPENED TO THE BUILDING 
THE ONLY CREATURES TO HAVE BENEFITED FROM RICHARD'S 
PLANNED VETERINARY HOSPITAL ARE THE PIGEONS 
YOU MIGHT THINK ANYTHING WOULD BE BETTER THAN THIS BUILDING 
BUT IT APPEARS THE COUNCIL AREN'T SO EASILY CONVINCED 
THE MAIN OBJECTIONS THAT WE HAVE FROM COUNCIL 
IS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE IT TO STAY RESIDENTIAL 
WHICH IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THE MAIN OBJECTIONS 
THAT THEY HAVE TO THE PLANNING PROPOSAL RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO ME 
IS THAT THEY WANT IT TO STAY COMMERCIAL AND NOT RESIDENTIAL 
YOU WOULD THINK WE'D BE ABLE TO GET TOGETHER 
BUT THE DEVELOPERS NEXT DOOR ARE VERY KEEN WHEN I SPEAK TO THEM 
ABOUT DOING A COMBINED PROPOSAL BUT NOTHING'S ACTUALLY GONE FORWARD FROM THERE 
TOGETHER BOTH PARTIES COULD COME TO AN ARRANGEMENT THAT BENEFITS EVERYONE 
RICHARD STILL HAS THAT PROBLEM OF ACCESS TO THE SITE 
AND TO RECTIFY THAT HE STILL NEEDS TO BUY THAT SHOP 
AND SO THIS IS THE SHOP HERE 
IT'S BEEN EMPTY FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS NOW 
AND THIS IS THE AREA THAT I NEED TO PURCHASE 
ONCE I PURCHASE THAT 
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT UNTIL I'VE GOT PLANNING PERMISSION 
THEN THIS WOULD BE DEMOLISHED AND THIS IS WHERE THE CAR PARKING WILL BE 
AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S JUST A SMALL AREA 
IT WOULD AN AREA OF ABOUT THREE CARS 
BUT ON A ROAD LIKE THIS IT IS NECESSARY THAT WE DO PROVIDE PARKING 
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BRING THEIR ANIMALS DIRECTLY TO THE PRACTICE 
THE COUNCIL HAVE ALSO OBJECTED TO THE PARKING AS IT WOULD INCREASE TRAFFIC 
BUT AS RICHARD POINTS OUT 
MANY OF THE SICK ANIMALS HAVE NO OTHER WAY TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL 
BUT WHEN HE BOUGHT THE BUILDING 
HE KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE AN EASY OPERATION 
IT'S WEARING IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME 
IT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY TALKING AND COMMUNICATING WITH PEOPLE 
AND TRYING TO EXPRESS WHAT WE WANT TO DO 
AND REALLY TRYING TO EXPRESS MY PASSION FOR WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE HERE 
I REALISED IT WAS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT AND I REALISED 
IT WAS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME AND WE'RE STILL IN THAT PROCESS 
MEANTIME RICHARD'S BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW BUT AS YOU CAN SEE 
THAT IN ITSELF IS A PROBLEM 
THE PRACTICE IS BURSTING AT THE SEAMS AND WE JUST CAN'T 
REALLY FIT ANY MORE PEOPLE IN SO THAT 
IT'S JUST GROWN MASSIVELY AND WE REALLY NEED MORE SPACE 
PLANNING PERMISSION IS NEVER A DEAD CERT 
WHEN BUYING PROPERTY WHICH YOU PLAN TO BUILD ON OR RENOVATE 
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS THAT A DELAY WILL HAVE ON YOUR BUDGET 
RICHARD PAID TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR THIS PLACE 
AND IT'S BEEN SITTING UNTOUCHED FOR OVER A YEAR 
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT HASN'T CONTINUED TO COST MONEY 
FINANCES HAVEN'T BEEN TOO BAD 
BASICALLY WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT ABOUT THREE THOUSAND ON INTEREST FROM THE LOANS 
AND SO FAR WE'VE SPENT ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND ON ARCHITECTURAL FEES 
RICHARD REALISED THIS WAS A LONG TERM PROJECT AND HE'S PREPARED TO BATTLE IT OUT 
BUT DOES HE HAVE A CONTINGENCY 
IF THE PLANNERS DECIDE TO VETO HIS ANIMAL HOSPITAL COMPLETELY 
IF I CONTINUE TO BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN GETTING 
THIS PROJECT THROUGH PLANNING I AM GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE 
THE BUILDING IS TOO SMALL AND WE DO NEED TO GROW 
SO I AM CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR OTHER PREMISES 
IF I FIND ANOTHER PREMISES THAT'S SUITABLE 
AND THAT I CAN GO AHEAD IN THEN I WILL DO SO EVEN THOUGH 
I WOULD PREFER TO STAY IN THIS AREA 
AND IN THAT SITUATION I'LL JUST COMPLY WITH WHAT COUNCIL WANTS 
MAKE THIS INTO APARTMENTS SELL THEM ON TO FINANCE THE NEXT PART OF THE SCHEME 
HOPEFULLY IT WON'T COME TO THAT AND HE COULD STILL MAKE A NICE 
PROFIT FROM THIS LAND IF HE CONCEDED TO THE PLANNERS' WISHES 
SO WHAT DO THE EXPERTS THINK 
I INVITED TWO LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS 
TO COME AND DIAGNOSE RICHARD'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL 
DOES IT HAVE A CAT IN HELL'S CHANCE OR HAS THIS DOG HAD ITS DAY 
THE PROBLEM FOR THE OWNER OF THIS PROPERTY IS 
IF HE'S HAD PLANNING PERMISSION REFUSED FOR THE VETERINARY SURGERY 
WHICH IS WHAT HE WANTED FOR HIS BUSINESS 
HE'S THEN GOT TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES OF RESIDENTIAL EITHER AS A SINGLE HOUSE OR POSSIBLY AS THREE FLATS 
THE MAIN ISSUES THE COUNCIL HAVE IS 
IT'S PRIMARILY A CONSERVATION AREA WITH PUTNEY HEATH 
I THINK THAT'S WHY THEY WANT IT RESIDENTIAL AND ARE STRUGGLING TO PASS IT AS COMMERCIAL 
I THINK THE NEXT THING HE'S GOT TO DO 
IS ACQUIRE THE SHOP IN FRONT BECAUSE THAT LOCKS HIM 
THERE'S NOT A LOT HE CAN DO WITH THE SITE UNTIL HE'S GOT FULL CONTROL 
SO I THINK MUST STRIKE A DEAL WITH THE SHOPOWNERS 
THE OWNER SHOULD MAKE A DEAL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
WITH THE OWNER OF THE SHOP AT THE FRONT TO HAVE THAT DEMOLISHED 
APPLY FOR PLANNING PERMISSION FOR RESIDENTIAL UNIT 
AND PUT IT BACK IN THE AUCTION WITH PLANNING PERMISSION 
THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT RICHARD WANTED TO HEAR 
BUT IF HE DID TAKE THE AGENTS' ADVICE HE'D WALK AWAY FROM THIS WITH A PROFIT 
HE'S SPENT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND ON THE VENTURE 
WHAT FIGURES WOULD HE BE LOOKING AT 
I REALLY THINK THE SITE AS IT STANDS IS PROBABLY ONLY WORTH AT BEST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
IF IT GETS PLANNING THEN THAT COULD GO UP TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED 
I THINK THE BEST WAY FORWARD WOULD BE TO PUT THREE FLATS ON THE SITE 
AND THEY WOULD SELL FOR BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND EACH 
YES THAT'S DEFINITELY MY ESCAPE ROUTE IF I CAN'T GET WHAT I WANT HERE 
THAT'S WHAT I'LL BE ABLE TO DO 
AND THAT'LL HELP ME OUT A LOT BUT I STILL WANT TO BUILD A HOSPITAL 
I'M RIGHT BEHIND HIM 
LET'S HOPE HE GETS THE GO AHEAD FROM THE PLANNERS TO BUILD HIS ANIMAL HOSPITAL 
THOUGH HE COULD BE IN FOR A WAIT HE'S NOT TOO FRUSTRATED BY THE DELAY 
I SEE THIS AS A CLEAR LOGICAL WAY FORWARD 
I SEE THAT IT'S GOOD FOR NOT ONLY MYSELF BUT GOOD FOR THE AREA 
SO I CAN'T SEE ANY REAL FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH IT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF GOING THROUGH THE HURDLES 
EARLIER ON I VISITED THIS ONE BEDROOM FLAT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF PLYMOUTH 
IT WAS IN A BIT OF A STATE BUT WITH A GIANT RECEPTION ROOM 
AND A LOT OF DEMAND IN THE AREA 
IT COULD WELL BE WORTH THE SEVENTY THOUSAND SPENT ON IT 
BY CHRISTINA AND KEITH AND PAT AND DICK 
WE SHARE THE SAME LOCAL YES AND WE MET THERE 
AFTER A COUPLE OF PINTS IN THE PUB IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA 
THREE MONTHS LATER AND TIME TO FIND OUT IF THEIR PARTNERSHIP 
HAS BEEN A SUCCESS 
A QUICK GLIMPSE OF THE STAIRS REVEALS THAT THEY'VE BEEN BUSY 
THE WHOLE FLAT IF NOT FINISHED CERTAINLY SEEMS BIGGER 
AFTER THEY'VE STRIPPED IT RIGHT BACK AND CLIPPED THE WALLS AT THE CORNERS 
TO ALLOW LIGHT IN 
BUT THE STAR SPACE IN THIS FLAT IS THE RECEPTION ROOM 
AND IT JUST GOT EVEN BIGGER 
WELL THE WALL AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS 
WAS BLANKING OUT A LOT OF THE LIGHT AND MADE IT SEEM VERY ENCLOSED 
SO WE THOUGHT WE'D TAKE THAT AWAY 
AND HAVE MORE OF A MEZZANINE SORT OF ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT 
WHAT IS IT THAT NEW LOOK NEW YORK AMERICAN LOFT FEEL 
ABOUT IT IF YOU LIKE IN A SMALL SPACE 
YOU CAN SEE THE LOOK STARTING TO APPEAR ALREADY 
THE WOODEN FLOORS ARE STRIPPED AND READY TO BE VARNISHED 
AND THE MAIN ROOM EVEN HAS A NEW FOCAL POINT 
IT'S NOT A PLACE WITH A LOT OF CHARACTER 
SO ONE THING THAT YOU CAN MAKE A FEATURE OF IS THE FIREPLACE 
I CHOSE IT THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF DISPUTE FROM THE OTHERS 
THEY WEREN'T SURE BUT WHEN THEY SAW IT IN THE FLESH THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
AS WELL AS THE BRIGHT MUCH BETTER LAYOUT THERE'S NEW CENTRAL HEATING AND NEW ELECTRICS 
AND NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON 
THE WIRING WAS IN A DISASTROUS 
AND MOST DANGEROUS STATE WHEN WE GOT HERE 
IT'S NOW SAFE YOU CAN'T KILL YOURSELF IN HERE 
FOR EXAMPLE THERE WAS AN ELECTRIC SHOWER IN THE BATHROOM AND NO FUSE TO IT 
SPARKS GOIND FOR YOUR TEETH IT'S NOT A GOOD THING 
FORTUNATELY THE BATHROOM LOOKS REALLY GOOD NOW AS WELL AS BEING SAFE 
NOT A BAD ACHIEVEMENT IN SUCH A SMALL SPACE 
BUT THE KITCHEN IS DESTINED TO BE AN EVEN BIGGER SUCCESS 
HOW DO I KNOW WELL PAT TOLD ME SO 
IT WAS MY JOB FOR YEARS TO BE A DESIGNER 
IT'S SOMETHING I KNOW HOW TO DO AND I CAN VISUALISE EXACTLY 
HOW SOMETHING'S GOING TO BE AT THE END EVEN WHEN IT'S A TOTAL TIP 
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THIS PLACE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE 
WITH THREE WEEKS BEFORE PAT'S FINAL VISION 
CAN BE SEEN BY ALL HAS THE BUDGET STOOD UP TO HER DEMANDS 
I CHECKED ON IT YESTERDAY 
A BALANCE OF THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SOMETHING YESTERDAY SO 
THE MAJORITY HAS BEEN DONE YEAH 
WE'VE PAID FOR THE KITCHEN AND BATHROOM 
THE ONLY MAJOR EXPENSE WE'VE GOT NOW TO LOOK FORWARD TO 
IF THAT'S THE CORRECT TERMINOLOGY YES 
UM PLASTERING IS THE PLASTERER 
WELL THE FLAT'S BEEN PLASTERED 
AND THE WORK'S COST A GRAND SHY OF THE ORIGINAL FIVE THOUSAND BUDGET 
THE QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER THESE 
FOUR DRINKING BUDDIES HAVE ADAPTED TO SHIFTING WALLS RATHER THAN PINTS 
THE HARDEST WORKER OF THE LOT IS DEAR CHRISTINA 
I'VE NEVER KNOWN ANYBODY PUT SO MUCH ENERGY INTO 
REALLY BORING LITTLE JOBS THAT NOBODY ELSE WANTS TO TOUCH 
WE'VE HAD AN ABSOLUTE RIOT 
WE LAUGH FROM MORNING TILL WE FINISH 
AND WE HAVE NOT HAD A SINGLE CROSS WORD 
AND I CAN'T WAIT TO GET ON TO THE NEXT ONE 
THEY'VE ENJOYED THEMSELVES SO MUCH THEY'RE DETERMINED 
TO DO IT AGAIN AND QUICKLY 
BUT FIRST THEY HAVE TO SELL THIS PLACE AT A PROFIT 
AND IN AN AREA WITH A BOOMING RENTAL MARKET 
THEY'VE SPENT SEVENTY THOUSAND ON THE PROPERTY AND ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND ON REFURBISHMENT 
SO CAN THEY DO IT 
TIME TO ASK THE EXPERTS 
I LIKE THE OPENNESS OF THE FLAT DEFINITELY 
IT WORKS WELL WHERE THEY HAVE THE KITCHEN AND A BATHROOM 
GOOD USE OF THE SPACE 
THE WORK THEY'VE DONE IN THE BATHROOM IS GOOD 
IT'S NEW AND IT'S FRESH 
THAT'S ALL VERY GOOD 
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE WORTH WHEN IT'S FINISHED 
I'D BE LOOKING TO MARKET THE PROPERTY BETWEEN NINETY FIVE AND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
IN A FINISHED CONDITION I'D PUT THIS PROPERTY ON THE MARKET BETWEEN NINETY FIVE TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
THE FAB FOUR ARE LOOKING AT A POSSIBLE PROFIT OF JUST OVER TWENTY K. MINUS COSTS 
THAT'S WITH THE RELATIVELY SHORT LEASEHOLD ON THE PROPERTY WHICH 
THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO EXTEND 
SO ARE THEY HAPPY WITH THOSE FIGURES 
WELL THAT'S NOT TOO BAD AT ALL ACTUALLY 
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE WERE THINKING YES 
I THINK THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT PAY THE BAR TAB WON'T IT 
AH YES THE PUB I FORGOT ABOUT THAT 
IT SERVED THEM WELL AS THEIR H. Q. THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PROJECT 
IT'S CONVENIENT AT THE END OF EVERY DAY WE MEET COUPLE OF PINTS 
BRING THE DOG DOWN BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ALONE ALL DAY 
IT'S WHERE WE STARTED OFF AND IT'S WHERE WE'LL CARRY ON 
WELL IT MAY BE LAST ORDERS FOR THEIR FIRST FLAT 
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE END OF THEIR PARTNERSHIP 
AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL SOON BE TOASTING A GOOD SALE 
THE WORK'S NOW FINISHED AND IT'S GOING ON THE MARKET AT A PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND 
WELL JOIN US NEXT TIME WHEN WE'LL HAVE MORE PROPERTY AUCTION STORIES FOR YOU 
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN GOODBYE GOODBYE
