GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO 
WEDNESDAY'S WORKING LUNCH THE COST 
OF FOOD IS RISING PETROL PRICES 
ARE RACING UP BUT WE'RE GETTING 
PAID MORE SO ARE WE BETTER OR 
WORSE OFF 
HELP IS ON ITS WAY FOR THE TEN PER CENT TAX 
LOSERS THE CHANCELLOR IS NOW 
PROMISING CHANGES BUT WILL THEY BE 
ENOUGH TO HELP YOU 
ROB'S BACK ON THE FARM TO SEE IF 
THIS YEAR'S LAMBS CAN MAKE A PROFIT 
IT IS LAMBING TIME HERE IN THE LAKE 
DISTRICT AND WITH THE COST OF 
PRODUCTION RISING AND FOOD PRICES 
SOARING I HAVE COME BACK TO TAKE A 
LOOK AT THE VIEW FROM 
AND FROM DESIGNING FOR ROYALTY TO 
MAKING FOR MACDONALD'S BRUCE 
OLDFIELD TELLS US ABOUT HIS LATEST 
PROJECT AND HIS EXTRAORDINARY LIFE 
FOOD PRICES ARE SOARING BREAD AND 
EGGS HAVE RISEN UP BY AS MUCH AS 
FIFTY PER CENT AND PETROL PRICES ARE UP 
NEARLY TWENTY PER CENT THE COST OF LIVING IS 
ON THE INCREASE AND THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH IS IMPACTING ON OUR SPENDING 
BUT IS IT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM 
OFFICIAL FIGURES OUT TODAY SHOW 
THAT OUR WEEKLY PAY PACKET IS ON 
THE RISE SO WHAT'S THE TRUTH 
BEHIND THE FIGURES ARE WE BETTER 
OR WORSE OFF FINANCIALLY HERE'S 
RACHEL 
WHEN YOUR WEEKLY SUPERMARKET SHOP 
STARTS TO FEEL LIKE MORE OF A 
SPLURGE THAN A SPEND YOU COULD SAY 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH IS BEGINNING TO 
BITE FIGURES OUT TODAY SUGGEST 
FOOD BILLS FOR THE AVERAGE FAMILY 
HAVE GONE UP FIFTEEN PER CENT IF YOU SPEND ONE HUNDRED 
PER WEEK THAT WILL ADD AN EXTRA 
SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY TO YOUR ANNUAL SHOPPING BILL 
AND WITH THE PRICE OF OIL HITTING A 
RECORD ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS PER BARREL THIS WEEK 
PRICES AT THE PUMPS ARE ALSO ON THE 
UP SO WE ASKED OUR VIEWERS ARE 
THEY FEELING THE PINCH 
DIESEL IS THE WORST OFFENDER IT IS 
ONE TWENTY P. PER LITRE AT THE MOMENT YOU 
LIVE ON AN ISLAND ECONOMY AND 
EVERYTHING IS TRANSPORT BASED SO 
IT IS INSIDIOUS THINGS IT IS A 
PENNY HERE AND A PENNY THERE BUT 
IT'S A SLOW CREEPING UPWARDS OF 
PRICES AND WITH MY WIFE NEEDING TO 
MAKE WEEKLY VISITS TO A HOSPITAL 
WHICH IS EIGHTEEN MILES AWAY AND HER 
ELDERLY MOTHER SHE IS EIGHTY THREE SHE IS A 
STROKE VICTIM AND WE HAVE TO MAKE 
A ROUND TRIP TO VISIT HER ONCE A 
WEEK THAT IS ONE HUNDRED MILES YOU CAN 
SEE THE WAY IT MAKES A TREMENDOUS 
DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE I HAVE NOT NOTICED A HUGE 
DIFFERENCE BUT IT HAS MADE ME 
THINK A LOT MORE ABOUT IT AND I AM 
VERY CONSCIOUS ABOUT THE WAY 
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FEELING AND 
THINKING I DO NOT BELIEVE IN 
CUTTING BACK ON QUALITY BUT 
PERHAPS I WILL BUY THINGS DIRECT 
FROM THE GREENGROCER'S AND 
ACTUALLY MAKING STUFF MYSELF 
RACHEL FOOD AND FUEL PRICES RISING 
GIVE US SOME MORE DETAILS 
THE FOOD 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HAS COME FROM 
A SURVEY OF ITEMS IN SAINSBURY 
ASDA AND TESCO'S WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT BASIC ITEMS HERE THE FIGURES 
WE HAVE GOT A FOR A PINT OF MILK 
ACTUALLY IT IS SIX PINTS OF MILK 
IT WOULD HAVE COST YOU THAT IS 
AN INCREASE OF PASTA PRICES SUGAR PRICES 
PETROL PRICES AS WE HAVE SAID ON 
THE UP A YEAR AGO YOU COULD HAVE 
PAID NINETY TWO P. PER LITRE OF PETROL THAT 
WILL NOW COST TWO AND DIESEL 
COULD COST YOU AS MUCH AS ONE POINT ONE EIGHT NOW 
WE HAD A BIT OF A PREVIEW THERE 
FROM SOME VIEWERS WHAT ELSE HAVE 
THEY BEEN SAYING 
THEY HAVE BEEN IN 
TOUCH WITH US A LOT OVER THIS ISSUE 
TOM IN BELFAST SAYS OVER THE LAST 
TWO MONTHS WE HAVE SEEN FOOD 
PRICES GOING UP AND UP JUDITH IN KENT 
THIS IS THE CRUCIAL POINT WHICH WE 
ARE LOOKING AT TODAY WITH PRICES 
GOING UP IN THAT CASE THE SALARY 
HAS GONE UP IS THAT BEING FELT 
ACROSS THE BOARD OR IS SHE JUST 
LUCKY 
IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT SHE IS LUCKY JUST ONE OF THE LUCKY FEW OFT 
FIGURES SAY THAT AVERAGE WEEKLY 
EARNINGS ARE UP FOR ALL OF US THEY 
SAY THE AVERAGE IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
WAS FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY SIX PER WEEK THAT IS UP BY 
TWENTY TO FOUR EIGHT SIX WE SHOULD BE JOINED 
NOW BY GEORGE JONES FROM BARCLAYS 
CAPITAL IF FOOD AND FUEL PRICES 
ARE RISING BUT WAGES ARE ALSO 
RISING ARE WE ANY WORSE OFF IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION IT IS TRUE 
THAT FOOD PRICES ON THE WAY UP 
THIS IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON SO 
THERE IS SOME VERY STRONG DEMAND 
COMING THROUGH FROM SOME EMERGING 
ECONOMIES SO THERE IS A MIDDLE 
CLASS BUILDING IN CHINA AND INDIA 
AND THESE PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING 
THINGS SUCH AS MEAT WHICH IS 
PUTTING THE PRICE UP FOR ALL OF US 
IT'S QUITE AN INTERESTING PICTURE 
AT THE MOMENT 
GEORGE I AM KEEN TO 
KNOW FOOD PRICES ARE UP BUT IS 
THERE ANY LINKAGE WITH THE CREDIT 
CRISIS HERE OR WOULD FOOD PRICES 
HAVE GONE UP ANYWAY WHAT'S THE 
REASON BEHIND IT 
THIS IS JUST THE 
DEVELOPING WORLD BEGINNING TO HAVE 
AN IMPACT ON COMMODITIES THAT WE 
PRODUCE HERE IT'S NOT ONLY A 
DEMAND THING DEMAND IS STRONG FOR 
FOOD GLOBALLY BUT ALSO ON THE 
SUPPLY SIDE FARMERS JUST ARE NOT 
GROWING CROPS NOW JUSTIFY THIS 
THEY ARE ALSO GROWING CROPS FOR 
THINGS LIKE BIO FUELS FOR OUR CARS 
AND LORRIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
IT'S A CHANGING WORLD IT'S LOOKING 
LIKE FOOD PRICES WILL GET STRONGER 
THERE HAVE BEEN MINUTES OUT TODAY 
FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND SHOWING 
THAT WHEN THE M. P. C. DECIDED TO CUT 
INTEREST RATES THIS MONTH THEY 
WERE SPLIT OVER THAT DECISION 
THEIR JOB IS TO TRY AND CONTROL 
INFLATION IN THE U. K. IF FOOD PRICES 
ARE GOING UP FUEL PRICES AS WELL 
WAGES AS WELL CAN THEY REALLY 
AFFORD TO CUT INTEREST RATES AGAIN 
THE WAY THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
ARE LOOKING AT THE ECONOMY IS TO 
JUDGE WHERE INFLATION IS GOING TO 
BE IN TWO YEARS' TIME SO WHEN IT 
MAKES HIS DECISIONS ON INTEREST 
RATES MONTH TO MONTH IT'S GOING 
TO BE THE INFLATION PICTURE IN THE 
FUTURE WHICH MATTERS SO IT IS THE 
OUTLOOK FOR ACTIVITY RATHER THAN 
PRICES THAT IS CRUCIAL FOR THE M. P. C. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE WANT TO KNOW IF YOU ARE FEELING 
THE CRUNCH AND IF YOU HAVE GOT ANY 
HINTS TO HELP OTHERS TO WATCH THIS 
PROGRAMME DEAL WITH RISING PRICES 
YOU CAN SEND YOUR E. MAILS TO THE 
USUAL ADDRESS 
DO YOU KNOW THE PROGRAMME THAT YOU 
WORK FOR 
YOU HAVE HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PER CENT TAX BAND 
AFTER THREATENED REBELLION BY M. P.'S 
IT SEEMS THE CHANCELLOR IS READY TO 
MAKE SOME CONCESSIONS JAMES 
LANDALE IS AT WESTMINSTER WHAT IS 
HAPPENING 
ESSENTIALLY A MASSIVE HAPPENING MOVE BY THE GOVERNMENT TO INDICATE 
THAT THEY WILL BE MAKING SOME 
PARTIAL COMPENSATION TO THOSE 
PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE LOST OUT AS A 
RESULT OF THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN PER CENT 
TAX RATE HE HAS WRITTEN IN A 
DETAILED LETTER TO THE TREASURY 
SELECT COMMITTEE OUTLINING SOME OF 
THE PROPOSALS THAT HE WILL EXAMINE 
NOT MASSIVE FULL COMPENSATION HE 
IS NOT PLANNING TO RESTORE FOR 
EXAMPLE FEE TEN PER CENT TAX RATE BUT HE 
HAS GONE THROUGH THE VARIOUS GROUPS 
THAT HAVE BEEN HIT AND HE WILL BE 
SAYING THESE ARE THE IDEAS THAT 
WE ARE LOOKING AT FOR EXAMPLE 
PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN AGE WHO FALL 
BETWEEN TWO GAPS HE HAS SAID THAT 
HE WILL BE LOOKING TO HELP THEM 
THROUGH THE WINTER FUEL ALLOWANCE 
AND HE WILL BE HOPING TO BACKDATE 
THAT TO THE BEGINNING OF THIS 
FINANCIAL YEAR A FEW WEEKS AGO IN 
TERMS OF THOSE COUPLES WHO DO NOT 
HAVE CHILDREN HE WILL BE LOOKING 
AT CHANGING THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM 
TO OFFSET WHAT HE CALLS THE AVERAGE 
LOSSES THEY HAVE INCURRED AS A 
RESULT OF LOSING THE TEN PER CENT TAX RATE 
AND THIRDLY HE HAS TALKED ABOUT 
HELPING YOUNGER WORKERS PEOPLE 
UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE WHO DO NOT 
QUALIFY FOR WORKING TAX CREDIT HE 
HAS SAID THAT HE WILL BE 
COMMISSIONING THE LOW PAY 
COMMISSION TO PRODUCE A REPORT TO 
SEE IF THE MINIMUM WAGE CAN BE USED 
TO BEEF UP THEIR INCOMES ALONG 
LIST OF OPTIONS NO FIRM 
COMMITMENTS BUT A LONG LONG WAY 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS MOVED ON THIS 
IT IS SURPRISING BECAUSE I THOUGHT 
WHEN THE FIRST THING BLEW UP AT THE 
GOVERNMENT SAID PEOPLE HAVE NOT 
BEEN BADLY AFFECTED AT ALL THE 
NUMBERS ARE RUBBISH IS THIS NOT AN 
ADMISSION THAT THEY GOT IT WRONG 
YES IT IS A TACIT ADMISSION THAT 
THEY GOT IT WRONG THEIR POLITICAL 
ANTENNAE DID NOT GET IT RIGHT IF 
YOU TALK TO THE TREASURY THEY WILL 
POINT YOU TOWARDS MINISTERIAL 
STATEMENTS WHICH CAME OUT LAST YEAR 
SAYING THIS IS OUR VIEW IN THE 
TREASURY YES FIVE MILLION PEOPLE 
WILL BE HIT TO VARYING DEGREES 
BUT WITHIN DOWNING STREET THERE 
HAS BEEN A REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THAT 
THE MESSAGE THAT HAS COME OUT FROM 
DOWNING STREET HAS BEEN TO SAY THAT 
WHEN THIS CHANGE WAS INTRODUCED 
THE PRIME MINISTER THEN THE 
CHANCELLOR MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE 
HAD CHANGED TAX CREDITS AS A RESULT 
OF THAT BUDGET BUT THEY ALL WENT 
TO PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE COUPLES 
WITH CHILDREN ALL OF THE 
TRADITIONAL AREAS WHERE THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN HELPING IN THE 
PAST BUT BASICALLY THEY MISSED 
OUT LARGE GAPS 
THE ENERGY REGULATOR OFGEM HAS 
LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION INTO 
NPOWER FOLLOWING ALLEGATIONS ABOUT 
ITS SELLING PRACTICES IT'S CLAIMED 
THAT NPOWER'S DOOR TO DOOR 
SALESPEOPLE HAD BEEN MIS SELLING 
ENERGY CONTRACTS TO CUSTOMERS IN 
LONDON NPOWER SAYS IT'S VERY 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF 
SMALL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND HAS 
LAUNCHED ITS OWN INVESTIGATION 
AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS MET WITH A 
COALITION OF CHARITIES AS CONCERNS 
GROW 
GROW THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING 
FROM FUEL POVERTY GROUPS LIKE 
ENERGYWATCH HELP THE AGED AND SAVE 
THE CHILDREN FEAR THAT FOUR MILLION 
PEOPLE ARE NOW SPENDING MORE THAN 
TEN PER CENT OF THEIR INCOME ON FUEL AND 
SAY VOLUNTARY MEASURES TO TACKLE 
THE PROBLEM AREN'T WORKING 
THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING IS 
GIVING SUPERMARKET CHAIN MORRISONS 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AFTER IT WRONGLY NAMED IT 
IN A PROBE IT CONDUCTED INTO PRICE 
FIXING THE REGULATOR WRONGLY 
INCLUDED THE RETAILER IN LIST OF 
THOSE IT SUSPECTED OF BREAKING 
RULES OVER THE PRICE OF DAIRY 
PRODUCTS THE OFT SAID IT WISHED TO 
SINCERELY APOLOGISE FOR THESE 
SERIOUS ERRORS 
AND TALKS BETWEEN UNIONS AND 
MANAGEMENT FROM THE GRANGEMOUTH OIL 
REFINERY HAVE RESUMED AT THE 
ARBITRATION SERVICE ACAS BOTH 
PARTIES HAVE BEGUN ROUND TABLE 
NEGOTIATIONS AFTER FIVE HOURS OF 
TALKS YESTERDAY BROKE UP WITHOUT 
ANY RESOLUTION MEANWHILE THE PLANT 
ITSELF IS CONTINUING A GRADUAL 
SHUTDOWN AHEAD OF THE PLANNED 
STRIKE ON MONDAY 
ADAM THE MARKETS AND OUR 
COLLEAGUE JEREMY PAXMAN'S 
COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE SUPPORT VALUES 
OF M. AND AMP S. UNDERPANTS HAS NOT DONE THEM 
ANY HARM IT SEEMS 
I AM SURE 
UNDERPANTS SALES WENT UP AND THE 
HEAD OF MARKS AND SPENCERS STUART 
ROSE SAID HE IS CONFIDENT OF 
PROFITABLE GROWTH DESPITE A 
DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT IN THE 
RETAILING SECTOR UNUSUAL FOR THEM 
TO COME OUT AND SAY SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT IT IS IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR 
THOSE WHO OWN SHARES IN M. AND AMP S. WHERE 
ARE THEY BUT MARKS AND AMP SPENCER'S IS 
OUR BIGGEST CLOTHING RETAILER IT 
ALSO POSTED ITS WORST QUARTERLY 
PERFORMANCE IN TWO YEARS BACK IN 
JANUARY SO THIS IS A VERY 
INTERESTING INSIGHT INTO WHAT IS 
GOING ON IN THAT VERY IMPORTANT 
RETAIL SECTOR M. AND AMP S. SHARES HAVE HAD 
A TOUGH TIME UNCHANGED TODAY BUT 
MILLIONS WIPED OFF THE VALUE OF 
THAT COMPANY IN THE PAST YEAR 
ALLIANCE AND AMP LEICESTER IT IS DOWN 
AND WITH THE CONCERN IN THE BANKING 
SECTOR AT THE MOMENT THAT MIGHT 
WORRY YOU IT IS BASICALLY A 
TECHNICAL MOVE BECAUSE IT HAS GONE 
EX DIVIDEND TODAY THAT MEANS THAT 
FROM TODAY NEW BUYERS OF THE 
SHARES DO NOT GET ENTITLED TO THE 
NEXT DIVIDEND PAYOUT THAT IS WHAT 
IS BEHIND THAT PARTICULAR FALL FOR 
ALLIANCE AND AMP LEICESTER ELSEWHERE 
THE MONEY LENDER CATTLES IS 
RAISING MONEY FROM A RIGHTS ISSUE 
THE MONEYLENDER CATTLE'S ITS 
SHARES ARE UP BY FOURTEEN PER CENT SHARES IN 
THE BANKS HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE 
POOREST PERFORMERS THIS MORNING 
HERE ARE A COUPLE OF THEM RBS 
WHICH FAMOUSLY HAS HAD A RIGHTS 
ISSUE THAT WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY 
SHARES ARE DOWN TODAY L. HAVE HAD A 
LOT OF PEOPLE WRITING TO ME ABOUT 
THIS ONE SHARON SLATER WROTE IN 
TO SAY THAT SHE USED TO WORK FOR 
RBS FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS AND HAS INVESTED 
IN THE COMPANY SHE WORKED FOR SHE 
IS CONCERNED BY THE PROSPECT OF THE 
RIGHTS ISSUE SHE SAYS SHE DOES NOT 
SEE THAT SHE WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD 
TO TAKE UP THOSE RIGHTS IF THAT 
HAPPENS WHAT WILL THIS MEAN FOR 
HER EXISTING HOLDING SHE ASKS 
THIS IS THE PROBLEM YOU ARE FACING 
IF YOU HOLD SHARES IN RBS YOU 
EITHER HAVE TO INVEST MORE MONEY 
BUY MORE SHARES TO MAINTAIN YOUR 
SHAREHOLDING WHICH WILL COST YOU 
OR YOU DO NOTHING AND YOU LOSE 
MONEY BY HAVING YOUR SHAREHOLDING 
DILUTED IT DOES DEPEND ON WHAT YOU 
THINK THE FUTURE FOR THE BANKING 
SECTOR IS AND ALSO WON YOUR 
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES I AM 
AFRAID 
THORNTONS HAS GOT MORE STORES THE 
GROUP WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN ELEVEN IT SAID 
IT WAS CONFIDENT ABOUT TRADING 
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR IT DID SEE 
INCREASING COSTS LONMIN IT GOT 
THAT NAME IT USED TO BE CALLED THE 
LONDON AND RHODESIAN MINE COMPANY 
IT SAW PRODUCTION LEVELS DIP ITS 
SHARES ARE UP 
RIO TINTO IS DOWN A TOUCH THERE 
F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IT IS DEAD ON SIX THOUSAND BUT 
IT IS DOWN THIRTY FOUR POINTS 
MORE EVIDENCE THAT THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH IS BEGINNING TO BITE 
FIGURES OUT TODAY SHOW A HUGE FORTY SIX PER CENT 
DROP IN THE NUMBER OF MORTGAGE 
APPROVALS FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO BUY 
A HOME OVER THE LAST YEAR THE NEWS 
COMES JUST A DAY AFTER THE 
CHANCELLOR MET WITH MORTGAGE 
COMPANIES TO DISCUSS HOW THEY COULD 
HELP HARD PRESSED BORROWERS 
MICHAEL COOGAN IS FROM THE COUNCIL 
OF MORTGAGE LENDERS HE WAS AT THE 
MEETING FIRST OF ALL LET'S CUT TO 
THE QUICK HERE WE WILL TALK ABOUT 
MEASURES BEING TAKEN IN A MOMENT 
DID YOU GIVE ANY ASSURANCES OR ANY 
MEASURES AGREED WITH THE CHANCELLOR 
YESTERDAY THAT WILL EITHER HEAD OFF 
REPOSSESSIONS OR HELP WITH THE 
MORTGAGE RATES 
WELL FIRST THING 
IN TERMS OF REPOSSESSIONS WE 
ASSURED THE CHANCELLOR WE ARE 
TRENDING BELOW OUR ARREARS 
FORECASTS AND THAT SHOWS PEOPLE 
COMING OUT OF FIX FIXED RATES IN 
THE LAST SIX MONTHS ARE HAVING TO 
FACE HIGHER PAYMENTS BUT ARE 
AFFORDING THEM AND THAT IS GOOD 
NEWS FOR THE FOURTEEN MILLION IN THE 
FUTURE BECAUSE THE HIGHEST PAYMENT 
SHOCK WAS POTENTIALLY FOR THOSE 
CUSTOMERS LAST YEAR WHO CAME OUT OF 
FIXED RATES IN TERMS OF NEW 
CUSTOMERS WE ARE THE VICTIMS OF 
THE GLOBAL CREDIT CRUNCH AND THAT 
MEANS THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY 
AVAILABLE TO DELIVER ALL THE LOANS 
CUSTOMERS MAY WANT IN PRACTICAL 
TERMS THAT MEANS HOUSE PURCHASES 
ARE BEING SQUEEZED OUT AND THERE'S 
SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY MILLION OF 
POTENTIAL CONSUMER DEMAND THAT 
CAN'T BE MADE 
VERY LITTLE SOLICE 
FOR THE CHANCELLOR OR NEW MORTGAGE 
SEEKERS BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU TALK 
ABOUT THE FIXED TERM PEOPLE LAST 
YEAR WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE NOW WHO 
ARE GOING TO BE COMING OUT OF FIXED 
TERM LIFE IS GOING TO REMAIN TOUGH 
FOR THEM 
WE ARE SAYING ANYONE 
COMING OUT OF A FIXED RATE SHOULD 
SPEAK TO THEIR LENDER BEFORE THEY 
COME OUT AND THEY NEED TO PLAN 
AHEAD TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN AFFORD 
HIGHER PAYMENTS MANY WILL BE ABLE 
TO REFINANCE WITH THEIR EXISTING 
LENDER AND REFINANCE TO SOMEONE 
ELSE IN THE MARKET THEY WON'T BE 
ABLE TO HIDE THE COMPLETE COST OF 
THE INCREASES OF INTEREST RATES 
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS AS A 
RESULT OF THE LONDON INTERBANK 
RATES BEING HIGH BUT WHAT THEY ARE 
ABLE TO DO AND WHAT THEY ARE 
DEMONSTRATING BY MANNING AHEAD THEY 
ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THOSE INCREASES 
WE ARE LOOKING TO THE MARKET TO 
IMPROVE OVER TIME THE KEY NEW 
INITIATIVE HAS BEEN THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND'S FACILITIES THAT IS GOING 
TO COME THROUGH OVER THE COMING 
MONTHS AND THAT WILL PROVIDE MORE 
MONEY AND THAT SHOULD BE RECYCLED 
FOR FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS LOOKING TO 
MOVE THIS YEAR 
TALK TO ME ABOUT 
REPOSSESSIONS THE WORD IS YOU ARE 
RAMPING UP RATES GETTING YOUR 
MARGINS UP IN ANTICIPATION OF THE 
EXTRA BURDEN THAT REPOSSESSIONS ARE 
GOING TO PUT ON THAT THAT SEEMS TO 
SUGGEST YOUR MEMBERS ARE EXPECTING 
LARGER REPOSSESSIONS 
OUR FORECAST 
FOR THIS YEAR IS FORTY FIVE THOUSAND POSSESSIONS 
LAST YEAR WE HAD AN OUTTURN OF 
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND POSSESSIONS AND WE WERE 
UNDER SHOCKED AT OUR EXPECTATIONS 
BY TEN PER CENT WE WERE ABLE TO SAY TO THE 
CHANCELLOR WE ARE STILL BELOW THE 
FORTY FIVE THOUSAND FIGURE AND WE WILL BE 
TRACKING THAT MONTH ON MONTH THERE 
ISN'T ANY CASE THAT THE PRICES ARE 
GOING UP IN ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE 
REPOSSESSION PICTURE WHAT IS 
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE IS THE COST 
OF FUNDS REMAINS HIGH AND THAT HAS 
TO BE PASSED ON TO CUSTOMERS 
FOR THREE THREE YEAR WE HAVE BEEN 
FOLLOWING 
THE FORTUNES OF 
FARM IN THE LAKE DISTRICT MONEY FASTER FARM HAS BEEN THROUGH MUNCASTER 
FARM WITH FOOD PRICES SOARING AND 
FOOD PRODUCTION MOVING ON THE 
PO LITICAL AGENDA WE HAVE RETURNED 
TO FIND OUT HOW THINGS ARE ON THE 
FARM FARM AS YOU CAN SEE I HAVE LOST NONE OF 
THE SKILLS I ACQUIRED TWO YEARS AGO 
WHEN I CAME HERE TWO YEARS AND AND 
SPENT A WEEK WORKING HERE IT IS 
SPRINGTIME AGAIN AND IT IS LAMBING 
TIME SO I HAVE COME ALONG TO SEE 
HOW THINGS ARE GOING THESE TWO 
HAVE JUST BEEN BORN THEY ARE A DAY 
OLD HOW DO THEY SEE THINGS IN THE 
WORLD OF AGRICULTURE HERE AND HOW 
DO THEY SEE THE FUTURE OF FARMING 
AND OF OUR FOOD TOO 
ALISTAIR MACKINTOSH FARMS SIX HUNDRED FORTY ACRES 
OF LAKELAND FELINGS THIS SPRING HE 
IS EXPECTING TO PRODUCE AROUND 
ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED LAMBS DEMAND FOR THEM IS 
HIGH AND PRICES ARE RISING EVEN 
VETERAN FARMER LIKE ALISTAIR IS 
GLAD TO SEE THE RISES BUT HE IS 
STILL CAUTIOUS 
I MUST ADMIT SOME 
OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE SEEING A RISE 
O. I. STILL WE STILL HAVE TO ACCEPT 
THE FACT THE CRISIS HASN'T GOT TO 
THE POINT WHERE THERE'S PROFIT BACK 
IN FARMING YET UNFORTUNATELY WE 
HAVE SEEN RECENTLY HUGE INCREASES 
IN INPUT COSTS FERTILISER ALL TO 
DO WITH OIL PRICE FUEL PRICE ALL 
TO DO WITH OIL PRICE AND THIS AS 
WELL AS THAT WE HAVE HAD A 
DOUBLING OF FOOD PRICES IT IS A 
BIG ISSUE FOR US IT'S ALSO A BIG 
CONCERN I DON'T ENJOY SEEING OUR 
CONSUMER COMPLAINING ABOUT THE 
PRICE OF FOOD THE REALITY IS WE 
NEED A FAIR PRICE AND AND THAT'S 
PROBABLY WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE WE 
ARE GOING OF IT TO SEE HIGHER 
PRICES 
IT MAY SEEM STRANGE TO HEAR PRICES FARMERS WORRIED ABOUT PROFITS WHEN 
PRICES ARE SO HIGH ALISTAIR HAS 
JUST SOLD THREE BULLS AT MARKET AND 
GOT SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY EACH FOR THEM THAT IS A 
RISE OF ONE HUNDRED ON LAST YEAR BUT HIS 
COSTS ARE SOARING IN THE SAME 
PERIOD FERTILISER HAS RISEN FROM 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FEED HAS GONE UP TOO 
FROM ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN TO TWO HUNDRED FIVE A TONNE THE RED 
DIESEL USED BY FARMERS HAS 
INCREASED FROM THIRTY TWO PENCE A LITRE TO 
SIXTY PENCE LAST YEAR THE FARM MADE A 
PROFIT BUT ONLY JUST OF EIGHT THOUSAND 
SOMEONE IS MAKING MONEY SOMEWHERE 
YOU ARE SAYING IT IS NOT COMING 
BACK TO FARMERS 
IT'S COMING BACK 
TO THE FARMERS IN THE EXTENT THAT 
IT COVERS THE INPUT COSTS WE ARE 
STILL PRODUCING AT BELOW THE COST 
OF PRODUCTION THE SUBSIDIES NO 
LONGER THERE AND YET WE ARE STILL 
BEING PAID AS THOUGH SUBSIDY WAS 
THERE TO PROP UP THE INDUSTRY AT 
THE SAME TIME FERTILISER FEED 
FUEL COSTS THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY 
ELSE MY MORTGAGE IS GOING UP 
EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOING THROUGH 
THE ROOF SO WE ARE FINDING 
OURSELVES WITH THAT GAP WIDENING 
THAT GAP TO PROFITABILITY IS 
WIDENING AND IT'S A REAL TOUGH ONE 
TO RECONCILE WHEN WE SEE OUR 
CONSUMERS FINDING IT TOUGHER TO 
AFFORD THE PRODUCT BECAUSE AS A 
CONSUMER MYSELF I AM GOING THROUGH 
THE PAIN TOO 
AS WELL AS BEING A 
LAKE DISTRICT FARMER ALISTAIR IS 
ALSO CHAIRMAN OF THE LIFE STOCK 
BOARD OF THE NATIONAL FARMERS 
FARMERS UNION HE SEES A THREAT FOR 
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WITH DEMAND FOR 
FOOD RISING AROUND THE WORLD WHILST 
FARMING STOCKS AT HOME ARE FALLING 
WE ARE LOOKING AT A SHEEP SECTOR 
THAT HAS GONE FROM NINETEEN MILLION 
PROJECTED LEVELS OF LOOKING AT FIFTEEN 
MILLION SHEEP IN THIS COUNTRY WE 
HAVE SEEN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY GO 
FROM THIRTY THOUSAND DAIRY FARMERS TO THIRTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
DAIRY FARMERS WE ARE LOOKING AT 
THE BEEF INDUSTRY CLINGING FROM TWENTY FIVE 
MILLION TO LESS THAN TWO MILLION WE 
ARE SEEING A SHRINKING OF THE 
INDUSTRY WE ARE ALSO SEEING THE 
AGE OF FARMERS INCREASING AND AS 
THEY RETIRE VERY FEW COMING ON 
BEHIND TO TAKE UP THE REINS IT IS 
CRUCIAL OUR GOVERNMENT WAKENS UP TO 
THE SUPPLY ISSUE GONE ARE THE DAYS 
WHEN YOU CAN TURN ROUND AND SAY IF 
THE SUPPLY IS NOT COMING FROM HOME 
WE CAN GET IT FROM ABROAD THERE 
ARE MANY MANY MORE MARKETS OUT 
THERE NOW THAT THAT SUPPLY IS BEING 
FOCUSED OR DIRECTED TO INDIA INDIA CHINA 
ABSOLUTELY TYPICAL EXAMPLE CHINA THE JAPANESE TEN YEARS AGO THOUGHT 
THEY COULD ALWAYS SOURCE FOOD 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WE HAVE SEEN 
RICE GO FROM TWO DOLLARS A BAG UP TO FIFTY DOLLARS A 
BAG THEY ARE FINDING IT VERY TOUGH 
I BET THEY WISH THEY HAD LOOKED 
AFTER THEIR HOME SUPPLY NOW BECAUSE 
THE FOOD INFLATION IN THAT COUNTRY 
IS ENORMOUS WE ARE GOING THROUGH A 
SIMILAR PROCESS BUT WE CAN STILL 
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT IF WE AS 
FARMERS ARE VALUED AS FOOD 
PRODUCERS AND ALLOWED TO EMBRACE 
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION THEN WE 
HAVE THE FUTURE IS GOOD 
WHEN WE 
FIRST CAME HERE THREE YEARS AGO ALL 
THE TALK WAS ABOUT A FARMING CRISIS 
NOW THE TALK IS ABOUT A FOOD CRISIS 
IT'S NOT JUST HERE IN THE U. K. IT IS 
RIGHT ACROSS THE WHOLE WORLD TOO 
SOMETIMES ON A SUNNY DAY LIKE THIS 
AND IN A FIELD FULL OF LAMBS THE 
WORLD CAN SEEM A LONG WAY AWAY BUT 
IT'S IT'S WHAT HAPPENS AT FARMS 
LIKE THIS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS 
WILL DETERMINE HOW WE COPE WITH OUR 
CRISIS CRISIS HE'S DRESSED ROYALS INCLUDING 
PRINCESS DIANA AND CATHERINE ZETA 
JONES HIS LATEST CLIENTS ARE 
LIKELY TO BE SKDS FOR A HAPPY MEAL 
BRUCE OLDFIELD'S NEW UNIFORM FOR 
MCDONALD'S WAS UNVEILED TODAY 
WE CAN SEE IT HERE IT IS REPLACED 
WITH A NEUTRAL PALATE AND A RATHER 
DRINKY SCARF THE NEW DESIGN WILL 
BE WORN BY THE CHAIN'S SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND STAFF 
WILL THEY BE LOVING IT IS THE 
QUESTION WE ARE GOING TO TO ASK WE 
ARE GOING TO ASK IT OF THE MAN 
BEHIND IT HOW DID YOU DO THE DEAL 
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT NORMALLY 
ASSOCIATED WITH FAST FOOD 
I DO 
WORK FOR A UNIFORM COMPANY AND THEY 
WERE THE ONES WHO APPROACHED ME 
BECAUSE I COULDN'T MAKE SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
UNIFORMS IT WAS YES PLEASE 
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GET INVOLVED 
IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE PEOPLE 
WHO GO TO MCDONALD'S ARE NOT THE 
PEOPLE WHO SPEND LOTS OF MONEY ON 
YOUR DRESSES NRMALLY NO DOESN'T NO DOESN'T IT RUIN THE BRAND 
NOT IN THE 
SLIGHTEST THAT IS A VERY OLD 
FASHIONED CONCEPT L. THINK THAT 
PEOPLE TODAY ARE MORE PRAGMATIC 
ABOUT THIS KIND OF THING L. AM AN 
EXPERT IN WHAT I DO I GUESS L. 
HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR NEARLY FORTY 
YEARS I THINK THAT IS WHAT THEY 
WANT DESIGN AND MY EYE AND HOW 
THINGS ARE MADE AND HOW THINGS WILL 
FIT 
YOU ARE NOT THE FIRST HIGH FIT CLASS HIGH QUALITY DESIGNER TO WORK 
WITH WORK WEAR BOAC WE HAD HARDY 
AIMES AND ALSO CHRISTIAN DIRO WAS 
DRESSING NURSES BUT THE POINT THERE 
WAS IT DIDN'T LAST VERY LONG ARE 
YOU EXPECTING LONGEVITY ON YOUR 
MEALS HERE 
I THINK THEY ARE GOING 
TO BE CHANGED EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND 
THEY WILL PROBABLY CHANGE THE 
DESIGN IN THREE YEARS' TIME L. L. 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT LONGEVITY AS LONG 
AS THE PEOPLE ARE HAPPY WEARING 
THEM WE CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE WE WE WERE CHATTING BEFORE THE PROGRAMME 
ABOUT THE DEPRESSING NEWS YOU FELT 
WAS AROUND EVERYWHERE IS A 
BUSINESS LIKE YOURS AFFECTED BY THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH AND WORRIES ABOUT THE 
ECONOMY 
NOT REALLY WE ARE TOUCH ECONOMY WOOD WE ARE DOING FANTASTICALLY 
WELL 
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS ARE WELL THE RICH ALWAYS RICH 
I THINK THEY 
ARE IF YOU STICK TO YOUR GUNS I 
HAVE JUST LAUNCHED A BRIDAL 
COLLECTION AND WE ARE PRICED RIGHT 
UP THERE AND PEOPLE SAY ARE YOU MAD 
YOU ARE SO EXPENSIVE I SAID NO 
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ONE HUNDRED A 
YEAR I WOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE TWENTY 
AT THOSE PRICES 
I WAFRNT TO ASK 
YOU ABOUT THE COLOUR WE HAVE OTHER 
SHOTS OF THEM SHOWING THIS COLOUR 
WHO WEARS BROWN THEN I LOOKED AT 
MY CO PRESENTER YOU ARE CALLING IT 
MOCCA 
IT IS MOCCA 
FUNNY COLOUR MOCCA FOR THIS DAY AND AGE BECAUSE BECAUSE MCDONALD'S ARE UPGRADING THE IMAGE 
OF THEIR STORES THE COLOURS ARE 
REALLY VIBRANT A LITTLE LIKE WHAT 
WE HAVE HERE YOU DON'T WANT TO 
HAVE BRIGHT RED AND AND PINK IN THE 
UNIFORM SOMETHING NEUTRAL 
SOMETHING A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES 
OF PEOPLE CAN WEAR AN OLDER PERSON 
CAN WEAR IT DIFFERENTETH NISITIES 
CAN WEAR IT A NEUTRAL PALATES 
WORKS AND IT IS NOT SUBJECT TO 
WANTING TO BE CHANGED IN SIX 
MONTHS' TIME 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOR JOINING US 
WE HAVE JUST GOT TIME TO GIVE YOU 
SOME OF THE VIEWER E. MAILS THAT 
HAVE BEEN COMING IN PARTICULARLY 
ABOUT THE CREDIT CRUNCH ALAN SAYS 
HOW CAN FOUR PER CENT SALARY RISE COMPENSATE 
FOR THE SIXTY AND EIGHTY PER CENT RISING IN MANY 
BASIC FOODSTUFFS L. AM A PENSIONER 
GEOFF SAYS MY PENSION HAS GONE UP 
BY FOUR PER CENT BUT BASIC PRICES OF 
GROCERIES AND FUELS HAVE GONE UP SO 
MUCH MORE THAN THAT WHEN PRICE 
INCREASES ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT 
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE THAT PEOPLE AT 
THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE 
ARE BETTER OFF 
WE ARE BACK AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TOMORROW 
GOODBYE FROM US AND FROM HIM
