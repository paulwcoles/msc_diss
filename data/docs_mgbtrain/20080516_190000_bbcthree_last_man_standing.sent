SIX YOUNG ATHLETES HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE OF A LIFETIME 
TO TRAVEL THE WORLD AND COMPETE AGAINST THE MOST REMOTE TRIBES ON EARTH 
ON THEIR OWN TURF 
I AM REALLY BRICKING IT 
OH 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE'RE GOING 
ALL SIX MEN ARE MASTERS IN THEIR CHOSEN FIELDS 
COVERING THE HEAVY LIFTING BRAD BRINGS THE BRAWN 
HEY I'M A STRONG MAN EVERY COMPETITION YOU ARE YOUR ONE MAN ARMY 
OXFORD GRADUATE RICHARD IS ENGLISH GRIT 
I LOVE TO WIN I HATE LOSING 
JASON'S A CHAMPION B. M. X. SPRINTER WHO'S FOUGHT HIS WAY TO THE TOP 
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT THE OLD PHRASE CAN'T BEAT 'EM JOIN 'EM 
I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IN THAT 
CAN'T BEAT 'EM YOU CHEAT 
MARK IS ALL TECHNIQUE 
A SALSA DANCER WITH A PUNCH 
I'M PRETTY GOOD AT EVERYTHING THAT I DO 
COREY'S A HARVARD EDUCATED SCIENTIST 
I'LL USE MY BRAIN BEFORE I'LL USE MY MUSCLE 
AND A TOP ENDURANCE ATHLETE 
CONQUERED 
AND RAJKO'S A FITNESS GURU 
WITH A BODY HONED TO PERFECTION 
I WANT TO ACHIEVE MY OPTIMUM AS A PHYSICAL BEING 
OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS ALL SIX WILL BE PUT THROUGH HELL 
BUT WILL THEIR WESTERN SKILLS COUNT FOR ANYTHING 
AS THEY'RE HURLED INTO A WORLD OF TRIBAL SPORT 
AND RITUAL 
UNLIKE ANYTHING THEY'VE EVER SEEN 
COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BE THE LAST MAN STANDING 
OUR ATHLETES ARE IN MEXICO HEADING HIGH INTO THE SIERRA MADRE 
I'VE NEVER EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS I'M JUST SPEECHLESS 
THEY'RE ON THE THIRD LEG OF A CONTEST THAT'S TAKING THEM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
IN BRAZIL THEY FOUGHT KALAPALO WARRIORS IN A FESTIVAL OF DEATH 
BRAD'S STRENGTH BROUGHT HIM OUT ON TOP THAT'S RIGHT I'M BRAD 
AND AGAINST ZULU FIGHTERS IT WAS MARK'S SKILL IN MARTIAL ARTS THAT CLINCHED HIM THE TOP PRIZE 
BUT THEIR CHALLENGE IN MEXICO IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFERENT 
IT'S A HIGH ALTITUDE RUNNING RACE IN THE MOUNTAINS 
THAT WILL TEST OUR ATHLETE'S BODIES TO DESTRUCTION 
IT HURTS 
AND LEAVE THEIR CONFIDENCE IN SHREDS 
I JUST CAN'T DO IT 
IT'S LIKE RUNNING ON BURNING COALS 
I HATE LOSING 
THEIR GOAL TO COMPETE AGAINST THE TARAHUMARA SOME OF THE BEST NATURAL ENDURANCE RUNNERS IN THE WORLD 
OUR ATHLETES HAVE BEEN INVITED TO STAY IN A TARAHUMARA VILLAGE THAT HAS A LONG TRADITION OF RACING 
THIS IS IT MAN 
I'M JASON 
RAJKO BRAD 
MARK COREY RICARDO 
VICENTE HE'S THE CHIEF AHH 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
LA MESA DE LA HIERBABUENA IS AN ISOLATED COMMUNITY OF ONLY THIRTY HOMES 
BUT DESPITE THAT IT MANAGES TO FIELD TWO RIVAL RUNNING TEAMS 
REPRESENTING EITHER END OF THE VILLAGE 
MARK COREY AND JASON WILL BE LIVING AND COMPETING FOR THE LOWER VILLAGE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS 
THE OTHER ATHLETES ARE GOING TO BE STAYING HIGHER UP THE CANYON AND COMPETING FOR THE UPPER VILLAGE 
BRAD WILL BE LIVING WITH VICENTE THE VILLAGE CHIEF 
ME YOU YOU 
OUTSIDE 
THEY JUST MET ME AND UM FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THEY'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY LIKE ME 
THEY'RE JUST GONNA GIVE ME THE HOUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
WITH JUST EIGHT DAYS UNTIL THEY'RE DUE TO RACE OUR ATHLETES HAVE GOT TO PICK UP THE PACE 
AND IT'S RUNNING COACH MARIANO'S JOB TO KNOCK THEM INTO SHAPE 
O. K. 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
FIRST WE'LL LEARN TO KICK THE BALL AND AFTER WE LEARN TO KICK IT WE'LL LEARN TO RUN 
AND THEN WE'LL LEARN TO RUN AND KICK THE BALL 
YEAH 
THIS ISN'T WHAT OUR ATHLETES WERE EXPECTING THEY'LL BE TRAINING FOR THE GRUELLING CARERRA DE BOLA 
IT'S A LONG STANDING TRADITION IN WHICH TWO TEAMS RACE OVER A ROCKY MOUNTAIN COURSE 
KICKING A SMALL WOODEN BALL ALL THE WAY 
THAT WAS HORRIBLE 
NO MATTER HOW HARD I FOCUS I JUST CAN'T GET IT OFF THE GROUND 
IT'S HARD IT'S A LITTLE BIT PAINFUL ACTUALLY 
AND RUNNING AND DOING IT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE 
WE'RE ALL STRUGGLING SO THAT'S GOOD EXCEPT RICH HE THINKS HE'S GOOD THERE 
OH RICH 
OXFORD THEOLOGIAN RICHARD IS A COLLEGE ALL ROUNDER 
HE'S SOLID AT THE CREASE QUICK ON THE RUGBY FIELD AND NOT AT ALL BAD WITH A CROQUET MALLET 
I GIVE MY BEST SHOT THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TAUGHT 
MAYBE THAT'S THE ENGLISH WAY 
BUT TRIBES PLAY BY THEIR OWN RULES AND SO FAR RICHARD HAS BEEN PUMMELLED 
FIRST AGAINST KALAPALO WARRIORS IN BRAZIL 
THEN AGAINST ZULU STICK FIGHTERS 
DAMN RIGHT IT'S SCARY 
BUT ALTHOUGH COLLEGE BOY RICHARD MIGHT NOT LIKE FIGHTING 
AN ENDURANCE RACE COULD BE HIS CHANCE TO SHINE 
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A NEW SPORT THIS IS YOU KNOW 
THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE OF BUT MY STRENGTHS LEND THEMSELVES QUITE WELL TO IT 
OUR ATHLETES' BALL SKILLS ARE SO BAD 
THAT MARIANO ASKS LOCAL CHILDREN TO SHOW THEM HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE 
UNO DOS TRES 
UNFORTUNATELY THE REAL COMPETITION WILL BE FAR MORE THAN CHILD'S PLAY 
RIGHT NOW OUR ATHLETES HAVE NO IDEA JUST HOW LONG THE RACE IS GOING TO BE 
IN FACT THE CARERRA DE BOLA CAN LAST A WHOLE AGONISING DAY AND SOMETIMES MORE 
WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE BREATHING HARD 
BRAD'S ONE OF AMERICA'S TOP STRONG MEN 
I SEE MYSELF AS AN AVERAGE SIZED KID EVERYBODY ELSE WAS JUST SMALL 
AND SO FAR HE'S USED BRUTE POWER TO GOOD EFFECT 
WINNING IN BRAZIL 
THAT'S RIGHT I'M BRAD 
AND IMPRESSING ZULUS IN AFRICA 
MY GAME PLAN THE WHOLE TIME HAS BEEN INTIMIDATION I'M NOT LOSING 
BRAD COMPETES TO BE A SUPERHERO FOR HIS ONE YEAR OLD AMETHYST 
SINCE MY LITTLE ONE HAS BEEN BORN I'VE DEFINITELY BECOME A DIFFERENT PERSON 
BUT HIS STRENGTH ISN'T GOING TO HELP HIM RUN IN MEXICO 
NONE OF MY TRAINING INVOLVES ANY TYPE OF ENDURANCE 
THIS IS GONNA BE ME STEPPING INTO MY PERSONAL HELL 
BRAD HAS NO CHANCE 
HE WON'T MIND ME SAYING THAT 
AND JASON DOESN'T EITHER 
ENDURANCE HAS NEVER BEEN MY THING 
MARK'S A BIT OF AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY BECAUSE HE ALWAYS MAKES OUT LIKE HE'S NOT COMPETITIVE 
OR THAT YOU KNOW HE'S NOT THAT GOOD BUT IN ACTUAL FACT HE PROBABLY IS VERY GOOD 
I THINK THIS EVENT IS REALLY GONNA PLAY TO MY STRENGTHS 
BUT I STILL THINK THAT THE TOP THREE IS GONNA BE ME 
THEN COREY THEN RICHARD 
THE ATHLETES WILL RACE FOR THEIR VILLAGE TEAMS ALONGSIDE THE LOCALS 
AND MARIANO WANTS TO SEE IF THEY STAND ANY CHANCE OF COPING 
SO FAR ONLY ONE OF THEM HAS CAUGHT HIS EYE 
HARVARD SCIENTIST COREY IS NO STRENGTH ATHLETE 
AND HE'S CERTAINLY NOT A FIGHTER 
DAMN IT 
I THINK I'VE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THAT I'M PRETTY BIG PANSY WHEN IT COMES TO CONTACT SPORTS 
BUT THIS BUG SPECIALIST IS COMPLETELY AT HOME OUTDOORS IN THE NATURAL WORLD 
I WAS BORN IN ALASKA AND AS A RESULT THE MOUNTAINS AND NATURE ARE MY HOME 
THAT'S WHAT I CONNECT TO THAT HAS MADE ME EVERYTHING I AM TODAY 
ENDURANCE IS COREY'S SPECIALITY IF ANY EVENT 
IS TAILORED TO HIS SKILLS IT'S RUNNING AT ALTITUDE WITH THE TARAHUMARA 
IT'S MY EVENT IT'S ENDURANCE THAT'S WHAT I TRAIN FOR IN THE MOUNTAINS 
AND HERE WE ARE IN THE MOUNTAINS READY TO RUN 
TODAY'S TRAINING IS OVER AND IT'S LEFT OUR ATHLETES WITH A LOT TO THINK ABOUT 
WE WERE ALL THINKING THAT IT'S JUST GONNA BE A STRAIGHTFORWARD 
LONG DISTANCE RUN ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND IT'S TURNED OUT THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE 
AHH THIS IS GONNA BE A BITCH 
THAT'S DAMN NEAR AS FAR AS I'VE EVER RUN 
IT'S GONNA BE TRICKY KICKING THAT BALL AND RUNNING 
AND I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE HOW WE COULD DO IT 
ON ANYTHING THAT'S NOT FLAT GROUND OR GO UP A HILL WITH THAT BALL 
SO A BIT CONFUSING AT THE MOMENT 
IF RAJKO THOUGHT THAT WAS CONFUSING WAIT UNTIL HE FINDS OUT ABOUT 
ANOTHER ASPECT OF TARAHUMARA RUNNING THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE RACE EVEN TOUGHER FOR ALL OF THEM 
THE LOCALS WEAR HOMEMADE SANDALS 
CUT FROM OLD CAR TYRES 
AND GUESS WHAT OUR ATHLETES ARE GONNA HAVE TO WEAR THEM TOO 
THEY WEAVE THE LACES IN AND OUT OF THE SOLE A COUPLE OF TIMES 
TO MAKE A HEEL ON IT WHICH YOU PUT YOUR FOOT ON 
THEN YOU HAVE THIS REALLY LONG STRAP THAT COMES AROUND 
AND YOU JUST WRAP IT AROUND YOUR LEG OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
AH PERFECTO 
ON THE PLUS SIDE THE SANDALS ARE IDEAL FOR FLICKING THE WOODEN BALL 
ON THE MINUS SIDE THEY'RE GOING TO HURT QUITE A LOT 
I CAN'T REALLY SEE RUNNING A GREAT DISTANCE IN THESE THINGS MAN 
I'M HOPING THAT THE LEATHER GIVES A BIT MORE THAN WHAT IT DOES 
OTHERWISE IT'S GONNA BE A VERY PAINFUL RUN WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES 
WE'RE GONNA BE RUNNING UP HILLS 
THROUGH CREVICES 
ON ROCKS AND IN SANDALS 
KICKING THE BALL IN THE HEAT IN ALTITUDE NUTS 
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING 
THE MOST TALENTED YOUNG RUNNER IN THE VILLAGE IS FIFTEEN YEAR OLD LIRIO 
HE'S CAPTAIN OF THE UPPER VILLAGE TEAM 
LIRIO IS KEEN TO GET STRAIGHT INTO TRAINING WITH THE BALL AND THE SANDALS 
YEAH 
SO FAR I MEAN IT'S ONLY THE FIRST TWO HUNDRED METRES OR SO AND ALREADY 
IT'S STARTING TO TAKE ITS TOLL BUT THE BALL IS 
EH THE BALL'S LOOKING PROMISING WE'RE GOING AT QUITE A GOOD PACE 
IT'S ONLY A SHORT RUN BUT WITHIN MINUTES BRAD BEGINS TO STRUGGLE 
T. H. IS IS GREAT 
WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW GOOD I FEEL RIGHT NOW 
IT'S O. K. AT THIS PACE AS LONG AS THEY DON'T SPEED UP 
IT'S HARD KICKING IT THOUGH 
THE ROUTE ISN'T TOO BAD THOUGH IS IT IT'S PATHWAYS 
NOW IF IT WAS ACROSS GRASS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE 
UNFORTUNATELY RAJKO HAS ONLY SEEN A SMALL PART OF THE COURSE 
I TELL YOU I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA BLOODY RUN ON THIS LET ALONE KICK THE BALL 
JOKE ESPECIALLY IN SANDALS 
AS CAPTAIN OF THE LOWER VILLAGE MARIANO IS GIVING COREY MARK AND JASON A TOUR OF THE TRACK 
AND AS THEY REACH THE MOST DIFFICULT SECTION OF THE COURSE IT'S TIME FOR SOME HEALTH AND SAFETY 
WOW HOLY SHIT 
WHAT IS IT A SPIDER 
YEAH I KNOW IT'S A SPIDER 
WATCH OUT FOR THE POISONOUS SPIDERS TOO 
IT WAS FURTHER UP THERE IT DID SOUND PRETTY CLOSE 
OH YES AND DON'T FORGET THE RATTLESNAKES 
THIS WHOLE COURSE HAS GOT LIKE SPINES AND SPIKES AND CACTUSES AND ROCKS TO BREAK YOUR ANKLE ON 
AND POISONOUS SPIDERS I MEAN THIS ACTUALLY IS A COURSE I'M KINDA CONCERNED ABOUT 
ESPECIALLY THE ONES ON THE FLOOR YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW 
WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING WHERE THEY ARE YOU'LL NOT KNOW WHERE THE SNAKE IS 
WE WENT OUT RUNNING IN OUR SANDALS FOR THE FIRST TIME 
AND IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE SWINE 
IT WAS LIKE RUNNING IN FLIP FLOPS THROUGH MUD OVER ROCKS 
CAUSE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT THEY ARE 
BUT SAYING THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE 
MY FEET ARE A BIT BLISTERED 
BUT IT WASN'T WASN'T HORRIFIC IT WAS JUST BAD 
WE'RE GONNA BE RUNNING IN SOME OF THE MOST GRISLY SANDALS YOU'VE EVER SEEN 
OVER ROCKS AND MOUNTAINS WHICH ARE STEEPER THAN ANY HILL I'D NORMALLY RUN OVER 
IT'S A DAUNTING IT'S MORE THAN A DAUNTING PROSPECT IT'S TERRIFYING 
OUR ATHLETES WERE NEVER EXPECTING IT TO BE EASY BUT THE SNAKES THE SANDALS AND THAT LITTLE BALL 
WILL MAKE THIS AN EVENT THAT WILL PUSH THEM TO THEIR LIMITS AND SOME OF THEM BEYOND 
ALL THE ATHLETES ARE STAYING WITH FAMILIES IN THE VILLAGE 
AND THEY HAVE TO WORK TO REPAY THEM FOR THEIR HOSPITALITY 
I'M JUST HELPING MY HOST RAMON 
COLLECT THE CORN FROM THE FIELDS 
THERE'S A GREETING HERE CALLED QUERA 
QUERA IS A HELLO BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S SORT OF IT'S THE BASIS OF THEIR SOCIETY 
QUERA MEANS LET'S HELP EACH OTHER LET'S WORK FOR EACH OTHER YOU KNOW LET'S LIVE TOGETHER 
SO I'M SAYING TO RAMON THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE HOSPITALITY 
THANK YOU FOR FEEDING ME LET ME HELP YOU IN THE FIELD AND EARN MY WAY 
SOME OF THE NEWLY CUT MAIZE IS MADE INTO A BEER CALLED TESGUINO 
AND INSPIRED BY THE LASHINGS OF HOMEBREW RAJKO HAS A SURPRISE PARTY PLANNED 
WE'RE ABOUT TO GO AND CELEBRATE JASON'S TWENTY FIRST 
I'VE GOT A WHOLE THIRTY LITRE VAT OF BEER ON MY HEAD AND I HOPE I DON'T DROP IT 
DO WE HAVE ANYONE OF LEGAL AGE TO DRINK 
PARTY LET'S GET READY TO RUMBA 
THIRTY LITRES OF HOMEBREW WHO WANTS SOME HAPPY TWENTY FIRST 
THERE YOU GO OH MY GOD 
FIRST LEGAL SIP RIGHT HERE 
WOO WOO YEAH 
RAMON 
NOBODY SEEMS TO SIP A BEER QUIETLY HERE IT SEEMS TO BE DOWN IN ONE 
YEAH KEEP IT GOING KEEP IT GOING 
YOU GOT IT TO THE BOTTOM TO THE BOTTOM YEY 
IF I HAD TO RATE IT ON A ONE TO TEN SCALE OF THE DRINKS I'D PICK IT'D DEFINITELY BE A TWO 
BUT THIS WILL WORK FOR MY BIRTHDAY 
TREE SURGEON JASON'S THE YOUNGEST OF ALL THE ATHLETES 
A TROUBLED TEENAGER FROM A BROKEN HOME HE TURNED TO B. M. X. 
WE YOU KNOW WE GREW UP REAL ROUGH AND YOU KNOW FIGHTING IS FUN TO ME I LIKE TO FIGHT 
BUT JASON'S FIGHTING FAILED HIM IN BRAZIL 
AND HE WAS NERVOUS ABOUT TAKING ON THE ZULUS 
I'M JUST STARTING TO THINK THAT YOU KNOW I MIGHT NOT DO IT 
BEFORE HIS RAW AGGRESSION BROKE THROUGH TAKING HIM TO SECOND PLACE 
I DID GOOD MAN 
I WAS HAPPY WITH HOW I PERFORMED THAT DAY 
BUT THE BOY FIGHTER IS GROWING UP PLANNING TO SETTLE DOWN WITH HIS CHILDHOOD SWEETHEART 
JUST WANT TO BE HAPPY MAN 
FOR JASON THIS WHOLE JOURNEY IS ONE OF SELF DISCOVERY 
I'M GLAD WE WERE ABLE TO CELEBRATE JASON'S BIRTHDAY 
IT MEANT A LOT TO HIM AND IT MEANT A LOT TO ALL OF US AND HE SAID HE'LL NEVER FORGET IT SO THAT'S GREAT 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU 
THERE ARE JUST FOUR DAYS TO THE RACE AND A TROPICAL STORM IS BLOWING THROUGH THE CANYON 
MARIANO HAS HALTED TRAINING 
IN THE UPPER VILLAGE THERE IS NO SUCH CAUTION 
LIRIO HAS DECIDED TO RUN HIS TEAM RAGGED 
AND NOW HE'S JUST SHOWING OFF 
RUNNING OUT AHEAD OF HIS TEAM OVER THE MILE LONG COURSE LIRIO LEAVES THEM FOR DEAD 
I WON'T DENY IT WAS PURE EVIL 
I TRIED TO STAY UP WITH THEM BUT I COULDN'T TWO THINGS PARTICULARLY UPSET ME ABOUT THAT RUN 
ONE IS THAT HE IS TOTALLY NOT OUT OF BREATH AND NOR IS RICHARD THAT UPSETS ME GREATLY 
YEAH IT WAS GETTING PRETTY TOUGH THERE AND I THINK IF THAT'S THEIR SORT OF CRUISING PACE 
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA COPE 
I'M HOPING HE WAS REALLY SORT OF SHOWING WHAT HE CAN DO 
AND REALLY STRETCHING HIS LEGS BUT THEN HE LOOKS COMPLETELY UNFAZED 
HE'S SO LIGHT AND QUICK 
IT'S QUITE HARD PHEW 
ALL THE COMPETITORS ARE POWERFUL ATHLETES BUT RAJKO IS SOMETHING ELSE 
THE DUMBBELLS ARE TWENTY KILOS 
HIS STRENGTH WON HIM A WORLD RECORD 
THE RECORD I SET WAS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY CONSECUTIVE LIFTS 
AND RAJKO IS ALSO THE ULTIMATE ALL ROUNDER 
OBVIOUSLY I'LL HAVE GOOD ENDURANCE AND THAT WILL BE UPPER BODY AND LOWER BODY BECAUSE OF MY TRAINING 
HE'S ALREADY COME CLOSE TO WINNING IN THE FIRST TWO CONTESTS 
I REALLY FELT I WAS GONNA WIN THAT ONE 
I CAME THAT CLOSE TO WINNING 
AND NOW HE'S HOPING THAT HIS MENTAL STRENGTH WILL AT LAST BRING HIM OUT ON TOP 
THE TROPICAL STORM PASSES THROUGH AND OUR ATHLETES CARRY ON ACCLIMATIZING TO HIGH ALTITUDE 
BUT THEY STILL HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD JUST HOW LONG THE RACE IS GOING TO BE 
THEY KNOW IT'S A MILE LONG COURSE AROUND THE VILLAGE 
BUT NO ONE'S SAID HOW MANY LAPS THEY'LL BE DOING 
AND THE DAYS OF TRAINING HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL ON ONE OF THE FAVOURITES 
AN INJURY I THOUGHT I RECOVERED FROM A LONG TIME AGO HAS NOW COME BACK 
THE PROBLEM WITH SHIN SPLINTS IS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO RECOVER FROM IT IS JUST TO DO NOTHING PRETTY MUCH 
NOTHING ATHLETIC OTHER THAN LIKE POOL WORKOUTS AND STUFF 
SO THE FACT THAT IT'S SHOWING SIGNS THAT IT MAY BE RE AGGRAVATED IS PRETTY SERIOUS 
I WANT YOU TO GIVE IT A GO AND SEE HOW YOU GET ON COREY 
IF I WAS IN YOUR SHOES I'VE NEVER HAD SHIN SPLINTS BEFORE 
AND FROM WHAT YOU SAY IT SOUNDS FREAKING HORRIBLE BUT 
I WOULD AT LEAST START IT AND JUST RUN TILL O. K. THIS AIN'T GONNA WORK 
IT MIGHT WORK FOR YOU 
IT MIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
IT'S JUST TWO DAYS TO THE RACE AND COREY COULD BE OUT 
AND RAJKO HAS PROBLEMS TOO 
AH A BIT OF COBBLING GOING ON 
YEAH THE SANDALS 
JUST SLIP AROUND A LOT AND SO THIS IS MY 
FIRST PHASE OF TWO 
MY HOMEMADE SOLUTION FOR SOLVING THIS BLISTER PROBLEM 
OR INFECTING IT INFECTING IT POSSIBLY 
WATCH THIS PHASE TWO 
SUPERGLUE 
WHY ARE YOU SUPERGLUING YOUR FOOT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE 
IT'S TO TOUGHEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT 
THAT'S GENUINELY NOT SUPERGLUE IS IT OH SHUCKS IT'S ACTUALLY SUPERGLUE 
YEAH MY FINGERS ARE GONNA STICK TO IT IN A SECOND ISN'T THAT TOXIC PROBABLY HANG ON 
IT SHOULD MAKE THE SKIN TOUGHER WHEREVER I PUT IT ON 
IT STINGS ACTUALLY 
HA HA IT STINGS I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR FACE 
THIS IS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS 
IT SHOULD WORK THOUGH 
WHAT DOES IT SAY ON THE BACK OF THE SUPERGLUE THING 
DOES IT HAS ONE OF THOSE LIKE SKULL AND CROSSBONES THAT SAYS IT'S TOXIC 
CAN CAUSE SEVERE EYE INJURY INSTANTLY BONDS SKIN 
THAT'S ALL I NEED TO KNOW 
THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING THOUGH 
I MEAN IT SAYS LIKE WATCH OUT IT INSTANTLY BONDS SKIN IN A BAD WAY 
IN CASE OF SKIN BONDING QUICKLY FLUSH WATER AND AVOID QUICK QUICK QUICK 
WHILE RAJKO LETS HIS GLUE DRY IT'S THE LOWER VILLAGE'S FINAL PRACTICE SESSION 
AND COREY IS STILL WORKING HARD TO MAKE THE RACE ON SUNDAY 
I'M FEELING THAT MY TEAM'S REAL STRONG 
WE TOOK A TEST RUN AROUND THE COURSE AND WE DID REALLY GREAT 
I COULDN'T IMAGINE IT GOING MUCH BETTER THAN THAT 
EVERYBODY KNEW WHAT THEY HAD TO DO 
THE COMMUNICATION WAS THERE AND THAT'S WHAT BEING A GOOD TEAM IS ABOUT 
WELL DONE THAT WAS NICE 
BUT THE MOOD IS RATHER DIFFERENT IN THE UPPER VILLAGE 
RICHARD SUDDENLY STARTED THROWING UP 
INSTEAD OF TRAINING HE'S GONE TO BED MISSING OUT ON LIRIO'S SPECIAL BOOZE FUELLED FINAL SESSION 
ARE YOU SERIOUS WOO 
HE'S A SKILLED DRINKER HE IS 
RIGHT LET'S GO AND TRAIN 
WOO O. K. 
AND RICHARD'S ILLNESS ISN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM FACING THE UPPER VILLAGE TEAM 
SANDALS ARE UTTER SHIT 
I HATE THESE THINGS REALLY PAINFUL THEY KEEP SLIPPING OFF I CAN'T KICK THE BALL 
ARGH BOLLOCKS 
RAJKO MIGHT CLAIM SUPREME MENTAL STRENGTH BUT CLEARLY IT DOESN'T EXTEND TO HIS FEET 
I TRULY DESPISE THESE SANDALS 
DO YOU THINK IT'D BE EASIER BAREFOOT I WOULD SOONER CAN I GO BAREFOOT 
ARE YOU GONNA TRY TO PULL THAT OFF I JUST CAN'T TAKE THE PAIN IT'S A NIGHTMARE 
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR FOOT IS IT NOT GETTING YOUR FOOT HERE 
YEAH IT SUCKS BUT I KEEP THINKING IS I WOULD RATHER FEEL THE PAIN BETWEEN MY TOES THAN TO BE BAREFOOT 
NO I JUST CAN'T DO IT 
NAH 
IT'S SO UNCOMFORTABLE THAT IT'S REALLY IRRITATING ME NOW 
I WAS THINKING I'LL BE ALL RIGHT I'LL PUSH THROUGH BUT I CAN'T DO IT 
RAJKO RAJKO 
I'VE BEEN WORKING HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE 
BUT IT'S COMING DOWN TO ONE SIMPLE FACT IS I CAN'T RUN IN THESE SANDALS IT'S JUST TOO PAINFUL 
AND I I DUNNO I DON'T THINK I COULD DO IT 
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO COME DOWN TO WHO CAN WEAR SOME SHITTY LITTLE SANDALS 
I NEVER WEAR THOSE STUPID SANDALS THAT HAVE THE THING THAT GOES IN BETWEEN YOUR FIRST TWO TOES 
WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM THONGS BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HATED THEM 
AND NOW I HAVE TO NOT ONLY WEAR THEM BUT RUN IN THEM 
SUDDENLY IT'S ALL GONE TOPSY TURVY AS THE THREE FAVOURITES HIT TROUBLE 
COREY'S INJURED RAJKO IS IN SANDAL HELL AND RICHARD'S DAY IS GOING FROM BAD TO WORSE 
THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST PREPARATION I COULD POSSIBLY HAVE 
I FEEL REALLY SICK AND I'VE GOT A PRETTY CHRONIC CASE OF THE RUNS 
AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THESE GUYS ARE JUST SINGING LOUDER AND LOUDER 
IT'S ABOUT THREE IN THE MORNING 
I FEEL REALLY SICK I'VE BEEN TO THE LOO ABOUT FIVE TIMES ALREADY TONIGHT 
AND THESE GUYS JUST KEEP ON DRINKING 
IT'S NOW ABOUT FIVE THIRTY IN THE MORNING 
AND AS YOU CAN HEAR THEY'VE JUST STARTED SINGING 
COULD BE ONE OF THE WORST NIGHTS OF MY LIFE 
THE RACE IS TOMORROW AND THE CEREMONIES ARE ALREADY BEGINNING 
A COW IS SACRIFICED TO PROVIDE MEAT FOR THE RUNNERS 
THE FIRST BLOOD IS OFFERED UP TO THE GODS 
FOR THE TARAHUMARA THE RACE EVEN THE BALL IS SACRED 
AFTER A TOUGH WEEK BRAD AND JASON ARE RESTING BEFORE THE CHALLENGE OF THE RACE 
AND WITH RAJKO COREY AND RICHARD ALL IN TROUBLE BIRMINGHAM PROVIDES AN UNEXPECTED FAVOURITE 
THINGS HAVE REALLY GONE MY WAY THIS WEEK IN A WAY THAT THEY'VE NEVER NORMALLY GONE BEFORE 
LIKE RAJKO WOULD NORMALLY BE IN THE FAVOURITES AND FOR SOME REASON HE'S HAD PROBLEMS WITH HIS SANDALS 
RICHARD FELL ILL TWO DAYS AGO 
COREY'S GOT PROBLEMS WITH HIS SHINS 
SO THE GUYS WHO WERE IN THE TOP THREE WHO WOULD RUN AWAY WITH IT 
THEY'VE GOT PROBLEMS 
SO I DON'T THINK I WILL WIN IT BUT I THINK IT'S SORT OF RAISED MY CHANCES 
WHICH IS MAYBE WHY I'VE GONE FROM BEING A NOBODY INTO BEING SOMEONE THAT CAN PROBABLY WIN IT 
MARK'S DANCING SKILLS WON'T HELP MUCH IN MEXICO 
BUT HIS KICK BOXING TRAINING DOES MAKE HIM A CONTENDER 
KICK BOXING MAKES YOU STRONGER MAKES YOU FASTER MAKES YOU REACT QUICKER 
HIS STRENGTH WASN'T ENOUGH IN BRAZIL 
BUT HIS SPEED WAS ON SHOW IN AFRICA 
STICK FIGHTING PROVED TO ME THAT IF I 
HIS MARTIAL ARTS SKILLS TOOK HIM TO A WIN 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE PROUDEST MOMENTS OF MY LIFE 
NOW IN MEXICO HE'S OUT FOR TWO IN A ROW 
BUT THE FAVOURITES ARE NOT ABOUT TO GIVE UP 
THE SUPERGLUE DIDN'T WORK BUT RAJKO HAS ANOTHER DAFT PLAN 
I'VE COMPLETELY ERADICATED THE THONG AND I HAVE TAPED MY FOOT DIRECTLY TO THE SANDAL 
THAT'S QUITE COMFORTABLE 
YEAH BACK IN THE GAME 
MEANWHILE COREY DESPERATE TO DEAL WITH HIS INJURY HAS TURNED TO THE SHAMAN 
HE SAID IT'S ONLY FOUND UP HIGH BECAUSE OF THE COOLER CLIMATE 
IT'S NOT FOUND DOWN HERE SO WE'VE GOT TO HIKE A WAYS UP BUT THEN IT'S UNCLEAR HOW FAR WE HAVE TO GO 
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE MESCAL CACTUS A POWERFUL ANAESTHETIC 
CONSIDERING MY LEG'S IN A LOT OF PAIN ANYTHING TO HELP IT WILL BE MUCH OBLIGED 
EVEN RICHARD SEEMS TO BE ON THE MEND 
RICH HOW ARE YOU FEELING MY FRIEND 
FEELING FEELING IT'S TOTALLY BETTER 
I NEED TO EAT SOME FOOD I THINK SEEING AS I HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING FOR ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
IT TURNS OUT HE'S IN LUCK 
ON THE EVE OF THE RACE ALL THE RUNNERS ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER TO EAT THE MEAT OF THE SACRIFICED COW 
IT TASTES REALLY GOOD JUST ENOUGH SALT 
NOT MUCH FAT ON THE MEAT 
IT DOESN'T GET FRESHER THAN THIS REALLY GOOD 
BUT THERE'S A BIG MOMENT COMING 
TRADITION DICTATES THAT IT'S NOW THAT THE LENGTH OF THE RACE IS ANNOUNCED 
A JOB THAT FALLS TO VICENTE THE CHIEF 
I THINK HE SAID WE'RE GOING AROUND THE COURSE TWENTY SEVEN TIMES 
TWENTY SEVEN TIMES 
DO YOU WANT TO DOUBLE CHECK 
IT DEPENDS HOW LONG THE COURSE IS 
TWENTY SEVEN MILES IN SANDALS UH 
WE KNOW HOW LONG THE COURSE IS HOW LONG AT LEAST A MILE 
IT'S ALMOST EXACTLY MARATHON LENGTH THEN RUNNING A MARATHON IN THE MOUNTAINS 
IF YOU PUT ON A PAIR OF TRAINERS COULD YOU RUN THE LONDON MARATHON 
ABSOLUTELY NOT WE'RE IN SANDALS 
WE'RE FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET IN THE AIR 
TAKE AWAY MY SHOES TAKE AWAY THE FLAT GROUND TAKE AWAY TAKE AWAY THE LINES OF SUPPORTERS 
SO IT'S LITERALLY THE LAST MAN STANDING ISN'T IT 
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA FINISH IT 
IT IS YEAH IT'S LAST MAN STANDING IT'S WHOEVER'S STILL GOING 
NO WAY NO THAT'S CRAZY 
BLOODY HELL I'M FEELING NERVOUS NOW I THINK WE'RE ALL FEELING REALLY QUITE NERVOUS 
IT'S KIND OF NERVOUS AND EXCITED BUT IT'S EXCITED 
IN A BIT OF A SADISTIC WAY BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE CRAZY 
IT'S A LONG ROUGH COURSE IT'S GONNA BE HARD PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE HURT 
PEOPLE ARE GONNA CRY PEOPLE ARE GONNA 
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY MAN IT'S HARD CORE 
TODAY'S GONNA BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO ANYTHING THAT ANY OF US HAVE EVER BEEN THROUGH BEFORE 
THIS IS SO FAR BEYOND BEING JUST A LONG DISTANCE THIS IS FIFTY ONE KILOMETRES 
IT'S UPHILL OVER ROCKS AND JAGGED TERRAIN 
AND IT'S IN SANDALS WHICH ARE ONLY BARELY BETTER THAN RUNNING ACROSS HOT COALS IN BARE FEET 
IT'S GONNA BE SERIOUSLY PAINFUL TODAY 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RACING BUT I'M ANXIOUS 
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT MY ADRENALINE'S BEEN PUMPING FOR ABOUT 
SIX HOURS NOW 
I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO RUNNING AT ALL 
THE ONLY THING I DO LOOK FORWARD TO IS TO FIND OUT WHAT I HAVE IN MYSELF 
AND TODAY IS DEFINITELY GONNA BE MY GREATEST OBSTACLE TO OVERCOME 
ALL LAST NIGHT I WAS JUST TELLING MYSELF YOU CAN'T WIN THIS 
DON'T TRY TO WIN THIS YOU'RE NOT GONNA WIN THIS 
IF I THINK THAT I HAVE A CHANCE I MIGHT GO FOR IT AND BE STUPID AND HURT MYSELF 
SO IT'S A REALLY TOUGH THING FOR ME TO DEAL WITH 
BUT I JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT TODAY THIS IS NOT MY RACE 
IF THERE'S ONE EVENT THAT REALLY SHOWS ATHLETICISM 
WILL AND DETERMINATION IT'S THIS ONE 
AND IF I CAN WIN THIS ONE I'VE PROVED A LOT TO MYSELF 
LOTS OF THOUGHTS RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD 
HOW MY KNEE'S GONNA COPE HOW ARE MY FEET GONNA COPE 
I BELIEVE I HAVE THE FITNESS AND I BELIEVE I HAVE THE MENTAL STRENGTH 
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHETHER MY BODY 
CAN COPE WITH SOMETHING THAT'S THAT DIFFERENT AND THAT FAR 
WITH THE RACE ABOUT TO START THE SHAMAN DELIVERS HIS BLESSING TO THE RUNNERS AND THE BALL 
ON PAPER IT'S A TEAM RACE 
BRAD RAJKO AND RICHARD WITH THE UPPER VILLAGE 
MARK COREY AND JASON WITH THE LOWER VILLAGE 
BUT IN REALITY ALL SIX ARE COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BE THE LAST MAN STANDING 
OUR TEAM WAS INCREDIBLY FAST 
THEY WERE SHOOTING OFF WITH THE BALL 
SO THE BEST WE COULD DO WAS JUST KEEP THEM IN EYESIGHT 
AND SO RICH AND I DID THAT WE STAYED WITH THEM 
AND BRAD I THINK JUST HAD TO RUN HIS OWN RACE 
I ALREADY CAN'T BREATHE 
IT'S ONLY THE FIRST LAP 
RIGHT AFTER THAT FIRST LAP REALITY SET IN 
MY BODY WAS SAYING I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS 
THEN MY MIND TOOK OVER AND SAID WE'LL MAKE THIS HAPPEN LET'S DO IT 
NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU'RE HURTING DO IT 
OUR TEAM'S DOING GOOD WE'RE KEEPING A NICE SOLID PACE WE'RE ON A PACE TO FINISH 
I THINK THE OTHERS ARE ON AN INDIVIDUAL PACE TO WIN WE'RE ON A TEAM PACE TO FINISH THE WHOLE RACE 
ME COREY AND JASON KEPT TO OUR TACTICS OF JUST TAKING IT EASY PLAYING TORTOISE AND THE HARE 
WE KNEW RAJKO AND RICHARD 
WOULD JUST HEAD OFF WHICH JUST PLAYED 
WE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
I SEEN RICHARD AND RAJKO BLASTING OFF 
AT MAXIMUM PACE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO RUN A MARATHON THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS 
AND I FIGURED HEY YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST GONNA KEEP RUNNING THIS 
PACE AND EVENTUALLY THEIR BODY'S NOT GONNA ALLOW THEM TO GO ANY FURTHER 
SURE ENOUGH JUST THREE LAPS IN AND RAJKO IS SUFFERING 
BY THE THIRD LAP I WAS THINKING IF THIS GETS PROGRESSIVELY HARDER 
AS IT SEEMS TO BE 
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA LAST A QUARTER OF IT 
IT'S GETTING HARDER EVERY LAP I'M JUST TRYING 
TO KEEP MY TEMPERATURE DOWN 
HE WAS BREATHING VERY HEAVILY 
AND I THINK HE WAS FINDING IT QUITE TOUGH SO AT THAT POINT THE RACE WAS REALLY MINE TO WIN 
RICHARD PULLS OUT A LEAD LEAVING RAJKO BEHIND 
HALF A MILE BACK COREY AND HIS TEAM ARE PACING THEMSELVES 
REAL CAREFUL ON THIS PART GUYS 
DON'T WASTE ENERGY RUNNING 
BUT THE RACE IS ABOUT TO CLAIM ITS FIRST VICTIM 
TAKE A DRINK MARK 
GO FOR IT JUST GO FOR IT 
MARK'S STILL IN 
IT'S COREY WHO'S OUT 
THE PAIN IN HIS SHINS HAS BECOME UNBEARABLE 
ONCE IT REALLY STARTED THROBBING A LOT I HAD TO LEAVE 
AND IT WAS REALLY TOUGH FOR ME TO DO THAT 
BUT I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR ME TO LEAVE 
IT'S NOT JUST SKIING IT'S MOUNTAINEERING IT'S HIKING 
IT'S EVERYTHING THAT I LOVE ABOUT ATHLETICS THAT I COULD LOSE BY BEING STUPID HERE 
WITH COREY OUT STRONGMAN BRAD TAKES UP FIFTH PLACE 
OH 
MY BODY WAS SHUTTING DOWN I KEPT TELLING MY BODY TO KEEP GOING AND IT WAS NOT RESPONDING 
I COULDN'T BREATHE 
MY BODY WANTS TO GIVE UP 
I CAN'T LISTEN TO IT 
BRAD WAS A TRUE INSPIRATION 
BECAUSE TO SEE HIM JUST YOU KNOW THROUGH VOMITING AND THROUGH THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE WAS JUST 
YOU KNOW THE ESSENCE OF PAIN 
LIKE IT WAS JUST SO INCREDIBLE TO SEE HIM GO THAT FAR 
BUT AFTER FIVE LAPS FURTHER THAN HE'S EVER RUN BEFORE BRAD'S RACE IS OVER 
I WANTED TO SEE HOW FAR I COULD PUSH MYSELF AND SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN 
I KEPT COMPARING THIS TO GOING THROUGH MY OWN PERSONAL HELL YOU KNOW 
BUT I LOST MY BATTLE 
MY DAUGHTER AMETHYST 
I WANT HER TO BE PROUD OF ME 
I FAILED 
TEAM WISE LIRIO'S UPPER VILLAGE SIDE HAS OPENED UP A MASSIVE LEAD AND IT'S GROWING BY THE SECOND 
AS THE LOWER VILLAGE SEARCHES FOR A LOST BALL 
AS FOR OUR FOUR REMAINING ATHLETES RICHARD IS STILL LEADING RAJKO 
WITH A LONG GAP TO MARK AND THEN FINALLY JASON 
I'M REALLY OUT OF BREATH I'M STARTING TO GET DIZZY 
TRYING TO STAY FOCUSED KEEP MY LEGS GOING NO MATTER HOW FAST IT IS 
SO I'M RUNNING AND EVENTUALLY I END UP CATCHING UP TO MY OWN TEAM 
COS THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR THE BALL COS THEY HAD LOST IT IN SOME ROCKS 
WITH THE LOWER VILLAGE TEAM AT A STANDSTILL LIRIO AND THE UPPER VILLAGE PASS BY 
A WHOLE LAP AHEAD 
FINALLY WE FIND THE BALL WE START KICKING IT AGAIN AND WE'RE OFF 
KEEP IT UP MAN KEEP SOLID 
RICHARD STILL THE LEADING ATHLETE PRESSES ON 
I JUST TRIED TO GET A GOOD PACE GOING MY OWN PACE 
AND TRIED TO STAY UP WITH THE MAIN THRONG OF THE LOCAL RUNNERS 
BUT DON'T BE FOOLED BY THAT COMFORTABLE JOG BECAUSE THOSE SANDALS ARE REALLY STARTING TO BITE 
I HAVE THREE QUITE BAD BLISTERS ON MY LEFT FOOT 
I'M JUST TRYING TO TAKE MY MIND OFF IT 
BLISTERS STARTED TO GROW OUT THE BOTTOM OF MY FEET AND THEY GOT PRETTY BAD VERY QUICKLY 
AT ONE POINT ONE HEARD RICH SAY YOU KNOW I NEED SOME HELP 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT FOR BUT IT GAVE ME A CLUE THAT HE WAS SUFFERING 
AND IN A WAY THAT WAS KIND OF COMFORTING FOR ME BECAUSE I WAS SUFFERING LIKE HELL 
BUT WHEN YOU'RE COMPETING AGAINST OTHERS YOU DON'T WANT THEM 
TO KNOW HOW MUCH YOU'RE SUFFERING COS THAT KIND OF SPURS THEM ON 
RICHARD'S FORCED TO STOP FOR TREATMENT JOINING MARK WHO'S ALSO SUFFERING 
MY BLISTERS 
AH 
AHH 
BY THE TIME RICHARD REJOINS THE RACE RAJKO HAS PUSHED WELL INTO THE LEAD 
FEELING GOOD BECAUSE I'M INTO A STEADY PACE AHEAD OF THE OTHERS 
ON THE OTHER HAND I DON'T THINK I'M EVEN A QUARTER OF THE WAY THROUGH 
AS THE RACE GOES ON RAJKO'S EFFORT TO BREAK AWAY EVENTUALLY TAKES ITS TOLL 
I JUST NEVER TRAINED THIS LONG THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
NOW MY JOINTS ARE HURTING 
RIDICULOUS PAIN WITH BLISTERS 
JUST GOT TO KIND OF 
PRETEND IT DOESN'T HURT BUT IT'S DIFFICULT 
IT STARTED TO GET REALLY UNPLEASANT 
I JUST STARTED TO GET ONE BIG BLISTER ACROSS THE WHOLE OF THE BASE OF MY FOOT 
AND ANY TIME YOU KIND OF CHANGED DIRECTION YOU'D FEEL THE WHOLE SHIFT 
AND IT'S NOT ONLY A SICK FEELING BUT IT'S REALLY PAINFUL 
SO I HAD TO REALLY DIG IN BECAUSE EVERYTHING STARTED TO FAIL 
JASON MEANWHILE IS STILL PACING HIMSELF 
I'M LOOKING AT MY OTHER COMPETITORS AND THEY'RE ALL REALLY STARTING TO LOOK BEAT UP AND WORN DOWN 
AND JUST MENTALLY LOOKING LIKE TRASH 
AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF MAN YOU REALLY GOT A CHANCE TO PROVE THESE PEOPLE WRONG 
I'VE JUST GOTTA KEEP RUNNING JUST KEEP RUNNING TILL TOMORROW MAN 
SEE IF I COULD JUST NEVER STOP 
JASON'S STRATEGY COULD BE PAYING OFF BECAUSE RICHARD IS ALSO PAYING THE PRICE FOR HIS EARLY PACE 
A LOT OF IT WAS A VERY ISOLATED RACE 
I WAS RUNNING COMPLETELY ON MY OWN 
IT WAS BASICALLY A BATTLE AGAINST THE PAIN REALLY 
NEVER BEEN IN THIS MUCH PAIN IN MY FEET 
THEY'RE JUST 
YOU KNOW THEY'VE GONE FROM EXTREME PAIN TO UNUSUAL PAIN 
IT'S HORRIBLE ACTUALLY 
I'VE VERY RARELY FELT PAIN THAT BADLY 
I MEAN RIGHT UP UNTIL I JUST COULDN'T RUN ANY FURTHER COS IT WAS TOO AGONISING 
AFTER NINE LAPS AND THREE HOURS OF AGONY RICHARD'S GRIT IS NO LONGER ENOUGH 
HE LOSES HIS BATTLE WITH THE SANDALS 
IT WAS A REALLY BITTER EXPERIENCE AND I DON'T THINK 
I COULD HAVE CARRIED ON RUNNING WITHOUT PAIN WITHOUT SORT OF HAVING TO CRAWL 
YOU RAN A GREAT RACE MAN 
ONLY THREE OF OUR ATHLETES ARE LEFT IN THE RACE 
RAJKO IS NEARLY TWO LAPS IN THE LEAD 
BUT IS ALMOST DEAD ON HIS FEET 
I FEEL THE WHOLE 
BASE OF MY FOOT SLIPPING AROUND LIKE ONE MASSIVE BLISTER 
I FELT LIKE CRYING ON THE LAST LAP 
BUT I JUST CAN'T 
DON'T WANT TO STOP 
WITH RICHARD OUT MARK'S RUNNING STRONGLY IN SECOND PLACE 
AND JASON'S CONTINUING FURTHER BACK 
BOTH ARE CLOSING ON RAJKO 
I FEEL LIKE A CHAMPION HERE 
I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD MAKE IT THIS FAR 
IT JUST PROVES MAN 
BE POSITIVE AND KEEP GOING LIKE FORREST GUMP 
BUT WHEN LIRIO'S UPPER VILLAGE SQUAD LAPS THE LOWER VILLAGE TEAM FOR A SECOND TIME 
OUR RUNNERS DISCOVER WHAT A CRUEL MISTRESS THE CARERRA DE BOLA CAN BE 
OUR TEAM LAPPED THE OTHER TEAM TWICE 
SO THEY FIGURED SCREW IT YOU KNOW 
WE CAN GO TO SLEEP IT'LL TAKE THEM FOREVER TO CATCH UP WITH US IT'S GONNA TAKE THEM SO LONG TO CATCH UP 
WITH US THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN FINISH WE WON GAME OVER 
MARIANO THE LOWER VILLAGE TRAINER ADMITS DEFEAT AND STOPS THE RACE 
MARK AND JASON HAVE BEEN SLOWLY GAINING ON RAJKO BUT NOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO CATCH HIM 
WHO KNOWS THE RULES AROUND HERE 
DON'T TOUCH ME NOBODY TOUCH ME 
OUR TEAM LAPPED YOUR TEAM TWICE 
SO AS SOON AS THEY LAPPED LIRIO SAID WHAT'S THE POINT OF RUNNING ANY MORE 
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO CATCH US SO GAME OVER 
SO THE RACE OFFICIAL GAVE IT TO OUR TEAM 
I'M GONNA KILL SOMEBODY 
IT WAS LIKE I WANTED TO RIP SOMEBODY'S HEAD OFF 
WHAT CAN YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE TAKEN OUT AND YOU'RE STILL IN THE RACE 
AND I WAS STILL GOING LIKE I WAS TOLD AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I LOST NO MAN THAT SUCKS 
HE DOESN'T KNOW IT BUT AS THE LEADING ATHLETE WHEN THE RACE WAS STOPPED 
RAJKO IS DECLARED THE WINNER 
MY KNEES MY CALVES 
THE WHOLE OF MY FEET 
MY NECK PROBABLY BECAUSE I'VE BEEN RUNNING LIKE A HUNCHBACK 
HE IS THE LAST MAN STANDING 
WELL DONE MAN 
IS THAT IT WAY TO GO MAN THAT'S IT 
YOU'RE DONE 
YEAH 
HOW YOU DOING 
THAT WAS EMOTIONAL YEAH REALLY 
AND THE LAP BEFORE THAT I WAS ALMOST CRYING AS I WAS RUNNING IT WAS SO UNPLEASANT 
YOU DID IT IT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW MUCH MENTAL CONTROL HE REALLY HAS 
JUST THAT DETERMINATION RAJKO HAD WAS PHENOMENAL I MEAN PHENOMENAL 
HOW YOU FEELING 
NEXT TIME ON LAST MAN STANDING 
OUR ATHLETES GO TO NORTHERN INDIA TO KICK FIGHT WITH A TRIBE OF HEAD HUNTERS 
THE DAO THAT I WAS USING ACTUALLY CHOPPED A PERSON'S HEAD OFF 
IT'S HURT OR BE HURT 
REALLY SMASHED THE BACK OF THE HEEL 
AND NOW I'VE GOT EXCRUCIATING PAIN 
JASON HAS AN AGGRESSION PROBLEM 
ITS A BEAUTIFUL WEAPON 
FOR THE FIRST TIME I THINK ONE OF US CAN WIN THIS CONTEST COME ON 
THEY WERE CHANTING LIKE JASON THE LAZY 
FINISH IT THEY'RE NOT CHANTING THAT ANY MORE 
YEAH
