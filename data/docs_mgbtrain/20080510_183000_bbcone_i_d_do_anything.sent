TRIED YOUR BEST AND IT JUST WASN'T 
WHAT YOU ARE BEST AT DOING FRANKLY 
YOU ARE UNEASY IN THE SHOES AND THE 
DRESS BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO 
WITH YOUR TALENT IT IS THE WRONG 
SONG FOR YOU

TALENT COMPETITION BUT IN THE SAINT

IN THE PLAY YOU RUSH ACROSS THE 
STAGE AND YOU DIG YOUR NAILS INTO 
BILL SYKES AND YOU SAY I WILL PUT 
MY MARK ON YOU BILL AND IP DON'T 
CARE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES AND IT 
IS HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE THAT I I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IN A SONG LIKE 
TRUE COLOURS I COULDN'T HAVE 
GIVER THAN LINE 
I UNDERSTAND THAT 
JOHN 
I THINK YOU SHOWED WARMTH JOHN I'M NOT SURE ABOUT A MATERNAL 
INSTINCT IT WAS AN INTROSPECTIVE

MISSION TOMORROW THIS GIRL HAS 
AGGRESSION SHE COULD PUT HER MARK

YOUR VOCAL BUT YOU ARE SIMILAR TO 
CELINE IN THAT YOU ARE SLIECTS BUT 
YOU ARE A POWERHOUSE YOU HAVE A 
FANTASTIC STAGE PRESENCE AND YOU
