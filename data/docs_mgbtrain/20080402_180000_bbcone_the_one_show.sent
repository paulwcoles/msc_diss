HELLO WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW IF 
ONE FIESTY WOMAN WASN'T ENOUGH 
JANET STREET PORTER IS HERE TOO 
NEXT TO HER OUR HISTORY MAN BIG 
DAN SNOW DAN MIGHT BE BIG AND 
STRONG BUT NOW WE KNOW HE'S NOT 
BIGGLES BIGGLES OH OH 
TO BE FAIR TO THE LAD HE WAS GOING 
AT TWICE THE SPEED OF SOUND OR 
SOMETHING AT THE TIME ARE YOU OVER 
IT NOW 
I'M OVER IT NOW BUT IT WAS 
WORTH IT WORTH IT 
I HOPE YOU 
BREAKFASTED LIGHTLY THAT MORNING 
BUT SPARE US THE DETAILS 
AND WE'RE LIVE AT THE TRAFFORD 
CENTRE IN MANCHESTER AND TOOTH 
PATROL JUSTIN 
I KNOW I LOOK DREADFUL BUT I HOPE YOU REALISE THESE ARE NOT MEIGH 
REAL TEETH THESE ARE WHAT THE 
EXPERTS THINK MY TEETH WOULD LOOK 
LIKE IF I DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF THEM 
IT'S NOT A PRETTY SIGHT BUT THE 
TRUTH IS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HERE 
IN BRITAIN HAVE HAD PROBLEMS 
SIGNING UP TO AN N. H. S. DENTIST WE'VE 
COME HERE TO THE TRAFFORD CENTRE TO 
OFFER PEOPLE A FREE DENTAL CHECK UP 
COURTESY OF THE ONE SHOW WE'VE 
SEEN SHOCKING TEETH TODAY BUT NONE 
AS SHOCKING AS THE TEETH YOU'RE 
ABOUT TO SEE I'VE BEEN TALKING TO 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD SUCH PROBLEMS 
FINDING A DENTIST THEY'VE DECIDED 
TO LITERALLY TAKE MATTERS INTO 
THEIR OWN HANDS 
DESPITE QUEUING 
ROUND THE BLOCK MORE THAN SEVEN 
MILLION PEOPLE HAVE HAD 
DIFFICULTIES REGISTERING WITH AN 
N. H. S. DENTIST NEARLY THREE MILLION 
HAVE GONE WITHOUT TREATMENT AS A 
RESULT RESULT IN SOME PARTS OF BRITAIN FINDING AN 
N. H. S. DENTIST CAN BE LIKE PULLING 
TEETH WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU HAVE A 
TOOTHACHE BUT NO DENTIST SHOCKING 
AS IT SOUNDS SOME PEOPLE ARE 
TAKING MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS 
AND PRACTISING A BIT OF DIY 
DENTISTRY DENTISTRY VALLEY HOLDS WORTH HIT THE 
HEADLINES WHEN SHE CONFRONTED TONY 
BLAIR ABOUT THE LACK OF IN IN 
DENTISTS WHERE SHE LIVES IN 
SCARBOROUGH 
THE TOOTH CAME LOST I SCARBOROUGH WAS IN REAL PAIN L. COULDN'T DRINK 
OR EAT EVEN SOMETHING WARM I 
COULDN'T DRINK L. TRIED TO GET TO A 
DENTIST BUT I COULDN'T GET ONE 
VALERIE USED TO HAVE AN N. H. S. DENTIST 
BUT LOST HER PLACE AFTER FAILING TO 
REREGISTER IT STILL ISN'T EASY TO 
GET AN N. H. S. DENTIST IN SCARBOROUGH 
THOUGH THERE'S NOW WAITING LIST 
YOU CAN JOIN VALERIE HAS NO REGRETS 
ABOUT THE DRASTIC ACTION SHE TOOK 
SHOW US WHAT YOU DID 
THAT'S HORRIFIC YOU PUT IT ROUND 
THE TOOTH 
I TURNED IT THE PAIN 
WAS GETTING WORSE L. L. THOUGHT IT 
COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE L. TURNED IT 
A BIT MORE AND IT CAME OUT L. TOOK 
SEVEN OUT ALTOGETHER 
TAKING SEVEN 
TEETH OUT WITH A PAIR OF PLIERS IS 
PRETTY EXTREME BUT A RECENT SURVEY 
SUGGESTS THAT THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF US ARE 
CURRENTLY WITHOUT DENTAL CARE 
YOU'VE BEEN A DENTIST FOR FORTY YEARS 
DID YOU EXPECT WHEN YOU CAME INTO 
DENTISTRY THAT YOU WOULD SEE DIY 
DENTISTRY FORTY YEARS ON 
NO I'M 
APPALLED BY IT YOU COULDN'T 
IMAGINE IT WOULD HAPPEN 
WHAT ARE 
THE RISKS OF DOING IT YOURSELF 
FIXING IT USING SUPER GLUE THEY 
COULD STICK THEIR TEETH THE WRONG 
WAY OR STICK THEIR LIPS TOGETHER 
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT PULLING OUT 
YOUR TEETH WITH PLIERS OR FIXING 
YOUR CROWNS WITH SUPER GLUE SHOULD 
CARRY A HEALTH WARNING BUT THERE 
WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE HAD NO 
CHOICE BUT TO BE DIY DENTISTS AS 
I'M ABOUT TO DISCOVER 
THE BRITISH DENTAL ASSOCIATION'S 
MUSEUM IS A REMINDER OF JUST HOW 
RUDIMENTARY THE ART OF LOOKING 
AFTER YOUR NASHERS ONCE WERE YOU YOU HAD A NUMBER OF OPTIONS YOU COULD 
GO TO YOUR BLACKSMITH IN YOUR 
VILLAGE WHO WOULD USE PLIERS 
A SECOND CHOICE IS TO GO TO A 
MARKET OR AGRICULTURAL FAIR WHERE 
YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND A TOOTH DRAWER 
WHO P. FRONT OF A CROWD WOULD DO IT 
ONE IN TENT TEN WOULD DIE OF 
COMPLICATIONS COMPLICATIONS NO ONE IS SUGGESTING THAT THINGS 
WILL GET THIS BAD AGAIN BUT IN 
ORDER TO FIND OUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN 
IF PEOPLE STOP GOING TO THE DENTIST 
I'VE COME TO THE SPECIAL EFFECTS 
LAB TO SEE WHAT OUR TOOTH COULD 
LOOK LIKE IF WE RESORT TO DIY 
DENTISTRY DENTISTRY ONE OF THE GREATEST STARS ON EARTH 
COLIN IS AN EXPERT IN ENSURING THE 
AUTHENTICITY OF MULTI MILLION POUND 
FILMS AND DRAMAS IS NOT LET DOWN BY 
AN ACTOR'S HOLLYWOOD SMILE DO THEY 
COME IN HERE LOOKING BEAUTIFUL AND 
YOU MAKE THEM LOOK UGLY 
YOU DON'T 
LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU'RE LEAVING 
COLIN AND HIS TEAM ARE GOING TO 
MAKE AN IMPRESSION OF MY TEETH SO 
THEY CAN SHOW ME HOW THEY MIGHT 
HAVE LOOKED IN VICTORIAN TIMES 
RELAX NOW 
THAT'S MY TEETH 
THAT'S THE PERFECT REPRODUCTION OF 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO FILL OVER THE 
TOP THE REVEAL WILL BE IN A MOMENT 
THE MYSTERY DEEPENS SIXTY YEARS ON 
FROM THE ADVENT OF THE NATIONAL 
HEALTH SERVICE AND THE AVAILABILITY 
OF N. H. S. DENTISTS IS STILL A PROBLEM 
IF WE CONTINUE TO USE DIY DENTAL 
METHODS WE MIGHT JUST END UP WITH 
TEETH LIKE OUR ANCESTORS 
THIS IS MY TEETH AND COLIN HAS BEEN 
MAKING ME SOME NEW TEETH BASED ON 
HISTORICAL RECORDS AT THE TIME 
WHICH SHOULD MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A 
VICTORIAN MAN 
WHO HAS BADLY NEGLECTED HIS TEETH 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW 
MUCH IT CHANGES MY APPEARANCE 
VERY SNUG 
OH MY GOD IT'S HORRIFIC SO THIS 
IS WHAT YOUR TEETH WOULD END UP 
LOOKING LIKE IF YOU DIDN'T GO TO 
THE DENTIST PULLED ONE OF MY OWN 
TEETH THERE LOST A FEW BACK HERE 
AS WELL NOT AN ATTRACTIVE SIGHT 
IS IT 
LET THAT BE LESSON VISIT THE 
DENTIST BRUSH YOUR TEETH AND DON'T 
DON'T GET INVOLVED IN DIY DENTISTRY 
OR YOU COULD END UP LOOKING LIKE 
THIS THIS JUSTIN BEFORE YOU GO OFF AND BRUSH 
THEM TELL ME WHY IT IS THAT YOU 
THINK NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE GETTING 
TO N. H. S. DENTISTS NOW WHAT IS THE 
PROBLEM WITH THE SYSTEM 
WHAT THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS IS THAT THERE'S A 
PERCEPTION PROBLEM THERE WAS A BIT 
OF A PROBLEM WITH UNDERFUNDING IN 
THE PAST MANY DENTISTS DECIDED TO 
FROE CAN YOU SAY ON PRIVATE WORK 
AND STOP DOING N. H. S. WORK THE 
GOVERNMENT SAID IT RECOGNISED THERE 
WAS A PROBLEM AND DID SOMETHING 
ABOUT IT BY CHANGING THE CONTRACT 
THAT'S RESULTED IN A BIT OF A 
DISPUTE BETWEEN DENTISTS AND THE 
GOVERNMENT THE DENTISTS SAY 
THEY'RE NOT BEING FUNDED IN A WAY 
THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO THE WORK 
THEY WANT TO DO THE GOVERNMENT 
SAYS THIS IS TEETHING BE PROBLEMS 
THEY'RE PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO 
DENTISTS AND THERE WILL BE MORE 
DENTISTS OUT THERE AND THEY ASSURED 
US THAT EVERYONE IN BRITAIN SHOULD 
BE ABLE TO SIGN UP WITH AN N. H. S. 
DENTIST 
HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT DENTIST MANAGE TO GET THESE THINGS WRONG 
IF YOU BELIEVE THEY HAVE 
MANAGED TO 
GET IT WRONG 
I THINK THE 
GOVERNMENT HAD GOOD INTENTIONS BUT 
THEY DIDN'T EXPLAIN TO THE PROBLEM 
HOW TO GET A DENTIST AND ALSO IF 
YOU'RE GOING TO GET A DENTIST 
THROUGH YOUR LOCAL HEALTH TRUST 
THAT COULD INVOLVE TRAVELLING QUITE 
A LONG WAY L. THINK ONE OF THE 
PROBLEMS ABOUT HAVING A PLAN FOR 
THE WHOLE OF THE COUNTRY AND 
ROLLING IT OUT IS THAT MOST 
POLITICIANS SIT IN WHITEHALL AND 
THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY OUT THERE IN 
BRITAIN BRITAIN I'VE GOT A HOUSE IN YORKSHIRE AND 
THERE'S A SMALL TOWN NEAR TO ME IN 
NORTH YORKSHIRE AND THE LOCAL 
DENTIST HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT 
HE'LL STOP DOING NATIONAL HEALTH 
WORK OF THE FOR THE PEOPLE THERE IT 
WILL MEAN A JOURNEY OF FIFTEEN MILES 
PROBABLY TO GO TO THE DENTIST ALL 
RIGHT THAT WOULD BE O. K. FOR ALL OF 
US WITH A CAR AND TIME ON OUR HANDS 
BUT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING 
THIS PROGRAMME THE VERY YOUNG AND 
VERY OLD THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT AND 
TAKE UP A LOT OF THEIR TIME WE'LL WE'LL HAVE SOME ADVICE ON HOW TO GET AN 
N. H. S. DENTIST A BIT LATER DON'T DO 
IT YOURSELF 
JUST WATCHING THAT 
BRINGS TEARS TO YOUR EYES DAN 
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU'VE BEEN 
I'M JUST A PUNCH BAG TODAY WHEN WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE A DENTIST SEVEN SEVEN YEARS AGO 
THAT'S SHOCKING YOU'RE 
LIKE ALL BLOKES YOU THINK IT WILL 
BE ALL RIGHT IN THE END 
MY TEETH 
DIDN'T HURT 
YOU WENT TO OXFORD 
UNIVERSITY FOR GOD SAKE THEY'LL THEY'LL NOT HURT UNTIL THEY FALL OUT 
YOU'LL BE GLAD TO KNOW WE FORCED 
THE BIG BABOON TO SEE A DENTIST 
TREMBLING WITH FEAR A THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION THERE WAS A BIT OF 
I WONDER YOU DIDN'T HAVE THEM ALL 
EXTRACTED FOR ROTTENESS THIS IS 
THE VERDICT 
THIS IS WHAT THE DENTIST MADE OF 
YOUR TEETH 
PROBABLY HAD TOO MANY SOFT DRINKS 
IN HIS TIME HE HAS SOME ACID 
EROSION AT THE EDGES OF THESE TEETH 
HE'S BEGINNING TO HAVE GUM PROBLEMS 
HE HAS SOME PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF 
APPEARANCE IN TERMS OF STAINING 
BY THE TIME HE WAS AWARE OF IT AND 
IF HE DIDN'T GET THE RIGHT ADVICE 
IT WOULD BE TOO LATE FOR HIM TO DO 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
ACID EROSION 
GUM PROBLEMS AND STAINING 
IT'S DRINKING FIZZY DRINKS THEY'RE 
DISGUSTING 
YOU'RE GOING TO GO FROM DISGUSTING NOW ON REGULAR CHECK UPS 
ARE YOU BRUSHING MORNING AND 
EVENING 
YES AND I USE MOUTH WASH EVENING AS WELL 
TO IMPROVE YOUR BREATH FOR 
THE LADIES GET A PROPER CHECK UP 
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU L. HAVE TOMORROW 
PLIERS FIVE MILLION OF US IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES LIVE IN FLOOD 
RISK AREAS LAST YEAR WE HAD THE 
WETTEST SUMMER IN TWO HUNDRED FORTY YEARS TOO 
MANY OF YOU FOUND YOURSELVES UP TO 
YOUR WAISTS IN WATER HERE IS OUR 
SCIENTIST SHINI SOMARATHNE ON 
WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR 
BACKGARDENS TO HELP US KEEP ALL OUR 
LIVING ROOMS DRY THE NEXT TIME THE 
RAIN WON'T STOP FALLING AFTER THE 
EVENTS OF LAST YEAR WE'VE BEEN TOLD 
TO EXPECT A LOT MORE FLOODING 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST RAIN THAT'S TO 
BLAME BLAME WE MIGHT BE ADDING TO THE PROBLEM 
OURSELVES OURSELVES OUR LOVE OF OFFSTREET PARKING 
PATIOS AND SHOPPING CENTRES HAS 
SEALED THE GROUND OVER AND 
EFFECTIVELY WATER PROOFED OUR 
CITIES THAT CREATES A BASIC 
ENGINEERING PROBLEM 
IN THE NATURAL LANDSCAPE WATER 
SOAKS INTO THE GROUND AND ENDS UP 
IN THE WATER TABLE 
BUT IF WE'VE PAVED IT OVER THERE'S 
ONLY ONE PLACE IT CAN GO 
IN HEAVY RAIN DRAINS JUST GET 
OVERWHELMED AND OUR CITIES FILL UP 
LIKE SWIMMING POOLS WHICH IS WHAT 
HAPPENED LAST SUMMER 
IT WAS REALLY QUITE SCARY YOU CAN 
SEE IT STARTING TO RUN DOWN THE 
WHOLE OF THE STREET AND THEN 
STARTING TO DEVELOP UNTIL PEOPLE'S 
GARDENS WATCHING THAT IT'S QUITE 
SCARY BECAUSE YOU SEE IT MOVING 
QUITE FAST THE DRAINS REALLY I 
THINK HAVE A LOT TO ANSWER TO 
THEY'RE UNABLE TO COPE 
ONE VIEWER LOUISE WAS FLOODED IN 
HULL LAST YEAR AND HAS AGREED TO 
TAKE PART IN AN EXPERIMENT TO TEST 
OUT A NEW APPROACH TO FLOOD 
PREVENTION PREVENTION THIS MAY LOOK LIKE YOUR BOG 
STANDARD PAVING BUT IT'S ACTUALLY 
THE LATEST IN DRAINAGE TECHNOLOGY 
NO MORTAR OR CEMENT INSTEAD FROM 
THE JAGGED EDGES OF THE BLOCKS ON 
TOP TO THE ROCKS UNDERNEATH 
EVERYTHING HAS GAPS TO ALLOW THE 
WATER TO FLOW THROUGH TO THE EARTH 
BELOW IT'S SOMETHING WE'LL ALL 
HAVE TO GET FAMILIAR WITH 
ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS 
AS OF AUTUMN THIS YEAR IF YOU WANT 
TO LAY A PATIO OR ANY SORT OF 
PAVING YOU'LL HAVE TO EITHER APPLY 
FOR PLANNING PERMISSION WHICH YOU 
WON'T BE GUARANTEED TO GET OR LAY 
SOME OF THOSE BUT WILL POURUS 
PAVING REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
LOUISE AND I WILL PUT THEM TO THE 
TEST WE HAVE A LOT OF WATER AND 
TWO DRIVE WAYS ONE STANDARD AND 
ONE PERMEABLE WE'VE 
CALCULATED THE VOLUME OF WATER THAT 
FELL ON HULL IN LAST YEAR'S FLOODS 
IN AN AREA THIS SIZE THAT'S TWO HUNDRED FORTY 
LITRES 
THE NORMAL PAVING LOOKS HORRIBLY 
FAMILIAR BUT THE POURUS PAVING IS 
SOAKING IT UP 
MY PERMEABLE ONE IS COMPLETELY DRY 
BUT YOURS THAT'S TERRIBLE ISN'T 
IT 
AND MOST PEOPLE HAVE SURFACES IT LIKE THIS IF THIS WAS THE AMOUNT 
OF WATER WHICH FELL IN HULL FOR 
EVERYONE TO HAVE THAT AND FOR IT TO 
GO DOWN THE DRAINS YOU COULD SEE 
HOW IT WOULD 
YEAH DOES THIS 
MAKE YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE 
KIND OF PAVING YOU WANT TO USE IN 
THE FUTURE OR YOUR NEIGHBOURS MIGHT 
USE 
YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE DAFT USE NOT TO CONSIDER SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH THIS IS FANTASTIC 
IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE BUT IS 
POURUS PAVING A SOLUTION TO SURFACE 
WATER FLOODING WELL ON ITS OWN 
NO BUT ANYTHING THAT ALLOWS WATER 
TO RUN INTO THE GROUND HAS TO HELP 
IF YOU DO NEED TO USE PAVING 
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THAT THIS 
STUFF IS DEFINITELY MORE FLOOD 
FRIENDLY FRIENDLY OUR SCIENTIST SHINI IS WITH US IN 
OUR CONCRETE ONE SHOWGARDEN SHAME 
ON US 
THIS IS THE PROBLEM 
I KNOW IT'S 
NOT A BACKGARDEN BUT IT'S AN 
EXPANSE OF CONCRETE 
IT'S AN 
EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO 
AVOID 
I'M COMING DOWN HERE WITH A AVOID LUMP HAMMER LATER TO BREAK IT UP 
SO THE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING ACTION 
ON THIS ISN'T IT THEY'RE THEY'RE PROPOSING THAT AS OF AUTUMN THIS 
YEAR IF YOU WANT TO LAY ANY KIND 
OF PAVING IN YOUR FRONT GARDEN YOU 
HAVE TO USE POURUS PAVING OR APPLY 
FOR PLANNING PERMISSION 
IF YOU IF 
YOU WANT TO PUT CONCRETE DOWN YOU 
HAVE TO APPLY FOR PLANNING 
PERMISSION BUT IF YOU WANT TO USE 
THIS STUFF WHICH DOES WORK DO 
YOU HAVE TO REPLACE NO ONE IS 
GOING TO MAKE YOU REPLACE YOUR 
CONCRETE PAVING 
IF YOU HAVE 
STANDARD PAVING ALREADY YOU'RE FINE 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO LAY DOWN NEW 
PAVING YOU HAVE TO USE POURUS ONES 
IS THIS STUFF MORE EXPENSIVE THAN 
ORDINARY PAVING 
YEAH THAT'S THE 
SNAG IT'S ABOUT ONE AND A HALF 
TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE BUT WHEN YOU 
WEIGH UP UP THE COSTS IT'S ABOUT 
THE SAME IT COSTS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE TO 
APPLY FOR PLANNING PERMISSION BUT 
THERE ARE CHEAPER ALTERNATIVES WE 
HAVE SOME HEREWHAT'S THAT TURF THAT TURF GOOD OLD TURF THE CHEAPEST FORM OF 
POURUS PAVING IT ALLOWS THE WATER 
TO OAK THROUGH WHICH IS THE BASIC 
PRINCIPLE OF THIS THAT'S THE 
CHEAPEST BUT NOT SO GOOD FOR DRIVE 
WAYS WHEN YOU HAVE VEHICLES PASSING 
OVER IT YOU CAN USE GRAVEL WHICH 
IS ALSO CHEAPER THAN POURUS PAVING 
OF COURSE IT ALLOWS VEHICLES TO 
PASS OVER IT 
I KNOW YOU HAVE AN ENGINEERING 
BACKGROUND SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT 
ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS TO THE 
PROBLEM BUT THIS WON'T SOLVE IT 
EVEN IF EVERYBODY STARTED USING 
POURUS PAVING TOMORROW IT WOULDN'T 
SOLVE THE PROBLEM 
WITH URBAN 
DEVELOPMENTS WE HAVE LOADS OF 
STANDARD PAVING OUT THERE ALREADY 
IT WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT IT 
WILL HELP THERE ARE OTHER THINGS 
YOU CAN DO YOU CAN USE WATER BUTTS 
TO COLLECT RAIN WATER FROM YOUR 
ROOF AND THE WATER LATER TO CLEAN 
YOUR GARDEN OR WHATEVER OR DO 
SOMETHING WHACKY LIKE PUT TURF ON 
YOUR ROOF AND ALSO INSULATE THE 
ROOF 
YOU DON'T TAKE YOUR LAWN ROOF MOWER ON THE ROOF 
THAT'S A GOOD 
QUESTION 
THAT'S SOMETHING FOR YOU QUESTION TO WORK ON 
CHEERS 
ONE THING YOU ARE UNLIKELY TO SEE 
IN CONCRETE GARDENS ARE THESE 
DORMICE DO THEY GET ANY CUTER 
I'M SPEAKING QUIETLY IN CASE THEY 
WAKEN UP THE DORMICE ARE BRED TO 
RETURN TO THE WILD AN EXEXPANSION 
OF URBAN AREAS IS ONE OF THE 
REASONS THEY HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO 
EXTINCT THANKS TO DETERMINED 
VOLUNTEERS LIKE THE GROUP STEVE 
HAS BEEN VISITING IN THE WEST 
COUNTRY THE HUMBLE DORMICE IS 
COMING BACK FROM THE BRINK OF 
EXTINCTION RATHER EMPRESSIVE 
CREATURES WILL CAPTURE THE PUBLIC'S 
IMAGINATION HERE AT THE ZOOR THEY 
BELIEVE SMALLER CREATURES ARE MORE 
PARENT WHICH IS WHY THEY'VE BECOME 
PART OF A PLAN TO BRING THE DORMICE 
BACK FROM THE BRINK WHEN LEWIS CAR 
ROLL WROTE ALICE IN WONDERLAND 
DORMICE WERE FAMILIAR CREATURES IN 
THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY YEARS SINCE THEY VANISHED 
FROM SEVEN COUNTIES AND ARE 
GRADUALLY GOING FROM ELSEWHERE 
JULIAN CHAPMAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THE DORMICE WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT THE 
ZOO ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL 
THE MAIN 
THING THAT PAIGNTON ZOO DOES IS 
ANIMALS DUETOR RELEASE COME HERE 
THEY WILL BE MICRO CHIPPED AND 
HEALTH CHECKS TO MAKE SURE THE 
ANIMALS ARE THE HEALTHIEST ONES WE 
CAN RELEASE 
WHAT HEALTH CHECKS 
PARASITES TAKE SAMPLES AND WORM AS 
NECESSARY WE WILL DO CHECKS THIS 
GUY IS QUITE TOO BIG TOO LIGHT 
THEY WON'T SURVIVE MAKE SURE THEY 
HAVE THEIR LIMBS AND TAIL SO THEY 
CAN BALANCE PROPERLY CHECKING CHECKING THEIR I. D. AND IN GOOD PHYSICAL 
HEALTH A NETWORK OF VOLUNTEER 
BREEDERS SUPPLIES THE ZOO WITH 
DORMICE FOR RELEASE MICHAEL WOODS 
HAS BEEN A BREEDER FOR YEARS AND HE 
MONITORS THE REMAINING WILD 
POPULATION I'M GOING TO MEET HIM 
AT A CONVER CONSERVATION SITE HOW 
HE KEEPS TABS ON TINY ANIMALS WE WE HAVE THE BIGGEST MONITORING 
PROGRAMME PRETTY MUCH FOR ANY 
MAMMAL SPECIES OVER A LONGEST 
LENGTH OF TIME IN BRITAIN BY MEANS 
WE HAVE A HANDLE ON WHAT DORMICE 
ARE DOING AND THE FACT THEY ARE 
STILL IN DECLINE 
WHAT ABOUT 
CLIMATE CHANGE HOW IS THAT 
AFFECTING THE DORMICE 
THAT IS 
REALLY BAD FOR THEM MAINLY BECAUSE 
THEY ARE BIG HIBERNATETORS AND 
WARM WINTORS MEANS THEY KEEP RISING 
FROM HIGH BETTER NATION IF THERE'S 
NO FOOD FOR THEM AND THEY RUN OUT 
OF FAT IT MEANS DEAD DORMICE WHAT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM 
DORMICE SPEND ALL 
THEIR SUMMER TIMES IN THE TOPS OF 
TREES AND WITH A REDUCTION IN 
WOODLAND MANAGEMENT AND 
FRAGMENTATION OF WOODLAND BECAUSE 
OF NEW RAILWAYS AND ROADS THEIR 
HABITAT HAS DISAPPEARED 
HUGELY AND SMALLER AND SMALLER 
POPULATIONS OF DORMICE MEAN EACH 
ONE BECOMES MORE VULNERABLE TO 
CHANCE EVENTS AND MUCH MORE EASY 
TO WIPE OUT 
MINI CAL PUTS UP NEST BOXES IN 
GRID EVERY TWENTY METRES TO PROVIDE 
WILE DORMICE WITH SHELTER IT LET'S 
HIM CHECK THEIR HEALTH AND FIND OUT 
WHICH PARTS OF THE WOODLAND THEY 
PREFER OH MY GOODNESS LOOK AT 
THAT 
THEY'RE ALL IN TAUPER THAT ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AREN'T THEY 
BEAUTIFUL TAUPER IS LIKE A MINI 
HIEB BETTER NATION TO SAVE ENERGY 
WHEN THERE'S NOT MUCH FOOD AROUND 
WE'RE HANDLING THEM AT A TIME THEY 
NORMALLY WAKE UP W. H. ARE THE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE AND VOLS 
AND WOOD MICE FIELD MICE THESE THESE WILL LAST FOR SIX OR SEVEN YEARS IN 
THE WILD WHICH IS A LONG TIME FOR 
A SMALL RODENT THEY HIEB BETTERATE 
OTHERS DON'T THEY LIVE IN THE TOPS 
OF THE TREES THEY HARDLY GET EATEN 
BY ANYTHING AND LIVE IN LOW 
DENSITIES SEVEN AND EIGHT TO THE 
HECTARE WOOD 
YOU CAN GET UP 
TO TWO HUNDRED HECTARE HUGE DIFFERENCENESS 
THE WAY THEY LIVE WOOD MICE AND 
BANK MEANS THEY CAN BREED IT UP 
QUICKLY DORMICE DON'T DO THAT 
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE PROTECTED AND 
WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE A LICENSE TO 
HANDLE THEM WE HAVE FORTY THOUSAND THE 
POPULATION OF JOEVILLE SO THERE'S 
NOT MANY OUT THERE 
WHEN CAPTURED DORMICE ARE 
INTRODUCED TO THE WILD THEY DO WELL 
BUT UNDERSTANDING THEM IS CRUCIAL 
FOR IDENTIFYING NEW SITES TO 
RELEASE THEM THAT'S WHY ON GOING 
WORK IS VITAL ON YESTERDAY'S SHOW 
WE TALKED ABOUT WHETHER MARRIAGE IS 
OUTDATED WE HAD TWO PILES ONE 
PILE WAS FOR MARRIAGE FOR CHRISTIE 
WE GOT ONE APPEAL HERE 
THIS WAS 
FROM OFVILLE I'D LOVE TO BE 
MARRIED I'M FORTY SIX AND HAVE BEEN 
SINGLE ALL MY LIFE MOST MEN 
IRRITATE ME AFTER A WHILE FUNNY 
OFVILLE I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING 
ABOUT ABOUT ARE YOU IN FAVOUR OF THE 
INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE 
I'VE BEEN 
MARRIED FOUR TIMES BUT I THINK NOW 
PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THERE'S NO POINT 
IN ENDLESSLY GETTING MARRIED I'M 
NOT GETTING MARRIED A FIFTH TIME 
IT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING ILT YOU 
CAN'T SAY THEY'RE A LEARNING CURVE 
BUT I DO THINK THERE'S A SERIOUS 
POINT TODAY THAT WE GO ON AND ON GO 
YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR 
AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND I THINK A 
LOT OF PEOPLE HAVEN'T SET THEM ANY 
EXAMPLE BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T GROW 
NEWSPAPER A HOUSE WHERE PEOPLE 
THERE ARE PARENTS AND THEY HAVE 
SOME CODES OF BEHAVIOUR YOU DON'T 
SET ANY EXAMPLE FOR YOUR CHILDREN 
AND RATHER THAN BLAMING CHILDREN 
AND DEMONISING YOUNG CHILDREN WE 
SHOULD LOOK AT OUR OWN MAY HAVE 
YOUR I HAVEN'T GOT KIDS SO 
HAVE YOU A VIEW LOOK FORWARD TO 
T. BUT I HAVEN'T MET THE RIGHT 
PERSON YET 
MR. RIGHT THERE'S MR. TEN PER CENT 
HAVE YOU 
A VIEW ON THE TERMINAL FIVE CHAOS 
DON'T BLAME THE ARCHITECT FOR 
TERMINAL FIVE BLAME THE PEOPLE 
RUNNING IT B. A. A. AND BRITISH AIRWAYS 
WE'VE GOT A VIEW ONE VIEWER JIM

I LEFT MY NEW JALOPY AT THE 
AIRPORT PARKING LOT

EARLY MORNING SLOT 
A GALAXY OF SMILING FACES 
HASTENED TO EXPLAIN 
LEAVE YOUR BAGGAGE SAFE WITH US 
WE'RE THE NATIONAL BAGGAGE TRAIN 
NOW NEVER TAKE AS GOSPEL TRUTH 
THE THINGS YOU HEAR ABOUT 
THIS THOUGHT ROTATED IN MY HEAD 
AND BANNISHED ANY DOUBT 
BUT WHEN WE ARRIVED AT TERMINAL FIVE 
IT REALLY CAUSED ME PAIN 
COS THEY'D LOST MY CASE WITHOUT A 
TRACE TRACE NEVER SEEN AGAIN 
WE'RE HERE TO HELP WE WANT YOU 
TO REMAIN 
LOYAL TO THE NATIONAL BAGGAGE 
TRAIN TRAIN NOW MY FAVOURITE HAT'S IN PANAMA 
MY CAMERA'S IN MILAN
