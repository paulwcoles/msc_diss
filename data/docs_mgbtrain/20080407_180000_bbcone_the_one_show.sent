NATIONAL SUPPORTING MCKELVEY WE 
WERE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO A GREAT 
DAY FROM MCKELVEY AND HIS TEAM MAY 
BE A FAIRY TALE ENDING IT DID NOT 
WORK OUT LIKE THAT HE

SUSTAINING 
INJURIES WHICH MEANT

HORRIFIED AS MEMBERS OF THE 
MCKELVEY TEAM CLARE BALDING IS 
HERE AS WELL AS OUR A THE ONE SHOW 
VET JOE INGLE'S YOU ARE BOTH 
THERE AND WORKING AWAY IT WAS 
INITIAL SHOCK TO BEGIN WAVES I I THINK THAT IS THE SAME FOR A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WATCHING SUE DID NOT 
REALISE OBVIOUSLY YOU FEEL A LOT 
OF PAIN NO ONE IS FEELING THAT 
MORE THAN PETER AND KAREN BEHREND 
AND THE WHOLE TEAM IN PEMBROKESHIRE 
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY DISTRAUGHT 
THAT HORSE WAS THE BEACON FOR BACK 
YARD HE NEARLY WON THE GRAND 
NATIONAL LAST YEAR HE WAS ON THE 
VERGE OF BEING A NATIONAL HERO NOW 
HE IS NOT THERE ANYMORE AND THAT 
BOX IS EMPTY 
WE HAVE HAD FIVE HUNDRED E. 
MAILS WHICH IS A LOT ON A SINGLE 
SUBJECT TWO THIRDS ARE EXTREMELY 
SYMPATHETIC A THIRD OF THEM ARE 
RATHER ANGRY ABOUT IT THE GENERAL 
DRIFT IS A YACHT ALL UPSET BUT 
WHAT TO EXPECT YOU ENTER A HORSE 
INTO ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST 
DANGEROUS STEEPLECHASES HOW DO YOU 
RESPOND 
NOBODY I THAT TRAINS OR RESPOND OWNS A HORSE THINKING THIS HORSE IS 
GOING TO DIE ONE DAY BY THERE 
YOU KNOW IT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ANYONE 
OF US AND ANY ANIMAL YOU HAVE EVER 
HAD FORCED IT YOU DO NOT GOING TO 
IT WITH THAT INTENTION HAD NO 
RACEHORSE IN THIS COUNTRY HAS 
CRUELTY INFLICTED UPON IT YOU KNOW 
FROM WATCHING MCKELVEY AND HOW WELL 
LOOKED AFTER HE WAS AND HOW WELL 
CARED FOR HE WAS HOW MUCH BETTER 
MARY ATTENTION HE HAD HAD HE WAS 
CLEARED BY ANOTHER INDEPENDENT VET 
BEFORE HE RANT IN THE RACE IT WAS 
EIGHT REALLY TRAGIC ACCIDENT RAN 
WE HAD THE HUGE RESPONSE FAMILIES 
AND YOUNG CHILDREN HAD BEEN 
WATCHING MCKELVEY'S PROGRESS WHY 
CAN YOU NOT JUST BECAUSE THE HORSE 
AND LET IT LIVE ITS LIFE NEVER TO 
RACE AGAIN 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT 
HORSES ARE SUCH FINE TUNED ATHLETES 
A HORSE IS QUITE A DELICATE 
CREATURE ABOUT HALF A TON OF HORSE 
IS RUNNING ON THE EQUIVALENT OF YOU 
OR I.'S FINGER INJURIES LIKE THIS 
CAN HAPPEN TO HORSES IN A PADDICK 
OR HORSES IN THE WILD WHERE THEY 
GET SPEAK TO ANY REAR UP AND THEY 
CAN FRACTURE THEIR BACK THERE IS 
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT COULD BE 
DONE THANKFULLY IT SOUNDS LIKE HE 
WAS NOT IN ANY GREAT PAIN HE WAS 
PUT TO SLEEP VERY QUICKLY THIS IS 
A COMMON ENDING FOR SOME HORSES 
BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF THE RACE 
EVERYTHING IS DONE TO TRIED TO 
MITIGATE THAT 
IN TERMS OF LEG 
INJURIES PEOPLE CANNOT UNDERSTAND 
WHY IT CANNOT BE FIXED IN SOME 
CASES IT CAN BE ON THE RACECOURSE 
IT IS VERY STRESSFUL 
I HAVE BEEN 
TO THE GRAND NATIONAL L. HAD GROWN 
UP IN LIVERPOOL WITH IT BEING A 
TRADITIONAL BUT I HAVE WATCHED IT 
WITH FEAR L. REMEMBER BEING AT A 
RACE WHEN THEY PUT A HORSE DOWN IT 
WAS SO DISTRESSING IT IS 
HORRENDOUS I WOULD MISS THE GRAND 
NATIONAL 
IN TEARS PART OF THE NATIONAL JEOPARDY BEHIND IT WHICH MAKES IT 
SUCH A GREAT SPECTACLE IT IS 
PART LET'S REMIND OURSELVES OF THE 
HAPPIER TIMES HE LOOKED A GREAT 
MOVER TO ME IT WAS A PRIVILEGE TO 
FOLLOW THIS ATHLETE ON THE ONE 
SHOWN WE'RE VERY SORRY FOR 
EVERYONE CONCERNED THAT THE STORY 
DID NOT HAVE A HAPPIER ENDING 
THE ONE SHOW THE EXPRESSION 
CREDIT CRUNCH IS BEING BANDIED 
ABOUT A LOT AT THE MOMENT ALL IT 
REALLY MEANS IS THAT AN AWFUL LOT 
OF US OWE AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY 
THEN SHARKS GET INTO A BIT OF A 
FEEDING FRENZY IF YOU ARE 
STRUGGLING BANKS AND BUILDING 
SOCIETIES WILL NOT LEND TO YOU 
LOAN SHARKS CAN FEEL LIKE THE ANY 
OPTION NEED A LOAN BUT HAVE GOT A 
POOR CREDIT RATING WHAT DO YOU DO 
IF YOUR BANK TELLS YOU TO SLING 
YOUR HOOK L. L. KNOW A PLACE THAT WILL 
NOT TREAT YOU LIKE A FISH OUT OF 
WATER WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS TRACK 
DOWN YOUR LOCAL CREDIT UNION YOU 
WILL NOT FIND ONE HERE ALL IN HERE 
A CREDIT UNION IS A FINANCIAL CO 
OPERATIVE OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY 
ITS OWN MEMBERS THEY WILL LEND YOU 
MONEY AND YOU CAN SAVE WITH THEM AS 
WELL THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR 
YEARS SO THEY ARE NO FLY BY NIGHT 
WHAT IS MORE THEY ARE REGULATED BY 
THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY 
YOUR MONEY IS AS SAFE WITH THEM AS 
IT IS WITH ANY HIGH STREET BANK 
LAST YEAR CREDIT UNIONS LENT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
MILLION THROUGH FIVE HUNDRED OUTLETS THERE 
SHOULD BE ONE NEAR YOU L. HAPPEN TO 
KNOW THERE IS ONE IN HERE THIS IS 
HOME TO THE CARDIFF CREDIT UNION 
AND ITS MANAGER 
WE LIKE TO THINK 
WE ARE THE FAIR AND FRIENDLY FACE 
OF FINANCE WE ARE FLEXIBLE AND 
COUNT AND CAN LEND SMALL AMOUNTS 
AND LARGE AMOUNTS THE MINIMUM 
AMOUNT WOULD BE FROM FIFTY THAT IS 
THE SMALLEST LOAN WE HAVE EVER DONE 
YOU ARE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE LOAN 
SHARKS 
WE ARE SO MUCH CHEAPER IF SHARKS IF PEOPLE DID NOT KEEP UP WITH THEIR 
PAYMENTS WHICH YOU SENT ROUND THE 
HEAD LEASE 
NOTE WE WOULD NOT ONE ONE LOAN SHARK WAS RECENTLY PROSECUTED 
FOR CHARGING AN ANNUAL INTEREST 
RATE OF EIGHT THOUSAND PER CENT YES YOU DID HEAR 
ME CORRECTLY IF YOU USE A CREDIT 
UNION THEY CANNOT CHARGE MORE THAN 
TWO PER CENT MONTH THAT IS AN A. P. R. OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT 
PER CENT MEET JENNY HUGHES FROM 
CAERPHILLY WHEN HER WASHING 
MACHINE PACKED UP RECENTLY SHE 
NEEDED A SMALL RENTED BY ANYONE 
SHE TURNED TO HER LOCAL CREDIT 
UNIONS FOR HELP BLOWN THE THE WHENEVER I HAVE BORROWED FROM THEM 
IT HAS BEEN FOR SMALL AMOUNTS AS 
FAR AS I AM AWARE BANKS ARE ONLY 
INTERESTED IF YOU WANT TO BORROW A 
FEW THOUSAND AT THE MOMENT MY 
CREDIT REFERENCE IS POOR IN THE 
PAST ONCE OR TWICE IT HAS DROPPED 
WHEREAS THE CREDIT 
UNION WILL 
KEEP 
YOU THE 
BENEFIT OF 
THE DOUBT 
AS 
LONG AS 
YOU CAN 
PROVE YOU CAN MAKE 
THE PAYMENT FROM PERSONAL 
EXPERIENCE BANKS IF THEY RUN A 
CREDIT CHECK THAT IS IT IT TAKES 
A FEW YEARS TO RECOVER FROM A POOR 
CREDIT RATING 
HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO 
RESORT TO A LOAN SHARK 
NO NOT AT 
ALL THIS IS A WEEK DID ALTERNATIVE 
TO THE BANK WITHOUT GOING DOWN THAT 
C. D. ROAD 
IF YOU NEED SOME CASH AND 
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY LUCK FROM 
THE BANKS TRY GOING TO THE LOCAL 
CREDIT UNIONS SAY GOODBYE TO THE 
LOAN SHARK WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT 
CREDIT UNIONS THEY ARE A POOR 
MAN'S BANK AND DO NOT AMOUNT TO 
MATCH IT IS A SERIOUS MOVEMENT NOW 
TEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO IT WAS A POOR 
MAN'S BANK THEY HAVE LEAPT FORWARD 
INTO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY A LOT OF THE 
SMALLER ONES HAVE MERGED THEY ARE 
GIVING OUT CHEQUEBOOKS AND PAIN IN 
BOOKS SOME ARE EVENING GIVING 
MORTGAGES PAYING IN 
WHERE YOU 
IMPRESSED 
THE LADY DIESEL WENT IMPRESSED INTO HER LOCAL CREDIT UNIONS THE 
OFFICES ARE REALLY FRIENDLY SHE 
HAS A CUP OF TEA AND COFFEE WITHOUT 
HAVING TO BORROW MONEY OFF THEM I I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THEM UNTIL NOW 
THEY SOUND GREAT L. THINK MORE 
PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THEM THE 
WORST THING YOU CAN DO IN THE WORLD 
IS GO TO A LOAN SHARK 
EIGHT TWO ZERO ZERO ZERO PER CENT ONE 
GUY CHARGE 
FAT LADY WAS TALKING 
ABOUT SMALL AMOUNTS THAT LADY 
YOU HAVE NOT GOT TO PACE SETTING OF 
FEES AND THINGS LIKE THAT THEY 
WILL LEND IN HUNDREDS A SETTING 
UP FEES 
HOW DOES THE INTEREST RATE 
WORK 
THEY ARE REGULATED BY THE F. S. A. WORK THEY CANNOT CHARGE MORE THAN TWO PER CENT A 
MONTH IT IS A GOOD WAY TO BORROW 
FOR SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY 
NOW FOR 
YOUR TIPS 
TELL LENDERS YOU ARE IN 
TROUBLE IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM DO 
NOT BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND 
TELL THEM LOOKING AT SUE LIKE SHE 
IS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE GET YOUR 
DEBT AND PUT IT INTO PRIORITIES 
THESE ARE COMPANIES AND MASTERCARD 
WILL FACE NEW UP AND HAND YOU IF 
YOU ARE LATE HE WILL NOT GO TO 
JAIL FOR PAYING YOUR VISA YOU WILL 
D. FOR NOT PAYING YOUR COUNCIL TAX 
THERE IS FREE ADVICE YOU HAVE GOT 
CITIZENS ADVICE BUREAUX BANK 
MANAGES THEY WILL GIVE FREE ADVICE 
SOME PEOPLE ARE STICKING EXTRA 
LOANS ON TOP IT IS NOT A GOOD WAY 
TO DO IT 
ONE MAN WE ARE ALL IN 
DEBT TO HIS BOW A ROVING REPORTER 
PHIL TUFNELL HIS JOURNEY TO FIGHT 
THE STORIES BEHIND ODD PLACE NAMES 
TAKES INTO A VILLAGE WHICH COULD BE 
AN OLD WIVES TALE OLD WIVES LEES 
THAT IS A STRANGE NAME L. AM IN 
KENT IN THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND TO 
FIND OUT HOW THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE 
GOT HIS NAME YOU WERE BORN AND 
BRED HERE HAS THE NAME OF THIS 
PLACE GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH OLD 
WIVES 
OLD WIVES LEES IS IN THE WIVES PARISH OF CHILHAM ALL THE PARISH 
OF CHILHAM WAS OWNED BY THE CASTLE 
THE THEORY WAS THAT WHEN THE 
HUSBAND DIED AND THE HOUSES WERE 
GOING TO BE REPOSSESSED HE MEET 
THE WIDOWS UP HERE IT SOUNDS A 
GOOD IDEA TO ME 
YOU HAVE BEEN 
DIGGING AROUND IN THE ARCHIVE WHAT 
HAVE YOU BEEN COMING UP WITH I'VE I'VE FOUND A BAPTISM OF CHILEAN LEASE 
THIS PLACE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS 
CALLED LET ALONE WHY MAYBE 
CHILHAM CASTLE HOLDS THE KEY IN 
ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWELVE SAID DUDLEY TAKES BUILT THIS 
JACOBEAN MANOR ON THE SITE OF THE 
FORMER MEDIEVAL CASTLE IN ITS 
PRIME THE CHELA MISTAKE WOULD HAVE 
OWNED FAST VAST TRACTS OF LAND 
CHILHAM ESTATE IT DOES MAKE SENSE 
TO GET THE YOUNG ONES IN AS LORD 
OF THE MANOR TELL US WHAT THIRD 
DERBY WAS LIKE 
HE HAD THE POWER TO 
DO SO BUT I DO NOT THINK HE HAD THE 
INCLINATION IN LONDON HE WAS A 
COURTIER AND A POLITICIAN HE GOT 
HIMSELF INTO TROUBLE WHICH ENDED UP 
WITH HIM BEING IN THE TOWER OF 
LONDON LATER ON HE GOT HIMSELF A 
PARROT AND BECAME A SENIOR JUDGE 
HE ACTUALLY PAID FOR THAT POST 
WHAT IS YOUR THEORY ABOUT HOW THIS 
PLACE GOT ITS NAME 
I CAN IMAGINE 
JOKE HIS IN THE LOCAL PUBS MIGHT 
WELL HAVE MADE SOMETHING OF THIS 
OLD WOOD BECOMES COLD WINTERS AND 
THEN OLD WIDOWS AND THEN BOWLED 
WIDES IN THOSE DAYS THE TERM WIFE 
WAS USED AS A WOMAN OF MATURE YEARS 
FAT IS A COUP THEORY HAVE HEARD 
THERE IS ONE MORE TALE TO TELL 
THAT IS GOOD THEORY WHAT YOU 
THINK EXPLAINS THIS SITUATION 
THERE IS IN MAP OF ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY SIX SHOWING IT 
AS OLD WIVES LEES L. DO NOT THINK 
THAT DIRTY DEEDS AND OLD WIVES LEES 
STORY IS ACTUALLY TRUE THE DIRTY 
STORY DUDLEY THE EVOLUTION FROM 
COLD WINDS INTO OLD WIVES TAKE 
PLACE OVER THE NEXT FEW HUNDRED 
YEARS THESE USUALLY MEANS A MEADOW 
OR A PASTOR 
SO YOU THINK THAT 
OVER THE PASSAGE OF TIME AND 
LANGUAGE IT HAS CHANGED FROM COLD 
WINDS TO OLD WIVES LEES 
THAT IS 
LIKELY IT HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO 
WITH BEATING WIDOWS OF THE ESTATE 
THESE ARE THE FAMILY SO FOR US 
THEY ARE LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO 
GET OUT OF WE HAVE PROMOTED YOUTH 
TO JIM'S POSITION YOU NEED TO HAVE 
YOUR LEGS AKIMBO 
I FEEL MORE 
POWERFUL 
FANTASTIC L. L. FOUND POWERFUL SOMETHING DOWN THE BACK OF HERE IS IS IT MY SCRIPT 
ARE THESE ANYTHING TO 
DO WITH YOU OTHER BRANDS ARE 
AVAILABLE BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE 
ROYLE FAMILY YOU ARE GOING BACK ON 
STAGE NOW AREN'T YOU 
IS HIS IT 
IS MORE SCARY BECAUSE IT IS A LIVE 
AUDIENCE YOU CAN'T SAY CAN I 
START AGAIN YOU HAVE TO GO ALL THE 
WAY THROUGH 
WITH LIVE STUFF YOU'RE 
NOT ALLOWED TO MESS UP ALTHOUGH WE 
DO IT ALL THE TIME 
YOU DON'T WANT 
TO MESS UP 
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE 
SHE IS PROFESSIONAL 
YOU DON'T 
BECAUSE IT IS NOT YOUR DIALOGUE 
THERE IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S DIALOGUE 
THIS PLAY SMALL CHANGE IS 
BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN IT IS SET IN 
CARDIFF THE PLAY IS ABOUT A LOT 
OF IT IS TO DO WITH THE LANGUAGE 
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO GO WRONG YOU 
WANT TO GET IT RIGHT 
BEING AWAY 
FOR FIVE YEARS 
FOUR OR FIVE IT IT IS LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE THE NERVE 
SCRIPT BACK IN 
IT IS VERY SCARY L. 
GOT SCARED ON THE FIRST NIGHT AND 
THEN YOU SETTLE DOWN THE NIGHT 
THAT YOU OPEN YOU ALWAYS WISH YOU 
HAD BEEN SOMETHING ELSE 
DO YOU SEE 
THE SCRIPT AND THINK THIS IS GOING 
TO BE MASSIVE 
I SAW THEIR SOFA AND 
I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE GREAT IT 
WAS A STRANGE SCRIPT RICKY AND I 
WERE BOTH SENT THEM 
YOU HAD BEEN 
TOGETHER FOR A WHILE 
WE HAD BEEN 
MARRIED FOR YEARS L. REMEMBER RICKI 
SAYING THIS IS EITHER GOING TO BE 
A REAL HIT OR IT WILL BE PUT ON AT 
MIDNIGHT YOU COULDN'T READ IT 
REALLY THE PAUSES I THOUGHT IT 
WAS FUNNY BUT I HAD NO IDEA JUST 
HOW ENGAGING IT WAS GOING TO BE 
SUCH WONDERFUL DYNAMIC BETWEEN 
YOU AS ACTORS IT SEEMED TO CLICK 
WE CLICKED AS A FAMILY AND WE ALL 
ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH WE SPENT 
HOURS ON THERE EVEN WHEN THEY WERE 
CHANGING THE LIGHTS AROUND AND WE 
DIDN'T HAVE TODAY WE WOULD STAY ON 
THE SOFA 
WE ARE ALL SITTING AT 
HOME WATCHING YOU SIT ON THE SOFA 
IT'S AMAZING PEOPLE COULD WRITE 
SOMETHING IN WHICH SO LITTLE 
HAPPENED 
THAT IS WHAT WE USED TO HAPPENED SAY I REMEMBER AS FILMING WHERE WE 
ALL HAD A MINT AND THE CAMERA 
FOLLOWED US ALL AROUND SUCKING IT 
UNTIL ANTHONEY BUT HIS WE STARTED 
LAUGHING JUST AT THE LUNACY OF IT 
HOW LONG CAN YOU SUCK A POLO MINT 
FOR AND GET AWAY WITH IT 
WE SAW 
YOU IN BROOKSIDE IT TAKES ME BACK 
TO BEING A TEENAGER YOU OBVIOUSLY 
GET ON WELL WITH HIM WE GOT SOME 
SUGGESTIONS OF OTHER WORK YOU COULD 
DO TOGETHER WE HAVE GOT A COUPLE 
WE THINK IT MIGHT WORK A NEW JAMES 
BOND THAT HAS A LOOK OF REALITY 
ABOUT IT 
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE 
FINALLY YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME 
HOLIDAY RELIEF WORK AVAILABLE GET 
RID OF THAT SOFA YOU COULD JUST 
HAVE THAT ONE 
THAT AIRBRIDGE WAS 
GREAT 
THE ROYAL FAMILY FAMOUSLY GREAT DID NOT GET OUT MUCH PREFERRING TO 
LET LIFE PASS THEM BY FROM THIS A 
VERY SOBER SO FAIR 
AS WE KNOW FROM THE ONE SHOW SOFA 
THERE IS LOTS GOING ON OUTSIDE OUR 
WINDOW THAT IS EVEN WILDER THAN JIM 
ROYLE MIKE DILGER'S APRIL MY WIFE 
SPECTACLE SEES HIM IN PURSUIT OF 
ONE OF OUR BIGGEST BIRDS 
WILDLIFE WILDLIFE IF I SAID TO YOU THE WORD HERON 
WHAT WOULD YOU IMAGINE A SOLITARY 
FIGURE HUNCHED BY THE RIVERBANK OR 
ANOTHER BIRD ELEGANTLY WADING 
THROUGH THE SHALLOWS LOOKING FOR 
ITS DINNER OR EVEN A HERON 
STEALING YOUR PRIZE GOLDFISH FROM 
YOUR GARDEN POND 
WELL ALL OF THOSE THINGS CAN BE 
TRUE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE 
SOLITARY BIRDS GET DOWN RIGHT 
GREGARIOUS RIGHT NOW THEY ARE 
GOING TO BREED AND HAVE THEIR 
BABIES IT IS THE MOST SOCIAL TIME 
OF THEIR ENTIRE YEAR FOR OTHERS 
IT IS JUST A GREAT TIME TO WATCH 
THEM AS FEEDING CHICKS IS HARD 
WORK THE ADULTS MUST CATCH A THIRD 
OF THEIR BODY WEIGHT EVERY DAY TO 
KEEP THE YOUNG HAPPY WITH 
SPECIALLY ADAPTED SPRING LIKE NEXT 
AND SHARP BEAKS THEY ARE MORE THAN 
UP TO THE JOB THESE ARE LEAN MEAN 
FISHING MACHINES 
HERONS AND GATHER IN IT TO GROUPS 
OF THREE HUNDRED AT BREEDING TIME THIS 
NATURE RESERVE IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE 
HAS OF THE BIGGEST RESERVES IN THE 
COUNTRY TO KEEP IT THAT WAY A 
TEAM OF CONSERVATIONISTS AND 
VOLUNTEERS CHECK THE HEALTH OF THE 
CHICKS EACH SPRING BUT IT IS A 
RACE AGAINST THE CLOCK A TIGHT 
DEADLINE TODAY 
IT IS CRUCIAL WE 
GET IN AND OUT IN AN HOUR AND A 
HALF A MAXIMUM IF THE CHICKS ARE 
LEFT OPEN TO THE ELEMENT THEY 
WOULD SURVIVE 
LIKE THE S. A. S. IN AND 
OUT QUICKLY AS WE REACHED THE 
FIRST NEST THE CLOCK STARTS 
TICKING HUGE BIRDS MASSIVE WING 
SPANS IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE BACK IN 
THE JURASSIC YOU CAN HEAR THEM 
CALLING WONDERFUL TO HIT THE NINETY 
MINUTE DEADLINE THE TEAM OF TWENTY 
SPLIT INTO GROUPS EACH WITH A 
CLIMATE HE WILL TRY TO GET TO THE 
NEST AND THE TRICKS THEY ARE A 
PROTECTED SPECIES AND THE NEED A 
LICENCE TO GO UP AND CHECK IN THE 
NEST I HAVEN'T GOT ONE OF THOSE 
JOHN DOES BUT WE WILL GET A HERONS 
I. D. WITH A MINI CAMERA IF I ATTACH 
IT TO THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD LIKE 
THAT THAT WILL GIVE US A 
TREMENDOUS VIEW HERONS I VIEW 
HERONS OFTEN BUILD THEIR NESTS 
RIGHT AT THE END OF BRANCHES TO 
PROTECT THEIR BABIES EVEN GETTING 
CLOSE CAN BE DANGEROUS WORK IT 
WOULD BE SO GOOD IF WE COULD GET A 
LITTLE GLIMPSE WITH THAT CAMERA 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS GETTING PRETTY 
CLOSE HE HAS DONE REALLY WELL TO 
GET THAT HIGH 
YOU CAN SEE IT IS 
REALLY DANGEROUS A VERY PRECARIOUS 
THOSE BRANCHES COULD GIVE UNDER HIS 
WEIGHT IT IS THE WELFARE OF THE 
BIRDS BUT ALSO THE WELFARE OF THE 
CLIMATE 
ABSOLUTELY WHAT IS IT CLIMATE LIKE WHEN YOU STEP UP AND STICK 
YOUR HEAD OVER THE NEXT IS IT 
QUITE DANGEROUS 
THEY ARE QUITE BIG 
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THEY DON'T 
GO FOR YOUR EYES 
WHAT CAN YOU SAY 
A VERY LARGE CHICKS 
WE JUST SAW A 
GLIMPSE OF THE NEST THERE WE GO 
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE TWO THEY 
LOOK QUITE ADVANCED AND THEY ARE 
LOOKING LIVELY MEANWHILE ONE OF 
THE OTHER TEAMS HAS MANAGED TO 
REACH A NEST AND HAS BROUGHT THE 
CHICKS DOWN FOR A FULL HEALTH CHECK 
HOW OLD IS THAT 
ABOUT A WEEK AND AND THEY GORGEOUS IF TRICKY IS BIG 
ENOUGH A RINGING IS PLACED AROUND 
A LEG SO THE TEAM CAN CHART HOW FAR 
THEY TRAVEL AND HOW FAR THEY LIVE 
THREE YEARS AGO LOT OF SICK BIRDS 
WERE FOUND WHEN A NEARBY LAKE WAS 
POLLUTED IT IS A RELIEF TO SEE 
THEM LOOKING SO HEALTHY 
WHAT A TERRIFIC BOOST HE IS SO 
WARM I CAN FEEL HIS HEART BEATING 
HE IS LITTLE BIT TOO YOUNG TO 
HAVE A RING PLACED ON HIM BEAST 
WITH NINETY MINUTES UP WE RETREAT TO 
SAFE DISTANCE AND IN COME THE 
ADULTS TO FEED THEIR YOUNG IT HAS 
BEEN A REAL PRIVILEGE TO GET SO 
CLOSE TO THESE MAGNIFICENT BIRDS 
THANKS TO THE TEAM THESE HIGHLY 
SOCIABLE HERONS ARE THRIVING 
YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE HERONS LOOKING 
PREHISTORIC YOU WENT WRONG THEY 
HAVE A PREHISTORIC ANCESTORS THEY THEY CERTAINLY HAVE THE ARE KEY OPERA 
ASKS 
IT IS A REPTILE THAT EFFECTIVELY 
BECAME THE FIRST EVER FLYING BIRD 
FROM THERE 
YOU HAVE A HERON CAN CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN ARCHAEOPTERYX ARCHAEOPTERYX DO THOSE PREHISTORIC ONES GO AROUND 
STEALING PEOPLE'S FISH OUT OF POMS 
NOT THAT I AM AWARE OF THERE MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN UP TO DEVIOUS TRICKS BUT 
CERTAINLY THESE BEASTS WILL TAKE 
ENORMOUS FISH 
THIS IS JUST GREEDY 
ISN'T IT 
THEY WILL EAT ANYTHING 
THEY CAN GET DOWN THEIR NECK L. 
HAVE SEEN MANY THAME MOLE BELIEVE 
IT OR NOT FISH SMALL BIRDS THEY 
ARE GREEDY I HAVE SEEN THEM EAT 
A MOLE OFTEN THEY WILL GIVE THE 
GOLDFISH TO BE CHEQUE AND YOU'LL 
FIND A HALF EATEN GOLDFISH AT THE 
BOTTOM OF THE NEST CHICK WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT BIRDS IT IS A GREAT 
TIME FOR BIRDS THEY ARE STARTING 
TO SING THE BIRDS ARE ARRIVING 
BIRDS SINGING MEANS A LOT OF THINGS 
IT MEANS THEY ARE COURTING L. THINK 
WE HAVE SOME CLIPS OF SOME BIRDS 
COURTING 
UNNECESSARILY FUSSING COURTING THIS ONE WHY CAN'T THEY GET ON 
WITH IT 
I QUITE LIKE IT FLIRTING FLIRTING REAFFIRMING THEIR BOMBS WHAT 
THEY'RE DOING HERE IS THE WEED 
DANCE WHEN A RISE OF PRESS TO REST 
THEY OFFER EACH OTHER SOME WEEDS 
FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE PARK ON TOP 
OF THAT WE HAVE AN AMAZING BIRD 
THE BLACK GROUSE UNLIKE YOURSELF 
WHO LOOKS VERY ATTRACTIVE THE 
BLACK GROUSE THE MALES RATHER THAN 
THE ONES THE FEMALES ARE BORING 
AND BROWN 
DID THEY TRY AND MATE 
WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY DON'T 
FANCY THE FEMALES 
IT LOOKS LIKE 
MATING BUT IT IS A BIT OF A SCRAP 
THEY'RE WORKING OUT WHO IS THE TOP 
DOG THE MAIN BIRD IN THE GROUP 
WILL GET TO MATE WITH ALL OF THE 
FEMALES 
WHAT ARE THE OTHER MALE FEMALES BIRDS DOING WHEN ONE IS DOING MORE 
OF THE MATING FANTASISE 
THEY ARE 
LIKE AT THE EDGE OF THE DANCE FLOOR 
LOOKING AT THIS ONE 
THINKING I 
WISH IT WAS ME SEE DID YOU EVER 
KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT BIRDS 
I READ 
THAT WE ARE DOWN ON BIRDSONG THIS 
YEAR BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AS MANY 
BIRDS AS BE USED TO HAVE PROBLEMS PROBLEMS ON MIGRATION PROBLEMS IN AFRICA 
WHERE A LOT OF THE BIRDS SPEND THE 
WINTER A LOT OF THEM ARE IN 
DECLINE IT IS NOT JUST BIRDS 
INSECTS AS WELL 
WE HAVE GOT SOME 
MOTHS 
THIS IS CAROLINE BULMAN MOTHS SOME MOTHS THAT I HAVE BROUGHT IN 
WE GENERALLY SEE THEM AT THIS TIME 
OF YEAR IN THE SPRING 
I'VE GOT TO 
ADMIT I AM NOT A FAN L. THINK THEY 
ARE STUPID THEY CAN'T HELP BUT FLY 
INTO LIGHTS 
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT 
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL A LOT OF PEOPLE 
THINK THEY ARE BORING BROWN AND 
DULL THEY ARE FANTASTIC YOU CAN 
SEE FROM HERE SOME SPECIES THAT 
HAS SEEN THROUGHOUT THE SEASON 
THAT IS A BRIMSTONE WHICH STARTS 
COMING OUT IN THE SPRING IT IS A 
COMMON VISITOR TO GARDENS WHAT
