HELLO THE IS BREAKFAST WITH BLIL 
TURNBULL AND SUSANNA REID 
ON A COLLISION COURSE OVER 
CANNABIS CANNABIS THE GOVERNMENT IS SET TO DEFY ITS 
OWN EXPERTS AND RECLASSIFY THE DRUG 
AS MORE DANGEROUS 
GOOD MORNING IT IS WEDNESDAY SEVENTH 
MAY ALSO AHEAD AN APPEAL TO BURMA 
TO OPEN ITS BORDERS AS AID WORKERS 
STRUGGLES TO REACH SURVIVORS OF THE 
DEVASTATING CYCLONE THAT HAS LEFT 
MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND DEAD 
MORE COUNCILS ARE OFFERED LIE DEAT 
THE TIMEORS TO CALF OUT FRAUDSTERS 
CRITICS SAY THE TECHNOLOGY ISN'T 
RELYAL RELYAL AND WE TAKE A LOOK AT CONSUMER 
CONFIDENCE IT HAS HIT AN ALL TIME 
LOW WITH PEOPLE TIGHTENING THEIR 
BELTS THE 
IN WEATHER IF IT IS DULL WHERE YOU 
ARE AT THE MOMENT THE CHANCES ARE 
HIGH YOU WILL SEE SUNSHINE LATER ON 
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR THE BULK 
OF THE COUNTRY 
HANGING ON TO YOUR GREEN VALUABLES 
WHY ONE IN SEVEN GARDENS ARE BEING 
TARGETED BY THIEVES 
FIRST OUR MAIN STORY THERE IS A 
ROW LOOMING OVER THE CLASSIFICATION 
OF CANNABIS IT IS EXPECTED THE 
HOME SECRETARY WILL ANNOUNCE TODAY 
THAT THE DRUG WILL BE UPGRADED FROM 
CLASS C. WHERE POSSESSION IS 
TREATED LARGELY AS A NON ARRESTABLE 
OFFENCE TO CLASS B. GORDON BROWN 
HAS INDEPENDENTICATED HE WANTS TO 
SEND A STRONG MESSAGE TO THE YOUTH 
THAT CANNABIS USE IS UNACCEPTABLE 
BUT THE REPORT COMES ON THE VERY 
DAY THAT A REPORT SAYS IT SHOULD 
NOT CHANGE 
THE LAWS ON CANNABIS ARE UNDER THE 
MICROSCOPE AT THE FORENSIC SCIENCE 
SERVICE LABORATORY IN 
CAMBRIDGESHIRE THEY FIND THAT CAN 
INTELIS MORE POWERFUL THAN BEFORE 
AND THE STRONGER STRENGTH TYPE 
SKUNK IS MORE WIDESPREAD HOME 
OFFICE RESEARCH SUGGESTS IT 
ACCOUNTS FOR EIGHTY PER CENT OF SAMPLES SEIZED 
CANNABIS CULTIVATORS HAVE DEVELOPED 
HIGHER STRENGTH STRAINS OF CANNABIS 
THAT'S TYPICALLY GROWN INDOORS 
UNDER ARTIFICIAL CONDITIONS AND IT 
IS THESE HIGHER STRENGTH STRAINS 
THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
INCREASE IN THE DRUG STRENGTH 
STRONGER CANNABIS AND THE RISK OF 
DEVELOPING MENTAL ILLNESS LED SOME 
OF THE GOVERNMENT'S DRUGS ADVISORS 
TO CALL FOR CANNABIS TO BE RESTORED 
TO CLASS B. BUT MOST SAID IT SHOULD 
REMAIN A CLASS C. DRUG WHERE THE 
MAXIMUM PENALTY FOR POSSESSION IS 
TWO THIRDS RATHER THAN FIVE 
THE DRAFT REPORT SAYS 
BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS LIKELY TO 
DISREGARD THE PANEL'S ADVICE 
IF THEY GO AGAINST THE ADVICE OF 
THEIR ADVISORY BODY THAT WOULD BE 
A MISTAKE IT COULD SEND OUT SIGNAL 
THAT RATHER THAN BASE DRUGS POLICY 
ON EVIDENCE THEN IN FACT IT CAN BE 
DRIVEN BY POLITICAL HEADLINES AND 
SOME EXAGGERATED MEDIA COVERAGE 
MANY CANNABIS USERS HAVE BEEN 
SMOKING THE DRUG WITHOUT ILL 
AFFECTS FOR YEARS BUT THE COUNCIL 
SAYS YOUNG PEOPLE MUST BE MADE 
AWARE OF THE DANGERS 
INTERNATIONAL AID AGENCIES ARE 
WAITING FOR BURMA'S MILITARY RULERS 
TO OPEN THEIR BORDERS THE CYCLONE 
HAS KILL MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
FORTY THOUSAND ARE MISSING WINDS OF ONE HUNDRED 
MILES AN HOUR LEFT ONE MILLION 
WITHOUT FOOD AND WATER 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN 
BURMA ARE NOW ENDURING THEIR FIFTH 
DAY CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
STRANDED ACROSS THE IRRAWADDY 
DEALTIA WAITING FOR RELIEF TELL 
AT THAT INTERNATIONAL AID HAS BEEN 
TRICKLING INTO THE COUNTRY BUT 
NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE KNOWN TO BE 
DEAD MANY MORE ARE MISSING AND 
PERHAPS ONE MILLION ARE WITHOUT FOOD 
AND SHELTER AND THE TRUE SCALE OF 
THIS DISASTER IS YET TO EMERGE 
MANY ROADS ARE STILL BLOCKED BY 
FALLEN TREES AND DEBRIS THE 
GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE 
RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THIS 
CATASTROPHICY BUT IT IS STILL 
RELUCTANT TO OPEN THE DOOR FULLY TO 
THE INTERNATIONAL AID TEAMS WAITING 
OUTSIDE ENTIRE VILLAGES AND TOWNS 
WERE WIPED OUT BY THE TIDAL SURGE 
CAUSEDS BY SATURDAY'S CYCLONE THE 
FEAR IS THAT THE LONGER THE AID 
GROUPS ARE DELAYED THE WORST THE 
RISK OF DISEASE TAKING HOLD IN A 
COUNTRY WITH AN ALREADY FRAGILE 
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
IT'S AS YOU WERE IN THE RACE FOR 
THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION IN THE 
UNITED STATES BARACK OBAMA WON IN 
NORTH CAROLINA IT LOOKS LIKE 
HILLARY CLINTON HAS SCRAPED HOME IN 
INDIANA SO ARE WE ANY CLOSER TO 
FINDING OUT WHO WILL BE THE 
DEMOCRATS' PRESIDENTAL NOMINEE 
JONATHAN BEALE IS IN WASHINGTON FOR 
US IS THIS RACE BECOMING CLEARER 
OR MUDDIER 
WELL I THINK IT IS 
BECOMING CLEARER WE DON'T HAVE A 
DEFINITIVE ANSWER YET IN PART 
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE FINAL 
RESULT FROM INDIANA WHICH IS STILL 
TOO CLOSE TO CALL BUT REMEMBER THE 
LAST TWO MONTHS BARACK OBAMA HASN'T 
WON A BIG STATE HE HAS BEEN ON THE 
DEFENSIVE AND UNDER FIRE TONIGHT 
THAT MOOD DRAMATICALLY CHANGED WITH 
THAT BIG WIN IN NORTH CAROLINEIA 
HE MADE CLEAR IN HIS VICTORY SPEECH 
THAT HE BELIEVES THE PRIZE IS NOW 
HIS STPOO TONIGHT WE STAND LESS 
THAN TWO HUNDRED DELEGATES AWAY FROM 
SECURING THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION 
FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
WELL SIX MORE STATES TO GO 
JONATHAN WHAT ABOUT HILLARY'S 
CONFIDENCE ABOUT WINNING WELL WELL THERE WASN'T MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HER 
CAMPAIGN TONIGHT AND INDEED IF YOU 
LOOKED AT THE FACE OF HER HUSBAND 
BILL CLINTON THAT CERTAINLY DIDN'T 
EXUDE CONFIDENCE MUCH AT TIMES IT 
ALMOST SOUNDED LIKE SHE WAS 
PREPARING THE GROUND TO CONCEDE 
DEFEAT SAYING SHE WOULD WORK WITH 
WHOEVER WON THE PARTY'S NOMNAIG 
THAT SAID SHE DID DECLARE THE 
PARTY'S NUMBER NATION THAT SAID 
SHE DID DECLARE SHE WON THE STATE 
OF INDIANA AND SHE ALSO MADE CLEAR 
SHE WAS GOING TO STAY IN THE RACE 
TONIGHT WE HAVE COME FROM BEHIND 
WE HAVE BROKEN THE TIDE AND THANKS 
TO YOU IT'S FULL SPEED ON TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE 
AS YOU SAY SIX STATES REMAINING 
BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW 
HILLARY CLINTON CAN OVERCOME THAT 
LEAD OF BARACK OBAMA LATER TODAY 
WILL BE CRUCIAL SHE WILL MEET SOME 
SUPERDELEGATES THE PARTY GRANDEES 
WHO COULD ULTIMATELY DECIDE THE 
OUTCOME OF THE CONTEST BUT IT IS 
VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW HILLARY 
CLINTON CAN NOW TURN THIS AROUND 
THANK YOU HERE AN ARMED MAN DIED 
LAST NIGHT AFTER EXCHANGING FIRE 
WITH POLICE IN WEST LONDON AN 
INVESTIGATION IS TO BE CARRIED INTO 
THE SHOOTING IN CHELSEA WHICH BEGAN 
DURING RUSH HOUR AND ENDED ABOUT 
NINE ZERO ZERO P. M. THE GUNMAN FIRED ON ARMED 
OFFICERS ON THREE OCCASIONS BEFORE 
HE WAS SHOT AND KILLED 
THERE IS DANGER THAT LAST YEAR'S 
FLOODS WHICH DEVASTATED PARTS OF 
BRITAIN COULD BE REPEATED M. P.'S 
WARNED THERE ISN'T ENOUGH 
GOVERNMENT MONEY AVAILABLE AND SAYS 
NO ONE IS SURE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR UNBLOCKING DRAINS MORE THAN 
FIFTY THOUSAND HOMES AND BUSINESSS WERE 
AFFECTED BY LAST YEAR'S FLOODS 
A FEW MONTHS AGO WE TOLD YOU LIE 
DETECTORS ARE BEING TRIED OUT TO 
TRAP BENEFIT CHEATS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY AFTER SUCCESSFUL TRIALS 
THE EQUIPMENT IS TO BE ROLLED OUT 
TO EVEN MORE COUNCILS BUT THERE ARE 
QUESTIONS OVER HOW RELIABLE THE 
TECHNOLOGY IS AND WHETHER 
VULNERABLE CLAIMANTS WILL BE PUT 
OFF APLAYING FOR BENEFITS 
HE IS T. ENOUGH TO TEACH MARTIAL 
ARTS BUT THIS MAN LIKE THOUSANDS 
OF OTHERS THOUGHT HE COULD GET 
AWAY BY CLAIMING DISABILITY BENEFIT 
WHILE WORKING HE WAS CAUGHT ON 
CAMERA BUT FINDING FRAUDSTERS 
ISN'T EASY AND TRADITIONAL METHODS 
OF GATHERING EVIDENCE ARE LENGTHY 
AND TIME CONSUMING 
WE ARE 
SUCCESSFUL IN USING THAT 
INFORMATION AND PROSECUTING AND 
BRINGING PEOPLE TO BOOK BUT THERE 
IS A LONG PROCESS BEHIND THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS 
DETERMINED TO CATCH THOSE WHO ARE 
CHEATING THE SYSTEM OUT OF FOUR HUNDRED 
MILLION EVERY YEAR AND THINKS IT 
HAS FOUND NEW AND BETTER WAY TO 
GET AT THEM 
THE INFORMATION I WILL 
ASK YOU FOR IS TO REVIEW YOUR 
CLAIM ENTER 
LIE DEDETECTORS A YEAR CLAIMENTER AGO THEY WERE INTRODUCED IN SEVEN 
YEARS AND HAVE PROVED SO SUCCESSFUL 
FIFTEEN MORE COUNCILS WILL BE GIVEN THE 
CASH TO INSTALL THE QUI THIS IS 
HOW THE LIE DETECTOR WORKS IT 
RECORDS THE CONVERSATION AND 
FLASHES A WARNING UP ON SCREEN IF 
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN 
THE SOUND OF THE VOICE NOW AT THE 
SAME TIME OPERATORS ARE ALSO 
MAKING NOTES ON WHETHER THAT PERSON 
IS HESITATING IN COMING UP WITH 
ANSWERS OR WHETHER THEY SOUND 
TONGUE TIED OR NERVOUSFUL 
BUT CRITICS ARE CONCERNED THE LIE 
DETECTOR SYSTEM MAY BE FRIGHTENING 
SOME PEOPLE FROM APPLYING FOR MONEY 
THEY COULD LEGITIMATELY CLAIM 
SOMEONE WHO 
IS PRACTISED LIAR WHO IS DELIBERATELY DEFRAUDING THE 
SYSTEM MAY VERY WELL BE ABLE TO 
BEAT EQUIPMENT LIKE THIS WHEREAS 
SOMEONE WHO IS SCRUPULOUSLY HONEST 
MAY BE SCARED OFF CLAIMING 
BENEFIT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO BUT BUT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE SYSTEM IS 
EFFECT EFFECTIVE 
THE IMPORTANT 
THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT 
FLAGS UP A RISK IN THE CALL IT 
DOESN'T PROVE A FRAUD IN ITSELF BUT 
IT IS AN IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL BIT 
OF EQUIPMENT 
IT IS EXPECTED THE 
LIE DETECTORS WILL BE ROLLED OUT 
NATIONALLY THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS 
IT'LL SAVE TAX PAYERS TENS OF 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS A YEAR 
THE BIGGEST SHAKE UP OF THE DRIVING 
TEST IN FIFTY YEARS WILL BE PROPOSED 
BY THE GOVERNMENT TODAY THE IDEA 
IS TO CUT THE GROWING NUMBER OF 
SERIOUS ACCIDENTS INVOLVING YOUNG 
DRIVERS THE TEST WILL BECOME 
TOUGHER AND MORE EXPENSIVE BUT IT 
IS THOUGHT MINIMUM AGE FOR DRIVING 
WILL NOT BE RAISED FROM SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN

AND YOU TOO WILL SEE SUNSHINE AS WE 
GO THROUGH THE DAY 
NOW ON THE SATELLITE PICTURE YOU 
CAN SEE THE AMOUNT OF CLEAR SKIES 
THAT WE HAVE THE CLOUD PUSHING UP 
ACROSS SCOTLAND BUT THERE IS MORE 
CLOUD WHICH WILL COME INTO THE 
SOUTH WEST BUT NOT QUITE YET 
WHAT WE HAVE GOT IN SCOTLAND THIS 
MORNING IS A BEAUTIFUL START TO THE

FINEMENT FOR WALES WE ARE LOOKING 
AT A CRACKING START AS WE ARE IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND TWELVE CELSIUS IN 
BELFAST IS NOT TO BE SNEEZED AT 
NOW THEN THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
DAY WE CONTINUE WITH SOME 
BEAUTIFUL WARM SUNSHINE A LITTLE 
BIT OF CLOUD WILL BUILD UP THROUGH

HALF OF US DON'T BOTHER SPEAKING TO 
OUR NEIGHBOURS WHEN WE PASS THEM ON 
THE STREET EITHER BECAUSE WE DON'T 
KNOW THEM OR CAN'T BE BOTHERED DO 
THE REVELATIONS SHOW BRITAIN THAT 
LOST A SENSE OF COMMUNITY LIFE 
LET'S FIND OUT MORE FROM DAVID 
SILLITO SILLITO GOOD MORNING DAVID WHAT HAVE YOU 
BEEN FINDING 
EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT 
IT A QUIET STREET WHERE ELSE ELSE 
WOULD YOU WANT TO LIVE IN LIFE BUT 
FOR SOME PEOPLE IT MIGHT BE TOO 
QUIET IT SEEMS L. HAVE BEEN TO 
PETERBOROUGH WE JUST CHOSE THESE 
PLACES AT RANDOM JUST TO CHAT TO 
PEOPLE AND WE DID RESEARCH 
BEFOREHAND AND IT FOUND THAT AROUND 
ABOUT A HALF OF US SPEAK TO FEWER 
THAN ONE PERSON A DAY ON OUR STREET 
A HELLO WHICH SURPRISED US IT 
IS MORE IN THE SOUTH EAST IN TERMS 
OF NOT SPEAKING TO YOUR NEIGHBOURS 
THAN IT IS SAY IN SCOTLAND BUT IT 
IS PRETTY MUCH ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
THE SAME SORT OF PATTERN THERE IS 
AND FOR A COUPLE OF PEOPLE I WAS 
SPEAKING TO THEY SEEMED TO THINK 
THAT A QUIET STREET IS O. K. BUT THEY 
ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE DECLINING 
ASPECT OF STREET LIFE 
WE ARE IN HAMPTON IN PETERBOROUGH 
AND JEAN IS TAKING MEGAN OUT FOR 
WALK JEAN IS VERY FRIENDLY 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT YOU MISSED ONE 
GETTING TO KNOW THE NEIGHBOURS IS 
IMPORTANT TO HER BUT AROUND HERE 
IT HAS BEEN HARD 
HI HI IF YOU CAN'T GET IN TOUCH IF YOU 
CAN'T GET BEYOND THE BRICK WALL 
YOU CAN'T HELP ANYBODY 
IT IS LIKE ME I AM FRIENDLY AND I 
DO SAY HELLO L. ALWAYS SAY HI YA 
IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY WHAT DO YOU 
WANT I DON'T KNOW YOU 
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAS SHE BEEN ABLE 
TO SAY HELLO TO HER IN HER STREET 
IN THE LAST WEEK 
FOUR FOUR FOUR IN THE PAST WEEK 
GOOD OR BAD 
VERY SAD 
I CARRIED ON WALKING AND WALKING 
AND WALKING EVENTUALLY I PASSED A 
PERSON PERSON IT IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN 
AROUND HERE THOUGHT THERE MIGHT 
BE ONE PERSON TO SAY HELLO AS YOU 
WALK PAST 
NO NO EVERYBODY IS AWAY DOING 
THEIR OWN LITTLE BUSINESS AREN'T 
THEY 
THAT'S IT WE'VE WALKED THEY AROUND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND I 
BUMPED INTO ONE PERSON 
AND IT WEAN JUST ME IT WASN'T 
JUST ME I MANAGE TODAY FIND A FEW 
PEOPLE TO HAVE A CHAT TO 
IN THE LAST WEEK HOW MANY OF YOUR 
NEIGHBOURS HAVE YOU SAID HELLO TO 
IN THE STREET ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE TWO YEAH PROBABLY TWOMENT 
NO ONE 
SO PEOPLE KEEP THEMSELVES TO 
THEMSELVES SO WHAT WELL IT IS A 
PROBLEM FOR JOAN SHE IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR NEIGHBOURHOOD 
RELATIONS IN THE TOWN'S PUBLIC 
HOUSING HOUSING I THINK PEOPLE HAVE JUST LOST THE 
ABILITY TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND 
THEY HAVE LOST THAT FEELING OF 
SAYING GOOD MORNING 
THEY HAVE TO CALL YOU IN TO SORT 
THEIR PROBLEMS OUT 
YES AND WE SAY 
TO PEOPLE HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO YOUR 
NEIGHBOUR ABOUT THE ISSUE ABOUT 
PARKING OR THE OVERFLOWING BIN 
NO WE HAVEN'T WHY NOT THAT'S 
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO WE ARE 
TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO START 
COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER 
IT REACHED SUCH POINT SHE NOW 
GETS TENANTS TO SIGN THIS 
YOU HAVE TO GET THEM TO SIGN 
PIECE OF PAPER TO GET THEM TO TALK 
TO ONE ANOTHER 
IN SOME CASES YES 
FOR JEAN THE FRIENDLY HELLO IS AN 
ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE HAPPY LIFE 
LIFE BUT THIS IS MODERN BRITAIN 
PLACE CARS AND CLOSED DOORS 
SOCIETY IN WHICH HALF OF US DON'T 
MANAGE AT LEAST ONE FRIENDLY 
GREETING A DAY WITH THE NEIGHBOUR 
ON OUR OWN STREET 
THAT'S VERY SAD 
IT IS SAD 
I'M SURE SOME PEOPLE WILL RECOGNISE 
THAT PICTURE OTHERS WON'T 
I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK THE REASONS 
FOR THIS YOU HAVE SCHOOL AGE 
CHILDREN YOU GENERALLY KNOW THE 
PEOPLE ON YOUR STREET BECAUSE YOU 
ARE WALKING THEM TO SCHOOL AND BACK 
HOW MANY ARE FERRIED TO AND FROM 
THEIR SCHOOLS IN CARS 
RIGHT RIGHT THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD LOVELY 
NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE IS NOTHING 
WRONG WITH IT FOR A LOT OF HOUSES 
THE CAR PARKING IS BEHIND THE HOUSE 
YOU GET INTO THE CAR AND YOU GO 
STRAIGHT OUT AND EVERYTHING YOU DO 
IN LIFE IS CAR'S JOURNEY AWAY SO 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN MANY CASES 
HOWEVER IT IS NOT BLEAK 
PICTURE HALF OF US ARE SPEAKING TO 
FEWER THAN SIX PEOPLE WEEK HALF 
OF US ARE SPEAKING TO MORE AND YOU 
LOOK AT CERTAIN PLACES WELL THEY 
ARE SPEAKING TO TWENTY PEOPLE 
WEEK EVERY TIME THEY WALK DOWN THE 
STREET THEY ARE SAYING HELLO THIS 
ISN'T WHAT IS HAPPENING EVERYWHERE 
IN BRITAIN BUT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 
THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION 
OF THINKING WELL WE SEEN THESE 
OLD PICTURES OF WHAT LIFE USED TO 
BE LIKE AND IT IS THE THING THAT 
ALWAYS STANDS OUT THERE ARE PEOPLE 
EVERYWHERE THERE ARE CHILDREN IN 
THE STREET AND PEOPLE IN FRONT 
GARDENS HOW MANY FRONT GARDENS 
HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO PARKING HOW 
WE HAVE RETREAT FROM THE STREET AND 
BECOME NERVOUS OF THE PEOPLE WHO 
LIVE AROUND US MY PIECE TOMORROW 
WHICH IS ABOUT CHILDREN AND WHERE 
THEY HAVE DISAPPEARED TO 
I WAS ON A RUN LAST NIGHT I WENT 
THROUGH LOCAL VILLAGE AND THERE 
WAS NO CHILDREN ANYWHERE AND IT WAS 
LIKE THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY 
BRED IN CAPTIVITY 
DAVID YOU RAISE SO MANY 
INTERESTING ISSUES AND WE WILL TALK 
TO YOU LATER ON 
IF YOU HAVE GOT THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS 
LET US KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU 
EXPECT TO SPEAK TO DURING THE DAY 
LET US KNOW IF YOU BORROW NEXT NEXT 
DOOR NEIGHBOUR'S LAWN MOWER OR

BE UPGRADED FROM CLASS C. WHERE 
POSSESSION IS TREATED LARGELY A A 
NONE ARRESTABLE OFFENCE TO CLASS 
BBUT THIS NEWS COMES ON THE DAY 
THAT AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW SAYS IT 
SHOULD NOT CHANGE 
MOVING IT BACK 
TO CLASS B. WILL DRIVE IT FURTHER 
UNDERGROUND WHICH MEANS LESS 
CONTROL AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL 
ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS THE ONLY 
THING IT'LL DO IS PERSECUTE MYSELF 
AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO 
BASICALLY USE CANNABIS IN THE 
PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN HOME WITHOUT 
HURTING ANYONE

GOVERNMENT THE IDEA IS TO CUT THE 
GROWING NUMBER OF SERIOUS ACCIDENTS

BLIND SPOT WAS WHICH IS IMPORTANT 
ACCORDING TO MY INSTRUCTOR 
DID YOU 
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS NOW 
IT IS THE BIT WHERE YOU CLOSE YOUR 
EYES I PASSED EVERYTHING ELSE I 
COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE DRIVING 
INSTRUCTOR ASKED ME TO PULL AWAY TWENTY FIVE

SCOTTISH FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION MET 
WITH THE S. P. L. YESTERDAY BUT NEITHER

IS DOING DAMAGE 
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THAT 
PEOPLE ARE JUST SAYING THAT THERE 
IS NO SUPPORT FOR A TEAM IN THE 
EUROPEAN FINAL AND THAT'S GOING 
ACROSS EUROPE THE WORLD AT THE 
MOMENT AND THERE WILL BE A CERTAIN 
ALTHOUGH OF DAMAGE TO THE 
REPUTATION OF THE GAME BECAUSE OF 
THAT

TIER TIER CARL LEWIS HAS CALLED ON GOVERNMENT 
AROUND THE WORLD TO MAKE USE OF 
BANNED SUBSTANCES IN SPORT IN 
CRIMINAL OFFENCE HE WON NINE 
OLYMPIC GOLDS AND EIGHT WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND HE HAS TOLD THE

HELP SAVE THE REPUTATION HE ALSO 
HAD HARSH WORDS 
WE HAVE TO JOIN

ATHLETES WHEN I COMPETED I SPOKE 
OUT VEHEMENTLY AGAINST DRUGS AND I 
WAS CALLED A TATTLE TALE LOOK 
WHERE OUR SPORT ENDED UP WHEN 
PEOPLE START DOING IT L. THEY THEY 
OUGHT TO COME TO THE WHEN THEY DID 
WITH MARION JONES THEY USED THE 
GOVERNMENT I WOULD CHANGE LAWS IF 
YOU TEST POSITIVE WHY CAN'T IT BE 
ILLEGAL SO WE HAVE TO GET YOU UNDER 
OATH AND GET THE TRUTH DWAIN DWAIN CHAMBERS TOLD US THAT YOU HAVE TO 
CHEAT TO WIB 
HE DIDN'T HAVE TALENT 
HE HAD TO TAKE DRUGS HE HAD TO 
CHEAT UE I'M TIRED OF THESE PEOPLE 
WHO DON'T HAVE TALENT TAKE DRUGS

MOST ATHLETES ARE CLEAN AND DO IT 
RIGHT THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE 
THE TALENT TAKE DRUGS 
WELL DWAIN 
CHAMBERS IS WORKING OUT WHAT TO DO 
NEXT AS AFTER CASTLEFORD RUGBY 
LEAGUE CLUB DECIDED NOT TO OFFER

TRIED HIS HAND AT RUGBY LEAGUE 
AFTER BEING FROZEN OUT OF ATHLETES 
CASTLEFORD SAY THEY HAVEN'T THE 
TIME TO SEE IF HE CAN MAKE THE 
GRADE NEWPORT GWENT DRAGONS HAVE 
CLAIMED A MAGNIER'S LEAGUE WIN 
THEY BEAT OSPREYS EIGHTEEN TO TEN AND ARE 
SEVENTH IN THE TABLE 
I WILL BE BACK LATER 
HE WASN'T PULLING HIS PUNCHES CARL 
LEWIS 
NO IN DWAIN CHAMBERS GOOD LEWIS TO SEE CAPELLO'S ENGLISH COMING ON 
WELL HIS LIPS DON'T COINCIDE HOW HOW IS YOUR ITALIAN 
VERY GOOD 
SEE YOU LATER 
THE TIME IS SIX HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT 
A MAJOR SHAKE UP OF THE DRIVING 
TEST AND RULES FOR NEWLY QUALIFIED 
DRIVERS IS TO BE ANNOUNCED TODAY IN 
ORDER TO TRY TO CUT THE NUMBER OF 
ACCIDENTS INVOLVING YOUNG MOTORISTS 
ACCORD TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE 
PREVENTION OF ACCIDENTS NEARLY 
THREE THOUSAND DRIVERS UNDER FIVE ARE KILLED OR 
SERIOUSLY INJURED EVERY YEAR WITH 
ONE IN FIVE CRASHING IN THEIR FIRST 
YEAR OF DRIVING THE GOVERNMENT IS 
GOING TO LOOK AT WERE POSALS LIKE 
BANNING DRIVERS UNDER TWENTY FROM BEING 
ON THE ROAD AT TIME TIME OR 
CARRYING FELLOW TEENAGE PASSENGERS 
AND ALSO CHANGING THE TEST SO IT 
INCLUDES MORE REAL LIFE DRIVING 
SITUATIONS LISA DORNE IS FROM 
ALPHA TO OMEGA MOTORING DRIVING 
SCHOOL YOU AIM TO TRAIN MORE YOUNG 
DRIVERS MUCH MORE YOUR AVERAGE 
DRIVING SCHOOL WHAT DO YOU TEACH 
THEM 
IT IS ABOUT ALL THE RISKS OF THEM DRIVING ONE OF THE PROBLEMS ABOUT 
THE TEST IS THAT IT IS ABOUT THE 
MECHANICAL ASPECTS OF SKILL BUT 
ACTUALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 
RESEARCH THERE IS A LOT OF 
EVIDENCE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF 
THE PROBLEMS IS TO DO WITH DRIVER 
BEHAVIOUR DECISION MAKING THE 
ATTITUDES DRIVERS HAVE SO YOU 
REALLY NEED TO EDUCATE THEM FROM A 
MUCH MORE WHOLISTIC PERFECTIVE AND 
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DONE THEY HAVE 
CREATED A GCSE EQUIVALENT TO MAKE 
SURE ALL THE PRACTICAL TERMS ARE 
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT 
WHAT DO YOU 
MEAN 
WE HAVE THE AFFECT OF DRUGS MEAN LOOK AT THAT IN THE USE YOUNG 
DRIVERS ARE NOT AWARE WHAT IMPACT 
THAT HAS ON DECISION MAKING WE 
LOOK AT WEATHER CONDITIONS DRIVING 
ON THE MOTORWAY HOW TO RESPOND TO 
EMERGENCY VEHICLES THERE ARE SO 
MANY THINGS THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY 
NOT EDUCATED ABOUT 
THERE IS A 
SUGGESTION ALSO THAT THE BRAINS 
OF TEENAGERS AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN ARE 
STILL DEVELOPING SO THEY CAN'T 
REALLY TAKE EVERYTHING INTO THAT 
THEY NEED TO IS THAT CORRECT 
ABSOLUTELY RECENT RESEARCH HAS 
SHOWN THAT THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH 
YOU CAN INCREASE THE MATURATION 
LEVEL OF THE BRAIN WHAT WE HAVE 
DONE IS CREATED TECHNOLOGY THAT 
ALLOWS THOSE PARTS OF THE BRAIN TO 
BE DEVELOPED SUCH AS EXECUTIVE 
DECISION MAKING RISK MANAGING 
THERE IS HOST OF SKILLS 
DOES IT 
HAPPEN ON A COMPUTER 
YES IT IS A 
COMPUTER BASED FOR EXAMPLE EYE 
SCANNING THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN 
SHAH YOUNG DRIVERS JUST LOOK A FEW 
FEET FROM THEIR BONNET THEY DON'T 
SCAN AROUND VERY WELL THE 
TECHNOLOGY MAKES SURE THEY MOVE 
THEIR EYES 
AND THE CHANGES THAT WE 
MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
INTERVIEW DO YOU THINK THEY WILL 
BE ENOUGH TO CUT THE NUMBER OF 
ACCIDENTS INVOLVING YOUNG PEOPLE 
WELL I THINK THE CHANGES ARE LONG 
OVERDUE MUCH IT IS OVER FIFTY YEARS 
SINCE THE DRIVING TEST WAS 
INTRODUCED THIS IS MODEST CHANGES 
I THINK IT PUTS US IN THE RIGHT 
BALLPARK BUT THERE IS AN AWFUL LOT 
MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE I'M 
PARENT MYSELF YOU KNOW I WANT TO 
MAKE SURE THAT MY DAUGHTER GETS THE 
BEST EDUCATION IN LEARNING TO DRIVE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH L. KNOW YOU ARE 
COMING BACK AGAIN IN AN HOUR'S TIME 
WITH QUENTIN WILLSON L. LOOK 
FORWARD TO TALKING TO YOU AGAIN 
THEN THEN AND WE WILL SPEAK TO THE MOTORING 
JOORNLIST QUENTIN WILLSON 
FOUR DAYS AFTER THE DEVASTATING 
CYCLONE STRUCK BURMA AID IS 
BEGINNING TO TRICKLE INTO THE 
COUNTRY AID AGENCIES ARE WAITING 
FOR BURMA'S MILITARY RULERS 
OFFICIALLY TO OPEN THEIR BORDERS 
JAMES EAST IS FROM THE CHARITY 
WORLD VISION AND WE CAN TALK TO HIM 
NOW IN BANGKOK GOOD MORNING 
THREW THERE WERE CONCERNS THAT AID 
MIGHT NOT GET INTO BURMA JUST GIVE 
US AN IDEA OF WHETHER THAT AID 
BEING ABLE TO GET THROUGH AND BEING 
DISTRIBUTED TO THE RIGHT AREAS 
WELL WE ARE FORTUNATE IN THAT WE 
HAVE FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY STAFF IN COUNTRY ALREADY 
AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE 
COUNTRY FOR DECADES WE HAVE 
ALREADY BEEN DISTRIBUTING THOUSANDS 
OF LITRES OF WATER AND THOUSANDS OF 
K. G. OF RICE AS WELL AS CLOTHING 
WITHIN THE YANGON AREA WE WOULD 
LIKE TO BRING IN MORE AID WE HAVE 
AID WAITING TO BRING IN WE ARE 
HOPING IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO 
HAVE DECISION ON THAT 
AND WHAT 
DECISIONS NEED TO BE MADE IN ORDER 
FOR THAT AID TO GET THROUGH WELL 
WE HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH THE 
MINISTRY OF SOCIAL WELFARE ONE OF 
THE THINGS THEY ARE CLEAR THAT THEY 
WOULD LIKE US TO DO IS TO PROO 
PROVIDE A CLEAR IDEA OF HOW WE WANT 
TO WORK 
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
WORKING IN FIVE AREAS IN THE WORST 
FAEBED AREA WHICH IS THIS DELTA 
REGION WE HAVE THE WORST AFFECTED 
AREA WE HAVE STAFF THERE AT THE 
MOMENT DOING ASSESSMENTS PROBABLY 
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS THEY WILL 
BE ON THE GROUND AND MAYBE BY 
TOMORROW WE WILL HAVE A BETTER IDEA 
OF WHAT IS NEEDED 
I WONDER ARE 
YOU GETTING HINDERED IN ANYWAY IN 
GETTING AID THROUGH PRESUMABLY YOU 
WOULD LIKE IT ALL TO GO IN AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLE AND BE DISTRIBUTED ARE 
YOU FINDING YOU ARE HAVING TO JUMP 
THROUGH HOOPS IN ORDER TO GET IT 
SORTED OUT 
WE ARE USED TO DEALING 
WITH THESE CONTEXTS IN MANY WAYS 
IT IS PAR FOR THE U. R. S. COULD AS I 
SAY WE ARE LUCKY TO BE ON THE 
GROUND AND READY IT IS PAR FOR 
THE COURSE WE HAVE A 
PREPOSITIONING UNIT IN BANGKOK WE 
HAVE TAURPAUL LIN KITS TO HELP 
PEOPLE RECOVER IT IS READY TO FLY 
IN THE OTHER THING WE ARE KEEN TO 
GET IN WATER PURIFICATION UNITS IN 
ORDER TO PROVIDE PURE WATER FOR 
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW DRIFPBGING DIRTY 
WATER 
DRINKING DIRTY WATER WATER THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS IS 
BREAKFAST THE MAIN STORIES 
GOVERNMENT MINISTERS EXPECTED TO 
REJECT THEIR OWN EXPERTS' ADVICE BY 
RECLASSIFYING CANNABIS AS A MORE 
DANGEROUS DRUG 
AID AGENCIES APPEAL TO BURMA TO 
OPEN ITS BORDERS SO THEY CAN HELP 
SURVIVORS OF THE CYCLONE THAT HAS 
LEFT ZERO DEAD ALSO COME UP MORE 
COUNCILS GET THE GREEN LIGHT TO USE 
THESE LIE DETECTOR TESTS WE WILL 
LOOK AT THE IMPACT ON BENEFIT FRAUD 
IT WAS JUST BLISTERING SUNSHINE 
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON IN THE GARDEN 
LET'S SEE WHAT THE WEATHER HAS 
IN 
STORE STORE IT CERTAINLY WAS YESTERDAY ACROSS 
MUCH OF THE U. K. THE HIGHEST 
TEMPERATURE WAS IN NOTTINGHAM AND 
THAT WAS TWENTY FIVE CELSIUS 
WE COULD SEE THE SAME AGAIN TODAY 
IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THE 
FORECAST IS ANOTHER SUNNY AND AND 
WARM ONE IF IT IS NOT SUNNY WHERE 
YOU ARE AT THE MOMENT THE CHANCES 
ARE IT WILL BE ON THE SATELLITE 
PICTURE YOU CAN SEE THE CLOUD 
MOVING ACROSS SCOTLAND WHAT WE 
HAVE ACROSS ABERDEENSHIRE PERTH 
AND AND AND KIND ROSS IS FOG 
SUNNY ACROSS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
AND SUNNY AS WE WHIP DOWN TOWARDS 
THE SOUTH COAST LIKE YESTERDAY ON 
THE EAST COAST THERE IS MORE OF A 
BREEZE SO THAT'S TAKING THE EDGE OF 
THE TEMPERATURES BUT YOU DON'T 
HAVE TO MOVE FAR INLAND AND THE 
TEMPERATURES SHOOT UP FOR CORNWALL 
A BIT OF CLOUD ON THE TIP CLOUD 
TOO ACROSS THE ISLES OF SCILLY FOR 
THE REST OF THE SOUTH WEST WE ARE 
LOOKING AT A BEAUTIFUL AND NOT A 
COLD START TO THE DAY ANOTHER 
THING WORTH MENTIONING IS THE 
POLLEN INDEX IS HIGH TODAY WE ARE 
LOOKING AT TREE POLLEN AND MORE 
PARTICULARLY AT BIRCH IF YOU 
SUFFER FROM THAT BEAR IT IN MIND 
THROUGH TODAY WE CONTINUE WITH THE 
SUNSHINE IT COULD BE THICK ENOUGH 
TO PRODUCE A SHOWER IT IS JUST A 
RISK AND TEMPERATURES HIGH FOR THE 
TIME OF THE YEAR 
THROUGH THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT 
AGAIN A LOT OF CLEAR SKIES ON THE 
SHORES OF THE EAST OF SCOTLAND 
POSSIBLY THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND 
WE COULD SEE SOME COASTAL MIST AND 
FOG NOT AS MUCH AS WE HAVE THIS 
MORNING AND NOT A COLD NIGHT 
TOMORROW ALMOST A REPEAT 
PERFORMANCE OF TODAY IT WILL BE 
ANOTHER GLORIOUS DAY WHEN WE LOSE 
ANY MIST AND FOG PATCHES THAT WILL 
HAPPEN READILY AND LATER IN THE DAY 
THE CLOUD WILL THICKEN IN THE 
SOUTH WEST AND LATER ON WE WILL 
HAVE SHOWERY OUTBREAKS OF RAIN BUT 
NOTHING WRONG WITH THE TEMPERATURES 
AT ALL 
LET'S LOOK AT THE PAPERS 
IT MAKES THE POLLEN RISE AND I 
START SNIFFING 
LET'S LOOK AT THE HEADLINES THE 
DAILY TELEGRAPH SAYS THE AVERAGE 
MOTORIST IS PAYING AN EXTRA SIX HUNDRED 
YEAR IN TAX UNDER LABOUR 
THE TIMES HAS GOT A POLL SAYING 
MORE THAN HALF OF LABOUR SUPPORTERS 
BELIEVE GORDON BROWN SHOULD STAND 
DOWN TO MAKE WAY FOR A MORE MORE 
ELECTABLE ALTERNATIVE 
THIS IS THE VOLCANO YOU GET YOUR 
LARVA AND SMOKE AND LIGHTENING 
THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED WAS NINE THOUSAND 
YEARS AGO 
THE GUARDIAN MORE PRESSURE FOR 
GORDON BROWN HE IS FACING FRESH 
BATTLES ON THREE FRONTS SCOTTISH 
INDEPENDENCE INDEPENDENCE 
THE WARNING GIVEN TO GORDON BROWN 
BY CABINET MINISTERS 
THE INDEPENDENT FOCUSING ON WHAT IS 
HAPPENING THIS BURMA ONE MILLION 
PEOPLE LEFT HOMELESS THEY ARE 
SAYING THAT THE BURMESE ARE 
OBSTRUGGING LOCAL OBSTRUCTING 
LOCAL EFFORTS 
FAMILIES HAVE LESS TO SPEND ON 
THEMSELVES THAN ANY TIME IN SIXTEEN 
YEARS AND A PICTURE OF POSH AS AS YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE 
IN ALL THE PHOTOGRAPHS SHE IS NOT 
SMILING SMILING SHE NEVER SMILES 
THE DAILY MIRROR LOOKING AT MORE 
ALLEGATIONS FROM AUSTRIA AND THE 
PAPER CLAIMS THE SON IN LAW OF 
JOSEF FRITZL DOING INTERVIEWS NOW 
INSIDE THE DAILY MAIL SHE IS NOT 
SMILING SMILING THEY SAY LIKE HER SMILE THE LOOK 
THAT CLEARLY NEEDS WORK I THINK 
SHE LOOKS LOVELY 
SHALL WE GO OVER TO AARON 
SHE LOOKS LOVELY SHALL WE GO OVER TO AARON 
SHALL WE GO OVER TO AARON I'M SMILING AND SHE LOOKED GOOD 
WE ARE SEEING FIGURES TODAY AND THE 
LATEST FIGURES ON HOW CONFIDENT WE 
FEEL ABOUT OUR ECONOMY AND OF 
COURSE THEY DON'T MAKE MUCH FOR 
PRETTY READING 
IN FACT THE NATIONWIDE CONSUMER 
CONFIDENCE INDEX HAS FALLEN TO ITS 
LOWEST POINT IN FOUR YEARS AND IT 
INDICATES WE ARE SEEING OUR 
SPENDING HABITS CHANGING AND WE ARE 
SEEING A BOOM IN SALES AT BUDGET 
STORES LIKE PRIMARK AS WELL AS THE 
GERMAN SUPERMAR ARE KET CHAIN 
MARKET CHAIN ALDI 
WE OF COURSE HIT THE STREETS TO 
ASK YOU IF YOU ARE SCALING BACK ON 
YOUR BRANDS 
I THINK IF I'M IN A SUPERMARKET I 
GO FOR A BRAND THAT I LIKE AND I 
DON'T LIKE THE PRICE I DON'T 
LOOK AT THE PRICE 
IF THERE IS TWO FOR ONES I BUY 
BULK BULK L. BUY LOT OF STUFF ONLINE 
DON'T GET FOOLED IN BY THE SALES 
BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE 
REAL SEAMS SEAMS SALES L. THINK 
IT IS A LURE TO ATTRACT PEOPLE INTO 
THE SHOPS 
I BUDGET MORE AND BUY THE THINGS 
THAT I NEED NOT THE THINGS I WANT 
VINCE MITCHELL JOINS US TYPICALLY 
WE NEED SOME TYPE OF SHOCK OR JOLT 
TO CHANGE OUR SPENDING HABITS HAS 
THE PAST THREE TO SIX MONTHS 
PROVIDED THAT JOLT 
IT HAS THE 
GLOOM AND DOOM AROUND NOW MEANS WE 
HAVE GOT A DIFFERENT MINDSET NOW 
WE HAVE BECOME V. W. VALUE VOX 
WHICH BRANDS DO WE TEND TO BUY WHEN 
MONEY IS TIGHT 
THOSE WELL KNOWN 
BRANDS BRANDS SUCH AS TESCO THE 
NOKIA THE BRANDS THAT ARE WELL 
TRUSTED THE BRANDS THAT WILL 
SUFFER ARE THE BRANDS WE DON'T LIKE 
THE A. O. L.'S AND MCDONALD TYPE BRANDS 
THE BRANDS WE LIKE WILL CONTINUE TO 
THRIVE 
SOME NEW RISES THRIVE WHEN ARE WOMEN GOING TO SCALE BACK 
ON THEIR CLOTHING CHARITY CHIC 
YOU WILL SEE THE RISE OF CHARITY 
THE FEEL GOOD SPEND OF HELPING THE 
CHARITY AND GETTING A NEW TOP LIKE 
THIS IT IS A CHARITY SHIRT 
BRIEFLY PEOPLE CAN SAVE BY 
SHOPPING THIS WAY 
OH ABSOLUTELY 
AND FEELING GOOD AT THE SAME TIME 
THAT'S THE KEY IN TIMES OF GLOOM 
AND DOOM 
VINCE MITCHELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
GUYS YOU HEARD IT HERE NOT THAT 
YOU TWO OF COURSE APPLY TO THIS 
SHABBY CHIC IT IS GOING TO BE IN

THE WAY WE GARDEN NOW EVERYONE 
WANTS EVERYTHING INSTANTLY BECAUSE 
OF THE PROGRAMMES

YOU ARE BUYING BIGGER PLANTS THEY 
ARE SAFER BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE 
DIFFICULT TO MOVE BECAUSE THEY ARE 
SO HEAVY

CHEAP BUT I CAN'T SEE THE POINT OF 
TAKING TURF AT ALL THAT'S JUST

WHERE POSSESSION IS TREATED AS A 
NONE ARRESTABLE OFFENCE TO CLASS B. 
GORDON BROWN HAS INDICATED HE WANTS 
TO SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT THE 
USE OF CANNABIS IS UNACCEPTABLE 
BUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT COMES ON THE 
DAY WHEN AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW SAYS 
IT SHOULDN'T CHANGE THE LAWS ON 
CANNABIS ARE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 
AT THE FORENSIC SCIENCE SERVICE 
LABORATORY IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE THEY 
FIND THAT CANNABIS IS MORE POWERFUL 
THAN BEFORE AND THE STRONGER 
STRENGTH TYPE OF CANNABIS SKUNK 
IS MORE WIDESPREAD HOME OFFICE 
RESEARCH SUGGEST IT ACCOUNTS FOR 
EIGHTY PER CENT OF SAMPLE SEIZED CANNABIS CANNABIS CULTIVATORS HAVE DEVELOPED HIGHER 
STRENGTH STRAINS OF CANNABIS THAT'S 
TYPICALLY GROWN INDOORS UNDER 
ARTIFICIAL CONDITIONS AND IT IS 
THESE HIGHER STRENGTH STRAINS THAT 
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASE IN 
THE DRUG STRENGTH STRONGER STRONGER CANNABIS AND THE RISK OF DEVELOPING 
MENTAL ILLNESS LED SOME OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S DRUGS ADVISORS TO CALL 
FOR CANNABIS TO BE RESTORED TO 
CLASS B. BUT MOST SAID IT SHOULD 
REMAIN A CLASS C. DRUG WITH THE 
MAXIMUM PENALTY FOR POSSESSION IS 
TWO YEARS RATHER THAN FIVE 
THE DRAFT REPORT SAYS 
IF THEY GO AGAINST THE ADVICE OF 
THEIR ADVISORY BODY IT WOULD BE A 
MISTAKE IT COULD SEND OUT SIGNAL 
THAT RATHER THAN BASE DRUGS POLICY 
ON EVIDENCE IT CAN BE DRIVEN BY 
POLITICAL HEAD LUENS AND SOME 
EXAGGERATED MEDIA COVERAGE MAN MAN CANNABIS USERS HAVE BEEN SPOKE 
SMOKING THE DRUG WITHOUT ILL 
AFFECTS FOR YEARS BUT THE COUNCIL 
SAYS THE YOUNG PEOPLE MUST BE MADE 
AWARE OF THE DANGERS 
INTERNATIONAL AID AGENCIES ARE 
WAITING FOR BURMA'S MILITARY RULERS 
TO OPEN THEIR BORDERS THE CYCLONE 
HAS KILLED MORE THAN FOUR MILLION TWENTY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE AND FORTY THOUSAND ARE MISSING 
AROUND ONE MILLION PEOPLE ARE LEFT 
WITHOUT SHELTER AND IN NEED OF FOOD 
AND WATER HUNDREDS OF THOSE OF 
PEOPLE IN BURMA ARE NOW ENJOYING 
THEIR FIFTH DAY CUT OFF FROM THE 
OUTSIDE WORLD STRANDED ACROSS THE 
IRRAWADDY DELTA WAITING FOR RELIEF 
INTERNATIONAL AID HAS BEEN 
STRIKELING INTO THE COUNTRY BUT 
NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE KNOWN TO BE 
DEAD MANY MORE ARE MISSING AND 
PERHAPS ONE MILLION ARE WITHOUT 
FOOD AND SHELTER THE TRUE SCALE OF 
THIS DISASTER IS YET TO EMERGE 
MANY ROADS ARE STILL BLOCKED BY 
FALLEN TREES AND DEBRIS THE 
GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE 
RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THIS 
CATASTROPHE BUT IS STILL RELUCTANT 
TO OPEN THE DOOR FULLY TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL AID TEAMS WAITING 
OUTSIDE 
WE HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH OUTSIDE THE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL WELFARE ONE 
OF THE THINGS THEY WOULD LIKE US TO 
DO IS TO PROVIDE A CLEAR IDEA OF 
HOW WE WOULD WANT TO WORK WE HAVE 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT WORKING IN FIVE 
AREAS IN THE WORST AFFECTED REGION 
OF YANGON THIS DELTA REGION 
ENTIRE VILLAGES AND TOWNS WERE 
WIPED OUT BY THE TIDAL SURGE 
CAUSED BY SATURDAY'S CYCLONE THE 
FEAR IS THE LONGER THE AID GROUPS 
ARE DELAYED THE WORST THE RISK OF 
DISEASE TAKING HOLD IN A COUNTRY 
WITH AN ALREADY FRAGILE HEALTH CARE 
SYSTEM FEW MONTHS AGO WE TOLD YOU 
LIE DETECTORS ARE BEING TRIED OUT 
TO TRAP BENEFIT CHEATS COSTING THE 
COUNTRY UP TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION YEAR 
AFTER SUCCESSFUL TRIALS THEY ARE 
TO BE ROLLED OUT TO MORE COUNCILS 
BUT THERE ARE QUESTIONS OVER HOW 
SUCCESSFUL IT IS AND WHETHER REAL 
CLAIMANTS WILL BE PUT OFF APPLYING 
FOR BENEFITS MUCH TEST MIT ENOUGH 
TO TEACH MARTIAL ARTS BUT THIS MAN 
LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS THOUGHT 
HE COULD GET AWAY WITH CLAIMING 
DISABLE BENEFIT WHILE WORKING 
FINDING FRAUDSTERS ISN'T EASY AND 
TRADITIONAL METHODS OF GATHERING 
EVIDENCE ARE LENGTHY AND TIME 
CONSUMING 
WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN CONSUMING USING THAT INFORMATION AND 
PROSECUTING AND BRINGING PEOPLE TO 
BOOK BUT THERE IS A LONG PROCESS 
BEHIND THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT 
IS DETERMINED TO CATCH THOSE WHO 
ARE CHEATING THE SYSTEM OUT OF FOUR HUNDRED 
MILLION EVERY YEAR AND THINKS IT 
HAS FOUND A NEW AND BETTER WAY TO 
GET AT THEM 
THE INFORMATION I'M 
GOING TO ASK YOU FOR IS NEEDED TO 
REVIEW YOUR CLAIM 
ENTER LIE 
DETECTORS A YEAR AGO THEY WERE 
INTRODUCED IN SEVEN AREAS THEY 
HAVE PROVEN SO SUCCESSFUL FIFTEEN MORE 
COUNCILS WILL BE GIVEN THE CASH TO 
INSTALL THE EQUIPMENT THIS IS HOW 
THE LIE DETECTOR WORK IT RECORDS 
THE CONVERSATION AND FLASHES A 
WARNING UP ON SCREEN IF THERE IS A 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IF THE SOUND OF 
THE VOICE NOW AT THE SAME TIME 
OPERATORS ARE ALSO MAKING NOTES ON 
WHETHER THAT PERSON IS HESITATING 
IN COMING UP WITH ANSWERS OR 
WHETHER THEY SOUND TONGUE TIED OR 
NERVOUS NERVOUS BUT CRITICS ARE CONCERNED THE LIE 
DETECTOR SYSTEM MAY BE FRIGHTENING 
SOME PEOPLE FROM APPLYING FOR MONEY 
THEY COULD LEGITIMATELY CLAIM 
SOMEONE 
WHO IS PRACTISED LIAR WHO IS DELIBERATELY DEFRAUDING THE 
SYSTEM MAY VERY WELL BE ABLE TO 
BEAT EQUIPMENT LIKE THIS WHEREAS 
SOMEONE WHO IS SCRUPULOUSLY HONEST 
MAY ACTUALLY BE SCARED OFF CLAIMING 
A BENEFIT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO BUT BUT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE SYSTEM IS 
EFFECTIVE 
AN IMPORTANT THING TO EFFECTIVE UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT FLAGS UP A 
RISK IT DOESN'T PROVE A FRAUD IN 
ITSELF BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT 
ADDITIONAL BIT OF TOOLING FOR US 
IT IS EXPECTED THE LIE DETECTORS 
WILL EVENTUALLY BE ROLLED OUT 
NATIONALLY THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS 
THIS'LL SAVE TAX PAYERS TENS OF 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS YEAR 
IN FEW MINUTES WE WILL SPEAK TO 
THE ANTI FRAUD MINISTER JAMES PLAS 
KET YOU SAW HIM IN THAT REPORT 
TO AMERICA WHERE BARACK OBAMA IS 
THE HAPPIER OF THE TWO DEMOCRATIC 
PRESIDENTAL HOPEFULS THIS MORNING 
HE WON COMFORTABLABLY IN THE 
PRIMARY IN NORTH CAROLINE YAFLT 
CLINTON CLIN JUST SCRAPED HOME IN 
INDIANA NORTH CAROLINA 
GOOD MORNING JONATHAN 
A SEEINGLY 
NEVER ENDING CONTEST THAT STARTED 
FOUR MONTHS AGO ON THE SNOWY PLAINS 
OF IOWA IS STILL NOT DECIDED 
HAVING SAID THAT THE LIKELY OUTCOME 
IS BECOMING CLEARER REMEMBER 
AFTER PENNSYLVANIA HILLARY CLINTON 
SAID THE TIDE WAS TURNING BUT 
AFTER INDIANA WHERE SHE HAD THE 
NARROWEST OF WINS AND NORTH 
CAROLINA WHERE HE HAD A CONVINCING 
VICTORY THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE 
THE CASE IN FACT BARACK OBAMA 
WHO HAS BEEN ON THE ROPES HAS 
SUDDENLY DRAMATICALLY REGAINED 
THE MOM UM 
HE HADN'T WON A BIG 
STATE FOR MOTHER THAN TWO MONTHS 
HE HAS BEEN UNDER FIRE AND ON THE 
DEFENSIVE BUT BARACK OBAMA'S 
CONVINCING WIN IN NORTH CAROLINA 
HAS CHANGED THE MOOD WHY BECAUSE 
HILLARY CLINTON HAD RAISED THE 
STAKES 
THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE STAKES SAYING THAT NORTH CAROLINA WOULD BE 
A GAME CHANGER IN THIS ELECTION 
BUT TODAY WHAT NORTH CAROLINA 
DECIDED IS THAT THE ONLY GAME THAT 
NEEDS CHANGING IS THE ONE IN 
WASHINGTON D. C. 
ONCE AGAIN THEY ARE SHOUTING IT 
WITH CONVICTION IN THE END IT 
WASN'T JUST AFRICAN AMERICAN WHO IS 
TURNED OUT IN DROVES FORTY PER CENT OF THE 
WHITE VOTE IN NORTH CAROLINA BACKED 
BARACK OBAMA THE MOMENTUM HAS 
SWUNG BACK IN HIS FAVOUR 
CONTRAST THAT WITH HILLARY CLINTON 
YES SHE DECLARED VICTORY IN 
INDIANA 
THANKS TO YOU IT'S FULL INDIANA SPEED ON TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
IT WAS HOWEVER BY THE NARROWEST 
NAR GIN AND THEN LOOK AT HER 
HUSBAND'S FACE AND LISTEN TO HER 
WORDS NARROWEST MARGIN IS THIS A 
KAND CANDIDATE WHO REALLY BELIEVES 
SHE WILL WIN 
NO MATTER WHAT 
HAPPENS L. WILL WORK FOR THE 
NOMINEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WE 
MUST WIN IN NOVEMBER 
FOR NOW THE 
TRENCH WARFARE CONTINUES BUT BARACK 
OBAMA'S LEAD LOOKS INCREASINGLY 
UNASSAILAL AND FOR CLINTON CLIN 
THE QUESTION ONCE AGAIN FOR HOW 
MUCH LONGER WELL WE COULD SOON 
HAVE AN OUTCOME ON THAT OF COURSE 
HILLARY CLINTON LATER TODAY WILL BE 
MEETING WITH THOSE SUPERDELEGATES 
THE PARTY OFFICIALS WHO COULD 
ULTIMATELY DECIDE THE OUTCOME OF 
THIS CONTEST WITHOUT THEIR SUPPORT 
IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS IT IS 
IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE HOW SHE CAN TURN 
THIS AROUND AS ONE COMMENTATOR 
SAID TONIGHT SHE IS NOW THE 
HUNTER BECOMING THE HUNTED 
AN ARMED MAN DIED LAST NIGHT AFTER 
EXCHANGING FIRE WITH POLICE IN 
CHELSEA IN WEST LONDON AN 
INVESTIGATION WILL BE CARRIED OUT 
INTO THE SHOOTING WHICH BEGAN 
DURING THE RUSH HOUR AND ENDED 
AROUND NINE HUNDRED P. M. MARK WORTHINGTON IS 
AT THE SCENE DRA AM ATTIC AND 
DANGEROUS EVENTS YESTERDAY DRARCH 
DRAMATIC 
YES AND THE 
INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN CONTINUING 
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT YOU CAN SEE 
THE POLICE TENT BEHIND ME HERE ON 
MARKHAM SQUARE YOU POSSIBLY CAN'T 
SEE IT BUT THERE ARE ADVICE I WILL 
BULLET HOLES IN THE BUILDING BEHIND 
ME THAT INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN 
GOING ON THROUGH THE NIGHT WE HAVE 
BEEN GIVEN INFORMATION BY THE 
INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS 
COMMISSION THEY HAVE TOLD US IT 
WAS A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD MAN WHO DIED AND 
THEY HAVE CONFIRMED SOME OF THE 
THINGS WE WERE HEARING ABOUT EYE 
WITNESSES ABOUT SEVERAL EGGS 
CHANGES OF FIRE BETWEEN HIM AND THE 
POLICE DEXCHANGES OF FIRE THEY 
THEN DESCRIBED HOW HE WASING 
BROUGHT OUT BY ARMED POLICE GIVEN 
FIRST AID BUT WHEN HE WAS TAKEN TO 
HOSPITAL IT WAS THERE THAT HE DIED 
BUT WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IN ANYWAY 
OFFICIALLY IS WHO HE WAS WHY HE 
WAS IN THE BUILDING AND WHY HE WAS 
SHOOTING FOR THAT ALL WE KNOW IS 
FROM A NEIGHBOUR WHO I SPOKE TO IN 
THE EARLY HOURS OF THIS MORNING 
SHE DESCRIBED TO ME HOW THE MAN WAS 
ACTUALLY ONE OF A PROFESSIONAL 
COUPLE LIVING IN THAT BUILDING AND 
THAT SHE SAW HIM AND THAT IT WAS 
HIM A RESIDENT IN THIS INCREDIBLY 
OF A FLUENT AREA OF LONDON JUST 
OFF THE KING'S ROAD WHO WAS 
INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTOUT WITH THE 
POLICE 
THERE IS DANGER THAT LAST POLICE YEAR'S FLOODS WHICH DEVASTATED 
MANY PARTS OF BRITAIN COULD BE 
REPEATED M. P.'S HAVE WARNED THERE 
ISN'T ENOUGH GOVERNMENT MONEY 
AVAILABLE AND SAY NO ONE IS QUIT 
SURE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
UNBLOCKING DRAINS MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND 
HOMES AND BUSINESSES WERE AFFECTED 
BY LAST YEAR'S FLOODS 
THE BIGGEST SHAKE UP OF THE DRIVING 
TEST IN FIFTY YEARS WILL BE PROPOSED 
BY THE GOVERNMENT TOE THE IDEA IS 
TO CUT THE GROWING NUMBER OF 
SERIOUS ACCIDENTS INVOLVING YOUNG 
DRIVERS THE TEST WILL BECOME 
TOUGHER AND MORE EXPENSIVE BUT IT 
IS THOUGHT THE MINIMUM AGE FOR 
DRIVING WILL NOT BE RAISED FROM SEVENTEEN 
TO EIGHTEEN A VOLCANO IN CHILE IS 
BLASTING LAVA AND ASH TWENTY N. I. E. L. S. INTO 
THE SKY FORCING LOCAL PEOPLE TO 
LEAVE THEIR HOMES TWENTY MILES INTO 
THE SKY IT IS BURSTING HUNDREDS OF 
MILES FROM THE CHAITEN VOLCANO 
PEOPLE IN CHILE AND ARGENTINA ARE 
BEING ADVISED TO WEAR MCS IT IS 
THE FIRST TIME THE VOLUME CANE YES 
HAS ERUPTED FOR MORE THAN NINE THOUSAND 
YEARS YOU CAN NEVER SAY NEVER 
AGAIN AGAIN WITH ONE QUARTER OF US ADMITTING 
THAT WE NEVER SAY HELLO TO THE 
PEOPLE NEXT DOOR WE ASK IF WE HAVE 
BECOME A NATION OF NASTY NEIGHBOURS 
MORE COUNCILS FROM TODAY WILL START 
USING LIE DETECTORS TO TRY TO TRAP 
BENEFIT CHEATS WHO ARE COSTING 
BRITAIN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR 
CRITICS SAY IT'LL PUT GENUINE 
CLAIMANTS OFF CLAIMING LET'S TALK 
TO THE ANTI FRAUD MINISTER 
IT IS BEING EXTENDED TO WHAT TWENTY NINE OUT 
OF FOUR HUNDRED COUNCILS 
WHEN WE GET 
THE NEXT LOT OF TESTS GOING HOW HOW MANY FRAUDSTERS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT SO 
FAR THROUGH THIS TECHNOLOGY 
SO R. 
WE HAVE HAD FOURTEEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
TESTING THIS FOR US AND THEY HAVE 
CAUGHT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FRAUDSTERS SO YOU 
ARE ENCOURAGED BY THOSE FIGURES 
YEAH THE RESULTS FROM THE PILE OOT 
WE THINK ARE VERY ENCOURAGING ONE 
COUNCIL ALONE TELLS US THEY ARE 
HAVING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR WE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HONEST 
CLAIMANTS HAVE BEEN PUT OFF 
APPLYING FOR BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY 
ARE WORRIED ABOUT BEING CAUGHT OUT 
AN HONEST CLAIMANT SHOULD HAVE NO 
FEAR BECAUSE IT WEEPBT CATCH THEM 
OUT IF THEY TELL US THE TRUTH IT 
WON'T CATCH THEM OUT IF THEY TELL 
US THE TRUTH THEIR CLAIM WILL 
PROCEED AND THEY GET THE MONEY THEY 
ARE ENTITLED TO ALSO WE TELL 
PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE STARTING THE 
TELEPHONE CALLS THAT THE TECHNOLOGY 
IS BEING APPLIED AND THEY WE SAY IF 
OFF PROBLEM AND ARE NERVOUS YOU 
DON'T HAVE TO DO IT WE WILL DO A 
FACE TO FACE INTERVIEW THERE IS NO 
REASON WHY ANYONE NERVOUS ABOUT 
BEING ON THE PHONE OR FEARFUL 
SHOULD HAVE A REASON FOR NOT 
PROCEEDING 
IT IS A COMPUTER BASED PROCEEDING SYSTEM WHICH PICKS UP ON WHAT 
HESITATIONS 
WELL THERE ARE LOTS OF HESITATIONS INDICATORS IN THE VOICE THIS 
SYSTEM PICKS UP ANY INDICATION OF 
RISK WHICH IS A SUGGESTION THAT 
SOMEONE IS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH 
WHEN THEY ANSWER A QUESTION IT 
TAKES A NORMAL READING AND WHILE 
THE INTERVIEW PROCEEDS IT CAN 
DETECT A VARIATION 
THEY FEEL 
NERVOUS THEY HESITATE AND IF 
ENGLISH ISN'T YOUR FIRST LANGUAGE 
YOU ARE NOR SUSCEPTIBLE 
NO IT'LL 
TAKE AN INDIVIDUAL READING PER 
PERSON OF WHAT IS THAT PERSON'S 
NORMAL STRESS LEVEL ONLY IF THEY 
DEPART FROM THAT LATER IN THE 
CONVERSATION WHEN WE ARE ASKING 
SPECIFIC INFORMATION RELEVANT TO 
THE BENEFIT CLAIM WILL THE SYSTEM 
TRIGGER SOMETHING IN ITSELF IT 
DOESN'T PROVE THEY ARE LYING IT 
PROVES THERE IS A RISK WHICH MEANS 
WE HAVE TO CARRY OUT MORE CHEQUES 
BEFORE WE WILL AWAR THE BENEFIT 
THE TUC SAYS SOMEONE WHO IS A PRK 
TISED LIAR MAY VERY WELL BE ABLE 
TO BEAT THE SYSTEM A PRACTISED 
LIAR LIAR BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE WHO 
ARE SCRUPULOUSLY HONEST MAY BE 
SCARED OF OF CLAIMING A BENEFIT 
THEY ARE ENTITLED TO 
I REALLY 
DON'T THINK THE LAST BIT IS TRUE 
WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE FROM THE PILOTS 
THAT THIS IS DETERRING LEGITIMATE 
CLAIMANTS INDEED THE CONTRARY 
PEOPLE ENTITLED TO THESE BENEFITS 
ARE SAYING YEAH YOU SHOULD DO 
THIS THEY WANT US TO GO AFTER THE 
CHEATS 
WHAT ABOUT THE FIRST BIT CHEATS I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY PROBLEM OF 
ANY ASPECT OF IT ANYONE WHO HAS A 
LEGITIMATE CLAIM CAN PROCEED WITH 
THIS INDAED IT HELPS US PROCESS 
THEIR CLAIM QUICKER INDEED IT 
HELPS US PROCESS THE CLAIM QUICKER 
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TELL US AN 
UNTRUTH THE EVIDENCE FROM THE 
PILOTS IS THAT IT DEPECTS IT 
SUCCESSFULLY 
WHAT WILL IT GO TO SUCCESSFULLY ALL OF THE COUNTRY 
IF WE ARE SURE 
IT IS WORKING PROPERLY AND IT IS 
VALUE FOR MONEY AND CATCHING A GOOD 
NUMBER OF CHEATS THEN THERE IS 
REALISTIC PROSPECT WE WILL ROLL IT 
OUT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING OUT TO SEE US 
SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS 
LET'S DO THAT 
MORE PRESSURE ON THE PRIME MINISTER 
THE THAMES SAYS OVER A HALF OF 
LABOUR SUPPORTERS BELIEVE GORDON 
BROWN SHOULD STAND DOWN TO MAKE WAY

AND ASH CLOUD FROM THE VOLCANO 
WHICH ERUPTED NINE THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
THE PRIME MINISTER UNDER THE KOSH

CRIPPLING TAX RISES OR FACE AN 
ELECTION ELECTION THAT WARNING

THE SUNSHINE THE SUN IS SHINING 
AND IF IT IS NOT SHINING THE 
CHANCES ARE IT WILL BE THROUGH THE 
THE MORNINGMENT SUNNY AND WARM IS 
OUR FORECAST ON THE SATELLITE 
PICTURE YOU CAN SEE THERE WAS A BIT 
OF CLOUD CROSSING SCOTLAND AND THE 
SATELLITE GOES UP TO THE PRESENT 
TIME WE HAVE GOT FOG ACROSS 
ABERDEENSHIRE INTO FIFE PERTH AND 
KINROSS BUT THAT WILL LIFT IT 
WILL BE WITH US AS WE HEAD THROUGH 
THE FIRST PART OF THE MORNING AND 
CLEARING BY MID MORNING AND THEN A 
LOT OF SUNSHINE IT WILL CLEAR 
QUICKER ACROSS THE NORTH EAST AND 
HERE TOO BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINE TO 
ENJOY FIRST THING AND THE SAME AS 
WE HEAD INTO EAST ANGLIA AND 
TOWARDS THE SOUTH COAST AND THE 
ISLE OF WIGHT 
LOVELY SUNSHINE IT DOES FEEL 
PLEASANT INDEED 
INTO THE SOUTH WEST AGAIN A LOT OF 
SUNSHINE ON OFFER THE AISLES OF OF 
SILLY UNDER LOW CLOUD THE ISLES 
OF SCILLY UNLOW CLOUD 
UNLOW CLOUD SUNSHINE WILL 
CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY IT IS AN 
IMPROVING PICTURE WHERE WE HAVE THE 
LOW CLOUD CLOSE TO THE EAST COAST 
IT WILL BE BREEZY BUT YOU DON'T 
HAVE TO MOVE TOO FAR INLAND TO SEE 
THE TEMPERATURE RISE 
THE OTHER THING THAT WILL HAPPEN 
DURING THE DAY A LITTLE BIT OF 
CLOUD WILL BUILD UP AND THERE IS 
THE RISK OF A SHOWER IN THE 
MIDLANDS OR WEST WALES 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON WE CONTINUE 
WITH THE SUNSHINE OVERNIGHT THERE 
WILL ABGOOD CLEARANCE IN THE SKY 
AND WE WILL SEE MIST AND FOG 
PATCHES FORMING 
THAT WILL CLEAR FAIRLY READILY 
TOMORROW MORNING AND IT IS ALMOST A 
REPEAT PERFORMANCE OF TODAY THERE 
WILL BE A LOT OF SUNSHINE AROUND 
BUT LATER IN THE DAY THE CLOUD 
WILL THICKEN UP IN THE SOUTH WEST 
HERE THE WIN WILL BECOME MORE GUSTY 
AND WE WILL SEE RAIN LOOK AT THE 
TEMPERATURES THEY ARE GOOD 
TIME TO TALK TO AARON THE GOING 
FOR EASYJET NOT QUITE AS EASY 
I LIKE THAT LINE BILL 
THE FIGURES COMING OFF HALF YEARLY 
FIGURES FIGURES IT IS MORE THAN DOUBLE WHAT IT WAS 
THIS TIME LAST YEAR THE TOTAL 
REVENUE UP TWENTY FOUR PER CENT COMING IN AT OVER 
EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY MILLION PASSENGER NUMBERS UP 
FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS 
OVER THE PAST YEAR THOSE NUMBERS 
ARE UP MORE THAN FORTY MILLION 
PASSENGERS THROUGH WITH EASYJET IT 
IS THE FIRST TIME THEY BROKE THAT 
FORTY MILLION MARK ONE WOULD WONDER 
WHY THEY SAW A PROFIT LOSS 
THE MAIN CULPRIT COMING DOWN TO THE 
HIGH OIL PRICES AT THE MOMENTMENT 
WE WILL BE TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW 
MUCH OF AN IMPACT THIS IS HAVING ON 
EASYJET AS WELL AS THE CONSUMER 
SLOWDOWN WE WILL BE TALKING TO THE 
C. E. O. OF EASYJET IF YOU HAVE ANY 
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YOU WANT ME 
TO PASS ON TO THE CHEEK DROP ME AN 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE DROP ME AN E. 
MAIL MAIL THE OTHER BIG STORY CONSUMER 
CONFIDENCE IT HIT AN ALL TIME LOW 
IT IS ACCORDING TO FIGURES OUT FROM 
THE NATIONWIDE THE BUILDING 
SOCIETY'S CONSUMER CONFIDENCE INDEX 
AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE IT WAS 
LAUNCH INDEED 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR IT IS TWENTY TWO PER CENT 
BELOW THIS SAME TIME LAST YEAR AND 
THIRTY NINE PER CENT OF PEOPLE SURVEYED SAY THEY 
THINK THE ECONOMY IS IN BAD SHAPE 
AND ALMOST HALF THINK IT WILL GET 
WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER 
THE THE F. T. S. E. WAS FLAT YESTERDAY 
A BREAKFAST SURVEY FOUND THAT HALF 
OF US SPEAK TO JUST SIX PEOPLE OR 
FEWER IN OUR STREET EACH WEEK MANY 
OF US HARDLY KNOW OUR NEIGHBOURS 
COMMUNITY WORKERS SAY OUR GROWING 
LACK OF NEIGHBOURLINESS IS HAVING A 
BAD IMPACT ON BRITISH STREET LIFE 
DAVID SILLITO HAS BEEN FOLLOWING A 
GOOD NEIGHBOUR IN SEARCH OF GOOD 
FRIENDS FRIENDS DID YOU FIND ANY 
I HAVE BEEN TO 
PETERBOROUGH WE CHOSE IT AT RANDOM 
WE WANTED AN AVERAGE NEIGHBOURHOOD 
AND TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT 
LOOKING AT THAT FOOTAGE FROM STREET 
LIFE IT IS THE THING THAT PEOPLE 
ALWAYS LOOK AT WHEN THEY SEE 
ARCHIVE FOOTAGE HOW MANY PEOPLE 
THERE ARE ON THE STREET CHILDREN 
ADULTS FRONT GARDENS TALKING TO 
ONE ANOTHER AND AND HOW QUIET IT IS 
NOW SURELY EVERYONE WANTS TO LIVE 
IN A QUIET STREET BUT I MET A 
COUPLE OF OF PEOPLE WHO THINK IT 
MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD THING 
WE ARE IN HAMPTON IN PETERBOROUGH 
AND 
JEAN IS TAKING MEGAN OUT FOR WALK WALK JEAN IS VERY FRIENDLY 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
YOU MISSED ONE 
AND GETTING TO KNOW THE NEIGHBOURS 
IS IMPORTANT TO HER 
BUT AROUND HERE IT HAS BEEN HARD 
HI YA 
IF YOU CAN'T GET IN TOUCH WITH 
PEOPLE IF YOU CAN'T GET BEYOND THE 
BRICK WALL YOU CAN'T HELP ANYBODY 
IT IS LIKE ME I AM FRIENDLY AND I 
DO SAY HELLO ALWAYS SAY HI YA 
AND IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY WHAT DO 
YOU WANT I DON'T KNOW YOU HOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAS SHE BEEN ABLE TO 
SAY HELLO TO IN HER STREET IN THE 
LAST WEEK 
FOUR FOUR FOUR IN THE PAST WEEK 
GOOD FOR BAD 
SAD VERY SAD 
I I CARRIED ON WALKING AND WALK AND 
WALKING EVENTUALLY I PASS ADD 
PERSON PERSON IT IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN 
AROUND HERE 
IS IT THOUGHT THERE 
MIGHT BE ONE PERSON TO SAY HELLO TO 
AS YOU WALK PAST 
NO NO EVERYBODY 
IS SORT OF AWAY DOING THEIR OWN 
LITTLE BUSINESS AREN'T THEY 
THAT'S IT WE HAVE WALKED AROUND 
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND I BUMPED INTO 
ONE PERSON 
AND IT WASN'T JUST ME L. MANAGE 
TODAY FIN A FEW PEOPLE TO HAVE A 
CHAT TO 
IN THE LAST WEEK HOW MANY OF YOUR 
NEIGHBOURS HAVE YOU SAID HELLO TO 
IN THE STREETS 
ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE OR TWO 
PROBABLY TWO I THINK 
NO ONE 
SO PEOPLE KEEP THEMSELVES TO 
THEMSELVES SO WHAT WELL IT IS 
PROBLEM FOR JOAN TIBS SHE IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR NEIGHBOURHOOD 
RELATIONS IN THE TOWN'S PUBLIC 
HOUSING HOUSING I THINK PEOPLE HAVE JUST LOST THE 
ABILITY TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND 
THEY HAVE LOST THAT FEELING OF 
SAYING GOOD MORNING 
THEY HAVE TO CALL YOU IN TO SORT 
THEIR PROBLEMS OUT 
YES AND WE SAY 
TO PEOPLE HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO YOUR 
NEIGHBOUR ABOUT PARKING OR THE 
OVERFLOWING BIN WELL NO WE 
HAVEN'T WHY NOT WE ARE TRYING 
TO GET PEOPLE TO START 
COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER 
IT REACHED SUCH POINT SHE NOW 
GETS TENANTS TO SIGN THIS 
YOU HAVE TO GET THEM TO SIGN 
PIECE OF PAPER TO GET THEM TO TALK 
TO ONE ANOTHER 
IN SOME CASES YES 
FOR JEAN THE FRIENDLY HELLO IS AN 
ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE HAPPY LIFE 
BUT THIS IS MODERN BRITAIN PLACE 
OF CARS AND CLOSED DOORS SOCIETY 
IN WHICH HALF OF US DON'T MANAGE AT 
LEAST ONE FRIENDLY GREETING DAY WITH NEIGHBOUR ON OUR OWN STREET 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MAIN 
PROBLEM IN THOSE HOUSES THERE WAS 
PLENTY OF ROOM FOR PEOPLE TO 
SOCIALISE AND CHAT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WHEN YOU LOOK THE CAR PARKING IS AT 
THE BACK IN COURTYARDS PEOPLE GET 
IN THEIR CARS AND GO AND DO WHAT 
THEY HAVE TO DO AND NEVER WALK DOWN 
THEIR OWN STREET WALK DOWN MANY 
MANY STREETS IN LONDON AND MANY 
CITIES YOU WILL FIND ALL THE FRONT 
GARDENS HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO 
PARKING PEOPLE GET INTO THEIR CARS 
AND OUT AGAINMENT SO EVERYTHING 
THAT TOOK YOU DOWN THE STREET WELL 
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN SHIFT WORK BUSY 
LIVES THERE IS LOADS AND LOADS OF 
REASONS FOR IT BUT THERE ARE MANY 
PEOPLE WHO ARE RELYAN ON THEIR 
SOCIAL NETWORKS IN THE STREETS WHO 
KIND OF FEEL ABANDONED BY ALL OF IT 
LOTS OF US HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS AND 
BUSY LIVES BUT THERE ARE MANY 
PEOPLE WHEN YOU START KNOCKING ON 
SOME DOORS SAYING I WISH IT WAS 
MORE LIKE IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO 
LOTS OF SUGGESTIONS COMING IN 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE SUGGESTING STREET 
PARTIES A GOOD IDEA OF GETTING 
PEOPLE INVOLVED 
BRISTOL IS THE HOME OF STREET 
PARTIES PARTIES IS IT 
IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR STREET 
PARTIES THEY ARE THE PEOPLE FOR IT 
AND THEY HAVE HAD REAL SUCCESS WITH 
THAT THAT OWNING A DOG 
BRIAN SAYS THAT'S THE MOST POSITIVE 
THING TO DO NINETY PER CENT OF DOG WALKERS

GOOD MORNING 
THERE IS A RUE LOOMING OVER THE 
CLASSIFICATION OF CANNABIS IT IS 
EXPECTED THE HOME SECRETARY WILL 
ANNOUNCE TODAY THAT THE DRUG SHOULD 
BE UPGRADED FROM CLS C. WHERE 
POSSESSION IS TREATED LARGELY AS A 
NON ARRESTABLE OFFENCE TO CLASS B. 
THE ANNOUNCEMENT COMES ON THE VERY 
DAY THAT AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW SAYS 
IT SHOULDN'T CHANGE 
MOVING IT BACK 
TO CLASS B. WILL JUST DRIVE IT 
FURTHER UNDERGROUND WHICH MEANS 
LESS CONTROL AND I DON'T THINK 
IT'LL ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS THE 
ONLY THING IT'LL DO IS PER CENT CUTE MYSELF 
AND MILE YONS OF PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO 
BASICALLY USE CANNABIS IN THE 
PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN HOME WITHOUT 
HURTING ANYONE 
INTERNATIONAL AID 
AGENCIES ARE WAITING FOR BURMA'S 
MILITARY TO OPEN THIER BORDERS THE

WOULD WANT TO WORK WE HAVE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT WORKING IN FIVE AREAS

INDEPENDENT ANIA SHE WILL MEET SO 
CALLED SUPERBELL FATES OF THE PARTY

NEEDS FOR HER CAMPAIGN TO CONTINUE 
THERE IS A DANGER THAT LAST YEAR'S 
FLOODS WHICH DEVASTATED MANY PARTS 
OF BRITAIN COULD BE REPEATED M. P.'S 
ARE WARNED THERE ISN'T ENOUGH 
GOVERNMENT MONEY AVAILABLE AND SAYS 
NO ONE IS SURE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR UNBLOCKING DRAINS MORE THAN 
FIFTY THOUSAND HOMES AND BUSINESSES WERE

MONTHS BUT CRITICS ARE CONCERNED 
THAT INNOCENT CLAIM IT'S A WILL BE 
PUT OFF CLAIMING FOR MONEY THEY ARE 
NTIETLED TO FOR FEAR OF BEING 
LABELLED A FRAUDSTER 
THE BIGGEST SHAKE UP IN THE DRIVING 
TEST FOR FIFTY YEARS WILL BE PROPOSED 
BY THE GOVERNMENT THE IDEA IS TO 
CUT THE NUMBER OF SERIOUS ACCIDENTS 
INVOLVING YOUNG DRIVERS THE TEST 
WILL BECOME TOUGH ENAND MORE 
EXPENSIVE IT IS THOUGHT THE 
MINIMUM AGE OF DRIVING FOR NOT BE 
RAISED FROM SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN 
A VOLCANO IN CHILE IS BLASTING LAVA 
AND ASH FORTY MILES INTO THE SKY 
THE LAVA IS STRETCHING HUNDREDS OF 
MILES FROM THE CHAITEN VOLCANO 
PEOPLE IN ARGENTINA AND CHILE ARE 
BEING WARNED TO WEAR MASKS 
THOSE ARE THE MAIN STORIES COMING 
UP B. E. F. O. R. E. ZERO ZERO A M. A U. TURN ON THE

PLANS FOR A SHAKE UP OF DRIVER 
TRAINING WHICH COULD MEAN THE END 
OF TESTING MANOEUVRES 
DRIVING TESTS FIRST TIME PASS 
FIRST TIME PASS IF AT FIRST YOU 
DON'T SUCCEED 
TRY TRY AGAIN L. I JUST REMEMBER MY LITTLEM INI YOU 
COULD SEE RIGHT THROUGH TO THE 
FLOOR OF THE ROAD MORNING THE 
RANGERS' CHAIRMAN SIR DAVID MURRAY 
CLAIMS SCOTTISH FOOTBALL IS WILL 
HAVEING STOCK AFTER HE FAILED TO 
PERSUADE THE SCOTTISH PREMIER 
LEAGUE TO EXTEND THE DOMESTIC

FIVE LEAGUE GAMES AND TWO CUP 
FINALS IN ONE DAYS THEY TAKE ON 
MOTHERWELL TONIGHT THE SCOTTISH 
FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION MET WITH THE 
S. P. L. YET BUT NEITHER COULD FIND A 
SOLUTION 
I THINK IT IS DOING SOLUTION DAMAGE THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT 
THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST SAYING THERE 
IS NO SUPPORT FOR A TEAM IN THE 
EUROPEAN FINAL AND THAT'S GOING 
ACROSS EUROPE THE WORLD AT THE 
MOMENT AND THERE WILL BE A CERTAIN 
AMOUNT OF DAMAGE TO THE REPUTATION 
OF THE GAME BECAUSE OF THAT L. HAVE 
NO DOUBT 
NOW IS BIG PHIL ON HIS 
WAY TO MANCHESTER CITY LUIS FELIPE 
SCOLARI'S AT SAYS CITY HAVE MADE AN 
INQUIRY ABOUT THE BRAZILIAN TAKING 
OVER FROM SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON 
SCOLARI'S SPOKESMAN SAID 
NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNLIKELY TO BEGIN 
BEFORE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BUT THE PARTIES COULD 
ME ERIKSSON RETAINS THE BACKING OF 
FANS BUT CITY CHAIRMAN THAKSIN 
SHINAWTRA IS FRUSTRATED WITH HIS 
SIDE'S SLUMP AFTER A STRONG START 
TO THE SEASON 
THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION SAY THE 
ENGLAND MANAGER FABIO CAPELLO MUST 
REACH THE SEMI FINALS OF THE TWO THOUSAND TEN 
WORLD CUP OR EURO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OR COULD 
FACE THE TAST SACK CAPELLO IS THE 
KEY MAN AS THE F. A. UNVEILED THEIR 
VISION FOR THE FUTURE YESTERDAY 
THEY PLAN TO APPROVE AN 
INTERNATIONAL PERFORMANCE DIRECTOR

INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALL CENTRE IN 
BURTON IT SHOULD BE UP AND RUNNING 
BY TWO THOUSAND TEN

TALENT L. AM CONFIDENT I HAVE A 
GREAT TEAM AND CAN DO VERY WELL

B. B. C. HE BELIEVES ONLY URGENT ACTION 
CAN RESCUE ATHLETES DRUG TARNISHED 
REPUTATION HE HAD HARSH WORDS FOR 
BRITAIN'S HIGH PROFILE OFFENDER 
DWAIN CHAMBERS

JOIN GOVERNMENT THE PUBLIC AS WELL 
AS THE ATHLETES JOIN TOGETHER AND 
DO IT WHEN I COMPETED I SPOKE OUT 
VEHEMENTLY AGAINST DRUGS AND 
EVERYBODY CALLED ME A TATTLE TALE 
THE REALITY IS WHAT DUE WANT L. 
THINK WE OUGHT TO COME TOGETHER 
LIKE THEY DID WITH MARION JONES 
THEY USED THE GOVERNMENT TO DO IT 
AND FIND OUT L. WOULD CHANGE LAWS 
BECAUSE IF YOU TEST POSITIVE WHY 
CAN'T IT BE ILL LILLE SO WE HAVE TO 
GET YOU UNDER ILL LILLE 
DWAIN CHAMBERS TOLD US YOU HAVE TO 
CHEAT TO WIN 
DWAIN CHAMBERS DIDN'T 
HAVE TALENT HE HAD TO TAKE DRUGS 
AND CHEAT I'M TIRED OF THE PEOPLE 
WHO DON'T HAVE TALENT AND TRY TO 
BLAME EVERYBODY THE REAL IS MOST 
ATHLETES ARE CLEAN AND DO IT RIGHT 
AND GOOD ATHLETES TAKE DRUGS 
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE TALENT 
TAKE DRUGS

DRAGONS HAVE BEATEN OSPREYS BY EIGHTEEN 
TEN AND ARE NOW SEVENTH IN THE TABLE 
I WILL BE BACK LATER 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
APPROACHING SEVEN THIRTY FOUR OH SEVEN A M. 
A MAJOR SWHAIK UP OF THE DRIVING 
TEST A MAJOR SHAKE UP OF THE 
DRIVING TEST AND NEW RULES FOR 
YOUNG DRIVERS WILL BE ANNOUNCED 
TODAY ACCORDING TO THE SOCIETY FOR 
THE PREVENTION OF ACCIDENTS UNDER 
THREE THOUSAND UNDER TWENTY FIVES ARE KILLED EVERY 
YEAR YEAR THE GOVERNMENT LOOK AT BANNING 
DRIVERS FROM UNDER TWENTY FROM BEING ON 
THE ROADS AT THE NIGHTS OR CARRYING 
FELLOW TENAGE PASSENGERS AND CHANGE 
THE TEST 
MOTORING EXPERT QUENTIN WILLSON IS 
HERE ALONG WITH LISA DORN A 
DIRECTOR OF A LEADING DRIVING 
SCHOOL SCHOOL THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH LISA 
HAVE DEVELOPED A GCSE LEVEL 
QUALIFICATION FOR DRIVING WHAT IS 
IT ABOUT 
WELL THE AIM OF THE GCSE 
EQUIVALENT IS TO TAKE ON BOARD THE 
PHYSICAL SKILLS OF LEARNING TO 
DRIVE BUT COVER ALL THE OTHER RISKS 
ASSOCIATED WITH DRIVING TO DO WITH 
DRIVING AT NIGHT DRIVING IN BAD 
WEATHER THE ATTITUDES THAT PEOPLE 
HAVE AND SOME OF THE VERY IMPORTANT 
DECISION MAKING SKILLS THAT PEOPLE 
NEED 
DO YOU THINK THIS IS NEED SOMETHING THAT ALL LEARNER DRIVERS 
SHOULD HAVE TO PASS 
IT IS WELL 
OVER DUE 
THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING 
AT MAKING IT TOUGH TORE PASS THEIR 
DRIVING TEST TAKE THEIR DRIVING 
TEST AND MORE EXPENSIVE IS THERE A 
DANGER THAT YOUNG PEOPLE MIGHT BE 
PUT OFF TAKING TESTS COULD LEAD TO 
MORE DANGEROUS DRIVING OR ARE THESE 
ESSENTIAL MEASURES IN ORDER TO 
IMPROVE THE SAFETY 
THEY ARE 
COMPLETELY ESSENTIAL A LONG OVER 
DUE IT IS BONKERS THAT KIDS ARE 
ALLOWED TO GOUT IN CARS AND NOT 
HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE OF DRIVING AT 
NIGHT NOT HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE AT 
DRIVING IN BAD WEATHER IN RAIN 
AND NOT HAVE ANY MANDATORY TUITION 
TO DRIVE ON A MOTORWAY IT IS 
RECKLESS IT IS WHY TWO HUNDRED KIDS ARE 
KILLED EVERY YEAR THIS AS FAR AS 
I'M CONCERNSIDE GREAT THERE MUST 
NOT BE A FINANCIAL BARRIER TO ENTRY 
WE SHOULD INTRODUCE THE DRIVING 
TEST THEME WE SHOULD GIVE PEOPLE 
EVERY INCENTIVE YOUR GCSE IS 
FANTASTIC IT IS POSSIBLY ONE THING 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL DO TO 
ACTUALLY IMPROVE ROAD SAFETY 
TEENAGE DRIVERS JUST DON'T TAKE IN 
INFORMATION AT THE WHEEL IN THE 
SAME WAY THAT OLDER DRIVERS DO 
ABSOLUTELY NOT AND OF COURSE WHEN 
THEY PASS THEIR DRIVING TEST THEY 
THINK THAT'S IT I'M XETEPT I KNOW 
WHAT I'M DOING BUT ACTUALLY THEY 
DON'T AND THEY TAKE ON THE 
BEHAVIOURS OF THE PEOPLE THEY LEARN 
ABOUT DRIVING FROM SUCH AS THEIR 
PARENTS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST ROLE 
MODELS 
AND THEIR VISION 
IT IS MODELS DIFFERENT THEY TEND TO JUST LOOK A 
FEW FEET AHEAD OF THEMSELVES 
RATHER THAN SCAN ALL THE ROADWAY 
THEY CANNOT ANTICIPATE WHAT IS 
COMING UP IN SWEDEN YOU HAVE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
MANDATORY HOURS OF DRIVING TUITION 
WE DON'T HAVE THAT 
IT WOULD MAKE 
IT REALLY EXPENSIVE 
YOU CANNOT DO 
THE AFFORDABILITY ARGUMENT AGAINST 
LOSING TWO HUNDRED LIVES A YEAR THESE 
LIVES NEED TO BE SAVED 
IT IS 
STRANGE WHEN WE TOOK OUR DRIVE 
TEST THERE WASN'T NEARLY THIS 
AMOUNT OF DETENTION TO DETAIL L. 
WAS REMEMBER SITTING IN THE SEAT 
AND YOU WERE ASKED A FEW CURSEY 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE HIGHWAY CODE 
IT HAS GOT TOUGHER BUT IS TO MAKING 
AN IMPACT 
THE ROADS HAVE GOT 
IMPOSSIBLY MORE DIFFICULT NOW YOU YOU KNOW THE RESEARCH WHY HAS IT NOT 
MADE A DIFFERENCE 
WHAT SEEMS TO BE 
HAPPENING IS PEOPLE ARE JUST NOT 
KNOWLEDGABLE ABOUT THE RISKS IT 
SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE IT IS 
CONCERNED WITH ATTITUDES PEOPLE'S 
ATTITUDE IT DRIVING SEEMS TO BE 
HAVING THE BIGGEST IMPACT THERE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS FROM 
VIEWERS THIS MORNING IAN SAYS 
THEY SHOULD MAKE ALL NEW DRIVERS 
DISPLAY GREEN L. PLATES FOR THE 
FIRST YEAR AFTER PASSING THE TEST 
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE SAYING INSURANCE 
COMPANIES SHOULD NOT INSURE YOUNG 
DRIVERS ON ENGINES THAT ARE TOO BIG 
AGREED 
ONE POINT THREE SHOULD BE THE LIMIT AND AGREED COLIN SAYS ALL DRAIVERS SHOULD BE 
MADE TO SIT A TEST EVERY FIVE YEARS 
SNOOSM RE TEST SOMETHING GOOD IT 
IS NOT JUST YOUNG PEOPLE WE HAVE A 
NATIONAL DRIVING SKILLS CRISIS GO 
OUT ON THE ROADS AND YOU SEE IT IT 
IS LIKE A VIDEO GAME 
WE REALLY 
NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO BE AS HARD 
AS THEY CAN L. THINK SOME OF THE 
STUFF THAT WILL COME OUT THIS 
MORNING IS NOT HARD ENOUGH 
A DRIVE 
TEST EVERY FIVE YEARS FOR YOU I I CERTAINLY THINK THAT BECAUSE OF THE 
KIND OF DRIFT AWAY FROM APPROPRIATE 
WAYS OF RESPONDING IN TRAFFIC 
PEOPLE START GETTING FRUSTRATED 
THEY START GETTING ANNOYED THEY 
START THINKING ABOUT BEING ON TIME 
RATHER THAN BEING CAREFUL YOU KNOW 
THERE SHOULD BE REGULAR CHECKS 
REFRESHER TRAINING YES 
DOBB FAIR 
SOME YOUNGER DRIVERS ARE WRITING IN 
SAYING I DON'T AGREE WITH BANNING 
DRIVERS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY I'M NINETEEN 
BEEN DRIVING NEARLY TWO YEARS 
HASN'T HAD AN ACCIDENT IT SHOULD 
BE DOWN TO THE INDIVIDUAL TO ACT 
RESPONSIBLY 
SHE HAS A POINT SHE RESPONSIBLY IS GAIRL IT IS THE TESTOSTERONE 
FUELLED NINETEEN TO TWENTY YEAR OLD MALE YOU 
HAVE TO BE ON THEIR SIDE RESEARCH 
SAYS THEY ALL WANT TO IMPROVE THEIR 
DRIVING SKILLS WITH YOU THEY ARE 
INEXPERIENCED AVON WE ARE NOT 
HELPING THEM I'M ON THEIR SIDE L. 
JUST DON'T WANT THEM TO DIE I I THINK IT IS UNLIKELY THERE WILL BE 
A CURFEW ON NIGHT TIME DRIVING L. 
THINK IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO 
ENFORCE 
INSURANCE COMPANIES DO A ENFORCE VOLUNTARY THING WHERE THEY GIVE YOU 
A DISCOUNT IF YOU DON'T DRIVE AT 
NIGHT LET'S PUT IT IN PLACE AND 
MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE 
I'M SURE 
YOU HAVE MORE VIEWS ON THIS KEEP 
THEM COMING IN 
GOVERNMENT MINISTERS ARE EXPECTED 
TO REJECT THEIR OWN EXPERTS ADVICE 
ADVICE BY RECLASSIFYING CANNABIS AS 
A MORE DANGEROUS DRUG 
AID AGENCIES APPEAL TO BURMA TO 
OPEN ITS BORDERS SO THEY CAN HELP 
THE SURVIVORS OF THE PSYCHE LOAN 
COUNCIL SCICK LOAN 
COUNCILS GET THE GREEN LIGHT TO USE 
LIE DETEBORS 
NOW DETECTORS 
NOW THE WEATHER 
IS IT GOING TO BE HOT AND SUNNY 
IT ISMENT WE ARE GOING TO BE 
LOOKING AT ANOTHER CRACKING DAY 
WEATHER WISE 
TODAY WE COULD SEE TEMP SIMILAR 
TEMPERATURES TO YESTERDAY 
WHAT WE HAVE IS SOME CLOUD WHICH 
HAS BEEN MOVING NORTH ACROSS 
SCOTLAND BUT CURRENTLY WE HAVE FOG 
AND SOME LOW CLOUD ACROSS 
ABERDEENSHIRE INTO FIFE NOR THUMB 
BETTER LAND AND THE VALE NOR 
THUMB BETTER LAND AND THE VALE OF 
YORK YORK BY NINE A M. IT SHOULD CLEAR FROM THE 
NORTH EAST AND WE ARE INTO LOVELY 
BLUE SKIES AND AS WE HEAD THROUGH 
EAST ANGINGLY ANGLIA AND IN THROUGH 
KENT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL START IN 
THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WE'RE 
LOOKING AT A GORGEOUS START TO THE 
DAY DAY FOR WALES SOME SUNSHINE ON OFFER 
AND NOT COLD NEITHER WILL IT BE IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND BELFAST TWELVE 
CELSIUS AND BY NINE A M. WE WILL SEE THE 
CLOUD THIN AND WE WILL HAVE 
SUNSHINE THE SUNSHINE IS REALLY 
GOING TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY 
DOWN THE EAST COAST YOU WILL 
NOTICE A BREEZE BUT YOU WON'T HAVE 
TO MOVE FAR INLAND WHEN THE 
TEMPERATURES RISE 
IT WILL BE COOLER DUE TO THE BREEZE 
ANY SHOWERS WILL DIE AWAY THROUGH 
THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT AGAIN 
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF CLEAR SKIES 
AND SOME COASTAL FOG LAPPING ON TO 
THE SHORES OF EASTERN SCOTLAND AND 
THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND BUT NOT 
A COLD NIGHT 
TOMORROW WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER 
GLORIOUS DAY WITH A LOT OF SUNSHINE 
THE OTHER THING YOU WILL NOTICE IS 
THE CLOUD WILL THICKEN LATER IN THE 
DAY THE WINDS WILL BECOME MORE 
GUSTY AND WE WILL HAVE RAIN 
TEMPERATURES SIMILAR TO TODAY WAY 
ABOVE AVERAGE TWENTY THREE CELSIUS OR TWENTY FOUR 
CELSIUS CELSIUS THE POLLEN INDEX IS HIGH AT THE 
MOMENT ESPECIALLY TREE POLLEN 
SHALL WE CROSS TO THE STOCK 
EXCHANGE EXCHANGE LET'S TALK EASYJET THE FIGURES ARE 
ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES AGO FOR EASYJET 
HALF YEAR FIGURES 
EASYJET SAW A LOSS IN PROFITS IT 
CAME IN AT FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION BUT THEY 
SAW TOTAL REVENUE WAS UP TWENTY FOUR PER CENT OVER 
THE PAST SIX MONTHS COMING IN AT 
OVER EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY MILLION AND PASSENGER 
NUMBERS ARE UP ALMOST NINETEEN MILLION 
PEOPLE THROUGH WITH EASYJET OVER 
THE PAST SIX MONTHS BUT THE BIG 
CULPRIT FOR LOSS IN PROFIT COMES 
DOWN TO THE HIGH OIL PRICES 
REMEMBERING I JUST TOUCHED ON IT 
EARLIER YESTERDAY ANOTHER RECORD 
ABOVE ABOVE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO DOLLARS FOR BARREL OF 
OIL IT IS TOUGH TIMES NOT ONLY 
TOUGH TIMES FOR EASYJET THE HOLE 
INDUSTRY IS FEELING THIS NO FEWER 
THAN ELEVEN AIRLINES AROUND THE 
WORLD HAVE CLOSED DOWN THIS YEAR SO 
SOME BIG PROBLEMS THERE AND 
ANALYSTS SAY WITH OIL TO REMAIN 
HIGH THE PAIN UNFORTUNATELY THERE 
WILL BE MORE OF IT LET'S FIND OUT 
HOW TESTING THESE TIMES ARE ANDY 
HARRISON IS THE C. E. O. OF EASYJET 
I GUESS LET'S START WITH THAT HOW 
TESTING IS IT AT THE MOMENT AND IS 
THE LOW COST MODEL AT RISK IF WE 
SEE THE OIL PRICES REMAIN HIGH 
HIGH OIL PRICES ARE A CHALLENGE IF 
THEY ARE SUSTAIN BUT EASYJET IS 
FANTASTIC BUSINESS AND THE BASIS OF 
ITS SUCCESS THE REASON WHY WE HAVE 
LOW LOW FARES IS THAT WE ARE HIGHLY 
EFFICIENT AND WE FLY NEW AIRCRAFT 
WE HAVE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY AIRCRAFT WITH AN 
AVERAGE AGE OF JUST THREE YEARS 
WHICH MEANS THEY ARE FUEL EFFICIENT 
AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT EASYJET WILL 
WIN THROUGH BECAUSE IT IS EFFICIENT 
AND BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT NEW 
AIRCRAFT AIRCRAFT IT IS A GREAT AIRLINE YOU FLY NEW 
NEW PLANES BUT WE CAN'T ESCAPE THE 
PROBLEM OF THE HIGH OIL PRICES HOW 
DO YOU COMBAT THAT YOU DON'T ADD A 
FUEL SURCHARGE WHAT LEVEL DOES OIL 
HAVE TO GO TO WHEN WE WILL SEE 
EASYJET ADDING A FUEL SURCHARGE WE WE WON'T ADD A FUEL SURCHARGE IF HIGH 
OIL PRICES ARE SUSTAINED WE WILL 
SEE A LOT OF THE WEAKER AIRLINES 
DISAPPEAR FOR EXAMPLE A QUARTER 
OF THE SHORT HAUL AIRCRAFT IN 
EUROPE ARE OVER FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AND 
THEY BURN AT LEAST TWENTY PER CENT MORE FUEL 
THAN OUR AIRCRAFT IT WILL BE THE 
WEAKER AIRLINES WITH THE OLD 
AIRCRAFT WHO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO 
STAY IN BUSINESS M. 
HOW WILL YOU COMBAT THE HIGHER FUEL 
COSTS WILL WE SEE AIR FARES 
INCREASE WITH EASYJET IF OIL 
PRICES ARE SUSTAIN AIR FARES WILL 
HAVE TO RISE BUT AT WHAT LEVEL 
DOES OIL HAVE TO GO BEFORE WE SEE 
AN INCREASE IN EASYJET'S FARES WE WE ARE NOT AN MONOPOLY B. A. A. AIRPORT WE 
OPERATE IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS 
EITHER WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS STRONG 
DEMAND WILL SLOWLY INCREASE FARES 
OR MORE LIKELY THE WEAK AIRLINES 
WILL DISAPPEAR AND THERE WILL BE A 
REDUCTION IN SUPPLY AND AN INCREASE 
IN FARES 
BRIEFLY WE ARE SEEING A CONSUMER 
INTRO DOWN ACROSS MOST SECTORS ARE 
YOU SEEING SLOWDOWN 
WE ARE NOT 
NO REDUCTION IN DISCRETIONARY AIR 
TRAVEL OUR LOAD FACTORS WERE THE 
SAME AS LAST YEAR AND OUR FORWARD 
BOOKINGS ARE AHEAD OF THIS TIME 
LAST YEAR 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US

BE COMING BACK WITH MORE BUSINESS

GARDEN SECURE THERE IS A ROW 
LOOMING OVER THE CLASSIFICATION OF 
CANNABIS IT IS EXPECTED THE HOME 
SECRETARY WILL ANNOUNCE TODAY THE 
DRUG SHOULD BE UP GRADED FROM CLASS 
CFPLTD WHERE POSSESSION IS TREATED 
AS A NON ARRESTABLE OFFENCE TO 
CLASS B. GORDON BROWN WANTS TO SEND 
A STRONG MESSAGE THAT THE USE OF 
CANNABIS IS UNACCEPTABLE THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT COMES ON THE DAY THAT 
AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW SAYS IT 
SHOULD NOT CHANGE CANNABIS ARE UNDER THE 
THE LAWS ON CANNABIS ARE UNDER THE MICROSPOCE AT THE FORENSIC SCIENCE 
LABORATORY IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE THEY 
FIND CANNABIS IS MORE POWERFUL THAN 
BEFORE THE MORE STRONGER VARIETY 
STUNK IS MORE WIDESPREAD 
CANNABIS CULTIVATERS HAVE DEVELOPED 
HIGHER STRENGTH STRAINS OF CANNABIS 
THAT IS TYPICALLY GROWN INDOORS IN 
ARTIFICIAL CONDITIONS IT IS THESE 
HIGHER STRENGTH STRAINS THAT ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASE IN THE 
DRUG STRENGTH 
STRONGER CANNABIS 
AND THE RISK OF DEVELOPING MENTAL 
ILLNESS LED SOME OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S DRUGS ADVISERS TO CALL 
FOR CANNABIS TO BE RESTORED TO 
CLASS B. 
BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS LIKELY TO 
DISREGARD THE PANEL'S ADVICE IF IF THEY GO AGAINST THE ADVICE OF THEIR 
ADVICERY BODY THAT WOULD BE A 
MISTAKE IT COULD SEND OUT A 
MESSAGE THAT IT CAN BE DRIVEN BY 
POLITICAL HEADLINES AND SOME 
EXAGGERATED MEDIA COVERAGE MANY MANY CANNABIS USERS HAVE BEEN SMOKING 
THE DRUG WITHOUT ILL EFFECTS FOR 
YEARS THE COUNCIL SAYS YOUNG 
PEOPLE MUST BE MADE AWARE OF THE 
DANGERS INTERNATIONAL AID AGENCIES 
ARE WAITING FOR BURMA'S MILITARY 
RULERS TO OPEN THEIR BORDERS THE 
CYCLONE HAS KILLED MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE THERE FORTY THOUSAND ARE STILL 
MISSING WINDS OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILES PER 
HOUR CAUSED THE DEVASTATION 
LEAVING ONE MILLION WITHOUT SHELTER 
AND DESPERATELY IN NEED FOR FOOD 
AND WATER OUR CORRESPONDENT HAS 
MANAGED TO GET INTO THE SOUTH OF 
THE COUNTRY AND SENT ISLE THIS 
REPORT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE IN BURMA ARE ENDURING THEIR 
FIFTH DAY CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE 
WORLD STRANDED ACROSS THE 
IRRAWADDY DELTA WAITING FOR RELIEF 
INTERNATIONAL AID HAS BEEN 
TRICKLING INTO THE COUNTRY BUT 
NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE 
KNOWN TO BE DEAD MANY MORE ARE 
MISSINGMENT PERHAPS ONE MILLION 
WITHOUT FOOD AND SHELTER AND THE 
TRUE SCALE OF THIS DISASTER IS YET 
TO EMERGE MANY ROADS ARE STILL 
BLOCKED BY FALLEN TREES AND DEBRIS 
THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE 
RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THIS 
CATASTROPHE IT IS THE RELUCTANCE 
TO OPEN THE DOOR FULLY TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL AID TEAMS WAITING 
OUTSIDE 
WE HAVE MET WITH THE OUTSIDE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL WELFARE ONE OF 
THE THINGS THEY WOULD LIKE US TO DO 
IS PROVIDE A CLEAR IDEA OF HOW WE 
WANT TO WORK WE HAVE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT WORKING IN FIVE AREAS IN THE 
WORST AFFECTED REGION OF YANGON 
WHICH IS THIS DELTA REGION ENTIRE 
VILLAGES AND TOWNS WERE WIPED OUT 
BY THE TIDAL SURGE CAUSED BY THE 
CYCLONE THE FEAR IS THAT THE LONG 
TER AID GROUPS ARE DELAYED THE 
WORSE THE RISK OF DISEASE WILL TAKE 
HOLD IN A COUNTRY WITH AN ALREADY 
FRAGILE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
A FEW MONTHS AGO WE TOLD YOU THAT 
LIE DETECTORS ARE BEING TRIED OUT 
TO TRAP BENEFIT CHEAT WHO COST THE 
COUNTRY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR AFTER 
SUCCESSFUL TRAILS THE EQUIPMENT 
WILL BE ROLLED OUT TO MORE COUNCILS 
THERE ARE QUESTIONS OVER HOW 
RELIABLE THE TECHNOLOGY IS AND 
WHETHER VULNERABLE CLAIMANTS WILL 
BE PUT OFF FROM APPLYING FOR 
BENEFITS HE IS FIT ENOUGH TO TEACH 
MARSHAL ARTS BUT THIS MAN LIKE 
THOUSANDS OF OTHERS THOUGHT HE 
COULD GET AWAY WITH CLAIMING 
DISABILITY BENEFIT WHILE WORKING 
FINDING FRAUDSTERS IS NOT EASY 
TRADITIONAL METHODS OF GATHERING 
EVIDENCE ARE LENGTHLY AND TIME 
CONSUMING 
WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN CONSUMING USING THAT INFORMATION AND 
PROSECUTING AND BRINGING PEOPLE TO 
BOOK BUT THERE IS A LONG PROCESS 
BEHIND THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT 
IS DETERMINED TO CATCH THOSE WHO 
ARE CHEATING THE SYSTEM OUT OF FOUR HUNDRED 
MILLION EVERY YEAR AND THINKS IT 
HAS FOUND A NEW AND BETTER WAY TO 
GET TO THEM 
AND THE INFORMATION I 
WILL ASK YOU FOR WE NEED TO REVIEW 
YOUR CLAIM 
ENTER LIE DETECTORS A 
YEAR AGO THEY WERE INTRODUCED IN 
SEVEN AREAS THEY HAVE PROVED SO 
SUCCESSFUL FIFTEEN MORE COUNCILS WILL 
BE GIVEN THE CASH TO INSTALL THE 
EQUIPMENT THIS IS HOW THE LIE 
DETECTOR WORKS IT RECORDS THE 
CONVERSATION AND FLASHES A WARNING 
UP ON SCREEN IF THERE IS A 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN VOICE AT THE 
SAME TIME OPERATORS ARE ALSO MAKING 
NOTES ON WHETHER THAT PERSON IS 
HESTAITDING IN COMING UP WITH 
ANSWERS OR IS HESITATING IN 
COMING UP WITH ANSWERS OR WHETHER 
THEY ARE TONGUE TIED OR NERVOUS 
CRITICS SAY IT MAY BE FRIGHTENING 
SOME PEOPLE FROM APPLYING FOR MONEY 
THEY CAN LEGITIMATELY CLAIM 
SOMEONE 
WHO IS PRACTICED LIAR WHO IS DEFRAUDING THE SYSTEM MAY 
VERY WELL BE ABLE TO BEAT THE 
SYSTEM LIKE THIS WHERE AS SOMEBODY 
WHO IS HONEST MAY BE SCARED OFF 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE SYSTEM IS 
EFFECTIVE 
THE IMPORTANT THING TO EFFECTIVE UNDERSTAND IS IT FLAGS UP A RISK IN 
THE CALL IT DOESN'T PROVE THE 
FRAUD IN ITSELF BUT IT IS AN 
IMPORTANT ADDITION 
IT IS EXPECTED 
THE LIE DETECTORS WILL BE ROLLED 
OUT NATIONALLY THE GOVERNMENT 
CLAIMS THIS WILL SAVE TAXPAYERS 
TENS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS PER YEAR 
AND IN A FEW MINUTES' TIME WE WILL 
SPEAK TO PAUL OSBORN FROM HARROW 
COUNCIL WHO IS ALREADY USING THIS 
TECHNOLOGY AND BRUCE BURGESS WHO 
IS AN EXPERT ON LIE DETECTORS 
BARACK OBAMA IS THE HAPPIER OF THE 
TWO HOPEFULS THIS MORNING HE WON 
THE PRIMARY IN NORTH CAROLINA 
HILLARY CLINTON MAY HAVE JUST 
SCRAPED HOME IN INDIANA 
SHE NEEDS SUPPORT FOR HER CAMPAIGN 
TO CONTINUE 
TONIGHT WE STAND LESS 
THAN TWO HUNDRED DELEGATES AWAY FROM 
SECURING THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION 
FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
TOO LITTLE IS BEING DONE TO PREVENT 
A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S FLOODS 
WHICH BROUGHT CHAOS TO LARGE PARTS 
OF BRITAINS M. P.'S SAY THERE IS NOT 
ENOUGH MONEY TO STOP IT HAPPENING 
AGAIN IT IS NOT CLEAR WHO IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR TASKS LIKE 
UNBLOCKING THE DRAINS CATHERINE 
MARSTON IS IN HULL WHERE TWELVE THOUSAND 
HOMES WERE DAMAGED LAST SUMMER 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
THE NATIONAL FLOOD FORUM SAY THEY 
THINK ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE IN HULL 
WHO WERE FLOODED ARE STILL NOT BACK 
IN THEIR HOMES WE ARE AT THE HOME 
OF JUST ONE IT IS VERY FAMILIAR 
SITE THE BUILDING WORK IS NOT 
FINISHED THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN THE 
HOUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT MOVING BACK 
IN YET THEY ARE LIVING IN A 
CARAVAN IN THE FRONT GARDEN THAT 
IS BY NO MEANS UNUSUAL IN THIS CITY 
YOU ONLY HAVE TO DROIVE AROUND FOR 
A FEW MINUTES AND YOU WILL SEE 
DRIVE AROUND FOR A FEW MINUTES AND 
YOU'LL SEE PLENTY OF CARAVANS LIKE 
THAT MANY OF OUR PROBLEMS WE FACED 
IS BECAUSE OUR STRATEGY DEALING 
RAIN WATER WHICH FALLS FROM THE SKY 
IS UNCLEAR AND CHAOTIC THAT HAS 
LEFT A LOT OF PEOPLE FEELING VERY 
VULNERABLE PEOPLE HERE IN HULL 
TELL ME EVERY TIME IT RAINS THEY 
WORRY THEY COULD FIND THEMSELVES IN 
THE SAME SITUATION AGAIN 
DRAINS WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THEM AND WHO SHOULD CLEAN THEM 
TODAY'S REPORT SAYS IT IS ONE ISSUE 
WHERE CONFUSION LED TO AN UNCLEAR 
AND CHAOTIC APPROACH TO LAST 
SUMMER'S FLOODS AN NET SMITH IS 
STILL LIVING IN A CARAVAN SHE SAYS 
THE DRAINS IN THE ROAD ARE IN 
STATE OF BAD REPAIR HER NEIGHBOURS 
ARE ANGRY IT HAS LED TO THEIR HOMES 
BEING FLOODED 
INSURANCE TRAUMAS 
AND BUILDING TRAUMAS EVERYTHING ON 
TOP PEOPLE FEEL VERY AGGRIEVED 
ABOUT THIS ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE 
GOING TO GET WETTER SUMMERS AND THE 
RAIN WILL INCREASE IS IT GOING TO 
HAPPEN AGAIN IT MAKES YOU VERY 
VERY NERVOUS 
THIS DRAIN IS ON A 
STREET WHICH WAS FLOODED LAST 
SUMMER AS YOU CAN SEE IT 
NOT 
APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CLEANED BEFORE 
THE FLOODS AND CERTAINLY NOT 
AFTERWARDS THAT IS ONE OF THE 
MAJOR PROBLEMS HIGHLIGHTED IN 
TODAY'S REPORT WHEN THE HEAVY 
RAINS CAME IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT 
TO DETERMINE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR CLEANING WHICH DRAINS TODAY'S 
REPORT CALLS ON THE GOVERNMENT TO 
INTRODUCE A PLAN INVOLVING ALL 
AGENCYS TO PREVENT A REPEAT OF LAST 
YEAR'S MISERY 
WELL THE ONE THING YOU NOTICE WHEN 
YOU COME TO A PLACE LIKE HULL IS 
THE MISERY THAT PEOPLE ARE STILL 
SUFFERING WE ARE ALMOST A YEAR ON 
AREN'T WE YET PEOPLE ARE STILL OUT 
OF THEIR HOMES STILL WRESTLING 
WITH BUILDERS TRYING TO GET THE 
REPAIRS DONE THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
PLEDGED AN INCREASE IN MONEY FROM 
SIX HUNDRED MILLION TO EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION BY TWO HUNDRED ONE 
TODAY'S REPORT IS WARNING THAT IS 
NOT A SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH INCREASE 
NOT A SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH MONEY TO 
DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT WE WILL 
BE FACING IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE 
OF CLIMATE CHANGE 
THANK YOU FOR THAT 
A MAN DIED LAST NIGHT AFTER 
EXCHANGING GUN FIRE WITH POLICE IN 
WEST LONDON AN INVESTIGATION IS TO 
BE CARRIED OUT INTO THE SHOOTING IN 
CHELSEA WHICH ENDED AT NINE HUNDRED P. M. THE 
GUNMAN FIRED AT OFFICERS ON THREE 
OCCASIONS THE BIGGEST SHAKE UP OF 
THE DRIVING TEST IN FIFTY YEARS WILL 
BE PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT TODAY 
THE IDEA IS TO CUT THE GROWING 
NUMBER OF SERIOUS ACCIDENTS 
INVOLVING YOUNG DRIVERS THE TEST 
WILL BECOME TOUGHER AND MORE 
EXPENSIVE BUT IT IS THOUGHT THE 
MINIMUM AGE FOR DRIVING WILL NOT BE 
RAISED FROM SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN A VOLCANO IN 
CHILE IS BLASTING ASH INTO THE SKY 
AND FORCING LOCAL PEOPLE TO LEAVE 
THEIR HOMES PEOPLE IN CHILE AND 
ARGENTINA ARE BEING ADVISED TO WEAR 
MASKS IT IS THE FIRST TIME THE 
VOLCANO HAS ERUPTED FOR MORE THAN 
NINE THOUSAND YEARS ON THAT BASIS WHAT 
ARE THE CHANCES OF THAT HAPPENING 
WELL EDINBURGH CASTLE THAT IS ON 
A VOLCANO ARE YOU ISSUING A 
SERIOUS SERIOUS I WOULDN'T WORRY LET'S NOT SPARK A 
NATIONAL PANIC THOSE ARE THIS 
MORNING'S TOP STORIES STILL TO 
COME SIR ALAN SUGAR HAS FOCUSED 
HIS WRATH OFF THE BOARDROOM NOW IT 
IS HOODIES IN THE FIRING LINE WHRE 
SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT HIS CLAIMS OF A 
BROKEN BRITAIN LIE DETECTORS HOW 
RELIABLE ARE THEY AT TRAPPING 
BENEFIT CHEATS CRITICS SAY 
LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS WILL BE AFRAID 
TO CLAIM THEIR MONEY PAUL OSBORN 
IS FROM HARROW COUNCIL BRUCE 
BURGESS IS AN EXPERT ON LIE 
DETECTORS PAUL YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY 
USING THEM AND BELIEVING THEY ARE 
EFFECTIVE 
ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE SEEN EFFECTIVE A SAVING OF FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND WITHIN THE 
FIRST FEW MONTHS OF OF THE TRIAL 
WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE CLAIMING BENEFIT 
WHICH SHOWS YOU IT IS NOT DETERRING 
PEOPLE WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER A MUCH 
FASTER SERVICE TO PEOPLE BECAUSE WE 
CAN CATEGORISE PEOPLE AS LOW RISK 
AND PROCESS MOST PEOPLE'S CLAIMS ON 
THE PHONE AND FASTER 
THIS IS BASED 
ON THE WAY PEOPLE SPEAK OVER THE 
PHONE HOW DOES IT WORK 
I AM NOT 
SURE OF THE TECHNOLOGY L. AM A 
VOICE STRESS ANALYSER THE FACT IS 
I RUN POLYGRAPH TESTS NOW 
POLYGRAPH TEST IS SOMETHING YOU 
CANNOT ATTACH SOMEONE TO A 
POLYGRAPH AND ACCEPT WHETHER THEY 
ARE TRUTHFUL OR DECEPTIVE THERE IS 
A WHOLE PROCESS BEFORE A LIE 
DETECTOR TEST THE PROCESS IS 
DESIGNED TO STOP THE INNOCENT 
PERSON FROM REACTING THERE IS 
NEVER A PROBLEM GETTING A LIAR TO 
REACT OR BECOME STRESSED THE 
PROBLEM IS MAKING SURE THE PERSON 
TELLING THE TRUTH DOESN'T REACT IF 
YOU IMAGINE THAT THE PERSON IS 
BEING TESTED ON SOMETHING THAT IS 
VERY HAS A LARGE THREAT TO THEIR 
WELL BEING THEY WILL BE NERVOUS 
WORRIED THEY DON'T WANT TO BE 
CALLED A LIAR 
YOU ARE NOT 
CONVINCED THESE WILL WORK PROPERLY 
THE POLYGRAPH THE MACHINES THEY 
ARE USING 
THE VOICE STRESS ANALYSER 
IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CANNOT JUST 
HOOK SOMEONE UP AND YOU ARE NOT 
DOING THAT ON A TELEPHONE EVEN P. 
YOU ATTACH THEM TO A VOICE STRESS 
ANALYSER THERE HAS TO BE A PROCESS 
BEFORE HAND TO MAKE SURE THAT 
PERSON IS REASONABLE RELAXED AND 
KNOWS IF THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH 
THAT THEY WILL BE WILL BE TRUTHFUL 
AND THEY ALSO TRUST THE EXAMINE WHO 
IS CARRYING OUT THE TEST WITH THEM 
PAUL IF YOU TELL PEOPLE THEIR 
VOICE IS BEING ANALYSED AND THAT 
THE REASON YOU ARE ANALYSING THEIR 
VOICE IS BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO 
CATCH OUT CHEATS AREN'T YOU 
IMMEDIATELY PUTING PEOPLE ON THE 
BACK FOOT MAKING THEM NERVOUS AND 
MAKING THEM MORE LIKELY TO FAIL THE 
TEST 
IT IS CATEGORISING PEOPLE INTO 
WHERE THEY ARE HIGH OR LOW RISK 
EVEN IF THEY ARE HIGHER RISK IF 
THEY HAD DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE THEY 
WILL STILL BE ABLE TO GET BENEFITS 
IT IS NOT AS ACCURATE AS A 
POLYGRAPH WOULD BE OR IT IS 
DESIGNED TO DO IS TO GIVE US AN 
INDICATION OF WHERE WE NEED TO BE 
CONCENTRATING OUR RESOURCES AND 
WHERE THEY 
CAN FAST 
TRACK PEOPLE 
AND GIVE THEM A BETTER SERVICE YOU YOU SAY THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE SEEING 
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT IS NOT WHAT 
YOU ARE SEEING 
WHAT WE HAVE DONE 
IS WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A PROCESS 
OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH 
THIS PROCESS NINETY PER CENT ARE LOW RISK OF 
THE LOW RISK WE HAVE GONE BACK AND 
DONE SIGNIFICANTLY SPECIFIC SAMPLES 
TO ENSURE THEY ARE NOT CHEATING THE 
SYSTEM WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT IT 
AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE BEEN DOING 
IT PROPERLY WE THINK IT PROVIDES 
REAL VALUE FOR MONEY 
I AM VERY 
SURPRISED THAT YOU ONLY HAD NINETY PER CENT 
THAT WHERE LOW RISK AND YOU ONLY 
HAD TEN PER CENT THAT WERE HIGH RISK IN 
POLYGRAPH TESTS YOU HAVE SEVENTY PER CENT 
DECEPTION 
LET US KNOW YOUR DECEPTION THOUGHTS ON THAT COMING UP ARE 
YOU ALL RIGHT 
YOU HAVE MISSED ONE 
WE WILL BE OUT ON BRITAIN'S SILENT 
STREETS TO FIND SOMEONE ANYONE TO 
BE NEIGHBOURLY TO ALASTAIR 
CAMPBELL WILL GIVE HIS VIEWS ON 
LABOUR'S POOR SHOWING IN THE 
ELECTIONS AND ONG GORDON BROWN'S 
TIME AS AT NUMBER TEN MARTIN FRY 
WILL BE HERE TO TALK US THROUGH 
THREE SUCCESSFUL DECADES OF MUSIC

IT IS AT THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST 
AND IT IS WARM AS WELL 
TEMPERATURES GOT UP TO TWENTY FIVE CELSIUS

HIGHEST TEMPERATURE IN THE LAND 
SIMILAR TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED 
TODAY ON THE SATELLITE PICTURES 
YOU CAN SEE BIG LAD PUSHING ACROSS 
SCOTLAND CURRENTLY WE STILL HAVE 
SOME LOW CLOUD AND FOG THE CLOUD 
THAT WILL LIFT THROUGH THE MORNING 
FURTHER NORTH EAST WE HAVE GOT 
SOME LOW CLOUD THAT WILL LIFT 
THEN WE WILL HAVE SOME SUNSHINE 
FOR THE REST OF ENGLAND IT IS A 
BEAUTIFUL SUNNY START TO THE DATE 
INTO THIS SOUTH WEST WE'RE LOOKING 
AT SOME SUNSHINE EXCEPT ACROSS THE 
ISLES OF SCILLY WHERE THERE WILL BE 
MORE CLOUD IN WALES IT WILL BE 
BEAUTIFUL START TO THE DAY AS IT IS 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND IF YOU ARE 
EXPOSED TO THE EAST COAST THAT 
WILL BE A BIT MORE BREEZY IT WILL 
TAKE THE EDGE OF THE TEMPERATURES 
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO MOVE VERY FAR 
INLAND AND TO YOU GET THE WARMER 
WEATHER AGAIN CLOUD IS LIKELY TO 
BUBBLE UP AND MAY PRODUCE 
THE ODD 
SHOWER IN WALES OR THE WEST 
MIDLANDS IT COULD BE QUITE SHARP 
IT IS AN ISOLATED RISK THIS 
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT ANY SHOWERS 
WILL DIE AWAY AGAIN SOME COASTAL 
MIST OR FOG NOT AS MUCH AS THE 
NIGHT JUST GONE TOMORROW AT ANY 
MIST OR FOG THAT FORMS OVERNIGHT 
WILL QUITE READILY DISPERSED THEN 
WE WILL HAVE LOT OF SUNSHINE ON 
OFFER WARM SUNSHINE IN THE SOUTH 
WEST THEY CLOUD WILL THICKEN 
LATER ON WE WILL HAVE SOME SHOWERY 
RAIN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS 
THE POLLEN INDEX IS HIGH IF YOU 
SUFFER FROM THAT BEAR IT IN MIND 
IT IS PARTICULARLY BIRCH POLLEN WE 
ARE TALKING ABOUT THERE WAS A BIT 
OF HELICOPTER NOISE DURING THE 
FORECAST COULD YOU START IT ALL 
OVER AGAIN WE MISSED SOME OF US 
IT IS GOING TO BE LEFT LEE SHE IS 
SUCH PROFESSIONAL LOVELY L. 
THOUGHT PARATROOPERS ARE ABOUT TO 
JUMP ON TOP OF HER HARFORD AS 
APPARENTLY DO NOT BOTHER SPEAKING 
TO OUR NEIGHBOURS WHERE WE MEET

LOST ITS SENSE OF COMMUNITY SPIRIT 
YOU HAVE BEEN OUT ON THE STREETS OF 
PETERBOROUGH TRYING TO BE FRIENDLY 
RESEARCH FOUND THAT ONE IN TEN OF US

WE ARE IN HAMPTON IN PETERBOROUGH 
AND JEAN IS TAKING MEGAN HAD FOR

GETTING TO KNOW THE NEIGHBOURS IS 
IMPORTANT TO HER OUT 
YOU CANNOT 
GET IN TOUCH WITH PEOPLE YOU

YOU CANNOT HELP ANYBODY L. AM 
FRIENDLY I DO SAY HELLO IT IS 
ENOUGH TO SAY WHAT 
DO YOU WANT L. DO NOT KNOW YOU 
SO HOW MANY 
PEOPLE HAS SHE BEEN ABLE TO SAY 
HALLO TO IN HER STREET IN THE LAST 
WEEK 
FOUR IN THE PAST WEEK VERY WEEK SAD 
I THEN CARRIED ON 
WALKING AND SAD WALKING AND WALKING EVENTUALLY I 
PASSED A PERSON L. THOUGHT THERE 
MIGHT BE ONE PERSON TO SAY HELLO TO 
AS HE WALKED PAST 
NO THERE 
EVERYBODY IS THE WEIGHT DOING THEIR 
OWN LITTLE THINGS 
THAT IS IT 
HAVE WALKED ROUND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD 
AND BUMPED INTO ONE PERSON L. 
EVENTUALLY FOUND A FEW PEOPLE TO 
HAVE A CHAT TO IN THE LAST WEEK 
HOW MANY OF YOUR NEIGHBOURS TO SAY 
HELLO TO IN THE STREETS ONE MAYBE ONE MAYBE ONE TWO THREE 
NO ONE PEOPLE PEOPLE KEEP THEMSELVES TO THEMSELVES SO 
WHAT IT IS A PROBLEM FOR JONES 
SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
NEIGHBOURHOOD RELATIONS IN THE 
TOWN'S PUBLIC HOUSING JOAN 
PEOPLE HAVE LOST THE ABILITY TO 
TALK TO EACH OTHER AND THEY HAVE 
LOST THE ABILITY TO SAY GOOD 
MORNING BECAUSE AT LEAST EIGHTY PEOPLE 
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO YOUR NEIGHBOUR 
ABOUT THE ISSUE OF PARKING THAT IS 
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO WE ARE 
TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO START 
COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER IT IT HAS REACHED SUCH A POINT THAT SHE 
NOW GETS TENANTS TO SIGN THIS YOU 
HAVE TO GET THEM TO SIGN A PIECE OF 
PAPER 
IN SOME CASES YES BEFRIEND PAPER BEFRIEND THE HELLO IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT 
OF HAPPY LIFE BE FRIENDLY IT IS 
A SOCIETY IN WHICH HALF OF US DO 
NOT MANAGE AT LEAST ONE FRIENDLY 
GREETING A DAY WITH NEIGHBOUR ON 
THEIR OWN STREET NOTHING BUT 
SADNESS 
YOU HAVE GOT TO LOOK AT IT SADNESS THE OTHER WAY HALF OF US DO HAVE 
LOTS OF GREETINGS THAT IS PROBABLY 
A GOOD SOUND STATISTICS SEEM TO 
BEAR OUT THAT LOTS OF US ARE SAYING 
HELLO TO PEOPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
SEEM TO BE LIVING IN STREETS WHERE 
THEY HARDLY SEE ANYONE TALKING TO 
JEAN SHE WAS CLEAR SHE HAD GROWN 
UP IN A PLACE WHERE SHE KNEW 
EVERYONE AND COULD NAME EVERYONE 
AND IT MADE HABIBA FACT THAT SHE 
COULD SPEAK TO PEOPLE HER HAPPY 
MORE ON THAT THROUGHOUT THE WEEK 
WE ARE USED TO SEEING SIR ALAN 
SUGAR GETTING ANGRY AT HIS 
PROSPECTIVE APPRENTICES EVERY WEEK 
NOW HE HAS SOMETHING HAS BEEN HIS 
FIRING LINE AND THAT HIS TEENAGE 
HOODIES HE SAYS BRITAIN IS BROKEN 
AND DRASTIC ACTION MUST BE TAKEN TO 
STOP ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR HE 
JOINS US FROM HIS HOME IN ESSEX 
WHAT HAS BROUGHT THIS ON 
I WILL 
TELL YOU WHAT HAS BROUGHT THIS ON 
YOUR PROGRAMME AND OTHER PROGRAMMES 
I SEE IN THE MORNING READING DENISE 
I COMMENT TWO WHILE TO MY WIFE 
REGULARLY IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT 
NEITHER EIGHTY EIGHT NOT A WEEK GOES BY THAT 
YOU HEAR ABOUT ANOTHER YOUNG PERSON 
BEING STABBED A DAY ZERO A WEEK L. 
WONDER WHAT HAS GONE WRONG WHAT IS 
HAPPENING SOMETHING HAS GOT TO BE 
DONE ABOUT IT SOME REAL RADICAL 
CHANGES HAVE GOT TO HAPPEN TO DEAL 
WITH THIS 
YOU ARE CALLING BRITAIN 
BROKEN BRITAIN HAVE YOU GOT ANY 
SUGGESTIONS YOURSELF OF HOW TO 
HARNESS THE ENERGY OF THE YOUNG 
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING BAD I I THINK ONE HAS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT 
HAS CAUSED THEM TO GO BAD IN THE 
BEGINNING I HAVE A THEORY L. BUT 
FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO SAY THERE IS 
NOTHING WORSE THAN SOMEONE SITTING 
HERE RANTING ABOUT A TOPIC ON WHICH 
HE IS NOT AN EXPERT L. DETEST THAT 
MYSELF I HAVE GOT THIS MAGIC WAND 
IN MY HAND ALSO A WISH LIST THERE 
WILL BE POLITICIANS LOOKING AT THIS 
AND SAYING HE THINKS WE ARE NOT 
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IT 
IS MORE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT SOME 
OF THESE COMMONSENSE IDEAS L. THINK 
IT STARTS AT SCHOOLING AGE THESE 
YOUNG PEOPLE FIND PERHAPS THAT THEY 
ARE NOT ACADEMICALLY UP WITH THINGS 
AND THEN A KIND OF REBEL A D. THIS 
IN THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE THEY 
CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THE LEARNING 
THEY DO L. L. 
THINK SOMETHING 
NEEDS TO 
BE DONE AS FAR AS THAT IS CONCERNED 
WHEN YOU CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THE 
LEARNING 
YOU WANT 
TO BE SEEN TO BE 
DOING SOMETHING HOUSE 
UNFORTUNATELY THEY TURN TO 
VIOLENCE ELSE 
YOU ARE A BIG MAN 
ON FIGURES AS YOU HAVE TO BE THESE 
ARE SOME FIGURES FROM THE HOME 
OFFICE IT SAYS THE RISK OF 
BECOMING A VICTIM OF CRIME HAS 
FALLEN SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE BY TWENTY SIX PER CENT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND 
FEWER VIOLENCE AGAINST THE PERSON 
OF OFFENCES RECORDED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN A 
THIRTY NINTH CENT DROP IN ANTISOCIAL 
BEHAVIOUR BILL SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
STATISTICS SHOW THAT CRIME IS GOING 
DOWN EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY NINE PER CENT DROP IN ANTI SOCIAL 
BEHAVIOUR 
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN BEHAVIOUR THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY 
NUMBERS THAT EXISTS EXIST THE 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND STABBING SHOULD NOT HAVE 
HAPPENED I'M NOT INTERESTED IN 
THAT NONSENSE STABBINGS WHEN I 
GREW UP AS A YOUNG MAN IN HACKNEY 
YOU DID NOT HAVE THESE THINGS HE 
WALKED ON THE STREETS L. WALK TO 
SCHOOL FROM THE AGE OF SEVEN OR 
EIGHT IN THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS THE 
DOORS WERE OPEN IN OUR FLAT WE 
USED TO PLAY IN THE PLAYGROUNDS AND 
STREETS YOU CANNOT DO THAT THESE 
DAYS 
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DAYS THAT THIS MORNING A LOT OF PEOPLE 
ARE PLAYING BLAMING A GROWING GAP 
BETWEEN RICH AND POOR A LOT OF 
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SAYING THERE IS 
NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO DO DO YOU 
PUT YOUR MONEY INTO THESE PROJECTS 
DO YOU MAKE SURE YOUR BUSINESS HAS 
A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ANGLE TO 
MAKE SURE THERE USED CLUBS ARE 
USED CLUBS 
I PERSONALLY DO L. DO 
SUPPORT THESE TYPE OF THINGS QUITE 
FRANKLY IT IS WRONG OF YOU TO TRY 
TO THROW IT ON TO ME AS A 
BUSINESSMAN THE FACT OF THE MATTER 
IS OUR GOVERNMENT FOUR OR FIVE 
YEARS AGO FOR SOME REASON BETTER 
KNOWN TO THEM DECIDED TO JOIN THE 
WAR IN IRAQ L. THINK WE SPENT 
SEVERAL BILLIONS OF POUNDS MAYBE 
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF POUNDS 
PUTTING THE COUNTRY INTO DEBT WHICH 
AS THE TAX PAYERS ARE PAYING FOR 
I DO NOT MIND BEING IN DEBT IF 
THEY HAD DEPLOYED THAT MONEY 
PERHAPS FOR CREATING SOME COMMUNITY 
CENTRE IS WHICH HAD LAID ON THINGS 
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO DO FOOTBALL 
PITCHES THEATRES COMPUTER ROOMS 
ART STUDIES AND EMPLOY PEOPLE IN 
NOSED CENTRES AS WELL L. THINK THE 
GOVERNMENT IS DEPLOYING THE MONEY 
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION THOSE 
WHAT I DO WHAT TESCO'S DO AND WHAT 
WAITROSE DO TO TRY TO HELP THE 
YOUNG PEOPLE IS SCRAPING THE 
SURFACE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO 
THROW THE MONEY IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION

THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
ALWAYS GOOD TO GET OFF TO A 
POSITIVE START GOOD MORNING 
ALISTAIR 
PALACE WERE NOT THAT GOOD ALISTAIR FIVE TO ZERO WAS NOT AN ACCURATE REFLECTION 
OF THE GAME 
DESPITE QUITTING AS 
TONY BLAIR'S RIGHT HAND MAN FIVE 
YEARS AGO ALASTAIR CAMPBELL STILL 
SEEMS TO FIND HIMSELF IN THE NEWS 
MOST RECENTLY WHEN IT WAS REPORTED 
THAT HE HELPED ADVISE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE ON HIS BID FOR A THIRD 
TERM AS MAYOR OF LONDON EXCERPTS 
OF HIS CONTROVERSIAL DIARIES HAVE 
BEEN PRODUCED IN PAPER BACK 
ALTHOUGH HE IS STILL REFUSING TO 
PUBLIC SOME OF THE MORE POTENTIALLY 
EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL FOR HOW LONG 
MR. CAMPBELL IS WITH US NOW GOOD 
MORNING IS IT POTENTIALLY 
EXPLOSIVE 
WHAT THE BOOK THAT IS EXPLOSIVE OUT THERE NOW IS AN ED ITED VERSION 
OF EVERYTHING I DID L. MADE CLEAR 
THAT WHERE I THINK THERE IS 
MATERIAL THAT COULD BE USED AGAINST 
THE GOVERNMENT I'M JUST NOT GOING 
TO DO IT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT 
MASSIVE GREAT REVELATIONS L. MEAN 
THERE IS MATERIAL IN THERE NOW THAT 
HAD I PUBLISHED IT WHEN TONY BLAIR 
WAS STILL PRIME MINISTER IT MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN THOUGHT TO BE DAMAGING 
DON'T GET TOO EXCITED 
WELL YOU 
YOURSELF SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO 
PUBLIC MATERIAL THAT YOU THINK 
COULD BE USED AGAINST THE LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT CORRECT 
WHICH SUGGESTS GOVERNMENT CORRECT THAT IT WOULD BE USED AGAINST THEM 
WHICH SUGGESTS IT IS POTENTIAL 
EXPLOSIVE RCH THERE IS MATERIAL IN 
THERE NOW THAT HAD IT BEEN OUT WHEN 
TONY BLAIR WAS PRIME MINISTER WOULD 
HAVE BEEN THOUGHT TO BE DAMAGING 
ACTUALLY THAT'S WHY I HAVE SAID 
IT'LL BE DONE SOMETIME IN THE 
FUTURE IS THERE STUFF ABOUT THE 
CURRENT PRIME MINISTER WHICH WE 
WILL SEE IN THE FUTURE WHICH YOU 
ARE NOT PREPARED TO PUBLISH NOW 
WELL I HAVE MADE CLEAR AND I HAVE 
NEVER HIDDEN THE FACT AND I DON'T 
THINK TONY AND GORDON HAVE HIDDEN 
IT THAT AT TIMES THEIR RELATIONSHIP 
WAS NOTED A GOOZ AS IT SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN BUT I KNOW HAVING BEEN 
ALONGSIDE TONY HOW HARD IT IS TO 
BE PRIME MINISTER AND I'M LOYAL TO 
THE LABOUR PARTY AND CURRENT 
LEADERSHIP I WILL NOT MAKE LIFE 
MORE DIFFICULT 
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A 
PARTICULARLY WARM RELATIONSHIP WITH 
GORDON BROWN L. WAS CHECKING 
THROUGH THE BOOKS NOT A HUGE 
NUMBER OF COMPLIMENTS 
I THINK 
GORDON BY COMMON CONSENT WAS A 
TERRIFIC CHANCELLOR L. GO BACK 
FURTHER IN A WAY WITH GORDON THAN 
TONY I HAD AN INCREDIBLY CLOSE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH TOB L. HAVE HUGE 
RESPECT I THINK HISTORY WILL JUDGE 
HIM AS ONE OF THE GREAT PRIPSS AND 
GORDON IS NOW THERE GREAT PRIME 
MINISTERS 
THE WHOLE OF THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
AND THE LABOUR PARTY AND THAT IT IS 
ALWAYS TOUGH AND IT IS ALWAYS A 
FIGHT AND THEY HAVE TO GET AFTER 
THE TORIES 
OBVIOUSLY AS CHIEF SPINDOCTOR FOR 
TONY BLAIR YOU EXPERIENCED THE 
SITUATIONS AND THE FLAK THAT GORDON 
BROWN FINDS HIMSELF IN AT THE 
MOMENT DO YOU FIND YOURSELF 
ADVISING GORDON BROWN ARE YOU 
CALLED BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND 
IF YOU WERE WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO 
HIM TO ADVICE HIM NOW 
WELL I'VE SAID IN THE INTRODUCTION 
TO THE BOOK THE NEW INTRODUCTION 
ON THE PAPER BACK THAT I ALWAYS 
FELT THAT GORDON INHERITED A VERY 
VERY STRONG STRATEGIC POSITION 
BECAUSE NOT MANY LEADERS CAN COME 
IN AND REPRESENT BOTH CONTINUITY 
AND CHANGE AND I JUST THINK THAT 
THE GORDON'S STRENGTHS ALL RELATE 
TO BIG CHALLENGES BIG POLITICS 
AND THAT IS WHAT THE THING IS HE 
SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON 
THERE IS THE CONCERNS RELATING TO 
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THAT IS 
WHERE I THINK GORDON'S ATTENTION IS 
BEST DIRECTED 
LIKE WISE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN 
RELATION TO PENSIONS BECAUSE THE 
DEM GRATIC CHANGE ENVIRONMENT AND 
TERRORISM THE CHALLENGES ARE WHERE 
I THINK HE HAS GOT TO PUT HIS FOCUS 
AND ENERGY 
DO YOU THINK YOU NEED SOMEONE TO 
BUFF UP HIS PERSONALITY SOMEONE 
LIKE YOURSELF 
YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE 
I THINK THE PUBLIC I'M INTO THE 
PRETENDING LAST WEEK'S RESULTS 
WEREN'T BAD THEY WERE BUT I THINK 
ONCE YOU GET TO A GENERAL ELECTION 
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE PUBLIC 
WORK THINGS OUT OVER TIME AND 
LOOK LAST WEEK WAS ALL ABOUT 
LABOUR REALLY L. DON'T REALLY 
BELIEVE THERE IS ANY GREAT PARIS IN 
LONDON FOR BORIS JOHNSON TO BE 
RUNNING THEIR CRIME AND TRANSPORT 
I REALLY DON'T MUCH IT WAS ALL 
ABOUT LABOUR COME A GENERAL 
ELECTION IT BECOMES A CHOICE 
BETWEEN COMPETING PARTIES AND 
LEADERS THE TORIES TO BE HONEST 
PATLY BECAUSE YOU LOT WANT THE 
STORY OF LABOUR IN TROUBLE THE 
TORIES HAVE BEEN GETTING AWAY WITH 
MURDER ON POLICY 
DID YOU ADVISE 
LIVINGSTONE 
IT WAS AN ODD STORY L. LIVINGSTONE SPOKE TO TESTIA JOWL BECAUSE SHE IS 
A GO FRIEND OF MINE AND TOLD HER 
WHAT I THOUGHT BUT I WAS NOT PART 
OF TEN'S TEAM I SPOKE TO TESTIA 
JOWL JOWL SES IS A JOWL 
THE PEOPLE OF LONDON SPOKE SO 
THAT'S THAT 
WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING 
TO SIR ALAN SUGAR HE SAYS WE LIVE 
IN A BREKEN BRITAIN RUBBISH WHERE RUBBISH WHERE THERE IS PROBLEM WITH HOODIES AND 
VIOLENCE EVEN IF THE FACTS SHOW 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT THERE IS 
PERCEPTION AT THE MOMENT THAT 
PEOPLE ARE SCARED OF VIOLENCE THEY 
ARE SCARED OF ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR 
AND ARE THEY SURE THAT THE PRIME 
MINISTER IS REALLY IN TOUCH WITH 
THESE ISSUES 
I KNOW ALAN HAS A PROGRAMME TO 
PROMOTE TALKING A BROKEN BRITAIN 
WHEN PEOPLE ACROSS THE BOARD THEIR 
LIVING STANDARDS ARE IMPROVING 
PEOPLE KNOW THAT PETROL PRICES ARE 
RISING TIMES ARE TOUGH FOR A LOT 
OF PEOPLE BUT ACTUALLY CRIME IS 
FALLING I KNOW THERE ARE FEARS 
ABOUT VIOLENT CRIME BUT TO TALK 
ABOUT BROKEN BRITAIN IS A SORT OF 
HEADLINE BUT IT JUST I DON'T 
THINK WITH STANCE SERIOUS ANALYSIS 
ARE PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT CRIME AND 
ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR YES HAVE 
THEY ALWAYS BEEN WORRIED ABOUT 
CRIME AND AMTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR 
YES DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS IT DO I 
THINK GORDON BROWN AND THE 
GOVERNMENT ARE UP TO IT YES I DO 
YOU ARE A BREAKFAST OLD BOY

THE HELICOPTER STAYED AWAY THIS 
TIME TIME HALF OF US APPARENTLY DON'T BOTHER 
SPEAKING TO OUR NEIGHBOURS WHEN WE 
MEET THEM ON THE STREET EITHER 
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THEM OR CAN'T 
BE BOTHERED 
DOES THIS SHOW A BRITAIN THAT LOST 
ITS COMMUNITY SPIRIT LET'S SPEAK 
TO WAYNE HEM WAYNE HEMMINGWAY AND 
KEVIN HARRIS 
LOTS OF PEOPLE TALK BEING THE WAY 
OUR STREETS ARE BUILT AND WHETHER 
WE USE OUR CARS TOO MUCH YOU 
DESIGN COMMUNITIES DON'T YOU I I WAS HORRIFIED WHEN I SAW THAT PIECE 
THAT WAS ON ABOUT PETERBOROUGH AND 
THAT PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT AND THE 
FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN YOU SEE IT 
YOU LOOK AT IT AND YOU SEE THE 
BLACK RAILINGS AROUND PEOPLE'S 
HOUSES IT IS LIKE PUTTING UP 
BARRIERS THE DEVELOPMENT WAS ABOUT 
PUTTING UP BARRIERS THE STREETS 
WERE CAR DOMINATED AND IT IS ABOUT 
GETTING THE CAR TO YOUR FRONT DOOR 
AND GETTING THE KEYS OUT OF YOUR 
POCKET AND PUTTING YOURSELF INSIDE 
NO PLACES TO SIT OUTSIDE NO PLACES 
TO MEET WITH FRIENDS PLAY AREAS 
NOT VISIBLE AND I GREW UP YOU KNOW 
IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND MY WIFE 
GREW UP IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND 
YOU WOULD OPEN YOUR BACK DOOR AND 
IT WOULD BACK OUT ON TO A COMMUNAL 
RECOGNISE WHERE YOU COULD KICK A 
BALL THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO 
DESIGN THAT IT IS JUST LAZINESS 
IS IT ALL ABOUT ARCHITECTURE OR IS 
THERE SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE ARE 
MISSING 
IT IS ABOUT ARCHITECTURE MISSING BUT IT IS NOT ALL IF YOU LOOK BACK 
YOU WOULD HAVE PREDICTED DECLINES 
IN NEIGHBOURLINESS IF YOU THINK 
ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE USE 
CARS CARS THE FACT THAT WE ARE MORE MOBILE 
WE GO OUTSIDE THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO 
SHOP WE GO OUTSIDE THE 
NEIGHBOURHOOD TO WORK AND OUTSIDE 
FOR LEISURE SO YOU WOULD PREDICT A 
DECLINE IN NEIGHBOURLINESS L. THINK 
WHAT WE FIND IS THAT WE STILL HAVE 
HIGH LEVELS OF NEIGHBOURLINESS BUT 
IT IS INDIVIDUALISED SO PEOPLE HAVE 
STRONG CONNECTIONS VERY OFTEN BUT 
WITH A SMALLER NUMBER OF OF 
NEIGHBOURS AND IT IS NOT COLLECTIVE 
THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE A NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE WON'T RECOGNISE THE 
SITUATIONS WE ARE DESCRIBING 
ON MY STREET N. O. I. SO MANY OF MY 
NEIGHBOURS BUT WE ARE GELLING 
AROUND THE SCHOOL WE ALL HAVE 
CHILDREN OF THAT AGE AND THAT 
BRINGS EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND YOU 
COULDN'T NOT TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE YOUR AGE 
YOU ARE LUCKY BECAUSE YOU WALK TO 
SCHOOL AND WE ARE BUILDING 
DEVELOPMENTS THAT END UP ON SITES 
AWAY FROM TOWN AND THEY ARE WITHOUT 
SHOPS YOU DON'T EVEN MEET SOMEBODY 
ON THE WAY TO GET PINT TO MILK 
YOU DON'T MEET THEM WHEN YOU GO TO 
SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU DROP THEM IN 
YOUR CAR WE HAVE GOT TO THINK 
ABOUT WHY YOU LOVE LIVING WHERE YOU 
LIVE WHAT STREET IS IT AND WHAT'S 
YOUR POSTCODE 
DO YOU MIND IF I 
DON'T REVEAL THAT 
IT IS IN SOUTH LONDON 
I BET YOU 
CAN WALK FOR A MINT PINT OF MILK 
AND I BET THERE IS A DELI AND YOU 
HAVE GOT PUBLIC TRANSPORT IF WE DO 
THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE CAN EXPERIENCE 
WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING 
KEVIN IS THAT THE ANSWER TO MAKE 
COMMUNITIES MORE LOCAL BRING 
RESOURCES THINGS BACK INTO THE 
COMMUNITY 
THAT'S CRUCIAL WE HAVE COMMUNITY GOT TO ACPIE OUR NEIGHBOURHOODS WE 
LOCAL SHOPS AND SCHOOLS THAT PEOPLE 
WALK TO WE NEED TO DISCOURAGE 
PEOPLE FROM OVER JUICING THEIR CARS 
OVERUSING THEIR CARS WE HAVE GOT 
TO RECLAIM THE STREETS WE HAVE GOT 
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE USE THE 
STREETS AND DON'T SURRENDER IT TO 
THE CAR 
THE STREETS ARE BUILT ALONG RIBBONS 
AND THE WAY YOU BUILD COMMUNITIES 
TAKES UP MORE SPACE AND COSTS MORE 
TO BUILD OR NOT 
NEITHER REALLY 
YOU CAN DO IT YOU JUST HAVE TO 
KIND OF THINK MORE ABOUT IT AND YOU 
HAVE TO THERE IS CERTAIN THINGS 
LIKE BY NOT MAKING STREETS CAR 
DOMINATED AND BY MAKING HOME ZONES 
WE DO REALLY SIMPLE THINGS WE MAKE 
COMMUNAL RECYCLING SO NOBODY GETS 
A WHEELIE BIN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
HAVE WHEELIE BINS BEING COLLECTED 
FROM EVERY DOOR YOU DON HAVE TO 
BUILD STREETS THAT BIN LORRIES GO 
DOWN SO YOU MAKE THE STREETS 
NARROWER AND THAT MAKES UP MORE 
SPACE BUT EVERYBODY CAN'T GO 
OUTSIDE AND PUT THEIR RUBBISH IN A 
WHEELIE BIN THEY HAVE TO WALK THIRTY 
OR FORTY METERS TO PUT IT IN A WHEELIE 
BIN BIN AND THEY ENCOUNTER OTHERS AND SAY 
HELLO HELLO YOU GROUP SIX DOWN THE SIDE OF A 
HOUSE HOUSE WHEN SOMEBODY MOANS I WANT THE CAR 
OUTSIDE MY HOUSE AND I SAY GO AND 
LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE WE ARE 
BUILDING A COMMUNITY THAT WILL BE 
MORE NEIGHBOURLY 
THE FLIP SIDE OF 
THAT PEOPLE ARE SCARED OF ANTI 
SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR PEOPLE DON'T LIKE 
KICKING BALLS THEY DON'T LIKE IN 
THE DARK HAVING TO WALK A DISTANCE 
FROM THEIR CAR TO THEIR FRONT DOOR 
BECAUSE THEY FEEL UNSAFE ARE WE 
DESCRIBING AN IDEALISTIC SOCIETY 
WHY DON PEOPLE LIKE CHILDREN 
BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THEM 
GROWN UPMENT THEY DON'T KNOW THEY 
ARE SO AND SO KID'S ACROSS THE ROAD 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T RECOGNISE THEM 
WHY DON'T THEY RECOGNISE THEM 
BECAUSE THEY GO OFF IN THE MORNING 
AND OFF TO WORK 
YOU ARE BORN YOU HAVE GOT THE SAME 
IT IS YUST THAT WE ARE JUST THAT 
WE ARE CONDITIONING PEOPLE 
TREVOR SAYS PEOPLE NO NO LONGER 
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER BY 
TALKING TO EACH OTHER WE PREFER TO 
USE E. MAIL AND TEXT TEXT THERE THERE IS A POINT 
BUT THAT'S COMMUNICATION 
WE ARE COMMUNICATING MORE WITH 
PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE 
NEIGHBOURHOODMENT OUR SOCIAL 
NEIGHBOURHOOD OUR NETWORKS 
NETWORKS ARE MORE DISTRIBUTED AND 
ON THE WHOLE THAT'S GOOD THING 
LOVE YOUR CLIP AT BEGINNING OF 
DAVID'S FILM FANTASTIC SCENES OF 
EARLIER THIS CENTURY BUT LOOK AT 
POVERTY AND THE QUALITY OF THE 
HOUSING AND LOOK THE HEALTH AND WE 
HAVE HAD CHANGES INCLUDING THE 
AWARENESS OF THE RIGHTS AND 
POSITION OF MINORITIES ESPECIALLY 
YOU YOU WOULDN'T OF HAD THAT AND 
HAD THAT KIND OF NEIGHBOURING 
WE HAVE GOT TO REMEMBER WE NEED 
NEIGHBOURS YOU NEED A SUPPORT 
AROUND YOU MY SITUATION WHERE YOU 
KNOW I I LEFT THE NORTH AND LEFT MY 
FAMILY TO MOVE SOUTH WHEN WE WERE 
YOUNG AND SO YOU ARE BRINGING UP 
KIDS DOWN IN THIS FUNNY BIT OF 
ENGLAND CALLED THE SOUTH YOU HAVE 
NOT GOT YOUR FAMILY AROUND TO 
BABYSIT WHEN YOU GO OUT FOR A 
COUPLE OF DAYS YOU HAVE NO FAMILY 
TO FEED THE FISH IN YOUR POND YOU 
HAVE IB YOU HAVE NOBODY TO TAKE THE 
PAPERS OFF YOUR STEPS AND PUT THEM

NEED NEIGHBOURS FOR REALLY SIMPLE 
THINGS THINGS LOTS AND LOTS OF RESPONSE TO THIS
