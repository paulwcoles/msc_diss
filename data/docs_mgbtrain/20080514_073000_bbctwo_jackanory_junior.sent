THIS IS JACKANORY JUNIOR 
HELLO I'M ADRIAN 
THIS STORY IS ABOUT DRAGONS 
GOOD ONES AND BAD ONES 
IT'S ALSO ABOUT A LITTLE BOY WHO WANTED TO SAVE THE WORLD 
IT'S CALLED THE SNOW DRAGON 
IN THE BEGINNING WAS A WORLD 
AND IT WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO HALVES 
THE SOUTHERN HALF WAS BURNING HOT 
AND RULED BY FEROCIOUS FIRE DRAGONS 
BUT IN THE COLD AND ICY NORTH LIVED THE PEACE LOVING SNOW DRAGONS 
WHERE NORTH AND SOUTH CAME TOGETHER 
THERE WAS A LONG NARROW LAND OF WATER AND GREEN HILLS 
WHERE TALL TREES AND LEAFY PLANTS GREW 
AND IN THIS LAND LIVED THE TWOLEGS 
THE TWOLEGS POTTERED ABOUT HAPPILY FOR MANY YEARS 
TENDING THE EARTH AND GROWING FRUIT AND FLOWERS 
AND THE DRAGONS TOOK NO NOTICE OF THEM 
BUT THEN CAME A HAPPENING THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING 
AT THE TIME OF THE MAKING OF THE WORLD 
A BOOK WAS WRITTEN 
A BOOK SO SPECIAL THAT IT WAS ALWAYS KNOWN SIMPLY AS BOOK 
BOOK WAS A HANDBOOK OF INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW THE WORLD WORKED 
AND THE DRAGONS FOUND IT VERY USEFUL 
THE HAPPENING BEGAN 
WHEN THE MOST ROYAL OF FIRE DRAGONS HIMSELF CALLED FOR BOOK 
BOOK HE RUMBLED 
TELL ME IF ONE DAY I WILL BE LORD OF ALL THE WORLD 
SOUTH AND NORTH TOGETHER 
BOOK SNIGGERED 
READ AND SEE THE FUTURE 
AND IT OPENED ITS PAGES WIDE 
BEHOLD THE TIME IS COMING WHEN FIRE DRAGONS WILL BE NO MORE 
THE FIRE DRAGON STARED AND STARED AGAIN 
HOW CAN THIS BE TRUE HE SNARLED 
WHO COULD EVER DEFEAT ME 
BOOK TURNED ANOTHER PAGE 
A TWOLEG SNEERED BOOK HE HE HE HE HE 
THE FIRE DRAGONS WILL BE DEFEATED BY A TWOLEG 
THE MOST ROYAL OF FIRE DRAGONS 
ROARED SUCH A TERRIBLE BLAST OF FLAME 
THAT THE SKIES TURNED TO BURNING CRIMSON 
AND HE HURLED BOOK INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE SWIRLING SMOKE AND ASHES 
FROM THAT MOMENT ON LIFE BECAME A MISERY FOR ALL TWOLEGS 
THE FIRE DRAGONS HUNTED THEM DOWN 
AND BLACKENED THEIR PLANTS AND SCORCHED THE EARTH AROUND THEM 
THE TWOLEGS TOOK TO LIVING UNDERGROUND IN DARK CAVES 
AND DUSTY SCRATCHED OUT TUNNELS 
AS TIME WENT ON THE FIRE DRAGONS FLEW FURTHER AND FURTHER NORTH 
SPREADING HEAT AND DRYNESS 
THE PEACE LOVING SNOW DRAGONS WERE DRIVEN FURTHER AND FURTHER BACK 
BEHIND HUGE MOUNTAINS OF SNOW AND ICE 
UNTIL IT WAS THOUGHT THERE WERE NO SNOW DRAGONS LEFT ALIVE 
BUT THEN CAME A SECOND HAPPENING 
THERE WERE MANY ORPHANS AMONG THE TWOLEGS 
ONE SUCH ORPHAN WAS LITTLE TUFT 
HE LIVED WITH THE VERY OLDEST TWOLEG WHO TOLD HIM WONDERFUL STORIES 
ABOUT LIFE AS IT HAD BEEN BEFORE THE HAPPENING 
STORIES OF THE SHINING SUN AND GREEN PLANTS 
AND THE RUSH AND SPLASH OF THE STREAMS AND RIVERS 
HIS FAVOURITE STORY WAS OF THE MAGICAL SNOW DRAGONS 
WHO LOVED PEACE AND WHO NEVER WENT TO WAR 
WHY CAN'T WE GO AND FIND ONE LITTLE TUFT ASKED 
BUT THE OLDEST TWOLEG ONLY SMILED AND NODDED 
LITTLE TUFT STOPPED ASKING QUESTIONS 
BUT AS SOON AS HE GREW TALL ENOUGH 
TO OPEN THE HUGE DOOR THAT PROTECTED THE TWOLEGS FROM THE WORLD OUTSIDE 
HE CREPT OUT 
HE WANTED TO SEE FOR HIMSELF WHAT WAS GOING ON 
OUTSIDE THE CAVES LITTLE TUFT STARED ALL AROUND 
THE EARTH WAS CHARRED AND BURNT AND BLACKENED 
HE TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND BEGAN TO WALK 
SOMEWHERE THERE WAS A WAY TO BRING BACK THE MAGIC GREEN LAND 
THAT THE OLDEST TWOLEGS TOLD SUCH WONDERFUL STORIES ABOUT 
THERE HAD TO BE A WAY AND HE LITTLE TUFT WAS GOING TO FIND IT 
EVEN IF ARGHH 
LITTLE TUFT FOUND HIMSELF SLIPPING AND SLIDING DOWN A DEEP DARK CHASM 
HE LANDED AT THE BOTTOM 
EXCUSE ME SAID A RUSTY DUSTY VOICE 
BUT WOULD YOU MIND NOT TREADING ALL OVER ME WITH YOUR GRUBBY FEET 
AH 
LITTLE TUFT HAD FOUND 
BOOK 
LITTLE TUFT SCRABBLED AND STRUGGLED 
AND HEAVED AND HAULED HIMSELF AND BOOK BACK UP TO THE SUNLIGHT 
THERE HE SAT DOWN TO REST 
AND BOOK SLYLY FLUTTERED HIS PAGES OPEN 
LITTLE TUFT GASPED 
I CAN SEE A SNOW DRAGON HE WHISPERED 
HE RUBBED HIS EYES IT ALMOST LOOKS AS IF IT'S ALIVE 
A HEM SAID BOOK PAY ATTENTION 
THIS IS THE MOST ROYAL SNOW DRAGON ASLEEP IN HER ICE PALACE 
BUT IS IT TRUE IS SHE ALIVE ASKED LITTLE TUFT 
BREATHLESS IN HIS EXCITMENT 
THEN WE MUST FIND HER 
SO LITTE TUFT SET OFF TO FIND THE SNOW DRAGON 
BOOK WENT WITH HIM 
AS THEY TRAVELLED FURTHER AND FURTHER NORTH 
THEY SAW FEWER AND FEWER FIRE DRAGONS 
UNTIL ONE DAY THEY SAW NONE AT ALL 
AT LAST THEY BEGAN TO TRUDGE ACROSS SNOW AND ICE 
AND THE AIR WAS FULL OF FROST AND SILVER FLAKES 
THE GATES TO THE ICE PALACE WERE ENCRUSTED WITH ICICLES 
BUT LITTLE TUFT WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO SLIDE BETWEEN THE BARS 
THE MOST ROYAL OF SNOW DRAGONS WAS ASLEEP 
SILENCE HUNG IN THE AIR AROUND HER 
LITTLE TUFT HELD HIS BREATH AND STOOD STILL IN THE DOORWAY 
WELL SAID BOOK FLAPPING ITS PAGES 
I THOUGHT THIS WAS WHAT WE CAME ALL THIS MISERABLE WAY TO SEE 
SHHH LITTLE TUFT WHISPERED 
BUT THE SNOW DRAGON WAS STIRRING 
SLOWLY SHE STRETCHED HERSELF 
LONGER AND LONGER AND LONGER SHE GREW 
LITTLE TUFT STARED AT HER 
HE COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY 
GET ON WITH IT HISSED BOOK 
THE SNOW DRAGON TURNED HER HEAD AND GAZED AT THEM 
BOOK SHE ASKED 
IS IT YOU 
AND A TWOLEG 
LITTLE TUFT BEGAN TO STUTTER 
P. P. P. PLEASE I N. N. N. NEED YOUR H. H. H. HELP 
THE SNOW DRAGON STOPPED HER EYES FULL OF COLD TEARS 
OF ALL THE SNOW DRAGONS ONLY I AM LEFT 
WHY SHOULD I HELP YOU TWOLEG 
FIGHT THE FIRE DRAGONS YOURSELF 
LITTLE TUFT WAS BLUE WITH COLD 
BUT HE TOOK A DEEP BREATH 
OH YOUR MAJESTY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND 
THE TWOLEGS DON'T WANT TO FIGHT 
ALL THEY WANT IS A LITTLE LAND WHERE THEY CAN LIVE IN PEACE 
LOOK AT US BOOK WILL SHOW YOU 
BOOK STAYED FIRMLY CLOSED 
LITTLE TUFT'S VOICE BEGAN TO SHAKE 
PERHAPS PERHAPS IT DOESN'T KNOW 
RUBBISH BOOK STRUTTED FORWARD I KNOW EVERYTHING 
IT OPENED ITS PAGES WIDE 
AND THE SNOW DRAGON SAW THE BURNT AND WASTED WORLD 
A PAGE TURNED AND A TWOLEG BABY CRIED IN A DARK AND MURKY CAVERN 
ANOTHER PAGE AND LITTLE TUFT WAS STRUGGLING 
ACROSS A BLACKENED DESERT 
THE SNOW DRAGON LOOKED DOWN AT LITTLE TUFT 
YES SHE SAID AND HER VOICE WAS GENTLE 
THE TWOLEGS ARE SMALL AND WEAK 
BUT THEY ARE STILL BRAVE ENOUGH TO WALK THROUGH FIRE 
TO ASK FOR HELP FOR ONE ANOTHER SO YES I WILL HELP YOU 
THE STEADY BEAT OF THE SNOW DRAGON'S WINGS 
LULLED LITTLE TUFT INTO A HALF SLEEP 
HE WAS CERTAIN THAT NOW EVERYTHING WOULD BE MADE RIGHT 
THE MOST ROYAL OF SNOW DRAGONS WOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO 
LITTLE TUFT SHUT HIS EYES AND LEANT BACK AGAINST THE MIGHTY SILVER WING 
BOOK HE SAID HAPPILY 
IT'LL SOON BE A HAPPY EVER AFTER ENDING 
BOOK MADE A SNARLING NOISE 
IT BEGAN TO OPEN AND CLOSE ITS COVERS ANGRILY 
BOOK LITTLE TUFT SAT UP WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
I'M GOING TO CHANGE THE ENDING THAT'S WHAT 
AND BOOK LEAPT OFF THE SNOW DRAGON'S BACK 
AND HALF FLEW HALF FLOATED INTO THE GREY CLOUDS BELOW 
OH OH LITTLE TUFT CRIED OUT OH SNOW DRAGON WHAT WILL HAPPEN 
THE SNOW DRAGON HEAVED A DEEP AND PAINFUL SIGH 
THE FIRE DRAGONS WILL KNOW THAT WE ARE COMING 
LITTLE TUFT HUNG ON TIGHTLY TO THE SNOW DRAGON'S SCALY NECK 
BUT CAN WE STILL SAVE THE WORLD 
LOOK LITTLE TUFT SAID THE SNOW DRAGON 
A HUGE VOLCANO WAS BELCHING RED AND YELLOW FLAMES HIGH INTO THE SKY 
AND FIRE DRAGONS SOARED IN AND OUT OF THE GLITTERING SPARKS 
THAT SHOWERED FROM ITS GLOWING CRATER 
CLOUDS OF THICK BLACK SMOKE SWIRLED INTO WORDS 
MOST ROYAL OF FIRE DRAGONS KING OF ALL THE WORLD 
BOOK HAS ARRIVED SAID THE SNOW DRAGON 
LITTLE TUFT BEGAN TO CRY 
WHAT CAN WE DO HE SOBBED 
THE SNOW DRAGON DID NOT ANSWER 
SHE BEGAN TO CIRCLE 
AND WITH A SCRAPING OF SCALES AGAINST THE ROCKS 
LANDED ON A BARE MOUNTAIN 
LITTLE TUFT SHE SAID I MUST LEAVE YOU HERE 
NO SAID LITTLE TUFT PLEASE WONDERFUL SNOW DRAGON DON'T GO 
I DIDN'T MEAN TO CRY BUT WE JUST CAN'T GIVE UP PLEASE 
THE SNOW DRAGON PICKED LITTLE TUFT OFF HER BACK 
AND DROPPED HIM GENTLY ON THE GROUND 
SHE KISSED HIM WITH A COLD ICY KISS 
AND FLEW UP AND UP AND AWAY 
LITTLE TUFT STOOD AND WATCHED AS SHE CIRCLED ONCE ABOVE HIM 
AND THEN HIS EYES OPENED WIDE 
THE SNOW DRAGON WAS NOT FLYING BACK TO THE NORTH 
SHE WAS FLYING DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE VOLCANO 
SHE CAME HURTLING DOWN INTO THE VERY HEART OF THE FIRE 
AS SHE DIVED 
THE FIRE AND SMOKE CHANGED TO HISSING FOUNTAINS OF BOILING STEAM 
THAT SHOT HIGH INTO THE AIR AND COOLED INTO 
WEIRD AND WONDERFUL SPIKES AND TURRETS AND PINNACLES OF ICE 
FIRE DRAGONS RAGED AND ROARED AND RAMPAGED IN THE SMOKE AND THE STEAM 
BUT ONE BY ONE THEY MELTED AWAY 
INTO CINDERS THAT GLOWED FOR ONE LAST MOMENT 
AND THEN WENT OUT 
THEN 
CAME THE SNOW 
LITTLE TUFT SHIVERED AND HUDDLED UNDER THE ROCKS FOR SHELTER 
HE WENT ON WATCHING FOR THE SNOW DRAGON 
UNTIL HE WAS FROZEN WITH COLD 
BUT SHE NEVER CAME BACK 
THEN ONE MORNING THE SUN CAME LEAPING UP INTO THE SKY 
AND THE SNOW BEGAN TO MELT 
BENEATH THE SNOW THE EARTH WAS GREEN 
AND THE SKY ABOVE WAS BRILLIANT BLUE 
TWOLEGS CAME CREEPING AND SCRAMBLING INTO THE LIGHT 
THEY HELD UP THEIR ARMS TO THE SUN 
AND THEY SHOUTED AND LAUGHED AND CRIED WITH JOY 
LITTLE TUFT BEGAN TO JUMP DOWN THE ROCKS 
BUT HALFWAY HE SUDDENLY STOPPED 
THERE WERE SNOW WHITE CLOUDS ALONG THE HORIZON AND FOR A SECOND 
HE THOUGHT HE'D GLIMPSED THE SNOW DRAGON LYING IN AMONG THEM 
LITTLE TUFT RUBBED HIS EYES 
WAS IT REALLY THE SNOW DRAGON OR A CLOUD HE SHOOK HIS HEAD 
HE WOULD NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN 
BUT HE WAVED JUST IN CASE 
THEN HE RAN ON TO JOIN THE OTHER TWOLEGS TO BE HUGGED 
AND TO ARGUE ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE THE FIRST 
TO DIG THE EARTH AND SOW THE SEEDS 
AND BOOK 
WHO KNOWS 
BUT FOR THE MOMENT THAT'S THE END 
BYE FOR NOW
