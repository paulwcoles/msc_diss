GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE B. B. C. 
NEWS AT SIX INVESTIGATORS IN 
AUSTRIA HAVE USED DEAN TESTS TO 
PROVE BEYOND DOUBT THAT JOSEF 
FRITZEL FATHERED SEVEN CHILDREN BY 
HI DAUGHTER ELIZABETH NOW SIX HUNDRED FORTY TWO WAS 
IMPRISONED IN A SPECIALLY BUILT 
CELL WITH THREE OF HER CHILDREN IN 
OUR REPORT WE SHOW HOW HE MANAGED 
TO DECEIVE RELATIVE FAMILY AND 
EVEN HIS WIFE LET'S GO OVER TO 
AMSTETTEN AND OUR CORRESPONDENT 
THERE 
WELL IT'S BEEN AN THERE ASTONISHING DAY WE HAVE LEARNT 
MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT WENT ON IN 
THE HOUSE BEHIND METHERE IS NEWS 
OF AN EMOTIONAL REUNION BETWEEN 
THREE GENERATIONS OF VICTIMS OF 
THIS CRIME AS FOR JOSEF FRITZEL HE 
WAS UP IN COURT HE HAS BEEN PLACED 
IN INVESTIGATATIVE CUSTODY FOR FOURTEEN 
DAYS ON THE BACK SEAT OF A POLICE 
CAR THIS IS JOSEF FRITZEL HEAD 
COVERED BEING BROUGHT TO AN 
AUSTRIAN COURT HOUSE UNDER THE 
TIGHTEST SECURITY MOMENTS LATER 
HE IS JUST ABOUT VISIBLE THROUGH 
THE GATE 
ALLOWED OUT OF THE CAR HE 
PUTS ON HIS JACKET S. LED INSIDE 
TODAY POLICE CONFIRM THAT THIS SEVENTY THREE 
YEAR OLD RETIRED ENGINEER WAS THE 
FATHER OF HIS DAUGHTER'S CHILDREN 
HE IS TRULY AND REALLY THE FATHER 
OF THESE SEARCH CHILDREN OF HIS OWN 
DAUGHTER 
SEVEN DAUGHTER AT JOSEF FRITZEL'S HOUSE 
DETECTIVES HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR 
MORE EVIDENCE TODAY POLICE SAID 
THEY WERE EXAMINING OTHER 
PROPERTIES TOO LOOKING FOR MORE 
SECRET DUNGEONS THEY THINK THAT 
JOSEF FRITZEL WAS TO BUSY WITH HIS 
CRIME HERE IT'S UNLIKELY HE WAS 
UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING SIMILAR ELSE 
SO HOW COULD JOSEF FRITZEL HAVE 
COVERED UP HIS CRIME FOR SO LONG 
WELL POLICE SAY THE ENTRANCE TO 
JOSEF FRITZEL'S DUNGEON WAS BEHIND 
A CONCEALED AND REINFORCED CONCRETE 
DOOR THE CELLAR DESCENDED SO DEEP 
UNDERGROUND THAT EVEN THE LOUDEST 
CRY FOR HELP WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN 
HEARD FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS THIS NETWORK OF 
ROOM WAS HOME TO JOSEF FRITZEL'S 
DAUGHTER AND THEIR CHILDREN POLICE 
STILL BELIEVE THAT HIS WIFE HAD NO 
IDEA WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE SHE DID KNOW ANYTHING WE HAVE NO 
EVIDENCE IT CONTRADICTS LOGICAL 
THINKING TO SAY THAT A MOTHER OF 
SEVEN WOULD HELP HER HUSBAND TO 
PRODUCE ANOTHER FAMILY WITH HER OWN 
DAUGHTER 
WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN DAUGHTER WELL THEY ARE NOW BEING TREATED BY 
A TEAM OF DOCTORS AND PSYCHIATRISTS 
THE CHILDREN ARE QUITE WELL THEY 
ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION AND ALSO 
THERE IS A PROFESSIONAL TEAM 
CONSISTING OF PSYCHIATRISTS OF 
RELATIVES OF PSYCHOYOE THERAPISTS 
AND DIFFERENT OTHER PROFESSIONS 
WHAT ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION 
TODAY THE AUSTRIAN AUTHORITIES 
REJECTED ACCUSATIONS THAT THE 
POLICE HAD BEEN TOO SLOW TO ACT ONE I DON'T KNOW WHICH FAULT I HAVE MADE 
I AM REALLY SHOCKED ABOUT THIS 
CRIME WHAT SHALL I DO LOOK TO ALL 
OF THE HOUSES I DIDN'T FIND FAULTS 
MANY AUSTRIANS SUSPECT OVER QUART 
HE OF A CENTURYMISTAKES WERE MADE 
BY THE POLICE THE SOCIAL SERVICES 
AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES MISTAKES 
THAT LET THE NIGHTMARE OF THIS 
STREET LAST SO LONG POLICE AREN'T 
ONLY BLAMING THE AUTHORITIES THEY 
ARE LOOKING HARD AT THEMSELVES WE 
SPOKE TO WOMAN IN AMSTETTEN WHO 
TOLD US THIS WAS THE THIRD CASE IN 
AUSTRIA OF A WOMAN LOCKED IN A 
CELLAR WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THIS 
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN SO WHAT COULD 
THIS MEAN FOR THE FAMILY WITH ME 
IS OUR SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT 
ALISON HOLT IS THERE ANY WAY OF 
KNOWING WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN DONE TO THE CHILDREN 
IT'S STILL EARLY DAYS THERE IS LOT 
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT WHAT WENT ON IN 
THIS CELLAR FOR SO MANY YEARS WE 
DO KNOW THAT THE TRAUMA THEY FACED 
WILL WORK ON MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS 
FOR INSTANCE TO SURVIVE THEY WILL 
HAVE TO ATTACH TO JOSEF FRITZEL TO 
THEIR GRANDFATHER THEY WILL HAVE 
HAD TO BELIEVE WHAT HE SAID NOW 
THEY ARE AWAY FROM HIM THAT WORLD 
IS CRUMBLING THEY HAVE TO FIND AN 
ALTERNATIVE REALITY IN REALITY LIFE 
ONE PSYCHOLOGIST SAID TO ME IS HE 
MAN WHO HAS WORKED WITH HOSTAGES 
IMAGINE SOMEONE WHO IS EMERGING 
FROM A CULT AND MULTIPLY THAT MANY 
TIMES OVER AND YOU MIGHT GET AN 
IDEA OF WHAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH 
ADD ON TO THAT THAT SOMEONE WHO IS 
MEANT TO BE CARER FOR THEM TO 
PROTECT THEM WAS IN FACT THEIR 
ABUSER THAT ADDS INTO THE TRAUMA 
THERE IS HOPE THAT LIES IN PART IN 
THE FACT THAT THE MOTHER ELIZABETH 
AND THE CHILDREN WERE TOGETHER 
THEY WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT EACH 
OTHER IN THE CELLAR NOW THE HOPE 
IS THEY WILL SUPPORT EACH OTHER 
OUTSIDE 
WHAT CHANCES OF THEM OUTSIDE LEAVING ANYTHING LIKE A NORMAL 
LIFE 
AGAIN EARLY STAGES LIFE THEREFORE ANY OUTCOMES YOU HAVE TO 
BE GUARDED IN THOSE TERMS FOR THE 
YOUNGER CHILDREN IN THEORY THE 
OUTLOOKS ARE BETTER THEY HAD LESS 
TIME IN THAT VERY BIZARRE WORLD IT 
WILL DEPEND ON THE HUGE AMOUNT OF 
SUPPORT THEY GET IN THE COMING WEEK 
MONTHS AND YEARS

JOHN MOYLAN REPORTS ON THE ANGRY 
REACTION TO RISING COSTS LUNCHTIME

THEIR OWNERS HAULIERS HAVE COME 
FROM AS FAR AS WALES TO PROTEST AT 
RISING DIESEL PRICE AND THE TAX 
REVENUES THE GOVERNMENT ENJOYS 
EVERY TIME THEY REFUEL A YEAR AGO 
IT COST AROUND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TO FILL UP ONE 
OF THESE LORRIES TODAY IT'S CLOSER 
TO SEVEN HUNDRED OUR RAW MATERIAL IS FUEL 
THAT HAS RISEN IN COST FROM THIRTY PER CENT OF 
OPERATING COSTS TO FORTY PER CENT THE 
INDUSTRY HAS TO FIND THE NOUN PAY 
ITS FUEL BILL THE AIRLINES CHARGE 
THE CUSTOMERS AND ADD A FUEL 
SURCHARGE WE CAN'T DO THAT IT'S 
NOT JUST TRUCKERS FEELING THE PAIN 
HERE IN SOUTH WALES TODAY MOTOR 
PROIST PAYING ALMOST ONE POINT ONE FOUR FOR A 
LITRE OF UNLEDED AND CLOSE TO ONE POINT TWO FIVE 
FOR DIESEL 
A BIT EXPENSIVE IT IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE GONE UP IN THE 
LAST FEW WEEKS WE ONLY HAVE A 
SMALL CAR THERE IT APPEARS TO ME 
YOU HAVE TO PUT AN AWFUL LOT OF 
MONEY INTO THE TANK IT'S IT'S HORRENDOUS REALLY BITES THE POCKET 
AND HITS THE BOTTOM LINE FOR 
BUSINESSES WITH A SMALL BUSINESS 
IT'S ALREADY A STRUGGLE 
IT WAS SOARING PETROL PRICES THAT 
LED TO THE FUEL PROTEST EIGHT YEARS 
AGO THEY ALMOST BROUGHT THE U. K. TO 
A STANDSTILL BACK THEN UNLEDED WAS 
JUST EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTEEN PENCE A LITREMENT TODAY 
IT HIT AN AVERAGE OF ONE POINT OH NINE THE 
RECORD PRICES ON FORECOURTS HAVE 
BEEN MATCHED THIS WEEK BY RECORD 
PRICE ON THE GLOBAL OIL MARKET 
THAT HAS RESULTED IN A WINDFALL FOR 
TWO OF THE INDUSTRY'S BIGGEST 
PLAYERS A SURBLG IN OIL PRICES SAW 
B. P.'S PROFITS SOAR TO THREE POINT THREE BILLION 
SHELL MADE EVEN MORE APPROXIMATED 
THREE POINT NINE BILLION IT WAS THE 
INTERNATIONAL CRIES OF THE SEVENTIES THAT 
BROUGHT HOME HOW RELIANT WE ARE ON 
OIL BUT PRICES TODAY ARE EVEN 
HIGHER SOME BELIEVE THEY COULD 
CONTINUE TO RISE 
WE HAVE COME FROM 
A PRICING ENVIRONMENT TO THE LOW 
TWENTIES IN TWO THOUSAND ONE TWO THOUSAND TWO TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS OVER THE 
LAST MONTH ANOTHER FORTY PER CENT INCREASE IS 
NOT INSON KIEVABLE 
THIS AFTERNOON 
HAULIERS CARRIED A COFFIN TO 
WESTMINSTER WARNING ABOUT THE 
DEATH OF THEIR INDUSTRY THEY CLAIM 
THAT HIGH FUEL PRICES HAVE SEEN 
HUNDREDS OF FIRMS GO BUST AND ARE 
CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO ACT A 
PROSEAL TO END THE DICE BUTE 
PROPOSAL TO END THE DISPUTE AT 
GRANGEMOUTH HAS ENDED TODAY IT 
FOLLOWS TALKS BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES 
MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND STAFF RETURNED TO 
WORK TODAY FOLLOWING THEIR FORTY EIGHT HOUR 
STRIKE APPROVALS FOR MORTGAGES 
HAVE FALLEN TO THEIR LOWEST LEVEL 
ON RECORD THE BANK OF ENGLAND SAYS 
THE FIGURE FOR MARCH IS NEARLY HALF 
OF WHAT IT WAS A YEAR AGO IT'S 
FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE CONTINUING 
CRIES IN BRITAIN'S BANKING SYSTEM 
OUR ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT HUGH 
PYM HAS BEEN LOOKING AT WHAT IT 
MEANS FOR THOSE CLIMBING THE 
PROPERTY LADDERTHERE IS YET MORE 
EVIDENCE OF THE SLOWDOWN IN THE 
HOUSE MARKET AND THE EFFECT OF THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH WITH THE DECLINING 
AVAILABILITY OF LOANS TO BUY HOUSES 
NUMBER OF NEW LOANS WAS DOWN FORTY PER CENT ON 
THE SAME MONTH A YEAR EARLIER SO 
WHAT IS IT LIKE IN THE HOUSING 
MARKET I HAVE BEEN OUT TO SEE HOW 
THE FINANCIAL SQUEEZE IS EFFECTING 
HOME BUYERS AND LENDERS AN TONE YA 
PITMAN PUSHED THEMSELVES TO THE 
LIMIT TO BUY A HOUSE AT THE PEAK OF 
THE MARKET LAST SUMMER THEY NEED 
TO REMORTGAGE AND KNOW IT WILL BE 
EXPENSIVE 
EVEN THOUGH MY HUSBAND EXPENSIVE AND I BOTH WORK WE ARE STILL 
LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN 
INCREASED MORTGAGE PAYMENT AND 
CONSIDERING WE EXTENDED OURSELVES 
SO MUCH INITIALLY IT'S GOING TO BE 
EVEN MORE STRESSFUL AS IT WERE 
MEETING OUR PAYMENTS IN THE LONG 
RUN WHEN WE REMORTGAGE 
THERE'S NO QUICK FOR BORROWERS 
BECAUSE BANKS AND BUILDING 
SOCIETIES HAVE BATTENED DOWN THE 
HATCHES COLIN JACKSON IS 
FINANCIAL ADVISER WHO ORGANISES 
DEALS WITH MORTGAGE LENDERS HE HAS 
SEEN HOW THEY'VE BEEN TIGHTENING 
THE PURSE STRINGS 
A YEAR AGO YOU 
COULD GET ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGES THEY 
WEREN'T TOO FUSSY WHO THEY LOANED 
TO NOW THEY'RE FUSSY WHO THEY ARE 
LENDING TO THEY ARE NOT GOING TO 
LEND ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THEY WANT TO SEE A BIG 
DEPOSIT PUT DOWN FIVE PER CENT OR SO PER CENT WHEN WHEN WILL THINGS GET EASIER IN THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET THE GOVERNOR OF 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND TOLD M. P.'S HE 
HOPED NORMAL CONDITIONS WOULD 
RETURN AT SOME STAGE BUT NOTHING 
LIKE THE BOOM IN LENDING AND HOUSE 
PRICES WE SAW A YEAR AGO 
THE TIME IS SIX FIFTEEN P. M. OUR TOP STORY 
TONIGHT THE AUSTRIAN JOSEF FRITZL 
DID FATHER SEVEN CHILDREN BY HIS 
IMPRISONED DAUGHTER FOLLOWING THE 
RESULTS OF GENETIC TESTS COMING 
UP WHY SENDING YOUR CHILD TO 
PLAYGROUP COULD REDUCE THE RISK OF 
THEM GETTING LEUKAEMIA

FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND COUNTING JOIN US FOR

CHILDREN'S HEROES CHARLIE AND LOLA 
SHARE THEIR ANTICS AT THE THEATRE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THE PROPORTION OF PRIMARY SCHOOL 
CHILDREN IN ENGLAND WHO DON'T SPEAK 
ENGLISH AS THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE HAS 
REACHED A RECORD LEVEL OFFICIAL 
FIGURES SHOW THE NUMBERS HAVE 
DOUBLED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS HEAD 
TEACHERS SAY THE INFLUX OF MIGRANTS 
WITH POOR ENGLISH IS PUTTING A 
STRAIN ON SOME SCHOOLS OUR 
EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT JAMES 
WESTHEAD REPORTS 
CAN YOU FIND A PAIR OF TROUSERS A A TYPICAL LESSON IN A TYPICAL PRIMARY 
SCHOOL IN SOMERSET BUT WITH A 
DIFFERENCE THE TEACHING ASSISTANTS 
HERE HAVE ACTUALLY LEARNED POLISH 
TO HELP THE GROWING NUMBER OF 
CHILDREN FROM MIGRANT FAMILIES THE 
AIM IS TO TEACH THEM ENGLISH BUT 
IT'S ALSO A SIGN OF HOW MUCH SOME 
SCHOOLS ARE HAVING TO ADAPT 
GOOD GIRL THEY COME HERE NOTHING 
BEING ABLE TO SPEAK ANYTHING 
ANYTHING AT ALL THEY CAN'T 
COMMUNICATE WITH US IF THEY FEEL 
WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE AN EFFORT 
OURSELVES IT WILL GIVE THEM THE 
CONFIDENCE TO SPEAK ENGLISH HOW HOW BIG HAS THE CHANGE BEEN IN THE LAST 
DECADE TEN YEARS AGO JUST TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND 
CHILDREN HAD ENGLISH AS THEIR 
SECOND LANGUAGE NOW THAT IS L. S. M. 
DOUBLED TO FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND THAT MEANS THAT 
TODAY MORE THAN ONE CHILD IN SEVEN 
IN PRIMARY SCHOOL DOESN'T HAVE 
ENGLISH AS THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE 
BUT THE CHANGE HAS BEEN MUCH 
GREATER FOR SOME SCHOOLS FIVE 
YEARS AGO ONLY FIFTEEN PER CENT OF PUPILS AT 
RECKLEFORD INFANT SCHOOL HAD 
ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE NOW 
IT'S AROUND HALF MOST OF THEM 
CHILDREN OF RECENTLY ARRIVED POLISH 
MIGRANTS MIGRANTS THE HEAD TEACHER SAYS SHE IS COPING 
BUT WISHES SHE HAD HAD SOME HEN 
HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE THE GOVERNMENT WERE CAUGHT ON THE HOP 
PARTICULARLY FOR OUR RURAL 
COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF THE LARGE 
IMMIGRANT POPULATION L. THINK THAT 
WE WEREN'T PREPARED L. THINK WE 
COULD HAVE DONE BETTER 
THE SCHOOL IS TRYING HARD TO ENSURE 
LANGUAGE PROBLEMS DON'T HOLD BACK 
THE POLISH PUPILS OR THEIR ENGLISH 
COLLEAGUES AND MANY PARENTS FELT 
THERE WERE POSITIVE BENEFITS 
I THINK THE MORE CULTURES AVAILABLE 
THE BETTER FOR THE CHILDREN 
MY SON 
OF IS REALLY GOOD LEARNING 
ACCOMPLISH IT'S A GOOD SCHOOL THE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS INCREASING 
LANGUAGE FUNDING BUT TODAY'S 
FIGURES SHOW MIGRATION IS 
CONTINUING TO HAVE AN IMPACT IN

AFTERNOON THE STAGE WAS SET FOR 
TARIQ AZIZ TO ENTER THE DOCK THE 
FORMER VERY PUBLIC FACE OF IRAQ 
TARIQ AZIZ ONCE COMMANDED THE 
ATTENTION OF PRIME MINISTERS 
PRESIDENTS AND KINGS NOW IT'S A 
CRIMINAL JUDGE WHO COMMANDS HIM 
ACCUSED OF COMPLICITY TO MURDER 
HE'S THE LATEST FORMER HIGH

ON EVERYTHING THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT 
DID HE WAS HIS MASTER'S VOICE AND 
HE DID IT ALL IN PERFECT ENGLISH 
HIS LAST MISSION TO HEAD OFF A U. S. 
INVASION INVASION WE STILL HOPE IT WILL NOT HAPPEN 
BECAUSE IT'S BAD FOR US OF COURSE 
IT'S BAD FOR THE REGION AND IT'S

WITH BEING INVOLVED IN THAT 
DECISION TO KILL 
KASIMA RAB WAS ONE OF THOSE HANGED 
THEY TOOK MY FATHER AWAY AROUND MIDDAY L. ASKED THEM

THIS IS ONE OF 
MANY TALES OF MURDER IN SADDAM'S 
IRAQ AND THE GLOBAL TROTTING 
DIPLOMATIC WHO FOR YEARS DEFENDED 
HIS NATION MUST NOW DEFEND HIMSELF 
NOW BECAUSE OF THE LATE START TODAY 
THEY ONLY GOT THROUGH ABOUT AN 
HOUR'S WORTH OF WORK IN THE 
PROCEEDINGS THE HEARING HAS BEEN 
ADJOURNED UNTIL MAY TWENTIETH IT'S 
EXPECTED THE TRIAL WILL LAST FOR 
MONTHS IF FOUND GUILTY TARIQ AZIZ 
COULD FACE THE DEATH PENALTY 
RESEARCHERS FROM AMERICA SAY 
CHILDREN WHO GO TO PLAYGROUP ARE 
THIRTY PER CENT LESS LIKELY TO DEVELOP 
LEUKAEMIA ONE THEORY IS THAT 
CATCHING INFECTIONS LIKE COLDS IN 
PLAYGROUPS HELP PRIME THE CHILD'S 
IMMUNE SYSTEM OUR HEALTH 
CORRESPONDENT JANE HUGHES HAS 
BEEN LOOKING AT THE STUDY 
THIS IS WHAT LEUKAEMIA LOOKS LIKE 
MAGNIFIED MANY TIMES OVER A 
DEBILITATING AND SOMETIMES DEADLY 
CANCER THAT AFFECTS ONE IN TWO THOUSAND 
YOUNGSTERS YOUNGSTERS THESE CHILDREN MAY UNWITTINGLY BE 
PROTECTING THEMSELVES FROM THE 
CONDITION RESEARCHERS COMPARED 
KIDS WHO GO OUT TO PLAYGROUPS WITH 
THOSE WHO STAY AT HOME MORE AWAY 
FROM INFECTION THEY FOUND THE ONES 
WHO WENT OUT TO PLAY WERE THIRTY PER CENT LESS 
LIKELY TO DEVELOP LEUKAEMIA 
THE THERE TOY IS THAT CHILDREN LIKE 
THESE WHO GET LOTS OF EXPOSURE TO 
INFECTION HAVE THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS 
CHALLENGED AT A VERY EARLY AGE BUT 
KIDS WHO DON'T GET THAT AND WHO 
HAVE A PARTICULAR GENETIC MUTATION 
ARE FAR MORE VULNERABLE TO GOING ON 
TO DEVELOP LEUKAEMIA 
SCIENTISTS SAY TODAY'S FINDINGS 
BRING US A STEP CLOSER TO 
UNDERSTANDING THE DISEASE AND HOW 
TO PREVENT IT 
YOU CAN BE QUITE CONFIDENT AND SAY 
TO PEOPLE SEND YOUR CHILDREN TO DAY 
CARE LET THEM EAT DIRT LET THEM 
HAVE LOTS OF EARLY INFEPSS IT'S 
GOOD FOR THEM AND WE CAN IT'S 
NICE TO BE ABLE TO SAY THOSE THINGS 
WITH CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE 
A FEW WEEKS IT WAS TIME TO VISIT 
BRISTOL AND HAVE TESTS IN 
PREPARATION FOR MY TRANSPLANT 
GOING TO NURSERY DIDN'T HELP LUISA 
DOCHERTY THOUGH SHE WAS DIAGNOSED 
WITH LEUKAEMIA WHEN SHE WAS TWELVE AND 
HAD YEARS OF CHEMOTHERAPY AND A 
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT 
NOW AT EIGHTEEN SHE AS MUCH BETTER AND 
ENJOYING BEING A TEENAGER 
I WENT TO NURSERY WHEN I WAS 
YOUNGER AND I STILL GOT LEUKAEMIA 
THERE IS PROBABLY MORE THAN ONE 
CAUSE OF IT ALTHOUGH THIS WON'T 
HELP FIND OUT WHY I GOT LEUKAEMIA 
IT MIGHT HELP SOMEONE ELSE 
CHILDHOOD LEUKAEMIA IS A COMPLEX 
CONDITION AND THERE'S NO SUGGESTION 
INFECTION IS THE ONLY CAUSE BUT 
MAKING SURE CHILDREN GET EXPOSED TO 
LOTS OF COUGHS AND SNIFFLES MAY BE 
ONE WAY TO HELP PREVENT IT 
FOOTBALL THE B. B. C.'S LEARNED THAT 
SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON HAS BEEN TOLD

CLUBS THAT AN AMAZING ACHIEVEMENT 
THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE WON'T BE CELEBRATING JUST 
YET AFTER ALL MANCHESTER UNITED 
STILL HAVE TO BEAT BARCELONA 
IT IS THE CLUB'S INDIVIDUAL GEARING 
AND THE WAY THEY'VE ORGANISED 
THEMSELVES THAT GETS THEM THROUGH 
THEY ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH AND WE 
ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE THEM PLAYING 
IN THIS LEAGUE WHICH WEEK IN WEEK 
OUT IS A STRONG LEAGUE AND A 
COMPETITIVE LEAGUE AS YOU HAVE
