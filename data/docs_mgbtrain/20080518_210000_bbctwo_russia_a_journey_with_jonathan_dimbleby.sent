AT FIRST GLANCE THIS CITY IS MUCH LIKE ANY OTHER GREAT CAPITAL 
BUT MOSCOW IS EVEN MORE ABOUT MONEY AND GLITZ THAN I'D IMAGINED 
ARKADY NOVIKOV IS AT ALL THE POSH PARTIES 
HE WAS ONCE TURNED DOWN FOR A JOB IN THE KITCHENS AT MCDONALD'S 
NOW HE OWNS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED CHIC RESTAURANTS AND KNOWS EVERYONE THAT MATTERS 
HE IS AS THEY SAY THE MAN 
THIS BASH IS FOR MADONNA WHO'S IN TOWN FOR A MEGACONCERT 
IN THE SCRUM OF MINDERS AND PAPARAZZI JUST A GLIMPSE OF THE LADY HERSELF 
THIS CITY WORSHIPS THE RICH AND FAMOUS 
THIS IS MY FIRST VISIT TO MOSCOW SINCE THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM 
NO PRIZES FOR RECOGNISING THIS AS RED SQUARE 
SAINT BASIL'S DOWN THERE AND HERE THE KREMLIN WHICH FOR ME 
STILL IS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOVIET UNION WHAT PRESIDENT REAGAN USED TO CALL THE EVIL EMPIRE 
THIS WAS THE ENEMY THE THREAT IN THE NUCLEAR AGE AND I STILL 
HAVE THAT SORT OF ODD SENSATION WHEN I'M STANDING HERE LOOKING AT IT NOW 
ON THE OUTSIDE THERE'S LITTLE CHANGE 
BUT BEHIND THE HISTORIC FACADE IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD 
THE FAMOUS DEPARTMENT STORE GUM USED TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY GLOOMY NOW LOOK AT IT 
BUT MY PURPOSE ON THIS TRIP IS NOT TO BINGE ON BLING BUT TO FIND OUT 
HOW MUCH HAS CHANGED AWAY FROM THE CAPITAL OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION 
THOUGH I CAN'T RESIST ONE LAST TASTE OF IT 
ARKADY NOVIKOV HAS INVITED ME AND MY FLUENT IN RUSSIAN PRODUCER TERESA TO VISIT ONE OF HIS RESTAURANTS 
LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL GIRLS HE SAYS AS YOU'LL SEE LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL GIRLS 
WHAT SORT OF PRICES DO YOU PAY IN THIS RESTAURANT FOR A MEAL 
MM HMM ROUGHLY FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A. FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A LUNCH YOU KNOW FOR A GOOD LUNCH 
THE RESTAURANTS FAVOURED BY THE IN CROWD ARE ALSO SAID TO BE WATERING HOLES FOR THE RICH AND WICKED 
WHERE THEY AND THE POLITICIANS SCHEME AND SCAM OVER SOME OF THE BEST FOOD YOU CAN GET ANYWHERE 
ARKADY WILL HAVE NONE OF IT 
LOOK AROUND YOU HE INSISTS THEY'RE REALLY NICE PEOPLE 
ORDINARY PEOPLE MAYBE IT HAPPENS BUT IT COULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE 
EVERY FAMILY HAS ITS BLACK SHEEP HE SAYS 
FOR THAT MATTER YOU COULD FIND THE SAME THING IN WESTERN RESTAURANTS 
YOU'VE NOW GOT ONE HUNDRED RESTAURANTS HOW LONG BEFORE YOU'RE AT TWO HUNDRED 
IT'S ALL UP TO GOD 
WHAT'S THE SECRET 
YOU HAVE TO BE PROFESSIONAL AND WORK A LOT 
ARKADY IS A VERY RICH MAN BECAUSE HE'S TOUCHED A NEW RUSSIAN NERVE 
MUSCOVITES SPEND AS IF THERE'S NO TOMORROW 
AND THE CITY IS NOW THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE WORLD 
AN ABSURD SIGHT 
THE NATION'S CAPITAL HAS A REAL BUZZ 
HOWEVER I'M IN SEARCH OF ANOTHER RUSSIA BEYOND MOSCOW 
THAT RUSSIA WHERE THE GREAT MAJORITY LIVE 
MOSCOW GOING SOUTH I FEEL A BIT LIKE A SCHOOLBOY I'VE GOT MY MONEY 
JUST GO AND TRY AND GET A TICKET AND HOPE THAT I GET THE RIGHT TRAIN 
I THINK IT'S PLATFORM NINE OR TRAIN NINE WE'LL SEE 
IS THAT RIGHT 
GREAT 
SPASIBA 
I'M GETTING BETTER AT LEAST I CAN DO SPASIBA 
SOME OF THESE TRAINS ARE MORE THAN A KILOMETRE IN LENGTH AND OF COURSE 
MY CARRIAGE HAS TO BE RIGHT AT THE END 
I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF MINUTES 
PHEW MADE IT 
A TREMENDOUSLY GOOD SMELL OF FOOD 
A LITTLE SMELL OF FOOD AND A LITTLE BIT OF BODIES AS WELL 
I HAD A THREE HOUR JOURNEY AHEAD OF ME 
TIME FOR A GOOD READ 
OR SO I THOUGHT 
BOOK 
YEAH WELL I'M READING THIS BOOK 
IT'S A VERY FAMOUS RUSSIAN BOOK CALLED 
ANNA KARENINA BY TOLSTOY 
AHH YOU KNOW TOLSTOY GREAT MAN 
TOLSTOY YEAH HE'S A GREAT MAN 
IT'S ONE OF THE INTRIGUING THINGS ABOUT TRAVELLING BY TRAIN 
IS THAT YOU DO HAVE THESE TOTALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE CONVERSATIONS 
SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO CAST ANY ASPERSIONS 
WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE HAD A DROP OR MORE OF LIQUOR 
THEY'RE MIGRANT WORKERS 
MOSCOW SUCKS THEM IN AND SPITS THEM OUT IN THEIR THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS 
NO WONDER THEY DRINK 
VERY GOOD 
I NEEDED HELP TERESA TO THE RESCUE 
THAT'S HIS BROTHER UP HERE 
HE'S ALREADY DRUNK YES 
LET HIM SLEEP HE SAYS YEAH 
MY NEW COMPANION IS A LABOURER 
HE COMES FROM UKRAINE BUT HIS HOME TOWN CAN'T PROVIDE ANYTHING LIKE THE WAGES IN MOSCOW 
IT MAY BE TOUGH IN THE CAPITAL BUT THERE ARE COMPENSATIONS' 
THERE'S LOTS OF EVERYTHING LOTS OF LOTS OF EVERYTHING SIGHTS LOTS OF ATTRACTIONS 
MM HMM HE LIKES ALL THOSE GAMES YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE 
LIKE FIRING RANGERS 
AND ALL THOSE SORT OF LIKE AMUSEMENT PARKS KARAOKE 
KARAOKE DO YOU DO KARAOKE 
YEAH HE DOES YEAH EASY PEASY 
HE LOVES THAT KIND OF THING 
VERY GOOD TO MEET YOU VERY NICE TO TALK TO YOU THANK YOU 
I'LL HAVE ONE MORE 
ONE LITTLE BIT MORE 
BACK TO MY BOOK AGAIN' 
I'M RE READING MY FAVOURITE OF ALL NOVELS 
I FIRST READ IT OVER FORTY YEARS AGO AND I LOVED IT THEN AND IT'S JUST AS GOOD TODAY 
IT HAS THOSE FAMOUS OPENING WORDS 
HAPPY FAMILIES ARE ALL ALIKE EACH UNHAPPY FAMILY IS UNHAPPY IN ITS OWN WAY 
IT IS OF COURSE TOLSTOY'S ANNA KARENINA 
IT IS A SENSATIONAL WORK OF GENIUS 
AND I'M GOING TO SOON BE WHERE HE WROTE THIS BOOK 
AT HIS HOME ON HIS ESTATE A PLACE CALLED YASNAYA POLYANA 
YASNAYA POLYANA IS A SHRINE TO RUSSIA'S GREATEST WRITER 
TOLSTOY IS REVERED NOT ONLY FOR HIS LITERARY GENIUS 
BUT BECAUSE HE SAW INTO THE VERY SOUL OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE 
THE BOLSHEVIKS PRESERVED HIS ESTATE FOR THE NATION 
ALTHOUGH HE ACTUALLY BELIEVED IN ANARCHISM NOT COMMUNISM 
YOU MUST BE ALANA YES 
ALANA ALANA I'M JONATHAN 
HI HI 
THESE ON FIRST YES YES 
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE THEM OF COURSE 
WELL PRESUMABLY YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE TREADING THROUGH THE HOUSE 
YEAH WE HAVE AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND VISITORS A YEAR 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WOW 
YOU CAN GO ROUND SO MANY HOUSES AND IT'S SORT OF 
NEARLY THE SAME OR THERE'S OTHER WORK BUT THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME 
THE SHELVING THERE THE DESK AND HIM SITTING 
IN THIS LITTLE RIGHT THERE AND THAT SOFA'S STILL THERE AND EVEN THE PHOTOGRAPHS STILL THE SAME 
THAT'S COMPLETELY BRILLIANT 
AND BY THE WAY THE BLACK COUCH ON WHICH HE WAS BORN 
THAT WAS A FAMILY TRADITION THAT ALL THE CHILDREN WERE TO BE BORN ON THIS COUCH 
ON THE COUCH HE INSISTED DIDN'T HE ALL HIS CHILDREN WERE BORN ON THE COUCH 
YES AND SOME OF HIS GRANDCHILDREN EVEN 
THIS IS HIS BEDROOM HIS BEDROOM YES HOW EXTRAORDINARY 
AND HERE IS TOLSTOY'S FAMOUS BLOUSE CALLED TOLSTOVKA 
OH YES CAN I TOUCH IT 
WELL ACTUALLY PEOPLE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BUT YOU CAN I THINK 
SO I'M BREAKING SO THAT'S THE SMOCK THAT WE SEE HIM IN SO MANY TIMES IN THOSE PORTRAITS 
LATE IN LIFE TOLSTOY BECAME EVEN MORE RENOWNED AS A RADICAL THINKER THAN FOR HIS NOVELS 
HE WAS FEARED BY THE CZARIST AUTHORITIES BUT HE WAS HELD IN AWE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO SILENCE 
HE WAS ALSO AN ICONOCLAST 
THOUGH HIS CHRISTIAN FAITH WAS PROFOUND HE REJECTED THE DOCTRINES 
OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH FOR WHICH MORTAL SIN HE WAS EXCOMMUNICATED 
TODAY THE ESTATE IS RUN BY HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDSON COUNT VLADIMIR TOLSTOY 
WALKING ROUND AND SEEING 
HIS ESTATE IS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE 
IT'S LIKE FOR ME AS AN OUTSIDER IT'S LIKE A LITTLE OASIS IN RUSSIA 
AND IT OBVIOUSLY HAS THAT QUALITY 
IS IT ANYTHING FOR YOU MORE THAN MERELY A LITTLE MEMORIAL OASIS 
I JUST LOVE THIS PLACE AND I LIVE HERE 
I'M ONE OF THE HAPPIEST MEN ALL OVER THE WORLD I THINK 
YOU LOOK LIKE A HAPPY MAN ACTUALLY 
YES I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN TWO OF THEM TWO BOYS 
THEY WERE BORN HERE AT YASNAYA POLYANA 
DOES TOLSTOY DOES THIS PLACE HAVE A SIGNIFICANCE NOW 
FOR THE PRESENT RUSSIA AND THE FUTURE OF RUSSIA OR WOULD YOU LIKE IT TO HAVE 
I HOPE THAT MAYBE YASNAYA POLYANA 
WOULD BECOME SOME SORT OF SYMBOL OF NEW RUSSIA 
IT'S FULL OF LOVE TO PEOPLE AND BEAUTIFUL 
YOU WANT THE MESSAGE TO SPREAD 
YES IT'S MY DREAM 
TOLSTOY BELIEVED THE PEASANTS TO HAVE A GOD GIVEN NOBILITY 
AND HIS DESCENDANT IS RECREATING YASNAYA POLYANA 
ACCORDING TO PRINCIPLES HE THINKS THE GREAT MAN WOULD HAVE ENDORSED 
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING I ABSOLUTELY LOVE 
I THINK I'VE JUST HAD TOLSTOYAN FANTASIES EVER SINCE I WAS A CHILD 
WHICH IS WHY ANNA KARENINA MEANT SO MUCH 
THE KEY FIGURE IN ANNA KARENINA BASED ON TOLSTOY'S AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL LEVIN 
WAS ACTUALLY SOMEONE WHO LOVED FARMING HE LOVED TRAVELLING HE LOVED THINKING 
HE LOVED COMMUNICATING HE WAS A COMPLEX DIFFICULT PERSON AND MY SORT OF TOLSTOYAN FANTASY 
IS THAT YOU CAN BE A LANDED GENTLEMAN 
YOU CAN PRETEND YOU CAN WORK HARD AS A PEASANT AT THE SAME TIME 
BUT IT REALLY SORT OF GETS ME HERE AND COMING HERE IS EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE 
TOLSTOY WAS BURIED IN THE HEART OF HIS ESTATE 
HIS QUIET GRAVE A MEMORIAL TO A NATIONAL HERO 
WHOSE DREAMS FOR RUSSIA WOULD SOON TURN TO DUST 
TOLSTOY'S ROMANTIC VIEW OF THE PEASANTS WAS WIDELY SHARED 
WHEN HE WROTE THE PEASANTS ARE CLOSER TO GOD THAN WE ARE 
INTELLECTUALS WRITERS AND ARTISTS WOULD NOD THEIR HEAD IN AGREEMENT 
BUT IT WAS A RATHER ROSE TINTED VIEW 
CHEKHOV WROTE PERHAPS RATHER MORE CLINICALLY AS BEHOVES A DOCTOR AS WELL AS A PLAYWRIGHT 
THE PEASANTS ARE COARSE DIRTY DRUNK QUARRELSOME 
AND THEY LIVE IN MUTUAL FEAR AND SUSPICION ALL THE TIME 
WHATEVER THE TRUTH THE STORY OF THE PEASANTS IS A THREAD THAT IS 
WOVEN THROUGH THE STORY OF RUSSIA RIGHT UP TO THE PRESENT DAY 
SO I'M ON MY WAY SOUTH NOW INTO THE AGRICULTURAL HEARTLAND OF MOTHER RUSSIA 
OUR JOURNEY HAD STARTED FAR TO THE NORTH OF MOSCOW 
NOW PUSHING ON FROM YASNAYA POLYANA WE ENTER THE VAST RUSSIAN STEPPE 
THE ARABLE FLATLANDS THAT SURROUND THE CITY OF VORONEZH 
THE BEST WAY TO SENSE THE SCALE OF THIS LAND IS TO SEE IT FROM THE AIR 
IT'S LIKE THIS FOR AS FAR AS I CAN SEE RIGHT AWAY INTO THE DISTANT HORIZON 
HUGE FIELDS I CAN'T JUDGE THE EXACT SIZE BUT I WOULD SAY THEY'RE SIXTY SEVENTY ONE HUNDRED ACRE FIELDS WITH TREES 
ACTING AS A WINDBRAKE TO STOP THIS VALUABLE SOIL BLOWING AWAY 
IT JUST GOES ON AND ON AND ON IT MAKES EAST ANGLIA SEEM LIKE A LITTLE POCKET HANDKERCHIEF 
AND WHERE I LIVE IN DEVON LIKE A LITTLE DOT 
THE SOIL BELOW US HERE IS SOME OF THE VERY BEST IN THE WORLD 
BLACK EARTH THEY CALL IT 
A NINETEENTH CENTURY FAMOUS RUSSIAN AGRONOMIST SAID 
IT'S THE CZAR OF SOILS MORE VALUABLE THAN OIL MORE PRECIOUS THAN GOLD 
AS SOON AS I WAS SAFELY BACK ON THE GROUND 
I WANTED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE TO FIND SOMEWHERE I COULD DIG MY FINGERS INTO THIS SOIL 
AND FEEL IT FOR MYSELF 
WE CAME ACROSS A GROUP OF WOMEN PICKING POTATOES 
WHAT'S FASCINATING ABOUT THIS IS THIS IS A FAMILY PLOT 
THE FAMILY PLOTS LIKE THIS THE SMALL PLOTS 
PRODUCE NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF RUSSIA'S TOTAL DEMAND FOR THESE BASIC CROP POTATOES 
AND THAT'S GONE ON THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES AND THIS 
THIS THIS IS THE BLACK EARTH IN WHICH IT'S DONE 
AND THIS IS A METRE DEPTH OF SOIL THIS IS FANTASTICALLY RICH 
IT'S WHAT WE SAW FROM THE SKY BUT SEEING IT HERE 
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY FARMERS LOVE IT 
HOW IMPORTANT FOR YOUR FAMILY INCOME ARE THESE POTATOES 
OF COURSE OF COURSE IT IS 
BECAUSE THE MORE POTATOES YOU CAN SELL THEN YOU CAN BUY THINGS FOR YOUR CHILDREN 
PEOPLE LIVE ON IT 
SOFT LIFE OR HARD LIFE IS IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK DO YOU THINK IT'S AN EASY LIFE IT'S HARD 
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT I FEEL GUILTY I THINK I OUGHT TO HELP 
SEND US A COMBINE HARVESTER THAT'LL DO IT 
SHE SAYS NOT HAVING YOUR BOTTOM UP IN THE AIR LIKE THAT 
IT'S TRUE ALL YOU SEE IS BOTTOM TRY IT ALL DAY TRY IT FOR A WHOLE DAY 
IN MANY WAYS RUSSIA'S PEASANTS LIVE MUCH AS THEY DID A CENTURY AGO 
ONCE MORE THEIRS IS A HAND TO MOUTH EXISTENCE ON THE MARGINS OF THE MONEY ECONOMY 
STALIN SET OUT TO DESTROY PEASANT AGRICULTURE AND REPLACE IT WITH MASSIVE FARMS KNOWN AS COLLECTIVES 
FOOD PRODUCTION ON AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE TO NOURISH THE WORKERS 
WHO LABOURED IN THE FACTORIES TO BUILD THE SOVIET UNION 
THE PLAN PRODUCED A NIGHTMARE 
THE PEASANTS WERE FORCED TO SURRENDER THEIR FARMS TO THE STATE 
THERE WAS NO CHOICE AND NO COMPENSATION 
THOSE WHO DARED REFUSE OFTEN THE MOST GO GETTING WERE BRANDED AS KULAKS 
THEY WERE SHOT OR SENT TO HARD LABOUR CAMPS IN SIBERIA 
AND ALL THE FOOD ALMOST EVERY GRAIN OF IT WAS REQUISITIONED FOR THE FACTORIES 
AS A RESULT WITH THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE KREMLIN 
MILLIONS OF PEASANTS DIED IN THE MAN MADE FAMINE THAT FOLLOWED 
EVENTUALLY THE COLLECTIVES STAGGERED INTO FULL PRODUCTION 
THEY WERE EXTREMELY INEFFICIENT AND HEAVILY SUBSIDISED 
BUT THEY YIELDED JUST ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED THE URBAN MASSES 
AS WELL AS THE RURAL WORKERS WHO HARVESTED THE CROPS ON THEIR BEHALF 
BUT WHEN COMMUNISM COLLAPSED SO DID THE COLLECTIVES 
IN SOME AREAS TODAY 
MOSCOW'S NOUVEAUX RICHE ARE BUYING UP THE LAND 
IN OTHERS THE COLLECTIVES HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO CO OPERATIVES 
BUT WITHOUT ANY STATE SUPPORT MANY OF THEM ARE VIRTUALLY BANKRUPT 
RUSSIA'S PEASANTS ARE POOR BUT THEY'RE AS STOICAL TODAY 
AS THEY WERE IN THE TIME OF TOLSTOY THEIR TENACITY QUITE REMARKABLE 
LENA LENA 
LENA 
WE MET A WOMAN WHO HAD WORKED ON THE COLLECTIVE ALL HER LIFE 
NOW RETIRED SHE LIVES ON HER GARDEN PRODUCE AND HER PENSION 
HAVE A LOOK IF YOU'D LIKE TO 
I'D LOVE TO HAVE A LOOK PLEASE YEAH GO AND HAVE A LOOK 
THIS IS SO PRETTY 
DO YOU GROW THESE FOR THE PLEASURE FOR YOURSELF OF HAVING FLOWERS ABOUT YOU 
SHE LOVES FLOWERS YEAH SHE DOES 
YEAH IT'S NOT BAD AT ALL THEY PAY OUR PENSION 
SHE'S ALREADY DONE ALL HER PICKLING AND SALTING FOR THE WINTER 
TWO WHOLE KIND OF CELLARFULLS 
THEY BUY LARGE JARS AND SHE'S ALREADY PREPARED HER CABBAGE HER TOMATOES HER CUCUMBERS 
AT THIS POINT WE WERE JOINED BY ANOTHER WOMAN 
SHE'S LENA'S YOUNGER SISTER ZHENYA 
IT'S HER SISTER IT'S YOUR SISTER HELLO 
SHE LIVES IN THE CITY AND IS FAR LESS TOLERANT OF CONDITIONS IN THE VILLAGE THAN LENA 
SHE SAYS LET OUR PRESIDENT KNOW THAT THIS IS THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
AND WE'RE LIVING LIKE IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
SUCH A RICH COUNTRY AND THERE IS NO GAS IN VILLAGES LIKE THIS 
WE'VE GOT NO RUNNING WATER WE HAVE TO GET WATER FROM THE WELL AND HAVE YOU SEEN OUR ROADS 
AND IT'S AN ABSOLUTE OUTRAGE 
I SAW THE DISUSED WELL BUT I ASSUMED THAT NOW THERE WAS RUNNING WATER BUT THERE ISN'T 
IN FACT THIS IS HER WELL IS INSIDE HERE 
NOW IT'S GOT ITS LID ON WHICH THEY DUG THEMSELVES 
THEY WASH OUTSIDE 
BASIN TOOTHBRUSHES 
AND WHEN YOU GO LIKE THIS 
THE WATER GOES THROUGH SO IT'S A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE CLEVER DESIGN 
TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T USE MORE WATER THAN YOU REALLY NEED 
RURAL RUSSIA IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
NOT FAR FROM THE COLLECTIVE IS A FOREST 
YOU CAN COME HERE IN SEARCH OF MUSHROOMS OR TO HAVE A PICNIC 
I WAS AFTER SOMETHING ELSE 
IT'S A RATHER CHILLING SEARCH 
SOMEWHERE IN THESE WOODS THERE IS A MEMORIAL OR SET OF MEMORIAL STONES AND PHOTOGRAPHS 
OF THOSE WHO WERE KILLED HERE SEVENTY YEARS OR SO AGO 
AT THE PEAK OF THE STALIN TERROR WHEN HE WAS AT HIS MOST PARANOID 
AND THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY EERIE ABOUT THIS BEAUTIFUL STILL AFTERNOON 
AND WE'RE SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING THAT IS RATHER DREADFUL AND MACABRE 
DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH A LITTLE BIT 
A LITTLE BIT DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE MEMORIAL IS 
WE DON'T KNOW WE KNOW THAT SOME MEMORIAL STONES WAS UM TRANSPORTED 
YES FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER 
IN SOVIET TIMES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MOURN THE VICTIMS OF THE TERROR 
TODAY THEY'RE MERELY AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE STATE 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE MEMORIAL 
DOWN HERE 
YES STRAIGHT DOWN HERE 
EVENTUALLY I FOUND IT 
FIVE EIGHT 
TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE NO ONE QUITE KNOWS 
A TINY FRACTION 
OF THOSE WHO WERE SLAUGHTERED 
BECAUSE STALIN THOUGHT THEY WOULDN'T 
OBEY THE PARTY LINE 
CONSUMED BY PARANOIA AND 
AS AN OLD MAN TOLSTOY ADORED THE FIELDS AND FORESTS 
BUT AS A YOUNG MAN HE CONCEIVED A PASSION FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND I WANTED TO FOLLOW HIM THERE 
MOSCOW WAS NOW A LONG WAY BEHIND US AS WE HEADED SOUTH FROM VORONEZH 
ACROSS THE STEPPE TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS OF THE CAUCASUS 
FOR GENERATIONS RUSSIANS IN SEARCH OF EXCITEMENT AND ROMANCE 
HAVE TAKEN A SIMILAR ROUTE TOWARDS PYATIGORSK 
WE'VE BEEN TRAVELLING NOW FOR JUST ABOUT TEN HOURS 
IT'S BEEN AN ENTIRELY UNEVENTFUL JOURNEY THROUGH MILE AFTER MILE 
OF ENDLESS FARMLANDS LIKE THIS AND THEN SUDDENLY 
YOU SEE IN THE DISTANCE LOOMING OUT THE MOUNTAINS 
PYATIGORSK IS A SPA TOWN SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAINS 
IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT WAS A FASHIONABLE RESORT 
WHERE YOU COULD BREATHE THE MOUNTAIN AIR AND REFRESH YOUR JADED SPIRITS 
BEYOND THE CITY THE IMPERIAL ARMY WERE STRUGGLING TO SUBDUE 
THE MOUNTAIN TRIBES ALONG WHAT WAS THEN RUSSIA'S SOUTHERN BORDER 
AS A YOUNG ARMY OFFICER TOLSTOY FOUGHT IN THAT WAR 
EXHILARATED BY THE FIGHTING BUT HAUNTED BY ITS BRUTALITY 
THE MORE TOLSTOY SAW THE MORE HE ADMIRED THE ENEMY 
THEIR BRAVERY AND THEIR PASSION FOR INDEPENDENCE 
THE VERY QUALITIES THE RUSSIANS WERE TRYING TO STAMP OUT 
AT THAT TIME PYATIGORSK WAS FILLED WITH ARMY OFFICERS ON LEAVE FROM THE FRONT 
A PLACE OF ROMANTIC INTRIGUE AND EXOTIC DANGER 
THE GREAT POET LERMONTOV WROTE IT IS CROWDED WITH DANCERS GAMBLERS AND BRAWLERS 
WE ARE INFLAMED BY WOMEN BY DAY 
AND BY BEDBUGS BY NIGHT 
IT HAS SOMEWHAT ALTERED 
BUT IT'S STILL A SPA AND YOU CAN STILL TAKE THE WATERS 
A SULPHUR BATH TO EASE YOUR ACHES AND PAINS 
IRRESISTIBLE 
IN MY JOURNEY ROUND RUSSIA TO FIND MYSELF IN SUCH A WONDERFUL AND UNBELIEVABLE SITUATION 
SHE SAYS YOU NEED TO SPEAK RUSSIAN 
I DO NEED TO SPEAK RUSSIAN 
AND WHAT DOES IT DO FOR YOU WHAT DOES IT 
WHAT DO YOU I'VE ONLY JUST GOT IN SO I DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT DO YOU GET FROM IT 
SHE IS SAYING THAT SHE FINDS THAT HER KNEES ACHE LESS 
SHE HAS LESS PAINS IN HER BACK HER NECK IT ALL JUST MAKES HER FEEL A LOT BETTER 
SO HER WHOLE LIFE SHE WORKED IN NORILSK WHICH IS BEHIND THE ARCTIC CIRCLE 
SHE IS A WELDER AND SHE WELDED SOME OF THESE HUGE 
AH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
SHE SAYS I HAVE GOT HANDS LIKE A MAN ALL MUSCLEY 
IT MUST BE RATHER BETTER HERE THAN IN THE ARCTIC 
THEY SAY IN NORILSK THEY SAY WE HAVE WINTER FOR TWELVE MONTHS AND THE REST IS SUMMER 
IT'S A REAL PLEASURE I COULD STAY HERE FOR THE REST OF THIS TRIP 
I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO GET OUT BUT IT IS VERY VERY GOOD 
AND IF I FEEL EVEN HEALTHIER AS A RESULT OF IT IT WILL HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE WORTHWHILE 
I THINK I MIGHT REMEMBER THIS MOMENT SOMEHOW 
BEYOND THE SULPHUR SPRINGS THE MOUNTAINS ARE AS SEDUCTIVE TODAY AS THEY WERE IN TOLSTOY'S TIME 
IN THOSE DAYS THE CHAIN OF MOUNTAINS THAT CROSSES THE CAUCASUS FORMED A STRATEGIC BARRIER 
GUARDING RUSSIA'S SOUTHERN FLANK BUT THEY WERE ALSO ANCESTRAL HOMELANDS 
FOR THE MYRIAD OF TRIBES WHO LIVED THERE 
HOMELANDS THEY WERE READY TO DEFEND WITH THEIR LIVES 
THEIR FEELINGS FOR THE CAUCASUS HAVE NOT CHANGED 
THESE ARE THE HIGH PASTURES OF KABARDINO BALKARIA 
IT'S ONE OF THE SEVEN REPUBLICS OF THE CAUCASUS 
EACH OF WHICH CLINGS FIERCELY TO ITS SEPARATE CULTURE AND IDENTITY 
THE HERDSMAN HERE HAS JUST OFFERED ME A RIDE ON HIS KABARDIN HORSE 
WHAT MORE CAN YOU DO BUT ACCEPT 
IT'S TERRIFIC I'M GOING TO GO AND CATCH UP WITH HIM A BIT 
CATCH UP WITH THE CATTLE AND BECOME A HERDSMAN 
THIS IS EXHILARATION 
IT'S A FANTASTIC FANTASTIC COUNTRYSIDE HERE 
WE'RE VERY HIGH UP 
THE OXYGEN'S QUITE THIN 
THESE ARE THE FAMOUS THIS IS ONE OF THE FAMOUS HORSES OF THIS PART OF THE WORLD IN THE CAUCASUS 
AND I NEVER EXPECTED IN MY LIFE THAT I'D FIND MYSELF SITTING ON ONE RIDING ON ONE 
I'M VERY TEMPTED TO SEE IF I CAN DO A DEAL AND TAKE HIM HOME BUT I'D PROBABLY BETTER NOT 
IN THESE MOUNTAINS THERE ARE SCORES OF DIFFERENT PEOPLES AND A HOST OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES 
SO MANY THAT THEY SAY THAT WHEN GOD SPRINKLED THE NATIONS OVER THE EARTH 
HE DROPPED HIS SHAKER ON THE CAUCASUS 
THERE'S OFTEN BEEN STRIFE BETWEEN THEM BUT NOTHING 
TO COMPARE WITH THEIR COMMON HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE RUSSIANS 
SPASIBO 
THE MOUNTAIN PEOPLE ARE TOUGH 
THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO SUBDUE THEM IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LASTED A GOOD TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
BYE BYE 
AND DEEP DOWN THEY'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN SUBDUED 
THEY STILL BELIEVE THE CAUCASUS BELONGS TO THEM NOT TO RUSSIA 
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON OUR WAY BY NOW 
BUT HOW COULD I REFUSE AN INVITATION TO A WEDDING IN THE CAUCASUS 
THE PREPARATIONS START EARLY IN THE MORNING 
A SHEEP IS A WEDDING GIFT WHICH WILL BE SLAUGHTERED FOR THE FEAST 
EVERYONE BRINGS SOMETHING 
BY TRADITION THERE'S A COURT JESTER AS WELL FIERCESOME BUT FUNNY 
THE WOMEN HAVE GRACE BUT IT'S THE MEN WHO TAKE THE STARRING ROLE 
SWORDSMEN STRUTTING THEIR STUFF 
THE SAME STEPS THAT THEIR FOREFATHERS USED IN MORTAL COMBAT ONLY A FEW GENERATIONS AGO 
THEY MADE ME TRY AS WELL THOROUGHLY EMBARRASSING 
THE WEDDING IS NOT ONLY A CELEBRATION BUT A REMINDER THAT 
THESE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR ROOTS IN A WARRIOR CULTURE 
NOT SO LONG AGO MY DRIVER ON THE LEFT HERE 
CROSSED THE MOUNTAINS INTO ABKASIA TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE HIS BROTHERS 
IN THEIR STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE NOT FROM RUSSIA BUT GEORGIA 
EVERYONE IN THE VILLAGE HAS KNOWN THE BRIDE SINCE SHE WAS A BABY 
BUT THERE'S STILL A MOMENT OF SUSPENSE HER UNVEILING 
TRADITION REQUIRES THE BRIDE TO BE KIDNAPPED BY THE BRIDEGROOM 
TWO WEEKS BEFORE THEIR WEDDING 
AFTER THAT THERE'S A TIT FOR TAT AND THEN A RANSOM OR AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING 
THE BRIDEGROOM'S MOTHER IS BEING HELD CAPTIVE BY THE BRIDE'S FAMILY 
AND THE BRIDEGROOM'S MOTHER'S SON WHO'S NOT GETTING MARRIED BUT IS THE SON HAS TO BUY BACK HIS MOTHER 
GOT IT 
AS THE SUN BEGINS TO SET SOMEONE IS STILL MISSING 
THE MA N. HIMSELF 
HIS FIRST TASK IS TO APOLOGISE TO THE BRIDE'S FAMILY 
FOR KIDNAPPING THEIR DAUGHTER BUT HE STILL GETS HIS COMEUPPANCE 
ONLY NOW CAN THE HAPPY COUPLE TIE THE KNOT 
AN APPROPRIATE MOMENT TO LEAVE THEM TO IT 
FROM THE WEDDING IN KABARDINO BALKARIA 
WE HEADED EAST THROUGH THE CAUCASUS TOWARDS DAGHESTAN AND THE CASPIAN SEA 
BUT ON OUR WAY WE PAUSED TO VISIT A BITTER REMINDER OF THE CHECHEN WAR BESLAN 
TO REACH BESLAN WE HAD TO CROSS INTO NORTH OSSETIA 
THE ONLY CHRISTIAN REPUBLIC IN THE RUSSIAN CAUCASUS 
THE SAME ROUTE THAT WAS TAKEN ONE MORNING IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
BY TERRORISTS FIGHTING FOR CHECHEN INDEPENDENCE 
IT WAS SEPTEMBER FIRST THE START OF THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR 
THREE DAYS LATER BESLAN BECAME A SLAUGHTERHOUSE 
THE GUNMEN HAD SEIZED MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN PARENTS AND TEACHERS 
IF THE IDEA WAS TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE CHECHEN CAUSE 
IT WAS A HIDEOUS ERROR OF JUDGEMENT 
THE GUNMEN HAD HERDED MOST OF THEIR HOSTAGES INTO THE GYMNASIUM 
ON THE THIRD DAY RUSSIAN TROOPS STORMED THE BUILDING 
IN A CHAOS OF GUN FIRE AND BOMBS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR HOSTAGES DIED 
ONE EIGHTY SIX OF THEM WERE CHILDREN 
EVEN WHEN YOU'VE SEEN THE PICTURES AND READ ABOUT IT 
TO COME IN HERE AND ACTUALLY SEE THE PLACE IS 
IT'S COMPLETELY HEARTBREAKING 
ALL THESE RUINED LIVES 
WRITING OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO ABOUT THESE STRUGGLES IN THE CAUCASUS 
TOLSTOY SAID IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS NOT ROOM FOR ALL MEN ON THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH 
CAN IT BE THAT AMIDST THIS ENCHANTING NATURE 
FEELINGS OF HATRED VENGEANCE AND A DESIRE TO EXTERMINATE THEIR FELLOW BEINGS 
CAN ENDURE IN THE SOULS OF MEN 
THAT WAS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO 
WE DROVE ON ACROSS THE APPARENTLY ENDLESS STEPPE NORTH OF BESLAN 
EN ROUTE TO THE CASPIAN SEA 
WE'VE JUST CROSSED THE BORDER INTO DAGHESTAN 
AND WE'RE UNLOADING FROM ONE VEHICLE INTO ANOTHER ALL OUR GEAR BECAUSE 
UM IT'S GENERALLY THOUGHT DEEMED WISER FOR US TO RELY ON DRIVERS IN DAGHESTAN 
WHO KNOW THE TERRITORY AND CAN MAKE SURE WE DON'T GET INTO ANY UNNECESSARY TROUBLE 
WE'RE FILMING THIS IN A SURREPTITIOUS WAY BECAUSE 
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE POLICE AUTHORITIES HERE 
IF THEY KNOW WE'RE FILMING WOULD STOP US DOING IT 
ALTHOUGH THE REPUBLICS OF THE RUSSIAN CAUCASUS BELONG TO THE FEDERATION 
THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN BORDERS AND THEIR OWN POLICE 
WHO CAN BE A TOUCH UNPREDICTABLE 
OUR CONTACT IN DAGHESTAN IS MORE THAN A BAGGAGE HANDLER 
KHAN IS A CLAN LEADER WHO CARRIES REAL CLOUT IN THIS SOMETIMES LAWLESS LAND 
OUR FIRST STOP IS A CURIOUS ANOMALY 
A VILLAGE THAT'S POPULATED ENTIRELY BY CHECHENS BUT JUST INSIDE THE REPUBLIC OF DAGHESTAN 
KHAN IS AN ELDER A STARSHII 
SO LONG SO LONG 
HE ENJOYS AUTOMATIC RESPECT 
AS I DISCOVERED THE HISTORY OF THIS VILLAGE 
I BEGAN TO REALISE WHY ATROCITIES LIKE BESLAN CAN STILL HAPPEN 
I FOUND SOME OLD MEN WHO TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM HERE IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
THE EPISODE IS INDELIBLY ETCHED IN THEIR MEMORY 
IN THE FREEZING WINTER OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR RUSSIAN SOLDIERS ENTERED THE VILLAGE 
AND ROUNDED UP EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD 
THEY WERE HERDED INTO CATTLE TRUCKS AND SHIPPED OFF TO SOVIET CENTRAL ASIA 
AT GUNPOINT YEAH 
EVERY CHECHEN THE WHOLE NATION WAS DEPORTED 
THEY HAD NO FOOD NO WATER NO HEATING 
ONE IN EVERY FIVE OF THEM DIED ON THE WAY 
WHEN SOMEONE DIED THERE WAS NO EQUIPMENT NOTHING TO DIG THE GRAVE 
AND THEY FOUND ANYWHERE IF THEY FOUND WALL 
THEN THEY'D TAKE OUT SOME STONES PUT THE DEAD BODY THERE AND THEN COVER IT BY STONES 
STALIN APPARENTLY THOUGHT THE CHECHENS WERE COLLABORATING WITH THE NAZIS 
FOR THIS ALLEGED BETRAYAL THESE OLD MEN WHO WERE THEN CHILDREN WERE RAISED IN EXILE 
THEY DREAMED OF HOME 
THREE YEARS AFTER STALIN'S DEATH THEY WERE REPRIEVED 
AND THEY RETURNED BUT THEY'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN OR FORGIVEN 
WE CAN BE SURE NOR WILL THEIR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN 
NOT FAR FROM THE CHECHEN VILLAGE WE ENTERED THE FLOOD PLAINS THAT BORDER THE RIVER TEREK 
IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE TEREK FORMED A NATURAL FRONTIER 
AGAINST THE EXPANDING RUSSIAN EMPIRE 
WHOSE ARMIES WERE DRIVING SOUTH DETERMINED TO CONQUER THE CAUCASUS ONCE AND FOR ALL 
AT THAT TIME THE RUSSIAN FRONT WAS SPEARHEADED BY A PHALANX OF SHOCK TROOPS 
WHO WERE AS FAMED AS THEY WERE FEARED THE COSSACKS 
TODAY I'M GOING FISHING WITH SOME OF THEIR DESCENDANTS 
IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THE COSSACKS ARE A RESURGENT FORCE 
XENOPHOBIC THUGS WHO LIKE GIVING RUSSIA'S MINORITIES A ROUGH TIME 
BUT HERE IN DAGHESTAN THE TEREK COSSACKS ARE THEMSELVES A MINORITY AND THEY BEHAVE ACCORDINGLY 
PLACIDO DOMINGO OF OUR TIME 
THEN PLACIDO DOMINGO CAN'T COMPETE WITH HIM 
IT WAS ON THIS FRONT THAT TOLSTOY FOUGHT ALONGSIDE THE COSSACKS AND HE CAME TO ADMIRE THEM 
NOT BECAUSE THEY HATED THEIR ENEMIES IN THE MOUNTAINS BEYOND THE RIVER 
BUT FOR THEIR COURAGE IN BATTLE AGAINST THEM 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR GUN PETR 
BUT WHEN HE REALLY LIKED WAS ANOTHER SIDE OF THE COSSACK CHARACTER 
THEIR SIMPLE LIFE THEIR LOVE OF THE OUTDOORS AND THEIR GLORIOUS INDEPENDENCE OF SPIRIT 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE 
IT'S HUGE CAN WE TAKE IT OUT AND LOOK 
CAN WE TAKE IT OUT AND LOOK 
SORRY TO SAY EVEN COSSACKS CAN BE POACHERS 
THE PRINCIPLE INGREDIENTS FOR UKHA 
RUSSIA'S FAMOUS FISH SOUP HAD BEING CAUGHT ILLEGALLY WITH NETS' 
VERY ALIVE 
I SOON DISCOVERED THAT OUR CHEF FOR THE DAY 
IS NOT GIVEN TO HIDING HIS FEELINGS NOR IS POLITICAL CORRECTNESS HIS STRONG SUIT 
NIKOLAI NIKOLAI 
YOU ENJOY DOING THIS YES 
AND YOU'RE A PROUD COSSACK YES 
WHAT IS IT TO BE A COSSACK WHAT MAKES A COSSACK DIFFERENT 
IT MEANS TO BE ABLE TO LIKE RUN YOUR CARS YOUR 
MY COSSACK TRANSLATOR IS GETTING LOST FOR WORDS' 
DO YOU HAVE A BIG FAITH IN RUSSIA IN MOTHER RUSSIA 
YEAH ABSOLUTELY 
HE SAYS WHEN BEER THE BEAR 
BEAR THE BEAR WAKES UP THEN EVERYTHING WILL BE O. K. 
BECAUSE THE BEAR RESEMBLES THE RUSSIA THE TRUE RUSSIA 
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK IS THE TRUE RUSSIA 
IN A SINGLE PHRASE LIKE RUSSIA IS THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE 
SPASIBA 
VERY VERY MUCH 
WHILE NIKOLAI GETS ON WITH HIS COOKING HIS LEADER PETR GOES SHOOTING 
THEN WE EAT 
WE DRINK 
AND INEVITABLY WE SING 
IT'S MANY GENERATIONS SINCE THEIR FOREBEARS FOUGHT AGAINST THE ISLAMIC TRIBES OF THE CAUCASUS 
BUT I SUSPECT EVEN NOW THEY'RE NOSTALGIC FOR THAT HOLY WAR AGAINST THE INFIDELS' 
THAT WAR WAS FOUGHT IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE CENTRE OF RESISTANCE WAS HERE IN DAGHESTAN 
FOR ONCE THE DISPARATE TRIBES OF THE CAUCASUS WERE UNITED 
THEIR LEADER WAS SHEIKH SHAMIL WHOSE SPIRIT STILL HOVERS OVER THE MOUNTAINS 
FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES HE OUTWITTED THE MIGHT OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE 
BUT SHAMIL WAS OUTNUMBERED AND OUTGUNNED 
HIS LAST STAND WAS JUST OUTSIDE THIS VILLAGE GUNIB 
IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY ROMANTIC STORY 
SHAMIL ON HIS WHITE HORSE 
TWENTY FIVE YEARS HE LEADS THE CAUCASIAN PEOPLE IN AN EPIC STRUGGLE 
AGAINST THE RUSSIAN INVADERS THE IMPERIAL ARMY 
AND GRADUALLY THE IMPERIAL ARMY ENCIRCLES HIM 
UNTIL HE FINDS HIMSELF WE'RE NOW SOME SIX THOUSAND FEET UP IN THE MOUNTAINS 
HE FINDS HIMSELF ENCIRCLED THE NOOSE AROUND HIS NECK DOWN TO HIS LAST FOUR HUNDRED MEN 
AND HIS FAMILY HIS SON IN PARTICULAR SAID YOU'VE GOT TO SURRENDER 
SO HE RODE OUT DOWN HERE WITH HIS RETINUE ON HIS WHITE HORSE 
ALL AROUND HIM WERE RUSSIAN SOLDIERS AND THEY STARTED TO JEER HIM 
AND SHOUT AT HIM AND SHOUT HOORAH HOORAH 
AND HE WENT TO TURN BACK AND SAID IF THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING TO BE I WON'T SURRENDER 
THE ORDER CAME UP THEN FROM THE RUSSIAN GENERAL TO HIS TROOPS 
SILENCE AND THERE WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE 
SHAMIL'S EXTRAORDINARY FEAT OF RESISTANCE HAD MADE HIM FAMOUS ALL ACROSS EUROPE 
SO GREAT WAS HIS RENOWN THAT EVEN THE CZAR FELT OBLIGED TO TREAT HIS PRISONER WITH HONOUR 
AND TODAY HE REMAINS A SYMBOL OF DEFIANCE IN THESE MOUNTAIN PASSES AND BEYOND 
ON OUR WAY DOWN TO THE CASPIAN SEA KHAN STOPPED OFF TO SHOW ME DAGHESTAN'S FINEST WEEKLY MARKET 
IT'S QUITE A SCENE HERE KHAN 
YEAH THIS IS THE BIGGEST MARKET IN DAGHESTAN AMAZING 
WALKING THROUGH THIS OPEN AIR SHOPPING MALL I BEGAN TO APPRECIATE 
SHAMIL'S ASTONISHING ACHIEVEMENT IN UNITING THE TRIBES OF THE CAUCASUS 
THEY MUST SPEAK AT LEAST A DOZEN LANGUAGES IN THIS MARKET ALONE 
THERE ARE THIRTY FOUR CLANS IN DAGHESTAN AND EVEN NOW BLOOD FEUDS AND VENDETTAS BETWEEN THEM 
NOT TO MENTION KIDNAPPINGS TEND TO SCARE VISITORS AWAY 
WHEN WE WERE PLANNING ON COMING HERE 
THERE'S A THING CALLED A FOREIGN OFFICE ADVISORY 
AND WE WERE TOLD IT'S NOT SAFE TO GO TO DAGHESTAN BECAUSE OF ROBBERY KIDNAPPING AND EVEN WORSE 
WELL RIGHT NOW YOU ARE IN THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE IN DAGHESTAN 
YOU CAN BE KIDNAPPED BY THE TRADERS 
BY THESE LADIES WELL AND THEY BUSINESS WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS THE MOST DANGEROUS BUSINESS 
BUT KHAN HAS NO ILLUSIONS 
HE KNOWS VERY WELL THERE ARE ISLAMIST INSURGENTS HIDING IN THE MOUNTAINS 
AND HE ALSO KNOWS THAT IN THIS MUSLIM SOCIETY THEY WILL ALWAYS FIND SOME SUPPORT 
HE KNOWS THEY'RE HERE AND HE WANTS THEM OUT 
WHAT IS YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THESE PEOPLE COS THEY STILL EXIST UNDERGROUND DON'T THEY 
YES THEY STILL EXIST BUT THE TRAGIC THING IS THAT UM 
THEY DO NOT REPRESENT NOT ONLY ANY DAGHESTANI VILLAGE 
THEY DO NOT REPRESENT ANY DAGHESTANI HAMLET 
THESE PEOPLE ARE OUT OF DAGHESTAN SOCIETY 
YOU'RE A FATHER YOU'VE GOT A FAMILY DO YOU FEAR THEM 
I'M AFRAID OF THEM 
MY PERCEPTION IS THAT WE SHOULD TREAT THEM AS ORDINARY CRIMINALS NOT AS A PART OF DAGHESTAN SOCIETY 
IN THE DISTANCE BELOW THE MOUNTAINS TO THE EAST IS THE CASPIAN SEA 
ON ITS SHORES THE MOST SOUTHERLY AND THE OLDEST CITY IN RUSSIA DERBENT 
DERBENT WAS FIRST SETTLED AT LEAST FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
THE GREAT FORTRESS WHICH OVERLOOKS THE HARBOUR WAS BUILT BY THE PERSIANS A MERE FIFTEEN CENTURIES AGO 
TO PROTECT THE CITY FROM INVASION FROM THE NORTH 
BUT ITS STRATEGIC LOCATION MADE IT A MAGNET FOR THE CZARS 
HERE WE ARE IN THE OLDEST CITY IN RUSSIA THAT'S RIGHT 
AND SOMEHOW IT HASN'T BEEN RUINED HOW'S THAT 
IN FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THEY BUILT ALL THESE FORTIFICATIONS 
AND THESE WALLS UP TO THE MOUNTAINS GOES APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY MILES 
IT IS COMPARED WITH THE GREAT CHINESE WALL WITH HADRIAN WALL 
AND THERE ARE THREE FORTIFICATIONS AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM 
BUT DERBENT WAS ABOVE ALL A CITY OF TRADERS AND IT SURVIVED BECAUSE THE MERCHANTS 
WERE READY TO CUT A DEAL WITH ALMOST ANYONE TO KEEP THE PEACE 
WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY CEREMONIALLY GAVE THE KEY OF CITY 
AND THE HISTORICAL MANUSCRIPT CALLED THE HISTORY OF DERBENT 
AND THEY SAID THAT YOU ARE WINNERS 
THIS CITY BELONGS TO YOU AND WHEN PETER I CAME TO DERBENT 
THEY GAVE HIM THE KEYS PETER WE WELCOME YOU YOU CAN HAVE THE KEYS 
AND YOU RULE US YES 
WHAT DOES THIS TELL US ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF DERBENT 
IT TELLS THAT IN SOME WAY THEY CAME TO PHILOSOPHY THAT THERE IS NO REASON TO FIGHT AGAINST ANYONE 
THE REASON IS TO KEEP PEACEFUL LIFE AND IF SOMEONE WANT TO RULE US 
LET HIM DO IT BUT WHY WAR 
AND THIS IS A VERY YOU KNOW 
IT IS VERY DIFFERENT STORY WITH THIS CITY COMPARING WITH THE STORY OF DAGHESTAN ABSOLUTELY 
TODAY AFTER LONG YEARS IN WHICH THE ORTHODOX CHURCH AND THEN THE COMMUNIST STATE HELD SWAY 
DERBENT IS NOW FREE TO CELEBRATE ITS ORIGINS AS ONE OF ISLAM'S MOST HOLY CITIES' 
THIS IS THE FAMOUS MOSQUE YES YEAH 
DZHUMA MOSQUE IS THE FOURTH MOST IMPORTANT SITE IN ALL ISLAM 
THIS MOSQUE IS 
HOW OLD 
IT WAS BUILT IN THE EARLY EIGHTH CENTURY 
IT'S IN PERSIAN ON RIGHT SIDE AND ON LEFT SIDE IT IS IN ARABIC 
MEANS JUST ENTER THIS MOSQUE WITH THE BELIEF 
WITH BELIEF CAN WE GO IN YE S. P. LEA SE 
WOW 
IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL VERY SIMPLE 
IN THE SOVIET PERIOD THE MOSQUE WAS TURNED INTO A PRISON AND LATER A MUSEUM 
TODAY IT THRIVES AS A PLACE OF WORSHIP FOR SUFI SUNNI AND SHIA MUSLIMS ALIKE 
THIS IS SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL 
PRAYING TOGETHER PRAYING TOGETHER IT IS A VERY PEACEFUL CITY 
KHAN IS NOT ONLY A CLAN LEADER BUT A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND A CONNOISSEUR OF DAGHESTANI RUGS' 
MOST OF THEM LOCAL AND YOU SEE THAT THIS IS A SOVIET PERIOD PRAYER RUG WHICH IS 
THEY STILL MAKE THEM IN THE SOVIET PERIOD 
YEAH BUT THIS IS IT WAS BANNED RELIGION WAS BANNED IN THE SOVIET PERIOD HERE WASN'T IT 
ANYWAY I THINK THAT THIS RUG IS SOMETHING LIKE NINETEEN FORTIES OR NINETEEN FIFTIES 
AND HERE WE HAVE NATURAL DYES BY THE WAY NATURAL DYES 
AND MIXED WITH CHEMICAL DYES THIS IS CHEMICAL THIS IS NATURAL 
AS YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
PLASTIC FLOWERS AND NATURAL FLOWERS YOU CAN SEE IT STRAIGHT AWAY CAN YOU IF YOU ARE EXPERT 
SINCE SETTING OFF FROM MURMANSK IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE 
I'VE TRAVELLED FOUR THOUSAND MILES 
BY ROAD AND RAIL AND SOMETIMES BY BOAT AS WELL 
BUT I'M STILL NOT HALFWAY TO MY FINAL DESTINATION 
RUSSIA IS VERY BIG 
IN PROSPECT THIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE LARGEST COUNTRY 
IN THE WORLD WAS QUITE DAUNTING 
BUT I FEEL NOW I UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT RUSSIA 
ITS DIVERSITY AND ITS RICHNESS AND I'VE MET SOME INCREDIBLE PEOPLE 
WARM FRIENDLY AND WELCOMING 
AND THAT PLUS MORE VODKA THAN I EVER THOUGHT I'D CONSUME 
FUELS MY ENTHUSIASM FOR THE NEXT STAGE
