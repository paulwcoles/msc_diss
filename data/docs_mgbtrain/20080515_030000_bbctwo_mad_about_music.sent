ECHO CITY DIDN'T START OUT AS A BAND 
IT STARTED OUT AS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BUILD 
OR DESIGN AND BUILD UNUSUAL MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
WE STARTED OUT MAKING MOST THINGS FROM BITS OF JUNK 
FROM THINGS WE COULD PICK UP WHICH WERE CHEAP AND SOUNDED GOOD 
ECHO CITY IS ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MUSIC WHEN THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE IT OTHERWISE 
BY MAKING USE OF STRANGE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SO PEOPLE DON'T THINK 
THIS ISN'T A PIANO I CAN'T PLAY THIS 
THEY WALK UP TO ONE OF OUR INSTRUMENTS AND THINK I CAN EXPLORE THIS I CAN PLAY THIS HOW I WANT TO 
DRUMS HAVE DIFFERENT PITCHES' 
THEY'VE ALSO GOT THE SURFACE OF THE DRUM IS MADE OF A HARD RIDGE 
WHICH THEY WOULD NORMALLY STAND ON 
AND THEN A SOFTER AREA IN THE MIDDLE WHICH HAS LESS THICKNESS 
AND THAT PRODUCES THE BASIC SOUND 
AND THE THICKER EDGE PRODUCES A MORE RINGING SOUND 
IT RESONATES FROM THE SIDE OF THE DRUM 
IN A PIECE LIKE THE HORSE YOU MIGHT HAVE A PASSAGE THAT GOES 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
THE FIRST THING THAT WE DO IS TO WORK ON THE HORSE RHYTHM ITSELF 
THAT'S THE MAIN RHYTHM THAT WE THROW ALL THE OTHER BREAKS INTO 
THE NEXT PART IS A BREAK WHICH WE CALL ONE WHICH GOES 
YOU PUT THAT INTO THE HORSE THAT GOES 
TWO USES THE OUTSIDE AND THE INSIDE OF THE DRUM AND GOES 
THIS IS THE HORSE 
THEN THERE'S ONE WHICH GOES 
THEN THERE'S TWO 
AND THEN THERE'S THREE WHICH IS BUILT UP OF THREE PARTS THE HORSE 
PLAYED ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE DRUM 
THEN WHAT WE CALL GARY GLITTER WHICH GOES 
AND WHAT WE CALL SANDY NELSON WHICH GOES LIKE THIS 
SO THOSE ARE ALL THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE PIECE 
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING WITH TWO PEOPLE CLAPPING 
AND I WANTED TO DEVELOP THE PATTERN 
I FINALLY CAME UP WITH 
THE OTHER PLAYER PLAYS THAT WITH YOU 
AND THEN SKIPS A BEAT AND IS ONE BEAT AHEAD OF YOU THEN TWO BEATS 
YOU KEEP SLIDING OVER A BEAT FROM UNISON UNTIL YOU'RE BACK IN UNISON 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THI I. IS 
IT HIT ME ALL OF A SUDDEN I JUST GOT UP GOT ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OUT 
AND JUST STARTED RECORDING I STARTED OFF WITH A BASS LINE 
AND WENT FROM THERE TO PERCUSSION DRUMS KEYBOARDS 
AND IT JUST BUILT UP AND BUILT UP UNTIL I FINALLY FINISHED THE SONG 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THI I. IS 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THI I. IS 
NO ONE COULD EVER HAVE WHAT WE HAVE 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS 
THE BEST WAY TO START OFF A RHYTHM TRACK IS TO GET A GOOD SOLID RHYTHM 
SO WHATEVER TEMPO IT'S GOING TO BE YOU HAVE TO SORT THAT OUT FIRST OFF 
SO I PUT IN A VERY BASIC CLICK TRACK 
THIS IS THE SAME TEMPO AS THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS 
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE A VERY SIMPLE RHYTHM 
IT'S JUST THERE SO EVERYTHING THAT YOU PUT ON THE TOP JUST FITS 
O. K. SO WE GOT A CLICK TRACK NOW 
AND I WANT TO PUT DOWN THE BASS LINE 
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THE MAIN VIBE OF THE TUNE IS COMING FROM 
SO FROM THAT NOW I NEED TO PUT A BEAT WITH THE B. LINE 
BASS LINE AND DRUMS GO TOGETHER 
THIS DRUM BEAT 
THE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT GOES WITH THE BASS LINE I'VE JUST PLAYED 
SO WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT DRUMS AND BASS OR BASS AND DRUMS 
THE TWO SIT TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY'RE THE BASIS OF YOUR RHYTHM TRACK 
THEY MAKE IT KICK 
WHEN YOU'VE FINISHED MAKING UP ALL THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS 
YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT PATTERNS BUT THEY MAKE ONE BIG RHYTHM SECTION 
I LIKE TO KEEP MY RHYTHM SYNCOPATED WHICH MEANS I LIKE LOTS OF OFF BEATS 
SO I LIKE 
STICK WITH ME AND WE'LL MAKE HISTORY 
AN EXCLUSIVE PAIR IN LOVE WE WILL BE 
AND THERE'S NO NO NO NO 
SUBSTITUTION 
FOR WHAT WE HAVE NO OTHERS CAN HAVE 
BULERIA IS A PARTICULAR FORM OF FLAMENCO A STYLE OF FLAMENCO 
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING FORMS OF FLAMENCO IT'S VERY RHYTHMICAL 
IT'S QUITE A COMPLEX RHYTHM 
THE WHOLE RHYTHMIC SECTION IS MADE UP OF TWELVE BEATS 
THE PALMAS THE HAND CLAPPING IN FLAMENCO IS INTERESTING 
BECAUSE IT HELPS CREATE THE RHYTHM FOR THE DANCERS AND THE SINGING 
IT HELPS CARRY THE FLOW OF THE RHYTHM 
A VERY BASIC PALMAS IN BULERIA WOULD BE 
EVERY HAND CLAP WOULD BE ON THE BEAT 
AND THEN WE HAVE CONTRA PALMAS WHICH IS CLAPPING IN BETWEEN THE RHYTHMS 
A LOT OF FLAMENCO IS BASED ON RHYTHMICAL STRUCTURES 
AND THE MUSIC TENDS TO SPEED UP AND THERE'S A BREAK 
THEN IT SLOWS DOWN AGAIN AND STARTS SLOWLY BUILDING UP TO A CRESCENDO 
THE THING ABOUT INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC IS IT'S AN ORAL TRADITION 
IT'S PASSED DOWN OVER THE YEARS AND IT'S NOT WRITTEN 
SO YOU HAVE TO MEMORISE YOU HAVE TO MEMORISE A LOT OF SPOKEN PATTERNS 
TAL IS THE IDEA OF A RHYTHMIC CYCLE WHICH IS REPEATED A GIVEN NUMBER OF TIMES 
SO YOU HAVE VARIOUS TALS 
YOU CAN HAVE ONE IN SIXTEEN BEATS OR YOU CAN HAVE ONE IN TEN BEATS 
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT TALS BUT THE ONE MOST COMMONLY USED IS TINTAL 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT 
NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT 
NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN 
I LIKE WORKING WITH A SEQUENCER IT'S LIKE A READY MADE ORCHESTRA 
FOR INSTANCE THE TAMPURA SOUND 
IS LIKE THAT AND THAT'S AN A 
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT GRADUALLY YOU CAN BUILD UP THE PIECE 
SO THAT I CAN RECORD VARIOUS SOUNDS INTO THE SEQUENCER 
FOR INSTANCE THE FLUTE 
SO I PLAY THE RHYTHMIC PHRASE INTO THE PIECE LIKE THIS 
AND IF I PLAY THAT BACK 
SO YOU CAN HEAR THINGS ARE BUILDING UP 
AND OF COURSE THEN I CAN ADD IN RHYTHMIC INSTRUMENTS LIKE THE CONGAS AND THE TRIANGLE 
AND THEN I CAN ADD IN THE CONGA AS WELL 
THOSE TWO TOGETHER COME OUT LIKE THIS 
O. K. AND THEN WHAT I CAN FINALLY DO IS PUT ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER 
WHAT YOU'VE JUST HEARD WAS A SECTION FROM A RHYTHMIC CYCLE CALLED JAHPTAL 
AND THE KATHAK DANCE IS A PIECE THAT I'VE WRITTEN IN JAHPTAL 
WHICH IS A TEN BEAT CYCLE 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT 
NINE TEN 
DO RE MI FA 
SOL LA TI DO 
TI LA SOL 
FA MI RE DO 
THE BLUES 
IT MIGHT NOT LIKE AN AUTHENTIC BLUES 
THE PUB BLUES 
BUT IT IS 
BECAUSE IT CONSISTS OF THE THREE CHORD TRICK 
WHICH IS USED IN MOST MUSICS AROUND TODAY WHICH ARE 
YOU'VE GOT THE F. WHICH IS THE THE FOURTH 
AND YOU'VE GOT THE G. WHICH IS THE V. 
THE BLUES SCALE IS TERMED THE PENTATONIC SCALE 
WHICH CONSISTS OF FIVE NOTES 
BASICALLY ALL THE BLUES IS BASED AROUND THOSE FIVE NOTES 
JUST PLAYED IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS 
IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO START IN ANY PARTICULAR ORDER 
YOU CAN START GOING THE OTHER WAY 
OR START ON A DIFFERENT NOTE 
OR I CAN START HERE 
OR I CAN DO SOME LEAPS 
OR USING BENDING TO ACCESS ME TO THE OTHER NOTES OF THE PENTATONIC SCALE 
SO STRINGING THAT ALL TOGETHER WE'VE GOT A BLUES 
AND START AGAIN 
THAT WAS A TWELVE BAR BLUES AND THAT WAS THE CYCLE TWELVE BARS 
IN C. MAJOR OR ANY KEY FOR THAT MATTER YOU CAN HAVE WHAT I CALL BOXES 
IN THESE BOXES YOU'RE JUST PLAYING THE SAME FIVE NOTES 
BUT MAYBE IT'LL SOUND HIGHER IN THE SECOND BOX 
SO IN THE FIRST BOX SAY BOX A I PLAYED A NORMAL PENTATONIC SCALE 
IN BOX B. I'LL BE PLAYING THOSE SAME FIVE NOTES BUT IN A DIFFERENT ORDER 
AND IT'LL SOUND HIGHER 
BECAUSE I'M STARTING ON MAYBE THE SECOND OCTAVE OF THE SCALE 
THEN YOU GO TO BOX C. WHICH IS TAKING IT ANOTHER STAGE EVEN HIGHER STILL 
USING A COMBINATION OF ALL THREE ENABLES ONE TO IMPROVISE 
THIS INSTRUMENT HAS GOT FIVE TUBES TO GIVE ME A SCALE LIKE THIS 
IT'S CALLED A BATPHONE BECAUSE YOU USE A BAT TO PLAY IT 
AND IF YOU USE DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF TUBE YOU PRODUCE DIFFERENT NOTES 
I'VE GOT A LONG TUBE HERE A PIECE OF GAS MAIN 
AND AS I HIT IT 
IT PRODUCES A RUSH OF AIR DOWN THE TUBE 
AND IT'S A LONG WAVELENGTH SO IT PRODUCES A LOW NOTE 
O. K. NOW I'VE GOT A SHORTER PIECE HERE 
WHICH 
WILL PRODUCE A SHORT WAVE AS I HIT THE TUBE 
SO IF I JUST PLAY BETWEEN THE TWO HERE 
IN GO CATCH A HORSE 
I USE THE WHOLE RANGE OF THE INSTRUMENT I GO 
IN FLAMENCO THERE ARE THREE KEYS 
THERE'S A MAJOR KEY A MINOR KEY 
AND WHAT'S KNOWN AS A PHRYGIAN KEY OR PHRYGIAN MODE 
THE PHRYGIAN MODE IS VERY SIMPLE 
IF YOU TAKE A SCALE OF C. 
WHICH HAS NO SHARPS OR FLATS 
PLAYING UP TO THE C. ABOVE AN OCTAVE HIGHER 
NOW IF WE START ON THE THIRD NOTE OF THAT SCALE WHICH IS 
E. C. D. E. 
AND WE PLAY FROM E. IN THE KEY OF C. WITH NO SHARPS OR FLATS 
AND UP TO THE NEXT E. AN OCTAVE HIGHER IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS 
AND ALREADY IT STARTS TO HAVE THAT ARABIC FLAVOUR AND THAT'S HOW A PHRYGIAN KEY IS MADE UP 
IF YOU TAKE ANY MAJOR SCALE AND START ON THE THIRD NOTE OF THAT SCALE AND PLAY UP AN OCTAVE 
THAT IS A PHRYGIAN KEY AND IT GIVES IT AN ARABIC SOUND 
AND BY ADDING ONE OR TWO MORE NOTES IT MAKES IT SOUND EVEN MORE ARABIC 
THE RAGA IS A MELODY BASED ON SCALE 
WHICH FOLLOWS CERTAIN RULES AND 
INDIAN MUSIC BASICALLY IS IMPROVISATORY IN NATURE 
FOR EXAMPLE THE RAGA I PLAY BASANT MUKARI 
THIS IS THE BASIC STRUCTURE 
NOW ON THIS STRUCTURE I'M IMPROVISING 
JAPANESE MUSIC USUALLY USES FIVE NOTE SCALES 
SO IN YOUR SCALE THERE'S ONLY FIVE NOTES 
IN EUROPEAN MUSIC THERE'S USUALLY SEVEN NOTES IN A SCALE 
SO IN SOME WAYS IT'S A KIND OF LIMITED MUSIC 
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S NOT REALLY FELT AS A LIMITATION 
BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING A LOT OF OTHER THINGS IN THE MUSIC 
JAPANESE MUSIC BASICALLY USES TWO SCALES 
ONE OF THEM IS IN THE PIECE THAT I WAS PLAYING 
AND THIS USES A SEMITONE 
AND THEN A MAJOR THIRD 
THIS IS A VERY CHARACTERISTICALLY JAPANESE SCALE 
ANYTHING YOU WRITE IN THAT SCALE WILL COME OUT SOUNDING JAPANESE 
THE OTHER SCALE THEY USE 
HAS A MINOR THIRD AND THEN A TONE 
THIS IS MUCH MORE OF A UNIVERSAL FOLK SCALE 
YOU FIND THIS SCALE IN IRISH MUSIC OR IN THE BLUES 
A LOT OF ROCK MUSIC USES IT 
IT'S A VERY COMMON SCALE ALL OVER THE WORLD 
AND UM 
IF I PLAY SOMETHING USING THAT SCALE 
I MEAN TO ME THAT ALMOST SOUNDS IRISH BUT IN FACT IT'S JAPANESE 
TRADITIONAL MUSIC IN GENERAL 
IT'S A VERY ORAL TRADITION OF LEARNING 
AND I LEARNED MOST OF MY TUNES BY EAR 
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY PLAY THE PIPES OR THE FIDDLE 
ME DAD SINGS ME MUM PLAYS THE CONCERTINA ME GRANDDAD PLAYED FIDDLE AND ACCORDION 
SO I LEARNED THAT WAY REALLY WHICH I THINK IS MUCH HEALTHIER 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T JUST LEARN FROM THE DOTS WRITTEN DOWN 
YOU LEARN THE FEELING AND THE PASSION BEHIND THE MUSIC 
THE MAIN INSTRUMENT THAT I PLAY IS THE NORTHUMBRIAN PIPES 
WHICH ARE A MEMBER OF THE BAGPIPE FAMILY BUT THEY DIFFER FROM THE BETTER KNOWN SCOTTISH PIPES 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T BLOW INTO THEM THE AIR COMES FROM THE BELLOWS 
STRAPPED ROUND YOUR WAIST 
AND THROUGH THIS PIPE INTO THIS PIPE 
AND THEN INTO THE AIR RESERVOIR 
AND THEN THE AIR GOES FROM THE BAG INTO THE DRONES THESE BITS HERE 
WHICH PROVIDE THE BACKGROUND HARMONY 
PRODUCES DRONE NOTE THAT GOES ON ALL THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING 
THIS BIT HERE THE CHANTER PLAYS THE MELODY OVER THE BACKGROUND DRONES 
SO WE'VE GOT THE DRONES TUNED IN THE TWO F.'S AN OCTAVE APART 
AND THE FIFTH WHICH IS THE C. IN THE MIDDLE 
I LIKE THIS ASPECT OF HAVING THE FIFTH SO YOU CAN USE IT OPEN AND THE MAJOR AND MINOR 
AND A LOT OF MY TUNES UTILISE THIS FREEDOM 
OF JUST FLUCTUATING BETWEEN MAJOR AND MINOR 
FOR INSTANCE IN HALIBUT YOU CAN PLAY 
WHICH HAS A MAJOR THIRD OR 
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER I PLAY IT WITH THAT MAJOR THIRD IN 
OR WITH THE MINOR 
THE SOUND OF THE NORTHUMBRIAN PIPES IS TO ME A VERY BLEAK SOUND 
QUITE HAUNTING AND WISTFUL AT TIMES 
WHICH ECHOES THE LANDSCAPE AND THE HISTORY OF NORTHUMBERLAND 
HOMELESS HOMELESS 
MOONLIGHT SLEEPING ON A MIDNIGHT LAKE 
ALL ALONE IN THE COLD HOMELESS HOMELESS 
UNDER THE MOON MOONLIGHT SLEEPING ON A MIDNIGHT LAKE 
AI AYEE HOMELESS AI AYEE HOMELESS 
MOONLIGHT SLEEPING ON A MIDNIGHT LAKE 
HOMELESS HOMELESS 
ALONE MOONLIGHT SLEEPING ON A MIDNIGHT LAKE 
IF I WAS TO TAKE A TUNE THAT YOU ALL KNOW LIKE NEIGHBOURS FOR INSTANCE 
IT'S A BASIC WE ALL KNOW THE NEIGHBOURS THEME TUNE 
JUST FOR INSTANCE LIKE THAT 
THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF HARMONISING IT 
I JUST USED VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD CHORDS THERE 
JAZZ CHORDS 
WHICH ARE ALSO THE BASIC CHORDS BUT WITH LITTLE NOTES ADDED IN THEM TO MAKE THEM SOUND MORE JAZZY 
THAT'S A STRAIGHT CHORD 
OR THE ROOT POSITION CHORD 
THEN YOU ADD THE SIXTH OF THE CHORD 
WHICH MAKES IT JAZZY 
SO THAT COULD BE USED IN 
THAT SORT OF STYLE BUT THAT'S ALL BASED ON THE JAZZ TRADITION 
OTHER COMPOSERS WOULD USE MAYBE A MORE BAROQUE BASED TRADITION 
SO SOMETHING MORE CONVENTIONAL 
O. K. HYMN TUNES IN CHURCH ALSO USE VERY TRADITIONAL HARMONY 
O. K. THERE ARE SO MANY VARIANTS OF CHORDS AND THINGS 
TO CREATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TEXTURES 
MESSIAEN'S STYLE WAS VERY UNIQUE 
IN THAT HE ALWAYS USED THE HARMONIC TEXTURE TO CREATE A DIFFERENT KIND OF SOUND HE WANTED 
FOR INSTANCE YOU'LL FIND THE SOUNDS IN THIS PIECE THAT I PLAYED TODAY 
IS NOT WHAT WE'D CALL NORMAL IN A WAY 
BUT QUITE DISSONANT FOR INSTANCE THIS PASSAGE 
AGAIN THE COLOURS ARE ALL VERY DIFFERENT AND MIXED TOGETHER 
HE USES WHAT WE'D CALL POLYTONALITY 
WHICH MEANS DIFFERENT LAYERS OF SOUNDS USED AT THE SAME TIME 
FAIR PHYLLIS IS ABOUT A SHEPHERDESS STUCK UP THE MOUNTAINSIDE 
LOST FROM ALL THE OTHER SHEPHERDS AND HER LOVER AMYNTAS 
THEY'RE ALL LOOKING FOR HER AMYNTAS FINDS HER 
AND HE GETS IN SOME FAIRLY SERIOUS KISSING AT THE END 
FAIR PHYLLIS I SAW SITTING ALL ALONE 
FEEDING HER FLOCK NEAR TO THE MOUNTAIN SIDE 
FAIR PHYLLIS I SAW SITTING ALL ALONE 
FEEDING HER FLOCK NEAR TO THE MOUNTAIN SIDE 
THE SHEPHERDS KNEW NOT WHITHER SHE WAS GONE 
BUT AFTER HER LOVER BUT AFTER HER LOVER AMYNTAS HIED 
ONE OF THE FIRST TECHNIQUES WE HEAR IS POLYPHONY 
WHERE YOU HAVE VOICES SOUNDING AT THE SAME TIME BUT MOVING AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND AT DIFFERENT PITCHES 
THIS WORKS NICELY WITH THE SHEPHERDS KNEW NOT WHITHER SHE HAD GONE 
THE SHEPHERDS KNEW NOT THE SHEPHERDS KNEW NOT WHITHER SHE WAS GONE 
BUT AFTER HER LOVER BUT AFTER HER LOVER AMYNTAS HIED 
UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN 
UP AND DOWN HE WANDERED 
THE SHEPHERDS GO RUNNING AFTER EACH OTHER TO TRY AND FIND AMYNTAS 
AND YOU ACTUALLY GET A MUSICAL CHASE IN THE MUSIC 
WE ALL SING THE SAME WORDS AND THE SAME MUSIC 
BUT JUST VERY CLOSE IN ON EACH OTHER TO GET THIS STRETTA IT'S CALLED MUSICAL CHASE 
UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN 
HE WANDERED 
UP AND DOWN HE WANDERED UP AND DOWN HE WANDERED 
HE WANDERED 
WHILST SHE WAS MISSING 
WHEN HE FOUND HER O. THEN THEY FELL A KISSING 
O. THEN THEY FELL A KISSING A KISSING 
O. THEN THEY FELL A KISSING 
OOH OOH OOH 
IT'S JUST ANOTHER ONE OF MY BIG IDEAS 
OOH OOH OOH 
IT'S JUST ANOTHER STEP IN MY NON CAREER 
OOH OOH OOH 
IT'S JUST ANOTHER ONE OF MY BIG IDEAS 
ANOTHER ONE OF MY BIG IDEAS WAS A SONG THAT KEV AND I WROTE 
AND LIKE EVERY SONG WE DO IT'S AN INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE TWO PEOPLE 
AT ANY GIVEN TIME SOMEBODY HAS THE ROLE TO INTERJECT AND SAY WHOA HOLD EVERYTHING 
OR THE OTHER GUY CAN SAY NO I WANT TO TAKE IT FURTHER 
SO WE SET UP THE DRUM MACHINE WITH A FAIRLY DANCEY GROOVE 
WHICH WE THOUGHT HAD A NICE POP ASPECT 
BUT THE LYRIC ANOTHER ONE OF MY BIG IDEAS HAD A SADNESS TO IT 
SO WE WANTED TO ADD SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST A JOKE REALLY TO IT 
SO WHAT WE DID WAS ADD SOME CHORDS 
I ALWAYS USE STRINGS FOR THE FIRST SOUND 
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY WARM SOUND WITH LOTS OF TEXTURE IN THERE 
THAT CAN GIVE YOU MANY IDEAS FOR MELODY WRITING YOU'LL HEAR THAT IMMEDIATELY WHEN I PLAY 
IT'S VERY SAD IT'S VERY RICH AND IT'S VERY SYMPHONIC 
AND IT CAN GIVE YOU HUNDREDS OF IDEAS FOR MELODIES FOR THE TUNE 
I'VE HIT ON A SECRET CURE 
TO WASH MY BLUES AWAY 
BASICALLY WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH A CHORD LIKE THIS 
IS THAT BY ADDING NOTES YOU CAN GIVE IT A DIFFERENT TEXTURE A SADDER FEEL OR A BLUESIER FEEL 
SO IN IT'S BASIC FORM IT WOULD SOUND LIKE THIS 
IT'S WHAT I CALL THE BORING BASIC RUN THROUGH 
NOW BY ADDING NOTES WITH THE A ADD THIS NOTE UP HERE 
YOU CAN HEAR IT IN THE CHORD SUDDENLY IT TAKES ON A MUCH RICHER TEXTURE 
WITH THE SECOND WE ADD A DIFFERENT SOUND HERE 
WE KEEP THE THIRD AND FOURTH THE SAME YOU DON'T WANT TOO RICH A RECIPE 
ALL TOGETHER YOU GET THIS 
MAYBE I'LL FIND SOMEONE 
TO SHARE MY MILKY WAY 
BUT I ALWAYS SEEM TO WAKE UP 
FEELIN' SICK AND BRUISED INSIDE AGAIN 
CAN YOU PUT THE DRUMS UP FOR A SECOND 
I WAS LOOKING FOR WAYS OF ACTUALLY GETTING IN 
THAT WAS GIVING ME A TOTALLY DIFFERENT IDEA 
THEN I DECIDED I DIDN'T LIKE THE SECOND NOTE VERY MUCH SO I CHANGED THAT TO 
AN F. SHARP 
THAT WAS BETTER BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THE RHYTHM SOUNDING SO BROKEN 
SO IT EVOLVED INTO THIS 
ANOTHER ONE OF MY VINTAGE YEARS 
OOH OOH OOH 
I TOOK ANOTHER SWING FROM THE CHANDELIER 
BY THIS TIME KEVIN WAS ALREADY CONJURING UP SOME GUITAR TEXTURES 
PAN OVER TO THERE 
WELL WE TRIED A FEW POWER CHORDS 
BUT WE FOUND REALLY THAT WHAT THE CHORDS THEMSELVES NEEDED 
WAS NOT A POWER GUITAR TREATMENT SO MUCH AS MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF CRYING COUNTERPOINT TYPE THING 
GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND PLAY ME THE CHORDS AND I'LL SHOW YOU 
WE GOT SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT SAD AND CRYING QUITE SUBLIMINAL 
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS WAS SETTING US OFF 
IN PURSUIT OF NEW TEXTURES AS WELL IN THE OVERALL ARRANGEMENT 
OOH OOH OOH 
IT'S JUST ANOTHER ONE OF MY BIG IDEAS 
BIG IDEAS 
JUST ANOTHER 
JUST ANOTHER 
ANOTHER ONE OF MY BIG IDEAS 
JUST ANOTHER 
JUST ANOTHER 
ANNE MARIE AND BEVERLEY LEAD OUT WITH THE FIRST LINE 
SANDRA YOU JOIN WITH THE ALTO ON THE SECOND LINE 
YOU JOIN ON THE THIRD LINE AND I'LL JOIN ON THE FOURTH 
SO SOPRANOS ALTO TENOR BASS 
NKOSI SIKELEL'I AFRICA 
MALUPHAKANYISW'UPHONDO IWAYO 
YIZWA IMITHANDAZO YETHU 
NKOSI SIKELELA 
IN A CAPPELLA MUSIC 
BECAUSE THERE IS NO MUSICAL ACCOMPANIMENT BY INSTRUMENTS 
THE VOICES HAVE TO TAKE ON THE ROLE OF A PIANO OR A GUITAR 
OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT THAT WOULD NORMALLY ACCOMPANY A VOCAL 
AND SO IN A CAPPELLA THE CHORDS ARE ORGANISED VERY SIMILARLY 
AS THEY WOULD BE IN TERMS OF PIANO OR GUITAR 
NKOSI SIKELEL'I AFRICA 
MALUPHAKANYISW'UPHONDO IWAYO 
YIZWA IMITHANDAZO YETHU 
NKOSI SIKELELA 
THINA LUSAPHO IWAYO 
THERE ARE VERY STRONG BASS AND TENOR LINES 
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT SOPRANO OR ALTO ARE NOT IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE YOU CAN HEAR THEY'RE MISSING IF THEY'RE NOT THERE 
BUT IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT 
THAT THE LOWER HARMONIES IN BLACK MUSIC COME THROUGH STRONGER 
NKOSI SIKELEL'I AFRICA

CHOOSING THE RIGHT INSTRUMENTS TO CONVEY WHAT YOU WANT 
IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT 
I HAD A BIT OF TROUBLE BECAUSE I KNEW I WANTED TO WRITE A JAZZY PIECE 
BUT I ALSO WANTED TO HAVE CLASSICAL INSTRUMENTS PLAYING THIS 
AND IT WAS JUST TRYING TO THINK WHAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT BALANCE THE RIGHT FLAVOUR 
AND CHOOSING INSTRUMENTS TO GIVE ME THE MOST VARIETY 
MODERN DISSONANT PIECE 
WHEN I THINK OF TIMBRE I ALWAYS THINK OF COLOUR 
AND TEXTURE 
AND HOW INSTRUMENTS RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER 
FOR INSTANCE THERE'S ONE SECTION WHERE THE WIND PLAYS A SLOW CHORDAL PASSAGE 
AND THEN THAT IS TAKEN OVER BY THE STRINGS PLAYING HARMONICS 
MAKING A VERY ETHEREAL SOUND 
FOR A SECOND YOU THINK IT'S THE WIND INSTRUMENT PLAYING 
I LOVE THE USE OF DISSONANCE IN A PIECE 
IT'S LIKE COOKING USING PEPPER AND SALT TO SPICE THINGS UP 
DISSONANT CHORDS CAN OFTEN GIVE A REAL CRUNCH HERE'S A CRUNCHY CHORD 
AS OPPOSED TO A SMOOTHER CONSTANT CHORD LIKE THIS 
NOW I'M VERY INFLUENCED BY JAZZ 
AND I LOVE THE WAY IN JAZZ YOU GET THESE TWO SORTS OF CHORDS LYING SIDE BY SIDE 
STRAVINSKY WAS A COMPOSER THAT USED CONSTANT CHORDS ALONGSIDE DISSONANT CHORDS 
JUST TO GIVE NEW COLOUR 
AND IN THE SECTION THAT I SCORED FOR WIND IN THIS PIECE 
I'LL PLAY THE CRUNCHY CHORDS A BIT LOUDER 
SO YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY SIT ALONGSIDE SMOOTHER CONSTANT CHORDS 
IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO HAVE GOOD CHORDS THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING 
IT'S HOW YOU SHAPE THEM WHETHER THEY HAVE ACCENTS OR NOT 
WHETHER THEY'RE PLAYED LOUDLY OR SOFTLY IN ONE SECTION IN THIS PIECE 
I SPENT AGES AND AGES GETTING ALL THESE LOVELY CHORDS LIKE THIS 
BUT THEN WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM THIS IS HOW IT TURNED OUT 
IT'S NOT THE QUESTION OF HAVING A MELODY 
AND THEN THINKING WHAT CHORD WILL FIT WITH THAT 
IT'S GOT TO WORK PART AND PARCEL 
THE RHYTHM THE MELODY THE HARMONY MUST WORK TOGETHER AS A WHOLE 
TO MAKE THE PIECE SOUND GOOD HOPEFULLY 
GET LOST ADAM 
NORMALLY AFTER I'VE WATCHED THE FILM A FEW TIMES 
AND GOT TO GRIPS WITH WHAT'S GOING ON ON SCREEN I'LL SIT DOWN AT THE PIANO 
AND I'LL TRY THINGS OUT UNTIL SOMETHING STICKS UNTIL SOMETHING MAKES ME FEEL 
THAT I'M BRINGING THE PICTURES ALIVE OR I'M CONTRIBUTING SOMETHING TO IT 
SO AT THE BEGINNING IT'S ALL VERY FULL OF MOVEMENT AND ACTION 
SO CONSEQUENTLY THE MUSIC HAS TO DO THE SAME THING 
SO THE VERY FIRST GERM OF MUSIC THAT YOU HEAR IS THIS BASS AND PIANO THAT SOUNDS A BIT LIKE THIS 
AND IT'S GOT THAT AGGRESSION AND FIERINESS 
WHICH I FELT WOULD WORK WITH THE VERY FIRST SCENE OF PICTURES 
I PUT A CLICK TRACK DOWN WHICH KEEPS ME IN TIME IT'S JUST BASICALLY A METRONOME 
CL L. L. C. K. T R. AC K. O N. 
AND ONWARDS LIKE THAT BUT IT BASICALLY CARRIES ME THROUGH TO THE NEXT SEQUENCE 
NOW IF I PLAYED SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR EXAMPLE 
YOU KNOW SOMETHING VERY BUSY AND FULL OF MOVEMENT IT WOULD BE TOTALLY WRONG WITH THE PICTURE 
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THERE'S A VERY SLOW CAMERA MOVING AND IT NEEDS TO BE SLOW 
YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE IT OR OVER EMBELLISH WHAT YOU WRITE SO 
WITH THE KNIFE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS QUITE EERIE AND SINISTER SO I USED THIS CHORD 
IF I'D HAVE USED SOMETHING LIKE HIGHER CHORD 
HIGH BOUNCY CHORD 
BUT THIS LOWER CHORD 
JUST SOUNDS MENACING AND RIGHT 
ONE FOR YOU 
THE INSTRUMENTATION AND THE COMPOSITION TEND TO COME HAND IN HAND 
WHEN YOU THINK OF A TUNE IT'S REALLY BEST TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO BE PLAYING THE TUNE 
FOR THIS PIECE I THOUGHT OF SAX IMMEDIATELY FOR THE OPENING 
I'VE JUST GOT A SAX SOUND ON HERE SAX ON 
IT'S GOT THAT GRITTINESS IT'S GOT THAT AGGRESSION WHICH I WANTED 
I CHOSE GUITAR BECAUSE I WANTED SOMETHING FOR THE WOMAN 
THAT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPRESSIVE AND EERIE AND I THOUGHT GUITAR IS WONDERFUL FOR THOSE KIND OF THINGS 
BECAUSE IT IS SO EXPRESSIVE AND YOU CAN GET A LOT OF MOVEMENT WITHIN THE NOTE OF THE GUITAR 
THAT JUST LEAVES IT UNRESOLVED IF I'D DONE SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT FINISHES IT OFF THAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT WE'RE RESOLVED 
WE'VE COME TO THE END OF THE JOURNEY AND WHAT'S HAPPENED HAS HAPPENED 
SO IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY RESOLVE BACK INTO THE KEY THAT YOU STARTED IN OR THE KEY THAT YOU ARRIVE AT 
IT JUST GIVES A FEELING THAT SOMETHING SINISTER'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
YOU'RE LEAVING IT UP IN THE AIR BY DOING 
WE START ON A MASSIVE LANDSCAPE BUT IT'S A SIXTY F. T. SHIRT AND IT STARTS TO RAIN STAINS DOWN ON THIS SHIRT 
A CLOWN IS DODGING THE STAINS AS IF HE'S GOING THROUGH THE RAIN HE BUMPS INTO A VERY LARGE PACK 
WHICH HE HAS TO SHRINK DOWN BECAUSE IT'S A CONCENTRATED PRODUCT 
AND THEN BECAUSE THIS IS NOT JUST CONCENTRATED IT'S SUPER CONCENTRATED IT GOES AGAIN 
IT GOES AGAIN SO WHAT I WANT IS A SENSE OF IT GOING ZZZZ 
AND THEN A REALLY HARD URGH 
AS IF IT'S HARD TO DO THAT LAST BIT AS IF YOU REALLY HAVE HAD TO CONCENTRATE IT HERE 
MUSIC IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HELPS TO COMMUNICATE THE MESSAGE 
THAT'S THE SOLE JOB OF THE MUSIC 
BUT IT CAN ALSO RELAX AND STIMULATE THE VIEWER AT THE TIME YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL THEM SOMETHING 
AT THE SAME TIME TELEVISION COMMERCIALS AREN'T ALWAYS WATCHED THEY'RE OVERHEARD 
IF YOU'RE IN THE KITCHEN AND THIS COMMERCIAL COMES ON 
IF YOU'VE NOTICED THAT THE MUSIC LINKS STRONGLY WITH THE IMAGE YOU WILL GET SOME OF THE SELL AS WELL 
SO MUSIC HAS AN IMPORTANT RECOGNITION FACTOR ALSO 
SO WE START I THINK WITH SOMETHING WHICH IS VERY PLEASANT 
AND SPACY AND PASTORAL AND RELAXED 
AND THEN WHEN THE STAINS START TO RAIN DOWN IT'S JUST A SHOWER THERE'S NOTHING HEAVY ABOUT THAT 
NOT THUNDERY OR ANYTHING AND THE CLOWN THEME COMES IN AS HE DODGES THROUGH IT 
WITH THE TIME CONSTRAINTS INVOLVED IN WRITING FOR COMMERCIALS 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH VERY QUICKLY THE MOOD IT HAS TO BE INSTANT 
FIRST HE WANTS US TO ESTABLISH THIS DRIP DRIP THING AT THE BEGINNING 
THEN WE WANT TO BE PASTORAL BECAUSE THE SHIRT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE A HILLSIDE 
AND THEN HE BUMPS INTO THE PACK 
AND HE SUDDENLY BECOMES HIS OLD JOLLY SELF 
SO IT THE SPACE OF FIVE SECONDS WE'VE GONE THROUGH TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT MOODS 
CLIPPITY CLOP EFFECT 
CYMBALS 
I TRY AND CONSTRUCT THE MUSIC 
SO THAT THE EFFECTS FALL ON THE BEAT SO THAT THEY DON'T SOUND LIKE THEY'RE TOTALLY SEPARATE FROM THE MUSIC 
THEY WOULD COME IN A LITTLE HOLE IN THE TUNE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO THEY DON'T SOUND LIKE THEY'VE COME OUT OF NOWHERE 
YOU CAN ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THEM AS PART OF THE MUSICAL STRUCTURE 
I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THESE BALLOON THINGS GOING UPWARDS 
IN ORDER TO TRY AND DEMONSTRATE TO OUR CLIENTS 
WHAT WE ENVISAGE AS A SOUND THAT'S GOING TO BE ON THE FINAL FILM 
WE USE A LOT OF SAMPLED NOISES AND SYNTHESISED NOISES' 
THAT'S SMASHING GREAT I THINK IT DOES WORK THERE'S A LOAD OF STUFF MISSING 
I WAS GOING TO PUT A BIG TOM TOM ON 
LIKE A THUD YEAH 
SORT OF DRYISH BUT DEEP THUD YEAH EXCELLENT 
RED WINE TEA STRAWBERRY 
WHEN IT'S RAINING STAINS 
LOOK FOR A WASHING POWDER 
TOM TOM THAT'S NOT JUST CONCENTRATED BUT 
SUPER CONCENTRATED 
WITH CLIPPITY CLOP EFFECT 
NEW SURF MICRO PLUS IT'S THE BEST SURF YET 
SQUARING UP TO REALLY STUBBORN STAINS 
WHEN SURF'S AS GOOD AS THIS 
COINS JANGLE WHY PAY MORE 
I'M A MAN WITH COMMON SENSE 
AND I'M LOOKING FOR BIG FUN 
SO DON'T GIVE ME NONE OF THAT 
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M COMING FROM 
THIS IS AN ATARI COMPUTER 
AND IT'S RUNNING A MUSIC SEQUENCER PACKAGE 
THIS IS CALLED NOTATOR WRITTEN UP HERE UM 
BASICALLY IT'S LIKE A MULTI TRACK 
IT'S LIKE YOUR LITTLE STUDIO RIGHT HERE 
IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GENERATE THE MUSIC 
BUT IT TELLS EVERYTHING WHAT TO DO 
SOME BASIC TAPE RECORDER FUNCTIONS HERE START REWIND STOP RECORD 
YOU CAN PUT ALL THE TRACKS HERE LIKE YOUR BASS TRACK KEYBOARD TRACK 
IN THAT SECTION THERE BASICALLY YOU TAKE THEM AND YOU ARRANGE THEM 
YOU PUT THEM ALL INTO AN ARRANGEMENT MODE HERE WHICH IS BASICALLY TO STRUCTURE THE SONG 
PUT IT INTO LIKE A RIFF THERE THEN PUT YOUR VERSE HALFWAY IN THE MIDDLE GO BACK TO THE RIFF AGAIN 
YOU CAN MOVE EVERYTHING AROUND IN THAT PAGE THERE THAT'S THE COMPUTER 
THE KEYBOARD HERE 
A YAMAHA KEYBOARD 
STRING SOUNDS AND CHORDS SYNTH SOUNDS YOU CAN GET OFF HERE 
I USE BASS SOUNDS ON HERE AS WELL 
NOW YOU CAN'T RECORD ANALOGUE SOUNDS INTO THE COMPUTER 
YOU CAN ONLY RECORD DIGITAL SOUNDS 
DIGITAL WHEN I SAY DIGITAL I MEAN KEYBOARDS 
I MEAN THE DRUM MACHINE 
TO RECORD ANYTHING LIKE VOICE SAXOPHONE GUITAR I RECORD ON THAT 
THIS IS AN EIGHT TRACK MACHINE HERE 
THIS WILL RECORD ALL OF YOUR ANALOGUE SOUNDS 
WHEN I SAY ANALOGUE I MEAN VOICE SAXOPHONE 
ANYTHING THAT YOU PUT IN VIA THIS MICROPHONE HERE I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A DEMONSTRATION 
YEAH I LIKE TO GAMBLE 
WHEN YOU HAVE EVERYTHING READY 
TO PUT IN YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO MASTER IT OR PUT IT ONTO TAPE 
EVERYTHING GOES THROUGH THIS DESK HERE NOW THIS IS THE MIXING DESK 
AS YOU CAN SEE THESE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT CHANNELS 
YOU CAN JUST TAKE SOME CHANNELS OUT OF THE KEYBOARD OUT OF THE DRUM MACHINE 
AND THEY ALL GO INTO THE MIXING DESK 
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN SEND TO THE SPEAKERS TO YOUR MACHINE 
TO ANY RECORDER THAT YOU WANT TO RECORD TO 
DON'T YOU BE AFRAID 
IF YOU WANT TO I WILL BE YOUR FRIEND 
COS YOU ARE ONE AND I AM EQUAL 
SO LET'S GET IT ON 
LET'S GET 'EM ON 
IF YOU WANT TO 
THE WAY I WROTE THIS SONG BLACK PLANETS 
IT WAS STARTED WITH THE DRUM PATTERN THAT'S WHAT I HEARD FIRST 
I'M GOING TO ENTER THE DRUM PATTERN NOW ONTO THIS COMPUTER HERE IT GOES 
I'LL PUT IT ON CHANNEL ONE BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR ANYTHING TO CONVERSE IN AN ORDERLY FASHION 
EVERYTHING SHOULD BE ON A DIFFERENT CHANNEL SO YOU DON'T CREATE CHAOS AND MAYHEM 
I'VE PUT MY CLICK THERE IT'LL PLAY A CLICK 
SO EVERYTHING IN TIME O. K. AND BASICALLY YOU JUST GO INTO RECORD 
THAT'S HOW I PUT IT IN 
NOW THAT WAS FOUR BARS WHICH IS SIXTEEN BEATS I'M GONNA LOOP THAT ON SIXTEEN HERE SO IT LOOPS IN CYCLES 
ALSO I'M GOING TO PUT A QUANTISE ON THERE A GROOVE QUANTISE 
I'M GONNA PUT IT SO EVERYTHING IS HITTING IT NOTHING IT TOO LOOSE I'VE GOT A GROOVE QUANTISE THERE 
SO IT GIVES MORE OF A FUNKY KIND OF FEEL TO IT 
I'LL PUT IN THE HI HATS AND THE UNDERGROUND SOUNDS 
I'M GONNA LOOP THAT THE SAME AMOUNT SIXTEEN 
THE SAME QUANTISE ON QUANTISE B. 
I CAN GO INTO DIFFERENT TRACKS HERE NOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY NAME ALL OF THESE THINGS 
SO FOR INSTANCE I'LL CALL THIS YOUR HI HATS 
JUST SO THERE'S A REFERENCE THE NEXT THING I DID WAS I PUT ON A BASS 
I'M GOING TO CHANNEL FIVE ON THE COMPUTER AND CHANNEL FIVE 
ON THE KEYBOARD 
NO MATTER WHAT I WRITE ON THE COMPUTER I'M WRITING IT FOR MUSICIANS TO PLAY IT YEAH 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT INTERACTION 
YEAH I LIKE TO GAMBLE 
SOMETIMES WIN MOST TIMES LOSE 
BLACK PLANETS DON'T YOU BE AFRAID 
IF YOU WANT TO I WILL BE YOUR FRIEND 
COS YOU ARE ONE AND I AM EQUAL 
SO LET'S GET IT ON 
LET'S GET 'EM ON 
IF YOU WANT TO 
I'LL TAKE YOU ON MY MOTHERSHIP 
IF YOU WANT TO 
WE CAN RISE IN PEACE TO THE END 
OH I'LL TAKE YOU PLACES 
WHERE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE 
BLACK PLANETS DON'T YOU BE AFRAID 
IF YOU WANT TO 
I WILL BE YOUR FRIEND 
COS YOU ARE ONE 
AND I AM EQUAL SO LET'S GET IT ON 
LET'S GET 'EM ON 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS 
THE LYRICS WITH THIS SONG 
ARE PURELY INSPIRED BY THE MUSIC 
IT TOOK ME ALL DAY 
FROM ELEVEN TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE AFTERNOON AND I JUST STOPPED 
COS I GOT TO SUCH A POINT WHERE I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE 
AND I JUST WENT OUT FOR A BIT AND THEN I CAME BACK IN AGAIN 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I JUST HAD THE MELODY IN MY HEAD 
AND JUST FROM THE MELODY I STARTED TO MAKE UP WORDS WHILE I'M SINGING 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS 
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SING ALONG WITH IT 
B. A. DOO DOO DOO DOO B. A. DUM DUM 
B. A. DOO DOO DUM DUM B. A. DUM DUM 
B. A. DUM DUM DUM DUM B. A. DUM DUM DUM 
B. A. DOO DOO DUM DUM B. A. DUM DUM DUM B. A. DOO DOO 
SO IT JUST ENHANCES THE BASS AND THE DRUMS 
THEN AFTER THAT I CAN ADD ON STRINGS OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER I WANT TO ADD 
BECAUSE IT'S JUST UNLIMITED AS TO HOW MANY INSTRUMENTS YOU CAN PUT ON THE TOP 
IT COULD BE PERCUSSION 
IT COULD BE PIANO IT COULD BE VIBES IT COULD BE STRINGS 
THIS WAS LYING AROUND AND I SAID 
WELL LET ME SEE WHAT THIS SOUNDS LIKE WITH THE TRACK AND IT JUST ADDS A. 
IT'S JUST ANOTHER RHYTHM THING JUST TO ENHANCE THAT JUST TO ADD FLAVOUR TO THE WHOLE PIECE OF MUSIC 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS WITH PERCUSSION EFFECT 
WHEN I WROTE THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS I RECORDED IT ON AN EIGHT TRACK TAPE RECORDER MACHINE 
WHICH IS LIKE THIS ONE HERE AND BASICALLY WHAT IT LETS YOU DO IS 
RECORD THE DRUMS THE BASS WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO 
BUT YOU CAN PUT IT ON SEPARATE CHANNELS SO YOU CAN MIX YOU KNOW PUTTING IN CUES AND STUFF 
SO WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS REALLY COMPLICATED IS BASICALLY SEPARATE CHANNELS 
WHERE YOU CAN CHANGE THE FREQUENCIES WITH THE BASS AND TREBLE 
AND THESE BUTTONS HERE YOU CAN PUT ECHOES OR EFFECTS ON THESE CHANNELS 
TO GIVE YOU A BETTER SOUND OR WHATEVER YOU WANT 
THIS ONE HERE JUST PUTS IT TO LEFT OR RIGHT 
SO YOU MIGHT HAVE THREE BACKING VOCALS 
YOU PUT ONE THERE ONE THERE AND ONE THERE SO SPREAD THEM OUT 
AND THIS ONE IS JUST BASICALLY THE LEVEL OF THE WHOLE OF THAT TRACK 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS 
NO ONE COULD EVER HAVE 
WHAT WE HAVE 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS 
THIS IS YOUR THIS IS YOUR LIFE 
HEY HEY HEY 
THIS IS YOUR 
THIS IS YOUR LIFE 
THIS IS YOUR LIFE 
THIS IS YOUR LIFE 
WE TEND TO WORK SEPARATELY TO START WITH 
I MIGHT COME UP WITH SOME CHORDS OR 
A DRUMBEAT OR JUST A ROUGH IDEA 
AND THEN CAROLINE WILL SEE IF SHE'S GOT SOME IDEAS LYRICALLY OR MUSICALLY ON TOP OF THAT 
IDEAS CAN COME FROM ALL SORTS OF SOURCES 
READING BOOKS IS MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE 
I PINCH LOTS OF IDEAS FROM BOOKS 
WRITING THINGS DOWN KEEPING NOTES 
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES 
YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS YOUR 
THIS IS YOUR LIFE 
IT'S BASICALLY THREE SECTIONS WHICH ARE THE VERSE BRIDGE AND CHORUS 
WHICH WE USE THROUGHOUT THE SONG BUT WE CHANGE USING A FEW TRICKS TO MAKE IT SOUND MORE INTERESTING 
WE JUST STARTED IT OFF WITH A DRUM LOOP AND A BASS AND SOME CHORDS ON THE PIANO WHICH WE'LL SHOW YOU 
IT STARTS WITH THE DRUMS 
OUT OF TIME DRUM LOOP 
NOW THE BASS 
THAT'S THE BASIS FOR THE WHOLE SONG AND THE VERSE 
THE CHORUS IS VERY SIMPLE IT'S JUST THE TITLE OF THE SONG 
THOSE LINES REPEATED THIS IS YOUR THIS IS YOUR LIFE 
WHICH IS VERY HANDY BECAUSE PEOPLE REMEMBER IT AND CATCH ON TO IT 
THIS IS REAL THIS IS REAL LIFE 
THE NEXT BIT'S THE BRIDGE 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
GOING INTO THE CHORUS 
THE BRIDGE IS THE PART IN BETWEEN THE VERSE AND THE CHORUS 
AND BASICALLY IT'S JUST FOR VARIATION BECAUSE IF IT WAS ONLY VERSE CHORUS VERSE CHORUS 
IT WOULD BECOME QUITE MONOTONOUS 
SO IT'S USUALLY JUST A CHANGE OF CHORDS THAT USUALLY LIFTS IT 
FROM A SERIOUS POINT OF VIEW TRYING TO PUT A MELODY ON TOP OF A BACKING TRACK 
THE LESS COMPLICATED IT IS THE BETTER 
SO THEREFORE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A RHYTHM TRACK AND A BASS LINE 
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SING A MELODY OVER THE TOP OF THAT 
THAT'S MUCH EASIER THAN SOMETHING THAT HAS A LOT OF COMPLICATED KEYBOARD LINES 
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST LESS SPACE FOR YOU 
IF YOU'RE GONNA PUT KEYBOARD LINES ON AFTERWARDS FOR GUITAR PARTS 
IT'S EASIER TO WORK ROUND A VOCAL IT'S GOOD TO IMITATE THE VOCAL LINE SOMETIMES AND USE BITS OF IT 
COS THEN THE WHOLE THING FLOWS TOGETHER 
SO USUALLY WE'LL LEAVE THAT BIT TILL AFTER WE'VE ESTABLISHED 
WHAT THE VOCAL WILL BE 
THIS IS YOUR LIFE 
THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS YOUR LIFE 
THIS IS YOUR LIFE 
THIS IS YOUR LIFE THIS IS YOUR LIFE 
USUALLY WHEN I'M STARTING TO WRITE A PIECE 
OFTEN IT'S THE COLOUR OR THE FEEL OR THE KEY 
OF THE THING AND I USUALLY START BY MESSING ABOUT AT THE PIANO HAVING A BIT OF FUN 
AND THEN JUST SLOWLY SIFTING THROUGH IDEAS 
EACH PIECE HAS ITS OWN FORM THAT GROWS ORGANICALLY 
THERE'S ONE SECTION IN THIS PIECE WHERE I'VE USED A QUITE JAZZY SORT OF JAZZY STYLE 
BY USING THE WALKING BASS BUT ACTUALLY IT'S PLAYING SOMETHING QUITE ATONAL LET ME JUST SHOW YOU 
NOW THE RHYTHM'S QUITE CLEAR BUT THE ACTUAL NOTES 
YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHERE YOU ARE WHAT KEY YOU'RE IN 
AND THAT CAN BE OFTEN A USEFUL WAY OF BUILDING TENSION OR CREATING A DIFFERENT SORT OF FEELING 
UM THAN SAY MAYBE JUST USING A STRAIGHT MAJOR OR MINOR SCALE 
THIS PIECE USES LOTS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT SORTS OF RHYTHM IT USES LOTS OF SYNCOPATION 
THAT MEANS THE MUSIC COMES OFF THE BEAT SO IN OTHER WORDS INSTEAD OF JUST BEING STRAIGHT 
IT GIVES THAT JAGGED SORT OF EDGE WHICH I LIKE AND THAT'S MY EMPHASIS FROM JAZZ 
THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF LATIN TYPE RHYTHMS 
FOR INSTANCE IN ONE LITTLE SECTION PLAYED BY THE STRINGS AND THE OBOE 
THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE MAYHEM SECTION WHICH IS TOWARDS THE END OF THE PIECE 
WHERE EVERYBODY'S JUST PLAYING IN THEIR OWN WORLD ALL AT THE SAME TIME THAT WAS SO EXCITING TO WRITE 
IT'S MEANT TO SOUND LIKE MAYHEM LOTS OF PEOPLE MIGHT HEAR IT AND THINK 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE BUT I WANTED THAT SORT OF CHAOS FEELING 
JAZZ IS NOT THE ONLY MUSIC TO HAVE IMPROVISATION WITH 
IN CLASSICAL MUSIC THERE'S A THING CALLED A CADENZA WHERE AT THE END OF A PIECE 
THE FLAUTIST OR THE VIOLINIST WOULD PLAY A SHORT IMPROVISATION AND THEN COME BACK TO THE CLASSICAL PIECE 
IMPROVISATION 
JULIAN THE PIANO PLAYER TAKES THE BULK OF THE SOLO 
AND I TAKE THE BULK OF THE SOLO BECAUSE I'M JUST A GREEDY PERSON UM 
BUT THE OTHER PLAYERS ARE IMPROVISING AS WELL 
CHERYL OUR DRUMMER IS NOT PLAYING A REGULAR BEAT SHE'S IMPROVISING CONSTANTLY 
IT'S NOT LIKE PLAYING A FUNK TUNE OR A POP TUNE WHERE YOU'RE ASKED TO PLAY A REGULAR PATTERN 
IN JAZZ MUSIC THE DRUMMER IS CONSTANTLY IMPROVISING 
EVERY SECOND THAT PERSON IS MAKING SOMETHING UP WHICH'LL COMPLEMENT EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE BAND 
ALSO THE GUITARIST IS PLAYING SOME RHYTHM 
BUT HIS RHYTHM IS NOT A STATIC THING IT'S AN IMPROVISED RHYTHM 
IMPROVISATION 
AFRICAN MUSIC IS BASED AROUND IMPROVISATION 
SOMETIMES FIVE OR SIX DRUMMERS WOULD GET TOGETHER AND IMPROVISE A RHYTHM AS A COLLECTIVE 
AND THAT'S BEEN TRANSFERRED INTO WHAT YOU SEE NOW 
INSTEAD OF HAVING FIVE DRUMS YOU GET A PIANO BASS DRUMS AND A SAXOPHONE PLAYER 
WHEN YOU PLAY CLASSICAL MUSIC YOU'VE GOT TO PLAY WHAT YOU READ 
WHEN YOU PLAY JAZZ MUSIC WE START WHERE THE PAPER ENDS 
SO YOU TAKE THE PAPER AWAY AND YOU PLAY WHAT YOU FEEL SO IF YOU KNOW THREE NOTES ON AN INSTRUMENT 
YOU CAN PLAY THAT ANY WAY YOU FEEL LIKE IT AND THAT IS THE BASIS OF SPONTANEOUS IMPROVISATION 
THIS IS A STORY ABOUT TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE FINDING OUT WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE IT IN MUSIC AND FILM 
YO IF YOU LOVE TO KICK IT LET ME HEAR YOU SAY BOO 
BOO LET ME HEAR YOU SAY BOO BOO BOO LET ME HEAR YOU SAY 
AND ACTION AND ACTION 
IF ONLY I CAN GET THROUGH THIS 
IF ONLY I CAN GET THROUGH THIS 
IF ONLY I CAN GET THROUGH I JUST GOTTA GET 
I JUST GOTTA GET 
IF ONLY I CAN GET I JUST GOTTA GET THROUGH THIS 
I JUST GOTTA GET THROUGH THIS 
I GOTTA GET THROUGH THIS I GOTTA GET THROUGH THIS 
I GOTTA MAKE IT GOTTA MAKE IT GOTTA MAKE IT THROUGH 
I'M GONNA GET THROUGH THIS 
MIKEL MEDLEY IS A GARAGE AND DRUM'N'BASS M. C. FROM GLOUCESTER HE WORKS FOR THE DISTRICT COUNCIL 
AT NIGHT HE PERFORMS IN LOCAL CLUBS UNDER THE NAME OF M. C. DREAD 
AN M. C. IS THERE TO COMPLEMENT THE MUSIC 
HE'S THERE TO HYPE UP THE CROWD AND BE CHATTIN' LYRICS OVER A D. J. 
A LOT OF IT IS IMPROVISATION YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TUNE MIGHT COME IN NEXT 
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES A GOOD M. C. 
YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHEN NOT TO BE CHATTIN' 
WHEN NOT TO BE MESSIN' UP THE MIX 
I THINK IT'S JUST PEOPLE REALLY EXPRESSING THEIR VIEWS 
COS THE MUSIC HAS GOT SO MUCH ENERGY IN IT 
YO LADIES I WANNA SEE YOU GO CRAZY 
I'VE BEEN CHATTING FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS OR SO NOW 
AND JUST BEEN PROMOTING MY OWN PARTIES 
I'M WELL KNOWN AROUND BRISTOL AND CARDIFF AS WELL AS GLOUCESTER 
MOST PEOPLE KNOW ME AS M. C. DREAD 
I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT MY FRIENDS WERE LAUGHING AT ME 
COS MY FIRST LYRICS WERE 
I'M A RASTA I COME FROM GLOUCESTER I'M SCARY LIKE A TARANTULA 
AT SCHOOL PEOPLE CALLED ME DREADLOCKS AND DREAD 
AND I'M A RASTA 
AND IT IS PART OF MY RELIGION 
TO BE GROWING THE LOCKS 
I'M A VEGETARIAN WHEN I'M CHATTIN' I LIKE TO I ALWAYS SAY I'M A VEGETARIAN 
AND TALK ABOUT EMPEROR SELASSIE THAT'S ONE OF MY MAIN LYRICS 
I WAS ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY MUSIC MY MUM PLAYING LOADS OF OLD TIME REGGAE 
AND MY DAD PLAYING RAGGA MUSIC AND HEAVY DUTY TUNES 
AND HE HAD HIS OWN SOUND AND THAT I GOT MUSIC CONSTANTLY POUNDED INTO ME 
HIM LEARN EVERYTHING OFF OF ME 
COS I WAS DOING IT FIRST 
WHEN HE COME ALONG WHEN HE'S LISTENING 
AND I TAKE HIM OUT AND YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON THIS NEW MUSIC WHAT'S COMING IN NOW WHAT YOU DO 
IT'S GOOD REALLY GOOD I'M GETTING INTO IT GET TO UNDERSTAND IT 
MY DAD STILL LIKE CHATS PATOIS' 
SIMI YA UP PUT YOU ON A STRETCHER DEALING WITH THE DANGER 
SIMI YA IS LIKE SEE I'M HERE PUT YOU ON A STRETCHER 
AND I GO INTO THE ENGLISH SAYING DEALING WITH THE DANGER 
LIKE PRECISE DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN I JUST SWITCH IT ROUND 
TRAMPLE CROSS FIDDEM SAMPLE SHOW THEM WE'RE WELL AND WE'RE ABLE 
WE ARE THE BOYS IN THE CRADLE SO GET READY FOR THE INCREDIBLE 
I COLLECT PHRASES USUALLY I'M WALKING DOWN THE ROAD AND SOMETHING MIGHT POP IN MY HEAD 
MOST OF THE TIME I'VE GOT POST IT NOTES ON ME BUT MOST RECENTLY I WRITE THEM IN MY TEXT MESSAGES 
U. K. GARAGE IS LIKE OUR MUSIC THAT IS LIKE OURS FOR US 
IT'S A WAY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS' 
IN HIS SPARE TIME MIKEL PASSES ON HIS SKILLS AT MCING WORKSHOPS 
AT THE LOCAL YOUTH CLUB EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE AN M. C. 
IF YOU LISTEN TO THE LYRICS THEY'RE EITHER BRAGGING OR BOASTING OR THEY'RE INTERESTING RHYMES' 
THIS IS D. J. ASH 
REST OF THESE ARE PARTNER SENSATION ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MAN STRONG THIS IS TRILLA 
YOU'RE THE YOUNGEST INNIT YEAH 
THIS IS HIS BROTHER NITRYL I WORK WITH THEIR OLDER BROTHER A LOT MARKY B. DYNAMIC IMPACT 
AND THAT'S ANACONDA 
I'M ABOUT FOURTEEN I'VE BEEN MCING SINCE I WAS TEN 
IT'S A GOOD WAY TO EXPRESS YOURSELF AND AT THE TOP IT PAYS WELL 
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT AND WE'RE DIFFERENT 
WORSHIP B. B. C. LEARNING ZONE 
THERE'S LOADS AND LOADS OF M. C.'S THERE'S ALWAYS COMPETITION 
WHEN YOU FACE YOUR ENEMY AIM FOR HIS WEAKEST POINT 
YOU'VE GOT ONE CHANCE TO CHAT ON THE MIC 
IT'S JUST HAVING THAT CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS SOON AS YOU GET ON THERE 
IT'S LIKE WORKING UP A GOOD REPUTATION 
SOME OF THE M. C.'S ARE REHEARSED 
SOME PEOPLE FREESTYLE WHICH MEANS THE LYRICS ARE COMING OFF THEIR HEAD AND THEY RHYME AS THEY GO ALONG 
NEXT STEP FOR MIKEL AND HIS CREW IN THEIR BID TO GET NOTICED IS TO WRITE AND RECORD THEIR OWN TUNES 
THE TUNE WE'VE DONE IS DEEP AND IT'S UNDERGROUND IT'S DARK AND HYPER 
BUST THIS MIC A THOUSAND TIMES OVER 
STEP INTO THE FUTURE 
M. C. DREAD BAD BOY ENTERTAINER ORIGINAL MR. BUFFALO SOLDIER 
THE BEATS FOR THE TUNES ARE PROVIDED BY PRODUCER MNP 
MNP'S MY GOOD MATE AND I'VE KNOWN HIM ALMOST ALL MY LIFE 
WE'RE BOTH PISCES AND HE'S THE ONE WHO PRODUCES MOST OF MY BEATS 
HE'S CALLED MNP COS HIS NAME'S MALIKAI NEGUS PATERSON 
BUT IT ALSO STANDS FOR MAD NO PROFESSOR OR 
MAD NO PRODUCER 
ANYONE CAN MAKE MUSIC ALL YOU NEED'S A COMPUTER 
A SET MIXER SAMPLES INSTRUMENTS THROW IT ONTO THE COMPUTER YOU CAN MAKE A SONG 
I MAKE BEATS I CAN GO DOWN TO A SHOP BUY A SAMPLE PACK STICK IT ON MY COMPUTER DOWNLOAD THEM 
AND PUT THEM INTO A PACKAGE LIKE FRUITY LOOPS ANYONE CAN DO IT 
THAT SOUNDS HEAVY 
DREAD AND MNP TAKE SOME OF THEIR TUNES TO A COMMUNITY RECORDING STUDIO IN CARDIFF 
THEY WANT A MORE COMMERCIAL SOUND USING THE R'N'B VOCALS OF D. J. ASH 
AND FEMALE BACKING SINGERS THE DAINTY SHATTAS 
ASH WILL START WITH THE FIRST VERSE THEN MY VERSE COMES IN AFTER THAT THEN THE GIRLS WILL SING THE CHORUS 
THEN YOU WITH YOUR NEXT VERSE 
I USED TO BE IN A CHOIR AT SCHOOL THEN I GOT INTO WRITING SONGS AND DOING STUFF WITH MIKEL AND THAT 
BUT R'N'B'S MY MUSIC COS YOU CAN EXPRESS YOURSELF IN THE MUSIC AND YOU CAN FEEL THE MUSIC

WE USED TO GO TO PARTIES AND THAT AND WHEN THE D. J.'S USED TO PLAY I SUNG ON THE MIC AND HE CHATTED 
AND WE THOUGHT WE'D DO A TUNE WITH EACH OTHER IT GOES IN TIME WITH THE BEAT SO IF WE SING THIS FIRST 
AND THEN STOP AND LISTEN TO IT AND THEN DO THAT BIT SEPARATELY BECAUSE WE CAN'T GO STRAIGHT INTO IT 
BECAUSE THERE'S NO BREATH THERE ALL RIGHT THEN WE DO THIS FIRST WHAT YOU WERE 
WHATEVER YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU JUST SAID BUT ON THE CHORUS 
WE EITHER DO THE LAST ONE ALTOGETHER OR LIKE DO ONE AND SEE WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE WITH YOU THREE 
AND THEN IF IT DON'T SOUND IF IT SOUNDS ALL RIGHT THEN I'LL COME IN AND DO IT ON A DIFFERENT OCTAVE 
AND IT'S LIKE YOU'RE HARMONISING MM HMM 
L. O. V. E. YOU GOT FOR ME 
YOU KNOW THAT I'M WANTING YOU YOU KNOW THAT I'M NEEDING YOU 
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO COME IN THERE 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE GIRLS HAVE BEEN IN THE STUDIO 
WHEN THE SONG IS FINISHED DREAD HAS PERSUADED A LOCAL YOUNG FILM MAKER 
TO SHOOT A MUSIC VIDEO TO ACCOMPANY IT 
MY NAME IS LUKE VAGNOLINI I'M SEVENTEEN AND I'VE BEEN MAKING FILMS SINCE I WAS ABOUT ELEVEN 
IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT KIND OF HAPPENED FROM A GENERAL INTEREST 
JUST THINKING HOW DO THEY DO THAT THINKING CAN I DO IT 
I DIDN'T REALISE YOU COULD DO IT YOURSELF I THOUGHT IT WAS 
ONLY PEOPLE WITH MONEY WHO COULD DO IT 
BUT I REALISED IT WAS POSSIBLE 
I JUST HAD A REALLY CHEAP CAMERA IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY AND I JUST WENT ABOUT AND IT WAS ON A CORD 
AND JUST CONNECTED TO A V. C. R. 
SOUND WAS PRETTY POOR PICTURE WAS PRETTY POOR 
BUT I USED LITTLE FIGURES AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND MADE FILMS LIKE THAT 
MAKING FILMS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN LEARN TO DO IT 
PEOPLE HAVE SAID ALL YOU DO IS POINT A CAMERA IT'S MORE YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE 
IT'S NOT UNTIL YOU MAKE A FILM THAT YOU REALISE HOW MUCH GOES INTO IT 
AND YOU REALISE THAT HOW MANY THINGS CAN GO WRONG 
THIS WAS MY FIRST DRAMA THE HARDEST FILM I'VE MADE 
I HAD FOUR PEOPLE ACTING IN IT AND NONE OF THEM TURNED UP APART FROM THE GIRL IN IT 
WHO'S AT THE END THE PERSON WHO WAS MEANT TO PLAY THE MAIN PART LET ME DOWN AT THE LAST MINUTE 
THE WAITER LET ME DOWN JUST AS WE WERE ABOUT TO FILM AND SO I HAD TO PLAY THE MAIN PART 
AND I HAD TO READ MY LINES FROM THE TABLE AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
HALF THE TIME I WAS GETTING IT WRONG EVEN THOUGH I'D WRITTEN IT 
I WAS ALSO TRYING TO DIRECT IT AND WE HAD TWO POWER CUTS 
IT WAS QUITE AN EVENT 
SON OF A PREACHER MAN BY DUSTY SPRINGFIELD 
THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME SIR 
NEVER ACTING BEFORE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I'D BE ABLE TO DO IT 
WHEN HIS DADDY WOULD VISIT HE'D COME ALONG 
WHEN THEY'D GATHER ROUND AND STARTED TALKING COUSIN BILLY WOULD TAKE ME WALKING 
THROUGH THE BACK YARD WE'D GO WALKING THEN HE'D LOOK INTO MY EYES 
LORD KNOWS TO MY SURPRISE 
WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T FREAK OUT 
WHAT THE WHAT'S THE MATTER YOU NEVER SEEN A TALKING ROLL BEFORE 
THE WAY I FINANCE MY FILMS IS PRETTY SIMPLE I JUST WASH UP 
AND IT'S ABOUT TWICE A WEEK FIFTY ODD IT'S JUST ABOUT SAVING UP 
AND I MANAGED TO GET MY CAMERA COMPUTERS THINGS LIKE THAT 
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF REALISING WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND IF YOU WANT TO GET A D. V. CAMERA 
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH ON OTHER THINGS 
THIS IS MY ROOM WHERE EVERYTHING HAPPENS I'VE GOT MY CAMERA 
AND I CAN DO D. V. FILMS WHICH MEANS I CAN PUT IT INTO MY COMPUTER 
GOT MYSELF A LITTLE MONITOR THERE TO VIEW THINGS AS I'M FILMING 
GOT MYSELF A DOLLY WHICH RUNS ON A TRACK 
LIGHT A SIMPLE THING THAT COST ABOUT FIVE POUNDS 
I'VE GOT THIS WHICH IS MEANT TO MOVE PLANTS BUT I'VE DECIDED TO USE IT TO RUN MY CAMERA ON 
TO GET LOW TRACKING SHOTS I STICK THE TRIPOD ON IT AND BASICALLY 
I'VE GOT CHEAP STUFF BUT CAN GET DECENT EFFECTS 
TO PREPARE FOR M. C. DREAD'S MUSIC VIDEO LUKE AND FRIEND KAI GO TO GLOUCESTER TO SCOUT FOR LOCATIONS 
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT DOING USING THIS PLACE FOR PART OF THE VIDEO YEAH 
YEAH I GUESS THAT'S WHAT THE BROTHERS WANT I DON'T MIND 
I DO WANT LOADS OF PEOPLE IN THERE 
SCAR TISSUE BY THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS 
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS LUKE HAS BEEN STUDYING FILM AND VIDEO AT CIRENCESTER COLLEGE 
HE ASKS THREE FELLOW STUDENTS TO HELP WITH DREAD'S VIDEO 
WHAT WE GOTTA DO IS MAKE A MUSIC VIDEO FOR A GUY CALLED M. C. DREAD 
AND HE SPEAKS OVER HE KIND OF RAPS OVER MUSIC 
AND ANOTHER BLOKE MIXES IT AND WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT SOME VIDEOS 
AND SEE WHAT WE THINK IS OVERUSED AND WHAT WE CAN MAYBE PLAY ON 
THEY'VE GOT THAT REALLY DISTORTED ANGLE 
THEY MESS AROUND WITH THE SPEED 
THEY'RE ALWAYS USING THAT FAST SLOW THING 
WE SHOULD HAVE HIM LIKE THEY DID THERE DOING THE SINGING AND THEN BREAK AWAY FROM HIM TO SOME ACTION 
I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD DO THE GANGSTER THING COS IT'S BEEN DONE SO MANY TIMES JUST WON'T WORK 
I THINK HIM HAVING A GOOD TIME THAN HAVING ALL THAT AGGRESSION 
WOULD KIND OF WORK BETTER WITH HIS CHARACTER 
DO IT LIKE THAT THE KEY IS TO EXPERIMENT I THINK 
YOU WANT TO GET THE CAMERA IN DIFFERENT PLACES 
A WEEK LATER DREAD'S FINISHED SONG ARRIVES IN LECHLADE 
ALL RIGHT KAI GOT THE C. D. COOL GIVE IT A LISTEN I THINK 
KNOCK ON THE DOOR 
IS IT L. O. V. E. THAT YOU GOT FOR ME I CAN GIVE YOU EVERYTHING 
JUST COME ON TO ME LADY 
SHOULD WE USE BASKETBALL 
A BASKETBALL GAME IT'S BETWEEN TWO GANGS BUT IN A WAY IT'S FRIENDLY 
INTRODUCE A CHARACTER HE COULD BE LOOKING AT THE BALL GAME HE COULD SAY THE GAME'S ABOUT TO START 
MAYBE A GIRL ON THE OTHER SIDE 
THE CHEERLEADERS ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEY MEET EACH OTHER 
MAYBE A REFEREE OF THE GAME COULD BE SINGING 
AND THE PERSON PLAYING THE GAME IS THE M. C. WHAT WILL YOU HAVE DREAD AS THE REFEREE THAT COULD BE COOL 
LIKE WILL SMITH AT THE BEGINNING OF FRESH PRINCE OF BEL AIR 
LUKE AND KAI TRAVEL TO A RECORDING STUDIO IN BRISTOL TO TALK THROUGH THEIR IDEAS WITH DREAD 
THE BASIC IDEA IS 
YOU START IN A CAFE AND IT COMES IN THE TOP BIT ON THE LEFT YEAH 
IT COMES IN WITH YOU WITH A FEW MATES 
AND THEN YOU GET A MESSAGE ON YOUR PHONE AND IT'S L. 
AND YOU KEEP ON GETTING YOU GET FOUR MESSAGES AND IT'S L. O. V. E. OH YEAH YEAH 
YOU'RE WONDERING WHO'S GIVING YOU THESE MESSAGES AND THERE'S THIS BASKETBALL GAME WHICH YOU JOIN IN 
AND YOU JOIN IN WITH THE GAME AFTER YOU'VE LOOKED AROUND FOR A BIT 
COS YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THESE MESSAGES 
LOTS OF EXTRAS GIVE THE FEELING THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WOULDN'T FEEL REAL 
IT ADDS TO THE VIDEO BUT IT ALSO CAUSES PROBLEMS BECAUSE CONTROLLING THAT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IS HARD 
AT THE END OF IT I WAS VERY VERY TIRED 
IT WAS SEVEN HOURS ALMOST SOLID I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT IT WAS I'VE GOT TO GET THIS DONE 
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE YOU ALWAYS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH I WAS PRETTY PLEASED WITH IT 
THE TEAM DID WELL 
I WANT TO BE A DIRECTOR IN THE FUTURE HOPEFULLY MAKING FEATURE FILMS FOR THE BIG SCREEN 
I'D LIKE TO BE PRETTY SUCCESSFUL I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO 
IT'S LIKE STUCK IN THE MIDDLE SO WHICHEVER CAREER PURSUES ME FIRST 
I'M GOING TO PUSH MYSELF TO WHATEVER LIMITS I CAN GO TO 
AFTER TEN DAYS' EDITING 
AND FOR A TOTAL COST OF THIRTY 
THE VIDEO IS FINISHED 
IS IT L. O. V. E. THAT YOU GOT FOR ME I CAN GIVE YOU EVERYTHING
