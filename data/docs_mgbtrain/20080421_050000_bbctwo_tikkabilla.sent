AW 
FRANCIS IS A HAPPY CAT 
BUT HE HAS A SECRET 
A SECRET EVEN FROM BEN OH 
FRANCIS IS A SCAREDY CAT 
OH 
FRANCIS IS AFRAID OF THE DARK 
AND MOST OF ALL 
HE IS AFRAID OF THE WHISPERY HISSING MONSTER 
HE HEARS IN THE BIG TREE IN THE GARDEN ON STORMY NIGHTS 
ONE EVENING BEN WAS LATE HOME 
AND FRANCIS WAS ALL ALONE 
THE WIND GOT LOUDER 
AND THE STORM GOT WILDER 
THE NIGHT GREW DARKER AND DARKER 
IT BECAME SO DARK 
THAT FRANCIS WASN'T SURE IF HIS EYES WERE OPEN OR CLOSED OH 
THE TREE WHOOSHED AND CRASHED OUTSIDE 
FRANCIS HEARD THE WHISPERY MONSTER HISSING 
SSSSSS THAT'S RIGHT 
SUDDENLY FRANCIS HAD A TERRIBLE THOUGHT 
WHAT IF THE MONSTER 
HAD CAPTURED BEN 
OH OH DEAR 
FRANCIS KNEW WHAT HE HAD TO DO 
HE PEEPED OUTSIDE AT THE DARK NIGHT 
HE CREPT INTO THE GARDEN 
HE CLIMBED THE BIG TREE TO RESCUE HIS FRIEND 
HE WAS SHAKING FROM THE TIP OF HIS WET NOSE 
TO THE END OF HIS FLUFFY TAIL 
AW 
BUT HE LOOKED DOWN AND HIS SCAREDY HEAD SPUN 
AND HIS SCAREDY LEGS WENT WOBBLY UNDER HIM OOH 
AND POOR FRANCIS WAS STUCK 
WITH SOMETHING HISSING BEHIND HIM 
I WONDER WHAT IT IS 
FRANCIS TURNED AND SAW TWO BRIGHT EYES GLARING AT HIM 
BUT HE STOOD UP READY TO FIGHT 
THE HISSY MONSTER 
LEAPT OUT OF THE SHADOWS 
AND FRANCIS SAW 
A CAT 
A BIG CAT 
A WILD CAT 
BUT A CAT LIKE HIM 
A CAT WITH A KIND FACE WHO LED FRANCIS GENTLY DOWN THE TREE 
SHOWING HIM WHERE TO PUT EACH STEP DOWN TO THE GROUND 
WHERE HE FOUND 
BEN

AND HIS VOICE AS FAMILIAR AS 
PILLOWS AND PYJAMAS
