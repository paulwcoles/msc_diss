WE'VE TWO TEAMS OF DANCERS WHO'LL BE SHAKING THEIR BOOTY FOR US 
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT THEY'RE MADE OF 
I LIKE THE WAY YOU MOVE 
MOST OF ALL 
I LIKE THE WAY YOU MOVE 
ON THE RED JIVING TEAM ARE BEN AND SHARON AND THE LINE DANCING BLUES ARE FAYE AND VALERIE 
WELCOME TO BARGAIN HUNT SO BEN HOW DID YOU ACTUALLY MEET SHARON 
I MET SHARON THREE YEARS AGO AT A JIVE WEEKEND AT SOUTHPORT 
WE MET ON THE DANCE FLOOR WAS IT ROMANTICO 
THE DANCE WAS DEFINITELY PASSIONATE 
YOU'RE VERY VERY GOOD YOU TEACH JIVE DON'T YOU 
WE DO WE TEACH JIVE TWICE A WEEK IN DERBY 
WE FORMED OUR OWN COMPANY EARLIER THIS YEAR CALLED DANCE D. BEAT 
HAVE YOU EVER COMPETED I COMPETED IN THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX U. K. AIR CHAMPIONSHIPS 
IT'S MY FIRST EVER COMPETITION 
I DIDN'T DO TOO WELL BUT IT'S THE TAKING PART THAT COUNTS 
LIKE BARGAIN HUNT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT WELL 
IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO MAKE A PROFIT TODAY THOUGH 
SHARON HAVE YOU ALWAYS DANCED JIVE 
ABSOLUTELY WELL I'VE ALWAYS DANCED ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY KNOW ME AS A DANCER 
I GOT INTO JIVE ABOUT FIVE SIX YEARS AGO 
AND HAVE YOU COMPETED I HAVE 
I WAS THE DIRTY DANCING CHAMPION 
DIRTY DANCING DIRTY DANCING YES TELL ME ABOUT THAT 
I ENTERED IT STRAIGHT OFF THE CUFF WITH A GUY THAT I HADN'T DANCED WITH BEFORE

YOU TEACH IT DO YOU YES YES 
YOU STARTED TEN YEARS AGO HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN TEACHING EIGHT AND A HALF YEARS 
DIDN'T TAKE YOU LONG TO GET GOING NO IT DIDN'T NO I JUST REALLY GOT ON WITH IT STRAIGHT AWAY 
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE LINE DANCING RATHER THAN ANY OTHER FORM 
WELL AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME I'D GOT A YOUNG FAMILY 
AND IT WAS EASIER FOR ME JUST TO GO OUT AND DANCE RATHER THAN TO HAVE TO GO WITH A PARTNER 
AND SO MY HUSBAND STOPPED AT HOME COS HE'S A FARMER ANYWAY 
SO HE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO GO OUT DANCING POOR OLD HUB 
HE CAN DANCE THOUGH IS HE PRETTY NIPPY YES YES HOW DID YOU GET TO KNOW VALERIE FAYE 
SOMEBODY RECOMMENDED VAL'S CLASS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I WANTED TO START LINE DANCING 
SO I WENT ALONG AND FOUND SHE'S GOT MY SORT OF SENSE OF HUMOUR 
AND WE HAD FUN AND WE OFTEN GO ON THESE WEEKENDS TO BLACKPOOL SOUTHPORT AND ALL OVER THE PLACE 
AND HOW DID YOU GET PARTICULARLY CLOSE WITH OLD VAL THEN 
WE HAD TO SHARE A ROOM IN 
PONTINS AT BLACKPOOL 
THE GLAMOUR OF IT 
WE WERE OUT TILL TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING DANCING AND DRINKING 
AND MAKING A NOISE ON THE WAY BACK TO THE CHALET BEHAVING LIKE A LOUT 
TEENAGERS I THINK 
YES IT WAS GOOD SO WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT ANTIQUES ANYTHING 
A LITTLE BIT WHAT I'VE WATCHED ON THE PROGRAMME 
I LIKE GOING ROUND ANTIQUE FAIRS AND I COLLECT NOVELTY EGG CUPS DO YOU

HEY BEN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DANCE IS IT COUNTRY DANCING 
DO YOU HAVE THIS STRAW ON THE FLOOR OR WHAT 
NO IT'S USUALLY A NICE WARM BALLROOM WITH A NICE POLISHED FLOOR 
AND IT'S NOT RAINING AND IT'S NOT WINDY HIYA 
HELLO I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU BUT I HAVE FOUND THIS WHICH I FIND REALLY QUITE INTERESTING 
IT'S VERY CHEAP AT THIRTY FIVE QUID I THOUGHT WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THIRTY FIVE THAT'S A VERY GOOD BUY HAVE YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT I HAVE 
I THINK THAT'S VERY GOOD ACTUALLY 
VERY ASTUTE OF YOU IT'S SO FUNCTIONAL 
YOU'VE GOT THE HANDLE THE GRIP AND YOU JUST SHOVEL 
THE FUEL WITH IT IT'S WONDERFUL 
AND WHAT I DO LIKE YOU SEE ALL THIS DECORATION HERE YEAH THAT'S WHAT ATTRACTED ME 
THIS CUT CARD AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE SAME SORT OF SKILL IN THIS DECORATION HERE 
AND EACH SECTION IS NUMBERED CAN YOU SEE 
SO YOU COULD HAVE A NUMBER SIXTEEN ON A COAL SCUTTLE NUMBER SIXTEEN HANDLE ON A BUCKET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
HAVE YOU FELT THE WEIGHT IT IS GOOD ISN'T IT 
YEAH THAT'S GOT SOME SUBSTANCE TO IT HASN'T IT 
YES DATE WISE I THINK IT'S LATE GEORGIAN COMING INTO VICTORIAN 
I WOULD SAY THIS PEOPLE DO NOT BUY COPPER AS ORNAMENTAL ITEMS TODAY BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE POLISHED 
IN THE MINIMALISTIC HOME THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THIS 
BUT THERE ARE STILL TRADITIONALISTS WHO WOULD 
THIRTY FIVE IS GOOD I CAN REMEMBER THESE GOING FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE AND NOW IT'S COME DOWN TO THIRTY FIVE GOSH 
LET'S HOPE WE CAN GET SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE AS OUR SECOND CHOICE COME ON THANK YOU 
DAVID'S IN A DECADENT MOOD 
WELL HE'S GOT THIRTY FIVE TO BEAT 
DANCE TO THE MUSIC 
HEY FAYE MARK 
WHAT DO YOU THINK TO THIS 
OH THAT'S RATHER NICE WHAT IS IT AN INKWELL 
LOOKS LIKE IT DOESN'T IT WHAT'S THE MONOGRAM ON THE TOP 
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE BELIEVE IT OR NOT M. S. MARK STACEY 
THAT'S A GOOD OMEN SO BASICALLY WHAT WE'VE GOT IS A DESK INK STAND WHICH IS REALLY QUITE HEAVY 
A CUT GLASS BASE HOBNAIL CUT WE CALL THIS AND THEN 
OPEN IT UP A NICE HEAVY SILVER TOP AND THERE'S YOUR INKWELL INSIDE 
WELL I LIKE IT I THINK IT'S QUITE A NICE QUALITY OBJECT AND I THINK IT 
WILL APPEAL TO A PRIVATE BUYER A GENTLEMAN WHO WANTS SOMETHING SITTING ON A DESK 
COS IT'S QUITE A MASCULINE LOOKING OBJECT GOOD GIFT FOR A MAN 
ABSOLUTELY FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY THEY'RE SO DIFFICULT TO BUY FOR 
WELL I'VE NEVER HAD THAT TROUBLE 
BUY ME ANYTHING AND I'LL ACCEPT IT THERE YOU GO 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT FAYE WELL I THINK IT WHAT'S THAT BIT OF 
IS THAT DAMAGED OR HAS IT JUST COME AWAY 
I WOULDN'T SAY DAMAGED I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED IS IT'S COME A BIT LOOSE 
SO I THINK WHAT SOMEBODY WOULD NEED IS JUST TO TAKE IT OFF THEN REGLUE IT BACK INTO PLACE 
BUT STRUCTURALLY I THINK IT'S FINE HONESTLY YOU KNOW 
WILL THAT AFFECT THE VALUE I DON'T THINK SO BUT WE HAVEN'T HEARD THE PRICE 
HOW MUCH IS IT VAL 
IT'S ONE HUNDRED SIXTY IT'S A BIT HIGH ISN'T IT 
YEAH I THINK YOU NEED TO GO AND FLUTTER THOSE EYELIDS I THINK SO 
YOU NEED TO GO AND SMILE SWEETLY BOTH OF YOU 
WE'LL DO OUR BEST GOOD LUCK SEE YOU LATER 
SEE YOU LATER 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY CAUSED A BIT OF A PEN AND INK BUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE SMELLED A LOT SWEETER 
WELL WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT KITSCH 
TRY THIS ON FOR ONE OF THE KITSCHEST THINGS YOU HAVE EVER SEEN 
HOW ABOUT THAT FOR A JAPANESE COLLECTABLE 
THE FIRST HINT THAT IT'S JAPANESE IS THE FACT THAT THE OUTER CASE 
IS LACQUERED AND WITHIN THE LACQUER YOU CAN SEE ALL THESE 
SPECKLEDY PIECES OF MOTHER OF PEARL WHICH IN EARLY JAPANESE LACQUER IS CALLED NASHI 
THE OTHER GOOD HINT THAT IT COMES FROM JAPAN IS THAT IT SAYS UNDERNEATH JAPAN WHICH IS HANDY 
TURN TO THE BACK IT'S GOT A LITTLE DRAWER 
IF I OPEN THE DRAWER THERE'S A COUPLE OF OLD FASHIONED BATTERIES 
WITH A LIGHT BULB SCREWED INTO THE BACK 
IT'S SO THAT AT NIGHT YOU COULD TURN THIS SIMULATED TELEVISION SET ON 
COS THAT'S WHAT IT IS IT'S TRYING TO BE A TELEVISION SET FROM NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE 
SO WHAT SHOULD WE WATCH TONIGHT DARLING 
HOW ABOUT STRICTLY COME DANCING 
THERE YOU GO HIM AND HER STANDING PERFORMING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BALLROOM FLOOR 
SHE WEARING A TULLE BALL GOWN AND HIM WEARING HIS TAILS 
IT HAS TO BE THE KITSCHEST THING IN THIS FAIR AND IT COULD BE YOURS FOR THIRTY 
GIVE US A TWIRL ANTHEA 
DANCE TO THE MUSIC DANCE TO THE MUSIC 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS DAVID ARE YOU INTO BOXES I LOVE BOXES 
REALLY ANYTHING TO PUT THINGS IN NOW BEFORE WE OPEN IT WHAT IS IT IT'S A BOX IT'S A BOX O. K. 
LOOK AT THAT ANGLE THERE 
AND THAT WILL TELL ME THAT IT IS A LAPTOP DESK A WRITING SLOPE 
EARLY LAPTOP ABSOLUTELY 
YEAH EARLY LAPTOP THE WOOD IS ROSEWOOD SO CALLED ROSEWOOD 
BECAUSE WHEN THE TREE WAS FIRST CUT THE SAP GAVE OFF THE ODOUR OF ROSES HENCE THE TERM ROSEWOOD 
RIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK INSIDE 
IT'S IN A BIT OF A DISMANTLED STATE 
HERE WE GO OH IT'S GOT THE ORIGINAL CORD THAT'S UNUSUAL 
THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT YOUR LETTERS YOU'D RECEIVED 
AND THEN ON HERE YOU WOULD WRITE YOUR LETTERS 
AND WHAT'S THAT FOR 
PUTTING YOUR STAMPS POSTAGE STAMPS 
NO COS IT'S BEFORE STAMPS 
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR NIBS 
SO IT'S AT AN ANGLE SO YOU COULD PULL THEM OUT AND HERE YOU'D LAY YOUR PEN 
WHEN YOU CAME TO WRITE YOU'D PRESS AND PULL THE PEN OUT THAT'S GOOD 
WHAT'S THAT FOR DAVID OH THAT'S WELL SPOTTED 
OH LOOK SECRET COMPARTMENT 
OH WONDERFUL 
I DO LIKE SECRETS THIS IS A NICE BOX

FORTY QUID GO FOR IT NOW

BEN BOXED AWAY AND HALVED THE ASKING PRICE TO TWENTY 
YOU CAN DO IT PUT YOUR BACK INTO IT 
I WILL I'M GONNA DO IT DO IT 
GONNA DO IT DO IT GONNA DO IT DO IT DO IT 
HEY GUYS LOOK AT THESE WHAT'S SHE FOUND 
THOSE ARE INTERESTING WHAT ARE THEY 
CURTAIN PULLBACKS FRENCH HOW DO THEY WORK THEN 
THAT FIXES TO THE WALL YES 
AND THEN THE CURTAINS COME DOWN LOOP IN AND HANG TO THE FLOOR 
COULD YOU USE IT FOR ANYTHING ELSE HANGING UP POULTRY IN THE KITCHEN 
YOU COULD USE THEM IN THE KITCHEN FOR HANGING POTS AND PANS FROM 
WELL THEY'RE CERTAINLY DESIGNER LOOKING AREN'T THEY 
YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE AN IMAGINATIVE MIND 
WHAT DATE HAVE THEY PUT ON THEM THERE'S NO DATE BUT THEY ARE FRENCH 
YES I MEAN THEY LOOK CONTINENTAL FROM THE CASTING 
I WOULDN'T SAY THEY WERE PARTICULARLY HUGELY ANTIQUE 
THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE SORT OF TWENTIETH CENTURY ONES BUT IN THAT ANTIQUE STYLE 
BUT FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKES A GOTHIC TOUCH IN THEIR DRAWING ROOM THEY'D BE GREAT WOULDN'T THEY 
WHAT HAVE THEY GOT ON THEM SIXTY EIGHT 
OH IT'S A BIT MUCH ISN'T IT 
I THINK IF YOU GOT THEM FOR AROUND FIFTY THERE MIGHT BE A CHANCE 
BUT I WILL WARN YOU THAT I THINK WITH THESE SORT OF THINGS 
YOU NEED TWO PEOPLE WITH IMAGINATION YEAH 
IF THEY'RE NOT AT THE AUCTION THEY MIGHT SINK WITHOUT TRACE YOU KNOW 
YOU MIGHT BE STUFFED TO USE A LOVELY CHICKEN METAPHOR 
YES BUT IF THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE WITH A BIT OF IMAGINATION WHO KNOWS 
THEY MIGHT FLY AWAY SHALL I SEE WHAT I CAN DO YEAH 
O. K. GO AND CLAW THEM DOWN A BIT 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA DO YOUR BEST 
HE'S GOT ALL THE GAGS TODAY BUT AT FIFTY QUID WILL THE BRASS CHICKEN FEET TURN INTO NUGGETS 
DO YOU FANCY BECOMING AN ANTIQUES COLLECTOR BUT YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN 
THEN WHY NOT TRY A DANCE AROUND OUR WEBSITE 
AFTER A BIT YOU'LL BECOME A REAL EXPERT 
BELIEVE ME IT'S A GREAT FEELING 
WHAT A FEELING I HAVE MUSIC NOW 
DAVID OH SORRY YOU DON'T NEED TO JUMP 
WE HAVE FOUND SOMETHING QUITE INTERESTING HERE 
O. K. BUT WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IT IS 
WHEN YOU OPEN IT UP YOU CAN SEE IT'S A LOVELY BOX BUT THE PICTURE'S QUITE BLACK 
IT'S JUST NOT CLEAR THAT'S TRUE 
IF YOU LOOK HERE THERE'S TWO HINGES HAVE YOU TRIED LIFTING IT 
WE DAREN'T RIGHT IT'S TOO FRAGILE IT IS FRAGILE ISN'T IT 
THERE WE ARE THERE'S TWO LITTLE HINGES EITHER SIDE WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN THE SIDE 
I SUGGEST YOU START LOOKING THROUGH IT LIKE THIS OH 
OH WOW CAN YOU SEE THAT OH ISN'T SHE GORGEOUS 
ISN'T SHE LOVELY SHE'S LOVELY 
THIS ONE IS QUITE RARE DO YOU KNOW WHY 
NO BECAUSE IT IS A COLOUR SLIDE NOT ONE THAT'S BLACK AND WHITE AND THEN BEEN TINTED VERY NICE 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE GLIMPSING INTO ANOTHER WORLD 
SOMEBODY ELSE'S WORLD IT'S WONDERFUL WELL I THINK THIS IS VERY CLEVER IT'S QUITE RARE 
DARE I ASK THE PRICE 
WELL IT WAS PRICED AT FORTY EIGHT ON THE STALL 
BUT SHARON'S DONE A LITTLE BIT OF NEGOTIATING 
HE CAN GET IT DOWN TO THIRTY SIX 
GET IT DOWN TO THIRTY SIX WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IT'S SO UNUSUAL I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE I THINK WE SHOULD GET IT 
OH GOOD 
YOU SHOULD BE DANCING 
FAYE VAL COULD I SHOW YOU SOMETHING I FOUND 
OH WHAT'S THAT WELL ORIGINALLY IT'S A SHELL CASE FROM THE GREAT WAR YOU KNOW NINETEEN FOURTEEN TO EIGHTEEN 
OH YEAH THIS IS WHAT WE GENERALLY REFER TO AS TRENCH ART 
AND THIS IS WHERE YOU KNOW A SOLDIER IN THE TRENCHES 
THERE WOULD BE MONTHS OF BOMBING AND FIGHTING 
BUT THEN THERE'D BE MONTHS OF THEM JUST SITTING THERE DOING VERY LITTLE 
SO WHAT THEY USED TO DO IS TAKE THE GOODS AROUND THEM THE SHELL CASES AND BULLET CASES 
AND MAKE THINGS OUT OF THEM 
AND HERE WE'VE GOT A LITTLE SORT OF MONEY BOX IN THE FORM OF A SORT OF 
COAL SCUTTLE BUT WITH ALL THIS LOVELY ENGRAVING 
AND THEY WOULD HAVE HAD VERY PRIMITIVE EQUIPMENT OF COURSE 
TO CUT ALL THIS STRUT WORK OUT AND TO DO ALL THIS LITTLE SORT OF POKERWORK ON IT THERE 
AND HE'S ALSO GOT HIS NAME ON THERE CHAPMAN WHICH IS VERY UNUSUAL TO SEE YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE THAT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I THINK THAT'S NICE 
IT'S VERY UNUSUAL AND IT'S FASCINATING HISTORY YOU COULD USE IT 
ABSOLUTELY WELL IT'S PRIMITIVE BUT IT'S GOT A LOT OF EMOTION ABOUT IT 
HOW MUCH IS IT I'VE HAD A WORLD WITH THE DEALER 
SHE KNOWS IT'S AN UNUSUAL PIECE WITH THE NAME AND ALL THIS NICE DECORATION ON THE FRONT 
SHE'D WANTED SIXTY FIVE FOR IT BUT I KNOCKED HER DOWN AND SHE WON'T GO ANY LOWER THAN SIXTY 
SO WE'LL GO FOR IT YES YES I THINK SO I THINK IT'LL MAKE A BOMB 
WELL LET'S HOPE IT CAUSES A LITTLE EXPLOSION YEAH 
IN THE END THE BLUES SHELLED OUT SIXTY 
NOW QUICKLY BEFORE IT RAINS AGAIN LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE REDS BOUGHT 
SHARON AND BEN WILL BE HOPING TO STOKE UP THE PROFIT WITH THIS BRASS COAL SCUTTLE BOUGHT FOR THIRTY FIVE

YEAH FOR A FORTNIGHT 
ANYWAY GOOD LUCK LET'S FIND OUT NOW WHAT THE BLUES BOUGHT 
WELL WELL WELL 
FOR THE BLUES THEIR INKWELL WAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE ITEM AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
THEY'RE A BIT LIKE BUSES ANOTHER COAL SCUTTLE THIS ONE SLIGHTLY MORE EXPENSIVE AT SIXTY

SO DID YOU HAVE FUN WITH THE LOVELY MARK 
YEAH LOTS OF FUN FAYE ANY EGG CUPS COME YOUR WAY 
I'VE SEEN ONE OR TWO BUT I'VE GOT THEM ALL VAL WHICH IS YOUR FAVOURITE ITEM 
I THINK THE HOOKS TO HOLD THE CURTAINS BACK THAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE YES WITH THE HENS' CLAWS 
WHAT'S GONNA BRING YOU THE BIGGEST PROFIT OH ANYBODY'S GUESS HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND 
TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE DID YOU 
RIGHT THAT'S FIFTY FIVE COMING MY WAY FIFTY FIVE WORTH OF LEFTOVER LOLLY FOR THE DAZZLING MR. STACEY 
GOT ANYTHING IN MIND OLD BOY 
OH SOMETHING QUIRKY I THINK TIM WHAT AGAIN MORE QUIRKY 
ANYWAY WE'LL FIND OUT HOW YOU'VE GOT ON AT THE AUCTION 
WE'RE AT NEWSTEAD ABBEY IN NOTTINGHAM HOME TO SOME STUNNING JAPANESE STYLING 
IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN DEEPEST DARKEST AFRICA 
THE OWNER OF THIS HOUSE WILLIAM WEBB GOT INTO DIFFICULTY 
WHO DO YOU PRESUME RESCUED HIM 
NO LESS THAN DOCTOR DAVID LIVINGSTONE HAH 
FORTUNATELY THE INCIDENT DIDN'T PUT THE FAMILY OFF TRAVELLING 
QUITE THE OPPOSITE AS IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES MR. WEBB'S TWO DAUGHTERS 
VISITED JAPAN AND THE IDEAS THEY RETURNED WITH CAN STILL BE SEEN 
ETHEL WEBB WAS AN ARDENT HORTICULTURALIST 
AND SHE DEVISED THE PLANS FOR A JAPANESE GARDEN HERE AT NEWSTEAD 
IN ORDER THAT IT SHOULD APPEAR AS AUTHENTIC AS POSSIBLE ETHEL INSISTED ON BRINGING BACK 
NOT ONLY PLANTS AND ORNAMENTS FROM JAPAN BUT SHE ALSO IMPORTED HER OWN JAPANESE GARDENER 
THE ETHOS BEHIND A JAPANESE GARDEN IS TO CAPTURE THE ESSENCE 
OF THE LANDSCAPE IN MINIATURE AND THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES 
THIS IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST AUTHENTIC JAPANESE GARDENS 
IN THE COUNTRY AND I TELL YOU IT IS JUST GLORIOUS 
THE WEBB SISTERS DIDN'T RESTRICT THEIR FAR EASTERN INFLUENCE JUST TO THE EXTERIOR OF THE HOUSE 
THEY TOOK A FAIRLY BORING UPSTAIRS ROOM AND TRANSFORMED IT INTO THEIR VISION OF JAPAN 
JUST LOOK WHAT THEY DID THEY TOOK TWO SIX FOLD JAPANESE SCREENS 
EACH OF WHICH WOULD BE ABOUT SIX FEET HIGH AND DESIGNED TO FOLD UP AND EXTEND ON THE GROUND 
TO STOP THE DRAUGHTS GETTING AT YOU 
THEY TOOK THOSE DRAUGHT SCREENS AND THEY APPLIED THEM HIGH UP ON THESE TWO WALLS 
ISN'T THAT A NOVEL IDEA 
AND THOSE SCREENS REPRESENT A JOY FOR A JAPANESE 
BECAUSE THE BIRDS ON THEM ARE RED CROWN CRANES AND THEY REPRESENT LONGEVITY 
IN OTHER WORDS YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE CRANES AND YOU'D THINK YOU WERE GONNA LIVE A LONG TIME 
AND IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY EACH OF THE FOLDS OF THE SCREEN 
IS MADE OF PAPER AS FRAGILE A MATERIAL AS THAT JUST STRETCHED ONTO CANVAS 
AND THE BEACH ITSELF LOOKS AS IF IT'S MADE OF A SERIES OF BITS OF PATCHWORK 
BUT THAT GOLDEN BEACH IS ACTUALLY A WHOLE LOT OF THREE INCH SQUARES OF PUMMELLED GOLD 
YOU POUND GOLD UNTIL IT BECOMES GOLD LEAF IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF TISSUE PAPER 
APPLY THAT TO THE REAL PAPER AT THE BACK WITH SOME HONEY AS AN ADHESIVE 
AND THAT'S THE EFFECT THAT YOU GET 
I MEAN THESE THINGS ARE INCREDIBLY RARE AND INCREDIBLY VALUABLE 
I DON'T SUPPOSE WE STAND THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE OF FINDING ANY DOWN AT THE AUCTION 
NO RED CROWN CRANES FOR US I FEAR 
PROBABLY JUST A LOT OF BALD EAGLES 
THERE MAY BE TROUBLE AHEAD 
NOW HOW ABOUT AN AUCTION 
LET'S HEAD OVER TO MELLORS AND AMP KIRK IN NOTTINGHAM 
LET'S FACE THE MUSIC AND DANCE 
IT'S GREAT TO BE AT MELLORS AND AMP KIRK'S AUCTION ROOM WITH NIGEL KIRK 
WELCOME SUPREMO 
NOW NIGEL BEN AND SHARON WENT WITH THIS COAL SCUTTLE 
WAS THAT A GOOD THING TO DO OR NOT 
I'VE SEEN BETTER I'M AFRAID 
COPPER AND BRASS IS OUT OF FASHION AT THE MOMENT 
I WOULD HOPE IT WOULD MAKE TWENTY OR THIRTY BUT IT MIGHT JUST BE A FIVER 
THIRTY FIVE THEY PAID 
AS YOU SAY IT MIGHT JUST MAKE A FIVE NOTE 
IF THAT HAD COME TO THE SALEROOM POLISHED AND READY TO GO HOME 
THAT TOO WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE WOULDN'T IT 
WELL I DON'T KNOW 
IN A WAY PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE THINGS LOOKING IN NEED OF RESTORATION 
IT OFFERS THE POSSIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO RESTORE SOMETHING 
THEY DO OCCASIONALLY SELL BETTER IN THIS CONDITION SO THAT'S THAT ONE KNOCKED ON THE HEAD 
NEXT UP IS THIS COLOUR SLIDE VIEWER 
A BIT OF A NOVELTY THIS ISN'T IT YES IT IS IT IS 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY EDWARDIAN 
IT'S A TRAVELLING VIEWER THE THING ISN'T IN IT TO FOLD DOWN AND BE TRANSPORTED 
SADLY SOME OF THE SILK THE WATERED SILK LINING IS RATHER FRAYED 
WHICH DOESN'T HELP IT BUT PHOTOGRAPHIC THINGS ARE QUITE A COLLECTABLE 
INDEED THEY ARE EARLY PHOTOGRAPHY CAMERAS AND IMAGES ARE VERY SOUGHT AFTER 
SO IF IT FOUND ITS NICHE HERE WHAT MIGHT IT MAKE 
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE THIRTY FORTY PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE 
WELL THAT'S NOT TOO BAD THEY PAID THIRTY SIX YOU SEE FAIR ENOUGH 
THEY WON'T MAKE A HUGE PROFIT BUT WON'T LOSE TOO MUCH 
THESE SPECULATIVE THINGS ARE THE THINGS TO BUY IF YOU CAN FIND THEM 
AND THAT IS A BIT SPECULATIVE 
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE COULD BE NO MORE SOLID SALEROOM STAPLE THAN THESE VICTORIAN BOXES COULD THERE 
INDEED INDEED ABSOLUTELY THEY ARE VERY 
FREQUENTLY FOUND EVEN STILL TODAY ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AFTER THEY WERE MADE 
ALTHOUGH THEY'RE SO BEAUTIFULLY MADE BECAUSE THEY'RE SO COMMON 
THEY OUGHT TO BE WORTH MORE THAN THEY ARE 
THEY NORMALLY MAKE DEPENDING ON THE SIZE FROM FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED 
GREAT COS THEY PAID TWENTY FOR THIS IT WAS A BARGAIN THAT WAS NOT EXPENSIVE WAS IT 
I THINK THEY SHOULD DO ALL RIGHT 
YES ANYWAY LET'S FIND OUT NOW ABOUT THE BONUS BUY 
SO THE TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT MOMENT DAVID BARBY HAD TWO HUNDRED NINE TO SPEND 
DAVID WHAT DID YOU SPEND ALL THAT MONEY ON 
OH 
THAT'S INTERESTING YOU GOT A REACTION ABSOLUTELY DO YOU LIKE IT 
THAT'S QUITE SWEET I THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE GOOD 
THIS IS A GUERNSEY IT'S IN THE FORM OF A GUERNSEY CREAM JUG OH RIGHT 
BUT IN FACT IT'S A SUGAR SHAKER AND IT'S SUCH AN UNUSUAL SHAPE 
I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE GREAT APPEAL I REALLY LIKE THAT 
IT'S LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT'S SHEFFIELD ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE 
AND IT'S GOT A GOOD HANDLE TO IT YEAH 
YOU KNOW YOU CAN PUT THIS OVER YOUR STRAWBERRIES OR YOUR RASPBERRIES 
SO IT HAS SOME USE AND RELEVANCE TODAY 
SO IT WOULD LOOK REALLY NICE YOU KNOW ME AND PRACTICAL 
FEEL IT AND HANDLE IT IT'S TACTILE THAT WOULD LOOK NICE ON A WHITE TABLECLOTH 
WOULDN'T IT GIVE IT A YANK IT DOES COME OFF SEE HOW NICELY MADE IT IS 
YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR SUGAR IN THAT LET BEN HAVE A LOOK HE'S GOT TO SEE IT 
GO ON BEN YOU HANDLE IT 
GOOD ON YOU BOY WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IS HOW MUCH DAVID BARBY PAID FOR IT 
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR I THOUGHT IT WAS A BARGAIN AT FORTY FIVE FORTY FIVE AND IT'S SOLID SILVER 
IT'S SOLID SILVER YES 
NOW HOW MUCH PROFIT DO YOU PREDICT ON THIS THEN DAVID 
IT'S AN UNUSUAL SHAPE AND I CAN PREDICT HOPEFULLY ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY 
WATCH HIS LIPS HE SAID TWENTY OR MORE ONE ALWAYS LIVES IN HOPE 
ANYWAY YOU'RE VERY VERY CONFIDENT OF A PROFIT ON THAT 
JUST REMEMBER THIS O. K. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE UNTIL YOU GET TO THE MOMENT OF SALE 
YOU'LL HAVE SOLD YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS 
AND THEN YOU CAN DECIDE TO TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT TO TAKE DAVID'S ADVICE OR NOT 
NOW FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT THIS LITTLE JOKER 
SO NIGEL WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
WOW WHAT INTERESTING OBJECT IT'S A SILVER JUG 
AND YET IT'S ACTUALLY A SUGAR CASTER AND NOVELTY PIECES LIKE THIS ARE VERY COLLECTABLE 
MAD ISN'T IT 
ABSOLUTELY WITTY A WONDERFUL THING 
MARKED ON THE COVER AS WELL AS THE BODY WHERE IT SHOULD BE SHEFFIELD ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE GREAT WHAT'S IT WORTH 
EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY IS IT REALLY HE ONLY PAID FORTY FIVE 
WELL DONE WELL DONE GOOD OLD BARBY 
NOW THE BLUES FAYE AND VALERIE BOUGHT THIS INKWELL 
I THINK THAT'S QUITE A NICE CHUNKY THING DON'T YOU YES IT IS 
THEY'RE FAIRLY FREQUENTLY FOUND BUT IT'S A GOOD SIZE A NICE BIG ONE 
YES ONE COULD IMAGINE CHURCHILL USING IT CAN'T YOU 
YES BIG MAN BIG INKWELL 
IDEAL FOR A MAN'S DESK BUT IT'S SUFFERED A LITTLE BIT IT'S RATHER DISTORTED 
AND DAMAGED YES BUT A NICE OBJECT 
YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY BRAVE HERE NIGEL AND COME UP WITH YOUR BEST QUOTE 
I'M GOING TO SAY FIFTY TO SEVENTY TIM 
I HAD A FUNNY FEELING YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THAT COS THEY PAID ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
THAT'S BIG ISN'T IT THAT'S PRETTY BRAVE 
THAT'S A TOP RETAIL TYPE PRICE FOR THAT 
I THINK THEY COULD HAVE NEGOTIATED A BETTER DEAL ON THAT 
YES STILL THERE SEEMS TO BE A TRENCH OPENING UP 
TALKING ABOUT TRENCHES WHAT ABOUT THE TRENCH ART COAL SCUTTLE MONEY BOX THAT'S WACKY 
IT IS DATED NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
MANY BRITISH SERVICEMEN BROUGHT BACK SOUVENIRS IF YOU LIKE FROM THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
BUT NOT MANY WERE MADE INTO SOMETHING QUITE AS IMAGINATIVE 
AS THIS MONEY BOX IN THE SHAPE OF A COAL SCUTTLE 
IT'S AN INTERESTING ITEM IT'S A KIND OF NOVELTY COLLECTABLE THIS TRENCH ART STUFF PEOPLE DO BUY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY WORTH TWENTY OR THIRTY IS THAT ALL M. M. M. 
GOSH THEY PAID SIXTY SO THERE MAY BE ANOTHER HOLE IN THE GROUND 
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY PAID THAT BECAUSE IT IS AN UNUSUAL ONE 
BUT COPPER AND BRASS ITEMS AGAIN ARE NOT PARTICULARLY SOUGHT AFTER 
UNLESS THEY'RE TERRIBLY OLD OR SPECIAL 
WELL THAT LEADS US VERY NEATLY INTO OUR NEXT BRASS ITEM THE PAIR OF FRENCH TIEBACKS 
DESIGNED AS CHICKEN'S FEET YEAH MOST IMAGINATIVE AND UNUSUAL OBJECTS THESE 
WHAT IS THE EMBLEM OF FRANCE THE CROWING COCK 
THE CROWING COCK AND THESE ARE THE FEET OF THE CROWING COCK UNDOUBTEDLY THE SAME ONE 
GREAT BUT NICE CAST JOBS 
SO A DECORATOR'S LOT YES 
THEY'RE ARE A LITTLE BIT UNDERSTATED I SUPPOSE REALLY TO BRING A HIGH PRICE 
I'D HAVE THOUGHT THIRTY OR FORTY O. K. WELL THEY PAID FIFTY 
AND THEY MAY THEREFORE BE VERY DEPENDENT ON THE BONUS BUY

FIFTY FIVE OF LEFTOVER LOLLY WAS ALL YOU LEFT MARK WHAT DID YOU SPEND IT ON

SO THIS THING'S NOT ROSEWOOD IT ALL IS IT IT'S WALNUT 
IT'S WALNUT AND INLAID IN A VARIETY OF WOODS CHIEFLY SYCAMORE YES 
IT'S QUITE A NICE LOOKING LITTLE BIT OF FURNITURE 
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A COAL FIRE WHAT WOULD YOU USE IT FOR 
NEWSPAPERS ANYTHING REALLY YOU COULD PUT A DRINK ON THE TOP 
YES STUFF YOUR BOY'S OWN MAGAZINE UNDERNEATH THAT'S RIGHT 
SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT THE NEIGHBOURS TO SEE O. K. FINE SO USEFUL 
GOOD LITTLE SIZE REASONABLE CONDITION SHOULD DO ALL RIGHT 
SHOULD DO ALL RIGHT I'D HAVE THOUGHT FORTY TO SIXTY 
GREAT FIFTY FIVE PAID 
ANYWAY MARK STACEY RATES IT FOR A PROFIT WE SHALL SEE 
WE SHALL SEE ON THE DAY WE SHALL SEE 
THE FIRST THING THAT STRIKES YOU ABOUT THESE SILVER BERRY DISHES 
IS THAT THEY ARE INCREDIBLY TINNY 
HEAR THAT THEY SOUND TINNY BECAUSE THEY ARE TINNY 
THESE THINGS ARE TRYING VERY HARD TO BE LATE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
THEY'RE TRYING TO BE AROUND THE RESTORATION OF CHARLES THE SECOND THAT'S AROUND ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY 
SILVER WAS NOT PLENTIFUL AND THE THINNISH THIN GAUGE MORE TINNY OBJECTS WERE MADE AT THAT PERIOD 
THEY'RE ELABORATELY EMBOSSED WITH FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE AROUND THIS OUTER BORDER WITH A SHAPED EDGE 
AND IF THEY DID DATE FROM AROUND ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY THIS PAIR OF DISHES WOULD BE WORTH BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
IT DOES BEG THE QUESTION WHAT ARE THEY DOING THEREFORE IN A GENERAL SALE IN NOTTINGHAM 
THE ANSWER IS OF COURSE THAT THEY'RE NOT ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY 
IF YOU TURN THEM OVER 
THERE'S A PERFECTLY REASONABLE HALLMARK HERE ON ONE SIDE WHICH IS FOR DUBLIN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY THREE 
SO A ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY THREE OBJECT MADE IN IRELAND 
HAS SOMEHOW BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO AN OBJECT THAT'S TRYING TO BE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY 
WELL THE OTHER THING TO NOTICE IS THE HALLMARKS HAVE GOT THESE SCRATCH MARKS THROUGH THEM 
THEY'VE BEEN ERASED AND IF YOU LOOK ON THE OTHER SIDE 
THERE'S A HALLMARK FOR THE LONDON ASSAY OFFICE THAT DATES FROM TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT THE AUCTIONEERS WERE SUSPICIOUS THAT THESE DISHES WEREN'T RIGHT 
THEY WEREN'T ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY AND THEY CERTAINLY WEREN'T EIGHTEENTH CENTURY DUBLIN 
SO THEY SENT THEM OFF THE ASSAY OFFICE AT GOLDSMITHS' AND SILVERSMITHS' HALL 
AND THEY SAID NO THEY'RE NOT CORRECT THEY ARE MADE OF SILVER 
AND WE'LL REHALLMARK THEM WITH A TWO THOUSAND FOUR HALLMARK WHICH MEANS TODAY THEY CAN BE LEGALLY SOLD 
SO A ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX TEN THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND HOW MUCH TODAY IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AFTER ALL THIS REHALLMARKING 
WELL THEY'RE ESTIMATED AT BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED 
AND WE'LL FIND DO WHAT THEY ACTUALLY BRING IN THE AUCTION IN A MINUTE
