I REALLY WANT TO COME KICK IT WITH YOU O. O. O. OOH 
YOU'LL BE MY AMERICAN BOY 
AMERICAN BOY 
PERFORMING LIVE IS UNIQUE TO ME BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE THE REAL ARTIST 
YOU GET TO SEE WHETHER THEY CAN ACTUALLY SING 
OR PLAY AND HOW THEY CONNECT WITH THE AUDIENCE 
WHETHER THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE REALLY DOING 
OR JUST A BUNCH OF STUDIO TRICKS AND MAKE UP 
IT'S HOW I GOT MY CAREER STARTED PERFORMING LIVE 
COULD YOU BE MY AMERICAN BO O. O. Y. 
BOY BOY BOY BOY 
HA 
THAT WAS EFFORTLESS THAT WAS GREAT ESTELLE IN THE LIVE LOUNGE DOING AMERICAN BOY 
O. K. THAT WAS ESTELLE AMERICAN BOY FROM A FEW WEEKS AGO 
SEMI VINTAGE CLASSIC PERFORMANCE JUST A FEW WEEKS OLD 
WE'VE BEEN INVITED INTO THE LOUNGE OF DAN LE S. A. C. V. S. SCROOBIUS PIP 
IT'S THEIR HOME WHICH THEY TAKE EVERYWHERE WITH THEM ON TOUR 
IT'S THEIR MOBILE HOME I LOVE IT IT'S LIKE MY GRAN'S 
LOOK AT THIS AMAZING 
WE'RE GOING TO SEE A PERFORMANCE OF LOOK FOR THE WOMAN 
THERE'S A WEIGHT OVER ME TODAY SOMETHING I HAVE TO SAY 
I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH TO LEAVE 
DON'T LIKE YOU ENOUGH TO STAY 
MY HEAD'S IN A MESS AND I'M STRESSED 
BUT I GUESS IT'S A TEST IN THE QUEST FOR HAPPINESS 
AND THE REST OF THAT MESS SO I BEST JUST ACQUIESCE 
EVEN THOUGH I'VE GROWN TIRED OF YOU 
AND THAT AIN'T MEANT TO SOUND SPITEFUL 
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE INSIGHTFUL 
WHEN I WRITE ALL MY EMOTIONS IN THE NIGHT 
ALL THE STUFF I TRY TO FIGHT JUST COMES OUT 
AND THE SAD FACT IS I'M SO TIRED OF YOU 
LOVE IT'S A WEIRD THING AIN'T IT 
THERE'S NO WAY TO EXPLAIN IT BUT I SWEAR AS WELL AS PAIN 
THERE SHOULD BE JOY BUT WE SUSTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF MUNDANE 
AND ITS NUMBING ME THROUGH 
I OFTEN WONDER IF I'D MISS YOU AND HAVE THE URGE TO KISS YOU 
IF AN ISSUE WAS TO HIT THROUGH TO THIS HEART THAT NOW FEELS DISUSED 
AND SAID ISSUE WAS TOO BIG TO JUST IGNORE AND I WALKED OUT ON YOU 
CHANCES ARE I'D FALL APART AND SUFFER SEIZURES OF THE HEART 
AS MY CHEST BEGINS TO SMART 
I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE START BUT THEN AGAIN 
MAYBE I'D JUST FEEL NEW 
MAYBE I'D GET MY LIFE ON TRACK AND START TO FOCUS MY ATTACK 
ON ALL THE THINGS MY LIFE JUST LACKS 
AND START TO CLAW MY PASSION BACK INSTEAD OF LIVING LIKE A HACK 
HALF COMMITTED HALF RELAXED I'D HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE 
THERE'S A WEIGHT OVER ME TODAY IT'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO SAY 
I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH TO LEAVE 
DON'T LIKE YOU ENOUGH TO STAY 
THERE'S A WEIGHT OVER ME TODAY SOMETHING I HAVE TO SAY 
I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH TO LEAVE 
DON'T LIKE YOU ENOUGH TO STAY 
I GUESS LATELY I'VE HAD TOO MUCH TIME TO THINK 
AND YEAH WAY TOO MUCH DRINK 
WHEN PAPER MEETS THE INK OVER THINKING IS THE CHINK IN MY ARMOUR 
THAT'S JUST WHAT I DO 
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY FOREVER QUESTIONING EACH DAY 
AND EVERY PLEA THAT'S MADE THAT MAYBE WHEN I LAY MY BUSY MIND 
WILL MAKE ME PROVE BY FINDING PROBLEMS AND REASONS 
THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE TRUE 
SEE WE GOT TOGETHER SO YOUNG BEFORE OUR REAL LIVES HAD BEGUN 
BUT FLOWERS DON'T GROW UP AS ONE EACH FINDS ITS OWN WAY TO THE SUN 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE 
WE'VE GROWN UP SEPARATELY TOO 
BUT FOR A FEW YEARS NOW 
IT'S BEEN THE PROBLEM AND THESE REALISATIONS 
I WISH THAT I COULD STOP THEM 
BUT I'VE REALISED THAT LOVE IS ALL WE HAVE IN COMMON 
AND DEEP DOWN YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE 
BUT THEN SURELY THAT I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU 
MEANS THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO 
TO GET US THROUGH AND TO PURSUE A BRAND NEW POINT OF VIEW 
ON HOW THIS GAP GREW BETWEEN ME AND YOU 
SO THERE'S A WEIGHT OVER ME AND I'D HATE TO HAVE TO LEAVE 
BUT IN FATE I DON'T BELIEVE AND THE STATE OF YOU AND ME 
ISN'T GREAT AS YOU CAN SEE SO I'LL KEEP THINKING THIS THROUGH 
THERE'S A WEIGHT OVER ME TODAY SOMETHING I HAVE TO SAY 
I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH TO LEAVE 
DON'T LIKE YOU ENOUGH TO STAY 
THERE'S A WEIGHT OVER ME TODAY SOMETHING I HAVE TO SAY 
I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH TO LEAVE 
DON'T LIKE YOU ENOUGH TO STAY 
THERE'S A WEIGHT OVER ME TODAY SOMETHING I HAVE TO SAY 
I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH TO LEAVE 
DON'T LIKE YOU ENOUGH TO STAY 
THERE'S A WEIGHT OVER ME TODAY SOMETHING I HAVE TO SAY 
I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH TO LEAVE 
DON'T LIKE YOU ENOUGH TO STAY
