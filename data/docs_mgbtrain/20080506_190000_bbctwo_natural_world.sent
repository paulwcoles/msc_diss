IN THE MIST OF THE ANDEAN CLOUD FOREST IN SOUTH AMERICA 
THERE'S A SHY MYSTERIOUS BEAST 
IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST ANIMALS IN THESE FORESTS YET IT'S SO ELUSIVE 
THAT UNTIL RECENTLY VERY LITTLE WAS KNOWN ABOUT IT 
IT'S A SPECTACLED BEAR 
THOUGH GLIMPSES OF IT IN THE WILD ARE RARE 
IT'S FAR MORE FAMILIAR FROM A CHILDREN'S BOOK 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT A BEAR CALLED PADDINGTON FROM DEEPEST DARKEST PERU 
ENTERED THE LIVES OF CHILDREN ACROSS THE WORLD THROUGH THE BOOKS OF MICHAEL BOND 
THERE'S ONLY ONE BEAR IN SOUTH AMERICA THE SPECTACLED 
SO PADDINGTON MUST BE ONE AND IN THE BOOK AT LEAST HE EATS MARMALADE 
BUT TO BIOLOGISTS THE REAL BOOK OF ITS LIFE IS ONLY NOW BEING WRITTEN 
AND AS ITS FOREST HOME IS DISAPPEARING FAST 
WE'RE RACING TO UNDERSTAND THE REAL BEAR TO STOP IT BECOMING EXTINCT 
BUT WHAT THEY HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS ENIGMATIC BEAR COULD PUT IT INTO EVEN GREATER DANGER 
NEW STAGGERING REVELATIONS ARE NOW COMING TO LIGHT 
THE ANDES RUN THE LENGTH OF SOUTH AMERICA 
AND IT'S UP IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN ANDES CLOSE TO THE EQUATOR THAT THE BEARS LIVE 
SKIRTING THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS ARE THICK DENSE CLOUD FORESTS WHICH RISE UP TO ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRES 
BEING BOTH HIGH AND ON THE EQUATOR THIS IS CALLED THE HIGH TROPICS RICH IN WILDLIFE 
THIS DAMP AIR CREATES PERFECT GROWING CONDITIONS 
THE BRANCHES OF TREES ARE FESTOONED WITH FLOWERING PLANTS 
THE SAME BROMELIADS THAT ATTRACT HUMMINGBIRDS ALSO ATTRACT BEARS 
THOUGH BOTH SEXES OF BEAR CLIMB TREES THE FEMALE BEARS WEIGHING A THIRD LESS THAN THE MALES 
ARE ABLE TO REACH THE MORE INACCESSIBLE PLANTS ON THE OUTER BRANCHES 
SPECTACLED BEARS LOVE BROMELIADS AND WITH THEIR EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF SMELL FIND THEM UP IN TREES 
WHAT THEY CAN SMELL IS THE PLANT'S SUGAR RICH CORE 
THE BEARS ARE CALLED SPECTACLED BECAUSE OF THE MARKINGS AROUND THEIR EYES 
ACTUALLY THEIR SIGHT ISN'T VERY GOOD 
THEY RELY MUCH MORE ON THEIR SENSE OF SMELL 
THE SPECTACLED BEAR IS THE MOST THREATENED OF ALL THE BEARS 
IT'S THE LAST MEMBER OF A FAMILY OF BEARS CALLED TREMARCTINE OR SHORT FACED BEAR 
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO THE OTHER SHORT FACED BEARS BECAME EXTINCT 
INCLUDING A GIANT ONE THAT WEIGHED MORE THAN A TON 
ABOVE THE CLOUD FOREST IT'S TOO COLD FOR TREES TO GROW 
THE LAND IS CARPETED WITH VAST SWATHES OF TALL GRASSES CALLED PARAMO 
PUYAS ARE GROUND BROMELIADS THAT GROW OUT HERE ON THE PARAMO AND CAN STAND OVER THREE METRES HIGH 
THE BEARS ARE LURED OUT OF THE CLOUD FOREST TO THE SWEET EPICENTRES OF THE PUYAS 
CLEARLY THIS BEAR HAS A SWEET TOOTH 
PERHAPS THIS IS THE BASIS FOR PADDINGTON'S LOVE OF MARMALADE 
THE BEARS ARE EXTREMELY WARY AND LIVE HIGH IN THE MOUNTAINS 
SO GETTING ANY INFORMATION ON THEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN HARD 
BUT WHAT SCIENTISTS WERE SURE ABOUT WAS THAT ALMOST ALL THEIR DIET WAS PLANTS 
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH CLOUD FORESTS BEING CLEARED AT AN ALARMING RATE 
SCIENTISTS HAVE WOKEN UP TO THEIR PLIGHT 
IN ECUADOR BIOLOGIST ARMANDO CASTELLANOS HAS DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS TO FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT THEM 
ALTHOUGH ARMANDO HAS STUDIED MANY ANIMALS IN THE CLOUD FOREST 
HIS GREATEST PASSION HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOR THE BEARS 
HE IS RADIO COLLARING A WILD BEAR THAT HAS BEEN TRAPPED AND SEDATED 
THIS IS A LARGE MALE BEAR HE ALSO HAS COLLARS ON OTHER ANIMALS 
SO HE CAN BUILD UP A PICTURE OF WHERE THE BEARS ARE AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
HE HOPES TO FIND OUT CRUCIALLY JUST HOW MUCH GROUND THE BEARS COVER 
ARMANDO ISN'T THE ONLY SCIENTIST IN THE ANDES WHO'S BECOME OBSESSED BY SPECTACLED BEARS 
FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DRY RUGGED FOOTHILLS OF PERU SPECTACLED BEARS ARE AT THE VERY EDGE OF THEIR RANGE 
THIS IS WHERE BIOLOGIST ROB WILLIAMS WORKS WITH THE BEARS ON A SMALL RESERVE CALLED CHAPARRI 
ROB CAME OUT HERE FROM ENGLAND AS A BIRD WATCHING TOUR GUIDE MARRIED A PERUVIAN GIRL 
AND SETTLED HERE TO ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY OWNED RESERVE WITH HIS NEW FATHER IN LAW 
I FIRST HEARD ABOUT SPECTACLED BEARS I GUESS AS A CHILD 
I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT MOMENT 
EVERYONE KNOWS PADDINGTON CAME FROM PERU 
IT WAS A MYTHICAL ANIMAL OF THE ANDES THAT NO ONE REALLY SAW OR KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT 
I CAME AS AN ORNITHOLOGIST INTERESTED IN BIRDS BUT I WANTED TO SEE A PUMA 
I WANTED TO SEE A SPECTACLED BEAR BECAUSE THESE ARE THE BIG EXCITING ANIMALS 
THOUGH THERE WERE RUMOURS OF BEARS LIVING IN THE CHAPARRI AREA 
NO ONE INCLUDING ROB KNEW FOR SURE WHETHER THEY WERE STILL THERE 
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I STARTED COMING DOWN HERE IN ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY NINE 
JUST AFTER THE PEACE AGREEMENT BETWEEN PERU AND ECUADOR 
THAT IT BECAME POSSIBLE AND I MET PEOPLE SAYING THERE ARE STILL SPECTACLED BEARS IN AN AREA 
AND THAT BECAME VERY INTERESTING WITH THE LOCAL PEOPLE HERE AND SOME OTHER BIOLOGISTS 
WE STARTED TO GET INTERESTED IN THEM THINKING HOW ARE THEY STILL DOING 
IT'S AMAZING THEY'RE STILL HERE 
BUT IN SUCH A VAST LANDSCAPE AND WITH LIMITED RESOURCES 
HOW COULD ROB EVER BE ABLE TO FIND ONE LET ALONE LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT THEM 
REMOTE CAMERAS TRIGGERED BY AN INFRA RED BEAM WERE A POSSIBLE ANSWER 
UNLIKE PEOPLE THEY NEITHER SMELL NOR MOVE AND CAN REMAIN UNFLINCHING NIGHT AND DAY FOR WEEKS AT A TIME 
THE DRY RIVERBEDS ON THE RESERVE ALWAYS HAVE A FEW REMAINING POOLS OF WATER 
AND ROB KNEW THAT IF THE BEARS WERE THERE AT ALL THEY WOULD COME TO DRINK SOONER OR LATER 
WEEK AFTER WEEK ROB AND HIS TEAM VISITED EACH CAMERA TRAP IN THE MOUNTAINS 
RETURNING TO BASE WITH THE CRUCIAL EVIDENCE ON THE MEMORY CARDS 
WHAT THEY FOUND EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS 
SEEING THE FIRST PHOTO ON THE CAMERA WAS REALLY EXCITING YOU KNOW 
WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW WELL IT WOULD WORK OR HOW MANY PHOTOS WE'D GET 
WE GOT A NICE PHOTO OF ONE IN A POOL WITH ITS FACE COMING RIGHT UP OUT OF THE WATER LOOKING AT US 
WE HAD THE WHOLE FACIAL PATTERN IT WAS A REALLY EXCITING MOMENT 
WE SUDDENLY REALISED WE CAN DO THIS AND WE CAN USE THIS TO STUDY THESE BEARS 
GRADUALLY WE BUILT UP A PICTURE 
AND WE KNOW NOW THAT THERE ARE NINE OR TEN BEARS USING THIS VALLEY ON A REGULAR BASIS 
PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX IN IT AT ANY ONE TIME 
THE STUDY CONTINUES BUT IT'S SLOW 
SO ROB ALSO VALUES THE INFORMATION HE'S GETTING FROM A GROUP OF RESCUED BEARS 
WHICH LIVE IN AN ENCLOSURE IN THE RESERVE 
THESE BEARS HAVE BEEN RESCUED FROM CAPTIVITY 
ILLEGALLY HELD IN CIRCUSES ZOOS FACTORIES SAW MILLS PRIVATE PEOPLE'S HOUSES 
THEY HAVE A BETTER LIFE HERE WE CAN LEARN STUFF FROM THEM 
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LOCALS CAN COME HERE AND SEE THE BEARS 
AND IT CREATES A LOCAL SOURCE OF RESPECT 
THE CAMERA TRAPS HAVE SHOWN US THAT THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE BEARS IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WAS BELIEVED 
PEOPLE BELIEVED THEY WERE PROBABLY NOCTURNAL 
IT WAS PUBLISHED IN SEVERAL REPORTS 
BUT WE'VE FOUND THROUGH THE CAMERA TRAPPING THERE'S NO NIGHT TIME ACTIVITY AT ALL 
HE'S ALSO WITNESSED SOMETHING ELSE WHICH IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY THE BEARS MAKING BEDS IN THE TREES 
BIOLOGISTS HAVEN'T YET FOUND A DEN 
BUT MOTHERS AND THEIR CUBS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED TO REMAIN TOGETHER FOR OVER A YEAR 
TWO CUBS IS THE NORM 
NOT MUCH MORE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR UPBRINGING 
AS ROB GETS TO KNOW SPECTACLED BEARS BETTER 
HE'S STARTING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY SURVIVE HERE AT THE VERY EDGE OF THEIR RANGE 
IN THIS HABITAT ESPECIALLY IN THE DRY FORESTS 
THEY'RE TRAPPED IN THE EDGE OF THEIR POSSIBLE LIMIT OF SURVIVAL 
YOU KNOW THIS IS AN EXTREME ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM 
THEIR DIET WAS THOROUGHLY STUDIED HERE FORTY YEARS AGO 
SCIENTISTS DECIDED THAT THESE BEARS WERE MAINLY VEGETARIAN 
WITH PROTEIN FROM TERMITES AND BEETLES MAKING UP A SCANT TWO PER CENT OF THEIR MEALS 
SOME ANDEAN PEOPLE PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT KEEP LIVESTOCK 
BELIEVE THAT BEARS ARE EVEN PREDATORY BUT THIS IS SOMETHING SCIENTISTS ARE QUICK TO DISMISS 
IN MY YEARS HERE AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES 
I'VE HEARD MANY REPORTS OF AMAZING THINGS FROM OTHERWISE CREDIBLE WITNESSES 
THE IN BUILT BELIEFS AND HATREDS TOWARDS PREDATORS IN ANDEAN COMMUNITIES 
CAN OFTEN LEAD PEOPLE TO TELL YOU THINGS THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE SEEN 
THERE'S A MAN HERE WHO'S TOLD ME HE'S SEEN A PEREGRINE CUT THE HEADS OFF FOUR CHICKENS WITH ITS WINGS 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY RUBBISH HE'S OTHERWISE A VERY RELIABLE OBSERVER 
ROB THINKS THAT SCIENTISTS MUST STICK TO WHAT THEY SEE 
HERE IN PERU EVEN AT THE PEAK OF THE DRY SEASON WHICH LASTS FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTHS OF THE YEAR 
WHEN THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO FRUIT NO INSECTS NO NOTHING 
THEN THE BEARS AT CHAPARRI EAT NOTHING MORE THAN BARK 
THEIR TEETH CAN RIP DEEP INTO THE TRUNK OF LEAFLESS PASALLO TREES 
WHERE SUGARS ARE STORED AND THIS IS ENOUGH AMAZINGLY FOR THE BEARS TO SURVIVE 
INTERESTINGLY THE BEARS SEEM TO HAVE A SIXTH SENSE FOR WHEN AND WHERE TO FIND FRUITING TREES 
WHEN THESE BERRIES APPEAR MUCH LOWER DOWN THE MOUNTAIN THE BEARS ARE SOON ONTO THEM 
IS IT THEIR SENSE OF SMELL OR IS INFORMATION BEING PASSED DOWN FROM MOTHER TO CUB 
ROB KNOWS THAT BEARS QUICKLY MOVE INTO HIS AREA WHEN FRUITS APPEAR 
HOWEVER HE HAS NO IDEA HOW MUCH GROUND THESE SAME BEARS ARE ALSO USING OUTSIDE THE RESERVE 
BACK IN ECUADOR THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT ARMANDO IS TRYING TO FIND OUT 
WORKING AT THIS ALTITUDE FOR WEEKS AT A TIME IS HARD 
A HORSE IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET AROUND UP HERE 
THE HORSES ON THIS RANCH AT YANAHURCO 
ARE DIRECT DESCENDENTS OF ONES BROUGHT FROM SPAIN BY THE CONQUISTADORES 
AND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OF ALTITUDE HAVE GIVEN THEM THE LUNGS FOR THE JOB 
IT'S SOON CLEAR ARMANDO WILL NEED STAMINA TOO 
IN THIS TERRAIN IT'S HARD TO PICK UP THE SIGNAL FROM THE RADIO COLLARED BEAR 
AT THIS HIGH SPOT HE OUGHT TO GET A GOOD SIGNAL 
HE NEEDS LINE OF SIGHT TO PINPOINT THE TRANSMISSION FROM THE COLLARS 
AND IN THIS TERRAIN THAT CAN BE HARD 
STATIC 
IT SEEMS THAT HIS BIG MALE BEAR HAS MOVED OVER FIFTEEN KILOMETRES IN ONE DAY 
AND IS NOW HEADING NORTH WEST FROM THE PARAMO TO DENSER TERRAIN 
BUT THESE DEEP VALLEYS DON'T JUST MAKE THE SIGNAL DIFFICULT TO FIND THEY SLOW HIM RIGHT DOWN 
ARMANDO REALIZES HE NEEDS SOME WAY OF GETTING ABOVE IT ALL 
HE GETS THE HELP OF LOCAL FLYING ENTHUSIAST JORGE ANHALZER 
ARMANDO WILL TAKE HIS RECEIVER WITH HIM AND BE ABLE TO COVER MUCH MORE GROUND 
JORGE DOES A FINAL ENGINE CHECK 
THEY'LL BE FLYING OVER TERRAIN WHERE AN EMERGENCY LANDING WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE 
RADIO TRACKING FROM THE AIR ALLOWS ARMANDO TO BUILD UP A PICTURE OF WHERE HIS COLLARED BEARS ARE MOVING 
AFTER SEVERAL FLIGHTS OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS HE IS ABLE TO MAP THE SIGNALS 
HE CAN SEE THE ENTIRE RANGE THAT THE MALE BEAR HAS COVERED OVER THAT TIME 
IT IS SIXTEEN THOUSAND HECTARES 
THAT'S HALF THE SIZE OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT 
IT'S BIGGER THAN ANYONE HAD IMAGINED 
HE'S ALSO DISCOVERED THAT WITHIN THE SAME AREA THERE ARE ALSO TWO FEMALES 
IF A BEAR NEEDS SO MUCH LAND TO SURVIVE 
THEN AN ENCROACHMENT ON ITS TERRITORY PUTS IT UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE 
PEOPLE ARE PUSHING FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO REMOTE AREAS 
OFTEN CLEARING AREAS OF ONCE PRISTINE CLOUD FOREST TO GRAZE THEIR CATTLE 
EVERY HILLSIDE THAT IS CLEARED DENIES THE BEAR A FEW TREES DRIPPING IN BROMELIADS 
OR A PATCH OF SUGAR RICH PUYAS 
THE CATTLE ARE ALSO BEING TAKEN RIGHT UP ONTO THE HIGH PARAMO 
SCIENTISTS LIKE ARMANDO ARE EAGER TO FIND OUT HOW THE BEARS ARE COPING WITH THESE CHANGES 
BACK ON THE GROUND ARMANDO RETURNS TO THE SPOT WHERE HE OBTAINED THE MOST RECENT SIGNAL 
THE SIGNAL IS VERY STRONG 
THE FREQUENCY TELLS HIM IT'S THE BIG MALE BEAR 
IT MUST BE CLOSE 
BUT A CONDOR IS CIRCLING 
THOUGH THEY'RE QUITE COMMON HERE 
TO SEE THEM IN FLIGHT LIKE THIS GENERALLY INDICATES THAT THERE'S A CARCASS AROUND 
MIGHT HIS BEAR BE DEAD 
BUT SUDDENLY THE BEAR'S SIGNAL STRENGTHENS AND ARMANDO GETS A SIGHTING 
THERE SHE IS OVER THERE 
IT'S ALIVE AND WELL 
ARMANDO TRIES TO SEE WHERE THE BEAR IS HEADING 
IT SEEMS TO BE FOLLOWING A SCENT 
A DEAD COW 
AND THE BEAR SEEMS VERY INTERESTED 
TO ARMANDO'S AMAZEMENT THE BEAR STARTS TO GORGE ON THE BELLY OF THE COW 
IT'S ONE MORE OBSERVATION THAT HAS HELPED TURN EVERYTHING THAT WE KNEW ABOUT SPECTACLED BEARS ON ITS HEAD 
FORGET BEETLES AND TERMITES 
THIS BEAR CLEARLY HAS A TASTE FOR RAW STEAK TOO 
THIS EXTRAORDINARY SIGHTING ENCOURAGES ARMANDO TO CONTINUE HIS TREK ACROSS THE PARAMO 
FOUR DAYS LATER ANOTHER INTRIGUING OBSERVATION A LONG TRAIL THROUGH THE GRASS 
THE GROUND HAS BEEN TRODDEN DOWN 
IT SEEMS THAT SOMETHING BIG HAS BEEN DRAGGED DOWN THE HILL 
AND NOT FIFTY NOR ONE HUNDRED BUT TWO HUNDRED METRES DOWN THE HILL 
ARMANDO FOLLOWS THE TRAIL DOWN 
AT THE END OF IT IS ANOTHER CARCASS 
IT'S ANOTHER DEAD COW 
THERE ARE TOOTH MARKS OF BEAR AND CLAW MARKS TOO 
THERE ARE WELL KNOWN CATTLE KILLERS UP HERE PUMAS 
BUT IT'S STILL SURPRISING TO FIND A SPECTACLED BEAR SCAVENGING ON ONE OF THEIR KILLS 
PERHAPS THE BEARS ARE BEING PUSHED INTO SCAVENGING MEAT BECAUSE THEIR HABITAT IS BEING BROKEN UP 
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ARMANDO TO ASSESS WHAT BEARS NORMALLY DO IN THE WILD 
TO STUDY THE BEAR'S NATURAL DIET 
ARMANDO HAS STARTED VISITING A MUCH MORE PRISTINE UNSPOILT PART OF ECUADOR 
IT'S A PLACE SO REMOTE IT TAKES DAYS FROM QUITO IN A LAND ROVER AND THEN MORE DAYS ON HORSEBACK 
A DANGEROUS JOURNEY ALONG TREACHEROUSLY STEEP RIDGES 
TO THE WILD PRISTINE FOOTHILLS OF MOUNT SANGAY 
AND NO ONE COMES HERE FOR A VERY GOOD REASON 
EVERY NOW AND THEN QUITE RANDOMLY IT ERUPTS 
THE LOCALS WON'T COME WITHIN MILES OF HERE 
ARMANDO KNOWS WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR 
THIS IS DENSE PRISTINE CLOUD FOREST 
AND ARMANDO CAN RECOGNISE THE TRAIL LEFT BY SPECTACLED BEARS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH IT 
AFTER MANY HOURS OF SEARCHING HE FINDS A VITAL CLUE 
THE FAECES OR SCATS OF A BEAR 
AND IN IT HAIRS 
ARMANDO IS SURE THAT THESE HAIRS BELONG TO THE MOUNTAIN TAPIR 
MOUNTAIN TAPIRS ARE INDIGENOUS TO THE CLOUD FORESTS OF THE ANDES 
THEY'RE ABOUT THE SIZE OF DONKEYS BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD TO EAT 
HAVE BEEN HUNTED OUT OF MOST OF THEIR FORMER RANGE 
BUT AT MOUNT SANGAY WHERE THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO PEOPLE THE TAPIRS ARE ABUNDANT 
FOR ARMANDO IT'S A REVELATION THAT SPECTACLED BEARS HAVE PROBABLY ALWAYS SCAVENGED ON CARCASSES 
ON INDIGENOUS CREATURES SUCH AS MOUNTAIN TAPIR WHICH WERE HERE LONG BEFORE CATTLE 
BUT THIS REVELATION ALSO MAKES HIM RECONSIDER 
A LOT OF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HE'S HELD ABOUT SPECTACLED BEARS 
LIKE ROB WILLIAMS IN PERU 
ARMANDO HAS BEEN IGNORING THE LOCAL CAMPESINOS' RATHER WILD CLAIMS THAT BEARS WERE ATTACKING LIVE CATTLE 
HE PUTS OUT THE WORD THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM ANYONE MAKING THESE KINDS OF CLAIMS 
SENORA 
SE ACUERDA COMO ESTA 
SE ACUERDA DE LO DE A WOMAN RESPONDS 
SHE LIVES IN A REGION OF ECUADOR CALLED COSANGA 
SHE RECOUNTS TO ARMANDO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY SHE SAW DOWN BY THE RIVER 
IF HE HAD MET THIS LADY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN TO SANGAY 
HE WOULD'VE DISMISSED HER ASSUMPTION THAT THE BEAR WAS ACTUALLY ATTACKING THE TAPIR 
BUT KNOWING NOW THAT SOME BEARS HAVE A TASTE FOR RAW MEAT 
HE CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER WHETHER THERE'S MORE TO THIS BEAR THAN SCIENTISTS HAVE EVER BELIEVED 
LESS THAN THIRTY KILOMETRES AWAY BUT STILL IN THE SAME REGION COSANGA 
A CAMPESINO IS KEEN TO TAKE ARMANDO UP THE HILL TO THE CLEARINGS IN THE FOREST MADE FOR THE CATTLE 
HERE THE CAMPESINO PULLS OUT A PHOTOGRAPH OF A COW 
THE COW HAS BEEN FATALLY WOUNDED 
THE CAMPESINO CLAIMS IT WAS ATTACKED BY A BEAR 
TWO ATTACKS ALLEGEDLY BY BEARS ONLY THIRTY KILOMETRES APART 
THAT'S WITHIN THE HOME RANGE OF ONE HUNGRY MALE BEAR 
CLAW MARKS ON A TREE PROVE THAT THERE ARE BEARS HERE 
COULD IT BE THAT SPECTACLED BEARS LIKE GRIZZLY BEARS ARE ATTACKING AND KILLING LARGE MAMMALS 
IF TRUE THIS WOULD BE SHOCKING NEWS FOR THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY 
AND THERE ARE SCIENTISTS LIKE ROB WILLIAMS IN PERU WHO DON'T BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE STACKS UP 
THE SPECTACLED BEAR IS A SMALL BEAR 
THE BIGGEST ONES THEY'RE REPORTING ARE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY KILOS 
A COW WEIGHS ABOUT FOUR TIMES WHAT A SPECTACLED BEAR WEIGHS THAT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE 
THERE ARE VERY FEW PREDATORS IN THE WORLD THAT TAKE OUT PREY ALONE THAT ARE THAT MUCH BIGGER THAN THEM 
THEY BELIEVE WHAT THEY'RE TELLING YOU BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SAY WHOSE COW HAS BEEN KILLED 
IT'S THE NEIGHBOUR OF MY COUSIN'S FRIEND 
AND YOU KNOW I WANT TO SEE SOMEONE WHY HAS NO ONE PROVEN IT 
NO ONE'S EVER SHOWN US A DEAD COW AND WE'VE GOT THERE IN TIME AND SAID YES A BEAR KILLED THIS COW 
BUT IN A REMOTE PART OF ECUADOR THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
THERE'S A REMOTE COMMUNITY AT A PLACE CALLED OYACACHI 
ISAAC GOLDSTEIN IS A VENEZUELAN BIOLOGIST FOLLOWING THE SAME LEADS AS ARMANDO 
ISAAC HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING CLAIMS ABOUT BEAR ATTACKS ON CATTLE 
ACROSS THE BEARS' RANGE IN VENEZUELA AND BOLIVIA AS WELL AS HERE IN ECUADOR 
ISAAC LISTENS CAREFULLY TO WHAT THE PEOPLE AT OYACACHI HAVE TO SAY 
THEY'VE TOLD THESE STORIES MANY TIMES BUT FEW PEOPLE HAVE BELIEVED THEM 
THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT THE BEAR WAS ATTACKING A COW 
THE ONLY KNOWN CONFLICT WITH THE BEARS IS THAT THEY ARE SPOTTED IN FIELDS OF MAIZE 
MAIZE IS INCREASINGLY GROWN IN FOREST CLEARINGS 
AND LOOKS LIKE THE TALL PUYA THAT THE BEARS LOVE TO EAT ANYWAY 
SO PEOPLE AND BEARS ARE IN CONFLICT ALREADY 
IF PEOPLE ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT BEARS ATTACKING CATTLE 
WHAT HOPE IS THERE OF LOCAL PEOPLE CARING FOR THIS BEAR 
DENIS TORRES WORKS FOR A CONSERVATION ORGANISATION CALLED ANDIGENA AND THINKS THAT 
LOCAL PEOPLE ARE BEING SWAYED BY A LONG HELD MISTRUST OF BEARS 
THE CAMPESINO BELIEVE THE SPECTACLED BEAR IS A REAL PREDATOR 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF MISCONCEPTION MAYBE 
IT'S THE HERITAGE FOR THE SPANISH PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE COMING TO SOUTH AMERICA THEY HAVE 
A LONG HISTORY OF CONFLICT WITH BROWN BEARS IN SPAIN OR IN EUROPE 
BUT SCIENTISTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GET TO THE TRUTH AND FAST 
BECAUSE LOCAL PEOPLE ARE ALREADY TAKING THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS 
HUNTING IS THOUGHT TO BE ONE OF THE MAJOR CAUSES OF POPULATION REDUCTION 
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED BEARS ARE SHOT EACH YEAR EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES 
THE BEARS' REPUTATION AS A CROP RAIDER IS BAD ENOUGH 
ANDIGENA DON'T WANT ITS IMAGE TO BE TARNISHED ANY FURTHER 
THEY MAKE NO MENTION OF THE STORIES OF BEARS HUNTING DOWN CATTLE 
TORRES DISTRIBUTES ATTRACTIVE BROCHURES TO FARMERS IN REMOTE COMMUNITIES 
TO HELP DISPEL ANY NEGATIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE BEAR 
THE FARMER LIVING HERE IN THIS AREA HAS SEEN CONSTANTLY ONE SPECTACLED BEAR CLOSE TO HIS FARM 
AND HE TOLD ME I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM RELATED WITH CATTLE PREDATION 
IN FACT THE SPECTACLED BEAR LIVES VERY CLOSE TO MY HOME BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE BEAR 
SOMETIMES THE BEAR IS EATING THE CORN IN MY CROPS 
BUT I DON'T FEEL AFRAID ABOUT THE BEAR OR ANY BAD IMAGE ABOUT THE BEAR 
BUT THIS APPROACH IS CAUSING A RIFT WITH BIOLOGISTS 
I GET VERY MAD AT THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE PREACHING 
WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAPPEN IN THE WORLD 
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING 
COMO ESTA MUCHO GUSTO 
IF WE GO TO A SETTLEMENT THAT IS HAVING PROBLEMS 
AND WE SAY TO THE CATTLE OWNERS YOU HAVE NO PROBLEMS 
WE WILL LOSE ALL THE CREDIBILITY 
BECAUSE WE WILL BE LIARS 
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SEEING 
THEY ARE EXPERTS ON THEIR CATTLE 
THE CAMPESINO BELIEVE THE BEAR IS THE MAIN REASON FOR THE CATTLE LOSS 
I AM NOT VERY SURE ABOUT THAT 
I THINK THAT THE PUMA IS THE MAIN ANIMAL PROVOKING THE CATTLE DEATH 
AT OYACACHI ISAAC GOLDSTEIN IS INCREASINGLY CONVINCED THAT 
IT'S NOT A PUMA BUT A BEAR THAT'S ATTACKING AND KILLING THEIR CATTLE 
A CALF HAS BEEN FOUND ON THE PARAMO MOTHERLESS AND INJURED 
O. K. WE CAN SEE HERE CLEARLY THE CLAW MARKS OF THE ATTACK 
VERY SUPERFICIAL HOWEVER 
THIS IS THE ONLY PROFOUND WOUND 
WE DON'T SEE ANYTHING HERE IN THE BASE OF THE SKULL OR THE THROAT SO IT IS NOT A PUMA ATTACK 
AND THE MOTHER OF THIS CALF IS MISSING SO WE SHOULD LOOK FOR HER AND SEE AND CONFIRM THE BEAR ATTACK 
WE WILL LOOK FOR THE REMAINS OF THE MOTHER AND CONFIRM THE BEAR ATTACK 
THE OWNER OF THESE CATTLE CALLED MELCHOR CONTINUES ALONE IN THE SEARCH FOR HIS MISSING COW 
FOLLOWING HOOF MARKS AND DISTURBED VEGETATION HE ENTERS THE CLOUD FOREST 
HE SOON IDENTIFIES AN AREA ON THE GROUND WITHIN THE FOREST WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE STRUGGLE 
THE GROUND HAS BEEN KICKED UP AND THERE ARE TRACES OF HAIRS 
HE FOUND A DEAD COW 
ONE OF HIS COWS DEAD AND OTHER SIGNS OF STRUGGLE 
HE FOLLOWED THE SIGNS OF DRAGGING 
AND THEN AT THE END OF THE SIGNS HE FOUND THE DEAD COW 
FROM WHAT REMAINS IT'S HARD TO TELL WHETHER THIS WAS THE MOTHER OF THE WOUNDED CALF 
BUT MELCHOR IS SURE THAT IT HAS BEEN ATTACKED BY A BEAR 
NOW THESE SIGNS OF DRAGGING 
WERE EXACTLY WHAT ARMANDO SAW ON THE PARAMO 
PERHAPS THAT WASN'T A PUMA ATTACK AFTER ALL 
BACK AT OYACACHI ISAAC BELIEVES HE'S NOW BUILDING UP THE PROFILE OF A BEAR ATTACK 
A SERIES OF DISTINCTIVE CLUES 
HE FOLLOW OTHER TRAILS AND AT THE END OF ONE OF THOSE HE FOUND A BIG 
GROUND NEST WITH SCATS AND CLAW MARKS ON TREES 
THESE CLAW MARKS TEND TO APPEAR ON TREES LESS THAN A HUNDRED METRES FROM WHERE A BEAR HAS FED 
ARMANDO SAW THEM AT COSANGA 
IS THIS WHERE LITTLE PADDINGTON SHARPENED HIS MARMALADE SPOON 
INTO A BUTCHER'S KNIFE 
THERE'S EVEN MORE EMPHATIC EVIDENCE TO COME 
HE'S TELLING ME THAT HE HAVE HAD PREVIOUS ATTACK ON HIS CATTLE 
AND SHOWING ME A PICTURE 
AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE TYPICAL SIGNS WHERE THE BEARS ATTACK CATTLE 
ISAAC IS NOW IN NO DOUBT 
THERE IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR BETWEEN A PUMA KILL AND A SPECTACLED BEAR KILL 
THE PUMA KILL YOU SEE ALL THE EVIDENCE IN THE THROAT 
THAT'S THE KILL OF A PUMA 
THERE'S NO WAY NO WAY YOU CAN MISTAKE ONE KILL FROM THE OTHER 
THERE IS NO WAY 
AND THESE ARE THE SAME WOUNDS THAT ARMANDO SAW IN THE PHOTOS AT COSANGA 
IT'S LIKE SOLVING A CRIMINAL CASE WITH HUMANS 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE THE GUY SHOOTING 
AT THE PERSON YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE EVIDENCE 
BUT DOWN IN PERU ROB WILLIAMS REMAINS CAUTIOUS 
IN CHAPARRI HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE 
THAT BEARS KILL OTHER ANIMALS SO HE PREFERS TO UNDERSTATE THE CLAIMS 
IT IS INTERESTING THESE NEW STUDIES AND THE NEW EVIDENCE 
IT IS SHOWING US NEW ASPECTS OF THIS ANIMAL WE KNEW SO LITTLE ABOUT 
WE'RE LEARNING THAT IT IS MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST IT'S LESS VEGETARIAN THAN WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT 
ONCE UPON A TIME SCIENTISTS JUST WANTED TO FIND OUT ENOUGH ABOUT THIS BEAR TO SAVE IT FROM EXTINCTION 
NOW THEY CANNOT AGREE ON THE NEXT STEP 
WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH WHAT WE DO WITH ANY INFORMATION THAT COMES OUT ABOUT PREDATION WITH THIS BEAR 
WE'VE GOT TO REPORT IT YOU'VE GOT TO BE AS A SCIENTIST FACTUAL 
BUT WE'VE GOT TO PUT IT INTO CONTEXT THAT IT MAY HAPPEN IN SOME AREAS BUT IN OTHER AREAS IT ISN'T HAPPENING 
IT MAY BE AT WORST A FEW INDIVIDUAL BEARS THAT LEARN THIS 
IN THE ANDES FOR MANY YEARS PEOPLE HAVE SAID THEY'RE PREDATORY ANIMALS 
WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT THEY REALLY ARE PREDATORY 
AND THINK ABOUT SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM NOT JUST SAY THEY'RE PREDATORY 
AND CREATE A WORSE PRESS FOR THE BEAR 
BECAUSE IN THE MAIN AND IN MANY AREAS LIKE THIS THEY ARE NOT TAKING CATTLE 
ISAAC AGREES THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE A PROBLEM EVERYWHERE 
BUT HE THINKS IT'S TIME TO FACE UP TO WHAT'S GOING ON 
WE CANNOT SAY THAT IT IS 
A WIDESPREAD BEHAVIOUR AND THAT IN ALL LOCALITIES ALL BEARS ATTACK CATTLE 
BUT IN CERTAIN LOCALITIES CERTAIN BEARS BECOME A PROBLEM AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM 
THE PROBLEM IS HOW YOU 
KEEP THE CATTLE AWAY FROM THE BEARS AND THE BEARS AWAY FROM THE CATTLE 
THAT'S THE MAIN PROBLEM 
ONE SOLUTION MIGHT BE TO BRING LLAMAS AND GUANACOS BACK TO THE NORTHERN ANDES 
UNLIKE CATTLE THEY'RE NATIVE TO THE ANDES AND HAVE SHARED THE MOUNTAINS WITH BEARS FOR MILLENNIA 
THEY MIGHT BE BETTER THAN COWS AT SCRAMBLING OFF STEEP SLOPES WHEN CHASED BY A BEAR 
ANOTHER SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT MIGHT BE TO MANAGE THE CATTLE BETTER 
FENCE THEM INTO THE LOWER SLOPES OR EVEN PAY OUT COMPENSATION MONEY WHEN COWS ARE LOST 
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE ONLY REASON WE ARE HAVING PROBLEMS 
IS BECAUSE WE'VE ENCROACHED ON THE BEARS' WORLD 
THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT THE SPECTACLED BEAR THE MORE INTRIGUING WE FIND THEM TO BE 
THEY'RE SURVIVING BY CHANGING THEIR BEHAVIOUR AS WE REPLACE THEIR FOREST FOODS WITH COWS 
THEY'RE DOING THEIR LEVEL BEST TO HANG ON 
ARE WE DOING OUR BEST TO HELP THEM 
IT'LL BE A VERY SAD WORLD IF WE CAN'T LIVE WITH SPECTACLED BEARS WITH THE SIX THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND SPECTACLED BEARS 
IF WE CAN'T FIND A SPACE FOR THEM IN SIX ANDEAN COUNTRIES 
THE SPECTACLED BEAR IS THE BIG TERRESTRIAL ANIMAL IN MANY OF THESE HABITATS 
IF WE CAN'T PROTECT THAT WE'LL LOSE THE NEXT ONE DOWN 
THEN WE'LL LOSE THE NEXT ONE DOWN AND WE'LL END UP WITH A POORER SIMPLER ECOSYSTEM 
HOPEFULLY WITH INCREASING KNOWLEDGE WILL COME 
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE MIGHT TAKE BETTER CARE OF THIS 
THE ORIGINAL PADDINGTON BEAR 
NEXT WEEK ON NATURAL WORLD WE FOLLOW THE MAN 
TRYING TO CAPTURE THE WORLD'S FASTEST MOST ELUSIVE FISH ON CAMERA 
UNDERWATER ADVENTURE WITH SAILFISH SWORDFISH AND MARLIN 
TELL ME WHAT TO DO TO GET MY LIFE BACK 
LAST THING I REMEMBER IS THIS MAN WHAT MAN 
THE GUY WITH THE HORN RIMMED GLASSES 
HOW DOES IT END NOT WELL I'M AFRAID
