O. K. TWO OR THREE BEDROOMS WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT STYLE 
WELL I LIKE OLD 
RIGHT I LIKE THINGS WITH CHARACTER WEIRD THINGS FUNKY THINGS 
OLD BEAMS GIRDERS YEAH INTERESTING WINDOWS 
NOT NECESSARILY PERIOD PROPERTIES WINDMILLS I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT WEIRD ROOMS 
WEIRD SPACES LIKE AN OLD FACTORY 
OR I DON'T KNOW SOMETHING OLD WITH CHARACTER 
O. K. AND YOU WOULD LIKE 
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS A BIT OF WORK DOING TO IT 
I'D LIKE TO PUT OUR OWN TOUCH ON A PROPERTY 
HOP ON BOARD ALL RIGHT 
BIRMINGHAM HAS HAD HUGE REGENERATION 
THERE'S A LOT OF VERY MODERN TRENDY CHIC CITY LIVING APARTMENTS 
AND THAT'S THE LIFESTYLE I WOULD IMAGINE THAT YOU'D BE WANTING 
SO WHAT ABOUT THOSE MODERN APARTMENTS 
I WOULD BE HAPPY IN A MODERN APARTMENT WE CAN HAVE A LOOK 
BUT NOT COMMITTING YOU'RE OPEN TO QUITE A LOT THEN REALISTICALLY 
YEAH BRILLIANT 
HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED LEFT OVER FOR THE WEDDING 
I'LL ANSWER THAT THEN SHALL I 
WE'VE GOT A BUDGET OF AROUND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
RIGHT IF WE NEED TO STRETCH THAT WE CAN BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SOME TO 
BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND AND ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AROUND THERE

YES OR NO YES OR NO YES OR NO 
NO NO THANK YOU THANK YOU RIGHT WE'RE OFF ANYWAY 
WHAT A DEPRESSING END TO THE PROGRAMME IT'S GOING TO BE 
WE'LL GET MARRIED ED ALL RIGHT 
DEPRESSING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET MARRIED FOR US 
WAS VERY DEPRESSING BUT THE DAY'S STILL YOUNG 
WE'RE ONLY AT THE START WE CAN WORK ON THEM 
AND WE COULD ALWAYS GO TO AMSTERDAM YOU AND I AND GET A MARRIAGE DEAL SET UP 
IF THAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED I'M PREPARED TO DO IT 
I WANT A HAPPY BEGINNING MIDDLE AND ENDING SO WHY DON'T WE 
GO ON FIND THEM SOME LOVELY PROPERTIES GOOD IDEA 
SO BIRMINGHAM IS AT THE HEART OF TODAY'S SEARCH 
AND IT'S A CITY THAT'S BOOMING 
AS WELL AS BEING HOME TO OVER FORTY ONE THOUSAND COMPANIES 
BIRMINGHAM IS BECOMING ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING SHOPPING CAPITALS OF EUROPE 
CAFES AND RESTAURANTS HAVE SPRUNG UP ALONG THE CANAL SIDE DEVELOPMENTS 
MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO LIVE WORK AND PLAY HERE ALL AT ONCE 
AND WITH A POPULATION OF NEARLY A MILLION PEOPLE LIVING HERE 
THERE'S A MASSIVE DEMAND FOR CITY DWELLINGS 
AROUND FIVE THOUSAND NEW APARTMENTS HAVE GONE UP OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
ADDING TO THE CITY SKYSCAPE 
THE TROUBLE IS THAT HOUSE PRICES REFLECT THIS POPULARITY 
ON AVERAGE YOU CAN EXPECT TO PAY IN EXCESS OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND FOR A ONE BEDROOMED FLAT 
TO WELL OVER A MILLION FOR A PENTHOUSE APARTMENT 
SO FULFILLING ANNA AND DAVE'S HOPES OF A DREAM LIFESTYLE 
AND A DREAM HOME MAY PROVE PRICEY 
BUT I'M SURE WE'LL BE ABLE TO GIVE OUR FIRST TIME BUYERS A STEP UP ONTO THAT PROPERTY LADDER 
BUT JUST HOW FAR WILL ONE HUNDRED FIFTY GRAND GO IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT 
WELL IN EGGBOROUGH NORTH YORKSHIRE 
YOU COULD HAVE THIS MODERN SEMI DETACHED FAMILY HOME 
IT BOASTS A MASTER BEDROOM WITH AN EN SUITE AND TWO FURTHER BEDROOMS 
THERE'S A SPACIOUS KITCHEN AND DETACHED GARAGE 
ALL FOR THE TOP PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
IF YOU'RE AFTER SUN SEA AND SALTY AIR THEN THIS ONE BEDROOMED FLAT 
IN MINNIS BAY KENT MIGHT FIT THE BILL 
IT'S GOT A LARGE LOUNGE AREA WITH STUNNING SEA VIEW ALL FOR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
OR FINALLY HEAD FOR HECKMONDWIKE YORKSHIRE 
IF YOU WANT THIS MAGNIFICENT AND SPACIOUS TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT 
BEAUTIFULLY REFURBISHED YOU CAN BUY INTO A LITTLE PIECE OF HISTORY 
IF YOU HAVE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO SPARE 
OVER THE YEARS BIRMINGHAM HAS SUFFERED FROM AN IMAGE PROBLEM 
AND ITS CRITICS HAVE LAMPOONED IT FOR UGLY ARCHITECTURE 
AND SPAGHETTI JUNCTIONS BUT IF YOU EXPLORE THE CITY CENTRE ITSELF 
THERE ARE MANY GREEN SPACES AND SOME AWESOME ARCHITECTURE 
I HAVE TWO PEOPLE ONE IS FROM HOLLAND 
RIGHT AND ONE IS A GUY CALLED DAVE 
DO YOU HAVE MORAL ISSUES ABOUT MOVING PEOPLE INTO A HOUSE IF THEY AREN'T MARRIED 
I DON'T BUT I AM GETTING MARRIED IN TWO AND A HALF WEEKS REALLY 
HAVE YOU CHOSEN YOUR DRESS I HAVE 
I'VE GOT MY FINAL FITTING TODAY REALLY YES 
THEY SAY THEY'LL GO TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MAXIMUM O. K. 
THEY NEED TWO POSSIBLY THREE BEDROOMS 
IT'S VERY EASY TO THINK OF BIRMINGHAM AS JUST AN INDUSTRIAL CITY 
BUT AT ITS HEART IT'S ALWAYS BEEN FAMED FOR INNOVATION 
THIS IS A LOVELY THREE BED PROPERTY 
RIGHT COOL I'M SHOWING YOU THIS COS IT'S REALLY SPACIOUS 
THREE GOOD SIZED BEDROOMS AND IF THEY WANTED TO GET A LODGER THAT WOULD BE PERFECT 
WILL YOU ARRANGE SOME VIEWINGS FOR THEM 
YES ANY TIME THAT'S FINE BLESS YOU 
AND AS I'VE BEEN PONTIFICATING ABOUT ALL THE BENEFITS OF BIRMINGHAM CITY LIVING 
IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC IF WE COULD FIND ANNA AND DAVE SOMEWHERE LOVELY 
AND CHIC AND GLOSSY IN THIS AREA HERE 
HE TOLD ME TO MEET HIM BY A FLORAL NOAH'S ARK AND THERE YOU ARE 
LOOK AT THIS THIS IS LOVELY I DON'T LIE YOU SEE YEAH

I'VE BEEN TRAMPING AROUND BIRMINGHAM CITY CENTRE IN THE HOPE 
THAT I WOULD FIND A GLOSSY LITTLE APARTMENT

COOL 
I'M LIKING THE FLOORS REALLY LIKING THE FLOORS 
IT'S LIKE THEY'VE DONE A ONE DAY INTENSIVE LAWRENCE LLEWELLYN BOWEN DESIGN COURSE 
FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE REST OF THE COURSE AND GOT EXCITED AND DIDN'T LISTEN TO THE TECHNIQUES 
IT'S WORKED ON THESE PAIR 
IT'S A GOOD SPACE FOR A LIVING ROOM ISN'T IT 
IT'S KIND OF A LIVING ROOM 
WITH SPACE FOR A DINING TABLE THAT'S NICE 
ALSO THE WINDOWS PROBABLY NEED SOME WORK ON THAT SIDE LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
YEAH IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S BEEN DOING IT UP 
BUT IT STILL NEEDS TO BE FINISHED OFF JUST A LITTLE BIT YEAH YEAH 
COULD YOU DO THAT OR YOUR DAD WE COULD DO THAT YEAH 
PEOPLE FROM THE NETHERLANDS ARE DESIGN ORIENTATED

OLD FASHIONED SINK 
THIS IS COOL BUT IT'S A BIT TOO IT IS A LITTLE

OH IT'S KIND OF A KITCHEN UTILITY THING THAT'S HUGE 
AH THEN IT IS QUITE SPACIOUS ISN'T IT IT'S VERY SPACIOUS 
I'M LIKING IT YEAH 
I WONDER IF THEY'LL PICK UP ON THE FACT THAT THE BANISTER 
AND SPINDLES AND NEWEL POST ARE ALL NEW THEY MIGHT 
BIT OF A NARROW STAIRCASE ISN'T IT 
YEAH NOTHING TO HOLD ON TO NO BE CAREFUL WHEN WE COME HOME DRUNK 
NOT THAT THAT HAPPENS OFTEN 
THIS IS INTERESTING 
AH RIGHT EXCELLENT 
I LIKE THE WHOLE WOOD AND YEAH IT'S GOOD 
WOOD AND KIND OF WHITISH DECORATION 
IT LOOKS AS IF THEY'VE TAKEN THE PAINT OFF EVERYTHING 
AND NOT PUT THE DOOR HANDLES BACK ON 
THAT'S FINE WE CAN DO THAT WE CAN DO THAT 
WE CAN PRETEND LIKE WE'RE STARS OF DIY BY PUTTING DOOR KNOBS ON 
COOL LIGHTING AGAIN THIS WOULD BE A PERFECT SPARE ROOM GOOD SIZE 
YOU COULD SQUEEZE A DOUBLE BED IN THE END YEAH 
IF YOU SQUEEZED A DOUBLE BED IN 
WOULD YOUR MATTRESS WOULD BE ALL RUCKLED 
IF YOU CONTINUE TO KEEP SQUEEZING IT YES 
LOOK AT THEM PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT OUR WEDDING AGAIN YEAH PROBABLY 
IF WE BUY A HOUSE LIKE THIS WE CAN'T AFFORD A WEDDING 
THAT'S TRUE YEAH BETTER BE CHEAP 
THIS LOOKS VERY LIGHT LOOK AT THE SINK LIGHT AIRY 
I LIKE THE WOOD AND WHITE 
NOW THIS BATHROOM I WOULD SAY IS PRETTY DECADENT 
IT HAS MARBLE FLOORING IT IS THAT 
MASTER BEDROOM THAT WALLPAPER IS OUTRAGEOUS 
NO IT'S NOT OUTRAGEOUS IT'S GORGEOUS OH GOOD GOD 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO RIP THAT OUT 
I DON'T THINK I'VE GOT MUCH CHOICE FROM THAT REACTION 
I THINK IT'S GREAT WOW GREAT ROOM 
I LIKE THE WAY THEY'VE LINKED THE WALLPAPER WITH THAT GOLD LAME BEDSPREAD IT DOES WORK AS A THEME 
WHEN YOU WERE A DESIGNER WHAT WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MOROC 
HELL 
COCKTAIL LOUNGE OPULENCE BEDROOM DRAMA 
LOOK AT THE RADIATOR 
YEAH WHAT IS IT 
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE SMASHED OFF PART OF THE PAINT 
THAT COULD BE REALLY REALLY NICE 
BUT THE BASICS ARE GOOD LIKE THE CEILING AND THE WALLS 
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'VE MOVED IN ALREADY 
KRISTIAN I FEEL WE HAVE NOT JUST A HIT ON OUR HANDS HERE WE HAVE 
A POSSIBLE WEDDING YES YES 
ANNA YOU SEEMED TO LIKE THAT HOUSE 
I DO YES IT'S GREAT GOOD 
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THE INTERIOR LET'S TALK ABOUT THE EXTERIOR LOVELY GARDEN 
BUT YOU DON'T SEEM THAT EXCITED ABOUT GARDENS 
WELL I DO LIKE SITTING OUTSIDE 
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING FOR DAVE 
COS HE CAN GROW HIS VEGETABLES AND HERBS 
BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS STUFF ABOUT GARDENS 
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT PLANT 
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT PLANT 
JASMINE ACER WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT TREE THERE 
EASY EASY GO EASY 
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THOSE ARE PEARS HANGING OFF IT IT'S A PEAR TREE 
I WAS GOING TO GET YOU EXCITED ABOUT THE GARDEN BUT THERE'S NO POINT 
THEREFORE I'LL TALK TO YOU ABOUT INTERNAL SPACE 
AND GETTING MORE OF IT O. K. 
SEE UP THERE YOUR NEIGHBOUR HAS A HUGE DORMER EXTENSION ON THE ROOF UP THERE THEY DO 
YOU COULD DO THE SAME COS THEY'VE SET A PRECEDENT 
BUT I WOULD GET A STRUCTURAL SURVEYOR TO MAKE SURE 
FIND OUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO BEAMS 
AND GET AN ARCHITECT TO DRAW UP THE PLANS 
DAVE'S UNCLE'S AN ARCHITECT SO HE CAN DO IT FOR US 
REALLY YEAH THAT'S VERY VERY GOOD 
IT'S A GOOD FAMILY TO POSSIBLY MARRY INTO ISN'T IT I'M THINKING IT IS 
AND YOU COULD GROW ROSES FOR THE WEDDING IN THE GARDEN 
DO YOU SEE HOW THIS IS WORKING YES I DO SEE IT 
COME ON LET'S GO AND SPEAK TO THE BOYS 
THEY'VE CONVERTED THIS BUT THEY ONLY HALF CONVERTED IT 
SO REALLY IT STILL NEEDS WORK DOING 
WHAT YOU COULD DO IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME 
IN THEORY IF YOU WERE A WORKER AND ANNA I FEEL WILL PUT YOU TO WORK 
I HAVE THE FEELING I'M GOING TO BE SPENDING MOST WEEKENDS SORTING THIS PLACE OUT 
YOU COULD AT THE END HERE POP A PATIO DOOR THERE 
AND SOME OF YOUR FRENCH DOORS YOU SWING OUT 
THAT'S TURNING THIS TO A KIND OF BREAKFAST DINE Y. KIND OF AREA 
WHICH IS THE ENVY OF THE MODERN WORLD THESE DAYS 
A NICE PATIO LEADING OUT TO THE GARDEN 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN YEAH DO YOU LIKE THE IDEA YEAH 
THE QUESTION IS IS THE MONEY RIGHT RIGHT O. K. 
COS IF THE MONEY'S RIGHT IT'S DING DONG MARRIAGE TIME 
IF THE MONEY'S TOO MUCH I CAN'T AFFORD A WEDDING 
DON'T GET ANY NERVES JUST GO STRAIGHT FOR IT 
YOU'D BOTH BETTER SIT DOWN FOR THIS ONE ALL RIGHT GOOD YEAH 
I THINK ANNA WOULD LIKE TO ASK DAVE A QUESTION 
REALLY ON ON 
ANNA GO ON AS YOU SAID THAT'S IT WELL DONE 
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR SIX YEARS NOW I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH 
THIS IS GREAT WILL YOU REPLACE ALL THE ROTTEN WINDOWS IN THIS HOUSE 
I'M NOT READY FOR THAT COMMITMENT 
OH DAVE I TOLD YOU IT WAS IN THE EYES DARLING 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE MORE MEANINGFUL AND GRAB THE KNEE AS YOU DO IT WE TRIED WE TRIED ED WE FAILED 
O. K. ROTTEN WINDOWS AND MARRIAGE PROPOSALS TO ONE SIDE 
IT IS GUESS THE PRICE TIME ANNA YOU CAN GO FIRST WHAT DO YOU THINK GIVE ME A PRICE 
IT HAS TWO BEDROOMS AND A GARDEN 
IT NEEDS SOME WORK I WILL SAY ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
OH INTERESTING CRAFTY 
O. K. DAVE RIGHT I WOULD SAY IT'S 
IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK DOING TO IT NOTHING STRUCTURAL 
BUT STILL SOME WORK SO I WOULD GO ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO THOUSAND 
O. K. OBVIOUSLY YOUR MAXIMUM BUDGET WAS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
IT IS FIFTY SHORT OF YOUR MAXIMUM BUDGET WHICH MEANS ANNA HAS WON 
DOES PUT IT OVER THE PRICES YOU GUESSED AT BUT IT'S WITHIN BUDGET AND IT'S AN ENTIRE HOUSE 
WE'RE JUST BEING AMBITIOUS WITH THESE GUESSES WELL 
I WOULD SAY JUST THINK HOPELESS ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY IT MIGHT BE OVER PRICED YOU KNOW 
THERE ARE THINGS TO DO IN THERE AND THE WINDOWS DO NEED REPLACING 
DAVE'S NOT THE MAN FOR THAT WE KNOW THAT NOW 
BUT WE HAVE KRISTIAN'S PROPERTY AND WE HAVE THE WILD CARD WHICH WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO NEXT 
SEE MINE 
COME AND SEE MINE KRISTIAN'S LET'S GO FOR IT 
SO ON TO THE SECOND STOP OF OUR HOUSE HUNT TODAY AND MY SUGGESTION

THIS MID VICTORIAN TERRACE PROPERTY IS FULL OF PROMISE 
O. K. DAVE AND ANNA HERE WE ARE PROPERTY NUMBER TWO MY CHOICE AND I HAVE ONE VERY PERTINENT QUESTION

LOOKS VERY NEW 
VERY NEW INDEED 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT EVER IT'S NEVER BEEN LIVED IN 
NO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYONE'S EVER COOKED IN THIS 
I THINK THAT'S A VERY NICE GALLEY STYLE KITCHEN 
THAT'S MORE LIKE A SHIP KITCHEN 
LOTS OF STORAGE ROOM 
LOADS OF STORAGE YEAH 
IS IT A BATHROOM OH IT'S THAT SHOWER 
THAT'S THE SHOWER WHAT'S THAT OH THIS IS THE FUNKY SHOWER 
IF THE SHOWER DOESN'T PULL IT OFF YES IT AIN'T HAPPENING NO 
IT'S ALL IN THE SHOWER ACE UP THE SLEEVE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
OH WOW THAT'S A HUGE SHOWERHEAD 
WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT THE SHOWER SCENARIO IS THE ENTRANCE INTO IT IS QUITE NARROW 
YOU ALMOST HAVE TO GO SIDEWAYS IN AS IF YOU WERE A CRAB 
IT'S HARD TO GET INTO I WONDER IF THERE'S A BATHROOM UPSTAIRS 
THIS CAN'T BE THE ONLY BATHROOM 
HEY IT'S VERY TIDY UPSTAIRS 
OH THAT'S ME BEING ANNA I THOUGHT YOU WERE BEING DIRK BOGARDE IT'S VERY TIDY UPSTAIRS 
IT'S TIGHT AS A TIGER UPSTAIRS PLAY IT AGAIN 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN CARPETED 
ALL NEW STUFF BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS YEAH IT'S VERY TIDY 
IT'S ALL NEWLY DONE 
IN HERE 
WOW IT'S BIG ISN'T IT THIS IS BIG I LIKE THE FLOOR 
DO YOUR DUTCH IMPRESSION AGAIN 
IT'S VERY TIGHT UPSTAIRS 
NOW WHY DON'T YOU SAY COME UP AND SEE ME SOMETIME COS THAT'S NOT DUTCH 
WELL THAT'S WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE 
IT'S A GOOD SPACE VERY GOOD SPACE YEAH NICE BIG WINDOW 
IT'S LIKE THEY HAVE DONE ALL THE WORK DOWNSTAIRS BUT NOT UP HERE 
BUT IT DOES HAVE MORE CHARACTER UP HERE 
DO YOU HAVE TO BE 
SOMEONE'S EATEN A BIT TOO MUCH LUNCH HAVEN'T THEY HEY 
BREAKING THE CHAIRS HEAR A CRICKING CHAIR MAKE REFERENCE TO MY WEIGHT 
THAT'S A VERY GOOD SIZE ROOM VERY LIGHT NICELY DONE 
LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE A HOTEL ROOM 
I HAD THAT FEELING DOWNSTAIRS YEAH IT'S SO DONE UP IT'S NEARLY 
IT'S PRISTINE ISN'T IT IT'S ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS IN THIS HOUSE 
YOU'VE GOT THE LITTLE CHROME DOWN LIGHTERS 
THE NICELY PAINTED SKIRTING BOARD IT'S ALL VERY VERY SMART 
MORE CHROME IN MY HOUSE THOUGH ISN'T THERE 
THAT WAS JUST THE WALLPAPER WASN'T IT 
AHH IS IT THREE BEDROOMS WOULD YOU 
OR TWO BEDROOMS AND A SPARE 
THIS LOOKS LIKE A BABY ROOM KRISTIAN AND ED 
THEY'RE MAKING PLANS FOR US 
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THAT ROOM WHAT THAT EXTRA ROOM THAT EXTRA BIT 
I WOULD PLACE A CHILD IN THERE AFTER I'D GOT MARRIED 
BUT YOU HAVE TO GET THROUGH THE MASTER BEDROOM TO GET HERE AHH YES 
SO MAYBE AN OFFICE OR SOMETHING STUDY OR STORAGE FOR YOUR SHOES 
MY SHOES WOULD LIKE IT HERE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THIS HOUSE HAS DONE 
I THINK IT'S BROUGHT THEM CLOSE TOGETHER IN THEIR KIND OF MEDIOCRE RESPONSE TO THE PROPERTY 
OR UNITED HATRED OF IT EITHER WAY YOU'RE RIGHT YES 
SHALL WE GO TALK TO THEM WHY NOT 
ANNA 
YES WHEN YOU WALKED INTO THIS ROOM YOU SAID IT LOOKED LIKE A BOAT YES CAPTAIN 
YOU'RE SO CHEEKY 
WHY WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE A BOAT 
BECAUSE THE WOOD UP TO HERE AND THEN THESE THINGS ON EITHER SIDE 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF TONGUE AND GROVE CLADDING ISN'T IT 
IT IS WE CAN TAKE IT OFF DOESN'T FEEL NAUTICAL 
I KNOW THAT YOU LIKE OPEN PLAN LIVING 
YEAH WHAT I WAS THINKING IT'S QUITE RADICAL AND IT REQUIRES A LOT OF WORK 
BUT IT MIGHT BE WORTH THE EFFORT IS DEMOLISHING THAT WALL 
BUT ISN'T THAT THE STAIRCASE HERE AND THE 
YES IT IS THE STAIRCASE BEHIND THERE 
YOU DEMOLISH THIS WALL IT'S A LOAD BEARING WALL SO YOU'LL NEED TO PUT THINGS UP 
TO HOLD THE HOUSE TOGETHER 
BUT THEN YOU BASICALLY HAVE OPEN TREAD STAIRCASE AND THE ILLUSION IS A LOT MORE SPACE YES 
YOU SEE RIGHT TO THE END OF THE HOUSE 
YES WELL THAT COULD WORK 
I'M NOT VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS HOUSE YOU'RE NOT NO 
I FEEL LIKE I'VE LOST ANNA SOMEWHERE 
BECAUSE IT'S SO PRIM AND PROPER AND IT DOESN'T FEEL FUNKY OR CITY LIVING AT ALL 
YOU'RE NOT FEELING KIND OF INVIGORATED 
NO NO O. K. YOU READY 
YEAH RIGHT GUESS THE PRICE 
RIGHT DAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THE OLD GAFF 
DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM YEAH 
NOW OBVIOUSLY MY SOLUTION IS THIS POP IT UPSTAIRS 
IN THAT SPARE ROOM YES YES 
BUT OF COURSE I CAN'T FORCE YOU TO HAVE CHILDREN YET 
I CAN'T EVEN GET YOU TO GET MARRIED TO THE WOMAN YOU LOVE 
SO THIS BECOMES UP THERE AND THEN THIS WILL SOUND LIKE I'M A PATIO DOOR SALESMAN HERE 
COS IT WAS MY TIP IN THE LAST ONE BUT SO ONCE YOU'VE TAKEN THIS OUT 
YOU THEN GET THE LOVELY KITCHEN DINER THAT EVERYONE DREAMS OF 
AND YOU GET THE UPSTAIRS BATHROOM THAT EVERYONE WANTS 
CERTAINLY A GOOD IDEA FOR THIS ONE IN THEORY THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA 
SO YOU WOULD THEN GET TO ENJOY THIS PART OF THE GARDEN

IT'S GOT OUR FAVOURITE RESTAURANT AND PUBS AND CLUBS VERY NICE 
WE'RE SHOWING YOU THIS TIME I DON'T WANT TO DESTROY IT TOO MUCH THE SURPRISE 
BUT THE REASON WHY IT'S THE WILD CARD IS BECAUSE WE'RE SHOWING SOMETHING NEW NOT SOMETHING OLD 
AND FOR ME THE RATHER EXCITING PART OF THIS IS WE'RE IN THE JEWELLERY QUARTER 
FAMED FOR MAKING JEWELLERY 
THEREFORE A NICE PLACE THAT YOU COULD BUY WEDDING RINGS 
NOW WE'VE GOT A CHOICE 
WE CAN EITHER SEND YOU IN THERE OR FORGET ABOUT IT AND GO AND BUY RINGS NO LET'S DO THE HOUSE 
LET'S DO THE HOUSE FIRST SHALL WE REALLY YEAH ARE YOU SURE 
YOU DON'T WANT A LOVELY LITTLE RING 
YOU CAN GO RING SHOPPING WE'LL GO INTO THE HOUSE GO IN AND THEN JUST WANDER AROUND

SPACIOUS ISN'T IT YEAH IT'S BIG

HAVE AN OFFICE OR SOMETHING YEAH 
WELL QUITE IMPRESSIVE VERY NICE 
YEAH ONE OF THESE RINGS HERE OR TWO OF THOSE RINGS EITHER SIDE PLACED ON THE BEDSIDE CABINETS

RIGHT WHAT I NEED TO TELL YOU IS AT THE BACK WHERE THE KITCHEN IS THE ROOF IS ACTUALLY ASBESTOS
