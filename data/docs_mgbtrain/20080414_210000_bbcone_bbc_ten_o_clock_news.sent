REPORT FROM BEIJING ALSO TONIGHT

BERLUSCONI IS POISED TO RETURN AS 
ITALY'S PRIME MINISTER 
DEATH AND DESTRUCTION WILL PASS 
UPON YOU 
THE SO CALLED MARTYRDOM 
VIDEOS SHOWN TO A JURY TRYING EIGHT 
MEFPB PLOTTING TERROR ATTACKS 
AND A MAJOR SLIP UP BY CHELSEA IN 
TONIGHT'S RACE FOR THE PREMIERSHIP 
TITLE 
ON B. B. C. LONDON UNDER INVESTIGATION 
THE PAT AMERICANTY UNIT WHERE THREE 
MOTHERS DIED IN THE LAST TEN MONTHS 
AND COT MAYORAL BATTLE BE WON OR 
LOST BY CAMPAIGNS IN CYBERSPACE 
GOOD EVENING CHINA HAS OVERTAKEN 
THE UNITED STATES AS THE WORLD'S 
BIGGEST POLLUTER ACCORDING TO A 
REPORT SEEN BY THE TEN O'CLOCK NEWS 
AND DUE TO BE PUBLISHED NEXT MONTH 
OVER THE PAST DECADE CHINA'S 
ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS PRODUCED A 
STARTLING INCREASE IN CARBON 
DIOXIDE EMISSIONS AND THE REPORT 
WARNS UNLESS THERE'S A RADICAL 
CHANGE OF POLICY EMISSIONS WILL 
SIMPLY GO ON RISING OUR CHINA 
CORRESPONDENT HAS THE STORY 
IN THE CITY OF TAUAN THE POLLUTION 
IS SO BAD YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
HIDE OUT HERE FOR YEARS WITHOUT 
ANYBODY FINDING YOU ON A STREET 
BELOW YOU CAN SEE A HANDFUL OF 
PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH THE SMOG 
THE B. B. C. HAS LEARNED THAT THEIR 
COUNTRY MAY NOW BE THE WORLD'S 
BIGGEST CARBON EMITR THROUGH THE 
EMITER THROUGH THE CITY'S HAZE 
YOU CAN MAKE OUT SOME APARTMENT 
BLOCKS BLOCKS INSIDE ONE WE MEET PLZ HU SHE'S A 
HOUSEWIFE HOUSEWIFE SHE SHOWS ME WHERE SHE WANTS TO PUT 
A NEWARK MACHINE JUST UNDER THE 
COUNTER HER AMBITIONS ARE CHANGE 
OUR WORLD HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF 
CHINESE PEOPLE LIKE HER WANT A 
BETTER LIFE WITH THE THINGS WE HAVE 
AT HOME IN THE WEST 
THIS IS HOW CHINA GIVES MRS. HU WHAT 
SHE WANTS WHEREVER YOU LOOK IN THE 
CITY YOU CAN FIND A COAL FIRED 
POWER STATION SENDING CARBON INTO 
THE AIR CHINA'S BUILDING AROUND 
TWO NEW POWER STATIONS EVERY WEEK 
TO MEET ITS GROWING DEMAND AND 
IT'S ALL ADDING UP ONE AGENCY SAYS 
THAT CHINA PRODUCED SIXTY TWO BILLION 
TONNES OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN TWOUKS 
SIX TWO THOUSAND SIX MORE THEN TEN TIMES 
AS MUCH AS THE U. K. IT'S ENOUGH FOR 
ONE OF BRITAIN'S LEADING 
ENVIRONMENTAL FORECASTERS TO GIVE 
HIS DRAMATIC CONKLUKS 
IN TERMS OF 
CARBON EMISSIONS IT SEEMS THE 
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA HAS 
RECENTLY OVERTAKEN THE UNITED 
STATES AS THE LEADING EMITER OF 
THAT POLLUTION THAT'S A POSITION 
THE UNITED STATES HAS HELD SINCE 
THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
BUT CHINA'S 
DEFENCE IS SIMPLE YOU HAVE TO 
COUNT CARBON PER HEAD NOT PER 
COUNTRY AND THERE ARE MORE HEAD IN 
CHINA THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE 
WORLD THIRTEEN BILLION OF THEM SOME 
ARE HAVING LUNCH HERE AT THIS 
RESTAURANT IN BEIJING 
THIS IS HOW CHINA LIKES TO DEFEND 
ITS POSITION THE AVERAGE CHINESE 
PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR JUST 
THREE AND A HALF TONNES OF CARBON A 
YEAR SO WE REPRESENT THAT HERE 
WITH ONE BOWL OF RICE BUT THE 
AVERAGE WESTERNER IS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THREE TIMES AS MUCH CARBON SO 
WE REPRESENT THAT WITH THREE BOWLS 
OF RICE AND CHINA'S PUNCH LINE IS 
THIS IT'S THE WESTERNER WHO NEEDS 
TO CUT DOWN AND GO ON A CARBON DIET 
NOT THE AVERAGE CHINESE MR. AND MRS. 
TANG BELIEVE THE WEST IS TO BLAME 
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN 
POLLUTING FOR TWO HUNDRED OR MORE YEARS 
THAN WE HAVE THINK THEY SHOULD 
TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY IT'S 
UNFAIR TO ASK CHINA CHINA TO PAY 
THE PRICE 
BECAUSE OF THIS CHINA 
WON'T ACCEPT ANY LIMITS ON ITS OWN 
EMISSIONS HERE IT BRINGS IN COAL 
FROM ABROAD THIS COUNTRY INSISTS 
THAT ITS PEOPLE HAVE THE ABSOLUTE 
MORAL RIGHT TO LIVE AS WE DO IN THE 
WEST TO CONSUME AS MUCH CARBON AS 
US SO HERE'S THE THE FINAL 
PROBLEM IF THE CHINESE GO ON TO 
LIVE AS WE DO THE WORLD MAY NOT 
COOL DOWN 
AND WATCHING THAT WITH ME IS OUR 
ENVIRONMENT MEANT ANALYST YOU'VE 
STUDIED THIS REPORT FOR YOU WHAT 
IS ITS MAIN SIGNIFICANCE 
THE MAIN 
SIGNIFICANCE IS NOT THAT CHINA HAS 
BECOME OR BECOMING THE NUMBER ONE 
POLLUTER THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN 
ANYWAY WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT IS THE 
FUTURE PROJECTIONS FOR THEIR 
EMISSION WHICH IF YOU WERE WORRIED 
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH MANY 
SCIENTISTS ARE ARE TRULY SCARY 
THIS REPORT SUGGESTS IN THE FUTURE 
CHINA'S EMISSIONS GROWTH WILL BE 
SEVERAL TIMES MORE THAN THE CUTS 
IMPOSED BY WESTERN COUNTRIES TRYING 
TO IMPOSE THE KYOTO PROTOCOL SO 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR GLOBAL 
NEGOTIATIONS WELL THE NEXT UNITED 
STATES PRESIDENT WILL SIGN UP TO A 
DEAL TO CUT EMISSIONS GLOBALLY AND 
IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ONLY ON 
CONDITION THAT CHINA AND INDIA SIGN 
UP TOO AND YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE 
FILM THAT CHINA AND INDIA TOO SAY 
LOOK THIS IS A RICH WORLD PROBLEM 
WE'RE PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF 
POVERTY THE RESEARCHER WHO HAS 
DONE THIS PIECE TONIGHT SAYS THE 
ONLY SOLUTION IS FOR THE RICH 
COUNTRIES FOR US AND THE UNITED 
STATES TO PAY THE POORER COUNTRIES 
TO DEVELOP MORE CLEANLY BUT THE 
UNITED STATES AT THE MOMENT HAS NO 
INTEREST IN THAT WHATSOEVER WE'RE 
SUPPOSED TO HAVE A NEW GLOBAL DEAL 
IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS AND IT'S 
I WAS ASLEEP AS WERE MOST OF THE 
PEOPLE ON THE BUS 
I JUST REMEMBER A BIG BANG AND LIKE 
THE WHOLE BUS SHOOK AND HE 
EVERYTHING STOPPED 
THE LORRY THAT 
HIT THE TOUR BUS KILLED THE FOUR 
STUDENTS AND GUIDE INSTANTLY IT IS 
THOUGHT THE DRIVER FLED THIS SCENE 
OF CARNAGEMENT AN INVESTIGATION HAS 
BEEN STARTED ONE EYEWITNESS 
CLAIMED A 
TYRE BURST 
ON THE TRUCK 
MOMENTS BEFORE THE DEVASTATING 
IMPACT IN AMONGST THIS GROUP 
STUDENTS IS ELIZABETH PINCOCK WITH 
HER 
FRIENDS IN TAUNTON A TALENTED 
HER FRIENDS IN TAUNTON A TALENTED PUPIL WITH A 
BRIGHT FUTURE 
SHE ALWAYS ALWAYS SPENT 
A LOT 
OF TIME 
FOR 
FOR OTHER PEOPLE SHE ALSO HAD THE EFFECT OF 
ME AND ON 
SOME OF HER 
FRIENDS SHE BROUGHT OTHER PEOPLE 
UP AROUND HER IF YOU WERE DOWN WONDERING 
ABOUT YOURSELF 
SHE WOULD 
BE THAT ONE THAT 
WOULD GIVE 
YOU 
PAT 
PAT ON THE BACK AND GIVE YOU THE GET UP AND GO YOU NEEDED 
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A RITE OF 
PASSAGE FOR THESE YOUNG WOMEN BUT 
THEIR LIVES WERE CUT SHORT SOME OF 
THE OF THE SURVIVORS HAVE BEEN 
GIVING A NEWS CONFERENCE ANDY 
WHAT'S BEEN SAID 
WELL EIGHT OF 
THOSE SURVIVING STUDENTS ARE GIVING 
A PRESS CONFERENCE AND I'VE SPOKEN 
TO THE BRITISH CONSUL WHO SAY ALL 
TWELVE ARE SUFFERING FROM CUTS AND 
BRUISES BUT IT'S THEIR MENTAL STATE 
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT HE SAID HE 
WANTS TO KEEP THEM IN A GROUP AND 
THEY'RE SUPPORTING EACH OTHER AND 
SHOULD BE RETURNING HOME TO THE U. K. 
SOMETIME TOMORROW EVENING YOU CAN 
SEE MORE COVERAGE HERE IN QUITO 
LATER ON NEWS TWENTY FOUR 
IN ITALY SILVIO BERLUSCONI IS 
POISED TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER FOR 
A THIRD TIME THE FINAL RESULTS IN 
THE COUNTRY'S GENERAL ELECTION ARE 
STILL NOT FULLY DECLARED BUT THE 
CENTRE LEFT LEADER WALTER VELTRONI 
HAS CONGRATULATED SILVIO BERLUSCONI 
AND HIS PEOPLE'S FREEDOM PARTY ON 
THEIR VICTORY 
VOTES ARE STILL BEING COUNTED HERE 
BUT WE DO HAVE LOOK AT OFFICIAL 
FIGURES AND THEY'VE STRONGLY 
SUGGEST THAT MR. BERLUSCONI HAS WON 
A DECISIVE VICTORY IT APPEARS TO 
BE NINE AND TEN POINTS AHEAD IN 
BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT IT'S AN 
AMAZING RETURN FOR A VERY VERY 
COLOURFUL POLITICAL FIGURE 
NOT EXACTLY A SHY MAN MR. 
BERLUSCONI HASN'T APPEARED IN 
PUBLIC SINCE HIS VICTORY CONTENT 
TO PHONE THE STATE BROADCASTERS TO 
TELL THEM THERE WOULD BE DIFFICULT 
MONTHS AHEAD AND TO SEND AN 
AFFECTIONATE KISS TO ALL ITALIANS 
BEFORE HE WENT INTO POLITICS HE 
WAS ALREADY A HUGELY SUCCESSFUL 
BUSINESSMAN OWNER OF A. C. MILAN AND 
A MEDIA EMPIRE TODAY HE'S WORTH 
MORE THAN FIVE BILLION WHEN HE WASPM 
BEFORE HE WAS WHEN HE WAS P. M. HE 
WAS ALWAYS DROPPING WHAT SOME 
CONSIDERED AS CLANGERS HE CAUSED 
AMUSEMENT APPEARING ON HOLIDAY WITH 
TONY BLAIR WEARING A BANDANA 
PROBABLY COVERING UP HAIR 
TRANSPLANT HE'S COMPARED HIMSELF 
TO NAPOLEON AND JESUS CHRIST IN 
THIS ELECTION HE'S CALMED DOWN A 
BIT BIT HE ALSO TOLD WOMAN COMPLAINING OF 
POVERTY SHE SHOULD HAVE MARRIED HIS 
RICH SON BUT IT'S NOT QUESTIONABLE 
HUMOUR THAT WORRIES SOME BUT THE 
FACT THAT HE'S BEEN PROSECUTED SIX 
TIMES FOR CORRUPTION ALTHOUGH 
ALWAYS ACQUITTED AND ALWAYS DENYING 
ANY WRONG DOING AND THAT HE 
DOMINATES THE ITALIAN MEDIA 
ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING IS APPEARS 
THAT ITALIANS HAVE NOT ONLY VOTED 
FOR MR. BERLUSCONI BUT ALSO FOR A 
SIMPLER SYSTEM THERE'LL BE NO HARD 
LEFT NO COMMUNISTS ACCORDING TO 
THE PROJECTIONS MEANING ONLY SIX 
PARTIES IN THE PARLIAMENT AND 
THAT'S QUITE DIFFERENT SORT OF POLITICS FOR ITALY 
THE HIGH COURT IN ZIMBABWE HAS 
REJECTED BID BY THE OPPOSITION TO 
ORDER THE RELEASE OF THE RESULTS OF 
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TWO

DIDN'T HAVE NO CHANCE OF DOING THIS 
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MEANS TANVIR TANVIR HUSSEIN IS ALSO FROM EAST LONDON

I ONLY WISH I COULD COME BACK AND 
DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL PEOPLE

THE RATE OF INFLATION FOR 
SENIOR LABOUR M. P. HAS ADMITTED THAT 
PEOPLE ARE DISAPPOINTED WITH GORDON 
BROWN'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 
YOU TAKE A SLOWING ECONOMY AND ADD 
IN PRETTY ATROCIOUS OPINION POLL 
RESULTS AND 
ALSO THROW IN 
THREAT OF THE IMMINENT TEST OF THE

THERE ARE GROWING 
SIGNS THAT THE 
HOPES 
AND EXPECTATION THAT 
IS 
BROWN 
RAISED WHEN 
HE 
LAST SUMMER 
ARE BEGINNING 
TO FADE 
AT LEAST AMONG 
SOME LABOUR M. P.'S 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PEOPLE'S 
EXPECTATIONS WERE EXTREMELY WHEN 
GORDON BECAME 
PRIME MINISTER 
WHEN GORDON BECAME PRIME MINISTER IT IS 
THOSE HIGH 
EXPECTATIONS NOT 
IT IS THOSE HIGH EXPECTATIONS NOT BEING REALISED 
DISAPPOINTED PEOPLE

EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE THAT

THEY HAVE 
LOST FAITH 
IN GORDON 
BROWN'S ABILITY 
TO MANAGE 
BRITISH 
ECONOMY AND 
LOST 
TRUST IN 
BRITISH ECONOMY AND LOST TRUST IN HIS GOVERNMENT THE POLLS DON'T 
LOOK GOOD 
TODAY THAT SIXTY EIGHT PER CENT OF

CRISIS OTHERS 
PERSONAL 
RATINGS HAVE 
PLUNGED 
FASTER THAN 
ANY MODERN 
PRIME MINISTER GORDON BROWN 
HAS 
TOUCH WITH 
THE EVERY
