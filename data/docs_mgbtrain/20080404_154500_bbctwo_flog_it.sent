WE'RE IN HISTORIC CHIPPENHAM IN WILTSHIRE 
WHICH HAS BEEN A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK FOR THE LAST SIX THOUSAND YEARS 
SO THERE DEFINITELY SHOULD BE NO SHORTAGE OF PROVENANCE TODAY ON FLOG IT 
THE CROWD HAVE COME TO THE NEELD HALL 
WITH THEIR ANTIQUES AND COLLECTABLES 
HOPING TO DISCOVER THEIR VALUE FROM OUR EXPERTS 
AND WHEN I SAY CROWD 
I REALLY DO MEAN A CROWD TAKE A LOOK AT THE LENGTH OF THIS QUEUE 
AND ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THOSE UNDISCOVERED TREASURES ARE OUR TWO EXPERTS 
CATHERINE SOUTHON AND DAVID BARBY 
ONCE THE ITEMS HAVE BEEN VALUED 
IF OUR OWNERS AGREE WITH THE PRICE AND THEY WANT TO FLOG THE ITEM 
THEN WE'LL BRING THEM TO THE JUBILEE AUCTION ROOMS IN PEWSEY 
WELL OUR CONTENDERS ARE IN POSITION 
EAGER TO SEE IF THEIR ANTIQUES AND COLLECTABLES WILL BE GOING OFF TO AUCTION 
SO LET'S SEE WHAT DAVID'S FOUND FOR HIS FIRST ITEM 
WELL TREVOR I HOPE WHAT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU TODAY ABOUT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A LOAD OF BULL 
BUT YOU DO GET A LOT OF BULL FOR YOU MONEY IN THIS FIGURE DON'T YOU 
I WOULD DO IF I HAD THE HORNS ON IT STILL I KNOW THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
BUT THIS HAS BEEN ON VIEW TO PEOPLE IN CHIPPENHAM 
FOR THE LAST THIRTY FORTY MAYBE FIFTY YEARS YEAH 
AND IT CAME FROM A BUTCHER'S SHOP TELL ME ABOUT IT 
THE BUTCHER LIVED ON THE CORNER OF SHELDON AND LADYFIELD ROAD 
HIS NAME WAS STAN STACEY AND THAT WAS WHERE HIS BUSINESS WAS YES 
HOW DID YOU GET THIS 
A FRIEND OF MINE HE WAS A MANAGER OF A LOCAL DO IT YOURSELF STORE 
BOUGHT IT FROM STAN STACEY AS HE CLOSED THE SHOP DOWN 
RIGHT AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BUY THIS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS FROM MY FRIEND AND COULDN'T BUY IT 
HE WANTED HE KEPT IT ALL THAT TIME HE LIKED IT SO MUCH 
SO WHAT WAS YOUR INTEREST IN CATTLE 
WELL I HAD A SMALL HOLDING AT STANTON 
AND I BRED WITH A HEREFORD BULL AND I HAD TWENTY HEREFORD CATTLE 
AND I JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH THE BULL 
SO WHY ARE YOU PARTING WITH IT 
WELL I'VE HAD IT FOR FIVE YEARS AND MY WIFE THINKS IT'S BLOODY HORRIBLE 
THAT'S ALWAYS THE REASON CHAPS WANT TO SELL THINGS 
SO THE ONLY PLACE I CAN KEEP IT IS IN THE BEDROOM RIGHT 
I'D RATHER NOT COMMENT ON THAT I'M SLEEPING IN A DIFFERENT ROOM 
THIS IS AN INTERESTING PIECE OF POTTERY 
WHEN I FIRST SAW IT IN THE QUEUE I THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY 
IT'S GOT TO BE A NICE ROCKINGHAM TREACLE GLAZE 
PROBABLY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY BUT IT'S NOT 
THIS IS A PORTUGUESE MODEL 
AND IF WE LOOK UNDERNEATH 
THERE'S A CLEAR MARK THAT STATES IT WAS PRODUCED IN PORTUGAL 
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE PORTUGAL BUT THE ACTUAL MAKER'S MARK IS A LITTLE BIT UNCERTAIN 
AND IT IS MUCH LIGHTER IN WEIGHT THAN SAY AN ENGLISH EQUIVALENT 
NOW THE DAMAGE PLUS THE FACT IT'S NOT ENGLISH IT'S PORTUGUESE DOES AFFECT THE PRICE 
SO I WOULD PUT THIS AT EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY AT AUCTION 
AND THE AUCTIONEER MAY SUGGEST WE PUT A RESERVE ROUND ABOUT SIXTY 
BUT IT COULD GO FOR A HIGHER PRICE 
I THINK IT HAS GREAT APPEAL 
AND NOW THE TRADITIONAL BUTCHER IS COMING BACK INTO VOGUE 
SO YOU MIGHT HAVE THIS PURCHASED BY ONE OF THOSE GENTLEMEN FAIR ENOUGH 
NOW RICHARD I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST THING 
I'VE EVER SEEN ON FLOG IT 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
A FANTASTIC SPIRAL PIECE OF IVORY 
NOW I KNOW AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS 
BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF EVERYONE ELSE JUST LET EVERYONE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS 
IT'S ACTUALLY A NARWHAL TUSK WHICH HAS COME FROM THE NARWHAL 
AND THESE WERE TAKEN OFF THE TIP OF THE HEAD OF THE WHALE 
AND THESE THINGS HAVE BECOME EXTREMELY COLLECTABLE NOW WHERE DID YOU GET THIS FROM 
IT CAME FROM THE HOUSEHOLD OF DAME JOAN EVANS SO WHO'S DAME JOAN EVANS 
SHE'S A GREEK SCHOLAR 
AND SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF SIR ARTHUR EVANS 
WHO WAS A PART TIME ARCHAEOLOGIST ENGINEER TEACHER 
WHO GOT IT FROM 
ONE OF HER RELATIVES WHO WAS A SEA CAPTAIN IN THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTIES 
RIGHT THERE WAS TWO OF THEM 
ONE OF THEM MISS JOAN AS SHE WAS KNOWN 
GAVE TO THE NAVY AND THEY PUT IT ON THE SUBMARINE THE NARWHAL RIGHT 
AND IT CAME FROM MISS JOAN TO MY UNCLE WHO WAS A GARDENER AND GENERAL FACTOTUM 
AND THEN WHEN THEY PASSED AWAY IT CAME TO ME 
SO THERE WERE TWO OF THESE ORIGINALLY YES TWO 
AND YOU HAD ONE AND THE OTHER ONE WAS GIVEN TO THE 
NAVY WONDERFUL 
NOW THEY ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO DATE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO MARKINGS WHERE YOU COULD DATE SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
SO IT'S GOING BY PROVENANCE 
YOU MENTIONED ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTIES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT MID EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
WELL THAT'S WHEN HE WAS ALIVE AS A CAPTAIN 
SO WE ASSUME WITH HIM WORKING ON THE SEA THAT HE PICKED IT UP FROM SOME SEA 
I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT THERE WITH THE DATE 
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF IVORY 
IT'S VERY SAD TO THINK THAT IT'S COME FROM THE NARWHAL BUT IT REALLY IS SUPERB 
IN MY POSITION I DO ACTUALLY SEE A FEW OF THESE 
BUT REALLY THE COLOUR OF THIS AND THE PATINA IS SPECTACULAR 
IT IS IN VERY GOOD CONDITION BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY BRITTLE 
THEY'RE VERY EASY TO BREAK 
THE BOTTOM OF THIS HAS GOT A TINY CRACK 
A LITTLE CHIP HAS BEEN TAKEN OFF 
BUT REALLY NOTHING TO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE 
SO ANY IDEAS ON PRICE 
WELL I'VE SEEN A BIGGER ONE THAN THIS BEING DECORATED OR DRESSED 
WITH A SILVER BOSS THERE AND A SILVER TIP AT THE FRONT 
THAT WENT FOR THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
BUT IT WAS TALLER ABOUT SIX FOOT TALL 
VALUE WISE YOU LOOK AT THE HEIGHT OF THEM YOU LOOK AT THE CONDITION OF THEM AND THE COLOUR 
NOW THIS ISN'T AN EXCEPTIONAL SIZE 
I WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF FOOT 
FIVE FOOT FIVE FOOT 
YOU CAN GET THEM UP TO EIGHT FOOT I'VE SEEN AN EIGHT FOOT ONE 
THEY COMMAND THE HUGE PRICES 
I WOULD SAY YOU SHOULD PROBABLY PUT AN ESTIMATE ON OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TO THREE THOUSAND 
HOW DOES THAT SOUND TO YOU YEAH 
WHAT ABOUT A RESERVE 
YOU WANT A RESERVE YOU'RE NOT LETTING THIS GO LIGHTLY 
YOU KNOW IT'S A PRECIOUS OBJECT DON'T YOU 
IT'S PRECIOUS AND IT'S UNUSUAL 
BUT I WOULD SAY IF IT'S TWO THOUSAND TO THREE THOUSAND WE'LL SAY ABOUT TWO THOUSAND 
I THINK WE SHOULD DEFINITELY PUT A RESERVE ON OF TWO THOUSAND 
IT SHOULDN'T GO LIGHTLY IT IS A FABULOUS PIECE 
SANDRA I THINK ONE OF THE GREATEST BOONS TO HOME INDUSTRY 
IN MAKING CLOTHES DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
WAS THE MECHANICAL AID CALLED THE SEWING MACHINE RIGHT 
AND YOU'VE GOT TWO INTERESTING PIECES HERE 
EVERYBODY THINKS OF SINGERS AS BEING THE EARLY SEWING MACHINES 
BUT THERE'S A VERY GOOD HISTORICAL RECORD OF SEWING MACHINES BEING PRODUCED IN EUROPE 
AND IN PARTICULAR ENGLAND 
SO HERE WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES 
THE FIRST ONE I'M GOING TO LOOK AT IS THIS VERY STREAMLINED ONE FROM THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THIRTIES 
THIS HAS BEEN RATHER LIKE ONE OF THOSE RESTAURANTS WHERE THEY TAKE THE TUREEN COVER OFF 
WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A POSH MEAL 
AND THERE WE ARE IT'S THE IDEAL 
VERY STREAMLINED CHROMIUM 
OR POLISHED STEEL EASILY OPERATED AND TRANSPORTABLE FROM ROOM TO ROOM FROM TABLE TOP TO TABLE TOP 
AND THIS ONE HERE IS A VERY PRACTICAL LITTLE MODEL WITH VERY LITTLE TO GO WRONG ON IT 
THIS IS INTERESTING FROM A COLLECTOR'S POINT OF VIEW 
IT'S INDICATIVE OF THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THIRTIES STYLE 
THIS SORT OF ART DECO THIS MINIMALISM IN MACHINERY 
QUITE A COMPETENT EASILY WORKED LITTLE EXAMPLE 
NOT OF GREAT VALUE 
ON ITS OWN PROBABLY NO MORE THAN ABOUT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY 
WHEREAS THIS ONE IS QUITE REMARKABLE LOVELY ISN'T IT 
THIS IS A LOVELY EARLY ENGLISH SEWING MACHINE BY JAMES WEIR 
AND THIS ONE IS QUITE INTERESTING BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL IT'S CAST METAL 
AND YOU HAVE THIS LOVELY SORT OF REVIVED ROCOCO DESIGN 
WHICH WAS POPULAR IN THE MIDDLE PART OF QUEEN VICTORIA'S REIGN 
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT ALL THIS BLACK ENAMELLING WITH GILT AND COLOURED FLOWERS ON 
HIGHLY DECORATIVE I LOVE THIS LITTLE BOBBIN AT THE TOP HERE WHICH IS POSSIBLY ORIGINAL FROM THE PERIOD 
AND THIS LITTLE HANDLE WITH THE TURNED WOOD GRIP 
IT'S QUITE A NICE LITTLE PIECE 
BUT MOST IMPORTANT I CAN TAKE IT OUT OF ITS STAND 
SO IT'LL STAND PROUD LIKE THAT 
BUT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE STAND THERE'S A DIAMOND REGISTRATION MARK 
NOW THAT'S THE ENGLISH ONE AND IT GUARANTEED 
THAT NOBODY ELSE WOULD COPY THAT PARTICULAR MODEL 
SO LIKE A PATENT LIKE A PATENT IT REGISTERED THE DESIGN 
AND THIS ONE IS REGISTERED FOR ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE 
THE LETTERS ARE A LITTLE BIT BLURRED BUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE 
AND THAT'S QUITE EARLY FOR A SEWING MACHINE 
NOW I'VE SEEN THESE AT AUCTION GO QUITE HIGH 
BUT THEY'RE NORMALLY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION 
WITH ALL THE GILT WORK AND THE FULL DETAIL COMPLETE 
SO WHEN THIS COMES UP THAT'S A BIT POORLY IT IS POORLY YES 
SO I'M GOING TO PROVISIONALLY SAY 
AT AUCTION I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM GO FOR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
BUT THE AUCTIONEER MAY COME BACK AND SAY 
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT THEY'RE ONLY WORTH FIFTY 
IF SO DO YOU WANT TO SELL 
NO THAT'S FINE THEY'RE JUST IN A CUPBOARD DOING NOTHING 
NOT APPRECIATED I DID THINK OF USING THIS ONE ON THE WINDOWSILL AS AN ORNAMENT 
I THOUGHT THAT'S A SHAME JUST AN ORNAMENT 
LET SOMEBODY WHO LIKES SEWING MACHINES HAVE IT IF THEY WANT 
I QUITE AGREE THESE ARE BOTH NOW COLLECTOR'S ITEMS 
I HOPE THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY THERE 
WHO SAYS WE HAVEN'T GOT THAT IN OUR COLLECTION 
BESSIE AND KEITH THANK YOU FOR COMING ALONG TODAY 
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ALONG THIS BEAUTIFUL WALKING CANE 
NOW WHERE DID YOU GET THIS FROM 
WHEN MY MOTHER DIED AND WE CLEARED OUT THE HOUSE THAT'S WHEN I FOUND IT 
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT IS IT'S GOT THIS RATHER UNUSUAL ANGULAR SHAPE 
WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN THE SHAPE OF A BIRD 
AND IT'S SO STRIKING ALL THESE LITTLE INDIVIDUAL STRIPS OF WOOD 
I THINK WE'VE GOT SATINWOOD WE'VE GOT ROSEWOOD 
WE'VE GOT WHAT LOOKS LIKE COROMANDEL WOOD 
ALL WITH THESE WONDERFUL BANDS OF IVORY IN BETWEEN 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC AND VERY STRIKING 
RIGHT AT THE TOP HERE IT'S NOT ACTUALLY WOOD IT'S ACTUALLY HORN 
HORN 
YES I THINK IT'S STAINED HORN 
AND THEN WE'VE GOT HERE THESE LOVELY GEOMETRIC PATTERNS 
WHICH ARE MADE OUT OF IVORY AND EBONY 
NOW DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA ON DATES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
ON THE TOP THERE WE'VE GOT A NAME AND A DATE 
AH YES WE CAN SEE HERE IT IS STAMPED S. G. WILLIAMS NINETEEN OH NINE 
SO THAT'S THE DATE OF IT D'YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WILLIAMS 
NO I DON'T AND I'M WONDERING IF THAT'S GOING TO BE THE OWNER OR THE MAKER 
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE OWNER RATHER THAN THE MAKER 
AS I'M LOOKING AT IT THOUGH IT HAS GOT A VERY SLIGHT BOW TO IT 
BUT APART FROM THAT IT DOES LOOK TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION 
I JUST WONDER IF MAYBE THE FORCE OF THE WEIGHT OF MR. WILLIAMS 
I WAS GOING TO SAY IF HE WAS A BIG TUBBY MAN PERHAPS HE WAS PUSHING DOWN AND HE MADE IT BOW SLIGHTLY 
I CAN ALSO SEE HERE ONE OF THE LITTLE IVORY INSERTS HAS COME OUT 
AND THEN ALSO HERE 
THERE LOOKS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF DAMAGE 
BUT APART FROM THAT IT DOES LOOK TO BE IN VERY GOOD CONDITION 
VALUE WISE I WOULD SAY THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE LOOKING AT AN AUCTION ESTIMATE 
OF ABOUT EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED RIGHT 
HOW DOES THAT SOUND TO YOU THAT'S MORE THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 
WHAT DID YOU THINK IT WAS WORTH 
WELL I THOUGHT MAYBE FIFTY TO EIGHTY 
I THINK WE CAN ASK FOR ABOUT EIGHTY AT LEAST 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PIECE IT JUMPED OUT AT ME 
I THOUGHT IT WAS EXTREMELY STRIKING 
WE'RE IN SWINDON THE GATEWAY TO THE WEST OF ENGLAND 
SWINDON WAS A THRIVING RAILWAY TOWN IN THE VICTORIAN ERA 
SOME OF THE GREATEST STEAM LOCOMOTIVES IN THE WORLD WERE BUILT HERE 
AT GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY'S WORKSHOP 
ISAMBARD KINGDOM BRUNEL BUILT THE RAILWAY FROM BRISTOL TO LONDON 
AND HE NEEDED AN ENGINEERING WORKSHOP AT ONE OF ITS JUNCTIONS 
AND THAT WORKSHOP HERE IN SWINDON IS NOW A MUSEUM 
WHICH CELEBRATES THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY AND ITS WORKS AND IT'S CALLED STEAM 
AND THIS IS WHERE ALL THE WORK TOOK PLACE 
THE JANGLING AND GRINDING OF INDUSTRY RUNNING AT FULL PELT 
I'VE COME TO MEET THE MUSEUM'S CURATOR FELICITY BALL TO FIND OUT MORE 
WHAT WENT ON HERE 
BASICALLY WHEN THE WORKS FIRST OPENED IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTIES 
IT WAS SIMPLY A LOCOMOTIVE REPAIR DEPARTMENT 
LOCOMOTIVES WERE BOUGHT FROM OUTSIDE COMPANIES AND THEY WERE MAINTAINED AND REPAIRED HERE 
BUT THE GWR QUICKLY MOVED ON TO ACTUALLY DESIGNING AND BUILDING ITS OWN LOCOMOTIVES 
SO THEY WERE BUILT HERE AND SENT OUT TO WORK ON THE NETWORK 
AND THEN AGAIN IT EVOLVED AND CARRIAGES WAGONS 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY'S OPERATION WAS MADE HERE 
AND WHAT SORT OF SCALE OF PRODUCTION WAS GOING ON 
AT ITS HEIGHT IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES NINETEEN THIRTIES THEY WERE PRODUCING EVERYTHING THEY NEEDED 
FROM LITTLE TANK LOCOMOTIVES TO WORLD CLASS PASSENGER EXPRESS LOCOMOTIVES 
UP TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE EMPLOYED HERE THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE 
IT IS YES 
WHERE DID THEY HOUSE ALL THESE WORKERS LOCALLY 
THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY WAS VERY INNOVATIVE IN THE FACT THAT WHEN IT CAME TO SWINDON 
IT WAS ONLY A VERY SMALL LOCAL COMMUNITY 
AND THEY NEEDED TO ATTRACT SKILLED WORKERS TO THE AREA 
SO THEY BUILT WHAT WAS CALLED THE RAILWAY VILLAGE 
SWINDON RAPIDLY GREW AROUND THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY WORKS 
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE PLACE THIS IS IT'S FULL OF ATMOSPHERE IT'S VERY EXCITING 
WE'RE STANDING IN THE ASSEMBLY ROOM THE ASSEMBLY WORKSHOP WHERE THE LOCOS START TO TAKE SHAPE 
YES WE'RE STOOD IN WHAT WAS CALLED THE ERECTING SHOP 
WHERE ALL THE COMPONENTS FOR THE LOCOMOTIVE THAT WERE MADE IN THE FOUNDRY AND THE MACHINE SHOP 
WERE ALL PUT TOGETHER LIKE A HUGE JIGSAW PUZZLE 
TO MAKE THE FINISHED PRODUCT THE LOCOMOTIVE 
WE'VE GOT MODELS OF WOMEN WORKING HERE 
DO THEY REPRESENT THE WOMEN THAT WORKED HERE DUE TO THE WAR EFFORT 
IT IS YES OBVIOUSLY WHEN THE MEN WENT OFF TO FIGHT THE WAR 
THE WOMEN HAD TO COME IN AND CARRY ON THE WORK 
THE RAILWAYS WERE VERY IMPORTANT AS PART OF THE WAR EFFORT 
WORK HAD TO CONTINUE SO THE WOMEN CAME IN AND TOOK OVER EVERYTHING THE MEN DID 
RIGHT UP TO THE HEAVY CONSTRUCTION WORK 
I COULDN'T RESIST SITTING ON THE FOOTPLATE AND LOOKING AT ALL THESE DIALS AND GAUGES 
AND DREAMING OF WHAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE TO HAVE BEEN THE DRIVER OF THIS LOCOMOTIVE 
VERY EXHILARATING I WOULD IMAGINE 
HE HAD TO KEEP HIS EYE ON ALL THESE GAUGES MAKE SURE THE ENGINE WAS STOKED UP 
LOOK OUT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A CLEAR TRACK 
LOOK OUT FOR THE SIGNALS AND ALL THIS AT SPEEDS OF UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR 
THE WORKS DIDN'T ONLY MAKE LOCOMOTIVES BUT THE CARRIAGES FOR THE TRAINS TOO 
AND THIS INVOLVED SEVERAL DIFFERENT TRADES INCLUDING UPHOLSTERERS AND SEAMSTRESSES 
WELL THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANY ORDINARY CARRIAGE DOES IT 
NO THIS IS THE SALOON FROM QUEEN VICTORIA'S ROYAL TRAIN FROM THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS 
WOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK INSIDE 
LOOK AT THAT HANDLE 
VERY REGAL 
WOW IT'S JUST A SHELL 
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A GREAT STORY INVOLVED IN TRACKING THIS DOWN 
THERE WAS YES AFTER IT WAS DECOMMISSIONED IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS 
IT WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN TO MID WALES AND USED AS A HOLIDAY HOME FOR ABOUT FIFTY YEARS 
BRILLIANT I COULD IMAGINE IT AS A HOLIDAY HOME 
I'VE MOVED IN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY LUXURIOUS 
THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY GUTTED IT YES 
IT WAS TRACKED DOWN BY THE MADAME TUSSAUD'S GROUP AND BROUGHT BACK HERE TO THE MUSEUM 
IS THIS GOING TO BE RESTORED 
YOU HAVE THE SHELL NOW YOU REFIT THE INTERIOR 
WE'VE GOT THE SHELL AND SOME CLUES AS TO WHAT THE INTERIOR WAS LIKE 
WE'VE GOT THE WALLPAPER AND SOME OF THE MOULDINGS 
WE HOPE TO RAISE THE MONEY TO THEN HAVE IT RESTORED BACK TO ITS FORMER GLORY 
HERE'S SOME PHOTOGRAPHS YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN IT WAS USED AS A HOLIDAY HOME 
NOTHING LIKE A CARRIAGE IT LOOKS LIKE A SHED IT DOES 
BEFORE WE WHISK THOSE ITEMS UP TO THE SALE ROOM HERE'S A QUICK RECAP OF WHAT WE'RE TAKING WITH US 
DAVID LOVED TREVOR'S BULL 
BUT WILL IT SEE RED AND CHARGE OUT OF THE SALE ROOM

CATHERINE HAS PUT TWO TO THREE THOUSAND ON THIS 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT WEIGHTY WILL HE BE TAKING THIS HOME 
I HOPE NOT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE REALLY ADMIRED THIS 
I THINK HAD WE PUT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND 
WE WOULD BE QUITE HAPPILY CONFIDENT THAT IT WOULD GO AWAY 
OBVIOUSLY AS YOU SAID WE HAVE GOT THIS WONDERFUL PROVENANCE ABOUT IT 
WHICH HAS ENABLED US TO GET THE ARTICLE LICENSED TO ENABLE US TO SELL IT

ANYTHING POST NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN BASICALLY WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SELL 
BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU'RE TRADING IN IVORY YES
