THIS IS IT IT FELT LIKE THE END 
OF THE WORLD 
PLUS WE'RE LIVE IN 
CHINATOWN AS THE CAPITAL'S CHINESE 
COMMUNITY RESPOND TO THE 
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS ALSO TONIGHT 
REMEMBER THIS THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BID'S 
PROMISE TO GET MORE YOUNGSTERS 
INVOLVED IN SPORT AKINBIYIATIONS 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS FAILING TO 
DELIVER AND I'M ON THE ROOF OF ONE 
OF LONDON'S PALACE FIND OUT HOW 
YOU CAN BID ON LINE FOR SPECIAL 
ACCESS 
GOOD EVENING SO AS CHINA BEGINS 
THREE DAYS OF MOURNING TO REMEMBER 
THE THOUSANDS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES 
SOME WHO NARROWLY ESCAPED THE 
EARTHQUAKE ARE ONLY NOW COMING TO 
TERMS WITH THE SHEER HORROR OF WHAT 
COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM 
AMONGST THE SURVIVORS AN ESSEX 
COUPLE WHO LIVED ROUGH FOR THREE 
DAYS AND WERE KEPT ALIVE BY LOCAL 
GENEROSITY MAUREEN AND ANTONY 
BAKER HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO GEMMA 
HARRIS ABOUT THEIR ORDEAL AND THE 
SUPPORT THEY RECEIVED FROM THE 
CHINESE PEOPLE MAUREEN AND TONY 
BAKER BACK HOME NOW IN ROMFORD WITH 
THEIR SON THEY'RE DESPERATE FOR 
NEWS OF THE PEOPLE THEY LEFT BEHIND 
IN SEEKH WAN PROVINCE THE 
SICHUAN PROVINCE THE COUPLE WERE 
ON HOLIDAY WHEN THE EARTHQUAKE 
STRUCK 
MY HUSBAND TURNED HIS BACK STRUCK AND PROTECTED ME AND THEN WE GOT 
THE BLAST WHICH WAS THROWING UP 
BRANCHES AND MUD AND SMALL ROCKS 
AND EVERYTHING AND AT THAT POINT ONE 
REALLY DID THINK I WAS GOING TO DIE 
I THOUGHT THIS IS IT THIS IS THE 
END IT FELT LIKE THE END OF THE 
WORLD 
THE COUPLE HAD NO WAY OF WORLD KNOWING HOW MUCH DEATH AND 
DESTRUCTION THE EARTHQUAKE HAD 
CAUSED ALL AROUND THEM FOR THREE 
DAYS THEY WERE LIVING ROUGH ON A 
TOUR BUS AND THEY WERE KEPT ALIVE 
BY THE GENEROSITY OF THE LOCAL 
PEOPLE AROUND THEM WHO SHARED 
THEIR RICE WITH THEM 
WE WERE 
HUNGRY AND THE LOCAL PEOPLE IN THE 
MORNING LEFT A BIG POT OF RICE FOR 
OUR COACH AND THE AMERICAN COACH 
THEY HAD NOTHING AND THEY SHARED 
WITH US WHAT THEY HAD IT WAS JUST 
THE SPIRIT OF LIFTING EACH OTHER 
WE WASN'T CHINESE OR ENGLISH WE 
WAS PEOPLE IN A DIRE SITUATION NOW NOW THE COUPLE SAY THEY'RE DETERMINED 
TO RAISE MONEY TO HELP THE CHINESE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL STRUGGLING 
AFTER LOSING SO MUCH 
I CAME FACE 
TO FACE WITH THIS CHINESE WOMAN 
HER FACE WAS SWOLLEN AND HER EYES 
WERE BLOOD SHOT SHE HAD CUTS AND 
GRAZES AND BRUISES SHE WAS HANGING 
ON TO HER DAUGHTER'S NECK AND I 
LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND SHE LOOKED 
INTO MINE AND IT WAS LIKE WHY ARE 
YOU GOING WE'RE INJURED AND WE 
WANTED TO GO BUT THAT FACE WILL 
HAUNT ME FOR THE REST OF HIGH LIFE 
KARL MERCER IS IN CHINATOWN TONIGHT 
A DIFFICULT WEEK FOR THE COMMUNITY 
THERE I IMAGINE HOW ARE THEY 
RESPONDING 
AT SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THIS MORNING RESPONDING EXACTLY A WEEK ON FROM WHEN THAT 
EARTHQUAKE STRUCK IN SEEKH WAN 
PROVINCE THE SICHUAN PROVINCE 
THE CHINATOWN COMMUNITY HERE WENT 
SILENT FOR REMEMBRANCE THEY ALSO 
OPENED UP A BOOK OF CONDOLENCE AND 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE FILED 
THROUGH WRITING THEIR THOUGHTS 
ABOUT THE PEOPLE THEY MAY HAVE LOST 
DURING THE QUAKE WE UNDERSTAND 
FROM THE CHINESE EMBASSY THAT THE 
DONATIONS HAVE REACHED SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND 
BUT IT IS NOT THROUGH OFFICIAL 
SOURCES THAT THE CHINESE COMMUNITY 
HAVE BEEN DONATING YESTERDAY 
THERE WERE COLLECTORS OUT ON THE 
STREETS IN THE AFTERNOON WITH 
BUCKETS AND THEY MANAGED TO RAISE 
SEVEN THOUSAND IN JUST FOUR HOURS BUT IT 
IS NOT ENDING THERE ON WEDNESDAY 
AFTER THE THREE DAYS OF OFFICIAL 
MOURNING THAT THE CHINESE HAVE 
ANNOUNCED THERE WILL BE A CANDLE 
LIT VIGIL HERE BETWEEN EIGHT P. M. AND ELEVEN P. M. 
AND PEOPLE ARE WELCOME TO COME DOWN 
HERE AND SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS AND 
HELP VICTIMS OF THE QUAKE 
PLENTY MORE AHEAD 
I'M WITH SOME OF LONDON'S UP AND 
COMING SONGWRITERS LEARNING WHAT 
MAKES FIVE GREAT HIT 
GREAT HIT 
NOW THIS IS THE OLYMPIC PROMISE 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO 
DELIVER SO FAR THE FILM WAS PART 
OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS PROMISE OF 
ANY BIDDING CITY TO USE THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
GAMES TO INSPIRE MILLIONS OF 
YOUNGSTERS TO ACTIVELY TAKE UP 
SPORT BUT THE SUBSEQUENT PLAN TO 
MAKE THIS HAPPEN STILL HAS NOT 
MATERIALISED MUCH TO THE 
FRUSTRATION OF GRASS ROOTS SPORTING 
BODIES THIS ON THE VERY EVENING 
THAT THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC 
COMMITTEE ARRIVES IN LONDON 
READY FENCE 
THE SPORT OF ARSE 
TRATIC DULS AND MUSKETEERS 
ARISTOCRATIC DUELS AND MUSCLEERS 
BUT WOULDN'T EXPECT IT HERE IN 
FULHAM BUT THESE CHILDREN CAN'T 
GET ENOUGH OF THIS OLYMPIC SPORT 
IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU DO THINGS AND 
YOU COULD BE WITH SOMEONE TEN TIMES 
TALLER THAN YOU AND STILL BEAT 
THEM 
THIS CLUB WAS OPENED SEVERAL THEM YEARS AGO AFTER THE NEWHAM COUNCIL 
ALLOWED CHILDREN TO TRY OUT NEW 
SPORTS THEY WERE OVERWHELMED WITH 
THE RESPONSE TO FENCING IN ONE OF 
THE POOREST BOROUGHS 
IT HAS THE 
REPUTATION AT BEING AN ELITIST 
SPORT BUT HERE IT IS ALL SORTS OF 
CHILDREN FROM ALL DIFFERENT PLACES 
THIS PROJECT SHOWS YOU CAN INSPIRE 
KIDS TO TAKE UP NEW SPORTS THE 
PROBLEM IS WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR 
THE GOVERNMENT TO COME UP WITH ITS 
PLAN TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN ACROSS 
LONDON AND ACROSS BRITAIN THE 
INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE 
WILL SEE PLENTY OF BUSY BULLDOZERS 
THIS WEEK BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO LOOK 
HARD FOR THE BUILDING OF LONG 
LASTING SPORTING LEGACY THE 
LEADERS OF GRASS ROOTS SPORT SAY IT 
IS TIME FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO 
PROVIDE NEW PLANS AND NEW MONEY TO 
GET MORE KIDS EAGER TO GET INTO 
THEIR SPORTS GEAR AFTER ALL THAT 
WAS THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE PROMISE 
THERE'S NO 
POINT GOING TO A WHOLE LOAD OF 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES OR TO REGIONAL 
GROUPS AND SAYING LOOK GUYS 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN MIND IN TERMS 
OF MARKING THE OLYMPICS THERE HAS 
TO A PROPER NATIONALLY CO 
ORDINATED STRATEGY AND THERE HAS TO 
BE SOME RESOURCE BEHIND THAT 
STRATEGY TO ENSURE THE BEST 
PRACTISES ARE FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY 
THE I. O. C. WILL SEE MASSIVE PROGRESS 
AT THE SITE IN THE LAST THREE YEARS 
BUT WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR REAL 
ACTION IN THE KEY PROMISE OF THE 
GAMES GAMES MEANWHILE BRITISH MEDAL HOPEFULS 
COMPETING IN LONDON'S OLYMPICS AND 
PARALYMPICS GAMES ARE TO RECEIVE A 
CASH BOOST OF ONE MILLION THE 
PRIVATE MONEY ANNOUNCED TODAY 
WILL BE USED TO FUND THE TRAINING 
OF POTENTIAL YOUNG ATHLETES IN THE 
RUN UP TO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE FAMILY OF 
TEENAGER WHO DIED AFTER A FALL HAVE 
TODAY PAID TRIBUTE TO HER CALLING 
HER A LOVING CARING PERSON ROSY 
MEARY FROM VAUCHALL WAS FOUND IN 
FROM VAUCHALL WAS FOUND ON MONDAY 
AN INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY INTO 
THE DEATH OF CONSTRUCTION WORKER WHO WAS ON 
SNOOP SNEEP 
AN INVESTIGATION IS AN 
INVESTIGATION IS BEING CARRIED OUT 
ON A MAN JURD AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF 
SKAFLHOLDING HE WAS WORKING ON 
LIL YEAH LADELE IS TAKING ISLINGTON 
COUNCIL TO COURT SAYING THAT TO 
CARRY OUT SAME SEX MARRIAGE WOULD 
BE AGAINST HER RELIGION LILIAN 
LADELE FOR SIXTEEN YEARS A REGISTRAR 
BUT NOW AT THE CENTRE OF FIVE LAWSUIT 
MS. LADELE'S JOB REQUIRES HER TO 
CARRY OUT SAME SEX CIVIL 
PARTNERSHIP CEREMONIES BUT SHE 
SAYS IT IS AGAINST HER RELIGION SO 
THE COUNCIL IS STUCK RECOGNISING 
THE RIGHTS OF ONE OF HITS EMPLOYEES 
BUT ALSO THOSE OF SEAM SEX PARTNERS 
MS. LADELE GAVE THIS STATEMENT 
IF SHE IS REFUSING TO MARRY ANYBODY 
ELSELY IN THIS DAY AND AGE THEN SHE 
IS NOT REALLY DOING HER JOB SO 
PERHAPS SHE SHOULD RESIGN 
SHE IS 
PROBABLY IN THE WRONG JOB THERE 
SHOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYONE 
TO MARRY REGARDLESS OF GENDER AND 
SEXUAL PERSUASION 
VICTORY FOR MS. 
LADELE COULD LEAVE EMPLOYERS WIDE 
OPEN TO CHALLENGES FROM EMPLOYEES 
WHO SAY THEIR BELIEFS STOP THEM 
DOING THEIR JOBS 
THERE COULD BE 
INDIVIDUALS WHO SAY THEY DON'T WANT 
TO WORK WITH HOMOSEXUALS OR SHARE 
THE CANTEEN WITH THEM OBVIOUSLY 
THEY'D HAVE TO PUT FORWARD STRONGER 
ARGUMENTS BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE 
SAME AS MARRIAGE 
ANY RESULT IS BOUND TO LEAVE AT 
LEAST ONE PARTY FEELING THEIR 
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS HAVE BEEN 
DEVALUED DEVALUED WITH ME NOW IS MIKE JUDGE FROM THE 
CHRISTIAN INSTITUTE THAT IS PAYING 
FOR HER CASE AND DEREK MUNNS FROM 
STONEWALL WHAT IS IT ABOUT A CIVIL 
PARTNER BETWEEN TWO GAY PEOPLE THAT 
IS AT ODDS WITH RELIGIOUS BELIEFS 
WELL MS. LADELE HAS BELIEFS THAT A 
LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE IN LONDON THAT 
MARRIAGE IS FOR ONE MAN AND ONE 
WOMAN THAT IS JUST HER BELIEFS 
AND THERE ARE PLENTY WHO AGREE AND 
DISAGREE IF IT IS A CONVENTIONIOUS 
ISSUE BUT I DON'T THINK MS. LADELE 
SHOULD BE FACING THE SACK BECAUSE 
SHE HAS THAT VIEW SHE IS BEING 
THREATENED WITH THE SACK BECAUSE 
SHE IS IS A CHRISTIAN 
YOU SAY THAT 
SOME PEOPLE WOULD AGREE OR DISAGREE 
WITH SAME SEX PARTNERSHIPS BUT IT 
IS HER JOB TO CARRY OUT 
AND SHE 
HAS DONE THAT JOB FOR SIXTEEN'S BUT THE 
LAW CHANGED IF SOMEBODY APPLIES 
FOR A JOB WITH THE LAW AS IT IS AND 
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT IS A 
DIFFERENT ISSUE BUT IF THE LAW 
CHANGES THAT IS A DIFFERENT 
CIRCUMSTANCES AND NO ONE LEAVES 
THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS JUST BECAUSE 
THEY WORK AT TOWN HALL 
THAT IS A 
POINT NO ONE IS BEING DENIED A 
CIVIL CEREMONY AS A RESULT OF THIS 
SHE IS NOT THE ONLY REGISTRAR IN 
ISLINGTON SOMEBODY ELSE COULD 
PERFORM THIS 
PARLIAMENT HAS 
DECIDED THAT LESBIAN AND GAY 
COUPLES HAVE THE RIGHT TO A 
CEREMONY ALONGSIDE MARRIAGE THOSE 
WHO ARE PAID TO CARRY OILT THE LAW 
OF THE LAND NEED TO CARRY OUT THE 
LAW OF THE LAFRD LET'S SAY PEOPLE 
BELIEVED THAT INTERRACIAL MARRIAGES 
WERE WRONG AND DIDN'T WANT TO 
CARRY THEM OUT THIS IS NO MORE 
ACCEPTABLE 
WELL THE LAW DOES NOT ACCEPTABLE REQUIRE THE PROVISION OF CIVIL 
MARRIAGES IT IS THE LOCAL 
AUTHORITY THAT HAS TO PROVIDE THEM 
AND IT IS BEING PROVIDED NO ONE 
WILL BE DENIED THIS BUT LILIAN 
LADELE HAS BEEN IN THIS JOB FOR SIXTEEN 
YEARS AND LOVES IT I DON'T BELIEVE 
SHE SHOULD LOSE HER JOB JUST ON A 
CHRISTIAN ISSUE 
A JUDGE IS BEING 
FORCED TO DECIDE WHICH IS IMPORTANT 
GAY RIGHTS OR RELIGIOUS RIGHTS BUT 
WE'VE JUST HEARD THAT NO ONE IS 
BEING DENIED A SAME SEX CIVIL 
CEREMONY 
WELL WOULD IT BE CEREMONY ACCEPTABLE FOR A TEACHER TO SAY 
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LECTURE A 
PERSON WHO WAS GAY OR A DOCTOR TO 
SAY THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TREAT 
SOMEBODY WHO WAS GAME THE SERVICE 
YOU PROVIDE SHOULD BE WITHOUT ANY 
SEXUAL ORIENTATION TO THE PERSON 
YOU'RE PROVIDING A SERVICE TO SOME SOME PEOPLE IN THAT REPORT WERE SAYING 
PERHAPS SHE IS IN THE WRONG JOB 
YES BUT AGAIN YOU'RE SAYING THAT 
CHRISTIANS CAN'T WORK IN THAT AREA 
IF YOU HAVE CHRISTIAN BELIEF YOU 
CAN'T WORK IN THAT AREA ANY MORE 
AND THAT IS CONTENTIOUS DOCTORS 
AND NURSES ARE ALLOWED NOT TO DO 
SOMETHING ON BELIEF 
BUT WOULD 
A DOCTOR REFUSE TO TREAT SOMEONE 
WHO WAS HOMOSEXUAL 
I'M SURE THEY 
WOULDN'T BUT THE POINT IS IF THEY 
HAVE A PARTICULAR BELIEF ON A 
RELIGIOUS ISSUE THEY DON'T LOSE 
THEIR JOB ON THAT ISSUE AND THEY 
SHOULDN'T BE FORCED TO DO IT THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THIS ISSUE 
IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE TO DEFEND THE 
REG IS STRAR'S REGISTRAR'S 
DECISION OR SHOULD EMPLOYEES BE 
EXPECTED TO KEEP THEIR PERSONAL 
BELIEFS PRIVATE DO E. MAIL US YOUR 
THOUGHTS I WILL SHARE AS MANY AS I

NOW IT IS THE MOST FAMOUS FLOWER 
SHOW IN THE WORLD AND EVERY YEAR 
THE HUNDREDS OF DISPLAYS NEVER FAIL 
TO DISAPPOINT IN TERMS OF 
CREATIVELY AND FLORAL PERFECTION 
BUT ONE GARDEN THIS YEAR HAS BEEN 
CREATED FOR PURELY THAOER PUTIC 
THERAPEUTIC REASONS AMONGST THE 
GLITZ AND GLAMOUR OF LONDON'S MOST 
FASHIONABLE FLOWER SHOW ONE GARDEN 
HAS AN EXTRA DIMENSION THE GARDEN 
HAS BEEN DESIGNED FOR THE ELDERLY 
ESPECIALLY THOSE SUFFERING WITH 
DEMENTIA 
I AM JUST NEXT DOOR AT DEMENTIA THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN 
ONE OF ITS 
FIRST VISITORS WAS THIS PENSIONER

DEBILITATING CONDITION OF DEMENTIA 
THROUGH HIS CHARACTER JACK IN THE 
RADIO FOUR DRAMA THE ARCHERS I I THINK JACK WOULD LOVE IT BECAUSE 
IT'S LOVELY THERE IS PLACES YOU 
CAN SIT DOWN AS WELL WHICH IS VERY 
NICE 
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD HELP NICE JACK WITH WHAT HE IS GOING THROUGH 
I THINK IT WOULD IT'S HELPING ME 
ANYWAY I AM SLIGHTLY ANCIENT TOO 
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST PUNGENT 
HERBS 
IT WAS CREATED BY AWARD HERBS WINNING DESIGNER CLEAVE WEST WE WE ARE TRYING TO PICK UP ON COLOUR 
SOUND WE HAVE TREES SO BIRD SONG 
IS ANOTHER THING 
THIS DOCTOR 
BELIEVES THE GARDEN SHOULD HAVE 
BENEFICIAL USE 
IT'S FULL OF 
STIMULATION GENTLE SOUNDS OF WATER 
IT'S VIBRANT TACTILE THERE ARE 
THINGS TO TOUCH AND SEE IT MEETS 
ALL THE EMOTIONAL SENSORY NEEDS OF 
A PERSON WITH DEMENTIA SO REALLY 
IT'S SENSORY PLEASURE WE WISH TO 
ACHIEVE 
UNLIKE MOST OF THE OTHER ACHIEVE DISPLAYS IT'S NOT JUST HERE FOR 
CHELSEA NEXT WEEK IT WILL BE 
TRANSPLANTED TO A CARE HOME IN 
NEARBY BATTERSEA 
LET'S GO BACK TO HAMPTON COURT 
PALACE AND SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T NEED 
ROYAL PERTPHOEUGS GET IN 
PERMISSION TO GET IN 
IT'S LOVELY THE GARDEN HERE AS YOU 
CAN SEE ABOVE THE ROOF OF HAMPTON 
COURT GREY SKIES THEY WERE DARK 
AND THREATENING A FEW MINUTES AGO 
WE DIDN'T GET RAIN AND THAT'S THE 
CASE FOR THIS WEEK THERE WILL BE 
SOME THICKER CLOUD AROUND FROM TIME 
TO TIME BUT IT WILL STAY MOSTLY 
DRY FEELING QUITE CHILLY THIS 
EVENING A CHILLY EASTERLY BREEZE 
LATER IN THE WEEK WE WILL LOSE THAT 
WON'T FEEL AS COLD BUT AS 
TEMPERATURES START TO PICK UP SO 
WILL WE HAVE AN INCREASING RISK OF 
A SHOWER OR TWO AS FAR AS THIS 
EVENING IS CONCERNED THOUGH WE ARE 
GOING TO START TO HRO THIS CLOUD L. 
CAN SEE SOME BLUE SKY THAT WAY 
THAT WILL BE WORKING ITS WAY ACROSS 
THE LONDON AREA THIS EVENING BY 
THE END OF THE NIGHT WE WILL 
PROBABLY HAVE CLEAR SKIES IT'S 
GOING TO TURN QUITE COLD YOU WILL 
NOTICE A BLUE TINGE TO THE NORTH OF 
LONDON GARDENERS FARMERS THERE 
COULD BE A TOUCH OF FROST ON THE 
GROUND LOTS OF SUN BEHIND TO MELT 
ANY FROST QUICKLY LIKE TODAY CLOUD 
WILL POP UP AND LIKE TODAY IT WILL 
SPREAD OUT BUT STILL A LOT OF BLUE 
SKY AROUND PROBABLY LOOKING AT 
TEMPERATURES TOMORROW SIMILAR TO 
TODAY TODAY AS FAR AS WEDNESDAY IS CONCERNED 
VERY SIMILAR WEATHER TEMPERATURES 
STARTING TO PICK UP A LITTLE BIT 
WEDNESDAY THURSDAY YOU CAN SEE THE 
REASON WHY IN THE OUTLOOK WE START 
TO LOSE THE EASTERLY BREEZE WE GET 
MORE OF A SOUTHERLY BREEZE AND THAT 
WILL LIFT TEMPERATURES BY A DEGREE 
OR SO EACH DAY 
BACK NOW TO THE ISSUE OF THE 
REGISTRAR WHO IS REFUSING TO MARRY 
GAY COUPLES BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS 
BELIEFS WE ASKED FOR YOUR VIEWS 
DARREN AND DEREK SAY THIS LADY IS 
CARRYING OUT THE LAW OF THE LAND 
NOT A RELIGIOUS LAW F. HER BELIEF IS 
THAT STRONG SHE IS DEFINITELY IN 
THE WRONG JOB MARK SAYS HE TOO IS 
A CHRISTIAN AND FINDS HER 
DISCRIMINATORY VIEWS 
UNREPRESENTATIVE OF THE FAITH 
DISCRIMINATION HAS NO PLACE IN 
CHURCH OR IN STATE ON THE OTHER 
HAND ANOTHER SAYS THE REGISTRAR HAS 
EVERY RIGHT TO REFUSE TO CARRY OUT 
A CIVIL SERVICE CEREMONY AND SHE 
COMPLETELY SUPPORTS HER IN THAT 
DECISION DAVE SAYS YOU CAN'T 
PENALISE CHRISTIANS FOR STANDING UP 
FOR SOMETHING ESPECIALLY IN THIS 
CASE WHEN THIS WASN'T IN THE LEGAL 
REMIT OF THE JOB SIXTEEN YEARS AGO 
THIS ONE SAYS RELIGION IS A DATED 
CONCEPT THIS LADY EITHER MOVES 
WITH THE TIMES OR ACCEPTS SHE IS IN 
THE WRONG JOB THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
INDEED A LOT OF RESPONSE TO THAT 
NOW TONIGHT'S MAIN NEWS THE WAY
