TODAY WE ARE IN ONE OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITY TOWNS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD 
NOT ONLY IS IT FAMOUS FOR ITS UNIVERSITY BUT ALSO OXFORD IS A LITERARY CAPITAL 
IT'S HOME TO THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY AND BOASTS MORE WRITERS 
PER SQUARE MILE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD 
C. S. LEWIS AND JRR TOLKIEN WERE BOTH OXFORD DONS 
OUR EXPERTS TODAY ARE SCHOLARS MARK STACEY AND WILL AXON 
LET'S HOPE THEY FIND FIRST CLASS ITEMS IN THIS ARCHITECTURAL DELIGHT OXFORD TOWN HALL 
HELLO HEATHER HELLO YOU'VE BROUGHT A NICE CHARLOTTE RHEAD VASE IN TO SHOW US YES 
IT WAS A WEDDING PRESENT YES IT WAS MY MOTHER'S WHICH YEAR NINETEEN THIRTY SIX WELL SPOT ON ISN'T IT 
WE'VE GOT A TYPICAL ART DECO VASE CHARLOTTE RHEAD WAS A STRONG EXPONENT OF THIS DECORATION 
WITH QUITE VIVID COLOURS 
I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE AUTUMNAL ORANGES YES AND GREENS 
YOU OFTEN FIND ON THESE THAT THEY ARE RIBBED YOU GET THIS RIBBING ALL ROUND THE BODY 
SO IT WAS A WEDDING PRESENT IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX THAT'S RIGHT PASSED DOWN TO YOU 
YES AND WHERE DOES IT LIVE IN A CUPBOARD OH WHAT A SHAME 
YEAH LET'S HAVE A LITTLE LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT UNDERNEATH IS THE MARK OF CROWN DUCAL 
AND THEN RHEAD AND THE SHAPE AND PATTERN NUMBER A FULL SET OF MARKS 
RIGHT TELL ME IT'S LIVED IN YOUR CUPBOARD BUT WHAT DON'T YOU LIKE ABOUT IT 
I DO LIKE IT BUT EM IT'S NEVER REALLY BEEN ONE THAT GOES OUT ON SHOW 
NOT GOT ANYTHING ELSE LIKE IT NO COS THAT'S ANOTHER THING 
IF YOU'VE GOT A COLLECTION THEY GO NICE TOGETHER BUT ONE ON ITS OWN DOESN'T QUITE FIT IN 
THESE COLOURS ARE SO STRONG YOU NEED THE RIGHT KIND OF ROOM TO PUT IT IN I THINK SO 
WAS IT A FAVOURITE OF YOUR MUM'S YES I THINK SO 
WITH FLOWERS SHE'D ALWAYS USE IT 
WELL IF WE WERE PUTTING IT IN FOR SALE WE'D BE LOOKING AT AROUND THE FIFTY MARK RIGHT 
SO MAYBE AN ESTIMATE OF FORTY TO SIXTY WITH A FORTY RESERVE YES 
IT SHOULD ATTRACT COLLECTORS THIS PARTICULAR DESIGN IS FAIRLY COMMON 
IT IS A NICE HONEST PIECE THERE SHOULD BE COLLECTORS OUT THERE IS THAT O. K. WITH YOU 
FINE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IT AT AUCTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
JOANNA HELLO THERE HELLO YOU'VE BROUGHT SOME INTERESTING ALBUMS WHERE ARE THEY FROM 
THEY BELONGED TO MY GRANDMOTHER SHE'S DEAD NOW SHE'S NOT WITH US ANY MORE 
SO THEY'VE COME THROUGH YOUR MOTHER'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY YES 
I'LL OPEN UP THIS FIRST ALBUM HERE YOU'VE GOT THIS GREAT COLLECTION OF CORRESPONDENCE CRESTS 
A LOT OF THESE WOULD HAVE COME OFF ENVELOPES RIGHT 
TURNING THE PAGE WE HAVE WAX SEALS AGAIN THEY WERE USED TO OFFICIALISE CORRESPONDENCE AND TO SEAL IT 
YEAH YOU SUSPECT YOUR GRANDMOTHER DIDN'T PUT THIS ALBUM TOGETHER 
NO I DON'T THINK SHE DID SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT 
WAS SHE QUITE INTO I THINK SO I WAS QUITE YOUNG WHEN SHE DIED 
BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW SHE WOULD COLLECT THINGS 
YOU DO THESE WAX SEALS IMPRESSED FROM SIGNET RINGS YOU SEE MAINLY GENTLEMEN WEARING SIGNET RINGS 
AND THEN EARLIER FOB SEALS GENTLEMEN SEALED THE WAX THAT WAY YES 
THEY'RE NICELY MOUNTED HERE UNFORTUNATELY FOR A COLLECTOR 
THAT CAN BE DETRIMENTAL THAT THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN STUCK DOWN RIGHT 
AND IN THIS CASE A DOUBLE SIDED PAGE SO THERE'S NO WAY THESE CAN BE CUT OUT 
AND INDIVIDUALLY MOUNTED AGAIN HAVE YOU HAD A LEAF THROUGH 
YES THERE'S A COUPLE OF NAMES I THOUGHT MIGHT BE OF SOME INTEREST 
LADY CHURCHILL YOU'RE RIGHT 
AND VISCOUNT PALMERSTON WHO MIGHT BE THE PRIME MINISTER 
IT MIGHT BE YEAH YOU'VE ALMOST GOT THE ROYAL COAT THERE YES 
I THINK THAT PROBABLY IS IF YOU FLICK FORWARD WE'VE GOT MORE OF THESE ENVELOPE CRESTS YEAH 
THEY'VE BEEN CUT OUT AND MOUNTED WHICH BRINGS US ON TO THE SECOND ALBUM 
THERE'S NO CLUE ON THE COVERS 
BUT INSIDE IS THIS BEAUTIFUL KATE EVANS CHILD IT DOESN'T CORRESPOND TO THE FAMILY NO 
IN THIS ALBUM YOU START TO GET SOME ARTISTIC LICENCE YES 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S DONE BY A CHILD 
IT DOES TO A DEGREE YOU'VE GOT SIMPLE GEOMETRIC SHAPES 
BUT THEY START TO BECOME A BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED WITH SOME DECOUPAGE 
PERHAPS AS SHE GOT OLDER THEY MATURED IN DESIGNS YES 
THIS ONE'S RATHER FUN WITH FAUX ENVELOPES INTERLOCKING A NICE TOUCH 
HAVE YOU HAD THEM LOOKED AT BEFORE NO I HAVEN'T NO 
ANY INKLING AS TO VALUE I WOULDN'T HAVE A CLUE 
THEY'RE NOT LIKE STAMPS WITH A FACE VALUE 
AND THAT FACE VALUE CAN GENERALLY GO UP AND IS COLLECTED 
THESE HAVE MORE DECORATIVE APPEAL 
NOT HUGELY VALUABLE I'M AFRAID BUT ESTIMATE WISE 
WE SHOULD PUT AN ESTIMATE OF THIRTY TO FIFTY THAT SORT OF LEVEL 
FORTY TO SIXTY PERHAPS THAT'D BE FINE SHALL WE GO FOR THE THIRTY TO FIFTY RESERVED AT THIRTY THAT SOUNDS GREAT 
BIT OF AUCTIONEER'S DISCRETION YEAH THAT'S FINE RATHER THAN NOT SELL THEM 
SO WE'LL SEE YOU AT THE SALE ROOM YEP THAT'LL BE FINE GREAT 
ROSALYN THIS IS FABULOUS ISN'T IT IT'S WHAT I EXPECT IN OXFORD 
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT A BOOK ON ALL THE COLLEGES 
IF I WANTED TO LEARN ABOUT THE COLLEGES THIS IS THE IDEAL BOOK 
A BIT BIG FOR A POCKET BOOK YES BUT I'D STILL BUY IT 
BUT I WOULDN'T TAKE IT ON A PLANE I WOULD DEFINITELY PUT IT IN THE BACK OF THE CAR 
HOW DID YOU COME BY THIS MY FRIEND IT'S HER HOUSE I NOW LIVE IN 
SHE SOLD IT TO ME AND THIS WAS IN THE HOUSE WHEN I LOVED IN 
I'VE LOVED IT I'VE LOOKED AT IT LEARNT A LOT I PROMISED MYSELF FROM THE DAY I OPENED IT TO READ IT 
HAVE YOU IT'S TOO BIG AND HEAVY 
IT IS A BIT ON THE TABLE IT'S ALL RIGHT BUT YOU NEED A BIG TABLE YOU NEED A BIG TABLE YEAH 
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF FOXING BUT NOT TOO MUCH 
IT'S ONLY REALLY IN THE PRETEXT AND INDEX AND LIST OF SUBSCRIBERS 
IT'S PRINTED IN LONDON YES EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS YES 
AND IT'S ALL HERE IT MIGHT GET BROKEN UP BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S EARLY ENOUGH 
THE ENGRAVINGS ARE COPIES OF STEEL ENGRAVINGS PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTS 
IF THESE WERE STEEL OR COPPER ENGRAVINGS WHICH WOULD BE EARLIER 
THEY WOULD GET KNIFED OUT AND HAND TINTED OR JUST SOLD 
FRAMED UP AND SOLD OFF FOR THIRTY ODD EACH 
BEING AN ARTIST I CONSIDERED IT YOU COULD HAVE DONE THAT 
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS WICKED IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL BOOK YES 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PHOTOGRAPHS YOU CAN SEE THE BUILDINGS AS THEY WERE THEN 
AND THEY HAVEN'T ALTERED AT ALL 
THE PHOTOGRAPHY ON THE INSIDE YOU CAN LEARN A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE MOULDINGS AND CARVINGS 
SO WHY HAVEN'T YOU READ IT AND WHY DO YOU WANT TO FLOG IT 
IT'S WASTING AWAY IN A CUPBOARD IT COMES OUT WHEN I HAVE AUSTRALIAN VISITORS TRINITY COLLEGE 
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL IT COMES OUT FOR YOUR AUSSIE FRIENDS YEAH AND THEN IT GOES AWAY AGAIN 
WOULD YOU WANT TO FLOG THIS YES IT'S NOT A GREAT DEAL OF VALUE 
BUT IF TWO PEOPLE FIGHT FOR THIS BOOK WE COULD GET FIFTY TO SIXTY 
LOVELY WOULD YOU BE HAPPY YEAH 
I'LL PUT IT INTO AUCTION WITH A VALUATION OF THIRTY TO FIFTY 
SHALL WE PUT A FIXED RESERVE ON IT OR DO YOU JUST WANT IT TO GO A FIXED RESERVE THIRTY QUID YEAH 
LET'S FLOG IT THEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH SUPER 
MARION HELLO THERE HELLO WHAT A DELIGHTFUL THING 
I THINK IT'S RATHER PRETTY BUT IT JUST SITS AROUND IN MY FLAT 
I THOUGHT I SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND LET SOMEONE APPRECIATE IT OR A COLLECTOR 
EXACTLY THESE THINGS ARE ON THE MARKET 
YES THEY ARE IT'S A SILVER CARD CASE THESE CAME INTO FASHION 
IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN THE WHOLE FASHION OF CALLING ON PEOPLE AND LEAVING YOUR CARD 
OH IT'S NOT A CIGARETTE CASE NO I WOULD SAY A CALLING CARD A CALLING CARD CASE 
CIGARETTE CASES TENDED TO BE LARGER NOT SO LARGE THAT YOU CAN FIT MODERN DAY CIGARETTES IN 
BUT CERTAINLY NOT THIS SIZE 
YOU'VE GOT THIS WONDERFUL COUNTRY VIEW WORKED IN ENAMELS 
THIS IS A NARROW BOAT AND AN ENGLISH COTTAGE BY THE RIVERSIDE 
AND A WONDERFUL SUNSET THE COLOUR'S VERY VIBRANT 
DO YOU THINK IT'S A CONSTABLE BEING FROM EAST ANGLIA MYSELF 
IT HAS SOMETHING OF THE NORWICH SCHOOL EAST ANGLIAN FEEL ABOUT IT 
LET'S HAVE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE INSIDE THAT GIVES US A CLUE AS TO WHERE IT'S FROM 
WE'VE GOT SOME MARKS HERE IT WAS IMPORTED INTO LONDON AROUND NINETEEN TWENTIES NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE THAT SORT OF PERIOD 
ITS ORIGINAL COUNTRY OF ORIGIN I SUSPECT 
IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE AUSTRIA FRANCE IT'S THAT SORT OF AREA WE'RE TALKING IN EUROPE 
WHERE A LOT OF THIS WAS BEING DONE 
NOW IF WE TURN IT OVER 
ON THE BACK OF THE PIECE WE'VE GOT QUITE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE 
FOR A PIECE ENAMELLED LIKE THIS IT'S QUITE A SERIOUS DEFECT 
IT CAN AFFECT THE VALUE QUITE CONSIDERABLY BUT GIVES A LOVELY INSIGHT INTO HOW THAT IS DONE 
WHEN THEY ENGINE TURN THIS DECORATION ONTO THE METAL BODY 
THEN LAY THIS TRANSLUCENT ENAMEL OVER THE TOP 
IT THEN REFLECTS THIS TOOLING AND THAT GIVES IT THIS SHIMMERING PATTERN 
WITHIN THE ENAMEL I SEE 
IT'S NICE THAT IT'S GIVEN US AN INSIGHT INTO THAT YES 
HAVE YOU HAD IT VALUED NO 
IT'S BEEN SITTING THERE AND I NEVER THOUGHT OF HAVING IT VALUED YOU ACQUIRED IT HOW FROM MY MOTHER 
YOUR MOTHER AND DID SHE BUY IT NO IT CAME FROM HER SISTER 
I SEE AND IT'S SORT OF BEEN THROUGH THE FAMILY 
THERE'S NO ONE YOU WANT TO NO I DON'T THINK SO 
WELL YOU'RE HAPPY TO SELL IT VERY HAPPY 
WE JUST NEED TO AGREE A VALUE 
BEARING IN MIND THE DAMAGE ON THE ENAMELLING ON THE BACK WHICH WILL AFFECT VALUE 
YOU CAN'T GET ROUND THAT I THINK WE SHOULD ESTIMATE ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
FINE YES THAT'S GREAT I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THAT WE'LL RESERVE IT AT ONE HUNDRED 
YES I'M CONFIDENT IT WILL MAKE MORE SO IT SHOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM 
I THINK THE PICTURE MIGHT SELL IT EXACTLY 
IT'S LOOKING VERY BUSY DOWN THERE THERE'S DEFINITELY AN AIR OF TENSION AND EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE PLACE 
ALL THOSE PEOPLE ARE HOPING THEIR ITEM WILL GET PICKED TO GO THROUGH TO THE AUCTION ROOM 
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE OFF TO RIGHT NOW FOR OUR FIRST VISIT 
HERE'S A QUICK RUN DOWN OF THE ITEMS THAT WILL GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
MARK IS CONFIDENT THE CHARLOTTE RHEAD VASE SHOULD ATTRACT THE COLLECTORS 
BUT I FEAR THAT THE CRESTS BEING MOUNTED WILL AFFECT THESE BOOKS 
I SPOTTED A BIT OF LOCAL HISTORY WITH THESE OXFORD PRINTS 
EVEN THOUGH THE ENAMEL CALLING CARD CASE IS DAMAGED WILL FEELS SURE IT'S GOING TO DO WELL 
NOW THE MOMENT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR AS WE PUT THOSE VALUATIONS TO THE TEST 
I'VE COME TO WATLINGTON TO JONES AND JACOB 
LET'S GO INSIDE AND TALK TO THE MAN WITH THE GAVEL AND ALL THE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AUCTIONEER SIMON JONES 
BIT OF LOCAL INTEREST I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THIS LOT IT'S ONE I VALUED 
DIDN'T PUT A LOT ON IT THIRTY TO FIFTY 
A LITTLE BIT OF FOXING ON SOME PLATES BUT IT'S ALL THERE YES 
ARCHITECTURAL DETAIL IS FANTASTIC SOME SUPERB PLATES ROSALYN WANTS TO GET RID OF IT 
I SAID IT COULD DO FIFTY PLUS 
YOU CAN'T BUY A NEW ONE FOR LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OF THAT QUALITY 
IT'S BY BATSFORD ONE OF THE TOP PUBLISHERS 
ALL THERE PERFECT ORDER APART FROM A LITTLE BIT OF FOXING 
WITH THE LOCAL INTEREST IT SHOULD DO VERY WELL 
YEAH VERY HAPPY WITH THAT HAPPY TO STICK YOUR NECK ON THE BLOCK AND PUSH MY ESTIMATE

THERE ARE PLENTY OF COLLECTORS FOR THIS KIND OF THING CERTAINLY 
THEY DISPLAY THEM YES I'M HOPING THAT THE FACT THAT IT'S LOST SOME ENAMEL ON THE BACK 
ISN'T GOING TO DETRACT TERRIBLY AS IT WILL BE LAID DOWN ON A TABLE 
IT REALLY SCREAMS QUALITY IT'S A LOVELY PASTORAL SCENE 
I THINK THE LITTLE PICTURE IS GOING TO DO THE TRICK THAT'S IT THAT'S WHERE THE VALUE IS 
IT REALLY IS VERY PRETTY THEY LOOK MORE EXPENSIVE TOGETHER ONCE YOU GET HALF A DOZEN 
THEY REALLY SET EACH OTHER OFF YES THEY DO YES

IT'S BEAUTIFUL THERE THAT SORT OF AREA 
SOMEWHERE DIFFERENT WELL ENJOY THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
EXCELLENT 
NOT BAD SO FAR BUT THERE'S PLENTY MORE AUCTION ACTION LATER 
RIGHT NOW IT'S MY TURN TO NIP OFF AND EXPLORE A BIT OF OXFORD 
I'M GOING TO LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT'S CENTURIES OLD AND IT'S GOT EXTREMELY THICK WALLS 
THERE'S A CLUE 
OXFORD CASTLE WAS USED AS A PLACE OF INCARCERATION FROM ONE THOUSAND SEVENTY TWO 
RIGHT UP TO THE PRESENT DAY AND THE CLOSURE OF HER MAJESTY'S PRISON IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX 
THROUGHOUT THE AGES THE JAIL DEVELOPED A TERRIBLE REPUTATION 
FOR THE CONDITIONS PRISONERS ENDURED NOW FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN ONE THOUSAND YEARS 
THE SECRETS OF THE CASTLE CAN BE DISCOVERED BY THE PUBLIC 
OXFORD CASTLE PLAYED A KEY ROLE DURING THE ENGLISH CIVIL WAR 
AND ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PRISONERS DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME WAS JOHN LILBURNE 
TO TELL ME ABOUT HIM IS CARYS HEDGES ONE OF THE TOUR GUIDES AT UNLOCKED OXFORD CASTLE 
SO WHO WAS JOHN LILBURNE HE WAS A POLITICAL ACTIVIST 
WHO LED A GROUP THE LEVELLERS WHO FOUGHT FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH 
WHAT WAS HE INCARCERATED FOR 
HE WAS IN AND OUT OF PRISON ALL OF HIS LIFE BUT HE WAS IN OXFORD 
FOR DEFENDING THE PARLIAMENTARIAN POSITION AT BRENTFORD 
OXFORD CASTLE HAD A KEY PART TO PLAY DURING THE ENGLISH CIVIL WAR OXFORD WAS TEMPORARY CAPITAL OF ENGLAND 
ABSOLUTELY THAT'S RIGHT CHARLES I WAS FORCED TO RELOCATE HIS HEADQUARTERS FROM LONDON 
AFTER QUITE A DECISIVE BATTLE AT EDGEHILL HE HELD HIS COURT HERE AND HE LIVED HERE 
WHAT WERE CONDITIONS LIKE HERE IN THE PRISON FOR HIM AND THE INMATES 
JOHN LILBURNE WAS QUITE LUCKY HE WAS ABLE TO PAY HIS WAY 
MANY OTHERS WEREN'T SO LUCKY IT WAS VERY UNPLEASANT 
THERE WAS A PRISON KEEPER HERE WHO HAD A CRUEL REPUTATION 
HE KEPT PRISONERS SOMETIMES SIXTY TO A CELL FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME 
A CELL THIS SIZE YES ABOUT THE SIZE OF THIS ROOM 
THEY'D HAVE BEEN LYING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER THE DEAD WEREN'T TAKEN AWAY 
DISEASE WAS RIFE THEY LEFT PEOPLE THERE ROTTING REALLY QUITE CRUEL 
WHAT WAS THE FATE OF LILBURNE JOHN LILBURNE ONCE HE KNEW HE WOULD BE TRIED FOR HIGH TREASON 
SMUGGLED A LETTER OUT TO HIS WIFE ELIZABETH 
SHE WAS A POLITICAL ACTIVIST TOO 
SHE TOOK THIS LETTER TO LONDON AND PETITIONED PARLIAMENT UNTIL THEY GRANTED A REPRIEVE 
THEY WROTE A LETTER SAYING THAT SHOULD JOHN LILBURNE AND HIS FELLOW PRISONERS BE EXECUTED HERE 
THEY WOULD EXECUTE ROYALIST PRISONERS IN LONDON IN REPRISALS IT WAS A VERY EFFECTIVE LETTER 
ELIZABETH HAD TO GET IT TO OXFORD SHE WAS HEAVILY PREGNANT IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF WINTER 
SHE WAS ON FOOT AN UNARMED WOMAN TRYING TO WALK THROUGH THE CIVIL WAR IT WAS AMAZING 
OBVIOUSLY A VERY DETERMINED LADY 
ABSOLUTELY SO WHAT WAS THE OUTCOME OF LILBURNE 
HE DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES HE NEVER WAS HANGED IN THE END 
SO YOU COULD SAY IT WAS A HAPPY ENDING YES 
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IF YOU WERE POOR AND IN A TIGHT SPOT THE ONLY WAY OUT WAS TO BORROW MONEY 
OR TURN TO CRIME MANY OF THE PRISONERS WERE PETTY CROOKS PROSTITUTES AND THIEVES 
VAGABONDS AND DEBTORS 
BUT NOT ALL THE PRISONERS WERE FROM THE LOWER CLASSES OR MALE 
ONE CASE THAT CAUSED QUITE A STIR IN POLITE SOCIETY INVOLVED A WOMAN 
SHE WAS YOUNG SHE WAS PRETTY SHE WAS MIDDLE CLASS AND HER NAME WAS MARY BLANDY 
SO WHO WAS MARY BLANDY SHE WAS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PRISONERS HERE SHE CAUSED A SCANDAL 
WHAT WAS SHE INCARCERATED FOR IT WAS FOR PATRICIDE WHICH WAS KILLING HER FATHER 
MARY WAS THE ONLY CHILD OF QUITE A WEALTHY LAWYER FRANCIS BLANDY 
SHE WAS GETTING ON A BIT AROUND THIRTY AND WAS STILL UNMARRIED 
FRANCIS ADVERTISED A DOWRY FOR HER OF TEN THOUSAND IN THE HOPE OF ATTRACTING A SUITOR 
CAPTAIN WILLIAM CRANSTON ANSWERED THE SON OF A SCOTTISH NOBLEMAN QUITE A RESPECTABLE MAN 
HE WAS INVITED TO LIVE IN THE BLANDY HOUSEHOLD AND IT ALL WENT WELL 
UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE WEDDING WHEN FRANCIS DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS ALREADY MARRIED 
BIT OF A PROBLEM THE CAD I KNOW ABSOLUTELY 
SO HE WAS CAST FROM THE HOUSE AND THAT WAS IT OR SO FRANCIS THOUGHT 
UNFORTUNATELY IT WASN'T WILLIAM AND MARY HAD FALLEN IN LOVE 
SHE TURNED AGAINST HER FATHER WELL NOBODY QUITE KNOWS 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT UNDECIDED THE JURY DECIDED SHE HAD 
SHE WAS GIVEN A WHITE POWDER BY CRANSTON AND ASKED TO SPRINKLE IT ON HER FATHER'S FOOD 
SHE SAID SHE WAS TOLD IT WAS A LOVE FILTER LIKE OPIUM TO MAKE HIM SO RELAXED AND HAPPY 
HE'D BE PLEASED SHE WAS GETTING MARRIED HE DIED IT WAS ARSENIC 
THIS WAS A BUILD UP OVER TIME 
SO WHAT WAS HER FINAL OUTCOME HER LAST WISH WAS NOT TO BE HANGED TOO HIGH OFF THE GROUND 
IN CASE ANYONE LOOKED UP HER SKIRTS A LADY TO THE END 
HELLO THERE HELLO CAN I OPEN IT UP AND SEE WHAT YOU'VE BROUGHT 
A THREE STONE OPAL YES 
AND FOUR STONE DIAMOND RING I CAN TELL IT'S EIGHTEEN CARAT GOLD 
NICE QUALITY IT'S BEEN RESIZED AT SOME STAGE 
OH RIGHT THAT'S WHY YOU'VE MAYBE LOST THE DATE LETTER ON THAT 
WE CAN PROBABLY DATE IT ACCURATELY TO THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
PERHAPS TURN OF THE CENTURY RIGHT 
WE'VE GOT THREE GRADUATED OPALS PROBABLY AUSTRALIAN OPALS 
AND THIS NICE SCROLL WORK MOUNT TO THE SIDE WHICH AGAIN ADDS QUALITY 
WITH JEWELLERY YOU CAN TELL THE QUALITY BY LOOKING AT THE BACK 
TO SEE THE QUALITY OF WHAT YOU DON'T SEE HOW DID YOU COME BY IT 
I INHERITED IT FROM A RELATIVE 
AND SHE HAD INHERITED IT I BELIEVE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES FROM ANOTHER RELATIVE 
THERE'S NO ONE YOU'D LIKE TO PASS IT ON TO MY DAUGHTER DOESN'T LIKE IT 
RIGHT SHE'S GOT EYES ON OTHER PIECES BUT NOT THIS PIECE 
SO WE'RE PRETTY SAFE PUTTING THIS IN THE SALE AND REALISING SOME MONEY FOR IT 
YOUR DAUGHTER NOT FINDING IT TO HER TASTE IS A MAJOR FACTOR WHEN JEWELLERY IS AUCTIONED 
AS RINGS GO PEOPLE DO LIKE THE COMBINATION OF OPAL AND DIAMONDS 
THAT'S QUITE POPULAR BUT SHE'S NOT INTERESTED AND YOU 
I HAVE WORN IT LESS THAN HALF A DOZEN TIMES IN TWENTY YEARS 
ANY REASON FOR THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT MY STYLE 
NOT YOUR TYPE OF THING IT'S VERY PRETTY YEAH YOU CAN APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT FALLING IN LOVE WITH IT 
WHEN WE GET TO THE AUCTION VALUE OBVIOUSLY WITH GOLD DIAMONDS THERE'S A MATERIAL VALUE THERE 
BUT I THINK ON ONE OF THESE OPALS WE'VE JUST GOT A SMALL CHIP 
YES YES IT'S TINY THERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACTOR THAT INTO THE VALUATION 
IT WILL BE PICKED UP ON YES IF WE FACTOR THAT IN IT SHOULDN'T GIVE US ANY NASTY SURPRISES 
HAVE YOU HAD IT VALUED IN THE PAST IT WAS VALUED IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE 
YES FOR SIXTY FIVE I THINK AT AUCTION YOU SHOULD PUT AN ESTIMATE ON THIS 
OF PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND PERHAPS RESERVE IT AT THE BOTTOM FIGURE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YES 
AT THAT SORT OF ESTIMATE IT WILL BE WELL RECEIVED AND HOPEFULLY THE BUYER WILL WEAR IT 
IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO BE STUCK IN A CUPBOARD EXACTLY SO LET'S PUT IT IN THE SALE 
FINGERS CROSSED SOMEONE LIKES IT 
HELLO TONY HELLO I'VE SEEN SOME THINGS ON FLOG IT IN MY TIME 
BUT I HAVEN'T COME ACROSS AN OLD PIECE OF ROPE LIKE THIS IT'S A LASSO ISN'T IT 
HOW DID IT END UP WITH YOU MY FATHER BOUGHT IT IN READING HORSE SALE DAY 
AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS AGO IN A BOX OF OTHER THINGS NO THEY SELL THE HORSES 
AND SELL THE SADDLERY SEPARATE 
IT WAS A LOT IN THE SADDLERY 
AND DID HE BUY IT AS A LASSO I THINK HE BOUGHT IT AS A LASSO HE WAS ALWAYS INTO HORSES 
AND IT STAYS IN THE GARAGE DOES IT YEAH YOU DON'T GET IT OUT AND TRY TO LASSO THE LOCAL DOGS NO 
THEY DID USED TO USE IT WHEN HE RETIRED DOWN TO THE NEW FOREST 
THEY DID USE IT A TIME OR TWO CATCHING PONIES OH REALLY 
SO IT HAS BEEN ACTUALLY USED OH YEAH WONDERFUL 
SHOW US HOW IT GOES THEN THAT'S HOW YOU BUILD IT UP 
THE LOOP AT THAT END THAT'S WHAT YOU THROW OVER THE HORSE'S HEAD 
O. K. I'M FASCINATED TO SEE HOW THIS GOES 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
YEAH YOU GET THAT THROUGH AND AS WE RUN IT BACK IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT 
AND THAT'S HOW I'VE GOT TO LASSO YOU YES WELL DON'T QUITE LASSO ME AT THE MOMENT 
NOT TILL AFTER I'VE VALUED IT YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE MY VALUATION SO YOU CAN LASSO ME 
STRING ME UP IN THE SALE ROOM YEAH IT'S A FASCINATING OBJECT 
FROM AN AUCTION POINT OF VIEW THE INTEREST LIES IN THE FACT THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT WACKY YEAH 
A LITTLE OUT OF THE ORDINARY I WOULD SAY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD FIND IT QUITE APPEALING 
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA ON EARTH WHAT IT'S GOING TO MAKE WE COULD HAVE A STAB AT IT 
AND PUT ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ON IT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
YOU NEVER KNOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PICK UP A PUNTER IN THE ROOM 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT OH YEAH I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY WITH THAT 
WE'LL PUT A RESERVE OF ONE HUNDRED WITH TEN PER CENT DISCRETION WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY FOR NOTHING 
BUT TELL ME I'M INTRIGUED YOU'VE HAD IT A LONG TIME YEAH 
WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO SELL IT NOW WELL MY DAUGHTERS THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN HORSES 
SO IT'S BETTER TO PASS IT ON TIME FOR IT TO GO AND FIND A NEW OWNER 
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH TONY I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AT THE AUCTION 
JILL HELLO THERE HELLO COULD YOU TELL ME A BIT ABOUT THE PIECE YOU'VE BROUGHT TO SHOW US 
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT HOW DID YOU COME BY IT AN ANTIQUE SHOP 
LOCALLY YES COWLEY ROAD ABOUT FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
WAS IT FOR YOURSELF OR AS A GIFT 
I DID BUY TWO AND GAVE MY SISTER ONE FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT 
WAS IT PERHAPS A PAIR TO THIS ONE 
NO IT WAS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT O. K. SO WE HAVEN'T GOT A SPLIT PAIR THAT WE COULD REUNITE 
NO THAT SORT OF TIES IN TO THE FACTORY PHILOSOPHY 
EVERY PIECE IS UNIQUE NO PAIRS 
IF WE TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN WE CAN SEE GOOD MARKS HERE ON THE BASE 
BURMANTOFT THEY WERE IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY MAKING THIS TYPE OF ART POTTERY SHALL WE SAY 
IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE OH I DO LIKE IT YES 
IT'S A SUPER SHAPE YES YOU'VE ALMOST GOT THAT DOUBLE GOURD SHAPE 
AND THEN THESE QUITE DELICATE HANDLES CONDITION IS VERY GOOD 
AND THE COLOUR DO YOU LIKE IT YES 
THIS WAS A GLAZE THIS OLIVE GREEN THAT WAS VERY FASHIONABLE IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
FOR THIS ART POTTERY 
IT'S ODD THAT THIS IS A FIRM WHO STARTED OFF MAKING SEWAGE PIPES OH AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
SIMILAR TO THE DOULTON FACTORY YOU SEE DOULTON WATERWORKS AND SEWAGE PIPES AGAIN 
BECAUSE OF THE OPENING MARKET FOR THIS TYPE OF WARES THEY MADE THEM 
HAVE YOU HAD IT VALUED AT ALL OR HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR IT 
TWO FOR TEN SHILLINGS SOUNDS CHEAP 
YOU DID WELL THERE SO IN MY OPINION REGARDING WORTH NOW 
FOR YOUR TEN SHILLINGS' INVESTMENT FOR TWO THIS ONE ON ITS OWN 
SHOULD BE WORTH IN THE REGION OF MAYBE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE HUNDRED SIXTY 
IS THAT AN ESTIMATE YOU WOULD BE HAPPY WITH NO I THINK ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YES THAT'S WITHIN MY ESTIMATE RIGHT 
IF WE PLAY THE BARTERING GAME AND I SAY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY WITH TEN PER CENT DISCRETION PERHAPS FOR THE AUCTIONEER 
YES I THINK I'D DO THAT O. K. THEN 
SO WE'VE SETTLED ON THAT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED WITH A DISCRETIONARY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY RESERVE 
WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO SELL IT NOW I DON'T KNOW REALLY 
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE YOUR SHOW WAS ON SO I BROUGHT SOME THINGS WITH ME 
I HOPE WE CAN GET MORE THAN THE ESTIMATE FOR IT AND YOU CAN REPLACE IT WITH A LARGER PIECE 
OH YES I'LL SEE YOU AT THE AUCTION FINGERS CROSSED THANKS VERY MUCH 
LET'S SEE IF THE VALUATIONS STAND UP TO SCRUTINY 
WILL IS HOPING THAT SLIGHT DAMAGE TO HILARY'S OPAL RING WON'T PUT OFF BIDDERS 
MARK'S FAVOURITE ITEM WAS THE LASSO BUT WILL IT PROVE JUST TOO UNUSUAL 
GILLIAN PAID JUST TWENTY FIVE P. FOR THIS BURMANTOFT VASE SO FINGERS CROSSED THERE SHOULD BE A MASSIVE PROFIT 
NOW THE JEWEL IN FLOG IT'S CROWN THE OPAL AND DIAMOND RING AND ALSO HILARY
