TRAFFIC LIGHTS THEY'RE SUCH A PART OF EVERYDAY LIFE 
WOULD YOU BELIEVE I'M ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THE FIRST AUTOMATIC 
TRAFFIC LIGHT WAS INTRODUCED TO GREAT BRITAIN 
I'M IN PRINCES SQUARE IN THE HEART OF WOLVERHAMPTON 
AND THE LIGHTS HAVE TURNED GREEN FOR FLOG IT 
WE'RE IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITY OUTSIDE WOLVERHAMPTON CIVIC HALL FOR OUR VALUATION TODAY 
EXPERTS CATHERINE SOUTHERN AND DAVID BARBY WILL BE RUMMAGING THROUGH 
ALL THE BAGS AND BOXES COMING UP WITH EXPERT VALUATIONS AND THEN 
IT'S OFF TO THE AUCTION ROOM TO PUT THEM TO THE TEST 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DAVID THAT WAS SPOT ON 
OH THAT'S BRILLIANT NEWS I'M SO PLEASED FOR YOU 
THIS IS A COME AND BUY ME FROM DAVID 
JUST DON'T RUB IN DON'T RUB IT IN 
FIRST LET'S GET EVERYONE INSIDE WHERE CATHERINE'S GOT THE DAY UNDERWAY 
BARBARA MARGARET THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY 
AND BRINGING YOUR LOVELY COLLECTION OF PELHAM PUPPETS 
LET'S GO THROUGH THEM AND HAVE A LOOK AT THEM IN DETAIL AND SEE WHO WE'VE GOT 
NOW FIRST OF ALL WE'VE GOT THIS COWGIRL HERE THAT'S COMPLETELY SLOUCHED ON THE BOX 
I THINK SHE'S EXHAUSTED AFTER HER DAY 
AND THEN ONE OF THE ONES I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IS THE LITTLE NODDY 
THEN THE THIRD ONE HERE IS A LITTLE COW OR BULL WHITE BULL 
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT YES IT'S FROM THE FILM THAT TOMMY STEELE MADE CALLED THE LITTLE WHITE BULL 
THERE WAS A SONG IN IT CALLED THE LITTLE WHITE BULL THAT'S WHERE IT COMES FROM 
FANTASTIC WHAT I THINK IS REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THESE IS WE'VE GOT THE DIFFERENCE HERE BETWEEN THESE TWO 
WHICH ARE THE BIGGER PUPPETS IN THE BIGGER BOXES AND THEN WE'VE GOT THIS LITTLE TINY ONE WHICH IS SOMETHING 
YOU DON'T SEE VERY OFTEN THE ONE THAT'S MADE FOR THE VERY YOUNG CHILD IT SAYS PRINTED ON THE BOX 
I'D HATE TO GIVE THIS TO MY LITTLE VERY YOUNG CHILD SHE'D RUIN IT 
THESE ARE ALL IN SUCH PERFECT CONDITION 
WHAT IS ALSO NICE ABOUT THIS IS THE CROSSBAR IS MUCH SMALLER 
FOR LITTLE HANDS TO OPERATE WHEREAS ON THESE TWO YOU'VE GOT THE MUCH BIGGER CROSSBAR 
WHERE DID YOU GET THEM HAVE THEY BEEN IN YOUR FAMILY THEY BELONG TO OUR SISTER 
WHO SADLY IS NO LONGER WITH US 
WE'VE DECIDED THAT IT'S TIME TO PART WITH SOME OF HER THINGS 
SO THEY WERE ACTUALLY PLAYED WITH BY YOUR SISTER YES YES 
SO YOU NEVER PLAYED WITH THE PELHAM PUPPETS NO NEVER 
THEY'RE IN SUCH PERFECT CONDITION IT'S AMAZING 
YOU OFTEN FIND LITTLE MOTH EATEN BITS OF FABRIC 
THESE ARE REALLY IN SUCH LOVELY CONDITION WHICH IS WONDERFUL 
NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO HAND THROUGH YOUR FAMILIES AT ALL 
BETWEEN US WE'VE GOT TOO MANY CHILDREN SO TO SHARE 
DIFFICULT TO SPLIT THEM YES 
SO THE TIME HAS COME TO SELL THEM ON LET SOMEBODY ELSE ENJOY THEM WELL I THINK THEY'RE WONDERFUL 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO PUT A PRICE ON THESE BECAUSE THEY DO GO UP AND DOWN 
SOMETIMES THEY'RE POPULAR AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT 
I WOULD PROBABLY PUT A COLLECTIVE ESTIMATE ON OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
HOW DOES THAT SOUND TO YOU 
IT'S AMAZING I WOULD THINK PROBABLY THESE ONES WOULD MAKE ABOUT FORTY EACH 
I WOULD HOPE THAT NODDY WOULD MAKE MORE HE'S SO LOVELY 
HE'S IN SUCH GOOD CONDITION THANKS FOR BRINGING THEM ALONG TODAY 
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE HOLD OF ONE AND TAKE IT TO THE AUCTION RIGHT 
IVOR 
THIS IS A MOST INTERESTING AREA 
YEAH IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CENTRE FOR GREAT INDUSTRY AND MANUFACTURE YEAH 
SO IN THE PAST AND IT PROBABLY STILL DOES IT ATTRACTS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WEALTH YEAH 
SO WHEN I LOOK AT THIS OBJECT HERE WHICH IS SOLID SILVER IT DOES REPRESENT AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY 
CAN YOU SHED ANY LIGHT ON ITS HISTORY 
MY WIFE'S GRANDMOTHER HAD IT AS A WEDDING PRESENT IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY WE BELIEVE 
IS THERE ANY HISTORY IN FRONT OF THAT 
OH YES IT'S BEEN PASSED DOWN FROM HER GRANDMOTHER TO THE MOTHER AND NOW TO THE DAUGHTER 
IF IT'S STANDING A LITTLE DISTANCE BACK AND YOU CAN SQUINT AT IT 
YOU CAN JUST SEE THE OUTLINE OF THAT SLIGHT BALUSTER FORM YES 
AND THIS WONDERFUL SCROLL HANDLE 
THIS IS PERFECTION PARTICULARLY THIS DECORATION HERE WHICH IS IN THE FORM OF AN ACANTHUS LEAF SCROLL 
YEAH IF ONLY THEY'D HAVE LEFT IT WITH THAT LOVELY HANDLE AND THE PLAIN BODY 
SOMEWHERE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT'S BEEN EMBELLISHED YES I CAN SEE THAT 
WITH THIS COUNTRY SCENE 
THAT HAS BEEN ADDED TO A VERY PLAIN SOPHISTICATED SHAPE YEAH 
WE CALL THIS WORK ENGRAVING BUT ALSO REPOUSSE 
WHERE IT IS KNOCKED OUT FROM THE INSIDE TO GIVE THE DESIGN 
BUT THAT TAKES AWAY ITS VALUE 
SO SOMEBODY THOUGHT IN THEIR WISDOM THEY WERE IMPROVING IT 
THAT'S RIGHT AND YOU'RE SAYING THEY'VE TAKEN THE VALUE AWAY THEY HAVEN'T IMPROVED IT 
THE MARK IS QUITE INTERESTING BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE 
WE'VE GOT THE LION HERE YEAH 
WHICH IS TO ESTABLISH IT'S SILVER 
YES 
THEN WE'VE GOT THE DATE LETTER WHICH IS ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY TWO 
AND WE THINK LONDON YEAH BUT THERE'S NO LEOPARD'S HEAD NO 
THERE TO TELL ME IT'S LONDON 
NOW ESTABLISHING A PRICE 
I WOULD SAY IF IT HAD NOT BEEN ENGRAVED MAYBE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND 
THAT ENGRAVING HAS DIMINISHED THE VALUE OH DEAR 
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN ADDED EMBELLISHED 
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT IT WAS THE OTHER WAY ROUND SO DID THE VICTORIANS 
IT MEANS YOU THINK IN TERMS OF AROUND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED THAT SORT OF PRICE RANGE 
I THINK THE AUCTIONEERS WILL SUGGEST WE PUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY AS RESERVE NO LESS 
THAT WILL BE AGREEABLE TO YOU YEAH YEAH 
IVOR I HOPE I'M PROVED WRONG AND IT GOES SAILING UP BUT I THINK MY RESERVATIONS WILL BE CONFIRMED 
WHAT A HANDSOME CHAP THIS COCKEREL IS 
WHERE DID YOU GET HIM FROM 
I BOUGHT HIM IN BIRMINGHAM QUITE LOCAL IS THAT QUITE RECENTLY 
OH NO ABOUT THIRTY THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE AWARE BUT THIS IS REALLY QUITE A NICE PIECE YOU'VE GOT HERE 
HE'S A LOVELY COCKEREL OR HE'S ACTUALLY KNOWN AS THE GAMECOCK 
THAT'S HIS PROPER NAME 
CAN I ASK YOU HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT YOU PAID FOR HIM THEN 
NO IDEA CAN'T REMEMBER IT'S QUITE A LONG TIME AGO IT IS 
WHAT APPEALED TO YOU ABOUT HIM 
COLOURS AND THE SHAPE YOU KNOW THE COLOURS OF HIM 
VERY STRIKING AREN'T THEY 
THEY REALLY JUMP OUT AT YOU DO YOU COLLECT BESWICK 
I HAVE DONE IN THE PAST YES HOW MANY PIECES DO YOU HAVE 
WITH THE COCK I HAVE ABOUT EIGHT PIECES 
IS HE ONE OF YOUR MORE FAVOURITE PIECES YES HE'S A LARGER ONE 
HE'S VERY STRIKING ISN'T HE HE LOOKS IN ABSOLUTE PERFECT CONDITION 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS SO EASY TO BREAK 
BECAUSE OF THAT THE PRICES OF THESE ARE QUITE HIGH AND THEY ARE QUITE COLLECTIBLE 
ANY IDEAS ON PRICE OF THIS NO NONE WHATSOEVER NO 
WELL I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS AT AUCTION 
YOU COULD PROBABLY ASK BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED 
NEVER BUT I THINK IT SHOULD MAKE A LOT MORE 
DO YOU I HOPE IT WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE 
THAT'S GREAT THAT SURPRISES YOU 
IT DOES IT DOES YES IT'S PURELY AND SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S IN GREAT CONDITION 
WHERE HAS IT BEEN DISPLAYED ALL THIS TIME ON A SHELF 
YEAH ALL THE YEARS ON THE SHELF BUT I ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF IT 
YEAH I CAN SEE THAT I CAN SEE THAT I LOVE IT 
NOW GILLIAN WHY DO YOU WANT TO LET HIM GO 
WELL AT MY AGE WE HAVE TO DE CLUTTER 
I DON'T THINK THE FAMILY WILL WANT TO KEEP THEM 
SO IF WE CAN SELL THEM AND GET A NICE FAIR PRICE FOR THEM WE CAN SHARE THE MONEY 
SO HE'S HAD HIS DAY YOU'VE HAD HIM FOR A WHILE YOU'VE LOOKED AFTER HIM YES 
NOW IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO LEAVE THE NEST YES 
RIGHT WE'LL PUT HIM AT AUCTION WE'LL PUT HIM AT THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED 
I HOPE THAT HE FLIES AWAY THANK YOU GILLIAN RIGHT THANK YOU

OH YES YES WHAT PART OF THE STATES 
WASHINGTON WASHINGTON D. C. 
WIGHTWICK MANOR SITUATED THREE MILES OUTSIDE OF WOLVERHAMPTON 
WAS GIVEN TO THE NATIONAL TRUST BY SIR GEOFFREY MANDER AND HIS SECOND WIFE ROSALIE IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN 
INCLUDED IN THE GIFT WAS THEIR FANTASTIC COLLECTION OF PAINTINGS PART OF WHICH REFLECTED 
LADY ROSALIE MANDER'S PASSIONATE INTEREST IN THE PRE RAPHAELITES 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE JUST HOW UNPOPULAR PRE RAPHAELITE PAINTINGS WERE DURING THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY 
THE PUBLIC VIEWED THE BROTHERHOOD AS A BUNCH OF ROMANTIC RADICALS 
THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT THEY WANTED SOMETHING MORE CONTEMPORARY AND MODERN 
SO LADY MANDER WAS IN A VERY GOOD POSITION BECAUSE SELLERS BEAT A PATH 
TO HER DOOR AND SHE WAS BUYING AT THE LOWER END OF THE MARKET SO THAT WAS A GOOD THING 
I'VE COME TO TALK TO PAT VAUGHN WHO HAS BEEN A VOLUNTEER HERE FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS 
AND SHE ACTUALLY KNEW LADY MANDER BEFORE HER DEATH IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT PAT IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU HELLO PAUL 
THIS MUST FEEL LIKE HOME TO YOU BEING HERE TWENTY ODD YEARS IT DOES SO WHAT WAS LADY MANDER LIKE 
VERY VIVACIOUS VERY CHARMING BUT VERY PRIVATE 
LET'S START WITH THIS ONE BEHIND US OVER THE PIANO 
IT'S TYPICAL OF WHAT YOU EXPECT OF A PRE RAPHAELITE PAINTING 
INDEED IT IS A DANTE ROSSETTI 
YES BUT I RECOGNISE JANEY MORRIS THERE THAT'S WILLIAM MORRIS'S WIFE 
BUT JANEY HAD DARK BROWN HAIR SO WHO'S GIVEN HER RED HAIR 
FORD MADOX BROWN WHO FINISHED THE PAINTING 
AFTER ROSSETTI'S DEATH 
THAT EXPLAINS WHY THE BRUSH STROKES DON'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE ROSSETTI'S YES 
IT WAS FINISHED IN THE LAST YEAR OF MADOX BROWN'S LIFE 
SO WHY DID HE GIVE JANEY MORRIS RED HAIR I THINK IT WAS A REFERENCE 
FIRST OF ALL HIS GENERAL LOVE OF RED HAIR DANTE'S 
AND BECAUSE OF HIS WIFE LIZZIE SIDDAL HAD RED HAIR 
IT WAS THE FIRST PRE RAPHAELITE IN THE COLLECTION 
SO THIS STARTED OFF THE LOVE AFFAIR IT DID HOW MUCH DID SHE PAY FOR IT CAN YOU REMEMBER 
SEVENTEEN POINT ONE OH SHILLINGS THAT WAS A BARGAIN YES SHALL WE GO AND SEE SOME MORE 
INDEED I CAN'T WAIT ACTUALLY 
I FEEL LIKE A KID IN A SWEETSHOP 
PAT YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO SHOW ME A MILLAIS 
I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING ON THE SCALE OF THE LADY OF THE LAKE 
SOMETHING SORT OF THAT BIG BUT THIS IS ALMOST LIKE A MINIATURE IT IS TELL ME ABOUT IT 
WELL IT'S OF EFFIE RUSKIN 
RUSKIN TOOK MILLAIS AWAY ON A SCOTTISH HOLIDAY TO INFLUENCE HIS PAINTING 
AND MILLAIS FELL IN LOVE WITH RUSKIN'S WIFE 
OH OH YES 
THERE WAS AN ANNULMENT CASE COS THE MARRIAGE WAS SUPPOSED NOT TO HAVE BEEN CONSUMMATED 
OVER A PERIOD OF SIX YEARS WHICH IS VERY THAT WAS A BIT TRICKY HOW DID THEY GET AWAY WITH THAT 
EXACTLY AND I THINK IT WAS THE ONLY WAY THEY COULD DISSOLVE A MARRIAGE ANYWAY IN THOSE DAYS 
SHE'S WEARING FOXGLOVES IN HER HAIR THERE WHICH I THINK IS AN EXTRAORDINARY HAIR ORNAMENT 
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PICTURE IT IS WHEN DID THEY ACQUIRE THIS 
NINETEEN FORTY NINE IT WAS BOUGHT FROM A MEMBER OF THE MILLAIS FAMILY 
OH THAT'S NICE THIS MIGHT BE A TRICKY QUESTION TO ASK YOU 
BUT HOW MANY WORKS ARE THERE IN THE COLLECTION IS THERE A LOT THAT THE PUBLIC CAN'T SEE IN PORTFOLIOS 
NOT A VAST AMOUNT WE DO HAVE SOME PORTFOLIOS MAINLY OF ROSSETTI DRAWINGS 
STUDIES YES WELL SHALL WE GO AND SEE SOME MORE 
LET'S INDEED O. K. I'LL FOLLOW YOU 
HERE PAT LET'S TAKE A SEAT HERE 
NOW YOU'VE BROUGHT ME HERE TO SHOW ME A PEN AND INK DRAWING WHICH IS NOT WHAT WE'D EXPECT FROM ROSSETTI 
AND I GATHER THIS IS YOUR FAVOURITE 
WELL I LOVE THIS BECAUSE IT SHOWS THEY WEREN'T THE SOLEMN PEOPLE WE THINK THEY WERE REAL PARTYGOERS 
OH INDEED INDEED 
SO SET THE SCENE WHAT'S HAPPENING 
IT'S SUPPOSED TO SHOW HER HAVING A BAD REVIEW OF ALL OF HER POEMS GOBLIN MARKET IN FACT 
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
SHE'S IN A RAGE SHE'S THROWING THINGS AROUND THE KITCHEN 
IN FACT IT WASN'T A BAD REVIEW 
IT WAS PRAISING THE POEM SHE'S OBVIOUSLY HAD LOTS OF BAD REVIEWS AND DOESN'T LIKE 
SHE HATES LOOKING AT REVIEWS WE THINK IT'S DOWN TO GABRIEL HELPING HER TO HAVE A LAUGH ABOUT THIS 
IT MUST BE REALLY HARD TO HAVE A FAVOURITE PIECE 
BECAUSE YOU JUST LOOK AROUND AND YOU THINK WHAT DO YOU CHOOSE WELL I CHANGE ALL THE TIME 
DO YOU KNOW I'D DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING EVERY DAY I'D HAVE A DIFFERENT FAVOURITE YES 
I DON'T BLAME YOU PAT 
SHALL I PUT THAT BACK RIGHT 
AND LET'S CARRY ON THE TOUR 
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT TO SHOW ME 
COME OVER HERE O. K. 
LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK 
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE IT LOOKS LIKE A BURNE JONES ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE BROTHERHOOD 
IT IS A BURNE JONES HE WAS NEVER A MEMBER OF THE BROTHERHOOD OH WASN'T HE 
NOT ACTUALLY NOT AN OFFICIAL ONE IT REALLY IS I SUPPOSE THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN HERE 
IT'S A VERY IMPRESSIVE FRAME IT'S ALMOST NEO CLASSICAL 
LOTS GOING ON THERE ISN'T IT 
HE WAS VERY FOND OF THIS KIND OF FRAME 
YOU CAN IDENTIFY HIS WORK BY THE FRAMES YOU CAN TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YES 
ALTHOUGH I THINK BURNE JONES IS VERY VERY EASY TO IDENTIFY 
BUT IT'S NOT AN ARTS AND CRAFTS FRAME OH NO 
SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S IT CALLED LOVE AMONGST THE RUINS 
OH THERE'S A BIT OF SYMBOLISM AS WELL LOOK YOU'VE GOT EMBRACED IN LOVE THE RUINS FALLING DOWN 
THINGS HAVE BROKEN DOWN AND LOTS OF SORT OF ROSES WITH THORNS 
I THINK HE'S TRYING TO SHOW THE EPHEMERAL NATURE OF LOVE 
WELL SO I'M TOLD 
WHEN DID THEY ACQUIRE THIS WELL IT WAS BROUGHT IN BY THE TRUST 
THIS WASN'T BOUGHT BY THE MANDERS OH O. K. 
IT'S NOT THE SORT OF THING THAT LADY MANDER COLLECTED 
NO BURNE JONES PAINTED A LOT IN WATERCOLOURS AS WELL 
HE DID WELL THIS IS THE FOURTH AND LAST VERSION HE PAINTED OF THIS 
THERE WAS A WATERCOLOUR AND A GOUACHE WHICH GOT DAMAGED IN A PARIS PHOTOGRAPHER'S STUDIO 
THERE WAS GOING TO BE AN EXHIBITION AND SOMEONE THE STORY GOES DECIDED TO CLEAN IT 
AND THEY CLEANED ONE OF THE FACES AND OF COURSE BEING WATERCOLOUR AND GOUACHE IT CAME AWAY 
ABSOLUTELY WHAT A PLACE TO START 
YOU'D THINK THEY'D START IN THE CORNER WOULDN'T YOU MAYBE THEY DID I DON'T KNOW 
ANYWAY BURNE JONES HAS DECIDED TO RECREATE THIS PICTURE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ONE WAS PAINTED 
OBVIOUSLY MEANT A LOT TO HIM THIS TIME HE DID IT IN OILS 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING ISN'T IT I LOVE THOSE DEEP PRUSSIAN BLUES THEY'RE QUITE VIVID 
WELL THEY ARE YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF BLUE AS A COLOUR WHICH GLOWED WOULD YOU NO NO 
I THINK IT SHOWS ONE OF HIS WHAT I THINK OF HIS GREAT STRENGTHS 
HE HAD A WONDERFUL SENSE OF COMPOSITION AND DESIGN 
DEFINITELY YES PAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MY VERY OWN PERSONAL MINI GRAND TOUR 
IT'S BEEN DELIGHTFUL I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE PRE RAPHAELITE WORK 
I JUST WISH I WAS BORN AT A TIME WHEN I COULD BELONG TO THE BROTHERHOOD BUT I CAN'T FIX THAT 
I THINK I'D FIT IN REALLY WELL BECAUSE MY HEAD IS DEFINITELY 
IN THE CLOUDS BUT MY FEET ARE FIRMLY ON THE GROUND 
AND I'M CONSTANTLY CHASING THE HOLY GRAIL HAVEN'T GOT ONE OF THOSE I'M AFRAID 
BACK AT THE VALUATION DAY DAVID'S HEADING DOWN MEMORY LANE 
MEL I HAVE TO OFFER AN APOLOGY FOR KEEPING YOU WAITING SO LONG 
HAS IT BEEN A SORT OF GREAT BURDEN TO YOU 
NOT REALLY BECAUSE WHILE I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE I USED TO COME HERE WHEN I WAS IN MY TEENAGE YEARS 
AROUND ABOUT EIGHTEEN AND IT HASN'T CHANGED MUCH REALLY 
IT'S MORE OR LESS THE SAME AS WHEN I CAME HERE THEN 
AND WHAT DID YOU COME HERE FOR DANCING IT WAS THE DANCING 
THEY USED TO HAVE GROUPS THAT WERE JUST STARTING OUT 
I'M PLEASED IT'S BROUGHT BACK THOSE HAPPY MEMORIES YOU BROUGHT THIS WHICH BELONGS TO YOUR MOTHER 
THAT'S RIGHT YES SO WHY'S SHE WANTING TO GET RID OF IT SHE'S MOVED INTO SHELTERED ACCOMMODATION 
AND SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT IT GETTING BROKEN IN TRANSPORT 
SHE'D ALWAYS SAID IT WAS MINE AND SHE SAYS YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE IT NOW 
OH THIS IS AWFUL NOW YOU ARE CONSIDERING SELLING IT YEAH WELL WHY 
IT'S SUCH A SHAME BECAUSE IT'S IN LIKE A CABINET AND IT'S NOT REALLY BEING USED OR SEEN BY ANYBODY 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS PRETTY CHINA THAT SHOULD BE ON DISPLAY YES 
THIS IS A WONDERFUL DESIGN IT'S CALLED MELODY 
THE FACTORY THAT PRODUCED THIS WAS SHELLEY 
NOW THE SHELLEY FACTORY GOES BACK SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME WAY BACK INTO 
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN THE ORIGINAL COMPANY WAS CALLED WILEMAN AND COMPANY YES 
THEN IT CHANGED ITS NAME TO FOLEY CHINA AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED AT THAT TIME WAS J. B. SHELLEY 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE HE TOOK OVER AND IT BECAME KNOWN AS SHELLEY CHINA OH RIGHT 
AND ONE OF THE RANGES THAT THEY PRODUCED DURING THE NINETEEN THIRTIES WAS THIS RANGE 
OF CHINTZY PATTERNED CHINA WHICH WAS VERY VERY FASHIONABLE 
NOW THIS IS NOT AS POPULAR AS IT USED TO BE SAY FIVE YEARS AGO 
THE MARKET HAS CHANGED IT'S MOVED ON TO NINETEEN FIFTIES PORCELAIN YES 
SO THIS IS LEFT SOMEWHAT BEHIND BUT THERE ARE STILL COLLECTORS OF IT 
AND I WOULD THINK AT AUCTION THIS WOULD SELL FOR SOMETHING IN THE REGION OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
I HOPE MORE RIGHT YES NO REGRETS ABOUT SELLING IT NO NOT REALLY 
I MEAN IT IS BEAUTIFUL BUT IT'S NO GOOD JUST SORT OF LOOKING AT IT 
LET'S HOPE WE MAKE WELL ABOVE THE LOWEST ESTIMATES THAT I'VE GIVEN YOU OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
THE AUCTIONEERS MAY DECIDE TO PUT AN AUCTION RESERVE JUST TUCKED UNDER THAT YES WOULD THAT BE AGREEABLE 
THAT'S FINE YES THAT'S FINE YES 
STEVE AND CAROL THANK YOU FOR COMING ALONG TODAY AND BRINGING THIS FABULOUS PIECE 
AS SOON AS I SAW IT I THOUGHT KEITH MURRAY THAT'S MADE MY DAY NOW TELL ME WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM 
WELL IT WAS A WEDDING PRESENT FROM MY MOTHER IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT 
AND SHE MOVED TO AUSTRALIA IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES 
AND LEFT IT WITH ME AND IT'S MOVED AROUND WITH US FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL IT'S JUST A STUNNING CLASSIC SHAPE 
IT REALLY APPEALS TO ME DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT KEITH MURRAY AT ALL 
WELL ONLY THAT HE WAS AN ARCHITECT I BELIEVE FROM NEW ZEALAND 
WHO WAS INVITED BY WEDGWOOD TO DESIGN SOME VASES 
THAT'S RIGHT OR SOME PIECES AND THIS WAS THE RESULT 
AND I BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER COLOURS AS WELL 
YES HE WAS ACTUALLY BORN IN NEW ZEALAND AND THEN HE MOVED QUITE EARLY IN LIFE TO ENGLAND 
AND DID TRAIN FIRST OF ALL AS AN ARCHITECT BUT DIDN'T HIT IT OFF AS AN ARCHITECT 
SO HE THOUGHT HE'D TRY HIS HAND IN DESIGNING POTTERY AND HERE WE ARE HE DID VERY WELL INDEED 
HE WENT OFF TO WORK FOR WEDGWOOD IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES SO THIS IS QUITE A NICE EARLY PIECE 
IT'S SUCH A CLASSIC DESIGN AND THIS WONDERFUL IVORY COLOUR 
BUT I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED MOONSTONE I THINK THAT IS THE CORRECT STONE COLOUR MOONSTONE 
WHICH IS REALLY QUITE NICE BUT I LOVE THIS LITTLE RIPPLED EFFECT 
NOW IT'S BEEN IN YOUR FAMILY FOR SUCH A LONG TIME WHY ON DO YOU WANT TO GET RID OF IT 
IT MUST HAVE SENTIMENTAL CONNECTIONS WELL I'VE GOT OTHER THINGS 
THAT HAVE GOT SENTIMENTAL CONNECTIONS WITH MY MOTHER WHICH ARE MORE PERTINENT 
YOU'VE MADE UP YOUR MIND 
YES WELL IT'S OUR RUBY WEDDING IN NOVEMBER SO IT'LL HOPEFULLY GO TOWARDS A CELEBRATION OH LOVELY 
OH THAT WOULD BE NICE WOULDN'T IT 
YES FANTASTIC HAVE YOU ANY IDEA ON PRICE ON THIS 
WELL WE HAD IT VALUED SOME TIME AGO AND WE THOUGHT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED 
RIGHT I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA BE QUITE AS MUCH AS THAT 
IF IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION I THINK YOU'D BE LOOKING AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED 
BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A BIT LESS THAN THAT 
NOW THE REASON THAT I'M SAYING THAT IS HAVING A LOOK AROUND I CAN SEE THAT THERE'S A BIT OF STAINING HERE 
NEVERTHELESS I THINK LET'S PUT IT IN A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND REALLY HOPE THAT IT TAKES OFF YES 
ARE YOU STILL HAPPY TO GIVE IT A GO YES ABSOLUTELY YOU WANT RID HE'S MADE UP HIS MIND HAS HE 
HE IS A MAN THAT ONCE HE MAKES HIS DECISION THAT'S IT 
WELL YOU HAVE TO DO THAT DON'T YOU YOU DO SIR YOU DO 
LINDA ON THESE FLOG IT PROGRAMMES THERE'S ALWAYS AN ELEMENT OF 
EXCITEMENT FROM SOME OF THE OBJECTS THAT ARE BROUGHT IN 
AND THIS FOR ME IS A HIGH POINT ALL THIS JEWELLERY 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
AND IT ALL DATES FROM AROUND ABOUT THE SAME PERIOD WHICH IS THE MIDDLE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
NOW WHO DID THIS BELONG TO 
THIS BELONGED TO MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER WHO CAME FROM LUXEMBOURG 
AH THAT IS WONDERFUL BECAUSE IT SHOWS SO MUCH FLAIR 
SO SHE CAME FROM LUXEMBOURG AND I THINK A LOT OF THESE PIECES 
ARE ACTUALLY FROM ITALY THAT'S SURPRISING I DIDN'T KNOW THAT 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL IT 
THE PIECES ARE LOVELY BUT THEY ARE VERY ORNATE 
AND RATHER LARGE THAT'S TRUE 
I DON'T THINK I'D EVER WEAR THEM THEY LOOK SLIGHTLY OTT DON'T THEY 
YES THEY DO RIGHT NOW WHERE DO WE START 
WELL IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF THE HISTORY OF JEWELLERY BACK IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THERE WAS A GREAT REVIVAL FROM ITALY OF WHAT WE TERM AS THE 
ETRUSCAN STYLE SO IF YOU LOOK TO THAT MARVELLOUS 
SERIES ON THE GOGGLEBOX CALLED THE ROMANS YOU MIGHT SEE SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT THIS ACTUALLY WORN BY ONE OF THE FEMALE CAST 
BECAUSE THIS IS A COPY OF AN ANCIENT ROMAN NECKLACE 
I'VE HAD A LOOK AT IT IT'S UNMARKED BUT THE QUALITY IS SUCH THAT IT IS GOLD YES 
GOLD LOVELY LOVELY LOVELY 
IF WE GO AROUND WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THIS LOVELY LITTLE SET HERE 
THE ONLY THING WE'RE MISSING IS A WHACKING GREAT NECKLACE 
YES THAT WOULD BE THE COMPANION TO THE BROOCH 
THE BRACELET AND THESE TWO DROP EARRINGS 
AND ON EACH SECTION THERE'S THESE DELIGHTFUL SORT OF LAUREL LEAVES OR VICTORY LEAVES 
AND EACH ONE IS FILLED WITH ENAMEL WHITE ENAMEL 
THESE TURQUOISE LOOKING BOSSES ARE ALSO ENAMEL 
IMITATING THE TURQUOISE STONE 
AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE WE HAVE A GOLD STAR 
WHICH IS SET WITH THE MOST WONDERFUL RIVER PEARLS 
NOW RIVER PEARLS FROM MUSSEL SHELLS ARE GREY IN TONE SO THIS IS THIS 
VERY VERY NICE SUBTLE SHADE OF GREY THAT YOU GET WITH RIVER PEARLS 
YEAH COS I THOUGHT THEY WERE SEA PEARLS AH RIGHT 
OF ALL THE PIECES THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A KNOCKOUT 
BECAUSE THIS IS ITALIAN AND AS YOU KNOW THE ITALIANS 
PARTICULARLY THE ANCIENT ROMANS WERE ABLE TO PRODUCE THE MOST WONDERFUL TESSERAE PAVEMENTS YES 
THIS IS A SIMILAR FORM OF MINUTE TESSERAE 
BUT IN SEMI PRECIOUS STONES TO CREATE THIS 
DELIGHTFUL CREATION OF FLOWER HEADS SCROLL WORK AND OTHER DETAILS 
AND THIS IS THE COMPLETE SET SO WE HAVE THIS PENDANT 
AND THEN WE HAVE THESE TWO EARRINGS AND THE LEAF SHAPED BOX IS WONDERFUL 
THEN THERE'S TWO OTHER PIECES WHICH I FIND VERY ORNATE AND POSSIBLY SLIGHTLY LATER THAN THE OTHERS 
AGAIN ITALIAN WITH QUITE HIGH RELIEF TESSERAE 
AND I NOTE THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF DAMAGE 
IN OTHER WORDS SMALL STONES THAT ARE MISSING 
THIS PIECE IS INTRIGUING BECAUSE IT'S SET WITH TURQUOISE STONES 
AS OPPOSED TO ENAMEL WHICH IS ON THE OTHER PIECES 
AND YOU HAVE THIS DELICATE PIERCED FILIGREE WORK ALL THE WAY ROUND WHICH IS NOT COMMON TO 
ENGLISH JEWELLERY BUT TO BE FOUND IN THE SOUTH MEDITERRANEAN AREA 
BUT WHAT I FIND INTRIGUING ABOUT THIS PIECE 
WHICH IS A PENDANT AND IF I TURN IT OVER 
ON THE BACK THERE IS PROVISION FOR PUTTING A MINIATURE 
A PHOTOGRAPH OR MAYBE WOVEN HAIR OF YOUR LOVED ONE 
NOW BEFORE PUTTING A PRICE ON WE'VE GOT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DAMAGE 
THERE'S ONE EARRING WHERE THE BOSS IS LOOSE 
THAT LITTLE BROOCH IS A LITTLE BIT LOOSE 
THOSE STONES HAVE COME OUT OF THAT BROOCH 
SO I'M GOING TO PUT A PRICE THAT WILL ACCOMMODATE A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST 
SO I'M GOING TO SAY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED 
BUT I CAN SEE THAT SUM BEING EXCEEDED YES 
WHAT I DON'T WANT IS A TOO HIGH FIGURE THAT'S GOING TO NOT CREATE THE INTEREST REQUIRED RIGHT YES 
SO THIS IS WHY I'M PUTTING A BLANKET FIGURE ON THE WHOLE LOT 
AND THEN WE CAN LEAVE THAT UP TO THE AUCTIONEER 
TO SORT OUT HOW HE WILL SELL IT AND HE KNOWS BEST YES 
SO I THINK WITHIN THOSE PARAMETERS I DON'T WANT A RESERVE LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
BUT I'M SURE I'M QUITE CONFIDENT THAT WILL BE EXCEEDED I HOPE SO 
AND NOW FOR A QUICK REMINDER OF WHAT OUR EXPERTS HAVE UNCOVERED IN WOLVERHAMPTON 
MELANIE'S HIGHLY DECORATIVE SHELLEY TEA SET WAS HIDDEN AWAY 
IT'S SO PRETTY IT REALLY SHOULD BE ON DISPLAY 
AS SHOULD THIS KEITH MURRAY MOONSTONE VASE 
WHICH CRIES OUT FOR A DRAMATIC SETTING 
AND FINALLY AN EXTRAORDINARY FIND BY DAVID A WEALTH OF 
CONTINENTAL JEWELLERY WHICH CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A TOTAL KNOCKOUT 
LET'S SEE IF OUR AUCTIONEER NICHOLAS AGREES 
LINDA CAME INTO THE VALUATION DAY WITH A WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF JEWELLERY RIGHT 
NOW DAVID DID THE VALUATION AND HE PUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED 
ON THE WHOLE LOT INCLUDING THIS LOVELY MICRO MOSAIC WORK RIGHT 
NOW HAVE YOU SPLIT THE LOTS UP THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'VE DONE 
I'VE SPLIT IT INTO FOUR SEPARATE LOTS 
AND THIS IN THE GROUP OF THE JEWELLERY IS JUST ONE LOT 
IT'S THE BEST OF THE JEWELLERY SO I'VE PUT IT IN AS THE FIRST LOT DID YOU 
OBVIOUSLY YOU DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR DID YOU DIVIDE THE PRICE INTO FOUR HAVE WE GOT THE PRICE RIGHT 
NO I HAVE UPPED THE ESTIMATE A LITTLE BIT A TAD 
I MEAN DAVID IS VERY GOOD ON HIS CERAMICS THE JEWELLERY 
I FEEL THIS IS IT'S NOT HIS STRONGEST POINT IS IT 
IT'S NOT HIS STRONGEST POINT THIS IS ITALIAN MICRO MOSAIC WORK 
IT'S GORGEOUS STUNNING 
THE DETAIL IN THIS IT'S MADE UP OF HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS 
IN THIS EXAMPLE OF TESSERAE WHICH ARE TINY LITTLE BITS OF GLASS 
AND THEY'RE ALL PUT ON ALMOST LIKE A PUTTY BASE INTO THE GOLD MOUNTS 
AND YOU HAVE TO THINK WHEN THIS WAS MADE AROUND ABOUT WHERE ARE WE PROBABLY AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY MAYBE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY 
NO ELECTRICITY WORKING BY GASLIGHT 
MUST HAVE TAKEN HOURS MUST HAVE TAKEN HOURS 
SO YOU'VE TALKED IT UP I HAVE 
WE KNOW HOW PRECIOUS THIS IS O. K. WHAT COULD YOU SEE THIS DOING THEN 
HAVING TALKED IT UP I'VE PUT IT IN AT SIX HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED 
JUST THIS PIECE ALONE 
WOW AND I THINK I'M BEING CONSERVATIVE 
COULD THIS DO A COUPLE OF THOUSAND POUNDS IT DOES HAVE THE POTENTIAL 
THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE I HOPE LINDA LOVES IT TOO 
FINGERS CROSSED WE ARE GONNA BE IN FOR THE MOST WONDERFUL SURPRISE 
SO WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T GO AWAY 
JUST WATCH THE AUCTION
