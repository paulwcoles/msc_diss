FUTURE SOME PEOPLE THINK IT IS ALL 
OVER HAPPILY STEVE ISN'T ONE OF 
THEM BUT HE HAS WORK TO DO AGAINST 
STUART BINGHAM 
STEWARD LOOKED PRIDE OF A BUTTON 
THIS MORNING BUT STEVE LOOKED AS 
THOUGH HE HAD GOT OUT OF BED THE 
WRONG SIDE THIS WAS AS BAD AS 
SESSION OF SNOOKER AS STEVE HAS 
PROBABLY EVER PLAYED HERE 
A CATALOGUE OF MISSES AS HE 
PRESENTED CHANCE AFTER CHANCE TO 
BINGHAM THE MAN FROM BASILDON WAS 
HAPPY TO ACCEPT STEVE SCORED HAS

HE NEEDS A GOOD START 
SIX TO THREE BEHIND 
WHAT INFORMATION WILL 
HE TAKE ON AN AFTERNOON OF STEPHEN 
HENDRY COMING FROM THREE DOWN AND 
WINNING A THIRTY NINE YEAR OLD PROVED HE 
CAN BE DONE 
A PLASTIC PERFORMANCE 
FROM STEPHEN ONCE AGAIN A GOOD 
START IS IMPORTANT FANTASTIC 
PERFORMANCE 
THERE MUST BE A POINT PERFORMANCE WHERE EX CHAMPION IS THINK IT MUST 
BE TIME 
HE WON'T THINK OF THAT IF 
HE GOES IN AT THREE TO ONE IT IS BRILLIANT 
LET'S GET PAUL FOUR ON OUR PLAYERS

LEADING SIX TO THREE PLEASE WELCOME STUART 
BINGHAM 
AND AN ALL TIME GREAT TWENTY EIGHT RANKING 
TITLES SIX WORLD TITLES THERE ONE 
THE ONLY STEVE DAVIS 
WHAT'S AN OVATION FOR STEVE DAVIS 
YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH MATCH TO WATCH 
BY PRESSING THE RED BUTTON JOHN 
VIRGO AND WILLIE THORNE ARE 
COMMENTATING 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS 
ONE STEPHEN NEEDS BETTER START THAN THIS MORNING 
WITH THAT RECEPTION AND THE 
ATMOSPHERE IT MAY SUIT STEVE MORE 
THAN STUART 
YES IT IS KEY FOR 
STUART TO GET A REASONABLE START 
THIS EVENING IF IT GETS VERY VERY 
CLOSE YOU KNOW WHO SIDE THE CROWD 
MIGHT BE ON WHO WAS SIDE A CHOICE OF GREEN OR YELLOW 
HE JUST HAD TO AVOID THE BLUE HE 
MANAGED IT WELL BUT HE HASN'T COME 
INCH PERFECT ON THE RED THE ONE TO 
THE RIGHT OF THE BLACK IS A VERY 
THIN CUT 
THE EASIER RED IS THE ONE HE WAS 
LOOKING AT BUT HE REGULARLY HAS TO 
SCREW THE RED IN WITH RIGHT HAND 
SIDE 
WELL PLAYED TO GO ROUND THE BACK OF 
THE BLACK BUT ONLY A SAFETY SHOT 
TO COME NOW 
HE WON'T BE HAPPY WITH ONLY GETTING 
FOUR PONDS POINTS 
A GOOD POT BUT NOT THE BEST CUE 
BALL 
A GOOD RECOVERY HE WAS PLAYING FOR 
THE ONLY RED AVAILABLE HE CAN GO 
INTO THE BUNCH FROM ONLY BLUE 
YELLOW OR GREEN 
HE WENT UP THE BLUE MISSED IT BY A 
DISTANCE SO IT IS OFF THE YELLOW 
HE JUST ABOUT CAUGHT THEM AND HE IS 
O. K. DIDN'T HIT THEM AS FULL AS HE 
INTENDED 
IT LOOKS DIFFICULT TO HOLD FOR THE 
BLACK 
IT ALWAYS HAPPENS IN THE FIRST 
FRAME IT IS HARD TO GET THE PACE 
OF THE TABLE HE CAN'T GET ON THE 
LOOSE RED FROM THE BLUE HE CAN GET 
ON IT FROM THE GREEN BUT IT IS A 
TOUGH 
SHOT THERE 
MAY 
BE A 
PLANT IN 
THE LEFT CORNER HE WILL HOPE THERE 
IS BECAUSE AS YOU SAY HE ISN'T 
GOOD ON THE BLUE 
THAT WAS MISSABLE YOU DESERVE WHAT 
YOU GET AFTER THAT SHOT SO NEAR 
THE CUSHION IT IS EASY TO PUSH INTO 
THE BALL AND VISIT THAT WAS FIRST 
CLASS AND MISS IT 
AGAIN IT JUST OVERMAN I DON'T 
KNOW BEEN HE IF HE CAN CANNON 
INTO THE CLUSTER 
THE 
BLACK THE OPPOSITE CORNER CAN HE 
GET INTO THE CUE BALL ENOUGH 
HE DIDN'T PLAY THE CANNON AND HE 
DIDN'T PLAY THE POT VERY WELL THINK HE HAS LEFT IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY VERY EASY TO 
ROLL THAT RED IN BUT HE WOULDN'T 
HAVE FOUND THE ANGLE ON THE BLUE 
THAT IS WHY IT LOOK LIKE A BAD MISS 
BUT HE WAS TRYING TO DO THINGS WITH 
THE CUE BALL ROLLING IT IN WAS NO 
GOOD 
THAT WAS TOO THIN SO STEVE HAS A 
SECOND CHANCE 
THAT IS HANDY FOR STEVE THE PINK 
SPOT NOT AVAILABLE GOING OFF THE 
BLACK SPOT SUITS HIM FINE 
STEVE OBVIOUSLY THINKS THERE IS A 
THREE BALL PLANT IN THE MIDDLE THE 
ANGLE HE HAS LEFT I THINK HE MIGHT 
GO FOR THE PLANT 
HE HAS A ELECTED TO PLAY FOR THE 
THREE BALL PLANT THERE IS A BIT OF 
GAP BETWEEN THE THREE REDS AND 
PARTICULARLY THE SECOND AND THIRD 
HE HAS CONVINCED HIMSELF IT IS ON 
THERE IS THE GAP 
NOW HE HAS GONE FROM THE THREE BALL 
PLANT TO LEAVE A TWO BALL PLANT L. 
DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE HAS THE ANGLE 
TO GET INTO THEM HERE BUT THAT 
WOULD BE THE SHOT IF HE HAS 
HE DID HAVE THE ANGLE BUT WENT IN 
WITH A BURY DEAD WHITE IT DID NOT 
DO ANYTHING WHEN IT WENT INTO THE 
BUNCH YOU HAVE GOT TO FOLLOW 
THROUGH GET LOTS OF SPIN A LOT OF 
PLAYERS WHEN THEY GO INTO THE PACK 
IT GOES TWICE A LITTLE UNFORTUNATE 
THIS IS THE REASON BILLIARDS NEVER 
BECAME SPECTATOR SPORT 
IF IT 
RUNS OF TO THE BACK CUSHION IS IT 
A CERTAIN RED IN OFF THE OTHER RED 
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO RISK IT IF IF THAT IS TOUCHING BALL HE CAN LEAVE 
THE WHITE IN THE JAWS OF THE GREEN 
POCKET NOT TOUCHING BALLS 
HE BRENDAN IS HAVING TO SET THE 
BALLS UP AGAIN 
THE FALSE STARTS IT IS FRUSTRATING 
WHEN THAT HAPPENS 
I PLAYED IN A 
FRAME ONE TIME WE DID IT TWICE IN 
ONE MINUS ONE FRAME SOMETIMES THE BALL 
GOES IN A POSITION AND NEITHER OF 
THEM WANT TO GIVE WAY SO THERE IS 
NO POINT IN CARRYING ON 
IN TERMS 
OF HOW MUCH IT RESTRICTS THE FLOW 
OF YOUR PLAY YOU SAID IT DOES 
HAPPEN TWO OR THREE TIMES PERHAPS 
IN ONE FRAME WENDY YOU ACTUALLY 
CATCH THE OTHER MAN'S I IS IT A 
CASE OF I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE 
HERE 
SOMEBODY WHO WAS IN THE HERE COMMENTARY BOX WILLIE THORNE IT 
HAPPEN TO YOU AND IT WASN'T VERY 
PLEASANT WAS IT 
ANDY HICKS LAST FRAME OF THE 
EVENING FIFTY FIVE IN FRONT IT CAN ONLY 
HAPPEN TO ME 
I TAKE IT YOU LOST 
THAT FRAME AND LOST THAT MATCH TEN TEN SIX OVERNIGHT BEHIND YES IT IS A 
STRANGE RULE BUT IN THAT SITUATION 
WHEN THE POINTS ARE LEVEL IT IS A 
GOOD IDEA 
IT COULD ONLY HAPPEN TO 
YOU 
ANYWAY TAKE TWO BOTH PLAYERS YOU APPEARED TO BE HITTING THE BALL 
REASONABLY WELL IN THAT FRAME 
IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS YOU WOULD 
HAVE FANCIED HIM KNOCKING THAT IN 
HE WENT ALL OUT FOR THE BLACK BUT 
BINGHAM WILL PLAY THE RED STEVE WAS 
AFTER 
THAT WAS A MISJUDGMENT FROM STEVE 
ON LIKE HIM ON THE SAFETY SHOTS 
NOT LIKE HIM ON THE SAFETY SHOTS 
I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE THE OTHER 
DAY AND THEY WERE SAYING THEY ARE 
NOW BETTING ON WHAT BALL IS 
FAVOURITE WHEN YOU POT THE FIRST 
RED L. THINK THEY MADE BLACK 
FAVOURITE THE BAULK COLOURS AT TWO TO ONE 
I THINK IF IT IS OFF THE BREAK OFF 
SHOT YOU WOULD ALWAYS FAVOUR A 
BAULK COLOUR BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF 
SAFETY SHOT BLACK IS LIKELY TO BE 
THE FAVOURITE BALL NO DOUBT I 
WOULD BACK THE WRONG ONE WHAT EVER 
I DID 
THE ODDS WERE FIVE TO FOUR THE BLACK 
TO BE POTTED OF THE FIRST RED TWO TO ONE 
EACH OF THE BAULK COLOURS NINE ONE 
THE BLUE A VERY AGGRESSIVE 
HE 
FLUKED TO THE RED THAT HAPPENS 
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING THE 
AGGRESSIVE SAFETY WHEN YOU ARE 
PLAYING SOMEBODY NOT IN GREAT FORM 
YOU WOULD RATHER HAVE THE BALLS 
OPEN AND CLOSED AND THAT IS WHAT 
STUART HAS BEEN PLAYING THROUGHOUT 
THE MATCH PLAYING THE THICK SAFETY 
SHOTS BUT HE WAS VERY FORTUNATE 
THERE PERFECT ANGLE ON GREEN HE 
IS NOT GUARANTEED TO GET ON TO IT 
NICELY 
HE DID PLAY THE CANNON AND HE IS 
LUCKY TO BE ON A RED NOT GOOD ON A 
RED BUT HE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED TO 
HAVE MISSED THAT 
IT HAS BEEN CALLED A FOUL HE MUST 
HAVE TOUCHED THE RED AS HE WAS 
PUSHING THE CUE THROUGH 
I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING MOOD BUT HE 
POINTED STUART POINTED HE KNEW HE 
HAD MOVED THE RED 
IT WAS A GOOD POT AND HE WAS 
PERFECT ON THE BLUE BUT HE TRIED 
TO GENERATE TOO MUCH POWER THAT 
WAS AN ATTACKING SAFETY SHOT FROM 
STEVE IT'S NOT BAD BUT THERE IS 
JUST A RED TO THE LEFT OF THE PINK 
THAT WILL GIVE HIM A PATH BACK TO 
BALL A FRACTION MORE OVER BEHIND 
THE YELLOW AND STUART BINGHAM 
WOULD HAVE 
HAD A BIG PROBLEM HE HE HAD ONE GLANCE AT THE POTTING ANGLE 
BUT I DON'T THINK HE CAN AVOID THE 
RED THAT IS THE RED JOHN WAS 
SUGGESTING TO THE RIGHT OF THE PINK 
BUT IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF HE 
TRIED TO HIT THE PINK THE GOOD 
SHOT L. THOUGHT HE HAD GOT INSIDE 
THE BLUE HE CERTAINLY PICKED THE 
TOUGHEST SAFETY 
I THOUGHT THE 
OTHER ONE WAS EASY IT DOES NOT 
LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAS LEFT ANYTHING THAT WAS A VERY CLEVER SHOT NOW 
THE ONE ON THE PINK 
GET 
POTTING ANGLE HE WILL 
TAKE THAT ON BECAUSE IT WAS A SHOT 
TO NOTHING 
CAN HE SEE ENOUGH OF THE ONE ON THE 
PINK SPOT IT IS STILL A 
BALL HE 
WILL BE PLAYING SAFE OFF 
THAT WAS THE PROBLEM HE PLAYED 
THIS WORK WITH RIGHT HAND SIDE BUT 
JUST CAUGHT THE RED AT BIT THICK 
AND CAUGHT THE MIDDLE POCKET A 
NICE EASY STARTER FOR STEVE 
NOT THE GREATEST CASE IN THE WORLD 
THE TOP ONE OF THE THREE REDS TO 
THE RIGHT OF THE BLACK WILL POT 
HE PLAYED WITH TOP SPIN YOU GO FOR 
THE PINK SURPRISES ME THAT HE 
PLAYED IT THAT FAITH AT THAT 
PACE 
I THINK HE WASN'T CONFIDENT PACE ABOUT THE POT AND HE WAS LOOKING 
FOR A WAY DOWN THE TABLE 
THAT WAS A NICE KISS IT LOOKED BIT 
UNTIL IT NESTLED AGAINST THE RED 
POSSIBLY THE PINK WILL GO IN THE 
RIGHT CORNER AS WELL 
HE STARTED IT LIKE THIS IN THE 
FIRST FRAME HE IS IN GOOD POSITION 
DIFFICULT TO SEE HIM WINNING THE 
FRAME AT THIS VISIT 
HE NEEDS THE BLACK ON THE SPOT 
WHICH HE WILL PROBABLY PLAY FOR 
VERY VERY SOON 
THEN HE CAN BRING THE REDS INTO 
PLAY BY PLAYING CANNONS IT IS 
TOUGH OFF THE PINK 
STUART IS LOOKING AT THE ANGLE 
THERE IS LOOSE RED BUT IT ISN'T A 
BAD IDEA TO TRY AND GET ON THE NEXT 
BLACK TOO MUCH INTO THE TWO RED 
TO NUDGE INTO THE TWO REDS 
HE NEEDED TO GET HIGH ON THE BLACK 
TO GO INTO THE REDS BUT HE DIDN'T 
IT IS TOUGH NOW TO GET ON A RED 
GOOD SHOT 
HE HAS PLAYED THIS VERY 
NICELY THE BALLS OF AWKWARD AND 
THE BLACK WASN'T ON ITS SPOT BUT 
HE STILL AT A FORTY NINE POINT LEAD HE 
NEEDS ONE MORE AND ONE MORE RED 
ONE MORE AND ONE MORE RED ONE 
MORE COLOUR 
HE TRIED TO COME OVER FOR THE BLACK 
NOT QUITE HARD ENOUGH HE NEEDS A 
COLOUR AND ONE MORE RED TO CLINCH 
THE FRAME 
WE DIDN'T THINK THE ANGLE WAS THERE 
BUT HE PLAYED WITH RIGHT HAND SIDE 
AND BROUGHT THE RED INTO PLAY 
VERY WELL PLAYED THIS BREAK HAS 
BEEN TOP DRAWER IT WASN'T ON WHEN 
HE STARTED STEVE DAVIS PLAYED A 
POOR SAFETY SHOT IT WAS 
HE 
MISSED JUDGED AND PUT THE RED OVER 
THE HOLE 
THE FRAME IS WELL AND TRULY OVER I 
DON'T KNOW WHY HE PLAYED IT LIKE 
THAT STEVE ISN'T GOING TO PLAY ON 
SO THERE FRAME GOES TO STUART 
BINGHAM 
STUART WAS HIT WITH HIS TIGER 
WOODS TOP THE MATCH BETWEEN 
STEPHEN HENDRY AND MARK ALLEN WAS 
THE BEST SO FAR BE FORCED THE MAN 
HAD BEEN SIX TO THREE IN FRONT BUT HENDRY 
CAME BACK THE ULSTER MAN THIS IS 
STEPHEN HENDRY'S TWENTY THREE TWENTY THIRD 
CONSECUTIVE YEAR AT THE CRUCIBLE A 
WIN CLEARLY MEANT A LOT TO STEPHEN 
HENDRY 
TAKE THAT THAT WAS THE HENDRY TOUGHEST MATCH I HAVE EVER WON FORM 
BEING DOWN HE KEPT POTTING BALLS 
ALL THE TIME ITS IT'S ANNOYING 
AFTER A TIME 
I PLAYED THE BETTER 
SNOOKER SO IT IS APPOINTING 
STEPHEN SHOWED AN EXPERIENCE AND 
PLAYED THE PERFECT LAST FRAME L. 
THINK I HAVE COST MYSELF A TOP SIXTEEN 
PLACE WHICH IS THE MOST 
DISAPPOINTING PINK THING THIS THIS IS WHY WE COME HERE IT IS TORTURE 
SOMETIMES BUT THERE IS NO BETTER 
FEELING WHEN YOU GET OVER THE LINE 
RYAN DAY NOW PLAYS THERE REIGNING 
CHAMPION JOHN HIGGINS ON THURSDAY 
MEANWHILE IT IS ALL TOO WELL IN 
THIS MATCH DID THIS WITH REAL 
UPHILL STRUGGLE AGAINST STUART 
BINGHAM DAVIS 
A NICE FLICK ON THE SAFETY SHOT TO 
BRING THE BLACK INTO PLAY THAT WAS PERFECT 
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT VISIT FOR 
STEVE DAVIS HE HAS TO START 
PICKING BE HIS CHANCES A GOOD 
OPENING RED HIS BIG PROBLEM IS 
SCORING WHEN HE GETS THESE CHANCES 
THAT WIPED ITS FEET AS MY OLD DAD 
USED TO SAY A BIT HARDER AND IT 
WOULDN'T HAVE GONE IN 
AS LONG AS HE IS NOT STRAIGHT HE 
WILL BE O. K. TWO REDS STILL 
AVAILABLE 
HAS HE SEEN ANOTHER PLANT HE 
ALWAYS LOOKS FOR PLANTS TO SAVE HIM 
GOING INTO THE PLAN PACK 
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THE BALLS HE WITH 
HIS NOW WHEN HE'S IN PERFECT 
POSITION THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A 
PLANT SOMEWHERE THE WAY HE PLAYED 
AT I PRESUME HE DIDN'T PLAY HARD 
AND TO COME OUT FOR THE LOOSE RED 
HARD ENOUGH 
I THOUGHT HE WAS PUTTING SIDE ON IT 
BUT THERE WAS NO NEED SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN A PLAIN BALL SHOT 
IT WAS A BAD MISS AND HE CAN'T 
AFFORD MANY MORE HE IS RUNNING OUT 
OF FRAMES 
IT WAS AN EASY ENOUGH POT ON THE 
BLACK BUT HE WAS DOING TOO MUCH 
WITH THE CUE BALL L. DON'T THINK HE 
HAS PERFECT POSITION ON THIS RED 
IF IT WAS A GOOD ANGLE AND SO IT 
AND STEVE WOULD PLAY IT IT HE HAS 
AN ANGLE WHERE HE JUST POTS THE RED 
AND WENT INTO THE CLUSTER HE WILL 
PLAY SAFE 
ONE THING IS FOR CERTAIN THERE IS 
NOTHING WRONG WITH HIS SAFETY GAME 
TO PLAY GOOD SAFETY YOU HAVE TO BE 
CUEING WELL BUT SOMETHING ELSE 
MUST MUST HAPPEN IN YOUR MIND 
WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING POPS HE JUST 
SEEMS TO GET ANXIOUS WHEN HE'S 
HITTING THE BALLS AT THE MOMENT POTS 
THAT'S NOT WORK OUT QUITE RIGHT 
THIS RED IS ON TO THIS CORNER 
POCKET HE'S GOT ONE TO THE LEFT CORNER 
MUCH TOO THICK WORRYING TIMES NOW 
I FEEL FOR STEVE L. L. THOUGHT IF HE 
WAS GOING TO HAVE ANY CHANCE IN 
THIS MATCH HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO 
COME OUT BETTER THAN HE DID THIS 
MORNING WHEN HE LOST THE FIRST 
THREE FRAMES SO FAR IT'S THE SAME 
RESULT 
STEVE IS SITTING THERE TRYING TO 
WHERE A LOT OF THINGS OUT HE HAS 
MISSED A LOT OF BALLS CHANCE FOR 
CHANCE HE COULD BE SEVEN TO THREE IN FRONT 
STUART IS PLAYING NICELY SCORING 
QUITE HEAVILY NOW 
STUART BINGHAM IS IN A POSITION 
WHERE HE CAN GET A SIZEABLE LEAD 
AGAIN HE CAME TO THE TABLE A FEW 
POINTS BEHIND 
HE HAS GOT ONE LOOSE RED BUT HAS A 
NICE ANGLE ON THIS BLUE IF HE CAN 
HIT THE RED AT THE APEX OF THIS 
LITTLE CHAIRMAN TRIANGLE HE WILL 
BE UNLUCKY NOT TO BE ON ONE 
HE'S JUST ABOUT ON THIS RED BUT 
HAMPERED BY THE BLACK IT IS NOT 
THAT EASY TO CONTROL THE CUE BALL 
HE HAS TO BE WARY OF A POSSIBLE IN 
OFF INTO THE RIGHT MIDDLE 
BECAUSE HE WAS SO WARY HE HAS 
UNDERHIT THAT BY A CONSIDERABLE 
MARGIN IF HE CAN GET INTO THE CUE 
BALL LOOK BETWEEN BROWN AND GREEN 
AND COME ROUND THE BACK IT IS ON 
ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHEN PEOPLE IN 
PRACTICE HOW MANY BREAKS PLAYERS 
MAKE IN PRACTICE THERE IS NO WAY 
IN THE WORLD YOU WOULDN'T PLAY THE 
PINK PLAY THE HALF BALL PINK MUCH 
INTO THE FULL REDS THAT ARE 
TOGETHER THAT IS THE RIGHT SHOT 
BUT THE PINK IS LITTLE BIT MORE 
DIFFICULT THAN THE BLUE 
HE SEEMS 
TO BE PLAYING DOWN ON IT BUT LOOK 
AT THE WAY HE WENT INTO THE BUNCH 
HE DID NOT GO IN WITH ANY 
CONVICTION YOU ARE ENTITLED TO BE 
ANXIOUS FIRST ROUND AT THE 
CRUCIBLE IT IS VERY NERVE RACKING 
AND STUART HAS NOT BEEN HERE FOR 
FIVE YEARS HE DID GET A BAD 
CONTACT BUT HAS BEEN A GREAT 
PLAYER ALWAYS AMAZES ME I HAVE 
RATED THIS MAN HIGHLY FOR A LONG 
TIME HE NEVER GOT TO THE HEIGHTS I 
EXPECTED I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE IN 
THE TOP SIXTEEN REGULARLY HE HAS GIVEN 
STEVE PLENTY OF CHANCES STEVE STEVE PLAYED THE CROSS DOUBLE IT WAS 
ONLY A FRACTION OUT WELL BECAUSE 
HE PLAYED A POSITIVE SHOT HE HAS 
LEFT THIS LONG RED ON FOR STUART THAT COULD BE THE FRAME WINNER 
HE OBVIOUSLY PLAY THE CANNON 
BECAUSE HE FELT HE COULD NOT GET ON 
TO ONE OF THE REDS THE PINK WENT 
BACK ON TO ITS OWN SPOT A SUPPOSE 
THE BOTTOM ONE OF THE FOUR WOULD 
HAVE POTTED NOW THERE IS ONLY THE 
SAFETY TO PLAY THIS IS HIS THIRD 
CHANCE AND THIS FRAME IS STILL 
ALIVE 
THE THING THAT IMPRESSED ME MORE IN 
THE FIRST SESSION WAS STUART 
BINGHAM'S SAFETY PLAY HE MATCHED 
STEVE SHOT FOR SHOT WHICH I 
THOUGHT MAY HAVE BEEN STEVE'S CASE 
IF YOU LIKE THE TACTICAL SIDE 
IT JUST WRIGGLED IN AND ANOTHER 
CHANCE CAN'T SEE HIM MISSING THIS ONE 
TWENTY N. T. S. IN FRONT JUST TO BE 
ABSOLUTELY SURE OR THREE REDS 
WOULD BE NICE IF HE CAN GET A 
BLACK OFF THE NEXT RED THAT WOULD 
BE GOOD STUART BINGHAM IS LOOKING 
AT THE BALL HE HAD KICK THAT ONE 
UP HERE ON THE REFEREE JUST GIVING 
IT LITTLE WHITE READY FOR THE START OF THE NEXT FRAME A SWIPE 
HE HAS MADE THIS RED ALONG THE TOP 
CUSHION THE ONE HE PLAYED FOR AS 
HARD AS HE COULD TURNING IT DOWN 
BECAUSE HE IS SLIGHTLY HAMPERED BY 
BLACK THE RED AND BLACK WOULD HAVE 
BEEN SUFFICIENT TO MEET STEVE 
NEEDING A SNOOKER THAT WAS A POOR 
POSITIONAL SHOT OFF THE BLACK THAT 
IS FOUR GOOD CHANCES HE HAS HAD TO 
CLINCH THIS FRAME SOMETIMES YOU 
DON'T DESERVE ANOTHER ONE BUT IT 
IS UP TO STEVE TO START PUTTING 
SOME BALLS 
VERY TOUGH TO GET ON THE BLACK I 
WOULDN'T BLAME HIM TRYING TO GET ON 
THE BLACK HERE TRYING TO SWING IT 
AROUND THREE CUSHIONS THE BLACK IS 
ENOUGH 
YOU WOULDN'T GET ME PLAYING FOR THE 
BLACK L. THINK ANY COLOUR AND THEN 
YOU ARE ONLY LOOKING FOR ONE MUCH 
PARTICULARLY WITH THE YELLOW GOING 
AGAINST THE SIDE CUSHION L. WOULD 
PLAY FOR THE BLUE PERSONALLY WELL 
I WOULD HAVE FANCIED HIM PASSING 
THE RED DEAR ME POTTING THE RED 
I THINK HE CAN SEE THE EXTREME 
RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE TWO REDS 
ROLLING UP TO THEM HE PROBABLY 
WON'T FEEL AS THOUGH HE IS GAINING 
IN THE ADVANTAGE THAT IS SUCH AN 
EASY SAFETY SHOT FORCED STEVE TO 
TRY AND GET IN BEHIND THE BLACK 
HE HAS PLAYED IN BEHIND THE PINK 
BUT NOT QUITE GOT RIGHT 
HE HAS NOT PLAYED THAT VERY WELL 
BUT I THINK THE BLUE MAY HAVE COME 
TO HIS RESCUE TAKE IN HE CAN HIT 
THE RED NEAR THE LEFT CORNER BUT 
DIDN'T THINK HE CAN SEE ENOUGH OF 
IT TO POT IT 
HE CAN ONLY SEE THE EXTREME LEFT 
HAND SIDE TO BE HONEST I WOULD 
RATHER TRY AND HIT THAT RED RATHER 
THAN PLAY ONE OF THE CUSHION HE IS 
PLAYING THIS WAY OF 
I HOPE THE REFEREE IS GOOD AT 
JIGSAW AS 
WE HAVE THE OPTION OF LOOKING AT 
THE SCREEN THIS IS A GOOD 
INNOVATION IN SNOOKER BECAUSE IT 
IS EMBARRASSING THE REFEREE WOULD 
KNOW WHAT THE WHITE WALLS BUT HE 
WOULD HAVE TO KNOW WHERE THE BALLS 
ARE CHECKING THE GREEN IS ON ITS 
SPOT THE BLUE IS ON ITS SPOT 
OBVIOUSLY THE RED NEEDS TO BE PUT 
BACK IN ITS POSITION THAT IS WHAT 
THE REFEREE IS LOOKING AT NOW 
THERE IS THE REFEREE DOING THE 
MARKING AND THE REFEREE THERE OUT 
THERE THAT IS WHAT STUART BINGHAM 
THINKS THE RED IS IT WILL TAKE A 
LITTLE WHILE TO DO THIS 
WE ARE GOING TO LEAVE THEM TO THEIR 
JIGSAW PUZZLE BEFORE WE GO A 
CHEQUE ON EVENTS ON TABLE ONE WHEN 
MARK WILLIAMS IS TAKING ON MARK 
DAVIS FROM SUSSEX WILLIAMS IS TWO TO ZERO 
IN FRONT THESE MATCHES CONTINUE ON 
INTERACTIVE RIGHT NOW AND FOR THE 
REST OF THE EVENING IF YOU HAVE 
OTHER PLANS I WILL BE BACK TO SEE 
HOW THINGS GO AROUND THE WITCHING 
HOUR AROUND MIDNIGHT
