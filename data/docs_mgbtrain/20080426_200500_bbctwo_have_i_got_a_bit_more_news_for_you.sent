FIFTY BILLION OF YOUR MONEY 
GIVEN TO A LOAD OF BANKERS UNBELIEVABLE 
A LOAD OF WHAT 
BANKERS OH SORRY 
JUST CHECKING 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT ALL THE MONEY THAT'S GOING TO THE BANKS IS THAT IT DOES MAKE THOSE ADS 
WHERE BANK MANAGERS DANCE AROUND LOOK TWICE AS MUCH LIKE ARSEHOLES AS THEY ALREADY ARE 
THERE IS A SENSE WHEN YOU WATCH THOSE ADS YOU CAN GO 
GET OFF THE SURF BOARD AND GET BACK BEHIND THE COUNTER THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR FRIVOLITY 
BUT IT WAS A GIMMICK ANYWAY HE HAD A BUDGET IN WHICH HE SAID 
I'LL CUT THE BASIC RATE OF TAX 
AND I'LL DO THIS BY ABOLISHING THE TEN P. RATE 
AND THIS CON TRICK LASTED ABOUT FIVE MINUTES 
THEN EVERYONE SAID BUT THAT WON'T WORK WILL IT 
AND BECAUSE GORDON IS SUPPOSED TO BE SUCH A GENIUS WITH FIGURES

WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A BIT MORE 
YES THE ART CRITICS HAVE ALL SAID THAT 
THE CRITICS HAVE SAID HIS HEAD'S TOO BIG 
WHICH ONE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AN ART CRITIC TO HAVE SPOTTED 
WHAT PROMINENT FIGURE HAS REVEALED HIS OWN LONG STANDING HEALTH ISSUES THIS WEEK MUST BE JOHN PRESCOTT 
TALKING ABOUT BEING BULIMIC EVERYONE'S SAYING IT'S VERY BAD TASTE TO BRING UP THE FACT THAT 
THERE'S THIS GENERAL FEEL IN THE MEDIA 
IT'S BRAVE OF JOHN TO REVEAL IT NOW JUST AS HIS MEMOIRS ARE COMING OUT AND THEY'RE JOLLY BORING 
THE ONLY THING WE WANT TO READ ABOUT IS THE AFFAIR WITH THE SECRETARY WHICH HE'S NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT 
SO HE'S GOING TO DISTRACT OUR ATTENTION BY TALKING ABOUT STUFFING SOMETHING ELSE SO 
HE COULD HAVE MENTIONED IT WHILE HE WAS IN OFFICE IT COULD'VE HELPED 
AT LEAST HE COULD SAY I HAD TO GET A SECOND JAG I'D THROWN UP IN THE FIRST 
HE SAID OH ISN'T IT GOOD OF PAULINE TO STAND BY ME 
MY WIFE GOT ME THROUGH IT DID SHE YOU SHOWED YOUR GRATITUDE THEN 
I DON'T WANT TO COME OVER AS CALLOUS 
TOO LATE DO EDITH PIAF INSTEAD 
NON J. E. N. E. REGRETTE RIEN 
WHAT IS THE OTHER CRISIS THE GOVERNMENT ARE TRYING TO AVERT 
THE B. B. C.'S WORRIED ABOUT BALANCE BECAUSE THE MAYORAL ELECTION'S COMING UP VOTE BORIS UM 
I'M SURE YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMIND HIM HE WILL 
HE MIGHT FORGET 
YOU'VE GOT TO REMIND HIM WHO TO VOTE FOR THOUGH 
YOU NOW HAVE TO DO A LIST OF THE TWELVE OTHER CANDIDATES 
YOU COULD VOTE FOR KEN OR BRIAN PADDICK OR ONE OF THE OTHERS 
HAVE YOU SEEN THE LATEST DEBATE BETWEEN THE CANDIDATES ON YOUTUBE 
I HOPE IT'S BALANCED 
HE'S HAD IT HE WANTS IT AND SO DOES HE 
TONIGHT THE THREE LEADING CONTENDERS TO BE MAYOR OF LONDON 
BATTLE IT OUT IN LIVE DEBATE 
I'M HAPPY TO SAY I'VE RUN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVELY A PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANISATION 
UNLIKE EITHER OF THE GENTLEMEN ON MY RIGHT 
I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO'S HAD ANY EXPERIENCE OF HOLDING DOWN COSTS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
YOU BOASTED ON THE TODAY PROGRAMME THAT YOU USED TO MANAGE TWENTY PEOPLE 
IT WAS A FEW MORE THAN THAT 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN AT LEAST FIFTY PEOPLE YES BUT 
I'M PROUD TO SAY WE INCREASED OUR CIRCULATION AND OUR PROFITS 
I'M NOT SURPRISED GIVEN THE STORIES 
NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD HAS THERE BEEN A FIVE PER CENT SHIFT FROM CARS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
WE'RE CARRYING FIFTY PER CENT MORE PEOPLE ON BUSES 
THAT WAS GREAT NOT SURE ABOUT THE CASTING THOUGH 
THIS IS THE LABOUR REBELLION OVER GORDON BROWN'S DECISION TO REMOVE THE TEN P. TAX RATE 
THERE WERE SIGNS BROWN COULD BE ABOUT TO CRACK AS HE SAID 
AH THE OLD BACK SACK AND CRACK TREATMENT 
THE DAILY EXPRESS WARNED ITS READERS THAT THEIR WHAT'S THIS WITH ADVERTISING THE EXPRESS 
IT'S NOT FUNNY OR CLEVER NO IT'S THE DAILY EXPRESS 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY MARKS YET NO I KNOW YOU'VE GOT TWO 
CAN I POINT OUT WE HAVEN'T HAD A QUESTION YET 
WELL 
THE DAILY EXPRESS WARNED ITS READERS THAT THEIR SHOPPING BILLS COULD BE GOING UP BY FIFTEEN A WEEK 
THOUGH THERE'S ONE EASY WAY TO SAVE FORTY P. A DAY 
PAUL AND ANDREW TAKE A LOOK AT THIS O. K. 
SENATOR OBAMA YES SHOWING HE'S ONE OF THE PEOPLE AND 
HERE'S HILLARY OF COURSE PRETENDING SHE DRINKS BEER 
OH I'M GOING TO ASK SOMEBODY SOMETHING ELSE OVER HERE 
AND OH NO THERE SHE IS PRETENDING TO DRINK SOMETHING ELSE 
JOHN MCCAIN WHO WAS HYPNOTISED BY THE VIETNAMESE 
AND WHEN HE BECOMES PRESIDENT LIKE THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE HE'LL KILL SOMEBODY IMPORTANT 
HOW DO YOU KNOW I DON'T I JUST MADE IT UP 
IT'S LIKE A LOT OF STUFF I KNOW 
THAT WAS THE PRIMARY IN PENNSYLVANIA WHERE HILLARY WON BY TEN POINTS 
IT JUST KEEPS THE WHOLE THING GOING ON AND ON 
SENATOR MCCAIN'S THE ONE GRINNING LIKE A GORILLA BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY BEEN CHOSEN EFFECTIVELY 
HE HAS A CHIP ON HIS BRAIN HE JUST WAITS TILL HE GETS THE JOB THEN HE STARTS SHOOTING PEOPLE 
SURELY WHAT THIS IS THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO LOOK DOWN TO EARTH AND OF THE PEOPLE 
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE BOWLING AND DRINKING IN BARS AND ALL THAT 
OBAMA GOT SLAGGED OFF BECAUSE HE SCORED REALLY BADLY 
HE KEPT ROLLING THEM IN THE GUTTER BUT I THINK HIS ADVISORS SAID TO HIM 
THAT THE IMAGE OF A BLACK BALL KNOCKING DOWN THOSE WHITE PINS WASN'T REALLY GOING TO GO DOWN WELL 
HE'S PLAYING SAFE ESPECIALLY COS MOST OF THEM HAVE RED NECKS AS WELL 
WHAT DIRTY TRICKS HAS CLINTON BEEN ACCUSED OF 
UM THIS IS MRS. CLINTON IS IT UM 
IS IT ABOUT THE WEBSITE WHERE IF OBAMA COMES UP THEY PUT A PICTURE OSAMA 
YES 
SO BY SUBTLY CHANGING ONE LETTER THEY SUGGEST HE'S A TOWEL HEAD WHO'S GOING TO KILL THEM 
YES SHE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO LINK 
OBAMA WITH OSAMA IN VOTERS' MINDS AND WITH SOME SUCCESS 
PASTOR ROGER BIRD PENTECOSTAL MINISTER IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
POSTED A SIGN OUTSIDE HIS CHURCH READING 
NO REVEREND THEY'RE NOT 
SHE ALSO MIS SPOKE RECENTLY CAN ANYONE REMEMBER 
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS CONCEPT THAT YOU CAN MIS SPEAK 
WHEN SHE SAID I WENT TO SERBIA AND PEOPLE WERE FIRING AT ME AND I HAD TO DUCK UNDER A HAIL OF BULLETS 
SHE SAID NO I MIS SPOKE 
SO SHE HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE WORDS THAT COME OUT OF HER MOUTH 
SHE CAN TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT NEVER HAPPENED AND BELIEVE IT HAPPENED 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THAT LITTLE CLIP YES 
WE SHOULD PUT GUNFIRE OVER IT 
A VISIT SUPPOSEDLY UNDER FIRE 
A PLUCKY FIRST LADY SETTING FOOT IN THE KILLING FIELDS OF BOSNIA 
I REMEMBER LANDING UNDER SNIPER FIRE THERE WAS NO GREETING CEREMONY 
AND WE BASICALLY WERE TOLD TO RUN TO OUR CARS 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED THANK YOU 
IT'S WHERE POLITICIANS LIE AND YOU THINK 
DID IT NOT OCCUR TO YOU THAT SOMEBODY WOULD LOOK THIS UP 
SHE CLAIMS SHE'S NAMED HILLARY AFTER SIR EDMUND HILLARY THE FIRST WHITE PERSON TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST 
BUT SHE WAS BORN THREE YEARS BEFORE HE CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN 
THAT SHOWS HOW FAR SEEING SHE IS YEAH WE'RE GOING TO NAME YOU AFTER A NEW ZEALAND MOUNTAINEER 
THAT NOBODY'S EVER HEARD OF BUT IN THREE YEARS' TIME YOU'LL BE THE MOST POPULAR KID IN THE PLAYGROUND 
NOW RUN AROUND THE GARDEN WHILE WE TAKE POT SHOTS AT YOU BANG 
HOW DID BILL CLINTON HELP WITH THE DAMAGE LIMITATION EXERCISE THAT FOLLOWED HILLARY'S MIS SPEAKING 
UM HE DIDN'T HAVE SEX WITH SOMEBODY WORKING FOR HIM 
THAT'S MORE MIS POKING ISN'T IT

TIME NOW FOR THE ODD ONE OUT ROUND IAN AND ED YOUR FOUR ARE 
HILLARY CLINTON BEAR GRYLLS 
ELVIS AND TOM KOHNSTAMM 
ELVIS IT TURNS OUT HAD BEEN TO LONDON 
ACCORDING TO A FRIEND OF TOMMY STEELE FACT 
AND HE WAS TOLD NEVER TO MENTION IT 
IT WAS AN OATH OF SILENCE BETWEEN ELVIS AND TOMMY STEELE 
COS IT NEVER HAPPENED HILLARY SAID SHE WAS UNDER SNIPER FIRE BUT WASN'T 
BEAR GRYLLS PRETENDS TO SLEEP OUTDOORS BUT GOES TO A HOTEL 
A CLUE ABOUT THE GUY IN THE CORNER HE'S A TRAVEL WRITER 
HE WROTE THE DEFINITIVE TRAVEL GUIDE OF COLOMBIA BUT HE NEVER WENT THERE 
ELVIS IS THE ODD ONE OUT COS THE OTHERS LIED ABOUT WHERE THEY WERE BUT HE NEVER LIED TOMMY STEELE DID 
ELVIS NEVER WENT TO LONDON TOMMY STEELE MADE IT UP 
THEY HAVE ALL MISLED PEOPLE ABOUT TRIPS ABROAD APART FROM ELVIS 
ALTHOUGH IT EMERGED THIS WEEK THAT HE SECRETLY VISITED ENGLAND IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT 
IT'S ALL MADE UP HOW DO YOU KNOW 
HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD 
HE LANDED BRIEFLY AT A SCOTTISH AIRPORT TO FLY ON TO AMERICA 
IF HE'D TRAVELLED TO LONDON DRIVEN AROUND WITH TOMMY THEN 
GONE BACK TO SCOTLAND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE KNOWN 
TOMMY TOLD THE MAIL 
NO ONE'S TOLD HIM HE'S DEAD 
IF HE'D COME TO LONDON WE'D HAVE KNOWN 
HE COULD HAVE WORN A MOUSTACHE AND A HAT 
THAT WOULD THROW OFF THE WORLD'S PRESS HERCULE POIROT'S IN LONDON 
HERCULE POIROT HELLO I'VE GOT YOUR BOOKS 
THINGS CAN BE DONE IN SECRET 
UNCANNY 
LET'S MOVE ON TO BEAR GRYLLS WHO MISLED VIEWERS ABOUT TRIPS ABROAD 
ON HIS T. V. SERIES BORN SURVIVOR

HE'S NOT EVEN A REAL BEAR 
THEY ALL LIED ABOUT TRIPS ABROAD EXCEPT ELVIS PRESLEY WHO CAME SECRETLY TO ENGLAND 
NO HE DIDN'T 
NO HE DIDN'T HE'S NEVER BEEN TO ENGLAND 
WHY DON'T YOU WANT HIM TO HAVE COME 
I'D HAVE LOVED HIM TO HAVE COME TO LONDON 
PRINCESS DIANA USED TO GO TO THE PICTURES

I'M NOT DENYING OTHER PEOPLE HAVE GONE TO LONDON IT'S A BIG PLACE DOZENS OF PEOPLE WALKING AROUND 
DOZENS OF THEM BUT NOT ELVIS

WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE TOMMY STEELE LIED ABOUT THIS 
HE WENT ROUND LONDON AND MET THE QUEEN 
THE QUEEN SAID TELL ME DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A WOODEN HEART 
I DON'T HAVE A WOODEN HEART BUT MY KIDNEYS MIGHT NOT PASS WATER 
TOMMY STEELE IS CURRENTLY PLAYING DOCTOR DOOLITTLE IN WOKING 
SO NOW IT'S HIS TURN TO DIE IN A TOILET 
BEAR GRYLLS IS IN TROUBLE FOR MISLEADING VIEWERS ABOUT THE DANGERS HE FACED ON HIS T. V. SERIES 
HE CLAIMED TO BE IN A REMOTE FOREST BUT WAS IN A HUNTING LODGE

MILLIONS OF BRITONS WERE FORCED TO HOLD THEIR NOSES LAST WEEK 
AS A HORRIBLE ODOUR PERMEATED THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND THE SMELL WAS TRACED TO GERMAN PIG FARMERS
