I DON'T BELONG ANYWHERE ON THIS PLANET 
COS THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING ELSE 
HASN'T THERE 
BEYOND ALL THIS 
OR WHAT'S THE POINT 
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE 
SOME FORCE OR POWER THAT GUIDES OUR LIVES FROM BIRTH TO DEATH 
PERHAPS SOMEWHERE BEYOND ETERNITY 
AN ULTIMATE UNIMAGINABLY INFINITE INTELLIGENCE 
THAT DEFIES ALL HUMAN COMPREHENSION

I'M JUST GONNA GRAB SOME TAKEAWAY DOWN THE ROAD DID YOU WANT ANYTHING 
OH IS IT MISS MADISON WE'VE NOT YET MET 
I'M ANTHONY NUMBER SIXTY FIVE WE MOVED IN LAST WEEK 
I WAS HOPING I MIGHT RUN INTO YOU OH HELLO 
WE'VE SEEN YOU ON THE TELEVISION MANY TIMES BUT WHEN WE HEARD YOU WERE LIVING NEXT DOOR MY GOSH 
RIGHT 
I MEAN MY WIFE OF COURSE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT BLESS HER ROSALIND WHEN I TOLD HER 
SHE'S UNFORTUNATELY VERY BADLY DISABLED 
SADLY BUT UM 
WE'LL ALWAYS MAKE A POINT OF WATCHING WE'RE NEVER DISAPPOINTED 
IN ACTUAL FACT YOU HAVEN'T GOT TWO MINUTES TO SPARE AT ALL JUST TO POP IN NOW AND SAY HELLO 
IT REALLY WOULD MAKE HER DAY UM NOW 
WE WERE COURSE NO WE'D BE GLAD TO WOULDN'T WE 
SO HOW DID UM OH YES 
A RIDING ACCIDENT TRAGICALLY 
FOUR YEARS AGO BEFORE WE ACTUALLY KNEW EACH OTHER 
HER PARTNER AT THE TIME ONCE HE BECAME AWARE THERE WAS NO HOPE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM REPAIRING 
DECIDED TO MOVE ON 
RATHER DISGRACEFULLY IN MY VIEW BUT 
HIS LOSS WAS MY GAIN 
SO WHEN THE TWO OF US MET UP THROUGH A FRIEND OF A FRIEND 
SHE CAN HEAR YOU PERFECTLY OF COURSE 
AND HER EYES ARE OFTEN MORE EXPRESSIVE THAN WORDS CAN EVER BE 
YOU'D BE AMAZED THE COMPLEX THOUGHTS SHE IS CAPABLE OF CONVEYING ISN'T THAT RIGHT 
ONCE YOU'VE LEARNT THE LANGUAGE 
I WAS UNDER NO ILLUSION WHEN WE GOT MARRIED WHAT IT WOULD INVOLVE YOU KNOW EVERY MORNING 
WASHING HER ALL OVER AND GROOMING HER FROM HEAD TO TOE 
MAKING SURE SHE ALWAYS LOOKS HER BEST 
KNOWING HOW TERRIBLY IMPORTANT THAT IS TO HER 
EVERY NIGHT UNDRESSING HER 
GENTLY MASSAGING THE TISSUES TO PREVENT ATROPHY AND GETTING HER TO BED 
IT'S THE SORT OF THING YOU QUITE HAPPILY DO 
AND MORE BESIDES 
WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEONE 
HOW CAN YOU SAY IT'S TOUCHING IT'S SICK TOUCHING HER UP MORE LIKE 
GOD THAT WAS SO BIZARRE 
WELL I SUPPOSE YOU SAY THAT BUT 
I MEAN FOR GOODNESS' SAKE USE YOUR EYES ALICE 
HE'S OBVIOUSLY HAVING A RARE OLD TIME 
WITH HIS OWN PERSONAL BLOW UP PLAYBOY DOLL 
WHAT GOES THROUGH HER POOR HEAD I SHUDDER TO THINK WITH HIM MAULING HER BODY MORNING NOON AND NIGHT 
YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S BEING A BIT CYNICAL 
I MEAN I KNOW THAT'S LIKE THE OBVIOUS KNEE JERK CONCLUSION TO JUMP TO BUT 
AND OF COURSE YOU MAY BE RIGHT 
OR THEY MAY CARE VERY DEEPLY ABOUT EACH OTHER 
PEOPLE SURPRISE YOU IN LIFE ALL THE TIME 
IS IT REALLY FOR US DO YOU THINK TO SIT HERE AND JUDGE THEM 
YEAH WELL THANKS TO HIM I'VE GOT COLD CHOW MEIN AND DRY NOODLES 
SO I DON'T THINK HE'S GETTING A CHRISTMAS CARD THIS YEAR 
SO YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE AT ALL THAT SHE MIGHT 
WHY WOULD SHE ALICE YOU KNOW 
IT'S LIKE I HAD SOMETHING SO GOOD THERE AND SOLID AND I JUST FLUSHED IT ALL AWAY STRAIGHT DOWN THE CAN 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU LEARN THOSE LESSONS TOO LATE IN LIFE 
I MEAN THAT'S THE REAL TRAGEDY 
AND SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING 
YOU AND DOUGLAS I'M AFRAID 
THE SILENCE HAS BEEN DEAFENING 
THAT'S A SHAME I MEAN COS HE WAS ALWAYS 
NO I MEAN NO THAT'S A SHAME 
SO SNAP 
YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING REALLY REALLY APPALLING 
THE OTHER DAY WHEN YOU CALLED I WAS 
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO HANG MYSELF 
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS 
I MEAN WHETHER I EVER WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW HAD THE STOMACH TO 
BUT IT WAS JUST LIKE AFTER ALL THAT 
AND JANEY WALKING OUT ON ME WHAT WAS MY LIFE WORTH 
I DID 
WHAT NO NOTHING NO 
YOU WERE THINKING SOMETHING WHAT 
NO WELL 
THE WAY THINGS TURN OUT YOU JUST WONDER SOMETIMES 
ARE WE READY TO ORDER NOW 
OH YES RIGHT 
LET'S ORDER 
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING FOLKS 
OH GOD I DO 
NOW IS THAT NOT A LITTLE BIT STRANGE OR WHAT 
GIVES A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO THE WORD STAR FU 
NO I BETTER NOT MAKE THAT JOKE HAD I 
BUT IT IS AMAZING THOUGH WHEN YOU ACTUALLY STOP TO THINK ABOUT IT 
WHEN YOU STOP TO THINK ABOUT WHAT 
WELL YOU KNOW THAT ALL THIS IS ACTUALLY OUT THERE AND HE'S MANAGED TO FIND IT 
COS I MEAN YOU LOOK BACK AT THE ANCIENT GREEKS AND EVERYONE 
ALL THEY COULD SEE WAS A LOAD OF PLOUGHS AND BEARS 
THINK I MIGHT JUST GO AND WASH MY HANDS YOU COMING 
WHAT'S THIS ALL ON YOUR OWN 
WELL I SUPPOSE IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING YOU COULD SAY THAT BUT 
WHAT'S NEW YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT MY LOVE LIFE 
OH DEAR REALLY NO LISTEN 
I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT 
THAT KIND OF PAIN 
IT'S NOT NICE 
SOUNDS AS IF YOU'VE BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END MORE THAN ONCE 
ONCE IS ENOUGH I'LL TELL YOU NOW 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK 
IF YOU'RE EVER GONNA MEET THAT ONE PERSON IN YOUR LIFETIME THIS IS IT 
AND YOU JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THINGS COULD EVER BE THAT PERFECT 
AND THAT'S HOW IT WAS 
THE TWO OF US ME AND JENNY 
AND THEN IT WAS LIKE YOUR WORST EVER NIGHTMARE YOU KNOW 
SHE DIED IN HER SLEEP 
OH DON'T NO 
I WOKE UP IN THE BED AND LOOKED ACROSS 
SHE WAS JUST LYING THERE 
EYES WIDE OPEN BUT SHE WASN'T BREATHING 
THEY RECKON HER HEART HAD JUST STOPPED 
IN THE NIGHT NO SIGNS OR WARNING OF ANY TROUBLE 
SHE'D NEVER SMOKED OR 
OH THAT IS JUST 
COS HOW DO YOU EVER GET OVER A THING LIKE THAT 
YOU JUST HAVE TO DON'T YOU 
SOMEHOW BUT 
AND SO WHEN DID ALL THIS HAPPEN 
I SUPPOSE IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT 
HALF PAST SIX THIS MORNING 
COS SEVEN O'CLOCK YOU KNOW SHE'D ALWAYS BE UP AND ABOUT AND READY FOR WORK 
THIS MORNING YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS THIS HAPPENED TO YOU TODAY 
AND YOU'RE HERE 
YES I'M HERE

GLAD TO PUT IT BEHIND YOU I EXPECT 
I KNOW I DO WONDER SOMETIMES LLOYD 
WHAT KIND OF CRUEL JOKE IS BEING PLAYED ON ME BY SOMEONE UP THERE 
FOR THEIR OWN PRIVATE AMUSEMENT AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING TERMINALLY PARANOID 
NO I THINK I KNOW JUST WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT 
JUST GIVE ME TWO SECONDS WHILE I OPEN SOME WINE 
SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN A WASH OUT 
HOW COULD IT BE A WASH OUT 
YOU'D GOT HER ALL STOKED UP WITH A CANDLELIT MEAL AND MUSIC INCENSE ON THE GO 
IT'S A NO BRAINER 
I DUNNO COS I WAS PLAYING IT BY YOUR RULES WASN'T I 
YOU KNOW THAT THING YOU TOLD ME 
WHEN A GIRL SAYS NO SHE NEARLY ALWAYS MEANS YES 
SO WHEN I ASKED HER IF SHE'D OBJECT TO ME PUTTING MY HAND DOWN HER JEANS 
AND DON'T TELL ME SHE SAID NO 
SO YOU KNOW I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANY FURTHER RIGHT O. K. NICE ONE KENNY 
SOUNDS LIKE YOU REALLY NAILED IT 
I'M NOT SO SURE AND I TELL YOU I'M NOT SURE 
IF ALL YOUR FEMALE PSYCHOLOGY IS WHAT IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW 
O. K. THEN CHIEF THAT'S US OUT OF YOUR HAIR FOR NOW 
SAME TIME TOMORROW YEAH O. K. SEE YOU GUYS AND THANKS VERY MUCH 
OH GOD 
WHAT NO THAT WAS LIKE SOME STRANGE OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE 
AS IF I WAS BACK ON THE COUNTER THERE FOR A MINUTE IT WAS JUST 
NO ANYWAY CHEERS 
CHEERS AND PLEASE SIT DOWN 
WE CAN GO OUT FOR A BIT OF PASTA OR SOMETHING IN A WHILE 
AND WELL FROM THE FIRST MINUTE I MET YOU ALMOST 
I'VE JUST HAD THIS FEELING AND I CAN'T GET IT OUT OF MY MIND 
EVERY TIME WE MEET 
JUST WATCHING YOU AND LISTENING TO YOU THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU THE WAY YOU DEAL WITH THEM 
I'M A BIT OF A CASE STUDY 
WELL I SUPPOSE IN A WAY BUT IN THE NICEST WAY 
AND WHAT I'M GONNA SAY TO YOU IS PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU'LL WANT TO HEAR BUT 
WHEN YOU THINK WE'RE ONLY HERE TOGETHER NOW BECAUSE OF HIM 
AND KNOWING YOU NOW AND KNOWING GIL AS I DID 
I REALLY BELIEVE SOMEHOW IT WOULD HAVE WORKED OUT THE TWO OF YOU 
IT PLAYS ON MY MIND 
ALL THE TIME 
I MEAN WE ONLY SPOKE TO EACH OTHER A FEW TIMES I MEAN FOR HOURS ON END 
IT'S LIKE NEITHER OF US WANTED TO PUT THE PHONE DOWN BUT 
AND OBVIOUSLY 
I'LL NEVER KNOW NOW WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH HIS MIND 
I JUST KNOW THERE WAS SO MUCH THERE I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SHARE 
NOW I NEVER WILL 
I MEAN THE SHOCK OF THAT HAPPENING JUST FROM NOWHERE THAT DAY 
HE WAS BEING TREATED OF COURSE FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE BUT 
AND HOW MUCH NOTICE DO YOU EVER TAKE OF THAT 
YOU KNOW AND THE HEARTBREAKING TRUTH THAT YOU CAN NEVER BRING THEM BACK 
BUT WHAT YOU CAN BRING BACK MAYBE IS THAT PART OF HIM THAT NEVER WENT AWAY 
VARIOUS BITS AND PIECES WHEN HIS PARENTS WENT THROUGH HIS STUFF THEY PASSED ACROSS TO ME 
SCRIPTS AND IDEAS 
MATERIAL HE'D BEEN WORKING ON JUST IN CASE YOU KNOW WHATEVER BUT 
IN AMONG THE C. D.S. 
I DON'T THINK THEY REALISED 
HIS DIARY 
YOU SAY YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH HIS MIND AND WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU 
I MEAN HE WAS A WRITER YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF HIS THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS 
I HAD NO IDEA 
EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS 
GOD IT MUST BE SO FULL OF 
I MEAN HIS FAMILY OBVIOUSLY SHOULD HAVE THIS 
AND OF COURSE THEY WILL IT'S JUST 
I JUST KNOW ALICE AS MUCH AS I KNOW ANYTHING IN THIS LIFE 
IF ALL THIS WAS WRITTEN FOR SOMEONE ONE DAY TO READ 
IT WAS WRITTEN FOR YOU 
SEE YOU TOMORROW 
HI 
HELLO JUST STARTING ANOTHER SHIFT 
OH YEAH HI HOW ARE YOU 
OH I'M ALL RIGHT 
UM LISTEN 
ON THE OFF CHANCE I MIGHT SEE YOU 
I DIDN'T KNOW IF THIS MIGHT BE OF ANY USE AT ALL 
ONLY IT JUST I HAVE TO SAY HELPED ME SO MUCH THROUGH BOTH MY PARENTS 
AND I JUST THOUGHT 
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY NOTHING CHANGES ANYTHING 
IT CAN'T THAT TERRIBLE AWFUL SENSE OF LOSS IT'S LIKE 
HOW CAN ANYTHING BE RIGHT EVER AGAIN 
BUT WHEN IT'S SOMEONE SO CLOSE 
I REALLY DO UNDERSTAND ACTUALLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE 
OH DEAR I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY 
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO MEET NO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY BECAUSE THIS IS 
GOD I MEAN 
SO SWEET AND THOUGHTFUL AND CONSIDERATE OF YOU 
AND THE THING IS 
I MADE IT ALL UP 
W. H. SORRY WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
MY GIRLFRIEND JENNY THE WHOLE THING ABOUT HER DYING IN MY BED 
SHE'S ACTUALLY IN SCARBOROUGH AT THE MOMENT DOING AN ALAN AYCKBOURN 
IT'S JUST LAST FRIDAY NIGHT OUR DRAMA TUTOR GAVE US 
THIS IMPROV EXERCISE WE ALL HAD TO WORK ON OVER THE WEEKEND 
IT'S LIKE WE HAD TO COME UP WITH THIS REALLY DRAMATIC EMOTIONALLY INTENSE BACK STORY OF SOME KIND 
AND THEN PRESENT IT AS IF IT HAD ACTUALLY HAPPENED 
TO SOME FRIENDS OR SOMEONE WE'D JUST MET OR WHATEVER 
AND OBVIOUSLY THE TEST WOULD BE WHETHER THEY BELIEVED IT 
OH RIGHT 
SO IT WAS JUST RIGHT 
WELL THAT WAS YES VERY GOOD 
ANYWAY 
BLESS YOU BETTER GET ON THEN 
SORRY ABOUT THAT 
YES 
BYE 
SO YET AGAIN I'M LEFT THERE 
LIKE A BEACHED WHALE EXPOSED AND OUT OF MY DEPTH 
EMOTIONALLY STRANDED WITH NOWHERE TO GO 
IT'S LIKE HOW CAN YOU EVER TELL WHEN SOMEONE REALLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT 
AND FEELS WHAT YOU'RE FEELING BECAUSE 
THESE THINGS GO BEYOND WORDS DON'T THEY 
BEYOND ANYTHING WE CAN DO OR SAY OR EVEN DESCRIBE 
WHAT IT IS THAT DRAWS TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT 
YOU JUST KNOW FINALLY THE SEARCH IS OVER 
I MEAN COS UNTIL THAT POINT IT'S ALL JUST COMPLETE AND UTTER MADNESS OF COURSE 
LIKE EVEN WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE FOUND THE PERFECT FORMULA 
AND EVERYTHING FITS LIKE A GLOVE 
THE LAWS OF LOGIC COME CRASHING DOWN AROUND YOU EVERY TIME 
AND I DON'T KNOW ROSALIND 
HOW DOES IT WORK WITH SOMEONE YOU'VE NEVER EVEN MET 
I MEAN JUST BECAUSE ONE HEART'S STOPPED BEATING 
MAYBE IF YOU CAN SOMEHOW RECLAIM THEIR PAST 
THROUGH YOUR PRESENT 
FOR A FEW MINUTES 
ONE DAY AT A TIME 
AND EVEN THOUGH LIFE GOES ON COS IT HAS TO BUT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK SERIOUSLY 
IS THAT SO DUMB AND WET AND WRONG FOR ANY OF US 
TO TRY AND FIND ONE SMALL CORNER OF THIS WORLD 
WHERE WE'LL NEVER FEEL ALONE 
THAT'S MY HOME BY LOUIS ARMSTRONG 
WHEN THE SUN SETS IN THE SKY 
AND FLOWERS NEVER DIE BABE 
FRIENDS DON'T PASS YOU BY 
FOR THAT'S MY HOME 
WHEN THE FOLKS SAY HOW D'YOU DO 
LIKE THEY MEAN IT TOO 
WHERE MAMMA'S LOVE IS TRUE THAT'S MY HOME 
I'M ALWAYS WELCOMED BY NO MATTER WHERE I ROAM 
JUST A LITTLE SHACK TO ME IS HOME SWEET HOME 
WHERE THE SWANEE RIVER FLOWS 
THE SHADED PINE TREE GROWS 
I NEEDN'T FRET NO MORE COS THAT'S MY HOME
