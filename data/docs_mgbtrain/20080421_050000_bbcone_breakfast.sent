GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO THE 
PROGRAMME IT IS MONDAY TWENTY FIRST APRIL 
ALSO AHEAD TODAY THOUSANDS DIE 
FROM BLOOD CLOTS EVERY YEAR NOW A 
NEW DRUG COULD REDUCE THE RISK FROM 
HOSPITAL OPERATIONS THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND GIVES A FIFTY BILLION 
LIFELINE TO THE HIGH STREET BANKS 
THE DETAILS ARE CONFIRMED LATER 
THIS MORNING AROUND A THIRD OF THE 
THINGS WE EAT AT SOME POINT WILL 
HAVE BEEN POLLINATED BY A HONEY BEE 
BUT NOW THERE IS A WARNING THAT 
THEY COULD ALL BE GONE IN TEN YEARS 
AND WHAT NEXT FOR JOE CALZAGHE 
IN WEATHER A LITTLE RAIN IN THE 
SOUTH BUT FOR MOST OF US A DRY DAY 
AND IT'S STARTING TO FEEL MILDER 
SHE IS THE BEST FRIEND ANYONE COULD 
HOPE FOR AND IT IS AS MUCH SMITHY 
AS I AM AND I SHARE THIS WITH HER 
THE CULT COMEDY GAVIN AND STACY 
TRIUMPHS AT THE T. V. BAFTISE THE MAIN 
NEWS THIS MORNING BAFTAS 
A MULTI MILLION POUND NEXT WORK OF 
CENTRES WERE SET UP WHERE ALL NEW 
APPLICANTS FOR PASSPORTS WOULD HAVE 
TO ATTEND A FACE TO FACE INTERVIEW 
AND LAST YEAR NINETY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS 
WERE ASKED FOR AND NOT A SINGLE ONE 
HAS BEEN TURNED DOWN THE PASSPORT 
CENTRE SAYS IT IS A SUCCESS BUT 
CRITICS SAY IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY 
KEITH IS AT THE CENTRE 
LAST YEAR THEY BELIEVE THEY ISSUED 
AROUND TEN THOUSAND PASSPORTS BASED ON 
FRAUDULENT APPLICATIONS SO THEY 
BELIEVE THAT FACE TO FACE 
INTERVIEWS WOULD HELP WITH THIS 
PROBLEM SO THEY HAVE SET UP A 
NETWORK OF CENTRES FOR PEOPLE TO 
PROVE WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE FALSE 
IDENTITIES HAVE BEEN AL TERRORIST 
WEAPON LAST YEAR INJURY YAD 
BALLOT WAS JAILED FOR LIFE AS HE 
HAD SEVERAL FRAUDULENT PASSPORTS 
IT IS BELIEVED TEN THOUSAND FRAUDULENT 
PASSPORTS WERE ISSUED LAST YEAR AND 
HALF CAME FROM NEW APPLICANTS CAN CAN YOU CONFIRM YOUR NAME PLEASE YES YES IT'S LES SMITH 
LAST YEAR THE 
CENTRES SAID THEY WOULD INTERVIEW 
EVERY APPLICANT APPLYING FOR A NEW 
PASSPORT IN A FAST TO FAST 
INTERVIEW JUST UNDER NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED AND WHILST 
SOME HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED NOT A 
SINGLE ONE HAS BEEN TURNED DOWN 
THE CENTRE SAYS THAT IS NOT A 
FAILURE 
IN TERMS OF FRAUD PREFPBGS FAILURE I'M SATISFIED THAT THE MAIN 
PRISONS I'M SATISFIED THAT THE 
MAIN PARENT DETERRENT WILL BE 
PREVENTION PREVENTION THE COST OF A PASSPORT HAS RISEN 
SHARPLY JUST THREE YEARS AGO THEY 
COST FORTY TWO NOW IT IS SEVENTY TWO ONE TWO SEVEN FIVE OH OF 
THAT FEE GOES TOWARDS PAYING FOR 
THE NEW INTERVIEW SERVICE AND EVERY 
APPLICANT PAYS IT WHETHER YOU 
ATTEND AN INTERVIEW OR NOT AND 
CRITICS SAY THAT IS A WASTE OF 
MONEY 
EVERY HARDENED CRIMINAL AND MONEY ORGANISED GANG AND TERRORIST ARE 
NOT GOING THIS ROUTE TO GET THEIR 
FAKE BRITISH PASSPORT THEY WILL 
USE OTHER ROUTES THIS IS NOT ONLY 
INCONVENIENCING THE BRITISH 
CITIZEN BUT IT IS COSTING THEM 
BECAUSE A HEFTY CHUNK IS GOING TO 
THESE CENTRES 
SECURE EXPERTS SAY 
THE CENTRES WILL BRING BENEFITS 
BUT THE TERRORISTS WILL FIND WAYS 
OF GETTING AROUND IT 
THE CRIMINALS 
AND TERRORIST WILL FIND WAYS OF 
GETTING IN THERE TO GET THE 
PASSPORTS THEY WANT AND MOST 
FRAUDULENT PASSPORTS ARE ON THE 
MARKET FOR FIVE HUNDRED 
THE IDENTITY AND PASSPORT SERVICE 
SAYS BY THE END OF THE YEAR EVERY 
NEW APPLICANT WILL FACE AN 
INTERVIEW BUT IT WILL BE SOME TIME 
BEFORE WE KNOW IF THIS EXPENSIVE 
SYSTEM HAS HAD AN IMPACT THERE HAS 
BEEN A ROLLING START TO THIS 
SERVICE JUST ONE IN FIVE ADULTS 
HAVE HAD TO GO FOR AN INTERVIEW SO 
FAR BUT THEY ARE SAYING THAT BY 
THE END OF THE SUMMER EVERY SINGLE 
NEW APPLICANT WILL HAVE TO ATTEND A 
TWENTY MINUTE INTERVIEW AT ONE OF THE 
NETWORK CENTRES ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
THE IDENTITY AND PASSPORT SERVICE 
SAYS THAT BY MAKING THE APPLICATION 
SYSTEM MORE ROBUST THEY KNOW THAT 
THE CRIMINAL SECTION WILL GO 
ELSEWHERE FOR PASSPORT BUT THEY 
ARE HOPING TO BLOCK OFF ONE ROUTE 
AND LATER IN THE PROGRAMME WE'LL BE 
INTERVIEWING THE HEAD OF THE 
IDENTITY AND PASSPORT 
SERVICE A NEW DRUG COULD 
SAVE MANY PATIENTS' LIVES EVERY 
YEAR SHARON FRANKLIN HAS HAD TWO 
HIP REPLACEMENT OPERATIONS AFTER 
THE FIRST ONE SHE DEVELOPED BLOOD 
CLOT IN VAIN IT IS VERY PAINFUL 
AND POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS SO 
BEFORE THE SECOND OPERATION SHARON 
HAD WEEKS OF BLOOD THINNING 
INJECTIONS 
TO PREVENT ANOTHER INJECTIONS BLOOD CLOT FOR MY SECOND HIP 
OPERATION THEY GAVE ME A COURSE OF 
HEPARIN INJECTIONS FOR SIX WEEKS 
THAT WAS LIKE HAVING A BEE STING 
DAILY THE PAIN WAS IMMENSE BLOOD BLOOD CLOTS IN HOSPITAL PATIENTS ARE A 
SERIOUS PROBLEM THEY ARE THOUGHT 
TO CAUSE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DEATHS IN ENGLAND 
EACH YEAR IT COSTS AROUND SIX HUNDRED FORTY 
MILLION A YEAR TO MANAGE THE HEALTH 
EFFECTS FIFTY PER CENT OF PATIENTS IN HIP 
REPLACEMENT OPERATIONS ARE AT RISK 
BUT THAT RISK CAN BE CUT 
DRAMATICALLY WITH BLOOD THINNING 
DRUGS BEFORE SURGERY 
UNTIL NOW PATIENTS HAVE HAD 
INJECTIONS WITH CONSTANT MONITORING 
BEFORE THEIR OPERATION IT IS HOPED 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PILL WILL GIVE 
DOCTORS ANOTHER OPTION 
A TABLET IS 
VERY MUCH EASIER TO GIVE IT IS 
MUCH BETTER FOR THE NURSING STAFF 
AS WELL AS THE PATIENTS AS SO WE 
HOPE IT WILL BRING EXCITEMENT AND 
FRESHNESS TO THE AREA AND ENCOURAGE 
PEOPLE TO GIVE BLOOD THINNERS EACH EACH YEAR THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS LIKE 
SHARON HAVE OPERATIONS BETTER 
SCREENING AND PRE SURGERY TREATMENT 
COULD AVOID THE PAIN SHE WENT 
THROUGH FROM A BLOOD CLOT 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND COULD THROW A 
FIFTY BILLION LIFELINE TO BANKS 
STRUGGLING WITH THE IMPACT OF THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH UNDER THE PLAN BANKS 
WILL BE ABLE TO SWAP THEIR 
POTENTIALLY RISKY MORTGAGE DEBTS 
FOR GOVERNMENT BONDS DECLAN IS AT 
THE STOCK EXCHANGE THIS IS ALL 
ABOUT GETTING THE BANKS TO LEND 
MONEY TO EACH OTHER ONCE AGAIN 
SOMETHING THEY DID FREELY BEFORE 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH BUT THEY HAVE 
BEEN RELUCTANT TO DO SINCE THEN IT 
IS THE GUARANTEE TO THE OTHER BANK 
THAT IT IS GOING TO GET ITS MONEY 
BACK AT SOME POINT BUT THE PROBLEM 
WITH THE MORTGAGE DEBT HAS BEEN 
THAT SINCE THE FALL IN THE VALUE OF 
HOMES IN THE U. S. AND SINCE 
HOMEOWNERS IN THE U. S. HAVE STOPPED 
PAYING SOME OF THEIR MONEY BACK IS 
THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH 
THAT DEBT IS WORTH HOW MUCH OF A 
FIRM GUARANTEE IT IS FOR LOANS 
BETWEEN BANKS SO THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND HAS HIT UPON A PLAN THAT 
WOULD ALLOW THE BANKS INSTEAD OF 
USING MORTGAGE DEBT AS A GUARANTEE 
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SWAP THAT FOR 
GUARANTEED GOVERNMENT BONDS AND USE 
THOSE INVESTMENTS TO SWAP AS 
GUARANTEES BETWEEN EACH OTHER FOR 
LOANS THE ADVANTAGE TO THE BANK IS 
THAT THESE GUARANTEED BONDS ONE A 
FIXED VALUE AND PEOPLE KNOW WHAT 
THEY ARE WORTH BUT THERE IS A 
DANGER TO THE TAXPAYER AND IT IS 
THAT WE END UP OWNING THOSE 
MORTGAGES OF QUESTIONABLE VALUE 
THE CHANCELLOR SAYS STEPS WILL BE 
TAKEN TO PROTECT THE TAXPAYER BUT 
THE CONCERN IS AS VINCENT CABLE 
FROM THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WAS 
SAYING YESTERDAY IS THAT THE BANKS 
HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO PRIVATISE 
THEIR PROFITS BUT NATIONALISE THEIR 
DEBTS M. P.'S RETURN TO WESTMINSTER 
TODAY FOLLOWING THE EASTER BREAK 
WITH THE ROW STILL RAGING OVER 
GORDON BROWN'S DECISION TO END THE 
TEN P. RATE OF INCOME TAX MINISTERS 
ARE HOPING TO FIGHT OFF A REBEL BY 
ABOUT SEVENTY BACKBENCHERS WHO WANT 
COMPENSATION FOR THE FIVE MILLION 
HOUSEHOLDS WHO ARE TO LOSE OUT 
GORDON BROWN BELIEVES HE HAS 
EXPLAINED IT AND EXPLAINED IT AND 
EXPLAINED IT AGAIN AND HE DOESN'T 
UNDERSTAND WHY NO ONE HAS GOT THE 
MESSAGE AS DISGRUNTLED LABOUR M. P.'S 
RETURN TO WESTMINSTER TODAY THEY'LL 
FACE HEAVY PRESSURE TO ACCEPT THAT 
LOW PAID PEOPLE ARE BETTER OFF 
UNDER LABOUR EVEN WITH THE 
SCRAPPING OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE BUT 
TO A SIZEABLE NUMBER OF REBELS 
THAT IS BALONEY 
THE PRIME MINISTER 
HAS BEEN IN DENIAL AND HAS BEEN 
SINCE A YEAR AGO WHEN I MET HIM AND 
SUGGESTED WE SHOULD HAVE A 
PROGRAMME OF COMPENSATION IN PLACE 
FOR THIS APRIL HE DENIED THERE 
WOULD BE ANY LOSERS 
M. P.'S ARE 
BOMBARDING THE TREASURY WITH 
COMPLAINTS BECAUSE IT IS ESTIMATED 
THAT THE NEW RATES COULD HIT FIVE 
MILLION HOUSEHOLDS YOUNG PEOPLE 
WITH NO CHILDREN COULD STAND TO 
LOSE UP TO TWENTY FIVE A YEAR AND FOR 
MANY M. P.'S THAT IS TOO MUCH WITH A 
COMMONS VOTE A WEEK AWAY THERE IS 
TALK OF TRYING TO QUELL A REBELLION

TURNED DOWN AS RESULT OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S STRICT NEW INTERVIEW 
SYSTEM SYSTEM THOUSANDS OF LIVES COULD BE SAVED

GOOD MORNING IF LAST WEEK WAS 
TOUCH TOO CHILLY FOR YOU THIS WEEK 
IT IS SET TO BE MILDER AND IF YOU 
GET SUNSHINE IT COULD FEEL WARMER 
NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF SUNSHINE 
THIS MONDAY MORNING A GREY AND 
MISTY START ACROSS MUCH OF THE U. K. 
IT IS DRY BUT IF I SHOW YOU THE 
RAINFALL PICTURE FROM EARLIER 
THERE HAS BEEN RAIN PUSHING INTO 
TOWARDS SOUTHERN PARTS OF ENGLAND 
SOME OF THAT ON THE HEAVY SIDE HIT 
AND MISS GENERALLY SOUTHERN PARTS 
OF ENGLAND IN THE LONDON AREA IT 
COULD BE WET 
BUT IT IS SOUTH OF THE M. FOUR WHERE THE 
HEAVIEST OF THE RAIN WILL BE 
AND THE RAIN WILL CONTINUE REALLY 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE MORNING JUST 
EASING LITTLE BIT FROM THE SOUTH 
EAST DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE 
DAY NORTH OF THAT IT SHOULD BE 
DRY DRY FAIRLY GREY AND MISTY A BIT OF A 
FROST ACROSS NORTHERN PARTS OF 
SCOTLAND BUT AFTER ALL THAT CLOUD 
TO BEGIN WITH IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
SKIES WILL BRIGHTEN AND 
TEMPERATURES IN BELFAST UP TO TWELVE 
CELSIUS MORE CLOUD ACROSS SCOTLAND 
STILL FAIRLY BRIGHT WITH SUNSHINE 
HOLDING ON TO GREY LOW CLOUD ACROSS 
THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND ACROSS 
EASTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND WE WILL 
SEE THE SUNSHINE COME THROUGH IT 
WILL FEEL CHILLY TOWARDS THE NORTH 
SEA COASTS BUT INLAND TEMPERATURES 
COULD LIFT UP TO FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN CELSIUS 
TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST WE WILL 
HOLD ON TO THE CLOUD SO RAIN 
AROUND AS WELL ACROSS DEVON 
CORNWALL AND SOMERSET 
ALSO ACROSS SOUTHERN PARTS OF WALES 
THE NORTH WALES SHOULD STAY DRY 
THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT THROUGH THIS COMING EVENING WE 
LOSE THE RAIN FROM THE SOUTH WEST 
THAT CLEARS OFF MOST OF US WILL 
HAVE DRY NIGHT IT WILL TURN 
MISTY AND MURKY IN ONE OR TWO SPOTS 
BUT NOT TOO CHILLY TEMPERATURES 
GENERALLY AROUND FIVE TO EIGHT CELSIUS 
INTO TOMORROW MORNING WE WILL 
START OFF WITH CLOUD A BIT OF MIST 
MISTINESS MISTINESS IT WILL BE A DRY DAY WITH 
SUNSHINEMENT MORE CLOUD FOR THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY 
BUT IN THE SUNSHINE IT WILL FEEL 
MILD TEMPERATURES PEAKING AT SEVENTEEN 
CELSIUS 
WE HAVE WORRYING NEWS FOR YOU IF 
YOU ARE EATING TOAST SPREAD WITH 
HONEY HONEY IT IS NOT LOOKING GOOD 
BRITAIN'S HONEYBEES COULD DIE OUT 
IN TEN YEARS IT WON'T JUST BE YOUR 
BREAKFAST THAT WILL BE AFFECT 
RICHARD WESTCOTT IS IN HARPENDEN IN 
HERTFORDSHIRE HERTFORDSHIRE WE ARE GETTING EXCITED WE HAVE 
SET UP A BEE CAM IN THIS HIVE AND 
HOPEFULLY MIKE AND THE TRUCK CAN 
SWITCH A COUPLE OF BUTTONS AND YOU 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE BEES 
INSIDE INSIDE IT IS COLD SO THEY WON'T WANT TO 
COME OUT THIS MORNING HOPEFULLY 
YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN 
THERE THIS MADE ME WHO KNEW 
NOTHING ABOUT HONEYBEES BEFORE SIT 
UP AND LISTEN BEES ARE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR SO MUCH OF OUR FOOD A THIRD OF 
THE THINGS WE PUT IN OUR MOUTHS AT 
SOME POINT IN THEIR CYCLE HAVE BEEN 
PALEN ATED B. Y. ZERO ZERO B. Y. ZERO ZERO Y. BEES 
HONEYBEES 
COLIN'S HIVE SHOULD BE BUZZING WITH 
ACTIVITY DRIPPING WITH NECTAR 
THEY ARE ALL DEAD 
THEY ARE ALL DEAD 
THE ONLY BEES LEFT ALIVE ARE ROBBER 
FROM OTHER COLINIES 
WHAT'S CONCERNING TO ME WHATEVER 
VIRUS IS PREVALENT HERE COULD BE 
IN THESE TWO HIVES 
YES YES BEEKEEPERS EXPECT SOME LOSES OVER 
THE WINTER BUT LAST YEAR AROUND 
ONE IN FIVE HIVES FAILED THEY 
WORRY THIS YEAR WILL BE THE SAME 
EXPERTS LIKE CHRIS PAINT A GRIM 
PICTURE PICTURE WE COULD BE LOOKING AT EXTINCTION 
OF HONEYBEES IN THE U. K. IN THE NEXT 
TEN YEARS WHAT HAPPENED ALREADY IS 
THAT MANAGED COLONIES ARE DECLINING 
WE KNOW THAT THE NUMBER OF WILD 
COLONIES IS ALMOST DROPPED TO ZERO 
I FEAR WE ARE ON THE EDGE OF 
SOMETHING THAT WON'T BECOME 
APPARENT UNTIL THE CONSEQUENCES 
BECOME IRREVERSIBLE 
THAT'S WHY WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT 
TO SPEND EIGHT MILLION FINDING OUT 
WHAT IS KILLING THEM OFF 
WHY ARE HONEYBEES IMPORTANT HOW DO 
THEY AFFECT YOUR LIFE 
LOOK AROUND YOUR KITCHEN AND YOUR 
BATHROOM SO MANY THINGS RELY ON 
POLLINATING HONEYBEES SUPER FOODS 
LIKE BRISTOL COLLIE AND BLUEBERRIES 
KIWI FRUIT AND ALMONDAY COTTON TOO 
AND ONIONS 
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT HONEYBEES PLAY 
A PART IN THIRD OF THE THINGS WE EAT EAT SOMETHING ELSE WORRYING BEEKEEPERS 
LIKE CHRIS AND COLIN COLONY 
COLLAPSE DISORDER RAVAGED HIVES IN 
AMERICA AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S 
CAUSING IT OR WHETHER IT WILL END 
UP HERE THE U. S. GOVERNMENT IS 
SPENDING MILLIONS ON RESEARCH 
HAAGEN DAZS CHIPPED IN SAYING HALF 
ITS FLAVOURS WON'T MAKE IT INTO THE 
TUBS WITHOUT THE HONEYBEE 
HOW WORRIED ARE YOU ABOUT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IN AMERICA 
WE ARE VERY 
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IS IS HAPPENING 
IN AMERICA IT IS POSSIBLE IS COULD 
TRANSLATE INTO THE U. K. MANY OF THE 
BEE KEEPING PRACTISES ARE THE SAME 
BEEKEEPERS CLAIM IF WE LOSE THIS 
VITAL LINK IN THE FOOD CHAIN OUR 
MOST EFFICIENT FOOD POLLINATER 
LET'S LOOK AT OUR LIVE BEE CAM 
THIS IS WHAT BEES DO AT THIS TIME 
OF THE MORNING NOT A LOT 
YOU LOOK AT BEE RESEARCH WE ARE 
HEARING A LOT OF DEVASTATING 
COMMENTS LIKE THEY COULD BE DYING 
OUT IN TEN YEARS IS IT THAT 
SERIOUS 
ONLY THE BEEKEEPERS KNOW SERIOUS HOW BAD IT IS FOR THEM BUT WE ARE 
SEEING FEWER BEES POLLINATING OUR 
CROPS AND PROVIDING THE FRUIT AND 
SEED THAT THE BIRDS EAT 
WHY ARE THEY IMPORTANT IS THERE 
NOT SOMETHING ARTIFICIAL THAT CAN 
POLLINATE IN THE SAME WAY BEES BEES COLLECT THE POLLEN FOR THEIR BABIES 
WHETHER IT IS WILD BEES O. R. ZERO ZERO QUI 
BEES THEY ARE HONEYBEES THEY 
ARE VERY GOOD AT IT 
WHAT ARE WE FACING ARE WE TALKING 
ABOUT EMPTY FIELDS IS IT THAT 
DEVASTATING 
I AM NOT SURE IT WILL DEVASTATING BE THAT BAD BUT IT IS A SERIOUS 
PROBLEM AND FARMERS ARE STARTING TO 
FIND IT A PROBLEM FINDING ENOUGH 
BEES A LOT OF THE FRUIT AND 
VEGETABLES WE EAT RELY ON THE BEES 
SO WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM 
THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE RESEARCH TO 
TELL US HOW THEY ARE POLLINATING 
THE PLANTS BUT HOW WE CAN FIND 
SOLUTIONS FOR THE BEEKEEPERS 
WHAT ABOUT THE SITUATION IN 
AMERICA 
THAT SEEMS TO BE REALLY AMERICA BAD THEY HAVE ALMOND CROPS WHICH 
ARE HIGH VALUE CROPS AND NEED 
THOUSANDS OF BEE COLONIES TO 
POLLINATE THOSE AND THEY HAVE A 
REAL CRISIS WITH THAT AT THE MOMENT 
I WANT TO TELL YOU THE GOVERNMENT'S 
RESPONSE THEY SAY WE SPEND ONE POINT THREE 
BILLION ON THE BEE KEEPING FORCE 
AND SPEND MONEY ON RESEARCH THEY 
SAY THAT MONEY IS KEPT STEADY THAT 
SHOWS THEY ARE COMMITTED TO LOOKING 
INTO BEES 
WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT THEY TAG 
BEES THEY ELECTRONICALLY TAG THEM 
AND FOLLOW THEM BY RADAR AND WE 
WILL LOOK AT BEE TAG 
THAT GOES ON THEIR LEG 
IT GOES ON THEIR BACK 
WE CAN TRACK WHERE THEY ARE FLYING 
AND FIND OUT HOW THEY ARE FORRAGING 
IN THE CROPS 
AMAZING AMAZING A LITTLE BEE TAG FOR YOU AMAZING AMAZING DOES THAT HURT HOW DO THEY STICK 
IT ON 
I DON'T KNOW 
YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT BEES 
ALL THESE QUESTIONS 
THE BEAUTY OF THE FILM THERE IS 
THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE MATHS AND I 
THINK THAT IT MAKES SENSE BUT AT 
THE SAME TIME YOU DON'T NEED TO 
UNDERSTAND IT TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW 
THE STORY WHICH IS IMPORTANT 
I DIDN'T L. L. TALK MURDER 
AND MYSTERY AND MATHS WITH ELIJAH WOOD 
IT IS COMPLICATED STUFF SAID 
JUST GET ON WITH THE MURDERS IT 
IS TRUE 
GOOD MORNING

LONDON'S DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

BREAKFAST SHOW 
MORNING THIS IS B. R. S. BREAKFAST WITH 
SIAN WILLIAMS AND BILL TURNBULL 
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME THE MAIN 
NEWS THIS MORNING THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE SAYING THIS 
MORNING THAT MILLIONS OF POUNDS ARE 
BEING WASTED ON SCHEME TO COMBAT 
PASSPORT FRAUD FACE TO FACE 
INTERVIEWS WERE ANNOUNCED FOR ALL 
FIRST APPLICANTS AS CRACKDOWN ON 
FRAUDULENT PASSPORTS BUT THE 
CENTRES SAY THAT ALTHOUGH NINETY THOUSAND 
APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE NOT 
ONE HAS BEEN TURNED DOWN SO KEITH 
DOYLE IS THERE IS THE SYSTEM NOT 
WORKING 
THEY SAY THE SYSTEM IS WORKING WORKING THEY ARE SAYING THAT THIS 
NETWORK OF CENTRES WHERE PEOPLE 
WILL HAVE TO GO AND HAVE A FACE TO 
FACE INTERVIEW FOR AROUND TWENTY 
MINUTES TO PROVE WHO THEY SAY THEY 
ARE THEY ARE SAYING IT WILL CRACK 
DOWN ON FRAUDULENT APPLICATIONS 
BECAUSE PEOPLE MAKING FRAUDULENT 
APPLICATIONS WON'T COME FORWARD IN 
THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IS WHY 
THEY ARE SAYING THAT OUT OF THE 
NINETY THOUSAND INTERVIEWS WHILE ARE STILL 
BEING INVESTIGATED NONE HAVE BEEN 
TURNED DOWN K. AND THE COST OF A NEW 
PASSPORT HAS GONE UP AND TWELVE POINT FIVE OH OF 
THAT PAYMENT GOES TO THE UPKEEP OF 
THESE CENTRES BUT YOU CAN GET A 
FALSE PASSPORT ON THE BLACK MARKET 
FOR AROUND FIVE HUNDRED SO THE TORIES ARE 
SAYING THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE SYSTEM 
WHICH IS ENCOURAGING CRIMINALS TO 
GET A FAKE PASSPORT ELSEWHERE AND 
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO 
SUFFER FROM THIS NEW SYSTEM ARE THE 
LEGITIMATE APPLICATIONS WHO HAVE TO 
PAY THE MONEY AND SIT THE 
INTERVIEWS 
IN A FEW MINUTES WE'LL INTERVIEWS PUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES RAISED TO 
THE HEAD OF THE IDENTITY AND 
PASSPORT SERVICE

WANT TO SEND IN YOUR QUESTIONS 
THE N. H. S. IS BEING URGED TO MAKE 
GREATER USE OF A NEW ANTI BLOOD 
CLOTTING DRUG THAT COULD SAVE 
PATIENTS' LIVES EVERY YEAR THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND COULD THROW A FIFTY 
BILLION LIFELINE TO BANKS 
STRUGGLING THE IMPACT OF THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH UNDER THE PLAN BANKS WILL 
BE ABLE TO SWAP THEIR POTENTIALLY 
RISKY MORTGAGE DEBTS WITH SECURE 
GOVERNMENT BONDS THE MOVE IS BEING 
SEEN AS THE MOST AMBITIOUS ATTEMPT 
BY ANY CENTRAL BANK SO FAR TO 
RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE INDUSTRY 
SNIPE POLICE HAVE ARRESTED A TWENTY SIX

KNOCKDOWN TO WIN THE FIGHT ON A 
SPLIT DECISION HE PRODUCED A MORE 
AGGRESSIVE DISPLAY THAN HOPKINS I I FELT QUITE CONFIDENT AT LIGHT 
HEAVYWEIGHT SO IT IS GREAT TO HAVE 
THE OPTIONS I'LL FIGHT PROBABLY 
ONE MORE FIGHT OF MY CAREER BUT IT 
WILL HAVE TO BE A BIG FIGHT 
YOU RULE OUT RETIREMENT YOU THINK

PETER EBDON STAGED LATE COMEBACK 
TO DEFEAT JAMIE COPE AND HAWKINS 
WAS NOT HAPPY WHEN HIS MATCH 
SPILLED OVER INTO THE EVENING 
SESSION SESSION I WORRY ABOUT JOE CALZAGHE WHEN HE 
SAYS ONE MORE FIGHT 
AND HE WANTS 
TO TAKE ON ROY JONES JUNIOR AND HE 
SAYS HE WANTS THE FIGHT IN CARDIFF 
BECAUSE OF HIS NAME JONES 
THAT WILL BE INTERESTING THEY WERE 
A WEAPON IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME 
DESIGNED TO CATCH FRAUDSTERS 
SEEKING FALSE IDEASITS PEOPLE 
APPLYING FOR A NEW PASSPORT WOULD 
HAVE TO BE INTERVIEWED BUT SINCE 
THE SCHEME STARTED NOT ONE 
APPLICANT HAS BEEN REJECTED AND THE 
CONSERVATIVES SAY THE SCHEME IS 
COMPLETELY USELESS LET'S PUT THAT 
TO BERNARD HERDAN THE HEAD OF THE 
IDENTITY AND PASSPORT SERVICE 
NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED 
SO FAR AND NOT ONE PERSON HAS BEEN 
FOUND TO BE A FRAUDSTER THEY ARE 
ALL UPSTANDING LEGITIMATE CITIZENS 
IS THIS THE RIGHT WAY TO TRY TO 
FIND FRAUDSTERS BY SETTING UP 
CENTRES IN THIS WAY ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY PASSPORT FRAUD IS A HUGE PROBLEM IN 
THIS COUNTRY AS IT IS LINKED TO 
TERRORISM AND ORGANISED CRIME AND 
THE INTERVIEW IS AN IMPORTANT PART 
OF IT BUT IT IS LINK THE TO A LOT 
OF OTHER TECHNIQUES WE USE TO DETER 
AND DETECT FRAUD AND THIS IS 
PARTICULARLY A DETERRENCE FACTOR 
BUT IT IS COSTING EACH INDIVIDUAL 
WHO APPLIES FOR A PASSPORT TWELVE POINT FIVE OH 
THAT IS BUILT INTO THE FEE WE ALL 
PAY WHICH IS SEVENTY TWO NOW YES 
WHAT I YES AM SUGGESTING IS THIS TWELVE POINT FIVE OH MAY 
NOT BE THE BEST WAY TO TRACK DOWN 
THE FRAUDSTERS BECAUSE THEY'RE 
GOING FOR LOST AND STOLEN PASSPORTS 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TURN UP IN 
YOUR OFFICE FOR A FACE TO FACE 
INTERVIEW ARE THEY 
MUCH OF THE 
FEE NOW IS TO DO WITH KAUNTER FRAUD 
TO PAYING THE PASSPORT MORE SECURE 
AGAINST COUNTERFEITING SO BY THE 
TIME PEOPLE COME FOR AN INTERVIEW 
THEY WILL HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT 
OF PRIOR CHECKS AND PEOPLE WILL 
HAVE FADED AWAY BECAUSE WE WILL 
HAVE ASKED THEM THINGS TO SHOW WE 
ARE ON TO THEM AND BY THE TIME 
THEY COME TO INTERVIEW THEY THERE 
HAVE GONE THROUGH THAT WE HAVE 
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED INVESTIGATIONS ONGOING AT 
THIS TIME AND IN THE NEXT FEW 
MONTHS WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WE WILL HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO DETER 
SO YOU'RE SAYING 
THEY WILL BE DETERED BEFORE THEY 
GET TO INTERVIEW 
WE HOPE SO WE'LL 
BE ABLE TO CHECK THOSE WHO HAVE 
LOST CONTACT WITH US BEFORE THEY 
COME TO INTERVIEW AND I'VE SPOKEN 
TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD AN INTERVIEW 
OUR CUSTOMERS AND NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF THEM ARE 
SATISFIED WITH THE EXPERIENCE AND 
ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE SAY THEY 
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS A WEAPON IN 
THE FIGHT AGAINST FRAUD AND HOW 
WE'RE BEING EFFECTIVE IN THE FIGHT 
A GENS THE THEFT OF THEIR 
IDENTITIES MANY OF THESE PEOPLE 
ARE NOT IN THIS COUNTRY AT THE 
MOMENT APPLYING AND THEY ARE 
APPLYING THROUGH FACILITATORS AND 
IF ANYONE TRIES TO USE A LOST OR 
STOLEN PASSPORT THERE ARE A WHOLE 
RANGE OF OTHER CHECKS WE'RE USING 
TO DETER THOSE SO PEOPLE SHOULD BE 
ASSURED IT IS NOT AS EASY AS IT 
SOUNDS 
IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST SOUNDS OUTRAGES OF THE TROUBLES OF 
NORTHERN IRELAND ONE PEOPLE WERE 
KILLED WHEN A BOMB WENT OFF AS THE 
REMEMBRANCE DAY PARADE AT 
ENNISKILLEN THERE ARE NOW PEOPLE 
SAYING THAT MARTIN MCGUINESS WAS 
INVOLVED IN THAT BOMBING WHAT DO 
YOU KNOW ABOUT IT 
IT HAS LONG BEEN 
ASSUMED THAT THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED 
OUT BY FIVE POSSIBLY RENEGADE UNIT OF 
THE I. R. A. BUT WE'VE ESTABLISHED 
THERE WERE THREE UNITS INVOLVED 
TWO FROM THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE 
BORDER AND ONE FROM THE NORTH AND 
CLEARLY SUCH AN ATTACK WAS CO 
ORDINATED BECAUSE THERE WAS ANOTHER 
ATTACK PLANNED FOR THE SAME AREA 
AND I INTERVIEWED THE CHIEF 
INVESTIGATOR FOR THE ENNISKILLEN 
ATTACK AND HE CONFIRMED THAT THE 
NORTHERN COMMAND WHICH WAS THE 
BODY IN CHARGE OF THE WAR IN THE 
NORTH KNEW OF THE ATTACK AND DID 
NOT STOP IT PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME 
INDEPENDENTLY THAT THE LEADING 
FIGURE ON THE NORTHERN COMMAND AT 
THE TIME WAS MARTIN MCGUINNESS WHO 
IS NOW DEPUTY FIRST MINISTER AND 
THESE REPORTS ALSO SAY THAT MR. 
MCGUINNESS VISITED UNITS ON BOTH 
SIDES OF THE BORDER WHO WERE 
ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN THE ATTACKS 
BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE BORDER 
AND THE REPORTS ALLEGE THERE WAS A 
DISPUTE WITHIN THE I. R. A. FOLLOWING 
THE CEASEFIRE AND GERRY ADAMS WAS 
IN FAVOUR OF A CEASEFIRE AND MARTIN 
MCGUINNESS WAS NOT 
WHAT IS THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT YOU REVEAL I I THINK THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE IS THAT 
SEVERAL OF THE VICTIMS OF THIS 
HORRENDOUS ATTACK PEOPLE WHO LOST 
LOVED ONES IN THE ATTACK PAY 
RESPECT TO MARTIN MCGUINNESS 
DESPITE THE HORRORS THEY WENT 
THROUGH AND BELIEVE HIS 
TRANSFORMATION FROM TERRORIST TO 
STATESMAN TO POLITICIAN IS 
SOMETHING THAT THEY WELCOME THEY 
WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE PEACE TODAY 
THAN WHAT THEY HAVE HAD IN 
SO IN THE END IT IS A GOOD NEWS 
STORY OUT OF ALL THE HORROR 
IT IS MARRED TO STOMACH HIM BEING 
THE DEPUTY FIRST MINISTER IF IT WAS 
HIM WHO GAVE THE GO AHEAD FOR THE 
BOMB IN ENNISKILLEN BUT HAVING 
PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS THE 
BEST THING THAT HAPPENED IT IT IS 
WHAT HARD PILL TO SWALLOW BUT I 
WOULD RATHER BE WHERE WE ARE NOW 
THAN BACK IN THE TROUBLES 
THAT WAS AN INTERVIEW WITH STEPHEN 
GAULT HIS FATHER WAS KILLED 
THE FACT THAT STEPHEN CAN ACCEPT 
THE JOURNEY THAT SINN FEIN AND THE 
I. R. A. MADE IS A TRIBUTE TO THE PEOPLE 
WHO DIED AND A TRIBUTE TO MARTIN 
MCGUINNESS AS WELL 
AGE OF TERROR TOMORROW NIGHT ON B. B. C. 
TWO 
NOT A SINGLE PASSPORT APPLICATION 
HAS BEEN TURNED DOWN AS RESULT OF 
THE GOVERNMENT'S STRICT NEW 
INTERVIEW PROCEDURE 
THOUSANDS OF LIVES COULD BE SAVED 
IF THE N. H. S. MADE GREATER USE OF A 
NEW DRUG TREATMENT FOR BLOOD CLOTS 
CRACKING DOWN ON DANGEROUS DRIVING 
WE WILL BE HEARING ABOUT WHAT LANCE 
ARE IN FORCE TO STOP PEOPLE FROM 
DRIVING DANGEROUSLY MORE ON THAT

SHUT DOWN ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
JOINS US FROM MANCHESTER 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
GOOD MORNING 
YOU ARE UNDER PRESSURE FROM 
SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER AND FROM 
THE BUSINESS SECRETARY TO RESTART 
TALKS ARE YOU IN A POSITION TO GO 
BACK INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE 
UNIONS UNIONS WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THAT 
POSITION AND CERTAINLY ARE WE 
THINK IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE SIT 
DOWN AND WE TALK BECAUSE WE WILL 
NOT RESOLVE THIS UNLESS WE DO AND 
WE ARE ENCOURAGING THE UNION TO DO 
THE SAME 
THIS TALK ABOUT A POSSIBLE FUEL 
SHORTAGE IS THIS SERIOUS OR ARE 
YOU SCAREMONGERING TO GET A 
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE 
WE ARE NOT 
SCAREMONGERING WE ARE SCOTLAND'S 
ONLY REFINERY AND WE SUPPLY THE 
WHOLE OF SCOTLAND WITH FUEL IF 
THAT REFINERY IS NOT WORKING IT 
WILL BE SHUT DOWN BY NEXT SUNDAY 
AND IT WILL STAY DOWN FOR UP TO A 
MONTH BECAUSE IT TAKES A LONG TIME 
TO RESTART THE ASSETS WE ARE NOT 
NOT SCAREMONGERING THAT'S THE 
TRUTH WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN 
THAT'S WHY WE MUST HAVE THE UNIONS 
AROUND THE TABLE QUICKLY 
THE UNIONS SAY THEY HAVEN'T BEEN 
INVITED TO ATTEND TALKS AT ACAS 
YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK THEM WE HAVE 
BEEN INVITED AND WE HAVE SAID YES 
AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY HAVE 
BEEN INVITED AS WELL THIS STRIKE 
DOES NOT NEED TO HAPPEN WE ARE NOT 
ASKING FOR ANYTHING RIDICULOUS WE 
HAVE A PENSION SCHEME UP AT THAT 
SITE THAT'S THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY 
PEOPLE PAY NO CONTRIBUTION FOR 
THEIR PENSION AND THAT CAN'T GO ON 
WE ARE ASKING MEMBERS TO CONTRACT 
WE ARE CLOSING THE SCHEME TO NEW 
NEW MEMBERS BUT WE HAVE TO DO THAT 
BECAUSE WE WILL SPEND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION 
OVER FIVE YEARS ON THIS SITE AND WE 
CAN'T DO THAT IF WE ARE 
UNCOMPETITIVE WE HAVE TO COMPETE 
WITH THE CHINESE AND THE INIANS AND 
IF INDIANS IF WE ARE 
UNCOMPETITIVE ON THAT SITE HOW CAN 
WE SPEND THAT MONEY 
YOU SAY YOU 
HAVE TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH 
REFINERIES IN CHINA SERIOUSLY HOW

BASIC OIL PRODUCT AROUND TO OTHER 
REFINERIES IN THIS WAY YOU PRESENT

COMPETITION IS WITH REFINERIES IN 
EUROPE

INTEGRATED PETROL COMPLEX WE SELL 
A WHOLE RANGE OF CHEMICAL PRODUCTS 
FROM THAT SITE AND THOSE ARE THE 
PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE AROUND THE 
WORLD THEY HAVE TO BE COMPETITIVE 
OTHERWISE WE CAN'T RUN THEM WE 
CAN'T REINVEST ON THE BAY IS OF 
HAVING AN UNCOMPETITIVE SITUATION 
IF THE UNIONS WON'T CO OPERATE WITH 
US HOW CAN WE MAKE THAT COMMITMENT 
AND INVESTMENT GOING BACK COUPLE 
OF STEPS SOME WILL WONDER WHY YOU 
ARE SHUTTING DOWN THE PLANT NOW 
WHEN THE STRIKE ISN'T UNTIL THE END 
OF THE WEEK 
WE HAVE A HUGELY 
COMPLEX INTEGRATED SYSTEM THERE 
ARE MANY UNITS THEY HAVE TO BE 
SHUT DOWN IN A SEQUENCE AND WE ARE 
GOING THROUGH THE SEQUENCE NOW 
SOME UNITS ARE COMING OFF UNTIL NOW 
AND SOME WON'T COME OFF UNTIL THE 
DAY BEFORE WE HAVE TO GET THE 
TEMPERATURES DOWN WE DON'T WANT TO 
DO THAT BECAUSE IT COSTS US A LOT 
OF MONEY BUT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE 
TO DO IF WE ARE A RESPONSIBLE 
OPERATOR OF THAT SITE 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

GOOD MORNING THIS IS BREAKFAST 
PASSPORT FRAUD THE NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
ARE INTERVIEWED AT APPLICATION 
CENTRES BUT NOT ONE PERSON IS 
TURNED DOWN 
GOOD MORNING WELCOME IF YOU HAVE 
JUST JOINED US IT'S MONDAY TWENTY FIRST 
APRIL ALSO AHEAD TODAY THOUSANDS 
DIE FROM BLOOD CLOTS NOW A NEW 
DRUG COULD REDUCE THE RISK FROM 
HOSPITAL OPERATIONS THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND THROWS FIVE FIFTY BILLION 
LIFELINE TO THE HIGH STREET BANKS 
IT IS HOPED IT WILL DRIVE DOWN OUR 
MORTGAGE COSTS 
AND QUICK LOOK AT OUR LIVE BEE 
CAM INSIDE THIS HIVE THIS MORNING 
BEES POLLINATE AROUND THIRD OF 
THE FOOD WE EAT BUT THERE ARE 
WARNINGS THAT THEY 
A WORRYING RATE AND NO ONE 
A WORRYING RATE AND NO ONE KNOWS WHY WHY COMING UP 
BAFFY WAFFY WIM W. A. M. 
HE MAKES NO SENSE BUT HE DOES MAKE 
YOU LAUGH IN A NIGHT TO REMEMBER 
WITH THE TELEVISION BAFTAS THEY 
WERE ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR AS A MAJOR 
CRACKDOWN ON PASSPORT FRAUD A 
MULTI MILLION POUND NETWORK OF 
CENTRES WHERE ALL NEW APPLICANTS 
WOULD HAVE TO ATTEND A FACE TO FACE 
INTERVIEW BUT NOW BREAKFAST HAS 
LEARNED THAT NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN INTERVIEWED AND NOT SINGLE 
APPLICATION HAS BEEN TURNED DOWN 
SOME SAY IT HAS BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS 
BUT CRITICS SAY IT IS A WASTE OF 
MONEY KOITH DOYLE IS AT ONE CENTRE 
HERE AT THE IDENTITY AND PASSPORT 
SERVICE THEY BELIEVE THEY ISSUED 
AROUND TEN THOUSAND PASSPORTS LAST YEAR 
BASED ON FALSE APPLICATIONS AND 
THEY SAY THE WAY TO COMBAT THIS IS 
THROUGH FACE TO FACE INTERVIEWS AND 
THEY HAVE SET UP A NETWORK OF 
CENTRES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHERE 
ANYONE APPLYING FOR A PASSPORT FOR 
THE FIRST TIME WILL HAVE TO ATTEND 
A FACE TO FACE INTERVIEW FALSE 
IDENTITIES HAVE BEEN TERRORIST 
WEAPON LAST YEAR BARRATT WAS 
JAILED FOR LIFE FOR PLOTTING A 
SPATE OF ATTACKS ACROSS BRITAIN HE 
HAD NUMEROUS PASSPORTS SOME WITH 
FRAUDULENT IDENTITIES IT IS 
BELIEVED TEN THOUSAND FRAUDULENT 
PASSPORTS WERE ISSUED LAST YEAR 
AND HALF CAME FROM FIRST TIME 
APPLICATIONS 
CAN I ASK YOU TO APPLICATIONS CONFIRM YOUR FULL NAME PLEASE YES YES IT'S LES SMITH 
LAST YEAR THE 
CENTRES PROMISED TO INTERVIEW EVERY 
ADULT APPLYING FOR A FIRST TIME 
PASSPORT AND JUST UNDER NINETY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED AND 
WHILST SOME ARE BEING INVESTIGATED 
NOT ONE HAS BEEN TURNED DOWN BUT 
THE HEAD OF THE SERVICE SAYS THAT 
IS NOT A SIGN OF FAILURE I'M I'M SATISFIED THIS IS A SUCCESSFUL 
SYSTEM THE MAIN EFFECT WILL BE 
FRAUD DETERRENCE AND WE'LL PROVE 
THAT THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OVER THE 
NEXT TWELVE MONTHS THERE WILL BE 
PEOPLE WHO WILL ATTEMPT TO APPLY 
AND WHO ARE DETERED BY THE PROCESS 
OF ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION 
BEFORE INTERVIEW AND THEN THEY'LL 
COME FOR AN INTERVIEW AND SOME OF 
THE CASES MAY TURN OUT TO BE FRAUD 
LENT 
THE COST OF A PASSPORT HAS LENT RISEN SHARPLY IT IS NOW SEVENTY TWO 
TWELVE POINT FIVE OH OF THAT AMOUNT GOES TO 
PROVIDING THE NEW SERVICE WHETHER 
YOU ARE APPLYING FOR A FIRST 
PASSPORT OR NOT AND SOME SAY IT IS 
A WASTE OF MONEY 
TERRORISTS AND 
ORGANISED CRIME GANGS ARE NOT GOING 
TO GAIN A PASSPORT THROUGH THIS 
ROUTE IT IS COSTING BRITISH 
CITIZENS TWELVE POINT FIVE OH A HEAD AND A 
SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF THE COST OF A 
PASSPORT IS GOING ON THESE 
INTERVIEWS WHICH SO FAR ARE 
PROVING TO BE USELESS 
SOME SAY IT 
WILL BRING BENEFITS BUT THE 
DETERMINED WILL FIND WAYS OF 
GETTING AROUND IT 
THE CRIMINALS 
WILL FIND WAYS TO GET THE PASSPORTS 
THEY WANT AND THE SYSTEM IS ONLY AS 
GOOD AS THE WEAKEST PASSPORT OFFICE 
IN BRITAIN AND FAKE ONES ARE ON 
THE MARKET FOR FIVE HUNDRED 
THE IDENTITY 
AND PASSPORT SERVICE SAYS BY THE 
END OF THE YEAR EVERY NEW APPLICANT 
WILL FACE AN INTERVIEW BUT IT WILL 
BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE KNOW IF THIS 
EXPENSIVE SYSTEM HAS HAD AN IMPACT 
THE IDENTITY AND PASSPORT SERVICE 
DOES ADMIT THAT CRIMINALS WILL BE 
LOOKING ELSEWHERE TO GET THEIR 
FALSE PASSPORTS AND WE KNOW THERE 
IS A HUGE BLACK MARKET IN FOLLOWS 
PASSPORTS WE'VE HEARD YOU CAN PICK 
ONE UP FOR AROUND FIVE HUNDRED BUT THE 
SERVICE SAYS THAT MAKING THE 
APPLICATION PROCESS MORE ROBUST IS 
PART OF THE SOLUTION TO COMBAT IT 
AND THEY BELIEVE THAT BY HAVING 
FACE TO FACE INTERVIEWS IS CUTTING 
OFF ONE ROUTE BUT WITH THE 
EXPENSIVE NETWORK OF CENTRES ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY IT APPEARS THEY ARE 
ONLY INTERVIEWING PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO HIDE THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE N. H. S. IS BEING URGED TO MAKE 
GREATER USE OF A NEW TREATMENT TO 
PREVENT BLOOD CLOTS WHICH 
CAMPAIGNERS SAY COULD SAVE 
THOUSANDS OF LIVES EVERY YEAR SO 
FAR THE DRUG HAS BEEN LICENSED 
ONLY FOR USE ON PATIENTS WHO HAVE 
HIP AND KNEE OPERATIONS 
SHARON FRANKLIN HAS HAD TWO HIP 
REPLACEMENT OPERATIONS AFTER THE 
FIRST ONE SHE DEVELOPED A BLOOD 
CLOT IN A VEIN IT IS VERY PAINFUL 
AND POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS SO 
BEFORE THE SECOND OPERATION SHARON 
HAD WEEKS OF BLOOD THINNING 
INJECTIONS 
THE PREVENT ANOTHER INJECTIONS BLOOD CLOT FOR MY SECOND HIP 
OPERATION THEY GAVE ME A COURSE OF 
HEPARIN INJECTIONS FOR SIX WEEKS 
THAT WAS LIKE HAVING A BEE STING 
DAILY THE PAIN WAS IMMENSE 
BLOOD CLOTS IN HOSPITAL PATIENTS 
ARE SERIOUS PROBLEM THEY ARE 
THOUGHT TO CAUSE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DEATHS IN 
ENGLAND EACH YEAR IT COSTS AROUND 
SIX HUNDRED FORTY MILLION A YEAR TO MANAGE THE 
HEALTH EFFECTS FIFTY PER CENT OF PATIENTS IN 
HIP REPLACEMENT OPERATIONS ARE AT 
RISK BUT THAT RISK CAN BE CUT 
DRAMATICALLY WITH BLOOD THINNING 
DRUGS BEFORE SURGERY 
UNTIL NOW PATIENTS HAVE HAD 
INJECTIONS WITH CONSTANT MONITORING 
BEFORE THEIR OPERATION IT IS HOPED 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PILL WILL GIVE 
DOCTORS ANOTHER OPTION 
A TABLET IS VERY MUCH EASIER TO 
GIVE IT IS MUCH BETTER FOR THE 
NURSING STAFF AS WELL AS THE 
PATIENTS AND SO WE HOPE IT WILL 
BRING EXCITEMENT AND FRESHNESS TO 
THE AREA AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO 
GIVE BLOOD THINNERS 
EACH YEAR 
THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS LIKE SHARON 
HAVE OPERATIONS BETTER SCREENING 
AND PRE SURGERY TREATMENT COULD 
AVOID THE PAIN SHE WENT THROUGH 
FROM A BLOOD CLOT 
AND IN A FEW MINUTES WE'LL ASK DOCTOR 
ROSEMARY WHETHER THIS NEW TREATMENT 
WILL SAVE LIVES THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND COULD THROW A FIFTY BILLION 
LIFELINE TO BANKS STRUGGLING WITH 
THE IMPACT OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
UNDER THE PLAN BANKS WILL BE ABLE 
TO SWAP THEIR POTENTIALLY RISKY 
MORTGAGE DEBTS WITH SECURE 
GOVERNMENT BONDS THE MOVE IS BEING 
SEEN AS THE MOST AMBITIOUS ATTEMPT 
BY ANY CENTRAL BANK SO FAR TO TRY 
TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE 
INDUSTRY DECLAN LET'S CROSS TO 
HIM NOW BECAUSE THERE IS NEWS FROM 
THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND THIS 
MORNING WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD THIS THIS HAS JUST COME IN IN THE LAST FEW 
MINUTES AND IT IS A BRIEF STATEMENT 
THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND SAYS IT 
IS CONSIDERING A WRITES ISSUE IN 
OTHER WORDS IT IS CONSIDERING GOING 
TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS TO RAISE MONEY 
TO HELP THE CREDIT CRISIS WE NOW 
THINK THAT THE DETAILS OF THE PLAN 
WILL COME TOMORROW 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
M. P.'S GO BACK TO WESTMINSTER TODAY 
AFTER THEIR EASTER BREAK WITH THE 
ROW STILL RAGING OVER GORDON 
BROWN'S DECISION TO END THE TEN P. 
RATE OF INCOME TAX REBELS ARE 
WANTING COMPENSATION FOR THE FIVE 
MILLION PEOPLE ESTIMATED TO HAVE 
LOST OUT OUR POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT VICKY YOUNG IS WITH 
US SO IT FINALLY COMES TO A HEAD 
THAT'S RIGHT WE'VE HAD TWO WEEKS OF 
AN EASTER BREAK AND TODAY THERE IS 
A DEBATE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS A 
GENERAL DEBATE ABOUT THE BUDGET 
BUT M. P.'S WILL GET A CHANCE TO 
ABOUT THE TEN RATE SO WE WILL GET 
AN IDEA OF THE STRENGTH OF FEELING 
FROM THE M. P.'S AND HOW THEY FEEL 
ABOUT IT AND IT COMES JUST A 
COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS IN WALES AND ENGLAND AND AND ALISTAIR DARLING IS SAYING HE CAN'T 
RE WRITE THE BUDGET SO THEY'LL 
THINK IT IS NOT MUCH OF A REBELLIAN 
AFTER ALL 
HE HAS TO CLARIFY TO THE AFTER ALL M. P.'S WHETHER THERE IS A COMPENSATION 
PACKAGE OR NOT THERE HAS BEEN 
CONFUSION HE SAYS HE CAN'T RE 
WRITE IT BUT HE WILL COME BACK TO 
IT IN THE FUTURE AND IT IS A 
QUESTION WHETHER M. P.'S THINK THAT IS 
H. IS ENOUGH THE FACT THAT THERE 
ARE MINISTERIAL AIDES GOING OPENLY 
TO REPORTERS TELLING THEM THEY'RE 
UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS THAT IS QUITE 
AN OPEN REBELLION SO IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE IF THE PROMISE 
OF ANOTHER LOOK WILL BE ENOUGH TO 
QUELL IT AND THERE ARE ALL THESE 
RUMOURS ABOUT ANONYMOUS BRIEFINGS 
AND WE HAVE THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER 
DAVID CAMERON THE FIRST DAY BACK 
AT SCHOOL AND WE HAVE HIM BACK ON 
THE SOFIA SO IF YOU HAVE ANY 
QUESTIONS FOR HIM ON THAT THE 
BEST QUESTIONS COME FROM YOU OR ON 
ANYTHING ELSE DO SEND THEM TO US 
THE POLICE UNIT SET UP TO COMBAT 
INTERNET CHILD SEX ABUSE IS 
REPORTING A SUCCESS CEOP SAYS THAT 
SINCE APRIL LAST YEAR IT HAS 
ARRESTED NEARLY THREE HUNDRED SEX OFFENDERS 
AND SMASHED SIX ORGANISED 
PAEDOPHILE RINGS POLICE IN 
BIRMINGHAM HAVE ARRESTED MAN ON 
SUSPICION OF MURDERING A PEDESTRIAN 
WHO WAS HIT BY CAR NEAR ASTON 
VILLA'S GROUND YESTERDAY THE 
INCIDENT HAPPENED AFTER VILLA'S FIVE TO ONE 
WIN OVER BIRMINGHAM CITY COMEDY 
HITS GAVIN AND STACY AND HARRY 
HILL'S T. V. BURP HAVE TAKEN BAFTAS AT 
THE AWARDS CEREMONY AND EILEEN 
ATKINS WON BEST ABSENT REST 
IT IS T. V.'S BIG GLAMOUR EVENT 
ACTRESS AND THE WINNERS OF T. V.'S 
MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARDS RANGED 
WIDELY FROM COSTUME DRAMA IN 
CRANFORD THROUGH TO PF BURP MY MY NAME IS SAM TYLER T. V. PURPOSE L. 
HAD AN ACCIDENT AND WOKE UP AS AN 
OVEN READY CHICKEN 
HARRY HILL'S 
VERY ODD VIEW OF THE WEEK'S T. V. HAS 
WON ACCLAIM AND DAME EILEEN ATKINS 
PREVAILED OVER DAME JUDI DENCH TO 
WIN BEST ACTRESS FOR CANDFORD 
THERE WAS NO SEX AND CRANFORD 
THERE WAS NO SEX AND NO VIOLENCE 
AND I THINK IT WAS VERY VERY WITTY 
AND YOU HAD THIS PHALANX OF MIDDLE 
AGED ACTRESSES WHO KNEW EXACTLY 
WHAT THEY WERE DOING 
BUT THE 
STANDING OVATION WENT TO A MAN WHO 
HAD HIS BREAKTHROUGH AT THE 
PALLADIUM FIFTY YEARS AGO BUT THE 
COMEDY WAS WON BY GAVIN AND STACY 
YOU KNOW YOU WERE SAYING FIND 
ANOTHER WORD FOR T. V. BURP BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T HAPPY WITH IF 
IT 
HOW ABOUT T. V. EXCUSE ME 
BUT HE IS GENERALLY A FUNNY GUY 
BRITAIN IS IN THE MIDST OF A BLOOD 
CLOT EPIDEMIC TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE IN 
ENGLAND EVERY YEAR THAT IS THE 
WORRYING WARNING FROM THE CHARITY 
LIFEBLOOD AND IT WANTS DOCTORS TO 
PRESCRIBE A NEW PILL THAT COULD 
PREVENT BLOOD CLOTS TO DISCUSS IT 
IS DOCTOR ROSEMARY LEONARD GOOD GOOD MORNING 
TELL US ABOUT THIS DRUG MORNING AND WHAT IT MEANS 
THE MAIN THING 
ABOUT THIS DRUG IS IT IS AN 
ANTICOAGULANT TREATMENT THAT CAN BE 
GIVEN BY MOUTH AT THE MOMENT 
THERE ARE TWO TREATMENTS ONE BY 
INJECTION THE HEPARIN USED AT THE 
TIME OF SURGERY AND HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TAKING WARFARIN 
WHICH IS GIVEN BY MOUTH BUT YOU 
HAVE TO MONITOR IT VERY CAREFULLY 
IT IS VERY EASY TO OVERDOSE AND IT 
INTERACTS WITH OTHER DRUGS AND FOOD 
SO THERE ARE PROBLEMS TAKING 
WARFARIN SO THIS IS A NEW 
TREATMENT A ONCE DAILY DOSAGE AND 
I THINK IT WILL REVOLUTIONISE THE 
BLOOD CLOTTING PROBLEMS ANY ANY SETBACKS 
IT IS EARLY DAYS AND THIS SETBACKS DRUG HAS JUST HAD A LICENCE AND 
SOMETIMES SIDE EFFECTS DO BECOME 
MORE PARENT WHEN IT IS USED MORE 
WIDELY AND WITH A FEW PEOPLE YOU 
CAN GET BLEEDING BUT IT SEEMS TO 
BE REMARKABLY TOLERANT 
SO WHAT CAN HAPPEN NOW NORMALLY NORMALLY NICE GIVES A RECOMMENDATION L. 
SUSPECT IN THIS CASE THEY WILL 
FAST TRACK THROUGH THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS SO WE CAN USE THIS 
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
A FEW E. 
MAILS ONE FROM SUE FROM 
NORTHUMBERLAND SAYS I THOUGHT THE 
DAILY TAKING OF ASPIRIN CAN REDUCE 
BLOOT CLOTS IS THIS NO LONGER THE 
CASE 
THAT IS FINE FOR PEOPLE AT A CASE RISK OF BLOOT CLOTS BUT IF YOU ARE 
HAVING BLOOD CLOTS BUT IF YOU 
ARE HAVING A BIG PROCEDURE LIKE AN 
OPERATION ASPIRIN IS NOT ENOUGH 
AND WHY IS A DRUG USED ELSEWHERE 
NOT IN THIS COUNTRY 
IT IS USED FOR 
PREVENTING BLOOD PLATELETS STICKING 
TOGETHER BUT IT IS NOT USED IN 
THIS COUNTRY ATH MOMENT AND 
AND THEN WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR NICE TO 
RECOMMEND IT 
I SUSPECT THEY WILL 
SOON

OVER OVER ENERGY BILLS ARE SET TO SOAR BY 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOSE ARE YOUR PAPERS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
THE BEAUTY OF THE FILM 
IS THERE IS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE MATHS 
AND I THINK THAT IT ALL DOES MAKE 
SENSE BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU 
DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY 
UNDERSTAND IT TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW 
THE STORY WHICH I THINK IS 
IMPORTANT IMPORTANT THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT GOT TO 
TALK WITH ELIJAH WOOD 
BRITAIN'S HONEYBEES ARE IN TROUBLE 
WHY SHOULD YOU CARE WELL A THIRD 
OF THE THINGS YOU EAT HAVE BEEN 
POLLINATED BY A HONEYBEE IN THE 
FUTURE WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAPPEN 
TO FOOD PRICES IF THEY THEY DIE OUT 
WE HAVE PUT LIVE CAMERA INTO THIS 
HIVE WE CAN CUT TO IT NOW AND WE 
CAN LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE UP TO 
IT IS NICE TO SEE THAT BEE CAM AND 
THEY ARE TRACKING THEM 
THEY ARE 
THEY PUT AERIALS ON THEIR BACK 
WILL THERE BE SUNSHINE TODAY WE WE WILL PROBABLY GET IT LATER IN THE 
WEEK THROUGH THE WEEK WE WILL SEE 
MORE SUNSHINE AT TIMES 
WARMER THAN IT DID LAST LAST WEEK 
BUT FOR THE TIME BEING THERE IS A 
CHILL IN THE AIR THIS MORNING 
FOR MANY OF US IT IS A GREY AND 
CLOUDY START TO THE DAY QUITE 
MISTY AND MURKY IN ONE OR TWO SPOTS 
BUT TOWARDS THE FAR SOUTH WE HAVE 
GOT THE THE CLOUD THICKENING UP AND 
WE WILL START START TO SEE RAIN 
PUSH IN IT IS ALREADY THERE AND 
FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS WE HAVE GOT 
WETTER CONDITIONS GENERALLY SOUTH 
OF THE M. FOUR RUNNING ALL THE WAY FROM 
SUSSEX AND SURREY ACROSS THE SOUTH 
COASTAL AREAS TOWARDS THE SOUTH 
WEST AND SOUTH WALES 
SOME HEAVIER BURSTS OF RAIN IN 
THERE FURTHER NORTH IT IS DRY 
START WE HAVE SUNSHINE ACROSS 
NORTHERN PARTS OF SCOTLAND AND 
ELSEWHERE AFTER GREY START TO 
THE DAY WE WILL SEE MORE SUNSHINE 
COME THROUGH FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
INTO THIS AFTERNOON STILL ALWAYS 
BIT MORE CLOUD THAN SUNSHINE BUT 
IN THE SUNNIER ARE MOMENTS 
TEMPERATURES UP TO TWELVE CELSIUS A 
SIMILAR STORY ACROSS SCOTLANDMENT 
THERE WILL BE BRIGHTER WEATHER THIS 
AFTERNOON AND IN SCOTLAND THE WIND 
WILL BE LIGHT SO IT WON'T FEEL AS 
CHILLY NORTH WEST ENGLAND THE 
WEST MIDLANDS STAYING CLOUDY AND 
GREY BUT EASTERN PARTS OF ENG 
ENGLAND WE HAVE GOT THAT BREEZE 
BUT IN THE SUNSHINE FOURTEEN CELSIUS NOT 
TOO BAD TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST AND 
THROUGH SOUTHERN PARTS OF WALES WE 
WILL HOLD ON TO THE CLOUD AND STILL 
THE RAIN LINGERING AND STILL THE 
CHANCE OF THE ODD HEAVIER BURST 
NORTH WALES SHOULD STAY DRY AND 
BRIGHT BRIGHT DURING THIS EVENING THE RAIN IN 
THE SOUTH WEST AND SOUTH WALES WILL 
CLEAR AWAY WE SHOULD ALL HAVE A 
DRY NIGHT THEN AND IT WILL TURN 
MISTY IN ONE OR SWO SPOTS THE WIND 
LIGHTER THAN RECENT NIGHTS 
BUT TEMPERATURES NOT DROPPING TOO 
MUCH MUCH INTO THE MORNING AND TUESDAY IS 
LOOKING FINE DAY IT SHOULD BE 
DRY FOR THE BULK OF THE DAY JUST 
THE FAR WEST OF SCOTLAND SEEING 
RAIN LATER ON AND IT WILL START TO 
FEEL WARMER TEMPERATURES CLIMBING 
UP TO SEVENTEEN CELSIUS 
IN THE SUNNIER MOMENTS IT WILL 
FEEL SIMILARLY WARM 
DECLAN IS GOING TO TALK TO US ABOUT 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND LIFE LINES 
AND MORTGAGES AND STUFF 
YES AND THIS FIFTY BILLION LIFELINE 
THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS GOING 
TO GIVE TO THE HIGH STREET BANKS 
WE ARE EXPECTING THE DETAILS ON 
THAT LATER TODAY THIS IS ALL ABOUT 
GETTING THE BANKS TO LEND MONEY TO 
EACH OTHER ONCE AGAIN THAT FLOW OF 
MONEY IS ESSENTIAL FOR OUR 
MORTGAGES OUR CREDIT CARDS AND OUR 
OVERDRAFTS IT IS HOW THE BANKS GET 
THE MONEY THAT THEY THEN LEND ON TO 
US US NOW THE BANKS USE MORTGAGE DEBTS ON 
THEIR BOOKS AS A GUARANTEE FOR 
THEIR LOANS NOW IT IS THEIR 
PROMISE TO THE BANK THAT'S LENDING 
THE CASH THAT IT WILL GET ITS MONEY 
BACK BECAUSE OF AMERICA'S MORTGAGE 
CRISIS THE BANKS DON'T KNOW HOW 
MUCH THE MORTGAGE DEBT IS REALLY 
WORTH AND THAT UNCERTAINTY HAS LED 
TO A SQUEEZE ON LENDING THAT KEPT 
BORROWING COSTS HIGH THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND'S SOLUTION IS THAT THE HIGH 
STREET BANKS WILL BE ABLE TO SWAP 
THEIR MORTGAGE DEBT FOR SECURE 
GOVERNMENT LOANS SO INSTEAD OF 
USING MORTGAGES OF UNCERTAIN VALUE 
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO USE GOVERNMENT 
BACKED LOANS WITH A FIXED PRICE AS 
GUARANTEE FOR THEIR OWN BORROWING 
THE THEORY IS THAT REMOVES 
UNCERTAINTY AND SHOULD BRING 
BORROWING COSTS DOWN AGAIN THERE 
IS A RISK TO US AS TAXPAYERS 
BECAUSE WE WILL IS THAT UNCERTAIN 
MORTGAGE DEBT ON OUR HANDS THE 
CHANCELLOR SAYS HE WILL MAKE SURE 
THAT THAT RISK IS MINIMISED AND 
THAT THE BANKS WON BE ABLE TO GET 
THE GOVERNMENT BACKED LOANS AT FULL 
PRICE BUT CRITICS SAY TAXPAYERS 
REMAIN EXPOSED VINCE CABLE FROM 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS YESTERDAY 
SAID THAT THIS SCHEME WILL ALLOW 
THE BANKS TO PRIVATISE THEIR 
PROFITS BUT NATIONALISE THEIR 
LOSSES LOSSES DECLAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
MORE FROM DECLAN LATER IF YOU HAVE 
JUST EATEN YOUR BREAKFAST TOAST AND 
IT HAS BEEN SPREAD WITH HONEY WATCH 
OUT BECAUSE IT MIGHT NOT BE THERE 
FOR MUCH LONGER 
WE ARE ABOUT TO STING YOU WORRYING 
NEWS BRITAIN'S HONEYBEES COULD DIE 
OUT IN TEN YEARS AND IT WON'T JUST 
BE YOUR BREAKFAST THAT'S SORTED OUT 
BY THAT HERE IS RICHARD WESTCOTT 
WITH BEES 
GOOD MORNING 
IT IS NOT JUST THE HONEY THAT'S SO 
IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS STORY AND 
MADE ME SIT UP AND LISTEN I 
DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT BEFORE A 
THIRD OF THE FOOD WE EAT HAS BEEN 
POLLINATED BY A HONEYBEE BEES 
DON'T LIKE COMING OUT AT THIS TIME 
OF MORNING WE PUT A LIFE CAM IN 
THE HIVE PETE IS GOING TO SMOKE 
THEM UP A BIT LET'S SEE WHAT THEY 
ARE UP TO 
COLIN'S HIVE SHOULD BE BE BUZZING 
WITH ACTIVITY AND DRIPPING WITH 
NECTAR NECTAR THEY'RE ALL DEAD 
THEY'RE ALL DEAD 
THE ONLY BEES LEFT BEHIND ARE 
ROBBERS FROM OTHER COLONIES WATCH 
HER STEEL STEAL THE LAST OF THE 
FOOD FOOD WHAT IS CONCERNING IS WHATEVER 
VIRUSES ARE PREVALENT HERE COULD BE 
IN THESE TWO HIVES 
BEEKEEPERS EXPECT SOME LOSSES OVER 
THE WINTER BUT LAST YEAR ONE IN 
FIVE HIVES FAILED THEY WORRY THIS 
YEAR WILL BE THE SAME EXPERTS LIKE 
CHRIS PAINTS GRIM PICTURE 
WE COULD BE LOOKING AT THE 
EXTINCTION OF HONEYBEES IN THE U. K. 
IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS WHAT 
HAPPENED ALREADY MANAGED COLONIES 
ARE DECLINING WE KNOW THAT THE 
NUMBER OF WILD COLONIES IS ALMOST 
DROPPED TO ZERO AND I FEAR THAT WE 
ARE ON THE EDGE OF SOMETHING THAT 
WON'T BECOME APPARENT UNTIL THE 
CONSEQUENCES BECOME IRREVERSIBLE 
THAT'S WHY THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT 
TO SPEND EIGHT MILLION MILLION FINDING 
OUT WHAT'S KILLING THEM WHY ARE 
HONEYBEES IMPORTANT 
LOCK AROUND YOUR KITCHEN AND 
BATHROOM SO MANY THINGS RELY ON 
HONEYBEES SUPER FOODS LIKE BROCK 
COLLIE AND BLUEBERRIES KIWI FRUIT 
AND ALMONDS AND COTTON AND ONIONS 
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT HONEYBEES PLAY 
A PART IN THIRD OF THE THINGS WE EAT EAT BUT SOMETHING ELSE WORRYING 
BEEKEEPERS COLONY COLLAPSE 
DISORDER HAS RAVAGED HIVES IN 
AMERICA YET NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S 
CAUSING IT OR WHETHER IT WILL END 
UP HERE THE U. S. GOVERNMENT IS 
SPENDING MILLIONS ON RESEARCH 
HAAGEN DAZS CHIPPED IN SAYING 
AROUND HALF ITS FLAVOURS WOULDN'T 
MAKE IT INTO THE TUBS WITHOUT THE 
HONEYBEE HONEYBEE HOW WORRIED ARE YOU ABOUT WHAT'S 
HAPPENING IN AMERICA 
WE ARE VERY 
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN 
AMERICA BECAUSE IT IS VERY POSSIBLE 
THAT IT COULD BE TRANSLATE INTO THE 
U. K. THE BEES ARE THE SAME MANY OF 
THE BEE KEEPING PRACTISES ARE THE 
SAME SAME BEEKEEPERS CLAIM IF WE LOSE THIS 
VITAL LINK IN THE FOOD CHAIN OUR 
MOST EFFICIENT POLLINATOR WILL NEED 
MORE IMPORTS AND FOOD PRICES COULD 
SOAR 
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THAT IS IN A 
SECOND YOU WILL NEVER GUESS 
DOCTOR OSBORNE WILL BE ONE OF THE 
PEOPLE WHO COULD BE CONDUCTING 
RESEARCH TEN YEARS ALL THE BEES 
GONE IT SOUNDS DRAMATIC IS IT 
REALLY THAT SERIOUS THAT'S THAT'S DRAMATIC IT IS REALLY THE 
BEEKEEPERS WHO KNOW HOW WELL ARE 
BADLY THEIR BEES ARE DOING WE NEED 
TO DO MORE RESEARCH IF WE CAN FIND 
SOLUTIONS FOR THE BEEKEEPERS FOR 
THE PROBLEMS THEY ARE FACING 
WHAT ABOUT THE PROBLEM IN AMERICA 
THAT HASN'T HIT HERE YET 
THEY SEEM 
TO HAVE THIS COLONY COLLAPSE 
DISORDER WHICH IS MAKING A 
DIFFERENCE TO THE MIGRATORY BEE 
COLONIES WE DON'T THINK THAT 
DISORDER IS HERE BUT IT IS NOT 
CLEAR WHAT'S CAUSING THAT PROBLEM 
IT IS PROBABLY A VARIETY OF THINGS 
SUCH AS DISEASE LACK OF GOOD IN 
THE ENVIRONMENT BUT AS FAR AS WE 
KNOW IT ISN'T HERE HERE YET 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I WILL GIVE YOU QUICK UP TO DATE 
ON WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAID THEY 
SAID THEY SPEND ONE POINT THREE MILLION ON 
THEIR BEE SQUAD THAT CHECKS ON 
BRITAIN'S BEES 
THAT IS A BEE TRANSMITTER 
THEY TIE IT ON TO THE BEE'S BODY 
AND THEY CAN FOLLOW THE BEE AROUND 
ON A LITTLE RADAR SCREEN 
I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH BEE CAM AS 
WELL WELL HOW DO THEY STICK IT ON THE 
BEE BEE HOW DO YOU STICK IT ON THE BEE 
A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE 
AND SOME SURGEON'S FINGERS 
A VERY TRICKY JOB

GOOD MORNING WELCOME IF YOU HAVE 
JUST JOINED US THIS IS BREAKFAST 
OUR MAIN STORY THIS MORNING THE 
CONSERVATIVES SAY MILLIONS OF 
POUNDS ARE BEING WASTED ON A SCHEME 
TO COMBAT PASSPORT FRAUD FACE TO 
FACE INTERVIEWS FOR ALL NEW 
APPLICANTS WERE ANNOUNCED LAST 
APRIL AS PART OF A CRACKDOWN ON 
FRAUD BUT B. B. C. BREAKFAST HAS 
LEARNED THAT ALTHOUGH NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED NONE HAS BEEN 
TURNED DOWN KEITH DOYLE IS AT THE 
IDENTITY AND PASSPORT SERVICE IN 
LONDON I CAN SEE PEOPLE QUEUING 
BEHIND YOU BUT DOES THIS MEAN THAT 
THE SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING AS IT 
SHOULD 
WELL THE IDENTITY AND SHOULD PASSPORT SERVICE PEOPLE SAY THE 
SYSTEM IS WORKING EXACTLY AS IT 
SHOULD LAST YEAR THEY WERE SAYING 
THAT TEN THOUSAND FRAUDULENT PASSPORTS 
WERE ISSUED BASED ON FRAUDULENT 
APPLICATIONS SO THEY SAY THAT THE 
BEST WAY TO COMBAT THIS IS TO SET 
UP THE CENTRES AND MAKE FACE TO 
FACE INTERVIEWS BECAUSE THEY'RE 
SAYING THAT ANYONE WANTING TO MAKE 
A FRAUDULENT APPLICATION WOULD BE 
DETERED BY GOING TO AN INTERVIEW 
BUT IT HAS PUT A COST OF TWELVE POINT FIVE OH ON 
TO EVERY APPLICATION FOR A PASSPORT 
AND SOME ARE SAYING THAT CRIMINALS 
WILL LOOK ELSEWHERE AND BUY ONE ON 
THE BLACK MARKET FOR FIVE HUNDRED SO THE 
ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE INCONVENIENCED 
ARE THE PEOPLE WITH NOTHING TO HIDE 
AND WHO HAVE TO PAY EXTRA AND GO 
FOR THE INTERVIEWS

MANY MOONS AGO WHEN I HAD ONE CHIN 
I WAS QUITE GOOD I'M I'M HOPEFULLY WE'LL BRING YOU PICTURES 
OF THE PINK BALL IN ACTION 
HE COULD EAT HIS WAY THROUGH AN 
ENTIRE MENU AT HIS FAVOURITE 
RESTAURANT JOHN PRESCOTT HAS 
REVEALED HE HAS SUFFERED FROM AN 
EATING DISORDER BULIMIA AND HE IS 
NOW URGING PEOPLE TO GET HELP 
RATHER THAN SUFFER IN SILENCE AS 
HE DID AND LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
SURPRISED BY HIS ADMISSION SO HOW 
COMMON IS IT AMONGST MEN WE ARE 
SNOW NOW JOINED BY PHILIPPE JACQUET 
WHO WAS SUFFER SUFFERER FROM ELEVEN 
AND NOW RUNS HIS OWN CLINIC TO HELP 
OTHERS AND AMANDA HILLS FROM THE 
NATIONAL CENTRE FOR EATING DSORDERS 
PHILIPPE HOW DID IT START 
SINCE I 
REMEMBER MY RELATIONSHIP WITH FOOD 
WAS VERY STRANGE SINCE I WAS VERY 
YOUNG I FOCUSED ON MY WEIGHT AND 
SHAPE AND NOW LOOKING BACKWARD I 
CAN SEE HOW I WAS EAT ING TO ANEETH 
SIZE MY FEELINGS 
AND HOW MUCH WERE 
YOU EATING WHAT WERE YOU BINGEING 
ON 
GENERALLY IT WAS SUGARY THINGS ON BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING WITH 
BULIMIA IS THAT OFTEN PEOPLE SEE 
THE BINGEING OR THE PURGING BUT 
ALSO WHAT IS REALLY PAINFUL WHAT 
WAS REALLY PAINFUL FOR ME WAS THE 
OBSESSION A TWENTY FOUR HOUR SEVEN IN MY 
HEAD WHERE THERE WAS THE URGE TO 
EAT A LOT BUT ALSO THE OBSESSION 
TO BECOME SLIMMER AND THIS WAS 
REALLY THE PAIN 
JOHN PRESCOTT'S 
ADMISSION SHEDS A LIGHT ON 
SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE OF 
WHICH IS MEN SUFFERING FROM BULIMIA 
HOW OFTEN IS IT HAPPENING 
ABSOLUTELY IT IS PERCEIVED AS NOT 
BEING VERY COMMON AND IT IS THOUGHT 
THE STATISTICS ARE ONE IN TEN 
SEVERERERS ARE MEN AND IT IS 
MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS WHERE 
SOMEBODY IS PERCEIVED TO BE IN 
COMPLETE CONTROL ON THE SURFACE 
AND UNDERNEATH THEY'RE FRANK 
PARTICULARCALLY PADDLING AND 
THEY'RE IN SITUATION WHERE THEY 
FEEL THEY CAN'T COPE OR THERE IS 
SITUATION BEYOND STRESSFUL AND I 
THINK MR. PRESCOTT SAID THAT WAS THE 
CASE FOR HIM IT WAS STRESS WHAT WHAT ARE THE OUTWARD VISIBLE SYMPTOMS 
I 
FOR SOMEBODY WHO WORKS WITH I CLIENTS LIKE I DO THE FACT THAT 
HE HAS A VERY SWOLLEN FACE AND THE 
ACT OF VOMITING A LOT HAS AN EFFECT 
ON YOUR ELECT LIGHT LEVELS AND ALL 
YOUR CHEMICAL IMBALANCES WHICH 
BECOME EXTREMELY BAD 
EELECTROLIGHT LEVELS AND ALSO THE 
ACT OF VOMITING BECOMES ADDICTIVE 
DOES IT WHAT WERE YOUR FEELINGS 
WHEN YOU WENT IN FOR THE BINGEING 
RELIEF DISGUST WHAT WERE YOU 
FEELING 
I SUPPOSE I FOUND THAT IN FEELING THE BEGINNING PEOPLE START TO BINGE 
TO ANAESTHETISE THEIR FEELINGS AND 
THEN THEY BINGE TO PREVENT THE 
PURGING BECAUSE WHEN YOU PURGE 
THERE IS A SENSE OF RELIEF AND 
GUILT ABOUT IT AND THERE IS A 
CHEMICAL RELEASE IN THE BRAIN TO 
GIVE AN INNER SENSE OF CALM L. HOW HOW DO YOU TREAT IT 
IT IS VERY 
TREATABLE AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT 
MESSAGE TO GET ACROSS IT IS GREAT 
THAT MR. PRESCOTT HAS SAID SOMETHING 
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE STRUGGLE 
WITH IT AND THERE IS A PARTICULAR 
STIGMA ATTACHED TO MEN SUFFERING 
FROM IT IT IS PARTICULARLY THOUGHT 
TO BE A CONDITION OF WOMEN 
COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR HELPS AND 
COUNSELLING BUT IT MORE ABOUT THE 
HABIT OF CHANGE AND BUILDING SELF 
ESTEEM OFTEN PEOPLE ARE LACKING IN 
CONFIDENCE ALTHOUGH THEY'RE IN A 
POSITION OF POWER UNDERNEATH THEY 
FEEL THEY ARE NOT WORTHY OF THAT 
POSITION THAT IS OFTEN THE CASE 
YOU WERE SUFFERING AT THE AGE OF TWELVE 
WHEN DID YOU DECIDE TO GET HELP OR 
CHANGE WHAT YOU WERE DOING DID 
ANYONE SPOT IT AND FIND OUT WHAT 
WAS GOING ON 
NO AS AMANDA SAID 
IT IS A VERY SECRETIVE DISEASE 
WHICH MEANS THERE IS A LOT OF SHAME 
INVOLVED AND I HID IT VERY WELL L. 
SAW IT AS A SOLUTION TO AN INNER 
STRUGGLE AND I SUPPOSE I STOPPED 
WHEN THE SOLUTION DIDN'T WORK AND I 
WANTED TO SOLVE IT AS A WAY AND I 
STARTED TO ASK FOR HELP 
AND BEING 
BULIMIC DOES NOT MAKE YOU THIN NO NO IN FACT IT CAUSES YOU TO GAB 
WEIGHT 
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY A WEIGHT WORD TO PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM 
BULIMIA THERE IS A LIFE BETWEEN 
THE MEAL LIFE IS NOT A BIG MEAL 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN 
TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO ADMIT IT WE REALLY 
APPRECIATE IT 
B. B. C. BREAKFAST LEARNED THAT NOT A 
SINGLE PASSPORT APPLICANT HAS BEEN 
TURNED DOWN AS RESULT OF BEING INTERVIEWED INTERVIEWED THOUSANDS OF LIVES COULD BE SAVED 
IF THE N. H. S. MADE GREATER USE OF A 
NEW DRUG TREATMENT FOR BLOOD CLOTS 
CRACKING DOWN ON DANGEROUS DRIVING 
MIKE CARTWRIGHT IS ON THE A ELEVEN IN 
NORFOLK NORFOLK THE POLICE CAMERAS ARE OUT THIS 
MORNING BUT THIS CRACKDOWN IS NOT 
JUST HAPPENING HERE IT IS 
HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IT 
IS HAPPENING RIGHT ACROSS EUROPE 
TIME NOW FOR THE WEATHER 
MATT HAS GOT IT FOR US AND IT IS 
GOING 
GOING TO GET WARM 
IT IS GOING TO GET WARMER THAN LAST 
WEEK YOU CAN'T GETAWAY FROM THE 
CHILL THAT WAS IN THE AIR LAST WEEK 
BUT ASTED WINDS EASE DOWN WE WILL 
START TO SEE THE TEMPERATURES RISE 
YOU WILL START TO SEE THAT TREND 
LATER TODAY AND INTO TOMORROW TO 
BEGIN WITH IT IS GREY OUT THERE A 
LOT OF CLOUD AROUND MOST OF US 
START DRY BUT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
MOST COUNTIES OF ENGLAND WE HAVE 
SEEN RAIN PUSHING THROUGH THE 
ENGLISH CHANNEL AND IT IS WET 
START FOR SOUTHERNMOST COUNTIES 
THIS IS WHERE THE WET WEATHER WILL 
BE REALLY SOUTH OF THE THAMES 
ESTUARY SOME HEAVY BURSTS OF RAIN 
STILL THAT EAST TO NORTH EASTERLY 
WIND MAKING IT FEEL ON THE CHILLY 
CHILLY SIDE NORTH OF THAT IT IS 
DRY AND WE WILL START TO SEE 
SUNNIER MOMENTS DEVELOP ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND THERE WILL BE 
SUNSHINE INTO THE AFTERNOON ALWAYS 
MORE CLOUD THAN DURING YESTERDAY 
BUT IN THE SUNNIER MOMENTS 
TEMPERATURES UP TO TWELVE CELSIUS IN 
BELFAST BELFAST MORE CLOUD THAN SUNSHINE IN BELFAST 
BUT THE WIND WILL HAVE EASED SO IT 
WILL FEEL LESS COLD NORTH WEST 
ENGLAND GENERALLY CLOUDY DURING 
THE SECOND SECOND HALF OF THE DAY 
BUT BRIGHTENING UP NICELY TO A 
FAIRLY LOVELY AFTERNOON ACROSS MANY 
EASTERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND IT 
WILL FEEL CHILLY ALONG THE NORTH 
SEA COASTS WE WILL HOLD ON TO THE 
CLOUD OUTBREAKS OF RAIN THROUGHOUT 
THE DAY NORTH WALES SHOULD STAY 
DRY AND BRIGHT 
THE RAIN IN WALES AND THE SOUTH 
WEST WILL START TO FIZZLE OUT THIS 
EVENING AND FROM THEN ON IT SHOULD 
BE DRY FOR MOST OF US THROUGHOUT 
THE NIGHT WE WILL HAVE WINDS 
FALLING LIGHTER THAN RECENT NIGHTS 
SO THERE COULD BE A FEW MIST AND 
AND FOG PATCHES FORM BUT IT SHOULD 
BE FROST FREE TEMPERATURES FIVE TO EIGHT 
CELSIUS CELSIUS INTO TUESDAY IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL 
BE THE DRIEST BRIGHTEST DAY OF THE 
WEEK SPELLS OF SUNSHINE FOR JUST 
ABOUT ALL OF US A PLEASANT DAY AND 
WITH WINDS LIGHTER AND THE SUNSHINE 
PRESENT TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
HIGHER THAN AROUND LATE 
DECLAN HAS MORE ON THE GOVERNMENT 
PLANS TO GET THE MORTGAGE MARKET 
MOVING AGAIN 
THIS IS THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND WHICH IS EXPECTED TO THROW 
A FIFTY BILLION LIFELINE TO THE HIGH 
STREET BANKS THE PLAN WOULD 
ENCOURAGE HIGH STREET BANKS TO LEND 
MONEY TO EACH OTHER GIVING THEM 
STRONGER GUARANTEES THAT THEY WILL 
GET THEIR LOANS BACK THAT WILL 
REDUCE THE FEAR OF LENDING AND WILL 
BRING DOWN THE THE COSTS OF OUR 
MORTGAGES CREDIT CARDS AND 
OVERDRAFTS NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON 
YOU MIGHT THINK FOR COLIN AND MANDY 
TAYLOR THEIR CHEAP MORTGAGE DEAL 
RAN OUT TWO MONTHS AGO AND THEY 
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND A NEW 
CHEAP DEAL SO THEY ARE PAYING MORE 
THAN THEY CAN AFFORD 
IT IS APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY A MONTH 
MORE 
THAT'S JUST THE MORTGAGE MORE JUST THE MORTGAGE 
THAT'S NOT INCLUDING EVERY OTHER 
BILL THAT WE HAVE HAS GONE UP 
SO WE NOW ACTUALLY WE ARE GOING TO 
BE LIVING ON AN OVERDRAFT IF WE ARE 
NOT CAREFUL WHEN WE STARTED 
LOOKING FOR NEW MORTGAGE WE WERE 
NOTICING THAT FIXED RATE THEY JUST 
DIDN'T APPEAR IT WAS ALMOST AS IF 
THE BANKS KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING 
GOING WRONG AND THEY STARTED 
PULLING THE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES 
AWAY AWAY I AM STRESSED I'M MORE THAN 
STRESSED IT IS JUST I KEEP 
THINKING THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING 
YOU KNOW YOU ALMOST WANT TO HAND 
BACK THE KEYS TO THE HOUSE WHICH WE 
HAVE LIVED IN NOW SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE 
THAT'S COLIN AND MANDY TAYLOR WITH 
ME IS SUE ANDERSON FROM THE COUNCIL 
OF MORTGAGE LENDERS THE WAY THIS 
IS MEANT TO WORK IS THE BANKS USE 
MORTGAGE DEBTS ON THEIR BOOKS AS 
GUARANTEES FOR THE LOANS THEY MAKE 
THEMSELVES AND THEY CAN SWAP THAT 
FOR GOVERNMENT DEBTS THAT HAVE 
MORE CERTAIN VALUE WILL IT WORK 
IT IS A GOOD START AND WE HOPE IT 
WILL WORK BUT IT IS PREDICATED ON 
A FEW THINGS HAVING TO HAPPEN WE 
NEED TO SEE THE PRICE THAT THEY ARE 
GOING TO GET THE SWAPS FOR AND THEN 
WE NEED TO SEE THE PRICE WHICH THEY 
CAN USE THE BONDS TO RAISE MONEY 
FROM OTHER SOURCES AND THEN WE HAVE 
GOT TO SEE THAT TRICKLING DOWN TO 
THE ACTUAL LENDING THAT THEY DO 
QUITE A FEW STEPS INVOLVED IN THE 
THE PROCESS 
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THIS 
WILL LEAD TO REDUCTION IN 
MORTGAGE COSTS FOR THE THE OF US 
ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO GUARANTEE IT 
IS A NECESSARY STEP IT IS THE KIND 
OF THING WE HAVE BEEN HOPING TO SEE 
WHETHER IT IS ENOUGH WE WILL HAVE 
TO WAIT AND SEE WE MAY NEED TO 
LOOK AT OTHER MEASURES AS WELL BUT 
IT HELPS 
THIS IS A QUESTION WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT FIFTY BILLION WHICH TO YOU AND 
ME IS BIG SUM OF MONEY BUT IN 
TERMS OF HOW MUCH MONEY WE BORROW 
IN MORTGAGES EVERY YEAR IT IS 
SMALL BEER 
LAST YEAR WE LENT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY BILLION IN 
MORTGAGES ABOUT ONE HUNDRED BILLION OF 
NET LENDING IT IS ONLY HALF THAT 
NET LENDING LEVEL OF LAST YEAR 
IT IS SHORT CHANGE IT IS NOT SHORT 
CHANGE AND I THINK WE SHOULDN'T 
UNDER ESTIMATE AND SNEEZE AT FIFTY 
BILLION IT IS A GOOD START LET'S 
HOPE IT HAS THE DESIRED EFFECT 
ON THE FRONT OF THE TIMES NEWSPAPER 
THIS MORNING IT SAYS THAT TRESH 
ESOURCES ARE TREASURY SOURCES ARE 
INDICATING THAT THE OFFER FROM THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND MAY HAVE TO RISE TO 
ONE HUNDRED BILLION 
LET'S WAIT AND SEE 
WHAT THE CHANCELLOR TELLS US AND 
WHAT BANK TELLS US LATER ON IT IS 
HELPFUL TO SEE THIS CHANGE OF 
ATTITUDE THIS WILLINGNESS TO 
INTERVENE WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN 
LOOKING FOR 
WE WILL KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR ANY 
NEWS ON THE BANK OF ENGLAND WE ARE 
GETTING SOME CONFLICTING 
INFORMATION SOME SOURCES ARE 
SUGGESTING WE MIGHT GET AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT THIS MORNING LOOKING 
AT THE LATEST WORDS FROM ROBERT 
PESTON THE SUGGESTION IS WE MAY 
NOT GET THIS UNTIL THE END OF THE 
WEEK WE WILL KEEP OUR EYES PEELED 
IF YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION

THE ONLY PLACE TO START MORE AFTER 
EIGHT ZERO ZERO A M. EIGHT HUNDRED A M. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

THIS IS BREAKFAST ONE OF THE 
GRATEST U. TURNS IN ITS THREE HUNDRED YEAR 
HISTORY THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S FIFTY 
BILLION LIFES WILLLINE FOR 
STRUGGLING BANKS LIFELINE 
GOOD MORNING IT'S MONDAY THE TWENTY FIRST 
OF APRIL GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
PASSPORT FRAUD NEARLY NINETY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE ARE INTERVIEWED AT NEW 
MULTI MILLION POUND CENTRESING BUT 
NOT ONE PERSON IS TURNED DOWN 
THOUSANDS DIE FROM BLOOD CLOTS NOW 
A NEW DRUG COULD REDUCE THE RISK 
FROM HOSPITAL OPERATIONS WE HAVE 
THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER DAVID 
CAMERON JOINING US SHORTLY WE 
HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM YOU 
KEEP THEM COMING IN WE WILL PUT 
THEM TO HIM HONEY BEES ARE A VITE 
L. LINK IN THE FOOD CHAIN THEY HELP 
POLLINATE AROUND A THIRD OF THE 
FOOD WE EAT WE WILL HAVE MORE ON 
THAT LIVE IN TWENTY MINUTES 
LATER IN THE PROGRAMME 
BAFFY WHAFF 
BAFY WHAFY WIM W. A. M. THAT MEANS I 
HAVE JUST WON AN AWARD AND THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH 
HARRY HILL WINS AN AWARD IN A NIGHT 
TO REMEMBER AT THE BAF TASS 
BAFTAS THE BANK OF ENGLAND COULD 
THROW A LIFELINE TO BANKS 
STRUGGLING WITH THE IMPACT OF THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH PLAN IS TO ALLOW THE 
BANKS TO SWAP THEIR DEBT FOR SAFE 
GOVERNMENT BONDS BACKED BY THE 
TAXPAYER YOU WERE DESCRIBING THIS 
AS THE BIGGEST U. TURN IN THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND'S THREE HUNDRED YEAR HISTORY IT'S 
QUITE A TURNAROUND WHEN THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH STARTED IN THE SUMMER OF 
LAST YEAR THE BANK OF ENGLAND WAS 
TALKING ABOUT MORAL HAZARD IT SAID 
IF HIGH STREET BANKS HAD MADE SILLY 
DECISIONS THEY SHOULD LIVE BY THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF IT NOW A NEW PLAN 
THAT IS DESIGNED TO GET THE BANKS 
TO LEND MONEY TO EACH OTHER ONCE 
AGAIN AT FLOW OF MONEY THAT IS 
ESSENTIAL FOR OUR MORTGAGE 
OVERDRAFTS AND CREDIT CARDS IT'S 
HOW THE BANKS GET THE MONEY WHICH 
THEY THEN LEND ON TO US TO GET 
THIS MONEY TO BORROW THIS MONEY 
FROM OTHER BANKS THE BANKS USE THE 
MORTGAGE DEBT ON THEIR OWN BOOKS A 
GUARANTEE FOR THEIR LOANS IT'S 
THEIR PROMISE TO THE BANK LENDING 
MONEY THAT THEY WILL GET THEIR CASH 
BACK BECAUSE OF AMERICA'S MORTGAGE 
CRISIS THE BANKS DON'T KNOW HOW 
MUCH THIS MORTGAGE DEBT IS ACTUALLY 
WORTH THAT UNCERTAINTY HAS LED TO 
A SQUEEZE ON LENDERSING AND PUSHED 
UP THE COST OF BORROWING TO US THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND'S SOLUTION WHICH WE 
EXPECT TO BE ANNOUNCED WITHIN THE 
NEXT HOUR IS THAT HIGH STREET BANKS 
WILL BE ABLE TO SWAP THAT DODGY 
MORTGAGE DEBT FOR ROCK SOLID 
GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT SO INSTEAD 
OF USING MORTGAGES OF UNCERTAIN 
VALUE THEY WOULD HAVE GOVERNMENT 
BONDS OF A FIXED PRICE AS 
GUARANTEES THE THEORY IS THAT 
WOULD REMOVE THE UNCERTAINTY AND 
SHOULD BRING DOWN THE COST OF 
BORROWING MONEY BUT THERE IS A 
RISK TO THE TAXPAYER IN ALL OF THIS 
BECAUSE WE END UP WITH THAT DODGY 
MORTGAGE DEBT ON OUR HANDS THE 
CHANCELLOR SAYS HE WILL MAKE SURE 
THAT THE RISK IS MINIMISED BUT 
CRITICS SAY TAXPAYERS REMAIN 
EXPOSED ONE CHARGE FROM THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS TODAY FROM VINCE 
CABLE IS THAT THIS SCHEME ALLOWS 
THE BANKS TO PRIVATISE THEIR 
PROFITS BUT NATIONALISE THEIR 
LOSSES 
THAT ISING AND WE WILL BE PUTTING 
TO THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER 
SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE PUTTING 
TO THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER DAVID 
CAMERON M. P.'S RETURN TO WESTMINSTER 
TODAY FOLLOWING THE EASTER BREAK 
THE ROW IS STILL RAGING OVER GORDON 
BROWN'S DECISION TO END THE TEN 
PENCE RATE OF INCOME TAX MINISTERS 
ARE FIGHTING TO HEAD OFF A 
REBELLION BY SEVENTY LABOUR BACKBENCHERS 
WHO WANT COMPENSATION FOR THE FIVE 
MILLION PEOPLE ESTIMATED TO HAVE 
LOST OUT THEY WERE UNVEILED LAST 
YEAR AS MAJOR CRACKDOWN ON PASSPORT 
FRAUD A MULTI MILLION POUND CENTRE 
WHERE ALL APLICANTS WOULD HAVE TO 
ATTEND A FACE TO FACE INTERVIEW 
NOW A YEAR ON NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN INTERVIEWED AND NOT A SINGLE 
ONE HAS BEEN TURNED DOWN 
CRITICS SAY IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY 
BREAKFAST'S KEITH DOYLE IS AT THE 
IDENTITY SKA PASSPORT SERVICE 
HEADQUARTERS HEADQUARTERS THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY STREAM OF 
PEOPLE COMING HERE LAST YEAR IT 
ESTIMATES IT USUALED AROUND ZERO 
PASSPORT THAT WERE TEN THOUSAND 
PASSPORTS THAT WERE FRAUDULENT 
THEY SAY THE ONLY WAY TO BAT THIS 
IS TO HAVE FACE TO FACE INTERVIEWS 
PEOPLE HAVE TO GET A TWENTY MINUTE 
INTERVIEW THAT THEY HAVE TO PROVE 
THAT THEY ARE WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE 
FALSE IDENTITIES HAVE BEEN A 
TERRORIST WEAPON LAST YEAR DHIREN 
BAROT WAS JAILED FOR LIFE FOR 
PLOTTING A SPATE OF BOMB ATTACKS IN 
BRITAIN HE HAD NUMEROUS PASSPORT 
SOME WITH FRAUDULENT IDENTITIES 
IT'S BELIEVED TEN THOUSAND FRAUDULENT 
PASSPORTS WERE ISSUED LAST YEAR 
HALF OF THEM CAME FROM FIRST TIME 
APPLICATIONS CAN YOU CONFIRM YOUR 
FULL NAME 
IT'S LES SMITH 
A YEAR 
AGO THE PASSPORT SERVICE PROMISED 
IT WOULD INTERVIEW EVERY ADULT 
APPLYING FOR A PASSPORT FOR THE 
FIRST TIME TO STOP FRAUDULENT 
APPLICANTS AFTER SPENDING TENS OF 
MILLIONS ON A CENTRE LIKE THIS 
OVER NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
INTERVIEWED BUT NOT ONE HAS BEEN 
TURNED DOWN THEY SAY IT'S NOT 
SIGN OF FAILURE 
I AM SATISFIED 
THIS IS A SATISFACTORY L. AM 
SATISFIED THAT THROUGH FRAUD 
PREVENTION IT'S A DETERRENT PLUS 
THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO ATTEMPT TO 
APPLY AND ARE DETERRED BY THE 
PROCESS OF ASKING FOR MORE 
INFORMATION BEFORE THEY COME FOR 
INTERVIEW FINALLY SOME COME FOR 
INTERVIEW AND SOME OF THE CASES GET 
REFERRED TO THE FRAUD UNIT THE THE COST OF A PASSPORT HAS RISEN 
SHARPLY JUST THREE YEARS AGO THEY 
COST FORTY TWO NOW IT'S SEVENTY TWO TWELVE POINT FIVE OH OF 
THAT GOES TO THE NEW APPLICATION 
STFR 
SERVICE STFR EVERY HARDENED CRIMINAL ARE NOT 
GOING THIS ROUTE THEY WILL BE 
DOING OTHER WAYS WHAT THIS IS 
DOING IS HOT JUST INCONVENIENCEED 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT 
BRITISH CITIZEN IT'S ALSO COSTING 
THEM TWELVE POINT FIVE OH A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF 
THE COST OF A PASSPORT IS GOING ON 
THE INTERVIEWS WHICH ARE PROVING 
USELESS USELESS SECURITY EXPERTS SAY THE SYSTEM 
WILL BRING BENEFITS BUT THE 
DETERMINED WILL FIND WAYS AROUND IT 
THE CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS WILL 
FIND WAYS OF GETTING IN THERE TO 
GET THE PASSPORT THEY WANT THE 
PASSPORT IS ONLY AS GOOD AS WEAKEST 
PASSPORT OFFICE IN EUROPE 
ONLY ONE 
IN FIVE FIRST TIME ADULT APPLICANTS 
HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED SINCE THE 
SCHEME STARTED BUT BY THE END OF 
THE YEAR EVERY NEW AANT WILL FACE 
AN INTERVIEW IT WILL BE SOME TIME 
BEFORE WE KNOW IF IT'S HAD AN 
IMPACT 
THE IDENTITY AND PASS PORTS IMPACT SERVICE DOES ADMIT THAT CRIMINALS 
WILL BE LOOKING AT OTHER ROUTES TO 
GET THEIR PASSPORT WE KNOW THERE 
IS A HUGE BLACK MARKET IN FAKE AND 
FRAUDULENT PASSPORTS CAN YOU PICK 
ONE UP FOR FIVE HUNDRED WHAT THEY ARE 
SAYING IS AT LEAST THEY ARE MAKING 
THE APPLICATION PROCESS MORE ROBUST 
BUT THE BIG WORRY IS NOW THAT WITH 
THIS MULTI MILLION POUND CENTRE SET 
UP ACROSS THE COUNTRY TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE BEING 
FORCED TO GO TO INTERVIEW THE ONLY 
PEOPLE WHO END UP GOING TO 
INTERVIEWS IN CENTRES ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING 
TO HIDE 
THE N. H. S. IS BEING URGED TO 
MAKE GREATER USE OF A NEW TREATMENT 
TO PREVENT BLOOD CLOTS WHICH 
CAMPAIGNERS SAY COULD SAVE 
THOUSANDS OF LIVES EVERY YEAR SO 
FAR IT'S BEEN LICENSED ONLY FOR 
PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD NIP AND KNEE 
OPERATIONS HIP 
SHARON FRANKLIN HAS HAD TWO HIP 
REPLACEMENT OPERATIONS AFTER THE 
FIRST ONE SHE DEVELOP ADD BLOOD 
CLOT IN A VAIN IT'S VERY PAINFUL 
AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS BEFORE 
THE SECOND OPERATION SHARON HAD 
WEEKS OF BLOOD THINNING INJECTIONS 
TO PREVENT ANOTHER BLOOD CLOT FOR 
MY SECOND HIP OPERATION THEY GAVE 
ME COURSE OF HEPARIN INJECTIONS 
FOR SIX WEEKS THAT WAS LIKE HAVING 
A BEE STING DAILY THE PAIN WAS 
IMMENSE 
BLOOD CLOTS IN HOSPITAL IMMENSE PATIENTS ARE A SERIOUS PROBLEM 
THEY ARE THOUGHT TO CAUSE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
DEATHS IN ENGLAND EACH YEAR IT 
COSTS AROUND SIX HUNDRED FORTY MILLION A YEAR TO 
MANAGE THE HEALTH EFFECTS FIFTY PER CENT OF 
PATIENTS IN HIP REPLACEMENT 
OPERATIONS ARE AT RISK BUT THAT 
RISK CAN BE CUT DRAMATICALLY WITH 
BLOOD THINNING DRUGS BEFORE SURGERY 
UNTIL NOW PATIENTS HAVE HAD 
INJECTIONS WITH CONSTANT MONITORING 
BEFORE THEIR OPERATION IT'S HOPED 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PILL WILL GIVE 
DOCTORS ANOTHER OPTION 
THE TACT IS 
EASIER TO GIVE IT'S THE TABLET 
IS EASIER TO GIVE IT'S MUCH BETTER 
FOR THE NURSING STAFF AND PATIENTS 
WE HOPE IT WILL GIVE EXCITEMENT AND 
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GIVE BLOOD 
THINNERS THINNERS EACH YEAR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE 
SHARON HAVE OPERATIONS BETTER 
SCREENING AND PRESURGERY TREATMENT 
COULD AVOID THE PAIN SHE WENT 
THROUGH FROM A BLOOD CLOT THE 
POLICE UNIT SET UP TO COMBAT 
INTERNET CHILD SEX ABUSE IS 
REPORTING A BIG INCREASE IN ARRESTS 
THE CHILD EXPLOITICIAN AND 
PROTECTION CENTRE SAYS SINCE APRIL 
LAST YEAR IT'S ARRESTED THREE HUNDRED SEX

IS SIXTY ONE YEAR OLD PENSION WHO IS TWO HUNDRED 
WORSE OFF WHAT WOULD THEY DO TO 
HELP SOMEONE LIKE HER 
WE HAVE TO STOP THE GOVERNMENT IN 
ITS TRACKS FROM GOING AHEAD WITH 
THIS TAX RISE FROM HARD WORKING 
PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES WHAT WE 
DISCOVERED YESTERDAY IS THEY 
TARGETED FIFTY THREE MILLION THIS WASN'T 
AN ERROR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE 
GOING TO FACE THEM WITH A HIGHER 
TAX BILL WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO 
IS STOP THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS 
TRACKS ASK THEM TO THINK AGAIN AND 
THEN WORK WITH THEM L. HAVE SAID WE 
ARE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT AND TRY AND WORK OUT HOW 
BEST TO HELP THESE FIFTY THREE MILLION 
PEOPLE THE LOSERS FROM THIS BUDGET 
PERHAPS THROUGH CHANGING AN 
ALLOWANCE PERHAPS THROUGH TAX 
CREDITS U. WE WILL WORK WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT TO GET THIS RIGHT 
PEOPLE WANT SOME MORE CONCRETE 
SUGGESTIONS MARIA SAYS IS DAVID 
CAMERON GOING TO GIVE PLEDGE HE 
WOULD RESTORE THE TEN PENCE TAX 
RATE IS HE HAVING GREAT FUN WITH 
LABOUR BUT WOULD HE DO ANYTHING 
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT WHEN IT COMES TO THE NEXT ELECTION 
I WILL SET OUT BUT I CAN'T MAKE BUT THE PROMISE NOW L. DON'T 
KNOW WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE WILL BE I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL BE AND HOW MUCH 
MONEY THERE BE IN THE KITTY 
PROBABLY VERY LITTLE THE FIRST 
THING IS TO GET THE GOVERNMENT TO 
STOP AND THINK AGAIN ALISTAIR 
DARLING YESTERDAY SHOWED NO 
INCLINATION 
HE IS NOT GOING TO INCLINATION REWRITE THE BUDGET 
WHY NOT HE HE SAYS WE ARE GOING THROUGH A CREDIT 
CRUNCH THERE IS A ENORMOUS GLOBAL 
ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN THIS HAS SAVED 
THEM SEVEN BILLION A YEAR AND THAT HAS 
ALREADY BEEN ALLOCATED 
LET ME DEAL 
WITH THAT IN A MINUTE LET'S THINK 
OF THIS PLEDGE OF DARLING TARL 
SAYING I AM NOT GOING TO REWRITE 
THE BUDGET WHAT ARE WE VOTING IN 
PARLIAMENT FOR WHAT IS THE POINT 
OF THESE VOTES IF THEY CAN'T FORCE 
THE GOVERNMENT TO THINK AGAIN IF 
PARLIAMENT DOES VOTE FOR AN 
AMENDMENT THAT SAYS STOP THINK 
HELP THESE FIFTY THREE MILLION PEOPLE THE 
CHANCELLOR IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET 
BACK INTO THE TREASURY AND REWRITE 
THE BUDGET AND HELP THOSE PEOPLE 
THAT IS WHAT DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT 
THAT IS WHAT PARLIAMENT IS FOR L. 
THOUGHT HIS PERFORMANCE YESTERDAY 
WAS WRONG ON THE SEVEN BILLION IT 
WOULDN'T COST SEVEN BILLION TO HELP 
THE FIFTY THREE MILLION SEVEN BILLION WAS THE 
TOTAL COST OF ABOLISHING THE TEN 
PENCE STARTING RATE OF TAX IT'S IT'S THE MONEY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAVE 
RAZED BY DOING THIS WHICH HAS BEEN 
ALLOCATED 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIFTY THREE ALLOCATED MILLION PEOPLE AND HOW MUCH THEY 
HAVE LOST IT'S ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION 
SO A TOTALLY DIFFERENT FIGURE TO 
THE SEVEN BILLION YOU ARE SUGGESTING 
WITH THE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION YOU COULD 
COMPENSATE AND PAY BACK THE FIVE 
MILLION WHO ARE THE LOSERS IF WE 
ARE SUCCESSFUL AND MAKE THE 
GOVERNMENT THINK AGAIN WE WILL SIT 
DOWN WITH THEM AND HELP THEM WORK 
OUT HOW BEST TO HELP THESE PEOPLE 
THESE ARE HOTEL RECEPTIONIST 
HOSPITAL PORTERS HEALTH WORKERS 
PEOPLE ON LOW INCOME THESE ARE 
PEOPLE EARNING LESS THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND A 
YEAR WHAT I FIND EXTRAORDINARY IS 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE 
TARGETED THESE PEOPLE WE KNOW WHY 
IT HAPPENED IT WAS THE BUDGET LAST 
YEAR WHEN GORDON BROWN WANTED TO 
GET A GOOD HEADLINE AND SAY LOOK AT 
ME I AM CUTTING TAXES FOR A GOOD 
HEADLINE HE WAS PREPARED TO ATTACK 
SOME OF THE LOWEST PAID PEOPLE IN 
OUR COUNTRY WE ATTACKED AT THE 
TIME WE SAID THIS BUDGET IS WRONG 
WE SAID THIS IS A TAX CONWE SAID 
THIS IS GOING TO HURT SOME OF THE 
POOREST PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY IT IT DOES FEEL MR. CAMERON I KNOW I 
SAID IT WAS A TAX CONBECAUSE I 
INTERVIEWED YOU BUT THERE WAS VERY 
LITTLE CONCENTRATION ON THAT TEN 
PENCE TAX BAND FROM ANYONE IT'S 
ONLY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT'S 
HITTING MY PAY PACKET RIGHT NOW 
THAT THE CONSERVATIVES SAYING WHY 
HAVE YOU DONE THIS WHY DIDN'T YOU 
COMPLAIN AT THE TIME 
I WENT BACK IN CHECK WE PUT OUT A 
PRESS RELEASE WITHIN HOURS OF THE 
BUDGET ATTACKING THIS ASPECT OF 
THE BUDGET AND SAYING THAT IT WOULD 
HIT SOME OF THE MOST LOW PAID 
PEOPLE AND WAS BEING DONE IN ORDER 
TO BUY A GOOD HEADLINE FOR THE 
CHANCELLOR WHO WAS ABOUT TO BECOME 
PRIME MINISTER L. THINK THAT IS 
DISGRACEFUL IF YOU LOOK AT MY 
RESPONSE TO THE BUDGET THIS YEAR A 
GOOD PART OF MY RESPONSE TO THAT 
BUDGET WAS SAYING BY THE WAY THERE 
IS ABOUT TO BE A HUGE ONSLAUGHT ON 
SOME OF THE LOWEST PAID PEOPLE IN 
THE COUNTRY INCLUDING SOLDIERS 
SERVING OVERSEAS 
YOU HAVE THE 
CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
FRANK FIELD CAME UP WITH AN 
AMENDMENT THE FORMER LABOUR 
MINISTER SAID THAT WE CAN 
COMPENSATE THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
GOING TO BE WORST OFF GOING TO BE 
HIT BY THIS ABOLITION YOU 
ABSTAINED ON THAT VOTE YOU COULD 
HAVE VOTED FOR IT IN WHICH CASE 
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPENSATED 
FOR LOSING OUT 
FRANK FIELD'S MEANT 
THAT LAST YEAR AT THE TIME OF THE 
BUDGET WAS NOT ACTUALLY A 
COMPENSATION PACKAGE IT WAS 
EFFECTIVELY A TAX CUT THAT WOULD 
HAVE COST FIFTEEN BILLION IT NEVER GOT 
PUT TO THE VOTE BUT WE WERE NOT 
PLANNING TO VOTE BECAUSE IT WOULD 
NOT BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE TO VOTE 
FOR AN UNFUNDED FIFTEEN BILLION TAX CUT 
WE ARE PREPARED TO LOOK AT HIS 
AMENDMENT THIS TIME AND WILL PUT 
FORWARD THEIR OWN AMENDMENT WE ARE 
PREPARED TO WORK WITH ANYBODY WHO 
WANTS TO TO GET THE GOVERNMENT TO 
STOP THINK AGAIN AND HELP THESE 
FIVE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
TARGETED IN A QUITE DISGRACEFUL 
WEIGHED IN ORDER FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
TO HAVE THAT HEADLINE ONE YEAR AGO 
WE HAVE TAPPED WE HAVE CUT 
TAXES ARDLEY CLEVER IT IS 
DISGRACEFUL 
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DISGRACEFUL RESTORE THE TEN P. TAX BAND THAT SHE 
WOULD CONSIDER TALKING TO THE 
GOVERNMENT ABOUT SOME COMPENSATION 
PACKAGE FOR THOSE FIVE MILLION PEOPLE 
SOME WAY OF HELPING THEM YES IT 
IS NOT RIGHT ALL OF US CAN 
REMEMBER WHEN TAXES WENT UP FOR 
EVERYBODY BECAUSE TIMES WERE TOUGH 
AND WHEN TIMES WERE GOOD SO TAXES 
CAME DOWN FOR EVERYBODY L. CAN'T 
REMEMBER A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT 
TARGETED SOME OF THE LOWEST PAID 
PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY SAYING THAT 
OTHERS MAY BENEFIT BUT WE WILL GET 
YOU THEY HAVE SAID THAT IN A 
FUTURE BUDGET WE MIGHT JUST HELP 
YOU BUT THAT IS JUST NOT GOOD 
ENOUGH I WILL USE ALL MY POWER IN 
PARLIAMENT TO TRY TO GET THEM TO 
STOP AND THINK AGAIN 
MOVING A DO 
SOMETHING ELSE THAT HAS BEEN TAXING 
OUR VIEWERS ABOUT THIS BANK RESCUE 
PLAN WITHIN THE NEXT CAR PERHAPS 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND WILL ANNOUNCE A 
FIFTY BILLION RESCUE PACKAGE IN THE 
FORM OF LOANS BACKED BY THE 
TAXPAYER LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING 
WHY THE TAXPAYER SHOULD BACK 
FINANCIALLY RISKY MORTGAGE DEALS BY 
LENDERS 
I THINK I DO SUPPORT THIS LENDERS PACKAGE BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND L. 
THINK IT IS RIGHT WE HAVE GOT TO 
TRY TO GET THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 
MOVING AGAIN IT DOES NOT BENEFIT 
ANYBODY IF WE HAVE A SITUATION TO 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH THAT BANKS ARE 
NOT LENDING TO EACH OTHER AND THE 
WHOLE WHEELS OF THE MONETARY 
ECONOMY ARE NOT MOVING WE HAVE TO 
GET THEM MOVING AGAIN IT REALLY 
MATTERS THOUGH THAT THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND ARE EMBARKING ON SOMETHING 
THAT IS A SENSIBLE SUPPORT PACKAGE 
FOR BANKS AND QUESTIONS WE WILL BE 
ASKING IN PARLIAMENT TODAY ARE 
WHETHER THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT 
DISCOUNT AT WHICH THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND IS TAKING ON THESE BONDS 
ARE THE BANKS PAYING FOR THE 
SERVICE RATHER THAN JUST GETTING IT 
FOR FREE THESE ARE IMPORTANT 
POINTS WE WANT TO KNOW THAT IT IS 
SENSIBLE MEASURES TO GET IT MOVING 
AGAIN NOT A BANK RESCUE AND NOT A 
BAIL OUT FOR BANKS THAT HAVE 
BEHAVED BADLY 
JOHN E. MAILED ASKING 
CAN MR. CAMERON DEMAND THAT IN 
RETURN FOR OUR BOND TO GUARANTEE 
THEIR RISKY LOANS THE MORTGAGE 
RATE HAS TO BE LINKED TO THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND RATE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN 
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS IS 
THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND LOWERED 
ITS INTEREST RATE WHICH IS NOT 
TAKEN UP BY MORTGAGE LENDERS I I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE HE IS 
COMING FROM IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING 
IF YOU WORRY HOMEOWNER PAYING YOUR 
MORTGAGE YOU SEE INTEREST RATES 
COULD PUT YOUR BANK OR BUILDING 
SOCIETY DOES NOT REDUCE THE RATES 
HOWEVER I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO 
THAT WE CAN'T GO TO A SYSTEM WHERE 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND CAN ORDER EVERY 
BANK OR BUILDING SOCIETY TO REDUCE 
ITS RATES IN LINE WITH THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND IF YOU DO THAT YOU ARE 
OFFICIALLY EFFECTIVELY 
NATIONALISING THE BANKS AND 
BUILDING SOCIETIES 
YOU ARE TALKING 
ABOUT POLLY CLINICS TODAY AN ISSUE 
THAT MAY BE AFFECTED OUR VIEWERS 
WHAT WOULD THE CONSERVATIVES DO 
ABOUT THEM 
WE DO NOT WANT TOP DOWN 
CLAMP PLANS TO OPPOSE THEM ON 
FAMILY DOCTORS YOU SAW IN YOUR 
STUDIO LAST WEEK A DOCTOR AND A G. P. 
SAYING IT IS A BAD IDEA WE ARE 
VERY WORRIED ABOUT THIS WE HAVE 
ESTIMATED IT COULD LEAD TO OVER 
SEVENTEEN HUNDRED G. P.'S SURGERIES CLOSING 
INCLUDING ONE THOUSAND AND LONDON WE THINK 
THIS TOP DOWN PLAN IS JUST ANOTHER 
KIND OF FAT FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
THEY WANTED TO CLOSE DOWN THE 
DISTRICT GENERAL HOSPITALS AND THE 
MATERNITY UNIT NOW THEY'RE TRYING 
TO CLOSE THE FAMILY DOCTORS 
SERVICES WE'RE RUNNING A CAMPAIGN 
SAYING THAT THEY HAVE TO STOP DOING 
THIS IF DOCTORS WANT TO GET 
TOGETHER AND OFFER MORE SERVICES 
FINE BUT WE DO NOT WANT ANOTHER 
TOP DOWN IMPOSED GOVERNMENT 
SOLUTION ON THE N. H. S. WE HAVE HAD 
ENOUGH OF THAT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOR COMING IN THIS MORNING MR. 
CAMERON THANK YOU 
THE WEATHER COULD BE GETTING 
WARMER 
AT LONG LAST SOME GOOD NEWS 
TEMPERATURES SLOWLY CREEPING UP A 
LITTLE BIT MUCH MILDER THAN IT WAS 
LAST WEEK IT WILL FEEL QUITE WARM 
WANT TO SEE SOME SUNSHINE NOT A 
GREAT DEAL OF SUNSHINE AT THE 
MOMENT A GREY START TO THE NEW 
WORKING WEEK FOR MOST OF US IT IS 
DRY YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE HAD SOME 
RAIN PUSHING UP FROM THE NEAR 
CONTINENT IN A CROSS ARE THE MOST 
COUNTIES OF ENGLAND HERE ARE THE 
AREAS THAT ARE SAID TO BE QUITE WET 
ANYTHING FROM SUSSEX AND SURREY 
WEST TOWARDS DEVON AND CORNWALL 
SOME HAVE THE PULSES OF RAIN 
GENERALLY SOUTH OF THE M. FOUR BUT THE 
ODD SPOT OF RAIN FURTHER NORTH 
INCLUDING SOME SOUTHERN PART OF 
WALES ELSEWHERE ONE A TWO 
BRIGHTER BREAKS BUT GENERALLY A LOT 
OF CLOUD THE CLOUD WILL BREAK 
THROUGH THE MORNING INTO THE 
AFTERNOON SO MORE SUNSHINE 
DEVELOPING BY FOUR P. M. ACROSS NORTHERN 
IRELAND A REASONABLY BRIGHT DAY 
WITH SPELLS OF SUNSHINE THERE WILL 
BE A BIT MORE CLOUD THAT WE SAW IN 
THE PAST FEW DAYS A BIT MORE CLOUT 
THAN SUNSHINE IN SCOTLAND BUT 
BRIGHTER MOMENTS WITH LIGHT TO 
WINDS THAN THE WEEKEND FEELING A 
TOUCH MILDER A LIGHTER WINDS A 
RATHER GREY AND CLOUDY AFTERNOON 
THE BEST OF THE SUNNY SKIES IN 
ENGLAND ACROSS EASTERN COUNTIES 
THAT FEELING TOO BAD IN THE COUNTRY 
SUNSHINE FOURTEEN DEGREES BUT THE 
WIND WILL STILL MAKE IT FEEL A 
LITTLE BIT CHILLY ACROSS THE NORTH 
SEA COASTS TWELVE THIRTEEN OR PERHAPS FOURTEEN 
TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST AND WALES 
BUT TEMPERED BY THE FACT WE STILL 
HAVE LOTS OF CLOUD AROUND AND 
FURTHER OUTBREAKS OF RAIN THAT 
RAIN WILL START TO CLEAR THE WAY 
THIS EVENING THROUGH THE REST OF 
THE NIGHT IT SHOULD BE DRY WE 
WILL SEE A LITTLE BIT OF PATCHY 
MIST AND FOG FORMING HERE AND THERE 
TEMPERATURES JUST ABOUT HOLDING UP 
ENOUGH TO AVOID A GROUND FROST 
INTO TUESDAY LOOKING LIKE A VERY 
PLEASANT DAY FOR MUCH OF THE U. K. IT 
SHOULD BE DRY FOR BUT THE FAR WEST 
OF SCOTLAND WHERE THERE COULD BE 
PATCHY RAIN IN THE AFTERNOON SOME 
CLOUD AROUND BUT IT WILL FEEL 
QUITE MILD IN THE SUNNIER MOMENTS 
WITH TEMPERATURES PEAKING AT AROUND 
SEVENTEEN CELSIUS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT OF 
RAIN AT TIMES BACK TO YOU 
ALWAYS WITH A BIT OF RAIN IT 
MIGHT BE WARM BUT WE GET RAIN 
IF YOU HAVE JUST HAD TOAST WITH 
HONEY AND YOU CAN'T RESIST DIPPING 
YOUR FINGERS IN THE JOB FOR MORE 
YOU MIGHT NOT BE HAVING MUCH MORE 
OF IT FRANKLY 
WE HAVE SOME RATHER WORRYING NEWS 
WE ARE TOLD OUR HONEY BEES COULD 
DIE OUT IN TEN YEARS IT WILL NOT 
JUST BE YOUR BREAKFAST THAT IS 
AFFECTED RICHARD WESTCOTT IS WITH 
THE BEES IN HARPENDEN 
GOOD MORNING L. AM JUST BEHIND THAT 
ONE ON THE LEFT THAT IS A LIVE 
CAMERA IN THIS BEEHIVE THIS MORNING 
THEY DO NOT LIKE THE RAIN THEY DO 
NOT LIKE THE COLD THIS IS SUCH A 
STORY THAT MADE ME WHEN I KNEW 
NOTHING ABOUT HONEY BEES TAKE 
NOTICE THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
AROUND A THIRD OF THE FOOD WE EAT 
AND IN DANGER OF DYING OUT 
THIS HIGH SHOULD BE BUZZING WITH 
ACTIVITY DRIPPING WITH NECTAR 
THIS HIVE 
THEY ARE ALL DEAD THE THE ONLY BEES LEFT TO LIVE OUR ROBBERS 
FROM OTHER COLONIES WATCH THEM 
STEAL THE LAST OF THE FOOD 
WHAT IS 
CONCERNING TO ME IS THAT WHATEVER 
VIRUS IS PREVALENT HERE WILL NOW BE 
IN THESE TWO HIVES BEEKEEPERS BEEKEEPERS EXPECT SOME LOSSES OVER THE WINTER 
BUT LAST YEAR AROUND ONE IN FIVE 
HIVES FAILED THEY WORRY THAT THIS 
YEAR WILL BE THE SAME EXPERTS LIKE 
CHRIS PAINT A GRIM PICTURE WE WE COULD WELL BE LOOKING AT THE 
EXTINCTION OF HONEY BEES IN THE U. K. 
IN TEN YEARS WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
ALREADY IS THAT MANAGE COLONIES ARE 
DECLINING WE KNOW THAT THE NUMBER 
OF WILD COLONIES HAS ALMOST DROPPED 
TO ZERO AND I FEAR WE ARE ON THE 
EDGE OF SOMETHING THAT WILL NOT 
BECOME APPARENT UNTIL THE 
CONSEQUENCES BECOME IRREVERSIBLE 
THAT IS WHY THEY WANT THE 
GOVERNMENT TO SPEND EIGHT MILLION 
FINDING OUT EXACTLY WHAT IS KILLING 
THEM OFF WHY ARE HONEY BEES SO 
IMPORTANT HOW DO THEY AFFECT YOUR 
LIFE LOOK AROUND YOUR KITCHEN AND 
YOUR BATHROOM SO MANY THINGS RELY 
ON POLLINATING HONEY BEES SUPER 
FIT LIKE BROCCOLI AND BLUEBERRIES 
KIWI FRUIT AND ALMONDS SUPER 
FOODS COTTON TOO ALSO ONIONS IT 
IS ESTIMATED THAT HONEY BEES PLAY A 
PART IN ONE THIRD OF THE FOODS WE 
EAT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE 
WORRYING APIARISTS LIKE CHRIS AND 
COLIN COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER HAS 
RAVAGED HIDES HIVES IN AMERICA 
BUT NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IS CAUSING IT 
OR WHETHER IT WILL END UP HERE THE 
U. S. GOVERNMENT IS SPENDING MILLIONS 
ON RESEARCH HAAGEN DAZS HAS ALSO 
CHIPPED IN SAYING AROUND HALF ITS 
FLAVOURS WOULD NOT MAKE IT INTO THE 
TUPS WITHOUT THE HONEY BEE HOW 
WORRIED ARE YOU ABOUT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IN AMERICA 
WE ARE VERY 
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN 
AMERICA BECAUSE IT IS VERY 
POSSIBLE THAT IT COULD TRANSLATE 
INTO THE U. K. MANY OF THE BEEKEEPING 
PRACTICES ARE THE SAME AS ARE THE 
BEES 
BEEKEEPERS CLAIMED THAT IF WE BEES LOSE THIS VITAL LINK IN THE FOOD 
CHAIN OUR MOST EFFICIENT POLLINATE 
TOUR WILL NEED MORE IMPORTS AND 
FOOD PRICES COULD SOAR 
DO YOU LIKE OUR SMOKING DOG THAT 
PACIFY AS THE BEES ISN'T THERE 
SOMETHING ARTIFICIAL THAT COULD 
REPLACE KENNY BEES 
THEY ARE 
INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT AT POLLINATION 
THEY TAKE THE FOOD HOME TO THEIR 
YOUNG REALLY WE CAN'T DO IT BY 
HAND OR MECHANICALLY 
TEN YEARS AND 
IT IS ALL OVER 
I DON'T THINK IT 
WILL BE THAT BAD BUT WE NEED TO 
FIND OUT WHAT IS CAUSING THE 
PROBLEMS AND FIND SOLUTIONS 
I WILL 
HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT THIS THEY TIE 
THESE AROUND THE BODY OF THE BEE A 
RADAR THEY CAN FOLLOW WHAT THEY 
ARE DOING ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE 
A LITTLE BIT OF BLUE WHAT IS THIS

PORTSMOUTH THREE TO ONE 
RANGERS HAD A HARD FORT FOUGHT WIN

PENALTIES TO SORT OUT THE POINTS 
WITH COUSIN GETTING THE CRUCIAL 
SPOT KICK 
I'M LOOKING AT YOUR TIE BILL AND 
AS EVER YOU KNOW THAT PINK IS THE 
COLOUR AT THE MOMENT THAT IS 
SARACENS AGAINST WASPS SARACENS IN 
PINK TO SUPPORT CANCER CARE BUT 
SADLY THEY LOST 
AND LATER ON TODAY THE FIRST EVER 
MATCH USING PINK CRICKET BALLS 
THERE IS MATCH AT LORDS TODAY 
M. C. C. VERSUS SCOTLAND AND THEY'RE 
GOING TO USE PINK BALLS TO SEE IF 
THAT IS THE WAY FORWARD WHY THEY WHY THEY THINK WHEN THEY USE WHITE BALL 
AND IT GETS ON THE GRASS IT GETS 
DIRTY THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO CHANGE 
IT AND YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT HOW OLD 
THEY ARE SO THEY WANT A CRICKET 
BALL THAT WILL LAST AND WON'T GET 
DIRTY AND THEY THINK PINK IS THE 
COLOUR I'M PLAYING IN THAT MATCH 
AND IF I GET NOUGHT PINK IS 
DEFINITELY NOT THE COLOUR 
AND THE 
PLAYERS COULD WEAR PINK THAT WOULD 
TAKE THE STING OUT OF THE ATTACK 
YES YOU COULD WALK BEHIND THE 
BALL BALL BRITAIN IS IN THE MIDST OF BLOOD 
CLOT EPIDEMIC APPARENTLY WITH 
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE DYING IN ENGLAND 
EVERY YEAR THAT IS A WORRYING 
WARNING FROM THE THROMBOSIS CHARITY 
LIFEBLOOD AND WANTS TO URGE 
SURGEONS TO USE NEW PILL TO HELP 
PREVENT BLOOD CLOTS 
SHARON WHO HAS SUFFERED FROM A 
CLOT IS HERE WITH DOCTOR ROSEMARY ROZ 
MARIE TELL US ABOUT THIS NEW DRUG 
IT IS A DRUG TO STOP THE BLOOD 
CLOTTING AT PRESENT TWO 
TREATMENTS EITHER REQUIRE AN 
INJECTION OR REQUIRE TAKING A 
TABLET THAT NEEDS MONITORING AND 
CAN INTERACT WITH FOOD THIS TABLET 
DOES NOT INTERACT WITH FOOD AND 
DOES NOT NEED SO MUCH MONITORING 
SO IT WOULD BE MUCH MUCH EASIER TO 
APPLY 
AND AT THE MOMENT IT IS USED APPLY FOR HIP AND KNEE OPERATIONS YES YES BUT THERE IS A HOPE FOR A MUCH 
WIDER USE 
AND SHARON YOU HAVE 
USED IT 
YES I HAVE L. HAD TWO 
HIPS REPLACED A LITTLE WHILE AGO L. 
HAD THE WARFARIN TABLETS FOR SIX 
MONTHS 
AND THAT IS USED BY A LOT MONTHS OF PEOPLE TO THIN THE BLOOD YES YES AND FOR MY HIP OPERATION I HAD THE 
HEPARIN INJECTIONS FOR SIX WEEKS 
WHICH FELT LIKE A BEE STING EACH 
TIME EVERY DAY 
HOW DH CAN YOU 
TELL WHEN YOU GET A BLOOD CLOT YOU YOU DON'T THERE IS NO WARNING 
WHATSOEVER THAT IT HAPPENS YOU 
FEEL AS THOUGH YOU HAVE SUNBURN 
UNDERNEATH YOUR SKIN WITHIN YOUR 
SKIN SO TOUCHING WITH YOUR 
CLOTHES PEOPLE TOUCHING YOU TO 
WASH YOU BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY AFTER 
YOUR HIP OPERATION 
SO IT FEELS 
SENSITIVE 
OH YES 
SO A LOT OF SENSITIVE PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE PROBLEM WITH 
CLOTTING BLOOD BUT DON'T KNOW 
ABOUT IT UNTIL SOMETHING GOES 
WRONG 
YES QUITE OFTEN PEOPLE HAVE WRONG A PROBLEM BUT DON'T NOTICE IT 
UNTIL THEIR SKIN FEELS SENSITIVE OR 
THEIR LIMBS SWELL AND SOME ARE 
NEVER DIAGNOSED AND THEY CAN 
HAPPEN AFTER THE PROBLEM NOW IS 
BECAUSE PATIENTS ARE SENT HOME 
EARLY AFTER SURGERY THESE CLOTS 
CAN HAPPEN AT HOME AND THEY ARE NOT 
PICKED UP 
ARE PEOPLE GIVEN A BLOOD 
CLOTTING PILL AS A MATTER OF 
ROUTINE AFTER SURGERY THEN WHAT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IS THOSE AT RISK 
WHICH IS MOSTLY BIG HIP AND KNEE 
OPERATIONS AFTER A HIP OPERATION 
YOU SHOULD USE ANTI COAGULATION 
FOR A MONTH AFTERWARDS BUT PEOPLE 
GIVEN AN OPERATION INJECTION ARE 
NOT DOING THIS WHICH IS ANOTHER 
REASON WHY WE NEED A SIMPLE PILL 
HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE WOULD THIS MAKE 
SHARON 
OH A LOT OF DIFFERENCE SHARON VERY MUCH SO WITH THE INJECTIONS 
YOU GET BRUISING SO THE EVERY DAY 
LIFE OF CUDDLING AND JUST GENERAL 
SLEEPING 
AND IT'S STAGGERING SLEEPING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE EVERY YEAR BEING 
KILLED BY IT 
YES WELL IT'S RAT 
POISON GOING THROUGH YOUR BLOOD 
STREAM SO IF IT KILLS RATS GOD 
KNOWS WHAT IT IS DOING TO YOUR BODY 
IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
WE ARE NOW 
WAITING FOR NICE TO MAKE A CLINICAL 
DECISION OVER WHAT HAPPENS NOW I I SUSPECT THAT SOME ORTHOPAEDIC 
SURGEONS WILL START TO USE IT 
STRAIGHTAWAY IT LOOKS TO BE THE 
SAME PRICE AS THE DRUGS USED NOW 
BUT PARTICULARLY COMPARED TO 
WARFARIN IT DOES NOT NEED THE 
MONITORING AND I SUSPECT 
ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEONS WILL START 
USING IT AND HOPEFULLY NICE WILL 
FAST TRACK IT THROUGH THIS WILL 
SAVE THE N. H. S. MONEY SO I DON'T 
THINK THERE SHOULD BE A PROBLEM 
WITH GETTING HOLD OF IT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EXPLAINING 
IT AND THANK YOU TOO 
TO AN ACTOR WHO HAS BEEN ACTING 
SINCE THE AGE OF EIGHT MOST PEOPLE 
KNOW ELIJAH WOOD FOR HIS ROLE AS 
FRODO IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS 
TRILOGY BUT SINCE THEN HE HAS 
SHED HIS HAIRY FEET FOR SERIES OF 
FILMS AND HIS LATEST IS A WHO DONE 
IT CALLED THE OXFORD MURDERS AND 
HE CO STARS WITH JOHN HURT 
THAT MAN WAS NOT MAD WHAT WAS SO 
IMPORTANT THAT HE WOULD RISK HIS 
LIFE FOR IT THE ENIGMA THAT HE 
TRIED TO DECIPHER WAS THE FOLLOWING 
AND WE KNOW THE TRUTH ELIJAH ELIJAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING TIME 
TO SPEAK TO US ON BREAKFAST THE 
OXFORD MURDERS NOT MANY FILMS 
MAKE ME FEEL UNINTELLIGENT BUT 
THIS ONE DID 
DID IT 
WELL ALL THE 
MATHS 
WELL THE TRICK IS YOU DON'T MATHS HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THOSE 
THINGS I THINK THE BEAUTY OF THE 
FILM IS THAT THERE IS THE SORT OF 
INTELLIGENCE OF THE MATHS AND I 
THINK THAT ULTIMATELY IT ALL DOES 
MAKE SENSE BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
YOU DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY 
UNDERSTAND IT TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW 
THE STORY WHICH IS IMPORTANT 
IF WE MANAGE TO UNDERSTAND THE 
SECRET MEANING OF NUMBERS WE WILL 
KNOW THE SECRET MEANING OF REALITY 
IMPRESSIVE IMPRESSIVE TRANSLATING HIS WORDS INTO THE 
QUEEN'S ENGLISH 
YOU PLAY AN 
AMERICAN STUDENT VISITING OXFORD 
VERY VERY INTELLIGENT AND YOU WANT 
TO HOOK UP WITH JOHN HURT WHO IS 
AN INCREDIBLY BRIGHT PROFESSOR MY MY CHARACTER WANTS TO STUDY UNDER HIM 
AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE FILM YOU 
LEARN THAT HE ONE QUITE OBSESSED WITH 
HIM HIM WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE 
I LIVE 
HERE WHAT IS YOUR EXCUSE 
I CAME 
HERE TO VISIT AN OLD FRIEND THESE THESE MURDERS OCCUR AND THE TWO OF THEM 
DISCOVER THE FIRST BODY TOGETHER 
AND AS A RESULT IT SETS FORTH THIS 
SERIES OF MURDERS THAT THE TWO OF 
THEM THEN TRY TO DETERMINE WHO THE 
KILLER IS 
AWAY FROM THE SCREEN THOUGH YOU 
ARE SAID TO BE VERY BIG COLLECTOR 
OF MUSIC SOMEBODY BROKE INTO YOUR 
HOUSE AND COUNTED SIX THOUSAND C. D.'S IT'S IT'S ABOUT SIX THOUSAND 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO 
PLAY A LEGEND OF ROCK MUSIC IGGY IGGY POP YES 
JOOSH I'VE GOT TO GO HOW 
PRESUMABLY HE'S A MAN YOU ADMIRE 
YES GREATLY IT'S ALWAYS A 
CHALLENGE TO PLAY AN ICON OF ANY 
SORT PEOPLE HAVE A PERSPECTIVE OF 
WHO THAT PERSON IS AND YOU'RE 
BATTLING AGAINST THAT L. HAD THAT 
WITH LORD OF THE RINGS BUT THAT IS 
A WRITTEN CHARACTER SO IT IS NOT AS 
WIDESPREAD BUT WITH IGGY HE IS 
STILL ALIVE

FANTASY OF SINGING IN A BAND OFFER

WHEN YOU GATHER YOUR THOUGHTS AND 
WE SAW YOU GOING ALL RIGHT YOU

DRY THERE IS SUNSHINE AT THE 
MOMENT HERE AND THERE AND WE WILL 
SEE THE CLOUD BREAK UP ELSEWHERE 
AND SEE A FEW MORE IN THE WAY OF 
BRIGHTER SPELLS DEVELOP A PLEASANT 
DAY TO COME AIN NORTHERN IRELAND 
WE WILL SEE SPELLS OF SUNSHINE 
LIGHT BREEZE AND TEMPERATURES TWELVE 
CELSIUS IN BELFAST MORE CLOUD IN 
SCOTLAND THAN IN RECENT DAYS BUT 
AT LEAST THE WIND IS LIGHTER 
AFTER SUNSHINE THIS MORNING NORTH 
WEST ENGLAND AND THE NORTH WEST 
MIDLANDS CLOUDIER INTO THIS 
AFTERNOON BUT EAST OF THE PENNINES 
AND THROUGH MANY EASTERN COUNTIES 
OF ENGLAND SOME LONGER SPELLS OF 
SUNSHINE DEVELOPING A STILL 
LITTLE CHILLY ACROSS THE NORTH SEA 
COASTS THANKS TO THE WIND COMING IN 
BUT INLAND IN THE SUNSHINE 
SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO BAD THE SOUTH 
WEST MIDLANDS SOUTH WEST ENGLAND 
AND THROUGH WALES IT WILL REMAIN 
CLOUDY GREY SKIES AND THERE WILL 
BE RAIN TO SOUTH WALES DEVON 
CORNWALL AND SOMERSET BUT THAT 
WILL EASE OFF DURING THE COMING 
EVENING ALL OF US SHOULD HAVE A 
DRY NIGHT AND WITH WINDS FALLING 
LIGHTER THERE WILL BE THE ODD MIST 
OR FOG POCKET STARTING TO FORM IT 
SHOULD BE FROST FREE TEMPERATURES 
FOR THE MOST PART AROUND FIVE TO EIGHT 
CELSIUSMENT INTO TOMORROW MORNING A 
PLEASANT START FOR MOST OF US THE 
MIST AND FOG CLEARING LONG SPELLS 
OF SUNSHINE DEVELOP AND IN THE 
SUNSHINE IT WILL FEEL WARM WITH 
TEMPERATURES AROUND SEVENTEEN CELSIUS 
WE HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL SINGING 
ARTIST IN WHO LOOKED AT BILL AND 
SAID YOU DO BIT OF SINGING DON'T 
YOU NOT KNOWING THAT ALL BILL 
DOES IS PUB SINGING ANYWAY CHRIS 
DE BURGH IS IN 
YOU WANT TO HEAR HIM DOING MISS 
LADY IN RED 
LADY IN RED RED GIVE HIM A FIVER SOMEBODY 
HE IS HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOT A 
NEW ALBUM OUT OF YOUR CLASSICS 
HAVEN'T YOU YES YES ON IT IS NEW SINGLE 
THE ALBUM IS 
A RETROSPECT ACROSS THIRTY FOUR YEARS OF A 
YEAR COVERING A LOT OF SONGS THAT 
PEOPLE MAY HAVE HEARD A COUPLE OF 
TIMES AND FORGOTTEN ABOUT BUT IT 
IS ON THE BIG HITS 
AND THE SINGLE THAT WE'RE GOING TO 
HEAR NOW 
I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW THERE 
IS SO MUCH THAT I HAVE TO SEE 
FIN THE ROAD THAT WE MUST FOLLOW 
DESTINY DESTINY TAKE MY HAND AND LEAD ME ON SHOW 
ME A WORLD THAT IS IN MY DREAMS 
BE THE LIGHT THAT IS ALWAYS SHINING 
OVER ME AS I BELIEVE THAT WE MUST 
LIVE FOR A DAY SHARE EVERY 
PRECIOUS MOMENT THIS IS THE WAY WE 
WILL BE FOREVER 
WE MUST LIVE FOR THE DAY 
TREASURE THE SPECIAL MEMORIES AND 
I'LL BE THERE 
I'LL BE THERE 
IT IS LOVELY IT IS VERY CATCHY 
THE YOUNG LADY IS CALLED TINA AND 
IN BETWEEN DOING CONCERTS I WENT 
TO BUY ROUTE FOR THE THIRD BEIRUT 
TO DO A T. V. SHOW CALLED STAR ACADEMY 
IT INVOLVES YOUNGSTERS FROM ALL THE 
ARAB COUNTRIES UNDER THE SAME ROOF 
AND EVERY WEEK FOR THREE MONTHS 
THEY PUT ON A SHOW TO SEVENTY MILLION 
PEOPLE LIVE AND LAST YEAR WHEN I 
WAS ON IT I HEARD THIS SINGER 
CALLED TINA FROM BUY ROUTE AND I 
THOUGHT BEIRUT AND I THOUGHT SHE 
HAD A STUNNING VOICE AND MY RECORD 
COMPANY HAVE TAKEN HER ON AND I I 
SANG AND WROTE THAT SONG WITH HER 
SHE IS TWENTY YEARS OLD AND WHAT A 
VOICE AND SHE SINGS IN ARABIC TOO 
OF COURSE 
I FOUND THAT MIDDLE EASTERN SINGERS 
ARE CROPPING UP AND WHEN YOU HEAR 
THEM THEY HAVE REMARKABLE VOICES 
BECAUSE SINGING IN ARABIC TAKES 
LOT MORE VOCAL STRENGTH 
IT IS AND 
THEY COVER DIFFERENT NOTES WE DON'T 
REALLY UNDERSTAND OR APPRECIATE L. 
HAVE DONE A COLLABORATION WITH A 
BAND IN IRAN AND THEY HAVE THEIR 
OWN INSTRUMENTS AND IT IS LOVELY 
IT IS ONE OF MY SONGS CALLED THE 
WORDS I LOVE YOU L. AM GOING TO 
MAKE A SHORT TRIP THERE BECAUSE I 
HAVE BEEN INVITED TO PERFORM THERE 
AND PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE SAYING YOU 
MUSTN'T BE NAIVE BUT WE ARE 
POLITICALLY AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING 
ON WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A SHORT 
THREE TRIP TO SEE WHAT THINGS ARE 
LIKE SO THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING 
THE ARABIC PART OF THE SONG HERE 
WE ARE NOW 
LIVE FOR THE DAY 
SHARE EVERY PRECIOUS MOMENT 
AND I WILL BE THERE 
I I CAN'T DO THAT 
THE OTHER DAY WHEN WHEN WHEN TINA 
AND I WERE DOING A RADIO PROGRAMME 
TOGETHER THIS VOICE BECAME BELTING 
OUT OF THIS BILL FRAME 
YOU SAID SHE WAS TWENTY AND DON'T PAY 
THE FERRYMAN BASS MADE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO 
YES AND LADY IN RED WAS NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
THIS RECORD FOR ME IT WAS EXCITING 
THERE HE IS AGAIN 
HE LOOKS YOUNGER OH MY GOD TIMES 
CHANGE CHANGE YOU ARE NO DIFFERENT 
GOING THROUGH AND SELECTING THE 
TRACKS AND THINKING I REMEMBER 
RECORDING THAT ONE NOW THE 
CHANCES OF SOMEBODY HAVING A THIRTY FOUR 
YEAR CAREER YOU JUST CAN'T DO IT 
YOU MUST BE SICK TO THE BACK TEETH 
WITH THAT SONG 
I LOVE IT IT IS MY SIGNATURE TUNE 
BUT LADY IN RED IS ONE OF THE MOES 
OF THE MOST PLAYED RECORDS IN THE 
WORLD I DO LOTS OF CONCERTS WITH 
MY BAND ALL OVER THE WORLD AND WHEN 
PEOPLE COME TO HEAR THAT SONG IT 
IS THE QUIET SONG THIS IS A ROCK 
SHOW SHOW DO YOU HAVE TO SING IT THE SAME 
WAY 
NO I HAVE BEEN DOING IT WAY DIFFERENTLY I PUT ON A HEAD SET 
AND A GUITAR WITH MICROPHONE AND I 
WALK AROUND SINGING IT AROUND THE 
AUDIENCE IT SOUNDS CHEESY BUT 
THEY LOVE IT YOU ARE FALLING OVER 
PEOPLE AND GIVING SOMEBODY A HUG 
AND AT THE END OF THE SHOW WE PUT 
IN THE REAL VERSION AGAIN IF IT IS 
ONE OF THOSE PLACES THAT REALLY 
LOVE THE SONG 
THAT'S NICEZ 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO TO 
CONCERTS YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE 
OLD ONES AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE A 
LONG TIME COMING AND THE AUDIENCE 
ARE SHOUTING IT OUT HAVE DONE IT 
WITH VAN MORRISON AND THERE IS 
RELUCTANCE FROM SOME ARTISTS 
I REMEMBER A BRITISH BAND MOANING 
ABOUT A SONG CALLED STAIRWAY TO 
HEAVEN AND THEY WERE SAYING WE 
DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS ONE AND I 
SAID HANG ON THIS MADE YOU SO 
POPULAR OVER THE WORLD LADY IN 
RED IS POPULAR PARTICULARLY IN 
COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DON'T SPEAK 
ENGLISH NOW FIGURE THAT ONE

I'M NOT LEAVING YOU PETER THERE'S 
ANOTHER WAY TO END THIS AND YOU

HOW DID YOU PUT 
THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER WELL WELL THAT'S THE QUESTION EARLIER IN THE 
SERIES YOU FIND THAT PETER PICKS UP 
ABILITIES FROM OTHER PEOPLE AND THE 
ABILITY TO BE NUCLEAR HE PICKED UP 
FROM THIS GUY TED AND YOU KNOW 
I THINK THE GUY WOULD JUST EMIT 
THAT SO WHETHER HE BLEW UP OR NOT 
YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW 
BECAUSE IN 
AGAIN YOU HAVE A BEARD AND NO NO NO THAT'S NATHAN 
OH I'M THE 
WRONG WAY ROUND 
WE DO LOOK LIKE 
BROTHERS 
HE HAD A BRIEFING FROM BROTHERS HIS FAMILY AND EVERYTHING FOR 
THOSE OF US WHO STRUGGLED A LITTLE 
BIT IN SERIES ONE IT IS QUITE 
COMPLICATED SO GIVE US A PRECIS 
IF YOU CAN SET US STRAIGHT SO SO MANY QUESTIONS AND SO MANY THINGS 
TO ANSWER YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT 
THE GOAL IS TO SET THOSE QUESTIONS 
AND LEAVE IT TO THE AUDIENCE WHO 
ARE A SMART LOT OF PEOPLE TO SEEK 
WHAT THE ANSWER IS AND REALLY 
INVEST THEMSELVES IN THE SHOW AND 
THESE CHARACTERS AND THESE AMAZING 
TALES AND THE STORIES THEY ARE 
GOING THROUGH 
SOMEBODY SAID IT WAS 
LIKE A RUBIK'S CUBE OF A DRAMA IT IT IS 
I WAS ALWAYS RUBBISH AT THOSE IS ME TOO 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
NEW SERIES 
THE SUNRISES ON A NEW 
DAWN YET FEW OF US REALISE THE 
DEBT WE OWE TO THOSE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THIS THOSE WHO DWELL AMONGST 
US ANONYMOUS SEEMINGLY ORDINARY 
WHOM DESTINY BROUGHT TOGETHER TO 
REPAIR TO HEAL TO SAVE US FROM 
OURSELVES OURSELVES IF EVOLUTION CAN DO THIS FOR EVEN 
THE SMALLEST OF CREATURES WHY NOT 
FOR ALL OF US 
IF SOMEBODY FOUND OUT 
ABOUT ME FORTY FIVE WOULD HAPPEN WHY WHY DON'T THEY STOP 
I DON'T KNOW 
SHE'S SHINY NEW TOY AND SHE IS 
ALL MINE

REALITY TO BE EXTRAORDINARY 
THERE WE ARE AND NOT ONLY DO I 
HAVE TROUBLE SEPARATING CHARACTERS 
FROM EACH OTHER BUT ALSO I'M 
FRYING TO WORK OUT YOU'RE NEVER 
SURE WHO IS GOOD AND WHO IS NOT SO 
GOOD ABSOLUTELY 
IT KEEPS YOU GOOD ABSOLUTELY GUESSING THE WHOLE TIME 
AND IF YOU 
THINK ABOUT HUMAN NATURE THERE ARE 
PARTS OF OUR PSYCHE THAT ARE GOOD 
AND BAD IT'S JUST A MATTER OF 
CONTROLLING THEM SO WHERE SOMEBODY 
CAN APPEAR GOOD OR BAD THEY MAY 
HAVE DIFFERENT INTENTION 
AND WHAT 
IS THE CHEERLEADER WHY DID WE HAVE 
TO SAVE HER 
I DON'T QUITE I 
DON'T WANT TO SAY I DON'T KNOW BUT 
I WILL SAY THERE IS MORE TO BE 
DISCOVERED WITH THAT GOING INTO 
THE THIRD SERIES 
A LOT OF THE MAIN

FOR GLOBES AND MES BUT THIS IS THE 
FIRST MAJOR MAJOR AWARD ABROAD
