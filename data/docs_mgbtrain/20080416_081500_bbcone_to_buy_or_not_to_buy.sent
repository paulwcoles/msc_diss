THE FOURTH ONE'S FOR A CARER YES FAIR ENOUGH BUT YOU ALSO WANT AN OFFICE ABSOLUTELY

A FOUR BED HOUSE WITH NO OFFICE THE WORLD'S YOUR OYSTER EXACTLY 
THAT'S BECAUSE I LISTENED YOU DID 
KRISTIAN GETS THE CUFFLINKS I COME UP WITH THE BRIGHT IDEAS

DOMINIC AND I HAVE ALSO FOUND A WILD CARD YOU LIKE NEW BUILDS THIS ONE IS VERY NEW FOLLOW ME 
LOCAL AMENITIES CLOSE BY ARE VERY HANDY BUT CAN ALSO BRING NOISE 
IF JED AND LIZ ARE REALLY SERIOUS THEY MUST COME BACK PREFERABLY WITHOUT YOUR YAKKING AND LISTEN 
WE'VE ALSO DISCOVERED THE SUPERMARKET WANTS TO EXTEND 
LOCAL PLANNERS REFUSED PERMISSION BUT AN APPEAL MAY BE SUCCESSFUL 
OUR WILD CARD MIGHT NOT BE BUILT YET BUT ONLY A STICK IN THE MUD WOULDN'T CONSIDER THESE PROPERTIES 
IN THE HEART OF LEAMINGTON SPA 
AND IT WON'T BE TOO FAR INTO THE FUTURE BEFORE THESE ARE READY 
AND THE SHOW HOME WILL GIVE THEM AN IDEA 
O. K. PROPERTY NUMBER THREE 
THE WILD CARD IT'S GOING TO BE WILD WHAT JOYS AND DELIGHTS DO WE HAVE AS THE WILD CARD 
FRANKLY AS YOU CAN HEAR BY THE NOISE THE WILD CARD ISN'T ACTUALLY BUILT YET 
WE CAN'T OBVIOUSLY WALK YOU ROUND THAT ONE 
SO WE'LL SHOW YOU A LOOK ALIKE WITH ONE LESS BEDROOM WHAT DO YOU THINK LOOKS SMALL 
IT DOES SO DOES DOM BUT I LIKE HIM HANG ON THEY DON'T PACK DYNAMITE IN BIG BOXES 
WHAT ABOUT YOU JED SMALL WAS THE FIRST WORD I THOUGHT OF YES 
THEN YOU'RE IN FOR A SURPRISE IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN IT LOOKS YES BUT 
IT'S A NEW BUILD HOUSE SO EVERYTHING IS UP TO MODERN DAY STANDARDS 
BUT YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION A LITTLE BIT IT IS A SHOW HOUSE AND ONLY VERY LIGHTLY FURNISHED 
IMAGINE YOUR OWN FURNITURE IN THERE OFF YOU GO GO AND ENJOY 
THANK YOU THEY DIDN'T BAT AN EYELID WITH ALL THAT NOISE GOING ON 
YEAH ALL THOSE BUILDERS ARE ABOUT TO TAKE THE MICKEY OUT OF US 
OH THIS IS NICE 
SHADES OF MAGNOLIA 
MORE T. V. GLAMOUR A BUILDING SITE TOOL SHED 
WE COULD BE STANDING OUT IN THE MUD AND RAIN YEAH 
STRAIGHT INTO THE SITTING ROOM THEY'VE MISSED THE TOILET 
IT'S OBVIOUS IT'S A TOILET CHECK OUT THE FITTINGS 
IT'S BIG YEAH IT IS VERY NICE A BIT AT THE BACK 
GOT A LOT OF LIGHT AS WELL I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE KITCHEN STRAIGHT ONTO THE LIVING ROOM 
NO THAT'S A REAL DOWN POINT ISN'T IT REALLY 
YOU GET ALL THE SMELLS FROM THE KITCHEN 
IT'S A NICE KITCHEN A MUCH BETTER COOKER THAN WE'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT YES IT'S NICE ISN'T IT 
I NEED TO CHANGE MY COOKER 
IT IS AS WE SAID A NICE BIG ROOM 
YES NOW I REALLY LIKE THAT WINDOW UP THERE I LIKE THAT 
IT'S A REALLY NICE FEATURE SKYLIGHT WINDOW 
HAVE YOU NOTICED NO GARDEN 
LOW MAINTENANCE AGAIN BUT WHERE WOULD THE CHILDREN GO 
IS THERE ANY GREEN NEAR HERE I DON'T KNOW 
THAT'S GREAT FOR ME 
YES WE'D BE OVERLOOKED AS WELL 
YES WHICH ISN'T REALLY WHAT WE WANT 
I KNOW A NEW BUILD IS QUITE HARD TO GET EXCITED ABOUT WHITE WALLS MAGNOLIA CREAM CARPETS 
BUT IN THERE ARE A LOT OF FEATURES THAT THEY SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO AND THEY'RE IGNORING IT ALL 
I WONDER WHICH BEDROOM THIS IS WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT IT TO BE 
IT'S GOT AN EN SUITE WHICH IS REALLY NICE 
TWO BATHROOMS AND TWO BEDROOMS ON THAT FLOOR IT'S VERY NICE 
I LIKE THE SHOWER THAT'S REALLY NICE I LIKE THE WAY IT OPENS UP THAT'S REALLY COOL 
LOOKS POWERFUL YEAH 
NICE AND LIGHT WITH THESE WINDOWS 
NOWHERE IN THERE DOES IT FEEL PARTICULARLY DARK 
UNLESS YOU WALK INTO THE CUPBOARD AND CLOSE THE DOOR DOMINIC YES 
I WASN'T GOING TO SAY THAT NO JUST SHUT YOUR EYES 
BEDROOM TWO 
THIS IS REALLY SMALL ABOUT THE SIZE OF OUR NUMBER FOUR 
ISN'T IT YES 
THEY'RE JUST BEING SO FLAT ABOUT IT THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE WE RECOMMEND THIS IS THE SHOW HOUSE 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FIVE BED VERY GOOD POINT 
CAN YOU GET A BAD AND A WARDROBE AND A TABLE TECHNICALLY YOU COULD GET A DOUBLE IN BUT 
IT WOULD BE A SQUEEZE YES AND YOU COULD PROBABLY GET A WARDROBE AT THE END 
BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT YOU COULDN'T FIT ANYTHING ELSE IN 
THEY'RE VERY CONSERVATIVE IN THEIR COMMENTS 
AGAIN YOU GET PLENTY OF LIGHT IN MM 
WHAT YOU AND I DO IS WE CALL A SPADE A SPADE SHOVEL 
SHOWER BUT NO SHOWER RAIL 
OH THAT WOULD BE WHAT TEN POINT NINE NINE 
OH THIS IS SUCH A WEIRD SHAPE MM 
LOOK GOOD GRIEF 
REALLY PECULIAR MAXIMISING USE OF SPACE 
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THIS YOU'RE IN THE ROOF 
DEAR POINTS OF VIEW WHY DID THEY SHOW US THIS HOUSE 
ANOTHER FUNNY SHAPED ROOM THE FIRST PROPERTY WAS A BOX SHAPE 
SHOW THEM AN INTERESTING SHAPE AND WHAT'S THE PROBLEM NOT SHAPED LIKE A BOX CAN'T WIN 
THIS HAS ROOM FOR A DOUBLE MM 
GUEST ROOM

AT THE BACK THE GARDEN FENCE RUNS IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
AS THESE PROPERTIES STAGGER FURTHER OUT YOU GET A LARGER AND LARGER GARDEN AT THE BACK 
IDEAL NOT ONLY THAT THOUGH BUT IF YOU PICK YOUR HOUSE CAREFULLY 
FOR EXAMPLE ONE HERE WOULD TAKE MY FANCY 
IT'S GOT A COMMUNAL ALLEYWAY WHOEVER BUYS THAT HOUSE GETS ALL THAT UPSTAIRS SPACE 
AND THAT'S AN EXTRA BEDROOM THERE FIVE BEDROOMS JUST WHAT YOU WANTED IDEALLY WASN'T IT 
PERFECT I HAVE ONE OTHER GREAT IDEA GO ON GOING BACK IN THE WARM 
A SHOW HOME DOES GIVE A GOOD IDEA ABOUT THE REST OF THE HOUSES BUT 
A SHOW HOME IS A VERY GLOSSY ADVERT 
THE SITE MANAGER SETS THE STANDARD ON THE SITE AND IS THE PERSON YOU'LL DEAL WITH IF YOU HAVE ANY NIGGLES 
IT'S THE FINAL GUESS THE PRICE TIME

WHEN WE WALKED INTO THAT BATHROOM I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THE WAY THE GREEN MERGED INTO THE ORANGE 
ORANGE TILES AVOCADO BASE 
BUT THEY HAVE DONE THE TOP BATHROOM THAT'S THE POTENTIAL VERY NICE 
THE WORK THEY HAVE DONE I REALLY LIKE THIS IS PROPERTY TWO 
I LIKE IT FROM THE OUTSIDE NICE SPACE IN THE LIVING ROOM 
INTO THE KITCHEN THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT IT'S A KITCHEN CUM DINER 
YOU GO INTO THE MASTER ROOM AND IT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZE 
THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THE SHAPE WITH THE ROOF COMING DOWN 
HOUSE NUMBER THREE THE WILD CARD 
IT WAS QUITE A BIG LIVING ROOM YES I LIKED THAT AND I REALLY LIKED THIS KITCHEN 
BUT KITCHEN OPENING DIRECTLY ONTO THE LIVING ROOM I LIKE THE BEDROOM 
IT WAS NICE YES ALTHOUGH THE THING I NOTICED ABOUT THIS BEDROOM IS IT WAS STILL QUITE SMALL MM HMM 
I HATE TO SOUND LIKE AN OLD RECORD BUT KRISTIAN GETS THE GIFTS YET I FOUND THE HOUSE FOR YOU 
YOU'VE CHOSEN NUMBER TWO I'D LIKE TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU LIZ 
BEFORE WE LET YOU IN OUR VERY OWN SURVEYOR HAS BEEN ROUND AND GIVEN IT THE ONCE OVER 
NOW IT'S NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY IF YOU'RE GOING TO PURCHASE A PROPERTY GET A FULL SURVEY DONE

IT HAS A SMOKE DETECTION SYSTEM AND A PROTECTED FIRE ESCAPE ROUTE 
IN ALL THE APPROPRIATE ROOMS IT HAS FIREPROOF DOORS SO YOU SHOULD GET OUT SAFE AND SOUND 
AND SURVEYORS ALWAYS LOOK FOR THE BAD THINGS SO IT'S NICE WHEN THEY SAY SOMETHING ENCOURAGING

MY SON GOES TO THE SECONDARY AND THAT'S FAIRLY LOCAL IS IT JUST OVER THE BACK 
WHY WALK ALL THAT WAY WITH A SUPERMARKET RIGHT OUTSIDE 
BACK AT THE HOUSE THEY DON'T WASTE ANY TIME GETTING THEIR MEAL READY 
THE THING I REALLY LIKE IS THE LOVELY ATMOSPHERE WHAT DID THE SURVEYOR SAY WELL PROPORTIONED 
THEY SEEM TO LOVE THE HOUSE BUT ARE THEY WILD ABOUT BEING SO CLOSE TO THE AISLES 
WHILE I WAS OUT AT THE SHOPS WAS IT EASY TO CONCENTRATE WITH A SUPERMARKET ON THE DOORSTEP

OH I KNOW WHY WE REALLY LIKE THIS HOUSE 
BUT IT'S VERY NICE WITH THE FACILITIES BEING SO CLOSE BUT IT'S JUST A LITTLE TOO CLOSE
