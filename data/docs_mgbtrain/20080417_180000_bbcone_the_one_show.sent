MOSLEY AND DOCTOR SARAH JARVIS LOOK AT 
THEM THERE 
NIGEL KENNEDY EVERYBODY WHAT A 
MAN MAN 
HE IS AN ASTON VILLA FAN BUT WE 
MADE HIM COVER IT UP WHAT WAS 
THAT 
THAT WAS A BIT OF IT'S A THAT VIOLIN I WAS PLAYING BACH ON THERE 
ONE OF THE FOUNDER STAPLE COMPOSERS 
THAT WE STUDY IN CLASSICAL MUSIC 
IT SOUNDED YOU HAVE THE HANG OF 
IT 
I AM TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT IT TOMORROW THOUSANDS OF PSYCHICS WILL 
BAND TOGETHER TO PROTEST AGAINST AN 
ACT OF PARLIAMENT AIMED AT BRINGING 
THEM UNDER TIGHTER CONTROL 
IN A 
MOMENT THE WORLD'S MOST FAME USE 
PSYCHIC INVESTIGATORS JAMES RANDI 
HE HAS PUT UP A MILLION DOLLARS OF 
HIS OWN MONEY FOR ANYONE WHO PROVE 
THEY HAVE SPECIAL POWERS HE HAS 
HAS TELL US WHY HE HAS NO TAKERS 
YET 
FIRST MICHAEL MOSLEY ASKS IF YET THE EVIDENCE AGAINST MEDIUMS IS 
JUST TOO LARGE 
I HAVE HAD AN EXTENSIVE SCIENTIFIC 
TRAINING WHICH HAS TAUGHT ME TO ASK 
QUESTIONS AND ALSO TO EVALUATE 
EVIDENCE WHEN IT COMES TO MEDIUMS 
WHO CLAIM TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE 
WITH THE DEAD I AM SCEPTICAL SO 
ARE THEY DELUDED OR AM I MISSING 
SOMETHING TO FIND OUT LET'S GO FOR 
A LITTLE TRIP TO THE OTHER SIDE 
MEDIUMSHIP HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
ENORMOUSLY POPULAR ARTHUR CONAN 
DOYLE WAS A FAN THE U. K.'S MOST 
FAMOUS MEDIUM WAS DORIS STOKES 
AND TODAY ACCESS TO PSYCHICS AND 
MEDIUMS IS ONLY A CLICK AWAY 
THROUGH THE WORLDWIDE WEB BUT WHY 
DO WE LOVE IT SO MUCH 
IT TELLS US 
AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT WHAT WE SEE AS 
BEING OUR PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE IT 
ADDRESSES SOME OF OURD FUNDAMENTAL 
FEARS IN PARTICULAR WE ARE ALL 
TERIFIED OF OUR OWN MORTALITY AND 
OF THE IDEA THAT OUR LOVED ONES 
WILL DIE AND THAT WILL BE THE END 
OF THEM WE ARE COMFORTED IF 
SOMEONE TELLS US THAT'S NOT THE 
CASE THAT WE WILL SURVIVE BUT BUT SOMETHING THE VULNERABLE ARE SOME 
THINK THE VULNERABLE ARE BEING 
TAKEN FOR A RIDE DAVID ANDERSON 
WORKS UNDERCOVER SEEKING AND 
EXPOSING FRAUDSTERS TO DO HIS WORK 
HE REQUIRES ANONYMITY WHAT'S YOUR 
EXPERIENCE OF THESE MEDIUMS 
EXPERIENCE SPANSA NUMBER OF YEARS 
NOW THE MOST RECENT READING WAS 
ABOUT YEAR HALF HALF BEING GOING 
TOLD NOT TO BUY ORANGE CARPETS 
THROUGH GREAT GREAT GRANDMA 
BASIC RUBBISH 
DO YOU THINK THE 
INDUSTRY NEEDS REGULATION 
ABSOLUTELY EVER SINCE IT'S BEEN 
GOING THEY'VE CHOSEN TO REGULATE 
THEMSELVES ALMOST THE FOX IS IN 
CHARGE OF THE FOXES THERE COULD BE 
MANY WHO GENUINELY BELIEVE THEY ARE 
TALKING TO THE DEAD I ALSO THINK 
PROBABLY THE SAME AMOUNT GENUINELY 
BELIEVE IT'S GOD WAY OF EARNING 
MONEY FOR DOING VERY LITTLE BUT BUT WHAT DOES THE OTHER SIDE HAVE TO 
SAY I HAVE COME TO THE TRAINING 
COLLEGE FOR SPIRITUALIST AND 
MEDIUMS TO MEET A TRUE BELIEVER I I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THIS FOR 
WELL OVER THIRTY YEARS L. DON'T BELIEVE 
I AM DELUDED L. THINK I AM VERY 
STABLE MINDED I SEE PEOPLE WHO 
SUFFER FROM SOMETHING CALLED GRIEF 
IF WE CAN REUNITE THEM WITH THEIR 
LOVED ONES THEN WE ARE PROVIDING A 
SERVICE TO SOCIETY 
DO YOU ACCEPT 
THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE 
PROBABLY EXPLOITING THE WEAK 
ABSOLUTELY IT'S A BASIC HUMAN 
NATURE NO MATTER WHAT WALK OF LIFE 
ONE MAN DOES ONE THING ANOTHER MAN 
WILL TRY TO EXPLOIT IT MEDIUMSHIP 
IS NO DIFFERENT WE HAVE CODE OF 
PRACTICE IF THEY DON'T MEET THOSE 
STANDARDS WE CAN STRIKE THEM OFF 
DO YOU FIND THIS NOTION OF CHATTING 
WITH THE DEAD DO YOU FIND THIS 
PERFECTLY NORMAL 
WHY ISN'T IT 
BECAUSE THEY'RE DEAD 
WHEN PEOPLE 
MAKE THE ULTIMATE JOURNEY IN LIFE 
WE CALL DEATH WHY DO WE THINK IT'S 
STRANGE THEY WANT TO CALL US UP AND 
SAY I AM O. K. WE STILL LOVE YOU 
HAVE HAVE HAVE YOU EVER HAD A 
SITTING WITH A GOOD CERTIFIED 
MEDIUM 
I BELIEVE I AM GOING TO MEDIUM SHORTLY I AM GOING TO YOUR DAD TO SHORTLY COME CLOSER TO US I AM AWARE OF 
YOUR DAD HERE L. AM AWARE OF HIS 
PRESENCE HE IS A SOLITARY FIGURE 
LIKES TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOW BUT 
HE IS SMILING AT YOU YOU L. AM 
GOING TO ASK YOUR DAD TO STEP TO 
ONE SIDE WHILE I SEE IF THERE IS 
ANYBODY ELSE THERE FOR YOU YOUR 
MOTHER HAS TWO RINGS THAT BELONG TO 
YOUR GRANDMOTHER AS WELL 
WELL THAT WAS EXTREMELY 
INTERESTING I THOUGHT SHE WAS 
LOVELY WOMAN AND CLEARLY SINCERE 
SHE DID CORRECTLY IDENTIFY THE FACT 
THAT MY DAD IS DEAD BUT HER 
CHARACTER READING OF MY DAD WAS NOT 
VERY ACCURATE SHE DID ALSO MAKE 
COUPLE OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS WHICH I 
AM GOING TO GO AND CHECK OUT NOW 
AS OF NOW MY SCEPTICISM IS SHAKEN 
BUT NOT REALLY STIRRED 
JAMES SCEPTICISM IS NOT SHAKEN OR 
STIRRED YOU REMAIN A COMPLETE 
SCEPTIC 
YES BASED UPON EVIDENCE I SCEPTIC HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER OVER THE 
LAST THIRTY YEARS 
YOU HAVEN'T FOUND 
ANY EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING 
IN IT 
I AM WILLING TO BE SHOWN I 
AM A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF 
WILLING TO BE SHOWN 
TO BE SPECIFICS THIS IS MILLION 
DOLLARS OF YOUR CASH YOU ARE 
PUTTING PEOPLE TO THE TEST IF THEY 
CAN PROVE SOMETHING THE CASH IS 
THEIRS 
THE OFFER IS OUT THERE ALL THEIRS THEY HAVE TO DO IS APPLY COME AND 
DO IT AND WALK AWAY WITH A MILLION 
DOLLARS 
I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE DOLLARS BEEN TO A SEANCE AND BEEN 
FRIGHTENED AND THOUGHT THERE IS 
SOMETHING IN IT AND IT'S BEEN 
TERRIFYING FOR THEM IS THERE SOME 
SKULLDUGGERY TRICKERY IN MAKING 
THINGS HAPPEN 
IT DEPENDS ON THE 
SEANCE SOME PEOPLE ONLY DO IT BY 
SUGGESTION SOME PEOPLE DO IT BY 
PHYSICAL GIMMICKS AND THAT CAN BE 
DONE VERY EASILY 
CAN YOU 
DEMONSTRATE 
WELL YES THEY DEMONSTRATE BROUGHT A WHOLE BUNCH OF CUTLERY 
HERE THESE ARE SPOONS WHERE DID 
THESE SPOONS COME FROM DO WE KNOW 
B. B. C. CANTEEN 
FROM ANOTHER 
CONTINUEIUM 
HOLD ON TO THE SPOON CONTINUEIUM LIKE THAT ALL RIGHT NOW I AM 
GOING TO STROKE IT GENTLY LIKE THIS 
ALL RIGHT L. WANT YOU LOOK 
AT THIS 
DON'T HOLD IT TOO TIGHTLY VERY 
LOITLY LOOK AT THIS IT'S GETTING 
FLEXIBLE AND IT'S BROKEN IN TWO 
PIECES A MIRACLE 
HE IS GOOD IS IS THIS URI GELLER 
I COULD GO THROUGH 
ALL THE CULT LETTERY IF YOU 
CUTLERY IF YOU WANT 
MICHAEL YOU ARE STILL NOT CONVINCED 
IF A MEDIUM DOES COME UP WITH FACTS 
AND FIGURES ABOUT YOUR LIFE THAT 
THEY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE KNOWN 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT 
THEY GET A 
MILLION DOLLARS IT'S THAT SIMPLE 
THEY DO COME UP WITH FACTS YOUR 
MOTHER IS LOOKING OVER YOUR 
SHOULDER SHE IS STANDING THERE IN 
SPIRIT AND SHE IS SMILING AT YOU 
SHE WAS A VERY NICE LADY WHAT 
ELSE YOUR MOTHER WAS AN EVIL 
WOMAN SHE DID TERRIBLE THINGS TO 
YOU THROUGH YOUR LIFE I DON'T 
THINK SO 
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT 
ALL 
I ENJOYED THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE ALL IT WAS STRANGE L. DIDN'T EMERGE 
CONVINCED BUT WHAT HAPPENED IS SHE 
MADE TWO SPECIFIC CLAIMS ONE OF 
WHICH WAS THAT MY GRANDMOTHER HAD 
PASSED ON TO MY MOTHER TWO RINGS 
AND A A BROOCH I RANG MY MOTHER 
AND SHE SAID YES INDEED SHE HAD 
DID YOU ASK HER WHAT DID SHE LEAVE 
YOU RATHER THAN DID SHE LEAVE YOU 
TWO RINGS AND A BROOCH 
I REMAINED 
SCEPTICAL BUT I WAS CURIOUS 
NIGEL WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT NOT NOT A LOT I TELL YOU IT'S AMAZING 
THAT SPOON TRICK 
THAT'S NOTHING 
THAT WASN'T YOUR OWN BREAKABLE 
SPOON YOU BROUGHT IN

WORK ON HERE AS A VIOLINIST THE THE ARTWORK ON THE COVER VERY HARD 
WORK 
WORK WORK YOU LOOK A BIT STOOPED ON THERE I I AM TRYING TO MAKE MY WAY UP THOSE 
MOUNTAINS MOUNTAINS DOCTOR WHO TELL US HOW THIS CAME ABOUT 
THERE WAS THIS LAUNCH OF LIKE THE 
PROMS WHICH THEY'VE GOT A VERY 
EXCITING LINE UP THIS YEAR AND OH 
MAN IT'S BETTER FROM WHEN I WAS A 
KID ANYWAY BUT LIKE I FELT WHY 
NOT GET UP THERE AND PLAY SOMETHING 
BECAUSE THEY WANTED ME TO POSE LIKE 
A WALLY IN FRONT OF THE ALBERT HALL 
I SAID YOU HAVE DOCTOR WHO ON THAT 
GIVE ME A CHANCE TO PLAY IT IT'S 
ONE OF THIS IS MELODY EVERYONE 
KNOWS IT'S ICONIC NOW WE 
KNOWS HAVE YOU IN WITHOUT HAVING A LOOK 
AT YOUR HAIR IT'S STOOD THE TEST 
OF TIME WHAT A BARNET YOU HAVE A 
CLASSIC LOOK HAVE YOU EVER MESSED 
WITH IT 
I DON'T WASH IT WITH SOAP 
FOR LIKE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS SOMETHING SOMETHING IS MAKING IT STICK UP 
IT'S NOT A 
HABIT OF HYGIENE 
THE SUBJECT OF HAIR IS ONE THAT 
OBSESSES US WHEN WE HAVE IT WE 
WORRY ABOUT HOW IT LOOKS AND WHEN 
WE HAVEN'T GOT IT WE WISH WE HAD 
DOCTOR JARVIS SAYS IT'S A PROBLEM NOT 
TO BE BRUSHED ASIDE 
MANY OF US CAN'T PUT PRICE ON 
OUR HAIR IT'S OUR PRIDE AND JOY 
THROUGHOUT HISTORY IT'S BEEN 
SYMBOL OF HEALTH INDIVIDUALALITY 
AND ATTRACTIVENESS WHAT IS THE 
MOST YOU HAVE EVER SPENT ON HAIRCUT SEVENTY FIVE THIRTY THREE FORTY FIVE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX HAIRCUT SEVENTY FIVE THIRTY THREE FORTY FIVE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THAT'S LOT SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY 
IMPORTANT HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU 
FEEL 
MAKES ME FEEL REALLY GOOD L. FEEL I THINK YOUR HAIR IS YOUR BEAUTY 
WOMEN IN BRITAIN SPENT ROUGHLY 
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND ON THEIR HAIR THROUGHOUT 
THEIR LIVES EVEN MEN MEN SPEND 
ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND 
HOW MUCH DO WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT 
OUR HAIR I'M MEETING LEADING 
DERMATOLOGIST DOCTOR DAVID FENTON 
HAIR IS VERY IMPORTANT EMOTIONALLY 
IT'S THE CROWNING GLORY IT'S NOT 
UNUSUAL FOR PEOPLE TO GET VERY 
UPSET WHEN THEY LOSE HAIR PROBABLY 
THE MOST POWERFUL SOCIAL STATEMENT 
YOU CAN MAKE THE LENGTH COLOUR 
AND STYLE 
WHAT ARE THE THE 
COMMONEST MISTAKES YOU SEE PEOPLE 
MAKING 
THE COMMONEST PROBABLY IS MAKING OVERTREATING AND THAT MEANS NOTIOUS 
CHEMICALS BUT ALSO HEAT BECAUSE 
HAIR DRIES OUT VERY QUICKLY AND THE 
MODERN TREND FOR STRAIGHTENERS 
DRIES OUT HAIR SEVERELY MOST 
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS 
GOING ON THE GROWTH PHASE OF THE 
HAIR CYCLE IS DETERMINED 
GENETICALLY AND IF YOU HAVE A SHORT 
GROWTH PHASE SAY ONE YEAR YOU 
WOULD NEVER ACHIEVE HAIR LENGTH 
MAYBE GREATER THAN SHOULDER LENGTH 
IF YOU HAVE SIX YEARS' GROWTH PHASE 
YOU COULD GROW HAIR TO SIT ON 
KELLY COULD HAVE HAIR AS LONG AS 
RAP PUN ZEL IF SHE FANCIED IT WHAT 
IS THE BEST WAY TO LOOK AFTER IT 
WHAT YOU EAT IS VITAL AND THE 
PROTEIN INTAKE FIRST CLASS DAIRY 
EGGS FISH POULTRY AND RED AND 
WHITE MEAT IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL BY BY THE TIME PEOPLE COME TO SEE ME AS A 
G. P. THEY'VE SPENT MONTHS AND 
THOUSANDS AT PRIVATE HAIR CLINICS 
THE FIRST STOP MUST BE YOUR OWN 
FAMILY DOCTOR IT'S VERY SIMPLE TO 
CARRY OUT SERIES OF BLOOD TESTS 
TO CHECK EVEN TO MAKE A DIAGNOSIS 
JUST ON APPEARANCE 
THE TRUTH IS 
THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR HAIR 
LOSS SO IF YOU ARE WORRIED MAKE 
SURE YOU GET A PROPER DIAGNOSIS WE 
ARE JOINED BY ONE OF THE U. K.'S TOP 
TRICHOLOGIST SHE IS GOING TO 
ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS CAN WE HAVE 
SOME APPROPRIATE MUSIC THAT WOULD 
BE THE BARBER OF SEVILLE DOES DOES BEING GINGER PUT ME AT A HAIR 
DISADVANTAGE 
NO MOST CERTAINLY DISADVANTAGE LOT YOU HAVE LOVELY HAIR SARAH 
HAS LOVELY HAIR RED HEADS HAVE 
KOORSTER HAIR AND BECAUSE OF THAT 
PERHAPS YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE 
PRODUCTS YOU ARE USING YOU MAYBE 
NEED A BIT MORE REMOISTURISING IN 
THE HAIR 
IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR I WAS 
COPPER NOBODY AND GINGER AND I 
THOUGHT WHEN I GROW UP 
IT'S A 
PSYCHIATRIST YOU NEED NOW WHY MY 
BROTHER HAS GONE FROM GINGER TO 
GREY WHICH SEEMS UNFAIR THERE 
SHOULD BE AN INTERMEDIATE STAGE ONE I WAS TOLD YOU WENT WHITE BECAUSE IT 
IS THE MIXTURE OF THE DARK AND 
WHITE HAIR 
YOU SEE ALL KINDS OF 
VARIATIONS ALONG THE WAY IT 
DEPENDS ON THE RATE AT WHICH YOU 
LOSE YOUR PIGMENTATION 
I HAVEN'T 
GONE BALD YET WILL I YES I'M YES I'M GOING TO PUT MY GLASSES ON L. THINK 
YOU ARE IN WITH PRETTY GOOD 
CHANCE OF KEEPING YOUR HAIR WHAT WHAT GOVERNS THAT IS IT YOUR MOTHER'S 
FATHER'S MOTHER'S BROTHER 
CAN IS 
BROWN EYES BLUE EYES IT IS 
GENETICALLY INHERITED GENETIC WE 
ARE TALKING ABOUT GENETIC HAIR LOSS 
AND USUALLY IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH 
THINNER BY THIS AGE NOT THAT I'M 
MAKING MAKING ANY STATEMENT HERE 
HE'S NEARLY SIXTY 
IT WAS INTERESTING 
BECAUSE WE WERE TALKING TO JAMES 
AND TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE 
HAS LOST HIS SCALP HAIR IN A 
CLASSICAL WAY BUT HE HAS THAT 
AMAZING BEARD 
WHAT ABOUT FEMALE 
BALDNESS THAT IS INCREASINGLY 
SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE 
IT'S A HUGE 
PROBLEM IT IS WHAT I SEE EVERY DAY 
THAT IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE 
FACE NOW AND THERE ARE GOOD 
TREATMENTS FOR IT BUT IT IS A BIG 
ISSUE 
THANK YOU THAT IS A WEIGHT ISSUE OFF MY MIND 
I HAVE GOT A QUESTION 
FOR YOU HOW OLD ARE YOU BABY DOCTOR 
A FRIEND OF A FRIEND POSSIBLY A 
VILLA FAN HAS A RIGHT BAD CASE OF 
THE KNITS WHAT CAN WHAT CAN HE 
DO ABOUT IT 
THEY ARE EASY TO GET 
RID OF BUT THEY ARE A REAL PROBLEM 
THE RECURRENCE IS A HUGE PROBLEM 
IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THEM YOU MUST 
TREAT THEM TREAT THEM USE A 
TREATMENT FOR THEM WHICH YOU CAN 
EASILY GET FROM YOUR LOCAL CHEMIST 
BUT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS WOULD WOULD YOU STAND SO CLOSE TO A GUY WHO IS 
SUFFERING FROM THAT 
THEY DON'T 
LEAP HEAD TO HEAD CONTACT IF IF THEY HAVE LEAPING KNITS 
YOU WOULD 
BE IN BIG TROUBLE 
WE CAN CHECK OF 
THIS BARNET JUST GO IN L. THINK 
IT'S BEEN ATTRACTED BY CAN WE 
HAVE A LOOK AT THAT HE'S BEEN 
ATTRACTED BY INJURE VIOLIN PLAYING 
I LOVE NIGEL IT'S A KNOWN FACT OF 
COURSE THAT FROGS AND TOADS ARE 
HOPELESS AS CROSSING THE ROAD 
UNLIKE THE CHICKEN THEY RARELY GET 
TO THE OTHER SIDE IN ONE PIECE 
MORE OF THESE SIGNS ARE POPPING UP 
BUT SOME TOAD LOVERS WANT TO DO 
MORE THAN STICK UP SIGNS OUR MAN 
MIKE DILGER HAS JOINED THEM ON TOAD 
PATROL SEA SAND SURFING THAT IS 
WHY PEOPLE LOVE TO COME TO THE 
NORTH DEVON COAST BUT TODAY I'LL 
NOT BE PUTTING ON A WET SUIT 
BECAUSE THE CREATURE I'M AFTER 
PREFERS FRESH WATER IT'S A BEAST 
THAT ONLY COMES OUT UNDER THE COVER 
OF DARKNESS AND IT'S THE COMMON 
TOAD 
PEOPLE OFTEN THINK TOADS LIVE IN 
WATER WHEN ACTUALLY THEY SPEND TEN 
MONTHS OF THE YEAR ON LAND BUT 
WHEN LOVE IS IN THE THE AIR THEY 
HEAD BACK TO WATER TO BREED THIS 
IS THEIR FINAL DESTINATION THEIR 
BREEDING GROUNDS L. CAN'T SEE ANY 
SIGN OF TOAD SPAWN JUST YET BUT I 
HAVE THIS FUNNY FEELING THEY'RE ON 
THEIR WAY TOADS HIBERNATE ALL 
WINTER BUT DURING FEBRUARY AND 
MARCH THEY WAKE UP AND UNDER COVER 
OF DARKNESS MIGRATE BACK TO THE 
PONDS THEY WERE BORN IN TOADS ARE 
PRETTY SINGLE MINDED AND THEY WILL 
CROSS ANY OBSTACLE THAT GETS IN 
THEIR WAY INCLUDING OUR ROADS 
IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT TWENTY TONNES 
OF TOADS ARE KILLED BY CARS EVERY 
SINGLE YEAR 
FORTUNATELY THESE TOADS HAVE FOUND 
THEIR SAVIOUR IN TRACING BERRIDGE 
TRACEY WHAT IS THE THE PLAN OF 
ACTION TONIGHT 
WE ARE GOING TO GO 
DOWN THE LANE AND LOOK ALONG THE 
SIDE OF THE ROAD AND PICK UP 
HOPEFULLY A LOT OF TOADS 
DO THEY 
LIKE WIND 
NOT AS MUCH AS WE DO 
IT'S WE ARE BEING BLOWN DOWN THE 
ROAD IT'S A MASSIVE COLONY IT'S IT'S THE THIRD LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY 
WE GET AROUND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR WOW WOW I KNOW NOT BAD 
GOT ONE 
AND ANOTHER 
ONE 
WE HAVE GOT OUR FIRST TWO ONE BRILLIANT LOOK AT THAT THERE WE 
GO THE COMMON TOAD JUST IN TIME 
BECAUSE THERE IS A CAR COMING DOES 
IT FEEL GOOD TO HAVE SAVED TWO 
LIVES THERE YES L. DON'T SEE ANY YES I DON'T SEE ANY TOADS BUT I SEE A BUCKET AND LIGHT 
THAT IS MARK ONE OF THE LIGHT PATROL MY HUSBAND 
IS HE NOW 
ANOTHER TOAD LOVER HOW IS IT 
GOING 
QUITE A FEW 
LOOK AT THAT GOING THEY ARE QUITE NOISY 
IT IS L. I THINK THERE IS A BIT OF MISCHIEF 
GOING ON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
BUCKET 
YEAH THERE IS 
IS THE BUCKET SMALLER MALE ON TOP YES 
WHY ARE YES THEY CLIMBING ON BOARD 
SO THEY CAN 
STAY WITH THE FEMALE UNTIL THEY GET 
TO THE POND 
A BIT LAZY YEAH YEAH TYPICAL MALE 
ANOTHER ONE TO ADD TO THE 
COLLECTION IS THERE A SET TIME 
THAT THEY COME OUT 
THEY COME OUT 
MORE AT DUSK AND CROSS RIGHT 
THROUGH THE EARLY HOURS OF THE 
MORNING 
YOU MUST HAVE A NOCTURNAL MORNING LIFESTYLE 
YEAH NO LIFE THEY CAN LIFESTYLE TRAVEL AROUND A MILE AND A HALF A A LONG WALK 
OR HITCHING A RIDE IF 
THEY ARE A MALE 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU 
BEEN DOING THE PATROL 
AROUND THIRTEEN 
YEARS 
IN THIRTEEN YEARS YOU MUST HAVE YEARS SAVED A LOT OF TOADS 
OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

HONOUR FOR SERVICES TO THE 
AMPHIBIAN COMMUNITY LET'S GO AND
