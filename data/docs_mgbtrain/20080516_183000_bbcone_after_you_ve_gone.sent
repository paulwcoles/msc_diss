WHAT ABOUT A TRANSFER 
I'VE THOUGHT OF THAT BUT WHAT FAMILY WOULD HAVE YOU 
DAD GRAN WON'T LET ME HAVE THE TATTOO EVEN THOUGH YOU SAID I COULD

A TATTOO MAY BE THE SORT OF YOUTHFUL IDIOCY YOUR FATHER MIGHT EXCUSE AS FREE EXPRESSION 
BUT I WON'T STAND FOR IT 
COME ON DIANA YOU CAN'T TELL ME YOU NEVER DID ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHEN YOU WERE MOLLY'S AGE 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT

I THOUGHT THAT WAS A BIRTH MARK 
SO WHAT IS IT A UNICORN A FLAMING SKULL 
SIR ANTHONY EDEN 
DO YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU AGAIN NO DIANA I'LL PAY YOU NOT TO 
SO HAS THE JURY REACHED A VERDICT ON THE TATTOO YET 
THEY'RE STILL DECIDING 
AS YOUR ACCOUNTANT I'D ADVISE YOU TO FORGO THE BODY ART 
AND PUT THE MONEY INTO A HIGH INTEREST RETIREMENT ACCOUNT 
ESTIMATING CONSERVATIVELY A RETURN OF FIFTY FIVE PER CENT OVER THE NEXT FORTY YEARS 
OH MY GOD I'M SO BORING 
NO MORE BORING THAN USUAL 
M. M. M. SO DIANA HAS A TATTOO 
I MUST ADMIT IT'S NICE TO KNOW YOU'RE NOT SO PERFECT 
I NEVER SAID I WAS PERFECT YOU HAVE REPEATEDLY 
THE POINT IS WE ALL DO STUPID THINGS WHEN WE'RE YOUNG 
I REMEMBER WHEN MY DAUGHTER MARRIED YOU 
IT'S THE FLAMING SKULL ISN'T IT 
IF YOU MUST KNOW IT'S A ROSE 
A ROSE SO IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR YOU TO HAVE A TATTOO BUT NOT FOR MOLLY 
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU 
I DON'T WANT MOLLY TO GET A TATTOO EITHER BUT HOW CAN WE STOP HER 
IF I TELL HER NOT TO DO SOMETHING SHE JUST DOES IT ALL THE MORE 
WE COULD MAKE THAT WORK FOR US 
A BIT OF REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY 
BRILLIANT MOLLY DEAR 
GOOD NEWS WE'VE TALKED IT OVER AND 
WE THINK YOU SHOULD GET THE TATTOO 
WHATEVER YOU WANT WE'RE ALL FOR IT IN FACT HAVE TWO 
OH GREAT THANK YOU 
MOLLY COULD YOU GIVE US ANOTHER MOMENT 
HOW MANY MOMENTS DO YOU NEED 
THAT ISN'T QUITE WHAT I MEANT 
WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST TRY BEING HONEST 
TELL MOLLY ABOUT YOUR FLORAL DISPLAY 
FINE MOLLY 
LOOK WHAT SEEMS COOL TO YOU NOW MAY NOT SEEM AS COOL TO YOU IN TEN YEARS 
EVEN LESS IN THIRTY YEARS 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT WHEN I WAS YOUNG I GOT A TATTOO 
IT'S A ROSE 
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE A MISTAKE THAT I'VE REGRETTED EVERY DAY SINCE 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU YEAH
