HELLO WELCOME TO AUGUSTA FOR THE 
FINAL DAY'S PLAY OF THE SEVENTY SECOND 
MASTERS LATER THIS EVENING 
SOMEONE WILL MAKE THE SHORT DRIVE 
DOWN MAGNOLIA LANE CLUTCHING THE 
MOST PRIZED ITEM OF CLOTHING IN 
WORLD SPORT THE GREEN JACKET 
THE FINAL DAY'S PLAY OF THE MASTERS 
NEVER FAILS TO PRODUCE MEMORABLE 
MOMENTS AND A REAL DRAMA L. AM SURE THIS ONE WILL NOT DISAPPOINT PAUL CASEY WAS WELL PLACED TIGER 
WOODS WAS BIDDING TO WIN HIS FIRST 
MAJOR COMING FROM BEHIND ON THE 
FINAL DAY A PLETHORA OF PLAYERS 
WERE AT MINUS TWO IT WOULD TAKE SOMETHING 
VERY SPECIAL FOR ANY OF THESE TWO 
FEATURE BUT YOU NEVER KNOW 
AFTER THE RAIN AND HUMID CONDITIONS 
YESTERDAY THE PLAYERS FACE A 
DIFFERENT CHALLENGE TODAY CLEAR 
BLUE SKIES ACCOMPANIED BY AN EVER 
STIFFENING BREEZE THIS BEAUTIFUL 
GOLF COURSE OF AUGUSTA COULD WELL 
SHOW ITS TEETH TODAY 
THIS WAS TREVOR IMMELMAN ON THE 
FIRST TEE JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO THE OPENING TEE SHOT OF TREVOR 
IMMELMAN A TOUGH BREEZY DAY 
BOUND TO BE A LITTLE NERVOUS A LONG WAY DOWN THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IT WILL BE A TOUGH DAY 
HE DROPPED OUT OF THE TREES TO HERE 
THIS IS HIS THIRD SHOT AT THE PAR 
FOUR FIRST HOLE O. K. HE HAS BEEN HACKING AT THIS FIRST HOLE THIS IS LIVE NOW LET'S BRING YOU 
RIGHT UP TO SPEED TREVOR IMMELMAN 
IN TROUBLE AT THE FIRST BRANDT 
SNEDEKER IS PLAYING ALONGSIDE HIM 
A PAR AT THE FIRST FOR STEVE FLESCH 
AND PAUL CASEY TIGER WOODS TOO 
SHE WOULD SING HAD AN EARLY BIRDIE 
A COUPLE OF BIRDIES FOR PADRAIG 
HAMILTON STEWART CINK HAD AN 
EARLY BIRDIE LEE WESTWOOD HAD AN EARLY BIRDIE 
BUT HAS DROPPED ONE SO HE IS BACK 
WHERE HE STARTED RETIEF GOOSEN AND 
PHIL MICKELSON HAVE DROPPED A SHOT 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMINEZ GOING WELL 
TODAY THREE UNDER FOR THE DAY NICK DOUGHERTY HAD A DOUBLE BOGEY 
ASIDE FROM THAT HE WAS GOING ALONG 
QUITE STEADILY HEATH SLOCUM IN WITH THE FIRST 
SCORE UNDER SEVENTY TODAY A SIXTY NINE FOR THE 
AMERICAN IAN WOOSNAM AND SANDY LYLE JUST 
HAPPY TO MAKE THE CUT WE CAN JOIN 
BRANDT SNEDEKER FOR HIS THIRD SHOT A PRETTY GOOD TEE SHOT BUT A SHORT 
ONE AND THIS HAS DRIFTED AWAY DOWN 
THE RIGHT A BIT 
OF A NERVOUS START FOR BOTH OF THEM 
YES THAT IS TO BE 
EXPECTED A TOUGH DAY WINDY BOTH 
BOYS STRUGGLING FOR PAR IT JUST 
MAKES IT ALL THE MORE EXCITING IT 
BRINGS THE FIELD TIGHTER TOGETHER NEARLY A 
YARD TO THE LEFT OR A YARD FURTHER IT WOULD HAVE 
GOVERNED THE BALL TO THE HOLE A 
PAR AT THE FIRST FOR TIGER WOODS 
IT WOULD HAVE GATHERED THE BALL 
THERE YOU CAN SEE HOW STRONG THE 
WIND IS 
JOINING US ALONGSIDE THE FIRST 
FAIRWAY WE HAVE GOT WAYNE GRADY 
AND PETER ALLISS AS ALWAYS IT IS 
A TESTING START FOR THE LEADERS 
YES IT WILL BE TODAY IT WILL BE 
SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY WE HAVE 
THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE LEADING THE 
WAY OH SEVEN AND TWENTY EIGHT AND IT WILL BE 
FASCINATING TO SEE HOW THEY COPE 
BECAUSE TREVOR IMMELMAN HAS BEEN 
AROUND FOR TEN OR ELEVEN YEARS AND 
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE QUITE CLOSE IN 
AGE IT IS LIKE LOOKING AT SOMEONE 
WHO HAS BEEN UP FOR COUPLE OF 
AWARDS AND THE OTHER LAD IS JUST 
STARTING OUT LEARNING COLLEGE THEY BOTH HAVE LONG PUTTS AT PAR 
FOR THE FIRST 
YES THEY MISSED 
LEFT AND RIGHT THIS IS TREVOR 
IMMELMAN FOR HIS PAR GOODNESS ME 
HE STILL HAS GOT A TESTER TO COME 
FOR HIS BOGEY THE WIND WILL BLOW 
TODAY I KNOW THEY WOULD HAVE 
PREFERRED TO HAVE A LIGHT BREEZE 
LIKE IT WAS FOR THE FIRST THREE 
DAYS 
IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR TREVOR DAYS IMAM AND THAT HE HOLES 
THAT TREVOR A MOMENT THAT HE HOLES THAT THIS WAS PADRAIG HAMILTON'S BIRDIE AT THE THIRD THE OPEN CHAMPION STARTING WELL BRANDT SNEDEKER LINING UP HIS PUTT HE PLAYED VERY WELL YESTERDAY I 
LIKE THE WAY HE DID IT HE LOST A 
FEW SHOTS AT THE START OF THE BACK 
NINE AND CAME BACK WITH SOME MAKE 
BIRDIES HE CAME BACK A VERY WELL 
SO I AM LOOKING FOR HIM TO DO 
SOMETHING TODAY 
BUT TODAY IT IS A 
VERY DIFFERENT DAY FROM YESTERDAY 
THE EXTRA PRESSURE THE THOUGHT 
THAT YOU'RE COMING TO THE END OF 
THE TOURNAMENT 
THERE WILL BE SADNESS AND JOY THERE WILL BE MUCH TO WATCH AND SAY 
THAT AND FEEL SORRY FOR AND ELATED 
FOR THIS IS WHERE GOLF IS SO 
AMAZING IT IS FOR THE BIRDIE 
PEDESTRIAN BUT THEY CAN BE SO MUCH 
DRAMA 
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF KEY DRAMA MOMENTS BUT THERE IS ONE COMING UP 
HERE 
THAT IS ONE BOGEY ONE BOGEY HERE FOR BRANDT SNEDEKER SO HE DROPS 
BACK TO EIGHT UNDER TREVOR 
IMMELMAN NOW FOR HIS BOGEY 
OVER TO 
THE COMMENTARY TEAM HE PLAYED BEAUTIFULLY THE VERY FIRST HOLE THE LAST ROUND IT REALLY TESTY ONE HERE FOR BOGEY EIGHT REALLY TESTY ONE A REALLY TESTY ONE SOLID WELL DONE IT IS A BOGEY BUT HE WILL NOT FEEL TOO BADLY 
CONDITIONS ON DIFFERENT TODAY AND 
KEN HAS BEEN OUT ON THE COURSE TO 
CHECK THEM OUT 
THERE IS NOTHING QUITE LIKE IT ON 
A SUNDAY MORNING FOR THE FINAL 
ROUND OF THE AUGUSTA NATIONAL THE 
COURSE IS PERFECT AS YOU WOULD 
EXPECT 
THE CUP HAS HARDLY BEEN CUT IT HAS 
ALMOST BEEN LASER CUT THE SHOP AND 
CRISP WITH A BIT OF WHITE PAINT 
AROUND IT READY FOR THE FIRST TRIP 
TO COME ROUND THE YELLOW FLAG 
ALWAYS STANDS OUT THEN YOU HAVE 
GOT THE TWO CUTS OF FRINGE A QUARTER OF AN INCH LONG THEN THE 
LONGER FRINGE THEN THE BUNKERS 
LOOK AT THEM WE SAW A CHAP 
YESTERDAY WITH THIS IS AS OUT ON 
THE EDGE IT IS QUITE MAGNIFICENT 
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT THE 
AZALEAS ARE OUT THE PINE TREES ARE 
OUT IT LOOKS MAGNIFICENT THE 
CROWDS OF GATHERING IT REALLY IS 
THE PLACE TO BE SO LET'S GET READY 
TO RUMBLE 
IT IS GREAT TO HAVE DAVID BELLAMY 
WORKING FOR US SORRY ABOUT THAT THIS WILL BE VERY CLOSE THE 
STEWART CINK BIRDIED THE FIRST AND 
A GREAT CHANCE OF BIRDIE AT THE SECOND IT WILL STICK A POOR ONE FROM 
TIGER WOODS INCHES AWAY WITH THE 
SECOND SHOT THE GREENS ARE VERY FAST BUT I 
HAVE SEEN THEM FASTER ON THE FINAL 
DAY SWIFT BUT NOT AS FAST AS THEY 
COULD BE BUT THERE ARE ONLY TWO 
HOLES ON THE FRONTLINE THAT ARE 
AVERAGING UNDER PAR YOU HAVE GOT TO PICK UP YOUR CHANCES ON THE LONG HOLES NOT QUITE AS QUICK AS THIS IS FROM THE LEFT OF THE HOLE REASONABLY AGGRESSIVE HERE TIGER WOODS WILL STOP WE HAVE SEEN HIM TO READ WITH A 
SWING WITH THE DRIVER BUT NOT WITH 
THE PUTTER SOMETHING DISTRACTED 
HIM MAYBE NOT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SURE OF THE 
LINE OF THE AUGUSTA WIND YOU CAN SEE HIS TROUSERS FLAPPING THERE KNOW THAT IS UNUSUAL A DOWNWIND 
PAR FIVE NO BIRDIE FROM TIGER 
WOODS IT SHOULD BE A PAR PAR 
START PAUL CASEY AND STEVE FLESCH 
STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
FAIRWAY WAITING FOR THE GREEN YOU 
WANT TO TRY AND GET IT IN BETWEEN 
THE BUNKERS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE 
AND IT WILL CAMBER ROUND THE GREEN 
AND BACK A DREAM START BIRDIE BIRDIE JUST FOUR BEHIND THIS COURSE TODAY WILL TEST EVERY 
LITTLE BIT OF YOUR GOLFING ABILITY 
YOUR NERVE EVERY SINEW OF THAT I THINK THERE WILL BE ONE OR TWO 
SPOTS IN THE MORE EXPOSED GREENS 
WHERE THE BALL COULD PERHAPS GET 
BLOWN ABOUT ON 
THE BREEZE HE HAS WON A FAIR FEW MAJORS FROM THE FRONT THOUGH O. K. PAR PAR FOR 
TIGER WOODS NOT WHAT HE WAS 
LOOKING FOR KEN HAS BEEN LOOKING AT HOW TO MARK 
YOUR BALL ON THE GREEN 
WITH THE WIND EVER FRESHENING THE 
GREENS FAST THERE MAY BE FEW 
PROBLEMS TODAY WITH THE BALLS 
ROLLING ABOUT ON THE GREENS TO 
MARKET THE BALL IS NOT MARKED AND 
TO BE HAVE PICKED IT UP YOU HAVE 
GOT TO TRY AND GET IT TO REST ON 
THE SEVERE SLOPE WITH A BREEZY DAY 
YOU CAN PUT IT DOWN VERY EASILY 
AND IT CAN DRIFT OFF THE BALL IS 
NOW IN PLAY I CANNOT PUT IT BACK 
IT CAN WORK TO YOUR ADVANTAGE BUT 
WITH THE BREEZE GUSTING ABOUND WE 
MIGHT SEE SOME BALLS GUSTING ABOUT 
FINGERS CROSSED NOT BUT YOUR BALL 
IS NOT MARKED JUST BECAUSE THE BALL 
THE MARKET IS ON THE GROUND AN AN AWKWARD START FOR PAUL CASEY AN AWKWARD STANCE FOR PAUL CASEY THAT IS A LONG DIFFICULT BUNKER SHOT IT IS DOWNWIND DOWN HILL A BREEZY DAY A VERY ACCURATE PLAYER STEVE FLESCH NOT THE LONGEST BUT HE HAS HAD A LOT OF NEAT IRON SHOTS 
DEAR DEAR THAT WAS UNLUCKY SHOTS HE IS STRUGGLING A BIT ONE HUNDRED SEVEN IN THE 
WORLD 
LOTS OF ATTRACTIVE LOOKING PAIRINGS 
ON THE GOLF COURSE 
LOTS OF ATTRACTIVE LOOKING PAIRINGS ON THE GOLF COURSE 
IT'S THERE UP 
TO DATE SCORES ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF 
YOUR SCREEN IAN POULTER HAS JUST HAD A DOUBLE 
BOGEY AT THE FIFTH PADRAIG 
HAMILTON HAS STARTED REALLY WELL ZACH JOHNSON IS ONE UNDER PAR FOR THE 
DAY WE HAVE SEEN TIGER WOODS AND

WITH TWO BIRDIES THE LEFT HANDER 
STEVE FLESCH THEY ARE CURRENTLY 
PLAYING THE SECOND AND THE LEADER 
TREVOR IMMELMAN IT HAS TIGHTENED UP ALREADY AFTER 
TROUBLE IN NORMAN'S OPENING BOGEY 
AFTER TREVOR IMMELMAN'S OPENING 
BOGEY A DRIVER FOR TIGER WOODS AGGRESSIVE PLAYER BEAUTIFUL SWING STEVE WILLIAMS HIS CADDIE SAID IT 
WAS A BEAUTY HE IS WITHIN SEVENTY YARDS 
OF IT THE PERFECT SPOT LOOKING DOWN 
THE SECOND FAIRWAY THE HOLE SWEEPS TO THE LEFT THE 
BUNKER ON THE RIGHT IN PLAY JUST 
AT DRIVING DISTANCE IT REQUIRES A 
LITTLE DRAW GET GOOD ONE AWAY 
HERE AND YOU CAN DEFINITELY REACH 
THE GREEN ON TWO BUT IT IS EASY TO 
OVERDRAW IT HE HAS DRIVEN WELL BEAUTIFULLY 
THAT IS PERFECTION A LONG DRIVE 
RIGHT DOWN THE HILL A FOUR OR FIVE 
IRON FOR HIM THERE A TOUGH OPENING 
TEE SHOT HE JUST OVERDID IT ON THE 
FIRST JUST TRYING TO DRAW IT HE QUITE LIKES IT TWO PERFECT SHOTS TREVOR IMMELMAN 
HAS ONLY MISSED FOUR FAIRWAYS OVER 
THE OPENING THREE DAYS 
THE PUTTING 
WILL BE A HUGE CHALLENGE HERE IT 
NORMALLY IS BUT IT IS WINDY TODAY 
AND KEN HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE 
GREENS AND WAS STOPPED ALWAYS THE 
BIG TALKING POINT HERE THE PUTTING 
SURFACES SURFACES JUST HOW QUICK THEY ARE BUT WHAT 
OFTEN IS NOT SEEN ON T. V. IS THE 
MASSIVE SLOPES IF YOU GET IN THE 
WRONG SPOT ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS 
GETTING DOWN IN TWO THIS IS THE 
HIGH SIDE OF THIS GREEN WAY YOU DO 
NOT WANT TO BE BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO 
CHOOSE THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS TO 
GET TO THE CUP MUST BE FIFTY FEET 
AWAY LOOK AT HOW FAR I SWING THE 
PUTTER TO GET IT THAT DISTANCE 
THAT WILL HAVE GONE ABOUT THREE 
FEET ON NORMAL GREEN A BIT 
HIGHER NOW LET'S TRY IT A BIT MORE 
DIRECTLY LET'S SEE WHICH ONE GETS 
THE CLOSEST BUT LOOK AT THEM THAT 
ONE IS COMING IN DIFFERENT 
DIRECTION THIS ONE HAS ACCELERATED 
AWAY COME ON BABY THAT GIVES YOU 
AN IDEA OF THE PACE OF THE GREENS 
YOU GET IN THE WRONG SPOT AND WITH 
THE WIND IT WILL BE EASY TO DO 
THAT WAS NOT WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU 
ARE IN THREE PUTT COUNTRY HE CAN GET THIS ONE CLOSE UP THE 
LEFT SIDE OF THE GREEN AND IT WILL 
RELEASE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE PIN IT IS JUST MOVING A BIT FAST NOT TOO BAD STEVE FLESCH HIT A BEAUTIFUL SECOND 
SHOT HE HAS A REALLY TOUGH CHIP 
FROM OVER THE BACK THE FRONT PIN GATHERS THE BALL UP 
CLOSE TO IT FOR CHANCE OF A 
BIRDIE PHIL NICHOLSON STILL 
STRUGGLING BIT ON THE GREENS HE 
HAS GONE BACK TO ONE OF HIS OLD 
PUTTERS PHIL MICKELSON A DELICATE CHIP AND RUN A COUPLE 
OF BOUNCES THROUGH THE FRINGE JUST 
TRICKLE ON TO THE GREEN THE LAST THING HE WANTS TO DO IS 
LEAVE IT SHORT THIS IS GOOD IT 
SHOULD BE THAT IS AMAZING IT IS 
INTO THE WIND THE WIND IS HOLDING 
UP WINNING SCORE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO BE IN THE 
CLUBHOUSE AT EIGHT UNDER BUT WHO 
KNOWS PADRAIG HARRINGTON FOUR 
UNDER IT IS THE FIRST TIME HE HAS HAD A 
GOOD START TO THE ROUND TWO UNDER 
AFTER FOUR THAT IS A GOOD SHOT 
INTO FIVE EARLY DAYS OF COURSE BUT TREVOR 
IMMELMAN STILL HAS THE LEAD EVEN 
THOUGH HE HAS DROPPED SHOT AT THE 
FIRST PAUL CASEY GOT A LONG BIRDIE 
PUTT AT THE SECOND TO GO TO EIGHT 
UNDER KEN BROWN CAUGHT UP WITH HIS 
COACH 
HOW DID YOU TWO GET TOGETHER 
ORIGINALLY WE BOTH WELL REPRESENTED 
BY THE SAME COUNTRY AND WE WERE 
PUT TOGETHER IT HAS BEEN A NICE 
RIDE SO FAR A LITTLE OVER SEVEN 
YEARS AND WAS LOT WHAT HAVE YOU 
BEEN WORKING ON THIS WEEK HIS FORM 
IS SPOT ON WE HAVE WORKED THE LAST 
TWO WEEKS TRYING TO GET ALL THE 
TECHNICAL STUFF ORGANISED THE GAME 
PLAN BEING TO NOT HAVE ANY SWING 
THOUGHTS WHEN YOU GET HERE YOU 
HAVE PLAYED IN MAJORS YOU KNOW IF 
YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR SWING 
YOU WILL NOT PLAY WELL SO WE TRY 
TO GET ALL OF THAT AT THE WAY AND 
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS CONCENTRATE 
ON HITTING SHOTS SHAPING SHOTS 
FEELING COMFORTABLE ON EVEN LIES 
VISUALISING HOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO 
PLAY THE GAME 
WHAT ARE THE 
STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF HIS 
GAME 
THE NUMBER ONE STRENGTH IS GAME HIS POWER HE IS AS LONG AS TIGER 
WOODS HE IS PROBABLY A BIT MORE 
CONSISTENT THAT IS HIS NO ONE 
STRENGTH HE SHORT GAME HAS BEEN A 
WITNESS THAT WE HAVE WORKED HARD ON 
IT HAS GOT MUCH BETTER WITNESS 
WEAKNESS HIS GREAT HIS MENTAL 
STRENGTH IS THE FACT THAT HE IS ONE 
OF THOSE RARE PLAYERS THAT WHEN 
THEY GET FOUR FIVE SIX UNDER PAR HE 
WANTS TO GO TO EIGHT OR NINE UNDER 
PAR HE DOES NOT BACK OFF HE IS 
READY TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE DO DO YOU THINK HE CAN DO IT TODAY I THINK THERE IS NO QUESTION YOU 
HAVE TO BELIEVE IF YOU BELIEVE IN 
YOURSELF AND YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE 
ANDY WHITE TO BE HERE AND YOU HAVE 
THE SKILLS TO SUCCEED YOUR 
PERCEPTIONS WILL BECOME REALITY 
AND I THINK HE REALLY PERCEIVES 
HIMSELF AS A PLAYER WHO DESERVES TO 
BE HERE AND WIN THIS FOR BIRDIE IT IS A TAPPING PAR PAR PAR STOP FOR PAUL CASEY START A COUPLE OF FIVES ON THE CARDS FOR STEVE FLESCH AND PAUL CASEY THE PERFECT TEE SHOT THE PIN IS 
RIGHT UP ON THE BACK RIGHT HAND 
CORNER A LITTLE LOW ONE IN ALMOST PERFECT NOT BAD EIGHT TEN FEET FOR BIRDIE ON THE THIRD PAUL CASEY'S BIRDIED CHANGE ON THE 
FIRST JUST SKIRTED THE EDGE OF THE 
HOLE SO IT IS A PAR SEVEN UNDER 
PAR PAR START THE STOCK THE WIND 
IS DUTCH THE WIND IS EXPECTED TO 
FRESHEN IT WILL DRIVE THE GREEN DOUBT COME 
AS WELL IT WILL DRY THE GREENS 
OUT AS WELL TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN THAT WILL BE VERY TESTY YOU WANT TO THREAD IT THROUGH THE 
GAP OF THE BUNKERS WHERE IS THE 
BEST STOP THE BEST SPOT TO 
FINISH 
THE LEFT HAND TRAP IS FINISH PERFECT IT WILL BOUNCE FORWARD AND 
RIGHT ROUND WHITE ROUND AND COME RIGHT ROUND THAT WILL BE A DIFFICULT PUTT NOT 
TOO BAD I THINK HE IS O. K. THERE IF 
IT HAD BEEN ANOTHER COUPLE OF 
FEET BUT THAT IS A GOOD SHOT 
THAT WILL SETTLE HIM DOWN IT LOOKS ALL RIGHT THE BALL IS 
LOOKING TO THE LEFT HE HAS LEFT 
HIMSELF FRISKY DOWNHILLER THE HUGE PIECE SHOT A HUGE TEE SHOT JUST BEFORE I AM DOWN HILL DOWN WIND JUST THE FOUR IRON THAT LOOKS LIKE BUNKER RIGHT WHERE TIGER WOODS WAS IT IS RIGHT UP IN THE LAST TONGUE 
OF THE BUNKER NOT TOO BAD BUT IF 
IT IS IN THE FRONT BIT A DIFFICULT 
BUNKER SHOT IT WAS A TOUGH DAY ON THE FIRST BUT TODAY HAS THE HIGHEST SCORE YET IT IS A PAR PAR PAR START FROM 
TIGER WOODS TWO BIRDIE CHANCES 
MISSED HE REMAINS AT FIVE UNDER 
PAR NOT WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR 
HE LIKES TO CHARGE RIGHT IN THE JAWS IT GIVES YOU AN 
IDEA OF THE PACE IF YOU GET THE 
WRONG SIDE OF THE CUT AN EXTREMELY 
TIDY START TWO UNDER AFTER HIS 
OPENING FIVE HOLES WELL HOLED STEWART CINK THAT WAS 
A TOUGH DOWNHILL BIRDIE BIRDIE 
PAR STOP HE IS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE THERE IS NOTHING QUITE LIKE AUGUSTA 
NATIONAL ON SUNDAY AND HAZEL IS 
HAVING SNUFFLE AROUND THE CLUB HOUSE 
THE MASTERS' ATMOSPHERE IS BEST 
SUMMED UP A ROUND HERE THE MAIN 
MEETING PLACE THIS IS THE CLUB 
HOUSE BUILT IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTIES AND 
RIGHT HERE YOU HAVE GOT A CURIOUS 
MIXTURE OF RELAXED AND INTIMATE 
EXCLUSIVITY THIS IS THE TEE LAWN 
WHERE THE MEMBERS THE FAMILIES AND 
THE PLAYERS ENJOY COOLING 
LEMONADE AND BITE TO EAT BUT 
ONLY TWENTY YARDS AWAY URINE TOO MANY 
KNOCKING TENSION OF THE ATMOSPHERE 
AROUND THE FIRST TEE THE NEED 
KNOCKING THERE IS KNOWN MICROPHONE 
IN USE BECAUSE THE NOISE IS LIKELY 
TO DISTRACT OTHER PLAYERS NO 
THIS IS THE NINTH GREEN AND BY THE 
BIG SCORE BOARD JUST BENEATH THAT 
IS THE 
OVER HERE BY 
THE TALL PINE TREES IS THE TENTH 
TEE WITH PRACTICE PUTTING GREEN 
RIGHT HERE YOU HAVE GOT ALL OF 
THESE HOLES AND HOSPITALITY CRISS 
CROSSING IN THE ONE PLACE THIS IS 
A TERRIFIC PLACE TO SPEND AT LEAST 
PART OF YOUR DATE AT AUGUSTA 
NATIONAL AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT PIN TODAY 
JUST OVER THE TRAP THAT IS A 
BEAUTIFUL SHOT HE LOST IN MATCH 
PLAY TO TIE GET A FEW WEEKS AGO 
TIGER WOODS IT SOUNDED NICE THAT IS ABOUT AS 
GOOD AS HE COULD DO WITHOUT TAKING 
A HUGE RISK HAZEL IS ALWAYS IN THE PLACE TO BE ISN'T SHE GREAT ATMOSPHERE AROUND THE CLUB HOUSE TIGER WOODS DOESN'T NEED TO MAKE 
ANYTHING HAPPEN YET BUT IT IS 
GETTING CLOSE 
THIS IS WHERE HIS 
POWER COMES INTO IT HE IS CAPABLE 
OF FLYING IT OVER THE FRONT BUNKER 
AND LANDING IT SO SOFTLY BUT TO 
GET IT CLOSE THERE ARE VERY SMALL 
MARGINS OF ERROR 
REALLY GUSTING 
HE IS WAITING FOR THE GUST TO GO HE HASN'T MADE THAT MANY BIRDIES 
THIS WEEK NOT FOR HIM HE NORMALLY 
NEXT FOUR FIVE OR SIX PER ROUND HE LIKES THE LOOK OF IT OH DEAR 
NOT NOW INCHES SHORT AND THAT HIS 
WAY FIJI THAT IS WHERE VIJAY 
SINGH WAS IF IT COMES DOWN TO THE 
BOTTOM OF THE BUNKER IT IS TOUGH 
BUT IF IT STAYS ON THE UPSLOPE IT 
IS QUITE AN EASY ONE THE SECOND GREEN SNEDEKER WITH THE 
FAST CURLING LEFT RIGHT EAGLE 
CHANCE 
I LIKE THIS BOY'S GAME HE CHANCE HAS GOT A LOVELY SWING AND NICE 
YOUNG MIND FREE FROM WOES HE WON 
TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR HE CAN JUST 
RELAX AND ENJOY HIS LIFE JUST CONFIRMING THAT THAT PITCH MARK WAS ON THE GREEN IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL HAVE TO GO VERY CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE GREEN IT IS IN IT IS AN EAGLE FOR 
SNEDEKER HE GOES TO TEN UNDER PAR 
HE GOT RID OF HIS NERVOUS VERY 
QUICKLY NERVOUS JUST WHAT THE 
DOCTOR ORDERED WELL DONE WATCH THE CROWD TO JUMP THERE THEY 
GO GREAT STUFF AND WE ARE ONLY ON 
THE SECOND HOLE VERY GOOD FOR THE AUGUSTA NATIONAL VERY BIG PUTTING SERVICES SURFACES THIS FOR A BIRDIE HE WILL BE IN JOINT LEAD IF THIS IS NUDGED IN HE STRIDES OFF FOR THE SHORT OF ONE ON THE COURSE IN THIRD SHORTEST THAT IS MAGNIFICENT WHAT A SHOT 
FROM CASEY YOU JUST HAD A LITTLE 
FLIP ONTO THE GREEN A GREAT GOLF 
SHOT ABSOLUTELY STUNNING HE PITCHED IT 
ON THE FRINGE IT ALMOST HAD TWO 
BOUNCES BEFORE IT REACHED THE GREEN 
UNBELIEVABLE IT WIPED ITS FEET BUT IT IS IN THE WEB LEE WESTWOOD HAS BEEN 
STRUGGLING ON THE GREENS ALL WEEK 
AND IT IS CONTINUING IN AN 
INTERVIEW YESTERDAY HE SAID HE HAS 
BEEN LIKE THIS FOR MONTHS PAUL CASEY GETS WITHIN TWO EIGHT UNDER PAR THAT WAS CRUEL THAT WAS A GOOD PUTT IT IS A LITTLE LEFT THE BUNKER IS THERE I DIDN'T SEE IT COME DOWN OH DEAR THIS IS SIX F. T. JUST TO FUND 
FIRM THAT BUNKER SHOT WAS 
SUBLIME HOWEVER HE HAS MISSED THE 
PUTT AND HE HAS GOT A TOUGH ONE FOR 
BOGEY IT JUST SEEMED TO HOP A LITTLE IT 
MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A BIT OF PACE OUT 
OF IT A GORGEOUS PUTT FROM 
HARRINGTON STRAIGHT IN THAT IS A DROPPED SHOT 
FOR TIGER WOODS HE IS BACK TO FOUR 
UNDER PAR A FRUSTRATING START THAT IS JUST GORGEOUS TO WATCH NOT 
EASY HITTING THE FAIRWAYS HE IS 
AVERAGING TWO HUNDRED NINETY FOUR YARDS THE FOURTH 
LONGEST HE IS HITTING LONG AND 
STRAIGHT OFF THE TEE A PERFECT 
POSITION IS THE LEADER BOARD TIGER WOODS HAS HAD HIS PROBLEMS 
DESPITE A GREAT BUNKER SHOT HOW 
GOOD WAS IT 
UNBELIEVABLE HE LANDS 
IT ON THE GREEN WATCH THIS JUST 
INCREDIBLE TWICE HE KILLED IT ON 
THE FRINGE SHEER GENIUS BUT IT'S 
STILL COST HIM A SHOT 
A LITTLE 
CHANCE TO MEANDER DOWN THE LEADER 
BOARDS PICK OUT YOUR OWN 
PARTICULAR FAVOURITE WE ARE PRETTY 
FAMILIAR WITH THE TOP PAGE PHIL 
MICKELSON STILL AT TWO UNDER AFTER 
EIGHT HOLES RETIEF GOOSEN HAS 
DROPPED A COUPLE TODAY LEE 
WESTWOOD HAS HAD HIS PROBLEMS WITH 
THE PUTTER AGAIN THE AUSTRALIAN 
STUART APPLEBY IS CURRENTLY TWO 
UNDER PAR NICK DOUGHERTY THREE 
UNDER IAN POULTER HAD BACK TO BACK 
BOGEYS JIM FURYK FOUR OVER AT THE 
TURN NICLAS FASTH SEVENTY FIVE GEOFF 
OGILVIE SEVENTY FOUR A LITTLE PITCH FROM IAN WOOSNAM AT 
THE FOURTEENTH HIS THIRD EARLIER ON 
TODAY AND NICELY DONE LOOK AT 
THAT FLAG YOU CAN SEE THE GREENS 
ARE DRYING OUT WAS HE AN EARLY 
STARTER FIFTY YEARS OF AGE A GOOD EFFORT FROM 
HIM AND SANDY LYLE THEY START 
THEIR CAREERS ON THE SENIOR TOUR 
OVER HERE IT IS ALL HE CAN DO TO GET IT OUT 
VERY UNLUCKY TO PLUG IN THAT BUNKER 
HE TOOK THE RISK GOING WITH THE 
DRIVER TAKE YOUR PUNISHMENT YOU HAVE GOT TO FEED IT INTO THE TONGUE FROM THE RIGHT HE WANTS TO HIT THIS WITH A 
REASONABLY LOW TRAJECTORY HE DOES 
NOT WANT TO HAVE IT FLOATING IN THE 
AIR AND SPINNING BACK TO MUCH THAT WAS A MISHIT WHEN THEY HOP 
FORWARD WITH THAT WITH BIG 
GELDING DIVOT 
IT HAS DONE QUITE 
WELL ACTUALLY AN INCREDIBLY EASY 
TWO PUTT FROM THERE HE HITS 
THE BALL VERY HIGH IN THE BUNKER THE RIGHT HALF OF THE BUNKER MIGHT BE EASIER THAN THE LEFT NOT MUCH HE WAS EYEING IT UP BUT THAT IS 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET THE BALL 
UNDER THE TREES IT HITS ABOVE THAT 
OF WIND A BUT THAT HE IS NOT HAPPY TODAY IT IS NOT 
GOING WELL THAT IS NOT IN THE 
BUSHES IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD HAVE 
DONE BUT IT IS NOT GREAT NOT THE 
START HE WAS LOOKING FOR IT IS THE LITTLE 
UP THE 
HILL WIND OFF THE LEFT NOT TOO BAD THE OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP 
IS ON FROM THE SEVENTEENTH TO TWENTY FIRST JULY AT 
ROYAL BIRKDALE THERE MIGHT BE A 
FEW BREEZY DAYS THERE TIGER WOODS JUST COMING OUT OF THE 
ROUGH IT IS GOING TO FEED BACK 
DOWN OFF THE GREEN AND IT WILL BE A 
TOUGH UP AND DOWN FOR MOST PEOPLE 
JUST 
NOT FIRING 
YET IS HE A VERY 
A VERY FRUSTRATING START MISSING BIRDIE 
CHANCES ON THE SECOND AND THIRD 
AND HE THOUGHT HE HIT THE PERFECT 
SHOT TO THE FOURTH AND ENDED UP 
SHOUTING DROPPING A STROKE HE TRIED TO LAND IT IN THE FRINGE SIX INCHES SHORT A LOVELY LINE THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL 
SHOT A GREAT AMOUNT OF SPIN FOR 
SUCH A SHORT SHOT IT HAS COME SHOOTING OUT THIS TIME 
HE WILL HAVE THAT FOR A BOGEY FOUR 
IT IS SO EASY JUST THE SECOND'S 
LAPSE IN YOUR CONCENTRATION HE GOT 
TOO GREEDY WITH THE FIRST BUNKER 
SHOT AND PAID THE PRICE A BIG SWING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT 
VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THE SPEED IT 
WILL ALMOST COME SIDEWAYS AT THE 
END THAT IS A GOOD PUTT A SAFE PAR TREVOR IMMELMAN STAYS TEN UNDER WITH THREE HOLES IN THE FINAL ROUND THE MARGINS ARE JUST SO FINE BOTH PLAYERS UNDER PAR NOW MIGUEL 
ANGEL JIMENEZ GOING ALONG 
BEAUTIFULLY LYING THIRTEENTH THERE ARE 
OTHER THINGS TO PLAY FOR TODAY AS 
WELL THE TOP SIXTEEN GET BACK NEXT YEAR 
IT IS NICE TO GET INTO CHRISTMAS 
WITH YOUR INVITATION FOR THE 
MASTERS ALREADY IN THE BANK NOT FAR AWAY A BRAVE EFFORT BUT 
THAT PUT TREVOR IMMELMAN BACK IN 
THE LEAD BY ONE TEN UNDER NINE 
UNDER SNEDEKER STEVE FLESCH WITH 
THAT LITTLE PUTT IN THE FOURTH 
ESTATE EIGHT FOURTH TO STAY EIGHTH YOU CAN SEE 
HIS REACTION I DO LIKE HIS ATTITUDE LOOK AT THAT A BIG SMILE WHEN YOU MISS A PUTT SOUNDLY DONE FORTY YEARS OF AGE HE 
SEEMS TO HAVE CONTROL HIS NERVES 
CONTROLLED AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT PUTT HERE FOR BIRDIE NEVER MIND PAR HE IS GOING TO HAVE THAT FOR A 
BOGEY HE MUST HAVE DRIVEN IT IN 
THE BUNKER OR SOMETHING HIS MAJOR PERFORMANCES LAST YEAR 
WERE NOT BAD HE WON FOURTEEN TIMES FOUR 
TIMES IN THE U. S. A. HE LOST IN MATCH PLAY TO WOODS THIS YEAR A HELTER SKELTER PUTT THIS ONE 
THERE IS A VERY SEVERE SLOPE UP 
THEN DOWN THERE ARE OTHER SIDE 
THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OH NO I DON'T BELIEVE IT HOW CAN 
THAT STOP JUST ON THE JAW WHAT A 
FRUSTRATING START FOR TIGER WOODS AS TIGER WOODS HEADS TO THE SIXTH TEE OH NO WHAT IS GOING ON THAT IS A 
HUGE CLUB HE HAS HIT 
HE WAS 
PROBABLY TRYING TO OPEN CLUB FACE A 
LITTLE BIT BETWEEN CLUBS IF YOU'RE 
GOING TO MISS IT IS NOT EASY FROM 
THERE BUT AT LEAST YOU HAVE 
SPORTING CHANCE THE FINAL DAY 
AUGUSTA NATIONAL AT THE GREEN 
JACKET AT STAKE BLUSTERY BREEZE 
TRICKY GREENS NICELY DONE EARLIER ON KEN WAS HAVING A LOOK AT THE TRICKY SIXTH 
FROM THE ELEVATED TEE WITH THE WIND 
SWIRLING SHOT SELECTION IS VERY 
IMPORTANT JUST OVER THIS FRONT 
BUNKER YOU HAVE FOUR YARDS TO LAND 
IT IN SO YOU HAVE TO BE PINPOINT 
ACCURATE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TOO 
FAR PAST BECAUSE IT LEAVES YOU A 
VERY NASTY FAST DOWNHILL THE 
PLAYERS HAVE ANOTHER OPTION TO USE 
THIS BANK IF YOU CAN FIRE THE BALL 
UP THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THERE IS A 
REASONABLE MARGIN OF ERROR IT 
SHOULD COME TRICKLING BACK BUT IF 
YOU GET IT BACK YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
TAKE THE BUNKER ON YOU CAN HIT IT 
TO THE RIGHT OF THE FLAG AND USE 
THE CONDORS BUT YOU DO NEED THE 
BALL TO COME TRICKLING BACK FROM 
STOP TRICKLING BACK WITH THIS 
SWIRLING BREEZE AND THE CONDITIONS 
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE PINPOINT 
ACCURATE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT YARDS 
IT IS A BIT LEFT JUST ON THE EDGE IT SHOULD BE FINE 
HE HAS VERY 
GIVEN AWAY FIVE BIRDIES THIS HOLE 
ONLY HERE SHE COMES IT MUST COME DRIFTING BACK GO ON GREAT SHOT PLUS SEVEN FOR JUSTIN ROSE SUCH A 
SHAME A GREAT START TO THE WEEK 
BUT IT IS ALL LEARNING PROCESS 
HE WILL COME BACK NEXT YEAR WITH A 
LOT MORE KNOWLEDGE 
IT IS QUITE A PLACE THE AUGUSTA 
NATIONAL YOU DRIFT DOWN MAGNOLIA 
LANE PICTURE POSTCARD WHEREVER YOU 
LOOK OVER THE HOGAN BRIDGE 
EVERYTHING IS SHEER CLASS THE LONG 
SOFT TIDES OF THE GREEN GRASS JUST LEFT OF THE HOLE LOOK AT THE 
SPEED OF THAT THESE ARE THE ONES 
YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE SOMETIMES 
YOU JUST TRY BIT TOO HARD WHAT HAS BEEN SHOT OF THE DAY SEVENTH HOLE JIMENEZ THAT IS WHERE WE SAW HARRINGTON'S BALL FANTASTIC ALL THE WAY EAGLE TWO 
FOR JIMENEZ HE HAS KEPT IT GOING 
FROM THERE THERE IS MORE TO COME

SPECIAL VERY NICELY DONE STEVE FLESCH AT THE FIFTH RIGHT INTO THE HEART OF THE GREEN 
FLAGS TUCKED AWAY IN THE CORNERS 
NOT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY IT IS A WAY OF PROTECTING THE 
COURSE I DO NOT THINK THE POWERS 
THAT BE WANT TO MANY SIXTY FOURS BUT THEY 
WANT TO BE FAIR A FAIR TEST BUT 
YOU HAVE TO PLAY WELL AND HAVE 
APART FROM ALL THAT MOMENTS OF 
GOOD FORTUNE SOMETIMES MOMENTS OF 
GREAT GOOD FORTUNE HE COULD BE UP AGAINST THE FRINGE HOPING TO GET DOWN IN TWO THE IDEA WAS GOOD A LITTLE SOFTER 
IT HAS BEEN A MIXED BAG OF SORTS 
SO FAR GOODNESS ME I WOULD NOT LIKE TO 
PICK A WINNER AT THIS MOMENT VERY 
DIFFICULT INDEED YOU WOULD THINK 
THE WINNER IS GOING TO COME SEVEN 
FROM FOUR WONDER YOU NEVER KNOW THERE IT IS A TWO FOR TIGER WOODS 
HE IS BACK WHERE YOU STARTED AND 
SIX HOLES HAVE GONE WHERE HE 
STARTED HE WILL NOT BE TOO WENHAM 
IT WITH THAT HE HAD A COUPLE OF 
CHANCES AND DID NOT MANAGE TO DO IT GOOD MAN IT IS HIS FIRST PARA OF THE DAY PAR TREVOR IMMELMAN WITH A PUTT THAT HE 
NEEDS IF HE IS GOING TO MAINTAIN 
HIS LEAD WHAT HE NEEDS NOW IS WHAT THEY 
CALLED YEARS AGO THE IMMELMAN 
MANOEUVRE IT WAS A GENTLEMAN CALLED IMMELMAN 
WHO IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR WAS A 
PILOT HE GIVES UP AND FLY AROUND 
GOOD AS IT CAN FLY SPECTACULAR 
DIVES IT WAS AN IMMELMAN MANOEUVRE THAT WAS VERY CONFIDENTLY HOLED INDEED DROP SHOT AT THE FIRST DROVE INTO THE TREES STILL RIGHT THERE GOT TO DIG DEEP NOW THOUGH HE HAS BEEN IN VERY GOOD FORM OF 
LATE FELL FOUL OF THE RULES LAST 
WEEK THE SEVENTH HOLE IS 
THE HARDEST HOLE ON THE FRONT LINE IT IS SUCH A 
DIFFICULT TEE SHOT A NARROW 
FAIRWAY ABOUT TWENTY SIX PACES WIDE IT IS 
ON A BIG TOLD FROM LEFT TO RIGHT 
ANY DRIVE DRIFTING DOWN THE LEFT 
HAND SIDE FINISHES IN THE ROUGH IF 
YOU MISS IT YOU GET CLUTTERED UP 
WITH BIG PINE TREES AND YOU CANNOT 
FIND THE PUTTING SURFACE ACE THE 
GREEN IS DIFFICULT A SEA OF WHITE IT TAKES OFF THIS TEE A LITTLE DRAW 
SHOT RIGHT TO LEFT TO HOLD IT 
INTO THE SLOPE AND WATCH HOW YOU DO 
IT TIGER WOODS PRODUCES THE ANSWER THAT WAS HIS TEE SHOT 
ON FRIDAY DRILLED IT LOW WITH A 
BIT OF RIGHT TO LEFT ON IT THAT WAS FRIDAY WHAT CAN WE DO TODAY WHAT A WEALTH OF TALENT THAT BOY HAS TOOK OFF LIKE A BULLET THAT IS A GOOD SHOT IF YOU GO RIGHT DOWN THE BANK YOU GET RIGHT ON THE WHOLE POSITION TEVEZ IS SAFELY UP THE FAIRWAY AND SO IS SNEDEKER JUST SHORT BUT YOU WILL SEE THE PIN THERE THERE IS A LOOK AT AMEN CORNER 
ELEVENTH GREEN ON THE LEFT ONE OF THE 
MOST POPULAR VIEWING SPOTS 
IF YOU 
PRESS YOUR RED BUTTON YOU CAN SIT 
AND WATCH THOSE THREE HOLES ALL DAY 
THEY ARE PRETTY EXCITING BUT NOT AS EXCITING AS WHAT IS GOING ON HERE FOR THIS SHOT YOU HAVE TO GET THE 
RIGHT DISTANCE COME ANYTHING SHORT 
WILL FEED BACK OF THE GREEN ANYTHING LONG IS DISASTROUS OH YES NOW THAT WAS SPECIAL 
THAT WAS FROM THE LEADER SHOT FROM IMMELMAN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PEDIGREES 
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES HEAD TO HEAD 
HERE TODAY 
BOTH ARE TAKING A LONG 
TIME IT IS VERY NOTICEABLE 
CONDITIONS ARE TRICKY WITH THE WIND THAT WAS A LITTLE TOO SHORT FRUSTRATIONS FRUSTRATIONS WHAT YOU NEED IS A BIT OF GOOD 
FORTUNE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES SAY 
NO THEY ARE PLAYING WITH RIFLES 
THESE DAYS BOTH OF THEM LANDED A DISTANCE AWAY 
FROM EACH OTHER BUT BOTH GOT AN 
EXCELLENT RESULT L. WONDER WHETHER THEY MIGHT START TAKING TOO LONG VERY NICELY DONE FROM CASEY IT HELPED GETTING THE BALL UP QUICKLY THAT WAS CKY IT IS ALL PARS FOR FLESCH SO FAR FOUR TIME WINNER ON TOUR WELL THAT IS WHAT I MEAN BY A BIT OF 
GOOD FORTUNE HE WAS TEN YARDS AWAY 
AND NOW HE IS IN FOR TWO THE BALL MAY HAVE MOVED THAT WAS OFF TAKE HE HAS GROUNDED 
HIS PUTTER RANDY BALL HAS MOVED 
NOW HE HAS TO TRY AND REPLACE IT SUCH IS 
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE RULES HE AIMED IT HE AIMED DAD YARDS TO THE RIGHT AIMED AT TIGER IS NOT 
HAVING THE BEST OF GOOD FORTUNE AT 
THE MOMENT HE SPUN BACK OFF THE 
GREEN 
HIS ALL ROUND GAME IS THE GREEN THING THAT IS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE 
TO ME EVERY PART OF HIS GAME IS 
NEAR THE TOP PUTTING CHIPPING WE WILL TRY AND CLARIFIED WHAT THIS IS THIS IS FOR A BOGEY SO THE BALL DID MOVE PENALTY SHOT SNEDEKER WITH A BIRDIE ON FIVE SEE 
HOW THE LITTLE INCIDENTS WE SAW 
WITH CASEY CAN INFLUENCE THE RESULT YOU THINK 
THAT WAS UNLUCKY OR HE HAD A BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE PENALTY SHOT THE BALL MOVED AND THAT IS A VERY SHAKY RUN AFTER 
MAKING A GOOD START HE MUST FORGET 
ABOUT THAT NOW HE NEEDS TO GET 
BIRDIE OR TWO 
TREVOR HAS A CHANCE 
HERE TO INCREASE HIS LEAD EXCELLENT GREAT BIRDIE HE GOES 
BACK TO ELEVEN UNDER THAT IS WHERE HE 
STARTED THE DAY ALWAYS HAPPY TO GET DAVE GET A PAR FOUR AT THE FIFTH WILL THEY GOOD EFFORT JUST A PAR 
HE TAPS THAT IN 
THAT WAS A GOOD 
EFFORT LYING IN SIXTH POSITION TIED WITH CASEY IMMELMAN USED TO WATCH GARY PLAYER 
AS A BOY THAT THERE HE IS WITH 
GARY PLAYER THE GARY HAS NOT 
CHANGED HAS HE THAT IS GREAT 
PLAYER WAS HIS HERO AND NOW HE IS 
TRYING TO EMULATE HIM BY WINNING 
THE MASTERS PLAYER DID IT THREE 
TIMES IMMELMAN IS LOOKING TO DO IT 
FOR THE FIRST TIME OF BIG CHANCE AT THE EIGHTH IF HE CAN 
GET A GOOD TEE SHOT HE HAS BIG CHANCE ELEVATION CHANGE HERE ON SIX OF THAT IS A TREMENDOUS DRIVE SCUTTLE ACROSS AT THE MASTERS 
SPONSORED BY I. B. M. INTERESTING HOW 
THE SPECTATORS SIT UNDER THE TEE AT 
THE SIX THERE ARE HUNDREDS ON THE 
BANK JUST WAITING FOR THE SOUND OF 
THE BALL TO GO OVER THEIR HEADS AND 
THE SLIGHT SMELL OF BURNING RUBBER 
LOOKING AT THE TREES AND TRYING TO 
GUESS THE RIGHT CLUB I REMEMBER HIM PLAYING CRAIG WATSON 
IN THE FINAL OF THE AMATEUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP CRAIG WATSON PLAYS IN 
OUR GRAND MATCH HAS PLAYED A FEW 
TIMES AT DEAL DEAL ALL OVER IT HE MAY NOT BE CALM INSIDE BUT HE 
CERTAINLY LOOKS IN CONTROL OF 
THINGS AT THE MOMENT HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A BIT 
OF FORTUNE TO GET THE BALL TO THE 
GREEN IT WAS MADNESS THE GREEN 
WAS NEVER DESIGNED FOR FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY YARDS BEAUTIFUL PUTT WESTWOOD BACK TO 
EVEN PAR UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T 
THINK HE WILL FEATURE IN THE END 
RESULT TODAY HE WAS GOING ALONG SO 
WELL YESTERDAY AND TOLD THE WHEELS 
CAME OFF UNTIL THE WHEELS CAME 
OFF ALL THE TALK THIS WEEK WAS ABOUT TIGER'S GRAND SLAM IT WAS ONE WITH OVER PAR LAST YEAR 
BUT IT WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE OVER 
PAR THIS YEAR UNLESS SOMETHING 
DRAMATIC HAPPENS IT HIT THE TREE AND RICOCHETED OVER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FAIRWAY SNEDEKER HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT POOR 
TEE SHOT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE YARDS AND THE BREEZE 
A LITTLE OFF THE RIGHT HE WAS 
TRYING TO USE THE SLOPE ON THE 
GREEN TO FEED THE BALL DOWN AND HE 
DID NOT CARRY IT FAR ENOUGH SEE JUST HOW FAR RIGHT HE HAS TO START THIS BALL THIS IS WHERE YOU TO BLOT OUT 
OF THE POINT WAY YOU WANT THE BALL 
TO GO TO PICK OUT A SPOT OUT OF 
THE POINT WHERE YOU WANT THE BALL 
TO GO HE LOOKS LIKE AN OLD HEN SORT OF GETTING READY TO LAY AN EGG SOME OF THESE PUTTS ARE VERY TRICKY TO WORKOUT THEY USED TO BE AN 
ARNOLD PALMER PUTTING COURSE AT 
SOUTHPORT BIG GROUNDS I THINK HE IS IN THE FRONT BUNKER A COSTLY HOLE NICE TO SEE SOME YOUNG PEOPLE HERE 
THE POWERS THAT BE HAVE INTRODUCED 
AN IDEA WHERE THE YOUNG FOLKS IF 
ACCOMPANIED BY SOMEBODY WITH A 
TICKET COME IN FOR FREE IT WAS 
INSTIGATED BY THE WILL AND ANCIENT 
A FEW YEARS AGO IN BRITAIN AND 
THAT HAS BEEN GREAT SUCCESS AND 
IT IS NICE TO SEE THEY HAVE COPIED 
THAT IDEA HERE AT THE MASTERS NICE 
TO SEE THE YOUNG ONES COMING IN THIS IS A TRICKLE DOWN THE LEFT 
YES IT SHOULD BE OUTSIDE LEFT AND 
VERY FAST GOOD EFFORT THE DIFFICULTY ON FAST 
GREENS THIS IS ALL RIGHT BUT 
YOU LEAVE YOURSELF A LOT OF FOUR 
AND FIVE FOOTERS FOR THE SECOND 
PUTTS AND THAT BECOMES VERY TAXING 
BY THE END OF THE WEEK 
THE BEST 
PLAYERS THE MOST PROLIFIC THEY 
PLAYED THE GREENS WHEN THEY ARE IN 
THE WORST CONDITION EVERYBODY HAS 
WORKED THEM UP PAUL CASEY'S WOES CONTINUE NO BACK WHERE HE STARTED THAT WAS 
A MISS CUE PROBABLY TRYING TO 
PITCH IT PAST THE FLAG THAT WAS ONE OF THE VERY FEW POOR SHOTS OF PADRAIG HARRINGTON WE HAVE SEEN ALL TYPES OF WAYS TO 
PLAY SHOTS INTO THIS HOLE USE THE 
BANK AT THE BACK BUT STEVE FLESCH 
HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT THERE FOR HIS 
BOGEY THINGS BEGINNING TO TIGHTEN UP A 
BIT MORE NOW THEY ARE BEGINNING TO 
FEEL THE PAIN OF IT ALL CLEAR 
THOUGHTS ARE DISAPPEARING AT THE 
GREAT RATE OF KNOTS MORE FOOTBALL 
THINKING BEFORE NIGHTFALL 
CODDLED FUDDLED ANOTHER ONE DRIFT AWAY STEVE FLESCH IS IN TROUBLE BRANDT 
SNEDEKER HAS DROPPED A SHOT TIGER 
WOODS HAS DONE NOTHING AND IS 
CREEPING NEARER TO SECOND SPOT TREVOR IMMELMAN NOW LEADS BY THREE 
FOURS NOT BRANSTON PICKLE ONE UNDER 
FOR THE ROUND BRANDT SNEDEKER 
ONE UNDER FOR THE ROUND NOT SO LONG AGO HE HE BIRDIED THREE TO GO EIGHT UNDER IN THIS STRETCH OF FOUR HOLES HE CHAMPIONSHIP IS NEARLY OVER HIS CHAMPIONSHIP THAT IS INTERESTING I DO NOT KNOW 
WHETHER THE WIND CHANGED OR WHETHER 
HE MISCUED BUT THAT IS FIFTY YARDS 
SHORT OF THE FLAG WE SAW PADRAIG 
HARRINGTON NEARLY REACH THE GREEN 
WITH HIS SECOND BUT HE IS NOT A 
BAD POSITION FOR A PITCH AND A PUTT IF THERE IS ANYTHING SO CHIPPING 
AS GOOD FIVE THAT WAS IT SUCH A THING AS A GOOD FIVE TREVOR IMMELMAN LEADS BY THREE SMACK IT TOWARDS THE BIG SCORE BOARD COMING BACK HE WHISKER WHISKER 
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT LANDED ON 
BUT IT LET FORWARD WHAT A BOUNCE IT LEAP FORWARD LEAPED COME ON PAUL CASEY SHAKE IT OFF HE HAS HAD A BAD RUN THE LAST THREE 
OR FOUR HOLES BRANSTON PICKLE ONE 
OVER FOR HIS ROUND TODAY THREE 
BEHIND BRANDT SNEDEKER THAT IS IN THE HOLLOW THEY ARE UP THE FAIRWAY NICELY BUT 
IT IS TRICKY TO GET CLOSE TO THIS 
ONE WITH YOUR SECOND SHOT ANGEL WHITE SAND BEAUTIFUL LUSH 
GREEN FAIRWAYS THEY MAKE LITTLE 
NIPS AND TUCKS THIS IS THE SEVENTH 
GREEN AND THIS AREA HAS BEEN 
EXTENDED FOR THIS PIN POSITION 
MORE GREEN AT THE FRONT AND 
FRACTIONALLY IT HAS BEEN FLATTENED 
OUT BUT WHAT A TOUGH PIN TWO OR 
THREE YARDS TO LAND IT IN JUDGING 
THE DISTANCE IS VERY DIFFICULT YOU 
CANNOT AFFORD TO BE SHORT OVER THE 
BACK IS EVEN WORSE YOU CAN PITCH 
IT PAST THE FLAG AND HOPE YOU GET A 
BIT OF LUCK IF YOU DO NOT LOOK AT 
THE PACE OF THIS L. ON FIFTEEN FEET AWAY 
IT IS VIRTUALLY A FULL WOULD PRESS 
GIVE IT A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE WILL IT 
MAKE IT L. THINK 
IT WILL IT GIVE IT A LITTLE NUDGE L. HIT THAT TO GO 
ABOUT AN INCH AND IT HAS ROLLED FIFTEEN 
FEET THIS NEW PIN POSITION IS VERY 
TRICKY TO GET THERE IS ALMOST NO 
WAY YOU CAN PUT IT TO GET IT JUST 
RIGHT FIND THE FAIRWAY AND YOU 
STILL HAVE TO PLAY THE PERCENTAGES 
I THINK THIS SEVENTH HOLE COULD BE 
THE TOUGHEST HOLE ON THE COURSE 
I THINK HE IS RIGHT PARTICULARLY 
AS IT IS SUCH AGED SUCH A LONG 
IRON THIS GREEN WAS NEVER MEANT 
FOR A LONGER SHOT O. K. BUT THAT IS STILL FOR A FIVE LOTS OF ROLES IN THIS GREEN IF YOU 
ARE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO PITCH INTO 
THE FACE OR WHOLE IT COULD 
SCUTTLE BY HE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT 
THIS IS IF HE CAN GET THE BIRDIE 
HE CAN GET ONE UNDER FOR THE DAY 
AND SIX UNDER FOR THE TOURNAMENT CRISP IS IT UP ENOUGH NO MAYBE THREE YARDS SHORT HE MAKES HARD WORK OF IT I SEEM TO THINK HE DID NOT CATCH 
ALL OF THAT ONE PETER 
A LITTLE 
FLUFFY 
YES I THOUGHT SO THIS IS FLUFFY WHAT AUGUSTA IS ABOUT HE IS 
SLIGHTLY OFF ON A FEW SHOTS AND HE 
IS GETTING HIMSELF A VERY 
FRUSTRATED WADE INTO 
THE BACK NINE WAIT TO THE BACK NINE WAS NOT WAIT FOR THE BACK NINE PHIL MICKELSON AT THE TWELFTH HE HAS HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY FEW 
DAYS MAGIC MOMENTS AND THEN QUITE 
YOUNG QUITE LONG PERIODS OF 
MISTAKE AFTER MISTAKE YESTERDAY HE WAS RIGHT UP THERE 
NEAR THE TOP OF THE LEADER BOARD 
HE FALTERED HE NOW FINDS HIMSELF 
TEN SHOTS BACK THIS IS A DIFFICULT PUTT TO READ ANOTHER CHANCE HAS SLIPPED BY ONLY TEN HOLES LEFT THE FLAG IS HARDLY MOVING SHELTERED IN THAT CORNER THE BIG SCORE BOARD BEHIND DEFLECT SOME OF THE WIND THIS GREEN IS ONLY FOR AN EIGHT 
IRON OR NINE IRON IT IS VERY 
DIFFICULT OH YES HE HAS JUST GOT THE BREAK 
PITCHED ON THE FRONT EDGE AND MOVED 
FORWARD WHAT IMPRESSES ME ABOUT HIM HE 
LOOKS VERY CALM AT THIS MOMENT L. 
AM SURE HE IS NOT BUT HE IS DOING 
VERY WELL TO KEEP EVERYTHING 
TOGETHER HIS NEAREST CHALLENGER NOW BRANDT SNEDEKER THREE BEHIND IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT WHEN YOU ARE 
CHASING AND THE LEADER KEEPS 
POPPING IT IN 
HE IS FIRING IT IN 
FIRST AND HITTING GOOD SHOTS HE HAS PUT THAT INTO THE BUNKER IT 
IS INTERESTING HOW THE MOVEMENT IS 
EBBING AND FLOWING AT THE MOMENT 
EARLIER TODAY WE HAD OUR GOOD 
FRIEND FROM MALAGA MIGUEL ANGEL 
JIMINEZ AND HE PITCHED IT LEFT IT 
STARTED TO TURN AND WE DID NOT 
THINK THERE WAS MUCH AND THEN 
SUDDENLY IT GOT CLOSER AND CLOSER HELLO HIS FRIENDS WERE WHOOPING AND 
HOLLERING IN THE GALLERY AND WHY 
NOT HE APPRECIATED THEM BEING WITH

MISSED THE ONE BOGEY TODAY BACK ON 
SEVEN BRANDT SNEDEKER FOR A PAR FOUR IT TURNED RIGHT AT THE DEATH THAT IS A SHOT GONE GOOD TEE SHOT FOUR BOGEYS AN EAGLE AT THE SECOND 
IF TREVOR IMMELMAN CAN POP THIS IN 
HE WILL INCREASE HIS LEAD A FIVE 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE YOUNG 
PEOPLE COMING IN WE GO FROM THE 
SUBLIME TO THE RIDICULOUS BECAUSE 
NEXT WEEK AT THE WESTFIELD GOLF 
CLUB IN SURREY IT IS THEIR FATHERS 
AND SONS COMPETITION ALWAYS GREAT 
FUN IT IS A GREAT OCCASION WHEN THE 
FATHERS AND SONS COME DOWN TREVOR 
IMMELMAN IS FROM A GOLFING FAMILY 
AND THEY WILL BE CHEERING IF THIS 
GOES IN SUNDAY AFTERNOON AT THE MASTERS HOW IMPORTANT WILL THAT ONE SHOT BE 
OVER THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF HOURS 
OR SO IT 
JUST WENT STRAIGHT LEFT 
IT IS A RIGHT EDGE PUTT HE DID NOT SEEM TO MISS KUWAIT HE JUST AIMED IT WRONG MISCUED IT IT WENT OFF IN HIS HANDS 
ALL WILL 
BE FORGIVEN IF HE CAN GET A FOUR AT 
THE UPHILL PAR FIVE H. EIGHT CLEM GETS SOMETHING POSITIVE TO 
HAPPEN ON THIS FRONT NINE TRY 
AND GET SOMETHING POSITIVE WE HAVE 
SEEN EVERYONE FROM THE FRONT OF THE 
GREEN MESSAGE UP THEY ARE JUST NOT 
ABLE TO GET THE BALL ALL THE WAY 
BACK TO THE HOLE MESS IT UP THEY THEY ARE STILL THERE THE SUNBATHERS 
LOTS OF DRAMA STILL TO COME WE SAW TIGER WOODS TAKE IT OVER THIS BUNKER TIGER WOODS A STRUGGLE TO GET IT TO 
THE GREEN FROM PAST THAT BUNKER SO 
HE JUST NEEDED TO LAY IT UP THERE WE MOVE FORWARD TO THE NINTH TIGER 
WOODS HAS HIT A GOOD DRIVE DOWN THE 
HILL A SHORT SHOT IN THE GREEN HAS BEEN FLATTENED A 
LITTLE BIT HE CAN STILL GET A LOT 
OF SPIN IF HE PITCHES PAST THE FLAG THAT COULD BE O. K. IT WILL NOT STAY 
THEY CANNOT BELIEVE IT AND NEITHER 
CAN I HE NEEDED THIS BEEN HE HAD BACK ON SEVEN THE SPIN PAUL CASEY HE 
IS HAVING A ROUGH OLD TIME HE IS FOUR OVER AT THE MOMENT AND HE IS STRUGGLING TO GET HIS PAR AT THE EIGHTH 
FIVE OVER THE LAST FOUR EIGHTH HOLES THEY WILL BE AIMING RIGHT OVER THE 
MIDDLE BUNKER 
HE HAS BEEN IN THE 
WATER AT THE ELEVENTH L. THINK HE HAS 
BEEN VERY LUCKY INDEED 
WE HAVE 
SEEN THEM PLUG IN THE HILLS AND NOT 
BE FOUND THAT WAS VERY FORTUNATE STEVE FLESCH BACK TO EIGHT UNDER 
HE IS SOLE SECOND THREE BEHIND TREVOR IMMELMAN HE HAS BEEN STEADY EDDIE ALL WEEK BRANDT SNEDEKER IS TWO OVER TODAY FOUR BEHIND HE HAS GONE LEFT TREVOR IMMELMAN 
IN THE BUNKER THAT IS IN THE TREES 
SUDDENLY THE GAME BECOMES A BIT 
MORE DIFFICULT THAT BUNKER HAS BEEN ENLARGED ON 
THE RIGHT THIS IS QUITE CLIMB UP 
HERE YOU DO NOT SEE THE GREEN WHEN 
YOU ARE BACK HERE BIG HUMPS ON THE 
LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE GREEN IF YOU 
CANNOT REACH YOU ARE BETTER OFF ON 
THE RIGHT SO YOU CAN COME AND 
PITCHED STRAIGHT UP THE GREEN YOU 
GET SOME IDEA OF THE WAVES IN THE 
GREEN IF YOU ARE NOT BOLD ENOUGH 
IT IS HARD TO GET UP TO THE BACK OF 
THE GREEN THIS IS AN UNSETTLING 
TIME FOR TREVOR IMMELMAN HE HAS 
MISSED THE PUTT ON THE PREVIOUS 
HOLE BUT GOT PAR NO GREAT 
DAMAGE DONE IF HE GETS A FIVE HERE 
FIVE FOUR THAT IS NOT BAD AND A 
COUPLE OF PARS STARTING THE BACK 
NINE IT MIGHT JUST SETTLE HIM DOWN PAUL CASEY FOR PAR SIX SHOTS IN FIVE HOLES WHEN THE BLEEDING STARTS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO STOP YES ANOTHER GOOD PUTT HOLED HE IS IN SIXTH PLACE AT THE MOMENT THAT IS A SUCKER PIN POSITION YOU 
HAVE JUST GOT TO MAKE IT UP ONTO 
THE GREEN TIGER WOODS IS COMING DOWN ACROSS THE SLOPE STEVE FLESCH WILL TRY TO HIT IT WITH A LITTLE SLIDE RIGHT TO LEFT THEY MOVE THIS TEE BACK TO MAKE IT 
FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY BUT IT HAS NOT MADE A LOT OF 
DIFFERENCE ALTHOUGH IT IS DOWN 
WIND TODAY ALWAYS A DIFFICULT SECOND SHOT 
STEVE'S BALL WILL BE ABOVE HIS FEET 
BUT FOR RIGHT HANDERS THE BALL WILL 
BE BELOW THEIR FEET GETTING ACROSS 
THE GREEN AT AN ANGLE THERE IS THE FIRST HOLE GOING AWAY 
INTO THE DISTANCE TIGER WOODS 
PROLES NO GREAT EXPECTANCY OF HOLE IN 
THESE PUTTS HUGE DIFFICULT HUGELY DIFFICULT HE HAS OVERDONE IT GOOD SPEED TIGER WOODS HAS THAT PUT FOR THAT 
IS SIX FOR THE NINE HOLES FOR 
THE THIRTY SIX FOR THE NINE HOLES WHICH IS 
WHERE HE STARTED NO RUN THERE BUT THAT WILL LEAVE 
HIM WITH A WEDGE NINE IRON FOR HIS 
THIRD SHOT THAT MAY PROVE A LITTLE 
BIT EASIER THAN SOME OF THE 
PITCHING WE HAVE SEEN ON THAT EIGHT 
GREEN STEWART CINK AT THE NINTH NOT HARD ENOUGH HE WAS DISQUALIFIED A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS AGO BECAUSE HE STUCK IN A 
FAIRWAY BUNKER WITH THE BALL 
OUTSIDE THE BUNKER HIT IT INTO THE 
BUNKER AND HIS CADDIE BREAK AT THE 
BUNKER AND IT WAS TESTING THE SAND 
FOR THE GREEN SIDE BUNKER HE DID 
NOT FIND OUT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY 
HAD SOME BODY TALKING ABOUT AND 
SAID YOU HAVE VICTIM MACRO A SHOT 
PENALTY YOU SIGNED THE WRONG CARD 
YOU HAVE A TWO SHOT PENALTY NOBODY IS MAKING MUCH HEADWAY ON 
TREVOR IMMELMAN STEVE FLESCH GOING 
ALONG STEADILY WHERE HE STARTED 
BRANDT SNEDEKER HAS DROPPED 
COUPLE OF SHOTS TIGER WOODS AND 
STEWART CINK ARE WHERE THEY STARTED PAUL CASEY HAS DROPPED SIX SHOTS IN THE LAST FIVE HOLES THE TOP SIXTEEN PLAYERS ARE INVITED BACK LAST 
NEXT YEAR SO IT 
IS IMPORTANT THESE PLAYERS KEEP 
TRYING I AM JOINED IN THE COMMENTARY BOX BY KEN BROWN AND SAM TORRANCE THAT WAS A POOR ONE FROM TREVOR 
IMMELMAN THAT IS WAY BACK A 
DIFFICULT TWO PUTT THEY SAY IT DOESN'T START UNTIL THE BACK NINE ON SUNDAY WE ARE INTO THE BACK NINE FOR THE 
GREAT TIGER WOODS HAS HE TURNED IT 
ENOUGH TO GET THE BENEFIT OF THE 
SLOPE THAT WILL RAISE ALL THE WAY 
DOWN TO THE FLAT NOT BAD AT ALL 
AND IT IS STILL GOING THE NINTH HOLE 
THE THIRD HARDEST THE TENTH HOLE THE SECOND HARDEST 
YOU'RE COMING TO THE FOUR HARDEST 
HOLES ON THE GOLF COURSE THEY HAVE 
GIVEN AWAY SIX BIRDIES ALL FOUR OF 
THEM TODAY THIS IS A STRETCH 
WHERE PART IS EXCELLENT PAR 
WATCH THE FLIGHT OF TIGER WOODS' 
BALL BEAUTIFULLY DONE A LITTLE 
MORE BOOKED THAN HE WAS AFTER 
GREAT THEY CAN PUT THAT GRAPHIC IN 
LIVE I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO THAT 
BUT IT IS VERY IMPRESSIVE BRANDT SNEDEKER HAS HAD A GREAT RECOVERY OUT OF THE TREES HE IS COMING OFF BACK TO BACK 
BOGEYS SO HE'S TAKING HIS TIME 
TRYING TO PICK THE WIND 
MAYBE TEN 
YARDS SHORT OF THE PIN TO THE HOLE 
IS DOWNHILL BUT IT WON'T RELEASE 
DOWN THE PIN SO HE HAS TO FLY IT 
ALL THE WAY TO THE HOLE HE IS 
CHANGING HIS CLUB WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT BACK TO 
THE DRAWING BOARD IT SOUNDS LIKE 
TO ME HE IS GOING TO GO WITH THE 
SAND WEDGE INSTEAD A BIT LOWER 
LANDED HALFWAY BETWEEN THE SLOPE 
AND THE PIN HOP FORWARD AND CHECK 
BY THE HOLE THAT IS THE PLAN IT WAS UNLUCKY IT GOT A HARD 
BOUNCED OFF THE FRINGE TOOK THE 
SPIN OF IT THAT 
IS AS GOOD AS YOU CAN DO THE PIN IS JUST THREE YARDS UP THE BANK IT IS A BOGEY FIVE AND HE WILL FINISH PLUS FIVE PAUL CASEY HAS BEEN IN TROUBLE A DANGEROUS SHOT HE MUST GET IT UP PAST THE HOLE SCREWED BACK THAT IS A GOOD SHOT FROM CASEY IT IS HIS THIRD A REAL BAD RUN AT THE MOMENT THE LEADER BY THREE BUT AN AWKWARD 
TWO PUTT A LITTLE RIDGE HE HAS GOT 
TO COME UP AND THEN IT IS DOWN THE 
OTHER SIDE ALSO TREACHEROUS ALL SO TREACHEROUS VERY TOUGH TO JUDGE ISN'T IT FUNNY HOW IT WORKS HE 
MISSED TIDDLER AND ON THE VERY 
NEXT HOLE HE IS FACING SEVEN F. T. SHOT FOR PAR OUTWARD HALF THIRTY SIX FOR FLESCH THREE BEHIND TREVOR IMMELMAN THAT COULD HAVE PLUGGED HE CAN STILL AFFORD A SMILE MOVING INTO THE VERY STIFF TESTS OF HOLES NINE TEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH DAY FOR THE 
BRITS TODAY LEE WESTWOOD GOING O. K. 
PLUS ONE HARRINGTON ONE ON THE DAY REALLY IMPORTANT PUTT HE IS COMING INTO THE FOUR HARDEST HOLES ON THE GOLF COURSE WE ARE TRYING TO CHECK ON PAUL 
CASEY THERE MAY HAVE BEEN PAR 
FOUR WE WILL CHECK WHEN WE ARE 
SHORT PHIL MICKELSON GOES TO THREE UNDER HE 
IS PLAYING WITH VIJAY SINGH WHO IS LEVEL FOR THE DAY I THINK HE HAS OVERCUT THIS ONE IT IS TIGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE PERFECT 
THE PERFECT TEE SHOT HE CARRIED 
THE DOWNSLOPE LOOK AT THE FLIGHT OF THE BALL 
THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO ON THE 
TENTH SLIDE IT AROUND THE EDGE OF 
THE TREES VERY IMPRESSIVE HE 
LOOKED ANXIOUS KNEW IT WAS TIGHT 
AROUND THE EDGE BUT A NICE FLAT 
SPOT TRACK 
AND ELEVATION CHANGE OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED 
FEET TO THE TEE YOU WANT TO HIT IT 
FROM RIGHT TO LEFT TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THIS HILL ON THE RIGHT 
THE DRIVING AREA ABOUT HERE THE 
FAIRWAY BUNKER IS NOT REALLY IN 
PLAY IT JUST MAKES JUDGING THE 
SECOND SHOT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT 
WITH DEPTH PERCEPTION A HUGE 
BUNKER ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE 
TIGER WOODS IS RIGHT UP ON THE FAR 
SIDE OF THE FAR BUNKER TWENTY EIGHT ON SIX 
OF THE LEFT HAND SIDE TIGER WILL 
NEED ALL OF HIS MAGIC TO GET IT UP 
AND DOWN A SLIGHTLY HIGHER FLIGHT DOWN THE 
LEFT HAND SIDE UP TO THE TEE SO 
IT MUST BE IN GOOD SHAPE PRETTY 
GOOD JUST IN THE LIGHT ROUGH IT 
SHOULDN'T MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE 
I UNDERSTAND VALIANT IN THE DAY 
YOU'RE HAVING A LOOK AT THE ROUGH 
EARLY 
WITH THE PINS TUCKED IN THE CORNERS 
YOU MUST BE ABLE TO SPIN THE BALL 
AND CONTROL HIS LENGTH AND 
DIFFERENT SINCE WE HAVE BEEN HERE 
WE HAVE ALMOST SEEN THE ROUGH GROW 
THEY CALL IT THE FIRST CUT THE 
BALL NESTLES A FRACTION FROM THERE 
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO 
IMPART AT THE SPIN YOU OFTEN CAN 
AVOIDING THE ROUGH IS CRITICAL 
WITH THESE TIGHT PIN POSITIONS 
BEING IN THERE MAKES CONTROLLING 
THE DISTANCE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THE TOP SIXTEEN BITS YOU BACK NEXT YEAR GETS DON'T YOU JUST LOVE BEING HERE THE 
MOST SCENIC GOLF COURSE IN THE 
WORLD BEAUTIFULLY MANICURED THEY 
ARE OUT TRIMMING THE BUNKERS WITH 
SCISSORS SOMEBODY IS IN A BIT OF TROUBLE IT 
LOOKS LIKE STEWART CINK OH MY 
GOODNESS GRACIOUS HE HAS GOT GOOD CONTACT ON IT 
TIGER WOODS IS NOT PLUCKED NOT DO 
DIFFICULT FOR HIM IT WAS LUCKY FOR 
HIM HE DID NOT PLUG UP THERE HE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ALL SORTS OF 
TROUBLE I HAVE TO SAY HE HAS NOT 
HAD MANY GOOD BREAKS HE HAS BEEN A 
BIT UNLUCKY HE HAS BEEN GETTING REGULAR HUMAN BREAKS THE SAND IS VERY FIRM YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR IT CLUNKING BETWEEN YOU A FAIRLY SQUARE STANCE I THINK HE 
WAS TRYING FOR A BIT OF A CHEQUE A 
FAIRLY LONG SWING WATCH HOW HARD 
HE BEATS DOWN HE MAKES SURE IT IS 
THE SAND FIRST BEFORE THE BALL IT 
WASN'T ONE OF HIS VERY BEST I'M I'M SURPRISED HE WOULD RISK FLYING THE 
BALL SO FAR TO THE HOLE OUT OF THAT 
TRAP NOT USING THE GREEN TO FEED 
IT DOWN TO THE HOLE WE SAW TREVOR IMMELMAN OVER TO THE RIGHT SO THIS MUST BE SNEDEKER HOW TOUGH IS THIS IT WILL BE ALONE 
SNAP HOOK GET ON THE FRONT EDGE 
A LOW 
IN THIS SITUATION YOU 
CANNOT AFFORD TO BE IN THE LEFT 
HAND BUNKER YOU HAVE TO GET IT 
SOMEHOW PINNED HIGH RIGHT WHERE THE 
CROWD IS WHERE IS IT GOING TO FINISH NOT 
TOO BAD STILL AWKWARD BUT IT IS 
FAR ENOUGH BACK TO BE ABLE DESPITE 
IT BEING DOWN BREEZE TO PUT A 
CHECK ON HIS LITTLE PITCH THIS IS 
A STRETCH THAT IS GOING TO TEST 
THESE LEADING TWO PLAYERS AT THE 
BACK OF THE FIELD 
QUITE DIFFICULT 
HARD TO KEEP YOUR FOOTING HE NEVER QUITE GOT ENOUGH OF THAT 
DID HE HE TRIED TO HIT A LITTLE 
LOW ROPING HOOK HE KNOWS THAT HE 
HAS MADE QUITE A LOT OF MISTAKES 
HERE ON THIS FRONT NINE HE WILL 
HAVE TO PLAY THE BACK NINE MUCH 
BETTER 
WITH THE BREEZE BEHIND BETTER THIS IS SLIGHTLY EASIER WHEN THE 
BREEZE IS IN YOUR FACE IT IS SO 
EASY TO SPIN THE BALL OFF THE FRONT 
OF THIS GREEN SIX UNDER AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT IS 
ABOUT YOUR CAREER EARNINGS 
SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THEY ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND A JACKET HOME FOR A YEAR BUT THEY 
MUST TAKE IT BACK IMPORTANT SHOT GET UP OH NO IT IS LUCKY IT HAS 
CAUGHT THE TRAP ACTUALLY THIS 
COULD HAVE GONE FIFTY YARDS BACK DOWN 
THE 
IT HADN'T CAUGHT IT 
GETTING A LITTLE BIT TIGHT HERE HE 
MISSED THE LITTLE PUTT ON SEVEN 
ONLY EIGHTEEN INCHES OR TWO FEET TO GET 
A FIVE SHOT LEAD EASY THREE THERE IT JUST WENT WRONG AT EIGHT FOR 
THEM IN THE BUNKER UP NINE HE HAS 
GOT TO REGROUP VERY QUICKLY I I SUPPOSE SOME OF THE GOOD NEWS IS 
THAT TIGER WOODS IS NOT MAKING ANY 
SORT OF A CHARGE HE IS MANAGING TO 
TREAD WATER HE HAS GOT A TRICKY 
PUTT ON THE TWELFTH TO HOLE PAR IF 
TREVOR FINISHES AT TEN UNDER PAR HE 
IS RED HOT FAVOURITE TO WIN 
IF HE 
HAD SEVENTY TWO TODAY HE WOULD HAVE WON 
WITHOUT DOUBT I BELIEVE BUT THERE 
IS A LONG WAY TO GO THE BACK NINE 
IS THE MOST EXCITING NINE HOLES OF 
GOLF THAT WAS CASEY ON TEN JUST HUNG ON THE FRONT OF THE GREEN WHEEL JUST HEARING THAT PADRAIG 
HARRINGTON WAITED TWELVE MINUTES TO 
PLAY THIS SHOT WE ARE THAT IS A 
TREACHEROUS CHIP ACROSS THE GREEN 
DOWNWIND IF YOU GET IT RIGHT THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE OF A ONE STRAIGHT 
BACK INTO THE BREEZE THIS BACK NINE IS GOING TO PLAY HAVOC 
WITH THE PLAYERS THIS AFTERNOON 
THE BREEZE IS BLOWING FOR THE FIRST 
TIME ALL WEEK TIGER WOODS DROPS ONE HE GOES BACK 
TO FOUR ON THE ONE BEHIND TREVOR 
IMMELMAN UNDER HOPEFULLY WE ARE GOING TO HEAR SOME CHEERS SHORTLY YOU HAVE GOT TO BEAR ON THE LONG 
SIDE YOU DO NOT WANT TO COME UP 
SHORT HE HAS GOT TO MAKE SURE HE 
GETS IT UP A BIG BANK TO COME UP 
AND JUST PUTT ON THE VERY TOP OF IT 
TRIED TO STOP AT THE TOP OF THE 
FLOWER POT TRY VERY WELL DONE SNEDEKER FIVE 
MINUTES FROM TWO AND A HALF HOURS 
FOR HIM TO PLAY NINE HOLES HERE IS THE MAIN CHALLENGER STEVE 
FLESCH EIGHT UNDER THE MAIN SPOT 
THAT IS O. K. UNDER THE HOLE UNDER UNDER THE RADAR TOO A FUNNY LOOKING ACTION WE HAVE HAD 
SOME MARVELLOUS BUNKER PLAYERS FROM 
SOUTH AFRICA MOST NOTABLY GARY 
PLAYER TONY JOHNSON HAS BEEN ON 
THE EUROPEAN TOUR A RICH HISTORY 
THEY CERTAINLY HAVE L. WISH WE 
COULD GET A LOOK AT HIS LINE JUST 
TO SEE WHAT SORT OF SHOT HE DOES 
HAVE IT IS DEEP THAT IS NOT BAD AT ALL JUST THE PUTT YOU WANT ON A NASTY SIX 
F. T. SHOT DOWN HILL 
EXACTLY THE SAME 
PUTT AS PAUL CASEY HAD TWENTY MINUTES 
AGO THIS HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDING ROUND BY MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ TREVOR AT THE MOMENT IT LOOKS LIKE 
HE HAS GOT A BIG WARD OF PEANUT 
BUTTER 
ON TOP OF HIS HAND DURING DURING ON GRASS CURTAINS DURING ON GRASS CUTTINGS BUT IT IS THE PLACE HE WOULD LOVE 
TO BE IN THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL 
ABOUT LEADING THE MASTERS TEN 
HOLES TO GO HE HAS BEEN DREAMING 
ABOUT THIS HIS WHOLE LIFE NOW HE 
IS FINALLY THERE TAKE THE BULL BY 
THE HORNS ON THE BACK NINE NOT FAR AWAY MY GOODNESS HE 
THOUGHT HE HAD MISSED IT BUT HOW 
DID IT MISSED IN THE END 
IT LOOKED 
LIKE THAT WENT PAST TREVOR'S MARKER THIS WOULD TAKE TREVOR IMMELMAN OUT 
IN THIRTY SEVEN ONE OVER WITH A TWO SHOT 
LEAD GOING INTO THE BACK NINE ONLY TWO PLAYERS IN THE LEADING SIXTEEN 
HAVE SHOT UNDER PAR ON THE FRONT 
NINE THAT IS THIRTY FIVE BY HARRINGTON 
WHEREAS THE OTHER ONE MIGUEL ANGEL 
JIMENEZ THE ONLY TWO TO SHOOT 
UNDER PAR ON THE OPENING NINE 
WHERE IS IT TELLS YOU HOW 
DIFFICULT IT IS OUT THERE TODAY 
ONLY TEN PLAYERS UNDER PAR HE KNOWS THE LINE HE HAS PUT JUST ENOUGH PACE ON IT 
A TIMELY ONE TO HOLD FOR TREVOR 
IMMELMAN HE LEADS BY TWO THAT 
WILL BE A BOGEY FIVE NICELY JUDGED IT WAS A CRUEL RUN OF HOLES NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE TODAY THIS IS FOR BOGEY OH MY GOODNESS WHAT A FOUR THAT WILL BRING A GREAT SMILE TO HIS FACE 
HE HAS FINALLY HOLED A PUTT FACE HE HAS PLAYED ABSOLUTELY 
BEAUTIFULLY FROM TEE TO GREEN WELL 
DONE HE LIKES TO FADE THE BALL SO IT IS 
A BIT TRICKY FOR HIM THIS ONE 
DOWNWIND OFF THE RIGHT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT RIGHT ABOUT 
WHERE TIGER WOODS WAS BUT HE HAS PICKED UP YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FIRST IT 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT THE TEE HE 
HAS NOT BEEN FIRING ON ALL 
CYLINDERS 
DOES HE TRY TO PLAY CYLINDERS AGGRESSIVELY AND CHASE THE PINS OR 
DOES HE DEFEND IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE TAKES ON 
THE NEXT FEW HOLES THAT IS A LITTLE UNLUCKY IT IS NOT 
GOING TO GET QUITE TO THE FLAT AND 
IT MAY HAVE A BIT OF MUD ON IT THE 
WAY IT'S STUCK INTO THE FAIRWAY OH LOOK INTO THE FLIGHT YOU WOULD 
THINK WITH THAT SORT OF FLIGHT IT 
WOULD HAVE RUN A LITTLE LOOK AT 
THAT A LOOK 
WE HAVE BEEN JOINED 
BY PETER ALLISS 
JUST IN TIME TO 
SEE STEVE FLESCH THE QUIET MAN IT IS A LITTLE SHORT OF PACE IT DIDN'T NEED MUCH MORE NICK DOUGHERTY HAS 
EXPERIENCED HIS FIRST MASTERS A 
MORE THAN RESPECTABLE PERFORMANCE 
FROM HIM ONE BIRDIED TODAY BUT A 
FEW PROBLEMS UP THERE AS WELL 
YOUR VERY FIRST 
MASTERS HOW VALUABLE HAS THIS BEEN 
TO YOU 
IT HAS BEEN A SUPERB WEEK 
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE DONE A 
LITTLE BETTER BUT ALL IN ALL TO 
PLAY ALL FOUR MODERATE DAYS I HAVE 
DONE MYSELF PROUD FOUR L. HAVE 
TAKEN THE MOST I COULD OUT OF THIS 
WEEK 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW DIFFICULT WEEK THESE CONDITIONS ARE FOR SCORING 
THEY ARE QUITE DIFFICULT L. THINK 
THE FLIGHT ARE MORE ACCESSIBLE 
TODAY YOU HAVE GOT TO HIT GREAT 
SHOTS BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO GET CLOSE 
TO THE FLIGHT THE WIND DOESN'T 
MAKE IT SOMEWHAT MORE TRICKY BUT 
THERE IS GOOD SCORE OUT THERE L. 
CAN SEE SOMEONE SHOOTING FEW 
UNDER PAR BUT IT IS KEEPING CONTROL 
OF THE BALLS 
COME BACK AGAIN 
PLEASE 
THE GREEN JACKET MEANS THAT YOU ARE 
A PART OF HISTORY 
THE LEGEND THE THE TEE IS A SYMBOL OF EXCELLENCE IT IT MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME 
IT MEANS 
YOU HAVE WON THE GREATEST 
CHAMPIONSHIPS IN GOLF 
THIS IS VERY 
SPECIAL 
SOME OF THE BEST PLAYERS SPECIAL HAVE WON THIS EVENT 
YOU ARE PART 
OF THIS CLUB 
IT IS A 
RESPONSIBILITY AND A PRIVILEGE IT IT MEANS AN AWFUL LOT TO CARRY IT WE WE ARE PROUD TO PUT THE JACKET ON 
EVERY YEAR 
IT IS ONE OF THE 
GREATEST THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IN 
GOLF WILL'S LIFETIME A GOLFER'S 
LIFETIME 
SO TIGER FINDS HIMSELF SIX BACK 
FLESCH HANGING TOUGH IMMELMAN 
THE LEADER IN THIS APPEARS IT RATTLED IN 
ONLY EIGHT HOLES LEFT IT 
DISAPPEARS WE MUST BEGAN TO EXTRA 
TIME CASEY FIVE OVER TODAY TWO WONDER EIGHT BEHIND TWO UNDER NOT QUITE THE BEAUTIFUL BUNKER SHOT OF SIX INCHES THAT IS A SAFE THREE HE IS LEVEL 
PAR FOR TODAY TWO WONDER EIGHT 
BEHIND TWO AT UNDER WHAT A GLORIOUS SHOT JUST OVER 
THAT BUNKER AND ANOTHER CHANCE FOR 
A BIRDIE FOR LEE WESTWOOD 
CURRENTLY A TIE FOR FOURTEENTH THE TOP 
SIXTEEN COME BACK TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN YARDS TO GO THAT IS O. K. BELOW THE HOLE TOUGH 
SWING OF THE RIGHT STAYS AT SIX 
UNDER THERE HE IS THE ONLY PLAYERS TODAY ARE UNDER 
PAR AFTER ALL MICKELSON AT ONE 
UNDER AND JIMENEZ OUR PHIL 
MICKELSON HEATH SLOCUM EARLY ON HAD A SIXTY NINE THE DOOR IS OPEN JUST GOT TO WALK THROUGH 
I WONDER WHETHER HE MIGHT THROUGH PUT HIMSELF IN A POSITION OF TAKING 
A LITTLE TOO LONG SOMETIMES YOU 
CAN OVERDO IT SOME PEOPLE PLAY QUICKER AND MAKE 
MISTAKES SOME PEOPLE TAKE LONGER 
RUN A BIG MISTAKES IT IS GETTING 
THAT BODY RHYTHM HE IS GIVING IT THE STAIR IT LOOKS SIMPLE ENOUGH GOOD SHOT STRAIGHT ENOUGH HE 
FOUND THE TARGET BUT HE GOT AWAY 
WITH A FOUR AT THE NINTH THE SEVENTH AND 
EIGHTH WERE COSTLY THAT WAS FOR PAR IT HAS BEEN AN 
EXPENSIVE HOLE FOR PHIL MICKELSON 
THIS WEEK THAT WAS A BIT OF A POKE HE HAS 
MISSED COUPLE OF HANDFULS OF THAT 
SORT OF RANGE PUTT THIS WEEK THAT 
WILL BE VERY FRUSTRATING HE PLAYED 
SPLENDID GOLF FROM TEE TO GREEN 
THE ELEVENTH HOLE WIND ACROSS RIGHT 
TO LEFT THE WATER ON THE LEFT HAND 
SIDE 
WE ARE MOVING INTO AMEN SIDE CORNER THE ELEVENTH TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH 
YOU CAN SEE THE WIND SWIRLING ABOUT 
THE GOLFING CHICANE THIS WILL BE INTERESTING PETER IF 
TIGER COULD FINISH OR ANYBODY 
COULD BIRDIE THE TWO PAR FIVES THE 
THIRTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH AND PAR THE OTHERS 
THAT WOULD PUT THEM IN VERY 
STRONG POSITION THIS IS DANGEROUS HOLE NOT A SINGLE BIRDIE SO FAR NOT ANYBODY HE IS SIX WOODS SIX STROKES BEHIND IMMELMAN THAT WAS SHORT NOT BAD BUT HE MUST 
HAVE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE AT LEAST 
TEN YARDS NEARER WHAT IS HARRINGTON 
DOING DOWN THERE THE HAZARD AT THIRTEEN THIS BACK NINE IS NEVER WITHOUT INCIDENT WELL DONE IAN POULTER HAD A 
DISASTROUS RUN EARLIER DOUBLE 
BOGEY FIVE SIX AND SEVEN BUT HE DOES HAVE A NICE MEMORY TO 
TAKE HOME THIS IS WHAT HE COULD 
HAVE ONE HOLE IN ONE ON THE SIXTEENTH 
THE PIN IN SIMILAR POSITION TODAY 
SO WE COULD SEE IT AGAIN IT 
CERTAINLY BROUGHT SMILE TO HIS 
FACE BUT HE HAS BEEN STRUGGLING 
TODAY HE STARTED AT TWO UNDER AND 
IS CURRENTLY AT FIVE OVER WE'RE BACK TO SEE A LEADER AT THE TENTH UPHILL USING BEN CRENSHAW COUNTRY HE IS IN HE LOOKS TO BE AIMING WIDE OF THE CADDIE'S FEET HE SEEMED TO KISS A CAPTAIN TACT WILLOW CATKINS THEY 
CANNOT TOUCH YOU FOREIGN NOWADAYS 
FOR IT YES THE LITTLE WILLOW CATKINS THAT 
BLOW OF THE TREES WHATEVER THEY 
ARE GOOD RHYTHM MY 
SWING A NICE SWING LEVEL PAR FOR HIS ROUND TODAY EIGHT UNDER TWO BEHIND HE NEEDS TO GET SOMETHING GOING STRAIGHTER A BILL FOR HIS PAR STRAIGHT UPHILL TREVOR LOOKS A LITTLE ANXIOUS 
UNDERSTANDABLY HE IS TRYING TO BE 
A LITTLE TOO PERFECT CIRCLING THIS 
PUTT THERE IS A DANGER HE TRIES 
TOO HARD 
YOU CAN TAKE TOO LONG 
THAT IS ONE OF THE JOYS OF WATCHING 
HOW OTHER PEOPLE COPE WITH THEIR 
PROBLEMS AND THE MENTAL STRESSES 
THAT GO ON WELL DONE THAT ROUND OF NEED THEIR ANGEL 
JIMENEZ G. SIXTY EIGHT TO THE SIXTY EIGHT L. WOULD 
NOT BE SURPRISED IF HE GETS A 
LITTLE NEARER THE TOP IF THINGS GET 
EVEN RAUL EVEN HARDER HE PLAYED VERY WELL INDEED TREVOR MISSED ONE THIS SORT OF LINK AT THE SEVENTH OF THE LEADERS ARE 
ABOUT TO TAKE ON AMEN CORNER 
IT IS 
TWINNED WITH HEATHROW TERMINAL FIVE 
VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH NO UPGRADES FOR YOU KENNETH BEAUTIFUL SHOT FROM LEE WESTWOOD IF HE CAN KNOCK THAT IN HE WILL BE 
LYING TENTH NOT TOO BAD 
LOOK AT 
THIS FOR HARRINGTON STILL IN THE 
TREES JUST TIPTOEING DOWN THE HILL HE HAS HIT AN INCREDIBLE THIRD SHOT TO GET INTO THERE IN THREE OF GENIUS THAT IS A MONSTER STROKE 
BEAUTIFULLY JUDGED OF COURSE IT IS 
A LITTLE BIT LUCKY TO GO IN THAT 
WAS CRICKET PITCH LENGTH NEARLY 
JUST WHEN HE WANTED TO DO IT HE 
DID HE STILL HAS GOT A LOT TO DO 
OF COURSE BUT THAT IS ONE HOLE OF 
AMEN CORNER TUCKED AWAY FIRST FIRST BIRDIE AT THE ELEVENTH OF THE DAY THAT 
APPLAUSE JUST RINGS ROUND THE GOLF 
COURSE IT WAS AT LEAST FIVE FEET OF THE 
HOLE FIVE F. T. SHORT OF THE HOLE IT 
WAS MOVING AND THEN SUDDENLY IT 
DISAPPEARED IF HE CAN GO TWO FOUR 
NOW THAT REALLY WOULD STARE THEM 
UP A LITTLE BIT STIR THEM UP IT IT IS CERTAINLY NOT A SOUND THAT 
IMMELMAN OR SNEDEKER WOULD HAVE 
LIKED TO HAVE HEARD 
THERE IS OUR 
LEADER 
AMEN CORNER IS THE ELEVENTH LEADER TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH HOLES 
THE ELEVENTH IS A DIFFICULT PAR FOUR THE TWELFTH IS 
THE SHORTEST HOLE OF THE COURSE A VERY TRICKY TODAY 
WITH THE BREEZE THIRTEENTH IS A 
REACHABLE PAR FIVE SPLENDID HOLES 
THEY HAVE OFTEN HAD A STORY TO TELL 
AT THE END OF THE WEEK HE MOVES INTO THE GOLFING CHICANE WAITING TILL THE FAIRWAYS ARE CLEAR GOOD SHOT HE HAS KEPT GOING VERY 
WELL FLESCH SOME IMPORTANT HOLES 
COMING UP BUT HE IS HOLDING HIS 
GROUND VERY WELL INDEED TOO BOLD BUT A BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE 
A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE FOR 
THE TIGER THINGS ARE HOTTING UP GRAB SOME WARNING LIQUID AND SIT DOWN AND ENJOYED WARMING THE THEY HAVE SLIGHTLY WIDENED THE 
STAIRWAY A LITTLE BIT IT GIVES A 
LITTLE BIT MORE ROOM TO THE 
SPECTATORS VERY IMPRESSIVE ONE UNDER FOR 
THESE THREE HOLES IF HE CAN DO 
THAT TODAY HE WILL BE HALFWAY TO 
BUTTON UP THE GREEN JACKET 
BUTTONED UP OF IT IS O. K. THAT IS O. K. NOW HE 
HAS GOT A LITTLE DELICATE CHIP 
LEFT HERE WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY OF 
THESE ROUND ABOUT THE GREEN YOU 
NEVER KNOW YOU NEVER KNOW HE HE CERTAINLY PRODUCED A TERRIFIC 
MOMENT ON THE PREVIOUS GREEN HE 
WILL BE THINKING TO CHIP IT NO 
DOUBT SNEDEKER IS IN THIRD PLACE AT THE MOMENT THAT WAS O. K. THERE IS JUST NOTHING YOU CAN DO THERE AN IMPOSSIBLE PUTT HE DID A STEVE MCQUEEN THE GREAT ESCAPE AND HE KNOWS IT WELL DONE LEE WESTWOOD IT HAS BEEN A PRETTY GOOD WEEK NO ANOTHER ONE GOES THAT IS FIVE IT HAS JUST NOT BEEN HIS DAY SEVEN OVER TODAY OH YES WHAT A MAGNIFICENT SHOT 
IF HE PUTS THAT IN SUDDENLY HE IS 
TWO UNDER THEN HE WILL BE HALFWAY 
UP 
THE LEADER BOARD THERE IS SUCH A LOT OF VARIETY AROUND THE GREENS HE CAN BE QUITE FIRM WITH THIS I THOUGHT 
THAT WAS STONE DEAD THE WAY HE PUTTS IT PROBABLY IS LOOKING ACROSS A RAE'S CREEK OF THE BIG COLISEUM ALMOST A BIG COLISEUM WESTLAKE WHERE WE STAY EVERY YEAR THAT IS ANOTHER VERY PRESENT GOLF 
COURSE A VERY PLEASANT GOLF 
COURSE I REMEMBER TIGER 
MISSING A 
COURSE PRETTY SHORT PUTT ON THIS GREEN IN 
THE PAST IT IS EASY TO READ 
SOMETHING INTO THIS ONE THAT IS NOT 
QUITE THERE 
HE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT 
THIS IS HAVING JUST HOLED A 
MONSTER PUTT ON THE ELEVENTH AND PLAYED 
WHAT HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT WAS AN 
EXCELLENT TEE SHOT HE SAW IT GO TWELVE 
YARDS TOO FAR BEAUTIFUL DEAD CENTRE LEVEL PAR TODAY THAT IS AS HE STARTED IMMELMAN AND SNEDEKER HAVE BEEN ON 
THE FAIRWAY FOR A WHILE OR WAITING 
TO HIT THE SECONDS WITHOUT BEING TOO MUCH OF A SADIST 
I WANT TO SEE HOW FLESCH STANDS UP 
OVER THESE LAST FEW HOLES PLAY IS PATHETICALLY SLOW TWO AND 
A HALF HOURS FOR THE FIRST NINE 
HOLES IS RIDICULOUS GOOD BOY HAVE THAT JOHNSON RIGHT INTO THE TOP 
THAT JUMPS HIM EXTRAORDINARY WHEN YOU THINK HOW 
MANY SHOTS WE HAVE SEEN PHIL 
MICKELSON MISSED HE IS TIED FOR 
FIFTH AT THE MOMENT 
THINGS ARE 
DEFINITELY SLOWING UP SOME OF THE 
GREENS HAVE GOT BLOW WAS BLOWING 
THE WILLOW CATKINS OF THE GREENS WHAT DID WE JUST SAY FASCINATING 
HOW HE IS GOING TO COPE WITH THIS 
FORTY YEARS OLD HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 
LONG TIME HE HAS WON FORTUNES BUT 
NOT A WINNER YOU GET ACCIDENTAL 
WINNERS SOMETIMES LIKE TIGER IS HE CLEAR OF THE TREES THAT'S NOT TOO BAD DANGEROUS HOLE 
IT IS A BIT LIKE THE SEVENTEENTH AT THE 
OLD COURSE IN SAINT ANDREWS SHE HAVE 
TO PLAY THE ELEVENTH IN STAGES 
OTHERWISE YOU TAKE ISSUED RISK A 
BIG RISK 
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT SIDE 
OF THE TREE IT IS IN HE COULD BE 
HAMPERED THE MOMENT HE HIT IT HE 
SAID PUSHED IT INTO THE WOODED WENT JUST CREPT 
PAST THE TREE BUT IF HE CAN MOVE 
IT DOWN THE FAIRWAY HE SHOULD BE 
O. K. FOR A PAR FIVE NOT WHAT HE 
WANTS BUT NO GREAT TROUBLE FROM RIGHT TO THE GREEN YES HE VIRTUALLY HAS A FOUR SHOT 
LEAD RIGHT NOW THE HAS TO PLAY 
FROM RIGHT I DID NOT THINK I HAVE SEEN ANYONE 
PLAY THE THREE QUARTER PUSHED DOWN 
THE HILL WITH A THREE CLUBS TOO 
MANY CHIP IT DOWN A LONG CHIP AND 
RUN TOWARDS THOSE THREE PINE TREES 
ARE 
I HAVE TO BE HONEST THAT IS ARE EXACTLY WHAT I DID L. DID NOT WANT 
TO PUT IT IN THE AIR 
I THINK THE 
SEVENTEENTH AT SAINT ANDREWS IS NOT BAD 
PLAYED THAT WAY COMING IN FROM THE 
FRONT RIGHT TO LEFT IF YOU CAN 
KEEP IT BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE 
TREES YOU MAKE LIFE A LOT EASIER THAT IS WAY RIGHT THAT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FROM 
WHERE HE IS TO GET IT CLOSE TO THE 
PIN HE HAS GOT TO COME OVER THE 
TRAP I THINK HE MAY HAVE TO DROP IT AWAY 
BUT DOWNWIND OVER THE BUNKER A 
FEARSOME SHOT THAT IS ONE OF THOSE 
YOU COULD EASILY BE PUT INTO THE 
WATER THE GREEN TILTS 
FROM BACK RIGHT TO FROM LEFT HE IS PROBABLY JUST 
ABOUT O. K. BUT IT IS HIGH TARIFF PITCH BACK TO THE TWELFTH THE THIRD SHOT FOR STEVE FLESCH HE HAS GONE BACK QUITE A WAY GOT A NICE BIT OF BACKSPIN ON THAT 
ONE THAT WAS A BONUS 
THE HIGH 
SCORE EVER TAKEN AT THE MASTERS IS 
A THIRTEEN BY TOM WINDS CROFT AT THE TWELFTH 
IT HE SHOULD BUT IT CAN BE NASTY 
PHIL MICKELSON FINISHING OFF LEVEL PAR TIED FIFTH AT THE MOMENT HE DROPPED FOUR SHOTS AT THE SIXTEENTH ALONE A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL THINK WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TIGER WOODS HAS HE GOT IT BACK 
SWING THE HAS GOT SOMETHING OF A 
BATCH HE HAS GOT SOMETHING OF A 
BACK SWING 
I AM NOT SURE IF HE 
WANTS TO GO DOWN THE PROPER FAIRWAY 
HE HAS GOT NOTHING HE IS LOOKING 
WAY DOWN TO THE RIGHT AGAIN L. AM 
GETTING DIZZY WATCHING THAT ONE 
THAT IS WHAT HE HAS LEFT L. DO NOT 
THINK HE CAN HIT THE BACK SWING 
STRAIGHT DOWN THE FAIRWAY HE SEEMS TO BE DILLY DALLYING A LITTLE MAYBE NOT HE HAS GOT TO BE MINDFUL OF THE 
SHOT HE IS PLAYING INTO THE GREEN 
WHERE IS THE BEST PLACE FOR TO 
BE AT THE EIGHTEENTH HE SMASHED ONE UP 
THE TENTH FAIRWAY HARDLY ANYONE HAD BEEN UP THERE 
BEFORE IF YOU GET IT OUT FIFTY OR SIXTY 
YARDS HE IS LEFT WITH A SHORT IRON 
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT 
DROP SHOT TO PAR 
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK THE HEAD COVER IS SAYING IS IT A KIWI HE HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL HE DOES 
NOT GET A LUCIE LOCKET HE HAS GOT 
A STRAIGHT FACED CLUB SO HE HAS 
GOT TO SCUTTLE IT ACROSS THE GROUND 
HE WILL BE KEEN TO GET IT UP THERE 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YARDS TO LEAVE HIM ONE HUNDRED YARDS 
FOR HIS THIRD HE IS SO STRONG IT IS AMAZING HOW 
MUCH CLUB HEAD SPEED HE CAN MAKE 
WITH A TWO F. T. BACKSWING 
IF HE GETS A 
RUNNER IT SHOULD SCUTTLE THIRTY OR FORTY 
YARDS IT IS AN AWKWARD ONE AND IT 
DEPENDS HOW GREEDY HE IS IF HE 
TRIES TO BE TOO GREEDY OR CLEVER 
HE COULD COME ADRIFT BUT THE FLAG 
IS IN A DANGEROUS PLACE TODAY HE 
HAS GOT TO MAKE SURE HE GETS ON THE 
GREEN IN THREE HAVING SAID THAT 
HE WILL PROBABLY PUTTED IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE GREEN PUT IT IT IT IS DANGEROUS HE DOES ON WHAT HIS 
FEET AS THAT EITHER HE DOES NOT 
WANT HIS FEET TO SLIP EITHER GREAT CONTROL OF HIS HANDS BUT LOOK WHERE THE FLAG IS THE LEAD IS FOUR STEVE FLESCH WILL GO BACK TO SIX UNDER THERE WAS NO GRAB WE WERE 
EXPECTING A BIT OF CHECK ON THE 
SECOND BOUNCE AN UNCHARACTERISTIC 
PITCH FORCED THEIR BIGGER KUFFOUR 
BRANSTON PICKLE AN UNCHARACTERISTIC PITCH FOR 
BRANDT SNEDEKER 
TIGER WOODS IS ONE 
SHOT OFF SECOND 
I CAN THINK OF 
MANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE WHO WOULD 
NOT RELISH THE SHOT AT ALL ONE OF MY OLD PALS HE WAS A DAB HAND AT THIS SHOT I AM NOT SURE TREVOR IS TOO KEEN IT DID NOT NEED MUCH MORE TO GET IT 
THERE BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN WELL 
WELL WELL TWO PUTS FROM HERE PADRAIG HARRINGTON HAD HIS PROBLEMS ON FOURTEEN A LONG PUTT FOR PAR HE WILL GO BACK TO ONE UNDER IAN POULTER STARTED THE DAY AT TWO UNDER UNLUCKY PITCHED RIGHT ON THE 
DOWNSLOPE BUT THAT COULD COME 
TRICKLING DOWN THIS COULD BE 
FAIRLY HANDED FAIRLY HANDY THE AVERAGE FOUR ROUNDS OF SEVENTY THREE WHICH IS NOT BAD PLAY THIS TO SAVE HIS PAR AT THE ELEVENTH I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS FASCINATING 
WHEN WE GET UP TO TIGER WOODS L. 
THINK HE WOULD TRY TO PLAY ONE OF 
HIS FANCY SHOTS THE ONLY WAY HE 
CAN GET IT REASONABLY CLOSE IS TO 
GO WAY PAST AND DRAG IT PASSED OFF 
THE SLOPE THIS IS FOR A FIVE THEY ARE PROPPING THICK AND FAST DROPPING HE IS NOW TIED WITH TIGER WOODS 
ONLY TWO PLAYERS AHEAD OF TIGER 
WOODS NOW HERE HE GOES THERE IS A NICE BANK BEYOND THE FLAG THE AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS MAN 
AND IT IS GIVEN TO VERY FEW PEOPLE 
HE IS ACTUALLY ENJOYING THE 
CHALLENGE MIND YOU HE HAS GOT A 
FEW QUID IN THE BAG BUT HE IS 
LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING TO PLAY 
THE SHOT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE FLAG 
AND THE BUNKER GETTING SOME SPIN 
AND BRINGING IT BACK TO THE HOLE 
HE WAS LOOKING AT THE TREES SEEING 
WHICH WAY THE WIND WAS BLOWING HE 
MUST NOT BE SHORT DO YOU LIKE THAT NEARLY PERFECT ENJOY HIM WADAH KHANFAR STOP 
ENJOY HIM WHILE YOU CAN HE ALWAYS 
GIVES IT ONE HUNDRED ONE PER CENT IT IS A DELIGHT TO WATCH WHILE ALL AROUND YOU ARE LOSING 
YOURS KEEP YOUR HEAD KEEP 
PLODDING ON IT ALWAYS REMAINS STEADY THEN 
OFFERED GOES ON IT ALMOST 
REMAINS STEADY BUT OFF IT GOES MASTERCLASS ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT THAT ANSWERS A FEW QUESTIONS HE 
STAYS FOUR SHOTS CLEAR 
THAT WAS 
GREAT ABSOLUTELY GREAT TIGER WOODS WILL HAVE HEARD THAT 
ONE HE WILL NOT KNOW IF IT IS FOR 
BIRDIE OR PAR 
JUST WIPING DOWN HIS 
SABRE EVEN THE GRIP IS SWEATING THIS WAS 
HIS RECOVERY FANTASTIC THAT WAS WELL DONE BUT HIS NEXT SHOT WAS IMMACULATELY EXECUTED LOOK AT THE POWELL AMAZING LOOK AT THE BALL SPINNING THE POWER IT IS A TIME TO BE THINKING GREEN 
JACKET NOT LIFE JACKET 
ABSOLUTELY HE HAS GOT BUT REYNOLDS EYES LOOK AT HIM HE IS NOT JUST SEEING THE PICTURE THAT SOUNDED A BIT CLUNKY BUT DID 
HE GET THE BALL FIRST HE DID 
STUCK IN THE BACK IN THAT LITTLE 
TROUGH HORRID JUST INTO THE PINE 
NEEDLES THIS TO TIE SECOND HE HAS MISSED IT MY GOODNESS THAT 
IS NOT LIKE TIGER WOODS JUST THE 
PAR FIVE BEHIND ON BALANCE THOUGH 
THIS IS WHERE HE IS SO GOOD HE 
KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED THERE HE WAS 
STUCK BEHIND A TREE HE HAD THE 
CHANCE OF A BIRDIE AND IT DID NOT 
GO IN BUT HE HAS NOT DONE ANY 
DAMAGE LET THE OTHERS GOES AND 
DAMAGE OF DO SOME DAMAGE THIS HOLE IS PLAYING BY HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN YARDS TODAY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN YARDS YOU HAVE GOT TO COMMIT TO THE SHOT THAT IS BETTER THE PERFECT DISTANCE THERE IS ALWAYS DRAMA HERE AT THE 
MASTERS WERE STOPPED ALWAYS 
SOMETHING HAPPENING GETTING ON TOWARDS SIX O'CLOCK P. M. HERE THE 
FINAL GAME WENT OFF AT TWO TWENTY FIVE P. M. WE 
ARE JUST APPROACHING THE TWELFTH GREEN 
IT IS FIVE FORTY EIGHT P. M. NOT EXACTLY SPEEDY OVER THE HOGAN BRIDGE NAMED AFTER BEN HOGAN IN THE THIRD 
WEEK IN JULY HOUR OPEN CHAM BEACH 
IT WILL BE PLAYED AT ROYAL BIRKDALE 
ON THE WEST COAST NEAR SOUTHPORT THE THIRD WEEK 
IN JULY WE WILL BE IN SOUTHPORT FOR THE OPEN 
CHAMPIONSHIP THAT IS FINE COURSE 
ONE OF THE VERY BEST THE WHOLE 
TOWN OF SOUTHPORT IS VERY 
ATTRACTIVE TOO WE LOOK FORWARD TO 
SEEING YOU THERE HE MAY BE SAID IT WAS OUTSIDE RIGHT 
AND HIS CADDIE DISAGREED A POOR 
FINISH FROM IAN POULTER THAT WILL 
HURT HIM PAUL CASEY HAVING A SHOT AT THIS THIRTEENTH GREEN HIS SECOND SHOT THE LITTLE STREAM RUNS ALONG THE 
RIGHT OF THE PUTTING SURFACE AND 
ACROSS THE FRONT 
HE IS ONE UNDER 
AT THE MOMENT A COUPLE OF BIRDIES 
AND AN EAGLE HE COULD JUMP UP TO 
FOURTH SPOT IT HAS COME AWAY HE NEEDS A COUPLE OF GOOD SHOTS TO GET BACK INTO THE PICTURE JUST A LITTLE SHY IT IS NOT TOO BAD DOUBLE BOGEY ON TWELVE SET HIM BACK NO RUN AT ALL ON THAT ONE FOUR HUNDRED FORTY YARDS HUGELY UNDULATING GREEN 
LOOK WHERE TREVOR IMMELMAN IS HE 
HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL HERE IF YOU 
MOVE YOUR FEET ABOUT YOU COULD 
CAUSE THE BALL TO MOVE YOU HAVE 
GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL THIS IS AN EXTREMELY HIGH TARIFF 
SHOT IT HAS GOT HIS GOOD THE EDGE 
OF THE BUNKER FROM THE FRIDGE COVER 
FRINGE NO PRIZES FOR GOING ALONG 
GOING ALONG LONG HE DUG DEEP HE JUST CAUGHT THE 
SOFTNESS UNDER THE BALL KILLED IT 
WHEN YOU THINK THAT TIGER BALLS 
TIGER WOODS MISSED THAT PUTT HE 
COULD HAVE BEEN WITHIN ONE OR TWO 
AT THE MOMENT HE HITS IT HEAVY 
HERE HE WANTED CATCH 
IT A WEE BIT FAT IT IS ONLY HUMAN HE IS STILL IN TROUBLE TO MAKE FOUR WHAT A JUMP FROM BAKEWELL ANGEL 
JIMINEZ MIGUEL ANGEL JIMINEZ 
WELL DONE A LOT OF RYDER CUP 
POINTS THERE TOO BRANDT SNEDEKER A LONG PUTT ACROSS 
THE SCREEN ACROSS THE GREEN 
THROUGH THE SHADOWS VERY EASY TO RUN STRONG AND TO THE 
LEFT TO RIGHT PAST THE HOLE THAT 
LOOKS VERY GOOD FIRST OF THAT IS THE FIRST BREAK THAT BOY HAS HAD IN A WHILE THAT WAS A BIT QUICK HAS GONE AND GONE IMMELMAN TEN 
UNDER STEVE FLESCH SIX UNDER BRANDT SNEDEKER SEVEN UNDER 
TIGER WOODS FIVE UNDER IT IS 
BETWEEN THOSE BRANDT SNEDEKER IS UNDER HE IS CHIPPING THIS WILL STOP NOT EASY A LOT OF PRESSURE THE ONE GO GO ON THIS IS ONLY 
THE TWELFTH 
AN INTERESTING 
THE TWELFTH IT IS ALMOST GHOSTLY THERE IS NO 
CROWD HERE THEY CANNOT SEE WHERE 
THE BALL HAS GONE DOWN THE FAIRWAY 
SO IT IS VERY HUSHED 
YOU CANNOT 
EVEN GO AND MAKE A CUP OF TEA DO 
NOT LEAVE YOUR TELLY THE BALL KNEW WHERE IT WAS GOING HE MOVES INTO SECOND SPOT TIED 
WITH STEVE FLESCH AT THE MOMENT 
SIX UNDER A MIXED BAG LOTS OF FIVES NOT A FANCIABLE PUTT NO THIS IS 
TO JUST DROP THE ONE STROKE TO GIVE HIMSELF A BIT OF LEEWAY AHEAD OF THE OTHERS THERE WILL BE A LOT OF FINGERS 
CROSSED IN SOUTH AFRICA AT THE 
MOMENT GOOD NERVE I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW TRICKY THIS 
IS BOB PAUL CASEY KUFFOUR PAUL 
CASEY COMING STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE 
WATER NOW HOLD ON TO YOUR HATS IT IS O. K. WELL DONE FROM WHERE HE WAS PADRAIG HAMILTON TRYING A TIGER 
WOODS FROM SIXTEEN A WONDERFUL SHOT 
FROM PADRAIG HAMILTON THERE EVEN TODAY HE SHOULD TAP THAT ONE 
IN TWO UNDER LYING FIFTH EACH 
WAY BACKERS WILL BE ON THEIR MONEY THIS WOULD BE A MUCH NEEDED BIRDIE FOR PAUL CASEY CAN HE READ IT IT WAS HANGING THERE HE STARTED THE DAY AT SEVEN UNDER CURRENTLY DROP BACK TO ONE UNDER ONLY PLAYED HERE ONCE BUT BY THE 
END OF THE WEEK I WAS EXHAUSTED 
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY YOU ARE 
TOTALLY DRAINED LOVELY HE GETS A PAR SOME PUTT HERE TIGER ONCE AGAIN HE NEEDS TO DRAW THE 
SHOT TAKING THREE WOOD TO WORK IT ROUND THE CORNER OF THE DOGLEG HE STARTED IT TIGHT DOWN THE LEFT BUT O. K. GOOD POSITION HE IS IN ATTEMPTING SPOT DO I HAVE 
A GO FOR THE GREEN OR DO I LAY UP 
HE IS IN THAT TEMPTING SPOT HE HE HAS TO DRAW IT THE CADDIE SAID 
HANG IN THERE OH MY GOODNESS 
GRACIOUS ME THAT IS NOW PERFECTION THIS HOLE IS A LITTLE TEMPTRESS IT 
TENTED TO GO FOR THE GREEN IF YOU 
ARE BRAVE ENOUGH IT TEMPTS YOU HE IS RUNNING OUT OF HOLES TREVOR IMMELMAN AT NINE UNDER 
TIGER WOODS FOUR UNDER IF HE CAN 
HOLE THIS THAT IS NOT PRETTY AS A LEFT 
HANDER HE WILL HAVE TO STAND IN 
THE PINE NEEDLES AN INTERESTING 
HOLE IT CURVES AWAY A SLIGHT 
BANANA SHAPED RIGHT TO LEFT NO 
BUNKERS THE FAIRWAY TILTS LEFT TO 
RIGHT WHEN HE WENT TO PICK UP THE 
TEE I'M SURE HE FELT THE BALL WAS 
NICELY ON THE FAIRWAY THE GREEN IS 
FASCINATING IT LOOKS LIKE WAVES 
COMING INTO A BEACH AT NEW QUAY 
ALL SHAPES 
AND SIZES YOU CAN 
SOMETIMES HIT NOT A VERY GOOD SHOT 
AND END UP VERY CLOSE ON OTHER 
OCCASIONS IT GOES A LONG WAY AND 
YOU THINK YOU HAVE HIT A GOOD ONE 
AND THE ONE MILES AWAY YOU ARE 
MILES AWAY A THREE PUTT FROM 
TIGER LEE WESTWOOD HAS HAD A FEW 
OF THOSE THIS WEEK IT WAS SEVENTY THREE TODAY 
AND NICE WAY TO 
FINISH OVERALL WHEN YOU SUM IT UP 
LEVEL FOR THE TOURNAMENT WHAT HAVE 
BEEN THE POSITIVES 
IT IS A GOOD 
COURSE AND I AM AS COMFORTABLE AS 
I HAVE EVER FELT JUST ON THE 
GREENS I HAVE NOT MAXIMISED MY 
CHANCES TODAY L. HAVE PUTTED 
AVERAGELY I HAVE GOT TO GO AWAY 
AND WORK ON THAT AND COME BACK NEXT 
YEAR AND HOPEFULLY MY LONG GAME 
WILL BE THE SAME 
AS IT STANDS IT 
LOOKS LIKE THE GUARANTEED 
INVITATION MIGHT BE IN THE POST IT IT IS NICE TO GET THE INVITATION BACK 
IT IS ELEVEN YEARS SINCE I HAVE OH 
NO NINETEEN NINETY NINE I FINISHED SIX IT IS A 
NICE TOURNAMENT AND IT IS GOOD TO 
SECURE IT AT THE EARLIEST 
OPPORTUNITY IMMELMAN 
AT THE THIRTEENTH HAVING TO CUT AT IT OR IS HE MAYBE NOT HE HAS 
PUNCHED OUT TO THE RIGHT THAT IS 
WHERE TIGER WOODS HIT THAT VERY 
IMPRESSIVE PITCH FROM MAYBE HE 
WILL TRY TO DO THE SAME HE IS 
THREE SHOTS AHEAD SO IF HE 
FINISHES IF HE WERE TO FINISH WITH 
PARS FROM HERE ON IN THERE THE 
OTHERS WOULD HAVE TO GET FOUR 
BIRDIES TO GET PAST HIM SO HE IS 
IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE IF HE BEARS 
THAT IN MIND WHERE IS IT GOING TO GO IT HAS 
GONE THE RIGHT SIDE OF LOGS BACK 
NOW IT IS OFF IT IS THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL YOU 
PUT A SKIER ON FLAT SURFACE AND 
YOU LIFT IT UP UNTIL THE BALL MOVES 
ON ITS OWN VOLITION SPHERE THAT IS YESTERDAY 
THIS DRIVE HAS WORKED OUT WELL THIS IS A BIG MOMENT ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE YARDS THIS COULD BE THE TIME THAT HE GETS HIMSELF RIGHT BACK IN THE MIX THE WIND IS 
REALLY HOWLING THROUGH THOSE TREES AT THE BACK YOUR HEART SAYS GO BUT YOUR MIND SAYS NO WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR IT IS A REALLY INTERESTING SHOT WHEN YOU'RE 
PLAYING THAT THE BALL ABOVE YOUR 
FEET TENDS TO MAKE YOU HOOK IT SO 
YOU HOLD IT OPEN YOU TRY TO HOLD 
IT OFF WITH YOUR HANDS AND BLOCK IT 
THEY ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO GIVE 
ENCOURAGEMENT TO IMMELMAN AND TIGER 
WOODS BUT STEWART CINK HAS 
SUDDENLY CREPT IN TO THREE UNDER 
AGAIN IF TREVOR IMMELMAN DOESN'T 
WIN IT COULD BE A PLAYOFF OR AN 
ACCIDENTAL VICTORY FOR SOMEBODY IT 
WILL GO RIGHT TO THE END I FANCY 
IT IS THE THIRTEENTH TODAY AND HIS PLAYER 
NUMBER HIS THIRTEENTH YOU DON'T READ PALMS AS WELL DO YOU 
I WILL TALK TO YOU LATER ABOUT YOU IT 
THE BALL IS ABOVE THE FEET HE IT JUST HANGS BACK A LITTLE BIT THE 
WIND WHISTLING INTO HIS FACE FROM 
SLIGHTLY OFF THE LEFT INTO THE 
LITTLE BROOK 
HIS CADDIE SAID 
BETWEEN THE TWO BUNKERS HE WASN'T 
AIMING YEAR IT HE HAS GONE FIVE F. T. PAST HE DOESN'T WANT TO DROP THE CHIN 
TOO MUCH HE IS STILL VERY MUCH IN 
IT 
ARE WE GOING TO SEE A REPEAT IT PERFORMANCE FROM THE WONDERFUL SHOT 
TIGER WOODS PLAYED HE PITCHED IT 
PAST THE HOLE THERE ARE TWO 
BUNKERS ON THE RIGHT BUT HE IS 
GOING TO PITCH IT RIGHT OVER BE 
BOLD 
HE HAS GOT TO DEFEND AS WELL BOLD PARK IS A DECENT RESULT PAR IT 
IS A HUGE BONUS HAVING THAT BANK 
BEHIND HALF WAY THROUGH THE GREEN 
YOU MUSTN'T DROP IT SHORT 
HE IS A 
LITTLE ABOVE THE PUTTING SURFACE 
YOU CAN SEE THE BANK BEHIND YOU 
THE STREAM LOOMS IN FRONT OF YOU 
HE HIT A FANTASTIC SHOT YESTERDAY 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT THAT WILL DO THAT COULD BE IN IT SLOWED UP MAGNIFICENT SHOT HE MAY HAVE PUT THE SWORD TO THE REST OF THE FIELD THERE RIGHT BACK INTO THE SUN TRYING TO 
DRILL IT IN LOW SO IT DOESN'T COME 
FIZZING BACK IT WAS ABSOLUTELY 
PERFECT COME ON LOVELY HE IS THINKING YOU ARE LUCKY 
RASCAL YOU LUCKY IT IS A VERY 
STEEP BANK WE KEEP SAYING I HOPE 
IT DOESN'T ANNOY YOU TOO MUCH HOW 
DIFFERENT IT IS WHEN YOU ARE HERE 
A BIG SLOPE DOWN INTO RAE'S CREEK 
THE LITTLE STREAM THAT MEANDERS 
DOWN IN FRONT OF THE TWELFTH AND THE 
BACK OF THE ELEVENTH GREEN YOU CAN 
HARDLY SEE ANY PART OF THE GREEN AT 
ALL JUST THE TOP OF THE FLAG IT 
IS ABOUT EIGHT FEET DEEP HE CAN AFFORD TO PLAY A SIMILAR 
SHOT IF HE HAS GOT THE BANK TO USE 
A THREE PUTT FOR FLESCH 
HE WAS THE 
ONLY PLAYER NOT TO HAVE THREE 
PUTTED UNTIL THEN HIS FIRST THREE PUTT OF THE WEEK 
AT A VERY BAD TIME THERE IS NEVER 
A GOOD TIME FOR A THREE PUTT HE HAS DECIDED TO HAVE A RAPE AT RIP HE IS DOWN HILL LEFT TO RIGHT HE 
NEEDS TOUCH OF MAGIC TO GET DOWN 
YOU NEVER KNOW BUT IT IS REALLY UP 
TO IMMELMAN NOW HE TURNS TO TAKE A DROP AREA GIVE 
HIM A CLEAN SHOT UP THE GREEN AND 
A VERY NICE PITCH THAT IS FOUR HE 
HAS PLAYED ON THIS FOR PAR THIRTEENTH FOUR IF HE POTS THAT IN AND 
IMMELMAN DOES THE SAME TREVOR WILL 
BE FOUR SHOT AHEAD JUST A HANDFUL 
OF HOLES LEFT TO PLAY SADLY WE 
HEAR PAUL CASEY HAS DROPPED ANOTHER 
STROKE SEVEN OVER PAR FOR TODAY 
AND EVEN LEVEL PAR FOR THE 
TOURNAMENT IF IT FINISHES THAT WAY 
HE WILL HAVE SCORED TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT LEVEL PAR 
SEVENTY TWOS HE LOOKED MUCH BETTER THAN 
THAT BACK ONE TIME AT THIS STAGE HE LOOKS LIKE 
FOLLOWING FELLOW SOUTH AFRICAN GARY 
PLAYER IN TAKING THE GREEN JACKET 
BUT A LONG WAY TO GO THERE IS A 
BIT OF DRY LAND TO BE FOUND A FEW 
TIMES TREMENDOUS PRESSURE WINNING 
THE FIRST MAJOR WHAT IS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND UP 
THIS SORT OF TIME YOU WON THE 
USPGA THREE YEARS BACK 
WE HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT THIS THREE TIMES IN 
THE PAST AND IT IS SERIOUSLY JUST 
ONE SHOT AT THE TIME YOU CANNOT 
GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF YOU CANNOT 
START THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WILL 
DO IN YOUR PRESENTATION SPEECH IT 
IS AMAZING PIN THIS ONE THE 
PLAYERS ALWAYS MISS IT ON THAT SIDE 
HE JUST OVER READ IT IF IMMELMAN CAN MAKE HIS THAT 
WOULD GIVE IMMELMAN A FIVE SHOT 
LEAD HE WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
YARDS FOR TWO AND HE WALKS OFF WITH 
A SIX THAT IS NOT REALLY A SMILE IT IS A LEFT SIDE PUTT NOT THE 
RIGHT SIDE PUTT BUT IF YOU EVER 
COME BACK AGAIN YOU SHOULD 
REMEMBER THAT TREVOR IS TAKING AN 
AWFUL LONG TIME ON THIS ONE WELL DONE THAT IS A GOOD FOUR 
FIVE STROKES AHEAD FIVE TO PLAY 
BUT I REMEMBER IT YEARS AGO A 
PLAYER WAS THREE AHEAD WITH THREE 
HOLES TO GO AND HE ONLY NEEDED ONE 
PAR AND HE COULDN'T DO IT DO YOU 
REMEMBER THAT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT 
STAYED OUT BUT IT MANAGED TO HE HE GOT INTO THE PLAY OFF SUPER SHOT CHASING NOW A LITTLE 
BIT HAS TO FORCE A BIRDIE OR 
ILLEGAL OUT OF THE COURSE SOMETIMES THE ATMOSPHERE IS VERY 
QUIET AND IT IS ALMOST LIKE A 
CATHEDRAL HUSH AND THEN THERE ARE 
THESE HUGE ROARS 
I REMEMBER LAST 
YEAR THE FIRST THREE DAYS' WORK AS 
QUIET AS ANYTHING AND THEN ON 
SUNDAY THE WHOLE TOURNAMENT CAME TO 
LIFE IT IS A LITTLE QUIET TODAY 
WERE HIS DRIVING THIS WEEK HAS BEEN SPLENDID THE TOP SIXTEEN GET AUTOMATIC INVITES NEXT YEAR THAT WILL BE 
A ROUND OF SEVENTY TWO FOR HARRINGTON WELL DONE HE HAS MADE HIMSELF INTO A VERY FINE PROFESSIONAL GOLFER NOW 
VERY GOOD PLAY HE WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED WHEN HE IS HAVING 
LOOK AT THE BIG SCORE BOARD AND 
THINKING MIGHT HAVE DONE THIS 
MIGHT HAVE DONE THAT BUT NOT BAD JUST A PAR HE HAS MADE FIVES AT 
THE THIRTEENTH PAR FIVE ON THE FIFTEENTH 
THOSE ARE THE HOLES THAT YOU 
NORMALLY GOBBLES UP HE IMMELMAN MAKING THE WALK UP THE 
FOURTEENTH FAIRWAY RIGHT AT THE BACK IN 
THE MIDDLE THE BALL TENDS TO 
FUNNEL DOWN L. APOLOGISE FOR THE 
LOSS OF PICTURE PUTT BUT I'M SURE 
OUR TECHNICIANS WILL HAVE IT BACK 
UP IN A MOMENT PICTURE THE 
WIND IS REALLY SWIRLING AROUND HERE 
TODAY CAUSING THE PLAYERS A LOT OF 
TROUBLE 
WHEN YOU CAME HERE TO 
AUGUSTA I READ QUOTES THAT YOU 
SAID YOU WERE NOT EXPECTING GREAT 
THINGS YOU WOULD JUST GOING TO 
ENJOY THE WEEK IT IS ALMOST 
LOOKING LIKE TOP TEN FINISH HAVE 
YOU ACHIEVE THAT 
I HAVE REALLY 
ENJOYED THE WEEK L. LEARNED A LOT 
FROM LAST YEAR WHEN I PLAYED HERE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS 
COURSE IS SO MUCH ABOUT ENJOYING IT 
THE FUNNY THING WHEN THE BALL 
COMES BACK TO YOUR FEET THERE IS 
SO MUCH ABOUT KEEPING YOUR HEAD IN 
THE RIGHT PLACE AND HAVING FUN AND 
TAKING IT AS IT COMES IT IS SUCH A 
CHALLENGING WEEK BUT IT IS GOOD 
IT WAS LOVELY TO SEE YOU EXPRESSING 
YOURSELF AGAIN THERE WERE A COUPLE 
OF LONG PUTTS OF WHICH ONE WENT IN 
IT WAS A CRACKER 
I WAS SURPRISED 
MYSELF I DON'T USUALLY DO THAT 
SORT OF THING L. JUST GOT A BIT 
CARRIED AWAY BUT IT WAS GOOD FUN I I HOPE YOU WILL ENJOY COMING BACK 
HERE NEXT YEAR 
IT WAS GREAT THERE 
SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE TOP SIXTEEN 
SHOULDN'T IT IT WILL WELL DONE THIS IS 
THE FIFTEENTH STEVE FLESCH THIRD SHOT NOT EASY HE IS STILL TIED FOR SECOND FLESCH THE BALL TENDS TO SKIP FORWARD DOWN THE BREEZE NOT TOO BAD THERE THE PERFECT TEE SHOT FOR IMMELMAN HE WANTS AROUND SEVEN OR EIGHT NICE CLEAN SHOTS AND THAT WILL DO HIM STEADY THAT IS ALL RIGHT IF THAT 
HAD STAYED ON THE GREEN IT WOULD 
PROBABLY HAVE ENDED UP RIGHT ON THE 
BOTTOM END BUT IT JUST STAYED IN 
THE LONGER GRASS STRAIGHT AT IT TREMENDOUS SHOT HE WILL BE THINKING TWO THREE THREE FINISH WATCH THE TRAJECTORY MILES IN THE 
AIR IT COMES DOWN VERY STEEPLY 
THAT IS THE ABILITY HE HAS THE 
BALL DROPPING OUT OF THE SKY LIKE A 
STONE A LOT OF SPIN OUTSTANDING 
SHOT HUGE CROWDS GATHER ROUND HERE AND 
THEY HAVE SEEN SOME SPECTACULAR 
ONES BUT NONE MORE MEMORABLE THAN 
TIGER WOODS OH MY GOODNESS IN YOUR LIFE HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT WAS A BIT HEAVY HANDED HE IS 
BEGINNING TO UNRAVEL A LITTLE BIT 
I FEARED HE MIGHT I THINK IT HAS STOPPED TAKE A SEAT WE SHOULD SAY WELL DONE TO ANDRES 
ROMERO THE YOUNG PLAYER FROM 
ARGENTINA HE FINISHED AT ONE UNDER 
PAR HE MADE SOME VERY GOOD EFFORT 
HE MIGHT WELL HAVE WON THE OPEN AT 
CARNOUSTIE LAST YEAR HE HAS WON A 
TOURNAMENT HERE ON THE REGULAR 
TOURNAMENT ALREADY AND HE IS A 
VERY INTERESTING PLAYER TO WATCH A NICE RUN OF PARS WILL DO IT 
SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT SO EASY TO 
DO HE HAS PLAYED IN EIGHT TOURNAMENTS 
OVER HERE THIS YEAR HE HAS MISSED 
THE CUT FOUR TIMES THIS IS SHOWING A REALLY GOOD CONSISTENCY AND FORM HERE GOOD SPEED TIDY TIDY HE HAD A 
OPERATION I THINK IT WAS IN 
DECEMBER WHEN HE HAD A TUMOUR 
THEY WERE A BIT WORRIED ABOUT IT 
FOR A WHILE BUT IT WAS BENIGN HE 
IS ON THE COMEBACK TRAIL HE MADE A BIT OF A HASH OF THAT TIGER WOODS IS NOW TIED FOR SECOND THAT WAS FOR OUTRIGHT SECOND THE 
LAST FEW HOLES HE HAS HAD A FEW 
PUTTS THAT HAVE JUST SKIMMED BY I HAD SNEDEKER BACK AT FOUR UNDER 
ALTHOUGH THAT IS A BOGEY WHICH HAS 
BROUGHT HIM BACK TO FOUR UNDER 
THINGS ARE LOOKING RATHER NICE FOR 
TREVOR IMMELMAN WHAT A NICE FEELING WITH FOUR TO GO 
HE HAS GOT TO GET OVER THE FIFTEENTH 
HOLE HE CAN AFFORD TO PLAY A 
CONSERVATIVE PAR FIVE 
ON THE FIFTEENTH STEWART CINK IS SUDDENLY LEAPING THROUGH THE FIELD FOUR PLAYERS ARE FOUR UNDER NOW BUT SIX BEHIND IMMELMAN BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JUST BEING ON THE FAIRWAY AND THAT FIRST CUT OF ROUGH TREVOR IS ABLE TO PLAY THESE HOLES VERY CONSERVATIVELY NICELY DONE YESTERDAY HE HAD 
GOLF'S GREATEST EVER BREAK WHEN HE 
PITCHED WITH HIS THIRD IT WENT 
DOWN DEAN BANK AND HE SOMEHOW 
MANAGED TO SNAG THERE DOWN THE 
BANK FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY YARDS DIRECTED BACK INTO THE BREEZE HAVE A LOOK AT THIS FIFTEENTH HOLE PAR 
FIVE HAS BEEN LENGTHENED OVER THE 
YEARS PINE TREES HAVE BEEN PUT UP 
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IT USED TO BE 
A LOT WIDER THOSE PINE TREES WILL 
BACK FIFTEEN YARDS IT HAS FORCED 
PLAYERS MORE TO THE LEFT BUT THE 
IDEA IS TO TRY AND GET IT AS CLOSE 
TO THE RIGHT EDGE OF THE FAIRWAY AS 
POSSIBLE THEN YOU HAVE DOWNHILL 
SHOT OVER THE WATER IT IS 
TREACHEROUS GREEN TREVOR IMMELMAN 
IS JUST BACK BEHIND THESE TREES HE 
JUST HAS TO HAVE LITTLE DRAW WITH 
A SEVEN IRON IT IS SEVERELY DOWN 
SLOPING THE PITCH ACROSS THE LAKE 
CAN BE DANGEROUS HE HAS HAD A GREAT RUN ALL WEEK 
THIS WAS AT THE NINTH IT JUST CREPT 
IN THE SIDE DOOR TOOK HIM TO STAY 
AT TEN UNDER THIS WAS AT THE ELEVENTH 
TO SAVE HIS PAR IN THAT ONE POPPED IF THERE WAS A HUGE CHEER THE TWELFTH WAS A TRICKY ONE THERE 
WERE GREAT PUTTS AT NINE ELEVEN AND TWELVE 
HE HIT A SUPER PITCH INTO THE THIRTEENTH 
AND A DELICATE ONE LEFT HE SINGLE 
PUTTED THE FOURTEENTH HE HAS GIVEN 
HIMSELF GREAT CUSHION SEE HOW HARD THE WIND IS BLOWING 
THAT SECOND SHOT WAS STRAIGHT DOWN 
BREEZE NOT HAPPY TIGER HAS HAD HIS UPS AND DOWNS 
TODAY THAT WAS AT THE FOURTH HOLE 
THE THIRTEENTH FOR A BIRDIE DRILLED IT 
STRAIGHT LEFT THIS WAS HIS SECOND 
PUTT AT THE FOURTEENTH GOOD STRIKE BUT 
IT WAS JUST OF CENTRE THE FIFTEENTH 
AGAIN THAT WAS FOR A BIRDIE 
USUALLY HE PUTTS SO WELL 
PARTICULARLY AT MOMENTS OF TENSION 
BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN LIKE THAT THIS 
WEEK ALTHOUGH HE HAS HOLED A FEW 
GOOD ONES THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT FAR RIGHT IT CUTS THE ANGLE DOWN NEIL WALLACE'S CADDIE HE WAS CADDIE FOR ME ONES GOOD TO 
SEE HE GOT OVER THE EXPERIENCE 
ONCE WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WILL HIT HERE SIX IRON NUDGE IT DOWN THE FAIRWAY HE HAS HAD SUCH GOOD BALANCE ALL WEEK 
THAT IS MORE THE POSITION THE WEEK PLAYERS TRIED TO GETTING THIS WAS IMMELMAN'S THIRD SHOT ON 
FIFTEEN SAND WEDGE BUT HE DID NOT 
CARRY IT FAR ENOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS WET AND I DO 
NOT KNOW HOW THIS STOPPED BUT IT 
DID I HAVE NEVER SEEN A ON THAT 
BANK NEVER SEEN A ON BANK HE WAS NOT SURE IT WAS GOING TO HOLD HE CANNOT BELIEVE IT CHECKING THE YARDAGE BOOK THE PIN IS IN ITS MOST GENEROUS SPOT ON THE BACK RIGHT THAT WAS A BIGAMIST TO RIGHT BRILLIANT SHOT THEY HAVE BEEN FLYING OUT THE 
WINDOW AT A GREAT PACE COME OUT 
THESE SHOTS ON THE BACK NINE HE MAKES IT LOOK SO EASY FIRST TO PLAY WILL BE SNEDEKER FROM THE RIGHT HALF OF THE FAIRWAY AGAIN A GOOD LINE DEFENDING CHAMPION JOHNSON FINISHES UP HE HAD A COUPLE OF GOOD ROUNDS THREE OVER JUST TO FINISH OFF ON THE FINAL HOLE HE PLAYED THAT WONDERFULLY HE DID 
NOT HAVE THE BETTER OF THE ANGLES 
THAT WAS GOOD SHOT THEY ONLY WONDER WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN IF HE GETS PAST THIS HOLE HE SHOULD BE WELL AND TRULY IN CONTROL HE IS BOUND TO BE PLAYING IT A 
LITTLE BIT BACK TO MAKE SURE IT IS 
BALL FIRST HE HAS DREAMT ABOUT 
THIS PRACTISED FOUR HOURS IF HE 
CAN FIND DRY LAND HERE HE IS 
NEARLY THERE SO WAS DEVON LOCH IN THE GRAND NATIONAL SPLENDID SHOT HE IS DOING VERY 
WELL TWENTY NINE YEARS OF AGE AND FROM A 
STRONG GOLFING FAMILY I AM SURE HE CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT 
HAS HAPPENED TO HIM TODAY BUT HE 
IS A FANTASTIC PLAYER CASEY HE 
WILL BE BACK AGAIN RIGHT NOW THERE 
IS NO CONSOLING HIM SO FAR WE HAVE HAD A GREAT DANE BUT 
MAYBE THERE IS MORE ACTION TO COME 
GREAT DAY OF I THINK WE KNOW NOW ON WILL BE 
CLAIMING THAT GREEN JACKET AT THE 
END OF THE EVENING TREVOR IMMELMAN I THINK HE HAS GOT ONE OF THE 
BUTTONS DONE UP ON THE GREEN JACKET 
BUT NOT QUITE THERE YET IMMELMAN'S FATHER IS THE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN TOUR HIS 
BROTHER AS A PROFESSIONAL IN FOR 
HIS PAR ONE MORE TICKED OFF TIGER HIS FINAL WRATH CLATTERED IN THE TREES AND IT DROPS 
OUT OF THE TREES NO GRAND SLAM FOR 
TIGER THIS YEAR WELL DONE FIVE UNDER ONLY TWO PLAYERS HAVE BROKEN SEVENTY 
SLOCUM AND JIMENEZ 
IT IS A TOUGH 
COURSE BUT IN GENERAL THE P. G. A. TOUR 
HAS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE PACE 
OF PLAY ONE AGREE BIG SLOPE LIKE A HOG'S BACK RUNS 
DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREEN YOU 
CAN GO FOR THE PIN ON THE TOP LEVEL 
THE BOTTOM LEVEL BACK LEFT IS THE 
FINAL DAY'S POSITION IT IS PRETTY 
WELL EXACTLY THE SAME SPOT AS IT 
WAS LAST YEAR BACK LEFT BACK 
RIGHT I HAVE SEEN IT RIGHT FRONT 
THIS WEEK BUT YOU CAN COME IF 
YOU'RE LUCKY PLAY RIGHT AND END UP 
VERY CLOSE CARRIED IT TOO FAR TREVOR IT DOES NOT WANT TO GO BEYOND THE FLAG THE RED LINE SHOWS YOU THE BALL FLIGHT THE LINE WAS GOOD IT WAS JUST A BIT TOO STRONG VERY POPULAR ALL THIS FOR NEARLY WAS SHOTS VERY POPULAR HOLE HE WE GO WHAT WOULD BE YOUR CHOICE 
OF CLUB WAYNE 
I THINK ABOUT SIX 
IRON ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN YARDS IT IS BACK INTO 
THE BREEZE THIS IS THE ONLY REALLY DANGEROUS 
SHOT HE HAS GOT 
THE WIND JUST 
BUFFETING IT A BIT IT IS PROBABLY 
JUST A LITTLE LEFT RIGHT TREVOR'S 
NEAREST COMPETITOR IS MINUS FIVE 
SNEDEKER HE IS IN A BIT OF TROUBLE 
HE HAS GOT ABOUT NINE YARDS TO AIM 
AT THE BALL WILL GATHER TO THE 
HOLE SIDE WHAT ARE YOU DOING I THINK THAT IS 
IN THE SAND NOT IN THE WATER L. 
DON'T SUPPOSE HE MEANT TO DO IT 
BUT THERE IS PLENTY OF GREEN FRONT 
HE WANTS TO KNOW IF IT IS IN THE 
WATER 
IT IS IN THE WATER 
HE IS WATER NOT SURE IT MUST HAVE GONE AND THE WATER IT 
DOES NOT MATTER BECAUSE IT IS ALL 
YELLOW ROUND THERE 
I FOUND THAT 
HARD TO BELIEVE FOR SOMEBODY WHO 
HAS PLAYED SO WELL TO MISS THIRTY YARDS 
HE HAS GOT THE WHOLE OF YARDS GEORGIA TO THE RIGHT 
HE SHOULD BE 
O. K. IF HE POPS IT ON THE GREEN 
TAKES FIVE IT JUST MAKES YOU A BIT 
SHAKY ESPECIALLY IF THE OTHER 
FELLOW HAS A FLUKE AND SINCE IT 
FIERY TWO SINCE IT FOR A TWO 
THIS IS THE THING ABOUT MAJOR 
TOURNAMENTS WE ARE SO USED TO 
TIGER BEING CLINICAL AND MAKING FEW 
MISTAKES AND THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE 
DON'T HE WAS JUST TRYING TO HOLD IT OFF 
AND HE HAS DOUG LACROSSE IT HE HE WATCHED IT SO INTENTLY I FELT SURE 
IT WAS ON LINE 
HE WAS HOPING FOR 
THE MIDDLE OF THE BUNKER 
HE HAS 
SUDDENLY PUT HIMSELF UNDER ENORMOUS 
PRESSURE FROM ABSOLUTELY KNOW WHERE 
HE IS TAKING LONGER AND LONGER 
WHAT HAS HE GONE NOW ONE HUNDRED YARDS HE HE IS JUST AT THE FRONT OF THE TEE I 
THINK HE HAS GOT CLOSER TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY WE REALLY NEED SOMETHING A BIT 
SPECIAL HERE PAUL CADDIE TRYING TO 
LOOK THAT IS O. K. HE HAS PLAYED THREE TWO PUTTS FOR 
A FIVE THAT IS TWO SHOTS GONE IF IF SNEDEKER CAN DO SOMETHING 
MIRACULOUS THE PLOT WILL THICKEN DEFENDING CHAMPION CLOSING HIS 
ACCOUNT FOR THIS YEAR HE HAD A 
WONDERFUL THIRD DAY BUT THE WIND 
GOT THE BETTER OF HIM TODAY TRYING AS HARD AS YOU CAN SHE GET 
THAT OUT OF HIS HEAD NOW AS HARD 
AS HE CAN TO GET THAT OUT OF HIS 
HEAD A BIT SHORT OF PACE 
AND DIRECTION BUT NOT BAD EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING DAY FOR TIGER HE HAD A PUTT TO GET TO FIVE UNDER AND IF HE HOLES IT IT COULD STILL 
BE INTERESTING IT COULD STILL BE 
VERY INTERESTING HE HAS HAD HIS 
CHANCES TODAY AND FEW OTHERS COULD 
SAY THE SAME THE BALL AWAY WOULD YOU BELIEVE 
IT FINISHES WITH THREE THAT IS 
A ROUND A SEVENTY TWO FIVE UNDER PAR AND 
WITH IMMELMAN PROBABLY GOING TO 
DROP TWO STROKES ON THE SIXTEENTH HE 
WILL ONLY BE THREE BEHIND IT 
COULDN'T HAPPEN COULD IT TIGER 
MISSED THREE OF FOUR PUTTS THE 
LONGEST ONE WAS PROBABLY NINE FEET THIS WAS BEFORE TIGER STEWART 
CINK'S ATTEMPT THAT BIRDIE THAT 
WILL BE FOUR UNDER HE HAS HAD A GOOD SOLID WEEK HE HAS HAD A VERY GOOD YEAR THE WOES CONTINUE HE DID SAY AT 
THE ELEVENTH THIS IS AN INSULTING 
POSITION HE MAKES A LOT OF MONEY 
BUT HE JUST HASN'T GOT IT AND 
EXULTING POSITION HE STRUCK IT WELL BACK TO EIGHT UNDER THAT WOBBLED AND BOBBLED BUT IT DID 
NOT SLOW IT DOWN MUCH AND IT WAS 
ALMOST OFF THE GREEN THINK OUR 
DIRECTOR OF OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS 
IS PLAYING GOLF HERE ERIC 
MORECAMBE GOLF ALL THE RIGHT SHOTS 
BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE RIGHT ORDER HE BELTED IT STRAIGHT THROUGH 
TIGER WOODS IS NOW LYING SECOND AND 
IMMELMAN ONLY HAS THREE SHOT CUSHION WITH TWO HOLES TO PLAY HALF A MILE BETWEEN IMMELMAN AND A GREEN JACKET WELL DONE ABOUT TIME SEVEN OVER FOR HIS ROUND EVEN PAR IT IS NOT QUITE OVER TWO HOLES TO PLAY LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE SEVENTEENTH HOLE 
FOUR HUNDRED FORTY YARDS YOU HAVE TO THREAD THE 
BALL OVER THESE TREES A VERY 
NARROW FAIRWAY THESE DAYS IT USED 
TO BE SIXTY YARDS WIDE BUT HAS BEEN 
REDUCED TO THIRTY A BIT DECEPTIVE WITH THIS FRONT 
BUNKER THAT DECEIVES YOU THAT IS 
YESTERDAY'S PIN POSITION AT THE 
PIN TODAY CUT JUST OVER THE RIGHT 
HAND TRACK AND A VERY AWKWARD SPOT PERFECT TEE SHOT RIGHT IN THE 
MIDDLE COME ON TREVOR SUBTLE 
EVERYTHING DOWN STILL A THREE SHOT 
LEAD BRANDT SNEDEKER SIX UNDER IS THE BEST HE CAN HOPE FOR TREVOR HAD A SIX SHOT LEAD AT ONE 
STAGE WITH TWO TO GO THAT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN DEAD SAVE BUT THREE 
SHOTS CAN MATHEMATICALLY IT IS 
STILL POSSIBLE HE HAS GO AND A LOT OF DRIVES 
STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE THIS WEEK 
HE HAS TWO MORE AT SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN AND 
HE WILL BE HOME AND DRY 
IT LOOKED LIKE WITH A GREAT BIRDIE 
PUTT AT ELEVEN YOU COULD PUT SOMETHING 
TOGETHER WHAT WERE YOU THINKING I I THOUGHT IF I PLAYED THE LAST SEVEN 
HOLES THREE AND A PAR I MIGHT BE 
IN IT BUT I DID NOT MAKE ANY PUTTS 
ALL WEEK L. HIT THE BALL WELL 
ENOUGH TO PUT PRESSURE ON TREVOR 
BACK THERE BUT I DID NOT MAKE ANY 
PUTTS 
THE SHORT EFFORT AT FOURTEEN THE PUTTS BOGEY THERE 
ALL WEEK I WAS 
STRUGGLING I WAS NOT RELEASING 
WOBBLES NOT GETTING THE SPIN THAT I 
NORMALLY DO CONSEQUENTLY YOU PAY 
THE PRICE 
THREE BACK WHAT WE YOU 
DO NOW 
AM HUNGRY RIGHT NOW I AM 
HUNGRY TREVOR SHOULD BE ABLE TO 
GET INTO THE CLUB HOUSE TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY ONE THIRTY THIRTY THAT IS TIGER 
WOODS'S PUTTS CERTAINLY NOT HIS 
BETS BEST BUT IT IS NOT ALL 
OVER UNTIL THE FAT LADY SINGS NOW NOW YOU MAKE ONE WE HAVE 
ALL HAD THOSE DAYS YOU MAKE ONE AT THE END WHEN IT IS ALL TOO LATE AS THE SUN IS SETTING 
ON THE FINAL ROUND OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
MASTER'S CHAMPIONSHIP TREVOR 
IMMELMAN IS THREE AHEAD OF TIGER 
WOODS BRANDT SNEDEKER IS FOUR UNDER HE GOT A GOOD DRIVE AWAY THERE BUT 
BE FEATURED END UP IN A TIE AND HE 
DOES NOT WIN TREVOR IMMELMAN IT 
COULD AFFECT HIS GOLFING LIFE FOUR 
YEARS TO COME IT HAS HAPPENED 
BEFORE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN THE 
POSITION TO WIN WISH HIM NOTHING 
BUT GOOD THINGS BUT HE HAS GOT TO 
BE CAREFUL AND PLAY PROPERLY PAUL CASEY HAS GOT IT UP ON THE TOP HERE A DIFFICULT PUTT VIRTUALLY SIDEWAYS IT GRAVITY TAKE ITS COURSE LET GRAVITY HE CANNOT WAIT TO GET OFF THE COURSE HE NEED THAT TO REMAIN EVEN PAR AND A TIE FOR ELEVENTH WE HAD A NUMBER OF OUR YOUNG GUNS 
STEPPING UP ON THIS FINAL DAY AND 
APART FROM PADRAIG HARRINGTON AND 
ROBERT KARLSSON AND MIGUEL ANGEL 
JIMINEZ SOME OF OUR BIG BOYS HAVE 
NOT PERFORMED VERY WELL IT IS DISAPPOINTING CERTAINLY FOR THEM THE FRONT PIN AND THE BREEZE NOT EASY TO HOLD THE BALL BY THE FLAG GOOD PUTT PAUL CASEY A 
DISAPPOINTING DAY A ROUND OF SEVENTY NINE 
EVEN PAR FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP TIED 
FOR ELEVENTH HAS HE PICKED THE RIGHT CLUB ONE OF THE POOREST CIOTTI HAS HIT 
ALL WEEK SHOTS HE HAS HIT TWO TWO PARS FOR A SEVENTY SEVEN THE BACK NINE HAS 
BEEN VERY EXPENSIVE FOR HIM THE SECOND SHOT HERE HE MUST GET OVER THAT 
FRONT BUNKER HE DOES NOT WANT TO PUT IT IN THE FRONT BUNKER THAT IS THE ONLY 
SPORT HE CAN GIVE HIMSELF MISCHIEF IN THE ONLY SPOT WE TALKED ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT GOOD SHOTS AND NO THREE PUTTS AT LEAST THE BALL IS SITTING NICELY BUT THIS IS A DELICATE SHOT WE 
HAVE SEEN ONE OR TWO GOOD SHOTS 
FROM THERE BUT THERE IS STILL A 
HOLE AND A HALF TO GO WHEN YOU SEE 
SOMETHING ON RATTLING LIKE THIS IT 
IS PAINFUL ON BAFFLING UNRAVELLING WHAT DID YOU THINK AT THIS POINT 
DID YOU THINK SOMETHING WAS 
HAPPENING 
IT IS JUST IN THE ROUGH HAPPENING ONLY AN INCH OR SO ALONG THE ROUGH 
BUT ENOUGH TO MAKE SOLID CONTACT 
QUITE DIFFICULT THAT WAS ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE BALL TO COME UP SOFT THE GOOD THING HERE IF HE DOES NOT 
TRY TO BE TOO SILLY LET'S WATCH 
STEVE FLESCH FINISH OFF HOME IN FORTY TWO THE LAST MAN STANDING WILL COME ON AFTER 
THE GOLF WE HAVE GOT OUR OWN VERSION OF THAT HERE LOOK WHERE THAT BALL HAS ENDED UP WAY DOWN THERE A FINE PITCH FROM BRANDT SNEDEKER IT LOOKS LIKE THE BEST THAT BOUNCE THE VICAR CAN DO IS PAR AT SEVENTEEN AND 
A BIRDIE AT EIGHTEENTH SO MINUS FIVE IS 
THE TARGET FOR TREVOR IMMELMAN 
THIS IS NO PUSHOVER OF A BUNKER 
SHOT THE GOOD THING IF HE SETTLES FOR A 
FIVE NOW AND FIVE AT THE LAST HE 
WILL WIN BY SHOT IF HE TRIES TO BE TOO FANCY LOOKOUT THAT WILL DO THE EXTRA CAUTION IF HE CAN HOLE 
THAT ONE 
AT LEAST IT IS GIVING US 
SOMETHING TO STILL TALK ABOUT 
ABSOLUTELY YOU REMEMBER ARNOLD 
PALMER A FEW YEARS AGO HE CAME 
HERE AT THE EIGHTEENTH BEAUTIFUL DRIVE 
FOUR TO WIN A FIGHT TO TIE HE 
TOOK SIX YES HE ACTUALLY STOPPED SOME 
QUITE CONGRATULATED HIM SOME GUY 
ACCELERATING THE CLUB HEAD THROUGH 
THE SAND ACCELERATE THE CLUB HEAD THROUGH THE SAND WELL DONE BRANDT SNEDEKER ARNOLD 
PALMER ONE OF HIS FRIENDS GRABBED 
HIM GOING TO THE EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY AND 
SHOOK HIS HAND AND CONGRATULATED 
HIM TO WIN THAT TIME WHEN HE TOOK 
THE DOUBLE BOGEY ON THE LAST HE 
LEARNED A VERY HARD LESSON 
ABSOLUTELY GARY PLAYER AND THINK 
IT WAS WHO ONE HE WILL BE VERY KEEN TO KNOCK THIS IN TO GIVE HIMSELF AN EXTRA CAUTION BUT IF HE GIVES THIS A BIT TOO MUCH 
SPEED AND CATCHES THE TOP EDGE OF 
THE HOLE 
BOTH YOU ARE MAKING ME 
NERVOUS OF BUT IT IS TRUE HE HE COULD THREE PUT FROM HERE HIDE BEHIND THE SOFA THIS WILL 
MAKE THE LAST SO MUCH MORE 
COMFORTABLE 
IF HE HOLES THIS IT COMFORTABLE WILL BE NICELY NICELY THE RELIEF IS ENORMOUS A LEAD OF THREE GOING UP THE LAST 
HE HAS DRIVEN THE BALL SO 
BEAUTIFULLY ALL WEEK SO JUST ONE 
MORE JUST ONE MORE GOOD CLEAN HIT 
UP THE LAST HOLE I AM TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT THAT 
HEAD COVER IS IT IS QUITE STRANGE 
FOR US 
HE DOES NOT HAVE ONE OF 
THOSE BIG SQUARE HEADED PUTTERS YOU FEEL HE IS BATTLING WITH 
HIMSELF MENTALLY 
YES HE ESCHEWED 
UP A BIT AT THIS MINUTE HE IS 
DUE DUP WE HAVE WATCHED HIM PLAY 
SINCE HE WAS A TEENAGER VERY 
PRECOCIOUS TALENT THERE IS TIGER WOODS SITTING UP THERE IT LOOKS FOR ALL THE WORLD AS IF HE WILL FINISH NO WORSE THAN SECOND THE FINAL TEE SHOT FOR BRANDT 
SNEDEKER SOUNDS LIKE IT IS GOING 
RIGHT SEEMS TO HAVE SAT DOWN HE WILL HAVE HIS PROBLEMS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YARDS TO REACH THE LEFT 
HAND BUNKER THE BREEZE IS 
BASICALLY LEFT TO RIGHT THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE TO CLEAN 
YOUR MIND OUT AND THINK ABOUT THE 
JOB IN HAND IT IS VERY EASY TO GET 
ALL SORTS OF ODD THOUGHTS AT THIS 
MOMENT AND REMEMBER ALL OF THOSE GOOD 
DRIVE YOU HAVE IT YOU JUST NEED 
ONE MORE THOSE GOOD DRIVES YOU HAVE HIT HE'S PLEASED TO SEE THAT ONE COMING RIGHT UP THE MIDDLE HIS MAJESTIC DRIVING HAS BEEN THE 
KEY A COUPLE OF MISCUES A BIT OF 
NERVE BUT THAT IS A VERY GOOD 
POSITION HE CAN AFFORD TO TAKE 
PLENTY OF CLUB PITCH IT IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE GREEN HE SHOULD BE 
O. K. PADRAIG HARRINGTON HAS BEEN 
FINISHED SOME TIME NOW BUT A GOOD 
FINAL ROUND FOR HIM 
ANOTHER VERY STRONG 
SHOWING HERE AT AUGUSTA YOUR THIRD 
TOP TEN L. WONDER HOW YOU WILL LOOK 
BACK ON IT ALL 
I WILL REFLECT ON 
THE FACT THAT MY SHORT GAME WAS NOT 
UP TO IT THIS WEEK L. HIT A LOT OF 
POOR CHIP SHOTS TODAY L. COULD HAVE 
PLAYED AN FOUR SHOTS BETTER IT IS 
TREVOR IMMELMAN'S WEEK THIS WEEK 
HE DESERVED TO WIN L. DON'T FEEL 
LIKE IN ANY SENSE THIS IS ONE THAT 
GOT AWAY L. AM CONFIDENT THAT I AM 
GETTING BETTER AND I CAN BRING MY 
GAME TO THE BIG OCCASION THE 
BIGGER GOLF COURSES SUIT ME L. MUCH 
PREFERRED GOING OUT THERE WHEN I 
KNEW IT WAS A PATIENT WEEK AND IT 
IS GRINDING OUT RATHER THAN A 
SPRINT MAJORS ARE WHAT IS ALL 
ABOUT I AM COMFORTABLE THAT I CAN 
BRING MY GAME MAYBE NOT EVERY 
MAJOR BY PLAYING BUT IT I CAN 
BRING IT IN FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TIME I CAN 
CONVERT A FEW OF THOSE AND WIN SOME 
MORE 
IF IT DOES STAY THE 
SAME AND TREVOR GOES ON TO CLAIM 
THE GREEN JACKET GIVE US YOUR 
PERSPECTIVE ON HIS ABILITIES AND 
HOW DIFFICULT THE TASK IT HAS BEEN 
TO LEAD FROM DAY ONE UNTIL THE LAST 
IT HAS NOT BEEN DONE FOR A LONG 
TIME RAYMOND WAS THE LAST ONE TO 
DO IT WE ALL KNOW HOW TALENTED 
TREVOR IS HE HAS HAD SOME BAD 
BREAKS WITH ILLNESSES BUT WE KNOW 
THE TALENT HE HAS GOT WE ALL SIT 
OUT THERE AND HOW WELL HE CAN PLAY 
IT IS A MATTER OF TIME AND 
EXPERIENCE JUST LIKE TODAY MIGHT 
BE HIS DAY 
HE HAS MADE HARD WORK OF IT 
IN THE 
LAST FORTY FIVE MINUTES OR SO WE SHOULD BE 
FINISHED NOW BUT IT IS QUITE 
EXTRAORDINARY EVERY DAY WE HAVE 
BEEN RUNNING LATE ONES BECAUSE OF 
WEATHER CONDITIONS BUT I REALLY DO 
THINK THE POWERS THAT BE NEED TO 
THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE TIMING OF 
THIS EVENT AND INDEED ALL BIG 
MAJOR EVENTS WITH NOBODY IN YOUR WAY PLENTY OF 
PEOPLE TO FIND YOU THE BALL IT IS 
RIDICULOUS SNEDEKER IS TRYING TO FIND THE 
EXACT YARDAGE WITH HIS CADDIE 
THERE IS THE LEFT TO 
RIGHT HE HAS GOT TO HIT A BIT OF 
FADE ON THIS OF ABOUT FIFTEEN YARDS IF HE HOLES IT IT IS SIX UNDER I'M STARTING TO FANTASISE A LITTLE HE HAD A GOOD FLICK OFF 
THE TREES HE COULD HAVE BEEN FAR WORSE THAT WAS A GREAT SHOT ANYTHING ON THE GREEN WAS GOOD NOW TREVOR HAS 
MADE SURE HE HAS DROPPED HIS 
YARDAGE HE HAS MADE NEIL CHECK IT 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE YARDAGE 
OVER THE BUNKER OH NO IT JUST DOESN'T STOP DOES IT 
I DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE IT ALLOWED HERE BUT THAT MAY IN A 
FUNNY WAY HELP HIM IF HE IS GOING 
IN THE DIRECTION HE WANTS A BIT 
MORE CONCENTRATION AND BELT INTO 
THE BACK OF IT DRIVE DOWN AND 
THROUGH IT 
NO ONE CAN CATCH HIM IF 
HE TAKES THE SIX BUT THAT IS 
MISERABLE IF IT IS NEAR THE BACK END HE CAN 
GET RIGHT DOWN ON THE BALL A GOOD 
PUNCH INTO THE HEART OF THE GREEN 
THERE ARE A FEW OPTIONS L. SUPPOSE 
THE ONLY THING HE CAN DO IS WIPE IT 
IN THE FACE OF THE BUNKER AT THE 
FRONT GO UNDERGROUND AND MAKE LIFE 
DIFFICULT FOR HIMSELF BUT HE COULD 
LAY UP AND CHIP IT BOMB ON THAT 
WILL DO UMPTEEN PUTTS TO WIN I THINK WE WILL SEE LITTLE BIT OF A MOTION 
WHEN THE FLAG FINALLY GOES INTO 
THIS HOLE FOR THE LAST TIME 
EMOTION IT WAS A HORRID LOOKING 
SHOT BUT THE BALL WAS IN THE FAR 
END HE DRILLED RIGHT DOWN INTO THE 
SANDY SUBSOIL THE RESULT 
EXCELLENT WHO'S HE BETTING DOWN A FAMILY FRIEND HIS WIFE THERE IS HIS FATHER VERY PROUD A 
NICE TOUCH CALLING SNEDEKER TO 
WALK UP ONTO THE GREEN TOGETHER 
GARY PLAYER WON THIS WONDERFUL 
EVENT THE GREAT FEELING A 
ANOTHER NICE TOUCH HE HOLDS BACK 
TO LET IMMELMAN TAKE CENTRE STAGE 
THAT IS WHAT SETS GOLF APART I 
SUPPOSE FROM MANY OTHER GAMES IT 
IS JUST FUNNY LITTLE OLD FASHIONED 
COURTESIES THAT GO ON THAT JUST 
MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IT 
IS CALLED CLASS YOU WILL GET SOME NEW SHOES NOW 
A NICE LITTLE TOUCH IAN JACOB WITH 
THE MASTERS SHUT ON SHIRT VERY 
NICE IT HAS BEEN A DIFFERENT SORT 
OF WEEK VERY INTERESTING GOLF THE 
COURSE IS ALMOST WON CONDITIONS 
HAVE BEEN TRICKY THERE IS ALWAYS 
SOMETHING OR NEARLY ALWAYS 
SOMETHING SPECIAL THAT HAPPENS HERE 
THE SECOND WEEK OF APRIL IN EVERY 
YEAR TIGER WOODS FINISHES RUNNER UP 
SNEDEKER IN THIRD POSITION ROUND 
IN SEVENTY SEVEN A TOUGH OLD BUT HE HAS 
BROUGHT A SMILE TO OUR FACES A 
REFRESHING WAY HE HAS PLAYED HE IS 
TIED WITH STEWART CINK IT IS A TRADITION THAT THE CADDIES 
GRAB THE FLAG ON THE LAST HOLE FOR 
THE WINNING PLAYER 
I THINK HE WILL 
CONTINUE THIS ALL OVER THE WORLD 
NOW BECAUSE HE HAS THREE OR FOUR 
PUTTS FOR IT NO HE HASN'T THIS LITTLE TIDDLER FOR A ROUND OF SEVENTY FIVE HE IS GOOD ENOUGH TO BE THE MASTERS CHAMPION FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
A DREAM COME TRUE VERY WARM 
APPLAUSE FROM THIS VERY 
COSMOPOLITAN CROWD THAT GATHERED 
HERE IN AUGUSTA THE NEW YOUNG 
CHAMPION THERE IS DAD 
MUM AND DAD 
AND AUNTIE NELLIE AND EVERYONE HIS HIS BROTHER MARK 
HE CHECKED THE CARD TAPPED IN THE 
LITTLE PUTT AND THAT WAS THAT THE 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT MASTERS CHAMPION FROM SOUTH 
AFRICA TREVOR IMMELMAN 
SIXTY EIGHT SIXTY EIGHT SIXTY NINE 
SEVENTY FIVE TODAY WELL PLAYED 
CONGRATULATIONS TO TREVOR 
WE HAVE HAD THINGS IN THE PAST IT 
IS NOT ALL OVER UNTIL IT IS SORTED 
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CHECKED AND 
DOUBLE CHECKED IT HAS BEEN VERY INTERESTING FOUR DAYS 
COMMISERATIONS THAT 
WAS A TOUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE HOW 
DO YOU RATIONALISE IT 
IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO RATIONALISE IT THE 
DISAPPOINTING THING IS THAT I FELT 
THE POOR SHOT WAS THE TEE SHOT ON 
THE FOURTH WHICH LEFT ME IN A REALLY 
DIFFICULT LIE IT PROBABLY 
COMPOUNDED THAT WITH A POOR BUNKER 
SHOT THAT REALLY WAS YOU KNOW 
THE TWO POOREST SHOTS I HAVE HIT 
ALL WEEK AND I WALKED AWAY WITH A 
DOUBLE THERE AND HAVING PAUL MOVED 
UPON ME ON THE 
SIXTH THAT TOOK THE 
WIND OUT OF MY SAILS IT WAS SO 
DIFFICULT OUT THERE TODAY 
EVERYBODY HAS MADE MISTAKES AS YOU 
HAVE SEEN BOGEYS YOU CAN HANDLE 
DOUBLES LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY'S 
MADE ONE BUT TO HAVE A GOLF BALL 
MOVE ON YOU JUST WHEN I THOUGHT 
MAKE A PAR RIGHT THE SHIP AND 
THAT BOGEY STREAK THAT IS OUT OF 
YOUR CONTROL AND THAT IS DIFFICULT 
TO HANDLE THAT KIND OF THREW ME 
FOR A COUPLE OF HOLES AND THAT WAS 
IT GOING INTO THE BACK NINE I WAS 
TOO FAR BACK SIMPLE AS THAT A 
TOUGH GOLF COURSE AT LEAST I BROKE 
EIGHTY 
A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE BUT WHAT EIGHTY DO YOU LEARN FROM IT AND HOW MUCH 
STRONGER DO THINK YOU WILL BE WHAT WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER 
I HAVE STILL HAD A GREAT WEEK IT 
IS VERY DISAPPOINTING TODAY AND I 
WILL GO AWAY AND THINK ABOUT THIS 
BUT I'VE GOT TO TAKE THE POSITIVES 
OUT OF IT AS I ALWAYS TRY TO DO 
THERE WAS SOME VERY GOOD GOLF THAT 
I PLAYED THIS WEEK EVEN COMING 
DOWN THE STRETCH I'M NOT SURE 
ANYBODY WOULD BE DID THAT CLOSE ON 
THE SEVENTEEN PAINT IN TWO STRAIGHT 
DOWNWIND AND DONE A BIRDIE THERE 
AND THAT MADE ME SMILE IT IS WHAT 
IT IS PIN IT LOOKS LIKE TREVOR 
IS GOING TO WIN THIS THING THAT IS 
GREAT FOR HIM AND IT WILL MAKE ME 
WORK HARDER BECAUSE HE IS ONE OF MY 
MATES 
A NEXT TIME MATES BUT IT IS TREVOR 
NORMAN'S DAY AND A GREAT DAY IT 
WAS AS WELL TREVOR IMMELMAN 
TIMES OF WORRY BUT HE OVERCAME THEM 
THAT WAS THE PUTT THAT SEALED HIS 
VICTORY A COMFORTABLE ONE IN THE 
END BY THREE 
HE HAS GOT THE THUMBS UP HE HAS 
SIGNED HIS SCORE CARD AND THE 
VICTOR 
A GREAT DAY IT IS TOUGH TO VICTOR WIN A MAJOR IT HAS BEEN THIRTY YEARS 
SINCE SOMEONE HAS WON IT WIRE TO 
WORK HE HAS A VERY LONG WEEK HIT 
IT IN THE WATER MORE PRESSURE 
NOTHING IS EVER THAT EASY 
IT IS 
NEVER OVER TILL IT IS OVER HE HE DROVE THE BALL BEAUTIFULLY ALL WEEK 
A THAT WAS HIS STRONG POINT 
HE HIT 
A LOT OF LONG STRAIGHT DRIVES HE 
PLAYED BEAUTIFULLY ALL WEEK HE HE CRUCIALLY HELD SOME VITAL PUTTS ON 
THE FINAL ROUND 
RIGHT FROM THE 
FIRST HOLE HE HIT A SIX FOOTER FOR 
THE BOGEY THE ONE ON NINE WAS 
MAGNIFICENT 
AND THIS ONE 
HE COULD MAGNIFICENT EASILY THREE PUTT THIS BUT HE BOWLS 
IT RIGHT INTO THE CENTRE OF THE CUP 
THE PERFECT PUTT FEELING GREAT 
WALKING ON TO THE TWELFTH TEE OVER 
THE BACK DUFFS THE FIRST LONG PUTT 
LEAVES THE NEXT ONE SHORT THIS WAS 
A GREAT SHOT LOTS OF 
PRESSURE THE 
THE THIRD SHOT TO THIRTEEN HE PLAYED A 
BEAUTY YESTERDAY AND HE MATCHED IT 
TODAY 
VIRTUALLY STONE DEAD FROM TODAY FROM THERE ON IN HE WAS OBVIOUSLY 
VERY STRONG FAVOURITE HE HAD THAT 
MOMENT OF MADNESS AT SIXTEEN AND THEN 
THIS WONDERFUL BUNKER SHOT SEALED 
IT 
IT IS A GREAT SHOT HE HAD TO IT HOLD IT TWO SHOTS IS NEVER ENOUGH 
WITH ONE HOLE TO GO 
NICE TO PLAY 
THE LAST KNOWING THAT SIX WOULD BE 
SIGNIFICANT BUT STILL AN ELEMENT 
OF RELIEF AFTER THIS TEE SHOT I I THINK IT IS UP THERE AND HE IS AN 
INCH UNDER THE GROUND ON A BIG 
DIVOT IT IS NOT OVER YET YOU YOU WOULD NOT HAVE LIKED THAT IF YOU 
NEEDED A FOUR NO 
HE PLAYED IT NO BEAUTIFULLY 
GREAT SHOT EVERY BEAUTIFULLY EVERY GOLFER DREAMS OF THIS SORT OF THING 
WALKING OFF EIGHTEEN A NICE COMFORTABLE 
LEAD 
THAT WAS IT WE KNEW THEN LEAD THAT HE HAD WON THE MASTERS HIS HIS HERO GARY PLAYER HAD BEEN 
WATCHING THIS FEELING PROUD BUT 
I'M SURE THERE YOU GO THE MASTERS CHAMPION MANY VITAL MOMENTS TODAY YOU GO 
PERHAPS GO BACK TO YESTERDAY FOR 
THE MOMENT 
HIS THIRD SHOT AT FIFTEEN 
HOW IT DOESN'T GO INTO THE WATER IS 
EXTRAORDINARY HE HAS NEVER SEEN 
THE BALL GO DOWN THAT HILL AS THE 
COMMENTATOR SAID L. CANNOT 
RECOMMEND REMEMBER ONE STOPPING

OWN

WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR HIM THAT IS 
THREE WOOD FIVE IRON FOR HIM THE 
SECOND SHOT ON FOURTEEN WAS PROBABLY THE 
WORST ALL DAY

THROUGH THE MILL THE WORST HAS 
HAPPENED NEXT TIME OR THEY MIGHT 
BE A BIT MORE RELAXED AND IN 
CONTROL AND JUST LET THINGS HAPPEN 
MAYBE THEY TRIED TOO HARD TO MAKE 
THINGS HAPPEN AND ON A DAY LIKE
