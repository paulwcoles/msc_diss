TERRORISM IS PART AND PARCEL OF 
ISLAM ISLAM TERRORISM IS PART OF THE THIS THIS MAN AND FIVE OTHERS ARE CONVICTED 
OF SUPPORTING TERRORISM WHY DID IT 
TAKE SO LONG 
NEWSNIGHT HAS BEEN REPORTING ON THE 
ACTIVITIES OF ABU IZZADEEN AND THE 
RADICAL AL MUHAJIROUN GROUP HE WAS 
PART OF FOR YEARS SO WHY WERE THE 
SECURITY SERVICES SO FAR BEHIND IS 
IT TOO LATE TO STOP THE 
RADICALISATION THAT THE MEN 
PERPETRATED TONIGHT NEW EVIDENCE 
OF EXTREMISM OF THE MEN PREPARED TO 
PUT BRITISH LIVES IN DANGER IN 
WASHINGTON SMILES FOR WHOEVER THE 
NEXT PRESIDENT MAY BE BUT THERE IS 
TROUBLE BREWING FOR GORDON BROWN AT 
HOME HOME ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION LEADER 
REVEALS HE WAS APPROACHED BY THE 
ZANU P. F. PARTY TO BROKER A POSSIBLE 
TRANSITION OF POWER 
AND HOW AND HOW THE MEDIA 
PORTRAYS THE MEDIA IMMIGRATION 
DEBATE SAME STORY DIFFERENT 
HEADLINES WILL WE EVER GET TO THE 
TRUTH 
GOOD EVENING 
ABU IZZADEEN DESCRIBED THE SEVEN 
SEVEN SEVENTHS ATTACK ON LONDONERS AS 
COMPLETELY PRAISE WORTHY ON THAT 
PROGRAMME TODAY HE HAS BEEN FOUND 
GUILTY OF INCITING TERRORISM 
OVERSEAS AND FOR RAISING MONEY TO 
FUND IT FIVE OTHERS WERE CONVICTED 
ALONGSIDE HIM INCLUDING SULAYMAN 
KEELER WHO HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF 
A NEWSNIGHT INVESTIGATION THE 
ORGANISATION THEY WERE A PART OF 
AL MUHAJIROUN WAS ALLOWED TO 
CONTINUE TO ORGANISE AND TO 
RECRUIT MEMBERS UNTIL AS LATE AT 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR N. A MOMENT WE ARE ASKING WHERE 
THE WHY THE SECURITY SERVICES 
FAILED TO CRACK DOWN ON THE GROUPS 
LONG KNOWN TO BE BEHIND THIS 
ACTIVITY ACTIVITY FIRST INVESTIGATING THE ACTIVITIES 
OF AL MUHAJIROUN 
SHAME ON ALL OF US WHO LISTEN TO 
HIM DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY MUSLIMS 
HAVE BEEN ARRESTED 
ABU IZZADEEN 
THE JAMAICAN CONVERT CONVICTED 
TODAY SHOT TO PROMINENCE IN 
SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN HE HECKLED 
THE FORMER HOME SECRETARY JOHN 
REID HE HAS BEEN URGING BRITISH 
MUSLIMS TO UNEARTH EXTREMISTS 
THIS INTERVENTION DID NOT BREAK THE 
LAW BUT SPEECHES LIKE THIS GIVEN 
AT REGENT'S PARK MOSQUE IN LONDON 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR DID 
TERRORISM IS PART AND PARCEL OF 
ISLAM ISLAM TERRORISM IS PART OF THE DEAN OF 
ISLAM YES 
EVEN SO THE POLICE 
APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SLOW TO ACT AN 
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR WHO TRACKS 
TERRORISTS AND EXTREMISTS WEBSITES 
SAID THAT HE DOWNLOADED THE 
REGENT'S PARK MOSQUE SPEECHES FROM 
A PASS WORD PROTECTED WEBSITE AND 
PASSED THEM ON TO THE POLICE IN 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHAT I FIND SURPRISING IS IF YOU 
GET ACROSS THE DETAIL AND HACK 
INTO THE WEBSITES DOWNLOAD THE 
VIDEOS SEND THEM OFF TO THE ANTI 
TERRORIST POLICE SURELY THE 
AUTHORITIES MUST BE DOING THIS NO NO THEY ARE NOT THE MEETING THAT I 
HAD WITH THE SENIOR OFFICERS AT NEW 
SCOTLAND YARD SAID THAT THERE ARE 
SO MANY RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST 
SUPPORTING WEBSITES THEY HAVE NOT 
THE OFFICERS TO MONITOR THE WEB 
SO WHO IS ABU IZZADEEN BORN INTO A 
JAMAICAN SLASH BRITISH FAMILY FROM EAST 
LONDON HIS REAL NAME IS TREVOR 
BROOKS RAISED AT A COLIN BUT 
CONVERTED TO ISLAM AT SEVENTEEN IN THE 
MID NINETEEN NINETIES WHETHER THE RADICAL 
PREACHERS WERE WELCOMED INTO 
BRITAIN HE JOINED AL MUHAJIROUN 
OMAR BAKRI MUHAMMED'S ISLAMIC GROUP 
AL MUHAJIROUN SUPPORTED THE VIOLENT 
OVERTHROW OF THE BRITISH STATE AND 
THE IMPOSITION OF SLAUGHTERIE LAW 
WAE FOLLOWED HIS PROGRESS FOR YEARS 
SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE THE NINE ELEVEN 
ATTACKS IN TWO THOUSAND ONE A MASKED ABU 
IZZADEEN TOLGD US HOW HE WANTED TO 
TARGET AMERICA 
I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA IS ONE OF 
THE PLACES WHERE WE SHOULD BE 
BOMBING THOSE THE GOVERNMENT 
THERE ARE SOME MUSLIMS THAT GO TO 
AMERICA OBVIOUSLY LIGHT FIREARMS 
IS AVAILABLE IN AMERICA TO BE 
TRAINED LEGALLY SO WHY NO GO THERE 
AND USE IT TO THEY ARE THE HEART 
OF THE ENEMY ATTACKING US 
WE CAUGHT UP WITH HIM AGAIN THE 
COMMENTS THEN CREATED A STORM OF 
PROTEST PROTEST SUICIDE IS A TERM COINED IN THE 
MEDIA THEY ARE COMPLETELY PRAISE 
WORTHY WORTHY ARE YOU WILLING TO DENOUNCE THE 
LONDON BOMBINGS NO NO I WOULD NEVER DENOUNCE MUSLIMS 
THIS WAS MURDER NO NO SOME SAY THAT HATE PREACHERS 
DESERVE THAT THEY GET 
WORDS HAVE BECOME THE FUEL FOR 
BOMB MAKERS IF NOT THE ACTUAL 
BOMBS IT IS A DIFFICULT LINE TO 
WALK BETWEEN FREE SPEECH AND HATE 
SPEECH BUT THERE IS A LINE HE HAS 
CROSSED IT HE HAS INCITED AND 
ENCOURAGED YOUNG MEN TO GO OUT AND 
KILL THEMSELVES AND OTHERS IN THE 
NAME OF GOD THAT IS WICKED YOU YOU ARE EITHER WITH US OR THE 
TERRORISTS TERRORISTS WHAT DID THE MUSLIMS SAY WE ARE 
WITH THE TERRORISTS 
I FILMED SIMON KEELER IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AT 
THIS AL MUHAJIROUN MEETING IN 
LONDON WHERE THE NINE ELEVEN ATTACKS WERE 
DESCRIBED AS MAINGNIF CENT 
WOULD YOU USE THE WORD MAINGNIF 
CENT 
I WOULD 
BUT THE FACT OF THE CENT MATTER IS THAT THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THREE THOUSAND SO 
CALLED INYENTS INNOCENTS WHAT 
ABOUT THE INNOCENTS IN AFGHANISTAN 
YOU ARE CRYING ABOUT THE FACT THAT 
AMERICA THE OPPRESSOR IS PUNCHED 
IN THE NOSE THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT 
HAPPENED HAPPENED TODAY HE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF 
INCLIMATE TO TERROR 
BRITISH AUTHORITIES IGNORED THE 
ACTIVITIES OF AL MUHAJIROUN FOR A 
DECADE FINALLY ACTION IS BEING 
TAKEN IN THOSE INVOLVED IN 
RADICALISATION AND EXTREMISM 
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY HAVE 
ALREADY HAD THE CHANCE TO 
RADICALISE THE EXTREMISTS THIS IS 
THE PROBLEM THAT THE M. I FIVE RAND THE 
SECURITY SERVICES UNDERSTAND THEY 
HAVE JUDGED THAT THE TERRORISM 
THREAT IS INCREASING 
THIS IS A SPEECH MADE BY ABU MARYAM 
HE JOKES ABOUT HIS WORK AS A 
SECURITY OFFICER SCREENING LUGGAGE 
HE WAS UNEARTHED BY TERRORISM INVESTIGATOR INVESTIGATOR GLENYS KINNOCK WHAT DO WE HAVE 
HERE 
I HAVE COME ACONTROA VIDEO I HERE WAS MONITORING AS PART OF MY 
RESEARCH THIS GUY USED TO WORK AT 
AS AN SECURITY OFFICER SCANNING 
THINGS THROUGH COMPUTERS 
LET'S SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY 
LET'S PLAY THIS HERE 
I USED TO WORK AT ONE SECURITY FIRM 
WE WOULD EXAMINE THE STUFF ON THE 
COMPUTER SCREENS THE GROWN ONE IS 
SAFE THE RED ONE MEANS IT IS AN 
ALERT SO YOU KNOW WHAT I DO I 
MAKE IT GROWN I LET IT GO THROUGH 
HE IS SORT OF IMPLYING THAT IF 
SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO SMUGGLE 
SOMETHING ON TO AN AIRCRAFT HE 
WOULD LET IT THROUGH YES YES THAT IS THAT HAS HUGE 
CONSEQUENCES OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE 
OUTSIDE OF THE U. K. ARE OBVIOUSLY 
GOING TO BE COMPLETELY CONCERNED 
IT IS FRIGHTENING I THINK ANYBODY 
WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT IT IT IS 
CLEARLY A SECURITY RISK IT IS A 
PROBLEM IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
EXTREMIST BELIEFS WHO ARE BOOSTING 
THAT THEY COULD ATTACK PASSENGERS 
WORKING IN JOBS WHERE THEY HAVE 
ACCESS TO PASSENGERS THAT IS 
HORRIBLE HORRIBLE TONIGHT FIVE OUT OF THE SIX MEN 
FOUND GUILTY OF TERRORISM OFFENCES 
ARE IN PRISON AWAITING SENTENCING 
THE SIXTH SHAH JILAL HUSSAIN IS 
ON THE RUN HAVING SKIPPED BAIL 
DURING THE TRIAL A TRIAL THAT 
DRAWS LINE UNDER AL MUHAJIROUN 
BUT NOT UNDER RADICALISATION AND 
TERROR TERROR WITH ME IS A FORMER HEAD OF THE 
DISBANDED GROUP AL MUHAJIROUN 
ANJEM CHOUDHARY 
ANJEM CHOUDHARY THANK YOU FOR 
COMING TO NEWS NIGHT WILL YOU 
CONDEMN WHAT THE MEN HAVE DONE NOT NOT AT ALL THE COMMENTS WHICH ARE 
BEING MADE IN THE IN NOVEMBER 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR MUST BE PUT INTO CONTEXT THIS 
WAS A TIME REMEMBER THAT THE 
BRITISH AND THE AMERICANS WERE 
CAUSING MASS DESTRUCTION OF THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE OF FALLUJAH THERE 
WERE OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MADE 
HOMELESS ESTIMATES OF ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE WERE KILLED WEX WEAPONS 
OF MASS DETRUX WERE USED 
COMMENTS MADE BEFORE ERRORISM IS 
PART OF ISLAM COMMENTS THAT THE 
BOMBINGS WERE PRAISE WORTHY WHAT 
CONTEXT DO YOU NEED FOR THAT THE THE CONTEXT IS THAT THE COMMENTS WERE 
MADE IF SOMEONE COMES IN YOUR HOME 
AND KILL PEOPLE INDISCRIMINENTLY 
YOU CANNOT TALK ABOUT THE PERSON 
DEFENDING HIS HOME IN ISOLATION SO SO YOU SEE NOTHING WRONG 
NO THE 
POLICE HAVE A D. V. D. THEY DID NOT GET 
IT FROM OMAR BAKRI MUHAMMED'S HOUSE 
HIS TEMS WERE RETURNED THE 
STATEMENTS MADE ARE ON THE D. V. D. 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANYONE 
BEING INCITED OR EVIDENCE OF MONEY 
BEING COLLECTED OR ANYONE INDEED 
GOING ABROAD THIS IS A POLITICAL 
MANOEUVRE BY THE GOVERNMENT TO 
SILENCE ANYONE 
DESPITE A CONVICTION IN THE 
BRITISH COURTS IN THE COUNTRY IN 
WHICH YOU LIVE YOU DON'T YOU YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A NON MUSLIM 
JUDGE A NON MUSLIM JURY PEOPLE 
WHIPPED UP INTO A FRENZY IF YOU 
PICKED TWELVE PEOPLE UP OFF THE STREETS 
AND TALK ABOUT MUJAHIDEEN AFTER YOU 
HAVE DEMONISED THEM THEY WILL FIND 
THEM GUILTY 
DID ABU MARYAM LOOK DEMONISED WE 
HEARD ABOUT A MAN IN THE REPORT WHO 
JOKED ABOUT WORKING IN SECURITY 
PRESSING GREEN BUTTON TO LETTING 
SOMETHING THROUGH RATHER THAN A RED 
BUTTON 
GLENYS KINNOCK WE DON'T BUTTON KNOW WHO HE IS HE COULD ABSPY HE 
COULD BE WHIPPING UP FRENZY 
NOBODY HAS HEARD OF HIM YOU HAVE A 
LITTLE CLIP BY SOMEONE CALLED ABU 
MARYAM HE IS NOT ABU MARYAM 
INCIDENTLY I KNOW WHO HE IS YOU 
CAN CONTACT HIM YOU CAN SPEAK TO 
HIM IT IS FAR AWAY FROM WHAT IS 
PORTRAYED HIM 
YOU KNOW HIM CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 
WHAT HE WAS DOING 
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT PRESSING A 
GREEN BUTTON TO ALLOW SOMETHING 
THROUGH WHATEVER IT MAY BE 
HE WAS MAKING A COMMENT IT WAS 
MADE IN GUEST THE REAL CIMS 
CRIMINALS AS YOU KNOW AND I KNOW 
ARE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT THERE 
IS NOT ONE MUSLIM IN THIS COUNTRY 
TO AGREE WITH YOUR ANALYSIS OF IRAQ 
AND AFGHANISTAN THEY WILL AGREE 
WITH PEOPLE LIKE ABU IZZADEEN 
HE POSTED A VIDEO ON THE WEBSITE 
YOU HELPED TO RUN IS EVERYTHING ON 
THE WEBSITE A JOKE 
YOU ARE TALKING 
ABOUT CLIPS OF TALKS TAKEN OUT OF 
CONTEXT THEN USED IN A COURT OF 
LAW THIS IS THE SUEPEERYOT AS I 
JUDGE I CAN TELL YOU THIS CASE 
WOULD NEVER HAVE MADE IT INTO A 
SHAH YEAR COURT YOU HAVE NO 
EVIDENCE THE FACT IS THAT PEOPLE 
ARE BEING PROSECUTED 
WHY WOULD WE NEED SHAH YEAR COURT 
IN BRITAIN 
THIS IS SOMETHING TAKEN 
OUT OF CONTEXT 
THEY ARE 
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WATCHING THIS ANJEM 
CHOUDHARY WHO SAY THAT YOU PREFER 
SHARIA LAW THAT YOU HAVE LITTLE 
LOVE FOR THIS COUNTRY YOU HAVE 
LITTLE RESPECT FOR THE SYSTEM WHY 
DO YOU WANT TO LIVE HERE PEOPLE PEOPLE WERE LIVING IN APARTHEID IN SOUTH 
AFRICA PEOPLE LIVING IN AMERICA 
WHERE THERE WERE PROBLEMS IN THE 
BLACK COMMUNITY L. LIVE IN AN 
APARTHEID BRITAIN 
I WANT TO CHANGE THE SOCIETY L. 
CAN'T PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE I 
BELIEVE WE CAN LIVE TOGETHER AS 
DECENT HUMAN BEINGS WHERE THE 
DIVINE LAW IS IMPLEMENTED WHERE 
THE BASIC NEEDS ARE PROVIDED 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
KEITH VAZ IS WITH ME I AM NOT SURE 
WHAT YOU MADE OF THAT BUT ISN'T 
THE TRUTH THAT THE SECURITY 
SERVICES WERE TOO SLOW OFF THE MARK 
TO CUT DOWN ON THE KIND OF 
INCITEMENT TO TERRORISM THAT WE 
HAVE ONLY JUST SEEN TODAY BEING 
CONVICTED 
THE COURT OF LAW HAS CONVICTED MADE A CONVICTION AFTER A TRIAL L. 
DISAGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT HE 
HAS SAID OBVIOUSLY HE HAS A RIGHT 
WITH FREE SPEECH IN THIS COUNTRY 
TO SAY THE THINGS HE HAS SAID BUT 
I DISAGREE TOTALLY THERE HAS BEEN 
A TRIAL ACCORDING TO THE RULE OF 
LAW IN THIS COUNTRY AND THESE MEN 
HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY L. MAKE NO 
COMMENT ON THE TIME IT HAS TAKEN 
BECAUSE THESE ARE COMPLICATED 
ISSUES 
BUT IT IS NOT JUST THE ISSUES TRIAL WE KNEW ABOUT THIS GROUP'S 
ACTIVITY FOR YEARS AND PRESUMABLY 
THE SECURITY SERVICES DID AS WELL 
DETAILS OF THESE EXTREMIST WEBSITES 
WERE PASSED TO ANTI TERROR POLICE 
PEOPLE WILL BE SCRATCHING THEIR 
HEADS SAYING WHY WASN'T IT TAKEN 
MORE SERIOUSLY MORE QUICKLY 
I AM 
SURE IT WAS WE HAVE LEGISLATION 
THAT WAS PASSED BY PARLIAMENT THE 
TERRORISM ACT AND WE HAVE THE 
SECURITY SERVICES 
WE COULD HAVE 
TIGHTENED THE LAWS ON TERRORISM WE WE ARE ALWAYS TIGHTENING LAWS ON 
TERRORISM THE LAWS ARE GOING TO 
GET TOUGHER WITH PROPOSALS THAT ARE 
ON THE TABLE BY THE GOVERNMENT 
IMPLEMENTING MANY OF THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SELECT 
COMMITTEE BUT IT MUST BE UP TO THE 
SECURITY SERVICES TO DO WHAT THEY 
HAVE TO DO IN A PARLIAMENTARY 
DEMOCRACY CONSCIOUS OF THE RULE OF 
LAW THESE ARE DRACONIAN POWERS L. 
THINK THEY DID THE RIGHT THING IN 
THE RIGHT TIME FRAME AND IT IS 
APPROPRIATE THAT IT SHOULD HAVE 
ENDED UP IN COURT WITH A CONVICTION 
I CAN HEAR YOUR LEGISLATIVE VOICE 
THEIR AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT 
IF YOU STEP BACK FROM IT THE HOME 
AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE A 
CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE WAS THAT EVERY 
PERSON THAT THEY LEFT THEN 
RECRUITED TEN MORE WHO THEN 
RECRUITED TEN MORE WHICH GREW 
EXPONENTIALLY AND WE ARE NOW 
TALKING ABOUT TWO THOUSAND VOICES 
WE DO 
NOT KNOW IF THEY DID LEAVE THEM 
THE SECURITY SERVICES ACT IN THEIR 
OWN WAY AND IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT 
TO DISCUSS IT ON NEWSNIGHT IT IS 
UP TO THEM TO GATHER THE EVIDENCE 
AND THE PROSECUTORS TO CONTINUE WE 
NEED TO ENGAGE WITH THE MUSLIM 
COMMUNITY I REPRESENT A SEAT IN 
LEICESTER WITH ABOUT TEN THOUSAND MEMBERS 
OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY 
HOW DO YOU 
ENGAGE WITH THOSE EXTREMIST VIEWS 
WE CANNOT BUT WE CAN ENGAGE WITH 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN THE 
LAWS OF THIS COUNTRY DO NOT 
BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE SHARIA LAW 
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WE HAVE LAWS 
WHICH THE VAST MAJORITY ABSOLUTELY 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF MUSLIM PEOPLE 
IN THIS COUNTRY SUPPORT BECAUSE 
THEY GO TO THE BALLOT BOX AND THEY 
ELECT GOVERNMENTS AND THEY OPPOSE 
THEM IN THE PROPER WAY THEY DO NOT 
GO ABOUT IT IN THE WAY THAT HAS 
BEEN SUGGESTED 
THANK YOU 
YOU CAN WATCH A RICHARD WATSON'S 
REPORTS ON HOW MUCH TO HER ROOM ON 
OUR WEBSITE 
ON AL MUHAJIROUN 
GORDON BROWN SPENT THIS AFTERNOON 
MEETING THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF 
AMERICA FOR THE FIRST TIME HE MET 
SENATOR BARACK OBAMA BEFORE 
SITTING DOWN WITH HILLARY CLINTON 
AND THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE JOHN 
MCCAIN HE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE 
MADE MUCH A SPLASH IN THE U. S. SO FAR 
HIS VISIT OVERSHADOWED BY THE POPE 
MEANWHILE BACK HOME THERE WERE 
RUMOURS OF AN IMMINENT RESIGNATION 
FROM WITHIN HIS GOVERNMENT PERHAPS 
LET'S CROSS TO MICHAEL CRICK FOR 
THE LATEST IN WASHINGTON 
GORDON BROWN WAS DIVERTED FROM AN 
IMPORTANT DAY OF MEETINGS IN 
WASHINGTON BY HAVING TO DEAL WITH 
TROUBLE BACK HOME IN PARTICULAR 
REPORTS THAT THE P. P. S. THE PRIVATE 
PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY AN UNPAID 
MINISTERIAL AIDE TO YVETTE COOPER 
WAS PLANNING TO RESIGN OVER THE 
ISSUE OF THE TEN PENCE TAX BAND MR. 
BROWN RANG HER AND PERSUADED HER 
NOT TO RESIGN ALTHOUGH MRS. SMITH 
DOES ADMIT THAT SHE DID HAVE 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUE SHE IS 
NORMALLY A VERY LOYAL LABOUR M. P. 
AND THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN A 
FORTNIGHT THAT MINISTERS HAVE 
MANAGED TO QUASH DISSENT ON THIS 
ISSUE THERE IS GOING TO BE A 
COMMONS DEBATE ON THE MATTER ON 
MONDAY WHICH COULD SEE A 
SUBSTANTIAL LABOUR REBELLION ALL 
THIS ON THE DAY THAT GORDON BROWN 
NOT ONLY MET THE PRESIDENT BUT 
ALSO THIRTY ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S THREE 
WANT TO BE PRESIDENT 
IT HAS BEEN A GLORIOUS HOT DAY IN 
WASHINGTON AND THERE WERE SIGNS IN 
THE ROSE GARDEN THAT THE BROWN BUSH 
RELATIONSHIP IS A BIT WARMER TOO 
WE HAD A FABULOUS CONVERSATION L. 
AM LOOKING FORWARD TO DINNER 
TONIGHT THE PRIME MINISTER IS 
BRINGING HIS WIFE SARAH UP TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE WE ARE GOING TO COOK 
YOU MEAL WE WILL EAT ONE WITH 
YOU THANKS FOR COMING 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH MR. PRESIDENT LET ME 
FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
WARM WELCOME YOUR HOSPITALITY AND 
FOR YOUR OFFER TO COOK THE MEAL 
THIS EVENING AND LET ME THANK YOU 
FIRST OF ALL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP 
THE WORLD OWES PRESIDENT GEORGE 
BUSH A HUGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE IT IT SEEMED A LOT LESS FROSTY THEM WHEN 
GORDON BROWN VISITED THE PRESIDENT 
AT CAMP DAVID LAST JULY WHEN THERE 
WAS GREATER DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM 
AND THE PRIME MINISTER SEEMED TO GO 
OUT OF HIS WAY TO SHOW HE WAS NOT 
TONY BLAIR 
IN A MISHAP OF TIMING THIS SON OF 
A PRESBYTERIAN MINISTER HAS BEEN 
UPSTAGED BY THE WORLD LEADER OF THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH THE FIRST VISIT BY 
A POPE TO WASHINGTON IN ALMOST THIRTY 
YEARS AND AS POPE BENEDICT T. 
SHIRTS COMPETED WITH PRESIDENTIAL 
CONTENDERS ON THE KERBSIDE NOT A 
GORDON BROWN COFFEE MUG OR BADGE 
AMONG THEM AS THE POPE CELEBRATED 
MASS THIS MORNING AT THE NATIONAL 
STADIUM GORDON BROWN WAS QUIETLY 
ENTERTAINING GUESTS ON THE OTHER 
SIDE OF TOWN AT THE HOME OF THE 
BRITISH AMBASSADOR AMAZINGLY 
GORDON BROWN'S AS IT DOES NOT 
APPEAR TO HAVE HAD A SINGLE MENTION 
IN THE NEWS SECTION OF THIS 
MORNING'S WASHINGTON POST AND YET 
NOT SINCE WINSTON CHURCHILL AS ANY 
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER BEEN SO 
NATURALLY PRO AMERICAN NOT EVEN 
MARGARET THATCHER OR TONY BLAIR MR. 
BROWN REGULARLY USED TO COME ON 
HOLIDAY TO AMERICA AND HE HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED BY AMERICAN 
CULTURE AND AMERICAN POLITICS 
HE WOULD HAVE WANTED TO KNOW MORE 
ABOUT THE COMING MAN BARACK OBAMA 
HE HAD NEVER MET BEFORE BUT TO 
AVOID CHARGES OF FAVOURITISM EACH 
CONTENDER GOT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME 
THAT IS BARACK OBAMA DEALT WITH 
HIS ALLOTTED FORTY FIVE MINUTES NEXT 
HILLARY CLINTON WHO SHOULD BE 
RATHER MORE FAMILIAR TO GORDON 
BROWN ARGUABLY LAYING THE 
GROUNDWORK FOR DEALING WITH WHOEVER 
IS AMERICA'S NEXT PRESIDENT IS MORE 
IMPORTANT TO GORDON BROWN THAN 
TALKING TO THE CURRENT ONE WHO HAS 
ONLY NINE MONTHS LEFT IN OFFICE 
FAR AND AWAY HIS MOST IMPORTANT 
MEETING TODAY WAS WITH THE THREE 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ONE OF 
THEM IS GOING TO BE HIS PARTNER FOR 
THE NEXT FEW YEARS ASSUMING HE 
REMAINS IN OFFICE AS WELL GEORGE 
BUSH IS THE LAMEST OF LAME DUCKS 
BARELY QUACKING ANY MORE IF HE IS 
NOBODY IS REALLY LISTENING SO IT 
REALLY IS GOING TO DEPEND ON WHAT 
KIND OF RELATIONSHIP GORDON BROWN 
BILLS WITH JOHN MCCAIN HILLARY 
CLINTON OR BARACK OBAMA BUILDS 
ON THE CONTRARY SAYS ONE BARACK 
OBAMA SUPPORTER THE MEETINGS 
MATTERED MORE FOR MR. BROWN 
I THINK 
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO GET TO 
KNOW THE NEXT PRESIDENT AT THIS 
MOMENT CANDIDATES ARE PREOCCUPIED 
WITH THEIR ELECTIONS AND IT IS NOT 
GOING TO MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE TO 
THEIR ELECTORAL OUTCOMES WHETHER OR 
NOT THEY HAVE A MEETING WITH THE 
PRIME MINISTER SYMBOLICALLY IT 
SHOWS THEY ARE INTERESTED IN 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS BUT 
NOT GIVE 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS BUT DOES NOT GIVE THEM MUCH OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
SHINE TO MAKE SOME SORT OF MAJOR 
IMPACT ON THE ELECTORAL PROCESS SO SO WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 
THE CANDIDATES BARACK OBAMA 
OPPOSED THE IRAQ WAR AND TALKS OF 
PULLING OUT BY THE END OF NEXT WAR 
HE ALSO WANTS AMERICA TO TALK WITH 
SYRIA AND IRAN HE WANTS A STRONGER 
NATO BUT HAS SENT MIXED MESSAGES ON 
FREE TRADE HILLARY CLINTON VOTED 
FOR THE WAR BUT CRITICISED ITS 
EXECUTION AND ALSO WANTS TO SPEED 
UP AMERICA'S WITHDRAWAL SHE IS 
STRONGLY PRO ISRAEL AND HAS MADE 
PROTECTIONIST NOISES ON TRADE THE 
REPUBLICAN CONTENDER JOHN MCCAIN 
IN CONTRAST VOTED FOR THE WAR AND 
IS WILLING TO COMMIT MORE TROOPS 
NOW IF NECESSARY HE WANTS STRONG 
ACTION AGAINST GENOCIDE IN DARFUR 
AND FIRMLY BACKS FREE TRADE I I THINK THAT JOHN MCCAIN WILL 
CONTINUE A LOT OF THE POLICIES OF 
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WITH ONE 
EXCEPTION HE WILL BE FAR MORE IN A 
LISTENING MODE WITH ALLIES HE WILL 
BE FAR MORE CO OPERATIVE IN DEALING 
WITH THE ALLIES THAN THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN HE HAS 
SIGNALLED THAT ALREADY THAT IS 
KIND OF HIS TEMPERAMENT HE SEES 
HIMSELF AS A LEADER OF THE ALLIANCE 
BUT WITH THE ALLIANCE THERE NOT A 
LEADER WITHOUT THE ALLIANCE SO I 
THINK JOHN MCCAIN WILL PAY A LOT OF 
ATTENTION ESPECIALLY TO THE BRITISH 
RELATIONSHIP 
AND IF BARACK OBAMA RELATIONSHIP WINS COULD HIS OPPOSITION TO THE 
WAR CAUSED PROBLEMS 
I DON'T THINK 
SO ESPECIALLY SINCE PRIME MINISTER 
BROWN WAS NOT ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL 
ADVOCATES OF THE WAR MOREOVER I 
THINK WE KNOW AND I ASSUME SENATOR 
OBAMA KNOWS THAT MOST PEOPLE IN 
BRITAIN ARE CRITICAL OF THE WAR 
JUST AS MOST AMERICANS ARE TODAY 
LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE ANGLO 
AMERICAN RELATIONSHIP IS A CRITICAL 
RELATIONSHIP FOR US IT IS A POINT 
OF REFERENCE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC 
AND IT IS A LONG ESTABLISHED 
RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS IMPORTANT IN 
A VARIETY OF WAYS GEOPOLITICAL 
FINANCIAL ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL 
AND I THINK JOHN MCCAIN BARACK 
OBAMA OR HILLARY CLINTON WOULD ALL 
GET ON WITH GORDON BROWN 
BUT I 
THINK ACTUALLY THE ERA THAT WE ARE 
GOING INTO AS A COUNTRY IS GOING TO 
BE REALLY INWARD LOOKING L. THINK 
THAT THE BIG FOCUS IN AMERICA 
AFTER GEORGE BUSH LEAVES BEYOND 
JUST SORT OF REPAIR IS GOING TO BE 
NATION BUILDING WE ARE GOING TO BE 
A COUNTRY FOCUSED ON NATION 
BUILDING AT HOME NOT IN IRAQ NOT 
IN AFGHANISTAN WE NEED TO DO 
NATION BUILDING AT HOME GORDON GORDON BROWN EMERGED SAYING ALL THREE 
CONTENDERS WERE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE 
COULD DO BUSINESS L. AM CONFIDENT 
HAVING TALKED TO ALL OF THEM THAT 
THE COMMON GROUND THAT EXISTS THAT 
HAS BEEN THE BASIS OF THE SPECIAL 
RELATIONSHIP OVER DECADES IS AS 
STRONG AND SECURE AS EVER 
AND THAT 
IN EACH OF THE CHALLENGERS SENATOR 
OBAMA SENATOR CLINTON AND SENATOR 
MCCAIN WISH TO RISE TO THESE 
CHALLENGES THROUGH CEMENTING AND 
EXTENDING THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES 
AS THE 
AMERICAN PRESS WENT CRAZY OVER THE 
POPE TODAY GORDON BROWN'S FACE WAS 
SAVED A BIT BY FLICKER AND 
TWITTER TWO WEBSITES WHICH YOUNG 
INTERNET TYPES USED TO UPDATE EACH 
OTHER ON WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND 
NOW USED BY DOWNING STREET TO TELL 
US SOMEWHAT BREATHLESSLY ABOUT 
THE PRIME MINISTER'S EVERY MOVE 
BUT EVEN IN THE ROSE GARDEN THIS 
AFTERNOON GORDON BROWN COULD NOT 
AVOID QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS DOMESTIC 
WOES TOMORROW HE GOES NORTH TO 
MASSACHUSETTS THERE HE WILL TRY 
TO BRING THE AGENDA BACK TO WHAT HE 
SEES AS IMPORTANT LONG TERM MATTERS 
WITH WHAT IS BEING TRAILED AS A BIG 
SPEECH ON FOREIGN POLICY 
RANDY SCHEUNEMANN AND HIS FOREIGN 
POLICY ADVISER TO SENATOR MCCAIN 
AND WAS IN TONIGHT'S MEETING WITH 
GORDON BROWN AND IS NOW IN OUR 
WASHINGTON STUDIO WHICHEVER WAY 
YOU LOOK AT IT I GUESS GORDON 
BROWN'S NATURAL BEDFELLOW IS NOT 
GOING TO BE JOHN MCCAIN 
I AM NOT 
SURE WHY YOU WOULD SAY THAT EMILY 
I THINK VERY MUCH A NATURAL 
BEDFELLOW CAN BE HAD EVEN THOUGH 
SENATOR MCCAIN AND PRIME MINISTER 
BROWN COME FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF 
THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM SO DID 
PRIME MINISTER BLAIR AND PRESIDENT 
BUSH AND CHANCELLOR KOHL AND 
PRESIDENT CLINTON L. THINK THERE IS 
A GREAT COMMONALITY OF INTEREST AND 
THEY HAD AN EXCELLENT DISCUSSION 
ABOUT MANY INTERESTS OF MUTUAL 
CONCERN TODAY 
HE MAY BE LOOKING AT 
JOHN MCCAIN'S FOREIGN POLICY AND 
THINKING NONE OF IT LOOKS VERY 
DIFFERENT TO PRESIDENT BUSH IS HE 
RIGHT 
NO IN FACT I DON'T THINK HE RIGHT IS LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY 
CERTAINLY SOMEONE WHO SAYS THAT 
JOHN MCCAIN'S FOREIGN POLICY WOULD 
BE A CONTINUATION OF PRESIDENT BUSH 
HAS NOT LOOKED CLOSELY AT HIS 
FOREIGN POLICY HE HAS BEEN 
OUTSPOKEN ON CLIMATE CHANGE DETAIN 
NEED TREATMENT THE NEED TO CLOSE 
GUANTANAMO AND THE NEED FOR CLOSER 
CONSULTATION WITH ALLIES SIMILAR SIMILAR ADVISERS THOUGH WE ARE SEEING THE 
SAME NAMES FOLLOWING THROUGH TO 
MCCAIN 
THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE MCCAIN AND THAT IS THAT GEORGE BUSH IS NOT 
GOING TO BE ON THE BALLOT JOHN 
MCCAIN IS HE HAS HAD THREE DECADES 
OF EXPERIENCE IN FOREIGN POLICY AND 
NATIONAL SECURITY THAT HE WILL 
BRING TO THE OVAL OFFICE ON DAY ONE 
JOHN MCCAIN IS HIS OWN MAN WHEN IT 
COMES TO FOREIGN POLICY AND 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISERS ARE 
THERE TO PROVIDE ADVICE BUT AT THE 
END OF THE DAY HE MAKES HIS 
DECISION BASED ON HIS LIFETIME OF 
EXPERIENCE IN FOREIGN POLICY AND 
NATIONAL SECURITY 
THERE MUST BE 
UNEASE IN YOUR CAMP THOUGH WHEN 
YOU HEAR GORDON BROWN'S THOUGHTS 
ABOUT IRAQ PHASED TROOP 
WITHDRAWAL A RELUCTANCE TO PUT 
TROOPS ON THE STREETS OF BASRA 
ETCETERA THIS IS NOT THE LINE YOU 
WILL HEAR FROM THE CANE 
THE LINE 
YOU WILL HEAR FROM SENATOR MCCAIN 
AND I THINK IT IS SHARED BY PRIME 
MINISTER BROWN IS THE NEED TO 
FINISH THE JOB AND BUILD ON THE 
SUCCESSES OF PARTICULARLY THE PAST 
YEAR WITH THE NEW STRATEGY L. 
THINK WE ARE VERY MUCH IN TUNE L. 
UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME POLITICAL 
DIFFICULTIES IN THE U. S. AND IN THE 
U. K. BUT IT IS CERTAINLY NOT A 
SUBJECT OF DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE 
TWO IT WAS NOT TODAY AND HAS NOT 
BEEN IN PREVIOUS MEETINGS 
MORE THAN THREE WEEKS ON AND STILL 
NO SIGN OF A RESOLUTION TO THE 
ZIMBABWE CRISIS 
IN A MOMENT THE M. D. C. READER LEADER 
WILL TELL US WHY HE DOESN'T TRUST 
THE ZIMBABWE ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
TO RELEASE ACCURATE RESULTS 
TONIGHT NINETEEN DAYS AFTER THE ZIMBABWE 
ELECTION OPPOSITION LEADER 
TSVANGIRAI REVEALED 
HOW THE CRISIS 
TSVANGIRAI REVEALED HOW THE CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE WAS ALMOST AVERTED HE 
WAS APPROACHED AFTER THE ELECTION 
BY MUGABE'S ZANU P. F. PARTY TO 
DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF TRANSITION GOVERNMENT 
THE GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY 
AND ACOME KAITION ACCOMMODATION 
SECURITY CONCERNS THOSE KIND OF 
THINGS WHICH WE WERE READILY 
PREPARED TO DISCUSS WERE YOU 
PREPARED TO GIVE THEM GUARANTEES 
THEY WOULDN'T BE PROSECUTED 
ABSOLUTELY 
INCLUDE PLG MUGABE ABSOLUTELY INCLUDING MR. MUGABE 
THE HARDLINERS 
PERSUADED MUGABE TO FIGHT ON THE 
PRESIDENTAL RESULTS HAVE STILL NOT 
BEEN RELEASED ATTITUDES ARE 
HARDENING ON BOTH SIDES THE MUG 
MUGABE GOVERNMENT ACCUSED THE M. D. C. 
OF TRESSON SAYING THAT MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI WAS PLOTTING ILLEGAL 
REGIME CHANGE WITH BRITAIN 
TSVANGIRAI SAID THAT MUGABE MIGHT 
NOW HAVE TO FACE JUSTICE BRAVE 
TALK BUT FOR NOW HIGGS OPTIONS ARE 
LIMITED HE IS FACING AN ARMY THIRTY 
FORTY THOUSAND STRONG WELL ARMED 
RELATIVELY WELL QUIPPED LOTS OF 
RIOT GEAR 
AND ALSO AN ARMY WHICH IS WELL 
STUCK IN RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
WITH ITS ANTI OPPOSITION UNITS AND 
BY ALL ACCOUNTS NOW WITH A VERY 
CLEAR MILITARY PLAN TO LOCK DOWN 
THE OPPOSITION AHEAD OF WHAT EVER 
THEY ARE PLANNING NEXT WHICH COULD 
EITHER BE A SECOND ROUND RUN OFF 
FOR THE ELECTION OR INDEED AS SOME 
BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE IS 
ABOUT TO DECLARE HIMSELF THE WINNER 
OF THE FIRST ROUND OF THE ELECTION 
THE CAMPAIGN HAS ALREADY BEGUN 
THE U. S. AMBASSADOR TO ZIMBABWE SAID 
TODAY THAT OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS IN 
THE RURAL AREAS HAD BEEN MURDERED 
ABDUCTED AND FORCED FROM THEIR 
HOMES IN A SPATE OF VIOLENCE SINCE 
THE ELECTIONS 
WHAT THE AMERICAN 
AMBASSADOR IS REFLECTED IN THE 
SITUATION HAPPENING ON THE GROUND 
NOW WHERE PEOPLE IN THE RURAL AREAS 
ARE BEING HARASSED BEING BEATEN 
IT'S SOME EFFORT OF WHAT HAS BECOME 
MILITARISED STATE WHICH IS ACTUALLY 
BEEN CONDITIONED FOR A VIOLENT RUN 
OFF WHEN IT IS HELD 
WHAT ARE 
MUGABE'S TACTICS TO CRUSH THE 
OPPOSITION 
MUGABE IS GOING FOR ONE OPPOSITION STRAIGHT OPTION TURN THE COUNTRY 
INTO A WAR ZONE WANE CONTESTED RUN 
OFF AND TRY TO WIN THIS ELECTION 
THROUGH UNORTHODOX MEANS THE RUN 
OFF 
THE CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE HAS OFF SPREAD TO SOUTH AFRICA WHICH COULD 
PLAY A CRUCIAL FLOL ANY SOLUTION 
WHERE EXILED ZIMBABWEANS HAVE BEEN 
CALLING FOR SOUTH AFRICA TO 
INTERVENE 
PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE INTERVENE AN INCREASE IN PRESSURE THEY WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE DENOUNCATION OF THE 
HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION AND ABUSES 
THAT HAVE HAPPENED EVEN SHORTLY 
BEFORE THE OBSERVER TEAMS WENT INTO 
THE COUNTRY 
ZIMBABWE IS RAPIDLY 
BECOMING A CRISIS FOR SOUTH 
AFRICA'S PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI HE 
IS IN CHARGE OF MEDIATION IN 
ZIMBABWE FOR THE REGIONAL GROUP 
SADC BUT HAS TAKE AN SOFTLY SOFTLY 
LINE WITH MUGABE AND WAS QUOTED AS 
SAYING THERE IS NO CRISIS IN 
ZIMBABWE HIS RIVAL JACOB ZUMA HAS 
TAKE AN VERY DIFFERENT LINE 
TALKING OF A DEEPENING CRISIS IN 
ZIMBABWE ZIMBABWE SO POLICY TOWARDS MUGABE HAS BECOME 
A BATTLEGROUND BETWEEN SOUTH 
AFRICA'S TWO LEADERS 
IT IS 
WEIGHTED AGAINST MBEKI AS THE 
OUTGOING LAME DUCK PRESIDENT ON 
ZIMBABWE ZIMBABWE IT HAS BEEN LONG BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF 
THE OPPOSITION IN ZIMBABWE 
IF A 
TOUGHER LINE TOWARDS MUGABE IS 
EMERGING IN SOUTH AFRICA THAT IS 
REFLECTED ACROSS THE SADC COUNTRIES 
OF SOUTHERN AFRICA THEY WERE 
FIRMLY BEHIND MUGABE BUT THAT IS 
NOW CHANGING 
THERE IS DIVISION WITHIN SADC ABOUT 
HOW TO APPROACH THE ZIMBABWE ISSUE 
WHICH OVER THE PAST YEAR IS MUGABE 
FROM NORTHERN IRELAND PRESSURE 
THIS IS WHAT MBEKI IS BEST SERVED 
TO DO WAS TO DEFEND MUGABE THE 
MOST IMPORTANT THING FROM WITHIN 
THE REGION AND BY THE RULING PARTY 
OF SOUTH AFRICA 
TOMORROW IS ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENCE 
DAY DAY IT IS TWENTY EIGHT YEARS SINCE THE OPTIMISTIC 
CELEBRATION THAT IS GREETED THE 
BIRTH OF THE NEW NATION AS ROBERT 
MUGABE CAME TO POWER TOMORROW 
MUGABE WILL BE MAKING HIS 
INDEPENDENCE DAY SPEECH ALL THOSE 
STILL WAITING FOR THE ELECTION 
RESULTS WILL BE WONDERING WHAT ON 
EARTH WENT WRONG MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
HASN'T BEEN BACK TO ZIMBABWE SINCE 
LAST WEEK'S MEETING WITH AFRICAN 
LEADERS IN ZAMBIA L. SPOKE WITH HIM THERE THERE I HAVE REQUESTED THE CHAIRMAN OF 
SADC TO REVIEW THE POSITION OF THE 
MEDIATOR PRESIDENT MBEKI THAT WE 
FACE AN EXTRAORDINARY TEST IN 
ZIMBABWE TODAY AND THAT HE ALONE 
CANNOT SOLVE THAT PROBLEM BUT I 
THINK WITH A NEW INITIATIVE LED BY 
WITH EX PRESIDENTS TO STAY IN 
ZIMBABWE LIKE THEY HAVE DONE IN 
KENYA TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM I THINK 
WE WOULD MAKE PROGRESS 
HE CALLED 
FOR THOSE ELECTION RESULTS TO BE 
RELEASED IS THIS A CHANGE OF 
DIRECTION FOR HIM 
I SUPPOSE THAT 
THE ELECTION RESULTS WOULD BE 
RELEASESIDE NOT ONLY UNLAWFUL IT 
IS ALSO MORALLY OUT OF TIME 
ZIMBABWE ELECTORAL COMMISSION HAS 
LOST THAT AUTHORITY TO COME OUT 
WITH THE CREDIBLE RESULTS BECAUSE 
OF THE INTERFERANCE FROM ZANU P. F. IN 
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RESULTS 
GIVEN THE EVENTS OF THE LAST TWENTY FOUR 
HOURS DO YOU HEAR A CHANGE IN TONE 
FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
NOW DO YOU HEAR THEM RALLYING 
BEHIND THE M. D. C. 
I THINK THERE IS 
ONE RALLYING POINT THAT THE PEOPLE 
OF ZIMBABWE HAVE SPOKEN THE WILL 
OF THE PEOPLE MUST BE RESPECTED 
THAT THE M. D. C. ACTUALLY WON THAT 
ELECTION MUGABE IS TRYING TO STEAL 
THE ELECTION IN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT 
THING IS WHAT IS RESINATING 
INTERNATIONALLY 
WHAT DO YOU INTERNATIONALLY ACTUALLY THINK CAME OUT OF ZAMBIA 
WAS IT USEFUL 
IT WAS USEFUL THERE 
WAS A CONCLUSION THE VERIFICATION 
OF THE PRESIDENTAL RESULTS HAD TO 
BE AUTHENTICATED BY ALL PARTIES 
INCLUDING SADC AND THE OPPOSITION 
THAT THEY HAVE TO BE SIGNED OFF 
WHAT SADC HAS BEEN DOING IS GO TO A 
PRIVATE LOCATION WHERE OUR MEMBERS 
ARE CERTAINLY WE WILL NOT ATHENT 
INDICATE THOSE RESULTS AS FAR AS 
THE SUMMIT WAS CONCERNED I THINK IT 
IS A GOOD CONCLUSION 
NO A RECOUNT 
NO TO A RUN OFF 
I'M SAYING NO TO 
BOTH BECAUSE FIRSTLY ON THE RUN OFF 
THERE IS NO BASIS FOR IT WE WON 
THE ELECTION WE WON IT 
DECRIESIVELY SECONDLY THERE IS NO 
NEED TO ENGAGE IN SHENANIGANS OF 
RECOUNTING WHEN THE DUE TIME HAS 
EXPIRED 
WHAT HAPPENS NOW YOU EXPIRED WON'T ALLOW A RECOUNT YOU WON'T 
ALLOW A RUN OFF ARE YOU AT A 
STALEMATE 
THE STALEMATE IS NOT STALEMATE CALLSED CAUSED BY M. D. C. IT IS 
CAUSED BY AN I WILL LEE GITIATE 
LEADER WHO IS REFUSING TO ACCEPT 
THAT HE LOST AN ELECTION AND THE 
PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN IT IS NOT 
COMING FROM THE OPPOSITION IT'S 
COMING FROM ZANU P. F. MORGAN MORGAN TSVANGIRAI THANK YOU 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME THIS 
EVENING HOW CAN A REPORT THAT 
BLAMES IMMIGRANTS FOR RISING CRIME 
ALSO BE A REPORT THAT SAYS 
IMMIGRANTS AREN'T CAUSING RISING 
CRIME WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT 
FIRST A ROUNDUP OF TODAY'S NEWS 
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT A RADICAL 
MUSLIM PREACHER WHO DESCRIBED THE 
SEVEN SEVENTHS ATTACK AS TOTALLY 
PRAISEWORTHY ON NEWSNIGHT HAS BEEN 
CONVICTED OF TERRORIST FUNDRAISING 
AN INCITING TERRORISM OVERSEAS 
IZZADEEN ABU IZZADEEN WAS 
CONVICTED OF SUPPORTING TERRORISM 
A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD YOUTH ACCUSED OF 
MURDERING RHYS JONES APPEARED IN 
COURT THE BOY WHO CAN'T BE NAMED 
BECAUSE OF HIS AGE WAS REMANDED IN 
CUSTODY RHYS WAS SHOT IN LIVERPOOL 
LAST AUGUST WHILE ON HIS WAY HOME 
FROM FOOTBALL PRACTICE THE INDIAN 
LEG OF THE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY HAS 
BEEN HELD AMID INTENSE SECURITY 
INTENDED TO WARD OFF ANY POSSIBLE 
PRO TIBET PROTESTERS SIXTEEN THOUSAND 
SECURITY PERSONNEL SEALED OFF THE 
HEART OF DELHI EXCLUEDING ALL 
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO AVOID 
CAMPAIGNERS GETTING NEAR THE TORCH 
THE MARKETS TODAY 
WHEN CAN TWO PAPERS READ THE SAME 
REPORT AND COME OUT WITH OPPOSITE 
HEADLINES ANSWER WHEN THE SUBJECT 
IS IMMIGRATION REPORTING ON 
FINDING FROM THE CHIEFS OF POLICE 
THE MAIL DECLARED THAT IMMIGRATION 
HAS BROUGHT HUGE SURGE IN 
ORGANISED CRIME THE GUARDIAN AND 
SOME B. B. C. BULLETINS REPORTED THE 
SAME MATERIAL HAS SHOWING THAT 
MIGRANT CRIME WAVE IS A MYTH ALL 
THIS COMES AS A B. B. C. SURVEY FOUND A 
CLEAR MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THOUGHT 
THE OVERALL LEVEL OF IMMIGRATION 
HAS BEEN TOO HIGH WE ASK HOW WE 
ENTER PREPT PRET THE FIGURES WHEN 
THE SUBJECT ITSELF REMAINS DEVICIVE 
AND SO EMOTIVE THE IMPACT OF MASS 
IMMIGRATION IT HAS BEEN A STABLE 
OF THE TABLOIDS SINCE LONG BEFORE 
AN ESTIMATED ONE MILLION EASTERN 
EUROPEANS BEGAN TO MOVE TO THE U. K. 
THE CHARGE THAT MIGRANTS HAVE 
BROUGHT CRIME AND CHAOS THE 
LIBERAL MEDIA HAS COUNTED THEY 
CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMY AND 
ENRICH BRITISH CULTURE SO WHO IS 
RIGHT YESTERDAY THE GUARDIAN LED 
WITH A STORY THAT A REPORT FROM THE 
ASSOCIATION OF CHIEF POLICE 
OFFICERS HAD CONCLUDED THAT THE PAPER SAID IT SAID 
YESTERDAY THE TODAY PROGRAMME WHRED 
SIMILAR CLAIMS FRPLTS IT IS EIGHT HUNDRED A M. 
THE HEADLINES POLICE SAY THE 
INFLUX OF MIGRANT WORK TORS BRITAIN 
HAS NOT INCREASED OVERALL CRIME 
TODAY THE DAILY MAIL ALONG WITH THE 
DAILY EXPRESS COUNTERED AGAINST 
THIS APPARENT SCOPE THE MAIL 
CLAIMED WHEN YOU READ THE REPORT 
IT THE MAIL SAYS IN FACT CORRECTLY IT QUOTES THE REPORT AS SAYING 
CITING EXTORTION PICKPOCKETING AND 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHAT IS THE 
TRUTH OF THE MATTER L. HAVE BEEN 
THROUGH THE POLICE REPORT I'VE 
COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION AS THE 
DAILY MAIL THERE IS NO CLAIM IN IT 
THAT THE INCREASE TO IMMIGRATION TO 
BRITAIN HAS HAPPENED WITHOUT A RISE 
IN CRIME IT SAYS ONLY A MINORITY 
OF MIGRANTS HAVE HAD CONTACT WITH 
THE POLICE IT DOES SAY THERE HAVE 
BEEN SOME PROBLEMS IN SPECIFIC 
CRIM AREAS THAT POLICE RESOURCES 
HAVE BEEN STRETCHED 
HOW COME THE GUARDIAN LIKE THE B. B. C. 
GOT SUCH A DIFFERENT IMPRESSION OF 
THE REPORT 
WELL WE TALKED TO 
PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN 
PREPARING THE REPORT LIKE OTHER 
NEWS ORGANISATIONS WE WON'T GO INTO 
WHETHER WE HAD SEEN ALL THE REPORT 
BITS OF REPORT OR TALKED TO SOURCES 
WHO HAD BEEN CLOSELY INVOLVED IN 
THE REPORT BUT SEVERAL MEDIA 
ORGANISATIONS REPORTED THE SAME 
SHAPE OF STORY EVEN MEDIA 
ORGANISATIONS WHO HAVE BEEN HOW DO 
WE SAY MORE ACUTELY CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE ALLEGED LINK BETWEEN 
RECENT IMMIGRATION FROM EASTERN 
EUROPE AND AN ALLEGATIONS OF HIGHER 
LEVEL THAN AVERAGE OF CRIMINALITY 
THE DAILY MAIL WAS UNABLE TO 
PROVIDE ANYONE TO INTERVIEW AT 
SHORT NOTICE 
THEIR ANALYSIS IN TODAY'S PAPER IS 
THAT THE GUARDIAN AS PART OF THE 
CULLIBLE LIBERAL MEDIA WERE GIVEN 
A BRIEFING ON THE REPORT BUT SPUNG 
A LINE THEY RECKON ONE OF THE CO 
AUTHORS WANTED A GOOD NEWS STORY 
AHEAD OF TODAY'S MIGRANT CRIME 
SUMMIT WITH THE HOME SECRETARY 
I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO SOURCING IT 
WASN'T YOU KNOW JACQUI SMITH'S 
PEOPLE IT WASN'T PEOPLE IN 
WHITEHALL WHITEHALL IT JUST YOU KNOW THE DAILY MAIL 
CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT THEY ARE 
SORE BECAUSE THEM AND OTHERS HAVE 
BEEN BANGING ON ABOUT THIS EVEN 
THE POLICE EVEN THE POLICE YOU 
KNOW SAY WELL THERE IS THE SAME 
AMOUNT OF CRIMINALITY IN THE GROUPS 
THERE IS NOTHING ESPECIALLY HIGH 
THE PERSON WHO WE UNDERSTAND TO BE 
THE SOURCE IN ALL THIS WAS 
UNAVAILABLE FOR INTERVIEW TONIGHT 
GIVEN HE IS SEEN YORP FIGURE YOU 
CAN'T BLAME THE GUARDIAN AND THE 
B. B. C. FOR TAKING HIM SERIOUSLY WE 
KNOW IMMIGRATION IS POLITICAL 
FOOTBALL THIS TIME IT SEEMS TO HAVE 
BEEN KICKED AROUND WITH MORE SPIN 
THAN ANYONE COULD REASONABLY 
SUSPECT EXPECT JOINING ME NOW TWO 
MEN ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE 
IMMIGRATION DEBETH SIR ANDREW GREEN 
AND DANNY SRISKANDARAJAH FROM THE 
INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH 
HOW DO WE HAVE THIS MUCH SOUGHT 
AFTER GROWN UP DEBATE ON I WILL 
GRAITION WHEN THIS IS THE RADICALLY 
DIFFERENT TAKE TWO OF MAIN STREAM 
NEWSPAPERS NEWSPAPERS IT IS A GOOD QUESTION L. MEAN WHAT 
IT SHOWS I THINK THERE IS 
TREMENDOUS PARTISANSHIP THE GUARD 
GURD WILL SEIZE ON A STORY 
FAVOURABLE TOWARDS IMMIGRANTS OTHER 
NEWSPAPERS WILL SEIZE ON STORIES 
THAT ARE NOT YOUR CORRESPONDENT IS 
EXACTLY RIGHT L. L. HAVE THE FLORP MY 
HAND NONE OF THE QUOTES IN THE 
GUARDIAN ARE IN THE REPORT 
SO THEY CLEARLY IT HAD BEEN LEAKED 
TO THEM WITH SPIN BY A POLICEMAN 
WHICH IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT IS NOT WE 
PAY OUR COPPERS TO DO THEY 
SWALLOWED IT AND PUT IT ON THE 
FRONT PAGE 
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH I 
SAW YOU NODDING WHEN SHE CAME DOWN 
ON THE SIDE OF THE MAIL ISN'T THE 
TRUTH ANDREW GREEN IT IS HARD IN 
THIS ONE TO SEPARATE FACTS AND 
IDEOLOGY YOU ARE BOUND TO WANT TO 
SIDE WITH THAT PERCEPTION 
I WRITE 
FOR THE MAIL I WRITE FOR THE 
TELEGRAPH AND THE SUNDAY TIMES 
DANNY WRITES FOR THE GUARDIAN LET 
ME CLEAR THAT INTEREST L. NODDED 
BECAUSE SHE WAS RIGHT THE REPORT 
IS HERE THOSE STATEMENTS ARE NOT 
IN IT PERIOD THE GUARDIAN HAS A 
HIGH STANDARD OF JOURNALISM ON THIS 
ONE THEY FAVOURED 
GULLIBLE LIBERAL 
MEDIA WAS THE PHRASE WE HEARD WITH 
ITS MOUTH WIDE OPEN 
I DON'T THINK 
SO AT ALL THERE ARE TWO FACTS 
THERE HAS BEEN NO GENERAL RISE IN 
CRIMINALITY AS A RESULT OF 
IMMIGRATION ON THE OTHER HAND 
THERE HAS BEEN A RISE IN SOME TYPES 
OF CRIME AT BOTH ENDS OF THE 
SPECTRUM 
WOULD THE PUBLIC MAKE SPECTRUM THAT DIFFERENCE WOULD THE PUBLIC 
SEE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT 
HAIR SPLITTING YOU ARE TALKING 
ABOUT 
NO PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE ABOUT PARTISAN AND NATURE THINGS ARE 
COVERED ON IMMIGRATION ONE OF THE 
INTERESTING FACTORS THAT POLLING 
SUGGESTS IS THAT THOSE PEOPLE 
LIKELY TO BE HOSTILE TO MIGRATION 
READ A CLUTCH OF PAPERS THOSE 
FAVOURABLY DISPOSED READ THE 
INDEPENDENT AND THE GUARDAN WE 
DON'T KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T 
LIKE IMMIGRANTS LIKE TO READ SIR 
ANDREW'S COLUMN IN THE MAIL WHO IS 
REINFORCING 
IF THAT LEAK HAD COME 
TO THE MAIL WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE 
DONE WITH THE STORY IT WAS FRONT 
PAGE YES 
ON BOTH PAPERS THEY PAGE YES THEY FELL OVER THEY WERE DIFFERENT DAYS 
THE GUARDIAN HAD NOT SEEN THE 
REPORT THEY FELL OVER YOU WOULD 
NORMALLY IF YOU WERE GOING TO PUT 
IT ON THE FRONT PAGE HAVE CHECKED 
AGAINST THE TEXT DANNY IS MAKING A 
DIFFERENT POINT THERE THE REPORT 
ITSELF WAS BALANCED WHAT IT SHOWED 
BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE THERE 
IS MORE CRIME OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE 
MORE PEOPLE WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE IS 
MORE POLICE YOU DON'T HAVE MORE 
MONEY ALL THESE CASES ARE MORE 
DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH BECAUSE OF 
THE LANGUAGE PROBLEM AND VARIOUS 
ASSOCIATED PROBLEMS WHAT WE ARE 
SEEING IN THE POLICE THEY ARE IN 
THE FRONT LINE OF THIS WE ARE 
SEEING WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN 
HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS AND SO ON 
THAT THE HUGE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS 
NOW ARRIVING IS PUTTING PUB 
PUBLIC SERVICES UNDER STRAIN YOU YOU WORK IN MIGRATION WATCH WITH A 
CERTAIN LEVEL OF STATISTICS WHICH 
ACTUALLY WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF OF 
YES WE DO 
WE DON'T KNOW THE 
FIGURES OF THE PEOPLE COMING IN 
BROADLY WE KNOW 
YOU WILL USE 
I USE GOVERNMENT STATISTCK ALWAYS 
THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T KNOW HOW 
MANY PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THEY THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT EASTERN EUROPEANS 
THEIR NUMBERS WITH FEEBLE YOU CAN 
DRAW BROAD CONCLUSIONS 
THESE LAST 
TWO DAYS ARE NORMAL PRACTICE IN 
TERMS OF THE WAY IMMIGRATION IS 
COVERED WHAT WAS UNUSUAL IS THE 
GUARDIAN IS THE SUBJECT OF 
CRITICISM JUST LAST WEEK THE 
EQUALITIES IN HUMAN RIGHTS 
COMMISSION PUBLISHED A REPORT THAT 
SAID IMMIGRANTS ON AVERAGE DON'T 
TAKE SOCIAL HOUSING IN 
DISPROPORTIONATE WAY THERE IS NO 
QUEUE JUMPING GOING ON 
ARE YOU 
USING YOUR OWN STATISTICS 
HOW IT 
IS REPORTED THE MAIL'S HEADLINE 
WAS A MILLION IMMIGRANTS LIVING OFF 
THE TAXPAYER SECOND BOTTOM 
SENTENCE SAYS THE REPORT ALSO 
FOUND NO SYSTEMATIC BIAS TOWARDS 
IMMIGRANTS 
AWAY FROM THE MEDIA IMMIGRANTS SPIN IF YOU ARE CHIEF OF POLICE YOU 
ARE IN TROUBLE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW 
MANY RESOURCES TO PUT WHERE DO 
YOU 
THERE IS AN IMPORTANT CASE YOU HERE ABOUT RESOURCES CHIEF POLICE 
OFFICERS MAKING A CLAIM FOR MORE 
RESOURCES HAVE A GOOD POINT THE 
PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT TECK TECHNICAL ARGUMENT 
FOR BUREAUCRATS TO BE HAVING WHAT 
HAPPENS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IS 
CRIMINALITY AND THE NEGATIVE STERP 
YEO TYPES AROUND IMMIGRANTS 
WE ARE 
CAREFUL NOT TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
JUST TYPE TO TAKE YOU TIME TO 
TAKE YOU THROUGH THE
