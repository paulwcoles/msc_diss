I'D LIKE SYD TO MEET THIS CHAP IF YOU'D SEE TO IT OF COURSE 
HELLO MAGNUS PYM 
WHO ARE YOU 
MY NAME IS PEGGY WENTWORTH PEGGY SHORT FOR MARGARET 
YOUR FATHER MR. RICHARD THEODORE PYM 
KILLED MY HUSBAND ARTHUR 
IF IT TAKES ME THE REST OF MY LIVING DEATH I'LL GET THE BASTARD FOR IT 
YOU'LL NEVER OPEN IT WITH A CHISEL 
I TRIED THAT YEARS AGO 
WE HAD A FARM IN CORNWALL CALLED TAMAR ROSE 
MY HUSBAND INHERITED IT FROM HIS FATHER 
IT WAS A TOUGH LIFE BUT IT WAS A LIVING IT WAS OURS 
BUT YOU CAN'T RUN A FARM IF YOU GET BOTH LEGS CUT OFF BELOW THE KNEE AND LOSE THE FINGERS OF ONE HAND 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ARTHUR 
MY HUSBAND FELL INTO THE THRESHING MACHINE 
HE WASN'T JUST A VICTIM HE WAS A FOOL AS WELL 
HE WAS MADE FOR RICKY PYM SURE HE WAS 
THERE WAS NINE THOUSAND COMPENSATION 
RICK CAME TO SEE ARTHUR IN HOSPITAL 
WASN'T HE THE FRIEND AND BENEFACTOR 
OH YES 
SEE THE FLOWERS AND THE CHOCOLATES AND THE CHAMPAGNE 
AND SEE THE GREAT TRUST FUND HE'LL SET UP WITH ARTHUR'S NINE THOUSAND 
TWELVE POINT FIVE PER CENT PLUS PROFITS MY DEAR YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT 
ENOUGH TO SEE DEAR OLD ARTHUR RIGHT FOR AS LONG AS HE'S SPARED 
AND ENOUGH FOR YOURSELF WHEN HE'S GONE 
AND ENOUGH LEFT OVER TO PUT BY FOR THAT FIRST RATE BOY OF YOURS FOR WHEN HE GOES TO COLLEGE 
SO ARTHUR SIGNS ALL THE DOCUMENTS SURE HE DOES MAGNUS WHY NOT 
SURE ISN'T RICK ALWAYS THERE TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE POOR MANGLED FOOL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND 
WHAT DOES ARTHUR WANT WITH NINE THOUSAND WHEN HE CAN HAVE RICKY AS A FRIEND 
THAT WAS THE BLOODY TRUTH OF IT 
WHEN ARTHUR DIED THERE WAS NO TRUST FUND THERE WAS 
THERE WAS LESS THAN NOTHING 
BECAUSE ON HIS DEATH BED ARTHUR MORTGAGED HIS FARM AND HIS LIVESTOCK 
AND BLOODY NEARLY HIS WIFE AND CHILD 
AND HE MADE OVER THE PROCEEDS TO HIS DEAR OLD PAL RICK 
WELL SEEING HE CAN BECKON YOU UP TO LONDON FIRST CLASS JUST WITH A FLICK OF HIS FINGERS 
BECAUSE HE THINKS YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE LAWYERS ON HIM WELL YOU GO 
AND THERE'S ONLY YOUR OWN BODY TO LOOK AT WITHERING AWAY IN THE MIRROR EVERY DAY 
WELL YOU GO 
IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS THIS PART HE ROBBED YOU THE REST DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
SEEING AS HE POSSESSES YOU ANYWAY 
HE'S ALREADY GOT HIS FILTHY ARMS ROUND YOU AS IF YOU WERE IN HIS FANCY BED WITH THE PINK FRILLS 
PLEASE PEGGY THE REST IS VERY PRIVATE 
SEEING HE ALREADY HAS THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH OVER YOU AND YOU'RE A FOOLISH LONELY WOMAN 
WITH A SICKLY BOY TO CARE FOR AND A BANKRUPT FARM TO MIND 
AND ONLY THE STUPID BAILIFF TO SAY NICE DAY TO WELL YOU GO DON'T YOU 
PLEASE PEGGY DON'T TELL ME ANY MORE 
GOD YOU GO YOU SCURRY UP THERE BURSTING TO HAVE THE FIGHT OF YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU SEE HIM 
AND WHEN YOU ARRIVE 
INSTEAD OF A BUSINESS CONFERENCE WITH MR. LOFT AND MR. BLOODY MUSPOLE AND THE WHOLE FILTHY GANG OF THEM 
THE MAN TAKES YOU TO BOND STREET 
AND HE BUYS YOU FINE CLOTHES AND TREATS YOU LIKE A PRINCESS 
WITH THE LIMOUSINE AND RESTAURANTS 
AND YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE YOUR ROW WITH HIM LATER CAN'T YOU 
NO YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE IT NOW OR NEVER 
I ALWAYS FANCIED YOU PEGGY YOU KNOW THAT 
ALWAYS HAD MY EYE ON THAT PRETTY IRISH SMILE OF YOURS 
AND NOT JUST THE SMILE EITHER 
SO WHY NOT IF HE FANCIES ME 
THERE'S MANY WORSE BASTARDS THAN HIM IN THE WORLD SO WHY NOT 
EXCEPT THERE AREN'T MANY WORSE BASTARDS THAN HIM MAGNUS 
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU HE SAYS 
AND WE STAND IN FRONT OF THIS STUPID GREEN FILING CABINET 
IN THERE ARE ALL THE RIGHTS AND WRONGS HE'S DONE 
OH HE'S SO PROUD OF IT 
HE'S SHOWING ME THE ROPE THEY OUGHT TO HANG HIM WITH AND HE'S MADE IT HIMSELF 
THE MAN'S MAD AS WELL AS EVERYTHING ELSE 
WHEN HE'S JUDGED HE SAYS EVERYTHING IN THIS CABINET WILL BE PUT INTO THE BALANCE 
AND WE'LL SEE HIM FOR WHAT HE WAS UP BESIDE THE ANGELS 
WHILE US POOR SINNERS DOWN HERE STARVE AND BLEED FOR HIS GLORY 
IMAGINE THAT RICKY BOY'S GOING TO CON HIS WAY TO HEAVEN 
I WANT JUSTICE I WANT HIM SHOWN UP FOR WHAT HE IS 
IF THE PROOF'S THERE LIKE HE SAYS IT IS I WANT IT 
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT 
PLEASE STOP NOW 
DEAR PEGGY 
I HOPE THE FOLLOWING WILL BE OF USE TO YOU 
PEOPLE STOP ME IN THE STREET 
RICK THEY SAY WHAT IS LIBERALISM EXCEPT A PACKAGE OF IDEALS 
WE CAN'T EAT IDEALS THEY SAY 
IDEALS DON'T BUY US A CUP OF TEA OR A NICE ENGLISH LAMB CHOP RICK OLD BOY 
WE CAN'T PUT OUR IDEALS IN THE COLLECTION BOX OR USE THEM TO PAY FOR OUR SON'S EDUCATION 
SO WHAT'S THE POINT RICK IN THIS MODERN WORLD OF OURS OF A PARTY OF IDEALS 
AND I SAY TO THESE GOOD PEOPLE 
AND I SAY TO YOU I SAY THIS
