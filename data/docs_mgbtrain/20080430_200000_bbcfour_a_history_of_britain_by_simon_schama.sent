IN THE SUMMER OF ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT THE ENGLISH COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR THINKING THEMSELVES UNCONQUERABLE 
THEY HAD VANQUISHED THE OLD ENEMIES THE SCOTS AND THE FRENCH 
THEIR KING EDWARD THE THIRD SEEMED THE MOST POWERFUL RULER IN EUROPE 
BUT THEY WOULD BE CONQUERED 
AND BY A KING AGAINST WHOM NEITHER LONGBOWS NOR WARSHIPS OFFERED ANY DEFENCE 
KING DEATH 
HIS WEAPON WAS PLAGUE 
AND BY THE END OF HIS TERRIBLE CAMPAIGN ALMOST HALF THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN WOULD BE DEAD 
THE COUNTRY WOULD SURVIVE THE TRAUMA 
BUT FIRST IT HAD TO UNDERGO A PURGATORY OF UNIMAGINABLE MISERY 
BECAUSE HARD ON THE HEELS OF PESTILENCE CAME REBELLION AND CIVIL WAR 
THE CENTURY OF PLAGUE WAS A PILGRIMAGE THROUGH PAIN AND THIS IS THE STORY OF THAT JOURNEY 
YERSINIA PESTIS THE GERM OF PLAGUE CAME TO BRITAIN IN THE GUTS OF INFECTED FLEAS 
THEY WERE HIDDEN AWAY IN CARGOES OF GRAIN BALES OF CLOTH AND IN THE FUR OF BLACK RATS 
THE MOST PROBABLE POINT OF ENTRY WAS MELCOMBE REGIS NEAR WEYMOUTH 
BY THE TIME IT GOT TO THE GREAT PORTS OF SOUTHAMPTON AND BRISTOL 
THERE WERE ALREADY STORIES FROM TRAUMATISED CITIES OF ITALY AS TO HOW AND WHERE IT HAD BEGUN 
IN THE EAST ON THE PLAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA ANOTHER OF THE HORRORS CARRIED ON THE BACKS OF THE MONGOL HORDES 
THE PLAGUE CUT A SWATHE OF DESTRUCTION EASTWARDS TO CHINA AND INDIA 
AND WESTWARDS INTO CRIMEA AND TURKEY 
AT THE PORT OF CAFFA THE TARTARS HAD THROWN INFECTED BODIES OVER THE CITY WALLS 
TO HASTEN THE SURRENDER OF THE DEFENDING GENOESE 
A FIRST IN THE ANNALS OF BIOLOGICAL WARFARE 
ONCE IT ARRIVED BY SEA IN ITALY IT SPREAD QUICKLY INTO MAINLAND EUROPE 
THERE HAD BEEN DEVASTATING CALAMITIES BEFORE VISITED ON BRITAIN 
COUNTLESS NUMBERS DIED IN THE APOCALYPTIC FAMINE OF ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
BUT IT WAS THE MERCILESS INDISCRIMINATE SWIFTNESS OF THE PLAGUE'S PROGRESS 
WHICH SO UNHINGED THE CITIES AND VILLAGES CAUGHT IN ITS ONSLAUGHT 
NO ONE RICH OR POOR COULD ESCAPE 
THIS IS HOW THE WELSH POET EUAN GEFFIN SAW IT 
WAITING FOR HIS OWN INFECTION WHICH SURE ENOUGH CAME IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE 
WE SEE DEATH COMING INTO OUR MIDST LIKE FOUL SMOKE 
A PLAGUE WHICH CUTS OFF THE YOUNG 
A ROOTLESS PHANTOM WHICH HAS NO MERCY 
WOE IS ME OF THE SHILLING IN THE ARMPIT 
IT IS IN THE FORM OF AN APPLE LIKE THE HEAD OF AN ONION 
GREAT IS ITS SEETHING LIKE A BURNING CINDER 
A GRIEVOUS THING OF ASHY COLOUR 
IT IS AN UGLY ERUPTION THAT COMES WITH UNSEEMLY HASTE 
THEY ARE LIKE A SHOWER OF PEAS THE EARLY ORNAMENTS OF BLACK DEATH 
IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT SIX DAYS FROM THE BITE OF AN INFECTED FLEA 
FOR THE TELL TALE SWELLINGS THE BUBOES TO APPEAR ON A VICTIM'S NECK GROIN OR ARMPIT 
ACCOMPANIED BY VIOLENT FEVER AND AGONISING PAIN 
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WOULD BE OVERWHELMED WITHIN A WEEK 
IF THE INFECTION REACHED THE LUNGS DEATH CAME AFTER JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS OF BLOODY COUGHING 
ANYONE WHO INHALED EVEN THE TINIEST DROPLETS OF MUCUS WOULD BE DOOMED TO SUFFER IN THEIR TURN 
NO ONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT AT THE TIME BUT THE TIGHTLY PACKED STREETS AND HOUSES OF A PLACE LIKE BRISTOL 
MADE A PERFECT FACTORY FARM FOR THE BACILLUS 
VERMIN CRAWLING WITH FLEAS LIVED ALONGSIDE THE CROWDED POPULATION OF PEOPLE AND ANIMALS 
THE NIBBLE OF A FLEA WAS A COMMON IRRITATION IN THIS LOUSY ANT HEAP WORLD 
AND EVEN WHEN THE BUBOES APPEARED THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT FLEAS OR RATS WERE RESPONSIBLE 
BUT THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT 
THE YOUNGEST AND THE OLDEST AND THE POOREST THOSE WITH LEAST RESISTANCE WOULD BE TAKEN FIRST 
BUT THEN EVERYONE ELSE TOO 
IN A TOWN THIS RIPE FOR INFECTION ALMOST HALF THE POPULATION WOULD HAVE PERISHED IN THE FIRST YEAR 
AMONG THEM FIFTEEN OF BRISTOL'S FIFTY TWO CITY COUNCILLORS 
THEIR NAMES STRUCK THROUGH AS THEY DIED 
TERRIFIED AND BEWILDERED THE HEALTHY ABANDONED THE SICK TO THEIR FATE 
WHOLE TOWNS VILLAGES EVEN FAMILIES WERE CRUELLY DIVIDED INTO THE LIVING AND THE DYING 
HUSBANDS WILL HAVE SHUNNED THEIR WIVES FATHERS AND MOTHERS RECOILED FROM CONTACT WITH THEIR CHILDREN 
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THE UTTER DESOLATION AND TERROR 
THE COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE TAKEN FOR GRANTED 
HOW DO YOU FIND BREAD NOW THE BAKERS ARE ALL DEAD 
HOW DO YOU FIND A PHYSIC NOW THAT NONE OF THEM WORK 
AND AT LAST HOW DO YOU FIND SOMEONE TO CART AWAY THE BODIES THAT HAVE TO BE DISPOSED OF SOMEWHERE 
THE BIGGER THE CITY THE GREATER THE SHOCK 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT LONDON HAD A POPULATION OF CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
IN THE FIRST WAVE OF THE PLAGUE THREE HUNDRED DIED EVERY DAY 
AT SPITALFIELDS THERE HAD LONG BEEN A MEDIEVAL HOSPITAL WITH A CEMETERY ATTACHED 
WITHIN ITS WALLS THE DEAD WERE DUTIFULLY LAID TO REST IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL GRAVES 
POINTING EAST SO THAT COME THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT THEY WOULD RISE AGAIN FACING TOWARDS JERUSALEM 
BUT IN THE GRIP OF THE EPIDEMIC THERE WAS NO TIME FOR SUCH PIETIES 
RECENT EXCAVATIONS HAVE TURNED UP MASS PITS 
WHERE BODIES WERE PITCHFORKED INTO THE DIRT IN HASTE AND DESPERATION 
UNEARTHED NOW JUST THE WAY THEY WERE DUMPED IN THEY LOOK AS IF THEY'RE PROTESTING AT THE INDIGNITY 
BY THE SUMMER OF ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THE PLAGUE HAD SPREAD TO THE FURTHEST CORNERS OF ENGLAND WALES AND SCOTLAND 
NOW IT TRAVELLED ACROSS THE SEA TO IRELAND 
ACCORDING TO JOHN CLYN A FRANCISCAN FRIAR WRITING AT KILKENNY 
FOURTEEN THOUSAND HAD PERISHED IN DUBLIN ALONE 
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD IT HAS BEEN UNHEARD OF FOR SO MANY PEOPLE TO DIE IN SUCH A SHORT TIME 
THIS PESTILENCE WAS SO CONTAGIOUS 
THAT THOSE WHO TOUCHED THE DEAD OR THE SICK WERE IMMEDIATELY INFECTED THEMSELVES 
I SEEING THESE MANY ILLS AND THAT THE WHOLE WORLD IS ENCOMPASSED BY EVIL 
WAITING AMONG THE DEAD FOR DEATH TO COME 
HAVE COMMITTED TO WRITING WHAT I TRULY HAVE HEARD AND EXAMINED 
AND I LEAVE PARCHMENT FOR CONTINUING THIS WORK IF PERCHANCE ANY MAN SURVIVE 
AND ANY OF THE RACE OF ADAM ESCAPE THIS PESTILENCE AND CARRY ON THE WORK WHICH I HAVE BEGUN 
AT THIS POINT ANOTHER HAND HAS WRITTEN HERE IT SEEMS THE AUTHOR DIED 
WHEN THE SURVIVORS RECOVERED FROM THE FIRST BRUTAL SHOCK OF THE BLACK DEATH 
THEY ASKED INEVITABLY WHY US WHY NOW 
THE BEST GUESS WAS THAT THE PLAGUE WAS CAUSED BY A CORRUPTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE PUTREFACTION 
THE MARK OF MEN AND BEASTS RISING FROM LAKES SWAMPS AND CHASMS 
THIS DANK SMOG EVEN HAD A NAME MIASMA 
IF SICKNESS GREW IN STENCH THEN SWEET SMELLS WERE AN OBVIOUS REMEDY 
PHYSICIANS AND HERBALISTS LOST NO TIME IN DEVISING RECIPES 
FOR POMANDERS AND POTIONS TO GUARD AGAINST INFECTION OR EVEN TO ACT AS AN ANTIDOTE FOR THE STRICKEN 
FIVE CUPS OF RUE IF IT BE A MAN AND IF IT BE A WOMAN LEAVE OUT THE RUE 
FIVE LITTLE BLADES OF COLUMBINE 
A GREAT QUANTITY OF MARIGOLD FLOWERS 
AN EGG THAT IS NEWLY LAID 
AND MAKE A HOLE IN ONE END AND BLOW OUT ALL THAT IS WITHIN 
AND LAY IT TO THE FIRE AND ROAST IT TILL GROUND TO POWDER BUT DO NOT BURN IT 
BREW ALL THESE HERBS WITH GOOD ALE BUT DO NOT STRAIN THEM 
AND MAKE THE SICK DRINK IT FOR THREE EVENINGS AND MORNINGS 
IF THEY HOLD IT IN THEIR STOMACH THEY SHALL HAVE LIFE 
BUT IF GOD DECIDED OTHERWISE ALL THE POTIONS IN THE WORLD WOULD BE OF NO AVAIL 
THE INESCAPABLE CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE PESTILENCE HAD BEEN LAID ON MANKIND 
AS A CHASTISEMENT FOR ITS MANIFOLD SINS 
LEWD NECKLINES LASCIVIOUS DANCING AND SHAMELESS ADULTERY HAD BROUGHT ON THE PLAGUE 
IT WOULD END WHEN THE WORLD WAS CONTRITE BUT IT NEVER SEEMED CONTRITE ENOUGH 
IN THE MEANTIME THE COUNTRY WAS LAID WASTE 
FARMS WERE ABANDONED 
WHOLE VILLAGES DESERTED 
THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE BISHOP OF WINCHESTER'S LANDS AT FARNHAM IN SURREY 
TELL THE STORY OF A RURAL SOCIETY IN SHOCK 
IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BLACK DEATH FIFTY TWO HOUSEHOLDS A GOOD THIRD OF THE VILLAGERS WERE WIPED OUT 
GIVEN THE MARK DEFECTUS PER PESTILENTUM 
THE FARNHAM ROLLS PUT NAMES TO THE NUMBERS NAMES LIKE MATILDA STICKER 
SHE DIED TOGETHER WITH HER ENTIRE FAMILY 
OR A SERVANT GIRL MATILDA TALVYN WHO SAW HER MASTER AND HIS ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD SUCCUMB TO THE PLAGUE 
BY THE TIME IT EBBED AWAY IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED HAD DIED IN FARNHAM 
WHILE THE PLAGUE TOOK IT COULD ALSO GIVE 
IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BLACK DEATH JOHN CROCHET WHO WAS A MINOR BECAME AN ORPHAN BUT AN ORPHAN WITH ASSETS 
BECAUSE HE COULD NOW INHERIT THE LOTS LEFT TO HIM BY HIS FATHER AND ANOTHER RELATIVE 
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN THE MAKING OF A SMALL BUT SERIOUS VILLAGE FORTUNE 
IN ANOTHER PLACE IN THE ROLLS WE LEARN THAT THE HARVEST HAD BECOME TWICE AS EXPENSIVE TO GATHER IN 
TWELVE PENCE WRITTEN IN ROMAN NUMERALS PER ACRE 
BECAUSE THE ROLLS SAY OF THE PLAGUE AND THE SCARCITY OF LABOUR 
WORKERS IT SEEMS WERE THIN ON THE GROUND AND WERE BEGINNING TO CHARGE ACCORDINGLY 
THE FARNHAM STORY COULD BE REPEATED ALL THROUGH BRITAIN 
THE COUNTRYSIDE AFTER THE BLACK DEATH WAS AN IRREVERSIBLY ALTERED WORLD 
FOR ONE THING THERE WERE NO MORE SERFS 
FOR CENTURIES BEING A SERF MEANT BEING TIED BY CUSTOM AND BY BIRTH TO YOUR LOCAL LORD 
HE GAVE YOU A TINY SPOT OF LAND ON WHICH YOU COULD FARM 
AND IN RETURN YOU PUT IN HOURS OF GRINDING TOIL UNPAID ON HIS VERY BIG FARM 
THERE WERE OTHER WAYS TOO IN WHICH YOU WERE NOT FREE 
YOU HAD TO ASK HIS PERMISSION TO MARRY AND YOU WERE NOT REPEAT NOT EVER TO LEAVE 
UNTIL THAT IS THE BLACK DEATH 
NOW THERE WAS A DESPERATE LABOUR SHORTAGE 
THE LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND MEANT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU COULD SET THE TERMS OF THE DEAL 
HE WANTED SOME LABOUR OUT OF YOU YOU COULD SAY WHY NOT START BY PAYING ME SOMETHING 
HE WANTS YOU TO MOVE IN TO A PIECE OF LAND WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD GO TO RACK AND RUIN 
AND YOU SAY O. K. CUT THE RENT 
AND IF THE LORD THEN SAYS NOT A CHANCE YOU IMPERTINENT SO AND SO 
YOU JUST UP STICKS AND FIND SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S GOT A MORE SECURE GRIP ON THE NEW ECONOMIC FACTS OF LIFE 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEASANTS MUST HAVE DONE JUST THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ANYBODY COULD DO ABOUT IT 
IT WAS NOT JUST THE SOCIAL ORDER THAT THE PLAGUE SHOOK LOOSE 
IT ALSO ATE AWAY AT THE SENSE OF SECURITY OFFERED BY THE CHURCH 
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE REGULAR CLERGY SEEMED POWERLESS TO PROVIDE HELP FOR THE AFFLICTED 
OR EVEN FOR THEMSELVES 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THE BISHOP OF BATH AND WELLS SEEING THAT THERE WAS A SERIOUS SHORTAGE OF PRIESTS 
AUTHORISED LAYMEN TO HEAR THE CONFESSION OF THE DYING 
OR HE WROTE EVEN A WOMAN IF NO MAN IS AVAILABLE 
THE MOST DARING TOOK MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS SEEKING REDEMPTION DIRECTLY FROM THE SCRIPTURES 
THE LOLLARDS OR MUMBLERS TOOK THEIR NAME FROM THEIR MOUTHING OUT LOUD OF THE BIBLE 
AND ENCOURAGED OTHERS TO DO THE SAME BY TRANSLATING IT INTO ENGLISH 
LIBERATING IT FROM THE OBSCURITY OF LATIN 
AS FEW AS THEY WERE THE LOLLARDS WERE A DRAMATIC THREAT TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH 
THEY WERE ONLY SAVED FROM PERSECUTION BY THE PROTECTION OF THEIR MOST POWERFUL PATRON 
KING EDWARD'S THIRD SON JOHN OF GAUNT THE DUKE OF LANCASTER 
MEN LIKE HIM WERE DRAWN TO NEW FORMS OF PIETY AND PENANCE 
BECAUSE THE PLAGUE HAD MADE THEM ACUTELY AWARE THAT KING DEATH WAS NO RESPECTER OF RANK OR WEALTH 
SHOULD HE STRIKE WITHOUT WARNING THEY HAD BETTER BE READY FOR A RECKONING 
THEY ALL KNEW THE CAUTIONARY TALE OF THE THREE LIVING AND THE THREE DEAD 
A TRIO OF HANDSOME YOUNG KINGS OUT FOR A DECENT DAY'S SPORT 
THE THREE LIVING PIPE UP I'M AFRAID 
LO BUT I SEE AND METHINKS THESE DEVILS BE 
BACK COME THE OTHER THREE 
SUCH SHALL YOU BE 
I WAS WELL FAIR AND FOR GOD'S LOVE BEWARE 
THE FURTHEST GONE OF THE GRUESOME THREESOME THEN MAKES A LITTLE SPEECH 
KNOW THAT I WAS HEAD OF MY TRIBE PRINCES KINGS AND NOBLES ROYAL AND RICH REJOICING IN WEALTH 
BUT NOW I AM SO HIDEOUS AND BARE THAT EVEN THE WORMS DISDAIN ME 
THIS WAS AN INVASION THAT PLANTAGENET ENGLAND HAD NOT PREPARED FOR 
THE INVASION OF THE SPACE OF THE LIVING BY THE DEAD 
THE SENSE THAT THE BORDERS BETWEEN BACKYARDS AND BONEYARDS HAD COLLAPSED PRODUCED A SUDDEN NERVOUSNESS 
IN THE FACE OF KING DEATH 
NEITHER RICHES NOR EARTHLY FAME COULD BUY SALVATION OR GUARANTEE IMMORTALITY 
THIS INSECURITY FOUND EXPRESSION IN A VERY PECULIAR KIND OF TOMB 
THE TRANSEY WHICH MEANS APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH GONE OFF 
IN TRANSEY TOMBS LIKE THIS ONE AT CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL YOU GOT REMEMBERED TWICE OVER 
THEY WERE DOUBLE DECKER AFFAIRS 
IN THE TOP DECK YOU WERE SEEN VERY MUCH IN THE GUISE THE WORLD EXPECTED 
AS A KNIGHT IN ARMOUR OR A BISHOP IN FULL EPISCOPAL RIG 
IN THE LOWER DECK THOUGH THERE YOU WERE A NAKED SKELETON 
THE FLESH FALLEN AWAY FROM THE BONE 
NOW THE MINDSET THAT PRODUCED THE TRANSEY TOMB WAS A KIND OF REVERSE ENVY 
A DETERMINATION TO FALL BEHIND THE JONES'S TO BOW TO NO ONE IN YOUR PAINFUL AWARENESS 
THAT HOWEVER GRAND YOU WERE PRETTY SOON YOU WERE GOING TO BE REDUCED TO A HEAP OF DUST AND MAGGOTS 
THE IDEA WAS TO CONTRAST AS SHOCKINGLY AS POSSIBLE TWO SORTS OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS 
ON THE ONE HAND THE WAY WE SHOULD LIKE TO BE REMEMBERED DYING IN SPLENDOUR AND PIETY 
AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE WAY WE REALLY ARE 
PATHETIC IN OUR CADAVEROUS MORTALITY 
I WAS PAUPER BORN READS THE INSCRIPTION ON ARCHBISHOP CHICHELE'S TOMB 
THEN TO PRIMATE RAISED 
NOW I AM CUT DOWN AND SERVED UP FOR WORMS 
BEHOLD MY GRAVE 
ONLY THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND SEEMED TO HAVE SURVIVED UNSCATHED 
EDWARD THE THIRD ONCE THE GLAMOROUS INVINCIBLE WARRIOR WAS NOW AN AGEING FATHER TO A FRAGILE NATION 
STILL THE ROYAL SUCCESSION SEEMED SECURE 
EDWARD'S SON THE BLACK PRINCE THE HEIR TO THE THRONE WAS ALREADY A LEGENDARY HERO 
BUT THEN AGAINST ALL EXPECTATION THE PICTURE CHANGED 
THE BLACK PRINCE SUCCUMBED TO DYSENTERY IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX 
AND A YEAR LATER THE OLD KING HIMSELF FINALLY EXPIRED 
AND SO THE CROWN PASSED TO EDWARD'S GRANDSON RICHARD OF BORDEAUX 
A BOY KING CALLED UPON BEFORE HIS TIME RICHARD WAS RULER IN NAME ONLY 
EVERYONE KNEW THAT HIS UNCLE JOHN OF GAUNT WORKED THE REAL LEVERS OF POWER 
RICHARD'S CORONATION WAS ORCHESTRATED BY JOHN OF GAUNT AS A FESTIVAL OF LOYALTY 
A STATEMENT OF FAITH IN THE UNDIMMED FUTURE OF ENGLAND'S GLORY 
THERE HAD BEEN NO CORONATION FOR HALF A CENTURY 
BUT THE MIX OF SOLEMNITY AND FESTIVITY NEVER FAILED TO WORK ITS SPELL 
KNIGHTS OF THE SHIRE RODE IN FROM ALL OVER ENGLAND TO WITNESS THE SPECTACLE 
THE NEXT DAY IN THE ABBEY LITTLE RICHARD HAD HIS SHIRT TAKEN OFF HIM BEHIND A GOLDEN SCREEN 
AND HIS FACE HANDS AND CHEST TOUCHED WITH THE HOLY OIL 
AS THEY LISTENED TO HIM IN HIS LITTLE BOY'S VOICE PROMISE TO PROTECT THE CHURCH 
DO JUSTICE AND RESPECT THE LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF HIS ANCESTORS 
THE ASSEMBLY OF NOBLES AND PRIESTS MUST HAVE IMAGINED HIM 
GROWING TO FIT THE HUGE THRONE OF HIS FEROCIOUS GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER EDWARD I 
INEVITABLY AS THE LONG CEREMONY DRONED ON IN THE DARKNESS RICHARD FELL ASLEEP 
AS HE WAS CARRIED FROM THE ABBEY HIS LEGS DANGLING ONE OF HIS OVERSIZED SLIPPERS FELL OFF 
BUT WHO COULD THINK THAT AN ILL OMEN 
HE WAS AFTER ALL ONLY TEN 
HOW WAS THE CHILD MARKED BY ALL THIS 
TWENTY TWO YEARS LATER DID HE REMEMBER THIS MOMENT OF ANOINTING AS A KIND OF APOTHEOSIS 
A MAGICAL TRANSFORMATION FROM A LITTLE MAN INTO A LITTLE GOD 
PERHAPS IT WAS JUST AS WELL THAT RICHARD MISTOOK HIMSELF FOR A MESSIAH 
SINCE ONLY SOMEONE WITH THAT KIND OF INNATE SELF CONFIDENCE COULD HAVE FACED DOWN AT THE TENDER AGE OF FOURTEEN 
THE MOST VIOLENT UPHEAVAL IN THE HISTORY OF MEDIEVAL ENGLAND 
IT HAPPENED WITH ASTOUNDING TERRIFYING SWIFTNESS STARTING IN THE KIND OF PLACE YOU'D LEAST EXPECT IT 
NOT SOME DESTITUTE MUD HOLE IN THE BACK OF BEYOND 
BUT IN THE MOST ECONOMICALLY DEVELOPED REGION OF RURAL ENGLAND 
THE BELT OF RICH FERTILE COUNTRY STRETCHING FROM KENT OVER THE MEDWAY AND THAMES TO ESSEX AND EAST ANGLIA 
THE THING ABOUT THE PEASANTS' REVOLT IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO STARTED IT WEREN'T REALLY PEASANTS AT ALL 
AT ANY RATE THEY WEREN'T THE STRAW CHEWING PITCHFORK WAVING YOKELS OF LEGEND 
NO THEY WERE PEOPLE WITH SOMETHING TO LOSE THE VILLAGE ELITE 
MEN WHO'D SERVED AS CONSTABLES AND STEWARDS AND JURORS 
MEN WHO'D MOVED INTO THOSE VACANT LOTS THAT HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND BY VICTIMS OF THE PLAGUE 
THEY'D MADE SOME MONEY AND WEREN'T ABOUT TO SEE IT GO DOWN THE DRAIN 
IN ORDER TO LINE THE POCKETS OF SOME LAWYER AND PEN PUSHER IN WESTMINSTER 
WHAT'S MORE THEY KNEW HOW TO MAKE AN ARMY OUT OF THOSE ONE RUNG DOWN ON THE SOCIAL LADDER 
FAMILIES JUST ABOVE THE POVERTY LINE WHO HAD TO SELL THEIR LABOUR TO MAKE ENDS MEET 
THEY WERE ALREADY ANGRY AT GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO PEG BACK THEIR STEADILY RISING WAGES TO PRE PLAGUE LEVELS 
THE BALANCE HAD TIPPED IN FAVOUR OF THE SURVIVORS AND THEY WERE DETERMINED TO KEEP IT THAT WAY 
IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE OR THOUGHT THEY WERE UP AND COMERS 
AND THEY WOULD FIGHT IF NECESSARY TO PREVENT THEMSELVES FROM SINKING INTO THE DOWN AND OUTERS 
WAS THIS A CLASS WAR A PHRASE WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO USE SINCE THE OFFICIAL BURIAL OF MARXISM 
YES IT WAS 
THE SUSPICION AMONGST THE MEN OF VILLAGE ENGLAND WAS THAT THE REAL POWER BEHIND THE THRONE 
JOHN OF GAUNT THE QUEEN MOTHER AND THE CHANCELLOR WERE GATHERING IN FRESH TAXES 
NOT TO FINANCE A PATRIOTIC WAR IN FRANCE BUT TO LAVISH ON THEIR OWN PALACES AND PRIVATE ESTATES 
SO WHEN IN NOVEMBER ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY PARLIAMENT APPROVED A NEW POLL TAX 
ONE WHICH FOR THE FIRST TIME TOOK NO ACCOUNT OF INDIVIDUAL WEALTH 
THE YEOMEN FARMERS MUST HAVE IMAGINED THE AWFUL PROSPECT 
OF ALL THEIR HARD WON GAINS BEING SNATCHED BACK BY A GREEDY GOVERNMENT 
THERE WAS OUTRAGE BLOODY MINDED FURY AND MASS EVASION WHICH ESCALATED INTO OUTRIGHT REBELLION 
TAX COLLECTORS AND SHERIFF'S MEN WERE ATTACKED A FEW KILLED 
IN MAIDSTONE THEY ELECTED WAT TYLER A YEOMAN CRAFTSMAN AS THEIR GENERAL AND CAPTAIN 
AND FREED A LOLLARD ANTI CLERIC CALLED JOHN BALL WHO'D BEEN IMPRISONED IN THE BISHOP'S PALACE 
JOHN BALL IS A RECOGNISABLE TYPE 
A PREACHING FRIAR WHO PUSHES BLACK DEATH RADICALISM TO ITS LOGICAL EXTREME 
GET RID OF THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE PROPERTY OWNERS BALL ARGUED 
AND CHRIST'S EMBRACE OF THE POOR WILL ONCE AGAIN BE HONOURED 
ARE WE NOT DESCENDED FROM THE SAME PARENTS ADAM AND EVE 
AND WHAT REASON CAN THEY GIVE WHY THEY SHOULD BE MORE MASTERS THAN OURSELVES 
THEY ARE CLOTHED IN VELVET AND RICH ERMINE WHILE WE ARE FORCED TO WEAR POOR CLOTHING 
THEY HAVE WINES AND FINE SPICES AND FINE BREAD 
WHILE WE HAVE ONLY RYE AND THE REFUSE OF THE STRAW AND WHEN WE DRINK IT MUST BE WATER 
WE ARE CALLED SLAVES IF WE DO NOT PERFORM OUR SERVICES WE'RE BEATEN 
LET US GO TO THE KING AND REMONSTRATE WITH HIM 
WE MAY OBTAIN A FAVOURABLE ANSWER 
AND IF NOT WE MUST SEEK TO AMEND OUR CONDITIONS OURSELVES 
AND SO THEY MARCHED THE LEVELLING FEVER OF THE BLACK DEATH BUZZING IN THEIR BRAINS 
SLOGANS OF EQUALITY AND RETRIBUTION IN THEIR MOUTHS 
AFTER ALL WHO WERE WAT TYLER JOHN BULL AND ROBERT KAYE OF THE DARTFORD BAKER BUT THE THREE DEAD 
CONFRONTING THE SPOILED RICH AND MIGHTY WITH THEIR DAY OF JUDGEMENT 
ON THE MORNING OF TWELFTH JUNE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE AN ENORMOUS ARMY 
AT LEAST FIVE THOUSAND PERHAPS AS MANY AS TEN THOUSAND STRONG 
WAS CAMPED HERE ON THE FIELDS OF BLACKHEATH ON THE EDGE OF LONDON 
BELOW THEM THEY COULD SEE THE CITY 
OLD SAINT PAUL'S THE BRIDGES CROWDED WITH SHOPS AND WESTMINSTER BEYOND 
ALL SEEMINGLY AT THEIR MERCY 
THIS WAS NOT A RABBLE FROM THE START OF THE REVOLT ITS TARGETS HAD BEEN SELECTED CAREFULLY TO MAKE A POINT 
RICH ABBEYS ESTATES BELONGING TO TAX COLLECTORS 
ANY DOCUMENT BEARING THE SEAL OF THE EXCHEQUER WAS MARKED OUT FOR DESTRUCTION 
MANORIAL ACCOUNTS WERE BURNED THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING 
PARADOXICALLY THE REBELS REMAINED FERVENTLY LOYAL TO THE CROWN 
THOUGH THEY HAD MADE THEMSELVES OUTLAWS THEY WERE FIRED BY THE CERTAINTY THAT THEIR CAUSE WAS JUST 
SURELY IT WOULD BE SEEN THAT THEY WERE NOT THREATENING THE KING BUT RESCUING HIM AS WELL AS THEMSELVES 
THE DISCIPLINE OF THE MARCH HOWEVER DID NOT SURVIVE CONTACT WITH THE BIG CITY 
PRISONS WERE BROKEN OPEN CHURCHES LOOTED PALACES PUT TO THE TORCH 
THIRTY FIVE FLEMISH MERCHANTS WERE DECAPITATED ON THE SAME BLOCK ONE AFTER THE OTHER 
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY SIMON SUDBURY WAS CAPTURED WHILE AT HIS PRAYERS IN THE CHAPEL OF SAINT JOHN 
THE RAMPAGING REBELS HACKED HIS HEAD OFF STUCK IT ON A SPIKE AND PARADED IT TRIUMPHANTLY THROUGH THE STREETS 
ON THE EVENING OF THURSDAY THIRTEENTH JUNE THE TEENAGE KING CLIMBED ONE OF THE TURRETS IN THE TOWER 
AND WHAT HE SAW OUGHT TO HAVE BROKEN HIM IN TERROR 
THE SKY RED WITH FLAMES 
LONDON CRUMBLING INTO SMOKING RUINS 
BUT HOSTAGE TO A NIGHTMARE RICHARD DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE PANICKED 
WHEN THE COUNCILLORS ASKED HIM NEGOTIATE WITH THE REBELS HE EVIDENTLY SHOWED NO HESITATION 
IT WAS THE BOY WHO WAS THE MAN OF THE HOUR 
IT WAS A BRAVE FRONT FOR RICHARD MUST HAVE THOUGHT THERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE HE MIGHT NOT SURVIVE 
BEFORE HIS MEETING WITH THE REBELS 
HE PRAYED AT THE SHRINE OF EDWARD THE CONFESSOR THE PATRON SAINT OF ALL THE PLANTAGENET KINGS 
THEN HE RODE THROUGH THE JOSTLING CROWDS TO MEET WAT TYLER AND THE REST OF THE LEADERS AT SMITHFIELD 
WHEN HE GOT TO SMITHFIELD THE KING COULD SEE THE REBELS CAMPED ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE FIELD 
AND THE ROYAL PARTY ON THE EAST 
WAT TYLER RODE OVER TO RICHARD GOT OFF HIS LITTLE HORSE KNELT VERY BRIEFLY NOT VERY CONVINCINGLY 
BUT THEN SHAKES HIS HAND AND CALLS HIM BROTHER 
WHY WILL YOU NOT GO HOME ASKED THE KING RATHER PLAINTIVELY 
TO WHICH TYLER RESPONDED WITH A LOUD CURSE AND A SET OF DEMANDS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS FOR A NEW MAGNA CARTA FOR THE ORDINARY PEOPLE 
IT WOULD ABOLISH SERFDOM LIQUIDATE THE PROPERTY OF THE CHURCH 
IT WOULD OFFER A GENERAL PARDON TO ALL OUTLAWS 
AND IF ALL THIS WASN'T RADICAL ENOUGH IT WOULD MAKE EVERY MAN EQUAL BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE KING 
NOW TO ALL THIS RICHARD ANSWERED YES PERHAPS CROSSING HIS FINGERS BEHIND HIS BACK 
AND MAYBE WAT TYLER WAS SO AMAZED BY THE CONCESSION HE DIDN'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT 
SO AN EERIE SILENCE SETTLES OVER EVERYBODY ON THE FIELD BROKEN ONLY BY TYLER ASKING FOR A FLAGON OF ALE 
HE GETS IT HE DOWNS IT HE GETS BACK ON TO HIS MOUNT A BIG MAN ON A LITTLE HORSE 
AND AT THAT MOMENT HISTORY CHANGED 
THERE WAS SOMEONE ON THE KING'S SIDE WHO HAD NOT BEEN READING THE SCRIPT 
OR PERHAPS WAS JUST UNABLE TO TAKE THE HUMILIATION ANY LONGER 
IT WAS A YOUNG ESQUIRE SOMEONE RICHARD'S OWN AGE WHO SHOUTED AT TYLER THAT HE WAS A THIEF 
IT BROKE THE STRANGE SPELL 
WALWORTH THE MAYOR WHO HAD ALWAYS TAKEN A HARD LINE TRIED TO ARREST TYLER 
THERE WAS HORSEBACK FIGHTING 
WALWORTH GETTING IN THE DECISIVE BLOW CUTTING TYLER THROUGH THE SHOULDER AND NECK 
AS SOON AS HE WAS DOWN THE KING'S MEN SURROUNDED HIM FINISHING HIM OFF 
BUT MAKING SURE THE REBEL CAMP COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON 
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THIS WAS THE MOMENT OF TRUTH 
IT WAS ALSO THE MOMENT WHEN RICHARD HIMSELF ACTED DECISIVELY AND WITH AMAZING COURAGE 
HE RODE STRAIGHT AT THE REBELS SHOUTING FAMOUSLY YOU SHALL HAVE NO CAPTAIN BUT ME 
THE WORDS WERE BRILLIANTLY CHOSEN AND WERE OF COURSE DELIBERATELY AMBIGUOUS 
TO THE REBELS IT SEEMED THAT RICHARD HIMSELF WAS NOW THEIR LEADER JUST AS THEY'D ALWAYS WANTED 
BUT THE WORDS COULD HAVE BEEN MEANT AS THE FIRST REASSERTION OF ROYAL AUTHORITY 
EITHER WAY IT DEFUSED THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS 
AND GAVE MAYOR WALWORTH THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK TO LONDON AND MOBILISE ARMED MEN 
NOW THE PROCESS OF BREAKING UP THE LEADERLESS REBELLION COULD BEGIN 
CAUTIOUSLY AT FIRST WITH OFFERS OF PARDONS AND MERCY BUT THEN WITH IMPLACABLE RESOLUTION 
JUST A WEEK AFTER THE APPARENT CONCESSIONS AT SMITHFIELD 
ANOTHER GROUP OF REBELS MET WITH RICHARD AT WALTHAM IN ESSEX BUT THEY FOUND A VERY DIFFERENT KING 
YOU WRETCHES DETESTABLE ON LAND AND SEA YOU WHO SEEK EQUALITY WITH LORDS ARE UNWORTHY TO LIVE 
GIVE THIS MESSAGE TO YOUR COLLEAGUES RUSTICS YOU WERE AND RUSTICS YOU ARE STILL 
YOU WILL REMAIN IN BONDAGE NOT AS BEFORE BUT INCOMPARABLY HARSHER 
FOR AS LONG AS WE LIVE WE WILL STRIVE TO SUPPRESS YOU 
AND YOUR MISERY WILL BE AN EXAMPLE IN THE EYES OF POSTERITY 
HOWEVER WE WILL SPARE YOUR LIVES IF YOU REMAIN FAITHFUL 
CHOOSE NOW WHICH COURSE YOU WANT TO FOLLOW 
THE REBELS TOOK THE ONLY OPTION THAT WAS REALISTICALLY OPEN TO THEM 
THEY FELL TO THEIR KNEES IT WAS ALL OVER THE KING WAS LITERALLY THE ONLY ONE LEFT STANDING 
BUT WHAT WAS THE EFFECT OF ALL THIS ON RICHARD WHAT DID HE NOW THINK HE WAS CAPABLE OF 
MY MASTER GOD OMNIPOTENT 
IS MUSTERING IN HIS CLOUDS ON OUR BEHALF ARMIES OF PESTILENCE 
AND THEY SHALL STRIKE YOUR CHILDREN YET UNBORN AND UNBEGOT 
THAT LIFT YOUR VASSAL HANDS AGAINST MY HEAD AND THREAT THE GLORY OF MY PRECIOUS CROWN 
THOUGH SHAKESPEARE STARTS HIS TRAGEDY YEARS AFTER THE PEASANTS' REVOLT 
IT'S HARD NOT TO BELIEVE THAT IN HIS PORTRAIT OF A PETULANT SELF ADMIRING RICHARD THE SECOND 
THERE IS THE SENSE OF SOMEONE TRAPPED IN AN ADOLESCENT FANTASY OF INDESTRUCTIBILITY 
THERE'S NO DENYING THAT ESPECIALLY AT TIMES OF CRISIS HE WAS SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS 
BETWEEN ADRENALINE RUSH FEELINGS OF OMNIPOTENCE AND ABJECT FATALISM 
BUT IT IS EASY TO EXAGGERATE HIS UNFITNESS TO RULE 
AS THOUGH HE WERE SOMEHOW SUSPICIOUSLY UNSOUND 
HE WAS BUILT THE USUAL PLANTAGENET WAY 
SIX FOOT TALL WITH LONG FLOWING BLOND HAIR 
BUT UNLIKE HIS GRANDFATHER HE FAILED TO KEEP MISTRESSES 
AND SEEMED ODDLY ENOUGH TO WANT TO BE FAITHFUL TO HIS WIFE ANNE 
REAL PLANTAGENETS TORE AT THEIR MEAT AND SLURPED THE DRIPPINGS RICHARD NOT ONLY INSISTED ON USING A SPOON 
BUT INFLICTED IT ON THE REST OF THE COURT 
REAL PLANTAGENETS WON BLOOD SOAKED VICTORIES OVER FRANCE AND SCOTLAND 
RICHARD BROUGHT ENGLAND THE POCKET HANDKERCHIEF 
REAL PLANTAGENETS BUILT FORTRESSES 
RICHARD INSTEAD WANTED A GREAT CEREMONIAL SPACE IN WESTMINSTER HALL WITH A SPECTACULAR HAMMER BEAM ROOF 
THE ROWS OF ANGELS SYMBOLISED THE KING'S DIVINE RIGHT TO RULE 
THE ANGELS IN TURN ARE SUPPORTED BY CARVED STONE PLINTHS 
BEARING RICHARD'S OWN EMBLEM THE WHITE HART 
BUT THE ALIEN STRANGENESS ATTRIBUTED TO RICHARD SEEMS A LOT LESS STRANGE 
IF YOU THINK OF HIM AS A RENAISSANCE PRINCE 
FOR WHOM THE IDEA OF THE CIVILISED LIFE WAS NOT NECESSARILY A MARK OF BEING UN ENGLISH 
THE WILTON DIPTYCH IS THE CLEAREST ILLUSTRATION OF HIS EXALTED VISION OF KINGSHIP 
RICHARD INSTINCTIVELY FELT HE BELONGED IN THE COMPANY OF SAINTS 
SO HERE HE IS WITH THREE OF THEM 
JOHN THE BAPTIST 
EDWARD THE CONFESSOR 
AND THE SAXON MARTYR KING EDMUND 
THE OTHER PANEL REVEALS HIM TO BE IN THE EVEN MORE EXALTED COMPANY 
OF ANGELS THE CHRIST CHILD AND THE VIRGIN 
HE IS HER APPOINTED LIEUTENANT 
SHE IS RECEIVING HIS KINGDOM AS HER DOWRY 
AND IN RETURN WILL BESTOW ON IT HER SPECIAL PROTECTION AND FAVOUR 
CEREMONIAL STYLE WAS NOT THE KING DECIDED JUST AN AFFECTATION 
THE WINDOW DRESSING OF POWER 
IT WAS AT THE HEART OF ITS MYSTERY ITS CAPACITY TO MAKE MEN OBEY 
THIS IS WHAT RICHARD HAD IN MIND WHEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE BRITISH MONARCHIES 
THE KING LET IT BE KNOWN HE SHOULD LIKE TO BE ADDRESSED AS MAJESTY AND HIGHNESS 
A KIND OF MYSTICAL ELEVATION 
BUT WHAT SEEMED LIKE REFINEMENT TO RICHARD 
TO THE BARONS WAS EVIDENCE THAT THE KING HAD LOST TOUCH WITH THEIR COMMON INTERESTS 
RICHARD'S REFUSAL TO CONTINUE THE WAR WITH FRANCE WAS AN OBVIOUS SOURCE OF IRRITATION FOR THE NOBILITY 
THEY PROSPERED FROM FOREIGN CAMPAIGNS 
AND BUILT SPECTACULAR CASTLES LIKE THIS ONE AT BODIUM TO GUARD AGAINST A FRENCH INVASION 
BUT IT WAS THE KING'S HIGH HANDEDNESS THAT FINALLY STUNG THEM INTO ACTION 
BY ISSUING ROYAL DECREES RICHARD COULD BYPASS PARLIAMENT 
HE LAVISHED FAVOURS ON HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS AND ADVISERS 
MEN LIKE SIR SIMON BURLEIGH AND ROBERT DE VERE WHO WAS ABSURDLY PROMOTED TO BE DUKE OF IRELAND 
THE LORDS RETALIATED WITH THEIR ONLY AVAILABLE WEAPON PARLIAMENT 
IN FEBRUARY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE OF THE KING'S FAVOURITES 
WERE CHARGED WITH ABUSING HIS YOUTH AND INNOCENCE TO PROMOTE THEIR OWN AMBITIONS 
ALL WERE FOUND GUILTY OF TREASON BY WHAT BECAME KNOWN AS THE MERCILESS PARLIAMENT 
ROBERT DE VERE THE MOST HATED OF THE KING'S CONFIDANTS 
ESCAPED BEFORE SENTENCE OF EXECUTION COULD BE CARRIED OUT BUT SIMON BURLEIGH WAS NOT SO LUCKY 
RICHARD'S QUEEN PLEADED ON HER KNEES FOR BURLEIGH'S LIFE 
BUT TO NO AVAIL 
RICHARD MAY HAVE CRUSHED THE PEASANTS' REVOLT BUT PEERS OF THE REALM WERE ANOTHER MATTER 
CHASTENED BY THE HUMILIATION THE KING WITHDREW INTO AUTOCRATIC SOLITUDE 
AND YET HE HAD ENOUGH OF THE PLANTAGENET ABOUT HIM TO HARBOUR DESIRES FOR RETRIBUTION 
HE HELD HIS PEACE FOR NEARLY TEN YEARS 
BUT WHEN HIS BELOVED QUEEN ANNE DIED OF PLAGUE RICHARD LOST HIS ONLY RESTRAINING INFLUENCE 
AND HE REASSERTED HIMSELF IN AN EXTRAORDINARY STORM OF REVENGE 
USING THE PRETEXT OF AN ARISTOCRATIC PLOT 
HE BRUTALLY DISPOSED OF THE RINGLEADERS OF THE MERCILESS PARLIAMENT A DECADE EARLIER 
THE EARL OF ARUNDEL WAS EXECUTED THE EARL OF WARWICK WAS EXILED 
AND THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER RICHARD'S OWN UNCLE WAS MURDERED SMOTHERED IN HIS BED ON THE KING'S ORDERS 
THE OLD SCORES HAD BEEN SETTLED AT LAST 
YOU WOULD THINK THAT RICHARD WOULD CONTAIN HIS SENSE OF TRIUMPH 
IF ONLY IN THE INTEREST OF SELF PRESERVATION 
BUT NOW THAT RICHARD THE SECOND DISCOVERED THAT PEOPLE WERE FOR THE FIRST TIME FRIGHTENED OF HIM 
HE ALSO DISCOVERED HE RATHER LIKED IT 
HE DRANK IT IN AND LASHED OUT AT ANYBODY HE THOUGHT WAS DISLOYAL 
REPLACING THEM WITH YES MEN AND TOADIES 
EATING SLEEPING AND TRAVELLING SURROUNDED BY A PRIVATE ARMY AS IF HE WERE SOME SORT OF ROMAN EMPEROR 
BENEATH THESE DELUSIONS OF OMNIPOTENCE THOUGH RICHARD REMAINED NEUROTICALLY INSECURE 
ON THE MEREST SUSPICION OF TREASON 
HE RASHLY CONDEMNED JOHN OF GAUNT'S SON HENRY BOLINGBROKE TO TEN YEARS IN EXILE 
WITHOUT EVEN THE PRETENCE OF A SHOW TRIAL 
IF SUCH SUMMARY JUSTICE MADE THE ENGLISH NOBILITY UNEASY WHAT HAPPENED NEXT LEFT THEM STUNNED 
WHEN JOHN OF GAUNT FINALLY DIED RICHARD DECIDED TO INCREASE BOLINGBROKE'S SENTENCE 
TO BANISHMENT FOR LIFE AND SEIZED THE YOUNG DUKE'S INHERITANCE 
THE VALUABLE LANCASTRIAN ESTATES IN THE NAME OF THE CROWN 
THE MAGNATES OF ENGLAND MUST HAVE LOOKED AT THIS AND SAID HE'S GOT TO BE STOPPED OR IT'S MY TURN NEXT 
RICHARD WAS ONE BLUNDER AWAY FROM DISASTER 
THE FINAL FATAL DISTRACTION WAS IRELAND 
HE HAD DECIDED TO BRING THE IRISH PRINCES TO HEEL 
BUT HE TOOK WITH HIM ENOUGH SOLDIERS TO LEAVE HIMSELF DEFENCELESS AT HOME 
AND NOT ENOUGH TO COW THE IRISH NOBLES 
AND BEFORE HE COULD FINISH HIS BUSINESS THERE 
HE HEARD NEWS THAT HENRY BOLINGBROKE HAD LANDED WITH AN ARMY ON THE YORKSHIRE COAST 
AND THE ALIENATED ENGLISH LORDS HAD FLOCKED TO HIS BANNER 
BY THE TIME RICHARD RETURNED 
BOLINGBROKE WAS IN COMMAND OF THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN HEARTLAND OF ENGLAND 
THE ODD THING IS THAT RICHARD SEEMED TO BE ONE STEP AHEAD OF HIS ENEMIES IN FATALISTIC PESSIMISM 
SO THAT WHEN HE GOT THE BAD NEWS 
THAT MANY OF HIS MOST TRUSTED SUPPORTERS AND ALLIES HAD SWITCHED TO THE OTHER SIDE 
HIS REACTION WAS NOT TO DIG IN HIS HEELS MAKE A FIGHT OF IT 
BUT RATHER TO FLEE AT NIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY DISGUISED AS A PRIEST 
BEWAILING HIS MISFORTUNES AND AS USUAL BLAMING THEM ON EVERYBODY ELSE 
AT SOME POINT IN HIS UNCONTESTED MARCH TOWARDS RICHARD BOLINGBROKE'S AIMS CHANGED 
FROM SIMPLY GETTING HIS LANDS BACK TO OVERTHROWING THE KING 
NOW I CAN SEE MY END SHAKESPEARE HAS RICHARD SAY 
A NEAT LITTLE PIECE OF LANCASTRIAN PROPAGANDA 
WHICH SOLVED THE EMBARRASSING PROBLEM OF A DEPOSITION 
BY MAKING RICHARD SEEM AS THOUGH HE HAD RESIGNED THE CROWN 
RATHER THAN HAVING IT SNATCHED FROM HIS DESPERATE GRIP 
IT TOOK A MONTH OF PAINFUL NEGOTIATIONS 
TO GET RICHARD NOW A PRISONER IN THE TOWER TO GIVE UP THE THRONE 
THREE TIMES THEY ASKED HIM TO SURRENDER THREE TIMES HE REFUSED 
BEFORE FINALLY BOWING TO THE INEVITABLE 
ON THIRTIETH SEPTEMBER A REPORT OF THE KING'S RENUNCIATION WAS READ TO PARLIAMENT 
GATHERED UNDER THE ANGELS OF RICHARD'S MAGNIFICENT ROOF 
THE LORDS WERE ASKED TO ACCLAIM HENRY BOLINGBROKE EARL OF HEREFORD DUKE OF LANCASTER AS KING HENRY THE FOURTH 
WHICH THEY DID TO CRIES OF YES YES YES 
RICHARD THE DIVINE PRINCE NO LONGER WAS SPIRITED AWAY AND IMPRISONED IN PONTEFRACT CASTLE 
MOST LIKELY HE WAS STARVED TO DEATH A HORRIBLE WAY TO END 
IT ENSURED THERE'D BE NO COMPROMISING MARKS OF ASSAULT ON HIS BODY WHEN IT WAS GIVEN A PUBLIC BURIAL 
NOW ODDLY ENOUGH IT WAS HENRY WHO ORCHESTRATED THIS BIG FUNERAL 
A PRE EMPTIVE STRIKE AGAINST ANY CONSPIRATORS 
WHO MIGHT IMAGINE THAT RICHARD COULD BE RESCUED AND RESTORED TO THE THRONE 
IT WAS BOLINGBROKE'S SON HENRY V. WHO HAD THE BODY OF KING RICHARD BURIED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY 
PERHAPS HENRY WANTED TO PUT THE CHARGE OF MURDER AS WELL AS ITS VICTIM TO REST 
HE MUST HAVE HOPED THAT IN HIS REIGN THE WOUNDS OF THE CONTENDING PARTIES MIGHT BE HEALED 
BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE 
DESPITE HIS VICTORY AT AGINCOURT HENRY V. REMAINS A MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEAD AT THIRTY FIVE FROM DYSENTERY 
SO NEITHER HE NOR HIS SON HENRY THE SIXTH COULD PREVENT WHAT THE STEALING OF RICHARD'S CROWN HAD MADE INEVITABLE 
A LONG AND BLOODY WAR BETWEEN THE COMPETING WINGS OF THE PLANTAGENET FAMILY 
FOR THIRTY YEARS THE HOUSES OF YORK AND LANCASTER SLOGGED IT OUT IN A ROLL CALL OF BATTLES 
WE KNOW AS THE WARS OF THE ROSES 
THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS TO FEEL ABOUT THE WARS OF THE ROSES 
EITHER THE ENDLESS CHRONICLE OF VIOLENT SEIZURES OF THE CROWN 
MAKES YOU THRILL TO ONE OF THE GREAT ENGLISH EPICS OR IT LEAVES YOU FEELING SLIGHTLY NUMBED 
IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE DAZED AND CONFUSED 
THE TEMPTATION IS TO WRITE OFF THE WHOLE SORRY MESS AS THE BLOODY BICKERING OF OVERGROWN SCHOOLBOYS 
WHACKING EACH OTHER SENSELESS AT TOWTON BARNET AND BOSWORTH 
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING AT STAKE IN ALL THE MAYHEM 
THE SENSE OF NEEDING TO MAKE THE ENGLISH MONARCHY CREDIBLE AGAIN 
TO RE SOLDER THE CHAINS OF ALLEGIANCE 
WHICH HAD ONCE STRETCHED ALL THE WAY FROM WESTMINSTER OUT TO THE CONSTABLES AND JUSTICES IN THE SHIRES 
AND WHICH HAD BEEN SO BADLY BROKEN BY THE FATE OF RICHARD THE SECOND 
TO UNDERSTAND THE WAY IN WHICH LAWLESSNESS VIOLENCE AND CHAOS 
DID MAKE AN IMPACT ON FIFTEENTH CENTURY ENGLAND 
WE HAVE SOMETHING INCOMPARABLY RICHER THAN THE LIST OF BATTLEFIELDS AND BARONS KINGS AND KING MAKERS 
WE HAVE THE LETTERS OF THE PASTON FAMILY OF NORFOLK THE VERY FIRST PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE IN ENGLISH 
THE AUTHENTIC VOICE OF MIDDLING FOLK 
FARMERS LAWYERS WOULD BE GENTRY SOCIAL CLIMBERS 
LIKE MANY AN ANXIOUS WIFE AND MOTHER THE WARS OF THE ROSES WORRIED MARGARET PASTON 
BECAUSE THEY WERE MAKING ENGLAND A BAD PLACE TO MAKE AND KEEP A LITTLE FORTUNE 
GOD FOR HIS MERCY GIVE GRACE 
FOR I NEVER HEARD SAY OF SO MUCH ROBBERY AND MANSLAUGHTER IN THIS COUNTRY AS IS NOW 
AND AS FOR GATHERING OF MONEY I NEVER SAW A WORSE SEASON 
TO MARGARET THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND MIGHT BE UP FOR GRABS BUT THE REAL DISASTER WAS SHOPPING 
AS FOR CLOTH FOR MY GOWN I PRAY THAT YOU WILL VOUCHSAFE TO DO BUY FOR ME THREE YARDS AND A QUARTER 
OF SUCH AS IT PLEASETH YOU THAT I SHOULD HAVE 
FOR I HAVE DONE ALL THE DRAPER'S SHOPS IN THIS TOWN AND HERE IS RIGHT FEEBLE CHOICE 
THE FOUNDER OF THE PASTON DYNASTY CLEMENT IS DESCRIBED AS A PLAIN HUSBANDMAN 
WHICH IS TO SAY A PEASANT 
BUT A PEASANT WHO TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE BLACK DEATH TO SCRAMBLE RIGHT UP THE SOCIAL LADDER OF THE VILLAGE 
CLEMENT PASTON WAS SHREWD ENOUGH TO SEND HIS SON WILLIAM TO LAW SCHOOL 
CLEVER ENOUGH THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE THROUGH LEARNING AS MUCH AS THROUGH LAND 
THAT THE FORTUNES OF THE PASTONS WOULD BE UTTERLY TRANSFORMED 
CLEMENT'S SON DID INDEED BECOME A LAWYER AND MARRIED INTO MONEY 
SO DID HIS GRANDSON JOHN WHO ACQUIRED CAISTER CASTLE COMPLETING THE METEORIC RISE OF THE PASTONS 
FROM PEASANTRY TO LANDED GENTRY IN JUST TWO GENERATIONS 
JOHN JENNEY INFORMED ME AND I'VE VERILY LEARNED SINCE YOU'RE TO BE MADE A KNIGHT AT THIS CORONATION 
CONSIDERING THE COMFORTABLE TIDINGS AFORESAID TWERE TIME THE NECESSARY GEAR BE PURVEYED FOR 
BUT NOTHING'S EVER THIS EASY IS IT 
AS THE PASTONS BECAME INFLUENTIAL AND RICH SO THEY ALSO WERE BOUND TO ATTRACT ENEMIES 
WHILE THEY WERE NOBODIES THE GREAT BLOODY TIDES OF THE WARS OF THE ROSES WERE GOING TO HAPPEN SOMEWHERE ELSE 
BUT NOW THAT THEY BECAME OWNERS OF LANDS AND MANORS AND CASTLES 
THEY ALSO BECAME PRIME TARGETS FOR THE HEAVIES AND NO ONE WAS HEAVIER THAN THE DUKE OF NORFOLK 
HE'D ALWAYS COVETED CAISTER CASTLE IN SEPTEMBER ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY NINE HE CAME TO GET IT 
MARGARET WROTE IN SOME ANGUISH TO HER SON I GREET YOU WELL 
LETTING YOU KNOW THAT YOUR BROTHER AND HIS FELLOWSHIP STAND IN GREAT JEOPARDY AT CAISTER 
WELL SHE WAS CLEARLY DESPERATE BUT SHE WAS ALSO EXTREMELY ANGRY 
A FEW LINES LATER SHE LETS HER SON JOHN 
FEEL THE ROUGH EDGE OF HER TONGUE WHICH IS EXTREMELY ROUGH INDEED 
EVERY MAN IN THIS COUNTRY MARVELS THAT YOU SUFFER THEM TO BE FOR SO LONG IN GREAT JEOPARDY 
THEY BE LIKE TO LOSE BOTH THEIR LIVES AND THE PLACE 
THE GREATEST REBUKE TO YOU THAT EVER CAME TO ANY GENTLEMAN 
JOHN IMMEDIATELY WRITES BACK 
MOTHER IF I HAD NEED TO BE WOKEN UP BY A LETTER AT THIS TIME I WOULD INDEED BE A SLUGGISH FELLOW 
I HAVE HEARD TEN TIMES WORSE TIDINGS SINCE THE SIEGE BEGAN THAN ANY LETTER THAT YOU WROTE ME 
BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT THOSE WITHIN HAVE NO WORSE REST THAN I HAVE NOR FEAR MORE DANGER 
FACED WITH THE MIGHT OF THE DUKE OF NORFOLK'S ARMY THE PASTONS HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO SURRENDER THEIR CASTLE 
BUT ONCE AGAIN THE LAW WOULD BRING ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATION OF THEIR FORTUNES 
IT TOOK A SEVEN YEAR LEGAL BATTLE AND AN APPEAL TO THE KING 
BUT THEY WERE EVENTUALLY REINSTATED AT CAISTER 
ALTHOUGH FOR THE ELDEST OF MARGARET'S BROOD THE TRIUMPH WAS SHORT LIVED 
THREE YEARS LATER JOHN PASTON DIED OF THE PLAGUE 
THE PASTONS HAD GOT OVER ALL THESE BUMPS IN THE ROAD TO BECOME A SETTLED PRESENCE IN THEIR COUNTY 
THE SAME WOULD BE TRUE FOR COUNTLESS OTHER ENGLISH MEN AND WOMEN 
ESSENTIALLY THEY WERE SURVIVORS 
THEY'D SURVIVED THE PLAGUE THEY'D SURVIVED DETHRONEMENT THEY'D SURVIVED CIVIL WAR 
KINGS CAME AND WENT BUT THE MEN OF THE VILLAGE THE SAME SORT OF MEN WHO'D MARCHED ON LONDON IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE 
WHO'D BEEN REVOLUTIONARIES AND DESPERADOS WERE BECOMING SQUIRES 
THEY KNEW WHAT THE WORST COULD BE THEY KNEW THAT THE PLAGUE COULD COME AND CARRY OFF BABIES AND CHILDREN 
THEY KNEW THAT THE KNIGHTS FROM OVER THE HILL MIGHT GO ON A RAMPAGE 
BUT THEY ALSO KNEW THAT WITH AN EQUAL MEASURE OF PRUDENCE AND PRAYER THEY WOULD GET THROUGH IT 
SO COME TO AN ENGLISH VILLAGE LIKE THIS FAR FROM THE MAYHEM SAY AROUND ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY 
AND YOU'D SEE WHAT YOU'D EXPECT 
A CHURCH BUILT IN THE ECONOMIC ELEGANCE OF THE PERPENDICULAR STYLE 
A VILLAGE ALE HOUSE WITH A NAME LIKE THE SWAN OR THE FROG 
AND AT THE HEART A GRAND AND HANDSOME DWELLING FOR THE BIGGEST TENANT FARMER IN THE AREA 
NOT A WATTLE AND DAUB SINGLE ROOMED GLORIFIED HUT 
BUT A MINIATURE MANOR WITH ITS OWN HALL AND SERVANTS TO WAIT ON THE MASTER AND MISTRESS 
A BUTTERY A CELLAR AND PRIVATE RETIRING CHAMBERS 
ONE SHOULDN'T BE TOO COMPLACENT ABOUT THE CONDITION OF BRITAIN AT THE END OF ITS FIRST CENTURY OF PLAGUE 
THE END OF THE ROAD THROUGH TRAUMA WAS NOT ALL BUTTERCUPS AND BEER 
THERE WAS STILL GRINDING POVERTY ALONGSIDE PLENTY 
BUT ALL THE SAME THE IMPROBABLE HAD HAPPENED 
OUT OF THE FIRES OF PESTILENCE AND BLOODSHED HAD EMERGED THAT MOST UNLIKELY EXAMPLE OF SURVIVOR 
THE ENGLISH COUNTRY GENT 
THERE'S MUCH MORE TO DISCOVER AND DEBATE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF BRITAIN ON THE B. B. C. HISTORY WEBSITE
