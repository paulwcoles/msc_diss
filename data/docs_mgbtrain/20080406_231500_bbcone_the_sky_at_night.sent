GOOD EVENING LATE LAST MONTH 
I OPENED MY DAILY PAPER AND THERE I SAW THAT 
TO SAVE MONEY THERE WAS A THREAT TO CLOSE JODRELL BANK 
OUR GREAT RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY 
WITH THE TWO FIFTY F. T. LOVELL TELESCOPE 
I SIMPLY COULDN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING OF THE KIND COULD BE CONTEMPLATED 
AND WHO BETTER TO GIVE HIS VIEWS 
THAN THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL SIR MARTIN REES 
SO I WENT TO CAMBRIDGE AND THERE I TALKED TO HIM 
MARTIN IT'S GREAT OF YOU TO WELCOME US IN THIS WONDERFUL ROOM BUT JODRELL BANK 
WHY DID THIS OCCUR 
WELL WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT A YEAR AGO 
WAS THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO REORGANISE THE WAY IN WHICH 
THE SO CALLED BIG SCIENCES WERE FUNDED 
THEY MESHED TOGETHER THE AGENCY THAT USED TO LOOK AFTER ASTRONOMY SPACE AND PARTICLE PHYSICS 
WITH ANOTHER AGENCY THAT LOOKED AFTER BIG LABORATORIES ON THE GROUND 
LIKE DARESBURY AND THE DIAMOND LABORATORY NEAR OXFORD 
AND IN SETTING THIS UP IT'S CLEAR THEY DIDN'T CONSIDER ADEQUATELY 
THE PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE EXPENDITURE AND COMMITMENTS 
FOR THAT REASON AND ALSO BECAUSE THERE WAS AN UNNECESSARY UPHEAVAL IN OTHER RESPECTS 
THE INITIAL EFFORTS TO SET PRIORITIES WERE CLEARLY CONTROVERSIAL AND WERE NOT HANDLED OPTIMALLY 
THERE WAS A BAD SITUATION IN NOVEMBER 
WHERE THERE WAS A THREAT THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GET OUT OF GEMINI 
BUT SOME OF THESE THINGS HAVE NOW BEEN SORTED OUT 
AND I HOPE VERY MUCH THAT 
DESPITE THE QUITE UNNECESSARY MUDDLE OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS 
IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO GET A CLEARER SET OF PRIORITIES 
TO CLOSE JODRELL BANK WOULD BE A DAMAGING BLOW TO SCIENCE 
I THINK IT'S CLEAR 
THAT INSTRUMENTS LIKE JODRELL BANK ARE ICONIC 
AND THEY HAVE AN IMPACT 
NOT ONLY ON THE U. K.'S IMAGE ABROAD 
BUT ALSO THE JODRELL TELESCOPE THAT WAS OPENED IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
JUST IN TIME FOR THE FIRST SPUTNIK 
HAS REMAINED STATE OF THE ART FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS IT'S BEEN RESURFACED 
AND IT'S RATHER WONDERFUL I THINK THAT AT THE MOMENT THAT GIANT TELESCOPE 
IS MAKING OBSERVATIONS OF AN AMAZING SYSTEM 
A SO CALLED BINARY NEUTRON STAR TWO NEUTRON STARS 
IN ORBIT AROUND EACH OTHER WITH AN ORBITAL PERIOD OF TWO HOURS 
AND THAT SYSTEM SHOWS THE EFFECT OF EINSTEIN'S THEORY 
IN MUCH GREATER PRECISION THAN ANY OTHER SYSTEM 
AND WITHIN THREE OR FOUR YEARS 
THAT SYSTEM WILL ALLOW THE JODRELL TELESCOPE 
TO TEST EINSTEIN'S THEORY TO A PRECISION OF ONE PART IN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
AND IT'S RATHER WONDERFUL THAT FIFTY YEARS AFTER 
BERNARD LOVELL BUILT THIS VISIONARY PROJECT 
HIS TELESCOPE IS BEING USED TO PROVE EINSTEIN'S THEORY 
WITH A PRECISION FAR HIGHER THAN ANYONE THEN THOUGHT POSSIBLE USING OBJECTS 
NEUTRON STARS AND PULSARS WHICH NO ONE THOUGHT EXISTED FIFTY YEARS AGO 
IT'S WONDERFUL HOW THIS TELESCOPE IS STILL AT THE FRONTIER FIFTY YEARS ON 
IN THE WORST SCENARIO IF IT WERE AXED ON FINANCIAL GROUNDS 
MANY PROGRAMMES HERE AND ELSEWHERE WOULD COLLAPSE 
WELL IF JODRELL BANK WERE NOT TO CONTINUE 
OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD LOSE A GREAT DEAL OF OUR MOMENTUM IN RADIO ASTRONOMY 
WHICH WOULD INDEED BE AN OWN GOAL 
AND YOU'RE CONFIDENT NOW THAT THIS CAN BE AVERTED BECAUSE ASTRONOMY 
IS SUCH A VIBRANT SUBJECT AND WE HAVE SUCH A STRONG COMMUNITY IN THIS COUNTRY 
THERE'S ALWAYS A TUSSLE BETWEEN THE PRIORITIES OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS 
THOSE IN RADIO ASTRONOMY OPTICAL ASTRONOMY AND SPACE ASTRONOMY OF ALL KINDS 
AND UNDERSTANDABLY THERE'S A LOT OF BOISTEROUS DEBATE 
BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE THE PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN SET 
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEES ARE NOW BEING RECONSTITUTED 
AND WILL BE RETHINKING THEIR PRIORITIES 
I'D BE AMAZED IF THE JODRELL BANK PROJECT DIDN'T END UP WITH A RATHER HIGHER PRIORITY NEXT TIME ROUND 
THANK YOU IT'S BEEN GREAT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT JODRELL BANK 
THANK YOU WHILE WE'RE HERE CAN I COME ON TO SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND MUCH MORE REFRESHING 
THE GREAT GAMMA RAY FLARE THAT'S TAKEN PLACE A LONG WAY AWAY 
WELL THIS IS INDEED A REMARKABLE DISCOVERY 
AND IT'S CLOSE TO MY OWN RESEARCH INTEREST GAMMA RAY BURSTS 
GAMMA RAY BURSTS COULD I SAY 
ARE A KIND OF STELLAR EXPLOSION WHICH IS MORE SPECTACULAR THAN A SUPERNOVA 
IN A SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION THE CENTRE OF THE STAR IMPLODES 
AND THE ENERGY THAT'S RELEASED PERCOLATES OUT TO THE SURFACE OVER A FEW DAYS 
AND GIVES THE CHARACTERISTIC LIGHT CURVE 
IN THE CASE OF A GAMMA RAY BURST 
THE STAR IS SPINNING AND THE ENERGY RELEASED IN THE COLLAPSE OF THE CORE OF THE STAR 
SQUIRTS OUT ALONG THE ROTATION AXIS IN A NARROW JET 
AND IF YOU'RE IN THAT JET 
IF YOU'RE IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT'S POINTING 
THEN WHAT YOU'D SEE IS SOMETHING WHICH APPEARS ABOUT A MILLION TIMES BRIGHTER THAN A SUPERNOVA 
AND WHICH LASTS JUST A FEW SECONDS OR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN FADES AWAY 
WHAT HAPPENED WAS 
THE DETECTION OF A GAMMA RAY BURST 
WHICH HAD A MUCH BRIGHTER OPTICAL FLASH ASSOCIATED WITH IT THAN ANY BEFORE 
IT WAS QUITE REMARKABLE THIS GAMMA RAY BURST WAS DETECTED BY THE SWIFT SATELLITE 
AND THE BURST IS ABOUT SEVEN BILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY 
THE LIGHT'S BEEN TRAVELLING TOWARDS US FOR MORE THAN HALF THE TIME SINCE THE BIG BANG 
BUT THE OPTICAL FLASH FROM THIS OBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST VISIBLE FOR THE NAKED EYE 
MAGNITUDE FIFTY FIVE AND THEREFORE 
THIS OBJECT IS NEARLY A MILLION TIMES BRIGHTER THAN AN ENTIRE GALAXY WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THAT DISTANCE 
AND A MILLION TIMES BRIGHTER THAN A SUPERNOVA 
IT IS AN AMAZING CHALLENGE TO US THEORISTS TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND 
HOW SOMETHING AS EXTREME AS THAT CAN EVER OCCUR 
IT'S ALSO REMARKABLE TO THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION OF THAT KIND 
IN OUR OWN GALAXY YES EVEN IF IT WAS AT THE CENTRE OF OUR GALAXY 
TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND LIGHT YEARS AWAY 
THAT OPTICAL FLASH WOULD BE BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN 
SO QUITE AN EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON 
SOMETHING WHICH IS BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN BY SUCH A HUGE FACTOR 
WHAT'S THE LATEST NEWS ABOUT THIS LATEST BURST 
WELL IT FADED AWAY 
BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT ROBOTIC SMALL TELESCOPES WERE ABLE TO POINT TOWARDS IT 
WITHIN TWENTY SECONDS OF THE DETECTION BY THE SWIFT SATELLITE 
AND THEY CAUGHT IT IN ITS VERY BRIGHT PHASE 
THE BRIGHT PHASE LASTED ONLY A MINUTE OR SO 
IT THEN GRADUALLY FADED AWAY 
AND CAN STILL BE DETECTED 
BUT NOW IT'S FADED TO ABOUT EIGHTEENTH MAGNITUDE BUT BIG TELESCOPES 
CAN STILL OF COURSE STUDY IT GET THE REDSHIFT 
AND USE IT TO STUDY THE MATERIAL ALONG THE LINE OF SIGHT 
IT SEEMS THERE ARE NEW DISCOVERERS NEW EVENTS ALMOST EVERY MONTH NOW 
AND THE MORE WE LEARN THE MORE WE REALISE THE MORE WE DON'T KNOW 
IT'S AN UNENDING QUEST AND THAT'S WHAT'S FASCINATING ABOUT THE SUBJECT THEREFORE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY 
ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING AREAS OF ASTRONOMY HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE 
THERE'S ALSO HOPE NOW THAT THE JODRELL BANK HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE 
AND IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS' TIME IT SHOULD BE OPERATING JUST AS IT IS NOW 
I VERY MUCH HOPE SO 
MARTIN THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU 
LET'S TURN NOW TO THE MOST IMPORTANT BODY IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
OUR OWN SUN THAT WE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH FOR SOME TIME 
SO NOW IS A VERY GOOD MOMENT FOR TWO REASONS 
FIRST OF ALL THE SUN IS TO SOME EXTENT A VARIABLE 
THERE IS A WELL DEFINED CYCLE OF SOLAR ACTIVITY 
OF ABOUT ELEVEN YEARS IN LENGTH 
WE'VE JUST COME TO THE END OF ONE CYCLE AND WE ARE STARTING ANOTHER 
FOR THE FIRST ACTIVE AREAS AND THE FIRST SUNSPOTS 
SO IN THE NEXT YEARS WE MAY EXPECT 
MORE ACTIVITY AND MORE THINGS LIKE AURORAE SO A GOOD MOMENT 
SECONDLY THERE ARE TWO INTERESTING PROBES ORBITING THE SUN 
ONE IS ULYSSES NOW COMING TO THE END OF HIS CAREER 
THE OTHER IS STEREO NOW IN FULL FLIGHT 
WITH ME NOW TWO GREAT EXPERTS 
DOCTORS TIM HORBURY AND CHRIS DAVIS 
WELCOME TO THE SKY AT NIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU 
MAY I COME FIRST TO YOU TIM ULYSSES 
YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED ALL THE WAY THROUGH CAN YOU GIVE US A RUN DOWN ON ULYSSES WHAT IT'S DOING 
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO IT NOW 
SURE ULYSSES WAS LAUNCHED IN NINETEEN NINETY 
AND IT'S A SPACECRAFT TO STUDY THE SUN AND IN PARTICULAR 
THE HOT IONISED PLASMA COMING OFF THE SUN CALLED THE SOLAR WIND 
ULYSSES IS IN A POLAR ORBIT SO IT TRAVELS OVER THE POLES OF THE SUN 
THE SOUTH POLE AND THE NORTH POLE 
BECAUSE IT WAS REALISED VERY EARLY ON THAT CONDITIONS ARE GOING TO BE 
DIFFERENT OVER THE POLES OF THE SUN THAN AT LOW LATITUDES 
ULYSSES HAS REALLY SHOWN THAT THAT IS THE CASE 
OF COURSE ULYSSES SADLY IS NOW COMING TO THE END OF ITS CAREER 
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S LASTED OVER SEVENTEEN YEARS NOW 
BUT THE POWER IS GRADUALLY REDUCING IN THE SPACECRAFT AND SO IT'S GETTING VERY COLD 
IN PARTICULAR THE FUEL IS LIKELY TO FREEZE IN THE FUEL LINES 
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE SPACECRAFT WON'T BE ABLE TO POINT ITS ANTENNAE AT THE EARTH 
AND WE'LL LOSE COMMUNICATIONS WITH IT WE DID A PROGRAMME ABOUT IT AND I WAS THERE 
AND I COULD HAVE DONE BUT DIDN'T ACTUALLY TOUCH IT I THOUGHT THAT THING IS MEANT TO BE FAR AWAY 
AND WILL NEVER COME BACK IT'S A GREAT SHAME TO ME THAT I NEVER DID TOUCH IT 
BECAUSE IT LAUNCHED BEFORE I STARTED MY P. H. D. SO I NEVER GOT TO SEE IT 
AND WHAT'S ULYSSES ACTUALLY DONE 
IT'S MEASURED THE SOLAR WIND PROPERTIES AND COSMIC RAYS OVER THE POLES OF THE SUN 
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT NEAR SOLAR MINIMUM WHERE WE ARE NOW WITH VERY FEW SUNSPOTS 
WE KNOW THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD IN THAT CASE IS RATHER SIMPLE LIKE A BAR MAGNET 
IT'S LIKE THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD AS WELL SO IT'S GOT A NORTH AND A SOUTH POLE IN THAT SITUATION 
OVER THE POLES OF THE SUN THERE ARE MAGNETIC FIELD LINES 
WHICH COME OUT EASILY INTO SPACE 
THE HOT ATMOSPHERE OF THE SUN THE CORONA AT A MILLION OR SO DEGREES 
CAN THEN VERY EASILY TRAVEL ALONG THOSE MAGNETIC FIELD LINES AND OUT INTO INTERPLANETARY SPACE 
THAT RESULTS IN A VERY FAST STEADY SOLAR WIND OVER THE POLES OF THE SUN 
AT LOW LATITUDES WHERE WE ARE THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD IS MUCH MORE CLOSED AND MUCH MORE COMPLEX 
AS A RESULT THE SOLAR WIND THAT COMES OUT IS SLOWER AND MORE VARIABLE 
IT'S CERTAINLY DONE MARVELLOUS THINGS NOW ON TO STEREO A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF PROBE 
NOW IN FULL FLOW CHRIS WHAT ABOUT STEREO CAN YOU GIVE US A RUN DOWN ON THAT 
STEREO IS A MISSION THAT WAS LAUNCHED IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SIX 
IT'S A NASA MISSION WHICH IS SENDING TWO SPACECRAFTS OUT 
IN EARTH LIKE ORBITS ONE AHEAD OF THE EARTH AND ONE BEHIND 
THESE TWO SPACECRAFTS LOOK BACK AT THE SUN AND FROM THEIR ADVANTAGE POINTS 
TWO SEPARATE POINTS IN SPACE THEY ARE ABLE TO IMAGE THE SURFACE OF THE SUN IN THREE D. 
THE SURFACE OF THE SUN IS VERY COMPLICATED 
IT'S THREADED WITH ALL KINDS OF MAGNETIC FIELD STRUCTURES 
AND IT'S A FLUID SO THERE'S CONSTANT MOTION OF MATERIAL 
WE'RE INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT WHAT CAUSES THESE SHAPES TO CHANGE 
AND HOW THE MAGNETIC FIELD EVOLVES ON THE SUN IF YOU'VE GOT TWO SPACECRAFTS 
YOU CAN GET A THREE DIMENSIONAL VIEW OF THIS 
AND THAT HELPS YOU WORK OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
SOMETHING MOVING AND SOMETHING CHANGING SHAPE 
IF YOU CAN WORK OUT THE ORIENTATION OF THESE STRUCTURES IT'S WORKING WELL VERY WELL YES 
WE'VE BEEN IN SCIENCE OPERATIONS SINCE LAST APRIL 
AS WELL AS THE SUNWARD POINTING TELESCOPES 
THERE ARE INSTRUMENTS ON BOARD WHICH TASTE THE SOLAR WIND 
THEY CAN MEASURE THE PARTICLES COMING OUT FROM THE SUN 
THE U. K. PROVIDED ONE OF THE PAIRS OF INSTRUMENTS ONE ON EACH OF THE SPACECRAFTS 
KNOWN AS THE HELIOSPHERIC IMAGER AND THIS IS A LIFE SIZE MODEL 
AND IT'S AN AMAZING PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY IT WAS BUILT IN THE U. K. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM 
IT'S MOUNTED ON THE SIDE OF THE SPACECRAFT AND IT POINTS JUST OFF THE SUN 
SO THE SUN IS JUST OUTSIDE THE FIELD OF VIEW 
THEY CAN LOOK BACK BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE EARTH 
AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE SOLAR WIND COMING OUR WAY 
THESE CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS A VERY EXCITING THING 
WHAT IS A C. M. E. 
A C. M. E. IS AN EXPLOSION OF HOT PLASMA WHICH IS AN ELECTRIFIED GAS 
AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE PLASMA BALL BEHIND YOU THERE EACH ONE OF THESE EXPLOSIONS 
CONTAINS ABOUT A BILLION TONNES OF MATERIAL 
TRAVELLING AT A MILLION MILES AN HOUR 
SO THEY'RE VERY VIOLENT PHENOMENA 
WE'RE INTERESTED IN TRACKING WHERE THOSE GO IN SPACE 
IF YOU'VE GOT TWO SPACECRAFTS 
YOU'RE ABLE TO WORK OUT SPEED AND DIRECTION SO FOR THE FIRST TIME 
WE'RE STARTING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ACCURATE SPACE WEATHER FORECASTS 
WE CAN GIVE ADVANCE WARNING OF WHERE THESE CLOUDS ARE GOING 
AND IN WHAT DIRECTION 
WHICH HAS OBVIOUS USES IF WE'RE STARTING TO EXPLORE THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
HAVING MANNED BASES AND A MANNED MISSION TO MARS 
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO KNOW WHERE THESE VIOLENT EXPLOSIONS ARE HEADING 
HOW LONG WILL STEREO LAST STEREO IS DESIGNED TO LAST ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS 
THEY'RE SENDING BACK AMAZING PICTURES THEY ARE 
WE'RE SEEING FANTASTIC IMAGES OF THESE MASS EJECTIONS 
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT CAUSES THEM TO BE TRIGGERED 
AND TO MOVE INTO SPACE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES 
OF HAVING THREE D. IMAGES IS THAT WE CAN NOW 
START TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CAUSES THESE MASS EJECTIONS TO BE LAUNCHED 
AND THE SHAPES WE'RE SEEING THE WAY THEY MOVE AND EVOLVE 
AS THEY COME AWAY FROM THE SUN IS HELPING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 
AS TO WHICH OF THE THEORIES IS RIGHT 
ABOUT THE FORMATION OF THESE MASS EJECTIONS 
WE'RE LEARNING ALL ABOUT THE SUN WITH THESE PROBES 
ALSO WE HAD A GREAT COMET COMET MCNAUGHT 
YES IN FACT IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE SAW 
WHEN WE OPENED THE DOOR OF ONE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS COMET MCNAUGHT 
THIS MAGNIFICENT FEATHERY TAIL WHICH TELLS US A LOT ABOUT THE ELEMENTS IN THE TAIL 
WE'VE ALSO SEEN COMET MACHHOLZ ORBITINGTHE SUN 
WITH A BEAUTIFUL DUST TAIL BUT I THINK THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN 
WAS COMET ENCKE AS IT CAME IN TOWARDS THE SUN 
A MASS EJECTION WENT OFF AND IT RIPPED THE TAIL OFF THIS COMET 
AND HOW COMETS INTERACT WITH THE SOLAR WIND IS A REALLY GRAPHIC EXAMPLE 
OF HOW THE SOLAR WIND CAN AFFECT OBJECTS IN SPACE 
ENCKE IS AN OLD FRIEND IT WASN'T PERMANENTLY DAMAGED NO IT WASN'T BUT YOU COULD SEE THAT 
THIS TAIL ACTUALLY DISCONNECTED AS THE C. M. E. WENT OVER THE TOP OF IT 
WE'VE SEEN THOSE KIND OF DISCONNECTION EVENTS BEFORE 
BUT WE'VE NEVER SEEN A C. M. E. GO OVER THE TOP OF IT TO CAUSE 
THE DISCONNECTION SO THAT'S WHAT'S LOVELY ABOUT THIS 
WITH THESE OBSERVATIONS YOU CAN SEE THESE TAILS CAN SOMETIMES BE QUITE LONG 
WITH ULYSSES WE SAW HOW LONG THEY CAN BE 
IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX ULYSSES PASSED BY CHANCE THROUGH THE TAIL OF COMET HYAKUTAKI 
WHICH WAS VERY BRIGHT A LOVELY COMET IT WAS SPECTACULAR 
ULYSSES PASSED THROUGH THE TAIL ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION KILOMETRES DOWN TAIL 
A HUGE DISTANCE MUCH FURTHER THAN WE ARE FROM THE SUN FOR EXAMPLE 
WITH ULYSSES WE REALISED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THESE COMET TAILS 
CAN ACTUALLY ESSENTIALLY LAST THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR WIND 
AS IT GOES TOWARDS THE TERMINATION SHOCK AROUND ONE HUNDRED TIMES WE ARE FROM THE SUN 
COMET TAILS SEEM TO BE THESE VERY COHERENT OBJECTS 
WHICH PROBABLY ARE SOME OF THE LARGEST IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
THEY STRETCH RIGHT OUT TO THE FAR EDGES OF THE DEPTHS OF SPACE 
WHAT OTHER RESULTS FOR EXAMPLE STARS 
YES WE'VE GOT VERY WIDE FIELD CAMERAS IN SPACE EXACTLY 
WE'RE IN A VERY PRIVILEGED POSITION BECAUSE 
THEY DRIFT THROUGH A FIELD OF VIEW OVER A MATTER OF WEEKS 
WE'RE TAKING IMAGES OF SOMETHING LIKE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND STARS 
DOWN TO ABOUT THIRTEENTH MAGNITUDE 
GLENN WHITE AT THE OPEN UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN WORKING 
TO TRACK THESE STARS AND TO LOOK AT THE LIGHT CURVES 
FOR EACH OF THESE STARS WE CAN SEE ECLIPSING BINARIES 
WE CAN SEE VARIABLE STARS AND THE INTENTION AND THE HOPE IS 
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO START LOOKING FOR EXTRA SOLAR PLANETS WITH THIS 
BEFORE WE BEGAN THIS PROGRAMME 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AMATEUR PARTICIPATION 
YOU HAVE AN AMATEUR WHO WANTS TO BECOME INVOLVED 
HOW DOES HE GO ABOUT IT CHRIS 
AT THE MOMENT WE'VE GOT ALL THE IMAGES AND MOVIES AVAILABLE ONLINE 
ON THE STEREO HI WEBSITE I CAN GIVE YOU THE ADDRESS 
ON THAT WEBSITE YOU'LL SEE ALL THE MOVIES 
AND HOW TO ACCESS THE IMAGES AND THEN 
IF PEOPLE WANT TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND ANYTHING IN THE IMAGES WE HAVEN'T NOTICED 
THEY SHOULD DOWNLOAD THE IMAGES AND LIKE PLANET HUNTERS DID YEARS AGO 
YOU TAKE TWO IMAGES NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND COMPARE REGIONS OF THEM 
IF YOU SEE ANYTHING MOVING THEN IT'S NOT A STAR 
SO IN THOSE IMAGES THERE ARE ASTEROIDS 
AND THE POTENTIAL OF NEAR EARTH OBJECTS AND THOSE TAKE REAL HUNTING OUT 
IT'S EASY ENOUGH IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK 
TO SEE THESE VERY FAINT TRAILS 
THE ADVANTAGE OF STEREO IT'S LOOKING BETWEEN THE SUN AND EARTH 
IT CAN DO THINGS GROUND BASED OBSERVERS CAN'T YES 
THE SUN WOULD BE IN THE FIELD OF VIEW MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE
