THE WORLD FAMOUS TWICKENHAM STADIUM 
HOME AND HEADQUARTERS TO ENGLAND RUGBY UNION 
BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND FOUR THIS PLACE WAS KNOWN AS FORTRESS TWICKENHAM 
BECAUSE ENGLAND HAD AN UNBROKEN WINNING STREAK 
PROVING THE POWER OF THE HOME TURF TO CRUSH ITS OPPONENTS 
LET'S HOPE SOME OF THAT POWER IS IN PLAY TODAY 
BECAUSE OUR SELL OUT CROWD ARE TRYING TO CONVERT THEIR ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES INTO HARD CASH 
AND PRACTISING THEIR PASSES TODAY ARE OUR DREAM TEAM OF EXPERTS 
DAVID PROP FORWARD BARBY WHO DOES COME FROM RUGBY 
AND PHILIP THE LITTLE HOOKER SERRELL 
DAVID AND PHILIP ARE IN SEARCH OF ITEMS WITH A REALLY GOOD CHANCE OF DOING WELL AT THE SALE 
THEY'LL VALUE THEM AND ASK THE OWNERS IF THEY WANT TO FLOG IT 
DAVID IS FIRST TO REACH THE FAMOUS BLUE TABLE 
MARTIN ARE YOU INTO MILITARIA DO YOU COLLECT MILITARIA 
MY FATHER COLLECTS MILITARIA HAS HE GOT A LARGE COLLECTION 
A FAIRLY LARGE COLLECTION YES 
ARE THESE YOURS OR HIS THE TEAPOT'S MINE 
THE TANKARD'S MY FATHER'S THIS IS THE MORE SERIOUS ONE 
THE GERMAN PORCELAIN TANKARD 
THIS WOULD'VE BEEN USED AT CEREMONIAL GET TOGETHERS 
AND IT'S PERSONALISED BECAUSE WE HAVE THE NAME SCHMIDT THE SECOND HERE 
AND ALSO THE REGIMENTAL DETAIL 
ON ONE SIDE ALL THE REGIMENTAL NAMES 
AND THE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES WHY THIS WILL SELL 
IS BECAUSE OF THIS FINIAL HERE 
WHICH SHOWS TWO MILITARY PERSONNEL EITHER SIDE OF THIS GUN 
AND ALL THE WAY ROUND THE TOP HERE WE HAVE MILITARY TROPHIES 
IT IS A PERSONALISED TANKARD AND YOU FIND QUITE A LOT OF THEM AROUND 
TODAY WE'VE HAD AT LEAST THREE BROUGHT IN IN COMPLETE COMPARISON 
THIS IS THE HUMOUR OF THE BRITISH 
TOMMY IN THE TANK THIS BELONGS TO YOU 
IT DOES WHY DOES THIS WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY OF LESSER INTEREST BELONG TO YOU 
THIS WAS GIVEN TO ME BY AN ELDERLY NEIGHBOUR OF MY PARENTS 
BASICALLY TO PLAY WITH IN THE GARDEN 
FORTUNATELY MY PARENTS MANAGED TO INTERCEPT IT BEFORE I GOT TO PLAY WITH IT 
HENCE ITS GOOD CONDITION WEREN'T THERE TEARS WHEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY POSSIBLY 
WELL THIS IS FUN THE ENGLISH LOVE OF TEA 
AND THE ENGLISH LOVE OF THOSE QUIRKY LITTLE OBJECTS 
THIS TEAPOT IS IN THE FORM OF A WWI TANK 
SO I THINK WE CAN DATE THIS TO ROUND ABOUT THE END OF WWI 
COMING INTO THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
UNDERNEATH WE SHOULD FIND THE MARK 
WHICH IS SADLER MADE IN ENGLAND 
SADLER ALSO MADE THOSE PECULIAR TEAPOTS CALLED TEA FOR TWO 
WHICH IS THE RACING CAR O. K. YES 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL THESE 
WELL THIS ONE IS SAT IN THE CUPBOARD AT THE MOMENT 
AND THIS TEAPOT MY PARENTS HAVE NOWHERE FOR IT TO GO NOW 
APART FROM BACK INTO A CUPBOARD SO IT'S TIME TO PUT THEM TO A GOOD HOME 
IF YOU DON'T USE THEM FLOG THEM THAT'S CORRECT YES 
THERE'S NO REGRETS ON THIS MAGNIFICENT PIECE HERE NO 
WHEN PUTTING A PRICE ON THIS ONE I HAVE RESERVATIONS 
BECAUSE THERE IS A FINE STAR CRACK ON THE BOTTOM 
SO A PRICE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN FROM ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE IT DOWN I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
O. K. THE TEAPOT 
THERE ARE COLLECTORS OF TEAPOTS 
THERE ARE COLLECTORS OF ANYTHING TO DO WITH WWI 
IN PARTICULAR BRUCE BAIRNSFATHER 
AND THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO HIS TOMMY 
I THINK THIS WILL DO SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED O. K. I SUGGEST THEY GO UP TOGETHER FOR SALE 
THE AUCTION HOUSE MAY JUST SAY NO THAT'S A TANKARD THIS IS A TEAPOT 
WE'LL SELL THEM SEPARATELY WOULD YOU OBJECT NOT AT ALL 
SO THEY MAY SEPARATE THEM BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE MILITARY RELATED I'D PUT THEM IN AS ONE LOT 
THAT'S FINE YOU'LL BE AT THE AUCTION I WILL SO WILL I 
WHAT TIME DID YOU GET HERE THIS MORNING 
ABOUT QUARTER PAST SEVEN QUARTER PAST SEVEN YES 
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED PATIENCE TO COME TO FLOG IT 
THIS IS LOVELY TELL ME ABOUT IT IT BELONGED TO MY GRANDAD 
WHO PASSED AWAY ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO 
THIS WAS IN THE HOUSE AND I SAID CAN I HAVE THAT TO MY DAD 
DON'T YOU THINK THE WRATH OF YOUR FOREFATHERS IS GOING TO COME DOWN ON YOU WHEN YOU FLOG THIS NOT REALLY 
I TOLD MY DAD AND I DON'T THINK HE REMEMBERED IT 
I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY LOVELY 
IT'S CROCODILE SKIN PATIENCE WRITTEN ACROSS THE FRONT 
SO THAT TELLS US IT'S A CARD GAME HERE'S ONE PACK OF CARDS 
AND INSIDE WE'VE GOT THE OTHER PACK OF CARDS 
WHAT I THINK IS REALLY SWEET CROCODILE SKIN HERE 
THIS IS HALLMARKED SILVER 
AND WE'VE GOT HEARTS CLUBS DIAMONDS AND SPADES IN THE CORNER 
HERE'S THE HALLMARK 
THE LEOPARD'S HEAD FOR LONDON 
THEN THE LITTLE LETTER G. TELLS US THIS WAS ASSAYED IN NINETEEN OH TWO 
THIS IS A REAL GOOD QUALITY ITEM 
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH QUALITY TO BE MAPPIN AND AMP WEBB OR THAT STANDARD OF RETAILER 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL THAT IT'S BEEN SITTING IN A BAG IN THE WARDROBE 
JUST DOING NOTHING AND I WANTED TO COME ALONG TO FLOG IT ANYWAY 
GOOD MAN I ALWAYS WATCH FLOG IT YOU'VE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD 
IT'S SUPER QUALITY WHAT THE HELL DO YOU DO WITH IT UNLESS YOU'RE AN AVID PATIENCE PLAYER 
OR YOU CAN SIT IT ON A LITTLE TABLE AT HOME 
BUT THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH THAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT 
I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE WORTH A FORTUNE WE CAN ESTIMATE IT AT FIFTY TO EIGHTY 
AND WE'LL PUT A RESERVE ON IT OF FIFTY 
IF YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY A COUPLE OF COLLECTORS IN THE SALEROOM 
THAT COULD MAKE ONE HUNDRED PLUS BUT LET'S ESTIMATE IT AT FIFTY TO EIGHTY HAPPY 
I AM I THOUGHT THIRTY TO FORTY SO I'M QUITE HAPPY WITH THAT 
THAT'S A RESULT IF I'VE GOT IT RIGHT NO GUARANTEE YEAH 
ROD YOU MUST HAVE BROUGHT THIS ALONG WITH GREAT CARE 
WELL YES BECAUSE BEING CERAMIC ABSOLUTELY 
THIS IS A CERAMIC PLAQUE WHICH IS QUITE INTRIGUING ACTUALLY 
WHERE DID IT COME FROM FROM MY STEPFATHER'S MOTHER'S HOUSE 
ANY HISTORY WHERE DID THEY GET IT FROM I'VE NO IDEA 
I'VE ASKED MY MUM SHE'S STILL ALIVE 
AND SHE HAS NO IDEA HOW THEY CAME BY IT 
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN IN THE FAMILY OH ONE HUNDRED YEARS THAT'S GOOD 
THEY PROBABLY BOUGHT IT VERY CLOSE TO THE PERIOD IT WAS MANUFACTURED 
THIS IS A CERAMIC PLAQUE MADE BY GOUDA A FACTORY IN SOUTH HOLLAND 
THE ACTUAL SCENE THIS RIVER OR WATERWAY 
HAS GOT NEAR WEST OPPENOURT 
IN THE BACKGROUND WE'VE GOT BRIDGES VARIOUS CHURCH SPIRES 
WAREHOUSES ALONG HERE SO AT ONE TIME IT WAS A VERY BUSY PORT 
HERE WE HAVE AN INTERESTING PIECE 
I THINK INTENDED MAINLY FOR THE WEALTHY TOURIST MARKET 
OH RIGHT DOES THAT FILL IN WITH YOUR WELL IT COULD DO YES 
WERE THEY PARTICULARLY WEALTHY NOT THAT I KNOW OF 
IT NEVER CAME MY WAY PUT IT THAT WAY 
RIGHT THIS WOULD'VE BEEN BOUGHT BY A WELL TO DO FAMILY 
WHO'D HAVE HOLIDAYED IN HOLLAND 
WHY ON EARTH ARE YOU SELLING IT I'VE NOWHERE TO HANG IT 
AND MY MUM HAS NOWHERE THAT SHE WANTS TO HANG IT 
AND I'D RATHER GET THE MONEY AND HELP MY MUM IN HER OLDER AGE 
THAT'S A NICE SENTIMENT AND IF YOU'RE NOT PARTICULARLY FOND OF IT 
SENTIMENTALLY OR ARTISTICALLY THEN BUY SOMETHING ELSE WITH THE MONEY 
YES I WANT TO TURN IT ROUND SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THE BACK 
TO SEE WHETHER IT'S BEEN BOARDED OR YOU'VE GOT THE ACTUAL CERAMIC 
AH THIS IS QUITE GOOD 
HERE WE HAVE THE MARK FOR GOUDA A LITTLE HOUSE OR WINDMILL 
ZUID HOLLAND SOUTH HOLLAND AND THE MANUFACTURER'S MARK 
THIS WOULD DATE IT TO ROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FIVE NINETEEN HUNDRED PERIOD 
YES ALSO 
THIS IS WELL CONSTRUCTED 
THE FRAME ITSELF WITH THESE SECTIONS TO RETAIN 
EVERYTHING'S ABSOLUTELY ORIGINAL AND IT'S NEVER BEEN OUT NO 
IT'S BEEN IN THIS STATE ALL ALONG 
A RATHER NICE PIECE OF FAMILY HISTORY NOBODY ELSE IN THE FAMILY WANTS IT 
NO I WISH I WAS A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY I'D HAVE IT 
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT PRICE 
IF IT GOES UP FOR AUCTION 
I CAN SEE SOMEBODY PAYING THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED AS MUCH AS THAT 
YES I HOPE SO OH I HOPE SO BECAUSE IT IS HAND PAINTED 
IT IS UNIQUE THERE'S NOT ANOTHER ONE LIKE THIS NO 
PAINTED BY A COMPETENT ARTIST YES 
SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO SELL QUITE WELL 
THE AUCTIONEER MAY SUGGEST PUTTING A RESERVE OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED 
WOULD THAT BE AGREEABLE YES THAT'D BE FINE 
I WISH I COULD BUY IT BUT I CAN'T 
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT ALONG THANK YOU 
THIS IS REALLY NICE JOYCE IT IS HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD IT I'VE HAD IT TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
MY MOTHER PASSED IT ON TO ME 
BUT BEFORE I KNEW ABOUT WEMYSS I USED IT AS A POTHOLDER A POTHOLDER YES 
THE MOST EXPENSIVE POTHOLDER IN THE WORLD MM 
DO YOU KNOW WHY IT'S GOT THREE HANDLES NO IT'S A LOVING CUP 
IT'S FULL OF GROG I HOLD IT PASS IT TO YOU AND IT GOES ON TO THE NEXT PERSON OH RIGHT 
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST FOR TWO PEOPLE LOVING CUP NO 
YOU CAN HAVE TWO HANDLED ONES 
BUT THAT'S THE ORIGINATION OF THE THREE HANDLES 
THAT'S GOOD YOU'VE GIVEN THE GAME AWAY AS TO WHAT IT IS WEMYSS 
YES AND IF WE JUST TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN 
WE CAN SEE THE WEMYSS MARK JUST THERE 
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY SOMETHING NOW JOYCE 
I WAS GOING TO SAY WHY IS IT IMPRESSED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE POT 
YOU USUALLY SEE THEM PAINTED IN GREEN OR BLACK 
THEY WERE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY MARKS 
IF I TELL YOU ACTUALLY WHILE WE'VE GOT THIS UPSIDE DOWN 
THERE'S A LITTLE CRACK ON THE BOTTOM 
THAT'S NOT GOOD YES I CAN HEAR IT NOW YES 
IF WE LOOK IN THE INSIDE YOU CAN SEE SOME CRAZING 
YES CRACKING IN THERE YES 
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE WEMYSS 
ROBERT HERON LIVED IN KIRKCALDY IN SCOTLAND 
AND IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO HE INHERITED HIS FATHER'S BUSINESS MAKING POTS 
AND HE TOOK INTO BUSINESS A BOHEMIAN CALLED NEKOLA 
AND THEY SET UP IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THE WEMYSS FACTORY BASED AT KIRKCALDY 
AND THEY PAINTED OR DECORATED WARES LIKE THIS 
THIS IS A TYPICAL WEMYSS POT IN THE STYLE OF DECORATION OF THE ROSES 
THIS IS FROM THAT IMPRESSED MARK LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
I LOVE IT IT IS LOVELY 
DO YOU KNOW WHO ONE OF THE BIGGEST COLLECTORS OF WEMYSS WARE WAS THE QUEEN MOTHER YES 
IF THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT IT WOULD MAKE WELL OVER ONE THOUSAND 
AND IT STILL MIGHT 
YES BUT I THINK WE NEED TO PUT A CAUTIOUS ESTIMATE ON IT 
BECAUSE OF THAT CRACK CRACK 
SO I WOULD PUT FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED 
RIGHT AND I THINK IT COULD JUST TOP THE ONE THOUSAND MARK 
THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE IT WAS A DEAR OLD POTHOLDER WASN'T IT 
YES IT'S LOVELY IT IS WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL IT 
WELL I'M NOT GOING TO PASS IT ON TO ANYBODY DO YOU NOT ENJOY IT NOW 
YES BUT I COULD ALSO DO WITH THE MONEY 
IF IT MAKES SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY WHAT'S IT GONNA GO ON 
I'M GOING TO WASTE IT EXCELLENT STUFF YOU SOUND LIKE MY SORT OF GIRL JOYCE I'LL JUST SPEND IT 
WHAT ON I DON'T KNOW BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE I'M GOING TO SAVE IT AND DO ANYTHING SENSIBLE WITH IT 
I THINK YOU WON'T TELL US 
MAYBE I DON'T KNOW 
WE'LL MOVE SWIFTLY ON THEN YES 
LET'S GET THIS TO THE AUCTION AND GET IT SOLD YES

DON'T TRY IT IN THE SAME SALEROOM NO FOR AT LEAST A YEAR 
ANOTHER AREA YES BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE KNOW SOME ITEMS DO THE ROUNDS 
AND IT GETS A BAD KARMA ABOUT IT YES 
IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT 
IF YOU DON'T REACH YOUR RESERVE IT'S A GOOD IDEA NOT TO PUT YOUR ITEM STRAIGHT INTO THE NEXT SALE 
IN THE SAME SALEROOM THE TRADE WILL SPOT IT A MILE OFF 
AND ASSUME THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE PASSED ON IT ALREADY 
HUNT OUT ANOTHER SALEROOM OR TRY AGAIN A LOT LATER 
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU WEMYSS LOVERS I KNOW THERE'S PLENTY OF YOU OUT THERE

YOU REALLY WANT TWO COLLECTORS THAT'S WHAT GETS YOU PREMIUM VALUE 
IN ANY CASE THE PLACE TO SELL A WEMYSS POT IS UP IN SCOTLAND 
WELL YOU KNOW OR IN A SPECIALIST SALE YES A CERAMIC SALE WHERE THE ELITE WILL FIND IT 
NO IN A WAY I DISAGREE 
IF YOU PUT IT IN A SALE CATALOGUE AND YOUR WEMYSS POT WAS ON THE FRONT COVER 
IT'S ON THE INTERNET AND TODAY THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO 
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO SELL IT IN SCOTLAND BUT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOUR COLLECTORS ARE THERE YES 
NEVER MIND AT LEAST I'VE GOT SOME MONEY TO PAY MY BILL 
OH IT'S RECOUPED THE CAR COSTS HASN'T IT YES 
WELL A MIXED SET OF RESULTS FROM THE SALE SO FAR 
THERE'S PLENTY MORE TO COME BUT NOW I'M OFF TO GET MY HANDS DIRTY 
NOW THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO 
TAKE PART IN AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG IT'S SO EXCITING 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'LL REVEAL FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS 
ARCHAEOLOGY STUDENTS HAVE TAKEN PART IN A MIDSUMMER'S DIG 
HERE OUTSIDE SYON HOUSE THIS LASTS FOR FIVE WEEKS 
THEY'RE HOPING TO REVEAL THE REMAINS OF THE MEDIEVAL ABBEY 
WHICH LAY ON THIS SITE SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
UNDER ROYAL PATRONAGE THE ABBEY GREW QUICKLY 
AND BY THE TIME OF HENRY THE EIGHTH'S DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERIES IN THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTIES 
SYON ABBEY WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE LAND 
IN CHARGE OF THIS SUMMER'S DIG IS HARVEY SHELDON 
HARVEY HELLO I KNOW YOU'RE HARD AT WORK SORRY TO DISTURB YOU 
HOPE YOU'RE NOT DIGGING YOUR OWN GRAVE NOT YET 
WHAT HAVE YOU DISCOVERED ABOUT THE ABBEY SO FAR 
WELL IT'S A VERY EXTENSIVE ABBEY 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A VERY LARGE ABBEY CHURCH 
WHICH WAS FIRST FOUND THREE YEARS AGO 
UNDERLYING THE LAWN OVER HERE 
AND POSSIBLY RUNNING UNDER WHAT BECAME SYON HOUSE 
WHY THREE YEARS AGO WHY WASN'T THIS PROJECT STARTED EARLIER 
WAS IT ONLY DISCOVERED THREE YEARS AGO THE ABBEY WAS KNOWN TO PRE DATE SYON HOUSE 
WHAT WASN'T KNOWN WAS EXACTLY WHERE IT LAY 
WE'RE HERE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE CHURCH 
AND TO LOOK AT THE EXTENSIVE MONASTIC COMPLEX WHICH LIES TO THE SOUTH AND NORTH OF IT 
I GUESS A LOT OF THE WALLS HAVE BEEN ROBBED BY THE GEORGIANS 
THE WALLS COULD'VE BEEN ROBBED AT ANY TIME SINCE THE MID SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND DATING MATERIAL TO TELL US WHEN THAT HAPPENED 
CAN WE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE DIG SURE 
I'LL HAVE TO USE MY IMAGINATION BUT YOU CAN KIND OF TALK ME THROUGH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE WALLS O. K. 
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT HERE 
THE BASE OF ONE OF THE MONASTIC BUILDINGS 
WHICH APPEARS TO BE TIED IN TO THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE CLOISTERS 
SO THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE MAJOR STRUCTURES 
WHAT'S BEEN LEFT HERE ARE THE STONE FOUNDATIONS WHICH ARE PRETTY DEEP 
AND THE BOTTOM COURSES OF THE BRICKS 
IT'S BEEN ROBBED DOWN BENEATH FLOOR LEVEL IT IS VERY WIDE 
WHAT'S THIS SECTION HERE WE'VE GOT A RIGHT ANGLE HERE 
YES THIS LOOKS TO BE THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE CLOISTERS RIGHT 
COMING THROUGH HERE AND ACROSS THERE 
THEN YOU WOULD HAVE IN FRONT OF US HERE 
THIS IS PROBABLY THE CLOISTER PASSAGE COMING DOWN ON THE EASTERN SIDE 
AND THEN TURNING ALONG HERE 
AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE CORNER OF THE EASTERN WALL 
SO WE MIGHT BE IN ONE OF THE CLOISTER PASSAGES WHY IS THAT SO LOW 
THAT'S WHEN WE RUN INTO PROBLEMS CAUSED BY ACTIVITY IN LATER PERIODS 
YOU CAN SEE A BIT OF THE WALL AND ANOTHER BIT DOWN HERE 
WE SEEM TO HAVE A LARGE CUT FOR A FEATURE THAT RELATED TO THE FORMAL GARDENS OF SYON HOUSE 
IT'S A LOT OF HARD WORK HARVEY 
CAN WE HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE SMALL ARTEFACTS YOU'VE FOUND SO FAR 
SURE COME ON THEN 
GOSH THERE'S LOTS IN THIS TRAY 
THAT LOOKS NICE IT'S BEEN WORKED IT'S BEEN FASHIONED 
IS THAT THE SURROUND OF A WINDOW 
YES IT'S PROBABLY PART OF A WINDOW 
IT COMES FROM THE NORTHERN TRENCH 
WHERE WE'RE DEALING WITH FINDS THAT RELATE TO THE DEMOLITION OF THE ABBEY 
PROBABLY IN THE LATER SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
YEAH YEAH AND WHAT'S THAT 
THAT'S A BIT OF WINDOW GLASS 
AH DIFFICULT TO SEE IT 
MEDIEVAL GLASS DOESN'T SURVIVE TERRIBLY WELL 
BUT THAT'S AS YOU SEE A NICE FLAT GLASS 
THAT WOULD COME FROM THE WINDOWPANE AND WHAT'S NICE IS 
YOU'VE DRAWN THAT TO ITS EXACT SIZE AND TAKEN ALL ITS DATA 
AND THIS WILL BE LOGGED AND STORED STUDENTS AND STAFF WILL WORK ON THE FINDS 
AS WELL AS UNDERTAKING ALL THE RECORDS ON THE EXCAVATION 
THEN THIS WILL GO INTO WHAT'S CALLED A POST EXCAVATION STAGE 
WHERE IT WILL BE ASSESSED WHERE DO YOU KEEP THE ARTEFACTS 
WE DO THIS EXCAVATION WITH THE MUSEUM OF LONDON SO THEY WILL GO TO THE MUSEUM OF LONDON 
WHAT'S THIS A LITTLE PIN OR NAIL A PIN 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BURIALS ON THE SITE 
DISTURBED THROUGH THE DEMOLITION OF THE ABBEY AND THE GARDENING 
SOMETIMES WE GET THINGS LIKE FINGER RINGS AND SOMETIMES THESE PINS 
WHICH ARE PROBABLY TO HOLD TOGETHER A SHROUD 
LOVELY 
AND HERE WHAT FLOOR TILES YES ALL THE FLOORS HAVE GONE 
THEY'VE BEEN ROBBED AWAY 
BUT THIS MAY BE FROM THE LOW COUNTRY GLAZED FLOOR TILES 
PROBABLY FROM THE ABBEY CHURCH 
LOTS OF IMPORTANT FINDS TURNING UP ALL THE TIME 
WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS DIG 
IT'S AN IMPORTANT ABBEY 
IT'S THE ONLY BRIDGETTINE FOUNDATION KNOWN IN THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD IN ENGLAND IT'S ON ROYAL LAND 
FOUNDED BY HENRY V. IN THE YEAR OF AGINCOURT 
RELOCATED ON THIS SITE BY HIS INFANT SON HENRY THE SIXTH 
AND IT SURVIVES UNTIL THE DISSOLUTIONS OF HENRY THE EIGHTH IN THE LATE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTIES 
THAT'S SOME HISTORY YES THAT'S GOT PROVENANCE 
IT'S A MAJOR ROYAL SITE 
THIS IS THREE YEARS' WORK LET'S HOPE IT GOES ON FOR MANY MORE YEARS 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND 
LORRAINE THIS IS QUITE AN UNUSUAL OBJECT FOR A LADY TO POSSESS 
WHERE DID YOU GET IT IT'S MY MOTHER'S 
I'VE BROUGHT IT IN TODAY FOR HER 
SHE GOT IT FROM MY GRANDFATHER 
WHO WAS IN THE HONG KONG POLICE FORCE 
OH WE THINK THAT'S WHERE IT CAME FROM 
I WONDER IF IT WAS CONFISCATED 
POSSIBLY IT'S QUITE INTRIGUING 
ALL WILL BE REVEALED 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT IS IT'S JAPANESE DATE WISE IT'S 
WHAT I'D TERM MEIJI PERIOD 
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY THAT SORT OF PERIOD 
IT'S CALLED AN INRO 
THIS WAS INITIALLY FOR A JAPANESE GENTLEMAN 
OF QUALITY OF SOME STANDING 
TO PUT HIS PERSONAL ITEMS IN THESE SECTIONS 
WHICH ARE ALL INTERLINKED BY THIS SILK CORD 
EACH COMPARTMENT WOULD'VE CONTAINED THINGS LIKE SNUFF 
OR OTHER OBJECTS HE WOULD NEED IN HIS TRAVELS ROUND TOWN 
RIGHT AND TO SECURE ALL THESE LITTLE COMPARTMENTS 
WAS THIS IVORY BEAD WHICH WOULD SLIDE UP AND DOWN 
THAT'S BEAUTIFULLY CARVED 
IN THE FORM OF A JACKAL WITH A HUMAN SKULL 
AT THE FAR END WE HAVE THIS LITTLE CARVED RED LACQUER 
WHICH IS CALLED A NETSUKE YES 
THE MAIN INGREDIENT IS THIS PIECE HERE THE INRO 
IT DOESN'T CONTAIN PERSONAL ITEMS THAT YOU WOULD NEED DURING A DAY TO DAY EXISTENCE 
BUT THESE ARE RATHER EROTIC ELEMENTS THAT YOU'D EXPECT TO FIND LET'S SAY FROM LADIES OF THE NIGHT 
RIGHT WAS IT EVER EXPLAINED TO YOU AS A YOUNGSTER 
NO IT'S ONLY JUST RECENTLY TURNED UP 
OH RIGHT WAS IT FOUND IN THE BACK OF A DRAWER MY MUM HAD IT IN HER KNITTING BOX 
WHEN SHE WAS IN HOSPITAL WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING AND ONE OF THE CHILDREN FOUND IT 
AND SAID OH LOOK MUM WHAT'S THIS 
I'M GOING TO OPEN A FEW OF THESE COMPARTMENTS 
IN EACH ONE IT SHOWS A COUPLE IN THE FORM OF AN EMBRACE 
YES AND OTHERS AS WE GO DOWN THE BOXES IN GREATER ELEMENTS OF EMBRACE 
BUT THEY ARE ALL BEAUTIFULLY CARVED IN IVORY AND THEN HAND PAINTED 
INTRIGUING DELIGHTFUL QUITE VALUABLE 
BECAUSE ITEMS OF THIS SORT OF EROTIC NATURE DO COMMAND HIGH PRICES 
I THINK AT AUCTION HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE 
I'VE GOT NO IDEA I WOULDN'T EVEN LIKE TO GUESS 
I'M GOING TO SORT OF 
HAZARD A GUESS AT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED OH MY GOODNESS REALLY 
THAT SORT OF PRICE RANGE STILL WANT TO SELL IT 
YES PLEASE RIGHT WHY IS YOUR MUM SELLING IT 
JUST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY SUCH A LONG TIME NOW AND 
IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO PASS IT DOWN TO ONE OR THE OTHER OF HER CHILDREN 
SO THE BEST THING TO DO IS SELL IT NOW AND SHE CAN SEE WHAT BECOMES OF IT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
FRANK IS THIS YOURS 
NO IT'S MY MOTHER'S ACTUALLY 
SO THIS IS YOUR MUM'S 
YOU INHERITED IT INDEED 
AND NOW IT'S GOTTA GO 
YES MY TWO BOYS WOULD NOT APPRECIATE IT SOMEHOW 
DO YOU KNOW THIS I WOULD GUESS DATES TO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ABOUT NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE AND NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE 
YEAH ABSOLUTELY 
AND THE THING IS YOU KNOW THAT AGE WAS THE AGE

NO IT'S IVORY AND HORN AND IT REALLY IS THE MOST EXQUISITE EMBROIDERY BOX 
THAT I'VE SEEN IT'S SORT OF A COLONIAL REGENCY PIECE 
YES IT'S EARLY EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY DIVINE LOOK AT THE SHAPE 
I KNOW THE WORK INVOLVED AND YOU'VE GOT THE ORIGINAL KEY 
WHICH IS GOOD 
WITH A BIT OF RIBBON SO YOU WON'T MISPLACE IT 
IT IS STRIKING IT IS SO DECORATIVE AS WELL 
BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE COMING OUT FROM THE CENTRE FINIAL 
SHALL WE SEE IF IT'S AS GOOD ON THE INSIDE AS IT IS ON THE OUTSIDE 
OPENING UP NOW 
THAT WEIGHS A LOT AS WELL IT'S VERY HEAVY 
I'D IMAGINE THE WHOLE BOX WE'LL HAVE A FEEL OF THAT IN A MINUTE 
LOOK THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT'S GONE INTO IT THEY'D NOT DO THAT NOW NO 
LOOK AT THE LITTLE BUN FEET AS WELL 
SEPARATE COMPARTMENTS FOR COTTON REELS 
PIN CUSHIONS 
OBVIOUSLY LITTLE SECTIONS HERE FOR BUTTONS AND THINGS 
SEQUINS AND YOU NEVER EVER USED THIS 
NO SO YOU DON'T SEW THEN 
OH I DO BUT I DIDN'T USE THAT

GOOD RESULT VERY GOOD RESULT I'VE TOLD HER AUCTIONEERS ESTIMATE FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED

THE RESERVE'S A SORT OF DEAD CERT RESERVE IF YOU LIKE 
THAT WILL DEFINITELY SELL FOR SIX HUNDRED PLUS AND HOPEFULLY 
IT'LL MAKE OVER THE THOUSAND I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS 
YOU COULD GET TWO THOUSAND FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THOSE WERE THE DAYS 
BUT THE NICELY FITTED INTERIORS THIS ISN'T FANTASTIC 
ONE WITH MORE COMPARTMENTS WOULD MAKE TWO THOUSAND 
ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EVEN TODAY BUT THIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT BEHIND THAT 
BUT SIX HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED EASILY 
OR IT COULD BE A GOOD TRADE BUY 
IT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF T. L. C. BUT THERE'S MONEY TO MOVE THAT ON
