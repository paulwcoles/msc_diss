GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO ONE 
OF THE GREAT SPORTING STAGES 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THIS IS 
AINTREE ON THE NORTHERN OUTSKIRTS 
OF LIVERPOOL AND WE ARE EXPECTING A 
HUGE CROWD HERE IT WILL BUILD UP 
THROUGHOUT THE AFTER NON AND THEY 
WILL BE PACKING INTO THE 
GRANDSTANDS AND SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL 
WATCH THE MOST HISTORIC AND 
UNPREDICTABLE AND BEST RACE 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD M. HERE WE ARE 
ONE OF THE GREAT DAYS OF THE RACING 
YEAR GRAND NATIONAL DAY THERE IS 
A REAL ANTICIPATION AHEAD OF THE 
RACE THIS IS THE BIG DAY OF THE 
RACING YEAR WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS 
RACE THAT HOLDS EVERYONE EN 
THRALLED WHETHER THEY LIKE RACING 
OR NOT EVERYONE PAYS ATTENTION TO 
THE RACE AND UP AND DOWN THE 
COUNTRY EVERYONE KNOWS THE JUMPS 
BECHER'S BROOK THE CHAIR THE 
CANAL TURN ANYONE HAS A VIEW AND 
EVERYONE HAS A METHOD YOU CAN PICK 
A TRAINER THAT YOU LIKE A JOCKEY 
YOU'VE HEARD OF OR JUST GO FOR 
YOUR FAVOURITE COLOUR AND IF YOU 
HAVE PULLED OUT A NAME IN THE 
OFFICE SWEEP STAKE YOU WANT TO KNOW 
THE ANSWER 
I'M JUST LIKE EVERYBODY 
ELSE YOU READ THE FORM DISREGARD 
IT AND THEN PICK AN IRISH HORSE 
MY FIRST MEMORY IS ONE OF RED RUM'S 
TRIUMPHS NOT BECAUSE I WAS 
CHEERING RED RUM ON THAT DAY BUT 
THE HORSE THAT HE OVERTOOK DOWN THE 
STRETCH STRETCH ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE I HEARD THE NEWS THAT A HORSE 
CALLED BATTLESHIP HAD WON THE GRAND 
NATIONAL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM 
WHERE ARE YOUR FRIENDS TONIGHT 
WHERE ARE YOUR FRIENDS TONIGHT 
WELL I'M DELIGHTED TO SAY THAT OUR 
BIG NAME ADDITION TO THE TEAM THIS 
YEAR IS RICHARD DUNWOODY THE 
THREE TIMES CHAMPION JOCKEY FOR 
WHOM THE LAST THREE DECADES HAVE 
HELD VERY DIFFERENT CHALLENGES IT 
WAS BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THAT HE WON THE 
GRAND NATIONAL ON TWO YEAR OLD 
WEST TIP AND EARLIER THIS YEAR HE 
THOUGHT YOU KNOW THE GRAND 
NATIONAL THAT'S FOR WIMPS I'M 
GOING TO TREK TO THE SOUTH POLE AND 
OVER FORTY EIGHT DAYS YOU LOST THREE AND A 
HALF STONE THE MOST EFFECTIVE DIET 
EVER 
IT CERTAINLY WAS AND IT WAS EVER THE HARDEST WORK EVER IN MY LIFE 
IT WAS A COLD TWO DAYS THE YEAR I 
WON THE GRAND NATIONAL AND THERE 
WAS SNOW ON THE DAY OF THE RACE ON 
BOTH OCCASIONS IT WAS A LUCKY OMEN 
FOR ME 
I THINK THIS DOES LOOK 
SMALLER DOESN'T IT 
IT IS POSSIBLY 
A LITTLE SMALLER THIS YEAR BUT IT 
STILL HAS A HUGE DITCH IN FRONT OF 
IT AND IT IS ALSO THE MOST NARROW 
FENCE ON THE HORSE AND IF THERE 
WILL STILL BE A LOT OF HORSES IN 
THE RACE AT THIS STAGE THEY COULD 
EASILY GET IN FRONT OF YOU AND 
LOOSE HORSES AS WELL 
AND WOULD YOU 
ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU WALK THE 
COURSE BEFORE 
ALWAYS WALK THE 
COURSE MOST IMPORTANT I'D 
PROBABLY WALK IT TWO OR THREE TIMES 
DURING THE WEEK 
WHAT IS YOUR FANCY 
FOR THE RACE THIS YEAR 
MY FANCY IS 
I DID LOOK AT SIMON BUT THE FIRST 
HORSE I SAW OUT ON THE COURSE THIS 
MORNING AND TOM MULLINS WAS BULLISH 
ABOUT IT I'M GOING FOR CHELSEA 
HARBOUR 
WHAT AN AFTERNOON OF SPORT HARBOUR WE HAVE IN PROSPECT IT IS ALMOST 
IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTAIN OUR 
CHILDHOODISH LIKE EXCITEMENT AND 
WE'VE COME DOWN TO THE STATUE OF 
RED RUM ARGUABLY THE GREATEST 
GRAND NATIONAL HORSE IN HISTORY HE 
WON IT THREE TIMES AND THERE IS A 
SENSE OF HISTORY ABOUT THE RACE 
TODAY 
YES IT 
IS REMARKABLE THERE TODAY IS ALWAYS A STORY WITH THE GRAND 
NATIONAL AND THIS HORSE RED RUM 
WAS TRAINED BY GINGER MCCABE AND 
THIS YEAR THE FAVOURITE IS 
TRAINED BY HIS SON 
NORMAN'S TIP 
FOR THE GRAND NATIONAL IS 
HEDGEHUNTER I'M GOING FOR A 
LONGER PRICED HORSE MADISON 
AND EVERYONE WILL BE HAVING A 
FLUTTER AT FOUR MILLION ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE AND ONE JOCKEY 
WILL BE TAKING A WALK BACK THROUGH 
THESE MAGNIFICENT NEW STRAND 
GRANDSTANDS KNOWING THEY HAVE WON 
THE GRAND NATIONAL THERE WAS A 
LITTLE BIT OF RAIN LAST NIGHT BUT 
THE GOING REMAINS GOOD GOOD TO 
SOFT IN PLACES THERE IS A BIT OF FIVE 
BREEZE AND THERE ARE CLOUDS IN THE 
SKY WHICH WILL BE AN OMEN FOR 
THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BACKED CLOUDY 
LANE AND ALSO SNOW IS FORECASTS 
FOR THOSE WHO ARE BACKED SNOWY 
MORNING BUT MOST OF ALL WE ARE 
GOING TO BE GIVING YOU A REASON TO 
CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
FOR THE FAVOURITE IT IS A CASE OF 
LIKE FATHER LIKE SON GINGER MCCABE 
HAS WON FOUR TIMES AND NOW IT IS 
THE TURN OF HIS SON WE'LL BE 
SEEING INSIDE THE MIND OF A. P. MCCOY 
RECOVERING FROM A BROKEN BACK AND 
HE RIDES THE CABIN SIMON WAS 
GOING WELL WHEN HE FELL LAST YEAR 
ANDREW THORNTON IS INJURED SO 
DOMINIC ELSWORTH TAKES OVER THE 
RIDE RIDE AND I HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH AN 
TONNE JOHNSON THE HAIRDRESSER 
EXTRAORDINARY WHO OWNS ONE OF THE 
HORSES IN THE BIG RACE 
AND THERE IS CERTAINLY A CROWD 
BUILDING UP THEY'RE TRYING TO GET A 
GOOD PLACE TO ROAR IN THE WINNER 
AFTERWARDS WE HAD CLOUDY LANE 
ARRIVING AT TEN A M. THIS MORNING 
AFTER THE ONE HOUR JOURNEY FROM 
CHOLMONDELEY IN CHESHIRE AND DOPBL 
MACCONTAIN IS LOOKING DONALD 
MCCABE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO 
SADDLING HIM UP AND TONY MCCOY 
RIDE ING BUTLER'S CABIN 
AND TONY DOBBIN HAD A BAD FALL 
YESTERDAY BUT HE IS FIT TO RIDE 
AND HE WILL BE RETIRING IT WILL BE 
HIS LAST GRAND NATIONAL AND PAUL 
CASHBURY DO YOU REMEMBER HIM WHEN 
HE CAME INTO THE OLD WINNER'S 
ENCLOSURE HE SWUNG FROM THE 
RAFTERS HE WAS SO EXCITED THE 
START IS CRUCIAL WE'VE HAD DELAYED 
STARTS AND A VOID RACE BUT A NEW 
SYSTEM IS IN PLACE AND RICHARD 
PITTMAN HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING 
THE GRAND NATIONIAL MAY BE FOUR 
AND A HALF MILES LONG SO WHAT IS 
THE HURRY BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE 
START IS SO IMPORTANT AND SHAUN 
IT IS YOUR FIRST TIME STARTING THE 
GRAND NATIONAL 
YES AND I'M 
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
AND YOU HAVE 
A HUGE ROSTRUM WHERE YOU CAN 
OVERSEE EVERYTHING 
YES IT IS A 
LOT HIGHER THAN BEFORE AND FIFTEEN YARDS 
BACK FROM THE TAPE WE HAVE VERY 
VISIBLE MARKER POLES THEY ARE 
ORANGE AND THERE WILL BE FIVE WHITE 
LINE ACROSS THE COURSE AND THE 
INSTRUCTIONS THE RIDERS KNOW ABOUT 
ALREADY IS THAT IF THEY CROSS THE 
LINE BEFORE THE TAPE IS RELEASED 
THE TAPE WILL NOT BE RELEASED AND AND THIS GIVES YOU A CUSHION AND PLENTY 
OF ROOM FOR THEM TO CIRCLE AND THEY 
SHOULD NOT BREAK THE TAPE 
IF THEY 
BRAKE THE TAPE I'LL BE VERY 
DISAPPOINTED 
SO LET'S LOOK AT DISAPPOINTED THIS FIFTEEN YARDS WHICH SHOULD BE FIVE 
BUFFER AND THE GATE HAS ALTERED TO 
GO AWAY FROM THEM 
THE GATE HAS 
BEEN MODIFIED AND MODERNISED THE 
OLD GATES WERE MADE FROM WOOD AND 
WOULD SWELL UP WHEN IT WAS WET AND 
WERE VERY SLOW TO LIFT THE ANGLE 
HAS CHANGED AND THIS IS ALL HI TECH 
MECHANICAL STUFF ALTHOUGH SIMPLE 
AND IT IS ALL ELECTRICALY OPERATED 
AND IT 
IS LIGHTER AND GOES AWAY IT IT IS YOUR FIRST START WILL YOU BE NERVOUS NO 
WILL YOU GET THEM OFF NERVOUS NO FIRST TIME 
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO 
BUT IF NOT IT IS MY JOB TO GET THE 
RIDERS TO REGROUP SORT THEMSELVES 
OUT AND DO IT AGAIN 
I'M DOWN IN 
THE BETTING RING AND IT IS BUSY AND 
MONEY IS EXCHANGING HANDS INSIDE 
THE BETTING RING WE FIND JOHN PARR 
REMARKS T. T. WHAT ARE YOUR MEMORIES 
OF THE GRAND NATIONAL 
NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THE 
FIRST ONE WITH RICHARD PITTMAN BUT 
SEVENTY SEVEN IS THE FAMOUS ONE FOR ME WHEN 
RED RUM WON HIS THIRD 
AND HAVE YOU 
BACKED MANY 
NOT VERY MANY I 
BACKED MR. FRISK BUT HE DIDN'T COME 
THROUGH BUT IT IS A DIFFICULT RACE 
AND BEING A LOCAL PERSON YOU KNOW 
HOW SPECIAL THIS MEETING IS FOR THE 
PEOPLE OF LIVERPOOL ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY AND THE LADIES GET THEIR DRESSES 
OUT IT IS A MASSIVE MASSIVE EVENT 
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE BETTING RING ALL 
WEEK AND YOU'RE HERE TODAY WHAT 
ARE THE ESTIMATES 
THREE HUNDRED MILLION ON 
THE RACE ALONE AND CLOUDY LANE 
COULD BE CARRYING TWENTY MILLION JUST 
HIMSELF CLOUDY LANE GOING TO HIMSELF THE BETTING HORSE OF THE DAY OR ARE 
THE OTHERS COMING INTO THE PICTURE

HEDGEHUNTER OH HE'S GONE NOW 
THAT'S BAD HE'S GONE OFF THE 
SCREEN IF THAT WINS I'LL GIVE YOU 
THE MACHINE 
HE'LL BE A RICH MAN IF 
MAD SON DU BERYLIA WINS 
PLENTY OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OUT 
WALKING THE COURSE TO GET A FULL 
FLAVOUR OF THE EVENT YOU CAN GET 
RIGHT UP TO THE FENCES AND LIKE A 
LOT OF SPORTING EVENTS WHEN YOU 
ARE RIGHT UP IN THE GODS YOU DON'T 
GET A FEEL FOR IT BUT HERE THE 
JOCKEYS WALK RIGHT THROUGH THE 
CROWDS AND THE PEOPLE CAN GET A 
REAL FLAVOUR AND I'M AMONGST THE 
CROWDS THE RACE TRACK IS JUST THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE STANDS 
HERECOMESTANLEY IF YOU'VE WATCH 
THE GRAND NATIONAL ON THE B. B. C. IN 
THE PAST FEW YEARS THIS IS THE OLD 
WEIGHING ROOM AND UNSANDALSING 
ENCLOSURE BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED 
A LOT NOW THE NEW SNAZZY PADDOCK 
IS FURTHER UP THE HILL BUT NOWHERE 
HAS THE STORIES LIKE AINTREE AND 
THE PUNTERS LIKE AINTREE AND HERE 
IS THE PROOF TWO MEN WITH PLENTY 
OF GRAND NATIONAL EXPERIENCE 
ALONGSIDE ME RICHARD AND NORMAN 
THE COURSE IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD TAKE US 
THROUGH THE FOUR AND A HALF MILES 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE 
START BUT THEN LONG RUN ACROSS 
THE MELLING ROAD AND STRAIGHT TO 
THE FIRST FENCE LOT OF PEOPLE 
WILL BE TRYING TO GET THEIR HORSES 
SETTLED THE FIRST BIG TEST IS THE 
BIG OPEN DITCH A VERY VERY BIG 
FENCE ALMOST AS BIG AS THE CHAIR 
AND ONCE OVER THAT YOU HAVE A 
COUPLE OF PLAIN FENCES AND THE 
HORSES WILL RELAX AND GET INTO 
RHYTHM AND YOU GO STRAIGHT ON TO 
BECHER'S BROOK AND LOT OF PEOPLE 
GO STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE HERE 
YES EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE AMENDED 
IT IN RECENT YEARS IT IS STILL A 
BIT BIGGER ON THE INSIDE 
AND A HOT 
OF HORSES DON'T JUMP THE CANAL TURN 
VERY WELL THE HORSES COME OUT WIDE 
AND SHARP LEFT AND ON TO 
VALENTINE'S MORE HORSES AND 
JOCKEYS RELAXING AND GETTING INTO A 
RHYTHM AND THEN DOWN INTO THE 
STRAIGHT THERE IS ONLY ONE OPEN 
DITCH AND THEN A PLAIN FENCE AND 
ON THE SECOND CIRCUIT THEY'LL BE 
GETTING INTO POSITION BUT ON THE 
FIRST CIRCUIT AT THIS POINT ALL YOU 
HAVE IN YOUR HEAD IS COMING ALONG 
TO THE CHAIR TWO PLAIN FENCES 
BEFORE THE CHAIR AND IT'S IMPORTANT 
TO GET A GOOD SIGHT OF IT THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT YOU HAVE YOUR MIND ON THE 
CHAIR COMING AWAY FROM THE BEND 
THERE IS A HUGE DITCH IN FRONT OF 
THAT FENCE 
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS 
BETTER GOING ON THE INSIDE OF THE 
CHAIR CHAER STRAIGHT OVER THE 
WATER AND AROUND THE BEND AND 
THEN THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE STARTING 
TO RIDE A RACE 
YES YOU STILL HAVE 
YOUR MIND ON BEECHER'S WHICH COMES 
UP AGAIN FOR ME PULL OUT WIDE AND 
JUMP IT AND THEN AT THE SECOND 
CANAL TURN YOU START THINKING ABOUT 
RIDING THE RACE 
YES HERE YOU WANT 
TO BE IN THE FIRST SIX OR SEVEN 
ROUND TO THE SECOND TO LAST AND 
THE LAST FENCE COMING UP YOU'D 
CERTAINLY WANT TO BE NO MORE THAN 
THREE OR FOUR LENGTHS OFF THE LEAD 
AND I REMEMBER YOU TAKING FIVE PULL SO 
CLOSE TO THE LINE BUT IT IS A HELL 
OF A RUN IN WE'RE WATCHING SILVER 
BIRCH FROM LAST YEAR WHAT WOULD 
YOU SAY 
YES JUST NOT TO KICK TOO 
SOON TAKE YOUR TIME BECAUSE IT IS 
A VERY VERY LONG RUN IN 
HOW MUCH 
AFTER VICTORY DO YOU RECALL 
ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE RACE 
THE FIRST TIME CLARE IT WAS SO 
QUICK AND I WAS YOUNG AND I DON'T 
REMEMBER VERY MUCH AND WHEN YOU 
WIN IT'S LIKE ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE 
AND I ALWAYS SAID IF I WAS LUCKY 
ENOUGH TO WIN IT AGAIN I'D MAKE 
SURE I WOULD TAKE IT IN THE SECOND 
TIME ROUND AND I WAS LUCKY TO BE 
ABLE TO DO THAT 
THE FIRST YEAR I 
CAME IN IN A COMPLETE BLUR AND 
DIDN'T KNOW WHERE PEOPLE HAD 
FINISHED AND I MET JOHN ANOTHER 
JOCKEY PULLING HIS SADDLE IN AND I 
SAID HOW WAS IT AND HE SAID 
BRILLIANT AND WHEN I ASKED 
WHERE DID YOU COME HE SAID I 
FELL AT THE FIRST 
AND HOW MUCH 
WHEN YOU DON'T FINISH DO YOU BEAT 
YOURSELF UP 
WELL WHEN YOU GET 
CLOSE TO WINNING THAT'S ALL YOU 
WANT TO DO SOMEBODY LIKE TOM 
O'BRIEN IS YOUNG AND WILL HAVE TEN 
OR FIFTEEN RIDES IN HIS CAREER BUT AT 
MY STAGE WHEN I WON IT I WAS 
GETTING CLOSE TO THE END OF MY 
CAREER SO I WOULDN'T HAVE THAT 
MANY CHANCES SO YOU JUST WANT TO 
WIN 
I WAS LUCKY I WON TWICE AND WIN SAME SECOND A COUPLE OF TIMES AND 
I GOT SUCH A GREAT BUZZ OFF IT 
YOU CAN TELL FROM THE EXCITEMENT 
WITH WHICH THEY TALK ABOUT IT HOW 
MUCH IT MEANS TO THE JOCKEYS THIS 
IS NOT LIKE ANY OTHER RACE IT 
DOESN'T MATTER HOW COOL THEY TRY TO 
BE AS THEY GO OUT THERE THIS RACE 
IS VERY DIFFERENT HFPLT CLOUDY LANE

GRAND NATIONALLE AND HIS JOCKEY 
JASON MCGUIRE IS WITH ME HOW ARE 
YOU FEELING THREE HOURS BEFORE THE 
RACE

SECOND KHACHATURIAN JASON MAGUIRE 
THIRD IS NUMBER FIVE EATHCOTE THE 
WINNING JOCKEY IS RICHARD JOHNSON 
RICHARD DID YOU MEET ANY TROUBLE 
THERE WAS A LOT OUT THERE NOT NOT REALLY TO BE HONEST THE ONE LOOSE 
HORSE THAT ENDED UP FINISHING IN 
FRONT PROBABLY HELPED US GAVE US A 
GOOD LEAD THE RACE WENT REALLY 
WELL FOR ME BUT HE IS PROBABLY 
HORSE THAT'S IMPROVING HOPEFULLY 
HOW CONCERNED WERE YOU WHEN 
KHACHATURIAN GOT SO FAR CLEAR WE WE WENT A STRONG GALLOP AND ALL WEEK 
HERE YOU NEED TO GET HOME JUST ON 
THE SLOW SIDE OF GOOD UP THE 
STRAIGHT AND A FAST PACE I WAS 
FAIRLY SURE IF I COULD KEEP PICKING 
ENOUGH WE HAD A GOOD CHANCE YOU YOU ARE ON A GREY IN THE NATIONAL A 
GOOD OMEN 
LET'S HOPE SO 
THAT'S TWO HE WILL BE ON BOARD FOR 
FOR PAUL NICHOLLS FOR THE BIG RACE 
HE RODE A BEAUTIFUL RACE HERE THIS 
WAS A HORSE THAT HADN'T RUN SINCE 
MAY THERE IS RUBY WALSH WALKING 
BACK AFTER HIS FALL ON POQUELIN HE 
IS FINE AND HE WILL BE OUT TO RIDE 
IN THE NEXT OF COURSE AND OF COURSE 
IN HEDGEHUNTER IN THE GRAND 
NATIONAL THIS WAS AN INTERESTING 
RACE TO WATCH SO MANY OF THESE 
HORSES GOT TIRED FROM HOME 
INCLUDING SONG OF SONGS WHO WAS 
PULLED UP EVENTUALLY THE GREY 
HORSE ON THE RIGHT IS THE SREPBUAL 
WINNER A SREPBUAL WINNER A GOOD EXAMPLE HERE OF DICKIE 
JOHNSON'S RIDING 
GAVE HIM A GREAT 
RIDE JASON WENT ON BUT RICHARD 
TOOK HIS TIME THE LOOSE HORSE AS 
HE SAID HELPED HIM UP THE RUN IN 
IT GIVES RICHARD'S HORSE SOMETHING 
TO RACE WITH EATHCOTE COMES FROM A 
LONG WAY BACK AT TWENTY FIVE TO ONE AS FOR 
PEOPLE WHO BACKED THE FAVOURITE A 
LOT OF MONEY FOR HIM SONG OF SONGS 
OBVIOUSLY CHELTENHAM HAS LEFT ITS 
MARK TAKE NOTHING AWAY FROM THE 
WINNER RICHARD IS RIDING AS WELL 
AS EVER 
NOT SHOWING HIS AGE THAT 
HORSE GALLOPED ALL THE WAY TO THE 
LINE FOR HIM 
THAT SAYS THE BIG 
SMILE THAT SAYS I HAVE RIDDEN A 
WINNER ON GRAND NATIONAL DAY LET'S 
LOOK AT RUBY'S FALL ON POQUELIN 
THINK HE STEPPED YEAH A LONG WAY 
FROM THE HURDLE 
A. P. IS RIGHT BEHIND 
HIM WITH SONG OF SONGS AND THEY'RE 
TRYING TO AVOID THE DIFFICULTY IS 
NOT GETTING HIT BY OTHER HORSES 
HORRIBLE FALL MIRACLE THE HORSE 
STOOD UP HE IS LUCKY TO WALK AWAY 
WITH THAT 
I SOMETIMES THINK HURDLE 
FALLS ARE THE WORST 
THEY CAN BE 
YOU DON'T EXPECT IT YOU ARE FIRED 
INTO THE GROUND THIS IS BACK I 
THINK THAT'S THE SECOND LAST HURDLE 
RUNNING TO THE LAST HURDLE IF YOU 
BACKED THE ONE IN FRONT YOU 
CERTAINLY THOUGHT IT HAD WON PEARL 
KING COMES TO THE LAST FROM HERE 
ON IT ALWAYS LOOKED LIKE HE WAS 
GOING TO GET THERE 
DICKIE WAS 
SAYING THE LOOSE HORSE HELPED HIM 
IT ALSO KEPT KHACHATURIAN GOING AS 
WELL HELPED HIM YOU KNOW GOING 
DOWN TO THE LAST HERE YOU CAN SEE 
RICHARD PULLING CLEAR ON THE RUN IN 
THE HORSE DOES IT VERY NICELY 
GOOD SHOT THERE OF THE WINNER 
RICHARD JOHNSON WHO WILL BE TURKO THE CHEERS OF THE CROWD AND VERY 
EXCITED CROWD AFTER THE FIRST 
AND HUGE CROWD IN ATTENDANCE HERE 
THIS AFTERNOON 
RICHARD JOHNSON HE IS A VERY 
FORCEFUL RIDER BUT ON THAT 
OCCASION HE CAME FROM BACK IN THE 
FIELD QUITE OFTEN YOU SEE HIM UP 
THERE FORCING THE PACE INTERESTING 
TO SEE WHAT TACTICS HE ADOPTS ON 
TURKO LATER LEAD ON THAT PAUL 
NICHOLLS TRAINED CHASER IN THE 
GRAND NATIONAL TODAY ON THIS ONE 
HE JUMPED OFF LAST SO THERE IS 
SARAH HOBS WIFE OF THE WINNING 
TRAINER TRAINER AND THE WINNERS' ENCLOSURE WHERE 
ALL RIDERS HOPE TO BE AT AINTREE 
LET'S CHECK THE FULL DETAILS ON THE 
FIRST RACE TERRIFIC START TO THE DAY'S ACTION 
HERE I HOPE YOU HAVE NOTICED 
CLAIRE'S LOVELY NEW HAIRCUT SHE 
GOT IT AT THE HAIRDRESSERS TO AN 
OWNER BELONGING TO AN OWNER OF ONE 
OF THE RUNNERS IN TODAY'S GRAND 
NATIONAL AND TYPICALLY OF CLAIRE 
SHE MISSED HER APPOINTMENT WE ARE LOOKING FOR A CHANGE OF 
IMAGE I AM NOT SURE THIS IS QUITE 
THE ANSWER BUT I HAVE AGREED TO PUT 
MY HAIR IN THE HANDS OF MAN WHO 
IS DESCRIBED BY HIS CLIENTS AS 
MAGICIAN ANTON JOHNSON WHO HEADS 
UP THE SYNDICATE THAT OWNS MR. 
POINTMENT POINTMENT SOME OF MY FRIENDS ARE IN THE 
RACING GAME IN LAMB LAMBBORNE THEY 
SAID COME DOWN HERE WHEN I LOOK 
AROUND THE HIGH STREETS I DON'T 
SEE HAIR AS THE MAIN PRIORITY 
DON'T THINK I WOULD GET RICH OFF 
THE RACING FRATERNITY CUTTING HAIR 
NO BUT YOU WOULD GET LOADS OF 
TIPS YOU COULD DO WORK WITH SOME 
OF THE JOCKEYS COULDN'T YOU OH OH YEAH YEAH CHUCK DESPERATE NEED OF A HAIRCUT 
RUBY DESPERATE NEED OF A COLOUR 
THAT WOULD DO HIM THE WORLD OF GOOD 
SAM THOMAS HAS NICE HAIR 
WHEN YOU WATCH MR. POINTMENT RUN DO 
YOU RIDE HIM IN YOUR HEAD 
OH YEAH 
EVERY FENCE IT'S LIKE THE HORSE 
TAKES OFF YOUR HEART GOES UP TO 
YOUR THROAT THEN IT LANDS AGAIN 
AND IT GOES BACK DOWN AND YOU CARRY 
ON ON MR. POINTMENT A LENGTH IN FRONT 
WHAT A GREAT WEEKEND FOR THIS LAD 
SAM THOMAS HE WINS BY THREE PARTS 
OF A LENGTH ON MR. POINTMENT 
AINTREE WAS PHENOMENONAL 
PERFORMANCE THAT'S THE BEST 
EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD ON A 
RACE COURSE AFTER THAT PERFORMANCE 
THE NATIONAL WAS THE ONLY PLACE TO 
GO WITH HIM 
WHAT DID YOU THINK 
ABOUT THE WAY HE JUMPED AROUND 
AINTREE 
TYPICALLY LIKE A DUCK TO AINTREE WATER JUST LIKE A NATURAL HE DOES 
JUMP BIG HE PROBABLY HAS SPEED ON 
THE FLAT BETWEEN HIS FENCES TO 
ACTUALLY RUN IN A SHORTER TRIP TRIP 
BUT HE SPENDS TOO LONG IN THE AIR 
NOT LIKE A FAST JUMPER ARCHES HIS 
BACK AND USES HIMSELF WHICH IS 
PERFECT FOR THE BIG FENCES 
HOW DO 
YOU CONTROL THE SYNDICATE BECAUSE 
THEY'RE CLEARLY ALL KEEN I SAW 
THAT AT DONCASTER HOW DO YOU 
MANAGE THEIR EXPECTATIONS THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT TOO DIFFICULT A BUNCH REALLY 
ANYTHING TO REPORT GO DOWN TO THE 
RED LION SIX O'CLOCK PROBABLY FIND AT 
LEAST THREE IN THERE IT'S A SMALL 
COMMUNITY IF I SAID TO ONE OF MY 
CLIENTS IN THE SALON OR SOMETHING 
ABOUT THE HORSE THEY WOULD 
PROBABLY HAVE FOUND OUT AT FOUR HUNDRED 
IT'S A GREAT NAME FOR A NATIONAL 
HORSE 
YOU CAN SEE IT ON THE DAY HORSE NOW THE OLD DEAR SAT AT HOME 
HAVING HER BREAKFAST GOING PUT ME 
A FIVER ON THAT ONE TO HER HUSBAND 
BECAUSE IT'S A DECENT NAME THERE 
IS A MR. WON BEFORE MR. FRISK I AM HOPING AFTER THIS PEOPLE COME 
INTO YOUR SALON AND SAY I WANT A 
CLAIRE BALDING 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
FOR BUSINESS 
I LIKE IT ARE YOU 
HAPPY 
I THINK IT'S GREAT L. HAVE HAPPY REALLY ACHIEVED EXACTLY WHAT I 
WANTED TO DO GOT AWAY FROM A 
SMOOTH LOOKING SOMETHING MORE 
CHOPPY MORE TEXTURED MY ONLY 
WORRY IS CAN YOU COME BACK EVERY 
THREE WEEKS I WILL TRY I AM NOT SURE THE JOCKEYS 
APPRECIATED THE COMMENTS ABOUT 
THEIR HAIR BUT YOUR HAIR LOOKS 
FICK

THE BEGINNING BECAUSE OF THE CAMERA 
AND EVERYTHING HE WAS NERVOUS ALSO 
THE CAMERAMAN KEPT SAYING CAN YOU

GOOD HORSE AND KEEPS HIS JUMPING

EMOTIONAL GRAND NATIONALS EVER HE

FEATURE FILM JOHN HURT PLAYED THE 
CHAMPION WHO FOUGHT BACK TO FITNESS 
ARE YOU GOING TO DIE OR ARE YOU

CROWD IN A HOMAGE TO BOB CHAMPION

THE MOST MEMORY GRAND NATIONALS OF 
THEM ALL 
MARVELLOUS MAFLDZ 
MARVELLOUS 
FAN MARVELLOUS MARVELLOUS FANTASTIC I CAN'T BELIEVE IT L. 
ALWAYS SAID I'D WIN A NATIONAL BUT 
I NEVER BELIEVED IT 
THE TALE OF 
COURAGE AND DETERMINATION WON THEM 
THE B. B. C. TEAM OF THE YEAR AWARD FOR 
NINETEEN MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE NINETEEN MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE 
APPLAUSE RINGING OUT HERE FOR TONY 
DOBBIN WHO IS HAVING A 
PRESENTATION MADE TO HIM HE 
RETIRES NEXT WEEK AT CARLISLE AND 
HE'LL BE HAVING HIS VERY LAST RIDE 
ON THE GRAND NATIONAL ON POINT 
BARROW WHO WON IT AND HE WON ON 
LORD GALLEAN IN THE GRAND NATIONAL 
THAT HAD TO BE DELAYED BY A DAY 
BECAUSE OF THE BOMB SCARE NOW 
HAVE A LOOK AT TONY MCCOY PUTTING 
ON THE COLOURS OF KRUGUROVA 
BECAUSE HE WAS DUE TO RIDE ON 
ANOTHER HORSE BUT JIMMY MCCARTHY 
WAS MEANT TO RIDE HER BUT CANNOT 
NOW AND TALK ABOUT JOCKEYS 
REPLACING OTHERS IT NORMALLY ONLY 
HAPPENS BECAUSE JOCKEYS ARE INJURED 
CARL LLEWELLYN HAS BEEN ON TWO 
GRAND NATIONAL HORSES AND RELACED 
INJURED JOCKEYS AND IT COULD HAPPEN 
AGAIN WITH SIMON THE STORY OF 
SIMON IS A TALE OF TWO JOCKEYS ONE 
IS ANDREW WHO SADLY WILL MISS IT 
THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF HIS INJURY 
GIVE ING THIS YOUNG MAN A CHANCE OF 
GLORY 
I KNEW IT WAS FIVE DISLOCATION GLORY AND THE FIRST THING THAT FLASHED IN 
FRONT OF MY MIND WAS HOW LONG WILL 
IT TAKE ME TO GET BACK L. RAN UP TO 
RUBY WALSH AFTER I KNEW WHAT I HAD 
DONE AND I KNEW IT TOOK HIM FIVE 
WEEKS TO GET BACK AND I HAD SIX 
WEEKS BUT THE SPECIALIST TOLD ME 
THERE WAS NO CHANCE IT WOULD BE 
FIVE TO SIX MONTHS L. KNEW HE HAD A 
GREAT CHANCE HE WOULD BE MY BEST 
CHANCE OF POSSIBLY WINNING THE 
NATIONAL SO MY HEART SUNK 
FROM MY 
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IT'S BOTH 
MIXED WITH DISAPPOINTMENT BUT WHEN 
I LOOK AT MY GOOD MATE WHO IS 
DANGEROUSLY ILL IN HOSPITAL AFTER A 
BAD CAR CRASH I HAVE NOTHING TO 
WORRY ABOUT HE JUMPED ALL THE WAY 
UNTIL I SAW THE PICTURE OF HIM 
COMING THROUGH THE CHAIR WON'T 
TELL DOMIC THAT DON'T TELL HIM 
THAT AS A KID ALL I WANTED TO DO 
WAS RIDE IN THE NATIONAL YAM BUT 
AFTER YOU'VE RIDDEN IN IT THAT WAS 
MY LIFE TIME AMBITION WHEN I WAS 
TEN BUT AFTER YOU'VE RIDDEN IN IT 
YOU WANT TO WIN IT IF IT HAPPENS 
TO DOMINIC I'LL BE THE FIRST 
PERSON TO SHAKE HIM BY THE HAND 
AND SAY WELL DONE BUT I WOULDN'T 
BE HUMAN IF I DIDN'T THINK IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN ME YOU WERE IN 
THE SAME POSITION WITH GAY TRIP WE WE WERE TERRY COULDN'T RIDE HIM 
BECAUSE HE WAS SMASHED UP SO PATH 
T. ARCALIS FE RODE HIM AND HE WON 
SO MAYBE IT'S A GOOD OMEN 
THIS IS 
NOT A GOOD POSITION ME TALKING TO 
YOU ON THE GROUND 
NO I'M VERY 
UPSET I HAVE GOT A VERY GOOD 
SUBSTITUTE BUT I AM UPSET THAT 
YOU'RE NOT RIDING 
HE IS DOING WELL 
AND GIVING ME A HARD TIME 
CAN YOU 
TRY TO EXPLAIN FROM YOUR 
PERSPECTIVE THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT 
ANDY HAS TO FACE 
IT'S DESPERATE 
BAD LUCK BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT IS 
PART OF THE JOB THESE THINGS DO 
HAPPEN 
AND WHAT HAS ANDY TOLD YOU HAPPEN ABOUT SIMON TO HELP YOU ON THE DAY 
THE WAY HE JUMPS HE'S ONLY SMALL 
HORSE BUT I WOULDN'T GO ASKING TOO 
MUCH ESPECIALLY OVER SUCH A LONG 
RACE BUT HE DOES STAY ALL DAY AND 
HOPEFULLY HE'LL LIKE THE GROUND AND 
CONDITIONS 
HE IS A BIT KEEN BUT CONDITIONS PART OF THE PROBLEM IS GETTING 
SWITCHED OFF OVER THE FIRST HALF A 
MILE GET HIM TO DROP THE BRIDLE 
SAVING SAVING ALL THE TIME YES YES JUST GET HIM POPPING A BIT OF LUCK 
AND HE'LL GO CLEAR ALL THE WAY 
AROUND HE'S PROBABLY A BIT FURTHER 
FORWARD THIS YEAR THAN LAST YEAR 
HE LOOKS A MILLION DOLLARS I'M 
ENVIOUS I WISH IT WAS ME YES YES YES YES HE'S GOING TO BE WATCHING ANDREW 
THORNTON WITH MIXED FEELINGS THERE 
HE IS ON THE RIGHT TALKING TO 
DOMINIC ELSWORTH GOING THROUGH THE 
FENCES AND TALKING THROUGH WHAT 
WILL HAPPEN BUT IT WILL ALL BE 
DOWN TO DOMINIC WHEN HE GETS OUT 
THERE THE RUNNERS ARE MAKING THEIR 
WAY DOWN TO THE START OF THE NEXT 
RACE THE JOHN SMITH'S MAGHULL 
NOVICES' CHASE AND HERE ARE THE 
HORSES IT REALLY IS A GOOD RACE 
COMING UP AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
LOOKING AT TIDAL BAY L. THINK HE 
LOOKS WELL AS WELL 
HE LOOKS GOOD 
BUT THE TEAM ARE A BIT WORRIED 
ABOUT HIM COMING SO CLOSE TO 
CHELTENHAM 
AND TAKEROC THE LITTLE CHELTENHAM GREY IN THE HORSE 
YES HE JUMPED 
FORWARD AND RUBY WAS NEARLY ON THE 
DECK AGAIN TODAY 
AND KING LOUIS IS AN OUTSIDER YES YES I FINE BIG CHASER KING LOUIS 
WELCOME BACK TO THE STUDIO IAN

THINK IT WILL BE LIKE IN TODAY'S 
CROWD 
I DON'T KNOW L. CAN ONLY CROWD TELL LATER 
THE PACE OF THE LAST 
RACE WAS NOT SUICIDAL A. P. MCCOY 
THAT WAS A LOVELY SIGHT OF HIM 
GRABBING THE COLOURS OFF MCCARTHY 
YES YOU CAN SEE WHY HE WANTS TO 
GET ON THIS LOVELY LITTLE MARE SHE 
IS HONEST AND GOOD AND THE TRAINER 
SAYS SHE IS A LITTLE HEAVIER THAN 
AT CHELTENHAM SO SHE HAS GOT OVER 
THAT RACE WELL 
A. P. CERTAINLY GETS 
ON WITH THIS MARE WELL AND THAT IS 
WHY HE WAS SO KEEN TO RIDE HER AND 
PULLED JIMMY MC CAR THEE OFF WELL WELL WE HAVE AN ARRANGEMENT THAT HE 
RIDES FOR J. P. FIRST BUT THEN IF HE 
IS AVAILABLE HE RIDES MY HORSES 
AND WE STICK TO OUR ARRANGEMENT 
YES WE SAW WITH VOY POR USTEDES AND 
MASTER MINDED THAT THE DISTANCES 
CAN BE TURNED AROUND HERE AT 
AINTREE COMPARED TO CHELTENHAM 
THEY CAN AND IT'S A DIFFERENT 
TRACK AND A DIFFERENT GROUND AND 
THE HORSES HAVE HAD A HARD RACE A 
CHELTENHAM BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO 
BE SUBSTANDARD TO BEAT HER AND YOU 
HAVE TO RESPECT NICHOLLS' HORSE 
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO FORM LINES IT 
WILL BE FIVE COMPETITIVE RACE BUT WE 
HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE HERE

DESERVED FAVOURITE AND HE'S A VERY 
GOOD HORSE BUT WE HAVE SEEN GOOD 
HORSES WHO ALL RAN WELL AT

HERE IS RISHI TALKING TO THE 
WINNING JOCKEY DENIS O'REGAN 
DELIGHTED AND YOU LOOKED EMOTIONAL 
AFTER THE RACE IT SEEMS TO HAVE 
BEEN A SPECIAL VICTORY FOR YOU IT IT IS SPECIAL BECAUSE ALL THE 
CHELTENHAM WINNERS WERE GETTING 
BEATEN THIS WEEK EXCEPT FOR OUR 
VIC AND HE DIDN'T TRAVEL WELL 
TODAY BUT I'M OVER THE MOON 
BETWEEN THE SECOND TO LAST AND LAST 
YOU STARTED TO REALLY GO FOR IT AND 
GAVE HIM COUPLE OF SMACKS AS WELL 
YES I DIDN'T HAVE TO GET WELL STUCK INTO HIM BUT I ENDED UP MY 
FAULT GIVING HIM A HARD RACE AT 
CHELTENHAM WHEN HE DIDN'T NEED IT 
BUT IT WAS THE ARKLE BUT I'M GLAD 
HE'S COME UP WITH THE GOODS TODAY 
THANK GOD 
WELL DONE AND GILLY 
YOU HAVE INGLIS DREVER AND TIDAL 
BAY HOW IS IT FOR YOU 
IT IS THE 
LUCKIEST DAY OF MY LIFE RINGING 
HOWARD JOHNSON TWO YEARS AGO IN 
JULY THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT 
THANK YOU MR. JOHNSON 
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU ALL THIS 
WAS IMPRESSIVE LET'S REMIND 
OURSELVES OF HOW IT HAPPENED FOR A 
LONG TIME IT DIDN'T LOOK AS IT 
TIDAL BAY WAS GOING TO CATCH THE 
GREY 
YES HE WON LAST TIME GREY IMPRESSIVELY AT CHELTENHAM OVER TWO 
MILES WHICH IS A STIFF TEST OF 
STAMINA WHAT DOES HE DO THERE RUN 
AROUND A BIT 
I THINK HE'D GONE TO 
THE FRONT UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE 
AND DENIS HE DOESN'T HAVE A HARD 
HOLD OF HIS HEAD AND HE LET GO A 
LITTLE BIT BUT JUMP BY GOLLY 
THAT WAS MOTORING IF HE'D TURNED 
OVER HE WOULDN'T HAVE STOPPED 
MOTORING SO HE'S WON HERE AND AT 
CHELTENHAM 
I WOULDN'T GIVE UP ON CHELTENHAM TAKEROC WE SAW HIM IN THE PADDOCK 
AND HE WAS VERY FIZZY AND HE 
DIDN'T GIVE HIMSELF A CHANCE TO 
LAST OVER THE TRIP 
AND KRUGUROVA 
IS AT THE BACK OF THE PICTURE BUT 
EMPTIED RATHER QUICKLY THIS IS 
IMPRESSIVE AND VERY PERTINENT THAT 
A CHELTENHAM WINNER CAME OUT TO WIN 
HERE 
YES AS DENIS SAID OUR VIC HERE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID IT AND 
BEAT KAUTO STAR ON THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON AFTERNOON AND AGAIN DENIS REGAN VERY MUCH 
LIKE RUBY WALSH COMING OVER FROM 
IRELAND AND HE DOES COMMUTE BUT 
NOT AS MUCH BUT THE MAJORITY OF 
TOP JOCKEYS ARE IRISH 
YES AND THE 
REASON FOR THAT IS THEY GET BORN ON 
PONIES AND RIDE WITH NO SADDLES 
BEFORE THEY CAN WALK ALMOST BUT BUT GILLY WHO LOOKS AFTER THIS HORSE 
IS AN AMAZINGLY EMOTIONAL GIRL AND 
WHEN SHE COMES INTO THE WINNERS' 
ENCLOSURE SHELL PROBABLY DO A 
DOUBLE SUMMER ASSAULT AND A 
PIROUETTE PIROUETTE A SOMERSAULT SHE SERVED IN THE 
ISRAELI NATIONAL ARMY THEY HAVE TO 
DO NATIONAL SERVICE IN ISRAEL SO 
SHE DID HER TIME IN THE ARMY AND 
SHE THAT HAS AN INTERESTING BLEPBTD 
OF ACCENTS A BIT OF BLEND OF 
ACCENTS ARGENTINIAN AND ISRAELI 
AND A BIT OF THE MIDDLE EAST SO 
MULTINATIONAL IS GILL AND LET'S 
LOOK AT THE BETTING IF YOU FANCY THE WINNER FOR THE 
QUEEN MOTHER CHAMPION CHASE TIDAL 
BAY AND SPOILT BOY ARE THE TWO 
OUTSTANDING ONES 
AND HE'S ONLY A 
FIVE YEAR OLD SO YOU WOULD EXPECT 
HIM TO IMPROVE PLENTY WITH A BIT OF 
RACING 
AND DENIS O'REGAN NO RACING DISGUISING HIS DELIGHT TO COME INTO 
THE WINNERS' ENCLOSURE FOR THIS 
RACE LET'S HOPE HE DOES SO LATER 
IN THE DAY A LOVELY SHOT OF THE WINNING HORSE 
TIDAL BAY 
THE WINNER OF OUR SECOND RACE HERE 
ON GRAND NATIONAL DAY AT AINTREE 
AND THAT IS SOME OUTFIT THAT ANDREA 
WEELY HAS THE TWO LADS AND 
BETWEEN THEM IS THE YOUNG EST TWO 
RIDERS IN THE GRAND NATIONAL NAM 
NICK YOU'RE ONLY EIGHTEEN AND THE ONLY 
AMATEUR 
YES BEING THE YOUNGEST AMATEUR TAKES A LITTLE OF THE PRESSURE OFF 
HOW SO 
I DON'T KNOW BUT I THINK 
IT DOES 
ARE YOU NERVOUS 
NO I 
JUST CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUT THERE 
AND AIDEN YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL 
CHANCE

SHOULDN'T BE TOO FAR AWAY YOU YOU FIRST RODE IN THE RACE WHEN YOU 
WERE ONE 
I WAS L. DIDN'T HAVE A RIDE 
UNTIL I WAS NINETEEN OVER FENCES SO IT 
IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN 
YEAR OLDS ARE GOING OUT THERE AND 
RIDING AS WELL AS I DID WHEN I WAS 
TWENTY FIVE INCREDIBLE 
WHAT WOULD YOU TWO 
LIKE TO ASK RICHARD IT'S NOT OFTEN 
YOU GET TO TALK TO A TWO TIMING 
GRAND NATIONAL WINNER 
I DON'T 
THINK I HAVE ENOUGH TIME WITH ALL 
THE QUESTIONS BUT THE FIRST FENCE 
SEEMS TO BE THE BOGEY FENCE MOST 
YEARS WHAT DID YOU DO MOST OF THE 
TIME 
IT IS L. WAS WALKING PART OF TIME THE COURSE THE OTHER DAY BACK FROM 
THE SECOND TO LAST AND IT'S VERY 
IMPORTANT THE START YOU CAN'T 
UNDERESTIMATE THE START GET A GOOD 
BREAK IF YOU CAN JUMP OUT AND GET 
THE HORSES ACROSS THE MELLING ROAD 
AND THE APPROACH TO THE FIRST FENCE 
IS VERY IMPORTANT 
AND HOW MUCH ARE 
YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS FOLLOWING 
YOUR FORTUNES TODAY
