WHAT DOES EARL GREY A BAG OF SALT AND VINEGAR CRISPS AND THE WORLD'S FIRST TILTING BRIDGE HAVE IN COMMON 
THEY ALL COME FROM THE NORTH EAST AND SO DO WE TODAY 
WELCOME TO FLOG IT WELCOME TO NEWCASTLE 
TODAY WE'RE IN NEWCASTLE AND OUR VENUE IS THE METRO RADIO ARENA 
THIS VENUE IS USED TO HOSTING HUGE ROCK AND POP CONCERTS 
ICE HOCKEY BASKETBALL EVEN SHOW JUMPING 
TODAY IT'S PLAYING HOST TO FLOG IT AND ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE HERE TO ASK THAT ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION 
AND WHAT IS IT WHAT'S IT WORTH 
SO WE'D BETTER GET THEM INSIDE AND FIND OUT 
THE ARENA IS FILLING UP FAST AND OUR EXPERTS 
KATE BLISS AND ANITA MANNING ARE ALREADY STRAIGHT IN SEARCHING FOR THE BEST ITEMS 
LEANNE EVERYONE LOVES ANDY CAPP 
ALTHOUGH WE WOULD HARDLY CALL HIM A MODERN MAN 
NO NO 
NOT IN OUR TIMES 
TELL ME WHERE DID YOU GET THIS 
MY AUNT WAS THE MANAGERESS IN A CLEANER'S AND HE USED TO COME IN AND BRING HIS CLOTHING IN 
HIS WIFE WANTED SOME ALTERATIONS DOING AND MUM WAS A SEAMSTRESS 
SO SHE STARTED DOING THE ALTERATIONS 
SO THEY GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER QUITE WELL 
AND THEN WE WERE IN AS CHILDREN ONE DAY AND WE GOT TO MEET HIM 
AND IT WAS JUST A NICETY SO REG SMYTHE DID THIS CARTOON 
FOR YOU PERSONALLY YES HE DID 
ORIGINALLY THESE CARTOONS WERE DONE FOR THE DAILY MIRROR JUST FOR NORTHERN READERS 
RIGHT THEY DIDN'T THINK SOUTHERNERS WOULD APPRECIATE THE HUMOUR 
BUT THEY WERE WRONG BECAUSE WITHIN SIX MONTHS IT'D BECOME SO POPULAR 
THAT IT WAS PUBLISHED U. K. WIDE 
AND WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS IT WAS WORLDWIDE 
SO EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING AT THESE CARTOONS 
AND LOVING THEM AND LAUGHING ABOUT THEM 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
WE'VE GOT FLO ON HER HANDS AND KNEES SAYING THAT'S RIGHT SHOVE OFF WITHOUT A WORD 
AND THERE'S ANDY PUTTING HIS JACKET ON 
SORRY PET I'VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS ON MY MIND 
SHE SAYS IF YOU'D LIKE TO UNBURDEN Y'SELF PET DON'T FORGET YOUR WIFE IS YOUR BEST FRIEND 
OR AT LEAST I COULD BE IF E. CAME O. M. E. MORE OFTEN YES 
AND UNDERNEATH WE HAVE LEANNE BEST WISHES 
FROM ANDY CAPP AND AMP FLO REG SMYTHE 
AND UP AT THE TOP HERE WE HAVE 
WEDNESDAY THURSDAY THE EIGHTH OF THE THIRD SEVENTY NINE 
WHICH IS WHEN HE DID THIS CARTOON 
TELL ME WHY YOU'RE WANTING TO SELL IT 
IT'S LOVELY BUT IN THE DECOR THERE'S NOWHERE TO PUT IT SO IT LIVES IN THE WARDROBE 
ANDY CAPP LIVES IN THE WARDROBE 
WELL THERE ARE MANY FEMINISTS WHO THINK THAT'S WHERE HE SHOULD BE PUT AND NOT BROUGHT OUT 
SO IT'S NOT ON DISPLAY 
NO IT'S NOT ON DISPLAY WHICH IS A SHAME 
IT'S NOT WORTH AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY ALTHOUGH I WOULD CALL IT A SPECULATIVE PIECE 
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH LEANNE 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO PUT IT IN WITH AN ESTIMATE OF PERHAPS FORTY TO SIXTY 
WOULD YOU FEEL HAPPY AT THAT 
YES THAT'S NO PROBLEM 
IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE THIS TYPE OF ITEM BECAUSE IT IS A LOCAL PIECE BEING SOLD IN A LOCAL AUCTION 
SO LET'S HOPE THAT IT'LL DO WELL BECAUSE OF THAT 
AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL BE HAPPY 
LOVELY SHALL WE PUT IT TO AUCTION YES PLEASE LET'S GO FOR IT THANK YOU 
WHAT MADE YOU BRING THIS ALONG TODAY 
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT THE NAME OF IT AND EVERYTHING AND WE COULDN'T 
RIGHT WHAT'S IT GOT UNDERNEATH LET'S HAVE A LITTLE LOOK 
OH WE'VE GOT A LETTER H. AND THEN WE'VE GOT SOME NUMBERS HERE 
O. K. SO YOU WANTED TO KNOW WHO MADE IT 
WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT 
WELL NOTHING REALLY 
DO YOU LIKE IT YES I LIKE IT 
I THOUGHT IT WILL GO TO MY DAUGHTER BUT SHE SAID SHE WOULD PUT IT IN A CUPBOARD AND NOT USE IT 
RIGHT O. K. SO WE JUST THOUGHT WE WOULD TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS 
WELL I'M REALLY GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT ALONG BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY AN ATTRACTIVE PIECE 
I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU AND I'M A BIT DUBIOUS THAT I WON'T GET MY PRICE FOR IT 
WHAT SORT OF FIGURE WERE YOU THINK OF FOR IT WELL I WAS THINKING AT LEAST IT WAS FOUR HUNDRED 
AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED YEAH THEN YOU GET YOUR COMMISSION SO YOU'RE NOT GETTING FOUR HUNDRED 
AUCTION HOUSES CHARGE COMMISSION 
THEY CHARGE IT SO I'D RATHER KEEP IT THAN LET IT GO FOR NEXT TO NOTHING 
LET'S HAVE A CLOSER LOOK AT IT THEN I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK 
THIS SORT OF GLASS IS KNOWN AS IRIDESCENT GLASS 
BECAUSE IT'S GOT THIS BEAUTIFUL SHEEN ON IT ALMOST METALLIC LUSTRE 
AND THERE WERE TWO LEADING MANUFACTURERS 
OF THIS TYPE OF GLASS A COMPANY CALLED LOWETTS IN AUSTRIA 
AND THEN THEIR RIVAL THE OTHER BIG PRODUCER 
WAS LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN AMERICA 
MM HMM LOWETTS STARTED INTRODUCING IRIDESCENT GLASS AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY 
AND IT WAS REALLY A PHENOMENON OF THAT PERIOD 
THE TURN OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND VERY MUCH A PRODUCT OF THE ART NOUVEAU PERIOD 
THIS TYPE OF SHAPE AND DECORATION TYPICALLY INCORPORATED 
ART NOUVEAU MOTIFS SUCH AS THIS LOVELY FLORAL DESIGN 
BUT THIS ENAMELLING HERE IS LOVELY 
IT'S REALLY NICE QUALITY THAT'S LAID ONTO THE GLASS THERE 
AND TYPICAL SORT OF ART NOUVEAU DECORATION WITH LONG 
SINUOUS STEMS AND THEN FLOWERS 
AND ALMOST SORT OF LILYPAD SHAPED LEAVES ANOTHER TYPICAL MOTIF 
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO FIND OUT WHO MADE IT YES 
I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHO THIS IS BY IN FACT A LOT OF IRIDESCENT GLASS WAS NEVER MARKED 
SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TRACE AND PINPOINT TO A PARTICULAR FACTORY 
IN TERMS OF VALUE I THINK IT'S A VERY ATTRACTIVE PIECE 
AND THIS DEEP PURPLE GLASS PARTICULARLY IS VERY POPULAR YES 
BUT AT AUCTION I'D LIKE TO PUT AN ESTIMATE OF TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED ON IT 
I THINK YOUR FOUR HUNDRED MIGHT BE PUSHING IT A LITTLE BIT 
I THINK TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED WOULD CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE 
AND I HOPE WE MIGHT REACH YOUR FOUR HUNDRED 
BUT I THINK IF WE ESTIMATE IT AT THAT IT MIGHT PUT PEOPLE OFF A BIT 
ARE YOU HAPPY TO SELL IT AT THAT 
YES I WILL DO O. K. 
LOVELY RIGHT THANKS 
LOUISE I ABSOLUTELY LOVE TAXIDERMY AND EVERY VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN HOME 
WITH ASPIRATIONS OF GRANDEUR WOULD HAVE HAD TAXIDERMY IN IT 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO DISPLAY TO SHOW TO THEIR FRIENDS 
BECAUSE IT WAS THE VICTORIANS THAT REALLY HAD A THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE AND DISCOVERY AND EDUCATION 
AND THEY WANTED TO SHOW EVERYBODY WHAT THEY'D GOT IT WAS A GREAT LEARNING TOOL TAXIDERMY 
SO HOW DID YOU COME BY THE RED SQUIRRELS THEY CAME FROM MY FATHER 
HE INHERITED THEM FROM HIS GRANNY WHEN HE PASSED AWAY THEY CAME TO ME 
AND HE WASN'T A COLLECTOR OF TAXIDERMY NO 
UP UNTIL ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO I WASN'T AND NOW I'VE STARTED COLLECTING IT YEAH 
I HAVE FOUND A BEAUTY IN IT BECAUSE I THINK TAXIDERMY AT ITS BEST IS ART FORM 
YOU HAVE TO BE A LOVER OF ANIMALS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THEM LOOK RIGHT 
THEY WERE CONSUMMATE ARTISTS TAXIDERMISTS 
THESE ANIMALS ACTUALLY HAD TO BE SKINNED THEIR BONES WERE TAKEN OUT 
AND ALL THE FAT WAS SCRAPED OFF THE FLESH 
THEN THE FLESH WAS BROUGHT BACK 
THE SKULL WAS LEFT IN SHAPE WITH THE MOUTH 
IT WOULD THEN HAVE A WIRE FRAME MADE FOR IT AND PUT INSIDE THE SKIN 
THE WIRE FRAME WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED IN A WADDING 
THE SKIN WOULD'VE BEEN COATED IN A BORAX ACID TO PRESERVE IT 
GLASS EYES WERE ADDED FOR AUTHENTICITY PAPIER MACHE SOMETIMES 
TO BUILD UP THE MOUTH AND THE TONGUE AND TO BE PAINTED 
WE'VE GOT TWO SQUIRRELS PLAYING IN A NATURALISTIC SETTING 
WITH THEIR HAZELNUTS IN A WOODED AREA 
IF THEY WERE NEW SQUIRRELS WE WOULDN'T SELL THEM 
IF THIS WAS DONE LAST WEEK BUT THIS DATES BACK TO ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED NINETEEN TEN 
IT IS EARLY EDWARDIAN 
I CAN TELL IT'S THAT OLD BECAUSE THE CASE IS THAT OLD AND IT'S NEVER BEEN OPENED IT'S NEVER BEEN REMOVED 
THERE'S NO NEW NAILS 
AND THIS INCIDENTALLY THE PUTTING AROUND THE EDGE 
THE VICTORIANS OR EDWARDIANS WOULDN'T HAVE USED PUTTY 
THEY'D HAVE USED A PLASTER AND DISGUISED IT TO LOOK LIKE PUTTY 
OR PAINTED OVER IT AND THIS IS WHAT THIS IS 
THIS IS A VERY HARD PLASTER I THINK THAT'S LOVELY 
IT'S NOT EVERYBODY'S CUP OF TEA AND PEOPLE ARE GOING OH MY GOD HE'S GONE OFF HIS ROCKER 
BUT THEY DO SELL RIGHT SQUIRRELS I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL BE THAT POPULAR 
OBVIOUSLY STUFFED PHEASANTS FOXES BIRDS IN PARTICULAR 
FISH FETCH BIG BIG BIG MONEY 
A COUPLE OF LITTLE SQUIRRELS LIKE THIS I WOULD EXPECT TO GET AROUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY REALLY THAT MUCH 
EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY LET'S GO FOR THE TOP END 
TREMENDOUS YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THEM HOME I DON'T LIKE THEM 
THAT'S IT YOU EITHER LOVE OR HATE THEM 
I'D RATHER THEY WENT TO SOMEBODY WHO COULD APPRECIATE THEM FOR THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THEM 
I JUST DON'T NEVERTHELESS I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC O. K. 
WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS PICTURE RAY 
IN TRUTH NOT A LOT NOT A LOT 
IT LOOKS BASIC IT LOOKS BASIC 
IT'S NOT A MONA LISA OR NOWT LIKE THAT YOU'D LIKE THE MONA LISA 
AYE BUT WE COULDN'T FIND IT 
WHERE DID IT COME FROM 
I FOUND IT LAST WEEK IN MY NANA'S HOUSE JUST LAST WEEK 
SHE'S IN ILL HEALTH WE WANTED TO CLEAR SOME STUFF OUT TO MOVE HER AND WE FOUND THIS IN THE ATTIC 
SO IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY BASIC WHAT MADE YOU HOLD ON TO IT AND BRING IT ALONG TODAY 
BECAUSE IT LOOKS OLD AND IT'S GOT PINS IN THE TOP JUST LOOKS OLD 
IT IS FAIRLY OLD YES 
I WOULD DATE IT ANYWHERE BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE AND NINETEEN HUNDRED PERHAPS 
HAVE YOU DONE ANY RESEARCH ON THE ARTIST WE HAVE GOT A SIGNATURE 
I HAD A QUICK LOOK ON THE INTERNET 
I FOUND HE DIED IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE IF IT'S THE SAME FELLOW 
HE WAS A LOCAL ARTIST THAT'S ALL I KNOW 
WELL IF YOU'RE RIGHT AND THE SIGNATURE CERTAINLY SUGGESTS THERE 
F. SLATER THEN THIS PICTURE WOULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO A JOHN FALCONER SLATER WHO 
YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT IS A LOCAL ARTIST TO NORTHUMBRIA AND NEWCASTLE 
HE WAS BASED HERE AND IN FACT DID MOST OF HIS EXHIBITING HERE 
AROUND TYNESIDE AND IN HIS OWN AREA 
AND HE DID A LOT OF LANDSCAPES WORKING MOSTLY IN OILS 
BUT HE WAS BEST KNOWN IN FACT FOR HIS MOODS OF THE SEA PICTURES 
AND IN FACT IT'S WHAT MADE HIM ONE OF THE BEST NORTHERN IMPRESSIONIST PAINTERS 
WE CAN SEE HERE FROM THE START OF THIS LANDSCAPE 
IT IS VERY IMPRESSIONIST WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT CLOSELY 
THE COLOURS AT THE MOMENT ARE VERY AUTUMNAL 
THAT'S BECAUSE IT NEEDS A JOLLY GOOD CLEAN 
I THOUGHT IT LOOKED A BIT BROWN 
WHICH MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE FACT YOU THOUGHT IT LOOKS QUITE OLD 
BUT IT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY FILTHY 
AND WITH VERY CAREFUL CLEANING A GOOD RESTORER COULD BRING IT UP 
AND YOU'D SEE THE PICTURE IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LIGHT 
THE WHOLE TONE OF THE PICTURE WOULD BE CHANGED 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO SELL IT IT'S BEST YOU LEAVE IT EXACTLY HOW IT IS 
THE PURCHASER CAN MAKE UP HIS MIND AND CLEAN IT THE WAY HE SEES FIT 
DO YOU LIKE IT ANY BETTER NO IT STILL LOOKS DULL I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M LOOKING AT 
SO YOU'RE QUITE HAPPY TO FLOG IT IT'S FOR MY NANA'S SAKE 
SHE'S MOVING HOUSE INTO A BUNGALOW ANY LITTLE BIT HELPS REALLY 
SO WE NEED TO RAISE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE CAN FOR HER YES PLEASE 
I'M GOING TO BE FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE ABOUT THIS ONE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S ONE OF HIS BEST 
I'LL ESTIMATE IT AT AUCTION AT TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED PERHAPS WITH A RESERVE 
AT JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED PERHAPS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TO GIVE THE AUCTIONEER A BIT OF DISCRETION 
WHATEVER YOU THINK THAT'S BRILLIANT 
IT'S BEEN HECTIC HERE IN NEWCASTLE HERE'S THE FIRST BATCH OF ANTIQUES READY TO GO OFF TO AUCTION 
WE'RE IN THE RIGHT TOWN FOR IT 
SO LET'S HOPE FOR A COUPLE OF ANDY CAPP COLLECTORS 
TO PUSH THE PRICE UP ON LEANNE'S CARTOON 
I'M CONFIDENT THE BIDDERS WILL LOVE THE GRACEFUL LINES OF THE ART NOUVEAU VASE 
MY CHOICE NEXT THE RED SQUIRRELS WHICH HAVE BEEN OUT OF FASHION BUT ARE NOW BACK IN VOGUE 
AND THE LOCAL PAINTING IT MAY NOT BE THE MONA LISA BUT IT SHOULD DO WELL 
WE HAVE NOW MOVED SOUTH OF THE TYNE TO THE BOLDEN AUCTION GALLERIES 
WHERE OUR AUCTIONEER GILES HODGES IS TAKING A LOOK AT ANDY AND FLO 
THIS HAS GOT TO DO WELL LOCAL INTEREST HERE 
VERY MUCH SO REG SMYTHE IS A LOCAL ARTIST WROTE FOR THE DAILY MIRROR SURPRISED THE LADY WANTS TO SELL IT 
WELL LEANNE BROUGHT IT IN 
SHE'S HAD A VALUATION OF FORTY FIFTY SIXTY MAXIMUM 
I WOULDN'T SELL IT IF I WAS HER 
IT IS A LOVELY BIT OF MEMORABILIA BUT WHAT'S GOING TO LET IT DOWN 
IT WILL SELL IT WILL MAKE ITS MONEY QUITE EASILY BUT IT'S GOT HER NAME ON IT YOU DON'T WHAT THAT 
IF SOMEONE SIGNS AN AUTOGRAPH IT SHOULD BE BEST WISHES REG SMYTHE 
AS SOON AS YOU PUT SOMEBODY'S NAME ON IT HOW MANY OTHER LEANNES ARE THERE THAT IT WOULD FIT 
AND WHO WOULD WANT IT AS WELL IT'S A BIG PROBLEM 
BUT AS YOU SAID THE ESTIMATE PLACED ON IT I THINK QUITE CONFIDENTLY IT WILL SELL 
WHEN I SAY A LOT OF LOCAL INTEREST IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE COME ACROSS A LOT OF 
DO WE SEE THESE CARTOONS UP HERE 
I'VE BEEN BASED IN THE NORTH EAST FOR SEVEN YEARS AND HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING WITH ANDY CAPP 
SO IT IS QUITE RARE IT IS INDEED YES 
FINGERS CROSSED ON THIS ONE 
THIS ONE COULD BE A SURPRISE IT COULD BE INDEED 
HOPEFULLY THERE'LL BE TWO PEOPLE IN HERE THAT WANT THIS BOTH CALLED LEANNE HOPEFULLY YES

SEEING AS THEY WERE HIS TAKE MUM AWAY AND CHEER HER UP 
WELL SOME GOOD RESULTS SO FAR BUT DON'T FORGET THERE'S PLENTY MORE 
AUCTION ACTION TO COME LATER ON IN THE SHOW 
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME TO NIP BACK OVER THE TYNE TO NEWCASTLE 
TO FIND OUT A BIT MORE ABOUT SOME LOCAL RECENT HISTORY 
NOWADAYS NEWCASTLE'S TEESSIDE IS A VIBRANT AREA BRIMMING WITH CHARACTER AND LIFE 
THIS AREA IS ONE OF THE OLDEST PARTS OF THE TOON 
AND IT WAS THE COMMERCIAL HUB OF TYNESIDE FOR MANY CENTURIES 
BUT BY THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IT BECAME INCREDIBLY RUNDOWN 
AND THE RENTS WELL THEY WERE VERY CHEAP AS WELL 
AND THAT'S WHEN A FILM MAKING CO OPERATIVE CALLED AMBER FILMS MOVED IN 
THEY'RE STILL HERE TODAY AND MURRAY MARTIN IS ONE OF THE FOUNDING MEMBERS 
MURRAY WHAT WAS THIS AREA LIKE WHEN YOU MOVED IN 
WELL VISUALLY IT WASN'T RADICALLY THAT MUCH DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS 
BECAUSE IT STILL FEELS DOMINATED BY VICTORIAN BUILDINGS 
BUT THEY WERE MUCH GREYER AND SATANIC THAT THEY ARE NOW 
AND IT WAS AN AREA WHICH WAS DOOMED 
THERE WAS A SORT OF MYTHOLOGY ABOUT THE QUAYSIDE WHICH SAID DON'T GO THERE 
DON'T GO AT NIGHT IT'S DANGEROUS IT'S FULL OF PROSTITUTES AND CRIMINALS 
AND YOU'LL GET MUGGED WHICH WAS NEVER TRUE IN OUR EXPERIENCE 
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF VITALITY IN AN AREA LIKE THAT 
AND THAT SORT OF AREA WOULD ATTRACT ARTISTS LIKE YOU 
WELL IT'S GREAT ROMANCE IN A WAY 
AND ALSO THEY ARE THE AREAS WHICH ARE ALSO HISTORICALLY CHEAP 
THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHEAPNESS AND FREEDOM WHICH IS IMPORTANT 
WE USED TO RENT THESE BUILDINGS A COTTAGE FOR ONE POUND WEEK 
THREE POUNDS FOR THE MIDDLE FLOOR TWO POUNDS FOR THE TOP TWO FLOORS SIX QUID A WEEK 
WE HAD A HUGE AREA YOU COULDN'T GET THAT NOW 
NO YOU COULDN'T SO YOU FOUND OUT AND YOU REALISED THAT THE COUNCIL 
HAD A LOT OF BIG PLANS A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT FOR THE QUAYSIDE 
WE FOUND THAT THE COUNCIL HAD GOT AN AGREEMENT 
WITH PROPERTY DEVELOPERS TO DEMOLISH THE WHOLE OF THE EAST OF THE QUAYSIDE 
AND WE WERE QUITE SHOCKED BY THIS 
AND WE FELT THE LEAST WE'VE GOT TO DO IS TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
HOW DID YOU REACT DID YOU WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT PROVOKED 
WELL WE SEE OURSELVES AS CREATIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FEELING AND DOCUMENTING AN AREA 
SO WE THOUGHT THE BEST WAY TO RAISE THE ISSUE WAS TO MAKE A FILM 
AND WITH THAT FILM BEGIN TO RAISE A DISCUSSION 
DEAR SIR I AM SEEKING EMPLOYMENT AS AN ENGINEER ON ONE OF YOUR HOME TRADE 
WHEN I STARTED IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR THIS RIVER WAS CHOC A BLOC WITH SHIPS 
THE COAL TRADE YOU KNOW THE TYNE WAS BUILT FROM COAL 
WITH THE COAL WENT THE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS' 
CONSEQUENTLY IN THE SIXTIES WHEN THE COAL TRADE STARTED TO DIE OFF 
THERE WAS NO REPLACEMENT TRADE 
THERE WAS A BOAT LEFT OF KIRKCALDY EVERY WEEK AND CAME DOWN HERE WITH SIX TO SEVEN HUNDRED TONNES 
THIS WAS ALIVE WITH BUSINESS 
IT WAS ALWAYS FULL OF SHIPS' 
WHAT WE DID WAS WE MADE THE FILM 
THE B. B. C. BECAME INTERESTED IN IT 
HAVING DOCUMENTED WHAT THE QUAYSIDE WAS LIKE 
WE GOT INVOLVED WITH THE TIMES ARCHITECTURAL CORRESPONDENT CAME TO THE DEBATE I REMEMBER 
AND HE WAS APPALLED TO DISCOVER THE PLANS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE QUAYSIDE 
SO CONSEQUENTLY WE HAD A MYSTERIOUS PHONE CALL SAYING YOU CAN LIST ANY BUILDING YOU WANT 
HERE'S THE PHONE NUMBER OF THE DOE THEY'LL LIST ANY BUILDING YOU SAY 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE BEGAN TO DO 
FANTASTIC SO WHAT FORM DID THE FILM TAKE 
DID YOU WANT TO SORT OF IGNITE A LOT OF DEBATE AND SPARK OFF INTEREST 
YES I THINK FIRST OF ALL WE SET OUT TO MAKE A POETIC DOCUMENTARY 
SHORT SIXTY MILLIMETRE BLACK AND WHITE FILM 
WHICH RECORDED OR EXPRESSED IN A WAY WHAT WE FELT ABOUT THE QUAYSIDE ABOUT THE AREA 
AND WE FELT IF YOU DID IT IN THAT WAY 
AT LEAST THEN YOU CAN HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION 
YOU'RE NOT TELLING PEOPLE WHAT TO THINK YOU'RE NOT TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO 
SO WE DECIDED ON A VERY SIMPLE FORM 
WE GOT A REAR ENGINED CAR TOOK THE BONNET OFF 
PUT THE CAMERAMAN UNDER THE BONNET AND WE DROVE AROUND THE QUAYSIDE 
SO A LOT OF SHOTS SHOW YOU DRIVING STRAIGHT UP TO SOMEBODY 
AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON 
THERE'S A HUGE NUMBER OF TRACKING SHOTS THE FILM WAS ALMOST CONTINUOUS MOVEMENT 
WE ALSO HAD IN TANGENT WITH THIS FILM DONE PHOTOGRAPHY 
TWO GREAT PHOTOGRAPHERS WORKED WITH US 
THEY DOCUMENTED ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO WORKED ON THE QUAYSIDE 
SO WE HAD A COMPLETE RECORD BRILLIANT 
SO WE DID AN EXHIBITION AND WE DID THE FILM AND WITH THAT 
WE BEGAN TO RAISE THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO THIS AREA 
AND THAT OF COURSE THEN LED TO THE IDEA OF 
SHOULD THE COUNCIL BE KNOCKING IT DOWN IT REVEALED THAT 
AND GATESHEAD COUNCILLORS HAVE TOLD ME SINCE THAT IF THEY'D HAVE KNOCKED THE QUAYSIDE DOWN 
YOU COULDN'T HAVE HAD THE BALTIC YOU COULDN'T HAVE HAD THE SAGE 
BECAUSE IT'S PART OF A WHOLE FEELING OF AN AREA YEAH 
SO IF YOU MAKE THOSE MISTAKES YOU CAN NEVER RETRIEVE THEM 
WELL YOU'VE SEEN YOURSELF THE ARCHITECTURE CHANGE 
AND THE SUPERSTRUCTURE OF THE BUILDINGS 
WHAT ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND THE POPULATION HAS THAT DEMISED 
WELL YES I MEAN WHEN WE FIRST CAME IN THE LATE SIXTIES EARLY SEVENTIES 
THERE WERE STILL THE VESTIGES OR THE REMNANTS OF AN INDUSTRY 
YOU HAD SAIL MAKERS YOU HAD SHIPPING CLERKS YOU HAD COAL IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS 
ALL THAT'S GONE THERE'S VERY LITTLE OF THAT INDUSTRY LEFT 
NOW IT'S DRIVEN MUCH MORE BY TOURISM BY LEISURE BY THE IDEA OF THE CONTINENTAL CAFES 
YOU CAN SEE IF YOU GO OUTSIDE EVERYBODY IS SITTING AROUND AT TABLES IN THE SUN 
IT'S HAD THIS RADICAL CHANGE AND I THINK THAT'S INEVITABLE 
I THINK ALMOST EVERY CITY HAS HAD SOME SORT OF ATTEMPT TO REVITALISE 
WHAT'S LUCKY ABOUT IT IS YOU'VE GOT THE RIVER 
RIVERS ARE VERY ATTRACTIVE YOU KNOW PEOPLE COME BACK TO NEWCASTLE 
TO SEE THE BRIDGES AND YOU GET THIS OF BUZZ AND IT'S VISUALLY STUNNING 
IT'S SURVIVING PARTLY BECAUSE OF THIS GREAT VICTORIAN LEGACY THAT IS HERE 
AND I THINK IF THAT HAD GONE I HATE TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED 
TO THE QUAYSIDE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OFFICE BLOCKS 
YES AND BORING 
SO WHATEVER ONE THINKS ABOUT IT I HAVE MY OWN LIKES AND DISLIKES 
AT LEAST MOST OF THE BUILDINGS WERE SAVED 
AND IT'S GOT A GREAT FEELING A GREAT VITALITY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'VE HAD A GREAT TIME 
I LOVE THE FILM AND IT'S GUYS LIKE YOU AND THE CINEMA PROJECT HERE THAT HAVE REALLY NOT JUST RECORDED 
THE SOCIAL HISTORY HERE BUT YOU'VE ALSO HELPED PRESERVE IT SO THAT'S A GOOD THING 
NOW BACK TO THE VALUATION DAY WHERE ANITA'S FOUND SOMETHING FROM CLOSE TO HOME 
DAWN WELCOME TO FLOG IT 
AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BONNY ITEM ALONG 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS 
A PAISLEY SHAWL BUT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ITS ORIGIN 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE PAISLEY IS 
I DON'T NO YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE PAISLEY IS 
PAISLEY IS A TOWN JUST OUTSIDE GLASGOW 
NOW THIS IS A LOVELY ITEM MADE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THEY CAME FROM KASHMIR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE EARLY EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS 
AND IT BECAME THE MOST WONDERFUL FASHION ACCESSORY 
WOMEN WORE THEM AS THEY WOULD AN OVERCOAT ROUND THEIR BIG DRESSES 
THEY WERE MADE ALL OVER EUROPE 
BUT THE VERY BEST OF THEM DAWN WAS MADE IN PAISLEY NEAR GLASGOW 
AND THESE PEOPLE FROM PAISLEY USED TO TRAVEL DOWN TO LONDON 
TO SEE THE BOATS COMING IN SO THAT THEY COULD STEAL THE LATEST KASHMIRI DESIGNS 
ANYWAY LET'S HAVE A CLOSER LOOK AT IT 
LET'S STAND UP HERE 
LET'S OPEN IT UP AND SHOW IT IN ITS FULL GLORY OH LOOK AT THAT 
THESE WONDERFUL COLOURS THE REDS ORANGES YELLOWS AND BROWNS 
AND THESE STYLISED LEAF SHAPES HERE DO YOU LIKE IT DAWN 
YEAH I LOVE IT THE DETAIL'S REALLY DETAILED AND IT'S LOVELY 
BECAUSE IT'S MACHINE MADE 
IT'S NOT AS VALUABLE AS THE ONES WHICH WERE HAND MADE THE EARLIER ONES 
SO I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP MY ESTIMATE IN THE REGION OF SAY SIXTY TO EIGHTY 
RIGHT WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO SELL IT YEAH 
IT'S STILL ENOUGH MONEY TO BE ABLE TO PUT TOWARDS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO 
YEAH IT IS O. K. LET'S PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE 
ISN'T THAT GORGEOUS 
IT'S SO RICH AND EXOTIC 
BUT NOT YOUR STYLE TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT THIS LOVELY ITEM 
IT ACTUALLY BELONGED TO MY GRANDMOTHER AND IT WAS PASSED DOWN TO ME BY MY MAM 
BUT YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR REASON FOR SELLING IT 
YEAH I'M GONNA PUT THE MONEY TOWARDS A HORSEBOX 
TELL ME YOUR HORSE'S NAME DAWN SHE'S CALLED PANDORA'S LEGEND AH 
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME 
IS SHE SOME SPECIAL TYPE OF HORSE 
SHE IS SHE'S AN ANGLO ARAB SHE'S A SHOW JUMPER DO YOU JUMP WITH HER AS WELL 
YEAH I DO SO THE MONEY IS GOING TO SOMETHING THAT WILL SUIT YOUR LIFESTYLE YES 
O. K. SO SIXTY TO EIGHTY WITH SAY A RESERVE OF AROUND FIFTY FIVE 
RIGHT DO YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT ABOUT THAT 
YEAH WELL WE'LL PUT IT TO AUCTION I'LL BE THERE WITH YOU 
AND I REALLY HOPE THAT IT DOES WELL SO THAT PANDORA'S 
LEGEND LEGEND WILL BE HAPPY IN HER NEW HORSEBOX 
WE'VE GOT A LOVELY LITTLE COLLECTION HERE 
DID THIS ALL COME FROM THE SAME PLACE 
NO IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY 
FIRST OF ALL THIS LITTLE TRIO 
OF THE PLATE 
AND THE SAUCER AND THE CUP 
I WAS AT AN ANTIQUES FAIR IN YORK 
AND THEY JUST SORT OF JUMPED OUT AT ME 
I THINK THIS LOVELY HORSE MOVEMENT AND THE RED AND WHITE ALSO COS I MUST ADMIT 
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE IN NEWCASTLE I AM A SUNDERLAND SUPPORTER 
THE RED AND WHITE SORT OF JUMPED AT YOU VERY MUCH SO 
AND I HAD THEM IN MY KITCHEN I LOVE THEM A LOT 
AND THEN A FEW YEARS LATER I WAS IN AN ANTIQUES FAIR IN GATESHEAD 
AND SURPRISE SURPRISE 
I SAW THE SAME PATTERN AND IT JUMPED OUT AT ME AGAIN AND SO I BOUGHT IT IN TWO SECTIONS 
AND YOU LIKE THE HORSE PATTERN AS WELL 
IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF IT 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S A BIT ABSTRACT BUT IT JUST CAUGHT THE EYE 
I CAN SEE WHAT YOU MEAN COS IF WE JUST LOOK AT THE SAUCER HERE 
THE WAY THAT THE TWO HORSES ARE SORT OF ON TOP OF EACH OTHER 
TO SUGGEST THAT MOVEMENT 
FROM ONE POSITION TO THE OTHER IS RATHER NICE ISN'T IT 
THE LEGS ARE ALMOST THEY'RE SORT OF VERY SHARP 
AND YOU CAN GET THE IDEA OF A PLUNGING FORWARD MOVEMENT YES 
AND A LITTLE BIT GREEK PERHAPS LIKE THE ANCIENT GREEK ARTWORK 
YES ABSOLUTELY SO THAT'S WHAT APPEALED 
IT DID AND IT WAS JUST THE PATTERN I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT 
WHAT DID YOU PAY CAN YOU REMEMBER 
I CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER BUT I THINK PROBABLY BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN 
FOR THE PAIR OF THOSE TOGETHER 
COS OF COURSE BESWICK WHICH IS WHAT IT IS 
ALL THE PIECES ARE MARKED ON THE BOTTOM BESWICK ENGLAND 
IS STILL FAIRLY AFFORDABLE IN UTILITARIAN PIECES LIKE THIS 
AND IT'S THE PATTERN OR THE DESIGNER AND THE SHAPE OF THE PIECE 
THAT ARE ALL FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE PRICE TODAY AT AUCTION 
AND I HAVE TO SAY I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE TOAST RACK 
I THINK THIS IS SUCH A GREAT SHAPE AND VERY RETRO IN STYLE TODAY AND VERY COMMERCIAL TODAY 
VERY POPULAR SO THAT'S THE TOAST RACK 
THE JAM POT HAS SOME STAINING ON THE LID HERE WHICH DOES AFFECT IT A LITTLE BIT 
BUT OTHERWISE IT'S QUITE GOOD ISN'T IT 
NO BAD CRACKS TO THE POT THERE 
WELL THE DESIGNER WAS A CHAP CALLED ALBERT HALLAM AND IN FACT HE WAS BEST KNOWN 
FOR THE ZEBRA DESIGN WHICH IS FAIRLY COMMON ON BESWICK TEA WARE 
THE STRIPED PATTERN VERY STRIKING 
BUT HE ALSO DESIGNED THIS PATTERN WITH THE HORSES 
AND THIS PARTICULAR PATTERN WAS INTRODUCED IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX 
IN ITS FIRST VERSION 
SO WE'RE BANG IN THAT PERIOD AND I WOULD GIVE IT AN ESTIMATE CERTAINLY AS A COLLECTION 
OF FIFTY TO SEVENTY AND I THINK A SENSIBLE RESERVE WOULD BE FORTY FIVE AS THE BOTTOM LINE FOR YOU 
THAT'D BE NICE YES YES THANK YOU 
SO YOU'RE NOT SAD TO SEE IT GO 
NO ALTHOUGH I LOVE THE PATTERN 
BUT IT IS SITTING IN A BOX IN MY HOUSE AND IT ISN'T BEING USED 
AND SO PERHAPS SOMEBODY ELSE WILL BE ATTRACTED TO IT AND WILL LOVE IT 
MORE THAN I AM AT PRESENT PERHAPS 
LESLEY THIS IS A LOVELY BLACKCURRANT SWEETIE I LOVE IT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS 
I BELIEVE IT'S A WHITEFRIARS VASE TELL ME WHERE DID YOU GET IT 
I BOUGHT IT AS A WEDDING ANNIVERSARY PRESENT FOR MY PARENTS IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES YOU'RE A WOMAN OF TASTE 
YOU ARE A WOMAN DID YOU PAY A LOT OF MONEY AT THE TIME 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A LOT OF MONEY 
BUT IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE THAN A FIVER I DON'T THINK 
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IT WAS A GOOD BUY WAS IT OH GOOD 
IT WAS A GOOD BUY 
NOW IT IS WHITEFRIARS ONE OF THE PRESTIGIOUS GLASSMAKERS 
THEY ALWAYS MADE ITEMS OF QUALITY 
NOT ONLY DID THEY MAKE QUALITY PRODUCTS THEY EMPLOYED THE BEST OF DESIGNERS 
O. K. AND THIS VASE WAS DESIGNED BY A CHAP CALLED GEOFFREY BAXTER 
WHO WAS ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS DESIGNERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
THIS IS WHAT IS HOT

NOW PRICE WISE YOU PAID A FIVER FOR IT LESLEY 
ABOUT THAT YEAH IF I OFFERED YOU A FIVER FOR IT NOW WOULD YOU TAKE IT

DO YOU HAVE IT ON DISPLAY

SO IT'S DOING NOTHING NO WELL IN THAT CASE IT'S TIME TO PASS IT ON 
I WOULD ESTIMATE IT IN THE REGION OF FIVE HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED HOW MUCH 
FIVE HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED WELL I'M VERY VERY SURPRISED IT'S AS MUCH AS THAT

OF MONEY BUT VERY NICE A VERY NICE SURPRISE YES 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY WITH IT SELLING AT THAT PRICE 
I'M SURE YES VERY HAPPY 
YEAH WELL IT MAY GO HIGHER 
THERE IS ONE OF THIS DESIGN WHICH IS AN ORANGE COLOUR
