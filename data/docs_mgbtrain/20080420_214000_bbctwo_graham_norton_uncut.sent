COS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE KEVIN YOU STAYED IN A HORRIBLE HOTEL 
LAST TIME I WAS HERE TO SHOOT A MOVIE 
AND THEY SHOWED ME PICTURES OF THE HOTEL THEY WERE GONNA PUT ME IN 
IT WAS KIND OF HARD FROM THE PICTURE IT LOOKED O. K. 
THEY TOLD ME I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW LONDON THAT WELL BEEN A COUPLE OF TIMES 
THEY TOLD ME IT WAS IN NOTTING HILL WHICH OF COURSE 
TO AN AMERICAN THAT SOUNDS GOOD WHATEVER NOTTING HILL 
VERY NICE FILM YEAH NICE FILM AND YOU KNOW 
ACTUALLY WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS A NEIGHBOURHOOD CALLED SHEPHERD'S BUSH 
I WAS PICTURING THE SHEPHERD AND PICTURING HIS BUSH 
IT WASN'T REALLY WHAT I EXPECTED NO 
I CHECKED INTO THE HOTEL AND I GOT TO THE ROOM IT WAS ONE OF THESE HOTELS LIKE REAL SUPER SLEEK 
KIND OF A SEXY LOOK KIND OF A NEW IDEA ABOUT HOTELS WHERE YOU HAVE BIG FLAT SCREEN T. V.'S 
EVERYTHING'S VERY MINIMALIST BLACK AND WHITE AND I WAS LIKE 
THIS IS ALL RIGHT NO VIEW BUT I CAN DEAL WITH IT 
I SAID CAN I TAKE A WALK THEY SAID MAYBE DON'T WALK AROUND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD 
I LOOKED AND THEY HAD THIS THING CALLED AN AMENITIES DRAWER 
AND IN IT WAS TOOTHPASTE AND COMBS AND STUFF THAT YOU MIGHT NEED 
YOU KNOW SEWING KIT 
AND NEXT TO THE AMENITIES DRAWER WAS SOMETHING CALLED 
THE SMUT DRAWER AND I OPEN UP THE SMUT DRAWER AND IN IT WERE HANDCUFFS 
PORN 
AND SOMETHING I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE OR SINCE CALLED BANANA DICK LICK OIL 
EVEN I TONY EVEN I HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT 
IT'S NOT MY IDEA OF WHAT LONDON IS SUPPOSED TO BE SO I MOVED 
THIS TIME NO BANANA DICK LICK OIL THIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS 
I SAID IN THE INTRODUCTION THERE TONY THAT YOU'D SLEPT WITH OVER A THOUSAND WOMEN 
WHAT 
THIS IS WHAT I READ YOU'VE SLEPT WITH OVER A THOUSAND WOMEN IS THAT RIGHT 
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK SO YES 
COS BACK IN THE DAY WASN'T THERE A THING WHERE THEY HAD IN THE STUDIOS THEY HAD FENCING INSTRUCTORS 
YES YOU'D APPROACH THE STARLET AND TELL THEM THAT YOU WERE AN INSTRUCTOR ALSO 
YES I WOULD TELL THEM I'M AN ACTING INSTRUCTOR AND HOW TO RELEASE YOURSELF IN A KISS 
HOW MANY OF YOU GUYS HAVE SAID THAT 
IN THE BACK SEAT OF A CAR 
I WOULD PUT A GIRL AT EASE THAT WAY 
DID THAT WORK 
IT CERTAINLY DID 
AND BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN MOVIES WERE SUPPOSED TO BE VERY CHASTE AND ONE LEG ON THE FLOOR AND ALL THAT 
WAS IT ALL VERY LIP ON LIP ACTION 
NOT NECESSARILY DEPENDING ON THE GIRL YES 
I WAS ALWAYS VERY CHASTE WE WERE ALWAYS VERY KIND AND DIDN'T WANT TO CREATE ANY PROBLEMS 
YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO TONGUE WORK 
NONE AT ALL 
AND I WOULD WAIT FOR SOME INDICATION 
FROM THE GIRL THAT I WAS WITH OF WHAT SHE EXPECTED 
I DID 
IN OTHER WORDS YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE YOUR TIME BEFORE YOU SLIP THEM THE GOLDFISH 
SO YOU WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND YOU WOULDN'T GO 
A TONGUE MEETING YEAH ARE WE GONNA DO THIS WITH THE FAMILY 
ROUND THE TABLE YES 
BECAUSE YOU DID APPARENTLY BED SOME LEADING LADIES ALONG THE WAY YES 
VERY FAMOUSLY MARILYN MONROE YES 
THERE YOU ARE KISSING HER THE LAST TIME YOU WERE ON THE SHOW YOU TOLD A VERY FUNNY STORY 
I THINK YOU WERE IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE AND YOU WERE IN A MEN'S TOILET 
DO YOU REMEMBER THIS STORY GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE 
YOU WERE IN MEN'S TOILETS AND A MAN OH YES 
I REMEMBER HIS NAME WAS HABIBI HE WAS FROM EGYPT 
AND HE WORKED FOR ALL THE SHEIKS 
HE WOULD PICK UP GIRLS FOR THEM AND SEND THEM OFF 
AND WE BECAME GOOD FRIENDS 
IT WAS KIND OF NICE I ENJOYED HIS COMPANY 
AND WE WERE SITTING IN THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOTEL 
AND HAVING A DRINK AND I SAID TO HIM 
I GOT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS HE SAID LET ME TAKE YOU 
I SAID O. K. SO WE GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I GO TO A ONE OF THOSE URINALS 
AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THAT IN ENGLAND YES AND MORE 
URINAL 
AND I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF 
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO URINATE 
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE IT OUT 
AND THERE I AM AND I SEE HABIBI WHO'S LOOKING OVER THIS PARTITION 
LOOKING DOWN AND UP AT ME DOWN 
WELL I'M FAMOUS SO IF YOU WANTED TO SEE IT YOU COULD LOOK AT IT 
YOU CAN'T LOOK AT IT NO IT'S CRUDE AND VULGAR 
SO I LET HIM LOOK AT IT FINALLY HE SAYS TO ME 
DID YOU MAKE LOVE TO MARILYN MONROE I SAID YES I DID 
HE SAID WELL MAY I KISS IT 
I SAID NO YOU CANNOT KISS IT I'M GOING STEADY 
I DON'T DO THAT FOR ANYONE 
I LOVE THAT STORY 
DO YOU THINK IT'S TRUE THAT THEY'RE SAYING THERE'S A SEX TAPE 
IN FACT THEY'VE SOLD IT DID YOU READ THIS THERE'S A SEX TAPE OF MARILYN I READ ABOUT IT 
THEY SOLD IT FOR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
WHICH IS I THINK THREE MILLION DOLLARS 
WHEN WAS THIS A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO YES IT'S HER AND AN UNIDENTIFIED MAN TONY H. M. M. AS YET 
OH DEAR 
BUT IT SEEMS VERY ODD BECAUSE NOW IT'S SO EASY TO MAKE A SEX TAPE 
COS OF VIDEO CAMERAS BUT BACK THEN YOU'D NEED LIKE A CAMERA FILM 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD YOU'D NEED A WHOLE CREW YEAH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO DO 
HAIR IN THE GATE 
APPARENTLY YOU CAN TELL IT'S OLD BECAUSE IT'S ALL BLACK AND WHITE SORT OF SILENT MOVIE 
AND IN THE FILM YOU CAN SEE MARILYN GIVING ORAL SEX TO SOME MAN 
AND IN THE BACKGROUND LAUREL AND HARDY ARE DELIVERING A PIANO 
OH DEAR 
I KNOW IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT WE'VE GOT LOTS OF YOUR FANS AND LOTS OF KEVIN'S FANS 
AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS CONTACTING VARIOUS FAN CLUBS AROUND THE WORLD 
AND WE FOUND THAT SOME OF YOUR FANS IN PARTICULAR KEVIN ARE A BIT MENTAL 
A RESEARCHER ON THE SHOW 
DAVE WHERE'S DAVE THERE'S DAVE DRESSED UP SPECIAL 
NOW HE GOT TO AN INTERESTING SITE THERE'S A GROUP IN MICHIGAN CALLED 
THE MILLION STRONG FOR KEVIN BACON ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THIS GROUP NO 
SO DAVE THINKING HE'S BEING NICE HE WENT TO THE WEBSITE THINKING HE WAS BEING NICE 
WELL HE WAS BEING NICE 
SO HE JUST SAYS HI I WORK FOR BLAH BLAH WE'RE MAKING THE GRAHAM NORTON SHOW 
AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR KEVIN BACON FANS TO JOIN OUR AUDIENCE IT'LL BE REALLY GOOD FUN 
HE MAY HAVE OVERSTATED THAT 
SO CHRISTOPHER BADGLEY WRITES 
SORRY DAVE I'D NEVER BE PART OF A SHOW THAT EMPLOYS PEOPLE WHO SPELL PROGRAMME WITH AN EXTRA M. AND E. 
YEAH BABY OH YEAH 
CHRISTOPHER'S ALL OVER MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY ALL RIGHT 
SPELL IT THE ENGLISH WAY 
ANYWAY THEN IT GOES FROM BAD TO WORSE 
IT'LL BE REALLY GOOD FUN JARED GOES 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT DAVE IF THAT'S YOUR REAL NAME 
THE KEVIN BACON SUPPORT GROUP WILL MOST DEFINITELY ATTEND ONE OF THESE PROGRAMMES 
IF IT'S LOCATED IN THE U. S. A. PREFERABLY MICHIGAN 
AND IF YOU SUPPLY PEOPLE WITH POPSICLES AND OUR CHOICE OF A FORTY O. Z. BOTTLE OF MALT LIQUOR 
YEAH BABY THAT'S MY FANS 
A LOLLIPOP AND A FORTY I LIKE THAT 
BUT THEN AGAIN WE GO BACK TO POOR DAVE SAYING 
IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME TO THE SHOW IT MIGHT BE FUN THAT'S ALL HE SAID 
ANDY ROBINSON FUCKING BRITS 
THEIR ANTI KEVIN BACONESS KNOWS NO BOUNDS 
THEY WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO DESTROY HIM 
I HAVE STARTED A CAMPAIGN TO DUMP A BUNCH OF TEA AND BEATLES ALBUMS 
AND SHAUN OF THE DEAD D. V. D. S. INTO LAKE MICHIGAN 
IS THAT FOR REAL I SWEAR TO GOD HE OBVIOUSLY LOGGED OFF AND THOUGHT NO I HAVEN'T SAID ENOUGH 
HE GOES BACK ON I THOUGHT YOU FUCKERS LEARNED YOUR LESSON 
WHEN WE KICKED YOUR ASS IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR 
DON'T TREAD ON ME DAVE DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT TREADING ON K. B. 
I'LL KILL YOUR REDCOAT ASS MYSELF 
LET IT GO LET IT GO 
NO I SWEAR GENUINELY 
I SWEAR TO GOD 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY NO BAD FANS AS LONG AS THEY'RE FANS 
AND ON THE INTERNET AND ON THE INTERNET IN MICHIGAN 
DID THE STUDIO ORGANISE THE FANS IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN TO CHASE YOU FOR THE PRESS 
I THINK THEY USED TO 
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE STUDIOS WERE A MAJOR ENTITY OF FILM MAKING 
AND PEOPLE WERE UNDER CONTRACT TO A STUDIO 
AND IN ORDER TO GENERATE SOME INFORMATION THEY WOULD ORGANISE THINGS LIKE THAT 
SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS I THINK THAT STILL GOES ON DOES IT REALLY 
I THINK SO YES I REALLY DO 
THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO SET UP SITUATIONS SO THAT THEY CAN GET OUT THERE 
COS FAME IS AN ADDICTIVE THING IF YOU DON'T SEE YOUR PICTURE IN THE PAPER FOR A LONG TIME 
YOU START TO THINK HEY WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME THEY'RE NOT TAKING MY PICTURE 
IS IT TRUE THEY MADE YOU A SPECIAL SUIT TONY YES 
THEY WOULD MAKE ME SUITS THAT WHEN YOU PULLED THE SLEEVE IT'D COME OFF 
THEY'D SEND ME ON THE ROAD TO DO THAT 
IT'S WONDERFUL BEING WITH YOU AND YOU LIKE WISE AND WITH THIS AUDIENCE 
LOVELY TO HAVE YOU BOTH HERE 
LISTEN WE'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT ACTING OBVIOUSLY COS YOU'RE TWO GREAT ACTORS 
YOU'VE BOTH SUFFERED FOR YOUR ART 
NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TERMS LIKE METHOD AND EVERYTHING BUT PHYSICALLY 
YOU'VE REALLY PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE FOR ROLES 
IS IT APOLLO THIRTEEN YOU DID THE WEIGHTLESSNESS 
YEAH WE DID WEIGHTLESSNESS IN THE VOMIT COMET 
A K. C. ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE AEROPLANE THAT NASA USES 
TO TRAIN ASTRONAUTS IN WEIGHTLESSNESS 
ALTHOUGH MANY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS THERE IS NOTHING LIKE AN ANTI GRAVITY CHAMBER 
YOU CAN'T GET RID OF GRAVITY ON EARTH SO THEY GO OUT FLY OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO 
AND THEY CLIMB IN A SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN THEN THEY DIVE AND CLIMB AND DIVE 
AS THEY GO OVER THE TOP OF THE DIVE THERE'S A BALANCE BETWEEN THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE THROWING YOU UP 
AND LITERALLY AND THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL AND YOU FLOAT FOR TWENTY FIVE SECONDS 
SO WE EXPERIENCED THAT ONCE IN ORDER TO GET READY TO DO THE MOVIE 
TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE IN WEIGHTLESSNESS 
BUT THE DIRECTOR DECIDED THAT RON HOWARD DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE FUN TO SHOOT UP THERE 
SO THEY GOT PERMISSION FROM NASA AND WE BUILT THE SETS IN THE FUSELAGE OF THE PLANE 
AND WE DID IT FOR LIKE SIX HUNDRED TIMES 
THEY CALL IT THE VOMIT COMET BECAUSE IF YOU'RE PRONE TO THAT KIND OF THING 
IT'S INCREDIBLY NAUSEATING AND DID YOU I NEVER PUKED 
BECAUSE I WAS TAKING SOME REALLY REALLY SERIOUS ANTI NAUSEA DRUGS 
I LITERALLY ALMOST HAD TO GO TO BETTY FORD ONCE THE MOVIE WAS OVER 
TO DETOX COS THE STUFF WE WERE TAKING 
WAS A COMBINATION OF A REALLY SERIOUS DOWN THAT MAKES YOU NOT THROW UP 
AND SO YOU'RE NOT ASLEEP THE WHOLE DAY YOU TAKE SPEEDS IT'S LIKE A COCKTAIL OF THAT 
I SHALL WATCH THE FILM AGAIN WITH INTEREST 
DID IT HELP YOU IN ANY WAY IT HELPED YES I WAS FINE 
IT CLEARED YOUR MIND IN A WAY YOU KNOW 
BEING UP THERE IN THAT SITUATION 
KNOWING THAT YOU'RE EITHER HEADING STRAIGHT UP OR HURTLING TO THE EARTH 
IT CLEARS YOUR MIND QUICKLY ANYWAY BUT ERM 
I DID GET THROWN UP ON BY A CAMERAMAN THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THROWING UP IN ZERO G. 
IS THAT YOU THROW UP AND THE VOMIT DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE IT JUST KIND OF FLOATS 
EURGH 
SO GET OUT OF THE WAY EXACTLY 
SO I WAS LIKE THIS IN THE THING AND THE GUY WAS HOLING THE CAMERA 
AND HE PUKED AND I WAS LIKE THERE'S NOTHING I CAN REALLY DO ABOUT IT 
AND WHEN WE HIT THE GRAVITY IT JUST YOU KNOW LANDED RIGHT ON ME 
OH THEY CLEANED ME UP AND WE LIVED TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY 
THAT MUST BE HORRIBLE KNOWING IT'S COMING HERE IT COMES 
YOU TOO HAVE HAD VERY PHYSICALLY DEMANDING ROLES 
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WAS KIND OF YOUR MOST DEMANDING 
TRAPEZE HOW MUCH OF THAT DID YOU ACTUALLY DO I DID SEVENTY PER CENT OF IT ALL 
I DID ALL THE GROUND TUMBLING AND SOME OF THE FLYING STUFF 
BUT YOU KNOW I FIND I LIKE TO DO IT YOU GOTTA DO IT YOU KNOW 
YOU GOTTA DO AS MUCH AS YOU CAN OR AS MUCH AS THEY'LL LET YOU DO 
THAT'S THE TREAT TO LEARN SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY YOU NEVER KNEW HOW TO DO 
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN THAT PHYSICALLY HOW HARD WAS IT IN SOME LIKE IT HOT 
DOING THE WHOLE DRESSING UP AS A WOMAN THING 
YOU GOTTA HAVE SPECIAL KIND OF PANTS 
SO THERE WAS NO WAY THAT ANYONE COULD DOUBT THE FACT THAT YOU WEREN'T A MAN 
AH I CAN'T REALLY GO INTO DETAILS ABOUT THAT 
BUT IF YOU WANNA MEET ME OUTSIDE THE THEATRE 
I'LL TELL YOU A BOOK NOW UNBELIEVABLY SOME LIKE IT HOT IT'S IS IT FIFTY YEARS NEXT YEAR 
IT WAS FIFTY NINE WASN'T IT SO FIFTY EIGHT 
FIFTY EIGHT SO IT'S THIS YEAR IT'S FIFTY YEARS THIS YEAR 
IS IT FIFTY YEARS IT'S TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NOW WOW YE AH 
FIFTY YEARS THAT'S INCREDIBLE ISN'T IT 
AND THAT'S WELL YOU KNOW WE SEE OURSELVES 
WHEN WE'RE KIDS 
WHATEVER AGE WE ARE WHEN WE MAKE IT 
TWENTY TWO MINUTES LATER YOU'RE OLDER 
I'M TAPING THE SHOW I'LL GET IT LATER NOW 
TALKING OF MEN BEING WOMEN COS I STILL HOLD THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
THIS STORY HAS RUMBLED ON FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS ALL RIGHT 
THIS IS THE STORY OF THOMAS BEATIE 
THE MAN WHO'S SIX MONTHS PREGNANT I'M SURE YOU'VE YES

HE STARTED OUT AS A WOMAN APPARENTLY HE STILL IS 
WELL IT ANSWERS A LOT OF QUESTIONS DOESN'T IT

IT'S A LOVELY STORY DISNEY ARE PROBABLY QUEUING UP TO BUY THE RIGHTS TO THIS ONE 
WHEN HE DECIDED TO LIVE AS A MAN THOMAS BEATIE DIDN'T CHANGE HIS SEXUAL ORGANS 
WHICH IS KIND OF THE MAIN POINT ISN'T IT IF YOU'RE A WOMAN AND YOU JUST DRESS LIKE A MAN 
ESSENTIALLY THAT'S JUST BEING A LESBIAN ISN'T IT 
I KNOW HE'S GOT A BEARD AND ARMPIT HAIR BUT THAT'S BEING A WELSH LESBIAN I THINK 
HE TOLD ONE NEWSPAPER 
OF COURSE IT IS IT'S SAYING 
I'M NOT EVEN BORN AND YOU'VE RUINED MY LIFE 
IT'S A CRAZE NOW JUST THIS WEEKEND I SAW A PICTURE IN THE PAPERS OF A BRITISH MAN WHO IS PREGNANT
