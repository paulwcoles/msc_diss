GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO THE BRO 
GRAEME IT'S MONDAY NINETEENTH OF MAY A 
WEEK AFTER DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE 
CHINA BEGINS THREE DAYS OF MOURNING 
AS HOPE OF FINDING MORE SURVIVORS 
NOW FADES 
GOOD MORNING FROM THE STOCK 
EXCHANGE I'VE GOT MORE GRIM NEWS 
ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET DETAILS 
AT QUARTER PAST 
SCARLIKEEKEEKEE DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF 
THESE BEFORE SCARLIKEEKEEKEE 
THOUGHT A PINT OF BEER WAS TWO 
GLASS OF WIN WAS ONE

YOUR LIMITS A NEW CAMPAIGN WARNS 
OF THE DANGERS OF DRINKING YOURSELF

WEATHER FOR PERFECT GARDENS IT'S IT'S GARDENING FOR THE FUTURE AS 
CHELSEA GOES GREEN IN COLOUR AND 
CREDENTIALS WE'RE LIVE AMID THE 
SHOW GARDENS IN AROUND FIFTEEN MINUTES 
FIRST OUR MAIN STORY THIS MORNING 
M. P.'S VOTE TODAY ON WHETHER TO BAN 
RESEARCH ON SO CALLED HYBRID 
EMBRYOS PART HUMAN AND PART 
ANIMALS SCIENTISTS SAY THE WORK 
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM 
MILLIONS OF LIVES HELPING TO TREAT 
ALZHEIMER'S AND PARKIN SONS 
CRITICS SAY IT'S IMMORAL 
MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE IS ONE OF 
DOZENS OF CONDITIONS WHICH 
SCIENTISTS HOPE TO TARGET WITH 
HYBRID EMBRYO RESEARCH SEVEN 
MEMBERS OF LIZ SHIPLEY'S FAMILY 
HAVE DIED FROM THE DISEASE SHE 
HOPES THE WORK COULD HELP FUTURE 
GENERATIONS 
IF YOU WATCHED WHAT GENERATIONS MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE DOES TO 
PEOPLE THEN YOU WOULDN'T WANT THEM 
TO BAN THIS KIND OF TREATMENT 
NOBODY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SUFFER 
AND PUTTING IT BLUNTLY MOTOR 
NEURONE DISEASE IS A DEATH SENTENCE 
THESE ARE HYBRID EMBRYOS CREATED 
IN NEWCASTLE THEY'RE NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE PER CENT HUMAN 
BUT CONTAIN A TINY AMOUNT OF ANIMAL 
D. N. A. SCIENTISTS WANT TO EXTRACT 
STEM CELLS FROM THEM TO BETTER 
UNDERSTAND DISEASES LIKE PARKIN 
SONS AND ALZHEIMER'S BUT THIS 
CONSERVATIVE M. P. WILL BE ARGUING 
THAT HYBRID EMBRYO RESEARCH SHOULD 
BE BANNED OUTRIGHT 
THEY ARE CREATE 
BEING CREATING WHAT IS ETHICALLY 
QUITE WRONG SOMETHING WHICH IS 
ANIMAL AND HUMAN THAT GOES AGAINST 
EVERY KIND OF MORAL TEACHING THAT 
WE'VE EVER KNOWN 
INITIALLY THE 
GOVERNMENT OPPOSED HYBRID EMBRYOS 
BUT NOW MINISTERS SUPPORT THE 
RESEARCH SUBJECT TO STRICT CONTROLS 
LEADING MEDICAL BODIES INCLUDING 
SOME NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS SUPPORT 
THE CREATION OF HYBRID EMBRYOS 
TODAY IT WILL BE M. P.'S WHO DECIDE 
WHETHER THAT WORK SHOULD CONTINUE 
OR IF IT SHOULD BE BANNED 
M. P.'S ARE GOING TO BE DEBATING OTHER 
PARTS OF THE BILL AS WELL 
INCLUDING WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE A 
FATHER INVOLVED IN ANY COUPLE 
SEEKING I. V. F. TREATMENT WE SPEAK TO 
A WOMAN WHO WAS UNOF FIRST I. V. F. 
BABIES ABOUT THAT IN HALF AN HOUR 
A THREE DAY PERIOD OF NATIONAL 
MOURNING BEGINS IN CHINA TODAY A 
WEEK ON FROM WHEN THE DEVASTATING 
EARTHQUAKE STRUCK SOLDIERS SET THE 
FLAG AT HALF MAST IN TIANANMEN 
SQUARE AS A MARK OF RESPECT A 
THREE MINUTE SILENCE WILL BE HELD 
AT JUST BEFORE SEVEN THIRTY A M. U. K. TIME THE 
EXACT MOMENT THAT THE EARTHQUAKE 
HIT HIT WARNINGS ABOUT HOW MUCH ALCOHOL 
IT'S SAFE TO DRINK STILL DON'T SEEM 
TO BE GETTING THROUGH TO A LOT OF 
US SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THOSE QUESTIONED IN A 
SURVEY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 
COULDN'T SAY HOW MANY UNITS THERE 
WERE IN A G. L. S. OF WINE TODAY THE 
GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES A NEW CAREFUL 
DRINKING CAMPAIGN 
WHEN YOU GO OUT FOR A DRINK DO YOU 
KNOW HOW MUCH ALCOHOL YOU'RE 
HAVING WE'VE BEEN BOMBARDED WITH 
INFORMATION ABOUT ALCOHOL UNITS FOR 
YEARS BUT IT SEEMS AN AWFUL LOT OF 
US ARE STILL NOT GETTING THE 
MESSAGE HOW MANY UNITS DO YOU 
THINK THERE ARE IN THAT GLASS OF 
WINE THREE 
SCARLIKEEKEEKEE THINK WINE THREE THERE ARE TWO ONE 
AND THEY'RE NOT ONE THE ONLY ONES TO BE CONFUSED SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT 
OF THOSE ASKED DIDN'T REALISE THAT 
A LARGE GLASS OF WINE CONTAINED 
THREE UNITS TWO THIRDS DIDN'T 
REALISE A DOUBLE GIN AND TONIC IS 
TWO UNITS ONE THIRD DIDN'T KNOW AN 
AVERAGE PINT IS TWO UNITS AS WELL 
THIS ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN'S 
DESIGNED TO PUSH HOME THE SAFE 
DRINKING MESSAGE 
DID YOU KNOW THAT 
IF WOMEN REGULARLY EXCEED TWO TO 
THREE UNITS A DAY IT COULD ADD UP 
TO A SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEM SOME SOME QUESTION WHAT DIFFERENCE THE ADS 
MAKE 
THE YOUNG PEOPLE WE SPOKE TO MAKE IN OUR STUDY REPRESENT DRINKING AS 
BEING A VERY FUN ACTIVITY 
PARTICULARLY DRINKING TO THE POINT 
OF INTOXICATION COULD BE A LOT OF 
FUN THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE YOUNG 
PEOPLE WERE TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE 
UNITS THEY WERE DRINKING AND INDEED 
DRINK TO A POINT MONITORING YOUR 
DRINK ANYTHING THAT WAY WENT 
AGAINST THEIR OBJECTIVE WHICH WAS 
TO GET DRUNK 
WHEN WE SHOWED THE 
NEW ADS TO THESE DRINKERS IT DID 
HAVE AN IMPACT 
OH MY GOD YOU 
MIGHT AS WELL NOT EVEN DRINK 
SCARLIKEEKEEKEE DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF 
THESE BR SCARLIKEEKEEKEE THOUGHT A 
PINT OF BEER WAS TWO GLASS OF WINE 
WAS ONE MAYBE FIFTEEN TURNS OUT SOME 
OF THEM ARE UP TO THREE 
SCARLIKEEKEEKEE WOULD NEVER HAVE 
KNOWN THIS EVEN IF IT DOESN'T DO 
NOTHING AT LEAST YOU KNOW HOW HOW LONG WILL THEY REMEMBER THE SAFE 
DRINKING MESSAGE 
FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM SOUTH EAST 
ASIA ARE MEET ANYTHING SINGAPORE TO 
DISCUSS WAYS OF HELPING VICTIMS OF 
THE CYCLONE WHICH HIT TWO WEEKS 
AGO NOW THEY'RE HOPING THE BURMESE 
GENERALS WHO BLOCKED ALL BUT THE A 
FRACTION OF THE AID OFFERED SO FAR 
FIGHT ACCEPT HELP FROM THEIR 
NEIGHBOURS THE B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM 
REPORTING INSIDE BURMYA OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE NOW 
FROM NEIGHBOURING THAILAND GOOD 
MORNING WILL THE BURMESE 
LEADERSHIP BE THERE WILL THE ASIAN 
COUNTRIES BE TALK TO THEM OR WITH 
THEM 
THEY'LL BE TALKING WITH THEM THEM BURMA HAS SENT ITS FOREIGN MINISTER 
TO THIS MEETING THE PROBLEM IS IT 
REALLY WORKS BY CONSENSUS THE IDEA 
THEY'LL PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON 
THE BURMESE IS NOT REALLY THE WAY 
THINGS WORK WHAT THEY'LL BE HOPING 
IS THEY'LL HEAR FROM THE BURMESE 
FOREIGN MINISTER THE SITUATION ON 
THE GROUND AS FOR AS HE'S CONCERNED 
THEY'LL HOPE THAT THROUGH THEIR 
DISCUSSIONS THEY CAN TRY TO 
PERSUADE HIM TO ACCEPT SOME KIND OF 
AID EFFORT THE FOCUS SEEMS TO BE 
ON PERSUADING BURMA TO ACCEPT AID 
CHANNELED THROUGH ITS NEIGHBOURS 
BRITISH AID FOR EXAMPLE COMING 
THROUGH NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES AND 
BRANDED IF YOU LIKE AS ASYAN AID 
AND THE BURMESE ARE MORE LIKELY TO 
ACCEPT ACCEPT HELP FROM THEIR 
NEIGHBOURS RATHER THAN WHAT THEY 
SEE AS TOTAL STRANGERS INDEED INDEED THERE IS A CERTAIN SENSE OF 
PARANOIA IN THE REGIME AT MOTIVES 
FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD WHAT 
DIPLOMATS ARE HOPING THEY CAN 
PERSUADE THE GENERALS IS THAT THE 
MOTIVES ARE HUMANITARIAN AND NOT 
POLITICAL THERE ARE OTHER 
IMPORTANT DIPLOMATIC MOVES GOING ON 
TODAY JOHN HOLMES THE TOP UN 
OFFICIAL IS TOURING THE IRRAWADDY 
DELTA THE WORST AFFECTED REGIONS

NATIONWIDE BACK TO WORK PROGRAMME 
NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS UNLESS LOTS 
OF NEW JOB IS CREATED IN SOUTH 
WALES NORTH EAST ENGLAND AND PARTS 
OF SCOTLAND THE GOVERNMENT IS 
UNLIKELY TO GET MORE THAN HALF A 
MILLION BACK TO WORK 
WE HAVE TO 
HELP THE INDIVIDUALS WHICH IS WHAT 
THE GOVERNMENT IS INCREASINGLY 
INCLINED TO DO THAT INVOLVES 
RETRAINING PHYSICAL REHABILITATION 
WE HAVE TO GROW THE LOCAL ECONOMIES 
WHERE THE CLAIMANTS ARE 
PARTICULARLY CONCENTRATED 
BUT TWO THIRDS OF INCAPACITY 
BENEFIT CLAIMANTS HAVE NO WORK 
SKILLS AT ALL THERE ARE CONCERNS 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S DRIVE TO CUT 
THE NUMBERS ON THE SICK WILL JUST 
INCREASE UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES THE 
GOVERNMENT FEEL IT'S MUST ACT THE 
COST TO THE TAX PAYER OF 
MAINTAINING SO MAN ON INCAPACITY 
BENEFIT IS SIXTEEN BILLION A YEAR 
YOU CAN SEE THAT FULL REPORT ON 
PANORAMA B. B. C. ONE TONIGHT

ACROSS ALL PAPERS TODAY IT IS THE 
GRIM NEWS FROM THE HOUSING MARKET 
ROYAL INSTITUTION OF CHARTERED 
SURVEYORS HAS WARNED THAT SALES OF 
HOUSES COULD DROP BY FORTY PER CENT THIS YEAR

TWO TOP BOSSES OF BAE'S SYSTEMS

AUTHORITIES AT AN AMERICAN AIRPORT 
LAST WEEK THEY ARE AN 
INVESTIGATING ALLEGATIONS OF 
CORRUPTION IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BUT B. A. E. 
DENIES ANY WRONGDOING

GET THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF 
GIVING UP MONEY LIKE WORKPLACE 
GIVING AND THEY ATTRACT TAX HELP 
FOR THE CHARITIES THE CAMPAIGN HAS 
BEEN LAUNCHED TODAY TO ENCOURAGE 
BUSINESSES TO ENCOURAGE US TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THOSE SCHEMES 
AND THE SHARES IN LONDON ON FRIDAY 
WERE UP FIFTY TWO POINTS THE DOW JONES 
WAS DOWN FIVE THE MAIN STORIES 
THIS MORNING M. P.'S VOTE TODAY ON 
WHETHER TO ALLOW SCIENTISTS TO 
CONTINUE CONTROVERSIAL RESEARCH 
MIXING HUMAN AND ANIMAL TISSUE 
A WEEK ON FROM THE DEVASTATING 
EARTHQUAKE CHINA BEGINS THREE DAYS 
OF MOURNING AS HOPES OF FINDING 
MORE SURVIVORS FATE 
ALSO COMING UP IT MIGHT LOOK 
BLOOMING MARVELLOUS BUT PREPARING 
FOR THE CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW IS HARD 
GRAFT AND A LABOUR OF LOVE 
I NEVER KNEW YOU NEEDED A HAIRDRYER 
LOUISE IS THERE LOOKING PICTURE 
PERFECT 
THIS IS A FIRST FOR MAY I HAVEN'T 
BEEN TO CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW MS. 
SITTING IN SEA OF TRANQUILLITY 
DESPITE PEOPLE SITTING AROUND 
TRYING TO FINISH OF THIS GARDEN AM 
PLEASED TO SAY THE WEATHER IS GOING 
TO BEHAVE ITSELF IMPECCABLY FOR THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS IT IS RATHER CHILLY 
START THAT IS OUR HEADLINE 
GENERALLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT 
THERE IS LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE 
WAY OF CLOUD ACROSS SCOTLAND 
BRINGING FEW SHOWERS AND THERE 
ARE ONE OR TWO IT ISOLATED SHOWERS 
COMING IN OFF THE NORTH SEA COAST 
AFFECTING EAST ENGLAND BUT 
GENERALLY NOT A BAD START SO 
JULIAN SCOTLAND BUT IF WE LOOK 
AROUND THE COUNTRY THERE IS 
LITTLE BIT MORE CLOUD AND ISOLATED 
SHOWERS ON THE NORTH SEA COAST BUT 
DECENT SUNSHINE FIRST THING FOR 
MANY AS THE DAY PROGRESSES MORE 
CLOUD COMING THROUGH A LIGHT 
NORTH EASTERLY BREEZE DRAGGING HIM 
MORE CLOUD AS THE DAY DEVELOPS IT 
IS GOING TO BE A RELATIVELY DRY DAY 
BUT THERE WILL BE SOME CLOUD FROM 
TIME TO TIME MAYBE AN ISOLATED 
SHOWER CROPPING UP IN SCOTLAND AND 
NORTHERN IRELAND LATER IN TERMS OF 
TEMPERATURES EYES OF SIXTEEN ARE SEVENTEEN 
DEGREES THROUGH THE NIGHT CLEAR 
SKIES THROUGH EASTERN ENGLAND 
HIGHS OF SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN DEGREES TOMORROW 
A SOUTH EASTERLY BREEZE SO PERHAPS 
SLIGHTLY BETTER WEATHER UP BUT 
AFTER A CHILLY START WITH TOUCH 
OF FROST ANYWHERE FROM THE MIDLANDS 
AND TO THE NORTH IT IS GOING TO BE 
A DRY BRIGHT AND SUNNY DAY WHAT 
THEY TOLD MORE DETAILS FROM MEAT 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
SHE HAS GLOVES ON 
IT IS NIPPY OUT THERE 
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS DOWN THERE IT 
IS LIKE THE CHELSEA TWINS JULIA 
GEORGE IS GOING TO BE DOWN THERE 
SHE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE 
CHAUFFEUR CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW IS 
PREPARING A WHAT THEY ARE DOING 
ALL THE LOVELY THINGS AND WHY YOU 
NEED A HAIR DRYER 
SHALL WE HEAR FROM HER 
HERE'S WHAT SHE PREPARED EARLIER 
FOR MANY PEOPLE THIS IS THE REAL 
CHELSEA AND IT IS LABOUR OF LOVE 
THIS IS THE WORST JOB OF ALL WE 
ARE BEING PUNISHED 
AS THE DEADLINE 
LOOMS EVERYBODY STARTS TO WONDER 
IF THEIR CREATIONS WILL BE READY 
THE CANCER RESEARCH GARDEN IS 
ALREADY TAKING PLACE IT IS A 
CONTEMPORARY WOODLAND DESIGN THE 
THEME IS PROGRESS AND THE WAR OF 
ALUMINIUM CIRCLES REPRESENTS 
THOUGHT BUBBLES YOU ARE NOTORIOUS 
FOR WORKING UP TO THE WIRE 
I AM 
ALWAYS LAST THIS HERE THE 
CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN WORKING AHEAD 
AND HAVE BOUGHT LIKE S. F. A. ASKED TO 
WORK UNDER LIGHTS 
DESPITE THE 
PRESSURE THERE IS AN UNDERSHOOT 
OVERWHELMING FEELING THAT EVERYBODY 
IS DOING SOMETHING THEY LOVE WHY 
ELSE WOULD THE BIG NAMES SHOW UP 
YEAR AFTER YEAR 
IT IN THE 
BLOOD IT IS THE EGO IT IS SHOWING 
OFF I DO IT BECAUSE NOBODY WOULD 
HAVE COMMISSIONED ME TO DO THIS ARE 
EXPLORED THE IDEA OF A CAFE GARDEN 
WITHOUT HAVING THE SPACE SO SO CHELSEA IS A CHANCE TO EXPERIMENT 
BUT THINGS DON'T ALWAYS GO TO PLAN 
ALL AT WORK AND IT HAS SPLIT 
EVERYONE IS STRIVING FOR PERFECTION 
AND SOME PLANTS DON'T MAKE THE 
GRADE 
THEY HAVE SELECTED THE ONES GRADE THEY WANT THEY CHOOSE THE NICEST 
ONES THIS ONE WASN'T IN FLOWER 
BUT REJECT 
YEARS OF PLANNING WEEKS OF HARD 
GRAFT AND AT THE END IT COULD ALL 
COME DOWN TO THE LIE ABILITY THE THE IDEA IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND 
HELP CONTAIN THEM 
WE HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING JULIA 
EARLIER BUT THEIR SHIAS 
LURKING IN THE UNDERGROWTH AT 
YES AND IN ANDY STURGEON'S GARDEN 
WHICH WE FEATURED IN THE REPORT 
TAKE LOOK AROUND IT IS 
ABSOLUTELY STUNNING THIS IS CANCER 
RESEARCH U. K.'S GARDEN IT LIVES UP 
TO SOME OF THE THEMES OF THE GARDA 
HAS THIS YEAR A VERY GREEN GREEN 
IN COLOUR AND IN ETHICS AS WELL 
THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF WATER 
FEATURES THIS YEAR ANDY HAS FOUR 
POMMES DESCENDING DOWN THE GARDEN 
AND THERE ARE LITTLE COMPUTER FED 
DRIPS WHICH GO INTO EACH OF THE 
POMS AND END UP AT THE BOTTOM OF 
THE GARDEN IN THIS POND THAT IS TO 
SYMBOLISE THE PROGRESS THAT CANCER 
RESEARCH U. K. IS MAKING THEY ARE 
VERY LUCKY BECAUSE THESE BLEAK 
SHOW GARDENS COST UP TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
AND IN THIS INSTANCE AN ANONYMOUS 
DONOR HAS PAID FOR THIS ONE THAT 
IS HOW PARTICULAR CONTRIBUTION TO 
THE CHARITY THE BIG THING THIS 
YEAR IT IS IT IS VERY GREEN LOTS 
OF WATER AND LOTS OF TOPIARY AND 
SOMETHING CALLED A GREEN WALL IT 
IS LIKE A GREEN ROOF THE IDEA IS 
THAT YOU GROW PLANTS UP THE ROOF 
UP THE WALL OF YOUR HOUSE THIS IS 
TO ENCOURAGE WILDLIFE INTO YOUR 
GARDEN SO LOTS OF ETHICAL MOODS AT 
CHELSEA THIS YEAR WE'LL TRY AND 
FEATURE AS MANY OF THE SHOW GARDENS 
AS WE CAN THROUGH THE BOOK MORNING 
ANDY STURGEON IT IS EIGHT THREE 
TIME MEDAL WINNER I'M GOING TO GET 
THE CAMERAMAN TO LOOK AT THE GARDEN 
NEXT DOOR EVERYONE IS SAYING THIS

GARDENS AS MUCH AS WE CAN WE'LL 
TALK TO YOU AGAIN IN BIT 
SEE YOU LATER WE ARE VERY

A HOLE IN ONE BACK LATER TAXI 
OF TROUSERS JUST IN CASE THEY GET A HOLE IN ONE BACK LATER TAXI 
IT WAS ONCE SO SIMPLE THE FAMILY 
WAS MUM AND DAD TOGETHER WITH THEIR 
CHILDREN THEN ADVANCED IN SCIENCE 
MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR WOMEN WHO 
COULDN'T GET PREGNANT TO HAVE KIDS 
MAKING MATTERS A BIT MORE 
COMPLICATED LOUISE JAMIESON WAS 
CONCEIVED THROUGH A SPERM DONOR 
SHE FOUND OUT AT THE AGE OF THIRTY TWO THAT 
THE MAN SHE THOUGHT WAS HER FATHER 
WASN'T HER REAL FATHER AS M. P.'S VOTE 
ON WHETHER TO BAN RESEARCH ON SO 
CALLED HYBRID EMBRYOS THEY'LL BE 
ASKED TO DECIDE WHETHER TO CHANGE 
THE LAW SO THAT I. V. F. CLINICS NO 
LONGER HAVE TO CT NEED FOR A FATHER 
LOUISE IS HERE NOW GOOD MORNING 
GOOD MORNING 
TELL IS ABOUT YOUR 
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE YOU WERE 
CONCEIVED THROUGH A SPERM DONOR 
THERE WAS THE SAME ISSUE THAT IN 
FACT YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOUR 
FATHER IN FACT WASN'T THE MAN YOU 
GREW UP WITH WASN'T YOUR REAL 
FATHER 
THAT'S RIGHT YOU'VE SAID FATHER IT REALLY YES I GREW UP AND IN 
CHILD HOOD IT FELT LIKE A SORT OF 
NORMAL FAMILY REALLY WHEN I WAS IN 
MY GOT TO ADOLESCENCE AGE OF TWELVE 
OR SO I STARTED TO HAVE KIND OF AN 
AWKWARDNESS THAT SOUNDS LIKE 
ANYBODY'S ASS LESSENT EXPERIENCE 
BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT IT WAS A 
SORT OF A LACK OF FITTING SOMEHOW 
BETWEEN ME AND DAD 
BY THE TIME YOU 
GOT IN TOUCH OR ESTABLISHED WHO 
YOUR 
WAS IT WAS TOO 
LATE REALLY WASN'T IT 
IT WAS TOO 
LATE TO MEET HIM IT WAS AWESOME TO 
GET THE IDENTITY TO KNOW HIS 
IDENTITY BUT IT WAS WAY TOO LATE 
HE HAD DIED MANY YEARS BEFORE WHAT WHAT WILL CHANGE WITH THESE NEW 
PROPOSALS 
THE PROPOSALS ARE TO PROPOSALS REMOVE THE CONSIDERATION WHICH IS 
CURRENTLY IN LAW TO TAKE INTO 
CONSIDERATION THE CHILD'S NEED FOR 
A FATHER OR FATHER FIGURE BEFORE 
TREATING A WOMAN FOR I. V. F. OR DONOR 
INSEMINATION WHATEVER 
DO YOU 
THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA 
NO I 
DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR 
SEVERAL REASONS BECAUSE FIRSTLY 
IT'S MAKING A DECISION BEFORE THAT 
COME INTO BEING IT'S 
MAKING A DECISION THAT IT DOESN'T 
NEED A FATHER OR EVEN A FATHER 
FIGURE I JUST DON'T THINK THAT 
WE'RE REMOTELY IN A POSITION AS A 
SOCIETY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT 
DECISION LOTS OF PEOPLE SAY THAT 
IT DOESN'T MATTER BUT THE RESEARCH 
IS INCONCLUSIVE AND THE DIRECTION 
IS ALL BASED ON IT'S VERY ADULT 
CENTRED AT THE MOMENT L. TOTALLY 
UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE HAVE A HEART 
THAT WANT CHILDREN THAT WANTS A 
CHILD TO LOVE AND THAT ALL FEELS 
VERY VERY LOVING BUT THE 
EXPERIENCE FROM ADOPTION THE 
EXPERIENCE FROM DONOR CONCEIVED 
PEOPLE IS THAT EVEN IF YOUR PARENTS 
ARE KIND OF LAVISHING LOVE UPON YOU 
IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S SORT OF 
RATHER COMPLEX IN THE WAY THE VERY 
WAY YOU CAME INTO BEING ALL THE 
LOVING INSTINCTS IN THE WORLD DON'T 
REPAIR THA 
THANK YOU FOR TALKING 
TO US THIS MORNING 
HERE'S AN ISSUE FOR YOU IF YOU'RE

GOOD MORNING I'M HERE AT CLAVERING 
PRIMARY SCHOOL HERE IT'S LIKE MANY 
SCHOOLS WE KNOW THE YELLOW SIGNS 
WARNING THIS IS A SCHOOL AREA 
THERE ARE THE SPEED BUMPS THESE 
ARE THE THINGS WHICH THE SCHOOL HAS 
PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE CHILDREN SAFER 
WHAT WE HEARD TODAY IS A CALL FOR 
PARENTS TO LET THEIR CHILDREN WALK 
TO SCHOOL MORE OFTEN RATHER THAN 
DRIVING THEM WHY STATISTICS SHOW 
IF YOUR ELEVEN YEAR OLD GOES TO 
SECONDARY SCHOOL YOU'RE TWICE AS 
LIKELY TO BE KILLED OUR INJURED 
THAN A TEN YEAR OLD GOING TO 
PRIMARY SCHOOL IN SECONDARY SCHOOL 
YOU GET TO WALK YOURSELF INSTEAD OF 
BEING DROPPED OFF LET'S TALK TO 
TWO GUESTS WHO KNOW ABOUT THIS 
ISSUE LESLIE HAS HER CHILDREN HERE 
RACHEL AND LUKE HOW WORRIED ARE 
YOU ABOUT THESE STATISTICS 
I DO 
REAL AISLES THERE IS MORE CHANCE OF 
PEOPLE BEING KNOCKED OVER IF THEY 
HAVEN'T WALKED LUKE MOVES TO 
SECONDARY IN SEPTEMBER I'M HOPING 
I CAN TEACH HIM THE SKILL THAT'S HE 
NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE 
OBSTACLES OF GOING THERE YOU'VE YOU'VE CYCLED TO SCHOOL TODAY DO YOU 
PREFER THAT OR BEING 
DROPPED OFF I I PREFER CYCLING WHEN YOU GET DROPPED OFF YOU DON'T GET AS MUCH EXERCISE 
THIS SCHOOL IS TAKING EXERCISE PART IN THE WEEK YOU HELPED DRAW 
UP THE PLAN TEM US ABOUT THAT THE THE TRAVEL PLAN IS A DOCUMENT WHICH 
GIVES US ACTIONS AND INITIATIVES TO 
WORK ON OVER A PERIOD OF TIME 
WE'VE HAD A PLAN FOR THREE YEARS 
NOW WE'VE INTRODUCED VARIOUS 
COUNTS TO CHECK ON THE LEVELS OF 
WALKING CYCLE TO SCHOOL WE HAVE A 
SCHEME FOR CHILDREN TO CYCLE WE 
HAVE PEDESTRIAN TRAINING WE DOT 
WALK ON WEDNESDAY SCHEME TONY TONY METCALFE YOU'RE THE HEAD TEACHER 
HERE HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT 
THESE STATISTICS AND DO YOU NOTICE 
THAT KIDS ARE DROPPING THEIR KIDS 
OFF AT PRIMARY SCHOOL AND LEAVING 
THEM AT SECONDARY SCHOOL 
YES IT'S 
EVERY PARENTS NIGHTMARE OF AN 
ACCIDENT ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL EVEN 
IN THIS RELATIVELY QUIET AREA THERE 
ARE DANGERS ABOUT IN UNDER THREE 
MONTHS PUPILS IN YEAR SIX WILL BE 
MAKING THE JOURNEY TO SECONDARY 
SCHOOL OVER A MILE THEY'LL HAVE 
TO CROSS A MAINE ROAD THEY'LL HAVE 
TO BE THERE FOR EIGHT THIRTY A M. ON DARK 
MORNINGS WE'RE CONSCIOUS OF OUR 
JOB IN TRAINING THE PUPILS SO THAT 
THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF THE DANGERS 
THAT WILL BE THERE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS CAMPAIGN IS 
TO ENCOURAGE MORE PARENTS TO LET 
THEIR KIDS WALK TO SCHOOL SO THEY 
ARE SAFER WHEN THEY GO TO SECONDARY 
SCHOOL SCHOOL THIS IS BREAKFAST THESE ARE THE 
MAIN STORIES M. P.'S VOTE TODAY ON 
WHETHER TO ALLOW SCIENTISTS TO 
CONTINUE CONTROVERSIAL RESEARCH 
MIXING HUMAN AND ANIMAL TISSUE 
A WEEK ON FROM THE EARTHQUAKE 
CHINA BEGINS THREE DAYS OF MOURNING 
AS HOPES OF FINDING MORE SURVIVORS 
FADE FADE ALSO COMING UP THIS MORNING I I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WISE 
TO PRETEND EITHER THAT TIME HAD 
STOOD STILL 
BACKING THE WHIP FOR GREY POWER 
SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLD HARASSON FORD IS BACK 
FOR MORE PLAYING INDIANA JONES 
SIXTY FIVE CAN HE STILL DO IT 
OF COURSE 
LOUISE IS AT THE CHELSEA FLOWER 
SHOW 
I CAN'T HEAR BUT HOPEFULLY YOU'LL 
HAVE SAID SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES 
OF WHAT AN AMAZING GARDEN I HAVE 
BEHIND ME I'M IN FRONT OF THE 
LAURENT PERRIER GARDEN AND IT IS 
TIPPED FOR AN AWARD BY THE END OF 
THIS WEEK ABSOLUTELY STUNNING NOT 
ONLY THEIR VIEWS WITH LOTS OF 
NEUTRAL TONES BUT THERE ALSO THE 
WEATHER THERE ISN'T A CLOUD IN THE 
SKY A CHILLY START L. HAVE GOT MY 
GLOVES ON BUT AT LEAST THERE IS 
SOME SUNSHINE TEMPERATURES DOWN TO 
MINUS FIVE DEGREES IN ABERDEENSHIRE 
SO IT WILL TAKE A TIME FOR THE 
TEMPERATURES IN SCOTLAND TO RECOVER 
A FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUD AS WELL 
WITH THE ODD LIGHT SHOWER DOTTED 
AROUND THERE ARE ONE OR TWO 
SHOWERS ON THOSE NORTH SEA FACING 
COAST'S FIRST THING BUT ALONG THE 
SOUTH COAST A BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL 
START AND DESPITE A CHILLY START 
AT LEAST WE HAVE SOME DECENT SUNNY 
SPELLS FURTHER WEST DRY BRIGHT 
AND SUNNY AND THE SAME FOR WALES 
AND NORTHERN IRELAND AS THE DAY 
PROGRESSES A FEW MORE CLOUD 
SUCCUMBING IN FORESTALL A SLIM 
CHANCE OF AN ISOLATED SHOWER FOR 
PLACES LIKE SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN 
IRELAND BUT THEY WILL BE FEW AND 
FIREBIRD TWEEN FAR BETWEEN A 
MAXIMUM OF TWELVE DEGREES IN SCOTLAND 
BUT IN THE SOUTH A HIGH OF SIXTEEN 
POSSIBLY SEVENTEEN WHICH IS SIXTY THREE DEGREES 
FAHRENHEIT TONIGHT ANOTHER CHILLY 
NIGHT PARTICULARLY AT THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE COUNTRY UNDER THOSE 
CLEAR SKIES TEMPERATURES PERHAPS 
LOW ENOUGH FOR A FROST MORE CLOUD 
THE FURTHER WEST YOU ARE BUT 
TOMORROW AGAIN ANOTHER DRY AND 
BRIGHT DAY AND EVENTUALLY WE'LL SEE 
THOSE TEMPERATURES RECOVERED AS THE 
WINDS CHANGED DIRECTION IT BECOMES 
SUDDENLY SO PERHAPS A LITTLE 
WARMER TOMORROW ALL IN ALL GREAT 
NEWS FOR CHELSEA IT ISN'T OPEN TO 
THE PUBLIC TODAY BUT I DON'T THINK 
HE WILL BE TOO DISAPPOINTED 
CHELSEA ON FRONT OF SOME OF THE 
PAPERS THIS IS AN WILLIAMS WHO IS 
WARMING HER IRISES THE MAIN STORY 
THOUGH IS THAT PARENTS ARE GOING 
TO BE ABLE TO INSTIGATE AN OFSTED 
INSPECTION OF THE SCHOOL IF THEY 
FEEL TEACHERS ARE FAILING TO 
STRETCH PUPILS 
THE SUN FEATURES A BRITISH COUPLE 
MAUREEN AND ANTHONY BAKER WHO WERE 
MISSING FOR THREE DAYS IN THE 
EARTHQUAKE ZONE THEY WERE IN NO 
SUCH MAN PROVINCE 
THE DAILY MAIL HAS PICTURE OF 
INDIANA JONES AND CALLISTER 
FLOCKHART HIS PARTNER AT THE 
PREMIER OF THE NEW MOVIE THE MAIN 
STORY IS THAT MIDDLE BRITAIN HAS 
BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE DEBT CRISIS 
EVEN PEOPLE WITH GOOD JOBS ARE 
BEING PLUNGED INTO THE RED 
THE INDEPENDENT HAS AN ENVIRONMENT 
STORY ACT NOW OR BRITAIN'S MOST 
PRECIOUS WILDLIFE WILL BE LOST 
FOREVER FOREVER THE GUARDIA REPORTS THAT THE 
CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN 
ATTACKED BY LEADING SCIENTISTS FOR 
DISTORTING EVIDENCE TO TRY TO 
RESTRICT ABORTION AND LIMIT KEY 
RESEARCH ON SO CALLED HYBRID 
EMBRYOS THIS IS ON THE EVE OF A 
SERIES OF COMMONS VOTES WHICH START 
TODAY AND PICTURE OF LITTLE 
GIRL WHO DIED 
AND THE DAILY EXPRESS SAY THAT 
BRITAIN SCIENTISTS LAST NIGHT 
CLAIMED TO BE ON THE BRINK OF 
FINDING A CURE FOR MRSA IT IS A 
REVOLUTIONARY JELL APPLIED TO THE 
NOSTRILS NOSTRILS AND THE TELEGRAPH LOOKS AT THE 
CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW AND RIGHT DOWN 
HERE THE VERDICT ON INDIANA JONES 
THE VERDICT IS IT IS CREAKY NOT AS 
BAD AS EVERYONE FEARED BUT NOT AS 
GOOD AS EVERYONE HOPED WILL STOP IT 
HAS GOT TAKE TWO HUNDRED MILLION TO GET 
BACK THE MONEY INVESTED 
SPEAKING OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS 
LET'S TALK TO DECLAN HOUSE SALES 
NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD 
YES FAIRLY GLOOMY NEWS FROM THE 
HOUSING MARKET THERE COULD BE 
SHARP FALL IN THE NUMBER OF HOUSES 
FOR SALE AT THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO 
THE ROYAL INSTITUTION OF CHARTERED 
SURVEYORS IT SAYS THE NUMBER OF 
HOUSES ON SALE COULD DROP BY FORTY PER CENT 
IF THAT HAPPENS IT DOES NOT JUST 
AFFECT HOMEOWNERS IT ALSO SPREADS 
MISERY FOR ESTATE AGENTS FURNITURE 
STORES AND SPREAD MORE WIDELY 
ACROSS THE ECONOMY EVEN REMOVAL 
MEN SAY THEIR BUSINESS HAS FALLEN 
BY ABOUT HALF 
IT ISN'T EVERY DAY YOU PAY SOMEBODY 
TO TAKE AWAY YOUR FURNITURE MOVING 
HOUSE IS EXCITING STRESSFUL AND 
AROUND THE COUNTRY HAPPENING LESS 
AND LESS OFTEN THIS IS BECOMING AN 
UNFAMILIAR SIGHT BANKS ARE 
BECOMING RELUCTANT TO LEND AND 
MAKING MORTGAGES MORE EXPENSIVE AND 
HARDER TO FIND BEFORE YOU MOVE 
INTO YOUR NEW HOUSE YOU HAVE TO 
BUY IT THE NUMBER OF MORTGAGES 
APPROVED HAS FALLEN BY JUST UNDER A 
HALF IN THE LAST YEAR AND THE 
NUMBER OF HOUSES CHANGING HANDS HAS 
GONE DOWN BY FORTY THREE PER CENT A NERVOUS 
HOUSING MARKET MEANS BUYERS AND 
SELLERS STAY ON THE SIDELINES 
EVERYTHING IS BECOMING MUCH MORE 
LAST MINUTE IN TERMS OF PEOPLE 
CONFIRMING THEIR REMOVALS AND 
GIVING US DATES THEY CAN MOVE FOR 
INSTANCE WE HAD A CUSTOMER WHO WAS 
PROVISIONALLY BOOKED IN FOR NEXT 
WEEK SHE PHONED US IN A FLOOD OF 
TEARS YESTERDAY HAVING LOST HER BY 
SHE NOW KNOWS SHE HAS TO GO THROUGH 
THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN THE THE UNCERTAINTY IS GOOD NEWS FOR SOME 
SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING WELL OUT OF 
THE GRIDLOCK IN THE HOUSING MARKET 
CONTAINERS LIKE THESE ARE FULL OF 
THE BELONGINGS BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
BEEN CAUGHT BETWEEN THE RUNS IN THE 
PROPERTY LADDER TOUGH TIMES MEANS 
LOOKING FOR NEW BUSINESS FIRMS ARE 
ALSO TURNING TO THE GROWING DEMAND 
FROM HOME REPOSSESSIONS 
PEOPLE WHO 
WERE 
EVICTED WHERE HOUSES 
ARE REPOSSESSED HAVE TO FIND A 
MOVER TO GET THEM OUT IT WILL BE A 
POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE BUSINESS BUT 
A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON EVERYBODY ELSE 
UNTIL BUYERS START STICKING MY NECK 
OUT AND THE BANK'S HELP THEM STICK 
THEM OUT FURTHER IT LOOKS LIKE 
SOME TIME BEFORE HOMEOWNERS WILL BE 
ON THE MOVE AGAIN 
YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING IN YORK E. 
MAILS AND TEXTS OF THAT FALLING 
HOUSE PRICES IS GOOD NEWS FOR 
FIRST TIME BUYERS BUT IT ISN'T AS 
HELPFUL AS YOU MIGHT THINK ROYAL 
INSTITUTION OF CHARTERED SURVEYORS 
ALSO SAYS THAT FIRST TIME BUYERS 
ARE NOT GETTING THE MORTGAGES THEY 
NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 
FALLING PRICES SO TOMORROW WE'LL 
LOOK AT RENTING AS MORE PEOPLE WHO 
WANT TO BUY THEIR FIRST HOME BACK 
CAN'T STAY IN RENTED ACCOMMODATION 
WHICH MEANS RENTS ARE LIKELY TO 
RISE NEXT YEAR 
ALL BIT GLOOMY ISN'T IT 
YES HE COULD HAVE FREE BUS TRAVEL 
BY NOW AND EXPLORE BRITAIN BUT 
ONE OAP HAS AS DIFFERENT ADVENTURE 
HARRISON FORD IS BACK AS INDIANA 
JONES TAKING ON THE BADDIES DURING 
THE COLD WAR THE FILM WAS 
PREMIERED LAST NIGHT AT THE CANNES 
FILM FESTIVAL 
THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL FINDS IT 
HARD TO RESIST HOLLYWOOD STARDUST 
AND THESE PEOPLE ARE HOLLYWOOD 
ROYALTY THIS ART HOUSE FILM 
FESTIVAL HAS LOST ITS HEART TO A 
FILM WHICH HAS BLOCKBUSTER WRITTEN 
ALL OVER IT INDIANA JONES IS BACK 
AND KNOWINGLY THE FILM 
ACKNOWLEDGES THE GAP THAT SINCE THE 
LAST MOVIE 
THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE 
EASY 
NOT AS EASY AS IT USED TO BE EASY INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF 
THE CRYSTAL SKULL FOLLOWS IN THE 
FOOTSTEPS NEARLY THREE DECADES AGO 
ARE REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL FRANCHISE 
IN WHICH HARRISON FORD WAS 
EFFORTLESS AS THE ACTION HERO BUT 
NOW HE IS NEARLY SIXTY SIX YEARS OLD AND 
MUCH ATTENTION HAS FOCUSED ON 
WHETHER HE IS CREDIBLE AS AN ACTION 
HERO FOR YOUNG AUDIENCE IS IT RELEVANT 
IT ISN'T RELEVANT TO ME RELEVANT I DO WHAT IS REQUIRED IN A 
CHARACTER I DON'T THINK IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN WISE TO DO TEND THAT TIME 
HAD STOOD STILL BACK TO PRETEND 
AND TIME HAS MOVED ON IN TERMS OF 
THE PLOT AS WELL THIS FILM IS SET 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN AT THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD 
WAR 
I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT WE WAR MAKE THE DECISION TO MOVE FORWARD 
IN TIME AND TOOK A VISIT THAT 
PERIOD IN HISTORY WHICH IS VERY 
INTERESTING IT WAS THE COLD WAR 
NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN AND THE ERA OF MCCARTHYISM IN 
THE UNITED STATES A PERIOD OF TIME 
IN OUR HISTORY WHICH I THINK IS 
SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF 
AND IT HAS SOME RESONANCE IN THE 
PRESENT 
ACTORS CATE BLANCHETT PRESENT ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY INDIANA THAT 
WASN'T ON THE CARDS BUT STEVEN 
SPIELBERG'S IMAGE DID APPEAL HE HE WANTED TO MAKE ME BUTCH L. HAD TO 
HANG OFF THE FRONT OF THEM TRUCK 
WITH A MACHINE GUN TRYING TO BLAST 
PEOPLE HE DID EIGHT HUNDRED NINETEEN TAKES ON A ONE 
I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE HE ENJOYED 
ME HOLDING A MACHINE GUN 
THIS IS 
SLICK FILM MAKING AND WHILE THE 
STORY IS ALWAYS A QUEST THE 
FRANCHISE CANDIDATES THE ARE SAT 
BOX OFFICE GOLD ALL HIGH MINDED 
SENSIBILITIES OF THIS FESTIVAL THE 
PRESENCE OF INDIANA JONES HERE HAS 
CAUSED GREAT EXCITEMENT NOT JUST 
AMONGST FANS BUT ALSO CRITICS 
WHENEVER IT CAN MEETS HOLLYWOOD 
THEY DO GET ON VERY WELL TOGETHER 
THE TELEGRAPH CALLED IT CREAKY BUT 
NOT ALL THE TIMES BENNETT FOUR 
STARS AND SAID THE SWASHBUCKLING 
WAS TRULY GREAT 
THE DAILY MAIL SAID THERE WERE NOT 
ENOUGH JOKES THE AUDIENCE IS 
DIVIDED DIVIDED STILL TO COME MORE HOLLYWOOD THAT THAT IS A REALLY REALLY STRONG MESSAGE 
OF WOMEN COMING TOGETHER AND HAVING 
FUN SOMETIMES DISCUSSING SEX 
SOMETIMES RELATIONSHIPS SOMETIMES 
JUST HOW CAN I JUGGLED THE JOB AND 
THE BABY 
OVER FORTY A FEMINIST AND 
FASHIONABLY FOXY KIM CATTRALL

ANIMAL ANIMAL SCIENTISTS SAY THE WORK HAS THE 
POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM LIVES HELP 
TO TREAT DISEASES LIKE ALZHEIMER'S 
AND PARKINSON'S CRITICS ARGUE IT

DISEASE IS A DEATH SENTENCE THESE THESE ARE HYBRID EMBRYOS CREATED IN 
NEWCASTLE THEY'RE NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE PER CENT HUMAN BUT

GOES AGAINST EVERY KIND OF MORAL 
TEACHING THAT WE'VE EVER KNOWN 
INITIALLY THE GOVERNMENT OPPOSED 
HYBRID EMBRYOS NOW MINISTERS 
SUPPORT THE RESEARCH SUBJECT TO 
STRICT CONTROLS LEADING MEDICAL 
BODIES INCLUDING SOME NOBEL PRIZE

THIS ENTIRE TOWN THIS ENTIRE AREA

BEICHUAN IS A MASS GRAVE 
THARVING YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AFTER SEVEN THIRTY A M. WE SPEAK IT CHINESE 
WOMAN LIVE ANYTHING LONDON SHE'S 
BEEN FUNDRAISING FOR PEOPLE 
AFFECTED BY THE EARTHQUAKE WE'LL 
FIND OUT HOW HARD IT IS TO GET IN 
TOUCH WITH LOVED ONES CAUGHT UP IN 
THE DISASTER 
HERE WARNINGS ABOUT HOW MUCH 
ALCOHOL IT'S SAFE TO DRINK STILL 
DON'T SEEM TO BE GETTING THROUGH 
SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THOSE QUESTIONED IN A SURVEY 
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 
COULDN'T SAY HOW MANY UNITS WERE IN 
A GLASS OF WINE TODAY THE 
GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES A NEW CAREFUL 
DRINKING CAMPAIGN 
WHEN YOU GO OUT FOR DRINK DO YOU 
KNOW HOW MUCH ALCOHOL YOU'RE 
HAVING WE'VE BEEN BOMBARDED WITH 
INFORMATION ABOUT ALCOHOL UNITS FOR 
YEARS BUT IT SEEMS LOT OF US ARE 
STILL NOT GETTING THE MESSAGE HOW 
MANY UNITS DO YOU THINK ARE IN THAT 
GLASS OF WINE THREE L. THINK THERE THREE ARE TWO ONE 
THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE ONES TO BE CONFUSED SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THOSE 
ASKED DIDN'T REALISE THIS LARGE 
GLASS OF WINE CONTAINS THROW UNITS 
TWO THIRDS DIDN'T REALISE DOUBLE 
GIN AND TONIC IS TWO UNITS AND ONE 
THIRD DIDN'T KNOW THAT AN AVERAGE 
PINT CONTAINS TWO UNITS AS WELL 
THIS ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN IS 
DESIGNED TO PUSH HOME THE SAFE 
DRINKING MESSAGE 
DID YOU KNOW IF 
WOMEN REGULARLY EXCEED TWO TO THREE 
UNITS A DAY IT COULD ADD UP TO A 
SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEM SOME SOME QUESTION WHAT DIFFERENCE ADS LIKE 
THIS REALLY MAKE 
THE YOUNG PEOPLE 
WE SPOKE TO IN OUR STUDY REPRESENT 
DRINKING AS BEING A VERY FUN 
ACTIVITY PARTICULARLY DRINK TO A 
POINT OF INTOXICATION COULD BE A 
LOT OF FUN THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE 
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WERE TAKING 
ACCOUNT OF THE UNITS THEY WERE 
DRINKING INDEED DRINKING TO A 
POINT MONITORING YOUR DRINK 
ANYTHING THAT WAY TOTALLY WENT 
AGAINST THEIR OBJECTIVE PRIMARILY 
TO GET DRUNK 
WHEN WE SHOWED THE 
NEW ADS TO THESE DRINKERS IT DID 
HAVE AN IMPACT 
OH MY GOD YOU 
MIGHT AS WELL NOT EVEN DRINK I I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THESE BEFORE L. 
THOUGHT A PINT OF BEER WAS TWO 
GLASS OF WINE WAS ONE MAYBE ONE 
AND A HALF SOME OF THEM ARE EVEN 
UP TO THREE 
I WOULD NEVER KNOW 
THIS SO EVEN IF IT DOESN'T DO 
NOTHING AT LEAST YOU KNOW THE THE QUESTION IS THOUGH HOW LONG WILL 
THEY REMEMBER THE SAFE DRINKING 
MESSAGE MESSAGE FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM SOUTH EAST 
ASIAN COUNTRIES ARE MEETING IN 
SINGAPORE TO DISCUSS WAYS TO HELP 
VIC TIFPLTZ CYCLONE WHICH HIT 
BURMA TWO WEEKS AGO THEY'RE HOPING

VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET A 
CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IF 
BURMA AND FOR AID WORKERS TOO

THE TREES HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM

FOREIGNERS WE WERE UNABLE TO GET 
OUT THROUGH CHECK POINTS AID 
WORKERS CAN'T GET OUT EITHER THE 
HARD HIT AREAS THE CYCLONE HIT 
AREAS IN THE DELTA ARE INACCESSIBLE 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHERE TO 
CHANNEL WHAT AID IS COMING THROUGH 
SOME ESTIMATES SAY AS MANY A TWENTY FIVE 
MILLION PEOPLE ARE IN NEED 
A LOT 
OF DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE BEING PUT ON 
NOT ONLY BIT MEETING TAKING PLACE 
WHERE YOU ARE TODAY BUT ALSO THE 
UN SECRETARY GENERAL IS GOING TO 
BURMA 
A LOT OF PRESSURE BEING PUT BURMA ON THE BURMESE MILITARY GENERALS 
THE RULERS OF THE COUNTRY TO ALLOW 
IN MORE AID THEY HAVE ALLOWED IN 
SOME AID WORKERS THEY SEEM TO BE 
SPENDING TIME IN THEIR HOTELS 
DISCUSSING HOW FRUSTRATING IT IS 
THE PEOPLE IN BURMA THOUGH ARE 
GETTING SOMETHING OF A PICTURE OF 
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE DELTA 
DESPITE THE CLAMP DUN ON NEWS AND 
DESPITE THE POSITIVE PICTURE SHOWN 
ON STATE TELEVISION IN MARKETS IN 
RANGOON THERE ARE D. V. D. S. FOR SALE 
PIRATEED D. V. D. S. SHOWING THE SUFFERING

LAST WEEK WE SPOKE TO NEIL DIAMOND 
ON THE PROGRAMME SINCE THEN THINGS 
ARE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER FOR 
HIM LET'S HEAR BIT OF HIM 
REACHING OUT TOUCHING ME 
TOUCHING YOU 
SWEET CAROLINE 
HE'S TOP OF THE POPS HERE AND IN 
AMERICA WITH HIS LATEST ALBUM HOME 
BEFORE DARK THE SUCCESS COMES MORE 
THAN FORTY YEARS AFTER THE RELEASE OF 
HIS DEBUT ALBUM 
HE'S NEVER HAD NUMBER ONE ON THE 
BILL BOARD TWO HUNDRED BR 
HE'S NEVER GONE 
STRAIGHT TO NUMBER ONE IN THIS 
COUNTRY 
HE'S SOLD MORE RECORDS COUNTRY THAN ANY OTHER LIVING CONTEMPORARY 
ADULT ARTIST IN THE WORLD APART 
FROM ELTON JOHN AND BARBARA 
STREISAND 
NO MORE FACTS TO COME STREISAND ON BREAKFAST LET'S TELL YOU WHAT 
ELSE IS COMING UP DO YOU DRIVE 
YOUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL WORRIED 
THEY MIGHT GET HURT APPARENTLY SO 
CALLED COTTON WOOL KIDS ARE AT 
GREATER RISK OF BEING INJURED IN A 
ROAD ACCIDENT WHICH THEY DO 
EVENTUALLY START TO WALK WE'D LOVE 
TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON ANY OF THE 
STORIES THIS MORNING 
MAYBE A GLASS OF WINE EVERY DAY NOW 
OR PINT OF BEER ON HOT DAY 
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT 
NO BUT MANY OF US DON'T KNOW HOW 
MANY UNITS THE IRAQ IN WIDE CHOICE CHOICE NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO 
DRIVE HOME THE MESSAGE 
THANKS WHAT YOU FANCY 
THIS HAS 
GOT TO BE THE LAST ONE ALL RIGHT 
WHAT A WEEK 
MIGHT AS WELL FINISH 
IT OFF 
DID YOU KNOW THAT IF MEN 
REGULARLY EXCEED THREE OR FOUR 
UNITS A DAY IT COULD LEAD TO A 
SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEM 
WHY ARE WE SO BAD IT KNOWING OUR 
MINUTES WITNESSES THE DIRECTOR OF 
EDUCATION AT THE BRITISH LIVER 
TRUST WE HAVE HAD THIS MESSAGE 
BEFORE BUT IT DOES NOT REALLY GET 
ACROSS WHY IS THAT 
IT IS QUITE 
CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE HOW MUCH 
ALCOHOL THERE IS IN AN ORDINARY 
DRINK WE KNOW THAT WIND AND PEERS 
ARE OFTEN STRONGER THAN THEY USED 
TO BE CLASS SIZES AS WELL WHAT 
USED TO BE A STANDARD GLASS IS NOW 
A MUCH LASSA AT LARGER GLASS 
THIS USED TO BE A STANDARD GLASS OF 
WINE BUT IF YOU GO OUT TO MANY 
PUBS OR BARS YOU OFTEN GET SERVED 
WITH THESE LARGER GLASSES WHICH 
ARE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLS 
THAT IS A THIRD OF A 
BOTTLE OF WINE 
YES AND THIS CLASS 
HERE WHICH MANY BEARS MAY HAVE AT 
CAN TAKE UP TO HALF A BOTTLE 
OF WINE 
THE REASON THE ALCOHOL 
TRADE SERVES IT IN LARGER GLASSES 
IS BECAUSE THEY MAKE MORE MONEY 
DON'T THEY 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT 
PEOPLE OFTEN DON'T KNOW HOW MANY 
UNITS THEY ARE CONSUMING IN THE 
SMALLER GLASS THAT WILL BE AROUND 
TWO UNITS JUST OVER TWO UNITS IN 
THE LARGER GLASS THREE POSSIBLY 
THREE POINT FIVE UNITS DEPENDING ON THE 
STRENGTH OF THE WIND 
THE WINE 
GLASS USED TO BE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLILITRES 
SURELY IT IS DOWN TO CONSUMER 
DEMAND ARE WE GOING INTO PUBS AND 
ASKING FOR BIGGER GLASSES 
THAT IS 
FINE BUT WE NEED TO RECOGNISE THAT 
IF PEOPLE ARE EXCEEDING THE 
GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES FOR HOW MUCH 
ALCOHOL THEY SHOULD HAVE A DAY 
WHICH FOR WOMEN IS TWO TO THREE 
UNITS A DAY 
WHICH IS WHAT YOU GET 
IN HERE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
BUT WHEN YOU 
GO TO A PUB OR RESTAURANT YOU ASK 
FOR A GLASS OF WINE 
SOMETIMES THEY SAY BE GOSS MOOR 
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BIG THEIR 
GLASSES YOU ARE GOING TO GET BIG 
OR SMALL THEY SHOULD MAKE IT 
CLEARER 
WE NEED PEOPLE 
TO BE ABLE CLEARER TO MAKE INFORMED CHOICES AND THAT 
MEANS KNOWING HOW MUCH ALCOHOL THEY 
ARE BUYING AND CONSUMING IF PEOPLE 
ARE EXCEEDING THE GOVERNMENT LIMITS 
THEY COULD BE PUTTING THEMSELVES AT 
INCREASED RISK OF HEALTH HARM 
WHICH CAN BE QUITE SERIOUS LIVER 
DISEASE HEART PROBLEM EVEN CANCER 
SO HOW MANY GLASSES LIKE THIS COULD 
YOU HAVE BEEN A DAY AND STILL 
REMAIN HEALTHY 
SAW A WOMAN TWO OR 
THREE UNITS WHICH IS ABOUT WHAT IS 
IN THAT CLASS 
WHEN DOES DAMAGE TO YOUR LIVER 
START 
WE RECOMMEND A PEOPLE STAY START WITHIN GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES AND 
GIVE THEMSELVES TWO CONSECUTIVE 
DAYS A WEEK WITHOUT ALCOHOL AND 
THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO 
YOU ARE NOT DAMAGING YOURSELF 
THANK YOU 
LET'S KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS LET'S 
LOOK AT SOME OF THE PAPERS WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT CHELSEA WE CALLED 
THEM THE CHELSEA TWINS ARE EARLIER 
LOUISE AND JULIA AND HERE'S

TELEGRAPH THIS INCORPORATES ONE OF 
THE LARGEST POMS ANYONE CAN 
REMEMBER AT THE CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW 
IT IS THE DESIGN FOR THE TELEGRAPH 
GARDEN AND THEIR MAIN STORY IS 
LOWER TAXES ON FAMILIES AND AN END 
TO RECKLESS STATE SPENDING WILL BE 
AT THE HEART OF TORY SPENDING PLANS 
AND YOU KNOW HOW THEY GET THOSE 
FLOWERS LOOKING FRESH YOU BLOW DRY 
THEM CAN YOU BELIEVE IT AS 
SUPPOSE IT WAS SO COLD LAST NIGHT 
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT THIS MORNING

INSTIGATE OFSTED INSPECTIONS OF THE 
CHILD'S SCHOOL IF THEY FEEL

STRETCH PUPILS TO THEIR FULL 
POTENTIAL POTENTIAL WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT HOW 
DIFFICULT IT HAS BEEN FOR PEOPLE

CHINESE EARTHQUAKE AND MAKE A RUN 
THAT MIRACULOUS ESCAPE TO PHONE

MAUREEN AND ANTHONY BAKER SURVIVED 
THE DEVASTATION AND THEY LIVED 
ROUGH AND TELL HELICOPTER FLEW 
THEM TO SAFETY YOU CAN IMAGINE 
THEIR SON HOW AWFUL HE MUST HAVE

GOOD MORNING YOU FIND 
ME IN ONE OF 
THE FEW 
TRULY COLOURFUL 
THIS YEAR 
CHELSEA IS VERY 
BOTH IN COLOUR 
AND ETHICS IN 
TO UNDERSTAND 
HIS GARDEN YOU 
HAVE 
TO IMAGINE A SCENARIO 
HAVE 
FROM THEIR TRAVELS 
WHERE THEY HAVE COLLECTED BEAUTIFUL 
PLANTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD THEY 
HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THEIR GARDEN 
WHICH WAS ONCE FULL OF WATER THE 
WATER TABLE HAS RECEDED AND THIS 
IS WHAT THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO DO SO 
IT IS GARDENING FOR THE FUTURE IT 
IS UNDERSTANDING THE CLIMATE AND 
THERE IS A WIND TURBINE AS A 
GESTURE TOWARDS WHAT WE NEED TO DO 
FOR ENERGY THIS IS A VERY 
SUCCESSFUL GARDEN DESIGNER BUT IT 
TAKES A LOT OF HARD WORK TO GET TO 
THIS STAGE SO SO YOU COULD 
UNDERSTAND WHAT GOES INTO IT WE 
CAME DOWN A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO 
WHEN CHELSEA WAS HALF BUILDING SITE 
HALF FLOWER SHOW 
FOR MANY PEOPLE THIS IS THE REAL 
CHELSEA IT IS A LABOUR OF LOVE 
THIS IS THE WORST JOB OF ALL YES YES WE ARE BEING PUNISHED 
AS THE 
DEADLINE LOOMS EVERYONE STARTS TO 
WONDER IF THEIR CREATIONS WILL BE 
READY ON TIME THE CANCER RESEARCH 
GARDEN IS ALREADY TAKING SHAPE IT 
IS A CONTEMPORARY WOODLAND DESIGN 
WITH A THEME OF PROGRESS A WAR OF 
ALUMINIUM CIRCLES IT REPRESENTS 
THOUGHT BUBBLES 
NOTORIOUS FOR WORKING UNDER THE 
WIRE 
I AM ALWAYS LAST THIS YEAR WIRE THE CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN THINKING 
AHEAD AND BOUGHT LIGHTS SO WE CAN 
WORK UNDER THEM DESPITE ALL THE 
PRESSURE THERE IS A MUCH 
UNDERWHELMING SENSE THAT EVERYBODY 
IS DOING SOMETHING THEY LOVE 
AN 
OVERWHELMING SENSE WHY THERE 
SHOW UP YEAR 
AFTER YEAR IT GETS IN THE BLOOD 
IT IS SHOW RING OFF 
I DO IT 
BECAUSE NOBODY WOULD HAVE 
COMMISSIONED ME TO DO THIS OR TO 
EXPLORE THE IDEA OF A CAFE GARDEN 
WITHOUT HAVING THE SPACE SO 
CHELSEA IS A JAR US TO EXPERIMENT 
BUT THINGS DON'T ALWAYS GO TO PLAN 
ALL I WERE AT AND IT HAS SPLIT 
EVERYONE IS DRIVING FORCE 
PERFECTION AND SOME PLANTS JUST 
DON'T MAKE THE GRADE 
THEY HAVE 
SELECTED THE ONCE THE A WANT 
IT IS 
A REJECT 
YEARS OF PLANNING WEEKS OF HARD 
GRAFT AND AT THE END IT CAN ALL 
COME DOWN TO THE LIFE OF UP AND 
LILY 
WE ARE AGAIN TO TRY AND HOW LILY CONTAIN THEM

THE CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW 
GOOD MORNING IT IS A CHILLY START 
IN CHELSEA HENCE THE NECESSITY FOR 
GLOVES IRONICALLY I AM IN AN 
ORGANIC GARDEN CAUGHT SOMMER COVER 
LETTER SOLSTICE IT DOES NOT FEEL 
VERY SUMMERY SUMMER SOLSTICE 
THE WEATHER LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING 
TO BE VERY NICE AT CHELSEA FOR THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS NOT GOOD FOR 
GARDENERS GENERALLY BECAUSE THERE 
ISN'T MUCH RAIN AROUND A CHILLY 
START BUT SUNNY TEMPERATURES AT 
THE FAR END OF SCOTLAND WERE AS LOW 
AS FIVE LAST NIGHT SAW A FROSTY 
START AND A FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUD 
ONE OR TWO OR ISOLATED SHOWERS 
GENERALLY SPEAKING IT IS A FINE 
CRISP START FOR MANY IN SCOTLAND 
WE HAVE CLOUD AND SHOWERS AS WE 
RUN DOWN THE NORTH SEA COAST A DRY 
START AND IN THE SOUTH EASTERN 
CORNER DRY AND BRIGHT WITH SUNNY 
SPELLS COMING THROUGH ALREADY AND 
IT CONTINUES TO STAY PROMISING 
ALONG THE SOUTH COAST DRY AND 
SUNNY IN WALES A CHILLY START A 
LITTLE MORE IN THE WAY OF CLOUD AND 
GENERALLY SPEAKING IT IS FINE AND 
LOOKS LIKE IT WILL STAY THAT WAY 
THE SAME IN NORTHERN IRELAND AS 
WELL AS THE DAY PROGRESSES SUBTLE 
CHANGES WE'LL SEE MORE CLOUD 
DEVELOPING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS 
THE TEMPERATURES START TO CLIMB 
AROUND TWELVE DEGREES AT THE HEIGHT IN 
SCOTLAND MAYBE SIXTY NINE OR SEVENTEEN ON THE 
SOUTH COAST MAY BE SIXTEEN UP OR SEVENTEEN 
THROUGH THE NIGHT CHILE AND FROST 
ANYWHERE FROM THE MIDLANDS FURTHER 
NORTH BUT GENERALLY WE ARE LOOKING 
AT AROUND BETWEEN THREE AND SIX 
DEGREES TOMORROW MORNING MORE OF 
THE SAME DRY AND BRIGHT WITH 
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE WE LOSE THE 
NORTH EASTERLY WIND AND STUCK TO 
DRAG IN A SOUTH EASTERLY WINDS SO 
IT MAY FEEL WARMER L. WILL BE BACK WITH YOU IN HALF AN HOUR 
SHE STILL HAS HER GLOVES ON 
I HOPE YOU ARE ENJOYING THE CHELSEA 
FLOWER SHOW AND ALL ITS BEAUTY 
BECAUSE IT IS DOOM AND GLOOM WHEN 
IT COMES TO DECLAN HE IS TALKING 
ABOUT HOW SALES FALLING 
I AM THE PURVEYOR OF BAD NEWS BUT 
NOT NECESSARILY ITS MANIFESTATION 
THE NEWS IS GRIM THEY COULD BE A 
SHARP FALL IN THE NUMBER OF HOUSES 
UP FOR SALE THIS YEAR THIS COMES 
FROM A REPUTABLE BODY THE ROYAL 
INSTITUTION OF CHARTERED SURVEYORS 
IT SAYS HOUSE SALES COULD DROP BY 
FORTY PER CENT IF THAT HAPPENS IT ISN'T 
JUST HOMEOWNERS WHO SUFFER 
EVERYTHING FROM ESTATE AGENTS TO 
FURNITURE SHOPS TO STALLS SELLING 
NEW WASHING MACHINES AND FRIDGES 
ALL THOSE ARE AFFECTED BY FALLING 
SALES OF THAT MAGNITUDE EVEN 
REMOVAL MEN SAY THEIR BUSINESS HAS 
DROPPED BY HALF OVER THE LAST YEAR 
IT ISN'T EVERY DAY YOU PAY SOMEBODY 
TO TAKE AWAY YOUR FURNITURE MOVING 
HOUSE IS EXCITING STRESSFUL AND 
AROUND THE COUNTRY HAPPENING LESS 
AND LESS OFTEN THIS IS BECOMING AN 
AM FAMILIAR SIGHT BANKS STUNG BY 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH ARE BECOMING 
RELUCTANT TO LEND MAKING MORTGAGES 
MORE EXPENSIVE AND HARDER TO FIND 
BEFORE YOU MOVE INTO A NEW HOUSE 
YOU HAVE TO BUY IT THE NUMBER OF 
MORTGAGES APPROVED HAS FALLEN BY 
JUST UNDER A HALF OVER THE LAST 
YEAR AND THE NUMBER OF HOUSES 
CHANGING HANDS HAS GONE DOWN BY FORTY THREE 
PER CENT A NERVOUS HOUSING MARKET MEANS 
BUYERS AND SELLERS ARE STAYING ON 
THE SIDELINES 
EVERYTHING IS 
BECOMING MUCH MORE LAST MINUTE IN 
TERMS OF PEOPLE CONFIRMING THEIR 
REMOVALS AND GIVING A STATES THEY 
CAN BE MOVED FOR INSTANCE WE HAD 
A CUSTOMER WHO WAS PROVISIONALLY 
BOOKED IN FOR NEXT WEEK SHE PHONED 
US IN TEARS YESTERDAY HAVING LOST 
HER BUYER SHE NOW KNOWS SHE HAS TO 
GO THROUGH THE WHOLE PROGRAMME AT 
PROCESS AGAIN 
THE UNCERTAINTY IS 
GOOD NEWS FOR SOME SOME PEOPLE ARE 
DOING WELL OUT OF THE GRIDLOCK IN 
THE HOUSING MARKET CONTAINERS LIKE 
THESE ARE FULL OF BELONGINGS OF 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED DOWN OR 
CAUGHT BETWEEN THE RUNS IN THE 
PROPERTY LADDER TOUGH TIMES MEAN 
LOOKING FOR NEW BUSINESS AS WELL 
AS STORAGE FIRMS ARE ALSO TELLING 
US THERE IS A GROWING DEMAND FOR 
REPOSSESSIONS UNTIL THE BUYER 
START STICKING THEIR NECKS OUT AND 
BANKS HELP THEM IT LOOKS LIKE IT 
WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE HOMEOWNERS 
ARE ON THE MOVE AGAIN 
MELANIE BIEN IS WITH ME FROM 
SAVILLS PRIVATE CLIENTS ONE OF OUR 
REGULAR COMMENTATORS ON THE HOUSING 
MARKET FIRST OF ALL THIS NEWS 
THAT THEY COULD BE A FALL IN THE 
NUMBER OF HOUSES UP FOR SALE WHY WHY THE DROP IT ISN'T SO MUCH AN 
AFFORDABILITY ISSUE AS A CREDIT 
ISSUE BUYERS ARE FINDING IT MORE 
DIFFICULT TO GET THE MORTGAGES THEY 
NEED TO BUY THE PROPERTIES THEY 
NEED SO THERE ARE FEWER 
TRANSACTIONS TAKING PLACE 
CONSEQUENTLY PRICES HAVE BEEN 
FALLING IN SOME AREAS A LOT AS 
SELLERS ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS THEY DON'T WANT TO SELL 
FOR LESS THAN THEY COULD HAVE GOT 
FEW MONTHS AGO SO THEY ARE HOLDING 
TIGHT 
SO IT IS AS SELLERS' STRIKE TIGHT IF FATE OF LEE YES IT IS HARDER 
FOR BUYERS TO GET THE PROPERTY THEY 
WANT TO BUY 
WHICH MEANS ALL THIS 
STUFF ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF 
THE HOUSING MARKET IS HELPING 
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET THEIR FIRST 
HOME BECAUSE PRICES ARE MORE 
AFFORDABLE BUT IF THEY CAN'T GET 
THE MORTGAGES THEY WANT THEY ARE 
NO BETTER OFF 
IT SHOULD BE THE 
PERFECT SITUATION FOR FIRST TIME 
BUYERS BUT IT IS MUCH HARDER FOR 
THEM TO GET FINANCE TO GET AN 
ABOVE NINETY PER CENT LOAN SO IT DOES NOT 
MATTER WHAT PROPERTY PRICES ARE IF 
THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY THEM 
THANK YOU 
WE ARE TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT THE 
HOUSING MARKET TOMORROW JUST 
BEFORE SEVEN A M. WE'LL LOOK AT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING WITH RENTING FIRST TIME 
BUYERS ARE FINDING THEY CAN'T GET 
MORTGAGES TO BUY THEIR PROPERTIES 
SO THEY ARE STAYING IN RENTED 
ACCOMMODATION SO RENTS ARE 
EXPECTED TO RISE SHARPLY THIS YEAR 
AS WELL THAT IS JUST BEFORE SEVEN A M. 
TOMORROW TOMORROW THANK YOU NOW HE COULD HAVE HAD 
FREE BUS TRAVEL TO EXPLORE BRITAIN 
BUT ONE OR OLD AGE PENSIONER THAT 
IS A TROUBLE TURNED SENIOR 
CITIZEN HAS GONE ON A SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT ADVENTURE 
THE OLDER PERSON WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT IS HARRISON FORD HE IS BACK 
AS ALL ACTION HERO INDIANA JONES 
TAKING ON THE BADDIES DURING THE 
COLD WAR THE FILM PREMIERED LAST 
NIGHT AT THE OBBYOSS AND ITS STAFF 
TALK TO US AT THE CANNES FILM 
FESTIVAL FESTIVAL HOLLYWOOD FINDS IT HARD TO RESIST 
CANNES FINDS IT HARD TO RESIST 
HOLLYWOOD SHOWBIZ THIS THIS 
FESTIVAL HAS LOST ITS HEART TO A 
FILM WHICH HAS BLOCKBUSTER WRITTEN 
ALL OVER IT INDIANA JONES IS BACK 
AND IT ACKNOWLEDGES THE NINETEEN YEAR GAP 
SINCE THE LAST MOVIE 
THIS ISN'T 
GOING TO BE EASY 
NOT AS EASY AS IT 
USED TO BE 
INDIANA JONES AND THE 
KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL 
FOLLOWS IN THE FIRST STEPS NEARLY 
THREE DECADES AGO ARE REMARKABLY 
SUCCESS ABROAD SUCCESSFUL 
FRANCHISE IN WHICH HARRISON FORD 
WAS EFFORTLESS AS THE ACTION HERO 
BUT NOW HE IS NEARLY SIXTY SIX YEARS OLD 
AND MUCH ATTENTION HAS FOCUSED ON 
WHETHER HE IS CREDIBLE AS AN ACTION 
HERO FOR A YOUNG AUDIENCE DO YOU 
THINK IT MATTERS IS IT RELEVANT 
IT ISN'T RELEVANT TO ME L. DO WHAT 
IS REQUIRED IN THE CHARACTER 
DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WISE 
TO PRETEND THAT TIME HAD STOOD 
STILL 
AND TIME HAS MOVED ON IN STILL TERMS OF THE PLOT THIS FILM IS SET 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN AT THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD 
WAR 
I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT WE WAR MADE THE DECISION TO MOVE FORWARD 
IN TIME AND TO VISIT AGAIN A LATER 
PERIOD IN HISTORY WHICH IS ALSO 
VERY INTERESTING WHICH IS THE 
PERIOD OF THE COLD WAR NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN IT IS 
THE ERA OF MCCARTHYISM IN THE 
UNITED STATES A PERIOD OF TIME IN 
OUR HISTORY WHICH I THINK IS 
SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF 
AND HAS SOME RESONANCE IN THE 
PRESENT 
ACTRESS THE CATE BLANCHETT PRESENT ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY INDIANA THAT 
WASN'T ON THE CARDS BUT STEVEN 
SPIELBERG'S IMAGE OF HER AS THE 
VILLAIN DID APPEAL HE WANTED TO 
BRIDGE ME UP WE DID ONCE SEE 
MIRA WAS HANGING OFF THE FRONT OF A 
TRUCK WITH A MACHINE GUN BLASTING 
OUT HE DID ABOUT EIGHTY NINE TAKES ON THAT 
AND I THINK IT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE 
HE ENJOYED ME HOLDING A MACHINE GUN 
EIGHT OR NINE TAKES THIS IS 
SLICK FORMULA FILM MAKING WHILE 
THE STORY IS WAS A QUEST THE 
FRANCHISE CAN PREDICT THE ANSWER 
BOX OFFICE GOLD FOR ALL OUR HIGH 
MINDED SENSIBILITIES OF THIS 
FESTIVAL THE PRESENCE OF BEAT 
INDIANA JONES FILM HERE HAS CAUSED 
GREAT EXCITEMENT NOT JUST AMONGST 
FANS BUT ALSO CRITICS WHENEVER 
CANNES MEETS HOLLYWOOD THEY GET ON 
VERY WELL 
THEY DON'T CALL HIM AND AT OAP IN 
AMERICA AMERICA THEY CALL HIM MR. FORD HE ISN'T

ANIMAL THE SCIENTISTS SAY THE WORK 
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM 
MILLIONS OF LIVES HELPING TO TREAT 
DISEASES LIKE ALZHEIMER'S OR 
PARKINSON'S CRITICS THOUGH SAYS IT 
HAMPERS WITH NATURE AND IS IMMORAL 
MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE IS ONE OF 
DOZENS OF CONDITIONS WHICH 
SCIENTISTS HOPE IT TARGET WITH 
HYBRID EMBRYO RESEARCH SEVEN 
MEMBERS OF LIZ SHIPLEY'S FAMILY 
HAVE DIED FROM THE DISEASE SHE 
HOPES THE WORK COULD HELP FUTURE 
GENERATIONS 
IF YOU WATCHED WHAT GENERATIONS MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE DOES TO HELP 
THEN YOU WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO BAN 
THIS KIND OF TREATMENT NOBODY 
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SUFFER 
PUTTING IT BLUNTLY MOTOR NEURONE 
DISEASE IS A DEATH SENTENCE 
THESE ARE HYBRID EMBRYOS CREATED 
IN NEWCASTLE THEY'RE NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE PER CENT HUMAN 
BUT CONTAIN A TINY AMOUNT OF ANIMAL 
D. N. A. SCIENTISTS WANT TO EXTRACT 
STEM CELLS FROM THEM TO BETTER 
UNDERSTAND DISEASES LIKE 
PARKINSON'S AND ALZHEIMER'S 
BUT THIS CONSERVATIVE M. P. WILL BE 
ARGUING THAT HYBRID EMBRYO RESEARCH 
SHOULD BE BANNED OUTRIGHT 
THEY ARE CREATING WHAT IS ETHICALLY 
QUITE WRONG SOMETHING WHICH IS 
ANIMAL AND HUMAN AND THAT GOES 
AGAINST EVERY KIND OF MORAL 
TEACHING THAT WE'VE EVER 
KNOWN INITIALLY 
THE GOVERNMENT KNOWNINITIALLY OPPOSED HYBRID EMBRYOS BUT NOW 
MINISTERS SUPPORT THE RESEARCH 
SUBJECT TO STRICT CONTROLS 
LEADING MEDICAL BODIES INCLUDING 
SOME NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS SUPPORT 
THE CREATION OF HYBRID EMBRYOS 
TODAY IT WILL BE M. P.'S WHO DECIDE 
WHETHER THAT WORK SHOULD CONTINUE 
OR IF IT SHOULD BE BANNED 
IN A FEW MINUTES WE'LL HAVE A 
DEBATE ABOUT THIS FRANKENSTEIN 
SCIENCE OR A WAY TO SAVE AND 
IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE PEOPLE GET IN TOUCH IF YOU HAVE SOME 
OPINIONS ON THAT THIS MORNING 
WE'RE GOING TO TURN OUR ATTENTION 
TO CHINA MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED RELIEF 
WORKERS HAVE BEEN BURIED OVER THE 
PAST THREE DAYS BY MUD SLIDES IN 
SOUTH WESTERN CHINA WHILE WORKING 
TO TRY TO REPAIR QUAKE DAMAGED 
ROADS THE NEWS COMES AS THE 
COUNTRY BEGINS A NATIONAL DAY OF 
MOURNING STUNNED AND UNITED IN 
GRIEF THE NATION CAME TOGETHER 
EARLIER TO OBSERVE THREE MINUTES OF 
SILENCE THAT WAS JUST OVER HALF 
AN HOUR AGO IT WAS AT THE EXACT 
MOMENT THE QUAKE STRUCK LAST MONDAY 
WARNINGS ABOUT HOW MUCH ALCOHOL 
IT'S SAFE TO DRINK STILL DON'T SEEM 
TO BE GETTING THROUGH TO A LOT OF 
US THREE QUARTERS QUESTIONED IN A 
SURVEY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 
COULDN'T SAY HOW MANY UNITS THERE 
WERE IN A GLASS OF WINE TODAY THE 
GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES A NEW CAREFUL 
DRINKING CAMPAIGN 
WHEN YOU GO OUT FOR A DRINK DO YOU 
KNOW HOW MUCH ALCOHOL YOU'RE 
HAVING WE'VE BEEN BOMBARDED WITH 
INFORMATION ABOUT ALCOHOL UNITS FOR 
YEARS BUT IT SEEMS AN AWFUL LOT OF 
US ARE STILL NOT GETTING THE 
MESSAGE HOW MANY UNITS DO YOU 
THINK THERE ARE IN THAT GLASS OF 
WINE THREE WINE THREE AND YOU 
I THINK THERE ARE TWO ONE ONE THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES TO BE 
CONFUSED THREE QUARTERS OF THOSE 
ASKED DIDN'T REALISE THAT LARGE 
GLASS OF WINE CONTAINS THREE UNITS 
TWO THIRDS DIDN'T REALISE DOUBLE 
GIN AND TONIC IS TWO UNITS AND ONE 
THIRD DIDN'T KNOW THAT AN AVERAGE 
PINT CONTAINS TWO UNITS AS WELL 
THIS ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN IS 
DESIGNED TO PUSH HOME THE SAFE 
DRINKING MESSAGE 
DID YOU KNOW IF 
WOMEN REGULARLY EXCEED TWO TO THREE 
UNITS A DAY IT COULD ADD UP TO A 
SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEM 
BUT SOME 
QUESTION WHAT DIFFERENCE ADS LIKE 
THIS REALLY MAKE 
THE YOUNG PEOPLE 
WE WILL SPOKE TO IN OUR STUD JI 
REPRESENT DRINKING AS BEING A FUN 
ACTIVITY IT CANLY DRINKING TO THE 
POINT OF INTOXICATION COULD BE A 
LOT OF FUN THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE 
THAT YOUNG P. PEOPLE WERE TAKING 
ACCOUNT OF THE UNITS THEY WERE 
DRINKING OR MONITORING YOUR 
DRENGING IN THAT WAY WENT AGAINST 
THEIR OBJECTIVE WHICH WAS TO GO 
OUT AND GET DRUNK 
WHEN WE SHOWED 
THE NEW ADS TO THESE DRINKERS IT 
DID HAVE AN IMPACT 
OH MY GOD YOU 
MIGHT AS WELL NOT EVEN DRINK I I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THESE BEFORE L. 
THOUGHT A PINT OF BEER WAS TWO A 
GLASS OF WINE OR ONE AND A HALF IT 
TURNS OUT SOME ARE EVEN UP TO THREE 
I WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN THIS EVEN 
IF IT IT DOESN'T DO NOTHING AT 
LEAST YOU KNOW 
QUESTION IS HOW 
LONG WILL THEY REMEMBER THE SAFE 
DRINKING MESSAGE 
FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM SOUTH EAST 
ASIA ARE MEETING IN SINGAPORE TODAY

AMAZING AMAZING WE USED TO JINX POP STARS DIDN'T 
WE BUT NOW I THINK IT MAY HAVE 
CHANGED CHANGED I THINK SO DUFFY WILL BE VERY 
PLEASED SHE'S COMING ON LITTLE LATER LATER ALSO STILL TO COME 
SHE CAN'T BE NANCY NIAMH WILL BE 
HERE AS SHE LEAVES I WILL DO 
ANYTHING ANYTHING DO YOU LET YOUR CHILDREN WALK TO 
SCHOOL OR DRIVE THEM BECAUSE 
YOU'RE WORRIED THEY MIGHT GET HURT 
APPARENTLY SO CALLED COTTON WOOL 
KIDS EVENTUALLY FACE GREATER RISK 
OF BEING INJURED ON OUR STREETS 
RAYMOND BUCHANAN IS AT A SCHOOL IN 
HARTLEPOOL TO TELL US WHY 
FOR QUITE SOMETIME THIS SCHOOL HAVE 
BEEN ENCOURAGING MORE PARENTS TO 
USE THEIR LEGS RATHER THAN CARS 
PARENTS TEND TO DRIVE THEIR 
CHILDREN TO PRIMARY SCHOOL BUT WALK 
TO SECONDARY SCHOOL CONSEQUENTLY 
DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF CHILDREN AGED 
ELEVEN TO TWELVE ARE KILLED THAN PRIMARY 
SCHOOL LESLEY YOU'VE WRITTEN A 
TRAVEL PLAN FOR ALL PARENTS AND 
WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE 
WE WANTED TO 
ENCOURAGE THE CHILDREN TO GET OUT 
USE THEIR LEGS FOR THE HEALTH AND 
FRIENDLY THE TRAVEL PLAN IS A WAY 
OF US BRINGING IN CERTAIN 
INITIATIVES TO DO THAT 
LET'S TALK 
TO KIDS WHO WALK TO SCHOOL HERE 
LUKE AND AMY LUKE YOU WILL CYCLED 
TODAY DO YOU ENJOY DOING THAT MORE 
THAN GETTING A LIFT 
I DO WHEN YOU 
CYCLE YOU GET EXERCISE WHEN YOU 
GET DROPPED OFF YOU'RE NOT GETTING 
AS MUCH EXERCISE 
AMY MANY CHILDREN MIGHT THINK IT'S 
EASIER FOR THEM IF THEY GET LIFT 
WHAT DO YOU PREFER 
I PREFER 
WALKING BECAUSE I GET TO HAVE SOME 
QUALITY TIME WITH MY MUM AND I GET 
TO SEE ALL MY FRIENDS WHEN I WALK 
TO SCHOOL WHEREAS IF YOU'RE IN THE 
CAR YOU JUST GET TO GO STRAIGHT TO 
SCHOOL SCHOOL WE'RE JOINED BY LORNA WHO IS A 
PARENT AND ALSO CHILDMINDER HOW 
IMPORTANT IS IT FOR CHILDREN'S 
HEALTH THAT THEY WALK 
I THINK IT'S 
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT YES FOR THEIR 
HEALTH BUT ALSO CHILD DEVELOPMENT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE OVERLOOK THE FACT 
THAT IF THEY DON'T LEARN TO USE 
THEIR LEGS AND BALANCING WALKING 
ON THE PAVEMENT RUNNING OVER THE 
GRASS THEY'RE NOT LEARNING THE 
LITTLE THINGS THEY NEED TO THEN GO 
INTO SCHOOL AND BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN 
IN A CLASS AND WRITE AND DO THOSE 
KINDS OF THINGS AM 
THANK YOU 
I WILL LET THE CHILDREN GET INTO 
SCHOOL BREAKFAST CLUB IS BEGINNING 
IN A FEW MOMENTS THIS IS BUSY 
WEE SCHOOL BUT WHAT THEY'RE TRYING 
TO DO IS ENCOURAGE MILLIONS OF 
CHILDREN TO USE THEIR LEGS INSTEAD 
OF THEIR CARS 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME HE HAS 
STILL GOT IT HARRISON FORD WHO 
SWINGS INTO ACTION AS INDIANA JONES 
SHE IS BEGGING US FROM MERCY AND WE 
ARE GLADLY GIVING END THE 
DELECTABLE DUFFY WILL BE HERE ON 
THE SOFA 
THEY ARE WORKING HARD DOWN AT 
CHELSEA IT MIGHT LOOK BLOOMING 
MARVELLOUS BUT PREPARING FOR THE 
CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW IS HARD GRAFT 
AND A LABOUR OF LOVE 
DID YOU SPOT DUFFY'S TALENT IN 
WALES EXACTLY BREAKFAST BLESSED 
AGAIN 
YOU JUST WOULD NOT BELIEVE THE 
TEMPERATURE HERE IF I WAS IN THE 
SUNSHINE OR JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE PATH IT IS LITTLE WARMER 
UNIJET LOVES IF YOU'RE STANDING 
OUTSIDE FOR THREE OR FOUR HOURS 
YOU NEED YOUR GLOSS LOSS YOU 
WOULD NOT BELIEVE THE HARD WORK 
THAT IS GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES 
HERE THE JUDGES ACT AS WE SPEAK 
THE WEATHER IS BEHAVING ITSELF 
IMPECCABLY THERE IS LITTLE CLOUD 
AROUND PRIMARILY IN SCOTLAND ONE 
OR TWO ISOLATED SHOWERS ONE OR TWO 
RUNNING IN THE NORTH SEA COAST 
PUSHING IN THROUGH NORTH YORKSHIRE 
AND LINCOLNSHIRE THERE IS NOT 
CLOUD IN THE SKY IN LONDON SOME 
BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINE THAT WILL HELP 
TO LIFT THE TEMPERATURES THE 
FURTHER SOUTH AND WEST YOU COME WE 
ARE LOOKING AT TEMPERATURES OF 
SEVEN OR EIGHT DEGREES IN THE 
MORNING OVER TO NORTHERN IRELAND 
PLENTY OF CLEAR SKIES THERE IS AT 
CHANCE OF SEEING ONE OR TWO 
ISOLATED SHOWERS THEY SHOULD BE 
FEWER FAR BETWEEN GENERALLY 
SPEAKING A PLEASANT DAY IN STORE 
THIS AFTERNOON MORE CLOUD 
DEVELOPING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT 
WILL STAY PREDOMINANTLY DRY TWELVE 
DEGREES IN SCOTLAND AND MAYBE SIXTEEN OR 
SEVENTEEN ALONG THE SOUTH COAST THROUGH 
THE NIGHT TONIGHT WE WILL CONTINUE 
TO HAVE QUITE ACTUALLY ALL NIGHT TO 
COME PARTICULARLY IN THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE COUNTRY TEMPERATURES 
IN THE CITIES AROUND THREE DEGREES 
IN RURAL PARTS THEY WILL BE CLOSE 
TO FREEZING ANOTHER COOL START 
THE DRY AND SONNY ONE TOMORROW WE 
SEE WINDS SWINGING AROUND TO 
SOUTH EASTERLY DIRECTION WARMER 
TOMORROW SEVENTEEN IS GENERALLY THE HIGH 
ALL IN ALL PLAIN SAILING IF 
YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO THE CHELSEA 
FLOWER SHOW FROM WEDNESDAY WE 
COULD SEE THIS WEATHER STAYING WITH 
US THE WEATHER BEHAVING ITSELF 
IMPECCABLY 
GO AND GET YOURSELF SOME SUNSHINE 
WILL BE BACK AT CHELSEA LATER 
JULES IS DOWN THERE WITHOUT ANY 
SHOES ON 
IS IT FRANKENSTEIN SCIENCE OR WAY 
TO SAVE AND IMPROVE THE LIVES OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SHOULD 
SCIENTISTS BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE 
RESEARCH ON HYBRID EMBRYOS PART 
ANIMAL PART HUMAN TWO VERY 
DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT 
WITH US NOW DOCTOR KIERAN BREEN IS 
FROM 
KEIRIN LET ME START WITH YOU THIS 
IS A VERY IMPORTANT DAY FOR PEOPLE 
LIKE YOU CELLS EXPLAIN WHY M. P.'S 
SHOULD VOTE THIS THROUGH 
THE USE OF THESE EMBRYOS ARE VERY 
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW STEM 
CELLS WORK AND HOW STEM CELLS CAN 
BE TRANSFORMED FROM THIS WE CAN 
UNDERSTAND HOW TO TREAT CONDITIONS 
SUCH AS PARKINSON'S THERE WILL RUN 
AT AND TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE U. K. WITH 
PARKINSON'S THIS IS ONE POTENTIAL 
WAY OF FINDING CURE 
THERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT FROM 
HYBRID EMBRYO THAT HAS A TINY BIT 
OF ANIMAL MATERIAL THERE IS NO 
QUESTION OF ANYTHING BEING BORN 
FROM THAT KEY MATCH ABSOLUTELY NOT 
THE BILL WOULD MAKE THE TRANSFER OF 
THIS EMBRYO INTO THE WOMB ILLEGAL 
THE DEAL WILL HAVE VERY STRICT 
REGULATIONS WHICH WILL BE 
MONITORED BY THE HUMAN 
FERTILISATION EMBRYOLOGY AUTHORITY 
IT WILL ONLY BE SCIENTISTS TO CAN 
PROVE THE NEED TO USE THIS KIND OF 
TECHNOLOGY WILL BE GIVEN THE 
LICENCE LICENCE A LOT OF M. P.'S SAY IT CAN SAVE AND 
IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OVER 
TIME A LOT OF OUR VIEWERS WHO 
HAVE PARENTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S AND 
PARKINSON'S SAY IF YOU CAN DO 
ANYTHING TO HELP THESE PEOPLE IT 
IS WORTH AT 
WE ARE VERY CROSS THAT PEOPLE WITH 
THESE CONDITIONS ARE BEING 
EXPLOITED BY THESE ARGUMENTS AS 
THEY WERE WHEN THE ORIGINAL EMBRYO 
LEGISLATION WAS BEING PUT THROUGH 
NEARLY TWENTY YEARS DOWN THE LINE WE 
ARE BEING TOLD THE SAME THING AGAIN 
THERE ARE NOT CURES OR TREATMENTS 
JUST AROUND THE CORNER DOCTOR GREEN IS 
BEING MUCH MORE CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT 
THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS AT SOME POINT 
IN THE FUTURE BUT GORDON BROWN IS 
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CURES 
JUST AROUND THE CORNER THAT IS NOT 
TRUE THAT IS EXPLOITATIVE THESE 
ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS THESE ELLIE 
EMBRYOS AS FAR AS WE KNOW THEY 
HAVE A TINY ADD MIXTURE OF ANIMAL 
D. N. A. BUT FOR ALL INTENTS AND 
PURPOSES IT SEEMS THESE ARE HUMAN 
EMBRYOS THE BILL GOES A LOT 
FURTHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
CREATING EMBRYOS WHICH ARE HAVE 
ANIMAL HALF HUMAN 
THERE IS BIG SENSITIVITIES YEAR 
IN THAT THERE IS LIFE IN THESE 
EMBRYOS POTENTIALLY HUMAN LIFE 
WHICH IS DISTORTED 
THESE EMBRYOS WILL NOT BE USED TO 
MAKE ANIMALS THEY WILL NOT BE 
PLACED IN THE WOMB THEY ARE TOOLS 
TO UNDERSTAND STEM CELL THEY WOULD 
NOT BE SUITABLE FOR TRANSPLANTATION 
TO TREAT OR ULTIMATELY TO CURE 
CONDITIONS WE DO NOT KNOW IT MAY 
BE YEARS DOWN THE LINE BEFORE WE 
WILL UNDERSTAND FULLY HOW THIS WORK 
AND WHETHER IT WOULD BE SUITABLE 
PAUL YOU STILL RETAIN YOUR 
OBJECTION OBJECTION THOSE EMBRYOS SOMETHING IS BOUND 
TO HAPPEN HAPPEN TO THEM THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE ABUSED DESTROYED THEY 
BE ALLOWED TO GROW AND 
HAVE A LIFE 
THEY ARE DESTROYED 
THE M. B. O. WILL BE AFFECTED 
YES THE REASON BEHIND THESE 
STUDIES IS THAT YOU GROW UP OF 
THE EMBRYO WILL ONLY BE ALLOWED TO 
GROW TO FOURTEEN DAYS THEN THEY CAN BE 
GROWN INTO NERVE CELLS 
THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU COMMONS 
COMMENTS I THINK THE PUBLIC AT 
LARGE WILL BACK THE EFFECTS BECAUSE 
THEIR FAMILIES ARE SUFFERING FROM 
TERRIBLE ILLNESSES LINDA SAYS THEY 
SHOULD BE BANNED TOTALLY BECAUSE 
THEY ARE ALTERING EVOLUTION 
IF YOU HAVE GOT GREEN FINGERS URINE 
FOR A TREAT AT THE CHELSEA FLOWER 
SHOW TODAY YOU ARE COMING UP 
SMELLING OF ROSES AS EVER 
BREAKFASTS JULIA GEORGE 
BREAKFAST'S BREAKFAST'S GOOD MORNING AM HIDING THOSE 
STOCKING FEET BRITISH GARDENERS 
HAVE HAD LOT TO COPE WITH IN THE 
LAST TWELVE MONTHS THIS ELEGANT 
COURTYARD GARDEN IS DESIGNED 
PRECISELY TO COPE WITH THE PROSPECT 
OF A CHANGING CLIMATE HOW DID THEY 
CREATE THESE MASTERPIECES OF SHOW 
GARDENS WE CAME DOWN LAST WEEK TO 
HAVE LOOK AT THE WORK IN PROGRESS 
FOR MANY PEOPLE THIS IS THE REAL 
CHELSEA IT IS LABOUR OF LOVE 
THIS IS THE WORST JOB OF ALL 
AS THE DEADLINE LOOMS EVERYONE 
STARTS TO WONDER IF THEIR CREATIONS 
WILL BE READY ON TIME THE CANCER 
RESEARCH GARDEN IS ALREADY TAKING 
SHAPE IT IS THE CONTEMPORARY 
WOODLAND DESIGN THE THEME IS 
PROGRESS AND THE WALL OF ALUMINIUM 
CIRCLES REPRESENTS THOUGHT BOTTLES 
YOU ARE NOTORIOUS FOR REALLY 
WORKING UNDER THE WIRE 
I AM ALWAYS LAST THIS YEAR THE 
CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN THINKING 
AHEAD THEY HAVE ACTUALLY GONE AND 
BOUGHT LIGHTS 
DESPITE ALL PRESSURE THERE IS AN 
OVERWHELMING SENSE THAT EVERYONE 
HERE IS DOING SOMETHING THEY LOVE 
WHY ELSE WOULD THE BIGGER NAMES 
SHORE UP YEAR AFTER YEAR 
IT GETS IN THE BLOOD IT IS EGO IT 
IS SHOWING OFF L. DO IT BECAUSE 
NOBODY WOULD HAVE COMMISSIONED ME 
TO DO THIS OR TO EXPLORE THE IDEA 
OF A CAFE GARDEN WITHOUT HAVING THE 
SPACE SPACE SO CHELSEA IS A CHANCE TO 
EXPERIMENT BUT THINGS DO NOT 
ALWAYS GO TO PLAN 
ALTHOUGH WORK AND IT HAS SPLIT 
EVERYONE IS STRIVING FOR PERFECTION 
SOME PLANTS DO NOT MAKE THE GRADE 
WE HAVE SELECTED THE ONES WE WANT 
THEY CHOSE THE GNEISSES PLANTS AND 
IF THEY DO NOT FLOWER LIKE THAT ONE 
IT IS A REJECT 
YEARS OF PLANNING WEEKS OF HARD 
GRAFT AT THE END IT COULD ALL COME 
DOWN TO THE LIFE OF THE LILY 
THE IDEA IS TO HELP CONTAIN THEM 
A THINGS YOU DO FOR CHELSEA

DERMOT GAVIN WITH US THE REPORT 
ENDED WITH PEOPLE FINGERS CROSSED 
HOPING IT WOULD TURN OUT WELL YOUR

NOBODY ELSE HAS GONE TO DO IT 
UNLESS THEY SEE IT IT IS CHANCE 
FOR YOU TO BECOME A CLIENT FOR YOUR 
OWN IDEAS 
I WAS TALKING TO YOUR PLANTS EXPERT 
TOWARDS THE END OF LAST WEEK AND 
SHE SAID ONE OF THE LOVELY THINGS 
IS IT IS WORK IN PROGRESS WHY 
DID YOU GO FOR THE MULTI STAN 
AWARD AT TEA USE AN INDIAN BEAN 
TREE ON THE A SINGLE STEM A 
WANTED TO USE AN INDIAN BEAN TREE 
ON A SINGLE STEM 
SPRING HAS COME 
LATE HOW MUCH OF A CHALLENGE HAS 
THAT BEEN FOR GARDENERS HERE AND 
DOLLAR THE COUNTRY 
WE HAVE TO GET USED TO ONE SETTLED 
WEATHER IT HAS BECOME STORY NOW 
AND TURNS OF CHELSEA I GARDEN IN 
REAL TIME DO NOT THINK THERE 
SHOULD BE PRETENSION WE SHOULD

OTHER HALF 
THOSE THREE JUDGES ARE HERE PRUE 
LEITH OLIVER PEYTON AND MATTHEW 
FORT GOOD MORNING TO YOU ALL LET 
ME START WITH YOU PRUE WHAT'S 
STRIKING YOU ABOUT THIS YEAR'S LOT 
THEY'RE YOUNGER THEY'RE KEENER 
THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN KEEN BUT THESE 
ARE MORE ADVENTUROUS I THINK 
PARTLY BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUNG IT'S 
BEEN HUGE FUN THEY'RE GREAT LOT 
I REALLY LIKE THE CHEFS IT'S THE 
JUDGE THAT'S ARE THE PROBLEM HAVE HAVE THEY BEEN SQUABBLING 
NEVER STOP 
THERE'S REASON PRUE IS ON THAT SIDE 
I DO FIND YOU TEND TO AGREE SIDE ON DISHES WHEN DISHES COME THROUGH 
AND YOU THINK I'M NOT SURE IF 
THEY'RE GOING TO GO FOR THAT JASON 
ATHERTON CAME IN WITH A STARTER OF 
SANDWICHES ONE OF WHICH WAS IN A 
GLASS BIZARRELY L. THOUGHT THEY'D 
NEVER GO FOR THAT 
WE LOVED IT ALL ALL THREE OF YOU LOVED IT WHO WANTS TO 
EAT SANDWICH IN GLASS 
WHY NOT 
SANDWICHES AS YOU MAY REMEMBER THE 
HISTORY WERE MADE FOR PEOPLE WHEN 
THEY WERE GAMBLING SO THEY COULD 
PICK UP SOMETHING IN THEIR HANDS 
AND EAT IT 
WHY DOES IT NEED TO 
STAND STILL WHY CAN'T FOOD MOVE 
FORWARD AND EVOLVE 
I DON'T WANT IT 
TO MOVE FORWARD IF IT'S MOVING 
FORWARD THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG 
WITH IT 
GOOD THING YOU'RE NOT A 
JUDGE 
THIS COMPETITION THE MOST JUDGE INTERESTING THING FOR ME WAS THE 
FACT THAT HISTORICALLY HAUTE 
CUISINE RESTAURANTS HAVE FOUND IT 
DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES 
BECAUSE IT'S A WEEKEND MARKET BUT 
THIS TIME THE AMOUNT OF CHEFS 
PRODUCING EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH 
QUALITY FOOD OUTSIDE LONDON HAS 
REALLY I'VE BEEN TAKING BY THAT 
FACT AT A WORLD CLASS LEVEL NOT 
JUST A BRITISH LEVEL 
TIME FOR YOU 
TO TRAVEL AND GET ROUND THE COUNTRY 
A BIT MORE IT WON'T COME AS SUCH A 
SURPRISE 
YOU LOVED IT THE SURPRISE CONTROVERSY AS WELL THIS YEAR OF 
COURSE WAS ABOUT BRITISH 
INGREDIENTS AND ALLOWING ONE OF THE 
PROGRAMMELES I SAW A BIG DEBATE 
ABOUT COCONUT AND ALL SORTS OF 
THINGS THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE 
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF 
THE FINAL WHAT DO THEY NEED TO 
HAVE THE CHEFS 
THE CORE 
INGREDIENT HAS TO BE BRITISH AND 
TO THEIR REGION AS WELL BEYOND 
THAT I THINK THAT BRITISH COOKING 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN ENORMOUSLY 
INCLUSIVE IN BORROWING INGREDIENTS 
FROM ELSEWHERE 
THINK OF A CUP OF 
TEA 
WE WERE LOOKING FOR A SENSE OF TEA PERSONALITY THAT COMES THROUGH EACH 
DISH AND EACH STYLE OF FOOD YOU'RE YOU'RE REALLY AHEAD OF GORDON RAMSAY ON 
THIS HE STARTED OFF A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS AGO YOU SAY IT HAS TO BE 
LOCAL AND SEASONAL 
IT HAS TO BE 
LOCAL SEASONAL BUT I THINK THAT'S 
JUST A GENERAL TREND ALL OVER THE 
WORLD IT'S PARTLY TO DO WITH THE 
ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE THINKING LET'S 
HAVE LESS AIR MILES ALSO TO DO 
WITH SUPPORTING FARMERS AND PEOPLE 
ARE MORE INTERESTED IN WHERE FOOD 
COMES FROM THE FACT THAT PEOPLE 
ARE LESS IINGNORPBTS ABOUT FOOD IS 
THE 
BEST THING THAT'S HAPPENED THE THE BEST THING FOR THE GHERKIN IS THE 
CHEFS COMING TO TASTE THE FOOD ARE 
REALLY WE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING 
TO BE EXPECTING THEY'RE GOING TO 
WANT TO SEE ORIGINALITY BECAUSE 
IT'S SUCH A GLOBAL WORLD NOW 
EVERYBODY CAN SEE WHAT OTHER CHEFS 
ARE COOKING ROUND THE WORLD L. 
THINK WITH THIS BATCH OF CHEFS THAT 
HAS BEEN IN THIS COMPETITION THERE 
IS ORIGINAL COOKING CAN YOU 
HONESTLY SAY THE DISHES HAVE 
DEFINED THE CHEF 
IN TERMS OF THE 
PUBLIC THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO THE 
GHERKIN HOST HESTON BLUMENTHAL AND 
TOP CHEFS FROM AROUND THE WORLD CELEBRITIES LIKE BILL AND I WILL BE 
THERE ON TABLE PRESUMABLY 
THOUGH WE HAVEN'T HAD OUR INVITE 
YET 
WE'VE BEEN BUMPED OFF FOR YOU YET WE SAID WE'D TAKE A SMALL TABLE BY 
THE KITCHEN HOW ACCOUNT PUBLIC GET 
INVOLVED BETWEEN NOW AND THEN VOTE VOTE THE FIRST COURSE I MEAN EACH DAY 
THIS WEEK IS DEVOTED TO DIFFERENT 
COURSES STARTING TODAY WITH THE 
FIRST COURSE 
IT STARTS EARLIER SIX P. M. 
IT LASTS FOR AN HOUR PEOPLE HAVE 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR THEIR 
FAVOURITE DISH WE RANK THEM IN 
ORDER WE THINK BUT THEY CAN 
CHOOSE ANYTHING THAT THEY FEEL 
THEY CAN CHOOSE ANYTHING AS LONG AS 
THEY AGREE WITH US NONSENSE THE NONSENSE THE FINAL IS THIS BIG FEAST AT THE 
GHERKIN WHEN IS IT WHEN JUNE WHEN JUNE JUNE FIRST HESTON BLUMENTHAL WILL BE 
OUR GREAT HOST AND JUDGE REALLY 
BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE 
SHOWS HAVE BEEN LONGER IT'S 
INTERESTING THAT THEY'RE LONGER 
BECAUSE I MEAN THE COOKING IS BY 
FAR THE MOST INTERESTING THAT WE'VE 
SEEN PEOPLE WILL LEARN A LOT FROM 
IT I'VE LEARNED LOT 
THEY CAN 
VOTE EARLY AND OFTEN 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH 
WE ARE NOT GOING BILL 
GIVE ME THE 
CHEQUE NOW 
HE COULD HAVE HAD FREE BUS TRAVEL 
TO EXPLORE BRITAIN BUT ONE SENIOR 
CITIZEN HAS GONE ON THAT IF AND 
ADVENTURE ADVENTURE HARRISON FORD IS BACK AS AN ALL 
ACTION HERO INDIANA JONES TAKING 
ON THE BADDIES THE FILM PREMIERED 
LAST NIGHT AT CANNES 
CANNES FINDS IT HARD TO RESIST 
HOLLYWOOD STARDUST AND THESE PEOPLE 
ARE RED CARPET ROYALTY THE 
FESTIVAL HAS LOST ITS HEART TO A 
FILM WHICH HAS BLOCKBUSTER WRITTEN 
ALL OVER IT INDIANA JONES IS BACK 
KNOWINGLY THE FILM ACKNOWLEDGES 
THE NINETEEN YEAR GAP SINCE THE LAST 
MOVIE 
THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY MOVIE NOT AS EASY AS IT USED TO BE 
INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF 
THE CRYSTAL SKULL FOLLOWS IN THE 
FOOTSTEPS NEARLY THREE DECADES AGO 
OF A REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL 
FRANCHISE IN WHICH HARRISON FORD 
WAS AN EFFORTLESS AS THE ACTION 
HERO BUT NOW HE IS NEARLY SIXTY SIX AND 
MUCH ATTENTION HAS FOCUSED ON 
WHETHER HE IS CREDIBLE AS AN ACTION 
HERO FOR YOUNG AUDIENCE 
DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS IS IS IRRELEVANT IT ISN'T RELEVANT TO ME 
I DO WHAT IS REQUIRED IN A 
CHARACTER I DON'T THINK IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN WISE TO PRETEND EITHER 
THAT TIME HAD STOOD STILL 
AND TIME 
HAS MOVED ON IN TERMS OF THE PLOT 
AS WELL THE FILM IS SET IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
AT THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR ONE I WAS VERY PLEASED WE MADE THE 
DECISION TO MOVE FORWARD IN TIME 
AND TO REVISIT THE LATER PERIOD IN 
HISTORY WHICH IS ALSO VERY 
INTERESTING WHICH IS THE PERIOD OF 
THE COLD WAR NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN IT IS THE ERA 
OF MCCARTHYISM IN THE UNITED STATES 
APPEARED OF TIME IN OUR HISTORY 
WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING WE 
NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF AND HAS SOME 
RESONANCE IN THE PRESENT CATE CATE BLANCHETT ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY 
INDIANA BUT THAT WASN'T ON THE 
CARDS BUT STEVEN SPIELBERG'S IMAGE 
OF HER AS VILLAIN 
HE WANTED TO 
MAKE ME BUTCH IN ONE SEQUENCE AND 
HANGING OFF THE FRONT OF A TRUCK 
WITH A MACHINE GUN BLASTING OUT 
TRYING TO KILL PEOPLE HE NOT ONLY 
HE NORMALLY DOES ONE OR TWO TAKES 
AND HE DID ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE ON A 
ONE I THINK BECAUSE HE ENJOYS 
SEEING ME WITH THEIR MACHINE GUN 
WHILE THE STORY IS ALWAYS A QUEST 
THE FRANCHISE CAN PREDICT THE 
ANSWER BOX OFFICE GOLD ALL HIGH 
MINDED SENSIBILITIES OF THIS 
FESTIVAL THE PRESENCE OF THE FOURTH 
INDIANA JONES FILM HERE HAS CAUSED 
GREAT EXCITEMENT NOT JUST AMONG 
ITS FANS BUT ALSO CRITICS 
WHENEVER CANNES MEETS HOLLYWOOD 
THEY DO GET ON WELL TOGETHER 
YOU CAN SEE MORE OF THAT INTERVIEW 
WITH HARRISON FORD ON THE B. B. C. 
WEBSITE WELL WE HAVE REACHED THE 
SEMI FINALS OF I'D DO ANYTHING 
ONE MORE NANCY HAS BEEN STRIPPED OF 
HER LOCKET NIAMH WAS SENT HOME 
LAST NIGHT WELCOME TO THE 
PROGRAMME LET'S HEAR WHEN SHE 
LEARNED HER FATE 
IT IS TIME TO FIND OUT WHO IS 
ULTIMATELY GOOD ENOUGH ANDREW 
ANDREW YOU MUST DECIDE RACHEL OR 
NIAMH WHO WILL USE SAVE 
IT IS A 
VERY DIFFICULT SONG TO SING THAT 
JUMPERS A NASTY ONE INDEED IF I 
WAS CASTING EVITA I WOULD 
SERIOUSLY BE THINKING OF YOU FOR 
THAT ROLE RACHEL YOU HANDLED IT 
VERY WELL YOU WARM IT INTO THE 
SONG BUT IT IS THE MOST DIFFICULT 
DECISION ULTIMATELY TONIGHT I 
HAVE TO SAY RACHEL CONGRATULATIONS CONGRATULATIONS RACHEL RACHEL AND YOU END UP CONSOLING RACHEL 
THIS IS WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
HIS LORDSHIP SAYS IF I WAS CASTING 
EVITA YOU WOULD GET THE JOB AND 
THEN HE GIVES YOU THE ELBOW IT IT JUST WASN'T MEANT TO BE L. BELIEVE 
IN FATE SO IF IT WASN'T FOR ME IT 
WASN'T FOR ME 
THEY SAID VERY 
POSITIVE THINGS FOR YOU FROM THE 
GET GO YOU ARE DESTINED TO BE A 
POP SINGER AND A COUPLE OF YEARS 
YOU WOULD BE A LEADING LADY ON THE 
WEST END STAGE BUT THROUGHOUT 
THERE WAS SAY YOU WERE TOO SMALL 
TOO YOUNG AND TOO CUTE THEY WERE 
WONDERING WHETHER YOU HAD THAT 
NANCY IN YOU 
THAT WAS ALWAYS THE 
QUESTION IN A WAY I AM QUITE 
PLEASED THAT THE QUERY WAS ABOUT 
SOMETHING I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER L. 
CAN'T MAKE MYSELF ARE OLDER AND I 
DON'T WANT TO CHANGE MYSELF 
AT THE 
SAME TIME WHILE BEEN COMPLEMENTED 
DENISE DID SAY YOU SOUNDED MORE 
LIKE A TEENAGER HAVING A TANTRUM 
AND A LEADING LADY WHICH WASN'T 
VERY KIND 
NO BUT IT IS THEIR 
JOB AND IT IS CONSTRUCTIVE 
CRITICISM SO WHY DOES NOT TO UPSET 
BY THAT 
WHAT I FIND DIFFICULT IS 
THAT WHEN YOU HAVE TO SAY WHICH 
OTHER GULLS WOULDN'T BE NANCY L. 
CAN'T REMEMBER WHO YOU SAID 
I KIND 
OF SAID IT HONESTLY DOES NOT MEAN A 
HUGE DEMAND WE ALL HATE DOING IT 
IN ALL HONESTY NONE OF US REALLY 
MEAN WHAT WE SAY IT HAS BEEN 
DIFFERENT PEOPLE ALL ALONG 
I FIND 
THAT WEIRD WHEN THE NANCYS ARE 
HAVING TO TURN AGAINST ONE ANOTHER 
WHO DO YOU THINK WILL GET THROUGH 
I THINK ALL GIRLS COULD DO IT BUT 
I ONE SAMANTHA TO WIN FOSSIL 
DEFINITELY 
WE WISH YOU ALL THE DEFINITELY BEST IF IT CAME TO KIND HAS YOU 
WOULD BE NANCY 
TAKE YOU VERY MUCH 
AND YOU'LL BE IN SOMETHING ANDREW 
LLOYD WEBBER ALMOST PROMISED YOU

SHOWER THE SHOWERS THOUGH TODAY 
WILL BE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN ONE OR 
TWO ISOLATED SHOWERS IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND SCOTLAND LATER AS WE

AFTERNOON MORE CLOUD DEVELOPING 
BUT LARGELY DRY A FINE PLEASANT 
START TO THE WORKING WEEK HAS 
DOCKED TWELVE TO FOURTEEN DEGREES IN THE NORTH 
AND MAYBE THIRTEEN TO FOURTEEN IN THE FAR EASTERN 
CORNER A CHILLY NIGHT TO COME IN 
THE EAST TEMPERATURES FALLING TO 
ABOUT THREE DEGREES IN THE CITIES 
TOMORROW WE START OFF ON A SIMILAR 
VEIN BUT CHILLY START WITH A TOUCH 
OF FROST ANYWHERE FROM THE MIDLANDS 
ZERO BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING DRY AND

GORGEOUS 
THANK YOU FABULOUS TO BE GORGEOUS BACK IN LONDON 
OF COURSE YOU WERE 
BORN IN LIVERPOOL 
AND IN THE LAST 
FEW YEARS I HAVE BEEN PRETTY MUCH 
LIVING 
IN LONDON L. DID TWO SHOWS IN THE WEST END AND I DID A FILM 
WITH DANIEL RADCLIFFE FAR I. T. V. THIS THIS FILM I CAN'T REMEMBER A FILM WHICH 
HAS BEEN SO TALKS ABOUT AND HAD SO 
MUCH HYPE AS SEX AND THE CITY THE 
MOVIE 
IT HAS BEEN QUITE AMAZING MOVIE IN THE FOUR YEARS THAT WE HAVE NO 
LONGER BEEN ON TELEVISION OUR 
AUDIENCE BASE HAS ACTUALLY GROWN 
IT HAS GONE GLOBAL WE WERE A HALF 
HOUR SHOW ON A CABLE NETWORK THE 
MOST VIEWERS WE EVER HAD WAS ABOUT 
SEVEN MILLION BUT IN THE FOUR YEARS 
IT HAS GONE GLOBAL 
WERE YOU 
RELUCTANT TO GO BACK TO SAMANTHA A 
LOT HAPPENED TO YOU FOUR YEARS AGO 
FOR US TO BE WET THROUGH A DIVORCE 
THEN YOUR DAD WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A 
DIMENSION WAS THERE ARE BITS OF 
YOU THAT THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO 
GO BACK THERE 
THERE ARE TIMES IN 
YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU NEEDED TIME OUT 
I NEEDED TIME OUT L. ALSO FEEL THAT 
AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF INTENSE WORK 
NOT JUST IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA BUT 
ALSO PROMOTING THE SHOW WE ALL 
NEEDED TIME AT WE DIDN'T HAVE A 
SCRIPT OR A BUDGET NOBODY HAD A 
CONTRACT IT CAME AROUND AT EXACTLY 
THE PERFECT MOMENT OUR AUDIENCE 
BASIS SO BIG NOW AND IN THOSE FOUR 
YEARS WE HAD MORE STORIES TO TELL 
THE GIRLS ARE NOW IN THEIR FORTIES 
AND ONE A LITTLE BIT OLD EGG BUT BUT YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW WHAT DO YOU 
THINK THE FILM GIVES US APART FROM 
BEING A BOOSTER EDITION WHERE DOES 
IT TAKE US 
YOU SEE THE GIRLS FOUR 
YEARS LATER IN FOUR YEARS IN A 
WOMAN'S LIFE A LOT CAN HAPPEN BUT 
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE SHOW 
THAT OTHER SHOWS THE WOMEN HAVEN'T 
PROVIDED I THINK THAT HIS FRIENDS 
AS FAMILY MEN AS WE KNOW COME 
AND GO WOMEN ARE ALWAYS THERE FOR 
US AT LEAST MY GIRLFRIENDS HAVE 
BEEN THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS 
REALLY REALLY STRONG A STRONG 
MESSAGE OF WOMEN COMING TOGETHER 
AND HAVING FUN SOMETIMES 
DISCUSSING SEX SUNTANS 
RELATIONSHIPS SUNTANS JUST HOW CAN 
I JUGGLE THE JOB AND THE BABY ALL 
OF THOSE IN A VERY FUNNY AND 
ANYWAY 
BILL YOU ARE LOOKING AT ANYWAY ME HE IS ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS 
BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT 
EXACTLY FOSTERED THAT IS FOR THE 
GIRLFRIEND AND IF YOU DID HEAR IT 
YOU WOULD TURN BLUE 
CAN WE CHANGE 
THE SUBJECT 
GOOD MORNING 
OF THE 
FOUR IT IS FAIR TO SAY I THINK 
THAT YOU ARE THE MEN'S FAVOURITE 
FOR REASONS I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY 
YOU GET THAT FEEDBACK 
I DO THE 
THING ABOUT SAMANTHA IS SHE IS VERY 
MUCH LIKE A MAN OR HOW ONE MAN 
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT WHICH IS SEX 
WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED WHILE WHILE STILL TALKING ABOUT SEX IT IS A 
BREAKFAST PROGRAMME 
IN HIS ABOUT SEX 
IT IS YOUR YOUR CHARACTER ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND 
STILL IS IN THE FILM THE MOST 
CANDID ABOUT IT 
YES SHE IS 
FEARLESS NOT JUST IN THE BEDROOM 
AND SHE IS INCREDIBLY HONEST 
PEOPLE ASK ME IF I AM LIKE SAMANTHA 
I WISH I WAS BUT I AM NOT THAT 
BRAVE 
WHAT WAS IT LIKE AT THE BRAVE PREMIERE OR THE NEWSPAPERS ARE 
LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF TENSION 
BETWEEN UN THE OTHER GIRLS AM SURE 
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME 
TIME IS THERE HAS THERE BEEN A 
FALLING OUT 
MY GOD NO WE WORK FALLING OUT TOGETHER ON THESE AMAZING NINETY 
NOWADAYS PEOPLE EXPECT US BECAUSE 
WE PLAY BEST FRIENDS TO HANG OUT 
AFTERWARDS BUT AFTER NINETEEN HOUR DAY 
EVEN MY GORGEOUS TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD 
BOYFRIEND DOES NOT LOOK APPEALING 
I JUST WANT TO SLEEP AND 
AND DOES BECAUSE SHE WORKED TOGETHER IT 
DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN BE WORKING 
FRIENDS AND FRIEND FRIENDS EXACT EXACT LIVE WE HAVE SPENT TEN YEARS 
TOGETHER AND I DON'T THINK WE 
WOULD HAVE THE CHEMISTRY THAT WE DO 
HAVE AND IT WOULD HAVE LASTED THIS 
LONG IF THAT WERE GOING ON BUT 
THERE IS TREMENDOUS RESPECT BETWEEN 
THE FOUR OF US 
IS THERE GOING TO 
BE A SEQUEL EVERYBODY WANTS TO 
KNOW EVERYBODY WAS COMING OUT OF 
THE SCREENING AND ASKING THEM THE 
NEXT ONE WAS HAPPENING

IN FOUR YEARS WE WERE NOT DOING 
THIS SERIES BUT NOBODY QUITE LIKE 
SAMANTHA THAT A YES L. SAMANTHA I CERTAINLY HOPE SO

AREAS ONE EARTHY AREAS AND ONE 
SPIRITUAL WE HAVE SHOWN EACH AREA 
WITH THE RIGHT PLANTING IN THE 
BOYHOOD AREA THERE IS A VEGETABLE 
PATCH APPARENTLY HIS FATHER HAD AN 
ALLOTMENT

GOOD QUESTION 
LONDON TRANSPORT 
IS IT BASED ON 
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF YOURS THAT 
FIRST TIME I SAW YOU WAS ON JOOLS 
HOLLAND WHERE DID HE FIND YOU 
THAT FELT LIKE REALLY LIKE QUITE 
A BIG MOMENT FOR ME I THINK BACK BACK IN NOVEMBER WAS IT 
NOVEMBER YEAH 
EVERYONE FROM HOME DIDN'T KNOW 
WHERE I'D BEEN FOR THREE YEARS 
THERE I AM ON T. V. IT FELT LIKE NEW 
YEAR'S EVE OR SOMETHING EVERYBODY 
WAS CELEBRATING ALL THE PUBS AT 
HOME HAD PARTIES AND WATCHED ME ON 
THE BOX YOU KNOW IT'S QUITE A BIG 
NIGHT IN TERMS OF BECOMING PUBLIC 
ABOUT WHAT I DID THE REASON THEY 
ASKED ME TO DO THOSE TWO SONGS IS 
BECAUSE THEY CAME TO A REHEARSAL 
SPACE IN WEST LONDON NEAR 
SHEPHERD'S BUSH L. WAS THERE WITH 
MY GUITARIST AND BEFORE I KNEW IT 
I GOT THE CALL AND THEY SAID THEY 
WANTED ME TO DO TWO SONGS WITH A 
BAND THAT WAS AMAZING GREAT 
STARTING POINT 
WHAT I REALLY LIKE 
IS THE ALBUM IS RETRO IT TAKES ME 
BACK TO A YEAR OR TWO YOU KNOW 
PARTICULARLY LIKE MERCY YOU CAN'T 
HELP BUT DOT MASHED POTATO WERE 
YOU AIMING FOR THAT 
I NEVER 
PLANNED ANYTHING L. NEVER HAD A 
VISION ALL I WANTED WAS TO MAKE AN 
HONEST RECORD L. LIKE KIND OF 
ORGANIC OR KEST RAL NOSTALGIC 
SOUNDS I THINK THEY SEEM TO HAUNT 
ME IT UNFOLDLED THAT WAY WE DID A 
LOT OF SONGS OVER THREE YEARS 
NOBODY KNEW ABOUT ME YOU KNOW 
THERE WAS NO RUSH TO MAKE THE 
RECORD JANET LEE AND I MADE THE 
RECORD TOGETHER SHE A AND AMP RED THE 
WHOLE THING THERE WAS NO RUSH WE 
PICKED OUR TEN FAVOURITE SONGS AND 
HERE WE HAVE IT 
HOW DID SHE FIND 
YOU THEN I'M INTERESTED HOW THIS 
STARTED YOU WERE SQUIRRELED AWAY 
FOR THREE YEARS JANET KEPT YOU 
BACK WHILE YOU WERE WRITING THINGS 
HOW DID SHE FIND UP AT THE 
BEGINNING WHERE 
DID YOU START I I DID MANY THINGS THROUGH MY TEENAGE 
YEARS I WAS KIND OF DANGEROUSLY 
AMBITIOUS I BELIEVED THAT I COULD 
ACHIEVE ANYTHING I WANTED L. 
LEARNED THE HARD WAY L. GOT TO 
ABOUT EIGHTEEN AND I THOUGHT I DIDN'T 
REALLY WANT TO DO IT ANY MORE L. L. 
THOUGHT I COULDN'T FIGHT MUSIC WAS 
SO PAINFUL AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE 
BEEN PAINFUL SO I JUST BECAME A 
SINGER SHE HEARD ME SINGING ON 
DEMOS SHE ENCOURAGED ME TO WRITE 
YOU'VE BEEN VENTURING INTO AMERICA 
AND THEY LIKE YOU THERE LOOKING AT 
A SONG LIKE MERCY NOT SURPRISING 
BECAUSE THAT'S VERY AMERICAN ISN'T 
IT VERY SOULFUL 
MAYBE IT IS BUT 
I NO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MOST 
AMAZING ACHIEVEMENTS IS THAT I'M 
CROSSING OVER INTO THE HIP HOP 
SCENE I KNOW A GIRL FROM WALES 
THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN A 
GUY CALLED THE GAME HAS DONE A 
REMIX OF MERCY 
WE'RE HEARING IT AT 
THE MOMENT 
DON'T YOU WANT TO DO THAT 
I KNOW 
WHAT YOU MEAN 
SLIGHTLY MORE HIP 
HOP 
THAT'S THE MASHED POTATO HE HOP TOLD ME EARLIER 
THAT'S THE ONE 
WHERE YOU YOU KNOW GOING DOWN 
UNDER WATER AMAZING 
ALL THE AMAZING SMOOTH MOVES

HALL AMAZING ONE OF THOSE RARE 
OPPORTUNITIES
