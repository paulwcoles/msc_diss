THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS ARCHIVE FOOTAGE OF SEAL HUNTING WHICH SOME VIEWERS MAY FIND UPSETTING 
THE BORDER BETWEEN SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND 
LITTLE MARKS IT NOW BUT FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS IT WAS HOTLY DISPUTED 
THE SCENE OF BLOODY BATTLES AND COUNTLESS VIOLENT SKIRMISHES 
FOR CENTURIES MORE THIS NORTH EAST COAST HAS PLAYED A DEFINING ROLE 
IN SHAPING THE ISLAND NATION WE ARE TODAY 
TRAVELLING WITH ME ON THIS JOURNEY ARE OUR USUAL GROUP OF EXPERTS 
ALICE ROBERTS JOINS A TEAM REBUILDING BRITAIN'S EARLIEST HOUSE 
ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND YEARS OLDER THAN THE PYRAMIDS 
NEIL OLIVER UNRAVELS A STORY OF RACIAL TENSION IN ONE OF OUR HISTORIC PORTS 
MIRANDA KRESTOVNIKOFF DISCOVERS HOW OUR SEALS ARE RECOVERING 
FROM BEING HUNTED ALMOST TO EXTINCTION 
I GET THE CHANCE TO EXPLORE SOME OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL SHIPS ON OUR COAST 
IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING JOURNEY SO FAR 
BUT THERE'S STILL SO MUCH MORE TO DISCOVER 
THIS IS THE STORY OF COAST 
THIS LEG OF OUR JOURNEY TAKES US FROM BERWICK UPON TWEED SOUTH TO WHITBY 
IT'S A ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILE JOURNEY THAT CROSSES FOUR MAJOR RIVERS 
AND TWO DISTINCT IDENTITIES 
THE UNSPOILT NORTH ONCE THE SEAT OF POWER IN ENGLAND 
AND THE INDUSTRIAL SOUTH ONCE THE POWERHOUSE OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
NOW THOUGH THE DRAMA THAT HAS BEEN PLAYED OUT IN THE NORTH EAST OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
IS RATHER OVERLOOKED 
WELCOME TO A FORGOTTEN COAST 
THIS IS BERWICK UPON TWEED 
ONLY A STONE'S THROW FROM THE SCOTTISH BORDER 
THIS FORTRESS TOWN MARKS THE BEGINNING 
OF THE NEXT LEG OF OUR JOURNEY 
BERWICK IS NOW THE NORTHERNMOST TOWN IN ENGLAND 
IN MANY WAYS IT'S OVERSHADOWED BY ITS NEAREST NEIGHBOUR EDINBURGH 
JUST FIFTY MILES AWAY 
TODAY IT'S A PRETTY MARKET TOWN 
BUT DON'T BE FOOLED BY ITS UNASSUMING CHARM 
THE PICTURE BOOK SERENITY OF BERWICK UPON TWEED 
BELIES ITS VIOLENT PAST 
THE KEY TO THAT PAST IS ITS LOCATION 
THE RIVER TWEED IS A NATURAL BORDER BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND 
BERWICK HAS THIS INCREDIBLY STRATEGIC LOCATION RIGHT AT THE MOUTH OF THE TWEED 
IT WAS CONSTANTLY FOUGHT OVER BY THE TWO COUNTRIES 
IN THIRTY YEARS IT CHANGED HANDS THIRTEEN TIMES AND FOR A VERY GOOD REASON 
BEFORE EDWARD I CAPTURED IT FOR ENGLAND IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX 
BERWICK WAS THE RICHEST AND MOST IMPORTANT PORT IN SCOTLAND 
FACING EAST IT WAS IDEALLY PLACED FOR SCOTLAND'S TRADE WITH NORTHERN EUROPE 
EXPORTING WOOL GRAIN AND SALMON 
IN RETURN TRADERS FROM GERMANY FLANDERS AND THE BALTIC STATES 
MADE BERWICK A THRIVING COSMOPOLITAN CENTRE 
THAT PROSPERITY MADE IT A HUGELY DESIRABLE PRIZE 
CAUGHT IN A FIERCE BATTLE BETWEEN ENGLISHMAN AND SCOT 
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN BLOOD AND ASH FELL HERE MORE FREQUENTLY THAN RAIN 
EVEN AFTER THE SO CALLED PERPETUAL PEACE OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWO 
WHICH FOUND BERWICK BACK IN ENGLISH HANDS 
THE SCOTS STILL EYED IT JEALOUSLY 
TO SECURE BERWICK ONCE AND FOR ALL FOR ENGLAND 
ELIZABETH I BUILT THESE MASSIVE RAMPARTS 
THEY WERE THE SINGLE MOST EXPENSIVE PROJECT OF HER REIGN 
AND THEY COST A WHOPPING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND 
MORE MONEY WAS SPENT HERE THAN ON DEFENDING THE REALM AGAINST THE SPANISH ARMADA 
BERWICK HAD TO BE IMPREGNABLE 
ELIZABETH HIRED THE FINEST MILITARY ENGINEERS FROM ITALY 
BEHIND THESE STONE CLAD WALLS IS COMPACTED EARTH INTENDED TO ABSORB THE IMPACT OF CANNON FIRE 
THE COMPLICATED THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY OF THE RAMPARTS 
IS THE RESULT OF CUTTING EDGE RENAISSANCE MATHEMATICS 
THESE DEFENCES SERVE AS A REMINDER OF JUST HOW IMPORTANT BERWICK ONCE WAS 
THE QUEEN WAS PREPARED TO SPEND FORTUNES DEFENDING A TOWN 
WHOSE STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE HAS NOW BEEN FORGOTTEN 
JUST ELEVEN MILES FURTHER DOWN THE COAST 
IS THE TIDAL ISLAND OF LINDISFARNE 
LONG BEFORE THE ENGLISH AND SCOTS DID BATTLE ANOTHER WAR RAGED 
NOT FOR LAND BUT FOR THE VERY SOUL OF THE NORTHUMBRIAN PEOPLE 
ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO AS THE ROMAN EMPIRE WITHDREW FROM BRITAIN 
OUR CHRISTIAN BELIEFS WENT WITH IT 
THE FORCES OF PAGANISM AGAIN RULED BRITAIN 
BUT HERE ON THE HOLY ISLE OF LINDISFARNE TWO MONKS WERE AMONG THE FIRST TO FIGHT BACK 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO BE AFFECTED BY THE OTHER WORLDLY ATMOSPHERE OF THIS PLACE 
TWICE EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS ITS DOORS ARE SLAMMED SHUT NOT BY MAN BUT BY THE FORCES OF NATURE 
SOMEHOW BECAUSE OF THE TIDES LINDISFARNE NOW FEELS VERY REMOTE 
YET WHEN IRISH MONK AIDAN EVENTUALLY TO BECOME SAINT AIDAN CAME HERE 
ISOLATION IS NOT WHAT HE WANTED AT ALL 
THE MONKS WHO ARRIVED HERE TO ESTABLISH A SITE IN AD SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
DIDN'T COME BECAUSE IT WAS A SANCTUARY 
AIDAN AND HIS FOLLOWERS WERE ON A MISSION TO TRANSFORM NORTHUMBRIA AND BEYOND 
LINDISFARNE WAS THEIR LAUNCH PAD TO CONVERT THOUSANDS OF PAGAN ENGLISH TO CHRISTIANITY 
CANON KATE TRISTRAM HAS WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THE FIRST MONKS ON LINDISFARNE 
AIDAN CHOSE THIS ISLAND 
FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW IT WAS A PERFECT CHOICE 
IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE REMOTE 
HE WANTED TO MEET AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE 
AND AT LOW TIDE PEOPLE COULD DO WHAT THEY DO NOW 
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO CAUSEWAY THERE WERE HARD RIDGES OF SAND 
THEY COULD COME WALKING OR RIDING THEIR HORSES 
IN THOSE DAYS EVERYBODY WHO COULD TRAVEL BY SEA DID SO IT WAS SAFER 
THE MAINLAND WAS THICKLY WOODED 
THE WOODS HAD DANGEROUS WILD ANIMALS IN THEM WOLVES AND BOARS AND THINGS 
AND DANGEROUS WILD PEOPLE 
IT WAS SAFER IF YOU COULD TO COAST DOWN THE COAST IN YOUR LITTLE BOATS 
SO WE MUST IMAGINE THE SEA OUT THERE ABSOLUTELY FULL OF LITTLE BOATS 
ALL FLOATING INTO THE HARBOUR AT HIGH TIDE 
THIS ISLAND WAS ON THE EDGE OF A SUPERHIGHWAY 
ABSOLUTELY IT COULD BE APPROACHED FROM EITHER DIRECTION 
LINDISFARNE'S IDEAL POSITION SERVED AIDAN AND HIS MONKS WELL 
TRAVELLING ON FOOT ALL OVER NORTHUMBRIA 
THEY WORKED TIRELESSLY TO CONVERT THE LOCAL PAGANS 
BETWEEN THEM THEY CONVERTED A LOT OF ENGLAND 
SAINT AIDAN SET UP THIS BASE AS A MISSIONARY TRAINING COLLEGE 
HE FOUND ENGLISH BOYS AND HE TRAINED THEM IN HIS OWN MISSIONARY METHODS 
THEN WHEN THEY GREW UP THEY WERE SENT OUT 
THEY WENT ACROSS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND ACROSS THE MIDLANDS 
AND SOME TO THE DEEP SOUTH 
SAINT WILFRED WHO CONVERTED THE LAST ENGLISH KINGDOM TO BE CONVERTED 
WHICH WAS SUSSEX WAS A BOY TRAINED HERE 
ACCORDING TO LEGEND EVEN IN DEATH AIDAN WAS A POTENT FORCE 
THE VISION OF HIS BODY RISING TO HEAVEN 
IS SAID TO HAVE INSPIRED HIS MOST FAMOUS SUCCESSOR CUTHBERT 
A LOCAL LAD WHO CONTINUED AIDAN'S WORK 
RECOGNISED AS A SAINT AFTER HIS DEATH 
WHAT WAS TO BECOME THE MOST ILLUMINATED GOSPEL IN BRITAIN 
WAS CREATED FOR SAINT CUTHBERT'S SHRINE 
THIS IS A FACSIMILE COPY OF THE LINDISFARNE GOSPELS 
THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED YEAR OLD ORIGINAL IS LYING IN A VAULT IN THE BRITISH LIBRARY 
IT'S ONE OF ENGLAND'S GREATEST NATIONAL TREASURES 
THE WORK OF JUST ONE MONK THE GOSPELS ARE A MUCH VENERATED RELIGIOUS RELIC 
LEAFING THROUGH THIS COPY 
YOU GET A REAL FEEL FOR THE SCRIBE WHO SAT HERE ON LINDISFARNE 
CREATING THIS REMARKABLE BOOK 
IT'S AN ASTONISHING WORK OF DEDICATION 
THE IMAGERY USED THROUGHOUT THE GOSPELS 
DRAWS FROM DIVERSE INFLUENCES ON THE CHURCH AT THAT TIME 
IT WAS SEEN AS A POWERFUL UNIFYING STATEMENT THEN 
AND ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS LATER IT'S A REMINDER THAT THE TWO SAINTS OF LINDISFARNE WERE PIVOTAL 
IN BRING CHRISTIANITY IN ENGLAND BACK FROM THE BRINK 
THAT THE GOSPELS SURVIVED AT ALL THOUGH IS A MINOR MIRACLE 
IN JUST OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER CUTHBERT'S DEATH 
LINDISFARNE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES IN THE COUNTRY TO BE ATTACKED BY VIKINGS 
WALKING ALONG THIS DESERTED BEACH TODAY BESIDE AN EMPTY SEA 
YOU'D NEVER THINK THERE HAD BEEN A TIME 
WHEN THIS TINY ISLAND HAD BEEN SO WELL CONNECTED AND SO INFLUENTIAL 
THAT IT PLAYED A STARRING ROLE IN REJUVENATING A CHRISTIAN ENGLAND THAT WE KNOW TODAY 
LINDISFARNE'S INFLUENCE IS FAR REACHING 
BUT SAINT AIDAN AND HIS MONKS DIDN'T ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL ALONE 
THEY HAD FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES 
ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS PRACTICAL SUPPORT WAS PROVIDED BY THE LOCAL RULER KING OSWALD 
BACK ON THE MAINLAND IS HIS HOME BAMBURGH 
NOW ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS CASTLES IN BRITAIN 
BUT AS MARK HORTON DISCOVERS VERY LITTLE OF OSWALD'S CASTLE REMAINS 
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC PLACES ON BRITAIN'S COASTLINE 
THE GREAT NORMAN CASTLE OF BAMBURGH 
BUT WE'RE ALSO IN THE HEART OF THE ANGLO SAXON KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA 
THIS CASTLE WAS AT ITS MOST POWERFUL BEFORE THERE WAS EVEN AN ENGLAND 
DURING THE TIME OF THE ANGLO SAXONS ANGLELAND AS IT WAS THEN KNOWN 
WAS DIVIDED UP INTO SEVEN MAJOR KINGDOMS 
OF WHICH NORTHUMBRIA WAS THE MOST POWERFUL 
THE SIXTH CENTURY KINGS OF NORTHUMBRIA CHOSE THIS ROCK TO BE THEIR CAPITAL 
AND WHAT A ROCK 
THE HUGE BASALT CRAG THAT BAMBURGH CASTLE STANDS ON WAS CHOSEN FOR ITS COMMANDING POSITION 
CONNECTED TO THE SEA BY A NATURAL HARBOUR 
IT WAS VISIBLE ALONG THE COAST FOR MILES 
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS GRAHAM YOUNG HAS BEEN EXPLORING BENEATH ITS MAGNIFICENT FACADE 
GRAHAM I CAN LOOK AROUND AND SEE ALL THESE LUMPS OF MASONRY 
BUT PRESUMABLY THESE ARE NORMAN OR LATER YES 
THE MAJORITY OF THE STANDING STRUCTURE IS THE LAST ONE THOUSAND YEARS 
SO WHERE'S THE SAXON 
WELL UNDER THE GROUND 
WE KNOW IT'S HERE BECAUSE IT'S WRITTEN ABOUT IN DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE 
WE'VE BEEN EXCAVATING WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ANGLO SAXON FEATURES AT THIS LEVEL 
THERE ARE PITS AND POST HOLES AND SO FORTH 
THE EVIDENCE IS THAT WHEN WE STOP SEEING POTTERY WE'RE GETTING BACK INTO THE FIRST MILLENNIUM AD 
OUR PRIME DATING EVIDENCE IS THE ABSENCE OF THINGS 
WHAT ABOUT THIS WALL I PRESUME IT'S A WALL IT IS 
IT'S A RUBBLE FOUNDATION TO WHAT IS A MASSIVE TIMBER STRUCTURE 
PROBABLY PART OF THE GATE COMPLEX 
THE FIRST DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF A FORTRESS HERE IS IN THE YEAR FIVE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
AND GRAHAM'S FIND MAY WELL DATE BACK TO THAT TIME 
THE REASON THAT THERE'S SO LITTLE OF THAT ANGLO SAXON FORTRESS LEFT 
IS THAT AFTER PILLAGING LINDISFARNE 
THE VIKINGS HIT BAMBURGH 
IN THE YEAR NINE HUNDRED NINETY THREE THE ORIGINAL FORTRESS WAS RAZED TO THE GROUND 
BUT IT WASN'T A RUIN FOR LONG 
WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR'S FORCES ARRIVED IN ENGLAND IN ONE THOUSAND SIXTY SIX 
AND WITHIN FIFTY YEARS THEY HAD MADE BAMBURGH CASTLE GREAT AGAIN 
THAT IT'S IN SUCH GOOD CONDITION TODAY NEARLY ONE THOUSAND YEARS LATER 
IS NOT QUITE AS SURPRISING AS IT FIRST APPEARS 
THIS MAY SEEM TO BE THE QUINTESSENTIAL MEDIAEVAL CASTLE 
BUT THE ONLY REALLY GENUINE BIT IS THIS NORMAN KEEP 
MOST OF THE REST WAS REBUILT BY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY INDUSTRIALIST LORD ARMSTRONG 
AS A FAIRYTALE CASTLE 
AND THAT'S THIS CASTLE'S SECRET 
BECAUSE DESPITE ITS OUTWARD APPEARANCE 
BAMBURGH WAS LAST USED IN ANGER OVER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
ATTACKED DURING THE WAR OF THE ROSES 
IT SOON FELL INTO RUINS AND HAS NEVER REGAINED ITS POWERFUL STATUS 
ITS FINAL ABANDONMENT BY JAMES I REFLECTS THE DECLINE IN THIS AREA'S FORTUNES 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
AS THE POLITICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE BORDER REGIONS EBBED AWAY 
JUST TWO MILES OFF THE COAST AT BAMBURGH LIE THE FARNE ISLANDS 
BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND MORE THAN TWENTY OF THEM DEPENDING ON THE TIDE 
RUGGED EXPOSED AND FORMIDABLY BLEAK 
FOR CENTURIES THESE ISLANDS HAVE BEEN HOME TO OUR LARGEST NATIVE MAMMAL THE GREY SEAL 
OUR ZOOLOGIST 
HAS JOINED THE WARDENS IN THEIR ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE HEALTH OF THE LOCAL SEAL POPULATION 
OUR JOB IS TO MONITOR THE BIRTH AND DEATH RATES OF THE SEALS 
THE BRITISH COASTLINE USED TO BE HOME TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GREY SEALS 
BUT WE'VE BEEN HUNTING THEM FOR CENTURIES 
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THERE WERE AS FEW AS FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS SURVIVING AROUND OUR COASTLINE 
IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN PARLIAMENT PASSED THE GREY SEALS PROTECTION ACT 
THE FIRST EVER LEGISLATION TO PROTECT A MAMMAL IN THIS COUNTRY 
HUNTING SEALS FOR THEIR FUR WAS OUTLAWED 
BUT MANY BLAMED THE RECOVERING SEAL POPULATION FOR THE COLLAPSE IN LOCAL FISH STOCKS 
PARLIAMENT LEGISLATED AGAIN AND HUNTING GREY SEALS WAS ALLOWED 
IT CONTINUED RIGHT INTO THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
UNTIL A PUBLIC OUTCRY ONCE AGAIN PUT A STOP TO THE KILLING 
SINCE THEN THE NUMBER OF SEALS HAS BEEN CLOSELY MONITORED 
YOU CAN SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO GET CLOSE TO ONE OF THEM 
THEY DON'T RUN AWAY EASY PICKINGS FOR THE HUNTERS UNFORTUNATELY 
THEY'RE ALMOST PATHETIC THESE ANIMALS 
I CAN ALMOST COME WITHIN A FOOT IT'S NOT BOTHERED IF THE ADULT IS AWAY AT SEA 
DOES IT NOT MAKE YOUR JOB EASIER WHEN YOU'RE MARKING THEM 
IT DOES THIS IS QUITE A GOOD ONE 
IT'S REAL EASY HOWEVER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ISLANDS WHERE A LOT OF FEMALES HAUL OUT 
THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEMS START 
DAVID AND HIS TEAM MARK THE NEWBORN PUPS WITH A COLOURED DYE SO THEY KNOW WHICH ONES THEY'VE COUNTED 
AND THEN THEY CAN ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF SEALS ON THE ISLANDS 
AND THAT DOESN'T HARM THE SEAL PUP 
NOT AT ALL BEFORE THE MOTHER COMES BACK WE'LL JUST RETREAT 
THE PUPS ONLY KEEP THEIR WHITE FUR FOR ABOUT TWENTY ONE DAYS BEFORE SHEDDING IT 
AND GAINING THEIR PRISTINE ADULT COAT FREE OF DAVID'S DYE 
AFTER WE'VE DONE OUR WORK IT'S GOOD TO SEE IT'S NOT HAD MUCH EFFECT ON THEM 
THEN YOU CAN ENJOY THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL 
DAVID HAS RECORDED THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN PUPS SO FAR THIS YEAR 
AND WITH HUNDREDS LEFT TO COUNT HE ESTIMATES THAT THE FARNE ISLANDS MAY BE HOME TO THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED GREY SEALS 
COUNTING THEM ON LAND IS ONE THING BUT I WANT TO SEE THEM AT THEIR BEST 
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DO THAT 
LOOK THERE'S ONE 
ON LAND THEY SEEM CUMBERSOME BUT HERE THEY'RE LIKE ANOTHER ANIMAL 
THEY SHOOT THROUGH THE WATER LIKE A BULLET 
LOOK AT THAT FACE WITH THOSE BIG EYES 
HE FEEDS DOWN IN THE DEPTHS ABOUT FIFTY METRES 
THE LIGHT DOESN'T PENETRATE VERY MUCH 
THERE WAS ONE TUGGING AT MY FEET 
IT'S USING ITS WHISKERS TO INVESTIGATE 
THEY ARE SO INQUISITIVE 
I THINK THEY ARE JUST PLAYING WITH US 
THE CONSERVATION OF SEALS IS A GREAT SUCCESS STORY FOR THE U. K. COAST 
PROTECTION HAS SEEN THE POPULATION RECOVER FROM NEAR EXTINCTION 
NOW OUR SHORES ARE HOME TO NEARLY HALF THE WORLD'S POPULATION OF GREY SEALS 
HOW MAGICAL IS THAT 
ABOUT TEN MILES DUE SOUTH OF THE SEALS ON THE FARNE ISLANDS 
IS THE RUIN OF A CASTLE THAT DIDN'T GET A VICTORIAN MAKEOVER 
BUILT IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
DUNSTANBURGH WAS AN EXTRAVAGANT CONSTRUCTION 
DESIGNED TO REMIND LOCALS AND NOBLES ALIKE OF CAMELOT 
TODAY ITS CRUMBLING PRESENCE STILL TOWERS ABOVE THE ALMOST DESERTED HARBOUR AT CRASTER 
THE FISHERMEN MAY HAVE LEFT BUT ONE BUSINESS IS STILL THRIVING 
ALAN ROBSON IS CARRYING ON HIS FAMILY'S TRADITION 
SMOKING KIPPERS LIKE HIS FATHER AND HIS GRANDFATHER BEFORE HIM 
THIS HERRING YARD OF OURS WAS BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY SIX 
IT'S BEEN A TRADITION FOR SMALL VILLAGES TO SMOKE FISH TO LAST OUT THE WINTER 
WE HADN'T THE TRANSPORT WE HAVE NOW HOW LONG HAVE YOU WORKED HERE SINCE I LEFT SCHOOL 
MANY YEARS AGO 
I DID NATIONAL SERVICE 
AND THEN STRAIGHT BACK INTO THE BUSINESS 
THIS WAS A VERY PARTICULAR AREA VERY RICH IN HERRING 
THE HERRING CAME IN TO SPAWN 
AND JUST BEFORE THE HERRING SPAWNED THEY WERE AT THEIR BEST THEY HAD A HIGH OIL CONTENT 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM 
JUST AFTER THE WAR IT WAS OVER FISHED 
AND WHEN WE JOINED THE COMMON MARKET 
THEY BANNED HERRING FISHING IN THIS AREA AND MOST OF THE BOATS HAD TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO 
SO THEY NEVER GOT BACK TO IT 
SO WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR HERRINGS FROM 
UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF IT'S FROM NORWAY ICELAND 
WE GET THE HERRING DEFROST THEM 
THEN THEY GO ON TO A MACHINE WHICH SPLITS THE HERRING 
AND IT CLEANS THEM 
AND THEN FROM THERE THEY GO TO THE SMOKE HOUSE 
THEY ARE PUT UP INTO THE RACKS ABOVE 
ONE CHAP HANDS THEM UP 
AND THE OTHER ONE IS THERE HANGING ON TO THE RACKS 
THEY ARE TRADITIONALLY SMOKED WITH WHITE WOOD SHAVINGS AND OAK SAWDUST 
WE DON'T USE CHEMICALS TO COLOUR 
THEY LITERALLY STRIKE A MATCH AND LIGHT THE WOODCHIPS YES 
AS IT BURNS ONTO THE SAWDUST YOU GET THE SMOKE 
IT TAKES ABOUT THREE HOURS FOR THE FIRES TO BURN 
YOU RENEW THEM THEN POSSIBLY AFTER THREE SETS OF FIRES THE KIPPERS ARE READY TO COME OUT 
THEY GO IN AS HERRING AND COME OUT AS KIPPERS 
AND HOW DOES THE PROCESS YOU USE DIFFER FROM YOUR GRANDFATHER'S 
NO WAY AT ALL EXCEPT THE MACHINE FOR SPLITTING THE HERRING 
THE GIRLS USED TO SPLIT THEM BY HAND NOW THE MACHINE SPLITS THEM 
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE THE SAME WAY 
LONG BEFORE PEOPLE WERE SMOKING FISH OR BUILDING CASTLES HERE 
THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT HOWICK ONE MILES FROM CRASTER 
IS WHERE WE AS PEOPLE STARTED BUILDING HOMES 
TWO YEARS AGO A RAMBLER STUMBLED OVER SOME FRAGMENTS OF FLINT STICKING OUT OF THE CLIFF EDGE 
THAT DISCOVERY LED A TEAM OF ARCHAEOLOGISTS 
TO UNEARTH THE REMAINS OF A WOODEN HOUSE 
PAINSTAKING WORK LED THEM TO BELIEVE THEY WERE THE REMAINS OF A STONE AGE SETTLEMENT 
NOW THE SAME ARCHAEOLOGISTS JOINED BY ALICE ROBERTS ARE BACK TO TEST THEIR THEORY 
AND RECREATE WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS BRITAIN'S FIRST HOUSE 
THIS PROJECT IS SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL TO ME 
THE CHANCE TO RECREATE A STONE AGE STRUCTURE 
ON ITS ORIGINAL SITE FROM TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
DISCOVERING HOW TO BUILD THE HOUSE SHOULD GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO AN ANCIENT WORLD 
WHICH IS OTHERWISE HARD TO IMAGINE 
AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF RESEARCH 
DOCTOR CLIVE WADDINGTON BELIEVES THAT THIS HOUSE WILL CHANGE OUR UNDERSTANDING 
OF HOW STONE AGE HUNTER GATHERERS LIVED 
THIS IS THE EARLIEST EVIDENCE WE HAVE 
OF A DWELLING STRUCTURE IN THIS PART OF BRITAIN 
IT'S THE EARLIEST EVIDENCE OF PEOPLE HERE 
WHY ARE YOU RECREATING IT 
IT'S GIVING US A CHANCE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE EXCAVATED 
AND PUT THAT INTO PRACTICE TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE AS A BUILT STRUCTURE AND WHETHER IT WORKS 
SO WE'RE TESTING OUR INTERPRETATION OF THE EXCAVATED EVIDENCE 
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW THE STRUCTURE WAS LIKE THIS 
WHEN WE WERE EXCAVATING WE FOUND CHARRED CIRCLES IN THE GROUND WHERE THE POSTS HAD STOOD 
AND ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE HUT JUST ROUND THE EDGE 
WE FOUND THESE STAKE HOLES WHICH WERE ANGLED TOWARDS THE APEX OF THE ROOF 
WE CAN MEASURE FROM THE ANGLES OF THOSE STAKE HOLES WHAT THE PITCH WAS 
THEY WERE AROUND SIXTY FIVE DEGREES WHICH MADE FOR A REALLY STEEP ROOF 
I'M BEGINNING TO SEE HOW THE HOUSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED 
BUT I DON'T HAVE A PICTURE OF WHAT THE AREA AROUND THE HOUSE WAS LIKE 
BY EXTRACTING CORE SAMPLES FROM THE SOIL 
IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET REMARKABLY DETAILED INFORMATION 
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS FROM THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
SO YOU TAKE IT OUT A METRE AT A TIME 
WE TRY TO 
THE UPPER PARTS OF THE CORE 
ARE QUITE STIFF SO WE MIGHT NOT GET A METRE IN ONE GO 
THINK OF THIS LIKE A TIME MACHINE THE DEEPER DOWN WE GO THE FURTHER BACK IN TIME WE TRAVEL 
WE MIGHT SEE SOME EVIDENCE OF VICTORIAN ENGINEERING HERE 
THIS IS A VICTORIAN PATH IT COULD BE 
BY ANALYSING THE PLANT REMAINS POLLEN AND TINY ORGANISMS CONTAINED WITHIN THE LAYERS OF SEDIMENT 
WE CAN BUILD UP A DETAILED PICTURE OF HOW THE LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
WE'RE DEFINITELY IN THE WATER TABLE 
THAT'S A BIG PIECE OF VERY OLD WOOD 
ABUT SIX THOUSAND YEARS OLD 
LOOKS QUITE FRESH IT DOES IT'S AMAZING 
THE SEDIMENT AT TEN METRES REVEALS THAT ABOUT TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
THE VEGETATION IN THIS AREA WAS RECOVERING FROM THE ICE AGE 
USING INFORMATION FROM THE CORE SAMPLES 
AND FROM HIS EXCAVATION CLIVE HAS BUILT A PICTURE OF THE WORLD OUR STONE AGE ANCESTORS LIVED IN 
WE RECKON THE SEA WAS UP TO FIFTEEN METRES LOWER THAN IT IS TODAY 
SO IT WAS ABOUT ONE K. M. FURTHER OUT 
SO WOULD OUR HUT HAVE BEEN VISIBLE IN THE SAME WAY IT IS TODAY 
I THINK SO BECAUSE THE LAND WOULD HAVE SHELVED OFF GRADUALLY 
THE LINE OF HILLS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST HILLS YOU'D HAVE SEEN APPROACHING FROM THE SEA 
ON TOP OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE HUT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE FROM A DISTANCE OUT 
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY CHOSE THIS AREA 
THERE ARE MANY REASONS BUT THE KEY TO IT WAS THAT IT WAS ON THE CUSP OF SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL ZONES 
SO OUT TO SEA YOU HAVE THE MARINE LIFE WHICH ATTRACTS BIRDS 
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE SHORE WITH SHELLFISH AND BASKING SEALS 
AND THEN INLAND AMONGST THAT WOODLAND 
YOU'D HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS LIKE A NATURAL LARDER FOR HUNTER GATHERERS 
I'M BUILDING UP A PICTURE OF WHAT THIS PLACE MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
HOW SOPHISTICATED THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HOUSE IS AND THE TEAMWORK INVOLVED IN BUILDING IT 
THERE'S THIS IDEA OF STONE AGE PEOPLE BEING PRETTY BACKWARD 
LIVING IN CAVES FLINTSTONES 
THEY ARE PEOPLE AND NO LESS INTELLIGENT THAN WE ARE 
IT WAS JUST A DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE INGENIOUS LIVING ON THE EDGE 
THERE'S ALL THESE SKILLS WE'VE LOST MAKING THE STRING 
THIS IS A REALLY ROBUST CONSTRUCTION 
AND STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE TRADITIONAL IDEA 
OF MESOLITHIC PEOPLE BUILDING ONLY TEMPORARY AND RELATIVELY FLIMSY SHELTERS 
LIKE THE ONE FOUND AT GOATSCRAG TEN MILES INLAND 
ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXCAVATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT IN THE MESOLITHIC 
PEOPLE USED THIS ROCK SHELTER AS A TEMPORARY CAMP 
BUT THE THING WHICH BRINGS ME CLOSEST TO THESE PEOPLE IS THE ART 
THEIR IMAGES OF ANIMALS ARE PRETTY CRUDE BUT IT DOES FOR ME 
JUST STRIP AWAY THAT TEN THOUSAND YEARS 
IT'S WONDERFUL 
DESPITE THE WORSENING WEATHER THE HOUSE IS REALLY COMING TOGETHER 
AND ALTHOUGH THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE ISN'T CLEAR ON WHAT THE ROOF WAS MADE OF 
THIS SPIDER'S WEB OF BIRCH TWIGS AND HAZEL IS SO STRONG 
THAT IT'S LIKELY IT WAS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT SOMETHING HEAVY LIKE TURF 
FINALLY THE WEATHER TURNED AGAINST US BUT WE'D COME SO FAR 
THERE WAS NO STOPPING US NOW 
WITH THE BUILD COMPLETE 
CLIVE HAS ONE MORE PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT POINTS TO THIS 
BEING A PERMANENT DWELLING FOR STONE AGE HUNTER GATHERERS 
WE FOUND A SERIES OF HEARTHS IN THE CENTRE OF THE BUILDING 
AND THERE WAS A SUCCESSION OF THEM THE LATEST ONES AT THE TOP AND EARLIEST ONES AT THE BOTTOM 
AND WE FOUND HAZELNUTS INSIDE EACH OF THESE HEARTHS 
HAZELNUTS ONLY LIVE FOR ONE YEAR 
SO WE DID ALL OUR CARBON DATES ON HAZELNUTS 
AND THEY'VE ALLOWED US TO DATE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF OCCUPATION 
AND HOW LONG THE HUT WAS OCCUPIED FOR SO HOW LONG WAS IT OCCUPIED 
THE HUT WAS OCCUPIED FOR SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF TWO HUNDRED YEARS 
SEVERAL GENERATIONS MANY LIFETIMES IN FACT 
AND IT'S THAT THAT MAKES THIS HOUSE SO SPECIAL 
THE PROOF THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED 
FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS 
HAS FORCED PEOPLE TO REVISE THEIR THEORIES 
ABOUT OUR STONE AGE ANCESTORS TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
RATHER THAN BEING NOMADIC AS WAS PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED 
THESE PEOPLE WERE BUILDING COMPLEX HOUSES LIKE THIS ONE 
AND CALLING THEM HOME 
SOUTH OF HOWICK THE NATURE OF THE COAST BEGINS TO CHANGE 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT BUT THIS BEAUTIFUL STRETCH OF DRURIDGE BAY 
MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE HEART AND SOUL OF OUR INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE 
FOR THE NEXT FORTY FIVE MILES ALONG TO HARTLEPOOL 
INDUSTRY AND ENGINEERING SHAPED THE FACE OF THIS COAST 
JUST OUT THERE SOME EIGHTY METRES BELOW THE SEA BED IS A TUNNEL 
THAT USED TO BE PART OF A COAL MINE THAT STRETCHED FOR EIGHT MILES OUT TO SEA 
ON A QUIET DAY THE MINERS COULD HEAR SHIPS PASSING OVERHEAD 
THAT MINE'S CLOSED AS ARE THE DEEP PITS THAT FUELLED THE INDUSTRIAL BOOM OF THE NORTH EAST COAST 
COAL FUELLED THE FACTORIES THE STEEL WORKS 
THE TRAINS THE SHIPYARDS AND THE SHIPS 
COAL BROUGHT PROSPERITY AND PRIDE 
TO ALL THE GREAT CITIES OF THE NORTH EAST 
AND THAT COAL WAS CREATED THREE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO 
BACK THEN IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED A LITTLE DIFFERENT AROUND HERE 
FOR A START WE'D HAVE BEEN ON THE EQUATOR AND ALL THIS 
WOULD HAVE BEEN TROPICAL RAIN FOREST 
OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS THE CONTINENTS MOVED 
THE TREES FELL AND WERE TRANSFORMED BY THE IMMENSE HEAT AND PRESSURE 
OF GEOLOGICAL FORCES AND THE RESULT IS THIS 
OUT THERE THE COAL SEAMS RISE RIGHT UP THE SEA BED 
WHERE THE INCREDIBLE POUNDING AND SUCKING OF THE WATER 
BREAKS THE COAL UP AND WASHES IT ASHORE HERE FOR THE TAKING 
THIS WHOLE STRETCH OF COAST THRIVED ON THE COAL 
FOR WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS 
JOBS WERE PLENTIFUL 
AND PLACES LIKE WHITLEY BAY GREW INTO BUSTLING HOLIDAY DESTINATIONS FOR THE LOCAL MINERS 
TODAY IT'S SURVIVING WITHOUT THE COAL 
AS THE STAG AND HEN PARTY CAPITAL OF THE NORTH EAST 
BUT WHILE THE BLACK STUFF WAS COMING OUT OF THE GROUND 
EVERYWHERE ALONG THIS COAST HAD A ROLE TO PLAY 
THE RIVER TYNE WAS A MAJOR ARTERY 
FOR TRANSPORTING COAL TO THE REST OF ENGLAND AND OUT TO EUROPE 
THIS STRETCH OF WATER HAS SEEN CENTURIES OF PASSING TRAFFIC 
EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS AGO SMALL BOATS FROM HERE WERE COASTING DOWN TO THE THAMES LADEN WITH COAL FOR THE CAPITAL 
BY NINETEEN HUNDRED SOUTH SHIELDS 
OVER THE MOUTH OF THE TYNE THERE 
HAD BECOME A BOOMING PORT 
LIKE PROSPEROUS PORTS EVERYWHERE IT WAS A MULTICULTURAL MELTING POT 
HISTORIAN NEIL OLIVER TAKES A TRIP BACK IN TIME 
TO UNCOVER ONE OF THE LARGELY FORGOTTEN STORIES 
OF THIS HISTORIC PORT 
WHEN YOU COME TO A NEW PLACE 
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE LOCAL PAPER 
THE SAME WITH HISTORY THE ARCHIVES OF THE LOCAL RAG ARE TIME CAPSULES 
FOR ATTITUDES AND EVENTS 
THIS IS AN EXTRACT FROM THE SOUTH SHIELDS GAZETTE 
FROM SIXTEENTH APRIL NINETEEN THIRTEEN 
THE SUGGESTION WHICH HAS COME FROM MORE THAN ONE PROSECUTION RECENTLY HEARD BY MAGISTRATES 
THAT AN ARAB COLONY IS MATERIALISING IN OUR MIDST 
IN HOLBORN TO BE PRECISE 
IS EXCITING SOME ATTENTION AND NOT UNDESERVEDLY SO 
BRITISH PORTS ATTRACTED SEAMEN OF MANY NATIONALITIES 
FROM RIGHT ACROSS THE EMPIRE 
BUT MANY OF THE ARABS IN SOUTH SHIELDS CAME FROM ADEN 
AN IMPORTANT PORT IN THE MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRY OF YEMEN 
ADEN WAS OCCUPIED BY THE BRITISH IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY NINE 
AND THIRTY YEARS LATER WITH THE OPENING OF THE SUEZ CANAL 
BECAME A VITAL STAGING POST ON THE JOURNEY BETWEEN THE U. K. AND INDIA 
FROM AS EARLY AS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FOUR THERE ARE RECORDS OF A FEW YEMENI SEAMEN 
LIVING IN SOUTH SHIELDS BUT THEY DIDN'T COME IN NUMBERS UNTIL THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
DRAWN BY INCENTIVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
THEY WERE ENCOURAGED TO SOUTH SHIELDS TO MAKE UP FOR THE CHRONIC LACK OF LOCAL MEN WHO WERE AWAY 
FIGHTING IN THE TRENCHES 
BETWEEN NINETEEN FOURTEEN AND NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
THE POPULATION OF YEMENIS ROSE FROM A FEW DOZEN TO OVER THREE THOUSAND 
AFTER THE WAR 
MILL DAM WAS THE EPICENTRE OF A SAILOR'S ONSHORE LIFE 
NORMAN AHMED'S FATHER WAS ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF YEMENIS 
WHO CAME HERE EVERY DAY 
NORMAN CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT THIS PLACE WAS LIKE THEN YES 
IT WOULD BE THRIVING 
HERE AT THE FEDERATION OFFICE WHERE MEN WERE SIGNING ON AND PAYING OFF 
THERE WAS FRANKIE THE NOTE CRACKER WHO USED TO CASH 
YOUR ADVANCE NOTE AND HE TOOK TWO SHILLINGS IN THE POUND 
HE MUST HAVE HAD A LOAD HE MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY RICH MAN 
BUT WE NEVER HAD ANY REASON TO GO TO HIM 
BEING IN THE ARAB COMMUNITY WE USED TO BORROW OFF EACH OTHER 
RATHER THAN GO THAT WAY 
IT WAS A BUSY LIVELY THOROUGHFARE 
THE RIVER FULL OF SHIPS YOU KNOW 
IT SEEMS OH SO DEAD NOW OH SO DEAD 
THIS IS A PICTURE OF MY FATHER 
AND MY MAM WHEN THEY WERE MARRIED 
WOW HOW DAPPER IS HE YES HE WAS VERY DAPPER 
AND THEY'RE MARRIED THERE YES THEY DON'T LOOK OLD ENOUGH 
DESPITE BEING ENCOURAGED HERE BY THE GOVERNMENT MANY OF THE ARAB SEAMEN STRUGGLED FOR SOMEWHERE TO LIVE 
THE LOCAL BOARDING HOUSE OWNERS OFTEN REFUSED THEM LODGING 
SO THEY BEGAN TO OPEN UP THEIR OWN IN AN AREA CLOSE TO MILL DAM 
CALLED HOLBORN 
THESE AREN'T REALLY THE PARTS OF TOWN THAT PEOPLE GET SENTIMENTAL ABOUT 
SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THE STREETS AND HOUSES IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS 
HAVEJUST ABOUT ALL GONE 
BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN THESE STREETS WERE FULL OF LIFE 
FOR LOCAL MEN RETURNING FROM THE WAR IT WAS A SHOCK TO DISCOVER ARABS 
TAKING THEIR JOBS BUT THAT WASN'T THE WORST OF IT 
YOU CAN TRACK THE SIMMERING DISCONTENT THROUGH THE LETTERS PAGES IN THE LOCAL PAPERS 
THERE ARE SOME HEARTFELT GRUDGES COMING TO THE FORE LOOK AT THIS 
THE ARABS CAN ALWAYS BE RELIED UPON TO PICK THE PRETTIEST GIRLS 
THE UGLY DUCKLINGS BEING LEFT FOR THE WHITE MAN 
ALSO AN ARAB CAN GET A JOB WHERE A WHITE MAN HAS NOT A LOOK IN 
THEY REFUSE TO SELL THEMSELVES SO CHEAPLY THOSE TENSIONS SURFACED 
IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN NINETEEN WHEN WHITE AND ARAB SAILORS CLASHED 
AS BRITAIN SLID TOWARDS THE GREAT DEPRESSION 
JOBS BECAME SCARCE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TWO COMMUNITIES 
BEGAN TO DISINTEGRATE 
BUT IT WAS ON THE SECOND OF AUGUST NINETEEN THIRTY THAT IT ALL KICKED OFF RIGHT HERE 
JIM SLATER WAS HERE SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
AS A REPORTER FOR THE SOUTH SHIELDS GAZETTE 
HE'S NINETY FOUR NOW 
BUT REMEMBERS CLEARLY THE EVENTS OF THE DAY 
I WENT DOWN THERE AT ABOUT HALF PAST NINE 
A SATURDAY MARK YOU BANK HOLIDAY 
AND BY THE TIME I GOT THERE I WAS STOPPED THEY WOULDN'T LET ME IN 
UNTIL I SHOWED MY NUJ CARD 
THEN THEY SAID NO FURTHER THAN THE POST OFFICE 
AT THAT TIME IT HADN'T QUITE STARTED 
AS IT WAS GOING TO DO THE POWDER KEG WAS IGNITED 
WHEN TWO WHITE SAILORS WERE GIVEN JOBS ON ONE OF THE FEW SHIPS STILL WORKING 
THE SAILORS WERE OFFERED A POLICE ESCORT THROUGH THE THREATENING CROWD 
BUT ONE OF THE MEN REFUSED 
THIS PARTICULAR MAN HE WAS QUITE A BURLY INDIVIDUAL 
A BIG SIX FOOTER AND WELL BUILT 
AND HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE ANY POLICE PROTECTION 
HE WOULD GO WHERE HE WANTED TO GO AS HE HAD A RIGHT TO DO 
AND HE WAS NO DOUBT PUSHED AND SHOVED 
AND HE WOULD TRY TO SHOVE HIS WAY THROUGH 
AND A SHOVE STARTED A BLOW AND A BLOW STARTED A FIGHT 
AND THEN IT JUST ESCALATED 
THERE WAS NO HESITATION BY THE POLICE 
THEY HAD THEIR BATONS OUT 
AND THEN THEY STARTED TO RUN 
AND THEY ALL RAN AWAY AND ALL I COULD SEE 
WAS THE BODIES LYING DOWN ARABS AS WELL AS POLICE 
I WAS SHATTERED TO PUT IT MILDLY 
I NEVER EXPECTED THAT 
BUT WHEN I SAW THEM WHEN I SAW THE AFTERMATH 
I WAS BOTH HORRIFIED AND DISGUSTED THAT IT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED 
FOUR POLICEMEN WERE STABBED AND MANY MORE PEOPLE BOTH WHITE AND ARAB 
WERE INJURED ONLY TEN DAYS LATER 
SIX WHITE MEN AND TWENTY YEMENI SAILORS FOUND THEMSELVES IN COURT 
CHARGED WITH AFFRAY AND CAUSING A RIOT 
FIFTEEN OF THE YEMENI MEN WERE SENTENCED TO DEPORTATION 
AFTER SERVING TIME IN PRISON 
THE MILL DAM RIOTS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS BRITAIN'S FIRST RACE RIOT 
BUT AS ALWAYS THINGS ARE NOT EXACTLY AS THE HEADLINES SUGGEST 
BY NINETEEN THIRTY 
THERE WERE TOO MANY SAILORS HERE AND NOT ENOUGH JOBS 
IN ANY COMMUNITY THAT WAS A SITUATION THAT HAD TO COME TO A HEAD 
THIS ISN'T JUST A STORY ABOUT RACE 
I THINK THIS IS A STORY ABOUT POVERTY AND DESPERATION 
AND THE ENDS THAT PEOPLE WILL GO TO IF THEY'RE DRIVEN HARD ENOUGH 
THE ILL FEELING GENERATED BY THE RIOT COULD HAVE SPELT THE END FOR THE ARAB COMMUNITY IN SOUTH SHIELDS 
BUT MANY HAD MADE THEIR HOME HERE MARRIED LOCAL WOMEN AND BEGUN TO HAVE CHILDREN 
TODAY THE CHILDREN OF THOSE FIRST SEAMEN LIVE HERE WITH THEIR CHILDREN 
AND THE TRADITIONS AND CULTURES THAT THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM SURVIVE 
THE BIT WHICH I RATHER LIKE AS A CONCLUSION 
IS THE FACT THAT WHEN WAR WAS DECLARED THE LAST WAR 
THEY WENT TO THE SEA AND SAILED IN THE SAME SHIPS AS THE BRITISH MEN 
TAKING THE SAME RISKS AND DYING UNFORTUNATELY THE SAME DEATH 
FROM THE MOUTH OF THE TYNE 
IT'S JUST EIGHT MILES SOUTH 
TO SUNDERLAND AND ITS RIVER THE WEAR 
THIS RIVER WAS ONCE LINED WITH SHIPYARDS 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THE YARDS ON THE WEAR 
PRODUCED NEARLY AS MANY SHIPS AS ALL THE OTHER SHIPYARDS IN BRITAIN PUT TOGETHER 
SUNDERLAND WAS THE LARGEST SHIPBUILDING TOWN IN THE WORLD 
THE YARDS IN SUNDERLAND WENT FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH 
PRODUCING ONE AND A HALF MILLION TONNES OF SHIPPING 
FOR THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
SHIPBUILDING WAS THE LIFEBLOOD OF SUNDERLAND'S PROSPERITY 
AND DEFINED THE VERY IDENTITY OF THE TOWN AND ITS PEOPLE 
GENERATIONS OF FAMILIES WORKED HERE AT DOXFORD PALLION 
IT'S NOT UNTIL YOU WALK AROUND A DERELICT SHIPYARD 
THAT YOU GET A REAL SENSE OF THE LOSS 
THERE'S MORE THAN ECONOMICS AND JOBS TO SHIPBUILDING 
IT'S BEEN PART OF OUR CULTURE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
AS ISLANDERS WE NO LONGER HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO BUILD OUR OWN VESSELS 
TO LEAVE OUR OWN SHORES 
BY THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
ORDERS FOR SHIPS WERE FALLING 
AS COMPETITORS ABROAD BUILT FASTER AND CHEAPER 
USING MASS PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES JAPANESE AND KOREAN YARDS 
TURNED OUT SHIPS BY THEIR HUNDREDS 
WHILE SUNDERLAND WAS STILL CRAFTING BESPOKE BUT EXPENSIVE ONE OFFS 
AND THAT LACK OF COMPETITIVENESS TOLD 
DURING THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES SUNDERLAND'S SHIPYARDS CLOSED ONE BY ONE 
THIS IS WHERE SIX HUNDRED YEARS OF SHIPBUILDING ON THE WEAR ENDED ON THE TWELFTH DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT 
ON THAT NIGHT THE LAST SHIP BUILT IN SUNDERLAND WAS LAUNCHED FROM HERE 
TODAY NOBODY BUILDS SHIPS ON THE BANKS OF THE WEAR 
MOST OF THE SHIPS BUILT HERE ON THAT FINAL DECADE HAVE JOINED A GROWING FLEET OF VESSELS 
THAT ARE REACHING THE END OF THEIR WORKING LIVES 
NOW THE ISSUE FACING THIS COAST AND OTHERS LIKE IT AROUND THE WORLD 
IS NOT SHIPBUILDING BUT SHIP BREAKING 
SOUNDS SIMPLE ENOUGH 
USE A DISUSED SHIPBUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE TO OFFER A LIFELINE TO LOCAL HEAVY INDUSTRY 
JUST TWENTY MILES SOUTH OF SUNDERLAND IN HARTLEPOOL 
PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO DISCOVER HOW DIFFICULT SHIP BREAKING CAN BE 
SAILING INTO THE TEES ESTUARY 
THE SIGHT OF FOUR RUSTING AMERICAN WARSHIPS IS ABSOLUTELY STARTLING 
WITH THE IMAGE OF THIS AREA'S TRIUMPHANT SHIPBUILDING PAST STILL CLEAR IN MY MIND 
IT'S SOBERING TO BE CONFRONTED BY SHIPS AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE 
THESE FOUR ARE JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG 
FOUR THOUSAND MILES AWAY ON THE JAMES RIVER IN VIRGINIA 
THERE ARE MORE THAN SIXTY IN THE COLD WAR GHOST FLEET 
JUST RUSTING AWAY 
THE GHOST SHIPS WERE TOWED INTO HARTLEPOOL ON A TIDE OF PROTEST 
THERE WERE AND STILL ARE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE IMPACT OF BREAKING SHIPS ON THIS PART OF THE COAST 
ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNERS NEED ONLY POINT TO SHIP BREAKING OPERATIONS 
IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD TO SHOW HOW DISASTROUS THEY CAN BE 
GLOBALLY SIX HUNDRED SHIPS ARE BROKEN EVERY YEAR 
NINETY PER CENT OF THEM IN BANGLADESH CHINA PAKISTAN INDIA AND TURKEY 
AND OFTEN WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION FOR THE ENVIRONMENT 
OR TO WORKERS DOING THE BREAKING 
BY TWO THOUSAND TEN IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THE NUMBER OF SHIPS 
NEEDING TO BE SCRAPPED EVERY YEAR WILL RISE TO THREE THOUSAND 
MANY PEOPLE ME INCLUDED BELIEVE THAT BREAKING SHIPS IN DOCKS LIKE HARTLEPOOL 
WAS A MUCH BETTER OPTION 
THAN DUMPING OUR RUSTING FLEETS ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S BEACHES 
IN JULY TWO THOUSAND THREE ABLE U. K. WON THE CONTRACT TO DECOMMISSION THIRTEEN OF THE AMERICAN GHOST FLEET 
AND THE FIRST FOUR ARRIVED IN HARTLEPOOL FOUR MONTHS LATER 
BUT WORK ON THEM NEVER BEGAN 
MIRED IN LEGAL WRANGLINGS 
THEIR FATE NOW RESTS ON AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
WHAT A MESS 
TO THINK THAT THIS RUST BUCKET WAS ONCE PART OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S ELITE NAVIES 
EVEN THOUGH I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THESE SHIPS 
NOTHING HAS PREPARED ME FOR WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE ABOARD THESE ROTTING HULKS 
ABLE U. K. WON THE CONTRACT FROM THE U. S. MARINE ADMINISTRATION 
BY PROPOSING A METHOD OF DISMANTLING AND RECYCLING THE SHIPS 
IN A SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED DRY DOCK 
ONCE YOU GOT THEM HERE 
WHY DO YOU THINK VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS DISAGREED 
WE DON'T HONESTLY KNOW 
PEOPLE SAY IT'S TERRIBLE WHAT GREENPEACE ARE DOING TO YOU PETER 
AND THEY'RE NOT GREENPEACE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE 
WHAT PROVIDING THE TYPE OF FACILITY AND THE TYPE OF SHIP BREAKING METHODS 
THAT GREENPEACE WANT TO SEE UNDERTAKEN 
FRIENDS OF THE EARTH IS THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS BEEN OPPOSED TO THIS 
FRIENDS OF THE EARTH MAINTAIN THAT THESE SHIPS 
AND THE OTHER NINE THAT ABLE U. K. ARE CONTRACTED TO DISMANTLE HERE 
ARE TOXIC 
THEY SHOULDN'T BE CALLED TOXIC SHIPS 
IT'S A MISUSE OF THE TERMINOLOGY REGARDING THESE SHIPS 
THERE IS POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS WASTE ON THESE SHIPS 
THIS INSULATION COULD CONTAIN ASBESTOS 
WE TAKE TESTS AND IF THERE'S ASBESTOS FOUND 
THEN WE TREAT THIS AREA AS ASBESTOS 
HAVE YOU USED THIS TECHNIQUE BEFORE REMOVE ASBESTOS FROM A CONFINED AREA 
YEAH I'VE BEEN DOING ASBESTOS FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS 
BUT FRIENDS OF THE EARTH ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT A GROUP OF CHEMICALS CALLED P. C. B.'S 
NOW BANNED THEY'RE KNOWN TO BE CARCINOGENIC 
A LOT OF THE CABLE THAT'S BEEN USED THAT'S CAUSED CONCERN WITH P. C. B.'S 
IS THIS CABLE OVER HERE 
SEE THE LARGER CABLE 
PEOPLE CALCULATE THE TOTAL WEIGHT OF ALL THESE CABLES SAY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TONNE 
AND THEY'VE SAID THERE'S ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TONNE OF P. C. B.'S ON THIS SHIP 
THAT'S TOTALLY WRONG 
P. C. B.'S WERE USED AS AN INSULATOR IN POWER CABLES 
BUT ONLY MAKE UP A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEIR TOTAL WEIGHT 
THESE SHIPS DO HOWEVER CONTAIN HUGE QUANTITIES OF OLD ENGINE OIL 
A SERIOUS AND WELL UNDERSTOOD THREAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT 
THIS IS A TYPICAL TYPE OF MACHINERY AND MOTORS THAT HAS OIL IN THEM 
THERE'S ENGINE OIL IN THEM 
THAT OIL'S REMOVED BEFORE WE DO THE DECOMMISSIONING IN THE DRY DOCK 
IF THERE WAS A SPILLAGE IT'S IN A CONTAINED AREA WE JUST MOP IT UP 
PETER CONFIDENTLY TALKS ABOUT DISMANTLING THESE SHIPS IN THE DRY DOCK 
BUT EVEN THAT'S CONTROVERSIAL 
THE DRY DOCK HASN'T BEEN BUILT YET 
IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE PLANNING PERMISSION 
THE SITUATION IS COMPLICATED BY THE LOCATION 
THE GHOST SHIPS AND THE DRY DOCKS THAT ABLE U. K. WANT TO BUILD 
ARE RIGHT NEXT TO THE SEAL SANDS SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST 
IT IS AN AMAZING JEWEL IN THE CROWN 
IT IS SURROUNDED BY INDUSTRY THAT HAS CLEANED UP A LOT OVER THE PAST TEN TO TWELVE YEARS 
THE RIVER TEES IS NOW CLEANER THAN IT HAS BEEN FOR DECADES 
IT'S AN IMPORTANT SITE FOR FEEDING BIRDS 
ESPECIALLY AT WINTER TIME 
VERY LARGE POPULATIONS OF KNOT AND PLOVER AND REDSHANKS 
IT'S IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE INVERTEBRATES WITHIN THE MUD 
AND OF COURSE IT'S FAMOUS FOR THE SEALS 
WHAT WOULD THE EFFECT BE ON THIS ESTUARY OF SHIP BREAKING 
THERE WOULD BE A NUMBER OF EFFECTS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS THE COMPANY WANTS TO DREDGE THE RIVER 
TO BRING IN BIG SHIPS FOR SCRAPPING 
THAT DREDGING COULD COMPLETELY DESTROY THE WILDLIFE SITE 
IF YOU DREDGE THE RIVER THE MUDFLATS CAN COLLAPSE 
THE MUD WILL SLIP INTO THE RIVER BE DREDGED OUT 
AND THERE WOULD BE NO FEEDING GROUND FOR THE BIRDS 
SENDING THEIR NAVAL SHIPS TO BE BROKEN IN THE U. K. 
WEREN'T THE BRITISH AND AMERICANS TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING 
WELL THEY WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING BY NOT SENDING THEM TO THE DEVELOPING WORLD TO GET TRASHED 
BUT DOING THE PROPER RIGHT THING WOULD BE FOR AMERICA TO DEAL WITH THEM IN THEIR OWN SHIPYARDS 
THE ONLY THING THAT FRIENDS OF THE EARTH AND ABLE AGREE ON IS THESE SHIPS SHOULD BE BROKEN UP SAFELY 
UNDER STRICT ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS 
AFTER TWO YEARS OF FIGHTING POSITIONS HAVE BECOME ENTRENCHED 
ABLE U. K. ARE VERY CLEAR WHERE THEY STAND 
IF WE DON'T GET PERMISSION TO DO THEM HERE WHICH WOULD BE A SHAME FOR THE AREA 
COS THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR JOBS FOR THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS BUT IF WE DIDN'T GET THEM HERE 
THEN WE WOULD DO THE SAME TECHNIQUES IN ANOTHER DRY DOCK SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD 
IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S NO PERFECT SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM 
SHIPS IN EVER INCREASING NUMBERS WILL HAVE TO BE BROKEN UP 
WHICHEVER WAY THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT GOES SOME WILL LOSE OUT 
BUT AS IN THE DECISION TO STOP SHIPBUILDING HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
IT'S THE COAST THAT WILL FEEL THE IMPACT FOR GENERATIONS AFTER THE DECISION IS MADE 
WHILE MUCH OF THIS COAST IS STRUGGLING TO COME TO TERMS WITH ITS INDUSTRIAL LEGACY 
JUST SEVEN MILES FROM HARTLEPOOL 
THE BEACH AT REDCAR IS ALIVE WITH ACTIVITY 
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S AS FAR AS I CAN IMAGINE FROM MAUI BONDAI OR EVEN NEWQUAY 
IT'S BECOMING A MECCA FOR A NEW SPORT THAT'S SWEEPING THE COAST 
I'M A KITE SURFER 
TWENTY TWO SOUTH WESTERLY PERFECT 
IT'S THE FASTEST GROWING WATERSPORT SINCE IT STARTED IN FRANCE THEN CAME TO THE U. K. 
REDCAR'S A REALLY GOOD SPOT TO KITE SURF COS IT'S GOT BIG WIDE EMPTY BEACHES NO GROYNES 
IT'S PRETTY WINDY MOST OF THE TIME WE'RE IN SUMMER HERE AND WE'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE M. P. H. WINDS 
WHICH IS QUITE UNUSUAL 
THE WATER IS GETTING GOOD IT USED TO BE POLLUTED FROM THE RIVER TEES 
BUT IT'S IMPROVING ALL THE TIME 
WE'RE GETTING PORPOISES AND FISH JUMPING AROUND NOW WHICH IS GOOD TO SEE 
YOU CAN GET SPEEDS UP TO FORTY M. P. H. 
JUMPS UP TO FIFTY TO SIXTY F. T. 
IT CAN BE QUITE SCARY BUT YOU HANG THERE FOR QUITE A LONG TIME 
SO YOU'VE GOT TIME TO PLAN YOUR LANDING 
BUT IT'S JUST BEING OUT ON THE SEA YOU DON'T NEED A MOTOR BOAT OR ANYTHING TO PULL YOU ALONG 
YOU'RE JUST USING THE POWER OF THE WIND NO POLLUTION INVOLVED 
THERE'S A BIG FRATERNITY NOW OF SURFERS AND KITERS UP HERE AND IT'S GROWING 
IT'S AN OASIS AMONG INDUSTRIAL TEESSIDE 
IN THE LAST FEW MILES OF THIS JOURNEY THE COAST CHANGES AGAIN 
LEAVING THE HEAVY INDUSTRY BEHIND AND MOVING BACK TO NATURE 
FROM SALTBURN BY THE SEA ALMOST THROUGH TO THE END OF THIS LEG 
SPECTACULAR JURASSIC CLIFFS MARK WHERE THE NORTH YORKSHIRE MOORS MEET THE SEA 
AND IT'S AT WHITBY WHERE THIS LEG OF MY JOURNEY ENDS 
THESE WHALE JAW BONES RECALL THE FACT WHITBY WAS ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST IMPORTANT WHALING PORTS 
TODAY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT MANY MIGHT WANT TO CELEBRATE 
AS I TRAVEL THESE LAST ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILES DOWN THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND 
WHAT STRUCK ME EVEN ABOVE THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF THIS COAST 
IS HOW MANY REALLY SIGNIFICANT EVENTS HAVE HAPPENED HERE 
AND STRANGELY HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE FADED FROM OUR COLLECTIVE MEMORY 
THE WARS THAT SHAPED THE UNITED KINGDOM 
AND THE VIOLENT RIOTS THAT CHANGED IT 
THE FIRST EVER HUMAN SETTLEMENT ON OUR SHORES 
AND EVEN THE WORLD BEATING INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE 
SEEM LARGELY FORGOTTEN OUTSIDE THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY 
PERHAPS THE REASON IS THAT BRITAIN STARTED TO LOOK IN THE OTHER DIRECTION 
AS OUR HORIZONS BROADENED BEYOND EUROPE TOWARDS AMERICA 
IT WAS THE WEST COAST THAT WAS BEST PLACED TO OPEN UP THE NEW WORLD 
BUT DON'T DISMISS THE EAST COAST YET 
THE NEXT LEG OF THIS JOURNEY TAKES US FROM ROBIN HOOD'S BAY TO THE WASH 
A COAST OF INNOVATION 
IT'S THE HOME OF BRITAIN'S OLDEST SEA GOING BOATS 
AND ONE OF THE NATION'S FAVOURITE COMFORT FOODS 
IT'S THE BIRTHPLACE OF OUR CHEMICAL INDUSTRY 
IT'S ALSO WHERE THE BRITISH SEASIDE HOLIDAY WAS INVENTED 
I'VE HAD MY EYES OPENED WIDE BY THE NORTH EAST COAST OF ENGLAND 
ONCE VISITED NEVER FORGOTTEN AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT 
THESE CHIPS ARE THE BEST I'VE TASTED ON THE ENTIRE JOURNEY
