PROGRESS OF THE OLYMPIC TORCH ON 
ITS THIRTY ONE MILE JOURNEY ACROSS LONDON 
TO GREENWICH THERE HAVE BEEN 
REPEATED CLASHES BETWEEN POLICE AND 
HUMAN RIGHTS PROTESTERS DEMANDING 
A BOYCOTT OF THE BEIJING GAMES 
MORE THAN THIRTY OF THEM HAVE BEEN 
ARRESTED THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS 
OF SPECTATORS TURNING OUT TO WATCH 
THE PROCESSION WHICH BEGAN WITH 
SIR STEVE REDGRAVE AT WEMBLEY 
STADIUM BRIAN HANRAHAN REPORTS ON 
THE DAY'S EVENTS 
AN EMPTY WEMBLEY STADIUM WHERE A 
SMALL GROUP OF OFFICIALS WATCHED 
THE FLAME HANDED TO SIR STEVE

SETTING OF THREE LONDON'S STREETS 
A SERIES OF DEMONSTRATORS TRIED TO 
DISRUPT THE RELAY ONE USED FIRE 
EXTINGUISHER ANOTHER TRIED TO

PETER PRESENTER KONNIE HUQ 
AS I 
SPEAK SOMEBODY HAS TRIED TO GRAB 
THE TORCH FROM KONNIE HUQ A MAN 
HAS TRIED TO GRAB THE TORCH HE HAS 
BEEN HAULED TO THE GROUND BY POLICE 
OFFICERS HE HAD HIS HANDS ON THE 
TORCH 
WITH TWO WINGS OF PROTECTION TORCH CHINESE OFFICIALS INSIDE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE OUTSIDE THE 
TORCH BATTLED THROUGH TWO RINGS 
BUT HUNDREDS OF DEMONSTRATORS WERE 
WAKING WAITING 
WE CAN ARGUE 
ABOUT THE SPORTING ISSUE BUT THIS 
IS MORAL WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
TORTURE AND A LACK OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN 
POLITICS AND SPORT 
THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR TOOK THE 
TORCH THROUGH CHINATOWN IT WAS NOT 
WHAT WAS PLANNED BUT THE DAY WAS 
NOT GOING THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED 
IT WAS A TOUR OF LONDON'S LANDMARKS 
IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE THE TORCH TOOK 
THE PLINTH AND PROTESTERS THE 
FOUNTAINS IT WAS THE 
DEMONSTRATORS' NOT CHINA CHINA'S 
THAT WAS BEING BEAMED OUT ALONG 
WHITEHALL PRO AND ANTI CHINESE 
DEMONSTRATORS CAME FACE TO FACE 
CHINESE STUDENTS HAD BEEN ORGANISED 
BY SUPPORTERS OF THE GAMES 
WE ARE 
CHINESE AND WE ARE PROUD OF OUR 
COUNTRY HOSTING THE OLYMPICS IN 
BEIJING 
IT IS CHLORITE HOUR BEIJING RIGHT TO BE PROUD OF MY OWN COUNTRY 
THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS 
BUT AS 
THE TORCH APPROACHED DOWNING STREET 
THERE WERE REPEATED SCUFFLES 
BETWEEN POLICE AND DEMONSTRATORS 
THE TORCH ITSELF WAS ALL BUT 
INVISIBLE AS HUNDREDS CHEERED ITS 
PASSAGE THE POINT OPERATING IT IN 
PUBLIC WAS LOST CHIRWA INSIDE 
THE SECURITY CORDON AT DOWNING 
STREET GORDON BROWN WAS ON HAND TO 
WATCH THE TORCH BEING TRANSFERRED 
BUT ALTHOUGH HE SHOOK HANDS WITH 
EVERYONE HE DID NOT TOUCH THE 
TORCH ITSELF THE OLYMPICS MINISTER 
SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT 
MISTAKE NOT TO GO AHEAD WITH THE 
RELAY 
THE WELCOME OF THE OLYMPIC RELAY TORCH TO LONDON IS NOT THE SAME AS 
CONDONING HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME IN 
CHINA OR CONDONING THE TREATMENT 
OF TIBET 
PAULA RADCLIFFE THE 
MARATHON RUNNER TOOK THE TORCH OUT 
TO THE EAST OF LONDON TO THE SITES 
WHERE THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS WILL BE 
HELD BY NOW PROTECTION FOR THE 
TORCH HAD BEEN STEPPED UP BUT MANY 
OF THOSE WHO CARRIED THE TORCH SAID 
THEY HAD SYMPATHY WITH PROTESTERS 
AND SAW THE DAY AS AN OBJECT LESSON 
IN DEMOCRATIC PROTEST WANT CHINA 
MIGHT LEARN FROM 
IT IS OUR NATURE 
OF BEING VERY OPEN IN THIS COUNTRY 
THAT PROTESTERS CAN MAKE THEIR 
POINT AS AN ATHLETE I'M PLEASED 
THAT IS HAPPENING 
YACHTSWOMEN DAME 
ELLEN MACARTHUR CARRIED THE TORCH 
DOWN REFER TO THE O. TWO DOME WHERE 
MANY PROMINENT SUPPORTERS OF THE 
OLYMPICS WERE WAITING AMONG THEM 
PRINCE HASSAN AND LONDON MAYOR KEN 
LIVINGSTONE FOR MANY INVOLVED THE 
DILEMMA COULD BE ANSWERED WITH ONE 
QUESTION PRINCESS ANNE WHO 
WOULD BENEFIT MOST FROM THE 
PUBLICITY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
OR THOSE WHO OPPOSE IT 
WELL IMAGES OF THE RELAY AND 
INDEED THE PROTESTS HAVE BEEN 
SHOWN ACROSS THE WORLD BUT IN 
CHINA A VERY DIFFERENT STORY 
WHERE THE COVERAGE IS STRICTLY 
CONTROLLED CONTROLLED EVERY NIGHT FROM ON HIGH THE 
COMMUNIST PARTY DELIVERS THE NEWS 
TONIGHT'S MOST IMPORTANT STORY IS 
THE STATE OF THE MODERN TRACTOR AND 
THE PROGRESS OF SOCIALISM IN THE 
COUNTRYSIDE A FEW MINUTES LATER 
THERE WAS BRIEF MENTION OF THE 
TORCH RELAY IN LONDON AND HOW WELL 
IT HAS GONE HE WILL NOT GET TO SEE 
ANY PICTURES OF THE DISRUPTION TO 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY IF YOU 
WATCH THIS CHANNEL THE CHINESE 
COMMUNIST PARTY HAS A SIMPLE RULE 
IT WILL NOT SHOW ANY PICTURES WHICH 
RUN IN THIS COUNTRY'S IDEA OF A 
TROUBLE FREE GAMES WHICH RUN IN 
SO WE ASK DOES ANYONE HERE AT 
KNOW ABOUT THE SCUFFLES IN LONDON 
WHICH RUIN 
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING THIS MAN 
SAYS I HAVE READ THAT EVERYONE 
SUPPORTS THE OLYMPICS THIS HIS 
WIFE ADDS HER HUSBAND AGREES 
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING SAYS THIS 
MAN IS IT SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE 
DALAI LAMA SPORT AND POLITICS 
SHOULD BE KEPT SEPARATE 
CHINA INSISTS ON KEEPING BAD NEWS 
AWAY FROM ITS CITIZENS IT IS THE 
KIND OF OSTRICH STRATEGY PEOPLE 
MAY BE LOOKING UP BUT TONIGHT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS MADE SURE THEIR 
HEADS ARE BURIED IN THE SAND 
LET'S BRING IN OUR SPORTS EDITOR 
MIHIR BOSE WE WERE EXPECTING 
PROTESTS PERHAPS NOT ON THIS SCALE 
HAVE YOU THINK THE AUTHORITIES 
HANDLED THEM 
I HAD BEEN TALKING TO 
GOVERNMENT MINISTERS IN RETROSPECT 
HAD THEY KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING TO 
HAPPEN THEY WOULD HAVE WANTED A 
MUCH SHORTER RELAY REMEMBER IT 
WAS THIRTY ONE MILES WHICH MEANT THOSE 
IMAGES YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
HAVE BEEN OCCURRING FOR THE WHOLE 
DAY BUT THEY DO TAKE COMFORT FROM 
THE FACT THAT WHILE THEY HAVE BEEN 
PROTESTS THE TALK REALLY HAS GONE 
ON AND 
HAVE BEEN ALLOWED 
WHICH REFLECTS ON OUR DEMOCRACY IN 
CONTRAST TO OTHER COUNTRIES 
PARTICULARLY CHINA 
WHAT HAS THAT 
DONE TO THE OLYMPIC BRAND AND THE 
LONDON BRAND GOOD OR BAD 
IT HAS 
CERTAINLY DAMAGED BEAT OLYMPIC 
BRAND THEY WANTED A TORCH RELAY 
WATCHED BY SPECTATORS ON EITHER 
SIDE WE HAVE HAD A VERY CAGED 
TORCH RELAY YOU COULD HARDLY SEE 
THE PERSON HOLDING THE TORCH 
SURROUNDED BY POLICE AND SECURITY 
IT WILL NOT HAVE ENHANCED THE IMAGE 
IS BEIJING WANTED TO PROJECT OF THE 
TORCH IT WOULD NOT HAVE ENHANCED 
LONDON'S IMAGES BECAUSE LONDON IS 
THE NEXT CITY AFTER BEIJING FOR THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES 
ORGANISERS WERE 
CALLING TODAY'S REALLY A JOURNEY OF 
HOPE AND HARMONY TOMORROW'S 
HEADLINES MAY BE SPEAKING MORE 
ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS 
AND NOW THE REST OF THE NEWS THERE 
HAS BEEN HEAVY SNOW IN MANY PARTS 
OF BRITAIN SOME AREAS HAVE SEEN UP 
TO THREE INCHES CAUSING WIDESPREAD 
TRAVEL PROBLEMS ROADS WERE BADLY 
AFFECTED BUT THE BIGGEST DISRUPTION 
IS AT AIRPORTS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FLIGHTS HAD 
BEEN CANCELLED AT HEATHROW JOE 
LYNAM IS THERE IT LOOKED FAIRLY 
CLEAR WHERE YOU ARE AT THE MOMENT 
BUT WHAT HAS TODAY BEEN LIKE FOR 
PASSENGERS IT LOOKS 
YES A 
LOVELY EVENING RIGHT NOW BUT 
WINTERY BLIZZARDS EARLIER THAT LED 
TO ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR FLIGHTS BEING CANCELLED OUT 
OF HEATHROW THROUGHOUT THE CAMPUS 
BEHIND ME WE HAVE SPOKEN TO 
PASSENGERS WHO SAID THEY HAD TO 
WAIT HOURS ON THEIR PLANE WHILE IT 
WAS DEFROSTED AND HAD THE SNOW 
REMOVED BY THE ICING MACHINES 
CONFUSION CONTINUES TO REIGN AT 
HEATHROW ONE WOMAN TOLD ME SHE HAD 
SEEN SCUFFLES BREAKING OUT BETWEEN 
PASSENGERS AND B. A. STAFF AS THEY 
TRIED TO GET ON OR OFF BUSES 
BRITISH AIRWAYS ARE MOVING HEAVEN 
ON A HEAVEN AND EARTH TO GET 
THINGS BACK ON SCHEDULE BUT FLIGHT 
WILL PUSH INTO TOMORROW SO MORE 
FLIGHT WILL BE CANCELLED IT IS NOT 
JUST HEATHROW GATWICK AIRPORT SAW 
FORTY FOUR FLIGHTS CHECK THE B. A. WEBSITE 
IS THE MESSAGE FROM THE AIRLINE 
TWO PRESIDENT'S WITH LITTLE TIME 
LEFT IN OFFICE HAD A FINE NOT 
SUMMIT TODAY GEORGE BUSH AND 
VLADIMIR PUTIN HAD BEEN MEETING ON 
THE BLACK SEA THEY PARTED AS 
DIVIDED ON THE MAJOR ISSUES AS 
BEFORE AMERICAN MISSILE DEFENCE 
PLANS AND NATO ENLARGEMENT REMAIN 
CONTROVERSIAL BUT THE TWO MEN SAY 
THEIR PERSONAL BOND HAS MADE BETTER 
RELATIONS FOR THEIR NATIONS 
THIS IS THE PICTURE GEORGE BUSH 
AND VLADIMIR PUTIN WOULD LIKE TO 
REMEMBER OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP TWO 
OLD FRIENDS WALKING ON THE SEASHORE 
IN THE TWILIGHT OF THEIR 
PRESIDENCIES TODAY AS THEY MET 
FOR THE LAST TIME GEORGE BUSH 
SOUGHT TO CLAIM THAT HIS FRIENDSHIP 
WITH THE VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS 
SUCCEEDED IN BURYING THE COLD WAR 
FOR EVER 
A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS 
COULD WE WORKED TOGETHER TO PUT THE 
COLD WAR IN THE PAST COULD WE 
WORKED I FULLY RECOGNISE THERE ARE 
PEOPLE IN AMERICA AND RUSSIA AND 
THINK IT STILL EXISTS IT IS 
IMPORTANT FOR READERS TO THINK 
STRATEGICALLY AND NOT GET STUCK IN 
THE PAST FOUR LEADERS 
THAT IS 
NOT HOW RUSSIA SEES THINGS THIS IS 
THE SIZE OF NATO IN NINETEEN NINETY AND THIS 
IS HOW IT HAS GROWN SINCE NOW 
GEORGE AND UKRAINE ARE LINING UP TO 
JOIN ADD IN U. S. PLANS FOR HIM A 
NEW ANTI MISSILE SYSTEM IN THE 
CZECH REPUBLIC AND POLAND AND TO 
RUSSIA IT LOOKS LIKE ENCIRCLEMENT 
STOCK I WILL NOT 
CONCEAL THAT ONE OF THE MOST 
DIFFICULT ISSUES WAS AND REMAINS 
THE ISSUE OF MISSILE DEFENCE IN 
EUROPE EUROPE THIS IS NOT ABOUT LANGUAGE OR 
DIPLOMATIC PHRASING OR WORDING 
THIS IS ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE 
ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO BE VERY 
CLEAR ON THIS OUR FUNDAMENTAL 
ATTITUDE TO THE AMERICAN PLANS HAS 
NOT CHANGED 
ACROSS THE BORDER IN UKRAINE AND 
GEORGIA IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT 
HERE NATO MEMBERSHIP IS SEEN AS 
INSURANCE AGAINST A NEWLY RESURGENT 
RUSSIA WHICH STILL HAS THOUSANDS 
OF NUCLEAR WARHEADS TANKS AND 
DOZENS OF STRATEGIC BOMBERS THE 
MAY BE OVER BUT THE DEEP 
DISTRUST WHICH ONCE CUT EUROPE IN 
TWO STILL PERSISTS PRESIDENT BUSH 
CAME HERE TO SOCHI TO TRY AND 
PERSUADE HIS OLD FRIEND VLADIMIR 
PUTIN THAT NATO EXPANSION AND 
MISSILE DEFENCE ARE NO THREAT TO 
RUSSIA IN THAT HE APPEARS TO HAVE 
FAILED RUSSIA'S POLITICAL AND 
MILITARY ELITE SEE THE WHOLE 
STRATEGIC MAP OF EUROPE BEING 
REDRAWN IN FAVOUR OF AMERICA 
DESPITE THE PROTESTATIONS OF 
FRIENDSHIP BY PRESIDENT BUSH THEY 
SIMPLY DON'T BELIEVE AMERICA'S 
PLANS ARE NOT DIRECTED AT RUSSIA 
THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH HAS BEEN 
DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL AFTER 
THREE DAYS OF TREATMENT FOR A CHEST 
INFECTION PRINCE PHILIP EIGHTY SIX WILL 
RECUPERATE AT WINDSOR CASTLE 
BUCKINGHAM PALACE HAVE SAID ALL HIS 
ENGAGEMENTS FOR TOMORROW AND IT 
WILL THEN BE DECIDED ON A DAY TO 
DAY BASIS 
THE OSCAR WINNING STAR OF SOME OF 
HOLLYWOOD'S GREATEST EPICS 
CHARLTON HESTON HAS DIED AT THE 
AGE OF EIGHTY FOUR HIS DEATH AT HOME IN 
BEVERLY HILLS CAME SIX YEARS AFTER

SEEM TO HAVE THE TWENTIETH CENTURY FACE 
HIS SOCCEROOS VOICE HAD SOMETHING 
TO DO WITH IT TOO HERE IN 
SHAKESPEARE'S JULIUS CAESAR SO 
ONEROUS 
CRY HAVOC AND LET ONEROUS ONEROUS THE DOGS OF WAR 
BY NINETEEN SIXTY ONE HE WAS AT 
THE PEAK OF HIS CAREER IN EL CID 
OPPOSITE SOPHIA LOREN 
BUT THIS 
LOVE WILL NOT DIE 
KILL IT YOU YOU KILL IT TELL ME YOU DON'T LOVE ME

SUCCESS STRING OF SCI FI FILMS 
AND DISASTER MOVIES FOLLOWING HE 
BECAME ACTIVE IN RIGHT WING 
POLITICS SHARING THE PLATFORM WITH 
FELLOW ACTOR RONALD REAGAN AS HE
