DOCTOR SARAH JARVIS HAS 
LOOKED AT WIND AND ITCHYNESS THIS 
WEEK TODAY IT IS NAT FEET THEY 
ARE FLAT AREN'T THEY WIND 
ITCHYNESS FLAT FEET DO YOU SUFFER 
FROM ANY CONDITION 
I HAVE A HIGH 
INSTEP WHICH WE WILL DISCUSS LATER 
BUT I DON'T SUFFER FROM ANY OF 
THOSE 
IT WILL BE A BIG THRILL TO THOSE LOOK AT OUR INSTEP ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
DOCTORS SAID SUN BATHING WAS 
HEALTHY AND THEY ARE PUETY TODAY 
IN SUN AWARENESS WEEK SKIN CANCER 
IS THE FASTEST GROWING CANCER IN 
THE U. K. WE TRACE IT BACK TO THE 
EARLY BRONZING AGE THROUGHOUT 
HISTORY THE HUMAN RACE HAS HAD A 
SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SUN 
AND OF COURSE MANY LIKE TO BATH IN 
THE WARMTH WHENEVER WE WE CAN 
ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE TO 
USE SUN BLOCK FROM THE HARMFUL RAY 
IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY IT MIGHT 
SURPRISE YOU TO KNOW DOCTORS 
ADVOCATED SUN BATHING AS A 
THERAPEUTIC ACTIVITY THAT COULD 
SUCCESSFULLY CURE DISEASES IN NINETEEN OH THREE 
THIS DOCTOR OPENED THE FIRST 
DEDICATED SUN CLINIC IN THE SWISS 
ALPS HE WAS CONVINCED THE PURE AIR 
AND BRIGHT SUNLIGHT HAD HEALING 
PROPERTIES MANY SHARED THIS BELIEF 
JOHN HARVEY KEL LOG HAD EMPLOYED 
SUN BATHS UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION 
CLAIMING THEY WORKED WONDERS FOR 
GOUT RHEUMATISM AND SKIN 
CONDITIONS IN BRITAIN U. V. 
TREATMENT WAS THOUGHT TO WARD OFF 
THE COMMON COLD BEFORE THE TWENTIETH 
CENTURY YOUR SKIN TONE DEFINED WHO 
YOU WERE 
SO PALE ERSKINE BELONGED TO THE 
UPPER CLASSES DARK SKIN INDICATED 
A LIFETIME OF OUTDOOR LABOUR THEIR 
BETTERS COVERED THEIR BODIES HID 
BEHIND PAR SOLS AND WIDE BRIMED 
HATS BY THE MID NINETEEN TWENTY THIS HAD 
CHANGED THE GREAT OUTDOORS CALLED 
AND IF YOU WERE IN THE SUN YOU 
WERE GOING TO GET TANNED BUT THAT 
IS O. K. LEGEND GIVES THE CREDIT TO 
THIS TO COCO CHANEL SHE ZEPTALLY 
GOT TANNED OVERNIGHT AND SHE 
STARTED A CRAZE THE SUNTAN HAD 
ARRIVED AS THE SYMBOL OF WEALTH 
AND LEISURE A TAN IN THE WINTER 
EVEN SUGGESTED THE BEARER HAD 
ENOUGH MONEY AND STATUS TO AFFORD A 
VACATION TO AN EXOTIC WARM CLIMATE 
SIMPLE SLOT MACHINE TAKES A DISC 
THAT CAN BE BOUGHT IN LOBBY IT 
GIVES TWENTY MINUTES OF SUNLIGHT YOU YOU DON'T REQUIRE THE SUN TO GET THAT 
EXOTIC LOOK OVER THE YEARS INDOOR 
TANNING BUSINESS HAS TAKEN A FIRM 
HOLD OF PROCEEDINGS AND IS NOW A 
MULTI POUND DERRY EVEN SO IT IS 
NO BETTER FOR US THAN THE SUN JUST 
MORE CONVENIENT IF WE ARE 
CONCERNED WITH OUR LONG TERM HEALTH 
AS A NATION PERHAPS ALL WE CAN 
HOPE FOR IS A CHANGE IN VOGUE ONE 
THAT WILL FINALLY MAKE BAKING IN 
THE SUN A FASHION FOU PA WE CAN 
LIVE WITHOUT THERE'S A MESSAGE 
ABOUT SUNBEDS BEING DANGEROUS NOT 
GETTING OUT 
I WISH IT WERE 
ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
IMTHRILLED THE GOVERNMENT IS 
BANNING THEM FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
BECAUSE SUNTANING AND ESPECIALLY 
SUNBURNING YOU HEAR PEOPLE HAVE I 
DON'T THINK I HAVE A PROPER TAN 
UNTIL I BURN AND MELANOMA OCCURS 
FOR TEN PER CENT OF SKIN CANCER AND NINETY PER CENT OF 
DEATHS IS DUE TO BURNING SUNBED SUNBED CAN HELP YOU DO YOU NOT THINK I I USED TO I ADMIT I USED SUNBEDS IN 
MY TEEN YEARS I STOPPED AFTER A 
WHILE I BECAME AWARE OF THE FACT 
IT AGES YOU AND THE DANGERS OF IT 
AND MY GRANDMOTHER WAS DIAGNOSED 
WITH SKIN CANCER I BECAME A FEW 
YEARS AGO 
YOU Z. YOU GET LASTING 
DAMAGE 
MOST PEOPLE HAVE DAMAGE PIGMENTATION WHICH SO MANY WOMEN 
IN THEIR THIRTIES DO THAT THAT'S MORE 
MOPBL IMBALANCES 
IF YOU ARE 
ACKNOWLEDGE N. E. ANY AND THINK IT'S 
BETTER THAT'S FINE NOW BUT WHAT 
ABOUT TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW 
I HAVE A 
TEENAGER FROM TREDEGAR WHO HAD 
ACNE AND ENDED UP ON THE SUNBED 
AND ENDED UP LIKE THIS 
THAT'S IT 
BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY WHEN YOU'RE 
A CHILD YOU ARE OFTEN SETTING UP 
FOR PROBLEMS LATER ON IN LIFE HE 
WILL HAVE TO BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL 
MELANOMA MOLES AS WELL L. AM 
CONSCIENCE OF CHECKING THINGS WHAT 
SHOULD WE LOOK OUT FOR THINKING THINKING NAES DIFFERENT MELANOMA IS A FORM 
OF MOLE BUT CANCEROUS FORM AND 
PARTICULARLY NASTY ONE ANYTHING 
THAT CHANGES IF IT HAS IRREGULAR 
SURFACE GROWN IRREGULAR EDGES 
AND THE COLOUR HAS CHANGED OR IF 
YOU GET SATELLITES AROUND THE EDGES 
MINI ONCE OR IF IT BLEEDS OR 
INCHES 
WHAT IF IT IS A NEW ONE INCHES FRANKLY I WOULD RATHER SEE 
HUNDRED MOLES UNNECESSARILY RATHER 
THAN NOT 
I HAVE BEEN CHECKED I 
WENT TO THE MOLE CLINIC AND HAD 
MOLES CHECKED IT IS WORTH GOING 
ONCE A YEAR IT IS NOT THAT 
EXPENSIVE TO GET THEM CHECKED L. 
CAN RELAX AND THINK AT THE MOMENT 
I'M O. K. 
YOU ARE NOT A MOLEY KIND OF 
PERSON 
I HAVE A FEW HIDDEN ONE PERSON ONES THEY CHECK EVERYTHING IT IS 
NOT EMBARRASSING AT ALL SOME WOMEN 
WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT UP BECAUSE YOU 
ARE IN YOUR UNDERWEAR 
WHAT ABOUT THE TANNING THING WITH 
CELEBRITY AND DAZ 
DAZ LIQUID TABS 
WANT TO FOCUS ABOUT HIDDEN DIRT 
AND GOSSIP MAGAZINES T. GOES BACK TO 
THE SUNBED ISSUE AND PEOPLE WANTING 
TO LOOK GOOD ALL YOUNG WOMEN LOOK 
AT VICTORIA BECKHAM WHO IS ALWAYS 
TANDED 
MOST OF THEM IS FAKE TAN TANDED THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH FAKE 
TAN APART FROM THE STREAKS 
DO YOU 
LIKE BEING GOSSIPED ABOUT THE 
OBSESSION WE HAVE ABOUT GOSSIPING 
YOU ABOUT YOU PERSONALLY 
SOME OF 
IT YOU TAKE WITH A PINCH OF SALT 
LIKE RELATIONSHIPS I'M READING I'M 
GETTING MARRIED OR RUN OFF TO GET 
ENGAGED BUT I READ GOSSIP 
MAGAZINES MYSELF AND I'M GUILTY 
AND PARTLY BECAUSE OF MY JOB I'M A 
T. V. PRESENTER AND DO A LIVE RADIO 
SHOW SO I HAVE TO READ THE 
NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES AS LONG 
AS IT IS INNOCENT AND NOTHING TOO 
DAMAGING IT FINE 
I HAVE REVEALED 
ONE OF MY SECRETS FOR THIS 
CAMPAIGN THAT I USED TO HAVE A 
CRUSH ON DES O'CONNOR 
WE ALL HAD 
AND HE HAS GREAT TAN AND YOUR 
MOLES MANY BIG NAME RETAILERS 
STOPPED ACCEPTING CHEQUES THE 
CHEQUE IS ABOUT TO BE BOUNCED INTO 
HISTORY CHEQUEBOOK HISTORY IN 
REMEMBRANCE DOM LITTLEWOOD PUT ON 
A DARK SUIT TO READ THE LAST RITES 
PEOPLE OF BRITAIN I SIT HERE 
BEFORE YOU TODAY WITH SADNESS AND 
HEAVY HEART 
IT IS MY DUTY TO INFORM YOU THAT 
THE CHEQUEBOOK IS DYING YOU 
REMEMBER THE CHEQUE IT WAS ONCE 
BEST MATES WITH THE RICH AND FAMOUS 
IT USED TO HANG OUT WITH 
POLITICIANS AND STARS MIGHTY HAVE 
LENNON OH BUT HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN UNLOVED AND UNWANTED ITS 
DAYS ARE NUMBERED BUT BEFORE WE 
LAY THE HUMBLE CHEQUE TO REST 
LET'S RELIVE ITS GLORY DAYS 
STHIEFPLT I'VE COME TO CAP KOOTS 
ONE OF BRITAIN'S OLDEST BANKS YOU 
ARE IN CHARGE OF THE AMAZING 
COLLECTION HERE ALSO OBVIOUSLY 
LOTS OF THINGS TO TELL LET'S START 
WITH THE CHEQUES 
THESE ARE CHARLES 
BY CHARLES DICKENS HE HAD AN 
ACCOUNT WITH THE BANK FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY SIX 
YOU HAD A VARIETY SOME MADE OUT TO 
COMPANIES IN INDIA HOUSEHOLD 
ACCOUNT AND HIS SIGNATURE YOU CAN 
SEE IN THIS BOOK 
IT LOOKS OLD 
ENOUGH TO BE IN A FILM LIKE SKAF 
THE EVIL SCAB DEAD 
THIS IS A 
SIGNATURE BOOK THIS IS FULL OF 
INTERESTING SIGNATURES ANOTHER WE 
HAVE HERE 
IT IS CHARLES DARWIN SIGNING AS A 
MEMBER OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY 
THEY WOULD SIGN SLIPS OF PAPER WHEN 
THEY OPEN THEIR ACCOUNTS THEY 
WOULD BE ADDED TO THE VOLUME T. 
WOULD ALLOW A CLERK TO COMPARE A 
SIGNATURE ON A BOOK AND CHEQUE AND 
PREVENT FRAUD FORGERY 
THE CONSENT 
HASN'T CHANGED JIEFPLT TRIED AND 
TESTED INSTRUMENT DESPITE THE OLD 
FASHIONED WAYS THE CHEQUE 
CONTINUED TO THRIVE AND BROKE INTO 
SHOWBIZ SHOWBIZ THEY EVER MIND IT IS THE TAKING 
PART THAT COUNTS YOU SHALL HAVE 
THE BLANKETY BLANK CHEQUEBOOK IT IT WAS MADE OF PAPER AND HAD TO BE HE 
IS SORTED AROUND THE WORLD BY AN 
ARMY OF BODYGUARDS AT ITS 
PEACEKEEP THERE WERE ELEVEN MILLION 
CHEQUES BEING WRITTEN EVERY DAY 
YOU LAY THEM END TO END THEY WOULD 
WRAP THE WORLD TWELVE TIMES THE DARK 
DAYS LAY AHEAD 
CHIN AND PIN WERE IN TOWN NO MORE 
SQUINTING AT SIGNATURES IT WAS 
MORE SECURE SHOPS LOVED ITS 
INSTANT RISK FREE STYLE AND THEY 
BEGAN TURNING THE CHEQUE AWAY 
THEY DON'T WANT THEM NOT 
INTERESTED INTERESTED EVEN M. AND AMP S. WON'T HAVE THEM GET YOUR 
MONEY OUT TAKE A CHEQUE AS IF NOT NOT WITH YOUR TRACK RECORD CASH POINTS 
DOWN THERE 
THE SHAME OF IT BANNED 
FROM MAJOR HIGH STREET STORES BIG BIG SHOPS ARE CUTTING DOWN ON THE 
NUMBER OF CHEQUES THEY ACCEPT T. 
TAKES THEM TIME TO LOOK AT THEM 
CHECK WHETHER THEY'RE GENUINE IT IT IS ALL ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE THROUGH 
THE TILLS QUICKER 
FOR SUPERMARKET 
THAT'S WHAT IT IS ABOUT THEY WANT 
TO ENSURE TILLS ARE OPEN CUSTOMERS 
ARE OUT AND SERVED AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE CHEQUES ARE A SLOW WAY OF 
DOING THAT 
ARE THEY GOING TO BE A 
THING OF THE PAST 
CERTAINLY THE 
CHEQUE ON THE HIGH STREET HAS DIED 
OUT CHEQUES WE USE TO PAY BILLS 
TO GIVE TO FRIENDS THAT'S NOT 
GOING TO CHANGE VERY SHORTLY 
AIFPLT IT'S CHECKERD CAREER SPANNED 
THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY YEARS BUT NOW IT IS HEADING 
FOR THE CLEARING HOUSE IN THE SKY 
WE WILL WRITE THEM ON THE BEACHES 
WE WOULD WRITE THEM ON THE FIELD 
WE WOULD WRITE THEM IN THE STREETS 
BUT THE TIME HAS COME TO SURRENDER 
TESCO PACKED IN TAKING CHEQUES NOW STREET BUT NOT 
THE CHEQUES WE WRITE TO FRIENDS 
AND CREDIT CARD BILLS WE STILL USE 
THEM PEOPLE COULD BE REEDUCATED 
AND DO THE THINGS ON LINE 
YOU CAN 
PARTICULARLY NOW MORE THAN TWENTY 
MILLION OF US BANK ON LINE AND 
TELEPHONE BANKING THAT'S WHY WE'RE 
INTRODUCING A NEW SERVICE THIS YEAR 
BUT IF YOU'RE INTERNET SAPHY YOU 
CAN DO THAT BUT MY PARENTS PAY FOR 
EVERYTHING WITH CHEQUE IT IS 
DIFFICULT THEN IF YOU CAN'T USE IT 
ANY MORE 
YOU DON'T SEE THE DEATH 
WHILST THERE'S NO ALTERNATIVE YOU 
HAVE TO ENSURE PEOPLE MAKE THE 
PAYMENTS THEY CAN MAKE YOU HAVE TO 
HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE BUT THE DEATH 
OF THE CHEQUE ON RETAILER LEVEL IS 
LED BY RETAILERS REALLY 
DO YOU 
CARRY CASH OR CHEQUES OR DO YOU 
HAVE PEOPLE TO DO THAT 
I'M SO OLD 
FASHIONED I STILL USE A 
HANDWRITTEN DIARY L. LOVE WRITING CHEQUES 
YOU CAN KEEP A TAB ON WHAT CHEQUES YOU'RE SPENDING 
WE'RE CULTURAL 
ATTACHED TO CHEQUES SO IT WILL BE 
DIFFICULT TO GET RID OF THEM 
COMPLETELY BUT THERE WILL BE 
ALTERNATIVES IN THE FUTURE WHAT WHAT ABOUT LOTTERY WINNERS THE 
PHOTOGRAPH WON'T BE THE SAME ANY 
MORE 
INTERESTING THING F. THE MONEY MORE GETS TO YOUR ACCOUNT QUICKER 
PERHAPS YOU WILL BE PLEASED BANKS BANKS HAVE CAUGHT UP AND YOU WILL BE 
ABLE TO DO INSTANT TRANSFERS IN IN THREE WEEK'S TIME WE WILL MAKE 
PHONE AND INTERNET BILLS TO 
TRANSFER BILLS AND MAKE BILLS TO 
FRIENDS 
ALL THIS WEEK DOCTOR SARAH FRIENDS HAS BEEN LOOKING AT YOUR 
EMBARRASSING COMPLAINTS ON MONDAY 
IT WAS WIND ON TUESDAY ITCHYNESS 
TODAY FLAT FEET IT IS A CONDITION 
WITH STIGMAS ATTACHED TO T. BUT 
WE'RE HAPPY TO PARADE THE PROBLEM 
IN FRONT OF OUR VERY EYES 
AS MANY AS ONE IN THREE OF US HAS 
FLAT FEET IT SOUNDS COMECAL AND 
YOU THINK OF BIG BOOLGTS AND BIGGER 
MEN BUT IT CAN AFFECT US ALL MEN 
AND WOMEN AND BOYS AND GIRLS SAR 
A H. THAT UNBELIEVABLE IS THE 
WRITING EXERCISE I WAS GIVEN AS A 
CHILD TO CORRECT MY SAGGING ARVES 
WE ARE BORN WITH FLAT FEET THE 
ARCHES ONLY DEVELOPS BETWEEN THE 
AGE OF THREE AND TEN A PAIR OF 
HUMAN FEET CONTAINS OVER THREE HUNDRED 
LIGAMENTS FIFTY TWO BONES AND SIXTY SIX JOINTS 
BETWEEN THEM IN A LIFETIME WE 
WILL TAKE ENOUGH STEPS TO WALK 
AROUND THE WORLD FOUR TIMES NOW 
THE KEY BIT OF ANATOMICAL 
ENGINEERING IN ALL THIS IS THE ARCH 
IT KEEPS YOUR FOOT FLEXIBLE AND 
ALLOWS IT TO ADAPT TO ALL SORTS OF 
SURFACES AND SPEED AND IT ACTS AS 
A SHOCK ABSORBER IF YOUR FOOTPRINT 
LOOKS LIKE THAT THAN THAT YOU 
EITHER NEVER HAD AN ARCH OR IT'S 
SIMPLY COLLAPSED 
IT IS BY NO MEANS A DISASTER 
ALBERT EINSTEIN GOT HIM OUT OF 
SWISS ARMY AND CUSHY JOB 
HAVE BEEN REJECTED AT ALL WANTED WANTED TO SPELL THE MYTH OF HAVING FLAT 
FEET IS NOT A BAR TO THE ARMY IF 
YOU HAVE VERY FLAT FEET THAT IS A 
BAR BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED RISK 
OF KNEE AND ANKLE AND FOOT PROBLEMS 
LIKE STRESS FRACTURES 
FROM BIG FEET TO DELICATE FEET 
NET STILL FLAT FEET THIS WOMAN IS 
A CITY HIGH FLYER IN STYLISH 
DESIGNER SHOES IT'S GLAMOROUS LIFE AL THE PUMPS COME OFF 
YOU GOT BUNONS DO YOU WEAR A LOT 
OF HIGH HEELS 
YES SQUASHING YOUR 
FEET INTO THEM THE CAUSE OF T. IN IN TERMS OF FLATNESS NORMALLY THERE 
WOULD BE AN ARCH WHEN YOU STAND IT 
DISAPPEARS YOU'VE GOT NO ARCH 
YOU'VE DEFINITELY GOT FLAT FEET 
WHAT SYMPTOMS DO YOU GET 
SORE FEET 
AND PAINS IN MY LEGS 
WHAT SIZE 
SHOE DO YOU TAKE 
SIZE FIVE YOU YOU SHOULD BE TAKING A SHOE WHICH IS AT 
LEAST THE CENTIMETRE THAT'S ABOUT 
THAT MUCH LONGER THAN YOUR LONGEST 
TOE FOR YOU THAT'S A SEVEN 
SEVEN 
YOU NEED TO SEE A PODIATRIST SEVEN ELEANOR'S PROBLEM MAY BE DUE TO 
LOOSE LIGAMENTS IN HER HEEL OR AT 
THE BASE OF HER BIG TOE WOMEN ARE 
LOOSER JOINTED THAN MEN OR IT MAY 
BE CAUSED BY A REPETIVE STRAIN 
INJURY 
WE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME INJURY POUNDING FLAT CITY STREETS INSTEAD 
OF GOING BAREFOOT I'VE HAD A LOOK 
AT YOUR FEET YOU HAVE A FLEXIBLE 
FOOT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOUR FEET 
ROLE DOWN AND YOUR AFRBGS LOWER AND 
HEELS TURN OUT THAT PLACES STRESS 
ON THE FRONT OF YOUR FOOT IT IS 
AGO VATED BY TIGHT CALF MUSCLES 
STAND ON THE RAMP HERE 
NORMALLY IF 
YOU HAVE NICE FLEXIBLE MUSCLES YOU 
CAN STAND UPRIGHT YOU FEEL YOUR 
CALVES ARE TIGHT AND YOU'RE ARCHING 
YOUR BACK BECAUSE YOUR CALVES ARE 
INDICT THAT MEANS THE FLATNESS OF 
YOUR FEET WORSE SO WE HAVE TO GIVE 
YOU EXERCISE TO SEE STOP THAT THE THE OTHER THING IS TO THINK ABOUT AN 
INSERT FOR YOUR SHOES IT WILL 
CONTROL THE POSITION OF YOUR FOOT 
AND HELP YOU WALK FORWARD AND TAKE 
THE PRESSURE OFF THE JOINTS 
HORRIFIED I'VE BEEN WEARING THE 
WRONG SIZED SHOES ALL MY LIFE 
WILL TRY THE EXERCISES AND BUY THE 
INSOLES IT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY 
USEFUL 
GOOD NEWS FOR ELEANOR BUT USEFUL WHAT ABOUT YOU NINE OUT OF TEN 
PEOPLE ARE JUST WEARING THE WRONG 
SIZED SHOES SO IF YOUR FEET ARE 
KILLING YOU AT THE END OF THE DAY 
IT MAY BE AS SIMPLE AS TURNING OVER 
YOUR SHOE AND TAKE AGO DEEP LOOK 
INTO YOUR SOLE 
WE'RE IN THE ONE 
SHOW CLINIC L. DON'T BELIEVE THAT 
FOR A SECOND ELEANOR THOUGHT THE 
HAVE A FIVE BUT REALLY SHE'S A 
SEVEN THAT'S RIDICULOUS 
YOU WOULD 
HAVE THOUGHT YOU NEED AT LEAST AN 
INCH IN FRONT OF YOUR TOE L. BET 
YOU PEOPLE WHO WEAR FLAT PUMPS 
THEY HAVE TO CLAW THEIR TOES IN 
ORDER TO STOP THEM FALLING OFF 
I'M 
ORDER TO STOP THEM FALLING OFF I'M A SEVEN DO YOU THINK I NEED A NINE 
THE REST OF US WOULD LOVE YOU NOT 
TO BE PERFECT IN AT LEAST ONE 
RESPECT 
ALL RIGHT THEN RESPECT HIGH HEELS IS A BIG ISSUE WE SAW 
GWYNETH PALTROW'S HEELS I THOUGHT 
THEY WERE HIGH BUT THEN I SAW 
DENISE'S SHOES 
THEY'RE HIGH BUT 
THERE'S A PLATFORM IN THE FRONT 
HERE SO I'M LEVEL 
THE OTHER BIG 
DIFFERENCE IS LADIES SHE DOES NOT 
WEAR THEM ALL THE TIME SHE PUTS 
THEM ON TO APPEAR IN PUBLIC 
YOU DO 
WEAR THEM ALL THE TIME 
COURSE I 
DON'T 
SHE DID TELL ME ALL THE TIME DON'T PEOPLE APPEAR ON THE CATWALK WITH 
THE RIDICULOUSLY HIGH HEELS IF YOU 
LOOK AT THE WOMEN NOW THEY HAVE 
THE APPALLING BUNONS AND YOU'RE 
STORING UP TROUBLE FOR YOURSELF 
THEY HURT WILL BE TINY NOW 
STORING UP TROUBLE FOR YOURSELF THEY HURT I WILL BE TINY NOW 
STORING UP TROUBLE FOR YOURSELF THEY HURT I WILL BE TINY NOW 
DRIP 
DRY DRY I HAVE STRAIGHT TOES BUT A HIGH 
INSTEP YOU WILL HAVE A LOVELY ARCH 
WHAT SIZE OF FEET DO YOU HAVE I'M I'M ELEVEN 
VERY GOOD I'M ON THE TURN I'M ELEVEN COLLAPSING COLLAPSING WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
YOU ARE FAB 
YOU WILL NEVER HAVE ANY PROBLEMS 
WITH YOUR KNEES 
THAT GAP THERE IS 
AS GOOD AS THAT ONE 
IT IS MORE 
DEFINED HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOUR 
INSTEP IS HIGHER WE DON'T HAVE AN 
INSTEP WHEN WE'RE BORN BUT 
GRADUALLY WE LEARN LIGAMENTS MOVE 
AROUND AND BASICALLY THAT 
SUPPORTS THE KNEES ANKLES AND THE 
HIPS SO YOU CAN GET DREADFUL 
PROBLEMS WITH SHIN SPLINTS KNEE 
AND HIP PROBLEMS 
YOU MENTIONED 
YOUR INSTEP TELL THE DOCTOR I I HAVE A HIGH INSTEP I'M GUESSING IT 
IS FROM DANCING 
IT MAY BE BALLET BALLET MORE LIKELY TO BE YOU'RE MADE THAT 
WAY AND YOU'RE LOVELY AND SLIM IF 
WE PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE AND WE'RE 
PUTTING BACK TO OVERWEIGHT YOU PUT 
SO MUCH PRESSURE ON YOUR JOINTS 
WHEN YOU STEP YOU'RE PUTTING THREE 
TO SIX TIMES YOUR WEIGHT THROUGH 
YOUR JOINTS
