FRANCE IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY WAS A KINGDOM IN CHAOS 
WEAKENED BY WAR WITH ENGLAND AND IN FIGHTING AMONG ITS NOBLES 
WITH BLOODLUST IN THE AIR A FATAL FEUD BEGAN 
THAT CAPTURED THE IMAGINATION OF THE CHRONICLER JEAN FROISSART 
DURING THE LONG WARS BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND 
AN INCIDENT TOOK PLACE THAT SET THE WHOLE COUNTRY TALKING 
A DUEL TO THE DEATH IN PARIS 
IT FOLLOWED A DISPUTE WHICH HAD DRAGGED ON FOR OVER A YEAR 
BETWEEN A KNIGHT CALLED SIR JEAN DE CARROUGES AND A SQUIRE CALLED JACQUES LE GRIS 
CARROUGES ACCUSED LE GRIS OF THE BRUTAL RAPE OF HIS SECOND WIFE MARGUERITE 
AND DEMANDED JUSTICE 
I AM PREPARED TO RISK MY LIFE ON THE BATTLEFIELD TO PROVE IT AND EITHER MAKE LE GRIS CONFESS 
OR KILL HIM 
IT'S A BETRAYAL IT'S A STORY OF A FRIENDSHIP BROKEN 
IT'S A STORY OF A WOMAN VIOLATED IT TAKES PLACE IN THE UPPER CLASS 
MARGUERITE'S BEAUTY AND YOUTH 
INSPIRED MANY TO PITY HER AS THE INNOCENT VICTIM OF A VIOLENT MAN 
LE GRIS GAVE UP TRYING TO PERSUADE ME 
HE SAID YOU'LL GO UPSTAIRS WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT 
SHE FIXED FIRMLY IN HER MEMORY THE DAY WHEN JACQUES LE GRIS CAME TO CAPOMESNIL 
BUT NOT EVERYONE BELIEVED MARGUERITE'S STORY 
SOME THOUGHT LE GRIS HIMSELF WAS THE VICTIM 
CARROUGES FORCED MARGUERITE TO FALSELY ACCUSE ME OF HAVING RAPED HER 
WHATEVER THE TRUTH CARROUGES VERSUS LE GRIS BECAME A NOTORIOUS COURT CASE 
WHICH REVEALED A POWER STRUGGLE AT THE HEART OF FRENCH SOCIETY 
AND IT SIGNALLED CHANGING ATTITUDES IN MEDIEVAL JUSTICE AS THIS WOULD 
BE THE LAST TRIAL BY COMBAT PERMITTED BY THE FRENCH PARLIAMENT 
TO PRESERVE THIS HISTORY FOR POSTERITY 
I WANT TO TELL YOU THE EVENTS THAT LED UP TO THIS DUEL 
JUST AS THEY WERE TOLD TO ME 
IT WAS IN THE SUMMER OF ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX 
THAT FRANCE'S SENIOR JUDGES CONVENED IN PARIS TO HEAR THE ACCUSATIONS OF RAPE 
MARGUERITE DE CARROUGES WAS CALLED TO GIVE EVIDENCE ABOUT HOW SHE'D BEEN ATTACKED 
THE ALLEGED CRIME HAPPENED SIX MONTHS BEFORE WHILE SHE WAS ALONE AT A HOUSE CAPOMESNIL IN NORMANDY 
SHE ACCUSED HER HUSBAND'S FORMER FRIEND JACQUES LE GRIS AND AN ACCOMPLICE ADAM LOUVEL 
HE GRABBED ME ROUGHLY BY THE ARMS 
HE LEANED CLOSE AND SAID 
YOU'RE COMING UPSTAIRS WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT 
WHEN I REALISED WHAT HE MEANT I BEGAN SHOUTING FOR HELP AS LOUD AS I COULD 
HARO AIDEZ MOI HARO 
BUT NOBODY COULD HEAR ME 
THEY DRAGGED ME TOWARDS THE STAIRS BUT I RESISTED BY THROWING MYSELF TO THE FLOOR 
SO LE GRIS PICKED ME UP BY MY ARMS AND LOUVEL BY MY LEGS 
AND CARRIED ME TO A BEDROOM UPSTAIRS 
THEN LOUVEL LEFT US ALONE 
ALTHOUGH HE WAS STRONG I FOUGHT HIM SO DESPERATELY 
HE CALLED TO LOUVEL TO COME UP AND HELP HIM 
THEY PINNED ME DOWN AND STUFFED A CAPE OVER MY MOUTH TO SILENCE ME 
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO SUFFOCATE 
AND SOON I COULDN'T FIGHT ANY MORE 
LE GRIS RAPED ME 
MARGUERITE'S SIX HUNDRED YEAR OLD ACCOUNT HAS BEEN RE EXAMINED BY ERIC JAGER 
IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNRAVEL THE LAYERS OF MYTH AND HALF TRUTH WHICH NOW OBSCURE THIS CASE 
THIS DOCUMENT NOW KEPT AT THE ARCHIVES NATIONALES IN PARIS 
IS THE ONLY SURVIVING RECORD OF THE TESTIMONY IN THE CASE 
THAT WAS TAKEN DOWN BY THE PARLIAMENT OF PARIS IN THE SUMMER OF ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX 
WE HAVE THE MOST DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE CRIME THAT MARGUERITE GAVE BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT OF PARIS 
THIS IS INFORMATION THAT SHE SWORE TO NUMEROUS TIMES BEFORE MANY WITNESSES 
IT REINFORCED MY SENSE THAT MARGUERITE'S TESTIMONY WAS DRAMATIC AND POWERFUL 
AND SEEMED TO HAVE THE FLAVOUR OF LIVED EXPERIENCE AND THE TRUTH 
BUT IT ALSO REINFORCED MY SENSE THAT JACQUES LE GRIS HAD A VERY POWERFUL ALIBI 
AND THAT HE HAD VERY GOOD LEGAL REPRESENTATION 
THE DOCUMENT ALSO REVEALS JEAN DE CARROUGES' AND JACQUES LE GRIS' 
DIFFERING VERSIONS OF HOW A CLOSE FRIENDSHIP BECAME A BITTER FEUD 
THEY MET AS NORMAN SQUIRES SERVING THE SAME FEUDAL LORD 
THERE'S A FAMOUS MEDIEVAL STATEMENT 
IF A BOY HAS NOT LEARNT TO RIDE A HORSE AND FIGHT BY THE AGE OF TWELVE 
HE IS GOOD FOR NOTHING EXCEPT TO BE A PRIEST 
JEAN DE CARROUGES WAS A VERY TOUGH MAN HE WAS A FEROCIOUS WARRIOR 
AND THEY WERE A VENERABLE WELL KNOWN FAMILY LOYAL TO THE KINGS OF FRANCE 
AND JEAN DE CARROUGES HIMSELF SEEMS TO HAVE SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME IN BATTLE ON CAMPAIGNS 
JACQUES LE GRIS HAD MADE HIS OWN CHANCES IN LIFE 
JACQUES LE GRIS CAME FROM A VERY DIFFERENT FAMILY 
IT WAS MUCH MORE NEWLY ENNOBLED BUT VERY SUCCESSFUL AT COURT 
APPARENTLY WORKED THE PATRONAGE SYSTEM WELL 
SOCIAL CLIMBERS IF YOU LIKE WHO BY THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTIES 
HAD ACHIEVED A GREAT DEAL OF POWER WEALTH AND STATUS THROUGH THEIR CONNECTIONS 
LE GRIS WAS NOT A MAN OF GOOD FAMILY BUT A SQUIRE OF HUMBLE BIRTH WHO HAD RISEN IN THE WORLD 
FAVOURED BY FORTUNE 
AS MANY PEOPLE ARE 
JEAN FROISSART CLEARLY SIDED WITH CARROUGES IN HIS TELLING OF THE STORY 
HE THAT THOUGHT JACQUES LE GRIS WAS A LOW BORN UPSTART 
HE THOUGHT MUCH MORE HIGHLY OF CARROUGES WHO DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE BEEN A VERY ATTRACTIVE CHARACTER 
SO FAR AS ONE CAN JUDGE 
BUT WAS CERTAINLY BETTER BORN THAN HIS OPPONENT AND THE GREAT 
THING ABOUT FROISSART IS THAT HE WAS AN ABSOLUTELY INCORRIGIBLE SNOB 
FROISSART LIKES A STORY 
AND IT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE THAT SOMETIMES THE DEMANDS OF THE STORY 
HAVE TAKEN PRECEDENT OVER GETTING EVERY SMALL FACT RIGHT 
HE'S NOT SOMEONE YOU COULD GO TO AND SAY THIS IS CERTAINLY HOW IT WAS 
WITHOUT MAYBE CHECKING AND A FEW RESERVATIONS 
CARROUGES' FIRST MARRIAGE WAS TO JEANNE DE TILLY 
WHEN SHE BORE HIM A SON HE CHOSE LE GRIS FOR AN IMPORTANT FAMILY HONOUR 
I PREVIOUSLY HELD LE GRIS TO BE ONE OF MY CLOSEST AND MOST TRUSTED FRIENDS 
I CHOSE HIM TO BE GODFATHER TO MY SON BY MY FIRST WIFE JEANNE DE TILLY 
I SWORE TO GUARD HIM FOR SEVEN YEARS FROM THE DEVIL 
AND PROTECT HIM FOR SEVEN YEARS FROM FIRE WATER HORSE'S FOOT AND HOUND'S TOOTH 
CARROUGES AND LE GRIS ARE RELATED IN CO PATERNITY 
IN THE MEDIEVAL TERM 
WHICH MEANS THAT LE GRIS IS THE GODFATHER OF ONE OF CARROUGES' CHILDREN 
AND THAT WAS TAKEN TO BE IN MEDIEVAL THINKING THE SAME THING AS A BLOOD TIE 
BUT SOME TIME AFTERWARDS THE FRIENDSHIP BEGAN TO TURN SOUR 
CARROUGES ACCUSED LE GRIS OF BEING A SEXUAL PREDATOR 
LE GRIS WAS A PRACTISED WOMANISER 
WHO BRIBED WOMEN TO SLEEP WITH HIM WITH EITHER GIFTS OR EMPTY PROMISES 
ON OCCASION HE EVEN FORCED THEM AGAINST THEIR WILL 
HOWEVER LE GRIS CLAIMED CARROUGES WAS JEALOUS AND IRRATIONAL 
CARROUGES TRIED TO GET HIS WIFE TO SAY THAT I'D SLEPT WITH HER 
BUT JEANNE WHO WAS PURE AND SENSIBLE REFUSED TO DO SO BECAUSE IT JUST WASN'T TRUE 
JACQUES LE GRIS SPENT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME WHEN HE WAS ADDRESSING THE COURT 
EXPLAINING WHAT A DISREPUTABLE FELLOW CARROUGES WAS 
HE ALSO SAID THAT CARROUGES HAD A RECORD OF MAKING UNJUSTIFIED ACCUSATIONS OF RAPE 
WHEN JEANNE DE TILLY DIED YOUNG LE GRIS BLAMED CARROUGES 
HE WAS MOODY AND INSANELY JEALOUS 
HE FORCED HER TO LEAD SUCH AN AUSTERE LIFE THAT SHE DIED AN EARLY DEATH 
BUT THE CAUSE MAY HAVE BEEN A TRAGIC ILLNESS 
CARROUGES ALSO LOST HIS SON A FEW MONTHS LATER 
ONE EXPLANATION OF SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED DEATH IN THIS PERIOD WOULD BE EPIDEMIC 
THE ONSET OF THE GREAT PLAGUES IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT ONWARDS 
PEOPLE ARE VERY PRONE VERY VULNERABLE INDEED 
TO WHAT MIGHT IN MODERN TIMES BE THOUGHT OF AS MINOR INFECTIONS 
BUT WHICH IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COULD BE KILLERS 
THE TWO SQUIRES GREW FURTHER APART AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR FEUDAL LORD 
THEY NOW BECAME VASSALS OF THE KING'S POWERFUL COUSIN COUNT PIERRE 
HE BUILT A NEW COURT AT ARGENTAN 
JACQUES LE GRIS IN PARTICULAR WAS HIGH IN THE COUNT'S FAVOUR 
HE WAS ESPECIALLY FOND OF HIM AND PLACED GREAT TRUST IN HIM 
CARROUGES WAS A RATHER TROUBLESOME QUARRELSOME MAN 
AND APPARENTLY DID NOT GET A GOOD START IN THAT COURT 
WHEREAS LE GRIS SEEMS TO HAVE ADAPTED EASILY TO THE NEW ENVIRONMENT 
AND QUICKLY TO HAVE BECOME COUNT PIERRE'S FAVOURITE 
THE FOLLOWING YEAR COUNT PIERRE CAUSED MORE ILL FEELING 
BY BUYING A VALUABLE ESTATE IN NORMANDY CALLED AUNOU LE FAUCON AND GIFTING IT TO LE GRIS 
THIS IS THE PIECE OF LAND THAT FIRST DROVE JEAN DE CARROUGES AND JACQUES LE GRIS APART 
ONE OF THE DOCUMENTS I FOUND IN PARIS REVEALS THAT OFFICIALLY AT LEAST 
COUNT PIERRE GAVE THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY TO LE GRIS 
AS A KIND OF RETURN ON FAVOURS AND SERVICES THAT LE GRIS HAD PERFORMED 
INCLUDING A SUBSTANTIAL LOAN AND POSSIBLY MILITARY SERVICE AS WELL 
STRATEGICALLY IT'S CLOSE TO ARGENTAN AND IT'S SITUATED NEXT TO 
COUNT PIERRE'S OWN DOMAIN AND SO HAS A CERTAIN PRESTIGE TO IT 
BUT IT ALSO SEEMS TO BE VERY GOOD FARMLAND 
PHYSICAL OWNERSHIP OF LAND WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR ANYBODY WITH ANY CLAIM TO NOBILITY 
LAND IS THE ORIGIN OF NOBLE STATUS 
SO HERE WE'VE GOT A CLASS WHICH IS VERY ROOTED IN THE LAND ON THE LAND 
WHICH IS INVOLVED IN CONSTANT LAWSUITS IN WHICH OTHERS TRY TO UNDERMINE THEIR TITLES 
THE GIFT TO LE GRIS OF PRIME LAND WITH GOOD RENTAL INCOME INFURIATED CARROUGES 
AND SOON HE FOUND REASON TO FEEL EVEN MORE AGGRIEVED 
IN HIS LATE FORTIES HE MARRIED THE TEENAGE HEIRESS MARGUERITE DE THIBOUVILLE 
DAUGHTER OF THE MAN WHO'D SOLD THE LAND TO THE COUNT 
JEAN DE CARROUGES REALISES 
PIECE OF LAND THROUGH HIS NEW WIFE MARGUERITE FROM HER FATHER AS PART OF HER DOWRY 
THE COVETED LAND WAS MISSING FROM THE WEDDING TRANSACTION 
WHICH TOOK PLACE IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY AT THE PARISH CHURCH OF SAINT MARGUERITE DE CARROUGES 
JEAN AND MARGUERITE WOULD HAVE APPEARED FIRST ON THE CHURCH PORCH 
TO EXCHANGE VOWS AND ALSO TO EXCHANGE PROPERTY 
THIS WAS A VERY IMPORTANT CIVIL CEREMONY IN WHICH THE PROPERTY 
BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE WAS OFFICIALLY EXCHANGED 
AND TO THE NORMAN NOBILITY THIS MAY IN FACT HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SERVICE THAT FOLLOWED 
CARROUGES BEGAN A LONG RUNNING BUT ULTIMATELY UNSUCCESSFUL LAWSUIT TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE LAND 
JEAN DE CARROUGES MAKES SUCH A FUSS ABOUT THIS PIECE OF LAND AUNOU LE FAUCON 
THAT EVENTUALLY THE FRENCH KING HAS TO INTERVENE IN THE AFFAIR 
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE FRENCH NOBILITY IS THEIR REMARKABLE TENDENCY TOWARDS FEUDING 
PRIVATE WAR PRIVATE FEUD IS SOMETHING WHICH THEY ALMOST TREASURE 
CARROUGES GOT IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT I WAS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR ALL HIS PROBLEMS BECAUSE I WAS CLOSE TO THE COUNT AND HAD HIS TRUST 
IT POISONED HIM AND LED TO A MALICIOUS HATRED FOR ME 
I WOULD SAY THIS IS A CRUCIAL PART OF THE QUARREL 
AND REMAINED AN OBSESSION OF JEAN DE CARROUGES' FOR QUITE SOME TIME 
HER DOWRY APART MARGUERITE WAS THE IDEAL BRIDE 
THE KNIGHT MARRIED A WOMAN WHO WAS YOUNG BEAUTIFUL SENSIBLE AND MODEST IN HER BEHAVIOUR 
SECOND MARRIAGE THIRD MARRIAGE FOURTH MARRIAGE IS VERY COMMON IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
NORMALLY TO MUCH YOUNGER WOMEN 
AND THE REASON THAT LIES BEHIND THIS IS OF COURSE THE REPRODUCTION OF HEIRS 
MARGUERITE IS FROM THE ARISTOCRACY SO SHE'S BROUGHT UP 
NOT EXPECTING TO ENGAGE IN MANUAL WORK OTHER THAN PROBABLY EMBROIDERY 
WHICH ARISTOCRATIC LADIES WERE TRAINED IN IT GAVE THEM SOMETHING TO DO IN THE EVENINGS 
SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY DESTINED FOR MARRIAGE 
THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE SEXUAL SEGREGATION 
WOMEN AND MEN DIDN'T MEET FREELY AND EASILY 
SO SHE'S IN A WORLD WITH QUITE A LOT OF STRICT RULES BUT ALSO FROM THE POINT OF VIEW 
OF HAVING ENOUGH TO EAT AND NOT HAVING TO WORK A VERY PRIVILEGED SITUATION IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
THERE'S ONLY ONE SKETCHY IMAGE OF MARGUERITE WHICH WAS DRAWN YEARS AFTER HER DEATH 
ALL SOURCES DESCRIBE HER AS A GREAT BEAUTY 
THERE'S VERY MUCH A CONVENTIONAL IDEAL OF BEAUTY IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
ROMANCE LADIES TEND TO HAVE FAIR HAIR 
GOLDEN HAIR PALE SKIN 
THEY'RE SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS HAVING RED AND WHITE COMPLEXIONS 
A BROAD FOREHEAD 
THE NEWLYWEDS LIVED TWELVE MILES FROM ARGENTAN 
AT THE CHATEAU DE CARROUGES WHICH JEAN HAD BUILT TWENTY YEARS EARLIER 
IT WAS NOT NECESSARILY A LARGE PLACE AND THE BUILDINGS THAT EXISTED AT THE TIME 
WERE VERY LIKELY BUILT WITH MILITARY PROTECTION FOREMOST IN MIND 
THE TOWER THE KEEP THAT STILL EXISTS HAS ARROW SLITS TO FEND OFF MARAUDING ENEMIES 
AT THE TIME THE FRENCH WERE THREATENED BY A LONG RUNNING ENGLISH CLAIM TO THEIR LANDS AND THRONE 
KNOWN AS THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR 
THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY IN FRANCE IS A PERIOD OF CRISIS 
THE MONARCHY IS UNDER SEVERE ATTACK FROM THE ENGLISH CLAIM 
IT'S A PERIOD OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CRISIS WITH THE BLACK DEATH 
THE GREAT PLAGUE 
AND THEN A SERIES OF INTERNAL PROBLEMS WHICH GIVES RISE IN EFFECT 
TO CONDITIONS OF CIVIL WAR BY THE END OF THE CENTURY 
CARROUGES WAS ESTRANGED FROM LE GRIS SO HIS FORMER FRIEND 
DIDN'T MEET MARGUERITE UNTIL FOUR YEARS AFTER THE WEDDING 
IT WAS CHRISTMAS ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR 
MARGUERITE AND I AND MANY OTHER NOBLES WERE INVITED TO A FEAST BY A FRIEND CALLED JEAN CRESPIN 
HE WAS CELEBRATING HIS WIFE'S SAFE RECOVERY FROM CHILDBIRTH 
WHO IS IN THE CROWD BUT JACQUES LE GRIS AMONG THE OTHER CELEBRATING NOBLES 
AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN A MOMENT WHEN THIS QUARREL TOOK A VERY BAD TURN EVEN BECAME VIOLENT 
BUT IN FACT IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A MOMENT OF RAPPROCHEMENT 
CARROUGES MADE AN UNEXPECTED GESTURE 
AS A SIGN OF FRIENDSHIP 
I TURNED TO MARGUERITE AND ASKED HER TO KISS LE GRIS 
KISSES WERE QUITE COMMON IN MEDIEVAL SOCIETY TO CEMENT 
RELATIONSHIPS OF VARIOUS KINDS BETWEEN LORD AND VASSAL 
BETWEEN CHRISTIANS AT CHURCH 
AND OF COURSE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE IN MARRIAGE SO THIS WAS NOT ENTIRELY UNUSUAL 
MARGUERITE WAS GIVEN THE ROLE OF THE PEACEMAKER 
BUT DID AN INNOCENT KISS RE INFLAME THE CONFLICT 
THERE IS HUGE ANXIETY ABOUT TOUCHING AND ILLICIT TOUCHING 
IT'S AN AGE WHEN MEN AND WOMEN ARE VERY MUCH KEPT APART 
THERE'S SUCH A KEEN SENSE 
THAT WOMEN ARE NATURALLY SEXUAL AND PROVOCATIVE 
IT WAS AFTER THAT ENCOUNTER AT CRESPIN'S HOME THAT LE GRIS BEGAN TO LUST AFTER MY WIFE 
HE PLOTTED TO SEDUCE MARGUERITE AND ADD HER TO HIS LONG LIST OF CONQUESTS 
SO WHY HAD CARROUGES INSTIGATED THE KISS 
I WONDER IF THERE ISN'T A KIND OF SENSE THAT THE KNIGHT IS SHOWING OFF HIS BEAUTIFUL WIFE TO HIS RIVAL 
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY SHE'S AN ASPECT OF HIS PROPERTY 
WHEN CARROUGES WENT TO WAR THE FOLLOWING YEAR 
HE LEFT HIS PROPERTY SAFE IN THE CARE OF HER PARENTS AT FONTAINE LE SOREL 
HE WENT OVERSEAS TO SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND IN THE HOPE OF BRINGING BACK RICH SPOILS 
THE FRENCH ALL THOUGHT WHY SHOULDN'T WE GO OVER TO ENGLAND FOR ONCE 
HAVE A LOOK AT THE COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE 
WE'LL GET TO KNOW OUR WAY ABOUT THERE JUST AS THE ENGLISH DID IN THEIR TURN IN FRANCE 
MANY NOBLES WERE CASH POOR FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS 
ONE REASON WAS THE FACT THAT INCOME FROM LAND WAS DECLINING 
THAT THE LEVEL OF RENTS WERE DECREASING 
AND THAT THEREFORE YOU NEEDED OTHER MEANS OF SUPPORT 
AND ONE OF THE MAJOR MEANS OF SUPPORT FOR ANY NOBLE 
WAS SERVICE IN WAR FOR MONETARY PAYMENT 
THE CROSS CHANNEL EXPEDITION WHICH LASTED FROM MAY UNTIL NOVEMBER WAS A DISASTER 
FRENCH TACTICS TO TRAP THE ENGLISH ARMY WENT BADLY WRONG AND THEY RETURNED HOME IN DISARRAY 
CARROUGES GAINED JUST ONE THING FROM THE CAMPAIGN 
A PROMOTION FROM SQUIRE TO KNIGHT 
THE FRENCH DID NOT RECOUP THEIR INVESTMENT IN HORSES AND ARMOUR AND WEAPONS AND SUPPLIES 
IT WAS A VERY EXPENSIVE UNDERTAKING AND JEAN DE CARROUGES CAME BACK 
IF NOT BANKRUPT MUCH POORER THAN HE LEFT AND HAD AN EVEN BIGGER FINANCIAL PROBLEM FACING HIM 
ON HIS RETURN CARROUGES AND MARGUERITE 
WENT TO STAY WITH HIS MOTHER NICOLE AT CAPOMESNIL BESIDE THE RIVER VIE 
BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY CARROUGES SET OFF FOR PARIS TO COLLECT HIS MILITARY PAY 
BEFORE I LEFT I INSTRUCTED MARGUERITE'S MAIDSERVANT TO REMAIN ALWAYS AT HER SIDE 
THERE WAS DEEP ANXIETY ABOUT KEEPING THE LADY CHASTE BECAUSE IT WAS SO IMPORTANT 
UM THAT IF SHE PRODUCED AN HEIR 
IT SHOULD BE YOUR HEIR 
CARROUGES BROKE HIS JOURNEY AT ARGENTAN WHERE HE ENCOUNTERED LE GRIS 
I TOLD LE GRIS AND OTHERS THAT I WAS GOING TO PARIS WHERE I ARRIVED DURING THE THIRD WEEK OF JANUARY 
IT THEN HAPPENED 
AND THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT AT ISSUE 
THAT THROUGH A STRANGE PERVERSE TEMPTATION THE DEVIL ENTERED THE BODY OF JACQUES LE GRIS 
AND HE BECAME FIXATED WITH POSSESSING CARROUGES' WIFE 
ON THURSDAY EIGHTEENTH JANUARY 
MARGUERITE CLAIMED SHE WAS TARGETED BY JACQUES LE GRIS AND HIS CO CONSPIRATOR ADAM LOUVEL 
MY MOTHER IN LAW NICOLE DE CARROUGES WAS SUMMONED TO A COURT HEARING IN SAINT PIERRE SUR DIVES 
TO ANSWER A COMPLAINT FROM ONE OF HER VASSALS 
SHE TOOK MY MAID WITH HER AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD 
LEAVING ME VIRTUALLY ALONE IN CAPOMESNIL ALL MORNING 
AFTER NICOLE LEFT MARGUERITE WAS APPROACHED BY LOUVEL WHOM SHE MAY HAVE KNOWN BY SIGHT 
ADAM LOUVEL CAME TO THE HOUSE PRETENDING TO BEG ME TO INTERCEDE 
WITH MY HUSBAND OVER A DEBT OF ONE HUNDRED GOLD FRANCS 
BUT ONCE I LET HIM INSIDE HE REVEALED HIS TRUE INTENTIONS 
HE CARRIED GREETINGS FROM JACQUES LE GRIS 
WHO HE SAID ADMIRED ME GREATLY 
AND WANTED TO TALK WITH ME 
I SAID TO LOUVEL I DID NOT WANT TO SPEAK TO THE SQUIRE 
AND I WAS INSULTED BY HIS ATTEMPTS TO SOLICIT MY AFFECTIONS FOR HIM 
AS I WAS SPEAKING THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN AND LE GRIS WALKED IN 
HE CAME CLOSE TO ME 
AND SAID MY LADY I LOVE YOU 
I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU ALL I HAVE IS YOURS 
I WAS FRIGHTENED 
AND I SAID I REFUSED TO LISTEN TO SUCH OFFENSIVE FLATTERY 
HE SAID HE KNEW ALL ABOUT MY HUSBAND'S FINANCIAL TROUBLES 
AND OFFERED ME MONEY 
IF I WOULD SLEEP WITH HIM 
I SAID I CARED NOTHING FOR HIS MONEY 
SO LE GRIS PICKED ME UP BY MY ARMS AND LOUVEL BY MY LEGS 
I BEGAN SHOUTING FOR HELP AS LOUD AS I COULD 
HARO AIDEZ MOI HARO 
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO SUFFOCATE 
PINNED ME DOWN STUFFED A CAPE OVER MY MOUTH 
FOUGHT HIM SO DESPERATELY AIDEZ MOI 
SOON I COULDN'T FIGHT ANY MORE 
AFTER IT WAS ALL OVER 
HE STOOD OVER THE WEEPING WOMAN AND ADVISED HER VERY SWEETLY 
NOT TO TELL HER HUSBAND OR ANYONE ELSE 
HE SAID SHE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO PROVE IT THAT SHE WOULD BE PUBLICLY HUMILIATED 
AND THAT HER HUSBAND MIGHT EVEN KILL HER OUT OF SHAME 
LE GRIS OFFERED HER A BAG OF COINS TO BUY HER SILENCE 
I SAID I CARED NOTHING FOR HIM OR HIS MONEY 
AND THAT I'D BE REVENGED ON HIM WHEN MY HUSBAND RETURNED 
IN THE MEANTIME MARGUERITE TOLD NO ONE 
ON THAT TERRIBLE DAY 
LADY CARROUGES DIDN'T REPORT ANYTHING FOR FEAR OF BEING BLAMED RATHER THAN PITIED 
BUT SHE FIXED FIRMLY IN HER MEMORY THE DAY WHEN JACQUES LE GRIS CAME TO CAPOMESNIL 
WE CAN BE CERTAIN THAT MARGUERITE DIDN'T CONFIDE IN HER MOTHER IN LAW 
LE GRIS GLEANED THAT INFORMATION FROM NICOLE'S BROTHER 
WHEN NICOLE DE CARROUGES ARRIVED BACK AT CAPOMESNIL AROUND LUNCHTIME 
SHE FOUND MARGUERITE IN A GOOD MOOD 
THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF DISTRESS OR UPSET 
BUT WHEN CARROUGES REACHED HOME HE IMMEDIATELY NOTICED A CHANGE IN HIS WIFE 
MARGUERITE WASN'T HER USUAL SELF 
SHE WAS SAD AND TEARFUL 
AND SEEMED UNABLE TO SMILE ANY MORE 
AT FIRST I THOUGHT SHE'D HAD A DISAGREEMENT WITH MY MOTHER 
IN ORDER TO GET JUSTICE OF ANY KIND IN SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE SHE HAD TO VERY CAREFULLY HANDLE 
WHO WAS TOLD FIRST AND HOW THAT PERSON WAS TOLD 
IT IS ALSO THE FACT THAT AFTER THIS CRIME SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN IMMENSELY TRAUMATISED 
SO BLURTING OUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER MOTHER IN LAW 
WAS PROBABLY THE LAST THING SHE SHOULD DO OR WANTED TO DO 
THAT DAY PASSED NIGHT CAME CARROUGES WENT TO BED 
BUT HIS WIFE REFUSED TO LIE DOWN 
SHE PACED THE ROOM DEEP IN THOUGHT 
AT FIRST HE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT 
BUT SHE WAS SO INSISTENT THAT HE BEGAN TO BELIEVE HER 
SHE SWORE TO ME SHE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH TIME AND AGAIN REPEATING HER TESTIMONY ON THE PERIL OF HER SOUL 
SHE BEGGED ME FOR THE SAKE OF HER HONOUR TO PUNISH THE PERPETRATOR 
FINALLY HE SAID ALL RIGHT THEN LADY 
IF IT HAPPENED AS YOU SAY I FORGIVE YOU AND THE SQUIRE WILL DIE FOR IT 
BUT IF I FIND OUT YOU ARE LYING 
YOU WILL NEVER LIVE WITH ME AGAIN 
CARROUGES IMMEDIATELY INSTRUCTED A LAWYER 
THE CHARGES THAT ARE LISTED HERE ARE NOT JUST ONE BUT ACTUALLY FIVE 
AND THEY BEGIN WITH RAPE WHICH WAS THE MOST SERIOUS CHARGE OF COURSE 
AND THEN THE SECOND CHARGE IS ADULTERY BECAUSE OF THE ILLICIT SEX 
AND THEN TREACHERY 
BECAUSE JACQUES LE GRIS HAD BETRAYED HIS FRIEND JEAN DE CARROUGES 
INCEST A LITTLE SURPRISINGLY 
BECAUSE JEAN DE CARROUGES HAD SELECTED JACQUES LE GRIS TO BE GODFATHER TO ONE OF HIS CHILDREN 
AND SO THERE WAS A VIOLATION OF THAT RELATIONSHIP AND FINALLY PERJURY 
BECAUSE JACQUES LE GRIS WAS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT THE ENTIRE CRIME 
CARROUGES BROUGHT THE PROSECUTION SINCE A WOMAN WASN'T ALLOWED TO BRING A RAPE CHARGE 
TO MEDIEVAL MINDS HE WAS ALSO AN INJURED PARTY 
IF YOU HAVE A RANGE WHERE SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST A WOMAN IS AT ONE END 
AND A MALE ARISTOCRAT'S PROPERTY HAS BEEN INFRINGED AT THE OTHER END 
IN HOW YOU CAN VIEW THIS 
I THINK PROBABLY IN MANY OF THESE CASES THE BALANCE IS TOWARDS 
THE MALE ARISTOCRAT'S PROPERTY HIS WIFE HAS BEEN VIOLATED 
THE CASE AUTOMATICALLY CAME UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF COUNT PIERRE THE LORD WHO FAVOURED LE GRIS 
JACQUES LE GRIS MAINTAINED HIS INNOCENCE SAYING THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO TRUTH IN THE CHARGE 
AND THAT THE LADY WAS MAKING A FALSE ACCUSATION 
HE WAS AT A LOSS HE SAID IN HIS SPEECH TO KNOW WHY THE LADY HATED HIM 
SURPRISINGLY NEITHER CARROUGES NOR MARGUERITE ATTENDED ALLOWING COUNT PIERRE TO CLEAR LE GRIS 
THE COUNT MADE A FORMAL ORDER FOR THE CHARGE TO BE ANNULLED 
AND FOR NO FURTHER QUESTIONS EVER TO BE ASKED ABOUT IT 
HE SAID THE LADY MUST HAVE DREAMT IT 
WHY ON EARTH HADN'T CARROUGES FOLLOWED UP HIS VERY PUBLIC ACCUSATIONS 
IF I HAD BEEN IN CARROUGES' POSITION 
I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE REGARDED THE COUNT OF ALENCON AS MY FAVOURITE TRIBUNAL 
OF COURSE YOU CAN'T ALWAYS CHOOSE YOUR TRIBUNAL UNFORTUNATELY BUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF CHOOSING 
THE RIGHT COURT FOR YOU WERE RATHER GREATER IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY THAN 
CARROUGES' NON APPEARANCE AT ARGENTAN MAY HAVE BEEN DELIBERATELY PLANNED 
JEAN DE CARROUGES MAY HAVE STOMACHED THE POSSIBILITY OF LE GRIS BEING DECLARED INNOCENT 
IN THE FRIENDLY HOME COURT IN ORDER TO GET THE JUSTICE HE KNEW HE NEEDED IN PARIS 
TO COUNT PIERRE'S FURY 
CARROUGES WENT OVER HIS HEAD AND APPEALED DIRECTLY TO THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD KING OF FRANCE CHARLES THE SIXTH 
FOR THE RIGHT TO A JUDICIAL DUEL 
THE JUDICIAL DUEL WAS PERMITTED BY THE FRENCH CROWN 
IN CASES OF A NUMBER OF SERIOUS AND VIOLENT UNWITNESSED CRIMES 
SUCH AS HOMICIDE TREASON RAPE 
THE CROWN WAS PREPARED TO ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE NOBILITY 
TO EXERCISE THIS RIGHT WHICH THEY CLAIMED TO PUT THEIR QUARRELS TO THE TEST OF COMBAT 
THE DUEL WAS AN INCREASINGLY RARE FORM OF TRIAL IN WHICH DEATH DETERMINED THE GUILTY PARTY 
WHY WAS CARROUGES RISKING HIS LIFE INSTEAD OF OPTING FOR A CONVENTIONAL TRIAL 
I THINK CARROUGES WANTED THAT DUEL 
I THINK HE WAS THE SORT OF MAN 
WHO WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITH THE SLOW TURNING OF JUSTICE 
THAT WOULD RESULT MAYBE IN LE GRIS' ULTIMATE DEATH FOR THE CRIME BY HANGING 
OR A FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT OF SOME SORT 
I THINK HE WAS THE SORT OF MAN WHO WANTED TO LOOK HIS ENEMY IN THE EYE AND KILL HIM 
A DUEL WOULD ALLOW CARROUGES A CHANCE TO KILL LE GRIS LEGITIMATELY 
BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AS THE MONARCHY DISCOURAGED FIGHTING BETWEEN NOBLES 
CERTAIN CHARGES WORKED BETTER THAN OTHERS 
IF WE WORK FROM THE ASSUMPTION 
THAT THE ULTIMATE GOAL WAS TO HAVE A DUEL 
THEN A RAPE ACCUSATION 
WORKS ESPECIALLY WELL 
BECAUSE IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO PROVE 
THERE AREN'T MANY JUSTIFICATIONS TO HAVE A DUEL 
HOMICIDE MIGHT BE ONE BUT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PRODUCE THE BODY 
AND SO IT MAKES SENSE 
IF THERE'S AN INTEREST IN HOLDING A DUEL THAT THE ACCUSATION MIGHT BE RAPE 
THIS IS SUPPORTED BY MARGUERITE'S TESTIMONY 
HER DESCRIPTION OF CRYING HARO A NORMAN WORD FOR HELP APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY CALCULATED 
A KNOWLEDGEABLE EXPERT ON NORMAN LAW IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY WOULD HAVE KNOWN 
THAT IF YOU SHOUT HARO THROUGH A WINDOW 
IT HAS CERTAIN LEGAL CONSEQUENCES 
IT MEANT THAT ANYONE PASSING BY 
COULD TAKE THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS TO SOME EXTENT 
AND ALSO AND CRUCIALLY 
IT MEANT THAT THE SUPERIOR LORD OF THE AREA IN QUESTION IN THIS CASE THE KING 
WOULD HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE OFFENCE 
NOW I DON'T SUPPOSE FOR A MOMENT THAT MARGUERITE KNEW ANY OF THAT 
BUT HER HUSBAND'S LAWYER CERTAINLY DID 
THE TESTIMONY ALSO HAS ECHOES OF A LITERARY WORK 
THE RAPE OF LUCRETIA BY THE ROMAN HISTORIAN LIVY 
IT'S A STORY THAT'S RELEVANT TO MARGUERITE PARTLY BECAUSE LUCRETIA IS A WIFE 
PARTLY BECAUSE SHE'S RAPED AT HOME BUT THERE'S ANOTHER RELEVANCE TOO 
SHE'S RAPED IN A SENSE 
AS A RESULT OF A KIND OF RIVALRY BETWEEN HER HUSBAND COLLATINUS 
AND SEXTUS TARQUINIUS 
WHO HEARS COLLATINUS DESCRIBE HIS WIFE'S GREAT BEAUTY 
IT'S A STORY WHERE THE OUTCOME'S VERY DIFFERENT BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE 
SUCH STRIKING PARALLELS IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE RAPE ITSELF OF THE EVENTS THAT SURROUND IT 
OF THE KIND OF RESISTANCE THAT MARGUERITE OFFERS 
IT'S HARD NOT TO BE STRUCK BY THOSE 
WAS MARGUERITE'S SUFFERING EMBROIDERED TO ENSURE A DUEL 
FABRICATED BY CARROUGES 
OR WAS MARGUERITE LYING 
RAPE IS AN OFFENCE WHICH IS SURROUNDED BY VERY INTENSE EMOTIONS 
WITH ALL THE DISTORTING EFFECTS THAT INTENSE EMOTIONS NECESSARILY HAVE 
ON THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE THAT IS BEING PRODUCED 
IT'S A CASE IN WHICH IT IS NOTORIOUS 
THAT WOMEN MAY 
INVENT A STORY EITHER TOTALLY 
OR BECAUSE THEY HAD CONSENSUAL SEX AND THEN BITTERLY REGRETTED IT 
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S THE NORM 
BUT ALL EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS THAT IT HAPPENS OFTEN ENOUGH 
FOR JURIES AND JUDGES TO APPROACH ALLEGATIONS OF RAPE WITH VERY GREAT CARE 
IN JULY WITH THE KING'S PERMISSION CARROUGES CHALLENGED LE GRIS 
I DEMAND THAT JACQUES LE GRIS NOW CONFESSES HIS CRIME 
SUBMITTING TO THE JUDGMENT OF THIS COURT AND TO THE PENALTY OF DEATH 
AND THE CONFISCATION OF ALL HIS GOODS 
CARROUGES THREW DOWN THE GAUNTLET 
LE GRIS ACCEPTED 
I PLEDGE TO DEFEND MYSELF FROM HIS CHARGES WITH MY BODY 
IF YOUR COURT JUDGES THAT A WAGER OF BATTLE SHALL TAKE PLACE 
THE KING TRANSFERRED THE CASE TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE PARLIAMENT OF PARIS THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEAL 
TODAY THE SAME ROOM IN THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE HOUSES FRANCE'S HIGHEST CIVIL COURT 
CARROUGES VERSUS LE GRIS HAD BECOME SO HIGH PROFILE 
THAT THE BOY KING AND HIS REGENT UNCLES SAT IN FOR THE OPENING ARGUMENTS 
CARROUGES HAD TO PROVE FOUR THINGS 
HE HAD TO PROVE THAT THE OFFENCE HAD BEEN COMMITTED BY SOMEBODY 
HE HAD TO PROVE THAT THE OFFENCE IF IT WAS COMMITTED WAS A CAPITAL OFFENCE OTHER THAN THEFT 
HE HAD TO PROVE THAT IF IT WAS COMMITTED IT WAS DISCREDITABLE 
TO THE PERSON AGAINST WHOM THE ALLEGATION WAS MADE 
AND ABOVE ALL AND THIS WAS THE PRINCIPAL REQUIREMENT 
HE HAD TO PROVE THAT IT WAS AN OFFENCE WHICH COULD NOT REASONABLY BE PROVED BY WITNESS EVIDENCE 
MARGUERITE WAS ALSO CALLED 
WE'VE ALREADY HEARD HER VERSION OF EVENTS 
BY ALL ACCOUNTS SHE MADE A CREDIBLE WITNESS IMPRESSING EVEN LE GRIS' CELEBRATED LAWYER JEAN LE COQ 
CARROUGES' WIFE NEVER FALTERED UNDER CROSS EXAMINATION 
AND INSISTED TIME AND AGAIN THAT THE RAPE REALLY HAD HAPPENED 
LE COQ KEPT A CASEBOOK IN WHICH HE JOTTED PROFESSIONAL NOTES AND PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS IN LATIN 
IT WAS PUBLISHED AFTER HIS DEATH AS ONE OF THE FIRST LEGAL MEMOIRS 
LE COQ ADVISED LE GRIS WHO HELD A CLERICAL STATUS TO OPT FOR A SOFTER CHURCH COURT 
I URGED LE GRIS TO EXERCISE HIS RIGHT TO BENEFIT OF CLERGY 
BUT THE SQUIRE WAS STUBBORN 
HE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME AND REFUSED TO HELP HIMSELF 
WHEN THE JUDGES OFFERED HIM A CHANCE TO SETTLE WITH CARROUGES HE WASN'T INTERESTED 
JEAN LE COQ'S GREAT PROBLEM WHEN HE ARGUED THIS CASE BEFORE THE PARLEMENT DE PARIS 
WAS THAT THE ONLY ISSUE BEFORE THE COURT WAS WHETHER THE COURT OUGHT TO ORDER A JUDICIAL DUEL TO BE FOUGHT 
AND HIS CLIENT WAS ACTUALLY QUITE HAPPY TO FIGHT A JUDICIAL DUEL 
THAT CLEARLY MADE HIS TIME AS AN ADVOCATE RATHER DIFFICULT 
LE GRIS COULD HAVE STOPPED THE DUEL AT ANY TIME 
LE GRIS WAS A CLERIC 
HAD HE MADE THIS KNOWN TO THE PARLIAMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A DUEL 
BECAUSE CLERICS COULD NOT FIGHT PERIOD 
WHY DIDN'T LE GRIS TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT 
MAYBE LE GRIS THOUGHT HE WAS REALLY GOING TO WIN 
HE DESCRIBES HIS OPPONENT CARROUGES AS MELANCHOLY 
AND ONE WOULD SAY IN MODERN TERMS RATHER PSYCHOLOGICALLY UNSTABLE 
AND HE THINKS THAT MAYBE HE THINKS HE'S GOT A GOOD CHANCE OF ACTUALLY GOING IN THERE AND FIGHTING IT OUT 
HE OBVIOUSLY FANCIED HIS CHANCES OF WINNING THE DUEL 
MORE THAN HE FANCIED HIS CHANCES OF PERSUADING A CRIMINAL JUDGE 
LE GRIS' PERVERSE BEHAVIOUR MADE LE COQ SUSPICIOUS 
THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS THAT MADE ME DOUBT MY CLIENT 
FIRST HE TOLD ME THAT WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS THAT CARROUGES INTENDED TO 
PROSECUTE HIM HE IMMEDIATELY WENT TO A PRIEST TO MAKE CONFESSION 
SECONDLY HE ASKED ME WHETHER IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO GIVE AN ALIBI 
AND THIRD HE ONCE DIRECTLY ASKED ME WHETHER I HAD DOUBTS CONCERNING HIM 
BECAUSE HE SAW ME THINKING 
SETTING HIS DOUBTS ASIDE LE COQ HELPED LE GRIS TO PREPARE HIS ALIBI 
ON THE MONDAY OF THAT WEEK I VISITED MY FRIEND JEAN BELOTEAU TO ATTEND HIS WIFE'S FUNERAL MASS 
I REMAINED THERE UNTIL WEDNESDAY SEVENTEENTH WHEN I RETURNED TO ARGENTAN AT COUNT PIERRE'S COMMAND 
I DINED WITH THE COUNT AND SPENT THE NIGHT AT HIS CHATEAU 
THE NEXT MORNING I WAS WOKEN BY MY FRIENDS PIERRE TAILLEPIE AND PIERRE BELOTEAU 
I WENT TO MASS WITH THEM AND REMAINED WITH THEM ALL MORNING 
THE COUNT INVITED US ALL TO LUNCH 
WHICH WAS HELD PUBLICLY 
AFTER DINING AND TAKING WINE AND SPICES I WENT TO BED 
A LITTLE THE WORSE FOR WEAR UNTIL SUPPER TIME 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME SUCH AS THIS 
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THE DISTANCE FROM ARGENTAN TO CAPOMESNIL IS TWENTY FIVE MILES 
ON BAD AND DIFFICULT ROADS 
IT WOULD TAKE AT LEAST A FULL DAY'S TRAVEL IN WINTER 
IT'S BEYOND BELIEF THAT I FIFTY ISH AND ALREADY ENTERING OLD AGE COULD WITHIN A FEW HOURS 
GALLOP TWENTY FIVE MILES AND ATTACK MARGUERITE 
IN A STRUGGLE SO VIGOROUS THAT I NEEDED THE HELP OF A SECOND MAN 
LE GRIS ENLISTED THE HELP OF A CERTAIN ADAM LOUVEL THE ARCHITECT OF MANY OF HIS PREVIOUS SEDUCTIONS 
LOUVEL HAD A HOUSE NEAR CAPOMESNIL 
IT SEEMS THAT ADAM LOUVEL NOT ONLY KNEW LE GRIS HE ALSO KNEW CARROUGES FROM THE PAST 
THERE'S A MONTRE A MILITARY RECEIPT 
WAS ONE OF SEVERAL SQUIRES SERVING UNDER JEAN DE CARROUGES IN NORMANDY 
WHAT OCCURRED TO ME ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WAS THAT JACQUES LE GRIS HAD CHOSEN ADAM LOUVEL SPECIFICALLY 
BECAUSE OF THAT CLOSE ACQUAINTANCE WITH CARROUGES WHICH IMPLIED AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH MARGUERITE 
LOUVEL MAY HAVE ALERTED LE GRIS THE EVENING BEFORE THE RAPE OF THE IMMINENT DEPARTURE 
OF MARGUERITE'S MOTHER IN LAW TO SAINT PIERRE SUR DIVES 
LE GRIS CLAIMS THAT ON WEDNESDAY THE DAY BEFORE THE ALLEGED CRIME 
HE IS SLEEPING IN EITHER HIS LORD'S BEDROOM OR IN A ROOM OF THE CHATEAU 
AND THEREFORE COULD NOT HAVE RIDDEN THE MILEAGE NECESSARY AND BACK THE FOLLOWING DAY IN ORDER TO COMMIT IT 
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS NOT THERE AT ALL 
DID HE LEAVE AT A LATE HOUR AND TAKE UP LODGINGS WITH ADAM LOUVEL 
NEAR CAPOMESNIL WITHIN EASY DISTANCE OF THE CHATEAU WHERE MARGUERITE WAS 
IT'S ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE HE'S NOT 
BEING OBSERVED DURING THE DAY BY OTHER WITNESSES 
COULD LE GRIS' WITNESSES HAVE GIVEN HIM AN ALIBI FOR THE MORNING HOURS 
IT WAS REGRETTABLY EASY IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY TO FIND PEOPLE 
WHO WERE PREPARED TO SWEAR TO ANY VERSION OF THE FACTS THAT ONE WANTED 
I THINK THAT LE GRIS' ALIBI CLEARLY WAS STRONG ENOUGH 
TO NEED TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BUT IT WAS NOT AT ALL WATERTIGHT 
IT DIDN'T COVER ENOUGH OF THE TIME AND OF COURSE IT DEPENDED 
UPON WITNESSES WHO WERE NOT NECESSARILY THEMSELVES RELIABLE 
HOWEVER LE GRIS ALSO HAD SUPPORT FROM A SURPRISING SOURCE 
THE KNIGHT'S OWN MOTHER NICOLE DE CARROUGES INVESTIGATED THE CLAIM AND FOUND NO TRUTH IN IT 
SHE BEGGED HER SON TO GIVE UP HIS VENDETTA BUT HE REFUSED 
THE SITUATION MADE HER SO SAD AND DISTRAUGHT THAT SOON AFTERWARDS SHE DIED 
LE GRIS LOST A KEY WITNESS BUT STILL MANAGED TO PUT CARROUGES IN A BAD LIGHT 
CARROUGES FORCED MARGUERITE TO FALSELY ACCUSE ME OF HAVING RAPED HER 
ALTHOUGH SHE HADN'T MENTIONED IT IN PREVIOUS DAYS 
HE MADE HIS LIES PUBLIC THROUGH MARGUERITE USING THREATS AND FEAR 
POINTS IN HIS CLIENT'S FAVOUR 
HE ALWAYS SWORE HIS INNOCENCE AND PRAYED TO GOD TO HELP HIM 
IN HIS DIFFICULTY SAYING HIS CAUSE WAS JUST AND HE DID THIS PUBLICLY AT LEAST TWENTY TIMES 
SECONDLY THE COUNT OF ALENCON WROTE A LETTER TO THE KING 
AND TO THE LORDS HIS UNCLES TO SAY THAT LE GRIS WAS INNOCENT 
IN ADDITION MANY KNIGHTS CONFIRMED THAT LE GRIS BEEN WITH THE COUNT 
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY THAT HIS ENEMY SAID THE RAPE HAD OCCURRED 
AND THIRD HIS CO ACCUSED ADAM LOUVEL 
WAS PUT TO THE QUESTION 
TORTURED 
ALONG WITH A MAID SAID TO BE IN CARROUGES' HOUSEHOLD THAT DAY AND NEITHER CONFESSED TO ANYTHING 
AFTER AN EXHAUSTING TWO MONTH HEARING THE PARLIAMENT OF PARIS 
RETIRED TO DECIDE IF THE CASE SHOULD BE RESOLVED BY DUEL TRIAL OR BE ABANDONED 
THERE ARE I SUPPOSE THREE POSSIBILITIES AS TO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED 
ONE IS THAT THE RAPE TOOK PLACE AND WAS COMMITTED BY JACQUES LE GRIS 
ANOTHER IS THAT SHE WASN'T RAPED AT ALL AND MADE THE WHOLE THING UP 
AND THIRD IS THAT SHE WAS RAPED BUT BY SOMEBODY OTHER THAN JACQUES LE GRIS 
NOW IF YOU READ THE COURT TRANSCRIPT CAREFULLY YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ANY LONGER IN 
THE MISTAKEN IDENTITY THEORY BECAUSE MARGUERITE CLAIMS TO HAVE SEEN BOTH MEN IN THE CLEAR LIGHT OF DAY 
SHE CLAIMS TO HAVE SPOKEN TO ADAM LOUVEL AT SOME LENGTH PRIOR TO THE APPEARANCE OF JACQUES LE GRIS 
ADAM LOUVEL NAMES LE GRIS AND THEN LE GRIS HIMSELF APPEARS 
I DON'T SEE HOW READING HER TESTIMONY YOU CAN SAY SHE WAS MISTAKEN 
DID SHE MAKE ALL THAT UP 
WELL OF COURSE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SHE HAD A HYPER FERVID IMAGINATION 
AND NONE OF THIS HAPPENED BUT IF ONE GOES BY SIMPLE THINGS 
LIKE THE LEVEL OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL DETAIL 
THE WEIGHT FALLS IN FAVOUR OF HER ACCOUNT BEING THE TRUTH 
I HAVE CERTAINLY WONDERED AT TIMES ABOUT MARGUERITE'S STORY 
IT WAS PROBABLY FINDING THAT DOCUMENT RELATING TO ADAM LOUVEL THAT SORT OF CLINCHED IT FOR ME THAT 
OH SO ADAM LOUVEL KNEW JEAN DE CARROUGES MAY HAVE KNOWN MARGUERITE 
JACQUES LE GRIS MAY HAVE CHOSEN LOUVEL PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THAT 
IT REALLY MADE ME EVEN MORE CERTAIN 
I THINK MARGUERITE'S STORY IS TRUE AND THAT JACQUES LE GRIS DID ATTACK 
AND RAPE HER AND THAT JEAN DE CARROUGES PURSUED A JUST CAUSE 
THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY TWIST TO MARGUERITE'S STORY THAT WAS NEVER REFERRED TO IN COURT 
IN JEAN LE COQ'S CASEBOOK THERE'S A TANTALISING ENTRY 
HE MENTIONS THE WORDS IN PUERPERIO 
IN PREGNANCY 
CARROUGES' WIFE NEVER WAVERED FROM HER ACCOUNT OF THE RAPE 
REMAINING AS RESOLUTE IN CHILDBIRTH AS ON THE DAY OF THE DUEL 
IT'S AN EXPLOSIVE PIECE OF INFORMATION 
IN FIVE YEARS OF MARRIAGE MARGUERITE HAD NOT HAD A SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY 
COULD SHE HAVE CONCEIVED AFTER BEING RAPED 
THERE'S A VERY COMMONLY HELD BELIEF THAT IT'S ONLY THROUGH ORGASM 
THAT THE SEED AS THEY IMAGINED IT WAS PRODUCED 
SO THEREFORE 
IF YOU'RE RAPED AND YOU DON'T EXPERIENCE PLEASURE 
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CONCEIVE A CHILD 
IT MUST HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE RAPE HAD REALLY OCCURRED ALTHOUGH OF COURSE IN A SITUATION 
WHERE IT'S A MARRIED WOMAN IT WOULD BE EASY TO ARGUE THAT IT MUST SIMPLY BE JEAN DE CARROUGES' CHILD 
NEITHER PARTY CHOSE TO MENTION THE PREGNANCY AT THE HEARING 
AFTER ALL JACQUES LE GRIS DIDN'T WANT TO ARGUE THAT 
HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH HER AND THAT SHE WAS JUST COMPLICIT IN IT 
AND I SUPPOSE THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY WAY THAT HE COULD USE THAT PIECE OF EVIDENCE TO HIS ADVANTAGE REALLY 
IT WOULD NOT HAVE MADE SENSE FOR EITHER CARROUGES OR HIS WIFE TO SUGGEST THAT SHE WAS 
CARRYING THE CHILD OF THE RAPIST SINCE THAT WOULD HAVE UNDERMINED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE CHILD WHEN BORN 
AND THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE INTERESTS OF A MAN WHO WAS CHILDLESS TO DATE 
THE COURT'S DECISION WAS HANDED DOWN ON SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH 
AFTER MUCH DELIBERATION AND ARGUMENT 
THE COURT PRONOUNCED THAT SINCE THE LADY OF CARROUGES COULD NOT PROVE ANYTHING AGAINST JACQUES LE GRIS 
THE MATTER SHOULD BE SETTLED BY A DUEL TO THE DEATH 
WHAT THE PARLIAMENT DECIDED WAS THAT MARGUERITE HAD BEEN RAPED BY SOMEBODY THEY DIDN'T DECIDE WHO 
IT WAS NOT AN OFFENCE WHICH COULD REASONABLY BE PROVED BY WITNESS EVIDENCE 
THEREFORE THEY ORDERED A DUEL 
THE DUEL WAS SET FOR THE END OF NOVEMBER BUT WITH JUST THREE DAYS TO GO THE KING CALLED IT OFF 
HE THEN ABANDONED A PLANNED INVASION OF ENGLAND 
WHEN HE HEARD THE COURT'S DECISION THE KING SAID THAT HE WANTED TO SEE 
THIS DUEL BETWEEN THE KNIGHT AND THE SQUIRE 
THE ROYAL UNCLES WHO ALSO WANTED TO SEE IT TOLD HIM THAT IT WOULD BE QUITE RIGHT FOR HIM TO GO 
SO THE KING SENT ORDERS TO PARIS FOR THE DUEL TO BE POSTPONED 
THE KING WANTED TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE FELT 
CHARLES WAS VERY AWARE OF THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS EVENT 
HE BECAME KING AS A MINOR HIS TWO UNCLES WERE REGENTS 
AND HE SPENT SOME TIME TRYING TO GET OUT FROM UNDER THEIR CONTROL 
HE IS USING SPECTACLE BOTH IN HIS PRESENCE IN THE PARLIAMENT 
AS WELL AS HIS PRESENCE ON THE BATTLEFIELD 
TO SHOW THAT HE IS THE KING AND HE'S DOING WHAT KINGS DO WHICH IS CONTROL JUSTICE 
THE DUEL WAS RESET FOR SATURDAY DECEMBER TWENTY NINTH A PUBLIC HOLIDAY 
CROWDS IN THEIR THOUSANDS ASSEMBLED WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE PARIS PRIORY 
OF SAINT MARTIN DES CHAMPS ON THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THE OLD CITY 
ON ONE SIDE OF THE LISTS BIG STANDS HAD BEEN ERECTED 
FROM WHICH THE LORDS COULD SEE THE FIGHT BETWEEN THE TWO CHAMPIONS 
THE TWO COMBATANTS CAME ONTO THE FIELD ARMED FROM HEAD TO FOOT 
AND EACH OF THEM SAT IN A CHAIR AT OPPOSITE ENDS 
CARROUGES WAS SUFFERING FROM A RECURRING FEVER SO LE GRIS WAS FAVOURITE TO WIN 
ON THE DAY OF THIS DUEL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER DIFFERENT 
FROM WHAT YOU FOUND AT A JOUST OF SPORT WHICH WAS AN ENTERTAINMENT 
THIS WAS A DUEL TO THE DEATH 
THIS WAS A TRIAL BY COMBAT WHERE ONE OF THE TWO MEN WAS MEANT TO DIE AS A RESULT 
AND EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE WAS ARRANGED TO ASSURE THAT ONLY ONE MAN WOULD LEAVE THE FIELD ALIVE 
A GREAT WALL WAS PLACED AROUND THE FIELD 
THE SPECTATORS SAT OR STOOD WELL BEHIND THAT 
GUARDS SURROUNDED THE FIELD TO ENSURE NO INTERFERENCE 
STRICT SILENCE WAS MAINTAINED 
IT WAS A VERY SOLEMN OCCASION 
THE DUEL BEGAN WITH THE SWEARING OF OATHS 
THE THEORY OF THE DUEL IS THAT IT'S A JUDGMENT OF GOD 
BY SWEARING AN OATH YOU ARE PUTTING YOUR CASE BEFORE GOD 
THE IMPLICATION OF COURSE IS ALSO THAT ONE OF THE PARTIES IS COMMITTING PERJURY 
MOST MEDIEVAL PEOPLE BELIEVED GOD CONTROLLED THEIR LIVES 
THEY THOUGHT THAT GOD SUPERVISED THE WORLD FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT 
AND INTERVENED AT ANY MOMENT TO ACHIEVE WHATEVER RESULT HE THOUGHT DESIRABLE 
IF YOU TAKE THAT VIEW OF THE ROLE OF GOD IT'S NOT ALTOGETHER IRRATIONAL TO SUPPOSE 
THAT IF ONE MAN PREVAILS OVER ANOTHER IN A DUEL IT'S BECAUSE GOD CAUSED IT TO HAPPEN 
LE GRIS WAS ALSO KNIGHTED PRIOR TO THE BATTLE 
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO MOUNT A TRIAL BY COMBAT BETWEEN A KNIGHT AND A SQUIRE 
THE EQUALITY AND PARITY OF STATUS WAS ESSENTIAL 
THEN MARGUERITE ARRIVED DRESSED IN BLACK 
THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY SKETCH SHOWS CARROUGES TAKING HIS LEAVE 
LADY ON YOUR EVIDENCE I'M ABOUT TO RISK MY LIFE IN COMBAT WITH JACQUES LE GRIS 
YOU ALONE KNOW IF MY CAUSE IS JUST AND TRUE 
MY LORD SAID THE LADY 
IT IS SO 
YOU MAY FIGHT IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE CAUSE IS JUST 
IN GOD'S HANDS BE IT THEN SAID THE KNIGHT 
HE KISSED HIS WIFE PRESSED HER HAND 
THEN MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS AND ENTERED THE LISTS 
FROISSART'S ACCOUNT RAISED THE STAKES FOR CARROUGES AND HIS WIFE 
HE BELIEVED IF CARROUGES WAS KILLED MARGUERITE'S LIFE MIGHT ALSO BE FORFEIT 
THE LADY PRAYED FERVENTLY TO GOD AND THE VIRGIN MARY ENTREATING THEM TO GRANT HER VICTORY 
FOR IF HER HUSBAND GOT THE WORST OF IT 
THE SENTENCE WAS THAT HE SHOULD BE HANGED AND SHE BURNT WITHOUT APPEAL 
I I DO NOT KNOW 
FOR I NEVER SPOKE TO HER WHETHER SHE REGRETTED GOING SO FAR 
WITH A MATTER WHICH PUT HER AND HER HUSBAND IN SUCH GRAVE DANGER 
BUT FINALLY THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO DO BUT AWAIT THE OUTCOME 
EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF THE DUEL WERE GATHERED BY CHRONICLERS 
LIKE MICHEL PINTOIN BETTER KNOWN AS THE MONK OF SAINT DENIS 
WHEN THE MARSHAL GAVE THE SIGNAL TO ATTACK THEY DROVE THEIR HORSES 
FORWARD LOWERED THEIR LANCES AND COURAGEOUSLY DASHED AGAINST EACH OTHER 
THEIR LANCES HIT EACH OTHER'S STEEL HELMETS SO HARD THAT SPARKS FLEW 
BUT THE LANCES SKIDDED OVER THE METAL AND THE KNIGHTS PASSED EACH OTHER WITHOUT INJURY 
EACH MAN SAW THROUGH HIS VISOR THAT THE OTHER WAS STILL UNHARMED 
SO THEY SPURRED THEIR MOUNTS AND CHARGED AGAIN 
THIS TIME THE FORCE OF THE BLOW SHATTERED THEIR LANCES AND THE SPLINTERS FLEW UP IN THE AIR 
THE HORSES STAGGERED 
CARROUGES WAS UNSEATED FROM HIS HORSE BUT LE GRIS DISMOUNTED TOO 
LE GRIS ATTACKED HIS ENEMY ON FOOT WITH GREAT FEROCITY EVEN THOUGH 
HE WOULD HAVE HAD THE ADVANTAGE IF HE'D STAYED ON HORSEBACK 
THE TWO MEN CIRCLED EACH OTHER THRUSTING SLASHING AND STRIKING 
THE FIRST TO SUFFER WAS CARROUGES TO THE GREAT ALARM OF HIS SPECTATORS 
LE GRIS FOUND AN OPENING AND DROVE HIS SWORD IN WOUNDING THE KNIGHT'S THIGH 
THE SIGHT OF BLOOD SENT A SHIVER THROUGH THE SPECTATORS CARROUGES' SUPPORTERS GASPED 
NOW THE WOUND MIGHT HAVE BEEN FATAL IF LE GRIS HAD KEPT HIS BLADE IN THE WOUND 
BUT THE SQUIRE WITHDREW THE SWORD ALMOST IMMEDIATELY 
THE SPECTATORS WERE PARALYSED 
NO ONE SPOKE OR SEEMED TO BREATHE AS THEY SWUNG BETWEEN HOPE AND FEAR 
BUT CARROUGES FAR FROM BEING VANQUISHED SHOWED MORE ARDOUR FOR THE FIGHT 
HE GATHERED ALL HIS STRENGTH AND ALL HIS COURAGE AND STRODE 
TOWARD HIS ENEMY SHOUTING THIS DAY SHALL DECIDE OUR QUARREL 
HE SEIZED LE GRIS BY THE TOP OF HIS HELMET PULLING HIS ENEMY TOWARD HIM 
THEN TAKING SEVERAL SUDDEN STEPS BACKWARD HE HURLED HIS OPPONENT TO THE GROUND 
LE GRIS LAY SPREAD EAGLED ON HIS BACK PREVENTED FROM GETTING UP BY THE WEIGHT OF HIS OWN ARMOUR 
CARROUGES FORCED UP LE GRIS' VISOR TO FIND A VULNERABLE SPOT 
WITH HIS SWORD POISED HE TAUNTED LE GRIS TO TELL THE WORLD WHAT HE'D DONE 
CONFESS 
CONFESS YOUR CRIME 
LE GRIS CRIED 
IN THE NAME OF GOD AND ON THE PERIL AND DAMNATION OF MY SOUL I AM INNOCENT 
THEN YOU BE DAMNED 
CARROUGES THRUST HIS SWORD IN AND KILLED LE GRIS ON THE SPOT 
AND TURNING SLOWLY HE ASKED THE KING WHETHER HE HAD DONE HIS DUTY 
AND WAS TOLD THAT HE HAD 
CARROUGES WAS THE WINNER AND IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND THE LAW THE INNOCENT PARTY 
LE GRIS' BODY WAS HANGED FROM A PUBLIC GIBBET TO PUNISH HIS PERJURY 
DID THE MEDIEVAL SPECTATORS FEEL THAT JUSTICE HAD BEEN DONE 
I DID WONDER IF IT WAS DIVINE RETRIBUTION 
CARROUGES WAS WEAKENED BY A FEVER HE'D HAD FOR A LONG TIME 
AND LE GRIS APPEARED TO BE THE STRONGER YET HE WAS DEFEATED AS IF BY A MIRACLE 
HOWEVER SOME PEOPLE STILL BELIEVED LE GRIS' OATH THAT HE HADN'T DONE IT 
AS TO HIS CONSCIENCE 
WELL I'LL LEAVE THAT ASIDE 
THE STORY HAS ONE FINAL SURPRISE 
THE MONK OF SAINT DENIS' VERSION OF EVENTS CONCLUDES 
WITH THE STARTLING INFORMATION THAT LE GRIS WAS INNOCENT AFTER ALL 
MANY PEOPLE WHO FELT PITY FOR A LADY WHO'D LOST HER CHASTITY SAID THAT LE GRIS WAS JUSTLY DEFEATED 
BUT AFTERWARDS IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT SOME OTHER SQUIRE HAD COMMITTED THE ASSAULT 
HE CONFESSED WHILE BEING CONDEMNED TO DEATH FOR ANOTHER CRIME 
THE MONK CLAIMED THAT LE GRIS' DEATH WAS A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NEVER PROVEN 
PERHAPS HIS STORY WAS COLOURED BY THE CHURCH'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS DUELS 
THE CHURCH HAS ALWAYS BEEN OPPOSED TO TRIAL BY BATTLE PARTLY ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT SHEDS CHRISTIAN 
BLOOD PARTLY ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT IS WHAT THEY CALL TEMPTING GOD 
THAT IS YOU'RE ASKING GOD TO DECIDE WHEN HUMAN BEINGS SHOULD REALLY 
BE DECIDING BY THEIR OWN NATURAL RATIONAL POWERS 
WE CAN NEVER SOLVE BEYOND ALL DOUBT THE MYSTERY OF CARROUGES VERSUS LE GRIS 
BUT THIS CASE WAS THE BEGINNING 
THIS IS THE LAST CASE OF TRIAL BY BATTLE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE PARLIAMENT OF PARIS 
SO IT IS THE LAST DUEL IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD 
IT'S ALSO AT A TIME WHEN THE DUEL IS BECOMING LESS AND LESS COMMON 
AND IN OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE IT'S FADING OUT AS WELL 
THERE ARE STILL ISOLATED CASES THE LAST CASE IN ENGLAND IS ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
THE LAST CASE IN SCOTLAND IS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS LATER 
TRIAL BY BATTLE WAS REPLACED BY OTHER JUDICIAL PROCESSES 
AND SOME OF THESE FORMS WE'RE HAPPY TO SEE LIKE TRIAL BY JURY 
THE OTHER THING THAT COMES IN AND THIS IS PERHAPS NOT SO WELCOME IS TORTURE 
JUDICIAL TORTURE IS REVIVED IN THE THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH CENTURIES AND IT IS BROUGHT IN EXACTLY FOR THOSE CASES 
FOR WHICH TRIAL BY ORDEAL INCLUDING TRIAL BY BATTLE HAD BEEN USED THE REALLY HARD ONES 
AND WHAT OF MARGUERITE AND JEAN 
THEY WENT ON TO HAVE THREE MALE HEIRS 
FOLLOWING THE DUEL THE KING GAVE CARROUGES A PENSION FOR LIFE 
AND MADE HIM A KNIGHT OF HIS OWN CHAMBER 
SO CARROUGES HAD COMPLETELY REVERSED HIS FORTUNES AND THE KING HAD BROUGHT ANOTHER NOBLE INTO LINE 
CARROUGES WAS ALSO AWARDED DAMAGES FROM LE GRIS' ESTATE 
WHAT HE DID WITH THAT MONEY WAS INTRIGUING 
HE TRIED YET AGAIN TO GAIN THE DISPUTED LAND AT AUNOU LE FAUCON 
WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT CARROUGES ENGINEERED THE RAPE CHARGE AND DUEL 
TO DISPOSE OF HIS RIVAL FOR THE LAND 
THE ONLY THING WE CAN BE SURE OF IS THERE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ROOM 
FOR DOUBT IN THIS CASE SOMETHING LE GRIS' LAWYER KNEW ALL ALONG 
NO ONE REALLY KNEW THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER 
THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE
