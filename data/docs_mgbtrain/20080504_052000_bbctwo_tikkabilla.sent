WITH CABBAGES AND CAULIFLOWER 
WE'VE GOT SOME FRUIT 
SOME PINEAPPLES SOME GRAPES SOME ORANGES AND APPLES AND BANANAS

LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE WE'VE GOT 
A HA THIS LOOKS LIKE AN INTERESTING AND EXCITING SHOP 
IT'S A SWEET SHOP 
WE CAN SEE ALL THESE LOVELY JARS FULL OF BRIGHTLY COLOURED SWEETS 
I'VE GOT ANOTHER SHOP HERE A BAKER'S SHOP 
WHAT A BIG CAKE WITH LOTS OF PINK ICING 
AND GINGERBREAD MEN AND SOME BREAD AND SOME BUNS M. M. M. 
TALL SHOPS SMALL SHOPS ALL AROUND THE TOWN 
LIFTS GOING UP AND LIFTS GOING DOWN 
DOORS SWINGING IN AND OUT 
AND PEOPLE RUSHING ALL ABOUT 
NOW SAMI'S IN A SHOP TODAY 
I THINK HE'S IN A SWEET SHOP LET'S SEE 
THIS IS SAMI 
HE LIVES WITH HIS MUM AND DAD HIS SISTER AND HIS GRANDDAD 
SAMI IS FOUR AND A HALF YEARS OLD 
AND SAMI LOVES TO DAYDREAM 
IT WAS FRIDAY AND SAMI WAS IN HIS FAVOURITE SWEET SHOP 
TRYING TO DECIDE HOW TO SPEND HIS POCKET MONEY 
ALTHOUGH THE SHOP WAS SMALL 
IT WAS STUFFED FROM FLOOR TO CEILING WITH JARS OF SWEETS 
OF EVERY COLOUR AND FLAVOUR IMAGINABLE 
SAMI STOOD AND LOOKED FOR SOME TIME 
WONDERING WHETHER TO GO FOR THE CHOCOLATE BEANS OR THE PEAR DROPS 
OR MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE 
IT WAS DIFFICULT BUT IN THE END HE CHOSE THE CHEWY FRUITY SWEETS 
THE SHOPKEEPER TOOK DOWN A JAR AND BEGAN TO MEASURE OUT THE SWEETS 
THERE WERE HARDLY ANY LEFT 
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT WHILE I GO AND FETCH SOME MORE 
SAID THE SHOPKEEPER 
THAT'S O. K. SAID SAMI 
HE WAS QUITE HAPPY TO STAND AND LOOK AT THE SWEETS 
ALTHOUGH THE SMELL WAS STARTING TO MAKE HIS MOUTH WATER 
ALMOST AS SOON AS THE SHOPKEEPER TURNED HIS BACK 
SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENED 
THERE WERE SQUEAKS AND MURMURS COMING FROM THE JARS 
ALMOST AS IF THE SWEETS WERE ALIVE AND MOVING 
UP ON THE SHELVES THE NOISES GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER 
AND ONE OF THE JARS BEGAN TO WOBBLE UNCONTROLLABLY 
SAMI WAS AFRAID IT MIGHT FALL AND BREAK 
WHEN THE LID SUDDENLY FLEW OFF 
AND MARSHMALLOWS EXPLODED ACROSS THE SHOP 
THEY BEGAN TO BOUNCE OFF THE WALLS AND CEILINGS 
SHOUTING WHEE AS THEY WENT 
SAMI WAS WONDERING WHAT TO DO 
WHEN HE HEARD A FAINT WHISTLING SOUND FROM A SHELF ABOVE HIS HEAD 
IT WAS QUITE DARK IN THE SHOP 
AND SAMI COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS MAKING THE NOISE 
UNTIL IT LANDED ON THE COUNTER IN FRONT OF HIM 
IT BOUNCED A FEW TIMES AND SKIDDED ALONG THE WORKTOP 
BEFORE CRASHING TO A HALT BY THE LIQUORICE BOOTLACES 
SAMI PEERED OVER THE EDGE OF THE COUNTER TO SEE WHAT IT WAS 
WHAT HE SAW WAS A LITTLE MAN MADE ENTIRELY FROM SWEETS 
SITTING ON A SHERBET FLYING SAUCER 
COME ON HELP ME HE CALLED TO SAMI 
WHO WAS TRYING TO AVOID BEING HIT 
WE'VE GOT TO GET THEM BACK IN THE JAR BEFORE THEY BREAK SOMETHING 
HE GRABBED A PASSING MARSHMALLOW FLEW UP TO THE SHELF 
AND DROPPED IT INTO THE TOP OF THE JAR 
BUT NO SOONER HAD HE LET GO THAN IT JUMPED OUT AGAIN 
AND WAS BACK FLYING AROUND WITH HIS FRIENDS 
SAMI GRABBED A HANDFUL AS THEY WHIZZED PAST 
HE STUFFED THEM INTO THE JAR AND PUT THE LID ON SO THEY COULDN'T GET OUT 
THE SWEET MAN FLEW BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS SO FAST 
THAT ALL SAMI COULD SEE WAS A PINK BLUR 
HE GRABBED THE MISCHIEVOUS MARSHMALLOWS ONE BY ONE 
AND DROPPED THEM INTO THE JAR 
BUT AS FAST AS HE WORKED 
THERE STILL SEEMED TO BE HUNDREDS MORE BOUNCING ALL OVER THE SHOP 
THEN IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL THE SHOPKEEPER REAPPEARED 
THE MARSHMALLOWS FROZE IN MIDAIR 
RIGHT HERE WE ARE HE SAID 
AND WENT BACK TO WEIGHING OUT THE FRUITY CHEWS 
LUCKILY THE SHOPKEEPER HAD FORGOTTEN TO PUT HIS GLASSES ON 
AND WAS TOO BUSY SQUINTING AT THE SCALES 
TO NOTICE THE MARSHMALLOWS AS THEY FLEW INTO THE JAR 
SAMI PUT THE LID ON AND SLID THEM ONTO THE SHELF 
THE SWEET MAN ON HIS FLYING SAUCER DOFFED HIS CAP 
AND DUCKED BEHIND A JAR AND THE SHOPKEEPER DIDN'T SEE A THING 
SAMI BOUGHT HIS SWEETS AND SAID GOODBYE 
OUTSIDE WHILE HE WALKED UP THE STREET 
HE FELT SOMETHING MOVING IN HIS POCKET 
HE REACHED IN AND PULLED OUT A MARSHMALLOW 
IT BOUNCED UP AND DOWN IN HIS HAND A FEW TIMES SQUEAKING 
THEN HOPPED OFF BACK TO THE SHOP 
COME ON SAMI CALLED HIS MOTHER STOP DAYDREAMING 
SAMI POPPED A FRUITY CHEW IN HIS MOUTH AND RAN TO MEET HER 
HE WASN'T SO SURE THAT HE HAD BEEN DAYDREAMING 
SAMI HAD GREAT FUN IN THE SWEET SHOP 
AND WEREN'T THOSE MARSHMALLOWS BOUNCY 
I'M GONNA MAKE SOMETHING USING MARSHMALLOWS A MARSHMALLOW SMILE 
WHAT I'VE GOT HERE ARE SOME APPLE SOME MARSHMALLOWS 
I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME PIECES OF APPLE 
LIKE THAT 
AND SOME MARSHMALLOWS 
I WONDER IF YOU CAN GUESS WHAT THESE ARE GOING TO BE 
CAN YOU GUESS 
IF I PUT THE MARSHMALLOWS DOWN LIKE THAT 
WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE 
DO THEY REMIND YOU OF ANYTHING 
THEY'RE TEETH AREN'T THEY AREN'T THEY FANTASTIC 
I'LL PUT THAT TO ONE SIDE AND I'M GOING TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE

ON TOP OF THE APPLE LIKE THAT 
ANOTHER SLICE OF APPLE ON TOP OF THE CHEESE CUBES 
LOOK AT THOSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T BRUSH YOUR TEETH

I THINK I'M GOING TO MAKE A FACE 
I'VE GOT A PAPER PLATE HERE A NICE PEACHY COLOUR 
AND I'VE GOT SOME DRIED FRUIT OVER HERE
