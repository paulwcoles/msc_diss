THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO SHE HAS A RIGHT TO CONFIDENTIALITY 
I KNOW BUT SOMETIMES COMMON SENSE IS BETTER THAN ALL THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS 
RULES AND REGULATIONS ARE THERE FOR A REASON TO PROTECT PEOPLE

WHAT'S THE WORST THEY CAN DO 
WE DON'T KNOW AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO STAND UP TO PEOPLE 
SHE SHOULD TELL THEM THEY CAN'T RUN HER LIFE 
MUTUAL RESPECT THAT'S WHAT A RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE BASED ON 
IN AN IDEAL WORLD YEAH 
IT'S UP TO HER RUTH 
HOW CAN SHE DECIDE WHEN SHE DOESN'T KNOW HE'S HERE LOOKING FOR HER 
IF SHE THINKS HER PARENTS ARE STILL ANGRY AND SHE'S TOO SCARED TO GET IN TOUCH WELL 
YOU THINK IF SHE KNOWS HER FATHER'S HERE AND THAT THEY MISS HER EXACTLY
