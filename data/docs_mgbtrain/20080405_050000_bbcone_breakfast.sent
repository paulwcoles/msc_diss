IT ON 
GOOD MORNING ALSO ON THE PROGRAMME 
BRITISH AIRWAYS SAYS IT HOPES TO 
RUN A NORMAL SERVICE FROM HEATHROW 
TERMINAL FIVE TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE IT OPENED 
ARE THE LATEST PARKING CONTROLS 
CURLING OUR HIGH STREETS 
SHOPKEEPERS ARE OPPOSED AND UPSET 
ABOUT IT 
IT IS VERY BAD YOU ARE 
BETTER OFF IN THE SUPERMARKET 
PRINCE PHILIP SPENDS SECOND NIGHT 
IN HOSPITAL RECEIVING TREATMENT FOR 
A CHEST INFECTION 
IN THE SPORT IT IS GRAND NATIONAL 
DAY BUT WHO WILL BE THE HORSE FOR 
THE AINTREE COURSE 
GET READY TO GET BACK BEHIND THE 
SOFA WE CELEBRATE THE RETURN OF DOCTOR 
WHO WITH A FEW OF OUR FAVOURITE 
MONSTERS MONSTERS ZIMBABWE'S BIGGEST OPPOSITION PARTY 
IS GOING TO COURT THIS MORNING TO 
TRY TO FORCE THE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION TO RELEASE THE RESULTS 
OF LAST SATURDAY'S PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION THE MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IS CONVINCED ITS 
CANDIDATE MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS 
WON BUT ROBERT MUGABE'S ZANU P. F. 
PARTY SAYS THEY WILL BACK HIM IN 
ANY OUTCOME 
ZIMBABWE IS A NATION IN WAITING 
THERE IS NO SIGN OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL RESULT BEING MADE 
PUBLIC AND THE M. D. C. IS LOSING 
PATIENCE THEY INTEND TO SEEK A 
COURT ORDER TO FORCE THE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION TO PUBLISH THE RESULTS 
OF THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE IF THEY 
SUCCEED THE RESULTS COULD BE 
PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE BY THIS AFTERNOON 
BUT THERE IS NO TELLING WHAT THE 
REACTION WILL BE POLICE HAVE BEEN 
DEPLOYED ON THE STREETS AND RUMOURS 
OF RAIDS AND ARRESTS ARE DOING 
LITTLE TO QUELL RISING TENSIONS 
THE M. D. C. BELIEVES MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
HAS WON THE VOTE AND ENDED 
PRESIDENT MUGABE'S TWENTY EIGHT YEAR REIGN 
BUT MR. MUGABE'S ZANU P. F. PARTY HAS 
WARNED AGAINST EARLY VICTORY HIS 
SUPPORTERS HAVE PLEDGED THEIR 
SUPPORT IF THERE IS A SECOND ROUND 
RUN OFF 
BRITISH AIRWAYS SAYS IT HOPES TO 
RUN A NORMAL SCHEDULED FROM 
TERMINAL FIVE TODAY SINCE THE FIRST 
TIME IT OPENED HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS 
WERE CANCELLED AFTER PROBLEMS WITH 
BAGGAGE HANDLING SYSTEMS ARE LED TO 
A BACKLOG OF THOUSANDS CODPIECES OF 
LUGGAGE THE PROBLEMS ARE THOUGHT 
TO HAVE COST THEM AROUND SIXTY 
MILLION MILLION THESE ARE THE SCENES BRITISH 
AIRWAYS' HOPES NEVER TO SEE AGAIN 
AN OPENING THAT TURNED TO ANGER 
THE DESKS ARE CLOSED IT IS 
INCREDIBLE 
WHEN THE BAGGAGE SYSTEM INCREDIBLE FAILED FLIGHTS WERE CANCELLED BY 
THE DOZEN HOW MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED WERE 
GROUNDED IN THE FIRST NINE DAYS AND 
THIS IS WHY BEHIND THE SCENES A 
BAGGAGE BACKLOG ON A HUGE SCALE 
THOUSANDS OF LUGGAGE IS WAITING TO 
BE SORTED AND RETURNED TO THEIR 
OWNERS BUT BRITISH AIRWAYS SAYS 
TERMINAL FIVE IS READY TO TAKE ON THE 
WORKLOAD TODAY THAT MEANS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE 
FLIGHTS BUT SCHEDULES ARE LIGHTER 
AT THE WEEKENDS AND THE TERMINAL IS 
RUNNING AT NOTHING LIKE FULL 
CAPACITY 
IT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT CAPACITY WEEK FOR BRITISH AIRWAYS BUT IF 
THIS WEEKEND GOES WELL NEXT WEEK 
THEY WILL BE MOVING TOWARDS A MORE 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OPERATIONS THAT WAY THEY 
WOULD BUILD CONFIDENCE DAY BY DAY 
AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL LOOK 
FORWARD TO THE TRANSFER OF FLIGHT 
FROM TERMINAL FOUR WITH GREATER 
CONFIDENCE 
THERE HAS BEEN SCENES CONFIDENCE OF TERMINAL FIVE BUT ONLY AFTER 
CANCELLATIONS EASED THE STRAIN IF 
ALL GOES WELL TODAY BRITISH 
AIRWAYS' HOPES OF RUNNING A 
CONSISTENT FULL SERVICE MIGHT 
START TO LOOK MORE LIKE A REALITY 
CONTROLLED PARKING ZONES COULD BE 
PUT IN LOCAL SHOPS OUT OF BUSINESS 
AND DESTROYING WHAT IS LEFT OF THE 
HIGH STREET THAT AND THE VIEW OF 
THE FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES 
WHICH SAYS THE SPREAD OF THE 
PARKING RESTRICTIONS ORIGINALLY 
MEANT TO PROTECT RESIDENTS PARKING 
AND FREE UP SPACES FOR SHOPPERS ARE 
CAUSING MORE PROBLEMS 
ON THE BEAT THIS IS HELPING SMALL 
BUSINESSES ACCORDING TO WEST 
SUSSEX COUNCIL FOR LOCAL 
BUSINESSES CLAIM THAT CONTROLLED 
PARKING ZONE DESIGNED TO PROTECT 
RESIDENTS PARKING AND FREE OF 
SPACES FOR SHOPPERS IS DESTROYING 
TRADE AND ZAPPING THE LIFE OUT OF 
THEIR TOWN THERE ARE AROUND SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
CONTROLLED PARKING ZONES IN TOWNS CREATED EVERY MONTH BUT WITH 
AROUND FORTY SMALL INDEPENDENT 
BUSINESSES A WEEK GOING BUST MANY 
FEAR THEY ARE THE FINAL NAIL IN THE 
COFFIN 
WE THINK THE CONTROLLED COFFIN PARKING ZONES OF THE DEATH KNELL 
FOR SMALL INDEPENDENT SHOPS ON THE 
HIGH STREET AS MORE AND MORE 
PARKING RESTRICTIONS ARE PUT IN 
PLACE IN TOWN CENTRES MORE 
INDEPENDENT SHOPS GO OUT OF 
BUSINESS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND A YEAR AT THE 
SAME TIME THERE ARE NO PARKING 
RESTRICTIONS FOR BIG SUPERMARKETS 
AND RETAIL CHAINS ON THE OUTSIDE OF 
TOWNS AND THEY ARE ABLE TO OFFER 
ALMOST LIMITLESS FREE PARKING 
THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO INCREASE THE 
TURNOVER OF SHOPPERS AND BOOST 
TRADE BUT STRICT ENFORCEMENT MEAN 
THEY CAN HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT 
LOCAL BUSINESSES SAY THIS IS THE 
PROBLEM I WANT TO GO TO SOME OF 
THE SHOPS BUT BECAUSE OF THE 
CONTROLLED PARKING ZONE IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO PARK THEY SAY THIS IS 
DRIVING PEOPLE AWAY FROM THEIR 
STORES INTO OUT OF TOWN SHOPPING 
CENTRES 
A LOT OF CUSTOMERS ARE NOT CENTRES CUTTING INTO THE TOWN AS FREQUENTLY 
AS THEY USED TO SO THEY ARE NOT 
BROWSING SHOPS THEY ARE STRESSED 
LOOKING AT THEIR WATCH AND THEY 
ARE NOT CONCENTRATING THEY ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT GETTING BACK TO THEIR 
CARS 
IN CITIES THEY ARE CAUSING CARS SIMILAR PROBLEMS 
IT IS A BIT OF A 
BLUNT INSTRUMENT AND I KNOW A LOT 
OF THE SHOPKEEPERS ARE OPPOSED TO 
IT AND UPSET ABOUT IT 
IT IS BAD 
PARKING YOU ARE BETTER OFF IN A 
SUPERMARKET 
BUT COUNCILS SAY SUPERMARKET PARKING ZONES OF MEAN TOWNS ARE NOT 
CLOGGED UP WITH LONG TERM PARKING 
AND ALLOW MORE PEOPLE TO ACCESS THE 
SHOPS 
MY CONCERN IS THE SMALL SHOPS BUSINESSES AND I WANT TO ENSURE 
THEY SURVIVE L. WILL DO EVERYTHING 
I CAN TO HELP THEM BY PUTTING 
SHORT TERM PARKING OUTSIDE THE 
SHOPS INNOCENT OF OUR TOWNS SO YOU 
HAVE A TURNOVER ALL THE TIME AND 
PEOPLE COME HERE THEY WILL 
CONTINUE TO COME TO DO THEIR 
SHOPPING 
THIS WEEK THE GOVERNMENT SHOPPING ISSUED GUIDELINES THAT WARNED 
COUNCILS CONTROL PARKING ZONES 
SHOULD ONLY BE USED IN A SMALL AREA 
IN TOWN CENTRES BUT INDEPENDENT 
BUSINESSES ARE WORRIED THAT AS THEY 
SPREAD THEY ARE HELPING TO DRIVE 
THEM OUT OF BUSINESS 
GET IN TOUCH WITH US IF YOU HAVE 
ANY VIEWS ABOUT THAT IS IT KILLING 
OUR HIGH STREETS WE WILL BE 
TALKING TO THE R. A. C. FOUNDATION ABOUT 
THAT STORY 
THREE MEN WILL APPEAR IN COURT 
TODAY CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY TO 
SUPPLY MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION WORTH 
OF HEROIN THE MEN TWO FROM EAST 
LONDON AND ONE FROM THE NETHERLANDS 
WERE DETAINED AFTER DETECTIVES 
SEIZED HEROIN FROM CARS AT A 
SERVICE STATION ON THE M. TWENTY IN KENT 
GORDON BROWN HOSTS TWENTY WORLD LEADERS

GOVERNANCE HE SAYS HE HOPES THE 
CONFERENCE WHICH IS BEING HELD THE 
WATFORD WILL TACKLE WHAT HE 
DESCRIBES AS THE FIRST TRULY 
GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS OF THE 
MODERN WORLD HE PROMISED TO WORK 
TOWARDS A GLOBAL NEW DEAL TO HELP 
THE POOREST NATIONS 
WE SHOULD AS THE RICHEST COUNTRIES 
IN THE WORLD OF SPONSOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM 
TO EVERY CHILD HAS THE RIGHT TO 
EDUCATION WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS 
SO WE PROVIDE THE HEALTHCARE 
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CAPACITY TO 
ENABLE PEOPLE TO ESCAPE FROM 
AVOIDABLE DISEASES WHERE WE KNOW WE 
HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICAL 
EQUIPMENT AND WE KNOW WE HAVE THE 
SIGNS SCIENCE TO ENABLE LIVES TO 
BE SAFE 
THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH HAS SPENT A 
SECOND NIGHT IN HOSPITAL WHERE HE 
IS BEING TREATED FOR A CHEST INSECT 
CHEST INFECTION PRINCE PHILIP 
WHO IS EIGHTY SIX WERE SUFFERING FROM A 
HEAVY COLD AND HAS CANCELLED HIS 
DIARY ENGAGEMENTS THIS WEEKEND HOW 
IS PRINCE PHILIP 
GOOD MORNING NO NEWS FROM

THE WEEK THE FIRST SIGNS ALL WAS 
NOT WELL WITH THE PRINCE FIRST CAME

SERVICE FOR SIR EDMUND HILLARY THE 
CONQUEROR OF EVEREST AT SAINT GEORGE'S 
CHAPEL IN WINDSOR AND THAT WAS THE 
FIRST TIME WE NOTICED HE WAS NOT 
WELL HE HAS CANCELLED A FEW 
ENGAGEMENTS BUT BUCKINGHAM PALACE 
ARE KEEN TO STRESS THEY DON'T 
BELIEVE IT TO SERIOUS AND HIS 
ENGAGEMENTS FOR NEXT WEEK ARE STILL 
ON 
HE IS EIGHTY SIX WHAT DO WE KNOW OF ON HIS RECENT HEALTH 
I DID NOT QUITE CATCH THE QUESTION 
BUT IF YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT HIS 
RECENT HEALTH FOR A MAN OF HIS AGE 
HE IS FIT AND HEALTHY HE WAS 
PLAYING POLO IN HIS FIFTIES AND TAKING 
PART IN DANGEROUS SPORT OF 
CARRIAGE DRIVING INTO HIS SEVENTIES 
SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY WE ARE 
SURPRISED HE HAS SPENT SECOND 
NIGHT IN HOSPITAL BUT WE ARE 
HOPING FOR SOME WORD FROM 
BUCKINGHAM PALACE BUT AS FAR AS 
EVERYONE IS CONCERNED SECOND 
NIGHT SPENT VERY REST FULLY HERE IN 
HOSPITAL HOSPITAL TWO WOMEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE ALLEGED ABDUCTION OF 
SHANNON MATTHEWS HAVE BEEN RELEASED 
ON BAIL THE WOMEN WHO ARE THE 
MOTHER AND SISTER OF HER STEPFATHER 
CRAIG MEEHAN HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED 
ON SUSPICION OF ASSISTING AN 
OFFENDER AND ATTEMPTING TO PERVERT 
THE COURSE OF JUSTICE HIS UNCLE 
MICHAEL DONOVAN HAS BEEN CHARGED 
WITH KIDNAPPING THE GIRL WHO WERE 
MISSING FOR MORE THAN THREE WEEKS 
IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH 
AT THE OLYMPIC TORCH WILL PASS 
THROUGH LONDON THIS WEEKEND AS IT 
CONTINUES AND A JOURNEY FROM GREECE 
TO THE BEIJING TWO THOUSAND EIGHT GAMES BUT 
ACTIVISTS CRITICAL OF THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT ARE PLANNING TO STAGE 
SEVERAL DEMONSTRATIONS ALONG THE 
ROUTE AT THE OLYMPICS AND THE FOUR 
MONTHS AWAY OUR SPORTS EDITOR 
LOOKS AT HOW THE PROTESTS FINCH 
CHINA HAVING ON THE OLYMPIC BRAND 
WEMBLEY WAS MEANT TO SEE AN OLYMPIC 
CELEBRATION TOMORROW INSTEAD IT 
WILL MALCOLM MOST THE MOST 
CONTROVERSIAL TORCH RELAY SINCE THE 
WAR ON PROTEST OFF CHINA'S HUMAN 
RIGHTS RECORD 
THE RELAY IS RELATIVELY NEW IT WAS 
STARTED BY A NAZI GERMANY FOR THE 
NINETEEN THIRTY SIX OLYMPICS AS A MEANS OF 
PROMOTING HITLER'S REGIME TODAY IT 
IS MEANT TO PROMOTE PEACE HARMONY 
AND UNDERSTANDING ORGANISERS HOPE 
THIS MESSAGE WILL COME THROUGH THIS 
WEEKEND 
I THINK IT IS WRONG TO WEEKEND ATTRIBUTE ANY MOTIVE OTHER THAN THE 
WISH THAT THE TORCH RELAY IS A 
SUCCESS ON ITS LONDON LEG PASSES 
OFF PEACEFULLY 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN THE 
TORCH CAME TO THE CITY LONDON WAS 
BIDDING FOR THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE GAMES AND A 
RELAY SERVE TO IGNITE THE 
ENTHUSIASM THIS TIME THE EFFECT 
MAY NOT BE SO POSITIVE 
THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES AND THE TORCH IS MEANT TO 
CONVEY HARMONY AND PROGRESS AND 
GOOD THINGS ABOUT SPORT THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES IF THEY ARE GOING TO 
BECOME ANOTHER POLITICAL 
OPPORTUNITY THE BRAND IS TAINTED 
BY THE TIME THE TORCH ENDS ITS 
JOURNEY ACROSS LONDON BOTH LONDON 
AND BEIJING WILL HOPE THE OLYMPIC 
IDEALS OF THE RELATE WAS MEANT TO 
PROMOTE HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETELY 
FORGOTTEN RELAY 
TOP STORIES STILL TO COME WE 
WILL TAKE A LOOK BACK AT THE 
MOMENTS FROM THE WEEK'S NEWS 
NOW IT HAS HAPPENED TO MOST CAR 
OWNERS AT SOME POINT JUST POPPING 
DOWN TO THE LOCAL HIGH STREET YOU 
CANNOT FIND ANYWHERE TO PARK WHEN 
YOU DO FIND SPACE YOU FIND IT YOU PAY FOR A SET PERIOD AND THEN 
RUSH OFF TO THE SHOPS THE 
FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE 
SAYING THAT PARKING RULES ARE 
KILLING OFF SMALL BUSINESSES LET'S 
TALK ABOUT THIS WITH SHEILA 
GRAINGER FROM THE R. A. C. GOOD MORNING 
IT IS A DIFFICULT BALANCE ISN'T IT 
IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE PARKING FOR 
HOURS PEOPLE CANNOT JUST NIP INTO 
THE SHOPS BUT IF YOU CANNOT PARK 
ANYWHERE YOU CANNOT SHOP EITHER 
WHAT IS THE ANSWER 
IT IS GETTING 
THAT BALANCE VERY OFTEN THERE IS 
COMPETITION FOR SPACES FROM 
RESIDENTS COMMUTERS AND SHOPPERS 
WE HAVE POLLED MOTORISTS AND ONE IN 
THREE SAID THEY HAVE GIVEN UP A 
SHOPPING TRIP BECAUSE THEY CANNOT 
PARK SO IT IS VITAL TO THE SUCCESS 
OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES 
WHAT IS 
THE IDEAL AMOUNT OF TIME SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO PARK IS IT ONE HOUR SO YOU 
GET LOTS OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO 
PARK OR IS IT LONGER THAN THAT SO 
YOU CAN DO A GOOD DEAL OF SHOPPING 
PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO LOCAL 
BUSINESSES 
IT DEPENDS ON THE TOWN BUSINESSES CENTRE AND WHAT KIND OF SHOPS OF 
HER COUNCILS HAVE GOT TO TALK TO 
THE BUSINESSES VERY OFTEN THEY 
WILL TALK TO THE RESIDENCE BECAUSE 
THEY ARE THE VOTERS BUT THEY DON'T 
TALK TO THE RETAILERS AND ASK WHAT 
THEY NEED IN SOME PLACES YOU GET 
THIRTY MINUTES' FREE PARKING IT IS 
CALLED STOP AND SHOP AND THAT IS 
GREAT FOR A PINT OF MILK OTHER 
PEOPLE ARE COMING TO COMPARE 
HOUSEHOLD GOODS FOR A LOOK ROUND 
THE SHOPS FOR CLOTHES OR SHOES DO DO YOU THINK THEY MIGHT BE AN ARGUMENT 
THAT THIS IS A BALANCE THAT CANNOT 
BE REACHED IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF 
SMALL SHOPS IN AN AREA WHICH IS 
HIGHLY RESIDENTIAL AND RESIDENTS 
NEED TO PARK THEN YOU CANNOT REACH 
AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN SMALL 
BUSINESSES AND THE RESIDENTS AND 
SOMEONE HAS TO WIN OUT IT IS GOING 
TO BE THE RESIDENTS' PARKING 
IT IS 
ALWAYS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND FOR 
THE COUNCILS IT IS CONSOLS CONSULT 
CONSULT WE OFTEN SEE THE COUNCIL 
PUTTING IN A CONTROLLED PARKING 
ZONE AND INSISTS EVERYTHING IN THE 
GARDEN IS ROSY IN FACT SHOPKEEPERS 
SEE THEIR TURNOVER PLUMMETS IT IS 
THE ATTITUDE TO ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE 
WILL COME TO THE TOWN FOR THE FIRST 
TIME GET A PARKING TICKET AND THEN 
THEY WILL GO SOME WERE ELSE WHAT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAY 
ACTUALLY IN THIS AGE OF 
ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS IT IS TIME 
WE STOPPED USING CARS FOR SHOPPING 
AND WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO WALK 
AND DO MORE SHOPPING THAT WAY THAT THAT WILL HELP IT IS PART OF THE 
BALANCE PARK AND RIDE CAN BE 
FANTASTIC BUT THE CAR REMAINS THE 
SHOPPING TROLLEY OF CHOICE FOR 
THINGS LIKE GROCERIES WHITE GOODS 
THERE IS OFTEN NO ALTERNATIVE WE WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS 
THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME WE WOULD 
LIKE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS THE 
WAYS OF GETTING IN TOUCH ARE ON THE 
SCREEN WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO 
SOMEONE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
PARKING RESTRICTIONS LATER ON 
TIME TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS 
THIS MORNING 
LET'S START WITH THE GUARDIAN NEW 
CLASHES ON TIBET ON THE EVE OF THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH'S ARRIVAL IN THE U. K. 
THERE'S A NEW SERIES OF VIOLENT 
CLASHES IN CHINA THREATENING TO 
AGGRAVATE PROTESTS WHICH MIGHT 
GREET THE LONDON LEG IT PASSES 
THROUGH THE CAPITAL THIS WEEKEND 
THE DAILY MAIL THIS MORNING HAS A 
PHOTOGRAPH OF PRINCE PHILIP HE

GOES TO COURT TO FORCE OFFICIALS TO 
RELEASE THANKS WEEK'S ELECTION 
RESULTS BRITISH AIRWAYS SAYS IT 
EXPECTS THE TERMINAL FIVE T. O. R. WORKING 
NORMALLY THIS WEEKEND STILL TO 
COME A BRIGHT IDEA COULD FITTING 
A SOLAR PANEL LIGHTEN THE LOAD ON 
YOUR WALLET RAISE 
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE LOOKING AT SNOW 
THIS WEEKEND AFTER A WEEK OF 
SPRING SUNSHINE WINTER WILL BITE 
BACK THIS WEEKEND A WEATHER WATCH 
WE HAVE OUT AT THE MOMENT FOR SNOW 
AND ICE ALMOST ANYWHERE ACROSS THE 
U. K. ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AND NEXT 
WEEK ALREADY NINE HUNDRED THE SHOWERS 
TURNING WINTRY PARTICULARLY ACROSS 
THE HIGHER GROUND AND LOWER LEVELS 
COLD WIND THE FURTHER NORTH YOU 
HAPPEN TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN 
AND HILL SNOW THIS MORNING COLDER 
AIR WILL START TO FOLLOW ON BEHIND 
STILL TO THE SOUTH OF THE RAIN IT 
IS A REASONABLY MILD START TO THE 
DAY NINE DEGREES IN LONDON AND NOT 
FEELING TOO BAD WITH LIGHT WINDS 
AND SPELLS OF SUNSHINE 
IT IS A BRIGHT START ACROSS DEVON 
A GOOD DAY ACROSS WALES AS WELL 
BUT ALREADY COLDER AIR FLOODING 
INTO NORTHERN IRELAND THIS MORNING 
A FEW SHOWERS AND STARTING 
TEMPERATURE OF FOUR DEGREES IN 
BELFAST THROUGH THE DAY THIS AREA 
OF RAIN THERE SINK SOUTHWARDS AND 
BREAK UP INTO SHOWERS AFFECTING 
EASTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND SOUTH 
WEST WILL STAY DRY BUT SHOWERS 
FURTHER NORTH READILY TURNING TO 
SLEET AND SNOW AS THE DAY GOES ON 
IT WILL FEEL COLD PARTICULARLY IN 
THE STRONG WINDS OF THE NORTH OF 
SCOTLAND FOR THE GRAND NATIONAL 
THIS AFTERNOON INCREASING LISK OF 
SEEING SHOWERS AS THE AFTERNOON 
GOES ON OR ALL THE COVERAGE 
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON WINTRY 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE U. K. SOMETHING 
MORE SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPS ACROSS 
WALES MIDLANDS AND CENTRAL PARTS 
OF ENGLAND YOU COULD SEE TEN CM OF 
SNOW AND TEMPERATURES WILL FALL 
AWAY MINUS ONE AND MINUS TWO 
CELSIUS SMOOFPLT SO A COLD START 
TOMORROW POTENTIALLY ICE IN PLACES 
MAYBE SNOW FIRST THING ACROSS 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF 
ENGLAND FURTHER WINTRY SHOWERS 
WILL FOLLOW AS THE DAY GOES ON 
MORE SIGNIFICANT SNOW IS POSSIBLE 
FOR EASTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND IT 
CERTAINLY WILL FEEL COLD SINGLE 
FIGURES FIVE TO EIGHT DEGREES BUT FEELING 
COLDER POTENTIALLY ICE ON MONDAY 
MORNING WINTRY SHOWERS HEAVIEST 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE U. K. 
FEELING COLD SEVEN TO NINE DEGREES WINTER 
BITES BACK THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND 
THANK YOU IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR 
WHEN A LOT OF SCHOOLS HAVE BROKEN 
UP FOR THE SPRING BREAK WITH THE 
PRICE OF GAS AND ELECTRICITY 
SOARING HOMEOWNERS HAVE TURNED TO 
SOLAR POWER TO HELP CUT THE COST OF 
THEIR ENERGY BILLS THE GOVERNMENT 
ARE ENCOURAGING MORE OF US TO GO 
GREEN AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO HAVE 
PLANNING PERMISSION TO HAVE SOLAR 
PANELS BUT CAMPAIGNERS SAY THE 
GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO CUT GRANTS 
IS PUTTING PEOPLE OFF EVERY YEAR 
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND HOMEOWNERS TURN TO THE SUN 
TO PROVIDE POWER FOR THEIR HOMES 
IT'S PART OF A GREENER WAY OF LIFE 
THE GOVERNMENT'S ENCOURAGING TOWS 
LIVE WITH ENERGY PRICE S. O. S. HIGH 
IT SOUNDS LIKE A SHRUEED FINANCIAL 
MOVE BUT DOT FIGURES STACK UP 
SIMON HAD SOAP LATER HOT WATER 
PANELS INSTALLED FIVE YEARS AGO HE 
HAS PANELS TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY 
FOR HIS HOME AND HE IS SAVING MONEY 
ON HIS BILLS ON THE THERMAL I 
WOULD SAY I SAVE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND 
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY A YEAR BUT I'M ON OIL I 
THINK I WOULDN'T GET A SAVING IF I 
WAS ON GAS WHICH MEANS I'LL PAY 
BACK WITHIN TEN YEARS SIMON'S 
PAYBACK ISN'T TYPICAL SOME 
CONSUMERS COULD WAIT FOR UP TO TWENTY 
YEARS BUT SOLAR PANELS LAST TWENTY 
YEARS SO THAT COULD WRITE OFF ANY 
POTENTIAL SAVINGS 
ARCHITECTS WHO SPECIAL SIZE IN 
SUSTAINABLE HOUSING SAY THE 
GOVERNMENT ISN'T DOING ANYWHERE 
NEAR ENOUGH TO HELP PEOPLE WHO WANT 
TO GO GREEN 
I THINK THE 
GOVERNMENT'S INCENTIVE ARE TOTALLY 
INADEQUATE FRANKLY PATHETIC AND 
DO VERY LITTLE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE 
TO INVEST IN THIS SORT OF 
TECHNOLOGY PEOPLE DO IT MOSTLY 
AT PRESENT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE 
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO RATHER 
THAN ANY FINANCIAL INCENTIVE THE THE GOVERNMENT'S RELAXED THE PLANNING 
LAWS BUT GREEN GROUPS SAY WHAT 
THEY SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON IS 
INCREASING THE GRANTS AVAILABLE AT 
THE MOMENT THE MAXIMUM YOU CAN GET 
TOWARDS THE COST OF SOLAR HOT WATER 
PANELS IS FOUR HUNDRED THAT COMPARES TO A 
MINIMUM OUTLAY OF THREE THOUSAND THE 
PAYBACK TIME IS ANYTHING BETWEEN 
TEN TO TWENTY YEARS GREEN GROUPS SAY WITH 
SUCH LONG PAYBACK TIME THERE'S NOT 
ENOUGH INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO GO 
SOLAR THEY WANT AN INCREASE ON THE 
CURRENT FOUR HUNDRED GRANT 
WE WANT THE 
GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE THE GRANT 
LEVEL TO SOLAR PANELS TO UP TO 
FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND WE'D LIKE THE GOVERNMENT 
FOR SOLAR ELECTRICITY TO INCREASE 
THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THEY OFFER FROM 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
THAT WOULD CUT 
THE PACK YAIBACK TIME TO A FEW 
YEARS THERE'S NO SIGN FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT MORE MONEY IS ON OFFER 
WE HAVE A PROGRAMME HERE THAT GIVES 
REASONABLE GRANTS TOP ENCOURAGE 
PEOPLE WHO WANT IN A SENSE TO 
BECOME AN ACTIVE CITIZEN FIGHTING 
BACK AGAINST THE PROBLEMS OF GLOBAL 
WARMING WE WANT TO PUT PUBLIC 
MONEY INTO THIS SO THE DEMAND FOR 
THESE THINGS GROWS AND IN TIME OF 
COURSE THE UNIT COST COST OF 
INSTALLING THESE THINGS WILL COME 
DOWN I'M SURE IT WILL 
BUT UNTIL 
GREEN TECHNOLOGY BECOMES CHEAPER 
THE SAVINGS ALONE DON'T MAKE IT 
WORTHWHILE THE MAIN REASON TO HAVE 
SOLAR PANELS IS TO HELP THE PLANET 
NOT TO HELP YOUR BANK BALANCE NOW

OF NEW TECHNOLOGY WITH CLICK IT IS 
A COUNTRY WHOSE AVERAGE BROADBAND 
SPEED IS THIRTY TIMES SLOWER THAN THE 
WORLD LEADER 
SOME SAY ON LINE VIDEO WILL CAUSE 
ITS INTERNET SERVICE TO GRIND TO A 
HALT ITS POPULATION LIVE IN 
IGNORANCE OF THE WIDE CHOICES 
AVAILABLE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD 
WELCOME TO THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA 
IT'S THE UNDISPUTED HOME OF THE 
INTERNET UNTIL RECENTLY THE 
LARGEST ON LINE COMMUNITY ON THE 
PLANET WHEN IT COMES TO THE NEED 
OF SPEED ARE THE AMERICANS MISSING 
OUT OUT AND KATE'S HERE WITH A FRESH 
SELECTION OF TASTEY SITES FOR YOU 
TO DEVOUR IN WEBSCAPE 
WELCOME TO CLICK I'M SPENCER KELLY 
WE ALL KNOW THE U. S. IS THE 
TECHNOLOGY HUB OF THE UNIVERSE 
IT'S HOME TO MICROSOFT APPLE SUN 
GOOGLE YAHOO M. I. T. THE LIST GOES 
ON AND ON 
SO HOW COME WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
BASICS LIKE DELIVERING THE 
INTERNET TO ITS CITIZENS IT'S 
FALLEN WAY BEHIND A LOT OF OTHER 
COUNTRIES HOW HAS A NINETEEN NINETIES 
BROADBAND LEADER BECOME A TWENTY FIRST 
CENTURY LAGGARD HERE IN MANHATTAN 
THE TYPICAL D. S. L. BILL WOULD BE THIRTY DOLLARS 
PER MONTH THAT'S FOR A THREE MEG 
BIT DOWN LOAD CONNECTION WHICH MAY 
SEEM FINE FINE UNTIL THEY REALISE 
WHAT IS GOING ON WHERE ELSE IN THE 
WORLD 
FOR THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS YOU CAN GET ONE HUNDRED MEG BITS 
THAT PENETRATED TWENTY PER CENT OF THE 
SUBSCRIBERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS 
TARGETING FOR ONE HUNDRED MEG BITS TO 
PENETRATE SIXTY PER CENT PLUS OF THE 
SUBSCRIBER BASE IN A FEW YEARS IF 
YOU LOOK AT PLACENESS HONG KONG AND 
EUROPE IN MANY PLACES YOU CAN GET 
TEN MEG BITS FROM THE BROADBAND 
DOZENS OF SMALL COMPANIES OFFERED 
AMERICAN CONSUMERS EVER DECREASING 
RATES TO THE POINT WHERE THEIR 
BUSINESSES COLLAPSED TODAY MOST 
NEW YORKERS HAVE JUST TWO CHOICES 
FOR HOME INTERNET VIA THEIR PHONE 
OR CABLE T. V. COMPANY IN NEW YORK 
STATE FIFTY TWO PER CENT OF RESIDENTS DON'T HAVE 
ANY INTERNET ACCESS AT ALL 
ESPECIALLY RURAL AREAS AND LOW 
INCOME FAMILIES 
WE HAVEN'T BEEN 
ABLE TO OVERCOME THOSE BARRIERS IN 
TERMS OF INCREASING THE TECHNOLOGY 
ADOPTION RATE OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS 
THAT ARE AT OR BELOW THE POVERTY 
LEVEL THAT BECAUSE MAJOR CO LEVEL OPERATIONS CHARGE TOO MUCH MONEY 
FOR BROADBAND 
I THINK IN THE 
UNITED STATES IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE 
WE ARE COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES 
GIVEN THE SPEED OUR COST ARE NOT 
COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES 
THE LACK OF COMPETITION HAS HAD 
OTHER CONSEQUENCES COMCAST THE 
NATION'S LARGEST RESIDENTIAL CABLE 
T. V. AND INTERNET COMPANY WAS 
RECENTLY ACCUSED OF INTERFERING 
WITH THE DOWN LOADING OF VIDEO 
FILES INTERNET VIDEO DIRECTLY 
THREATENS THE POPULARITY OF T. V. SO 
COMCAST'S ANSWER IS TO CURTAIL DOWN 
LOAD SPEEDS FOR THE BIGGER USERS 
AS WE GET MORE AND MORE THINGS THAT 
TIES US IN THE INTERNET WE HAVE 
XBOX BROADBAND GAMING WE'RE 
GETTING ON LINE MORE AND MORE AND 
RATHER THAN OPENING UP AND GETTING 
BETTER SERVICE MOST OF THESE CABLE

TRYING TO LIPT WHAT WE DO AND PUT

WE'RE SUFFERING PUBLIC PUBLIC WIERKSFIERKS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN HELD

SINGAPORE THEY ALL HAVE WIERKSFY 
IN ALL AREAS W. I. FI IN ALL AREAS L. 
DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS THE CHEAPEST 
WAY TO OFFER PUBLIC ACCESS AS THE 
QUALITY OF LIFE AND CITY SERVICE I 
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY OUR CITY 
GOVERNMENT JUST DON'T DO THAT 
THOSE SAME COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT 
ENCOURAGING COTCH TIGS ON THE ONE 
HAND ARE ON THE OTHER GRADUALLY 
BUILDING THE NEXT GENERATION OF 
FIEBBER OPT PARTICULAR NETWORKS

GOOD MORNING 
IT IS SATURDAY FIFTH APRIL 
BRITISH AIRWAYS SAYS IT HOPES TO 
RUN A NORMAL SERVICE FROM HEATHROW 
TERMINAL FIVE TODAY BUT THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE IT OPENED 
DEBT BY CONTROLLED PARKING ZONES 
ARE THEY KILLING OUR HIGH STREETS 
A LOT OF THE SHOPKEEPERS OPPOSED 
AND UPSET 
IT IS BAD PARKING YOU 
ARE BETTER OFF IN A SUPERMARKET 
PRINCE PHILIP SPENDS SECOND NIGHT 
IN HOSPITAL RECEIVING TREATMENT FOR 
A CHEST INFECTION 
I AM SEAN FLETCHER IN A VERY COLD 
AINTREE JOINED ME FOR THE BUILD UP 
TO THE GRAND NATIONAL 
GET READY TO GET BACK BEHIND THE 
SOFA WE CELEBRATE THE RETURN OF 
DOCTOR WHO WITH FEW OF OUR FAVOURITE MONSTERS MONSTERS WE ARE TRYING OUR HANDS ARE IT'S 
AEROBIC GYMNASTICS BUT WAS MIKE 
BUSHELL BORN TWO 
ZIMBABWE'S BIGGEST OPPOSITION PARTY 
IS GOING TO COURT TO TRY TO FORCE 
THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION TO RELEASE 
THE RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION ELECTION THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE 
IS CONVINCED ITS CANDIDATE MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI HAS ONE BUT PRESIDENT 
MUGABE'S ZANU P. F. PARTY SAY THEY 
WILL BACK HIM IN ANY RUN OFF VOTE 
WHICH IS DETERMINED WHICH IS 
NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME 
TELL US ABOUT THIS LEGAL ACTION 
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS WE CAN 
EXPECT THE OPPOSITION PARTY TO GO 
TO THE HIGH COURT TO TRY TO OBTAIN 
AN ORDER EFFECTIVELY FORCING THE 
ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES TO RELEASE 
THE PRESIDENTIAL RESULT YOU'LL 
REMEMBER THEY CLAIMED THE PARTY 
ITSELF THAT THEY HAD ALREADY WON 
THEIR CANDIDATE MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
HAD WON OUT RIGHTS BASED ON POLLING 
STATION RETURNS BUT THE ONLY 
RESULT THAT COUNTS IS THE ONE FROM 
THE ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES AND A 
WEEK AT THE ZIMBABWE WENT TO THE 
POLLS STILL NO ANSWER THEY ARE 
CONFIDENT THEY WILL GET THIS RESULT 
AND WITHIN FOUR HOURS OF GETTING 
THE ORDER THEY EXPECT TO HAVE 
RESULT OUT IT COULD BE WISHFUL 
THINKING IT WILL BE UP TO THE 
ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES WHEN IT IS 
APPROPRIATE TO RELEASE THE FINAL 
TALLY AND ALSO REVEAL WHETHER ANY 
CANDIDATE HAS WON OUT RIGHT OR 
WHETHER IT WILL GO TO A SECOND 
ROUND 
ARE WE HEARING STORIES ABOUT ROUND A POSSIBLE RECOUNT OR EVEN A 
SECOND VOTE ALTOGETHER 
THERE IS A 
COUNTER CHALLENGE THERE ARE TWO 
SEPARATE ISSUES THERE MAY BE A 
POSSIBILITY OF THIS VOTE GOING TO A 
SECOND ROUND IF NEITHER PARTY HAS 
GOT THE REQUIRED MAJORITY TO BE 
ABLE TO SEE OFF ITS OPPONENT BUT 
WE ARE ALSO GETTING COUNTER CLAIMS 
FROM THE RULING PARTY ZANU P. F. 
THAT THEY MAY LOOK FOR A RECOUNT OF 
SIXTEEN CONSTITUENCIES IN THE 
PARLIAMENTARY VOTE THEY HAVE 
ACCUSED THE OPPOSITION OF BRIBING 
THE ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES DOCTOR NOW 
THOUGH THEY HAVE NOT CHALLENGED 
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN 
CHALLENGING A RESULTS AND 
CHALLENGING THE DOMAIN 
CONTROLLED 
COULD BE 
PUTTING LOCAL SHOPS OUT OF BUSINESS 
AND DESTROYING WHAT IS LEFT OF OUR 
HIGH STREETS THAT IS THE VIEW OF 
THE FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES 
WHICH SAYS THE SPREAD OF PARKING 
RESTRICTIONS ORIGINALLY MEANT TO 
PROTECT RESIDENTS PARKING AND FREE 
UP SPACE FOR SHOPPERS ARE CAUSING 
MORE PROBLEMS THAN THEY SOLVE 
ON THE BEAT THIS IS HELPING SMALL 
BUSINESSES ACCORDING TO WEST 
SUSSEX COUNCIL BUT LOCAL 
BUSINESSES SAY THE PARKING ZONE 
DESIGNED TO PROTECT RESIDENTS 
PARKING IS DESTROYING TRADE AND 
ZAPPING THE LIFE OUT OF THE TOWN 
THERE ARE AROUND SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CONTROLLED 
PARKING ZONES IN TOWNS AND CITIES 
WITH MORE BEING CREATED EVERY MONTH 
BUT WITH AROUND FORTY SMALL 
INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES A WEEK GOING 
BUST MANY FEAR THEY ARE THE FINAL 
NAIL IN THE COFFIN 
WE THINK THE 
CONTROLLED PARKING ZONES OF THE 
DEATH KNELL FOR SMALL INDEPENDENT 
SHOPS ON THE HIGH STREET AS MORE 
AND MORE PARKING RESTRICTIONS ARE 
PUT IN PLACE IN TOWN CENTRES MORE 
INDEPENDENT SHOPS GO OUT OF 
BUSINESS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND A YEAR AT 
THE SAME TIME THERE ARE VIRTUALLY 
NO PART CONSTRICTIONS FOR BIG 
SUPERMARKETS AND RETAIL CHAINS ON 
THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWNS AND MAKE AN 
OFFER ALMOST LIMITLESS FREE PARKING 
THE ZONES WHICH ALLOW PARKING FOR 
A SHORT TIME ARE SUPPOSED TO 
INCREASE THE TURNOVER OF SHOPPERS 
BUT STRICT ENFORCEMENT MEANS IT CAN 
HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT LOCAL 
BUSINESSES HERE SAY THAT AS THE 
PROBLEM I WANT TO GO TO SOME OF 
THE SHOPS BUT BECAUSE OF THE 
CONTROLLED PARKING IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO PARK THEY SAY THIS IS DRIVING 
PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE SHOPS INTO 
OUT OF TOWN SHOPPING CENTRES 
A LOT 
OF CUSTOMERS ARE NOT COMING INTO 
THE TOWN AS FREQUENTLY AS THEY USED 
TO SO THEY ARE NOT BROWSING THEY 
ARE STRESSED THEY ARE LOOKING AT 
THEIR WATCH THEY ARE NOT 
CONCENTRATING THEY ARE WORRYING 
ABOUT GETTING BACK TO THEIR CARS 
IN CITIES IT IS CAUSING SIMILAR 
PROBLEMS 
IT IS A BIT OF A BLUNT PROBLEMS INSTRUMENT AND I KNOW A LOT OF THE 
SHOPKEEPERS OPPOSED AND UPSET ABOUT 
IT 
IT IS VERY BAD PARKING YOU ARE IT BETTER OFF THAN A SUPERMARKET 
COUNCILS SAY IT MEANS TOWN CENTRES 
ARE NOT CLOG TO PUT LONG TERM 
PARKING AND ALLOW MORE PEOPLE TO 
ACCESS THE SHOPS 
I WANT TO INSURE 
SMALL BUSINESSES SURVIVE I WILL DO 
EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP THEM BY 
PUTTING SHORT TERM PARKING OUTSIDE 
THE SHOPS AND YOU HAVE A TURNOVER 
ALL THE TIME AND PEOPLE WILL FIND 
IT CONVENIENT AND THEY WILL 
CONTINUE TO COME TO THE TOWN TO DO 
THEIR SHOPPING 
THIS WEEK THE 
GOVERNMENT ISSUED GUIDELINES THAT 
WARNED COUNCILS CONTROLLED PARKING 
ZONES SHOULD ONLY BE USED IN A 
SMALL AREA IN TOWN CENTRES BUT 
INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES ARE WORRIED 
THAT AS THEY SPREAD IT IS HELPING 
TO DRIVE THEM OUT OF BUSINESS 
PARKING ALWAYS TOUCHES A NERVE AND 
LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GETTING IN 
TOUCH THIS MORNING 
JOHN SAYS I GOT HER FIFTY PARKING 
TICKET WHILE COLLECTING MY 
DAUGHTER'S BIKE L. PARKED FOR FIVE 
MINUTES IN A RESIDENTS' PARKING BAY 
AND THESE RESTRICTIONS WILL KILL 
THE HIGH STREETS 
ANDY IN BEXHILL SAYS I WON'T PAY TO 
POT SO I CAN SHOP IF I CANNOT PARK 
WHERE I WANT TO SHOP I GO HOME 
AND IF I HAVE RECEIVED A PARKING 
TICKET IN A TOWN I NEVER RETURN 
AND A INSURE ANY GOODS SERVICES 
REQUIRED ON NOT SOURCE FROM THAT

RURAL BUCKINGHAMSHIRE AND WE WERE

OF THE TOWNS FEATURED IN THE REPORT 
HE SAYS I COME FROM A PART OF THE 
WORLD WHERE YOUR REPORT THAT HE 
INTERVIEWED THE CARPET SHOP OWNER 
THERE ARE FOUR LARGE CAR PARKS 
WITHIN FOUR MINUTES WALK OF THE 
SHOPS AND THE PEOPLE ARE NOT 
WILLING TO WALK FOR FOUR MINUTES 
THAT IS LAZY 
BRITISH AIRWAYS SAYS IT HOPES TO

TERMINAL FIVE TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE IT OPENED HUNDREDS OF 
FLIGHTS WERE CANCELLED AFTER 
PROBLEMS WITH THE BAGGAGE HANDLING 
SYSTEM LED TO A BACKLOG OF 
THOUSANDS OF PIECES OF LUGGAGE IT 
IS THOUGHT TO HAVE COST BRITISH 
AIRWAYS AROUND SIXTEEN MILLION 
THESE ARE THE SCENES BRITISH 
AIRWAYS' HOPES NEVER TO SEE AGAIN 
AN OPENING THAT TURNED TO ANGER 
THE DESKS ARE CLOSE WHEN WHEN TERMINAL FIVE'S BAGGAGE SYSTEM FAILED 
FLIGHTS WERE CANCELLED BY THE DOZEN 
MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED WERE GROUNDED IN THE 
FIRST NINE DAYS AND THIS IS WHY 
BEHIND THE SCENES A BAGGAGE 
BACKLOG ON A HUGE GALE THOUSANDS 
OF LUGGAGE ARE STILL WAITING TO BE 
SORTED AND RETURN TO THEIR OWNERS 
BUT BRITISH AIRWAYS SAYS TERMINAL FIVE 
IS READY TO TAKE ON THE WORKLOAD 
TODAY THAT MEANS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE FLIGHT THE 
SCHEDULES ARE LIGHT AT THE WEEKENDS 
AND THE TERMINAL IS RUNNING AND 
NOTHING LIKE FULL CAPACITY 
IT HAS 
BEEN A DIFFICULT WEEK FOR BRITISH 
AIRWAYS BUT IF THIS WEEKEND GOES 
WELL NEXT WEEK THEY WILL BE 
WORKING TOWARDS MORE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
OPERATIONS THAT WAY THEY WOULD 
BUILD CONFIDENCE DAY BY DAY AND 
HOPEFULLY THEY CAN LOOK FORWARD TO 
THE TRANSFER OF FLIGHTS FROM 
TERMINAL FOUR WITH GREATER 
CONFIDENCE 
THERE HAS BEEN SCENES CONFIDENCE OF AT TERMINAL FIVE BUT ONLY AFTER 
CANCELLATIONS EASE THE STRAIN IF 
ALL GOES WELL TODAY BRITISH 
AIRWAYS HOPE OF RUNNING A 
CONSISTENT SERVICE MAY START TO 
LOOK MORE LIKE A REALITY

MILLION PEOPLE WILL WATCH THE GRAND 
NATIONAL THIS AFTERNOON WORLDWIDE 
I WAS HOPING FOR AN UMBRELLA 
CLOUDY LANE IS WHAT THEY ARE ALL 
TALKING ABOUT HE IS THE FAVOURITE 
HE IS EXPECTED TO WIN TODAY AND 
THERE IS AN INTERESTING FAMILY 
STORY DONALD MCCAIN TRAINS CLOUDY 
LANE AND THAT IS A NAME WELL KNOWN 
IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD BECAUSE 
GINGER MCCAIN IS DONALD MCCAIN'S 
FATHER AND HE TRAINED RED RUM TO 
THREE VICTORIES IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IN THE

THE OLYMPIC TORCH WILL PASS THROUGH 
LONDON THIS WEEKEND AS IT CONTINUES 
ON ITS JOURNEY FROM OLYMPIA IN 
GREECE TO THE BEIJING TWO THOUSAND EIGHT GAMES 
BUT ACTIVISTS CRITICAL OF THE 
CHINESE GOVERNMENT ARE PLANNING 
SEVERAL DEMONSTRATIONS ALONG THE 
ROUTE WITH THE GAME'S ONLY FOUR 
MONTHS AWAY OUR SPORTS EDITOR 
LOOKS AT WHAT EFFECTS THE PROTESTS 
HIGGINS CHINA HAVING ON THE OLYMPIC 
BRAND BRAND WEMBLEY WAS MEANT TO SEE AN OLYMPIC 
CELEBRATION TOMORROW INSTEAD IT 
WILL WELCOME THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL 
TORCH RELAY SINCE THE WAR WITH THE 
FOCUS NOT ON OLYMPIC IDEALS BUT 
PROTEST OVER CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS 
RECORD THE 
RELATIVELY NEW 
IT WAS STARTED BY GERMANY FOR THE 
NINETEEN THIRTY SIX OLYMPICS AS MEANS OF 
PROMOTING HIT THE'S REGIME TODAY 
IT IS MEANT TO PROMOTE PEACE 
HARMONY AND UNDERSTANDING 
ORGANISERS HOPE THIS MESSAGE WILL 
COME THROUGH THIS WEEKEND 
I THINK 
IT IS WRONG TO ATTRIBUTE ANY MOTIVE 
OTHER THAN A WISH THE TORCH RELAY 
IS A SUCCESS ON ITS LONDON NIGHT 
PASSES OFF PEACEFULLY 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN 
THE ATHENS TORCH CAME TO THE CITY 
LONDON WAS POSING FOR THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
GAMES AND A RELAY SERVED TO IGNITE 
ENTHUSIASM THIS TIME THE EFFECT 
MAY NOT BE SO POSITIVE 
THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES AND OLYMPIC TORCH IS MEANT TO 
CONVEY HARMONY AND PROGRESS AND 
GOOD THINGS ABOUT SPORT IF THE 
OLYMPICS ARE GOING TO BECOME 
ANOTHER POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY THE 
BRAND IS TATE AND 
THE TORCH BY 
THE TIME THE TORCH AND ITS JOURNEY 
ACROSS LONDON BOTH LONDON AND 
BEIJING WILL HAVE THE OLYMPIC 
IDEALS OF THE RELAY WAS MEANT TO 
PROMOTE HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETELY

IN BED WRITING LETTERS 
MICHEAL WAS A ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHER

THAT LAST WEEK WHEN HE WAS 
STANDING NEXT TO MADAME SARKOZY HE 
LOOKED GREAT WITH HER AND IT'S 
BEEN A TREMENDOUS CONSORT TO THE 
QUEEN AND WHEN HE'S SICK LIKE THAT 
MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE HE IS THE LAST 
PERSON WHO YOU THINK WILL END UP IN 
HOSPITAL 
I HEARD SOURCES SAYING HOSPITAL APPARENTLY AS HE WENT IN HE WAS 
GRUMBLING AND COMPLAINING HE 
DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO HOSPITAL IT 
IS NOT IN HIS NATURE TO ACCEPT 
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM 
THAT'S RIGHT HE WILL DO WHAT HE'S 
TOLD WHEN HIS DOCTOR SAYS WE 
SHOULD HAVE A CLOSER LOOK BECAUSE 
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG 
WHILE AND IT'S GONE TO A CHEST IT 
COULD BE MILD OR SERIOUS CHEST 
INFECTION BUT HE WILL BE ABLE TO 
GET X. RAYS AND BLOOD TESTS AND

BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THE ROYAL

THE SPORTS IN USE L. USED TO 
LOOKING FOR THE SIGNS 
I HAVE RESORTED TO THE TEA LEAVES 
PERHAPS CLOUDY CLOUDY MORNING 
CLOUDY LANE ONE OF THE FAVOURITES 
AS WELL TONY MCCOY HAS BEEN TRYING 
SO LONG TO WIN THE NATIONAL 
THERE IS A BIT OF A SWEEPSTAKE AND 
I HAVE CONTRABAND 
I WILL LOOK HIM UP FOR YOU 
GOOD MORNING WE ARE GOING TO BE 
TALKING ABOUT THE FAVOURITES IN A 
MOMENT IT IS NOT OFTEN A PREMIER 
LEAGUE MATCH BETWEEN ARSENAL AND 
THE NEPAL IS OVERSHADOWED AND 
UPSTAGED BY THE LIKES OF BARNSLEY 
PORTSMOUTH WEST BROM L. AM SURE 
THEY WILL RELISH THEIR TRIPS TO 
WEMBLEY WEST BROM WINNERS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
TAKE ON THE ONLY PREMIER LEAGUE 
SURVIVORS PORTSMOUTH THEY HAVE 
NOT BEEN TO THE FINAL SINCE THE 
JUDY GARLAND WAS SINGING IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
ONE MUCH OF THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON 
THE HEROICS OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
SIDES PORTSMOUTH CAN POINT TO 
THEIR OWN GIANT KILLING AT 
MANCHESTER UNITED IT IS THE ONLY 
PREMIER LEAGUE TEAM LEFT AND THEY 
FIND THEMSELVES AS FAVOURITES BUT 
THEY WILL HAVE TO PLAY JUST AS WELL 
AGAINST WEST BROMWICH ALBION IF 
THEY ARE TO WIN IT FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
WE HAVE PLAYED IF 
YOU CHAMPIONSHIP SIDES BEFORE AND 
IT IS TOUGH THEY RUN US TO THE 
WIRE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THAT 
CASE BUT YOU HAVE TO CONCENTRATE 
AND DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ANYBODY 
DON'T ALLOW THE WHOLE OCCASION TO 
RUN AWAY IT IS GREAT IT IS THE 
SEMI FINAL BUT IT IS ABOUT PLAYING 
A PROPER GAME AND GET INTO THE NEXT 
ROUND AND THE NEXT ROUND IS THE 
FINAL 
WEST BROM HAVE MADE IT TO FINAL THE SEMIS WITHOUT FACING A 
PREMIERSHIP TEAM THEY ARE JUST ONE 
GOAL SHORT OF ONE HUNDRED FOR THE SEASON 
HAVING LOST AT WEMBLEY IN THE PLAY 
OFF FINAL LAST YEAR THE PLAYERS 
ARE DETERMINED NOT TO EXPERIENCE 
THAT LOSING FEELING AGAIN 
THAT DID 
STING ALL OF THE PLAYERS WE THEN 
WENT OFF ON OUR SUMMER HOLIDAYS AND 
DID NOT FEEL THE SAME NOBODY WANTS 
TO FEEL LIKE THAT AGAIN L. THINK WE 
CAN USE THAT TO OUR ADVANTAGE 
WEMBLEY IS A GREAT PLACE TO PLAY 
BUT IT IS ONLY GREAT IF YOU WIN 
THEY WILL HAVE THE BACKING OF 
THIRTY THREE THOUSAND FANS AND THEY WILL BE HOPING 
THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER T. 
SHIRT NEXT MONTH 
JUST READING ABOUT YOUR HORSE IT 
SAYS HORSE IN APPARENT DECLINE 
THAT WAS ONE WELL SPENT 
NOT SINCE THE DAYS OF RED RUM HAS 
THERE BEEN SUCH A CLEAR FAVOURITE 
THIS IS STAMPEDE TOWARDS CLOUDY 
LANE FOR HORSES TRAINED BY DONALD 
MCCAIN WHOSE FATHER GINGER MCCAIN 
WHEN THE NATIONAL THREE TIMES WITH 
RED RUM SEAN FLETCHER CAN YOU 
PICK A WINNER

BOOKMAKER WE ARE TERRIFIED THE 
ODDS ARE SIX TO ONE WITH THE NATION WAKES 
UP AND DECIDE TO BACK THIS HORSE 
WITH ALL THE GINGER MCCAIN 
CONNECTION AND IF IT WINS IT WILL 
BE JUST AS BAD FOR BOOKMAKERS AS

MILLION PAYOUT TO LUCKY PUNTERS 
THAT WOULD BE THE DARKEST DAY IN 
GRAND NATIONAL HISTORY IT WOULD BE 
HORRIBLE WE ARE VERY VERY WORRIED 
THE DARKEST DAY FOR YOU BUT NOT 
THE PUBLIC REMEMBER TALKING TO 
YOU THIS TIME LAST YEAR AFTER 
SILVER BIRCH ONE AND YOU'RE OFF TO 
GET THE WHEELBARROWS TO GET THE

HEDGEHUNTER IS POPULAR A FAMILIAR 
NAME A LOT OF SHREWD PUNTERS 
PARTICULARLY FROM IRELAND HAVE COME

KIND OF PRICE THAT THAMES PEOPLE TO 
BET THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO WOULD 
BE IF HEDGEHUNTER AND CLOUDY LANE 
GET TO THE ELBOW AND IF IT IS 
BETWEEN THOSE TWO WE WILL TURN 
AWAY AND START CRYING BECAUSE IF 
EITHER OF THEM WHEN IT WILL BE BAD

UNHURT HE IS O. K. TO RACE THAT IS 
ALL THE SPORTS NEWS AS SUCH HOW 
BENDY DO YOU FEEL IN THE STUDIO 
THIS MORNING CAN YOU GET YOUR LEG 
OVER YOUR EAR L. DON'T THINK SO 
HOW THEN THE R. U. 
NOT A VERY AFTER THIS 
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED AEROBIC 
GYMNASTICS IT IS MORE EXPLOSIVE 
THAN OTHER FORMS OF GYMNASTICS IT 
IS NOT YET AN OLYMPIC SPORT BUT 
THE BRITISH TEAM ARE HEADING TO THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IN GERMANY WITH 
THE KNOWLEDGE THEY CAN BEAT THE 
PROFESSIONALS FROM COUNTRIES LIKE 
RUSSIA AND ROMANIA OR BECAUSE OF 
ONE AMAZING THIRTEEN YEAR OLD 
HALF HE JUST MISSED OUT ON PLAYING 
BILLY ELLIOTT IN THE WEST END BUT 
THAT IS A BLESSING 
INSTEAD AT JUST THIRTEEN HE HAS BECOME 
THE FIRST EUROPEAN CHAMPION FOR 
BRITAIN IN AEROBIC GYMNASTICS 
I JUST LOVE THE FLEXIBILITY THE 
HARD WORK YOU HAVE TO PUT INTO IT 
I JUST LOVE IT IT IS AMAZING THAT 
ALL THIS HARD WORK HAS BUILT UP TO 
SOMETHING GREAT 
NO WONDER HIS DAD 
GETS NERVOUS WATCHING HIS ROUTINES 
SOME OF THE MOVES MAKE YOUR EYES 
WATER SPINNING ON YOUR HANDS IS 
HARD BUT HE CAN DO TWENTY HE IS A 
GROWING NUMBER TEMPTED INTO THIS 
FORM OF GYMNASTICS 
IT IS MORE FUN 
IN GYMNASTIC YOU HAVE TO BE QUIET 
AND PEOPLE CLAP WHEN YOU HAVE 
FINISHED BUT IN AEROBICS 
GYMNASTICS EVERYONE IS UP AND IT IS 
A GREAT ATMOSPHERE 
THIS EXPLAINS 
WHY CLUBS HAVE BEEN BESIEGED BY 
BEGINNERS OF ALL AGES AND ESTABLISH 
GYMNASTS TRYING TO BUILD UP THEIR 
AEROBIC FITNESS IT IS VERY GOOD 
FOR THE STOMACH MUSCLES 
ESPECIALLY AS THE SPORT HAS OLYMPIC 
AMBITIONS 
YOU HAVE TO PUT IN A LOT AMBITIONS MORE EFFORT THAN FOOTBALL OR RUGBY 
IT IS MUCH HARDER 
THE BRITISH TEAM 
HEADING OFF TO THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS IN GERMANY THEY ARE 
HOPING TO TAKE MORE MEDALS OF 
COUNTRIES WHERE THIS SPORT IS 
PROFESSIONAL PROFESSIONAL YOU CAN SEE WHY IT IS CATCHING ON 
IT IS A BIT LIKE DANCE

NORMAL GYM GYMNASTICS 
YES JUST OVER MINUTE ROUTINES 
WILL IT GET INTO THE OLYMPICS 
THEY ARE HOPING TO YES L. WAS NOT 
VERY KIND ABOUT THAT REPORT EARLIER

BECAUSE THE B. B. C. HAD SPENT SO MUCH 
MONEY ON IT BUT TO BE HERE FOR

IS ASTONISHING

WELL NOW ON NEWS TWENTY FOUR IT IS TIME FOR 
NEWSWATCH THE MASSING ON THE 
BORDERS OF ZIMBABWE NOT TROOPS BUT 
B. B. C. JOURNALISTS 
WELCOME TO NEWSWATCH THIS WEEK 
THE B. B. C. HAS A DOZEN REPORTERS 
COVERING ZIMBABWE'S ELECTIONS WHY 
DOES GEORGE ALAGIAH NEED TO BE 
THERE TOO AND WE PAY A VISIT TO THE 
ENGLISH COUNTY THAT FEELS IGNORED 
BY THE B. B. C. ELECTIONS IN ZIMBABWE 
AND PROTRACTED WAIT FOR THE RESULT 
WAS A MAJOR STORY ON THE NEWS THIS 
WEEK GEORGE ALAGIAH WAS SENT TO 
STAND BY A BORDER CHECKPOINT TO 
ANKH K. E. R. MUCH OF THE COVERAGE THE THE B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE BUT 
TONIGHT JOHN SIMPSON IS IN THE 
CAPITAL HAR I. R. A. 
A SENSE OF 
TENSION 
YOU CAN'T SENSE IT TENSION ACTUALLY HERE WE'RE ON THE BORDER 
WITH ME IS B. B. C.'S AFRICA 
CORRESPONDENT JOHN WHAT DO YOU 
MAKE OF LATEST DEVELOPMENTS HAS HAS GEORGE REALLY BEEN ADDING MUCH TO 
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION 
IAN ASKED 
YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF THE SIX AND 
TEN O'CLOCK NEWS S. IT RIGHT TO HAVE 
GEORGE ALAGIAH STANDING ON THE 
BORDER OF ANOTHER COUNTRY 
YES IT 
IS THIS WEEK THE PROBLEM WITH SOME 
OF THE COMMENTS IS THEY'RE NOT 
REALLY THINKING ABOUT IT AS WE'RE 
THINKING ABOUT IT WHEN YOU MAKE A 
DEPLOYMENT LIKE THAT YOU'RE NOT 
THINKING ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO 
THE PROGRAMME THAT NIGHT YOU'RE 
THINKING STRASTEEDGEICALLY ABOUT 
THAT STORY AND WHERE IT WILL ENDS 
UP THE OTHER POINT ONE WILL MAKE 
ABOUT GEORGE IS GEORGE ISN'T ANY 
OTHER PRESENTER HE IS A FORMER 
SOUTHERN AFRICA CORRESPONDENT HE 
IS ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN 
CORRESPONDENTS IN THE FIELD WHEN 
HE BECAME A PRESENTER AND WE DON'T 
WANT TO LOSE THE KNOWLEDGE AND 
EXPERTISE EXPERTISE WHEN THE COST CUTS WERE ANNOUNCED 
WE ASKED HIM ABOUT THE ISSUE IT IS 
ONE VIEWERS RAISE ALTHOUGH TIME 
HAVE A LOOK 
THE PRESENTER OUT ON 
LOCATION ON A MASSIVE STORY WHO 
IS ABLE TO BRING SOMETHING TO THE 
AUDIENCE THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN 
THERE HAD HE OR SHE NOT BEEN THERE 
GREAT WHEN THEY GO THERE AND 
THERE'S NOTHING SOMETIMES THEY'RE 
TALKING TO A CORRESPONDENT FROM THE 
B. B. C. IT CAN BE POINTLESS AND GIVES 
A SENSE OF PROLIVE KAES OR WORSE 
THAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT THROUGH 
WHAT ABOUT THOSE SORT OF INSTANCES 
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT 
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE YOUR SENDING 
GEORGE ALGIEA MET THE GENERAL 
DIRECTOR'S CRITERIA 
BY ANY STRETCH 
THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST STORIES 
OF THE YEAR IT IS A STORY THAT 
HASN'T PLAYED OUT YET ISN'T FULLY 
PLAYED OUT L. WILL REMIND YOU THAT 
HE'S GOT AN EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA 
AND THAT THERE BE BROUGHT TO BEAR 
NOT JUST NOW AND THE LAST WEEK BUT 
HOPEFULLY AS THE STORY PLAYS OUT 
OVER THE COMING DAYS 
NOW HE IS 
INTERVIEWING ESSENTIALLY OTHER 
B. B. C. REPORTERS HE HASN'T JUST BEEN 
DOING THAT HE IS AN EXPERIENCED 
JOURNALIST THE IDEA BEING IN SOUTH 
AFRICA MEANS YOU'RE NOT PART OF 
THE STORY IS NAIVE ACTUALLY THE 
REALITY OF SOUTH AFRICA IS IT IS 
THE MAIN POWER IN THE REGION IT 
HAS INFLUENCE OVER THE AREA AND 
THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
INFLUENCE THAT GEORGE IS SPEAKING 
TO AND BEING INVOLVED WITH BUT 
THERE ARE ELEVEN OTHER REPORTERS THERE 
OTHER B. B. C. STAFF AND EXPERIENCED 
CORRESPONDENTS WHY PRESENT FROM 
LONDON 
THERE ARE ELEVEN PEOPLE THERE LONDON AND THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT 
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE SHEER NUMBER 
OF RADIO STATIONS ON LINE AND T. V. 
OUTPUT IT IS VAST AND THE REALITY 
IS HAVING A PRESENTER OUT THERE 
WHO CAN BRING THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE 
AND KNOWLEDGE TO A STORY WHICH 
HASN'T QUITE FINISHED YET AND IF 
IT DOES PLAY OUT IN A CERTAIN WAY 
WE WILL SEE MORE BENEFIT FROM 
GEORGE IN THAT SITUATION A A DIFFERENT POINT FROM A VIEWER 
NIGEL WHO ASKED 
FOR INSTANCE B. SKY B. AND C. N. N. ARE 
ALSO BANNED 
B. SKY B. ARE NOT IN 
HARARE AT THE MOMENT B. SKY B. WILL 
REMIND YOU ARE THEY'RE BANNED FROM 
THE COUNTRY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 
REASONS WHY WE DO IT THE FACT 
YOU'RE BAN FRED THE COUNTRY MEANS 
YOU CAN'T OPERATE NECESSARILY AS 
YOU WOULD WANT TO IT IS IMPORTANT 
THE VIEWERS ARE REMINDED OF THAT 
THE SECOND REASON IS PEOPLE ARE 
OPERATING IN AN UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT 
I ALSO THINK IT IS FAIR TO THE 
JOURNALIST TOSS POINT OUT TO PEOPLE 
THEY'RE RISKING THEIR SAFETY ON AN 
HOURLY BASIS TO BRING THESE 
REPORTS BACK SO THOSE ARE THE MAIN 
REASONS REASONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE B. B. C. LIKES 
TO TALK ABOUT ITS COMPREHENSIVE 
COVERAGE OF THE U. K. WITH JOURNALISTS 
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THERE'S ONE 
PLACE THAT FEELS IT IS A BIT OF A 
BLACK HOLE PEOPLE THERE SAY WHEN 
IT COMES TO NEWS THEY'RE NOT 
GETTING MUCH FOR THEIR LICENCE FEE 
MY NAME IS ANDREW AI LIVE IN 
CHESHIRE I'M SURE YOU HEARD OF IT 
BIG PLACE IN NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
WITH A POPULATION OF MORE THAN A 
MILLION WE'RE IGNORED WHEN IT 
COMES TO THE B. B. C. OFFERING ANY KIND 
OF T. V. ON LINE OR RADIO SERVICE 
EVERY OTHER COUNTY IN THE U. K. SEEMS 
TO HAVE T. V. COVERAGE ITS OWN RADIO 
STATION OR AT THE LEAST A LOCAL 
SECTION ON THE B. B. C. WEBSITE 
SHROPSHIRE OUR NEIGHBOURING COUNTY 
HAS A POPULATION OF A R. O. U. N. D. ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO 
THAT'S A THIRD OF THOSE LIVING IN 
CHESHIRE YET IT IS SERVED WELL 
WITH ITS OWN RADIO STATION AND 
DEDICATED WEBSITE WITH NEWS 
FEATURES AND INFORMATION OTHER 
SMALLER COUNTIES SUCH AS 
CAMBRIDGESHIRE AND OXFORDSHIRE NOT 
ONLY HAVE RADIO AND ON LINE 
SERVICES BUT THEY GET THEIR OWN T. V. 
NEWS THE NEWS WE DO GET COMES FROM 
MANCHESTER AND LIVERPOOL AND IS OF 
LITTLE INTEREST 
NORTHWEST TONIGHT 
BLACKPOOL AND MERSEYSIDE 
FIFTEEN AND 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD FROM MANCHESTER UNDER UNDER WAY ON THE ISLE OF MAN 
BIG STORIES 
LIKE THE POTENTIAL CLOSURE OF MC 
CALS FIELD HOSPITAL WHERE MY SON 
WAS BORN AND PROTESTS WHICH WANTED 
TO BRING A STAY OF EXECUTION AREN'T 
COVERED ANYONE ON ON LINE NEWS IS 
FORCED TO SEARCH FOR MERSEYSIDE 
STAFFORDSHIRE I PAY MY FEE LIKE 
EVERYONE ELSE SO WHY ARE MY NEEDS 
SIMPLY NOT KATEERD FOR COME ON THE 
B. B. C. IT REALLY ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
ANOTHER VIEWER IS LOUISE AND TAM 
ZIN O'BRIEN IN CHARGE OF B. B. C. 
REGIONAL NEWS IN THE NORTH WEST 
FIRST WHEN YOU WANT LOCAL NEWS 
WHERE DO YOU GET IT 
I GET IT WITH 
GREAT DIFFICULTY AS THE CLIP SAID 
F. YOU WANT NEWS ABOUT CHESHIRE YOU 
HAVE TO GO TO MERSEYSIDE 
MANCHESTER AND STAFFORDSHIRE EVEN 
OCCASIONALLY I FOUND STORIES ON 
THE NORTH WALES PAGES BECAUSE THE 
WELSH BORDER RUNS THROUGH THE EDGE 
OF CHESHIRE AND CHESTER SO IT IS 
VERY DIFFICULT AND IF THERE'S 
NOTHING ON THE B. B. C. THE 
ALTERNATIVES ARE TO GO TO OTHER 
WEBSITES ON THE INTERNET OR TO 
LOOK AT THE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS WHICH 
ONLY COME OUT ONCE A WEEK IN 
CHESHIRE 
WILL YOU EASE'S POINT AND CHESHIRE ANDREW'S WHY DO THEY ALMOST SEE 
CHESHIRE AS A NEWS BLACK HOLE WELL WELL THEY DO HAVE A POINT CHESHIRE 
DOESN'T HAVE B. B. C. LOCAL RADIO 
STATION AND DOESN'T HAVE A LOCAL 
WEBSITE TO SAY IT IS A NEWS BLACK 
HOLE IS A LITTLE UNFAIR NORTHWEST 
TONIGHT DOES HAVE A JOURNALIST IN 
CHESHIRE RADIO MERSEYSIDE AND 
MANCHESTER COVERS LARGE PART OF THE 
COUNT YIFPLT THE POINT THOUGH IS 
MADE IT IS TRUE THERE ISN'T A 
GOOD ENOUGH SERVICE PROVIDING 
ENOUGH LOCAL CONTENT FROM THE B. B. C. 
WE HAVE GOT PROPOSALS THAT ARE 
SUBJECT TO B. B. C. TRUST APPROVAL WE 
HAVE PROPOSALS TO INTRODUCE A MUCH 
MORE COMPREHENSIVE WEB BASED 
SERVICE A B. B. C. LOCAL SERVICE FOR 
CHESHIRE ON LINE WE DID HAVE 
PROPOSALS FOR A RADIO STATION IN 
CHESHIRE BUT WHEN THE LICENSE FEE 
SETTLEMENT WAS MADE UNFORTUNATELY 
IT HAD TO BE PROST PONED 
SOO WHAT 
DO YOU THINK OF WHAT YOU HEARD I I DON'T THINK THAT ARGUMENT HOLDS 
WATER THE WEBSITE FOR THE NEWS ON 
LINE ALREADY EXISTS THE TEMPLATES 
ARE THERE FOR THE COUNTY PAGES IT 
WOULDN'T COST THE B. B. C. ANYTHING TO 
CREATE THAT ONE PAGE TO PUT THE 
NEWS FEED FOR THE CHESHIRE STORIES 
IN ALREADY AND GIVEN THE WEBSITE 
FOR NEWS ON LINE HAS HAD A MASSIVE 
REVAMP AND PROBABLY A LOT OF MONEY 
POWERED INTO IT IT IT SEEMS A LOST 
OPPORTUNITY TO RECTIFY THAT ERROR 
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY IT 
NEEDS TO GO THROUGH TRUST APPROVAL 
TO CREATE A NEW SITE WHEN THE 
EXISTING FRAMEWORK IS THERE 
WELL I 
CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU THINK WHY 
NOT SET UP SOMETHING IN THE 
MEANTIME AND THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT 
THING TO DO WHEN WE HAVE A 
COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL GOING 
THROUGH SOMETHING THAT NEEDS QUITE 
A RIGOROUS APPROVAL PROGRESS SOME 
OF WHAT TAMZIN GETS THE OFFICIAL 
GO AHEAD WOULD THAT IMPRESS YOU 
OR IS THAT NOT FAR ENOUGH 
I THINK 
MY FEELING IS I BELIEVE IT WHEN I 
SEE IT THERE'S HALF A MILLION 
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE COUNTY WHO 
BETWEEN THEM SPEND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION ON 
LICENSE FEES IT IS NOT FAIR ALL 
THAT REVENUE IS RAISED FOR THE B. B. C. 
AND PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING EVEN THE 
MOST BASIC SERVICE SUCH AS ONE 
SOLITARY WEB PAGE WHERE ALTHOUGH 
NEWS FIELDS COME TOGETHER 
WE TAKE 
IT SERIOUSLY I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR 
REGIONAL SERVICES AND FOR ME IT IS 
A LARGE PART OF MY JOB TO HAVE 
UNIVERSALITY OF SERVICE IN THE 
NORTH WEST IT IS UNFAIR TO SAY WE 
DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY THE 
PROPOSAL IS COMPREHENSIVE AND 
SHOULD PROVIDE A MUCH BETTER 
SERVICE FOR PEOPLE IN CHESHIRE 
LIKE I SAY AT THE MOMENT AS IT 
GOES THROUGH AN APPROVAL PROGRESS 
TO ESTABLISH SOMETHING NOW ISN'T 
RIGHT BY THE END OF THE YEAR WE 
SHOULD KNOW WHETHER THIS SERVICE 
CAN GO AHEAD 
ARE YOU PREPARED TO 
GIVE THE B. B. C. AT LEAST THE CHANCE TO 
IMPROVE AND THEN JUDGE THEM AT THE 
END OF THE YEAR 
YES I'M WILLING 
TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY BUT I 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING IN 
PLACE BY THE END OF THE YEAR THIS 
IS AN ISSUE I HAVE BEEN PURSUING 
FOR FOUR YEARS IT'S TAKEN THIS 
LONG TO HAVE A DISCUSSION FACE TO 
FACE WITH SOMEBODY FROM THE B. B. C. 
ABOUT IT SO YES I'M WILLING TO 
GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT LONGER BUT IT 
IS UNFAIR IN THE MEANTIME WE STILL 
DO NOT HAVE EQUALITY OF SERVICE IT 
IS A GREAT DISSERVICE FOR THE 
PEOPLE PAYING THE LICENCE FEE AND 
PEOPLE FUNDING YOUR JOBS FOR PEOPLE 
LIKE YOU BUT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY 
GET ANYTHING BACK IN RETURN THANK THANK YOU WHEREVER YOU ARE LIVE WE WANT 
TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS CALL US 
THANKS FOR WATCHING YOU COULD BE 
MAKING OUR NEWS NEXT WEEK

FORCE THE COUNTRY'S ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION TO RELEASE THE RESULT OF 
LAST SATURDAY'S PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION THE MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IS CONVINCED IT

RUN OFF VOTE 
HOW IS THIS APPLICATION TO COURT

WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE 
OPPOSITION END D. C. IS GOING TO 
LODGE AN APPLICATION FOR THE 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION TO BE FORCED 
EFFECTIVELY TO PUBLISH THOSE 
RESULTS N. B. C. IT IS LOOKING FOR A 
COURT ORDER MOVEMENT FOR

HOPING TO BE ABLE TO GET WITHIN 
FOUR HOURS OF THAT COURT ORDER

WE'RE GETTING NEWS THAT THE 
OPPOSITION ARE APPEALING TO THE 
UNITED NATIONS TO INTERVENE TO 
AVOID BLOODSHED AS THE COUNTRY 
PREPARES FOR ANOTHER RUN OFF HAVE 
YOU HEARD ANY MORE ON THAT 
I HAVE BEEN ON THE TELEPHONE AT TWO 
AND HINDI SEAT SPOKESPERSON IN 
HARARE AND MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE PERSON 
THEY BELIEVE MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WON 
ON THE BASIS OF RESULTS FREELY 
AVAILABLE OUTSIDE POLLING STATIONS 
WHICH THEY PUBLISHED EARLIER THIS 
WEEK THEY SAY GOING TO A SECOND 
ROUND WOULD BE A PRETEXT FOR 
VIOLENCE WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD THE 
WAR VETERANS LAST NIGHT WARNING 
THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES 
THERE MAY BE NEED TO DEFEND THE 
SOVEREIGNTY OF ZIMBABWE THE 
OPPOSITION AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
ACTIVISTS ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT 
IF THERE IS SECOND ROUND IT 
EFFECTIVELY WILL MEAN A MAJOR 
CLAMPDOWN INTIMIDATION AND A 
STEPPING UP OF SECURITY THAT IS 
WHY THEY ARE APPEALING TO THE 
UNITED NATIONS AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PUT 
PRESSURE ON ZANU P. F. TO ACCEPT THE 
RESULT WHICH IS ALREADY IN THE 
PUBLIC DOMAIN EFFECTIVELY BLOCKING 
A SECOND ROUND 
BRITISH AIRWAYS' HOPES TO RUN A 
NORMAL SERVICE FROM HEATHROW 
TERMINAL FIVE TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE IT OPENED A WEEK AGO 
HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS WERE CANCELLED 
AFTER PROBLEMS WITH BAGGAGE THESE 
ARE THE SCENES BRITISH AIRWAYS' 
HOPES NEVER TO SEE AGAIN AN 
OPENING THAT TURNED TO ANGER WHEN 
TERMINAL FIVE IS BAGGAGE SYSTEM FAILED 
FLIGHTS WERE CANCELLED BY THE DOORS 
BEHIND THE SCENES A BAGGAGE BACK 
LOT THOUSANDS OF BUYERS ARE STILL 
WAITING TO BE RETURNED TO THEIR 
OWNERS AT TERMINAL FIVE IS NOW READY 
TO TAKE ON A FULL WORKLOAD TODAY 
THAT MEANS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE FLIGHT SCHEDULES 
ARE LIGHTER AT THE WEEKENDS 
IT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT WEEK FOR 
BRITISH AIRWAYS IF THIS WEEK AND 
GOES WELL NEXT WEEK THERE WILL BE 
MOVING TOWARDS MORE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
OPERATIONS THEY WILL BUILD 
CONFIDENCE DAY BY DAY AND HOPEFULLY 
BE ABLE TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE 
TRANSFER OF FLIGHTS FROM TERMINAL 
FOUR WITH A MUCH GREATER CONFIDENCE 
THEY HAVE BEEN SCENES OF CALM BUT 
ONLY AFTER CANCELLATIONS EASED THE 
STRAIN IF ALL GOES WELL TODAY 
BRITISH AIRWAYS HOPE OF RUNNING A 
CONSISTENT SERVICE MAY START TO 
LUKE MOORE LIKE A REALITY 
CONTROLLED PARKING ZONES COULD BE 
PUT IN LOCAL SHOPS OUT OF BUSINESS 
AND DESTROYING WHAT IS LEFT OVER 
HIGH STREET ACCORDING TO THE 
FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES 
WHICH SAYS THAT THE SPREAD OF 
PARKING RESTRICTIONS ARE CAUSING 
MORE PROBLEMS THAN THEY SOLVE 
ON THE BEAT IN THE TOWN OF LEWES 
THIS IS HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES 
ACCORDING TO WEST SUSSEX COUNCIL 
BUT LOCAL BUSINESSES SAY THAT 
CONTROLLED PARKING ZONES HER 
DESTROYING TRADE AND SAPPING THE 
LIFE OUT OF THEIR TOWN THERE 
AROUND SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CONTROLLED PARKING 
ZONES IN TOWNS AND CITIES 
NATIONWIDE BUT WITH AROUND FORTY 
SMALL INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES A WEEK 
GOING BUST MANY FEAR OR THESE 
ZONES ARE THE FINAL NAIL IN THE 
COUGHLAN COUGHLAN WE THINK CONTROLLED PARKING ZONES 
AT THE DEATH KNELL FOR SMALL 
INDEPENDENT SHOPS ON THE HIGH 
STREET AS MORE PARKING 
RESTRICTIONS ARE PUT IN PLACE WERE 
SMALL INDEPENDENT SHOPS GO OUT OF 
BUSINESS BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO PARKING 
RESTRICTIONS FOR BIG SUPERMARKETS 
AND RETAIL CHAINS ON THE INSIDE OF 
POUNDS POUNDS THE ZONES WHICH ALLOW PARKING FOR 
A SHORT TIME IN THE TOWN CENTRE 
ARE SUPPOSED TO INCREASE THE 
TURNOVER OF SHOPPERS AND BOOST 
TRADE LOCAL BUSINESSES HERE IN 
LEWIS SAY THIS IS THE PROBLEM L. 
WANT TO GO TO SOME OF THE SHOPS BUT 
BECAUSE OF THE CONTROLLED PARKING 
ZONE IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO PARK 
AROUND HERE 
A LOT OF CUSTOMERS ARE NOT COMING 
INTO THE TOWN AS FREQUENTLY AS THEY 
USED TO THERE WERE PRAYERS IN THE 
SHOPS THERE ARE STRESSED THERE 
ARE LOOKING AT THEIR WATCH THEY 
ARE NOT CONCENTRATING ON WHAT 
THEY'RE DOING 
IN CITIES THERE CAUSING SIMILAR 
PROBLEMS PROBLEMS IT IS A BLUNT INSTRUMENT KNOW 
LOT OF THE SHOPKEEPERS ARE OPPOSED 
TO IT 
THE PARKING IS VERY BAD YOU'RE 
BETTER OFF IN THE SUPERMARKET 
COUNCIL SAY CONTROLLED PARKING 
ZONES MEAN TOWN CENTRES ARE NOT 
CLOG UP WITH LONG TERM PACKING 
MY CONCERN IS THOSE TOWN BUSINESSES 
I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN DO TO 
HELP FOR SMALL BUSINESSES BY 
PUTTING SHORT TERM PARKING OUTSIDE 
THEIR SHOPS IN THE CENTRE OF ART 
POUNDS SO WE HAVE TURNOVER ALL 
TIME AND PEOPLE FIND IT CONVENIENT 
AND WILL FIND IT CONVENIENT HAVE 
BEEN IT DESPITE THE CENTRE OF OUR 
TOWNS TOWNS INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES ARE WORRIED 
THAT AS THE ZONES SPREAD THERE 
HELPING DRIVE THEM OUT OF BUSINESS

AND BEIJING WILL HOPE THE OLYMPIC 
IDEALS THE WHEELCHAIR WAS MADE TO 
PROMOTE HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETELY 
FORGOTTEN THE RELAY 
IN A MOMENT A LOOK AT ALL OF THE 
PAPERS IT HAS HAPPENED TO MOST CAR 
OWNERS AT SOME POINT JUST POPPING 
DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL HIGH STREET BUT 
YOU CANNOT FIND ANYWHERE TO PARK 
BUT WHEN YOU DO FIND A SPACE YOU 
HAVE TO PAY FOR A SET PERIOD AND 
RUSH OFF SHOPPING THE FEDERATION 
OF SMALL BUSINESSES NOW SAY THAT 
PARKING RULES IN PLACE CAUSED 
SHOPPERS TO RUSH AND THERE KILLING 
UP SMALL BUSINESSES SHEILA RANGERS 
FROM THE R. A. C. FOUNDATION THEY SAY 
THERE IS NO BUSINESS GOING ON AND 
THAT IS DAMAGING SMALL SHOP ONEROUS 
WHAT DO YOU SAY 
PARKING POLICIES CAN MAKE OR BREAK 
THE TOWN CENTRES SHOPPERS WHO COME 
BY CAR ABOUT SIXTY PER CENT DO SAY IF THEY 
CANNOT FIND SPACE IF IT IS TOO 
EXPENSIVE WILL THEY GET A TICKET 
WOULD BECOME MARCO FU OR THEY WILL 
JUST GO SOMEWHERE ELSE DESPITE 
GET A TICKET WHEN THEY COME BACK TO 
THE CAR 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN 
THIS ONE PERSON HAS WRITTEN TO US 
SAYING THAT CONTROLLED PARKING 
ZONES IN DONCASTER'S KILLING A 
TURN OFF IN DONCASTER ARE 
KILLING THE TOWN OFF 
THE TOWN CENTRE THE COUNCILS HAVE 
GOT TO REMEMBER THAT OUT OF TOWN 
CENTRES HAVE FREE PARKING VERY 
OFTEN ACCESSIBLE PARKING SO THE 
TOWN CENTRE CAR PARKS HAVE GOT TO 
BE COMPETITIVE EASY TO USE AND 
CLEARLY MARKED 
WHAT IS THE IDEAL 
SOLUTION A BALANCE HAS TO BE 
STRUCK BETWEEN SERVING THE 
INTERESTS OF PEOPLE USING THE TOWN 
CENTRES AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
BUSINESSES THERE BUT ALSO KEEPING 
THE TRAFFIC GOING 
IT'S REALLY 
ABOUT CONSULTATION DON'T JUST TALK 
TO THE RESIDENTS TALK TO THE 
BUSINESS OWNERS AS WELL SO OFTEN 
IT IS JUST A RESIDENTS BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE VOTES THAT THE 
COUNCILLORS TALK TO IT IS ABOUT TO 
COMMUTERS AND TOURISTS MAKING SURE 
EVERYONE HAS A SAY AND IF IT IS 
GOING WRONG DON'T BE TOO PROUD TO 
CHANGE IT 
FROM COUNTY DURHAM 
THIS USED TO BE A THRIVING MARKET 
TOWN BUT PARKING IS NOW A PROBLEM 
THERE ARE NOW DOUBLE YELLOW LINES 
ON THE BACK LANES THE CAR PARKS WE 
HAVE ARE TOO SMALL SO PEOPLE GO TO 
DARLINGTON TO 
SHOP A LOT OF 
BUSINESSES WILL CLOSE BEFORE THE 
DEVELOPMENTS ARE YOUR HEARING A 
LOT OF THOSE COMPLAINTS YOU 
HEARING 
OVER ZEALOUS PARKING HEARING ENFORCEMENT IS PUTTING PEOPLE OFF 
WHEN YOU HAVE TOWNS IN COMPETITION 
IT IS EASY FOR THE MOTORIST IN A 
CAR TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT IS 
WHAT COUNCILS HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND 
PARKING CAN BE A SERVICE TO THE 
COMMUNITY NOT JUST A WAY OF MAKING 
MONEY 
WHAT IF THEY INTRODUCED A MONEY SCHEME WHERE YOU HAD A LIMITED 
AMOUNT OF TIME TO PARK BUT YOU DID 
NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT THAT IS 
WHAT IS PUTTING PEOPLE OFF GOING TO 
TOWN CENTRES THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE 
GOING TO BE CHARGED TO DO SHOPPING 
WHEREAS IF YOU GO OUT OF TOWN YOU 
CAN DO IT FOR FREE 
IN SOME PLACES 
YOU CAN PARK FOR THIRTY MINUTES FOR 
FREE 
IT 
IS NOT A LOT OF TIME IT FREE IT IS NOT BUT IT ENCOURAGES 
PURCHASING A PINT OF MILK NO 
TROUBLE WITH CURING YOU CAN STOP 
QUICKLY IN THE TOWN CENTRE AND MAKE 
SURE PURCHASES WITH QUEUING 
CONSULTATION WITH EVERYBODY 
INVOLVED BUT YOU ACCEPT THAT IS 
NOT HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT IN IN MANY CASES THE CONSULTATION IS NOT 
ADEQUATE OFTEN PROBLEMS EMERGE 
AFTER THE SCHEME IS PUT IN 
COUNCILS ARE NOT WILLING TO GO BACK 
AND MAKE MODIFICATIONS WHEN IT 
SHOULD BE REALLY A CYCLE LOOK AT 
IT AGAIN FOR GOODNESS SAKE THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN TO TALK 
TO US 
DURING OUR REPORT EARLIER ON THAT 
ISSUE WE FOCUSED ON LEWES TOWN IN 
EAST SUSSEX WE SPOKE TO A 
COUNSELLOR FROM WEST SUSSEX SO IF

NOW WE CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THE 
WEATHER 
WINTER IS BITING BACK THIS WEEKEND 
AFTER THE SPRING SUNSHINE OF THE 
PAST WEEK WE COULD HAVE SNOW AND 
ICE THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND AND EVEN 
INTO THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK 
ALMOST ANYWHERE ACROSS THE U. K. TEN 
O'CLOCK THIS MORNING WINTRY 
SHOWERS ACROSS SCOTLAND A MIXTURE 
OF SLEET AND SNOW SOME GUSTY WIND 
TOWARDS THE NORTH NEAR THE COAST 
IN PARTICULAR THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
BRIGHTENING UP AFTER THE MORNING 
RAIN LINCOLNSHIRE CLOUDY AND GREY 
AT TEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING WITH 
OUTBREAKS OF RAIN SOUTH OF THAT 
EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST AND 
THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND DRY AND 
BRIGHT BROKEN CLOUD AND SUNSHINE 
STILL FAIRLY MILD NINE DEGREES 
PRETTY DECENT IN DEVON AND CORNWALL 
THE SCILLY ISLES A BIT OF CLOUD 
TOWARDS THE FAR NORTH OF WALES AT 
TIMES NORTHERN IRELAND A CHILLY 
BREEZE AND A FEW SHOWERS AFFECTING 
THE NORTH COAST THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
SOME SHOWERY RAIN SLIDING ACROSS 
EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST THE 
BEST SUNSHINE TODAY ACROSS WALES 
AND SOUTH WESTERN ENGLAND FURTHER 
NORTH THE SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE 
INCREASINGLY WINTRY BY THE END OF 
THE DAY TEMPERATURES DOWN TO WHAT 
WE HAVE HAD NOW OF COURSE THE 
GRAND NATIONAL THIS AFTERNOON SOME 
SHOWERS TEMPERATURES EIGHT DEGREES 
COVERAGE ON B. B. C. ONE AS THE 
AFTERNOON GOES ON OVERNIGHT 
TONIGHT THE SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE 
TO BE WINTRY ACROSS THE U. K. ACROSS 
WALES THE MIDLANDS CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN PARTS WE COULD SEE SOME 
SNOW OVERNIGHT COVERING UP TO FIVE 
CENTIMETRES THE RISK OF ICE TOO 
AS TEMPERATURES FALL TO FREEZING 
WATCH OUT FOR ICY PATCHES IF YOU 
ARE HEADING OUT EARLY TOMORROW 
MORNING AND SOME SNOW ACROSS 
SOUTHERN PARTS GRADUALLY CLEARING 
AS THE MORNING GOES ON BEHIND THAT 
SUNSHINE AND WINTRY SHOWERS AGAIN 
THE RISK OF A COVERING 
PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE HIGH GROUND 
TEMPERATURES WILL FALL AWAY AS THE 
WINTRY SHOWERS ARRIVE ON MONDAY 
MORNING THE RISK OF ICY PATCHES ON 
THE ROADS AGAIN WINTRY SHOWERS 
PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE U. K. IT WILL FEEL CHILLY 
WINTER WILL REALLY BITE BACK IN THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS STAY TUNED TO 
THE FORECAST 
IF YOU ARE STILL THINKING ABOUT THE 
DALEKS AND YOU HAVE GOT ANY 
QUESTIONS FOR THE VOICE OF THE 
DALEKS OR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR 
DOCTOR WHO SEND US AN E. MAIL OR A 
TEXT MESSAGE 
WITH THE PRICE OF GAS AND 
ELECTRICITY SOARING SOME 
HOMEOWNERS HAVE TURNED TO SOLAR 
POWER TO CUT THE COST OF THE ENERGY 
BILLS THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO 
ENCOURAGE EVEN MORE OF US TO GO 
GREEN FROM TOMORROW IF YOU LIVE 
IN ENGLAND OR WALES YOU WILL NOT 
HAVE TO GET PLANNING PERMISSION TO 
INSTALL SOLAR PANELS ON YOUR ROOF 
BUT CRITICS HAVE SAID THE DECISION 
LAST YEAR TO CUT GRANTS IS PUTTING 
PEOPLE OFF 
EVERY YEAR SEVENTEEN THOUSAND HOMEOWNERS IN 
THE U. K. TURN TO THE SUN TO HELP 
PROVIDE POWER FOR THEIR HOMES IT 
IS PART OF A GREEN A WAY OF LIFE 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS ENCOURAGING 
US TO LIVE DE GREENER WAY A 
GREEN A WAY OF LIFE DO THE FIGURES 
STACK UP THIS MAN HAD SEWED UP 
PANELS INSTALLED FIVE YEARS AGO AND 
HE ALSO HAS PANELS TO PROVIDE 
ELECTRICITY SOLAR PANELS I I WOULD EXPECT BY SAVE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED 
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PER YEAR BUT I AM ON OIL I 
WOULD NOT GET SUCH A SAVING ON GAS 
THAT MEANS I WILL PAY BACK WITHIN 
TEN YEARS 
BUT HIS PAY BACK IS NOT 
TYPICAL SOME CONSUMERS COULD WAIT 
FOR UP TO TWENTY YEARS BUT SOLAR 
PANELS ONLY LAST AROUND TWENTY YEARS 
SO THAT COULD WRITE OFF ANY 
POTENTIAL SAVINGS ARCHITECTS WHO 
SPECIALISE IN SUSTAINABLE HOUSING 
SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT 
GOING ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH TO HELP 
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GO GREEN THE THE GOVERNMENT'S INCENTIVE IS TOTALLY 
INADEQUATE FRANKLY PATHETIC THEY 
DO VERY LITTLE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE 
TO INVEST IN THIS SORT OF 
TECHNOLOGY PEOPLE DO IT MOSTLY AT 
PRESENT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IT IS 
THE RIGHT THING TO DO RATHER THAN 
ANY FINANCIAL INCENTIVE THE THE GOVERNMENT HAS RELAXED THE PLANNING 
LAWS BUT GREEN GROUPS SAY THEY 
SHOULD REALLY BE FOCUSING ON 
INCREASING THE GRANTS AVAILABLE AT 
THE MOMENT THE MAXIMUM YOU CAN GET 
TOWARDS THE COST OF SOLO HOT WATER 
PANELS IS FOUR HUNDRED COMPARED TO A 
MINIMUM OUTLAY OF THREE THOUSAND THE 
PAYBACK TIME IS ANYTHING BETWEEN 
TEN TO TWENTY YEARS GREEN GROUPS SAY THAT 
WITH SUCH A LONG PAYBACK TIME 
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH INCENTIVE FOR 
PEOPLE TO GO SOLO THEY WANT AN 
INCREASE ON THE CURRENT FOUR HUNDRED GRANT 
TO GO SOLAR 
WE WOULD LIKE THEM 
TO INCREASE THE GRANT TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
POUNDS WE WOULD ALSO LIKE THE 
GOVERNMENT FOR ELECTRICITY TO 
INCREASE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT FROM 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED UP TO SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
THAT WOULD CUT 
THE PAY BACK DOWN TO A FEW YEARS 
BUT THERE IS NO SIGN FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT THAT THERE WILL BE MORE 
MONEY ON OFFER 
I THINK WE HAVE GOT 
A PROGRAMME THAT GIVES REASONABLE 
GRANTS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO WANT 
IN A SENSE TO BECOME AN ACTIVE 
CITIZEN FIGHTING BACK AGAINST 
GLOBAL WARMING WE ARE TRYING TO 
PUT PUBLIC MONEY INTO THIS SO THAT 
THE DEMAND FOR THESE THINGS GROWS 
AND IN TIME THE UNIT COST OF 
INSTALLING THESE THINGS WILL COME 
DOWN I AM SURE IT WILL UNTIL UNTIL GREEN TECHNOLOGY BECOMES CHEAPER 
THE SAVINGS ALONE JUST DON'T MAKE 
IT WORTHWHILE THE MAIN REASON TO 
HAVE SOLAR PANELS IS TO HELP THE 
PLANET NOT TO HOLD YOUR BANK

SENIOR MINISTERS THAT THEY WOULD 
LOOK AT IT AGAIN THEY HAVE HAD 
ASSURANCES BUT MINISTERS HAVE 
CLAIMED THERE IS NO PLAN FOR A 
CHANGE 
SO HE MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGE MISTAKEN OR PERHAPS MISLED REMIND 
US OF HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK AND 
WHO IS GOING TO WIN AND LOSE THIS THIS WAS INTRODUCED IN THE BUDGET IN 
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN GORDON BROWN'S SWANSONG 
BUDGET HE WANTED TO CUT THE BASIC 
RATE OF TAX FROM TWENTY TWO P. TO TWENTY PENCE 
HE HAD TO DO THAT BY RAISING THE 
LOWER RATE OF TAX THE FIRST BAND 
OF INCOME WHICH HAS BEEN DOUBLED 
FROM TEN P. UP TO TWENTY PENCE FOR MOST 
PEOPLE OR MORE THAN SIXTEEN THOUSAND PER 
YEAR THEY GAIN FROM CUTTING THE 
BASIC RATE WILL MORE THAN OUTWEIGH 
THE LOSS FROM RAISING THE LOWER 
RATE THE GAME BUT IF YOU ARE ON 
LESS THAN SIXTEEN THOUSAND PER YEAR YOU 
WILL PAY MORE TAX NOT LESS THE 
BIGGEST LOSSES WILL BE PEOPLE 
EARNING AROUND SEVEN THOUSAND TO EIGHT THOUSAND PER 
YEAR QUITE A LOT OF MONEY A MONEY 
BOX LISTENER WHO HAS A STATE 
PENSION A SMALL PENSION FROM HER 
JOB A BIT OF SELF EMPLOYED WORK 
SHE HAS A TOTAL OF TWELVE THOUSAND PER YEAR 
SHE WILL PAY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE PER YEAR MORE IN 
TAX WHY SHOULD YOU PAY MORE TAX SO 
THAT WEALTHY PEOPLE CAN PAY LESS 
THE M. P. YOU WERE IN CONTACT WITH HE 
SAID LOT OF HIS CONSTITUENTS 
WOULD BE AFFECTED THE PROBLEM IS 
THAT MANY OF THEM DO NOT ACTUALLY 
REALISE 
NO AT THE MOMENT PEOPLE REALISE DON'T BUT WHEN THE PENSION 
PAYMENTS AND THE PAY PACKETS START 
ARRIVING PEOPLE WILL SUDDENLY SEE 
MORE TAX IS BEING DEDUCTED ANYONE 
OVER SIXTY FIVE WILL DO VERY WELL OUT OF 
THE CHANGES THEY ARE PROTECTED BY 
A MUCH BIGGER TAX ALLOWANCE PEOPLE 
ON MORE THAN SIXTEEN THOUSAND PER YEAR WILL 
PAY LESS TAX PEOPLE ON MORE THAN 
FORTY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PER YEAR WILL PAY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT LESS 
TAX SWINGS AND ROUNDABOUTS BUT 
THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT THE LOWER 
PAID WILL PAY MORE TAX THE HIGHER 
PAID WILL PAY LESS EXACTLY THE 
OPPOSITE FROM WHAT YOU'D EXPECT 
FROM A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH INDEED MORE FROM THE 
MONEY BOX TEAM ON RADIO FOUR 
ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO DOCTOR WHO 
WAS OUT IN THE WILDERNESS WITH NO 
COMPANIONS TO FIGHT MONSTERS WITH 
AND NOWHERE TO PARK HIS TARDIS HIS 
REVIVAL IS STILL TAKING US BY TALL 
HE RETURNS FOR THE FOURTH SERIES IN 
HIS NEW INCARNATION BY STORM 
EXTERMINATE X. TERMINATE 
NO NO 
DON'T TELL ME A RIFT IN TIME AND 
SPACE HAS BEEN OPENED 
IT WAS NOT 
THAT LONG AGO THAT A FONDNESS FOR 
DOCTOR WHO BEING A WHOVIAN WAS 
NOT PERHAPS THAT CALL NOW THEY 
ARE OUT AND PROUD THAT COOL IT IT IS A MAINSTREAM HIT 
YOU ON A 
WHOVIAN 
I WILL ADMIT IT YES WHOVIAN YOU ARE A WHOVIAN 
I AM PROUD OF 
BEING A WHOVIAN 
LAY OFF THE PILLS 
FOR A WEEK OR SO GOT TO GO SURREY 
THE REINVENTED DOCTOR WHO HAS 
BECOME RATHER POPULAR 
BRING THEM 
HOME 
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT GET HIS HOME SECOND YEAR BECAUSE THE B. B. C. HAD 
SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON IT TO BE 
HERE FOR YEARS LATER AND THE LAST 
VIEWING FIGURES WERE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION 
IS IT ASTONISHING AND EXCITING IT IT IS NOT JUST BRITS THIS FAMILY ARE 
FROM CALIFORNIA THEY ARE HERE 
LARGELY BECAUSE OF DOCTOR WHO AND 
THIS EXHIBITION AT EARLS COURT SHE SHE THINKS DAVID TENNANT IS VERY HOT 
TRULY 
IS THAT THE ATTRACTION TRULY MOSTLY AND WE LIKE THE ALIENS TOO 
BUT MOSTLY DAVID TENNANT DAVID DAVID TENNANT CERTAINLY SEEMS TO HAVE 
REACHED A NEW TYPE OF FAN NO 
WONDER THERE'S SO MUCH INTEREST IN 
HOW LONG HE STAYS IN THE SERIES 
BUT FOR MANY IT'S ALL ABOUT 
MONSTERS AND BEING A BIT SCARY 
BUT AS EVERY NEW GENERATION OF 
DOCTOR WHO FANS KNOWS THERE IS ONE 
SAFE PLACE TO WATCH IT FROM DO YOU 
WATCH FROM BEHIND THE SOFA YES YES SOMETIMES 
HAVE YOU EVER WATCHED SOMETIMES FROM BEHIND THE SOFA 
YES THE 
WEEPING ANGELS 
I HAD TO GO OUT OF 
THE ROOM ONCE WHEN I WATCHED AN 
EPISODE 
THERE ARE DALEKS AROUND EPISODE THE CORNER 
DALEKS L. DON'T MIND DALEKS 
DOESN'T MIND DALEKS WHAT DALEKS ARE THINGS COMING TO WITH TODAY'S 
YOUTH YOUTH NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF YOU SEE 
IT IS KIDS' STUFF 
YOU MUST BE 
AFRAID OF THE DALEKS 
GOOD GRIEF 
HELLO HEAD DALEK YOU ARE THE 
VOICE OF THE DALEKS LET'S SEE YOU 
IN ACTION CORRECT L. AM SORRY TO CORRECT RUIN THE MAGIC FOR PEOPLE BUT IT 
MAKES PEOPLE FEEL MORE AT EASE IF 
THEY KNOW AN ACTUAL DALEK IS NOT IN 
THE STUDIO 
JUST FOR YOUNGER 
VIEWERS I AM IMPERSONATING A REAL 
DALEK BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT BRING 
A REAL DALEK THERE WOULD BE MAYHEM 
A REAL DALEK WOULD SAY YOU WILL 
BE EXTERMINATED ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING ALEX WAKEMAN HAS BEEN 
IN TOUCH HE IS SIX YEARS OLD HE 
WANTS TO KNOW HOW THE DALEK VOICE 
GETS TO BE SO SCARY 
I JUST HAVE TO 
GET VERY CROSS IF I JUST SPOKE 
NORMALLY IT WOULD SOUND A BIT LIKE 
THAT 
YOU COULD GET MY KIDS TO THAT BRUSH THEIR TEETH AND DO THEIR 
HOMEWORK 
DO 
YOUR HOMEWORK BRUSH HOMEWORK BRUSH YOUR TEETH TELL US ABOUT THE 
EVOLUTION OF THE DALEKS AND WHAT 
THEY ARE LIKE IN THIS CURRENT 
SERIES OF DOCTOR WHO 
WHO SAYS THEY 
ARE COMING BACK THAT'S THE CLEVER 
THING RUSSELL T. DAVIES DOES HE 
ADDS SOMETHING NEW TO THE ETHOS OF 
THE DALEKS THERE WAS ALWAYS 
SOMETHING EXTRA AND DIFFERENT FOR 
ME TO DO OF COURSE IF I TOLD 
YOU I WOULD BE EXTERMINATED 
THEY WERE JUST CREATED AS A KIND OF 
POST WAR HORROR STORY BACK IN THE 
SIXTIES ALSO THE TERROR OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF NUCLEAR WAR THAT WAS 
GOING ON THEN FOR WORRY ABOUT 
BEING INVADED AND BEING BLOWN UP 
THE 
I WAS INTO DOCTOR WHO WHEN I WAS A KID 
I WAS FASCINATED BY THE VOICE OF 
THE DALEKS IT IS QUITE IRONIC THAT 
I HAVE ENDED UP DOING IT IT WAS 
NEVER AN AMBITION 
HOW DID IT 
HAPPEN 
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE I HAVE BEEN HAPPEN WORKING FOR THE AUDIO ADVENTURES OF 
DOCTOR WHO WHICH WE WERE DOING ON 
C. D. AND NOW DOWNLOAD MY DAY JOB IS 
TO BE THE PRODUCER OF THOSE BUT I 
AM ALSO AN ACTOR WHEN WE DID THE 
DALEKS IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE I THOUGHT I SHOULD 
DO THE VOICES SHOULDN'T I 
SUDDENLY MY CHILDHOOD DREAM CAME 
TO LIFE BECAUSE RUSSELL T. DAVIES 
IS A BIG DOCTOR WHO FAN HE HEARD 
THE ORDEAL ADVENTURES HE SAID WE 
NEED THAT TRY TO DO IT ALSO 
BECAUSE I 
HAVE GOT THIS GIZMO WE WE HAVE BEEN ASKING ABOUT THE 
TECHNOLOGY WHICH TURNS YOUR VOICE 
INTO THAT VOICE 
IT WAS BASED ON 
OLD TECHNOLOGY BACK IN THE SIXTIES 
IT IS RETRO TECHNOLOGY IT IS A 
KIND OF NEW GIZMO BUT IT IS BASED 
ON OLD CIRCUITRY IT IS DONE BY BOB 
MOOG DEPENDING ON THE FREQUENCY 
IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THE 
VOICE IS BEING SWITCHED ON AND OFF 
IF YOU TURN IT UP IT YOU START 
SOUNDING REALLY STUPID NOW I AM 
ONE OF THE CYBER MEN DIFFERENT DIFFERENT MOODS 
WE COULD DO A WHOLE MOODS PROGRAMME ON THAT 
I THINK YOU ARE 
GOING TO BE COMING BACK LATER I I WILL BE BACK OH A MALFUNCTION 
THE DALEKS ARE CROSS WITH YOU 
I THINK DOCTOR HE RETURNS THIS EVENING 
SIX TWENTY P. M. B. B. C. ONE DOCTOR WHO

A SHOP YOU SIMPLY CAN'T OR ELSE YOU HAVE BAD 
YOU OVER 
OVERSTAY AND 
YOU DON'T 
WANT 
BACK 
IS THAT 
A DIRECT RESULT 
BACK IS THAT A DIRECT RESULT OF PARK 
N. G. I 
HAS BEEN 
PARKING THE 
EXPERIENCE IN 
SAINT 
ALBANS WHERE 
WE AS I SAID 
MANAGE THE 
PARKING 
WE HAVE 
OFF TREET 
AND ON TREET 
PARKING GEARED 
TO THE 
AND ONSTREET PARKING GEARED TO THE NEEDS 
YES 
BUT ALSO 
GEARED TO THE 
NEEDS OF PEOPLE 
GEARED TO THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE VISITING SAINT 
ALBANS TO 
SHOP 
CITY CENTRE SO THEY CAN GO 
TO THE 
SHOPS DO 
THEIR SHOPPING 
AND LEAVE 
SHOPS DO THEIR SHOPPING AND LEAVE SO SHORT TERM SHOPPING THAT ALLOWS A 
TURN AROUND THE SPACE AND ALSO DO 
IS WE 
WORK CLOSELY WITH ALL 
THE INTEREST GROUPS 
OF COURSE 
THAT 
INCLUDES THE 
LOCAL 
CHAMBER OF 
COMMERCE LOCAL SHOP EEPERS SO 
THAT 
ONE 
OF THE 
WE FOUND 
IS THAT 
SHOPKEEPERS NEED 
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT PARK IS AVAILABLE NEAR TO THEM 
SO THEY 
CAN INFORM 
THEIR CUSTOMERS 
AND THE 
FINISH ONE 
OF THE 
THINGS WE 
ARE NOW 
LOOKING AT 
IT IS 
A 
OF WANT 
N. G. TO 
COLLECT LARGER ITEMS 
SO 
WE ARE 
LOOK 
THE 
LOOK 
LOOKING AT 
OF SAY VOUCH 
PEOPLE SO THEY CAN LOAD UP PURCHASED 
SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING PURCHASED BUT I 
JUST WONDER 
HOW MUCH 
IT 
COST ME IF I WANT 
PARK OUTSIDE 
A SMALL BUSINESS ON SAINT STREET WELL THAT 
MAY NOT BE 
THE STREET WELL THAT MAY NOT BE THE BEST 
EXAMPLE TO 
CHOOSE BECAUSE 
A MAIN THREW ROUTE 
BUT IF 
YOU GO 
THERE THIS MORNING IF 
YOU WERE TO 
CHOOSE TO DRIVE 
INTO SAINT 
ALBANS AS 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE 
THIS 
MORNING BECAUSE 
WE HAVE 
EXCELLENT 
SHOPS AND A SPLENDID MARKET YOU CAN 
PARK IN A LARGE CAR PARK VERY NEAR 
TO THE 
SHOPS FOR 
EIGHTY FOR TWO 
HOURS THAT ENSURES A TURN AROUND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME 
INTO SAINT 
ALBANS TO 
SHOP 
BUT THERE ARE 
OTHER 
WAYS 
IF YOU 
WANT TO JUST PICK UP 
SOMETHING THAT THAT CAN BE ENABLED 
IN 
THERE 
IS HIGH 
Y. 
MANAGED PRETTY 
MUCH ZERO TOLERANCE 
OF CONTRAVENTION 
N. G. RULES 
AND THE 
SMALL 
BUSINESSES SAYS SMALL 
REALLY UNDER PRESSURE AND IS OFFERED FREE PARK 
N. G. AT 
SUPERMARKET BIG HYPER MARKET 
COUPLE OF MILES OUTSIDE THE TOWN WHAT 
IN 
ENTIVE NOR 
SHOPPER 
TO WANT TO USE A LOCAL GROCERS INSTANCE WHERE 
NIP 
IN GET 
A FEW 
THINGS AND 
NIP OUT 
WHEN THEY COULD 
GO IT 
COUPLE OF 
MILES WAY AND SHOP FOR THEY NEED 
AT THE 
SUPERMARKET AS 
COUNSELLOR 
IS THAT 
SOMETHING THAT 
YOU CAN TOLERATE AND SEE GROCERS 
FOR INSTANCE 
GOING OUT 
OF BUSINESS 
FOR INSTANCE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS OR 
IS THAT 
SOMETHING THAT 
WANT TO AVOID WELL WHAT 
WE WANT 
TO 
TRY TO ACHIEVE 
IS A 
BALANCE 
THE CITY CENTRE IN 
TERMS OF THE 
SHOPS 
THERE ARE 
THAT'S ONE 
REASONS WHY 
WE TRY 
TO ENABLE 
SHORT TERM PARK 
N. G. AS 
CLOSE 
TO THE 
SHOPS AS 
POSSIBLE 
SHOPS AS POSSIBLE BUT IN OBVIOUSLY SAINT 
UNIQUE 
PLACE ALL TOWNS 
ARE DIFFERENT 
HAVE A MEDIEVAL STREET STRUCTURE 
WHICH 
DOESN'T ACTUAL 
Y. FACILITATE A 
TREET 
PARKING ON 
THE MAIN 
THROUGH ROUTES 
BUT WE 
MADE EVERY 
EFFORT TO ENSURE 
THAT THE 
NEEDS 
SPHAUL BUSINESSES AND ALL 
SORTS OF 
OTHER INTEREST GROUPS RESIDENTS OFFICE WORK RS 
ARE TAKEN 
INTO 
ACCOUNT SO THAT 
WE ACHIEVE 
A BALANCE 
IN 
TERMS OF 
CAR USE AND WHERE PEOPLE 
CAN PARK 
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME 
THIS MORNING 
JUST A 
COUPLE OF 
EMAILS 
FOR INSTANCE THESE 
REFERRING TO PLACE ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY RICHARD SAYS

NOW WITH THE PRICE OF GAS AND ELECTRICITY 
SOARING SOME 
HOMEOWN 
ELECTRICITY SOARING SOME HOMEOWNERS HAVE 
TURNED TO 
SOLAR POWER TO HELP 
CUT THE COST 
OF THEIR 
ENERGY BILLS 
GOVERNMENT 
IS ENCOURAGING 
MORE 
US TO 
GO GREEN 
TOMORROW IF 
YOU LIVE IN 
WON'T HAVE TOO GET 
PERMISSION TO INSTAL SOLAR PANELS ON 
YOUR ROOF 
EVERY YEAR SEVENTEEN THOUSAND HOMEOWN RS IN U. K. TURN 
TO THE 
SUN TO 
HELP PROVIDE 
POWER FOR 
THEIR HOMES 
IT IS PART 
A GREEN R. 
THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT 
IS ENCOURAGING 
US TO LIVE 
LIVE 
WITH ENERGY 
PRICES SO HIGH IT 
A SHREWD 
FINANCIAL MOVE 
BUT DO 
THE 
UP SIMON 
MAL ETTE HAD SOLAR HOT WATER 
MALLETTE HAD SOLAR HOT WATER PANELS INSTALLED FIVE 
YEARS AGO 
HE ALSO HAS 
PANELS TO 
PROVIDE ELECTRICITY ON HIS 
HOME AND 
IS SAVING 
MONEY ON HIS 
BILLS ON 
THESOLAR 
THERMAL 
I WOULD 
BILLS EXPECT I SAVE BETWEEN ZERO AND ZERO A YEAR 
BUT I'M 
ON OIL 
I 
WOULDN'T GET 
SUCH A 
SAVING IF 
ON 
GAS WHICH 
I'LL PAY BACK 
WITHIN TEN 
YEARS BUT 
BUT SIMON S. PAY BACK 
IS NOT 
TYPICAL 
SOME CONSUMERS COULD WAIT FOR UP TO 
TWENTY YEARS 
BUT SOLAR 
PANELS ONLY LAST 
AROUND TWENTY YEARS SO THAT COULD 
OFF ANY POTENTIAL SAVINGS ARCHITECTS WHO 
SPECIALISE IN 
SUSTAIN 
THE 
GOVERNMENT 
IS NOT 
DOING ANYWHERE 
NEAR 
ENOUGH TO 
HELP PEOPLE WHO WANT 
TO GO GREEN 
I THINK 
THE GOVERNMENT 
TO GO GREEN I THINK THE GOVERNMENT'S IN ENTIVES 
ARE TOTALLY 
IN DEQUATE FRANK Y. PATHETIC AND DO 
INADEQUATE FRANKLY PATHETIC AND DO VERY LITTLE TO 
EN 
OURAGE PEOPLE 
TO 
INVEST IN THIS SORT 
OF TECHNOLOGY 
PEOPLE DO IT MOST Y. AT PRESENT BECAUSE 
THEY BELIEVE 
THING TO DO 
RATHER THAN ANY 
FINANCIAL IN ENTIVE THE GOVERNMENT THE GOVERNMENT'S RE 
AXED THE 
PLANNING 
GOVERNMENT'S RELAXED THE PLANNING LAWS 
BUT GREEN 
WHAT THEY 
SHOULD BE FOCUSING 
ON 
IS IN 
THE 
GRANTS AVAILABLE 
AT THE 
MOMENT 
THE MAXIMUM YOU CAN GET TOWARDS THE 
COST OF SOLAR 
HOT WATER 
PANELS IS 
FOUR HUNDRED AND THAT COMPARES TO A MINIMUM 
OUT AY 
OF 
ZERO AND THE PAY 
OUTLAY OF THREE THOUSAND AND THE PAYBACK TIME 
IS ANYTHING 
BETWEEN 
TEN AND 
TWENTY 
YEARS GREEN 
GROUPS SAY 
WITH 
YEARS GREEN GROUPS SAY WITH SUCH LONG PAY 
ACK TIME 
THERE'S NOT 
IN 
ENTIVE FOR 
PEOPLE TO GO SOLAR 
THEY WANT 
AN IN 
REASE ON 
ZERO GRANT 
WE WOULD 
LIKE THE 
GOVERNMENT TO IN 
REASE THE 
LEVEL FOR SOLAR PANELS TO AROUND ONE THOUSAND OR FIVE HUNDRED 
LIKE 
THE GOVERNMENT FOR 
REASE THE 
MAXIMUM AMOUNT THEY 
OFFER FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO 
THAT WOULD 
CUT 
THAT WOULD CUT THE PAY 
ACK TO 
A FEW YEARS 
THERE'S NO SIGN FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
MORE MONEY WILL BE OFFER ON 
WE HAVE PROGRAMME THAT REASON 
BLE GLANTS 
TO EN 
PEOPLE WHO WANT 
IN A 
SENSE TO 
BECOME AN ACT 
VE CITIZEN 
FIGHT N. G. 
BACK 
PROBLEMS OF 
WARMING 
WE ARE TRYING 
TO PUT PUBLIC 
MONEY 
INTO THIS 
SO THE 
DEMAND FOR 
THESE 
THINGS GROWS 
AND IN TIME THE 
UNIT COST THE COST 
OF INSTALLING 
UNIT COST THE COST OF INSTALLING THESE 
COME DOWN AND I'M 
SURE IT WILL 
BUT UNTIL GREEN 
TECHNOLOGY 
BECOMES CHEAPER 
THE 
SAVINGS ALONE DON'T MAKE IT WORTH 
WHILE THE MAIN REASON TO HAVE SOLAR 
PANELS IS TO HELP 
THE PLANET 
NOT TO 
HELP YOUR BANK BALANCE WELL 
LET'S TALK 
ABOUT THIS TO STEVEN 
HAYLE DIRECTOR 
OF THE 
GREENALLIANCE 
ALLIANCE AND JAMES WOODHOUSE RCH WHO 
IS PROFESSOR 
ASTING AND 
INNOVATION AT DE MONTH MONTH 
FOR THE 
UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR IT 
COSTS ABOUT 
ZERO 
THERE'S A 
GRANT ALREADY SHOULD 
BE IN 
REASED OR 
WORTH IT 
I 
DON'T THINK IT IS 
WORTH 
TO WAIT A LONG TIME BEFORE RENEWABLE 
ENERGY 
AS 
EFFICIENT AS 
THE 
NATIONAL GRID 
WHAT 
GOVERNMENT 
SHOULD BE PUTTING 
MONEY 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE PUTTING MONEY INTO IS 
LONG TERM R. 
AND D. 
GIVEN THE 
INTO IS LONG TERM R. AND D. GIVEN THE LOOSE 
THEY PICKED IN 
NORTHERN ROCK 
I 
MUCH 
OF AN 
EXCUSE EXCUSE THEY A NOT LINK D. 
ARE THEY 
THEY THEY 
LINK D. AS MALCOLM MADE 
ARE VERY LINKED AS MALCOLM MADE CLEAR 
THIS IS MORE 
CAMPAIGN TO EN 
HIP 
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN THAN 
IS A 
SENSIBLE PIECE 
OF TECHNOLOGY 
RIGHT NOW TO SAVE MONEY 
IT 
HAVE ANY IM ACT ON 
INSTALLING SOLAR PANELS VERY LITTLE VERY LITTLE THE MAIN ELECTION 
ARE COAL 
FIRED POWERED 
STATION 
THEY ARE NOT 
IN YOUR HOME WHEN YOU TURN ON AN 
ELECTRIC HEART OR HAVE A SHAVE IN 
YOU 
ARE NOT 
MAKING 
MISSION SO IF YOU WANT TO FIX C. O. TWO 
PLACE TO DO IT 
MORE A QUESTION 
OF A 
GOVERNMENT 
CAMPAIGN 
FOR HEARTS AND 
MINDS TO GET 
CAMPAIGN FOR HEARTS AND MINDS TO GET EVERYBODY IN 
NEW LABOUR 
S. BIG TENT 
THERE 
WILL BE A 
LOT OF PEOPLE 
LISTENING AND 
WATCHING WHOA 
WILL 
THAT WHO WILL SAY I AS 
AN 
INDIVIDUAL CAN 
DO SO LITTLE WHEN 
IN FACT THE 
PROBLEM LIES WITH 
IN FACT THE PROBLEM LIES WITH 
GOVERNMENTS LIES WITH BIG POWER 
THEY 
ONCE WHO HAVE TO COME 
UP WITH 
THE 
INITIATIVE AND THE NEW TECHNOLOGY 
THIS IS 
NOT AN EITHER OR EVERY ONE 
THIS IS NOT AN EITHER OR EVERY ONE OF US 
HAS RESPONSIBILITIES EVERY 
OF US HAS RESPONSIBILITIES EVERY ONE OF US 
HAS CHOICES 
WE HAVE 
OUR 
OWN CARBON FOOTPRINT JAMES 
IS RIGHT 
TO SAY 
THAT THE 
THINGS DONE 
BY 
GOVERNMENT MAKE A MASS TO FIRST 
OF ALL 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN 
TO FIRST OF ALL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE TURN 
ON 
HOME 
TO 
TO DO THAT 
OUR 
CONCERN AT 
GREENALLIANCE IS 
THAT THE 
GREEN 
CHOICE FOR 
PEOPLE 
THAT THE GREEN CHOICE FOR PEOPLE SHOULD BE THE 
EASY 
CHOICE AND 
THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS TO DO 
THAT THEY 
HAVE 
TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE TAKING ONE 
STEP TOMORROW BECAUSE THEY GETTING RID 
OF THE 
RED TAPE THAT 
WILL MAKE 
IT EASIER 
TO INTRODUCE 
THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN OUR HOMES THEY HAVE TO GO MUCH 
AS YOUR REPORT SAID ISN'T IT ABOUT 
INDIVIDUALS AND WHAT 
THE GOVERNMENT 
CAN DO 
TO PERSUADE SMALL 
THINGS IN 
OUR HOMES 
PERHAPS JUST 
ABOUT 
INSTALLING NEW 
PERHAPS JUST ABOUT INSTALLING NEW GADGETS 
TAKING A WAY 
GADGETS IT IS ABOUT TAKING AWAY THINGS 
OUR BEHAVIOUR 
THINGS IT IS ABOUT OUR BEHAVIOUR PERHAPS USING 
LESS ELECTRICITY NOT 
PERHAPS USING LESS ELECTRICITY NOT USING POWER SHOWERS THAT SORT THING THAT 
IS AN 
IMPORTANT 
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN 
THEY HAVE 
TO 
MOUNT IF YOU WANT TO 
HAVE A 
COLD MOUNT SHOWER EVERY MORNING POWER SHOWER 
RATHER THAN A 
COLD SHOWER COLD 
COLD WOULD SAVE 
THE PLANET 
LESS POWER 
WE'RE IN 
THE TWENTY ONE CENTURY 
THERE'S A 
WE'RE IN THE TWENTY ONE CENTURY THERE'S A DIVISION 
OF LABOUR 
THERE'S GOING 
BE AN ENORMOUS Y. LONG WAIT 
THE ENERGY YOU GENERATE FROM YOUR 
HOME IS GOING 
TO BE 
ANYTHING AS COST 
EFFECT 
VE AS 
THAT GENERATED BY A 
LARGE CENTRALISED FACILITY NO ABOUT IT 
MAKE THE 
ABOUT IT CHOICE CLEARLY 
THOUGH TECHNOLOGY 
WORKS IN 
ANY PLACE 
TIME FOR 
ANY HOUSEHOLD SOLAR POWER 
IS GOING 
TO WORK BETTER IN CAIRO THAN IT IN CAMDEN 
BUT EACH 
OF US 
CAN MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE JAMES 
IS RIGHT 
TO 
SAY IF 
THE GOVERNMENT 
DOESN'T DO 
THE THING ON COAL 
FIRED POWER 
STATIONS 
PEOPLE 
TO SAY 
WHAT'S THE 
POINT 
OF ME 
DOING THE 
RIGHT THING 
BUT PEOPLE 
CAN ACT 
AND THE 
BUT PEOPLE CAN ACT AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO MAKE IT EASIER 
THERE'S A 
LONG WAY TO GO 
TOMORROW 
IS A 
FIRST STEP 
IS IT 
WORTH SPEND 
N. G. 
ZERO ON 
THAT MIGHT NOT WORK 
WELL IN 
CAMDEN 
JUST TO MAKE 
YOURSELF FEEL 
BETTER 
YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT 
IS RIGHT 
FOR 
YOUR HOUSE IN 
YOUR LOCATION 
THERE ARE 
THREE THING THAT MAKE THIS 
DIFFICULT 
FIRST OF ALL 
MUCH RED TAPE THAT 
PROBLEM IS BEING 
ADDRESSED TOMORROW 
SECOND OF ALL 
THE UP RONT COST 
IS TOO 
GREAT 
NEED A 
SCHEME TO 
TACKLE THAT 
PERHAPS PEOPLE 
SHOULD BE ALLOWED 
TO 
PERHAPS PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO 
BORROW 
AGAINST THE 
VALUE OF THEIR 
HOME AND 
PAY IT 
BACK WHEN THEY SELL 
THEIR HOUSE 
NOT HAVE TO SPEND IT UP 
FRONT AND THEY NEED TO KNOW IF THEY 
FRONT AND THEY NEED TO KNOW IF THEY GENERATE ELECTRICITY 
AT HOME 
FROM 
SOLAR WHAT PRICE WILL THEY GET FOR 
IT WHEN 
THEY ARE RE 
AXING PLANNING 
IT WHEN THEY ARE RELAXING PLANNING PERMISSION FOR SOLAR PANELS ALL VERY WELL 
BUT WHAT 
GO FOLLOW THE GYPSIES NORTH LONDON AND BUY A PIECE 
OF LAND 
MAKE A HOME ON IT THE PERMISSION TO 
BUILD IS 
WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE DESPERATE 
DESPERATELY NEED IF 
HAVE 
DESPERATELY NEED IF THEY ARE TO HAVE AN AFFORD

THAT'S NOT BEING
