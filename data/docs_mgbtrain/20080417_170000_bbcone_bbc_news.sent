MAN WHO HEDGED A HOME SECRETARY

RESENTMENT LIE NOT WITH THE 
IMMIGRANT POPULATION BUT WITH

BIGGEST VICTORY EVER IN THE MAYORAL 
ELECTIONS 
IN COURT TODAY AS THE TEENAGER 
ACCUSED OF HIS MURDER APPEARED 
BEFORE A DISTRICT JUDGE THE SEVENTEEN 
YEAR OLD YOUTH WAS REMANDED IN 
CUSTODY OUR CORRESPONDENT FIONA 
TROTT IS IN LIVERPOOL NOW 
TROTT IS IN LIVERPOOL NOW TONIGHT SIX OTHER FAMILIES FROM 
THE CROXTETH AREA ARE ALSO FACING 
THE HARSH REALITY OF WHAT THIS 
INVESTIGATION NOW INVOLVES TWO OF 
TODAY'S DEFENDANTS ARE JUST SIXTEEN 
YEARS OLD THEY'RE ACCUSED OF 
ASSISTING THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CHARGED 
WITH RHYS'S MOTHER 
I'M LOOKING AT MY TEETH 
RHYS JONES WAS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER 
ELEVEN YEAR OLD BOY 
MAD ABOUT EVERTON FOOTBALL CLUB 
AND ENJOYED PLAYING IT TOO IN FACT 
HE WAS RETURNING HOME FROM FOOTBALL 
PRACTICE THE NIGHT HE WAS SHOT HE 
TOOK A SHORTCUT ACROSS THIS PUB CAR 
PARK HIS KILLER RODE PAST ON A 
BIKE AND OPENED FIRE 
BUT TODAY ALMOST EIGHT MONTHS ON 
SIX PEOPLE APPEARED IN COURT 
SURROUNDED BY SECURITY 
HERE AT LIVERPOOL MAGISTRATES' 
COURT RHYS'S PARENTS CAME FACE TO 
FACE WITH THE WOMAN WHOSE OWN SON 
IS ACCUSED OF KILLING RHYS WHEN 
THE CHARGE WAS READ OUT AGAINST THE 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD RHYS'S MOTHER MELANIE 
BEGAN TO CRY AT SOME POINT DURING 
THIS MORNING'S HEARING SHE ALSO 
SHOOK HER HEAD IN DISBELIEF 
AND COMING OUT AFTER NINETY MINUTES IN 
COURT THEY BOTH KNEW IT WAS ALL 
OVER FOR TODAY BUT THE START OF A 
VERY LONG ROAD IN THIS PENDING 
TRIAL 
EVEN HERE ALL THOUGHTS WERE ON THE INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATION WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING IT HAS 
AFFECTED THIS SCHOOL GREATLY WE 
ALL FEEL VERY STRONGLY FOR THE 
PARENTS 
THIS IS A FAMILY WHOSE PARENTS LIVES HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY 
EVERY EVERTON FAN AND EVERY PARENT 
KNOWS THEIR STORY BECAUSE MOST OF 
THEM THINK THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MY 
SON SON ALL SIX DEFENDANTS ARE IN CUSTODY 
TONIGHT THEY'RE DUE TO APPEAR IN 
COURT AGAIN NEXT FRIDAY IN THE 
MEANTIME PEOPLE LIVING VERY CLOSE 
TO WHERE RHYS WAS KILLED CAN ONLY 
WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT 
IN A SCAM THAT MAY HAVE COST 
TAXPAYERS MILLIONS OF POUNDS MORE 
THAN ONE HUNDRED CONSTRUCTION 
COMPANIES HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF 
FIXING PRICES WHEN BIDDING FOR 
CONTRACTS TO BUILD NEW SCHOOLS AND 
HOSPITALS THE OFFICE OF FAIR 
TRADING IS ACCUSING WELL KNOWN 
FIRMS LIKE BALFOUR BEATTY AND 
CARILLION OF OPERATING A CARTEL 
MAKING PRICES ARTIFICIALLY HIGH 
JOHN MOYLAN HAS THE DETAILS 
IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST INDUSTRIES 
IN THE U. K. TURNING OVER BILLIONS OF 
POUNDS EVERY YEAR BUT TODAY THE 
CONSTRUCTION WORLD IS AT THE CENTRE 
OF ALLEGATIONS OF WIDESPREAD 
FINANCIAL WRONG DOING WHICH MAY 
HAVE CHEATED TAXPAYERS OUT OF 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS 
SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN THE 
BUSINESS INCLUDING BALFOUR BEATTY 
CARILLION AND KIER ARE ALLEGED TO 
HAVE COLLUDED ON BIDS WHICH PUSHED 
UP THE COSTS ON BIDS RELATING TO 
SCHOOLS UNIVERSITIES AND HOSPITALS 
WE HOPE THAT AS A RESULT OF OUR 
ENFORCEMENT ACTION TODAY THE 
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY HAS TAKEN 
NOTE AND IT WILL BE A MUCH LESS 
WIDESPREAD PRACTICE BUT WE 
CERTAINLY DID COME ACROSS EVIDENCE 
THAT MAYBE THOUSANDS OF CONTRACTS 
HAD BEEN AFFECTED IN THIS WAY 
WORTH POTENTIALLY OVER ONE BILLION 
OR MORE 
SO HOW DID THE BUILDERS 
RIG THE PRICES TAKE FOR EXAMPLE 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW SCHOOL 
WHICH HAS BEEN PRICED AT TEN 
MILLION THREE FIRMS ARE ASKED TO 
TENDER FOR THE WORK BUT THEY 
COLLUDE ON THE PRICE B. AND C. PUT 
IN INFLATED BIDS WHICH RULE 
THEMSELVES OUT THAT ALLOWS COMPANY 
A TO BID TWELVE MILLION KNOWING IT'S 
SURE OF WINNING THE DEAL WHEN THE 
NEXT PROJECT COMES UP FOR TENDER 
THEY COLLUDE AGAIN LETTING COMPANY 
B. WIN THIS TIME IT HAPPENED HERE 
AT THE REDEVELOPMENT BULL RING IN 
BIRMINGHAM FOUR FIRMS TENDERED TO 
INSTALL THE ROOFING SYSTEM BUT TWO 
BID ARTIFICIALLY HIGH SOME 
RECEIVED HIDDEN COMPENSATION 
PAYMENTS ALL FOUR HAD COLLUDED 
SHARING DETAILS OF THE BIDS THEY 
PLANNED TO MAKE BALFOUR BEATTY IS 
ONE 
DOZENS OF COMPANIES 
NAMED TODAY A ESTIMATE IT 
CONFIRMED IT WAS CO OPERATING WITH 
THE INVESTIGATION AND HAD BEEN 
GRANTED LENIENCY THE COMPANY 
INITIALLY REFUSED OUR REQUEST FOR 
AN INTERVIEW SO WE WENT TO THEIR 
GROUP HEAD OFFICE GIVEN YOU ARE 
INVOLVED IN A LOT OF PUBLIC SECTOR 
PROJECT PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO 
KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON BUT THE 
COMPANY WOULDN'T TALK OTHERS 
REFUSED INTERVIEWS TOO THE 
ORGANISATION THAT REPRESENTS THE 
INDUSTRY ALSO PLAYED DOWN TODAY'S 
DEVELOPMENTS 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF DEVELOPMENTS CASES COMPANIES WERE NOT PUTTING A 
COVER IN SIMPLY NOT TO GET THE JOB 
BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO BUSY THEY 
WANTED TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T 
WANT TO OFFEND THE CLIENT AS I SAY 
IT'S A PRACTICE THAT HAS BEEN 
ELIMINATED FROM THE INDUSTRY WHEN 
YOU HAD A TENDER AND IT WAS A 
SURPRISE AND YOU WERE BIDDING ON 
THE LOWEST PRICE 
ALL ONE HUNDRED TWELVE FIRMS 
NAMED WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
RESPOND TO THE ALLEGATIONS THOSE 
FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED COMPETITION 
LAW COULD FACE SUBSTANTIAL FINES 
WITH NOW IS OUR ECONOMICS 
CORRESPONDENT HUGH PYM WE HEARD 
ABOUT THE FINES AT THE END THERE 
WHAT CAN THE OFT DO 
THE OFT CAN 
FINE THEMSELVES TEN PER CENT OF THEIR 
RELEVANT TURNOVER IN THE U. K. 
CONSTRUCTION MARKET THAT COULD RUN 
TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS EACH 
ONE ANALYST SAID IT WOULD BE MORE 
LIKE THREE MILLION PER COMPANY WHERE 
DOES THAT MONEY GO IT GOES TO THE 
TREASURY ALREADY PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
THAT WE ARE THE VICTIMS OF THIS 
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION 
FOR EXAMPLE REPRESENTING LOCAL 
COUNCILS SAYING WE ARE THE PEOPLE 
WHO MAY HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF WE 
WANT THE MONEY BACK FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT THAT IS A TRICKY ONE TO 
RESOLVE IN THE FUTURE 
IF FIRMS PUT 
THEIR HANDS UP TO THIS AND WE ARE 
HEARING THAT SOME ARE AT LEAST 
DOES THAT REALLY HELP THEM YES YES OUT OF ONE HUNDRED TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN HAVE APPLIED FOR 
LENIENCY THAT MEANS THEY HELD 
THEIR HANDS UP EARLY ON AND ARE CO 
OPERATING ANOTHER FORTY HAVE ADMITTED 
TO TAKING PART IN THIS THE EARLIER 
YOU CO OPERATE THE LOWER THE FINE 
AND SOME MIGHT SAY THAT IS UNFAIR 
BUT WITHOUT THAT SORT OF CO 
OPERATION THE OFT WOULDN'T GET THE 
INFORMATION THEY NEED TO CRACK THIS 
SORT OF PROBLEM LOOK AT THE 
SITUATION WITH B. A. AND VIRGIN ON 
PRICE FIXING ON TRANSATLANTIC 
ROUTES VIRGIN CAME FORWARD AT THE 
BEGINNING AND BLEW THE WHISTLE AND 
THEY GOT A ZERO FINE 
HUGH THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH 
A MEMBER OF GORDON BROWN'S 
GOVERNMENT HAS TOLD COLLEAGUES 
SHE'S GOING RESIGN OVER THE TEN 
PENCE TAX RATE OR RATHER THE 
PROPOSED ABOLITION OF IT ANGELA 
SMITH IS AN AIDE TO THE CHIEF 
SECOND TO THE TREASURY YVETTE 
COOPER GORDON BROWN IS THOUSANDS 
OF MILES IN WASHINGTON WHERE HE HAS 
MET THE THREE REMAINING CANDIDATES 
IN THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE WE 
WILL REPORT ON THAT IN A MOMENT 
FIRST HERE'S NICK ROBINSON WHO HAS 
BEEN WITH MR. BROWN NICK HOW 
SIGNIFICANT WOULD THIS RESIGNATION 
BE 
NOT SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE ANGELA BE SMITH IS A BIG NAME EXCEPT PERHAPS 
IN HER OWN HOUSEHOLD NOT 
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT 
WILL BE ROCKED BY IT NICK BUT IT 
IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE CLUE GLUE 
THAT HELD NEW LABOUR TOGETHER THAT 
EXTRAORDINARY LOYALTY THAT HAS BEEN 
ON SHOW FOR MORE THAN A DECADE NOW 
DOES APPEAR TO BE DEKAIG ANGELA 
SMITH HAS APPARENTLY TOLD HER 
COLLEAGUES SHE FEELS SHE HAS TO GO 
OVER THE SCRAPPING OF THIS TEN 
PENCE TAX RATE ALTHOUGH SHE HAS 
NOT YET FORMALLY RESIGNED AND 
CONFIRMED THAT PUBLICLY IT COMES 
ON THE DAY THAT LORD DESAI SAID 
THIS RATHER BITTER THING ABOUT 
GORDON BROWN HE WAS PUT ON THE 
EARTH TO REMIND PEOPLE HOW GOOD 
TONY BLAIR WAS OUCH 
INDEED NOW DISTRACTION FOR THE 
PRIME MINISTER ON HIS VISIT THERE 
TO WASHINGTON 
WHAT WHILE THE CAT 
IS AWAY THE MICE WILL PLAY NOT 
WELCOME OF COURSE TODAY HUGELY 
IMPORTANT BUSINESS FOR GORDON BROWN 
FRANKLY NICK FOR ALL OF US IN 
BRITAIN AS WELL THE PRIME MINISTER 
IS NOW HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE HE 
ARRIVED IN THIS FLEET OF CARS JUST 
A FEW MINUTES AGO BUT HIS REAL 
MIND TODAY HIS REAL ATTENTION IS 
NOT ON THE TALKS WITH THE CURRENT 
PRESIDENT HE IS NOT LOOKING TO THE 
PAST BUT TO THE FUTURE 
TODAY GORDON BROWN MET THE NEXT 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
THOUGH HE LIKE US DOESN'T KNOW 
YET WHETHER IT WILL BE BARACK OBAMA 
WHO WOULD BE THE FIRST BLACK MAN TO 
HOLD THE JOB OR HIS OLD FRIEND 
HILLARY CLINTON WHO WOULD BE THE 
FIRST WOMAN COMMANDER IN CHIEF OR 
JOHN MCCAIN WHO WOULD BE THE 
OLDEST MAN TO MAKE IT TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE WHOEVER IT IS IT WILL HAVE 
A PROFOUND IMPACT ON HIM AND ON 
BRITAIN BRITAIN I THINK WHAT GORDON BROWN WILL WANT 
TO ESTABLISH AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE 
WITH THE NEW AMERICAN PRESIDENT IS 
A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP 
SIMILAR VIEWS ON THE ISSUES A 
PROPENSITY AND A WILLINGNESS TO 
WORK TOGETHER ON INTERNATIONAL 
PROBLEMS IF YOU CAN THROW IN SOME 
GOOD PERSONAL CHEMISTRY THAT HELPS 
THIS WAS NERVY FIRST DATE FOR 
BARACK OBAMA AND GORDON BROWN THEY 
CHATTED ABOUT CHURCHILL AND IRAQ 
AND THE ECONOMY AS FOR HILLARY 
PERHAPS CHANCE TO DWELL 
ON WHAT ON EARTH HAS GONE WRONG FOR THEM 
BOTH AND WHETHER THEY CAN DO 
ANYTHING TO TURN THINGS AROUND 
JOHN MCCAIN MET THE PRIME MINISTER 
IN LONDON LAST MONTH THOUGH ONE'S 
FROM THE RIGHT AND THE OTHER FROM 
THE LEFT THEY GET ON WELL AND 
SHARE GREAT DEAL IN COMMON 
THE PRIME MINISTER CANNOT DARE SAY 
WHO HE MIGHT WANT TO GET THE JOB 
I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT HAVING 
TALKED TO THE THREE CANDIDATES 
THAT THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES IS STRONG 
SECURE AND VALUED BY ALL OF THEM 
I'M ALSO ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT THAT 
THROUGH WORKING WITH ANY OF THEM WE 
CAN RISE TO THE GREAT CHALLENGES OF 
THE FUTURE 
TONIGHT HE HAS ANOTHER MEETING 
WITH THE CURRENT PRESIDENT AND 
SURELY MUST BE HOPING THAT IT'S 
SOMEWHAT LESS AWKWARD THAN THE 
FIRST TIME THEY MET 
THOUGH GORDON BROWN CAN'T SAY IT 
NOT LEAST WHEN HE IS AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE HE BELIEVES THAT ANY ONE OF 
THOSE THREE CANDIDATES TO REPLACE 
GEORGE BUSH WOULD ACTUALLY RE 
ENGAGE AMERICA WITH THE WORLD AND 
WHETHER IT BE ON CLIMATE CHANGE OR 
TACKLING GLOBAL POVERTY OR DEALING 
WITH THE PROBLEMS IN IRAQ OR 
AFGHANISTAN IT WOULD BE A RATHER 
MORE COMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP THAN 
THE ONE THAT HE HAS DISCOVERED WITH 
THE MAN WHO CURRENTLY OCCUPIES THE 
OVAL OFFICE 
NICK MANY THANKS 
A MAN WHO HECKED THE THEN HOME 
SECRETARY JOHN REID DURING A SPEECH 
HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF TERRORIST 
FUND RAISING AND INCITING TERRORISM 
OVERSEAS THE MUSLIM PREACHING ABU 
IZZADEEN WAS AMONG SIX MEN 
CONVICTED OF A KINGSTON CROWN COURT 
OF TERRORISM RELATED OFFENCES 
IT WAS THE DAY WHEN A HOME 
SECRETARY KNOWN FOR HIS FORTHRIGHT 
MANNER WAS SHOUTED DOWN BY AN 
EXTREMIST EXTREMIST NO TIME FOR DIALOGUE THEY COME IN 
THE MORNING TO YOUR HOUSE THEY ARE 
NOT GOING SAY BISMILLAH ASSALAAM 
ALAIKUM 
THE PROTESTOR WAS ABU ALAIKUM IZZADEEN PREVIOUSLY ANOTHER AS 
TREVOR BROOKS TODAY HE WAS 
CONVICTED OF INVITING TERRORISM 
OVERSEAS AND FUND RAISING FOR 
TERRORISTS 
YOU ARE A TYRANT THE TERRORISTS THE OFFENCES TOOK PLACE AT REGENT'S 
PARK MOSQUE ONE NIGHT IN NOVEMBER 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN FEELINGS WERE RUNNING 
HIGH BECAUSE OF THE FIGHTING IN 
FALLUJAH IN IRAQ IT WAS THE MUSLIM 
HOLY MONTH OF RAMADAN HUNDREDS OF 
WORSHIPPERS WERE ATTENDING THE 
WELL RESPECTED MOSQUE EACH NIGHT 
BUT AMONGST THEM WERE AL GROUP OF 
EXTREMISTS MAKING HATE FILLED 
SPEECHES RIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF THE 
MAIN PRAYER HALL AND FILMING IT ALL 
THE POLICE WON'T RELEASE THE VIDEO 
BUT THE B. B. C. HAS OBTAINED THIS 
FOOTAGE OF ABU IZZADEEN SPEAKING IN 
THE SAME PLACE A FEW DAYS EARLIER 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION MY BROTHERS 
AND SISTERS TERRORISM IS PART AND 
PARCEL OF ISLAM TERRORISM IS PART 
OF THE DEAN OF ISLAM 
TO TERRIFY THE ENEMIES OF ALLARKS 
WE SHOULD PREPARE OURSELF 
HE WAS 
NOT WELCOME AT THE MOSQUE AND 
EVENTUALLY THEY CALLED THE POLICE 
ALSO CONVICTED TODAY SIMON KEELER 
A WHITE CONVERT WHO GREW UP IN 
CRAWLEY AS SIMON KEELER THEY WERE 
FOUND GUILTY OF INCITING TERRORISM 
OR TERRORIST FUND RAISING SHAH 
JILAL HUSSAIN WAS AMONG THE MEN 
CONVICTED BUT TONIGHT HE IS ON THE 
RUN HAVING JUMPED BAIL DURING THE 
TRIAL TRIAL THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER DAVID 
CAMERON SAYS PROMOTING GREEN 
ISSUES AND CRACKING DOWN ON LARGE 
RISES IN TAX BILLS ARE AT THE HEART 
OF HIS PARTY'S POLICIES FOR THE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS IN ENGLAND AND 
WALES ON 
FIRST HE WAS SPEAKING 
AT THE CAMPAIGN LAUNCH AT DEWSBURY 
IN WEST YORKSHIRE WHERE THE TORIES 
RUN KIRKLEES COUNCIL 
WHEN COUNCILS ARE EFFICIENT AND 
WELL RUN THEY SAVE YOU MONEY AND 
THAT'S WHY OUR MESSAGE IN THIS 
LOCAL ELECTION IS SO SIMPLE VOTE 
BLUE GO GREEN AND SAVE MONEY 
THE U. K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY HAS 
LAUNCHED ITS MANIFESTO FOR THE 
LONDON MAYORAL ELECTION ITS 
CANDIDATE HAS SAID THAT IF HE 
BECAME THERE HE WOULD CAMPAIGN FOR 
ISSUES INCLUDING IMMIGRATION AND 
THE CONGESTION CHARGE IF HE 
BECAME MAYOR THIS TIME IT WAS THE 
TURN OF THE INDIAN CAPITAL DELHI 
TO HOST THE PROCESSION OF THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH HERE IS OUR SOUTH 
ASIA CORRESPONDENT 
DESERTED THE OLD IMPERIAL CENTRE 
OF DELHI THE LATEST STOP FOR THE 
GLOBAL OLYMPIC JAMBOREE IT IS NOT 
CLEAR WHO THE CHINESE GODS WERE 
WORRIED ABOUT BECAUSE THERE WAS 
NOBODY WATCHING GUARDS AS FOR 
UNITY THERE WAS NOT MUCH OF THAT 
ON SHOW EITHER IN SMALL GROUPS 
YOUNG TIBETANS TRIED TO BREACH THE 
MASSIVE SECURITY CORDON THERE WAS 
NO WAY THROUGH FIFTEEN THOUSAND POLICE WERE 
GUARDING THE TORCH MANY OF THESE 
YOUNG TIBETANS HAVE SPENT THEIR 
LIVES IN EXILE BORN HERE UNABLE 
TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMELAND THEY 
ARE DETERMINED TO MAKE THEIR VOICES 
HEARD THEY ARE FRUSTRATED AND 
ANGRY THEY SEE THIS TORCH RELAY AS 
THEIR BEST CHANCE OF MAKING THEIR 
POINT SO THE TORCH RELAY IS 
DEGENERATING INTO FARCE ITS ROUTE 
HAS BEEN SHRINKING AS IT HAS 
TRAVELLED AROUND THE WORLD IN 
LONDON IT WAS THIRTEEN MILES IN PARIS 
IN DELHI TIBETANS STAGED THEIR OWN 
ALTERNATIVE TORCH RELAY TODAY MORE 
EXILE'S LIVE HERE THAN IN ANY OTHER 
NATION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ALONG WITH THEIR 
LEADER THE DALAI LAMA EXILES 
YOU DO NOT WANT THE OLYMPICS IN 
CHINA 
NO I DO NOT WANT THEM IN CHINA CHINA THERE WERE MORE SCUFFLES AS 
POLICE TRIED TO SEIZE THE SYMBOLIC 
TIBETAN TORCH 
THE OLYMPIC FLAME 
SHOULD SYMBOLISE PEACE AND UNITY 
THESE TIBETANS SAID CHINA SHOULD 
TALK TO THEIR LEADER IF IT SHOWS 
THOSE IDEALS SHARES THE MAIN 
NEWS TONIGHT THE TEENAGER ACCUSED 
OF MURDERING RHYS JONES APPEARED IN 
COURT TODAY RHYS WERE SHOT DEAD 
WHILE WALKING HOME FROM FOOTBALL 
PRACTICE LAST SUMMER WAS SHOT 
COMING UP WHY THESE TWO YOUNG 
SWIMMERS ARE SET TO MAKE A REAL 
SPLASH IN THE YEARS AHEAD LATER ON 
B. B. C. LONDON CHELSEA'S AVRAM GRANT 
UNDER PRESSURE CAN HE TURN AROUND 
THE CLUB'S PERFORMANCE AND HOLD ON 
TO HIS JOB PLUS THE YOUNG 
OFFENDERS HELPING PENSIONERS 
UNDERSTAND THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF 
THE WEB 
ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE IN 
BRITAIN FEAR THAT RACE RELATIONS 
ARE NOW SO POOR THAT TENSIONS ARE 
LIKELY TO SPILL OVER INTO VIOLENCE 
THAT IS THE FINDING OF A NEW B. B. C. 
POLL COMMISSION ON THE FORTIETH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE RIVERS OF 
BLOOD SPEECH MADE BY ENOCH POWELL 
SIX OUT OF TEN OF THOSE POLLED THINK 
THERE ARE TOO MANY IMMIGRANTS IN 
BRITAIN AND HALF BELIEVE THE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD ENCOURAGE 
FOREIGNERS TO LEAVE BRITAIN HAS 
WITNESSED A DECADE OF RECORD 
IMMIGRATION A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 
NOTABLE PERHAPS FOR THE LACK OF 
HOSTILITY AND PUBLIC OPPOSITION 
BUT TODAY'S B. B. C. POLL SUGGESTS 
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED THAT RACE 
RELATIONS MAY BE GETTING STRAINED 
WE ASKED ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY WHETHER THEY THOUGHT THERE 
WAS ANY TENSION BETWEEN PEOPLE OF 
DIFFERENT RACES AND NATIONALITIES 
THREE IN FOUR SAID THEY THOUGHT 
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OR A FAIR 
AMOUNT AMOUNT DID THEY THINK THAT TENSION WOULD 
RESULT IN VIOLENCE ALMOST TWO 
THIRDS FEARED IT WAS EITHER CERTAIN 
OR LIKELY TO DO SO 
WHAT'S NOT CLEAR IS WHETHER PEOPLE 
ARE IMAGINING THE KIND OF RACE 
RIOTS WE SAW IN SOME NORTHERN TOWNS 
SEVEN YEARS AGO OR JUST A BIT OF 
ARGY BARGY ON A SATURDAY NIGHT N. D. THE RESENTMENT LIE NOT WITH 
THE IMMIGRANT POPULATION BUT WITH 
THOSE AMONG WHOM THEY HAVE COME 
AND ARE STILL COMING 
FORTY YEARS AFTER ENOCH POWELL WARNED 
OF SERIOUS UNREST IF IMMIGRATION 
WAS LEFT UNCHECKED THERE IS IT 
SEEMS STILL DEEP PUBLIC ANXIETY 
ABOUT ITS CONSEQUENCES 
WHAT WORRIES ME IS IF THAT FRICTION 
STARTS TO CATCH FIRE AND IF PEOPLE 
DO GENUINELY BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO 
CATCH FIRE THEN WE ARE IN TROUBLE 
I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK THIS 
FINDING MAY REFLECT NOT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING TODAY BUT THE STORY THAT 
HAS BEEN TOLD OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS 
THAT IS IF YOU GET PEOPLE OF 
DIFFERENT KINDS TOGETHER THEN 
EVENTUALLY THERE IS GOING TO BE 
TROUBLE 
HOWEVER ELSEWHERE IN OUR POLL 
SIGNS THAT RACIAL 
PREJUDICE MAY BE 
DECLINING IN BRITAIN TWENTY PER CENT ADMIT TO 
FEELINGS OF PREJUDICE DOWN FROM 
TWENTY FOUR PER CENT THREE YEARS AGO AND THE LOWEST 
SCORE EVER RECORDED TO THE QUESTION 
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF RACE IT SEEMS 
IT IS THE LEVEL OF IMMIGRATION THAT 
PEOPLE ARE UNSURE ABOUT A QUARTER 
SAID THEIR LOCAL AREA DIDN'T FEEL 
LIKE BRITAIN ANYMORE DOUBLE THE 
PROPORTION RECORDED JUST THREE 
YEARS AGO SIX OUT OF TEN SAID 
THERE ARE TOO MANY IMMIGRANTS IN 
BRITAIN AND HALF THOUGHT GOVERNMENT 
SHOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO RETURN TO 
THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN IN 
WHITEHALL A TEAM OF OFFICIALS IS 
MONITORING RACIAL TENSION AROUND 
THE COUNTRY WITH MINISTERS 
ACCEPTING THAT THE CHURN AND 
CHANGE ASSOCIATED WITH RECORD 
IMMIGRATION IS LEADING TO PROBLEMS 
BUT THEY INSIST SOCIAL COHESION 
REMAINS STRONG AL FACTOR THAT WILL 
BE CRUCIAL IN DECIDING WHETHER 
PEOPLE'S FEARS BECOME REALITY 
A SHOPKEEPER HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
THE MOMENT HE FOUGHT OFF A MASKED 
ROBBER WHO FIRED A CROSSBOW AT HIM 
MOHAMMED RAZAQ FROM STOCKTON ON 
TEESSIDE FOUGHT OFF THE MAN WITH A 
WOODEN POLE FROM HIS SHUTTERS THE 
ATTACK WAS CAUGHT ON C. C. T. V. 
THIS REMARKABLE FOOTAGE SHOWS A 
DARING AND POTENTIALLY LETHAL 
ROBBERY A YOUNG MAN ARMED WITH A 
CROSSBOW IS SEARCHING FOR MONEY 
THE ATTACKER HAD ONLY BEEN IN THE 
SHOP FOR A FEW SECONDS BUT HE 
TRIED TO GET INTO THE TILL AND 
THAT WAS HIS MISTAKE BECAUSE HE 
PRESSED THE WRONG BUTTON SETTING 
OFF THE ALARM THE SHOPKEEPER 
MOHAMMED RAZAQ BURST INTO THE 
STORE AND QUICKLY FOUND HIS LIFE 
IN DANGER 
I WAS RIGHT HERE LESS THAN TWO F. T. 
DISTANT HE REALLY THREATENED ME 
THAT TIME HE ASKED ME TO GO INTO 
THE TILL GET THE MONEY OUT AND 
PUT IT INTO HIS BACK L. DECIDED TO 
GO BEHIND HERE 
FEARING HIS YOUNG 
FAMILY NEXT DOOR MAY BE IN DANGER 
HE DECIDED TO DEFEND HIMSELF HE 
GRABBED A POLE AND CHASED THE 
ATTACKER AWAY 
AN ISOLATED MAN IN A SHOP ON HIS 
OWN BUT I MUST ADD THAT THIS TYPE 
OF CRIME IS VERY RARE 
THE FAMILY 
REMAIN SHOCKED BY THE INCIDENT BUT 
THEY SAY IT IS THE ONLY TROUBLE 
THEY HAVE KNOWN IN THE TOWN IN MORE 
THAN EIGHTEEN YEARS 
MARTIN JOHNSON ENGLAND'S NEW RUGBY 
MANAGER HAS SPOKEN ABOUT HIS NEW 
JOB FOR THE FIRST TIME HE SAYS HE

NEWS CONFERENCE 
THERE IS HUGE AMOUNT OF 
RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS JOB IT 
NEEDS TO BE DONE WELL L. AM LOOKING 
FORWARD TO GETTING INTO IT AND 
TRYING TO DO AL GOOD JOB THERE IS 
NO POINT PUTTING YOURSELF ON THE

WE JUST NEED TO GET ON WITH THE JOB 
I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT IT WE JUST 
NEED TO GET ON WITH IT 
THE ZIMBABWEAN OPPOSITION LEADER 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS CALLED FOR 
THE PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI TO BE 
RELIEVED OF HIS DUTIES AS A

ZIMBABWE NEARLY THREE WEEKS AGO 
HAVE STILL NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED 
TWO YOUNG SISTERS TIPPED AS FUTURE 
OLYMPIANS ARE CAUSING A BIG SPLASH 
IN SOUTH WALES GEORGIA DAVIES AND 
HER SEVEN YEAR OLD SISTER KUC 
ERROR HAVE BECOME THE YOUNGEST IN 
BRITAIN TO ARRAM LONG DISTANCE 
SWIMMING CERTIFICATES HER SISTER 
KIANNA WE WENT TO MEET THE POOL 
PRODIGIES THE TERM WATER BABIES 
WAS SURELY INVENTED FOR THESE TWO 
GEORGIA AND KIANNA HAVE BEEN 
SWIMMING EVER SINCE THEIR DAD PUT 
THEM INTO A POOL THEY LOVE THE 
WATER AND HAVE JUST SWUM THREE 
KILOMETRES AND FOUR KILOMETRES 
RESPECTIVELY THE YOUNGEST IN THE 
COUNTRY TO ACHIEVE SUCH A FEAT 
IT WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY AND T. WAS HARD THE THE GIRLS ARE QUITE A FIXTURE AT THEIR 
LOCAL POOL THEY SWIM HERE SEVERAL 
TIMES A WEEK WITH THEIR ELDER 
BROTHER AND SISTER UNDER THE 
WATCHFUL EYE AND GUIDANCE OF THAT 
HE IS WARY NOT TO PUSH THEM AT SUCH 
A YOUNG AGE BUT KNOWS THAT WITH 
SUCH TALENT AND THE RIGHT HELP 
THEY COULD GO A LONG WAY 
IT WOULD 
BE NICE IF THEY DID IT INTO THE 
OLYMPICS FOR BRITAIN BUT I THINK 
IT IS A BIT TOO DIFFICULT FOR US TO 
DO THAT BECAUSE WE ARE SO FAR FROM 
AN OLYMPIC POOL AT THIS MOMENT IN IN AN OLYMPIC YEAR BRITISH WOMEN IS 
IN GOOD SHAPE DAVID DAVIES WAS ONE 
OF TWENTY FOUR MEDALLISTS FROM BRITAIN AT 
LAST YEAR'S WORLD SHORT COURSE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS HE DID NOT START 
SERIOUS SWIMMING AND TO WIN INTO 
HIS TEENS HE IS AMAZED BY WHAT THE 
GIRLS HAVE DONE UNTIL WELL INTO 
HIS TEENS 
I HOPE THEY CAN INSPIRE 
MORE YOUNGSTERS TO GET INTO 
SWIMMING THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL 
ABOUT BUT FOR THEM AT THE MOMENT 
I WOULD JUST TELL THEM TO JUST 
ENJOY IT NOT TO PUT ANY PRESSURE 
ON THEMSELVES 
THESE GIRLS ARE SO 
YOUNG THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS CANNOT BE 
OFFICIALLY RECORDED NEVER MIND THE 
REGIME OLYMPICS THEY WILL BE TOO 
YOUNG EVEN TO COMPETE AT THE LONDON 
OLYMPICS IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHATEVER THE 
FUTURE FOR GEORGIA AND KUC ERROR IN 
THE POOL THEY HAVE GOT SEVERAL 
YEARS OF SCHOOL TO GET THROUGH 
FIRST GEORGETTE AND KIANNA NOW
