GOOD AFTERNOON IT IS THE ECONOMY 
STUPID GLOOM OVER HOUSE PRICES HE 
IS MEETING THE BANKERS TO GET THEM 
TO PASS ON THE RATE CUT AND THE 
TILLS ARE GOING QUIET 
IS THERE 
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT YOUR 
MONEY HOW GRIM IT IS GETTING FOR 
THE POOR ESTATE AGENTS EVERY EVERY LITTLE HELPS SO THE TWO POINT EIGHT SHOULD 
HELP A LOT TESCO'S LATEST RESULTS 
AND I WILL FIND OUT WHAT THE 
CHANGES IN BIOFUELS MEAN 
THERE ARE 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND 
TODAY THERE HAS BEEN A BIG CLOUD OF 
FIGURES THAT OFFER AN INSIGHT 
THERE HAS BEEN TALK OF A PERFECT 
STORM ARRIVING RG IN WHICH RISING 
PRICES AND FALLING SALES COMBINE TO 
CAUSE PROBLEMS SO WHAT IS THE 
OUTLOOK OVER TO OUR OUTLOOK 
CORRESPONDENT SALES ARE DOWN 
HOUSE PRICES ARE FALLING AND THERE 
ARE FEARS THAT INFLATION COULD BE 
ON THE SIZE RISE IN OTHER WORDS 
THE ECONOMY IS IN FOR A BIT OF A 
ROUGH TIME BACK TO THE STUDIO 
THANK YOU AS THE MAN SAID HOUSE 
PRICES ARE NOT ONLY FALLING 
ACCORDING TO THE ROYAL INSTITUTION 
OF CHARTERED SURVEYORS THERE ARE 
MORE SURVEYORS SAYING THE PRICES 
ARE FALLING THAN NEVER BEFORE THEY 
SHOW SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT SAY PRICES HAVE DROPPED 
THAT IS A BIG JUMP FROM FEBRUARY 
WHEN THAT FIGURE WAS AROUND SIXTY FIVE PER CENT 
WHEN THAT FIGURE WAS AROUND SIXTY FIVE PER CENT THAT IS NOT ALL THE BRITISH RETAIL 
CONSORTIUM HAS THIS MORNING 
REVEALED SALES FIGURES FOR MARCH 
THEY SHOW THE FIRST FALL IN MARCH 
SALES FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS SALES 
CLAIM BY SIXTEEN PER CENT THAT MAY NOT JUST BE 
DOWN TO WORRIES ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
IT COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR 
WEATHER WE HAVE BEEN SEEING AND IT 
COULD BE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT 
IT COULD BE PEOPLE ARE SAVING MORE 
AND THAT COULD BE A GOOD THING 
INFLATION FIGURES CAME OUT TODAY 
SHOWING THEY WERE AT LEAST WELL 
THEY WERE HELD STEADY AT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT BUT 
THERE ARE FEARS THAT INFLATION 
GENERALLY COULD RISE AND VARIOUS 
EXPERTS CLAIM THAT MOST OF THEM 
BELIEVE THAT INFLATION AS MEASURED 
BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX COULD 
RISE FROM TWENTY FIVE PER CENT TO TWENTY SIX PER CENT THIS MONTH 
THE OFFICIAL TARGET IS TWO PER CENT SO WE 
ARE WELL ABOVE THAT WHILE THIS IS 
HAPPENING THE BANK OF ENGLAND CUT 
INTEREST RATES BUT BANKS ARE NOT 
PASSING THAT ON TO CUSTOMERS SO 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS INVITED BANK 
BOSSES TO NO TEN FOR A SANDWICH AND 
A CHAT HE IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON 
THEM TO PASS ON THE CUTS WHILE HE 
IS BUTTERING THE BREAD FOR HIS 
GUESTS HE TOOK TIME TO MAKE A PLEA 
TO OIL 
COUNTRIES 
TO 
INCREASE PRODUCTION TO KEEP PRICES 
STABLE SO A RISE IN ENERGY COSTS 
DOES NOT MAKE THINGS EVEN WORSE 
THAN THEY ARE NOW SO YOU COULD BE 
FORGIVEN FOR THINKING IT IS TIME TO 
PANIC SO IS IT TIME TO 
PANIC 
PANIC SO IS IT TIME TO PANIC FRPBGS NO BUT WE ARE IN FOR 
GLOOMY FEW MONTHS SPENDING COULD 
HAVE BEEN STRONGER THAN WE HAVE 
BEEN EXPECTING BUT THE CREDIT 
MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE TIGHTENED 
DRAMATICALLY T. SITUATION HAS GONE 
ON FOR LONGER THAN MANY OF US 
THOUGHT IT WOULD DO THAT WILL FEED 
THROUGH AND WE WILL SEE WEEK 
WEAK DETAY ON RETAIL SALES EVEN 
THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE BEING SOULGT 
TO THE CREDIT CRISIS I THINK ARE 
GOING TO ONLY COME INTO EFFECT AT 
BEST TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR 
MAYBE IN THE SECOND OR THIRD 
QUARTERS WE WILL SEE A CONTINUATION 
OF GLOOMY DATA 
AS OUR ECONOMIC 
WEATHERMAN SAID HOUSE PRICES ARE A 
KEY PART OF THE CREDIT EQUATION 
ESTATE AGENTS DON'T TEND TO GET A 
GOOD PRESS BUT WHEN THEY ARE DOING 
WELL HOME OWNERS TEND TO DO WELL 
WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BUYING 
HOUSES IS FALLING AND ESTATE AGENTS 
ARE SUFFERING TODAY WE HAVE HEARD 
THE NEWS THAT THE WELSH FIRM 
DARLOWS IS CLOSING THREE OF ITS 
OFFICES ARE ESTATE AGENTS FACING A 
GRIM FUTURE WE HAVE BEEN TO SEE A 
LEADING AGENT WHO THINKS THOUSANDS 
OF BRANCHES WILL CLOSE IT IS AN 
ESTATE AGENCY IN A WELL OFF PART OF 
BUCKINGHAMSHIRE THAT WAS FOUNDED IN 
NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE SO IT HAS SURVIVED TWO 
PROPERTY CRASHES THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF ESTATE AGENTS DURING 
THE NINETEEN NINETIES RECESSION HE REMEMBERS 
NEAR LAY THIRD OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND BRANCHES 
AT THE TIME HAD TO BE CLOSED HE 
EXPECTS IT WILL BE ALMOST AS BAD 
THIS TIME 
HAVING A MIND TO MY 
EXPERIENCE IN THE NINETIES I 
WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF PRESSURE 
WAS NOT ONLY ABOUT THREE AND A HALF 
TO FOUR ESTATE AGENTS 
ALMOST AS 
MANY CLOSED IN THE PREVIOUS 
RECESSION 
YES WE LOST FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED WE RECESSION BELIEVE LAST TIME L. THINK IT WOULD 
BE A FEWER THIS TIME WE ARE LANER 
AND MANEER LEANER AND MEANER 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD 
EXPERIENCE OF THE PREVIOUS CRASH 
AND CAN REACT 
WHAT ARE THE SIGNS 
THAT YOU ARE SEEING THAT MAKE YOU 
SO WORRIED ABOUT THE SITUATION 
W. ELL IT IS OBVIOUS THAT STAFF ARE 
BEING LAID OFF IN DROVES I'M 
RECEIVING OFFERS FROM EMPLOYMENT 
AGENCIES FROM EMPLOYEES DIRECT 
EVERY DAY ASKING IF I WOULD LIKE 
TO CONSIDER THEM AS A MEMBER OF MY 
STAFF SO CLEARLY THEY BEING LAID 
OFF THIS IS ALWAYS A PRECURSOR TO 
OFFICE CLOSURES 
I GUESS THAT 
AGENTS WILL SAY WE ARE GOING TO 
BRAZEN IT OUT WE WILL CUT 
EXPENDITURE AND IT MAY ONLY BE A 
FEW MONTHS AND WE SHOULD BE ALL 
RIGHT 
OF COURSE THEY WILL SOME RIGHT WILL BE ABLE TO COPE THEY WILL NOT 
HAVE THE LEVEL OF EXPENSES THAT 
SOME OF THEIR COMPETITORS AND THEY 
CAN TIGHTEN THEIR BELT AND THEY 
WELL KNOW THEY WAY AROUND THE 
MARKET IN A DIFFICULT PERIOD AND BE 
ABLE TO WORK IT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE 
IT IS COMMON FOR HOUSES TO BE 
DISCOUNTED BY FIFTEEN PER CENT FROM THEIR ASKING 
PRICES AND MEANWHILE SURVEYORS ARE 
GIVING PESSIMISTIC VALUATIONS 
WHICH SLOWS DOWN MORTGAGE 
APPLICATIONS THE MOST WORRYING 
THING FOR THE AGENTS IS THAT SO 
LITTLE PROPERTY IS SELLING THE 
RESULT IS THEIR FEE INCOME WILL 
PLUMMET WITH ME WE HEARD AND WE 
HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS SO CALLED 
PERFECT STORM ARE ALL AGENTS ALL 
AT SEA 
IT IS A WORRYING SITUATION 
IF YOU CONSIDER THERE MUST BE 
FORTY THOUSAND OR SO AGENTS ON THE FRONT 
LINE INVOLVED IN BUYING AND 
SELLING HOUSES IF YOU HAD THREE THOUSAND 
OFFICES CLOSING THAT MIGHT MEAN UP 
TO TEN THOUSAND OF THOSE JOBS WOULD BE 
UNDER THREAT IT IS A SERIOUS 
SITUATION BUT A LOT OF AGENTS 
COULD CAUTIOUS AGAINST BEING 
PESSIMISTIC PARTICULARLY THE 
CURRENT HEAD OF THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF ESTATE AGENTS PETER 
BOLTON KING HE SAYS IT IS NOT JUST 
THROUGH RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY SALES 
THAT THE AGENTS ARE MAKING THEIR 
MONEY 
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT A MONEY LOT OF AGENTS DON'T JUST RELY ON 
RESIDENTIAL SALES THEY COULD HAVE 
LETTINGS THEY COULD HAVE 
COMMERCIAL THEY COULD HAVE 
SURVEYING THE OLD ESTABLISHED 
FIRMS TENDS TO FINDS THE SEAMS HAVE 
SLOWED UP BUT AT THE MOMENT THE 
RESIDENTIAL LETTING SECTOR IS 
STRONG 
A LOT WILL DEPEND ON HOW STRONG LONG THE CURRENT CRISIS LASTS 
SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN IT IS A 
QUESTION OF THE EXTENTS BUT ONE 
THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS HOW THE 
ESTATE AGENTS WILL TRY TO EARN MORE 
FEES IF THEY NOT GETTING ANYTHING 
COMING IN THEY WILL HAVE TO THINK 
OF ANOTHER WAY ONE THING ABOUT THE 
BUSINESS IS THAT THEY WILL TAKE ON 
YOUR PROPERTY AND THEY WON'T GET 
THEIR FEE FROM YOU UNTIL WHEN IT IS 
SOLD THEY ARE WORRIED THAT 
PROPERTIES ARE PEOPLE WON'T 
ACTUALLY IT WON'T YIELD A FEE FROM 
THEM SO THINK PERHAPS OF 
REGISTRATION FEES FROM ESTATE 
AGENTS IF THEY CAN MAY THEY 
CHARGE YOU WHEN YOU BRING THE 
PROPERTY TO THEM THEY HAVE LEARNED 
THAT YOU ARE PREPARED TO PAY FOR A 
HOME INFORMATION PACK PERHAPS THEY 
WILL TRY AN EXTRA CHARGE NOW 
BECAUSE THEY ARE DESPERATE 
A GOOD 
TIME TO GET A DEAL FROM THEM THANK 
YOU WITH A LOT OF DOOM AND GLOOM 
AROUND IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO 
TO PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST THIS 
CHRISTINE ROSS IS HEAD OF FINANCIAL 
PLANNING AT S. G. P. HAMBROS CAN YOU 
SHED ANY LIGHT AROUND TODAY ARE 
THERE THINGS WE CAN DO TO PROTECT 
OURSELVES 
WELL YES BUT IT DEPENDS OURSELVES WHETHER WE ARE SAVERS OF BOARERS 
WHY NOT BORROWERS 
FOR SAVERS 
WITH INTEREST RATES WHERE THEY ARE 
IT IS NOT JUST THE BANK RATE THAT 
MATTER BUT THE RATES THAT BANKS 
CAN BORROW FROM ONE ANOTHER THAT 
IS THE INTER BANK RATE SAVERS 
COULD MANIPULATE THAT A LURCH SUM 
OF FIFTY THOUSAND OR MORE IF YOU GO TO 
YOUR BANK AND SAY I WANT A MONEY 
MARKET DEPOSIT IT COULD BE AT RATES 
HIGHER THAN THE FEW FIVE PER CENT BANK BASE 
RATE THESE RATES HAVE BEEN UP TO 
NEARLY FIFTY NINE THOSE WITH LARGER SUMS 
MAYBE HAVE SOLD HOUSES AND ARE 
WAITING TO BUY ANOTHER ONE THAT 
LARGE LUMP SUM COULD EARN A BETTER 
RATE OVER A SHORTER TERM WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE FLIP SIDE THE BORROWERS 
VERY DIFFICULT THERE IS AN 
ARGUMENT THAT VARIABLE RATES COULD 
BE A BETTER DEAL ONE MORTGAGE 
BROKER SAID TO ME THAT SOME LENDERS 
WERE PUTTING UP HIGHER RATES BEFORE 
A RATE CUT AND THEN CUTTING THEM 
NOW WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS THE 
CASE BUT WE ARE NOT SEEING RATES 
COME DOWN FOR BOAR ROARS AND ALSO 
THE WAY LENDERS ARE SCRUTINISING 
YOUR CREDIT HISTORY IS DIFFERENT TO 
THAT WE HAVE KNOWN IN RECENT TIMES 
WE ARE BACK TO LOWER MULTIPLES OF 
INCOME LOWER BONUSES IF THEY ARE 
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT YOU HAVE TO 
HAVE A CLEAN CREDIT HISTORY TO GET 
A GOOD DEAL THEY WANT TO SEE A 
BIGGER DEPOSIT NOT JUST FIVE PER CENT THEY 
ARE LOOKING AT PEOPLE HAVING TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
TO GET THE BETTER DEALS MOST MOST PEOPLE WON'T HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND TO INVEST 
WHAT ABOUT MORE MUNDANE STRATEGYS 
TO PROTECT YOUR FEW HUNDRED OR FEW 
THOUSAND POUNDS ARE YOU SAYING 
JUST PLAY SAFE AND CHUCK IT IN A 
BANK WHAT STRATEGIES CAN PEOPLE 
ADOPT 
ONE OF THE BEST IF YOU ARE ADOPT WILLING TO NOT WALK INTO A HIGH 
STREET BRANCH IS TO USE PHONE 
OPERATING AND INTERNET OPERATED 
BANK ACCOUNTS THE MONEY FACTS WEB 
SITE LISTS THE BEST DEALS IF YOU 
GIVE NOTICE ON YOUR MONEY OR 
OPERATE NOT THROUGH A BRANCH YOU 
WILL SQUEEZE THAT BETTER INTEREST 
RATE THAT DOES ADD UP IN THE LONG 
RUN 
HOW WORRIED ARE YOU 
IN THE RUN SHORT TERM IT IS NOT GOOD NEWS 
ONCE WE SEE THE YEAR OUT IT IS NOT 
DOOM AND GLOOM FOR THOSE WILLING 
TO TAKE A CHANCE IT COULD BE 
BUYING OPPORTUNITY 
THANK YOU NOW 
LET'S LOOK AT THE MARKETS 
BUYING OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU NOW LET'S LOOK AT THE MARKETS 
DESPITE 
THESE WORRIES ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
THAT GIANT OF ALL THINGS SHOPPING 
TESCO HAS REPORTED A GOOD SET OF 
FIGURES ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT 
THIS COMPANY HAS DONE WELL GROUP 
SALES GREW ELEVEN PER CENT AND THERE WAS A 
VERY SUBSTANTIAL RISE IN ONLINE AND 
INTERNET SALES ALL OF THAT HAS 
DRIVEN PRE TAX 
PROFITS TO TWO EIGHT FORTY SIX 
DRIVEN PRE TAX PROFITS TO TWO EIGHT FORTY SIX MILLION THAT IS UP A VERY 
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT IT IS UP GOING 
ON TWELVE PER CENT AGAINST A BACKGROUND WHERE 
RETAILERS ARE HAVING DIFFICULT 
TIMES SO WHAT IS THE SECRET OF 
RUNNING A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IN 
DIFFICULT TIMES HERE IS THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OF TESCOS 
DIFFICULT TIMES HERE IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF TESCOS 
LOOKING AT THE 
CONSUMER IN THE U. K. THEY ARE 
CONCERNED THEY ARE GLOOMIER ABOUT 
THE PROSPECTS FOR THE YEAR AHEAD 
SO THE IMPORTANT THING FOR ANY 
BUSINESS IS MAKE SURE THEY 
UNDERSTAND THE PREB YUSH 
PRESSURE THE CONSUMER IS UNDER AND 
RESPOND AND HELP THEM OUT WITH 
BETTER PRODUCTS AND PRICES IF THEY 
DO THAT THEY WILL BE REWARDED BY 
THE CONSUMER THERE ARE 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES IN 
THIS MARKET AS WELL AS THREATS 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES IN THIS MARKET AS WELL AS THREATS 
NOW 
THIS MARKET AS WELL AS THREATS NOW SHARES TESCO IS DOING VERY WELL 
SIX PER CENT UP THE WHOLE OF THE SUPERMARKET 
SECTOR IS NOT DOING BADLY BUT THIS 
IS A DIFFERENT STORY THIS IS THE 
CHANGE OVER THE YEAR SAINCE WHICH 
ARE 
SAINSBURY HAS LOST A 
THIRD OF ITS VALUE WHERE IS TESCO 
IT IS THE BEST PERFORMER BUT THAT 
ONLY BECAUSE UNITED LOST ONLY NINE PER CENT OF 
ITS VALUE THAT DOES SET THE 
CONTEXT 
IT WAS A BIT OF A MIXED DAY FOR 
WIDELY HEAD SHARES B. A. DOWN AND IT 
WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE TREK TO OF 
CUSTOMERS SERVICES AND HEAD OF 
OPERATIONS WILL BE LEAVING THE 
COMPANY AND THEY'LL HAVE A CHIEF 
OPERATIONS OFFICER TO COMBINE BOTH 
THOSE ROLES THE DEPARTURE IS AFTER 
TERMINAL FIVE AND THE PROBLEMS CAUSED 
BY THAT MOVE 
DEBENHAMS REPORTED FIRST HALF PRE 
TAX PROFITS OF NINETY FOUR MILLION THEY 
WERE DOWN TWELVE PER CENT TRADING CONDITIONS 
EXPECTED TO REMAIN CHALLENGING 
THEY SAY 
CARPHONE WAREHOUSE AND THE MOBILE 
PHONE SUBSCRIBER NUMBERS INCREASED 
TWELVE PER CENT DESPITE THE PROBLEMS YET YOU'D 
THINK THAT WAS GOOD NEWS BUT IT 
WASN'T AS GOOD AS EXPECTED AND AS A 
RESULT WE'VE SEEN THEIR SHARES FALL 
DOWN ALMOST TEN PER CENT 
THE BIGGEST GAIN CAME FROM THE 
PHARMACEUTICAL GROUP ASTRAZENECA 
AFTER IT CAME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH 
INDIA'S RANBAXY LABORATORIES TO END 
A LAWSUIT FOR PATENT FOR A DRUG 
AND THE LAST ONE J. D. SPORTS DOUBLED 
FULL YEAR PROFIT BUT CAUTIOUS ABOUT 
THE OUTLOOK 
THE BANKS HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH 
THE PRIME MINISTER OBVIOUSLY AND 
WE HAVE HEY HEARD FROM NUMBER TEN 
THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS TODAY 
INJECTING AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN BILLION 
INTO THE MARKET IT'S MEANT TO MAKE 
LENDING BETWEEN THE BANKS EASIER 
AND EASE THE CREDIT CRUNCH IF 
THEY'RE MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT 
LENDING TO EACH OTHER THE IDEA IS 
THAT THEY'LL BE MORE CONFIDENT 
ABOUT LENDING TO US THAT'S THE 
HOPE T. HASN'T HAD AN EFFECT ON THE 
MARKETS THE F. T. S. E. IS UP FIFTY FIVE ALMOST 
ONE PER CENT 
ONE PER CENT ONE PER CENT FROM TODAY MORE OF THE FUEL WE USE 
IN OUR CARS HAS TO BE MADE FROM SO 
CALLED BIOFUELS 
GOOD NEWS YOU SAY AND IT'S A 
GOVERNMENT IDEA BUT IT'S CAUSED 
SOME CONTROVERSY WITH 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS WHO BELIEVE WE 
SHOULD GROW THINGS FOR FOOD NOT 
CAR FUEL BUT BRITAIN'S BIGGEST 
BIO FUEL COMPANY ARGENT ENERGY 
MAKES ITS DIESEL FROM ANIMAL FAT 
AND COOKING OIL WE SENT ROB ALONG 
TO FIND OUT HOW THEY DO IT 
THIS IS THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST 
PRODUCER BIODIESEL FUELS I'M AT A 
FIRM CALLED ARGENT JUST OUTSIDE 
MOTHERWELL IN SCOTLAND THEY TAKE 
WASTE COOKING OIL FROM FISH AND 
CHIP SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS FROM ALL 
OVER THE COUNTRY THEY TAKE WASTE 
ANIMAL PRODUCTS FROM PLACES LIKE 
ABATTOIRS AND BUTCHERS WHICH MEANS 
A THINGS LIKE A COW ON A FIELD 
COULD POWER YOUR CAR THEY TURN IT 
INTO BIODIESEL FUEL JIM IS THE 
OPERATIONS OFFICER HEERPL HOW DO 
YOU OPERATE HERE 
WE BRING IN ABOUT 
THIRTY THOUSAND TONNES OF USED COOKING OIL 
FROM THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND 
SCOTLAND AND ANIMAL FATS FROM 
SCOTLAND AND TURN IT INTO BIODIESEL 
THROUGH THE PROCESS INSIDE THAT 
BUILDING WHICH IS A UNIQUE PROCESS 
TO THIS PLANT AND ONE OR TWO OTHERS 
IN EUROPE THIS IS THE BIGGEST 
PLANT IN THE U. K. 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
ARGUMENTS WE'RE HEARING AT THE 
MOMENT IS THAT IT'S NOT AS 
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY OR GREEN 
AS PEOPLE MAKE OUT 
THERE IS 
VARIOUS DEGREES OF SUSTAINABILITY 
AND FRIENDLY FRIENDLY FUELS THIS 
IS THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY 
FRIENDLY BECAUSE WE'RE EFFECTIVELY 
RECYCLING WASTE FROM OUR EVERY DAY 
LIVES PEOPLE CAN COLLECT USING 
FROM CHIP PANS AT HOME FROM 
CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS AND 
RESTAURANTS AND YOUR EVERY DAY 
THROW AWAY PIECES OF MEAT FROM 
ABATTOIRS NORM LITTLE IT WOULD BE 
LAND FILLED NOW IT'S BEING TURNED 
INTO FUEL 
HEAD TO THE CONTROL ROOM 
THIS IS THE HEART OF THE OPERATION 
THE PROCESS IS CONTROLLED BY THESE 
FOUR SCREENS IT'S GOT TODAY'S 
SCOTT TODAY IS ON SHIFT WE HAVE 
EVERY PART OF THE PLANT HERE HOW HOW DOES IT WORK WHAT DO YOU DO TO IT 
WHEN IT GETS INTO THOSE TANKS EACH EACH PART OF THE PROCESS IS SHOWN UP IN 
THIS COMPUTER SYSTEM SO FOR 
EXAMPLE AT THE MOMENT WE'RE 
PROCESSING THIS AND IT'S RUN AT SEVENTY 
TONNES AN HOUR THAT SHOWS WE'RE 
PRODUCING SIXTY FIVE TONNES OF BIODIESEL 
READY TO GO IN YOUR CAR BUS OR 
LORRY 
JIM KNOWS HIS BIO FUEL BUT LORRY HE'S ALSO A FARMER IN FACT PART OF 
THE OPERATION IS PART OF THE ARGENT 
GROUP A FOOD PROCESSING FOOD WHO 
LOOKED INTO BIOFUELS 
TURNING ANIMAL WASTE AND CARCASSES 
INTO FUEL WAS A SURPRISING CHOICE 
BUT IT'S A VIABLE BUSINESS 
THIS IS 
USED COOKING OIL PICKED UP FROM 
ACROSS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND 
SCOTLAND FROM VARIOUS CHIP SHOPS 
THIS IS TWO TYPES OF TALLO THIS IS 
WHAT YOU WOULD EFFECTIVELY KNOW AS 
LARD THIS WOULD COME FROM A CHIP 
SHOP OR THE REMAINS OF ABATTOIRS 
AND OTHER SUCH ESTABLISHMENTS FROM 
THAT IT GOES THROUGH A PROCESS 
BEFORE IT'S DISTILLED THIS IS THE 
CRUDE BIO DIESEL BEFORE IT'S 
DISTILLED TO ALLOW TO GO INTO THE 
ENGINE ONCE WE PUT IT THROUGH OUR 
COLUMNS IT SPLITS INTO TWO PRODUCT 
THIS TO POWER OUR BOILER AND THIS 
IS THE STUFF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IN 
YOUR ENGINES BEAUTIFUL CLEAR 
DIESEL THAT COULD GO STRAIGHT INTO 
A CAR OR LORRY RIGHT NOW THE THE FIRM'S BIGGEST CUSTOMER IS SHELL 
WHICH TAKES THE BIODIESEL TO MIX 
WITH ITS FUEL OVER IN KILMARNOCK 
THE STAGECOACH COMPANY IS 
EXPERIMENTING BY RUNNING SOME OF 
ITS FLEET ENTIRELY ON BIODIESEL 
PASSENGERS SEEM TO LIKE IT HAVE HAVE YOU HAD TO DO MUCH TO MODIFY THE 
BUSES 
VERY LITTLE DUAL TANK BUSES SYSTEM AND THAT'S IT 
I GATHER YOU 
HAVE TO KEEP THE FUEL WARM BECAUSE 
IT CAN SOLIDIFY 
YEAH WE START OFF 
ON ORDINARY DIESEL FOR A FEW 
MINUTES IN THE MORNING SWITCH TO 
BIO AND THEN IT RUNS LIKE THAT ONCE 
IT'SS REACHED ITS TEMPERATURE 
STAGECOACH IS OFFERING CUSTOMERS 
TKPH IN KILMARNOCK DISCOUNCILED 
TICKETS IF THEY BRING THEIR COOKING 
OIL ARGENT WANTS TO SEE COOKING OIL 
COLLECTED AS RECYCLING IS DONE AT 
THE MOMENT 
WILL IT MEAN HIGHER PRICES 
NO THE 
PRICES WON'T RISE AT THE PUMPS 
BECAUSE THERE'S A DUTY REBATE AT 
THE MOMENT WE GET LESS DUTY ON OUR 
FUEL BECAUSE IT'S FROM RENEWABLE 
SOURCE THAN CONVENTIONAL DIESEL 
PEOPLE SHOULD BE PLEASED TO BE PART 
OF THIS THEY CAN DO THEIR BIT IN 
THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE 
AND TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES BY 
RECYCLING WASTE FROM THEIR EVERY 
DAY LIVES 
SO THE DIESEL THAT'S GOT 
YOUR BIO FUEL IN IT WILL THAT 
RETAIL AT THE SAME PRICE AS DIESEL 
DOES AT THE MOMENT 
THAT'S CORRECT 
IT'S AVAILABLE IN FORECOURTS ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY IT'S ON THE GO FOR 
THREE YEARS NO PROBLEMS WITH 
ENGINES NO MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED 
FOR ENGINES IT'S EFFECTIVELY A WAY 
OF HELPING TO SUPPLEMENT THE 
LIMITED SUPPLIES OF FOSSIL FUEL THE 
WORLD HAS AT THE MOMENT 
WITH NEW 
LEGISLATION FORCING OLD COMPANIES 
TO ADD RENEWABLES TO THEIR FUELS 
DEMAND FOR THE BIODIESEL MADE HERE 
IS SOARING ARGENT RECKONS IT COULD 
SELL FOUR TIMES AS MUCH AS IT DOES 
AT THE MOMENT AND IS WORKING ON 
PLANS FOR A SECOND REFINERY WE'RE 
JOINED BY ANDY TAIT HEAD OF 
BIODIVERSITY AT GREENPEACE AND 
CLARE RENNESER FROM THE RENEWABLE 
ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATION IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE IN YOUR 
REPORTS THERE ARE SOME BIOFUELS 
SUCH AS USING RECYCLED VEGTABLE OIL 
THAT CAN BE A GOOD THING IF YOU 
LOOK AT THE GOVERNMENT POLICY AND 
WHAT IT'S DOING THERE'S NO WAY TO 
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN GOOD BIOFUELS 
AND BAD ONES MOST OF THE FUELS 
COMING INTO THE U. K. USED FOR BIO 
FUEL NOW ARE BASED ON CROPS LIKE 
SOYA AND PALM OIL LINKED TO RAIN 
FOREST DESTRUCTION LINKED TO 
INCREASE GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS 
CLARE IS THAT YOUR VIEW IT'S TOO 
SIMPLE TO SAY YOU'RE FOR IT AND 
AGAINST AND THERE'S GOOD AND BAD 
THERE ARE DEFINITELY GOOD AND BAD 
BIOFUELS WITH A WE'VE BEEN LOOKING 
FOR WITH THE THE GOVERNMENT AND THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT AND 
ACADEMICS WE'VE BEEN LOOKING TO 
PUT IN STANDARDS THAT THE U. K. BIO 
FUEL INDUSTRIES ARE COMMITTED TO 
SUSTAINABILITY STANDARD AND 
STANDARDS FOR DELIVERING CARBON 
SAVINGS TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF OUR CARBON 
EMISSIONS COME FROM THE TRANSPORT 
SECRETARY TO DOING NOTHING IS NOT 
AN OPTION 
REALLY THE CRITICAL THING THERE IS 
THAT IT'S WORKING TOWARDS STANDARDS 
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS GOVERNMENT 
POLICY THERE ARE NO SUSTAINABILITY 
STANDARDS IN PLACE FOR AT LEAST 
THREE YEARS THAT MEANS FOR THE 
NEXT THREE YEARS COMPANIES ARE FREE 
TO BRING IN PRODUCTS BASED ON PALM 
OIL OR SOYA THAT ACTUALLY COULD BE 
WORSE FOR CLIMATE THAN USING FOSSIL 
FUELS THAT'S CLEARLY A MAD POLICY 
ANY POLICY THAT ALLOWS SITUATION 
IT WOULD BE A MAD POLICY IF IT WAS 
TRUE BUT THERE ARE STANDARDS 
GREENPEACE TESTED LAST WEEK 
PRODUCTS SOLD AT TESCO IT WAS 
BASED ON PALM OIL AND SOYA BOTH 
LINKED TO RAIN FOREST DESTRUCTION 
CLARE WHY DO YOU THINK THAT'S NOT 
TRUE 
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE STANDARDS TRUE THE ONLY THING THAT ISN'T IN PLACE 
IS WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A GO TO JAIL 
CARD WHICH WILL COME TO FORCE TODAY 
THAT GO TO JAIL CARD WILL COME INTO 
FORCE IN TWO YEARS' TIME BECAUSE 
THESE ARE COMPLICATED FUEL CHAINS 
AND PEOPLE AT THE OTHER END OF THE 
CHAINS WHO OFTEN CAN'T READ NEED TO 
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
ANDY IS 
GETTING HOT UNDER THE COLLAR ABOUT 
THIS BUT I WANT TO MOVE YOU ON FOR 
THE MOMENT ONE OF THE BIG DEBATES 
ON THIS IS WHAT THIS WILL DO FOR 
FOOD PRICES IF WE USE THIS FOR 
CROPS POORER PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD 
FOOD 
IT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES FOOD ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE THE FACT 
THAT SOME OF THESE CROPS ARE WORSE 
FOR THE CLIMATE THAN STAYING WITH 
FOSSIL FUELS ON THE OTHER HAND WE 
HAVE THE FACT THAT THESE ARE CROPS 
THAT WERE BEING USED FOR FOOD 
THEY'RE NOW BEING DIVERTED INTO 
FUEL IN THE SHORT TERM THAT'S 
PUSHING UP FOOD PRICES IN THE 
LONGER TERM IT'S LEADING TO 
EXPANSION OF FOOD CROPS INTO RAIN 
FORESTS FORESTS JUST AT THE MOMENT IT HAS TO BE 
NOTED THAT ONE PER CENT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND 
IS USED FOR BIOFUELS AT THE MOMENT 
THAT'S PREDICTED TO GO UP TO TWO PER CENT BY 
TWO THOUSAND THIRTY THAT MEANS NINETY NINE PER CENT IS FOR OTHER 
THINGS 
I HAVE TO STOP YOU SORRY THINGS YOU CAN CARRY ON OUTSIDE THE 
STUDIO THANK YOU 
THE CONSUMER CREDIT ACT SETS OUT 
WHAT BUSINESSES OFFERING CREDIT CAN 
AND CAN'T DO THE ACT IS IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE IT GIVES PROTECTION TOOUS 
CONSUMERS IT SETS OUT OUR RIGHTS 
WHEN WE BORROW THINGS RECENTLY THE 
ACT HAS BEEN OVERHAULED AND SOME OF 
THEM HAVE COME INTO FACT BECCY 
BODEN WILKES FROM NATIONAL DEBTLINE 
JOINS US NOW THE OFFICE OF FAIR 
TRADING OFT IS THE WATCHDOG THE 
POLICE WHO WATCH OUT AND THEY'VE 
BEEN GIVEN MORE TEETH TALK US 
THROUGH THEIR NEW POWERS 
HI YES 
THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN MORE POWERS SO 
THEY CAN AS THEY COULD BEFORE 
THEY COULD WITHDRAW SOMEBODY'S 
LICENCE IF THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY 
WERE IF THERE WERE BREACHES IN THE 
ACT AND THEY WEREN'T DOING WHAT 
THEY SHOULD BE DOING THEY CAN ALSO 
NOW PUT WHAT ARE CALLED SPECIFIC 
REQUIREMENTS IF THOSE SPECIFIC 
REQUIREMENTS HAVEN'T BEEN MET BY A 
LENDER THEY CAN FACE FINES OF UP TO 
FIFTY THOUSAND 
WE'VE ALSO RAISED THE FIFTY THOUSAND AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN BE 
INVOLVED BECAUSE IT ONLY USED COVER 
LOANS AND AGREEMENTS WHICH WERE 
BELOW TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WHICH IF YOU'RE 
BUYING A CAR OR SOMETHING ISN'T 
MUCH GOOD 
THAT'S RIGHT THEY'VE 
UPPED THE LIMIT FOR PERSONAL 
BORROWING SO THERE IS NO FINANCIAL 
LIMIT YOU CAN HAVE PROTECTION 
UNDER THE CONSUMER CREDIT ACT BUT 
FOR BUSINESSES IT HAS COST AT 
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND BUSINESSES ARE DEFINED 
A PARTNERSHIP WITH OF NO MORE THAN 
THREE PEOPLE 
THERE'S ALSO A CLAUSE 
SAYING IT WILL BE EASIER TO 
CHALLENGE CONTRACTS HOW WILL THAT 
WORK 
ONE OF THE CHANGES THAT IS WORK COMING IN IN OCTOBER RELATE TO THE 
COMPOUND INTEREST CHARGES AND THAT 
IT CAN'T ACTUALLY BE ADDED ON FOR 
DEFAULT CHARGES THOUGH ONLY 
PRINCIPAL SUMS OF THE LOAN OR 
AGREEMENT AND CONTRACTUAL INTEREST 
SO THE CHANGES THAT MEANS THERE 
WILL BE MORE INFORMATION THAT IT 
SHOULD BE EASIER FOR YOU TO KNOW 
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN CHARGED FOR AND 
STATUTORY PROCESSES OF WHEN DEFAULT 
NOTICE ARE GIVEN ALL THOSE CHANGES 
COME IN IN OCTOBER 
WE'RE ALSO 
SHOWING CLEARER INFORMATION 
SIMPLER CHARGES THESE CHANGES ARE 
DUE IN OCTOBER AS YOU'VE SAID BUT 
THERE ARE MORE CHANGES IN THE 
PIPELINE WHAT ELSE CAN WE EXPECT 
TO SEE 
THE MORE CHANGES THAT WILL 
COME IN AS I SAY THERE WILL BE 
MORE INFORMATION FOR THE CONSUMERS 
MORE RIGHTS AS WELL AND MORE TEETH 
FOR THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING SO 
DEFINITELY MORE CHANGES TO 
COME.BRIEFLY 
THERE'S TALK ABOUT COMEBRIEFLY UNFAIR RELATIONSHIPS WHAT DO THEY 
MEAN 
THE UNFAIR RELATIONSHIP TEST MEAN HAS CHANGED WHAT USED TO BE CALLED 
THE EXTORTIONATE CREDIT THIS MEANS 
IF SOMEBODY DOES THINK THERE HAS 
BEEN THEY'VE EITHER BEEN PUT ON AN 
EXTORTIONATE CREDIT AGREEMENT OR 
MISSOLD A LOAN YOU CAN GET ADVICE 
ON THE NATIONAL DEBTLINE OR CCS 
AND SEE IF YOU CAN APPLY TO THE 
COURT TO GET THE AGREEMENT REDONE 
FOR YOU THAT COULD MEAN THAT MONEY 
COULD BE GIVEN BACK TO THE DEBTOR 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE'RE BACK TOMORROW AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ON 
FRIDAY DON'T FORGET ESPECIALLY 
WITH ALL THIS TALK ABOUT HOUSE 
PRICES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
MORTGAGES SO GET YOUR QUESTIONS IN 
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
