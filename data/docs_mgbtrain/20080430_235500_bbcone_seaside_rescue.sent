THE MARITIME RESCUE SERVICES IN THE U. K. ARE ON CALL TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY 
THEY COVER OUR ENTIRE COASTLINE AND OPERATE ON LAND AT SEA AND IN THE AIR 
IN LEE ON SOLENT RESCUE HELICOPTER WHISKY BRAVO HAS BEEN SCRAMBLED 
AN EIGHTY ONE YEAR OLD WOMAN HAS FALLEN IN WOODLAND ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT 
FOR CAPTAIN MARK JACKSON AND HIS CREW THIS JOB IS GOING TO BE FAR FROM STRAIGHTFORWARD 
CREWMAN DAVE PEEL PREPARES TO BE WINCHED OUT OF THE AIRCRAFT 
I THINK IT'S THAT BAY THAT'S PRIORY BAY THERE 
IT'S JUST IN THE GREEN JUST HERE 
COASTGUARD WHISKY BRAVO IS ON SCENE 
ARE YOU CLEAR ROGER 
CAN YOU ACTUALLY SEE THE CASUALTY NEGATIVE NOT AT THE MOMENT 
IN WOODLAND THIS DENSE LOCATING THE CASUALTY IS GOING TO BE TOUGH 
ALSO ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT YARMOUTH IS HOME TO AN RNLI LIFEBOAT 
WHICH LOOKS AFTER ONE OF THE BUSIEST STRETCHES OF WATER IN THE U. K. THE SOLENT 
HOWARD LESTER HAS BEEN STATION COXSWAIN FOR EIGHT YEARS 
THE BEST PARTS OF THE JOB I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY ARE MAKING SURE THAT YOU GET SOMEBODY IN SAFE AND SOUND 
THAT HAS BEEN IN DISTRESS AT SEA IT'S OBVIOUSLY NICE TO GO OUT AND HELP SOMEBODY 
AND ALSO THE COMMUNITY SPIRIT WE HAVE HERE IT'S GREAT TO BE WORKING WITH THE CREW 
THEY'RE ALL MY FRIENDS I'VE BEEN HERE ALL MY LIFE 
SO IT'S A GREAT THING TO DO AS A TEAM 
CONFIRM THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ON BOARD OVER 
COASTGUARDS RECEIVE A MAYDAY CALL 
AN ANGLING BOAT HAS LOST POWER AND IS STRANDED 
WE HAVE EIGHT PERSONS ON BOARD FOUR ADULTS AND FOUR CHILDREN OVER 
THE LIFEBOAT VOLUNTEERS HAVE BEEN PAGED 
THERE ARE EIGHT PERSONS ON BOARD FOUR ADULTS FOUR CHILDREN 
JUST A MILE OR SO DOWN THE COAST HERE 
TO A BROKEN DOWN FISHING BOAT I RECKON WE'LL PROBABLY GO STRAIGHT ALONGSIDE I WOULD THINK 
FOUR OF THE PASSENGERS ARE CHILDREN 
THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH LIFEJACKETS TO GO AROUND 
SOUTHERN COASTGUARD 
THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN IS PARAMOUNT 
SO HOWARD'S FIRST PRIORITY WILL BE TO GET THEM OFF 
ABOVE THE ISLE OF WIGHT THE CREW OF WHISKY BRAVO ARE TRYING TO FIND 
THE EIGHTY ONE YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO FELL IN WOODLAND 
THE WOMAN'S INJURIES ARE UNKNOWN SO THEY NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY 
JUST LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE WAVING IN BETWEEN THE TREES 
IT'S CREWMAN JOHN SPENCER'S JOB TO DIRECT THE PILOT 
GOT A FOOTPATH JUST DOWN BELOW US 
RIGHT STEADY 
I CAN SEE SOMEONE WAVING DIRECTLY BELOW 
IT'S ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK AT ABOUT TWENTY UNITS 
SHE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TREES 
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING YOU JUST GIVE ME 
THESE ARE NOT IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR WINCHING 
LIGHT WINDS MEAN THEY NEED MAXIMUM POWER SIMPLY TO HOVER 
BUT THAT MEANS THEY'LL HAVE NO MORE POWER IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG 
O. K. CAN YOU MARK THIS POSITION YEAH I'VE GOT IT 
BECAUSE I'M GONNA HAVE TO DUMP FUEL IF WE'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING HERE 
THE SAFEST OPTION IS TO HOVER USING LESS POWER 
TO DO THAT THEY MUST DUMP FUEL AND REDUCE WEIGHT 
O. K. DAVE YOU CAN DO IT NOW O. K. OPEN NOW 
WINCHING THROUGH TREES IS RISKY FOR DAVE PEEL AND THE CASUALTY 
THEY LOOK FOR ANOTHER WAY DOWN 
I RECKON THE QUICKEST ACCESS WOULD BE FROM THE BEACH WITH THE STRETCHER 
AND YOU CAN WALK UP THROUGH THE WOODS AND THEN YOU'RE WITH THEM 
SOUNDS GOOD 
YARMOUTH LIFEBOAT HAS BEEN CALLED TO AN ANGLING BOAT THAT'S LOST POWER AND HAS EIGHT PEOPLE ON BOARD 
WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A FUN MORNING'S FISHING FOR THESE CHILDREN HAS TURNED INTO AN ENDURANCE TEST 
BUT A RIDE ON THE LIFEBOAT HAS A CERTAIN ENDURING APPEAL 
A COUPLE OF LINES ON ADAM THEN WE CAN PULL HIM FORWARD ON HIS ANKLES FOR THE CREW IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL 
THERE ARE ROPES TO TIE AND AN ANCHOR TO RAISE BEFORE FREEDOM TWO CAN HITCH A LIFT BACK TO DRY LAND 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM INTO YARMOUTH HARBOUR AND THEN PUT HIM ON THE PONTOON ON THE QUAY WHARF 
HOPEFULLY HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SORT HIMSELF OUT 
I WISH I WAS A FISHERMAN 
TUMBLING ON THE SEAS 
FISHERMAN ALAN CREWS GOT A BIGGER CATCH THAN HE BARGAINED FOR 
DROP THE ANCHOR DOWN DONE ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES' FISHING 
THE LAST TIME WE WENT TO START THE ENGINES AND THE BATTERIES WERE FLAT 
WE WERE LIKE WHAT DO WE DO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING YOU CAN'T PUSH START TO GET GOING AGAIN 
VERY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF BOATS JUST GAVE ME A BIT OF A ROLLOCKING 
A COUPLE OF US DIDN'T HAVE LIFEJACKETS ON WHICH WE ALL SHOULD HAVE HAD 
BUT I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME TRAINING COURSES NOW 
GOING OUT IN A BOAT LIKE THIS SEEMS GOOD BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT 
IT IS QUITE SCARY OUT THERE WHEN YOU BREAK DOWN 
WE'VE GOT TWO ON HERE SO HOPEFULLY NOW WE'RE UP AND RUNNING 
WE SHOULD CHECK OUT THE BATTERIES COS WE'VE GOT AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM 
BUT THANKS TO THE COASTGUARD THANKS TO THE OTHER LIFEBOAT 
AND THANKS TO THE HARBOURMASTER WE'RE ALL SAFE AND WE'RE ALL O. K. 
ON BOARD WHISKY BRAVO THE CREW ARE PREPARING TO PUT DAVE PEEL ONTO THE BEACH 
O. K. MARK THE THEORY I'M GONNA PUT DOWN IS HE'S ON THE NOSE AT THIRTY UNITS 
BEFORE WE GO IS HE GONNA GET UP THIS IT'S VERY STEEP ON THE NOSE YEAH IT IS VERY STEEP 
IT'S ALMOST A CLIFF I DON'T THINK YOU'LL GET UP THAT DAVE NO I DON'T 
THAT'S VERY STEEP DO YOU WANT TO GO OVER THE TOP WE'LL WINCH YOU THROUGH THE TREES 
I THINK WE MAY HAVE TO DO THAT PROVIDING DAVE'S HAPPY WITH THAT 
IF YOU GET ME DOWN THERE THEN I CAN ASSESS IT 
O. K. IN THE EVENT OF AN ENGINE FAILURE GUYS WE'RE GOING INTO THE TREES 
THIS MAY SOUND ALARMING BUT DURING AN OPERATION OF THIS NATURE THE CREW MUST PLAN FOR EVERY EVENTUALITY 
ON THE NOSE AT ABOUT THREE UNITS NOW 
THERE'S A BIG HOLE IN THE TREE SO I CAN GET THROUGH JUST HERE 
CLEAR WINCH CLEAR WINCH ROGER BRING HIM TO THE DOOR 
WINCH NOW OUT THE DOOR DIRECTLY ABOVE THE AREA 
TELL ME WHEN HE'S ENTERING THE TREES YEAH WILL DO 
TO THE RIGHT ONE 
STEADY STEADY STEADY 
STEADY RIGHT ONE ONLY STEADY ENTERING THE TREES 
RIGHT ONE 
RIGHT ONE 
RIGHT ONE STEADY 
STEADY 
LEFT ONE 
ON THE GROUND LEFT ONE 
STEADY 
STEADY 
STEADY STAND BY 
JUST DISCONNECT IT 
RIGHT ONE 
WELL DONE JOHN 
OBVIOUSLY WHEN HE'S IN THERE I CAN'T AFFORD TO MOVE AT ALL 
ON THE GROUND DAVE'S FIRST JOB IS TO OFFER SOME COMFORT AND FIND OUT THE EXTENT OF THE LADY'S INJURIES 
HAVE YOU HAD ANY HEART PROBLEMS BEFORE NOT ON MY CHEST NO 
NOT ON YOUR CHEST MY SPINE Y. E. S. 
I'VE TWO FRACTURED VERTEBRAE ON MY SPINE 
ON YOUR SPINE 
THIS PAIN ACROSS THE CHEST AT THE MOMENT 
CAN YOU FEEL IT IN YOUR ARMS AS WELL 
NO NOT REALLY 
IT'S MORE JUST FROM THERE 
ACROSS TO THERE O. K. 
AND IT'S JUST MAKING YOU VERY TIRED 
ALL RIGHT DON'T WORRY SWEETHEART WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU SORTED MY LOVE WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
BETTY BETTY YEAH I'M DAVID WE'RE GOING TO SORT THINGS OUT ALL RIGHT 
FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS CORNWALL HAS BEEN A MECCA FOR SURFERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
THE BEACH AT PERRANPORTH ATTRACTS SURFERS OF ALL ABILITIES 
A FEMALE TEENAGER WITH A HIP INJURY 
IT'S GONE RIGHT INTO ALMOST THE BOTTOM OF HER ABDOMEN TOP OF THE PELVIS 
RNLI BEACH LIFEGUARDS HAVE COME TO THE AID OF SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CLARE GRAYSON 
WHO HAS BEEN HIT BY A FRIEND'S SURFBOARD 
DOES IT FEEL LIKE IT'S STARTING TO GET TIGHTER AND SWOLLEN UP AT ALL YEAH 
SUSTAINED AN INJURY AND IT'S GONNA START CAUSING INTERNAL BLEEDING OR SOMETHING 
WORST CASE SCENARIO BUT THEN WE NEED TO GET THAT CHECKED OUT 
I TRIED TO WALK FROM THE SEA AND I COULDN'T MOVE MY LEG 
YOU WERE WALKING A LITTLE BIT AFTER IT HAPPENED SO O. K. 
I THINK WE NEED TO GET YOU IN THE BACK OF OUR VEHICLE 
AND TAKE YOU UP TO THE SURF CLUB 
IF IT GETS TOO PAINFUL YOU'VE GOT TO SAY WE'LL PUT YOU BACK DOWN AGAIN 
CLARE CAN'T WALK SO ROBIN AND BEN DECIDE TO TAKE HER TO THE TREATMENT ROOM 
PUT YOUR ARM ROUND MY SHOULDERS O. K. THANK YOU 
I'LL PROBABLY BREAK YOUR BACK NOW 
THEN WE NEED TO CHECK THIS SIDE TO MAKE SURE THAT 
IF IT'S SWOLLEN IF THERE'S BRUISING WE JUST NEED TO BE SURE OF THAT 
SHE MANAGED TO STUMBLE OUT OF THE WATER AND JUST THEN LAY ON HER BOARD 
TOP OF THE PELVIS ALMOST LOWER ABDOMEN AS WELL 
SHE CAN'T REALLY MOVE THAT WELL 
THE FRIEND WHOSE BOARD INFLICTED THE DAMAGE IS ANXIOUS TO MAKE AMENDS 
ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT THE CREW HAVE MANAGED TO THREAD DAVE PEEL 
DOWN THROUGH THE TREES TO EIGHTY ONE YEAR OLD BETTY BELL 
WE'LL SORT THINGS OUT 
BUT NOW THEY'VE GOT TO GET THEM OUT 
IT'S BRINGING 'EM BACK THAT'S THE ISSUE 
TO BE HONEST WE CAN'T DO THAT FROM THERE 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET THAT STRETCHER 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SLIDE IT DOWN THE HILL EVEN IF IT MEANS ROPING IT HE'S GOT TWO COASTGUARDS WITH HIM 
SHE LITERALLY JUST SLIPPED DOWN THERE AND FELL AND BANGED HERSELF ON THE GROUND 
YEAH WAS IT LITERALLY A FALL 
IT WASN'T THROUGH A FAINT OR ANYTHING NO IT WAS LITERALLY JUST SLIPPING 
A FALL AND THEN SHE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE SHE COULDN'T GET UP 
ALL RIGHT BETTY THIS IS JUST TO MAKE YOU FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE O. K. 
THE OXYGEN WILL HELP 
STAY MOBILE THIS IS RESCUE WHISKY BRAVO 
COULD YOU TELL ME THE BEST WAY OF GETTING THE CASUALTY OUT OF THOSE WOODS 
JOHN CAN YOU GET A STRETCHER DOWN TO ME 
I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE TO PULL HER UP BETWEEN THE TREES 
IT'S A VERY MUDDY PATH THERE'S ABOUT HALF A MILE TO TRY AND MANOEUVRE HER 
I CAN'T PUT HER INTO A HYPOTHERMIC LIFT BECAUSE SHE'S GOT VERTEBRAE PROBLEMS 
THE MAIN PROBLEM IS CHEST PAINS AFTER A FALL 
I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO PUT HER INTO A STRETCHER AND WE'LL HAVE TO WINCH BACK UP TO THE AIRCRAFT 
ROGER DO YOU KNOW WHAT CONCERNS ME WITH THIS 
WHAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOWERED HIM DOWN WE HAD THE TREES GOING ALL OVER THE PLACE YEP 
WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS GET THEM SNAGGED IN A TREE WITH THE STRETCHER 
THIS IS RESCUE WHISKY BRAVO WE'RE JUST GETTING THE STRETCHER READY 
SEE IF SHE CAN STAND 
BEING WINCHED TWO HUNDRED FEET THROUGH TREES WOULD BE DAUNTING FOR ANYONE BUT PARTICULARLY FOR BETTY 
SHE'S TERRIFIED OF IT YEAH I KNOW 
KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED 
YOU'VE GOT A HANDSOME MAN TO HOLD YOU 
IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA WHEN WE SET OFF THIS MORNING TO GO FOR A NICE WALK IN SAINT HELENS 
WE'VE NOT DONE THIS BIT BEFORE 
STEADY STEADY 
IT'S DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO GET AN EMPTY STRETCHER THROUGH THE TREES WITH THIS AMOUNT OF TURBULENCE 
BRINGING IT BACK WITH BETTY AND DAVE WILL PRESENT A WHOLE NEW SET OF PROBLEMS 
DISCONNECT HIM 
WINCHING YOU'RE CLEAR 
WHISKY BRAVO COPIED 
WE'VE NOW WINCHED OUR STRETCHER DOWN TO THE CASUALTY 
IN PERRANPORTH CLARE'S INJURIES ARE BEING ASSESSED BY THE LIFEGUARDS 
SHE RAMMED IT STRAIGHT INTO HER HIP DOES IT HURT HERE 
YEP JUST A BIT OF PRESSURE THERE 
DOES IT HURT THERE NO HERE THAT'S QUITE PAINFUL 
SHE'S HURT HER HIP I DON'T THINK SHE'S DISLOCATED IT OR BROKEN IT BUT SHE'S IN AGONY 
SHE COULDN'T MOVE IT WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT INTERNAL BLEEDING 
AS IT'S HERE IT'S IMPACTED AGAINST THAT BONE 
AND IT MIGHT WELL BE A LIGHT FRACTURE OR LIGHT CHIP ON THAT PELVIS 
THEY CALL FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND THE EMERGENCY SERVICES DECIDE TO SEND AN AIR AMBULANCE 
B. A R. S. C. H. 
IF YOU JUST HEAD DOWN WE'VE GOT TO KEEP A BIG AREA FREE AND JUST KEEP EVERYONE BACK 
JUST ROUND THE CORNER TELL EVERYONE TO MOVE OUT THE WAY 
CAN YOU SEE WHERE ANDY IS 
AS CLARE HEADS FOR HOSPITAL HER SURFING BUDDY HANNA FEELS A PANG OF GUILT 
WE WERE GONNA GO OUT AND THE CURRENT WAS REALLY STRONG 
CLARE WAS BEHIND ME AND THE BOARD WENT STRAIGHT INTO HER HIP 
I COULDN'T CONTROL IT COS THE WAVE WAS TOO HEAVY 
IT WAS KIND OF MY FAULT IF I'D HAD MORE CONTROL OVER THE BOARD IT MIGHT NOT HAVE HIT HER 
TWO SECONDS 
DOWN YOU GO VERY SLOWLY 
HOW ARE YOU BETTY DAVE PEEL IS GETTING BETTY ON TO THE STRETCHER 
MOVE HER OVER TO THE LEFT ON MY CALL NICE AND SLOWLY 
SHE'S HAD A BAD FALL AND WITH A HISTORY OF SPINAL PROBLEMS MOVING HER REQUIRES GREAT CARE 
IF YOU CAN LEAN BACK AND LIE DOWN 
LOVELY 
OH SWEETHEART 
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO DAVE IS MAINTAIN ON TOP POSITION 
AND WINCH YOU ALL THE WAY TO THE AIRCRAFT 
THIS IS MOBILE THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE JOHN 
ARE YOU READY FOR US TO RUN IN 
MOBILE READY TO RUN IN ROGER RUNNING IN 
ARE WE HAPPY WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING DAVE 
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY 
RIGHT I'M HAPPY 
ON THE WAY OUT IF WE HAVE AN ENGINE FAILURE BEFORE SHE REACHES THE TOP 
OR AT ANY STAGE I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE WATER 
YOU'LL HAVE TO CUT THE CABLE I'M AFRAID 
IT'LL BE OVER SEA HOPEFULLY O. K. STEADY 
IT'S SOMEWHERE NEAR HERE

CALLED A HIGH LINE TO STOP THE STRETCHER SPINNING 
TO SAVE TIME THE HIGH LINE IS JETTISONED 
FOR BETTY A WALK IN THE WOODS ENDS WITH A JOURNEY SHE'LL NEVER FORGET 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AFTER DAVE HANDS BETTY OVER TO THE MEDICAL TEAM ON THE GROUND 
HE AND THE PILOT HAVE TIME TO REFLECT ON A JOB WELL DONE 
SHE'S A LOVELY LADY THEY NEARLY ALWAYS ARE IN THOSE SITUATIONS 
THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TO CAUSE ANY TROUBLE 
THERE'S NO CHOICE TO THE SITUATION THEY'RE IN SHE'S A LOVELY LADY 
AS LONG AS I COULD KEEP HER SMILING I WAS HAPPY MYSELF 
A REAL HAZARDOUS JOB FOR US THAT 
WE'D ONLY ATTEMPT THAT JOB IF WE WERE SURE THE CASUALTY WAS IN A BAD WAY 
THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVED WAS THE CASE 
BETTY IS TAKEN TO HOSPITAL 
WHISKY BRAVO IS READY FOR HER NEXT JOB 
FALMOUTH IN CORNWALL HAS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST NATURAL HARBOURS 
IT ATTRACTS THOUSANDS OF TOURISTS EVERY YEAR 
KEEPING THEM SAFE ON FALMOUTH'S COASTLINE ARE TWO LIFEBOATS 
BEACH LIFEGUARDS AND A COASTGUARD RESCUE TEAM 
WE'RE NOW LEAVING C. R. E. THREE P. O. B 
THEY'VE HAD REPORTS OF A MAN STUCK AT THE BOTTOM OF A CLIFF 
AND THE TIDE IS RISING 
JUST OVER THERE TO MY RIGHT HAND SIDE A NICE BIT OF YELLOW ON THE CLIFF 
LOOKS LIKE THE CASUALTY HAS MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THAT SLIPPED BEFORE THAT POINT AND FALLEN 
AS YOU CAN SEE IF WE HAD TO DO A CLIFF RESCUE HERE 
WE'D HAVE HAD TO WORK OUR WAY THROUGH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YARDS OF BRACKEN TO GET OVER THE CLIFF 
CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING THIS IS MOBILE OVER 
IF THE MAN HAS FALLEN HE COULD BE SERIOUSLY INJURED 
ONE PERSON STUCK ON THE CLIFF 
COASTGUARDS HAVE REQUESTED THE LAUNCH OF THE FALMOUTH LIFEBOAT 
HAVE YOU GOT A DISTANCE FROM WHERE YOU ARE ROGER APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE 
THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THE MAN IS 
WE'LL WORK RIGHT AND LEFT FROM YOUR POSITION OVER ROGER 
SO THE LIFEBOAT CREW SCAN THE SHORELINE 
IT'S LIKE LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK 
WE'LL START AT NEWPORT AND WORK UP 
AT PERRANPORTH FINDING THE PARENTS OF LOST CHILDREN 
CAN ALSO BE LIKE LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK 
MY NAME'S CHRIS I'M A LIFEGUARD YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PERSON

OH MY GOD 
SHE'S BEEN MISSING FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES I THOUGHT I'D LOST HER 
WE'VE FOUND THE MOTHER OVER THANK YOU SO MUCH I WAS JUST PUTTING AWAY THE BEACH TENT 
I HAD MY BACK TO HER AND TURNED AROUND AND SHE'D JUST DISAPPEARED 
I THINK SHE WAS A BIT OVERCOME WITH EMOTION 
YEAH GOT THEM BACK TOGETHER 
YOU DO GET MOTHERS AND FATHERS THAT ARE VERY EMOTIONAL WHEN THEIR KIDS GO MISSING 
YOU GET USED TO THAT THEY FOUND HER THANK YOU SO MUCH 
WE'VE SOME PAPERWORK TO FILL IN IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT 
AFTER A SEARCH OF THE FALMOUTH COASTLINE LIFEBOAT HELM DAVE NICHOL HAS SPOTTED THE STRANDED MAN 
FAR SIDE SEE HIM 
I'LL DROP YOU ON THE END HERE IT'S THE BEST WAY TO PICK YOU UP TOO 
CREWMAN MARK THOMAS JUMPS ONTO THE ROCKS 
HOW ARE YOU DOING 
ARE YOU A BIT CUT OFF 
YEAH I JUMPED ONE BECAUSE IT WASN'T TOO FAR 
I JUMPED IN ONE TO GO ACROSS BUT I'M NOT A GOOD SWIMMER AND THAT'S WHERE IT'S ENDED 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
POP THAT OVER YOUR HEAD O. K. 
O. K. THAT'S IT WELL DONE 
TAKE YOURSELF BACK DOWN TO THE SEAT 
WHERE HAVE YOU COME FROM I'VE COME FROM FALMOUTH 
O. K. HAVE YOU GOT A CAR 
NO I'LL WALK BACK 
WE'VE RECOVERED THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE ROCKS 
WE'LL LAND HIM BACK AT THE BOAT HOUSE OVER 
THEO IS A LUCKY MAN 
I WENT OUT FOR A WALK FROM FALMOUTH 
AND TOOK THE CLIFF PATH THE LOWER CLIFF PATH 
AND IT GOT A BIT ROCKIER AND I HAD TO JUMP ACROSS ONE OR TWO BREAKS IN THE CLIFF 
IT WAS A BIG BREAK IN THE CLIFF AND I'M NOT THAT GOOD A CLIMBER OR SWIMMER 
SO I GOT STUCK OUT THERE MARK DAVE AND CARL VERY KINDLY CAME AND PICKED ME UP 
DUSK IS FALLING 
THE EMERGENCY SERVICES' PROMPT ACTION SAVED THEO FROM A VERY LONG AND COLD NIGHT ON THE ROCKS 
WHEN LIFEGUARDS FOUND CLARE GRAYSON SHE WAS UNABLE TO WALK HAVING BEEN HIT BY A FRIEND'S SURFBOARD 
I WAS TRYING TO STABILISE MYSELF BECAUSE IT WAS SO PAINFUL 
IT WAS THE MOST PAIN I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE 
AFTER BEING AIRLIFTED TO HOSPITAL CLARE WAS LUCKY TO HAVE SUFFERED NO MORE THAN BAD BRUISING 
BUT SHE'S GRATEFUL TO THE PEOPLE THAT CAME TO HER AID 
THEY'RE VERY REASSURING 
DURING THE TIME WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON 
VERY GOOD 
BETTY PRESENTED THE CREW OF WHISKY BRAVO WITH AN EVEN MORE SERIOUS CHALLENGE 
WHEN SHE FELL IN WOODLAND ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT 
CREWMAN DAVE PEEL MADE A DANGEROUS TWO HUNDRED F. T. WINCH TO COME TO HER RESCUE 
I KNEW THAT IF HE COULDN'T GET ME I COULDN'T GET OUT ON MY OWN 
IT WAS THE ONLY THING WHICH COULD HAVE GOT ME OUT WAS A HELICOPTER 
WE'LL SORT THINGS OUT ALL RIGHT 
I MEAN AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED DAVE WAS THERE 
WHEN I OPENED MY EYES HE WAS THERE AND HE WAS GREAT 
HE JUST SAID O. K. WE'LL SOON HAVE YOU OUT OF HERE 
THE TREES WERE GOING WAVING ABOUT LIKE MAD 
MOVING SOMEONE WITH A SPINAL INJURY IS COMPLICATED ENOUGH 
BUT LIFTING HER THROUGH TREES MADE THIS AN EXCEPTIONAL PIECE OF WORK 
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING UP ON MY OWN 
SO I OPENED MY EYES AND THERE'S DAVE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE STRETCHER 
I DON'T KNOW HOW ON EARTH HE WAS HANGING ON THERE 
I SHUT MY EYES AGAIN AND I WAS GOING UP AND UP 
THE NEXT THING I KNEW THEY WERE GETTING ME IN THE HELICOPTER 
AFTER A STAY IN HOSPITAL BETTY IS WELL ON HER WAY TO RECOVERY 
SHE'S UP AND ABOUT WITH WALKING COMPANION NORMA 
THE CREW OF WHISKY BRAVO HAVE CERTAINLY GOT A NEW FAN 
I THINK THEY'RE JUST WONDERFUL 
THEY'RE REALLY GREAT 
THERE'S NO FUSS NOTHING 
IF EVER IT HAPPENED TO ME AGAIN I'D HAVE NO HESITATION AT ALL 
IN GOING UP INTO THE HELICOPTER BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST WONDERFUL 
REALLY GREAT 
NEXT TIME ON SEASIDE RESCUE A RIP CURRENT PUS THE LIVES OF DOZENS OF SWIMMERS IN DANGER 
DO YOU WANT TO JUMP ON THERE I'LL GIVE YOU A RUN IN 
AND A MAN FIGHTS FOR HIS LIFE AFTER JUMPING ONE HUNDRED F. T. INTO WATER 
HE HAS NOT COME UP HE COULD HAVE HIT THE ROCKS
