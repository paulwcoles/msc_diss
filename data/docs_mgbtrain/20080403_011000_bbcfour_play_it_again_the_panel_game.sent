PLAY IT AGAIN A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT PANEL GAMES AND THE PEOPLE WHO PLAYED THEM YOUR HOST HUGH DENNIS 
IF YOU HAPPENED TO BE WATCHING YOUR NINE INCH BAKELITE RECEIVER ON A SUNDAY EVENING IN JULY NINETEEN FIFTY ONE 
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN A YOUNG BOXING COMMENTATOR CALLED EAMONN ANDREWS 
INTRODUCE A LITTLE BIT OF T. V. HISTORY 
WELCOME TO WHAT'S MY LINE 
THE FIRST BROADCAST OF THE FIRST EDITION OF BRITISH T. V.'S FIRST PANEL GAME WHAT'S MY LINE 
THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THE RULES WILL FIND THEM VERY QUICKLY AS WE ASK OUR FIRST CHALLENGER TO SIGN IN 
THE FORMAT WAS SIMPLE 
FERDINAND ROSENTHAL HOW ARE YOU 
AN ORDINARY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WOULD MIME A CONFUSING CLUE 
BEFORE BEING GENTLY INTERROGATED BY A PANEL OF PERSONALITIES 
GOOD EVENING GOOD EVENING HELLO 
THE CHALLENGER COULD ONLY ANSWER YES AND NO 
IS YOUR JOB ARTISTIC IN ANY WAY NO 
THAT'S TWO GONE 
TEN NOS AND THE CHALLENGER WOULD RECEIVE AN ATTRACTIVE DIPLOMA AND A HANDSHAKE 
HERE JUST AS WELL I DIDN'T GO AT THE SAME TIME 
SIMPLE HARDLY ANYTHING TO IT BUT IT WAS A BROADCASTING SENSATION 
THE FIRST SERIES PLANNED TO LAST SIX WEEKS 
RAN FOR NEARLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
WHAT'S MY LINE CREATED A GOLDEN AGE OF THE T. V. PANEL GAME THAT WOULD LAST A DECADE 
A WHOLE RAFT OF OTHER SHOWS TRIED TO REPEAT ITS WINNING FORMULA 
SOME SUCCEEDED SOME FAILED 
NOBODY REMEMBERS WHAT WHEN WHERE WHY OR ASK YOUR DAD NOW 
BUT THE SAME BASIC NINETEEN FIFTIES RECIPE A HOST A PANEL AND SOME QUESTIONS 
IS STILL WITH US TODAY 
LET'S MEET TONIGHT'S PANEL WHO LIKE A PROPERLY MADE CAULIFLOWER MILKSHAKE 
ARE THICK INTERESTING AND UNUSUAL 
WHAT'S MY LINE WAS BRITAIN'S FIRST T. V. PANEL GAME 
BUT IT ISN'T THE START OF THE STORY 
IN FACT THE FIRST BRITISH PANEL GAME HIT 
WAS LAUNCHED TEN YEARS EARLIER IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE 
BUT NOT ON TELEVISION BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ANY 
THAT'S BECAUSE THE NATION'S FIVE THOUSAND T. V. SCREENS HAD GONE BLANK WITHOUT WARNING 
ON THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER NINETEEN THIRTY NINE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CARTOON 
BRITAIN WAS TO GO TO WAR TWO DAYS LATER 
AND THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T WANT MICKEY MOUSE INTERFERING WITH THEIR RADAR SYSTEMS 
SO IT WAS LEFT TO THE WIRELESS TO KEEP THE NATION'S PECKER UP 
A VARIETY PRODUCER CALLED HOWARD THOMAS DECAMPED TO BRISTOL TO AVOID THE BLITZ 
THOUGHT HE'D DREAMT UP THE VERY THING 
THE ORIGINAL B. B. C. BRAINS TRUST FIRST WENT INTO A HUDDLE ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY NINETEEN FORTY ONE 
THE IDEA WAS TO ENCOURAGE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE SERVICES 
TO ASK QUESTIONS AND TO HEAR EXPERTS DEALING WITH THEIR QUESTIONS 
THEY WERE ACADEMIC QUESTIONS 
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS 
AND THESE OLD FUDDY DUDDIES WHO SEEMED TO BE CONNECTED WITH A SERIES OF COBWEBS 
YOU KNOW DRIPPING FROM THEM 
SAID WE HAD A QUESTION FROM THIS LADY IN TUNBRIDGE WELLS WHICH SAYS 
WHAT DOES THE BRAINS TRUST CONSIDER THE BASIS OF HAPPY MARRIAGE 
EACH WEEK THE RADIO BRAINS TRUST ATTRACTED ELEVEN MILLION LISTENERS 
AND THREE THOUSAND QUESTIONS 
IT WAS EVERYTHING THE B. B. C. THOUGHT ITS PROGRAMMES SHOULD BE 
ENTERTAINING INFORMATIVE EDUCATIONAL 
IT WAS SUCH A HIT THAT IT BECAME THE FIRST AND ONLY PANEL GAME TO BE TURNED INTO A FEATURE FILM 
TEN YEARS BEFORE THE PANEL GAME REACHED T. V. YOU COULD GO AND SEE ONE AT THE LOCAL PICTURE HOUSE 
THIS IS THE FIRST FILM EVER MADE WITHOUT SCRIPTS WITHOUT REHEARSALS 
AND IN CASE IT ISN'T OBVIOUS I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE BRAINS TRUST 
HAVEN'T ANY IDEA WHAT QUESTIONS I'M GOING TO PUT TO THEM 
AND I HAVEN'T ANY IDEA WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY 
THE DAY AFTER THE BRAINS TRUST DELIVERED ITS VERDICT 
WORKERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WOULD BE REPEATING THEIR DEBATES 
THE WOMAN SHOULD BE AS COMPLETELY AS POSSIBLE A WOMAN 
CONCERNED THAT IS TO SAY WITH HOUSEWIFELY THINGS 
LOOKING AFTER A HOUSE MAKING A BACKGROUND FOR A MAN 
AND CONTENT TO DO IT 
A WOMAN WHO CAN SO REGARD A MAN LAYS A PROPER FOUNDATION FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE 
I THINK WHAT WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO IS A CONFESSION AND A CONFESSION OF FAILURE 
THE SHOW RAN FOR FOUR YEARS ON THE HOME SERVICE 
BUT AFTER THE WAR THE BRAINS TRUST GAVE WAY TO OTHER SHOWS 
THAT FEATURED PANELS OF EXPERTS 
ONCE AGAIN THE BLUE NETWORK IN NEW YORK AND THE B. B. C. IN LONDON 
PRESENT TRANSATLANTIC QUIZ 
THIS UNREHEARSED SPONTANEOUS PROGRAMME IS CARRIED ACROSS THREE THOUSAND MILES OF OCEAN 
AND BROUGHT TO YOU BY SHORTWAVE TRANSCRIPTION 
ARE YOU THERE LONDON 
THEN THE MONEY RAN OUT FOR THE LINK TO AMERICA SO IT BECAME ROUND BRITAIN QUIZ 
THE RADIO PANELS OF THE FORTIES WERE ALMOST ENTIRELY MADE UP OF STOUT MEN WITH GOOD BRAINS 
WHO WERE KEEN TO STIMULATE THE MIND OF THE LISTENER 
THEY WEREN'T ABOUT FUN 
BUT THEN THE B. B. C. WAS OFFERED A NEW KIND OF RADIO QUIZ 
TWENTY QUESTIONS WAS AS FRIVOLOUS AS THE BRAINS TRUST WAS SERIOUS 
THE PANEL HAD TWENTY QUESTIONS TO GUESS AN OBJECT BE IT ANIMAL VEGETABLE OR MINERAL 
AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE EXPERTS ON ANYTHING THEY JUST HAD TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME 
YOU HAD SOME TERRIFIC PERSONALITIES YOU HAD ANONA WINN A LIGHT MUSICAL COMEDY STAR 
JOY ADAMSON JACK TRAIN WAS A BRILLIANT COMEDIAN HE'D BEEN ON THE ITMA PROGRAMME WITH TOMMY HANDLEY 
AND YOU HAD DEAR OLD GILBERT HARDING 
HE WAS A VERY CLEVER INTELLECTUAL WELL EDUCATED SOPHISTICATED MAN 
HE HAD BEEN A SCHOOLTEACHER 
BUT HE WAS EXTREMELY GOOD A BECAUSE HIS KNOWLEDGE WAS SO DEEP 
BUT B. BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS ON THE EDGE OF LOSING HIS TEMPER 
AND VERY HAPPY HE IS TO BE HERE WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL AS LARGE AS LIFE AND TWICE AS NASTY 
WHEEZY GRUMPY AND STERN HE WAS MUCH ADMIRED AT BROADCASTING HOUSE AS A QUESTION MASTER 
AND FOR PUTTING AWAY THREE LARGE GLASSES OF STRONG LIQUOR BEFORE A RECORDING AND NOT LETTING IT SHOW 
THOUGH IT DID HIS HEALTH NO GOOD 
NORMAN WE WILL GO IF YOU PLEASE TO THE QUICKIE 
THE QUICKIE IS GILBERT'S HOSPITAL NURSE 
GILBERT'S HOSPITAL NURSE 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT EVERY CHILD HAS PLAYED TWENTY QUESTIONS THE B. B. C. IMPORTED THE GAME FROM AMERICA 
WELCOME TO TWENTY QUESTIONS 
THE UNREHEARSED ANIMAL VEGETABLE AND MINERAL GAME THAT EVERYBODY IS PLAYING 
IN NINETEEN FORTY NINE NEW JERSEY NEWSMAN FRED VAN DEVENTER HAD LAUNCHED TWENTY QUESTIONS ON THE N. B. C. NETWORK 
ITS PANEL STARRED AN EXCITING NEW TALENT CALLED FRED VAN DEVENTER 
AS WELL AS FLORENCE RINARD OR TO USE HER MARRIED NAME FLORENCE VAN DEVENTER 
AND BOBBY MCGUIRE OTHERWISE KNOWN AS BOBBY VAN DEVENTER 
THE VAN DEVENTER FAMILY MADE TWENTY QUESTIONS AMERICA'S FIRST PANEL GAME SUCCESS 
THEY'D SPOTTED THAT YOU COULD PACKAGE A CHILDREN'S GAME AND MAKE A FORTUNE OUT OF IT 
PANEL GAMES WERE REALLY PARLOUR GAMES 
DRESSED UP AND ELABORATED ON FOR TELEVISION 
THAT'S HOW THEY STARTED 
THE TOP MEN IN THE BUSINESS OF TURNING PARLOUR GAMES INTO AMERICAN NETWORK TELEVISION SHOWS 
WERE A COUPLE OF CANNY PRODUCERS CALLED MARK GOODSON AND BILL TODMAN 
WHAT'S MY LINE WAS THEIR BIGGEST HIT 
WELCOME TO WHAT'S MY LINE IN FACT WELCOME TO OUR PREMIERE TELECAST OF WHAT'S MY LINE 
WHAT MADE IT WORK WAS SOMEONE'S GREAT IDEA MINE I'M AFRAID 
TO PLAY A GAME LIKE TWENTY QUESTIONS 
WITH THE BUSINESS OF ANALYSING AN OCCUPATION 
AND THAT COMBINATION OF THE DEDUCTIVE REASONING TOGETHER WITH THE FACE MADE THE SHOW 
THAT FLASH OF INSIGHT MADE MARK GOODSON'S FORTUNE 
HE'S IN THE GUINNESS BOOK OF RECORDS AS THE MOST PROLIFIC TELEVISION PRODUCER IN HISTORY 
WITH A TOTAL OF OVER FORTY THOUSAND SHOWS TO HIS NAME 
TO WATCH THEM ALL BACK TO BACK WOULD TAKE TWO AND A HALF YEARS 
BUT WHAT'S MY LINE WAS HIS MOST SUCCESSFUL BOTH IN THE STATES AND IN BRITAIN 
WHEN THE BRITISH VERSION LAUNCHED A YEAR AFTER THE AMERICAN PREMIERE 
GRUMPY GILBERT HARDING WAS THE PRESENTER 
HE LOOKED LIKE AN OWL WITH A MOUSTACHE 
OR LIKE A VERY ANGRY TEDDY BEAR 
HOW DO YOU DO 
THE NEW HOST LASTED ONE SHOW 
SOMEHOW THE CHALLENGERS GOT MIXED UP AND THE CALL BOY SENT ON A MALE NURSE INSTEAD OF A PANEL BEATER 
THE POOR FELLOW WHEN THEY SAID 
DO YOU USE INSTRUMENTS AND TOOLS HE SAID YES 
AND GILBERT SAID NO YOU DON'T 
IT BLEW UP INTO SUCH CHAOS THAT GILBERT SAID HE'D NEVER DO IT AGAIN 
THE NEXT WEEK EAMONN WAS IN THE CHAIR 
HE WAS SMOOTH CONFIDENT AND PROFESSIONAL AND THE SHOW'S FORTUNES BEGAN TO LOOK UP 
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL GILBERT HARDING RETURNED AS A PANELLIST A FEW WEEKS LATER 
THAT THE SHOW BECAME A REAL HIT 
I CAN REMEMBER THE ENORMOUS IMPACT IT HAD ERM 
IT WAS SUNDAY NIGHT IT WAS THE EVENT 
ALL THE CURTAINS WERE DRAWN LIGHT TURNED OUT IT WAS ABSOLUTE MAGIC 
AND THE VERY FIRST FACE I SAW WAS EAMONN ANDREWS 
AND THE FIRST SHOW WAS INDEED WHAT'S MY LINE 
I THINK THAT WE'RE BEING LED UP THE GARDEN PATH HERE CORRECT 
BRUSQUE GRUMPY GILBERT HARDING WAS THE STAR 
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE YOU GO ROUND WORKING INSTRUMENTS 
TO FIND OUT WHO'S NOT TAKEN OUT TELEVISION LICENCES 
IS THAT RIGHT 
TELEVISION HAS ALWAYS ENJOYED IRASCIBLE PEOPLE 
YOU HAVE IT NOW WITH SIMON COWELL 
SIMON COWELL IS A MODERN GILBERT HARDING 
ALL RIGHT SIMON COWELL TELLS PEOPLE TO SHUT UP HE TELLS PEOPLE HE CAN'T STAND TO LOOK AT THEM 
HE DOESN'T TRY TO HIDE HIS DISGUST AT SOME OF THE TALENTLESS GRUBBY PROLES IN FRONT OF HIM 
HE PROBABLY IS THE MODERN GILBERT HARDING 
BUT HARDING DID ALL THIS ON LIVE T. V. FIFTY YEARS AGO 
HE WAS IRRITATED THAT HE WAS TAKING PART IN THIS SILLY PROGRAMME 
AND GOT VERY CROSS AND EVERYBODY WAS DELIGHTED TO WATCH HIM BEING CROSS 
HE WAS THE CROSSEST MAN ON TELEVISION 
AND THE CROSSEST MAN ON FILM TOO 
I SUPPOSE IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU THAT I MIGHT BE USING THAT 
I NEED YOUR HELP I'M ON THE BRINK OF A TELEVISION SERIES 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHEN YOU ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE EXHIBITED IN THAT GLASS RECTANGLE 
I WELL I'LL TELL YOU YOU BECOME PUBLIC PROPERTY 
YOUR FACE ELECTRONICALLY DISTORTED 
IS HUDDLED ROUND AND GAWPED AT BY THREE QUARTERS OF THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM 
WITHIN A MONTH EVERY WRINKLE 
EVERY WART AND PUSTULE HAS BECOME PART OF OUR BRITISH WAY OF LIFE 
GILBERT WAS EVERYWHERE A MAN MADE A LIVING DOING SHADOW PUPPETS OF HIS HEAD 
AND HE WAS REGULARLY A JOKE ON THE GOONS 
TELL ME WHAT WAS IT LIKE BACK IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR 
WELL WE HAD SPORTS AND GAMES COLOURED MOVIES 
CHARLIE CHESTER MONKHOUSE GILBERT HARDING 
OOH IT WAS TERRIBLE 
AND HARDING WASN'T THE ONLY UNLIKELY STAR WHO FOUND A NEW JOB ON WHAT'S MY LINE 
ISOBEL BARNETT WAS THE TYPICAL ENGLISH DOWAGER 
WHO THE AUDIENCE WERE USED TO THEY LIKED THAT 
THEY WERE USED TO SEEING THE NEWS READ BY PEOPLE IN EVENING DRESS 
SO ISOBEL BARNETT FITTED IN VERY WELL 
ISOBEL WAS THE VERY FIRST LADY TO HAVE IN HER PASSPORT TELEVISION PANELLIST 
SHE MAY HAVE BEEN A LADY BUT SHE WAS HARDLY LANDED GENTRY 
SHE WAS A DOCTOR FROM THE EAST MIDLANDS WHOSE HUSBAND HAPPENED TO BE LORD MAYOR OF LEICESTER 
GILBERT WAS VERY IMPRESSED HE LOVED A TITLE 
ALL THE ELDERLY GENTLEMEN AND I WAS FAIRLY YOUNG AT THE TIME 
WERE IN LOVE WITH ISOBEL BARNETT 
I MEAN SHE WAS A BORN PERFORMER 
THREE GONE YOU DON'T WEAR THIS PRODUCT 
IS IT SOMETHING THAT ERM CAN BE CONSUMED 
CONSUMED YES 
SHE HAD GOT IT TO A FINE ART 
SHE'D SAY DO YOU WORK INDOORS WITH YOUR HANDS ARE YOU A SERVICE 
GET RID OF ALL THAT AND SHE'D BREAK DOWN VERY QUICKLY 
GET INTO IT MORE MORE 
AND THEN THERE WAS A SORT OF OSMOSIS WENT ON 
SHE POPS THE POPCORN 
WHEN YOU THINK OF THE WHOLE WORLD FULL OF JOBS 
TO GET IT DOWN TO THAT PERSON DOES THAT JOB IS QUITE AMAZING 
THE NEWSPAPERS WERE SURPRISED TO FIND AN INTELLIGENT ARTICULATE WOMAN ON THE NATION'S SCREENS 
SO THEY PRINTED STORIES ABOUT HER FROCKS AND EARRINGS 
FOR A WOMAN ON TELEVISION ONLY THREE THINGS REALLY MATTER HAIR JEWELLERY CLOTHES 
FELLOW PANELLIST BARBARA KELLY GOT HER EARRINGS FROM THE SAME PLACE AS ISOBEL 
THEY WERE BORROWED FROM THE PRODUCER'S WIFE 
NO ONE HAD SEEN SUCH GLAMOUR AS BARBARA KELLY 
I MEAN EARRINGS YOU KNOW YOU HAD LITTLE STUDS EARRINGS COVERED IN SEQUINS 
MY MOTHER USED TO DETEST THE WOMAN AND I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT 
YOU KNOW WE SAT ROUND IN OUR DARKENED ROOM AND MY FATHER USED TO OGLE AT BARBARA KELLY 
BUT NOT HER EARRINGS 
YOU SEE SHE ALSO HAD TWO VERY LARGE DROP PENDANT JUGS 
WHAT ABOUT CLOTHES DOES ONE PLUNGE OR DOES ONE COME UP TO HERE 
A SORT OF HAPPY MEDIUM ABOUT THERE 
ACTUALLY THERE IS A REGULATION B. B. C. PLIMSOLL LINE 
IF YOU SINK BELOW IT THEY PIN A BIT OF SACKING ACROSS 
QUITE BY ACCIDENT WHAT'S MY LINE HAD CREATED BRITAIN'S FIRST TRUE T. V. CELEBRITIES 
TO GO ON WHAT'S MY LINE WAS CERTAINLY A MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE 
FRANK AND I DID A SEASON ON WHAT'S MY LINE AND BECAUSE THEY WERE DONE LIVE 
WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF THE SHEPHERD'S BUSH THEATRE AND YOU SAW LIFE GOING ON THE TRAFFIC 
YOU WERE SLIGHTLY SURPRISED THAT EVERYTHING HADN'T STOPPED 
IT WAS FRONT PAGE NEWS ALL THE TIME WHOEVER WAS ON WHAT'S MY LINE AND WHEN I GOT IT 
THERE WAS BIG NEWS SAYING MODEL GETS WHAT'S MY LINE 
SO MANY PEOPLE WATCHED IT AND THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF PUBLICITY ABOUT IT 
AND EVEN MY BUTCHER HAD A PIECE PINNED UP ABOUT WHAT'S MY LINE 
AND HE'D SAY MAKE WAY FOR MY PIN UP GIRL 
SO I USED TO GET SPECIAL CUTS OF MEAT 
SUDDENLY WE GET A NEW KIND OF CELEBRITY 
AND THIS IS A TELEVISION CELEBRITY 
FILM STARS WERE DIFFERENT FILM STARS YOU DIDN'T KNOW THEM 
THEY WERE ICONS BUT THESE PEOPLE WERE IN YOUR POCKET 
YOU SWITCHED ON THE SET IN YOUR DRAWING ROOM AND YOU SAW THEM 
OH IT'S GILBERT OH IT'S ISOBEL BARNETT 
OH IT'S THAT LOVELY BARBARA KELLY AND YOU FELT YOU KNEW THEM 
THE AUDIENCE AND THE PRESS LOVED THESE NEW CELEBRITIES TELEPHONIES THEY WERE CALLED 
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON WHAT'S MY LINE WAS A HIT SOMETHING NO ONE HAD PREDICTED 
IT WAS THE FIRST PROGRAMME THAT THE VIEWERS SAW 
WHICH FEATURED THEM 
THEY WERE ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO APPEARED WITH UNORDINARY PEOPLE 
AND THE LINK BACK HOME THROUGH THE SCREEN WAS MAGICAL 
I NEVER FORGET I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE WILL 
IT WAS THE CONTESTANT WHO WAS A SAGGERMAKER'S BOTTOM KNOCKER 
GILBERT WAS INFURIATED THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT A SAGGERMAKER'S BOTTOM KNOCKER WAS 
AND GOT CROSS AND HIS MOUSTACHE BRISTLED 
WE FOUND OUT THAT A SAGGERMAKER'S BOTTOM KNOCKER WAS SOMETHING IN THE POTTERIES 
SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGERS NO MATTER HOW WEIRD THEIR JOB WAS 
COULD TRADE OFF THE POPULARITY OF THE SHOW 
THE B. B. C. SAW OPPORTUNITIES TOO 
WHAT'S MY LINE WAS SUCH A MANIFEST SUCCESS THAT THERE WAS A RACE 
TO FIND A SUCCESSOR OR A COMPETITOR TO IT 
AND THUS CAME THAT EXTREMELY STRANGE PERIOD WHEN THERE WAS A WHOLE RASH OF PANEL GAMES 
GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO OUR NEW GAME 
WHICH RESEMBLES A GREAT MANY OTHER GAMES YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE 
THERE'S A CHAIRMAN AND THAT'S ME 
AND THERE'S A PANEL AND I'LL INTRODUCE THEM STRAIGHT AWAY COS THEY'RE MUCH BETTER TO LOOK AT 
A SEARCH FOR NEW PANEL GAMES WAS BEGUN 
AND THE MAN GIVEN THE JOB OF FINDING THEM WAS THE B. B. C.'S QUIZ KID TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD BRIAN TESLER 
THE FIRST TO AIR WAS CALLED WHY 
IT QUICKLY EMERGED THAT NO ONE HAD AN ANSWER 
ONE OF THE PANELS WOULD REPRESENT PARENTS AND THE OTHER PANEL WOULD REPRESENT CHILDREN 
AND THEY'D GET INVOLVED IN THE AGE OLD TUSSLE BETWEEN THE CHILD 
WHO ASKS WHY EVERY TIME THE PARENT GIVES IT AN ANSWER NO MATTER WHAT THE ANSWER IS 
THE B. B. C.'S SWITCHBOARD WAS JAMMED WITH VERY RUDE CALLS FROM INDIGNANT VIEWERS 
IT WAS SO BAD EVEN OTHER PANEL GAMES NOTICED 
I'M CALLING OUR CHALLENGER MR. X. I WAS GOING TO CALL YOU MISS Y. 
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED THAT'S A NAUGHTY WORD IN T. V. WHY 
WE MADE THE HEADLINES THE NEXT DAY 
WHY WAS BROADCAST LAST NIGHT ON THE WHY 
WE PULLED THE SHOW AFTER THREE WEEKS 
YET MORE FORMATS HAD TO BE DEVISED 
THE B. B. C.'S LIME GROVE STUDIOS BECAME A PANEL GAME FACTORY 
AS BRIAN TESLER SEARCHED FOR A HIT 
THE RULES FOR SUCCESSFUL PANEL GAMES WAS SORT OF ALMOST SELF DEFINING 
I MEAN YOU NEEDED PANELLISTS WHO WERE QUICK WITTED 
BRIGHT GOOD TO LOOK AT OR AT LEAST INTERESTING TO LOOK AT 
AND A SIMPLE IDEA THERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE THAT YOU HAD A GOOD SHOW 
HOWEVER IF YOU HAD AN INSANELY COMPLICATED SHOW THINGS MIGHT GET A BIT TRICKY 
WE'VE GOT A NEW KIND OF GAME FOR TODAY 
IT'S CALLED ASK YOUR DAD WHICH JUST ABOUT EXPLAINS WHAT THE PROGRAMME IS 
WE HAVE TWO TEAMS EACH COMPOSED OF TWO DADS A SON AND A DAUGHTER 
I ASK EACH FAMILY AS IT WERE A QUESTION 
FOR THE FIRST HALF MINUTE ONLY THE SON CAN ANSWER AND IF HE GETS IT RIGHT HE GETS TWO MARKS 
AND DAD CAN HELP HIM ONLY IN MIME 
IF THE SON DOES NOT GET IT THEN THE SECOND HALF MINUTE DAD TAKES OVER AND HE CAN'T GET ANY HELP AT ALL 
IF HE GETS IT RIGHT HE ONLY GETS ONE MARK 
IF THE FAMILY CAN'T GET THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION I'LL TELL THEM WHAT IT IS AND GIVE THEM NO MARKS 
ASK YOUR DAD EVEN WITH GILBERT HARDING IN THE CHAIR NEVER REACHED A SERIES 
ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE OTHERS DID INCLUDING FIND THE LINK 
DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF A CAMBRIDGE UNDERGRADUATE ON A SUMMER JOB 
FIND THE LINK WAS A PANEL GAME WHERE THE PANEL HAD TO FIND A LINK 
BETWEEN THE PEOPLE PUT BEFORE THEM 
I WAS AT THE BACK OF THE SET AND I NEVER BOTHERED TO TURN UP FOR REHEARSALS COS I WAS DISGRACEFUL 
THE TWO PEOPLE I HAD TO PUSH ON HAD BEEN DIGGING OUT OF A PRISON CAMP IN THE TROJAN HORSE 
I HAD NO IDEA WHEN THEY WERE MEANT TO COME ON WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT JAMES MASON WHO WAS THE CELEBRITY 
WAS GOING TO STAND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND TALK TO THE COMPERE 
SO I PUSHED THESE TWO PEOPLE ON AND THEY WALKED RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF JAMES MASON AND THE COMPERE 
IF YOU WERE WATCHING T. V. AT HOME THEY WERE PUSHED ASIDE 
SOON ALL THESE NEW PANEL GAMES WERE PUSHED ASIDE TOO 
AND THE B. B. C. LOOKED TO AMERICA AND TO RADIO ONCE MORE 
GOODSON AND TODMAN PROVIDED ANOTHER PANEL GAME SUCCESS IN THE NAME'S THE SAME 
WHICH RAN ON THE HOME SERVICE BEFORE MAKING THE LEAP TO T. V. 
THE NAME'S THE SAME THE PANEL GAME THAT SHOWS YOU THAT PEOPLE ARE STRANGER THAN FICTION 
THE CONTESTANTS WERE ORDINARY PEOPLE WHOSE NAME WAS THE SAME AS 
A FAMOUS PERSON OR A THING 
MUIR AND NORDEN WERE TWO OF THE PANELLISTS 
PEOPLE CAME UP IN FRONT OF YOU 
I REMEMBER ONE CHAP'S NAME WAS IVOR HANDLE 
AND ANOTHER ONE WAS TERESA GREEN 
AND YOU HAD TO GUESS YOU HAD TO ELICIT THIS NAME 
YOU GO RATHER FAR BACK IN HISTORY DO YOU 
OOH YES BUT NOT TOO FAR BACK 
ER I'LL SAY YOU ARE SHAKESPEARE 
THERE WAS ONE MOMENT WHEN FRANK AND I JUST LOOKED AT EACH OTHER QUITE BY CHANCE OUR EYES MET 
AND WE SAW THE SAME KIND OF DESPAIR IN EACH OTHER'S EYES 
YOU KNOW BOTH OUR PARENTS HAD SACRIFICED AND SCRAPED TO SEND US TO GOOD SCHOOLS TO GET A GOOD EDUCATION 
AND WE YOU KNOW TERESA GREEN 
ARE YOU IN THIS ROOM NOW 
YES 
ARE YOU ON THIS PANEL 
I AM 
ARE YOU ME 
WHILE THESE PARLOUR GAMES WERE BY TURNS ENTERTAINING AND OUTRAGING THE AUDIENCE 
ANOTHER PANEL SHOW WAS QUIETLY MAKING CELEBRITIES OUT OF SOME EVEN MORE UNLIKELY FIGURES 
ANIMAL VEGETABLE MINERAL NOTHING TO DO WITH TWENTY QUESTIONS 
WAS A HOME GROWN FORMAT IN WHICH THREE EXPERTS EXAMINED A VARIETY OF OBJECTS AND TRIED TO IDENTIFY THEM 
IT IS A POT IN THE ACT OF SURRENDERING WITH ITS ARMS RIGHT UP 
IT'S A LADY POT A LADY POT 
ERM IT'S A POT I SHOULD THINK OF THE NEOLITHIC PERIOD 
WHY BECAUSE IT'S TOO BAD TO BE ANYTHING ELSE 
IT WAS CHAIRED BY CAMBRIDGE PROFESSOR GLYN DANIEL AND FEATURED A GALLERY OF ACADEMICS 
WITH EXTRAORDINARY BRAINS NAMES AND FACES 
INCLUDING PROFESSOR GORDON CHILD 
WELL I TOO THINK IT'S A LADY POT YOU MUSTN'T LOOK TOO CAREFULLY AT THE BACK SIDE OF IT 
IS IT A LADY THE BREASTS ARE QUITE CONSPICUOUS 
I KNOW VERY FEW LADIES THAT LOOK LIKE THAT 
WE HAD THIS MARVELLOUS LYNCHPIN OF A MAN IN SIR MORTIMER WHEELER 
WHO WAS VERY ELEGANT 
HE LOOKED LIKE EVERYBODY'S PERCEPTION OF A VICTORIAN GENERAL WITH A GRAND MUSTACHIO 
THIS IS ONE OF THE TWO BEST EXAMPLES THAT I KNOW 
ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAY IN WHICH AN EMPHATIC MOUSTACHE 
CAN REDEEM A SOMEWHAT INTRACTABLE COUNTENANCE 
HE WAS A VERY DISTINGUISHED ARCHAEOLOGIST 
AND HE HAD IN HIS CAREER BEEN AT MOST IMPORTANT DIGS IN THE COUNTRY 
SO HE KNEW ALL THE MATERIAL 
BUT HE WAS SUFFICIENT OF A PERFORMER NOT TO LET ON 
SO HE'D SAY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WELL BECAUSE IT'S THIS IT MUST HAVE COME FROM THERE 
AND IF IT CAME FROM THERE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SUCH AND SUCH 
AND FINALLY HE'D IDENTIFY IT AND THEN HE'D REVEAL HE'D DUG IT UP IN THE FIRST PLACE 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT T. V. IN THAT TIME 
WERE THE TYPE OF PEOPLE USED ON T. V. 
HAD HAD A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 
BEFORE THEY EVER GOT ANYWHERE NEAR T. V. 
A LOT OF THEM WERE VERY WISE PEOPLE 
LIKE THE BRAINS TRUST 
ANIMAL VEGETABLE MINERAL WAS THE VERY ESSENCE OF IMPROVING REITHIAN BROADCASTING 
BUT IT TOOK UNTIL NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE FOR THE BRAINS TRUST ITSELF TO FINALLY TRANSFER TO T. V. 
IT NEVER QUITE GOT THE AUDIENCE IT DID ON RADIO 
ERM BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW REALLY WHY BUT I MEAN IT DID VERY WELL 
BUT IT WASN'T THE SENSATION THAT IT HAD BEEN ON THE RADIO 
BY THE TIME THE BRAINS TRUST ARRIVED ON THE SCREEN 
THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE B. B. C. PANEL GAME WAS COMING TO AN END 
GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME AGAIN TO THE BRAINS TRUST 
PARNELL KERR OR KARR OF EWELL SURREY WRITES WHY ARE MODERN COMPOSERS SO AFRAID OF A TUNE 
MUSIC IS EITHER GOOD OR BAD 
IT MAY BE GOOD SUPERFICIALLY LIKE SO MUCH OF THE POPULAR MUSIC WHICH LIVES A VERY HECTIC LIFE 
AND DIES VERY QUICKLY OR IT MAY BE GOOD FOR ALL TIME LIKE THE BEST OF THE CLASSICS WHICH WILL EXIST 
HAVE EXISTED FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND WILL EXIST 
BUT RADIO'S FIRST PANEL GAME HIT WAS TO BE T. V.'S LAST 
I. T. V. WAS COMING AND THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT 
THERE WAS THE FEELING THAT THE NATION WAS ABOUT TO BE BASTARDISED WAS ABOUT TO BE DEMEANED 
TWO WEEKS AFTER THE BRAINS TRUST LAUNCHED ON B. B. C. T. V. I. T. V. ARRIVED 
IT KNOCKED THE B. B. C. FOR SIX 
THEY DID NOT ANTICIPATE THE EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS THAT THIS DUMBING DOWN WOULD BRING 
THE PUBLIC LOVED THE ENTERTAINMENT VALUES AND THE FUN 
OBVIOUSLY THE B. B. C. WERE CONSTRAINED WHEN THEY HAD TO COMPETE WITH GAME SHOWS 
BECAUSE THAT WAS MATTER OF GIVING PRIZES AND THE MORE PRIZE MONEY YOU GAVE 
PRESUMABLY THE MORE VIEWERS YOU GAINED 
THE B. B. C. PANEL SHOWS THAT HAD ENTERTAINED THE NATION FOR A DECADE WERE STARTING TO LOOK TIRED 
AND SO WERE THE STARS 
GILBERT HARDING WAS ILL AND UNHAPPY 
THERE WAS NOTHING HE WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE THAN TO WALK AWAY FROM WHAT'S MY LINE AND HE DID TRY 
HERE WAS A MAN WHO WAS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT 
BECOMING HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL VERY WELL KNOWN 
FOR REASONS WHICH HE DESPISED 
FOR ASKING A LOT OF SILLY QUESTIONS 
PLAYING A RATHER CHILDISH PARLOUR GAME 
IT WAS T. V. THAT MADE GILBERT HARDING 
AND IT WAS T. V. THAT FINALLY BROKE HIM 
ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY MOMENTS IN T. V. HISTORY WAS AN EDITION OF THE PROGRAMME FACE TO FACE 
FACE TO FACE WAS A SERIES 
WHICH WAS CONDUCTED BY A MAN CALLED JOHN FREEMAN 
WHO WAS CONSIDERED A VERY SKILLED INTERVIEWER 
AND IT WAS CONDUCTED IN A STUDIO WITH BLACK DRAPES ALL ROUND THE SET 
WHICH WAS PRIMARILY TWO CHAIRS AND A TABLE BETWEEN THEM 
THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THE ATMOSPHERE WAS AN INTENSE ONE 
AND GILBERT HARDING BROKE DOWN UNDER WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED INTERROGATION 
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN WITH A PERSON DYING YES ONLY ONCE 
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT MM 
SOMEONE VERY CLOSE TO YOU MM 
DID IT MAKE A VIVID IMPRESSION IT DID YES 
HE PRESSED GILBERT 
ABOUT HIS CAREER AND HOW HE'D SPENT HIS LIFE 
AND ABOUT HIS AFFECTION FOR HIS MOTHER 
AND THE FACT THAT HE WAS PROBABLY A SUPPRESSED HOMOSEXUAL THOUGH WHO KNOWS 
ERM AND IN THE END REDUCED HIM TO TEARS 
IN THOSE DAYS THAT WAS A VERY UNUSUAL THING TO HAPPEN 
AND ERM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DISAPPROVED OF IT VERY MUCH 
THEY THOUGHT THAT JOHN FREEMAN HAD BEEN BRUTAL 
HAVE YOU FOUND A WAY OF LIFE WHICH MAKES YOU HAPPY AND GIVES YOU FULFILMENT NO 
WHAT'S LACKING OH I THINK THE THING THAT'S REALLY LACKING IS A SENSE OF PURPOSE YOU KNOW 
THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT IN ASKING PEOPLE WHETHER THEY'RE COAL HEAPERS FROM WIGAN 
OR CHIMNEY SWEEPERS FROM STOKE ON TRENT 
NOR EVEN IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS FROM DIMBLEBY AND TRAIN 
ON WHETHER THE OBJECT IS ANIMAL VEGETABLE OR MINERAL 
EIGHT WEEKS AFTER THAT INTERVIEW 
GILBERT HARDING COLLAPSED AND DIED AFTER A RECORDING OF ROUND BRITAIN QUIZ HE WAS FIFTY THREE 
I THINK EVERYBODY FELT A LITTLE BIT GUILTY 
BECAUSE WE HAD ALL ENJOYED THE SPORT IN THE AMPHITHEATRE WITH GILBERT THE GLADIATOR 
SOON AFTER HE DIED GILBERT HARDING'S WAXWORK IN MADAME TUSSAUD'S 
WAS MELTED DOWN TO MAKE ONE OF CHRISTINE KEELER 
HE WAS NO LONGER THE MOST FAMOUS PERSON IN BRITAIN 
HARDING'S WASN'T THE LAST TRAGEDY OF WHAT'S MY LINE 
ORIGINAL PANELLIST JERRY DESMOND TOOK HIS OWN LIFE FOLLOWING A BAD BUSINESS DEAL IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN 
AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY LADY ISOBEL BARNETT WHO WAS SO LONG SEEMINGLY ABOVE THE CARES OF THE WORLD 
WAS CONVICTED OF SHOPLIFTING EIGHTY SEVEN PENCE WORTH OF GOODS FROM HER LOCAL VILLAGE SHOP 
HOW MUCH OF AN ORDEAL WAS IT FOR YOU HORRIBLE 
A VERY CONSIDERABLE ORDEAL 
ERM I HAVE ONLY MYSELF TO LIVE WITH AND AT LEAST I CAN LIVE WITH MYSELF 
BUT LIVING WITH HERSELF WAS ONE THING SHE COULDN'T DO 
TWO DAYS AFTER HER TRIAL LADY ISOBEL BARNETT T. V.'S FIRST PROFESSIONAL PANELLIST 
TOOK HER OWN LIFE 
WHAT'S MY LINE HAS REAPPEARED A FEW TIMES OVER THE DECADES 
BUT IT WAS NEVER AS POPULAR AS IN THE YEARS OF GILBERT ISOBEL AND BARBARA 
ALTHOUGH PANEL GAMES NEVER REALLY WENT AWAY IT WAS THIRTY YEARS BEFORE THEY RETURNED TO PRIME TIME 
WITH ANOTHER COLLECTION OF CLOWNS SMOOTHIES AND GRUMPS 
WHAT'S COMMON TO THE D. N. A. OF WHAT'S MY LINE AND HAVE I GOT NEWS 
IS IT'S AN EXCUSE FOR INTELLIGENT PEOPLE TO TALK INTELLIGENTLY 
SO WHETHER YOU'RE TRYING TO GUESS SOMEBODY'S JOB OR YOU'RE COMMENTING ON A NEWS ITEM 
WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS HOPEFULLY WITTY AND INTELLIGENT PEOPLE EXERCISING THEIR WIT AND INTELLIGENCE 
THAT'S WHY YOU WATCH THEM 
GLAMOUR COMEDY SORT OF PSEUDO INTELLECTUALS IF YOU LIKE GRUMPY OLD THING TOO 
ALL THERE IN ONE GO 
AND IF YOU PUT ANIMAL VEGETABLE MINERAL OUT ON T. V. NOW 
IT'D PROBABLY BE HERALDED AS A GREAT BREAKTHROUGH 
BETTER THAN BIG BROTHER 
THIS IS WHAT IT IS 
IT'S A REALLY SIGNIFICANT THING THE SEXUAL PARTS AND BREASTS AT ANY RATE ARE CONSPICUOUS 
DO YOU KNOW MANY WOMEN LIKE THAT OH NO NO
