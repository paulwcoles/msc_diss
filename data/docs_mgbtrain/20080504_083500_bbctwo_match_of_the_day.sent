HELLO IT IS THE PENULTIMATE 
WEEKEND OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
SEASON AND IT COULD HARDLY BE 
TIGHTER AT BOTH ENDS OF THE TABLE 
ON MATCH OF THE DAY THIS WEEK WE 
WILL SEE THE LEAGUE LEADERS AND 
ALL THOSE UNDER THREAT OF THE DROP 
ALL THAT AND THE APRIL GOAL OF THE 
MONTH COMPETITION ALAN HANSEN AND 
ALAN SHEARER CAN HARDLY CONTAIN 
THEIR EXCITEMENT WE START WITH THE 
CHAMPIONS MANCHESTER UNITED TO 
DEFEND THEIR CROWN ALL THAT WAS 
REQUIRED WAS TWO VICTORIES BUT THE 
FIRST WAS AGAINST THEIR BOGY SIDE 
WEST HAM WHO HAVE BEATEN THEM ON 
THEIR LAST THREE MEETINGS TWO TROPHIES TO BE DECIDED IN THREE 
GAMES THE TITLE RACE STARTS TODAY 
AND THEN ITS MOSCOW THIS SEASON 
DISTILLED INTO TWENTY FIVE WEEKS FOR 
MANCHESTER UNITED SO IS THE 
ADRENALIN OF VICTORY STILL COURSING 
THROUGH THEIR VEINS OR IS THEIR 
GRIP ON THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
WEAKENING THE NEXT NINETY MINUTES WILL 
BE TELLING AND MAY BE DECISIVE 
MANCHESTER UNITED ARE UNCHANGED 
NEMANJA VIDIC AND WAYNE ROONEY ARE 
STILL BOTH OUT SIR ALEX FERGUSON 
INSISTS THAT ROONEY WILL BE FIT FOR 
MOSCOW WEST HAM MAKE TWO CHANGES FREDDIE 
LJUNGBERG'S RIBS SEE HIM MISSING 
OUT ONCE AGAIN ALAN CURBISHLEY WILL PROBABLY WISH 
HE HAD KEPT HIS THOUGHTS ON THE 
TITLE TO HIMSELF THIS WEEK SIXTEEN 
TIMES CHAMPIONS OF ENGLAND 
MANCHESTER UNITED TWO GAMES AWAY 
FROM THE TITLE AGAIN WEST HAM HAVE BEEN THEIR NEMESIS IN 
RECENT YEARS AND THEY ARE 
LAUNCHING THE FIRST ATTACK THAT 
WAS ZAMORA RONALDO CRISTIANO RONALDO ONE TO ZERO 
MANCHESTER UNITED IT TOOK A 
DEFLECTION IT BEAT ROBERT GREEN 
IT IS THIRTY NINE GOALS FOR THE SEASON FOR 
RONALDO AND IT'S A STRIDE TOWARDS THE TITLE THREE MINUTES ON THE CLOCK AND THE NERVES IF THERE WERE ANY 
HAVE EVAPORATED AROUND OLD TRAFFORD 
JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED CRISTIANO RONALDO WHO ELSE PROVIDES HEADED AWAY BY BROWN IT'S A CORNER 
TO WEST HAM VAN DER SAR NEEDED HELP FROM EVRA TO HER KIT OFF THE LINE TO HOOK IT OFF THE LINE THEY HAVE LOST FOUR OF THEIR LAST 
FIVE AWAY FROM HOME WEST HAM THE 
OTHER WAS AL DRAW AND 
THE SHEIKH OF THE HEAD SUGGESTS THAT ALAN 
CURBISHLEY IS ALREADY FEARING THE 
WORST HERE HANDBALL BY WES BROWN 
WELL HE WAS PUSHED INTO IT BY 
ZAMORA THAT IS THE DECISION OF 
MIKE RILEY OTHERWISE THAT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN A PENALTY PARK FINDS TEVEZ THE CLEARANCE HEAR FROM JAMES 
TOMKINS THE NINETEEN YEAR OLD FINDING 
HIMSELF ON THE BIGGEST STAGE OF HIS 
CAREER IT WAS A BIG MOMENT FOR A 
YOUNGSTER FACING HIS OWN NET TOMKINS MISSED IT CRISTIANO 
RONALDO HAS FORTY AND MANCHESTER 
UNITED HAVE TWO WHAT AN 
EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENT FROM AN 
EXTRAORDINARY FOOTBALLER FORTY GOALS WITHOUT EVEN PLAYING 
AS A STRIKER PART OF THE TIME TEVEZ IT'S A ROMP FOR MANCHESTER UNITED AS THEY STRIDE TOWARDS THE FINISH 
LINE AND CARLOS TEVEZ WHO SCORED 
THE GOAL THAT KEPT WEST HAM IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE LAST SEASON 
UNLEASHES A SUPERB SHOT INTO THE 
BACK OF THE WEST HAM UNITED NET AND EVEN THE WEST HAM FANS MANAGED TO SMILE AT THE SIGHT OF THIS DEAN ASHTON A MAGNIFICENT GOAL WHATEVER MANCHESTER UNITED DO TODAY 
THEY WILL DO WELL TO SCORE A BETTER 
GOAL THAN THAT BROWN'S MISTAKE BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS FOR A FINISH FROM DEAN ASHTON ASHTON THE PROBLEM WOULD LOOK TO 
BE MAYBE WITH HIS GROIN OR FIVE IT 
WAS ACROBATIC MAYBE TOO ACROBATIC NANI THOUGHT ABOUT THE SPECTACULAR 
COULD NOT EXECUTED AND NANI HAS 
STUCK HIS FOREHEAD INTO LUCAS NEILL 
WHAT DID MIKE RILEY SEA OF THAT SEE BACK NANI THINKS WHAT HAVE 
I DONE HERE I HAD BETTER GO DOWN 
TOO NANI STUCK HIS FOREHEAD INTO LUCAS 
NEILL HE MAY HAVE BEEN SLAPPED HE 
MAY GET A RED CARD I'M AFRAID FOR NANI THE PLAY 
ACTING HAS NOT SAVED HIM HE IS 
SENT OFF WHILST MIKE DEAN THE FOURTH 
OFFICIAL HERE'S THE OPINION OF SIR 
ALEX FERGUSON IT HAS TO BE THE 
RIGHT DECISION PANTSIL CAME IN FROM THE RIGHT WAYNE ROONEY IS A SPECTATOR TODAY 
BUT SIR ALEX FERGUSON HAS SAID IT 
IS NONSENSE TO SUGGEST THAT HE 
NEEDS AN OPERATION NONSENSE TO 
SUGGEST THAT HE WOULD MISS THE 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE FINAL NEMANJA 
VIDIC ALONGSIDE BOTH MISSING TODAY MICHAEL CARRICK AGAINST HIS FORMER CLUB AND THAT 
SURELY ENDS THE HOPES OF HIS FORMER 
CLUB ANOTHER DEFLECTION DOES MANCHESTER 
UNITED'S WAY BUT IT'S FOUR TO ONE AND IT 
IS GOING TO BE THEIR DAY PARK JI SUNG IS REPLACED BY RYAN 
GIGGS SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN MANCHESTER UNITED 
APPEARANCES HE MAY SURPASS THE 
RECORD OF BOBBY CHARLTON IN MOSCOW FLETCHER IT IS OFF THE INSIDE OF THE POST GREAT COUNTER ATTACKING MOVEMENT FROM 
MANCHESTER UNITED MIKE RILEY'S WHISTLE MEANS THAT IF MANCHESTER UNITED WIN AT WIGAN NEXT 
WEEKEND THEY ARE CHAMPIONS AGAIN 
AND NOTHING CHELSEA DO WILL MAKE A 
JOT OF DIFFERENCE CRISTIANO 
RONALDO WITH TWO TEVEZ AND CARRICK 
WITH THE OTHERS MANCHESTER UNITED 
WITH TEN MEN FOR MORE THAN HALF THE 
GAME SWEPT WEST HAM UNITED ASIDE 
THE STRETFORD END WILL NOT SEE 
SILVERWARE TODAY 
SURELY 
WILL SOON 
AND SO DELIGHTED WITH THAT RESULT 
WAS ALEX FERGUSON THAT AFTER THE 
GAME HE SPOKE TO MATCH OF THE DAY 
FIRST OF ALL I THINK WE SHOULD 
APPLAUD THE EFFORTS OF OUR PLAYERS 
THIS SEASON THEY HAVE BEEN 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
SO AS THE LADS MAKE THEIR LAP OF 
HONOUR IN TRIBUTE TO YOU THE FANS 
ENJOY YOURSELVES IN MOSCOW AND 
HOPEFULLY NEXT WEEK AT WIGAN WELL 
DONE 
FORTY GOALS THIS SEASON THAT'S DONE MAGNIFICENT 
YEAH IT'S WONDERFUL MAGNIFICENT FOR ME IT HAS BEEN A GREAT SEASON 
I SCORE MANY GOALS AND WE ARE A IN 
A GOOD POSITION WE'RE IN THE FINAL 
IN THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE IF WE WIN 
THE NEXT GAME AGAINST WIGAN WE ARE 
CHAMPIONS FOR ME IT IS A 
SPECTACULAR SEASON 
FIRST ALAN 
CURBISHLEY ANY PARTICULAR 
DISAPPOINTMENT 
THERE IS NO DISAPPOINTMENT ULTERIOR MOTIVE ALAN JUST ASKED ME 
TO DO THE PRESS WHICH I HAVE DONE 
ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS L. DID NOT 
REALLY SEE THE INCIDENT BUT HE 
SAID HE PUSHED HIS HEAD INTO LUCAS 
NEILL'S FACE L. DON'T KNOW ONCE 
THEY SCORED THE FOURTH FROM THE 
DEFECTION IT WAS AN UPHILL BATTLE 
BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD 
HAVE COME BACK FROM 
ONE GAME TO GO 
IF WE WIN IT WE'LL WIN THE LEAGUE 
IF YOU HAD GIVEN THAT TO US AT THE 
START OF THE SEASON WE WOULD HAVE 
TAKEN IT WE HAVE JUST GOT TO 
FINISH THE JOB 
THAT WAS EASIER THAN WE EXPECTED 
IT'S THE DIEP OF THE GAME WHEN YOU 
ARE GOING FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP THAT 
YOU RELISH WEST HAM BASICALLY 
DIDN'T TURN UP A THIS YEAR IT WAS 
THE OPPOSITE UNITE READY FIGHTING 
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP AND THEY WERE 
SORT OF RESIGNED TO MID TABLE 
MEDIOCRITY THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A 
BEACH SOMEWHERE IT SHOWED IN THEIR 
PERFORMANCE THEY NEVER GOT TIGHT 
ENOUGH QUICK ENOUGH RONALDO SCORES 
AFTER FOUR MINUTES AND AFTER THAT 
IT WAS LIKE JUST A PROCESSION WHERE 
YOU KNEW WEST HAM WERE NOT GOING TO 
CAUSE THEM ANY PROBLEMS THE 
DEFENDING FOR THE GOALS IN ALL 
HONESTY WAS REALLY REALLY POOR 
THE FIRST GOAL WITH LUCAS NEILL 
HERE YOU HAVE TO CONCENTRATE AND 
FOCUS AND DON'T LET RONALDO GET 
AWAY FROM YOU LUCAS NEILL GOT SQUARE TO RONALDO 
HE DOESN'T GET ACROSS QUICK ENOUGH 
WHEN HE IS SQUARE TO THE TARGET 
HE'S IN TROUBLE HE'S IN BIG BIG 
TROUBLE WHEN RONALDO COMES INSIDE 
MCCARTNEY HE HAS TO COME TO THE 
BALL BUT HE LETS RONALDO COME AND 
COME HE BACKS OFF BACKS OFF AND 
IT'S IN THE BACK OF THE NET A 
GREAT GOAL FROM MANCHESTER UNITED'S 
PERSPECTIVE LOOK AT ROBERT GREEN 
HE CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT IS GOING ON 
HERE THAT'S FOUR MINUTES INTO THE 
MATCH THEN TWENTY MINUTES LATER 
THEY'RE JUST AMBLING OUT THERE 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEFEND IT TOMKINS 
FOR SOME REASON GETS BENEATH IT 
RONALDO GOOD BIT OF MOVEMENT 
THERE THEN THREE TO ONE AGAINST TEN MEN 
YOU EXPECT THEM TO COME BACK YOU 
WATCH CARRICK HERE A DIFFICULT 
BALL TO CONTROL HE PICKS UP ONE 
TOUCH TWO TOUCH THREE FOUR NO 
CHALLENGE DEFLECTION IN THE BACK 
OF THE NET IT'S ALL OVER FROM A 
WEST HAM POINT OF VIEW IT WAS VERY 
VERY POOR 
FOR UNITED THEY DID 
WHAT THEY HAD TO DO ONE BLOT ON 
THEIR COPYBOOK FOR NANI I'D I'D SUGGEST THAT SIR ALEX FERGUSON 
WOULD HAVE GONE BALLISTIC FOR THIS 
LUCAS NEILL GETS IT THERE JUST 
THERE AND THEN MAYBE SLAPS HIM A 
BIT YOU CAN'T DEFEND THAT AT ALL 
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY AND THEN 
WATCH HIM GO OVER HERE IT'S LIKE A 
BAFTA AND AN OS COUNCIL TAX HE'S 
NUTTED HIM AND THEN THEY HIT A 
BATTLE ALL RIGHT A RETRIBUTION 
BECAUSE LUCAS NEILL HAD A GO AT HIM 
BUT INDEFENSIBLE ABSOLUTELY CRAZY 
BUT HE GETS AWAY WITH IT 
HE KEPT 
WEST HAM UP LAST SEASON BUT TEVEZ 
TODAY DID IT AT THE OTHER END NO 
DOUBT OF THE QUALITY OF THAT JUST JUST A TOP BLOKE HE DONE THAT FOR WEST 
HAM LAST YEAR BUT IT WAS ROLES 
REVERSED THIS YEAR NICE BALL IN 
FROM RONALDO HE FOLLOWS THE PASS 
CREATES THE SPACE AND MULLINS LETS 
HIM COME INSIDE FATALLY INVITES 
HIM TO SHOOT DOESN'T NEED A SECOND 
OPPORTUNITY TO DO IN WHAT A 
FANTASTIC STRIKE THAT IS NOT MANY 
HOME PLAYERS GET A RECEPTION LIKE 
THAT FROM AWAY FANS AT OLD TRAFFORD 
HE DESERVES IT AFTER WHAT HE DID 
FOR WEST HAM 
WE HAVE SEEN GREAT 
MANAGEMENT FROM FERGUSON WE 
WATCHED THEM PLAY AGAINST CHELSEA 
LAST WEEK HE CAME OUT IN THE PRESS 
ANY NEGATIVES NOT A HINT OF 
NEGATIVITY NO MENTION OF BEING 
TIRED NO MENTION OF INJURIES HE 
HAS COME OUT AND HAS BEEN 
UNBELIEVABLY POSITIVE IT'S PAID 
REWARDS 
CHELSEA HAVE IT ALL TO DO REWARDS AGAINST YOUR MOB FOR A START ON ON MONDAY IT WILL BE A LOT TOUGHER 
THAN MANCHESTER UNITED'S GAME WAS 
TODAY I CAN PROMISE NEWCASTLE 
SEVEN UNBEATEN SO IT WILL BE TOUGH 
I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST THEM TO GO 
THERE AND TAKE IT TO THE WIRE FOR 
THE LAST GAME OF THE SEASON 
IT'S TIGHT 
UNITED AGAINST WIGAN 
UNITED IN POLE POSITION THEY HAVE 
TWO GAMES THEY HAVE DONE THE 
BUSINESS TODAY THEY GO TO WIGAN 
NEXT WEEK IT'S THEIRS FOR THE TAKE 
IT CERTAINLY IS FROM HERE ON IN 
IT'S THE QUESTION OF RELEGATION 
THAT CONCENTRATES OUR THOUGHTS NO 
QUESTION WAS THE MOST CRUCIAL GAME 
OF THE DAY NINETEENTH PLACE FULHAM 
AGAINST EIGHTEENTH PLACE BIRMINGHAM AT A 
TENSE CRAVEN COTTAGE HERE'S JOHN 
MOTSON MOTSON DIOMANSY KAMARA'S REWARD FOR HIS 
TWO GOALS THAT TURNED LAST WEEK'S 
GAME AT MANCHESTER CITY IS A PLACE 
IN THE FULHAM STARTING LINE UP 
ONLY A WIN WILL DO IS THE MESSAGE 
FROM THE COTTAGERS IRONICALLY THE 
BIRMINGHAM GOALKEEPER MAIK TAYLOR 
SPENT SEVEN SEASONS AT FULHAM 
MAKING AROUND TWO HUNDRED APPEARANCES AND 
HELPING HIM ACHIEVE THE PREMIERSHIP 
STATUS THAT BOTH CLUBS COULD NOW 
LOSE LOSE TWO WORRIED MEN ON THE TOUCHLINE 
TODAY ALEX MCLEISH THE MANAGER OF 
BIRMINGHAM CITY THEY HAVEN'T HAD 
AN AWAY WIN SINCE HIS FIRST GAME AT 
TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR 
ON THE FULHAM BENCH THERE ROY 
HODGSON AND RAY LEWINGTON THEY 
KNOW A WIN IS ESSENTIAL KAMARA FOR 
DAVID HEALY IS THE ONLY FULHAM 
CHANGE A YEAR AGO TODAY CLINT 
DEMPSEY SCORED THE GOAL WHICH BEAT 
LIVERPOOL HERE AND SECURED PREMIER 
LEAGUE FOOTBALL AT THE COTTAGE FOR 
ANOTHER YEAR CAN THEY FIND A HERO 
TODAY TODAY BIRMINGHAM CAPTAIN DAMIAN JOHNSON 
RETURNS IN MIDFIELD AFTER THE 
THREE MATCH BAN RIGHTBACK STEPHEN 
KELLY PASSED A FITNESS TEST TO 
PROTECT HIS RECORD OF BEING THE 
ONLY OUTFIELD PLAYER TO TAKE PART 
IN EVERY MINUTE OF PREMIER LEAGUE 
FOOTBALL THIS SEASON FULHAM MOVING NICELY HERE THIS IS 
SIMON DAVIES 
DEMPSEY NEAR POST POLLARD HERE 
MCBRIDE OFFSIDE WAS HE OFFSIDE I THINK MAIK TAYLOR 
MAY HAVE FINGERTIPED THAT ON TO THE 
BAR BAR THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE WHITE HAIR 
THERE IS PETER CHAPLAIN WHO IS 
JUST APPROACHING HIS EIGHTY EIGHTH BIRTHDAY 
HE WAS ACTUALLY BORN IN CRAVEN 
COTTAGE IN NINETEEN TWENTY LIVED THERE FOR 
THE FIRST ELEVEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE 
WHILE HIS FATHER ALEC WAS CAPTAIN 
OF FULHAM PETER HAS NOT BEEN BACK 
AT THE GROUND FOR SEVENTY SIX YEARS FOUL 
DAVIES CHECKED THERE ON THE EDGE OF 
THE BOX BEFORE THE PLAY WENT ON 
FULHAM HAD HAVE A FREE KICK HERE 
AND A THREATENING POSITION BULLARD IS SOMETHING OF A FREE KICK SPECIALIST SPECIALIST MCBRIDE IS TRYING TO UNTANGLE 
HIMSELF FROM RIDGEWELL BULLARD 
PLAYS IT SHORTER DAVIES WHAT A 
FINE SAVE BY MAIK TAYLOR 
THE FREE KICK WAS WELL DISGUISED 
BUT THAT WAS A SUPREME PIECE OF 
GOAL KEEPING IT THWARTS FULHAM 
SIMON DAVIES MUST HAVE THOUGHT THAT 
WAS ON ITS WAY IN 
THAT'S DANGEROUS IT'S SNAPPED UP 
BY LARSSON FOR BIRMINGHAM TO 
MCFADDEN AND NOW KELLY THE 
RIGHTBACK HAS MADE A GREAT RUN ON 
THE FAR SIDE JAMES MCFADDEN HAS 
FOUND LARSSON KELLY IS STILL THERE 
OH MIKAEL FORSELL A PIECE OF 
MISCONTROL BUT SURELY WELL IT 
MIGHT PLAYING HIM A BIT IT WAS A 
REAL CHANCE FOR BIRMINGHAM CITY 
THEY WERE MOVING WELL WITH FOUR MEN 
UP AND FORSELL HERE THE FULHAM 
DEFENDER HAD SLIPPED BUT FORSELL 
COULDN'T GET THE BALL UNDER CONTROL 
THE FULHAM OWNER MOHAMED AL FAYED 
WENT INTO THE DRESSING ROOM TO 
SPEAK TO THE PLAYERS BEFORE THE 
GAME TODAY MCFADDEN HAS GOT IN BEHIND AARON 
HUGHES AND FORSELL OH HUGHES 
WELL REAL GOOD INTELLIGENT 
DEFENDING BY AARON HUGHES AT ONE 
MOMENT HE WAS CHASING MCFADDEN HE 
HAD SEEN THE DANGER HE PREVENTED 
FORSELL FROM GETTING ON THE END OF 
IT WATCH HUGHES HERE HOW HE 
CRISS CROSSS JUST ENOUGH THERE 
THE FULHAM FANS ARE DOING THEIR 
VERY BEST TO BRING A FEEL GOOD 
FACTOR TO THIS OCCASION BEHIND ALL 
OF THAT THERE IS SO MUCH TENSION A NEAR POST BALL A CHANCE FOR KAMARA KAMARA FELL IN FRONT OF HIM A BACK HEEL BY DANNY MURPHY IT 
DIDN'T QUITE WORK WAS FOULED 
CHRIS FOY DOESN'T THINK SO A 
YELLOW CARD FOR STELTERI I THINK 
FOR STIMULATION WHAT A GOOD DIVING BY THE CENTRE BACK MCBRIDE TOOK ONE ON THE SIDE OF THE 
HEAD FROM JAIDI THERE 
A FREE KICK TO FULHAM JIMMY 
BULLARD TERRITORY NO DOUBT 
MCBRIDE COMING IN FULHAM SCORED 
FULHAM SCORED WHO ELSE COULD IT BE 
BUT BRIAN MCBRIDE 
SEVEN MINUTES INTO THE SECOND HALF 
IS THIS A PREMIERSHIP LIFELINE FOR 
FULHAM FULHAM MCBRIDE WHO THEY'VE MISSED SO 
BADLY WHEN HE WAS OUT FROM AUGUST 
TO JANUARY BUT THIS IS AN 
ABSOLUTELY TYPICAL GOAL FROM HIM 
BULLARD CURLS THE FREE KICK IN AND 
MCBRIDE LOOK AT THAT THE 
PLACEMENT OF IT SUDDENLY THEY'RE 
SOME OPTIMISM AROUND CRAVEN COTTAGE 
A ROAR GOING UP AT THE HAMMERSMITH 
END FULHAM SUPPORTERS CELEBRATE 
THE GOAL AND THE POSSIBILITY AND 
THAT IS ALL IT IS AT THE MOMENT AT 
THIS STAGE FOR ROY HODGSON OF 
SURVIVAL SURVIVAL THIS IS KAMARA 
FULHAM HAVE PLAYERS COMING UP TO 
HIS RIGHT GOOD SKILL FROM KAMARA 
BRILLIANT WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN 
NEXT IT WAS FROM THE SUBLIME TO 
THE RIDICULOUS REALLY 
HE CARRIED THIS QUITE 
BLUETONGUEFULLY BLUETONGUEFULLY MAYBE ON SECOND THOUGHTS HE COULD 
HAVE SQUARED IT 
THE BIG FEAR FOR FULHAM NOW IS 
THEIR FANS ARE ONLY TOO AWARE IS 
THEY'VE CONCEDED A HUGE NUMBER OF 
LATE GOALS THIS SEASON SOMETHING 
WHICH ROY HODGSON WILL BE PRAYING 
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN TODAY FULHAM ARE GOING TO MAKE A CHANGE 
BECAUSE KAMARA IS INJURED ERIK 
NEVLAND THE NORWEGIAN WHO SCORED 
AT READING RECENTLY FOR FULHAM IS 
COMING ON TO REPLACE HIM DEMPSEY'S HEADER GOES OVER THE BAR 
YOU REALLY FEEL A SECOND GOAL FOR 
FULHAM WOULD TIE IT UP NOW IF IT 
DOESN'T COME THE ANXIETY AT THE 
OTHER END WILL INCREASE 
THE BIRMINGHAM FANS KNOWING THAT 
TIME IS NOT ON THEIR SIDE CAN FULHAM HOLD FIRM 
DAVID MURPHY HAS ARRIVED IN THE 
PENALTY AREA NOW JAIDI HOW DID 
THAT STAY OUT THE REFEREE HAS 
GIVEN A GOAL KICK EVEN CASEY 
KELLER ISN'T SURE WHAT HAPPENED 
HERE HE WONDERED IF IT WAS A FREE 
KICK OR A GOAL KICK ARE BIRMINGHAM 
APPEALING FOR A CORNER 
WHAT A HEART STOPPING MOMENT FOR 
THE FULHAM SUPPORTERS BECAUSE 
JAIDI'S HEADER FROM ONE ANGLE 
LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING ON 
NEVLAND IS AWAY CAN HE SETTLE FOR 
FULHAM ERIK NEVLAND HAS SCORED 
IT'S TWO TO ZERO AND FULHAM SMELL SURVIVAL 
IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
BANKRUPT LOOK DOWN AND OUT THIS 
HAPPENED SO QUICKLY AFTER AN 
INCIDENT AT THE OTHER END L. DON'T 
THINK JAIDI HAD HIS SIGHTS ON AT 
ALL NEVLAND RAN ON AND SLOTTED 
THAT PAST MAIK TAYLOR FULHAM HAVE A TWO TO ZERO LEAD I HAVE TO 
SAY ON THEIR SECOND HALF 
PERFORMANCE BIRMINGHAM DON'T 
REALLY DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS IT'S BEEN WON BACK DAVID HEALY 
HERE PLAY IT TO HIS LEFT SIMON 
DAVIES BACK TO HEALY MAIK TAYLOR 
MAKES THE SAVE IT'S FORTY NINE MINUTES ON 
THE CLOCK SURELY CHRIS FOY WILL BE 
BLOWING ANY SECOND HERE 
FULHAM WITH THE TWO TO ZERO LEAD REAL HOPE 
REAL HOPE FOR FULHAM 
THEY WILL GO TO PORTSMOUTH ON THE 
LAST DAY OF THE SEASON PRESUMABLY 
WITH THEIR SURVIVAL PROSPECTS STILL 
INTACT INTACT WHAT A DAY WHAT A DAY FOR THE 
COTTAGERS AND THEIR FANS WEREN'T 
BIRMINGHAM POOR IT'S FULHAM TWO 
BIRMINGHAM CITY ZERO 
WE DID IT SOME STYLE IN FRONT OF 
OUR OWN CROWD THAT IS VERY VERY 
ENCOURAGING WE ARE GETTING SUCH A 
GREAT RECEPTION FROM THE CROWD WHO 
HAVE BEEN MAGNIFICENT ALL SEASON 
BUT YOU KNOW THEY WERE ASSUMING WE 
DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER PROBLEMS 
THAT ISN'T THE CASE WE DO THE THE PLAYERS WERE GETTING NERVOUS THEY 
DIDN'T GET THE FINISHING TOUCHES L. 
THINK WE HAD A DUMB OF DECENT 
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FIRST HALF WE 
WERE NOT ABLE TO CAPITALISE 
A GREAT FREE KICK A GREAT ONE FOR 
JIMMY IT GOES OVER THREE OR FOUR 
HEADS YOU COULD THINK HE COULD 
HAVE IT YOU COULD KEEP 
CONCENTRATING IT CAME THROUGH YOU YOU HAVE A SMILE ON YOUR FACE 
ABSOLUTELY IT'S A GREAT FEELING TO 
SCORE IN A GAME LIKE THIS ONE OF 
THE BIGGEST I'VE EVER BEEN IN IT'S 
A GREAT FEELING 
HOW BIG IS A 
CHALLENGE IS IT FOR YOU NOW 
IT'S A 
CHALLENGE AND A OPPORTUNITY DO I 
SEE IT AS A THREAT NO I SEE IT AS 
A OPPORTUNITY 
FULHAM HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES A 
GENUINE CHANCE OF SURVIVAL THEY THEY HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES A GREAT 
CHANCE NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
THAT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THEY 
PLAYED O. K. TODAY THEY DIDN'T HAVE 
TO PLAY THAT WELL TO BE HONEST 
BECAUSE BIRMINGHAM WERE SO POOR 
BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE TEAM THAT 
WAS GOING TO WIN THAT GAME 
DEFENSIVELY BIRMINGHAM WERE POOR 
GOING FORWARD THEY DIDN'T HAVE 
ANYTHING THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY 
EFFORTS ON TARGET WHATSOEVER THIS 
IS WHAT I CAN PULL OUT OF WHAT THEY 
DID HAVE FORSELL SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A TOUCH 
THERE HE SHOULD HAVE PUT IT IN NO 
GREAT MOVEMENT HERE THEY LEAVE 
MCFADDEN HE SHOULD HAVE HIT THE 
TARGET ZARATE AND THIS SUMS THEM 
UP JUST SLOPPY NOTHING THERE 
CARELESS AND CLUMSY IF THEY WERE 
STILL THERE NOW BIRMINGHAM THEY 
STILL WOULDN'T HAVE SCORED CREDIT CREDIT TO BIRMINGHAM FULHAM THEY HAVE 
TURNED THEIR SEASON AROUND YOU YOU HAVE GOT TO GIVE THEM CREDIT THEY 
WERE DANGEROUS FROM SET PIECES 
BIRMINGHAM COULD NOT HANDLE IT 
THEY COULD HAVE SCORED MORE THAN 
THEY DID WHAT WE HAVE GOT HERE 
THIS SHADED AREA IS WHERE THE 
PLAYERS WANT TO RUN INTO FOR THE 
DECOY FOR SIMON DAVIES TO RUN INTO 
THIS SPACE HERE AND IT WORKS A 
TREAT FOR FULHAM AND IT'S A 
FANTASTIC SAVE FROM MAIK TAYLOR 
ANOTHER FREE KICK IN FROM JIMMY 
BULLARD INTO MCBRIDE BUT IF YOU 
SAY WHO IS FULHAM'S MAIN THREAT 
SHALL WE GET TIGHT TO HIM YES 
BUT THEY DID NOT DO THAT THIS TIME 
QUEUDRUE I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS 
DOING NEVLAND ON A PLATE GOOD 
FINISH A GREAT DAY FOR FULHAM 
WHAT A CHANCE THEY HAVE GIVEN 
THEMSELVES 
WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHERE THEMSELVES THEY WERE WHEN ROY HODGSON TOOK 
OVER WHAT A JOB HE HAS DONE 
T. R. M. 
THAT VICTORY FOR FULHAM 
MEANT THAT READING NEEDED THREE 
POINTS POINTS WHAT JOB HE HAS DONE UNBELIEVABLE READING ARE UNCHANGED AS THEY LOOK 
FOR THEIR FIRST GOAL IN SIX MATCHES 
TOTTENHAM ARE WITHOUT THE INJURED 
BERBATOV DARREN BENT REPLACES HIM 
WHILE TOM HUDDLESTONE ALSO STARTS 
INSTEAD OF AARON LENNON MALBRANQUE WITH THE CROSS BENT HE 
GOT UP WELL INGIMARSSON THE 
READING CAPTAIN STAYED WITH HIM 
IS THAT THE PLAN TO GET OUT OF 
JAIL THE CUNNING PLAN FOR STEVE 
COPPELL'S TEAM GOOD SAVE BY MARCUS HAHNEMANN HAHNEMANN KEPT HIS ONE HUNDREDTH CLEAN 
SHEET IN A READING SHIRT COUPLE OF GAMES AGO KEANE A GREAT CHANCE AND IT HAS 
BEEN TAKEN YET AGAIN ROBBIE KEANE 
SCORES AGAINST READING AND 
READING'S PLIGHT HAS JUST GOT A 
LITTLE BIT WORSE AND THEIR 
POSITION JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE 
DIFFICULT HOWARD WEBB PLAYS THE 
ADVANTAGE AND IT DID TURN INTO AN 
ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE PLAYER WHO 
WAS FOULED WAS THE ONE WHO FINISHED 
OFF THE MOVE GOAL NUMBER TWENTY THREE FOR 
THE SEASON FOR HIM THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME LEFT FOR 
READING TO FIND FORM THIS SEASON 
AND THEY KNOW IT THE WORRY FOR READING IS THAT 
TOTTENHAM HAVE GOT THE TALENT TO 
SCORE AT LEAST COUPLE MORE HERE TODAY DOWN GOES MALBRANQUE WHAT A SPOT TO WIN A FREE KICK AS WELL IT WAS A SOFT FREE KICK AS 
MALBRANQUE TRIED TO CUT INSIDE THE 
LEG WAS LEFT HANGING OUT THERE BY 
BIKEY AND A GOOD SAVE FROM HAHNEMANN 
JUST WHAT READING REQUIRED A GOOD 
FREE KICK FROM ROBBIE KEANE HE 
NEARLY HAD TWO GOALS IN SIX MINUTES 
THERE READING JUST CAN'T GET THE 
BALL AT THE MOMENT IT'S ALL TOTTENHAM IT'S BRILLIANT PLAY OFFSIDE THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL WALKING THE BALL INTO THE BACK OF THE NET BUT THE OFF SIDE FLAG WAS UP AS THE BALL IS PLAYED FORWARD I AM 
NOT SURE HE IS OFF SIDE THERE 
THINK TOTTENHAM HAVE BEEN DENIED AN 
EXCELLENT GOAL FLAG STAYS DOWN MALBRANQUE SO 
CLOSE TO A SECOND GOAL FOR 
TOTTENHAM AS THE BALL IS PLAYED 
FORWARD KEANE IS ONSIDE AND 
MALBRANQUE MIGHTILY CLOSE TO THAT 
SECOND GOAL THE CROSS CAME IN FROM KEVIN DOYLE 
CERNY WAS UNDER PRESSURE FROM 
KITSON BENT GREAT BLOCK BY SHOREY NOT MUCH ROOM TO WORK IN 
SURROUNDED BY PLAYERS BRILLIANT 
IMPROVISATION AND GREAT TACKLE BY SHOREY TO THINK TWELVE MONTHS AGO THOSE SAME 
FANS WERE CONTEMPLATING THE 
POSSIBILITY OF UEFA CUP FOOTBALL LEROY LITA A COMFORTABLE SAVE FOR CERNY THE CHANCE NOW FOR BIKEY IT CAME OFF ZOKORA'S HEAD FOR A CORNER IT'S ARE BETTER SPELL FOR STEVE 
COPPELL'S TEAM IN THE LAST FIVE 
MINUTES A BETTER SPELL MATEJOVSKY THAT IS THE CLOSEST 
READING HAVE COME MATEJOVSKY WITH 
THE SHOT NOT FAR WIDE NOW KITS 
AND KITSON BENT AND THAT WAS SUCH A LUCKY BREAK FOR READING SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES REMAINING HERE APPEALS FOR HANDBALL HOWARD WEBB SAYS NO TIME IS STARTING TO RUN A BIT SHORT 
NOW WE'RE HEADING FOR THE LAST 
FIVE MINUTES WHAT AN IMPORTANT 
FIVE MINUTES IN READING'S SEASON 
DAVE KITSON GREAT SAVE DAVE 
KITSON SO CLOSE TO AN EQUALISER 
CERNY GETTING DOWN LOW AND QUICKLY 
GOOD SAVE PLENTY OF GOALS IN READING'S 
MATCHES THIS SEASON THE PROBLEM IS 
THEY HAVE ALL BEEN AT THE WRONG END ROSENIOR AND IT'S CLAWED AWAY BY 
CERNY TWICE IN TWO MINUTES 
BRILLIANT GOALKEEPING BY CERNY ROSENIOR SO CLOSE TO HIS FIRST 
GOAL FOR READING STEVE COPPELL 
KNOWS IT IS GOING TO GO TO THE WIRE 
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING NOT QUITE 
WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND 
IT IS A 
QUESTION OF WHO IMPOSES THEIR STYLE 
ON HER THEY HAVE BETTER QUALITY 
PLAYERS THEY ARE MORE COMFORTABLE 
IN POSSESSION WE WERE GIVING IT 
AWAY QUICKLY CHEAPLY KEANE WAS 
DROPPING INTO HOLES HE WAS 
DIFFICULT TO GET HOLD OF IF 
ANYTHING YOU HAVE GOT TO SAY THEY 
HAVE MASSIVELY UNDER ACHIEVED THIS 
SEASON 
HOW FRUSTRATING IS IT FOR SEASON YOU ON THE BENCH WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH 
A NARROW LEAD 
YEAH IT'S DIFFICULT 
IT'S TRUE YOU WANT TO BE CALM TO 
RELAX A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S 
IMPOSSIBLE WHEN IT'S ONE TO ZERO 
IF YOU 
DON'T WIN GAMES THEN YOU'RE GOING 
TO BE IN TROUBLE AND WE JUST 
HAVEN'T WON ENOUGH GAMES WE 
HAVEN'T SCORED ENOUGH BUT WHAT'S 
THE POINT IN GOING OVER AND OVER 
WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE WE HAVE NOW 
GOT EIGHT DAYS TO GET OURSELVES 
READY FOR ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST GAME 
IN THE CLUB'S HISTORY WE ENJOY 
PLAYING IN THE PREMIERSHIP AND WE 
WANT TO STAY HERE WE CAN ONLY 
CONCENTRATE ON WHAT WE CAN DO 
READING'S SLIDE INTO THE BOTTOM 
THREE AND THEY HAVE GOT TO FIND A 
GOAL FROM SOMEWHERE HE TRIED 
SOMETHING TODAY IT CLEARLY DIDN'T 
WORK 
THEY HAVE NOT SCORED IN SIX WORK LEAGUE GAMES SO LIKE YOU SAY HE 
HAS TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
THEY PLAYED TODAY WITH DOYLE AND 
LITA AND DAVE KITSON BUT SOMETIMES 
THEY HAD NOTHING IN THE MIDDLE 
JUST FIVE ATTACKERS AND FIVE 
DEFENDERS IF YOU GIVE QUALITY 
PLAYERS TIME AND SPACE THEY WILL 
DESTROY YOU THE NUMBER OF TIMES 
READING ATTACKED AND IT LOOKED LIKE 
TOTTENHAM WERE GOING TO SCORE IT 
WAS SIMILAR TO A SCHOOLBOY GAME 
EVERYBODY WAS GETTING SUCKED 
TOWARDS THE BALL HERE ROBBIE KEANE DOES INCREDIBLY 
WELL HE GETS HACKED DOWN BUT YOU 
LOOK AT THE FIVE READING PLAYERS 
THERE ON THE FAR SIDE COMPLETELY 
OUT OF THE PICTURE NOW THEY ARE 
ALL CHASING THE BALL AND THEN 
YOU'VE GOT TO QUESTION THE 
DEFENSIVE ATTRIBUTES HERE THAT'S 
TERRIBLE BUT A GREAT GOAL FROM 
ROBBIE KEANE IN ATTACK THIS IS 
WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT A LACK OF 
MIDFIELD TEN SECONDS AFTER THIS 
WHERE IS THE MIDFIELD O'HARA HAS 
RUN AND RUN ABSOLUTELY FREE 
DARREN BENT AGAIN HERE WHAT SORT 
OF DEFENSIVE SYSTEM IS THIS KEANE 
GETS IN THERE HE HAS SO MUCH TIME 
AND SPACE MALBRANQUE SHOULD HAVE 
SCORED THERE THE GAME SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN FINISHED HERE PLAYERS ARE 
GETTING SUCKED INTO THE BALL JENAS 
HAS GOT SO MUCH TIME THERE IS NO 
FIVE OF THEM FIVE OF 
THEM IN A LINE AND THIS SHOULD END 
UP IN THE BACK OF THE NET HE HAS GOT BIG PROBLEMS BECAUSE 
LIKE YOU SAY THERE IN THE BOTTOM 
THREE THEY NEED TO WIN THEY NEED 
TO GET GOALS FROM SOMEWHERE BUT 
YOU HAVE GOT TO DEFEND AS WELL 
IT'S GETTING THAT BALANCE RIGHT HE 
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET IT 
RIGHT AT THE MINUTE 
THEY DO PLAY 
DERBY SO 
THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS 
BOLTON WENT INTO THE LATE KICK OFF 
KNOWING THAT A VICTORY AT HOME TO 
SUNDERLAND WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY 
SECURED BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE 
FOOTBALL FOR THEM NEXT SEASON 
SECURE BOLTON KNOW THAT VICTORY 
WILL ALL BUT MATHEMATICALLY 
GUARANTEE SAFETY KEVIN DAVIES 
RETURNS FROM A TWO MATCH BAN SUNDERLAND WHO ARE SAFE HAVE JONNY EVANS FIT AGAIN OPTIMISTIC CLAIMS FROM THE BOLTON 
FANS FOR PENALTY BUT THE REFEREE SAID NO HIT HIM HIGH ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE 
OF THE CHEST 
LOOK AT THE VIEW OF MARTIN ATKINSON 
VERY WELL POSITIONED A TOUCH OF 
THE SHOULDER ABOUT IT BUT NO 
PENALTY 
SHARE OF 
POSSESSION POSSESSION TAYLOR LOOKS DIOUF 
DAVIES IS AT THE FAR POST BEST 
CHANCE OF THE GAME SO FAR 
IT COULD HAVE SEEN BOLTON ALMOST 
SAFE HE HAS THE BIG PHYSICAL MENACE 
KEVIN DAVIES BUT HE DOESN'T SCORE 
ENOUGH GOALS 
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY RICHARDSON 
FINDS MILLER 
KENWYNE JONES HAD A LITTLE CHANCE 
IN THE MIDDLE 
WENT 
FOR GOAL A DIRECT PLAYER WITH THE BALL 
KENWYNE JONES HUNGRY FOR GOALS 
PROBABLY HASN'T SCORED AS MANY 
GOALS AS HIS OVERALL PLAY HAS 
MERITED THIS SEASON JONES WAS IN THERE AND IT ZIPPED ON THROUGH THROUGH VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR 
SUNDERLAND WHEN YOU SUPPORT A GAME IN 
RELEGATION PERIL IT'S AS PLEASANT 
AS LISTENING TO FINGERNAILS SCRAPE 
DOWN A BLACK BOARD HERE'S CONFLICTEN NOLAN LOOKING 
FOR KEVIN DAVIES BEYOND HIM IS EL 
HADJI DIOUF ONE TO ZERO TO BOLTON 
WANDERERS WANDERERS FINISH OF REAL PRECISION THREE 
MINUTES BEFORE THE BREAK IT BRINGS 
A SMILE TO THE FACE OF GARY MEGSON 
IT COULD BE FORTY MILLION GOAL 
WAS THE BALL AIMED AT DAVIES OR WAS 
THE VISION ENOUGH TO SEE DIOUF 
BEAUTIFULLY PLACED A LOVELY FINISH 
KNOLLIAN WITH THE CROSS NOLAN 
WITH THE CROSS A REAL COMPOSURE 
THERE WITH EL HADJI DIOUF DIOUF'S 
SIXTH GOAL OF THE CAMPAIGN AND 
FIRST IN THE LEAGUE OF TWO HUNDRED COULD 
BE THE BIGGEST OF HIS BOLTON CAREER TAYLOR HAS CHIPPED THE FAR POST 
HOW DID THAT STAY OUT 
IT COULD HAVE WRAPPED THE GAME UP 
FOR BOLTON A MISTAKE HERE WAS NOT 
ASSERTIVE ENOUGH DIOUF ARRIVING 
BLOCKED AND AWAY BY COLLINS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SUNDERLAND 
IT COULD HAVE CHANGED THE WHOLE 
COMPLEXION OF THE RELEGATION RAT 
RACE RACE CLEVER CHIP FROM REID CLEVER 
PLAYER PLAYER HE'S ONSIDE DEFINITELY THE BOUNCE 
TOOK IT AWAY FROM HIM ONE OF THE 
BEST PASSES OF THE GAME CLEVER ILY 
SET UP FOR JONES 
TAYLOR AND WHITEHEAD TOGETHER 
IT'S A BOLTON THROW ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO WRAP IT UP 
COULDN'T QIST ENOUGH MAYBE LOST 
HIS BEARINGS THERE TAYLOR WENT TO BEND THE SHOT 
IT SKIPPED AWAY OFF THE DEFENDER 
FOR A CORNER GORDON COULDN'T KEEP 
IT IN PLAY TAYLOR'S CORNER HAS IT GONE IN 
HAS THE REFEREE GIVEN IT 
THE ASSISTANT REFEREE DID IT COULD 
WELL BE AN OWN GOAL BOLTON HAVE 
EDGED TOWARDS SAFETY 
WAS IT OVER THE LINE IT WAS 
THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP IT OUT AN OWN GOAL BY DARYL MURPHY 
EIGHT MINUTES TO GO GARY MEGSON 
SURELY EIGHT MINUTES AWAY FROM 
SAFETY SAFETY DAVIES HAS MADE SUCH A DIFFERENCE 
FOR BOLTON TODAY 
TWENTY THOUSAND BOLTON FANS CELEBRATE THEY 
KNOW BEYOND FREAKISH SERIES OF 
LAST DAY RESULTS THAT THEY ARE SAFE 
THEY HAVE WON THIS HUGE HUGE GAME 
BY TWO TO ZERO 
GARY YOU WERE BROUGHT HERE TO KEEP 
BOLTON UP IT LOOKS AS IF YOU HAVE 
DONE IT NOW 
WE ARE VERY VERY 
CLOSE TO IT L. DON'T WANT TO SOUND 
TOO NEGATIVE TODAY WAS A 
PARTICULARLY GOOD DAY BECAUSE OF 
THE STRESS THAT WAS ON EVERYBODY 
AND WE WON 
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT 
THE HAMMERING YOU GOT AT ASTON 
VILLA WHAT HAS MADE THE CHANGE ME ME COMING BACK IN ONLY MESSIN' AFTER 
THAT GAME WE SAT THERE AND THINK 
DO WE WANT TO GO DOWN FIGHTING OR 
WILL WE LET OUR SEASON PETER OUT 
AND GO DOWN LUCKILY ENOUGH AND 
THANKFULLY WE PRODUCED IN THE LAST 
FOUR OR FIVE GAMES 
THERE WAS A 
FLAG IN THE CROWD THAT SAID 
THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES ARE AWAY 
NOW 
DEFINITELY I THINK I'M NOT NOW HERE NEXT YEAR L. NEED ANOTHER 
CHALLENGE I NEED TO GET A 
CHALLENGE IN MY HEAD IT'S MY LAST 
GAME FOR BOLTON THAT'S WHY I NEED 
TO I WANT TO LEAVE BOLTON AS A 
GOOD TEAM 
WHAT DO YOU LONG TERM TO 
TAKE THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL 
KEEP IMPROVING ON THE QUALITY OF THE 
SQUAD WE HAVE MANAGE DODD THAT IN 
THE LAST FEW MONTHS IN TERMS OF 
KEEPING CERTAIN PLAYERS IN THAT 
WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE THE PLAYERS 
AT THIS CLUB SOME OF THEM HAVE HAD 
ENOUGH CHANCES SOME OF THEM ARE 
RUNNING OUT OF THEM 
WELL DONE 
BOLTON YOU WOULD NEED AN ABACUS TO 
WORK OUT A MATHEMATICAL WAY OF THEM 
NOT AVOIDING RELEGATION NOW BUT 
THEY'VE DONE WELL 
THEY'VE DONE A 
GREAT JOB A GREAT TIME TO PLAY 
SUNDERLAND AFTER THEY SECURED THEIR 
PREMIER LEAGUE STATUS LAST WEEK TO 
BE FAIR TO BOTTLE ON TO THEY 
THOROUGHLY DESERVED TO WIN THE GAME 
CAUSE THE THEM PROBLEMS BUT THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO TEAMS 
FOR ME WAS EL HADJI DIOUF HE 
PLAYED REALLY WELL SHOULD HAVE HAD 
A HAT TRICK SCORED A VERY VERY 
GOOD GOAL WHETHER YOU LOVE HIM OR 
LOATHE HIM HE HAS GOT ABILITY 
THIS IS WHAT HE CAN DO 
PROBABLY THE TOUGHEST CHANCE HE H. A 
VERY GOOD FIRST TOUCH WHAT A 
FINISH IS WE SEE IT FROM BEHIND 
THE GOAL A GOOD TOUCH GOT A BIT 
OF BEND ON IT THAT GOT THEM OFF TO 
A GREAT START HE COULD HAVE HAD A 
HAT TRICK A HEARD OPEN GOAL 
SHOULD SCORE SHOULD PUT THEM TWO 
UP A DIFFICULT HEADER HERE AGAIN 
SHOULD HIT THE TARGET BUT WE'VE 
HEARD HIM SAY THAT IS HIS LAST GAME 
HE SHOULD HAVE SCORED MORE GOALS 
FOR THEM FOR ME BUT HE HAS GOT THE 
ABILITY HE HAS PULLED THEM OUT OF 
A HOLE TODAY GARY MEGSON DESERVES 
GREAT CREDIT 
HE HAS DONE A 
TERRIFIC JOB THERE 
HE HAS HE'S 
DONE REALLY WELL HE HAS HAD SOME 
LONG LONELY SATURDAY NIGHTS GARY 
MEGSON BUT IT'S BEEN WELL WELL 
DONE 
ROY KEANE WILL BE GOING MAD DONE BECAUSE OF THIS CORNER 
YOU PUT 
SOMEBODY ON THE LINE THAT'S WHERE 
YOU WANT THEM TO BE A GOOD BALL IN 
FROM TAYLOR FLICK ON LOOK WHERE 
ANDY REID IS IS HE ON THE LINE HE 
IS STANDING BEHIND THE LINE HE 
SHOULD BE ON THAT LINE CLEARING 
THAT BALL AWAY THERE FOR SOME 
REASON HE IS A YARD BEHIND IT HE 
HAS COME RUNNING OUT TRYING TO 
PROTEST HIS INNOCENCE SAYING THAT 
THE BALL WAS NOT OVER HE WAS A 
YARD BEHIND THE LINE 
ROY KEANE 
WILL BE GOING MAD YOU TALKED ABOUT 
GARY MEGSOME YOU CAN SEE WHERE 
THEY STOOD WHEN HE TOOK OVER THEY THEY WERE BELOW DERBY COUNTY WHEN HE 
FIRST TOOK OVER HIS JOB WAS TO 
KEEP THEM IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE HE 
HAS DONE HIS JOB 
IT WAS A 
CONTROVERSIAL APPOINTMENT BUT NOT 
ANY MORE 
HE WASN'T EVERYONE'S CUP 
OF TEA ONE OF TWO RAISED EYE BROWS 
WHEN HE TOOK OVER YOU HAVE TO GIVE 
HIM GREAT CREDIT FOR WHAT HE HAS 
DONE HE HAS TAKEN THEM UP AND DONE 
HIS JOB 
A REMINDER TO WATCH MATCH 
OF THE DAY TWO ON SUNDAY ARSENAL V. 
EVERTON AND LIVERPOOL V. MANCHESTER 
CITY CITY A TENSE DAY LIES AHEAD FOR THOSE OF 
US WITH CHAMPIONSHIP ISSUES FOLLOW 
IT ALL ON SCORE INTERACTIVE FROM 
TWO ZERO ZERO P. M. TWO HUNDRED P. M. PRESS THE RED BUTTON IF YOU DARE 
BACK TO THE ACTION TWO SIDES WHO 
WERE LOOKING NERVOUSLY OVER THEIR 
SHOULDERS AT THE BEGINNING OF PLAY 
AND TWO TEAMS WHO HAD EUROPEAN 
AMBITIONS SHORTLY WE WILL SEE 
ASTON VILLA FACE WIGAN FIRST IT'S 
MIDDLESBROUGH FACE PORTSMOUTH OUR 
MAN AT THE RIVERSIDE WAS MARTIN 
FISHER FISHER CHRIS RIGGOTT HAS BEEN RECALLED 
FROM HIS LOAN SPELL BY GARETH 
SOUTHGATE AS MIDDLESBROUGH TRY TO 
CLINCH THEIR PREMIERSHIP SURVIVAL 
TWO WEEKS FROM THE F. A. CUP FINAL 
THERE'S A WEMBLEY WORKOUT FOR MILAN 
BAROS STILL LOOKING FOR HIS FIRST 
GOAL IN A PORT MOUTH SHIRT 
THAT FLIES ACROSS THE PENALTY AREA THAT TOUCH FROM NUEMBER JOHNSON 
COULDN'T CAPITALISE ON THE REBOUND 
GARETH SOUTHGATE WHO HASN'T SEEN 
HIS SIDE WIN FOR SIX WEEKS NOW TUNCAY HAS PICKED OUT ALVEZ 
SMARTLY BLOCKED THAT EFFORT 
ALERT PLAY BY TUNCAY A GREAT 
VISION VISION ALVEZ HITTING THE TARGET ON THE 
DRIVE A GREAT CHANCE AGAIN WHAT A WASTE AGAIN AGAIN TWICE NOW THAT UEMBA HAS PICKED HIM 
OUT IF HARRY REDKNAPP IS LOOKING 
THIS AS A CHANCE TO CHECK OUT 
BAROS'S SUITABILITY HE IS FAILING 
THE TEST AT THE MOMENT A PROMISING LOOKING RUN GOING FOR THE JUGULAR ALVEZ WITH THE DRIVE 
THAT WAS A POWERFUL SUMMERING RUN 
BY THE BRAZILIAN ONE FOR THE TOP 
CORNER NOT FAR WIDE HAMMERED ACROSS THE SIX YARD BOX 
CUT OUT MIDDLESBROUGH CERTAINLY ON 
TOP AT THE MOMENT 
RIGGOTT'S THERE MIDDLESBROUGH TAKE 
THE LEAD THE MAN BROUGHT BACK FROM 
HIS LOAN SPELL WITH STOKE CITY 
CELEBRATES WITH HIS FIRST GOAL FOR 
MIDDLESBROUGH IN TWO YEARS NO 
WONDER HE IS SMILING CHRIS RIGGOTT 
MET THAT FLUSH ON THE FOREHEAD AND 
MIDDLESBROUGH TAKE THE LEAD 
ASHDOWN IS GIVEN NO CHANCE AT ALL ANOTHER 
MIDDLESBROUGH CORNER ALL THE WAY IN BY TUNCAY MIDDLESBROUGH GET THEIR SECOND GOAL 
THERE'S CLEAR DAYLIGHT BETWEEN 
THEMSELVES AND PORTSMOUTH 
MIDDLESBROUGH EDGE CLOSER TO THE 
THREE POINTS THAT WILL ENSURE THEIR 
PREMIER LEAGUE SURVIVAL IF IT WAS 
EVER REALLY IN ANY DOUBT JOHNSON 
LOST TUNCAY FROM INSIDE THE SIX 
YARD WORKS THE TURK COULDN'T MISS 
MIDDLESBROUGH ON COURSE FOR THEIR 
BEST VICTORY SINCE SEPTEMBER BEST CHANCE FOR PORTSMOUTH SINCE 
BAROS MISSED IN THE BOX 
MARK SCHWARTZ GOT IT WRONG IT'S 
ONE OF THOSE DAYS FOR PORTSMOUTH 
TUNCAY HERE'S ROCKEN BACK A GOOD 
STOP BY ASHDOWN DOWNING KNOWS THAT 
WAS A BAD BAD MISS THE WHOLE GOAL 
TO AIM FOR AND DOWNING STRIKES IT 
STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GOALKEEPER EVERYBODY HAS BEEN TELLING US FOR 
WEEKS THAT WE ARE SAFE BUT WHILE 
YOU'RE INVOLVED IN IT AND YOU HAVE 
NOT GOT THE POINTS THEN YOU NEVER 
GET THE CHANCE TO SWITCH OFF SO 
THIS WAS A MASSIVELY IMPORTANT 
RESULT FOR US NOT THE BEST OF 
GAMES BUT WE DID ENOUGH TO WIN IT 
TWO OR THREE GOOD OPPORTUNITIES 
COULD NOT STICK ONE AWAY AND THEN 
THEY SCORED JUST BEFORE HALF TIME 
FROM A SET PLAY WHERE WE HAVE NOT 
MARKED WE TALKED ABOUT IT AT HALF 
TIME WE SAID WHAT IS THE POINT 
IN GIVING YOU MARKINGS WHEN YOU 
CANNOT MARK PEOPLE AND THEN 
EXACTLY THE SAME THING AGAIN SO IT 
WAS DISAPPOINTING 
THE PLAYERS HAVE 
BEEN THROUGH A HELLUVA LOT THIS 
SEASON WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN TEAMS 
START TO MAKE THAT CAP UP IN RECENT 
WEEKS YOU START TO WORRY ABOUT 
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN THAT CAP WE 
HAVE LEARNED ENORMOUS LESSONS THIS 
YEAR AS A GROUP THAT GAP L. L. HAVE 
SAID ALL ALONG THAT I THOUGHT WE 
HAD JUST ENOUGH TO STAY IN AND WE 
HAVE DONE SO IT IS A VILLA PARK FAREWELL FOR 
OLOF MELLBERG HIS FINAL HOME MATCH 
BEFORE MOVING TO JUVENTUS BUT IS 
IT THE LAST HOME APPEARANCE FOR 
GARETH BARRY NO DOUBTING THE 
STRENGTH OF THE VILLA FANS' 
FEELINGS WIGAN SO CLOSE TO SECURING THEIR 
PREMIER LEAGUE STATUS FOR A FOURTH 
SEASON VILLA CAN BUILD HERE THERE 
IS A REAL ROAR OF EXPECTATION FROM 
THE HOME SUPPORTERS THAT'S A FINAL WARNING FROM THE 
REFEREE FOR THE BIG DEFENDER 
SHINER KNIGHT SCHARNER IT WAS 
ZAT KNIGHT WITH THE HEADER THE 
TALL DEFENDER GETTING UP CHRIS 
KIRKLAND WITH THE SAVE I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT PASS WAS 
ABOUT IT'S A CORNER KICK WHAT ON 
EARTH WAS THAT BALL BACK TOWARDS 
HIS OWN GOAL FROM JASON KOUMAS ALL 
ABOUT THAT IS THE QUESTION STEVE 
BRUCE IS POSING AS WELL JUST OVER BY AGBONLAHOR JASON 
KOUMAS IS THE MOST RELIEVED MAN IN 
VILLA PARK AGBONLAHOR'S HEADER 
JUST PUSHED OVER THE BAR BY CHRIS 
KIRKLAND BARRY KIRKLAND WAS UNDER SOME 
PRESSURE THERE IT LOOKED TO BE 
REGULATION CATCH FOR CHRIS KIRKLAND 
AT FIRST BUT THEN THE WIGAN 
GOALKEEPER REALISED THAT IT WASN'T A NICE LITTLE TOUCH FROM BENT 
VALENCIA IT TAKES DEFLECTION 
AND IT'S IN ANTONIO VALENCIA PUTS 
WIGAN IN FRONT WE ARE STAYING UP 
UP SAYS THE BANNER AND 
VALENCIA'S GOAL MAY ENSURE THAT 
THAT IS THE CASE IT TAKES A HUGE DEFLECTION OFF 
WILFRED BOUMA THE BALL BALLOONING 
UP IN THE AIR OF THE VILLA DEFENDER 
OFF HOW WILL MARTIN O'NEIL'S SIDE 
REACT TO GOING GOAL DOWN OFF LOVELY BALL FROM PATRIK BERGER 
GARETH BARRY THAT WAS ON HIS WRONG 
FOOT AND ONLY JUST WIDE GARETH 
BARRY HITTING IT RIGHT FOOTED IT 
JUST STRIKES THE OUTSIDE OF THE NET 
THERE WERE MANY AMONGST THE HOME 
SUPPORT WHO THOUGHT THAT HAD GONE 
IN VALENCIA HE HAS GOT HIS SECOND 
WHAT AN AFTERNOON FOR WIGAN AND 
WHAT AN AFTERNOON FOR VALENCIA 
THEY SURELY CAME HERE MORE IN HOPE 
THAN IN EXPECTATION BUT TWO GOALS 
FROM THE ECUADOR INTERNATIONAL AND 
WIGAN LEAD UEFA CUP CHASING ASTON 
VILLA BY TWO TO ZERO EXCELLENT FINISH AGBONLAHOR WHAT A SAVE FROM 
KIRKLAND IT WAS GOING TO LOOP IN 
UNTIL KIRKLAND'S INTERVENTION A HUGELY IMPORTANT WIN FOR STEVE 
BRUCE AND WIGAN ATHLETIC IT 
GUARANTEES THEIR PLACE IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE NEXT SEASON THREE 
POINTS FROM VILLA PARK IT TAKES 
THEM ON TO FORTY FOR THE SEASON AND 
THAT HIS SAFETY 
IT IS PROBABLY AS GOOD AS I HAVE 
EVER DONE IN MANAGEMENT ONE HAVE NOT 
DONE THAT MUCH TO BE PERFECTLY 
HONEST BUT IN TERMS OF WHERE WE 
WERE GOING INTO THE BLACKBURN GAME 
MID DECEMBER ON NINE POINTS TO 
GET FORTY THIRTY ONE POINTS SINCE THE TURN OF 
THE YEAR IT'S FANTASTIC FOR THE 
PLAYERS AND I AM DELIGHTED THAT WE 
HAVE MANAGED TO DO IT 
IT WOULD BE 
HARD TO EXPLAIN REALLY HOW WE SAW 
WERE SO FLAT FOR SO LONG HOW WE 
WERE SO FLAT WE HAD AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO PUT PRESSURE ON 
EVERTON 
HOW EMOTIONAL WAS IT FOR EVERTON YOU TODAY 
YEAH IT WAS VERY IT 
WAS VERY THE FANS WERE SINGING 
THROUGHOUT THE GAME BEFORE THE 
GAME AND AFTER THE GAME L. SAW MY 
NAME ALL ROUND THE PARK THE FANS 
HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED US AND ME 
AND I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THAT 
HE HAS BEEN GOOD SERVANT TO THE 
CLUB VILLA LOOKED LIKE MISSING OUT 
ON THE UEFA CUP 
WE SAW HOW 
FRUSTRATED MARTIN O'NEIL WAS 
PARTICULARLY AFTER WORKING SO HARD 
LAST WEEK AT EVERTON TO COME AWAY 
WITH THE POINT HE WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
PUT A BIT OF PRESSURE ON BUT IT 
WASN'T TO BE 
BUT WIGAN AND BORO 
ARE SAFE LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE 
STATE OF THINGS AT THE BOTTOM OF 
THE BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE 
FULHAM ARE THE TEAM IN 
FORM WHO WOULD YOU RATHER BE 
SUPPOSE YOU WOULD WANT TO BE FOR 
THEM IT IS IN THEIR HANDS IF THEY 
GO TO PORTSMOUTH AND WIN 
PORTSMOUTH WITH ONE 
EYE ON THE CUP FINAL YOU WOULD 
FANCY FULHAM TO GO THERE AND GET 
SOMETHING RED INK AT DERBY 
READING CAN'T SCORE WEDDING I I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE ONE OF 
THOSE TENSE LAST DAYS READING 
ON MONDAY IT IS THE WOMEN'S F. A. CUP 
FINAL 
TIME NOW FOR THE APRIL GOAL OF THE 
MONTH COMPETITION PICK YOUR 
FAVOURITE 
A LUCKY BREAK THIS TIME FOR THE 
BRAZILIAN HIT MAN HE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR THE BIGGEST STAGE CARDIFF LEAD LEDLEY IS THE SCORER 
THE A LOVELY PIECE OF 
SKILL HE KEPT HIS EYE ON THE BALL 
AWAY AWAY BEAUTIFUL A LOVELY 
PIECE OF SKILL IT REALLY IS A MISERABLE AFTERNOON FOR THE DERBY COUNTY GOALKEEPER REID GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND A SUPER STRIKE FROM THE CAPTAIN IT WAS A LOVELY BALL THROUGH AND WHAT AN EXCELLENT FINISH AS WELL HE HAS GONE FOR PLACEMENT WHAT A 
GOAL WHAT A BRILLIANT BRILLIANT 
GOAL RADHI JAIDI HAS GONE AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE GOALKEEPER LARSSON SCORES BEAUTIFULLY TAKEN 
SIMPLY SELECT WHICH GOAL YOU THINK 
ALAN AND ALLEN HAVE CHOSEN AND 
THEN LET US KNOW YOUR CHOICE 
ALAN 
I HAVE JUST GOT THE BREATH LEFT TO 
TALK ABOUT OUR FINAL GAME WHICH 
SEES BLACKBURN COMFORTABLY IN THE 
TOP HALF OF THE TABLE ENTERTAINING 
A DERBY SIDE WHO ARE COMFORTABLY AT 
THE BOTTOM IF DERBY LOSE THEY ARE THE WORST 
TEAM EVER IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
AFTER CONCEDING EIGHTY TWO GOALS THEY NOW 
FACE ROQUE SANTA CRUZ WHO HAS 
SCORED SIX IN SEVEN FOR BLACKBURN 
AND IS THE FANS' PLAYER OF THE YEAR MILES RADISSON THE TEENAGER IS 
MAKING AN APPEARANCE AS A REWARD 
FOR HIS GOOD FORM IN THE RESERVES 
ADDISON THE BRAD FRIEDEL WAS PUT UNDER 
PRESSURE BY THE BACK PASS FROM 
STEVEN REID IT WAS A GOOD CLEARING HEADER BY THE YOUNGSTER THE CONFIDENT CATCH BY ROY CARROLL 
AND QUICK DISTRIBUTION KENNY 
MILLER 
HE SCORES THAT'S A 
TERRIFIC BUT A FOOTBALL IT WAS A 
HUGE KICK DOWNFIELD BY ROY CARROLL 
AND HE CAME FROM RIGHT ON THE 
HALFWAY LINE KENNY MILLER THE 
APPEALS FOR OFFSIDE WERE FUTILE HE 
SCAMPERS AWAY AS THE DEFENDERS 
DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN THE SHARP BIT OF PLAY BY THE 
SCOTTISH INTERNATIONAL A SHARP 
BIT OF PLAY BENTLEY HAS CHIPPED 
THAT UP VERY CLEVERLY WOULD IT BE INAPPROPRIATE TO SAY THAT WAS ALMOST A DAVID BECKHAM BIT OF SKILL IT FINDS ITSELF SOMEWHERE TO DARN 
MOORE HERE'S ROBERT EARN SHAW IT 
WAS BLOCKED BY STEPHEN WARN OCTOBER 
OTHERWISE DERBY MIGHT HAVE LED TWO TO ZERO 
AT HALF TIME SANTA CRUZ SLAM 
WHAT A BLOW FOR DERBY COUNTY THEY 
COULDN'T SEE IT THROUGH TO HALF 
TIME IT'S SANTA CRUZ AGAIN HIS 
TWENTY SECOND GOAL OF THE SEASON DARREN MOORE'S HEADER DOWN HERE'S 
JASON ROBERTS I'M TEMPTED TO SAY 
WHAT A PITY IT WAS TODD'S 
CLEARANCE THAT CAME OFF JASON 
ROBERTS FOUND HIMSELF WITH TIME AND 
SPACE THE INVITATION WAS TOO GOOD 
TO TURN DOWN SUDDENLY FROM 
TRAILING TWO TO ZERO THEY ARE LEADING TWO TO ONE 
DERBY WOULD HAVE TO PLAY FOR THREE 
AND A HALF SEASONS TO GET FORTY POINTS 
ROBERTS GOES FOR AN OVERHEAD AND 
ROY CARROLL SCRAMBLING TO PREVENT 
WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DELICIOUS 
GOAL HE'S SUCH A PHYSICAL PRESENCE 
JASON ROBERTS 
THERE'S NO OFFSIDE HERE'S JASON 
ROBERTS THIS SURELY WILL WRAP IT 
UP HE APPLAUDS THE PASS HE SHOULD 
HAVE SCORED 
ONE ON ONE WITH ROY CARROLL 
SANTA CRUZ IS THERE HE'S TANGLED 
UP IN THE BACK OF THE NET 
THAT MAKES IT TWENTY THREE GOALS FOR THE 
SEASON SEASON IT TOOK ROY CARROLL OUT OF THE 
EQUATION BLACKBURN THEY'VE BOSSED 
THE SECOND HALF 
ALTHOUGH WE GAVE THEM THE OPENING 
GOAL IN FAIRNESS THROUGH BAD PLAY 
FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW YOU HAVE TO 
SAY THAT THEY DESERVED IT ON THE 
FIRST HALF PERFORMANCE WE WERE 
ABLE TO GET GOAL JUST BEFORE 
HALF TIME WHICH PROBABLY WAS KIND 
TO US AND LITTLE BIT UNFAIR ON 
DERBY IN THE SECOND HALF WE CAME 
OUT WITH DRIVE AND PURPOSE AS A 
CONSEQUENCE WE SAW THE GAME OUT 
WE'VE BEEN EXPOSED IN THIS LEAGUE 
YOU KNOW DEFENSIVELY WE MAKE A 
MISTAKE INVARIABLY IT COST US A 
GOAL IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP YOU MAKE 
THOSE MISTAKES YOU MIGHT CONCEDE 
THERE IS ALMOST NO BONES ABOUT IT 
AT THE START OF THE SEASON ARSENAL 
SET OUT TO RAISE A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR 
TREEHOUSE THE NATIONAL CHARITY FOR 
EDUCATING AUTISTIC CHILDREN AS 
MARK BRIGHT REPORTS THEY'RE 
BOWLING ALONG NICELY TOWARDS THEIR 
TAR GET ARSENAL PLAYERS DO THEIR 
BIT FOR TREEHOUSE BASED IN NORTH 
LONDON A FEW MILES FROM THE 
EMIRATES STADIUM TODAY I'M TAKING 
ON THEIR TALENTED BRAZILIAN 
MIDFIELDER DENEILSON 
I HOPE HE'S NOT VERY GOOD 
TREEHOUSE IS NOT JUST A COOL AND A 
BUILDING IN WHICH THINGS TAKE PLACE 
OUR TEACHERS AND OUR PUPILS ALL OF 
THE TIME WANT TO MOVE OUT INTO THE 
COMMUNITY AND DAYS LIKE TODAY ARE 
ABOUT DOING JUST THAT IS TO THE 
KIND OF THING YOU ENJOY COMING 
DOWN AND BOWLING OR IS IT ONE OF 
THOSE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO AS A 
PLAYER 
I LOVE TO DO THAT L. THINK PLAYER THERE IS NO MAN IN THE WORLD THAT 
COULD GIVE THE HAPPINESS I'M HAVING 
HERE NOW 
AUTISM PRODUCES 
DIFFICULTIES IN LEARNING IN SOCIAL 
INTERACTION AND CHILDREN CAN HAVE 
PROFOUND COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES 
WE ARE HAVING FUN TEACHING THEM TO 
WAIT HAVE TURNS REQUEST FOR 
THINGS I HAVE SEVERAL KIDS THAT 
USE COMMUNICATION DEVICES YOU NEED 
TO USE THEM IN A PUBLIC SETTING WE 
ARE EXPOSING THE PUBLIC TO WHAT 
AUTISM IS AND HOW MUCH SUPPORT THEY 
ACTUALLY NEED 
THIS IS TERRIBLE 
I'M GETTING WORSE 
HOW CLOSE ARE ARSENAL TO THEIR 
FUNDRAISING TARGET 
VERY CLOSE THE 
PLEDGE IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WE ARE ON ABOUT 
TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND WE ARE CLOSE TO THAT WE 
ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL GO 
THROUGH THAT BARRIER WE ARE HUGELY 
GRATEFUL TO ARSENAL FOR THE SUPPORT 
THEY'VE GIVEN THROUGHOUT THIS 
SEASON SEASON HOW DID YOU FIND THE REACTION OF 
THE CHILDREN 
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE DESPITE THE DISABILITY THEY SEEM 
TO BE VERY HAPPY WHAT YOU SEE IS 
THAT YOU SHARE IN THIS HAPPINESS 
WITH THEM THIS KIND OF THING FOR 
ME IS AS GOOD AS WINNING THE WORLD 
CUP CUP GREAT SCHEME AS EVER MARK BRIGHT 
MISSING THE TARGET 
BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU LET'S TAKE 
LOOK AT THE BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE 
TABLE 
EVERTON ONLY NEED A POINT TO FINISH 
FIFTH AND QUALIFY FOR THE UEFA CUP 
DERBY WILL SET THE LOWEST POINTS 
TOTAL IN PREMIER LEAGUE HISTORY 
FALLING SHORT OF THE FIFTEEN OWNED BY 
SUNDERLAND TWO SEASONS AGO TWO 
CLUBS FROM THREE WILL JOIN DERBY IN 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP BOLTON ARE SAFE 
ONE WEEK TO GO AND MANCHESTER 
UNITED ARE THREE POINTS AWAY FROM 
DEFENDING THEIR TITLE A FORMALITY 
THE WAY THIS SEASON HAS GONE I 
DOUBT IT GOODBYE
