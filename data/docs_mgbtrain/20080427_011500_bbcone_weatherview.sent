THANK YOU 
THE COURTEENERS 
SATURDAY WAS ONE OF THE WARMEST DAYS OF THE YEAR SO FAR FOR CENTRAL 
SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND 
THE FURTHER NORTH AND WEST 
THE WEATHER TURNED OUT TO BE WETTER THAN THAT 
THAT IS ONE OF THE THEMES OF SUNDAY FOR MANY PARTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
AND THE DAY WILL BE COOLER TOO 
IT'S A DRIER AND BRIGHTER PICTURE 
FOR MANY PARTS OF SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
A COOLER NIGHT IN PROSPECT FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
BECAUSE THE CLOUD IS THINNER 
THE SKIES BEING THAT MUCH CLEARER THE HEAT WILL RADIATE AWAY 
FURTHER SOUTH UNDER THE BLANKET OF CLOUD 
IT WILL BE A MILD NIGHT AND QUITE A WET ONE ON THIS DIAGONAL 
ALL THE WAY FROM THE SOUTHWEST RIGHT UP TO THE NORTHEAST OF ENGLAND 
A MILD START BUT QUITE A WET ONE WITH SOME LOW LEVEL CLOUD 
ACROSS THE MOORS AND THE TORS OF THE SOUTHWEST 
AND QUITE WET ACROSS THE BODY OF WALES AS YOU DRIFT NORTHWEST 
TO ANGLESEY PERHAPS IT MIGHT STAY DRY BUT PRETTY GREY 
BRIGHTER PROSPECTS TOWARDS NORTHERN IRELAND AND ACROSS MUCH OF SCOTLAND 
BUT A DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERATURES 
NO DOUBLE FIGURE TEMPERATURES HERE AT THIS STAGE OF THE DAY 
QUITE CHILLY ACROSS THE CENTRAL BELT AND ABERDEEN AS WELL 
TOWARDS THE BORDER THE CLOUD THICKENS AND EVENTUALLY IS THICK ENOUGH 
TO PRODUCE RAIN ACROSS LANCASHIRE YORKSHIRE LINCOLNSHIRE 
THE MIDLANDS AS WE MOVE TOWARDS THE SOUTHEAST THROUGH ESSEX SUFFOLK 
AND EASTERN KENT IT COULD EVEN BE A SUNNY START TO THE DAY HERE 
MAKE THE MOST OF THAT BECAUSE THAT SUNSHINE WILL BE IN SHORT SUPPLY 
AS THIS AREA OF CLOUD AND RAIN TRICKLES ITS WAY FURTHER TOWARDS 
THE EAST AND DRIVES ITS WAY FURTHER TOWARDS THE NORTH 
AS WE MOVE TOWARDS THE MID AFTERNOON 
ALL OF THAT MEANS IT'LL STAY PRETTY WET ACROSS THE MIDLANDS 
AND ACROSS MUCH OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
THE CLOUD THICKENING UP ALL THE WHILE AS THE CLOUD AND RAIN WORKS ITS WAY 
UP TOWARDS THE BORDERS AND WE'LL SEE SOME RAIN IN SOUTHEAST SCOTLAND 
TO FINISH OFF THE DAY THE FURTHER NORTH AND WEST YOU ARE 
THE MORE LIKELY YOU'LL STAY A BIT DRIER 
SOME SHOWERS IN NORTHERN IRELAND BUT A PLEASANT AFTERNOON 
IF YOU MISS THOSE WITH A HIGH OF FOURTEEN DEGREES 
SIMILAR FIGURE BUT A DIFFERENT SORT OF DAY FOR THE SOUTH OF WALES 
EVENTUALLY WE'LL SEE SOMETHING DRIER GETTING IN THERE BECAUSE 
THE DRY WEATHER IS ALREADY HERE IN THE FIRST PART OF THE AFTERNOON 
ACROSS THE FAR SOUTHWEST AND ALONG THE SOUTH COAST 
IF THE SUN SHOULD POP OUT 
LATER ON IN THE AFTERNOON WE COULD SEE TEMPERATURES OF SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN DEGREES 
GOING INTO MONDAY THE LOW PRESSURE DRIVES THIS AREA OF CLOUD AND RAIN 
FURTHER TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST OF SCOTLAND 
WITH PLENTY OF SHOWERS WRAPPING IN ON ITS SOUTHERN FLANK 
AND THAT WILL BE THE SET UP FOR MONDAY 
THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CLOSE BY TO THE NORTHEAST OF SCOTLAND 
A WET DAY HERE BLUSTERY 
AND HEAVY SHOWERS TO THE SOUTH 
THAT'S THE START OF AN UNSETTLED WEEK 
FOR MANY PARTS OF THE BRITAIN 
FORGET ABOUT TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWO 
AND LOTS OF SUNSHINE 
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE WAY OF IT 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU ARE 
THERE WILL BE QUITE CHILLY SPELLS 
AND REALLY TORRENTIAL RAIN AS WELL 
WITH MAYBE THE ODD RUMBLE OF THUNDER A LOT GOING ON 
MORE DETAILS AS EVER ON THE WEBSITE GOODNIGHT 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER
