IT DOESN'T SOUND VERY JAPANESE 
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A TOTAL GUESS AT RUSSIA PLEASE 
IT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER 
THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF SHEBA WAS LOCATED IN WHICH PART OF THE WORLD 
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS OFFICIALLY A REAL PLACE 
BECAUSE THE QUEEN OF SHEBA IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE COME FROM

UZBEKISTAN I'M NOT AWARE OF IT EVER HAVING BEEN UNDER BRITISH CONTROL 
PAKISTAN I BELIEVE WAS 
BUT INDIA GOT ITS INDEPENDENCE IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN 
WOULD PAKISTAN HAVE GOT IT BEFOREHAND 
PROBABLY AFGHANISTAN 
I DON'T KNOW THIS AT ALL BUT PAKISTAN TO ME SEEMS MOST LOGICAL 
SO THAT'S THE ONE I'LL TRY 
WHICH MEANS IT PROBABLY ISN'T 
NO IT ISN'T PAKISTAN YOU MENTIONED THERE INDIAN INDEPENDENCE 
PAKISTAN GOT INDEPENDENCE AT THE SAME TIME 
IT WAS CREATED IN PARTITION SO THE ANSWER IS AFGHANISTAN 
AFGHANISTAN SO IT'S ALL SQUARE RACHEL 
TO PUT YOU INTO THE LEAD WHICH U. S. PRESIDENT 
WAS THE FIRST TO ADDRESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON TELEVISION 
I'M SURE C. J. KNOWS THE ANSWER TO THIS ONE 
I DON'T UNFORTUNATELY 
I THINK I'LL TRY THEODORE ROOSEVELT

THINKING IT BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE I HAVE HEARD THE NAME GIBSON 
I'LL GO FOR THE ONE THAT 
IS MOST PROMINENT TO ME WHICH IS MUSSOLINI 
VIOLET GIBSON ATTEMPTED TO ASSASSINATE MUSSOLINI 
IT'S RIGHT IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX 
BAD LUCK RACHEL IT MEANS C. J. WILL BE IN THE FINAL ROUND

IS THE MOST NORTHERLY CASTLE ON THE BRITISH MAINLAND 
THIS IS ONE WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE A BIT OF A POP AT URM 
I KNOW THAT THE QUEEN MOTHER ORIGINALLY CAME FROM CAITHNESS 
SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO START TO THINK ABOUT IT 
I DON'T THINK IT'S FRAMLINGHAM CASTLE 
I MAY BE PROVED WRONG 
I'M GOING TO GO FOR A POP AT CRAIGIEVAR CASTLE 
ALL RIGHT CRAIGIEVAR CASTLE 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT WITH THE CAITHNESS 
IT'S CASTLE OF MEY

WHAT SORT OF GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURE IS KANGCHENJUNGA 
WELL I'M TRYING TO THINK WHERE IT IS

IT'S A MOUNTAIN DERMOT 
LUCKY FOR YOU I'M NOT ASKING THAT IT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER DAPHNE

MIGHT A FARADAY CAGE BE USED 
WE THINK THAT IS LIGHTNING 
LIGHTNING IS THE RIGHT ANSWER EGGHEADS 
HOW DOES THAT WORK THEN 
FOR THE ROYAL INSTITUTION LECTURES CHRISTMAS TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS WHO WAS GIVING IT ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATED IT 
YOU LITERALLY STAND INSIDE A METAL CAGE 
AND SIMULATE A LIGHTNING BOLT TO HIT YOU FROM ABOVE 
THE THEORY IS THE METAL WILL TRANSFER THE ELECTRICITY 
AROUND YOU AND NOT DAMAGE THE THING INSIDE 
REALLY IT'S LIKE IF YOU GET 
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING IN A CAR THE FRAME SHOULD PROTECT YOU 
I THOUGHT THE RUBBER WHEELS PROTECTED YOU 
AND YOUR WELLIES
