KING ARTHUR LEAPED AND PUNCHED THE AIR WHOOPEE HE'S COME AT LAST 
THIS IS JACKANORY JUNIOR 
HELLO I'M KRIS 
THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW AN ORDINARY BOY NAMED ARTHUR 
BECAME KING OF ENGLAND 
IN THE DAYS OF MERRY ENGLAND WHEN MEN WORE STRETCHY TIGHTS 
THE CRAZY CASTLE CAMELOT STOOD CROWNED WITH NUTTY KNIGHTS 
THEY ALL SAT ROUND A TABLE DRESSED UP IN METAL KIT 
THEIR TABLE WAS A ROUND ONE COS A SQUARE ONE WOULDN'T FIT 
THEY WENT ON MANY ADVENTURES YES THEY TRAVELLED WIDE AND FAR 
THEY HAD TO GO BY HORSE OF COURSE AS THEY HADN'T GOT A CAR 
BUT IN THOSE DAYS SO LONG AGO IT WAS EASIER TO BE BRAVE 
THERE WERE LOADS OF TROLLS DRAGONS AND MANY MAIDS TO SAVE 
SO LET ME TAKE A GOOD OLD GULP FROM MY MAGIC CUP 
AND NOW LET'S SPIN THE TABLE TO SEE WHICH KNIGHT POPS UP 
BEFORE US STANDS KING ARTHUR OF KINGS HE WAS THE BEST 
HE KNEW NO FEAR HE LIKED HIS BEER AND WORE A METAL VEST 
I'LL TELL YOU THE WONDROUS STORY OF HOW HE CAME TO RULE 
SO JUST STAY PUT AND LISTEN IT'S CRAZY BUT IT'S COOL 
UNDER THE OLD KING UTHER EVERYTHING SEEMED ALL RIGHT 
BUT SOMEBODY POISONED HIS PORRIDGE AND EVERYONE STARTED TO FIGHT 
EVERYONE WANTED HIS CASTLE EVERYONE WANTED HIS CROWN 
BUT EVERY TIME SOMEBODY GRABBED THEM SOMEBODY ELSE KNOCKED THEM DOWN 
THE NASTIEST KNIGHTS WENT PICKING FIGHTS BOLD BARONS UNFURLED THEIR BANNERS 
EVERYONE SCRABBLED FOR WEALTH AND POWER AND THEY ALL FORGOT THEIR MANNERS 
THE COUNTRY WAS SEETHING WITH VILLAINS DOING THEIR PILLAGE AND LOOT 
THERE JUST WASN'T ANYONE LEFT IN CHARGE TO GIVE THEM A GOOD STRONG BOOT 
NOW DEEP IN THE WOODS WAS A WIZARD A MAKER OF MYSTERY 
HE COULD CHANGE HIMSELF INTO A BAT OR A BIRD AND HIDE IN THE BOUGH OF A TREE 
HE WAS TALL AND THIN AND ANCIENT WITH A BEARD AND A BRILLIANT CLOAK 
AND THE FOLK ALL CALLED HIM MERLIN THAT WEIRD OLD WIZARD BLOKE 
BUT THEY KNEW HE WAS REALLY BRAINY OF THAT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT 
SO EVERYONE HOPED THAT MERLIN WOULD SORT THIS KING THING OUT 
AND OUT FROM THE WOODS HE CAME AT LAST WEARING A SERIOUS FROWN 
HE MUTTERED A WORD CHANGED INTO A BIRD AND FLEW TO LONDON TOWN 
IN LONDON HE SHOOK OFF HIS FEATHERS AND SUMMONED ALL KNIGHTS AND LORDS 
THEY CAME FROM ALL PARTS HOPE HIGH IN THEIR HEARTS 
WITH THEIR HELMETS AND SHIELDS AND SWORDS 
THEY SCRAPPED AND THEY YAPPED AND THEY SQUABBLED LIKE A PACK OF DOGS WITH A BONE 
FOR EACH GREAT LUMP THOUGHT HIS VERY OWN RUMP WOULD COMFORTABLY FIT THE THRONE 
BUT WHEN THEY TURNED UP AT THE MEETING GOOD HEAVENS WHAT'S THIS THEY FOUND 
A SWORD STUCK INTO A BOULDER IT KIND OF APPEARED ON THE GROUND 
THE BOULDER IT STOOD ON A MARBLE BLOCK ON THE BLOCK WERE WORDS IN GOLD 
WHOEVER CAN PULL THIS SWORD OUT GETS THE JACKPOT IT'S HIS TO HOLD 
BUT MORE THAN THAT THE LUCKY OLD CHAP WHO DRAWS IT OUT BY HAND 
WHY THAT'S THE CHAP TO CHEER AND CLAP AS THE KING OF ALL THE LAND 
WELL EVERYONE WANTED TO TRY THEIR LUCK THEY QUEUED FROM FIRST TO LAST 
BUT NO ONE COULD BUDGE THAT BLADE AN INCH THE SWORD STOOD FIRMLY FAST 
MANY A KNIGHT CAME STRIDING UP TO HOICK AND HEAVE AND HUFF 
BUT EVERYONE WENT TOTTERING BACK ALL PALE AND OUT OF PUFF 
SO IN THE END THEY CRIED ENOUGH THIS IS A BARMY TEST 
LET'S PUT TOGETHER A MEETING TO SEE WHO JOUSTS THE BEST 
ONE OF THE KNIGHTS SIR ECTOR HAD BROUGHT HIS SON SIR KAY 
AND KAY'S YOUNG BROTHER ARTHUR WAS ACTING SQUIRE THAT DAY 
POOR YOUNG ARTHUR WAS ONLY A LAD AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS BRAVE AND BOLD 
HE HAD TO FOLLOW HIS BROTHER AROUND AND DO AS HE WAS TOLD 
JUST AS THEY REACHED THE MEETING KAY CRIED OUT LOUD OH LORD 
OH DEAR OH GOLLY I AM A WALLY I FORGOT ME SWORD 
SO BROTHER ARTHUR HURRIED BACK TO FETCH IT FROM THEIR TENT 
BUT THE ONLY SWORD THAT HE COULD SEE WAS BLUNT AND BADLY BENT 
HE WENT TO SEEK SOME OTHER SWORD HE HUNTED ALL AROUND 
UNTIL AT LAST HE CAME RIGHT PAST THAT BOULDER ON THE GROUND 
AND WHEN HE SAW THE TRUSTY WEAPON STICKING IN THE AIR 
HE REACHED STRAIGHT OUT AND GAVE A SHOUT I'LL BORROW THAT ONE THERE 
I WOULDN'T DREAM OF STEALING IT HE SAID IT'S JUST A LOAN 
AND WHEN HE PULLED WELL BLOW ME DOWN 
THE BLADE SLID OUT THE STONE 
SO BACK HE WENT TO THE MEETING AND HANDED IT TO KAY 
BUT WHEN HIS BROTHER SAW IT HIS COLOUR DRAINED AWAY 
CRIKEY BREATHED THE KNIGHT IN AWE WELL HERE'S A SWORD TO SWING 
THIS VERY DAY THE GREAT SIR KAY IS DESTINED TO BE KING 
UP STRODE SIR ECTOR LOOKING CROSS AND GAVE HIS SON A CLOUT 
YOU DID YOUR BEST AND FAILED THE TEST SO PUT IT BACK YOU LOUT 
IF YOU CAN PULL IT OUT YOURSELF JUST SHOW ME ONE REPEAT 
IF YOU'RE MY LORD I'LL EAT MY SWORD I'LL EVEN KISS YOUR FEET 
BACK THEY WENT TO THE BOULDER TO TRY THE TEST AGAIN 
BUT TRY AS HE MIGHT SIR KAY THE KNIGHT JUST TUGGED AND TUGGED IN VAIN 
HOW DID YOU DO IT ARTHUR HE SAID WITH AN ANGRY HISS 
ARTHUR JUST REACHED HIS HAND OUT NO SWEAT HE SAID LIKE THIS 
HE LIFTED OUT THE SHINING SWORD AND HELD IT UP ALOFT 
SIR KAY AND OLD SIR ECTOR BOTH FELT THEIR KNEES GO SOFT 
WHILE SOON THE OTHERS GATHERED ROUND FOR RUMOURS TRAVEL QUICKLY 
WHAT TAKE THIS LITTLE WIMP AS KING THEY CRIED HE'S SMALL AND SICKLY 
IT ISN'T RIGHT HE'S NOT A KNIGHT BESIDES HE'S UNDER AGE 
A LAD LIKE THAT HE'S JUST A BRAT NOT FIT TO BE A PAGE 
BUT SUDDENLY A SHADOW SPREAD AS CLOUDS BLOCKED OUT THE SUN 
AND MERLIN THE MAGICIAN'S VOICE BOOMED QUIET EVERYONE 
I TELL YOU ALL MY FORTUNE BALL IS GLOWING AND IT SHOWS 
IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THIS BOY HERE'S THE ONE THE BOULDER CHOSE 
SIR ECTOR HERE HAS REARED THE LAD TO BE A WORTHY KNIGHT 
SWEAR ON YOUR SWORDS YOU OTHER LORDS TO SERVE HIM AS IS RIGHT 
THEN ARTHUR STOOD AND CLEARED HIS THROAT HE FELT ALL FLUSHED AND SHY 
SO HE TRIED TO MAKE HIS VOICE SOUND DEEP THOUGH REALLY IT WAS HIGH 
WE'LL BUILD A SWANKY CASTLE WE'LL GIVE IT ALL WE'VE GOT 
WE'LL FILL IT FULL OF FUNNY FOLK AND CALL IT CAMELOT 
WE'LL TAKE ON TROLLS AND DRAGONS AND CHASE BIG GIANTS AWAY 
COOL CAMELOT WILL BE SO HOT AND I'M THE KING HURRAY 
AND WHEN WE'RE TIRED AND HUNGRY WE'LL MEET BACK THERE FOR FUN 
WE'LL SIZZLE PIGS DO SILLY JIGS AND I'LL BE NUMBER ONE 
SO ARTHUR GOT HIS CAMELOT SURROUNDED BY HIS KNIGHTS 
EACH MAN WAS BRAVE AND FEARLESS AND THEY ALL LOOKED GREAT IN TIGHTS 
MANY MORE ADVENTURES THESE NOBLES UNDERTOOK 
AND MEN OF RENOWN THEY WROTE THEM DOWN AND STUCK THEM IN THIS BOOK 
AH HERE'S ONE I THINK YOU'LL LIKE I'M SURE IT CANNOT FAIL 
IT TELLS HOW GREAT SIR GALAHAD SET OUT TO GET THE GRAIL 
THE GRAIL WHAT'S THAT YOU MAY WELL ASK WELL IT'S A KIND OF CUP 
AND IF YOU GET TO HOLD IT YOUR LUCK IS ON THE UP 
BUT WHEN I SAY IT'S LIKE A CUP I DON'T MEAN A PIECE OF POTTERY 
GETTING HOLD OF THE GRAIL IT'S GOLD IT'S MORE LIKE WINNING THE LOTTERY 
THIS HOLY GRAIL WAS FAR AWAY LOST TO A FOREIGN LAND 
LOCKED UP AS PRECIOUS TREASURE BY A GREEDY ROBBER BAND 
A LEGEND TOLD THAT THE THREE BEST KNIGHTS WOULD ONE DAY CROSS THE SEA 
AND BRING THE GRAIL BACK HOME TO SHOW TO FOLKS LIKE YOU OR ME 
BUT HERE'S THE HITCH IN CAMELOT THE BEST KNIGHT WASN'T THERE 
FOR AT THE GREAT ROUND TABLE THERE STOOD AN EMPTY CHAIR 
UPON THE CHAIR SOME WORDS WERE CARVED AND THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID 
IF YOU'RE NOT THE BEST DON'T TRY THE TEST SIT HERE AND YOU'LL BE DEAD 
SO THE CHAIR JUST STOOD THERE EMPTY AS NO ONE SEEMED TO FIT 
AH WELL SIGHED GOOD KING ARTHUR WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT A BIT 
WE CAN'T SEND THE BEST THREE KNIGHTS OUT THERE IF THE BEST KNIGHT'S NOT YET COME 
SENDING TWO JUST WOULDN'T DO THAT WOULD BE SIMPLY DUMB 
THEN ONE DAY BRAVE SIR LANCELOT WAS RIDING THROUGH THE WOOD 
WHEN HE SAW A GLOW OF GOLDEN LIGHT AND IT MADE HIM FEEL SO GOOD 
AND THE GLOW BECAME A VISION OF THE GRAIL SO BRIGHT AND FINE 
THEN HE SPAN AROUND AND FELL TO THE GROUND AS IF HE'D HAD TOO MUCH WINE 
THE NUNS OF A NEARBY CONVENT FOUND HIM AND PUT HIM TO BED 
THEY GAVE HIM A FUNNY POTION WHICH HELPED TO CLEAR HIS HEAD 
THEN THEY BROUGHT HIM A LAD WITH GOLDEN HAIR WHO LOOKED BOTH BRAVE AND TRUE 
AND THEY SAID WHEN YOU GO TO CAMELOT PLEASE TAKE THIS BOY WITH YOU 
HE WAS LEFT WITH US AS A BABY BUT HE'S GROWING BIG AND STRONG 
WE CAN'T KEEP A MAN IN A CONVENT THAT WOULD BE REALLY WRONG 
YES TEACH ME TO BE A KNIGHT LIKE YOU SAID THE EAGER YOUTHFUL LAD 
TEACH ME TO FIGHT AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT MY NAME IS GALAHAD 
SO LANCELOT TOOK THAT KEEN YOUNG MAN AND TAUGHT HIM THE TRICKS OF THE TRADE 
HOW TO STAY ON A HORSE AND YES OF COURSE HOW TO WIELD A BIG STRONG BLADE 
HOW TO PUT ON A HELMET THE RIGHT WAY ROUND AND FASTEN AN IRON BOOT 
HOW NOT TO FALL DOWN LIKE A CIRCUS CLOWN WHEN WEARING A TWO TON SUIT 
GALAHAD LEARNED SO QUICKLY HE COULD GALLOP BEFORE HE COULD TROT 
SOON IT WAS TIME TO INTRODUCE THE LAD TO CAMELOT 
MY FRIENDS CRIED BOLD SIR LANCELOT LOOK AT THIS LOVELY SIGHT 
SEE WHAT I'VE FOUND IN THE FOREST A BRAND NEW NOBLE KNIGHT 
GALAHAD NODDED A GREETING THEN SAT IN THE EMPTY CHAIR 
EVERYONE SHRIEKED AND POINTED BE CAREFUL DON'T SIT THERE 
WHY NOT SAID GOLDEN GALAHAD IT SEEMS TO FIT JUST FINE 
BESIDES I FEEL IT IN MY BONES THIS CHAIR IS CLEARLY MINE 
KING ARTHUR LEAPED AND PUNCHED THE AIR WHOOPEE HE'S COME AT LAST 
THIS LAD MUST BE OUR TRUE BEST KNIGHT OUR LONG LONG WAIT IS PAST 
HE GOT YOUNG GALAHAD TO KNEEL AND KNIGHTED HIM AT HIS FEET 
ARISE SIR GALAHAD HE SAID AND TAKE YOUR RIGHTFUL SEAT 
OUR COMPANY IS COMPLETE HE CRIED AT LAST OUR BEST KNIGHT'S HERE 
LET'S SEND OUT FOR A TAKEAWAY AND CAMELOT'S BEST BEER 
JUST AS THE MEAL WAS ENDING SIR LANCELOT SPOKE UP 
I SAW A VISION THE OTHER DAY OF THE MISSING GOLDEN CUP 
EVERYONE GASPED IN WONDER THE CUP THE HOLY GRAIL 
THIS MEANS IT'S TIME TO BRING IT HOME COME ON LET'S HIT THE TRAIL 
AH NO CUT IN WISE MERLIN THIS IS A SPECIAL QUEST 
IT'S MEANT FOR THREE AND THEY MUST BE TIPTOP THE VERY BEST 
GALAHAD WILL BE NUMBER ONE AT FIGHTING LANCELOT'S ACE 
NOW WHO'S GOT GOOD SURVIVAL SKILLS TO FILL THE FINAL PLACE 
EVERYONE LOOKED AT PERCIVAL THE WILD KNIGHT FROM THE WEST 
THAT'S IT SAID MERLIN NODDING THESE THREE KNIGHTS MAKE THE BEST 
SO GALAHAD AND LANCELOT AND PERCIVAL AGREED 
THAT THEY WOULD RIDE BOTH FAR AND WIDE UNTIL THEY'D DONE THE DEED 
FOR WHERE THE HOLY GRAIL WAS THEY HARDLY HAD A NOTION 
THEY ONLY KNEW IT LAY OUT THERE ACROSS THE FOAMING OCEAN 
I HAD A DREAM SAID GALAHAD THAT IT WAS SOMEWHERE HOT 
SO OFF THEY SAILED WITH SUNTAN CREAM FROM CHILLY CAMELOT 
THEY CAME TO A FAR COUNTRY WITH LOTS OF SUN AND SAND 
THEY WENT ASHORE SAYING LET'S EXPLORE THIS SEEMS A LIKELY LAND 
BUT NO ONE KNEW OF THE GOLDEN GRAIL WHEN THEY TRIED TO ASK THE WAY 
AND THE THREE KNIGHTS PLODDED STAUNCHLY ON DAY AFTER WEARY DAY 
THEY MET WITH GIANTS AND DRAGONS SERPENTS WITH MANY HEADS 
THEY GRAPPLED WITH TROLLS AND DEMONS FOUND SCORPIONS IN THEIR BEDS 
AND THE SAND GOT INTO THEIR SANDWICHES AND TICKLED BETWEEN THEIR TOES 
WHILE MIDGES BIT THEM ON THE EAR AND GOT RIGHT UP THEIR NOSE 
BUT THOUGH THEY FOUGHT WITH MANY A FOE IN BATTLES FIERCE AND BOLD 
THEY NEVER HEARD A WHISPER OF THE GRAIL THAT GLOWED SO GOLD 
TILL ONE DAY GALAHAD WOKE UP WITH BOTH BLUE EYES AGLEAM 
SURPRISE SURPRISE I'VE GOT IT GUYS I'VE SEEN IT IN A DREAM 
THE GRAIL'S IN A RUINED FORTRESS OUT IN THE DESERT SANDS 
NO ONE GOES THERE NOWADAYS EXCEPT FOR ROBBER BANDS 
SO OFF THEY WENT THAT TRUSTY TRIO ACROSS THE DESERT DUNES 
TO BLOW AWAY THEIR BOREDOM THEY WHISTLED SILLY TUNES 
TILL THERE IT STOOD WITH BROKEN WALLS AND TOWERS ALL TUMBLED DOWN 
BE CAREFUL NOW SAID LANCELOT AND GAVE A WARY FROWN 
FOR AS HE GUESSED INSIDE THE FORT WAS HIDDEN MANY A GUARD 
AND ALL OF THEM HAD CUTLASSES AND ALL OF THEM WERE HARD 
SO THOUGH OUR KNIGHTS WERE WEARY THEY BATTLED BIFF BAFF BOFF 
THEY MADE THOSE ROBBERS LEAP ABOUT AND SENT THEM HOWLING OFF 
THEY SEARCHED THE RUINED FORTRESS AND FOUND A SECRET STAIR 
THEY STOPPED TO LIGHT A CANDLE AND TIPTOED DOWN WITH CARE 
THIS COULD BE IT SAID GALAHAD THERE'S SOMETHING HERE NO DOUBT 
A CHILLY DRAUGHT CAME WAFTING THROUGH AND BLEW THEIR CANDLE OUT 
THEY SHUFFLED SLOWLY FORWARDS TOWARDS A DISTANT GLOW 
IT SHONE BOTH BRIGHT AND GOLDEN GALAHAD CRIED WOO HOO 
HE JUMPED AROUND DELIGHTED AND POINTED AT THE GLEAM 
LOOK PERCE AND LANCE I WANT TO DANCE IT'S JUST LIKE IN MY DREAM 
I KNEW WE'D GET TO DO IT I KNEW WE WOULDN'T FAIL 
IT'S STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF US THE SHINING HOLY GRAIL 
BUT LANCELOT AND PERCIVAL WERE DAZZLED BY ITS GLOW 
SIR GALAHAD GOT HOLD OF IT AND CRIED O. K. LET'S GO 
AND GO THEY DID THEY MOUNTED UP AND WENT OFF AT A TROT 
AND AFTER MANY WEEKS RETURNED TO CASTLE CAMELOT 
YOU'D THINK THEY'D WON THE FOOTBALL TO SEE FOLK JUMP AND SHOUT 
KING ARTHUR CALLED A HOLIDAY AND EVERYONE CAME OUT 
AND THEN HE THREW A SPECIAL FEAST TO CELEBRATE THE CUP 
COME ON YOUNG GALAHAD HE CRIED PLEASE HOLD THE TROPHY UP 
AND AS HE DID THE DINING HALL WAS FILLED WITH GOLDEN LIGHT 
AND NOBODY COULD LOOK AT IT EXCEPT THE TRUE BEST KNIGHT 
THEN AS THE DAZZLE FADED THEY OPENED UP THEIR EYES 
AND WOW THE GRAIL AND GALAHAD WERE HEADING FOR THE SKIES 
A MAGICAL VOICE CAME BOOMING DOWN THEY'RE MUCH TOO GOOD FOR YOU 
SIR GALAHAD WILL GUARD THE GRAIL IN HEAVEN OUT OF VIEW 
WELL NEVER MIND KING ARTHUR SHRUGGED I STILL SAY THAT WE'VE DONE IT 
BEFORE IT FLOATED UP TO HEAVEN THE CUP WAS OURS WE WON IT 
SO THERE'S THE TALE OF HOW THE GRAIL CAME BACK TO CAMELOT 
AND THIS IS ME I'M CHECKING OUT AND WINDING UP THE PLOT 
FOR NOW MY STORY'S OVER AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING BY 
SO SEE YOU SOON AGAIN I HOPE UNTIL THAT TIME BYE BYE
