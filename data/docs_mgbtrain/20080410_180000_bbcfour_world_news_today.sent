BADAWI THE 
HIGH COURTISH 
STINGING 
THE HIGH COURTISH STINGING PROBLEM ON 
TONY BLAIR 
TO EASE THE 
BURDEN ON 
OUR 
AND FAMILIES 
HAVE I DIRECTED 
THE 
DEFENSE TO REDUCE 
DEPLOYMENT LENGTHS FROM FIFTEEN MONTHS 
TO TWELVE MONTHS 
AS PRESIDENT BUSH PRAISES HIS 
TROOPS IN IRAQ WE REPORT FROM A 
TOWN WHERE THE MEMORY OF THE FALLEN 
IS NOT FORGOTTEN 
AND ROBERT MUGABE AND THE 
OPPOSITION LEADER AGREE TO ATTEND 
AN EMERGENCY SUMMIT WITH AFRICAN 
LEADERS WHAT CHANCE FOR A 
RESOLUTION AND COULD THE MISSING 
CHILD ALERT HELP THE MCCANNS FOR A 
NEW EUROPE WIDE SCHEME WELCOME WELCOME THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT UNDER TONY 
BLAIR HAS EFFECTIVELY BEEN ACCUSED 
OF CAVING INTO PRESSURE FROM SAUDI 
ARABIA AND ABANDONING AN 
INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED BRIBE 
REAND CORRUPTION THE HIGH COURT IN 
LONDON RULED THAT THEY ACTED 
ILLEGALLY BY DROPPING THE INQUIRY 
INTO THE EIGHTY DOLLAR ARMS DEALS BETWEEN B. A. E. 
SYSTEMS AND SAUDI ARABIA TWO YEARS 
AGO IT IS ALLEGED IN THE EIGHTY B. A. E. 
BRIBED SAUBY OFFICIALS TO SECURE 
THE DEAL B. A. E. SYSTEMS DENIED 
WRONGDOING WRONGDOING WE LOOK AT THE IMPLICATIONS OF 
TODAY'S DECISION 
IT WAS BRITAIN'S BIGGEST EXPORT 
DEAL IN HISTORY KNOWN AS AL 
YAMAMAH BILLIONS OF POUNDS WORTH 
OF JETS TRAINERS AND OWE EQUIPMENT 
SOLD TO SAUDI ARABIA FROM THE NINETEEN EIGHTY 
ONWARDS NOW THE HIGH COURT RULED 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT HAVE 
STOPPED A PROBE INTO WHETHER OR NOT 
THIS WAS SECURED THANKS TO BRIBERY 
THE ALLEGATIONS ARE BACK IN THE EIGHTY 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF BRIBE WERE 
PAID BY B. A. E. INTO THE POCKETS OF A 
KEY SAUDI PRINCE BOTH HE AND B. A. E. 
BE DENY WRONGDOING BUT THE SERIOUS 
FRAUD OFFICE WAS SUSPICIOUS ENOUGH 
TO LAUNCH A CRIMINAL PROBE IT WAS 
OWNING IN ON SWISS BANK ACCOUNTS 
WHEN TONY BLAIR ORDERED THE PROBE 
STOPPED QUOTING SAUDI THREATS THE 
THREATS WERE DELIVERED IN PRIVATE 
BUT THEY WERE EXPLICIT STOP THE 
PROBE OR TRADE WILL SUFFER AND WE 
WILL STOP HELPING ON COUNTER 
TERRORISM THE IMPLICATION WAS THAT 
BRITAIN COULD BE AT RISK OF ANOTHER 
SEVEN SEVENTHS ATTACK TODAY THE HIGH COURT 
JUDGES SAID IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT IF 
THEY COULD NOT INTERFERE WITH THE 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT LAST 
YEAR TONY BLAIR DEFENDED HIS 
DECISION TO STOP THE SERIOUS FRAUD 
OFFICE PROBE 
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE 
INVESTIGATIONS WOULD HAVE LED 
ANYWHERE APART FROM TO THE 
WRECKAGE OF THE VITAL STRATEGIC 
LIBERAL PARTY OF OUR COUNTRY IN 
TERMS OF FIGHTING TERRORISM IN THE 
TERMS OF THE MIDDLE EAST 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT THE LATEST ARMS 
DEAL TO SELL TYPHOON JETS IS SIGNED 
AND SEALED BUT THE SAUDIS WILL BE 
WATCHING TO SEE IF THE SERIOUS 
FRAUD OFFICE REOPENS ITS PROBE 
MEANWHILE THE GOVERNMENT IS FACING 
DAMNING REACTIONS 
IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COURT RULING 
THE COUNTRY WOULD BE MADE TO LOOK 
LIKE THE BANANA REPUBLIC IN WHICH 
HE ARE HAPPY TO SUSPEND THE RULE OF 
LAW IN AND AMIDST THE UNDETAILED 
UNSPOKEN THREATS OF ANOTHER 
GOVERNMENT 
WHATEVER 
THE ARMS DEALS GOVERNMENT THE RULING SENDS A MESSAGE BRITISH 
GIST MUST REMAIN IMMUNE FROM 
FOREIGN INTERVENTION 
ONE OF THE GROUPS MOUNTING THE 
SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGE WAS THE 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST ARMS TRADE 
NICHOLAS GILBEY FROM THAT GROUP 
JOINS US IN THE STUDIO ALONG WITH 
A FORMER ROYAL AIR FORCE OFFICER 
IN THE LIGHT OF THE DECISION TODAY 
ARE YOU TO PUSH FOR AN INQUIRY TO 
BE REOPENED INTO ALL OF THIS AGAIN 
YES WE WAND THE SERIOUS FRAUD 
OFFICE RE OPENED IT WAS IMPORTANT 
TO REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS CLOSED OFF 
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IT WAS SAID TO BE THOUGHT 
THAT THERE WERE EIGHTEEN MONTHS' WORTH OF 
INVESTIGATION STILL TO GO 
ROPERED WARDEL IS FROM THE SERIOUS 
FRAUD OFFICE YES YES SO IT IS BEST TO BRING EVERYTHING 
OUT INTO THE OPEN DOES THIS HAVE 
ANY JUSTICE 
IT GOT TO THE STAGE 
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE U. K. TO FIND 
SO THE SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE SAID 
THEY WANTED TO LOOK IN THE SWISS 
BANK ACCOUNTS OF THE PRINCE HE 
SAID HE DID NOT WANT THAT 
THIS IS THE SAUDI PRINCE 
YES ALL 
WE CAN DO IS TO GO INTO THE SWISS 
BANK ACCOUNT TO FISH TO FIND 
SOMETHING IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME 
IF THEY SAID NO 
SO NICHOLAS GILBEY WHY REOPEN 
THIS THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS 
THIS DEAL HAPPYED YEARS AGO LET 
SLEEPING DOGS LIE 
THE ALLEGATIONS 
RELATES TO A PERIOD MORE CURRENT 
THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO THE PERIOD RANGED 
FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE TO TWO THOUSAND ONE WHERE THE ANTI 
CORRUPTION LEGISLATION WAS BROUGHT 
IN THE REASON TO REOPEN IT IS THAT 
THE ALLEGATIONS ARE SERIOUS AND 
SUSTAINED THEY SHOULD BE FULLY 
INVESTIGATED SO PEOPLE CAN HAVE 
CONFIDENCE IN WHETHER OR NOT A 
CRIMINAL OFFENCE IS COMMITTED 
ANDREW BROOKES 
YOU CAN ASK BUT 
THEY WILL NOT YOU ARE ASKING A 
FOREIGN NATIONAL TO OPEN UP HIS 
BANK ACCOUNT IN SWITZERLAND TO THE 
POLICE WHO HAVE NO EVIDENCE 
YOU MAY BE RIGHT YOU MAYBE WRONG 
BUT I SUSPECT YOU ARE WHIFTLING IN 
THE WIND FOR THEM TO DO THAT THERE 
IS NO CRIME COMMITTED POST TWO THOUSAND ONE 
THAT THE POLICE HAVE FOUND SO HOW 
FAR BACK DO YOU GO AND FOR WHAT 
PURPOSE 
NICHOLAS GILBEY TONY BLAIR PURPOSE MAINTAINED IT WAS NOT IN THE 
INTERESTS FOR THE U. K. TO LOOK AT THE 
AL YAMAMAH IDEAL THE SAUDIS ARE 
IMPORTANT ALLIES THAT PRINCIPLE 
HOLDS SURELY 
CORRUPTION IS 
IMPORTANT AND ENDEMIC C. H. NOBODY NOBODY HAS PROVED CORRUPTION THESE ARE 
ALLEGATIONS OF COURSE INDEED INDEED BAWL ALLEGATIONS WHEN AT THE ARE 
SERIOUS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED 
OTHERWISE WE ARE SAYING THAT THE 
RULE OF LAW DOES NOT APPLY ANDREW ANDREW BROOKES YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT THE 
DAMAGE TO U. K. P. L. C. HAS REALLY BEEN 
ASTONISHING THIS WAS A VERY VERY 
STINGING REBUKE A KICK IN THE 
TEETH TOT BRITISH GOVERNMENT THERE THERE ARE TWO PARALLEL UNIVERSES THE LAW 
LOOKING AT THEORY AND DARE I SAY 
IT MILITARY REALITY WHICH WILL 
CARRY ON SO NOTHING IS TO ALTER 
THE EXECUTIVE IT WILL CARRY ON 
DOING WHAT IT DOES THE LEGAL SIDE 
COMES UP WITH THIS IT IS VERY GOOD 
IT ESTABLISHING PRECEDENT BUT THIS 
IS STILL AN ALLEGATIONS NOTHING IS 
PROVEN NOBODY HAS EVIDENCE I 
SUSPECT ALTHOUGH PEOPLE MAY ASK FOR 
AN ENQUIRY NOTHING WILL TAKE PLACE 
BUT THE PERCEPTION IS THAT IN THE 
UNITED KINGDOM THEY CALLED FOR 
THIS CORRUPTION PROBE ON THE 
CALLS OFF THE CORRUPTION PROBE ON 
THE GROUNDS OF SECURITY EVERYONE 
COULD DO AT THAT 
IF THIS WAS IN 
PARIS WASHINGTON IT WOULD NOT HAVE 
GOTTEN TO FIRST BASE AT LEAST THE 
BRITS HAVE A SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE 
THAT GOT NOWHERE DARE I SAY IT 
OTHER NATIONS DOING IT HAVE NOT 
EVEN STARTED SO YOU CAN ARGUE THAT 
THE BRITS ARE TRYING WHEN THEY 
COULD NOT GET ANYWHERE THEY 
STOPPED IT BUT THEY DID TRY TO GO 
SOMEWHERE IT DID NOT HAPPEN IN 
PARIS 
THE LAST SENTENCE TO YOU PARIS ANDREW ANDREW THE CLEAR FACT IS THAT THE 
INVESTIGATION THE REASON THAT THE 
INVESTIGATION NEVER FOUND ANYTHING 
IT WAS NOT ALLOWED TO CONCLUDE 
GILCHRIST AND ANDREW BROOKES THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW IN WASHINGTON GEORGE BUSH HAS 
CONFIRMED THAT ALL FIVE U. S. BRIGADES 
SENT TO IRAQ LAST YEAR AS PART OF 
THE SURGE STRATEGY WOULD BE 
WITHDRAWN BY JULY HE SAID THAT 
AFTER THAT HE WOULD HALT ANY 
FURTHER WITHDRAWALS UNTIL THE U. S. 
COMMANDER IN IRAQ GENERAL DAVID 
PETRAEUS HAD ASSESSED MILITARY 
NEEDS HE INDICATED THAT A 
SOLDIER'S TOUR OF DUTY IN IRAQ 
WOULD BE REDUCE FROM FIFTEEN MONTHS TO A 
YEAR PRESIDENT BUSH SAID THAT THE 
SURGE HAD WORKED 
THE GOAL OF THE SURGE WAS TO BRING 
DOWN THE SECTARIAN VIOLENCE THAT 
THREATENED TO OVERWHELM THE 
GOVERNMENT IN BAGHDAD RESTORE 
BASIC SECURITY TO THE IRAQI 
COMMUNITIES AND DRIVE THE HOSTILES 
OUT OF THE COMMUNITIES AS GENERAL 
DAVID PETRAEUS TOLD CONGRESS

SIGNIFICANT PROGRESSES IN THE AREAS

HOPED THAT IT WOULD BRING TO END 
MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS OF CONFLICT THE 
HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC 
COMMITTEE HAS SAID THAT ANTI CHINA 
PROTEST IN THE TORCH RELAY 
REPRESENTS A CRISIS FOR THE GAMES 
IT IS A RESPECT FOR THE CHINESE'S 
MORAL ENGAGEMENT ON HUMAN RIGHTS

RUN OFF WE WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN 
A RUN OFF BECAUSE WE WON THAT 
ELECTION ELECTION FURTHER WE WILL NOT ACCEPT A RUN 
OFF AND THE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES 
WHERE THAT RUN OFF SIMPLY 
EXACERBATES A SITUATION OF 
SUFFERING FOR OUR PEOPLE 
THE M. D. C. ING IS TALKING 
STPHR THE ARE BARNED FROM TALKING 
IN THE B. B. C. ARE BANNED FROM 
TALKING IN ZIM WE HAVE OUR 
CORRESPONDENT D. TALKING IN 
ZIMBABWE WE HAVE OUR CORRESPONDENT

IS TO THROW THE BALL INTO THE COURT 
OF THE NEIGHBOURING HEADS OF STATE 
THERE IS THE MEETING HE IS REFERING 
TO IN ZAMBIA WHAT MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI THE LEADER OF THE 
OPPOSITION HAS BEEN DOING IS FLYING 
AROUND THE REGION TALKING TO 
PRESIDENTS OF NEIGHBOURING STATES 
SAYING THAT THEY HAVE TO TELL 
MUGABE TO HIS FACE THAT HE HAS LOST

TO HIS ASSISTANCE HIS AID AND 
THEN ROBERT MUGABE WALKS OUT 
TRIUMPANT TRIUMPANT AND IT IS SAID THAT THEY ARE 
THERE ARE SOME NEIGHBOURING STATES 
THAT ARE NOT GOING TO INVITE HIM TO 
SAY HE MUST STEP DOWN 
BUT THERE IS ROBERT MUGABE AND 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI BOTH SAYING THEY 
ARE TO ATTEND THIS SMITH IS THIS A 
FIRST STEP TO FINDING A SOLUTION 
IT DEPENDS ON THE COALITION THAT 
EMERGES THEY LOOK TO SOUTH AFRICA 
FOR LEADERSHIP ON THIS SO FAR 
THABO MBEKI THE SOUTH AFRICAN 
PRESIDENT HAS PUT HIS TRUST IN 
QUIET DIP PALACE MASSEY SAYING 
LITTLE CONDEMNING NOTHING AND HE 
HAS NOT CONDEMNED SO FAR THE 
FAILURE OF THE ZIM ZIM ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION TO RELEASE THE RESULTS 
OF THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE THAT TOOK 
PLACE TWELVE DAYS AGO WHAT THE M. D. C. ARE 
SAYING IS THAT THE LONGER THAT GOES 
ON MBEKI'S SILENCE LOOKS LIKE 
COMPLICE COME POLICE UNIONIST 
WITH WHATEVER MUGABE IS DOING 
THE PARENTS OF KHANDU WANGCHUCK 
WENT TO THE PARLIAMENT TO APPEAL 
FOR A BETTER TRACKING SYSTEM FOR 
MISSING CHILDREN THEY URGED THE 
MEPS TO BACK A SCHEME THAT COULD 
DELIVER INFORMATION ON CHILDREN 
LOST ACROSS THE CONTINENT IT IS 
MODELLED ON A SIMILAR SYSTEM IN THE 
UNITED STATES CALLED THE AMBER 
ALERT IT TAKES ITS NAME AFTER A 
NINE YEAR OLD TEXTAN GIRL AMBER 
HAGERMAN KIDNAPPED AND MURDERED 
AFTER HER DEATH THE COMMUNITY 
DISCOVERED THAT THE POLICE 
AUTHORITIES MIGHT HAVE HAD INFORMS 
THAT COULD HAVE SAVED HER BUT THEY 
HAD NO MEANS TO DISTRIBUTE THE 
INFORMATION THE MCCANN FAMILY HAVE 
BEEN CAMPAIGNING IN BRUSSELS 
IT IS NEARLY A YEAR SINCE MADELEINE 
MCCANN DISAPPEARED SINCE EUROPE 
WAS ASKED TO LOCK FOR A LITTLE 
GIRLMENT LOOK FOR A LITTLE GIRL 
HER PARENTS KEEP THE CAMPAIGN GOING 
TODAY IT BROUGHT THEM TO THE 
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT THEY WERE HERE 
FOR THIS TO ENCOURAGE MEPS TO 
ADOPT AN AMERICAN STYLE ALERT 
SYSTEM TO BE USED WHEN A CHILD 
I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL DISAPPEARS AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH 
REGARD TO MADELEINE'S ABDUCTION 
MADELEINE WAS AN INCREDIBLY HAPPY 
CONFIDENT AND VERY LOVED LITTLE 
GIRL THIS TIME LAST YEAR WE WERE A 
VERY HAPPY FAMILY WE FELT VERY 
LUCKY 
THE KEY POINT IS WE WANT LUCKY INFORMATION KEY INFORMATION TO BE 
DISSEMINATED TO THE PUBLIC TO 
GALVANISE THEIR RESPONSE AND LOAD 
TO THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF 
RECOVERY OF THE CHILD 
THEY WERE 
HERE FOR POLICY BUT WITH THE 
MCCANNS IT'S DIFFERENT THEY ARE 
STILL SUSPECTS IN THEIR DAUGHTER'S 
DISAPPEARANCE JOURNALISTS AND 
CAMERA CREWS FOLLOWING THEM 
WHEREVER THEY GO THEY SAY THEY 
WANTED TO EXPLAIN WHAT THEY HAVE 
BEEN THROUGH 
YOU KNOW IT'S 
IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW JUST 
EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH 
WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT 
MADELEINE'S GONE THROUGH 
I THINK 
IT IS AN ISSUE THAT UNLESS YOU'VE 
BEEN EXPERIENCED IT IT'S JUST 
UNBELIEVABLE IT DRIVES US IN TERMS 
OF TRYING TO EFFECT CHANGE IT'S 
STILL RAW NOT AS RAW AS IT WAS 
LAST YEAR BUT IT'S LIKE SOMETHING 
OUT OF A HORROR 
THE MCCANNS SPENT 
THE AFTERNOON LOBYING FOR CHANGE 
THEY BELIEVE AN EARLY WARNING 
SYSTEM COULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE 
ON THE NIGHT MADELEINE DISAPPEARED 
THE CAMPAIGN GOES ON THE 
INVESTIGATION GOES ON NEARLY ONE 
YEAR ON IN REALITY WE ARE NO 
NEARER KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED TO 
MADELEINE MCCANN 
MORE NOW ON ONE OF OUR TOP STORIES 
PRESIDENT BUSH HAS SAID THAT WHILST 
HE WILL BE IN FEW CHURG FUTURE 
SHORTENING TOURS IN IRAQ FOR 
SOLDIERS THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER 
REDUCTIONS IN TROOP NUMBERS AFTER 
JULY THAT WON'T PLEASE CRITICS WHO 
SAID U. S. ARMED FORCES ARE BEING 
STRETCHED TOO THIN AND THAT TOO 
MANY SACRIFICES HAVE BEEN MADE 
MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND AMERICAN TROOPS 
HAVE DIED IN IRAQ 
JUSTIN WEBB TRAVELLED TO A VERMONT 
TOWN WHERE THE SACRIFICE AND THE 
MEMORIES ARE VERY REAL 
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IN THE 
LONG WINTERS AND THE SHORT SUMMERS 
OF THEIR NATIVE VERMONT STEPHEN 
AND MARION GRAY WILL BE COMING HERE 
TO A CORNER OF THEIR FAMILY FARM I I WISH TODAY WOULD STAY UP 
THEIR SON 
JAMIE IS BURIED IN THIS FROZEN 
GROUND HE WAS KILLED IN IRAQ ON 
JUNE SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND FOUR HE'D BEEN THERE JUST 
THREE MONTHS 
WE MOVED HERE WHEN HE 
WAS ONE YEAR OLD THERE WAS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
ACRES HERE HE KNEW ALL OF IT WE 
SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE WOODS 
THEY MADE DO WITH THE SAME THINGS 
THAT I DID WHEN I GROU UP HERE 
JAMIE GRAY IS UNUSUAL IN ONE 
RESPECT THE FAMILY FARM IS CLOSE 
TO THE TOWN OF BARRY HOME TO THE 
COMPANY THAT CRAFTS THE HEAD STONES 
FOR THOSE WHO DIE IN IRAQ AND 
AFGHANISTAN THE STONE IS LOCAL 
THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS STIPULATES 
THAT IT MUST BE AMERICAN BECAUSE 
ALTHOUGH THIS FACTORY IS LOUD AND 
FULL OF DUST AND ACTIVITY THOUGH 
IT'S JUST AS YOU'D EXPECT IT TO BE 
IT'S THE FIRST STEP IN THE FORMAL 
PROCESS OF REMEMBERING THE WAR DEAD 
MARION GRAY CAME HERE TO SEE HER 
SON'S STONE BEING MADE THE 
PERMANENCE OF IT GIVES HER COMFORT 
THAT'S WHAT REALLY MEANS THE MOST 
TO THE FAMILIES HELPS THEM TO DEAL 
LIVE WITH IT ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS 
IS KNOWING THAT THEY'RE NOT 
FORGOTTEN THAT THEIR SACRIFICES 
WILL BE REMEMBERED 
VETERANS OF ANY 
WAR CAN HAVE A HEAD STONE MADE HERE 
THIS IS A BUSY PLACE IT'S AN 
INDUSTRIAL PROCESS WHOSE END POINT 
IS INTENSELY PERSONAL 
OUR JAMIE 
SAID HE WANTED THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ 
TO KNOW WHAT A WONDERFUL LIFE HE 
HAD ON OUR HOME FARM HE WANTED 
THEM TO BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THOSE 
FREEDOMS JUST NOT LIVE IN FEAR 
FROM DAY TO DAY THAT'S WHAT HE 
WANTED TO DO 
A LOCAL MUSEUM HAS A 
MEMORIAL TO JAMIE AND THE OTHER 
VERMONTERS WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED THIRTY THREE 
PHOTOGRAPHS PROPORTIONATELY AMONG 
THE HIGHEST LOSSES OF ANY STATE 
THIS IS WHERE AMERICA DOES ITS 
GRIEVING NOT IN WASHINGTON BUT IN 
SMALL COMMUNITIES THE LENGTH AND 
BREADTH OF THIS COUNTRIES 
COUNTRY ONLY HALF OF ONE PER CENT OF 
AMERICANS ARE ON ACTIVE MILITARY 
DUTY IT'S EASY TO AVOID THE WAR 
UNLESS IT FINDS YOUR FAMILY 
IN IRAQ ITSELF THE DREAM OF A 
PEACEFUL LIFE FOR MANY IS JUST THAT 
A DREAM ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT BUSH 
SAID TODAY IRAQI CIVILIANS WERE 
SUFFERING LESS FROM VIOLENCE LOCAL 
RESIDENTS THERE SAY THEY NEED MORE 
THAN WORDS OF REASSURANCE TO 
REVERSE THE EFFECT OF YEARS OF 
FIGHTING FIGHTING IN THE MIDDLE OF WARTIME BAGHDAD 
YOU CAN FIND A LITTLE BASTION OF 
CALM AND COLOUR HOLDING OUT 
AGAINST THE BARBED WIRE THE BOMBS 
AND THE CASUAL TERROR OF LIFE HERE 
IT'S THE BAGHDAD GARDEN CENTRE AND 
FOR ABU ALAN THIS IS A PATH OUT OF 
THE WAR IRAQIS HAVE A MILLION 
STRATEGIES FOR COPING AND THIS 
GENTLE RATHER RECLUSIVE MAN HAS 
BUILT A SORT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL 
BUNKER OUT OF THE FOLIAGE 
THIS IS 
SENARIA MANY COLOURS 
HE DOESN'T 
GO OUT MUCH HE PASSES THE YEARS IN 
HIS TINY GARDEN AND WAITS FOR 
CHANGE SOME PEOPLE WANT TO BUILD 
SOME PEOPLE WANT TO DESTROY I JUST 
HOPE THE BUILDERS WILL WIN IN THE 
NEXT FEW YEARS 
BUT HOW DO YOU MEASURE WHETHER THIS 
WAR IN IRAQ IS GOING WELL OR GOING 
BADLY WELL YOU CAN CALCULATE THE 
NUMBER OF BOMB ATTACKS YOU CAN 
CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES 
THE NUMBER OF SECTARIAN MURDERS 
THAT TAKE PLACE ON THE STREETS OF 
BAGHDAD EVERY NIGHT BUT ONE THING 
YOU CAN NEVER CALCULATE IS THE WAY 
IN WHICH THIS WAR HAS INVADED 
PEOPLE'S LIVES AND ONE FEARED 
LITTLE DISCUSSED INVASION OF LIFE 
PLAYS OUT HERE THE DETENTION CAMPS 
RUN BY THE AMERICAN MILITARY 
INSIDE ARE THOSE SUSPECTED OF 
TERRORISM IN A BAGHDAD PARK WE MET 
A MAN WHO WAS ARRESTED IN AN 
AMERICAN RAID WE CAN'T SHOW YOU 
HIS FACE BUT HE'S A BUTCHER BY 
TRADE HE SHOWS US THE BLASTIC 
IDENTITY BRACELET THE SOLDIERS 
STRAPPED TO HIS WRIST HE WAS ONLY 
RELEASED AFTER EIGHT MONTHS 
WITHOUT EVER SEEING A LAWYER OR A 
JUDGE JUDGE 
I LOST MY JOB I CAN'T WORK NOW AND MY NEIGHBOURS AND 
EVEN MY RELATIVES LOOK DOWN ON ME 
AS IF I WERE A TERRORIST I'M NOT 
I USED TO THINK THE AMERICANS WERE 
GREAT PEOPLE BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY 
MORE 
WAS THE LOCAL BUTCHER AIDING MORE AL QAEDA WE DON'T KNOW BUT THE 
AMERICANS RELEASED HIM WHICH 
STRONGLY SUGGESTS THEY'D DECIDED HE 
WAS INNOCENT AS OF TODAY THE 
NUMBER OF IRAQI PEOPLE HELD 
INDEFINITELY IN AMERICAN CAMPS 
STANDS AT JUST UNDER TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND 
THE NUMBERS ONLY TELL PART OF THAT 
STORY STORY LET'S REMIND YOU OF OUR TOP 
STORIES THE HIGH COURT IN LONDON 
HAS SAID A CORRUPTION INQUIRY BY 
THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES INTO A 
MASSIVE ARMS DEAL WITH SAUDI ARABIA 
SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HALTED THE 
INVESTIGATION BY THE SERIOUS FRAUD 
OFFICE WAS STOPPED TWO YEARS AGO 
AFTER THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT 
THREATENED BRITAIN'S NATIONAL 
INTERESTS INTERESTS IN WASHINGTON GEORGE BUSH HAS 
CONFIRMED THIS ALL FIVE U. S. BRIGADES 
SENT TO IRAQ LAST YEAR AS PART OF 
THE SURGE STRATEGY WILL BE 
WITHDRAWN BY JULY HE SAID THAT 
AFTER THAT HE WOULD HALT FURTHER 
WITHDRAWALS UNTIL THE U. S. COMMANDER 
IN IRAQ GENERAL PETRAEUS ASSESSED 
MILITARY NEEDS THIS IS WORLD NEWS 
TODAY TODAY THAT IS ALL FROM THE PROGRAMME 
NEXT ON B. B. C. FOUR IT'S THE WEATHER 
FOR NOW FROM ME AND THE REST OF 
THE TEAM GOODBYE 
HELLO THERE IT IS OF COURSE APRIL 
IT IS THE MONTH OF SHOWERS SO NO 
SURPRISES WHAT OUR HEADLINE MAY BE 
FOR TOMORROW SOME EASTERN AREAS OF 
ENGLAND HAVE MANAGED TO AVOID THE 
SHOWERS IN THE LAST FEW DAYS NOT 
SO IN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE AREA 
LOW PRESSURE DRIVING OUR WEATHER 
JUST ROLLING ITS WAY EASTWARDS AND 
PUSHING SHOWERS THROUGH A ALONG 
WITH IT FOR FRIDAY MOST PARTS OF 
THE U. K. SEEING HEAVY SHOWERS AT SOME 
STAGE THAT FOCUS DEFINITELY 
SHIFTING FURTHER EASTWARDS BY THE 
AFTERNOON SOME OF THE HEAVIEST 
SHOWERS POSSIBLY AROUND THE U. K. ON 
FRIDAY THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN THE 
LAST FEW DAYS SOME SHARP SHOWERS 
ACROSS SCOTLAND TOMORROW AFTERNOON 
MAY BE ACCOMPANIED BY HAIL AND 
THUNDER A SIMILAR STORY ACROSS 
NORTHERN ENGLAND AND THE MIDLANDS 
A BIG CHANGE FOR THE SOUTH EAST OF 
ENGLAND WHERE FOR MUCH OF THIS 
WEEK IT'S BEEN A DRY AND SUNNY 
STORY SOME REALLY NOTABLE 
OUTBREAKS OF RAIN COMING THROUGH 
HERE THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
THOUGH AND WALES A CHANGE WE WILL 
START THE DAY WITH PRETTY POTENT 
SHOWERS AROUND THERE WILL BE A FEW 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON IN GENERAL 
IN CONTRAST TO WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY FRIDAY AFTERNOON SHOULD 
BE A LOT QUIETER FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND THOUGH STILL THE SHOWERS 
SWIRLING IN THE LOW PRESSURE DOES 
STAY WITH US FOR SATURDAY IF YOU 
KEEP YOUR EYE ON THESE BANDS HERE 
THE MORE ORGANISED BANDS OF SHOWERS 
THEY WILL TUCK OUT OF THE WAY TO 
THE EAST ON SATURDAY ALLOWING A 
QUIETER SPELL OF WEATHER TO PUSH 
INTO ENGLAND AND WALES FOR 
SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND IT 
STILL LOOKS LIKE WE'LL SEE FREQUENT 
AND HEAVY SHOWERS 
THE TARGETS CHANGE THE TERROR DOES NOT 
THE BLOODY HISTORY OF FORTY YEARS OF TERRORISM
