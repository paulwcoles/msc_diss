IT HAS BEEN A CONTINUATION OF THE 
SEMI FINALS AT THE WORLD SNOOKER 
CHAMPIONSHIP AND THE 
MATCH BETWEEN 
ALI 
CARTER AND 
JOE PERRY WILL BE 
FEATURED LATER WE 
WENT TO 
START 
FEATURED LATER WITH THE MATCH BETWEEN STEPHEN 
HENDRY AND RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN WAS IN GENIUS 
WOULD HE LEADS A NINE TO FOUR AS WE JOIN 
THE ACTION AT FRAME FOURTEEN 
COMMENTATORS ARE JOHN VIRGO AND 
WILLIE THORNE 
RONNIE WILL TAKE THIS ON THAT IS 
SHOCKED SHORT 
STEPHEN WILL BE DISAPPOINTED THAT 
HE DID NOT REACH THE CUSHION AND 
THE FACT THAT THE YELLOW IS OFF ITS 
SPOT MEANS HE IS STILL ON A COLOUR 
HE WILL BE FEELING THAT LIKE HE 
HAS NOT PLAYED AND SHORT THIS 
MORNING IN THE LAST THREE FRAMES 
HE HAS JUST SAT AND WATCHED UNLIKE UNLIKE OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN ENJOYING THE 
PLEA OF RONNIE O'SULLIVAN STEPHEN 
WILL NOT BE SEEING IT THAT WAY 
TO PLAY AT THE MOMENT I AM NOT 
CERTAIN WHERE HIS NEXT FRAME COMES 
FROM 
COUPLE OF LOOSE REDS HE DOES NOT 
HAVE THE PERFECT ANGLE TO GET ON TO 
THE BLACK HE WOULD LIKE TO GO INTO 
THE FOUR REDS ABOVE THE BLACK SPOT 
THIS IS PERFECT HE HAS THE ANGLE 
TO PLAY INTO THE FOUR REDS 
THERE IT IS HE NEVER MISSES THOSE 
THE WHITE GOES INTO THE PACK TWICE 
JUST TO BRING EVERYTHING INTO PLAY 
HE MAKES THE WHITE GO IN AT SPEED 
RONNIE NEVER GOES INTO THE BUNCH 
WITH ADDED WHITE HE ALWAYS MAKES 
THINGS HAPPEN WITH ADDED WEIGHT 
WITH A DEAD WHITE 
HE DOES EVERYTHING SO QUICKLY WHEN 
HE IS BREAK BUILDING STEPHEN 
HENDRY PLAYS BAD SAFETY AND 
ALMOST FIVE MINUTES LATER IT IS 
FRAME BALL AGAIN THE REDS AND THE 
CAUSE MINUS THREE REDS AND THREE COLOURS 
THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME EVEN 
HENDRY HAS LOST NINE ON THE TROT 
SINCE HE LOST NINE ON THE TROT TO 
MARCUS CAMPBELL 
HE IS NOT PERFECT ON THE BLUE HE 
COULD PLAY LITTLE CANNON HERE TO 
WIN BY THE PACK HE COULD RUN BY 
OFF TWO CUSHIONS IT IS PERFECT 
WAS NOT SURE IF THAT SHOT WAS ON 
THAT WAS BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED COULD 
BE BACK TO BACK CENTURIES 
THE APPLAUSE TELL YOU THAT THE 
FRAME IS OVER 
DOESN'T SEEM TO PLAY WELL AND 
SECOND SESSIONS AGAINST RONNIE 
STEPHEN HENDRY PREVIOUSLY HE LOST 
SEVEN ON THE TROT IN THE SECOND 
SESSION BUT NINE ON THE TROT IS A 
RECORD 
HE MADE A BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE IN THE LAST 
FRAME AND HIS CONTROL OF THE CUE 
BALL WAS POETRY IN MOTION THIS 
FRAME IF ANYTHING IS SLIGHTLY 
BETTER HE IS CUEING LIKE A DREAM 
WHEN HE WAS NINE TO SEVEN IN FRONT OF MARK 
WILLIAMS HE PLAYED FOUR FRAMES TO 
GOING FRONT AND IT WAS THE BEST 
FOUR FRAMES I HAVE SEEN IN LONG 
TIME AND IT IS ALL BECAUSE STEPHEN 
DID NOT TAKE HIS CHANCES AND THE 
OPENING THREE RINGS RONNIE IS 
TAKING LIFT FROM THE FACT THAT 
STEPHEN IS STRUGGLING TO POT 
SOMETIMES IF YOU LET THIS MAN 
LOOSE YOU CAN SEE WHAT HE CAN DO 
HENDRY IS A GENIUS BUT UNDOUBTEDLY 
RONNIE IS ALSO A GENIUS TWO OF THE 
GREATEST PLAYERS OF ALL TIME ONE 
OF THEM TOTALLY IN COMMAND OF THIS 
SESSION 
THERE IS A POSSIBLE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE ON WHICH 
ECLIPSED THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE OF THE PREVIOUS 
FRAME 
TWO TOTAL CLEARANCES ON THE TROT 
IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN GOES TEN TO FOUR CLEAR 
RONNIE TOOK THE LAST TWO FRAMES OF 
THE MORNING SESSION TO READ TWELVE TO FOUR 
THIS WAS THE REACTION TO THAT FROM 
THE PRESS LOW 
WHAT RONNIE DID TWO STEPHEN THIS 
MORNING WAS WHAT STEPHEN USED TO DO 
TO OPPONENTS THROUGHOUT THE NINETEEN NINETIES 
HE CAPITALISED ON ANY MISTAKE THAT 
WAS ONE OF THE GREAT SESSIONS EVER 
AT THE CRUCIBLE 
WHEN THE PRESSURE 
CAME OFTEN AFTER THE CLIPS THE 
FIRST COUPLE OF FRAMES HE PLAYED 
HIS 
RULE GAME 
AND IT WAS POETRY IN 
MOTION 
THAT REMINDED US OF RONNIE MOTION ALSO WILL THEN 
AT HIS 
BEST WHEN 
HIS MIND 
IS 
ON THE 
JOB HE 
IS THE 
BEST IN 
THE BUSINESS THERE IS NO 
DEBATE 
COULD HE KEEP IT GOING THIS DEBATE EVENING HERE IS THE FIRST FRAME OF 
TONIGHT'S SESSION 
THERE ARE LOOSE REDS O'SULLIVAN IS 
A MASTER OF OPENING THE BUNCH 
WITHOUT LOSING POSITION 
IF HE IS STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK HE 
HAS RESTRICTED HIS POSITIONAL 
OPTIONS FROM THAT PAUL THAT BALL 
HE CANNOT GET THROUGH TO THE PINK 
THIS IS NOT STRAIGHT FOR WORK IF 
HE PLAYS THE SCREW BACK HE WILL 
COLLIDE WITH THE 
RED NEAR 
THE RIGHT 
HAND CUSHION SO THAT WILL NOT HELP 
COULD PLAY FOR THE PINK AND HE IS 
LUCKY TO HAVE IT AS A SECOND OPTION 
STILL ONE RED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
CLUSTER THAT IS AVAILABLE THAT HE 
CAN PLAY FOR 
USUALLY IN THOSE SITUATIONS RONNIE 
LEAVES HIMSELF A LITTLE FOR POTTING 
THE RED AND THEN BRINGING OTHER 
REDS INTO PLAY THAT IS THE CASE 
HERE HE MADE CERTAIN HE WAS BACK 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE WITH 
THAT CUE BALL BUT HE ONLY BOUGHT 
ONE RED INTO PLAY BROUGHT 
HENDRY KNOWS THIS FRAME IS OVER FOR 
AND IF O'SULLIVAN CAN GET THE BUNCH 
OPEN FOUR FOR HIM 
WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT NOTHING LESS 
HE PLAYED THE CANNON AND HIT THE 
PERFECT RED TO SPLIT THEM OPEN IT 
IS ANOTHER FRAME IN THE BAG 
O'SULLIVAN HAS PICKED UP WHERE HE 
LEFT OFF AT LUNCHTIME AN EXHIBITION OF SUPREME SKILL 
CAN ALSO THEN MAKE HIS TEN CENTURY 
OF THIS CHAMPIONSHIPS CAN ALSO 
WILL THEN CAN O'SULLIVAN HE HAS JUST NUDGED THE RED UNLUCKY 
IT LOOKS AS IF IT IS AUTOMATIC HE HE IS FRIGHTENINGLY GOOD 
O'SULLIVAN CERTAINLY DOING HIS BIT 
TOWARDS SETTING NEW RECORD OF 
TOTAL CENTURIES FOR THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP THIS IS NUMBER FIFTY EIGHT 
THE RECORD IS SIXTY EIGHT 
O'SULLIVAN'S FOR TOTAL CLEARANCE OF 
THE GAME YOU CANNOT ARGUE WITH THE 
AFFECTION THAT IS TWELVE FRAMES IN A 
ROW FOR O'SULLIVAN 
HENDRY GOT TWO 
FRAMES ON THE BOARD THIS EVENING 
BUT WAS ONLY DELAYING THE 
INEVITABLE HE THEN LEFT THIS BLACK 
OVER THE POCKET AND CONCEDED 
THIS WAS THE ACTION OF BOTH PLAYERS 
AFTERWARDS 
I WAS NERVOUS AT THE AFTERWARDS START BECAUSE I HAVE GOT SO MUCH 
RESPECT FOR STEPHEN'S GAME AND 
ABILITY TO PRODUCE IT WHEN IT 
MATTERS I HAVE SEEN IT WITH MARK 
WILLIAMS THERE WAS A PANG OF 
ANTICIPATION WITH SOMEONE LIKE 
STEPHEN THAT HE CAN JUST CLEAR UP 
AND YOU CAN BE SITTING IN YOUR 
CHAIR FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME BUT 
I GOT A FRAME 
ON THE 
BOARD AND 
I JUST 
THOUGHT STAY 
RELAXED 
THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO L. HAVE 
HAD ONE BAD SESSION BECKETT 
THINKING THAT I COULD CLAW IT BACK 
AND TODAY COULD NOT HAVE GONE ANY 
BETTER 
THAT IS AS COMPREHENSIVELY BETTER OUTPLAYED AS I HAVE BEEN IN MY 
CAREER I CANNOT REMEMBER RONNIE 
MISSING A BALL THIS AFTERNOON IT 
WAS FAULTLESS THE CUP OUTSTANDING 
AND HIS SAFETY PLAY WAS 
UNBELIEVABLE FAULTLESS SNOOKER 
THE ONLY TIME THAT I GOT TO THE 
TABLE WAS TO BREAK OFF OR TO PLAY 
FROM AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION 
HAVE TO ADMIRE IT BECAUSE IT WAS 
PERFECT SNOOKER 
ALL SEASON I HAVE 
BEEN ENJOYING MY PRACTICE AS LONG 
AS I CAN COMPETE THAT IS WHAT I 
HAVE DONE THERE ARE AREAS THAT I 
NEED TO IMPROVE ON BUT THE SESSION 
LIKE THIS MORNING ALTERNATE BUILDS 
CONFIDENCE ONCE I START TO GET 
COMFORTABLE AMONGST THE BALLS L. L. 
CANNOT BE TOO HARD ON MYSELF BUT I 
AM ALWAYS STRIVING TO HIT THE 
HEIGHTS I AM CAPABLE OF L. DO NOT 
THINK THAT IS A BAD THING L. ENJOY 
PLAYING WELL L. ENJOY PLAYING WELL 
WHEN I GET AMONGST THE BALLS 
STEPHEN IS NO DIFFERENT 
I FANCIED 
MY CHANCES L. GOT OFF TO A GOOD 
START BUT WHEN YOU LET RONNIE GET 
TWO OR THREE FRAMES IN FRONT HE IS 
UNSTOPPABLE SOME PLAYERS DO I ON 
CONFIDENCE IF YOU PUT HIM UNDER 
PRESSURE HE IS LIKE ANYONE CRACKS 
BUT I 
COULD NOT 
PUT HIM 
UNDER PRESSURE I AM NOT GETTING 
CARRIED AWAY 
I AM JUST GOING TO 
ENJOY THE FINAL TWO DAYS OF THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
IF HE PLAYS 
LIKE THAT HE 
WINS IT 
IT IS AS 
SIMPLE AS THAT 
THE OTHER SEMI 
FINAL FEATURE OF THE BIGGEST MATCH 
IN THE KEY AREAS 
OF JOE 
PERRY AND 
ALI CARTER IT WAS FIVE TO THREE OVERNIGHT 
AND CARTER TOOK FRAME NINE TO 
NARROW IT FOUR TO FIVE COMMENTARY FROM 
CLIVE EVERTON AND DENNIS TAYLOR 
HE TOOK HIS EYE OFF THE BLACK HOW 
MANY TIMES HAS JOE DON THAT IN THIS 
MATCH HE HAS GOT TO OVER FIFTY AND 
MISSED STRAIGHTFORWARD SHOT 
HOW MANY TIMES 
HAS HE DONE THAT IT IT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM THAT HAS PLAGUED 
HIM THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER MISSING 
IMPORTANT BALLS ON THE BRINK OF 
WINNING MATCHES OR FRAMES HE WAS 
WITHIN A COUPLE OF POTS OF GOING SIX 
FOUR AHEAD 
WELL THIS WILL HURT JOE PERRY IF 
ALI CARTER CAN CONVERT THIS CHANCE 
HE HAS A LONG WAY TO GO LOT OF 
BALLS TO POT BUT HE SHOULD NOT 
HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE 
JOE SHOULD HAVE ALREADY CLINCHED 
THE FRAME 
HE MIGHT EVEN PLAY FOR THE 
DIFFICULT RED THIS TIME HE DID NOT 
INTEND TO BUT IT COULD WORK TO HIS 
ADVANTAGE THAT IS O. K. WHAT A CHANCE NOW TO DRAW LEVEL 
JUST OVERSCREWED THAT SLIGHTLY HE 
WANTED A STRAIGHT RED AND PLAY FOR 
THE BLUE WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO 
GET TO THE YELLOW 
NOW HE HAS TO DO IT FROM THE BLACK 
AND IF HE HAS FINISHED DEAD 
STRAIGHT HE HAS MADE IT AWKWARD 
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUNCH IT AROUND 
THE ANGLES IT DEPENDS ON WHERE HE 
HAS FINISHED IF HE IS JUST OFF 
STRAIGHT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUNCH 
IT IN THE PINK WILL TAKE HIM NEAR 
THE END OF THE WHITE LINE ANYWAY HE NEEDS ALL THE COLOURS 
YOU COULD SEE HIS BACK HAND THERE 
YOU DON'T GRIP THE CUE TOO TIGHTLY 
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE A PROBLEM 
CLEARING UP HAVING SAID THAT HE 
HAS LEFT HIMSELF STRAIGHT ON THE 
BLUE HE DID IT UNDER EXTREME 
PRESSURE WHEN HE MADE A MAXIMUM 
BREAK HE TOOK THEM REALLY WELL 
JUST A TRICKY LITTLE PINK WHICH 
WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER IF HE HAD 
NOT BEEN STRAIGHT ON THE BLUE 
WELL JUST THE PRESSURE JUST THE 
TENSION JUST AN INSTANCE OF 
CLINCHER'S DISEASE HE WOULD HAVE 
POTTED IT NORMALLY BUT IT WAS THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SHOT RATHER 
THAN ITS INTRINSIC DIFFICULTY WHICH 
DEFEATED HIM WHERE IS THE PINK GOING TO FINISH 
WELL THIS IS A VERY TOUGH CUP BACK 
CUTBACK IF HE TAKES THE POT ON 
HE WILL HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK 
DOWN THE TABLE AND BACK UP AGAIN 
THAT IS THE ANGLE HE IS LOOKING AT 
JUST A SAFETY A GOOD CHOICE UNDER 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
PERRY IS IN DIFFICULTY BUT AT 
LEAST HE STILL IS IN THE FRAME HE 
DID NOT EXPECT TO BEAT WHEN CARTER 
STOOD OVER THE PINK FOR THE FIRST 
TIME HE DID NOT EXPECT TO BE 
NOT THE BEST BUT THIS IS A MUCH 
MORE DIFFICULT PINK THAN THE ONE 
THAT ALI MISSED HE CAN TAKE IT 
INTO THE RIGHT CORNER AND HE WOULD 
FINISH ON THE BLACK HE COULD TAKE 
IT IN THE LEFT CORNER AND FINISH ON 
THE BLACK BOTH POTS ARE TOUGH HE HAS NOT LEFT IT AT LEAST ADVANTAGE JOE PERRY 
THIS IS TOUGH IF HE TRIES TO 
DOUBLE THE PINK BACK UP THE TABLE 
HE COULD EASILY CATCH THE BLACK 
IF HE MISSED THE BLACK THE PINK 
WOULD HAVE GONE PAST THE BROWN SPOT 
BUT IT WAS SO TOUGH TO AVOID 
CANNONING INTO THE BLACK BUT THIS 
IS NOT A TOUGH ONE THAT JOE IS 
FACED WITH JUST A SAFETY SHOT THE 
POT IS TOO TOUGH 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE THE POT ON 
HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE SAFETY SHOT 
AND THEN HE SEEMED TO GET DOWN AND 
PLAY IT VERY QUICKLY 
GOT UP VERY 
QUICKLY IN DISGUST THE PINK ALMOST 
KNOCKED THE CUE BALL IN WHICH 
WOULD HAVE LEFT CARTER THE EASIEST 
OF PINKS 
THAT IS A GOOD SHOT BOTH PLAYERS 
HAVE HAD GOOD CHANCES TO WIN THIS 
FRAME 
AT LEAST THERE IS A CHANCE FRAME IF HE GETS THIS RIGHT BECAUSE THE 
PINK IS JUST AWAY FROM THE CUSHION 
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT A BIT OF 
DISTANCE BETWEEN CUE BALL AND THE 
PINK 
HE GOT THE RIGHT ANGLE HE PLAYED 
THAT VERY WELL 
HE HAS A GOOD SAFETY GAME PERRY 
BOTH IN ATTACK AND DEFENCE 
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THAT WAS A 
GREAT EFFORT NOW JOE HAS NOW GOT 
THE CHANCE BUT THAT WAS SO CLOSE 
FRAME BALL 
CARTER COULD ONLY SIT IN HIS CHAIR 
AND HOPE THAT PERRY DID NOT POT THE 
PINK NOW HE HAS GOT CHANCE 
HIMSELF TO TAKE PINK AND BLACK 
WELL THIS IS PROBABLY EVEN TOUGHER 
THAN THE ONE THAT JOE ATTEMPTED 
THERE AND HE HAS TO PLAY IT WITH 
QUITE A BIT OF SCREW IF HE WANTS TO 
GET ON THE BLACK YES 
PERRY HAD A GREAT CHANCE TO GO SIX TO FOUR 
UP 
HE MISSED A BLACK FROM ITS SPOT 
WITHIN COUPLE OF POTS OF 
CLINCHING IT ALI CARTER HAVING 
MISSED CHANCE HIMSELF FINALLY 
GETS HOME ON THE BLACK TO LEVEL AT 
FIVE TO FIVE 
ALI CARTER WENT ON TO TAKE THE NEXT 
THREE BEFORE PERRY CAME BACK AT 
HIM INCLUDING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN IN FRAME FIFTEEN 
THIS IS THE LAST FRAME OF THE DAY 
AND THERE IS NO SCORE 
HE DID NOT INTEND TO 
DOUBLE THE RED THAT FAR BACK UP 
IF HE FINISHES THE 
RIGHT SIDE OF THE BLUE HE CAN GO 
STRAIGHT INTO THE PINK FULL BALL 
SO A KEY SHOT COMING UP 
AS LONG AS THE RED IS NOT COVERED 
WITH THE BLUE WHEN THE BLUE IS RE 
SPOTTED IS HE UNLUCKY WELL HE IS 
WALKING ROUND THE TABLE BRISKLY SO 
MAYBE HE CAN SEE ENOUGH OF IT AND 
HE CAN AND MIGHT JUST BE ABLE TO 
IF HE DROPS IT IN HE WILL LEAVE A 
CHANCE OF THE BLUE 
THIS WAS HOW PERRY LET CARTER IN 
HE HIT THE RED HARDER THAN INTENDED 
BUT FOR THE KISS HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN CLOSER TO THIS RED 
IS HE 
GOING TO BE FULLY COMMITTED THERE 
IS A POSSIBLE POT ON AND HE COULD 
STUN ROUND THE BACK OF THE BLACK 
HE HAS FLICKED THE OTHER RED BUT 
IT IS O. K. IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE POT 
O. K. TO FLICK THE RED LIKE THAT AND 
FINISH ON THE BLACK A LITTLE GOOD 
FORTUNE BUT HE DESERVED IT AFTER 
THE POT 
THAT WAS A BIT UNLUCKY HE PLAYED 
THE CANNON WELL AND HE GOT THE 
WEIGHT TO STOP THERE HE GOT THE 
WHITE TO STOP BUT EVERYTHING IS A 
LITTLE AWKWARD THERE LOOKS TO BE 
ONE THAT WOULD CUT INTO THE RIGHT 
CORNER BUT HE WILL NEED THE REST TO 
DO IT BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED LOOKING PRETTY GOOD NOW 
IF HE CAN CONVERT THIS CHANCE AND 
TAKE THE LAST FRAME OF THE SESSION 
HE WILL BE MORE THAN PLEASED IT 
WOULD MEAN HE HAD WON THE SESSION 
SIX TO TWO AFTER LOSING THE OPENING 
SESSION FIVE TO THREE A PRETTY GOOD 
PERFORMANCE 
JUST LOOKING AT THE BUNCH I AM NOT 
SURE IF THE TWO REDS NEAR THE PINK 
SPOT ARE AVAILABLE INTO THE LEFT 
CORNER 
THOSE REDS MUST GO HE HAS PLAYED 
IT WELL 
THAT LITTLE CANNON HAS HELD HIM ON 
THE PINK 
A PRETTY HIGH STANDARD IN THIS 
SESSION HIS POT SUCCESS RATE HAS 
GONE UP TO NINETY PER CENT JOE PERRY IS AT EIGHTY NINE PER CENT 
SO THEY REALLY HAVE IMPROVED ALI 
HAS HAD A CENTURY BREAK HE HAS HAD 
A FIFTY SIX SIXTY FOUR FIFTY ONE TWICE AND JOE PERRY 
HAS HAD ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN AND A FIFTY SEVEN 
THERE HAS 
BEEN A FIFTY BREAK IN EVERY FRAME 
EXCEPT ONE THIS AFTERNOON 
WELL EVERY CREDIT TO THESE TWO 
PLAYERS FIRST TIME AT THE CRUCIBLE 
THEATRE IN THE SEMI FINAL AND THEY 
HAVE PUT ON GOOD MATCH FOR US 
AND IT IS GOING TO GET MORE AND 
MORE INTERESTING WITH EACH FRAME 
A SIMPLE FRAME BALL FOR CARTER 
PERRY LEAD FIVE MINUS TWO BUT CARTER 
THROUGH WINNING THE LAST FRAME LAST 
EVENING AND THE FIRST FIVE THIS 
AFTERNOON WENT EIGHT TO FIVE UP 
CAN'T WAIT 
FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S SESSION 
CLIVE CAN JOE PERRY GET CARTER DO 
YOU THINK 
WELL HE HAS CERTAINLY GIVEN 
HIMSELF BETTER CHANCE BY REDUCING 
IT TO EIGHT TO SEVEN BUT HE IS GOING TO BE NINE 
SEVEN BEHIND RESUMING TOMORROW MORNING 
IF THE REDS GO HE CAN SLIP PAST 
THEM ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TABLE 
WELL HE COULD GET TO THEM FROM THE 
PINK SO OBVIOUSLY THEY POT THIS 
HAS BEEN A TERRIFIC EFFORT FROM ALI 
CARTER 
EIRIAN WILLIAMS HAVING TO RUN 
AROUND THE TABLE AT THE MOMENT THE 
WAY THAT ALI IS PLAYING 
CARTER'S SECOND CENTURY OF THE 
SESSION HE MADE ONE HUNDRED SIX TO GO SEVEN TO FIVE UP 
IN THE LAST FRAME JOE PERRY MADE A 
BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN IT IS AMAZING WHAT 
YOU CAN DO WHEN THE FRAME RESULT IS 
NO LONGER IN DOUBT 
BOOK THEM FOR 
AN EXHIBITION AND THAT IS THE SORT 
OF STUFF YOU WOULD SEE THAT WAS 
ANOTHER EXHIBITION SHOT 
SO ALI CARTER ENDS THE SESSION WITH 
A TOTAL CLEARANCE OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT AND LEADS 
JOE PERRY NINE TO SEVEN GOING INTO TOMORROW 
MORNING'S PENULTIMATE SESSION 
A FINE COMEBACK FROM ALI CARTER AND 
HE WILL RESUME AT TEN A M. IN THE 
MORNING 
WE WILL LEAVE YOU WITH A MORNING MAN WHO MUST HAVE MARVELLED AT 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN'S PERFORMANCE 
TODAY HIS FORMER COACH AND SIX 
TIMES WORLD CHAMPION RAY REARDON 
WHERE ARE YOU BABY BY 
BETTY BOO
