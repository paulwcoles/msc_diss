TONIGHT WE HAVE NOTHING SOME 
SUPPLIES ARE NOW GETTING THROUGH 
FOREIGN AID ARRIVING AT RANGOON 
AIRPORT TODAY BUT IT IS NOWHERE 
NEAR ENOUGH ON STATE TELEVISION 
BURMA'S AUTHORITARIAN RULERS ARE 
TRYING TO PROVE THEY HAVE THE 
SITUATION UNDER CONTROL BUT THE 
GENERALS ARE FAILING THIS INTO 
THIS ASSESSMENT FROM MY COLLEAGUE 
IN RANGOON A B. B. C. JOURNALIST HIS 
IDENTITY MUST BE KEPT SECRET FOR 
HIS OWN SAFETY 
THOUSANDS OF TREES

ISOLATED GOVERNMENT AND A WALL OF 
RED TAPE RIGHT NOW THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES ARE BLOCKING THE VISAS 
OF SOME FORTY KEY INTERNATIONAL AID 
WORKERS THE REGIME PLAYING 
POLITICS WHILE ITS PEOPLE ARE 
SUFFERING 
THEY WANT TO SHOW THAT SUFFERING THE ARMY IS THE ONLY INSTITUTION HE 
WAS TAKING CARE OF ITS PEOPLE IN 
BURMA SO THEY DO NOT WANT TO SHARE 
CREDIT TO ANY OTHER ORGANISATIONS 
TODAY A FEW MORE FAMILIES WERE 
PLUCKED FROM THE FLOODS SO ON BUT 
THIS DISASTER REQUIRES AN ARMADA OF 
BOATS AND AN ARMY OF MEDICAL TEAMS

TREATMENT FIVE DAYS AFTER THE 
CYCLONE STRUCK 
A GROUP OF BRITAIN'S LARGEST AID 
AGENCIES THE D. C. HAS LAUNCHED AN

CONCERNS THAT WITHOUT GREATER CO 
OPERATION FROM THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES AID WILL NOT BE 
DISTRIBUTED QUICKLY ENOUGH FOR 
THOSE WHO NEEDED MOST HERE IS 
BRIAN HANRAHAN 
SAVING THE SURVIVORS IS THE TASK 
NOW BUT THERE ARE THREE BURDENS 
THE COLOSSAL SCALE OF THE 
CATASTROPHE THE HUGE LOGISTICAL 
TASK OF REACHING THE REGION AND 
THE RELUCTANCE OF THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT TO ACCEPT HELP THE 
SATELLITE PHOTOS ARE STILL THE BEST 
ILLUSTRATION OF WHAT HAPPENED WHEN 
THE IRRAWADDY DELTA WAS STRUCK BY A 
CYCLONE DRIVING BEFORE IT A TWELVE F. T. 
WAVE AND INUNDATING TWO THOUSAND SQUARE 
MILES OF SALT WATER THERE IS NO 
REALISTIC CASUALTY COUNT BUT IT IS

DAYS WILL STILL BE VULNERABLE TO 
DISEASE PARTICULARLY FROM THE 
FLOODWATERS WHICH

BRIEFLY WHAT HAS THE 
REACTION BEEN FROM POLITICIANS THE THE HOME SECRETARY HAS SAID THAT SHE IS

THE JOSEF FRITZL THE AUSTRIAN MAN 
WHO IMPRISONED AND RAPED HIS 
DAUGHTER FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS TOLD HIS 
LAWYER THAT HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS LIKE 
AN ADDICTION HIS COMMENTS HAVE 
BEEN LEASED TO A LOCAL MAGAZINE HE 
CLAIMS HE WAS NOT THE BEAST 
DESCRIBED BY THE MEDIA BUT A MAN 
WHO TRIED HIS BEST TO CARE FOR HIS 
FAMILY IN THE CELLAR LUISA BALDINI 
REPORTS REPORTS AS THE HORRORS OF LIFE IN THE 
AMSTETTEN SALES SLOWLY EMERGE SO 
DO INDICATIONS OF JOSEF FRITZL'S 
WALKED STATE OF MIND HE HAS BROKEN 
HIS SILENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE BEING HELD IN CUSTODY AND 
REMARKS MADE TO HIS LAWYER ARE NOW 
IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN SEVENTY THREE AROUND 
FITS ALL SAID THAT DURING THE TWENTY FOUR 
YEARS IN PRISON TO HIS DAUGHTER HE 
CONSTANTLY KNEW THAT WHAT HE WAS 
DOING WAS NOT RIGHT HE CLAIMS HE 
MUST HAVE BEEN CRAZY AND IN ONE 
AND HE SAYS 
HE TOLD HIS LAWYER THAT IT BECAME A 
MATTER OF COURSE FOR HIM TO LEAD A 
SECOND LIFE IN THE BASEMENT OF HIS 
HOUSE AND HE CRITICISED MEDIA 
COVERAGE AS ONE SIDED SAYING HE 
DID TRY TO CARE FOR HIS SECRET 
FAMILY 
THE RETIRED ELECTRICIAN REMAINS IN 
CUSTODY BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN 
CHARGED HE IS DUE TO FACE 
PROSECUTORS IMMINENTLY HIS LAWYERS 
INDICATED THAT HE PLANS TO PLEAD 
INSANITY INSANITY IT IS SIX FIFTEEN P. M. THE HEADLINES THE 
FIRST UN AID FLIGHT ARRIVES IN 
BURMA BUT THERE ARE FEARS THE 
MILITARY GOVERNMENT COULD STOP IT 
FROM REACHING THE PEOPLE MOST IN 
NEED NEED COMING UP THE REAL LIFE BAND OF 
BROTHERS WE MEET THE MOTHER WHOSE 
THREE SONS AND HUSBAND ARE HEADING 
FOR IRAQ 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON THE NEW DRIVE 
TO TEACH CHILDREN AS LONG AS AS 
YOUNG AS FIVE ABOUT THE DANGERS OF 
BEING ONLINE 
HAVE YOU GOT THE RIGHT STUFF THE 
LONDONERS LINING UP TO BECOME 
BRITAIN'S NEXT ASTRONAUT 
POLICE FORCES IN ENGLAND AND WALES 
HAVE BEEN ASKED TO GIVE GANGS OF 
THUGS A TASTE OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE 
IT IS THE HOME SECRETARY'S LATEST 
IDEA TO TACKLE ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR 
JACQUI SMITH SAYS PEOPLE WHO 
HARASSED COMMUNITIES SHOULD 
THEMSELVES BE HARASSED IT COMES 
AMID THAT NEW FIGURES SHOW THAT 
ALMOST HALF OF ALL ANTISOCIAL 
BEHAVIOUR ORDERS HAVE ENDED UP 
BEING BREACHED CATHERINE MARSTON 
IS IN LEEDS 
IF YOU LIVE ON AN ESTATE LIKE THIS 
YOUR LIFE REALLY CAN BE BLIGHTED BY 
VIOLENCE AND CRIME IT IS ESTIMATED 
THAT ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR COSTS 
THIS COUNTRY OVER THREE BILLION A YEAR 
CAN A PLAN TO TURN THE TABLES ON 
THE TROUBLEMAKERS MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE HIS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND REALLY 
ENOUGH TO DO IT IS 
THEY PUT A 
FIREWORK THEY TRIED TO BLOW THE 
GATES OFF 
THIS ESTATE HOLDS 
TERRIBLE MEMORIES FOR JOANNE SHE 
AND HER CHILDREN WERE ATTACKED HERE 
AND HER HOME WAS TARGETED 
ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR MADE HER LIFE 
HELL SHE IS NOT CONVINCED GIVING 
TROUBLEMAKERS A TASTE OF THEIR OWN 
MEDICINE WOULD WORK 
THEY HAVE NO 
RESPECT FOR THEMSELVES SO THEY 
HAVE NO RESPECT FOR ANYBODY AROUND 
THEM AND FOR THE LAW THEY HAVE NO 
RESPECT THEY KNOW THE LAW BETTER 
THAN ADULTS 
THE IDEA TO TURN THE 
TABLES ON TROUBLEMAKERS COMES AS 
FIGURES SHOW THE PROPORTION OF 
PEOPLE REACHING THEIR ANTISOCIAL 
BEHAVIOUR ORDERS HAS GONE UP EVEN 
THOUGH THE NUMBER OF ASBOS ISSUED 
HAS FALLEN DRAMATICALLY THE HOME 
SECRETARY SAYS SHE WANTS TO GIVE 
TROUBLEMAKERS ON AN ESTATE LIKE 
THIS A TASTE OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE 
WITH DAILY VISITS FROM THE POLICE 
AND RELENTLESS FOALING OF OFFENDERS 
IT HAS BEEN TRIED OUT IN ESSEX AND 
SHE SAYS IT HAS PUT AN END TO SOME 
OTHER PROBLEMS 
THOSE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR HAVE NO 
ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE AND NOWHERE TO 
HIDE 
CHECKING FOR PROPER ROAD TAX HIDE OFFICERS ON THIS ESTATE ALREADY 
USED MANY OF THE TECHNIQUES 
SUGGESTED TODAY IN THIS AREA IT 
IS CERTAINLY WORKING CRIME IS DOWN 
SO AS ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR IT IT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT WE'RE DOING 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT IF THESE PEOPLE 
CONTINUE TO ROAM ABOUT THEY WILL 
BE FILMED THEY WILL BE 
PHOTOGRAPHED AND WE WILL BE IN 
THEIR FACES THEY WILL HAVE TO 
WATCH WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
SEVEN PER CENT OF 
PEOPLE CARRY ON OFFENDING EVEN 
AFTER THREE ENCOUNTERS WITH THE 
AUTHORITIES THE HOME SECRETARY 
SAYS IT IS THESE TYPE OF OFFENDERS 
WHO NEED TO KNOW THE POLICE ARE 
WATCHING WATCHING IN ESSEX THE POLICE CERTAINLY SAY 
THESE TACTICS HAVE HAD A DRAMATIC 
EFFECT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO 
STRESS THAT WHEN THIS HAS ROLLED 
OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT IS NOT 
ABOUT TARGETING YOUTHS WHO ARE 
HANGING AROUND ON THE STREETS IT 
IS MUCH MORE SPECIFIC IT WILL TRY 
TO REDUCE VEHICLE CRIME BURGLARY 
AND VIOLENCE CERTAINLY IN ESSEX 
THESE TACTICS HAVE TURNED UP DONE 
JUST THAT 
HOW MUCH FOOD DO YOU THROW AWAY 
UNTOUCHED AND UNEATEN RESEARCH 
SHOWS WE ARE THROWING AWAY TEN 
BILLION WORTH OF EDIBLE FOOD EVERY 
YEAR MUCH OF IT IS BEFORE THE 
SELL BY DATE 
IF YOU WANT CONFIRMATION THAT IT IS 
A THROWAWAY SOCIETY LOOK CLOSE TO 
HOME TRY THE KITCHEN WE ARE 
WASTING MILLIONS OF TONS OF FOOD 
EVERY YEAR WE ARE PICKING IT FROM 
OUR FRIDGES AND CUPBOARDS PAST ITS 
BEST BEFORE DATE MOULDY AND 
UNAPPETISING WE ARE BUYING TOO 
MUCH FOOD 
THERE IS FEARED THAT YOU 
THINK YOU NEED IT OR YOUR EYES ARE 
BIGGER THAN YOUR STOMACH YOU BUY 
THINGS AND FORGET YOU HAVE THEM 
CADENZA BEING PASSED ITS SELL BY 
DATE 
HOW MUCH FOOD TO BE THROWN DATE AWAY EACH YEAR THEY SHOULD DO WE 
THROW AWAY 
IN CITIES INCLUDING BRISTOL THEY 
ARE AT LEAST TRYING TO GET SOME 
BENEFIT OUT OF DISCARDED FOOD IT 
GOES INTO SEPARATE BINS TAKEN AWAY 
TO MAKE COMPOST ON AN INDUSTRIAL 
SCALE LOOKING AT IT IT IS EASY TO 
BELIEVE WE THROW AWAY A STAGGERING 
AMOUNT OF FOOD EVERY DAY THIS IS 
AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE TOLD THERE IS 
A GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS WITH FOOD 
SHORTAGES IN COUNTRIES RIGHT AROUND 
THE WORLD 
FOR MOST OF US IT SEEMS WE AGREE 
NOW THAT THE SITUATION IS SIMPLY 
UNACCEPTABLE 
WE LEARN TOO MUCH UNACCEPTABLE MONEY AND WE CAN WASTE SO MUCH THAT 
COULD BE USED SO MORALES WE EARN 
ANOTHER PLACE WHERE THEY 
DESPERATELY NEED IT 
SOMETIMES IT 
ENDS UP IN THE FREEZER BECAUSE IT 
HAS NOT BEEN USED L. HAVE TO THROW 
IT AWAY A MAKES ME FEEL SICK THAT 
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TO ME 
BACK IT MAKES ME 
WE SPENT TOO 
MUCH MONEY ON THE PACKET FOOD AND 
FROZEN MEALS ALL THAT SORT OF 
THING IT IS A WASTE 
TO CUT THE 
MOUNTAIN OF FOOD WE THROW AWAY WE 
MUST ALL BY LESS AND BUY MORE 
CAREFULLY THESE DAYS OF THE WEEKLY 
SUPERMARKET SHOP IT MEANS IT WILL 
NOT BE EASY TO ACHIEVE IT 
SIXTY YEARS AGO TODAY ISRAEL WAS 
FOUNDED IT BECAME AN INDEPENDENT 
STATE THREE YEARS AFTER THE END OF 
WORLD WAR TWO AND FOLLOWING THE 
DEATHS OF SIX MILLION JEWS IN THE 
HOLOCAUST ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN 
MARKING THE ANNIVERSARY WITH 
CELEBRATIONS INCLUDING CONCERTS 
AND AN AERIAL DISPLAY JEREMY BOWEN 
IS IN JERUSALEM FOR MANY PEOPLE 
IT MUST BE A BITTERSWEET MOMENT 
SIXTY YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE BUT NOT 
NECESSARILY ALL OF IT WITH THE 
PEACE THEY DREAMED OF 
NO BUT 
ISRAEL HAS ACHIEVED MANY THINGS A 
PRODIGIOUS FEAT OF NATION BUILDING 
A HI TECH ECONOMY VERY STRONG 
ARMED FORCES THE THING THAT 
MATTERS ABOUT NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT THE CONNECTION 
GOING ON HERE IS THAT THE THREE 
BIG ISSUES WHICH WERE ON THE TABLE 
AND THE CURRENT NEGOTIATIONS BY 
WHICH I MEAN THE FUTURE OF 
JERUSALEM THE EXISTENCE OF A 
PALESTINIAN STATE ALONGSIDE ISRAEL 
AND THE FUTURE OF PALESTINIAN 
REFUGEES ALL OF THAT 
FUNDAMENTALLY DATES BACK TO NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT 
THOSE ISSUES MANY OF THEM WERE 
SHAPED THEM THERE IS A DIRECT 
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE EVENTS OF SIXTY 
YEARS AGO ON THE PROBLEMS OF TODAY 
WE OFTEN THINK OF THE REGION AROUND 
ISRAEL AS REGION OF CONFLICT 
WE'RE JUST GETTING THIS AFTERNOON 
REPORTS THAT THERE IS FIGHTING IN 
NEIGHBOURING LEBANON IN BEIRUT 
YES THERE IS A VERY CONCERNING 
VERY SERIOUS SITUATION UNFOLDING IN 
BEIRUT AT THIS VERY MOMENT THERE 
HAS BEEN A LONG RUNNING POLITICAL 
STAND OFF THERE THEY HAVE NOT 
MANAGED TO GET A PRESIDENT THE 
COUNTRY HAS BEEN SPLIT DOWN THE 
MIDDLE AT THE MOMENT WHAT WE ARE 
SEEING OF GUN BATTLES ON THE 
STREETS OF BEIRUT THE LEADER OF 
THE GOVERNING PARTY HAS JUST BEEN 
ON THE TELEVISION HE HAS ONLY JUST 
FINISHED NOW SAYING THAT 
CALLING ON THE LEADER OF HEZBOLLAH 
TO STOP USING THE LANGUAGE OF CIVIL 
WAR TAKE HIS MEN OFF THE STREETS 
I DO NOT THINK IT COULD BE LOOKING 
MORE SERIOUS THAN IT IS TONIGHT IT 
IS THE KIND OF NIGHTMARE SCENARIO 
UNFOLDING MANY PEOPLE FEAR THAT IT 
HAS BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR A WHILE 
HAVING SAID THAT MEDIATION IS 
SOMETHING THAT THE SCENES IN BEIRUT 
TONIGHT MIGHT THE MEDIATION 
MIGHT BE ENCOURAGED BY THOSE SCENES 
IN BEIRUT MAYBE THE IRANIANS AND 
THE SAUDIS WILL GET TOGETHER TO TRY 
TO STOP THIS 
SENDING ONE SON INTO CONFLICT IS 
BAD ENOUGH IMAGINE SENDING THREE 
SONS AND YOUR HUSBAND THAT IS WHAT 
IS HAPPENING TO WENDY MACKNESS 
WHOSE ENTIRE FAMILY IS OFF TO SERVE 
IN IRAQ GRAHAM SATCHELL REPORTS ON
