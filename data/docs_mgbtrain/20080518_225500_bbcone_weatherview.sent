HELLO A GOOD NIGHT FOR ASTRONOMERS BUT NOT FOR FARMERS AND GARDENERS 
TEMPERATURES TAKING A DIVE UNDERNEATH CLEAR SKIES 
AND THOSE TEMPERATURES GOING TO BE QUITE LOW BY DAWN IN THE MORNING 
THE CLOUD FOLLOWED A FAMILIAR PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
SPREADING OUT FOR A TIME THEN STARTING TO MELT AWAY 
THROUGH THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT AS THOSE TEMPERATURES FELL 
FAIRLY CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE U. K. FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT 
SLIGHT WINDS AND TEMPERATURES DOWN CLOSE TO FREEZING IN MANY PLACES 
THESE ARE THE TEMPERATURES IN THE TOWNS AND CITIES 
KNOCK A FEW DEGREES OFF IN RURAL SPOTS AND FROST FROM M. FOUR NORTHWARDS 
A BRIGHT SUNNY START TO THE DAY ON MONDAY ACROSS MUCH OF WALES 
A BIT OF CLOUD DRIFTING ACROSS THE IRISH SEA 
A BIT OF A CHILL IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND 
SOME CLOUD ACROSS THE HIGHLANDS MAYBE THE ODD SHOWER HERE AND THERE 
BUT FEW AND FAR BETWEEN 
ACROSS THE NORTH AND INTO THE MIDLANDS YOU'LL SEE THE SUNSHINE 
OUT THE WINDOW BUT OUTSIDE YOU'LL CERTAINLY NOTICE THE CHILL 
WON'T FEEL MUCH LIKE A SPRING MORNING OR EVEN EARLY SUMMER 
A BREEZE BLOWING IN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN COAST THROUGH THE DAY 
BUT A PRETTY CHEERY START I THINK IN THOSE AREAS 
BUT A BIT OF A CHILL FIRST THING 
WE'LL FOLLOW THE SAME SORT OF PATTERN AS TEMPERATURES RISE 
THOUGH THE MORNING AND WE SEE THAT CLOUD DEVELOPING INTO THE AFTERNOON 
THE CLOUD SPREADING OUT ONCE AGAIN 
MIGHT BE THICK ENOUGH FOR THE ODD SHOWER 
NOT MANY OF THOSE IN NORTHERN ENGLAND THE SAME AS SUNDAY 
FIFTEEN DEGREES NEARER TWELVE TO FOURTEEN ON THE EAST COAST WITH A NORTH SEA BREEZE 
NOT A STRONG BREEZE BUT ENOUGH TO INFLUENCE THE TEMPERATURES 
ACROSS THE HIGHLANDS THE ODD SHOWER IN THE MOUNTAINS 
YOU MIGHT SEE ONE IN NORTHERN IRELAND BUT MOST PLACES 
WILL STAY DRY AS IN WALES WHERE THERE'LL BE GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE 
ALONG WITH THE SOUTH WEST 
STILL THAT NAGGING BREEZE FROM THE EAST 
SO IF YOU'RE EXPOSED TO THAT BREEZE ON THE COAST IT WILL FEEL COOL 
PROBABLY MORE CLOUD DEVELOPING IN LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST 
BUT KENT AND SUSSEX COULD GET A VERY SUNNY DAY 
THE SKIES CLEAR AGAIN THOUGH MONDAY NIGHT SO SAME STORY REALLY 
TEMPERATURES DROP AWAY A BIT OF FROST HERE AND THERE 
COVER UP THOSE TENDER PLANTS 
BUT THE SUN SOON GETS GOING SO A FINE DAY VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE 
ON TUESDAY SOME PATCHY CLOUDS TEMPERATURES PRETTY SIMILAR 
INTO THE MID TEENS IN THE WARMER SPOTS 
A TREND TO SOMETHING WARMER STILL AS THE WEEK GOES ON 
BY THURSDAY ONE OR TWO SHOWERY OUTBREAKS IN THE WEST OF THE U. K. 
IN LONDON FOR EXAMPLE TEMPERATURES AS HIGH AS TWENTY DEGREES BY THURSDAY 
IT WILL START TO FEEL A LITTLE MORE LIKE SUMMER ONCE AGAIN BYE BYE
