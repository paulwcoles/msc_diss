YOU CAN WORK IT OUT IF YOU JUST LEARN ABOUT 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN RIDE 
OR BUMP AND JUMP GLIDE AND SLIDE 
TAKE A LITTLE LOOK INSIDE THE WAY THINGS WORK 
AND WATCH THE THINGAMABOB THAT TURNS THE KNOB 
THAT MAKES THE JIGGER JIG 
THAT TURNS THE THINGAMAJIG THAT PULLS THE TRIGGER 
THAT MAKES THE DIGGER DIG 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN FLY 
WITHOUT A WING OR STRING TO TIE WITH 
YOU FIND THE SAME RULES APPLY WITH 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
IT WAS TIME FOR THE ANNUAL MAMMOTH ISLAND FAIR 
AND OLIVE DETERMINED THAT THIS YEAR IT SHOULD BE A SUCCESS 
O. K. TROY WHAT DO WE DO TO MAKE IT BETTER 
I'VE THOUGHT HARD ABOUT THIS AND I THINK I'VE GOT A PLAN WHICH IS 
GUESS HOW MUCH A COCONUT WEIGHS 
FANTASTIC GENIUS FANTASTIC MATE 
I DON'T MEAN TO BE UNKIND BUT THAT IS SO BORING 
OLIVE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE THE FAIR WORK 
LAST YEAR NO ONE WOULD COME BECAUSE IT WAS SO BORING 
RIGHT NOW WHAT HAVE WE GOT 
DAD WHAT'S THIS SIT THERE AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS 
LOOK IT'S A SWING IT GOES ROUND AND ROUND A POLE IT'S GREAT 
OH DAD THAT'S SO BORING COME ON OLIVE YOU CAN'T EXPECT TOO MUCH 
RIGHT WHAT'S YOUR IDEA UNCLE PILLBEAN O. K. TRY THIS 
IT'S A ROUNDABOUT IT GOES ROUND AND ROUND SEE 
YOU CAN GET LOTS OF PEOPLE ON IT WELL YES 
STILL NOT TOTALLY EXCITING IS IT 
WHEE 
EXCEPT FOR AUNTIE 
O. K. TROY SAVE THE DAY 
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF THIS IS THE BIG ONE LOOK 
SNAIL RACING 
YEAH THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST THING EVER 
H. M. M. 
OR MAYBE NOT 
COME ON YOU LOT GOT TO HAVE A GOOD IDEA 
EVEN A HALF GOOD IDEA WOULD BE A START 
WHEE 
NO WAIT A MINUTE I KNOW WHY DON'T WE COMBINE THE SWING 
AND THE ROUNDABOUT WE MAKE A ROUNDABOUT WITH SWINGS 
YEAH YEAH 
WHAT A GREAT IDEA OLIVE 
O. K. LET'S GO FOR IT ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS BUILD IT 
OH YEAH ALWAYS A CATCH 
HUH 
BRENDA MAKING A BIG SALAD FOR THE FAIR ARE YOU ARGH 
O. I. LOOK OUT YOU INVENTOR PERSON 
YES BUT IT TAKES AGES TO CLEAN ALL THIS FILTHY LETTUCE 
AH H. M. M. YES 
SO I SEE H. M. M. 
WHAT YOU NEED IS A MACHINE THAT DOES THIS FOR YOU A MACHINE 
I DON'T THINK SO 
I DON'T WANT ANY NEW FANGLED STUFF IN MY KITCHEN THANK YOU 
BUT BRENDA IT COULD SAVE YOU SO MUCH WORK LOOK 
YES HERE WE GO ALL THE LETTUCE GOES IN HERE YOU SEE 
THEN THE HANDLE IS TURNED AND BY USING A SERIES OF GEARS 
IT ROTATES THE BOWL AT SPEED 
SENDING ALL THE WATER OUTSIDE BY CENTRIFUGAL FORCE 
THE SALAD SPINNER USES A SYSTEM OF GEARS 
IN WHICH THE OUTER GEARING TURNS THIS INNER GEAR 
THAT DRIVES THIS SMALL CENTRAL ONE COVERTING THE HANDLE ROTATION 
INTO A HIGH TURNING SPEED FOR THE SALAD BOWL AND THE LETTUCE IS DRY 
OH OH WHEE 
I SHOWED AUNT BRENDA MY SALAD DRYER IDEA BUT SHE WASN'T INTERESTED 
THAT'S HER PROBLEM WOULDN'T THIS IDEA BE GOOD FOR A MERRY GO ROUND 
GREAT OLIVE COULD BE LOTS OF FUN 
IT MAY BE FUN FOR YOU BUT HARD WORK FOR ME 
ALL RIGHT TROY YOU CAN STOP NOW I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA 
OH NO WE'LL NEVER GET THIS RIGHT 
THANKS OLIVE DON'T WORRY UNCLE WE'LL GET IT GOING FASTER 
WE'RE GOING TO USE GEARS HOW 
WHAT OLIVE HAD WORKED OUT WAS A GEAR IS A WHEEL 
THAT WHEN CONNECTED TO ANOTHER PUSHES THE OTHER WHEEL AROUND 
THE BIGGER THE DIFFERENCES IN THE SIZES OF THE TWO WHEELS 
THE BIGGER THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR RELATIVE SPEEDS 
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT GEARS FROM BEVEL GEARS 
WHERE WHEELS CONNECT AT AN ANGLE TO CHANGE DIRECTION OF ROTATION 
TO WORM GEARS A SCREW THREADED SHAFT MESHES WITH A TOOTHED WHEEL 
TO THE DIRECTION OF MOTION TO RACK AND PINION GEARS 
WHERE ONE WHEEL THE PINION MESHES WITH A SLIDING TOOTHED RACK 
CONVERTING CIRCULAR MOTION TO TO AND FRO MOTION AND VICE VERSA 
TO SIMPLE SPUR GEARS WHERE TWO GEARS CONNECT ON THE SAME PLANE 
REVERSING THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT AND REGULATING ITS FORCE OR SPEED 
GEARS ARE USED IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS 
ON BICYCLES 
TO WIND CAR WINDOWS UP AND DOWN 
EVEN TO WORK A LAWN SPRINKLER 
THAT'S ONE WAY TO MAKE IT WORK WE TRIED PUSHING IT OURSELVES 
BUT IT TOOK SO MANY OF US 
NO ONE COULD RIDE SO THE MAMMOTHS DID IT 
FINE BUT WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO DO THIS WE GIVE THEM CARROTS 
AND THE MORE CARROTS THEY GET THE FASTER THEY RUN OH URGH 
H. M. M. WELL IT'S COOLER THAN SLUG RACING 
BUT I THINK IT'S A BIT FAST FOR THE LITTLE ONES UGH AND THE OLD ONES 
WHY DON'T WE SWAP THE WHEELS AROUND 
SO THE LITTLE ONE POWERS THE BIG ONE H. M. M. MIGHT BE WORTH A TRY 
THIS SHOULD BE FUN LET'S SEE 
O. K. I'M READY GIVE THEM A CARROT DAD 
THIS IS BORING 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TROY IT'S O. K. FOR LITTLE KIDS AND AUNTIES 
BUT REALLY BORING FOR ANYONE ELSE 
THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY 
THAT SMELLS NICE BRENDA 
ARGH YOU MIGHT BE MR. CLEVER INVENTOR 
BUT YOU CAN STILL KEEP YOUR FINGERS OUT OF MY CAKE MIX OH PLEASE 
JUST A LITTLE TASTE NO NOW INSTEAD OF HELPING YOURSELF 
HELP ME MIX THIS ALL UP 
YOU KNOW PERHAPS I COULD HELP NOT MORE NEW FANGLED MACHINES 
YES BRENDA THE EGG WHISK USES THE PRINCIPLES OF THESE GEARS 
WHICH ARE CALLED BEVEL GEARS 
AS THE HANDLE IS TURNED IT TURNS THIS CROWN WHEEL 
WHICH TURN THESE BEVEL PINIONS 
WHICH BECAUSE THEY MESH WITH THE OPPOSITE FACES OF THE CROWN WHEEL 
ROTATE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS 
THIS MEANS THE BEATERS MIX UP THE CAKE MIXTURE MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY 
AS IT GOES THROUGH THE BLADES IN TWO DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME 
M. M. M. M. M. M. EXCELLENT 
I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE MY CAKE MIX ALONE 
OF COURSE WHAT YOU NEED IS A BIG GEAR BOX 
TO MAKE YOUR MERRY GO ROUND WORK WE DON'T HAVE TO TIME TO BUILD ONE 
WHAT A LATHE GOT SOME REALLY BIG TOOLS TO SHARPEN HAVE YOU OLIVE 
NO LOOK AT THE BELT IT'S USING 
WE COULD USE BELTS INSTEAD OF GEARS THAT COULD WORK 
BUT WE DO HAVE TIME TO MAKE A BIG ONE OF THOSE 
COME ON 
HERE WE GO 
DAD THE CARROTS WE'VE RUN OUT OLIVE 
NO HOW ARE WE GOING TO DRIVE THE MERRY GO ROUND WITHOUT MAMMOTHS 
WE COULD ALL PUSH IT YES BUT THEN NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO RIDE ON IT 
OH RIGHT 
PROBLEMS OLIVE YES WE'VE GOT NO CARROTS LEFT 
SO THE MAMMOTHS HAVE GONE ON STRIKE OH DEAR 
SHAME YOU HAVEN'T GOT A REALLY BIG BICYCLE 
ATTACH A BELT TO THE BACK WHEEL AND YOU CAN SPIN THE MERRY GO ROUND 
BY PEDAL POWER AN ORDINARY BICYCLE WOULDN'T PRODUCE ENOUGH POWER 
WAIT A MINUTE YES IT COULD TROY 
WHY ME OLIVE BECAUSE YOU'RE SO KIND AND STRONG 
AND TALENTED AND YES YES YES ALL RIGHT 
SO FINALLY THE FAIR IS A HUGE SUCCESS 
YES THANKS TO BELTS GEARS AND CAKE CAKE 
YOU CAN'T DRIVE OUR MERRY GO ROUND WITHOUT CAKE 
BUT MAMMOTHS HATE CAKE 
I KNOW BUT TROY DOESN'T 
THANKS AUNTIE BRENDA 
OH 
JOURNALISM 
A HEAD TEACHER WAS NEARLY TRAMPLED TO DEATH 
IN THE PANIC YESTERDAY 
WHEN A SWARM OF DEADLY BEES INVADED A SCHOOL 
PETER JONES TWENTY SEVEN COLLAPSED TO THE GROUND 
AS HIS COLLEAGUES AT HIGHFIELD JUNIOR SCHOOL BROMLEY FLED 
AT LEAST SIX PUPILS WERE TAKEN TO HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT 
AFTER BEING STUNG BY THE BEES 
LATER THE BEES WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE SPECIES BOMBUS HORRILIBIS 
WHICH CAN KILL ON OCCASIONS BUT LUCKILY THE STINGS WERE TOO PREMATURE TO DO MUCH HARM 
IN A MUFFLED VOICE BECAUSE OF HIS BANDAGES MR. JONES HAD THIS TO SAY 
IT WAS A VERY NARROW ESCAPE FOR EVERYONE ESPECIALLY FOR ME 
BECAUSE MOST OF THE TEACHERS HAD STILETTO HEELS ON 
IT WAS NOON WHEN THE FIRST BEE WAS SPOTTED BY PUPIL CAMERON SANDERS EIGHT 
HE HAD WALKED INTO THE TOILET TO WASH HIS HANDS WHEN HE NOTICED 
THE INSECT FLYING AROUND HE CARRIED ON WASHING HIS HANDS 
CAMERON WALKED OVER TO THE DRYER AND STARTED TO DRY HIS HANDS 
IT WAS THEN THAT SOMETHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY HAPPENED 
HUNDREDS OF BEES STARTED FLYING OUT OF THE DRYER OLIVER 
MASTER SANDERS BOLTED OUT OF THE TOILET AND SLAMMED THE DOOR 
BEFORE NOTICING THE INSECTS SQUEEZING THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
CAMERON RUSHED OFF TO THE STAFFROOM AND BEAT UPON THE DOOR 
IT WAS OPENED BY MISS BUDDY YEAR FIVE TEACHER 
THE BASIC PRINCIPLES TO FOLLOW WHEN WRITING A PIECE OF JOURNALISM 
IS TO GET OVER THE MAIN PIECES OF INFORMATION 
WHAT HAPPENED WHERE IT HAPPENED WHY IT HAPPENED WHO IT HAPPENED TO AND HOW IT HAPPENED 
MR. JONES WHO HAD JUST COME BACK FROM A MEETING 
OPENED THE DOOR UNTO CHAOS 
THE TEACHERS RUSHED OUT OVER HIM 
AS I'M THE EDITOR I PULLED THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER 
I LOOKED AT THE BITS WHICH DIDN'T QUITE WORK 
AND TOOK THEM OUT AND DISCUSSED WITH THE REPORTERS WHETHER I THOUGHT IT 
WOULD WORK OR NOT AND WHETHER THEY COULD GET AN ADDITIONAL REPORT IN 
THIS IS LAURENCE SANDERS FOR HIGHFIELD SCHOOL NEWS
