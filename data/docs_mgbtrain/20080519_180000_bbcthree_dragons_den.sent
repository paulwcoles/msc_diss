I'VE GOT TO SAY I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS 
YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF COMPLETELY UN INVESTIBLE 
YOU'VE GOT A PATENT WORLDWIDE I ASSUME NO EH 
I THINK THERE MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE TO INVEST IN THIS 
THE DRAGONS HAVE ALL IT TAKES TO BE SUCCESSFUL 
FIVE OF BRITAIN'S MOST ENTERPRISING AND WEALTHY BUSINESS PEOPLE 
THEY'VE ALL BUILT UP THEIR OWN FORTUNES FROM SCRATCH 
JAMES CAAN MADE MILLIONS BUILDING A GLOBAL BUSINESS IN THE RECRUITMENT INDUSTRY 
AND HE NOW HEADS AN INTERNATIONAL PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM 
THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION BUSINESS EMPIRE OF GLASWEGIAN ENTREPRENEUR 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE INCLUDES HOTELS CASINOS AND HEALTH CLUBS 
DEBORAH MEADEN EARNED HER FORTUNE IN THE HOLIDAY AND LEISURE INDUSTRY IN THE WEST COUNTRY 
THEO PAPHITIS IS A RETAIL MAGNATE WHO'S TRANSFORMED THE FORTUNES 
OF HIGH STREET BRANDS LIKE RYMAN LA SENZA PARTNERS AND CONTESSA 
AND ONE OF BRITAIN'S BEST KNOWN ENTREPRENEURS PETER JONES 
HAS BUILT UP A MULTI MILLION POUND EMPIRE WITH A BUSINESS PORTFOLIO 
THAT RANGES FROM TELECOMS AND LEISURE TO PROPERTY AND MEDIA 
IN THE DEN THE DRAGONS ARE READY TO BACK THE RIGHT BUSINESSES 
WITH THEIR OWN MONEY BUT TONIGHT WILL ANYONE CONVINCE THEM TO INVEST 
WELCOME TO THE DRAGON'S DEN 
EVERY ENTREPRENEUR WHO COMES HERE IS CONVINCED THEIR IDEA OR INVENTION COULD MAKE THEM RICH 
BUT EACH OF THEM NEEDS A CASH INJECTION TO GET THEIR BUSINESS GOING 
OUR DRAGONS CAN PROVIDE THE BACKING THEY NEED 
BUT IT'S THEIR OWN MONEY THEY'RE USING SO EXPECT THEM TO ASK SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS 
CLAIRE SAGAR AND GILL KIRTLAND ARE FIRST INTO THE DEN LOOKING FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
MY NAME IS GILL KIRTLAND AND MY NAME IS CLAIRE SAGAR 
AND WE'RE HERE TODAY TO INTRODUCE TINGOTANG AND ASK 
FOR AN INVESTMENT OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR A TWENTY PER CENT SHARE 
IN OUR BUSINESS LOOKING FOR LOVE IS BIG BUSINESS IN THE U. K. 
BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TEN IT IS ESTIMATED THAT FORTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE U. K.'S ADULT POPULATION WILL BE SINGLE 
TODAY SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF SINGLETONS ARE ACTIVELY DATING 
SPENDING A WHOPPING EIGHT BILLION PER YEAR IN THEIR SEARCH FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL 
SO TINGOTANG WAS BORN TO PROVIDE UNIQUE AND DISTINCTIVE SYMBOLS 
FOR SINGLE PEOPLE JUST AS WEARING A WEDDING RING CAN SHOW YOU'RE IN A PARTNERSHIP 
NOW YOU CAN WEAR A TINGOTANG TO REVEAL YOUR SINGLE STATUS 
THERE'S A MALE SYMBOL FOR THE GUYS AND THIS IS THE FEMALE VERSION 
TINGOTANG HAS BEEN MADE INTO A RANGE OF JEWELLERY AND ACCESSORIES 
FOR PEOPLE TO WEAR TO SUIT THEIR OWN SINGLE LIFESTYLE 
ULTIMATELY WE WANT TINGOTANG TO BECOME THE RECOGNISED SYMBOL FOR SINGLE PEOPLE EVERYWHERE 
WE DO HAVE SAMPLES HERE TO SHOW YOU 
I'M WEARING THE FEMALE CHARM AS A PENDANT 
BUT IT CAN ALSO BE WORN ON A HANDBAG OR A LAPTOP CASE 
ANYWHERE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE TO WEAR THAT 
WE DO A SMALLER CHARM WHICH IS SUITABLE 
FOR A MOBILE PHONE OR TO GO ON A BRACELET 
AND WE ALSO DO A PIN BADGE WHICH LOOKS GREAT ON YOUR JEANS 
AND FOR GUYS WE HAVE THE KEYRING SHOWING THE MALE SYMBOL AND WE ALSO 
HAVE CUFFLINKS AND A PIN BADGE AS WELL 
WEST YORKSHIRE BASED DUO GILL KIRTLAND AND CLAIRE SAGAR 
NEED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO MARKET THEIR TINGOTANG SINGLE STATUS ACCESSORIES 
THEY'RE OFFERING TWENTY PER CENT OF THE BUSINESS IN RETURN 
THE PAIR ARE ADAMANT THE RANGE WILL CATCH ON WITH ANYONE 
LOOKING FOR LOVE BUT DEBORAH MEADEN ISN'T LOOKING SO SURE 
HELLO IS IT GILL CLAIRE 
THAT'S RIGHT YES I'M DEBORAH SO JUST TO MAKE SURE I GET THIS RIGHT 
THIS IS THE ALTERNATIVE TO STAMPING SINGLE ACROSS YOUR FOREHEAD 
IT'S A MUCH MORE STYLISH AND SUBTLE WAY OF SAYING 
I'M SINGLE AND HAPPY TO MAKE NEW CONNECTIONS 
O. K. I HAVE TO TELL YOU I DON'T LIKE IT IMMEDIATELY 
SO CAN YOU NOW TELL ME GIVE ME SOME NUMBERS 
THAT MIGHT CONVINCE ME THAT ACTUALLY I'M WRONG AND THERE'S A MARKET HERE 
WELL THE MEDIA RELATIONS THAT WE DID TO START DEFINITELY SEEMS 
TO BE THE ROUTE THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE TO GET BRAND AWARENESS 
THAT'S WORDS WHAT I'M AFTER IS NUMBERS SO YOUR INITIAL BURST PRODUCED A TURNOVER OF 
IT WAS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED O. K. 
SO THAT DOESN'T EXCITE ME AT ALL SO GIVE ME SOME MORE NUMBERS NOW THAT REALLY MAKE ME INTERESTED 
WE'VE ACTUALLY FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON GIVING THE PRODUCT AWAY TO PEOPLE 
DURING SORT OF CLUB NIGHTS TO TRY AND CREATE BRAND AWARENESS 
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE WE'VE FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON GIVING THE PRODUCT AWAY 
IT WAS TO CREATE BRAND AWARENESS AND INTEREST IN THE BRAND 
I STARTED OFF BY SAYING I HATE THE IDEA AND I COULD IMAGINE 
OTHER PEOPLE WOULDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF WEARING A BIG I'M SINGLE STAMPED ACROSS THEM 
IT'S A LESS THAN PROMISING START AS THE DUO FEEL THE FULL FORCE OF DEBORAH MEADEN'S DISPLEASURE 
AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S ABOUT TO GET WORSE 
I'VE GOT TO SAY I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS 
IT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING TO WALK IN AND WEAR A CHAIN THAT EVERYONE RECOGNISES AS I'M SINGLE 
IT'D BE EMBARRASSING IT'S NOT PEOPLE WOULD SAY YOU POOR SAD PERSON 
NO I DON'T THINK IT'S SAD THE IDEA COMES ABOUT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE 
I WAS STANDING IN A WINE BAR WITH A GROUP OF FOUR GIRLFRIENDS 
OF THE GROUP THERE I WAS THE ONLY SINGLE GIRL 
NEARBY WERE GROUPS OF GUYS AND SO ON WHO WERE YOU KNOW TALKING AND LOOKING OVER 
AND WE'RE LOOKING OVER AT THEM AND ONE OF THE GIRLS SAID TO ME 
IT MUST BE GREAT WHEN YOU'RE OUT PEOPLE MUST COME OVER AND SAY 
NICE TO MEET YOU AND HAVE A LITTLE CHAT FOR FIVE MINUTES 
AND I SAID YOU KNOW IT NEVER EVER HAPPENS 
THEY SAID WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS AND I SAID COS HOW DO THEY KNOW I'M SINGLE 
YOU'RE TRYING TO LABEL INDIVIDUALS THAT ACTUALLY DON'T WANT TO BE LABELLED 
AND IT'S THE REASON WHY PEOPLE JOIN DISCREET DATING SITES SO THAT EXACTLY THAT CAN HAPPEN 
THEY MEET LIKE MINDED PEOPLE THROUGH A STRUCTURED AND ORGANISED EVENT 
SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M OUT O. K. THANK YOU 
LOSING A DRAGON THIS EARLY IS A DISASTER FOR A PITCH 
WILL THE PAIR FARE ANY BETTER WITH JAMES CAAN 
I'M JAMES NICE TO MEET YOU HELLO 
THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN TO ME HOW YOU'RE GONNA SPEND THAT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PREDOMINANTLY MARKETING 
WE WANT TO GET INTO NATIONAL GLOSSIES AND INTO THE NEWSPAPERS ABOUT THE PRODUCT 
TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND HOW DO YOU DO THAT WE'RE TAKING ON A P. R. AGENCY TO DO THAT FOR US 
AND WHAT WOULD THAT P. R. AGENCY CHARGE YOU WE COULD SET THEM A BUDGET WE'VE SET THEM A BUDGET 
WE'VE GIVEN THEM A FOUR MONTH PROJECT AND WE'LL PAY THEM THIRTEEN THOUSAND TO DO THAT 
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA ACHIEVE IN THAT FOUR MONTHS 
HOPEFULLY SOME NATIONAL EXPOSURE FOR US 
BECAUSE I THINK I'M NOT QUITE SOLD ON THE IDEA ITSELF BECAUSE I THINK 
I READ THAT MORE AS THOUGH I'M UP FOR IT RATHER THAN I'M SINGLE 
AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE 
BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU'RE IN PUBS AND CLUBS ETC 
AND SOMEBODY'S HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK AND YOU'VE GOT THIS BIG STATEMENT 
SAYING I'M SINGLE AND I'M UP FOR IT 
THERE ARE A LOT OF SINGLE PEOPLE IN THE U. K. 
A LOT OF THEM ARE LOOKING TO CONNECT WITH OTHERS BUT AT THE MOMENT THEY HAVE NO SIGNAL 
BY WHICH TO START THAT AND THIS IS ENABLING THEM TO START THAT CONNECTION WITH EACH OTHER 
GILL AND CLAIRE ARE BATTLING ON BUT THEIR EFFORTS ARE BEING UNDERMINED 
BY THE ADVERSE REACTION THE DRAGONS HAVE HAD TO THEIR BASIC IDEA 
WILL THEO PAPHITIS SEE ANY POTENTIAL IN THE BUSINESS 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A LONG TERM PRODUCT 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A LONG TERM BUSINESS AND I DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN PROTECT IT 
I THINK IT'S EASILY COPIABLE IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT EVEN 
IF THEY ONLY TAKE PART OF THE MARKET IT FRAGMENTS 
AND FOR THOSE REASONS I'M AFRAID I WON'T BE INVESTING AND I'M OUT O. K. 
TWO DRAGONS OUT GILL AND CLAIRE'S PITCH IS COLLAPSING AROUND THEM 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE HASN'T SAID A WORD SO FAR NOW HE'S READY TO BREAK HIS SILENCE 
I THINK THAT THE BEST PLACE FOR YOU TO START 
IS BY GIVING UP THIS RIDICULOUS IDEA 
RIGHT IT REALLY IS IT'S LUDICROUS TO THINK YOU CAN MAKE MONEY IT MAY BE A BIT OF FUN 
BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO'LL WEAR THEM 
A LOT OF SINGLE PEOPLE THEY DON'T WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE SAD AND SINGLE 
THEY'RE SINGLE BUT AS SOON AS YOU WEAR THAT AS SOON AS YOU WEAR THAT YOU'RE A SAD SINGLE PERSON 
YOU'RE WRONG THAT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE FEEL THEY FEEL CONFIDENT THAT'S THE FEEDBACK WE'VE HAD 
IS THAT IT GIVES THEM A LITTLE BIT OF CONFIDENCE 
IT'S ALWAYS AMAZING HOW MUCH FEEDBACK YOU GET BACK FROM PEOPLE WHO YOU'VE GIVEN SOMETHING TO FOR NOTHING 
NO BUYERS WE HAVE EMAILS FROM PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT IT I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M THINKING OF THIS NOW 
I'M SORRY IT'S LUDICROUS I'M OUT 
O. K. FINE 
CLAIRE GILL 
I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS GONNA MAKE ANY MONEY AND I THINK FROM AN INVESTMENT POINT OF VIEW 
TO PUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INTO THIS 
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SELL I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY BUT IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE MILLIONS 
AND FOR THAT REASON I MEAN I WAS GOING TO SAY I'M NOT UP FOR IT BUT I'M OUT 
O. K. THANK YOU 
FOUR DRAGONS OUT AND ALL THAT LIES BETWEEN THE DUO AND EXPULSION FROM THE DEN IS ONE MULTI MILLIONAIRE 
SADLY FOR THEM IT'S THE ONE WHO COULD FIND NO REDEEMING FEATURES IN THE PRODUCT FROM THE OUTSET 
DEBORAH MEADEN HAS ONE LAST BONE TO PICK WITH THE ENTREPRENEURS 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK YOUR IDEA IS WORTH WHAT VALUE HAVE YOU PUT ON YOUR IDEA 
WELL WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR FROM THE DRAGONS WE'VE PUT IN A VALUE 
OF HALF A MILLION AND I KNOW BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING 
SAY THAT AGAIN OUT LOUD AND TELL ME IF THAT SOUNDS A BIT LUDICROUS 
NO IT DOESN'T SOUND LUDICROUS TO ME 
YOU'VE SOLD EIGHT HUNDRED WORTH OF GOODS AND YOUR EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY WORTH OF TURNOVER 
IS WORTH HALF A MILLION POUNDS NOT AT THE MOMENT NO BUT AS A. 
OH OH STOP RIGHT THERE NOT AT THE MOMENT 
WHEN ARE YOU ASKING ME TO INVEST AT THE MOMENT OR WHEN YOU'VE ALREADY GOT YOUR TURNOVER IN THE FUTURE 
THE INVESTMENT'S REQUIRED FOR US TO ACHIEVE OUR POTENTIAL 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING YEAH BUT YOUR VALUE OF YOUR BUSINESS IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY 
SO I'M AFRAID YOU CAN HEAR EXACTLY WHERE I'M GOING I'M OUT 
CLAIRE AND GILL HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE FULL FORCE OF THE DRAGONS' SCORN 
AND LEAVE WITHOUT EVER MANAGING TO CONVINCE THEM THEIR BASIC IDEA IS A GOOD ONE 
SPEECHLESS I'M SPEECHLESS TINGOTANG GONE ALONG 
I THINK A RUBBER STAMP WOULD HAVE WORKED 
A RUBBER STAMP ON THE FOREHEAD I DUNNO ENOUGH YEAH 
ENTREPRENEURS HOPING FOR INVESTMENT IN FOOD OR DRINKS BASED BUSINESSES 
ALWAYS TRY TO TEMPT THE DRAGONS WITH TASTY TITBITS 
UNFORTUNATELY ONLY RARELY DO THEY SUCCEED IN WHETTING THE MULTI MILLIONAIRES' APPETITES 
FATHER AND SON TEAM JOHN AND DANIEL HEMMINGS FROM ANGLESEY 
WANTED A NINETY THOUSAND INVESTMENT IN THEIR MR. STRIPEY 
A SIX SYRUP FLAVOUR INVENTION 
DESIGNED TO REVOLUTIONISE THE U. K.'S ICE CREAM INDUSTRY 
YOU'VE HEARD OF MR. WHIPPY YOU'VE HEARD OF MISTER SOFTEE 
I GIVE YOU MR. STRIPEY 
AT FIRST THE DRAGONS LAPPED IT UP BUT BEFORE LONG THE ICE CREAM MEN'S PITCH WENT INTO MELTDOWN 
YOU'RE MAKING THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND YOU'VE SOLD TWENTY OVER WHAT PERIOD DID YOU SELL THE TWENTY 
SINCE OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND THREE OH MY GOD THAT'S TERRIBLE 
JOHN TRIED IN VAIN TO COUNTER THE CRITICISMS 
WE'RE FIRED UP WITH MR. STRIPEY WE KNOW THAT MR. STRIPEY SELLS 
JOHN I'M THEO MR. STRIPEY DOESN'T QUITE SELL 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE WHO BEGAN HIS MULTI MILLION POUND EMPIRE 
WITH JUST ONE ICE CREAM VAN WAS ADAMANT THE INVENTION WAS BEHIND THE TIMES 
ICE CREAM MACHINES WILL NOT SELL IN THE U. K. THE WAY THEY DID THIRTY YEARS AGO 
D'YOU KNOW WHY BECAUSE THIRTY YEARS AGO WE DIDN'T HAVE 
SUPERMARKETS THAT SELL ICE CREAM THE WAY THEY SELL ICE CREAM NOW 
AND FINALLY DEBORAH MEADEN WITH HER OWN EXPERIENCE OF THE ICE CREAM BUSINESS 
DREW A LINE UNDER MR. STRIPEY'S TIME IN THE DEN 
CAN I TELL YOU I'M GOING TO EXPLODE I HAD UNTIL ABOUT A MONTH AGO SIX ICE CREAM PARLOURS 
AND I AM NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST BIT INTERESTED 
IN BUYING A MR. STRIPEY FROM YOU SO I'M AFRAID FOR THAT REASON I'M OUT 
THAT'S THE WAY THE COOKIE CRUMBLES 
THE DRAGONS OFTEN TAKE ISSUE WITH A HIGH VALUATION OF A COMPANY 
SO CAN DESIGN GRADUATE ANTHONY CLOUGH FROM WIMBLEDON 
JUSTIFY AN INVESTMENT OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR TEN PER CENT OF HIS BUSINESS 
GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ANTHONY CLOUGH 
I'M THE M. D. OF THE MAGNETIC CONNECTION COMPANY 
TODAY I'M ASKING FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR AN INVESTMENT OF TEN PER CENT IN MY COMPANY 
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU A GREAT NEW WAY TO CHANGE A LIGHT BULB 
THE BULB SIMPLY PUSHES IN AND PULLS OUT BECAUSE MY PRODUCT RETAINS IT MAGNETICALLY 
THE DESIGN COMES IN TWO PARTS ONE SLIPS OVER ANY NORMAL BULB AND THE OTHER 
TO THE EXISTING LAMP HOLDER SO I'VE GOT A DEMONSTRATION MODEL HERE 
SO I'VE INVENTED NO LIGHT FITTING AT ALL 
IT'S TWO PLASTIC PIECES ONE HAS MAGNETS TO GO AROUND THE LAMP HOLDER 
SO IT CLIPS ONTO AN EXISTING FITTING AND THE OTHER ONE 
CLIPS ONTO A BULB SO IT COMES OFF AND GOES ON SO THIS IS DONE 
EITHER BOUGHT ON OR PUT ON EASILY AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO CHANGE THE BULB THEY JUST COME TOGETHER 
I SECURED A PATENT FOR THIS IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
IT WENT TO INTERNATIONAL P. C. T. STATION TWO THOUSAND SIX 
AND SUBSEQUENTLY I'VE FILED TWO MORE PATENT APPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENTS 
THE KEY ADVANTAGE IS THAT IT TAKES JUST ONE HAND TO CHANGE THE BULB 
THIS HAS BIG ADVANTAGES IN THE WORKPLACE AND IN THE HOME 
IN THE WORKPLACE TIME TAKEN TO CHANGE BULBS 
CAN BE REDUCED BY THREE TIMES 
AND ALSO THERE ARE HEALTH AND SAFETY ADVANTAGES FROM PEOPLE NOT NEEDING TO GO UP LADDERS 
SOMEWHERE THE SIZE OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE CAN SAVE APPROXIMATELY FORTY THOUSAND PER ANNUM 
ON REPLACING THEIR HIGH NUMBER OF BULBS 
IN THE HOME IT MAKES IT EASY FOR EVERYONE TO HAVE A SAFE WAY TO CHANGE A BULB 
THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND I'M ASKING FOR IN INVESTMENT 
WILL PAY FOR PRODUCTION TOOLING CERTIFICATION AND PATENT COSTS 
IT'S A SIMPLE LOW COST IDEA WHICH TRANSFORMS 
AN AWKWARD TASK INTO ONE THAT'S SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD 
AND SUITABLE FOR EVERYONE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT MY BUSINESS 
THIRTY ONE YEAR OLD LONDONER ANTHONY CLOUGH HAS DELIVERED AN AUTHORITATIVE PITCH 
FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND OF INVESTMENT IN HIS MAGNETIC INVENTION 
DESIGNED TO MAKE CHANGING BULBS EASIER 
BUT HE'S OFFERING JUST TEN PER CENT OF HIS FLEDGLING COMPANY IN RETURN 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT THE BUSINESS FORECASTS FOR ANTHONY'S PRODUCT 
ANTHONY WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY SELL 
IS IT AN ATTACHMENT ONTO SOMEONE ELSE'S LIGHT BULB IT'S AN ATTACHMENT FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S BULB 
O. K. WHAT PRICE WOULD YOU BE SELLING THEM AT I'D SELL IT TO A RETAILER AT FORTY P. PLUS VAT 
AND WHAT WOULD IT COST YOU TWELVE POINT TWO PENCE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO PENCE 
YOU VALUE YOUR COMPANY AT APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION 
YES D'YOU KNOW HOW MANY TWELVE AND A HALF P.'S THERE ARE IN THAT ER YES 
HAVE YOU PROJECTED HOW MANY YOU'LL SELL FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS 
YES OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS THE TURNOVER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WILL BE JUST SHORT 
OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND NET PROFIT IS ZERO GROSS PROFIT IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
TWO THOUSAND NINE THE TURNOVER IS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION NET PROFIT ROUGHLY NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
TWO THOUSAND TEN THE TURNOVER UP TO SEVEN FIVE MILLION 
THREE POINT FIVE MILLION OR SO NET PROFIT 
ANTHONY'S CONFIDENCE IN HIS INVENTION SEEMS UNSHAKEABLE 
NOW PETER JONES WANTS TO KNOW HOW THE YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR 
BECAME INVOLVED IN THIS SECTOR IN THE FIRST PLACE 
ANTHONY TELL ME ABOUT YOU WHY DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS IDEA 
I WAS SITTING WHEN DID YOU HAVE THIS GREAT LIGHT BULB MOMENT RIGHT 
AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF ART IN INDUSTRIAL DESIGN ENGINEERING IN AN ERGONOMICS SLASH HUMAN FACTORS MODULE 
TO COME UP WITH A PRODUCT AIDING A HUMAN INTEGRATING WITH THEIR LIFE 
I THOUGHT OF PEOPLE THAT COULDN'T CHANGE LIGHT BULBS DUE TO MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS ETC 
THEN I REALISED IT'S SUITABLE FOR EVERYONE AND THERE'S A BUSINESS MARKET BEHIND IT TOO 
O. K. WHAT HAVE YOU TRIED TO DO YOU'VE GOT THIS GREAT IDEA WHERE HAVE YOU TAKEN IT 
WELL I'VE GOT SOME INITIAL ANGEL BASED FUNDING WHICH IS TAKEN ME TO THIS STAGE 
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE I HAVE A SECURED LOAN OF SIXTY THOUSAND IN THE BUSINESS 
AND WHAT DID THEY GET IN EQUITY SHARE FOR THAT 
IN EQUITY GRESHAM HOUSE AN AUTHORISED INVESTMENT TRUST HAS FORTY PER CENT 
FORTY PER CENT YES 
RIGHT THE REASON WHY IT'S SUCH A HIGH AMOUNT 
WAS THAT I WAS STRAIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE AND COULD DO NOTHING 
SO THEY PAID FOR THE PATENT COSTS I WAS EAGER TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT STRAIGHTAWAY 
A LOAN AND IN RETURN FOR THAT LOAN THEY CHARGED YOU A FEE 
OF FORTY PER CENT OF THE COMPANY YOU STILL HAVE TO REPAY THE SIXTY THOUSAND 
THAT'S RIGHT YES 
THIS IS AN ORGANISATION WITH MONEY COMING OUT OF THEIR EARS 
AND FOR SOME REASON THEY DO NOT WANT TO FUND YOU ANY FURTHER 
THEY'RE NOT SAYING THEY WON'T PUT THE MONEY IN WHY ARE YOU HERE THEN 
WE'RE INVITING YOU THINK IF YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH AN INVESTMENT OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION 
A RIDICULOUS VALUATION FOR YOUR COMPANY 
YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT MUGS YOU PROBABLY WORK WITH THEM DO YOU THINK WE ARE NO NOT AT ALL 
COULD I BRING UP MY ADVOCATE PLEASE CRAIG ROCHFORD 
WELL IF HE'S GOT THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BY ALL MEANS 
I THINK HE WILL BRING HIM UP 
ANTHONY HAS DROPPED A BOMBSHELL AND IT'S LEFT THE DRAGONS FEELING DECIDEDLY UNEASY 
UNDER DEN RULES ENTREPRENEURS CAN SUMMON ADVOCATES 
TO HELP WITH SPECIFIC AREAS OF THEIR PITCH 
SO CAN CRAIG ROCHFORD ANTHONY'S BUSINESS PARTNER 
HELP RESTORE THE MULTI MILLIONAIRES' FAITH IN THE INVENTION 
THIS IS CRAIG ROCHFORD 
CRAIG DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO WHY GRESHAM 
WHO GOT SHARES FOR NOTHING WHY AREN'T THEY FUNDING FURTHER DEVELOPMENT 
THEY HAVEN'T SAID THAT WHEN YOU APPROACHED THEM FOR MONEY TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL 
NO WE DIDN'T ASK FOR MORE MONEY WHY WE DON'T NEED MORE MONEY YET 
BUT WHY HAVE YOU COME TO US 
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU GUYS CAN OFFER I MEAN YOU KNOW 
BUT YOU'RE OFFERING US A RIDICULOUS VALUATION 
I WOULD RATHER PAINT THE EIFFEL TOWER 
FOR FREE THAN INVEST ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND OF MY MONEY 
AND GET TEN PER CENT OF YOUR COMPANY AND THAT'S WHY I'M OUT 
O. K. 
ANTHONY'S BEEN BLASTED BY PETER JONES WHO'S WALKED AWAY FROM ANY FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS 
BUT DUNCAN BANNATYNE SEEMS TO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE ON HIS MIND 
WELL OFTEN WHEN YOU'VE GOT A FAMILY 
AND A LOT OF CHILDREN YOU'RE SITTING ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON WITH YOUR FEET UP IN FRONT OF THE FIRE 
READING THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPER AND YOUR CHILDREN GO OUT TO PLAY IN THE BACK GARDEN 
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CHILDREN THAT MEANS THEY CAN NEVER SHUT A DOOR 
SO THEY LEAVE THE BACK DOOR OPEN 
AND HALF AN HOUR LATER THEY COME IN 
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT MAKES THEM COME IN THE FRONT DOOR 
SO THE FRONT DOOR'S OPEN AND THE BACK DOOR'S OPEN 
AND THEN FOR SOME REASON I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE WIND THERE'S ALWAYS 
THIS BANG ONE OF THE DOORS GOES BANG AND SHUTS HAVE YOU EVER EXPERIENCED THAT 
YES IT HAPPENS IN THE HOUSE ALL THE TIME AND I KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENS 
WHEN THAT WIND COMES IN AND THE DOOR SHUTS AND THERE'S A BANG 
THAT'S WHAT'LL HAPPEN 
I'LL HAVE BROKEN LIGHT BULBS ALL OVER THE HOUSE IN MY CHILDREN'S BEDROOMS 
THIS THING IS DANGEROUS 
IT REALLY IS SO I DON'T WANNA INVEST SO I'M OUT 
TWO DRAGONS OUT AND ANTHONY'S PITCH IS IN TROUBLE 
NOW JAMES CAAN THINKS HE'S SPOTTED SOMETHING HIS RIVAL MULTI MILLIONAIRES HAVE MISSED 
I CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT DUNCAN DID AND I CAN SEE WHY IT FELL 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETS ARE ONLY AT EACH END 
BUT IF THEY WERE AT FOUR ENDS THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO IT 
THIS WAY IT DOESN'T HAPPEN 
IF YOU HOLD IT THIS WAY IT DOES FALL 
SO IS THERE ANY REASON WHY WE COULDN'T HAVE MAGNETS IN FOUR SPACES WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE THAT PROBLEM 
NO NOT AT ALL 
I QUITE LIKE IT 
I QUITE LIKE THE IDEA IT'S SIMPLE IT'S BASIC IT'S EASY 
AND ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE PRODUCT ITSELF 
I CAN SEE THAT SELLING IN THE SHOPS AND I THINK YOUR PRICING IS SPOT ON 
I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN MAKING AN OFFER 
I'D LIKE TO OFFER YOU HALF THE MONEY 
FOR A ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT STAKE IN THE BUSINESS 
ON THE SAME TERMS AS GRESHAM HAVE INVESTED IN 
I. E. IT'S A LOAN NOTE AND IT GETS REPAID 
RIGHT 
IN A SURPRISE MOVE JAMES CAAN HAS OFFERED ANTHONY HALF THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
ON THE SAME TERMS AS THE EXISTING PRIVATE INVESTOR 
ANTHONY MUST NOW PERSUADE DEBORAH MEADEN OR THEO PAPHITIS 
TO OFFER AT LEAST THE OTHER HALF IF HE'S TO SUCCEED IN THE DEN 
O. K. LET ME JUST TELL YOU WHERE I AM BECAUSE 
I DON'T LIKE THIS IDEA I'M NOT CONVINCED ABOUT IT 
THE ANSWERS I'M GETTING ARE NOT SATISFACTORY THERE'S DESIGN FAULTS 
DID YOU TELL YOUR INVESTOR THAT YOU WERE COMING HERE OF COURSE 
WE HAD TO GET PERMISSION IN WRITING AND WHAT DID THEY SAY THEY SAID O. K. 
U. P. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I SHOULD THINK 
I AM JUST STAGGERED I JUST THINK 
WHILST THE CONCEPT MIGHT HAVE STARTED AS A GOOD IDEA 
AND AS GOOD CONCEPT FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS I JUST THINK 
YOU'VE NOW TOTALLY AND UTTERLY LOST THE PLOT 
AND FOR THOSE REASONS YOU'VE LOST ME SO I'M OUT RIGHT 
ANTHONY CRAIG I'VE SAT HERE AND LISTENED TO AND SEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF THINGS THAT DISTURB ME 
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME UP I THOUGHT WHAT A NEAT IDEA THAT'S GREAT 
THE PROBLEM IS 
YOU HAVE GIVEN AWAY FORTY PER CENT OF YOUR BUSINESS 
THAT'S THE ONE STATEMENT 
YOU HAVE A LOAN 
SECURED AGAINST YOUR BUSINESS 
IT'S NOT SECURED IT'S UNSECURED O. K. SECURED AGAINST THE COMPANY 
IT'S SECURED SO IN OTHER WORDS IF THE COMPANY HAS ANY MONEY IN IT 
IT GETS THAT MONEY BACK AND STILL OWNS FORTY PER CENT OF THE BUSINESS 
JAMES IS OFFERING YOU A SIMILAR DEAL SO THAT YOU WILL HAVE GIVEN AWAY SIXTY PER CENT OF YOUR BUSINESS 
YES AND IF I'M NOT CAREFUL ONE DAY I'LL FIND YOU'VE GIVEN AWAY NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF THE BUSINESS 
YOU COULDN'T CARE LESS WHETHER OR NOT YOU SOLD ANY LIGHT BULBS 
SO YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF COMPLETELY UN INVESTIBLE 
AND I JUST URGE YOU THINK VERY CAREFULLY WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR SHARES 
O. K. THANK YOU SO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY 
OF COURSE YEAH I'M OUT 
ANTHONY'S CHANCES OF INVESTMENT ARE HANGING BY A THREAD 
HIS ONLY HOPE NOW IS THAT JAMES CAAN WILL SEE ENOUGH POTENTIAL 
IN HIS YOUNG BUSINESS TO BACK ANTHONY WITH ALL THE MONEY HE'S ASKED FOR 
WELL ANTHONY CRAIG I GAVE YOU A LIFELINE I GAVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO CONVINCE THE OTHER DRAGONS I STILL THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY STAGE TO GIVE YOU ALL THE MONEY 
UNFORTUNATELY REGRETTABLY 
GIVE HIM THE MONEY IF YOU'RE THAT REGRETTABLY ABOUT IT STOP OFFERING HALF 
NO NO I THINK I'M COMFORTABLE IN MY POSITION 
THANK YOU THEO FOR SPENDING MY MONEY FOR ME BUT I'M QUITE CAPABLE OF MAKING THOSE DECISIONS 
AND FOR THOSE REASONS I'M OUT O. K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AFTER A GRUELLING SESSION IN THE DEN 
ANTHONY AND HIS ADVOCATE CRAIG HAVE BEEN DEFEATED BY THE DRAGONS AND LEAVE EMPTY HANDED 
THE DRAGONS RECEIVE NO INFORMATION BEFOREHAND ABOUT ANY OF THE ENTREPRENEURS 
AND THEY NEVER KNOW WHO OR WHAT WILL BE APPEARING NEXT BEFORE THEM IN THE DEN 
BARRY HALLIDAY FROM NORTHAMPTONSHIRE WAS LOOKING FOR A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INVESTMENT 
IN WHAT'S YOUR TAG A UNIQUELY CODED FASHION RANGE 
AIMED AT THE YOUTH MARKET 
IN ESSENCE WHAT'S YOUR TAG HAVE A NEW ALPHABET CODES 
WE FELT THE BEST WAY TO GET THAT OUT INTO THE MARKET WAS TO LAUNCH OUR VERY OWN FASHION COLLECTION 
EACH ITEM COMES WITH A DIFFERENT WHAT'S YOUR TAG CODE 
BUT THEO PAPHITIS COULDN'T DECIPHER WHAT BARRY WAS ON ABOUT 
I'D LIKE TO SAY I GOT IT BUT I HAVEN'T MANAGED TO GET WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL ME 
WE'VE GOT A FUNKY FUN INTERESTING CODE 
WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE SOME LIFESTYLE SOME EXPRESSION 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE HAD SOME QUESTIONS OF HIS OWN 
COME ON WHAT'S THE POINT IN THE CODE 
BECAUSE IT'S FUN IT'S FUN IS IT AND IT'S DIFFERENT 
AND THE WRITING WAS ALL TOO SOON ON THE WALL FOR BARRY 
WHAT'S THAT DON'T YOU READ THE CODE 
I WROTE EXACTLY THE SAME 
IT SAYS I AM OUT THAT'S THE CODE 
SERIAL INVENTOR MATTHEW WHITE ALSO WANTED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO PERFECT HIS LATEST PROTOTYPE 
A STYLISH HAND DRYER WITH A DIFFERENCE 
MY INVENTION BASICALLY DRIES YOUR HANDS 
AND IT USES INFRARED HEAT ALLOWING MORE WATER TO EVAPORATE 
IT'S LIKE BATHING YOUR HANDS IN SUNLIGHT 
DEBORAH MEADEN WAS KEEN TO ROAD TEST THE DEVICE 
I MEAN THE FIRST THING YOU'LL NOTICE IS HOW QUIET IT IS 
SO WE CAN HOLD A NORMAL CONVERSATION WHILE IT'S ON YEAH 
THE SECOND THING I NOTICE IS MY HANDS AREN'T FEELING TERRIBLY DRY 
YOUR HANDS ARE VERY WET SO IT'S TAKING A WHILE 
WELL WHEN YOU WASH YOUR HANDS GUESS WHAT 
YES THEY GET VERY WET 
BUT PETER JONES THOUGHT THERE WAS A BIGGER PROBLEM WITH THE INVENTION 
THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A TUMBLE DRYER UM 
A SMALL SIZED TUMBLE DRYER MAYBE 
AND JAMES CAAN THOUGHT THE HAND DRYER WAS SIMPLY A LOT OF HOT AIR 
HONESTLY IF I WERE YOU I'D PACK IT IN 
I THINK YOU'RE SO EARLY IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT PHASE I THINK YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME 
CAN I MY PERSPECTIVE MATTHEW ABSOLUTELY NOT REALLY 
I DON'T WANNA HEAR ANY MORE I WAS GONNA AGREE WITH YOU 
I'M GLAD YOU'RE GONNA AGREE AND FOR THAT REASON MATTHEW BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA AGREE WITH ME I'M OUT 
SO FAR TONIGHT NO ONE HAS LEFT THE DEN WITH AN INVESTMENT 
BUT WILL ANY OF THESE INTREPID ENTREPRENEURS PERSUADE 
THE MULTI MILLIONAIRES TO BACK THEM WITH THEIR OWN CASH 
YOU'RE IN DANGER OF MUCKING UP THIS WHOLE PRODUCT BECAUSE YOU'RE BEING GREEDY 
I THINK THAT THE WHOLE PITCH WAS ABSOLUTELY APPALLING 
IF SOMETHING LOOKS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT'S GENERALLY TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE 
REMEMBER NO WRITTEN PROMPTS ARE ALLOWED IN THE DEN 
SO IT'S VITAL THAT ENTREPRENEURS KNOW ALL THE FACTS ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS BY HEART 
NEXT UP IS AILEEN HOLMES FROM DEVON 
CAN SHE STAND UP TO THE DRAGONS' SCRUTINY AND WALK AWAY WITH AN INVESTMENT OF NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
I'M AILEEN HOLMES AND I'M MANAGING DIRECTOR 
HEAD COOK AND BOTTLE WASHER OF THE HAPPY HORSE COMPANY 
THE LIMPET SADDLE PAD IS THE PRINCIPLE PROPERTY THAT I MARKET 
AND SADDLE PADS GENERALLY 
ARE MADE OF WOOL SHEEPSKINS FLEECES 
ER FELT AND COTTON 
ALL GENERATE A FRICTION AND A DISCOMFORT 
TO THE HORSES THAT CARRY THESE PADS 
IT ALSO HAS A CONCUSSION ABSORPTION THAT IS QUITE HUGE 
LIMPET ACTUALLY ALLOWS THAT CONCUSSION TO BE ABSORBED 
AND THE HORSE'S BACKS TO BE SAFE 
THE OTHER ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS THE ANTI SLIP HOLDS YOUR SADDLE STILL 
WE 
I'VE MARKETED IT BOTH HERE AND IN THE UNITED STATES 
AND IT WAS AN AMATEUR THIS IS UP TILL NOW IT'S BEEN A HUGELY AMATEUR GAME 
RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING TWO A DAY IF YOU LIKE 
MY BELIEF IS THAT WE CAN INCREASE THAT QUITE EASILY 
TO TWENTY FIVE A DAY 
THANK YOU 
A NERVOUS AILEEN HOLMES HAS FINALLY REACHED THE END OF HER PITCH 
FOR A NINETY FIVE THOUSAND INVESTMENT 
IN HER HAPPY HORSE BREATHABLE LIMPET SADDLE PAD 
IT'S DEVISED TO MAKE HORSE RIDING SAFER AND MORE COMFORTABLE FOR EQUESTRIAN AND MOUNT 
BUT HAS HER STUMBLING PRESENTATION ALIENATED THE DRAGONS 
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE HORSE 
I'M GOING TO CALL HIM CHARLIE CHARLIE 
AND HE WAS VERY NAUGHTY WHAT I THOUGHT HE WAS VERY GOOD HE DIDN'T MOVE AT ALL 
WELL HE COULD HAVE DROPPED HIS HEAD SIR OH ABSOLUTELY 
HE COULD HAVE DROPPED SOMETHING ELSE AND IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD IN THE DEN 
RIGHT AILEEN JUST VERY BRIEFLY TELL ME ABOUT YOU AND YOUR JOURNEY 
BEFORE WE GO THROUGH FIGURES WHICH I'LL COME BACK TO 
YOUR JOURNEY IN CREATING THE LIMPET SADDLE PAD 
I ACTUALLY BREED SHOW HORSES 
THEY'RE ANGLO ARABIANS AND HUGELY SUCCESSFUL 
THEY'RE WORLD CLASS HORSES EIGHTEEN SUPREME CHAMPIONS 
SO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF AN EXPERT IN THE FIELD I DO YES IT'S PART 
AND HOW MANY YEARS HAVE YOU BEEN DOING IT FOR SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY TWO 
O. K. I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE OR 
I'M NOT GOING TO COUNT IT SIR 
O. K. THAT SOUNDS FINE AND WHEN DID YOU START MARKETING 
I STARTED MARKETING IT IN NINETY FOUR BUT IT WAS TERRIBLY SLOW BECAUSE 
YOU BET IT'S TERRIBLY SLOW NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
YES BUT IT WAS A HOBBY TO BE FAIR 
I DON'T DO MARKETING I FOAL MARES 
I DON'T DO MARKETING YOU SOUND AS IF YOU DO SOMETHING SUCCESSFULLY 
AND WHEN ONE PERSON DOES SOMETHING SUCCESSFULLY 
THEY'VE NORMALLY GOT AN EYE FOR WHAT IS SUCCESSFUL AND WHAT ISN'T 
AND MARKETING A PRODUCT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND SELLING TWO A DAY 
THAT'S RIGHT IS NOT SUCCESSFUL 
THEO PAPHITIS MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FAULT THE HORSEWOMAN'S EXPERIENCE 
BUT HE'S SCEPTICAL ABOUT HER POOR SALES FIGURES 
WILL DEBORAH MEADEN AN EXPERIENCED RIDER BE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE SADDLE PAD 
HELLO ALI HELLO HI I'M DEBORAH 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT THAT IS UNIQUE 
HAVE YOU GOT ANY KIND OF PROTECTION ON THAT 
THE PROTECTION BASICALLY IS THAT IT'S BEEN OUT IN THE MARKET 
AND WE ARE THE LEADER IN THIS PARTICULAR FIELD 
BUT IN THEORY LEGALLY YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROTECTION ON THAT AT ALL 
IT'S POSSIBLE THE NEXT THING IS WHAT DO EQUINE VETS SAY ABOUT IT 
HERE IN THE U. K. WHEN WE FIRST BROUGHT IT OUT 
PETER SCOTT WHO WAS THE OLYMPIC VETERINARY SURGEON 
HE APPROVED IT BUT OF COURSE HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO ENDORSE ANY PARTICULAR PRODUCT 
SO WE TOOK IT TO THE STATES AND INVITED THE LEADING BACK VETERINARY SURGEON THERE 
TO TEST IT AND EVALUATE IT AND HE CONSIDERS IT IS 
THE FINEST PRODUCT AVAILABLE TO HIM FOR BACK ISSUES 
YOU'VE BEEN OVER TO THE STATES YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT MARKETING 
YOU'VE SOLD SEVEN HUNDRED YOU'RE SELLING TWO A DAY HOW BIG'S THIS MARKET 
BASICALLY I HAVE NEVER ADVERTISED THIS YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA 
NO MA'AM NO 
AND I TAKE IT TO WHY NOT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT 
COME ON I'M SORRY THE WHOLE WORLD 
YOU MUST ADVERTISE IN SOME OF THESE PUBLICATIONS FOR YOUR HORSES NO MA'AM I DON'T 
YOU'VE SORTED OUT GOING TO A VET IN AMERICA TO SAY THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT 
BUT YOU HAVE NOT PICKED THE PHONE UP IN HORSE AND HOUND NO I HAVEN'T 
DEBORAH MEADEN SEEMS UNCONVINCED 
AND THE INTERROGATION HAS MADE DUNCAN BANNATYNE 
CURIOUS ABOUT AILEEN'S PLANS FOR THE INVESTMENT 
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE NINETY FIVE THOUSAND IF YOU RAISE IT TODAY 
THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO 
I WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A GREATER INVENTORY 
TO ALLOW ME TO MEET DEMAND AT THE MOMENT THE COST 
WHEN YOU SAY GREATER INVENTORY YOU MEAN YOU'D BUY MORE STOCK YES 
SO YOU'VE GOT A DEMAND FOR THIS THAT YOU CAN'T FULFIL NOW YES 
SO HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE IN STOCK IF ANY 
RIGHT NOW PROBABLY FIVE THOUSAND WORTH 
AND HOW MANY'S THAT WHAT PRICE DO THEY SELL AT 
THE AVERAGE PRICE IS THIRTY FIVE THIRTY SIX 
THAT'S AN AVERAGE FROM THE LITTLE TO THE BIG ONE 
BUT A MINIMUM ORDER IS GOING TO COST ME TWENTY THOUSAND 
AND THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY PROBLEM 
I HAVEN'T ENOUGH MONEY TO GENERATE ENOUGH STOCK 
TO ALLOW ME TO ADVERTISE IT'S BEEN A VICIOUS CIRCLE 
HOW MUCH IS AN ADVERT IN HOUSE AND HOUND 
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FOR A QUARTER PAGE ONCE 
IT IT DOESN'T WORK YOU'VE TRIED IT ONCE 
IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE OR SIX YES THIS IS LIKE 
THIS IS KIND OF UNFOLDING YOU'VE NEVER ADVERTISED IN HORSE AND HOUND NOW YOU'VE ADVERTISED 
AND IT DIDN'T WORK WELL I CONSIDER IT AS NEVER WE TRIED IT ONCE IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER 
NOTHING HAPPENED AND WHAT I WAS SAYING TO YOU 
WAS THAT THE COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE EQUINE INDUSTRY 
WHY ARE YOU GOING INTO THE STATES 
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE MARKET IS THERE 
BECAUSE YOU'VE SATURATED THE U. K. MARKET AT TWO SALES A DAY AND YOU'RE NOW LOOKING FOR A NEW MARKET 
I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE SATURATED IT NO NOT BY A LONG SHOT 
BUT WHY WOULDN'T YOU BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOUR SALES HAVE STAYED STATIC 
I THINK THEY'VE QUIETLY GROWN HERE BUT WITH NO ADVERTISING 
REALLY QUIETLY HAVEN'T THEY YES 
AILEEN'S CONTRADICTING HERSELF AND THE DRAGONS ARE LOSING CONFIDENCE 
JAMES CAAN HAS HEARD ENOUGH 
ALI HI I'M JAMES HI JAMES 
I THINK ALI YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
I THINK YOU'RE VERY COMPETENT IN MARKETING SALES ADVERTISING 
I THINK YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
I THINK YOUR PRODUCT HAS KIND OF HIT ITS MARKETPLACE AND I THINK YOU'RE THERE 
I DON'T THINK TAKING MONEY FROM US IS GOING TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL 
I DON'T BUY INTO YOUR STOCK ARGUMENT SO I THINK THIS WOULD BE JUST GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD 
AND ON THAT BASIS I'M OUT THANK YOU 
WELL YOU'VE GOT THIS STOCK YOU CAN'T SELL IT YOU'VE DONE ADVERTISING 
IT DOESN'T WORK YOU KNOW REALLY ANYBODY WHO TELLS YOU THAT YOU CAN DO BETTER 
IS NOT BEING KIND TO YOU SO I'LL BE KIND AND TELL YOU I'M NOT INTERESTED AND I'M OUT THANK YOU 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE AND JAMES CAAN HAVE PULLED OUT OF ANY DEAL 
WILL EQUESTRIAN DEBORAH MEADEN DISAGREE WITH HER RIVALS 
IT DOESN'T HANG TOGETHER YOUR STORY 
YOU ARE GOOD AT MARKETING YOU'VE WORKED DAMN HARD AT THIS 
AND I THINK IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN JUST A PART TIME JOB TO YOU 
BECAUSE YOU TELL US THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE DONE AND YOU'VE DONE THE RIGHT THINGS 
THE PROBLEM IS YOU'RE SELLING TWO SADDLE PADS A DAY 
AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A MASSIVE MARKET OUT THERE 
SO I'M AFRAID ON A BUSINESS LEVEL IT'S JUST OF NO INTEREST TO ME 
SO I'M OUT FINE THANK YOU 
I'VE GOT TWO ELEVEN YEAR OLDS ANNABELLE AND HOLLY AND THEY RIDE 
AND WHEN WE GO TO THE TACK SHOP I'VE LOST COUNT HOW MANY PADS THERE IS THERE 
OF DIFFERENT MAKES THE MARKET IS SERIOUSLY OVERCROWDED THAT'S RIGHT 
I DON'T THINK IT'S INVESTIBLE 
YOUR PRODUCT HAS REACHED ITS FINITE LIMIT 
SO I'M AFRAID FOR THOSE REASONS I TOO AM OUT THANK YOU 
AILEEN'S PITCH IS FALLING APART SHE'S LOST FOUR DRAGONS IN AS MANY MINUTES 
PETER JONES IS NOW THE ONLY DRAGON STILL TO DECLARE HIS POSITION 
AILEEN I'VE JUST BEEN SITTING HERE I'VE NOT SAID ANYTHING 
COS I'M JUST I'M ABSOLUTELY 
I FEEL LIKE I'M ABOUT TO GET ON MY HIGH HORSE 
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE WHOLE PITCH WAS ABSOLUTELY APPALLING 
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WE'VE SAT HERE FOR THE LAST GOD KNOWS HOW LONG 
TALKING ABOUT A RUBBER PAD FOR A HORSE 
IT'S A SHAME SIR THAT YOU'VE MISSED THE VERY POINT 
IT IS BECAUSE IT IS NOT RUBBER AND IT IS NOT CLOSED CELL 
AND BECAUSE IT IS OPEN CELL IT BREATHES IT STICKS MAKES IT UNIQUE 
YOU'VE PROVED THE PRODUCT DOESN'T SELL 
YOU'RE UNINVESTIBLE SO I'M OUT THANK YOU GOODBYE BYE BYE 
THE DRAGONS COULDN'T DOUBT AILEEN'S EQUESTRIAN CREDENTIALS 
BUT IN THE END THEY JUST DIDN'T THINK THEY'D MAKE ANY MONEY FROM HER HAPPY HORSE BUSINESS 
EVERY ENTREPRENEUR WHO COMES TO THE DEN THINKS THEIR IDEA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE THEM MILLIONS 
SADLY VERY FEW MANAGE TO PERSUADE THE DRAGONS LIKEWISE 
LIKE BUSINESSMEN JOHN BARSTEAD AND MARK TRACEY WHO WANTED A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND INVESTMENT 
IN THEIR PORTABLE CHILDREN'S SWIMMING POOL ALARM 
DOLPHIN ALARMS HAVE DEVELOPED A SWIMMING POOL ALARM SYSTEM 
TO HELP PREVENT ACCIDENTAL DROWNING OF CHILDREN IN SWIMMING POOLS AND PONDS 
IT CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS 
A RECEIVER WHICH STAYS IN THE POOL ALL THE TIME AND A TRANSMITTER YOU STRAP TO THE CHILD 
THE DRAGONS COULD SEE POTENTIAL IN THE PRODUCT 
BUT DUNCAN BANNATYNE THOUGHT HE'S SPOTTED AN OBVIOUS FLAW 
MY CHILD WOULDN'T WEAR THAT 
WOULD THEY WEAR A WRISTBAND OR AN ARMBAND OR A CHESTBAND 
THEO PAPHITIS BLASTED THE DUO ON THEIR PRICING STRATEGY 
THE COST WAS HOW MUCH TWENTY ONE 
AND YOU SELL TO THE RETAILERS AT SIXTY SIX 
WOW 
YOU'RE IN DANGER OF MUCKING UP THIS WHOLE PRODUCT BECAUSE YOU'RE BEING GREEDY 
IN THE END IT WAS LEFT TO JAMES CAAN TO BRING THE ENTREPRENEURS' TIME IN THE DEN TO A SPEEDY END 
CAN I JUST TELL YOU GUYS I THINK THE ALARM HAS GONE OFF FOR ME I'M OUT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
SIBLINGS DEBORAH COATES AND PETER CADDICK WERE AFTER A SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND INVESTMENT IN THE SERAPHINA 
AN ELASTICATED PRE AND POST PREGNANCY SUPPORT BELT 
THE SERAPHINA WORKS IN TWO WAYS 
FIRSTLY IT HELPS PULL THE TUMMY MUSCLES BACK IN 
AND SECONDLY IT'S ALSO HELPING TO SUPPORT THE BACK 
PETER JONES COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY THE BELT OUT FOR SIZE 
I'M GETTING A BIT HOT AND FLUSTERED HERE 
BUT THE HILARITY DIDN'T LAST LONG FOR DUNCAN BANNATYNE 
I QUITE BELIEVE THAT EVERYBODY LOVES IT BUT THE TROUBLE IS NONE OF THESE PEOPLE ARE BUYING IT 
WE'RE PRETTY EARLY DAYS HERE 
I'M NOT SAYING I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SELL THIS FOR THREE YEARS 
DEBORAH HAS SPOKEN TO EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD ABOUT IT SHE HASN'T NO I'VE SPOKEN TO LADIES 
FOR LINGERIE MAGNATE THEO PAPHITIS THE SERAPHINA WAS OLD NEWS 
YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED TO KNOW I'VE SEEN IT MANY TIMES BEFORE 
AND THE REASON YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THEM SURVIVE IN THE U. K. IS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T SOLD 
ULTIMATELY THE DUO FAILED TO SQUEEZE ANY INVESTMENT OUT OF THE MULTI MILLIONAIRES 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I CAN INVEST IN TO MAKE MONEY OUT OF 
I CAN'T SEE WHERE IT'LL COME FROM I CALL A LIFESTYLE BUSINESS 
AND I SAY TO YOU GOOD LUCK BUT I'M OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHEERS 
FIRST TIME I'VE EVER PUT ON A GIRDLE 
NEXT UP IS PETER MOULE FROM HERTFORDSHIRE 
HE'S LOOKING FOR AN INVESTMENT OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
BUT AS ALWAYS THE RULES OF DRAGON'S DEN STATE HE MUST GET 
AT LEAST THE FULL INVESTMENT OR HE LEAVES WITH NOTHING 
HELLO MY NAME'S PETER MOULE 
I'M MANAGING DIRECTOR AND OWNER OF A COMPANY CALLED ELECTRO EXPO LIMITED 
I'M SEEKING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR TEN PER CENT EQUITY IN MY COMPANY 
ABOUT SEVENTY YEARS AGO SOMEBODY INVENTED THIS THE POLYTHENE CONNECTOR 
IT IS USED TO JOIN CABLES TOGETHER 
UNFORTUNATELY THEY DIDN'T INVENT AN ENCLOSURE TO PUT IT INTO 
HENCE THIS 
I'M SURE YOU'LL ALL IDENTIFY WITH THIS AND IT DOESN'T MEET CURRENT REGULATIONS 
I INVENTED THIS COS I SAW A GAP IN THE MARKET 
ONE SIMPLE BOX HAS ALL THESE APPLICATIONS 
IT CAN BE AN IN LINE CONNECTOR A JUNCTION BOX 
A CONDUIT BOX OR AN ENCLOSURE FOR DATA OR TELECOM CONNECTIONS 
WE CURRENTLY SELL IN EXCESS OF ONE MILLION UNITS A YEAR AND MAKE A PROFIT IN EXCESS OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
THE FUTURE FOR THE CHOCBOX IS ABSOLUTELY IMMENSE 
I'M LOOKING AT THE DRAGONS TO TAKE THE CHOCBOX TO THE NEXT LEVEL 
THAT IS THE DOMESTIC RETAIL MARKET EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES 
I'M CONFIDENT THAT WITH THE DRAGONS' EXPERTISE IN THREE YEARS' TIME 
WE COULD BE SELLING IN EXCESS OF SIX MILLION UNITS A YEAR 
AND MAKING A PROFIT IN EXCESS OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION 
THANK YOU LET ME SEE THAT PETER 
SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR PETER MOULE IS ASKING THE DRAGONS FOR A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND INVESTMENT 
IN HIS COMPANY ELECTRO EXPO IN RETURN FOR A TEN PER CENT STAKE 
BUT WITH THE COMPANY ALREADY DOING SO WELL 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE HAS A KEY QUESTION FOR THE BUSINESSMAN 
THANK YOU PETER 
AS YOU GIVE ME YOUR PITCH AND YOU TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS SELLING 
A MILLION PER YEAR THAT'S CORRECT IN EXCESS 
AND YOU'RE MAKING THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER ANNUM PROFIT YEP 
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH MY MIND WAS 
WHY DID YOU NEED ANY INVESTOR 
THE REASON BEING IS THAT I'M SELLING IT TO THE TRADE MARKET 
I'D LIKE TO TAKE IT TO THE DOMESTIC AND RETAIL MARKET 
TO EUROPE AND TO THE UNITED STATES I'VE NO EXPERTISE IN THE RETAIL MARKET 
I'VE NO EXPERTISE IN EXPORT 
I NEED TO GEAR IT UP FOR THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE 
IF YOU REALISE THERE'S THIRTY FIVE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS 
IN ENGLAND EVERY SINGLE HOUSEHOLD COULD DO WITH ONE OF THESE 
PETER WHY IS IT A DOMESTIC MARKET SITUATION 
MOST PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN HOUSES HAVE THEIR WIRING DONE BY SOMEONE ELSE 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE IS DEEPLY DUBIOUS ABOUT ANY POTENTIAL FOR THE CHOCBOX IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET 
WILL THEO PAPHITIS AGREE WITH HIS RIVAL 
PETER HI I'M THEO I'VE JUST GOT TO COME IN HERE 
COS DUNCAN IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
TO ACTUALLY DO ANY FORM OF WIRING IN A HOUSE NOW 
YOU HAVE TO BE A QUALIFIED ELECTRICIAN 
SO DOMESTIC PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO MESS AROUND WITH THEIR ELECTRICS 
THAT'S JUST ONE PART OF WHAT I WANT TO MOVE INTO 
THE BIG PART IS GOING INTO EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES 
YOU'VE GOT A PATENT WORLDWIDE I ASSUME NO 
EH IT'S NOT WORLDWIDE 
WHAT IS IT FOR THEN ENGLAND 
BUT YOU WANT TO GO INTO THE STATES I DO 
SO YOU'VE NOT PROTECTED THAT NOT AS YET 
ARE YOU STILL WITHIN TIME I'M NOT SURE 
THE DRAGONS ARE STUNNED THAT PETER HAS BROKEN ONE OF THE MOST BASIC RULES OF BUSINESS 
BY FAILING TO PROTECT HIS IDEA FROM COPYCAT RIVALS 
AND JAMES CAAN ISN'T PREPARED TO LET THE MATTER LIE 
I'M JUST STAGGERED WHY WOULDN'T IT HAVE DAWNED ON YOU TO REGISTER IT IN A MUCH WIDER TERRITORY 
IT'S NOT MY ONLY COMPANY 
IF IT WAS I WOULD HAVE SPENT ALL OF MY TIME ON THIS 
AND PERHAPS WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT I SHOULD HAVE 
I'M NOW AT A STAGE WHERE THIS CAN ABSOLUTELY GO FANTASTIC 
WHAT'S THE OTHER COMPANY 
IT'S AN ELECTRICAL COMPANY THAT DOES ELECTRICAL WORK IN MUSEUMS AND EXHIBITIONS 
AND HOW SUCCESSFUL IS THAT COMPANY 
AS SUCCESSFUL AS THIS COMPANY 
DOES IT MAKES THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR AS WELL YES 
PETER'S CLEARLY NOT LACKING PROFITS 
WHAT HE CLAIMS TO LACK IS THE EXPERTISE TO TAKE HIS BUSINESS GLOBAL 
IT'S A HIGHLY UNUSUAL SITUATION IN THE DEN AND IT'S UNSETTLING SOME OF THE DRAGONS 
PETER LET ME TELL YOU WHERE I AM 
WELL DONE 
YOU'VE GOT A PRODUCT OUT THERE AND IT'S SELLING IT STOPS THERE 
THE LACK OF CREDIBILITY THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GIVING YOURSELF 
MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY INVEST IN YOU 
IT DOESN'T STACK UP AND FOR THOSE REASONS I CAN'T INVEST IN YOU SO I'M OUT O. K. 
THANK YOU PETER I'M PETER HELLO 
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU SUCH A HARD TIME OVER IT ON THE BASIS THAT I ACTUALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT 
I THINK YOU'RE AT THE MAXIMUM RATE OF THE APPLICATION 
THAT'S THE REASON I'M OUT 
TWO DRAGONS OUT AND PETER'S PITCH IS SUDDENLY LOOKING SHAKY 
WILL JAMES CAAN BE PREPARED TO GIVE THE ENTREPRENEUR A SECOND CHANCE 
GIVE ME YOUR NUMBERS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WHAT'S THE TURNOVER AND PROFITABILITY BEEN 
LAST YEAR IT WAS FIVE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND AND YOU MADE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND YES 
AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT IT WAS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WHERE WE MADE THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
THE YEAR BEFORE THAT WAS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND WE MADE AROUND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU FOR THE PRODUCT WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR 
THE MARGIN I ACTUALLY PAY IS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT PENCE DELIVERED 
AND I SELL IT BETWEEN THIRTY EIGHT PENCE AND SIXTY FIVE PENCE 
IF I MAKE YOU AN OFFER PETER WHAT WOULD MY EXIT BE 
HOW ABOUT IF I OFFERED A CLAUSE WHERE I WOULD GUARANTEE TO BUY BACK YOUR SHARES 
AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME SO YOU'RE NOT RISKING ANY OF YOUR MONEY AT ALL 
AT WHAT PRICE 
FIRST OF ALL I COULD GUARANTEE TO BUY THEM BACK AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND NO PROBLEM AT ALL SO I COULD 
THAT WOULD BE CAST IN STONE 
IF NOT WE COULD HAVE IT AS A MARKET VALUE ON THE ACTUAL COMPANY VALUATION 
IT'S A DEN FIRST 
PETER IS SO DETERMINED TO SECURE THE DRAGONS' BUSINESS EXPERTISE 
HE'S OFFERING THEM A MONEY BACK GUARANTEE ON ANY INVESTMENT IN HIM 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE IS READY TO SHOW HIS HAND 
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY 
FOR SOMEONE TO INVEST IN THIS AND MAKE A RETURN O. K. 
SO I'LL GIVE YOU AN OFFER OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR TWENTY FIVE PER CENT AND I WILL ALSO GIVE YOU AN OFFER 
OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR FIFTY PER CENT OF YOUR COMPANY O. K. 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE IS KEEN TO CLINCH THIS DEAL 
WILL DEBORAH MEADEN WHO'S REMAINED SILENT UP UNTIL NOW FOLLOW SUIT 
PETER HELLO I'M DEBORAH 
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOUR BALANCE SHEET LOOKS LIKE HAVE YOU GOT ANY LOANS IN THE COMPANY NO 
HOW MUCH CASH HAVE YOU GOT SITTING IN THE BANK TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
YOU'VE GOT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CASH IN THE BANK YES 
YOU SEE I'M NOT BEING FUNNY 
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING REALLY NIGGLING AWAY AT THIS THIS 
I'M NOT ACTUALLY ASKING THE DRAGONS TO RISK ANY MONEY 
BUT D'YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS ODDLY WE'VE GOT THAT WE'VE DONE OUR NUMBERS 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT BUT YOU KNOW I JUST HAVE A SAYING 
IF SOMETHING LOOKS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT'S GENERALLY TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE 
PETER I NEED TO TELL YOU WHERE I AM 
I'M HERE TO MAKE REAL SOLID INVESTMENTS 
AND AT THE END OF IT I GET REWARD 
YOU HAVE NOT CONVINCED ME SO I'M AFRAID I SHOULD BE SNAPPING YOUR HAND OFF 
BUT I THINK I'D BE COMPLETELY WASTING MY TIME 
AND I'M NOT INTO THAT SO FOR THAT REASON I'M OUT 
AN ANGRY DEBORAH MEADEN HAS WALKED AWAY FROM ANY DEAL NOW JAMES CAAN IS READY TO HAVE HIS SAY 
O. K. PETER THAT LEAVES ME AND WHAT I'M GONNA DO PETER 
IS I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT 
I THINK IF YOU'RE GENUINE AND SERIOUS ABOUT THE INVESTMENT 
AND YOU WANNA ACHIEVE WHAT YOU'VE SAID YOU WANNA ACHIEVE 
I WOULD HAPPILY COME IN AND YOU'LL HAVE TWO DRAGONS RATHER THAN ONE 
AND I'LL CERTAINLY MATCH DUNCAN'S SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE NOT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT I'LL TAKE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT RIGHT 
PETER HAS DIVIDED THE DEN BUT HAS SECURED AN OFFER 
FOR THE FULL AMOUNT FROM DUNCAN BANNATYNE AND JAMES CAAN 
IT MEANS SACRIFICING FORTY FIVE PER CENT OF HIS VERY PROFITABLE COMPANY THOUGH 
AND AS EAGER AS PETER MAY BE TO WIN THE DRAGONS' BACKING 
HE'S NOT PREPARED TO GIVE IN WITHOUT A NEGOTIATION 
COULD WE NEGOTIATE FOR FIFTEEN PER CENT EQUITY EACH 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M PREPARED TO DO 
I'VE BEEN TAUGHT IN BUSINESS THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT SORT OF SITUATION 
THE BEST THING ALWAYS TO DO IS TO MEET HALFWAY YEP 
WE'RE SAYING TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YOU'RE SAYING FIFTEEN 
THAT KIND OF FEELS LIKE EIGHTEEN PER CENT EACH TO ME 
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GO WITH BOTH OF YOU 
BUT ALL I'D LIKE YOU TO DO IS IF YOU COULD BOTH COME DOWN TO FIFTEEN 
I'LL WALK OVER THERE NOW AND DO IT 
THE ENTREPRENEUR IS DIGGING HIS HEELS IN AT THIRTY PER CENT OF HIS COMPANY FIFTEEN PER CENT PER POTENTIAL INVESTOR 
THE BALL IS BACK IN THE DRAGONS' COURT 
WE'LL COME IN AT EIGHTEEN EACH 
BUT WE CAN PUT A RATCHET SYSTEM WHERE YOU CAN GET YOUR THREE PER CENT BACK FROM EACH OF US 
TO REDUCE IT TO FIFTEEN EACH 
WHAT'S THE RATCHET SYSTEM 
IF YOU DELIVER FIFTY THOUSAND THE FOLLOWING YEAR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THE YEAR AFTER 
AND ONE MILLION THE YEAR AFTER THAT 
THEN WE WILL TAKE EIGHTEEN PER CENT TODAY AND WE WILL DROP ONE PER CENT EACH YEAR PROVIDED YOU DELIVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY INCREMENTS 
AND THAT GIVES ME MY THIRTY PER CENT YEAH AND IN THREE YEARS' TIME WE'D NEED TO BE MAKING ONE MILLION PROFIT 
YOU MAKE ONE MILLION IN THE THIRD YEAR AND WE'LL EACH GIVE YOU BACK THREE PER CENT OF THE SHAREHOLDING 
DO WE HAVE OURSELVES A DEAL THEN CERTAINLY ON THOSE FIGURES 
WELL LET'S SHAKE HANDS PETER ON THAT NOTE CONGRATULATIONS 
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR HIM TWO DRAGONS TO HELP TAKE HIS BUSINESS TO WORLDWIDE SUCCESS 
PETER I'M TOTALLY PERPLEXED 
WHY HAVE YOU GIVEN AWAY SO MUCH OF YOUR COMPANY A MONEY BACK GUARANTEE AND THE BUSINESS IS FLOURISHING 
IT'S MAKING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING MILLIONS WITH THE DRAGONS' HELP 
I THINK YOU MUST BE THE FIRST PERSON TO FACE THE DRAGONS 
WHO'S GONE IN UNDERVALUING THEIR COMPANY RATHER THAN OVERVALUING IT 
WELL ALL I'D SAY IS THAT IT'S BETTER TO HAVE SEVENTY PER CENT OF A LOT 
THAN ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF A LOT LESS SO I'M VERY HAPPY 
WELL YOU'VE GOT TWO DRAGONS YOU'RE PAYING A LOT FOR THEM ALL THE BEST 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE DRAGONS TELL ENTREPRENEURS IF THEY WANT INVESTMENT AND HELP WITH THE BUSINESS 
THEY'RE BETTER OFFER A GOOD DEAL IN THE DEN 
WELL PETER MOULE TOOK THEM AT THEIR WORD AND MADE AN OFFER THEY COULDN'T REFUSE
