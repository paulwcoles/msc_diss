HEY HEY ARE YOU READY TO PLAY 
COME AND PLAY SAFE WITH THE TWEENIES 
HEY HEY WHAT DO YOU SAY 
COME AND PLAY SAFE IT'S COOL TO PLAY SAFE 
HAVE FUN AND PLAY SAFE WITH THE TWEENIES 
BE SAFE WITH THE TWEENIES CANAL 
HI FIZZ HI BELLA YOU O. K. FIZZY YOU LOOK AS IF SOMETHING'S WRONG 
NO NOTHING'S WRONG THEN WHY THE LONG FACE 
IT'S JUST THAT MAX HAS GONE TO A CANAL WITH EMMA AND HER GRANNY 
I WISH WE COULD GO TOO 
IT'S ONLY AN OLD CANAL FIZZ BUT IT'S LOVELY THERE BELLA 
YOU SEE THESE PRETTY OLD FASHIONED BOATS CHUGGING UP AND DOWN 
THE BOATS ARE CALLED NARROW BOATS 
THEY'RE LONG AND THIN SO THEY CAN TRAVEL DOWN CANALS 
PEOPLE LIVE ON THEM TOO AND PAINT THEM IN BRIGHT COLOURS LIKE THIS 
HEY WHERE ARE YOU GOING EMMA COME BACK PLEASE 
THAT'S RIGHT NOW HOLD HANDS AGAIN 
YOU SHOULD NEVER RUN ALONG THE PATH BESIDE THE CANAL 
YOU MIGHT FALL IN THE WATER OR TRIP OVER ONE OF THESE MOORING ROPES 
THEY STOP THE BOAT FROM FLOATING AWAY BUT THEY CAN BE DANGEROUS 
IF YOU TRIPPED OVER ONE YOU COULD HURT YOURSELF OR FALL INTO THE CANAL 
DUM DE DUM OH DEAR FIZZ AND BELLA DON'T LOOK VERY HAPPY 
LIKE ME WHEN I'VE LOST MY BONE 
PILL THE BEANS MA IS VISITING A CANAL AND WE WANT TO GO WITH HIM 
I'D LOVE TO GO TO A CANAL YEAH 
I LOVE FEEDING THE DUCKS DON'T YOU 
BUT WE'RE NOT STANDING RIGHT BY THE EDGE OF THE WATER WHY 
BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY TO FALL IN 
IT'S NOT LIKE THE SWIMMING POOL 
THERE ARE NO STEPS HERE SO IF YOU FALL IN IT CAN BE HARD TO GET OUT 
IT'S MUCH SAFER TO STAND WELL BACK 
ALL THE LOVELY TREES AND FIELDS 
DON'T YOU WISH YOU COULD BE BY A CANAL YES MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
BUT I'D STAND BACK FROM THE EDGE 
GLOOM AROONI HAVE YOU GOT TUMMY ACHE IT MAKES ME LOOK LIKE THAT 
NO JAKEY WE'RE JUST A BIT FED UP 
BECAUSE WE WANT TO GO TO THE CANAL AND SEE THE BOATS AND LOCKS 
LOCKS DO THEY HAVE GINORMOUS KEYS NO JAKEY 
IT'S NOT A DOOR LOCK IT'S FOR THE BOATS I WATCHED ONE WORKING ONCE 
YES A LOCK IS AN INTERESTING PLACE 
YOU SEE THAT WATER GUSHING IN OVER THERE 
IT'S LOWERING THIS BOAT DOWN SO IT CAN TRAVEL TO THE NEXT BIT OF CANAL 
BUT A LOCK IS ALSO A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE 
THAT'S WHY EMMA'S STANDING THERE OUT OF THE WAY WITH HER GRANNY 
LOOK HOW DEEP IT IS IF YOU FALL INTO A LOCK 
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OUT 
SO YOU MUST KEEP WELL AWAY FROM LOCKS 
NOW EMMA WE MUST GET A MOVE ON 
YOUR GRANDAD'S TAKING US FOR A RIDE ON HIS NARROW BOAT 
LET'S GO AND GET OUR LIFE JACKETS 
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS NOW THEY'RE HAVING A BOAT RIDE TOO 
HELLO IT'S ME JUDY HI MAX JUMP IN THE CAR AND JOIN US' 
MAX SAYS WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN HIM AND EMMA FOR THE BOAT RIDE 
YES 
RIGHT BEFORE WE SET OFF LET'S JUST REMEMBER HOW TO BE SAFE BY A CANAL 
IT'S FUN TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS EVERY DAY 
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT LAST FOREVER 
BUT KEEP IN YOUR HEAD WHAT THE TWEENIES SAID 
THEN WE'LL ALL PLAY SAFE TOGETHER 
YES WE'LL ALL PLAY SAFE TOGETHER 
CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG 
DOWN BY THE CANAL 
CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG 
WATCHING BOATS ON THE CANAL 
DON'T RUN DOWN THE PATH IT'S A RACE YOU CAN'T WIN 
STAY BACK FROM THE EDGE IN CASE YOU FALL IN 
THE LOCK IS WHERE YOU SHOULD TAKE THE MOST CARE 
IT'S FUN TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS EVERY DAY 
WE'LL ALL PLAY SAFE TOGETHER 
OMBLIBOO TOMBLIBOO KNOCK ON THE DOOR 
THE NIGHT IS BLACK 
AND THE STARS ARE BRIGHT 
AND THE SEA IS DARK AND DEEP 
BUT SOMEONE I KNOW IS SAFE AND SNUG AND THEY'RE DRIFTING OFF TO SLEEP 
ROUND AND ROUND A LITTLE BOAT NO BIGGER THAN YOUR HAND 
OUT ON THE OCEAN FAR AWAY FROM LAND 
TAKE THE LITTLE SAIL DOWN LIGHT THE LITTLE LIGHT 
THIS IS THE WAY TO THE GARDEN IN THE NIGHT
