DEEP IN SPACE LIES SUPERHERO SCHOOL 
ITS NEXT STUDENT IS BOLDLY GOING TO LEARN 
WHAT NO OTHER SUPERHERO HAS LEARNED BEFORE 
YES THIS IS THE STORY OF MATHS MAN 
HE LIKES TO KEEP IN SHAPE 
IT'S MATHS MAN 
MATHS MAN EXPECTED IN THREE TWO ONE SECONDS 
HI I'M MATHS MAN MATHEMATICAL SUPERHERO AT YOUR SERVICE 
WELCOME TO THE LEARNING POD MATHS MAN THANKS THIS IS VERA OUR FRIENDLY ON BOARD COMPUTER 
BUT WHERE'S HIS WHOLENESS HE IS EXPECTED IN THREE TWO ONE SECONDS 
DON'T JUST STAND THERE MATHS MAN TAKE THIS SORRY YOUR WHOLENESS 
WHAT IS IT 
OH IT'S JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING TO BRIGHTEN UP YOUR LEARNING POD COOL 
WELL OPEN IT MATHS MAN OH RIGHT 
HEY HEY 
OH WOW HEY HEY IT'S A PICTURE 
WHAT'S IT OF 
IT'S SOUP TINS REPEATING THEMSELVES 
SHAPES REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN 
REPEATING PATTERN 
SHALL I STICK IT UP HERE M. M. M. NO HIGHER MATHS MAN 
HIGHER MATHS MAN HOLD ON A SECOND 
I'LL JUST RIGHT 
OH JUMPING JUPITER 
TODAY'S LESSON IS ALL ABOUT PATTERNS 
WE'LL START AT THE BEGINNING EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW IS IN THE CRYSTALS OH AND MATHS MAN 
TRY NOT TO BREAK ANYTHING ELSE 
ON PLANET EARTH YOU WILL SEE PATTERNS EVERYWHERE 
HUMANS ADD PATTERNS TO MANY THINGS 
THEY THINK IT MAKES EARTH MORE BEAUTIFUL AND INTERESTING PATTERNS ARE MADE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS 
LET'S START BY LOOKING AT MAKING PATTERNS BY REFLECTING A SHAPE 
HERE IS A SHAPE IF WE REFLECTED THE SHAPE IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
WELL BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTED THE NEW SHAPE LOOKS 
CORRECT WHEN WE REFLECT A SHAPE THE SHAPE REMAINS THE SAME SIZE 
AND IT IS FLIPPED OR FOLDED OVER 
IF WE CONTINUE TO REFLECT THE SHAPE WE END UP WITH A REFLECTED PATTERN 
THE SHAPE IS REFLECTED ACROSS WAYS WHICH WE CALL 
THE PATTERN MOVES FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER 
HOWEVER WE COULD REFLECT THE SHAPE UP AND DOWN 
WHICH IS CALLED 
REFLECT OR FLIP THE SHAPE OVER THEN KEEP ON REFLECTING 
FANTASTIC LET US USE THE SAME SHAPE TO MAKE A DIFFERENT PATTERN 
INSTEAD OF REFLECTING IT WATCH THIS 
HEY YOU'RE SLIDING THAT SHAPE 
SLIDING THAT SHAPE ALONG 
CORRECT THIS WAY OF SLIDING A PATTERN ALONG IS CALLED 
TRANSLATION CORRECT MATHS MAN 
THERE ARE THREE THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN TRANSLATING A PATTERN 
FIRSTLY THE SHAPE AND SIZE ALWAYS REMAIN THE SAME 
SECONDLY THE ORIENTATION OR THE WAY THE SHAPE IS FACING 
REMAINS THE SAME 
IT'S NOT FLIPPED IT JUST SLIDES STRAIGHT ACROSS YES 
THIRDLY THE SHAPE ALWAYS SLIDES IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
IT DOESN'T TWIST OR MOVE IN A CURVE NO 
STAMPS ARE A GOOD WAY OF LOOKING AT TRANSLATIONS 
THEY SLIDE VERTICALLY 
HORIZONTALLY 
AND EVEN IN A DIAGONAL LINE 
HERE IS SOMEONE FROM PLANET EARTH WHO TRANSLATES PATTERNS 
I'M AN ARTIST AND A BOOK MAKER 
TODAY I'LL SHOW YOU HOW I MADE THE PATTERNED PAPER FOR MY NEW BOOK 
O. K. THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS TO DECIDE WHAT DESIGN YOU WANT 
IT COULD BE A BIRD 
OR A LION 
WHAT I'VE DECIDED TO USE IS THIS RUNNING FIGURE 
THIS WILL BE PRINTESS THE CHARACTER IN MY BOOK 
FOR THIS DESIGN I IMPRESSED MY PATTERN INTO A POLYSTYRENE BLOCK 
WHEN MY PRINTING BLOCK IS READY I EXPERIMENT WITH THE DESIGN 
TO SEE WHAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE 
FIRST I MARK A CROSS IN THE CORNER AT THE BACK OF THE BLOCK 
TO SHOW ME WHICH WAY UP IT GOES 
NOW I KNOW IF THE CROSS IS AT THE TOP THE FIGURE IS THE RIGHT WAY UP 
THE SQUARED PAPER HELPS TO MAKE SURE 
THAT I'VE PLACED MY BLOCK IN EXACTLY THE RIGHT PLACE 
IF I LINE UP THE RIGHT ANGLED CORNER OF MY BLOCK 
WITH THE LINES ON THE SQUARED PAPER 
I WILL ALWAYS GET A STRAIGHT LINE IN THE PATTERN WHEN IT MOVES ALONG 
THIS HELPS MAKE THE SAME TRANSLATION EACH TIME I MOVE THE BLOCK 
I CAN MOVE THE BLOCK ALONG THIS LINE ONE SQUARE AT A TIME 
MAKING A HORIZONTAL TRANSLATION 
OR I CAN MOVE THE PATTERN ALONG THIS LINE ONE SQUARE AT A TIME 
MAKING A VERTICAL TRANSLATION 
OR IT CAN MOVE ALONG LIKE THIS 
HALF A SQUARE ALONG AND ONE SQUARE DOWN 
MAKING A DIAGONAL TRANSLATION 
COUNTING THE SQUARES AND LINING UP THE RIGHT ANGLES 
MAKES SURE THAT THE PATTERN FOLLOWS A STRAIGHT LINE 
AND THAT IT IS ALWAYS EVENLY SPACED 
SEE IF YOU CAN SEE WHAT TYPE OF TRANSLATING PATTERN 
I'M MAKING FOR THIS BOOK 
TRANSLATING PATTERNS ARE EVERYWHERE LOOK AT THE FLOWERS ON THIS PAPER 
THEY ARE TRANSLATING DIAGONALLY 
THIS IS NO TIME TO WRAP PRESENTS MATHS MAN NO I'M LEARNING ABOUT REFLECTING AND TRANSLATING PATTERNS 
H. M. M. GOOD THEN YOU SHOULD FLY THROUGH THIS NEXT CHALLENGE 
READY TO HELP OUT MATHS TEAM 
OH HELLO TWO D. THREE D. GREETINGS MATHS TEAM 
HERE ARE SOME NICE PATTERNS BUT ONLY ONE IS A TRANSLATING PATTERN 
WHICH ONE 
TIME STARTS NOW 
O. K. MATHS TEAM WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I THINK IT'S A 
IT'S TRANSLATING VERTICALLY 
YAHOO YOU'RE REALLY COOL 
NLE T. UESTION WHICH ONE OF THESE PATTERNS IS NL T. REMEMBER 
IS NL TA REFLECTED PATTERN 
CAN YOU REMEMBER REFLECTIONS MATHS TEAM 
I THINK IT'S B. 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME SHAPE AND SIZE 
YA HOO OOH YOU'RE REALLY COOL 
NLE T. UESTION WHICH ONE OF THESE IS A TRANSLATING PATTERN 
FFYOU GO I THINK IT'S B. 
BECAUSE THE SHAPE IN A DOES NOT MOVE OR SLIDE IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
YOU'RE TOO COOL MATHS TEAM 
HA HA BYE 
YES ALL CORRECT 
WELL DONE MATHS MAN AS A REWARD VERA'S GOING TO TAKE YOU TO A PARTY 
EXCELLENT OH 
WHAT KIND OF PARTY A TRANSLATING PATTERN PARTY OF COURSE 
IN THIS ROOM MATHS MAN YOU WILL SEE SOME TRANSLATING PATTERNS 
SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT THEM 
WELL THERE'S THE BUNTING 
THOSE TRIANGLES ARE TRANSLATING IN A HORIZONTAL STRAIGHT LINE 
LOOK AT ALL THOSE BIRTHDAY CARDS 
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SHAPE AND SIZE AND THEY'RE TRANSLATING DIAGONALLY 
AND THOSE PAPER PLATES AND NAPKINS MAKE A NICE TRANSLATING PATTERN 
WE COULD CHANGE THAT PATTERN WATCH 
I'VE SPREAD THEM OUT 
NOW THERE'S A GAP IN BETWEEN 
OR WE COULD TRY THIS 
NOW THE PLATES ARE OVERLAPPING 
IS THAT PATTERN STILL TRANSLATING 
OF COURSE THE SHAPES ARE THE SAME SIZE THEY ARE FACING THE SAME WAY 
AND THEY ARE STILL MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE THAT'S BRILLIANT 
BACK TO THE PARTY MATHS MAN 
NO PARTY IS COMPLETE WITHOUT SOME MUSIC 
YOU PUT YOUR LEFT ARM IN YOUR LEFT ARM OUT 
IN OUT IN OUT YOU SHAKE IT ALL ABOUT 
YOU DO THE HOKEY COKEY AND YOU TURN AROUND 
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
OH HOKEY COKEY COKEY 
OH HOKEY COKEY COKEY 
OH HOKEY COKEY COKEY KNEES BENT ARMS STRETCHED 
RA RA RA 
YOUR WHOLENESS WE HAVE YET TO FINISH THE LESSON 
WE STILL HAVE THE TESSELLATION CRYSTAL YES QUITE RIGHT VERA 
THANK YOU YOUR WHOLENESS TIME FOR TESSELLATIONS I THINK MATHS MAN 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
SOME SHAPES REPEATEDLY FIT TOGETHER WITHOUT LEAVING ANY GAPS 
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE SAY THAT THE SHAPE TESSELLATES 
THESE SQUARES TESSELLATE THE PATTERN THEY MAKE IS CALLED A. 
A PARALLELOGRAM IS A FOUR SIDED SHAPE DOES IT TESSELLATE 
WELL DONE MATHS MAN IN FACT ALL QUADRILATERALS TESSELLATE 
WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR MATHS TEAM TO TRY SOME LATER 
BEFORE THEY DO HERE ARE SOME MORE TESSELLATING SHAPES 
THOSE OCTAGONS DON'T TESSELLATE THERE ARE GAPS IN BETWEEN 
WELL SPOTTED MATHS MAN BUT IF YOU FILL THE GAPS WITH SQUARES 
YOU GET AN INTERESTING TESSELLATING PATTERN 
VERA CAN YOU SHOW EXAMPLES OF TESSELLATIONS ON EARTH 
WOW 
I'VE SEEN LOTS OF PATTERNS LIKE THAT ON MY VISITS TO EARTH HAVE YOU 
DO YOU WANT TO SEE A TRULY AMAZING TESSELLATION YES PLEASE 
JUMPING METEORITES WHO DID THIS 
THIS IS THE WORK OF AN ARTIST CALLED ESCHER 
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY THE SAME SHAPES FIT TOGETHER 
TO MAKE A TESSELLATING PATTERN 
THE WORKS OF MAURITS ESCHER 
I COULD LOOK AT THIS FOR HOURS STILL NO TIME FOR THAT NOW 
READY FOR YOUR FINAL CHALLENGE ON EARTH YEAH 
I HOPE YOU REMEMBER EVERYTHING YOU LEARNT ABOUT PATTERNS GOOD LUCK 
AH 
OH 
OH HELLO I'M MATHS MAN YES I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU I HAVE YOUR CHALLENGE READY 
TILES ARE QUADRILATERALS SO THEY TESSELLATE PERFECTLY 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT TESSELLATION IS A REPEATING PATTERN WITH NO GAPS YES 
THIS PATTERN ISN'T FINISHED YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE IT 
BY WORKING OUT WHETHER IT'S MADE BY TRANSLATING OR REFLECTING THE TILES O. K. O. K. THANK YOU 
SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG 
RIGHT I'LL START WITH THIS ROW WOW LOOK 
A SHOOTING STAR 
WE'VE GOT A SHOOTING STAR AND A GAP 
TWO MORE SHOOTING STARS AND TWO GAPS ALL THE STARS IF YOU NOTICE 
THEY'RE THE SAME DESIGN SAME SIZE 
AND THEY FLY IN THE SAME DIRECTION 
THE PATTERN'S BEING REPEATED SO IT'S A TRANSLATION 
TO BE A TRANSLATION THESE MUST BE THE SAME 
PUT THESE IN THAT ONE THERE 
OH THAT'S NOT RIGHT 
TURN IT ROUND THAT'S BETTER 
THERE 
WONDERFUL YEAH 
FANTASTIC FIRST ROW COMPLETE A TRANSLATION 
WON'T TAKE LONG AT ALL SECOND ROW 
ROCKETS LOOK AT THESE TWO ROCKETS 
THEY'RE GOING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS 
THAT COULD MEAN IT'S A REFLECTION ONE WAY TO FIND OUT 
WE COULD CHECK WITH THIS MIRROR 
IF I PLACE THE MIRROR ON THE MIRROR LINE LET'S SEE 
THIS TILE SHOULD BE THE SAME AS THE REFLECTION 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK IT IS 
WITHOUT THE MIRROR YOU SEE THEY'RE FLYING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS 
AND THEY'RE THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE MIRROR LINE 
IT'S A REFLECTION SO THIS SQUARE MUST BE A REFLECTION OF THIS SQUARE 
LET'S FIND OUT 
THE TILE IN THIS SQUARE IS FLYING THE OPPOSITE WAY 
SAME DISTANCE FROM THE MIRROR LINE 
THAT'S A REFLECTION OF THAT ONE LET'S SEE WHICH ONE FITS HERE 
WE'LL TRY THIS ONE 
LET'S SEE MAKE SURE IT'S FLYING OPPOSITE THERE 
OH THIS IS EASY GET THE LAST ONE LET'S SEE IF THIS ONE WORKS 
IT'S FLYING THE OPPOSITE WAY SAME DISTANCE FROM THE MIRROR LINE 
SECOND ROW COMPLETE I'LL BE GOING HOME REALLY SOON 
RIGHT THIRD ROW 
WE'VE GOT A MOON A PLANET 
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER MOON THAT'S THE SAME AS THAT MOON 
WE'VE GOT TWO GAPS THEN A PLANET 
THAT PLANET LOOKS THE SAME AS THIS PLANET 
I WONDER IF THIS ROW'S A TRANSLATION BUT LOOK A TRANSLATION 
USING TWO DESIGNS 
SO IT GOES MOON PLANET 
MOON PLANET MOON PLANET 
THIS PLANET HAS TO BE THE SAME AS THESE NOW I NEED A MOON 
HERE'S A MOON SAME DESIGN SAME SIZE WONDERFUL 
THIS WILL COMPLETE THE ROW AND THE PATTERN WILL BE REPEATED LOVELY 
THIRD ROW COMPLETE OH H. H. THAT WAS EASY 
THAT DOES LOOK GOOD NOW MAKE THE OTHER HALF A COMPLETE REFLECTION OF THE FIRST HALF 
OH RIGHT A COMPLETE REFLECTION OH 
TO MAKE IT A REFLECTION 
ALL OF THESE HAVE TO BE FLIPPED OVER 
IT COULD TAKE ALL NIGHT 
I KNOW 
THERE FINISHED 
ALL DONE HEY HEY WELL THAT DOES LOOK GOOD 
YOU'VE WORKED REALLY HARD ON THAT MATHS MAN 
AS A REWARD YOU CAN TAKE THIS BACK FOR YOUR LEARNING POD THANK YOU 
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH THIS OF COURSE 
I KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO WITH THIS 
HEY HEY THANK YOU HEE HEE RIGHT 
UP UP AND AWAY Y. Y. 
CONGRATULATIONS MATHS MAN THANK YOU I'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU 
OH HOW ABSOLUTELY SPLENDID AND I'VE SOMETHING FOR YOU MATHS MAN 
ATTENTION 
WOULD YOU CARE FOR A CUP OF TEA MATHS MAN 
THANK YOU OH AND I'VE SOMETHING FOR YOU MATHS TEAM 
LOOK AT THE FLOORS AND THE WALLS AROUND YOU 
ARE THE PATTERNS REFLECTED OR TRANSLATED 
AND CAN YOU SEE ANY TESSELLATIONS 
HAPPY HUNTING CHEERY BYE 
HA HA HA HA HA HA
