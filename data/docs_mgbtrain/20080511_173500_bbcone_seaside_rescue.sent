WHAT DID I SAY 
WHAT DID YOU SAY 
DON'T BOTHER GOING THERE I KNOW SOMETHING BAD'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
AND IT DID 
GOOD TO KNOW THEY'RE THERE THE LIFEGUARDS 
THEY WERE PRETTY SWIFT GOT THERE PRETTY QUICKLY 
IF WE'D LEFT IT A BIT LONGER MAYBE QUITE DANGEROUS 
YOU'RE A PLONKER 
THEY DIDN'T TAKE IT THAT SERIOUSLY 
I DON'T THINK THEY REALISED 
HOW CUT OFF THEY WERE THE TIDE WAS DEEP BY THE TIME WE GOT THERE 
ONE OF THE LIFEGUARDS HAD TO SWIM THEM OUT WITH A RESCUE TUBE 
THEY COULD HAVE BEEN STUCK THERE FOR HOURS OR MAYBE IN THE WATER 
ALSO GRATEFUL THE LIFEGUARDS WERE CLOSE BY ARE THE CRICKET CASUALTIES 
KAREN'S COLLAPSE WAS CAUSED BY SEEING LUCAS HIT FOR SIX 
I FELT REALLY BAD BECAUSE I'D HIT MY OWN SON 
TO SEE HIM BLACK AND BLUE WASN'T A PRETTY SIGHT 
THANKFULLY LUCAS'S INJURIES WERE MINOR 
IT WASN'T A BAD RESULT FOR KAREN EITHER 
I WENT FROM HAVING ONE LIFEGUARD TO HAVING SIX AROUND ME 
THEY WERE ALL PRETTY GOOD LOOKING 
IT'S NOT FUNNY IS IT MATE NO 
FISHERMAN ROB HAS LEARNT A VALUABLE LESSON 
I WOULDN'T GO OUT AGAIN AFTER DRINKING IT'S A SILLY THING TO DO 
I'D LIKE TO SAY BRILLIANT BUNCH OF GUYS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SAVING ME 
THEY GAVE ME SO MUCH GRIEF WHEN I GOT BACK BUT I DESERVED IT 
COLIN AND RUTH SPENT FOUR HOURS IN A DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER AND MADE A FULL RECOVERY 
WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DIVE FOR TWENTY EIGHT DAYS' 
WE WERE MEANT TO BE DIVING A LOT OF DIVES IN CYPRUS THE FOLLOWING WEEK 
SO ALL OF THEM WERE CANCELLED 
I THINK WE'LL STAY MUCH CLOSER TO EACH OTHER 
WE'LL PROBABLY DIVE A LITTLE SHALLOWER FOR A WHILE LONGER 
WE'LL KEEP DIVING IN THE U. K. BECAUSE THE SERVICES IN THE U. K. ARE SECOND TO NONE 
THANKS TO THE GUYS FOR THEIR HARD WORK 
NEXT WEEK WHISKY BRAVO RESCUE A CASUALTY BEFORE HE BLEEDS TO DEATH
