OVER SEVENTY YEARS AGO A YOUNG WELSHMAN BOUGHT THIS MAGNIFICENT BUILDING 
AS THE BASE FOR HIS FLOURISHING CHURCH 
HIS INSPIRATION THE COMING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT 
WHICH IS BEING CELEBRATED TODAY PENTECOST SUNDAY 
WE TELL THE STORY OF GEORGE JEFFREYS THE FOUNDER OF ELIM PENTECOSTAL CHURCH 
WE MEET THE MISSIONARIES WHO HAVE MORE THAN FOOTBALL ON THEIR MIND 
AND THE FAMILY WHO CHANGED FROM SAVING MONEY TO SAVING SOULS 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY ONE KENSINGTON TEMPLE BECAME THE HEART OF ELIM PENTECOSTAL CHURCH 
TODAY THE CONGREGATION HERE AND CHURCHES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY 
WILL BE CELEBRATING THE BIRTH OF THE CHURCH AT PENTECOST 
THE DAY THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT CAME DOWN ON THE EARLY DISCIPLES 
IS CAPTURED IN THE WILLIAM BOOTH CLASSIC 
O. GOD OF BURNING CLEANSING FLAME 
IN NINETEEN OH FOUR TWO TEENAGE BOYS GEORGE AND STEPHEN JEFFREYS 
BECAME CHRISTIANS DURING THE WELSH REVIVAL 
BOTH BECAME ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH 
BUT IT WAS GEORGE WHO STOOD OUT TO THE MINISTER OF SILOH CHAPEL 
GEORGE WAS SUPERIOR TO OTHER LADS THERE WAS A CHARACTER IN HIS FACE 
BOTH UNDERWENT AN EVANGELICAL CONVERSION 
AND THAT PARTICULAR PART OF THE VALLEY 
WAS THE MOST WIDELY REPORTED SECTION OF THE REVIVAL AT THE BEGINNING 
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WERE CONVERTED 
DURING THAT EARLY PERIOD OF THE REVIVAL 
AROUND THE SAME TIME ANOTHER NEW MOVEMENT MADE ITS WAY INTO THE VALLEY 
PENTECOSTAL CHURCHES FROM AMERICA BEGAN SPRINGING UP WITH THEIR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE OF WORSHIP 
THIS WAS NOT A LET'S MEET FOR ONE HOUR LET'S PREACH FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES 
LET'S DO A HYMN SANDWICH AND LET'S ALL GO HOME TO HAVE SUNDAY LUNCH 
THIS WAS SOMEWHERE WHERE 
PEOPLE ACTUALLY EXPECTED TO ENCOUNTER GOD FOR THEMSELVES 
IN VERY POWERFUL AND PROFOUND WAYS 
THIS WAS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAME AND INITIAL EVIDENCE 
SPEAKING IN OTHER TONGUES AS THE SPIRIT GAVE UTTERANCE 
WAS THE SIGNIFICANT MARK OF PENTECOSTALISM 
AT FIRST GEORGE WASN'T ASSOCIATED WITH THE PENTECOSTALS 
IN FACT HE SPOKE AGAINST THEM 
BUT STEPHEN'S SON EDWARD WAS ONLY A YOUNG BOY 
AND HE WENT ON HOLIDAY INTO WEST WALES WHERE HE MET PENTECOSTALS 
HE CAME BACK HOME AND HE'D BEEN SPEAKING IN TONGUES 
MOTHER DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL 
BUT WHEN THEY SAW THE TRANSFORMATION OF THIS YOUNG LAD ONLY ABOUT TEN YEARS OF AGE 
THEY SAW THE TRANSFORMATION EVEN IN HIM 
THEY WERE QUITE IMPRESSED AND BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE THING MORE SERIOUSLY 
AND THEN THEY THREW IN THEIR LOT WITH THESE EARLY PENTECOSTALS IN SOUTH WALES 
THE JEFFREYS BROTHERS PREACHED UP AND DOWN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND MADE QUITE AN IMPACT 
ONE VISITOR WROTE 
MR. GEORGE JEFFREYS IS A FLUENT SPEAKER WITH A GOOD DELIVERY 
HE SPEAKS AS A WELL EDUCATED MAN AND IS INTENSELY EARNEST 
EAGER TO FIND OUT THE REASON FOR SUCH AN EARLY MORNING 
GEORGE WENT FROM TOWN TO TOWN NOBODY WOULD KNOW WHO HE WAS 
HE WOULD GO AND HAVE A MEETING IN A SMALL BUILDING SOMEWHERE 
WITHIN A FEW DAYS THE BUILDING WOULD BE PACKED WITH PEOPLE 
THERE WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH ROOM TO ACCOMMODATE THEM 
GEORGE WENT INTO BINGLEY HALL AND PACKED IT WITH FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE 
DURING THE NINE WEEKS HE WAS THERE 
THEY RECORDED SOMETHING LIKE TEN THOUSAND REGISTERED CONVERTS 
HOW DID THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH REACT TO THE PENTECOSTAL MOVEMENT HERE 
PENTECOSTALISM WAS A RUDE AWAKENING 
IT WAS UNTIDY IT WAS UNUSUAL 
IT WAS FILLED WITH MYSTERY AND NEW FORMS OF WORSHIP 
SOME OF IT WENT SLIGHTLY TO THE EDGE AND OVER 
SO ESTABLISHED CHURCHES DIDN'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT 
THERE WAS A WHOLE RANGE OF RESPONSES FROM DEMONISING PENTECOSTALISM AS 
ONE GREAT QUOTE THE LAST VOMIT OF SATAN 
RIGHT THROUGH TO SUSPICION AND HOLDING IT AT ARM'S LENGTH 
FROM THE EARLIEST STAGE OF PENTECOSTALISM 
IT WAS HARD TO RESIST THE FACT THAT SOMETHING VERY POWERFUL WAS TAKING PLACE 
RIGHT IN THE LIFE OF THE CHURCH IN THE U. K. 
BUT GEORGE WASN'T SATISFIED WITH JUST TRAVELLING FROM TOWN TO TOWN PREACHING 
HE WANTED TO SET DOWN ROOTS FOR HIS CONVERTS 
AND SET UP A PERMANENT CHURCH 
SO IN BELFAST IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN HE FORMED ELIM EVANGELISTIC BAND 
GEORGE JEFFREYS WAS NEVER A ONE NIGHT STAND PREACHER 
HE FELT THAT PEOPLE NEEDED A SUSTAINED MINISTRY 
A LOT OF THESE WERE YOUNG PEOPLE 
THEY KNEW SOME OF THE SONGS AND HYMNS 
LOTS OF PEOPLE WENT TO CHURCH BUT THERE WAS NO SYSTEMATIC TEACHING 
AND HE WANTED TO INSTIL THAT 
PARTICULARLY BRINGING IN THE PENTECOSTAL SIDE AS WELL 
BUT DOING BASIC TEACHING 
THE WHOLE JEFFREYS FAMILY BEGAN PREACHING YOUNG 
A TRADITION THAT CONTINUES TO THE PRESENT DAY 
THIS IS THE GATHERING 
WHERE EVERY YEAR TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YOUNG ELIM PENTECOSTALS MEET 
TO PREACH PRAY AND PRAISE 
THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE HERE IS AMAZING AND IT'S JUST EXCITING TO SEE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WON OVER BY GOD 
AND JUST ON FIRE FOR GOD 
YOU FEEL ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LIFE OF THE CHURCH 
THEY'RE ENCOURAGED TO TAKE THINGS ON THEMSELVES TO REALLY LIVE A FULL LIFE FOR GOD 
WHEN YOU GO IN THE CHURCHES AFTER THESE EVENTS YOU'LL BE ON A HIGH 
IT WON'T JUST BE THE YOUNG PEOPLE THE CHURCH IS WITH THEM 
IT MAKES AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT ON THE CHURCH AND THEREFORE ON THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE 
THAT MOST OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE COME FROM 
YOU KIND OF COME AWAY FROM THESE WEEKENDS THINKING 
I REALLY LOVE JESUS AND REALLY WANT TO GO OUT THERE AND DO SOMETHING 
BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE GOD 
SO I WANT TO EXPERIENCE GOD IN MY DAY TO DAY LIFE 
JESUS JESUS 
I THINK IF GEORGE JEFFREYS WAS TO COME TO ONE OF OUR EVENTS TODAY 
IT WOULD LOOK VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT THE EVENTS WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE IN HIS DAY 
BUT HE WOULD ACTUALLY DO IT THIS WAY IF HE WAS AROUND TODAY I'M SURE 
BECAUSE HE WAS A COMMUNICATOR 
AND HE LOVED TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIS AUDIENCE 
WITH THE MESSAGE THAT HE CARRIED 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TODAY 
GEORGE WANTED TO TRAIN PASTORS FOR HIS EXPANDING CHURCH 
SO IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE HE FOUNDED THE ELIM BIBLE COLLEGE IN CLAPHAM 
WHICH IS NOW REGENTS THEOLOGICAL COLLEGE IN NANTWICH 
THESE WERE THE GROUP THAT DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION 
ANY OTHER GROUPS AROUND AT THE TIME OF JESUS 
MARCUS AND WENDY PAWSEY ARE IN THEIR FIRST YEAR OF A THEOLOGY DEGREE 
THEY GAVE UP HIGH PRESSURED JOBS TO MOVE HERE WITH THEIR FAMILY 
TWO YEARS AGO I HAD A PORTFOLIO OF CUSTOMERS AND I JOINED ANOTHER BANK AS A FINANCIAL ADVISOR 
IT'S IN A VERY NICE AREA I WAS RIGHT OPPOSITE THE RITZ IN MAYFAIR 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY VISIT US HERE 
REALLY ARE QUITE ASTONISHED BY THE ACTS OF WHAT WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE 
BECAUSE IN COMPARISON 
OBVIOUSLY WE SOLD OUR HOUSE AND GAVE UP THE JOBS TO BE AT COLLEGE 
AND HERE WE ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT IN THE BIGGEST ACCOMMODATION 
YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE WERE QUITE A LOT OF THESE HIGH PRIESTS 
IT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUT IT'S A LOT BETTER 
BECAUSE IT DOES ALLOW YOU TO LOOK AT YOUR LIFE A BIT DIFFERENTLY 
I THINK WE'RE DOING THE WORK THAT GOD HAS CALLED US TO DO 
AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO CHASE OTHER THINGS IN LIFE 
WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS FROM ALL ACROSS THE WORLD 
WHO TRAIN AND PREPARE HERE TO LIVE EFFECTIVE CHRISTIAN LIVES 
SOME BECOME SOCIAL WORKERS SCHOOLTEACHERS PASTORS IN CHURCHES 
SOME BECOME MISSIONARIES 
AND ALL OF THEM WE BELIEVE MAKE A BIG CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COMMUNITY 
WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW WE WOULD COPE WITH MOVING AWAY FROM FAMILY BUT ALSO HOW RHYS AND BEN WOULD COPE 
ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT MOVING HERE IS YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A COMMUNITY 
SO THEY CAN GO OUT AND HAVE A GAME OF POOL 
THERE ARE VARIOUS EVENTS THAT ARE HOSTED HERE AT THE COLLEGE 
THAT THEY CAN TAKE PART IN AND REALLY ENJOY 
ALTHOUGH WE'VE TAKEN THEM AWAY FROM THE FAMILY AUNTS AND UNCLES 
THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH SURROUNDED BY OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN INTEREST IN THEM WHICH IS REALLY GOOD 
I WOULD SAY IT'S DEFINITELY DEEPENED MY FAITH 
AND MADE ME REALISE THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER OPINIONS OUT THERE WITHIN THE CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT 
THAT I HADN'T NECESSARILY COME ACROSS BEFORE 
THE PROSPECTS AT THE END OF COLLEGE IS THAT WE WANT TO WORK FOR GOD AND BE IN THE MINISTRY FULL TIME 
BUT WHETHER IT BE THE PASTOR OF A CHURCH WHO KNOWS 
I'M SURE GEORGE JEFFREYS WOULD BE VERY EXCITED 
ABOUT HOW HIS COLLEGE HAS DEVELOPED AND GROWN OVER THESE LAST EIGHTY YEARS 
WE STILL CONTINUE HIS ORIGINAL VISION 
OF PREPARING AND TRAINING WOMEN AND MEN TO LIVE FULFILLING LIVES 
AND LIVES OF SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY LIVE 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY ONE GEORGE JEFFREYS ACQUIRED THIS BUILDING WHICH WAS THEN KNOWN AS HORBURY CHAPEL 
HE RENAMED THE BUILDING KENSINGTON TEMPLE AND IT BECAME THE HOME OF ELIM PENTECOSTAL CHURCH 
IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THE TEMPLE WAS KNOWN AS THE PHYSICIAN'S CHURCH 
DUE TO THE NUMBER OF HEALINGS PERFORMED HERE 
TODAY IT'S TAKING ITS MISSIONARY WORK OUT TO THE MASSES VIA FOOTBALL 
THE NEW HOPE COACHING ACADEMY TRAINS LOCAL PEOPLE TO BE FOOTBALL COACHES 
WORKING WITH CHILDREN IN THE COMMUNITY 
WELL WE SET UP NEW HOPE IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
AND BASICALLY THE IDEA OF SETTING IT UP WAS TO HAVE A SOCIAL OUTPOST 
WHERE WE COULD GET INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY 
GET INVOLVED WITH YOUNG PEOPLE GET INVOLVED IN SCHOOLS 
THE ACADEMY SEEMED THE PERFECT WAY TO DO THAT 
WE HAVE A FOOTBALL CLUB NOW THAT WE SET UP WE HAVE THREE TEAMS 
WE'RE WORKING WITH LOTS OF FAMILIES WHICH BUILDS RELATIONSHIPS 
WHICH LINKS BACK TO THE CHURCH SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WE DO THERE 
IT'S THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO EXTEND RELATIONSHIPS BEYOND THE CHURCH WALLS 
AND WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE ACADEMY IS IT BASICALLY TO GET CONVERTS INTO THE CHURCH 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK WHY IS THE CHURCH DOING A FOOTBALL ACADEMY 
I JUST SAY SIMPLY BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE INVOLVED 
WE WANT TO BE AN ACTIVE PART OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO BE EFFECTIVE 
IF WE CAN STOP YOUNG PEOPLE FROM GOING INTO GANGS AND CRIME AND DRUGS 
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED 
BASICALLY IT'S TO BE A PRACTICAL WITNESS IN SOCIETY 
I'LL USE YOU IN A MINUTE YOU INVOLVE THEM ALL AT THE START 
THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PLAYERS STANDING AROUND 
I LOVE FOOTBALL 
WHEN YOU'RE RELATING WITH THE KIDS IT REALLY HELPS IT HELPS ME AS WELL 
IT MAKES ME FEEL I AM GIVING SOMETHING TO PEOPLE COS I HAVE SOMETHING IN MY HEART AS WELL 
A LOT OF THESE KIDS COME FROM DIFFERENT FAITH BACKGROUNDS OR NO FAITH BACKGROUND 
HOW DO YOU ENCOMPASS THAT 
WE'RE ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS 
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO LET YOUR LIFE DEMONSTRATE CHRIST 
IT'S NOT THE PREACHING IT'S YOUR LIFE 
THE COMMITMENT WE MAKE TO THOSE CHILDREN WHATEVER THEIR BACKGROUND 
WE SAY WE'RE HERE FOR YOU WE SUPPORT YOU 
THAT TO ME IS CHRIST 
AND THEY HAD TURNED FROM IDOLS TO SERVE THE LIVING AND TRUE GOD 
AT THE TIME OF GEORGE JEFFREYS' DEATH IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO 
OVER THREE HUNDRED ELIM CHURCHES HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED 
AND TO THIS DAY HIS LEGACY LIVES ON 
THE APOSTLES' DEFINITION OF CONVERSION IS VERY CLEAR 
HIS PASSION FOR EVANGELISM AND WINNING CONVERTS TO CHRIST 
I THINK THAT'S HIS LEGACY 
HE WASN'T INTERESTED SO MUCH AS ESTABLISHING A DEMONINATION 
HE WANTED MEN AND WOMEN TO BE CONFRONTED WITH A LIVING CHRIST 
WHO HE HAD FOUND AS A YOUNG LAD 
IN THE EARLY DAYS RIGHT INTO THE NINETEEN THIRTIES FORTIES FIFTIES 
PENTECOSTALISM IN THE U. K. WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE 
BUT BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN THIS VERY POWERFUL INFLUX OF BLACK CHRISTIANS IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS 
AND WITH IT A WAVE OF PENTACOSTALISM 
WHICH HAS REFRESHED THE CHURCH IN THE U. K. 
STATISTICS TELL US THAT BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE THERE COULD BE ONE BILLION PENTACOSTALS AROUND THE WORLD 
HALLELUJAH 
THE WORLDWIDE PENTACOSTAL CHURCH IS ENJOYING A GROWTH RATE 
THAT IS THE ENVY OF SOME OF ITS MORE TRADITIONAL COUNTERPARTS 
BUT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE PASSION AND ENERGY OF ITS WORSHIP 
IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY IT'S SO POPULAR 
ON THE MOUNTAIN MY GOD SPOKE 
OUT OF HIS MOUTH CAME FIRE AND SMOKE 
IN THE VALLEY ON MY KNEES 
I ASKED THE LORD TO HAVE MERCY PLEASE YEAH 
JORDAN'S RIVER CHILLY AND COLD 
IT CHILLED MY BODY BUT NOT MY SOUL 
IT'S ALL AROUND ME 
IT'S SO SO FINE 
I ASKED THE LORD IF IT'S ALL MINE 
OH EVERY TIME I FEEL THE SPIRIT 
MOVING IN MY HEART I PRAY I WILL PRAY 
EVERY TIME I FEEL THE SPIRIT FEEL THE SPIRIT 
MOVING IN MY HEART I'LL PRAY 
CLAP YOUR HANDS COME ON HE SAID CLAP YOUR HANDS COME ON 
PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER 
PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER UH 
OOH EVERY TIME 
EVERY TIME LORD 
I FEEL THE SPIRIT 
MOVING MOVING MOVING IN MY HEART 
OH IT MAKES ME WANNA DANCE 
IT MAKES ME WANNA DANCE 
EVERY TIME I FEEL THE SPIRIT 
I FEEL THE SPIRIT 
EVERY TIME I FEEL THE SPIRIT 
I FEEL THE SPIRIT FEEL THE SPIRIT 
OOH MAN I FEEL 
FEEL THE SPIRIT MOVING ALL OVER ME 
HEY HEY HEY HEY HE E. E. Y. 
EVERY TIME I FEEL THE SPIRIT 
WHOA A A AH 
EVERY TIME I FEEL THE SPIRIT 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
WHOAH YEAH 
NEXT WEEK I'M IN BEAUTIFUL NORTHUMBERLAND 
WHERE I'LL BE EXPLORING THE COUNTY'S HISTORY AND TRADITIONS 
THERE'S MUSIC FROM HEXHAM ABBEY 
BARBARA DICKSON SINGS ONE OF HER FAVOURITE HYMNS HERE ON HOLY ISLAND 
HOPE YOU CAN JOIN ME THEN
