I WAS BORN IN SALISBURY 
TILL I WAS FIFTEEN I LIVED IN THIS TINY COTTAGE 
THE VAST CATHEDRAL INFORMS MY EARLIEST MEMORIES 
SALISBURY SPIRE IS THE HIGHEST IN ENGLAND 
NARROW STREETS NEARBY LEAD THROUGH ANCIENT GATEWAYS 
TO THE MAIN PART OF THE CITY 
WELL MY HEARTBEAT IS RUNNING WILD 
BECAUSE OF YOU MY PROBLEM CHILD 
IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES I WENT TO SCHOOL 
IN THE WALLED CLOSE THAT SURROUNDS THE CATHEDRAL 
FIRST OF ALL HERE WHERE I THREW UP HALF A POUND OF BUTTER THAT I'D DRUNK FOR BREAKFAST 
HAPPY DAYS I WAS LITERALLY IN THE SHADOW OF THE SPIRE 
THEN I WENT HERE TO THE CATHEDRAL SCHOOL IN THE FORMER BISHOP'S PALACE 
TO HAVE SPENT SO MANY YEARS IN THIS PLACE WAS A SINGULAR PRIVILEGE 
IT WAS TO BE SUBJECTED TO A DIET OF ARCHITECTURAL PERFECTION 
PSALM TWENTY THREE ARRANGED BY HOWARD GOODALL 
VERGERS A PLATOON OF GODLY MINDERS WHO ARE NOT ORDAINED 
OPEN THE CATHEDRAL AT SIX HUNDRED THIRTY EVERY MORNING 
NOBODY HERE A REAL PRIVILEGE BEING THE FIRST PERSON THROUGH THE DOOR 
BEGINNING TO BRING THE PLACE BACK TO LIFE IT'S BEEN ASLEEP OVERNIGHT 
WE'RE WAKING THE GIANT IT'S A VERY FRIENDLY GIANT 
BIT BY BIT BITS START TO STIR THINGS START TO COME ALIVE 
AS EACH PART OF THE CATHEDRAL OPENS SO WE PREPARE FOR INDIVIDUALS' NEEDS 
THIS IS THE DOOR THE CHORISTERS COME THROUGH FOR THEIR MORNING PRACTICE 
I MAY NOT HAVE LEARNED TO BE A CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN I MAY NOT HAVE LEARNED PIETY 
I MAY NOT HAVE LEARNED TO APPRECIATE SACRED DIRGES 
BUT I DID DEVELOP A PREOCCUPATION GOING ON AN OBSESSION WITH BUILDINGS 
DESPITE WHAT THEY WERE USED FOR DESPITE WHAT THEY REPRESENTED 
THINK IT OVER WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID 
WHAT THEY REPRESENTED WAS THE DESICCATION AND SNOBBERY OF THE CLERGY 
IN THOSE DAYS CLERICS TENDED TO BE BELIEVERS 
THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A PLACE TO WORK IT'S A WAY OF LIFE 
THAT GIVES THEM MORE THAN JUST A SENSE OF SATISFACTION IN THE JOB THAT THEY DO 
IT GIVES THEM A REAL SENSE OF AWE AND WONDER 
IT'S NOT QUITE LIKE GOING TO WORK IN A SHOP IN THE HIGH STREET 
SO WE GO FROM MEDIEVAL SPLENDOUR 
AND VICTORIAN KEYS 
TO TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY 
AND OUR MODERN TOUCH SCREEN DIGITAL COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT OPERATES OUR SOUND SYSTEM 
THE SPIRE WAS AT ONCE EVERYDAY AND WONDERFUL 
I BOTH TOOK IT FOR GRANTED AND MARVELLED AT IT 
FAMILIARITY IN THIS INSTANCE BRED DELIGHT 
A HALLUCINATORY CLARITY 
VERTIGINOUS DELIRIUM 
WHEN I ENCOUNTERED GUSTAV FLAUBERT'S DICTUM IT MIGHT EQUALLY HAVE BEEN ANDY WARHOL'S 
THAT IF YOU STARE AT ANYTHING LONG ENOUGH IT BECOMES FANTASTICAL 
I THOUGHT OF THE SPIRE 
MAINLY BECAUSE I HAD STARED AT IT SO LONG 
HOWEVER I HAD STARED AT IT BECAUSE IT IS FANTASTICAL NOT TO MAKE IT SO NOT TO TRANSFORM IT 
IT TRANSFORMED ME JUST AS IT WAS MEANT TO 
THE SPIRE IS ASTONISHING 
BUT THEN ASTONISHMENT WAS ITS PURPOSE 
FOR ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS IT WAS THE TALLEST MAN MADE STRUCTURE IN THESE ISLANDS 
WELL LONG TALL SALLY SHE'S BUILT SWEET 
SHE GOT EVERYTHING THAT UNCLE JOHN NEEDS OH BABY 
YEAH EH BABY WOOH OOH OOH 
BABY HAVING ME SOME FUN TONIGHT 
ON AND OFF I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE SPIRE FOR THIRTY YEARS 
I STARTED ON THE CATHEDRAL IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE IT'S A BIG OLD PLACE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
IT'S IMPROVED NOW TO WHEN I FIRST COME UP 
IT USED TO BE A DIRTY PLACE FULL OF PIGEONS NOW IT'S ALL CLEAN 
HERE YOU'RE ABOUT TWO FIFTY F. T. UP 
AND YOU'VE GOT A N. O. T. H. E. R. ONE EIGHTY SEVEN I THINK IT IS TO GO ON FROM HERE 
TO THE WEATHER DOOR THEN WE GO OUTSIDE THE WEATHER DOOR WHICH IS PROBABLY ANOTHER FORTY F. T. 
O. K. YOU ALL READY 
WE'RE ONTO THE DODGY PART OF THE JOB NOW 
RIGGING THIS UP ONCE THIS IS RIGGED UP EVERYONE SHOULD BE SAFE 
HOW OLD ARE YOU FIFTY 
AND I'M SIXTY TWO AND YOU MAKE ME DO ALL THE RUNNING ABOUT I KNOW 
ON THE TOP OF THE SPIRE PEOPLE SAY THEY CAN FEEL MOVEMENT 
BUT I'VE NEVER FELT MOVEMENT WHEN I'VE BEEN UP THERE 
PEOPLE HAVE GOT THIS IMAGINATION THAT EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT BELOW 
IT'S NOT IT'S JUST SMALLER 
ALL RIGHT 
I CAN'T HOOK MYSELF ON COS MY BLOODY CHAIN'S DROPPED UNDERNEATH MY BELT 
NEVER MIND IT'S ALL RIGHT I'VE GOT TO MOVE ROUND AND LET YOU ON A BIT 
WE'RE CHANGING THE WARNING LAMPS 
THE WARNING LIGHTS TO KEEP AIRCRAFT AWAY FROM THE TOP OF THE SPIRE 
THERE WAS A STORY THAT DURING THE WAR THE GERMANS NEVER BOMBED IT 
BECAUSE IT WAS A BEACON WHETHER THAT'S TRUE OR NOT I DON'T KNOW 
IT IS A BIG CHIMNEY OR AN UPSIDE DOWN MEGAPHONE 
ONE DOESN'T KNOW IF THE PEOPLE INSIDE ARE SPEAKING TO GOD 
OR GOD IS SPEAKING TO THEM THROUGH A MEGAPHONE 
THE SPIRE IS BEACON SACRED SIGN INSPIRATION 
WHICH WORD CONTAINS WITHIN IT THE WORD SPIRE 
THAT HOWEVER IS A HAPPY COINCIDENCE THE TWO DO NOT SHARE A COMMON ROOT 
I BEG YOUR PARDON 
I NEVER PROMISED YOU A ROSE GARDEN 
ALONG WITH THE SUNSHINE OW 
THERE'S GOT TO BE A LITTLE RAIN SOMETIME 
UNLUCKY MAN THAT COULD BE A FATAL INCISION 
THE PAST LIKE THE POOR IS ALWAYS WITH US 
THE EXTENT OF THE INHABITED PAST AROUND SALISBURY IS GREATER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN EUROPE 
JUST FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE 
THIS IS WHERE BRITISH ARCHAEOLOGY WAS BORN IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
OUT OF CURIOSITY ABOUT THE PAST 
A TASTE FOR THE PAST IS NOT ELEMENTAL IT HAS TO BE LEARNT 
AS A CHILD GROWING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS ANCIENTNESS 
I WAS PERSISTENTLY ENJOINED TO AWE TO HUMILITY 
TO PRIDE IN THE PRECIOUS PATRIMONY ON MY DOORSTEP 
AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT FOR A LONG TIME I FAILED I JUST DIDN'T GET IT 
THEN WHEN I WAS EIGHT A GARDENER GRAZED HIMSELF ON A ROSE THORN 
HE CONTRACTED TETANUS HE DIED LOCKJAW 
THE INQUEST FASCINATED ME 
THE ROSE WAS ADJUDGED TO HAVE BEEN A VECTOR OF TETANUS 
BECAUSE OF THE BODIES BURIED BENEATH THE GARDEN WHERE IT GREW 
THE VERY EARTH WAS CONTAMINATED BY THE CHEMICAL GHOSTS OF MILLENNIA 
THE PAST WAS PRESENT THE DEAD WERE WITH US STILL 
AND ADDING TO THEIR NUMBER RECRUITING WITH THEIR LONG DECOMPOSITION 
I BEGAN TO GET IT 
BUT I STILL DIDN'T GET STONEHENGE ONLY ELEVEN MILES FROM SALISBURY 
STILL HAVEN'T IT'S IN THE WRONG PLACE 
WHY IS IT SITUATED IN A DECLIVITY 
IT OUGHT TO BE ON THE HORIZON 
SO CLOSE TO HEAVEN 
THE SUCCESSIVE CULTURES WHICH INHABITED WILTSHIRE 
HAD USED AND REUSED THE SAME UPLAND SITES 
AND THEY USED AND REUSED THE SAME STONES 
PROGRESS WOULD ONLY BE HAMPERED BY PRESERVING FORMER CULTURES' ARTEFACTS 
OUR ANCESTORS LOOKED FORWARD 
OLD SARUM IS AN EARTHWORK TO THE IMMEDIATE NORTH OF SALISBURY 
IT WAS AN IRON AGE FORTRESS A ROMAN ENCAMPMENT 
A NORMAN GARRISON 
SALISBURY'S FIRST CATHEDRAL SAINT OSMUND'S WAS BUILT HERE IN ONE THOUSAND SEVENTY EIGHT 
AND HERE CHURCH AND ARMY LIVED SIDE BY SIDE 
LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT 
ONE GOD NOW AND FOR EVER 
THE CHURCH AND THE ARMY TO THIS DAY THE DEFINING TRADES OF THIS CORNER OF ENGLAND 
THEY HAVE MUCH IN COMMON THE OBLIGATIONS OF FIDELITY DUTY SERVICE 
THE PREOCCUPATIONS WITH RANK KIT CEREMONIAL 
BUT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TWO AT OLD SARUM WERE FAR FROM CORDIAL 
THE GARRISON WHICH HAD THE CROWN'S PATRONAGE GOT THE UPPER HAND 
IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY THE CHURCH DECIDED TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK 
TO MOVE TO THE VALLEY 
ONCE UPON A TIME THE BISHOP AT OLD SARUM DECIDED TO MOVE HIS CATHEDRAL TO A NEW PLACE 
SO A SOLDIER STOOD ON THE RAMPARTS OF THE CASTLE AND SHOT AN ARROW 
IT HIT A DEER AND WHERE THE DEER FINALLY FELL WAS THE PLACE WHERE THE NEW CATHEDRAL WOULD BE BUILT 
I WOULDN'T DREAM OF TELLING MY KIDDIES SUCH MELTONS 
THE CHURCH REALISED THE POTENTIAL OF A FRESH START ON A FRESH SITE 
IT UNDERSTOOD THAT ITS SPIRITUAL POWER AND TEMPORAL AUTHORITY 
WOULD BE REPRESENTED BY WHAT IT BUILT THINK BIG 
THE CATHEDRAL IS FOUR FORTY NINE F. T. LONG 
AND THE NAVE EIGHTY FIVE F. T. HIGH 
IT WAS BUILT USING SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TONS OF STONE 
IDEAL FOR GOOD ACOUSTICS 
WHEN I PLAY THE ORGAN HERE 
I HAVE THIS SENSE THAT I'M PART OF A BIGGER TRADITION 
WORSHIP HAS GONE ON HERE FOR HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
AND THE ORGAN IS STILL THE BEST INSTRUMENT I BELIEVE 
FOR LEADING WORSHIP 
IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO BE ABLE TO PLAY IT EVERY DAY 
I SPENT MANY YEARS IN COLD CHURCHES IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND PRACTISING 
BUT NOW I CAN PRACTISE ON THIS AT ANY TIME 
WHAT IT DOES IT GIVES ME A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT SOUNDS 
IT GIVES ME SOUNDS FROM THE HIGHEST LIKE THIS 
TO THE LOWEST LIKE THIS 
WITH EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN 
LISTEN TO THE BEGINNING OF THIS VIDOR TOCCATA 
IMAGINE THIS AT THE END OF A FRENCH CATHEDRAL SERVICE OR AT THE END OF YOUR WEDDING 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY SUPERB BUT YOU MUSTN'T PLAY IT TOO FAST OR ELSE IT COMES HORRIBLY UNSTUCK 
SO HERE GOES LISTEN TO THIS 
AND THE REAL EXCITEMENT 
IS WAITING FOR THE PEDALS 
STEADY 
HERE COME THE PEDALS 
ISN'T THAT SUPERB 
IT'S ALL TO DO WITH FULFILMENT OF EXPECTATION 
CAN HOLINESS BE MEASURED IN UNITS OF BREADTH AND HEIGHT AND VOLUME 
QUITE POSSIBLY 
BUT A CATHEDRAL IS MORE THAN A REPRESENTATION 
OF ECCLESIASTICAL MIGHT IT IS THE CHURCH 
JUST AS THE EUCHARIST IS TO A COMMUNICANT CHRISTIAN 
THE BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST AND NOT A MERE SYMBOL 
RITES AND RAFTERS FAITH AND STONE 
INEFFABLE MYSTERIES AND DELICATE TRACERY 
COALESCE IN SACRED ONENESS 
APPARENTLY 
THE SUN IS OUT THE SKY IS BLUE 
THERE'S NOT A CLOUD TO SPOIL THE VIEW 
THE MOVE TO THE VALLEY WAS IN THE WORDS OF THE CONTEMPORARY CHRONICLER HENRI DAVRANCHE 
A MOVE TO THE FREEDOM OF A PLACE OF AMBROSIAL SWEETNESS 
FROM THE OPPRESSION OF A HILL OF ILL REPUTE 
MAYBE THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT 
AND IT'S RAINING 
THE SITE WAS NOT QUITE THE PARADISE HENRI DAVRANCHE CLAIMED 
IT WAS ACTUALLY A MARSH 
NOW THERE'S A CHANGE ROUND IN THE FIELD 
TO THIS DAY THE FIELD SOUTH WEST OF THE CATHEDRAL WHERE I WAS ROUTINELY HUMILIATED AT CRICKET 
BEARS THE NAME MARSH CLOSE 
AND HE'S CAUGHT HIM 
IT COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN A MORE INHOSPITABLE TERRAIN 
FOR A LARGE BUILDING 
AND ENGLAND ARE ALL OUT FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THREE 
IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE CATHEDRAL'S VERY SITE WAS DETERMINED BY ITS PROXIMITY TO THE RIVERS 
WHICH FORMED THE ONLY EFFECTIVE MEANS OF TRANSPORTING BUILDING MATERIALS 
IT IS EQUALLY PROBABLE THAT CERTAIN OF THE RIVERS WERE CANALISED 
TO FACILITATE THIS TRANSPORT 
NATURE DOESN'T DO STRAIGHT LINES 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE MUCH LATER WATER MEADOWS 
A MARVEL OF PRIMITIVE HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING 
WERE DEVISED NOT ONLY TO PROVIDE PASTURE FOR THE SACRED COWS 
BUT TO MINIMISE THE RISK OF FLOODING 
WELL I HEARD THE NEWS THERE'S GOOD ROCKING TONIGHT 
WELL I HEARD THE NEWS THERE'S GOOD ROCKING TONIGHT 
THE AREA AROUND SALISBURY'S PREDOMINANTLY CHALK 
SAVE IN ITS DEEP BED FORM WHICH IS CALLED CLUNCH 
CHALK IS AN INDIFFERENT BUILDING MATERIAL 
IT ERODES IT CRUMBLES 
NO ONE WOULD EVER HAVE DREAMT OF BUILDING A CATHEDRAL OUT OF IT 
FLINT THE OTHER LOCAL MATERIAL WAS SELDOM USED OTHER THAN DECORATIVELY 
THE REASON MANY MORE ANCIENT CHURCHES THAN ANCIENT HOUSES 
HAVE SURVIVED IN AREAS OF FRIABLE BUILDING MATERIALS IS THAT THE CHURCHES WERE PARAMOUNT STRUCTURES 
THEY HAD MONEY THROWN AT THEM 
THEY WERE NOT RELIANT ON IMMEDIATELY LOCAL MATERIALS 
FUTHER PRESTIGE ATTACHED TO BUILDINGS MADE OF DISTANT MATERIALS 
THEY BOASTED OF HAULAGE A LUXURY ENJOYED BY GOD AND HIS AGENTS ON EARTH 
THE CATHEDRAL'S STRUCTURAL MATERIAL WAS QUARRIED AT CHILMARK 
TWELVE MILES WEST OF SALISBURY AND THE NEAREST POINT TO THE CITY 
THAT OOLITIC LIMESTONE THE MOST ENDURING OF BUILDING STONES OCCURS 
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO TWELVE MILES WAS FAR AWAY 
CHILMARK IS BESIDE THE RIVER NADDER 
SO NAMED AS IT CURLS LIKE A SNAKE 
ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE AVON IS TWO HUNDRED M. FROM THE CATHEDRAL 
THE CHILMARK STONE IS STRUCTURAL 
THE PREDOMINANT DECORATIVE MATERIAL IS PURBECK MARBLE 
WHICH ACTUALLY ISN'T MARBLE BUT A CRYSTALLISED LIMESTONE CAPABLE OF BEING POLISHED 
RECOMMENDED FOR INTERIOR USE ONLY 
PURBECK IS FIFTY MILES FROM SALISBURY BY SEA AND RIVER 
THE PROPORTION OF PURBECK MARBLE TO CHILMARK STONE MAY BE TINY 
BUT THE CATHEDRAL IS VAST 
THERE IS ENOUGH PURBECK MARBLE TO BUILD A PARISH CHURCH 
WITH THE EXCEPTIONS OF THE TOWER AND THE SPIRE 
THE CATHEDRAL IS THE WORK OF A SINGLE CAMPAIGN OF CONSTRUCTION 
LASTING ROUGHLY HALF A CENTURY 
THIS IS WHAT DIFFERENTIATES IT FROM ALL OTHER MEDIEVAL EUROPEAN CATHEDRALS EXCEPT AMIENS 
THEY WERE ABLE TO BUILD IT IN ONE GO BECAUSE THE MONEY DIDN'T RUN OUT 
SALISBURY CATHEDRAL WAS ENTREPRENEURIAL FROM THE VERY START 
BECAUSE OF THE SINGLE CAMPAIGN 
THE CATHEDRAL IS STYLISTICALLY CONSISTENT 
IT POSSESSES A STARTLING PURITY 
THE PLAN IS SIMPLE RECTILINEAR 
AND SYMMETRICAL 
IT IS ONLY THE ADDITIONS OF THE CLOISTERS AND CHAPTERHOUSE 
WHICH PREVENT US SEEING THIS SYMMETRY 
THE CLASSIFICATION OF THIS SORT OF GOTHIC AS EARLY ENGLISH IS TELLING 
THERE IS A DOSE OF SELF CONSCIOUS NATIONALISM HERE 
THIS IS THE FIRST GREAT BUILDING FOUNDED IN THE ENGLISH PATHOLOGY CALLED COMMON SENSE 
WHICH REJECTS SUCH COUNTER INTUITIVE WHEEZES AS FLYING BUTTRESSES 
IN FAVOUR OF THICK FORTRESS LIKE LOAD BEARING WALLS 
THE BUILDERS DIDN'T KNOW THAT WHAT THEY WERE MAKING WAS GOTHIC 
THE WORD WASN'T USED OF BUILDINGS TILL THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
WHAT DOES GOTHIC MEAN POINTED ARCHES 
A SENSIBILITY NO THAT CAME LATER 
WAS THE CATHEDRAL'S STYLE STRUCTURALLY DETERMINED 
WAS IT THE SPATIAL EXPRESSION OF SPIRITUAL NECESSITY 
WAS IT A GLIMPSE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH HENCE ITS DIVESTMENT OF WEIGHT AND THE ILLUSION THAT IT SOARS 
WAS IT AN IMITATION OF A FOREST NAVE 
DOES ITS FORM FOLLOW ITS LITURGICAL FUNCTIONS 
IS IT A PHYSICAL EXPRESSION OF THE CHURCH'S RITUALISTIC NEEDS 
AS USUAL IT WAS PROBABLY A COMBINATION OF ALL THESE FACTORS 
AMEN 
THE HISTORY OF THE CATHEDRAL IS THE HISTORY OF DIFFERENT AGES' TASTES 
OF DIFFERENT AGES' ATTITUDES TO THE GOTHIC AND THE PAST 
IN THE MID SEVENTEENTH CENTURY MOLIERE 
WHO LIKE SID JAMES AND TOMMY COOPER DIED ON STAGE 
WROTE GOTHIC ORNAMENTS ARE HATEFUL MONSTERS FROM AN IGNORANT AGE 
WHOSE BARBARISM PRODUCED THEM IN TORRENTS JUST LIKE THAT 
UP TILL THEN THE GOTHIC REVIVAL 
THAT'S GOTHICK WITH A TERMINAL K. 
HAD BEEN ROMANTIC STAGEY PLAYFUL 
ITS GREATEST ARTEFACT WAS FONTHILL ABBEY WEST OF SALISBURY 
ARCHITECT JAMES WYATT WHO HAD JUST SUPERVISED THE DEMOLITION 
OF THE CATHEDRAL'S FREE STANDING BELL TOWER 
AND OF TWO CHAPELS WHICH HAD BEEN ADDED TO THE MAIN STRUCTURE 
WYATT EARNED THE SOBRIQUET THE DESTROYER 
BUT BY THE AESTHETIC NORMS OF THE DAY HIS WERE UNEXCEPTIONABLE ACTIONS 
THEY WERE IN ACCORD WITH CURRENT PICTURESQUE THOUGHT 
WHICH VALUED SUBLIMITY DRAMA AND AWE OVER QUAINTNESS AND PRETTINESS 
AND RECKONED NEW GOTHIC WAS SUPERIOR TO THE MEDIEVAL GEAR 
WELL 
I THINK WYATT WAS A BIT OF A NAUGHTY BOY 
HE DID TAKE A LOT OF ORIGINAL STAINED GLASS OUT 
AND DEMOLISHED A COUPLE OF CHANTRY CHAPELS THE BELL TOWER AND PAINTED OUT THE CEILING 
SO I THINK HE'S DONE QUITE A LOT OF DAMAGE 
BUT AT THE TIME THE CATHEDRALS WERE ALL CHANGING AND THAT WAS THE IDEA 
WELL IT'S SO SWEET AND EASY TO LOVE YOU 
THE CONCEIT OF WYATT AND THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PICTURESQUE MOVEMENT 
WAS TO CREATE BUILDINGS AND LANDSCAPES THAT RESEMBLED PICTURES 
THE PICTURESQUE ALSO TAUGHT US TO LOOK AT EXTANT LANDSCAPE 
AS THOUGH IT WAS A PICTURE 
IT INVITED US TO CONSIDER ARCHITECTURE 
AS A FORM OF MAN MADE SCENERY 
IT APPROPRIATED BUILDINGS 
IT TREATED THEM AS VISUAL PHENOMENA AS OUTSIZE SCULPTURES 
IT WAS INDIFFERENT TO THEIR FUNCTION 
IT GAVE THEM A NEW PURPOSE AS EYE CATCHERS 
THIS IS HOW JOHN CONSTABLE TREATED THE CATHEDRAL AND HOW WE SHOULD 
NOT AS A MONUMENT TO DELUSION AND COLLECTIVE INFIRMITY 
BUT AS AN ENCHANTMENT WHOSE TANGIBLE PHYSICALITY 
VANQUISHES ITS SUPPOSED SPIRITUALITY 
THERE'S BEEN A CHOIR IN EXISTENCE AT THE CATHEDRAL 
PROBABLY FOR ABOUT ONE THOUSAND YEARS WHEN THE CATHEDRAL WAS AT OLD SARUM 
AND THE MUSIC IS A GREAT PART OF THE LITURGY 
I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT MUSIC CAN OFTEN EXPRESS SENTIMENTS THAT MERE WORDS CAN'T 
FOR MANY HUNDRED YEARS THE STATUTES SAID SIXTEEN BOY CHORISTERS AND SIX MEN 
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHEN MY PREDECESSOR AND THE THEN DEAN DECIDED THAT AFTER ONE THOUSAND YEARS 
IT WAS TIME THE GIRLS GOT THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AS THE BOYS 
AND ONE 
SADLY TODAY IN OUR SECULAR SOCIETY 
THE OLD SCHOOL ASSEMBLY WITH A CHRISTIAN HYMN IN THE MORNING HAS GONE 
IT MEANS THAT THIS GREAT TRADITION OF HYMNODY WHICH HAS GONE ON FOR CENTURIES IS GETTING LOST 
AND SO I SUPPOSE IN OUR GREAT CATHEDRALS WE ARE ONE OF THE LAST STANDARD BEARERS 
OF THIS GREAT SKILL THAT'S WHY WE DO IT 
THE REST OF MY LIFE 
MAY BE COMPLETED IN THEE 
IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL BUILDING AESTHETICALLY ARCHITECTURALLY BUT IT'S LOVELY TO SING IN AS WELL 
BUT OF COURSE HAVING SO MUCH STONE AROUND DOES HELP ENORMOUSLY 
THEY WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT IN THESE VAST SPACES 
AND IN THE VERY EARLY DAYS THE NEED FOR UNACCOMPANIED SINGING WHICH OF COURSE IT'S PERFECT FOR THAT 
IT'S A COMFORTING BUILDING A LOVELY BUILDING TO WORK IN AND A TOTALLY INSPIRING BUILDING 
AND EVERY TIME I COME OUT OF MY FRONT DOOR I THINK I STOP FOR A SECOND AND GASP 
WHILST TRYING TO RETAIN A CERTAIN SENSE OF REALITY 
IF THE CATHEDRAL IMPRESSES US TODAY 
IMAGINE THE REACTION IT MUST HAVE PROMPTED IN PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN ACCOMMODATION 
THAT WAS BARELY TALLER THAN THEY WERE WHO SHARED THEIR ROOMS WITH FAMILY AND ANIMALS 
WHOSE DWELLINGS PROVIDED ONLY THE MOST RUDIMENTARY SHELTER 
IMAGINE THEIR WONDER AT THE SHEER SCALE OF THE STRUCTURE 
IMAGINE THEIR WONDER AT THE MONEY THAT WAS REQUIRED TO CONSTRUCT THE LARGEST BUILDING THEY'D EVER SEE 
WHERE DID IT COME FROM 
ENGLAND IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY WAS NOT A SECULAR STATE 
RELIGIOUS BELIEF WAS NOT AN OPTIONAL EXTRA 
IT INFECTED OUR FOREBEARS AS IT INFECTS DUMB CREATIONISTS TODAY 
THE CHURCH WAS THE EXCLUSIVE SOURCE OF LEARNING 
THE CLERICY WAS LITERATE MOST OF THE POPULACE WAS ILLITERATE 
THE CHURCH OPPRESSED WITH ITS WEIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE IT WAS A TOTALITARIAN MONOPOLY 
IT WAS THUS ABLE TO EXACT TITHES AND TAXES FROM THE POOR 
THIS TITHE BARN WHICH BELONGED TO THE NUNNERY OF SHAFTSBURY IS ALMOST SIXTY M. LONG 
THE BRIDES OF CHRIST COULD STORE VAST QUANTITIES OF THEIR BOUNTY IN IT 
FOR THE WEALTHY THE CHURCH HAD LONG DEVISED VARIOUS MEANS OF EXTORTION WHICH ALLOWED GREAT ART TO BE MADE 
RELICS WERE OFFICIALLY SANCTIONED TAT 
IF EVERY SHARD OF THE ONE TRUE CROSS ON WHICH CHRIST DIED 
AT THE ABATTOIR OF CALVARY WAS GLUED TOGETHER 
THE TOTAL OF THOSE NON CARBON DATE TESTED PIECES OF GNARLED WOOD 
WOULD FAR EXCEED THE GREATEST CROSS THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN 
IT WOULD DWARF THIS CATHEDRAL 
IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THE CATHEDRAL RAISES MONEY THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS 
MAGNA CARTA FRIDGE MAGNET 
YOURS FOR ONE POINT NINE NINE 
GARGOYLE FRIDGE MAGNET 
NATIVITIES MADE IN THE HOLY LAND 
THE ONE THING ALL THE MAJOR WORLD RELIGIONS HAVE IN COMMON IS THE ENDLESS APPETITE FOR KITSCH 
THE CHURCH ALSO DEPENDED ON GIFTS 
THERE WAS OF COURSE A QUID PRO QUO 
INDULGENCES WERE A SCAM THAT DEMONSTRATE THE CHURCH'S COMMERCIAL ACUMEN 
AND COMPROMISE GREED 
IT SOLD ITS FORGIVENESS IT EASED THE ROUTE TO A BETTER AFTERLIFE FOR THOSE WHO COULD AFFORD IT 
AND WHO COULD THEN EXHIBIT THEIR PIETY IN MONUMENTS' 
THE CHURCH PEDDLED AND STILL PEDDLES PERNICIOUS SUPERSTITIONS 
BUT THEY'RE THE PERNICIOUS SUPERSTITIONS WHICH MADE WESTERN CIVILISATION 
THE CHURCH'S PRODUCT WAS UNIQUE THE PROMISE OF HEAVEN WAS DESPERATELY COVETED 
THE SUPERSTITIOUS WILL DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO APPEASE GOD AND GOD'S GATEKEEPERS 
THE FEAR OF HELL WAS REAL 
THE CHURCH LEFT YOU IN NO DOUBT OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF NON ADHERENCE TO ITS DOGMA 
TODAY WE ARE OBLIGED TO DISOCCIATE BUILDING FROM ARCHAIC PURPOSE 
WE HAVE TO DIVEST THE ARCHITECTURE OF ITS ORIGINAL MEANING 
WE HAVE TO REALISE AS WE DO WHEN FACED BY TEMPLES BUILT BY SLAVES 
THAT BEAUTY CAN BE BORN OF ETHICAL SQUALOR OPPRESSION AND CORRUPTION 
WE HAVE TO REALISE THAT GREAT ART IS MADE IN THE BASEST CAUSES 
TO SATISFY THE WHIMS OF MURDEROUS POPES INSANE KINGS AND GENOCIDAL TYRANTS 
NO DOUBT THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH GOD AND HIS MYSTERIOUS WAYS 
THIS BUILDING IS ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF GOD IN THE WORLD NOW 
AND THEREFORE NOBODY SHOULD COME HERE UNLESS THEY'RE PREPARED 
TO ENCOUNTER GOD AS WELL AS THE HISTORY AND ARCHITECTURE 
SO SHOULD ONE BE ASHAMED TO SEPARATE THE AESTHETIC FROM THE MORAL 
THIS IS THE MOST AUSTERE OF CATHEDRAL INTERIORS 
MAGNIFICENT CERTAINLY MAGNIFICENTLY PURE 
BUT EQUALLY IT IS JOYLESS THIN LIPPED TOO HOLY BY HALF 
IT WAS OF COURSE BUILT AS A CATHOLIC CHURCH 
BUT IT SEEMS TO PREDICT PROTESTANTISM EVEN PURITANISM 
IF IT IS THE HOUSE OF GOD IT IS THE HOUSE OF A TERRIFYING GOD 
WHO OPPRESSES WITH THE HEIGHT AND MIGHT OF HIS DOMAIN 
IT'S SURELY A MIRACLE THAT IT'S STILL STANDING 
IT SHOULDN'T BE ITS SURVIVAL DEFIES TECTONIC REASON 
THE FOUNDATIONS ARE A MERE FOUR F. T. DEEP 
BUT HAD THEY BEEN ANY DEEPER THEY'D HAVE STRUCK THE WATER TABLE 
YET THE ONLY READILY VISIBLE SIGN OF THIS DEFICIENCY IS THIS 
THE SLEEPER WALL WHICH SPREADS THE LOAD OF THE COLUMN 
HUMANKIND CAN'T TAKE TOO MUCH PURITY 
THE CATHEDRAL'S UNITY IS MERCIFULLY RELIEVED 
BY ADDITIONS MADE DOWN THE CENTURIES 
MOST OF THEM STYLISTICALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE STRUCTURE AND MADE IN THE FASHION OF THEIR DAY 
THE RICHER AND MORE POWERFUL THE DEAD THE RICHER AND MORE OSTENTATIOUS THEIR MONUMENT 
CHANTRY CHAPELS ARE POSTHUMOUS INDULGENCES MADE FISCAL 
THEY'RE PIOUSLY AND GREEDILY DEVOTED TO PRAYERS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL SOUL 
AUDLEY IS BURIED HERE IN HIS DAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY COLOURFUL 
THE NICHES WOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF STATUES 
THE COLOUR ABOVE US THAT WAS TAKEN OFF AT THE REFORMATION 
THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF THE CHANTRY CHAPEL 
WAS DESTROYED AT THE REFORMATION WHEN PURGATORY ITSELF WAS ABOLISHED 
SO OUR LITTLE CHANTRY CHAPEL IS NOW WITHOUT ITS ORIGINAL PURPOSE 
SIR THOMAS GORGES BUILT LONGFORD CASTLE JUST OUTSIDE SALISBURY IN THE LAST DECADE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
LIKE HIS GREAT HOUSE WHOSE TRIANGULAR PLAN ALLUDES TO THE TRINITY 
HIS MONUMENT IS ODD 
AND IT IS THOUGHT TO PORTRAY HIS INTEREST IN THE OCCULT AND ASTROLOGY 
THESE FASHIONABLE PURSUITS WERE NOT SANCTIONED BY THE REFORMED CHURCH 
BUT SIR THOMAS WAS A RICH MAN SO WAS GRANTED IN DEATH A DISPENSATION 
NOW OF COURSE THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT ATTRACTIONS FOR ME COMING TO THIS CATHEDRAL WEEK BY WEEK BY WEEK 
EVERY TIME YOU COME IN YOU SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND YOU GET THIS TREMENDOUS SENSE 
OF THIS GLORIOUS BUILDING WHICH HAS BEEN HERE FOR EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS 
VIRTUALLY THE SAME AS IT WAS 
AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST BUILDINGS IN THE WORLD 
THERE'S ALWAYS A FEELING THAT THERE IS A PRESENCE 
NOT IN A SINISTER OR GHOSTLY SENSE 
BUT THERE'S A FEEL TO THIS CATHEDRAL 
WHICH TENDS TO EMBRACE YOU WHEN YOU COME TO IT 
ALTHOUGH THE CLOISTERS WERE BEGUN SOON AFTER THE BODY OF THE CATHEDRAL WAS FINISHED 
THEY FEEL AS THOUGH THEY BELONG NOT ONLY TO A DIFFERENT AGE 
BUT TO A DIFFERENT MORE DECORATIVE SENSIBLITY 
THIS MAY HAVE BEEN BY DESIGN 
SALISBURY WAS NOT A MONASTIC CATHEDRAL THE CLOISTERS SERVED NO SACRED PURPOSE 
WHICH IS OF COURSE WHY THEY'RE SO ATTRACTIVE 
THEY WERE RATHER FOR CONTEMPLATION 
AND FOR THE CLERICS' WORLDLY RECREATIONS IN THEIR VARIOUS FORMS 
MANY'S THE NUN WHO WAS TUPPED ON THESE STONES 
THE CLOISTERS LINK THE CATHEDRAL TO THE CHAPTERHOUSE 
WHICH AGAIN POSSESSES A SUMPTUOUSNESS AND SWEETNESS 
NOT FOUND IN THE CATHEDRAL ITSELF 
DOUBTLESS THIS IS BECAUSE IT WAS FOR THE USE OF THE HIGHER CLERGY 
WHO WERE DESERVING OF A LUXURY DENIED TO THEIR FLOCK 
THE SPIRE WAS ADDED 
HALF A CENTURY AFTER THE REST OF THE CATHEDRAL WAS COMPLETED 
IT IS FOUR OH THREE F. T. NINE I. N. HIGH 
A FIGURE WHICH HAS FASCINATED EVERYONE WHO'S EVER HEARD IT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAE WEST 
THE ACTRESS SAID TO THE BISHOP THAT HE COULD KEEP HIS FOUR OH THREE F. T. 
NOW THERE ARE THREE STEPS TO HEAVEN 
WA WA OOH 
JUST LISTEN AND YOU WILL PLAINLY SEE 
HERE WE ARE AT THE BASE OF THE CATHEDRAL SPIRE AND LOOK AT THIS TIMBER HERE 
ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF THIS IS THE ORIGINAL TIMBER WHICH WAS PUT UP 
AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE SPIRE WAS BUILT 
IT WASN'T PUT UP HERE IN ORDER TO HOLD THE SPIRE UP 
IT WAS PUT UP AS THE SCAFFOLDING FROM WHICH THE SPIRE WAS BUILT 
AND OVER HERE WE HAVE GOT THE WINDLASS 
THE ORIGINAL MEDIEVAL CRANE 
WITH WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO BRING THE STONE UP TO THIS HEIGHT 
LOOK AT THIS WONDERFUL WHEEL HERE 
HERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S ENTIRELY FUNCTIONAL AND YET LOOK AT THE QUALITY OF THESE PIECES HERE 
OUTSIDE YOU'VE GOT THESE HANDHOLDS 
TWO GUYS WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE PULLING ROUND THIS SIDE 
AND TWO GUYS ON THE OTHER SIDE 
NOT AS SOME OF THE STONEMASONS USED TO DO 
RUN ROUND INSIDE HAVING LITTLE RACES 
YOU FIND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T MAKE IT TO THIS HEIGHT 
THEY GET OVERCOME BY THE SENSE OF HEIGHT 
BUT IF YOU DO GET HERE YOU GET A LITTLE BADGE WHICH SAYS YOU HAVE MADE THE HEIGHTS OF SALISBURY CATHEDRAL 
WHEN THE CATHEDRAL WAS A BUILDING FOR THE CREDULOUS RATHER THAN FOR TOURISTS 
THE CONGREGATION WOULD HAVE BEEN DENIED ACCESS 
TO THE INTERIOR OF THE TOWER AND THE SPIRE 
SALISBURY IS AT ONCE QUINTESSENTIALLY ENGLISH 
AND ENTIRELY ATYPICAL 
ITS FORM IS AT ODDS WITH ITS SIZE 
IT'S LIKE A PARISH CHURCH INFLATED TO BURSTING POINT 
REMEMBER THE MORRIS OXFORD WHICH WAS A PUMPED UP MORRIS MINOR 
THE STYLES MAKE NO CONCESSION TO THE VOLUME OF THEIR DEPLOYMENT 
IT'S A DISTENDED MODEL 
WHICH SUCCEEDS THROUGH ITS MAXIMALIST SCALE 
THE CATHEDRAL IS EVIDENTLY THE STAR TURN 
BUT IT'S PART OF AN ENSEMBLE 
ITS CLOSE IS THE LARGEST IN ENGLAND 
AND IT IS LITERALLY A CLOSE 
A WALLED ENCLOSED SPACE WITHIN A CITY 
IT IS IF YOU LIKE A GATED SUBURB 
THE WHITSUN FAIRS USED TO BE HELD IN THE WONDERFUL CLOSE BELOW US 
AND PEOPLE APPARENTLY GOT LIQUORED UP AND DECIDED TO CLIMB THE SPIRE 
CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTS SUGGEST THERE WERE EIGHT OR TEN GOING UP THE OUTSIDE OF THIS BUILDING 
AND ONE OF THEIR JOYOUS PRACTICES WAS TO DISCHARGE URINE UPON THE FOLK BELOW 
THEY TALK ABOUT YOB CULTURE NOWADAYS 
THERE ARE FOUR GATES WHICH ARE LOCKED AT NIGHT 
THE WALLS ARE PARTLY COMPOSED OF STONES 
PLUNDERED FROM THE FORMER CATHEDRAL AT OLD SARUM 
IT IS ALSO A PEERLESS ANTHOLOGY OF DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE 
THIS IS CALLED WREN HALL IT'S NOT BY CHRISTOPHER WREN 
THERE'S NO PROOF THAT THE COLLEGE OF MATRONS IS BY WREN EITHER 
EVEN THOUGH IT RESEMBLES MORDEN COLLEGE ON BLACKHEATH 
WHICH IS ALSO ALLEGED TO BE BY HIM 
WHAT WE CAN BE SURE OF IS THAT WREN ADVISED HIS CLOSE FRIEND BISHOP SETH WARD 
ON HOW TO STRENGTHEN THE SPIRE 
A SECOND THING WE CAN BE SURE OF IS THAT THIS BEING GENTEEL PROVINCIAL ENGLAND 
FALSE ATTRIBUTIONS TO WREN ARE ONLY TO BE EXPECTED 
THE KING'S HOUSE MUSEUM HOLDS PART OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL COLLECTION 
MADE BY GENERAL AUGUSTUS PITT RIVERS A MAN SO ANTI CLERICAL 
THAT HE BUILT AN ECCENTRIC PARK THE LARMER TREE GARDENS ON HIS ESTATE 
AND USED TO SEND CARRIAGES ON SUNDAYS TO TRANSPORT THE POPULACE 
IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM OUT OF CHURCH 
THE NORTH CANONRY IS AMONG THE OLDEST BUILDINGS IN THE CLOSE 
YET WHAT WE SEE TODAY IS NOT MEDIEVAL IT'S NOT TUDOR 
IT'S NOT OF THE RESTORATION IT IS PREDOMINANTLY VICTORIAN 
IT STARES OUT AT THE CATHEDRAL'S PREDOMINANTLY VICTORIAN WEST FRONT 
IT'S THE WORK OF THE SAME ARCHITECT 
GEORGE GILBERT SCOTT 
AS IT'S A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE 
THE CATHEDRAL AUTHORITIES ARE LOATH TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS ANYTHING OTHER THAN MEDIEVAL 
OLD IS GOOD BOX OFFICE 
VICTORIAN ISN'T 
ON THE WEST FRONT YOU'LL FIND THAT WHEN THE VICTORIANS HAD THEIR RESTORATION 
THEY CHANGED THE ICONOLOGY OF THE WEST FRONT 
AND THE STYLE OF THE STATUES WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
MEDIEVAL PEOPLE CARVED FROM LIFE 
FROM THE FACE OF SOMEBODY THAT WAS THERE 
WHEREAS THE VICTORIANS LOVED TO GLAMORISE THEIR SAINTS AND MARTYRS 
AND MAKE ALL THE WOMEN ELFIN FACED 
AND ALL THE MEN MACHO MEN 
THE STYLE HAS CHANGED AND NOW WHEN A NEW STATUE IS CARVED 
IT'S CARVED MORE OR LESS IN THE STYLE OF THE MEDIEVAL WORKS 
SCOTT'S RESTORATION OF THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTIES 
LEFT SALISBURY WITH A CHOIR THAT IS MORE MEDIEVAL THAN THE REAL THING 
IT'S ENGAGINGLY REMINISCENT OF SAINT PANCRAS STATION 
IF YOU FLEW OVER THE TOP OF THE CATHEDRAL 
AND LOOKED DOWN ON ITS CRUCIFORM SHAPE 
AND THEN YOU WENT THROUGH THE ROOF 
YOU'D ARRIVE AT THE CHOIR IN THE CENTRE OF THIS CRUCIFIX 
IN TERMS OF THE LITURGY OF THE PLACE THE CHOIR AREA 
IS WHERE ALL THE ACTION IS IT IS THE HEARTBEAT OF THE PLACE 
HEARTBEAT WHY DO YOU MISS 
WHEN MY BABY KISSES ME 
THE HOLY DUSTERS STARTED BECAUSE I WAS ON THE CATHEDRAL COUNCIL 
AT THE TIME OF SYDNEY EVANS AND I'D NOTICED THE CHOIR LOOKING VERY 
UNCARED FOR I SAID THIS TO THE DEAN AND HE SAID TO ME WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT 
SO THAT WAS ME HOIST WITH MY OWN PETARD 
ACTUALLY IT DOES LOOK A LOT DIFFERENT FROM HOW IT WAS 
IT REALLY GLOWS NOW 
WE'RE NOW TWENTY YEARS OLD ALTHOUGH A LOT OF US ARE MUCH OLDER THAN THAT 
AND WE HOPE WE SHALL GO ON FOR EVER REALLY 
I THINK EVERYBODY FEELS HAPPY WHEN THEY COME IN AND THEY ALL FEEL THAT THIS IS A DIFFERENT PLACE 
FROM AN ORDINARY HOME YOU KNOW IT HAS A SPIRITUAL FEELING 
AS SOON AS YOU WALK IN YOU CAN FEEL IT WHICH IS LOVELY 
SHE'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITES BECAUSE SHE PLAYS THE CLARINET AND MY DAUGHTER PLAYS THE CLARINET 
AND SHE'S CONCENTRATING ON WHAT SHE'S DOING WHICH A MUSICIAN OUGHT 
WE CAN'T GET AT THE TOP BITS OF COURSE 
WE ONCE HAD A CLEANER WHO WAS VERY ATHLETIC AND USED TO GET UP THERE AND FRIGHTEN US TO DEATH 
BUT WE CAN'T I CAN JUST REACH WITH MY TICKLE STICK UP UNDERNEATH 
BUT NO I THINK THEY'RE LOVELY 
WE OFTEN SAY WE DUST MORE IN HERE THAN WE DO IN OUR OWN HOUSES 
BUT IT'S GOOD WE LOVE IT 
IT'S BECAUSE IT'S OUR CATHEDRAL AND YOU DO GET QUITE POSSESSIVE ABOUT IT 
AND I LOVE THE THROUGH VISION RIGHT THROUGH WITHOUT THE CHOIR ARCH 
IT'S LOVELY YOU CAN STAND AT THE BACK AND SEE RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH 
SCOTT'S REREDOS WHICH DIVIDED THE CHOIR FROM THE NAVE 
WAS REMOVED IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES 
WHEN VICTORIAN TASTE WAS STILL COMMONLY ABHORRED 
BUT THE CATHEDRAL RETAINS MUCH FINE VICTORIAN WORK 
AND TO ME IT WILL ALWAYS FEEL VICTORIAN 
THE HOUSE OF A CENSORIOUS IRATE UNLOVING GOD 
WHO TAKES COLD SHOWERS AND NEVER SPARES THE ROD 
SCOTT I THINK WAS VERY SYMPATHETIC 
THERE'S EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN SYMPATHETIC TO REPLACEMENT 
AND HE'S LEFT A CLUE AS TO WHAT WAS THERE ORIGINALLY 
I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE SAID A LOT OF BAD THINGS ABOUT SCOTT BUT I THINK HE WAS SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS RESTORATION 
THE CATHEDRAL IS A WORK IN PERPETUAL PROGRESS 
IT'S A REPLICA OF SALISBURY CATHEDRAL 
AN ON SITE FORGERY OF THE ORIGINAL 
IT IS FOREVER MUTATING 
IT'S ETERNALLY BEING RENEWED 
EVERY DAY I STILL MARVEL AT IT EVERY TIME I COME HERE 
THE SHEER SIZE OF IT AND THE AMOUNT OF HOURS TO CREATE IT FANTASTIC 
EVEN IF WE WERE TO RECREATE A SMALL PART OF IT IT WOULD BE A MAJOR OPERATION 
COSTING MILLIONS OF POUNDS I EXPECT 
ALL THE STONE IS OLD ISN'T IT WHEN IT COMES FROM THE QUARRIES 
PROBABLY AS OLD AS THE STONE THAT'S HERE JUST BEEN WORKED MORE RECENTLY 
IT'S VERY FABRIC DEPENDS ON THIS STONEYARD 
AND THE SKILL OF THE SURVEYORS MASONS AND CARVERS HERE 
THEIR WORK IS DELICATELY BALANCED 
THERE ARE COUNTLESS DEGREES OF PRESERVATION PROTECTION RESTORATION 
WHAT INTERVENTION SHOULD BE MADE 
EVERY STONE WHICH IS MARKED UP IN COLOUR 
IS BEING REPLACED SO AS YOU CAN SEE 
THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF STONES FOR REPLACEMENT 
BUT AS A WHOLE AREA IT'S VERY MINIMAL 
COMPARED WITH THE WHOLE VOLUME OF STONE IN THAT SECTION 
BUT THE ARCHITECTS ARE LOATH TO REPLACE ANY STONE 
WHICH CAN BE KEPT IF AT ALL POSSIBLE 
THAT'S WHY QUITE A FEW OF THE STONES ON THE PARAPET ARE JUST PIECED IN 
AND REPAIRED BY THE CONSERVATION DEPARTMENT 
IT'S SOMETHING WE DON'T ALWAYS LIKE TO DO OURSELVES WE LIKE TO SEE NEW STONE FITTED MORE OFTEN 
EVERYONE WANTS TO CONSERVE EVERYTHING GONE CONSERVATION MAD 
CERTAINLY IN THE MASONRY DEPARTMENT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE NEW WORK 
AND SOMETIMES WE FEEL OUR HANDS ARE TIED AND WE DON'T GET TO DO 
ENOUGH NEW CARVING AND NEW WORK AS WE'D LIKE 
BUT LEFT TO OUR OWN DEVICES WE'D PROBABLY REBUILD THE CATHEDRAL 
PERHAPS NOT THAT BAD BUT WE'D LIKE TO REPLACE MORE THAN WE DO 
AS YOU CAN SEE THESE BITS HERE ARE ALL NEW BITS 
THEY WERE BEYOND ANY KIND OF CONSERVATION OR RESTORATION 
SO THEY'VE ACTUALLY BEEN REPLACED 
AS WE COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER 
SOME OF THIS STONE IS STILL PRETTY SOLID THAT'S THE ORIGINAL STONE 
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS REPAIR THE STONE IN A LIME BASED MORTAR 
TO TRY AND IMITATE THE STONE AROUND IT 
SO THAT IT FITS IN 
THERE SEEMS CURRENTLY TO BE AN INTENTION TO SWEEP AWAY THE ACCRETION OF THE AGES 
IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THE STONE 
BUT THIS PROCESS OF REPLACEMENT AND PURGING OF DIRT AND LICHEN 
IS LIABLE TO RESULT IN A BRAND NEW MEDIEVAL CATHEDRAL 
SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL THAT JUST BECAUSE A STONE IS OLD IT'S SOMEHOW SACROSANCT 
BUT IT ISN'T ONCE IT'S OLD ONCE IT'S DEAD IT'S LESS THAN USELESS 
CHUCK IT AWAY AND PUT A NEW HEALTHY PIECE OF STONE IN 
ULTIMATELY IT'S DISEASED FLESH GET RID OF IT AND LET THE BUILDING LIVE 
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT THINK OF AN ANCIENT STARLET WITH A FACE LIFT 
THIS IS WHAT THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF ANCIENT BUILDINGS WAS FOUNDED TO PREVENT 
DECAY IN BUILDINGS IS AS INEVITABLE AS MORTALITY IN HUMANS 
IT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD 
BY TODAY'S STANDARDS OUR WORK'S MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE MEDIEVAL WORK BY FAR 
YOU'D SAY IT WAS RUBBISH REALLY IF THEY PUT UP THE STANDARD OF WORK LIKE THE MEDIEVAL DAY TODAY 
THE RUINOUS AND THE DERELICT 
ARE PREFERABLE TO THE REPAIRED AND THE PERFECT 
TURNER REALISED THIS BUT AGAIN DERELICTION IS NOT GOOD BOX OFFICE 
AND A CATHEDRAL IS NOTHING IF NOT A BUSINESS 
SURE IT'S ALSO A PLACE OF WORSHIP 
IT'S ALSO THE FOCAL POINT OF A COMMUNITY 
BUT THESE ARE NOW PERIPHERAL ROLES 
GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON WHERE ARE YOU FROM 
THIS WAS THE FIRST ENGLISH CATHEDRAL TO HAVE INVITED ITS VISITORS TO PAY ENTRY FEES 
THERE IS SOME KIND OF A DONATION WE HAVE TO MAKE 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUT WE SUGGEST I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE IN FINLAND BUT WE GET NO STATE AID HERE 
AND TO KEEP OUR BUILDINGS UP WE ASK PEOPLE TO PUT MONEY THROUGH A DONATIONS BOX ALL RIGHT 
THERE ARE BOXES INSIDE BUT IF YOU GIVE IT TO ME THEN I GIVE YOU A LITTLE DOCKET THAT SAYS THANK YOU 
AND THAT'S ONLY A SUGGESTION YOU DON'T HAVE TO OBEY IT ALL RIGHT INVITATIONS CAN BE TURNED DOWN 
BUT WHEN PEOPLE SAY WHAT DO YOU WANT I USUALLY SAY WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE ME 
SO LITERALLY WHATEVER YOU FEEL ABLE TO 
JUST WHAT YOU SUGGEST YES LET'S SAY KEEP THE CHANGE AND TAKE EIGHT 
O. K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY PACKED UP COS WE STOP TAKING DONATIONS AT QUARTER TO FIVE 
SO AFTER ALL THAT I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANY CHANGE COS IT'S ALL LOCKED UP IN THE SAFE 
AND THERE ARE DONATION BOXES INSIDE 
OVER THE CENTURIES THE ROLES OF THESE GREAT CATHEDRALS HAVE CHANGED 
TODAY WE'RE DEALING WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT DEMANDS AND EXPECTATIONS FROM PEOPLE 
ON ONE LEVEL OF COURSE THIS IS A MARVELLOUS TOURIST ATTRACTION 
PEOPLE COME HERE TO SEE THIS FANTASTIC BUILDING 
AND WE NOW HAVE THIS NEW RESTAURANT WHICH MEANS OUR MINISTRY OF HOSPITALITY CAN BE DEVELOPED FURTHER 
THAT'S A VERY SYMBOLIC THING IN THE EARLY DAYS WHAT DID JESUS DO HE ATE AND DRANK WITH HIS DISCIPLES 
THAT'S A VERY SYMBOLIC THING IN THE EARLY DAYS WHAT DID JESUS DO HE ATE AND DRANK WITH HIS DISCIPLES 
AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT CHRISTIAN ETHIC 
SALISBURY CATHEDRAL OPEN DAILY 
THE REFECTORY RESTAURANT AVAILABLE IN THE EVENINGS 
FOR A VARIETY OF EVENTS SUCH AS MEETINGS DINNERS AND PRESENTATIONS 
THE CHAPTERHOUSE LAWN A GREAT LOCATION FOR A MARQUEE TO ACCOMMODATE WEDDING RECEPTIONS 
AND LARGER FUNCTIONS 
THE CHAPTERHOUSE AVAILABLE IN THE EVENINGS FOR DRINKS RECEPTIONS 
INTIMATE CONCERTS AND SMALL DINNER PARTIES 
FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT US BY PHONE OR FAX 
OR E. MAIL SALISBURYCATHEDRAL AT COMPASS GROUP COUK 
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MERCHANTS IN THE TEMPLE 
SO WHY SHOULD THE TEMPLE NOT KICK OUT THE MIDDLE MAN AND BECOME A MERCHANT ITSELF 
THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND'S ROLE TODAY 
IS TO CARE FOR A PRICELESS COLLECTION OF MASTERPIECES AND THAT REQUIRES INCOME 
SO BUILD A ROLLER COASTER 
AND THESE COLUMNS MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE FOR POLE DANCING 
A VERY NEW DIMENSION OF CATHEDRALS' LIFE IS THE CASUAL VISITOR 
THE SHORT TERM VISITOR 
OVER THE GENERATIONS PEOPLE HAVE COME ON PILGRIMAGE HERE BUT THEY'D HAVE BEEN FEW IN NUMBER 
AND THEY MAY HAVE ONLY COME ONCE IN THEIR LIFE IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE GREAT PILGRIMAGE OF THEIR LIFE 
NOW WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EVERY DAY 
WE HAVE MASSIVE NUMBERS OF WORSHIPPERS AND TOURISTS 
WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM A FLAVOUR 
OF ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE STOOD US IN GOOD STEAD FOR SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS 
ALMIGHTY GOD WHO FORGIVES ALL WHO TRULY REPENT 
HAVE MERCY UPON YOU PARDON AND DELIVER YOU FROM ALL YOUR SINS 
AMEN 
CATHEDRALS ARE POPULAR IT SEEMS TO ME 
BECAUSE THEY ARTICULATE VERY WELL 
AND WITH SOMETIMES SUPERB MUSIC 
AND THE BEST OF CREATIVE PERFORMANCE 
THAT THEY ARTICULATE ACTUALLY WHAT THE HEART OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT IS SEARCHING FOR 
MERCIFUL FATHER ACCEPT THESE PRAYERS 
FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR SON OUR SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST 
AMEN 
THE BUILDING ITSELF IS SACRED 
IT'S A HOLY PLACE 
AND IF PEOPLE GO AWAY ONLY HAVING ENCOUNTERED THE REFECTORY 
THE RESTAURANT THE TOILETS AND THE SHOP 
AND HAVEN'T BEEN TOUCHED BY SOMETHING OF THE AWESOME PRESENCE OF GOD 
THEN WE HAVE FAILED 
WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS MARVELLOUS BUILDING WE'RE FORCED TO REFLECT THAT GOD DOES INDEED EXIST 
AS A RECURRING AND BANAL HUMAN INVENTION 
AND WHEN WE CELEBRATE HIM AND HIS MANY MANSIONS 
WHAT WE ARE IN FACT CELEBRATING IS THE HUMAN APPETITE FOR CREATION 
WE MAY HATE OURSELVES FOR THE BUILDINGS THAT WE LOVE BUT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE US WE DON'T CHOOSE THEM 
IT'S NOT ENOUGH 
TO LOVE ME ON THIS EARTH BELOW 
IT'S NOT ENOUGH 
TO TAKE ME EVERYWHERE YOU GO 
I WANT TO KNOW WE WANT TO KNOW 
WILL YOU LOVE ME IN HEAVEN 
HEAVEN OH 
HEAVEN YEAH 
HEAVEN YEAH 
NOW COME ON LET'S DO IT 
THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS ARE OUT OF RETIREMENT 
YOU'RE MAURICE RILEY YOU'RE SYD WOOLSEY 
YOU'RE THE INVISIBLES 
ARGH 
THERE ISN'T A CAR I CAN'T DRIVE OR AN ALARM I CAN'T SILENCE
