IN FOUR WEEKENDS' TIME THIS 
PREMIER LEAGUE SEASON WILL BE 
COMPLETED AND AL DESPERATE STRUGGLE 
IS UNDER WAY TO AVOID BEING 
RELEGATED OUT OF THE TOP FLIGHT OF 
ENGLISH FOOTBALL IT IS ALAN AND 
LEE WHO WILL PICK OUT THE KEY 
MOMENTS FROM THE LATEST GAMES 
PLAYED FIRST THE MATCH AT THE 
MADEJSKI STADIUM WHERE RELEGATION 
ALARM BELLS WERE RINGING FOR FIFTH 
BOTTOM READING THEY WERE ALMOST 
DEAFENING FOR SECOND BOTTOM FULHAM 
WHO WENT INTO THE GAME SIX POINTS 
FROM SAFETY READING ARE SIX POINTS ABOVE THE 
RELEGATION DANGER LINE FULHAM SIX 
POINTS BELOW IT A HOME WIN HERE 
WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY GUARANTEE 
PREMIER LEAGUE FOOTBALL HERE AGAIN 
NEXT SEASON AND DOOM FULHAM A 
CLEAN SHEET FOR READING'S MARCUS 
HAHNEMANN WILL SURELY CONDEMN HIS 
OLD CLUB TO THE DROP EVERY GREAT 
ESCAPE NEEDS A TUNNEL DAVID HEALY 
COULD BE THAT MAN FOR FULHAM HE 
SCORED SIX GOALS IN NINE GAMES 
AGAINST READING TWO CHANGES FOR 
BOTH SIDES THEY HAVE NOT SCORED IN ONE HUNDRED NINETY ONE MINUTES 
THAT READING NEED TO WIN BUT A 
MATCH THAT FULHAM HAVE TO WIN 
LET'S SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO HERE 
WITH THIS FREE KICK FROM A SIDE 
THAT HAD BEEN IN NINETEENTH PLACE 
THROUGHOUT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BIKEY AND INGIMARSSON THREW 
THEMSELVES AT THE BALL REAL 
OPPORTUNITY FOR FULHAM HE WAS 
ONSIDE AS THE FREE KICK CAME 
FORWARD ANDRE BIKEY DEFLECTED IT 
UP AND OVER FULHAM HAVE JUST THE 
TWO WINS IN THIRTEEN GAMES THE SIDE WAS 
ALREADY IN FREEFALL OH THAT COULD BE SUCH A PRECIOUS 
GOAL DO THEY HAVE A LIFELINE GOOD 
LOW PENETRATING CROSS INTO THE 
CORRIDOR OF UNCERTAINTY FOR 
GOALKEEPERS AND MCBRIDE SLIDING 
IN GIVES FULHAM SUCH AN IMPORTANT 
LEAD READING HAVE PICKED UP SEVEN POINTS 
FROM THE LAST POSSIBLE NINE HERE 
THEY ARE PUTTING FULHAM UNDER 
PRESSURE NOW ROSENIOR FORCES THE 
CORNER THEY WILL NEED 
INGIMARSSON'S HEIGHT NICKY SHOREY 
WITH THE CORNER FOR READING THAT 
WAS A VERY GOOD HEADER AWAY BY 
MCBRIDE BIKEY WAS THE MAN BEHIND HIM STEVE 
COPPELL HAS BEEN IN THIS SORT OF 
SITUATION BEFORE ALMOST SAFE 
CRYSTAL PALACE WENT INTO THE LAST 
WEEK OF ONE CAMPAIGN WELL CLEAR OF 
RIVALS OLDHAM WHO PUT PALACE DOWN 
HE KNOWS THEY NEED AT LEAST THREE 
MORE POINTS FULHAM ARE KEEPING THE PRESSURE ON 
THAT IS THE SECOND BALL OF REAL 
QUALITY INTO THAT AREA IN THE GAME 
THEY SCORED FROM THE FIRST LOOKS DANGEROUS TODAY BRIAN 
MCBRIDE THIS IS A DANGER FOR 
FULHAM IT IS READING'S BEST CHANCE 
SO FAR DECEPTIVE FLOWING BALL BY 
OSTER KELLER WAS IN NO MAN'S LAND HEALY HAS BEEN A DECISIVE FACTOR 
BRIAN MCBRIDE OH THAT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN MAGNIFICENT AND THAT COULD BE 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FULHAM 
STAYING UP OR GOING DOWN LOVELY 
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN HEALY AND 
MCBRIDE CALLED IT MAGNIFICENTLY 
THAT IS MAGNIFICENT SAVE I DID 
NOT REALISE HE GOT A HAND TO IT 
THAT WAS A SPLENDID PIECE OF 
GOALKEEPING THEY CAME HERE 
THINKING A WIN WOULD SEE THEM SAFE 
THEY LOOK TENSE NOW ROSENIOR WITH 
THE LONG THROW AGAINST HIS OLD SIDE FIVE BLUE SHIRTS IN THE MIDDLE 
FREE HEADER FROM THERE HE 
HIT THE TARGET L. DO NOT THINK 
DANNY MURPHY HAS WASTED A PASS 
TODAY FULHAM HAVE ANOTHER CORNER ANOTHER 
DANGEROUS BALL PLAYED IN HERE BY 
FULHAM MCBRIDE WAS LEANING BACK I DON'T 
THINK HE EXPECTED SUCH ORNATE 
SKILLS FROM BREDE HANGELAND TO BE 
HONEST DID HANGELAND STEP OVER THE 
BALL HE DID WELL PLAYED HE WILL 
BE DELIGHTED WITH THE QUALITY OF 
SOME OF THEIR FOOTBALL TODAY IT IS A CORNER OFF ANDRE BIKEY 
BULLARD WITH THE CORNER HANGELAND 
HOW UNLUCKY HAVE FULHAM BEEN NOW READING CAN BREAK AGAIN DWELLING ON THE BALL BEFORE GETTING THE PASS AWAY TO KITSON TOO FAR AHEAD OF LITTLE BREDE 
HANGELAND WITHIN A WHISKER OF HIS 
FIRST GOAL IN ENGLISH FOOTBALL HE 
HAS HAD A GOOD GAME HE HAS DONE IT 
AGAIN HAHNEMANN OFF THE BAR BUT 
IT WAS ANOTHER GOOD PIECE OF 
GOALKEEPING A FREE KICK IS GIVEN FULHAM'S WAY 
BIKEY TOUCHED THE BALL BUT THERE 
WAS CONTACT WITH A PLAYER 
BEFOREHAND ACCORDING TO THE 
REFEREE IT IS OFF THE BAR AGAIN WOULD YOU 
BELIEVE IT UP AND OVER WALL 
FOR THE THIRD TIME FULHAM HAVE HIT 
THE WOODWORK CRUEL CRUEL ROY 
HODGSON WHO HAS BEEN AROUND A LONG 
TIME WILL KNOW THAT GAMES LIKE 
THIS HAVE A HABIT OF COMING BACK 
AND KICKING YOU IN THE TEETH BRILLIANT RECOVERY WHAT A 
CHALLENGE THAT WAS BY BIKEY THE 
DEFENDER HAD INITIALLY MADE A 
MISTAKE BY GETTING THE WRONG SIDE 
OF THE AMERICAN STRIKER HE 
RECOVERED SO WELL GOOD BREAK BY FULHAM IT IS TWO TO ZERO 
AND FULHAM HAVE WON AL MAGNIFICENT 
AND SO IMPORTANT VICTORY THAT IS 
WHAT IT MEANS TO THE FANS AND TO 
THE PLAYERS IT WAS AS WELL WORKED 
AS ANY OF THE FULHAM MOVES TODAY 
AND THEY HAVE PLAYED SO WELL CRISP 
INCISIVE PASSING GOOD BALANCE 
ABOUT THE TEAM AND HE TOOK HIS 
CHANCE SO WELL NEVLAND'S FIRST 
GOAL IN A FULHAM SHIRT AND HOW 
IMPORTANT THAT GOAL COULD PROVE FOR 
FULHAM IT HAS COME VERY LATE IN 
THE SEASON WITH GAMES RUNNING OUT 
AT LONG LAST THE FULHAM FANS CAN 
CELEBRATE AN AWAY VICTORY 
IT WAS A LONG TIME COMING BUT IT 
MAKES IT EVEN SWEETER THE 
PERFORMANCE MAKES IT SWEET AS WELL 
IT WAS A GOOD VICTORY IN THE SENSE 
THAT WE PLAYED WELL ENOUGH TO 
DESERVE IT 
YOU CANNOT COMPLAIN 
THAT THEY DID NOT DESERVE IT THEY 
THOROUGHLY DESERVED THE WIN TODAY 
I AM A BIT AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN WHY 
WE PLAYED POORLY 
MAYBE WE TOOK THE 
GAME A BIT TOO LIGHTLY THAT MIGHT 
BE THE CASE WITH FULHAM'S AWAY 
RECORD IN THE PAST THEY HAVE NOT 
WON IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS MAYBE WE WERE 
YOU KNOW I THOUGHT IT WOULD JUST 
HAPPEN WHEN YOU DO THAT AGAINST 
ANY TEAM YOU WILL LOSE 
IS THIS 
TOO LITTLE TOO LATE 
I HOPE NOT 
WE ARE GOING INTO EVERY GAME NOW 
WE HAVE TO GO INTO EVERY GAME 
FOCUSED ON DOING OUR JOB LIKE WE 
DID TODAY COME OUT WITH ENERGY AND 
DETERMINATION AND BELIEF 
AND IT 
IS STILL IN OUR OWN HANDS WE HAVE 
TO GET POINTS FROM OUR GAMES WE DO 
NOT HAVE TO LOOK AT OTHER RESULTS 
AND WORRY ABOUT HOW OTHER TEAMS ARE 
DOING WE JUST HAVE TO GET RESULTS 
WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT FULHAM 
TODAY 
THEY SEEM TO PLAY MORE TODAY RELAXED BECAUSE THEY HAD TO WIN 
THEY WERE NOT SITTING BACK THEY 
HAD A GOAL AT READING AND THE FULLY 
DESERVED TO WIN ALEX FERGUSON SAID 
DURING THE WEEK AT THIS STAGE OF 
THE SEASON YOU NEED TO PICK PLAYERS 
THEY HAVE TO BE PLAYERS THEY COULD 
BE KEY THIS GUY HAS GREAT 
QUALITIES WE KNOW WHAT HE CAN DO 
FROM FREE KICKS TODAY HE WAS A BIT 
UNLUCKY ANOTHER FREE KICK TO MAKE 
BREAD HE WAS A REAL HANDFUL 
MCBRIDE HIS JOB IS TO STAY AHEAD 
OF THE CENTRE HALF HE DOES COME 
ANY FIGHT HIM OFF IN THE END IT IS 
A GOOD BLOCK AS THE BALL COMES IN 
WHAT A VOLLEY AND WHAT A SAFE 
SAVE HERE IS DETERMINED TO GET IN 
THE BOX THAT IS A CENTRE FOR WHAT 
HE WANTS TO SCORE GOALS THAN TO WIN 
THEY HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES A 
LIFELINE AND HE IS GOING TO BE KEY 
HE CAN BE THE STANDARD BEARER I I WATCHED HIM PLAY AGAINST NEWCASTLE 
A FEW WEEKS AGO AND TWO HE COULD 
HAVE PLAYED ALL DAY AND HAVE NEVER 
SCORED COME IT TO DE ROY HODGSON 
WAS MORE ADVENTUROUS AND THE 
MIDDLE OF THE PARK YOU HAVE MURPHY 
IT HAS PAID OFF FOR THEM WILL STOP 
ANYTHING THAT CONCERNS YOU ABOUT 
READING'S PERFORMANCE MAYBE A BIT 
OF COMPLACENCY 
THE GREAT THING 
ABOUT READING IS THEY DO NOT DRAW 
MANY MATCHES 
FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THEY HAVE BEEN THE KING OF THE 
THEIR SHOULDER AGAIN IT IS NOT A 
GOOD TIME TO BE DOING THAT BOLTON BOLTON WERE THIRD BOTTOM ALSO IN 
DESPERATE NEED OF A WIN THEY WENT 
INTO A HOME GAME WITH WEST HAM 
THEY MANAGED TO LOSE A GAME THAT 
WAS IN THEIR GRASP AGAINST ARSENAL 
IT WAS FOLLOWED BY OUR HEAVY DEFEAT 
AT ASTON VILLA OPPONENTS WEST HAM 
ARE NOT THAT HAPPY WITH THIS SEASON 
FAIR OR OTHERWISE TENTH IN THE 
TABLE IS AN UNDER ACHIEVEMENT TWELVE TWELVE MONTHS AGO BOLTON WERE FIFTH IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE NOW FOUR POINTS 
ADRIFT AND A RELEGATION PLACE THEY 
WILL WIN THEIR HEARTS ON THEIR 
SLEEVES AGAINST WEST HAM BOLTON 
ARE RELIEVED TO HAVE A KEVIN NOLAN 
BACK AFTER INJURY AND SUSPENSION 
WEST HAM SAY THEY WILL PLAY WITH 
THREE STRIKERS DEAN ASTON AT 
LEADING THE LINE DEAN ASHTON HE HAS GOT A CORNER THERE IS AN 
HOUR THERE WAS A PROBLEM THERE 
FERDINAND'S HAND WENT STRAIGHT TO 
THE BACK OF HIS FIVE MAYBE NOT 
HAVING PROPERLY WARMED UP HE MIGHT 
HAVE PULLED A MUSCLE THE LEFT 
HANDER FERDINAND HAD ALREADY GONE 
DOWN AT THE BACK OF HIS LEFT SIDE 
WHAT AN EARLY PROBLEM IT IS CLEAR OFF THE GOAL LINE FOR 
WEST HAM BOLTON WERE THE GREAT 
EARLY CHANCE HERE TO BELIEVE THAT 
THE NERVES RELIEF THEY DESPERATELY NEED THE POINTS THIS AFTERNOON IT IS CLEAR OFF THE LINE AGAIN KEVIN DAVIES WITH THE HEADER YOU SENSE THAT BOLTON ARE GETTING 
CLOSE TO A BREAKTHROUGH 
O'BRIEN PUSHED FORWARD FOR THE SET 
PIECE IT 
IS THE FIRST YELLOW CARD HE HAD A 
SWING WHICH HE WOULD SAY WAS THAT 
THE BALL FALLS AT THE BALL IT IS THEN BUT IT IS OFFSIDE HE 
WAS GOING TO CELEBRATE HIS FIFTEENTH 
GOAL FOR BOLTON BUT HE SEES THE 
LINESMAN THE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND INTERNATIONAL 
WHO HAS SCORED FOURTEEN GOALS FOR BOLTON 
THE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND INTERNATIONAL GARY MEGSON SHAKING HIS HEAD GARY MEGSON WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
COULD WELL DECIDE BOLTON STAY 
BOLTON'S FATE IF BOLTON TEN KEEP UP 
THE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE THEY HAD IN 
THE FIRST HALF THEY MUST SURELY 
GET A BREAKTHROUGH KEVIN DAVIES 
SHOWING HIS WORTH IT IS IN IT IT IS KEVIN DAVIES 
LISTEN TO RAW NERVE THE ROAR 
OF THE CROWD KEVIN DAVIES SIDE 
FOOTS IT INTO THE NET IT IS HIS 
ONE HUNDRED CLUB KOREA GAULLE AND HIS FOURTH 
OF THE SEASON 
FOR BOLTON HE LOOKS LIKE A DISLOCATED FINGER FOR KEVIN DAVIES HE TURNS AWAY AS 
THE PHYSIOS STRAIGHTENS IT FOR HIM 
THERE IS BARELY A FLINCH HE IS 
CERTAIN TO COME BACK THAT MIGHT BE 
WHERE HE PICKED UP THE DISLOCATED 
FINGER KEVIN DAVIES BACK ON 
HAVING HAD SURGERY IN THE DRESSING 
ROOM BLOCKED ON THE GOAL LINE WHAT AN 
EFFORT AN EFFORT FROM DEAN ASHTON OFF THEIR HEAD OF SPECTRE FOR A CORNER KEVIN DAVIES TAKES UP HIS POSITION 
AS BOLTON PREPARE FOR THEIR TWELFTH 
CORNER OF THE MATCH HE HAD ANOTHER 
CHANCE HE TURNS AWAY IN 
DISAPPOINTMENT HE HAD COME OFF THE 
DEFENDER THAT'S A FOWL BOWEL FILE IT IS HIM BY NOLAN IT WILL NOT 
COUNT HE LOOKS ACROSS TO SEE THE 
FLAG RAISED THE FLAG WENT UP VERY 
QUICKLY KEVIN NOWLAN CLEARLY WAS 
AT LEAST HALF A YARD BEYOND THE 
LAST DEFENDER HE HAS WON THAT BUT HE HAS 
COMMITTED A FILE THAT IS YELLOW 
CARD FOR KEVIN DAVIES THAT MEANS 
THAT HE WILL NOW BE SUSPENDED IT IS FUMBLED AWAY AT THE FOOT OF THE POST 
NOBODY IT EXEMPLIFIED THE EFFORT 
THAT YOU WANT MORE THAN A KEVIN 
DAVIES 
IT WAS A FANTASTIC DAVIES PERFORMANCE HE IS CONSISTENTLY 
GOOD FOR US AND CONSISTENTLY WORKS 
HARD WHEN EVERYTHING CLICKS HE IS 
AS GOOD AS ANYONE 
HE PICKED UP A 
YELLOW CARD WHICH WOULD MEAN SHE 
WILL MISS TWO OF THE LAST FOUR 
GAMES WHICH MEANS HE WILL MISS 
TWO OF THE LAST FOUR GAMES 
I AM 
DISAPPOINTED AM DISAPPOINTED WITH 
THE YELLOW CARD L. THOUGHT THE 
BOOKING WAS WRONG 
THEY SCORED IN 
THE FORTY SIX MINUTE A TYPICAL BOLTON 
GOAL WE WERE LOOKING AROUND TO SEE 
IF PEOPLE HAD BEEN FILED BUT THE 
REFEREE GAVE IT THE GAME TURNED ON 
THAT AND WE CAME OUT AND STARTED 
PLAYING THE REFEREES DON'T GIVE US 
ENOUGH PROTECTION 
A YOU MIGHT HAVE 
TAKEN THE LEAD IN THE FIRST HALF 
HAS THE REFEREE CLARIFIED WHY IT 
WAS DISALLOWED 
I AM LED TO BELIEVE 
HE WAS OFFSIDE IT IS JUST ONE OF 
THOSE THAT CONFUSES EVERYONE ALL 
THE TIME THESE THINGS ARE A LOT 
EASIER TO BEAR WHEN THEY DO NOT 
DECIDE THE RESULT 
WE ARE NOT 
CONFUSED DO YOU FEEL THAT BOLTON 
WERE OVER PHYSICAL 
NO NOT AT ALL 
I THINK THEY HAVE GOT IT SUCCESSFUL 
WAY OF PLAYING THEY WERE POOR 
AGAINST ASTON VILLA LAST WEEK THEY 
GO BACK TO PLAYING THE WAY THEY 
KNOW IT IS BEST KEVIN DAVIES UP 
THERE IN THE BOX THEY PUT PRESSURE 
ON THEIR POSITION 
BOLTON HAVE HAD 
THREE SUCCESSIVE TOP EIGHT 
FINISHERS KEVIN DAVIES IS GOING TO 
BE VERY IMPORTANT 
THEY'RE GOING TO 
MISS HIM IN THE NEXT TWO GAMES HE 
WAS OUTSTANDING EVEN WHEN THE BALL 
GOES OVER HIS HEAD HIS ATTITUDE IS 
ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL HE GETS THE 
BALL AND THE BOX WHAT MORE DID 
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT HERE IS A 
LITTLE FLICK THE BALL GOES WIDE 
AND THERE ARE THREE DEFENDERS 
MARKING HIM BUT HE STILL GETS HIS 
HEAD ON IT HE JUMPS THREE 
DEFENDERS ANOTHER SHOT ON GOAL 
SEVEN AT IN THE BOX WATCH HOW HE 
CREATES A SPACE FOR HIMSELF HE 
GETS ANOTHER HEADER ON TARGET THE 
BALL GETS WHIPPED IN MAYBE A 
LITTLE PISH BUT WATCH MATTHEW'S 
RESPONSE HE IS GOING TO BE MISSED 
HE BRINGS PEOPLE INTO THE TEAM HE HE IS SO DIFFICULT TO PLAY AGAINST HE 
GETS HIMSELF IN A POSITION WHERE IT 
IS DIFFICULT TO GET THE BALL AWAY 
CLEANLY AND THAT HAS OLDMAN BE PUT 
PRESSURE ON THEIR POSITION 
HOW DO 
YOU THINK WE SHOULD JUDGE WEST HAM 
HEADING THE COVERAGE IS FANTASTIC 
IT IS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE 
SUPPORTERS AND ORDER HAS WANT MORE 
VICTORIES FOR THIRD BOTTOM BOLTON 
AND FULHAM BUT WHAT ABOUT THE TEAM 
FOURTH BOTTOM AT KICK OFF IT WAS 
BIRMINGHAM FOUR POINTS ABOVE THE 
RELEGATION PLACE AT HOME TO 
EVERTON WHO WERE HOPING TO DRAW 
LEVEL ON POINTS WITH FOURTH TOP 
LIVERPOOL GUY MOWBRAY WAS THE COMMENTATOR 
IT HAS BEEN THE LATEST TWIST IN A 
TURBULENT SEASON FOR BIRMINGHAM 
CITY THERE WAS PUBLIC QUESTIONING 
IN RELATION TO FINANCIAL AFFAIRS 
THAT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO AFFECT 
THE CLUB'S FIGHT TO STAY IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR 
BIRMINGHAM CITY WHERE IT MATTERS 
JAMES MCFADDEN BACK FROM INJURY AND 
BACK IN THE TEAM TO FACE HIS FORMER 
CLUB AND THERE IS AN OLD BOY IN 
THE EVERTON RANKS TOO ANDY 
JOHNSON UP AGAINST THE TEAM HE 
STARTED OUT WITH HE NEEDS ONE MORE 
LEAGUE GOAL TO MAKE IT ONE HUNDRED FERNANDEZ PROVED LAST WEEK AGAINST DERBY HE CAN PICK A PASS A CHANCE FOR BIRMINGHAM TO BREAK 
DECENT BALL IN HAD IT REACHED 
JAMES MACFADDEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
A GOOD CHANCE EXCELLENT CLAIM FROM 
THE EVERTON KEEPER HANDBALL APPEALS FROM BIRMINGHAM 
PLAYERS IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE 
DIFFICULT TO SCORE FROM THAT ANGLE 
SHE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO BE 
WATCHING A GAME OF FOOTBALL AFTER 
ALL HER PROBLEMS THIS WEEK YAKUBU HAS GOT AWAY WITH THAT 
BECAUSE HE WAS CAUGHT LATE IT IS 
AN EVERTON FREE KICK HE CAN ONLY FIND THE SIDE NETTING 
JOLEON LESCOTT FOR A CENTRAL 
DEFENDER HAS BEEN PROLIFIC THIS 
SEASON HE HAS SCORED EIGHT GOALS 
COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN A NINTH PUT 
BIRMINGHAM CITY IN A REAL MESS 
THERE THEY ALL LEFT IT TO ONE 
ANOTHER LESCOTT HASTY WITH HIS CLEARANCE DID FOUL MACFADDEN BUT HE HAS MANAGED TO WRIGGLE CLEAR NOT TOO PROBLEMATIC FOR THE EVERTON KEEPER GREAT STRENGTH SHOWN BY MACFADDEN 
HE MANAGED TO WITHSTAND TWO OR 
THREE FOULS TO HAVE A GO AT GOAL 
GOOD TO SEE THAT YAKUBU TRYING TO 
GET HIMSELF INVOLVED IN THE GAME 
NO CHANCES FOR HIM YET GREAT FOOTWORK FROM THE SCOTTISH INTERNATIONAL BIRMINGHAM WITH A CHANCE BACK ACROSS GOAL AND OFF THE POST 
IT IS A BIRMINGHAM CITY SUBSTITUTE 
WHO HAS COME CLOSEST TO SCORING SO 
FAR BUT IT HITS THE OUTSIDE OF THE 
POST SUPER LEAP JAMES MCFADDEN HAS LOOKED 
BIRMINGHAM'S BEST BET FOR A GOAL 
TODAY FLICK ACROSS GOAL AND OVER THE BAR 
WAS THAT LIAM RIDGEWELL JAIDI WAS 
IN THERE TOO FLICK ACROSS BY AN 
EVERTON HEAD IT WAS RIDGEWELL WHO 
SEES THE BALL BOUNCE OFF HIS BOOT 
AND OVER THE CROSSBAR ONE OF THOSE 
WHERE WE GLIBLY SAY IT IS EASY TO 
SCORE BUT HE MUST HAVE SEEN IT SO 
LATE GOOD BIT OF DEFENDING DISTRIBUTION 
NOT SO CLEVER FREE KICK GOES TO 
BIRMINGHAM CITY THIS IS JAIDI A GREAT SAVE BY 
HOWARD TWO BRILLIANT STOPS BY TIM 
HOWARD JAIDI DISPLAYED CENTRE FORWARD STRIKE INSTINCTS THERE SUPER EFFORT KEPT OUT LOOK HOW 
QUICKLY HOWARD IS BACK TO HIS FEET 
AND POISED AND READY TO DENY JAMES 
MCFADDEN MUST HAVE THOUGHT HE HAD 
SCORED AGAINST HIS OLD TEAM FINAL 
BIRMINGHAM CHANGE OF THE DAY IT IS 
THEIR MAN OF THE MOMENT COMING ON 
JAMES MCFADDEN HAS WORKED HARD NO 
SURPRISE TO SEE HIM NOT LAST IN 
HIS ABSENCE THIS MAN HAS BEEN 
SHINING AN ARGENTINIAN TWENTY ONE YEARS 
OLD THREE GOALS IN HIS LAST THREE 
GAMES DECENT TRY MAIK TAYLOR SHOVELS THE 
BALL BEHIND WASN'T EXACTLY A 
THUNDERBOLT A COUPLE OF SKIPS OFF 
THE TURF MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE 
BIRMINGHAM KEEPER THAT WAS A GOOD 
SAVE IT IS TURNED IN BY JOLEON LESCOTT 
HIS FIFTIETH GAME THIS SEASON FOR 
EVERTON HIS NINTH GOAL LEE CARSLEY 
KEEPS THE BALL IN AND KEPT HIS COOL 
TO CHIP IT BACK TO YAKUBU LOOK 
WHERE LESCOTT WAS HE HAS BEEN LIKE 
THAT ALL SEASON LONG POACHING 
GOALS GETS IN FRONT OF MCSHEFFREY 
AND IT IS A LOVELY FLICK INTO THE 
OPPOSITE CORNER THERE CRUEL LUCK 
FOR BIRMINGHAM CITY BIRMINGHAM REALLY WANT O'CONNOR IN 
THE MIDDLE HANDBALL FREE KICK 
RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE BOX LEE CARSLEY DEFINITELY TOOK HIM 
DOWN WITH HIS LEFT ARM MCFADDEN 
HAS EXITED STAGE RIGHT IN HIS 
PLACE CAME MAURO ZARATE AND IT 
LOOKS AS THOUGH HE WILL BE TAKING 
OVER FREE KICK RESPONSIBILITIES TOO IT IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT WHAT A 
CHANGE MADE BY ALEX MCLEISH WHAT 
WILL THAT DO TO CHANGE BIRMINGHAM 
CITY'S FORTUNES AT THE BOTTOM OF 
THE BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE THAT 
IS TOP NOTCH BY MAURO ZARATE FOUR 
GOALS IN FOUR GAMES FOUR HUGE 
GOALS IN THE CONTEXT OF BIRMINGHAM 
CITY'S FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL 
I THOUGHT WE DID WELL SECOND HALF 
WE DID LOT OF NEAR THINGS AND I 
THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT BE OUR DAY WE 
DEFENDED WELL BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS 
A CRUEL GAME BUT WE NEVER GAVE UP 
WE KEPT ENCOURAGING THE PLAYERS 
FROM THE SIDELINES WE GOT AN 
EQUALISER AND THAT POINT COULD 
KEEP US IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
SHOULD THAT GOAL HAVE BEEN TWO OR 
DID YOU NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT 
OBVIOUSLY I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN TWO BUT I DID NOT SEE TOO 
MUCH I JUST TRIED TO GET SOMETHING 
ON IT GOT TOO MUCH OF A GOOD CONTACT 
TELL US ABOUT YOUR GOALS CONTACT TALLY THIS SEASON NINE NOW YOU 
WOULD NOT HAVE GOT GOOD ODDS ON 
THAT AT THE START OF THE SEASON 
YEAH BUT WE HAVE NOT KEPT CLEAN 
SHEETS TODAY 
THE KID WAS BURSTING 
TO PLAY AND HE WAS DISAPPOINTED 
WHEN I SAID HE WOULD BE ON THE 
BENCH HE HAS GOT A BIG HEART AND 
HE IS A TERRIFIC PLAYER BIRMINGHAM BIRMINGHAM FOUGHT VERY HARD SCORED A VERY 
GOOD FREE KICK ALBEIT I THOUGHT 
THERE WAS A FOUL ON YAKUBU IN THE 
BUILD UP TO IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR 
REFEREES NOWADAYS TO MAKE DECISIONS 
BUT THE CROWD PLAYED THEIR PART 
HERE TODAY 
THE SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE 
FOR BIRMINGHAM IF THEY HAD NOT 
EQUALISED 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN THEY EQUALISED SHOWED A LOT OF DETERMINATION TO 
COME BACK AGAINST WHAT WERE A GOOD 
EVERTON SIDE THE FIRST HALF TO ME 
WAS A BORE BUT IT LIVENED UP IN 
THE SECOND HALF BIRMINGHAM MIGHT 
HAVE EDGED IT MOYES HAS DONE A 
GREAT JOB BUT EVERTON HAVE THE 
BEST DEFENSIVE RECORD YOU DO NOT 
WANT TO COME UP AGAINST A TEAM THAT 
IN GOAL IS ULTRA CONFIDENT THIS 
WAS EARLY ON IT LOOKS EASY BUT 
THAT IS HARD TO TAKE HE IS 
HANDLING IT UNDER PRESSURE BUT 
SUPREMELY CONFIDENT LINES UP THE 
WALL STANDS THE OTHER SIDE HE 
DOES NOT MOVE UNTIL HE KNOWS 
EXACTLY WHERE IT HAS GONE THEN 
SAVES THE BEST FOR LAST GREAT SAVE 
THERE BUT HIS REACTION WAS 
TERRIFIC HE IS UP QUICK THAT WAS 
A BRILLIANT SAVE TREMENDOUS 
GOALKEEPING 
IT IS A MARK OF GOALKEEPING BIRMINGHAM DOING WELL TO MAKE SAVES 
LIKE THAT WHAT GOT BIRMINGHAM BACK 
IN THE GAME 
THEY MISSED A GILT 
EDGED CHANCE THEY SCORED TWO GOALS 
AGAINST MANCHESTER CITY THERE WAS 
AN EASY CHANCE THAT HE MISSED EVEN 
LEE DIXON WOULD HAVE PUT THAT ONE 
IN MAURO ZARATE IS LIVELY BRIGHT 
AND GOOD WITH THE BALL 
AND HE WAS A THREAT HE GOES PAST 
NEVILLE IT WAS A FANTASTIC BALL TO 
THE BACK LESCOTT DID WELL TO CLEAR 
IT HE HOLDS THE CHALLENGE OFF AND 
PLAYS IT NICE AND EASY 
THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER IT 
WAS FANTASTIC PLAY THERE WAS A 
DEFINITE HANDBALL FROM CARSLEY NO 
MATTER WHAT DAVID MOYES SAYS 
THE WHAT YOU WATCH THE WALL IT 
JUST BREAKS 
INTERESTING WHAT ALEX 
MCLEISH SAID ABOUT HIM THE FORM 
LIKE THAT SHOWS HE HAS GOT 
SOMETHING IN HIS HEART HE DID NOT 
SOCK HE HE CAME OUT AND PERFORMED 
SULK 
THAT IS WHAT A MANAGER 
LOVES 
DO NOT GET ME GOING ON LOVES INTERFERING WITH PLAY AS FAR AS 
EVERTON AND BIRMINGHAM ARE 
CONCERNED DO YOU REMEMBER LAST 
YEAR THEY HAD TO GET THEMSELVES OUT 
OF TROUBLE KENNY HELP THEM 
IT IS 
THE SAME SORT OF THING GOALS GET 
TO THREE POINTS HE SCORED TWO 
AGAINST MANCHESTER CITY HE COULD 
GET THEM OUT OF TROUBLE 
HE IS 
YOUNG AND HE IS BUBBLING YOU'RE YOU'RE BETTER HAVING THE POINTS ON THE 
BOARD FULHAM WERE DEAD AND BURIED 
WHEN THEY WERE BEATEN AT SAINT JAMES'S 
PARK WIGAN ARE 
STILL IN IT L. STILL THINK BECAUSE READING WHEN A 
LOT OF MATCHES THEY WILL BE ALL 
RIGHT 
BIRMINGHAM HAVE GOT A VILLA RIGHT AWAY SEE THE GOAL DIFFERENCE THERE 
FOR VILLA AND READING A BIG GAME 
COMING UP ON THE THIRD MAY THERE ARE 
TO CENTRE AND TO COME

CANNOT TELL ME HE IS NOT GIVEN 
CANNOT TELL ME WHY HE IS NOT GIVEN 
THE OFF SIDE HE IS RIGHT AND THE 
LINE OF SIGHT PLUS WE CAN CONFIRM 
THE BEST BIT IS HERE IT HITS OF 
HIM IT IS INCREDIBLE HOW THAT 
CALLS STILL STANDS 
TO FOLLOW THAT 
UP THIS IS THE GOAL THAT DID NOT 
STAND NOT OFFSIDE AGAIN NO ONE IN 
THE MIDDLE ON THE OFFSIDE POSITION 
THE REFEREE LOOKS AT THE LINESMAN 
WHOSE FLAG AND HE GIVES THE FLAG 
FOR INTERFERING HE HAS IMPEDED THE 
GOAL 
THE OFFICIALS HAVE GOT A HARD GOAL JOB THE RUN NINETY FIVE CAMERAS BUT THE 
OLD OFFSIDE LAW IT WAS BLACK AND 
WHITE THIS FUND IS DOWN TO 
INTERPRETATION AND TIME AND TIME 
AGAIN YOU CAN GIVE ME AN INCIDENT 
AND I WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING 
TO HAPPEN WITH THAT INCIDENT I I WILL BE INDEBTED TO SEE WHETHER THE 
TWO REFEREES THERE IF YOU SWAP 
THEM OVER AND THEY HAD AN OPINION 
ON EACH OTHER'S DECISION WHAT THEY 
WOULD SAY THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY 
AGREE BECAUSE THEY HAVE BOTH GONE 
THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION 
THE REWARD 
HIS SUCCESS AND A PENALTY IS FOR 
FAILURE 
THE REWARDS FOR SUCCESS AND THE 
PENALTIES FOR FAILURE ARE SO LARGE 
NOW 
IT COULD MATTER IN A COUPLE OF NOW WEEKS' TIME 
THE INTERPRETATION OF 
AN INDIVIDUAL REFEREE COULD REALLY 
SHAPE THE SEASON 
EVERYBODY WANTS 
CLARITY IF YOU ARE A PLAYER 
MANAGER OR SUPPORTER YOU WANT 
CLARITY EVERYBODY WANTS CLARITY 
NEXT SUNDERLAND VERSUS MANCHESTER 
CITY SUNDERLAND'S RELEGATION FEARS 
WERE ALL BUT GONE AFTER THREE 
SUCCESSIVE WINS THE NEXT STEP TO 
FINISH OFF NEWCASTLE THEY PLAY

INTO THE MATCH WITH ONLY ONE WIN IN 
SEVEN REWARDED FOR HIS GOAL AT FULHAM 
LAST WEEKEND MICHAEL CHOPRA IS 
GIVEN START TODAY SUN JIHAI IS DRAFTED IN CRIES OF MAN ON WHICH HE 
MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HEARD BLOCKED OFF BY 
SUN JIHAI FREE KICK TO SUNDERLAND 
WHICH ANDY REED IS THE ORCHESTRATOR 
OF JONES CLAIMED HE HAD A SHIRT PULLED HE DEFINITELY DID IT IS A RACE AND IT IS WON BY 
KENWYNE JONES AND STOPPED BY JOE 
HART ONCE HE 
WAS GIVEN ON IT WAS A STRAIGHT RACE TEST OF PACE 
AND UPPER BODY STRENGTH KENWYNE 
JONES HAD BOTH JONES TRYING TO BUSTLE HIS WAY UP 
THE LEFT HAND SIDE IT IS BACK 
TOWARDS JONES MURPHY WAS SHAPING 
WITH HIS BODY TO TRY AND THEN WON 
IN THE FAR CORNER BUT HE GOT IT 
ALL WRONG AND ENDED UP HITTING IT 
HIGH AND HANDSOME MORE LIKE HIGH 
AND UGLY AND IT IS A PENALTY AWARDED FOR 
THE CHALLENGE IT IS A YELLOW CARD 
FOR NOSWORTHY AND I AM NOT SURE NOSWORTHY TOUCHED 
HIM I DO NOT THINK NOSWORTHY 
TOUCHED HIM MIKE REILLY THOUGHT HE 
DID AND AWARDS THE PENALTY AT 
HIGH SPEED MIKE RILEY FELT THERE 
WAS A CLIPPING OF THE HEELS MY 
GOODNESS IT WAS THE SLIGHTEST IF 
IT WAS AT ALL 
MANCHESTER CITY HAVE A BONUS HERE MANCHESTER CITY'S TOP SCORER MAY 
WELL HAVE GIVEN MANCHESTER CITY AN 
AWAY WIN AT SUNDERLAND A GAME OF 
SO FEW CHANCES COOL AS YOU LIKE 
THAT WAS THEIR FIRST SHOT ON TARGET 
PALMER BY MY RECKONING SOME SUNDERLAND FANS ARE BOOING SUNDERLAND LOOK FOR AN EQUALISER A 
GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND A SUPER 
STRIKE AS WELL FROM THE CAPTAIN 
HIS FIRST GOAL IN THE SEASON 
MANCHESTER CITY WERE AHEAD FOR ONLY 
A MATTER OF MOMENTS NOSWORTHY HAS 
COME HALF THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD 
TO SAY THANK YOU TO HIS SKIPPER 
SUNDERLAND WILL SAY JUSTICE HAS 
BEEN DONE WELL WORKED GOAL WORKED 
IT FROM RIGHT SIDE TO LEFT THE 
CROSS WAS INVITING INTO THE CORNER 
A WONDERFUL GOAL SUNDERLAND LEVEL STURRIDGE HAS HAD TO COME OFF AND 
DARIUS VASSELL HAS COME ON INSTEAD 
SUDDENLY THIS GAME WHICH LOOKED 
LIKE IT WAS ENDING GOALLESS HAS 
TWO GOALS IN JUST A FEW MINUTES 
AND THE WHOLE COMPLEXION OF IT HAS 
CHANGED HERE IS SOLANO GOODNESS 
ME SHOULD HAVE SCORED AND HE 
KNOWS IT HANDS ON HEAD SAYS IT ALL HERE IS DARIUS VASSELL AND HE HAS 
WON IT L. HAD BETTER NOT SAY THAT 
BUT HE HAS CERTAINLY PUT MANCHESTER 
CITY AHEAD FOR THE SECOND TIME 
SUDDENLY THEY HAVE SCORED TWO 
GOALS ALBEIT THE FIRST ONE 
CANCELLED OUT IT ALMOST APOLOGISES AS IT CROSSES 
THE LINE MANCHESTER CITY ARE AHEAD 
FOR THE SECOND TIME WHERE DID THIS 
GAME COME FROM VASSELL IS OFFSIDE BUT THE FREE 
KICK IS AWARDED FOR THE CHALLENGE 
EARLIER ON JOHNSON HE HAS HIT IT WELL THAT WAS A WONDERFUL SECOND SAVE HIS REACTION TO BLOCK OFF BENJANI WAS TERRIFIC 
VERY HAPPY TODAY AND A BIT LUCKY 
AS WELL MAYBE THE PENALTY WAS A 
BIT TOUGH IT CAN BE A PENALTY OR 
ONE NOT BE A PENALTY 
WILL PITY YOU 
ARE NOT SURE UNTIL AFTERWARDS IN 
HINDSIGHT IT IS EASY TO LOOK OUT 
ON VIDEO CLEARLY IT WAS NOT A 
PENALTY BUT WE ACCEPT THE 
REFEREE'S DECISION 
THE WINNING 
GOAL VASSEL I THINK IT WAS 
COMPLETELY MISSED BUT IT WENT IN 
IT WAS A CRISIS OF A GOAL THE BALL 
CAME THE OPPOSITE WAY I WANTED IT 
I MANAGE TO MANY BRIT INTO POSITION 
IT HAS GONE IN AND IT IS GOOD FOR 
THE FANS AND THE TEAM 
STILL TO COME PORTSMOUTH VERSUS 
NEWCASTLE FIRST THE HIGHLIGHTS OF 
THE GAME BETWEEN TOTTENHAM AND 
MIDDLESBROUGH BORO ARRIVED AT 
WHITE HART LANE HAVING LOST ONE OF 
THEIR LAST FIVE GAMES JONATHAN WOODGATE JOINS TOTTENHAM 
FROM MIDDLESBROUGH IN JANUARY HE 
HAS SCORED TWO GOALS FOR TOTTENHAM 
SO FAR BOTH AGAINST CHELSEA ONE 
IN THE CARLING CUP FINAL 
MIDDLESBROUGH MAY HAVE GIVEN 
MANCHESTER UNITED A RUN FOR THEIR 
MONEY LAST WEEKEND BUT GARETH 
SOUTHGATE'S TEAM HAVE YET TO WIN A 
LEAGUE GAME AWAY FROM HOME IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT POGATETZ IS NAMED AS MIDDLESBROUGH CAPTAIN THAT IS ALIADIERE THE LINESMAN'S FLAG IS RAISED THAT MIGHT WELL HAVE PLAYED HIM ON SIDE BERBATOV ALMOST PERFECT FROM 
TOTTENHAM DIMITAR BERBATOV 
CERTAINLY ENJOYS PLAYING AGAINST 
MIDDLESBROUGH THIS IS HIS FOURTH 
APPEARANCE AGAINST THEM HE HAS 
SCORED IN TWO OUT OF THREE SO FAR THIS RUN IS GOING ALL 
THE WAY INTO THE AREA A BRAVE SAVE FROM MARK SCHWARZER JERMAINE JENAS HAS HAD THE BEST 
CHANCE SO FAR FOR TOTTENHAM HE HAS 
CREATED THEM ALL ON HIS OWN PUT 
THE HEAD DOWN TURNED ON THE 
AFTERBURNERS LOOK AT THE PACE HERE FROM JENAS 
COMING FROM AN ONSIDE POSITION 
POGATETZ DID VERY WELL TO RECOVER 
A CHANCE MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE FOR 
BERBATOV IT IS IN OFF THE 
DEFENDER AARON LENNON CELEBRATES 
BUT THE LAST TOUCH CAME OFF 
JONATHAN BRAND BROWN GREAT 
AWARENESS FROM BERBATOV TO SEND IN 
THE CROSS BERBATOV SPOTTED LENNON 
WAS AT THE FAR POST NOT MUCH 
BROWNS COULD DO ABOUT IT IN THE END 
BERBATOV HAD SUCH ACCURACY HE WAS 
LIKE A GOLFER CHIPPING ON TO THE 
RIGHT PART OF THE GREEN AND ROBBIE 
KEANE WAS BEHIND HIM ANYWAY THE BRAZILIAN HAD NOT ANTICIPATED 
THAT THIS WAS NEARLY A TURNING 
POINT IN THE GAME O'NEILL'S CORNER HEADED OFF THE LINE BY 
LENNON THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD CORNER THIS BERBATOV GIVES IT BACK TO AARON LENNON BERBATOV OFF THE POST 
TOOK A DEFLECTION AND IT FOOLED 
MARK SCHWARZER THEY WERE SO CLOSE 
TO SECOND GOAL DIMITAR BERBATOV 
LOOKING FOR HIS TWENTY THIRD GOAL OF THE 
SEASON IT CAME OFF POGATETZ BUT 
YOU CAN BE SURE BERBATOV WOULD HAVE 
CLAIMED IT HAD GONE IN HE WAS 
ACTUALLY APPEALING IT CAME OFF THE 
ARM OF THE AUSTRIAN DEFENDER DOWNING GOES FOR A GOAL HIMSELF IT 
MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A DEFLECTION BUT 
THE KEEPER KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT 
UNTIL IT WAS IN THE BACK OF THE NET 
STEWART DOWNING IS MIDDLESBROUGH'S 
TOP SCORER IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
THIS SEASON THIS IS HIS EIGHTH OF 
THE CAMPAIGN IT DEFINITELY TOOK A 
DEFLECTION OFF THE HEAD OF JERMAINE 
JENAS AND ONCE AGAIN TOTTENHAM 
HOTSPUR LET A LEAD SLIP IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE QUITE A WHILE SINCE TOTTENHAM HAVE 
ROUSED ANYTHING YOU WOULD DESCRIBE 
AS BEING AN ATTACK DO NOT THINK 
THAT FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY 
EITHER THIS ONE WAS JUST WIDE 
THE PROBLEM WE HAD FOR A FEW WEEKS 
AS SOON AS WE GO ONE TO ZERO UP IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO FINISH THE GAME AND 
SCORE THE SECOND GOAL WE KEEP 
PLAYING THE SAME WAY SOMETIMES WE 
DO NOT FINISH THE GAME SOMETIMES 
IT IS BECAUSE OF THE OPPOSITION 
TODAY THEY PUT US UNDER PRESSURE 
FOR AT HALF WE DID NOT SHOW 
FIRST HALF WE DID NOT POSE ENOUGH 
OF A THREAT GOING FORWARD WE WERE 
FORTUNATE TO BE JUST ONE GOAL 
BEHIND 
BERBATOV HAD 
THAT CHANCE BEHIND THAT CAME OFF THE POST HIS BODY 
LANGUAGE IN THE FIRST HALF YOU 
COULD SEE HE WAS ENJOYING THE GAME 
ARE YOU HAPPY THAT HE IS ENJOYING 
HIS FOOTBALL 
HIS GREAT WE KNOW 
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO MAKE HIM 
HAPPY BUT SOMETIMES THE OTHER SIDE 
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO 
GIVE US SOMETHING BECAUSE WE 
CANNOT PLAY NINETY MINUTES PASSING GAME 
WAS PLEASED WITH THE RESPONSE WE 
GOT IN THE SECOND HALF THE PLAYERS 
SHOULD TAKE CREDIT BECAUSE WE 
MIGHT HAVE WON THE GAME HARRY REDKNAPP COULD HAVE BEEN HERE 
TODAY AS NEWCASTLE MANAGER 
JERMAINE DEFOE RETURNING TO THE 
PORTSMOUTH TEAM WORK OR AN'S FORM 
HAS REVITALISED THE SIDE MARK HE HAS MISSED IT COMPLETELY IT IS 
A CORNER KICK HE CAN AFFORD TO 
SMILE THIS COULD HAVE BEEN VERY 
COSTLY INDEED DAVID JAMES HAS KEPT 
FIFTEEN CLEAN SHEETS THIS SEASON IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE WHO LEAGUE THEY HAVE DRAWN MORE HOME GAMES 
THAN ANY OTHER CLUB IN THE LEAGUE 
THAT WILL SURELY BE YELLOW CARD 
JOHNSON DESPERATELY TRYING TO MAKE 
UP LOST GROUND NO CONTACT WITH THE 
BALL PLENTY BUT THE NEWCASTLE MAN 
WITH JAMES HAD TO CLUTCH AT THAT 
ONE ORWIN COULD NOT QUITE GET 
ATTACHED TO IT MICHAEL OWEN 
JUST WATCHED THE BALL WHAT A GOOD CHANCE THAT WAS THE 
NEWCASTLE ON THE BREAK TO BE FAIR TO TAYLOR THE SHOT HITS 
IS FIT AND THEN COMES UP TO HIT HIS 
ARM BUT IT CERTAINLY STRUCK THE 
HAND OF TAYLOR NO WAY SHOULD THAT 
BE A PENALTY GERMAINE BEFORE JERMAINE DEFOE 
SUCH AN INFORM AT THE 
MOMENT EIGHT GOALS IN SEVEN 
APPEARANCES THE ANGLE IS TIGHT THAT WAS AN 
EXCELLENT SAVE BY DAVID JAMES WAS HEADING IN A DEFLECTION A SUPER MOVE FROM 
PORTSMOUTH DEFLECTION OFF 
JERMAINE DEFOE COULD HAVE GONE 
ANYWHERE FOR SURELY FOR NEWCASTLE 
IT GOES HIGH AND WIDE GERMAINE 
BEFORE J. E. ME BEFORE J. E. ME 
BEFORE IT JUST CLIPPED THE HEELS OF ENRIQUE MARTENS HE DOES WHEN A 
CORNER WIN A CORNER NEWCASTLE'S CORNER COUNT 
REACHES DOUBLE FIGURES AN AWKWARD 
BOUNCE IT WAS PUT OVER BY MICHAEL 
OWEN THE FORMER NEWCASTLE DEFENDER 
TONY IT STRAIGHT INTO THE PATH OF 
AUDEN TONY IT STRAIGHT INTO THE 
PATH OF MICHAEL OWEN TURNING 
WHAT A GOOD SAVE THAT IS IT JUST 
COMES OFF HIS HEAD HE TRIES HIS LUCK FROM DISTANCE 
THAT IS FLYING SAVE FROM JAMES 
PORTSMOUTH WERE JUST TWO SHOTS ON 
TARGET THIS AFTERNOON THEY MISS 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
CLAW BACK FEW 
POINTS 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLAW BACK A FEW POINTS IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH WEEK 
BUT A GREAT WEEK FOR US WE HAVEN'T 
CONCEDED A GOAL ALL WEEK SO I AM 
DELIGHTED WITH THE ATTITUDE OF THE 
PLAYERS 
I THINK APPOINT DOWN HE PLAYERS WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A GOOD 
RESULT THEY'RE NOT IN THE CUP 
FINAL FOR NOTHING THEY HAVE NOT 
KEPT FIFTEEN SIXTEEN CLEAN SHEETS FOR 
NOTHING I THINK IT IS A GOOD POINT 
FOR US 
APPROACHING SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY GAMES TWENTY 
YEARS INTO HIS CAREER DAVID JAMES 
IS HEADING THEM OVER THE BAR THAT THAT WAS A FANTASTIC SAVE HE HAS AN 
INTEGRAL PART OF THE CLUB AND THEIR 
SUCCESS 
WELL DONE DAVID JAMES SUCCESS WELL DONE HARRY REDKNAPP FOR 
SAYING THAT ALL THAT MATTERS TO HIM 
IS WINNING THE CUP 
HERE IS THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE DERBY COUNTY ARE ALREADY RELEGATED 
AND THAT'S IT TIME TO GO THENCE 
TO ALAN AND LEAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
THOUGHT BOLTON AND FULHAM WERE DOWN 
AND OUT BUT BOTH HAVE EVERY 
INTENTION OF STAYING UP FOR NOW
