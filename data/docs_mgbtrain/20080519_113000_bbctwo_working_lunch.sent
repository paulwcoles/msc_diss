MONDAY'S WORKING LUNCH ANOTHER DAY 
ANOTHER WARNING OVER HOUSE PRICES 
BUT WHERE DO THESE SURVEYS COME 
FROM AND HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU TRUST 
WHAT THEY SAY ANYWAY TODAY THE 
WORKING LUNCH SURVIVAL GUIDE TO 
HOUSE PRICE REDICTIONS ALSO 
LIVING LONGER BUT WHERE WILL HELP 
COME FROM FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO 
STAY IN THEIR OWN HOMES 
AND HOLIDAY PLANNING THE BEST 
DEALS ON THE CARDS FOR YOUR SUMMER 
MONEY MONEY BUT FIRST THE MARKETS THE SELF 
STORAGE COMPANY DID I SAY SOFT 
STORAGE COMPANY THE 
SE F. STORAGE 
COMPANY BIG YELLOW SAID TOUGH 
CONDITIONS WOULD CONTINUE FOR 
SOMETIME WITH THE FIRM SAYING IT 
WOULD HOPE TO CAPITALISE BY 
SNAPPING UP LAND REDUCED FOR 
STORAGE SITES 
IT REPORTED UNDERLYING FULL YEAR 
PRE TAX PROFITS OF THIRTEEN POINT THREE MILLION 
DOWN 
PRE TAX PROFITS OF THIRTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOWN SIX PER CENT LET'S LOOK AT WHAT IT HAS 
DONE TO ITS SHARES IT'S DOWN 
THAT'S DOWN JUST OVER THIRTY FIVE PER CENT 
ELSEWHERE IT IS INTERESTING 
BRITISH AIRWAYS ARE DOWN THIRTEEN P. THEY 
WERE ONE OF THE BIGGEST FALLERS I 
SAW AMONGST THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED TODAY 
THERE DOESN'T SEEM A PRECISE REASON 
WHY THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED 
HOWEVER I THINK THE REASON BEHIND 
THAT IS THAT THEIR BROKER 
DOWNGRAINED PROFESSIONALS IN THE 
MARKET PUTTING DOWN PREDICTIONS FOR 
THIS COUNTRY SAYING IT WASN'T AS 
OPTIMISTIC AS THEY PREVIOUSLY HOPED 
ELSEWHERE YOU CAN SEE THE MARKET 
BEING PULLED IN TWO DIFFERENT 
DIRECTIONS ANGLO AMERICAN TELLS A 
STORY BECAUSE THE MINING SECTOR IS 
PARTICULARLY STRONG TODAY 
ELSEWHERE M. AND AMP S. UP VODAFONE UP 
UNITED UTILITIES UP U. K. COAL SAYS 
THE OUTLOOK THIS YEAR REMAINS 
POSITIVE AND IT REMAINS CONFIDENT 
OF MEETING ITS EXPECTATIONS FOR THE 
FULL YEAR ITS SHARES ARE UP THREE PER CENT IN 
FACT THIS IS WHAT I WAS SAYING A 
MOMENT AGO THE MINING SECTOR HAS 
BEEN STRONG TODAY MOST OF THE 
LEADING F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED PERFORMERS ARE 
MINING COMPANIES OUT OF THE TOP 
TEN ABOUT EIGHT WERE OUT OF THAT 
SECTOR THAT'S A BIT OF STRENGTH 
AND IT'S BOOSTING THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED 
HOWEVER ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT 
COIN THE BANKS HAVE HAD A WEAK 
MORNING ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND WAS 
ONE OF THE WORST PERFORMING 
COMPANIES AMONGST THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED 
IT'S DOWN SIXTY PER CENT SORRY SIX PER CENT AND 
THEY'RE NOT ALONE 
HOME SERVE REPORTED FULL YEAR 
UNDERLYING PROFITS ACTUALLY VERY 
GOOD JUST OVER EIGHTY FIVE MILLION MORE 
SIGNIFICANT LITTLE YOU'LL SEE THE 
RISE IS JUST A GREAT RISE TWENTY FIVE PER CENT UP 
EVEN THAT LOOK AT THAT THAT'S A 
BIG FALL SIX PER CENT DOWN I'M AFRAID 
THAT'S A CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE 
COMPANY SAW FULL YEAR PROFITS JUMP 
TWENTY PER CENT AS ALL ITS DIVISIONS POSTED 
GROWTH AND SAID IT WAS WELL PLACED 
TO BENEFIT FROM THE ECONOMIC 
CONDITIONS AT THE MOMENT WELL 
THAT'S INTERESTING 
THEY'RE DOWN ABOUT FOUR PER CENT 
AND JOHN WOOD WHICH IS AN OIL 
SERVICES COMPANY IT'S A 
FACILITATOR IN THIS INDUSTRY AND 
IT'S A BOOMING INDUSTRY IT SAYS 
IT'S MADE A GOOD START TO THE YEAR 
AND EXPECTS TO BE SOMEWHAT AHEAD OF 
EXPECTATIONS THANKS TO CONTINUING 
STRONG GLOBAL ENERGY MARKET ITS 
SHARES ARE UP ALTHOUGH NOT 
SIGNIFICANTLY ONLY ONE PER CENT LET'S HAVE 
A LOOK AT THE F. T. S. E. 
IT'S UP EIGHT PER CENT PERILS 
EIGHT PER CENT 
RICHARD HUNTER FROM HARGREAVES 
LANSDOWNE JOINS US FROM THE STOCK 
EXCHANGE EXCHANGE RICHARD WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT'S 
GOING ON IN THE MARKET 
IT'S A VERY 
IT'S A VERY CAUTIOUS ONE QUIET IN TERMS OF 
TRADING VOLUMES OBVIOUSLY THAT'S 
SHRIEBGLY TO GET WORSE RATHER THAN 
BETTER LIKELY TO GET WORSE RATHER 
THAN BETTER AS WE MOVE INTO THE 
SUMMER MONTHS WE'VE HAD A 
REASONABLY STRONG COUPLE OF WEEKS 
THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IS ONLY A COUPLE OF 
PER CENT DOWN FOR THE YEAR A 
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO IT WAS MORE 
LIKE FOURTEEN PER CENT TO FIFTEEN PER CENT 
THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT 
RECOVERY ONE OF THE CONFUSING 
THINGS IT COMES TO THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IS 
THAT IT ISN'T NECESSARILY A GOOD 
BAROMETER FOR THE U. K. BE ECONOMY 
BECAUSE A LOT OF PROBABLY THIRTY PER CENT PLUS 
OF THE INDEX IS SIMPLY MADE UP 
FROM THE MINING COMPANIES AND THE 
OIL COMPANIES IN TERMS OF THE 
WIDER PICTURE YOU TEND TO LOOK AT 
THE F. T. S. E. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WHEN IT COMES TO 
DISCUSSING THE U. K. ECONOMY 
YOU TALKED ABOUT QUIET SUMMER 
HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU FOR INVESTORS 
WHO ARE STUCK IN THE STOCK MARKET 
AT THE MOMENT 
THE DIFFICULTY WE'VE 
GOT IS THAT ALL AROUND 
UNFORTUNATELY THE SUB PRIME FALL 
OUT FROM THE U. S. WHICH WE SPOKE 
ABOUT MANY TIMES BEFORE AND THE 
ENSUING CREDIT CRUNCH 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT COME 
JANUARY OR FEBRUARY IT WAS STARTING 
TO LOOK LIKE MAYBE A LOT OF THE BAD 
NEWS HAD COME OUT ON THE TABLE WE 
THEN HAD MORE WRITEDOWN SOME 
CREDIT SUISSE IN THE U. K. WE HAD 
MASSIVE CASH CALLS FROM RBS AND 
HBOS EVEN BARCLAYS LAST WEEK 
WRITING DOWN MORE THAN A BILLION 
POUNDS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER 
ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE SOME LIGHT AT 
THE END OF THE TUNNEL IN TERMS OF 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH WE'RE NOT THERE 
YET WHILE THAT UNCERTAINTY REMAINS 
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THE MARKET 
TO MOVE ON INTO ITS NEXT LEG 
THANK YOU 
ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER HOUSING PRICE 
SURVEY ACCORDING TO THE PROPERTY 
WEBSITE RIGHT MOVE ASKING PRICES 
ARE ACTUALLY UP DESPITE EVERYTHING 
YOU HEAR THEY'RE UP TWO PER CENT ON YEAR 
AGO BUT WAVING MORE STATISTICS AT 
US TODAY THE ROYAL INSTITUTION OF 
CHARTERED SURVEYORS RECKONS THE 
NUMBER OF HOUSE SALES COULD DROP BY 
AN ASTOUNDING FORTY PER CENT BY THE END OF 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HOW ON EARTH CAN WE KNOW 
WHAT'S HAPPENING OT MARKET AND 
WHICH NUMBERS SHOULD WE BELIEVE 
HERE IS RACHEL'S BLUFFER'S GUIDE 
TODAY'S SURVEY FROM PROPERTY 
WEBSITE RIGHT MOVE SAYS THE AVERAGE 
ASKING PRICE FOR PROPERTY IN THE 
U. K. HAS RISEN BY TWENTY TWO PER CENT SINCE LAST 
YEAR TO AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO FIVE HUNDRED 
OTHER SURVEYS HAVE TOLD US HOUSE 
PRICES ARE FALLING WHY ARE ASKING 
PRICES RISING 
THE SIGNS ARE THAT 
THE TRANSACTIONS GOING THROUGH ARE 
AT LOWER PRICES MOST OF THE 
INDICIES ARE SHOWING SMALL FALLS AT 
THIS STAGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 
ONE PER CENT TO TWO PER CENT WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH 
THE RIGHT MOVE INDEX IS A 
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TYPE OF INDEX 
WHICH LOOKS AT ASKING PRICES 
ASKING PRICES ESPECIALLY AT THIS 
TIME OF YEAR BEGINNING OF THE 
SELLING SEASON TEND FOB WELL AHEAD 
OF WHAT LAST YEAR'S TO BE WELL 
AHEAD OF WHAT LAST YEAR'S WERE YOU 
HAVE TO LOOK CAREFULLY AT MONTHLY 
CHANGES BUT THERE ARE TWO THINGS 
THAT WORK HEERPL ONE IS THAT 
ASKING PRICES ARE PROBABLY NOT 
NEARLY AS FAR AHEAD AS THEY WOULD 
HAVE BEEN LAST YEAR THE OTHER 
THING IS THAT PEOPLE MAY BE 
NEGOTIATING ASKING A HIGHER PRICE 
IN THE EXPECTATION THAT IT'S GOING 
TO BE KNOCKED BACK TO A DISCOUNT 
RIGHT MOVE WEREN'T THE ONLY BODY 
RELEASING HOUSING MARKET STATISTICS 
THIS WEEKEND THE ROYAL INSTITUTION 
OF CHARTERED SURVEYORS ISSUED A 
WARNING THAT PROPERTY SALES COULD 
BE DOWN FORTY PER CENT AND PRICES DOWN BY FIVE PER CENT 
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR 
NOT GOOD NEWS FOR HOMEOWNERS BUT 
IT SEEMS EVERY DAY IT BRINGS A NEW 
SET OF HOUSING MARKET FIGURES 
WHETHER IT'S FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
FROM LENDERS OR ESTATE AGENTS 
WARNING US THAT THE MARKET IS UP 
IT'S DOWN WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF 
CRASH OR MERELY A PRICE CORRECTION 
WHERE ARE ALL THESE FIGURES COMING 
FROM AND DO THEY MEAN ANYTHING 
THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF BODIES 
WHICH ISSUE HOUSING MARKET FIGURES 
BUT LET'S LOOK AT THREE OF THE MOST 
WIDELY RECOGNISED INDICIES ISSUED 
BY THE HALIFAX LAND REGISTRY AND 
THE ROYAL INSTITUTION OF CHARTERED 
SURVEYORS OR RICS HALIFAX SAY 
HOUSE PRICES FELL BY JUST OVER ONE PER CENT 
IN APRIL THEY TAKE THEIR FIGURES 
FROM MORTGAGE VALUATIONS AT THE 
POINT WHEN THEY'RE APPROVED BY THE 
BUILDING SOCIETY OR BANK THEY'VE 
BEEN COLLECTING THIS INFORMATION 
FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND USE A SAMPLE SIZE 
OF AROUND FIFTEEN THOUSAND APPROVALS 
THE LAND REGISTRY HAS BEEN LOOKING 
AT FIGURES SINCE TWO THOUSAND THEY SAY 
MONTHLY PRICES ARE DOWN BY OH FOUR PER CENT 
THEY LOOK AT ALL FINAL SALES 
FIGURES ON THE FACE OF IT THESE 
LOOK LIKE THE MOST ACCURATE BUT 
BECAUSE A PRICE IS OFTEN AGREED 
MONTHS BEFORE THE SALE IS COMPLETE 
THEY GIVE A GOOD INDICATION OF 
WHERE THE MARKET WAS NUMBER OF 
MONTHS AGO NOT NECESSARILY TRUE 
REFLECTION OF HOW THINGS ARE TODAY 
RICS HAVE BEEN TRACKING ESTATE 
AGENTS' VIEWS ON HOUSE PRICES SINCE 
NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THEY USE SAMPLE OF THREE HUNDRED 
AGENCIES AND SAY ALMOST TWICE AS 
MANY THINK PRICES ARE FALLING 
RATHER THAN RISING ALTHOUGH IT'S 
MORE A SURVEY OF SENTIMENT THAN 
NUMBERS THEIR INFORMATION IS USED 
BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND WITH THIRTY 
YEARS OF DATA TO DRAW FROM IT'S 
SEEN AS ONE OF THE BEST FORECASTING 
TOOLS ON THE MARKET 
RACHEL LOADS OF INFORMATION THERE 
BUT WE WANT MORE BECAUSE WHAT I 
WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE A FIRST 
TIME BUYER OR IF YOU'RE SWITCHING 
AROUND AT THE MOMENT SHOULD YOU BE 
LOOKING AT THESE INDICIES ARE THEY 
VERY IMPORTANT 
THEY ARE IMPORTANT 
IF YOU SPEND ALL YOUR TIME LOOKING 
AT THESE INDICIES YOU MIGHT NOT 
HAVE TIME TO LOOK FOR A PROPERTY 
WE HAVE THE THREE WE MENTIONED 
THERE YOU'RE GETTING MONTHLY 
FIGURES FROM NATIONWIDE WE HAVE THE 
DEPARTMENT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND 
RIGHT MOVE THEY ALL GIVE SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT INFORMATION BECAUSE 
THEY'RE ALL BASED ON SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT THINGS SOME PUT THEIR 
FIGURES ON THE MORTGAGE APPROVALS 
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE PRICE 
THE PROPERTY FINALLY SELLS FOR 
SOME USE HUGE SAMPLE SIZES SOME 
ARE JUST TAKING TEN THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
PROPERTIES AND LOOKING AT THAT 
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PICK ONE 
OF THESE INDICIES AND SAY THAT IT'S 
THE GOLDEN INDEX TO TELL US EXACTLY 
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE HOUSING 
MARKET THAT'S WHAT YOLANDE BARNES 
FROM THE ESTATE AGENT SAVILLS WAS 
TELLING ME 
WHAT THE INDICIES 
REVEAL ARE THE GENERAL MARKET 
CONDITIONS IN WHICH YOU'RE SELLING 
CLEARLY WE MOVED FROM A SELLERS' 
MARKET LAST YEAR TO A LOW TURNOVER 
BUYERS' MARKET THIS YEAR 
I THINK THE INDICIES ARE HELPFUL IN 
THAT RESPECT BUT PROBABLY WE 
SHOULDN'T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO 
WHETHER THE MONTHLY INDICIES 
ESPECIALLY ARE GOING UP AND DOWN 
THEY DO TEND TO JUMP AROUND A LOT 
NO INDEX IS EVER GOING TO REFLECT 
THE HOUSE THAT YOU ARE SELLING ON ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE EVEN MORE 
FIGURES IMPORTANT FIGURES THOUGH 
THEY ARE WE HAVE FIGURES FROM AN 
ORGANISATION CALLED MORTGAGE 
MONITOR THEY SAY THIS TIME A YEAR 
AGO THERE WERE SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND MORTGAGE 
DEALS AVAILABLE TO US TODAY IT'S 
DROPPED BY SEVENTY SIX PER CENT TO SIXTEEN THOUSAND 
REGARDLESS OF WHICH INDICIES YOU 
PREFER TO LOOK AT THAT SHRINKING 
OF THE MARKET IS NOT GOOD NEWS FOR 
EITHER FIRST TIME BUYERS OR PEOPLE 
LOOKING TO REMORTGAGE THEIR 
PROPERTY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH PROPERTY LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE REST OF 
THE BUSINESS NEWS 
NEARLY HALF OF US ARE CHANGING OUR 
SPENDING HABITS TO COPE WITH 
SOARING PRICES AND THE IMPACT OF 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH AROUND FORTY FOUR PER CENT OF 
PEOPLE ARE SHOPPING AROUND FOR 
BETTER DEALS AND REINING IN THEIR 
SPENDING TWO IN FIVE SAY THEY'VE 
GIVEN UP LUXURIES AND JUST OVER A 
THIRD HAVE GIVEN UP JEWELLERY SPA 
TREATMENTS AND HOLIDAYS 
CONFIRMATION THAT BUSINESS 
CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN HIT BY THE 
CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE COMES FROM 
A SURVEY OF ALMOST ONE THOUSAND CHARTERED 
ACCOUNTANTS THE ROYAL INSTITUTION 
OF CHARTERED SURVEYORS SAID THEIR 
STUDY SHOWED CONFIDENCE HAD FALLEN 
FOR A FOURTH QUARTER IN A ROW UNTIL 
THE END OF APRIL AND THAT HAD 
SPREAD TO ALL SECTORS OF BUSINESS 
JEAN CLAUDE TRICHET THE 
INFLUENTIAL HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN 
CENTRAL BANK SAYS HE'S NOT SURE 
WE'RE OVER THE WORST OF THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH IN A B. B. C. INTERVIEW HE SAID 
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF ONGOING VERY 
SIGNIFICANT MARKET CORRECTION HE 
ADDED THAT THE RECENT RISE IN OIL 
AND FOOD PRICES WAS SIMILAR TO THE 
OIL SHOCK OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
SUMER IS ALMOST UPON US FINGERS 
CROSSED AND THE HOLIDAY SEASON IS 
ABOUT TO BEGIN THERE IS LOTS OF 
ADVICE AROUND ABOUT TAKING YOUR 
CREDIT CARD ABROAD WE THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE WORTH SPENDING A FEW 
MINUTES TO TALK ABOUT WAYS TO 
STRETCH YOUR CASH WHEN YOU DO GO ON 
THAT HOLIDAY 
STRETCH YOUR CASH WHEN YOU DO GO ON THAT HOLIDAY 
THAT HOLIDAY LN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WE SPENT TWENTY FIVE BILLION ON 
OUR DEBIT AND CREDIT CARDS ABROAD 
THIS WAS UP TWENTY THREE BILLION THE YEAR 
BEFORE WHAT SHOULD YOU THINK ABOUT 
WHEN CHOOSING A CARD 
FIRST OF ALL THERE'S THE LOADING 
FEE WHICH BANKS CAN ADD IF YOU USE 
YOUR CARD WHILE YOU'RE AWAY IT CAN 
BE UP TO THREE PER CENT OF YOUR SPEND AND 
APPLIES TO BOTH CREDIT AND DEBIT 
CARDS THEN THERE ARE CHARGES TO 
WITH DRAWING CASH THESE CAN APPLY 
AGAIN TO DEBIT AND CREDIT CARDS 
THERE MAY ALSO BE A TRANSACTION 
CHARGE THIS ONLY APPLIES TO DEBIT 
CARDS AND CAN BE INCURRED EVERY 
TIME YOU USE YOUR CARD TO BUY 
SOMETHING SOMETHING LOTS OF INFORMATION THERE TO HELP 
US MAKE SOME SENSE OF IT IS GEMMA 
SPACE FROM MY PACKS THE TRADE 
ASSOCIATION FOR PAYMENT AND 
CLEARING 
CLEARING LOTS OF DIFFERENT CHARGES 
AND INFORMATION THERE A FAIRLY 
OBVIOUS QUESTION CAN WE NOT DO 
SOMETHING WE'VE DONE IT WITH RAIL 
PRICES AND TICKETS CAN WE NOT GET 
IT SIMPLIFIED 
ALL THE INFORMATION 
IS THERE ON CREDIT CARDS YOU'LL 
FIND INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN 
TRANSACTIONS ON YOUR SUMMARY BOX 
ON DEBIT CARDS YOU'LL FIND IT IN 
YOUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHAT I 
CAN SAY IS THAT IT CLEARLY PAYS TO 
SHOP AROUND BEFORE YOU GO ON 
HOLIDAY 
HOW MUCH SHOPPING AROUND HOLIDAY CAN YOU DO PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THEY 
HAVE THEIR CREDIT CARD AND DEBIT 
CARD IT'S A LOT OF MESSING AROUND 
TO HAVE TO CHANGE THOSE DO WE HAVE 
TO CHANGE THEM OR CAN YOU SHOP 
WITHIN THOSE CREDIT CARD 
AGREEMENTS 
IT DEPENDS ON YOU AS AN AGREEMENTS INDIVIDUAL HOW OFTEN DO YOU GO AWAY 
AND TO LOOK BACK ON PREVIOUS 
STATEMENTS AND SEE HOW MUCH YOUR 
TRANSACTIONS HAVE CHARGED YOU 
BY AND LARGE THERE IS A CARD OUT 
THERE THAT WILL SUIT THE WAY YOU 
WANT TO USE IT AND IT DOES MAKE 
SENSE TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF 
HOMEWORK BEFORE YOU GO AWAY WHAT ARE THE 
TOP TIPS 
WHEN YOU ARE 
A BROAD 
IN TERMS OF A CASH MACHINE IT IS 
USEFUL TO USE THE SAME BRANCH AS 
YOUR BANK AT HOME IT IS ALWAYS 
IMPORTANT TO READ THE ON SCREEN 
INFORMATION THERE MAY BE AN 
ADDITIONAL CHARGE WHERE CREDIT 
CARDS ARE CONCERNED YOU'RE LIKELY 
TO BE CHARGED A CASH ADVANCE FEE 
AND GET INTEREST ACCRUED FROM THE 
DAY YOU TAKE OUT THAT MONEY AT 
PERICARD IS POSSIBLY THE BEST 
OPTION AT CREDIT CARD IS LIKELY TO 
BE YOUR BEST OPTION IN A SHOP 
BECAUSE YOU GET SECTION SEVENTY FIVE COVER 
SECONDLY YOU HAVE THE FRAUD 
PROTECTION PROTECTION SECTION SEVENTY FIVE IS WHAT 
BE IS OVER ONE HUNDRED AND UNDER THIRTY 
THEY THIS TALK ABOUT PRE PAID CARDS 
LET US TALK ABOUT PRE PAID CARDS 
QUITE A LOT OF DIFFERENT BATH MAT 
DIFFERENCES THERE 
THEY ARE AN EAST PRODUCT WE'RE 
JUST SEEN THEM INTRODUCED INTO THE 
U. K. AND NICHE PRODUCT THEY COME 
WITH THEIR OWN CHARGES YOU NEED TO 
LOOK AT THE CHARGES JUST AS YOU 
WOULD WITH A CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD 
THEY MAY BE BEST SUITED TO SOMEONE 
WHO DOES NOT HAVE A CREDIT OR DEBIT 
CARD OR SOMEONE ON A BUDGET IT IS 
FINE IN THE CARD SUITED TO YOUR 
NEEDS NEEDS FINALLY WHAT ABOUT STERLING THERE 
ARE SOME PITFALLS IN TERMS OF HIGH 
YOU DID THAT TRANSACTION HOW YOU 
DO THE TRANSACTION 
AGAIN IT IS MAKING YOUR CHOICE AS 
THE CONSUMER THIS IS ABOUT THE 
RETAILER HAVING THE OPTION OF 
GIVING YOU THE CUSTOMER THE JOYS 
OF HAVING THE TRANSACTION IN THE 
LOCAL CURRENCY WARREN STERLING 
THE CHOICE OR IN STERLING BY 
AND LARGE WILL PROBABLY FIND IT IS 
WORTH GOING FOR THE LOCAL CURRENCY 
OPTION BECAUSE THEY KNEW ANOTHER 
RATE YOU'RE GETTING IS THE ONE THE 
BANK IS GIVING YOU 
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GIVE YOU A BIT 
MORE USEFUL INFORMATION HERE AT 
THE BEST CADET CREDIT AND DEBIT 
CARDS ON THE MARKET AT THE MOMENT 
EACH OF THOSE CHARGED THREE OR TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
PER A. T. M. WITHDRAWALS FOR DEBIT 
CARDS

DECADES THE OVER SEVENTIES WILL MAKE UP 
ONE QUARTER OF THE U. K. POPULATION

LATER IN THE WEEK WE WILL BE 
LOOKING AT LIFE EXPECTANCY 
IF HE DID NOT KNOW ALREADY THE 
WEBSITE IS A REALLY GOOD PLACE TO 
GO IF YOU FANCY WATCHING SOMETHING 
AGAIN 
JUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IT IS 
EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNMENT 
IS POISED TO BECOME THE FIRST IN 
THE WEST TO ISSUE SO CALLED ISLAMIC 
BOMBS WHAT ARE THEY AND SHOULD HE 
BE INVESTING WARNS 
UNDER THE RULES OF ISLAMIC FINANCE 
THE INTEREST PAYMENTS IS 
EFFECTIVELY FORBIDDEN AND THERE IS 
CONSIDERED A PARTNER IN BUSINESS 
THE PRINCIPLE BEHIND THIS MEANS 
THAT YOU CANNOT EITHER RECEIVE A 
PAY INTEREST BECAUSE ISLAM DEFINES 
INTEREST AS A FORMER OF USURY WHICH 
HE IS NOT ACTUALLY ALLOWED A 
FORM OF USURY A COMMON SELECTION 
IS TO USE AT LEAST HERE THE MONEY 
FROM INVESTORS IS USED TO BUY AN 
ASSET WHICH MUST ACCORD WITH 
ISLAMIC OR SHARIA LAW ONCE THE 
ACID IS PURCHASED IT CAN BE PAID 
TO INVESTORS WHEN IT FINISHES THE 
UNDERLYING ASSETS IS SOLD ALLOWING 
INVESTORS TO GET BACK THEIR 
ORIGINAL INVESTMENT ISLAMIC LOANS 
ARE OFTEN STRUCTURED AS PROFIT 
SHARING BENCHER THE PRINCIPLE 
BEHIND ALL THIS IS THAT THERE IS 
SHARING OF RISK THIS HOW AN 
ISLAMIC BOND MIGHT WORK IN THIS 
WAY SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BUY A 
BOND GIVES MONEY TO AN ORGANISATION 
WHICH BUYS LET'S SAY BUILDING 
FOR INSTANCE THE BUILDING 
GENERATES 
IS THEN 
PAID TO THE INVESTOR INSTEAD OF 
INTEREST NO INTEREST IS PAID AT 
THE END OF THE BOND WHEN THAT BOND 
MATURES THE PROPERTY WILL HAVE TO 
BE SOLD TO GIVE THE ORIGINAL MONEY 
BACK TO THE INVESTOR THAT IS HOW 
BOND MIGHT ACTUALLY WORK IN THAT 
WAY THEY HAVE A BOY DID THE WHOLE 
CONCEPT OF INTEREST WHAT THEY HAVE 
DONE IS GENERATED A REGULAR STREAM 
OF MONEY JUST LIKE INTEREST BUT 
IT IS BASED ON SHARING THE RISK IN 
THE MAXWELL BUSINESS VENTURE OF 
BASLE BONDS ARE HITTING THE NEWS 
TODAY THERE ARE ALREADY LOTS OF 
ISLAMIC BASED IN INVESTMENTS IT 
LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BECOME A GROWING 
AREA OF THE MARKET THE GOVERNMENT 
OF THE U. K. IS KEEN TO MAKE COST 
LEADING CENTRE FOR ISLAMIC FINANCE 
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SHARES 
YOU ARE A GREAT CHANCE ON 
FRIDAY WE ARE LOOKING AT SHARES 
ALSO AND IN SOME OF THOSE PRE PAID 
CARDS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WE 
WILL BE DOING REPORT ON THAT IN 
THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE THAT
