THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE 
SIX YOUNG ATHLETES HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE OF A LIFETIME 
TO TRAVEL THE WORLD AND COMPETE AGAINST THE MOST REMOTE TRIBES ON EARTH ON THEIR OWN TURF 
I AM REALLY BRICKING IT 
OH 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE'RE GOING 
ALL SIX MEN ARE MASTERS IN THEIR CHOSEN FIELDS 
COVERING THE HEAVY LIFTING BRAD BRINGS THE BRAWN 
I'M A STRONG MAN EVERY COMPETITION YOU ARE YOUR ONE MAN ARMY 
OXFORD GRADUATE RICHARD IS ENGLISH GRIT 
I LOVE TO WIN I HATE LOSING 
JASON IS A CHAMPION B. M. X. SPRINTER WHO HAS FOUGHT HIS WAY TO THE TOP 
YOU KNOW THEY'VE GOT THE OLD PHRASE IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM JOIN 'EM 
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT 
IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM YOU CHEAT 
MARK IS ALL TECHNIQUE A SALSA DANCER WITH A PUNCH 
I'M PRETTY GOOD AT EVERYTHING THAT I DO 
COREY IS A HARVARD EDUCATED SCIENTIST 
I USE MY BRAIN BEFORE MY MUSCLE 
AND A TOP ENDURANCE ATHLETE 
RAJKO IS A FITNESS GURU WITH A BODY HONED TO PERFECTION 
I WANT TO ACHIEVE MY OPTIMUM AS A PHYSICAL BEING 
OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS ALL SIX WILL BE PUT THROUGH HELL 
BUT WILL THEIR WESTERN SKILLS COUNT FOR ANYTHING 
I CAN'T BREATHE AS THEY'RE HURLED INTO A WORLD OF TRIBAL SPORT AND RITUAL 
UNLIKE ANYTHING THEY'VE EVER SEEN 
YEAH 
COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BE THE LAST MAN STANDING 
OUR ATHLETES ARE HEADING DEEP INTO THE BRAZILIAN RAINFOREST 
IT'S THE START OF A YEAR LONG JOURNEY THAT'LL TAKE THEM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
RIGHT NOW THEY HAVEN'T A CLUE WHAT LIES IN STORE 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I'M GOING 
AND I MAY BE WILDLY UNPREPARED 
WHEN I THINK ABOUT FIGHTING IN COMBAT 
I DON'T GET TOO NERVOUS 
I GOT HIT IN MY RIBS BAM BAM 
I'M SCARED YOU KNOW 
OH 
I'M GOING WELL OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE 
I'LL HAVE NO TROUBLE CONNECTING WITH THE PEOPLE 
COME ON WHAT IS THIS ABOUT 
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE WHEREVER THEY ARE IN THE WORLD 
I FEEL LIKE I CAN COPE WITH ANYTHING 
AH 
I EXPECT IT TO BE HARD 
I'M READY TO GO TO WAR 
THIS IS OUR ATHLETES' VERY FIRST CHALLENGE 
THEY KNOW THEY'RE IN BRAZIL WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW 
IS THEY'RE ABOUT TO MEET ONE OF THE MOST UNTOUCHED TRIBES IN THE WORLD 
THE KALAPALO 
FOR THE NEXT TEN DAYS THEY'LL BE IN PARADISE 
EXCEPT FOR ONE TINY THING 
THEY JUST WANT TO KICK OUR ASS 
IN ORDER TO STAY 
I FEEL LIKE A WUSS 
THIS IS BRUTAL 
THEY'LL ENDURE BLISTERING AGONY 
I'M REALLY IN QUITE SERIOUS PAIN WOW 
BECAUSE IN TEN DAYS' TIME 
EAT OR BE EATEN FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES 
YEAH IT'S GETTING DIRTY IT'S GETTING DIRTY AS IT GETS BABY 
THE KALAPALO ARE ONE OF THE MOST ISOLATED OF ALL BRAZIL'S INDIGENOUS TRIBES 
TODAY THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE OF HUNDRED OF THEM LEFT 
LIVING A WAY OF LIFE THAT'S BARELY CHANGED FOR CENTURIES 
YEAH CHAMPION 
LOTS OF PUNCHING GOING ON 
UH OH HE'S TWISTING 
AFTER SOME LIGHT PRODDING THE ATHLETES ARE LED INTO THE KALAPALO VILLAGE 
ALL OF A SUDDEN THE PATH JUST OPENS UP TO THESE HUGE STRAW HUTS 
IT'S PRETTY UNREAL ISN'T IT 
IT'S AMAZING 
DIRT FLOOR NAKED WOMEN 
THIS IS AS PRIMITIVE AS IT GETS 
YOU KNOW THIS IS TRULY STEPPING BACK IN TIME 
SO WE GO TO THE PLACE WHERE ONLY MEN ARE ALLOWED 
AND WE MEET THE HEAD CHIEF 
TO PROVE THEMSELVES 
THE ATHLETES MUST MASTER A SPORT NO WESTERNER HAS EVER BEEN ALLOWED TO ATTEMPT 
KALAPALO WRESTLING 
THE SPORT IS A TRIBAL REPLACEMENT FOR WAR 
COMMON INJURIES INCLUDE DISLOCATED ARMS AND BROKEN NECKS 
AND IN JUST TEN DAYS OUR ATHLETES MUST COMPETE IN THE BIGGEST CONTEST OF THE YEAR 
I WAS PROBABLY MORE CONCERNED THAN ANYONE ELSE REALLY 
ABOUT THE DANGER OF THE SPORT THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE PART IN 
ESPECIALLY WITH THE COMBAT BACKGROUND I'VE GOT 
I UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY TO HAVE EXPERIENCE IN BEING ABLE TO DEFEND YOURSELF 
AND NONE OF US HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE 
THE ATHLETES WILL BE LIVING WITH THE LOCALS 
FITNESS EXPERT RAJKO AND STRONGMAN BRAD ARE MOVING IN WITH WRESTLING COACH ALZUKI 
RAJKO RAJKO 
IT'S CRAZY I'VE ACTUALLY JUST SEEN A REALLY GOOD LOOKING YOUNG GIRL AS WELL 
EYE ON THE PRIZE 
IT'S AMAZING 
BUT I'M A LITTLE BIT ANXIOUS ABOUT THE FIGHTING 
VIOLENCE IS DEFINITELY A LAST RESORT 
I'VE NEVER REALLY HAD TO USE IT 
RAJKO IS A FITNESS GURU 
AT TWENTY NINE HE'S THE OLDEST OF THE SIX 
THE DUMBBELLS ARE TWENTY KILOS 
HIS STRENGTH EARNED HIM A WORLD RECORD 
THE RECORD I SET WAS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY CONSECUTIVE LIFTS 
HE'S A TEACHER 
TAKE A DEEP BREATH 
A THINKER I THINK MY MIND IS STRONGER THAN MY BODY 
AND A BELIEVER 
I AM CHRISTIAN THAT'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH 
I THINK IT JUST ADDS A DIMENSION 
AND A MEANING TO LIFE THAT OTHERWISE ISN'T THERE 
BUT HE'S ALSO A TOUGH COMPETITOR 
MY TRAINING IS ALL ABOUT HIGH INTENSITY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME 
SO I'M USED TO PUSHING MYSELF HARD 
HAVING A STRONG MIND AND A STRONG BODY IS ONE THING 
BUT I ALSO WANT A STRONG SPIRITUAL LIFE 
SO THAT'S SOMETHING I'M GOING TO SEARCH FOR IN THESE TRIBES AS WELL 
THREE HUNDRED MILES FROM THE NEAREST TOWN 
THE ATHLETES SETTLE DOWN FOR THEIR FIRST NIGHT 
THESE GUYS ARE REALLY LOOKING AFTER US REALLY LOOKING AFTER US 
AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL 
THIS IS TAMALUI 
REALLY GOOD HOST AND YOU KNOW HE'S REALLY MADE THIS PLACE FEEL LIKE HOME 
I THINK WE'RE BONDING WITH THEM QUITE WELL 
AS MUCH AS WE CAN DO SO FAR 
IN NINE DAYS 
RIVAL TRIBES WILL SEND THEIR BEST FIGHTERS TO TAKE ON THE LOCALS IN A BRUTAL WRESTLING CONTEST 
THIS YEAR THE KALAPALO HAVE AGREED TO LET OUR ATHLETES TRY OUT FOR THEIR TEAM 
IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE TO HAVE ANY CHANCE AT TAKING PART OUR BOYS WILL HAVE TO LEARN FAST 
THAT'S WHY CHAMPION WRESTLER ALZUKI HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AS COACH 
SO TO WIN YOU EITHER GRAB YOUR OPPONENT'S LEG 
SPIN AROUND BEHIND HIM 
OR PIN HIM ON HIS BACK 
IF THE WRESTLERS BREAK APART IT'S A DRAW 
I GUESS IT'S TIME TO WRESTLE BOYS 
RAJKO IS FIRST TO HAVE A GO 
APPARENTLY THE NOISES ARE SUPPOSED TO MIMIC 
THE AGGRESSIVE SOUND OF THE JAGUAR 
RAJKO LOSES 
NEXT IN IS B. M. X. CHAMPION JASON 
A MAN WHO IS MORE USED TO STREET FIGHTING THAN TRIBAL WRESTLING 
AT TWENTY TREE SURGEON JASON IS THE YOUNGEST OF THE SIX 
MY DAD TAUGHT ME ALWAYS PHYSICAL IS LIKE LAST RESORT 
BUT I MEAN I AIN'T GOT NO PROBLEM GETTING PHYSICAL THAT'S FOR SURE 
WHEN HE'S NOT UP A TREE HE'S ON A BIKE 
GROWING UP I DEFINITELY WASN'T A HOODLUM 
BUT WE JUST HAPPENED TO GET INTO FIGHTS A LOT YOU KNOW 
I CAN'T REALLY EVER REMEMBER BEING OUT WITH MY PARENTS AND EVERYONE GETTING ALONG 
B. M. X. WAS ALWAYS MY WAY OF ESCAPE 
HE LIVES IN FLORIDA WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND EMILY 
SHE'S MY HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART 
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF YEARS MAYBE 
I THINK WE'RE JUST TWO PEAS IN A POD 
JASON WANTS THIS CONTEST TO TURN HIM INTO A MAN 
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DO I REALLY WANT TO DO IN LIFE 
I WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD SEE DIFFERENT CULTURES 
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT BUT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT 
I WANT TO FEEL IT SMELL IT 
THE WRESTLERS BREAK APART AND JASON GETS A DRAW 
MARK IS HOPING HIS MARTIAL ARTS BACKGROUND WILL GIVE HIM AN EDGE 
GET HIM UP MARK GET HIM UP 
IT DOESN'T 
AND THINGS AREN'T ANY BETTER FOR RICHARD 
OR COREY 
FINALLY THE MAN MOUNTAIN THE KALAPALO HAVE THEIR EYES ON 
BIG BAD BRAD 
WEIGHING IN AT TWO HUNDRED FORTY L. B. S. 
BRAD IS ONE OF AMERICA'S TOP STRONGMEN 
I HATE TO LOSE 
I FEEL ILL I WANT TO THROW UP I WANT TO HURL 
THIS TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD OKLAHOMA BOY LIKES HIS FOOD 
I EAT OFTEN AND I EAT A LOT 
BRAD IS THE ONLY MARRIED ATHLETE AND HE'S A FATHER 
SINCE MY LITTLE ONE HAS BEEN BORN 
I'VE DEFINITELY BECOME A DIFFERENT PERSON 
YEAH HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
HE'S LEFT AMERICA FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME SIMPLY TO MAKE HIS FAMILY PROUD 
YEAH I LIKE TO BE A SUPERHERO 
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO BE WHEN I GROW UP OH YEAH HE'S MY ACTION HERO 
BRAD MAY BE A HERO AT HOME BUT NOT TO THIS BLOKE 
HIS DEFEAT MEANS FIVE OF THE SIX ATHLETES HAVE LOST 
ONLY JASON MANAGED A DRAW 
NOT EXACTLY A GOOD START 
THE ATHLETES HAVEN'T JUST GOT SOME SERIOUS TRAINING TO THINK ABOUT 
THE WRESTLING COMPETITION IS ALSO THE CLIMAX OF A SACRED RITUAL 
WHICH COMMITS THE SPIRITS OF THE DECEASED TO THE AFTERLIFE 
IT'S CALLED RATHER WORRYINGLY THE FESTIVAL OF DEATH 
IT ALL BEGINS WITH A JOURNEY DEEP INTO THE FOREST 
AND OUR ATHLETES HAVE BEEN TAKEN ALONG TO HELP OUT 
THE TRIBE NEEDS A TREE 
THAT CAN CHANNEL THE SOULS OF THEIR LOVED ONES INTO THE AFTERLIFE 
THEY CALL IT A SPIRIT TREE 
I JUDGE THESE THINGS EVERY DAY 
AND THE WEIGHT ON EACH SIDE OF THE TREE IS PRETTY EQUAL 
SO IT JUST DEPENDS HOW YOU CUT IT 
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE FUNKIEST LOOKING CUTS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE 
THE TRIBE NOW HAS ITS SPIRIT TREE 
IS THAT HOW IT GOES 
SO FAR THE ATHLETES HAVE DONE LITTLE MORE THAN LIGHT WHOOPING 
BUT THERE'S A SURPRISE FOR BRAD 
APPARENTLY THIS IS A TEST OF STRENGTH 
FOR SOME REASON THEY THINK I CAN PICK THIS UP AND JUST THROW IT OVER THERE 
GUESS I'M HERCULES 
THE TREE WEIGHS OVER THREE HUNDRED KILOS 
THE EQUIVALENT OF FOUR FULLY GROWN MEN 
SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF THEIR SCOPE OF WHAT THEY NORMALLY CAN DO STRENGTHWISE 
THEY JUST WANT TO SEE LET'S GET THE BIGGEST ONE AND SEE IF HE CAN DO IT 
COS IF HE HAS SUPERHERO STRENGTH WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT NOW YEAH 
HAVING IMPRESSED THE AUDIENCE BRAD IS SUMMONED BY THE TRIBE'S SHAMAN 
ESSENTIALLY HE TOLD ME THAT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE 
I GUESS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE MESSAGE IS THAT I SHOULD FIGHT AND THAT HE BELIEVES THAT I WILL WIN 
AND COMING FROM A SHAMAN THAT'S VERY DEEP AND VERY IMPORTANT 
YOU KNOW WHAT DID HE SAY THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE MAN 
AFTER THREE DAYS OF TRAINING THE CHIEF WANTS TO KNOW 
IF ANY OF OUR ATHLETES WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE KALAPALO TEAM 
USING HIS BEST FIGHTERS TO TEST THEM OUR ATHLETES BEGIN TO TAKE A BIT OF A PASTING 
AW DAMN IT 
AFTER HIS EARLY PROMISE EVEN JASON STRUGGLES 
MAYBE THEY JUST WANT TO KICK OUR ASS 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO 
AND COREY GETS AN UNCOMFORTABLE WAKE UP CALL 
IT JUST SEEMS UNNECESSARY 
MY SHOULDER TOOK THE BRUNT OF THE BLOW 
I COULD HAVE BEEN PARALYSED NECK INJURY BACK INJURY 
THAT WAS DANGEROUS 
RICHARD GIVES IT HIS ALL 
BUT AS THE LIGHTWEIGHT OF THE GROUP THE ODDS ARE STACKED AGAINST HIM 
TWENTY YEAR OLD RICHARD CUT HIS TEETH ON THE PLAYING FIELDS OF OXFORD 
I LOVE TO WIN I HATE LOSING IN AN ALMOST CHILDISH WAY 
I JUST REALLY REALLY LOVE TO WIN 
AND ON THE CROQUET LAWN 
I'M GOING TO BE WAY OUTSIDE MY COMFORT ZONE AS IT WERE 
I'M GOING TO BE FACED WITH A LOT OF VERY HIGH PRESSURE SITUATIONS 
RICHARD HAS A DEGREE IN THEOLOGY AND A LITTLE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY 
THIS IS WHERE I LIVE 
I'VE LIVED MY LIFE IN A VERY SECURE WORLD 
BUT I'M VERY VERY KEEN TO SHOW FROM THE OUTSET THAT 
YOU KNOW I'M SOMEONE WHO CAN ROUGH IT WITH THE BEST OF THEM 
I CAN GIVE AS GOOD AS I GET 
I GIVE EVERYTHING MY BEST SHOT 
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TAUGHT MAYBE THAT'S THE ENGLISH WAY 
DESPITE HIS ADMIRABLY STIFF UPPER LIP RICHARD COMES TO A STICKY END 
AFTER I WAS DUMPED ON MY ARSE I SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AND THEY ALL PISSED THEMSELVES 
THEY'D NEVER HEARD ANYTHING SO SILLY THAT SOMEONE WOULD SAY THANK YOU 
MARK IS IN NEXT AND DESPERATE TO IMPROVE ON YESTERDAY'S LUKEWARM START 
A TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD BRUMMIE MARK IS THE ALL ROUNDER IN THE GROUP 
IF THE OTHER LADS PERCEIVE ME AS AN UNDERDOG BRING IT ON I'M FULL OF SURPRISES 
HE HAS A PASSION FOR SALSA DANCING 
PEOPLE THINK I'M A LITTLE BIT OF A WOMANISER BUT NOT IN A BAD WAY 
I'M VERY POLITE I TREAT PEOPLE THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE TREATED 
BUT HE'S ALSO A TRAINED MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT 
IN ONE ON ONE COMBAT I THINK I'LL BE THE FAVOURITE 
BECAUSE OF THE KICKBOXING SPEED CONTROLLED AGGRESSION WITH THE SALSA FOOTWORK AND BALANCE 
BUT FOR MARK THIS TRIP IS MORE THAN JUST AN ADVENTURE 
I'M DOING THIS JOURNEY MOSTLY FOR MY DAD I FEEL I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO PROVE 
MARK'S FATHER DIED NINE YEARS AGO 
WHEN MY DAD WAS AROUND I WAS AN UNDERACHIEVER 
AND I SUPPOSE I NEVER GOT TO HEAR THOSE WORDS THAT HE WAS PROUD OF ME 
WHICH IS SORT OF WHERE MY MOTIVATION COMES FROM YOU KNOW 
I THINK THE MORE THAT I ACHIEVE FROM NOW ON 
DEEP DOWN I KNOW HE'S PROUD OF ME 
MARK GIVES IT EVERYTHING 
BUT HIS COMBAT AND DANCING SKILLS AREN'T ENOUGH 
I FEEL LIKE A WUSS 
IT'S LEFT TO BRAD THE SHAMAN'S CHOSEN ONE TO SALVAGE OUR ATHLETES' FORTUNES 
BUT JUST LIKE THE OTHERS HE GETS DUMPED 
I'M EXHAUSTED 
THIS IS BRUTAL 
THE CHIEF HAS BEEN WATCHING AND HE'S NOT HAPPY 
IT'S A DISASTER 
NOT ONE OF THE SIX IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE KALAPALO TEAM 
WHEN THE CHIEF SUGGESTED HE WAS GOING TO WRITE US OFF 
AND NOT EVEN ALLOW US A CHANCE IN THE COMPETITION 
IT ENRAGED ME I WAS FURIOUS 
ON ONE HAND HE WAS SAYING YOU HAVE TO TRAIN FOR EIGHT YEARS TO BE GOOD AT THIS WRESTLING 
AND THEN THE NEXT SENTENCE HE'S SAYING YOU KNOW YOU HAVEN'T IMPROVED IN TWO HOURS OF TRAINING 
YOU KNOW YOU REALLY DISAPPOINTED ME I HATE TO BE WRITTEN OFF 
I DON'T MIND BEING BAD AT SOMETHING I'M HOPELESS AT SO MANY THINGS 
BUT FOR SOMEONE JUST TO CALL ME HOPELESS WITHOUT THAT I'M HOPELESS REALLY GETS MY GOAT 
THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE ATHLETES DECIDE TO FIGHT BACK 
WE'VE ALL BEEN SPEAKING TO OUR HOSTS 
AND PEOPLE AROUND THE VILLAGE JUST SAYING WE REALLY DO WANT TO FIGHT 
AND WHO KNOWS WITH A BIT OF LUCK THEY MIGHT GO AND BE ABLE TO PERSUADE THE CHIEF IN OUR FAVOUR 
AND THE LOCALS SEEM TO BE ON THEIR SIDE 
WHILE THE CHIEF DELIBERATES THE SHAMAN IS CALLED TO SEE BRAD 
EVEN IF THE ATHLETES ARE PERMITTED TO FIGHT AGAIN HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO 
I'VE GOT SOME KIND OF INFECTION GOING ON IN MY THROAT 
SOMEHOW A BAD SPIRIT IN THE WOODS EMBEDDED ITSELF IN ME 
AND IT'S THE SHAMAN'S JOB TO FIND WHAT SPIRIT IT IS 
AND WHERE IT IS AND TO BE ABLE TO PULL IT OUT OF YOU 
HAVING A MALE NOT ONLY A MALE BUT A NAKED MALE 
RUBBING ME AND BLOWING AND SUCKING ON MY STOMACH 
IS SOMETHING I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED AND I DON'T WANT TO EXPERIENCE IT AGAIN 
BUT WHILE BRAD IS STILL WIPING SHAMAN SPIT OFF HIS STOMACH 
THERE'S GOOD NEWS 
THE CHIEF HAS DECIDED TO GIVE ALL THE ATHLETES ONE LAST CHANCE 
I'M THRILLED THAT FINALLY WE'RE BEING CONSIDERED 
I'M GOING TO TRY AND SEIZE IT WITH BOTH HANDS 
TOMORROW MORNING THE ATHLETES WILL BE ALLOWED ONE FINAL TRAINING SESSION 
IF THEY FAIL THEY'LL BE SENT AWAY IN DISGRACE 
IF THEY SUCCEED THEY'LL BECOME ONE OF THE TRIBE 
THE FIRST WESTERNERS EVER TO BECOME KALAPALO WARRIORS 
IT'S JUDGMENT DAY 
THERE'S STILL NO GUARANTEE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THIS TOURNAMENT 
NO WESTERNERS HAVE EVER COMPETED IN THIS TOURNAMENT AND THEY HAVEN'T GIVEN US APPROVAL TO COMPETE 
EVEN DESPITE MY AWARENESS THAT THERE'S SUCH A TINY CHANCE 
I'M GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH AND BECOME A WARRIOR 
IT WON'T BE EASY 
AND THERE'S A FRESH TWIST 
TO PROVE THEMSELVES WORTHY THE CHIEF HAS DECIDED TO MAKE OUR ATHLETES FIGHT EACH OTHER 
FIRST UP MOUNTAINEER COREY AGAINST A NEWLY REVITALISED BRAD 
THE PRESSURE IS ON YOU KNOW 
WHENEVER YOU'RE IN THE ARENA AND IT'S GAME TIME 
YOU DON'T SEE THAT PERSON AS YOUR FRIEND 
YOU SEE THAT PERSON AS YOUR ENEMY 
COREY KNOWS AS WELL AS I DO ONCE IT'S TIME TO GO WE GO 
BRAD WINS 
OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS THE ATHLETES TAKE TURNS TO FIGHT EACH OTHER 
FINALLY JASON THE ONLY ATHLETE TO IMPRESS IN EARLY TRAINING TAKES ON FITNESS GURU RAJKO 
WHOO 
JASON LOSES AND RAJKO IS BUILDING A FAN BASE 
I'M PROBABLY LETTING DOWN THE WHOLE B. M. X. WORLD DOWN RIGHT NOW 
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL WANTING ME TO GET IN THERE AND SWING IT OUT 
WITH THE FIGHTING OVER THE CHIEF MUST DECIDE IF ANYONE IS GOOD ENOUGH TO REPRESENT THEIR TRIBE 
NO ONE EXPECTED THIS 
ONLY THREE OF THEM ARE DEEMED WORTHY TO FIGHT 
RAJKO BRAD AND AGAINST ALL ODDS LIGHTWEIGHT RICHARD 
YEAH THAT'S A TURN UP FOR THE BOOKS 
I MEAN I'M MASSIVELY SURPRISED 
I THINK EVERYONE IS A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED BUT I'M ALSO HUGELY 
I'M VERY GLAD I'M VERY KIND OF 
IT'S A HUGE COMPLIMENT TO BE INVITED 
IT MEANS THAT THREE VERY VERY GOOD FIGHTERS HAVEN'T GOT THE CHANCE 
JASON I'M SURE IS GOING TO BE GUTTED 
FOR MARK COREY AND JASON THE CONTEST IS OVER 
AND THEY'RE SENT AWAY TO REFLECT ON THEIR FAILURE 
I LET MYSELF DOWN RIGHT NOW AND 
YOU KNOW WHEN I LOOK BACK ON THIS I MIGHT MIGHT BE LIKE DAMN I SHOULD HAVE TRIED HARDER 
LOSING TODAY HAS REALLY REALLY REALLY UPSET ME 
I HATE NOT BEING ABLE TO COMPETE 
AND TODAY I WASN'T ABLE TO COMPETE 
I'M BUMMED OUT ABOUT NOT MAKING THE WRESTLING COMPETITION COS I'M NOT GOING TO GET TO EXPERIENCE 
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE COMPETITION AND THE CEREMONY AND THE HONOUR BEHIND IT 
BACK IN THE VILLAGE THE KALAPALO ARE PREPARING FOR THE IMMINENT FESTIVAL OF DEATH 
FOR SURVIVORS BRAD RAJKO AND RICHARD THERE'S NO GOING BACK 
WE'RE ALL AWARE THAT THEY'LL THROW US IF THEY CAN AND THEY'LL DUMP US IF THEY CAN 
BUT WE'LL MAKE SURE THEY DON'T 
IT WON'T BE EASY FOR THEM TO DUMP ME OR BRAD 
IT WON'T BE EASY FOR THEM TO DUMP RICH BUT EVEN HARDER TO DUMP US BECAUSE WE'RE QUITE HEAVY 
WE'RE STILL AWARE THAT THERE'S A CHANCE 
IF SOMEONE PULLED A MOVE LIKE THAT GUY DID ON COREY 
THERE'S A CHANCE I COULD GET HURT 
BUT YOU KNOW I'M QUITE 
OPTIMISTIC AT LEAST FOR A FEW ROUNDS I CAN KEEP IN ONE PIECE 
THE MAIN THING IS WE'VE GOT TO SHOW 'EM WE MEAN BUSINESS 
THAT WE CAN LEARN SOMETHING IN A FEW DAYS AND TURN IT ON 
FIGHTING TALK THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT 
THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND OUR LOSING ATHLETES 
FIND OUT WHAT THEY'LL BE DOING INSTEAD OF WRESTLING 
THE FESTIVAL WILL ATTRACT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO THE KALAPALO VILLAGE 
AND WHEN YOU HAVE GUESTS COMING OVER YOU CAN NEVER CATCH TOO MANY FISH 
APPARENTLY THIS ROOT IS POISONOUS TO THE FISH AND MAKES THEM DRUNK 
SO WE'RE SMACKING THE ROOTS TO TRY TO RELEASE THE POISON INSIDE 
IN THE WATER IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT PLACES 
WE'VE GOT A NET SET UP DOWN THERE 
AND ONCE WE RELEASE THAT POISON THE FISH WILL START ACTING DRUNK 
AND IF YOU'VE EVER WONDERED WHAT FISH DO WHEN THEY'RE DRUNK THEY DO THIS 
THE DRUNK FISH HELP TO TAKE OUR ATHLETES' MINDS OFF THE PAIN OF DEFEAT 
I GREW UP FISHING I GREW UP ON THE WATER 
AND I'VE SAT AT HOME AND WATCHED THE T. V. AND THEN LIKE 
MAN FISHING IN THE AMAZON MAY NOT BE SO AWESOME 
BUT I'LL NEVER GET A CHANCE TO DO THAT 
LOOK AT ME NOW MAN 
THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS I'VE DONE IN A LONG LONG TIME 
IF NOT THE COOLEST THING 
GOD HAS DEFINITELY BEEN WATCHING OVER ME MAN SO I FEEL GOOD 
BACK IN THE VILLAGE THE THREE SURVIVORS ARE ABOUT TO DISCOVER 
THAT BEFORE THEY CAN BECOME KALAPALO WARRIORS 
ONE MORE TEST AWAITS THEM 
IT'S QUITE AN INTIMIDATING SCENE THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF STRANGE NOISES THE MARACAS 
AND THE GENERAL ATMOSPHERE EVERYONE IS QUITE EXCITED TO SEE US DO THIS 
BUT OUR ATHLETES ARE A BIT LESS EXCITED BECAUSE THE VILLAGERS SEEM TO BE STICKING RAZOR SHARP 
PIRANHA TEETH INTO COCONUT SHELLS 
TRYING TO CONTROL THE BUTTERFLIES 
THE KALAPALO BELIEVE ONE WAY TO GAIN STRENGTH IS TO BLEED 
THIS IS A TEST OF MANHOOD 
SCREAM LIKE A GIRL AND YOU DON'T GET TO FIGHT 
SINK OR SWIM SINK OR SWIM 
DOES IT LEAVE A SCAR FOR A LONG TIME 
BRAD GOES FIRST 
WHAT BRAD DOESN'T KNOW IS THAT SCRAPING IS JUST THE START 
NEXT THEY'RE GOING TO RUB HIS OPEN WOUNDS WITH SALT AND CHILLIES 
NICE 
ONE TO TEN FIFTEEN 
IT'S BURNING LIKE HELL 
IT FEELS LIKE I'M ON FIRE RIGHT NOW 
RAJKO GETS IT IN THE ARM THAT FEELS GOOD 
YEAH THAT FEELS GOOD 
SHOT UP REAL QUICK DIDN'T IT YEAH 
THANK YOU 
BRAD AND RAJKO DIDN'T CRACK BUT THERE'S STILL RICHARD TO PICK ON 
AND THE LOCALS ARE BEGINNING TO ENJOY THEMSELVES 
QUITE SERIOUS PAIN ACTUALLY 
THIS CAN'T BE BAD 
I THINK YOUR WHOLE LEG IS GOING TO REALLY HURT 
TIME FOR THE CHILLIES AND SALT 
WOW WOW 
THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING 
THEY DIDN'T THINK WE'D DO IT 
IF YOU CUT YOURSELF GET SOME SALT AND PEPPER AND PUT IT IN THERE 
AND IMAGINE THAT OVER THE WHOLE LIMB THAT'S IT REALLY 
IT FEELS WORSE THAN POURING ALCOHOL ONTO A GAPING WOUND 
I DO KNOW HOW THAT FEELS AND I THINK THIS IS WORSE 
IT'S LIKE SLIDING DOWN A CHEESE GRATER 
AND THEN LANDING IN A BOWL FULL OF VINEGAR 
THE TORMENT IS OVER 
ALL THREE ARE NOW FINALLY ACCEPTED AS KALAPALO WARRIORS 
IT'S TEN DAYS SINCE OUR ATHLETES ARRIVED 
AND THE FESTIVAL OF DEATH IS ABOUT TO BEGIN 
TOMORROW RAJKO BRAD AND RICHARD WILL FIGHT IN THE CLIMAX OF THAT FESTIVAL 
THE LOSING ATHLETES HAVE BEEN INVITED BACK TO TAKE PART IN THE CEREMONIES 
FOR JASON AND COREY PREPARATIONS INCLUDE A LAST MINUTE HAIRCUT 
AH THAT WAS MY SKIN DUDE NOT COOL 
IT LOOKS LIKE OLD LADY'S HAIR GREAT THANK YOU 
DUDE IF HE PULLS A MIKE TYSON ON MY EAR 
THERE'S GONNA BE A FIST FIGHT 
OH MAN I REALLY LOOK LIKE I LOOKED IN FOURTH GRADE 
BLING BLING 
CLOSE BY BRAD RAJKO AND RICHARD HELP TO CARRY THE SPIRIT TREE LOGS 
INTO THE CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE 
EACH LOG REPRESENTS THE SOUL OF A RECENTLY DEAD VILLAGER 
THEIR PURPOSE IS TO ACT AS CHANNELS BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE AFTERLIFE 
THE KUARUP IS THE SECOND DEATH CEREMONY WHERE THE WHOLE VILLAGE HAS KIND OF THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO SEND THE SPIRITS TO 
TO THE HIGHER PLACE 
APPARENTLY THE KUARUP CEREMONY INVOLVES PAINTING THE LOGS AND THE LOGS REPRESENTING EACH BODY 
THE WHOLE VILLAGE COMES TOGETHER 
PAINTS ALL OF THE LOGS WITH VARIOUS SYMBOLS OF THAT PERSON'S LIFE 
OR REPRESENTATIONS OF THINGS THEY BELIEVE THAT PERSON 
BROUGHT TO THIS EARTH AND WILL CONTINUE TO BRING TO THE SPIRIT WORLD 
WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY DANCE WITH THE TRIBE 
IT'S GREAT TO ACTUALLY BE A PART OF THIS TYPE OF STUFF 
RATHER THAN JUST WRESTLE AND BE A PART OF THE THING THAT WAY 
SO THIS IS BECAUSE THIS IS THE LOSER THREE WE'RE 
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO TAKING PART IN THE REAL CELEBRATIONS 
IT'S JUST NICE KIND OF AN HONOUR TO BE A PART OF IT 
IT WAS LIKE BEING IN A TRANCE IN THAT LINE 
YOU FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE AND YOU JUST FELT LIKE YOU WERE THERE 
WITH EVERYONE ELSE IN THE VILLAGE AND NOTHING ELSE EXISTED 
YOU FORGET ABOUT ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING AND YOU'RE JUST JUST IN THIS 
YOU CAN JUST GO AND GO AND GO 
THEN AS THE DANCING REACHES ITS CLIMAX 
THE FAMILIES OF THE DEAD VILLAGERS ARRIVE TO MOURN AT THE SPIRIT TREES 
MY STEPGRANDFATHER HE PASSED AWAY YOU KNOW 
I HAD AN AUNT THAT PASSED AWAY 
AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE PASSED AWAY IN MY LIFE 
THAT I START TO REALLY FEEL FOR YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
SO I THINK EVEN IF WE WERE TO HAVE SAT DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND SHED SOME TEARS 
I THINK THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN COOL WITH IT 
I THINK I'VE GOT MORE TRUE OF A FEELING 
THAN MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER GUYS HAVE 
AND THAT I CAN DEFINITELY TAKE HOME WITH ME IN MY HEAD 
AND APPRECIATE A LOT MORE 
THE CLIMAX OF THE FESTIVAL IS JUST ONE NIGHT AWAY 
TOMORROW THREE OF OUR ATHLETES WILL FIGHT FOR THEIR TRIBE AND FOR THEMSELVES 
MAN MY HEAD'S IN THE GAME YOU KNOW 
JUST A FEW SHORT HOURS IT'S GOING TO BE TIME TO COMPETE 
I HAVE TO STEP FORWARD AND BEGIN THE SORT OF CIRCLE AND START CHANTING YOU KNOW FACE TO FACE 
WITH A WARRIOR WHO HAS A LOT OF PRIDE AT STAKE 
IT'S GOING TO BE DAUNTING 
MY STRATEGY IS TO GO OUT THERE AND GIVE THEM HELL REALLY 
MAKE IT REALLY HARD FOR THEM AND BE REALLY AGGRESSIVE 
IF YOU'VE GOT TO BE VIOLENT YOU'VE GOT TO BE VIOLENT 
BETTER HIM THAN ME 
IT'S THE DAY OF THE CONTEST 
BRAD RAJKO AND RICHARD ARE ABOUT TO BECOME THE FIRST WESTERNERS EVER 
TO FIGHT AS KALAPALO WARRIORS 
OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK AND GO THE BIG DUDE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE EVERYBODY NO PROBLEM 
HEY I LOVE PRESSURE 
PRESSURE JUST MAKES YOU EXCEL 
I KNOW THAT ON PAPER EVERYTHING LOOKS STACKED AGAINST ME BECAUSE I'M THE SMALLEST OUT OF THE THREE GUYS 
I JUST HAVE TO KID MYSELF BASICALLY SO TRYING TO CRUSH THE NERVES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 
I SUPPOSE I'M THE KIND OF PERSON WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL EVENT 
THAT'S WHEN I START REALLY KICKING INTO GEAR 
ONCE I'VE STARTED THAT PROCESS THEN I'LL BE ON FIRE READY FOR IT 
THE RIVAL TRIBES ARE COMING 
EACH HAS SENT ONLY ITS BEST AND BRAVEST WARRIORS 
THE WRESTLERS FORM A CIRCLE 
ANY OF THEM CAN ISSUE A CHALLENGE TO ANY OTHER WRESTLER 
OUR ATHLETES WILL BE REPRESENTING THE KALAPALO 
BUT THEY'LL ALSO BE FIGHTING FOR THEMSELVES 
IT'S A KNOCKOUT CONTEST 
WHOEVER PROGRESSES FURTHEST IN THE COMPETITION 
WILL BE THE LAST MAN STANDING 
THERE ARE THREE WAYS TO WIN 
GRAB YOUR OPPONENT'S LEG LIFT THEM OFF THE GROUND 
OR LIKE THIS WITH A THROW 
IF YOU BREAK APART IT'S A DRAW 
ONLY MINUTES INTO THE COMPETITION A CHAMPION FIGHTER FROM THE RIVAL AWALO PETI TRIBE 
ISSUES A CHALLENGE TO BRAD 
STEP UP INTO THE ARENA AND IT'S TIME TO HANDLE BUSINESS 
IN MY GAME PLAN THE WHOLE TIME HAS BEEN INTIMIDATION 
AND BRAD'S OPPONENT IS ABOUT TO START PLAYING DIRTY 
WITH A FISTFUL OF SAND IN HIS EYES BRAD IS FIGHTING BLIND 
AND QUICKLY LOSES TO A LEG GRAB 
IT SUCKS' 
I MEAN PEOPLE EVEN CAME UP AND TOLD ME IN THEIR LANGUAGE 
THAT HE HAD NO HONOUR AND SHOULD BE ASHAMED 
THROWING SAND IS NOT GOOD 
YEAH IT'S GETTING DIRTY AS DIRTY AS IT GETS BABY 
A FURIOUS RAJKO MOVES IN TO CHALLENGE BRAD'S OPPONENT 
BUT HE'S DENIED HIS CHANCE AND SENT BACK 
I TRIED TO TAKE THE SAME GUY BUT HE WOULDN'T TAKE IT BECAUSE I LOOKED DETERMINED 
THAT'S ER BOLLOCKS BASICALLY 
ANGERED BY THE FOUL PLAY THE KALAPALO CHIEF DEMANDS THAT BRAD BE ALLOWED TO FIGHT AGAIN 
CAN YOU SMELL THE MALE TESTOSTERONE 
I THINK IT'S FLOWING AT THE MOMENT 
THE CHIEF WINS HIS APPEAL 
BRAD WILL STAY IN THE COMPETITION 
THE NEXT ATHLETE INTO THE RING IS RICHARD 
AND HE'S UP AGAINST THE SAND THROWING CHEAT THAT FOUGHT BRAD 
THESE OTHER TRIBES THEY WON'T LET US MAKE FRIENDS THEY WANT TO KICK OUR ARSES 
IT WAS A DAUNTING FEELING THAT CAME ACROSS 
AND SEEING THESE GUYS YOU KNOW MAYBE SMILING AT THEM 
AND GETTING STONY STARE BACK IN YOUR FACE 
RICHARD LOSES AND IS OUT OF THE COMPETITION 
HE HAD A BIG BALD HEAD AND WILD EYES 
HUGE SOLID FRAME AND ALL I WAS THINKING WAS JUST DON'T GET FLIPPED DON'T LET YOUR KNEES GET GRABBED 
UNFORTUNATELY AT THE END HE DID A MOVE WHICH I TRIED TO ROLL OUT OF 
BUT IN ROLLING I ROLLED ONTO MY BACK AND THAT DISQUALIFIED ME 
SO IT'S NOT A DISGRACEFUL WAY TO GO 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE 
FOR THE WHOLE DAY THE KALAPALO TEAM TAKE ON THE NEIGHBOURING TRIBES 
FINALLY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON BRAD GETS HIS SECOND CHANCE 
IT ALMOST FELT LIKE YOU KNOW I WAS TRULY A GLADIATOR AND I WAS IN THE ARENA BATTLING FOR MY LIFE 
I'M NOT LOSING 
BRAD'S OPPONENT CLAIMS VICTORY 
BUT BECAUSE THEY BROKE APART THE CHIEF DECLARES THE FIGHT A DRAW 
ENTER RAJKO 
WITH RICHARD OUT AND BRAD DRAWN IF HE CAN WIN JUST ONE FIGHT HE'LL ALSO WIN THE ATHLETES' COMPETITION 
I DO BELIEVE EVERYTHING STARTS IN YOUR MIND 
IF YOUR MIND IS STRONG ENOUGH AND YOU SEE SOMETHING CLEAR ENOUGH IN YOUR MIND ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE 
RAJKO IS GIVING IT ALL HE'S GOT BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH 
THE ATHLETES' CONTEST IS OVER 
AS FOR THEIR VILLAGE HAVING SCORED THE MOST VICTORIES 
THE KALAPALO TEAM IS DECLARED OVERALL WINNER 
BUT WHICH OF OUR ATHLETES PERFORMED BEST 
ONLY THE CHIEF CAN DECIDE 
THE SHAMAN WAS RIGHT BRAD WAS THE CHOSEN ONE 
MAN I'M PROUD I'M PROUD OF MYSELF AT THAT MOMENT 
FIRST CHALLENGE WAS SET BEFORE US AND I WENT IN THINKING I'M GOING TO WIN IT I LEFT WINNING IT 
AS A SHOW OF RESPECT THE RIVAL CHIEF WIPES BRAD'S SWEAT ONTO HIS MEN 
BLESSING THEM WITH HIS POWER AND STRENGTH 
THAT OUT OF EVERYTHING WAS THE THING THAT MEANT THE MOST TO ME 
THAT THEY SEE ME AS A WARRIOR 
BRAD IS THE LAST MAN STANDING 
THAT'S RIGHT I'M BRAD 
NEXT TIME ON LAST MAN STANDING 
WE ARE ABOUT TO GO INTO BATTLE 
OH 
THE ATHLETES TAKE ON ZULU STICK FIGHTERS 
DAMN RIGHT IT'S SCARY 
SHITTIN' A BRICK 
AGAINST THE BEST GUYS I'M JUST GOING TO GET BEAT TO SHIT 
AS SOON AS YOU GO IN THERE YOUR HEART STARTS GOING BOOM BOOM 
HOW AM I GOING TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME 
I THINK WE'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE 
OW 
ADRENALINE
