HELLO THERE IT'S THE PENULTIMATE 
WEEKEND OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
SEASON AND IT COULD HARDLY BE 
TIGHTER AT BOTH ENDS OF THE TABLE 
ON MATCH OF THE DAY THIS WEEK 
WE'LL SEE THE LEAGUE LEADERS AND 
ALL THOSE UNDER THREAT OF THE DROP 
ALL THAT AND THE APRIL GOAL OF THE 
MONTH COMPETITION ALAN HANSEN AND 
ALAN SHEARER CAN HARDLY CONTAIN 
THEIR EXCITEMENT WE START WITH THE 
CHAMPIONS MANCHESTER UNITED TO 
DEFEND THEIR CROWN ALL THAT WAS 
REQUIRED WAS TWO VICTORIES THE 
FIRST THOUGH WAS AGAINST THEIR 
BOGEY SIDE WEST HAM HAVE WON ON 
THEIR LAST THREE MEETINGS THE 
COMMENTATOR AT OLD TRAFFORD WAS 
STEVE WILSON TWO TROPHIES TO BE DECIDED IN THREE 
GAMES A TWO MATCH A TITLE RACE STARTS 
TODAY AND THEN THAT IT IS MOSCOW A 
SEASON DISTILLED INTO TWO AND A 
HALF WEEKS FOR MANCHESTER UNITED 
IS THE ADRENALIN OF VICTORY STILL 
PLUNGING THROUGH THEIR VEINS OR HAS 
WON A HALF A TIGHTENED ON THE 
ELUSIVE EUROPEAN CUP AS ANOTHER 
WEAKENS ON THE FAMILIAR PREMIER 
LEAGUE CROWD THE NEXT NINETY MINUTES 
WILL BE TELLING AND MAY BE DECISIVE 
MANCHESTER UNITED ARE NOT CHANGED 
NEMANJA VIDIC AND WAYNE ROONEY ARE 
BOTH OUT ALTHOUGH SIR ALEX FERGUSON 
SAYS WAYNE ROONEY WILL BE FIT FOR 
MOSCOW PATRICE EVRA PASSED A 
FITNESS TEST WEST HAM MAKE TWO CHANGES FREDDIE 
LJUNGBERG'S ROBES SEES LUIS BOA 
MORTE DAY AND HAYDEN MULLINS COME 
IN RIBS ALAN CURBISHLEY WILL PROBABLY WISH 
HE KEPT HIS THOUGHTS TO INSULT THIS 
WEEK SIXTEEN TIMES AND CHAMPIONS OF 
ENGLAND MANCHESTER UNITED TWO 
GAMES AWAY FROM THE TITLE AGAIN 
FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IN THE FIRST 
HALF AGAINST WEST HAM WHO HAVE 
BEEN THEIR NEMESIS IN RECENT YEARS 
AND LAUNCHED THE FIRST ATTACK IN 
THE GAME WITH BOBBY ZAMORA CRISTIANO RONALDO ONE TO ZERO MANCHESTER 
NIGHT IT TOOK AL DEFLECTION IT IS 
ANOTHER'S GOAL HIS THIRTY NINTH OF THE 
SEASON ONE TO ZERO THREE MINUTES ON THE CLOCK 
CRISTIANO RONALDO HE BEAT LUCAS 
NEILL HE HAD THE DEFENCE BACK 
PEDALLING FLICKED OFF MCCARTNEY 
ONE TO ZERO MANCHESTER UNITED THE NERVES 
IF THERE WERE ANY HAVE EVAPORATED 
AROUND OLD TRAFFORD JUST WHAT THE 
DOCTOR ORDERED CRISTIANO RONALDO 
WHO ELSE PROVIDES LAUNCHED IN TOWARDS ASHTON BY JOHN PANTSIL IT IS A WEST HAM CORNER EDWIN VAN DER SAR NEEDED HELP FROM 
PATRICE EVRA TO WALK IT OFF THE 
LINE EDWIN VAN DER SAR CAME FOR THE CORNER BOBBY ZAMORA GOT THE CRASH BUT THE 
CRUCIAL ONE WAS FROM A PATRICE EVRA 
THEY HAVE LOST FOUR OF THEIR LAST 
FIVE AWAY FROM HOME ALAN 
CURBISHLEY'S WEST HAM THE OTHER 
WAS A DRAW A SHAKE OF THE HEAD IT 
SUGGESTS THAT ALAN CURBISHLEY IS 
ALREADY FEARING THE WORST YEAR 
HANDBALL BY WES BROWN HE WAS 
PUSHED INTO IT BY BOBBY ZAMORA 
THAT'S THE DECISION BY MIKE RILEY 
OTHERWISE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
PENALTY MIKE RILEY HAS A 
COMPLETELY UNIMPEDED VIEW OF IT 
THAT'S A BIG DECISION FROM MIKE 
RILEY IT REALLY IS A REAL DANGER HERE IT CARLOS TEVEZ RUNNING AT LUCAS NEILL'S CLEARANCE FROM JAMES TOMPKINS A 
NINETEEN YEAR OLD FIND HIMSELF IN THE 
BIGGER STAGE OF HIS CAREER FINDS 
HIMSELF BACK PEDALLING TOWARDS HIS 
OWN GOAL A BIG MOMENT FOR THE 
YOUNGSTER FACING HIS OWN NET 
HARGREAVES TOMKINS MISSED IT CRISTIANO 
RONALDO HAS FORTY AND MANCHESTER 
UNITED HAVE TWO WHAT AN 
EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENT FROM AN 
EXTRAORDINARY FOOTBALLER HARGREAVES KILLED IT IN JAMES TOMKINS AT THE BACK MISSED IT CRISTIANO RONALDO TWO TO ZERO MANCHESTER UNITED FORTY GOALS WITHOUT EVEN PLAYING WITH 
HIS STRIKING PARTNER OF THE TIME 
TEVEZ BRILLIANT IT'S A ROMP FOR MANCHESTER UNITED 
AS THEY STRIDE TOWARDS THE FINISH 
LINE CARLOS TEVEZ WHO SCORED THE 
GOAL THAT KEPT WEST HAM IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE LAST SEASON 
UNLEASHES A ZINGER INTO THE BACK OF 
THE WEST HAM UNITED NET EVEN THE 
WEST HAM FANS MANAGED TO SMILE AT 
THE SITE OF THIS ASHTON WITH HALF A CHANCE DEAN ASHTON A MAGNIFICENT GOAL WHATEVER MANCHESTER UNITED DO TODAY 
THEY WILL DO WELL TO SCORE A BETTER 
GOAL THAN THAT BROWN AND FERDINAND UNSETTLED 
BROWN'S MISTAKE REALLY BUT WHAT 
ABOUT THIS FOR A FINISH FROM DEAN 
ASHTON HIS FIFTIETH WEST HAM GAME HIS 
SIXTEENTH AND POSSIBLY BEST GOAL FOR 
THEM HE LOOKS TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIS 
GROIN OR HIS THIGH MAYBE IT WAS 
TOO ACROBATIC TEVEZ FOR MANCHESTER UNITED RONALDO WANTS IT NANI HAYDEN MULLINS WAS THERE THERE WAS 
AN EXCHANGE WITH NANI WHO ARE 
STUCK HIS FOREHEAD INTO LUCAS NEILL 
WHAT DID MIKE RILEY SEE TO THAT 
MAYBE A LITTLE SLAP FROM LUCAS 
NEILL AND THEN THE HEAD GOES IN 
FROM NANI WHO THINKS WHAT HAVE I 
DONE HERE L. HAD BETTER GO DOWN TOO THAT IS A HUGE PAWN HE MAY HAVE BEEN SLAPPED HE MAY 
GET A RED CARD THE RED CARD IS 
COMING OUT I'M AFRAID NANI THE 
PLAY ACTING HAS NOT SAVED HIM HE 
IS SENT OFF WHILST MIKE DEAN THE FOURTH OFFICIAL 
HE IS THE OPINION OF SIR ALEX 
FERGUSON IT HAS TO BE THE RIGHT 
DECISION HE HEARS THE OPINION OF 
ALEX FERGUSON NANI HAS ONLY ONE 
PERSON TO BLAME HIMSELF JOHN PANTSIL TENTATIVELY INTO THE PENALTY AREA LUIS BOA 
MORTE IS THERE SCOTT PARKER FOR 
WEST HAM HE TRIED TO KILL IT OFF 
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF HIS BOOT 
GOALWARDS AND ENDED UP POKING IT 
WIDE BUT IT WAS A CHANCE FOR WEST 
HAM AND MANCHESTER UNITED WERE IN 
TROUBLE SPECTATOR WAYNE ROONEY 
BUT SIR ALEX FERGUSON HAS SAID IT 
IS NONSENSE TO SUGGEST HE NEEDS AN 
OPERATION NONSENSE TO SUGGEST HE 
WILL MISS THE MOSCOW CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE FINAL NEMANJA VIDIC 
ALONGSIDE BOTH MISSING TODAY DEFLECTED FOUR TO ONE MANCHESTER UNITED MICHAEL KARIC AGAINST HIS FORMER 
CLUB HE SURELY MS. THE HOPES OF HIS 
FORMER CLUB MICHAEL KARIC HE 
SURELY ENDS OF THE HOPE OF HIS 
FORMER CLUB ANOTHER DEFLECTION GOES 
MANCHESTER UNITED'S WAY BUT IT'S 
FOUR ONE MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE 
MADE A CHANGE PARK JI SUNG IS 
REPLACED BY A RYAN GIGGS SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN 
MANCHESTER UNITED APPEARANCES RYAN 
GIGGS MAY SURPASS HIS RECORD IN 
MOSCOW AT THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
FINAL RYAN GIGGS FLETCHER IT IS OFF THE INSIDE OF THE POST GREAT COUNTER ATTACKING MOVEMENT FOR MANCHESTER UNITED IT DESERVED A GOAL IF MANCHESTER UNITED WIN AT WIGAN 
NEXT WEEKEND THEY ARE CHAMPIONS 
AGAIN AND NOTHING CHELSEA DO WILL 
MAKE A JOT OF DIFFERENCE CRISTIANO 
RONALDO WAS TWO TEVEZ AND MICHAEL 
KARIC WITH THE OTHERS MANCHESTER 
UNITED HAD TEN MEN FOR MORE THAN 
HALF THE GAME BUT SWEPT WEST HAM 
UNITED ASIDE THE STRETFORD END 
WILL NOT SEE SILVERWARE TODAY BUT 
THEY SURELY WILL SOON 
SO DELIGHTED WAS ALEX FERGUSON THAT 
HE SPOKE TO US AFTER THE GAME WELL 
SORT OF 
FIRST OF ALL I THINK WE 
SHOULD APPLAUD THE EFFORTS OF THE 
PLAYERS THIS SEASON THEY HAVE BEEN 
FANTASTIC 
AS THE LADS AND MAKE A LAP OF 
HONOUR A TRIBUTE TO YOU THE FANS 
COME ENJOY YOURSELF IN MOSCOW AND 
HOPEFULLY NEXT WEEK AT WIGAN WELL 
DONE 
FORTY GOALS THIS SEASON THAT IS DONE MAGNIFICO AND MAGNIFICENT 
WONDERFUL FUNNY IT IS GREAT 
SEASON FOR ME IF YOU'RE IN THE 
NEXT GAME FEW IN THE GAME 
AGAINST WIGAN FUNNY IT IS A 
SPECTACULAR SEASON FOR ME ANY ANY DISAPPOINTMENT 
THERE IS NO DISAPPOINTMENT ULTERIOR MOTIVE ALAIN ASKED ME TO 
DO THE PRESS THAT IS IT HE 
CERTAINLY PUSHED HIS HEAD THEY 
SAID HE BRUSHED HIS HEAD INTO LUCAS 
NEILL'S FACE WHETHER THAT WAS THE 
CASE I DON'T KNOW L. DO NOT THINK 
ANYBODY WOULD HAVE COME BACK AFTER 
THE DEFLECTION 
A IF WE WIN IT WE 
WIN THE LEAGUE IF YOU HAD GIVEN US 
THAT AT THE OF THE SEASON WE 
WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT WE JUST HAD DO 
FINISH THE JOB OFF NOW HAVE TO 
THAT WAS A LOT EASIER THAN PERHAPS 
WE EXPECTED 
IT IS THE TYPE OF GAME 
THAT YOU DREAM OF WHEN YOU ARE 
GOING FOREHEAD CHAMPIONSHIP YOU 
EXPECT THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE THE 
NECESSARY COMMITMENT TO COSSIE 
PROBLEMS BUT WEST HAM BASIC T. DID 
NOT TURN UP CAUSE YOU PROBLEMS 
THEY WERE RESIGNED TO MID TABLE 
MEDIOCRITY THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A 
BEACH SOMEWHERE AT NO STAGE DID 
THEY GET TIGHT ENOUGH QUICKLY 
ENOUGH RONALDO SCORED AFTER FOUR 
MINUTES AND AFTER THAT IT WAS JUST 
A POSITION WHERE YOU KNEW WEST HAM 
WOULD NOT CAUSE THEM ANY PROBLEMS YOU HAVE TO CONCENTRATE 
AND FOCUS AND DO NOT LET RONALDO GET AWAY 
FROM YOU AT THE END OF THE CLUB WE 
SEE LUCAS NEILL GET SQUARE TO 
RONALDO WHEN HE IS QUITE TO THE 
DINETTE HE IS IN TROUBLE HE 
SQUARE TO THE TARGET MCCARTNEY 
SHOULD HAVE COME TO THE BALL BUT HE 
LET RONALDO COME ON HE BACKS OFF 
AND IT IS IN THE BACK THE 
GOALKEEPER ROBERT GREEN CANNOT 
BELIEVE WHAT IS GOING ON TWENTY 
MINUTES LATER IT IS A HALF HEARTED 
CHALLENGE NOT A GREAT BALL INTO 
THE BOX SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEFEND 
IT TOMKINS LET IT GO AGAINST TEN 
MEN YOU EXPECT THEM TO COME BACK 
MICHAEL CARRICK PICKS UP ONE TOUCH 
NO CHALLENGE DEFLECT IN THE BACK 
OF THE NET AND IT IS ALL OVER IT 
WAS TERRIBLE FROM WEST HAM 
A BLOT ON UNITED'S COPYBOOK FROM 
NANI 
I SUGGEST ALEX FERGUSON WENT NANI BALLISTIC OVER THIS BUT IF IT HAD 
COST UNITED HE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
FURIOUS 
MAYBE HE SLAPPED HIM THAT YOU 
CANNOT DEFEND THAT ABUL THAT IS 
ABSOLUTELY CRAZY SUTTON BUT YOU 
CANNOT DEFEND THAT AT ALL 
IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE ALL RIGHT 
RETRIBUTION BECAUSE LUCAS NEILL HAD 
A GO AT HIM BUT THAT WAS CRAZY BUT 
HE GOT AWAY WITH IT 
HE KEPT WEST 
HAM UP LAST SEASON BUT TODAY TEVEZ 
DID IT AT THE OTHER END 
JUST A TOP 
PLAYER HE DID THAT FOR WEST HAM 
LAST YEAR BUT IT WAS ROLES 
REVERSED THIS YEAR HE CREATES THE 
SPACE AND MULLINS LETS INCOME HE 
INVITED IN TO SHOOT INVITED HIM 
NOT MANY HOME PLAYERS GET THEIR 
RECEPTION LIKE THAT FROM THE AWAY 
FANS AT OLD TRAFFORD 
WE HAVE SEEN 
GREAT MANAGEMENT FROM FERGUSON NOT 
A HINT OF NEGATIVITY NO MENTION OF 
BEING TIRED OR INJURIES HE HAS 
BEEN UNBELIEVABLY POSITIVE AND IT 
HAS PAID REWARDS 
CHELSEA HAVE IT 
ALL TO DO 
IT WILL BE A LOT TOUGHER THAN MAN 
UNITED'S GAME WAS TODAY WOULD 
NOT PUT IT PAST THAN TO GO THERE 
AND TAKE IT TO THE WIRE IT IS THE 
LAST GAME OF THE SEASON IT IS 
TIGHT 
THEY ARE HALFWAY THERE THEY TIGHT HAVE TO WIN TWO MATCHES THEY GO TO 
BEGIN NEXT WEEK IT IS THEIRS FOR 
THE TAKING 
FROM HEREON IN IT IS 
THE QUESTION OF AVOIDING RELEGATION 
THAT CONCENTRATES OUR THOUGHTS NINETEEN 
T. H. PLAYS FULHAM PLAYED EIGHTEEN A MOORE 
PLACED FULHAM BIRMINGHAM THE REWARD FOR DIOMANSY KAMARA'S 
TWO GOALS IN THE PREVIOUS MATCH IS 
A PLACE IN THE STARTING LINE UP 
THE GOALKEEPER MAIK TAYLOR SPENT 
SEVEN SEASONS AT FULHAM MAKING TWO HUNDRED 
APPEARANCES AND HELPING THEM 
ACHIEVE THE PREMIERSHIP STATUS THAT 
BOTH CLUBS COULD NOW LOSE ALEX 
MCLEISH THE MANAGER OF BIRMINGHAM 
CITY THEY HAVE NOT HAD AN AWAY WIN 
SINCE HIS FIRST GAME AT ON HIM ON 
THE BENCH ROY HODGSON AND RAY 
LEWINGTON THEY ARE SMILING AT THE 
MOMENT BUT THEY KNOW A WIN IS 
ESSENTIAL MCBRIDE OFFSIDE BUT WAS THE OFFSIDE I THINK MAIK TAYLOR MAY HAVE JUST 
PUT THAT ONTO THE BAR THE MAN WITH 
THE WHITE HAIR IS PETER CHAPLAIN 
APPROACHING HIS EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY HE 
WAS ACTUALLY BORN IT IN CRAVEN 
COTTAGE AND LIVED THERE WHILE HIS 
FATHER ALEC WAS CAPTAIN OF FULHAM 
HE HAS NOT BEEN BACK TO THE GROUND 
FOR SEVENTY SIX YEARS FOUL FULHAM HAVE A FREE KICK IT IS A THREATENING POSITION POLLARD IS A FREE KICK SPECIALIST WHAT A FINE SAVE BY MAIK TAYLOR THE FREE KICK WAS WELL DISGUISED 
BUT THAT WAS A SUPREME PIECE OF 
GOALKEEPING SIMON DAVIES MUST HAVE 
THOUGHT THAT WAS ON ITS WAY IN MIKAEL FORSELL A PIECE OF BAD CONTROL THAT MIGHT PLAYED HIM A BIT BECAUSE 
IT WAS A REAL CHANCE FOR BIRMINGHAM 
CITY PLAGUE FORSELL COULD NOT 
GET THE BALL UNDER CONTROL FULHAM 
WERE NO MOHAMED AL FAYED WENT TO 
THE DRESSING ROOM TO SPEED TO THE 
PLAYERS BEFORE THE GAME ENOUGH REAL GOOD INTELLIGENT DEFENDING BY 
AARON HUGHES AT ONE MOMENT HE WAS 
CHASING MCFADDEN BUT THEN HE SAW 
THE DANGER HE PREVENTED MIKAEL 
FORSELL FROM GETTING ON THE END OF 
IT 
THE FULHAM FANS ARE DOING THEIR IT BEST TO BRING THE FEEL GOOD FACTOR 
TO THE OCCASION BUT THERE IS SO 
MUCH ATTENTION ATTENTION THE BACK HEEL BY DANNY MURPHY DID 
NOT QUITE WORK BUT I DO NOT THINK 
HE WAS FOULED IT WILL BE A YELLOW CARD FOR SIMULATION JAIDI WHAT A GOOD DIVING MCBRIDE TOOK ONE ON THE SIDE OF THE 
HEAD FROM JAIDI IT IS FREE KICK TO FULHAM FULHAM SCORED WHO ELSE COULD IT BE 
BUT BRIAN MCBRIDE SEVEN MINUTES 
INTO THE SECOND HALF IS THIS A 
LIFELINE FOR FULHAM MCBRIDE WHO 
THEY MISSED SO BADLY WHEN HE WAS 
OUT FROM AUGUST UNTIL JANUARY THIS 
IS A TYPICAL GOAL FROM HIM SUDDENLY THERE IS OPTIMISM AROUND CRAVEN COTTAGE THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY FOR SURVIVAL FROM THE SUBLIME TO THE RIDICULOUS REALLY MAYBE ON SECOND THOUGHTS HE COULD 
HAVE SQUARED IT 
THE BIG FEAR FOR 
FULHAM IS THAT THEY CONCEDED A HUGE 
NUMBER OF LATE GOALS THIS SEASON 
ROY HODGSON WILL BE PRAYING THIS 
DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN TODAY DO NOT GIVE MCFADDEN MUCH SPACE OR 
HE WILL MAKE YOU PAY KAMARA IS 
INJURED ERIK NEVLAND THE 
NORWEGIAN WHO SCORED AT READING 
RECENTLY FOR FULHAM IS COMING ON 
TO REPLACE HIM THAT WAS TOO DEEP 
FOR MCBRIDE YOU REALLY FEEL THAT A SECOND GOAL FOR FULHAM WOULD TRY IT UP NOW TIE IT UP IF IT 
DO S. 
NOT COME THE 
ANXIETY WILL INCREASE CAN FULHAM OLD FIRM HOW DID THAT STAY OUT THE REFEREE HAS GIVEN GOAL KICK THEY WONDERED WHETHER IT WAS A GOAL 
KICK BORO FREE KICK A BIRMINGHAM 
APPEALING FOR A CORNER ARE 
BIRMINGHAM JODY'S HEADER FROM ONE ANGLE IT 
LOOKED AS IF IT WAS GOING IN ERIK 
NEVLAND HAS GOT IT IS TWO TO ZERO AND 
FULHAM SMELL SURVIVAL IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE ROY HODGSON SAID IT TO ME BEFORE 
THE GAME HE IS BETTER COMING ON AS 
A SUBSTITUTE THAN STARTING AND I 
TELL YOU WHAT HE HAS PROVED THAT 
HERE FULHAM 
HAVE A TWO TO ZERO LEAD L. HAVE TO SAY ON THE SECOND HALF 
PERFORMANCE BIRMINGHAM DON'T 
REALLY DESERVE ANY BETTER THAN THIS 
DAVID HEALY HERE PLAYING TO HIS 
LEFT SIMON DAVIES MAIK TAYLOR 
MAKES THE SAVE BUT ITS FORTY NINE MINUTES 
ON THE CLOCK AND SURELY THE REFEREE 
WILL BE BLOWING ANY SECOND HERE FALL ON GO TO PORTSMOUTH ON THE 
LAST DAY OF THE SEASON PRESUMABLY 
WITH THEIR SURVIVAL PROSPECTS STILL 
INTACT FULHAM WHAT A DAY 
GOODNESS ME WENT TO BIRMINGHAM 
BAD 
IT WAS A GAME WE HAD TO WIN AND I 
THINK WE DID IT IN SOME STYLE WITH 
OUR CROWD AND AT VERY ENCOURAGING 
WE ARE GETTING SUCH A GREAT 
RECEPTION FROM THE CROWD WHO HAVE 
BEEN MAGNIFICENT ALL SEASON THEY 
ARE ASSUMING WE DON'T HAVE ANY 
FURTHER PROBLEMS BUT WE DO THE THE PLAYERS WERE NERVOUS AND THEY DID 
NOT GET THEIR FINISHING TOUCHES WE 
HAD A COUPLE OF DECENT 
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FIRST HALF AND 
THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO CAPITALISE 
GREAT FREE KICK GREAT ONE FOR 
JIMMY YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP ON 
CONCENTRATING WE JUST CAME THROUGH 
YOU HAVE GOT SMILE ON YOUR FACE 
ABSOLUTELY IT'S GREAT TO SCORE IN 
A GAME LIKE THIS ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST GAMES I HAVE EVER BEEN IN 
HOW BIG CHALLENGE IS THIS FOR YOU YOU IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY I DON'T YOU SEE IT AS A THREAT BUT AN 
OPPORTUNITY 
FULHAM HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES A 
GENUINE CHANCE FOR SURVIVAL 
NO ONE 
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS AGO BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO GIVE 
THEM CREDIT THEY PLAYED O. K. TODAY 
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE TO PLAY 
THAT WELL BECAUSE BIRMINGHAM WERE 
SO POOR FULHAM WERE CREATING THE 
CHANCES AND WERE GOING TO SCORE 
GOALS DEFENSIVELY BIRMINGHAM WERE 
POOR GOING FORWARD THEY DID NOT 
HAVE ANY EFFORT ON TARGET 
WHATSOEVER THIS IS WHAT I CAN PULL 
OUT OF THEY WERE SO SLOPPY WHEN 
THEY GOT INTO DECENT POSITIONS 
LARSSON TO MIKAEL FORSSELL NO 
GREAT MOVEMENT FROM MCFADDEN HE 
SHOULD HAVE HIT THE TARGET THIS 
SUMS THEM UP GOING FORWARD HERE 
SLOPPY CARELESS AND CLUMSY IF 
THEY WERE STILL THERE NOW 
BIRMINGHAM THEY STILL WOULDN'T 
HAVE SCORED 
FULHAM HAVE REALLY 
TURNED THEIR SEASON AROUND YOU YOU HAVE GOT TO GIVE THEM CREDIT THEY 
WERE VERY DANGEROUS FROM SET PIECES 
BIRMINGHAM COULD NOT HANDLE THEM 
THEY COULD HAVE SCORED MORE THAN 
ONE AND THEY DID WHAT WE HAVE GOT 
HERE THE SHADED AREA HERE THAT'S 
WHERE THE PLAYERS WANT TO RUN INTO 
FOR THE DECOY FOR SIMON DAVIES TO 
RUN INTO THIS SPACE THERE AND IT 
WORKS A TREAT FOR FULHAM IT REALLY 
DOES IT'S A FANTASTIC SAVE FROM 
MAIK TAYLOR ANOTHER FREE KICK FROM 
JIMMY BULLARD INTO BRIAN MCBRIDE 
WHO IS THEIR MAIN THREAT FORM 
MCBRIDE NO ONE IS WITHIN TWO OR 
THREE YARDS OF HIM L. DON'T KNOW 
WHAT FRANCK QUEUDRUE IS DOING HE 
PUT IT ON A PLATE A GREAT FINISH 
A GREAT DAY FOR FULHAM AND WHAT A 
GREAT CHANCE THEY HAVE GIVEN 
THEMSELVES 
A GREAT ESCAPE WHAT A THEMSELVES JOB HODGSON HAS DONE 
A GREAT 
FINALE FOR THE SEASON THAT WIN FOR 
FULHAM MEANT THAT READING REALLY 
NEEDED THREE POINTS AGAINST SPURS 
TO EASE THEIR RELEGATION WORRIES 
THE FACT THEY HAVEN'T SCORED SINCE 
MARCH WAS A MAJOR CONCERN SIMON 
BROTHERTON WAS AT THE MADEJSKI 
STADIUM READING ARE UNCHANGED WHILE THEY 
LOOK FOR THE FIRST GOAL IN SIX 
MATCHES TOM HUDDLESTON STARTS 
INSTEAD OF ARAN LEMON ARAN 
LENNON ROBBIE KEANE LEAVES IT FOR 
DARREN BENT HUDDLESTON STEED MALBRANQUE THE READING CAPTAIN STAYED WITH INGEMAR SOME IS THAT THE PLAN TO GET OUT OF JAIL 
FOR STEVE COPPELL'S TEAM TO GET OUT 
OF THIS GAME THEY WILL NEED TO BE 
ALERT MARK IS HAMANN WILL SURELY 
THEIR HEADS OF ROBBIE KEANE HE 
KEPT HIS ONE HUNDRED CLEAN SHEET IN A 
READING SHIRTS A FEW WEEKS AGO HE 
USES HIS LEFT SHIN TO PRESERVE HIS 
CLEAN SHEET THIS TIME DARREN BEN TO SUPPORTED BY ONE TO ZERO ROBBIE KEANE HAS CAUSED AGAINST 
READING AND READING THE'S PLIGHT 
HAS JUST GOT A LITTLE BIT WORSE 
THEIR POSITION IS LITTLE BIT MORE 
DIFFICULT THE CHALLENGE ON A 
ROBBIE KEANE THE REFEREE PLAYS THE 
ADVANTAGE AND IT DID TURN INTO 
THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE 
HAVE FINISHED 
OFF THE MOVER GOAL NUMBER TWENTY THREE FOR 
THIS SEASON FOR HIM THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME LEFT FOR 
READING TO FINE FORM THIS SEASON 
THEY KNOW IT FIND FORM THIS 
SEASON STEED MALBRANQUE JERMAINE JENAS WHAT A SPOT TO WIN A FREE KICK AS 
WELL IT WAS SOFT FREE KICK 
STEVE MALBRANQUE TRIED TO CUT 
INSIDE THESE ARE VERY ANXIOUS MOMENTS FOR 
READING WHAT GOOD SAVE JUST 
WHAT READING REQUIRED GOOD FREE 
KICK FROM ROBBIE KEANE NEARLY HAD 
TWO GOALS IN SIX MINUTES THERE 
READING CAN'T GET THE BALL AT THE 
MOMENT IT'S ALL ABOUT TOTTENHAM IT'S A BRILLIANT PLAYER OFFSIDE THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL 
PUTTING THE BALL IN THE BACK OF THE 
NET BUT THE OFFSIDE FLAG HAS GONE 
UP ON THE FAR SIDE AS THE BALL IS 
PLAYED FOR WOOD LET'S HAVE A 
LITTLE LOOK AT THIS ONE I'M NOT 
SURE HE IS OFFSIDE THERE THINK 
TOTTENHAM HAVE BEEN DENIED AN 
EXCELLENT GOAL THE FLAG STAYS DOWN ROBBIE KEANE 
IS COMMISSION MARKS STEVE 
MALBRANQUE SO CLOSE TO A SECOND GOAL THEIR FOR 
TOTTENHAM ROBBIE KEANE IS ON SIDE 
AND STEVE MALBRANQUE MIGHTILY 
CLOSE TO A SECOND GOAL OF THE 
AFTERNOON AWAY BY WOODGATE A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH OF THAT FROM 
THE HOME SIDE JERMAINE JENAS 
STEED MALBRANQUE IS TO HIS LEFT 
READING JUST NOT GETTING INTO THE 
TOTTENHAM PLAYERS HERE STAYED 
MALBRANQUE END NOT MUCH ROOM TO WORK IN 
SURROUNDED BY PLAYERS A BRILLIANT 
IMPROVISATION A TO THINK TWELVE MONTHS AGO THOSE 
SAME FANS WERE CONTEMPLATING THE 
POSSIBILITY OF THE UEFA CUP 
FOOTBALL READING WERE NOT FAR AWAY 
FROM SECURING IT LEROY LITRE A COMFORTABLE SAVE HE HASN'T HAD TOO MANY SAVES TO MAKE HE IS A CHANCE NOW CORNER IT'S A BETTER SPELL FOR STEVE 
COPPELL'S TEAM THE LAST FIVE 
MINUTES TOTTENHAM HAVE DROPPED THIRTY THREE 
POINTS FROM WINNING POSITIONS THIS 
SEASON THE WORST RECORD IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE ERA READING HOPE 
THEY ARE GOING TO DROP SOME MORE 
NOW THAT'S THE CLOSEST READING HAVE COME THE SHOT NOT FAR WIDE GAVE KITSON HARPER MADE THE RUN GILBERTO THAT WAS SUCH A LUCKY BREAK FOR READING HAVE HAD AN ONSIDE GOAL DISALLOWED 
AND NOW THEY HAVE BEEN IT DENIED BY 
THE WOODWORK SEVEN AND ONE HALF MINUTES 
REMAINING HERE APPEALS FOR HAND BALL BUT THE 
REFEREE SAYS NO IT MAY HAVE STRUCK 
HIM ON THE ARM BUT I DON'T THINK 
HE WAS STICKING HIS ARM OUT TO STOP 
THE BALL TIME ARE STARTING TO RUN 
SHORT NOW WE ARE HEADING FOR THE 
LAST FIVE MINUTES IT'S A GREAT SAVE KIT SOME SO 
CLOSE TO AN EQUALISER DAVE 
KITSON PLENTY OF GOALS IN READING MATCHES 
THIS SEASON BUT THE PROBLEM IS 
THEY HAVE ALL BUT THE WRONG END 
THEY CAN'T BUY A GOAL AT THE MOMENT IT WAS CLAWED AWAY TWICE IN TWO 
MINUTES BRILLIANT GOALKEEPING 
ROSSINI ARE SO CLOSE TO HIS FIRST 
GOAL FOR READING STEVE COPPELL 
KNOWS IT IS GOING TO GO TO THE WIRE 
NOT QUITE WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND 
TODAY 
IT'S A QUESTION OF WHO TODAY IMPOSES THEIR STYLE ON WHO THEY 
HAD BETTER QUALITY PLAYERS AND 
WERE MORE COMFORTABLE IN POSSESSION 
WE GAVE IT AWAY QUICKLY ROBBIE 
KEANE WAS DIFFICULT TO GET HOLD OF 
THEY ARE GOOD IF ANYTHING THEY 
MASSIVELY UNDER ACHIEVED THIS 
SEASON 
HOW FRUSTRATING IS THAT FOR SEASON YOU ON THE BENCH WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH 
A NARROW LEAD 
IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S 
TRUE IT'S HARD TO RELAX A LITTLE 
BIT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE WHEN IT IS ONE TO ZERO 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW ANYTHING COULD 
HAPPEN 
IF YOU DON'T WIN GAMES YOU HAPPEN WILL BE IN TROUBLE AND WE JUST HAVE 
NOT WON ENOUGH GAMES OR SCORED 
ENOUGH WHAT'S THE POINT IN GOING 
OVER AND OVER IT AND REHASHING WHAT 
HAS GONE ON BEFORE WE HAVE GOT 
EIGHT DAYS TO GET READY FOR 
ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST GAME IN OUR 
HISTORY WE ENJOY PLAYING IN THE 
PREMIERSHIP AND WE WANT TO STAY 
HERE CAN ONLY CONCENTRATE ON WHAT WE CAN DO IN EIGHT DAYS' TIME 
READING HAVE GOT TO FIND A GOAL 
FROM SOMEWHERE TO STAY UP HE TRIED 
SOMETHING TODAY BUT IT CLEARLY DID 
NOT WORK 
HE HAS HAD TO TRY 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AT TIMES WHAT 
THEY HAD WAS FIVE DEFENDERS FIVE 
ATTACKERS AND NOTHING IN THE MIDDLE 
YOU TALK ABOUT TOTTENHAM PLAYERS 
TIME AND SPACE BUT IF YOU GIVE 
THEM SPACE THEY WILL DESTROY YOU 
IT LOOKED LIKE TOTTENHAM WERE GOING 
TO SCORE ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT IT 
WAS LIKE A SCHOOLBOY GAME LET'S 
HAVE A LOOK AT THE READING BACK 
FOUR 
HAVE A LOOK AT THE READING BACK FOUR THIS SHOULD BE NO DANGER BUT 
WHEN IT IS FLICKED ON HE DOES 
INCREDIBLY WELL LOOK AT THE FIVE 
ARE READING PLAYERS ON THE FAR 
SIDE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE PICTURE 
YOU QUESTION THE DEFENSIVE 
ATTRIBUTES HERE THAT'S TERRIBLE 
BUT THE GREAT GOAL FROM ROBBIE 
KEANE THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING 
ABOUT A LACK OF MIDFIELD YOU 
CAN'T BELIEVE TEN SECONDS AFTER 
THIS WHERE IS THE MIDFIELD A OH 
HARAR IS RUNNING STILL ONE TO ZERO THIS 
IS LIKE TO THREE TO TWO AND THAT'S ONLY THE 
DEFENCE HE SHOULD HAVE SCORED 
THERE AND THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
FINISHED LONG BEFORE THIS ANYWAY 
THE LAST BUT WHERE PLAYERS WERE 
GETTING SUCKED INTO THE BALL THE 
SAME AGAIN JERMAINE JENAS HAS GOT 
SO MUCH TIME HERE THERE WAS NO 
CLOSING DOWN QUICKLY STEED 
MALBRANQUE GET IT BACK HERE FIVE 
OF THEM THERE IN A LINE THIS 
SHOULD END UP IN THE BACK OF THE 
NET A GREAT CHALLENGE HE AVERT 
DANGER THEY ARE IN THE BOTTOM 
THREE AND THEY NEED TO WIN AND GET 
GOALS FROM SOMEWHERE BUT YOU HAVE 
GOT TO DEFEND AS WELL IT'S ABOUT 
GETTING THE BALANCE RIGHT HE DOES 
NOT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AT 
THE MOMENT 
THEY DO PLAY DERBY 
THAT IS THE 
GOOD NEWS 
BOLTON WENT INTO THE 
KICK OFF KNOWN THAT A WIN AGAINST 
SUNDERLAND WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY 
SECURE BERKELEY'S PREMIER LEAGUE 
FOOTBALL NEXT SEASON THEY NO A GOAL WOULD ALMOST 
GUARANTEE SAFETY THE BANO 
JOHNNY EVANS IS FIT AGAIN IT HIT HIM HIGH ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE CHEST MAYBE A TOUCH OF THE SHOULDER BY NO 
PENALTY BOLTON HAVE HAD THE LION'S 
SHARE OF POSSESSION BEST SHOT OF THE GAME SO FAR IT COULD HAVE SEEN BOLTON ALMOST SAVED KEVIN DAVIES HAS THE BIG PHYSICAL 
MENACE BUT HE DOES NOT SCORE ENOUGH 
GOALS GOOD OPPORTUNITY KENWYNE JONES IS HUNGRY FOR GOALS 
HE HAS PROBABLY NOT SCORED AS MANY 
GOALS AS HIS PLAY HAS MERITED THIS 
SEASON JONES WAS IN THERE AND IT SEPTAL 
THROUGH ZIPPED ON THROUGH 
YOU SUPPORT A TEAM IN A RELEGATION 
PERIL IT IS AS PLEASANT AS 
LISTENING TO FINGERNAIL SCRAPED 
DOWN THE BLACKBOARD EL HADJI DIOUF ONE TO ZERO TO BOLTON 
WANDERERS HAS A FINISH OF REAL 
PRECISION THREE MINUTES BEFORE THE 
BREAK IT BRINGS A SMILE TO THE 
FACE OF GARY MEGSON IT COULD BE A 
FORTY MILLION GOAL WAS THE BALL IN THAT DAVIES OR WAS 
DIVISION ENOUGH TO SEE EL HADJI 
DIOUF THE DIVISION NOLAN WITH 
THE CROSS REAL COMPOSURE ABOUT EL 
HADJI DIOUF IT IS HIS SIXTH GOAL OF 
THE CAMPAIGN AND FIRST OF THE 
LEAGUE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IT COULD BE THE 
BIGGEST OF HIS BOLTON CAREER HOW DID THAT STAY OUT 
IT COULD HAVE WRAPPED THE GAME UP FOR BOLTON THEY WERE NOT ASSERTIVE ENOUGH WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SUNDERLAND IT COULD HAVE CHANGED THE WHOLE 
COMPLEXION OF THE RELEGATION RAT 
RACE CLEVER PLAY FROM READ THE BOUNCE TOOK IT AWAY FROM HIM IT WAS CLEVERLY SET UP FOR JONES IT IS ABLE TO AND THROW A IAN BOLTON THEY HAD ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO 
RAPID UP BUT COULD NOT TWIST ENOUGH 
EL HADJI DIOUF MAY BE LOST HIS 
BEARINGS HE SCORED THE GOAL THAT 
SEPARATES THE SIDES BUT HAS MISSED 
TWO MORE HE WENT TO BEND THE SHOT BUT IT 
SKIPPED AWAY OF THE DEFENDER 
FOREHEAD CORNER OFF THE DEFENDER 
FOR A CORNER HAS IT GONE IN THE ASSISTANT REFEREE HAS GIVEN IT BOLTON EDGE TOWARDS SAFETY IT WAS 
OVER THE LINE THEY TRIED TO KEEP 
IT OUT AN OWN GOAL BY DARYL MURPHY WITH 
EIGHT MINUTES TO GO GARY MEGSON IS 
SURELY EIGHT MINUTES AWAY FROM 
SAFETY TWENTY THOUSAND BOLTON FANS CELEBRATE THEY 
KNOW THAT BEYOND A FREAKISH SERIES 
OF LAST DAY RESULTS THEY ARE SAFE 
THEY HAVE WON THIS HUGE GAME BY TWO 
GOALS TO NIL 
YOU WERE BROUGHT HERE TO KEEP 
BOLTON AND IT LOOKS AS IF YOU HAVE 
DONE IT 
WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO IT 
TODAY WAS A GOOD DAY GIVEN THE 
AMOUNT OF PRESSURE THAT WAS AND 
EVERYBODY 
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT EVERYBODY THAT THERE SEEMED TO BE NO ROPE 
WHAT WAS THE CHANGE 
ANY COMING 
BACK IN WE JUST SAT THERE AND SAID 
DO WE WANT TO GO DOWN FIGHTING ORAL 
WIGAN TO LEAD THE SEASON PETER OUT 
AND GO DOWN OR ARE WE GOING TO 
LET 
THERE WAS A FLAG IN THE CROWD LET THAT SAID THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES 
THE WAY THAT HE WAVED TO THE CROWN 
SUGGESTS THAT SHE MAYBE GOING AWAY 
TO THE CROWD SUGGESTS YOU ARE 
MAYBE GOING AWAY 
I KNOW IN MY HEAD 
IT WAS MY LAST GAME FOR BOLTON AT 
THE REEBOK STADIUM THAT IS WHY I 
WANT TO LEAVE BOLTON WITH A GOOD 
TEAM 
WHAT WILL YOU DO IN THE LONG TEAM TERM TO TAKE THEM TO THE NEXT 
LEVEL 
WE HAVE TO KEEP IMPROVING LEVEL THE SQUAD KEEP IMPROVING THE 
QUALITY IN TERMS OF BRINGING 
CERTAIN 
PLAYERS IN ARE PLAYERS IN THIS CLUB THAT HAVE HAD 
ENOUGH CHANCES SOME OF THEM NEED 
MORE OF THEM 
YOU WOULD NEED AN 
ABACUS TO WORKOUT A MATHEMATICAL 
WAY OF AVOIDING RELEGATION BUT 
THEY HAVE DONE WELL 
THEY HAVE DONE 
A GREAT JOB GREAT TIME TO PLAY 
SUNDERLAND AFTER THEY SECURED THEIR 
PREMIERSHIP STATUS LAST WEEK 
BOLTON THOROUGHLY DESERVE TO WIN 
THEY CAUSED THEM PROBLEMS THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO TEAMS 
TODAY WAS EL HADJI DIOUF HE PLAYED 
REALLY WELL SHOULD HAVE HAD A HAT 
TRICK HE SCORED A VERY GOOD GOAL 
WHETHER YOU LOVE HIM OR LOATHE HIM 
HE HAS GOT ABILITY THIS IS WHAT HE 
CAN DO VERY GOOD FIRST TOUCH 
THAT GOT THEM OFF TO A GREAT START 
HE COULD HAVE HAD A HAT TRICK A 
DECENT BALL FROM MAIK TAYLOR HE 
SHOULD HAVE SCORED AND PUT THEM TWO 
UP DIFFICULT HEADER SHOULD HAVE 
HIT THE TARGET BUT WE HAVE HEARD 
IN SO THAT IS HIS LAST GAME HE 
SHOULD HAVE SCORED MORE GOALS BUT 
HE HAS GOT THE ABILITY HE HAS 
PULLED THEM OUT OF THEIR OLD TODAY 
AND GARY MEGSON DESERVES GREAT 
CREDIT OUT OF A HOLE HE HAS 
DONE REALLY WELL HE HAS HAD SOME 
LONG AND LONELY SATURDAY NIGHT BUT 
IT HAS ALL BEEN WORTHWHILE YOU YOU WERE NOT IMPRESSED WITH ANDY REID'S 
DEFENDING FROM THE CORNER THAT LED 
TO THE SECOND GOAL 
ROY KEANE WILL 
BE GOING MAD YOU PUT SOMEONE ON 
THE LINE BECAUSE THAT IS WHY YOU 
WANT THEM TO BE ANDY REID WAS NOT 
ON THE LINE HE WAS STANDING BEHIND 
IT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE LINE 
CLAIMING THE BALL AWAY HE RANG OUT 
TRYING TO PROTEST INNOCENCE A 
RAN OUT HE WAS A YARD BEHIND THE 
LINE 
I THINK WE CAN SEE WHERE THEY STOOD 
WHEN GARY MEGSON TO COVER IT IS 
REAL CONTRAST TO WHERE THEY WERE 
EARLY ON 
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAS 
THEY WERE ACTUALLY BELOW DERBY 
COUNTY WHEN THEY FIRST TOOK OVER 
HIS JOB WAS TO KEEP THEM IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE ANTI HAS DONE HIS 
JOB 
THERE WE GO 
IT WAS A JOB CONTROVERSIAL APPOINTMENT BUT NOT 
ANY MORE 
ONE OR TWO RAISED 
EYEBROWS WHEN HE TOOK OVER BUT YOU 
HAVE TO GIVE HIM CREDIT HE HAS 
DONE HIS JOB 
A TENSE DAY LIES AHEAD FOR THOSE OF 
US WITH CHAMPIONSHIP ISSUES WILL 
STOP ISSUES 
TWO SIDES WHO WERE LOOKING 
NERVOUSLY OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AND 
TWO TEAMS WHO HAD EUROPEAN 
AMBITIONS SHORTLY WE WILL SEE 
ASTON VILLA FACE WIGAN BUT FIRST IT 
IS MIDDLESBROUGH AGAINST PORTSMOUTH CHRIS RIGGOTT HAD EXPECTED TO BE IN 
THE STOKE SIDE TRYING TO GET OUT OF 
THE JANGLING SHIP TOMORROW INSTEAD 
HE HAS BEEN RECALLED BY IT GARETH 
SOUTHGATE AS MIDDLESBROUGH TRY TO 
GET PREMIERSHIP SURVIVAL BY 
GARETH SOUTHGATE THERE IS A 
WEMBLEY WORKOUT FOR MILAN BAROS 
STILL LOOKING FOR HIS FIRST GOAL IN 
A PORTSMOUTH SHIRT PORTSMOUTH ARE PLAYING WITH THE 
FREEDOM OF SIDE THAT ARE WELL SAVED TOP HALF OF THE LEAGUE GARETH SOUTHGATE HAS NOT SEEN HIS SIDE WIN FOR SIX WEEKS NOW THE LAD PLAY BY TUNCAY ALERT PLAY GREAT CHANCE AGAIN AND WHAT 
A WASTE AGAIN IF HARRY REDKNAPP IS USING THIS AS A CHANCE TO CHECK OUT MILAN BAROS'S 
WEMBLEY'S SUITABILITY HE IS 
FAILING THE TEST AT THE MOMENT WELL THAT WAS A POWERFUL SURGING 
RUN BY THE BRAZILIAN THAT WAS NOT 
FAR WIDE ANOTHER CORNER MIDDLESBROUGH TAKE THE LEAD AND A 
MAN BROUGHT BACK FROM HIS LOAN 
SPELL WITH STOKE CITY CELEBRATES 
WITH HIS FIRST GOAL FOR 
MIDDLESBROUGH IN TWO YEARS NO 
WONDER HE IS SMILING CHRIS RIGGOTT 
NET THAT FLASH ON THE FOREHEAD ASHDOWN IS GIVEN NO CHANCE AT ALL HERMANN HREIDARSSON FOR ANOTHER MIDDLESBROUGH CORNER TROUBLED A LONG WAY ALL THE WAY IN BY TEN HIGH THERE IS CLEAR DAYLIGHT BETWEEN 
THEMSELVES AND PORTSMOUTH 
MIDDLESBROUGH EDGED CLOSER TO THE 
THREE POINTS WHICH WILL INSURE 
THEIR PREMIER LEAGUE SURVIVAL IF 
IT WAS NEVER IN ANY DOUBT FROM 
INSIDE THE SIX YARD BOX THE TURK 
COULD NOT MISS MIDDLESBROUGH ON 
COURSE FOR THE BEST VICTORY SINCE 
SEPTEMBER THE BEST CHANCE PORTSMOUTH HAS HAD 
SINCE MILAN BAROS MISSED IN THE 
FIRST HALF YOU FANCY HIM TO KILL 
THIS BEYOND SHORTS OR BE ON THE FAR 
POST BUT HE GOT IT WRONG MARK 
SCHWARTZ A JULIA LOCK FABIO RUSSIAN BACK STUART DOWNING KNOWS THAT WAS A BAD 
BAD MISS THE WHOLE GOAL TO AIM FOR 
AND STUART DOWNING STRUCK IT 
STRAIGHT UP THE GOALKEEPER FOR THE 
FIRST TIME THIS SEASON 
MIDDLESBROUGH SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
FINDING THE NET FOR THE THIRD TIME 
EVERYONE HAD BEEN TELLING US FOR 
WEEKS WE ARE SAFE BUT WHY YOU'RE 
INVOLVED IN IT YOU NEVER GET 
CHANCE TO SWITCH OFF SO IT'S A 
MASSIVE IMPORTANT RESULT FOR US 
NOT THE BEST GAME BUT WE DID ENOUGH 
TO WIN IT 
WE HAD ONE OR TWO 
OPPORTUNITIES BUT THEN THEY SCORED 
FROM A SET PLAY WE HADN'T MARKED 
AT I TALKED ABOUT AT HALF TIME 
THEN WE CAME OUT IN THE SECOND HALF 
AND DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING 
AGAIN IT WAS DISAPPOINTING WHEN WHEN THEY SEE TEAMS MAKING GAPS YOU 
START TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT CAN 
HAPPEN WE HAVE LEARNED ENORMOUS 
LESSONS THIS YEAR AS A GROUP AND 
WE HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH A LOT WE 
HAD FOUR OR FIVE PLAYERS MISSING 
WE DID JUST ENOUGH TO STAY IN IT IS DEFINITELY A VILLA PARK A 
FAREWELL FOR A LOT MAIL BOAT HIS 
FINAL MATCH BEFORE MOVING TO 
JUVENTUS A LOT MUHL BURKE OLAF ASTON VILLA CAN BUILD HERE A REAL 
WAR OF EXPECTATION FROM THE HOME 
SUPPORTERS A FINAL WARNING FROM THE REFEREE TO THE WIGAN DEFENDER MACRO NIGHT THAT TONIGHT WITH HEADER THE TALL DEFENDER GETTING UP I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S THAT PASS WAS 
ABOUT IT IS A CORNER KICK WAS 
THAT GOAL BACK TOWARDS HIS OWN 
GOAL THAT'S THE QUESTION STEVE 
BRUCE IS POSING AS WELL GABRIEL AGBONLAHOR JUST OVER JASON KOUMAS IS THE MOST RELIEVED 
MAN IN THE APART GABRIEL 
AGBONLAHOR WITH THE HEADER JUST 
PUSHED ONTO THE BAR BY CHRIS 
KIRKLAND BARRY CHRIS KIRKLAND WAS UNDER SOME 
PRESSURE THERE IT LOOKED TO BE A 
REGULATION CATCH AT FIRST BUT THEN 
HE REALISED IT WASN'T IT TAKES A DEFLECTION AND IT IS IN 
VALENCIA OR PUT WIGAN IN FRONT 
ARE STAYING UP SAYS THE BANNER 
VALENCIA'S GOAL IT MAY WELL ENSURE 
THAT THAT IS THE CASE NOT TOO MUCH 
ON HERE FOR VALENCIA IT TAKES A 
HUGE DEFLECTION OFF WELL FOR BOOMER IT JUST LOOPS INTO THE GOAL HOW 
WILL MARTIN O'NEILL'S SIDE REACTED 
TO GOING A GOAL DOWN ONLY JUST WIDE GARETH BARRY 
HITTING IT A RIGHT FOOTED AND IT 
JUST STROKES THE OUTSIDE OF THE NET 
THERE WERE MANY AMONGST THE HOME 
SUPPORT TO THOUGHT THAT HAD GONE IN VALENCIA COULD HE BE ON FOR A SECOND HE 
HAS WHAT AN AFTERNOON FOR WIGAN 
AND WHAT AN AFTERNOON FOR VALENCIA 
THEY SURELY CAME HERE MORE IN HOPE 
THAN EXPECTATION BUT TWO GOALS 
FROM THE ECUADOR INTERNATIONAL AND 
WIGAN LEAD UEFA CUP CHASING ASTON 
VILLA BY TWO TO ZERO SUDDENLY VALENCIA WAS AWAY DESPITE 
THE GOALKEEPER'S BEST EFFORTS 
EXCELLENT FINISH GABRIEL AGBONLAHOR WHAT A SAVE 
FROM CHRIS KIRKLAND IT WAS GOING 
TO LOOP IN UNTIL HIS INTERVENTION THREE AGAINST THREE AT THE MOMENT THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES A HUGELY IMPORTANT WIN FOR STEVE 
BRUCE AND WIGAN ATHLETIC IT 
GUARANTEES THEM A PLACE IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE NEXT SEASON THREE 
POINTS FROM VILLA PARK TAKES SOME 
UP TO FORTY FOUR THE SEASON AND THAT IS 
SAFETY 
I HAVE NOT DONE THAT MUCH IN 
MANAGEMENT TO BE HONEST BUT IN 
MID DECEMBER GOING INTO THE 
BLACKBURN GAME WE NEEDED TO GET FORTY 
POINTS IT'S FANTASTIC FOR THE 
PLAYERS AND OBVIOUSLY I'M DELIGHTED 
THAT WE HAVE MANAGED TO DO IT IT'S IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN REALLY HOW WE 
PLAYED SO FLAT FOR SO LONG IT'S 
VERY DISAPPOINTING IT WAS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO PUT PRESSURE ON 
EVERTON 
HOW DISAPPOINTING WAS EVERTON TODAY

AFTER THE GAME L. SAW MY NAME ALL

COMFORTABLY AT THE BOTTOM UP THE 
TABLE BOTTLE OF THE TABLE 
BOTTLE OF IF GARBER LOSE THEY ARE THE WORST 
TEAM EVER IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
IF DERBY LOSE MILES ANDERSON'S APPEARANCE IS A 
REWARD FOR HIS FALL IN THE RESERVES 
HIS FORM THE ATTEMPTED CLEARANCE BY BRAD 
FRIEDEL IT COULD SO EASILY HAVE 
DROPPED IN THAT WAS A GREAT DELIVERY AND A 
GOOD CLEARING HEADER BY THE 
YOUNGSTER THAT IS A TERRIFIC BIT OF FOOTBALL 
IT WAS A HUGE KICK DOWNFIELD BY ROY 
CARROLL AND SHE CAME FROM RIGHT ON 
THE HALFWAY LINE KENNY MILLER 
HE CAME THE APPEALS FOR OFFSIDE 
WERE FUTILE THE DEFENDERS DID NOT 
KNOW WHERE TO TURN THAT IS A SHARP 
BIT OF PLAY BY THE SCOTTISH 
INTERNATIONAL WOULD IT BE INAPPROPRIATE TO SAY 
THAT WAS ALMOST A DAVID BECKHAM BIT 
OF SKILL IF STEPHEN WARNOCK HAD NOT BLOCKED 
IT DERBY MIGHT HAVE LED TO ZERO AT 
HALF TIME TWO TO ZERO THE 
EUROPEAN AMBITIONS ARE FADING FAST 
AS THE HALF COMES TO CLOSE SANTA CRUZ 
WHAT A GOAL FOR DERBY WHAT A BLOW FOR DERBY COUNTY SANTA CRUZ'S TWENTY SECOND GOAL OF THE SEASON WELL I AM TEMPTED TO SAY WHAT A PITY JASON ROBERTS FOUND HIMSELF WITH 
TIME AND SPACE AND THE INVITATION 
WAS 
TO GOOD TO TURN DOWN TO GOOD ON CURRENT FORM DERBY WOULD HAVE TO PLAY FOR THREE AND A HALF SEASONS TO GET FORTY POINTS ROY CARROLL SCRAMBLED TO PREVENT 
WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DELICIOUS 
GOAL JASON ROBERTS IS SUCH A 
PHYSICAL PRESENCE HE APPLAUDS THE PASS BUT HE SHOULD HAVE SCORED SANTA CRUZ WAS THERE BUT HE IS 
TANGLED UP IN THE BACK OF THE NET 
THAT MAKES IT TWENTY THREE OUT FOR THE SEASON 
TWENTY THREE NOW BLACKBURN HAVE PASSED THE 
SECOND HALF DOMINATED THE SECOND 
HALF 
IT WAS BUT PLAY FROM OUR HALF POINT OF VIEW THEY DESERVED IT ON 
OUR FIRST HALF PERFORMANCE BUT 
PLATE THE SECOND HALF SO WE CAME 
OUT WITH A LOT MORE DRIVE AND 
PURPOSE AND AS A CONSEQUENCE WE 
SAW THE GAME OUT 
WE HAVE BEEN 
EXPOSED IN THIS LEAGUE DEFENSIVELY 
WE HAVE MADE MISTAKES AND IT HAS 
COST US A GOAL MAYBE AT THE AREAS 
ALMOST SOMETHING ABOUT THIS YOU 
CAN MAKE A MISTAKE IN THIS LEAGUE 
AND TWO IT WILL COST YOU AND IT 
WILL COST YOU 
ONE WEEK TO GO AND MANCHESTER 
UNITED ARE THREE POINTS AWAY FROM 
DEFENDING THEIR TITLE FORMALITY 
THE WAY THIS SEASON HAS GONE I 
DOUBT IT AND 
THEY BELIEVE A DEAD MAN'S SPIRIT CAN COME AFTER THEM FROM THE GRAVE 
IT'S ME YOU'RE TALKING TO GRACE IT'S ME 
SOMETHING HORRIBLE'S HAPPENED HERE 
AGH YOU ALL RIGHT 
BLOOD WAS FOUND ON A SHAWL THAT WAS AT THIS GRAVE O. K. 
HATRED DOESN'T BIND IT EATS AWAY IT DESTROYS LISTEN TO THIS 
SIR
