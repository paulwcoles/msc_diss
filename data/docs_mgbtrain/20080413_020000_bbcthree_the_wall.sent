COUPLE OF WEIRD ONES BUT MOSTLY REALLY NICE 
JONATHAN I'M GONNA BE HONEST 
COOL WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY WRITTEN ANY QUESTIONS FOR THIS INTERVIEW 
IT'S NOT US BEING LAZY NO WE HAD A BETTER IDEA 
WE JUST THOUGHT WE'D TAPE SOME QUESTIONS OFF THE TELLY 
HERE'S OUR FIRST ONE I FOUND THIS FROM JOHN CRAVEN ON COUNTRYFILE 
WHAT KIND OF BIRDS ARE BEST AND HOW DO YOU MAKE YOUR CHICKENS FEEL AT HOME 
YES JOHN CRAVEN WHAT KIND OF BIRDS ARE BEST 
AND HOW DO YOU MAKE THE CHICKENS FEEL AT HOME I'M SO TIRED OF ANSWERING THAT QUESTION 
DO YOU KEEP ANY ANIMALS YES WE KEEP LOADS OF ANIMALS 
WE'VE GOT FIVE DOGS AND ONE OF THEM HAS HAD FOUR LITTLE PUPPIES AWW 
AWW LITTLE ONES THAT MEANS YOU'VE GOT NINE DOGS WE'RE NOT GOING TO KEEP ALL NINE 
ARE YOU GOING TO PUT THEM IN A SACK I'M GOING TO KILL THREE OF THEM YEAH 
I CAME HERE TO TELL EVERYONE 
SERIOUSLY ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO NO I'M NOT REALLY 
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ONE OF THEM AND GIVE THE OTHER THREE AWAY 
HOW WILL YOU DECIDE WHICH ONE MY DAUGHTER'S CHOSEN ONE 
A LITTLE SOFT BROWN ONE CALLED CUPCAKE A W. W. W. 
AND THE OTHER ONES ARE CALLED SHIT PISS AND WANK SO 
I THINK CUPCAKE'S WINNING ALREADY 
ARE THEY WELL TRAINED NOT THE PUPPIES NO BUT THE OTHERS ARE REASONABLY WELL TRAINED 
ALTHOUGH ONE OF THEM MY DOG I THINK HE'S ANGRY 
ONE OF THE DOGS IS ALLOWED TO SLEEP IN OUR BED BETWEEN ME AND MY WIFE ON A REGULAR BASIS 
AND ON THE OCCASIONS WHEN WE HAVE INTERCOURSE WE'RE A MARRIED COUPLE NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT 
SOMETIMES I HAVE TO NUDGE HIM OUT TO ONE SIDE 
ONCE WHEN WE HAD SEX HE JOINED IN HE STARTED LICKING MY BALLS 
AND I'LL STAND UP TO DEMONSTRATE THIS IF I MAY 
THE THING IS PLEASE DO BE THE DOG I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW YOU ALL THE TECHNIQUES 
YOU WERE LASSOOING YOUR WIFE I WON'T GIVE AWAY ALL MY BEDROOM SECRETS 
THAT'S ON THE D. V. D. NO SO I'M LYING ON TOP OF HER LIE DOWN RHYS 
O. K. I'M YOU YOU'RE THE LADY O. K. 
SO I'M UP HERE 
THIS IS LIKE WHERE'S THE DOG A HORRID NIGHTMARE 
SO I'M GOING LIKE THIS AND THEN I FEEL THE DOG AND 
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY THERE'S A DOG LICKING MY BALLS IN CASE SHE SAID GET OFF THAT WAS ME 
SO I STARTED TRYING TO SHAKE IT OFF LIKE THAT RIGHT 
I COULD SEE HER THINKING HE'S BEEN WATCHING PORN OR SOMETHING 
SHE WENT WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
I WENT DOG'S LICKING MY BALLS SHE SAID GET OFF 
DO YOU KNOW IF A DOG LOCKS ITS JAW WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO 
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE HAVING GET OFF HE'S WAITING FOR MORE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MEANT TO DO IF A DOG LOCKS ITS JAW ON WHERE 
IF A DOG BITES YOU THIS IS A FACT FOR ALL OF YOU AT HOME 
IF A DOG BITES YOU AND IT LOCKS ITS JAW 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PUT YOUR FINGER UP ITS ARSE 
IS THAT WHAT YOU TOLD THE POLICE WHEN THEY BROKE IN ON YOU 
TRUE STORY I'M NOT BEING RUDE I'M JUST TELLING PEOPLE AS A FACT 
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER QUESTION NOW 
WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM JESUS AH 
DO YOU LOVE ME 
DO YOU LOVE HIM DO YOU LOVE JESUS 
WELL IT'S HARD TO SAY NO REALLY I SUPPOSE I LOVE JESUS 
I'M NOT REALLY A RELIGIOUS PERSON BUT AS BELIEF SYSTEMS GO 
THE CHRISTIAN ONE SEEMS PARTICULARLY CHARMING 
FROM A FASHION PERSPECTIVE IF YOU WERE TO PICK A RELIGION 
WHO WOULD YOU GO FOR I WOULD GO FOR SHINTOISM 
O. K. WHAT'S THAT THAT'S THE OTHER POPULAR ONE IN JAPAN 
THERE'S BUDDHISM AND SHINTOISM SHINTOISM IS THE NO FUCKING AROUND VERSION OF BUDDHISM 
THEY'RE KIND OF MISERABLE TOUGH A BIT MEAN DON'T GIVE YOU MUCH TIME OFF 
DO THEY WEAR GOOD OUTFITS THEY WEAR REALLY COOL ROBES 
SO I'D BE A SHINTOIST O. K. 
IF YOU WERE JESUS WHO WOULD BE YOUR DISCIPLES 
WHO WOULD BE MY DISCIPLES YEAH LIKE JIMMY CARR DAVID WALLIAMS 
IT FUCKING WOULDN'T BE JIMMY CARR JIMMY CARR WOULD BE JUDAS 
HE'S GONNA BETRAY YOU HE'D SELL YOU OUT FOR A CORPORATE FEE 
O. K. WE'VE GOT ANOTHER QUESTION IT'S FROM NICKY CAMPBELL OH LOVELY 
IS IT A SIN TO BE RICH 
SLOWEST ASKED QUESTION IN THE WORLD IS IT A SIN TO BE RICH 
I THINK THAT'S THE FACE HE MAKES WHEN HE COMES 
WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS 
IS IT A SIN TO BE RICH NO FROM WHERE I'M SITTING A POSITION OF COMPARATIVE WEALTH NO 
I LOVE BEING WEALTHY 
I TELL YOU WHAT IT'S GREAT 
IS IT TRUE YOU'RE WORTH A HUNDRED BILLION TRILLION 
THAT'S A VERY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE 
JONATHAN JUST TO CLARIFY IN MY MIND I'D LIKE TO WORK OUT HOW RICH YOU ARE 
I'VE WRITTEN A CHECKLIST O. K. O. K. COULD YOU HAVE SOMEONE KILLED 
ER I DON'T KNOW WHETHER COULD IS THE ANSWER 
WOULD MIGHT BE MORE 
NO IF I WANTED TO HAVE SOMEONE KILLED I WOULDN'T WANT TO FARM OUT THE SATISFACTION OF DOING IT 
I'D WANT TO BE THERE AND CHOKE THE VERY LIFE FROM THEIR BODY 
THAT'S A BIT DARK DO YOU OWN A PLANE DO I OWN A PLANE 
NO I DON'T OWN A PLANE WELL I'VE GOT SOME TOY PLANES 
A PROPER PLANE PEOPLE COULD RIDE ON OR IN NO THIS IS MY OTHER FAVOURITE FOLLY 
HAVE YOU GOT A BOUNCY CASTLE IN YOUR GARDEN

O. K. I HAD THEM BUILT FOR THE CHILDREN TO PLAY IN DO THEY PLAY IN THEM DO THEY FUCK 
I'M HOPING TO HIRE THEM OUT TO MIGRANT WORKERS 
WHEN YOU EJACULATE DOES OIL COME OUT 
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW EH 
HERE'S THE NEXT QUESTION SOMETHING VERY PERTINENT FROM ANDREW NEIL 
GOOD ONE WHAT DO YOU THINK TO THAT QUESTION HE'S AN ODD LOOKING BLOKE LOOK AT HIS HAIR 
YOU'D THINK THEY COULD DO SOMETHING WITH SOME PART OF THAT 
YOU MIGHT END UP LIKE THAT I'M GOING A BIT THAT WAY 
IF I DO START LOOKING LIKE THAT I'VE PROMISED MY WIFE I WILL CUT OFF MY OWN FUCKING HEAD 
HE LOOKS LIKE A GROTESQUE GARGOYLE 
DO YOU SPEAK ANY OTHER LANGUAGES NOT VERY WELL I SPEAK A BIT OF FRENCH YEAH 
I CAN SPEAK A TINY BIT OF ITALIAN I'M LEARNING JAPANESE BUT I'M NOWHERE NEAR FLUENT IN IT WOW 
CAN YOU SAY ANYTHING OFFENSIVE IN JAPANESE
