I'M JOHNNY KINGDOM AND I LOVE FILMING THE WILDLIFE ON EXMOOR WHERE I HAVE LIVED ALL MY LIFE 
COME ON 
LAST YEAR I BOUGHT MY OWN PIECE OF LAND FIFTY ACRES OF WOOD AND FIELDS 
AND I AM HAVING A LOVELY TIME MAKING IT A SAFE PLACE FOR THE ANIMALS 
DO YOU WANT TO COME OUT 
BUT I'VE HARDLY BEEN DOWN TO MY LAND THESE LAST FEW WEEKS 
BECAUSE NOW THAT SPRING'S HERE THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO AROUND EXMOOR 
AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR THERE'S A LOT I WANT TO SHOW YOU 
THIS WEEK I GET CLOSER TO A FAMILY OF FOXES THAN I'VE EVER DONE BEFORE 
KEEP STILL WHEREVER YOU BE KEEP STILL 
SHE'S BOUND TO SMELL US 
AND I GO BACK TO SEE HOW THOSE BADGER CUBS I MET A FEW WEEKS AGO ARE GETTING ON 
D'YOU KNOW I'M JOHNNY I'M FROM EXMOOR YEAH 
IT'S SPRINGTIME 
AND MY VILLAGE OF BISHOP'S NYMPTON 
ALWAYS LOOKS LOVELY THIS TIME OF THE YEAR 
EVERYTHING IS COMING TO LIFE 
SO I'M NOT ONLY BUSY FILMING ON MY LAND 
BUT I'M ALSO FINDING LOTS TO LOOK AT IN MY BACK GARDEN 
RIGHT JUST LOOK AT THE SCREEN WHEN IT COMES ON 
NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS 
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT THAT'S A JACKDAW'S NEST 
NOW I HAVE NEVER FILMED INSIDE A JACKDAW'S NEST BEFORE 
DO YOU KNOW A JACKDAW HAS BUILT IN MY DOVE HOUSE 
ABOVE MY MISSUS'S ROUNDHOUSE 
THE JACKDAW IS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE CROW FAMILY 
THAT NEST AROUND BUILDINGS AS WELL AS TREES 
THIS YEAR A COLONY OF JACKDAWS HAS MOVED INTO OUR ROAD AND NESTED IN EVERYONE'S CHIMNEYS 
BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH CHIMNEYS SO ONE PAIR HAS COME TO MY DOVE HOUSE 
AND HONESTLY FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS I'VE HAD SOME LAUGHS I'M HAVING GREAT FUN 
JUST SEE THAT WIDE SHOT HE'S ON HIS WAY DOWN 
NOW LOOK WATCH THIS OH HE'S GOT TWO OR THREE STICKS TOGETHER HOW'S HE GOING TO GET THAT IN 
HE'S GOT IN WONDERFUL EH HE'S PUT SOMETHING IN RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA WHICH ISN'T SO CLEVER 
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A LAMB'S TAIL BUT THEY BRING ALL SORTS OF STUFF IN 
A JACKDAW WILL PICK UP ANYTHING SHINY ANYTHING AT ALL 
HE'LL EVEN PICK UP A RING IF HE'VE SEEN IM 
HE'S THAT SORT OF BIRD 
NOW HE'S GOT A VERY LONG STICK 
NOW THIS IS GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE 
YOU CAN'T GO THAT WAY MATE 
YOU CAN'T GO THAT WAY HE'S STEPPED ON IT LOOK LEFT'M OUTSIDE 
MY MISSUS'S WASHING MACHINE'S ON BEHIND ME 
JOHN'S BEEN OUT THERE FOR WEEKS ON AND OFF 
WE'RE AFRAID TO OPEN THE DOOR IN CASE WE MAKE A NOISE 
SO IT'S BEEN A BIT OF A PAIN REALLY 
HE BROUGHT THE STICK OUT AGAIN LOOK FOR SOME REASON WHICH HE COULDN'T GET IN 
HE DOESN'T KNOW HE'S DOING THAT BIRD 
NOW HE'S GONE BACK IN AGAIN WITH THE SAME STICK 
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE NO IT DON'T MAKE SENSE 
HERE YOU ARE WHERE SHALL I PUT IT 
OH PUT IT DOWN THERE THAT'LL BE O. K. 
I'LL HAVE IT IN A MINUTE TA 
HE TELLS US WHAT'S GOING ON AND LETS US KNOW THE PROGRESS EACH TIME 
BUT IT SEEMS TO BE GOING ON FOREVER 
WHAT ON EARTH'S HE DOING 
HE'S DOING SOME STRAIGHTENING UP INSIDE 
I'LL GO INSIDE AGAIN I'M MISSING SOME NICE SHOTS 
CUCKOO 
OH HE'S TOSSING THIS CORNER I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO DO THAT 
OH HE'S DETERMINED TO BLOCK ME RIGHT OFF 
OH NOW COME ON BIRDIE 
HE WON'T HE'S GOING TO PUT THAT 
HE'S GOING TO BLOCK ME OFF HE'S DONE IT 
THE LITTLE SOD THAT'S SPOILED MY VIEWING NOW 
THEY'RE SO SMART THOSE BIRDS 
WELL THAT'S PUT AN END TO MY FUN 
I KNOW WHEN I'M NOT WANTED 
STILL IT'S A LOVELY DAY AND I'VE GOT PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS TO DO 
FIRST OF ALL I'M GOING BACK TO SOMERSET TO SEE HOW THOSE BADGER CUBS ARE GETTING ON 
THESE THREE LITTLE CUBS HAVE BEEN FOUND ABANDONED ON A BUILDING SITE 
AND BROUGHT INTO THE ANIMAL SANCTUARY 
WHEN I MET THEM THEY WERE LIVING IN THE KITCHEN OF PAULINE KIDNER THE SANCTUARY OWNER 
NOW I'VE COME BACK TO SEE HER AND THE CUBS AS THEY SAY GOODBYE TO HER KITCHEN 
AND GO ON THE NEXT STAGE OF THEIR JOURNEY BACK INTO THE WILD 
SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN YES 
I'M BACK TO SEE MY FRIENDS NICE TO SEE YOU 
YOU'LL BE SURPRISED JUST HOW MUCH THEY'VE GROWN AND YOU 
THESE ARE THE GUYS YOU HAD IN YOUR HANDS OH GEE LOOK AT THAT 
UNBELIEVABLE THERE WE GO 
THEY'VE GROWED FAST HAVEN'T THEY JUST HELLO MY FRIEND OH WELL NOW LOOK AT THAT EH 
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL HELLO MATE 
HAVE A LITTLE SNIFF OF JOHNNY DON'T TAKE A PIECE OUT OF MY HAND BUT OH THEM BEAUTIFUL 
THIS IS WONDERFUL TO HOLD THIS BADGER YOU KNOW LOVELY 
D'YOU KNOW I'M JOHNNY I'M FROM EXMOOR YEAH 
I'VE COME A LONG WAYS TO SEE YOU YEAH 
WELL TODAY THE CUBS ARE BEING MOVED TO A NEW PEN 
YOU'VE GOT A FAIR NIP YOU'VE GOT A FAIR NIP ON YOU 
YOU'VE GOT MY FINGER YEAH 
BUT BEFORE THEY GO THEY MUST BE GIVEN A BLOOD TEST 
BECAUSE THERE IS A RISK THAT THE BADGERS CAN PASS T. B. TO CATTLE 
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX SITUATION THE T. B. 
BADGERS DO CARRY BOVINE T. B. IN VERY VERY SMALL NUMBERS SO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM THREE BLOOD TESTS 
THE IDEA IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE IN RELEASING OF BADGERS BACK INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE 
OH SO THIS IS WHERE IT ALL HAPPENS 
WE'RE GOING TO USE THE GASSING CHAMBER 
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO YOUNG WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM INJECTABLE ANAESTHETIC 
SO LISA'S GOING TO GAS THEM DOWN WE WANT THEM TO BE NICE AND STILL WHEN IT COMES TO BLOOD TESTING 
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO POP A TOWEL OVER HIM AS WELL 
SO THAT IT WILL STOP HIM SEEING OUT AND HE'LL START TO QUIETEN DOWN 
THERE'S A GOOD BOY AS SOON AS THEY FEEL SAFER BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN'T SEE THEM 
THEN YOU SLOW DOWN THE STRESS OF ANY SITUATION THAT THEY MIGHT BE IN 
THE TRIPLE BLOOD TEST MAKES REALLY SURE THAT THE BADGERS HAVEN'T GOT THE DISEASE 
BUT IF ANY OF THESE CUBS HAVE GOT T. B. THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE PUT DOWN 
THERE'S A GOOD BOY 
BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO WAKE THIS LITTLE BADGER UP 
WHAT'S THAT FUNNY NOISE SNORING AHH 
OH AIN'T THAT MARVELLOUS 
THIS IS WHERE THEY WANT REASSURANCE YEAH O. K. 
D'YOU WANT THAT ONE FOR ME O. K. 
SO NOW YOU GO TO PAULINE TAKES IT NOW 
AND PAULINE WILL BRING IT AROUND OH LOOK AT THAT 
YOU'RE DOING A WONDERFUL JOB YOU KNOW AND IT'S NICE FOR ME 
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH YOU DO THIS BECAUSE I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS DONE BEFORE NO 
IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO WORK WITH THESE ANIMALS BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE RELEASING THEM 
WE'D MUCH PREFER TO SEE THEM IN THE WILD THAN BEING WITH US 
AND LETTING THE CAGE OPEN AT THE END IS JUST THE MOST FANTASTIC THING VERY REWARDING 
OBVIOUSLY YOU DO GET ATTACHED AND YOU DO GET ONES THAT YOU'RE VERY ATTACHED TO 
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT IF YOU LOVE THEM YOU'LL LET THEM GO 
THE CUBS ARE BEING TAKEN TO THEIR NEW PEN TO JOIN OTHER BADGERS 
SO THIS IS THE NEXT STAGE THAT'S RIGHT 
AH I SEE THEM OVER THERE AHH THERE YOU ARE 
THEY'LL GO IN WITH THEIR NEW FRIENDS SO IF YOU WOULD DO THE HONOURS O. K. AH THERE YOU ARE 
IT'S ALL OVER ALL OVER ONE MORE STAGE AFTER THIS IS IT 
THAT'S IT THERE YOU ARE SOME FRIENDS 
WHAT'S THAT 
THERE SNIFF THEM 
SO WE'VE GOT A NICE GROUP OF SEVEN HERE 
AND THEY'LL STAY TOGETHER 
THEY WILL LOOK TO EACH OTHER FOR SECURITY AND QUICKLY REVERT 
BOYS NOW STEADY 
WELL IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL AND I'LL BE BACK LATER ON IN THE YEAR 
HOPEFULLY TO SEE THESE BADGERS BIGGER THAN EVER GO BACK INTO THE WILD GOD BLESS YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'VE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB 
TAKE CARE WONDERFUL JOB BYE 
WELL PAULINE WILL LET ME KNOW WHEN THE TEST RESULTS COME THROUGH 
COME ON YOU DOWN HERE THERE'S A GOOD BADGER 
MAY IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE TIMES OF THE YEAR 
THE WOODS LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE IT'S BLUEBELL TIME 
THIS IS THE TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN THE FOX CUBS FIRST COME OUT 
AND TODAY IS A GOOD DAY FOR STALKING THEM BECAUSE THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH WIND ABOUT TO CARRY MY SCENT 
SO I'M OFF TO WHERE I KNOW THERE IS A FOX'S DEN JUST UP THE ROAD FROM MY LAND 
WELL I DON'T SEE NO FOX CUBS YET 
BUT I CAN SEE ALL THE GROUND WHERE IT'S ALL BATTERED DOWN SO THAT'S A SIGN THERE'S CUBS THERE 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TRY AND GO A BIT CLOSER 
AND JUST SIT DOWN AND WAIT AND SEE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS O. K. 
YES I CAN SEE SOMETHING NOW 
LITTLE TINY CUB UP THERE ABOVE THE HOLES VERY VERY SMALL 
LIKE LITTLE KITTENS YOU SEE NOT VERY BIG AT ALL 
THEY MUST HAVE ONLY JUST COME OUT OF THE GROUND 
THE VIXEN JUST COME BACK WITH SOMETHING IN HER MOUTH 
OH THERE'S ONE CUB THERE 
DON'T LOOK TOO GOOD AT ALL THAT ONE 
VERY FRAIL 
THAT CUB'S VERY VERY ILL HE'LL NEVER MAKE IT 
I DON'T THINK THAT LITTLE CUB IS GETTING HIS SHARE OF FOOD 
BUT THAT'S NATURE 
ONLY HALF THE FOX CUBS ARE BORN SURVIVE EACH YEAR ANYWAY 
KEEP STILL WHEREVER YOU BE KEEP STILL 
SHE'S BOUND TO SMELL US 
SHE'S GONE AWAY 
DAMN 
BUT NOW I'M SO CLOSE TO THE DEN THERE'S NO CUBS TO BE SEEN 
I'M COMING BACK I'M COMING BACK 
WELL I ENJOYED THAT I'M TELLING YOU AND I DEFINITELY GOT ONE SHOT 
OF HER ACTUALLY GIVING THE FOOD TO THE CUBS 
BUT THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE LAST SHOT THE VIXEN MUST HAVE SMELT ME COS SHE WENT 
AND BOLTED SO I'M GIVING UP 
BUT I'LL BE BACK BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MISS SHOTS LIKE THAT IT'S WONDERFUL 
RIGHT NOW I'M JUST GOING TO POP UP TO MY LAND 
I PUT UP A TAWNY OWL NESTING BOX IN JANUARY AND IT'S NOW TIME TO CHECK IT 
RIGHT I'LL JUST TURN ON THIS V. C. R. 
PRESS THIS AND THIS 
AW WHAT A SHAME NO LUCK WELL THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE I'M DISAPPOINTED 
BUT I NEVER GET IT RIGHT DO I YOU KNOW 
WELL NOW IT'S UP I'M SURE I'LL DO BETTER NEXT YEAR 
BUT I WOULDN'T MIND GETTING A BIT MORE ADVICE ON IT 
I THINK I'LL GO AND SEE KEVIN 
WHO I MET IN THE WINTER BADGER WATCHING 
HE'S HAD A TAWNY OWL BOX UP FOR SIX YEARS AND HAS HAD CHICKS IN NEARLY EVERY YEAR 
SO HE MUST BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT 
IS THAT YOU KEVIN 
OH YEAH COME IN COME IN ALL RIGHT MATE NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN KEV 
I'VE BEEN HERE QUITE A LONG TIME AND THERE'S NOTHING HAPPENING BUT JUST SO NICE TO SEE 'EM LIKE THAT 
THEIR FUNNY FACES AND THAT BUT AS THEY GET OLDER AND OLDER THEY GET PRETTIER THAN EVER 
HOW OLD ARE THEY THE FIRST ONE WAS BORN ABOUT SIXTH APRIL 
AND THE FEMALE LAYS THE EGGS AT TWO DAY INTERVALS 
THAT'S THE OWL'S SURVIVAL TECHNIQUE BECAUSE EVEN FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE 
THE OLDEST ONE WILL RUSH FORWARD STICK ITS STUBBY LITTLE WINGS OUT 
AND STOP ITS SIBLINGS GETTING PAST IT 
SO IT ALWAYS GETS FED FIRST 
SO UNFORTUNATELY THIS YEAR ALTHOUGH WE HAD THREE 
AND THE THIRD LASTED ABOUT A WEEK OR TEN DAYS 
THEN THERE JUST WASN'T ENOUGH FOOD IT WASN'T GETTING ENOUGH AND SO IT DIED 
KEVIN I SEE IN YOUR BOX YOU'VE GOT SOME MATERIAL IN THE BOTTOM BECAUSE AN OWL THEY DON'T MAKE A NEST 
THEY JUST LAY ON PELLETS HAVE YOU PUT SOMETHING IN THAT BOX YES 
WE DECIDED TO STICK SOME OLD WOOD SHAVINGS DOWN IN THERE 
BECAUSE THE BOX IS AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE DEGREES SO IF WE HADN'T PUT SOMETHING IN THERE 
ALL THE EGGS MIGHT HAVE ROLLED DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM 
AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO SIT ON THEM 
THIS IS WHY YOU MAY HAVE GOT THE TAWNY OWL IN MM 
YOU SEE THAT'S ANOTHER THING I'VE NOT DONE THAT BUT I THINK MY OWL BOX IS TOO STRAIGHT 
I THINK IT'S GOT TO GO AT AN ANGLE LIKE THIS 
YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SEE IS THE MOTHER OWL COMING TO THE BOX TO FEED THOSE CHICKS 
COME ON MUM WHERE'S YOUR MOUSE BRING A MOUSE IN 
ONE'S GOING ASLEEP AGAIN HE'S GIVEN UP HMM 
WE'VE GOT A YOUNG RAT COR THAT WAS QUICK 
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT 
WE CAN'T SEE THE MOTHER OWL 
BUT THERE'S WHERE SHE DROPS THE RAT INTO THE CHICKS 
I CAN SEE WHY NOW THEY DON'T FEED VERY OFTEN 
A MEAL LIKE THAT WOULD LAST ME A WEEK 
WELL WELL 
AND YOU TAKE NOTICE THAT THE BIGGEST ONE HAD THE MEAL 
WHAT I CAN SEE OF IT 
AND THAT WAS A YOUNG RAT NO MOUSE TOO BIG 
STILL TRYING TO GET RID OF IT NOW 
AND I DON'T THINK HE'LL FEED THAT ONE AGAIN TONIGHT 
HE'S GOT TO FEED THE OTHER ONE NATURALLY BUT WHEN I DON'T KNOW 
THAT WAS WORTH WAITING FOR 
JULIE 
YES OH I THOUGHT YOU WAS IN THE BATH 
NO NO WELL I'M GOING UP TO THE GROUND NOW 
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE I DON'T KNOW WELL MAYBE A COUPLE OF HOURS 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I'LL GO IN THE GARDEN 
IT NEEDS DOING YES I KNOW THAT EVEN I COULD TELL YOU THOUGH CHEEKY 
SEE YOU LATER BABE BYE ALL RIGHT BYE 
HE'S NOT A MAN TO SIT STILL 
HE WANTS THINGS DONE LIKE YESTERDAY AND IT CAN'T ALWAYS BE DONE SO QUICK 
AS HE GOT OLDER I THINK HE'S GOT WORSE REALLY BECAUSE HE'S LEARNED TO DO SO MANY THINGS NOW 
SO HE'S TRYING TO GET THIS DONE AND THAT DONE 
AND HE NEEDS TO UNWIND A BIT SOMETIMES 
HIS MIND'S ALWAYS TICKING OVER HE'S ALWAYS THINKING OF NEW THINGS TO DO I THINK 
AN OLD MATE OF MINE MICHAEL WOODS IS COMING DOWN TO MY LAND TODAY 
IS THAT YOU JOHNNY 
HELLO OUR MIKE 
HE'S A REAL EXPERT ON DORMICE WHAT WILL HE THINK OF MY IDEA 
NICE TO SEE YOU MY FRIEND AND YOU 
I'M JUST DIGGING THIS UP LIKE THIS LOOK 
AND WHAT I'LL DO IS CUT IT OFF LIKE THAT SEE O. K. 
RIGHT WHAT'S THAT FOR WELL SOMEBODY SAID TO ME THAT A DORMOUSE WOULD GO IN A TENNIS BALL 
I SAID WHAT I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT YOU KNOW 
ANYWAY SO I'M GOING TO TRY IT OUT 
CUT A HOLE IN THE TENNIS BALL SO THE MOUSE WILL GO IN 
AND YOU STICK THIS ONE SOMEHOW INTO THE BALL 
STICK IT INTO THE GROUND LIKE THAT LOOK 
THE MOUSE SHOULD COME TO THE BALL AND CLAMBER AROUND AND GET UP INTO THE HOLE LIKE THAT 
AND YOU WILL FIND OUT THIS IS WHAT THE PEOPLE TELL ME 
THAT HE'LL BUNG IT IN WITH THE DRY GRASS AND HE'LL LIVE IN THERE 
I'M PRETTY UNCERTAIN THAT YOU'LL GET A DORMOUSE IN THERE NO NO 
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I'VE BROUGHT SHALL I 
AND THEN YOU'LL SEE WHAT WE DO FOR DORMICE O. K. 
THESE ARE NESTING TUBES O. K. 
SO THESE ARE TO FIND OUT IF YOU'VE GOT DORMICE HERE 
IF YOU HAVE THEN YOU CAN PUT UP BOXES WHICH ARE A BIT LIKE BIRD BOXES 
AND THAT'S FOR THEM TO BREED IN AND GIVES THEM WHAT ARE EFFECTIVELY TREEHOLES 
BUT BEFORE YOU SPEND A LOT ON LOADS OF NEST BOXES 
WE USE THESE NESTING TUBES BECAUSE DORMICE WILL CAMP IN THESE 
AND THE IDEA OF THEIR SIZE IS SO THEY WON'T BREED 
IT'S A SURVEY TOOL RATHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE OH YEAH YES 
SO WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN THE FUTURE IS A REALLY DENSE NEST 
WITH GREEN LEAVES WHICH THEY GET FROM UP IN THE TREES 
WHY DON'T THEY COME DOWN TO THE FLOOR 
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY AVOID BEING EATEN THEY LIVE AT VERY LOW DENSITIES 
THEY LIVE FOR A LONG TIME SIX OR SEVEN YEARS WHICH IS A VERY LONG TIME FOR A RODENT 
AND OF COURSE TAWNY OWLS WILL TAKE THEM IF THEY'RE ON THE GROUND 
MAINLY FEEDING ON HAZEL YOU KNOW THE NUT HAZEL YEAH THAT'S IN THE AUTUMN 
IN THE SPRING THEY'LL BE EATING FLOWERS WHEN THEY FIRST COME OUT OF HIBERNATION 
GENERALLY IT'S HAWTHORN AS A GOOD FLOWER TO EAT THEY TAKE BLACKTHORN AS WELL 
ANYTHING WITH A NICE RICH NECTAR AND POLLEN TO FEED ON 
WHERE WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE TO PUT THESE UP 
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF HAZEL HERE 
THERE'S A GOOD ONE OVER THERE LET'S GO UP AND PUT ONE ON THERE 
THAT'S A NICE BRANCH THAT ONE THAT LEANS 
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD ONE BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IS TO CONNECT FROM ONE TREE TO THE NEXT 
SO YOU JUST PUT 'EM ON THERE AND THEN WE FASTEN THIS 
UNDERNEATH NOT ON TOP NO UNDERNEATH 
AND THEY'LL COME ALONG AND JUMP DOWN ON THAT LEDGE 
YES THEY TEND TO LIKE THEM IF THEY FACE INTO THE TREE INTO DARKNESS 
MY WOODS HAVE GOT EVERYTHING A DORMOUSE NEEDS 
I RECKON I'LL GET SOME CAMPING IN THESE BOXES 
YOU CAN GET LARGE NUMBERS 
I'VE HAD OUT OF ONE HUNDRED I'VE HAD TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY WITH NESTS IN 
I ONLY WANT ONE ONLY ONE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU NEED 
WHY WHY IS THIS ONE SO STEEP BECAUSE THE BRANCH IS STEEP 
SO I HADN'T GOT TO KEEP THEM LEVEL THEN EXACTLY 
NO THEY DO NEED TO TIP THAT WAY OR YOU'LL GET WATER RUNNING IN 
JUST LISTEN TO ME WHAT'S YOUR BED LIKE ISN'T YOUR BED PRETTY LEVEL 
YES 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU MUST DO OF COURSE IF YOU HAPPEN TO FIND A NEST 
IS STOP AT THAT POINT AND NOT LOOK IN ANY OTHER TUBES UNTIL YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE LICENSED WITH YOU TO DO IT 
BECAUSE TO DISTURB A DORMOUSE IN ITS NEST IS UNLAWFUL 
UNLESS YOU HAVE A LICENCE 
DORMICE ARE LICENSED OF COURSE BECAUSE THEY'RE PROTECTED COS THEY'RE SO RARE 
THEY RECKON THERE'S ONLY ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND LEFT IN THE COUNTRY 
WELL MATE I HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN JULY 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD NICE SEEING YOU JOHNNY AND YOU MY FRIEND BYE 
BUT D'YOU KNOW HE THINKS MY TENNIS BALLS WON'T WORK 
BUT I'M GOING TO PUT SOME FOOD IN MINE SOME NUTS AND SOME RAISINS 
IT'S NOW TIME FOR ME TO VISIT AN OLD FRIEND 
MY DEAR BAMBI IS BURIED HERE ON MY LAND 
EVERY FEW DAYS I COME TO SAY HELLO AND SHOW HER THAT SHE'S NOT FORGOTTEN 
IT'S GETTING ON FOR TWELVE MONTHS AGO WE PUT BAMBI TO SLEEP 
STILL HURTS INSIDE 
YOU NEVER FORGET IT AND IT'LL NEVER HEAL 
THEY SAY TIME'S A HEALER 
OF COURSE IT'S GETTING BETTER COS I'M ACCEPTING IT 
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO LOSE A FRIEND LIKE THAT 
AND YOU GET TO KNOW ONE FOR TWELVE YEARS AND GET INTO THE HEART OF ONE OOH IT'S IN MY HEART 
MY HEART NEARLY EXPLODED WHEN SHE DIED 
AND MY FAMILY EXACTLY THE SAME 
BUT TO GET SO CLOSE TO A WILD ANIMAL AND TO LOVE AN ANIMAL LIKE THAT 
THIS IS WHY IT HURTS 
SHE USED TO ROAR LIKE A STAG SOMETIMES 
WHEN SHE'D HEAR HIM PULL UP OUTSIDE SHE KNEW THE TRUCK 
AND SHE'D SHOUT SOMETIMES WHEN HE WENT 
THEY WERE ONE REALLY 
BIT LIKE JOHN AND I BUT SHE STEPPED IN IN THE MIDDLE 
BAMBI BAMBI 
BAMBI 
I'M GOING TO COME IN WITH SOME BEDDING NOW SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO ACT TOO SILLY O. K. 
JOHN USED TO PUT SAWDUST DOWN FOR HER TO KEEP IT DRY SO IT WAS A BIT OF A MESS AT TIMES 
BUT OF COURSE IT WAS LOVELY HAVING HER 
BAMB HEY BAMBI 
BAMBI THE CAMERA GET OUT OF THAT 
I WAS GOING TO HAVE HER PUT ON MY LAWN 
AND MY SONS AND MY WIFE AS SOON AS WE BOUGHT THE GROUND 
THAT'S WHAT SHE'S DECIDED BAMBI GO BACK IN THE WOODS 
IT IS HARD LIVING WITHOUT BAMBI BUT LIFE STILL HAS TO GO ON 
PAULINE FROM SECRET WORLD HAVE JUST RANG ME TELLING ME THAT THE BADGERS ARE CLEAR OF T. B. 
THAT'S THE BEST NEWS I'VE HEARD YET WONDERFUL NEWS 
I REALLY WANT TO GET BACK TO FILM THOSE FOX CUBS 
BUT THE MOTHER MIGHT HAVE MOVED THEM ON COS SHE PICKED UP MY SCENT 
WE'VE GONE BACK TO THE FOX CUBS AGAIN 
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'M THERE OR NOT 
BUT WE'VE COME INTO IT A DIFFERENT WAY COS THE WIND HAVE CHANGED 
WE'RE IN LUCK THE VIXEN HAVE COME BACK 
BUT IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG 
SHE'S LOOKING FOR HER CUBS 
SHE'S LOST HER CUBS 
THE VIXEN'S JUST GONE DOWN INTO HER DEN 
SHE'S BOUND TO COME OUT AGAIN IN A MINUTE TO LOOK FOR THE CUBS 
I THINK SHE'VE SEEN SOMETHING 
OH LOOK SHE'S FOUND HER CUBS 
THAT'S FANTASTIC 
I THINK THAT LITTLE ROUGH ONE MUST HAVE DIED 
BUT THAT'S NATURE TAKING ITS COURSE 
AT LEAST SHE GOT ALL THE OTHER ONES ANYWAY 
NEXT WEEK I'M OFF TO SOMERSET TO SEARCH FOR ROE DEER CALVES 
IN THAT LITTLE HOLE THERE LOOK DOWN THERE OH I DON'T BELIEVE IT 
AND GET REALLY CLOSE TO SOME WILD BOAR 
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT I'M GOING TO SIT THERE
