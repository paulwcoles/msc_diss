A MOBILE PHONE FOR A FIVER IS IT 
A GOOD DEAL AND HOW CAN THEY GET 
AWAY WITH SELLING THEM SO CHEAPLY 
AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PRICING 
OF CIGARETTES SEVEN SUPERMARKETS 
ARE UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT ALONG WITH 
THE TOBACCO COMPANIES THEMSELVES 
WE'LL BE EXPLAINING WHAT'S GOING ON 
ALSO TODAY TRANSFERRING YOUR ISA 
YOU'RE STILL ASKING WHY IS IT 
TAKING SO LONG 
IT'S THE HOME OF THE MICROWAVE 
SPLATTER GUARD AND THE PLASTIC 
BANANA PROTECTOR THIS IS LAKELAND 
IN THE LAKE DISTRICT IT'S MA MAJOR 
COMPANY NOW BUT IT BEGAN BY A FIRM 
SELLING PLASTIC BAGS TO POULTRY 
FARMERS FARMERS FIRST MOBILE PHONES FOR ONLY FIVE 
THAT'S ON OFFER FROM ONE 
SUPERMARKET TODAY IT MAY BE A ONE 
OFF PROMOTION BUT IS IT GOOD VALUE 
FOR THE CUSTOMER HOW DO YOU TURN 
THIS INTO THIS THROUGH THE MAGIC 
OF AN OPEN MARKET ECONOMY IT WOULD 
SEEM UNCHAIN OF SUPERMARKETS IS 
STOCKING A PAY AS YOU GO MOBILE 
PHONE FOR JUST FIVE THEY RECKON 
WE'LL BE QUEUING UP TO ANSWER THEIR 
CALL CALL A PHONE FOR A FIVER IS CHEAPER THAN 
MOST BOTTLES OF WINE A D. V. D. AND 
IF YOU LIKE YOUR COFFEE TWO POSH 
ONES HAND SAIBGS ARE BASIC YOU 
CAN'T ACCESS THE INTERNET OR TAKE 
PHOTOGRAPHS ON THEM BUT YOU CAN 
SEND AND RECEIVE PHONE CALLS AND 
TEXT MESSAGES IN FACT IT ONLY 
COSTS ABOUT ONE POINT OH ONE POINT FIVE OH MORE THAN 
TOY PHONES BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IT'S CHEAP AND CHEERFUL SO IF UP 
LEFT IT IN A PUB YOU WOULDN'T BE 
THAT WORRIED 
I WOULD EXPECT THE 
COST OF THE CALLS WOULD BE MORE 
BECAUSE IT'S PAY AS YOU GO 
DO YOU 
REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST GOT A 
MOBILE PHONE AND HOW MUCH THEY 
COST 
YES I DO IT USED TO BE PAY COST AS YOU GO WAS ABOUT TEN AND IT 
WOULD LAST ABOUT GOD YOU WOULD BE 
ON THERE FOR THREE MINUTES AND 
BEFORE YOU'D KNOW IT YOUR TEN WAS 
USED UP 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IF IT'S 
PAY AS YOU GO RATHER THAN A 
CONTRACT 
I PREFER A PAY AS YOU GO CONTRACT I ONLY USE IT FOR EMERGENCIES L. 
DON'T CHAT WITH MY FRIENDS ON IT 
FOR ME PAY AS YOU GO WOULD BE 
BETTER 
IF THEY ARE SELLING A PHONE BETTER LIKE THIS FOR FIVE HOW CAN THEY BE 
MAKING ANY MONEY I SUSPECT THEY'RE 
NOT 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TELECOMS NOT MARKET AT THE MOMENT IT'S A BIT OF 
A BEAR FAT THERE ARE MORE MOBILE 
PHONE CONTRACTS IN THE U. K. THAN 
THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE ARE SIXTY 
MILLION OF US AND SEVENTY MILLION 
CONTRACTS WHO KNOWS HOW MANY HAND 
SETS ARE OUT THERE I KNOW I HAVE 
THREE 
IN MY DRAWER L. HAVE AT LEAST THREE LYING ABOUT WITH ALL OF THAT IN MIND MOBILE PHONE COMPANIES WILL 
DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO TRY TO GET 
OUR CUSTOM IT'S UNLIKE LITTLE 
THEY'RE MAKING ANY MONEY ON A HAND 
SET THAT COSTS US FIVE BUT ONCE WE 
START BUYING THAT HAND SET AND WE 
START MAKING PHONE CALLS THAT'S 
WHEN THEY'LL MAKE MONEY 
TEN YEARS 
AGO A MOBILE PHONE WOULD HAVE COST 
OF THE ORDER THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED THE 
MOBILE COMPANIES USED TO SUBSIDISE 
THE COST OF THAT TO THE CAN U. S. MER 
SO THEY WOULD SIGN UNTO THEIR 
SERVICES SERVICES CUSTOMER SO THEY WOULD SIGN UP TO 
THEIR SUBSIDIES NOWADAYS MOBILES 
ARE CHEAPER BUT THERE'S STILL AN 
ELEMENT OF SUBSIDY MOBILE PHONE 
COMPANIES WILL ALWAYS MAKE THEIR 
MONEY FROM THE CALLS 
THEY MAKE 
THEIR MONEY FROM THE CALLS WE MAKE 
BUT AS TECHNOLOGY EINVOLVES OTHER 
COMPANIES HAVE LOOKED AT OTHER WAYS 
OF GETTING IN SOME REVENUE STREAMS 
ADVERTISING IS A NEW ONE THERE'S A 
COMPANY THAT LAUNCHED IN THE U. K. 
LAST SEPTEMBER THEY GIVE YOU A 
CONTRACT THEY DON'T GIVE YOU A 
HAND SET THEY GIVE YOU A CONTRACT 
YOU HAVE TO BE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 
SIXTEEN AND THIRTY FOUR YOU GET FREE CALLS AND 
FREE TEXTS ALTHOUGH IT IS LIMITED 
PER MONTH IN CHANGE FOR YOU 
ACCEPTING THREE ADVERTS ON YOUR 
MOBILE PHONE EVERY DAY THEY GET 
THEIR MONEY FROM THE ADVERTISERS 
RATHER THAN THE CALLS IT'S 
TEMPTING US IN AND TRYING TO GET 
OUR CUSTOM 
I JUST MISSED THAT AGE 
RANGE SUCH A SHAME 
THIS PHONE I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS 
NOT FROM A MUSEUM THIS IS FROM THE 
B. B. C.'S OUR WORKING LUNCH OFFICE IT 
STILL HAS AN AERIAL LOOK AT THAT 
HELLO JOE NINETY THIS IS PROBABLY THE 
PHONE THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT USED 
TO COST ONE HUNDRED IT'S A DRAMATIC 
COMPARISON WITH WHAT YOU CAN 
AND MAYBE PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF 
EIGHTEEN BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED TO BE 
CREDIT CHECKED HOWEVER THE BAD 
THINGS ARE YOU HAVE TO PAY THE FULL 
PRICE OF THE HANDSET UP FRONT 
ALTHOUGH AT JUST A FIVE THAT'S NOT 
TOO MUCH OF A HARDSHIP 
TRADITIONALLY PAY AS YOU GO 
CONTRACTS WILL COST YOU MORE PER 
MINUTE THAN A MONTHLY CONTRACT 
CONTRACT A MONTHLY CONTRACT 
USUALLY COMES WITH A HANDSET YOUR 
NON INCLUSIVE IS USUALLY CHEAPER 
THAN ON PAY AS YOU GO BUT YOU HAVE 
A FIXED MONTHLY PAYMENT 
THE THIRD OPTION SIMM CARD FOR 
THAT YOU NEED YOUR OWN HAND SET 
YOU GET A CARD TO PUT INTO THAT 
THE CONTRACT ONLY LAST DAYS IF 
YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO STOP USING 
IT YOU DON'T HAVE PENALTIES FOR 
EVERYBODY YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT DO 
YOU USE TEXT DO YOU LIKE TO USE 
THE PHONE DO YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD 
OR TAKE PICTURES IT'S AN 
INDIVIDUAL THING ANOTHER COMMENT 
FROM EDDIE MURPHY HE SAID HE 
DOESN'T THINK THIS PHONE CAN BE 
MAKING ANY MONEY FOR THE 
SUPERMARKET SELLING IT EITHER LIKE 
THE PHONE COMPANY IT'S JUST A WAY 
OF GETTING PEOPLE THROUGH THE DOORS 
IT'S A LOSS LEADER A WAY OF 
ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS 
ONE THING 
WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED IT'S AMAZING 
P. R. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT IT'S IN 
A LOT OF THE PAPERS THEY COULD SEE 
THAT AS AN INVESTMENT WE'RE GOING 
TO BE SPEAKING TO A P. R. EXPERT ABOUT 
HOW COMPANIES DO THIS LATER IN THE 
PROGRAMME PROGRAMME CAN I JUST INJECT 
DO YOU WANT TO 
INTERRUPT AGAIN 
ON THIS BUSINESS 
OF PEOPLE USING THE PHONE TOO MUCH 
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE GOING 
SOMEWHERE THEY'RE BORED THEY HAVE 
TO WALK BETWEEN THE BUS STOP AND 
HOME THEY CALL YOU AND YOU MIGHT 
BE DOING SOMETHING THEY'RE ONLY 
CALLING YOU BECAUSE THEY'RE BORED 
THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY 
WHAT I HATE I HAVE COFFEE WITH 
PEOPLE EVERYBODY AROUND THE TABLE 
IS TALKING TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND I'M 
NOT TALKING TO ANYBODY IT'S RUDE 
THERE IS NEWS THIS LUNCH TIME 
THERE'S A NASTY SMELL ULT NO 
ARTILLERYS FROM THE TOBACCO FIRMS 
THAT'S THE MESSAGE BETWEEN THE 
LINES READ WILLING AT THE OFFICE OF 
FAIR TRADING WHAT DOES IT MEAN 
SIMON JACK HAS BEEN FOLLOWING IT 
ALL MORNING I'VE HEARD YOU ON THE 
RADIO I'M SEEING YOU IN THE FLESH 
WHAT ARE THEY DOING 
IF YOU'RE A 
SMOKER AND EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT AND 
YOU'VE BEEN UP TO THE PACKS BEHIND 
THE COUNTER THEY ALL LOOK LIKE 
THEY COST PRETTY MUCH THE SAME 
ACCORDING TO THE OFT THAT ISN'T 
JUST BY MAGIC THEY ARE ALLEGING 
THAT IF FOR EXAMPLE ONE 
MANUFACTURER SUPPLIES CIGARETTES AT 
FIVE POINT FIVE OH AND WANTS IT TO BE FIVE P. MORE 
EXPENSIVE THAN A WELL KNOWN BRAND 
THAT OTHER WELL KNOWN BRAND MOVES 
ITS PRIELS THEY'LL INSTRUCT THE 
RETAILER MOVE THEIR PRICES UP IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THEM SO THEY'RE 
LINKING THE PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCT 
TO THE PRICE OF SOMEBODY ELSE'S 
PRODUCT THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW 
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL PRICE CO 
ORDINATION THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE 
GOING ON ABOUT TODAY 
WHY ARE THEY 
GOING AFTER IT NOW 
YOU HAVE TO BE 
UNDER A ROCK NOT TO HAVE WALKED 
INTO A TOBACCO SHOP AND NOT SEEN 
THAT THEY'RE IN A SCOPE WITH EACH 
OTHER THEY STARTED THIS 
INVESTIGATION IN TWO THOUSAND THREE SO THIS HAS 
COME TO LIGHT OVER THAT PROCESS 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS COMING TO LIGHT AT 
THE MOMENT THEY SEEM TO BE IN 
OVERDRIVE THE OFT 
WORKING LUNCH 
REGULAR WILL REMEMBER THAT AIRLINES 
THERE WAS A DING DONG OVER THAT 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FINE FOR BRITISH 
AIRWAYS THEYVE GONE AFTER THE AIRWAYS AIRLINES NOW THE TOBACCO FIRMS L. 
DON'T REMEMBER THEM BEING THIS 
ACTIVE IN THE LAST DECADE AM I 
WRONG

I SAID HAVE YOU HIRED AN EXTRA TWO HUNDRED 
STAFF THEY SAID THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS THEY TAKE A LONG 
TIME THE CONSTRUCTION ONE WE HEARD 
ABOUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THAT'S 
BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS THEY TELL 
ME IT'S COINCIDENCE THAT THEY'RE 
ALL BUBBLING TO THE TOP AT THE 
MOMENT AS FOR THE CIGARETTE 
COMPANIES WHAT'S HAPPENING NEXT 
THERE ARE TWO BASIC RESPONSES BOTH 
FROM THE TOBACCO COMPANIES AND THE 
RETAILERS ONE IS WE HAVEN'T HAD 
TIME TO REACT WE'LL LOOK AT THE 
REPORT TESCOS FOR EXAMPLE SAVED 
WE DON'T ACCEPT WE'VE DONE 
ANYTHING THAT WOULD HARM THE 
CONSUMER THAT'S A LITTLE BIT 
DIFFERENT FROM SAYING THEY DENY 
WHAT'S IN THE REPORT THEY'LL HAVE 
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS PROBABLY UNTIL 
THE END OF THE YEAR TO COME BACK 
WITH A DEFENCE THEN WE'LL HAVE A 
HEARING AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING 
ON 
YOU COULD CO OPERATE TO DRIVE ON MARKETS DOWN WHICH COULD BE MARKET 
DISTORTING FOR SOME SMALLER AGENTS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE YOU GOING 
TO BED NOW YES 
HE WAS ON THE YES RADIO WHEN I WOKE UP 
THE REST OF THE NEWS B. P. HAS 
CONFIRMED IT WILL BE CLOSING THE 
FORTIES PIPELINE SYSTEM CARRYING

THAT PLANNED STRIKE AT THE 
GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY THAT DECISION 
WILL THIRTY PER CENT OF THE NORTH SEA OIL IT 
WILL CAUSE UP TO SEVENTY PLATFORMS TO 
SHUT DOWN OR REDUCE PRODUCTION 
THAT OBVIOUSLY FOLLOWS VERY MUCH IN 
THE NEWS TODAY SO WE'LL MOVE ON 
WE'VE HEARD FROM A MAN WHO IS 
ANNOYED WITH FREE GIFT RICHARD 
RECOMMENDER WAS SENT A PAIR OF BABY 
SOCKS FROM THE H. S. B. C. OFFERING TO 
GROW HIS BUSINESS A FEW SIZES 
HERE WE ARE HE SAYS I CAN'T 
BELIEVE THE CRASS BEHAVIOUR OF H. S. B. C. 
IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE DO YOU 
THINK THEY KNOW THERE'S A CREDIT 
CRUNCH RECESSION AND LOTS OF 
PROBLEMS WITH THE BANKING 
COMMUNITY WE HAVEN'T A RECESSION 
YET BUT THIS IS WHAT RICHARD SAYS 
NOT TO MENTION THE EXCESSIVE WASTE 
AND WORRIES ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING 
I'M THINKING OF MOVING MY BUSINESS 
BANKING ACCOUNT TO MOTHERCARE 
IMMEDIATELY WHERE AT LEAST I'LL GET 
A CHOICE OF SOCKS WITH WHICH TO 
GROW MY BUSINESS WE WILL BRING 
YOU STATEMENT FROM H. S. B. C. DURING 
THE PROGRAMME IF WE GET ONE WE'VE 
SENT REQUEST THEIR WAY 
THE CAR WINDSCREEN WIPEER TODAY 
CELEBRATES ITS ONE HUNDREDTH BIRTHDAY 
GLADSTONE ADAMS CAME UP WITH THE 
IDEA EXACTLY A CENTURY AGO AS HE 
DROVE HOME FROM LONDON THROUGH A 
SNOWSTORM HAVING WATCHED NEWCASTLE 
UNITED PLAY WOLVES IN THE NINETEEN OH EIGHT F. A. 
CUP FINAL DON'T SAY WE HAVEN'T GOT 
DETAIL FOR YOU TODAY ADAM 
WHAT DID THEY DO BEFORE DID THEY 
HAVE LITTLE MAN JUST RUNNING BY 
THE CAR IT WAS DONE WITH MOP 
THE ADVERTISING FIRM W. P. P. SAID IN 
THE FIRST QUARTER BOTH OPERATING 
MARGINS AND PROFITABILITY WERE 
AHEAD OF BUDGET LAST YEAR IT SAID 
THE GROUP REMAINS ON COURSE TO 
ACHIEVE ITS PROFIT MARGIN OBJECTIVE 
OF JUST OVER FIFTEEN PER CENT IN THE FIRST 
QUARTER OF THIS YEAR REPORTED 
REVENUE UP FOURTEEN PER CENT WHY AM I TELLING 
YOU ALL THIS BECAUSE BIZARRE 
THINGS ARE HAPPENING THAT IS 
BASICALLY GOOD NEWS AND YET THE 
SHARES AT W. P. P. IF NOT THE WORLD'S 
BIGGEST ADVERTISING GROUP ONLY ONE 
WERE THE WORST PERFORMING F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED 
THIS MORNING 
ALTHOUGH ON THE FACE OF IT THE 
NUMBERS LOOK GOOD FOR W. P. P. IT 
APPEARS THAT INVESTORS ARE REALLY 
CONCENTRATING ON THE WEAKNESS IN 
THE EUROPEAN MARKET THEY'RE 
SEARCHING OUT THE BAD NEWS AND 
KNOCKING SHARES DOWN AS A RESULT 
THERE'S SOME OF THE OTHER MEDIA 
MOVERS TODAY B. SKY B. UP BUT I. T. V. AND 
PEARSON ARE DOWN 
LET'S LOOK AROUND SOME OF THE MORE 
WIDELY HELD SHARES A BIT OF A 
MIXED DAY L. THINK WE'LL SEE THE 
F. T. S. E. UP WE WERE IN A BIT OF 
TROUBLE THIS TIME YESTERDAY IT 
LOOKS LIKE THAT HAS GONE AWAY FOR 
THE MOMENT AT LEAST B. P. PADDY WAS 
TALKING ABOUT A RELATED ISSUE HERE 
IS THE OPERATOR OF THE FORTIES 
PIPELINE WHICH WE HEARD WAS GOING 
TO BE SHUT BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE 
PLANNED THIS WEEKEND AT A MAJOR 
SCOTTISH REFINERY B. P. SHARES ARE UP 
ONE OTHER ONE I WANTED TO POINT OUT 
B. T. BECAUSE VIEWER MR. MICHAEL 
WILLIAMS SAYS HE'S BEEN FOLLOWING 
THE FORTUNES OF B. T. SHARES FOR 
SEVERAL MONTHS AND SEEN THAT 
THEY'VE LOST ABOUT THIRD OF ITS VALUE VALUE HE SAYS I'VE NOTICED THAT THE 
MAJORITY OF BROKERS NOW LATE B. T. AS 
A STRONG BUY THEY'RE SAYING GO OUT 
AND BUY THESE SHARES YET THE PRICE 
IS STILL LOW WHY IS THAT LET'S 
HAVE LOOK AT WHAT HE'S TALKING 
ABOUT ON EARTH I DIDN'T MEAN THAT 
BADLY JUST MEANT EXPLAIN WHAT 
YOU MEANT THE SHARES HAVE HAD THIS 
AWFUL PERFORMANCE THREE HUNDRED FORTY AT THE TOP 
ONE HUNDRED DOWN THERE IT HAS LOST 
SUBSTANTIAL CHUNK I'M NOT SHARE 
THAT ALL BROKERS ARE RECOMMENDING 
TO BUY BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY A 
LOT OF PEOPLE RECOMMENDING IT 
IT PAID GOOD DIVIDEND LAST YEAR 
AND THE COMPANY IS FOCUSSING ON 
MORE GROWING REVENUE THROUGH 
DEVELOPING HIGH SPEED BROADBAND 
NOT TO MENTION THE IMMINENT ARRIVAL 
OF A NEW BOSS IAN LIVINGSTONE SO 
ANALYSTS ARE SEEING LOT OF 
POSITIVES FOR THIS COMPANY DESPITE 
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ITS SHARE PRICE 
AND IT MAY BE THAT THEY'RE 
RECOMMENDING A BUY BECAUSE IT HAS 
FALLEN SO MUCH AND THEY FEEL IT 
SHOULD TURN UP WE'LL TALK MORE 
ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT WITH OUR 
GUEST OF THE DAY BUT FOR THE MOMENT 
MOVING ON TO A RELATED ISSUE COLT 
TELECOM IN THE SAME SECTOR SAID IT 
HAS MADE AN ENCOURAGING START TO 
THE YEAR 
MITCHELLS AND BUTTER A PUB GROUP 
CONFIRMED IT IS NO LONGER IN 
DISCUSSIONS FOR AN OFFER FOR THE 
WHOLE COMPANY THOUGH TALKS WITH 
INVESTORS SEEKING JUST A STAKE IN 
THE GROUP ARE CONTINUING AVIV VA 
REPORTED A FIVE PER CENT RISE IN FIRST QUARTER 
SALES GROWTH IN ASIA AND CENTRAL 
EUROPE OFFSET TOUGHER CONDITIONS 
HERE LIFE AND PENSIONS SAILS 
INCREASED UP FIVE PER CENT TOTAL LONG TERM 
SAVINGS FOR NEW BUSINESS WERE TWO PER CENT 
HIGHER THAT IS INTERESTING AS IT 
SEEMS TO REFLECT CONFIDENCE THAT 
PEOPLE SHOULD BE INVESTING AND 
PUTTING MONEY INTO THEIR PENSIONS 
HOWEVER DESPITE GOOD NEWS FOR THEM 
THEIR SHARES ARE DOWN TWO BITS OF 
GOOD NEWS THE LONDON STOCK 
EXCHANGE IS UP AND CARPHONE 
WAREHOUSE IS UP FOUR PER CENT 
A CLEAN SWEEP ACROSS THE MAJOR 
MARKETS ALL OF THEM ARE UP 
HOORAY HOORAY JEREMY TIGUE IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT 
THE MARKETS WELCOME I HAVEN'T 
SEEN YOU FOR LONG TIME TOO LONG 
LET'S BEGIN WITH B. T. AS OUR VIEWER 
WERE CONFUSED BROKERS THINK THIS 
SHARE IS A GOOD 
BUY AND IT HAS LOST 
A THIRD OF ITS VALUE 
ONE OF THE 
PROBLEMS IS MORE COMPETITION FROM 
THE LIKES OF CARPHONE WAREHOUSE 
THEIR SHARE PRICE IS UP AND B. T.'S 
WAS STATIC AND THEY HAVE HAD A 
CHANGE OF CHAIRMAN AND NOW A CHANGE 
OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE PEOPLE ARE 
THINKING LET'S WAIT AND SEE IF 
THERE WILL BE A STRANGE OF STRATEGY 
THERE IS NO RUSH 
TO BUY INTEREST INTEREST TO GO SEE CARPHONE WAREHOUSE UP 
TODAY AS B. T. GOT OUT OF THE MOBILE 
PHONE BUSINESS THE GROWING PART OF 
THE BUSINESS AND STAYED WITH HOME 
PHONES WHICH WASN'T GOING BEFORE 
NTRO 
AND CARPHONE WAREHOUSE ARE NTRO MOVING INTO THAT AREA 
AND THE 
INTERNET BUSINESS AS WELL 
THEY ARE 
UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL DIRECTIONS 
BUT THEY HAVE ADVANTAGES THE FACT 
THEY WERE SO BIG 
THAT'S THE 
PROBLEM OF BEING THE DOMINANT 
PLAYER IF YOU'RE THE BIGGEST 
PLAYER WHERE ELSE IS THERE TO GO 
THERE'S A LOT MORE TO LOSE THAN TO 
GAIN 
THERE'S A LOT MORE TO LOSE THAN TO GAIN GAIN IN THE PAST WEEK 
THEY'VE GONE DOWN BECAUSE OF THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH WORKING ITS WAY 
THROUGH THE SYSTEM RBS HAVE TO 
RAISE LOT MORE MONEY FROM 
SHAREHOLDERS HBOS BECAUSE PEOPLE 
THINK THEY ARE NEXT IN LINE AND 
PERSIMMON BECAUSE THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH IS HAVING AN EFFECT ON THE 
HOUSING MARKET PEOPLE WANT TO GO 
BUY CAN'T GET MORTGAGE AND AND THOMAS COOK YOU PROBABLY DON'T 
HOLIDAY AS MUCH PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
TALKING A LOT ABOUT ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND A LOT OF VIEWERS ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT IT BECAUSE IF THEY 
DON'T DO ANYTHING THEIR 
SHAREHOLDING WILL FALL YES OR YES OR THEY HAVE TO SPEND MONEY AND BUY 
SHARES THEY THE OPTION OF SPENDING 
RIGHTS TO SOMEBODY ELSE DO YOU 
HAVE VIEW ON WHAT PEERBL SHOULD DO 
IT DEPENDS ON PEOPLE SHOULD 
DO DO IT DEPENDS ON PEOPLE'S 
CIRCUMSTANCES RBS'S SHARE PRICE A 
YEAR AGO WAS SIX POINT FIVE OH 
WHAT IS IT NOW 
IF YOU ARE BUYING THE RIGHTS IT IS 
TWO POINT OH OH IT'S CHANGED COMPLETELY L. L. 
THINK RBS WILL BE A MUCH LESS 
EXCITING INVESTMENT OVER THE NEXT 
FIVE YEARS IT WON'T GROW SO 
QUICKLY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU 
WILL MAKE MORE MONEY FROM YOUR 
DIVIDEND FROM RBS 
I KNOW THIS 
SECTOR IS FACING PROBLEMS THE FALL 
IN THE SHARE PRICE HAS BEEN 
DRAMATIC DO YOU THINK THE FALL IN 
SHARE PRICE GENERALLY HAS 
OVERSTATED THE PROBLEMS THEY ARE 
FACING 
NO I DON'T THINK IT HAS FACING BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN 
IMMENSE THE PROBLEM HAS WELL AND 
TRULY ENDED FOR THE BANKS AND THE 
PEOPLE BORROWING FROM THE BANKS WE 
ARE GOING THROUGH A NASTY PERIOD OF 
ADADJUSTMENT 
UNLIKE THE DOWNWARD MOVEMENTS WHERE 
IT IS A COMMON THEME HERE IT IS 
DIFFERENT GLAXO ANNOUNCED FIRST 
QUARTER RESULTS THEY WENT VERY 
EXCITING BUT PEOPLE THINK PEOPLE 
WILL ALWAYS NEED PHARMACEUTICALS IT 
IS A LOW RISK INVESTMENT COMPARED 
WITH OTHERS TULLOW HAS GONE UP 
WITH THE OIL PRICE 
ADMIRAL THE 
INSURANCE BUSINESS I THINK THERE 
PEOPLE ARE FEELING MAYBE A FEW 
MONTHS AGO THE MARKET WAS GOING TO 
BECOME COMPETITIVE THE SHARE PRICE 
FELL A LOT AND THERE'S BEEN A 
RECOVERY AND PEOPLE ARE OPTIMISTIC 
ABOUT INSURANCE RATES THE OIL 
PRICE WAS ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL IT SEEMS 
TO HAVE FALLEN 
THE RISE IN OIL HAS 
BEEN AMAZING PEOPLE NEVER THOUGHT 
WHITE STAY THIS HIGH OR EVEN GO TO 
THIS LEVEL ONE HAS TO BE CONCERNED 
THAT THE SUPPLY OF OIL AROUND THE 
WORLD IS DIMINISHING BECAUSE IT IS 
GETTING MORE DIFFICULT TO GILT OUT 
OF THE GROUND 
I REMEMBER PEOPLE 
SAY TO GO ME AT SCHOOL SOME TIME 
AGO YOU ONLY HAVE THIRTY YEARS LEFT OF 
OIL BUT AS THE PRICE GOES UP THEY 
FIND IT MORE ECONOMICAL TO DIG IT 
OUT OF THE GROUND 
YOU ARE RIGHT 
THE OIL IS NOW IN COUNTRIES LIKE 
RUSSIA AND SOME OF THE ARAB 
COUNTRIES IN THE GULF WHERE THERE 
IS NO INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO DIG IT 
OUT OF THE GROUND THEY ARE HAPPY 
TO SEE THE PRICE RISE EVEN MORE 
WE'LL LOOK AT WHAT THE NEXT WEEK 
MAY HOLD FOR US SO DON'T RUN AWAY 
THANK YOU 
MORE OF YOUR ISA TRANSFER TROUBLES 
AND THEN 
IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN TO 
NEARLY EVERYTHING AND I THOUGHT 
THIS IS NEW 
WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT 
SHE HAS BEEN BUYING I'VE BEEN ON 
THE STREETS L. WANT TO ASK YOU 
ABOUT FOOD PRICES 
I HATE IT I 
HAVE FOUR KIDS AND IT IS HARD I'M 
NOT WORKING AT THE MOMENT SO IT IS 
DIFFER DIFFER CASH ISAS OR INDIVIDUAL SAVINGS 
ACCOUNTS ARE GETTING YOUR GOAT 
THAT SOUNDED LIKE A SHEEP TO ME 
YOU REACTED WITH DISBELIEF WHEN WE 
REPORTED THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO 
TRANSFER AN ISA FROM ONE BANK OR 
BUILDING SOCIETY TO ANOTHER WITHIN 
THIRTY DAYS FOR MANY OF YOU IT'S 
TAKEN MUCH LONGER AND THE MESSAGE 
YOU'RE GETTING IN SOME BRANCHES IS 
THAT'S ALLOWED WHAT'S MORE 
THERE'S RISK OF LOSING THE 
JUICY INTEREST RATE RATE YOU WANTED 
BECAUSE OF THE DELAYS SIEM NON HAS 
BEEN FOLLOWING THIS WHAT HAVE 
PEOPLE BEEN SAYING 
LEE AND JOAN 
SAY WE CAN'T TELL YOU HOW 
FRUSTRATED WE ARE AT NOT KNOWING 
WHERE THE MONEY'S GONE IT HAS 
DISAPPEARED FOR MORE THAN A MONTH 
AND WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG TONY 
SAYS HAVING SPENT HOURS ON THE 
PHONE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK 
TO ANYONE I CALLED INTO MY LOCAL 
BRANCH YESTERDAY TO BE TOLD THAT 
HEAD OFFICE TOLD THEM DELAYS ARE 
TAKING THREE TO FOUR WEEKS TO 
PROCESS KEITH SAYS IF ANYBODY SEES 
A PIGEON WITH A NOTE ATTACHED TO 
ITS LEG PLEASE GIVE IT FOOD AND 
WATER SO IT CAN CONTINUE ITS 
JOURNEY TO MY WIFE'S BANK THAT'S 
THE FEELING YOU WOULD EXPECT THEY 
WOULD TRANCE FOREYOUR ICE SAM 
LET'S LOOK AT DETAILED COMPLAINTS 
WE'LL HEAR FROM MALCOLM HUGHES 
HANG ON THAT'S GOING IN AND GOING 
OUT THE AULD FIRM AND THE NEW FIRM 
THIRTY PLUS THIRTY WOULD EXPLAIN THIS DELAY 
PRECISELY SIXTY DAYS IS A LONG TIME 
FIFTY SIX DAYS THAT'S THE SORT OF TIME WE 
ARE THINKING ABOUT THE BANKS AND 
BUILDING SOCIETIES ARE SAY TO GO 
THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THAT IS ALL 
RIGHT 
THE THING IS THE CUSTOMER RIGHT IN THIS CASE GETTING IN TOUCH WITH 
US WERE TOLD IT IS GOING TO TAKE THIRTY 
DAYS TO DO THIS SWITCH IS THERE A 
RULE NO MATTER WHAT ALL THE 
CHATTER IS IS THERE A RULE 
PERHAPS THE F. S. A. SOME KIND OF RULE 
THE RULE IS ZERO DAYS AS WE SAID 
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THAT 
THIRTY DAYS APPLY TO 
HERE ARE THE RULES 
THAT SEEMS CLEAR 
CLEAR AS DAY 
CLARIFYING THIS THERE IS A DEBATE 
IN THE INDUSTRY OVER THIS 
YOU GO TO THE NEW MANAGER THE ISA 
MANAGER YOU WANT TO MOVE TO FILL 
IN A FORM AND THEY LOOK AFTER IT A 
ONE STOP SHOP APPROACH WITHIN 
DAYS OF THE OLD MANAGER RECEIVING 
THE INSTRUCTION THEY HAVE TO SEND 
IT TO THE OLD MANAGER THERE'S NO 
TIME LIMIT FOR THE NEW MANAGER 
PASSING THE INSTRUCTION TO THE OLD 
MANAGER WE ALL KNOW THE DELAYS 
CURWEN THE PAPERWORK IS WRONG OR 
WHEN THE NEW MANAGER IS ADVERTISING 
A HIGH RATE SO THEY BECOME 
OVERWHELMED THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO 
BE A GUIDELINE FOR THAT PERIOD IT 
IS DAYS AFTER THEY HAVE SHOVED 
THE PAPERWORK TO THE NEW MANAGER 
THE PUSH ME PULL BUT CAMEL IF YOU 
ARE WHIPPING ONE THING ALONG AT THIRTY 
DAYS AND YOU SAY YOU TAKE AS LONG 
AS YOU LIKE WILL IT IS POINTLESS 
RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR 
INTEREST DURING THIS TIME 
I WOULD 
GUESS YOU LOSE IT 
THE INTEREST 
SHOULD BE PAID 
PREVIOUS ONE 
AND ON THE SWITCH DATE IT GOES TO 
THE NEXT ONE THE QUESTION IS OVER 
WHETHER YOU WILL BENEFIT FROM THE 
INCREASE RATE THAT'S ADVERTISED 
HE ISN'T THE ONLY ONE OTHERS HAVE 
HAD THIS SITUATION 
THIS IS WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN TOLD IN THE BRANCH 
I SUPPOSE 
THE THING IS DO YOU HAVE A TIP IF 
I THEREON YOU TO BE HONEST I 
WOULDN'T BE BOTHERED WHEN YOU 
CHANGE ANYTHING THERE'S ALWAYS AN 
INSTITUTION TELLING YOU SORRY IS 
IT'S SIXTY DAYS YOU SAID IT WAS THIRTY L. 
WOULD IMAGINE UNTIL THE DUST 
SETTLES UNLESS YOU IT WOULDN'T BE 
TORTURED BY THESE OFFICIALS AND THE 
RATE IS BE PENAL WILL SIT ON THEIR 
HANDS 
THE SITUATION AT THE MOMENT HANDS DON'T TRUST WHAT YOU WERE TOLD IN 
THE BRAFRPBLGT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO 
CHICK ANOTHER WAY WITH LLOYDS T. S. B. 
THEY WILL GUARANTEE THE RATE 
ADVERTISED HOWEVER LONG THE TIME 
TAKEN TO TRANSFER THE MONEY BUT 
THE NATIONWIDE WILL ONLY GIVE YOU 
THE RATE ONCE THEY GIVE YOU YOUR 
CASH THE HALIFAX WILL DON'T TRUST 
WHAT YOU ARE TOLD IN THE BRAFRPBLGT 
CHECK ON THE INTERNET RING UP IF 
NECESSARY 
BUT BE PREPARED FOR SIXTY NECESSARY DAYS IN THE TIME BEING

ITS SUCCESS THE WINDERMERE STORE 
IS THE SECOND BIGGEST TOURIST 
ATTRACTION IN THE LAKE DISTRICT 
SHOPPER DOROTHY FROM NORTHERN 
IRELAND IS ON A VISIT TO THE LAKES 
AND CALLED INTO THE STORY WITH A 
SHOPPING LIST FROM HER FAMILY I I CONTACTED MY NIECE AND SAID IS 
THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE AT 
LAKELANDS SHE GAVE ME A LIST AND I 
DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO BRING 
IT HOME ON THE PLANE 
WHAT HAVE YOU 
BOUGHT 
I BOUGHT THIS HERE THAT BOUGHT THAT COULD BE VERY HANDY A DIGITAL 
LUGGAGE 
YES I MIGHT NEED IT FOR LUGGAGE GOING HOME TOMORROW L. L. HAVE A 
BROTHER WHO SEEMS TO HAVE NEARLY 
EVERYTHING I THOUGHT THIS IS NEW 
WHAT ELSE SILICONE MITS 
I USE THE 
MICROWAVE A LOT THAT WOULD BE 
HANDY ALL YOU DO WITH A LITTLE 
MAGNET IT CLINGS TO THE SIDE OF THE 
MICROWAVE 
BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE MICROWAVE STORE IS THE COMPANY'S MAIN OFFICE 
HERE STAFF DEAL WITH CATALOGUE AND 
INTERNET SALES AND THERE'S A TWENTY FOUR 
HOUR TELEPHONE SERVICE TOO WHERE 
OPERATORS HAVE THE GOODS HANDY TO 
MAKE IT EASIER TO EXPLAIN TO 
CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE HAVING PROBLEMS 
WITH THEIR PURCHASE THE COMPANY 
HAS THIRTY FIVE STORES AND FOURTEEN HUNDRED STAFF AND 
SAYS IT'S WELL PLACED TO DEAL WITH 
AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN BECAUSE THAT 
USUALLY MEANS PEOPLE CUTTING 
SPENDING BY RETURNING TO HOME 
BAKING AND USING THE KIND OF 
PRODUCTS ON SALE HERE IN FACT 
TURNOVER ROSE BY TEN PER CENT LAST YEAR TO 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION THE COMPANY IS COY 
ABOUT ITS LATEST FIGURES BUT SAID 
IT HAD A GOOD CHRISTMAS AND THE 
FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR 
HAVE BEEN STRONG IT ALSO HAS PLANS 
TO OPEN ANOTHER FOUR STORES AROUND 
THE COUNTRY AS THE LAKELAND 
EXPANSION CONTINUES ON CONSUMING 
ISSUES TODAY WE'RE ANSWERING YOUR 
PENSIONS QUESTIONS ON THE SOFA OF 
KNOWLEDGE WELCOME MALCOLM MCLEAN 
FROM THE PENSIONS ADVISORY SERVICE 
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT LETTERS ON 
THE INSURANCE COMPANY WINDSOR LIFE 
THERE'S A BIG STORY HERE AN 
EXAMPLE HERE FROM PAUL MY MOTHER 
HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THE WINDSOR 
LIFE FIASCO MY FATHER DIED IN 
AUGUST SHE WAS DUE PART OF HIS TWO 
PENSIONS IT TOOK SIX MONTHS FOR MY 
MOTHER TO RECEIVE ANY PAYMENTS L. 
PHONED THE COMPANY NUMEROUS TIMES 
NOBODY RANG BACK L. EVENTUALLY 
WROTE A LETTER OF COMPLAINT L. 
RECEIVED A QUICK RESPONSE SAYING 
THEY WOULD INVESTIGATE MY COMPLAINT 
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED SINCE HAVE 
MANY PEOPLE BEEN CONTACTING YOU 
WE'VE HAD HUNDREDS OF CALLS ON THIS 
AND INDEED SOME FINANCIAL ADVISORS 
HAVE BEEN UP IN ARMS ABOUT THIS 
THAT THEY CAN'T CONDUCT THEIR 
BUSINESS THIS WAS A ZAFRPL WAITING 
TO HAPPEN IN MANY WAYS THEY'VE 
SEEN EXAMPLES IN THE PAST OF 
INSURANCE COMPANIES TAKING OVER 
OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES TAKING 
OVER THE BUSINESS WITH A VIEW TO 
MAKING ECONOMIES OF SCALE 
ECONOMIES OF SCALE ARE GREAT BUT 
THERE IS MINIMUM SERVICE THAT HAS 
TO BE PROVIDED AND FOR SOME REASON 
IT SEEMS WINDSOR LIFE HAS 
COMPLETELY UNDERESTIMATED THE SCALE 
OF THE BUSINESS THEY'VE TAKEN ON 
AND THE THING IS ALMOST IN MELTDOWN 
THE FIRM THEY TOOK ON WAS TOMORROW 
I BELIEVE 
IT WAS 
WHAT WHAT WE CAN 
TELL PAUL IS THAT THIS IS NOT A 
FUND PROBLEM THIS IS BACKOFFICE 
PROBLEM YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEY 
IT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEM BUT 
IT NEEDS TO BE SORTED OUT QUICKLY 
PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THEIR 
PENSIONS THROUGH ON TIME SOMETIMES 
THE VALUE OF THEIR FUND IS DROPPING 
AND THEY'RE THEREFORE LOSING OUT 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF WINDSOR LIFE 
SAID ON WORKING LUNCH OVER A WEEK 
AGO THAT HE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT 
PROPER COMPENSATION WOULD BE MADE 
TO PEOPLE WHO INCURRED FINANCIAL 
LOSS WE SHOULD HOLD HIM TO THAT 
PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO THAT AND AT 
THE POINT WHERE WE CAN'T REALLY 
HELP AT THE MOMENT TRYING TO GET 
PEOPLE INFORMATION BUT AT THE 
POINT WHERE THEY ARE CLAIMING 
COMPENSATION IF THEY ARE NOT 
GETTING WHAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO 
THEY CAN COME TO US AND WE CAN TRY 
TO HELP THEM 
LET'S BRING UP THE 
PENSIONS HELPLINE NUMBER ONE PIECE 
OF HELP IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET 
YOUR NUMBER THE SECOND THING IS 
THAT THERE'S GOING TO A DELAY WHEN 
THE DUST SETTLES COME TO YOU WE'LL 
PUT THE CASES TOGETHER AND COME 
AFTER THESE PEOPLE 
WE HOPE THE F. S. A. 
AT THAT POINT WILL CARRY OUT AN 
INVESTIGATION AND MAKE SURE THIS 
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN 
IF THE F. S. A. 
DON'T THEY MIGHT AS WELL GO INTO 
ONIONS THIS IS PENSION ON THE DATE 
PROMISED THIS IS A JOB FOR THE 
F. S. A. YES IT 
BE WORSE ED F. S. A. YES IT COULDN'T BE WORSE ED FROM THE INDIVIDUAL'S POINT OF VIEW 
LUCKILY WITH YOUR HELP WE'RE 
COVERING THIS FREQUENCY LEWIS HAS 
ANOTHER QUESTION I'M RETIRED I'M 
RECEIVING STATE PENSION AND PRIVATE 
ANEWT I STILL HAVE A RIGHTS 
PENSION CAN I TRANSFER A PROTECTED 
RIGHTS PENSION TO MY WIFE 
THE LAW 
DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO TRANSFER A 
PENSION DURING YOUR LIFETIME TO 
SOMEBODY ELSE EXCEPT IN ONE 
PARTICULAR SITUATION ON DIVORCE 
WHERE A COURT ORDER IS MADE 
ALLOWING WHAT THEY CALL PENSION 
SPLITING IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES 
YOU CAN'T DO IT IT'S ONLY ON DEATH 
OR DIVORCE AND I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND 
EITHER OF THOSE IN THIS CASE SO SO IT'S A NO YES 
KIERAN SAYS I WAS YES RELIABLY INFORMED WE NOW ONLY NEED 
THIRTY YEARS OF NATIONAL INSURANCE TO 
GET A STATE PENSION DOES IT HAVE 
TO BE THIRTY FULL YEARS OR IS THERE AN 
ALLOWANCE OF SICKNESS UNEMPLOYMENT 
ET CETERA 
FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN THE REDUCTION 
IS FROM FORTY FOUR YEARS FOR A MAN TO THIRTY 
YEARS THOSE ARE QUALIFYING YEARS 
WHICH MEANS YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE MADE 
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF NATIONAL 
INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS IN A 
PARTICULAR YEAR FOR IT TO BE A 
QUALIFYING YEAR AND THEREFORE COUNT 
TOWARDS THE THIRTY 
QUALIFYING YEAR DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY 
YOU HAVE TO PAY NATIONAL INSURANCE 
CONTRIBUTIONS EVERY WEEK OF THE 
YEAR IT VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR 
HOW MUCH YOU HAVE TO PUT IN BUT IT 
IS POSSIBLE TO MEET THAT WITHIN 
PERHAPS SIX MONTHS OR EVEN NINE 
MONTHS SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR 
EVERY WEEK IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE IN 
THE EVENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT OR 
SICKNESS IF YOU'RE GETTING 
INCAPACITY BENEFITS OR JOBSEEKER'S 
ALLOWANCE THEY QUALIFY YOU 
AUTOMATICALLY FOR WHAT IS KNOWN AS 
A CREDIT TOWARDS YOUR NATIONAL 
INSURANCE WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'RE 
TREATED AS THOUGH YOU'VE PAID THEM 
SO IN BOTH THOSE SITUATIONS THERE 
IS A SORT OF BACKDROP AS IT WERE 
A COMPENSATION FOR MISSING OUT 
NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTION 
PAYMENTS FIND OUT WHAT YOUR RECORD 
IS SEE IF THERE ARE ANY GAPS 
BEYOND THAT BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING 
YOU SHOULD BE COVERED AMAZINGLY AMAZINGLY IT'S ONE PHONE CALL AS A RULE TO 
FIND OUT YOUR RECORD YOU RING THEM 
UP THEY'RE OFTEN FRIENDLY I FOUND 
RING THEM UP AND GIVE MY NUMBER AND 
THEY SAY WELL DONE YOU'VE PAID TWENTY FIVE 
YEARS OR SOMETHING YES THERE IS 
A SLIGHT PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT 
GETTING INFORMATION OUT OF THEM 
BECAUSE OF A CHANGE IN THE COMPUTER 
SYSTEM BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING IT 
IS EASY THE ANSWER TO THIS 
GENTLEMAN'S QUESTION IS THAT THERE 
ARE WAYS YOU CAN PLUG GAPS IN YOUR 
RECORD YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY 
EVERYWHERE WE'LL PAUSE THERE FOR 
BREATH BREATH ADAM WILL JOIN US LATER AND THEN 
EVERYTHING WILL BE CLEAR 
ARE YOU 
BEING SARCASTIC 
BREAKING GOOD NEWS 
FOR THE MOMENT COURTESY OF OUR 
FOLLOWING SIMON'S CHAT ABOUT ISAS 
SHE SAID I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE 
HEART TO VIEWERS FOR WELL OVER A 
YEAR MY HUSBAND AND I HELD OFF 
TRANSFERRING OUR ICEAS BECAUSE WE 
HEARD ABOUT THE PROBLEMS 
TRANSFERRING THEM BUT WE DECIDED TO 
TAKE THE BULL BY THE HORNS AND 
LOOKED INTO TRANSFERRING OUR ABBEY 
ISA ONLY TO NATIONWIDE WE SPOKE TO 
THE PROVIDERS ABOUT OUR CONCERNS 
AND IN THE CASE OF THE NATIONWIDE 
WE BELIEVED WE SPOKE TO THE MANAGER 
HOW LONG DID THE TRANSFER TAKE 
UNDER TWO WEEKS THEY CAN DO SEND 
US YOUR GOOD NEWS AS WELL AS YOUR 
BAD ONE THERE IS A MAJOR SHIFT 
GOING ON IN THE WORLD OF MARKETING 
AND PRBG R. MONEY IS MOVING AWAY 
FROM THE T. V. TO INTERNET IN MANY 
CASES AND THERE'S MORE EFFORT GOING 
INTO THE HIDDEN PERSUADEERS TODAY 
P. R. WEEK IS LISTING ITS LIST OF TOP 
AGENCIES JOINING ME IS THE EDITOR 
DANNY RODGERS 
IS THERE SOMETHING A BIT UNDERHAND 
ABOUT THE WORLD OF P. R. AND I MEAN 
THAT IN THE SENSE THAT ADVERTISERS 
ARE UPFRONT ABOUT IT THEY PAY TO 
SELL YOU A MESSAGE SURELY THE 
POINT ABOUT P. R. IS THAT THE P. R. 
INDUSTRY ARE TRYING TO INFLUENCE 
CONSUMERS BUT WITHOUT REVEALING 
THEIR HAND WITHOUT SHOWING THEY'RE 
INVOLVED IN THAT MESSAGE 
I THINK 
THE P. R. CONSULTANTS THAT P. R. WEEK 
WRITES ABOUT WOULD ARGUE THAT JUST 
AS YOU GO TO COURT IF YOU'RE AN 
ORGANISATION OR INDIVIDUAL YOU 
WOULD EXPECT TO EMPLOY A LAWYER TO 
ARGUE YOUR CASE P. R. CONSULTANTS 
WOULD ARGUE THAT IF PEOPLE ARE IN 
THE MEDIA SPHERE OR PUBLIC SPHERE 
THEY DESERVE AN EXPERT TO ARGUE 
THEIR CASE 
THESE ARE COMPANIES 
NEED PEOPLE TO PUT THEIR MESSAGE 
OUT THERE BECAUSE IDIOTIC 
JOURNALISTS WOULDN'T PICK THEM UP 
OTHERWISE IT'S A 
BATTLE 
OF IDEAS OTHERWISE SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL EXPOSED IN 
THE GLARE OF PUBLICITY AND THEY 
NEED HELP AND ADVICE 
IT'S NOT JUST 
THAT THEY FEEL EXPOSED THEY'RE 
DESPERATE TO GET THAT EXPOSURE WE 
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FIVE PHONE 
IT'S NOT JUST ON THE NEWS THIS IS 
THE SUN AND IT'S ALL ABOUT THEY 
HAVE A BIG COLUMN ABOUT THAT 
YOU'VE HAD A LOOK THROUGH THE 
PAPERS TODAY AND TRIED TO SEE WHERE 
THE HAND OF THE P. R. PROFESSIONALS 
HAS BEEN HERE L. WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
THAT WAS OBVIOUS THAT'S A BIG P. R. 
COUP DO YOU KNOW WHO'S BEHIND 
THAT 
ASDA EMPLOYS AN AGENCY CALLED THAT FROID COMMUNICATIONS A VERY P. R. 
AGENCY TO PUBLICISE ITSELF THAT'S 
A CLASSIC STORY ABOUT ASDA SELLING 
EXTREMELY CHEAP PHONES WHICH 
POSITIONS ASDA AS THE CONSUMER'S 
FRIEND FRIEND DO YOU THINK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
WHETHER THIS WAS A GOOD OR BAD DEAL 
FOR CONSUMERS YOUR EXPERT VIEW IS 
THE DEAL IRRELEVANT THIS WAS ABOUT 
GETTING GOOD P. R. 
YES I THINK 
ALMOST CERTAINLY ASDA MUST LOSE 
MONEY ON A DEAL LIKE THAT HOWEVER 
THE MESSAGE THEY'RE SELLING PHONES 
FOR FIVE SENDS OUT A VERY IMPORTANT 
REPUTATION FOR ASDA WHICH IS THAT 
IT'S A PRICE LED SUPERMARKET AND 
HAS THE CUSTOMER AT ITS HEART.OK 
LET'S GO TO A BROADSHEET WE USED 
TO CALL THEM BROAD SHEETS THE 
GUARDIAN THIS IS STORY I 
WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT A P. R. COMPANY 
WOULDN'T HAVE HAD MUCH TO DO WITH 
IT'S GRANGEMOUTH IT'S GOT LARGE 
IN DEPTH ARTICLE ABOUT THAT YOU 
DID FEEL THE P. R. AGENCY PROBABLY DID 
HAVE HAND IN THIS 
I THINK IN THE 
CASE OF GRANGEMOUTH IT'S MORE A 
CASE OF INFORMING THE DEBATE SO 
WE KNOW THAT THE OWNER OF 
GRANGEMOUTH EMPLOYS AN AGENCY 
CALLED ZOO MEDIA WHO I DID SOME 
DIGGING AROUND THEY'RE SORT OF 
RAMPING UP THE DEBATE AND TELLING 
JOURNALISTS ABOUT THE WORST CASE 
SCENARIO THIS STRIKE THAT PUTS 
PRESSURE ON THE UNIONS TO SETTLE 
I'M FASCINATED TO HEAR THAT YOU 
THINK THAT MIGHT BE GOING ON BEHIND 
THE SCENES HOW MUCH OF THE PAPERS 
THE NEWS IN THE PAPERS T. V. AND 
RADIO THAT WE GET AS CONSUMERS IS 
INFLUENCED OR PUSHED BY THE P. R. 
INDUSTRY HAVE YOU ANY SENSE 
THERE'S A RECENT REPORT IN A BOOK 
CALLED FLAT EARTH NEWS BASED ON A 
SURVEY BY CARDIFF UNIVERSITY THAT 
SUGGESTED AROUND TWENTY PER CENT OF ALL STORIES 
IN THE QUALITY BROAD SHEETS WERE 
MAINLY OR SOLELY THE RESULT OF P. R. 
AGENCIES AND IN AROUND FIFTY PER CENT OR SIXTY PER CENT 
OF CASES P. R. AGENCIES PLAY A BIG 
PART 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT W. P. P.'S PART RESULTS EARLIER HOW IS THE P. R. 
INDUSTRY FACING THOSE TROUBLED 
TIMES YOU WOULD THINK THAT 
TROUBLED INDUSTRIES COULDN'T AFFORD 
THIS INDUSTRY 
P. R. INDUSTRY SEEMS TO 
BE DOING EXTREMELY WELL WE'VE 
PUBLISHED A MAJOR REPORT ON THE 
AGENCY WORLD AND THIS REPORT SHOWS 
OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS THE P. R. 
SPEND HAS GROWN BY BETWEEN FIFTEEN PER CENT AND 
TWENTY PER CENT THAT'S CERTAINLY BUCKING THE 
TREND OF THE WIDER ECONOMY YOU 
MENTIONED W. P. P. EARLIER IN THE SHOW 
MARTIN SOEN 
THE BOSS 
YES HE HAS 
BEEN SAYING FOR SOMETIME THAT P. R. IS 
GROWING MUCH FASTER THAN 
ADVERTISING WITHIN W. P. P. IT'S IT'S OBVIOUSLY GREAT SUCCESSFUL P. R. IS 
GREAT FOR THE CUSTOMERS WHO ARE 
PAYING P. R. AGENCIES IS IT GOOD FOR 
CONSUMERS TO HAVE A P. R. AGENCY AT 
ALL 
I THINK P. R. IS JUST PART OF THE ALL GENERAL FLOW OF IDEAS AND 
INFORMATION IN THE MEDIA AS I SAY 
ORGANISATIONS WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY 
DESERVE TO PUT THEIR CASE ACROSS 
FOR EXAMPLE THE CHEAP PHONES 
CUSTOMERS WOULDN'T NECESSARILY KNOW 
ABOUT IT HAD THE STORY NOT BEEN 
PLACED IN THE SUNGREAT 
TALKING TO 
YOU THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED 
MANAGERS AT THE CASH AND CARRY

OUR FRIDAY FOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE IS 
STILL HERE TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT 
ANNUITIES MIKE SAYS I HAVE TYPE TWO 
DIABETES I UNDERSTAND I CAN GET A 
THE INSURANCE COMPANY IS SAYING 
HERE WE DON'T EXPECT YOU TO LIVE AS 
LONG AS AN AVERAGE PERSON OR A 
PERSON WITH AVERAGE HEALTH MIGHT DO 
AND THEREFORE WE'LL GIVE YOU A 
BERATE IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET ONE 
EVEN IF YOU'RE A SMOKER IT MIGHT BE 
POSSIBLE TO GET A BERATE IT'S NO 
GOOD SAYING YOU STARTED SMOKING A 
WEEK AGO YOU HAVE TO HAVE BEEN 
SMOKING FOR TEN YEARS 
THERE ARE TABLES THE F. S. A. PRODUCES 
AND WE CAN GIVE A WEBSITE FOR THAT 
AND THE THING IS LET'S NOT BE 
SENTIMENTAL AN ANNUITY IS BETTING 
HOW LONG YOU ARE GOING TO LIVE L. 
WILL GIVE YOU THIRTY THOUSAND AND YOU SAY 
LOOK AT YOU YOU HAVEN'T GOT LONG 
I WILL GIVE YOU TEN GRAND A YEAR 
AND IF YOU THINK I'M GOING TO LIVE 
FOR EVER YOU WILL GIVE ME THREE 
GRAND A YEAR 
YOU ARE NOT TALKING 
ABOUT ME ARE YOU 
NO I WAS TALKING 
ABOUT ME 
AND THERE IS A REALITY 
CHECK HERE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES 
ARE TAKING A GAMBLE ON HOW LONG 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LIVE IF YOU 
ARE THE FORMER QUEEN MOTHER IF SHE 
HAD AN ANNUITY THEY WOULD MAKE A 
LOSS ON HER 
DID SHE EVER CALL L. I HAVE NO IDEA SHE DIDN'T COME 
THROUGH ON THE PHONE TO ME HER HER LOSS DAVID ROBINSON WILL BE SIXTY FIVE 
NEXT YEAR AND HAS TWO PENSIONS WITH 
DIFFERENT COMPANIES WILL 
ME ADVISING ME TOP VALUES 
AND THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE SHALL I 
GO TO A SPECIALIST ADVISER OR CAN 
DAVID FIND OUT THE BEST ONE YOU YOU CAN CHECK THESE TABLES AND SHOP 
AROUND FOR THE BEST DEAL HE WANTS 
TO USE A FINANCIAL ADVISER TO GET 
SPECIALIST ADVICE THAT'S A GOOD 
THING TO DO IN MOST SITUATIONS WE 
ARE WORKING ON WHAT WE CALL AN 
ANNUITY PLANNER WHICH WE ARE GOING 
TO PUT ON OUR WEBSITE NEXT MONTH 
IT IS FREE IT WILL TAKE PEOPLE 
THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES GETTING 
YOUR ANNUITY IS AN IMPORTANT 
DECISION TO GET THE RIGHT ONE AT 
THE RIGHT TIME AND THE RIGHT FIGURE 
WE'LL DO A PLAN AND PUT IT ON OUR 
WEBSITE NEXT MONTH 
YOU WERE 
RUNNING A PENSION CALCULATOR THAT 
PEOPLE IN THEIR THIRTIES AND FORTIES COULD 
SEE IF THEY WERE PUTTING ENOUGH BY 
IT WAS A PENSIONS AGE CALCULATOR 
FOR THE STATE PENSION THIS IS 
DIRECTED AT PRIVATE PENSIONS 
IS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF 
ANNUITY A VERY IMPORTANT DECISION 
ONCE YOU'VE HANDED OVER YOUR FUND 
AND GOT THE ANNUITY THERE'S NO 
GOING BACK 
A LOT OF PEOPLE BUY THE 
ANNUITY FROM THE COMPANY THEY GOT 
THEIR PENSION AND THAT'S OFTEN NOT 
A GOOD DEAL 
WE CAN'T SAY THAT 
OFTEN ENOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY OF 
PEOPLE DO THAT IT IS LETHARGY I 
THINK THEY GET THE OFFER AND TAKE 
IT THEY MUST SHOP AROUND THEY 
COULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN WHEN YOU HEARD SIMON AND PEOPLE TALKING 
ABOUT SHOPPING AROUND WITH THEIR 
ISAS IT IS VERY COMPLICATED LOOK LOOK AT OUR ANNUITY PLANNER IT MIGHT 
HELP 
JOHN RETIRED AND TOOK HIS HELP DIMENSION A TAX FREE SUM HE WAS 
HOPE TO GO TAKE A TACKSABLE LUMP 
SUM OF NINE GRAND AND WAS TOLD HE 
CAN'T DO IT AS THE TOTAL IS LARGER 
THAN 
THE AMOUNT ALLOWED WHAT HE IS 
WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT IS TRIVIAL PENSIONS 
WHICH AREN'T SMALL AT ALL IF THE 
VALUE OF ALL YOUR PENSIONS COMES TO 
LESS THAN SIXTEEN FIVE HUNDRED YOU CAN TAKE THE 
LOT IN CASH BUT HE HAS ANOTHER 
PENSION SO HE CAN'T USED THE 
TRIVIAL PENSION RULES WHAT 
TO DO WITH THOSE SMALL SUMS OF 
MONEY IS TAKE SOME OF IT IN CASH 
AND USE THE REST TO PURCHASE AN 
ANNUITY BECAUSE THEY ARE SO SMALL 
HE MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM AS 
INSURANCE COMPANIES NORMALLY WON'T 
NORMALLY GO BELOW FIVE THOUSAND IN ONE POT 
HE MIGHT CONSIDER TRANSFERRING THEM 
TOGETHER MAKING A BIGGER POT AND 
IF HE CAN GET A BETTER ANNUITY IF 
YOU WANT TO RING OUR HELPLINE AND 
TALK ABOUT THIS PLEASE DO WE'LL WE'LL BE BACK AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ON MONDAY HAVE A 
GREAT WEEKEND GOODBYE
