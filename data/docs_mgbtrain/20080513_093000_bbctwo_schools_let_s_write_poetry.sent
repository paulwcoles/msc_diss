DAY ONE AND IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT KIND OF POEM THEY WILL ALL HAVE TO WRITE 
DEAR MADDY 
WELCOME TO THE BIG SLAM ACADEMY 
YOUR CHALLENGE IS TO WRITE A POEM USING YOUR WILDEST IMAGINATION 
YOUR AIM IS TO PRODUCE A POLISHED PIECE OF POETRY 
WHICH YOU WILL PERFORM AT THE END OF THE WEEK 
YOUR POEM SHOULD USE WORDS IN AN INTERESTING PLAYFUL COMBINATION THAT WILL SURPRISE THE LISTENER 
ON HAND TO HELP YOU IS PAUL LYLES 
YOUR POET IN RESIDENCE WHO IS WAITING FOR YOU NOW 
IN THE WRITING ROOM 
WHERE YOU'LL FIND EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO HELP CREATE YOUR POEM 
SO GET STARTED AND GOOD LUCK 
AND IT'S STRAIGHT DOWN TO BUSINESS 
GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE IN BIG SLAM 
I'M GOING TO GET YOU TO CHANGE THE WORLD TO MAKE THE WORLD A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT PLACE 
WHAT IF WE WERE ALL BORN OUT OF PUMPKINS 
WHAT IF WE WERE ALL COVERED IN FEATHERS 
WHAT IF WE LIVED IN 
PHOTOGRAPHS 
TO GET THEIR IMAGINATIONS REALLY WORKING PAUL GIVES THEM THE TITLE WHAT IF 
AND ASKS THEM TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN SUGGESTIONS 
WHAT IF I LOOKED OUT MY WINDOW AND A FLOWER POPPED UP WITH A PRESENT 
WHAT IF WE HAD LIVED FOR A MILLION YEARS 
WHAT IF THERE WERE FIVE EYEBALLS ON A HUMAN BODY 
WHAT IF RAIN WENT MIAOW AND WOOF AND IT RAINED CATS AND DOGS 
THIS FIRST SESSION HAS PUT AUTUMN'S MIND AT REST 
PAUL MADE IT EASIER TO ME THAN I THOUGHT IT COULD BE 
COS AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY HARD TO THINK OF IMAGINATION 
BUT THEN HE MADE IT EASIER LIKE YOU CAN MAKE UP ANYTHING LIKE A PUMPKIN CAN TALK OR SOMETHING 
THAT SOUND MEANS THERE'S A POEM WAITING TO BE VIEWED IN THE CINEMA 
JABBERWOCKY BY LEWIS CARROLL 
FROM THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS AND WHAT ALICE FOUND THERE 
TWAS BRILLIG AND THE SLIGHTLY TOTHES 
DID GYRE AND GIMBLE IN THE WABE 
ALL MIMSY WERE THE BOROGOVES 
AND THE MOME RATHS OUTGRABE 
BEWARE THE JABBERWOCK MY SON 
THE JAWS THAT BITE THE CLAWS THAT CATCH 
BEWARE THE JUBJUB BIRD 
AND SHUN THE FRUMIOUS BANDERSNATCH 
HE TOOK HIS VORPEL SWORD IN HAND 
LONG TIME THE MANXOME FOE HE SOUGHT 
SO REST DID HE BY THE TUMTUM TREE 
AND STOOD A WHILE IN THOUGHT 
AND AS IN UFFISH THOUGHT HE STOOD 
THE JABBERWOCK WITH EYES AFLAME 
CAME WHIFFLING THROUGH THE TULGEY WOOD 
AND BURBLED AS IT CAME 
ONE TWO ONE TWO 
AND THROUGH AND THROUGH 
THE VORPEL BLADE WENT SNICKER SNACK 
HE LEFT IT DEAD 
AND WITH ITS HEAD 
HE WENT GALLUMPHING BACK 
AND HAS THOU SLAIN THE JABBERWOCK 
COME TO MY ARMS MY BEAMISH BOY 
OH FRABJOUS DAY CALLOOH CALLAY 
HE CHORTLED IN HIS JOY 
TWAS BRILLIG AND THE SLITHY TOTHES 
DID GYRE AND GIMBLE IN THE WABE 
ALL MIMSY WERE THE BOROGOVES 
AND THE MOME RATHS OUTGRABE 
JABBERWOCKY IS A KIND OF IMAGINATION POEM THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND 
LIKE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TO MAKE SENSE 
HE WENT GALUMPHING BACK I LIKE THAT WORD BECAUSE IT SOUNDS FUNNY 
IF YOU ARE GALUMPHING YOU WALK LIKE THIS 
IT'S NEAR THE END OF DAY ONE AND EVERYONE IS FEELING VERY POSITIVE 
I THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE A FUN POEM TO WRITE BECAUSE ERM YOU HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO ERM 
DESCRIBE IN YOUR POEM 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE BORING STUFF YOU CAN JUST WRITE THINGS THAT ARE WILD AND EXCITING 
AH A SPIDER 
DAY TWO AND WHAT'S IN STORE FOR OUR TEAM TODAY IT SAYS PUSH ME 
A POEM BY ME ROGER MCGOUGH 
CALLED THE SOUND COLLECTOR 
A STRANGER CALLED THIS MORNING 
DRESSED ALL IN BLACK AND GREY 
PUT EVERY SOUND INTO A BAG 
AND CARRIED THEM AWAY 
THE WHISTLING OF THE KETTLE 
THE TURNING OF THE LOCK 
THE PURRING OF THE KITTEN 
THE TICKING OF THE CLOCK 
THE POPPING OF THE TOASTER 
THE CRUNCHING OF THE FLAKES 
WHEN YOU SPREAD THE MARMALADE 
THE SCRAPING NOISE IT MAKES 
THE HISSING OF THE FRYING PAN 
THE TICKING OF THE GRILL 
THE BUBBLING OF THE BATHTUB 
AS IT STARTS TO FILL 
THE DRUMMING OF THE RAINDROPS 
ON THE WINDOWPANE 
WHEN YOU DO THE WASHING UP 
THE GURGLE OF THE DRAIN 
THE CRYING OF THE BABY 
THE SQUEAKING OF THE CHAIR 
THE SWISHING OF THE CURTAIN 
THE CREAKING OF THE STAIR 
A STRANGER CALLED THIS MORNING 
HE DIDN'T LEAVE HIS NAME 
HE LEFT US ONLY SILENCE 
LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME 
THE POEM MADE ME THINK OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT SOUNDS 
THAT YOU CAN HEAR ALL THE TIME 
BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY THINK OF HOW MANY SOUNDS IN THE WORLD THERE ARE 
LIKE THERE'S MILLIONS OF THEM 
IT'S GREAT SOMETIMES JUST TO KIND OF BLOCK OFF YOUR VISION AND JUST USE YOUR HEARING 
SEE IF YOU CAN THINK YOU CAN HEAR A SOUND THAT NOBODY ELSE MIGHT HEAR 
THE SOUND OF A TREE IS LIKE A SUMMER BREEZE BLOWING PAST MY HAIR 
THE SOUND OF A LEAF FALLING FROM A TREE SOUNDS LIKE A SECRET BEING TOLD 
THE SOUND OF A CLOUD MOVING IS LIKE A WHIPPING WHISTLE OF WIND 
IF YOU IMAGINE A PICTURE IN YOUR HEAD YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS AS WELL 
IT'S TIME TO BE THINKING ABOUT IDEAS FOR THEIR FINAL POEM 
SO THEY'RE ALL ON A MISSION FIND INSPIRING OBJECTS 
PUT YOUR ITEMS ON THIS TABLE GUYS 
FANTASTIC THINGS PUT 'EM ON HERE 
I'D LIKE TO HEAR ARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY YOU CHOSE THESE ITEMS 
I THOUGHT I'D BRING A JUVENILE PEREGRINE FALCON COS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO WRITE ABOUT 
AND ITS HISTORY AND HOW REAL IT LOOKS COS IT'S JUST STUFFED 
IT COULD LEAD INTO A POEM OF IMAGINATION AND EVERYTHING YEAH 
COS IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN STUFFED HAS IT 
I PICKED A SCARY MASK BECAUSE I WANT MY POEM TO SPOOK EVERYBODY ELSE 
AND THE MASK CAN COME ALIVE 
WHEN PEOPLE PUT IT ON IT STICKS TO THEIR FACE 
I CHOSE THE MASK COS IT'S FROM NUBIA WHERE MY PEOPLE IS FROM 
AND TO LIKE TO LEARN ABOUT HISTORY AND PLUS THE ABORIGINALS MADE IT 
I HAD A PINE CONE AND MADE IT REALLY IMAGINARY LIKE IT'S REALLY MAGIC 
AND SOMEONE PICKS IT UP AND WHEN SHE BRINGS IT HOME IT TALKS TO HER 
WILL THEY USE THESE OBJECTS IN THEIR FINAL POEMS 
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 
CHARLIE REALLY ENJOYED TALKING OVER HIS IDEAS WITH THE OTHERS 
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON YOUR OWN 
YOU'RE LIKE WHEN YOU USE YOUR IMAGINATION IT GETS A BIT STUCK 
BUT WHEN YOU'RE WITH OTHER PEOPLE YOU CAN JOIN TOGETHER 
DAY THREE AND CHARLIE HAS ANOTHER IDEA FOR HIS POEM 
I'VE GOT A GOOD IDEA FROM TOM THE PONY 
WHEN YOU GET ON HIS BACK HE'S LIKE MAGICAL AND CAN FLY OR SOMETHING 
BUT BEFORE HE CAN START WRITING THEY HAVE A VISITOR 
HELLO I'M KIT WRIGHT 
AND I'VE COME TO SAY TO YOU A POEM CALLED THE MAGIC BOX 
HERE WE GO 
I WILL PUT IN THE BOX THE SWISH OF A SILK SARI ON A SUMMER NIGHT 
FIRE FROM THE NOSTRILS OF A CHINESE DRAGON 
THE TIP OF A TONGUE TOUCHING A TOOTH 
I WILL PUT IN THE BOX A SNOWMAN WITH A RUMBLING BELLY 
A SIP OF THE BLUEST WATER FROM LAKE LUCERNE 
A LEAPING SPARK FROM AN ELECTRIC FISH 
I WILL PUT IN THE BOX THREE VIOLET WISHES SPOKEN IN GUJERATI 
THE LAST JOKE OF AN ANCIENT UNCLE 
AND THE FIRST SMILE OF A BABY 
I WILL PUT IN THE BOX A FIFTH SEASON AND A BLACK SUN 
A COWBOY ON A BROOMSTICK AND A WITCH ON A WHITE HORSE 
MY BOX IS FASHIONED FROM ICE AND GOLD AND STEEL 
WITH STARS ON THE LID AND SECRETS IN THE CORNERS 
ITS HINGES ARE THE TOE JOINTS OF DINOSAURS 
I SHALL SURF IN MY BOX 
ON THE GREAT HIGH ROLLING BREAKERS OF THE WILD ATLANTIC 
THEN WASH ASHORE ON A YELLOW BEACH 
THE COLOUR OF THE SUN 
I THINK THAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN SOME OF YOUR OWN POEMS CALLED THE MAGIC BOX 
ON THE SAME LINES 
UM CAN ANYBODY TELL ME A LINE THAT THEY PUT IN THEIR BOX MANDY 
IN MY MAGIC BOX I WILL PUT THE SPARKLE OF THE EARTH'S FIRST DIAMOND 
SHINING IN THE LIGHT 
IN MY MAGIC BOX I WILL PUT THE HEAT OF A TEASPOON 
THAT'S JUST MADE THE TEA 
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYBODY PUT THAT IN A POEM BEFORE 
THE HEAT OF A TEASPOON THAT'S JUST MADE THE TEA GOSH 
WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO WRITE THE MAGIC BOX 
I DID IT DELIBERATELY TO MAKE A SORT OF PATTERN THAT PEOPLE COULD USE 
IN MAKING THEIR OWN POEMS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE IMITATED COULD BE COPIED 
AND BECAUSE WE ALL LIKE MAGIC WE ALL LIKE THINGS THAT AREN'T QUITE REAL 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO HAVE A MAGICAL ONE 
BECAUSE THEN NO HOLDS BARRED 
DO YOU WRITE YOUR POETRY IN A CERTAIN TIME OR IN YOUR FREE TIME 
POETRY YOU KNOW IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU CAN WRITE AT ANY TIME 
I ALWAYS HAVE A NOTEBOOK ON ME I'VE WRITTEN ON THE TOP DECK OF THE BUS 
I GO FOR WALKS AND I TAKE A NOTEBOOK AND SOMETIMES I'LL WRITE SOMETHING DOWN 
YOU CAN ALWAYS DO IT ANYWHERE REALLY 
BUT I THINK KEEPING THIS NOTEBOOK IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING 
COS YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN AN IDEA'S GOING TO COME TO YOU 
HOW DO YOU START A POEM 
I QUITE OFTEN START WITH THE TITLE AND I PUT IT DOWN THERE 
AND SOMETIMES I HAVE A SUBJECT THAT I REALLY WANT TO WRITE ABOUT 
SOMETHING'S MOVED ME A LOT OR MADE ME LAUGH 
AND I WRITE A POEM BUT IT VERY OFTEN DOESN'T COME OUT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME 
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER TO WRITE SOMETHING REAL 
I DO SOMETIMES I THINK YOU CAN WRITE ABOUT REAL THINGS IN THE WORLD 
I MEAN YOU CAN WRITE ABOUT THAT TREE OVER THERE THAT WE CAN SEE 
BUT YOU CAN ALSO WRITE ABOUT A MAGIC TREE 
ONE THAT DOESN'T GROW IN THE REAL WORLD AT ALL GROWS SOMEWHERE ELSE 
I THINK WE CAN DO ANYTHING WE LIKE IN POEMS 
ANYTHING GOES PUT IN ANYTHING YOU LIKE 
THANK YOU KIT 
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME IT WAS LOVELY TO COME 
INSPIRED BY KIT THEY ALL GET ON WITH WRITING THEIR POEMS 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY CHEMRA HAS A DILEMMA 
I'VE GOT TWO POEMS BUT I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE TO PICK BECAUSE 
THERE'S ONE ABOUT A NUBIAN ABORIGINAL MASK WHICH IS VERY GOOD 
THERE'S ONE ABOUT A BLACK HOLE SUCKING UP MY GUTS 
I'M GONNA CHECK NOW WHICH ONE SHOULD I CHOOSE 
DAY FOUR AND CHEMRA HAS CHOSEN THE MASK AS HIS FINAL POEM 
AND BY THE END OF TODAY ALL THEIR POEMS WILL BE FINISHED 
BUT FIRST 
THE DOOR BY MIROSLAV HOLUB 
GO 
AND OPEN THE DOOR 
MAYBE OUTSIDE THERE'S A TREE 
OR A WOOD 
A GARDEN OR A MAGIC CITY 
GO AND OPEN THE DOOR 
MAYBE A DOG'S RUMMAGING 
MAYBE YOU'LL SEE A FACE 
OR AN EYE 
OR THE PICTURE 
OF A PICTURE 
GO AND OPEN THE DOOR 
IF THERE'S A FOG 
IT WILL CLEAR 
GO 
AND OPEN THE DOOR 
EVEN IF THERE'S ONLY 
THE DARKNESS 
TICKING 
EVEN IF THERE'S ONLY 
THE HOLLOW WIND 
EVEN IF 
NOTHING 
IS THERE 
GO 
AND OPEN THE DOOR 
AT LEAST 
THERE'LL BE A DRAUGHT 
THE CHILDREN PUT THEIR IMAGINATIONS TO WORK BY CREATING THEIR OWN VERSION 
THROUGH MY WINDOW I CAN SEE THE FIRE THAT'S NEVER BEEN LIT 
THROUGH MY WINDOW I CAN SEE THE COAT THAT'S NEVER BEEN WORN 
THROUGH MY WINDOW I CAN SEE THE CHAIR THAT NO ONE HAS EVER SAT ON 
THROUGH MY WINDOW I CAN SEE STUFF THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN SEE 
WITH THEIR IMAGINATIONS NOW ON FIRE THEY'RE PUTTING THE FINAL TOUCHES TO THEIR POEMS 
WITH A POEM YOU'RE JUST USING THE FEWEST WORDS 
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THOSE FEWEST WORDS DO THE MOST 
LOOK IN THOSE CORNERS OF YOUR IMAGINATION GUYS 
HAVE A LITTLE THINK ABOUT JUST TAKING IT A BIT FURTHER 
IS THERE A WORD THAT'LL DO THAT IS THERE SOMETHING YOU CAN CHANGE 
IS THERE A LINE YOU JUST WANNA SLIGHTLY ALTER 
I CHANGED SUCKED TO ABSORBED 
COS IT SOUNDS A BIT BETTER BRILLIANT 
SUCKED IS A VERY KIND OF ALMOST LIKE A VIOLENT WAY OF DOING SOMETHING ISN'T IT 
YOU SUCK SOMETHING UP IT'S VERY IMMEDIATE 
IF WATER'S GOING TOWARDS A SPONGE IT JUST FLOWS INTO IT AND DOESN'T COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK IF MY SOUL 
WAS GOING UP TO HEAVEN I'D RATHER HAVE IT ABSORBED UP THAN SUCKED UP 
WITH THEIR POEMS NOW FINISHED HOW ARE THEY ALL FEELING 
I'M VERY PLEASED WITH MY POEM BECAUSE IT TOOK THREE DAYS TO WRITE NEARLY 
IT WAS REALLY HARD SOMETIMES 
I'M QUITE PLEASED WITH IT BECAUSE EVERYONE THAT HAS READ IT HAS SAID TO ME THAT IT'S QUITE SCARY 
IT'S THE DAY OF THE PERFORMANCE AND THERE'S SOME LAST MINUTE ADVICE 
HANDY HINT 
VARY YOUR PACE VOLUME RHYTHM AND EXPRESSION TO PERFORM YOUR POEM POWERFULLY 
CHARLIE IS FIRST UP AND HERE'S AN EXTRACT FROM HIS POEM 
TOM THE PONY IS SO MYSTERIOUS AND HIS SMILE IS VERY SERIOUS 
TOM DREAMS OF FLYING HIGH 
LIKE A KITE A FALCON OR EVEN A MAGPIE 
TOM IS ASCENDING THROUGH THE AIR QUICKER THAN THE FASTEST HARE 
PAST THE CLIFFS AND ON HE GOES 
STEERING AND BOLTING IN HIS LATEST POSE 
HE SPOTS THE STABLES ON THE FARM 
AND FLIES DIRECTLY INTO THEM WITHOUT ANY HARM 
I LIKE THE ACTIONS THAT CHARLIE USED BECAUSE IT'S LIKE EVERY 
LINE WHERE SOMETHING HAPPENS HE HE DOES THE ACTIONS 
AND AUTUMN IS NEXT WITH THE MAGIC SKY DOOR 
IMAGINE OPENING A DOOR THAT LED TO THE SKY 
YOU'D BACK FLIP INTO THE GOLDEN AIR 
UP A CLOUD STAIRCASE 
ENCRUSTED IN PURPLE DIAMONDS 
THAT SMELT LIKE THE SWEET SUGARNESS OF CANDYFLOSS 
THE PATH I WALK LEADS ME TO AN ANGEL THAT LOOKS LIKE A RAINBOW BUTTERFLY 
SHE TAKES MY HAND AND LEADS ME TO A WATERFALL MADE OUT OF HOT CHOCOLATE 
WITH FLUFFY MARSHMALLOWS BOBBING IN THE BUBBLES 
AND SHE WHISPERS IN MY EAR 
I LIKED AUTUMN'S POEM ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE WAS UM 
DESCRIBING UP IN HEAVEN AND HOW SHE WAS DESCRIBING IT BY CANDY 
AND HOT CHOCOLATE AND STUFF I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY GOOD 
CHEMRA IS PLEASED WITH HIS POEM AND IS EAGER TO PERFORM 
I'M THE NUBIAN ABORIGINAL MASK 
DON'T BE ANXIOUS 
I MAY SHOCK YOU BUT I'M VERY CARING 
I GIVE YOU LIFE INSTEAD OF DEATH 
I GIVE YOU CLEVERNESS INSTEAD OF STUPIDITY 
I GIVE YOU BLISS INSTEAD OF SCORN 
I'LL GIVE YOU A ADMIRATION INSTEAD OF BITTERNESS 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A REALLY GOOD POEM 
IT WAS REALLY SHORT BUT REALLY EFFECTIVE 
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS MADDY 
DARK AT NIGHT 
AS DARK AS A BLACK CAT AND A SORE THROAT 
THE MASK SITS LIT UP STARING BACK 
LIKE A TRAFFIC LIGHT THAT NEVER CHANGES 
I PICK IT UP AND SLOWLY MOVE IT TO MY FACE 
IT'S GLUED TO MY FEATURES 
SUDDENLY BANG IT'S STUCK 
STUCK LIKE A BATTLESHIP GLUED TO A GIANT MAGNET 
I CAN'T GET IT OFF 
MY WORLD IS DARK 
DARK AT MIDNIGHT 
IT WAS REALLY GOOD AND IT SET A REALLY NICE ATMOSPHERE 
THEY ALL CAME UP WITH SOME GREAT PIECES OF WRITING 
THAT ARE JUST A DELIGHT TO HEAR 
THAT'S A WRAP THAT'S A WRAP
