HER FAMILY HAVE OUTGROWN THEIR CURRENT HOUSE AND THEY'RE LOOKING TO GO LARGE 
RUNNING A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS SHOULD MEAN A BETTER LIFESTYLE 
A NEW CAR GOING OUT ENTERTAINING 
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT WHERE YOU LIVE 
FINDING THE RIGHT HOUSE CAN BE HARD 
IT'S THE BIGGEST PURCHASE YOU'RE LIKELY TO MAKE 
OUR HOUSE HUNTERS TODAY WANT A LOT FOR THEIR CASH 
AND THEIR BUDGET IS LIMITED 
WE'RE IN BIRMINGHAM SHOWING OUR BUYERS THREE PROPERTIES 
IN THE HOPE ONE MEETS THEIR HIGH STANDARDS 
BEFORE THEY MAKE THEIR DECISION WE'LL EVEN GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO TRY BEFORE THEY BUY 
THIS IS JACKIE KEATING AND THIS IS HER PET SNAKE SYBIL 
JACKIE'S LIVED IN HER STARTER HOME FOR SIX YEARS WITH HUSBAND EDDIE AND TWIN TEENAGE SONS 
AND YOU'VE GUESSED IT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE BIGGER 
EDDIE IS FAR TOO BUSY WORKING TO HOUSE HUNT 
SO SISTER TINA IS OUR SECOND PAIR OF EYES 
SPACE IS A PREMIUM SO THE SISTERS ARE LOOKING FOR MORE OF IT 
THEY WANT ROOM TO RELAX AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES 
JACKIE WANTS A HOUSE IN THE BIRMINGHAM AREA 
AS THE SHOP THEY OWN IS SOUTH OF THE CITY WE ARE CONCENTRATING OUR SEARCH IN YARDLEY 
JACKIE HAS VERY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR HER NEW HOME BUT ARE THEY REALISTIC LET'S FIND OUT 
JACKIE AND TINA WE HAVE SISTERS ON A MISSION 
DEFINITELY WHAT'S THE STORY JACKIE 
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A PROPERTY THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS COMING ON TWO YEARS NOW 
VISITED LOADS OF PROPERTIES ALL OVER THE MIDLANDS 
WE MUST HAVE DONE ROUND ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN RUGBY 
THEN WE WENT OVER TO NUNEATON AND DONE ANOTHER FIFTEEN TWENTY ROUND THAT AREA 
IN TOTAL HOW MANY DO YOU RECKON ABOUT 
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY IN TWO YEARS AND WE'VE GOT A DAY YEAH O. K. 
YOU'VE LOOKED AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR 
I'M LOOKING FOR A COUNTRY STYLE PROPERTY 
DETACHED SEMI DETACHED IT DOESN'T MATTER 
IT'S GOT TO HAVE AT LEAST THREE BEDROOMS GOT TO HAVE A NICE SIZED GARDEN COS I'VE GOT BOYS 
THEY'VE GOT A SWIMMING POOL SO I FEEL THE GARDEN YOU'VE GOT A SWIMMING POOL 
YES ABOVE GROUND FIFTEEN F. T. HEATED SWIMMING POOL 
WE'RE GONNA NEED A RUGBY PITCH DEFINITELY 
BIGGER THE BETTER THE GARDEN 
THE PROPERTY HAS GOT TO BE 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT'S GOT TO HAVE CHARACTER 
YES CHARACTER SOMETHING DIFFERENT YEAH 
I GET THE FEELING YOUR SISTER'S A HARD WOMAN TO PLEASE IS SHE FUSSY 
YES EXTREMELY 
I GET THE FEELING SHE'S NOT EASY TO PLEASE NO 
WHAT'S THE THING THAT'S BEEN WRONG WITH THE PROPERTIES 
WHAT ARE YOU NOT FINDING THERE'S NO CHARACTER 
YOU WALK IN A PROPERTY AND THEY'RE ALL THE SAME 
I'M HOPING 
WE CAN FIND SOMETHING YES YES 
IF WE FIND SOMETHING THAT MAYBE HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR CHARACTER 
ARE YOU UP FOR A BIT OF GRAFT 
COSMETIC MORE SO THEN KNOCKING DOWN WALLS AND PUTTING WALLS BACK UP 
YOU'VE LOOKED IN A WIDE AREA WHERE DO YOU WANT US TO LOOK 
WITHIN A HALF AN HOUR TO FORTY MINUTE DRIVE OF BIRMINGHAM 
ALL RIGHT THEN HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY CAN WE SPEND 
IDEALLY TWO HUNDRED TEN AT A PUSH TWO HUNDRED TWENTY 
O. K. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY WE'LL TAKE THE PUSH 
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'VE GOT OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US IF YOU LOOKED AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
WE'VE GOT TO FIND THREE REAL CRACKERS 
DEFINITELY WHAT A CHALLENGE WE SHALL SEE YOU A BIT LATER ON 
LOVELY O. K. 
NOW THIS IS VERY INTERESTING 
SHE'S SEEN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PROPERTIES IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND SHE HASN'T FOUND IT 
WE HAVE TO FIND HER DREAM HOME IN ONE DAY 
SHE ONLY WANTS THREE BEDROOMS AND CHARACTER SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT 
HOWEVER LOCATION WISE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BIT OVER EXCITED 
SHE WANTS TO BE FORTY MINUTES FROM BIRMINGHAM BUT I DON'T THINK SHE CAN LOOK TOO FAR OUTSIDE 
I'LL TRY TO FIND THAT CHARACTER PROPERTY YOU CHECK OUT THE LOCAL CHARACTERS SEE YOU LATER 
SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT YARDLEY 
IT'S IN THE SOUTH EAST OF BIRMINGHAM WITH ACOCKS GREEN AND SOLIHULL CLOSE BY 
IT'S COMMUTER BELT TERRITORY AND IN RUSH HOUR IT CAN TAKE UP TO 
FORTY MINUTES TO DRIVE THE FOUR MILES INTO THE CITY CENTRE 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF SCHOOLS AND TRANSPORT LINKS INCLUDE 
THE WEST COAST MAINLINE RAILWAY AND BIRMINGHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT JUST TEN MINUTES AWAY 
YOU CAN EXPECT TO PAY BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR A THREE BEDROOM SEMI HERE 
A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE COULD SET YOU BACK FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WHICH MEANS FINDING THE RIGHT HOUSE WILL BE A HUGE CHALLENGE 
WHILE WE EXPLORE YARDLEY AND THE SURROUNDING AREA 
LET'S SEE WHAT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND WOULD BUY ELSEWHERE 
HERNE IN NORTH KENT IS WHERE THIS TWO BEDROOM TRADITIONAL VILLAGE PROPERTY IS SITUATED 
NOT QUITE TO JACKIE'S SPECIFICATION BUT IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
THE DELIGHTFUL COASTAL VILLAGE OF COOMBE MARTIN FEATURES MY FAVOURITE 
MORE THAN FOUR BEDROOMS AND FULL OF CHARACTER 
AND IT'S AFFORDABLE AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
I'M TEMPTED BY THIS STYLISH WHARF SIDE APARTMENT IN CHESHIRE 
IT BOASTS ALL THE MOD CONS FOR JUST TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
BUT IT'S THE SOUTH OF BIRMINGHAM AND NEARBY SOLIHULL 
WHERE WE ARE CASTING OUR NET 
HI I'VE GOT YOUR ADVERTISEMENT HERE AND I'M LOOKING FOR A PROPERTY AROUND TWO HUNDRED TEN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY 
THREE BEDROOMS IS AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM 
THEY'D LIKE A GARDEN OFF STREET PARKING 
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
THE CLIENT I'M LOOKING FOR WANTS WOW AND CHARACTER CHARACTER 
WITH CHARACTER THAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT IN SOLIHULL 
THOUGHT SO YOU'RE NEEDING TO DOUBLE THE BUDGET PRICE 
THERE SEEM TO BE A HECK OF A LOT OF NINETEEN THIRTIES PROPERTIES FOR SALE 
WE'VE GOT SEVERAL PROPERTIES WITHIN THEIR PRICE RANGE 
THIS ONE'S NICELY CONVERTED GIVING AN OPTIONAL FOURTH BEDROOM 
HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING WOW 
THAT'S QUITE A NICE PROPERTY IT'S A GOOD SOLID PROPERTY 
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S HAD CHARACTER TAKEN OUT 
POTENTIALLY YOU CAN PUT IT BACK IN YOU CAN PUT IT BACK IN 
NOT REALLY SAYING WOW TO ME 
THERE'S ONE THAT'S INTERESTING 
THAT NEEDS BIT OF WORK THIS IS ONE OF THE ONES IN THE WINDOW 
THAT'S IN A SIMILAR LOCATION WELL WITHIN PRICE BUDGET 
O. K. WHICH ONE 
THIS ONE'S COME BACK ON THE MARKET A REALLY NICE CORNER PROPERTY 
IT'S GOT A SMALL REAR GARDEN BUT THE FRONT GARDEN COMPENSATES 
I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN NOW WHILST THESE HAVEN'T GOT LOTS OF KIND OF CHARACTER FEATURES NOW 
THEY'RE SOLID PROPERTIES THAT YOU COULD ALMOST MOVE BACKWARDS AND KIND OF GET IT IN 
YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH TO BE GETTING ON WITH 
I THINK I'M QUITE CLOSE ALL RIGHT O. K. I'LL POP IN 
SEE YOU IN A BIT ALL RIGHT BYE 
FINDING A CHARACTER PROPERTY IN THE AREA HAS BEEN HARD 
BUT AFTER WRESTLING WITH PROPERTY DETAILS AND ESTATE AGENTS 
WE DO HAVE A SHORTLIST 
THEY'RE ALL JUST SO 
REALLY OH THANK YOU THANK YOU 
THEY'RE ALL JUST THE SAME REALLY AREN'T THEY 
FOR HER BUDGET YOU WON'T FIND CHARACTER 
WE'VE SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW 
I MEAN THERE ARE SO MANY NINETEEN THIRTIES PROPERTIES 
WHICH ARE CHARACTER PROPERTIES BUT NOTHING DIFFERENT 
I STILL QUITE LIKE THIS ONE YOU KNOW YEAH 
BECAUSE I KNOW IT HASN'T GOT A LOT OF CHARACTER BUT IT COULD DO 
IF WE'RE GOING DOWN THAT ROUTE THEN I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THAT ONE 
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S NOT MASSIVELY DIFFERENT BUT I LIKE THIS 
I KNOW YOU ALWAYS LIKE THAT AND I LIKE THIS BIT 
THE POTENTIAL AS WELL I THINK SHE'S GOT THERE 
I THINK THAT MAY BE A GOER 
HOW ABOUT WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO 
BACK ON THAT ONE YEAH 
M. M. M. H. M. M. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK NO CAN WE RISK IT 
THIS IS AS WILD AS WE'LL GET IT IS AS WILD AS WE'RE GONNA GET 
RIGHT GO FOR THOSE THREE LET'S GO TO PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
NOW PROPERTY ONE IS MY CHOICE 
IT'S A RECENTLY EXTENDED THREE BEDROOM SEMI DETACHED HOUSE 
A GARAGE AND OFF STREET PARKING MAKE AN IMPRESSIVE PACKAGE 
IT'S ALSO LESS THAN TWO MILES FROM YARDLEY 
FIRST PROPERTY OF THE DAY IS MY CHOICE 
WHAT I'VE FOUND FOR YOU IS A THREE BEDROOM SEMI 
NOW I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU IT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF T. L. C. 
IT'S GOT PLENTY OF SPACE WHICH IS GREAT FOR YOU 
AND I THINK IT COULD BE A REALLY GOOD PLACE FOR YOU TO BE 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS UM 
OH SIMON IT'S GOING DOWN SO WELL 
IT'S VERY TRADITIONAL TRADITIONAL THIRTIES 
LIKE THE REST OF THE ROAD THE REST OF THE ROAD TINA 
I DON'T THINK JUST LOOKING AT THE OUTSIDE IT'S NOT HER CUP OF TEA 
BUT WE'LL LOOK INSIDE AND SEE WHAT'S WHAT 
I THINK YOU'RE BEING A BIT HARSH LADIES 
IT HAS AS YOU SAY RECENTLY BEEN EXTENDED 
AND DONE UP SO YOU KNOW WHEN THINGS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN DONE 
THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH CHARACTER INITIALLY BUT IT WILL DEVELOP 
IT'S A NICE SIZE YOU GET A LOT FOR YOUR MONEY RIGHT O. K. 
I THINK GIVE IT A CHANCE YEAH WON'T DISMISS IT GOOD 
DEFINITELY I'LL LOOK AT ANYTHING GOOD GOOD 
GET INSIDE AND HAVE A GOOD LOOK ROUND O. K. 
I THINK YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE SIMON 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE AND COUNTING 
I KNOW THE FIRST SIGNS AREN'T POSITIVE 
BUT LISTEN ON THESE HEADPHONES THEY'LL LOVE THIS ONE 
CARPETED 
RIGHT IT'S QUITE A SMALL ENTRANCE 
YEAH VERY SMALL ENTRANCE ISN'T IT 
IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN HER CURRENT HOUSE IT IS 
THIS IS THE FRONT ROOM 
NICE COSY LITTLE ROOM 
WE KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN WHEN THEY SAY COSY IT IS COSY 
YOU WOULDN'T GET YOUR TELLY IN HERE I DON'T THINK I WOULD WOULD I 
THERE'S NOWHERE TO PUT THE TELLY REALLY 
DEPENDS HOW BIG YOUR TELLY IS 
AND THIS NEXT ONE 
OH IT'S THE SAME SIZE AS THE FRONT ISN'T IT YEAH 
THE KEY TO THIS IS DEFINITELY POTENTIAL 
SHE'S REALLY GOT TO USE HER IMAGINATION HERE 
YOU'VE GOT THE POTENTIAL THOUGH IF YOU DECIDED TO DO THE WORK 
TO KNOCK THAT WALL RIGHT OUT 
YEAH AND HAVE A THROUGH LOUNGE THROUGH LOUNGE WITH EVERYTHING 
I SUPPOSE THIS WOULD BE THE DINING ROOM 
THAT WOULD BE THE FRONT ROOM BUT YOU'D ONLY HAVE ONE RECEPTION ROOM 
I THINK TINA'S TRYING 
JACKIE'S THINKING THIS ISN'T WHAT I HAD IN MIND 
AND TINA'S GOING NO BUT GET THE MALLET OUT 
OH THIS IS A LOT NICER 
AH YES THIS SHOWS WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH A PROPERTY DOESN'T IT 
YOU KNOW HOW THEY'VE WORKED ON THIS ONE 
YOU COULD WORK THROUGH THE REST OF THE HOUSE 
I LIKE THIS KITCHEN DO YOU 
IT'S NOT LAMINATE IT'S REAL IT IS REAL WOOD 
IT'S A NICE BIG KITCHEN 
NICE SIZE BREAKFAST BAR 
YEAH YOU COULD HAVE THE BOYS THERE AND EVERYTHING EXACTLY 
IT'S A NICE KITCHEN 
IT'S A NICE SIZE 
YEAH IT'S A NICE VIEW 
AND THE GARDEN 
NEEDS A LOT OF WORK DOESN'T IT 
THE GARDEN DOESN'T JUST NEED A LOT OF WORK IT NEEDS 
IT NEEDS TO BE TURNED INTO A GARDEN 
YOU COULD DO PATIOS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
IF YOU DID WANT TO DO ANYTHING ELSE TO THE HOUSE EXTEND IT FURTHER 
YOU CAN DO IT THEN DEAL WITH THE GARDEN RATHER THAN RIPPING UP SOME GREAT CREATION 
OH THESE ARE STEEP 
O. K. THEY'RE STEEPISH BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU 
ANYTHING BUILT PRE NINETEEN FORTY HAS FAIRLY STEEP STAIRS 
VERY STEEP WATCH THE CORNER 
WE'VE REALLY GOT OUR WORK CUT OUT TODAY 
I KNOW IT'S YOUR FAULT 
THIS IS THE BACK ROOM 
IT'S PLEASANT OH THAT'S ONE OF THOSE WORDS THAT REALLY 
I THINK PLEASANT IS A WORSE WORD THAN NICE FOR ME 
IT IS IT'S OH SO POLITE YEAH 
AGAIN NEEDS UPDATING DOESN'T IT 
NICE SIZE THOUGH ISN'T IT 
DID YOU HEAR THAT YEAH 
THAT NUGGET OF POSITIVE NICE SIZE OH 
WHAT'S IN HERE 
IT'S THE BATHROOM 
YEAH NICE NICE SIZE BATHROOM 
AND IT'S ALL FULLY TILED AS WELL 
THAT'S NICE EASY FOR CLEANING ISN'T IT 
SIMON IT'S COMING TOGETHER FOR YOU NOW 
COME ON GIRLS COME ON 
O. K. 
SHALL WE GO IN THIS ONE YEAH 
OH LOOK FITTED WARDROBES COMPLETELY ALONG THE BACK WALL 
AGAIN IT'S A FAIR SIZE ISN'T IT 
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE AS THE SITTING ROOM BELOW BUT THEY WENT THIS IS SMALL YEAH 
IT'S A FAIR SIZE AND TAKING FITTED WARDROBES 
COS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH ROOM THEY TAKE UP 
THAT'S IT YEAH PLEASANT ENOUGH ANYWAY 
DO YOU FEEL TINA'S DONE THIS A FEW TIMES 
YES TINA'S SOUNDING A BIT WEARY YEAH 
O. K. IS THERE ANY OTHERS 
OH YEAH OFFICE THIS WILL BE THE THIRD 
SMALL BOX ROOM 
GOODNESS IT IS SMALL OH IT IS SMALL 
IT'S A SMALL SINGLE BEDROOM 
WOULD YOU GET A SINGLE BED IN THERE LET ALONE ANYTHING ELSE 
THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME POTENTIAL HERE BUT IT'S THE HOUSE ITSELF 
YES IT'S ALL CARPETED FINE ISN'T IT NEW CARPETS DOWN 
I HOPE YOU HAD YOUR CEREAL THIS MORNING 
COS YOU'LL NEED ALL YOUR ENERGY FOR THIS ONE 
I THINK I'VE LEARNT SOMETHING FROM THAT TOUR 
I'M NOT CONVINCED WHAT YOU WANT IS CHARACTER 
WHAT YOU WANT IS DIFFERENT YES 
I THINK WITH THIS HOUSE YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE FULL POTENTIAL 
I THINK THIS COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT 
THIS KITCHEN IS A STARTING POINT RIGHT 
THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING O. K. IT'S A STANDARD KITCHEN 
BUT IT SHOWS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE HOUSE 
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO KIND OF KEEP ON THE POSITIVE 
SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU MENTIONED WAS THAT THE THIRD BEDROOM WAS A LITTLE BIT ON THE SMALL SIDE YES 
I AGREE WITH YOU 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE GARAGE EXTENSION AND THE KITCHEN 
THE FOUNDATIONS IN HERE ARE ADEQUATE FOR A TWO STOREY EXTENSION 
SO IF YOU WANTED YOU COULD BUILD UP OVER HERE BUILD ACROSS 
AND THEN YOU COULD EITHER EXTEND THAT SMALLER BEDROOM 
OR PUT A FOURTH BEDROOM ON IT WHICH MAKES IT A BIGGER PROPERTY YEAH 
IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO GO FOR IT THERE'S LOADS OF OFF STREET PARKING 
SO THIS ROOM COULD ACTUALLY BE ANOTHER ROOM 
AND IT COULD BE REALLY FUNKY DIFFERENT ROOM 
YOU COULD GO TO TOWN YOU'VE GOT A GREAT SQUARE SPACE YOU COULD STAMP YOUR IDENTITY ON 
RIGHT O. K. YOU'RE STILL UNCONVINCED 
WELL YOU'VE GOT THE PARKING OUT THERE SO IT'S OFF ROAD PARKING 
SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A PLUS THING IN THIS DAY AND AGE 
ERM 
AS TO HAVING TO DO A BIG EXTENSION COMPLETELY REDO THIS AS A ROOM 
IT'S A LOT OF TIME A LOT OF WORK A LOT OF MESS 
MAYBE THE PRICE MIGHT CONVINCE YOU 
LET'S GO AND FIND SARAH O. K. 
TINA I THINK THIS HOUSE IS ALL ABOUT POTENTIAL 
YEP DEFINITELY YOU AGREE WITH ME ON THAT ONE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT YEP 
THIS MAKES ME WEEP COS IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY 
I LOVE NINETEEN THIRTIES HOUSES THEY'RE VERY SOLID 
THEY'VE GOT SENSIBLY SHAPED ROOMS NICE AND SQUARE 
BUT THEN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES CAME AND SOMEBODY THOUGHT IT'D BE GREAT TO RIP OUT EVERYTHING 
THAT'S IT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIREPLACE BACK HERE 
YOU CAN HEAR THERE'S SOMETHING BEHIND THERE SOLID WALL UP HERE 
YOU COULD PUT BACK IN A FIREPLACE 
YES TAKE THAT BACK BETTER DECOR ON THE WALLS 
PUT BACK SOME LOVELY CORNICING NICE CEILING ROSE 
WHOEVER THOUGHT POLYSTYRENE TILES WOULD BE GOOD 
OVER HERE AGAIN THIS IS EVERYTHING I HATE ABOUT EXTENSIONS 
SOMEONE HAS JUST SLAPPED ON THIS UPVC FLOOR TO CEILING THING 
IT WOULD COST YOU A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY 
BUT I WOULD SAY GET RID OF THIS WHOLE AFFAIR HERE 
PUT IN SOME TIMBER FRAMED FRENCH WINDOWS YEAH 
THOSE OPENING OUT ONTO YOUR FRESHLY LANDSCAPED GARDEN 
OF COURSE YOU MENTIONED GETTING THE MALLET OUT DIDN'T YOU 
THAT'S THE ONE BETWEEN THESE ROOMS OVER THERE THAT'S WHAT I'D DO 
KNOCK THROUGH YOU WALK INTO THE RECEPTION ROOM 
STRAIGHT THROUGH LOVELY CHARACTER YOU'VE BROUGHT BACK 
AND OUT TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL GARDEN ARE YOU FEELING THE PASSION 
DEFINITELY WITHOUT A DOUBT THERE'S POTENTIAL 
DOES JACKIE SEES THE POTENTIAL 
SHE'S GOT TO HAVE THE LOOK SHE'S GOT TO HAVE THE WHOLE PACKAGE 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT'S TIME TO A GUESS THE PRICE RIGHT O. K. 
I'M GUESSING YOU'RE A BIT FRIGHTENED BY THE LADIES IN THEIR BLACK COATS 
THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE SINISTER AS TIME GOES ON 
THINKING CAPS ON HOW MUCH IS MY FANTASTIC THREE BEDROOM PROPERTY 
THAT YOU'RE NOT MASSIVELY IMPRESSED WITH ON THE MARKET FOR 
UM AREA IT'S IN I WOULD SAY ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
O. K. TINA 
SLIGHTLY UP ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE 
OH TINA YOU HAVE SNATCHED VICTORY FROM THE JAWS OF YOUR SISTER 
THERE YOU GO 
YOU ARE CLOSER BUT IT'S ACTUALLY TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE OOH 
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT 
THAT'S HUGE YEAH 
YOU'RE GETTING QUITE A LOT OF PROPERTY FOR YOUR MONEY THOUGH 
WITH THIS EXTENSION ON IT 
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO 
O. K. WELL ANYWAY HANG FIRE ON THIS ONE 
BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO MORE PROPERTIES DO YOU TRUST ME YES 
FABULOUS COS PROPERTY NUMBER TWO IS MY CHOICE 
IF JACKIE AND TINA GO FOR PROPERTY ONE THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THEY NEED TO BEAR IN MIND 
IF JACKIE HAS GREEN FINGERS THE GARDEN COULD BE A CHALLENGING PROJECT FOR HER 
IF NOT A PROFESSIONAL LANDSCAPING COMPANY 
WOULD CHARGE AROUND THE FIVE THOUSAND MARK TO BRING IT UP TO SCRATCH 
THERE'S BAGS OF POTENTIAL HERE FOR EXTENDING THE HOUSE 
BUT CONSTRUCTION WORK CREATES MESS AND STRESS 
JACKIE WILL HAVE TO BE SURE OF WHAT SHE WANTS 
BEFORE SHE EMBARKS ON BUILDING 
PROPERTY NUMBER TWO IS MY CHOICE AND TICKS ALL OF JACKIE'S BOXES 
IT HAS OFF ROAD PARKING THREE BEDROOMS A LARGE GARDEN AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND 
THERE'S ALSO PLENTY OF ROOM FOR JACKIE'S PET PYTHON 
I AGREE IT'S A SPACIOUS HOUSE WITH LOADS OF POTENTIAL 
IT COULD BE JUST WHAT JACKIE'S LOOKING FOR 
JACKIE WE DID HAVE QUITE A HARD TIME FINDING SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT 
FOR YOUR BUDGET WITH THE AMOUNT OF ROOMS YOU WANTED 
SO FROM THE OUTSIDE MY CHOICE DOESN'T LOOK DISSIMILAR TO SIMON'S 
BUT WHAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU IS A FANTASTIC CORNER PLOT 
WITH A LOVELY MATURE OUTLOOK WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WELL IT'S GOT A BIG ENOUGH DRIVEWAY 
FIT TWO THREE CARS ON GARAGE SIDE ENTRANCE 
SO THE KIDS DON'T HAVE TO RUN THROUGH THE HOUSE ETC 
WE'LL SEE 
O. K. TINA 
OH HO IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE HOUSE THAT WE'VE SEEN BEFORE 
RIGHT SIMON HELP 
WE ESTABLISHED WITH PROPERTY ONE YOU DON'T WANT CHARACTER 
WHAT YOU WANT IS DIFFERENT 
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO WHEN YOU GO INSIDE HERE IS 
EVERY ROOM THINK OF HOW YOU CAN MAKE IT DIFFERENT 
IF YOU GO IN WITH YOUR CREATIVE HEADS ON 
YOU MIGHT BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED 
BECAUSE AS WITH PROPERTY NUMBER ONE THIS HAS GOT BAGS OF POTENTIAL 
O. K. GO IN THERE AND LET THE CREATIVE JUICES FLOW 
FLOW OH I HOPE THEY FLOW 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO AND COUNTING 
SIMON I'M TRYING REALLY HARD TO BE CONFIDENT ABOUT THIS 
YOU AND ME BOTH GOOD LUCK 
THANK YOU 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE HALL ISN'T IT 
WHAT'S WRONG JUST HAD A REALLY REALLY TERRIBLE THOUGHT 
WHAT IMAGINE IF OUR ROLE WAS THAT WE HAD TO KEEP DOING THIS UNTIL JACKIE FOUND A PROPERTY 
SLIGHTLY BIGGER THAN THE LAST ONE ISN'T IT YES DEFINITELY 
ALL THIS HAS BEEN STRIPPED BACK HASN'T IT 
IT'S GOT A WARMER FEEL HASN'T IT YES IT HAS 
D'YOU KNOW THEY ARE EVEN QUIETER IN THIS HOUSE THAN THE LAST ONE 
QUITE SMALL ISN'T IT 
VERY SIMILAR TO THE LAST ONE YEAH 
IT'S A REAL FIRE 
YEAH AGAIN NEEDS 
A BIT OF UPDATING DOESN'T IT 
IT'S A NICE ROOM ACTUALLY 
OH THIS IS DIFFERENT ISN'T IT 
NICE ROOM 
BETTER ISN'T IT SLIGHTLY MORE QUAINT YEAH 
AGAIN GOT ALL THE WOOD THE ROOM'S BIG ENOUGH FOR YOUR TELLY 
YEAH IT WOULD HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE WOULDN'T IT 
STILL NEED TO DO LOTS OF DECORATING YEAH VERY MUCH SO 
THEY HAVE TO DO LOTS OF DECORATING SO 
I RECKON YOU COULD CHANGE THIS INTO A NICE CONSERVATORY AREA THOUGH 
DEFINITELY 
IT'S GOT MORE POTENTIAL HASN'T IT THAN THE OTHER HOUSE 
YEAH NICE SIZE GARDEN OH THERE'S A POND 
LOVELY GARDEN ACTUALLY REALLY NICE GARDEN 
THAT'S THE MAIN THING THAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS IT'S ON A MATURE PLOT 
IT'S A BETTER SIZE GARDEN AS WELL 
THE GARDEN IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM PROPERTY ONE ISN'T IT 
IN THAT THERE IS ONE YES 
WHAT'S THAT IN THERE 
BOILER ROOM RIGHT 
AGAIN THERE'S MORE STORAGE ROOM AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
YOU'D CHANGE THAT TO A COMBI BOILER WOULDN'T YOU 
IF I WAS JACKIE I'D BE LOOKING FOR A DIFFERENT BOILER 
A CHARACTER BOILER THE KITCHEN 
THAT'S A GOOD SIZE KITCHEN THOUGH NICE TABLE AND CHAIRS 
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING FITTED IN QUITE WELL HASN'T IT 
I LIKE THE DOORS OFF THE KITCHEN AND THAT AREA OUTSIDE THERE 
I THINK HAS GOT LASHINGS OF POTENTIAL 
SLIGHTLY MORE POTENTIAL YOU MIGHT SAY THAN YOURS 
THAT KITCHEN THERE HERE 
THE MORE MODERN UPDATED KITCHEN IN HERE 
COS THIS IS JUST LINO SQUARES ISN'T IT 
SHE CAN'T SEE PAST THE FACT THAT IT ISN'T DIFFERENT ENOUGH FOR HER 
VERY GLITZY AND GLAMOROUS 
A SMALL THIRD ROOM THIS'LL BE WOULDN'T IT 
IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'VE GOT BUNK BEDS IN HERE ISN'T IT 
YOU CAN LOOK RIGHT OUT OVER THE GROVE 
I LIKE THE VIEW OUT OF THIS HOUSE 
IT'S A PRETTY ROOM 
YEAH IT'S A GOOD SIZE THOUGH FOR A DOUBLE ROOM 
IT'S A NICE SIZE WITH THE FITTED WARDROBES 
ALL THESE WARDROBES HERE 
SLIDING MIRRORS YEAH THEY'RE NICE 
I'M CONFUSED I CAN'T DECIDE WHETHER WE'RE GRASPING AT STRAWS 
OR THEY ACTUALLY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT BOTH 
THEY'RE NOT FITTED 
AGAIN THIS IS A REALLY LOW 
LOW PART OF THE CEILING ISN'T IT 
THAT IS WEIRD THAT IN THAT FRONT BEDROOM 
IF I STAND RIGHT UP AGAINST IT I'M LIKE THAT 
YOU COULD DEFINITELY GET A DOUBLE BED IN HERE OR TWO SINGLES 
YOU'VE GOT STORAGE SPACE 
AND ROOM FOR YOUR WARDROBES 
THE BIG DIFFERENCE WITH YOUR HOUSE AND MINE IS THAT THIRD BEDROOM 
IS BIG ENOUGH SO THE TWINS CAN HAVE SEPARATE BEDROOMS YEAH 
HAVE A LOOK IN THE BATHROOM 
O. K. 
AGAIN ONE THAT'S RECENTLY BEEN DONE HASN'T IT 
BUT IT STILL NEEDS REPLACING DOESN'T IT THE GREEN BATH 
OH DEFINITELY SHE SAYS IT NEEDS UPDATING 
IT REALLY DOESN'T SHE WANTS IT DIFFERENT 
IF IT GETS UPDATED IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE'S BATHROOM 
MM YEAH 
O. K. RIGHT THEN THAT WENT SWIMMINGLY WELL 
LET'S GO AND 
SO AS FAR AS THE ACTUAL ACCOMMODATION ITSELF IN THIS HOUSE GOES HOW DID IT FEEL SIZE WISE 
THE ROOMS WERE OF AN O. K. SIZE 
THE DOWNSTAIRS WAS JUST A BIT MISMATCHED REALLY 
FOLLOW ME UP HERE 
MISMATCHED YOU SAID YOU WANTED DIFFERENT 
THE FRONT ROOM'S SMALL AND THE BACK ROOM'S ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND THEN IT GOES INTO THE KITCHEN AND 
IT'S QUIRKY IT'S NOT THE SAME AS YOUR NEIGHBOUR'S HOUSE 
YES DEFINITELY THAT'S TRUE 
DID IT FEEL BIG ENOUGH OR WERE YOU STILL AFTER A BIT MORE 
NO IT NEEDS TO BE BIGGER 
NOT A PROBLEM 
THE HOUSE HAS ALREADY BEEN EXTENDED ON THAT SIDE FOR THE KITCHEN 
THERE IS THE POTENTIAL AS WITH SIMON'S CHOICE TO ACTUALLY GO UP 
SO YOU COULD EXTEND THE UPSTAIRS AGAIN PUT A FOURTH BEDROOM 
AND MAKE THE BATHROOM A BIT BIGGER AT THE FRONT 
THAT'D GIVE YOU YOUR FOUR BEDROOMS YEP 
DOWN HERE THEY'VE ALREADY PUT ON A SORT OF CONSERVATORY BUT IT'S A BIT MORE OF A LEAN TO YES 
NOT VERY SOLID WHAT I'D BE TEMPTED TO DO GET RID OF ALL THAT AND PUT ON A REALLY SUBSTANTIAL ONE 
GIVE YOURSELF A LOVELY DINING ROOM THERE 
YEAH P. V. C. CONSERVATORY SLASH DINER 
EXACTLY LOVELY FRENCH DOORS OUT INTO THE GARDEN 
BEING A CORNER PLOT IF YOU WANTED TO DO ANY OTHER BUILDING OR EXTENSION WORK 
IT'S NOT AS TRICKY WITH NO IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURS 
TO GET PERMISSION FOR ANYTHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO 
SO THERE'S LOADS AND LOADS OF POTENTIAL HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I CAN SEE THE POTENTIAL YES 
AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN SWIMMING POOL AS WELL 
OH YEAH WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT 
I WANT ROOM FOR SWIMMING POOL TRAMPOLINE JACUZZI THINGS LIKE THAT 
YEAH YEAH YEAH WE ALL DO 
SHALL WE GUESS THE PRICE O. K. 
I WANT TO TRY AND DEMONSTRATE HOW EASY I THINK IT CAN BE 
TO MAKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT WHICH IS WHAT JACKIE WANTS 
OUT HERE THIS IS QUITE A BADLY USED AREA REALLY 
A BIT OF CONCRETE BIT OF BARE WALL IT LOOKS A BIT DULL 
BUT IT COMES OFF THE KITCHEN SO IT'S A FANTASTIC AREA FOR ALFRESCO DINING WITHOUT A DOUBT 
SO WHAT I'D DO DECK THIS AREA WHICH IS VERY CHEAP 
IT WON'T COST MUCH AT ALL THAT'LL BE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD 
THEN ONCE SHE'S DONE THAT LET'S THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THIS AREA 
I'M THINKING TROPICAL PLANTS NOT A HUGE EXPENSE I'M THINKING 
SOME OUTDOOR HEATERS THEY GET CHEAPER AND CHEAPER BY THE DAY 
SOME FUNKY LITTLE LIGHTS MAYBE SOME BLUE FAIRY LIGHTS TO BRING IT SOME DIFFERENT COLOUR 
BARBECUE AND ENTERTAINING AND EATING OUTSIDE AND PATIO HEATERS THAT'S THE SORT OF THING SHE LIKES 
BRILLIANT LOTS OF FAMILY AROUND AND LOTS OF THINGS HAPPENING 
SO WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WE JUST NEED TO TRY TO GET HER SEEING THIS POSSIBLY YES 
NOW PRICE WISE LET'S GO AND SEE WHAT WE RECKON THIS ONE'S WORTH O. K. 
SO THAT'S IT THE SECOND NINETEEN THIRTIES SEMI OF THE DAY 
I'VE GIVEN YOU DARE I SAY MORE SPACE THAN SIMON DID AND A FANTASTIC CORNER PLOT 
HOW MUCH IS IT JACKIE 
GOING ON THE LAST ONE IT'S A BIT BIGGER 
HAVE WE USED UP ALL YOUR BUDGET 
YES TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY RIGHT TINA WHAT DO YOU THINK 
UM TWO HUNDRED TWELVE 
TWO HUNDRED TWELVE WELL IT'S TWO TO ZERO TO TINA 
WO HOA 
THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY CHEAPER THAN PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
THIS IS ON AT TWO HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
MAYBE NOT QUITE AS BIG A PRIZE AS PROPERTY ONE WE'VE SEEN TWO THAT YOU'VE BEEN STUNNED WITH 
ONE MORE TO GO THE WILD CARD 
IT'S SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SOMETHING THAT SARAH AND I ARE VERY EXCITED BY COME THROUGH 
IF THIS PROPERTY MAKES AN IMPACT ON JACKIE AND TINA THERE ARE SOME THINGS THEY NEED TO BEAR IN MIND 
THE MATURE GARDEN IS VERY PERSONALISED 
AND COULD REQUIRE QUITE A BIT OF WORK CHANGING IT TO THEIR TASTE 
BUT IT'S LARGE AND THERE'S AMPLE ROOM FOR JACKIE'S SWIMMING POOL 
THE HOUSE HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL 
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM TO EXTEND PROVIDING YOU SORT OUT THE PLANNING PERMISSION 
IT CAN EASILY BECOME A VERY DESIRABLE FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE ON A CORNER PLOT 
THE NEXT PROPERTY IS OUR WILD CARD IT'S OUR JOINT CHOICE 
SET CLOSE TO SOUTH YARDLEY IT'S IN A QUIET ROAD AWAY FROM TRAFFIC NOISE AND CONGESTION 
WE'VE REALLY PUSHED THE BOAT OUT WITH THIS ONE 
JACKIE WON'T BE EXPECTING A FOUR BEDROOM DETACHED PROPERTY 
WITHIN HER BUDGET AND IN TRUTH SHE'S NOT GOING TO GET ONE 
OUR WILD CARD IS OVER HER BUDGET BUT WE THINK IT'S WORTH THE RISK 
INSIDE IT'S BEEN VERY NICELY EXTENDED LET'S FIND OUT IF JACKIE IS SOLD ON IT 
THE FINAL PROPERTY OF THE DAY IS THE WILD CARD 
IT'S OUR JOINT CHOICE SARAH AND I HAVE HUNTED AND SEARCHED FOR 
SOMETHING THAT LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAT LITTLE BIT EXTRA FOR YOU 
WE MANAGED TO FIND A FOUR BEDROOM DETACHED PROPERTY 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS A LOT BETTER A LOT MORE HOUSE GOOD DRIVEWAY 
TINA YEP DEFINITELY A LOT BETTER 
YOU'RE BOTH LOOKING A LOT HAPPIER I HAVE TO SAY WE WERE VERY WORRIED AFTER THE FIRST TWO PROPERTIES 
WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND WE THINK WE'VE DONE WELL ON THIS ONE 
YOU ASKED FOR TWO RECEPTION ROOMS IT'S GOT THREE RECEPTION ROOMS PLUS WE HAVE ALSO GIVEN YOU 
A COUPLE OF OTHER LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF 
IT'S VERY EXCITING IN THERE GO AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK 
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS DON'T YOU YEAH ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE AND COUNTING 
I DON'T WANT TO TEMPT FATE BUT THIS IS SOUNDING PRETTY POSITIVE I KNOW 
NICE BIG HALL THAT'S BETTER ISN'T IT 
THEY SEEM TO HAVE A FAR MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDE STRAIGHTAWAY 
DOWNSTAIRS SHOWER ROOM 
A BIG CORNER SHOWER THAT'S NICE 
SMALL ROOM BUT NICE 
THAT'S NICE WHEN YOU COME BACK FROM WORK STRAIGHT IN THE SHOWER IS THAT WHAT YOU DO 
GET TO THE HALLWAY AND RIP EVERYTHING OFF STRAIGHT IN THE SHOWER I DO ACTUALLY 
THE NEIGHBOURS HATE IT BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A COMPLETELY GLASS FRONTED HOUSE 
THERE'S THE FRONT DINING ROOM 
THAT'S A NICE BRIGHT ROOM 
NICE SIZE AS WELL FOR A DINING ROOM 
HOLD IT HOLD IT THEY'RE SAYING A ROOM IS A NICE SIZE 
AN EIGHT SEATER YOU COULD GET IN THERE QUITE COMFORTABLY COULDN'T YOU 
AND THE DECOR IS REASONABLE YEAH 
THE DOORS ARE NICE 
THE DOORS ARE NICE 
THEY'RE EXACTLY THE SAME DOORS 
DON'T DON'T I KNOW 
PROPERTY ONE YEP 
THIS IS THE LOUNGE 
THE MAIN LOUNGE ISN'T IT 
NICE FIREPLACE IT'S A NICE BIG FIREPLACE 
THAT'S A NICE SIZED ROOM AGAIN 
WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME SIZE AS THE SITTING ROOM IN PROPERTY TWO WHICH WAS TOO SMALL 
BIG ENOUGH FOR THE TELLY JUST 
OH YEAH 
IT'S A NICE ROOM WE'VE HAD AN AWFUL LOT OF NICES SO FAR A LOT OF NICES 
THIS IS NICE ISN'T IT 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
IT'S DEFINITELY GOT THE ROOMS THAT YOU WANT IT'S A NICE SIZE GARDEN AS WELL 
IT'S NOT TOO BIG IS IT 
GOSH THE DIFFERENCE 
IN ALL THE OTHERS IF ANYTHING WAS SLIGHTLY TOO SMALL IT WAS THAT'LL NEVER WORK 
HERE IT'S NOT A HUGE GARDEN BUT IT WORKS YOU COULD FIT A POOL IN HERE 
INTO THE KITCHEN 
IT'S A GOOD SIZED KITCHEN YES 
THAT'S A NICE KITCHEN ISN'T IT IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN 
I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS KITCHEN WHY 
I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT THINK IT WAS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE'S KITCHEN 
I HAVE TO SAY IT'S NICE BUT IT'S NOT RAGINGLY INDIVIDUAL NO 
NOT SURE ABOUT THE WORK SURFACES GREEN IT'S I'D CHANGE THOSE 
YEAH I'D HAVE TROUBLE WITH THAT GREEN COLOUR 
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM TO COOK WITH AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
THERE'S EVERYTHING HERE ISN'T THERE 
THEY WENT INTO THE KITCHEN THEY MENTIONED THAT IT WAS QUITE NICE 
THEY FAILED TO MENTION THAT IT'S GOT SUPER FRENCH WINDOWS RIGHT INTO THE GARDEN APPRECIATE THE ROOM A BIT 
IT SPLITS OFF EITHER SIDE 
WHICH WAY ARE WE GOING TO THE RIGHT TO THE RIGHT O. K. 
IT'S A TINY LITTLE ROOM SUPER 
IT'S THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY ROOM 
OUT THE WAY 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A BOY'S ROOM 
SMALL BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YEAH AND IT LOOKS OUT ONTO THE BACK GARDEN 
THAT'S NOT TOO BAD IS IT 
THIS IS ALL OF THE STUFF WE'VE SAID THEY COULD DO WITH PROPERTIES ONE AND TWO IT'S BEEN DONE 
THIS IS THE BATHROOM ISN'T IT 
IT'S A FAIR SIZE 
IT JUST NEEDS UPDATING 
AS WITH YOUR PROPERTY 
THEY NEED TO CHANGE THAT BATHROOM A LITTLE 
THIS IS THE MAIN ROOM 
THIS WOULD BE A DOUBLE ROOM AS WELL 
YOU COULD PUT A DOUBLE BED QUITE COMFORTABLY IN THERE 
IT'S ALL SOUNDING SO MUCH MORE POSITIVE 
ALL FITTED WARDROBES DRESSER YES THIS IS NICE 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE TO GET EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN A BEDROOM 
LOVELY DID YOU HEAR THAT YEAH 
OH LOOK A LITTLE CHILDREN'S ROOM 
LOOK AT THIS LITTLE BED I WAS QUITE DISTURBED BY THAT LITTLE BED 
WHY IT'S JUST REALLY LOW 
IT LOOKED LIKE A DOLLY'S BED AT FIRST IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
THIS IS NICE AGAIN ANOTHER SINGLE ROOM 
YOU COULD PUT A SINGLE BED THERE QUITE COMFORTABLY OR IF YOU DECIDED 
NOT TO USE IT AS A BEDROOM YOU COULD USE IT AS A DRESSING ROOM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SHE'S GETTING ALL LA DI D. A. 
SHE WANTS HER EXTRA BEDROOM FOR A DRESSING ROOM 
IT'S FINE AS IT IS NOW BUT IT WOULD BE 
JUST MODERNISING IT TO HOW YOU WANT IT YEAH 
I HAVE TO SAY AFTER THE FIRST TWO PROPERTIES THIS IS GONNA BE A BREEZE 
JACKIE THIS LITTLE ROOM THAT WE'VE GOT UP HERE AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS 
YOU'VE GOT STUD WALLS HERE BETWEEN THESE ROOMS 
I'D GET RID OF THOSE COMPLETELY AND PUT IN A DOORWAY BEHIND WHERE YOU'RE STANDING 
WHICH WOULD OPEN UP THIS WHOLE AREA OVER THE EXTENSION INTO ONE BIG ROOM 
I'D TURN THIS INTO YOUR MASTER BEDROOM WITH AN EN SUITE LITTLE DRESSING AREA 
RIGHT I COULD SEE THAT WORKING 
YOU'D HAVE A BIG DUAL ASPECT ROOM NICE AND LIGHT AND BRIGHT WHAT YOU THINK IT'S DIFFERENT 
WOULD YOU BE PREPARED TO TACKLE THAT BIT OF WORK 
I DON'T SEE THAT AS A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK TO DO REALLY 
IF IT'S PARTITIONS AND PUTTING DOORS UP THAT'S FINE 
YOU'RE NOT GOING INTO MAIN JOISTS OR MAIN WALLS 
NOTHING TRICKY AT ALL HAVE YOU THOUGHT HOW MUCH IT MIGHT BE YES WE HAVE 
O. K. TIME TO GUESS THE PRICE O. K. 
I LIKE THIS KITCHEN IN TERMS OF SIZE BUT I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S VERY EXCITING 
IT'S NOT VERY WELL CONFIGURED I QUITE LIKE IT 
I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE 
THE WAY THAT THEY'VE DONE IT IS REASONABLE 
I COULD LIVE WITH IT LIKE THIS 
I COULD BUT WE COULD MAYBE MAKE IT MORE EXCITING 
THERE ARE TWO AREAS I THINK WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING 
THIS TOP END IS JUST A BIT OF A NOTHING SPACE 
ONE OR TWO THINGS I'D DO WITH THAT EITHER EXTEND THE WORK SURFACE AROUND AND YOU CAN PUT 
MORE CUPBOARDS ON TOP THAT MEANS YOU'VE GOT A BIGGER WORK AREA WHICH WOULD LOOK BETTER 
GET RID OF THIS PRETEND BENCH HERE WHICH REALLY DOES NOTHING AT ALL 
IF IT WAS ME I'D GET RID OF THIS BENCH 
AND PUT A MASSIVE BIG AMERICAN STYLE FRIDGE IN THAT CORNER 
DEFINITELY SO YOU'VE GOT A BIT OF STYLE IN THERE AND AT THE MOMENT WE'VE GOT UNDER COUNTER FRIDGES 
LET'S FACE IT JACKIE AND TWO THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FRIDGE SPACE 
NOT AT ALL A GOOD BIG FRIDGE AND IT LOOKS FANTASTIC 
THE OTHER THING I'D DO IS HERE IF WE BUILD OUT A BREAKFAST BAR 
YOU'VE STILL GOT PLENTY OF ROOM TO GET THROUGH SIT EITHER SIDE OF IT 
GREAT FOR BREAKFAST TIME BUT ALSO WHEN YOU POP ROUND SIT EITHER SIDE OF IT HAVE A QUICK BREW 
THE NICE VIEW OF THE GARDEN MAKES IT MUCH NICER 
THE FINAL THING I'D DO LIGHTING IS RUBBISH 
UPDATE THE LIGHTING GET FAR MORE LIGHT IN HERE 
GET SOME DIMMERS ON IT SO YOU CAN CREATE SOME MOOD BUT ALSO IT'S BRIGHTER SO YOU CAN WORK 
DEFINITELY NOW ANY THOUGHTS ON PRICE THINKING 
IF THIS PROPERTY'S A HIT WITH JACKIE AND TINA THERE ARE SOME THINGS THEY NEED TO CONSIDER 
OUR WILD CARD IS SPACIOUS BOTH UPSTAIRS AND DOWN 
WITH JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF REDECORATION NEEDED 
IT'S ALREADY A GREAT FAMILY HOME AND COULD BE PERFECT FOR JACKIE 
THE HOUSE HAS ALREADY HAD A LOT OF WORK DONE TO IT 
AND THERE'S NO FURTHER SCOPE FOR EXTENDING 
WITH THIS PROPERTY WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET 
FOR THE LAST TIME TODAY IT'S TIME TO GUESS THE PRICE 
JACKIE YOU'RE TWO TO ZERO DOWN SO THIS IS FOR A BIT OF PRIDE 
OUR FOUR BEDROOM DETACHED PROPERTY IS ON THE MARKET FOR WHAT 
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED O. K. 
POSITIVE GUESS THERE TINA 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY 
OH JACKIE YOU'VE LOST THREE TIMES 
GAME OVER 
IT'S ACTUALLY ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S OVER YOUR BUDGET BUT AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S A BUYER'S MARKET SO THERE MIGHT BE SOME ROOM FOR NEGOTIATION THERE 
BUT THAT'S IT THREE PROPERTIES ARE DONE 
YOU'VE GOT TO DECIDE WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO TEST DRIVE 
TO HELP YOU ON THE LAPTOP WE'VE GOT PICTURES OF EVERY ROOM IN EVERY HOUSE YOU'VE SEEN 
HAVE A GOOD LOOK THROUGH AND MAKE THAT INFORMED DECISION WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO TEST DRIVE 
WE'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER O. K. OFF YOU GO 
WHILE THE GIRLS DO THAT HERE'S A REMINDER OF THE THREE PROPERTIES 
WILL PROPERTY ONE BE THE CHOICE FOR SNAKE LOVER JACKIE AND HER SISTER TINA 
IT'S QUITE A SPACIOUS HOME WITH OFF ROAD PARKING FOR TWO CARS AND A LARGE EXTENSION 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR A VERY REASONABLE 
HOW ABOUT PROPERTY TWO WHICH HAS THE BENEFIT OF A MATURE GARDEN 
IT'S GOT TWO GOOD SIZED RECEPTION ROOMS AND AN EXTENDED KITCHEN PLUS 
STILL PLENTY OF ROOM TO EXPAND ON THAT CORNER PLOT AND ALL FOR JUST 
OR MAYBE OUR WILD CARD PROPERTY THREE WILL SWING IT FOR JACKIE AND TINA 
FOUR BEDROOMED DETACHED HOMES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN FOR THE ASKING PRICE OF 
O. K. SO THIS IS THE FIRST HOUSE 
SMALL ENTRANCE HALL WASN'T IT YEP 
AND THEN THERE WERE SMALL RECEPTION ROOMS 
NICE KITCHEN THOUGH WASN'T IT 
IT WAS A NICE KITCHEN WITH A NICE BREAKFAST BAR 
NICE FITTED BATHROOM 
ALL TILED 
MODERN NEW O. K. 
MOVE ON TO THE SECOND ONE 
AGAIN VERY SIMILAR TO THE FIRST WASN'T IT 
TRADITIONAL SEMI DETACHED YES 
THE KITCHEN WAS A BIT DATED 
YEAH THAT HAD A NICER RECEPTION ROOM BUT AGAIN VERY SMALL 
IT HAD POTENTIAL DIDN'T IT THEN YOU HAD THE LEAN TO WHICH WAS LIKE A CONSERVATORY OR WHATEVER 
AGAIN IDEAL FOR A PROPER CONSERVATORY TO BE PUT ON IT 
HAD A LOT OF POTENTIAL IN THAT WAY 
ONTO THE THIRD ONE YES 
I LIKE THAT BETTER YES A LOT MORE HOUSE 
MORE ROOM IT LOOKS A LOT BETTER AT THE FRONT 
ROOMY INSIDE AND OUTSIDE 
AND THE FACT THAT IT'S DETACHED 
YES THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE 
WITH A NICE BIG DRIVEWAY 
THE KITCHEN'S REALLY NICE NICE SIZE IDEAL FOR ENTERTAINING 
BASICALLY HAVING NICE DINNER PARTIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
YEAH PLENTY OF WORK SURFACE PLENTY OF ROOM TOO 
YOU CAN USE THE KITCHEN AND THE CONSERVATORY COMING OFF 
THAT WAS GREAT THE GARDEN ITSELF WAS QUITE A BIG GARDEN 
THAT WAS A GOOD SIZE 
IT WAS THE WIDTH OF THE HOUSE 
AND THEN THE BEDROOMS IT WAS QUITE SURPRISING HOW NICE THE BEDROOMS WERE 
WITH ALL THE FITTED WARDROBES AND UNITS 
TWO DOUBLE BEDROOMS AND THEN TWO SINGLE BEDROOMS 
I KNOW WHICH ONE I'VE DECIDED ON 
YES WHAT ABOUT YOU 
I THINK THE DECISION'S MADE 
O. K. THAT'S GREAT THEN 
SO WHICH OF OUR NINETEEN THIRTIES DELIGHTS HAVE YOU CHOSEN TO TEST DRIVE 
IT IS PROPERTY NUMBER THREE THE WILD CARD 
WHY DID YOU GO FOR THIS ONE OVER THE OTHER TWO 
A LOT MORE HOUSE FOR THE MONEY REALLY 
AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE MORE CHARM THIS ONE KIND OF SPOKE TO YOU YES 
BEFORE YOUR TEST DRIVE WE'VE HAD THE TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY SURVEYOR 
GIVE THE PLACE THE ONCE OVER IT'S NOT A FULL SURVEY AND IT'S NOT LEGALLY BINDING 
IT'S TO GIVE YOU A FEW IDEAS OF WHAT MIGHT COME UP ON A PROPER SURVEY TWO THINGS HE'S FLAGGED UP 
IF YOU CAST YOUR EYES UPWARDS THEY'RE BOTH TO DO WITH THE ROOF AND THE CHIMNEY THE ROOF 
BAD NEWS IT NEEDS A NEW ROOF 
YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE TILES ARE BEGINNING TO LIFT A LITTLE BIT 
IN THE ROOF SPACE IT'S LINED WITH PLASTIC WHICH IS A SURE SIGN THERE ARE A FEW PROBLEMS 
IF YOU LOOK AROUND QUITE A FEW OF THE PROPERTIES AROUND HERE HAVE HAD NEW ROOFS ON 
SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY TO DO WITH THE AGE OF THE PROPERTY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S COSTLY WORTH DOING 
KEEPING YOUR EYES UP THERE FLICK TO THE LEFT LOOK AT THE TWO CHIMNEYS THEY'RE ACTUALLY LEANING 
ONE'S GOING ONE WAY ONE'S GOING THE OTHER WAY 
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS LOOKING AT BUT YOU CAN DO THAT AT THE SAME TIME AS THE ROOF 
NOT TOO MUCH OF A DISRUPTION 
APART FROM THAT A BIT OF TIDYING UP NEEDED ON THE INSIDE 
SOME THINGS NEED UPDATING BUT IT'S A GOOD SOLID PROPERTY 
TAKE YOURSELVES IN ENJOY YOUR TEST DRIVE AND WE'LL SEE YOU LATER OFF YOU GO 
MUCH LIKE THE CHIMNEY LET'S US GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS TOO AH 
IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT TASK FINDING A PROPERTY FOR JACKIE BUT IT'S THIRD TIME LUCKY 
JACKIE'S TAKING A MORE PRACTICAL APPROACH TO HER TEST DRIVE 
INVESTIGATING THE KITCHEN AND CHILLING OUT IN THE LOUNGE 
TINA ON THE OTHER HAND IS KEEN TO RELAX WITH A THOUGHT PROVOKING GAME OF CHESS 
ONE OF JACKIE'S ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS WAS SOMEWHERE FOR HER COLLAPSIBLE SWIMMING POOL 
IT'S TIME TO GIVE THE GARDEN THE ONCE OVER 
A NICE SIZE 
PUT THE KIDS' TRAMPOLINE UP HERE THE POOL OVER THERE 
BUT NOW SHE'S DISCOVERED WHAT OUR WILD CARD HAS TO OFFER WILL JACKIE BARTER OR SCARPER 
IT'S THE MOMENT OF TRUTH 
DID OUR FOUR BEDROOMED HOUSE FEEL NICE AND SPACIOUS FOR YOU 
IT WAS O. K. JUST O. K. IT DIDN'T FULFIL EVERYTHING THAT I WAS HOPING TO GET 
I THINK I WAS LOOKING MORE FOR 
MORE SPACE DOWNSTAIRS 
IN TERMS OF THE ROOM SIZE 
YES ROOM SIZE THE DINING ROOM'S A FINE SIZE BUT THE LOUNGE ISN'T BIG ENOUGH 
ALTHOUGH IT'S GOT THE CONSERVATORY ON IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM BIG ENOUGH FOR WHAT I WANT 
WHAT DID YOU THINK TINA I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY NICE HOUSE AND IT'S A NICE FAMILY HOUSE 
IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN FOR JACKIE BUT CERTAINLY O. K. FOR SOMEONE ELSE 
THE THING IS IT BRINGS US BACK TO WHERE WE WERE THIS MORNING WHEN WE'D BEEN TO THE ESTATE AGENTS 
TRYING TO FIND WHAT YOU WANTED FOR YOUR BUDGET 
YES IT WAS A REAL STRUGGLE AND TO BE HONEST WE LOOKED FAR AND WIDE 
AND THIS WAS ABOUT THE BIGGEST THAT WE COULD GET YOU RIGHT SO 
I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK AT HER BUDGET AGAIN 
I THINK SO I THINK SO YES I DO 
SOMETHING MAY HAVE TO GIVE 
I'LL KEEP LOOKING 
SO WE ARE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE AND COUNTING 
YES 
I GUESS THIS MEANS IN TERMS OF BARTER OR SCARPER 
SCARPER I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SCARPER UNFORTUNATELY 
GOOD LUCK KEEP IN TOUCH LET US KNOW HOW YOU GET ON 
AND WHEN YOU FINALLY CRACK IT WE WANT TO KNOW AT WHAT NUMBER YOU FINALLY FOUND THAT DREAM HOME 
EVEN THOUGH JACKIE DIDN'T BARTER SIMON 
I DON'T FEEL THAT WE'VE ENTIRELY FAILED COS I'M NOT SURE THERE IS A PROPERTY OUT THERE FOR HER 
SHE NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT WHERE SHE WANTS TO BE WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO 
BUT I DO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WHAT 
PROPERTY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR 
IF YOU'RE STILL LOOKING FOR YOUR PERFECT PROPERTY GET IN TOUCH 
LET TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY HELP YOU FIND YOUR DREAM HOME 
QUITE EXCITING 
THAT IS A L. O. T. OF PROPERTIES
