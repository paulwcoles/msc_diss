EVER WONDER WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A BUG 
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT 
THIS INCREDIBLE INVENTION IS THE TRANSLATION LENS 
IT TRANSLATES THE THOUGHTS OF SMALL CREATURES INTO LANGUAGE WE KNOW 
EXTRAORDINARY WE HAD NO IDEA HUMANS WERE SO INTELLIGENT 
WELCOME TO LIFE BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT 
BE ON YOUR BEST BEHAVIOUR IT'S TIME TO MEET THE PARENTS 
IT'S NOT EASY BEING A SINGLE PARENT 
I'VE GIVEN UP EXPECTING HELP FROM MALE PAPER WASPS 
THEY CAN'T EVEN SURVIVE THE WINTER 
US FEMALES HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING INCLUDING BUILDING THE NEST 
CREATING A NICE ENVIRONMENT FOR ONE'S CHILDREN 
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING A PARENT CAN DO 
THAT'S WHY I BUILD MY HOUSE OUT OF PLANT SCRAPINGS AND 
SPIT 
OOH THE FIRST EGG'S ON THE WAY QUICK BOTTOM IN CELL AND 
I'D DEARLY LIKE SOME TIME OFF 
BUT I'LL BE LAYING FIFTY MORE EGGS IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS 
SO I HAVE TO GET ON WITH BUILDING THIS NEST 
HOPEFULLY THE FIRST ONE WILL SOON BE ABLE TO HELP WITH BABY SITTING 
IT'S HARD LOOKING AFTER A FAMILY THIS BIG 
HUBBUB 
HUH CALL THAT A HUGE FAMILY 
I THINK YOU'LL FIND FIFTY THOUSAND IS HUGE 
BUILDING A NEST BIG ENOUGH IS A DEVILISHLY TRICKY TASK 
BUT AS THEY SAY WHEN YOU'RE AN ANT IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK 
WE SPEND ALL SPRING FETCHING TWIGS AND BRANCHES 
TO BUILD AN ENORMOUS FORTRESS TO PROTECT OUR LITTLE ONES 
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT KIND OF ANT YOU ARE 
PARENTING DOESN'T STOP ONCE THE NEST IS BUILT 
THESE GARDEN ANTS ARE TAKING CARE OF THEIR BABIES BY MOVING THEM 
THE NEST CAN GET VERY COLD 
SO SOMETIMES THE KIDDIES THE EGG THE LARVAE AND THE PUPAE 
NEED TO BE MOVED TO A WARM PART 
SOMETIMES IT CAN GET VERY HOT SO THEY ARE MOVED TO THE COOL PART 
WE WANT A HEALTHY HATCHED EGG NOT A BOILED ONE 
OH MAKE WAY 
OUT OF ME WAY EXCUSE ME WOULD YOU MIND 
THANK YOU VERY KINDLY WHAT A LOVELY SHINY LARVA 
IT'S NOT JUST OUR OWN KIND WE TAKE CARE OF 
WE LOOK AFTER OTHER INSECTS TOO 
APHIDS IT'S AN ANT'S JOB TO LOOK AFTER THEM AND THEIR BABIES 
AS IF THEY WERE OUR OWN 
IT'S A GOOD JOB WE DO COS BETWEEN YOU ME AND THE OTHER FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE ANTS 
APHIDS REALLY ARE THE WORLD'S WORST PARENTS 
THEY POP OUT BABIES AT ALARMING SPEED AND LEAVE THEM TO IT 
MAMA 
SORRY MUST DASH HAVE A NICE LIFE OH 
THESE BABIES DON'T EVEN HAVE A FATHER 
THEY'RE CLONES OF THEIR MOTHERS THEY DON'T DO MUCH MOTHERING 
IT'S LUCKY WE FIGHT OFF ATTACKS FROM LADYBIRDS 
GET OFF YOU BIG THIEVING EEJIT 
I'M NOT A THIEF I SLIPPED OVER AND ACCIDENTALLY BIT HIS BUM OFF 
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY 
YOU MAY THINK WE'VE GOT ENOUGH TO DO WITHOUT LOOKING AFTER OTHER KIDS 
BUT YOU HAVEN'T TASTED HONEYDEW FROM AN APHID 
OH THAT'S SO LOVELY OH 
THOSE APHIDS ARE AN ODD LOT 
OUT THEY POP AND GET ON WITH IT 
MOST INSECT BABIES GO THROUGH MANY STAGES 
EGG LARVAE AND MY EGGS HAVE HATCHED INTO LITTLE GRUBS 
SO I SHOULD BE FEEDING THEM INSTEAD OF RABBITING 
I'VE BEEN FOOD SHOPPING I MEAN KILLING 
I KILLED THIS MANTIS FOR DINNER 
HAVE YOU TRIED MANTIS YOU MUST 
IT'D MAKE A CHANGE FROM FISH FINGERS MANTIS AND CHIPS 
OH MAMA MAMA WHAT'S FOR TEA WHAT'S FOR TEA 
ONE AT A TIME ONE AT A TIME WHO WANTS A BIT OF CHEWED UP MANTIS 
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU SPIT ALL OVER IT OH I LOVE IT 
IT'S JUST LIKE KETCHUP ON CHIPS 
WE LOVE A BIT OF SPIT ON OUR MANTIS 
WHAT'S FOR PUDDING A SPECIAL TREAT CHEWED UP MANTIS 
HOORAY HOORAY 
WITH A HIGH PROTEIN DIET THE KIDS GROW INTO A PUPA IN TWO WEEKS 
MY FIRST BORN HAS ALREADY STARTED PUPATING 
OH MAMA I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU WHEN I'M A PROPER GROWN UP 
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU SO MUCH 
IT'S COMPLICATED BRINGING UP SPROGS AND MOST INSECTS MAKE A HASH OF IT 
IF YOU DON'T LOOK AFTER THEM 
THEY'LL TURN OUT NO BETTER THAN HUMAN CHILDREN NO OFFENCE 
OH SHE'S TALKING ABOUT US BLUEBOTTLES 
YOU MENTION LEAVING YOUR EGGS ON SOME MEAT AND CLEARING OFF ONCE 
AND THEY GO ON AND ON ABOUT IT 
THEY ABANDON THEIR EGGS LEAVE THEM ALL ALONE 
I NEED A LIE DOWN 
ALL RIGHT CHANGE THE RECORD LOVE 
WHAT'S THE POINT OF BUILDING A HOUSE 
AND RUNNING TO AND FRO WITH FOOD ALL DAY 
LIKE A BLUE BOTTOMED FLY WHICH I AM 
WHEN YOU CAN HAVE YOUR HOME AND FOOD IN ONE PLACE 
DON'T GET UPSET STUFF HAPPENS 
AND THIS POOR BADGER IS GIVING MY KIDS SOMEWHERE PERFECT TO LIVE 
HAPPY DAYS AIN'T NATURE BEAUTIFUL 
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK I LAY MY EGGS IN ROTTEN MEAT 
WELL IT AIN'T TRUE I LIKE FRESH 
SEE I'M NOT ONLY GIVING THEM A WARM SAFE HOME 
I'M GIVING THEM MORE FOOD THAN THEY COULD WISH FOR 
THING IS PLACES LIKE THIS ARE QUITE POPULAR AMONG FLIES 
THERE THAT'S GOTTA BE AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED HOW MANY HAVE YOU LAID THEN 
ONE HUNDRED TWO 
O. O. O. AGH 
I TELL A LIE ONE HUNDRED THREE SHOW OFF 
TYPICAL BLUE BOTTOM GET IT BLUEBOTTLE BLUE BOTTOM 
HA A A A VERY FUNNY WHAT YOU DOING HERE ANYWAY 
I THOUGHT GREENBOTTLES LIKED LAYING EGGS ON DOG POO WE'RE ADAPTABLE 
WE'RE AS MUCH AT HOME ON A DEAD BADGER AS A PILE OF POO 
HELLO HELLO I'M ALL RIGHT 
THERE'S SOME BANTER BUT ONCE THE EGGS ARE LAID 
WE'RE DONE WE'RE OUTTA THERE 
SAY I'M A BAD PARENT IF YOU LIKE 
BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT WHERE YOU LEAVE YOUR KIDS 
AND A FRESH BIT OF ROADKILL IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS 
THE BADGER MAY DISAGREE 
SHE'S RIGHT IT IS ALL ABOUT WHERE YOU LAY YOUR EGGS 
BUT I GET HELP WELL HE CALLS IT HELP 
DO NOT WORRY MY LOVE I'LL PROTECT YOU IN DAMSELFLY FASHION 
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN I'VE GOT THE PERFECT STICK FOR ME EGGS 
E. Y. YOU GET OFF LIKE OW 
GET OFF WE'D REALLY LIKE THIS ONE 
THIS IS OURS COME ON 
WHO SAID THIS WAS YOURS HEY STOP IT IT'S NOT WORTH IT 
IT IS THAT'S A GOOD STICK THE EGG LAYING SITE HAS TO BE PERFECT 
JUST THE RIGHT SORT OF PLANT 
BREAKING THROUGH THE SURFACE OF THE LAKE AT THE RIGHT TIME 
I'VE REPELLED THE INVADERS HONESTLY THEY ARE WET BLANKETS 
EXCEPT THE ONLY ONES WHO ACTUALLY GET WET ARE US GIRLS 
ONCE WE'VE FOUND THE PERFECT PLACE I LAY A BATCH OF EGGS 
WHILE I'M DOING THIS TRICKY MANOEUVRE WHAT'S HE DOING 
DO NOT WORRY MY DEAR I SHALL STAND GUARD HIGH ABOVE YOU 
NICE AND DRY ARE YOU I THOUGHT AS MUCH UNBELIEVABLE 
SPLASH 
SO HERE I AM UNDERWATER 
WHERE I'M NOT DESIGNED TO BE 
LAYING EGGS IN A PROTECTIVE PLANT 
AND MY FELLA CHOOSES NOW TO LET GO TYPICAL 
OH MY DARLING WELL DONE 
THE PERFECT PLACE FOR OUR BABIES TO HATCH I'M SO PROUD OF YOU 
THANKS YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT HELP 
OH IT'S THIS WAY NO IT'S THAT WAY 
OVER HERE I KNOW THE BEST PLACES 
WE'D BE SORTED BY NOW IF YOU'D LISTENED BACK SEAT DRIVER 
LOWER ME WHERE I ASK SO I CAN LAY EGGS IN THE WATER 
IS THAT REALLY TOO COMPLICATED FOR YOUR DRAGONFLY BRAIN 
NO I JUST THINK YOU'RE BETTER OFF LAYING THEM ALL OVER THERE 
IF WE LAY THEM TOO CLOSE TOGETHER WHEN THEY HATCH 
THE LARVAE WILL EAT EACH OTHER 
THEY'VE GOT A VICIOUS STREAK 
YEAH A VICIOUS STREAK WHO DO THEY TAKE AFTER DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK 
AND STOP PUSHING ME IN THE WRONG DIRECTION 
UGH THOSE DIRTY DRAGONFLIES ALWAYS ON AT EACH OTHER 
THEY SHOULD DUMP THE BLOKES AND DO IT ON YOUR OWN 
TAKE IT FROM THE EMPEROR DRAGONFLY NO BLOKES NO DISTRACTIONS 
I FOUND THE PERFECT SITE SO I'M DONE LAY THE EGGS 
LEAVE THEM TO IT SORTED 
WINGS HUM 
WHY HAVE CHILDREN IF YOU DON'T SEE HOW THEY TURN OUT DARLING 
JUST LOOK HOW WELL ALL MY DAUGHTERS HAVE DONE 
THEY'RE LOVELY LOOKING SPLENDID GIRLS THEY HELP OUT 
COLLECTING FOOD BRINGING UP THE NEXT LOT 
MAKING THE NEST EVEN BETTER 
I DON'T LIKE TO GO ON BUT I AM A MODEL PARENT 
BRINGS A TEAR TO ONE'S EYE 
YOU KNOW I THINK SHE'S RIGHT 
I COULDN'T IMAGINE NOT STICKING AROUND FOR MY KIDS 
AS LONG AS I'M THERE 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE US EARWIGS LAY OUR EGGS 
THEY'RE HAPPY UNDER THIS DAMP LOG 
I PUT EVERYTHING INTO LOOKING AFTER MY EGGS 
THEY NEED CLEANING AND CARING FOR NOW 
ALMOST AS MUCH AS WHEN THEY'RE BORN THEY SHOULD BE HATCHING ANY SECOND 
AREN'T THEY LITTLE DARLINGS 
BEAUTIFUL MIND YOU 
THIS IS WHEN THE FUN STARTS 
THEY GET INTO ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE THAT'S WHY I STAY WITH THEM 
FEEDING AND PROTECTING THEM IF I DIDN'T 
THEY'D END UP LIKE BABY LADYBIRDS 
I TAKE IT YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM 
I DON'T GOSSIP 
BUT I'VE HEARD AS SOON AS THEY'VE LAID THEIR EGGS 
THEY EAT A COUPLE OF THEM WHAT SORT OF PARENTING IS THAT 
THEN THEY'RE OFF KILLING APHIDS AND FIGHTING ANTS 
LEAVING THE EGGS ON THEIR OWN NO WONDER THOSE KIDS TURN OUT BAD 
AS SOON AS THEY HATCH 
THE LADYBIRD LARVAE ATTACK AND EAT EACH OTHER 
TRUST ME YOU DON'T WANNA HATCH NEXT TO A LADYBIRD 
THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN WITH MY LOT 
NATHAN LEAVE YOUR BROTHER ALONE 
I'M JUST HAVING A LICK STOP IT 
YOU TURN YOUR BACK FOR ONE MINUTE NATHAN WHAT DID I TELL YOU NATHAN 
WELL US SAND WASPS HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH OUR KIDS EATING ONE ANOTHER 
BECAUSE I GIVE THEM EACH THEIR OWN HOLE TO GROW UP IN 
I ALSO FIND A LITTLE FRIEND TO KEEP THEM COMPANY 
I'VE GOT A CATERPILLAR HERE JUST PARALYSED 
HE'S STILL ALIVE HE'LL PROVIDE THE SPROG 
WITH ALL THE FOOD IT'LL NEED BLESS HIM 
I'M GOING TO BURY HIM IN A HOLE AND LEAVE AN EGG ON IT 
JUST BITING THE BACK OF HIS HEAD SO HE DOES HIS POO 
OUTSIDE THE HOLE 
DON'T WANT MY CHILD SEEING CATERPILLAR POO IN HE GOES 
GOOD LAD SEAL UP THE HOLE SMASHING JOB 
LA LA LA 
IMAGINE WAKING UP WITH ENOUGH FOOD TO EAT TILL YOU'RE SIXTEEN 
AND NO PARENT TO HASSLE YOU NOW THAT IS IMPRESSIVE 
IT SEEMS THE SAND WASP HAS THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING 
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG 
WELL FRANKLY I COME ALONG DARLING HMM 
THE AROMA OF BURIED CATERPILLAR JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR 
DIDN'T CAMOUFLAGE THIS VERY WELL 
I CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO DIG MY OWN HOLE AND FIND MY OWN CATERPILLAR 
I CAN HOWEVER BE BOTHERED TO GET RID OF THE ORIGINAL EGG 
BIT OF A STICKY ONE THIS 
AND THEN POP IT BACK IN THE HOLE 
AND LAY MY OWN EGG ON IT 
I'VE EVEN GOT THE CHEEK TO COVER IT USING THE SAME STONE 
MUM'S THE WORD 
BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE DISTURBS IT 
MORE STONES MORE EARTH WELL 
YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYONE CAN YOU 
IF EVER I NEEDED A REASON TO STAY WITH MY CHILDREN THAT'S IT 
I ALMOST THOUGHT THERE WAS A BETTER PARENT THAN ME 
NOW I KNOW WHY I BUILT THIS NICE SAFE HOME FOR MY GALS I FED THEM 
AS THEY GREW AND WE LIVE HAPPILY TOGETHER 
WE DON'T EAT EACH OTHER AND WE ALL HELP OUT WITH JOBS ABOUT THE PLACE 
SOUND FAMILIAR 
I WANT THE TOP BUNK MUM WHAT'S FOR TEA 
MY MOTHER WAS BORN IN A DEAD BADGER 
MY GRANDMOTHER WAS BORN IN A DEAD BADGER 
I WAS BORN IN A DEAD BADGER WE'RE DEAD BADGER PEOPLE
