HELLO MY NAME IS GEORGIA AND I LIKE PLAYING THE STEEL PANS 
I ENJOY IT VERY MUCH 
THEY ARE AN INSTRUMENT 
AND THEY WERE ORIGINALLY MADE OF METAL OIL DRUMS 
EVERY FRIDAY I PRACTISE FROM SIX HUNDRED THIRTY TO NINE 
I'VE BEEN LEARNING SINCE I WAS THREE 
I'M STILL LEARNING SOME NEW SONGS NOW 
BUT I KNOW WHERE ALL THE NOTES ARE ON THE PANS 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AROUND THE STEEL PANS 
BECAUSE MY FAMILY PLAY AND TEACH AND MAKE THEM 
MY GRANDAD MAKES THE PANS IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE BAND ROOM 
EVERY DAY HE'S HERE WORKING ON THE PANS AND HE'S MADE HUNDREDS OF THEM 
HE MAKES ABOUT ONE PAN A DAY 
I TRY AND HELP BUT I'M NOT REALLY VERY GOOD 
WHEN I GO TO TRINIDAD THERE IS A BIG COMPETITION 
WHERE LOADS OF BANDS WITH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE PLAYING 
ALL PLAY AGAINST EACH OTHER 
THOSE ARE THE BASS WHICH PLAYS THE LOWEST OF ALL THE PANS 
THOSE ARE THE SOPRANOS WHICH I PLAY 
THEY PLAY THE MELODY OF THE TUNE 
AND ARE THE HIGHEST OF ALL THE PANS 
MY FAVOURITE SONG IS HEY THERE DELILAH 
I'VE PLAYED IN LOADS OF GIGS ALL AROUND ENGLAND 
WE GO FAR PLACES AND SOME PLACES ARE IN COVENTRY 
I HAVE PLAYED IN BARCELONA AND STOKE ON TRENT 
AND I'VE PLAYED IN LOADS OF CARNIVALS 
THE STEEL PANS ARE REALLY LOUD 
I HAVE A STEEL PAN AT HOME AND I PRACTISE ALL THE TIME ON IT 
MY NAME'S GEORGIA AND I LIKE PLAYING THE STEEL PANS
