GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO 
THURSDAY'S WORKING LUNCH A LEGAL 
CHALLENGE FROM NORTHERN ROCK 
SHAREHOLDERS THEY WANT THE COURTS 
TO DECIDE WHAT COMPENSATION THEY 
SHOULD GET ALSO TODAY WHY 
INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN KEPT ON 
HOLD THIS MONTH THE BILLION POUND 
DEAL TO CHALLENGE THE HIGH STREET 
ELECTRICAL SHOPS AND THE CHANCE TO 
PUT A ROCKET UP YOUR CAREER AS THE 
SEARCH STARTS FOR NEW ASTRONAUTS 
FIRST NORTHERN ROCK SHAREHOLDERS 
ARE APPLYING FOR A JUDICIAL REVIEW 
OF THE TERMS OF THE BANK'S 
NATIONALISATION THEY ARE AFRAID 
THEY WILL GET A RAW DEAL OVER THE 
AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION WHICH WILL 
EVENTUALLY BE PAID SIMON HAS BEEN 
LOOKING AT THIS HE IS AT AN 
ADVANTAGE TAKE POINT OVERLOOKING 
THE CITY WHAT IS A JUDICIAL 
REVIEW REVIEW A JUDICIAL REVIEW IS WHEN YOU ASK A 
JUDGE TO LOOK AT THE LAWFULNESS OF 
A DECISION THAT HAS BEEN MADE BY A 
PUBLIC BODY IT IS PART OF THE 
JUMBLE OF OUR CONSTITUTION BUT IT 
IS NOT DECIDING WHETHER WHAT THEY 
CAME UP WITH WAS RIGHT OR WRONG IT 
IS ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH THE 
DECISION WAS MADE NOW YOU JOIN ME 
ON THE BALCONY OF CITY HALL IN 
LONDON WE HAVE A WONDERFUL VIEW OF 
THE CITY HERE IF YOU LOOK BACK 
OVER WHAT HAPPENED TO NORTHERN ROCK 
YOU RECAP ON THE SITUATION IT WAS 
ON FEBRUARY SEVENTEENTH THAT IT WAS 
NATIONALISED AS PART OF THE 
NATIONALISATION THEY LAID DOWN 
THERE WOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT 
VALUER APPOINTED TO DECIDE HOW MUCH 
COMPENSATION SHAREHOLDERS WERE 
GOING TO GET OUT OF IT BUT THE 
RULES LAID DOWN FOR THE VALUE HAS 
NOT YET BEEN APPOINTED IS THAT 
THEY SHOULD CONSIDER THAT NORTHERN 
ROCK WAS NOT A GOING CONCERN AND 
ALSO THAT IT WAS IN ADMINISTRATION 
SO IT WOULD NOT BASICALLY HAVE THE 
PROFIT THE THE PROPER TAXPAYER 
SUPPORT AND IT MIGHT MAKE THE 
VALUE LESS WHICH IS A STICKING 
POINT FOR SHAREHOLDERS L. AM JOINED 
HERE BY ROGER LAWSON WHO IS THE 
HEAD OF THE U. K. SHAREHOLDERS' 
ASSOCIATION ROGER YOU ARE 
PRESSING FOR THIS JUDICIAL REVIEW 
FIRST OF ALL HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK 
THAT YOU WOULD GET OUT OF THIS 
ASSESSMENT AND HOW MUCH DO YOU 
THINK SHAREHOLDERS DESERVE 
IF IT 
WAS A FAIR AND INDEPENDENT 
VALUATION USING NORMAL COMMERCIAL 
PRINCIPALS WE THINK THE RANGE 
WOULD BE THREE UP WARDS CLEARLY THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO ARGUE 
IT WOULD BE WORTH NOTHING WE WOULD 
ARGUE IT IS WORTH MORE THAN THREE YOU YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE SEVERAL POUNDS 
PER SHARE WHAT IS YOUR ARGUMENT 
CLEARLY THE COMPANY WAS NOT IN 
ADMINISTRATION IT WAS GOING 
CONCERN AT THE TIME OF 
NATIONALISATION SO IT HAD VALUE 
THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY PER 
SHARE WERE OVER THREE 
BUT THE 
TREASURY'S ARGUMENT IS THAT THE 
TAXPAYER IS PROPPING UP NORTHERN 
ROCK IT WOULD BE ABSURD THEY SAY 
FOR THE TAXPAYER IN THOSE 
CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE PROVIDING A 
LARGE MEASURE OF COMPENSATION TO 
SHAREHOLDERS THE TAXPAYER GETS 
MUGGED TWICE THERE 
I WOULD ARGUE 
IT IS NOT PROPPING IT UP IT WOULD 
LEND ON COMMERCIAL TERMS UNDER THE 
LENDER OF LAST RESORT FACILITIES AT 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS BEEN 
OFFERING TO OTHER PEOPLE AND OTHER 
BANKS THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO 
DO THAT IN ESSENCE IF THE 
GOVERNMENT THINKS THEY CAN ARGUE 
THAT IT IS WORTH NOTHING THEY 
SHOULD ALLOW AN INDEPENDENT FAIR 
VALUER TO DETERMINE THE CASE 
SOMEONE WHO IS NOT SHAREHOLDER 
WOULD SAY WELL NORTHERN ROCK WOULD 
HAVE GONE BUST IF IT HAD NOT BEEN 
PROPPED UP BY THE GOVERNMENT 
THEREFORE THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN 
VALUE FOR SHAREHOLDERS 
YES BUT 
THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED NOT TO LET 
IT GO BUST AND NOW THEY ARE TRYING 
TO BACK TRACK ON THAT DECISION AND 
EFFECTIVELY THE SHAREHOLDERS ARE 
LOSING OUT AS A RESULT THE 
GOVERNMENT CHOSE TO KEEP IT IN 
BUSINESS 
YOU ARE BASING THIS ON BUSINESS HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION WHAT IS 
THE HUMAN RIGHT INVOLVED HERE WELL WELL THE HUMAN RIGHT IS EVEN BEFORE THE 
EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
WAS ESTABLISHED THERE WAS 
PRECEDENTS IN THE U. K. THAT IF A 
COMPANY IS NATIONALISED IF 
GOVERNMENT TAKES YOUR ASSETS AWAY 
THE SHARES TAKEN AWAY THEN YOU 
SHOULD RECEIVE FAIR COMPENSATION 
THERE IS AN ARTICLE IN THE EUROPEAN 
CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH 
REINFORCES THAT AND A LOT OF CASE 
LAW ON THE SUBJECT 
IS THERE MUCH 
TO GIVE YOU ENCOURAGEMENT HERE IT 
IS DEBATABLE RAILTRACK 
SHAREHOLDERS WHO PERSUED THEIR 
FIGHT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT THEY 
DID GET SOMETHING IN THE END BUT 
THEY DID NOT WIN THEIR CASE IN 
COURT 
IT WAS NOT A NATIONALISATION COURT IT WAS FORCED INTO ADMINISTRATION 
BY THE GOVERNMENT SECONDLY THE 
SHAREHOLDERS WERE TRYING TO PROVE 
IN PUBLIC OFFICE THAT IS NOT PART 
OF THIS CASE WE ARE SAYING IT IS 
STRAIGHTFORWARD NATIONALISATION 
AND THE ACTS OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE 
UNREASONABLE 
HOW MUCH IS THIS UNREASONABLE COSTING SHAREHOLDERS IN NORTHERN 
ROCK 
IN TERMS OF LEGAL FEES YES ROCK YES IT WOULD BE EXPENSIVE L. HAVE NOT 
SEEN THE BILLS YET THERE ARE OF 
COURSELY OBVIOUSLY SEVERAL GROUPS 
OF LAWYERS INVOLVED IT IS A COUPLE 
OF INSTITUTIONS THEY WILL BE 
EMPLOYING THEIR OWN LAWYERS AS WELL 
IT WILL BE EXPENSIVE THAT WHY WE 
ARE RAISING DONATIONS AND ENCOURAGE 
PEOPLE TO CONTACT US AND MAKE A 
CONTRIBUTION 
THANK YOU CONTRIBUTION AND FROM THE BALCONY OF CITY HALL 
OVERLOOKING THE CITY OF LONDON IT 
IS BACK TO YOU 
THANK YOU 
AND IN 
THE LAST HOUR IN THAT CITY THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND HAS DECIDED TO KEEP 
INTEREST RATES AT FIVE PER CENT SO LET'S 
IMMEDIATELY GO TO JANET HENRY SHE 
IS AN ECONOMISTS WITH H. S. B. C. THINK 
YOU ARE PREPARING TO BRIEF YOUR OWN 
TRADERS YOU HAVE KINDLY AGREED TO 
BRIEF THE WORKING LUNCH VIEWERS 
BEFORE THEN L. IMAGINE THEY HAVE 
LOTS ON THEIR MIND ABOUT INFLATION 
AND HOUSE PRICES 
I THINK THE 
DECISION TODAY WAS NOT TOO MUCH OF 
A SURPRISE L. THINK IT IS 
INTERESTING A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO 
THE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND MADE A SPEECH DESCRIBING 
THE CURRENT POSITION OF THE 
MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE AS 
SOMETHING LIKE WALKING A TIGHT ROPE 
THEY HAVE THE IMPACT OF THE CREDIT 
SQUEEZE AND HOUSE PRICES ON THE 
OTHER SIDE THEY HAVE BIG CONCERNS 
ABOUT INFLATION FROM RISING 
COMMODITY PRICES WE WILL SEE 
FURTHER CUTS IN RATES JUST NOT YET 
IT NEEDS TO BE GRADUAL AT THIS 
POINT 
STAYING ON IN INFLATION POINT THAT IS HITTING PEOPLE IN THEIR 
POCKETS THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS OF 
THOUGHT ONE SAYING BY KEEPING THAT 
HAND STEADY YOU RISK INFLATION 
GOING UP OH THIS THERS SAY 
ECONOMISTS WILL ALWAYS DISAGREE ON 
THINGS LIKE THAT WHAT IS YOUR 
VIEW 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND AT THIS VIEW STAGE IS WORRIED IF THEY CUT 
INTEREST RATES TOO AGGRESSIVELY IT 
IS SAYING THE ONLY THING THAT 
COUNTS IS GROWTH INFLATION NO 
LONGER MATTERS IF THEY LOSE 
CONTROL OF INFLATION IF PEOPLE 
START TO SEE THAT THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT 
INFLATION THEN THEY WILL START TO 
BE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THEIR WAGE 
NEGLOSHATIONS THE RISK IS IF THEY 
CUT RATES TOO QUICKLY IT WILL FEED 
THROUGH INTO HIGHER INFLATION 
EXPECTATIONS AND HIGHER WAGE DEALS 
GOING FORWARD MY FEAR IS TOO 
AGGRESSIVE RATE CUTS WOULD FUEL 
INFLATION RATHER THAN KEEPING IT 
UNDER CONTROL 
WITH THAT IN MIND 
MANY VIEWERS ARE HIT ON FOOD PRICES 
OIL PRICES ET CETERA BUT ALSO ON 
THEIR ENERGY PRICES TO THE HOME 
THERE IS TALK TODAY I HAVE SEEN OF 
MORE HUGE ENERGY RISES DO YOU 
THINK THAT WILL BE FUELLED BY 
TODAY'S DECISION 
NO L. DON'T THINK 
ENERGY ITSELF WILL BE FUELLED BY 
TODAY'S DECISION YOU ARE RIGHT 
FOOD AND ENERGY ARE THE TWO THINGS 
DRIVING IN FLAIGS IN THE U. K. GIVEN 
WE HAVE SEEN WHOLESALE GAS PRICES 
MOVE UP THERE IS A RISK UTILITY 
PRICES RISE PROBABLY AROUND OCTOBER 
TIME THAT WILL PUSH UP INFLATION 
THE U. K. IS A FLEXIBLE ECONOMY WHAT 
SEEMS TO HAVE HAPPENED SO FAR IS 
ALTHOUGH CONSUMERS SPEND MORE ON 
FOOD AND ENERGY THEY HAVE NO 
CHOICE IN THAT IT SQUEEZES 
SPENDING ON OTHER GOODS AND 
SERVICES PARTICULARLY HOUSEHOLD 
GOODS THAT TENDS TO FORCE DOWN THE 
PRICE OF OTHER GOODS AND SERVICES 
IT PROBABLY MEANS A DIFFICULT TIME 
FOR HIGH STREET RETAILERS 
YOU HAVE 
GOT EUROPEAN IN YOUR TITLE I 
GUESS I OUGHT TO LET YOU COMMENT ON 
THE STRENGTH OF THE POUND BOTH 
FROM A TRAVELLING ABROAD BASIS AND 
FOREIGN TRADE THE EXPECTATION IS 
THAT STERLING WILL WEAKEN FURTHER 
I THINK MORE SO AGAINST THE DOLLAR 
THIS TIME WE HAVE SEEN 
SUBSTANTIAL MOVE OF THE POUND 
AGAINST THE EURO NOW IN THE LAST 
COUPLE OF WEEK WE HAVE SEEN THE 
EURO START TO WEAKEN TO SOME DEGREE 
AGAINST THE DOLLAR WE KNOW ABOUT 
THE WEAK OUTLOOK IN THE U. S. ECONOMY 
THE POUND WILL WEAKEN BUT MORE 
AGAINST THE DOLLAR THAN AGAINST THE 
EURO 
THE ODDS WERE EVEN ON NO EURO CHANGE TODAY YOU WOULD NOT HAVE 
GOT MUCH IN A BETTING SHOP DO YOU 
THINK THE GODS WILL BE STACKED FOR 
AN INTEREST RATE RATE CUT 
I THINK 
MOST PEOPLE WOULD BET R. N. IT BEING A 
NEAR CERTAINTY THAT WE GET A RATE 
CUT IN JUNE 
WE WILL HOLD YOU TO 
THAT THAT ADAM HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING 
NO I HAVE NOT BEEN DRINKING IT IS A REAL ESTATE 
STATUS IT IS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST THIS IS A BIG 
ISSUE FOR THE PUB SECTOR ALTHOUGH 
THEY SERVE BEER THERE ARE MASSIVE 
PROPERTY COMPANIES THAT IS WHAT 
INVESTORS HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN 
THIS RULING COULD DRASTICALLY 
CHANGE THE WAY PUB FIRMS ARE 
STRUCTURED THE MOVE MEANS FOR 
INSTANCE THAT GREEN KING AND PUNCH 
COMPETING PUBS ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW 
SUIT HAVING WATCHED ENTERPRISE IT 
MEANS THOSE TRIO I THINK ARE LIKELY 
AT LEAST TO LOCK AT SPLITING THEIR 
BUSINESS BETWEEN A MANAGED PUBS 
BUSINESS AND OPERATING DIVISION AND 
PUBS WHICH OTHER PEOPLE RUN AND PAY 
THEM RENT ENTERPRISE INNS DID 
ASTOUNDINGLY WELL THIS MORNING 
WHEN I LOGGED ON TO OUR COMPUTER 
THE SHARES HAD GONE NUTS THEY WERE 
UP THIRTY PER CENT IN THE FIRST HOUR OF TRADING 
QUICKLY INTERESTING PATTERNS 
DEVELOPED ONE OF THE MAJOR BROKERS 
HAD A DOWNGRADING AS A RESULT I 
THINK OF THAT THE SHARES TURNED 
ROUND GOING FROM WHAT WAS 
DEFINITELY THE BEST PERFORMER OF 
THE MORNING THEY BECAME THE WORST 
PERFORMER OF THE MORNING 
ENTERPRISE INNS ARE THIRTY P. LOWER AT 
FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY PUNCH 
TAVEVERNS UP THREE PER CENT 
A VERY DIVERGENT SECTOR THERE IN 
TERMS OF SHARE PERFORMANCE IN 
SPITE OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE A GOOD 
RULING ON BEHALF OF THE PUB GROUP 
THEMSELVES EARLIER I ASKED OUR TAX 
EXPERT FROM PRICE WATERHOUSE 
COOPERS WHY THAT STATUS IS SO 
BENEFICIAL TO COMPANIES 
A REAL 
ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST IS A UNIT 
TRUST FOR PROPERTIES RATHER THAN 
HAVING A COMPANY WHICH RENTS OUT A 
LOT OF PROPERTIES IS TAXED ON THE 
INCOME IT GETS T. GAINS IT MAKES 
THEN THE SHAREHOLDERS ARE TAXED 
WHEN THEY GET DIVIDENDS OR SELL THE 
SHARES IT IS A TAX TRANSPARENT IT 
RECEIVES THE RENTS DOESN'T PAY TAX 
WHEN IT PASSES DIVIDENDS OUT TO 
SHAREHOLDERS WHICH IT HAS GOT TO DO 
O. K. THEY PAY TAX BUT OF COURSE IT 
IS TAKEN ONE LAYER OF TAX OUT IT 
IS QUITE TAX EFFICIENT THERE IS A 
TAX COST IN CONVERTING BUT IT IS 
SEEN AS A TAX EFFICIENT VEHICLE 
YOU CAN SEE ALLIANCE AND AMP LEICESTER 
M. AND AMP S. NAIGAL GRID WOULD NOT BE 
SURPRISED TO SEE THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED DOWN 
ITSELF WE WILL CHECK ON THAT IN A 
MOMENT OTHER NEWS CAME OUT FROM 
CARPHONE WAREHOUSE IT IS SELLING A 
HALF SHARE TO A U. S. FIRM CALLED BEST 
BUY THEY WILL PAY ONE POINT ONE BILLION FOR 
THIS STAKE BEST BUY IT IS THE 
WORLD'S LARGEST CONSUMER 
ELECTRONICS IT OPERATES FROM GIANT 
SUPERSTORES ONE OF THE MAIN 
REASONS PERFORMING THE JOINT 
VENTURE WITH THE CARPHONE WAREHOUSE 
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE FIRST ONE IS 
SCHEDULED TO OPEN IN TWO THOUSAND NINE CARPHONE 
WAREHOUSE CONTINUES TO OWN ALL ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
OF ITS FIXED LINE TELECOMS BUSINESS 
IN THE U. K. THAT IS TALKTALK A. O. L. 
BROADBAND AND MOBILE FRANCE JOINT 
VENTURE HOWEVER ODD THINGS HERE 
CARPHONE WAREHOUSE THEY SAID THEY 
HAD NOT DECIDED WHETHER THEY WOULD 
CHANGE ALL THEIR SHOPS TO BEST BUY 
BRAND PEOPLE AT HEAD OFFICE DID 
NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON IN 
SHOPPING CENTRES THE SHARES ARE 
DOWN TODAY 
IT BUYS A LOT OF COMPANIES IT HAS 
A HUGE INFLUX OF MONEY IS L. THINK 
THEY ARE GOING TO PAY OFF HUGE 
AMOUNT OF DEBT NOT BAD POSITION TO BE AN TO BE IN 
SALES AT NEXT SALES AT NEXT IN THE FIRST QUARTER 
FELL BY THIRTY NINE PER CENT TO SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION 
WITH THE GROUP CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE 
OUTLOOK GIVEN THE SOARING COST OF 
FOOD FUEL MORTGAGES AND TAXES IT 
SHARES ARE ALL DESPITE ITS SHARES 
ARE UP SIGNET THE WORLD'S BIGGEST 
JEWELLERY COMPANY A MASSIVE 
OPERATION HAS COME UP WITH FIRST 
QUARTER SALES LIKE FOR LIKE SALES 
FELL TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER 
HOWEVER THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE 
IF YOU LOOK BEHIND HEADLINE NUMBERS 
IN THE STATES SCALES FELL IN THE 
U. K. SAYS ACTUALLY ROSE SALES 
FELL SALES ACTUALLY AROSE 
I. T. V. ALTHOUGH NO CHANGE HAS BEEN 
HIT WITH RECORD FINE BY OFCOM 
OVER SPATE OF PREMIUM RATE PHONE IN SCANDALS 
NEWSPAPER PUBLISHER TRINITY MIRROR 
SAID THE ADVERTISING ENVIRONMENT 
REMAINS DIFFICULT AND VOLATILE IT 
REPORTED THIRTY ONE PER CENT DECLINE IN 
ADVERTISING DURING THE FIRST SEVENTEEN 
WEEKS OF THE YEAR DESPITE THAT 
GROUP REVENUES ROSE OH THREE PER CENT 
PROBLEMS IN THE ADVERTISING MARKET 
BUT THIS BUT THIS GROUP IS NOT 
DOING TOO BADLY THE F. T. S. E. IS DOWN 
THE SMALLER COMPANIES ARE UP FORTY SEVEN 
I WAS INTERESTED IN THE BOX PUBS 
MACRO DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE BEEN 
SEEKING THAT TAX EFFICIENCY HELP TO 
OFFSET THE IMPACT OF THE SMOKING 
BAN CUE MATT THAT HAS BEEN A BIG 
PROBLEM PROBLEM WHEN THE SMOKING BAN CAME IN LOT 
OF PEOPLE STOPPED GOING TO POT 
THEY WERE HOPING TO BRING IN NEW 
CLIENTS TO EIGHTY LOT MORE OFTEN THE 
PROFIT MARGINS IN THE FOOD WERE 
MUCH BETTER TO EAT LOT MORE 
THE LONG TERM STRATEGY WOULD BE 
GOOD BECAUSE THE MIX OF BUSINESS 
WOULD CHANGE WE HEARD FROM RANK 
YESTERDAY THEY ARE ON A HUGE MAP 
OF BINGO HALLS SAME PROBLEM 
THEY OWNED A HUGE AMOUNT OF BINGO 
HALLS HALLS ROYAL MAIL'S PROFITS HAVE FALLEN BY 
ABOUT THIRD THAT IS THE LOWEST 
FOR FIVE YEARS THE BIGGEST LOSS 
WAS IN THE LETTERS BUSINESS AS MAIL 
VOLUMES FELL THERE WAS SOME GOOD 
NEWS ARISE IN THE NUMBER OF 
PARCELS CHIEF EXECUTIVE AT CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE ADAM CROZIER DESCRIBE IT 
AS A ROBUST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
WE ARE CHUCKING OUT TEN BILLION 
WORTH OF EDIBLE FOOD EVERY YEAR A 
STUDY SHOWS EVERY DAY WE THROW AT 
ONE POINT THREE MILLION ON UP AND YOGHURT POTS 
FIVE THAT FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HALL CHICKENS AND 
FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND READY MEALS THERE HAS BEEN 
A BIG INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF 
COMPANIES OFFER OF IN THEIR PENSION 
SCHEMES TO INSURANCE COMPANIES AND 
THE LAST SIX MONTHS OFFLOADING 
THE BUYOUT MARKET WILL BE WORTH TEN 
BILLION THIS YEAR COMPARED TO JUST 
THREE BILLION LAST YEAR PENSION 
COMPANIES CAN TRANSFER THEIR 
INSURANCE LIABILITIES FOR A ONE OFF 
COST AND PAYOUT BY MOTOR INSURERS 
LOOK THAT THEY WOULD INCREASE IT 
IS BECAUSE OF BIG RISE IN 
PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS THE NUMBER 
OF ROAD ACCIDENTS HAS DROPPED BUT 
THE AMOUNT MOTOR INSURERS HAVE TO 
PAY OUT IS SET TO RISE 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH MEANS BANKS ARE 
BEING MORE CAREFUL WHEN IT COMES TO 
LONDON MONEY THAT HAS PROMPTED 
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FROM YOU ABOUT 
YOUR VIEW YOUR CREDIT RATING 
THAT IS HOW BANKS MEASURE AND 
DECIDE WHAT THEY WILL LEND 
THE FIRST THING TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR 
CREDIT RATING IS THAT THERE IS NO 
ONE RATING EACH LENDER WILL SCORE 
YOU DIFFERENTLY ACCORDING TO THEIR 
OWN STANDARDS AND SCALE SOME MAY 
HAVE YOU AS GOOD RISK SOME AS 
BAD RISK TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
FACTORS ARE TO BE REGISTERED ON THE 
ELECTORAL ROLL AND NOT HAVE ANY 
COURT ORDERS AGAINST YOU WORKING 
ON TO THE PEUGEOT AND HAS BEEN 
REFUSED A MORTGAGE SHE WANTS TO 
KNOW HOW LONG SHE WILL HAVE TO WAIT 
BEFORE SHE CAN APPLY FOR ANOTHER 
SHE DOES NOT WANT TO BEAT REFUSED 
AGAIN SHE DOES NOT WANT TO REFUSAL 
NOTED IN HER REPORT IF THOSE OF 
REFUSALS ARE NOT NOTED ON YOUR 
REPORT ONLY THE NUMBER OF 
APPLICATIONS THAT YOU MAKE EVEN 
LENDERS CANNOT TELL THEN IF A PAST 
APPLICATION LEAD DUE TO TAKE UP AN 
OFFER IF YOU IGNORED IT OR YOU 
WERE REFUSED IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING 
NEGATIVE ON YOUR REPORT THIS 
STATUS SAY MAX DAYS FOR SIX YEARS 
WHAT DO LENDERS LOOK FOR WHEN IT 
COMES TO HOW YOUR REPORT IS BEING 
USED CUE BACK 
ONE ROBERTS IS FROM ONE OF THE AGENCY MANAGING CREDIT REPORTS REPORTS IT USED TO BE THAT HISTORICALLY 
WHEN YOU APPLY FOR CREDIT A SEARCH 
WAS MADE AS MORE PEOPLE ASSERTING 
YOUR CREDIT FILE THE IMPORTANCE OF 
A CERTAIN TERMS OF DETERMINING RISK 
IS GOING DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE IT 
IS FAIRLY INSIGNIFICANT NOW AND IN 
THE NEXT TWO TO FIVE YEARS WILL 
BECOME LARGELY IRRELEVANT RISK 
MANAGERS ARE LOOKING FOR THE NUMBER 
OF SEARCHES AND THE TIME PERIOD 
THEY HAVE BEEN DONE IN IF YOU HAVE 
HAD YOUR CREDIT REPORT SEARCHED TEN 
TIMES LAST SIX HOURS THAT SUGGESTS 
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REFUSING IT 
CREDIT WHY YOU'RE TRYING TO AMASS A 
HUGE AMOUNT OF GOOD BECAUSE YOU 
NEED TO BORROW HEAVILY AND QUICKLY 
THE MANY PEOPLE MANAGE THEIR DEBT 
CAREFULLY BUT EVEN THAT CAN CAUSE 
CONFUSION WHEN IT COMES TO CREDIT 
RATINGS RATINGS MY BANK BARCLAYS OFFERED ME A 
ONE THOUSAND OVERDRAFT AT ZERO PER CENT INTEREST 
NATURALLY I TOOK THEM UP ON THIS 
AND WITH DREW NINE HAD NINETY NINE AND PUT 
IT INTO A SAVINGS ACCOUNT WITH 
TRUE NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE WHY PERSONAL BANKER 
SUGGESTED IT WAS O. K. TO LEAVE MY 
ACCOUNT NEGATIVE BUT IT COULD HAVE 
AN EFFECT ON MY CREDIT RATING CAN 
THIS BE TRUE 
YOU'RE DAFT WOULD SHOW ON A CREDIT 
RECORD BUT IT SHOULD ONLY BE 
DETRIMENTAL TO THE CREDIT RATING OF 
THE AUTHORISED AND IT WAS EXCEEDED 
OVERDRAFT WHAT LENDERS ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT HIS YOU HAVING TOO 
MUCH AVAILABLE CREDIT SAY YOU HAVE 
FIVE CROWTHER CARDS EACH WITH 
TEN THOUSAND LIMIT IF YOU HAVE NOT GOT 
IT PENNY ON THEM AND THE LENDER 
MAY NOT BE KEEN TO LEND CREDIT 
CARDS YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY TO GET 
INTO LOT OF DEBT THERE IS NO 
CLEAR CUT ANSWER WHEN IT COMES TO 
YOUR CREDIT RATING EVEN HAVING NO 
CREDIT AT ALL CAN WORK AGAIN STEW 
BECAUSE LENDERS DO NOT KNOW IF 
YOU'RE A GOOD RISK OR A BAD ONE 
AGAINST YOU WHAT HE CAN DO IS TO 
FIND OUT WHAT IS ON EUROPE WOULD 
THIS CAN BE DONE FOR AS LITTLE AS 
TWO FROM ANY OF THE THREE CREDIT 
REFERENCE AGENCIES WHAT IS ON 
YOUR ACCOUNT FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE 
THAT IS RIGHT EUROPEAN SPACE 
AGENCY IS ADVERTISING FOR NEW 
ASTRONAUT EARLIER I SPOKE TO THE 
REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE EUROPEAN 
SPACE AGENCY AND TOLD HIM ABOUT 
MYSELF WHAT CHANCE DID I HAVE OF 
BECOMING AN ASTRONAUT 
I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE MORE 
INFORMATION THAN THAT BEFORE I GO 
RIISE DESPITE BEFORE I COULD 
REALLY SAY 
WHAT WOULD HAVE 
CREDENTIALS THE NEED 
TO WE'RE BASICALLY LOOKING AT TWO 
COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES THE ONE COMMUNITY IS THE COMMUNITY 
OF RESEARCHERS AND SCIENTISTS 
PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED DEGREES IN 
NATURAL SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERING 
BACK NATURAL SCIENCES NATURAL 
SCIENCES THE OTHER COMMUNITY WE 
ARE LOOKING AT IS THE COMMUNITY OF 
PILOTS WE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIGH LEVEL PILOTING 
EXPERIENCE FLYING JET AIRCRAFT OR 
OF A HIGH PERFORMANCE AIRCRAFT 
OR ALL THEIR HIGH PERFORMANCE 
AIRCRAFT PEOPLE WHO ARE TEST 
PILOTS 
THAT RULES ME OUT AND EVERY PILOTS SINGLE COUNT HOW IMPORTANT IS IT 
FOR THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY T. 
HAVE ACTUAL ASTRONAUTS WE HAVE A 
ROBOTIC SPACE PROGRAMME 
ABSOLUTELY THE FACT OF THE MATTER 
IS WE NEED BOTH ROBOTIC ACTIVITIES 
ARE IMPERATIVE THERE ARE CERTAIN 
TYPES OF WORK IN SPACE THAT CAN ON 
THE BEGUN BY ROBOTS ON THE OTHER 
HAND THERE ARE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES 
THAT ONLY A HUMAN CAN DO WE NEED 
TO REPLENISH OUR ASTRONAUT CORPS 
THE WHEN WILL THESE PROSPECTIVE 
ASTRONAUT BE LAUNCHED INTO SPACE 
I LOST DUE FOR A MOMENT WERE YOU 
ASKING WHEN THE NEXT CLASS WILL BE 
RECRUITED RECRUITED THAT IS RIGHT AND WHEN WILL THEY BE 
IN SPACE 
WE ARE EXPECTING TO HAVE COMPLETED 
THIS ASTRONAUT SELECTION PROCESS BY 
THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 
TWO THOUSAND NINE IT IS LENGTHY PROCESS BUT 
IF YOU CONSIDER THE LARGE NUMBER OF 
APPLICATIONS WE'RE EXPECTING FIVE 
DIGIT FIGURES PERHAPS IT DOES NOT 
SO MUCH OF A SURPRISE ONCE THE 
ASTRONAUTS JOINED THE AGENCY'S 
JOINED THE AGENCY THEY WILL FIRST 
OF ALL UNDERGO S. SERIES OF COURSES 
BASIC TRAINING ADVANCED TRAINING 
MISSION SPECIFIC TRAINING ONCE ALL 
OF THAT IS DONE TYPICALLY WITHIN A 
PERIOD OF ABOUT SEVEN YEARS WE WILL 
EXPECT THIS CLASS TO GO INTO SPACE 
YOU SAY FIVE FIGURES IS THAT TENS 
OF THOUSANDS OF APPLICANTS 
EXACTLY RIGHT BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN WE 
RECRUITED THE SECOND LAST OF 
EUROPEAN ASTRONAUT THIS WAS BEFORE 
THE USE OF THE INTERNET AND 
RECRUITMENT CAMPAIGNS WE HAD 
TWENTY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS NOWADAYS WITH 
THE INTERNET WE ARE EXPECTING 
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE 
WHERE WILL THESE PEOPLE BE GOING IN 
THE END TO FORM A BASE ON THE 
MOON MOON WE ARE HOPING THAT IS WHERE THE 
TRIP WILL EVENTUALLY TAKE THEM 
DISCUSSIONS ARE STILL ONGOING 
REGARDING HER FUTURE MISSIONS BUT 
OUR GOAL IS TO GO TO THE MOON AND 
EVENTUALLY MARS 
WE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH OUR OWN 
COMMUNICATIONS T. U. ON THE OTHER 
SIDE OF THE EARTH THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH BEST OF LUCK 
I SAID HE WAS THE OTHER PART OF THE 
EARTH HE WAS ABOUT FOUR MILES AWAY 
IN THE SCIENCE MUSEUM 
DO YOU THINK IF I WAS YOUR PERSONAL 
SPONSOR I WOULD AGREE TO BLASTED 
INTO SPACE 
SEE YOU TOMORROW BYE BYE
