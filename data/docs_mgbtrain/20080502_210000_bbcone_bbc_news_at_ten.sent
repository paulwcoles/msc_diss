WORST LOCAL ELECTION RESULT FOR FORTY 
YEARS YEARS THEY LOSE HUNDREDS OF COUNCIL SEATS 
AND THEY ARE PUSHED INTO THIRD 
PLACE BEHIND THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
JUBILATION FOR DAVID CAMERON'S 
CONSERVATIVES THEY TAKE A MASSIVE 
FORTY FOUR PER CENT OF THE VOTE ACROSS ENGLAND AND 
WALES WALES I THINK THE RESULTS ARE NOT JUST AL 
VOTE AGAINST GORDON BROWN THEY ARE 
A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS HAS 
BEEN A DISAPPOINTING NIGHT FOR 
LABOUR LABOUR WE HAVE LESSONS TO LEARN FROM THAT 
AND THEN WE WILL MOVE FORWARD 
IN THE RACE FOR LONDON MAYOR STILL 
NO RESULT BUT ALL THE PARTIES 
AGREE IT IS LOOKING GOOD FOR BORIS 
JOHNSON JOHNSON THE DECLARATION SHOULD COME BEFORE 
MIDNIGHT 
ALSO TONIGHT 
TWO MEN ARE JAILED FOR A GAY SEX 
BLACKMAIL PLOT AGAINST A MEMBER OF 
THE ROYAL FAMILY 
ROBERT MUGABE VOWS TO FIGHT ON AS 
ZIMBABWE'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
RESULTS ARE ANNOUNCED 
AND LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL 
BANKY PUTS ON A SHOW AND INVITES US 
TO JOIN IN 
BORIS SETS TO BECOME THE NEXT MAYOR 
TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE POLLS CLOSE THE 
COUNTING CONTINUES 
GOOD EVENING FROM LONDON'S CITY 
HALL WHERE LABOUR IS BRACING ITSELF 
FOR BAD NEWS IN THE ELECTION FOR 
MAYOR OF LONDON THE LATEST SIGNALS 
FROM ALL THE PARTIES BY THE WAY ARE 
THAT BORIS JOHNSON THE 
CONSERVATIVE IS POISED TO END THE 
LONG REIGN OF LABOUR'S KEN 
LIVINGSTONE BUT WE ARE STILL 
WAITING FOR THE FORMAL DECLARATION 
TO SEE IF THE SIGNALS ARE ACCURATE 
WHAT WE DO HAVE ARE THE LOCAL 
ELECTION RESULTS ACROSS ENGLAND AND 
WALES AND IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT 
GORDON BROWN HAS LED LABOUR TO ITS 
WORST LOCAL RESULT FOR FORTY YEARS 
IT HAS BEEN A TRIUMPH FOR DAVID 
CAMERON'S CONSERVATIVES THEY HAVE 
AN EXTRA TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX SEATS ON LOCAL 
COUNCILS LABOUR ENDED UP WITH THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE 
FEWER COUNCILLORS AND THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS GAINED THIRTY FOUR SEATS THE 
SHARE OF THE VOTE IS MORE STARK 
THE CONSERVATIVES TOOK FORTY FOUR PER CENT OF THE 
VOTES CAST LABOUR WERE BEHIND ON 
TWENTY FOUR PER CENT FORCED INTO THIRD PLACE BY THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WHO WON TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
NICK ROBINSON REPORTS 
BORIS THE MAYOR OF LONDON WHAT A 
JOKE THEY SCOFFED TONIGHT THE 
TORIES APPEAR TO BE HAVING THE LAST 
LAUGH THE COUNTING HAS GONE ON 
LONGER BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE VOTED 
THAN EXPECTED WHICH WAS GOOD NEWS 
FOR THE MAN WHO RALLIED THE 
MILITANT SUBURBS OF LONDON 
IT HAS HAS BEEN GOOD AT THE LOCAL 
ELECTION I'M WAITING TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS IN LONDON 
THE ERA OF KEN 
MAYBE AT AN END HE WON FOR THE THE 
FIRST TIME DESPITE THE LABOUR PARTY 
HE MAY NOW OF LOST BECAUSE OF THEM 
IF THE CONSERVATIVES WIN LONDON 
TONIGHT IT WILL BE THEIR BIGGEST 
ELECTION VICTORY SINCE JOHN MAJOR'S 
IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND IT WILL COME ON A DAY 
WHEN DAVID CAMERON'S CONSERVATIVES 
HAVE DONE AS WELL AS TONY BLAIR DID 
JUST BEFORE HE BECAME PRIME 
MINISTER MINISTER TORY VICTORIES LABOUR LOSSES THE 
STORY WAS THE SAME WHETHER IN THE 
NORTH THE SOUTH THE MIDLANDS OR 
IN WALES IN BURY AND PLYMOUTH AND 
NUNEATON AND THE VALE OF GLAMORGAN 
THE CONSERVATIVES ARE IN CHARGE 
IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS HAS 
BEEN A DISAPPOINTING NIGHT BAD 
NIGHT FOR LABOUR WE HAVE LESSONS 
TO LEARN FROM THAT 
AND THEN WE WILL MOVE FORWARD MY 
JOB IS TO LISTEN AND TO LEAD AND 
THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO 
AND WELCOME TO ELECTION NIGHT WITH 
THE RESULTS 
FACED WITH A LONG 
AND MISERABLE NIGHT MINISTERS 
SEARCH FOR THE ODD CRUMB OF COMFORT 
WE WE'VE DONE WELL 
WATCH THE 
REACTION OF A FELLOW LABOUR M. P. WHO 
COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE WAS 
HEARING HEARING RANK AND FILE LABOUR PARTY 
ACTIVISTS ARE SAYING IF WE 
INTERPRET IT THEN THAT WAY WE 
SLEEPWALK TOWARDS TORY GOVERNMENT 
CRITICISM FROM THE LEFT THIS FROM 
THE RIGHT 
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN WIN 
UNDER GORDON BROWN 
IT IS POSSIBLE 
BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE CHANGES WE 
HAVE TO SET OUT OUR POLICY CLEARLY 
HE HAS TO GET A TEAM WHICH IS RIGHT 
WE HAVE TO SEND OUR MESSAGE AND OUR 
PURPOSE IN A MORE CONVINCING WAY 
THAN WE HAVE SO FAR 
THE MAN WHO MAYBE BELIEVING HE IS 
OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER TOURED THE 
PLACES HE HAD WON PLACES THAT HAVE 
NOT BEEN CONSERVATIVE FOR A LONG 
LONG TIME 
I THINK THIS IS A BIG MOMENT FOR 
THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY BUT I DON'T 
WANT ANYONE TO THINK THAT WE WOULD 
DESERVE TO WIN AN ELECTION JUST ON 
THE BACK OF A FAILING GOVERNMENT L. 
WANT US TO REALLY PROVE TO PEOPLE 
THAT WE CAN MAKE THE CHANGES THAT 
THEY WANT TO SEE IN TERMS OF OF 
SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS AND CRIMES 
AND THE OTHER ISSUES THAT THAT 
MATTER TO ALL OF US 
THERE WAS RELIEF FOR THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS NEW LEADER WHO FEARED 
ANOTHER YEAR OF LOSSES GAINS FROM 
LABOUR IN THE NORTH OUTWEIGHED 
LOSSES TO THE TORIES IN THE SOUTH 
IN HULL IN SHEFFIELD IN LIVERPOOL 
IN BURNLEY IN SO MANY OF THE GREAT 
NORTHERN CITIES OF THIS COUNTRY 
THEY ARE BEING RUN BY THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS THAT'S A SEA CHANGE IN 
BRITISH POLITICS 
TONIGHT GORDON BROWN LEFT DOWNING 
STREET KNOWING THAT HAVING PROMISE 
TODAY RENEW LABOUR HE HAD DONE 
WORSE THAN TONY BLAIR EVEN AFTER 
THE COUNTRY HAD TIRED OF HIM AND 
HIS UNSUCCESSFUL WAR 
AS WE HAVE HEARD SOME OF LABOUR'S 
BIGGEST LOSSES WERE IN ITS 
HEARTLANDS INCLUDING SOUTH WALES 
AND THE NORTH OF ENGLAND IN WALES 
THEY LOST THE STRONGHOLDS OF OF OF 
BLAENAU GWENT AND TORFAEN AND THE 
CONSERVATIVES GAINED CONTROL OF 
BURY WHAT DROVE THE VOTERS AWAY 
FROM LABOUR LAURA KUENSSBERG 
REPORTS 
GORDON BROWN HAS BEEN URGED TO 
SMILE MORE IN PUBLIC BUT JUST NOW 
AS WE ARE GETTING USED TO THE SIGHT 
HE MIGHT WONDER IF GRINNING HAS 
BEEN WORTH IT AT ALL 
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THIS JOB TO 
ANYONE ELSE 
I SAY NOT YET 
THAT WAS IN THE GOOD TIMES NOW 
LAUGHTER TURNED TO DESPAIR 
PREVIOUS COUNCIL DEFEATS UNDER TONY 
BLAIR PAIL INTO INSIGNIFICANCE 
FOR FIFTEEN YEARS THEY NEVER HAD ANY 
TORY COUNCILLORS IN ISLINGTON NOW 
THEY HAVE GOT FORTY SEVEN 
NOT SINCE THE DAYS OF HAROLD WILSON 
ANOTHER LABOUR P. M. NOT FOND THE 
PUBLIC PUBLIC GLARE TWO YEARS 
AFTER HIS NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT MELT DOWN WILSON WAS 
OUT OUT ON TOP OF DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER 
GORDON BROWN IS RIGHT FOR THE JOB 
HE HAD TO WRESTLE WITH POLICY 
PROBLEMS TOO ONE VERY MUCH OF HIS 
OWN MAKING 
GORDON BROWN DECIDE TO ABOLISH THE 
TEN PENCE TAX RATE LAST YEAR BUT 
WHEN IT CAME INTO FORCE LAST MONTH 
THERE WAS AN OUTCRY FROM HIS M. P.'S 
ANGRY THAT IT LEFT MANY OF THE 
POOREST WORST OFF THE P. M. CHANGED 
HIS MIND BUT THE DAMAGE WAS DONE 
RECORD PRICES AT THE FUEL PUMP LEFT 
MANY OF US FEELING WORSE OFF AND ON 
TOP OF THAT THE COST OF MANY OF 
OUR BASICS BRED AND BUTTER SOARED 
GORDON BROWN BUILT HIS RECORD ON 
LOOKING AFTER OUR WALLETS BUT HIS 
REPUTATION AS WELL AS THE NATION'S 
FINANCES IS UNDER ATTACK 
NOWHERE WERE THE RESULTS MORE 
DRAMATIC THAN IN WALES LABOUR LOST 
SIX COUNCILS EVEN BLAENAU GWENT 
VOTERS FELT LABOUR HADN'T BEEN 
PULLING ITS WEIGHT 
PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY STRUGGLING 
OVER THE COST OF LIVING IT IS 
GETTING OUT OF PROPORTION TO WHAT 
WE EARN 
THERE IS LOT OF PEOPLE SUFFERING 
PEOPLE HAD ENOUGH OF THEM THEY 
WANT A CHANGE 
COUNCILS HAD CAUSE ADD STINK BY 
GIVING UP COLLECTING THE BINS ON 
WEEKLY BASIS AND AND THERE WAS 
ANGER ABOUT SCHOOL CLOSURES TOO 
BUT THERE WAS BLAME ABOUT THE 
NATIONAL LEADERSHIP 
LABOUR BLAIR OR BROWN OR LABOUR 
BLAIR FOR STARTING THE WAR BUT IT 
DOESN'T MATTER 
CONTROL SLIPPED FROM LABOUR'S GRASP 
IN READING 
THE THE PRICE OF FUEL HAS GONE UP 
THE COST OF LIVING HAS GONE UP 
THEY HAVE NO CONTROL ON IMMIGRATION 
IT IS 
JUST EVERYTHING REALLY L. I JUST WANTED A CHANGE 
HE DOESN'T INSTIL CONFIDENCE IN ME 
AND I'M RUNNING THREE JOBS TRYING 
TO KEEP AFLOAT THAT'S WHY I SAID 
I'M NOT LEAVING MY HOUSE BECAUSE IT 
DOESN'T MATTER WHO IS IN IT 
DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER 
THE TORIES TOOK SEATS FROM LABOUR 
IN MANY PARTS OF THE NORTH 
THE PUBLIC HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE IN 
THE GOVERNMENT OVER THE LAST TWELVE 
MONTHS MONTHS I DIDN'T VOTE YESTERDAY 
WHY NOT JUST JUST DISILLUSIONED WITH EVERYTHING 
WITH LABOUR'S COT VOTE CRUMBLING 
IF IT HAD BEEN GENERAL ECTION 
IF IT WAS A GENERAL ELECTION WE 
WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE 
CONSERVATIVES WINNING A 
PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY IT IS GOOD 
NEWS FOR THE CONSERVATIVES WE 
SHOULD BEAR IN MIND THAT PEOPLE 
DON'T NECESSARILY VOTE IN LOCAL 
ELECTIONS IN THE WAY THEY WOULD IN 
A GENERAL ELECTION 
THERE IS NO OTHER LABOUR FIGURE 
TRYING TO FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE 
P. M.'S HOME FOR NOW 
WHAT A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU 
BUT THERE IS DEMAND FOR VERY 
DIFFERENT GORDON BROWN TO COME 
CALLING FOR YOUR VOTE NEXT TIME 
ROUND 
BACK AT LONDON'S CITY HALL LET'S 
GET THE LATEST ON HOW THE COUNT IS 
PROGRESSING IN THE RACE FOR MAYOR 
OF LONDON WE WERE EXPECTING A 
RESULT BEFORE NOW 
WE ARE GOING TO JOIN JAMES LANDALE 
THERE IS STRONG EXPECTATION THAT 
BORIS JOHNSON IS GOING TO WIN WHY 
DO I SAY THAT THE INFORMATION WE 
ARE GETTING ON THE SCREENS PARTIAL 
RESULTS COMING IN FROM THE COUNTS 
THAT TELL US THAT IN THE FOURTEEN REGIONS 
THAT LONDON HAS BEEN DIVIDED UP 
INTO BORIS JOHNSON IS AHEAD IN 
AROUND EIGHT OF THOSE REGIONS 
CLIVG REGIONS KEN LIVINGSTONE IN 
THE SIX THIS EXPECTATION HAS NOT 
BEEN DEMAND BY THE HIGH COMMANDS IN 
LABOUR OR THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
WITHIN THE LAST HOUR OR SO TESSA 
JOWELL THE MINISTER FOR LONDON 
SAID THAT IT WAS HIGHLY UNLIKELY 
THAT KEN WOULD BE MAYOR BY THE END 
OF THE NIGHT AS TO WHEN WE WILL 
GET A RESULT AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE 
ONLY GOT RESULTS FROM FOUR OUT OF 
FOURTEEN OF THE REGIONS THE REST ARE 
COUNTING OR BEING CHECKED THEY 
HAVE HAD THE ELECTORAL EQUIVALENT 
TO PHOTOCOPIER CRISIS SPOKE TO 
AN OFFICIAL A FEW SECONDS AGO AND 
HE SAID IT IS POSSIBLE WE WILL HAVE 
A RESULT WHILE IT IS FRIDAY 
O. K. JAMES THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
JAMES LANDALE IS INSIDE CITY HALL 
LISTENING TO THAT WITH ME IS NICK 
ROBINSON OUR POLITICAL EDITOR 
NICK IF YOU DON'T LIVE IN LONDON 
WHY SHOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN THE 
RESULT 
YOU MAYBE INTERESTED RESULT BECAUSE IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE MAN 
WHO WAS A SUCCESSFUL HOST OF HAVE I 
GOT NEWS FOR YOU BECOMES LONDON 
MAYOR THAT WILL BE EXTRAORDINARY 
YOU OUGHT TO CARE FOR POLITICAL 
REASONS THIS WILL BE IF IT 
HAPPENS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TORY 
ELECTION VICTORY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO IT 
WILL BE THE FIRST SENIOR TORY TO 
HAVE POWER IN BRITAIN SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
AND IT WILL BE IN A HIGHLY VISIBLE 
PLACE IN THE CAPITAL CITY AND THAT 
WILL MEAN THAT VOTERS WILL BE ABLE 
TO LOOK AT HOW THE CONSERVATIVES 
HANDLE POWER A MAN CHOSEN BY DAVID 
CAMERON A CONTROVERSIAL CHOICE AND 
THEY MAY REACH CONCLUSION ABOUT A 
FUTURE TORY GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT 
OF WHAT HAPPENS HERE 
AS FOR GORDON BROWN LABOUR M. P.'S ARE 
STARTING TO SAY IS THIS THE MAN WE 
WANT TO HAVE LEADING US INTO A 
GENERAL ELECTION WHERE DOES THIS 
LEAVE HIM 
THEY ARE SAYING THAT 
THEY KNOW THERE IS LITTLE THEY CAN 
THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT IT WAS EASY A 
YEAR AGO WHEN LABOUR DID BADLY THEY 
HAD THEIR EXCUSE TONY BLAIR HAD 
OVERSTAYED HIS WELCOME PERHAPS 
PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF HIM THEY TIRED 
OF HIS ASSOCIATION WITH THE AIR 
RACK WAR IRAQ WAR AND AS A 
RESULT ALL THE EASY ANSWERS GONE AS 
WELL THERE IS LITTLE THAT LABOUR 
M. P.'S CAN DO BUT I THINK GORDON 
BROWN WILL FIND IT HARDER TO 
CONTROL THEM NOW HE BELIEVES THE 
EXPLANATION IS CLEAR THAT THIS IS 
ABOUT THE ECONOMY ECONOMIC WORRIES 
AND THE FACT THAT THE PRICE OF 
BREAD IS THE FIRST TIME IN MANY 
YEARS A FEATURE IN A GENERAL 
ELECTION INTERESTINGLY HIS ALLIES 
ARE COMPARING HIM WITH JOHN MAJOR 
NOT THE MAJOR WHO LOST BUT THE 
MAJOR WHO PULLED OFF THE VICTORY 
THE MAN WHO SAID DON'T RISK 
EVERYTHING WITH THE UNTRIED AND 
UNTESTED OPPOSITION LEADER THAT 
WILL BE HIS MESSAGE BUT TODAY'S 
POLLS LOOK LIKE THE MAJOR WHO WENT 
ON TO LOSE SPECTACULARLY 
THERE WILL BE MORE FROM ME LATER

ELECTION RESULTS ARE AVAIL 
AVAILABLE FOR YOU ON THE B. B. C.

ROBERT MUGABE DOES THOUGH HAVE 
ENOUGH VOTES FOR A RE RUN 
IT HAS BEEN FIVE LONG WEEKS SINCE

DECIMATED DECIMATED THE OPPOSITION HAS A DILEMMA IF IT 
DOESN'T CONTEST A RUN OFF IT WILL 
HAND VICTORY BY DEFAULT TO ROBERT 
MUGABE OVER THE WEEKEND IT WILL 
BE THINKING HASHED ABOUT WHAT 
HARD ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT 
THE QUARTET OF MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
NEGOTIATORS THE UNITED STATES THE 
UNITED NATIONS THE EUROPEAN UNION 
AND RUSSIA HAS BEEN MEETING IN 
LONDON IN A STATEMENT IT SAID 
CONDITIONS IN GAZA AND THE WEST 
BANK NEED TO BE IMPROVED 
IT CALLED ON ISRAEL TO STOP 
BUILDING SETTLEMENTS AND HAMAS TO 
STOP FIRING MISSILES INTO ISRAEL 
TONY BLAIR SAID A PEACE DEAL WAS 
POSSIBLE BUT IT WOULD TAKE A LOT 
OF HARD WORK 
THE AMERICAN SIDE AND THE EUROPEAN 
SIDE AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 
QUARTET THERE IS A FOCUS ON THIS 
AND A DETERMINATION TO GET 
SOMETHING DONE THAT HAS NOT BEEN 
PRESENT FOR SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME 
THE ARTIST BANKSY HAS STRUCK AGAIN 
THIS TIME IN A TUNNEL IN LONDON 
AND TURNED IT INTO AN EXHIBITION OF 
STREET ART CONTRIBUTORS HAVE COME 
FROM BRAZIL CANADA AND AUSTRALIA 
TO CREATE WORKS ON THE DIRTY BRICK 
WALLS FROM TOMORROW MEMBERS OF 
THE PUBLIC WILL BE ABLE TO COME AND 
HAVE THEIR OWN STENCILS 
AIR LONDON THOROUGHFARE USED BY 
TAXIS TO GET TO THE OLD EUROSTAR 
TERMINAL AT WATERLOO NOW AN 
EXHIBITION SPACE FOR STREET ARTISTS 
AND THE BEST KNOWN OF THEM IS 
BANKSY THIS IS HIS FIRST 
EXHIBITION FOR SEVERAL YEARS HIS 
WIT IS UNDIMINISHED AND HIS 
IDENTITY AS EVER A CLOSELY 
GUARDED SECRET EVER SINCE HE CAME 
TO PROMINENCE BANKSY HAS 
SUCCESSFULLY ELUDED THE MEDIA MANY 
PEOPLE SEE THIS AS A CONSCIOUS 
MARKETING PLAN TO ENHANCE HIS NAME 
AND REPUTATION L. HAD THE CHANCE TO 
PUT SOME QUESTIONS TO HIM VIA E. 
MAIL MAYBE THAT IS ALSO PART OF 
THE PLAN L. ASKED WHEN WILL THE 
GIMMICKS AND AND WELL WHEN WILL 
YOU REVEAL YOURSELF HIS ANSWER WAS 
CHARACTERISTIC OF WHAT WE KNOW 
ABOUT HIM QUOTING ANOTHER MAVERICK 
ARTIST OSCAR WILDE HE SAID A GOOD 
ARTIST EXIST ONLY IN WHAT THEY MAKE 
AND ARE PERFECTLY AND INTERESTING 
IN WHAT THEY ARE GIMMICKY OR NOT 
WHO BANKSY IS DOES NOT MATTER TO 
THOSE WHO SEE THIS AS SOME OF THE 
MOST EXCITING ART AROUND 
HIS VERY 
EFFECTIVE THAT IS WHAT YOU NEED TO 
BE AS AN ARTIST THERE ARE MILLIONS 
OF ARTISTS TO BE THE ONE THAT HAS 
FOUND A WAY OF BEING EFFECTIVE AND 
STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD IS THE 
TRICK HE HAS DONE IT BRILLIANTLY 
HIS WORK HERE IS SEEN ALONGSIDE 
STREET ARTISTS FROM AS FAR AWAY AS 
AUSTRALIA BRAZIL THE UNITED 
STATES AND MORE CLOSE TO HOME 
HOLLAND AND NORWAY IN AS MUCH AS 
TRADITION EXISTS IN GRAFFITI ART 
THE ARTISTS OFTEN PAINT TOGETHER 
BUT RARELY ON THIS SCALE IN 
CONTRAST TO BANKSY THESE ARTISTS 
DO NOT GUARD THEIR PRIVACY AS 
PRECIOUSLY WHILE THE INSTALLATIONS 
WILL BE REMOVED IN FEW DAYS THE 
ART ON THE WALLS WILL REMAIN IN 
PLACE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS FOR THIS 
MURAL REFLECTING THE CHANGING FACE 
OF POLITICS IN THE CAPITAL 
WE GOT A GAMES THERE OF ONE OF THE 
PEOPLE IN THE NEWS TONIGHT MORE 
NOW ON OUR MAIN STORY THE LOCAL 
AND LONDON ELECTIONS BACK TO HUW 
AT CITY HALL 
STILL NO RESULT HERE AT CITY HALL 
IN THE RACE TO BE MAYOR OF LONDON 
IT IS ABOUT FOURTEEN HOURS SINCE THEY 
STARTED COUNTING NOT EXACTLY A 
RAPID COUNT WE ARE NOW TOLD THAT 
IF WE ARE LUCKY WE WILL GET THE 
RESULT BY MIDNIGHT BUT IN THE PAST 
FEW MINUTES BOTH CONSERVATIVE AND 
LABOUR SOURCES CONFIRMED THEY ARE 
EXPECTING THE CONSERVATIVE BORIS 
JOHNSON TO BE THE NEXT MAYOR OF 
LONDON IF THAT HAPPENS WHAT KIND 
OF MAYOR WOULD HE BE 
HE HAD BEEN DISMISSED AS A JOKE A 
CLOWN BORIS BIBA FOR AN A MAN 
DEFINED BY HIS HAIR BUT HE IS NOW 
POISED TO RUN ONE OF THE WORLD'S 
GREAT CAPITALS IF A LONDON YOU ARE 
MORE LIKELY TO BE MARKED ON OUR 
STREETS THAN IN NEW YORK A POLL AT 
SHE AND UNPLUGGED FREEWHEELING A 
POLITICIAN UNPLUGGED 
I HAVE TO 
FILL AN APPALLING I WOULD HAVE TO 
CREATE AN APPALLING GAFFE TO BLOW 
IT 
BORIS JOHNSON GLIDED FROM ETON IT TO OXFORD 
A DECLARE THE MOTION 
CARRIED AND CLOSE THE HOUSE AT 
MORE RECENTLY HE WAS A JOURNALIST POLITICIAN MADE FAMOUS 
BY APPEARING ON T. V. SHOWS LIKE HAVE 
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU 
HER WILL BE THE 
NEXT PRIME MINISTER 
WE ALL KNOW IT 
IS GOING TO BE YOU COME A BORIS 
BUT THERE WERE GAPS AND APOLOGIES 
HE UPSET LIVERPUDLIANS AND SNIPED 
AT THE CHEF JAMIE OLIVER THE 
RESIDENTS OF NEW GUINEA WERE LINKED 
TO AN ORGY OF CHIEF KILLING HE 
LIED ABOUT AN AFFAIR AND LOST HIS 
JOB THE QUESTION HANGING OVER HIS 
CAMPAIGN WAS HIS BORIS JOHNSON 
SERIOUS DO YOU REALLY WANT TO RUN 
LONDON 
THEY HAVE LOCKED ME OUT LONDON THE ELEVEN BILLION IS AL LOT OF MONEY 
TO PUT BORIS IN CHARGE OF L. 
SUSPECT FROM EVERYTHING I KNOW 
ABOUT HIM HE IS NOT DETAIL MAN 
HE IS NOT SOMEONE WHO WILL MICRO 
MANAGE THAT BUDGET L. SUSPECT IF HE 
DEVELOPS A GREAT STRENGTH IT WILL 
BE THAT HE WILL PUT TO GOOD PEOPLE 
IN TO DO THE WORK FOR HIM HIS HIS FATHER STAN LEE WHO TOLD ME HE 
CAME FROM A LINE OF PLAY ON PERKS 
IS CERTAIN HIS SON WANTS THE JOB 
BLOND TURKS 
I HAVE BEEN AMAZINGLY 
IMPRESSED BY THE DETERMINATION 
WHICH HE HAS SHOWN NO ONE HE HAS 
NOT HAD A DRINK FOR THREE MONTHS 
IF YOU GIVE UP DRINK FOR THREE 
MONTHS YOU HAVE GOT TO BE SERIOUS 
NO TWO HE HAS ESCHEWED A WHOLE LOAD 
OF OBVIOUS JOKES WHICH YOU COULD 
HAVE MADE HE IS A NATURAL HUMORIST 
AS THE CAMPAIGN WENT ON BORIS 
JOHNSON APPEARED MORE DISCIPLINED 
HE SEEMED TO DISCOVER PASSION 
ABOUT BEING THERE WHAT HE HAD 
GOING FOR HIM WAS THAT HE STOOD FOR 
CHANGE AGAINST A MAN WHO HAS BEEN 
IN POWER FOR EIGHT YEARS BORIS BORIS JOHNSON IS EXCITING AND NEW HE IS 
WELL KNOWN HE WILL DO WELL AMONG 
YOUNG PEOPLE L. THINK THEY LIKE THE 
ELEMENT OF BORIS JOHNSON WHICH IS 
LIKE KEN LIVINGSTONE USED TO BE 
IRREVERENT MISCHIEVOUS FUNNY 
BORIS JOHNSON COULD NOW BECOME ONE 
OF THE MOST HIGH PROFILE TORIES IN 
THE COUNTRY BUT IF HE EMBARRASSES 
AND FAILS TO MEASURE UP IT COULD 
DAMAGE DAVID CAMERON'S EFFORTS TO 
REBRAND HIS PARTY SO BORIS JOHNSON 
THE MAN MANY REGARD IT AS A GAMBLE 
BY HIS PARTY COULD BE ABOUT TO 
DELIVER DAVID CAMERON THE MAJOR 
PRIZE OF TORY LONDON BUT BORIS 
MAKES GOOD COPY GOOD T. V. AND IF HE 
IS CROWNED MEYER THERE WILL BE 
THOSE WATCHING FOR EVERY SLIP OR 
MISTAKE IF HE IS CROWNED MAYOR 
OF LONDON 
THAT IS IT FROM CITY HALL TONIGHT 
YOU CAN WATCH CONTINUING COVERAGE 
AND OF COURSE THE MAYORAL RESULT
