TIKKABILLA TOKKABILLA TIKKABILLA TOCK 
WHAT'S THE TIME ON THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
THE BIG HAND IS POINTING DOWN 
TO THE NUMBER SIX 
THAT MEANS IT'S HALF PAST SOMETHING 
THE LITTLE HAND HAS GONE PAST THE NUMBER THREE 
SO TODAY THE CLOCK SAYS IT'S HALF PAST THREE 
BUT WHAT'S THIS UNDERNEATH THE CLOCK 
IT'S A COW AND SOME MAGIC BEANS 
A VERY LONG TIME AGO ABOUT LAST WEEK I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW 
THERE LIVED A MOTHER AND HER SON IN A COTTAGE CALLED NO FUN 
JACK WAS THE BRIGHT YOUNG LAD BUT BOTH MUM AND SON WERE VERY SAD 
A GIANT HAD TAKEN ALL THEIR GOLD WHEN JACK WAS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD 
NOW THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE TABLE TO EAT 
SAVE A TURNIP AND A PIECE OF BEET 
JACK THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO RIGHT NOW 
WHAT SAID JACK NO SELL OUR COW 
TAKE HER TO MARKET GET A GOOD PRICE 
BRING HOME MONEY AND FOOD THAT'S MY ADVICE 
SAD JACK TOOK THE COW ON A LONG REIN AND SLOWLY WENT OFF DOWN THE LANE 
AFTER A MINUTE IT MIGHT'VE BEEN TWO 
JACK HEARD A VOICE CALLING YOO HOO I SAY JACK YES YOU 
JACK SAW A BRIGHTLY DRESSED MAN IN HIS HAND A BRIGHT PAINTED PAN 
GIVE ME YOUR COW THE STRANGE MAN SAID 
AND I'LL GIVE YOU THESE BEANS JACK SHOOK HIS HEAD 
BEANS FOR A COW I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU THINK THAT'S A FAIR SWAP 
THESE ARE NO NORMAL BEANS JACK THEY'RE GREAT THEY'RE TIP TOP 
THEY'RE MAGICAL MARVELLOUS BEANS MY BOY 
GUARANTEED TO BRING YOU BOTH JOY 
IF YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT I'LL TAKE IT RIGHT NOW RIGHT 
THANK YOU THERE WE ARE 
GOODBYE PLEASE TAKE CARE OF THE COW 
H. M. M. 
MAGICAL BEANS SAID MUM WHEN SHE SAW JACK ONCE MORE 
BEANS FOR A COW MY SORE FEET WHAT ARE WE TO DO 
SHE PICKED UP THE BEANS AND OUT OF HER HAND THEY FLEW 
JACK AND MUM WENT TO BED HUNGRY THAT NIGHT 
BUT IN THE DEEP DARK HOURS OH WHAT A SIGHT 
BEAN SHOOTS ROSE AND ROSE FROM THE GROUND 
AND SPREAD UP TO THE SKY WITHOUT A SOUND 
WHEN JACK WOKE NEXT MORN HE THOUGHT IT STRANGE 
THAT IT WAS STILL DARK OUTSIDE 
HE WENT TO REARRANGE THE CURTAINS AND SAW SOMETHING ENORMOUS 
SOMETHING THAT HADN'T BEEN THERE BEFORE 
A GIANT BEANSTALK HUGE A MILE HIGH 
IT DANCED WITH THE CLOUDS IN THE SKY 
I'LL CLIMB IT AND SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING FOR ME 
WHILE MUM STILL SLEPT OUT JACK SILENTLY CREPT 
THEN CLIMBED AND CLIMBED AND CLIMBED AWAY 
IT FELT LIKE HE'D BEEN CLIMBING ALL DAY 
UNTIL POPPING HIS HEAD ABOVE A CLOUD 
HE COULDN'T KEEP FROM SHOUTING OUT LOUD 
A CASTLE A GIANT'S CASTLE I SEE OH WHAT'S INSIDE SOMETHING FOR ME 
HE LOOKED THROUGH THE WINDOWS SPIED A GIANT'S GREAT SHOE 
ATTACHED TO THE SHOE WHAT A TO DO WAS THE GIANT HIMSELF JACK KNEW 
THAT HE HAD TO BE QUIET OR HE MIGHT BECOME THE GIANT'S DIET 
THE GIANT WAS ASLEEP HE LIKED TO SNORE 
IT SOUNDED TO JACK LIKE A HUGE LION'S ROAR 
SUDDENLY JACK HEARD A SCRATCHING AND A SCUFFLING 
THERE BEFORE HIM CLUCKING OUT LOUD WAS A GOOSE I MAY BE WRONG SAID JACK 
BUT I THINK I CAN SEE THAT GOOSE HAS LAID AN EGG FOR ME 
AND THE EGG IF I MAY BE SO BOLD SEEMS TO BE MADE COMPLETELY OF GOLD 
AND THERE'S A HARP AND SOME JEWELS IN A SACK 
IF I TAKE THE WONDROUS THINGS BACK 
MUM AND I WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO HAVE FINE FOOD UPON OUR TABLE 
IN THE SACK JACK PLACED THE GOOSE THE HARP THE EGG AND OFF HE RACED 
BUT OH DEAR AS HE RAN THE HARP BEGAN TO PLAY A SONG 
IT SANG SO LOUDLY THE GIANT AWOKE WHAT WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON 
THE GIANT SPOKE O. I. YOU BOY 
COME BACK WITH MY TREASURE OR IT WILL BE MY PLEASURE 
TO HAVE YOU FOR TEA BRING BACK MY GOLD 
JACK TRIPPED AND TUMBLED ALONG THE HARP CONTINUED TO SING ITS SONG 
CLIMB DOWN THE BEANSTALK THEN TAKE AN AXE 
CHOP DOWN THE BEANSTALK THEM JACK RELAX 
JACK SLID DOWN AS FAST AS HE COULD PULLED HIS AXE FROM A PIECE OF WOOD 
AND CHIPPED AND CHOPPED TILL THE STALK CRASHED DOWN AND THE GIANT 
HE WORE THE DEEPEST FROWN HE WAS STUCK IN THE SKY 
HE HEAVED A GREAT SIGH AND TRUDGED BACK TO HIS CASTLE HOME 
OH THAT WAS THE GIANT THAT TOOK ALL OUR GOLD 
WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWO YEARS OLD 
NOW WE HAVE OUR POSSESSIONS BACK MY BRAVE BOLD CLEVER JACK 
FANCY HAVING MAGIC BEANS WHICH TURN INTO A BEANSTALK AS HIGH AS JACK'S 
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT ANOTHER JACK THROUGH THE WINDOWS 
BUT IT'S NOT JACK SPRATT OR JACK AND HIS FRIEND JILL 
THIS JACK LIVES IN A BOX 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE SQUARE WINDOW 
THIS IS A JACK IN THE BOX 
WHEN YOU OPEN THE BOX THE JACK JUMPS OUT TO SURPRISE YOU 
THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU NEED TO MAKE ONE 
FIRST YOU NEED TO COVER A BOX WITH PRETTY PAPER 
THE BOX NEEDS A LID FOR THE JACK TO HIDE UNDER 
THEY USE A SCREWDRIVER 
TO PUT IN HINGES AT THE BACK SO THE LID CAN LIFT UP AND DOWN 
AND A LATCH AT THE FRONT WHICH YOU USE TO OPEN THE BOX 
NOW THE BOX IS READY IT'S TIME TO START WORK ON THE JACK 
THE PERSON WHO JUMPS OUT OF THE BOX 
SUE PAINTS HIS FACE VERY CAREFULLY ONTO THIS PIECE OF WOOD 
NOW IT'S TIME TO GIVE JACK HIS CLOTHES 
THEY'RE SEWN TOGETHER ON THIS SEWING MACHINE 
HE HAS A LONG SHIRT AND A HAT WITH POMPOMS ON IT 
NOW HIS HAT'S READY IT CAN BE STUCK ONTO HIS HEAD 
H. M. M. WHAT'S THAT 
AH IT'S CALLED A SPRING AND IT'S WHAT MAKES HIM JUMP OUT OF THE BOX 
THIS BELL IS HIDDEN UNDERNEATH THE BODY SO THAT IT MAKES A NOISE 
WHEN HE JUMPS OUT OF THE BOX 
THE SHIRT GOES OVER THE SPRING TO MAKE JACK'S BODY 
THAT'S FUNNY 
JACK IN THE BOX AREN'T THEY GREAT 
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A POP UP TOY LIKE THIS ONE 
READY 
OOH AH OOH GOOD ISN'T IT 
NOW HOW WE MAKE THIS IS I'VE GOT A PAPER PLATE 
AND I'VE CUT AROUND IT 
AND UNDERNEATH IS SOME CREPE PAPER 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHAPE THAT IS CAN YOU GUESS 
IT'S A CIRCLE SHAPE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH MY CIRCLE SHAPE IS 
I'M GOING TO CUT IT INTO TWO I'LL CUT IT 
IN HALF 
LIKE THAT 
RIGHT UP THE MIDDLE 
NOW I ONLY NEED ONE HALF SO I'LL PUT THE OTHER HALF OVER THERE 
I'LL TURN MY HALF A CIRCLE AROUND 
AND I'LL TAKE THIS TAKEAWAY CUP HERE 
I'VE PAINTED IT A NICE YELLOW COLOUR 
THE FIRST THING I'LL DO IS THIS 
I'LL PUSH MY PENCIL RIGHT IN 
IT'S O. K. I MEANT TO DO THAT MAKE A BIG HOLE 
IN THE BOTTOM OF IT 
LITTLE THAT NOW TURN IT OVER 
TAKE SOME GLUE 
AND PUT SOME GLUE AROUND THE EDGE OF THE CUP 
LIKE THAT 
LOTS OF GLUE ROUND THE EDGE OF THE CUP 
WHICH IS CALLED THE LIP OF THE CUP OR THE RIM THERE'S THE RIM 
LOTS AROUND THE RIM TOO 
NOW WHEN YOU'VE DONE THAT YOU WANT TO LIE THE CUP ON THE HALF CIRCLE 
AND PRESS IT DOWN SO THAT THE PAPER STICKS TO THE CUP LIKE THAT 
AND ROLL THE CUP AROUND 
STICK IT DOWN 
AND WITH THE BIT THAT'S LEFT OVER 
YOU PUT SOME MORE GLUE ON THE END 
WHAT DOES THAT REMIND YOU OF CAN YOU THINK 
IT LOOKS LIKE A. M. M. M. LOOKS LIKE AN ICE CREAM CONE 
BUT I'M NOT MAKING AN ICE CREAM CONE TODAY I'M MAKING A POP UP TOY 
SO THE NEXT THING WE NEED IS A STRAW LIKE THIS IF IT'S GOT A BENDY END 
MAKE SURE THE BENDY END IS AT THE BOTTOM LIKE THAT 
I'M GOING TO PUSH THE STRAW THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP 
UNTIL IT'S JUST PEEKING OUT OF THE TOP THERE 
NOW NEXT WE NEED SOME STICKY TAPE TO KEEP THE STRAW IN PLACE 
NOW I NEED SOMETHING TO GO ON THE TOP OF MY POP UP TOY DON'T I 
OR YOU COULD CUT OUT A PHOTOGRAPH 
YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS DON'T YOU 
YES IT'S TAMBA 
I'M GOING TO PUT TAMBA ON THE FRONT OF MY TOY WITH A BIT OF STICKY TAPE 
SO THERE WE ARE 
TAMBA ON THE FRONT OF THE TOY
