HI THERE THIS IS NEWSROUND AND 
THESE ARE TUESDAY'S HEADLINES 
THE COUNTRY OF BURMA IS IN CRISIS 
AFTER ITS WORST CYCLONE IN YEARS BEEN KILLED AND MANY 
MORE ARE MISSING OR HAVE BEEN HURT 
AFTER HIGH WINDS AND RAIN BATTERED 
THE COUNTRY OF BURMA IN SOUTH EAST 
ASIA OVER THE WEEKEND LAURA'S 
BEEN FINDING OUT MORE 
THIS WAS THE MOMENT THE CYCLONE HIT 
IT TORE ACROSS BURMA LEAVING 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NINE YEAR 
OLD CHATAM AND HIS BROTHER LOGAN 
WERE ON HOLIDAY THERE AT THE TIME 
AT FIRST I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS 
A CYCLONE L. THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A 
REALLY BAD STORM AFTER MY PARENTS 
HAD TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A 
CYCLONE 
AND I TOOK A LOOK 
AND I TOOK A LOOK 
AROUND 
AND I REALISED IT WAS A CYCLONE 
HELP IS NOW ON ITS WAY BUT IT'S 
GOING TO TAKE 
A WHILE TO GET TO THE 
PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST IT'S A 
HUGE COUNTRY AND MILLIONS OF 
PEOPLE LIVE IN PLACES WHICH ARE 
DIFFICULT TO GET TO YOU DON'T 
OFTEN HEAR MUCH ABOUT BURMA WE 
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT A LOT ON 
NEWSROUND AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE 
DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHAT 
GOES ON THERE IT'S A VERY 
SECRETIVE COUNTRY WHICH IS RUN BY 
MILITARY GENERALS NOT A GOVERNMENT 
LIKE WE HAVE HERE AND ON THE WHOLE 
THEY DON'T LIKE PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE 
BURMA GETTING INVOLVED IN WHAT GOES 
ON THERE BECAUSE OF THAT SOME 
PEOPLE HAD WORRIED THAT THEY 
WOULDN'T ACCEPT HELP FROM OTHER 
COUNTRIES NOW BUT THE GENERALS 
HAVE SAID THEY DO NEED AS MUCH HELP 
AS THEY CAN GET IT'S GOING TO BE A 
BIG JOB THOUGH AND EXPERTS SAY 
THAT EVEN WITH LOTS OF HELP IT 
WILL TAKE SOME PARTS OF BURMA YEARS 
TO RECOVER FROM THIS TERRIBLE STORM

VERY COOL BUT NOT THE KIND OF 
THING YOU COULD WEAR FOR SCHOOL 
THOUGH HEY 
ON A SUNNY DAY LIKE THIS CYCLING 
IS SURELY THE MOST FUN WAY TO GET 
TO SCHOOL BUT BY THE SOUNDS OF 
THINGS MOST OF YOU LOT AREN'T 
ALLOWED TO BIKE TO AND FROM CLASS 
HELEN'S GOT THE STORY 
PLAYING ON YOUR BIKE IS A BRILLIANT 
WAY TO SPEND AN AFTERNOON AND YOU 
WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE A POPULAR 
WAY TO GET TO SCHOOL BUT ACTUALLY 
HARDLY ANY KIDS IN THE U. K. REGULARLY 
CYCLE TO SCHOOL ABOUT HALF OF YOU 
WANT TO BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED 
PARENTS RECKON SETTING OFF ON YOUR 
BIKE ALONE IS TOO DANGEROUS SO 
THEY STOP YOU 
QUICK QUESTION HOW MANY OF YOU 
REGULARLY CYCLE TO SCHOOL 
NO L. 
DON'T RIDE TO SCHOOL RIGHT NOW 
BECAUSE MY MUM THINKS IT'S SO 
DANGEROUS THEY THINK I MIGHT GET 
HIT BY A CAR 
I TAKE MY BIKE TO 
SCHOOL THREE TIMES OUT OF FIVE IN A 
WEEK AND I ALWAYS GO IN A BIPLANE 
DO YOUR PARENTS WORRY ABOUT YOU 
SOMETIMES THEY WORRY ABOUT ME 
IN A BIKE LANE 
SOMETIMES YOU CAN 
BE RIDING AND YOU TURN A CORNER 
AND SOME DANGEROUS PERSON HITS YOU 
I HAVE MOVED HOUSE AND I LIVE 
FURTHER AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL AND 
IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS IF I RIDE TO 
SCHOOL ON MY OWN AND IT WOULD BE A 
BIT SCARY BECAUSE THE CARS AROUND 
HERE DRIVE REALLY FAST AND THERE 
HAS BEEN A COUPLE OF ACCIDENTS AND 
IT IS BIT WORRYING KNOWING THAT IT COULD BE YOU 
LOTS OF YOU CYCLE 
BUT CLOSER TO HOME AND ONLY WHERE 
YOUR PARENTS CAN SEE YOU WHAT DO 
YOU RECKON SHOULD YOU BE ALLOWED 
TO CYCLE TO SCHOOL HAVE YOUR SAY 
ON THE WEBSITE
