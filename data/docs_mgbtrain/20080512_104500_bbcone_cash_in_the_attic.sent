AND THEN HELPS YOU SELL THEM AT AUCTION TODAY I'M IN BERKSHIRE 
I'VE STOPPED OFF ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF BRACKNELL TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THIS FANTASTIC MANSION 
SOUTH HILL PARK MANSION WAS BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY AND OVER THE YEARS HAS SERVE MANY ROLES FROM GRAND FAMILY HOME 
TO WAR TIME HOSPITAL FROM LUXURY FLATS TO A HIGHLY REGARDED ARTS CENTRE 
BUT ONE CONSTANT OVER THE YEARS HAS BEEN 
THE LARGE NUMBER OF GHOST SIGHTINGS WHICH MAKE THIS 
ONE OF THE MOST HAUNTED PROPERTIES IN ENGLAND 
SPOOKY WELL LET'S HOPE THE ONLY THINGS JUMPING OUT AT US TODAY ARE ANTIQUES AND COLLECTABLES 
THAT WILL FETCH FRIGHTENINGLY HIGH PRICES WHEN THEY GO UNDER THE HAMMER AT AUCTION 
COMING UP ON TODAY'S CASH IN THE ATTIC SOMETHING THAT I TAKE A FANCY TO 
LORNE I SEE MENTION SHOES AND LORNE WILL COME RUNNING 
A RARE SIGHTING FOR JOHN 
A HA I BET YOU'VE NEVER QUITE SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE 
AND AT AUCTION WE'RE ALL PUT TO THE TEST 
O. K. SO EVERYONE'S WRONG THERE WE GO 
NOBODY GOT THAT ONE RIGHT 
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TODAY'S COLLECTABLES GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
I'M ON MY WAY TO MEET MIRIAM WOOD 
NOW SHE'S CALLED IN THE CASH IN THE ATTIC TEAM 
TO HELP HER RAISE A NOTE OR TWO FOR THE NEXT GENERATION 
THIS BEAUTIFUL AREA OF THE HOME COUNTIES IS HOME TO MUSIC THERAPIST MIRIAM 
SHE'S SPENT THE LAST FEW YEARS WORKING TO RAISE MONEY FOR A FAMILY VERY CLOSE TO HER HEART 
SHE'S HOPING HER HOUSE WILL OFFER UP VALUABLES TO TAKE TO AUCTION 
AND HAS ASKED HER FRIEND CHRISTINE TO COME ALONG 
MORNING JOHN MORNING LORNE WHAT HAVE WE GOT IN STORE TODAY 
WELCOME TO SUNNY BRACKNELL WHICH IS A SAXON WORD FOR BRACKEN COVERED HIDING PLACE 
WE'VE GOT TO FIND PLENTY OF COLLECTABLES 
YES BECAUSE AN ANTIQUE IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE BUSH 
O. K. WELL IF YOU WANT TO START SEARCHING I'LL MEET THE FAMILY COME ON 
A HA 
OH GOOD MORNING OH HELLO 
YOU MUST BE MIRIAM THAT'S RIGHT AND THIS IS YOUR HOME 
YES AND CHRISTINE YOU'RE MIRIAM'S FRIEND 
THAT'S RIGHT YOU CALLED IN CASH IN THE ATTIC SO WHAT DO YOU WANT US FOR 
WELL MY FRIEND CALLED OMARNUCIA VERY SADLY SHE WAS TAKEN ILL WITH CANCER IN TWO THOUSAND 
AND IT WAS BREAST CANCER BUT THEN THREE YEARS LATER 
UNFORTUNATELY IT CAME BACK AGAIN AS BONE CANCER 
AND SADLY SHE DIED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR 
SO NOW I WANT TO HELP HER CHILDREN WITH THE THINGS 
THAT SHE WAS INTERESTED IN WHICH WAS PROVIDING THEM WITH MUSIC LESSONS 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOVELY PLAN BUT HOW MUCH ARE WE GOING TO NEED 
WELL FIVE HUNDRED WOULD BE GOOD 
O. K. ALL RIGHT NOW YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY TAKING PART IN THE RUMMAGE TOO 
I AM YES IS THERE LOTS TO GO THROUGH 
QUITE A BIT O. K. WELL IN THAT CASE IF WE NEED TO RAISE FIVE HUNDRED 
FOR MUSIC LESSONS FOR THREE GIRLS I THINK MAYBE WE HAD BETTER GET ON SO COME ON FOLLOW ME O. K. 
PLENTY TO DO TODAY TO RAISE EVERYONE'S SPIRITS AND FIND LOTS OF COLLECTABLES TO TAKE TO AUCTION 
IT LOOKS LIKE JOHN'S HIT THE RIGHT KEY WITH THE FIRST FIND OF THE DAY 
AH JOHN OUR TROPHY HUNTER HAS FOUND SOMETHING ALREADY HOORAH WHAT'S THAT 
WELL IT'S NOT THE HOLY GRAIL BUT IT IS AN INTERESTING ITEM 
AND I'M HOPING MIRIAM YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THERE'S NO INSCRIPTION ON IT 
YEAH THAT WAS WON BY MY GRANDFATHER AND HE WON IT FOR GROWING ROSES 
FASCINATING WHAT A TALENTED MAN WELL IT DOES HAVE A LITTLE SHIELD 
ON THE FRONT THERE WHICH SAYS NINETEEN OH NINE SO WAS THAT THE DATE AND IS THIS YOUR GRANDFATHER 
THAT'S MY GRANDFATHER ROBERT DAVIES 
THE HALLMARK ON THE SIDE TELLS US IT WAS ASSAYED IN LONDON IN NINETEEN OH SEVEN 
SO IT TIES IN PERFECTLY RIGHT STANDARD SILVER CUP NICE THAT IT'S RETAINED ITS PLINTH 
IT'S GOT A MAKER'S INITIAL THERE MW DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT 
WELL THAT STANDS FOR MAPPIN AND AMP WEBB AND IT'S ALSO UNDERNEATH THERE IN FULL 
MAPPIN AND AMP WEBB LONDON OH RIGHT YEAH I NEVER LOOKED UNDER THERE 
WELL THEY ARE A VERY PRESTIGIOUS SILVERSMITHS SILVER MAKER 
THEY HAD ROYAL WARRANTS IN FACT THEY STILL ARE SILVERSMITHS TO THE QUEEN AND TO PRINCE CHARLES 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK WE MIGHT GET FOR IT 
I'D SAY AT AUCTION THESE DAYS ABOUT FORTY TO SIXTY FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S GOOD 
WHAT DO YOU THINK MIRIAM IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH FOR IT TO GO IN YES 
THAT CAN GO INTO THE SILVER FUND AND WE'LL SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN FIND COME ON 
WITH MAPPIN AND AMP WEBB HAVING THE ROYAL SEAL OF APPROVAL THIS TROPHY SHOULD SELL WELL AT AUCTION 
SOME OF MIRIAM'S FRIENDS HAVE KINDLY DONATED ITEMS TO HELP HER WITH THE CAUSE 
ONE OF THESE COMES IN THE FORM OF THIS GLORIOUS VINERS FIFTY EIGHT PIECE CANTEEN SET 
WHICH JOHN ESTIMATES COULD REACH BETWEEN EIGHTY AND ONE HUNDRED 
WE HAVE PLENTY TO DO TO HIT THE MAGIC NUMBER 
AND I'M HOPING MY NEXT FIND WILL GIVE US A MUCH NEEDED BOOST 
ESTIMATED AT THIRTY TO FORTY THIS HANDSOME STANDING LAMP IS GILT WOOD 
AND HAS BEEN DONATED BY A FRIEND 
BEST FRIEND CHRISTINE IS KEEPING UP THE HARD WORK UPSTAIRS 
JOHN COME AND HAVE A LOOK AT THESE 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE 
I THINK THEY BELONGED TO MIRIAM'S MOTHER 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THIS ONE HERE IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE ENGAGEMENT RING OF THE THREE RINGS 
INSIDE IT'S MARKED EIGHTEEN CARAT AND PLATINUM AND WE'VE GOT FIVE DIAMONDS IN THE TOP THERE 
IT'S QUITE STEPPED IT'S VERY VERY ART DECO.ZERO POINT ONE NINE THREE ZEROS 
SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY TIE IN WITH WHEN MIRIAM'S PARENTS GOT MARRIED 
DO YOU THINK MIRIAM WOULD BE HAPPY FOR US TO SELL HER MOTHER'S ENGAGEMENT AND WEDDING RINGS 
I THINK SHE'D BE FINE ABOUT IT SHE'S SPOKEN BEFORE AND SAID 
THAT HER MOTHER WOULD BE QUITE HAPPY ANYWAY FOR IT TO GO TO SUCH A GOOD CAUSE 
IF I HAD TO PUT A VALUE ON THOSE I RECKON WE'D BE LOOKING AT ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY FOR THOSE TWO TOGETHER 
AND ABOUT SIXTY OR SO FOR THE ENGAGEMENT RING 
ONE RING WAS MY MOTHER'S ENGAGEMENT RING 
AND BECAUSE THAT'S GOT QUITE A LOT OF SENTIMENTAL VALUE 
YOU KEEP THEM IN A BOX AND I LOOK AT THEM NOW AND AGAIN 
AND THEY'RE NEVER WORN SO SOMETHING USEFUL MAY COME FROM THEM 
TO VALUE A DIAMOND THE CARAT WEIGHT CUT COLOUR AND CLARITY ARE ALL TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT 
LET'S HOPE THIS ONE RINGS TRUE FOR MIRIAM AND BRINGS HER GOOD FORTUNE AT AUCTION 
AS WE CONTINUE OUR SEARCH OF HER HOME JOHN SEEKS OUT THE NEXT FIND 
A RED PAINTED POTTERY TEA SET 
ESTIMATED TO REACH BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY 
WHILE MIRIAM AND I SIFT THROUGH HER BOXES IT SEEMS A GOOD TIME TO FIND OUT 
MORE ABOUT HER AND HER PASSION TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE MUSICAL EDUCATION 
OF HER FRIEND'S DAUGHTERS 
THERE'S DEFINITELY A MUSICAL THEME HERE ISN'T THERE 
YES WELL I SUPPOSE THAT GOES ALONG WITH YOU BEING A MUSIC THERAPIST SO TELL ME WHAT THAT INVOLVES EXACTLY 
WELL I WORK WITH PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES 
AND I USE MUSIC I USE SOUND 
AND I LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS THEY MAKE 
AND I INTERACT WITH THEM 
AND IT CAN HELP PEOPLE TO DEVELOP CONCENTRATION 
RELIEVE TENSION 
IF THEY'VE HAD A BEREAVEMENT IT CAN HELP THEM DEVELOP SPEECH 
SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GIRLS THAT YOU'RE NOW INVOLVED WITH 
THE OLDEST GIRL IS WANTING TO PURSUE SINGING MORE 
AND THE LITTLE ONE IS JUST LEARNING THE VIOLIN SO MAYBE 
SHE'S LEARNING AT SCHOOL AT THE MOMENT BUT PERHAPS SHE CAN HAVE INDIVIDUAL LESSONS 
THE MIDDLE ONE ALSO PROBABLY WILL BE TRAVELLING WITH AN ORCHESTRA 
SO THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS WE CAN SPEND THE MONEY 
WELL THERE ALWAYS ARE LOTS OF WAYS TO SPEND MONEY MAKING IT IS THE KEY 
SO SHALL WE GO AND SEE HOW THE OTHERS ARE DOING 
YES O. K. COME ON THEN 
THIS IS SUCH A WORTHWHILE CAUSE SO WE MUST RAISE ALL THE CASH WE CAN 
LET'S GET BACK TO THE SEARCH 
AS THE RUMMAGE CONTINUES JOHN SHOWS HIS EXPERTISE 
SPOTTING THESE THREE GOLD RINGS 
EACH WITH A DIFFERENT STONE OF A RUBY DIAMOND AND PEARL 
THEY'VE BEEN GENEROUSLY DONATED BY A FRIEND OF UMA'S TO HELP MIRIAM WITH HER CAUSE 
TOGETHER THEY COULD FETCH UP TO EIGHTY 
CHRISTINE IS HITTING THE HIGH NOTE AGAIN WITH THIS SILVER PLATED CUTLERY SET VALUED AT THIRTY TO FORTY 
AND IN THE LIVING ROOM 
JOHN'S DISCOVERED SOMETHING THAT GRABS ALL OUR ATTENTION 
LADIES MIRIAM COME HERE 
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS FASCINATING PAIR OF LEATHER BOOTS WE'VE GOT HERE 
LORNE I SEE MENTION SHOES AND LORNE WILL COME RUNNING 
CLOGS I THINK THEY ARE CLOGS I THINK THEY'RE CLOGS 
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE VERY COMFORTABLE 
LOOKING AT THEM I THINK UNLIKE THE SONG MADE POPULAR BY NANCY SINATRA 
THESE BOOTS WERE CERTAINLY NOT MADE FOR WALKING 
I WORE THEM ONCE YOU NEVER DID 
MY MUM AND DAD HELD ME UP ON EITHER SIDE WITH THEM ON AND I TODDLED ALONG 
WAS IT A PUNISHMENT 
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY HOW OLD WERE YOU BECAUSE THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY WEENY 
IT WAS PRE WALKING I COULDN'T ACTUALLY WALK BY MYSELF 
IF I WAS TRYING TO DATE THESE SHOES I WOULD SUGGEST THEY ARE VICTORIAN 
THEY'RE THE LATTER HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND A COUPLE OF THINGS SUGGEST THAT TO ME 
THE WOODEN HEELS 
ALSO THE METAL EYE FOR LACES AND SO ON 
WAS ALSO MADE POPULAR AROUND THE SAME SORT OF PERIOD 
LET'S GUESS AT WHAT WE THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORTH 
MIRIAM YOU FIRST WHAT DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY WOULD PAY FOR THESE OH DEAR 
TWENTY O. K. CHRIS 
ABOUT FORTY FORTY I WAS GOING TO SAY FORTY TO SIXTY ESTIMATE 
WELL I'M NOT GOING TO COMMIT MYSELF TODAY 
I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU WAIT UNTIL THE AUCTION 
THEN I'LL GIVE YOU MY OPINION AND WE'LL SEE WHO'S CLOSEST 
WE KNOW THE SHOE FITS IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE HAD SOME GLOVES TO FIT TOO 
SHALL WE GO AND SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN FIND COME ON O. K. 
WHETHER THEY FETCH TWENTY OR SIXTY I SHOULDN'T THINK WE'LL COME ACROSS ANOTHER PAIR OF THESE ANY TIME SOON 
THE HUNT CONTINUES AND JOHN TAGS ANOTHER FIND FOR AUCTION 
THIS DELICATE ROYAL OSBOURNE EIGHTEEN PIECE TEA SET 
WITH GOLD EDGES COULD BRING IN UP TO THIRTY 
AS THE RUMMAGE DRAWS TO A CLOSE I FIND SOMETHING SO SPECIAL 
IT COULD MAKE A NATURE ENTHUSIAST GO ALL MISTY EYED 
AH JOHN THIS COULD MAKE A NICE PHOTOGRAPH 
YOU'RE MOCKING ME LORNE AREN'T YOU NO I'M NOT I'M SERIOUS REALLY 
I BET YOU'VE NEVER QUITE SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK IT'S BINOCULARS AND A CAMERA 
WHERE DID THESE COME FROM MIRIAM 
WELL THEY WERE GIVEN TO MY HUSBAND BY A FRIEND WHO KNEW HE WAS A BIRD WATCHER 
SO HAS YOUR HUSBAND NEVER USED THEM 
I DON'T THINK SO NO I THINK IT WAS A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED FOR HIM 
DID HE REALISE THAT HE'S A VERY SIMPLE MAN MOST ARE DARLING MOST ARE 
DID HE REALISE THERE WAS A CAMERA THERE 
YEAH BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT YOU SEE RIGHT 
SO HOW DO YOU USE IT JOHN 
OOH LOOK YOU CAN SEE THE FILM GOES IN THE BOTTOM THERE 
THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
I CAN'T RECALL EVER SEEING ANYTHING LIKE THEM 
AND I HAVE HEARD OF THE MAKER BEFORE MOELLER WEDEL 
IT'S A GERMAN COMPANY STARTED IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTIES 
NEAR THE TOWN OF EDEL AND STILL IN PRODUCTION TODAY IN FACT 
WHAT SORT OF VALUE DO YOU THINK YOU COULD PUT ON IT AS AN ESTIMATE 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY BUT I'VE SEEN EARLY CAMERAS AND EVEN LATE CAMERAS UNUSUAL CAMERAS 
MAKING HUNDREDS OF POUNDS THESE DAYS 
SOMETHING UNUSUAL A BIT QUIRKY TENDS TO BE VERY POPULAR WITH COLLECTORS 
I'D BE SURPRISED IF THEY MADE LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AT AUCTION OOH 
THAT SOUNDS GOOD ARE YOU HAPPY TO SELL IT AT THAT 
YEAH I THINK SO THAT'S A GREAT RESULT BUT WE'VE RUN OUT OF TIME 
SO CHRISTINE ARE YOU THERE 
WE'VE ENDED ON A VERY GOOD NOTE HERE ONE HUNDRED FOR THOSE THAT'S NOT BAD IS IT RIGHT 
NOW YOU WANTED FIVE HUNDRED DIDN'T YOU 
I MEAN HOW DO YOU FEEL THE VALUATIONS HAVE BEEN GOING TODAY 
WELL QUITE WELL REALLY 
I'M QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE I WAS QUITE WORRIED BEFOREHAND 
THINKING HAVE I GOT ANYTHING WORTH ANYTHING 
I CAN'T INCLUDE THE SHOES UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE 
BUT THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE GOING TO AUCTION COMES TO A TOTAL OF 
FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY 
WOW 
OH 
SO ONLY TWENTY UNDER YOUR TARGET FIGURE AND I'M SURE I'M SURE JOHN 
YOU CAN BREAK WITH TRADITION TO CONFIRM THE SHOES WILL MAKE MORE THAN TWENTY QUID 
NO MY LIPS ARE GOING TO REMAIN SEALED YOU'RE GONNA SPOIL THE BET 
FROM EXPERIENCE I KNOW WE'LL NEVER GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER OUT OF JOHN 
BEFORE AUCTION DAY SO LET'S REMIND OURSELVES WHAT ELSE IS GOING UNDER THE HAMMER 
THE FULL EIGHT PIECE SETTING SILVERY CUTLERY SET BY VINERS OF SHEFFIELD 
COULD BRING IN ANYTHING BETWEEN EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED 
VALUED BETWEEN NINETY AND ONE HUNDRED THESE THREE BEAUTIFUL RINGS 
BELONGED TO MIRIAM'S MOTHER ONE OF THEM IS ART DECO IN STYLE 
LASTLY THE FANTASTIC BINOCULARS WITH A BUILT IN CAMERA 
ESTIMATED TO FETCH ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THEY'LL BE A VERY RARE SIGHTING AT AUCTION 
STILL TO COME ON CASH IN THE ATTIC 
AS MIRIAM'S YOUNG MUSICIANS TURN UP IN FORCE JOHN STARTS TO FEEL THE PRESSURE 
NO TROPHIES FOR MY VALUATION THERE IS THERE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
AND WE ARE ALL BLOWN AWAY BY THE EVENTS OF THE DAY 
GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME 
FIND OUT HOW OUR ANTIQUES FARE WHEN THE FINAL HAMMER FALLS' 
NOW IT'S BEEN A FEW WEEKS SINCE WE HAD A GOOD LOOK AROUND MIRIAM WOOD'S HOME IN BRACKNELL BERKSHIRE 
AND WE FOUND MANY COLLECTABLES TO BRING HERE 
TO GOLDING YOUNG AUCTION HOUSE IN GRANTHAM IN LINCOLNSHIRE 
NOW REMEMBER MIRIAM IS LOOKING TO RAISE AROUND FIVE HUNDRED 
TOWARDS SOME MUSIC LESSONS FOR THREE VERY SPECIAL GIRLS 
SO LET'S JUST HOPE THAT THE BIDDERS ARE IN TUNE WITH OUR VALUATIONS WHEN OUR ITEMS GO UNDER THE HAMMER TODAY 
ON THE BORDER OF LEICESTERSHIRE AND LINCOLNSHIRE 
THIS AUCTION HOUSE ATTRACTS COLLECTORS FROM THE MIDLANDS 
I SOON SEE JOHN IN THE MIDST OF THEM HAVING ONE LAST LOOK AT THOSE UNIQUE CAMERA BINOCULARS' 
NO NO NO PICTURES NO PICTURES 
JUST RECONNAISSANCE WORK ON THE AUCTION ROOM THERE LORNE SEEING WHAT I CAN SPOT

I'VE NEVER KNOWN ANYTHING LIKE THEM SO IN TERMS OF VALUE THEY'RE AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY TO ME 
NOW WHAT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT PRICE ARE YOU PUTTING ON THOSE LOVELY SHOES 
YES THE SHOES THEY WERE GREAT 
BUT I'M AFRAID MY LIPS WILL REMAIN SEALED UNTIL THE OTHERS ARE HERE 
WELL IN THAT CASE LET'S GO AND FIND THEM COME ON

AS THE MUCH ANTICIPATED CHILDREN'S BOOTS COME UP I WONDER WHAT THE BIDDERS WILL MAKE OF THEM 
FINALLY YOU'VE GOT TO TELL US THE ESTIMATE ON THOSE SHOES

WELL I WAS NEAREST WELL YOU WERE 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE MY JOB IS DONE ABSOLUTELY 
THESE BOOTS WERE NOT MADE FOR WALKING WERE THEY 
SAD ONE THAT BUT THERE WE ARE 
THAT'S THE END OF THE STORY 
IT'S A SHAME THOSE BOOTS DIDN'T MAKE MORE MONEY ESPECIALLY AS MIRIAM TOOK HER FIRST STEPS IN THEM 
BUT AS WE ALL KNOW AUCTIONS CAN BE UNPREDICTABLE 
WE REALLY NEED THE BIDDERS TO SHELL OUT FOR OUR REMAINING LOTS 
DON'T THEY KNOW THERE ARE VERY IMPORTANT MUSIC LESSONS AT STAKE 
UNFORTUNATELY THE HARLEQUIN RED PAINTED TEA SET DOESN'T DO WELL FOR US EITHER SELLING FOR ONLY TWENTY TWO 
THEN THERE'S ANOTHER BLOW 
WHEN THE FLAT PLATED CUTLERY SET SELLS FOR JUST EIGHTEEN 
WITH JUST FOUR LOTS REMAINING WE REALLY NEED THE HIGH BIDS 
IN ORDER TO REACH THE FIVE HUNDRED TARGET 
MAYBE OUR NEXT ITEM WILL BRIGHTEN UP THE PROCEEDINGS 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANYTHING BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY
