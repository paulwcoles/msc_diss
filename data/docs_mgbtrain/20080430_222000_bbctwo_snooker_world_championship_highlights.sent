THREE OF THE FOUR SEMI FINAL PLACES 
WERE FILLED TONIGHT OF THE LAST 
NAME WOULD BE INKED INTO THE SEMI 
FINAL LINE AT LINE UP THAT WOULD 
EITHER BE STEPHEN MAGUIRE HEARD JOE 
PERRY LAW JOE PERRY OR JOE 
PERRY MAGUIRE LEADS ELEVEN TO TEN HE 
NEEDS TO BECOME MORE FRAMES TO 
CROSS THE LINE MIKE TWO MORE 
FRAMES TO CROSS THE LINE 
COMMENTARY FROM NEAL FOULDS AND 
WILLIE THORNE 
RIGHT WHEN IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HE 
WAS GOING TO DO IT WE HAVE SEEN AL 
WIRE CLEAR UP WHEN HE HAS BEEN 
BEHIND STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
IT IS ANOTHER BREAK OF FIFTY WE HAVE 
SEEN ANY NUMBER OF THOSE KINDS OF 
BREAKS TODAY ARE WE GOING TO SEE 
IT AGAIN MAGUIRE IS LOOKING AT THE 
TWO REDS TOGETHER 
IS THIS GOING TO BE ANOTHER FRAME 
THAT STEPHEN MAGUIRE PINCHES JOE 
PERRY HAS ONLY HIMSELF TO BLAME IT 
HAS BEEN A VERY GOOD MATCH THE 
ONLY THING THAT HAS BEEN MISSING IS 
ONE FRAME VISIT VISITS 
HE HAS GIVEN HIMSELF A LITTLE BIT 
MORE ROOM WITH HIS BRIDGING HAND 
WHATEVER COLOUR MAGUIRE TAKES WITH 
THIS RED IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IN 
THAT HE WILL NEED THE PINK WHICH 
AS YOU CAN SEE IS TRICKY IT IS 
NOT BOW AS IT IS NOT AS THOUGH HE 
CAN JUST PLAY ON THE BLACK EVEN 
THOUGH THE PATTERN HAS BEEN THERE 
ALL DAY WITH FIFTY BREAKS NOT WINNING 
FRAMES FOR JOE PERRY IT IS NOT 
QUITE AT THAT STAGE YET THERE IS 
STILL WORK TO DO IT WOULD BE SOME 
CLEARANCE FROM HERE 
I'M NOT TOO 
SURE IF HE HAS GOT THE PERFECT 
ANGLE HERE THE BROWN IS WHERE HE 
WOULD LIKE THE CUE BALL TO FINISH 
HE HAS TO MAKE SURE YOU GET INSIDE 
THE BROWN LOOK AT THE KICK HE HAS 
GOT THEIR BARE MACRO THERE 
UNBELIEVABLE MAGUIRE HAS HAD TWO 
OF THE BIGGEST KICKS I HAVE EVER 
SEEN WHAT A REPRIEVE THAT IS FOR 
JOE PERRY 
IT WAS LIKE TWO LUMPS OF 
ROCK HITTING EACH OTHER L. DO 
NOTHING HE CAN STILL QUITE BELIEVE 
IT HE WAS GOING SO WELL A MASSIVE 
KICK 
GREEN TO BROWN WAS GOING TO BE 
TOUGH FOR MAGUIRE IT WAS JUST AS 
TOUGH FOR JOE PERRY 
THIS IS THE FIRST FRAME THAT JOE 
PERRY HAS PINCHED IT WILL HURT 
MAGUIRE BECAUSE IT LOOKED AS THOUGH 
HE WAS GOING TO GO AT TWELVE TO TEN IN 
FRONT 
THERE HAS BEEN A BREAK OF FIFTY AND 
ABOVE IN EVERY SINGLE FRAME WHAT 
AT TOPSY TURVY FRAME THAT WAS WE 
ARE ALL SQUARE AT ELEVEN EACH 
GREAT RESILIENCE FROM JOE PERRY 
WHO MADE THE QUARTER FINAL STAGE 
FOR MACRO YEARS AGO INTO THE NEXT 
WEEK GO AND MAGUIRE IS EIGHT POINTS 
BEHIND FOUR YEARS AGO 
A LITTLE BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE WITH 
THE RED IS SITTING OVER THE MIDDLE 
TO PLAY INTO THE PINK NO NEED TO 
PLAY IT HARD IF HE PLAYS IT AT CONTROLLED PACE 
HE DID NOT WANT TO RISK ANYTHING 
GOING WRONG HE MADE SURE TO AVOID 
IT WHAT A STRANGE MATCH THIS HAS 
BEEN 
STILL AMAZINGLY ENOUGH JOE PERRY 
HAS POTTED ONE HUNDRED TWO MORE BALLS THAN 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE IN THIS MATCH HE 
IS IN FRONT IN EVERY STATISTIC IN 
A FEW MOMENTS HE COULD BE BEHIND 
AGAIN 
IF THE GAME WAS ON AGGREGATE JOE 
PERRY WOULD BE WELL IN FRONT HE 
HAS THE BEST PART OF THREE HUNDRED MORE 
POINTS HE IS IN FRONT IN 
EVERYTHING 
THIS IS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY 
MAGUIRE IN HIS FIRST COUPLE OF 
MATCHES PREY PLAYED BRILLIANTLY 
AT THE END OF THE MATCHES HE HAD 
ALMOST ROUT OF STEAM IN THIS MATCH 
IT HAS BEEN THE OTHER WAY AROUND 
ALMOST RUN OUT OF STEAM HE HAS 
STARTED TO HIT THE BALL QUITE WELL 
MAGUIRE REACHED THE SEMI FINALS OF 
THIS GREAT CHAMPIONSHIP LAST YEAR 
LOSING NARROWLY TO JOHN HIGGINS IN 
A MATCH HE WAS VERY UNLUCKY NOT TO 
WIN AT ONE POINT AT CHANCE TO MAKE 
THE ONE TABLE SET UP ONCE AGAIN 
JUST PULLED UP IN TIME ANOTHER ANOTHER INCH OR SO FURTHER AND THIS WOULD 
HAVE BEEN AT TOUGH CUT BACK HE MAY 
STILL HAVE TO PLAY A CANNON ON THE 
REDS OF THE PINK OFF THE PINK 
LOOK WHERE THE CUE BALL HAS GONE A 
LOT OF DISTANCE NOW THIS IS THE 
POSSIBLE FRAME WINNING POT IF HE 
GETS THIS AND ANOTHER CHOIR YOU 
CAN SEE HIM GOING TWELVE TO ELEVEN IN FRONT 
ANOTHER COLOUR 
THAT IS WHY I THOUGHT HE WOULD PLAY 
A LITTLE CANNON ON THE BLACK TO 
LEAVE THAT RED AT DISTANCE AT THIS 
STAGE OF THE FRAME WAS ALWAYS GOING 
TO BE TRICKY HE HAS BEEN LITTLE 
FORTUNATE NOT TO HAVE LEFT 
STRAIGHTFORWARD POT ON HAVING 
MISSED THAT JOE PERRY WILL NOT BE 
WORRIED HE IS STILL IN THIS FRAME A BIG MISTAKE 
JOE IS COMING TO THE TABLE AND 
KNOWS HE NEEDS TO GET ONTO THE 
BLACK 
THIS IS TRICKY ESPECIALLY BLACK BECAUSE JOE IS CONSIDERING CLIMBING 
ON THE TABLE WITHOUT PLAYING IT HE 
HAS HAD ONE OR TWO MACRO TERRIFIC 
SHOT WITH THE REST L. WOULD NOT BE 
TOO WORRIED ABOUT USING IT IF I 
WERE HIM TWO TERRIFIC SHOT 
SHOTS 
GREAT SHOT GREAT SHOT HE HAS GOT 
TO BE A LITTLE CAREFUL SURPRISED 
HE PLAYED IT THAT HARD IT SHOULD 
BE O. K. 
JUST AWKWARD CUEING HE DID NOT 
WANT TO GO OVER THE TOP OF THAT RED 
BUT HE HAD NO CHOICE ARE WE GOING 
TO SEE A REAL TURNROUND WE HAVE 
SEEN AND THE NUMBER OF FRAMES WHERE 
JOE PERRY HAS MADE FIFTY OR MORE AND 
HE HAS GONE ON TO LOSE THIS WOULD 
BE A BIG TURNAROUND HE HAS A LOT 
TO DO 
IF HE GETS THREE HIGH VALUE CONNORS 
MACRO HE WILL NOT NEED THE PINK 
HIGH VALUE CONNORS MACRO 
IF HE GETS THREE HIGH VALUE 
COLOURS HE WILL NOT NEED THE PINK 
JOE HAS JUST HAD A LOOK AT THE 
SCORES HE SHOULD NOW BE AWARE OF 
THAT HIGH CHORUS HIGH COORS 
NORMALLY YOU WOULD SEE A PLAYER 
JUST ROLL THIS IN AND GET ON THE 
RED TO PLAY ON THE BLUE L. DO NOT 
THINK HE WANTS TO DO THAT HE HAS 
GOT THE ANGLE HE HAS TO PLAY ON 
THE BLACK WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR 
NOT 
THIS CAME OFF A BIT QUICK OFF NOT THE CUSHION THIS PUTS THE POINTS 
ALL SQUARE HE NEEDS AN ANGLE HE 
IS BLESSED WITH DECENT CUE POWER 
JOE BUT NOT AS GOOD AS SOME OF THE 
PLAYERS YOU HAVE GOT TO GET PAST 
THE BLUE YOU REALLY HAVE GOT TO 
GET PAST THE BLUE OTHERWISE THIS IS 
IT DIFFICULT YELLOW CAN YOU 
BELIEVE IT HE CAN POT IT BUT 
WITHOUT THE KISS ON THE BLUE IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THIS IS 
TRICKY 
THE PLOT THICKENS THE ONE POINT 
LEAD JOE PERRY HAD WAS ACTUALLY 
SIGNIFICANT BELIEVE IT OR NOT HE 
ONLY NEEDED UP TO THE BLUE IT IS 
ONE OF THE FEW SHOTS IN THIS MATCH 
THAT HE HAS MISSED WITH THE REST 
VERY CONSISTENT IN THAT DEPARTMENT 
THE REASON IT IS SIGNIFICANT IS 
THAT HE WILL BE HURTING HE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN THIRTEEN IN FRONT ON THE PINK 
IF HE HAD GOT BROWN AND BLUE THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT SHOT 
THE TWISTS AND TURNS IN THIS MATCH 
UNBELIEVABLE BROWN AND BLUE TO BE 
IN FRONT TO BE THIRTEEN IN FRONT IT 
ALL DEPENDS WHAT ANGLE HE GETS ON 
THIS BLUE 
HE HAS ALMOST PLAYED ON THE BLUE AS 
IF IT WAS ON ITS SPOT HE HAS GONE 
A FRACTION TOO HARD BUT THIS IS A 
SHOT HE WANTS TO SEE GO IN THIRTEEN WILL 
BE THE DIFFERENCE IF HE CAN ROLL 
THIS BLUE IN THAT IS HIS PRIORITY 
HE CANNOT DO ANYTHING ELSE EITHER 
HE CANNOT PLAY ANY KIND OF SHOT TO 
GET ON THE PINK AT ALL MAKE SURE 
OF IT 
WHAT DO YOU DO HERE YOU'RE THIRTEEN IN 
FRONT THE SAFETY IS ONLY EASY IF 
YOU CAN HIT IT WITHOUT GETTING A 
DOUBLE KISS HE HAS PLAYED THE PINK 
IN BEHIND THE BLACK HE HAS PLAYED 
IT VERY WELL THAT IS A GOOD SHOT 
WHAT ABOUT THAT FOR A SHOT 
ABSOLUTE CLASS 
TERRIFIC SHOT 
HE MAYBE IT HAVE TO 
HOLD THE WHITE AT THIS END HE 
MAY BE ABLE TO THE DOUBLE IS NOT 
ON HE HAS GOT A GOOD WHITE THIS 
IS NOT EASY TO GET SAFE 
HE HAS NOT PLAYED THIS VERY WELL 
THE PRIORITY HAD TO BE TO GET THE 
PINK LONG WAY AWAY FROM THE 
POCKET THIS IS NOT EASY BUT IT IS 
A GOOD CHANCE AND HE HAS TO PLAY 
IT 
THAT WAS VERY VERY WELL STRUCK 
INDEED HE PUTS HIS CUE DOWN JOE 
PERRY IS DISAPPOINTED IT IS 
FRAME TO STEPHEN MAGUIRE HE LEADS 
BY TWELVE TO ELEVEN JUST ONE MORE 
NEEDED FOR A PLACE IN THE SEMI 
FINALS MAGUIRE WAS A SEMI FINALIST 
HERE LAST YEAR WHEN HE LOST TO JOHN 
HIGGINS HE HAS BEEN STRAINING AT 
THE LEASH TO GET BACK EVER SINCE 
CANNY CROSS THE LINE INTO THE NEXT 
WE GO AND IT IS MAGUIRE LEADING 
CAN HE CROSSED THE LINE 
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT COULD GO 
WELL IN THAT SHORT AS RAIDS ALL 
OVER THE PLACE ONE ALL THE POCKET 
ONE IN OPEN PLAY NOT A SHOT 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE WILL WANT TO SEE 
AGAIN A MILE OF THE FROM THE POOR 
A MILE AWAY FROM THE POT 
ARE WE GOING TO GET ANOTHER LAST 
FRAME FIGHT OUT HERE AT THE 
CRUCIBLE WHEN THE OF WORK TO DIS 
IT FOR THIS CAN BE CONSIDERED TO BE 
A FRAME WINNING OPPORTUNITY 
PLENTY OF WORK TO DO IT YEAR 
YET 
HE CAN PLAY FOR PINK OR BLACK HE 
IS NOT ON EITHER NICELY HE CAN 
REACH IT WITHOUT THE EXTENSION 
WOULD NOT FANCY HIM KNOCKING THIS 
BLACK IN WITHOUT THE REST 
IT MUST BE TOUCH AND GO WHETHER HE 
IS ON THIS 
WITH THE COUPLE OF AWKWARD REDS 
THERE IS QUITE A GOOD LEAD THAT HE 
CAN BUILD UP HERE THE FRAME WILL 
NOT BE ONE BUT IT WILL HELP HIM 
WITH THE TWO REDS BEEN SAFE IT IS 
PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE OF 
VISITS TO CLEAR UP 
HE COULD PLAY THE PINK INTO THE 
CENTRE IF HE WANTS PROBABLY THE 
BEST SHOT REALLY 
I LIKE THAT THOUGHT SOME PLAYERS 
DO NOT LIKE PLAYING REDS INTO REDS 
BUT THERE IS SO MUCH MILEAGE AND 
THE SHOT 
IT COULD GO WRONG HE COULD DOUBLE 
KISS IT BUT THERE IS PLENTY OF 
VOLUME IN TRYING TO KNOCK ONE OF 
THESE REDS MORE INTO PLAY VALUE 
I SUPPOSE THAT IS THE DOWNSIDE 
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF A GAP ROUND 
THE BACK OF THE TWO REDS 
MAYBE HE HAD TO MAKE HIS MIND UP 
WHICH RED HE WAS GOING TO HIT 
RATHER THAN PLAY INTO THAT GENERAL 
AREA WHICH I THINK HE MAY HAVE 
DONE 
MAGUIRE PLAYING A LITTLE SWEAR ON 
TO THE REDS SO NOW SWERVE 
SHE A GOOD FORTUNE HE HAD NO IDEA 
ABOUT THIS AT ALL 
BECAUSE HE IS A FEW N. T. S. BEHIND 
THAT IS WHY HE'S BRINGING THE PINK 
BACK INTO PLAY 
WITH EITHER OF THESE THIN SAFETY 
SHOTS HE HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL OF 
THE DOUBLE KISS 
BECAUSE HE HAS PLAYED CUSHION FIRST 
HE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MUCH OF AN 
IDEA WHERE THE CUE BALL WAS GOING 
TO END UP HOW DOES HE GET SAFE 
FROM THAT LEFT HAND RED 
I THINK HE IS PLAYING FULL BALL TO 
LEAVE THE WHITE ON THE BACK CUSHION 
AND HE FLIPPED THE OTHER RED THAT 
IS THE REASON WHY IT IS NOT ON THE 
CUSHION 
THERE COULD BE A HALF CUSHION CHANCE HERE STEPHEN WILL BE 
INTERESTED IN THIS RED TO TOP RATE 
RIGHT THIS COULD BE A BIG SHOT 
NOW YOU SEE THE SHOT HE IS LEFT 
WITH 
IT IS NOT THERE NOT EVEN CLOSE 
AND HE HAS LEFT THE RED 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR QUITE 
SOME TIME BUT I HAVE SEEN STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE MISS A FEW PRESSURE SHORTS 
SHOTS 
THERE'S ADRENALIN FOR YOU HE 
OVERHIT THAT BY THREE FEET 
HE DID NOT MEAN THE KISS ON THE 
GREEN AS LAWYER PURRS AS IT IS 
FULL BALL ON THE WAY BACK 
NEEDS A RED AND A SIZEABLE COLOUR 
FOR TWELVE TO TWELVE 
IT IS MISSABLE IT IS 
NOT EXACTLY RIGHT OVER THE POCKET 
AND THE GREEN IS HAMPERING HIS 
CUEING THAT IS A GOOD SHOT MADE 
IT LOOK EASY 
THE SPECTATORS HAVE REALISED THAT 
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE HEADING FOR A 
DECIDER HERE 
HE IS LOOKING OUT THE SCORE BOARD 
TWENTY NINE OF A DIFFERENCE ONE SNOOKER 
BARRING A SNOOKER IT WILL BE TWELVE TO TWELVE 
AND IT WAS WE HAVE THE FIRST FINAL 
FRAME DECIDER OF THESE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
IS THIRTY TWO POINTS ADRIFT 
HE COULD PLAY HALF BALL OFF THESE 
REDS AND GETTING BEHIND THE BROWN 
THAT IS ON ITS WAY BUT IT IS NOT 
HARD ENOUGH NOW JOE COULD PLAY 
THE SAFETY SHOT WHICH WOULD PUSH 
THE RED DOWN THE TABLE SO HE 
RETAINS THE ADVANTAGE AS WELL AS 
HIS LEAD THE RED CAME ALONG WAY UP THE TABLE 
IT IS NOT EASY TO GET BACK INTO 
BALL BAULK WITH THE BROWN BEING 
OFF ITS SPOT THERE IS PROBABLY ONLY 
THE YELLOW THAT HE CAN GET IN 
BEHIND 
HE HAS OVERHIT THIS HE NEEDS A 
KISS AND HE HASN'T GOT ONE THIS THIS SHOT IS NOT NICE BECAUSE HE CANNOT 
PLAY ALL AROUND THE TABLE HE HAS 
GOT TO PLAY FOR THE PINK OR MAYBE 
THE BLUE HE KNOWS THAT IF HE 
MISSES HE WILL DO THEIR DAMAGE 
THIS IS A PRECIOUS SHOT PRESSURE 
SHORT SHOT THAT WAS NOT AS EASY 
AS IT APPEARED HE COULD LOSE THE 
MATCH FROM THIS 
THE PRESSURE ON THIS GAME IS 
UNBELIEVABLE 
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY ONE HE WILL 
REMEMBER HE MISSED THE CANNON ON 
THE PACK AND 
THAT IS 
THE ONE THAT 
WILL GIVE HIM NIGHTMARES IF HE ON TO LOSE THIS FRAME AND MATCH 
HE MOVED ON THAT A LITTLE BIT OF 
MOVEMENT BEFORE HE PLAYED THE SHOT 
IT IS ALL ABOUT THE PRESSURE L. 
CANNOT BLAME HIM FOR THAT HE 
BASHED THE TABLE IN FRUSTRATION 
HE DID AT LEAST HAVE HIS CHANCE IN 
THIS FRAME AND HE MAY NOT GET 
ANOTHER BECAUSE OF WHERE THE BALLS 
ARE 
JOE PERRY HAS GOT A CHANCE TO ARE GET TO THE SEMI FINAL OF THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP FOR THE VERY FIRST 
TIME HE WILL NOT GET A BETTER 
CHANCE 
IF HE MISSES THE BLACK HE IS O. K. 
HE GOT VERY CLOSE TO THE BLACK HIS 
HEART MUST HAVE SKIPPED A BEAT 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE PLAYED UNBELIEVABLE 
SNOOKER IN THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS HE 
MAY HAVE BURNED HIMSELF OUT A 
LITTLE BIT HE HAD SPELLS IN THIS 
MATCH WHERE HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS 
GOING TO PLAY WELL BUT LOOKING AT 
ALL TWENTY FIVE FRAMES JOE PERRY HAS 
CERTAINLY BEEN THE AGGRESSOR ON 
REFLECTION HE JUST ABOUT DESERVES 
TO WIN ABSOLUTELY PERFECT MATCH BALL COMING UP 
THIS MATCH IS AS GOOD AS OVER 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE STARTED HIS 
CAMPAIGN TREMENDOUSLY WELL HE 
CANNOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS RESULT 
HE HAS PLAYED EXTREMELY WELL 
TONIGHT JOE PERRY 
THEY'RE THE ORIGINAL CELEBRATION 
VERY ORIGINAL THERE IS A 
JOE PERRY 
BLOWING A 
KISS 
TO 
HIS ARMY 
OF FANS WHO HAVE COME 
UP FROM CAMBRIDGE IT IS LOVELY 
WHEN YOU ARE WALKING ROUND THE 
TABLE KNOWING YOU 
HAVE WON 
THE 
MATCH PROBABLY 
THE BIGGEST MATCH 
OF 
HIS CAREER 
TO 
GET TO 
THE SEMI 
FINAL AT THE CRUCIBLE IS HEGE HE 
SHOULD HUGE IT HAS BEEN A GOOD 
STANDARD THIS EVENING WITH A LOT OF 
BREAKS OF FIFTY AND ABOVE A LOT OF 
FRAMES COULD HAVE GONE EITHER WAY 
HE STARTED WITH A BREAK OF THIRTY THREE AND 
WHEN HE MISSED THE CANNON FROM BLUE 
TO READ I THOUGHT HE MAY HAVE 
MISSED THE BOAT STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
HAD TWO GOOD CHANCES IN THIS FRAME 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PRESSURE WAS 
TOO MUCH ON THE DAY HE IS A GREAT 
PLAYER 
IT WAS A GREAT MATCH DESERVE TO GO 
TWELVE TO TWELFTH THE CRUDE HAVE STAYED ON 
UNTIL LATE IN THE EVENING JOE 
PERRY KEPT HIS BOTTLE AND HE WINS 
BEATING STEPHEN MAGUIRE THIRTEEN TO TWELVE 
THE AT THIS HERE IN THE CRUCIBLE 
TONIGHT WAS SOMETHING I HAVE NOT 
WITNESSED BEFORE ATMOSPHERE L. 
ENJOYED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
DISAPPOINTED HAD I LOST BUT I 
ENJOYED THAT MATCH 
IT WASN'T AND 
TUCK ALL THE WAY A COUPLE OF TIMES 
I LOOKED 
AS IF 
I IT WAS GOING TO 
POOLE AWAY BUT HE JUST KEPT COMING 
BACK IT DESERVED TO BE TWELVE THRILL 
OVER THAT TWO DAYS JOE PROBABLY 
PLAYED THE BETTER SNOOKER 
WE HAVE 
BECOME QUITE GOOD FRIENDS OVER THE 
COURSE OF THE SEASON WHATEVER 
HAPPENS WERE WAS WILL BE IN THE
