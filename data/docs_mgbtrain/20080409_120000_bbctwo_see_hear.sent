IT CAN AFFECT OUR HEALTH AS WELL AS OUR HEARING 
BUT IF YOU'RE TOO LOUD 
THE AUTHORITIES CAN TAKE DRASTIC ACTION AGAINST YOU 
WE INVESTIGATE HOW FAR NOISE IS HARMING ALL OF OUR LIVES 
TEN O'CLOCK ON A SATURDAY NIGHT 
AND NEWHAM'S NOISE INSPECTORS ARE OUT PATROLLING THE STREETS 
THEIR JOB IS TO CRACK DOWN ON NOISE NUISANCE 
JULIA COOK IS THE TEAM LEADER 
HELLO THERE HAVE YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH NOISE 
COMING FROM A COUPLE OF DOORS AWAY 
IN TEN YEARS WITH THE TEAM 
VINNIE WHYTE HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH MANY TRICKY SITUATIONS 
MOST PEOPLE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE QUITE REASONABLE 
WHEN THEY UNDERSTAND YOU'RE JUST DOING YOUR JOB 
AND THAT THE MUSIC IS LOUD IT IS GETTING LATE 
THEY'RE GENERALLY O. K. 
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT REACTION YOU'RE GOING TO GET 
SOME PEOPLE TAKE GREAT OFFENCE TO US KNOCKING ON THEIR DOOR 
THEY'VE HAD A COMPLAINT ABOUT A HOUSE PARTY 
FIRST THEY CALL ON THE NEIGHBOURS 
I THINK IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM 
JUST GET AN IDEA OF HOW FREQUENT THIS PROBLEM IS 
AND WHAT TIME THIS MIGHT GO ON TILL 
HELLO HELLO HELLO THERE 
IT'S THEM THEM NEXT DOOR OBVIOUSLY YEAH O. K. 
CAN WE JUST COME IN AND HAVE A LISTEN INSIDE YEAH 
HOW LONG HAVE THESE PEOPLE LIVED HERE 
WELL I THINK THREE MONTHS NOT LONG 
AND HAS IT ALWAYS BEEN A MUSIC PROBLEM 
ON A WEEKEND ONLY ON ONLY ON THE WEEKEND O. K. 
YOU HEAR IT MORE IN THE BEDROOM UP THERE THAN YOU HEAR IT DOWN HERE 
O. K. WE'LL SPEAK TO THEM AND ASK THEM TO CLOSE THE WINDOWS 
LOWER THE VOLUME DOWN 
YOU SEE THE WINDOW IS WIDE OPEN SOMETIMES YOU COULD HEAR EEEE 
YEAH WE COULD HEAR IT IF IT'S A PROBLEM AFTER WE GO CALL US 
WE WON'T DISTURB YOU BUT WE WILL GO AND SPEAK TO THEM 
THE PARTY IS IN A HOUSE 
RENTED BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM EASTERN EUROPE 
HERE WE GO JULIA 
HELLO IS IT YOUR HOUSE YES 
O. K. WE'RE FROM THE COUNCIL 
IT'S A BIRTHDAY I KNOW BUT IT'S 
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD NOISE FROM THIS PROPERTY THOUGH 
IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IT'S TOO LOUD 
YOU'VE GOT TO TURN THE NOISE DOWN NOW IT'S TOO LOUD 
YEAH IT'S THE SINGING THE VOICES YOU NEED TO TURN IT DOWN 
IF YOU CONTINUE WITH THE NOISE NO IT'S O. K. 
WE WILL TAKE YOU TO COURT NO 
AND IT'S A FINE OF UP TO FIVE THOUSAND FOR NOISE NUISANCE 
WE'LL ALSO TAKE YOUR STEREO AWAY AS WELL SO IT'S UP TO YOU 
NO THIS IS FIRST TIME IT'S MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY 
DO YOU THINK IT'S REASONABLE THAT PEOPLE COMPLAIN NO 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEBODY MIGHT COMPLAIN YEAH OF COURSE 
BUT JUST ONE TIME YOU HAVE THIRTY YEARS OLD IT'S A BIRTHDAY 
COS IT'S BEKA'S BIRTHDAY BEKA'S THIRTY IT'S MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY PARTY 
IT'S HIS THIRTIETH BIRTHDAY YES YES YES 
I CAN SEE BOTH POINTS OF VIEW 
IT'S JUST YOU CAN'T KEEP BOTH SIDES HAPPY 
YOU'VE GOT TO TRY AND GET SOME REDUCTION IN THE NOISE 
DO YOU THINK IT REALLY WAS A THIRTIETH BIRTHDAY PARTY 
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE PEOPLE ON WHAT THEY SAY TO YOU 
IF WE'RE BACK NEXT WEEK AND THERE'S ANOTHER PARTY I WON'T BELIEVE THEM 
A RECENT STUDY FOR THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL 
SUGGESTS THAT SOCIAL NOISE LEVELS HAVE TRIPLED OVER A TWENTY YEAR PERIOD 
DOMESTIC NOISE IS THE MOST COMMON PROBLEM 
AND COMPLAINTS ROSE BY OVER FIVE HUNDRED PER CENT BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
BUT FAR FROM FINDING NOISE A PROBLEM 
SOME PEOPLE LOVE TO IMMERSE THEMSELVES IN IT 
WOW UP A GEAR 
NICE GEAR CHANGE MURRAY I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THAT ONE 
FOR OVER FORTY YEARS MURRAY WALKER HAS BEEN THE VOICE OF MOTOR RACING 
HE'S BEEN SEDUCED BY THE ACTION AND BY THE SOUND 
YA HOO YES 
THE NOISE OF A FORMULA ONE ENGINE GOING FLAT OUT 
AND TURNING OVER AT NINETEEN THOUSAND REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE 
IS SOMETHING LIKE YOU NEVER HEAR ANYWHERE ELSE 
AND IT GETS RIGHT INTO YOUR BONE MARROW 
BUT ONE DAY HE FOUND THAT HE'D GOT A PROBLEM WITH HIS HEARING 
THE TIME I REALISED I HAD GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
IS WHEN MY WIFE FOR ABOUT THE THOUSANDTH TIME SAID 
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE TURN THE TELEVISION VOLUME DOWN 
YOU'RE NEARLY BLOWING ME OUT OF THE ROOM 
HE'S EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT HEARING LOSS 
AND TODAY HE HAS TO WEAR HEARING AIDS IN BOTH EARS 
AND HE'S GOT SOME CAUTIOUS WORDS OF ADVICE 
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO NOISE 
DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT YOUR HEARING 
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T YOU WILL SUFFER IN LATER LIFE 
AND YOU MAY WELL WISH THAT YOU HAD BEEN MORE SENSIBLE IN YOUR YOUTH 
HE'S GOT A POINT 
RECENT RESEARCH FOR THE ROYAL NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR THE DEAF 
SUGGESTS THAT NINETY PER CENT OF PEOPLE AGED EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY 
SUFFER SOME SIGNS OF DAMAGE TO THEIR HEARING AFTER A NIGHT OUT 
YET DO NOTHING TO PREVENT IT 
IT'S NOT JUST NIGHTS OUT 
NOISY TECHNOLOGY LIKE M. P. THREE PLAYERS 
IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES 
THERE GOES THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SHERYL CROW 
BEN BUTLER IS A MUSICIAN AND WEB MANAGER FROM SOUTH LONDON 
I DROPPED ACID ON A SATURDAY NIGHT 
JUST TO SEE WHAT THE FUSS WAS ABOUT 
I LOVE MY IPOD VERY MUCH 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE HANDY THINGS 
THAT YOU JUST COULDN'T IMAGINE LIVING WITHOUT 
IT'S JUST SOMETHING I ALWAYS HAVE WITH ME 
WHEN I LEAVE THE HOUSE IT'S KEYS WALLET IPOD 
APPLE HAVE NOW SOLD OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION IPODS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 
WHEN THE IPOD FIRST CAME OUT 
I WAS ONE OF THOSE EARLY ADOPTERS THAT HAD TO HAVE ONE 
AND BECAUSE I WAS SO OBSESSED WITH IT IN THE EARLY DAYS 
MY WIFE GOT THE UNFAIR NICKNAME OF THE IPOD WIDOW 
BUT SHE'S DEFINITELY NOT AS RESENTFUL AS SHE USED TO BE 
BECAUSE I'VE MANAGED TO FIND A NICE BALANCE 
BETWEEN MY WIFE AND MY IPOD TIME 
WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT IN ANY MARRIAGE REALLY 
SO COULD BEN'S USE OF THE IPOD BE AFFECTING HIS HEARING 
WE TOOK HIM TO MET BRADFORD BACKUS 
A RESEARCH FELLOW AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE EAR INSTITUTE 
FOR AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT 
HI YOU MUST BE BEN YES 
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT THANKS 
SO YOU'RE A MUSICIAN YES 
AND I UNDERSTAND YOU USE YOUR IPOD QUITE A LOT YES O. K. 
JUST GIVE ME AN IDEA IF YOU WOULD 
JUST SORT OF A RUNNING COMMENTARY ON THAT 
WELL EVERY DAY PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR HOURS OF IPOD USAGE 
WOW YEAH THAT'S A LOT OF ALL RIGHT 
I TEND TO DO IT AT MY DESK 
SO CAN AN M. P. THREE PLAYER BE DAMAGING 
ALL RIGHT BEN WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS AN ARTIFICIAL EAR 
IT'S ATTACHED TO A DB S. P. L. METER 
AND WE'LL SEE HOW LOUD THE MUSIC IS THAT YOU'RE LISTENING TO 
I'LL JUST PUT THE IPOD EARPHONE INTO OUR FAKE EAR 
RIGHT IT'S COMING OUT AT ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHT DECIBELS 
THAT SOUNDS HIGH 
IT'S HIGH BUT IT'S NOT OVERWHELMINGLY HIGH GOOD 
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE DURATION THAT HE LISTENS TO 
HE IS QUITE A HEAVY USER SO EVEN IF HE LISTENS AT RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS 
IF WE SEE SOMETHING LIKE EIGHTY EIGHT D. B. 
YOU KNOW AT FOUR HOURS THAT IS ALREADY BEYOND 
WHAT THE REGULATIONS SPECIFY 
AS A LEVEL THAT YOU NEED HEARING PROTECTION 
IT'S DEFINITELY GOT ME THINKING ABOUT IT MORE 
I'M QUITE CONFIDENT 
THAT HOPEFULLY I'VE BEEN RESPONSIBLE OVER THE YEARS 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M SURE THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME EFFECT 
BUT FINGERS CROSSED NOTHING TOO SERIOUS 
OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS BEN WILL KEEP A DIARY OF HIS IPOD USAGE 
WE'LL FIND OUT LATER WHETHER OR NOT HIS HEARING IS BEING AFFECTED 
HELLO IT'S THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH NOISE TEAM 
WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO YOU NOW I RANG YOU EARLIER 
THE TEAM HAS TO DEAL WITH A COMPLAINT ABOUT A ROWDY FAMILY 
HELLO SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU WE'RE FROM THE COUNCIL 
WE'RE FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH NOISE TEAM YEAH 
AND WE'RE GETTING COMPLAINTS ABOUT MUSIC 
WHO'S MADE A COMPLAINT THEY PLAY THEIR MUSIC ALL THE TIME 
IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT YOUR MUSIC YEAH 
BLOODY RADIO OVER THERE MUM MUM GO 
CAN YOU KEEP YOUR NOISE DOWN 
BECAUSE THE SOUND INSULATION IS NOT GREAT IN THESE PROPERTIES 
I KNOW THEY'RE RUBBISH YOUR SPEAKERS ARE ON THIS SIDE 
AND IT'S THE BASS WHAT TRAVELS 
IF YOU CAN JUST KEEP THE NOISE DOWN THE VOICES AND THE MUSIC 
IF YOU JUST KEEP THAT DOWN ALL RIGHT ONE SEC ONE SEC 
BECAUSE IT'S GETTING LATE O. K. 
LISTEN LOOK SEE THAT THAT MEANS I'M NOT ALLOWED OUT PAST SEVEN FIFTEEN YEAH 
I'M NOT EXTENDING THE MUSIC TOO LOUD BUT I'M JUST KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
YEAH JUST KEEP IT LOW THINK OF THE VOLUME AND THE BASS TRAVELLING 
DO YOU THINK IT'S REASONABLE THAT THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT NOISE 
WELL IF I'M BREAKING THE LAW I WILL STOP PUTTING MY MUSIC ON 
BUT AS LONG AS I'M IN THE LAW BOUNDS I'LL CARRY ON PLAYING MY MUSIC 
BUT THIS MIGHT BE A QUESTION LESS OF THE LAW 
AND MORE OF JUST BEING SORT OF ANTI SOCIAL 
IT'S NOT LISTEN THIS WOMAN KNOCKS ON MY DOOR EVERY NIGHT YEAH 
TELLING ME TO TURN MY MUSIC DOWN 
SHE KNOCKS ON MY DOOR AT SEVEN O'CLOCK ON CHRISTMAS EVE 
SHE CAN GO AWAY 
B. B. C. BIG IT UP LIKE HAPPY NEW YEAR AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT LIKE BIG IT UP 
LIKE WE'D HAD ENOUGH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR 
THERE'S A FAMILY THERE OF MIXED AGES 
YOU'VE GOT THE PARENTS OR A PARENT THERE 
PLUS SOME YOUNG CHILDREN THERE 
DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY WHETHER THEY'RE ALL FROM THE SAME FAMILY 
AND YOU'VE GOT A YOUNG GUY THERE 
THAT QUITE OPENLY SHOWED US HIS TAG ON HIS LEG 
SO YOU'VE ALREADY GOT A POTENTIAL PROBLEM FAMILY THERE 
BEFORE YOU EVEN START 
AND WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO BE RESPECTFUL 
OF THE NOISE THEY'RE CAUSING REMAINS TO BE SEEN 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST NEIGHBOURS WITH LOUD MUSIC 
THAT GIVE US PROBLEMS 
IN TODAY'S WORLD WE'RE SURROUNDED BY NOISE 
PROFESSOR DEEPAK PRASHER HAS BEEN RESEARCHING THE EFFECT 
OF LONG TERM NOISE ON HEALTH 
HE ARGUES THAT THE DECIBEL LEVELS 
EVEN IN AN EVERYDAY ENVIRONMENT LIKE A RESTAURANT COULD BE HARMFUL 
WE'RE GETTING READINGS BETWEEN SEVENTY TWO AND EIGHTY TWO 
WHICH IS QUITE HIGH REALLY 
IT'S NOT THE PLACE THAT YOU WANT TO BE FOR A LONG TIME 
AND A BUSY STREET COULD BE WORSE 
THE READINGS ARE RANGING FROM ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE TO NINETY TWO 
THESE ARE PRETTY HARMFUL 
IF YOU WERE IN A WORK PLACE YOU'D HAVE TO WEAR EAR PROTECTION 
ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE IS BECOMING A BIGGER AND BIGGER PROBLEM 
IN THE WORLD WITH ALL THE MEGA CITIES IN THE WORLD 
THE INCREASING TRAFFIC CREATING THE NOISE 
INCREASING NUMBERS OF AIRCRAFTS TAKING OFF AND LANDING 
THE SHEER NUMBERS IN THOSE BIGGER CITIES IS CREATING A HUGE PROBLEM 
THOSE INCREASING LEVELS OF NOISE CAN BE A NUISANCE FOR EVERYBODY 
AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING 
THEY CAN MAKE LIFE SURPRISINGLY DIFFICULT 
ANDREW GOODWIN IS PROFOUNDLY DEAF 
AND ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE AFFECTS HIM BADLY 
A WALK ON THE SEASHORE IS O. K. 
BUT OTHER ROUTINE SITUATIONS ARE MORE TRICKY 
A TRIP TO THE LOCAL MARKET WITH ALL THE NOISES OF THE STREET 
CAN BE A NIGHTMARE 
BECAUSE I DEPEND ON LIPREADING 
ANY SORT OF SOUND THAT I HAVE HELPS WITH MY LIPREADING 
AND IF THERE'S LOTS OF DISTRACTIONS LOTS OF LOUD NOISES 
LIKE PEOPLE WALKING AROUND ESPECIALLY ALL THIS TRAFFIC 
IT'S MUCH HARDER TO CONCENTRATE AND WITH LIPREADING 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF CONCENTRATION TO MAKE IT WORK 
WHEN WE ASK HIM TO PICK UP A FEW BASIC GROCERIES 
IT PROVES TO BE A BIT OF A STRUGGLE 
HIS POCKET FULL OF CHANGE 
ILLUSTRATES THE DIFFICULTIES OF A ROUTINE SHOPPING TRIP 
QUITE A BIT OF CHANGE ACTUALLY TODAY THAT MUCH 
MAINLY BECAUSE OF ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE 
I KIND OF GUESS AT HOW MUCH THINGS ACTUALLY ARE 
SO RATHER THAN GIVE EXACT CHANGE 
I HAVE TO ALWAYS GIVE JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH 
IF IT'S LIKE SEVENTY P. OR WHATEVER I'LL GIVE A POUND AND GET CHANGE 
OR IT'LL BE A FIVER OR A TEN POUND IT'LL ALWAYS BE A BIT TOO MUCH 
SOMETIMES IT'S JUST SO FRUSTRATING 
HAVING TO ASK PEOPLE TO REPEAT THINGS 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S LOTS OF DISTRACTIONS 
AND ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE 
SO IT'S EASIER JUST TO GIVE A BIT MORE MONEY AND GET THE CHANGE 
BACK IN SOUTH LONDON OUR IPOD ADDICT BEN BUTLER 
IS STILL LISTENING TO AS MUCH MUSIC AS EVER 
NOW HE'S GOING BACK TO SEE BRAD BACKUS AT THE EAR INSTITUTE 
OH HI BEN NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN HI GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
SO YOU'VE BEEN OFF AND KEEPING A TRACK OF YOUR HEARING 
YES ABSOLUTELY HOPE YOU'RE NOT TOO SHOCKED 
RIGHT WELL I CAN SEE HERE 
THAT SOMETHING LIKE TWO TWO AND A HALF HOURS A DAY 
THE TOTAL IS TWENTY FOUR HOURS OVER A WEEK 
BEN NOW TAKES THE HEARING TEST 
HE HAS TO PRESS THE BUTTON WHENEVER HE HEARS A BEEP 
OFF YOU GO 
INTERMITTENT 
ALL RIGHT BEN WHAT I'M SHOWING HERE IS THE RESULTS OF YOUR AUDIOGRAM 
YOU HAVE THE LEFT EAR ON THIS PANEL AND THE RIGHT EAR ON THIS PANEL 
AT THIS POINT IT'S UNCLEAR 
WHETHER YOU'VE ACTUALLY HAD ANY DAMAGE ALREADY OR NOT 
FROM THIS TEST 
BUT THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THERE COULD BE SOMETHING STARTING 
AND SO IT'S A GOOD TIME FOR YOU 
TO THINK ABOUT PROTECTING YOUR EARS MAYBE NOT USING THE IPOD SO MUCH 
I THINK I'LL DEFINITELY HAVE TO LOOK AT MY IPOD CONSUMPTION 
AND THE AMOUNT I USE IT 
WILL OBVIOUSLY INVOLVE SOME KIND OF LIFESTYLE CHANGES 
IN THE SENSE THAT PERHAPS IT SHOULDN'T BE THE NATURAL REACTION 
WHEN I GET ON A TRAIN TO PUT MY IPOD ON 
OR MAYBE AT WORK I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE RADIO 
THAT EVERYONE ELSE LISTENS TO 
AND NOT LISTEN TO MY HEADPHONES SO MUCH 
ALTHOUGH THE USAGE AND VOLUME OF ANY M. P. THREE PLAYER IS UP TO THE LISTENER 
APPLE HAVE RECENTLY INTRODUCED NEW TECHNOLOGY 
TO PREVENT PEOPLE TURNING THEIR IPODS UP TOO LOUD 
BUT AT STREET LEVEL NOT EVERYONE IS SO CAREFUL WITH NOISE 
THAT'S WHY COUNCILS NOW HAVE POWERS TO TAKE AGGRESSIVE ACTION 
AS A LAST RESORT 
THEY CAN NOW REMOVE STEREO SYSTEMS FROM TROUBLE MAKERS 
RIGHT THIS IS OUR STORE ROOM 
WHERE WE KEEP ALL OUR EQUIPMENT THAT WE'VE SEIZED FROM PEOPLE 
THIS PARTICULAR PILE OVER HERE WAS SEIZED FROM A BASEMENT FLAT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT MUSIC ONLY HAPPENS LATE AT NIGHT 
TWO THREE IN THE MORNING 
THIS IS ACTUALLY A GUY PLAYING MUSIC AT EIGHT NINE IN THE MORNING 
HE HAS HAD SEVERAL WARNINGS 
AND WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO IN AND SEIZE THAT EQUIPMENT 
THIS IS QUITE AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF EQUIPMENT 
THAT WE TOOK FROM A COMMERCIAL PREMISES 
THIS WAS A RESTAURANT LICENSED AS A RESTAURANT 
BUT OPERATING AS A MINI NIGHTCLUB 
THERE WAS NO SOUND INSULATION AND THE NOISE WAS HORRENDOUS 
WE ALSO HAD NOISE FROM FOOTBALL BEING PLAYED VERY LOUDLY 
THROUGH THE TELEVISION IN THE BAR AREA 
WE WILL TAKE ALL OF THE MUSIC AS WELL 
AND VINYL IF IT STILL EXISTS AND C. D.'S 
THIS REALLY HURTS THEM BECAUSE THEIR WHOLE COLLECTION IS TAKEN AWAY 
TODAY THERE WILL BE A NEW ADDITION TO THE STORE ROOM 
BECAUSE THE TEAM ARE ABOUT TO CALL ON A PERSISTENT OFFENDER 
IN THE EAST HAM AREA 
IT'S TIME FOR DRASTIC ACTION 
LONDON BOROUGH OF NEWHAM SERVED A NOISE NOTICE 
THE GUY'S JUST CONSTANTLY BREACHING THE NOTICE 
HE'S JUST CARRYING ON PLAYING IT 
EVERY WEEKEND HE'S PLAYING LOUD MUSIC 
TILL THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING 
BASICALLY THE NEIGHBOURS HAVE HAD ENOUGH 
SO WE'VE VISITED HIM WE'VE SENT HIM LETTERS GAVE HIM WARNINGS 
SO THERE'S NO OTHER OPTION FOR THE COUNCIL 
BUT TO TAKE DRASTIC STEPS TO TAKE HIS HI FI AWAY 
THEY NEED THE POLICE WITH THEM JUST IN CASE THINGS TURN NASTY 
WE'LL GIVE HIM A BASH ON THE DOOR NOW 
THEY'LL GET A SURPRISE NOW WON'T THEY 
THERE'S NO REPLY SO THE TEAM HAVE A LOCKSMITH ON HAND 
NOW WE'LL FORCE ENTRY 
WE'LL REPLACE THE LOCKS 
AND WE'LL LEAVE THEM AT THE LOCAL POLICE STATION 
O. K. WE'RE IN 
POLICE POLICE 
O. K. THERE'S THE OFFENDING STEREO 
SO WE'LL JUST TRY AND BE IN AND OUT AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN 
O. K. SIX MILLION ONE HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO 
THERE'S STILL NO SIGN OF THE HOUSEHOLDER 
BUT THE POLICE KEEP WATCH JUST IN CASE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK HIS REACTION WILL BE WHEN HE COMES BACK 
I'D IMAGINE HE'LL BE FUMING HE'LL BE FUMING 
HE'S THEN GOT TO PROBABLY GET HOME FROM WORK 
THEN HE'LL HAVE A NOTE ON HIS DOOR 
TELLING HIM THE KEYS ARE AT THE POLICE STATION 
AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE NO MUSIC TONIGHT 
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY BUT HIS NEIGHBOURS ARE 
THE NOTICE TAPED ON HIS DOOR CONTAINS ONE OTHER NASTY SURPRISE 
A BILL FOR THREE HUNDRED 
TO COVER THE COST OF DRILLING OUT AND REPLACING THE LOCKS 
A FEW WEEKS LATER WE MEET UP WITH THE HOUSEHOLDER 
A MAN NAMED JOEL CAMPBELL 
HE STILL HAS ALL THE WARNING NOTICES THE COUNCIL SENT HIM 
ALL I SEE HERE IS A LOAD OF RUBBISH 
I'M BEING HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT IT 
IT DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT EVERY DAY THERE'S NOISE COMING FROM MY HOUSE 
HE'S STILL UPSET ABOUT THE DAY HE CAME HOME 
TO FIND HIS STEREO HAD BEEN TAKEN 
I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THEM KIND OF THING HAPPEN 
AND TO SEE THAT THE LAW ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN 
WHERE IS THE JUSTICE THERE 
BECAUSE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE THE POWER TO COME IN 
AND TAKE SOMETHING WHAT BELONGS TO THE PERSON 
WHILE THE PERSON ISN'T THERE ABSENT IS NOT JUSTICE THERE 
BECAUSE THE WAY I LOOK AT IT THAT'S INVADING HIS PRIVACY 
AND TO ME THAT'S BURGLARY 
THE COUNCIL SAY THAT IT'S A SERIOUS OFFENCE 
TO DISRUPT OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES WITH NOISE 
IT DEPENDS TO WHAT EXTENT IF IT'S ON A REGULAR BASIS 
WELL THEY SAID IT WAS ON A REGULAR BASIS 
IT WASN'T ON A REGULAR BASIS THEY'D SAY ANYTHING TO COVER THEIR ARSE 
WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW THEN WILL YOU BUY A NEW SYSTEM 
I'VE NO INTENTION OF BUYING A NEW SYSTEM 
EVEN THOUGH SOMEONE GIVE IT TO ME I WOULDN'T ACCEPT IT 
I WOULD GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE BECAUSE THE WAY I LOOK AT IT 
I'M HAPPY THE WAY I AM 
ANY TIME I WANT TO LISTEN TO MUSIC I'LL GO OUT 
BUT I SUPPOSE THAT MEANS THAT NEWHAM COUNCIL'S HARD LINE POLICY 
OF TAKING YOUR STEREO HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE THEY'VE WON 
NO THEY AIN'T WON 
BECAUSE MUSIC'S IN MY HEAD ALL THE TIME 
I DON'T NEED TO HAVE MATERIAL STUFF IN MY YARD TO PUT MUSIC IN MY HEAD 
I WAS BORN WITH MUSIC IN MY HEAD 
BUT JOEL STILL HAS TO PAY THE THREE HUNDRED BILL 
FOR HAVING HIS OWN FRONT DOOR LOCK DRILLED OUT 
I'VE NO INTENTION OF PAYING IT 
THEY COULD TAKE ME TO COURT IF THEY WANT AND PUT ME IN PRISON 
I'VE NO INTENTION SO THEY'D BETTER GET READY TO PUT ME IN PRISON 
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY PUT ME IN PRISON FOR SIX MONTHS 
THEY DON'T MEAN NOTHING 
I'M STILL GONNA COME OUT AND HAVE A JOB TO GO TO 
CONFISCATING SOMEONE'S STEREO MAY BE EXTREME 
BUT SOME EXPERTS ARGUE THAT IT'S ACCEPTABLE 
BECAUSE NOISE DAMAGES MUCH MORE THAN YOUR HEARING 
PROFESSOR DEEPAK PRASHER'S RESEARCH 
SUGGESTS NOISE CAN HAVE MUCH WIDER HEALTH CONSEQUENCES 
EVEN THE DECIBEL LEVELS ON A RAILWAY STATION 
THAT SORT OF NOISE LEVEL YOU SHOULDN'T BE LISTENING TO 
SO HOW FAR DID IT GO UP THEN WHEN WE HEARD THAT TRAIN 
THAT WENT UP TO ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE 
ANYTHING ABOVE SIXTY FOR LONG TERM IS GOING TO CAUSE PROBLEMS 
HE SAYS CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO NOISE CREATES STRESS 
WHICH CAUSES HARMFUL CHANGES TO OUR CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM 
MOST OF US THINK THAT IF WE LIVE LONG ENOUGH IN A NOISY ENVIRONMENT 
OUR BODIES ADAPT TO IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T 
THE HORMONAL CHANGES THAT HAPPEN 
AS A RESULT OF CONTINUOUS EXPOSURE TO NOISE CONTINUE TO HAPPEN 
THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES GO ON AND THEY'RE DETRIMENTAL TO US 
WITHOUT US REALISING THAT THEY ARE BEING DETRIMENTAL 
THAT'S SOMETHING IRENE JONES WOULD CERTAINLY RECOGNISE 
SHE MOVED OUT TO THE ESSEX COUNTRYSIDE THIRTY YEARS AGO 
WITH VISIONS OF A PEACEFUL LIFE REARING CHICKENS 
BUT IT HASN'T QUITE WORKED OUT LIKE THAT 
NEARBY STANSTED AIRPORT BEGAN TO EXPAND 
AND NOW IT TAKES OVER TWENTY MILLION PASSENGERS A YEAR 
IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO LIVE 
AND BEING IN THE COUNTRY YOU GET LOTS OF NICE COUNTRY NOISES 
THE BIRDS SINGING EVEN THE WIND AND THE RAIN CAN BE ENJOYABLE SOMETIMES 
BUT WE DO GET AN AWFUL LOT OF INTERRUPTIONS 
IT CAN BE VERY UNPLEASANT 
I PERSONALLY DON'T GET USED TO IT PEOPLE SAY YOU'LL GET USED TO IT 
BUT I HAVE NEVER GOT USED TO IT 
I'M AWARE OF EVERY PLANE THAT GOES OVER BECAUSE IT'S SO INTRUSIVE 
SHE'S TRIED TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT 
BUT THE CONSTANT NOISE HAS CAUSED HER SERIOUS MEDICAL PROBLEMS 
I WENT TO MY DOCTOR AND SAID I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THIS 
AND SHE ACTUALLY SAID I THINK YOU'RE CLINICALLY DEPRESSED 
AND RECOMMENDED THAT I TOOK SOME MEDICATION FOR IT WHICH I DID DO 
SO IS THERE ANY WAY OF CALCULATING THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE 
THAT NOISE IS DOING TO OUR HEALTH 
WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO NOISE 
THEN THIS LEADS US TO STRESS 
DEEPAK PRASHER AND HIS COLLEAGUES BELIEVE THEY CAN PUT A FIGURE 
ON HOW FAR IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DEATHS EVERY YEAR IN THE U. K. 
FROM CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE 
THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF NOISE EXPOSURE 
AND THE RISK OF GETTING HEART DISEASE 
AND THIS RISK INCREASES AS THE NOISE EXPOSURE INCREASES 
AND IF YOU TAKE THAT 
AND TRY TO ATTRIBUTE HOW MUCH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE 
OVERALL IS AFFECTED BY NOISE 
THEN YOU COME UP WITH A FIGURE OF AROUND ONE PER CENT ONE TWO PER CENT 
THAT WOULD SUGGEST EXPOSURE TO NOISY ENVIRONMENTS 
COULD BE CAUSING THE EQUIVALENT OF BETWEEN TWO FOUR THOUSAND DEATHS EVERY YEAR 
BACK IN NEWHAM THE FIGHT AGAINST NOISE GOES ON 
TODAY THERE'S ONE LAST JOB TO DO 
MAYOR OF NEWHAM SIR ROBIN WALES AND COUNCILLOR IAN CORBETT 
ARE INVITED ALONG TO DO THE HONOURS 
YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT WE THINK IT IS 
THAT NOISE IS DEALT WITH PROPERLY AND THE ONLY ANSWER 
IF PEOPLE PLAY THESE SORT OF THINGS LATE AT NIGHT 
AND MAKE OTHERS' LIVES A MISERY WE'VE GOT TO KEEP TAKING THIS STUFF 
UNTIL PEOPLE LEARN THAT AT NIGHT OTHER PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO SLEEP 
THIS IS THE FATE OF ALL THE EQUIPMENT 
THAT THE TEAM HAVE SEIZED IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS 
THIS MAY BE ONE VICTORY BUT IS THE FIGHT 
AGAINST HARMFUL ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE ONE THAT WE CAN EVER WIN 
WE HAVE VERY VERY FEW QUIET PLACES 
WE'RE SURROUNDED BY NOISE 
WHEN WE WAKE UP IN THE HOME IT'S NOISY 
ALL THE GADGETS ELECTRONIC GADGETS ARE NOISY 
CHILDREN ARE USING IPODS PERSONAL MUSIC PLAYERS 
IN TERMS OF LEISURE NOISE IT'S INCREASING 
IN TERMS OF IMPACT ON YOUNG PEOPLE IT'S INCREASING 
THE VOLUME OF TRAFFIC IS INCREASING 
WE'RE BUILDING MORE ROADS WHICH INCREASES THE TRAFFIC EVEN FURTHER 
SO NOISE IS LIKELY TO BE MORE AND MORE OF A NUISANCE 
IN EVERYONE'S LIVES 
BUT PERHAPS THAT MIGHT BE GOOD NEWS FOR SOME PEOPLE 
IF I WAS HAVING MY LIFE AGAIN 
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE IS A HEARING AID MANUFACTURER 
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN FUTURE YEARS
