BABY I KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT TROUBLE IN THE FIELDS 
WHEN THE BANKERS SWARM LIKE LOCUSTS OUT THERE TURNING AWAY OUR YIELD 
OUR DREAMS ROLL BY OUR SILOS SILVER IN THE RAIN 
THEY LEAVE OUR POCKETS FULL OF NOTHING 
AND OUR DREAMS AND THE GOLDEN GRAIN 
HAVE YOU SEEN THE FOLKS IN LINE DOWNTOWN AT THE STATION 
THEY'RE ALL BUYING THEIR TICKETS OUT 
AND TALKING THE GREAT DEPRESSION 
OUR PARENTS HAD THEIR HARD TIMES FIFTY YEARS AGO 
WHEN THEY STOOD OUT IN THESE EMPTY FIELDS IN DUST AS DEEP AS SNOW 
AND ALL THIS TROUBLE IN OUR FIELDS 
IF THIS RAIN CAN FALL THESE WOUNDS CAN HEAL 
THEY'LL NEVER TAKE OUR NATIVE SOIL 
AND IF WE SELL THAT NEW JOHN DEERE 
THEN WE'LL WORK THESE FARM WITH SWEAT AND TEARS 
YOU'LL BE THE MULE I'LL BE THE PLOUGH 
COME HARVEST TIME WE'LL WORK IT OUT 
THERE'S STILL A LOTTA LOVE 
HERE IN THESE TROUBLED FIELDS 
THERE'S A BOOK UP ON THE SHELF ABOUT THE DUST BOWL DAYS 
AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF YOU AND A LITTLE BIT OF ME 
IN THE PHOTOS ON EVERY PAGE 
NOW OUR CHILDREN LIVE IN THE CITY AND THEY REST UPON OUR SHOULDERS 
THEY NEVER WANT THE RAIN TO FALL OR THE WEATHER TO GET COLDER 
AND ALL THIS TROUBLE IN OUR FIELDS 
IF THIS RAIN CAN FALL THESE WOUNDS CAN HEAL 
THEY'LL NEVER TAKE OUR NATIVE SOIL OH OH 
AND IF WE SELL THAT NEW JOHN DEERE 
THEN WE'LL WORK THESE FARM WITH SWEAT AND TEARS 
YOU'LL BE THE MULE I'LL BE THE PLOUGH 
COME HARVEST TIME WE'LL WORK IT OUT 
THERE'S STILL A LOTTA LOVE 
HERE IN THESE TROUBLED FIELDS 
YOU'LL BE THE MULE I'LL BE THE PLOUGH 
COME HARVEST TIME WE'LL WORK IT OUT 
THERE'S STILL A LOTTA LOVE 
HERE IN THESE TROUBLED FIELDS 
THANK YOU 
CAN I END YET NO NO NOT YET 
GENTLE RHYTHMIC ACOUSTIC GUITAR 
I'M IN A NEW PLACE NOW 
THEY DON'T KNOW ME NEXT DOOR 
BUT I CAN HEAR THEIR FOOTSTEPS FALL 
EVERY NIGHT AROUND THIS TIME 
DOES HE TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS 
BE DJANGO PLAYING 
AS THEY WALTZ ACROSS THE FLOOR 
AND THE LONELIEST SOUND OF ALL 
IS THE SOUND OF LOVE 
THROUGH A STRANGER'S WALL 
AND WHEN THEIR LAUGHTER FADES 
AND THERE ARE NO MORE WORDS 
THE SILENCE BREAKS ME MOST OF ALL 
AND THE LONELIEST SOUND OF ALL 
IS THE SOUND OF LOVE 
THROUGH A STRANGER'S WALL 
AND WHEN THEIR LAUGHTER FADES 
AND THERE ARE NO MORE WORDS 
THE SILENCE BREAKS ME MOST OF ALL 
AND THE LONELIEST SOUND OF ALL 
IS THE SOUND OF LOVE 
THROUGH A STRANGER'S WALL 
AND THE LONELIEST SOUND OF ALL 
IS THE SOUND OF LOVE 
THROUGH A STRANGER'S WALL 
I'M IN A NEW PLACE NOW 
THEY DON'T KNOW ME NEXT DOOR 
I WONDER WHERE YOUR FOOTSTEPS FALL 
I WONDER WHERE YOUR FOOTSTEPS FALL 
I WONDER WHERE YOUR FOOTSTEPS FALL
