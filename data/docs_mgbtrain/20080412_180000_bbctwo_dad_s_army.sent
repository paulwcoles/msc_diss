NO I DON'T AGREE 
IT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE A CHANGE 
ALTHOUGH SERGEANT WILSON HAS THREE STRIPES ON HIS HONOURABLE ARM 
YOU'VE GOT THREE PIPS ON YOUR COMMON SHOULDER 
SO ALTHOUGH YOU'RE MORE COMMON THAN HE IS YOU'VE GOT BETTER INSIGNIA 
AND THAT IS THE STATUS QUO 
EXCUSE ME MY LORD 
CAN THE VICAR HAVE AN AUDIENCE WHAT'S GOING ON 
I WONDERED IF THE HONOURABLE ARTHUR WOULD JOIN THE CHURCH COUNCIL 
AND WOULD HE APPROVE A CREST FOR HIS OWN PRIVATE PEW I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A PARADE

TAKE OVER CORPORAL WILSON COME WITH ME I DON'T TRUST YOU I'LL DEAL WITH YOU LATER
