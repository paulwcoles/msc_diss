YOU'RE BUYING A CLOCK IT'S NOT BRAIN SURGERY IS IT 
HOW WAS CLAIRE THEN SHE WAS O. K. 
ON THE BED THROW THE PRICE WAS COMING DOWN AND FOR SOME REASON 
THEY STOOD UP MAYBE DOING A BIT OF ROLE PLAY AND CLAIRE SAID TO QUOTE 
I'M TIRED MY FEET ARE SORE I WANT TO BUY IT HERE 
I THOUGHT WE WERE LIKE BOYFRIEND GIRLFRIEND THERE ARE THREE FUNDAMENTAL ERRORS HERE 
THERE'S THAT ONE A REAL BIGGIE 
AND THEN WE GET ONTO THE TWO ITEMS THAT WE GOT FINED FOR 
THE FIRST ONE WAS THE AKO TAJINE DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID WRONG THERE 
IT'S A READING ISSUE RIGHT 
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU CAN BUY THOSE IN MARRAKESH 
BUT WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR A BRANDED ITEM 
AND YOU BOUGHT SOME POPPY PIECE OF TUT REALLY 
YOU DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT THE LIST WHEN YOU WERE BUYING THE TAJINE POTS ALEX THAT WAS YOU WASN'T IT 
I DON'T BELIEVE I WAS SOLELY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT 
WE ALL WENT TO DIFFERENT SHOPS I DIDN'T SAY THAT'S IT 
THERE WERE GUCCI BRANDED UNDERPANTS WHEREVER YOU LOOKED 
YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY THINK THEY WERE GENUINE DO YOU 
RIGHT O. K. 
AND THEN WE'VE GOT THE KOSHER CHICKEN 
JENNY YOU ARE A LADY OF THE WORLD 
SLIGHTLY OLDER THAN THE REST OF THE PEOPLE HERE 
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY TODAY SIR ALAN I'M THIRTY SIX TODAY 
CONGRATULATIONS 
AT THIRTY SIX YEARS OLD 
ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THE TERMINOLOGY KOSHER 
AND YOU DON'T KNOW THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH JEWISH PEOPLE 
NO SIR ALAN 
I'M FLABBERGASTED TO BE QUITE HONEST 
MICHAEL IN YOUR C. V. WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU WROTE ON IT 
WHAT DID YOU SAY IN THERE YOU'RE A GOOD JEWISH BOY IS THAT RIGHT YEAH 
O. K. YEAH WELL YOU ARE OR NOT I'M A NICE JEWISH BOY YEAH 
O. K. COS IF YOU'RE UNSURE YOU CAN ALWAYS PULL YOUR TROUSERS DOWN WE CAN CHECK 
IS IT RIGHT THAT YOU WENT TO A MUSLIM HALAL BUTCHER 
AND ASKED HIM TO GET YOU A KOSHER CHICKEN 
AND HE ACTUALLY MADE A PRAYER OVER IT IS THAT RIGHT 
THAT'S CORRECT SIR ALAN 
AND HE SLAUGHTERED IT FOR YOU THAT'S CORRECT 
ARE YOU HAVING A LAUGH OR WHAT I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T GO THE WHOLE HOG 
AND FIND A ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST TO TAKE THE BUTCHER TO CONFESSION 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE INTELLIGENT PEOPLE 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
AREN'T YOU EMBARRASSED MICHAEL 
I AM EMBARRASSED YEAH DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD LAIHIAN MEANS 
I KNOW WHAT THE WORD SCHMUCK MEANS BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT LAIHIAN MEANS NO 
YOU DON'T I'M ONLY HALF JEWISH SIR ALAN SO WHY DID YOU SAY 
YOU'RE A GOOD JEWISH BOY TO IMPRESS ME FOR ME TO SYMPATHISE WITH YOU 
TREAT YOU A BIT DIFFERENTLY NO I'M NOT THAT WAY INCLINED 
WHY DID YOU PUT IT THERE YOU EITHER ARE OR YOU AREN'T I'M HALF JEWISH 
O. K. 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
I THINK THIS TEAM IS TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL 
IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THE MISTAKES IN BUYING THE PRODUCTS 
THAT I CAN JUST POINT AT OR I CAN POINT AT THE TEAM LEADER 
BE UNDER NO ILLUSION THERE'S NO WRITTEN RULE 
THAT SAYS I DON'T HAVE TO JUST GET RID OF ONE PERSON HERE 
THERE'S THREE TERRIBLE MISTAKES I DON'T GIVE A SHIT 
I'LL FIRE THREE OF YOU IF I HAVE TO TODAY I'LL FIRE THE WHOLE BLOODY FIVE OF YOU 
DON'T BOTHER ME AT ALL IT'S UP TO YOU 
YOU OPEN YOUR BLOODY MOUTH OR I JUST MAKE SOME QUICK DECISIONS NOW SIR ALAN CAN I SPEAK UP THEN 
LET ME JUST SAY I'LL BE THE FIRST TO PUT MY HANDS UP IF I'VE MADE A MISTAKE IN BUSINESS 
CAN WE FIND ANOTHER EXPRESSION ABOUT PUTTING YOUR HANDS UP 
I MADE A MISTAKE IN BARTERING FOR THE POTTERY 
AND THE BEDSPREAD ALSO I'M GOING TO COME ONTO THAT YEAH 
ON THE BEDSPREAD I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IF CLAIRE HADN'T INTERRUPTED ME SO IT'S HER FAULT THEN 
ALEXANDER SIXTY QUID IS DOWN TO HER IS IT 
I AGREE IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT 
VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP CLAIRE QUIET THROUGH A NEGOTIATION 
DO YOU HOLD HER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SIXTY QUID LOSS 
I DO HOLD HER RESPONSIBLE ABSOLUTELY O. K. 
I'M STOOD WE'RE DOING A BOYFRIEND GIRLFRIEND ROLE PLAY 
WHEN WE WENT TO THE PLACE THAT SOLD THE BEDSPREADS YOU SAID 
I'M GOING TO SIT HERE AND STAY QUIET AND THEN I WAS HALFWAY THROUGH IT 
YOU COULDN'T HELP IT NO I DON'T THINK IT WAS MY FAULT 
DID YOU STAND UP DURING MY NEGOTIATIONS I DID THAT'S A PROBLEM DID YOU INTERFERE 
IN THEIR NEGOTIATIONS I THOUGHT THAT WAS AGREED 
SORRY I THOUGHT IT WAS AGREED I'VE GOT A PICTURE THERE WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY VERY QUICKLY 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE QUICKLY JUST MAKE IT CONCISE AND PRECISE BUT YOU CAN SAY AS MUCH AS YOU WANT 
RIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT IN TERMS OF SALES AND NEGOTIATING 
WHICH HASN'T I THINK BEEN LOOKED UPON I DID A PRETTY DAMN GOOD JOB 
IN THAT TASK APART FROM THE CHICKEN APART FROM THE CHICKEN FIASCO 
I NEGOTIATED ONE OF THE BEST DEALS IF NOT THE BEST DEAL OF THE DAY 
ON WHAT ON THE COW HIDE WHICH I GOT DOWN FROM TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR 
SORRY WEREN'T WE WORKING AS A TEAM AND WASN'T THAT MY NEGOTIATION 
I THINK WE BOTH CONTRIBUTED TOWARDS THAT 
FIFTY ONE EQUIVALENT APPROXIMATELY O. K. AND THEN FROM THE CACTUS 
JUST AS A MATTER OF INTEREST THE FIRST TEAM GOT IT FOR FIFTEEN 
O. K. THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF I GOING ON THERE AND 
ESSENTIALLY I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE CHICKEN ARTICLE SIR ALAN 
I WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT WHEN THE GUY NODDED HIS HEAD AND WE SAID KOSHER 
THAT HE UNDERSTOOD US BECAUSE AT THIS POINT I FELT I NEEDED TO DOUBLE CHECK 
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY MICHAEL THAT TOLD ME THAT EVERYTHING WAS ABSOLUTELY FINE 
AND WITH HIS JEWISH ROOTS I FELT THAT HE WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE LIE 
THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE LIE HOW COULD YOU SIT THERE LIKE THAT AND LIE MEANING OF THE WORD KOSHER 
WHEN DID YOU KNOW ABOUT HIS JEWISH CONNECTIONS I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT HE'S FROM A JEWISH BACKGROUND 
A FEW MOMENTS AGO YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT KOSHER WAS ASSOCIATED WITH JEWISH DID YOU NO I DIDN'T 
SO NOW YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT YOU STILL DIDN'T KNOW IT IN THE BOARDROOM TILL I RAISED THE ISSUE 
AND NOW YOU TELL ME THAT YOU DID KNOW WHAT IT WAS 
BUT YOU WERE RELYING ON HIS JEWISH CONNECTION DON'T SOUND RIGHT TO ME SOMEHOW 
I SAID TO YOU FIVE MINUTES BEFORE WE WENT THERE THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND 
THE FULL MEANING BEHIND KOSHER AND YOU SAID TO ME 
THAT YOU HAD A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THAT WORD 
IS THAT NOT TRUE I SAID IS THAT NOT TRUE 
NO I DIDN'T SAY THAT MICHAEL 
YOU'RE A LIAR I SAID I BELIEVED IT TO BE WHEN YOU CUT A CHICKEN'S NECK AND LET THE BLOOD DRAIN OUT OF IT 
AS I WAS CONFUSED BETWEEN KOSHER AND HALAL SO YOU KNOW ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS NO 
A MOMENT AGO YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING NOW YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT CHICKENS 
IT'S LIKE HEADLESS CHICKENS I'VE GOT HERE 
WHO'S IDEA WAS IT TO PERSUADE THE TENNIS RACKET SHOP 
NOT TO STRING ALPHA'S TENNIS RACKETS 
THAT WAS MY IDEA MARGARET 
AND YOU TRIED TO BRIBE THEM I THINK DID YOU 
WE DID TAKE SOME MONEY OUT AND ASKED THEM 
IF THEY WOULD NOT STRING THE OTHER TENNIS RACKETS 
AS WE THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO WIN 
BIT OF A CHEAP SHOT WASN'T IT 
IT WAS A CHEAP TRICK IN HINDSIGHT AND WE THOUGHT IT MAY GAIN US AN ADVANTAGE 
HMM DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
NORMALLY I WOULD ASK THE TEAM LEADER TO BRING THREE PEOPLE IN 
I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO GET OUTSIDE AND SIT AND REFLECT 
SO GET OUT 
AT THE START I THOUGHT SHE WAS A REAL CONTENDER 
WOULD GO ALL THE WAY SHE WAS BRIGHT ARTICULATE 
BUT AS TIME HAS GONE ON I THINK THERE'S A SORT OF A. 
ELEMENT OF DISHONESTY ABOUT HER AND THIS TENNIS RACQUET THING 
THAT'S A DIRTY CHEAP LITTLE SABOTAGE TRICK ISN'T IT 
THIS IS ALL NEW TO ME I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU TWO HAD DONE THE RACQUET 
AND YOU STAYED QUIET ALL DAY KNOWING THAT I'D BEEN WORRIED ON THE PLANE BACK 
THE THING ABOUT THESE TASKS IS TO FIND OUT WHAT WE ARE REALLY LIKE 
AND I'VE BEEN QUITE SHOCKED 
I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT FOR THE TEAM TO CHEAT MICHAEL 
SHE CLAIMED NOT TO KNOW ABOUT KOSHER THEN SHE BECOMES A BLOODY AUTHORITY ON IT 
AND THEN TURNS ON PEOPLE WHEN SHE REALISES SHE'S UNDER PRESSURE 
YOU MAY BE GLORY HUNTING AND YOU MAY BE FIGHTING FOR YOUR CHANCE TO STAY IN THE COMPETITION 
BUT I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD BE HONEST ABOUT THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE 
RIGHT SEND THE FIVE OF THEM IN PLEASE FRANCIS YES SIR ALAN 
HAVE YOU GOT A CLEAR VISION IN YOUR MINDS AS TO WHY YOU THINK YOU SHOULD STAY HERE 
YES YEAH WHO WANTS TO SPEAK FIRST 
WHEN MICHAEL AND I WENT OUT AND BEGAN NEGOTIATING 
IT WORKED BRILLIANTLY ON THE FIRST PARTICULAR NEGOTIATION 
IT WENT TO POT IN THE SECOND NEGOTIATION WHAT THE CHICKEN ONE YES IT DID SIR ALAN 
THIS WAS THE ONE THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 
WHEN MICHAEL WAS TELLING ME TO ASK FOR HALAL MEAT 
AND THAT WE SHOULD BE SAYING THANK YOU TO ALLAH I THOUGHT THAT 
THANK YOU TO WHO TO ALLAH 
WHAT FOR A KOSHER CHICKEN YES I THOUGHT THAT HE MUST HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING 
AS HE WAS SO PASSIONATE ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT 
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HANG ON EVERY WORD THAT I SAY AND THEN TURN IT ON YOUR COLLEAGUES 
YOU HAVE CHANGED YOUR STORY ON THE KOSHER ARGUMENT 
AND THEN TRIED TO PLACE THE BLAME ON YOUR TEAM MATE WHO YOU WERE RUNNING AROUND WITH 
SORRY SAME OLD STORY 
JENNY YOU'RE FIRED GOODBYE 
RIGHT WHO'S NEXT 
I'M ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED THAT I'VE BEEN THE ONE THAT'S GOT FIRED 
AND MICHAEL WHO BEHAVED INAPPROPRIATELY 
WAS BENDING THE RULES THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE TASK 
AND THEN SAT UP IN THE BOARDROOM AND LIED IS THE ONE HAS GOT TO STAY 
I'M ABSOLUTELY AMAZED 
WITH THIS TASK I SAID OPENLY WHAT MY MISTAKES WERE 
I DID MY BEST TO RECTIFY THEM AND I DID YOU WERE OUT OF CONTROL 
YOU CAN'T READ YOU CAN'T GET GREEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A KOSHER CHICKEN IS 
I CAN ACTUALLY READ AND WELL YOU CAN'T I GAVE YOU A DOSSIER 
YOU CAN'T READ YOU DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO DETAIL 
I DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL BUT I NEVER GIVE UP 
I CAN GUARANTEE I WILL NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN 
I'LL GUARANTEE YOU WON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN 
IN MAYBE NOT GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO STAY HERE 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY I JUST WANTED TO SAY 
THAT I MADE A HORRIFIC MISTAKE WITH THIS WHOLE KOSHER BUSINESS 
DO YOU KNOW MICHAEL YOU SEEM TO HAVE ADOPTED A KIND OF 
I'M GOING TO COME IN HERE AND I'M GOING TO ADMIT ALL MY MISTAKES 
NO I JUST DON'T LIKE TO MAYBE YOU ARE ONE BIG MISTAKE NO 
THERE'S THINGS I'VE DONE HERE THAT HAVE BEEN BRILLIANT I'M NOT FLASH ABOUT IT 
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN TO SAY OVER TO YOU I WENT OUT 
I GAVE IT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT YOU WERE VERY GOOD IN THE FIRST TASK EVEN THOUGH YOU LOST 
I LIKED THE WAY YOU SPOKE UP FOR YOURSELF I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS 
SIR ALAN I'M NOT SUBDUED I'M FULL OF BEANS 
I'M MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT DOING THIS THAN ANYTHING IN MY LIFE 
SO WHO SHOULD BE FIRED THEN MY OPINION YEAH BE BOLD 
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD INTERRUPT A NEGOTIATION CLAIRE INTERRUPTED MINE SO I WOULD FIRE HER 
CLAIRE SPEAK UP I THINK JEN SHOULD BE FIRED AS THERE WERE TOO MANY MISTAKES 
SHE BOUGHT TWO ITEMS WHICH WERE WRONG SHE HAD THE LIST OF ITEMS AND DIDN'T CHECK IT 
THERE HAS TO BE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE PROJECT MANAGER 
SIR ALAN IF YOU GO OUT WITH CLAIRE ON A TASK EVER IN YOUR LIFE IT'S LIKE WORKING WITH A TASMANIAN DEVIL 
SHE IS SO UNCONTROLLABLE CLAIRE WAS A FANTASTIC PROJECT MANAGER WHEN SHE LOOKED AFTER ME 
IN MY OPINION JEN SHOULD BE FIRED 
YOU DIDN'T WORK WITH HER FOR THE WHOLE DAY MICHAEL 
CAN I GIVE AN EXAMPLE WHERE I DISAGREE YOU SAID I WANT TO TAKE THE ITEMS BACK 
WHICH COULD TAKE AN HOUR THEN I'LL GO WITH THE RUG AND I SAID CAN YOU DO THE RUG FIRST 
AND THEN DO THE ITEMS AND YOU WENT OOH 
NO I DIDN'T GO OOH WELL YOU DID 
NO I DIDN'T I'M NOT TRYING TO UNDERMINE YOU 
RIGHT BUT YOU BOUGHT TWO THINGS WHICH WERE WRONG HERE'S MY NEXT MOVE 
ALEXANDER 
GO BACK TO THE HOUSE 
I'LL SEE YOU ON THE NEXT TASK ALL RIGHT THANKS SIR ALAN 
YOU THREE GO OUTSIDE I'M GOING TO CHAT WITH NICK AND MARGARET 
AND THEN YOU'LL COME BACK IN AND ONE OF YOU IS GOING TO GET FIRED 
SHE WAS COMPLETELY DISORGANISED FROM THE START TOTALLY DISORGANISED 
AND JUST TALKS TALKS TALKS LIKE A BLOODY RATTLING MACHINE GUN 
CLAIRE DID KEEP INTERRUPTING 
I CAN SEE THAT SHE WAS IRRITATING 
BUT I THINK THAT SHE WAS DOING WELL HMM 
MICHAEL HE'S A WASTE OF SPACE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED 
HOW CAN ANYBODY I'M A CATHOLIC YOU'RE A PROTESTANT WE KNOW WHAT KOSHER IS AND HE DOESN'T 
HE DID CLASSICS AT EDINBURGH HE'S A BRIGHT BOY HOW COULD HE MAKE SUCH A MESS OF IT 
I THINK EDINBURGH ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE 
CLEARLY 
FRANCIS SEND THEM IN PLEASE YES SIR ALAN 
THIS TASK WAS RUN BY YOU JENNIFER 
I BELIEVE YOU LOST CONTROL OF IT QUITE FRANKLY 
BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT 
TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHY I SHOULD LET YOU CARRY ON IN THIS PROCESS 
I MAY HAVE LOST CONTROL I DO BELIEVE I HAD SOMEBODY WHO WAS MAYBE NOT INTENTIONALLY OR WHATEVER 
BUT WAS QUITE DESTRUCTIVE ON MY SUB TEAM I DIDN'T STRESS I DIDN'T LOSE THE PLOTOUT 
WHEN I MADE MISTAKES I RECTIFIED IT AS QUICKLY AS I POSSIBLY COULD 
I DON'T EVEN THINK YOU KNEW YOU MAKE MISTAKES 
IT WAS OTHER PEOPLE THAT TOLD YOU YOU'D MADE MISTAKES NO 
I'VE WORKED WITH CLAIRE AND I FELT THAT SHE TRIES TO UNDERMINE THE PROJECT MANAGER 
SHE SPEAKS OVER THEM AND TRIES TO TAKE CONTROL 
SHE MIGHT SEE THINGS GOING WRONG SIR ALAN I'M SAT HERE AND I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED 
BECAUSE I WISH JEN HAD SPOKEN TO ME EARLY ON AND SAID HOW SHE WAS FEELING 
BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS I'VE GOT A VERY THICK SKIN 
I MIGHT NOT BE AS ARTICULATE AS OTHER PEOPLE 
AND BE ABLE TO TALK THE TALK AND PLAY THE GAME YOU DON'T DO BAD LOVE 
I'VE TAKEN ON THE FEEDBACK THAT YOU'VE GOT ONE OF THESE AND TWO OF THESE AND I AM TRYING TO CHANGE 
AND THERE'S A LOT OF GAME PLAYING THERE'S A LOT OF BULLSHIT AND I'M SICK OF IT 
I CAME HERE TO DO BUSINESS TO BECOME BETTER AND TO MAKE MONEY FOR YOU AND ME 
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY 
THANK GOD FOR THAT 
I FOUND OUT SOMETHING THAT REALLY SHOCKED ME 
THE FACT THAT YOURSELF AND JENNY TRIED TO BRIBE 
THAT WAS JENNY ACTUALLY YOU WERE THERE MICHAEL 
DO YOU CONDONE THE BRIBING OF THE MAN TO DE STRING THE RACQUET 
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT I DIDN'T BACK IT UP BUT JENNY INSTIGATED THE BRIBING 
IT WAS CONDEMNABLE REPREHENSIBLE BUT YOU WERE THERE AND DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME ABOUT IT 
I THINK IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO WORK IN YOUR COMPANY 
YOU WANT SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT GOING TO CHEAT AND LIE TO GET AHEAD IN A COMPETITION 
AND YEAH I MAY HAVE LOST A BIT OF CONTROL ME AND CLAIRE MAY HAVE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES 
BUT I'M NOT A LIAR AND I'M NOT A CHEAT 
SIR ALAN I DO GET OVER EXCITED SOMETIMES BUT I WANT TO PUT THIS AS ELOQUENTLY AS I CAN 
I DON'T WANT TO START GOING MENTAL BUT I WANT THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING 
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING IN MY LIFE 
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IF YOU'RE STILL APPREHENSIVE ABOUT ME WHICH I THINK YOU ARE 
I SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER GO AT PROJECT MANAGER TO SHOW YOU WHAT I CAN DO AGAIN 
AND PROVE TO YOU THAT I WASN'T A ONE HIT WONDER 
MICHAEL I CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT TELL LIES AND CHEAT IN MY ORGANISATION 
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU ARE A YOUNG MAN 
AND SOMETIMES I HAVE TO REFLECT BACK MYSELF 
ABOUT OVER ENTHUSIASM THAT I MIGHT HAVE HAD IN MY VERY YOUNG DAYS AROUND ABOUT YOUR AGE 
BUT WILL A LEOPARD CHANGE ITS SPOTS IT WILL 
SIR ALAN MICHAEL HAS QUALITIES THAT PERSONALLY 
IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY WHO CHEATS IN TASKS WHICH IS PRETTY EVIDENT THAT YOU DID 
I'M NOT A LIAR IT'S JUST BEEN PROVEN MICHAEL LET'S BE HONEST 
I'M NOT A LIAR AND A CHEAT TWICE YOU HAVE LIED YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED 
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHAT WENT ON WITH THE TENNIS RACQUET SO IF THAT'S THE KIND OF PERSON 
YOU WANT IN YOUR COMPANY FIRE ME NOW TO BE HONEST OH GOD 
TALK ABOUT MAKING A SCAPEGOAT I'M NOT MAKING A SCAPEGOAT 
YEAH YOU'RE A POLITICIAN OR SOMETHING NO I'M NOT A POLITICIAN 
SEE THE WAY THE WIND CHANGES LIKE THE WEATHER FORECAST HERE YOU KNOW 
SHE WAS HAMMER AND TONGS AGAINST YOU CLAIRE AND NOW SHE'S HOOKED ON TO SOMETHING ELSE 
THE CHEATING ANGLE THAT IS COMPLETELY UNTRUE YOU ASKED ME THAT'S NOT UNTRUE 
THAT IS TRUE I'VE GOT A PAIR OF EYES AS SHE SAID 
I'M BLESSED WITH A A PAIR OF EYES AND A PAIR OF EARS RIGHT 
I'M WATCHING THE WAY YOU GO ABOUT DOING THINGS THE WAY YOU GO ABOUT FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL FOR YOURSELF 
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY THE OTHER JENIFER WENT 
I'LL TELL YOU WHY SHE WENT BECAUSE I THINK SHE WAS A BIT OF A SNAKE 
I THINK SHE TAKES WORDS FROM MY MOUTH AND THEN TURNS IT ON PEOPLE IN THIS BOARDROOM 
CLAIRE ALEX SEEM TO THINK THAT YOU SCUPPERED ONE OF HIS NEGOTIATIONS 
AND THE SIXTY LOST ON THAT BED COVER COULD HAVE COST THIS TEAM A VICTORY 
BUT IT DIDN'T BECAUSE THE REAL LOSS 
WAS DUE TO MISTAKES THAT WERE MADE AND THOSE MISTAKES 
WERE BASED UPON WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE SOMEBODY OUT OF CONTROL 
SO JENNIFER YOU'RE FIRED 
THANK YOU 
I JUST HAD A FLASH OF WHEN I WAS TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD IN MY MIND 
AND THAT WHY YOU'RE STILL SITTING HERE 
O. K. YES SIR ALAN I KNOW A YOUNG PERSON CAN BE A LITTLE BIT OVER ENTHUSIASTIC TO SAY THE LEAST 
GO BACK TO THE HOUSE I'LL SEE YOU ON THE NEXT TASK 
THANK YOU SIR ALAN 
YOU'RE WITH PEOPLE WHO COME ACROSS AS FRIENDLY AND THEY WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU 
BUT IN HINDSIGHT THEY'RE JUST LOOKING FOR YOUR WEAK POINTS SO THEY CAN SCREW YOU OVER IN THE BOARDROOM 
AND IF HE WANTS TO HAVE SOMEBODY IN HIS COMPANY THAT HAS PROVED TO BE A BIT OF A CHEAT 
AND A BIT OF A SHIT REALLY I'D RATHER GO 
I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT TWICE BEFORE IT'S JUST PEOPLE TALKING UTTER SHIT 
I THINK IT'S MAKING ME TOUGHER 
MY NICKNAME AT WORK IS THE ROTTWEILER 
AND I THOUGHT I WAS GOING BACK TO A POODLE BUT I THINK I'M A ROTTWEILER AGAIN 
I DO TOO IT'S ALMOST LIKE I KNOW SOMEONE'S JEWISH 
HE PUT I'M A GOOD LITTLE JEWISH BOY ON HIS THAT'S HORRENDOUS 
I OBVIOUSLY I HOPE THEY ALL GET FIRED OBVIOUSLY 
BUT I THINK THEY'VE ALL SHOWN THAT THEY LACK ANY KIND OF INTEGRITY AND HONESTY 
I THINK MICHAEL PLAYING THE JEWISH CARD IS HILARIOUS 
HELLO OH CLAIRE 
CLAIRE ARE YOUR ON YOUR OWN 
OH MY GOD 
OH GOD OH MY GOD 
WAS IT FUCKING HORRENDOUS YEAH 
ONE JOB NOW EIGHT CANDIDATES REMAIN
