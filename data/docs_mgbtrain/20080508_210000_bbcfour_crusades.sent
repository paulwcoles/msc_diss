ALMOST ONE HUNDRED YEARS HAD PASSED 
SINCE THE ORIGINAL CRUSADE WHEN JERUSALEM HAD BEEN SEIZED IN AN ORGY OF BLOOD AND FIRE 
AND A EUROPEAN KINGDOM BUILT ON ITS RUINS 
BUT NOW SALADIN THE HERO OF ISLAM HAD DESTROYED THE CRUSADE KINGDOM'S ARMY AT THE BATTLE OF HATTIN 
AND HAD TAKEN BACK JERUSALEM 
IT WAS TIME FOR A NEW CRUSADE AND A CRUSADER TO MATCH SALADIN 
RICHARD THE LIONHEART ONE OF THE STARS OF ENGLISH HISTORY 
ACTUALLY HE WAS FRENCH RICHARD COEUR DE LION COULDN'T SPEAK A WORD OF ENGLISH 
NEVERTHELESS FOR THE BRITS HE IS THE GREATEST HERO OF THE CRUSADES 
THE WORLD HAD CHANGED SINCE THE FIRST CRUSADE 
THIS IS A FESTIVAL AT AIGUES MORTES IN SOUTHERN FRANCE AFTER ALL THE FRENCH INVENTED CHIVALRY 
THE CRUSADER KINGDOM WAS CALLED OUTREMER FRANCE OVERSEAS 
IN FACT CHIVALRY WAS REALLY BORN IN OUTREMER 
WHERE THE ONCE BARBARIC WARRIORS OF THE WEST LEARNED TO ENJOY LUXURY 
IN IMITATION OF THE SYRIAN COURTS 
ONE THING HAD NOT CHANGED KNIGHTS WERE STILL THUGS WHO ENJOYED BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF EACH OTHER 
THAT'S WHY THERE WAS GOING TO BE ANOTHER CRUSADE 
IT WAS JUST THAT NOW THEY WROTE POEMS ABOUT DOING IT AND EXPECTED LADIES TO ADMIRE THEM FOR IT 
RICHARD DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE BEEN TOO BOTHERED ABOUT THE LADIES 
RICHARD BECAME KING OF ENGLAND IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE 
HE ALSO RULED HALF OF FRANCE AND THERE WERE RUMOURS 
THAT HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE KING OF FRANCE PHILIP 
PUBLIC OPINION WAS SCANDALISED THAT NO ONE HAD GONE TO RESCUE THE HOLY LAND 
BUT RICHARD COULDN'T GO WITHOUT PHILIP 
THEY WERE QUITE A PAIR RICHARD GLAMOROUS AND DASHING PHILIP ONE EYED AND CAUTIOUS 
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BEST FRIENDS 
BUT NEITHER DARED LEAVE THE COUNTRY LEST THE OTHER TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEIZE HIS LANDS 
EVENTUALLY RICHARD AND PHILIP MET AT VEZELAY 
AND AGREED TO JOIN FORCES TO RESCUE THE HOLY LAND 
MEANWHILE THEY HAD RAISED A FORTUNE FOR THE WAR 
RICHARD'S MONEY RAISING FOR ALL THIS BECAME LEGENDARY HIS ONE REALISABLE ASSET WAS ENGLAND 
A PLACE THAT BORED HIM RIGID 
IT RAINED ALL THE TIME IT WAS FULL OF SHEEP 
AND THE INHABITANTS COULDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU SAID OU EST LE PATRON 
YOU COULDN'T EVEN HAVE A GOOD SCRAP BECAUSE TOURNAMENTS HAD BEEN BANNED 
BUT IT WAS NOTORIOUSLY PROSPEROUS BECAUSE OF THE WOOL TRADE 
AND RICHARD WAS PREPARED TO CASH IN THE LOT 
HE MADE EVERYONE PAY A NEW TAX THE SALADIN TITHE 
AND HE WAS READY TO SELL OFF ROYAL LANDS CASTLES EVEN WHOLE CITIES 
I WOULD SELL LONDON IF I HAD A BUYER 
HMM 
WHY DID RICHARD NEED ALL THE MONEY 
WELL I SUPPOSE IT'S OVER FIFTY YEARS SINCE THE LAST CRUSADE 
MAYBE THE TECHNOLOGY OF WARFARE HAS MOVED ON 
I'M HERE TO ASK FRANK CRADDOCK PROBABLY THE LAST MAN IN ENGLAND WHO COULD FIT OUT A CRUSADING ARMY WHY IS ARMOUR SO EXPENSIVE IT'S ONLY BITS OF METAL 
THAT'S THE POPULAR IMPRESSION 
A CROSS BETWEEN RAMBO AND CONAN THE BARBARIAN 
THUNDERING AWAY WITH A HAMMER ON SOME HOT METAL 
IT WAS ACTUALLY A VERY DELICATE OPERATION 
THE ARMOURER WAS PRODUCING VERY FINE DELICATE RINGS LIKE THIS 
AND RIVETING THEM TOGETHER VERY TINY RIVETS EVERY SINGLE RING IS RIVETED 
YEAH IN THIS PROBABLY ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND TO SEVENTY THOUSAND RINGS SO IT'S A DOUBLE CHAIN DOUBLE THICK 
YOU COULD GO BLIND DOING THAT SORT OF THING YEAH CHILD LABOUR WAS USED ON OCCASION 
AND PEOPLE COULD GO BLIND ESPECIALLY IN POOR LIGHT SO WHAT WOULD THAT SET ME BACK THAT SUIT 
ARMOUR HELMET SWORD THE PRICE OF A GOOD FOUR BEDROOMED HOUSE THESE DAYS NOT CHEAP 
YEAH THE ARMOUR YOU'RE WEARING NOW THIS TOTALLY WRONG WHAT'S WRONG ALL WRONG FOR THE THIRD CRUSADE 
THE HELMET IS A NORMAN HELMET CONVERTED INTO A POTTY OR SOMETHING 
THE SLEEVES ARE TOO SHORT IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST CRUSADE 
THAT WAS YEARS AGO 
YOU NEED A TOTAL NEW SUIT FROM START TO FINISH NEW WEAPONS WE'D BETTER DO IT THEN LET'S GO 
OH BLOODY HELL THERE YOU GO SO THIS IS WHAT A WELL DRESSED TWELFTH CENTURY KNIGHT WOULD WEAR 
YEAH FOR RICHARD'S CRUSADE WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS 
THE PIG STICKER THIS SWORD HAD GONE OUT OF FASHION FOR HIGH RANKING KNIGHTS IT WAS TOO SHORT 
YOU CAN'T REACH DOWN THERE YOU'RE LEANING OVER YOUR HORSE AND WHAT DO I HAVE INSTEAD A LONGER ONE 
A SWORD OF WAR OOH THAT'S VERY NICE ISN'T IT 
THAT'S FAR BETTER FORGED BEAUTIFUL IT'S LONGER 
GIVES YOU THE REACH IT'S HEAVY YEAH 
BUT IT GIVES YOU THAT REACH TO CUT DOWNWARDS WITH GREAT WEIGHT 
UP ON MY HORSE SLASHING AWAY AT THE PEASANTS 
THE KIND OF THING RICHARD HAD DICKY WOULD HAVE BEEN SWINGING THAT AT ALL AND SUNDRY 
THIS CRUSADE WAS A PROFESSIONALLY ORGANISED ROYAL PROJECT 
NOT A MASS MOVEMENT LIKE THE ORIGINAL CRUSADE 
THE THIRD CRUSADE ALL THE SOURCES TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS 
OFTEN FROM CERTAIN AREAS YORKSHIRE A LOT OF CRUSADERS FOR SOME REASON GO FROM YORKSHIRE 
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS NOT TENS OF THOUSANDS 
SO IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS IN A POPULATION OF ONE AND A HALF TO TWO MILLION 
THAT'S THE SORT OF LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT 
THEY WERE GOING TO A SHATTERED KINGDOM THE KINGDOM OF JERUSALEM HAD DISAPPEARED 
ALL THAT REMAINED OF IT WAS A TINY ENCLAVE AROUND THE PORT OF TYRE BUT NO ONE WAS GIVING UP 
IN FACT THE SURVIVORS HAD SPENT TWO YEARS BESIEGING THE NEXT PORT ACRE TRYING TO RECAPTURE IT 
ACRE WAS A CITY THAT WAS CREATED AND DESTROYED BY THE CRUSADES 
WHEN RICHARD AND PHILIP ARRIVED THIS VERY CITADEL WAS IN THE HANDS OF SALADIN'S TROOPS 
THEY'D BEEN UNDER SIEGE FOR TWO YEARS WHY SO LONG BECAUSE THEY COULD ALWAYS GET SUPPLIES BY SEA 
BUT RICHARD AND PHILIP HAD A BIG ENOUGH FLEET TO STOP ALL THAT 
AND STARTED BATTERING THE CITY WALLS WITH HUGE SIEGE ENGINES 
WITH NAMES LIKE GOD'S CATAPULT AND BAD NEIGHBOUR 
HEAVE 
HEAVE 
BY NOW SIEGE ARTILLERY WAS CAPABLE OF INFLICTING SERIOUS DAMAGE 
AS LARGE BEAMS WERE BEING SHIPPED IN FROM EUROPE THE PAYLOADS ROSE TOWARDS A QUARTER OF A TON 
ENOUGH TO DAMAGE ANY WALL 
EVENTUALLY ON JULY TWELFTH ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY ONE 
THE SARACEN GARRISON CAPITULATED 
IT WAS AGREED THAT THE MUSLIMS WOULD BE SET FREE 
IN RETURN FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND GOLD DINARS ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CHRISTIAN PRISONERS 
AND THE HOLIEST OF HOLY RELICS THE FRAGMENT OF THE TRUE CROSS THAT SALADIN CAPTURED AT HATTIN 
BUT IT DIDN'T TURN OUT LIKE THAT THE GARRISON HAD COME TO THESE TERMS WITHOUT REFERRING TO SALADIN 
AND THERE WAS NO WAY HE COULD RAISE THAT SORT OF MONEY IN THE TIME 
RICHARD IMPATIENT TO GET ON TO JERUSALEM GREW TIRED OF WAITING 
SO HE HAD THE ENTIRE GARRISON CHAINED UP OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS ALONG WITH THEIR WIVES AND FAMILIES 
AND SLAUGHTERED THEM IT TOOK THREE DAYS TO KILL THEM ALL 
ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THE CRUSADES WERE BOLD AND HEROIC 
NEEDS TO JUSTIFY THE MURDER OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO WERE TOO MUCH OF A NUISANCE TO KEEP ALIVE 
NO MUSLIM ARMY HAD EVER TREATED CHRISTIANS WITH THIS MECHANICAL BARBARITY 
ACRE OFFERED COMFORT AND RELAXATION 
AFTER THE RIGOURS OF WAR CAME THE PLEASURES OF A LARGE PORT 
TINTED AND PAINTED DESIRABLE AND APPETISING 
BOLD AND ARDENT WITH NASAL VOICES AND FLESHY THIGHS THEY OFFERED THEIR WARES FOR ENJOYMENT 
THIS IS SALADIN'S SECRETARY DESCRIBING A BOATLOAD OF EUROPEAN PROSTITUTES 
PLAINLY HE NEVER GOT INVITED TO THESE SORTS OF PARTIES 
WESTERN HISTORIANS INSIST THAT IT WAS HIS IMAGINATION BUT MAYBE THEY DON'T GET INVITED TO THEM EITHER 
CAUGHT LIZARD AFTER LIZARD IN THEIR HOLES 
GUIDED PENS TO INKWELLS TORRENTS TO THE VALLEY BOTTOM SWORDS TO SCABBARDS 
MAINTAINING THAT THIS WAS AN ACT OF PIETY 
ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO WERE FAR FROM HOME AND WIVES 
ACCORDING TO POPULAR BELIEF THE WIVES WERE LOCKED UP IN CHASTITY BELTS 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE IDEA THAT WIVES OF CRUSADERS WORE CHASTITY BELTS 
GENUINE CHASTITY BELTS DO NOT SURVIVE 
THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF THE SIEGE OF LISBON ON THE SECOND CRUSADE 
WHERE THE MOORS ON THE WALLS TAUNT THE CRUSADERS 
BY REMINDING THEM OF WHAT THEIR WIVES MIGHT BE UP TO AT HOME 
THE MAIN DANGER FOR A CRUSADER'S WIFE WAS THAT SHE WOULD BE ATTACKED 
EITHER LEGALLY AND HER PROPERTY TAKEN BY SOMEBODY ELSE OR PHYSICALLY 
A NUMBER OF CRUSADER'S WIVES WERE MURDERED FOR THEIR PROPERTY IT WAS QUITE RISKY TO BE A CRUSADER'S WIFE 
THE MAIN RISK FOR A CRUSADER WAS DISEASE OF ALL KINDS 
PHILIP BECAME VERY ILL AND DECIDED HE'D HAD ENOUGH 
RICHARD FIGURED THAT HE HAD TIME TO CAPTURE JERUSALEM AND GET BACK TO DEFEND HIS LANDS FROM PHILIP 
BUT HE HAD TO MOVE FAST 
RICHARD FOUND IT HARD TO DRAG HIS MEN AWAY FROM THE DELIGHTS AT ACRE 
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE FORBADE ANY WOMEN ON THE MARCH APART FROM WASHERWOMEN 
WHO WOULD NOT BE A BURDEN TO THEM NOR THE OCCASION OF SIN 
SIR STEVEN RUNCIMAN'S THREE VOLUME HISTORY OF THE CRUSADES QUOTES FROM ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE STUDIES ON THE SUBJECT 
AND IN THE FOLLOWING FORTY YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED BOOKS ON THE CRUSADES 
BUT IN THESE SEVEN HUNDRED TOMES NOT ONE EVEN BEGINS TO EXPLAIN 
WHY WASHERWOMEN WERE NOT THE OCCASION FOR SIN 
THERE CLEARLY NEEDS TO BE A LOT MORE RESEARCH 
ON THE SUBJECT OF CRUSADER WASHERWOMEN 
AT THE SIEGE OF ANTIOCH WHEN THE CRUSADERS WERE STARVING AND DESPERATE 
AND NEEDED TO BUILD UP THEIR BANK BALANCE OF DIVINE APPROVAL THEY EJECTED ALL THE PROSTITUTES 
BUT THE WASHERWOMEN STAYED 
HENRY THE SECOND OF ENGLAND PLANNING A CRUSADE THAT HE NEVER MADE 
AFTER BATTLE FIRST THING THEY DID WAS TO RANSOM CAPTURED WASHERWOMEN 
WHAT WAS SO SPECIAL ABOUT THESE LADIES 
THE IDEA WAS THAT CRUSADERS SHOULD EM 
ABSTAIN FROM SEX DURING THE CRUSADE IT WAS A PENITENTIAL ACTIVITY AFTER ALL 
IT WAS CONVENIENT OF COURSE AS AN EXCUSE FOR FAILURE THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T ABSTAIN FROM SEX 
DEFEAT WAS OFTEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE LUST OF THE CRUSADERS 
WASHERWOMEN WERE ALLOWED BECAUSE THEY WERE OLD UGLY OR NOT 
BUT THEY WERE IMPORTANT IN MAKING THE CRUSADERS' LIVES LESS HELLISH BY REGULARLY DELOUSING THEM 
AFTER LEAVING ACRE THE WASHERWOMEN WALKED SOUTH ALONG THE SHORE ALONG WITH THE BAGGAGE TRAIN 
THEY WERE PROTECTED BY KNIGHTS RIDING INSHORE AND BY THE INFANTRY MARCHING EVEN FURTHER INSHORE 
OFFSHORE WAS THE FLEET WHO PROVIDED ALL THE SUPPLIES 
THEY WERE SOME ATTACKS ON THE BAGGAGE TRAIN AND WASHERWOMEN 
BUT THE KNIGHTS DROVE THEM BACK HANGING THEIR SEVERED HEADS FROM SADDLES MORE WORK FOR WASHERWOMEN 
WHEN THE MUSLIMS DID CAPTURE A FEW PRISONERS SALADIN HAD THE SOLDIERS EXECUTED 
BUT THE WASHERWOMEN HE RETURNED SAFE AND SOUND TO RICHARD'S ARMY 
RICHARD WAS MARCHING SIXTY MILES DOWN THE COAST TO THE PORT OF JAFFA 
FROM THERE HE COULD STRIKE INLAND TO JERUSALEM 
FOR TWO WEEKS HIS ARMY MARCHED IN PERFECT FORMATION DOWN THE COAST 
AND THERE WAS NOTHING SALADIN COULD DO TO STOP THEM 
THE FELT MAKERS WERE THE REAL HEROES OF THE STORY 
EVERY FOOT SOLDIER WORE ARMOUR MADE OF VERY HEAVY FELT 
AND SO STOUT A COAT OF MAIL THAT OUR ARROWS DID NO HARM 
I SAW SOLDIERS WITH TEN ARROWS IN THEIR BACK MARCHING AS USUAL 
ONE COULD NOT HELP ADMIRING THEIR PATIENCE 
RICHARD REACHED JAFFA SAFELY HE WAS MASTER OF THE COAST 
NOW HE WAS READY FOR THE MARCH INLAND TO RECAPTURE JERUSALEM 
BUT SALADIN'S POWER INLAND REMAINED INTACT 
EVEN IF RICHARD MANAGED TO CAPTURE THE CITY SALADIN WOULD JUST RETAKE IT WHEN HE LEFT 
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY POINTLESS 
RICHARD DESPERATELY NEEDED A TREATY WITH SALADIN THAT WOULD LET HIM OFF THE HOOK 
MEN OF OURS AND OF YOURS HAVE DIED THE COUNTRY IS IN RUINS AND EVENTS HAVE ESCAPED ANYONE'S CONTROL 
DO YOU NOT BELIEVE IT IS ENOUGH LET US PUT AN END TO THIS EXHAUSTING STRUGGLE 
THIS LAND HAS ALWAYS BEEN OURS AND YOUR OCCUPATION IS ONLY FOR A SHORT WHILE 
SO LONG AS THERE IS WAR WE WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO ENJOY YOUR POSSESSIONS 
WE MUST MEET TO DISCUSS THESE THINGS KINGS MEET ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE AGREED 
IN ANY EVENT WE NEED A TRANSLATOR IN WHOM WE BOTH HAVE CONFIDENCE 
LET THAT MAN ACT AS A MESSENGER BETWEEN US 
WHEN WE HAVE ARRIVED AT AN UNDERSTANDING WE WILL MEET AND FRIENDSHIP WILL PREVAIL BETWEEN US 
RICHARD AND SALADIN NEVER ACTUALLY MET 
BUT COMMUNICATED VIA A GO BETWEEN SALADIN'S BROTHER AL ADIL 
NOW RICHARD AND AL ADIL GOT ON SO WELL THAT RICHARD SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT THE WAR WAS ABOUT 
NOT ONLY DID HE KNIGHT AL ADIL'S SON BUT IN OCTOBER ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY ONE HE MADE A STARTLING PROPOSITION 
RICHARD PROPOSED THAT HIS SISTER JOANNA SHOULD MARRY SALADIN'S BROTHER 
THE TWO COULD JOINTLY RULE PALESTINE END OF PROBLEM 
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN 
ARAB HISTORIAN PROF ZAKKAR HAS EVIDENCE THAT PUTS A SINISTER INTERPRETATION ON THE STORY 
FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS SOME UNPUBLISHED 
SHOW THAT AL ADIL HOPED TO SEIZE THE KINGDOM FROM HIS BROTHER 
SALAH ED DIN WHY SHOULD HE SIGN A TREATY WITH RICHARD COEUR DE LION 
WHEN RICHARD IS LEAVING THE COUNTRY AND GOING BACK TO EUROPE LEAVING ONLY A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE AT ACRE 
THIS MAN WHO WAS THE GREAT CHAMPION OF THE DAY OF HATTIN 
WHY HE SHOULD MAKE A TREATY WITH RICHARD 
IF HE WAS NOT FACING REAL TROUBLES AT HOME 
SALADIN HAD TO MAKE A TREATY WITH RICHARD BEFORE HIS BROTHER DID OR HE MIGHT LOSE HIS KINGDOM 
RICHARD ALSO NEEDED A TREATY 
THERE WAS NO POINT CONQUERING JERUSALEM 
UNLESS HE WAS GOING TO STAY FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE DEFENDING IT 
HE WENT BACK TO ACRE AND PREPARED TO GO HOME 
A FACE SAVING PEACE TREATY WAS VIRTUALLY COMPLETE 
WHEN SUDDENLY SALADIN'S ARMY ATTACKED AND SEIZED JAFFA 
SALADIN HAD LOST CONTROL 
HIS TROOPS MASSACRED THE MEN INSIDE THEY WANTED REVENGE FOR ACRE 
IN FACT SALADIN WAS SO ALARMED AT WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
THAT HE TOLD THE CHRISTIAN GARRISON TO SHELTER INSIDE THE CITADEL UNTIL HE COULD REGAIN CONTROL OF HIS ARMY 
RICHARD SAILED QUICKLY DOWN FROM ACRE WITH A SMALL FORCE BUT HE DIDN'T DARE LAND AT JAFFA 
UNTIL A PRIEST MANAGED TO SWIM OUT AND TELL HIM THAT THE GARRISON WAS STILL HOLDING OUT 
RICHARD STRIPPED OFF HIS LEGGINGS AND WADED ASHORE WITH HIS MEN 
THE LOCALS TELL US THAT IF YOU JUMP INTO THE SEA HERE IN HEAVY ARMOUR 
YOU'LL EITHER SINK INTO THE SAND OR GET KNOCKED OVER BY THE WAVES 
SO WE'RE GOING TO CARRY OUT AN EXPERIMENT 
I'M GOING TO SEE IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO INVADE JAFFA FROM THE BEACH 
SO WISH ME LUCK CHAPS 
WHERE ARE WE HERE WE GO OH 
RIGHT WELL I HAVEN'T SUNK INTO THE SAND SO FAR OR BEEN KNOCKED OVER BY A WAVE 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A DEFINITE YES IT'S POSSIBLE 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT HAPPENED TO RICHARD 
NO ONE IS HELD IN ESTEEM UNTIL HE HAS BLOWS BOTH GIVEN AND TAKEN NOTHING SO SATISFIES ME 
ON WITH THE CHARGE 
IN NONE OF THESE JOYS DO I FIND WHAT I FEEL WHEN I HEAR THE SOUND OF ANTHEM 
RICHARD CAMPED OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF JAFFA BUT SALADIN STRUCK BACK HE HAD OVER SEVEN THOUSAND CAVALRY 
WHEREAS RICHARD COULD ONLY MANAGE ABOUT FIFTY FOUR KNIGHTS A MERE FIFTEEN HORSES AND ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED INFANTRY 
IT WAS THE STUFF OF LEGENDS 
NEVER WAS THERE SUCH AN ATTACK MADE BY AN INDIVIDUAL 
HE PIERCED INTO THE HOSTILE ARMY 
OUR MEN LOSING SIGHT OF THE KING WERE FEARFUL LEST HE SHOULD BE SLAIN 
BUT KING RICHARD INURED TO BATTLE FROM HIS TENDEREST YEARS REMAINED INVINCIBLE 
HIS BODY AS IF IT WERE MADE OF BRASS WAS IMPENETRABLE TO ANY WEAPON 
IN HIS RIGHT HAND HE BRANDISHED HIS SWORD 
AND WHEN I SEE DEAD MEN WHO STILL HAVE PENNANT LANCES IN THEIR RIBS 
WE HAVE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TWO THINGS ROMANCE AND REAL HISTORY 
TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ROMANCE AND REAL HISTORY 
WE HAVE TO USE MORE THAN ONE SOURCE AND IN MANY LANGUAGES 
THIS MANUSCRIPT HASN'T BEEN PUBLISHED BEFORE 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME EDITED AND NOW HANDED TO THE PRESS BY ME 
SALAH ED DIN ORDERED HIS MEN TO CAPTURE RICHARD COEUR DE LION THEY REFUSED 
SALADIN SALAH ED DIN'S OWN SOLDIERS REFUSED YES WHY 
THAT MAN LOST HIS CONTROL UPON HIS ARMIES 
AND LOST HIS CONTROL UPON HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD 
SO THE GREAT BATTLE MUST HAVE BEEN IMPROVED ON BY THE CHRONICLERS 
MOST OF SALADIN'S ARMY HAD MUTINIED AND REFUSED TO FIGHT RICHARD 
BOTH SIDES NEEDED TO END THE WAR THEY STRUCK A DEAL 
SALADIN WOULD ALLOW CHRISTIAN PRIESTS INTO THE HOLY PLACES 
THE CRUSADERS COULD KEEP THE COAST IF THEY DISMANTLED THE FORT AT ASCALON 
ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF AUGUST ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO THE TREATY WAS SIGNED 
MANY CRUSADERS VISITED JERUSALEM AS SALADIN'S GUESTS 
BUT RICHARD HAD SWORN ONLY TO SET EYES ON THE CITY AS ITS CONQUEROR 
HE SET OUT FOR HOME 
HIS JOURNEY HOME WAS ERRATIC HE WAS FOUND TRAVELLING IN DISGUISE THROUGH AUSTRIA 
HE WAS SEIZED FOR RANSOM 
RICHARD WAS AN EXTREMELY UNDESIRABLE MAN 
HE WAS A BAD SON A BAD HUSBAND A VERY BAD RULER 
BUT HE WAS A MAGNIFICENT SOLDIER WHO TOOK A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE OVER HIS MEN 
SO IN A WAY IT WAS EASY TO MAKE A HERO OF HIM 
WHILE RICHARD LANGUISHED IN JAIL AWAITING SOMEONE TO PAY HIS RANSOM 
AND ACCORDING TO LEGEND BEING HUNTED BY HIS MINSTREL BLONDEL 
BASTIONS BROKEN DOWN AND SHATTERED 
SALADIN DIED 
SALADIN BECAME A LEGEND IN EUROPE 
TO THE PREACHERS HE WAS ANTICHRIST BUT TO MANY OTHERS HE REPRESENTED THE ESSENCE OF CHIVALRY 
THE MODEL OF THE PERFECT KNIGHT 
WHEN RICHARD WAS SICK SALADIN SENT HIM A DOCTOR AND SNOW FOR HIS FEVER 
AND IN WAR HE PROTECTED DEFEATED CIVILIANS FROM HIS OWN SOLDIERS 
I THINK HE DESERVES THE ADMIRATION OF A MAN LIKE RICHARD THE LIONHEART 
AND MANY CRUSADER KNIGHTS 
WHO BELIEVE THAT HE IS MAYBE THE ULTIMATE SYMBOL OF KNIGHTHOOD 
HE IS ONE OF MY GREATEST HEROES 
SALADIN HAD NO INTEREST IN PERSONAL WEALTH 
HE DIDN'T OWN A SINGLE HOUSE EVEN HIS SHROUD HAD TO BE BORROWED 
HE IS A MYSTERY RIGHT DOWN TO THE FACT THAT HE HAS TWO TOMBS 
AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH ONE HE'S ACTUALLY BURIED UNDER 
EVEN DEAD IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PIN THE MAN DOWN 
THE TWO TOMBS ALSO REPRESENT TWO PERCEPTIONS OF THE MAN 
THIS HOMELY WOODEN ONE IS THE TOMB HIS COUNTRYMEN PUT UP TO HIM 
BUT THE WEST HAD A HIGHER OPINION OF SALADIN AND IN THE LAST CENTURY THE GERMAN KAISER INSISTED ON THIS 
A MARBLE MONSTROSITY TO COMMEMORATE SALADIN AS THE WEST SEES HIM AS ONE OF THE GREAT HEROES OF HISTORY 
PEOPLE NOT ONLY THINK ABOUT HIM AS SOMETHING OUT OF THE PAST 
PEOPLE NORMALLY WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT FIGURES LIKE THIS 
IN THEIR MINDS HE CONTINUES TO EXIST 
SO IN SOME MANNER OR ANOTHER THEY ALWAYS HOPE FOR HIS REAPPEARANCE 
ESPECIALLY NOW WITH THE PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH ISRAEL OVER PALESTINE 
SALADIN IS A HERO FOR DIPLOMATS NOT HARDLINERS 
HE DIDN'T DRIVE THE KINGDOM OF JERUSALEM INTO THE SEA 
MAYBE THAT'S WHY THE WEST HAS BEEN KEEN FOR ARABS TO IDOLISE HIM 
BUT SALADIN WAS NOT THE TRUE HERO OF THE ARAB STORY OF THE CRUSADES 
THAT WAS A MAN WHOSE NAME IS BLOTTED OUT FROM EUROPE'S MEMORY 
BAYBARS IS THE HERO WHOSE DEEDS ARE TOLD BY SYRIAN CAFE STORY TELLERS 
BAYBARS WAS AS MERCILESS AND BRUTAL AS THE CRUSADERS THEMSELVES 
BUT WHAT HE ACHIEVED LASTED A LOT LONGER 
EUROPE NEVER HAD ANY INTENTION OF RESPECTING THE PEACE WITH SALADIN 
THE CHURCH COULDN'T TOLERATE PEACE WITH MUSLIMS 
IT WOULD TAKE FIFTY YEARS OF PROVOCATION BY THE CHRISTIANS TO PRODUCE A MAN LIKE BAYBARS 
OYEZ NOBLES SEIGNEURS LES CAVALIERS VOLTIGEANTS DE FRANCE 
IT'S NOVEMBER ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY NINE A GROUP OF FRENCH KNIGHTS MEET AT A TOURNAMENT 
AND DECIDE IN EFFECT TO SELL TICKETS FOR A PACKAGE CRUSADE 
THE AIM TO ATTACK THE WEALTH OF EGYPT AND THEN ON TO JERUSALEM 
THE ORGANISERS SENT AGENTS TO VENICE TO NEGOTIATE THE CONTRACT FOR SHIPS AND SUPPLIES 
AND THIS IS WHERE IT ALL STARTED TO GO WRONG 
THE VENETIANS DREW THE CRUSADE NEGOTIATORS INTO A FANTASY WORLD 
THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE HANDLED BY A BLIND EIGHTY YEAR OLD MERCHANT ENRICO DANDOLO THE DOGE 
THE RULER OF VENICE 
HIS PLAN WAS TO SEDUCE THE CRUSADE INTO BANKRUPTCY AND TAKE IT OVER 
THE ORGANISERS ENTERED THE WORLD OF MAKE BELIEVE 
DANDOLO GOT THEM TO CONTRACT FOR THREE TIMES THE POPULATION OF RICHARD'S CRUSADE 
AND AT SIX TIMES THE COST 
THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING 
YOU SEE VENICE DID GOOD BUSINESS WITH THE ARABS 
AND PROMISED THAT THE CRUSADE WOULD NEVER ARRIVE 
EVERYTHING THE CRUSADERS WERE BEING OFFERED HAD AN ILLUSORY QUALITY 
RIGHT NOW IT WAS THEIRS 
BUT WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK MIDNIGHT THEY WOULD BE UP THE PROVERBIAL CANAL WITHOUT A PUMPKIN 
WELL THE CRUSADE LEADERS ARRIVED IN VENICE FEELING VERY PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES 
AND WAITED FOR THEIR THIRTY THREE THOUSAND TROOPS TO JOIN THEM 
THE PAYING CUSTOMERS BEGAN TO ARRIVE AND WERE ACCOMMODATED IN THE LUXURY THEY EXPECTED 
BUT IT GRADUALLY BECAME CLEAR THAT INSTEAD OF THIRTY THREE THOUSAND CRUSADERS THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TEN THOUSAND 
WELL THE VENETIANS GAVE THE CRUSADERS EVERYTHING THEY ASKED FOR BUT THEY'D ASKED FOR A BIT TOO MUCH 
THEY NEEDED AT LEAST THREE TIMES AS MANY CRUSADERS TO PAY THE BILL 
THE CRUSADERS WERE DEEP IN DEBT TO THE VENETIANS AND HAD NO IDEA HOW TO PAY 
AND THEN THE OLD DOGE OF VENICE SUDDENLY APPEARED WITH A TOTALLY UNEXPECTED OFFER 
VIVA IL DOGE 
HE WAS OVER EIGHTY AND TOTALLY BLIND BUT HE WAS NOBODY'S FOOL 
HE HAD A CROSS FIXED TO HIS CAP WHERE EVERYONE COULD SEE IT 
AND THOUSANDS OF VENETIANS JOINED THE CRUSADE 
BUT DOGE DANDOLO WAS NOT LEADING THEM TO EGYPT OR TO JERUSALEM 
HE WAS LEADING THEM TO A CONQUEST THAT WOULD PAY THEIR DEBT AND MAKE HIM MASTER OF IMMEASURABLE WEALTH 
IN A GREAT EASTERN CITY THERE HAD BEEN A REVOLUTION 
THE HEIR WAS OFFERING A FORTUNE TO BE PUT BACK ON HIS THRONE 
THIS WAS THE GREATEST PRIZE IN THE WORLD AND THE CRUSADERS WOULD TAKE IT FOR DOGE DANDOLO 
CONSTANTINOPLE THE MIGHTIEST OF CHRISTIAN CITIES 
THE CITY WHICH HAD BEGUN THE CRUSADES ONE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE 
BY ASKING FOR HELP AGAINST THE TURKS 
WAS NOW TO BE ATTACKED BY THE VERY FORCES DESIGNED TO PROTECT IT 
THE CITY WAS WEAKLY DEFENDED 
THE HEIR REGAINED HIS THRONE BUT HAD NO MONEY FOR THE CRUSADERS 
SO THEY TORE THE CITY TO PIECES 
THE SACK OF CONSTANINOPLE WAS THE MOST GROTESQUE OF ALL THE BARBAROUS ACTS OF THE EUROPEAN BARBARIANS 
LOGIC AND RELIGION WERE USED TO JUSTIFY EVERYTHING THESE WERE BARBARIANS WITH THEOLOGY 
KILLING BYZANTINE GREEKS MIGHT BE A MORAL DUTY AND OF COURSE A PLEASURE 
BUT THE MONEY WAS WHAT MATTERED 
GEOFFREY DE VILLEHARDOUIN HERE DECLARES 
THAT TO HIS KNOWLEDGE SO MUCH BOOTY HAD NEVER BEEN GAINED IN ANY CITY SINCE THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 
THE TREASURES OF THE GREAT CHURCH OF HAGHIA SOPHIA 
BECAME LOOT GOLD FOR THE KNIGHTS HOLY RELICS FOR THE PRIESTS WHO BLESSED THEM 
THE PRIESTS FOUND ARGUMENTS TO JUSTIFY EVERY OUTRAGE 
THEY DECLARED THAT THE CRUSADERS HAD COMPLETED THEIR VOWS AS IF THEY HAD CONQUERED JERUSALEM 
AND A PROSTITUTE SAT ON THE PATRIARCH'S THRONE 
WELL NOW ROLL JORDAN ROLL 
ROLL JORDAN ROLL 
I WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN WHEN I DIE TO HEAR MY JORDAN ROLL 
WHEN I ROLL JORDAN ROLL 
ROLL JORDAN ROLL 
I WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN WHEN I DIE TO HEAR MY JORDAN ROLL 
EVERYBODY 
BROTHER WON'T YOU BE THERE YES MY LORD 
THIS WAS THE END OF THE GREAT JOURNEY TO SAVE JERUSALEM AND MAKE THE WORLD INTO CHRIST'S PATRIMONY 
NOT A SINGLE MUSLIM DIED AT THE HANDS OF THE FOURTH CRUSADE 
THE STOLEN TREASURES ARE STILL PROUDLY DISPLAYED IN VENICE 
SAINT MARK'S IN VENICE CONTAINS THE LAST REMNANTS OF BYZANTIUM'S WEALTH 
THE HORSES OF CONSTANTINE'S HIPPODROME WERE BROUGHT BACK TO LOOK OUT OVER SAINT MARK'S SQUARE 
AND IN HAGHIA SOPHIA IN CONSTANTINOPLE ONCE THE GREATEST CHURCH IN CHRISTENDOM 
THE OLD BLIND DOGE WAS FINALLY LAID TO REST HIS NICHE IN HISTORY ASSURED 
A MORE SAVAGE ENEMY OF THE CHURCH THAN ANY ISLAMIC CONQUEROR 
HEAR THE JORDAN ROLL WELL NOW 
ROLL JORDAN ROLL 
ROLL JORDAN ROLL 
I WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN WHEN I DIE TO HEAR THAT JORDAN ROLL 
BRAVO 
THE MUSLIM WORLD WAS UNHARMED AND THE REMNANT OF THE CRUSADER STATE WAS AS FRAGILE AS EVER 
ITS STRONGHOLDS HAD THICK WALLS BUT WERE THINLY MANNED 
THEIR SURVIVAL DEPENDED ON PEACE 
BUT THE WEST WAS LOCKED IN A FANTASY OF CHRISTIAN CHIVALRY CELEBRATED IN STORIES AND BALLADS 
THESE PUPPETS ARE SICILIAN 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THERE WAS A CRUSADE AGAINST EGYPT 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THERE WAS ANOTHER 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER 
EVEN WHEN ISLAMIC LEADERS OFFERED TO GIVE BACK JERUSALEM IN ORDER TO GET SOME PEACE THEY WERE SPURNED 
A GOOD CHRISTIAN DID NOT NEGOTIATE WITH MUSLIMS HE TRIED INEFFECTUALLY TO WIPE THEM OUT 
EVENTUALLY THE EGYPTIAN ARMY HAD HAD ENOUGH 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY A GROUP OF REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS SEIZED POWER IN EGYPT 
SALADIN'S FAMILY WERE KICKED ASIDE THE MESSAGE NOW WAS NO MORE MR. NICE GUY 
THE LEADER OF THE COUP WAS A SLAVE BAYBARS 
BAYBARS WAS LEADER OF THE MAMELUKS 
NOW THE MAMELUKS WERE THE SLAVE SOLDIERS OF EGYPT 
THEY WERE CAPTURED AS CHILDREN AND TRAINED UP EXCLUSIVELY AS WARRIORS 
THEY HAD BEEN HARDENED IN OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF BATTLES WITH CRUSADERS 
UNDER BAYBARS THE MAMELUKS SWEPT EVERYTHING BEFORE THEM 
THEY CREATED A STATE WHOSE WHOLE PURPOSE WAS WAR THEIR FIRST TARGET WAS ANTIOCH 
IT WAS CAPTURED THE GATES SEALED AND EVERY CHRISTIAN MAN WOMAN AND CHILD 
WAS BUTCHERED 
THE CHRISTIAN PRINCE OF ANTIOCH WASN'T THERE SO BAYBARS SENT HIM A LETTER TELLING HIM WHAT HE'D MISSED 
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN YOUR KNIGHTS PROSTRATE BENEATH THE HORSES' HOOVES 
THE CROSSES IN YOUR CHURCHES SMASHED THE PAGES OF THE FALSE TESTAMENTS SCATTERED 
THE PATRIARCH'S TOMBS OVERTURNED 
YOUR MUSLIM ENEMY TRAMPLING ON THE PLACE WHERE YOU CELEBRATE MASS 
CUTTING THE THROATS OF MONKS PRIESTS AND DEACONS 
SINCE NO SURVIVOR HAS COME FORWARD TO TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WE HAVE INFORMED YOU OF IT 
SINCE NO ONE CAN GIVE YOU THE GOOD NEWS THAT YOU HAVE SAVED YOUR LIFE AT THE LOSS OF EVERYTHING ELSE 
WE BRING YOU THE TIDINGS IN A PERSONAL LETTER 
THE MAMELUKS DESTROYED TOWN AFTER TOWN KILLING THE INHABITANTS 
DESTROYING THE LAST REMNANTS OF THE CRUSADER KINGDOM 
THE FINAL STRONGHOLD WAS IN ACRE BY THIS TIME THE MOST CORRUPT PORT IN THE MEDITERRANEAN 
A PENAL COLONY OF WRONGDOERS FROM ALL OVER EUROPE SENT HERE AS PENANCE THEY NEVER STOOD A CHANCE 
JUST AS THE CHRISTIANS HAD ONCE BATHED JERUSALEM IN MUSLIM BLOOD 
NOW THE STONES OF ACRE RAN RED AS CHRISTIANS WERE BUTCHERED 
THE MAMELUKS THEN DESTROYED EVERY BUILDING AND ALL THE VEGETATION RIGHT DOWN THE COAST 
CREATING A DESERT WHICH OFFERED NO TOE HOLD FOR ANY FUTURE CRUSADE 
FURTHER INLAND CHURCHES WERE TURNED INTO MOSQUES 
EVEN IN THE MIGHTIEST CRUSADER FORTRESS THE CALL TO PRAYER NOW SOUNDED 
IT TOOK TWO HUNDRED YEARS FOR THE CRUSADERS TO CREATE THIS ISLAMIC FANATICISM 
BUT THEY HAD DONE IT IT WAS AN IMITATION OF THEIR OWN INTOLERANCE 
I SUPPOSE ONE OF THE GREAT GIFTS OF RELIGION 
IS THAT IT PROVIDES US WITH CERTAINTY IN THIS UNCERTAIN AND TEMPORARY SITUATION CALLED LIFE 
THE SNAG IS THAT RELIGION MAKES SOME PEOPLE SO CERTAIN THAT THEY DO TERRIBLE THINGS TO OTHER PEOPLE 
PROBABLY MOST CRUSADERS SET OUT WITH THE INTENTION OF DOING GOOD 
BUT ENDED UP PERPETRATING ONE OF THE GREAT CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY 
AND THE NET RESULT WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY'D SET OUT TO ACHIEVE 
ISLAM FAR FROM BEING DESTROYED LEARNED TO IMITATE EUROPE'S RAGE 
CONSTANTINOPLE FAR FROM BEING SAVED 
NEVER RECOVERED 
TODAY OF COURSE IT IS A TURKISH CITY ISTANBUL 
AND NINE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER IT ALL BEGAN THE WORLD STILL LIVES IN THE LONG SHADOW OF THE CRUSADES 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
