WELL YOU'RE WRONG WHAT DO YOU THINK SERIOUSLY IT MIGHT BE USED FOR 
IN TODAY'S PROGRAMME WE'VE GOT TWO TEAMS OF OLD PROS 
BY THAT I MEAN THEY'VE BEEN IN THE ANTIQUES BUSINESS FOR YEARS 
THEY'RE USED TO BARGAINING AND BARTERING THEIR SKILLS ARE HONED 
THE BIG QUESTIONS IS WHICH OF OUR PROFESSIONAL TEAMS WILL COME OUT TOP THIS COULD GET SERIOUS 
LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING 
THE ARDINGLY INTERNATIONAL DMG ANTIQUES AND COLLECTORS FAIR 
IS BILLED AS BEING THE BIGGEST IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND 
BRIMFUL AND BURSTING WITH BOOTY 
IN FACT AN IDEAL HUNTING GROUND FOR OUR TEAMS TO BAG SOME BARGAINS 
AS ALWAYS THEY ONLY HAVE ONE HOUR AND THREE HUNDRED TO FORAGE FOR FINDS 
WITH THE HELP OF ONE OF OUR VERY OWN EXPERTS 
THE AIM OF THE GAME IS TO TRACK DOWN THREE OUTSTANDING BARGAINS 
THAT'LL MAKE THEM THE MOST MONEY AT AUCTION 
LET'S MEET THE TEAMS WHO'VE TAKEN UP THE CHALLENGE TODAY 
WELL PROFESSIONAL REPUTATIONS ARE ON THE LINE HERE TODAY 
WE HAVE TWO TEAMS OF DEALERS 
THE REDS DIANE AND JACKIE WELCOME 
AND FOR THE BLUES JOHN AND EDDIE 
NOW LADIES FIRST 
DIANE HOW DID YOU FIRST BECOME INTERESTED IN ANTIQUES 
I STARTED AROUND THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN WHEN I COULDN'T AFFORD TO BUY ANYTHING NEW 
SO I WENT TO VARIOUS SHOPS AND BOUGHT ANTIQUES 
AND WHAT SORT OF THINGS DO YOU DEAL WITH SMALL PIECES OF FURNITURE 
BUT I STARTED OFF BUYING WRITING SLOPES AND TEA CADDIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
NOW YOU'VE PROGRESSED YES A BIT 
A LITTLE BIT YES BUT YOU LIKE PRETTY LITTLE THINGS I DO YES ATTRACTIVE USEFUL 
RATHER LIKE YOUR TEAM MATE JACKIE ACTUALLY EXACTLY 
JACKIE HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE BUSINESS TEN YEARS YOU'RE EXPERIENCED THEN ABSOLUTELY 
IT SAYS HERE THAT YOU STARTED GOING TO AUCTIONS AGED ELEVEN 
MY FATHER TOOK ME AS HE USED TO BUY FROM ONE AUCTION AND PUT IT IN ANOTHER AS THEY DID IN THOSE DAYS 
GOSH IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD WELL YOU COULD SAY THAT HAVE ANTIQUES TAKEN OVER YOUR LIFE 
WELL YOU GO ON HOLIDAY AND YOU SAY OOH CAN WE JUST GO IN THERE 
AND SOMETHING CATCHES YOUR EYE AND YOU CAN'T HELP IT ONCE IT STARTS YOU JUST CAN'T STOP IT 
QUITE THAT'S WHAT I'VE RATHER ENJOYED ALL MY LIFE 
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A GREAT TEAM AND WE'LL BE RIVETED TO SEE HOW YOU GET ON 
NOW FOR THE BOYS JOHN AND EDDIE WELCOME 
JOHN BEFORE WE START TALKING ABOUT ANTIQUES BEING ON TELLY IS NOT AN UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE FOR YOU IS IT 
ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO I DID A FILM 
I HAVE TWO VINTAGE CARS AND A FRIEND OF MINE HAS A FLEET OF ABOUT FIFTEEN AND HE PHONED AND ASKED 
WHETHER I'D TAKE ONE OF MY CARS ON A FILM SET WHICH I DID AND AS A RESULT OF THAT 
ONE OF THE CASTING DIRECTORS CAME UP AFTERWARDS AND SAID WOULD I LIKE TO BE A SUPPORTING ARTIST 
OR AN EXTRA AS IT'S COMMONLY KNOWN AND THAT'S HOW IT KICKED OFF 
SO HE THOUGHT GOOD LOOKING CHAP LIKE YOU YOU SHOULD BE DOING A BIT OF THIS THAT'S FANTASTIC 
SO HOW HAVE YOU MOVED ON FROM BEING AN EXTRA OR A SUPPORTING ARTIST I SHOULD SAY TO BEING IN ANTIQUES 
MY SISTER OWNS AN ANTIQUES SHOP IN DORKING WHERE WE ALL TRADE FROM 
OH RIGHT YOU'RE ALL FROM THE SAME AREA OH EVEN MORE COMPETITION WHICH IS LOVELY 
EDDIE YOU'RE FAIRLY NEW TO THE GAME BEING A YOUNGSTER YOURSELF 
SIXTY TIM WHAT 
SIXTY I'VE GOT MY BUS PASS YOU'VE GOT YOUR BUS PASS 
YOU ARE JOKING AREN'T YOU 
YOU'RE AN INCREDIBLY YOUTHFUL SIXTY YEAR OLD 
BUT YOU'RE FOND OF THE OLD ANTIQUES VERY FOND AND HAVE YOU FOUND ANY GOOD BARGAINS RECENTLY 
I LITTLE WHILE AGO I WAS CLEANING OUT THE GARAGE 
AND I FOUND A SUITCASE OF FOOTBALL PROGRAMMES 
I TOOK THEM TO A SPORTS MEMORABILIA AUCTION 
THE ESTIMATE WAS FIVE HUNDRED AND THEY FETCHED THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED 
DID THEY REALLY THAT'S PRETTY GOOD ISN'T IT FIND YOUR SPECIALIST AUCTIONEER THAT'S THE SECRET 
YOU WON'T BE BUYING ANY OF THOSE ON BARGAIN HUNT TODAY WILL YOU I'D LIKE TO 
IF YOU FIND THEM O. K. VERY GOOD LUCK NOW IT'S THE MONEY MOMENT LOOK AT THESE GIRLS PANTING FOR IT 
THERE WE GO THREE HUNDRED IN CASH YOU KNOW THE RULES

WHATEVER'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
WELL THEY WON'T BE LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES 
WE'VE GOT OUR VERY OWN EXPERTS 
KEEPING HIS EYE FOR THE REDS IS DAVID BARBY 
AND HOPING TO LIFT THE WINNING TROPHY FOR THE BLUES 
IS PHILIP SERRELL 
LOOK AT THAT THROUGH THERE LOOK AT THAT CHAIR THAT LOOKS NICE HAVE A LOOK AT THAT 
WHERE'S DAVID DAVID 
COME HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS 
YOU'VE FOUND SOMETHING AT LAST YEAH WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IN YOUR DEALERS' EXPERIENCE HOW OLD IS IT 
NINETEEN TWENTIES YEAH THAT'S MY OPINION AS WELL WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT IT 
EVERYTHING THE DECORATION ON IT IS BEAUTIFUL THE BACK IS ABSOLUTELY SPLENDID 
AND DON'T FORGET BLACK'S IN VOGUE AT THE MOMENT 
I DO LIKE IT 
IT'S A LOVELY SHAPE IT'S VERY MUCH IN THE REGENCY MODE ABSOLUTELY 
IT'S NOT BRAND NEW YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE OF THE WEAR ON THE ARMS 
YOU CAN IMAGINE SOMEBODY SITTING THERE RUBBING THEIR HANDS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS 
THE ONLY THING THAT CONCERNS ME SOMEWHAT IS THE DIFFERENT COLOURS HERE 
YOU'VE GOT THIS AREA WHICH IS THE ORIGINAL AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS RECANING 
YEAH ARE THERE ANY DEALER'S TRICKS TO GET THE SAME COLOUR TO THE BACK 
AND THE SEAT BECAUSE THIS WOULD THROW ME SLIGHTLY 
WELL POSSIBLY TEA DAVID COLD TEA OR HOT TEA I'M NOT TOO SURE 
BUT POSSIBLY THAT MIGHT BE THE ANSWER I KNOW THEY DO IT ON PAPER THEY DO IT ON CANEWORK AS WELL 
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE YOU HAD A GOOD LOOK AT IT YES WE HAVE 
THERE IS A LITTLE LABEL AT THE BOTTOM DAVID WHAT DOES IT SAY 
MADE IN ENGLAND IT'S PLASTIC 
WE'LL GO FOR THAT I LIKE THIS CANING HERE 
IT'S BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY WELL DONE 
IT HAS ABSOLUTELY HOW MUCH IS IT 
SHE'S ASKING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SO WE'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT TO GET IT DOWN 
IF IT WAS IN YOUR SHOP WOULD IT SELL 
ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM 
THE AREA I COME FROM THESE CHAIRS COME UP FOR SALE THEY NEVER MAKE THAT SORT OF PRICE RANGE 
SO I HAVE MY RESERVATIONS O. K. I HAVE MY RESERVATIONS 
BUT YOU BOTH LIKE IT YEAH YOU BOTH WANT TO BUY IT YES YOU'VE GOT TO NEGOTIATE 
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE IT A GOOD GO 
THE DEALER'S OVER THERE HAVE A WORD WE'LL SEE YOU LATER 
BEST OF LUCK THANK YOU 
WELL THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE ASKING PRICE FOR THE CHAIR SITTING DOWN 
THEY TRIMMED OFF FIFTY QUID PAYING A COMFORTABLE ONE HUNDRED 
PHILIP WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS 
HAS HE GOT A NAME 
NERO HOW ABOUT BARBY DON'T YOU THINK HE LOOKS LIKE HIM OR WETHERBY 
RUGGED THAT'S ONE ADJECTIVE THAT DOESN'T SPRING TO MIND 
I THINK HE AND I HAVE GOT A LOT IN COMMON IN THAT WE BOTH LOOK ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
BUT WE HAVEN'T GOT MUCH AGE HE'S QUITE HEAVY 
YOU GUYS THE JOYS OF ACTUALLY DOING BARGAIN HUNTING 
ALL THE PRESSURE'S OFF ME 
I'VE JUST GOT TO STAND HERE AND WALK ROUND WITH YOU 
AND LET YOU BUY PROFITS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU DO DAY IN DAY OUT WE DO 
I LIKE IT I'M GOING TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS NOW 
HOW MUCH IS THIS THIRTY 
RIGHT WHAT'S THE DEALER TOLD YOU YOU CAN BUY IT FOR FIFTEEN SO IT'S FIFTEEN QUID THAT'S FOR NOTHING 
CAN'T BUY ANYTHING CAN YOU THAT SMELLS LIKE A PROFIT TO ME 
THERE IS NO AGE TO IT IS THERE NONE WHATSOEVER IT LOOKS OLD IT'S BEEN AGED HOW DO WE DO THAT THEN 
YOGHURT LEFT OUT FOR A LONG TIME IN THE GARDEN COW MUCK'S ANOTHER ONE 
YOU POUR COW MUCK ALL OVER SOMETHING AND BURY IT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND IT ANTIQUES IT 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LET PEOPLE AT HOME KNOW THERE'S NO INTENTION TO DECEIVE IN ANY WAY NO 
WE CALL IT AFTER THE ANTIQUE YEAH THAT'S RIGHT AND HE'S ASKED FOR FIFTEEN QUID WHICH IS ANOTHER CLUE 
AND IT'S JUST A DECORATIVE THING THE MAIN THING HIS NOSE IS INTACT 
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN HE'S LOST THE ARMS THOUGH 
ARMLESS THERE'S ONE OTHER QUESTION ON THIS PROGRAMME THOUGH 
IS THERE A PROFIT IN IT I THINK THERE IS 
I'M GOING TO FIND US TWO BITS OF WOOD YOU CAN BRING BARBY ALONG GOOD LUCK 
OH THAT PHILIP HE IS SO CHEEKY 
THE BLUES USED THEIR HEADS AND PAID FIFTEEN FOR THE TERRACOTTA BUST 
WHICH ONE OF YOU TWO CHERUBS CHOSE THIS DIANE 
I SAW IT FIRST AND I LOVE OAK 
AND THIS IS A REALLY NICE COUNTRY PIECE RIGHT 
NICE OAK ORIGINAL HANDLES VERY USEFUL BECAUSE YOU CAN POP YOUR BOX OF THINGS IN HERE 
A LAMP A TELEPHONE SOME HIDDEN BITS AND BOBS IN HERE AND I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL 
I LIKE THE RIM SO NOTHING ON THE TOP IS GOING TO FALL OFF 
WHAT WOULD IT HAVE BEEN USED FOR ORIGINALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED POSSIBLY BY THE BED 
THE CUPBOARD MAY HAVE HAD A CHAMBER POT IN 
AND JUST FOR KEEPING PERSONAL PIECES IN 
INVARIABLY THESE PIECES WHICH DATE FROM MID GEORGIAN PERIOD 
TO THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THEY'VE BEEN ALTERED 
YES I THINK IT'S BEEN CUT DOWN BUT THERE AGAIN IT'S BEEN CUT DOWN TO THE SIDE OF A SOFA 
SO I THINK THAT'S QUITE A NICE IDEA YOUR IDEA OF A LAMP AND BOOKS INSIDE IT BRILLIANT 
BUT I HEARD YOU OPEN IT AND IT GOES CLICK YEAH 
IT'S GOT THAT BALL SECTION THERE YEAH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DRAWER OUT SECTION WITH A PEWTER 
OR A CERAMIC LINER O. K. 
I STILL LIKE IT DAVID 
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S VERY USEFUL 
YOU'RE THE RUSTIC LOVER THANK YOU 
JACKIE YOU'RE THE SOPHISTICATED TOWN DWELLER THANK YOU DAVID 
CAN YOU SEE THIS SELLING IN YOUR SHOP WELL YES IT WOULD SELL IN THE SHOP 
IT'S GOT A FEW PROBLEMS AS YOU KNOW PIECES MISSING HERE 
AND IT'S GOT THIS WHICH ISN'T RIGHT SO THIS WOULD SELL 
BUT IT'S A SALEABLE THING BUT NOT AT A GREAT PRICE HOW MUCH 
I THINK I DON'T KNOW DIANE YOU KNOW OAK WHAT WOULD YOU SAY 
POSSIBLY IN THE SHOP I WOULD PUT A PRICE TICKET OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE 
WHAT SORT OF PRICE ARE THEY ASKING 
IT'S ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY YEAH SO THERE'S ROOM TO NEGOTIATE 
WELL I'D OBVIOUSLY LIKE TO BUY IT CHEAPER THAN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY 
O. K. BUT I THINK IT'S A FAIR PRICE I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO NEGOTIATE QUITE HEAVILY ON THIS ONE YEAH 
WELL IF WE DON'T GET IT DOWN WE JUST WON'T BUY IT 
THAT'S A VERY GOOD COMMENT BEST OF LUCK THANK YOU 
SHE'S A FEISTY ONE THAT JACKIE 
THEY DID AGREE A PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED LEAVING ONLY ONE MORE ITEM FOR THE REDS TO FIND 
YOU READY FOR A BIT OF MYSTERY AND SUSPENSE NO MURDER THOUGH 
TELL ME WHAT THIS THING IS 
HOW ABOUT THAT 
GO ON THEN YOU'RE ALL SHOUTING AWAY AT HOME 
IT'S QUITE OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT WARMS UP YOUR SHOE 
WELL YOU'RE WRONG WHAT DO YOU THINK SERIOUSLY IT MIGHT BE USED FOR 
THIS IS PLANISHED COPPER 
THAT'S BEEN HAMMERED OUT LITERALLY OVER A SHAPE 
AND YOU CAN SEE ALL THE HAMMER MARKS THERE AND THEN SEAMED TOGETHER 
SOMEBODY'S TAKEN A LOT OF TROUBLE TO DO THIS 
IT'S ALSO GOT THIS INSULATED HANDLE 
IF THIS WAS FILLED WITH A HOT MATERIAL 
THAT BAND OF COPPER AROUND THE OUTSIDE WOULD GET EXTREMELY HOT 
EXCEPT THEY'VE FILLED IN THAT BAND OF COPPER 
WITH THAT LITTLE BIT WHICH WOULD HELP TO DISSIPATE THE HEAT 
AND ENABLE YOU TO HOLD IT MORE COMFORTABLY 
ANYWAY IT'S NOT FOR WARMING UP SHOES ALTHOUGH IT IS CALLED A SLIPPER 
THIS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IS A COPPER BEER SLIPPER 
IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE TO A PUB AND HAD YOUR ALE 
WHICH WOULD NOT BE LIKE THE BEER THAT WE HAVE TODAY BUT STRONG STUFF 
SOMETHING LIKE A LITTLE BARLEY WINE SOMETHING THAT HAS A PROOF OF ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN PER CENT 
AND YOU'D HAVE PUT THAT STRONG BEER INTO A VESSEL LIKE THIS AND SHOVE THE WHOLE THING 
INTO THE EMBERS OF A LOG FIRE AND THE EMBERS WOULD WARM UP THE STRONG BEER 
YOU'D POUR IT OUT AND HAVE A GLASS HOW ABOUT THAT 
IT'S A BEER WARMER ISN'T THAT EXTRAORDINARY 
WELL IF YOU LOVE IT AS AN OBJECT AND YOU LIKE DRINKING BEER 
YOU MIGHT LIKE TO OWN IT AND IT COULD BE YOURS FOR SIXTY 
AT THREE A PINT TODAY THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY PINTS OF BEER 
WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE TWENTY PINTS OF BEER OR ONE OF THESE CHAPPIES 
ANYWAY IT'S A GOOD FUN OBJECT 
DOWN UNDER THEY SAY MAKE MINE A COLD ONE 
BACK HERE IN THE MOTHER COUNTRY AT LEAST IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WE'D HAVE SAID MAKE MINE A HOT ONE 
HEY GUYS LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND OH YEAH THAT'S NICE EDDIE 
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS DON'T YOU MAUCHLINWARE OF COURSE YOU KNOW MAUCHLINWARE 
MAUCHLINE M. A U. C. H. L. I N. E. THAT'S THE ONE YEAH MAUCHLINWARE MADE IN SCOTLAND YEP 
TRANSFER PRINTED TURN OF THE CENTURY 
WHAT DOES THAT SAY VALE OF KESWICK THAT'S A NICE LITTLE THING 
IT'S YOU KNOW PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN BOUGHT AS A SOUVENIR 
FIFTEEN YOU'VE SNIFFED ONE OUT THERE HAVEN'T YOU WELL I THINK IT'S 
AGAIN NOT A LOT OF MONEY BUT THEY'RE COLLECTIBLE 
WHO'S GONNA BUY THAT OFF YOU COLLECTORS OF MAUCHLINWARE 
THERE'S AN ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING AND YOU HIT IT ON THE NAIL YOU'RE RIGHT 
IT'S FOR NO MONEY 
SO BASICALLY WE'VE GOT A LITTLE WOODEN TRINKET HERE AND ITS SOLE MEANS OF DECORATION 
IS THIS PURELY SCOTTISH TECHNIQUE OF PUTTING A TRANSFER PRINT OF A VIEW ON THERE 
THIS IS REALLY OUR EDWARDIAN STICK OF ROCK ISN'T IT 
YOU WENT AWAY ON HOLIDAY AND YOU BOUGHT A LITTLE TRINKET OR SOMETHING TO TAKE HOME 
AND IT'S THIS LITTLE BIT OF WOOD WITH A VIEW OF WHERE YOU SPENT YOUR HOLIDAY 
AND THIS MAUCHLINWARE WASN'T JUST FOR SCOTTISH USE 
YOU SEE THEM YOU KNOW 
ALL VARIOUS SEASIDE RESORTS AND THERE'S A BIG COLLECTING AREA FOR THIS ISN'T THERE 
THERE IS YES 
BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF MAUCHLINE COLLECTORS 
I MEAN IT FALLS UNDER THAT GENERIC TERM OF TREEN 
AND TREEN IS OF THE TREE IT'S ACTUALLY A PIECE OF TURNED WOOD 
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED ON A LATHE 
AND IT'S FIFTEEN QUID M. M. M. H. M. M. BARGAIN 
BARGAIN ON THAT NOTE YOU GO AND PAY THE MAN WE'LL GO AND FIND OUR NEXT BIDS ALL RIGHT 
YOU THINK THIS BARGAIN HUNT LARK LOOKS EASY RIGHT 
JUST LIKE DRIVING DOWN A MOTORWAY 
BUT IT ISN'T BUT IF YOU WANNA BE ON THE PROGRAMME ANYWAY THEN DROP US A LINE 
GOOD LUCK NOW WHERE'S THE INSURANCE PAPERS 
JOHN DO YOU GET MANY OF THESE IN YOUR SHOP NO I THINK THESE ARE VERY RARE I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS IT'S A PILL MAKER ISN'T IT 
YOU WOULD GO TO YOUR LOCAL CHEMIST WITH A PRESCRIPTION FROM YOUR DOCTOR 
FOR A LOTION OR A POTION OR SOME PILLS AND HE'D NIP OUT THE BACK AND MAKE YOUR PILL UP FOR YOU 
IT ROLLS THIS SORT OF PASTE OUT INTO A LONG CYLINDER OR TUBE THAT COULD THEN BE CHOPPED UP INTO TABLET FORM 
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS ONE IF YOU JUST PUSH THAT DOWN AND THAT DOWN 
THIS ACTUALLY SLIDES OUT AND YOU CAN SEE THERE THAT IT'S REVERSIBLE HOW OLD IS IT PHIL 
I WOULD THINK IT'S PROBABLY MID NINETEENTH CENTURY IT'S VERY WELL MADE IT'S A NICE PIECE OF MAHOGANY 
IT'S A NICE TALKING POINT IF YOU HAD A DINNER PARTY 
WHAT SORT OF DINNER PARTIES DO YOU HAVE PILLS AND LOTIONS AND 
I'M NOT SURE I'M GONNA GO THERE BUT YOU THINK IT'S INTERESTING I DO YES 
NOT HAVING SEEN ONE BEFORE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WOULD HAVE SOLD QUITE WELL YEAH 
HOW MUCH IS IT PHIL IT'S PRICED UP AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
WHAT WOULD THIS BE IN YOUR CENTRE HOW MUCH 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
YEAH SO WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT TO PAY FOR THIS IN AN AUCTION 
NOTHING UNDER ONE HUNDRED 
SO IF I CAN GO AND GET IT OFF THE DEALER 
FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN NINETY QUID THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A RESULT 
YES YOU GO AND DO THE DEAL AND I'LL GO AND GET THE COFFEES IN 
WELL DONE PHILIP HE POPPED THE PILL MAKER IN FOR EIGHTY LARGE ONES 
WHAT ON EARTH DID YOU BUY THIS FOR LOOK AT IT 
OH DAVID PLEASE DON'T DAVID THE REASON WE'VE BOUGHT THIS IS LOOK IT'S PAINTED 
PAINTING'S IN VOGUE WE'RE COLD AND IT'S POURING WITH RAIN

AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT IT'S TERRIBLE HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY 
WELL TWENTY 
NO NO UP 
UP UP UP MORE MORE 
NINETY NINETY YEAH 
WE ONLY PAID FIFTY I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TWENTY 
OH DAVID I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE REALLY COULD YOU BUY US ANOTHER ONE FOR TWENTY DAVID 
I WOULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT REALLY 
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU WHO'S GONNA BUY THIS AT AUCTION PAINTED FURNITURE IS NOW IN 
IT'S IN ALL THE MAGAZINES THE POSH MAGAZINES AND I KNOW IT SELLS 
SO WE DECIDED WHY NOT 
REALLY PAINTED STUFF YEAH WHAT PUT FLOWERS ALL THE WAY AROUND IT OR WHAT 
NO YOU COULD PUT LIGHTS ROUND IT COULDN'T YOU IT'S GETTING WORSE 
BEING HONEST WE ARE NOT ENAMOURED WITH IT BUT WE JUST THOUGHT 
AND YOU'VE BOUGHT IT WELL WE KNOW PEOPLE BUY THIS STUFF 
FIFTY YEAH 
YEAH AND YOU'RE GOING TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO PAY FIFTY PLUS 
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO WANT IT HOPEFULLY I THINK IT'S HIDEOUS IT GOES ON YOUR HEAD O. K. 
OH BYE I THINK HE'S RIGHT ACTUALLY YEAH I DO BLESS HIM 
YES TIME'S UP O. K. FINE 
TIME'S UP THE SHOPPING'S OVER 
LET'S RECAP ON WHAT THE REDS BOUGHT 
THE REDS RECLINED INTO PARTING WITH ONE HUNDRED FOR THE REGENCY ARMCHAIR 
THEY BRANCHED OUT ANOTHER TON FOR THE OAK TRAY TOP NIGHT TABLE 
AND FINALLY HAVE THEY PAINTED THEMSELVES INTO A CORNER 
WITH THE WHITE CHEVAL MIRROR THAT DAVID HATED 
GOSH YOU HAD FUN THERE WE DID DID YOU ENJOY YOUR SHOPPING ABSOLUTELY SUPER TWO PROS 
YEAH EXCEPT FOR THE WEATHER WHICH IS YOUR FAVOURITE PIECE 
I THINK THE CHAIR THE CHAIR IS YOUR FAVOURITE YEAH 
AND JACKIE WHICH PIECE IS GONNA BRING THE BIGGEST PROFIT 
WELL I HOPE IT'S THE CHAIR COS I LIKE IT 
WELL YOU SPENT A MONSTER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WHICH IS VERY GOOD 
I'D LIKE FIFTY OF LEFTOVER LOLLY TO GIVE TO DAVID THANK YOU 
MAESTRO WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THAT FIND SOMETHING EXOTIC EXOTIC WELL I HOPE SO 
EXOTIC OR EROTIC OOH GOOD IDEA TIM THANK YOU 
ALWAYS LIKE TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF A TIP DAVID NOW LET'S RECAP ON WHAT THE BLUES BOUGHT 
THE BLUES TOOK THE CHALLENGE HEAD ON 
AND PAID FIFTEEN FOR THE YOGHURT FLAVOURED TERRACOTTA BUST 
THE MAUCHLINWARE POT WASN'T ANY MORE EXPENSIVE 
BUT WILL IT CHURN IN ANY MORE PROFIT 
FINALLY COULD THE TABLET ROLLER ROTATE A HEALTHY PROFIT AT AUCTION 
OR COULD IT BE A BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW 
JOHN AND ED DID YOU HAVE A GOOD SHOP YES YEAH WE DID WHICH IS YOUR FAVOURITE ITEM 
I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING IS THE PILL ROLLER THAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE 
IS THAT YOUR FAVOURITE TOO ED ME TOO YES YEAH OKAY 
THE BIG QUESTION IS IS IT GOING TO BE A HIGH ROLLER NO I THINK THE BUST 
THE BARBIE THE BARBIE THE BARBIE THE BARBIE BUST SO THAT IS GOING TO BRING THE BIGGEST PROFIT 
I THINK SO WELL YOU ONLY SPENT A MISERABLE ONE HUNDRED TEN SO ONE HUNDRED NINETY WORTH OF LEFTOVER LOLLY GOES TO P. SERRELL 
I SHALL TRY AND BE EQUALLY MISERABLE 
OH NO YOU'VE GOT TO GO AND SPEND THE LOT GO ON WODGE IT OUT 
NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT NO I'M FROM WORCESTERSHIRE I CAN'T DO THAT 
THAT'S TRUE 
ANYWAY FOR ME I'M HEADING OFF SOMEWHERE DUCAL THAT MEANS GRAND 
SITTING REGALLY AT THE HEART OF A TWELVE THOUSAND ACRE ESTATE NEAR CHICHESTER WEST SUSSEX 
YOU'LL FIND THE FLINTED TURRETED AND BEAUTIFUL GOODWOOD HOUSE 
HOME TO THE DUKES OF RICHMOND FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS 
THIS REMARKABLE HOUSE WAS EXTENDED BETWEEN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIX 
EFFECTIVELY ADDING ON TWO WINGS AND CREATING THE ELEVATION WHICH WE ENJOY TODAY 
AND WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF ALL THIS BUILDING WORK 
WELL THE THIRD DUKE WANTED A SPACE THAT WAS SUITABLE 
FOR THE DISPLAY OF HIS MAGNIFICENT COLLECTION OF PAINTINGS 
FURNITURE AND CERAMICS A LOT OF WHICH HAD BEEN MERCIFULLY SAVED 
WHEN HIS LONDON HOME RICHMOND HOUSE WAS TOTALLY CONSUMED BY FIRE IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY ONE 
FROM THE ASHES OF RICHMOND HOUSE GOODWOOD AROSE LIKE A PHOENIX 
AND BECAME MUCH GRANDER EFFECTIVELY BECOMING A NEW HOUSE 
SO WHAT DRAWS ME TO THIS ONE OF THE SMALLER ROOMS AT GOODWOOD 
WHEN THERE ARE A PLETHORA OF ENORMOUS SPACES CRAMMED WITH TREASURES HERE 
WELL AS THEY SAY SIZE ISN'T EVERYTHING 
AND THIS ROOM WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE CARD ROOM IS ACTUALLY FITTED UP 
AS A PURPOSE BUILT VITRINE TO HOUSE AN EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION OF PORCELAINS 
NOT JUST ORDINARY PORCELAIN THOUGH BUT SEVRE FROM THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
MOST ENGLISH COUNTRY HOUSES THAT YOU VISIT HAVE COLLECTIONS OF SEVRE PORCELAIN 
YOU COULD HAVE OBTAINED EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SEVRE SAY EARLY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
AFTER THE REVOLUTION BY THE WHEELBARROW FULL 
WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THESE GOODWOOD PIECES IS THAT THE THIRD DUKE 
ACTUALLY WENT TO FRANCE IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE AND COMMISSIONED HIS OWN ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE PIECE SERVICE 
ONE OF THE GREAT ADVANTAGES OF COMMISSIONING AN OBJECT 
IS THAT YOU HAVE THE CHOICE AS TO HOW IT MIGHT BE DECORATED 
THE THIRD DUKE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN NATURAL HISTORY 
AND IT WASN'T SURPRISING THAT HE TOOK ILLUSTRATED VOLUMES OF BIRDS WITH HIM 
TO HAVE REPRODUCED ON THE PORCELAIN IN THIS CASE 
GEORGE EDWARDS' BOOK OF DIVERSE BIRDS FROM THE WORLD 
AND THAT IS WHAT WE SEE HER 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESERVE YOU CAN SEE 
THAT HERE IS THE TURKEY VULTURE IN EDWARDS' BOOK 
AND HERE IS THE TURKEY VULTURE AS PAINTED BY THE SEVRE DECORATOR 
AND AREN'T THEY WONDERFULLY CLOSE 
THE ONLY OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN THE BACKGROUND 
ON THE PIECE OF PORCELAIN WE HAVE A REPRESENTATION OF STONEHENGE 
NOW HOW WACKY IS THAT 
AND I LIKE TO THINK THAT PERHAPS THE THIRD DUKE WHEN DISCUSSING THE DECORATION 
WITH THE FRENCH DECORATOR SAID I'D LIKE A BIT OF STONEHENGE BEHIND MY TURKEY VULTURE 
WHAT COULD BE NICER THAN THAT 
BUT THIS COLLECTION IS ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE LEGACY OF THE THIRD DUKE 
I WONDER EXACTLY WHAT SORT OF LEGACY OUR TEAMS ARE GOING TO BE LEAVING US TODAY OVER AT THE AUCTION 
IT IS GREAT TO BE AT BELLMANS SALEROOM IN WEST SUSSEX 
WITH OUR AUCTIONEER JONATHAN PRATT HI JONATHAN

URM WELL I THINK SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY TO EIGHTY 
HOW MUCH FIFTY TO EIGHTY NEVER 
FIFTEEN IS ALL THEY PAID FOR OLD MUSSOLINI HERE MARVELLOUS 
NOW THE LAST ITEM HOWEVER ISN'T GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN 
IT'S A PILL ROLLER 
MM HMM YOU KNOW TO ME ONE OF THE MOST USELESS THINGS 
YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE BUYING 
IF YOU WANT TO SET UP A DRUG DEN AND ROLL YOUR OWN PILLS 
FANTASTIC IT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH MORE OF A USE THAN THAT 
IT TELLS A STORY A BIT OF HISTORY WHICH IS LOVELY 
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU ESTIMATE 
THEY STILL SELL FOR BETWEEN FORTY TO SIXTY 
DO THEY THAT WOULD BE MARVELLOUS THEY PAID EIGHTY 
REALISTICALLY FORTY TO SIXTY YOU'RE A VERY BRAVE MAN 
OVERALL THEY'LL PROBABLY NEED THEIR BONUS BUY SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
O. K. YOU SPENT ONE HUNDRED TEN MISERABLE 
YOU GAVE PHILIP ONE HUNDRED NINETY 
WHAT DID HE SPEND IT ON 
I DIDN'T SPEND ALL OF IT TIM 
DIDN'T YOU NO SURPRISE SURPRISE AHH ISN'T THAT LOVELY 
I RATHER LIKE THESE MATCHBOX COVERS EDWARDIAN 
I'D GUESS SO A GREAT HALLMARK 
GOLDSMITHS AND SILVERSMITHS COMPANY 
BEING INITIALLED DOES THAT DEVALUE IT 
IF YOUR NAME IS JOHN DAVIS IT WON'T 
IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT WASN'T BUT IF YOU WENT TO A MODERN JEWELLERS 
OR MODERN SHOP TO BUY SOMETHING LIKE THAT MY GUESS IS THAT WOULD COST BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED 
I BOUGHT THAT FOR TWENTY FOUR 
WHAT DO YOU ESTIMATE IT'LL FETCH 
BETWEEN THIRTY AND FIFTY I'M SURE IT WILL 
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT YOU HAVE A BOX OF MATCHES 
KITCHEN TYPE MATCHES KNOCKING ABOUT THAT'S AN UGLY THING 
IT'S NOT A BEAUTIFUL THING 
GET THE RIGHT SIZE MATCHBOX TO FIT INSIDE THE LOVELY CASE 
IT'S IN YOUR DRAWING ROOM THE DINING ROOM LIGHTING CANDLES OR THE FIRE 
THE ONE DRAWBACK WITH IT WILL BE FINDING A BOX OF MATCHES THE RIGHT SIZE TO FIT IT O. K. BOYS 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE BUT WE THINK THERE'S POTENTIAL THERE 
YOU'LL DECIDE AFTER THE SALE OF THE FIRST THREE ITEMS 
BUT NOW SEE WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT IT 
COR STRIKE A LIGHT WHAT YOU THINK 
YES NICE QUALITY MATCHBOX COVER 
ENGINE TURNED BANDS LITTLE CIRCULAR CARTOUCHE IN THE MIDDLE WHICH HAS INITIALS 
HANG ON YOU'RE J. P. AREN'T YOU

OR I COULD CHANGE MY NAME BY DEED POLL 
MAYBE NOT A NICE WEIGHT IT'S GOOD QUALITY IT'S NOT POLISHED OUT 
IT'S RATHER CRISP 
GOLDSMITHS AND SILVERSMITHS COMPANY NINETEEN OH EIGHT LONDON DECENT MAKER 
I'D HAVE THOUGHT AN EASY SALE AT TWENTY TO THIRTY 
AN EASY SALE HE PAID TWENTY FOUR FOR IT THE CUNNING OLD FOX 
IT MIGHT MAKE THIRTY IT MIGHT IT MIGHT IGNITE SOME INTEREST

ROBERT PELHAM STARTED THE FIRM IN MARLBOROUGH IN WILTSHIRE IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN 
HE WAS CHARITABLY MOTIVATED BECAUSE HE WANTED A BUSINESS 
THAT WOULD PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT FOR EX SERVICE PERSONNEL 
HE WAS INCREDIBLY KEEN ON USING REDUNDANT BITS OF MATERIAL 
IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT HE WENT TO A FAIRGROUND AND WAS LOOKING AT THE COCONUT SHY 
HE WATCHED THESE CHAPS AND THOUGHT I WONDER WHERE THEY GET THEIR BALLS FROM 
IF YOU LOOK AT HER HEAD HER HEAD IS CIRCULAR 
BECAUSE ORIGINALLY PELHAM PUPPETS ALL HAD HEADS 
MADE OUT OF THOSE HARD WOODEN BALLS WE USED FOR KNOCKING OFF COCONUTS
