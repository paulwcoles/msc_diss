NESTLED BETWEEN EIGHT VOLCANOS THE 
FRENCH TOWN OF CLERMONT FERRAND IS 
HOME TO MICHELIN TYRE BUT FOR THE 
NEXT FOUR DAYS IT IS HOSTING A 
COMPETITION THAT IS TIRING FOR A 
DIFFERENT REASON THE EUROPEAN 
WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS CHAMPIONSHIP 
WITH QUALIFICATION FOR BEIJING 
ALREADY SECURED AT LAST YEAR'S 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS THIS 
COMPETITION GIVES EVERYONE A CHANCE 
TO SEE HOW THE PREPARATIONS ARE 
GOING FOR ALL THE EUROPEAN TEAMS 
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR US HOW 
THINGS ARE GOING FOR OUR BRITISH 
GIRLS GIRLS IT IS NOW OVER SIX MONTHS SINCE OUR 
WOMEN'S TEAM QUALIFIED FOR THE 
OLYMPICS IT WAS A STUNNING RESULT 
IN STUTTGART IT MEANS A TEAM OF 
SIX GYM NASTS WILL BE ON THEIR WAY 
TO BEIJING IN AUFPLGT QUALIFYING 
FOR THE OLYMPICS IS ONE THING 
COMPETING ON THE WORLD STAGE IS 
ANOTHER THING 
YOU DID SUPERBLY AT THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS TO QUALIFY WHAT HAS 
BEEN HAPPENING WITHIN YOUR OWN 
PREPARATIONS 
A LOT OF HARD WORK PREPARATIONS WE HAVE BEEN COMING TOGETHER A LOT 
TO GET THE TEAM BONDED AND GET 
ROUTINES READY COACHES ARE KEEPING 
CHECKS ON THE ROUTINES AND SAYING 
WHETHER WE ARE ALLOWED TO DO 
CERTAIN SKILLS WE WANT TO GO OUT 
WITH 
THE BEST 
CHANCE WE CAN AND SEE 
WHAT CAN HAPPEN OUT HERE 
BETH HAS 
A BRAND NEW BAR ROUTINE SHE WAS 
DOING IT FOR 
HERSELF TO 
TRIAL WILL 
IT WORK WILL IT NOT WILL SHE NEED 
TO CHANGE IT SHE SCORED A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE SO 
THAT BODES WELL FOR HER FINAL HERE 
IF SHE CAN POLISH THAT AND ADD ONE 
MORE SKILL MAYBE THE OLYMPIC TITLE 
IS THERE 
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE I 
WOULD LOVE TO COME HOME WITH AN 
OLYMPIC MEDAL THAT IS THE ONLY ONE 
NOT IN THE COLLECTION L. HAVE DONE 
MORE THAN I EVER THOUGHT I WOULD DO 
IN GYNASTICS IF I CAN GO OUT WITH 
A NEW ROUTINE DO IT THE BEST I CAN 
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS I WILL BE 
REALLY PLEASED WITH THAT 
BETH IS 
OUR BEST CHANCE FOR A MEDAL BUT 
THEY GO AS A 
TEAM THEY 
ARE 
BEGINNING TO BOND WELL AND WORK 
TOGETHER WE 
HAVE ALL 
COME TOGETHER 
TOGETHER WE HAVE A SIMILAR TEAM TO THE WORLD 
FOR THE EUROPEANS WE HAVE GOT TO 
KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER WE HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO ADJUST THE ROUTINES 
HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE EVEN BETTER 
WHEN WE GO TO THE OLYMPICS 
WHAT DO 
YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE AT THE 
OLYMPICS 
IF WE HIT 
THE ROUTINES OLYMPICS THE BEST ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE 
THAT ANYTHING WOULD BE GO ON WHAT

THE OTHER 
TEAMS ARE

A RELATIVELY EASY SECOND VAULT BUT 
AS YOU SAID THE NAME OF THE GAME IS 
TO LAND ON YOUR FEET 
HERE IS THE CURRENT EUROPEAN 
CHAMPION FROM ITALY DOUBLE TWIST A BIT DEEP THAT 
LANDING BUT SHE JUST FLOATED AND

STRUGGLE TO GET IT ROUND NOT THE 
SAME CLASS 
SHE'S IN SILVER MEDAL POSITION AT 
THE MOMENT WHAT A LANDING SUPERB HAND SPRING 
DREAMS ARE MADE OF THAT

BASICALLY WE WENT HOME AFTER THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS AND I WAS A BIT 
BORED I SAID TO AMANDA CAN WE

IN THE VASE FINAL 
IT'S GREAT IT 
JUST SHOWS THAT GREAT BRITAIN ARE 
COMING THROUGH THE RANKS IT'S NOT

ABLE TO PRODUCE SOME RESULTS AS 
WELL BECKY HAS WORKED REALLY HARD 
TO GET WHERE SHE WAS TO HAVE A 
COMPANION OF THERE IS ALWAYS NICE 
IT GIVES YOU A BIT MORE CONFIDENCE THIS IS THE FIRST OF TWO FINALS FOR 
BETH TWEDDLE SHE WAS THE HIGHEST 
QUALIFIER BUT THE CURRENT WORLD

DISAPPOINTING FOR ME IN DISMOUNT THE BOLD FINAL BUT UNBELIEVABLE 
CONFIDENCE FOR HER TO COME OUT AND 
DO THAT SHE SWINGS 
HAS A FABULOUS FEEL ON THE BAR HER 
COACH HAS COACHED HER FROM WHEN SHE 
WAS A LITTLE GIRL SHE IS VERY VERY GOOD AT FIRST 
COMBINATION OF FIFTEEN TURNED STRAIGHT 
INTO THE NEXT MOVE IS INCREDIBLY 
DIFFICULT TO HIT THE FIFTEEN PER WEB 
WITH ENOUGH CONTROL SHE FINDS A 
HANDSTAND VERY WELL SHE 
UNDERSTANDS HER SHAKE ON BARS SHE 
SWINGS THAT LOVELY STRAIGHT ARMS 
THE FIRST BIG CATCH UP AND THEN SHE 
GETS HER FEET RIGHT BACK SHE IS IN SECOND AT 
THE MOMENT VERY BIG START A VERY SLIGHT GYMNAST VERY SOPORE THE WAY SHE GETS THOSE LEGS RIGHT ONTO THE FACE SOPORE WHEN IT LOOKS A BIT LIKE STRENGTH 
RATHER THAN IT SWING IS WHEN THE 
JUDGES GET THEIR PENS OUT AND START 
DEDUCTING SHE IS RECOVERING A VERY 
WELL LINKING TOGETHER LOTS OF 
DIFFICULTY A VERY UNUSUAL DISBAND 
DISMOUNT 
LOVELY LINES AS WELL 
THOSE LONG LIMBS SHE MISSED ONE HANDSTAND AT ONE 
STAGE BUT GOOD COMBINATION HAD TO 
FIGHT HARD ON ONE OCCASION THERE 
IT IS ON THE ENDO SHE STRADDLED A 
HANDSTAND LOVELY TECHNIQUE FOULDS 
DEEPLY LOCKS OUT THROUGH THE 
SHOULDERS AND THERE IS THE DISMOUNT THE CURRENT EUROPEAN CHAMPION IS UP AND ON TO THE BARS NICELY ROUND AND THE PAIR ARE WET 
A LITTLE BIT SCRAPPY IN THE PIKE 
JAEGER IN THE PAIR ARE WET NANTES IN COMPLETE CONTROL BUT DID 
WELL ON THE DISMOUNT AND THERE WAS 
SOME GOOD WORK THERE BUT SHE DID 
STRUGGLE ON OCCASION SHE IS A TALL 
GYMNAST AND JUST SOMETIMES WHEN 
SHE CAUGHT HERE THERE WAS BENT 
ARMS SHE HAD TO GET HERSELF GOING 
AGAIN BUT SHE HAS NOT SOME VERY 
COMPLEX WORK THAT WAS QUITE 
UNUSUAL AND QUITE DIFFICULT SHE 
LIFTS THIS DISMOUNT AND FINISHED 
ABOVE THE BAR THAT'S HOW TO LAND THAT IS THE SCORE FOR BETH TWEDDLE TO BEAT SHE 
HAS BEEN EUROPEAN CHAMPION 
SHE HAS BEEN WORLD CHAMPION WHAT CAN SHE DO HERE 
A NEW BAR ROUTINE 
IT'S A BIT UNSURE COMING INTO THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIPS WHETHER TO USE IT 
BUT SHE HAS GONE FOR BROKE 
BEAUTIFUL SWING TO START TWO BIG 
RELEASES COMING UP NOW 
THE BIG NEW SKILL THE HALF 
TERM IN TO BACK STRETTLE HAS TO 
USE AN EXIT BUT COVERED IT VERY 
WELL THE PROBLEM IS WILL SHE HAVE 
BEEN A ALLAH ENERGY FOR THIS LAST 
ELEMENT WELL DONE 
WHAT A RECOVERY 
SHE HAD A LITTLE GIGGLE TO HERSELF 
THERE ON THE WAY OUT GOODNESS ME TRANSFERRED TO THE LOWER PART NO PROBLEM AT THAT STAGE THERE IS THE TURN IMMEDIATE AND 
LOOK AT HOW QUICKLY SHE REACTED 
HER FORMER AS WELL VERY QUICK 
THINKING THERE IS THE NEW ELEMENT 
THE CROSSED HAND THAT IS SPEEDY 
THINKING THAT'S QUICK REACTION 
SHE ALMOST HIT HANDSTAND AS WELL 
THERE WOULD SHE GET BONUS MARKS 
FOR THAT 
THE TROUBLE IS THIS TERM 
WAS A BIT LATE CAN YOU SEE HOW 
LATE BUT SHE JUST GOES SO WELL 
INTO THE DISMOUNT 
THAT EXPERIENCE 
FOR YOU ISN'T IT 
A TEST FOR THE 
JUDGES THAT'S WHY SHE DID IT 
WONDERFUL 
SHE IS HAVING A WORD WONDERFUL WITH HER MANAGER ABOUT WHY SHE DID 
WHAT SHE DID THEY ALL TRAINEES EXITS YOU'VE GOT 
TO BE PREPARED FOR ALL 
EVENTUALITIES 
YES SHE WILL HAVE EVENTUALITIES DONE THAT IN TRAINING THAT'S THE 
TROUBLE IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT THE 
NEW SKILL IS DIFFICULT ALTHOUGH IT 
HAS BEEN GIVEN AN F. RATING WHICH 
IS ABSOLUTE TOP IT IS DIFFICULT 
BUT IT IS THE LINK OUT OF IT IT 
DEPENDS ON HOW YOU CATCH IT THE CROWD ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THAT SHE GOES INTO SECOND STELIANA NISTOR TOOK SILVER AT THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS LAST YEAR NICE CATCHING FLOATED IN THERE 
A LITTLE LATE FORM ON THE SHOOT

DISMOUNT MAKES THAT LANDING THE WORLD CHAMPION IS EUROPEAN CHAMPION TWO GYMNASTS WHO SHOULD REALLY 
IMPRESSED ARE SANDRA IZBASA AND

ARE BOTH YET TO ACHIEVE A EUROPEAN 
GOLD MEDAL ON THIS APPARATUS COULD 
THIS BE THEIR YEAR SANDRA IZBASA NOW SUFFERING WITH A 
BIT OF INJURY LAST YEAR

SHOULDER AS SHE STANDS THE FRONT 
SOMERSAULT EVERYTHING LOOKS WELL 
WITHIN HER CAPABILITIES SHE FLOATS 
OVER ON THE SIDE SOMERSAULT 
DOESN'T LOOK FRENETIC 
THAT GIVES HER TEN SECONDS TO MAKE 
THE DISMOUNT LIFTS TRIPLE JUST 
ABOUT I THINK 
DO YOU THINK SHE GOT 
ROUND THIS WAS THE LITTLE WOBBLE ON THE BEAM NOW IT IS REALLY ABOUT 
PACKING AT LEAST TWO DIFFICULTIES 
PER LENGTH THAT IS AN UNUSUAL SPIN 
GYMNASTS HAVE TO INCLUDE A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SPIN 
VERY NICELY DONE 
SHE'S LOVELY AND SUPPLE WHICH IS 
WHAT MAKES THIS WORK LOOK SO EASY

ASYMMETRIC BARS WORKER

HAS IT 
WONDERFUL STUFF SO LIGHT

COMPETITOR SHE'S DOING IT IN

MEASURE OF A CLASS PERFORMER COMES
