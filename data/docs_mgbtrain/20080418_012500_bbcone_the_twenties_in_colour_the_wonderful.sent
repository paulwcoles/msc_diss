FOR AN HISTORIAN OF THE MIDDLE EAST 
THE ALBERT KAHN COLLECTION HOLDS SOME OF THE MOST STARTLING IMAGES 
THEY'VE CAUGHT A MOMENT THAT IS NOW UTTERLY LOST 
TO VIEW THESE FILMS OR TO LOOK AT THESE COLOURED PHOTOGRAPHS 
WITH ALL THEIR STARTLING CLARITY IS ALMOST 
TO CLIMB INTO A TIME MACHINE THAT TAKES YOU BACK 
TO A MIDDLE EAST THAT WE COULD ONLY IMAGINE 
THE FACT THAT SOME OF THEM ARE IN COLOUR MAKE THEM VERY MODERN PICTURES 
WHICH IS AMAZING BECAUSE SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEY WERE TAKEN 
WELL IT SHOWS WHERE I BELONG WHERE I COME FROM 
WHERE MY FAMILY COMES FROM AND THE TREMENDOUS CHANGES 
THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN A WAY OF LIFE FROM THOSE DAYS TO THESE DAYS 
AT A FORMATIVE MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE REGION ALBERT KAHN'S CAMERAS 
DOCUMENTED SOME OF THE EVENTS THAT SHAPED THE DESTINY OF THE MIDDLE EAST 
IN THE YEARS AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR HIS PHOTOGRAPHERS WOULD WITNESS 
THE DISINTEGRATION OF OLD EMPIRES AND THE BIRTH OF NATIONS 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE FRENCH MILLIONAIRE 
ALBERT KAHN LAUNCHED A UNIQUE PHOTOGRAPHIC PROJECT 
HE WANTED TO RECORD THE EVERYDAY LIFE 
OF CULTURES FROM AROUND THE WORLD 
BEFORE THEY COULD BE ERADICATED BY THE FORCES OF MODERNITY 
AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS MADE 
NUMEROUS VISITS TO THE CAPTIAL OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE ISTANBUL 
FROM HERE THE SULTAN HAD RULED OVER THE MIDDLE EAST FOR MORE THAN FOUR CENTURIES 
BUT AFTER YEARS OF DECLINE AND THE TURKS' ILL JUDGED 
DECISION TO SIDE WITH GERMANY THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE COLLAPSED 
THE VICTORIOUS ALLIES DECIDED THE FATE 
OF THE EMPIRE'S FORMER TERRITORIES 
THE BRITISH AND FRENCH THOUGHT OF THE WHOLE WORLD 
AND OF THIS AREA IN PARTICULAR AS A BIG CAKE 
AND THEY DIVIDED IT AND DECIDED WHO GETS A PIECE OF WHAT 
THE MAP OF THE MIDDLE EAST WAS REDRAWN 
TO CREATE A NEW REGION MADE UP OF MODERN NATION STATES 
THIS WOULD CHANGE THE DESTINIES OF COUNTRIES 
WHERE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS MUSLIMS CHRISTIANS AND JEWS 
HAD LIVED SIDE BY SIDE UNDER OTTOMAN RULE 
ALBERT KAHN WANTED TO MAKE A RECORD OF THE MIDDLE EAST 
AT THIS TURNING POINT IN ITS HISTORY 
IN NINETEEN NINETEEN KAHN GAVE LUCIEN LE SAINT A VETERAN WAR CAMERAMAN 
A NEW ASSIGNMENT WHEN HE SENT HIM TO LEBANON 
AFTER THE DEFEAT OF THE TURKS THE BRITISH FORCES OCCUPYING LEBANON AND SYRIA TRANSFERRED CONTROL TO FRANCE 
LE SAINT'S CAMERA CAPTURED THE TRIUMPHANT BRITISH WITHDRAWAL 
THESE ARE MARVELLOUS PICTURES OF BRITISH AND INDIAN TROOPS MARCHING 
OVER THE MOUNTAINS FROM INLAND SYRIA AND DOWN TOWARDS THE COAST 
THESE TROOPS COULD ALMOST HAVE BEEN TROOPS IN THE NAPOLEONIC WARS 
IT'S REALLY FASCINATING TO SEE THEM MARCHING ALONG WITH THEIR PACK MULES 
AND THEIR CAMELS SOME SOLDIERS DRIVING 
TWO OR THREE SHEEP IN FRONT OF THEM 
NO DOUBT TO PROVIDE THE DINNERS FOR THAT CONTINGENT THE NEXT WEEK 
THERE YOU SEE INDIAN TROOPS WHICH OF COURSE PLAYED A HUGE ROLE 
IN THE BRITISH ARMY THAT INEXHAUSTIBLE SUPPLY OF INDIAN MANPOWER 
ON WHICH THE BRITISH DEPENDED IN TWO WORLD WARS 
OVER TWO AND A HALF MILLION BRITISH AND IMPERIAL SOLDIERS 
FOUGHT IN THIS REGION 
THEY'D BEEN JOINED BY ARAB FORCES 
THAT WERE RISING UP AGAINST THE OTTOMANS 
THIS SO CALLED ARAB REVOLT HAD BEEN PROMOTED BY 
THE BRITISH OFFICER T. E. LAWRENCE THE FAMOUS LAWRENCE OF ARABIA 
IN RETURN FOR THEIR ALLEGIANCE THE ARABS 
WERE PROMISED INDEPENDENCE IN A SELF GOVERNING UNITED ARAB STATE 
ONE OF THEIR LEADERS WAS THIS MAN AMIR FAISAL 
IN THE SYRIAN CAPITAL DAMASCUS 
HE WAITED FOR THE BRITISH TO HONOUR THEIR PROMISE 
BUT IN A SECRET WARTIME ACCORD THE BRITISH HAD ALSO AGREED 
TO HAND OVER CONTROL OF SYRIA AND LEBANON TO THE FRENCH 
THE FRENCH WERE MORE INTERESTED IN SYRIA AND LEBANON 
WHERE THEY'D HAD CONTACTS WITH THE MARONITES 
THE SO CALLED CATHOLICS OF THAT REGION SINCE THE CRUSADES 
THE FRENCH FELT THAT THEY WERE THE PROTECTORS OF 
THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES IN THE EAST 
AND THEY HAD LARGE FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS THERE 
BY NINETEEN NINETEEN FRANCE WAS POISED TO TAKE 
CONTROL OF AN AREA INHABITED BY BOTH MUSLIMS AND THE CHRISTIAN MARONITES 
THE FRENCH WERE SYMPATHETIC TO THE DEMANDS OF THEIR FELLOW CHRISTIANS 
WHO WANTED TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE COUNTRY KNOWN AS LE GRANDE LEBAN 
GREATER LEBANON 
BEIRUT AND THE WHOLE OF LEBANON HAD SUFFERED DESPERATELY DURING THE WAR 
A TURKISH EMBARGO CUT OFF FOOD SUPPLIES 
AND BROUGHT MASS STARVATION 
THE BRITISH MOUNTED A MASSIVE RELIEF EFFORT 
BY THE TIME LE SAINT ARRIVED LIFE WAS RETURNING TO NORMAL 
LOOKING AT THESE PICTURES 
GIVES US AN INCREDIBLE INSIGHT INTO WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE AT THAT TIME 
THIS WAS STILL RATHER A BACKWARD CORNER OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE 
IT'S A LOST CITY IT'S A CITY BEFORE THE MOTOR CAR ARRIVED 
YOU'RE REMINDED WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE FILMS THAT ARAB OTTOMAN TOWNS 
EVEN IN A PORT CITY LIKE BEIRUT WERE REALLY BETTER SUITED TOWARDS 
ANIMAL TRAFFIC THAN FOUR WHEEL TRAFFIC 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I ENJOYED THE MOST WATCHING THIS 
FILM FOOTAGE WAS THE SCENES OF DAILY LIFE IN BEIRUT 
PEOPLE GOING ABOUT THEIR SHOPPING TRANSPORTING GOODS 
PLAYING AMUSING THEMSELVES 
WE JUST GET A LOOK AT LIFE IN THE CITY IT'S COMPLETELY NATURAL 
WE HAVE THE SENSE THAT THERE'S NOTHING POSED ABOUT IT 
THERE'S A WONDERFUL PICTURE OF STREET ENTERTAINERS A TAME MONKEY 
AND SOME CHILDREN ATTEMPTING A BELLY DANCE 
THE PEOPLE OF BEIRUT TURNED OUT IN FORCE TO WELCOME THEIR NEW GOVERNOR 
GENERAL HENRI GOURAUD WAS A FRENCH WAR HERO 
HE'D LOST HIS RIGHT ARM FIGHTING THE TURKS AT GALLIPOLI 
LE SAINT WAS SENT TO FILM 
GOURAUD'S INAUGURATION AS THE FIRST FRENCH HIGH COMMISSIONER OF LEBANON 
THE POWER OF THAT MOMENT IS BEAUTIFULLY CAPTURED IN THE PHOTOGRAPH 
WHICH SHOWS THE QUAYSIDE AND THERE YOU SEE IN VIVID COLOUR 
THE RED WHITE AND BLUE OF THE FRENCH TRICOLOUR 
AND YOU REALLY GET A SENSE OF THE MASSING OF THE PEOPLE 
YOU CAN PRACTICALLY HEAR THEM CALLING OUT VIVE GOURAUD 
THE FRENCH WAR CORRESPONDENT ALBERT LONDRES 
WITNESSED THE EXCITEMENT WHEN GOURAUD ARRIVED 
THE CANNONS CONTINUE TO THUNDER 
THE PEOPLE SPREAD THEMSELVES OUT ON THE PAVEMENTS 
THEY WAVE FROM THE WINDOWS AND THE ROOFS 
THEY WERE CLINGING TO THE BUILDINGS 
THEY CRIED LONG LIVE GENERAL GOURAUD 
LONG LIVE FRANCE 
YOU SEE HIM ON HIS GREAT WHITE HORSE 
WHICH HE'D RIDDEN IN THE VICTORY PARADE 
IN PARIS AT THE END OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
WHICH HAD BEEN SHIPPED OUT FOR HIM SPECIALLY TO RIDE IN BEIRUT 
HE WAS A RAMROD FIGURE WITH A VERY SPECIAL WAY OF 
SALUTING WITH HIS LEFT HAND HELD RATHER HIGH WITH HIS WHITE GLOVE 
ALL THE POMP AND THE CEREMONY AND THE UNIFORMS AND HORSES AND PARADES 
THERE REALLY WAS A DESIRE 
ON THE PART OF THE FRENCH TO SHOW THEY'D ARRIVED AND THAT THEY WERE IMPORTANT 
OF COURSE THE LEVANT POSTINGS IN THOSE DAYS WERE VERY HIGHLY PRIZED 
BECAUSE OF THE WARM WEATHER THE EASY LIFE 
AND THE OFFICERS SPENT THEIR TIME PLAYING TENNIS WITH LOCAL GIRLS 
OR SITTING ROUND IN CAFES 
AND THE TROOPS TOO HAD A VERY GOOD TIME 
WITH HIS CAMERAS LE SAINT RODE THROUGH THE BACK STREETS OF BEIRUT 
OBSERVING THE ACTIVITIES OF FRENCH SOLDIERS WHEN THEY WERE OFF DUTY 
ONE SCENE IN PARTICULAR THAT STANDS OUT IS WITH THE PROSTITUTES 
IN FRONT OF A BROTHEL WHERE WE SEE MAINLY SOLDIERS ESSENTIALLY FLIRTING 
WITH A NUMBER OF THESE PROSTITUTES AND BEHAVING IN QUITE A LEWD MANNER 
YOU CAN SEE THE BROTHEL KEEPER SITTING AT THE DOOR 
A RATHER OLDER PLUMP LADY 
OF COURSE EVERYBODY IS JOSTLING TO HAVE THEIR PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN 
WITH ONE OF THE GIRLS 
THIS WAS A PART OF BEIRUT LIFE WHICH IS NOT THE IMAGE 
THAT WE HAVE TODAY OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND OF MIDDLE EASTERN WOMEN 
THE PROSTITUTES THEMSELVES ARE QUITE KEEN TO PERFORM AS IT WERE 
THEY'RE QUITE KEEN TO BE FILMED AND SEEM QUITE EXCITED 
BY THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN FRONT OF A CAMERA 
WHILE HIS MEN ENJOYED LIFE IN THEIR NEW MIDDLE EASTERN PLAYGROUND 
GENERAL GOURAUD HAD MORE PRESSING MATTERS ON HIS MIND 
HE NEEDED TO REASSURE THE COUNTRY'S MARONITES 
THAT THEIR INTERESTS WOULD BE DEFENDED 
MANY MARONITES WERE CONVINCED THEY WERE ENTITLED TO SPECIAL TREATMENT 
HAVING SUPPORTED THE CHRISTIAN KNIGHTS DURING THE CRUSADES 
THEY BELIEVED THEY SHARED CULTURAL VALUES WITH THE FRENCH 
AS YOU SEE IN THE IMAGES HERE 
THE DELEGATION OF MARONITES THAT CALL ON GOURAUD COULD BE TAKEN 
FOR FRENCHMEN THEMSELVES THEY ARE FRENCH EDUCATED 
THEY ARE FRENCH DRESSED 
YOU CAN SEE THEM IN DOUBLE BREASTED SUITS AND TIES 
THEY'RE WAVING A FLAG THAT LOOKS A VARIATION ON THE TRICOLOUR 
WHEN THEY MEET GOURAUD THOUGH YOU CAN'T HEAR IT 
THEY'LL SPEAK A FRENCH THAT WILL BE AS PERFECT 
AS IF IT WERE SPOKEN ON A BOULEVARD IN PARIS 
THE CHRISTIAN MARONITES URGED 
THE FRENCH TO CREATE A NEW STATE THAT THEY WOULD CONTROL 
THEY WANTED TERRITORY MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE SIZE 
OF THEIR TRADITIONAL HOMELAND CENTRED ON MOUNT LEBANON 
IF GRANTED THIS WOULD BRING LARGE NUMBERS OF MUSLIMS 
ALMOST HALF OF THE COUNTRY UNDER CHRISTIAN MARONITE RULE 
EVENTUALLY THE MARONITES GOT THEIR WAY 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY GOURAUD ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF THE NEW STATE 
OF GREATER LEBANON 
BUT FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE REGION 
GOURAUD'S DECISION CAME AT A HEAVY PRICE 
THE SEPARATION OF LEBANON AND SYRIA 
WAS VIOLENT 
CITIES THAT HAD ALWAYS ENJOYED TRADE RELATIONS AND WHOSE PEOPLE 
HAD MOVED FREELY NOW FOUND THEMSELVES 
IN TWO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WHICH BROKE LONGSTANDING 
ECONOMIC TIES FAMILY TIES AND A NOTION OF A BROADER COMMUNITY 
TO MANY ARABS THE TRANSFER OF POWER TO THE FRENCH WAS A BETRAYAL 
THEY'D FOUGHT ALONGSIDE THE BRITISH IN THEIR 
BATTLES AGAINST THE OTTOMANS NOW IT SEEMED THE BRITISH 
WERE RENEGING ON THEIR PROMISE TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE OF ARAB INDEPENDENCE 
AND IN CREATING GREATER LEBANON FROM PEOPLES OF DIVERSE RELIGIOUS 
AND ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS THE EUROPEAN POWERS HAD SET IN MOTION 
CONFLICT THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO THE PRESENT DAY 
WHILE FRANCE GOVERNED LEBANON AND SYRIA BRITAIN TOOK CONTROL 
OF IRAQ TRANSJORDAN AND PALESTINE 
ALBERT KAHN SENT HIS PHOTOGRAPHERS ON THREE MISSIONS TO JERUSALEM 
IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE GREAT WAR 
IN DECEMBER NINETEEN SEVENTEEN THE CAPTURE OF PALESTINE 
BY BRITISH TROOPS HAD BEEN ONE OF THE GREAT MILITARY TRIUMPHS OF WORLD WAR ONE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS 
THE HOLY LAND WAS UNDER CHRISTIAN RULE 
BY THE TIME THE BRITISH ARRIVED 
JERUSALEM WAS BATTERED AND WAR WEARY 
MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE POPULATION HAD EITHER FLED OR DIED 
THE BRITISH SOLDIERS WHEN THEY CAME INTO JERUSALEM DIDN'T FIND 
THE GOLDEN CITY OF GOD 
THEY REALLY FOUND 
A VERY DESPERATE VILLAGE WHICH HAD GONE THROUGH 
YEARS OF STARVATION 
AND WITH NO SERVICES AT ALL NO WATER NO MEDICAL SERVICES NO FOOD 
THIS WAS A CITY WHERE HUNGER AND STARVATION RESIDED NOT GOD 
I REMEMBER MY FATHER TOLD ME THAT THE HARDEST YEARS 
WERE THE YEARS OF THE WAR 
THEY WERE VERY POOR THERE WERE YEARS OF GREAT HUNGER 
GREAT GREAT POVERTY TO SUCH A POINT THAT A SIMPLE 
COMMODITY SUCH AS TABLE SALT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE TO BUY 
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PICTURES WE SEE THE DUST 
THEY THEY DON'T GLAMORISE IT THEY DON'T ROMANTICISE IT 
AT THE END OF OTTOMAN RULE PALESTINE WAS HOME 
TO THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION ARABS 
SOME WERE BEDOUINS WHO LIVED OFF THE LAND 
TRADITIONALLY THE LIVES OF BEDOUIN PEOPLE 
REVOLVED AROUND THEIR VILLAGES AND THEIR FAMILIES 
FOR CENTURIES THEY'D LIVED PEACEFULLY 
ALONGSIDE THE COUNTRY'S MUSLIMS AND JEWS 
WHEN MY GRANDMOTHER MARRIED MY GRANDFATHER 
SHE MARRIED WHEN SHE WAS THIRTEEN 
IT WAS THE JEWISH NEIGHBOUR WHO SHOWED HER HOW TO COOK 
HOW TO DOMESTICATE HER HUSBAND WHO TRAINED HER 
IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD 
WE BECAME VERY FRIENDLY WITH THE ARABS LIVING NEXT DOOR 
IN FACT THE OLD LADY NEXT DOOR WAS ALMOST AS MUCH MY GRANDMOTHER 
AS MY REAL GRANDMOTHER I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THERE 
I USED TO CALL HER AUNTIE 
BOTH MY MOTHER AND MY GRANDMOTHER SPOKE ARABIC SO THEY COULD CONVERSE 
FREELY WITH THE ARABS AND THE ARABS SPOKE HEBREW 
TODAY NO DOUBT THERE ARE MANY MORE ARABS WHO SPEAK A GOOD HEBREW 
THAN THERE ARE JEWS WHO EVEN BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND ARABIC 
THERE WAS NO AWARENESS OF DIFFERENCE 
THERE WAS A CLOSENESS A GREAT CLOSENESS BETWEEN MUSLIMS AND JEWS 
BUT THIS HARMONY WAS ABOUT TO BE TORN APART 
BY A CONTROVERSIAL BRITISH POLICY 
JEWISH ZIONISTS HAD BEEN CALLING 
FOR THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL HOMELAND IN PALESTINE 
AFTER YEARS OF CAMPAIGNING THEY PERSUADED THE BRITISH 
FOREIGN SECRETARY LORD BALFOUR TO BACK THEIR CAUSE 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN BALFOUR WROTE A LETTER TO ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THIS MOVEMENT 
HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT VIEW WITH FAVOUR THE ESTABLISHMENT 
IN PALESTINE OF A NATIONAL HOME FOR THE JEWISH PEOPLE 
IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT NOTHING SHALL BE DONE WHICH 
MAY PREJUDICE THE RIGHTS OF EXISTING NON JEWISH COMMUNITIES IN PALESTINE 
THE LETTER WHICH BECAME KNOWN AS THE BALFOUR DECLARATION 
WOULD HAVE PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE OF PALESTINE 
IN THAT SEEMINGLY SIMPLE STATEMENT 
BALFOUR HAD MADE QUITE A HUGE COMMITMENT 
HE HAD NOW WEDDED BRITISH POLICY 
TO CREATE A JEWISH ENTITY IN PALESTINE 
FOR THE MUSLIMS OF PALESTINE THE ZIONIST CAMPAIGN WAS A THREAT 
THESE PICTURES SHOW ONE OF FRANCE'S MOST SENIOR CLERICS CARDINAL DUBOIS 
ARRIVING IN JERUSALEM ON A DIPLOMATIC AND RELIGIOUS MISSION 
CARDINAL DUBOIS WAS CARRYING A PETITION 
SIGNED BY PALESTINIAN MUSLIMS OPPOSED TO THE BALFOUR DECLARATION 
IT READ IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE AND OF EQUALITY 
WE ASK YOU NOT TO ALLOW JEWISH IMMIGRATION TO PALESTINE 
AND TO REMOVE FROM US THE ZIONIST DANGER 
WE CANNOT PERMIT THIS WITHOUT SACRIFICING OUR PRECIOUS BLOOD 
BUT BALFOUR IGNORED THE PROTESTS OF PALESTINE'S MUSLIM POPULATION 
BRITAIN'S COMMITMENT TO A ZIONIST HOMELAND 
IGNITED TENSIONS BETWEEN JEWS AND MUSLIMS 
BALFOUR BELONGED TO A GROUP OF CHRISTIAN ZIONISTS 
HE KNEW THE KINGS OF THE BIBLE BEFORE HE LEARNT ANYTHING 
ABOUT BRITISH KINGS SO HE FELT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE HOLY LAND 
HE FELT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE JEWISH PEOPLE 
HE FELT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE NEED TO RETURN 
AND OF COURSE HE SAW THAT HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO BE THE ONE WHO RETURNS THE JEWS TO THE HOLY LAND 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS FOLLOWED LORD BALFOUR 
ON HIS HISTORIC VISIT TO JERUSALEM 
IN THE YEARS SINCE HE'D MADE HIS FAMOUS DECLARATION 
ALMOST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND JEWS HAD ARRIVED IN PALESTINE 
BALFOUR LAID FOUNDATION STONES AT THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY 
AN INSTITUTION INTENDED TO TURN HEBREW INTO A LIVING LANGUAGE 
AND GIVE THE NEW JEWISH SETTLERS A STRONG NATIONAL IDENTITY 
WE ARE NOW SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE BALFOUR DECLARATION 
UM THOUSANDS OF JEWS ALREADY LIVE IN PALESTINE AS A RESULT OF THAT DECLARATION 
THE ZIONIST DREAM STARTS TO REALISE ITSELF 
AND HERE THE MAN HIMSELF COMES TO JERUSALEM 
TO ATTEND THE OPENING OF THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY ON MOUNT SCOPUS IN JERUSALEM 
AND THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY EVENT 
THESE PICTURES ARE EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE THIS WAS A VERY VERY POLITICAL EVENT 
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY 
THERE WERE ABOUT I RECKON ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE PRESENT THERE 
AND AMONG THEM WERE MY FATHER AND MOTHER WHO WERE INVITED 
BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS CONSIDERED 
A PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY 
I CAN SEE THE GREAT ENTHUSIASM WITH WHICH 
ESPECIALLY BALFOUR WAS GREETED 
WHEN THE INVITED GUESTS SEE HIM WALKING UP MOUNT SCOPUS 
TO THEM HE IS THE MESSIAH 
HE IS THE REDEEMER 
HE IS THE MAN WHO IS ACTUALLY RETURNING THE JEWISH PEOPLE 
FROM EXILE TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
TO RAPTUROUS CROWDS BALFOUR OUTLINED HIS VISION 
OF A NEW JEWISH HOMELAND 
THIS IS A NEW EXPERIMENT IT HAS NEVER BEEN TRIED BEFORE 
UNLESS I HAVE PROFOUNDLY MISTAKEN THE GENIUS OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE 
THE EXPERIMENT IS PREDESTINED TO INEVITABLE SUCCESS 
ON WHICH NOT ONLY MEN OF JEWISH BIRTH 
BUT OTHERS SHARING THE COMMON CIVILISATION OF THE WORLD 
WILL HAVE REASON TO CONGRATULATE THEMSELVES 
I WOULD SAY HE LOOKED MESSIANIC I CAN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER WORD 
HE WAS WEARING ONE OF THESE UNIVERSITY ROBES 
AND HE HAD THIS HAIR THAT WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE 
AND HE WAS USING HIS HANDS A LOT AS HE SPOKE 
MY PARENTS TOLD ME THIS IS IT 
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR 
AFTER LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY 
BALFOUR VISITED THE NEW COLLECTIVE FARMS 
WHICH WERE BEING SET UP BY JEWS ACROSS PALESTINE 
THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE BUILT ON LAND BOUGHT FROM THE ARABS 
LORD BALFOUR'S VISIT TO PALESTINE WAS SOMETHING OF A TRIUMPHAL TOUR 
OF THE ARCHITECT OF THE JEWISH NATIONAL HOME 
COMING TO SEE THE FIRST FRUITS OF THIS PLEDGE 
THIS PROMISE THIS POLICY 
I THINK ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING PICTURES IS WHERE YOU SEE THE STAR OF DAVID 
A SOMEWHAT MAKESHIFT STAR OF DAVID AND THE BRITISH FLAG TOGETHER 
AND THAT SYMBOLISES EVERYTHING 
MANY OF THE JEWS CHEERING BALFOUR IN TEL AVIV 
HAD ARRIVED IN PALESTINE AFTER FLEEING PERSECUTION 
IN EASTERN EUROPE AND RUSSIA 
YOU REALLY HAVE A SENSE OF HOW LARGE THE ZIONIST POPULATION OF PALESTINE 
WAS ALREADY IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE 
AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO MISTAKING THE IMMIGRANT NATURE OF THIS COMMUNITY THESE ARE 
VERY EUROPEAN LOOKING PEOPLE 
REALLY A PEOPLE APART FROM THE PALESTINIANS THEMSELVES 
OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE VERY ONE SIDED PICTURES 
BECAUSE THEY ONLY SHOW THE ZIONIST JOY 
THEY DON'T SHOW THE REACTION OF THE ARABS TO BALFOUR'S VISIT 
AT THE TIME JERUSALEM'S MUSLIM SHOPKEEPERS BATTENED THEIR DOORS 
AND LOCKED THEIR SHUTTERS IN PROTEST AT BALFOUR'S VISIT 
PEOPLE WERE VERY UPSET 
THERE WAS A GENERAL STRIKE 
THEY DRESSED IN MOURNING AND OF COURSE WHAT BALFOUR DID WAS A GREAT BETRAYAL 
WAS CONSIDERED AS A GREAT BETRAYAL TO THE ARABS 
WHILE PALESTINIAN ARABS WERE LEFT IN DESPAIR 
FOR MANY ZIONISTS BALFOUR'S POLICY WAS A MOMENT OF DESTINY 
THE BRITISH KEPT THEIR PROMISE 
IT WAS WITH BRITISH ASSISTANCE THAT THE ZIONIST MOVEMENT WAS ABLE TO BRING 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JEWS TO PALESTINE 
IT EVENTUALLY LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL 
BUT WE ALSO SEE HOW INEVITABLE THE WAR BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS WAS 
IT'S NOT THE FAULT OF THE BRITISH 
IT WAS JUST INEVITABLE 
OPENING PALESTINE TO THE ZIONIST DREAM MEANT WAR 
IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT THE STATE OF ISRAEL WAS ESTABLISHED 
ALMOST A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AFTER HIS VISIT 
BALFOUR'S PROMISE HAD BECOME A POLITICAL REALITY 
THE FILM AND PHOTOGRAPHS SHOT BY ALBERT KHAN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS 
ARE A UNIQUE RECORD OF A PIVOTAL PERIOD IN THE HISTORY OF THE MIDDLE EAST 
THEY WITNESSED THE DESTRUCTION OF EMPIRES AND THE BIRTH OF NATIONS 
THE TRIUMPHANT REALISATION OF POLITICAL DREAMS FOR SOME 
AND THE NIGHTMARISH EXPERIENCE OF DISPOSSESSION FOR OTHERS 
KAHN'S CAMERAS CAPTURED SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS OF THE AGE 
PRESERVING MOMENTS THAT CHANGED THE FACE 
OF THIS TROUBLED REGION FOR EVER
