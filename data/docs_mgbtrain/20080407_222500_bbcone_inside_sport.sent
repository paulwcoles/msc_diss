RACISM ON THE FOOTBALL TERRACES OF 
POLAND WALTER SMITH KING OF SCOTS 
AND VICTORIA PENDLETON'S SECRETS 
THAT'S TONIGHT ON INSIDE SPORT 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO INSIDE SPORT 
WITH ME GABBY LOGAN THERE'S A LOT 
MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON THE 
STADIUMS AND TRANSPORT SYSTEMS IN 
POLAND BEFORE THE COUNTRY HOSTS THE 
EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BUT 
POLISH FOOTBALL'S GOT ANOTHER 
NASTIER PROBLEM TO SOLVE OUR 
SPORTS EDITOR MIHIR BOSE HAS A 
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION INTO RACISM 
ON THE TERRACES IN WARSAW AND HE 
ASKS WILL POLAND BE ABLE TO PUT THE 
PROBLEM RIGHT IN TIME FOR THE 
EUROS 
THEY ARE NOT READY ON THE EUROS RACES IN FRONT 
HE'S THE MAN WITH 
THE MIDAS TOUCH IN SCOTTISH 
FOOTBALL MEET RANGERS BOSS WALTER 
SMITH WHO TALKS RANGERS RESPECT 
AND GAZZA 
A GENIUS OF PLAYING 
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE THAT IT 
IS A GENIUS 
THE FASTEST THING ON 
TWO WHEELS MATTHEW PINSENT 
CATCHES UP WITH VICTORIA PENDLETON 
SHE MAY BE A WORLD CHAMPION BUT 
JUST LIKE ANY GIRL SHE ENJOYS 
NOTHING BETTER THAN A DAY OF 
PAMPERING AT THE SPA AND MORE 
PROTESTS IN PARIS AS THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH IS CARRIED THROUGH THE 
STREETS WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL THEY 
MAKE 
FREE TIBET WITH ME TONIGHT A MAN 
WHO NEVER PROTESTS TOO MUCH STEVE 
BUNCE OF THE INDEPENDENT AND A MAN 
WITH MANY BURNING PASSIONS SPORTS 
BROADCASTER TONY LIVESEY IT'S 
HARD TO IMAGINE SEEING THESE KIND 
OF OPENLY RACIST BANNERS AT A 
FOOTBALL MATCH IN ENGLAND BUT IN 
POLAND YOU CAN THE POLISH 
AUTHORITIES ARE TRYING HARD TO RID 
THE TERRACES OF RACISM BUT 
QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT 
WHETHER THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT 
BEFORE THE COUNTRY HOSTS THE EUROS 
IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OUR SPORTS EDITOR MIHIR 
BOSE WENT TO THE POLISH CAPITAL 
WARSAW TO INVESTIGATE 
THIS PROBLEM IS EXISTING NOW IN IN THIS MOMENT IT IS NOT PREPARED I I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE READY NOT NOT READY ON THE RACES AND FRONT 
IN FOUR YEARS POLAND WILL WELCOME 
THE REST OF EUROPE TO THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
CHAMPIONSHIP THERE IS A LOT OF 
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE BUILT BUT 
THAT MAY NOT BE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM 
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO CHANGE MAY 
BE THE DEEP SEATED RACES AND THAT 
STILL EXISTS IN POLISH FOOTBALL IT 
IS HOPED IN HOLDING THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP RACES AND CAN BE 
ERADICATED HERE THE QUESTIONNAIRES 
IN FOUR YEARS YOU CAN BUILD A LOT 
OF ROADS AND STADIUMS BUT CAN YOU 
CHANGE WHAT I HAVE FOUND TO BE 
DEEPLY INGRAINED RACIST ATTITUDES 
I HAD ARRANGED TO MEET WITH THE 
ONLY AND TWO RACES AND CREEPING 
POLAND THEY WERE NOT BASED THERE 
THEY DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICE DUE TO 
A LACK OF FUNDING AND THEIR FEAR OF 
BEING FIREBOMBED PROMOTING 
TOLERANCE IS A DANGER AS BUSINESSES 
THERE IS THIS CLIMATE THAT IS BUILT 
ON WHITE MEN THIS ATMOSPHERE OF US 
AND THEM 
WE FOUND A CAFE ON THE 
OUTSKIRTS WHERE HE WAS HAPPY TO 
DISCUSS THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE 
PROBLEM AND THE DANGERS I WITH MY 
SKIN COLOUR MIGHT FIND IN THE 
STADIUM 
THERE ARE NLY A FEW CLUBS STADIUM IN POLAND FIRST SECOND DIVISION 
THAT IT IS O. K. FOR YOU TO GO ARGUE ARGUE SAYING THAT BEING BROWN I WOULD BE 
IN SOME PHYSICAL DANGER IF I 
WENT UNFORTUNATELY YES IT IS 
A WHITE COLOURED DOMINATED YOUTH 
YOU WOULD BE IN DANGER 
THE MOST 
SHOCKING THING ABOUT THE IMAGES HE 
SHOWED ME WHICH WERE TAKEN IN 
POLISH STADIUM IN THE LAST TWO 
SEASONS WAS THE ARROGANCE WITH 
WHICH FANS DISPLAYED THEIR VIEWS 
THIS IS GROUP OF POLISH 
SUPPORTERS OF THE NATIONAL TEAM 
THEY HAVE A RACIST SYMBOLS AND THE 
T. SHIRT OF THE NATIONAL TEAM WITH 
EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH IS THE EIGHTH LETTER OF THE 
ALPHABET WHICH MEANS HITLER THE 
INTERESTING GREETING OF HITLER 
IT EXTENDS FROM SKINHEADS TO THE 
LOWER DIVISIONS WHERE IT SEEMS EVEN 
WORSE 
THEY FORMED THE SWASTIKA BY WORSE STANDING IN THE SIGN IT IS 
SOMETHING SICK 
IN SOME CASES THE 
MESSAGE IS NOT JUST BANNERS IT CAN 
LEAD TO VIOLENCE HE TOLD ME ABOUT 
A BLACK PLAYER ASSAULTED IN THE 
THIRD DIVISION GAME 
HE IS CALLED A 
RACIST TERM IN THE FIRST HALF THE 
SUPPORTERS STARTED TO SHOUT AT HIM 
HIS TEAM WAS WINNING AND THEY THREW 
BANANAS AT HIM HE TOOK A BENIGN 
AND STARTED TO EAT IT HE MADE A 
JOKE OF IT BANANA AFTER THE 
MATCH THE RACIST SKINHEADS CAME ON 
THE PITCH AND BEAT THE GUY UP HE 
WAS IN HOSPITAL FOR TWO WEEKS WORK WORK BEING DONE BY VOLUNTEERS IS 
STARTING TO CHANGE THINGS WARSAW'S 
MAIN TEAM LEGIA WARSAW SHOWS HOW 
FAR THEY HAVE TO GO THIS THE 
VIOLENCE WAS IN AN AWAY GAME THEY 
BATTLED WITH HOOLIGANISM AND RAISES 
HIM IT HAS CAUSED A RIFT BETWEEN 
EXTREMIST FANS WHO ARE TRYING TO 
ADDRESS THE ISSUE TRAINING THE DAY 
BEFORE WAS LIKE AT ANY CLUB 
PLAYERS OF THERE IS ENOUGH CHANCES 
AND COLOURS CONCERNED ONLY WITH 
FOOTBALL THIS TOLERANCE AND 
MULTICULTURALISM IS STILL A LONG 
WAY FROM BEING EVIDENCE ON THE 
TERRACES DIXON MAY BE AN 
ESTABLISHED MEMBER OF THE TEAM THAT 
HE HAS PROBLEMS WITH FANS BECAUSE 
HE IS BLACK 
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE HAD A LOT OF 
PROBLEMS ABOUT RACES AND AND HAD TO 
COPE WITH RACIST ABUSE AND MONKEY 
CHANTING AND BANANAS TELL US ABOUT 
THE PROBLEMS 
THE PROBLEM IS THE 
MATCHES WHERE WE PLAY AWAY THERE 
ARE SOME SUPPORTERS WHO SHOUT SOME 
STUPID WORDS MONKEY CHANTS IT IS 
FOR BLACK PEOPLE TOUGH IN THIS 
STADIUM IF YOU GO HERE IN THIS 
PART IT IS NOT GOOD IF YOU SIT 
HERE THERE IS NO PROBLEM MY 
FRIENDS STAYED HERE AND THEY COME 
AND SIT THERE 
YOU'RE BLACK FRIENDS 
SIT THERE BUT NOT OVER THERE THEY THEY CANNOT SIT THERE 
DIXON TOLD ME 
ABOUT THE ABUSE HE SUFFERED AND THE 
PROBLEMS HE FACED WHEN HE SPOKE UP 
TO MY SURPRISE I PLAYED AWAY ME 
AND IF YOU BRAZILIANS EVERY TIME 
YOU GO TO TAKE THE BALL OR THROW IN 
WE ARE GREETED WITH CHANTS THAT 
MATCH I WAS ANGRY L. KNOW I AM 
BLACK THEY CALLED ME TO THE 
COMMITTEE AND I TOLD THEM EVEN MY 
WIFE WAS AT TIME AND TO MY SURPRISE 
THE MANAGER OF THEIR TEAM WAS ALSO 
CAUGHT AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T HERE 
ANYTHING 
BUT DO YOU FEEL POLAND AT ANYTHING THE MOMENT IS NOT READY FOR TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
BUT IT NEEDS MORE TO DO TO MAKE 
SURE YOU DO NOT HAVE INCIDENTS LIKE 
THIS 
FOR ME TO ORGANISE THIS THIS ALREADY BUT THE RACE IS SOMETHING 
I DO NOT THINK THEY 
ARE READY 
THEY THEY ARE NOT READY ON THE RACES IN FRONT THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING A FRONT A MILITARY CLUB HISTORICALLY THE 
BATTLE NOW IS WITH ITSELF THE 
EXTREME FAN GROUPS AND THEIR OPENLY 
RACIST ABUSE YOUR CLUB 
PARTICULARLY HAS HAD PROBLEMS WITH 
RACES AND IT IS BANNED IN EUROPE 
AT THE MOMENT WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
ABOUT IT 
FIRST OF ALL I WOULD 
LIKE TO SAY IN OUR COUNTRY IN 
POLAND WE HAVE SPECIFIC SITUATIONS 
WE ARE NOT USED TO LIVING TOGETHER 
WITH PEOPLE WHICH A DIFFERENT 
COLOUR OF SKIN DIFFERENT IDEAS OR 
DIFFERENT RELIGION WE ARE TRYING 
TO DISCUSS WITH THE FANS ABOUT THIS 
PROBLEM SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT 
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS A 
PROBLEM THERE IS A PROBLEM THEY 
ARE SHOUTING THAT BEING JEWISH 
RUSSIAN BLACK ARE DIFFERENT FROM 
WHITE POLISH MEN 
SOME FANS WERE 
BANNED BY THE CLUB FOR THEIR 
BEHAVIOUR THIS HAS ANGERED THE 
FANS ASSOCIATION THE PRESIDENT 
TOLD ME THE PROBLEM OF ENTRENCHED 
RAISES HIM 
BUT WITHIN THE ASSOCIATION THERE 
ARE FOUND TO AND NEO NAZIS 
I THINK 
THAT THERE ARE MAYBE FIFTEEN PER CENT MAYBE TWENTY 
FOR ALL THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO TRAVEL AROUND 
THE CITY WITHOUT SEEING FRIGHTENING 
EVIDENCE OF RACIST THINKING MUCH 
CONNECTED TO FOOTBALL AND LEGIA 
WARSAW WHILE FILMING WE WERE 
APPROACHED BY A SKINHEAD HE 
CLAIMED TO BE A FAN OF THE CLUB AND 
WAS ONLY TOO EAGER TO DISPLAY HIS 
RACES HIM YOU ASK A FIRE AT THEM 
I AM A FASCIST HE SAID HE GAVE A 
NAZI SALUTE HE TOLD ME I SHOULD 
STAY IN MY OWN COUNTRY AND THEN HE 
LEFT HE WOULD NOT LOOK AT ME OR 
SHAKE MY HAND RACISTS ON THE 
STRAIGHT BLACK PLAYERS AND FANS IN 
DANGER OPEN DISPLAYS OF NAZISM DO 
THE ORGANISERS OF EURO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE REALLY 
THINK THEY CAN ERADICATE THIS IN 
FOUR YEARS 
I AM AWARE OF THAT 
FACT THAT DURING LEAGUE MATCHES 
POLISH FANS DO RACIST SLOGANS AND 
SHOUT REMARKS MY CONFERENCE AS FAR 
AS THE EURO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IS CONCERNED IS 
BUILT ON THE FACTS AND LET ME 
REASSURE YOU AGAIN THERE HAVE BEEN 
NO RACIST INCIDENTS DURING THE 
NATIONAL TEAM GAMES AM SURE THEY WERE NOT OCCUR IN FOUR YEARS' TIME 
I TRAVELLED ACROSS WARSAW TO THE 
STADIUM I WAS TOLD OF PLACE I 
MIGHT MEET SOME OF THE EXTREMIST 
FANS BEFORE WE TALK TO THEM LET 
ALONE FILM THE FANS ARE TOLD US TO 
GET OUT L. HAVE COME FROM A BAR 
DOWN THE ROAD WHERE WE WERE TOLD 
HARDCORE SUPPORTERS GATHERED WE 
WENT TO IN THE HOPE OF TALKING TO 
THEM ABOUT RACES AND IN FOOTBALL 
IT WAS MADE CLEAR TO US WE WERE NOT 
WELCOME 
AT THE GAME ITSELF THERE WERE 
SIGNS OF THE CHANGE TAKING PLACE 
OF THE STARTING ELEVEN ONLY TO FALL 
WERE POLISH THE BLACK PLAYERS 
APPEAR TO BE ACCEPTED BY THE HOME 
FANS 
DURING THE MATCH THE HARDCORE 
SUPPORTERS LED A PROTEST AGAINST 
THE BARRING OF FANS WHICH SOUGHT 
THE CLUB BAN FROM EUROPE IT STRUCK 
ME THAT WHILE POLISH FOOTBALL IS 
BEGINNING TO TALK ABOUT RACES AND 
THE OFFICIALS HERE ARE NOT IT IS 
THE FANS WERE I WAS STANDING WHERE 
BLACK PEOPLE CANNOT GO BUT ARE 
CALLING THE TUNE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE POET 
WILL STAGE MATCHES IN THE FINAL OF 
THE CHAMPIONSHIPS BUT I HAVE BEEN 
TOLD I CANNOT GO TO THAT STAND OVER 
THERE BECAUSE OF THE COLOUR OF MY 
SKIN MY SAFETY CANNOT BE 
GUARANTEED CHANGE IS IN THE AIR 
AND THE ISSUE OF RACES AND IN 
POLISH FOOTBALL IS BUT 
THE PROBLEM HAS STILL TO BE 
PROPERLY ADDRESSED 
THE SHOCKING SCENES THE FIRST TIME 
I SAW THE FILM I WAS GENUINELY 
SHOCKED INCREDIBLY VIOLENT 
ATTITUDES BUT STILL PREVAIL WE 
HAVE NOT SEEN THAT IN THIS COUNTRY 
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME IN FOOTBALL 
HARD TO IMAGINE WE EVER HAD THAT 
PROBLEM 
THEN THEY HAD BEEN POCKETS PROBLEM LIKE THAT IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES BUT THEY 
WERE THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE WHEN THE 
GUY TALKED ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT WE MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH TWENTY PEOPLE 
NOT TWENTY PER CENT WHAT WAS MOST ALARMING 
WAS HOW BLASE SOME OF THE PEOPLE 
WERE YES WE WILL SORT IT OUT 
THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM 
I DIDN'T 
SEE A SENSE OF URGENCY 
NO RIGHT 
MINDED PERSON THINKS THEY WILL SELL 
IT OVERNIGHT L. THINK WE HAVE SEEN 
THE SCENES LIKE THIS IN THIS 
COUNTRY WHEN I WATCHED FOOTBALL IN 
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES MONKEY CHANTS WERE PAR 
FOR THE COURSE THEY HAPPENED AT 
EVERY GAME THEY IN MIND THERE WAS 
ONLY FOUR YEARS AFTER WE WON THE 
WORLD CUP AT WEMBLEY THE NATIONAL 
FRONT INFILTRATED A LOT OF TEAMS IN 
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
WEST HAM AND ARSENAL HAD TERRIS 
LEGEND THEY REPULSED NOT JUST THE 
NATIONAL FRONT BUT THE P. M. B. N. P. 
THERE IS HOPE FOR POLAND SOCIAL 
REFORM AND EDUCATION WORK IT WOULD 
TAKE A LOT OF TIME FOR THAT TO WORK 
ITS WAY THROUGH 
CLUB FOOTBALL IS 
SO FAR REMOVED IT SEEMS LIKE THE 
CLUB HAD NO POWER 
IT WAS A 
HOOLIGAN ISSUE AND NOT A RACISM 
ISSUE THE CHANT WAS COMPLETELY 
NUTS IT ALMOST LOOKED RELIGIOUS 
WAS IT RIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE TO 
GIVE 
THE TOURNAMENT TO POLAND YES YES THE GREATEST WAY TO DEFEAT THESE 
PEOPLE IS TO TAKE THE BEST PLAYERS 
BLACK PLAYERS IN EUROPE AND SHOW 
THEM HOW CIVILISED OTHER COUNTRIES 
ARE THEY WILL KNOW THAT BRITAIN 
HAD A HOOLIGAN PROBLEM IN THE SEVENTIES 
AND EIGHTIES AND THEY WILL SEE HOW WE 
TURNED IT ROUND THE POLICE DO NEED 
TO GET A GRIP THERE ARE VIDEO 
CLIPS IN SERBIA WHERE THERE ARE 
FANS WEARING BLUE PLAQUES CLAN 
OUTFITS TWO GAMES 
WITH COUNTRIES 
LIKE TOGO NIGERIA PLAYING POLAND 
WHAT ABOUT THAT 
WHEN THE SPANISH 
FANS STARTED BILLING ENGLAND NOT SO 
MANY MONTHS AGO THEY WERE PARIAHS 
THANK YOU FOR THE MOMENT STILL TO 
COME SHE MAY BE THE QUEEN OF THE 
TRACK BUT VICTORIA PENDLETON STILL 
HAS DOUBTS ABOUT HERSELF 
I DO NOT 
KNOW WHERE I HAVE GOT THIS 
INFERIORITY THING L. NEED 
TO PROVE TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT I AM TALENTED 
THREE HE IS THE MAN WITH THE MIDAS 
TOUCH IN SCOTTISH FOOTBALL WALTER 
SMITH IS CURRENTLY RIDING HIGH WITH 
RANGERS AT THE TOP OF THE LEAGUE 
AND STILL IN WITH SHOUT FOR THE 
AIKWOOD REPORT IT IS HIS SECOND 
TIME AROUND WITH RANGERS HE SPENT 
A LESS SUCCESSFUL PERIOD AT EVERTON 
WHERE HE WAS SACKED HE TURNED THE 
SCOTTISH NATIONAL TEAM ROUND HE IS 
THE ONLY MANAGER TO SIGN GAZZA 
TWICE I WENT TO GLASGOW TO MEET 
HIM AND ALLY MCCOIST THEY ARE 
EIGHT DOUBLE ACT TO BE RECKONED 
WITH 
YOU ARE WORKING AGAIN WITH ALLY 
MCCOIST WHEN YOU EMPLOYED HIM FOR 
SCOTLAND THERE WAS FEELING THAT 
YOU WERE SERIOUS AND ALLY MCCOIST 
WOULD BE A CHEEKY CHAPPIE 
ENTERTAINING THE TROOPS 
I THINK 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HE HIMSELF 
HAS TO GET OVER ONCE YOU GET TO 
KNOW HIM YOU REALISE THAT IS NOT 
ALL THERE IS THERE YOU COULD NOT 
BLAME ANYONE FROM THE OUTSIDE FOR 
THINKING THAT THERE IS AN AGE TO 
HIM THAT IS IMPORTANT IT IS WHAT 
HE WANTS TO DO 
AND A MCCOIST HAS A 
DESK IS THIS THE FIRST DESK YOU 
HAVE HAD ALLY MCCOIST CERTAINLY CERTAINLY MY FIRST DESK WITHOUT SCHOOL IT IS 
MY FIRST DESK WITHOUT GRAFFITI 
THAT CAN BE ARRANGED 
WHY DO YOU 
THINK YOU'RE PARTNERSHIP WORKS SO 
WELL 
I DO NOT KNOW THE ONE THING WELL I WOULD SAY HOPE FOR ME I KNOW MY 
PLACE THAT BASICALLY IS TO GIVE MY 
OPINION AND BASICALLY WATCH AND 
LEARN THERE IS A BALANCE THAT HAS 
TO BE STRUCK HE DOES NOT WANT 
SOMEONE TO NOT HAVE AND AGREE WITH 
EVERYTHING HE SAYS AND DOES THAT 
IS NOT THE CASE 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
SPREAD YOUR WINGS ONE DAY 
YOU KNOW 
IT WOULD NOT BREAK MY HEART IF I 
WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO STAY HERE 
I PLAYED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS HERE DO YOU 
KNOW SOMETHING I NEVER WENT TO 
EUROPE 
YOU HAVE GOT TO TIDY YOUR EUROPE DESK UP DO YOU MIND 
I WILL KEEP 
THIS THE WAY FROM KENNY HE ONLY 
GOT LAST YEAR'S MODEL IT IS A 
PLEASURE LOVELY TO SEE YOU 
RANGERS HAVE WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
CHAMPIONSHIP TROPHY TO RANGERS IT 
SEEMS TO GET SWEETER ALL THE TIME 
NINE IN A ROW IN THAT PERIOD YOU 
MUST HAVE BEEN COURTED FROM CLUBS 
SOUTH AND PERHAPS THE REST OF 
EUROPE WHAT MADE YOU STAY 
TO BE 
HONEST I NEVER FELT LIKE LEAVING 
RANGERS WE NEVER THOUGHT OF 
CELTIC'S ACHIEVEMENT OF NINE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS IT WAS THE FIRST 
REAL MANAGERIAL JOB WHEN IT WAS 
SIX AND SEVEN YOU STARTED TO SAY 
TO YOURSELF THERE WAS A 
POSSIBILITY ABOUT CELTIC'S 
ACHIEVEMENT 
GOING BACK TO SCOTLAND ACHIEVEMENT AND THE THRILL OF TAKING OVER THE 
NATIONAL TEAM IN THAT TIME THAT 
YOU DID DID YOU REALISE HE HAD A 
GROUP OF PLAYERS WHO COULD PRODUCE 
THE RESULTS THAT THEY WERE DOING 
SCOTLAND HAD GONE THROUGH PERIOD 
THE PREVIOUS MANAGER HAD TAKEN A 
GREAT DEAL OF CRITICISM WHEN THIRTY 
VOTES CAME IN COLOUR HE TRIED 
BERTIE WOGTS WHEN I CAME IN IT 
WAS EASIER FOR ME TO GO BACK TO 
PLAYERS SCOTLAND HAD REASONABLE 
RUN AT THAT TIME 
THAT INCLUDED A 
RESULT WHICH YOU SAID WAS ONE OF 
THE GREATEST OF YOUR CAREER 
AGAINST FRANCE 
I KNEW WE WERE 
GOING TO BE FULLY TESTED THEY GAVE 
US A TOUGH TIME WE MANAGED TO HOLD 
OUT WE WON THE GAME 
SCOTLAND ONE 
FRANCE ZERO THANK YOU WALTER SMITH 
THAT 
WAS TREMENDOUS RESULT IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST RESULTS I HAVE 
HAD IN MY CAREER 
THE ATTRACTIONS 
OF CLUB PROVED GREATER THAN COUNTRY 
FOR WALTER SMITH 
IT IS A 
DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN YOU HAVE TO 
MAKE A DECISION TO LEAVE THIS THIS RANGES THING IS SOMETHING I DO NOT 
THINK HE COULD RESIST RANGERS I I THINK THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONLY 
JOB I WOULD HAVE LEFT THE SCOTLAND 
JOB FOR IT WAS COMING IN THE MIDST 
OF A SECTION WHERE SCOTLAND HAD 
STARTED WELL OBVIOUSLY I WON'T 
HAVE MUCH PREFERRED IT TO BE AT A 
LATER STAGE I WOULD HAVE MUCH 
PREFERRED AS A MANAGER WHO HAS 
BEEN SACKED FROM ONE JOB YOU 
BECOME A BIT BIT CYNICAL L. THOUGHT 
I WOULD DO WHAT I FELT BEST FOR 
MYSELF 
DO YOU THINK HAD HE NOT MYSELF HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING SACKED 
AT EVERTON YOU MAY HAVE STUCK IT 
OUT 
MAYBE IT DID COME INTO MY OUT MIND AT THAT TIME YOU SAY TO 
YOURSELF YOU ARE IN ANY JOB AT THE 
PRESENT MOMENT HOW LONG WILL IT 
LAST 
WHAT YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR TIME LAST AT EVERTON WHAT DO YOU FEEL I I PICKED THE BRIGHT CLUB AT THE WRONG 
TIME THERE WERE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS 
ALL OF A SUDDEN DUNCAN FERGUSON 
WAS SOLD WITHOUT TELLING ME AFTER 
THAT THEY PUT THE CLUB UP FOR SALE 
AS MANAGERS WE'D TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE TO HANDLE 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES L. DID NOT HANDLE 
THEM PROPERLY AT THAT TIME YOU YOU GAVE PAUL GASCOIGNE ANOTHER CHANCE 
SADLY HE HAS BEEN SECTIONED UNDER 
THE MENTAL HEALTH ACT HE IS NOT 
GOING THROUGH THE BEST PERIOD OF 
HIS LIFE YOU SEEMED TO KNOW HOW TO 
GET THE BEST OUT OF GAZZA 
I THINK 
THAT WAS IN GASSER'S PRIZE 
GAZZA'S EYES L. THINK MOST OF US 
WHO KNOW HIM WOULD HAVE HAD FAIR 
IDEA THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD 
HAPPEN TO HIM HE WAS ALWAYS GOING 
TO HAVE IT PROBLEM ADJUSTING TO NOT 
BEING GAZZA OR THE FOOTBALLER HE 
HAD A GENIUS AT PLAYING IT IS UP 
TO YOU TO LIVE WITH THE GENIUS 
GAZZA EARTH WAS NEVER INTERESTED IN 
TACTICS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
GAZZA IF YOU PUT HIM IN A POSITION 
WHERE HE COULD GET THE BALL THAT 
IS ALL HE WANTED SCOTTISH PEOPLE 
LIKE THAT IN THE FIRST PERIOD OF 
TIME IT WAS GOOD TO GET PLAYERS 
LIKE PAUL GASCOIGNE NOW WE ARE NOT 
ABLE TO DO THAT IN THE MANNER WE 
DID BEFORE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT 
OTHER WAYS OF TRYING TO WIN WE 
HAVE BEEN DOING EXCEPTIONALLY WELL 
YOU HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THAT YOU YOU WERE SENT RECENT LEAKED TO THE 
STAND YOU STILL CANNOT QUITE KEEP 
YOUR COOL 
I GOT EXCITED L. HAVE 
ALWAYS BEEN QUITE COMPETITIVE L. 
WAS QUITE PLEASED WITH MYSELF L. 
GOT ANGRY THE OTHER WEEK L. THOUGHT 
THOSE DAYS WERE OVER WHEN IT 
HAPPENS IT HAPPENS IT IS STILL 
THERE YOU WANT TO I WANT TO 
WIN IF I PLAY GOLF OR ANYTHING I'D 
JUST LIKE WINNING THAT COMES OVER 
THEY ARE WINNING THEY ARE STILL 
COMPETITIVE ON FOUR FRANCE NEVER 
ENOUGH FOR THE SCOTTISH PRESS 
NEVER ENOUGH IT WILL NEVER BE 
ENOUGH FOR THE SCOTTISH PRESS WHAT 
I LIKE ABOUT WALTER SMITH IF THAT 
WERE A BLACK AND WHITE FILM HE 
LOOKS LIKE A MANAGER FROM THE FORTIES 
IF YOU DID NOT KNOWN WHO HE WAS BUT 
YOU KNEW YOUR FOOTBALL YOU WOULD 
SAY HE IS A SCOTTISH FOOTBALL 
MANAGER HE HAS THAT LOOK ABOUT HIM 
HE IS A VERY GOOD MANAGER ANY 
DOUBTS ABOUT HIS PERFORMANCE IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE ARE ERADICATED BY 
WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR SCOTLAND SHE SHE IS CYCLING'S QUEEN VICTORIA AND A 
REAL MEDAL HELP FOR THE OLYMPICS 
HOPE SHE WANTS TO BREAK THE WORLD 
SPRINT RECORD IN BEIJING SHE SAYS 
SHE IS LIKE ANY OTHER ORDINARY GIRL 
SHE HAS BEEN TALKING TO MATTHEW 
PINSENT 
ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS TO PINSENT BE REALLY GOOD AT SOMETHING L. AM 
AN EMOTIONAL FEE NOW THERE IS NO 
GETTING AWAY FROM THE FACT 
FEMALE I DID NOT DO IT BECAUSE I 
WANTED TO BE FAMOUS OR A 
PERSONALITY I DID IT BECAUSE I

MADE IT LOOK SO EASY HAVING HAVING SECURED A THIRD WORLD TITLE IN THE 
SPRINT SHE HAD A NEW BRITISH 
IN THE PROCESS WAS THAT SHE 
HAS SET HER SIGHTS FIRMLY ON 
BEIJING IN THE PROCESS 
DOES THE 
IDEA OF AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL GET 
THE HAIRS ON THE BACK OF YOUR NEXT 
STANDING UP 
ABSOLUTELY DO NOT 
LIKE THINKING ABOUT IT TOO MUCH 
BECAUSE IT IS MORE THAN I CAN DEAL 
WITH 
DEAL WITH IT SHE WILL HAVE TO WITH VICTORIA PENDLETON HIS DAD AT THE 
QUARTER FINAL STAGE OF THE SPRINT 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
I FELT A FAILURE L. FELT I 
HAD FELT MYSELF EVERYONE WAS 
DISAPPOINTED THAT WAS RIDICULOUS 
THAT WAS THE WAY I FELT AT THE TIME 
I DO NOT KNOW WHERE I HAVE GOT THIS 
INFERIORITY THINK THAT I HAVE TO 
PROVE THAT I AM TALENTED L. DID NOT 
CARE WHAT TIN WHETHER IT WAS IN 
SCHOOL ACADEMIC ARTISTIC OR 
SPORTY WHAT IN L. FELT I HAD TO BE GOOD AT SOMETHING WHERE

I DO NOT KNOW HOPEFULLY 
WHEN YOU WIN AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL

AND INVOLVED A LOT OF STANDING 
AROUND 
THE PAST FOUR YEARS HAVE AROUND BEEN A LONG PERSONAL JOURNEY FOR 
VICTORIA DESPITE HER SUCCESS ON 
THE STAGE THE MENTAL DEMANDS OF 
HER SPORT DO NOT COME INSTINCTIVELY 
TO HER

STREAK 
SPRINTING IS ABOUT STREAK CONFIDENCE IF YOU DO NOT THINK YOU

ABLE TO 
SOMETIMES SOME DAYS I 
SEE THINGS FROM THE WRONG ANGLE L. 
TAKE IT VERY PERSONALLY STOP 
STOP SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO COACH

PEOPLE I NEED SOMEONE THERE TO 
GUIDE ME THROUGH FOCUS 
HE HAS ALL FOCUS THE THINGS I NEED IN HIS REPERTOIRE 
THAT I NEED TO BE THE BEST IN THE 
WORLD THEY ARE THE THINGS I LACKED 
MOST MEDALS TO FEEL LIKE RELIEF 
RATHER THAN ABSOLUTE OVERWHELMING 
JOY ABOUT HAVING ACHIEVED SOMETHING 
IT IS LIKE GOT IT RIGHT THANK GOODNESS IT IS GREAT DECEIT GOODNESS VICTORIA ON THE SHOW SHE SHOULD BE 
A KIND OF ROLE MODEL WE SHOULD SEEK 
IN THIS COUNTRY 
IF ANY YOUNG GIRLS 
WATCHED OR WATCHING IT ON TUESDAY 
THEY WILL SEE A GIRL WHO SOMETIMES 
LOOKS SIXTEEN AND OTHER TIMES SHE LOOKS 
LIKE A GROWN UP WOMAN SHE IS 
LAUGHING AND NORMAL 
THAT HAS 
CONFUSED TO 
IT HAS GIRLS AROUND 
THE COUNTRY WILL TURN TO THEIR MUMS 
AND SAY SHE IS HAVING FUN YOU ARE 
RIGHT THAT IS WHAT WILL COME 
ACROSS 
STEVE CANNOT UNDERSTAND SHE ACROSS IS DRIVEN WHEN ON THE BIKE AND WHEN 
SHE IS OF SHE HAS FUN YOU SEEM TO 
THINK THEY MUST BE HEADS DOWN 
BACKSIDE UP ALL THE TIME GOING FOR

PERHAPS I AM TOO OLD SCHOOL IT IT WAS A FANTASTIC PIECE MATTHEW AS 
ALWAYS HAS THE BEST OUT OF A 
FELLOW ATHLETE EVEN WITH THE 
D. W. A. Y. N. E. HE GOT FANTASTIC STUFF HE 
HAS GONE IN THERE AND SAT DOWN WITH 
HER AND GOT FANTASTIC STUFF 
HE HAS

PEOPLE ARE NOT THEMSELVES WHEN THE 
CAMERA COMES ON MATTHEW HAS 
CAPTURED THAT WHAT AN INSPIRATION 
THREE 
WORLD TITLES THREE TIMES WORLD CHAMPION IN BEIJING GOING 
INTO BEIJING SHE IS FAVOURITE 
WE HAVE SEEN SOME INCREDIBLE SCENES 
STARTING YESTERDAY IN LONDON THE 
TORCH RELAY WHAT ELSE DID WE 
EXPECT 
I DIDN'T EXPECT WHAT WE GOT EXPECT IT WAS THE MOST BIZARRE SPORTING 
SPECTACLE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THIS 
COUNTRY I TURNED IT ALL AND NOT 
KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT THE BLUE 
SUITED CHINESE GUARDS THE 
POLICEMAN IN CYCLING HELMETS IF IT 
WAS NOT SO SERIOUS IT WOULD BE 
LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF IT'S A 
KNOCKOUT 
THE THING THAT STRUCK ME KNOCKOUT WAS THE HELICOPTER SHOTS IT DID 
HAVE A KEYSTONE COP FEEL TO IT L. 
KNOW WE SHOULD NOT MAKE LIGHT OF IT 
ONE OR TWO PEOPLE WERE ASSAULTED A 
LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE PUSHED 
ASIDE GOT LEFT IT IS LIKE THEY 
WERE RUGBY TACKLED AND PLAY 
CONTINUED 
I KNOW PEOPLE WHO WERE CONTINUED PART OF THE POSSESSION I WENT 
THERE MYSELF AND WATCHED IT FOR 
THE MOST PART IT WAS A PEACEFUL 
PROTEST THE POLICE APPEAR TO BE 
HANDLING IT WELL IT SEEMED TO BE 
THE GENERAL FEELING FROM THE PEOPLE 
DOWN THERE THAT THIS IS WHAT IT IS 
ABOUT PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO AN 
OPINION 
THE PROBLEM IS AND WHY OPINION THE TORCH BEARERS WERE EMBARRASSED 
SUMMER HAS TAKEN THEIR FINGER OUT 
OF THE DAM AND THE SCENES IN FRANCE 
SHOWED THERE IS BLOOD ON THE 
STREETS THE TORCH HAD TO BE PUT UP 
TWO OR THREE TIMES 
THE FRENCH 
HANDLE IT DIFFERENTLY THEY STOPPED 
THE TORCH AND CHANGE THE POSSESSION 
POSSESSION PROCESSION THE THE CHINESE HAVE SAID THEY ARE 
DETERMINED TO TAKE THE TORCH 
THROUGH TIBET TO MOUNT EVEREST I I DO NOT KNOW WHY WE ARE SURPRISED 
THE FRENCH HANDLE IT TIFFANY THE 
MAN IN CHARGE WHEN INTERIOR 
MINISTER SAID RIOT POLICE INTO THE 
SUBURBS NIGHT AFTER NIGHT SENT
