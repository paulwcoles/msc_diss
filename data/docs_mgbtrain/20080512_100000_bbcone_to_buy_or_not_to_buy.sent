ONE OF WHICH YOU TRY BEFORE YOU BUY 
FREEHOLDS LEASEHOLDS SURVEYS IT IS ENOUGH TO SEND YOU INTO MELTDOWN WHEN YOU WANT YOUR NEXT DREAM HOME 
BUYING A HOUSE IS THE SECOND MOST STRESSFUL THING YOU CAN DO ASIDE FROM WORKING WITH DOMINIC 
ONE FOUL MANOEUVRE COULD SEND YOU DOWN THE WRONG CUL DE S. A. C. THINK OF US AS HOUSING SUPERHEROES 
YOUR CRUSADERS OF CONTRACTS THANK YOU I THINK WE GET THE IDEA 
WE'LL HELP YOU FIND A DREAM HOME AND WE GET GOOD RESULTS COME ON 
MEET NIGEL AND MICHELLE AND KIDS DAN MAX MACY GRACE AND TRULY 
THEY'VE LIVED IN THIS FOUR BED HOUSE IN NORTHFIELD FOR FIVE YEARS 
THEY'VE SOLD IT FOR A FAIR PROFIT AND WANT TO BUY A NEW FAMILY HOME 
AND AN INVESTMENT PROPERTY TO DO UP 
NIGEL RUNS A CLEANING BUSINESS AND IS A DIY DEMON 
MICHELLE'S A TEACHER AND TUTORS THEIR FOUR KIDS AT HOME 
KRIS AND I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS PROGRAMME FOR FOUR YEARS YEAH 
NEVER BEFORE HAVE WE MET SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS TO MOVE SO DESPERATELY QUICKLY AS YOU 
WE'VE SOLD THE HOUSE TO THE METHODIST CHURCH SO THEY'RE CASH BUYERS NO CHAIN 
THEY'D LIKE US OUT WITHIN THE WEEK AND YOU'VE GOT FOUR CHILDREN YOU'RE GONNA BE HOMELESS 
HAVE YOU BEEN HOMELESS BEFORE YEAH YOU'RE AN OLD HAND AT IT 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO MOVE YOU HAVE A NICE HOUSE LOVELY WIFE FOUR KIDS 
WE WANT TO DOWNSIZE THE HOUSE SO WE CAN TAKE SOME EQUITY OUT BUY A SECOND PROPERTY WE CAN DO UP 
A DOER UPPER YEAH YOU WANT TWO HOUSES YOU'VE BOUGHT THE OTHER ONE YEAH THE ONE TO DO UP 
THE SPACE FOR YOU TO LIVE IN HAS YET TO BE FOUND 
LET'S SPLIT THEM UP AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY WANT INDIVIDUALLY 
MICHELLE LET'S DISAPPEAR THIS WAY I'LL CHAT TO YOU CAN I SIT UP THERE YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU WANT THREE BEDROOMS 
WHICH AREAS ARE YOU KEEN ON WE NARROWED IT DOWN TO A CATCHMENT AREA 
FOR A REALLY GOOD SCHOOL IN SUTTON AND WE COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING THERE 
MY NEXT CHOICE WAS HAGLEY 
THE KIDS HAVE BEEN HOME SCHOOLED WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SCHOOLS SO YEAH CATCHMENT IS IMPORTANT 
I WOULD LIKE TWO RECEPTION ROOMS AND A LARGE KITCHEN 
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU'VE GOT YEAH AND WE'RE DOWNSIZING HERE YEAH 
WHAT DOES MICHELLE WANT THAT YOU DON'T COLOUR I LIKE MAGNOLIA JUST DECOR 
A GARAGE WOULD BE GOOD WE HAVE LOTS OF BIKES AND KIDS' TOYS TO STORE 
OFF STREET PARKING I WOULD PREFER IT'S NOT ESSENTIAL 
A GARDEN IS ESSENTIAL 
IT MUST HAVE A SOUTH FACING GARDEN WHY MY PREVIOUS HOME WAS SOUTH FACING THIS IS NORTH FACING 
I REALLY DON'T LIKE IT YOU REALLY DON'T LIKE IT IT'S AFFECTED ME 
WOULD YOU LOOK AT SOMEWHERE THAT WAS A SHELL AND START FROM SCRATCH YEAH I WOULDN'T BE FAZED BY THAT 
ONE FINAL QUESTION HOW MUCH CAN YOU SPEND 
WELL TWO HUNDRED FIFTY IS OUR MAXIMUM BUDGET 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY IS A GOOD SIZE BUDGET BUT FOR A SOUTH FACING GARDEN THOSE BEDROOMS ALL THE RECEPTION ROOMS 
WHAT AM I GONNA DO LOOK HARD I'LL SEE YOU LATER ENJOY THE GARDEN IN THE SHADE 
AFTER THAT CONVERSATION I FEEL A BIT LIKE TOM CRUISE 
YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS MISSION IMPOSSIBLE IT IS YOU JUST HEARD THAT CONVERSATION 
YEAH BUT YOU ARE NOTHING LIKE TOM CRUISE MORE LIKE PENELOPE CRUZ 
NO NEED FOR THAT I WAS WATCHING AN ACTION FILM AND YOU SPRANG TO MIND THE BULLDOG BITES BACK 
ALMOST I'LL GIVE YOU A CLUE GO ON MINI MAINE PATHETIC 
ONE OF NIGEL AND MICHELLE'S PREFERRED LOCATIONS IS HAGLEY A NICE VILLAGE NEAR BIRMINGHAM 
IT'S POPULAR AS THE SCHOOLS HAVE A GOLD STAR REPUTATION 
HAGLEY IS A SMALL COMMUNITY BUT A SHORT CAR RIDE AWAY IS BLAKEDOWN 
WHICH STILL FALLS INTO THEIR CHOSEN SCHOOL CATCHMENT AREAS 
HOUSE PRICES VARY BUT YOU PAY A PREMIUM TO BE NEARER THE COUNTRYSIDE AND OFF THE MAIN ROAD 
ALSO MICHELLE AND NIGEL SHOULDN'T ASSUME THEIR LITTLE DARLINGS WILL GET INTO HAGLEY'S SCHOOLS 
AS DECISIONS ARE MADE ON A ROAD BY ROAD BASIS 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ISN'T A KING'S RANSOM HERE BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE U. K. 
ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT IT WILL GET YOU A THREE BEDROOM DETACHED HOUSE OPEN PLAN 
WASHING MACHINE AND WARDROBES THROWN IN 
HOW ABOUT THIS COTTAGE IN EASTHAM 
THREE BEDROOMS THREE RECEPTION ROOMS AND A THIRD OF AN ACRE 
FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SPOT ON 
YOU MIGHT PREFER THIS VICTORIAN TERRACE IN DISLEY 
TWO RECEPTION ROOMS GARDENS FRONT AND BACK AND BASEMENT FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
MARVELLOUS BUT OUR HOUSE HUNT IS IN HAGLEY 
GOOD DAY I KNOW WHO YOU ARE DOMINIC EH I'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE FACES 
HAGLEY'S MEANT TO BE LOVELY WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT HAGLEY 
IT'S A NICE VILLAGE NICE PEOPLE 
I'M LOOKING FOR A HOUSE I'VE GOT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THREE BEDS MINIMUM O. K. 
DOUBLE BEDS IF POSSIBLE BECAUSE THIS FAMILY HAVE GOT FOUR CHILDREN YOU DID SAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
VERY VERY VERY GOOD SCHOOLS THEY WANT A BIG GARDEN AND A PERIOD PROPERTY IDEAL LOCATION HAGLEY 
HAGLEY LOVELY AREA VERY NICE NICE PEOPLE DEFINITELY 
YOU SAID YOU WANTED PERIOD YEAH THERE'S NOT MANY AT THAT PRICE 
YOU'RE LOOKING A LOT HIGHER THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT TO HEAR 
PERIOD HOUSE FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND NOT IN HAGLEY 
YOU COULD PROBABLY LOOK AT A TERRACED PROPERTY O. K. 
MAYBE THAT SORT OF THING OH I LIKE THAT VICTORIAN 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN HAGLEY WHAT DO WE ALL THINK NO CHANCE 
DO YOU HEAR THIS YOU'LL GET A FLAT NOT A FLAT I WANT A HOUSE 
I LIKE THAT I WASN'T EXPECTING TO SEE THAT THERE 
CAN I STEAL THIS YEAH THERE'S HAGLEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'VE BEEN A HELP 
YOU NEED TO HAVE A LOOK AT IT YOU'VE TALKED ME INTO IT I'LL LOOK AT THAT ONE 
AH HELLO YES I'M NOT IN HAGLEY ANY MORE 
I'VE POPPED IN A TRAIN AND LEFT HAGLEY BY ABOUT TWENTY MILES TO FIND MICHELLE AND NIGEL'S DREAM LOCATION 
BECAUSE I HAVE A CUNNING PLAN UP MY SLEEVES 
I'M IN SUTTON COLDFIELD WHICH IS MICHELLE AND NIGEL'S NUMBER ONE LOCATION CHOICE 
THEY LOVE THE SCHOOLS BUT COULDN'T FIND A HOUSE THEY LIKED SO I'LL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK 
IT'S BEEN TOUGH BUT WE'VE BEEN POUNDING PAVEMENTS AND WE'VE FOUND SOME NICE PROPERTIES 
I'VE BEEN POUNDING PAVEMENTS YOU'VE BEEN GOSSIPING 
IT'S A WAY OF FINDING INFORMATION MAYBE BUT IT'S NOT POUNDING THE PAVEMENTS WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND 
THE FIRST HOUSE IS OUR THE ONE WE BOTH LIKE OUR JOINT CHOICE 
IT'S QUITE NICE A BIT QUIRKY BUT IT'S IN THE LOCATION THEY WANT 
BUT THE SECOND ONE IS MY FAVOURITE 
IT HAS EVERYTHING THEY WANT DON'T BE PUT OFF BY THE OUTSIDE PICTURE 
HELLO DOMINIC LITTLEWOOD JUST LOOK AT THE GARDEN YOU'VE GIVEN ME A HEADACHE 
WHAT DIRECTION IS THAT FACING JUDGING BY THE SHADOWS 
THERE'S SUNSHINE IN THAT GARDEN THEY WANTED A SUNNY GARDEN A SUNNY GARDEN IT'S SIMPLE 
THEY'LL LIKE IT I'VE BEEN A BIT DEVIOUS NOTHING NEW THERE THEN 
UP MY SLEEVE I HAVE THE WILD CARD THIS IS MY CHOICE 
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PERIOD GEM 
THIS IS THE ONE YOU WOULDN'T SHOW ME EARLIER HANG ON 
POSTCODE WHAT DOES THAT SAY THAT IS THEIR MOST DESIRED LOCATION ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE 
B. SEVENTY FOUR SUTTON COLDFIELD THEY WANTED TO LIVE IN HAGLEY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT MY LITTLE MAP I DON'T NEED THIS ILLUSTRATING 
THERE IS HAGLEY AND YOU'VE BEEN TO SUTTON COLDFIELD WELL DONE 
YOU'LL SEE FIRST IT'S PROPERTY ONE OUR JOINT CHOICE 
A THREE BED SEMI SLAP BANG IN THE HEART OF ROMSLEY JUST TWO MINUTES FROM HAGLEY 
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM DOWNSTAIRS AND OUT BACK AND THE KITCHEN'S JUST BEEN DONE 
THE NEW BATHROOM GETS TOP MARKS AND THERE'S A BIT OF A SURPRISE UP THERE IN THE ROOF 
MICHELLE AND NIGEL DOMINIC AND I ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS 
THIS ISN'T AN EASY PROPERTY HUNT LIKE SWIMMING WITH YOUR BOOTS ON 
BECAUSE I HEAR THAT IT TOOK NIGEL TEN YEARS PROPOSING EVERY YEAR TO CONVINCE YOU TO MARRY HIM 
TEN YEARS OF PROPOSING AND YOU SAID NO 
HOW HARD IS IT GONNA BE TO GET YOU TO LIKE A HOUSE WELL LET'S SEE 
GOT A DECADE FREE DOM I'LL GET SOME CHAIRS KRIS 
OUR JOINT CHOICE IS VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT YOU'VE BEEN LIVING IN 
IT'S A GREAT HOUSE GREAT DECOR ALL THE SPACE YOU WANT AND IT'S GOT A SOUTH FACING GARDEN WELL DONE 
WILL YOU TAKE THIS HOUSE WHY ARE YOU DOWN ON ONE KNEE IT'S A HOUSE PROPOSAL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT LOOKS TIDY THE SUN'S AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
IT'S BEHIND THE CLOUDS BUT IT IS ON ITS WAY OUT 
WE'RE IN THE CATCHMENT AREA FOR HAYBRIDGE SCHOOL THAT WAS IMPORTANT YEAH 
GET INSIDE AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK ENJOY IT TEN YEARS YES 
I'VE WAITED FIFTEEN ON ONE WOMAN REALLY YOU DON'T LOOK OLD ENOUGH THANKS 
LET'S SEE IF IT'S A BREEZE OR THE START OF TEN YEARS OF HOUSE HUNTING PURGATORY DON'T SAY THAT 
IT'S NOT AS SMALL AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NO 
THE HOUSE IS MUCH LONGER THAN YOU EXPECT 
IT'S ALREADY GOT COVING WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT 
THIS IS JUST AN EXTENSION ISN'T IT 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT WHAT'S SHE EXPECTING AN AIRCRAFT HANGAR 
THIS IS A GOOD SIZE ROOM IF THIS IS ON THE BACK AND ANOTHER ROOM WAS HERE THAT WOULD BE BETTER 
THIS HOUSE NEEDS HARDLY ANY WORK BUT IS THAT A DOWNER FOR HIM 
MODERN YEAH 
IT'S TIDY ACTUALLY IT IS QUITE NICE AND TIDY 
THE TABLE'S A BIT SMALL IF WE COULD FIT A BIGGER TABLE IN 
THEY'RE BUYING THE SPACE THE TABLE SITS IN 
I WOULDN'T WANT SIX OF US IN HERE 
I DO LIKE THE TILES ACTUALLY 
I LIKE THEM VERY MODERN 
SO THIS IS PROBABLY A REALLY GOOD USE OF SPACE FOR THEM BUT FOR US WITH THE CHILDREN 
I WOULD PREFER TO OPEN IT ALL OUT INTO ONE SEEMS A BIT WASTED TO ME 
MICHELLE'S BECOME AN ARCHITECT HE DOES ALL THE DECORATING SHE GOES I WANT THIS DONE THAT DONE 
SUN COMING INTO THE BACK OF THE GARDEN 
I HARDLY FEEL LIKE WHIPPING OUT THE FACTOR TWENTY REMOVE THE CLOUDS AND IT'S NOT COSTA DEL SOL IS IT 
NOT A LOT OF SPACE FOR THE KIDS TO PLAY FOOTBALL NO 
WE COULD GET RID OF THE POND AND CLEAR ALL THE SHRUBS AND TREES AND OPEN IT ALL OUT 
THE WHOLE HOUSE NEEDS OPENING OUT 
IT'S OUR FAULT FOR GETTING A GARDEN WITH TREES AND SHRUBS 
NO THEY WANT A FIELD WE'VE BEEN SO REMISS 
NICE STAIRWAY COS IT'S NOT JUST STRAIGHT UP THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED FOR THE UPSTAIRS I'M CROSSING MY FINGERS AND MY LEGS 
DECENT SIZE DECENT SIZE YEAH 
NOVEL DECOR ON THE WALL 
UNUSUAL DECORATION I THINK 
IT LOOKS A DECENT SIZE BUT THERE'S NO STORAGE AT ALL NO WARDROBES 
HE'S A BUILDER A DECORATOR WHAT'S TO STOP HIM GETTING A FLAT PACK AND ASSEMBLING IT 
ONE OF THOSE SCREWS IS ALWAYS MISSING 
OH LOOK THAT'S WHY THEY USE THE THIRD BEDROOM AS A DRESSING ROOM YEAH 
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD EXTEND ON TOP OF THAT EXTENSION ALREADY 
GO DOWNSTAIRS POSSIBLY YEAH 
IF YOU COULD EXTEND BOTH OF THE ROOMS THEY WOULD BE A DECENT SIZE 
WE'D HAVE TO LOOK AT BUDGET AND SEE HOW MUCH IT COSTS 
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT WERE WE NOT LOOKING TO DOWNSIZE 
I REMEMBER THE WORD DOWNSIZE WHAT HAVE WE DONE WITH THIS HOUSE 
AND LAST THE BATHROOM OH 
AGAIN IT'S TIDY IT'S JUST DEFINITELY NOT TO MY TASTE 
IT'S A NICE TIDY HOUSE FOR TWO IDEAL 
IT'S TOO SMALL FOR US YEAH AS IT STANDS MUCH TOO SMALL 
THAT HOUSE IS PERFECT FOR THEM BUT THEY CANNOT SEE THE WOOD FOR THE TREES 
SHALL WE CUT SOME TREES DOWN YEAH 
NIGEL THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH DOWNSIZING SO FAR SEEMS TO BE SPACE I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE 
BUT THERE IS POTENTIAL IN THIS PROPERTY TO EXTEND HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY 
NOW THIS AS YOU WELL KNOW IS A LOFT LADDER I WANT YOU TO EXPLORE 
IT'S ALL YOURS GO UP THERE AND SEE WHAT YOU FIND YOU DON'T SUFFER FROM ALTITUDE SICKNESS NO 
TELL ME WHAT YOU CAN SEE IT'S FULLY BOARDED OUT 
IT'S GOT A LIGHT IN IT'S GOOD USE OF SPACE 
IF IT'S FULL HEIGHT OR NOT I'M NOT SURE WITHOUT STANDING UP 
COULD IT BE USED AS A SCHOOL ROOM OR STORAGE THERE'S POSSIBILITIES 
YEAH YEAH IT NEEDS A WINDOW DOES IT 
I WOULDN'T LIKE TO HAVE THE CHILDREN UP HERE WITHOUT A BIT OF DAYLIGHT STAY WHERE YOU ARE 
OUT THE BACK YOU'VE GOT THE GARAGE AND THE EXTENSION 
THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE THERE TO BUILD UP A FLOOR FOR ANOTHER BEDROOM EN SUITE WHATEVER 
WITH THE ATTIC AND THAT SPACE THERE HAVE WE GOT THE SPACE YEAH BUT IT'S THE BUDGET 
MICHELLE YOU HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE INTERIOR SPACE 
YEAH AND THE GARDEN FOR THE KIDS PLAYING FOOTBALL 
THE ANSWER IS CLOSER THAN YOU THINK COME WITH ME RUN RUN RUN 
I CAUGHT MY HEAD ON THAT BUSH THEN 
I'VE BROUGHT YOU INTO THE NEIGHBOUR'S HOUSE TO SHOW YOU WHAT YOU COULD DO 
THIS IS A MIRROR IMAGE OF THAT ONE IT'S LOVELY TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
THERE USED TO BE A WALL THERE TAKEN DOWN A WALL HERE TAKEN DOWN 
NEXT DOOR THAT WAS THE UTILITY AREA IT'S BEEN OPENED UP 
THE UTILITY AREA IS BEHIND THAT PLASTERBOARD IT'S A BETTER DESIGNED ROOM YEAH 
MUCH BETTER USE OF SPACE WHICH IS WHAT I SAID OVER THERE 
TO HAVE A LARGER TABLE WE NEED MORE SPACE 
THIS WILL SORT YOUR PROBLEMS OUT YEAH IT COST THIRTY THOUSAND 
TWELVE THOUSAND WAS THE KITCHEN UTENSILS SO THERE'S EIGHTEEN GRAND'S WORTH OF WORK 
BUT THESE PEOPLE HAD A PROFESSIONAL BUILDING TEAM IN TO DO IT 
NIGEL CAN DO A LOT OF THIS HIMSELF SO YOU CAN CUT THOSE COSTS DOWN 
JUST LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW THERE SEE THAT GARDEN YEAH 
SAME SIZE AS YOUR GARDEN LOOKS MUCH BIGGER IT'S A FOOTBALL PITCH 
MUCH BETTER OPEN FOR THE BOYS YEAH AND IT'S GOT THE SUN COMING IN THE TREES AREN'T OBSCURING IT 
YOU'RE DOING MY JOB FOR ME THE SUN HAS GOT HIS HAT ON HIP HIP HIP HOORAY LET'S GUESS THE PRICE 
NIGEL SMILING FACES ALL ROUND I'VE JUST MADE A WOMAN VERY HAPPY 
HAVE YOU NOT AS HAPPY AS NIGEL MAKES ME I HOPE NOT 
IT'S GUESS THE PRICE TIME EVERY TIME WE SHOW YOU A PROPERTY WE WANT YOU TO GUESS ITS VALUE 
YOU'VE THROWN YOUR EYEBALLS ROUND THIS ONE NIGEL YOU GO FIRST 
TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN MICHELLE 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YOU'RE CLOSEST ON THIS ONE BUT YOU'RE BOTH UNDER 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WE THOUGHT THAT WAS GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY 
LEAVING YOU TWENTY THOUSAND TO DO ANYTHING YOU WANT INSIDE HOW DO YOU FEEL 
BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE WORK ON THE HOUSE ALREADY 
I WOULD FEEL A BIT LOATH TO SPEND MONEY RIPPING IT OUT AND RE DOING WHAT I WANTED TO DO O. K. 
SHALL WE COMPROMISE IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS WE'RE GOING TO COS IT'S DOMINIC'S CHOICE FOLLOW ME 
ALTHOUGH NIGEL WOULD PROBABLY CONVERT THE ATTIC HIMSELF 
HE WOULD NEED BUILDING REGULATION APPROVAL FIRST 
PROPERTY TWO IS MY CHOICE AND IT ROCKS 
CHECK OUT THIS THREE BED TERRACED COTTAGE IN THE GORGEOUS VILLAGE OF BLAKEDOWN FIVE MINUTES FROM HAGLEY 
SUBLIME PRESENTATION AND VERY WELL APPOINTED IT MAY BE 
BUT MICHELLE WILL FORGET THE GOOD POINTS WHEN SHE SEES THE GARDEN 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE TWO HUNDRED TEN FOOT GARDEN KRISTIAN IT'S A FAMILY PARADISE 
MAYBE IF HER COMPASS IS BROKEN OR YOU TURN IT AROUND TO FACE SOUTH 
MICHELLE AND NIGEL AFTER ALL YOUR MOANING AND GROANING AT THE LAST PROPERTY 
I'M GONNA BAN MOANING ABOUT CERTAIN ITEMS HERE 
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO MENTION SIZE I WAS GONNA SAY IT LOOKS TINY DON'T SHOOT ME DOWN IN FLAMES YET 
SIZE BANNED WARDROBES BANNED 
GLOBAL POSITIONING OF THE GARDEN BANNED 
I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK NIGEL 
IT'S GOT CHARACTER I'LL STICK WITH THAT BECAUSE THAT'S ON THE UP 
THIS PROPERTY HAS LOADS OF CHARM IN THE VILLAGE OF BLAKEDOWN TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO BIRMINGHAM 
TELL US WHAT YOU THINK CHEERIO 
THE FIRST THING SHE SAID WAS A WHINGE IT DOES LOOK SMALL IT'LL BE A DAY OF WHINGING 
DOM IF THE SUN IS OVER THERE AND THIS IS THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
HOW CAN IT ALSO BE AT THE BACK GARDEN IF THAT'S THE SOUTH 
SHUT UP DIGBY SHE'S PROBABLY GOT A COMPASS IN HER POCKET I HOPE NOT 
NICE BIG LIGHT ROOM SHAME THE DOOR COMES IN ON TO THE LOUNGE 
WE COULD PORCH IT BUT NOT INSIDE COS IT'LL TAKE SPACE AWAY 
YOU'VE FAILED AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN IN THE LOUNGE THAT'S NOT FAILURE 
IT'S NOT VERY BIG THE REST OF IT IS BIG PROMISE 
THE FIREPLACE LETS IT DOWN COS IT DOESN'T QUITE GO WITH THE SURROUND 
IT DOESN'T QUITE GO WITH THE CHARACTER OF THE HOUSE NO 
YOUR PERIOD FEATURES ARE JUXTAPOSED WITH THE ORIGINAL DETAILING OF THE HOUSE 
HE WANTS A PERIOD PROPERTY NOT HER 
THAT'S NICE AN INNER HALLWAY SEE SHE LIKES THAT 
THIS IS LOVELY YEAH IT'S GOT A NICE BIG FAMILY FEEL TO IT I REALLY LIKE THIS 
EXCELLENT LOOK THAT IS SO CUTE 
EXCELLENT WHAT A GREAT ADJECTIVE 
THIS IS LOVELY I REALLY LIKE THIS YOU'VE WON HER HEART IN THE KITCHEN 
NICE LONG GARDEN SLIGHTLY NARROW IT'S A BIT SHADY 
I'VE GOT A BONE TO PICK WITH YOU THAT GARDEN IS NOT SOUTH FACING 
IT'S NORTH FACING YOU CAN TELL BY THE SATELLITE DISH 
YOU ARE LYING TO THEM I DID NOT SAY IT'S SOUTH FACING 
IT'S LONG BUT NARROW WHICH IS A SHAME I LIKE A BIT OF WIDTH 
THEY'RE ALL VERY NARROW THEY'RE ONLY NARROW HOUSES 
THEY SAID THEY WANTED A VERY WIDE BIG GARDEN 
IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON IT GOES BEHIND THE SHED 
JUST LIKE YOU IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON 
I LIKE THE WAY THE STAIRS BEND BACK YEAH OH LOOK IT OPENS UP STRAIGHT INTO THE LOFT LOVELY 
I THINK IN THE BIG SCHEME OF THINGS THAT THIS HOUSE GETS BETTER AS YOU GO UPSTAIRS 
I FIND THAT STRANGE YOU THINKING 
NICE HIGH CEILING STILL AN UNUSUAL USE OF SPACE FOR THE BED 
THINK WE'D GET TWO BEDS IN HERE THAT MIGHT BE TRICKY 
SMALLEST ROOM IN THE HOUSE YOU COULD GET TWO BUNK BEDS IN 
BATHROOM NEXT DOOR IT'S NICE AND LIGHT IN HERE 
BUT WE'D NEED I'D HAVE TO CHANGE THE BATH 
CHANGING THE BATH IT'S DOVE GREY 
THAT CAN BE VERY SOPHISTICATED NO WAY I WON'T HEAR A WORD SAID AGAINST DOVE GREY BATHS 
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT ONE NO WITH THE RIGHT TILES AND DECOR IT CAN LOOK VERY SOPHISTICATED 
THIS IS A NICE BRIGHT ROOM 
OBVIOUSLY GETS ALL THE SUN IN HERE 
ORIGINAL WINDOWS AGAIN THE CAT WOULD HAVE TO GO WE DON'T DO PETS IN OUR HOUSE ONLY KIDS 
SHE'S NOT AN ANIMAL LOVER SHE'S GOT FOUR KIDS THE LAST THING SHE NEEDS IS MORE ANIMALS 
OH IT'S AN OFFICE 
YEAH BUT IT COULD BE QUITE EASILY MADE INTO A BEDROOM 
I CAN'T SEE WHERE YOU'D GET TWO BEDS 
WE COULD COME UP HERE 
THIS IS NOT A SPACE FOR KIDS THIS IS A LUXURIOUS ROMANTIC SPACE FOR ADULTS IT'S FOR THE KIDS NO 
GOT A LOVELY FEEL TO THE HOUSE 
DOM I THINK THEY LIKE YOUR HOUSE THEY LIKE THE FEELING I GIVE EVERYBODY A GOOD FEELING 
MICHELLE WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE 
LET'S RECAP YOU SAID IF YOU BOUGHT ANY PROPERTY NO MATTER WHAT YOU WOULD REFIT THE KITCHEN 
YOU WALK INTO THIS HOUSE I LOVE THE KITCHEN IT'S QUITE UNUSUAL 
THERE AREN'T MANY UNITS THERE AND THEY SEEM OLD 
BUT THEY HAVE A LOVELY FEEL 
ORIGINAL TILED FLOOR ORIGINAL AGA 
I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU LOVE IT 
NOW THE PROBLEM THE CONTINUAL PROBLEM OF SPACE 
WHAT DO WE NEED TO ENHANCE IT TO MAKE IT PERFECT FOR YOU 
I WOULD REALLY LIKE ANOTHER RECEPTION ROOM RIGHT PREFERABLY AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE NOT THE FRONT 
I THINK THIS CAN BE DONE LOOK TO THIS PROPERTY NEXT DOOR 
THEY'VE GOT A BIG ROW OF OUTBUILDINGS THEY'VE CONVERTED 
YOU PROBABLY HAD THAT ONCE I THINK YOUR OUTBUILDINGS WOULD HAVE COME ALONG HERE 
HOWEVER THROUGH TIME THEY'VE GONE PUT THEM BACK 
BUILD YOURSELF A LOVELY HUGE EXTENSION NEXT DOOR HAVE BROUGHT IT RIGHT DOWN TO HERE 
WHAT A HUGE SPACE DEFINITELY WOULD YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS 
ONLY THE FACT THAT IT MIGHT BE DARK AND MAY MAKE THE KITCHEN TOO DARK 
I'D WANT TO BRICK THE WINDOW UP I WOULD MAKE IT OPEN PLAN 
AND IF THAT IS TOO MUCH THEN DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR TWO HUNDRED TEN FOOT GARDEN PUT A SUMMER HOUSE 
NIGEL YOU SAID YOU HAD A VERY POSITIVE FEELING ABOUT IT 
YEAH YEP IF YOU HAD TO FIND A MOAN WHAT WOULD IT BE 
THE HOUSE HAS GOT A LOVELY FEEL IT WAS A POSITIVE FEELING TO IT 
I FEEL IT'S JUST A BIT TOO SMALL 
WE SAID DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER NOW YOU DIDN'T LOOK BEHIND THAT CUPBOARD DOOR DID YOU 
NO WHY NOT THERE'S NO EXCUSES IS THERE NO COME ON 
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING 
YOU SEE NIGEL EVERY STORY HAS AN EPILOGUE 
THIS ONE HAS A VERY NICE EPILOGUE LOOK AT THIS 
OH THIS IS A BOYS' ROOM EXACTLY 
A POOL TABLE A BEER FRIDGE A LITTLE BAR TABLE 
PLENTY OF HEADROOM YOU'D HAVE TO GET RID OF THE DRINKS IF THE KIDS CAME DOWN HERE 
BUT THIS IS AN EXCELLENT ROOM TURN IT INTO THE KIDS' LITTLE SNUG 
THIS HAS A LOVELY FEEL TO IT MAKES THE HOUSE BIGGER IT DOES 
YOU'VE GOT AN EXTRA FLOOR YEAH IT'S THE THIRD ROOM I TALKED ABOUT LET'S GO GUESS THE PRICE 
LOVELY FLOWERS EVERYWHERE AND THESE ARE COMMON WEEDS O. I. 
WATCH IT NO NEGATIVITY IN THERE AT ALL THIS GIRL'S BEEN AMAZING SHE'S BEEN VERY GOOD 
RIGHT GUESS THE PRICE TIME HOW MUCH IS THIS HOUSE 
I WOULD SAY TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY O. K. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY 
TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
BECAUSE 
THE PRICE IS EVEN CHEAPER THAN YOU BOTH THINK IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR FIFTY SHORT OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
YOU HAVE LOADS OF MONEY LEFT OVER FIFTEEN GRAND TO DO THINGS TO THE BASEMENT THE EXTENSION 
WHAT A SUPERB HOUSE DOMINIC HAS FOUND YOU THAT HURT 
IT DOES HURT YOU IT DOES IF YOU WANT MORE PAIN WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE KRISTIAN'S CHOICE 
THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE IT THIS WAY 
INDEED PROPERTY THREE IS OUR WILD CARD AND IT'S MY CHOICE IT'S IN SUTTON COLDFIELD 
A FANTASTIC THREE BED SEMI THAT WILL KNOCK THEIR SOCKS OFF 
KRIS THE BATHROOM IS COMMENDABLE THE GARDEN SENSATIONAL BUT THEY WANTED TO LIVE IN HAGLEY 
IT'S THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CITY ARE YOU BARKING 
AS I SAID BEFORE THEY ORIGINALLY WANTED TO LIVE IN SUTTON 
IT'S NEAR THE SCHOOL THEY LOVE THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING BUT I HAVE 
SO STICK THAT UP YOUR CUL DE S. A. C. HOW RUDE I'LL TELL YOUR MOTHER 
RIGHT NIGEL AND MICHELLE HERE WE ARE AT THE WILD CARD 
WHY IS IT THE WILD CARD WELL BECAUSE I CAME TO SUTTON COLDFIELD WHICH WAS YOUR ORIGINAL CHOICE 
YEAH YOU NEVER LOOKED IN HAGLEY I DID BUT I USED MY COMMON SENSE DOM YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND 
AND THEN I FOUND THIS THIS PROPERTY HERE IS HIDING A HOME OF CONTEMPORARY CLASSIC CHARM 
IT'S SPACIOUS WITH A SOUTH FACING GARDEN SURELY THIS HAS TO BE IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I LIKE IT IT'S ON A VERY BUSY ROAD 
BUSY ROAD BUT CLOSE THAT DOOR AND THIS WORLD DISAPPEARS 
IN YOU GO AND HAVE A LOOK THANK YOU I'VE DONE VERY WELL OH BEHAVE 
RIGHT DOM HEADPHONES ON AGAIN I'VE GOT VERY GOOD VIBRATIONS 
NO THAT'S THE TRAFFIC GOING PAST BIG HEAVY LORRIES 
JUST PUT YOUR HEADPHONES ON I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU PLEASE 
THIS IS NICE LIKE THE FLOORS 
OH THAT'S LOVELY YEAH 
YOU'D LIKE THAT I'D ADORE IT GET RID OF THAT LINO I HAVEN'T GOT LINO 
OH THAT'S LOVELY 
YEAH I THINK KRISTIAN'S DONE A CRACKING JOB 
OH I SO WISH SHE HADN'T SAID THAT POLISHING MY SATIN RIBBONS HERE 
FEELS NICE AND SPACIOUS WE WOULDN'T BE CRAMPED WITH THE CHILDREN I LIKE THIS A LOT 
THE NOISE OF THE ROAD IS STILL A SLIGHT ISSUE 
SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE NOISE WHAT NOISY ROAD 
THE THING IS WITH DOUBLE GLAZING IT WOULD DAMPEN THE SOUND QUITE A LOT 
DOUBLE GLAZING CAN'T HEAR YOU 
OH THIS IS LOVELY 
YEAH THAT'S NICE NICE AND LIGHT OH THAT'S FANTASTIC LOOK AT THE FLOOR 
THOSE GROTTY OLD TILES IN THE KITCHEN ARE NOT SO GREAT 
I DON'T CARE IF YOU LIKE THE FLOORING IT'S IF THEY LIKE IT 
IT IS A SHAME THEY'VE PUT LAMINATE FLOOR AS OPPOSED TO ORIGINAL JUST TO GIVE IT THAT REAL FEEL 
THE GARDEN SEEMS QUITE SMALL 
BUT BECAUSE IT'S WIDER HERE IT DOESN'T SEEM CLAUSTROPHOBIC NO 
FLING THOSE FRENCH DOORS OPEN TO EXPLORE THAT SOUTH FACING GARDEN 
SOUTH FACING THAT'S LOVELY 
YEAH IT IS WE COULD PUT A NEW SHED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN TO STORE 
IT HASN'T GOT A GARAGE HAS IT 
THEY'VE STARTED PUTTING SHEDS UP 
QUITE LIKE THE STAIRS THEY COME STRAIGHT UP FROM THE DOOR WHICH WE DIDN'T LIKE 
BUT IT'S GOT CHARACTER YEAH 
THEY'RE JUST BEING POLITE OH THAT'S A DECENT SIZE 
IF IT'S THE SMALLEST 
THEY'RE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THE SMALLEST BEDROOM A DECENT SIZE 
I LIKE THE SKYLIGHT IN THE BATHROOM THAT'S A NICE TOUCH 
NOT OVER KEEN ON THE SHOWER BUT IT'S DONE WELL 
NO ROOM TO DO IT ANY OTHER WAY DOESN'T BOTHER ME YOU DON'T SHOWER 
WELL THIS IS AN EXCELLENT SIZE YEAH IF THIS IS THE MIDDLE BEDROOM 
THE BOYS COMFORTABLY FIT IN HERE 
I THINK THEY'RE WON OVER I THINK THEY'LL CHOOSE IT 
NOW THAT'S A GOOD SIZE OH FANTASTIC YEAH 
AGAIN IF WE PUT THE DOUBLE GLAZING IN IT WOULD DAMPEN THAT SOUND IT IS A DOWNSIDE THAT MAIN ROAD 
YOU CAN GO FOR TRIPLE GLAZING YEAH 
IT'S A HOUSE YOU WANT TO PICK UP AND PUT IN A CLOSE YEAH 
OH HE DOESN'T LIKE THE LOCATION IT'S ONLY THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
THE BACK OF THE HOUSE IT'S SUPERB HE SAID HE'D LIKE IT ELSEWHERE 
NO VERY NICE I THINK IT'S GOT A LOVELY FEEL TO IT I CAN SEE THINGS WORKING 
I'VE GOT TO GET IN THERE QUICKLY WHY THE SMELL OF DIESEL GIVES ME A HEADACHE BUT WE LOVE IT INSIDE 
MICHELLE I'VE GOT A VERY BIG BONE TO PICK WITH YOU I WORK WITH THE MOST EGOTISTICAL MAN 
AND ALL YOU SAID WAS HOW MUCH YOU LIKED THIS HOUSE SORRY APART FROM THE ROAD NOISE YEAH 
IT IS A REAL BONE OF CONTENTION FOR US THE CHILDREN ARE YOUNG 
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT BUT I THINK THE HOUSE IS PERFECT YES 
AND IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO PICK IT UP AND MOVE IT YEAH 
BUT LET'S LOOK AT REALITY 
I'LL STATE THE OBVIOUS REPLACE THOSE WINDOWS LOOK OVER HERE 
THERE'S HUGE GAPS THERE YEAH THAT'S WHY THE NOISE IS COMING IN 
YOU CAN GET REALLY MODERN SASH WINDOWS DOUBLE OR TRIPLE GLAZED 
I'D GET ALUMINIUM ONES THAT CAN HAVE A WOOD EFFECT SO THEY LOOK REALLY NICE 
YOU'D LOSE MOST OF THAT NOISE 
EVEN IF THAT DIDN'T WORK COS OF THE WIDTH OF THESE SILLS YOU COULD HAVE SECONDARY DOUBLE GLAZING 
IT WOULD KNOCK OUT NINETY PER CENT OF THE NOISE 
AND PUT A GATE UP AT THIS END AND SOME NICE FERNS TO KEEP OUT THE VIEW OF THE CARS GOING PAST 
AND HELP KEEP THE KIDS IN NOT IDEAL BUT IT WOULD MAKE IT ALMOST PERFECT FOR YOU IT WOULD 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IF WE COULD ELIMINATE THE NOISE 
IT WOULD BE ALMOST PERFECT NOT TOO LOUD OLD BIG HEAD MIGHT HEAR YOU 
BIG HEAD DID HEAR MEANWHILE WE'RE IN THE HALLWAY 
WE LOVE THE HOUSE DO WE NOT YEAH ONE THING I REALLY LIKE IS THIS LOVELY SPACE BY THE STAIRCASE 
IT'S LOVELY STRIPPED PINE AND THIS CUPBOARD IS HUGE 
TAKE A PEEK I KNOW YOU CAN'T SEE MUCH YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT 
LOTS OF SPACE STORAGE GOOD STORAGE WHAT ELSE 
THE KITCHEN FLOOR HOLD IT IS THAT ALL YOU'RE GONNA SAY 
NO COME HERE IS THAT ALL YOU'RE GOING TO SAY 
WHAT ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF A DOWNSTAIRS LOO 
ER HAS IT GOT THAT POTENTIAL WE'LL HAVE TO DO THIS AGAIN LOOK IN THERE 
SORRY ABOUT THIS O. K. FINISHED HERE HE COMES AGAIN 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT SPACE WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO PUT A DOWNSTAIRS LOO IN GENIUS 
OF COURSE YOU COULD YOU COULD HAVE A LOO DOWN THERE AND HAVE ROOM FOR YOUR CLOAKS

NORTH FACING GARDEN YES YES BUT IT'S ALL THEIRS FOR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
OH PLEASE 
THEN THERE'S THE WILD CARD MY CHOICE IN SUTTON COLDFIELD 
THANK YOU THREE LARGE BEDROOMS AND PRICED AT TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
SUTTON COLDFIELD I HEARD YOU LOOK AT IT IN SUTTON COLDFIELD 
O. K. PROPERTY NUMBER ONE THAT WAS THE SEMI 
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT DIDN'T LIKE THE ROOM AT THE BACK 
IT STOPPED LIGHT TO THE LOUNGE 
THE GARDEN WAS NICELY LANDSCAPED BUT I THINK TOO OVER LANDSCAPED FOR US WASN'T IT YEAH 
PROPERTY NUMBER TWO THAT WAS THIS HOUSE COULD BE A BIT OF A SQUASH 
BUT IT HAD A VERY NICE FEEL TO IT 
I QUITE LIKED THAT ONE YEAH IT WAS EVER SO LIGHT WASN'T IT A NICE LIGHT FEEL 
AND THE WILD CARD PROPERTY 
FANTASTIC SIZE YEAH JUST A BIT TOO CLOSE TO THE MAIN ROAD FOR ME 
YEAH LOTS OF REALLY LOVELY ORIGINAL FEATURES THOUGH 
SO OVERALL ALL THINGS CONSIDERED IT HAS TO BE PROPERTY NUMBER 
THERE'S TWO REASONS WHY I'M REALLY PLEASED YOU CHOSE NUMBER TWO 
FIRST I GENUINELY DO THINK IT'S THE RIGHT HOUSE FOR YOU 
IT WOULD SUIT YOU DOWN TO THE GROUND SECOND I SEE KRISTIAN'S BOTTOM LIP START TO DROOP 
AS HE WHINGES THAT YOU CHOSE MINE 
I KNOW KRISTIAN'S HOUSE WAS THE LARGER MORE CHARACTER HOUSE BUT IT WAS SLIGHTLY COLDER 
HANG ON I THOUGHT THE BIG NUMBER ONE THING WAS A SOUTH FACING GARDEN 
THE SUN IS OVER THERE SO THAT'S A NORTH FACING GARDEN 
YEAH IT'S RIGHT BUT THE LOUNGE IS ON THE FRONT 
UNLIKE OUR PREVIOUS HOMES 
SO YOU DON'T WANT A SOUTH FACING GARDEN I WANT THE SUN COMING INTO THE LOUNGE 
OUR VERY OWN SURVEYOR GAVE THE HOUSE THE ONCE OVER 
IT'S NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY AND WE'D IMPLORE YOU TO GET A FULL STRUCTURAL SURVEY 
HOWEVER A GOOD BILL OF HEALTH BUT THE ATTIC CONVERSION 
WHEN IT WAS BUILT IT WAS PERFECT 
BUT REGULATIONS MOVE ON YOU MIGHT WANT A FIRE ESCAPE AND SMOKE ALARM 
NOW THE NEXT POINT QUITE SERIOUS IS THE BOILER IS POSITIONED IN ONE OF THE BEDROOMS 
THE FLUE IS QUITE CLOSE TO THE WINDOW NOT A MAJOR JOB BUT YOU NEED TO EXTEND THAT FLUE 
GET PROFESSIONAL ADVICE A CORGI REGISTERED ENGINEER 
DO THAT AND BE SAFE AS HOUSES 
THAT'S IT TEST DRIVE TIME GO AND ENJOY IT HAVE FUN 
YOU'RE ALMOST GIVING A LECTURE NUMBER TWO WAS THE WINNER ALWAYS WAS 
AND HERE THEY COME LOVELY PARKING NIGEL I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM ALL FIT IN THERE 
IT'S GOING TO BE NICE AND SNUG LOOK STRAIGHT INTO THE GARDEN 
THEY COULD PROBABLY GET LOST DOWN THERE 
DID I FORGET TO MENTION THEY GET TWO HUNDRED TEN FEET OF GARDEN 
OH YES TWO HUNDRED TEN FEET OF NORTH FACING GARDEN DOM 
DIDN'T PUT THEM OFF THOUGH THEY REJECTED YOURS LOOK AT THE KIDS 
EVEN MICHELLE'S GONE ALL ROMANTIC 
JUST PLEDGE YOUR UNDYING LOVE TO ME 
THIS BETTER BE GOOD SHALL I SING TO HIM SHALL I 
SAVE YOUR LOVE MY DARLING SAVE YOUR LOVE 
IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN A NORTH FACING GARDEN I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT 
I'M GLAD THAT'S OVER THE AGA'S DIVERTED HER ATTENTION 
AND AS PREDICTED NIGEL'S MADE A RUN FOR IT INTO THE CELLAR WITH THE BOYS 
WHILE THE GIRLS INVESTIGATE THE BEDROOMS AND THE BATHROOM 
NIGEL'S BRUSHING UP ON HIS DIY 
HAPPY FAMILIES ISN'T HOUSE BUYING GRAND 
WELL GUYS O. K. YOU DECIDED TO TEST DRIVE DOMINIC'S CHOICE 
DOES IT STILL HAVE THAT LOVELY HOMELY FEELING 
IT DOES HAVE A LOVELY HOMELY FEEL TO IT YEAH IT IS A LOVELY HOUSE 
I WOULDN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY THAT WE CHOSE DOM'S CHOICE 
TAKE IT PERSONALLY I WOULD WE'LL HAVE WORDS LATER 
SO THE POTENTIAL IS VERY EXCITING TO EXTEND DO THINGS TO IT 
ARE YOU NOT CHOMPING AT THE BIT 
YEAH LIKE I WANNA DIG I WANNA MAKE HOLES YEAH 
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER AT THE END OF THE WEEK YOU'LL BE HOMELESS 
YEAH YOU WANTED TO DOWNSIZE I GOT YOU A SMALLER HOUSE 
ARE YOU GOING TO BARTER OR SCARPER I THINK WE'RE GONNA SCARPER 
OUCH OUCH I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN YOUR SHOES WHY WHY WHY 
WELL IT REALLY IS JUST DOWN TO SIZE 
WE DON'T THINK WE CAN ALL FIT IN 
WELL THAT'S SAD THAT'S LIFE CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL GOOD LUCK LET US KNOW HOW YOU GET ON BYE 
OH DOM THAT IS SO SO SAD I THINK THEY MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE 
VERY NOBLE OF YOU TO ADMIT IT THAT HOUSE WAS PERFECT FOR THEM 
NO THE MISTAKE WAS TEST DRIVING YOUR CHOICE AND NOT MINE 
YOU'RE LIKE AN OLD RECORD YOU GO ON AND ON 
YOU'RE LIKE AN OLD SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY WHAT BEFORE YOUR TIME SHOWING YOUR AGE 
IF YOU'RE HAVING PROBLEMS FINDING A DREAM PROPERTY GIVE US A SHOUT 
ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T BUY MY HOUSE IN SUTTON COLDFIELD 
THEY'VE HAD AN OFFER ACCEPTED FOR ONE TWO MINUTES' FROM IT 
SO MY EXPERTISE WINS THE DAY I'VE HAD ENOUGH I'M OFF 
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT FOLLOWING ME TRUST ME I WON'T 
COMING UP ON TODAY'S CASH IN THE ATTIC SOMETHING THAT I TAKE A FANCY TO 
WELCOME TO CASH IN THE ATTIC
