HELLO AND WELCOME TO POINTS OF VIEW 
PEOPLE SAY HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT TO COVER 
THE ANSWER IS SOMETIMES ONE VIEWER CAN GIVE US SUCH A STONKING OBSERVATION ABOUT A B. B. C. SHOW 
THAT'S ENOUGH 
MOST OF THE TIME IT'S THE SHEER WEIGHT OF MAIL ON ANY ISSUE 
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS INDUCING 
THAT DISTINCTIVE COLLECTIVE VIEWER YOWL 
THE BIG ONE IS THE SQUEEZING OF END CREDITS 
WITH LOTS OF YOU POSING THE QUESTION IF SOMETHING IS SO SMALL YOU CAN'T SEE IT 
WHAT IS THE POINT OF SHOWING IT 
WE'RE STILL CHASING THE OFFICIAL ANSWER SECOND IS INTRUSIVE BACKGROUND MUSIC 
REMEMBER LAST YEAR WHEN THEY SWITCHED OFF ALL OF IT FOR ALAN TITCHMARSH'S NATURE OF BRITAIN 
IF YOU SEE A SHOT OF A BIRD FLYING THERE'S NOTHING TO HEAR EXCEPT THE DISTANT BEAT OF WINGS 
IT DOESN'T CAUSE NATIONAL PANIC 
OR RIOTING IN PUBLIC PLACES IT'S ACTUALLY WHISPER IT BETTER 
JOY 
BUT ISN'T IT STRANGE THIS IMPROVEMENT IS LESS WORK FOR THE PROGRAMME MAKERS YET THEY RESIST IT 
ANSWERS COMING ON THIS TOO I PROMISE HOPEFULLY BEFORE OUR SCALES BREAK OR THE POSTBAG BURSTS 
ALSO PILING UP LETTERS E. MAILS TEXTS CALLS MESSAGES 
SAYING YOU ARE SICK OF REPEATS 
YOU ARE SICK OF REPEATS 
MAYBE WE'RE IN A KIND OF LIMBO HERE 
WE'RE BETWEEN THE ANALOGUE WORLD WHERE YOU ONLY GOT A SECOND CHANCE TO SEE A SHOW IF IT WAS SHOWN AGAIN 
AND THE DIGITAL WORLD CHARACTERISED BY THE RATHER NIFTY IPLAYER 
WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT THAT 
MAKING THE UNMISSABLE UNMISSABLE 
WE USED TO ONLY GET A SECOND CHANCE IF A PROGRAMME WAS REPEATED 
NOW WITH IPLAYER YOUTUBE SKY ETC 
THERE'S ALWAYS A SECOND CHANCE AND WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE RUNNING THIS PLACE HAVEN'T NOTICED 
AND SO THEY STILL SHOW REPEATS AND THEY WILL STOP 
WHAT'S ON THE CHANNEL FOR THE NEXT GENERATION BUT ONE 
THE GROWN UPS WHO RUN THE BEDTIME HOUR ON CBEEBIES FROM SIX P. M. SEVEN P. M. 
HAVE CHANGED THE LINE UP OF PROGRAMMES TANTRUMS EVERYWHERE 
POPULAR SHOWS SUCH AS IN THE NIGHT GARDEN AND STORY MAKERS 
WERE SUDDENLY REPLACED WITHOUT WARNING 
AS EVERY PARENT KNOWS REPEATS ARE EXACTLY WHAT TODDLERS WANT 
SUSAN BRIGGS WROTE TO US IN DESPAIR 
STORY MAKERS HAD HELPED HER SON WIND DOWN AFTER A HARD DAY'S PLAY 
HIS REACTION WAS TO BURST INTO TEARS 
WHY IS IT NOT ON IT'S ALWAYS ON 
HE WON'T WATCH CBEEBIES AT NIGHT NOW BECAUSE STORY MAKERS IS NOT ON 
DO YOU WANT TO WATCH MAMMA MIRABELLE THE THING THEY REPLACED IT WITH NO I DON'T LIKE IT 
NURSERIES HAVE LONG RECOGNISED THAT ROUTINES ARE IMPORTANT 
REPETITION IS SOMETHING WE DO A LOT IN THE NURSERIES 
WE REPEAT ACTIVITY SO CHILDREN BECOME CONFIDENT BY WHAT THEY LEARN 
THEY TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE THEY BECOME CONFIDENT LEARNERS 
WE LOOK AT REPEATING AND EXTENDING ACTIVITIES 
AND IF PARENTS NEED TO USE BEDTIME HOUR TO INTRODUCE ROUTINES AT HOME 
THAT'S THEIR CHOICE TO DO THAT 
THE GROWN UPS AT CBEEBIES DECLINED TO SPEAK ON CAMERA FRIGHTENED OF BEING HIT BY A HAIL OF DUMMIES 
BUT THE CONTROLLER OF CBEEBIES ISSUED A STATEMENT 
WHAT A CLASSIC 
ON THE ONE CHANNEL WHERE REPEATS ARE MET WITH GURGLES OF JOY WHAT DO THEY DO 
THEY SET A LIMIT ON THEM YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE MAD TO WORK HERE 
NOW ONTO WHAT MUST BE A SURE FIRE WINNER 
NOTHING GOES DOWN LIKE A COSTUME DRAMA ON A SUNDAY EVENING CRANFORD WAS A RIP ROARING SUCCESS 
THE B. B. C.'S ADAPTATIONS OF CLASSIC NOVELS ARE SHOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD 
A DRAMA BASED ON THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JANE AUSTEN IS A PRETTY SAFE BET 
THEN WE WALKED INTO THE COTTAGE 
AND I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE 
I KNEW MY MOTHER WOULD BE HAPPY AND MY SISTER WOULD BE COMFORTABLE 
YOU'VE LEFT SOMEONE OUT 
AND I WOULD BE FREE TO WRITE 
MISS AUSTEN NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH REGRETS THEN 
ANOTHER DRAMA WITH ITS FAIR SHARE OF TRAILS IS THE INVISIBLES WITH WARREN CLARKE AND ANTHONY HEAD 
THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS ARE OUT OF RETIREMENT 
THAT'S WHAT HIS TROUBLE WAS THAT'S MORE LIKE IT 
CATCH IT IF YOU CAN NEW DRAMA THE INVISIBLES THURSDAY ON B. B. C. ONE 
IT'S BEEN TRAILED FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS BUT HAD ITS FIRST AIRING 
ON THURSDAY EVENING 
THE SAFE'S ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHAT LOCKS ON THE UPPER WINDOWS 
TWO FOR SEVEN QUID AT DO IT ALL NOTHING WORTH NICKING UP THERE 
WHAT 
THE INVISIBLES 
WE'RE BACK 
WITH ANTHONY HEAD AND WARREN CLARKE IN LEAD ROLES THERE WAS AN AIR OF ANTICIPATION ON OUR MESSAGE BOARD 
AND AFTER TRANSMISSION 
THE OVERWHELMING REACTION WAS THAT IT HAD SOMETHING 
BUT WAS NOT THE RIP ROARING SUCCESS EXPECTED 
BUT THE GERIATRIC CRIMINALS DID PULL OFF THE BIGGEST FRAUD SET IN DEVON IT WAS SHOT IN IRELAND 
WE WANTED TO FILM OVER HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE VARIOUS CASH BENEFITS 
TRUTHFULLY 
IT'S EXPENSIVE TO FILM IN ENGLAND IT'S QUITE A WARM SHOW 
WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT HUMAN FRAILTY AND KIND OF HUMAN SORT OF FOIBLES 
AND ER FOOLISHNESS WHICH WE KIND OF ALL EXHIBIT 
WHAT I THINK YOU'VE PUT A BIT OF WEIGHT ON IN THE INTERVENING YEARS 
THE CAST INVESTED A GREAT DEAL IN THEIR CHARACTERISATION SO HOPE IT WILL GROW ON PEOPLE 
I USED TO SLEEP WITH THE LOCKS TO TRY AND GET IN TUNE WITH THEM 
UM SO THEY'RE THEY'RE A PART OF ME 
BUT ALSO SID IS A PART OF ME 
WE'RE ATTACHED AT THE HIP 
HE'S A GENTLE SOUL AND MOST OF HIS ENTHUSIASM 
ENDS UP BEING MISPLACED OR IT GOES THE WRONG WAY 
AND IT IRKS MAURICE QUITE A LOT 
AND SID ALWAYS SORT OF CRUMBLES AND THINKS 
OH WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG NOW 
AND FROM THE OLDER GENERATION TRYING TO CAPTURE ITS LOST YOUTH TO BRITAIN'S YOUNGEST GRANNIES 
BET YOU CAN'T GUESS WHICH CHANNEL IS SHOWING THAT 
TONIGHT CASEY'S WITH THE BABYSITTER 
SO HER MUM GRANDMOTHER PAULINE AND A FRIEND CAN PAINT THE TOWN RED 
WHEN I GO OUT TONIGHT I'M NO ONE'S MAM 
AND I'M CERTAINLY NO ONE'S NANA 
NOT HARD TO WORK OUT THAT OFFERING FROM B. B. C. THREE 
THEIR INVESTIGATION INTO THE WORLD OF SWEATSHOP CLOTHING MANUFACTURE HAS GOT YOU TALKING TOO 
DIRTY SMELLY DISGUSTING 
IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE 
WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY TOILETS NOT EVEN GOT A SHOWER 
IT'S DIRTY AND IT SMELLS REALLY BAD THIS PLACE IS MY IDEA OF HELL 
B. B. C. FOUR HAS ALSO TRAVELLED TO SOUTH EAST ASIA FOR A LOOK AT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CHINA 
CHINESE SCHOOL LOOKS AT THE LONG HOURS AND TOUGH CURRICULUM 
ENDURED BY STUDENTS PREPARING FOR THEIR FUTURE ROLE IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMY 
ALL THE STUDENTS LIVE AT THE SCHOOL FOR THIRTY NINE WEEKS OF THE YEAR 
TODAY IS SPECIAL 
THE ANNUAL AUTUMN OUTING 
SCHOOLS PROVISION IN CHINA UNDER THE MICROSCOPE THERE 
WHAT OF HOSPITAL PROVISION IN BRITAIN 
ON PANORAMA THE QUESTION WAS HOW SAFE IS YOUR HOSPITAL 
THESE VIEWERS WERE MORE CONCERNED WITH HOW USEFUL WAS PANORAMA 
THESE ARE MEMBERS OF THE NCHI CAMPAIGN FOR GREATER AWARENESS OF HOSPITAL INFECTIONS 
SO THEY WERE EAGER TO PUT PANORAMA UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 
ESPECIALLY THE OLDER WARDS 
THE PERSON OUT OF BED ONE IS SAT IN THE CHAIR 
AND THE PERSON IN BED TWO IS IN BED 
THEY MAY AS WELL BE IN BED TOGETHER AS FAR AS GERMS ARE CONCERNED 
IT BROUGHT OUT A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR THE NURSES THEY WERE DOING 
AN HORRENDOUS JOB UNDER HORRENDOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THEY HAD NO SUPPORT 
WHEN THE CONSULTANT CAME IN HELD THE DOOR OPEN 
WENT STRAIGHT TO A PATIENT NEVER WASHED HIS HANDS 
THE IMPORTANT PART WAS THAT THE PROGRAMME WAS ON AT THE WRONG TIME 
TEN TWENTY P. M. TO ELEVEN TWENTY P. M. SUNDAY NIGHT PEOPLE GETTING UP FOR WORK 
IT'S JUST AT THE WRONG TIME 
THEY WERE PLEASED AT THE WAY THE ISSUE WAS HIGHLIGHTED 
BUT PERHAPS MORE PEOPLE NEEDED TO SEE IT 
AND WE WRAP UP FOR THIS WEEK 
BUT IF YOU'RE PART OF A COMMUNITY GROUP AND WANT TO TELL US WHAT IMPACT A PROGRAMME MAKES ON YOU 
OR MAYBE YOU'RE JUST GETTING MORE AND MORE WOUND UP WRITE TO US AT 
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK 
PLAN'S GOOD 
MO I'M IN 
BOYS ARE BRIEFED 
AND HASN'T HE GOT A SAFE 
ABOUT AS SUBTLE AS A FLYING BRICK 
WAH AH AH 
WE'LL BE FINE YEAH I CAN DO THESE WITH ME EYES SHUT 
DO THE JOB WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A HITCH 
ARE YOU SURE 
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING 
IS IT ALWAYS WRONG TO LIE ABSOLUTELY
