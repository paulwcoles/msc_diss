AS A KID YOU WATCH THE F. A. CUP THE 
ONE GAME OF THE YEAR 
WHO WOULD 
HAVE THOUGHT A POMPEY CARDIFF 
FINAL CERTAINLY NOT THE BOOKIES 
IT DOESN'T ROLL OFF THE TONGE 
CARDIFF CITY IN AN F. A. CUP FINAL 
PEOPLE GET BLASE EVERY YEAR CHELSEA 
ARSENAL MAN UNITED BUT FOR PEOPLE 
FROM CARDIFF IT IS SPECIAL IN IN QUARTER FINALS NOBODY GAVE CARDIFF 
A CHANCE NOR US A CHANCE 
IT IS NOT THE NORM FOR US AND IT 
IS NOT THE NORM FOR HARRY'S TEAM 
IT IS CARDIFF AGAINST PORTSMOUTH 
IT IS TOUGH BEING THE FAVOURITE I I AM GOING TO DO BATTLE WITH HIM FOR 
NINETY MINUTES 
GOOD EVENING FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN FIFTEEN YEARS THE F. A. CUP 
WAS TO HAVE A WINNER FROM OUTSIDE 
THE BIG FOUR PORTSMOUTH FACE 
CARDIFF IN THE CUP FINAL WITH A 
DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE TELL ME WHERE YOU HAVE COME FROM 
SPAIN 
CAN YOU DO IT YES 
YOU HAVE SPAIN YES COME FROM 
ALL THE WAY FROM 
AUSTRALIA WOULD NOT MISS IT FOR 
THE WORLD 
WE CAN MAKE HISTORY TODAY IT HAS 
BEEN A LONG TIME FOR THIS CLUB IT 
IS AMAZING FOR THESE PEOPLE AND I 
AM SURE CARDIFF WILL FEEL THE SAME 
WE ARE NOT COMING HERE TO LIE DOWN 
WE WILL COME TO HAVE A GO NOTHING 
WILL GIVE ME GREATER PLEASURE THAN 
LEADING THE TEAM OUT 
THAT IS WHAT 
THEY ARE PLAYING FOR AS CATHERINE 
JENKINS SINGS LAND OF MY FATHERS 
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN WITH LESLEY 
GARRETT THE COMMENTATORS AT WEMBLEY WERE MARK LAWRENSON AND JOHN MOTSON HARRY REDKNAPP BROUGHT PEDRO MENDES 
BACK LAST WEEKEND HE KEEPS HIS 
SPACE JOHN UTAKA WHO MISSED THE 
SEMI FINAL WITH INJURY IS PART OF 
A FIVE MAN MID FIVE MAN MIDFIELD 
BEHIND KANU BUT YOU CAN EXPECT 
UTAKA AND KRANJCAR ON THE LEFT TO 
PUSH UP AND MAKE IT A FOUR THREE THREE SINCE 
THE SEMI FINAL PAUL PARRY HAS 
REGAINED FITNESS SO HE IS UP FRONT 
FOR CARDIFF WITH JIMMY FLOYD 
HASSELBAINK FOR THOSE OF YOU NOT 
FAMILIAR WITH THE TEAM PETER 
ENCKELMAN IN GOAL KEVIN MCNAUGHTON 
ROGER JOHNSON GLENN LOOVENS TONY 
CAPALDI HERE WE GO THE F. A. CUP FINAL OF 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NUMBER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN IN HISTORY OF 
THIS COMPETITION ONLY ONCE HAS THE 
F. A. CUP BEEN CARRIED OUT OF ENGLAND 
AND THAT WAS BY CARDIFF CITY IN 
NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN PORTSMOUTH ONE IT IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AND 
KEPT IT FOR SIX YEARS DURING THE 
WAR THEY WON IT AND NOW BOTH 
CLUBS ARE BACK HERE IMMEDIATELY 
DIARRA GETS FREE KICK FOR 
PORTSMOUTH I FANCY HE WILL PLAY 
FURTHER FORWARD THAN IN THE SEMI 
FINAL 
MOST DEFINITELY MENDES WILL FINAL PROTECT THE BACK FOUR HREIDARSSON HAS GONE UP FOR THIS 
FREE KICK KRANJCAR HAS PUT THE 
BALL DOWN HREIDARSSON HAS HIS ARM UP IN THE 
CENTRE IT WENT HIS WAY PETER 
ENCKELMAN INCIDENTALLY ON LOAN TO 
CARDIFF FROM BLACKBURN ROVERS 
MAKES THE FIRST SAVE 
I CAN'T 
BELIEVE HE SHOT FROM THERE PAUL PARRY CAME IN 
HE HAS THE PACE HE FORCED DAVID JAMES TO ADVANCE 
THE BALL WAS PLAYED OVER SOL 
CAMPBELL DAVID JAMES DID WELL 
BECAUSE HIS STARTING POSITION WAS 
SEVEN OR EIGHT YARDS OUT OF HIS 
GOAL AND THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE 
OTHERWISE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
TOUCH AND GO FOR A PENALTY AND ALL 
SORTS OF THINGS IT IS A PACY START A GOOD START EXACTLY WHAT THE GAME NEEDS PETER 
WHITTINGHAM MANOEUVRED THE BALL WELL NO FREE KICK IT WAS WORTH A TRY HREIDARSSON JUST MADE SURE THAT WHITTINGHAM WAS COVERED TONY ADAMS 
ALONGSIDE HARRY REDKNAPP WHO 
LIFTED THE CUP THREE TIMES AS AN 
ARSENAL CAPTAIN AGAIN PARIS MADE THE FORWARD AND PARIS WAS IN AGAIN FOR CARDIFF 
DAVID JAMES REQUIRED AGAIN TO AND 
SAVED PAUL PARRY 
IT WAS A GREAT 
BALL IT WAS A BIT FORTUITOUS 
GREAT TIMING OF THE RUN AND A GOOD 
SAVE BY JAMES IT WAS DEFLECTED IT CAME OFF HIS 
OWN MAN AS WELL DAVID JAMES WAS 
ROUTED 
THE REFEREE HAS GIVEN THE ROUTED GOAL KICK IT WAS A DECENT BALL 
WITH THE OUTSIDE OF THE FOOT NOT 
THE GREATEST CLEARANCE WITH WITH PORTSMOUTH IT IS LIKE THEY STARTED 
AGAINST WEST BROM DON'T YOU THINK 
WITH FOUR THREE THREE AS WELL YOU SAID 
KANU IS ISOLATED 
THEY HAVE NOT HIT 
THE BALL OVER THE TOP BECAUSE NO 
ONE IS RUNNING FOR THEM AT THE 
MOMENT CARDIFF LOOK THE BETTER 
TEAM 
THAT IS CERTAINLY HOW IT WAS TEAM WITH WEST BROM KEVIN PHILLIPS GAVE 
PORTSMOUTH ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE GLEN JOHNSON HAS PUT THE BALL DOWN 
WAITING FOR HREIDARSSON AND SOL 
CAMPBELL AND DISTIN THE GOALKEEPER FUMBLED NEARLY FOR KANU THAT WAS A WORRYING MOMENT FOR PETER ENCKELMAN THIS IS A BETTER SPELL FOR PORTSMOUTH THAT WAS DIARRA PETER ENCKELMAN 
WILL BE DELIGHTED BECAUSE HE HAS 
GOT AWAY WITH ONE NO DOUBT ABOUT 
IT THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO PRESSURE 
ON HIM AND HE JUST FUMBLED IT VERY 
STRANGE EVERYBODY HELPED HIM OUT 
IN THE END HE SHOULD HAVE JUST 
CAUGHT IT L. DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS 
TRYING TO DO 
KANU COULD NOT TURN 
IT IN 
HE WENT DOWN EARLY AS THOUGH 
HE HAD MADE HIS MIND UP WHAT HE WAS 
TRYING TO DO 
DAVID JONES' TEAM IF 
THEY WIN THE F. A. CUP WOULD GO INTO 
THE UEFA CUP THERE HAS BEEN 
CONFIRMED BY THE F. A. SO THERE IS A 
BIG INCENTIVE TODAY KANU BRILLIANT WELL HE DID 
BRILLIANTLY DIDN'T HE THAT WAS 
THE FIRST TIME SOMEBODY HAD RUN 
FROM MIDFIELD IT WAS UTAKA WASN'T 
IT IT WAS A GREAT BALL IN AS WELL 
HE ONCE SCORED A GOAL AT CHELSEA 
FOR ARSENAL FROM A NOT DISSIMILAR 
TIGHT ANGLE THIS TIME HE SLIPPED 
IT THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST 
BETTER FROM PORTSMOUTH CERTAINLY OH HARRY HOW CLOSE WAS THAT YOU CANNOT GET MUCH CLOSER IT IS A FREE KICK FOR JOE LEDLEY ON 
THE EDGE OF THE AREA AGAINST GLEN 
JOHNSON 
GLEN JOHNSON SHOWED HIM JOHNSON THAT WAY AND HE WENT AND THEN HE 
WON HIMSELF A FREE KICK HE CAUGHT 
HIM NO ARGUMENT IT WAS PAUL PARRY WHO DROPPED BACK 
AND GOT THE SHOT IN EVERYBODY ELSE 
WAS IN THE PENALTY AREA HE HAS LOST IT GOING BACK TO THE 
FREE KICK IT WAS A LOVELY CHANCE 
FOR PARIS ON HIS LEFT FOOT PAUL 
PARRY FREE KICK CARDIFF LEDLEY BROUGHT DOWN 
DAFT FOUL THAT IS DOWN CARDIFF DOWN CARDIFF HAVE HAD PLENTY OF FREE KICKS AND 
CORNERS AND THROW INS AND IT HAS 
BROUGHT THE PARTNERSHIP FROM THE 
BACK FORWARD EVERY TIME WE HAVE HAD A GOOD DELIVERY FROM 
THE CARDIFF FREE KICKS JUST COULD 
NOT QUITE DIRECT IT ON TARGET NOT A GREAT DEAL OF QUALITY FROM PORTSMOUTH SO FAR MENDEZ PLANE IT WIDE TO GLEN JOHNSON ENCKELMAN PUNCHING AWAY GLEN JOHNSON'S CROSS THE DECISION BEFORE BY ENCKELMAN TO 
PUNT FROM THE CROSS WAS A GOOD ONE 
IT WAS A GOOD SAVE LOTS OF HEIGHT 
AND DISTANCE ON IT 
KANU WAS THERE IT IS IT GIVEN KANU AND PORTSMOUTH AT THINK THEY 
HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD 
THEY HAVE IT 
WAS A BRILLIANTLY WORKED IN CROSS 
ENCKELMAN AGAIN PUNCHES AWAY BUT 
CONNOR WAS SO CLOSE FANTASTIC 
REACTION BY KANU 
WATCH THE 
ASSISTANT REFEREE WHEN THE BALL 
GOES IN HE STOPS FOR A MOMENT 
ANYWAY IT IS A GOAL 
NO ARGUMENT 
ABOUT THAT A LOVELY WHIPPED IN 
CROSS BY UTAKA HE IS VERY QUICK 
KANU OF 
HE SCORED THE WINNER HERE 
AGAINST WEST BROM IN THE SEMI FINAL 
AND OPENED THE SCORING IN THE FINAL 
KANU WAS SO QUICK TO GET HIS FOOT 
IN THERE AHEAD OF ROGER JOHNSON ONE HECK OF A TACKLE BY SOL CAMPBELL 
JIMMY FLOYD JUST OVERRAN CAMPBELL THE BALL 
PORTSMOUTH HAVE WON ALL 
TWENTY ONE GAMES THIS SEASON IN WHICH THEY 
HAVE SCORED FIRST IT DOES NOT BODE 
WELL FOR CARDIFF THERE IS NO FLAG PARRY FOR CARDIFF IN CAME MCNAUGHTON ALL THE WAY 
FROM RIGHT BACK 
BECAUSE OF THE WIT 
HERE HE DECIDED NOT TO SHOOT IT 
WAS A GOOD IDEA BUT THE PASS WAS A 
BIT TOO QUICK FOR MCNAUGHTON YOU 
CAN SEE WHY HE DID NOT SHOOT 
BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE GLEN JOHNSON A FIRST TOUCH LET HIM 
DOWN AND THEN HE COMMITTED FOUL 
THE BALL WAS PINCHED AWAY FROM HIM 
HE WAS CAUGHT LEDLEY 
ONE MINUTE 
WILL BE ADDED AT THE END OF THE FORTY FIVE 
HERE FOR STOPPAGES IF CARDIFF ARE 
TO HAVE ANYTHING TO SHOW FOR THIS 
THEY WILL HAVE TO SCORE PRETTY FAST SOL CAMPBELL NOT VERY HAPPY WITH 
THAT FREE KICK AWARDED AND HERE IS 
SOMEBODY ELSE WHO IS NOT HAPPY 
HREIDARSSON 
THERE 
IS NO DOUBT IT HREIDARSSON IS A FREE KICK 
THE YELLOW CARD FOR 
HERMANN HREIDARSSON FOR DISSENT IT IT WAS NOT SOL CAMPBELL GLEN JOHNSON SQUEEZED THE BALL OUT FOR POMPEY THIS IS SURELY THE LAST CHANCE OF THE HALF IT HAS BEEN HOOKED BACK IN NO 
GOAL THAT ONE WAS WIPED OUT NO 
DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
I THINK THE 
WHISTLE HAD ALREADY GONE DAVID DAVID JAMES HAS HAD WORRYING MOMENTS AT 
WEMBLEY WITH CUP FINAL CORNERS 
WHEN THAT WAS HOOKED BACK IN IS IT 
HANDS 
THE REFEREE GAVE THIS FOR HANDS HANDS IT WAS NOT FOR A FOUL HIS 
WHISTLE WENT TO HIS MOUTH STRAIGHT 
AWAY 
THE IT WAS LOOVENS IT WAS AWAY THE DUTCHMAN LOOVENS HAS NOT SCORED THIS SEASON 
PORTSMOUTH THE PREMIER LEAGUE SIDE 
UNDER HARRY REDKNAPP HAVE THE 
ADVANTAGE THE GOAL SCORER AT THIRTY SEVEN 
MINUTES WAS KANU CARDIFF CITY WHO 
STARTED WELL GO INTO THE DRESSING 
ROOM THE CHAMPIONSHIP SIDE A GOAL 
BEHIND PAUL PARRY THEIR MOST 
DANGEROUS ATTACKER EARLY ON BUT AT 
HALF TIME IN THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVENTH F. A. CUP FINAL 
IT IS ZERO TO ONE TO PORTSMOUTH CARDIFF CITY START THE SECOND HALF HERE PLAYING FROM THE RIGHT ROGER JOHNSON TO BE MARKED BY CAN'T 
BACK BY KANU TO IS GAVIN RAE IT IS A FREE KICK TO CARDIFF JOE LEDLEY SHOWING AGAIN WHAT A 
CLEVER PLAYER HE CAN BE 
HE HAS 
GIVEN JOHNSON SOME PROBLEMS TODAY 
THIS WILL GIVE THE OTHER JOHNSON 
ROGER THE CHANCE TO MOVE FORWARD 
AGAIN IN THE PORTSMOUTH PENALTY BOX WHITTINGHAM TO TAKE IT WELL THE ASSISTANT REFEREE SAYS GOAL KICK 
JOHNSON'S CLAIMED A GOAL KICK CORNER GREAT BALL IN AS WELL IT 
WAS A CORNER UNLUCKY NOW ROGER JOHNSON IS BACK 
IN DEFENCE HE GETS FREE KICK AND AN INJURY THAT DOES HURT DIARRA IS PLAYING AS WELL AS ANYBODY 
I CANNOT DISAGREE WITH ANYBODY THAT HE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD HE COMES HASSELBAINK HAVE NOT SEEN TOO MUCH OF HIM OH IT HAS GONE OUT FOR A CORNER 
THAT SPLIT SECOND AS IT LEFT KANU'S 
BOOT IT COULD HAVE GONE ANYWHERE 
FORTUNATELY FOR CARDIFF IT GOES 
WIDE GOOD PLAY BY PORTSMOUTH THEY THEY IT WAS LOOVENS IT IS A CORNER TO 
PORTSMOUTH SOL CAMPBELL IS FORWARD FOR THIS ONE SO IS DISTIN AND HREIDARSSON HE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO PLAY THE BALL AT ALL DIARRA HAD PLAYERS RIGHT AND LEFT 
THERE IT WAS A GOOD BREAK IF THEY 
HAD KEPT THE BALL LEDLEY NEEDED TO WAIT A BIT ODD A 
LITTLE BIT LONGER HE HAD LOADS OF 
TIME AND THERE WAS NO WAY THAT 
PERRIE COULD GET ROUND CAMPBELL IN 
SUCH SHORT SPACE OF TIME 
THAT IS 
A FREE KICK KRANJCAR HAS CERTAINLY 
COME INTO THE GAME HE SCORED FOR 
CROATIA AGAINST ENGLAND SOME OF US 
WILL NOT WANT TO BE REMINDED ABOUT 
THAT 
TOO LATE 
HE ALSO SCORED THAT AGAINST SCOTLAND FOR CROATIA FREE 
KICK TO PORTSMOUTH CORNER THE THREE HEAVIES FROM THE BACK 
WILL COME FORWARD AGAIN FOR THIS I I DO NOT THINK THAT WAS A CORNER 
ANYWAY FOR WOULD COME CAMPBELL AND 
HREIDARSSON FORWARD MUNTARI WITH THE SHOT PETER 
ENCKELMAN WAS ALWAYS IN CONTROL OF 
THE SITUATION ONCE IT LEFT THE 
LEFT FOOT OF MUNTARI HE KNEW IT 
WAS DIPPING OVER L. WAS NOT QUITE 
SURE MYSELF 
GOOD LEFT FOOT 
SULLEY MUNTARI INTO THE LAST TWENTY MINUTES OF THE NINETIES 
OF THE NINETY 
DID THAT CLIPPED THE 
OF THE NINETY DID THAT CLIPPED THE POST IT WAS NICE RUN BY NUGENT 
HE SAVED IT IT 
WAS GOING IN THERE THERE WAS A SAVE YES AS THEY LINE UP 
FOR THE CORNER HREIDARSSON HAS 
JOINED CAMPBELL AND GLEN JOHNSON 
JOHNSON GOT UP 
IF HREIDARSSON HAD 
HAD HIS FORWARD HEAD ON HE WAS 
JUST THINKING AS A DEFENDER AND WAS 
CAUGHT ON HIS HEELS IF HE HAD 
GAMBLED HE MIGHT HAVE GOT ON THE 
END OF THE KNOCK BACK WORTH AN EFFORT THE CROSS WAS CLEARED BY DISTIN FOR A CORNER RAMSEY HAS GONE ACROSS TO TAKE IT THOMPSON WAS JUMPING AND COMING IN 
BEHIND HIM LOOVENS AGAIN THE THE PROBLEM WAS THAT HE HEADED IT INTO 
THE GROUND IN FRONT OF HIM BUT YET 
AGAIN A CARDIFF HEAD ON THE BALL 
FROM A SET PIECE IN PORTSMOUTH'S 
BOX THAT IS DANGEROUS FOR 
PORTSMOUTH 
THE TWO CENTRAL PORTSMOUTH DEFENDERS HAVE BEEN THREATS 
JOHNSON AND LOOVENS 
THEY HAVE 
ROBBIE FOWLER HE HAS BEEN OUT WITH 
A HIP INJURY SINCE THE TURN OF THE 
YEAR HE WAS ALWAYS PUSHING IT TO 
GET ON THE BENCH TODAY PLAY UP POMPEY THE CHIMES HAVE STARTED AGAIN DISTIN A GREAT RUN WHAT A GOAL 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
ALSO A GREAT 
TACKLE IT WAS A BRILLIANT RUN BY 
DISTIN WHEN HE FIRST GOT IT HE 
DID NOT HAVE OPTIONS SO DECIDED TO 
GO ALONE IT WAS A BRILLIANT TACKLE 
IN THE END 
IT WAS ROGER JOHNSON 
WHO MADE THE CHALLENGE BUT WHAT A 
THRILLING RUN FROM THE CENTRE BACK 
THERE IS THE INGRAVE THERE HE HAS 
NOT STARTED ETCHING YET WILL IT BE THE NAME OF PORTSMOUTH 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY NINE CAN 
CARDIFF CITY PRODUCE SOMETHING IN 
THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES THAT WAS A LET OFF FOR POMPEY BUT LOOK AT THE BREAK I REALLY THOUGHT RAMSEY MIGHT HAVE 
PULLED IT OUT OF THE FIRE FOR 
CARDIFF PORTSMOUTH BREATHE A SIGH 
OF RELIEF MCNAUGHTON IS INJURED 
HE IS HOBBLING BACK 
MAYBE HE HAS 
GOT CRAMP AFTER THAT RUN HE COULD 
NOT GET UP 
RAMSEY HAD TWO OPENINGS 
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO SHOOT ON 
THE SECOND ONE IT IS A BIT EARLY TO BE DOING THAT 
AND CARDIFF HAVE THE CHANCE TO GET 
THE BALL UPFIELD MCNAUGHTON JUST 
CANNOT RUN THERE WAS A DAFT FOULED BY DIARRA 
YELLOW CARD AS WELL THAT HAS 
GIVEN CARDIFF A CHANCE TO REALLY 
PUSH PORTSMOUTH RIGHT BACK WITH ONE 
MINUTE TO GO THE GOALKEEPER IS 
COMING UP ENCKELMAN 
HE IS GOING 
TO TAKE IT 
WHAT A FINISH THIS 
COULD BE TO THE SECOND HALF WHAT A BLOG GLEN JOHNSON A CORNER TO BE TAKEN BY RAMSEY IT IS A BIG FINISH BY CARDIFF DAVID JAMES THAT WAS A GREAT TAKE A AND PORTSMOUTH HAVE WON THE F. A. CUP 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AND 
HARRY REDKNAPP HAS LED THEM INTO 
EUROPE FOR THE FIRST TIME HARRY 
REDKNAPP RULES THE WAVES IN THE 
NAVAL TOWN OF PORTSMOUTH KANU THE 
GOALSCORER 
I THINK YOU WILL FIND HE WAS WAVING 
TO HIS WIFE VERY EMOTIONAL SCENES 
WELL MARK CARDIFF DID THEIR BIT
