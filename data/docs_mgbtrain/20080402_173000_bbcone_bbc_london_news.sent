OVERCHARGED 
SEVEN A KILO THAT IS A OVERCHARGED LOT 
MEDICAL EXPERTS CALL ON LOT DOWNING STREET TO HELP FUND 
TREATMENT OF A RARE LIFE 
THREATENING CONDITION THE THE 
POTHOLES DRIVING MOTORISTS TO 
DISTRACTION WHY OUR ROADS ARE IN 
NEED OF AN OVERHAUL PLUS WE ARE 
LIVE AT THE EMIRATES AT ARSENAL 
TAKE ON LIVERPOOL IN A CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE CLASH 
GOOD EVENING WELCOME 
FOR MANY PASSENGERS IT'S A 
PAINSTAKING PROCESS ENSURING YOU 
DON'T GO OVER YOUR EXCESS BAGGAGE 
LIMIT BUT IT'S NOW EMERGED 
THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS WHO HAVE 
THRONE FROM GATWICK AIRPORT HAVE 
BEEN MISTAKENLY OVERCHARGED BECAUSE 
OF FAULTY SCALES A SPOT CHECK 
CARRIED OUT BY TRADING STANDARDS 
OFFICERS REVEALED ONE IN FIVE OF 
THEM SHOWED BAGS TO BE HEAVIER THAN 
THEY ACTUALLY WERE 
FLYING WITH EXCESS BAGGAGE CAN BE 
EXPENSIVE NOW TRADING STANDARDS 
HAVE FOUND THAT ONE IN FIVE OF THE 
SCALES AT GATWICK AIRPORT USE TODAY 
WEIGH BAGS WERE INACCURATE THAT 
MEANT PASSENGERS WERE PAYING MORE 
THAN THEY SHOULD 
IF I WAS THE ONE 
IN FIVE BEING CHARGED ON INACCURACY 
I WOULD BE CROSS AND FED UP 
BRITAIN IS NOT VERY FAIR ANY WAY 
IT'S ALL RIGHT TO LIVE BUT WE ARE 
GETTING OVERCHARGED FOR EVERYTHING 
THEY DID THAT ONE TIME AND I THINK 
IT WAS ALREADY ON A LEVEL BEFORE WE 
PUT THE BAGGAGE ON 
YOU WERE 
OVERCHARGED 
EIGHT A KILO RYANAIR OVERCHARGED RYANAIR CHARGES EIGHT POINT FIVE OH PER KILL GREEM IF A 
BAG IS OVERWEIGHT KILOGRAM 
THE EQUIPMENT IS RUN BY B. A. A. IT 
SAYS IT ABIDES BY LEGISLATION AND 
PROVIDES THE AIRLINES WITH 
INFORMATION ON HOW TO USE THE 
SCALES PROPERLY TRADING STANDARDS 
SAY THE INACCURATE READINGS ARE DUE 
TO HUMAN ERROR AND PROBLEMS WITH 
THE MACHINES ALTHOUGH THIS TIME 
THEY DIDN'T NAME ANY AIRLINES THEY 
SAY IN THE FUTURE THEY WILL NAME 
AND SHAME IF CONDITIONS DON'T 
IMPROVE THE AIRLINES SAY THEY WORK 
HARD TO TRAIN STAFF AND RECALIBRATE 
THE SCALES EVERY YEAR TRADING 
STANDARDS SAY ALTHOUGH PERHAPS NOT 
DELIBERATE AIRLINES COULD HAVE 
MADE BIG PROFITS OUT OF THE ERRORS 
CONSUMERS DO NOT REALISE WHEN THEY 
GO TO AN AIRLINE THEY HAVE ALL 
SORTS OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT 
THEY DON'T THINK OF LOOKING AT THE 
LITTLE INDICATION ON THE SCALES 
BEFORE THEY PUT THEIR BAGGAGE ON 
IF THEY LOOKED AT THAT AND SAW IT 
WAS ZERO THEY WILL BE O. K. SO OFTEN 
AND DURING OUR INVESTIGATION WE 
FOUND THERE WERE INDICATIONS 
ALREADY ON THAT SCALE WHICH MEANT 
THAT YOU AND YOUR BAGGAGE WERE 
OVERWEIGHT AND YOU HAD TO PAY EXTRA 
OTHER AIRPORTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY 
THE INACCURACIES SAY TRADING 
STANDARDS THEIR ADVICE CHECK THE 
SCALES ARE SET TO ZERO BEFORE 
PUTTING ON YOUR BAGS OR YOUR TRIP 
COULD GET MORE EXPENSIVE PLENTY 
MORE AHEAD INCLUDING CULTURE 
CLASS HOW AFRICAN MASS EYE 
WARRIORS ARE BEING PREPARED FOR 
THEIR FIRST TRIP TO THE CAPITAL 
NOW THEY ARE THE BAIN OF BOTH 
MOTORISTS AND CYCLISTS POTHOLES 
ACCORDING TO NEW SURVEY THERE ARE 
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM IN LONDON 
THAT IS ROUGHLY SIXTY FIVE HOLES PER MILE 
AND IT'S A LONG WAIT BEFORE THEY 
ARE FIXED BUT ON AVERAGE ROADS TAKE 
THIRTY FOUR YEARS TO BE RESURFACED OUR 
REPORTER IS IN BLOOMSBURY COMPLETE 
WITH POTHOLES I SEE YES YES ABSOLUTELY YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK 
VERY HARD TO FIND A POTHOLE IF YOU 
FEEL LIKE YOU ARE SEEING MORE OF 
THEM THEN YOU ARE PROBABLY RIGHT 
BLAME THEM OR NOT UTILITY 
COMPANIES ARE NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR 
NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND POTHOLES IN LONDON 
THE PROBLEM THE MORE TIMES THEY 
DIG UP THE ROADS THE MORE HOLES 
THEY GET AND THAT IS FRUSTRATING A 
LOT OF PEOPLE 
IT'S BAD NEWS FOR 
HIS SUSPENSION AND HIS AND DRIVERS 
ACROSS LONDON ARE SUFFERING THE 
SAME FATE GO TO ANY BOROUGH AND ON 
AVERAGE THERE ARE MORE FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
POTHOLES IN EVERY SINGLE ONE IT'S IT'S REALLY A PAIN IN THE NECK THE 
MAJORITY OF THE CARS WE REPAIR THE 
MAJORITY OF THE DAMAGE IS DONE BY 
THE POTHOLES 
THERE IS A LOT OF BIG 
HOLES NOW THERE ARE HUGE HOLES 
EVERYWHERE 
IT'S FRUSTRATING EVERYWHERE BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE WALKING OR 
CYCLING THERE IS BIG HOLE IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND YOU HAVE TO 
GO AROUND IT AND THEY SEEM TO HAVE 
GOT MORE AND MORE AND MORE 
THE THE 
NEW RESEARCH HAS FOUND IN LONDON 
THERE IS NOW AN ELEVEN YEAR BACKLOG FOR 
ROAD REPAIRS AND IT'S LIKELY TO GET 
WORSE 
BASICALLY NOTHING HAS WORSE IMPROVED OR VERY LITTLE IF AT ALL 
WE ARE STILL SEEING A SHORT FALL IN 
FUNDING NATIONALLY OF ONE BILLION 
IN LONDON THAT BOILS DOWN TO OVER 
FOUR MILLION PER AUTHORITY THE THE POTHOLES ARE NOT JUST ANNOYING BUT 
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS LAST YEAR 
COUNCILS IN LONDON HAD TO PAY OUT 
MORE THAN TWENTY TWO MILLION TO PEOPLE WHO 
HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS 
BECAUSE OF ROAD SURFACES IT'S 
CYCLISTS WHO CAN OFTEN SUFFER THE 
MOST ADAM HAS GOT HIS EYES OPEN 
AND SO HAVE THE PEOPLE REPORTING 
POTHOLES TO THE NEW WEBSITE HE 
HELPS RUN 
YOU CAN DAMAGE YOUR BIKE 
OR COME OFF AND HURTIER SELF A 
GOOD PERCENTAGE OF THE NUMBER OF 
CLAIMS THAT WE SEE ARE FOR DAMAGES 
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH 
POTHOLES 
GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASED POTHOLES FUNDING TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO 
SPEND ON ROADS BUT OFTEN IT'S USED 
FOR OTHER THINGS UNTIL THAT 
CHANGES A JOURNEY ACROSS LONDON 
WILL BE A BUMPY RIDE WELL QUITE A 
LOT OF DAMAGE TO SUSPENSIONS HERE 
THIS EVENING THERE IS A LITTLE BIT 
OF GOOD NEWS THAT IS THAT BECAUSE 
OF NEW LEGISLATION SOME OF THE 
UTILITY COMPANIES WHICH ARE DIGGING 
UP THESE ROADS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
START APPLYING FOR PERMITS SO THAT 
WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE 
ROADS ARE DUG UP AND IF THE WORK 
GOES ON TOO LONG THEY COULD BE 
FINED FINGERS CROSSED 
TWO OFFICERS WHO WERE REQUIRED TO 
RESIGN AFTER THEIR HANDLING OF THE 
STABBING OF YOUNG FATHER PETER 
WOODHAM HAVE BEEN REINSTATED TO THE 
POLICE HE WAS SHOT IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AFTER 
CHALLENGING YOUTHS IN CANNING TOWN 
THE OFFICERS WHO PREVIOUSLY 
ADMITTED TO FAILINGS IN THEIR 
PERFORMANCE AND DUTIES HAVE THEIR 
PUNISHMENTS REDUCED AFTER A REVIEW 
CAMPAIGNERS FOR BETTER TREATMENTS 
FOR A LIFE THREATENING LUNG 
CONDITION HAVE TAKEN THEIR ARGUMENT 
TO DOWNING STREET IT COMES AFTER 
THE BODY RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROVING 
N. H. S. MEDICINES SAID SOME DRUGS USED 
FOR ACUTE PULMONARY HYPE TENSION 
ARE TOO SUSPENSIVE THIS MAN HAS 
LIVED WITH THE DISEASE SINCE HE WAS 
A CHILD BUT TREATMENT WITH A 
COMBINATION OF DRUGS HAS RECENTLY 
TRANSFORMED HIS LIFE 
THIS KIND OF 
ILLNESS IS INCURABLE SO WITHOUT 
THESE MEDICATIONS AT LEAST IT GIVES 
US A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE HOW CAN 
I SAY IT IT MAKES US THINK ABOUT 
THE FUTURE WHAT WE CAN DO IN LIFE 
UNTHINKABLE JUST FEW YEARS AGO 
AND NOW THE FUTURE NOW INCLUDES A 
WIFE THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIS LUNG 
CONDITION IS AN ENLARGED LEFT 
VENTRICLE OF THE HEART IN THE END 
THE PRESSURE BUILDUP LEADS TO HEART 
FAILURE CLINICIANS SAY THEY'VE 
DEVELOPED A GOLD STANDARD TREATMENT 
FOR THIS RARE DISEASE WHICH IS THE 
ENVY OF THE WORLD 
INEVITABLY WHEN 
DRUGS ARE USED IN A SMALLER NUMBER 
OF PATIENTS THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE 
MORE EXPENSIVE AND IT IS THE COST 
OF CARING FOR THE PATIENTS THAT IS 
ALSO HUGE BUT NOBODY IS MEASURING 
THAT IT'S JUST TAKING ONE ITEM OUT 
OF THEIR CARE AND MEASURING THE 
COST OF THAT L. SUSPECT THAT IS NOT 
A FAIR WAY OF ASSESSING A RARE 
DISEASE 
THE BODY RESPONSIBLE FOR DISEASE ENSURING N. H. S. MONEY ON TREATMENT IS 
SPENT WISELY NICE SAY ALTHOUGH 
EXISTING PATIENTS CAN CONTINUE TO 
RECEIVE THE DRUGS THEY BELIEVE 
THERE IS A MORE COST EFFECTIVE 
TREATMENT IN THE FUTURE PATIENTS 
SHOULDN'T GET IT TODAY EXISTING 
SUFFERERS HELPED LAUNCHED A 
PARLIAMENTARY CHALLENGE TO THAT AND 
HANDED IN A THIRTY THOUSAND SIGNATURE 
PETITION TO THE PRIME MINISTER WE WE HAVE A DRUG HERE WHICH IS ADMITTED 
BY NICE TO BE EFFECTIVE AND 
PRESCRIBED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND BEEN 
WORKING BRILLIANTLY FOR MANY 
PATIENTS KEEPING THEM ALIVE AND 
THEY ARE SAYING PURELY ON THE 
GROUNDS OF COST THAT THEY SHOULD NO 
LONGER BE PRESCRIBED L. THINK THAT 
IS WRONG 
NO ONE DISPUTES YOU WILL 
MOANARY HYPER TENSION IS A LIFE 
THREATENING CONDITION AND THE 
REASON THE DEBATE IS HERE IS 
BECAUSE THOSE WHO TREAT THE 
CONDITION SAY THOSE DECIDING WHAT 
IS AFFORDABLE HAVE GOT THE BALANCE 
OF THEIR DECISION WRONG 
KEN LIVINGSTONE SAYS IF BORIS 
JOHNSON IS ELECTED MAYOR OF LONDON 
HE'LL REATE A HOUSING CRISIS HE 
SAYS THE CONSERVATIVE PLANS WOULD 
CUT THE LEVEL OF SOCIAL RENTED 
HOUSES IN LONDON MR. JOHNSON SAYS 
CURRENT POLICIES HAVE FAILED TO GET 
HOMES BUILT 
BARK BARNET IS ONE OF HIS FAVOURITE 
PASTIME AND THE CONSERVATIVE RUN 
COUNCIL WHAT HIS SIGHT AGAIN ONLY 
ONE IN TEN OF THE HOMES BUILT HERE 
LAST YEAR COULD BE CLASSIFIED AS 
AFFORDABLE THE WORST RATE IN 
LONDON HE HAS DOUBLED THE NUMBER 
OF AFFORDABLE HOMES IN LONDON BUT 
AS FALLEN SHORT OF HIS OWN FIFTY PER CENT 
TARGET HE SAID BORIS JOHNSON'S 
PROMISE TO GET RID OF THE TARGET 
ALL TOGETHER WOULD BE A RETURN TO 
DARK DAYS 
THIS IS THE LADY PORTER 
WESTMINSTER SCANDAL 
THERE ARE 
PLENTY OF GOOD HOMES THAT HAVE NOT 
BEEN BUILT AND COULD HAVEN BUILT IF 
WE WERE MORE FLEXIBLE 
BORIS YOU 
CAN'T MAKE IT UP AS YOU GO ALONG 
THEY CLASHED LAST NIGHT OVER THE 
ISSUE 
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE FAR ISSUE MORE FLEXIBLE AND PRAGMATIC THAT 
IS THE WAY TO GET MORE AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING BUILT 
WHAT WE NEED IS 
AFFORDABLE RENTED ACCOMMODATION 
NOT AT MARKET RENTS BUT RENTS THAT 
ARE CONTROLLED EITHER BY LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES OR HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS 
BORISION SON IS PLEDGE ING TO HELP 
MORE PEOPLE ON TO THE HOUSING 
LADDER WITH TWENTY PER CENT DISCOUNTS ON NEW 
HOMES HIS OPPONENTS SAY IT WOULD 
HELP THE BETTER OFF HE SAYS NO 
JUST GROUP WHO ARE CURRENTLY 
MISSING OUT 
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE 
ON THE AVERAGE INCOME IN LONDON WHO 
DO NOT QUALIFY FOR INTERMEDIATE 
SCHEMES OR SOCIALLY RENTED COME 
DECISION AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR KEY 
WORKER SCHEMES THOSE ARE THE 
PEOPLE WE WANT TO HELP 
HIS IS A 
ONE BEDROOM FLAT HIS A HOUSE WHICH 
HE QUIT LAST NIGHT WAS WORTH SHED 
LOADS HE'S LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE 
FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AND DOESN'T 
INTEND TO MOVE HE WOULD LIKE TO 
KEEP HIS JOB TOO TIM JOINS US NOW 
FROM CITY HALL HOUSING CLEARLY AN 
ISSUE THAT DIVIDES THEM WHAT 
HAPPENED NEXT IS THIS ABOUT BORIS 
JOHNSON BEING ACCUSED OF RUNNING 
SCARED OF DEBATE 
THIS IS A REFRAIN 
WE HAVE HEARD SOME TIME FROM THE 
MAYOR'S CAMP BORIS JOHNSON HAS 
PULLED OUT OF A HUSTINGS ORGANISED 
BY TIME OUT A MAGAZINE THIS 
EVENING AND KEN LIVINGSTONE AND THE 
OTHERS ARE SAYING HE CAN'T AFFORD 
TO AND HE SHOULDN'T MISS THE BIG 
SET PIECE DEBATES BECAUSE HE NEEDS 
TO BE THERE TO HAVE HIS POLICIES 
PROBED 
I WANT TO PERSONALLY PROBED CHALLENGE HIM ON SOME OF HIS 
RIDICULOUS ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES 
AND THE PEOPLE WHO SET THEM UP WANT 
TO SCRUTINISE HIM IF HE IS SERIOUS 
ABOUT BEING THE NEXT MAYOR WE NEED 
TO BE ABLE TO SCRUTINISE THE 
POLICIES AND CROSS QUESTION HIM AND 
HE'S NOT GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY 
BORIS JOHNSON REJECTS THIS AND SAYS 
HE HAS A PRIOR ENGAGEMENT HE IS 
MEETING LOCAL NEWSPAPER EDITORS HE 
SAID HE IS AVAILABLE FOR INTERVIEW 
OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN DAILY ONE MORE 
THING TO TELL YOU THERE IS ANOTHER 
POLL OUT TOMORROW THIS ONE BY I. C. M. 
IN THE GUARDIAN AND I'M TOLD IT 
SUGGESTS THAT BORIS JOHNSON IS JUST 
ONE PER CENT POINT AHEAD OF KEN LIVINGSTONE 
YOU WILL REMEMBER TWO POLLS SHOWED 
HIM AHEAD BY TEN AND TWELVE POINTS AND 
KEN LIVINGSTONE CRITICISED AND WAS 
UNHAPPY WITH ITS METHODOLOGY HE 
WILL GET A CONSIDERABLE BOOST FROM 
THIS POLL TOMORROW AND AS ONE

AUDIENCE JUST E. MAIL US GIVE US 
YOUR NAME AND QUESTION AND DETAILS 
ON HOW TO CONTACT YOU STILL TO 
COME TONIGHT 
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU 
WHY LONDON STILL MEANS A HECK OF A 
LOT TO ME 
IT'S THE BIGGEST TORCH RELAY THE 
LIMB PAICKS HAS SEEN SO FAR AND 
TURNING INTO THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL 
AS THE BEIJING TORCH IS CARRIED 
THROUGH LONDON ON SUNDAY GORDON 
BROWN WILL WELCOME THE TORCH 
OUTSIDE DOWNING STREET AND TODAY WE 
FOUND OUT MORE NAMES OF THE EIGHTY 
PEOPLE WHO WILL CARRY IT THROUGH

YACHTSWOMAN NEWSREADER TREVOR 
MCDONALD AND THE VIOLINIST 
VANIESIA MAE AND ONE YOUNG 
SPRINTER IS VICTOR ADE DAVIS WE 
SENT HIM TO GREECE TO FIND OUT 
ABOUT THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
AMID THE LOUDEST CHEERS OF THE 
AFTERNOON THE FAME WAS BORNE INTO 
THE ARENA AND RAISED ALOFT FOR A 
MOMENT OF SALOUTATION 
DRN SALOUTATION DRN SALOUTATION THE FIRST TORCH OF THE MODERN 
OLYMPICS STARTED IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX 
THE FLAME 
WAS WORKED OUT IN THE MODERN TIMES 
TO PROMOTE THE OLYMPIC GAMES AND 
IT'S A GREAT IDEA YOU LIGHT THE 
FLAME IN THE SOURCE OF THE ANCIENT 
GAMES AND TAKE IT TO THE PLACE 
WHERE THE MODERN GAMES ARE TO BE 
HELD AND THAT IS WHAT THEY DID FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX AND THE IDEA 
CAUGHT ON 
ALL THE IMPORTANT PEOPLE 
FOR THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT ARE HERE 
FOR THE FLAME LIGHTING CEREMONY 
WE'RE GOING TO WATCH A DRESS 
REHEARSAL REHEARSAL YOU SEE THE FLAME AND STUFF ON T. V. 
ALL THE TIME 
NOW I'M ACTUALLY IN GREECE WATCHING 
IT LIVE AS IT IS HAPPENING IT'S 
DIFFERENT YOU GET MORE INVOLVED 
WITH WHAT IS GOING ON IT'S GOOD FEELING FEELING THAT WAS JUST A DRESS REHEARSAL 
THE QUESTION IS IS IT GOING TO GO 
THAT WELL TOMORROW 
IN FACT IT DIDN'T GO AS PLANNED 
THE EVENT WAS DISRUPTED BY PRO 
TIBETAN PROTESTERS AND MADE 
HEADLINES AROUND THE WORLD 
IT WAS INSPIRING BECAUSE THAT IS 
WHAT IS GOING TO COME BACK THROUGH 
LONDON AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO 
CARRY CARRY IT GOES THROUGH TWENTY ONE COUNTRIES AND 
TRAVELS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND KILOMETRES AND IN 
THIRTEEN DAYS I'M GOING TO GET TO CARRY 
THE TORCH 
AN ELATED VICTOR THERE BUT MIKE 
ON ANOTHER NOTE WE HEARD EARLIER 
THIS WEEK ABOUT SECURITY 
ARRANGEMENTS FOR A POSSIBLE PROTEST 
ANY MORE NEWS ON THAT 
THERE IS 
THIS WIDE SPREAD EXPECTATION OF 
SOME FORM OF PROTEST ALONG THE 
ROUTE IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS WE 
SAW PERHAPS IN ATHENS BUT WE'VE 
JUST HEARD THAT THE TORCH IS GOING 
TO BE WELCOMED IN DOWNING STREET BY 
GORDON BROWN SOME TIME OVER SUNDAY 
LUNCHTIME SO THAT WILL BE AN 
INTENSELY POLITICAL PART OF THIS 
YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE EVENTS ON 
SUNDAY IN OUR SPECIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
PROGRAMME AT ONE THOUSAND TWENTY ON B. B. C. ONE 
NOW DON'T RRY YOUR SPEAR ON THE 
STREET DON'T CHASE ANIMALS AND 
MAKE SURE YOU WEAR UNDERPANTS 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT THAT IS JUST 
SOME OF THE ADVICE BEING GIVEN TO 
AFRICAN WARRIORS COMING TO THE 
CAPITAL FOR THE FIRST TIME TO RUN 
THE LONDON MARATHON SO WHAT WILL 
GREET THE MASSAI MEN WHO HAVE NEVER 
LEFT THEIR VILLAGE BEFORE 
MASSAI IN NORTHERN TANZANIA 
INSTINCTIVE WARRIORS WITH A DIET OF 
BLOOD AND MILK LONDONERS FIGHTING 
THEIR WAY TO WORK WITH A DIET OF 
BEER AND T. V. DINNERS WORLDS APART 
BUT NOT FOR LONG SIX MASSAI MEN 
WHO HAVE NEVER LEFT THEIR VILLAGE 
BEFORE ARE FLYING IN TO RUN THE 
LONDON MARATHON 
THEY LIVE IN A 
VILLAGE OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE AND KNOW ALL 
THE NAMES OF EVERYONE AND THEY HAD 
TO COME IN A LAND ROVER TO SEE 
MORE THAN TWO VEHICLES TOGETHER 
WILL AN SHOCK 
ALL THIS WILL BE 
COMPLETELY ALIEN TO THE WARRIORS 
SO THE CHARITY ORGANISING THEIR 
VISIT HAS ISSUED THIS CULTURAL 
BRIEFING GIVING KEY POINTERS ABOUT 
WHAT THEY SHOULD EXPECT MANY MANY PEOPLE IN ENGLAND DRINK ALCOHOL 
WHEN THEY DO YOU CAN SEEM 
DIFFERENT AND ACT UP 
EVEN THOUGH LONDONERS MAY LOOK A 
BIT MISERABLE WE'RE REALLY QUITE 
FRIENDLY BUNCH IT'S JUST BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE TO GO TO WORK EVERY DAY 
YOU CAN'T RELY ON THE SUN TO TELL 
YOU IS TIME BECAUSE NUMBER ONE 
THE WEATHER IS REALLY BAD SO YOU 
NEED TO USE YOUR WATCH 
SO WE'RE A 
GROUP OF DRINKERS AND BAD TEMPERED 
IS THAT FAIR 
WE'RE JUST IN A HURRY 
I'M SURE IF THEY STOP AND ASK US 
WHERE TO GO WE'RE QUITE FRIENDLY 
THEY WILL BE HERE TO RAISE MONEY TO 
SUPPLY CLEAN WATER TO THE VILLAGE 
THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY CATTLE THIEVES 
AND THEY WON'T MIND ME SAYING THAT 
SO THEY STEAL CATTLE FROM ONE 
VILLAGE AND RUN LIKE HELL BACK TO 
THEIR OWN VILLAGE SO THEY ARE USED 
TO IT BUT RUNNING ON OUR ROADS 
WILL BE DIFFERENT 
AND ADD TO THAT 
WE LIKE FOOTBALL TONIGHT IT IS AN 
ALL ENGLISH AFFAIR AS ARSENAL MEET 
LIVERPOOL FOR A PLACE IN THE LAST 
FOUR OF THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE THE 
TWO CLUBS MEET IN THE FIRST LEG OF 
THEIR QUARTER FINAL AT THE EMIRATES 
STADIUM IT IS A BIG NIGHT 
GERAINT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE GERAINT OF THE ODD PHRASES YOU HEAR IN 
SPORT IS OUR NAME IS ON THE CUP 
THIS SEASON I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY 
KNOW THAT BUT THAT IS SOMETHING 
THAT ARSENAL STARTED TO TALK ABOUT 
AFTER THEIR VICTORY OVER A. C. MILAN 
LAST MONTH AND THEY HOLD NO FEAR 
AND ARSENAL AND LIVERPOOL WILL HAVE 
TO GET QUITE USED TO EACH OTHER 
OVER THE COMING WEEK 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEXT TEN DAYS 
THAT WILL DEFINE OUR SEASON 
BECAUSE I STRONGLY BELIEVE WE ARE 
IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP RACE AND OUR 
NEXT TWO GAMES IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
ARE LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER UNITED 
AND JUST ON TOP OF THAT WE PLAY 
TWO CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES AGAINST 
LIVERPOOL SO OUR NEXT TEN DAYS 
WILL BE VITAL 
HE'S NOT WRONG YOU KNOW THE LINE 
BETWEEN HERO AND ZERO IS RATHER 
THIN BUT KEEP ONE THING IN MIND 
ARSENE WENGER IS A MAN ON A MISSION 
HE'S WON EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE AND FOLLOWING 
ARSENAL'S OUTSTANDING VICTORY OVER 
MILAN IN THE LAST ROUND TWO TO ZERO TWO TO ZERO WILL HE NOW BELIEVE THEY CAN WIN 
IT IS A BIG BIG GAME IN THE SERIES 
AND PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING IT TO BE 
AND I'M CONFIDENT IT WILL BE 
BECAUSE WE PLAY AND LIVERPOOL PLAY 
AT A HIGH PACE SO IT SHOULD BE A 
VERY INTERESTING GAME 
WE HAVE A 
LOT OF CONFIDENCE AND WE'RE WINNING 
FIVE LOT OF GAMES IN A ROW AND PLAYING 
WELL SO I THINK WE ARE IN A GOOD 
MOMENT AND TORRES CAN BE A BIG 
DIFFERENCE
