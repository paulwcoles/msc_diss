SO LET'S SEE IS THIS CAR GOOD ENOUGH TO WEAR THE FLYING LADY 
OR SHALL WE KEEP HER HIDDEN IN SHAME 
THIS IS NICE NO REV COUNTER I HAVE A POWER RESERVE DIAL 
I'M DOING SIXTY MILES AN HOUR AND ACCORDING TO THAT 
I'VE GOT NINETY PER CENT OF THE ENGINE'S POWER IN RESERVE JUST IN CASE OF EMERGENCIES THAT'S GOOD 
IN THE OLD ROLLS ROYCES THE ONES FROM THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES EIGHTIES EVEN 
THERE WAS WIND NOISE TYRE NOISE ENGINE NOISE 
YOU COULD HEAR THE CLOCK AT ONE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR BECAUSE IT WAS SO LOUD 
BUT THIS IS LIKE A WHISPER IN THE VESTRY 
IT'S QUIETER AND MORE ECONOMICAL THAN I EXPECTED 
AND IT'S EASIER TO DRIVE 
I IMAGINED THAT DRIVING THIS CAR THROUGH A VILLAGE 
WOULD BE LIKE TRYING TO THREAD AN OIL RIG THROUGH A LETTER BOX 
BUT IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT IT'S FOURTEEN MILES LONG 
BUT IT'S QUITE NARROW IT'S SIX INCHES NARROWER THAN A RANGE ROVER SO IT'S QUITE EASY 
I'M NOT DISTRACTED BY TOYS EITHER 
IN MOST LUXURY CARS THERE ARE LOTS OF BUTTONS WHICH LET YOU TAILOR EVERYTHING JUST SO 
LET ME SHOW YOU THE RADIO AS A PRIME EXAMPLE THERE'S ONE KNOB 
PUSH IT AND TERRY WOGAN COMES INTO THE CAR TURN IT HE GETS LOUDER 
PUSH IT AGAIN AND HE GOES AWAY 
THEN THERE'S THE GEAR ARRANGEMENT 
TIPTRONIC I DON'T THINK SO I'VE GOT BACKWARDS NEUTRAL AND FORWARDS AND THAT'S IT 
IT SEEMS THIS CAR REPRESENTS AN OLD FASHIONED APPROACH TO LUXURY MOTORING 
AND I RATHER LIKE THAT 
NORMALLY I MUST BE HONEST I DON'T FIND THE DOORS ON A CAR PARTICULARLY INTERESTING UNLESS 
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY BUT LOOK AT THIS 
NOT ONLY DOES THIS OPEN BACKWARDS BUT IN HERE WE FIND 
AN UMBRELLA 
ROLLS ROYCE IS MAKING A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS NOT SURE WHY COS YOU GET IT 
ON A SKODA SUPERB IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'S SUPERB ABOUT IT 
INSIDE I SIMPLY PUSH THIS BUTTON HERE TO CLOSE THE DOOR BECAUSE 
OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO DO IT MYSELF 
THEN I'M COCOONED IN THIS WORLD OF ELEGANT SIMPLICITY 
I LOVE THE LEATHER AND ALUMINIUM 
THIS ART DECO LIGHT IN HERE THE HANDLES AND THE ROOF 
THAT IS FABULOUS 
THEN YOU'VE GOT THE THICK CARPETS AND THESE PICNIC TABLES 
YOU MIGHT THINK THAT THE BACK IS THE BEST PLACE TO BE 
CALMING NICE 
BUT ACTUALLY THE ROLLS IS AMAZINGLY GOOD FUN TO DRIVE 
NOUGHT TO SIXTY IN FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS 
AND A TOP SPEED OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THAT'S FAST BY ANYONE'S STANDARDS ESPECIALLY AS THE WHEELS DON'T APPEAR TO GO ROUND 
AND IT'S NOT JUST GOOD IN A STRAIGHT LINE EITHER 
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME IT'S FAR FROM SPORTY 
BUT IT'S NOT A HOVERCRAFT EITHER 
I DIDN'T WANT TO LIKE THIS CAR 
I WANTED TO SAY IT WAS TOO BIG TOO GERMAN TOO VULGAR BUT IT'S WON ME OVER 
SINCE IT BEGAN ROLLS ROYCE SAID IT MAKES THE BEST CAR IN THE WORLD 
NOW FOR EIGHTY YEARS THAT HASN'T REALLY BEEN THE CASE 
IT IS NOW THOUGH 
ONCE AGAIN THE SPIRIT OF ECSTASY IS JUST THAT 
AND HERE WE ARE AT JOURNEY'S END 
FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS THE LONGEST SUSPENSION BRIDGE IN THE WORLD 
THE TOWERS ARE ONE AND A HALF INCHES FURTHER APART AT THE TOP THAN THE BOTTOM 
THANKS TO THE CURVATURE OF THE EARTH 
THERE'S ENOUGH STEEL IN THE CABLING HERE TO GO ROUND THE WORLD TWICE 
IT'S BRITISH STEEL BRITISH DESIGNED 
BRITISH ENGINEERED AND BRITISH BUILT WITH BRITISH MONEY 
WE HAVE THE TALENT IN THIS COUNTRY TO MAKE STUFF LIKE THIS 
SO WHY CAN'T WE DO IT TODAY 
THE DESIGN OF THIS CAR IS BRITISH 
THE CHIEF ENGINEER WHO WORKED ON IT IS BRITISH 
BUT THE ENGINE COMES FROM GERMANY 
SO DOES THE GEARBOX THE BRAKES THE SUSPENSION AND BODY 
EVEN THE LEATHER ON THE SEATS COMES FROM A FLOCK OF COWS IN BAVARIA 
ALL WE DO IN THIS COUNTRY IS PUT ALL THE BITS TOGETHER AND NAIL THE DASHBOARD IN PLACE 
IT'S PATHETIC 
THIS IS A GREAT CAR AN AWESOME CAR A BIT SHOWY PERHAPS 
AND HARD TO PARK BUT MOSTLY A MAJESTIC INSPIRING SERENE 
AND GLORIOUS BLEND OF STYLE AND ENGINEERING 
I JUST WISH IT WAS LIKE THE HUMBER BRIDGE 
I WISH IT WAS SOMETHING WE COULD BE PROUD OF 
HOW ARE YOU GOOD HAVE A SEAT 
SO LOBBED OUT OF THE S. A. S. PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO TELL US WHAT HAPPENED 
IT WAS ABOUT NINETEEN SIXTY SIX 
AND A FRIEND OF MINE DISCOVERED THAT BRITAIN'S MOST BEAUTIFUL VILLAGE 
CASTLE COMBE AND HAD BEEN VOTED AS SUCH WAS BEING DESECRATED BY TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX MAKING A FILM 
WHICH REQUIRED BUILDING A TWENTY FOOT HIGH CONCRETE DAM 
RUINING THIS LOVELY VILLAGE AND MY FRIEND DECIDED TO BRING THIS OUTRAGE TO THE GENERAL ATTENTION 
BY BLOWING IT UP 
ERM SO I LAID ALL THE CHARGES AND IT WAS QUITE SUCCESSFUL 
I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT DIDN'T GET PHYSICALLY CAUGHT 
AS I'D BEEN DOING AN ARMY COURSE ON HOW TO ESCAPE FROM DOGS AT NIGHT 
I WAS THROWN OUT OF THE S. A. S. BACK TO MY OWN REGIMENT BACK IN GERMANY 
HOW DID YOU GET THESE EXPLOSIVES OUT OF WHERE THEY'RE KEPT 
OH I SIGNED FOR THEM BUT THEN 
SAYING YOU WERE BLOWING UP WILTSHIRE 
YOU LEARN TO BLOW UP AS MUCH AS YOU CAN USING AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE 
I WAS GOOD AT THIS SO I HAD A LOT LEFT OVER AT THE END OF EVERY DAY 
AFTER THE ARMY YOU EMBARKED ON WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED 
AS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY SERIES OF ADVENTURES POSSIBLY EVER 
THE GUINNESS BOOK OF RECORDS LIST YOU AS THE GREATEST LIVING EXPLORER 
THEY DID IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR I'VE GONE DOWNHILL SINCE THEN 
HARDLY FIRST HOVERCRAFT DESCENT OF THE LONGEST RIVER IN THE WORLD 
FIRST SURFACE JOURNEY AROUND THE WORLD'S POLAR AXIS 
FIRST HUMAN TO REACH BOTH POLES FIRST CROSSING OF THE ANTARCTICA 
FIRST UNSUPPORTED CROSSING OF THE ANTARCTIC CONTINENT 
AND THE FIRST WE'LL GET ON TO THAT LATER ON 
IT'S A NEVER ENDING STREAM OF STROLLING AROUND IN COLD PLACES 
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND UNSUPPORTED THAT'S CRITICAL 
YES THAT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE 
IT'S LIKE SCHUMACHER DOING A FORMULA ONE WITH NO SAFETY BELT OR HELMET 
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG HE'S STUCK 
IF IT GOES O. K. YOU'RE O. K. AND THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH YOU DO IT 
SO YOU'VE TRIED TO GO IT'S SOMETHING LIKE FIVE HUNDRED YARDS A DAY 
THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL HAVE ACHIEVED YES YOU CAN ONLY CARRY SO MUCH 
YOU NEED TO KNOW IN ADVANCE HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO DO FIVE HUNDRED MILES 
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE FIVE HUNDRED YARDS TO BEGIN WITH 
THEN YOU'VE GOT TO SPEED UP LATER ON 
SO MATHEMATICALLY IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE POSSIBLE OR IT'S NOT 
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG THEN YOU WON'T SUCCEED 
I'M JUST BAFFLED BY THIS NOTION WE'RE TALKING TEMPERATURES OF 
THE LOWEST WE EVER WENT TO AT SIX THOUSAND FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL IN ANTARCTICA 
WAS A WIND CHILL FACTOR OF MINUS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO DEGREES CENTIGRADE 
AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE HAD ON YOUR OWN IN THE ANTARCTIC 
RECENTLY YOU HAD THE MOMENT WHEN YOUR SLEDGE FELL INTO THE 
INTO AN UNFROZEN PIECE OF ARCTIC OCEAN YES 
THEN YOU GOT FROSTBITE PULLING IT OUT AND A DOCTOR SAID 
THE DOCTOR SAID YOU MUSTN'T AMPUTATE FOR FIVE MONTHS AFTER THE FROSTBITE 
TO ALLOW THE SEMI DEAD STUFF WHICH IS GOING TO FORM THE NEW FLAPS 
TO RESUSCITATE ITSELF OVER FIVE MONTHS YOU DIDN'T WAIT 
NO BECAUSE FOR FOUR MONTHS OF IT IT WAS VERY PAINFUL 
I HAD THESE BIG RED TALONS STICKING OUT AND IT'S DIFFICULT NOT TO TOUCH 
SO I THOUGHT GET RID OF THEM 
I TRIED WITH A HACKSAW AND IT DIDN'T DO IT SO I GOT A BLACK AND AMP DECKER 
FROM THE VILLAGE AND A MICRO BLADE AND I HACKED THEM OFF WHERE THE BLOOD AND SORENESS WAS AT HOME 
IN THE TOOL SHED YES 
AND THE PHYSIOTHERAPIST SAID I'D DONE A VERY GOOD JOB 
BUT THE SURGEON WHO WAS ITALIAN WAS NOT HAPPY 
HE THOUGHT YOU SHOULD'VE PERHAPS GONE TO HOSPITAL 
HE SAID IT WAS MAKING HIS JOB DOING THE FINAL SURGERY DIFFICULT 
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SUPERCAR 
AROUND THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND MARK YOU'RE PRETTY WELL CATERED FOR 
FOR THAT PRICE YOU'LL GET A LAMBORGHINI MURCIELAGO 
OR AN ASTON MARTIN VANQUISH 
AND IF YOU'RE AIMING TO SPEND OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
AGAIN THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF CHOICE WITH PAGANI ZONDAS 
MCLAREN S. L. R.'S AND PORSCHE CARRERA G. T.'S 
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM 
OUR OFFICE IS CONSTANTLY FLOODED WITH LETTERS FROM VIEWERS 
SAYING THEY WANT TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND ON A CAR 
THIS WEEK'S BATCH DEAR TOP GEAR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND IS TOO CHEAP 
I'D LIKE TO BUY A CAR THAT COSTS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
DEAR TOP GEAR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS TOO MUCH WHEN WILL YOU EXPERTS 
REALISE I WANT TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
DEAR TOP GEAR I WANT TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND ON A CAR ETC ETC 
THEY ALL GO ON IN THE SAME VEIN IT'S A GAP THAT'S NOT BEING FILLED 
UNTIL NOW 
THIS IS THE LITTLE SCAMP 
IT'S CALLED THE ASCARI K. Z. ONE 
AND IT'S A BRAND NEW SUPERCAR 
THAT COSTS YOU GUESSED IT 
AT FIRST GLANCE IT HAS ALL THE RIGHT INGREDIENTS 
IT'S FAST IT'S LOW THE DOOR COUNT STOPS AT TWO 
AND THOSE HUMUNGOUS SIDE VENTS MEAN THE ENGINE'S WHERE IT SHOULD BE 
IN THE MIDDLE 
SO JOB DONE THEN WELL ACTUALLY 
NO 
YOU SEE THE SUPERCAR WORLD IS LIKE AN ELITE CLUB 
WITH JUST A FEW SELECT NAMES IN IT 
ALL OF WHICH HAVE GOT THAT CERTAIN SOMETHING THAT SETS THEM APART 
IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR A NEW BOY TO JOIN THAT CLUB 
THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THE NAME 
IT SHOULD HAVE HERITAGE IT SHOULD DATE BACK TO THE NORMANS 
AND THAT'S HARD WHEN THE CAR'S NEW 
BUT DON'T WORRY BECAUSE ASCARI ISN'T JUST A COLLECTION OF LETTERS 
PLUCKED FROM THE SCRABBLE BAG NO 
THIS IS THE ORIGINAL ASCARI HE'S A MAN AND A SPECIAL ONE 
IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES ASCARI WAS THE FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPION TWICE OVER 
AND HE STILL HOLDS THE RECORD FOR WINNING EVERY SINGLE GRAND PRIX 
IN A SEASON HE IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF MOTOR SPORT PAST 
AND EVEN SURVIVED CRASHING INTO THE MONACO HARBOUR 
DURING THE NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE GRAND PRIX 
SO THE NAME IS WELL CHOSEN 
AND AS BEFITS THE MAN THE CAR HAS GOT SOME SERIOUS POKE 
THERE WE GO 
ONE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR FROM STANDSTILL IN JUST OVER EIGHT SECONDS 
SIXTY HAPPENED WELL OVER FOUR SECONDS AGO AND IT'S CLAIMED 
THE ASCARI WILL HIT THE SUPERCAR HOLY GRAIL 
OF TWO HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR 
SO IT HAS THE REQUIRED PERFORMANCE 
AND THERE ARE TWO GOOD REASONS FOR THIS BARN STORMING TURN OF SPEED 
FIRST UP THE ENGINE THERE'S THIS FIVE LITRE V. EIGHT FOUR WAY 
FROM THE B. M. W. M. FIVE 
RETUNED TO GIVE FIVE HUNDRED BRAKE HORSEPOWER 
IT'S BRUTAL 
IT SOUNDS METALLIC 
AND SECONDLY 
THERE'S NOT MUCH TO HOLD IT BACK 
THE BODY IS MADE OF CARBON FIBRE 
THE CHASSIS IS MADE OF CARBON FIBRE 
SO IT'S INCREDIBLY LIGHT 
IN FACT THIS THUNDERING GREAT MONSTER IS HALF A TON LIGHTER 
THAN THE MCLAREN S. L. R. 
SO THE ASCARI HAS A NAME WITH CRED 
AND BOASTS THE SPEED AND TECHNICAL PROWESS OF A PROPER SUPERCAR 
AND THERE'S ANOTHER THING THE OWNER HE'S AN INTERESTING CHAP 
A MYSTERIOUS MULTI MILLIONAIRE CALLED KLAAS ZWART 
WHAT IMAGE POPPED INTO YOUR MIND WHEN YOU HEARD THAT 
YES AND HIS ADDRESS IS TWENTY THREE THE HOLLOWED OUT VOLCANO 
BIT OF A WORRY THAT 
EVEN SO HE WOULD PROBABLY AGREE 
THAT OBSCURE CARS MADE IN SMALL NUMBERS ON INDUSTRIAL ESTATES 
ARE OFTEN LET DOWN BY CHEAP AND SHABBY INTERIORS 
OPEN THE DOOR AND YOU ENTER A WORLD OF GLUE AND FORD ESCORT SWITCHING 
NOT SO IN HERE 
ALL OF THIS SWITCH GEAR IS BESPOKE TO THE ASCARI 
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A COLLECTION OF BITS THEY FOUND IN A WHEELIE BIN 
OUTSIDE SOMEONE ELSE'S FACTORY 
SO FAR SO GOOD 
BUT WE'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET 
BECAUSE A GOOD SUPERCAR HAS TO HANDLE WELL 
NOW THE BASIC CAR COMES SET UP 
FOR A LITTLE BIT OF UNDERSTEER THAT'S A BIT SAFER 
BECAUSE KLAAS ZWART I THINK RIGHTLY OBSERVES 
THAT PEOPLE'S DRIVING SKILL DOESN'T NECESSARILY INCREASE 
WITH THEIR WALLET SIZE 
AS DEMONSTRATED HERE BY BRITAIN'S PREMIER SUPERMARKET RIBBON CUTTER 
IN THE MAIN THOUGH THIS IS A VERY EASY SUPERCAR TO DRIVE 
THERE IS NO TRACTION CONTROL NOTHING ELECTRONIC 
IN FACT THE ONLY THING KEEPING ME ON THE TRACK IT'S NOT TALENT 
IS GRIP 
JUST UNBELIEVABLE GRIP 
HOW IS IT STAYING 
I SHOULD BE OVER THERE HOW AM I STILL ON THE TRACK 
I'LL DO IT AGAIN TURN IN 
I'M BEING AN IDIOT NOW 
RIGHT NOW I SHOULD BE IN THOSE TREES 
WHERE MY EARDRUMS HAVE GONE BUT NO 
ON TOP OF THAT THE STEERING TALKS TO YOU LIKE IT SHOULD 
AND THE RIDE IS FOR A SUPERCAR SUPERB 
YOU CAN TELL THERE'S A REAL DEPTH OF ENGINEERING IN THIS CAR 
SO THE ASCARI HAS THE POWER THE HANDLING THE FIT AND FINISH 
AND THE TECHNOLOGY THAT ALL SUPERCARS MUST HAVE 
SURELY THEN ITS ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPERCAR CLUB IS GUARANTEED 
ER NO SADLY 
ONLY ONE NAME HAS MANAGED TO JOIN THE SUPERCAR CLUB IN RECENT YEARS 
AND THAT'S THE PAGANI ZONDA 
WHICH DID IT BY BEING AS MAD AS A BRUSH 
THE ASCARI IS JUST TOO SENSIBLE 
TOO MUCH THE ENGINEER'S CAR 
WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE IS LET THE ENGINEERS DO THEIR THING 
AND THEN GIVE IT OVER TO A TEN YEAR OLD KID TO FINISH IT OFF 
DRAW A FEW FINS AND GUNS ON IT THAT SORT OF THING 
THAT'S THE POINT OF SUPERCARS INSIDE EVERY SUPERCAR BUYER 
NO MATTER HOW MANY PETROCHEMICAL COMPANIES THEY OWN 
THERE IS A TEN YEAR OLD KID 
IT'S KIDS' STUFF IT'S OBVIOUS 
VERY GOOD 
THANK YOU VERY GOOD 
BUT I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT YOU DID FORGET ONE VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR 
WHAT IT'S BRITISH 
IT'S NAMED AFTER AN ITALIAN RACING DRIVER 
THE COMPANY IS OWNED BY A DUTCHMAN AND IT HAS A GERMAN ENGINE 
I KNOW BUT IT WAS ENGINEERED IN BRITAIN AND BUILT IN BANBURY 
WHICH I THINK YOU'LL FIND IS IN SURREY 
OXFORDSHIRE 
OXFORDSHIRE ANYWAY 
IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE SUPERCARS AT THE TOP OF OUR POWERBOARD 
YOU WILL SEE THAT IT IS UTTERLY DOMINATED BY ITALIANS GERMANS 
AMERICANS THE SWEDES FOR PETE'S SAKE THAT'S TRUE 
IT IS QUITE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET A BRITISH CAR 
TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE BOARD 
I DON'T THINK IT NEEDS TO GO TOO HIGH UP THE POWERBOARD 
MAYBE TO ABOUT THERE WOULD BE FINE ANY HIGHER AND IT'S JUST A WASTE 
AWAY HE GOES FOR QUEEN AND COUNTRY 
ALTHOUGH OF COURSE MANY DO BELIEVE THE STIG WAS ACTUALLY BORN IN SPACE 
THE TRACK IS A LITTLE DAMP IN PLACES DOWN TO THE FIRST CORNER 
HARD ON THE BRAKES LOTS OF TYRE SQUEAL THAT'S A WORRY 
AH I SHOULD EXPLAIN 
THAT STIG HAS DEVELOPED A STRANGE OBSESSION WITH BAROQUE CLASSICS 
RATHER SLOW ON THE WAY IN 
BUT GIVING IT THE BEANS ON THE WAY OUT GOOD BOY 
A BIG JITTERY ON THE BRAKING 
THIS COULD SHOW UP THE ASCARI'S UNDERSTEER 
BUT NO HOLDING IT TOGETHER NICELY 
AND KICKING THE TAIL OUT ON THE EXIT 
I HAVE TO SAY IT'S NOT LOOKING SUPERCAR QUICK SO FAR 
SHOULD SEE A BIT OF SPEED ON THE FOLLOW THROUGH THOUGH 
UP TOWARDS THE TYRES NEXT 
OH YES 
THAT IS EXTREMELY QUICK JUST TWO CORNERS TO GO NOW 
CAN THE ASCARI CLAIM A PLACE AT THE BUSINESS END OF OUR BOARD 
TAKING IT EASY FOR A DAMP PATCH BACK ON THE POWER 
COME ON STIGGY 
AND THE TIME IS ARE YOU READY FOR THIS 
THIS IS FOR THE NATION VERY IMPORTANT 
ONE M. I. N. U. T. E. TWENTY SEVEN 
WHICH IS ASTONISHING LOOK AT THAT IT GOES 
THE FIFTH FASTEST CAR ON OUR BOARD 
IS A BRITISH SUPERCAR 
THIS IS AN PROPER HONOUR TO HAVE YOU HERE 
I'M THRILLED I WATCH EVERY WEEK 
YOU'RE A FAN YES WHAT ELSE IS ON SUNDAY NIGHT 
MOST PEOPLE CAN FIND SOMETHING BETTER 
YOU SOUND LIKE A BLUE BLOOD 
BUT I'VE READ UP ON YOU AND THERE'S PETROL IN THOSE VEINS 
IT'S THERE SINCE I CAN REMEMBER I'VE LIKED CARS ABOVE DOLLS 
I HAD A GARAGE WHEN I WAS YOUNG 
I HAVE A COLLECTION OF TIN CARS 
YOUR FIRST LOVE WAS A ROLLS ROYCE YEAH WHY 
SOMEONE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND SAID THERE'S A CAR DOWN THERE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY 
IT'S A ROLLS YEAH FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY 
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY YEAH 
IT WAS A SILVER WRAITH NINETEEN FORTY NINE WITH BIG LUCAS HEADLAMPS 
THE WIPERS YOU HAD TO TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL AND START THEM 
I'M SURPRISED IT DIDN'T CATCH ON 
IF I HADN'T SHUT A DOOR PROPERLY IT WOULD FLY OPEN AND TAKE A CYCLIST 
YOU DID THE LUCIE CLAYTON FINISHING SCHOOL THING 
YEAH ABOUT HOW TO GET IN AND OUT OF CARS KNEES TOGETHER SMILE 
SITTING LIKE THAT YOU LEARN HOW NOT TO SHOW YOUR KNICKERS 
THEY THINK YOU'LL GO OUT IN AN E. TYPE JAG 
YOU NEVER GET A BOYFRIEND IN AN E. TYPE JAG NEVER MINE GO BY TUBE 
THAT WAS SAD AND A WASTE OF TIME AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SIT THERE 
IT'S SAD WOMEN JUST SITTING IN CARS 
THE CAR STOPS 
HERE'S THE RESTAURANT DEAR AND YOU SIT THERE DISABLED WHY 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN HANDLE CAN'T YOU GET OUT THEY SIT THERE LIKE THAT 
I SAT WITH SOMEONE AT DINNER SHE WOULDN'T POUR THE WINE I HATE THAT 
JUST POUR IT IF YOU'RE THIRSTY 
OR WAITERS WHO PUT THE BOTTLE OVER THERE I'VE PAID FOR IT 
AND BRING ANOTHER ONE YES 
WERE YOU NEVER TEMPTED BY EXOTIC FERRARIS 
I WAS SO TEMPTED BY AN EXOTIC FERRARI THAT MY HUSBAND AND I 
AT A CHARITY AUCTION YOU KNOW BOTTLE OF WINE THERE 
AND A RAFFLE THERE WE WENT OOH FERRARI 
ON THE TILT CRIMSON LID OFF AND YOU GO THAT'S GORGEOUS WHEN THE BIDDING STARTS 
YOUR ARM GOES LIKE THIS AFTER WINE WAITER ANOTHER BOTTLE 
SUDDENLY WE OWNED THE FERRARI WE OWNED A THREE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT BOY RACER RED FERRARI 
THE DIFFICULTY IS WHERE WE LIVE IN SOUTH LONDON 
THEY'VE BUILT SOME COLOSSAL ROAD BUMPS SOME AS BIG AS THAT 
TRY FULHAM IT'S LIKE BECHER'S BROOK 
WHOA WE'RE COMING UP TO THE CANAL TURN LEAN BACK 
YOU'D GET ON TOP OF ONE AND THE LITTLE WHEELS WERE GOING ROUND 
I WAS DISCUSSING WITH THE AUDIENCE BEFORE YOU CAME OUT HERE 
WHETHER YOU'RE PATSY OR PURDEY 
WHERE ARE YOU PATSY PATSY PURDEY 
WHAT YOU WON'T REALISE 
WE HAVE A PHOTO LOOK IN THE NEW AVENGERS AS PURDEY THAT'S RIGHT 
QUITE A LOOK 
IT WAS QUITE SOMETHING LOOK AT THAT 
OUR PRODUCER SENT OFF FOR THIS PHOTO WHEN YOU WERE IN THE NEW AVENGERS 
DID HE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE GOT 
A PICTURE OF GARETH HUNT 
YOU FIND ME IN UNFAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS 
THIS IS A RACE TRACK 
THIS IS MY BAG OF GO FASTER CLOTHING 
AND I'M HERE FOR MY DATE WITH SIR JACKIE 
AND HERE HE IS 
MAKING A TYPICALLY UNDERSTATED RACING DRIVER'S ENTRANCE 
JACKIE STEWART IS A LEGEND ONE OF THAT ELITE BAND OF DRIVERS 
WHO'VE WON THE F. ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP THREE TIMES 
AND I'M GUESSING HERE 
I THINK HE'S ALSO QUITE PROUD OF BEING SCOTTISH 
IMMEDIATELY I LET THE MCLEGEND KNOW WHAT HE WAS IN FOR 
YOU KNOW THEY CALL ME CAPTAIN SLOW DO THEY YEAH 
WELL I'VE SEEN THE BIGGER GUY DRIVE VERY AGGRESSIVELY 
M. M. M. AND NOT VERY WELL I THOUGHT 
SO DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT 
NEVER HAVING DRIVEN WITH YOU BEFORE IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY 
I'D BE SURPRISED IF YOU DIDN'T TURN OUT TO BE BETTER THAN THE OTHER TWO 
I LIKE THAT 
FOR THIS COACHING SESSION 
JACKIE HAD INSISTED ON A REAR WHEEL DRIVE CAR 
SO WE CHOSE THE NEW TVR TUSCAN TWO CONVERTIBLE 
BECAUSE ACTUALLY IT'S A CAR WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN 
FIRSTLY BECAUSE TVR CLAIMS IT'S THEIR BEST BUILT BEST DRIVING CAR TO DATE 
AND SECONDLY WITH ALL THEIR PRESENT BUSINESS PROBLEMS 
IT COULD WELL BE THE COMPANY'S SWAN SONG 
BEFORE SCHOOL BEGAN JACKIE TOOK THE TVR OUT TO SET HIS OWN LAP TIME 
I'M SCARED ALREADY 
JACKIE STEWART IS SIXTY SIX A PENSIONER 
EXCEPT NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE TOLD HIM THAT 
THAT WARMED THE TYRES UP 
OVER THE TOP AND LIGHTLY BRAKE 
GENTLY GET BACK ON THE POWER 
SO FAR OFF THE POWER DOWN INTO SECOND 
LET IT ROLL IN 
YOU CAN'T SEE HALF OF THIS TRACK AS YOU'RE GOING ALONG IT 
NO I KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE CHARMING THINGS ABOUT IT 
RIGHT 
SIR JACKIE STEWART YOU DID IT IN 
ONE MINUTE FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE 
NOW IT WAS MY TURN 
THE MAIN THING TO DO IS TAKE YOUR TIME TO BEGIN WITH 
I MIGHT STILL BE TAKING MY TIME AT THE END OF THE DAY 
LET'S WAIT AND SEE 
FOR MY FIRST FEW LAPS JACKIE LIKE SUPERNANNY SAID NOTHING AND JUST OBSERVED 
MEANWHILE HIS RACE ENGINEER 
MONITORED MY TIMES USING THE IN CAR TELEMETRY 
TWO MINUTES TWENTY SIX SECONDS 
SOD IT 
COME ON 
NO MATTER WHAT I DID I COULDN'T IMPROVE IT 
YOU'RE GONNA GO SHORT OF ROOM HERE 
IT SEEMED I'D HIT MY TALENT WALL 
JUST AS JEREMY DID AT LAGUNA SECA 
JACKIE'S TARGET OF KNOCKING MY TIME DOWN BY TWENTY SECONDS 
LOOKED IMPOSSIBLE 
NEVERTHELESS HE SET TO WORK 
I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE TRYING TO THINK TOO MUCH 
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE DOING RATHER THAN WHAT'S COMING UP 
YEAH THE EXIT OF THE CORNER IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ENTRY OF THE CORNER 
WITH REGARDS TO SMOOTHNESS 
ONE OF THE BIG KEYS IS YOU NEVER PRESS THE GAS PEDAL 
UNTIL YOU KNOW YOU NEVER HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF 
RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS LOTS OF PEOPLE STAMP ON THE GAS PEDAL 
THINKING THEY'LL GO FASTER THEN THEY TAKE IT OFF PUT IT ON TAKE IT OFF THEN FINALLY GET IT ON AGAIN 
YOU DON'T WANNA DO THAT 
THAT WAS A NICE SOOTHING CHAT 
ON THE TRACK THOUGH THE MAN DOES LIKE TO MAKE HIS POINT 
IN IN IN IN 
IN IN IN 
BRAKE BRAKE BRAKE 
BRAKE BRAKE 
MORE POWER MORE POWER MORE POWER 
FULL POWER FULL POWER FULL POWER 
THIS IS PROBABLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IN HELL 
A TVR A RACE TRACK AND A PEDANTIC SCOTSMAN 
BUT THANKS TO A MIX OF BOSSINESS AND WISDOM 
DOWN A GEAR EARLY 
GET ALL THE WORK DONE SO YOU CAN CONCENTRATE ON FINDING SPEED ON THE CORNER 
THE LAP TIME STARTED TO TUMBLE 
TWO MINUTES TWENTY THREE SECONDS 
POWER OFF BRAKE DOWN A GEAR 
KEEP YOUR HEAD TOGETHER 
TOO BUSY YOU FEEL THE CAR RESPONDING BADLY TURN IT IN 
TURN IT IN FEED IT OUT POWER ON FULL TWO MINUTES FIFTEEN 
BY MID AFTERNOON THE TARTAN TASKMASTER HAD KNOCKED ELEVEN SECONDS OFF MY ORIGINAL TIME 
AND ALLOWED ME A TEA BREAK 
THE THING I REALLY LIKE ABOUT YOUR ERA THE SEVENTIES 
YOU JUST PUSHED THE BOUNDARIES A BIT FURTHER 
YOU GOT TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE ENVELOPE 
MORE THAN PEOPLE DO THESE DAYS I THINK 
IT WAS MORE OBVIOUS COS WE HAD LESS DOWN FORCE 
THAT'S LESS AERODYNAMIC FEWER WINGS THE CAR SLID MORE 
I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING MORE IN TERMS OF THE HAIRSTYLES 
IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT YOU'VE GOT NOW ACTUALLY 
IS IT A CASE OF IF YOU LOOK LIKE JACKIE STEWART YOU'LL GO LIKE JACKIE STEWART 
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THAT NOW AREN'T YOU WITH THE HAIR I'M HALFWAY THERE 
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER GO SEE WHAT HAPPENS O. K. 
STAY WITH IT FULL POWER 
YOU FEEL THE CAR DOING THAT I DON'T WANNA FEEL THAT 
UPSADAISY 
DON'T PUT THE POWER ON TILL YOU KNOW YOU NEVER HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF GOOD 
TWO HUNDRED TEN TWO HUNDRED TEN YEP 
JACKIE HAD NOW SLASHED MY TIME BY A MASSIVE SIXTEEN SECONDS 
BUT ANY EXTRA IMPROVEMENT WAS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER 
YOU'VE GOTTA CONCENTRATE YOU'RE NOT USING THE SAME BOARD AS BEFORE 
GET YOUR HEAD TOGETHER 
SEE YOU MISSED THAT APEX PROBABLY BY SIX FEET 
WHOA 
POWER ON ON POWER ON POWER 
TIME WAS RUNNING OUT AND WE STILL HAD TO FIND ANOTHER FOUR SECONDS 
SO HE PULLED ME IN FOR A FINAL PEP TALK 
YOU'RE QUITE BUSY HERE 
FIRST WE COMPARED HIS AND MY TELEMETRY 
AT THE TOP WE'VE GOT YOUR LAP IS IN RED AND JACKIE'S IS IN BLUE 
AND THE DIFFERENCES WERE ALARMING 
YOUR ACCELERATION HERE YOU SEE HOW UNTIDY IT IS 
WELL IT'S NOT PERFECT 
THIS IS SOMETHING HE DOES WHEN HE COACHES CURRENT FORMULA ONE DRIVERS' 
BUT IF YOU CAN SHOW THEM HOW TO DO IT 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CARRY ON BEING A FORMULA ONE DRIVER 
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE DOING THAT ANY MORE 
FINALLY HE WENT INTO YODA MODE IF YOU'RE GOING INTO A CORNER AND I DO THAT TO YOU 
LOOK YOU'RE FALLING OVER 
IF I DO THAT TO YOU YOU LEAN INTO ME YEAH 
SO YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN 
THE CAR REACTS TO YOU IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY 
IT'S LIKE IF YOU WALK UP BEHIND A VICIOUS DOG 
IF YOU TALK TO THE DOG ON THE WAY UP 
IT WON'T BE CAUGHT BY SURPRISE AND IT WON'T DO SOMETHING UNPREDICTABLE 
OBVIOUS REALLY 
JACKIE HAD JUST OVER AN HOUR TO SHAVE OFF THOSE LAST FOUR SECONDS 
AND GET ME DOWN TO TWO MINUTES SIX 
GO FOR IT YES YES THAT'S GOOD MORE POWER MORE POWER 
FULL POWER STEER THE ANGLE OFF 
STEER LEFT GOOD BETTER THIS TIME GENTLY OFF THE POWER 
ON POWER GOOD 
YES THAT'S GOOD TWO HUNDRED NINE 
I'D ABSORBED ALL THE MASTER'S ADVICE 
I JUST NEEDED TO HAVE FAITH IN THE SPEEDS HE SAID THE CAR COULD DO 
OVER THERE POWER ON 
NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH ONE MORE LAP FULL POWER 
YES YES GOOD VERY GOOD 
TURN IT IN TURN IT IN 
POWER ON ANGLE OFF STEERING ANGLE GOOD 
GOOD LAP SO FAR KEEP GOING IN MORE KICK IT OUT 
FULL POWER FULL 
YOU'VE JUST DONE TWO MINUTES SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR 
HANG ON LET ME JUST 
YOU'VE DONE IT HAVE I YEP 
YOU'VE DONE SIXTY SEVEN 
YES YES I KNEW IT 
MY LIFE IS COMPLETE 
EVERY SINGLE WEEK EVERY WEEK SINCE THIS NEW TYPE OF TOP GEAR STARTED 
EVERY WEEK I SAY HAVE WE GOT ELLEN MACARTHUR NO YOU'RE ALWAYS ON A BOAT 
IT'S A PROBLEM EVEN THIS WEEK WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN 
I JUST GOT BACK FROM BRAZIL 
I DID A RACE FROM FRANCE WHICH FINISHED A WEEK AGO 
YOU'RE NOW THE FASTEST PERSON EVER TO SAIL ROUND THE WORLD AND 
OBVIOUSLY WE'VE ALL SEEN IT AND READ THE BOOKS 
WELL I'VE READ THEM 
THE THING IS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE SOUTHERN OCEANS 
HOW BIG ARE THEY 
UM THEY'RE ENDLESS I THINK WE CAN SAY 
BECAUSE THEY GO ROUND THE EARTH THE WIND WIND WEATHER WAVES EVERYTHING 
IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE THERE'S LAND MASS 
THE STORMS ARE STOPPED BY THE LAND MASS 
BUT IN THE SOUTHERN OCEANS THEY ROLL ROUND AND ROUND THE WAVES JUST GET BIGGER 
SO HOW BIG 
UM TWICE THE HEIGHT OF THIS STUDIO I RECKON 
WELL THAT'S SIXTY F. T. SIXTY F. T. YEAH 
I'D SAY SIXTY F. T. AND THEY'RE VERY LONG SO IT'S LIKE 
LIKE GOING DOWN MOUNTAINS BUT QUITE ROLLING MOUNTAINS 
AND SUDDENLY YOU GET A STEEP ONE WHICH YOU WATCH OUT FOR 
YOU JUST JUST GO DOWN NOSE DIVE STRAIGHT IN 
THE SEA IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING 
THERE'S NO SENSE OF RHYTHM THERE'S NO GETTING USED TO IT 
ANY MINUTE YOU COULD HAVE A REALLY HUGE WAVE 
THERE ARE DEFINITELY FREAK WAVES AND YOU HEAR AND FEEL THEM HIT THE BOAT 
BUT ALSO WITH A MULTI HULL IT'S HARDER 
B. AND AMP Q. THE BOAT I TOOK ROUND THE WORLD HAS THREE HULLS 
SO IT'S LIKE HAVING LIKE A CAR HAVING SIX WHEELS 
SOMETHING COULD HIT ANY OF THE WHEELS AND IT WOULD BE AFFECTED AND IT'S THE SAME WITH A BOAT 
YOU CAN'T PREDICT WHAT IT WILL DO 
AND IT'LL GO AND THEN GET HIT AND IT'S A VERY VIOLENT MOTION 
YOU DON'T EVEN GET ANY SLEEP ON THESE MASSIVE VOYAGES 
WELL NOT WHAT I'D CALL A GOOD EIGHT HOURS OBVIOUSLY NOT 
NO QUITE A LONG WAY FROM THAT THE SLEEP IS THE HARDEST THING YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH OUT THERE 
HARDER THAN WAVES THAN FIXING THINGS THAN EVERYTHING 
IT'S THE SLEEP 
SLEEP DEPRIVATION IS USED AS TORTURE 
AND WHEN YOU REALLY CAN'T SLEEP BECAUSE YOUR LIFE'S IN DANGER 
YOU REALLY SUFFER AND YOU TOUGH IT OUT 
HOW LONG WOULD YOU SLEEP FOR IN AN AVERAGE DAY 
UM DEPENDS DOWN THERE ANYWAY IN THE SOUTHERN OCEANS 
THERE WAS THREE DAYS WHERE I DIDN'T SLEEP FOR MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES 
THAT WAS HORRENDOUS IT IS 
TWENTY NINE NOW TWENTY NINE MOST TWENTY NINE YEAR OLDS DON'T LEAVE BED TILL LUNCHTIME 
GOING CLUBBING YEAH 
SO I WANT TO SEE HOW YOU DID ON YOUR LAP HOW WAS IT 
UM THE FIRST COMMENT HAS TO BE THAT I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER 
YOU COULD HAVE DONE BETTER I WAS PLEADING FOR ANOTHER LAP 
AT THE END I SAID PLEASE CAN I HAVE ANOTHER LAP 
THEY SAID NO ELLEN IT WAS VERY DARK TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO FILM SOMEONE AT NIGHT 
WE'D SEE THE LIGHTS GO BY I'D BE HAPPY 
JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW COMPETITIVE ELLEN IS YOU DID ASK 
HAVE I GOT THE SAME AMOUNT OF PETROL AS EVERYONE ELSE YES I DID 
IT'S A SUZUKI LIANA IT'S GOT EIGHTY B. H. P. IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE HOW MUCH PETROL IS IN IT FRANKLY 
ANYWAY SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK AT ELLEN'S LAP YES 
HERE WE GO LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
TYRES SQUEAL 
YOU'VE NOT WASTED TOO MUCH OF YOUR LIFE DRIVING CARS HAVE YOU 
NO I'M AT SEA SIX MONTHS A YEAR 
WHEN I LOOKED AT YOUR CAR HISTORY IT WAS UNSPECTACULAR 
SO WHERE DID YOU LEARN TO DRIVE THAT WAS QUICK 
I DON'T SAY MUCH IN THE CAR I'M AFRAID 
I CAN IMAGINE YOU HAVEN'T WEPT YET 
HAD YOU BEEN DOING THIS STEERING JUST TODAY WITH THE STIG 
HE'S PRETTY GOOD IS THE STIG YOU'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE 
I HAD THREE GOES ON A GO KART TRACK THESE LINES ARE BANG ON 
YOU'VE GOT THAT READY OOH THAT IS HONESTLY THAT IS 
ELLEN THIS IS IMPRESSIVE I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST 
LOOK AT THAT TONGUE'S COME OUT 
DID YOU LIFT OFF THERE OOH 
THE WAY YOU FLATTEN THOSE 
I PROMISE YOU THIS IS QUICK 
OOH HERE WE GO SECOND TO LAST CORNER THAT'S BEAUTIFULLY CUT SMOOTH AS SILK THAT ONE 
HERE'S GAMBON 
OOH THIS IS A BIT WIDE BUT QUICK AND THERE WE ARE ACROSS THE LINE 
SO 
SO WHERE DO YOU RECKON THEN 
DO I HAVE TO PUT IT ON THERE COS I'M SMALL OR DO YOU COS YOU'RE TALL 
TRUST ME I HAVE TO PUT IT ON AFTER A LAP LIKE THAT WE'D STILL BE SITTING HERE WAITING FOR WOGAN 
OH HERE HE COMES 
NO NO YOU'RE SMALL ENOUGH NOT TO BE ABLE TO REACH IT 
I DON'T KNOW I REALLY DON'T ALL I KNOW IS I'D LIKE ANOTHER GO 
SO 
THIS IS A BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN ANYTHING YOU'VE DONE BEFORE WE APPRECIATE THAT 
I WAS NERVOUS OUT THERE YOU WERE THIS MORNING 
OF COURSE YOU WERE THERE'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE WATCHING 
YOU DID IT IN 
ONE MINUTE 
FORTY SIX 
POINT SEVEN 
FIRST PLACE 
BRILLIANT 
THAT'S QUITE EMOTIONAL 
IT IS EMOTIONAL BECAUSE 
THE OTHER THING I MUST SAY THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T LET YOU GO AGAIN 
CAN I DO ANOTHER ONE 
NOT A LOT OF POINT LOVE 
YOU DID A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN ON YOUR FIRST RUN 
ONE POINT FOUR SEVEN EXACTLY ON THE SECOND SO EXACTLY CONSISTENT LAP TIMES 
THAT'S THE KEY 
AND THEN POPPED IN A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX POINT SEVEN 
QUICKER THAN JIMMY CARR FASTEST PERSON EVER 
YOUR LIFE IS NOW COMPLETE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ELLEN MACARTHUR 
TODAY FRANCE IS BLUE 
GERMANY IS SILVER 
AND ITALY IS OF COURSE RED 
EVERY MAJOR MOTOR RACING COUNTRY HAS ITS OWN NATIONAL COLOUR 
OURS IS BRITISH RACING GREEN 
AND THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW IT ALL CAME ABOUT 
OUR GREEN CONNECTION STARTS BIZARRELY WITH AN AMERICAN 
CALLED GORDON BENNETT A RICH NEWSPAPER BARON FROM NEW YORK 
WE CAN BE PRETTY SURE 
THAT THE NEWSPAPER HE RAN WASN'T THE SOCIALIST WORKER 
BECAUSE HE ONCE SET FIRE TO A LARGE ROLL OF MONEY 
COMPLAINING IT WOULDN'T FIT IN HIS POCKET 
BUT BENNETT ALSO ORGANISED SOME OF THE WORLD'S FIRST GRAND PRIX 
THESE WERE ROAD RACES WHICH PITTED NATION AGAINST NATION 
AND FOR THE NINETEEN OH THREE EVENT 
EACH COUNTRY WAS TOLD TO CHOOSE A NATIONAL COLOUR 
THE FRENCH PICKED BLUE THE ITALIANS BLACK AND THE BELGIANS YELLOW 
AND THE BRITISH WELL WE WERE DUE TO HOST THE RACE THAT YEAR 
BUT BECAUSE PARLIAMENT HAD SET THE NATIONAL SPEED LIMIT 
AT A GIDDY TWELVE M. P. H. WE SWITCHED THE LOCATION TO IRELAND 
AND THERE AS A MARK OF RESPECT TO OUR IRISH HOSTS 
THE BRITISH CARS WERE PAINTED GREEN 
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS RARE ARCHIVE 
AH UH 
YES SORRY ABOUT THAT 
ANYWAY LOOK HERE'S THE PROOF 
THIS IS A NINETEEN OH THREE NAPIER 
THE VERY CAR THAT RACED FOR BRITAIN IN THAT EVENT 
IT'S A PRICELESS ONE HUNDRED TWO YEAR OLD CAR 
THAT'S CAPABLE OF EIGHTY M. P. H. 
BUT WHAT MATTERS IS THAT THIS IS THE GENESIS OF BRITISH RACING GREEN 
AND THEN FROM THERE THINGS JUMPED AROUND A BIT 
THE ITALIANS NICKED RED FROM AMERICA 
MEANWHILE THE GERMANS SWITCHED TO SILVER 
DITCHING WHITE WHICH WENT TO 
JAPAN MEANWHILE US BRITS 
WELL WE STUCK TO OUR GUNS 
GREEN 
THERE WAS NEVER ONE PARTICULAR SHADE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES BENTLEY BLOWERS 
OF LE MANS FAME FOR EXAMPLE USED A RICH DARK TONE 
THE COLOUR IS KNOWN AS BRUNSWICK GREEN 
AND IT CAN TRACE ITS ROOTS BACK TO EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BRITISH RIFLEMEN 
YOU KNOW SHARPE SEAN BEAN ALL THAT LOT 
AND IN THE BENTLEYS' WAKE CAME ASTONS 
COOPERS LOTUSES 
SUNBEAMS AND JAGS EVERYWHERE YOU LOOKED IT WAS A SEA OF GREEN 
AND THEN IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES IT ALL CAME CRASHING TO A HALT 
THE VILLAIN OF THE PIECE 
WAS LOTUS GENIUS COLIN CHAPMAN 
HIS NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT LOTUS FORTY NINE WON THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
THANKS TO ITS RADICAL NEW TECHNOLOGY 
BUT IT WAS ALSO THE FIRST BRITISH RACE CAR 
EVER TO CARRY SPONSORSHIP 
SOON AFTER THE MONEY FLOODGATES OPENED 
AND FROM THAT POINT ON 
BRITISH RACING GREEN WOULD TAKE A BACK SEAT 
BUT IF THIS STORY HAS MADE YOU ALL NOSTALGIC 
AND IN THE MOOD FOR A PIECE OF THAT HISTORY I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS 
IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE IT 
BUT THIS IS BRITAIN'S NEWEST SPORTS CAR 
IT'S A VANWALL 
OR SPECIFICALLY A RECREATION OF THE VANWALL F. ONE CAR 
THAT WON THE NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
I'M DRIVING A NINETEEN FIFTIES FORMULA ONE CAR 
WOO 
AS YOU CAN SEE THIS ONE IS COMPLETELY ROAD LEGAL 
AND AS YOU CAN ALSO SEE 
IT REALLY BLENDS IN 
OH SORRY 
BUT EVEN THOUGH IT'S GOT THE NINETEEN FIFTIES HERITAGE 
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES HEADACHES 
SO UNDERNEATH THIS BRYLCREEM AND BILL HALEY EXTERIOR 
IT'S GOT A JAG X. J. S. V. TWELVE 
IT'S GOT JAG SUSPENSION AND IT'S GOT BRAKES 
THAT AREN'T MADE OUT OF OLD NYLONS AND BITS OF MESSERSCHMITT 
I MEAN YEAH IT'S A BIT TWITCHY AROUND THE BACK END 
BUT SIX SPEEDS A V. TWELVE AND THE CAR WEIGHS LESS THAN A TON WHAT DO YOU EXPECT 
IT'S LOUD IT'S BRUTAL IT'S MAD AGH 
THINGS CALM DOWN A BIT THOUGH WHEN YOU TAKE A MOMENT 
TO APPRECIATE THE SHEER LEVEL OF CRAFTSMANSHIP FIBREGLASS 
I DON'T THINK SO THE WHOLE BODY IS HAND ROLLED ALUMINIUM PLATE 
AND IT'S STITCHED TOGETHER SO BEAUTIFULLY 
THAT THE ENTIRE THING LOOKS LIKE ONE PIECE OF METAL 
NOT ALL OF THIS CAR WAS DESIGNED IN MEMORY LANE THOUGH 
THERE ARE SOME FANTASTIC MODERN TOUCHES TOO 
LIKE THESE CUNNING TYRE TREAD MUDGUARDS 
AND THESE FLASH GORDON PROJECTOR HEADLIGHTS 
IT'S ALL HANDMADE BY A LITTLE COMPANY IN PETERBOROUGH 
I SUPPOSE YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE 
WELL IT IS IT STARTS ABOUT FIFTY GRAND WHICH IS TVR SAGARIS MONEY 
BUT THE SAGARIS JUST CAN'T CREATE THIS MUCH SENSATION 
LISTEN TO THAT MASSIVE V. TWELVE 
SUCKING AWAY THROUGH THOSE SIX DOWNDRAUGHT CARBS 
NIMROD BY ELGAR 
WHAT A FANTASTIC WAY TO MARK ONE HUNDRED TWO YEARS OF BRITISH RACING GREEN 
HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE ISLE OF MAN YES 
YOU GO TO THE AIRPORT YOU SAY I LOVE MAN 
AND THEY SAY NOT HERE YOU DON'T IT IS ILLEGAL 
IT WAS ILLEGAL AND YOU COULD BE BIRCHED FOR LOVING MAN THERE 
YES WHICH PEOPLE PAY FOR IN LONDON 
IT'S PECULIAR HAVE YOU SPENT MUCH TIME THERE 
I GO THERE QUITE A LOT ACTUALLY BUT SOME OF THE LAWS THEY HAVE ARE FABULOUS 
HANDGUNS ARE LEGAL THERE AND YOU CAN BE CHARGED WITH FURIOUS DRIVING I'D LOVE TO HAVE THAT ON MY LICENCE 
FURIOUS DRIVING DO YOU HANKER AFTER THAT KIND OF FREEDOM 
WELL I'M A LEFTIE BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU THE OVERMASTERING HATRED I FEEL 
THE WAVES OF DISGUST WHEN THERE IS THAT FROWNING WOMAN ON THE BICYCLE 
WHO LOOKS AT YOU AS IF YOU ARE THE SYMBOL OF CAPITALISM AND MEAT EATING 
YOU ARE THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE THE ENEMY OF THE PLANET 
YOU ARE CAPITALISM WITH A HUGE CIGAR JUST COS YOU MIGHT HAVE BLOWN HER OFF COURSE ON HER BLASTED BICYCLE 
YOU KNOW THAT KIND NONE OF THIS IS RINGING TRUE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE CAR YOU DRIVE TODAY 
OH DEAR IT IS A SAAB 
YOU WILL NEVER HEAR ANYONE SAY LOOK AT THAT MANIAC IN THAT SAAB THAT'S TRUE 
SAABS ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY DRIVEN CARS ON THE ROADS 
I'M FASCINATED TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHEN YOU CLIMB IN A SAAB 
IT'S PECULIAR YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT 
BUT I HAVE TO CONFESS I AM A SPEED MERCHANT AND I CAME SO CLOSE TO LOSING MY LICENCE A YEAR AGO 
I WAS POOTLING ALONG THE M. ELEVEN AT ONE HUNDRED AND HURRUMPH MILES AN HOUR 
BUT THEY TOOK AN AVERAGE WHICH WAS NINE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT 
AN AVERAGE FROM WHEN YOU GOT IN THE CAR YES FROM THE CENTRE OF LONDON 
IT'S A RARE DAY THAT I'M OVERTAKEN I DON'T KNOW WHY 
IT'S PATHETIC IT'S EITHER INFANTILE OR VANITY OR COMPETITIVENESS 
OR AT BEST A LOW BOREDOM THRESHOLD 
YOU WANT TO BE ON EDGE ALL THE TIME SO THAT YOU'RE AWAKE 
YOU ALSO HAVE A LONDON CAB YES 
YES I DO IS THAT FOR USE IN LONDON 
PRACTICAL DECISION I JUST THOUGHT DRIVING AROUND LONDON AS I DID I'D GIVEN UP HAVING A TRAIL BIKE 
YOU ON A MOTORBIKE ALL WOBBLY I WOULD HAVE PAID TO WATCH THAT I HAD A COUSIN 
WHO IS A SURGEON IN NEW YORK IN THE CASUALTY OR TRAUMA DEPARTMENT AS THEY CALL IT 
I WAS IN A PLAY AND WE MET AFTERWARDS IN A RESTAURANT HE SAW ME CHECK IN MY SKID LID 
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU RODE A BIKE I SAID YES 
YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL BIKE RIDERS IN THE TRAUMA DEPARTMENT DONORS 
BAD SIGN I THOUGHT THEN WEIRDLY A WEEK LATER 
A FRIEND OF MINE'S AUNT HAD GONE INTO MOORFIELDS FOR A CATARACT OPERATION 
AND THE DOCTOR CAME IN AND SAID WELL NOW MRS. SMITH I'M SURE IT'S ALL BEEN EXPLAINED 
WE CUT OUT THAT CLOUDY OLD CATARACT 
AND WE SEW IN A NICE NEW FRESH SPARKLY DONOR LENS 
SADLY WE DON'T HAVE ANY DONOR LENSES BUT IT'S RAINING SO IT SHOULDN'T BE LONG 
HE MEANT IT ANYWAY THAT STOPPED ME FROM RIDING A MOTORBIKE EVENTUALLY 
THAT AND BEING BANNED SO WHY A CAB 
I JUST THOUGHT THE BIKE HAD BEEN A GREAT WAY TO GET IN FOR VOICEOVERS AND THINGS IN TOWN QUICKLY 
AND I THOUGHT WITH A CAR I WASN'T NEAR A TUBE STATION AND CABS SEEMED RIDICULOUS 
THEN I THOUGHT MY OWN CAB ON THE OTHER HAND 
NOT THAT I WOULD ADMIT TO USING BUS LANES COS IT'S ILLEGAL IF YOU'RE NOT A LICENSED CABBY BUT THEY DO EXIST 
AND YOU CAN DRIVE IN THEM IF YOU HAVE A CAB WHO'S GOING TO CHECK OTHER CABS LET YOU IN CAB ERADERIE 
AND MOST CARS YOU STICK YOUR HAND OUT AND YOU MOVE OUT INTO TRAFFIC 
THAT'S THE REAL GAIN 
UNLIKE ANY OTHER CAR MAKER LOTUS DOESN'T ASK WHAT THE CUSTOMER MIGHT WANT 
THEY ASK WHAT THE CUSTOMER COULD DO WITHOUT 
AND IT SEEMS WE CAN DO WITHOUT QUITE A LOT 
IN FACT THERE ARE ONLY TWO LUXURIES IN HERE 
THERE'S AN ELECTRIC WINDOW ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE 
AND ANOTHER ONE OVER THERE 
AND THEY'RE OPTIONAL EXTRAS 
YOU REALLY DO GET A SENSE FROM THIS CAR THAT THERE IS NO WASTE AT ALL 
THAT IT IS BASICALLY A ROAD GOING GO KART 
OTHER THAN THIS GHASTLY BADGE HERE THAT LOOKS LIKE 
IT BELONGS ON THE NOTE PAPER OF A MIDDLE EASTERN HOTEL CHAIN 
IT HAS LIGHTS FOR THE DARK A ROOF FOR WHEN IT RAINS 
AND THESE SEMI SLICK TYRES FOR WHEN IT DOESN'T 
LIKE NOW 
NOW IF YOU REMEMBER WE TESTED A NORMAL EXIGE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
IT CAME DOWN HERE AND IT OUTMANOEUVRED A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP 
AND THIS ONE IS BROADLY THE SAME ON THE HANDLING FRONT 
GOD IT'S GOOD 
WHERE IT'S NOT THE SAME IS UNDER THE BONNET 
BECAUSE THEY FITTED THE EIGHTEEN LITRE TOYOTA ENGINE WITH A SUPER CHARGER 
SO NOW IT HAS SOME GUTS TO GO WITH THE G. 
TOP SPEED ONE FORTY EIGHT M. P. H. 
ZERO TO SIXTY FOUR SECONDS 
IT'S THE FASTEST ACCELERATING CAR LOTUS HAS EVER MADE 
IT'S THE FEEL OF THE THING THAT IMPRESSES MOST OF ALL 
I'M IN SIXTH GEAR NOW SIXTY M. P. H. FOOT DOWN AND AND YOU CAN FEEL 
THIS INVISIBLE WAVE OF TORQUE PUSHING YOU ALONG 
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING AND YOU GET CAUGHT IN A CURRENT OH WHERE DID THAT COME FROM 
ONLY YOU DON'T DROWN 
TO SEE HOW MUCH OF A CAR I'VE DEVISED A LITTLE TEST 
THIS IS A FORD MUSTANG 
IT'S MADE BY ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST CAR FIRMS IN DETROIT MICHIGAN 
MOTOR CITY 
IT'S GOT A FORTY SIX LITRE THREE HUNDRED BRAKE HORSEPOWER V. EIGHT AT THE FRONT 
REAR WHEEL DRIVE AT THE BACK AND A STIG IN THE MIDDLE 
TYRES SQUEAL 
AND HE'S LINED UP ALONGSIDE A PLASTIC CAR THAT WAS MADE BY SOME NORFOLK TURNIP FARMERS 
WHICH IS BEING DRIVEN BY A FAT BLOKE WITH A DICKEY HIP 
RIGHT STAND BY FOR A TWO LAP RACE OF OUR SHORT CIRCUIT 
THIS IS SUSHI VERSUS A HAMBURGER 
HA HA 
COME ON STIG KEEP UP 
COME ON 
I ONLY HAVE EIGHTEEN LITRES HE HAS NEARLY THREE TIMES MORE THAN THIS 
AND TWICE AS MANY CYLINDERS 
I CAN BRAKE LATER THAN HIM I CAN TURN HARDER THAN HIM 
I GET UP TO POWER SOONER THAN HIM 
WHERE IS HE 
OH HE'S MILES AWAY 
WOOOOOO 
YES 
NORFOLK ONE DETROIT ZERO 
FRANKLY THE RESULT WASN'T REALLY SURPRISING 
BECAUSE STUFF SOLD BY THE GRAM IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE MORE EXCITING THAN STUFF SOLD BY THE POUND 
SAFFRON FOR EXAMPLE IS MORE EXCITING THAN 
LARD OR CHARCOAL OR MANURE 
AS I SEE IT THERE ARE ONLY THREE DRAWBACKS TO THIS CAR 
IT COSTS THIRTY THREE THOUSAND WHICH IS QUITE A LOT 
IT'S PRETTY NOISY WHEN YOU GO PAST EIGHTY FIVE 
AND UNLESS YOU'RE AS SLIM AND AS AGILE AS IT IS 
GETTING OUT CAN BE QUITE UNDIGNIFIED 
MOSTLY THOUGH IT'S JUST A TRIUMPH OF BRITISH ENGINEERING
