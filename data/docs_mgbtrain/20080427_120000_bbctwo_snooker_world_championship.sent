GOOD AFTERNOON THE GREAT THING 
ABOUT SNOOKER IS THERE AT EACH 
TOURNAMENT THERE IS ONE THING THAT 
WEATHER CHANGES TWELVE BY SIX F. T. OF 
MUSHROOM TABLE THAT IS THE THEORY 
WHAT COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM ONE 
DAY TO THE NEXT ABOUT A CLOTH COVER 
BLOCK OF SLATE QUITE A LOT 
APPARENTLY IT IS AN ISSUE THAT HAD 
LAST YEAR'S WORLD CHAMPION JOHN 
HIGGINS IN A LATHER YESTERDAY 
LOOK AT THAT CUSHION JOHN HIGGINS' 
HE CLEARLY DROPPED OFF A A CHIMPANZEE CAN DO THE MATHS WE 
STARTED LAST SATURDAY AND THEY ARE 
GOING TO HAVE TAKE THESE 
PLEA ON 
THESE CUSHIONS 
WHEN HAVE ANY OTHER 
RANKING EVENT PLAYING STARS 
ON A 
SUNDAY OR 
MONDAY AND 
THE TABLES 
RECOVERED ON THE FRIDAY BEFORE THE 
SEMI FINALS THAT 
IS FOUR RANKING 
EVENTS 
AND THIS 
IS FOR THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP AND THEY COMPLETELY 
SEE THAT THEY MIGHT COME NOT AT 
THEIR BEST 
I KNOW THAT JOHN WAS A 
LITTLE BIT AGGRIEVED TO SAY THE 
LEAST BUT WHERE THE WHITE FINISHES 
THAT 
IS WHERE 
YOU HAVE 
TO PLAY 
NEXT 
SHOT FROM 
YOU HAVE 
TO JUST 
GET ON WITH IT 
OBVIOUSLY DURING HIS UNHAPPY WITH 
THE CONDITIONS 
OF THE 
TABLES A 
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE DECIDED 
SCHEDULE AND OTHER RECOVER INTO THE 
EVENT BUT WE HAVE HAD A FEW THIS 
WEEK ANYWAY IT HAS BEEN SCHEDULED 
AND IT TOOK PLACE LAST NIGHT THE 
CONDITIONS WILL BE BACK TO BRING 
YOU TABLES TODAY HOPEFULLY PERFECT 
FOR PLAYING BROWN NEW TABLES 
BRAND NEW 
IT IS A PROBLEM THAT THE 
TABLES ARE PLAYING TOO QUICKLY THE THE TABLE IS ONLY 
A PROBLEM 
IF YOU 
LET 
IT GET 
TO YOU IT IS FRUSTRATING I 
KNOW WHAT 
JOHN HIGGINS 
IS SAYING 
I'M SURE 
THERE ARE 
TIMES AND 
THE 
FUTURE WHEN 
IT WILL GET TO ME BUT 
YOU HAVE 
TO 
KEEP A 
LEVEL HEAD AND 
JUST 
GET ON 
WITH IT AND TRY TO 
IGNORE THE BOUNCES BUT 
THEY CAN 
MAKE YOU LOOK 
SILLY 
AND THAT 
IS 
OF 
THE MOST 
ANNOYING THINGS 
THAT A 
SNOOKER PLAYER CAN FACE 
THIS MORNING STEVE AND JOIN HAVE 
BEEN CARRYING OUT SCIENTIFIC 
EXPERIMENTS WITH THE TABLES 
KNOCKING BALLS BACK AND FORTH THE 
TABLES WERE RECOVERED LAST NIGHT 
SHOULD IT HAVE BEEN DONE EARLIER I I THINK SO UNIQUE TO RECOVER THEM 
BETWEEN ROUNDS ONE AND TWO THEY WERE 
OUT QUICKLY AND AS I SAID LAST 
NIGHT CUSHIONS HAVE HAVE SOME 
CUSHIONS AVAILABLE YOU SHOULD HAVE 
TO HAVE THEM THERE TO SWAP OVER 
HAVE THEM THERE READY IF THEY NOT GOOD HOW DO WE 
KNOW THIS 
WILL 
NOT GOOD HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE 
WHAT SORT 
OF EXPERIENCE CAN YOU CARRY OUT 
YOU CAN 
BOUNCE A BALL TO 
THAT 
WAS 
BOUNCING O. K. 
BUT 
IT IS 
JUST THE 
ODD ONE THAT GOES WRONG THE HATE 
OF THE CUSHION IS CRITICAL GETTING 
THAT RIGHT OF THE IT IS IMPORTANT 
BUT TALKING ABOUT CLOTH ON THE 
CUSHIONS WHEN IT LOSES ITS SHEEN 
IT HAS LESS OF A TRAPPING EFFECT 
HANN THE CUSHIONING EFFECT SO YOU 
GET FASTER BOUNCING HOURS CLOTH 
GETS OLDER IT IS AMAZING TO THAT AFTER 
SO MANY 
DAYS THE 
CLOTH 
IS WARM OUT BUT AT THIS LEVEL 
WHERE WE HAVE THE TEMPERAMENTAL 
PRIMA DONNAS 
OF THE GAME WE NEED 
PERFECT CONDITIONS BECAUSE WEEKLY 
TO CRITICAL LEVELS WE'RE NOT GOING 
TO 
KNOW IT 
WILL POLICE DOES THIS 
AFTERNOON 
IT SHOULD DO THOUGH AFTERNOON THE LAW OF AVERAGES IT SHOULD DO 
THE CLOTH LOOKS FANTASTIC 
I AM 
SURE THAT JOHN HIGGINS HAS COOLED 
OFF HE WILL PROBABLY WERE BE 
WATCHING THIS AFTERNOON FROM THE 
COMFORT OF HIS OWN HOME HERE IS 
WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT WE WILL GIVE 
YOU THE MATCH BETWEEN RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN AND WERE WILLIAMS ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT THEN INTO THE LIVE 
ACTION 
I WILL BE COMMENTATING ON ACTION LIANG WENBO AGAINST JOE SWAIL HE 
KNOCKED OUT KEN TORPID CAN HE DO 
IT TO ANOTHER IRISHMAN KEN 
DOHERTY 
I HAVE COMMENTED IN OR A DOHERTY MATCH BETWEEN TWO PLAYERS VYING 
FOR A 
IT 
VYING FOR A TOP SIXTEEN PLACE IT SHOULD 
BE A 
TOUGH 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE RULE BOOK THE 
REFEREE WILL BE EXPLAINING HOW HIS 
FELLOW OFFICIALS ONLY DOWN THE LAW 
TWO FIRST CLASS COACHES ARE PULLED 
INTO THE STATION AS SHAUN 
AND JOHN PARROTT A COST MORE 
COMMUTERS AND OFFICIALS AND JOIN 
IS ON A GUIDED TOUR DUTY IN THE 
COMPANY OF SHANE FROM WESTLIFE IT IT LOOKS BIGGER THAN IT DOES ON T. V. IT 
IS MUCH BIGGER WHEN YOU ARE ONE 
YEAR WESTLEY HAD 
AN ARMY 
OF FANS YEAR BUT SO TOO DOES RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
LAST NIGHT THE MAN CHARGED WITH 
STOPPING HIM WAS ANOTHER DOUBLE 
WORLD CHAMPION MARK WILLIAMS 
BECAUSE HE WAS LEFT HANDED AND 
EXCITING TO WATCH IT WAS JIMMY 
WHITE EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM 
I BEAT JOHN PARROTT IN THE FINAL AT 
NEWPORT I HAVE DONE A CELEBRATED 
ANY OF MY TOURNAMENT VICTORIES L. AM NOT 
A WANT 
TO THROW A 
BIG PARTY 
AND GO OUT AND GET DRUNK 
NEXT YEAR I WILL RETIRE THE WAY I 
AM GOING IN THE RANKINGS IF YOU 
FEEL THAT YOU CAN COMPETE THEN 
HOPEFULLY YOU WILL STAY IN FOR A 
FEW YEARS LEFT 
HIS OPPONENT IS ALSO TRYING TO WIN 
THE TITLE FOR A THIRD TIME RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN FIRST TURNED UP AT THE 
CRUCIBLE AS 
A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD 
IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
AND IT 
TOOK HIM 
NINE YEARS 
TO LAND 
HIS FIRST 
CRUCIBLE CROWN 
BEATING 
JOHN HIGGINS IN THE FINAL IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
GRAEME DOTT LOST OUT IN THE FINAL 
TO THE ROCKET POWERED RONNIE HAS 
MADE IT WAS THE QUARTER FINALS EACH 
EAR THE 
SECOND RED 
MATCH GOT UNDER 
REALISTIC IT IS THE BEST OF TWENTY FIVE 
AGAIN THEY WERE I THAT AT TWO TO TWO AT 
THE MID SESSION INTERVAL RONNIE 
IS AT THE TABLE WITH JOHN VIRGO AND 
DENNIS TAYLOR COMMENTATING AT LEAST FIVE REDS AVAILABLE 
HE MAY HAVE FINISHED A LITTLE 
STRAIGHT ON THIS IT SHOULD BE O. K. 
LOOK AT THE BOUNCE OFF THE CUSHION 
THERE HE DID NOT GET ON THE RED AS 
HE INTENDED BUT WHITE HAS JUST 
FLOWN OFF THE SIDE CUSHION NOW HE HAS A VERY DELICATE CUT BACK 
GOOD RECOVERY 
THAT WAS A GOOD POT 
ON THE BLACK BUT IT IS AWKWARD 
CUEING WHAT COLOUR CAN HE GET ON 
OFF THIS RED 
HE HAS MANAGED TO DROP IT IN AND 
HOLD FOR THE BLACK HE HAS GOT TO 
BE CAREFUL WITH BLACKS LIKE THIS IN IT WENT 
HE GOT THE EASY RED TO THE LEFT 
MIDDLE 
NO PROBLEM HERE OFF THE SIDE 
CUSHION THERE WILL BE COUPLE OF REDS AVAILABLE NO NEED TO GO INTO THEM JUST YET 
HE ONLY HAD TO AVOID LEAVING 
HIMSELF HAMPERED BY ANOTHER RED FOR 
THIS BLACK 
HE PLAYS THAT SHOT SO WELL IF 
THERE IS RED TO THE MIDDLE HE 
WILL TRY 
TO 
GET ON 
IT IF 
NOT HE 
WILL CANNON 
ONTO THE 
THREE REDS 
WHICH WILL OPEN THINGS UP HE HAS 
PLAYED THAT CANNON PERFECTLY 
HE HE JUST STOPPED FOR A SECOND 
THEN HE WALKED ROUND WE CAN ONLY 
ASSUME THAT YOU'RE RIGHT DENNIS 
HE HAS PLAYED IT PERFECTLY NICELY 
ON THIS RED A COUPLE OF SHOTS 
AHEAD NOW AFTER THIS RED AND 
ANOTHER BLACK 
THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IN THIS 
GAME IS TO PLAY SHOT 
WHEN YOU 
HAVE NOT QUITE MAJOR AND MINOR UP 
NOT QUITE TEENAGER MIND UP HE 
LOOKED APPEARED EDGY AT THE START 
OF THE MATCH BUT THIS WAS THE 
START HE WAS AFTER ALWAYS GOOD IF 
YOU CAN WIN THE FRAME WITH ONE 
VISIT 
HE HAS PLAYED THESE ARE VERY WELL 
HE HAS CUED PERFECTLY 
JUST THE BLACK NEEDED TO CLINCH THE 
FRAME THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF A 
VERY HIGH BREAK HERE 
JOE PERRY STILL HOLDS THE HIGHEST 
BREAK AT THE MOMENT WITH A BREAK OF 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO 
THERE IS PLENTY MORE POINTS TO 
OVERTAKE THAT HERE 
HE IS THE NEWEST WENT TO STEPHEN 
HENDRY IN THE CENTURIES DEPARTMENT 
HE HAS MADE JUST OVER FIVE HUNDRED STEPHEN 
HENDRY HAS MADE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED JUST THE 
BLACK 
BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED PERFECT ON THE 
LAST RED FOR THE BLACK 
THIS IS WHAT THEY HAVE COME TO SEE 
THIS CROWD 
AND HE WILL CLEAR THE COLOURS TO 
SET A PRETTY GOOD TARGET JUST EIGHT MINUTES FOR THIS EFFORT 
STUNNING ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN BEATS THE HIGHEST 
BREAK THIS YEAR IN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP HE HAS SET THE TARGET 
OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY HE LEADS THREE TO TWO 
RONNIE'S FIRST CENTURY THIS YEAR 
AND WHAT A WAY TO GET OFF THE MARK 
RONNIE HAS MADE FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY OR HIGHER 
BREAKS HERE HE HAS HAD TO ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE 
AND THAT IS HIS SECOND ONE HUNDRED FORTY WE HAVE 
LIFT OFF FOR THE ROCKET HOW WILL 
WILLIAMS RESPONDED NEXT FRAME HE 
IS AT THE TABLE LEADING TWENTY NINE TO ZERO 
HE HAS LOOKED AT ALL THE OPTIONS 
HE HAS LOOKED INTO THE POT INTO THE 
RIGHT CORNER AND THAT IS HIS CHOICE 
WHERE IS THE WHITE THAT IS O. K. 
THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF VINTAGE 
MARK WILLIAMS FOR YEARS WE HAVE 
SAID HE IS THE BEST SINGLE BALL 
POTTER IN THE GAME BUT THERE ARE A 
FEW MORE AROUND THESE DAYS NEIL 
ROBERTSON IS ONE OF THEM 
HE CAN CLIP THIS ONE INTO THE RIGHT 
CORNER HE IS LOOKING AT THE OTHER 
ONE BUT I THINK THE WANT OF THE 
RIGHT CORNER IS A BETTER CHOICE 
I THINK THE ONE TO THE RIGHT 
CORNER 
MARK IS DOING PLENTY OF STROLLING 
AROUND THE TABLE HE PLAYED IT WELL 
MAYBE TERRY HAS BEEN TEACHING HIM 
HOW TO WALK AROUND THE TABLE HE 
USED TO DO IT HAVE A LITTLE SKIP 
AROUND THE TABLE NOW AND AGAIN 
ALWAYS TRICKY THAT TYPE OF SHOT 
THE MIDDLE POCKETS ARE SO TIGHT 
ALSO YOU TOUCH A KNUCKLE AND THAT 
IS WHAT HAPPENS NOW THIS MUST BE 
VERY TIGHT IT IS A BIT OF A 
STRETCH OR SO THERE IS NOT A LOT 
OF ROOM FOR THIS HE IS COMING 
AROUND THE OTHER SIDE TO HAVE A 
LOOK AT IT IN FACT HE IS EVEN 
LOOKING AT THE OTHER RED HE IS 
LOOKING AT THE RED NEAREST THE LEFT 
CORNER POCKET L. THINK HE CAN JUST 
GET THROUGH TO IT IF HE CAN HE 
CAN STAND IN AND BE ON THE BLACK 
YES WELL SPOTTED 
IF HE PLAYS A LOVELY CAN ON HERE 
HE WILL OPEN EVERYTHING UP IF HE 
COULD JUST CANNON THAT THOSE TWO 
REDS IT WOULD DEVELOP THE WHOLE OF 
THE TABLE HERE 
HE PLAYED IT TO PERFECTION NOW 
THIS WOULD BE A BODY BLOW TO THE 
WELSHMAN BECAUSE MARK WAS LOOKING 
VERY GOOD THERE UNTIL THAT DELICATE 
LITTLE ONE INTO THE MIDDLE BUT HE 
HAS STILL GOT TO KNOCK THEM IN 
COULDN'T BE PLACED BETTER EVEN AT 
THE ONE UP TO THE LEFT OF THE 
YELLOW IS IDEALLY PLACED EVEN 
THE ONE 
HE MUST BE THE FAVOURITES NOW FOR 
THE FRAME THE FAVOURITE THE 
ROAD TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE TABLE 
IS IN AN EASY POTTABLE POSITION 
RATHER THAN PERFECTLY PLACED 
HE WANTS TO GET AS CLOSE THAT RED 
AS POSSIBLE AND JUST OFF THE 
STRAIGHT OR NEAR THE WHITE WOULD BE 
O. K. WELL IT HAS FINISHED A LITTLE 
BIT STRAIGHT BUT I STILL THINK HE 
CAN SCREW BACK HERE AND GET THE 
WHITE AWAY FROM THE CUSHION IT 
WILL BE BACK FOR BLUE OR PINK HERE 
YES I THINK HE PERFECTLY 
PLAYED FOR THE PINK BECAUSE HE 
COULD GET HIS HAND ON THE TABLE 
I CANNOT SEE AN OBSTACLE NOW AND 
HE IS NOW SIX POINTS IN FRONT 
QUITE AN IMPORTANT FRAME ALTHOUGH 
IT IS THE BEST OF TWENTY FIVE MARK WILLIAMS 
HAD THE CHANCE TO DRAW LEVEL HE HE HAD TWO CHANCES HE WAS UNLUCKY THE 
FIRST TIME AND THEN HE PRODUCED A 
GOOD POT TO GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE 
MISSED A TRICKY RED IN THE MIDDLE 
AND AT THIS LEVEL JUST SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT SENDS YOU BACK TO A CHAIR 
AND THAT HIS WAY YOU SIT UNTIL THE 
FRAME IS OVER AND IT IS OVER NOW 
THAT IS WHERE YOU SIT THE BROWN 
WAS ALL WAS THAT THAT WAS NEEDED 
BRILLIANTLY PLAYED BY RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN JUST 
NEEDED ONE CHANCE A MARVELLOUS 
CLEARANCE AT EIGHTY ONE HE NOW HAS A TWO 
FRAME LEAD 
SURPRISINGLY THIS IS THE ONLY 
ONLY THE SECOND TIME BUT THE TWO 
GREAT CHAMPIONS HAVE FACED EACH 
OTHER AT THE CRUCIBLE RONNIE WON 
THEIR PREVIOUS ENCOUNTER AND THERE 
IS DAYLIGHT BETWEEN THE PLAYERS 
AGAIN NOW AS WE HEAD INTO FRAMES AS 
AN FRAME SEVEN 
A CARELESS ONE THIS AS I HAVE 
SAID MANY TIMES HE CANNOT AFFORD 
TO HIT THE BALL COLONS ON THE BALL 
CLIMB AT THIS LEVEL PAUL COLOURS 
BUT HE HAS MISSED THE PINK THOUGH 
SOMEONE COUGHED IN THE AUDIENCE AND 
THEY JUST UPSET MARKED 
CONCENTRATION THERE UPSET MARKS 
CONCENTRATION 
THERE IS THE AUDITORIUM AND EVEN 
ON THE BACK ROW THEY ARE PRETTY 
CLOSE TO THE ACTION A COUNTRY MILE 
AWAY FROM THAT SO IT IS AMAZING 
HE HAS MADE A BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY AND 
THEN AND EIGHTY ONE CLEARANCE BUT HE DIDN'T 
GO THROUGH HE DID NOT CUE THAT 
VERY WELL THAT WILL ANNOY HIM 
NOW IF HE CAN GET ON THE ROAD TO 
THE RIGHT OF THE BLACK AND I THINK 
YOU CAN DO IT IN SUCH A WAY HE 
COULD POP THAT AND FLICK THE OTHER 
WHITBREAD AWAY FROM THE BLACK HE 
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THE GHETTO 
FOR THEIR OF THE PINK GET OVER 
THERE FOR THE PINK IT WAS NOT HARD 
ENOUGH WAS IT THAT IS NOT A VERY 
GOOD SHOT FROM MARK WILLIAMS HE 
LEFT IT A LONG WAY SHORT HE IS NOT 
JUST HE IS IN 
FULL CONTROL OF THE BALL FOR SOME 
REASON 
WHERE IS THIS RED GOING HE HAS 
LEFT IT THAT WAS POOR SHOT THAT FROM RONNIE 
PRETTY GOOD I SUPPOSE WE FORGET 
THAT MARK WILLIAMS HAS NOT BEEN IN 
THIS SORT OF SITUATION FOR A WHILE 
HE HAS BEEN LOSING HIS EARLY ON IN 
TOURNAMENTS HE IS AT PROVISIONAL 
THAN THE TWENTY SIX BUT WAS DOWN AT FORTY TWO AT 
SOME STAGE IT TAKES A BIT OF 
GETTING USED TO AGAIN DOESN'T IT 
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF THAT RED NEXT 
TO THE BLACK GOES IT LOOKS PRETTY 
TIGHT HE HAS OTHER OPTIONS HERE 
THE ONE TO THE LEFT OF THE BUNCH 
MAYBE IT GOES NOW HE DOESN'T LIKE IT THE OTHER ONE GOES 
IF HE IS DEAD STRAIGHT ON THE PINK 
HE CANNOT GET INTO THE REDS HE 
WILL HAVE TO PLAY FOR THE ONE THAT 
IS NEXT TO THE BLACK AND EVEN THAT 
HE WILL HAVE TO FORCE IN 
FORTY EIGHT N. T. S. THE LEAD STILL A POSSIBLE SEVENTY FIVE LEFT ON THE TABLE 
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING TO 
PLAY FOR HE WILL HAVE TO PLAY THE 
CANNON DON'T SEE A RED THAT IS 
POSSIBLE WITHOUT DISTURBING 
SOMETHING 
AND IT IS TRICKY BECAUSE SOMETHING THE PINK IS AWAY FROM THE REDS HE 
NEEDS A FULL BALL CONTACT ON THE 
PINK OTHERWISE IT WILL SLIP PAST 
THEM IS THERE ONE AVAILABLE INTO 
THE MIDDLE POCKET 
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY CAKE I 
THINK MARK JUST DIDN'T CHEW THAT 
ONE OF VERY WELL IT WAS A BIT 
TIGHT I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY CAKE 
HE IS NOT HAVING MUCH LUCK WITH THE 
LONG POTS AND THERE YOU SEE HE IS 
DOWN TO NINE PER CENT ONE IN ELEVEN HAS BEEN 
SUCCESSFUL WITH RONNIE IF HE HAS 
HAD THE WEEK AS THIS EVENING IT IS 
HIS LONG POTTING OH MARK DEAR ME 
I DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO MISS THE 
POT 
THAT'S QUITE AMAZING LOOK AT THE 
REDS HOW THEY FINISHED THINK 
RONNIE WAS ALMOST READY TO CONCEDE 
THE FRAME 
HE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT RONNIE DOES 
MAKE SOME SORT OF SLIP UP HERE 
IT IS THE YELLOW THAT IS OFF ITS 
SPOT HE HAS TO GET RIGHT UP THE 
TABLE ON THAT AND NORMALLY YOU 
WOULD PLAY FOR THE BLUE WITH THE 
YELLOW OF ITS SPOT IN SUCH A WAY 
THE BLUE OR A BALL COLOUR WOULD DO BAULK COLOUR 
AND THIS ONE WILL HURT MARK 
WILLIAMS MORE THAN THE LAST 
NO EXCUSE FOR MISSING THE RED HE 
DID 
THIS IS THE KEY SHOT TO THE FRAME 
HE IS GOING CLOSE TO THE BLUE HE 
NEEDS LUCKY CASE HERE KISS 
HE HAS DONE IT AGAIN MARK WILLIAMS 
SHOULD HAVE WON THE FRAME BUT 
RONNIE HAS CLEARED WITH A BREAK OF 
FIFTY NINE HE NOW GOES FIVE TO TWO IN FRONT 
THE LAST FRAME OF THE SESSION YOU 
FEEL IF MARK WILLIAMS IS GOING TO 
FEEL HE HAS GOT ANYTHING OUT OF IT 
HE NEEDS TO WIN THIS FRAME HE 
THINKS HE HAS CHANCES THAT HE 
SHOULDN'T BE SIXTY TWO BEHIND AND MAYBE HE 
FEELS HE SHOULDN'T BE FIVE TO TWO BEHIND 
JUST THIS FRAME TO MAKE DIFFERENCE 
HE CANNOT BUY A LONG POT TONIGHT 
BUT HE STILL KEEPS TAKING THEM ON 
A VERY LONG POT THAT HE SEEMS TO 
MISS HE HAD TO FALL HE MUST JUST 
BE PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF 
UNINTENTIONAL SIDE ON THE CUE BALL 
THAT IS ALL I CAN THINK SOMETHING 
HE WILL BE WORKING ON I AM CERTAIN 
HE DIDN'T CATCH THE PINK FOR BALL 
THERE HE SENT IT TOWARDS THE RIGHT 
AND CUSHION THIS WILL DEFINITELY 
HELP THE BLACK BACK ON ITS SPOT 
WE SAID AT THE START OF THE MATCH 
THAT MARK WAS TAKING HIS TIME 
WALKING AROUND THE TABLE WONDERING 
WHETHER IT WAS A TACTIC HE HAS 
CERTAINLY SPEEDED UP HERE 
THIS IS 
MORE HIS NATURAL GAME HERE ISN'T 
IT 
IT IS A NICE PLACE WHEN HE IS GOING 
WELL 
I THINK HE IS A LITTLE BIT WELL ANNOYED AT LOSING THEIR LAST GAME 
IN THE MANNER HE DID WELL PLAYED 
IT NEEDS A GOOD CANNON THIS TIME TO 
DEVELOP A COUPLE OF THEM 
MIGHT BE O. K. THERE IS ONE TO THE 
RIGHT MIDDLE POCKET 
MARK'S HIGHEST BREAK WAS SIXTY FIVE IN 
THREE TWO FRAME TO HE COULD QUITE EASILY HAVE LED FIVE TO THREE 
THAT'S BET RONNIE NOW NEEDS A 
SNOOKER HE HAS TAKEN THESE VERY 
WELL AS FLUENT AS HE HAS BEEN ALL 
EVENING HE HAS PLAYED MORE FLUENT 
PLAYER AND HE HAS HAD BETTER 
CONTROL OF THE CUE BALL LIKELY 
FLUENTLY 
THE NEXT SESSION OF THIS MATCH 
RESUMES TOMORROW EVENING THAT WILL 
BE 
VERY ENJOYABLE IT HAS BEEN VERY ENJOYABLE SESSION WE HAVE 
SEEN SOME HIGH CLASS SAFETY 
TACTICAL SNOOKER RING IT'S 
FLICKERING AND A MARVELLOUS ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
FROM RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
DO YOU KNOW 
WHAT HE DID HE DID AN 
IMPERSONATION OF JOE SWAIL'S CUEING 
ACTION 
THE RED WAS JUST NOT GOING IN BUT THE EIGHTY EIGHT BREAK WAS 
MORE THAN 
ENOUGH 
TO WIN THE FRAME RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
LEADS FIVE TO THREE BUT WHAT A SESSION WE 
HAVE HAD MARK WILLIAMS EVEN HAD 
TIME AT THE END FOR JOE SWAIL 
IMPRESSION WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 
THAT FIRST SESSION BETWEEN THESE 
TWO 
APART FROM A MAGNIFICENT ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO BREAK THERE WERE A COUPLE OF FRAMES 
THAT LUCK WILLIAMS 
SHOULD HAVE 
WON 
AND RONNIE O'SULLIVAN STOLE THEM 
RONNIE WHISTLE 
THAN'S POT 
RATE 
WAS NOT 
VERY GOOD BUT HE WAS 
DELIGHTED 
DISAPPOINTMENT FOR MARK DELIGHTED WILLIAMS COMING OUT TO BEHIND YES YES WHEN YOU'RE FIVE TO TWO DOWN AND 
YOU WIN 
THE LAST 
FRAME 
OF THE SESSION 
WAS 
A MASSIVE 
WANT 
TO WIN 
HE THREW 
TWO FRAMES AWAY THOUGH IT COULD 
HAVE BEEN SIX TO TWO 
SO THAT 
IS NOT SO 
BAD AT FIVE TO THREE MARK WILLIAMS 
SEEMED TO 
MISS A 
COUPLE OF 
CHANCES AND RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN WAS FAIRLY 
RECKLESS IS 
THAT HOW YOU DID IT A RUTHLESS 
A PLAYER WHO'S HAPPY 
WITH THE 
IS GOOD AT CUEING THE COLOURS 
MARK WILLIAMS 
IS NOT 
BACK TO 
BRILLIANT 
BEST BUT 
HE COULD GET 
BACK THERE

SESSION BUT ANOTHER MATCH FINISHED

BELFAST 
BOTH OF 
THESE MATTERS 
GETTING 
UNDER WAY THIS 
AFTERNOON 
AND BOTH AVAILABLE THROUGH THE RED 
BUTTON WE ARE STAYING WITH PEOPLE 
WANT 
DENNIS TAYLOR IS COMMENTATING FOR 
US WITH NEAL FOULDS IT IS HOW TO CALL THIS 
ONE WITH 
YOUNG 
CHINESE PLAYER 
PLAYING THE 
WAY HE DID AGAINST KEN DOHERTY JOE 
IS FLYING THE FLAG AND LUCKILY FOR 
THE NORTH 
OF IRELAND 
BUT 
ALL OF 
IRELAND 
THE ONLY 
IRISH PLAYER 
LEFT 
IN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
PRETTY GOOD BREAK OFF SHOT FROM JOE 
SWAIL 
THERE SHE IS CAN YOU BELIEVE IT 
ONE HUNDRED YEARS YOUR TODAY RITA BOWMAN SHE WAS AND REDUCED TO 
THE CRUDE 
BEFORE THE PLAYERS CAME OUT 
FANTASTIC INTRODUCED TO THE 
CROWD 
IT IS NOT AN EASY GAME TO CALL NO NO BECAUSE YOU WOULD SAY THAT JOE 
SWAIL HAS THE EXPERIENCE TO SEMI 
FINALS HE LOVES THE CRUCIBLE'S 
BUT THE BOOKMAKERS HAVE COME DOWN 
ON THE SIDE OF LIANG WENBO WHO I 
THOUGHT WAS DEVASTATING IN HIS 
MATCH AGAINST KEN DOHERTY HE IS A 
VASTLY IMPROVED PLAYER IT DEPENDS 
HOW QUICKLY HE IS IMPROVING 
WHAT A SHOT THAT WAS TO PULL OUT OF 
THE BACK RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE 
POCKET THERE 
PERFECTLY ON 
THE BLACK 
WHAT A STAR WHAT A START THE 
CROWDS TOOK TO LIANG WENBO 
WHEN HE 
CAME 
OUT ALONG 
WITH THE IF 
HAVE WANDERED OUT INTO THE ARENA BY 
MISTAKE TOO EARLY WITH THE IF 
THES RATED HE REFEREES 
EVERYONE INCLUDING LIANG WENBO 
HAD A GOOD CHUCKLE ABOUT IT WE WE KNOW THAT HE TAKES HIS SHORTS ON 
THAT WAS EVIDENT AGAINST KEN HE 
GOES FOR A LOT OF BALLS BUT THEY 
GO IN 
A LOT OF THE 
THIS IS A TERRIFIC SHOT HE DID IT 
HAVE AN EASY SAFETY SHOT DID NOT 
HAVE 
TERRIFIC SHOT PLAYED TO GET ON THE 
BLACK AS WELL 
BEFORE HE DID PLAY KEN DOHERTY 
JOHN HIGGINS SAID HE WAS UP AT THE 
ACADEMY IN SHEFFIELD PRACTISING 
WITH THIS YOUNG MAN AND IN ONE 
SESSION HE 
BEAT JOHN 
HIGGINS TEN TO FOUR 
AND 
JOHN MANAGE 
TO BEAT 
HIM IN THE 
SECOND SESSION HE CERTAINLY IS A 
TALENT 
I HAVE HAD A FEW PEOPLE SEE HOW 
GOOD HE IS FOR 
ABOUT EIGHTEEN 
MONTHS 
FROM PLAYING HIM IN QUALIFIERS 
HE IS STILL IN POSITION HE TAKES 
ON TOO MANY SHORTS OR HE USED TO 
SHOTS HE DID NOT MEAN TO KISS 
INTO THAT RED SO HIS NEXT SHOT 
WILL BE AWKWARD 
HE LOOKS LIKE HE IS COMING TO TERMS 
WITH HIS GAME 
IF HE CUTS THIS RED 
AND HE HAS GOT TO GET AWAY UP THE 
TABLE HE MAY BE ABLE TO FINISH IN 
THE BAULK COLOURS BUT HE CANNOT 
CANNON THE REDS IT WAS IT WAS 
NOT EASY THAT 
IF HE IS GOING TO PLAY A SAFETY 
SHOT INTO THOSE REDS AND PUSHED ONE 
OVER POCKET 
POSSIBLY HE 
IS JUST 
LOOKING AT THE LOOSE RED 
I THINK THAT WAS A SIGN OF A BIT OF 
EXPERIENCE COMING HIS WAY HE STILL 
NEARLY PUT 
THE RED OVER 
BUT HE IS ALL RIGHT 
WHAT HE DID DO 
WAS PURPOSELY PLAYED 
THE RED ONTO TO BRING IT INTO PLAY 
WATCH HOW HE RARE KNOCKED THAT 
RED ONTO THE BLACK THAT HAS OPENED 
THINGS UP HE NEEDS TO GET OVER 
INTO THE RIGHT CORNER OF THE TABLE 
LIANG CANNOT GET PAST THE PINK TO 
STICK A 
RED AND 
GET BACK DOWN THE 
TABLE 
HE IS LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE IS A 
POSSIBLE POT ON 
I THINK THAT IS WHAT HE IS LOOKING 
AT CAN HE PULL THIS OFF HE CAN 
AND PLAY IT TO PERFECTION HE HAS 
LEFT HIMSELF ON THE BAULK COLOURS 
WHAT A START FOR THIS YOUNG MAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OF LIANG WENBO IN THIS CHAMPIONSHIP IS 
THAT HE 
IS A 
HARD MAN 
LONG PERIODS 
OF TIME HE 
SEEMS TO 
DIG 
IN LONG 
SHORTS ALL 
THE TIME AND 
KEEP 
SCORING HIS 
BREAK BUILDING 
MIGHT NOT BE AS POWERFUL AS REMEMBER 
HE IS 
RANKED SIXTY SIX IN THE 
WORLD BUT HE IS UP TO FIFTY THREE ON THE 
PROVISIONAL RANKINGS 
HE IS 
GOING 
TO BE 
HARD TO 
KEEP 
AWAY FROM 
THE 
TABLE BECAUSE 
HE POTS A LOT OF 
TABLE BECAUSE HE POTS A LOT OF BALLS 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO BALLS SEE HOW THE TABLE IS PLAYED BOTH 
TABLES HAVE BEEN RECOVERED WE WILL 
SEE IF IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO THE 
CUSHIONS AND HOW THEY BRINGS 
BOUNCE THE TABLE FOR OTHERS WERE 
HERE AT FOUR P. M. COMPLETING THE NEW 
COVERING FOOTERS FITTERS IT 
IS A VERY SKILFUL JOB TO RECOVER A 
SNOOKER TABLE 
HAVING THE TABLES RECOVERED MIGHT 
MAKE THE POCKETS SEEM BIGGER FOR A 
DAY OR 
TWO PLAYERS 
COMPLAINING ABOUT THE BOUNCE FROM 
THE CUSHIONS BUT THE 
JAWS OF THE 
POCKETS WERE BOUNCY AS WELL SO 
BALLS CAN RATTLE AND STAY OUT NOW 
IT THEY HAVE BEEN RECOVERED YOU 
WILL SEE BALLS DROPPING IN FOR A 
LITTLE WHILE THAT IS WHAT PLAYERS 
ARE USED TO HE JUST WENT PAST THE 
MAIN PACK OF REDS HE IS CAN HE GET THE CANNON THIS TIME 
IF THIS WORKS IT COULD PAVE THE 
WAY TO GIVING HIM THE OPENING FRAME 
DOESN'T WANT TO HIT THE IS TWO REDS 
AT THE BACK 
HE HAS GOT PLENTY OF CUE POWER 
THIS YOUNG PLAYER YOU COULD SEE 
THE WHITE IT A LOCKED AROUND THE 
BUNCH OF REDS IT IS LIKE A TRICK 
SHOT NOW HE NEEDS TO PULL A GOOD 
POT OUT 
HE HAS OPENED THE REDS DOESN'T 
WANT TO BREAK DOWN NAIL AND GIVE 
JOE SWAIL THE CHANCE TO GET BACK 
INTO THIS FRAME DOESN'T WANT TO 
BREAK DOWN NOW 
THAT WAS TERRIFIC CUEING WATCH HOW 
STEADY HE KEPT ON THE SHOT HE 
DELIVERED ACUTE IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
DELIVERED THE CUE VERY 
IMPRESSIVE 
AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE POTS 
ABOUT EVERYTHING AT DALOL RANGE HE 
IS NOT A TERROR WAY AROUND THE 
TABLE A TEARAWAY HE IS 
CONSIDERED L. THINK IN THIS LONG 
CHAMPIONSHIP IT IS NOT A GREAT 
IDEA TO BE RUSHING AROUND THE TABLE 
HE LOOKS AT EVERY OPTION AND KEEPS 
HIS CONCENTRATION HE LOOKS 
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS 
OF COURSE LIANG WENBO IT IS THE 
ONLY CHINESE PLAYER LEFT IN THIS 
YEAR'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
HE IS FLYING THE FLAG FOR HIS 
COUNTRY A WEST AND COME TO GET ONE HUNDRED 
MILLION PEOPLE TUNING IN TO SEE HOW 
THEIR PLAYERS ARE DOING 
THE TABLE LOOKS TO BE PLAYING 
BEAUTIFULLY IT HAS TO BE SAID 
I AGREE IT LOOKS NICE LIANG IS 
PLAYING BEAUTIFULLY ON IT THIS IS 
AN EXCELLENT START 
IT IS AMAZING THESE DAYS HOW MANY 
GOOD YOUNG LEFT HANDED PLAYERS ARE 
COMING THROUGH MARK ALLEN 
FANTASTIC PLAYER FROM NORTHERN 
IRELAND OF COURSE NEIL ROBERTSON 
MARK WILLIAMS 
I THINK HE HAS GOT A GREAT 
TEMPERAMENT AS WELL JUST LOOKING 
AT HIS ATTITUDE AND THE WAY HE 
WANDERS AROUND THE TABLE HE LOOKS 
BECAUSE BUT HE LOOKS LOOKS 
FOCUSED 
I HAVE SEEN PLAYERS COME TO THE 
CRUCIBLE AND REALLY STRUGGLE A BIT 
OF JITTERS NERVES BUT HE CAME IN 
AND LOOKED AT HOME STRAIGHT AWAY 
AS IF HE HAS PLAYED HERE ALL HIS 
LIFE THAT IS THE SIGN OF A GOOD 
TEMPERAMENT THIS BOY CAN REALLY POT 
WATCH OUT IT THERE IS A POTTER 
ABOUT THAT WAS SUPERB 
HE MENTIONED LEFT HANDED PLAYERS 
THEY ALWAYS LOOK STYLISH 
CRICKETERS TO BAT LEFT HANDED 
ALWAYS LOOK GREAT IT IS THE SAME 
IN THIS GAME THEY SEEM TO HAVE A 
LOT OF FLAIR I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT 
IS 
HE CAN STUN OVER BEHIND THE LAST 
RED 
IF IT PASSES THE GREEN AND BROWN 
HE COULD CLEAR THE REMAINING BALLS 
HERE L. DON'T THINK IT DOES BUT 
WHAT A START FOR THE YOUNG CHINESE 
PLAYER HE ONLY NEEDED ONE CHANCE 
HE MADE A BREAK OF EIGHTY FOUR 
I COULDN'T HEAR A GULP FROM JOE 
SWAIL BUT THERE IT MIGHT AS WELL 
HAVE BEEN ONE WHAT START HIS HIS OPENING RED WAS SUPERB HE DIDN'T 
MAKE THE MOST OF THE FIRST OF THE 
CHITTY JOE SWAIL HASN'T DONE 
ANYTHING WRONG THE QUESTION AS TO 
WHETHER HE SHOULD STAY OR GO IT 
LOOKS AS IF HE IS HERE TO STAY HE 
MAY NOT BE WELCOME IN IRELAND FOR 
WHILE IF HE CONTINUES TO KNOCK OUT 
THE IRISH PLAYER'S 
HE HAS ONLY HAS 
TO WIN THE FOUR QUALIFYING MATCHES 
TO BE HERE WHAT WOULD YOU SAY OR 
HIS CHIEF STRENGTHS 
HE POT 
EVERYTHING HE LOOKS AT HE'S A 
GREAT BREAK BUILDER HE HAS GOT A 
GREAT TEMPERAMENT HE'S RANKED 
NUMBER SIXTY SIX NOT FOR LONG HE IS ON 
THE UPGRADE HE PLAYS ALL HOURS OF 
THE CLUB PUTS ALL THE WORKING THAT 
IS REQUIRED AND LOOKS HUNGRY FOR 
IT AT THE MINUTE HE'S A VERY VERY 
GOOD PLAYER WAITING TO HAPPEN WITH 
THE MATCHES HE IS PLAYING IN HE'S 
GOING TO BE A BIT OF TROUBLE FOR 
PEOPLE 
HE'S ONLY TWENTY ONE IT IS LIANG PEOPLE WENBO TO BREAK GREAT START FROM LIANG 
HE IS CERTAINLY BETTER THAN SIXTY SIX IN 
THE RANKINGS 
THAT IS WHAT JOE IS LOOKING AT HE 
CAN GET BACK DOWN THE TABLE IF HE 
TAKES THIS POT ON TO THE RIGHT 
CORNER HE WILL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL 
HE DOESN'T CATCH THE RED OVER THE 
LEFT SIDE OF THE TABLE HE DIDN'T 
HAVE WITH THE CANNON WHAT HAS HE 
LEFT 
THIS LOOKS AS IF IT IS DEAD 
STRAIGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BIT 
RISKY THERE FROM JOE BUT HE WANTS 
TO GET IN AND KNOCK FEW BALLS IN 
AND HE'S OFF AGAIN AND THERE IS AT 
LEAST ANOTHER THREE REDS IN GOOD 
POTTABLE POSITIONS 
HE WILL WANT TO CLEAR THE ONE FROM 
THE LEFT CORNER POCKET AS SOON AS 
HE CAN 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THE SAME 
THOUGHTS BUT HE REMINDS ME A BIT 
OF A PLAYER FROM YEARS AGO OF 
PERRY MAN HE POTS LIKE PERRY 
DOESN'T HE 
THAT IS NOT A BAD CALL 
HE WAS ANOTHER DEVASTATING LONG 
POTTER 
HE WASN'T A GREAT BREAK BUILDER 
PARIS BUT A GREAT POTTER PERRY 
HE STILL LIVES JUST OUTSIDE 
JOHANNESBURG 
IT IS NOT A GREAT BUNCH TO GO INTO 
WITH THE CUE POWER HE HAS YOU 
WOULD EXPECT HIM TO FREE A FEW HERE 
IT WAS A GOOD EFFORT BUT IT HASN'T 
QUITE WORKED OUT HE NEEDED A 
LITTLE BIT MORE SIDE ON THAT I THOUGHT YOU ARE 
TO SAY HE 
COULD HAVE DONE WITH PUTTING IT 
BIT HARDER HE ALMOST BROKE THE 
BACK OF THE POCKET THERE 
ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT QUITE A 
DIFFICULT POT JOE IS GOING TO NEED 
SOMETHING A BIT EASIER THAN THAT 
JUST TO GET HIMSELF STARTED THE 
DREADED DOUBLE KISS DIDN'T HELP 
AS I MENTIONED THE TABLE SEEMS TO 
BE PLAYING VERY WELL AT PRESENT 
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE BALANCING OFF 
THE CUSHIONS 
YOU WOULD HOPE WE WOULD BE O. K. NOW 
PLAYING THROUGH THIS ROUND AND THE 
QUARTER FINALS AS WELL BEFORE WE 
COME BACK TO THE ONE TABLE 
I THINK JOE SWAIL WOULD LIKE TO 
HAVE FEEL OF THE TABLE TO FIND 
OUT HOW IT IS PLAYING BUT HE 
DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE HE HAS NOT 
POTTED A BALL YET LIANG CAN TELL 
HIM IT IS PUTTING BEAUTIFULLY 
POTTING BEAUTIFULLY 
I USED TO SAY THAT TO STEVE DAVIS 
SOMETIMES HE WOULD BE THREE AND 
FOUR FRAMES IN FRONT YOU WOULD 
HAVE HARDLY HAD A SHOT YOU WOULD 
HAVE TO ASK HIM HOW WAS THE TABLE 
STEVE HE HAS GOT A CHOICE OF REDS HERE 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE GONE IN 
YESTERDAY WHEN THE CUSHIONS WERE 
BOUND TO BUT ON THE NEW CLOTH 
BASED LIGHT IN FACE LIVE IN 
LOOK AT THE GAP BETWEEN HIS LITTLE 
FINGER AND HIS OTHER FINGERS 
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN STOCK 
STYLE A PRETTY SOLID BRIDGE THAT 
HE HAS GOT GREAT COMPACT STYLE 
NOT A LOT CAN GO WRONG WITH IT HE 
IS VERY COMPACT AND DELIVERS THE 
IN A STRAIGHT LINE COMMAND 
CUE IN A STRAIGHT LINE COMMAND KEEPS HIS HEAD PERFECTLY STILL 
HE'S ALREADY FEW SHOTS AHEAD HE IS 
PLAYING FOR A RED IN THE BUNCH 
THERE THAT IS A PRETTY SOLID STANCE THERE 
HE HAS NOT GONE QUITE FAR ENOUGH 
FOR THE ONE TO THE CORNER SO THIS 
IS NOW THE EASY OPTION 
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE 
CLINCHES THE FRAME IN THIS VISIT 
IF JOE TRIES TO GET A COUPLE OF 
SHOTS IN AT THE END OF THE FRAME 
THERE IS A RED THAT POTS INTO THE 
LEFT CORNER 
HE HAS GONE LITTLE BIT TOO FAR HE WANTS TO SEE THIS RED IN BEFORE 
HE WORRIES TOO MUCH ABOUT A COLOUR 
I THINK HE HAS TO GO THROUGH THE 
PACK 
HE HAS MADE SURE OF THE RED AND AS 
A SHOT AT THE PINK NOT BAD 
WE ARE IN THE SECOND FRAME ALMOST 
AT THE END OF THE SECOND FRAME AND 
STILL ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SUCCESS RATE 
A HIGHLY IMPRESSIVE START THIS 
YOU WONDER HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE HE 
HAS TAKEN FROM THE WING AGAINST THE 
FORMER WORLD CHAMPION KEN DOHERTY 
PLENTY BUT THE LOOKS OF THINGS 
BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS 
HE'S ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
BRIMMING WITH CONFIDENCE HE HAS 
NOT NEEDED A BAULK COLOUR IN THE 
BREAK AT ALL HE JUST KEEPS ON POTTING BALLS 
JOE HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG HE 
WOULD LOVE TO GET A SHOT OR TWO I 
THINK BEFORE THIS FRAME IS OVER 
WITH JUST TO GET FEEL OF THE 
CONDITIONS BUT WILL HE GET ONE 
THE CHANCES ARE THAT HE WENT NOW 
HE WON'T 
LIANG DEFEATED KEN DOHERTY TEN TO FIVE 
COULD HE GET HIS FIRST CENTURY 
HERE 
JUST GONE A LITTLE BIT TO FALL ON 
THE BLUE HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO 
LEAVE A LONGISH YELLOW ABATE TO 
FOUR ON THE BLUE 
YOU WOULD THINK THAT IF HE CAN GET 
THIS IT WOULD BE A GREAT CHANCE OF 
A CENTURY 
THIS WILL BE A GOOD SHOT ON THE 
GREEN NOW 
A TREMENDOUS BREAK OVER NINETY FROM 
LIANG WENBO WHAT A START FROM HIM 
JOE SWAIL HASN'T POTTED A BALL YET 
AS YOU SAID EARLIER NO NEED TO 
PANIC YET BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING 
TO OBSERVE IT IS THE STYLE THAT 
LIANG WENBO HAS PARTICULARLY WHEN 
HE IS CUEING UP 
YES HE HAS GOT A 
DISTINCTIVE BRIDGE PERHAPS A 
COUPLE OF THE MIDDLE FINGERS ARE 
CLOSER TOGETHER WHICH MAKES THIS 
LITTLE FINGER LOOK AS HIS IF HE 
IS A DISJOINTED 
YOU CAN SEE IT FROM A DIFFERENT 
ANGLE HERE 
IT LOOKS UNORTHODOX 
BUT IT IS A VERY STRONG BRIDGE THE 
BRIDGE IS THE LAST POINT OF CONTACT 
WITH THE CUE BEFORE THE BALL SO IT 
HAS TO BE AS STRONG AS POSSIBLE 
LESS MOVEMENT IS BETTER SPIDER SPIDER BRIDGE WE CAN CHRISTEN IT 
I TELL 
YOU WHAT ISN'T T. PLAYING WELL NOT 
A SIGN OF NERVES AT ALL THE LAST 
SIXTEEN OF THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP AND 
WHAT A GREAT START HE'S HITTING 
THE BALL SWEETLY IF HE KEEPS 
PERFORMING LIKE THIS HE'S IN WITH 
A CHANCE OF WINNING THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
IT HAS BEEN A WHILE CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE WE HAVE SEEN JOE SWAIL IN THE 
LATTER STAGES OF THIS CHAMPIONSHIP 
EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE HOW TOPSY TURVY 
HIS CAREER HAS BEEN 
JOE'S PATH IS 
A BIT LIKE HIS CUE ACTION HE HAS 
BEEN UP AND DOWN IN AND OUT OF THE 
TOP SIXTEEN BUT HE HAS GREAT TALENT 
JOE SWAIL A LOT OF PEOPLE FANCIED 
THAT HE WOULD PERHAPS TWO AT NO ON 
LIANG WENBO IN THE SECOND ROUND 
AND THAT IS STILL A POSSIBILITY 
BUT NOT WHEN THE OTHER GUY GETS 
AFTER SUCH A GREAT START HE IS NOW 
ON THE BACK FOR IT HE NEEDS TO GET 
GOING HE ALWAYS DOES HE HASN'T 
HAD ANY TABLE TIME AT THE MOMENT 
NOT WITH A BREAK OFF 
LIKE THAT 
HE HAS LEFT LIANG WENBO WITH A 
CHANCE OF KNOCKING ONE OF THESE 
DALOL REDS INCOME WHICH IS SO GOOD 
AT COOL REDS IN WHICH HE IS SO 
GOOD AT THAT IS WHAT IS FACING LIANG 
THE RED TO THE RIGHT OF THE BLACK 
IS JUST A SLIGHT PROBLEM 
WELL HE HAS ACTUALLY MISSED ONE 
BUT IS IT SAFE OR CAN JOE GET 
THROUGH TO THE ONE NEAR THE BLACK 
I THINK HE CAN THIS IS THE FIRST 
CHANCE THAT 
JOE HAS HAD HE IS OFF AND RUNNING JOE IT IN THE LAST ROUND DEFEATED 
STEPHEN LEE PEN DO FOR TEN TO FOUR 
THAT WAS QUITE A VICTORY 
AND THE PINK IS AVAILABLE I DON'T 
THINK HE CAN HOLD FOR THE BLACK 
BUT IF NOT JUST GO ONE UP THE 
TABLE 
THE BLUE IS OFF ITS SPOT HE HAS HELD FOR 
THE PINK THE BOYS IN THE STUDIO TALKED ABOUT THE TOUCH THAT HE HAS HE HAS A 
LOVELY TOUCH WITH HIS OWN UNIQUE 
CUE ACTION CHEEKY MARK WILLIAMS 
DID AN IMPERSONATION OF HIS CUE 
ACTION IN THE LAST FRAME AGAINST 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HE WON FIFTY OF 
STEPHEN HENDRY HE SAID HE WOULD DO 
A IMPERSONATION OF JOE SWAIL 
STEPHEN HENDRY SAID HE WOULDN'T 
THEY HAVE LOT OF FUN ABOUT THAT IN 
THE PLAYERS' LOUNGE 
IT IS ALWAYS BEEN THE BACK ON WITH 
JOE WHICH IS SO UNUSUAL THE WAY 
THE ELBOW IT IS SO FAR INSIDE IF 
MARK WILLIAMS CAN DO AN 
IMPERSONATION OF THAT CUE ACTION 
AND POT A BALL HE IS EVEN BETTER 
THAN I THOUGHT HE WAS AS A PLAYER 
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE CUE LIKE JOE 
QUITE INCREDIBLE HOW HE GETS THE 
CUE IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
IT IS 
PROBABLY THE WAY HE STARTED PLAYING 
WHEN YOU HE WAS A YOUNG BOY YOU 
SEE SOME YOUNG PLAYERS I DID IT 
MYSELF STAND ON A BOX BUT JOE HAS 
NEVER CHANGED AND IT IS UNIQUE 
AND HE FLICKS THE BALL WHEN HE 
GETS GOING IT IS LOVELY TO WATCH 
HE FLICKS THE REST THERE THAT WILL 
DO NICELY 
JUST WATCH HIS BACKHAND THE WEIGHT 
HIS WRIST WHEN HE DELIVERS THE 
CUE L. LIKE IT 
THAT WAS A BRILLIANT SHOT EXACTLY 
HOW HE GETS ALL THAT WORK ON THE 
BALL VERY INTERESTING TO SEE IT IN 
SLOW MOTION BECAUSE IT IS NOT 
ORTHODOX AT ALL 
PLENTY OF ZIP ON THE BALL WITH THAT 
A HUGE BREAK OF THE REST OF THE 
WRIST IF YOU WERE 
TO COMPARE HIM 
HE IS LIKE THE GREAT IRISH GOLFER 
HE HAS JUST SPOTTED SOMETHING ON 
THE BLACK 
HE JUST LIKES TO SHOW EVERYBODY HIS 
LITTLE MORE ALLEN LITTLE MORE 
COMPANY 
IT MIGHT JUST BE A LITTLE BIT OF A 
STRETCH TO MEET TO GET THAT PINK 
IT IS TIGHT AS TO WHETHER THE PINK 
POTS WELL I THINK IT POTS O. K. BUT 
HE WANTED TO BE STRAIGHTER ON IT 
IT WAS NO GOOD BREAK ACTUALLY BY 
GOOD FIRST CONTRIBUTION JOE IS A 
LITTLE ANNOYED HE DIDN'T MAKE MORE 
OF IT GOOD TRADITION 
MIGHT JUST BE ABLE TO RUN AWAY THIS 
TIME LEAVE THE WHITE TIGHT ON THE 
SPARK CUSHION IT THE STALEMATE IT THERE IS STALEMATE 
HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD A CHANCE 
AT THAT THAT WAS CARELESS FROM JOE 
SWAIL THAT WHITE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
TYPED ON A CUSHION BEHIND THE BLACK 
SPOT THE FORTY FIVE POINTS LEAD HE HAD 
BEFORE THAT RED COULD DISAPPEAR A 
THINK THE REASON JOE WAS ANNOYED HE 
POTTED THE PINK AND DIDN'T DEVELOP 
THE REDS WAS WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN 
KEPT OFF THE TABLE AND YOUR 
OPPONENT WANTS WINS TO FRIENDS 
WITH ONE VISIT YOU REALLY WANT TO 
DO THE SAME TWO FRAMES 
HAS HE GONE TOO FAR NO THAT LOOKS 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT AGAIN 
HE DID LOOK TO SEE IF THERE WERE 
TWO REDS PLANT INTO THE LEFT 
MIDDLE POCKET BUT HE QUITE 
COMFORTABLY GOT OVER IT WELL THE 
PLANT IS ON BUT IT IS MUCH BETTER 
TO PLAY ON SINGLE BALL 
THAT LITTLE CAN AND HAS DEVELOPED 
ALL THE REDS AROUND THE PINK THE 
GENTLEST OF CANNONS HAS OPENED 
EVERYTHING UP 
HE MAY HAVE COME UP A LITTLE BIT 
SHORT FAIR HE MAY HAVE TO CANNON 
INTO THEM AGAIN 
SO JOE SWAIL IS BACK AT THE TABLE 
HE JUST WENT SLIGHTLY OUT OF 
POSITION THERE WHEN HE PLAYED THAT 
CANNON HE DID NOT FINISH NICELY ON 
THE PINK 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE SCOREBOARD IF 
HE GOES UP FOR THE BLUE HERE HE 
MAY HAVE TO GO AFTER THE DIFFICULT 
RED 
AND NOW HE HAS PUT HIMSELF UNDER A 
TERRIFIC AMOUNT OF PRESSURE YOU 
NEVER KNOW WHETHER CUE BALL HIS 
GAME TO FINISH WHEN YOU MOVE THE 
RED WHEN POTTING A RED WHERE THE 
CUE BALL 
VERY WELL PLAYED 
SO THIS RED AND BLUE PINK OR 
BLACK WOULD LEAVE LIANG WENBO 
NEEDING SNOOKER 
I LIKE THE WAY 
HE PLAYED THAT WELL 
THE FRAME IS STILL GOING HERE AND 
IT IS STILL ALL TO PLAY FOR 
BOTH OF THOSE ARE QUITE DIFFICULT 
POTS RELIEF REALLY ESPECIALLY 
WHEN WE KNOW HE WANTS TO PLAY ON A 
HIGH COLOUR TO KEEP THE FRAME SAFE 
I THINK HE MIGHT JUST PLAY A SAFETY 
SHOT 
THIS IS THE KIND OF SHOT HE COULD 
PLAY IS HE TAKING THE DOUBLE ONE IT HAS TURNED OUT O. K. 
WELL NOW ANOTHER CHANCE FOR LIANG 
WENBO YOU COULD SEE JOE'S DISAPPOINTMENT 
HE DOES HAVE A SHOT STILL HE DID WELL TO GET THE WHITE AWAY 
FROM THE POCKET THERE BUT THERE IS 
A SHOT HE HAS ON AND AS BEING A 
LEFT HANDER IF HE CAN GET THE 
WHITE UP ALONG THAT LINE SOMEWHERE 
AND POT THE BLACK IT IS A GREAT 
CHANCE TO PINCH THE FRAME 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD THE CLOSER TO 
THE RED THE EASIER THE POT THE THE ONLY THING ABOUT IT IS THE RED IS 
AN STREAK WHICH IS ALSO IN HIS 
FAVOUR JOE IS HOPING THE FORTY FIVE BREAK 
HE MADE EARLIER WILL SOMEHOW SAVED 
HIM THE FRAME NOT GUARANTEED THERE 
THIS RED IS NOT STRAIGHT AND IT'S 
IN HIS FAVOUR 
OVER SCREWED IT THAT'S A LITTLE 
BIT OF ADRENALIN THERE HE IS GOING 
TO HAVE TO GET THE EXTENSION AT 
THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF GETTING ON 
THE BROWN HE CAN GO OFF TO 
CUSHIONS DROP ON IT OR JUST OFF 
THE ONE CUSHION 
THAT IS ONE WAY THE PLAYERS LIKE TO 
PLAY IT THE OTHER WAY IS TO JUST 
DROP IN THAT IS PRETTY GOOD 
IS HE RIGHT BEHIND THIS OR HAS HE 
GOT TO USE A CUSHION L. WONDER IF 
HE CAN DRAG THIS IN AND HOLD FOR 
THE PINK TO THE LEFT CENTRE IT IS 
NOT BARRED IT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY 
PERFECT NOT BAD 
HE HAS COME UP A BIT SHORT HE WILL 
HAVE TO GO UP THE TABLE AND COME 
BACK DOWN AGAIN FOR THE BLACK 
JOE SWAIL KNOWS LIANG WENBO HAS TO 
PLAY A GOOD SHOT HERE 
THIS LOOKS PRETTY GOOD 
JOE CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED IN THIS FRAME HE THOUGHT 
HE HAD WON IT 
JOE SWAIL HAD AN EARLIER BREAK OF 
FORTY FIVE IT WASN'T ENOUGH THE YOUNG 
CHINESE PLAYER HAS PINCHED THE 
FRAME AND HE NOW LEADS THREE TO ZERO 
GOODNESS LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT 
FRAME FROM JOE SWALES PERSPECTIVE 
SICKENING HE SAT THERE FOR THE 
FIRST COUPLE OF FRIENDS DIDN'T 
HAVE A CHANCE TO GET ONTO THE TABLE 
HE SHOULD HAVE POTTED A RED BALL 
AND IT WAS A HARD ONE 
TO LOSE WHAT WHAT TO MAKE OF THE WAY HE SHOWED SUCH 
COMPOSURE LIANG WENBO 
HE LOOKS 
VERY COMPOSED HE LOOKS LIKE THE 
TYPE OF PLAYER WE SEE PLAYERS 
COME AND GO IN THE GAME YOU SEE 
PLAYERS ON THE UP PLAYERS THAT 
HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME 
EXPECT THE PLAYERS THAT HAVE BEEN 
AROUND FOR A LONG TIME TO HAVE THE 
EVIL EYE OVER THE YOUNG PLAYERS 
BUT IT MAY BE THE CASE THAT HE HAS 
JUMPED UP A COUPLE OF LEVELS 
OVERNIGHT EFFECTIVELY IT WASN'T A 
FLUKE IN BEATING KEN DOHERTY IN THE 
FIRST ROUND ALTHOUGH ANYBODY CAN 
CATCH ANY PLAYER COLD IN THE FIRST 
ROUND HERE ESPECIALLY A FAVOURITE 
IN THE PREVIOUS ROUND THE 
QUALIFYING ROUND HE BEAT IAN 
MCCULLOCH 
IAN MCCULLOCH YEAH IAN MCCULLOCH IAN MCCULLOCH IS A GOOD YARDSTICK FOR 
HOW GOOD LIANG WENBO IS IAN 
MCCULLOCH IS A GREAT PLAYER YOU 
DON'T TURN HIM OVER UNLESS YOU KNOW 
WHAT YOU'RE DOING AS TALKING TO 
IAN PREVIOUS TO THE TOURNAMENT HE 
SAID HE HAD CHANCE AND GOT LIANG 
WENBO AT IT LATER ON BUT HE GOT OFF 
TO A GOOD START HE IS A FLYING 
MACHINE THAT THE GAME IT REMAINS 
TO BE SEEN WHEN IT COMES CLOSER TO 
THE FINISHING LINE WHETHER HE CAN 
CLINCH IT 
BUT FROM JOE'S 
PERSPECTIVE AS YOU SAID HE HAS 
MADE A FLYING START HE HAS GOT A 
LOT OF EXPERIENCE BUT HOW MUCH DOES 
A STEEL LIKE THAT HIT PARTICULARLY 
WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE DRIVING 
SEAT 
HE HAS GOT TO PUT IT OUT OF SEAT HIS MIND HE WILL GO AWAY AND 
COMPOSE HIMSELF HE WILL COLLECT 
HIS THOUGHTS AND GET THIS ONE AND 
GET A THREE TO ONE BEHIND IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO PUT IT BEHIND YOU 
I THINK JOE 
SWAIL LOOKED LIKE HE WAS FUMING 
SITTING AT HIS TEAR IT SITTING IN 
HIS CHAIR LET'S SEE IF HE HAS 
RESTORED HIS AQUA LIBYAN AS WE 
GOING TO THE LAST BEFORE THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL RESTORED HIS 
AIR EQUILIBRIUM 
THEY GREAT STARK THEN FROM THE 
CHINESE PLAYER L. THOUGHT HE WAS 
VERY COMPOSED ON THE COLOURS WE 
GOT DOWN TO THE PINK KNEW IT WAS 
AN AWKWARD SHOT WENT BACK TO HIS 
SEAT WIPED HIS CUE AND WENT BACK 
TO IT HE WAS LIKE AN OLD HAND 
APPRECIATING THE PRESSURE WAS ON 
HIM 
I DIDN'T REALISE LIANG WENBO HAD 
EACH BEATEN STEPHEN MCCULLOCH 
IAN MCCULLOCH TEN TO FIVE HE IS EIGHTY FOUR R. T. 
COMPETITOR IF HE IS PLAYING AND 
BEATING PLAYERS LIKE THAT AND CAME 
HERE AND BEAT KEN DOHERTY TEN TO FIVE I 
THINK JOHN PARROTT WASN'T FAR AWAY 
WHEN HE SAID THIS FELLA HAS GOT A 
CHANCE OF WINNING HERE THIS YEAR 
WOULDN'T THAT BE STORY 
THAT IS ANOTHER GREAT SHOT THIS 
WAS NO WAY AN EASY SHOT IN THE 
MIDDLE POCKET YOU COULD SEE AGAIN 
THERE HOW THEY IT WAS HOW THIN IT WAS 
WELL IT IS HE ON ONE THE RED AT 
THE BOTTOM OF THE PARK WILL POT BUT 
WILL HE BE ABLE TO GET TO IT A HE JUST OVER CUT IT 
HE DID IT EVERY CHANCE AND IT 
ALMOST DROPPED IN THIS IS THE LAST 
FRAME BEFORE THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL JOE SWAIL WILL NOT ONE 
RED ON TO THE OTHER AND FISH NICELY 
ON THE BLACK HE HAS GOT TO TAKE 
FULL ADVANTAGE HERE 
WE KNOW JOE SWAIL HAS BEEN UP AND 
DOWN THE RANKINGS THAT HAS BEEN 
MENTIONED BUT HE DOES IT ON THE 
BIG STAGE HE LOVES IT ON THE BIG 
STAGE 
WE HAVE STILL GOT THE TWO TABLES IN 
THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE IT GOES TO 
THE ONE TABLE WHEN IT GETS TO THE 
SEMI FINALS IT IS AMAZING VERY 
AND LOT OF PLAYERS WHO GO THROUGH 
THEIR WHOLE CAREER AND NEVER GET TO 
PLAY AT THE ONE TABLE SITUATION AT 
THE CRUCIBLE 
IT IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ONE IT IS 
ONE TABLE OBVIOUSLY THERE IS NOT 
A LOT OF ROOM DOWN THERE WHEN YOU 
SEE THE ONE TABLE SET UP YOU 
WONDER HOW THEY GET TWO TABLES IN 
DOWN THERE YOU CAN SEE THAT JOE 
LOOKS LITTLE UNDER PRESSURE IN 
HIS BREAK HE IS CUEING NICELY YOU 
CAN SEE HE IS IN GOOD NICK HE IS 
CHEST AND LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE 
NOT HAVING WON ANY OF THE FIRST 
THREE FRAMES SOMETIMES IT IS HARD 
TO JUST FORGET THE LITTLE MISTAKES 
YOU'VE MADE AND PUT THEM OUT OF 
YOUR HEAD HE HAS GOT TO CAPITALISE 
ON THIS AND GET SOME KIND OF 
FOOTHOLD AND THE MATCH HE IS NOT 
QUITE IN PERFECT POSITION HERE 
HE TOOK THE HE TOOK HIS EYE OF 
THE POT HE IS RELUCTANT TO LEAVE 
THE TABLE BUT YOU HAVE TO DO THAT 
THAT IS A SITTER HE JUST TOOK HIS 
ARM OF THE POT 
IS HE OFF AGAIN 
A SIMILAR PATTERN 
TO THE FREE MEARS PREVIOUS FRAME 
JOE SWAIL HAS LET HIM IN INDIA 
THAT IS PERFECT WE CAN PUT THE 
WHITE ANY WAY HE CHOOSES HERE FROM 
THAT POSITION THERE ARE JUST THE 
TWO REDS THAT ARE NEXT TO THE PINK 
THAT ARE TIED UP 
NOW EVERYTHING IS OPEN NOW THAT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT 
AWKWARD THAT WAS AN UNINTENTIONAL 
CANNON THERE HE WANTED TO SLIP BY 
THAT RED HE IS HAMPERED THERE 
THAT IS WHY HE IS LOOKING AT MAKING 
THIS ONE INTO THE RIGHT CORNER IT 
IS QUITE A THIN ONE HE HAS GONE 
ROUND THE TABLE TO LOOK AT THE 
POTTING ANGLE 
RIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF THE POCKET 
HE IS THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BLUE 
BUT THIS SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM 
FOR HIM 
A LITTLE BIT OF SIDE AS LONG AS HE 
MISSES THE YELLOW HE CAN LEAVE 
THOSE TWO REDS 
HE HAS GONE AT THE OTHER SIDE WITH 
THE SAME RESULT 
I THINK JOE SWAIL WILL BE GLAD TO 
GET THE MID SESSION INTERVAL IS 
HE GOING TO BE FOUR TO ZERO BEHIND OR THREE 
TO ONE 
HE HAS OVERCOME IT HE JUST DROPPED 
IT IN OFF THE ANGLE THAT IS WHY 
THE WHITE HAS GONE ASTRAY 
THOUGHT HE HAD MISSED THIS ONE HOW 
DID THAT ONE DROP IN 
THAT IS ONE OF THE ONES THAT WOULD 
NOT HAVE DROPPED IN UNTIL THEY 
RECOVERED THE CLOTHS 
BECAUSE HE MISJUDGED THE BLACK SO 
MUCH EVEN THOUGH THE POT WENT IN 
THE CUE BALL HAS GONE ASTRAY IT 
SEEMS TO ME THAT HE DOES NOT FANCY 
A POT HERE FOR ONCE HE IS LOOKING 
AT THE SAFETY 
HE POTS A LOT OF THOSE UP INTO THE 
TOP POCKET HE MIGHT HAVE BALLS HE 
KNOCKED INTO THE TOP POCKET WHEN HE 
PLAYED KEN DOHERTY IT SEEMS THAT 
HE IS VERY CONFIDENT ON THOSE 
THAT WILL GO DOWN AS A LONG POT 
PLAY LEAR SPADEA SPADEA 
HE WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED IF 
HE CAN GET THIS FRAME JOE SWAIL 
THE DIFFICULT RED IS THE ONE THAT 
HE IS LEANING OVER HE COULD EVEN 
PLAY FOR THAT BECAUSE HE DOESN'T 
DROP FOR THAT WHO HAS GOT THE ONE 
NEXT TO THE BLUE 
HE HAS FINISHED A LITTLE BIT 
AWKWARD HE STILL HAS THE OTHER ONE 
HE WAS HOPING TO BE STRAIGHT ON 
THIS JUST TO ROLL IT INTO THE 
MIDDLE NOT QUITE A SNOOKER 
THIS RED WILL GO CLOSE TO THE RIGHT 
CORNER POCKET IF HE DOUBLES IT 
ACROSS THE TABLE BUT HE COULD 
CATCH THE GREEN OR BLUE ON THE WAY 
BACK UP 
A LITTLE BIT THIN HE MAY HAVE LEFT 
A CHANCE JOE CAN STILL GET TO THE 
POTTING ANGLE 
JOE WILL BE AWARE THAT HE HAS NOT 
POTTED TOO MANY LONG BALLS IN THIS 
MATCH THAT WAS A BIG ONE HE HAS FINISHED A LITTLE AWKWARD 
THE BLUE IS BETTER TO GET ONTO THE 
YELLOW WITH THE GREEN HE HAS A 
LONG WAY TO TRAVEL WITH THE CUE 
BALL 
CAN HE DROPPED NICELY ON THE 
YELLOW IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD TO ME 
CERTAINLY A DECENT SHOT PROBABLY 
WILL LEAD THE REST FOR THIS NEED 
THE REST 
NOT MUCH OF A MARGIN FOR ERROR ON 
THOSE SHOTS PLAYING TO SCREW BACK 
WHEN IT IS NOT VERY STRAIGHT ON THE 
SHOT STILL GOT WORK TO DO L. 
WONDER IF HE WILL SCREW INTO THE 
BROWN OR PLAY OFF ONE CUSHION A 
IF HE CAN AVOID THE CANNON ON THE 
BROWN HE WOULD JUST DROP IT IN 
BUT IF THAT IS A BIT DIFFICULT HE 
WILL CANNON THE BROWN HE HAS COME UP A LITTLE BIT SHORT 
JOE TAKING A LITTLE BREAK HERE TO 
HAVE A LOOK HE KNOWS HE NEEDS 
BROWN AND BLUE 
LIANG WENBO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
THE MATCH HAS MISSED ONE OR TWO 
IN THIS FRAME JOE WANTED TO AVOID 
THAT MY WORD YOU CAN SEE HOW HE 
FEELS ABOUT IT HE FINDS A SMILE 
FROM SOMEWHERE WHICH IS GRADE BUT 
HE KNOWS THAT IS POTENTIALLY THE 
END OF THE FRAME IF HE CAN MISS 
THE BLACK HE COMES AROUND NICELY 
FOR THE BLUE BUT LOOK AT THE KISS 
THAT HE GOT HE WILL NOT FANCY 
GOING FOR THIS HE HAS GOT TO PLAY 
A GOOD SAFETY HE SAYS TO THE 
REFEREE WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A 
GO AT THIS IT WAS A POOR SHOT TO 
GET ON THE BROWN FROM GREEN WHICH 
HAS CAUSED THIS PROBLEM 
HE ONLY 
NEEDS THE BLUE IF HE HASN'T GOT AN 
EASY SAFETY SHOT HE MIGHT BE 
TEMPTED TO TRY AND POT THIS VERY 
VERY DIFFICULT BLUE THERE IS 
ALWAYS A CHANCE YOU CAN GET IT SAFE 
THAT WAS WORTH THE RISK HE HAS GOT 
A DECENT CUE BALL AND THIS IS A 
TOUGH BLUE THAT LIANG IS FACED WITH 
WHAT A FASCINATING SHOT COMING UP 
LIANG NEEDS BLUE PINK AND BLACK 
WILL HE TAKE THE LONG BLUE ON 
THIS IS WHAT HE'S FACED WITH 
ALMOST DEAD STRAIGHT THIS NEED 
PERFECT CUEING BUT IF IT GOES IN 
IT IS HIS FRAME BUT WHAT A SHOT 
YOU KNOW HE WILL TAKE IT ON 
ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEED JOHN KNOWS 
IT AS WELL JOE KNOWS IT THE 
PROBLEM IS HE HAS GOT HIS HAND ON 
THE BAULK CUSHION AND IT IS MAKING 
THE SHOT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT 
HE DOES LIKE TO GIVE HIMSELF EVERY 
CHANCE THAT IS IN HIS FAVOUR HE'S 
NOT FRIGHTENED TO HAVE A GOOD LOOK 
AT A SHOT WHEREAS THE BLUE GOING 
IT WAS A BIG SHOT THAT IT WAS A 
TOUGH SHOT 
JUST THE BLUE FOR JOE SWAIL TO GET 
TO THE INTERVAL THREE TO ONE BEHIND 
HE'S HAVING A FEW PROBLEMS GETTING 
HIMSELF ON THE TABLE TO PLAY THIS 
HE HAS GOT IT THAT WAS JUST ABOUT 
KNOCKING IN ONE BALL TWO SNOOKERS NEEDED 
THE DIFFERENCE IS TWENTY ONE POINTS LIANG 
IT JUST MAKING THE DECISION HE HAS 
CONCEDED THE FRAME 
JOE SWAIL COULD HARDLY LOOK TOWARDS 
THE END OF THAT FRAME RELIEF FOR 
HIM 
YES AN IMPORTANT CRUMBLED IN HIM A LONG MATCH YOU HAVE TIME TO 
RECOVER BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO LET 
YOUR OPPONENT GET TOO FAR AWAY WE 
SAW STEPHEN MAGUIRE AGAINST NEIL 
ROBERTSON HOW IT CAN BECOME 
EMBARRASSING AN IMPORTANT FRAME TO 
WIN YOU DON'T FEEL SETTLED DOWN 
UNTIL YOU GET YOUR FIRST FRAME ON 
THE BOARD 
HE KNOWS ANY POTENTIAL 
SLIP UP THIS FELLOW LOOKS 
POTENTIAL ABLE TO CLEAR UP HE HE HAS BEEN IN GREAT FORM FROM BALL 
ONE OF THE TOURNAMENT YOU DON'T 
GET IN THE SECOND ROUND BY BEATING 
KEN DOHERTY HE IS A TOP PLAYER 
YOU HAVE TO PLAY GOOD STUFF IT IS 
PROBABLY A SHOCK TO JOE BECAUSE HE 
HAS NOT SEEN HIM PLAY HE KNOWS HE 
CAN PLAY NOW 
WE WILL BE BACK TO 
THIS MATCH LIVE ONCE THEY HAVE 
TAKEN TEA AT THE INTERVAL WE WERE 
REMARKING LAST NIGHT ABOUT THE 
TRAINING STATION FEATURES THAT WE 
HAVE BEEN RUNNING AND OUR TOP 
CLASS COACHES JOHN PARROTT AND 
SHAUN MURPHY HAVE NOT HAD A GREAT 
DEAL OF SUCCESS 
AS YET WHEN THEY 
HAVE BEEN COACHING THESE PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE TICKETS NONE OF THEM HAVE 
POTTED A BALL SUCCESSFULLY YET WE 
ARE JUST WAITING FOR THE FIRST ONE 
SHALL WE SEE THEY ARE MORE 
SUCCESSFUL TODAY THANK YOU 
TICKETS PLEASE 
HOW YOU 
NOT TOO 
BAD ANGLING TO GET THE BALL INTO 
A SECOND POCKET 
SO WHERE TO HIT 
IT A YES WE HAVE GOT A FOOLPROOF 
METHOD THE YOU KNOW WHAT A POT IS 
YOU WERE A PRIVATE PLANT AND THAT 
CORNER POCKET SHAUN IF YOU GO 
DOWN AND YOU WERE LYING ON THE 
PINK FOR BALL I MOVED UP THE WAY 
THAT IS GOOD TO BE THE PERFECT 
POTTING ANGLE SO IN PRINCIPLE 
EVERY BALL ON THE TABLE IT IS SET 
UP IN THE SAME WAY YOU WILL HAVE 
TO HELP US FOR THAT IF YOU GO 
DOWN 
TO POT THIS ONE L. WILL NEED TO LINE UP MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE WHITE AND LINE 
UP FULL BALL ON THE PINK FULL IN 
THE FACE PERFECT AND THAT IS HOW 
YOU GET THE ANGLE EVERY BALL ON 
THE TABLE NO MATTER WHERE IT IS 
THAT IS THE SAME PRINCIPLE ALL THE 
PINK IS IT IS THE CUE BALL MAKING 
CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT BALL SO 
EVERY ANGLE THE TABLE YOU CAN POT 
A BALL AT 
SO LONG AS YOU DON'T 
MIND CARRYING THE PINK AROUND I I HAVEN'T GOT A TICKET BY THE WAY 
IS THAT ALL RIGHT 
DOES THAT COUNT 
IT WAS OVER THE 
HOLE AXE MICHIE CAN TO MISS IT T. T. WANT TO BE A SNOOKER COACH OR NOT 
NO TOO MUCH STICK 
I KNOW YOU WANT 
TO BE A POP STAR HE IS CARVING OUT 
A NEW CAREER IN THE POP BUSINESS 
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH OF IT 
IT WAS AFTER A MEETING WITH SHANE 
FROM WEST LIFE YESTERDAY PLEASURE PLEASURE TO SEE COMING THROUGH THE HALLOWED 
TUNNEL HERE THIS IS THE CROSS 
DOUBLE THEATRE THIS PRETTY SPECIAL 
YOU HAVE WATCHED THE SESSION WOULD 
YOU THINK OF THE ATMOSPHERE 
IT WAS 
WEIRD SITTING IN THE SEATS IT IS 
VERY CLOSE IT HAS BEEN A GREAT 
TIMES SO FAR 
YOU CAN HEAR PEOPLE 
IN THE FRONT ROW BREATHING 
YOU CAN 
HEAR PEOPLE CLAPPING 
IT TAKES A 
BIT OF GETTING USED TO COME BUT THE 
CONCENTRATION 
IT LOOKS BIGGER THAN CONCENTRATION IT IS ON TELLY EVERYONE SAYS IT 
WILL LOOK SMALLER BUT IT LOOKS A 
LOT BIGGER 
IT IS DIFFERENT FROM 
WATCHING ON T. V. DO YOU THINK YOU 
HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM COMING 
TO WATCH 
I THINK TAKING THE SAFETY 
THE MANDATE U. K. YOU LITERALLY COULD 
LOSE A FRAME IF YOU TAKE A TRICKY 
POT ON AT HOME HE WOULD BE BANGING 
THEM IN OR LEAVE THE WHOLE THING 
ON IT IS JUST A DIFFERENT KIND OF 
LEAGUE ALTOGETHER 
LET'S HAVE SAID 
IN THESE CHAIRS AT A SEAT WHAT 
ABOUT SNOOKER WHY YOU'RE A PLAYER 
WHY THE TABLE IN MY HOUSE L. PLAY A 
BIT EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS EVERY 
GET HOME I TRIED EVERY SNOOKER 
NIGHT WITH MY MATES LOTS OF MONEY 
IN THERE 
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER 
LADS 
NICKY IS QUITE HANDY LADS ACTUALLY HE IS BETTER THAN ME HE 
KNOCKS IN FORTY AND FIFTY BREAKS L. 
PLAYED HIM IN HIS HOUSE ONCE HE 
BEAT ME FIVE TO ONE NOW I WILL BEAT HIM FIFTY ONE 
THE TABLE YOU HAVE GOT HIS BE 
FAMOUS AS WELL 
I THINK IT IS THE 
TWO THOUSAND TWO FINAL PAUL HUNTER AGAINST 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IT IS A NICE 
TABLE TO HAVE 
YOU HAVE BEEN SOME 
OF THE BIGGEST AUDITORIUMS IN THE 
WORLD BUT NEVER POTTED A BALL AT 
THE CRUCIBLE L. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
GET TABLE SET UP OVER THERE YOU 
HAVE GOT A CUE BALL WE WANT TO SEE 
A TALENT OKAY COME ON YOU CAN DO 
IT

SINGER DON'T LET THE GREY HAIR 
CONFUSE YOU I CAN GO BLONDE L. CAN SING YOU DO A FAVOUR FOR SOMEONE 
JOHN ASSUMED THAT WHEN EVERYONE WAS

LOVELY FELLOW

A BLAST 
CHOIR PRACTICE FOR YOU 
LATER ON 
THANKS VERY MUCH LET'S LET'S TAKE CHEQUE ON EVENTS IN TABLE TWO 
ANOTHER MATCH JUST GETTING UNDER 
WAY BETWEEN THEM STUART BINGHAM 
AND JOE PERRY HAVE MANAGED TO 
DISPATCH THREE WORLD CHAMPIONS 
BOTH MEN FANCIED THEIR CHANCES OF 
MAKING IT TO THE QUARTERS THIS TIME 
BINGHAM TOOK THE FIRST FRAME 
THE ONLY ONE THAT IS 
DEFINITELY ON HIS THE TWO REDS THAT 
ARE TOGETHER PLAY THOSE THING WITH 
A CHECK SIDE BUT A VERY DANGEROUS 
SHOT 
HE IS PLAYING THAT SHOT HE PLAYED 
THAT WITH ONE INSIDE BUT THE SAME 
SHOT 
HE WILL TAKE THAT HE WAS UNCERTAIN 
TO GET INTO A TRACK BACK CLEAN 
GOOD KISS ON THE GREEN HE NEEDS TO GET MOVING 
WHY EVEN THOUGH JOE IS NOT AT HIS 
BEST AT THE LIMIT HE HAS DEVELOPED 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN THE FRAME 
THERE HE'S ONLY FIVE POINTS BEHIND 
HE JUST NEEDS ONE OF THE TWO 
DIFFICULT ONES 
JUST LOST THE CUE BALL A LITTLE BIT 
HE CAN HOLD IT THOUGH THESE 
CLOTHSS ARE PRETTY GOOD FOR THESE 
SHOTS 
THIS COULD SETTLED JOE PERRY DOWN 
NOW HE HAS BEEN BELOW PAR SO FAR 
LUCKILY FOR BOTH PLAYERS THEY ARE 
A LITTLE BIT OUT OF TOUCH THE FACT 
THAT IS HIS THREE SESSIONS YOU 
HAVE TIME TO GET INTO YOUR RHYTHM 
NEITHER PLAYER YET APPEARS TO HAVE 
GOT USED TO THE NEW CLOTH 
I THINK HE MAY HAVE COVERED THE RED 
THAT IS SECOND OFF THE CUSHION 
THERE 
WELL DOG WELL DONE THAT WAS A 
MORE DIFFICULT POT THAN THE ONE HE 
MISSED OF HIS PREVIOUS VISIT IN 
THE CENTRE 
I THINK IT IS THE FIRST KICK WE 
HAVE HAD SO FAR L. L. DON'T THINK THE 
NEW CLOTH AND CUSHIONS STOPS THE 
KICKS REALLY 
WE WILL FIND OUT ONE 
DAY WE HAVE HAD IT ALL SORTS OF 
PROFESSORS ON THE JOB TRYING TO 
SORT IT OUT 
WE GET LETTERS ABOUT IT ALL THE 
TIME AND THEY ALL LOOKED AT BUT 
WE USED TO PLAY WITH A THICKER 
CLOTH YEARS AGO AND TO BE HONEST 
WE GOT A VERY FEW KICKS AND A 
SLIGHTLY HEAVIER BALL AS WELL VERY 
EASY TO SCREW BACK WITH THESE BALLS 
MAYBE THE THIN CLOTH AND DELIGHT 
BALLS OF ONE OF THE REASONS THE 
LIGHT BALLS 
I THOUGHT FOR A SECOND HE HAD OVER 
RUN IT BUT HE IS O. K. IT IS 
UNMISSABLE REALLY THIS ONE HE 
SHOULDN'T MISS THIS ONE 
STUART BINGHAM WILL BE THE MOST 
DISAPPOINTED OF THE TWO AT ONE TO ONE JOE 
PERRY WILL BE HAPPY TO HAVE WON ONE 
OF THE OPENING FRAMES 
JOE SIZEABLE BREAKS FROM JOE PERRY 
NO SIZEABLE BREAKS 
THE SITUATION OLD REAL LITTLE IS 
TO RIVAL CREW SITUATION IT BE A 
LITTLE 
THE MATCH NOW FEATURES A YOUNG 
CHINESE PLAYER LIANG WENBO HE IS 
A VERY INTERESTING MATCH UP HE 
WROTE A BIOGRAPHY OF THINGS HE 
LIKED I'LL DID NOT LIKE HE SAID 
HIS FAVOURITE FOOTBALL TEAM WAS 
OVER POOL WHICH DID NOT ENDEAR HIM 
TO YOU JOHN PARROTT LIVERPOOL 
HE SAID HIS FAVOURITE ACTOR WAS 
JACKIE CHAN AND HE SAID HIS 
FAVOURITE MUSICIAN WAS BEETHOVEN A 
MAN OF CULTURE BUT HE IS ALSO WON 
INSTINCT THE HERO AT THE CRUCIBLE 
ROB WALKER THE M. C. WAS INTRODUCING 
THE A. N. C.'S LIANG WENBO CAME OUT 
JUST BEHIND THEM THE REFEREES 
THEN ROB WALKER EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT 
HE HAD JUMPED THE GUN HE WENT BACK 
WITH THE WRONG WAY GETTING HAND 
FROM THE TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR THEN 
HE CAME BACK OUT TO THE BIGGEST 
CHEER OF THE NIGHT INSTANT 
CRUCIBLE FAVOURITE IT WAS A LOVELY 
MOMENT IT WAS NICE TO SEE SOME 
PERSONALITY COMING THROUGH 
THE ONE 
THING HE KNOWS HIS WERE THE POCKETS 
ARE HE IS KNOCKING THEM IN THE ALL 
OVER THE PLACE HE COULD NOT FIND 
THE TOILET EITHER THERE WERE 
CHINESE PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND OR IN 
THE POLICE TRYING TO FIND THEM HE HE KNOWS HIS WAY AROUND THE CRUCIBLE 
AND THE IN THE TABLE 
HE HAS BEEN 
PLAYING A LOT OF QUALIFIERS IN THE 
PAST COUPLE OF YEARS SO HE IS 
PRETTY MATCH FIT PROBABLY MORE SO 
THAN HIS OPPONENT TODAY THAT MAKES 
DIFFERENCE TO 
A PLAYER'S 
CONFERENCE CONFIDENCE 
HE IS 
HOLDING A NICE THREE TO ONE LEAD AT THE 
MOMENT THERE ARE A LOT COUPLE OF 
SESSIONS TO COMPLETE THE MATCH 
WE'RE GOING BACK TO BE LESS FOR THE 
COMMENTARY IN FRAME FIVE TWO 
DENNIS 
HOW MANY TIMES DO WE SAY THAT THE 
MID SESSION INTERVAL CAN TURN 
MATCH ROUND THAT WAS A VERY GOOD 
BREAK OFF 
LIANG WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE IN THE 
OPENING SESSION THAT WAS A BIT 
TOUGH EASY RETURN TO BAULK HE 
MIGHT LEAVE A RED ON IF HE TRIES TO 
POT THIS 
THE RED NEXT TO THE BLACK MUST NOT 
POT OR HE WOULD HAVE ATTEMPTED IT 
IT IS TOO TIGHT 
WOULDN'T BE BAD FOR JOE SWAIL TO 
GET INTO TACTICAL BATTLE MIGHT KNOCK LIANG OUT OF HIS STRIDE 
DEPENDS WHERE THE WHITE FINISHES 
NOW IF JOE CAN GET THE RED THE YELLOW HE HAS THE ADVANTAGE 
IT EVER WENT IN BUT LIANG DOES NOT 
HAVE AN EASY SAFETY HERE 
I THINK JOE WAS JUST CONCENTRATING 
ON TRYING TO GET GOOD CUE BALL 
THIS WOULD NOT BE AN EASY SHOT TO 
GET OUT HOPE FOR LIANG OUT OF FOR 
HE PLAYED A GOOD CUE BALL ALMOST 
WENT IN OFF BUT HE PLAYED IT WELL 
THIS WAS A GOOD SHOT 
WITH THE AID OF THE BROWN JOE HAS 
GOT THE WHITE EXACTLY WHERE HE HAD 
IT THE LAST TIME THERE IS A SAFETY 
SHOT ON 
THAT WAS THE TYPE OF SHOT THAT IS 
AVAILABLE AS LONG AS HE MISSES THE 
REDS ARE LEFT OUTSIDE OF THE TABLE 
ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE 
TABLE 
IT IS QUITE AMAZING A VERY SHORT 
HAS BEEN PLAYED FROM THAT CORNER OF 
THE TABLE EVERY SHOT 
JOE SWAIL 
WOULD NOT BE INCONVENIENCED BY A 
LITTLE BIT OF SAFETY PLAY AT THE 
START OF THIS FRAME LIANG HAS COME 
OUT STRONGLY AT THE START OF EACH 
SESSION HE COMES OUT ROARING AND 
HE IS REALLY UP FOR IT AS THE 
SESSION WEARS ON HE BECOMES 
SLIGHTLY LESS FOCUSED 
IT MAY TAKE BE EDGE OFF HIS GAME A 
LITTLE BIT OF PIT TAPPING AROUND 
HOW STRAIGHT IS HE ON THIS RED HE 
MIGHT TRY TO FORCE AN ANGLE 
WHAT ABOUT THAT FOR A SHORT SHOT 
THAT IS AS GOOD AS YOU WILL SEE 
THE FULL LENGTH OF THE TABLE 
PLAYED WITH THE BOTTOM THE WEIGHT 
SPINS BACK PERFECT CUEING 
HE MADE 
THAT LOOK EASY BUT IT IS ANYTHING 
BUT TERRIFIC SHOT 
A LITTLE UCKY IF HE MISSED THE 
FIRST RED HE WOULD HAVE HIT THE 
OTHER ONE FULL ON AND THEY MIGHT 
HAVE SPREAD LITTLE BIT BETTER 
HE IS A PLAYER THAT IT IS HARD TO 
KEEP AWAY FROM THE TABLE TERRIFIC 
LAST RED 
THAT OPENING POOR HE IS TIGHT ON 
THE CUSHION THAT WAS A LITTLE GEM 
OPENING POT 
WE WILL SHOW YOU THAT TERRIFIC 
SCREW BACK IF WE GET THE CHANCE 
HIS HAND IS ON THE CUSHION WE WILL 
SHOW YOU HE HAS GOT TO PUT RIGHT 
DOWN IT IS EASY TO JUMP THE BALL 
UPPING THE AIR BUT HE HAD IT 
ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON 
ONCE AGAIN NOR THE BEST POSITIONAL 
SHOT YOU ARE NEVER QUITE SURE THAT 
HE IS GOING TO MISS HIS NEXT RED 
HE PROBABLY MEANT TO MISS THAT ONE 
THERE AND GO TOWARDS THE WINS THE 
OTHER BLACK IT LOOKS AS IF THE 
BREAK HAS BROKEN DOWN A HAVE BEEN 
HE DIGS SUPPORT OUT FROM SOLAR 
AND THEN HE DIGS AT PORT OUT FROM 
SOMEWHERE 
YOU KIND OF NERVOUS LYCEE IN THE 
BREAK WITH THIS CHINESE PLAYER AT 
THE TABLE HE DESERVED THAT 
NERVOUSLY SAY 
A LITTLE BIT OF NOISE FROM THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE ARENA HE HELD UP 
HIS HAND TO APOLOGISE FOR LUCKY 
KISS ON THE YELLOW BUT WHEN YOU 
POT LIKE THAT HE DESERVED A LITTLE 
BIT OF LUCK 
HE TRIED TO CAN AND THE REDS AND 
THE BLACK AND MISSED THEM BY A LONG 
WAY CANNON 
CAN HE PULL ANOTHER POT OUT TO KEEP 
THIS BREAK GOING 
YOU CANNOT KEEP POTTING THE 
DIFFICULT ONES WHAT HE WAS DRIVING 
WAS THAT WAS THE LINE HE WAS 
LOOKING FOR HE JUST MISJUDGED 
THINGS HE DID NOT GET ANYWHERE 
NEAR WHAT HE WAS TRYING FOR 
JOE SWAIL MIGHT PLAY INTO THIS 
GROUP OF FOUR REDS NOW HE HAS 
FINISHED TOP SIDE OF THE BLUE HE 
COULD TRY TO GET INTO THE SAME FOUR 
REDS THAT LIANG TRIED TO 
THAT WOULD BE PERFECT BUT ANY 
CONTACT WOULD DEVELOP THE REDS THAT IS O. K. 
ANY CANNON WAS GOING TO OPEN THINGS 
THERE 
HE HAD A CHOICE OF REDS HE PLAYED 
THE POSITIVE ONE TO STAY ON THE 
BLACK HIS BRIDGING IS AWKWARD ON 
THE RED NEXT TO THE CUE BALL IT 
CUTS DOWN THEY ARE METAL WORK BACK 
THE AMOUNT OF WORK HE CAN PUT 
INTO THE CUE BALL 
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT WITH THIS 
HAMPERED CUEING 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE BROWN HE 
COULD JUST JUMP THE BLACK AND LEAVE 
THE RED THERE WHERE HIS TIP WAS 
JUST A DELICATE LITTLE DROP IN HE 
DOESN'T LIKE IT 
HAS TO GET A BIT OF SIDE ON THIS 
AND WEST 
THE YELLOW ON BACK 
UP 
IF HE 
POTS THE BROWN IS HE 
GOING TO DROP ON ONE THE ONE NEXT 
TO THE BLACK THAT ROUND OF 
APPLAUSE TELL YOU THAT THE RED DOES 
POT THERE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE IT 
THE PEOPLE ON THE FRONT ROW KNEW 
THAT HE WAS ON THIS RED AND THAT IS 
WHY THEY WAS LIKE A PLODDING 
THEY WERE APPLAUDING 
SLIGHT REACTION FROM JOE SWAIL 
AFTER THAT SHOT HE WAS NOT ON THE 
BLACK THAT IS HOW WE KNOW HE IS 
NOT ON THE BLACK JUST WALKED 
AWKWARD 
I MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE MATCH 
ABOUT LIANG WENBO PRACTISING WITH 
JOHN HIGGINS AT THE ACADEMY RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HAS PRACTISED WITH THIS 
YOUNG MAN AS WELL WHAT A GREAT 
EXPERIENCE IT MUST BE FOR THEM IT 
MUST GIVE HIM THE CONFIDENCE I I COULDN'T AGREE MORE GETTING THAT 
KIND OF PRACTICE IS INVALUABLE 
I THINK HE IS A QUICK LEARNER FROM 
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN GREAT COMPOSURE 
ON THE IMPORTANT SHOTS HE'S 
GETTING BETTER AT THE SAFETY PART 
OF HIS GAME AS WELL 
IT IS UNLUCKY TO PUSH A RED OVER 
THE CORNER POCKET 
HE WAS UNLUCKY TO KNOCK THE RED 
ALONG THE CUSHION AND LEAVE IT 
WHERE THE POCKET NEAR THE POCKET 
WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO WITH IT THIS 
TIME 
IT IS SO EASY TO RUN THE WHITE IN 
AFTER THAT RED FROM THAT POSITION 
IT ALMOST FOLLOWED THROUGH 
WILL HE TAKE ON THE POT OF THE 
BLACK HE REFUSES BE A LITTLE UP 
INTO THE CORNER BY THE LOOKS OF 
THINGS 
HE GOT A KICK THAT WAS NOT HIS 
FAULT 
AS SOON AS HE HIT THIS HE KNEW 
THAT IT WAS A BAD CONTACT AND THAT 
IT WASN'T IN 
I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT A TACTICAL 
BATTLE MAKE HELP JOE SWAIL BUT IF 
HE LOSES THE TACTICAL FRAME AS WELL 
THEN HE IS IN TROUBLE AT LEAST 
THIS WILL HAVE KNOCKED THE YOUNG 
CHINESE PLAYER OUT OF HIS STRIDE 
BEFORE THE INTERVAL HE WAS FLYING 
WITH BREAKS OF EIGHTY FOUR AND TWENTY IN THE 
OPENING FRAMES 
WHAT A FLUKE AND LOOK WHERE THE 
PINK IS GOING JOE SWAIL SMILES HE 
DIDN'T WELL THAT'S A RED HAD GONE 
IN HE DIDN'T KNOW 
I HAVE OVERSEEN THAT ONE BEFORE 
THIS YOUNG MAN IS CHARACTER NEVER SEEN THAT 
HE DID NOT EVEN SEE THE RED GOING 
IN AND HE WENT AND SAT DOWN 
FANTASTIC 
JOE SWAIL IS STILL SMILING IN THE 
BACKGROUND 
JOE SWAIL DID WELL HE BACKGROUND COULDN'T HELP BUT LAUGH ABOUT WHAT 
FOLLOWED L. HAVE DONE A SEEN THAT 
BEFORE PLAYER NOT KNOWING THAT 
THE BALL HAS GOING IN 
UNBELIEVABLE 
JOE SWAIL IS SAYING IT IS STILL 
YOU'RE SHORT ONE WENT IN YOUR 
SHOT WE TALK ABOUT THE TACTICAL 
BATTLE WITH ALL THE REDS BEEN SAVED 
AND THAT SITTING JOE SWAIL BUT 
LOOK CATCH THEM NOW BEING SAFE 
AND IT THEY TALK ABOUT THE LUCK OF 
THE IRISH 
IT WAS A TERRIBLE SHOCK 
ADMITTING MOOD IT WAS A TERRIBLE 
SHOT EVERYTHING MOVED 
HE HAS GOT HIS COMPOSURE BACK IT 
IS TROUBLING INTO A TERRIFIC CHANCE 
NOW TURNING HE IS ODDS ON TO TAKE THE FRAME NOW HE IS LAUGHING AWAY 
BUT THE LAUGHING HAS ALL STOPPED 
NOW AT LIANG WENBO IS GOING TO 
CLINCH THE FRAME AFTER OF BAD VERY 
UNUSUAL FLUKE THAT HE DID NOT 
REALISE THAT HE HAD PULLED OFF 
AFTER THAT 
I HAVE SEEMED STEVE DAVIS AND JOHN 
PARROTT FLUKED LOT OF BALLS I 
HAVE SEEN BUT THEY ALWAYS KNEW 
WHEN THEY HAD FLUKED THEM 
JOE COMING TO THE TABLE BUT LIANG 
SHOULD WIN THE FRAME FORTY FOUR BEHIND THIRTY FIVE 
ON THE TABLE NOT A BAD EFFORT 
PLAYED THIS AS IF HE WAS TRYING TO 
SHOOT THE WHITE INTO THE POCKET 
SURELY HE HASN'T POTTED IT JOE IS 
STILL SMILING JOE IS ONE OF THE 
MOST LIKEABLE LADS YOU CAN MEET 
BUT LIANG IS BECOMING A CROWD 
FAVOURITE A BIT OF FUN BETWEEN 
THEM THERE 
LOOKS GOOD TO ME JOE SWAIL 
CONCEDES IT WAS TERRIFIC LOOK 
FROM A YOUNG CHINESE PLAYER THAT 
GAVE HIM THE FRAME HE EXTENDS HIS 
LEAD TO FOUR TO ONE 
THIS IS BEING PLAYED 
IN A GREAT SPIRIT AND THIS FELLOW 
IS A NATURAL 
HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW 
WHAT HE HAD DONE IT WAS HILARIOUS 
HE IS LIKE THE CHINESE MR. BEAN BUT 
HE IS PLAYING WITH A SMILE ON HIS 
FACE AND SO WAS JOE SWAIL 
BUT HIS 
REACTION WAS CHARMING 
YES IT IS 
HOW TO SUM UP THE CHARACTERS OF THE 
CHINESE PLAYERS IF YOU DO NOT 
UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE BUT I 
WOULD IMAGINE THAT CHINESE SNOOKER 
FANS WOULD WARM TO LIANG WENBO AS 
THE CRUCIBLE IS WARMING TO HIM HE 
IS A FANTASTIC PLAYER 
HE DOES NOT 
GIVE MUCH AWAY 
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE 
IN CONTROL BUT CREDIT TO JOE SWAIL 
THAT IS THE BIGGEST FLUKE I HAVE 
EVER SEEN IT HAS PUSHED BALLS OFF 
CUSHIONS AND HAS DONE DAMAGE TO THE 
TABLE TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE LIANG 
WENBO CUT IN A MISSABLE PINK AND 
RECALLING TO WIN THE FRAME JOE 
SWAIL HAS TAKEN IT ON THE CHIN 
THE CROWD IS WARMING TO HIM THAT 
IS TERRIFIC HE IS THE LAST OF THE 
CHINESE PLAYERS TO MAKE IT THROUGH 
HE IS ACQUITTING HIMSELF WELL 
APART FROM THE THE VALUE HE HIS 
HE IS GOOD VALUE AS A TOP CLASS 
COMEDY VALUE TOP CLASS SNOOKER 
PLAYER A HEALTHY LEAD FOR LIANG 
WENBO 
I COULD NOT AGREE MORE WITH THE 
BOYS IN THE STUDIO VERY ENJOYABLE 
SESSION TO WATCH SEEING ALL THE 
GOOD POTS AND ALL THE THINGS I 
HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE LIKE THAT 
LAST FRAME 
JOE LOOKS A BIT RATTLED TO ME AT 
THE MOMENT 
HE IS SUCH A GOOD LONG 
POTTER JOE BUT UNDER THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES THOSE OF VERY TOUGH 
SHOT BUT HE'S TRYING TO MAKE 
SOMETHING HAPPEN 
THAT WAS A THIN ONE AND HE OVER 
CUT IT A BIT OF A CHANCE FOR JOE 
ALTHOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL 
THIS KIND OF SHOT WHEN THE RED IS 
SO CLOSE TO THE POCKET NEEDS TO 
PLAY IT WITH LOTS OF LEFT HAND SIDE 
HERE JUST TO TRY AND BRING IT OUT 
ON TO THE TABLE 
HE HAS PLAYED THE THIN ONE HE HAS 
HIT IT TOO THIN AND NOW HE IS ON 
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
HE HAS GONE FROM ONE CORNER POCKET 
TO THE OTHER CORNER POCKET HE 
COULDN'T PLAY THAT SHOT IF HE TRIED 
IT 
NO ONE LIKES PLAYING SHOTS FROM THE 
JAWS OF THE POCKET LIKE THAT I CAN 
TELL YOU MY WORD THAT WAS TRICKY 
THAT WAS HARD SHOT TO GO FOR 
ESPECIALLY WITH THE GANG IN THE 
FORM THAT HE IS LIANG THAT WAS 
SO TOUGH HE COULD HAVE REFUSED 
THAT HE WANTS TO MAKE SOMETHING 
HAPPEN BUT THAT WAS VERY RISKY 
THERE IS TO LOSE REDS BUT I LIKE 
THE WAY THIS PLAYER GOES INTO THE 
BUNCH TWO LOOSE REDS WATCH THE 
ACTION THAT HE GETS ON THE CUE BALL 
THE WHITE STOPS AND THEN SPINS 
AGAIN FOR A SECOND TIME BUT HE 
DIDN'T CATCH THEM AS HE INTENDED 
SO END OF BREAK 
I SUPPOSE JOE COULD LOOK AT THAT 
AND SAY THAT HE GOT AWAY WITH IT 
AFTER THE SHOT THAT HE PLAYED ON 
THE YELLOW FROM THE POCKET 
HE HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL WITH THIS 
SAFETY WITH THAT RED ON THE LEFT 
OF THE TABLE HE HAS NOT HAD AN 
EASY SHOT HERE AT ALL IF THE 
SAFETY SHOT BE SHORT HE MIGHT 
LEAVE THAT RED POTTABLE 
HE HAD TO AVOID THE BOLD COLOURS 
BAULK COLOURS THAT WAS ALWAYS 
GOING TO BE THE WORRY 
JOE'S LAST SHOT SAFETY SHOT I 
THOUGHT HE COULD HAVE COME DOWN THE 
TABLE I'M SURPRISED HE PLAYED THE 
BUNCH IT SEEMED A STRAIGHT FORWARD 
UP AND DOWN THAT WOULD HAVE 
REMOVED THE RED THAT LIANG HAS 
POTTED IT THERE 
HE HAD A SAFETY SHOT JOE THAT IS 
THE SHOT I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE 
PLAYED HE WOULD HAVE REMOVED THAT 
ONE TOOK THE RISK UNLUCKY TO 
CATCH THE GREEN 
IS HE GOING TO GO STRAIGHT INTO THE 
PINK HERE 
THAT TELLS ME THAT HE IS DEFINITELY 
GOING TO TAKE IT ON HE IS JUST 
MAKING SURE THERE ARE NO PLANTS 
AROUND MAKE SURE HE POTS THE BLUE 
AND HE COULD OPEN UP MOST OF THE 
REDS HERE 
IT IS A BIT THIN THOUGH HE HAS 
LOOKED AT THE BROWN TO PLAY FOR THE 
LOOSE RED BUT THE BLUE IS THE SHOT 
HE WANTS TO TAKE ON AND HE IS 
PERFECTLY PLAYED FANTASTIC HE 
REALLY 
PLAY THAT SHOT SO WELL 
THINK HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT A PLANT 
AND A COUPLE OF REDS WENT CLOSE TO 
CORNER POCKET CORNER POCKETS 
THE SHOT HE PLAYED JUST WATCH THE 
CUE GOING THROUGH HERE WATCH WHAT 
FINISHES RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH 
THAT IS THE SECRET OF THOSE TYPE OF 
SHOT YOU HAVE GOT TO PUSH THE CUE 
THROUGH 
YOU GET A CLUB PLAYER PERHAPS HE 
MAY HIT THE CUE AT THE BALL RATHER 
THAN THROUGH IT LIANG GOES RIGHT 
THROUGH SAW HIM PLAY A DEEP 
SCREW EARLY RUN THE MATCH WHICH WAS 
IMPRESSIVE EARLIER IN THE MATCH 
THOSE SHOTS ARE ALL ABOUT TECHNIQUE 
HE WAS A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT GOING 
INTO THAT PACK HE THOUGHT IT WAS LITTLE AWKWARD 
NOW HE HAS DONE IT IT WAS 
UNDOUBTEDLY THE RIGHT SHOT YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT THOSE REDS ARE WENT 
INDIA I THE POCKET BUT HE REALLY 
HAD A GOOD LOOK AT THE BUNCH 
JUST BEFORE THIS HE HAD LOOKED 
CLOSELY AT THE PACK HE KNEW THAT 
IF YOU MIGHT GO NEAR THE CORNER 
POCKETS BUT IT WAS A TERRIFIC SHOT 
A FEW MIGHT GO NEAR THE CORNER 
POCKETS 
HE JUST NEEDS TO KEEP HIS 
CONCENTRATION THERE IS NOT AN 
AWFUL LOT THAT IS DIFFICULT HERE 
OF THE TWO REDS CLOSE TOGETHER THE 
ONE AT THE BOTTOM WILL POT HE'S 
MAKING SURE THAT HE DOES NOT GO TOO 
FAR IT IS THE RED AT THE BOTTOM OF 
THE TWO THAT HE WANTS TO LAND ON THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FINE 
HE IS POTTING WELL HE IS LOOKING 
IN THE BIG BREAKS WHEN HE GETS A 
CHANCE KNOCKING IN AND SUDDENLY 
OUT OF THE BLUE HE MISSES A BLACK 
OFF THE SPOT WHEN HE WAS ALMOST 
PAST THE WINNING LINE L. DON'T 
THINK THAT KICKED MAYBE IT DID 
MAYBE WE ARE DOING HIM AN INJUSTICE 
THE WHITE IS BEING CLEANED MAYBE 
HE GOT A BAD CONTACT THERE BECAUSE 
HE HAS MISSED PRECIOUS LITTLE 
MAYBE THAT WASN'T HIS FAULT 
AT FIRST GLANCE I DIDN'T THINK IT 
WAS BAD CONTACT 
I CAN SEE IF IT WRONG WITH THAT TO 
BE TRUTHFUL I COULDN'T SEE 
ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT EITHER 
WAY IT MAY PROVE SIGNIFICANT 
THE FRAME LOOKED JUST ABOUT ALL 
OVER 
HE HAS GOT THE PERFECT ANGLE ON THE 
PINK HE COULD LEAVE HIMSELF ON A 
CHOICE OF THREE REDS IF HE JUST 
STONES IN BETWEEN TWO OF THEM 
STONES THAT IS NOT BAD 
JUST SHOWS YOU HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO 
THE SPECTATORS 
NOT MANY SPORTS WAY YOU CAN GET 
THIS CLOSE TO THE ACTION WHERE 
YOU CAN GET IT 
THAT WAS A REASONABLY COMFORTABLE 
RED THAT WILL ANNOY JOE 
YOU CAN SEE WHERE HE WANTS TO PUT 
THE RIGHT BEING A LEFT HANDER 
THAT RED WILL BE O. K. FOR HIM RIGHT 
IN THE HEART OF THE POCKET 
LOOKS A LITTLE BIT STRAIGHT HERE 
HE MAY HAVE TO SCREW BACK 
NORMALLY YOU WOULD SCREW BACK FOR 
THE BLUE TRY AND GET THE WHITE 
AWAY FROM THE CUSHION 
HE KNEW THE SCORE HE CHECKED THE 
SCOREBOARD AS HE DOES AGAIN NOW 
JOE NEEDS A SNOOKER THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL SHOT 
FIFTY ONE THE DIFFERENCE OF FORTY THREE LEFT JOE 
IS NEEDING TWO SNOOKERS 
I THINK THE RED WILL CUT PINK HE 
IS JUST TAKING A LOOK WILL CUT 
IN ONE MORE RED WILL GUARANTEE THE 
FRAME FRAME 
WE ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT FIVE TO ONE 
NOW 
HITS THOSE SHOT VERY SWEETLY 
THOSE SHOTS HE'S GOING TO BE A 
TOUGH PLAYER TO BEAT IN THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
SEEMS TO BE IN THE FORM OF HIS LIFE 
AND VASTLY IMPROVED JOE SWAIL HAS 
CONCEDED THE FRAME POSTOP 
WHILST THEY RE RACK LET'S TAKE A 
QUICK CHECK ON OUR IT'S BECOME 
MASTERPIECE THE WORK IN PROGRESS 
FROM ARTIST TOM WALKER 
WE'RE BACK HERE WITHOUT RESIDENT 
ARTIST TOM WALKER WE HAVE MISSED 
YOU FOR A FEW DAYS HOW IS IT 
GOING 
IT IS COMING ON ALL RIGHT GOING BEGINNING TO REBUILD TUDOR SQUARE 
ON THIS SIDE WE HAVE THE KIND OF 
FANTASY WHICH IS BASED ON REALITY 
SOME SNOOKER ROTATIONS GOING ON 
INCLUDING AN ALIEN VISIT AND DID 
A GENTLEMAN WHO HAS DROPPED OFF 
FROM THE SAUCER ON THIS SIDE WE 
COME IN TO THE FACTUAL SIDE THE 
BIG SCREEN THE LYCEUM THEATRE AS 
WE GO ACROSS HERE NOT MANY PEOPLE 
IT IS THAT YOU HAVE GOT THE 
TRIANGLE IN THE DESIGN IN THE REAL 
THEATRE HERE IT IS EMERGING INTO 
THE SNOOKER TABLE TAKE IT A BIT 
FURTHER ANYBODY RECOGNISE THAT 
NAPOLEON IF YOU LOOK IN THE SQUARE 
YOU WILL SEE HIM QUITE CLEARLY 
THERE THE REASON I PUT HIM IN HIS 
BECAUSE WHEN SHE THOUGHT WAS AT ITS 
HEIGHT AS A STEEL PRODUCER IN 
NAPOLEONIC TIMES AS THE GREATEST 
STEEL PRODUCER NAPOLEON OFFERED A 
HUGE CASH REWARD TO ANYBODY OF HIS 
ALLIES HE COULD MAKE STEEL AS GOOD 
AS SHEFFIELD 
SNOOKER PLAYERS ARE 
CRITICAL OF THE RUN PERFORMANCES 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU HAVE 
DONE 
VERY HAPPY WOULD BE PUSHING DONE IT I WOULD SAVE REALLY HAPPY AS AS YOU ARE GOING A LONG ARE THINGS 
CHANGING OR ARE THEY JUST COMING 
TO YOU 
THEY ARE CHANGING NAPOLEON 
WAS NEVER IN THE PICTURE BEFORE HE 
HAS CREPT IN LIKE A FRENCH SPY WE WE WILL LEAD YOU TO DO YOUR HARD WORK 
NICE TO SEE EXCELLENT 
SOMETHING FOR 
EVERYONE NAPOLEON AND ALIENS 
BACK TO THE MATCH 
JOE SWAIL COULD DO IT WITH THE 
REMAINING TWO ARE FRIENDS OF THE 
SESSION JOE SWAIL COULD DO WITH 
THE REMAINING TWO FRAMES OF THIS 
SESSION THIS WILL BE SAFETY SHOT 
SENDING THE RED TOWARDS THE RED 
NEAR THE CORNER POCKET BUT IT IS 
COVERED ANYWAY 
HE POTTED ONE RED ONTO THE OTHER 
BUT THE BROWN HAS COME TO HIS 
RESCUE HE PLANTED ONE RED ONTO 
THE OTHER 
JOE HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL HE HAS 
TO HIDE THE WHITE 
IT IS NOT EASY FOR WAY HE SITUATED 
TO GET THE WHITE BACK 
HE NEEDS TO GET THE WHITE TIGHT ON 
THE CUSHION AUDIO WILL TAKE THE 
RED ON OR LIANG WILL TAKE THE 
RED ON JOE KNEW HE HAD TO GET GOOD WHITE AND HE DIDN'T 
HE HAS HAD A LOOK THE BLACK THERE 
BUT IT IS TOO DIFFICULT TO HOLD FOR 
THE BLACK 
HE PLAYED IT WELL AND MAYBE WHEN 
HE WAS LOOKING AT THE BLACK HE WAS 
LOOKING AT THE RED NEXT TO THE 
BLACK THAT IS WHAT HE WAS LOOKING 
AT 
IF THE RED GOES HE HAS GOT AN 
ANGLE TO GET UP TO THAT POSITION 
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT POT IF IT 
POT HE HAS PLAYED FOR THE THREE REDS 
IT IS A BIT TIGHT BUT I THINK IT 
WILL GO EVENTUALLY 
IF HE'S STRAIGHT ON THE PINK HE 
CAN RUN THROUGH ON TO THAT RED HE 
HAS JUST DISCOVERED IT HE CAN SEE 
THAT IT WILL CERTAINLY GO 
STILL QUITE A FEW AVAILABLE INTO 
THE LEFT CORNER WHEREAS THE PINK 
GOING WHERE IS THE PINK GOING 
AS NEAR TO ITS ORIGINAL SPOT AS 
POSSIBLE 
THE PINK STILL SHOULD BE AVAILABLE 
INTO THE RIGHT CORNER HE CAN PLAY 
FOR THE PINK AGAIN 
HE IS WANTED THE CUE BALL CLEANED 
THERE HE IS BACK LOOKING AT THIS 
RED NEXT TO THE BLACK IT 
DEFINITELY POT BUT IT MUST LOOK 
TIGHT FROM HIS ANKLE 
I'M ALWAYS 
AMAZED THAT PLAYERS DO NOT LOOK 
BEHIND THE POCKETS AT THOSE SHOTS 
YOU CAN SEE FROM OUR CAMERA ANGLE 
THAT IT DEFINITELY DOES POT 
PLAYERS OFTEN LOOK FROM THEIR OWN 
PERSPECTIVE IT IS NOT ALWAYS SO 
CLEAR CUT TO SEE 
I HOPE HE HASN'T BEEN WATCHING ANY 
OF THE OLD FRED DAVIS VIDEOS HE 
USED TO LOOK AND LOOK YOU WOULD 
THINK HE WAS OUT OF POSITION THEN 
HE WOULD GET DOWN AND PUT IT AND 
THE CROWD WOULD APPLAUD A CLEVER 
OLD PLAYER BUT THAT RED DEFINITELY 
POT POTS 
NICE CANNON ONCE AGAIN HE HAS 
OPENED THINGS UP 
WHEN YOU PLAY THREE SYSTEMS YOU 
TARGET IS TO TRY AND WIN THEM FIVE TO THREE 
THREE SESSIONS HE'S ALREADY AT 
THE FIVE FRAMES THAT HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN LOOKING FOR BUT HE WANTS TO 
PUSH ON THIS MIGHT CONCLUDE WITH 
TWO MORE SESSIONS TOMORROW THIS 
MATCH CONCLUDES WHAT IS THAT LEAD 
GOING TO BE 
I SUPPOSE IS HAS TO BE SAID JOE 
SWAIL HAS NOT HAD GREAT DEAL OF 
CHANCES JUST FEW MISTAKES HE HAS MADE 
HE HAS BEEN OUTPLAYED NO MADE DOUBT ABOUT THAT BUT IT IS NOT 
LIKE HE HAS DONE AN AWFUL LOT WRONG 
PERHAPS HE SHOULD HAVE WON THE LAST 
FRAMES HE HAS NOT HAD THE BEST OF 
LUCK EITHER HE HAD A LAUGH WHEN 
LIANG WENBO FLICKED THAT SHOT AND 
DIDN'T KNOW 
DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE ON THE PINK 
THERE HE PLAYED IT WELL 
THE FACT THAT HE HAS PUSHED A 
COUPLE OF REDS AWKWARD IS IN HIS 
FAVOUR 
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOUNG PLAYERS 
THAT CAN DO THE CRUCIBLE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME SOMETIMES YOU TALK 
ABOUT THEIR SHOT SELECTION MAYBE 
NOT BEING THE CORRECT CHOICE LIKE 
TO YOU ONE THING ABOUT THIS YOUNG 
MAN HIS SHOT SELECTION HAS BEEN 
SUPERB 
IF HE WAS GOING TO MAKE HIS CENTURY 
HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TRIED TO 
SCREW FURTHER ACROSS SO HE COULD 
DEVELOP THE THREE REDS 
HE MIGHT STILL BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT 
HE'S GOT TO GET INTO THE CUE BALL 
HE HAS MISSED THEM IT IS PROBABLY 
END OF BREAK IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY 
DIFFERENCE THERE BECAUSE AT THE END 
HE IS STARTING TO DRAW AWAY NOW IN 
THIS MATCH 
ONCE AGAIN HE ONLY NEEDED ONE 
CHANCE AND THAT BREAK OF SEVENTY EIGHT HAS 
GIVEN LIANG WENBO ANOTHER FRAME SIX 
ONE TO THIS CHINESE PLAYER 
IT IS BEGINNING TO LOOK OMINOUS FOR 
JOE SWAIL PUT YOURSELF IN HIS 
SHOES HOW MUCH OF A SINKING 
FEELING WOULD YOU BE GETTING AT 
THIS STAGE 
A FAIR BIT BECAUSE AN 
UNKNOWN QUANTITY BEFORE THE START 
A YOUNG PLAYER COMING THROUGH IT 
IS ALWAYS IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND 
HE WOULD PREFER TO PLAY AN 
ESTABLISHED PLAYER THAT HAS NOT 
GONE SO FAR IN THE GAME THAN AN 
UNKNOWN PLAYER ALL OF A SUDDEN 
YOU SEE THIS NEW PLAYER ON THE 
BLOCK OUT PLAYING YOU IN ALL 
DEPARTMENTS AND IT DAWNS ON YOU HE 
IS PLAYING A LOT BETTER THAN YOU 
AND IS GOING TO CONTINUE THROUGHOUT 
THE MATCH THAT SINKING FEELING 
GROWS YOU HAVE TO BE VERY PATIENT 
BUT IT IS TOUGH 
MUCH MORE 
DIFFICULT JOHN BECAUSE IF YOU 
HAVE NEVER PLAYED THIS PARTICULAR 
PLAYER HE DO NOT KNOW THEIR 
WEAKNESSES AND WHAT TO CONCENTRATE 
ON 
ABSOLUTELY HE IS VERY MUCH AN ON UNKNOWN QUANTITY L. DON'T THINK SHE 
HAD EVER SEEN HIM PLAY WE HAVE 
SEEN IN THE QUALIFIERS BUT JOE 
HASN'T HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO 
EXPECT NOW HE DOES HE IS SIX TO ONE 
BEHIND IF HE LOSES THE NEXT FRAME 
THERE IS NO WAY IS GOING TO WIN 
THIS MATCH 
HE WILL KNOW THAT AND 
IT HAS EFFECTIVELY DAMAGE 
LIMITATION IN THE FINAL FRAME THE THE PRESSURE IS BEING PUT ON BY A GREAT 
PLAY BY LIANG WENBO HE IS COMPOSED 
AS WELL HE IS NOT JUST A FLASH IN 
THE PAN POTTER AS WE HAVE SEEN AT 
THE CRUCIBLE THEY SHOW PROMISE BUT 
FINALLY UNRAVEL THIS GUY DOESN'T 
LOOK LIKE HE WILL UNRAVEL SOMEBODY 
HAS TO UNRAVEL HIM THAT IS A 
DIFFERENT PROSPECT 
NO ONE HAS 
ACTUALLY GOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO PUT A 
SQUEEZE ON HIM TO PUT ANY PRESSURE 
ARTS A TO PUT ANY PRESSURE ON HIM 
YET 
IT IS IMPONDERABLE AT THE YET MINUTE HE IS NOT WORRIED HE KEEPS 
WINNING 
THE LAST FRAME OF THE WINNING SESSION 
YES IT IS DOWN TO DAMAGE 
LIMITATION NOW FOR JOE SWAIL AS 
JOHN PARROTT SAYS SEVEN TO ONE WOULD BE A 
HEFTY DEFICIT TO TAKE INTO TOMORROW TERRIFIC CUEING 
WELL YOU HAVE CREATED THAT CHANCE 
JOE WITH A FANTASTIC LONG RED IT 
WOULD BE NICE TO SEE HER NOT IF YOU 
IN HERE L. THINK THIS IS THE FIRST 
TIME THAT JOE HAS BEEN IN AND 
AROUND THE BLACK SPOT EARLIER IN 
THE WHOLE SESSION THERE IS ONLY 
ONE AT LEAST READ THE ONLY ONE 
LOOSE BREADTH ZERO RED 
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GO INTO THE 
PACK OF REDS FROM THE BLUE YOU 
WOULD STAY ON THE BLACK HERE THOUGH 
OH JOE HE HAS MISSED THAT 
COMPLETELY BECAUSE LOOK WHERE THE 
WHITE HAS FINISHED HE WAS NOWHERE 
NEAR 
EVERYTHING WENT WRONG WITH THAT 
LAST SHOT OF JOE'S HE WAS TRYING 
TO POT THE BLACK GET THE WHITE 
WHERE A PUT THE OTHER LITTLE WHITE 
BECAUSE HE MISSED THE BLACK THICK 
THE WHITE PULLED UP SHORT 
I THINK THIS YEAR AND PLAYER HAS 
PUT JOE AND SO MUCH PRESSURE AND 
HAVE THE KNACK SHOT WORKS OUT HE 
WILL OPEN MOST OF THE REDS UP 
THE NEXT SHOT WE KNOW HOW WELL HE 
PLAYS THE SHOT JUST WATCH THE CUE 
BALL AS HE GOES INTO THE REDS HOW 
IT SHORT OF STAYS THERE THAT'S 
FANTASTIC 
HE GOT THE PLANT THERE HE HAS 
MANAGED TO KNOCK THE READING I I THINK HE WENT INTO THEM TOO FIRMLY 
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO PLAY THEM AT 
THIS SPEED YOU ARE LUCKY TO KNOCK 
THEIR READING BUT YOU MIGHT DO A 
RED IN 
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO WORRY TOO 
MUCH ABOUT THE AWKWARD REDS HE 
DOESN'T REALLY NEED THEM 
HE PROBABLY NEEDS ONE OF THE SAFE 
REDS AND THAT WILL BE ALL 
THAT WASN'T A GREAT SHOT WAS IT 
IT IS A VERY THIN ONE NOW AND HE IS 
VERY CLOSE TO THE RED BALL HE 
NEEDS BROWN OR ABOVE 
SIR IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE SIX TO TWO 
A QUICK GLANCE AT THE SCOREBOARD 
THERE HE COULD BECOME THE CRUCIBLE 
COMEBACK KID 
SO THE FRAME IS SAFE AND IT HAS 
BEEN FOR A COUPLE OF SHOTS NOW 
WELL DONE JOE SWAIL BADLY NEEDED 
THIS LAST FRAME OF THE SESSION 
AND LIANG WENBO CONCEDES IT HAS 
BEEN THE CHINAMAN IS GAME ABOUT JOE 
SWAIL FIGHTS BACK BUT JOE SWAIL 
I AM SURE JOE SWAIL WILL BE 
MIGHTILY RELIEVED BUT I THINK IT IS 
LIANG WENBO WHO WILL SLEEP EASIER 
THIS 
EVENING BACK 
INTO THE MATCH 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARENA ON 
TABLE TO WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING 
THE FORTUNES OF JOE PERRY A FEW 
YEARS AGO HE WAS QUARTER 
FINALIST AT THE CRUCIBLE BUT IT HAS 
TAKEN HIM FOR YEARS TO GET BACK 
INTO THE SECOND ROUND HE IS 
DELIGHTED TO BE SPLAYING IN THE 
SECOND WEEK THIS TIME TO BE 
PLAYING 
YOU DON'T WANT TO TURN UP COULD BE 
BEATEN AND GO HOME BEFORE THE 
TOURNAMENT IS IN FULL SWING WE ARE 
APPROACHING THE SECOND WEEK NOW AND 
IT TO BE STILL INVOLVED IS WHAT 
EVERYONE WANTS TO DO I'M STILL IN 
IT AND THEREFORE I AM HAPPY AND 
LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING 
IT'S DEFINITELY THE BEST I'VE 
PLAYED AT THE CRUCIBLE FOR QUITE A 
LONG TIME L. HAVE SUFFERED A COUPLE 
OF HEAVY FIRST ROUND DEFEATS IN THE 
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS TO PLAY AS 
GOOD AS I DID WAS PLEASING FOR ME 
I'VE HAD A FEW UPS AND A FEW DANCE 
AT THE CRUCIBLE LIKE MOST PLAYERS 
THE PLAY EVERY SESSION LIKE IT IS 
YOUR LAST YOU TRY AND WIN EVERY 
SESSION BUT I DON'T THINK THE 
MATCH IS LONG ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN 
AFFORD TO HAVE A BAD SESSION 
DROPPING TO A THREE FRAMES BEHIND 
ISN'T TOO BAD YOU CAN DIG YOURSELF 
OUT OF IT THE WAY THIS GAME IS 
TODAY YOU CANNOT AFFORD ONE BAD 
SESSION THE PRESSURES ON FROM THE 
WORD GO WE ARE BOTH UP FOR THE 
BATTLE AND ARE READY FOR WHAT 
PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO THROW AT US 
IT IS NOT NICE WHEN PEOPLE COME 
BACK AT YOU BUT TO COME BACK AND TO 
GET THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE IS 
ALWAYS PLEASING WE BOTH KNOW WE 
HAVE THAT PART OF OUR GAME IN GOOD 
ORDER I JUST HOPE THE REST CLICKS 
INTO PLACE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT THESE 
PLAYERS HAVE GOT THEIR NAME ON THE 
TROPHY THEY ARE ALL GOOD ENOUGH 
AND THEY PROVED IT IT HAS GIVEN 
EVERYONE A LITTLE BIT OF BELIEVE 
THAT IT IS THERE FOR ANYONE IF YOU 
CAN FIND YOUR BEST FORM AND FIND A 
LITTLE BIT OF LUCK IN THESE FEW 
WEEKS THEN MAYBE WE CAN ALL FULFIL 
OUR DREAMS 
JOE PERRY IS PLAYING 
STUART BINGHAM 
HOW HAS IT GONE IN AT THAT ANGLE 
THAT'S AMAZING L. DON'T THINK A 
SEEN A BALL GO IN THE POCKET AT THE 
SPEED THAT IS AMAZING INCREDIBLE 
STUART BINGHAM WAS SHAKING HIS HEAD 
THERE AS HE WENT BACK TO HIS CHAIR 
EVEN THOUGH HE IS THIRTY SIX POINTS BEHIND 
IF BALLS ARE PERFECT THE BALLS 
ARE PERFECT 
HE WAS THIRTY SEVEN N. T. S. BEHIND WHEN HE CAME TO THE TABLE HE COULDN'T BE IN A MUCH BETTER 
POSITION THERE IS ONE DOWN ON THE 
BOTTOM CUSHION HERE PLAYERS DON'T 
MIND THAT THAT IS WHEN IT IS ON 
THE SIDE CUSHION OR THE BAULK 
CUSHION IT IS PROBLEM IT HAS STILL GOT TO BE DONE FOR THEM 
THIS IS THE KEY SHOT HE DIDN'T 
WANT TO FINISH STRAIGHT HE HASN'T 
FINISHED STRAIGHT HE IS PERFECT ON 
THIS THESE POCKETS YOU CAN'T 
MISS ANYTHING AT THE MERE DRAW 
NEAR JAW HONESTLY HE COULD HAVE 
PLAYED OUT IN TO ROLL IN 
STUART HAS BEEN A BIT CARELESS 
THERE THAT IS A DREADFUL SHOT HE 
NEEDED TO BE WELL UP THE TABLE 
THERE IF HE CAN SEE THE GREEN HE 
HAS BEEN FORTUNATE 
HE PLAYED THAT NICELY HE PLAYED 
WITH A LOT OF CHECK SIDE THERE IT 
SLOWED THE WHITE DOWN AND MAKE SURE 
THE BLUE WOULD NOT BE HAMPERING HIM 
FOR THE GREEN THAT IS A TOUGH SHOT 
TO PLAY 
A M. SHAW STUART A FEW MOMENTS AGO 
THOUGHT HE WILL HAVE MISSED THE 
BOAT ON THIS ONE I AM SURE STUART BINGHAM WILL BE DELIGHTED 
JOE PERRY HAS WON BOTH OF THEIR 
PREVIOUS MATCHES TO DATE BUT IT IS 
STUART BINGHAM WHO HAS BEEN IN VERY 
GOOD FORM AND HAS WON THE HAS MADE 
THE MORE POSITIVE START INTO THE 
NEXT WE GO PERRY HAS ESTABLISHED A 
FIFTY TWO POINTS LEAD HERE 
NOW THEN LET'S HAVE A SMILE JOE 
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY AFTER 
THAT 
A GREAT POT THE GREEN IS AVAILABLE 
IF IT IS NOT STRAIGHT 
HE IS ON THE RED IN THE MIDDLE HE 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO POT IT AND STUN 
THE CUE BALL OF TWO CUSHIONS DOWN 
FOR THE BLACK OFF 
EXCELLENT EXECUTION FROM STUART 
BINGHAM WE MENTIONED IN THE LAST 
FRAME WHEN THE FIRST FORTY OR FIFTY ARE 
TOUGH THIS HAS BEEN A FRAME WHERE 
JOE PERRY HAS GOT THE FIRST FORTY OR 
FIFTY CAN STUART BINGHAM DO A 
COUNTERACT CLEARANCE 
HE MISSED KIND THAT COMPLETELY AS 
THINGS ARE HE IS TAKING HIS TIME 
HERE SO PERHAPS THE CUE IS AWKWARD 
YES I THINK IT IS TIME TO BITE THE 
BULLET HERE DROP UP ON THE YELLOW 
GOOD SHOT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF 
HELP WITH THE RED WHERE IS THE RED 
GOING IS THERE A GAP BETWEEN FOR 
RED AND BLACK IT WOULD BE UNLUCKY 
IF THERE WAS SURELY NOT 
HE PLAYED IT NICELY CODE AND MAYBE 
SHOULD WIN OF THE FRAME NOW HE 
AVOIDED THE BOUNCE ON PINK 
THE ANGLE ON THE PINK OR BLACK 
KNEES TO BE SUCH THAT HE CAN GET ON 
TO THE RED EASILY YOU DON'T WANT 
TO BE STRAIGHT ON EITHER THE PACK 
THE PINK OR BLACK 
THE PINK IS THE EASIER POT 
OBVIOUSLY HE IS JUST CHECKING THE SCOREBOARD 
I DON'T THINK IT MAKES MUCH 
DIFFERENCE WHAT COLOUR HE GETS OFF 
THIS LAST RED ALL THE BALLS ARE 
WELL SAID AND HE HAS PLAYED THAT 
QUITE WELL 
I THINK YOU SHOULD ALWAYS GO ON TO 
THE BAULK COLOURS OF THE LAST RED 
UNLESS YOU NEED ONE OF THE BIGGER 
COLOURS IF THERE IS BIT AWKWARD 
THERE YOU OFTEN NEED A BIGGER 
COLOURS TO WIN THE FRAME ONCE 
AGAIN HE HAS LOST THE CUE BALL A 
LITTLE THAT NOT ENOUGH TO PUT HIM 
OUT OF POSITION 
JUST ABOUT GOT BACK INTO THE CORNER 
OF THE POCKET OBVIOUSLY HE IS 
FEEDING THE PRESSURE HE'S LOOKING 
A BIT UNSETTLED FEELING THE 
PRESSURE JUST BLUE AND PINK NEEDED 
THAT BREAK TAKES IN THREE FRAMES IN 
FRONT TAKES HIM 
JOE PERRY IS NOW BEGINNING TO FEEL 
LIKE HE HAS BEEN MUGGED BY STUART 
BINGHAM ANOTHER ONE SLIPS FROM HIS 
GRASP INTO THE LAST OF THE SESSION 
WE GO 
THAT WAS A CRACKING SHOT WASN'T 
IT JUST LOST THE WHITE SLIGHTLY 
PINK OR BLACK ON IF HE PLAYS THE 
BLACK HE WILL HAVE TO PLAY THE 
CANNON JUST TOO SLOW IT THE WHITE 
DOWN RUNNING BEHIND THE BLACK IS 
NOT AN OPTION FOR ME HE HAS GOT TO 
TAKE THE POT ON 
D. ANY REASON HE TURNED DOWN IS 
BECAUSE HE IS FIVE TO TWO IN FRONT HE HAS 
TENDED DOWN 
HE HAS PUT THE BLACK OUT OF 
COMMISSION HE KNOWS HIS OPPONENT 
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND 
NOT WANTING TO GIVE HIM AN EASY 
STARTER BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE 
JUST GOT TO GRAB IT 
I KNOW WHAT 
YOU'RE SAYING IN HINDSIGHT HE 
COULD GO ONE TO WIN THE FRAME WITH 
THE NEXT SHOT BUT THIS IS TOUGH 
WHAT KENT JOE PERRY DO HERE WHAT 
CAN JOE PERRY DID HE 
IS THERE ANYTHING AVAILABLE IN THE 
MIDDLE A COUPLE OF KISS IS THERE 
I AM NOT TOO SURE THE ONE NEAREST 
THE PINK SPOT WILL POT 
IT DOESN'T THIS IS THE ONE I 
THOUGHT WOULD POT IT IS NOT ON 
IF STUART PLAYS THE POT HE ONLY 
HAS THE SAFETY SHOT TO PLAY 
IT IS A TEMPTER FOR JOE IF YOU ARE 
FIVE TO TWO IN FRONT IT WOULD BE TRICKY 
FIVE TO TWO BEHIND IT IS NOT NICE 
WELL DONE THE ONLY THING IN HIS 
FAVOUR THERE IS THAT HE WAS FORCED 
TO GO FOR THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE 
ANOTHER SHOT ON THE WAY HE HAS 
LOOKED AT THE LAST TEN MINUTES OR SO 
YOU WOULDN'T FANCY JOE PERRY TO 
MAKE THAT RED BUT ALL CREDIT TO 
HIM 
LOADS OF REDS ABOUT BUT THE 
COLOURS ARE BIT MIXED UP 
I'M NOT TOO SURE WHETHER JOE HAD 
THAT LAST RED AS CLEANLY AS HE 
WOULD LIKE TO 
HE'S USED RED IN THE WORLD HE HIT 
THE CHORES THREE TIMES HE'S USED 
TO READ IN THE WORLD 
HIS BODY JIMMY KNAPP DEBBIE KNAP 
SAYS THAT EVERYTHING IS ON HIS 
SHOULDERS HIS BODY DEMEANOUR 
THINGS ARE NOT GOING THAT WRONG 
JOE YOU ARE HAVING CHANCES 
GOOD RECOVERY THAT SOMETIMES YOU 
GO DOWN ON A SHOT LIKE THAT AND 
THINK IT IS A TRICKY ONE BUT HE 
HAS GOT BACK IN PRIME POSITION NOW 
HE HAS GOT THE WAY HE WANTS THEM 
NOW THIS IS A PRACTICE SITUATION 
HE WOULD BE DELIGHTED WITH FIVE TO 
THREE 
WELL I WOULDN'T SAY THAT BUT I 
KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
THE WAY THE 
MATCH HAS GONE HE HAS BEEN HANGING 
ON TO WIN THREE FRAMES WHEN YOU'RE 
NOT FEELING AT YOUR BEST IT IS A 
GOOD PERFORMANCE SOMETIMES 
HE MAY 
HAVE THOUGHT THAT EARLIER ON IN 
THIS FRAME WHEN IT STUART BINGHAM 
NOT A GREAT LONG ALREADY IN JOE 
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE WOULD CLEAR 
THEM UP BUT HE TURNED THAT DOWN 
IN THE MEANTIME HE HAS LOST THE 
NEXT SAFETY BATTLE WITH JOE STILL 
DOING WELL HERE 
PLENTY OF EASIER RED STICK IT ON 
RED'S TO GET ON HAVE TO WATCH THE 
CUE BALL MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T STEP 
OUT OF CONTROL 
IT IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE 
DIFFICULT THE FURTHER HE GOES ALONG 
A LOT OF THE COLOURS DOWN THAT SIDE 
OF THE TABLE SEEMED TO BE COVERING 
EACH OTHER L. DON'T THINK THE VOTE 
GOES PAST THE RED ON THE LEFT ALL 
THE BROWN I DON'T THINK THE 
YELLOW 
NOT SHORT HE PLAYED FOR THEN BUT 
YOU CERTAINLY NOT ON THE YELLOW 
NOT SURE WHAT HE PLAYED FOR THEM 
BUT HE IS CERTAINLY NOT ON THE 
YELLOW YOU CAN GET IN A FRAME OF 
MIND SOMETIMES WHEN THE REDS AROUND 
THIS SORT OF POSITION JUST TRYING 
TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING AND TRYING 
TO BE A LITTLE TOO CAREFUL WHICH 
IS UNDERSTANDABLE THE WAY THIS 
SESSION HAS GONE FROM JOE PERRY'S 
POINTED YOU POINT OF VIEW 
THIS IS HIS FIRST MINI CRISIS IN 
THIS BREAK OUT OF THE WAY 
NO NEED THERE TO BRING THE 
DIFFICULT RED INTO PLAY COULD COME 
A LITTLE AWKWARD HERE PLAYED FOR 
BLACK MADE TAKE THE MORE DIFFICULT 
BROWN ALE MAY TAKE THE MORE 
DIFFICULT BROWN NOW ALL OF A 
SUDDEN FROM A STRAIGHT FOR 
POSITION HE IS FACED WITH A DEGREE 
OF DIFFICULTY 
VERY WELL DONE HE HAS RETAINED 
POSITION 
THAT SHOULD PUT ANY DOUBT OUT OF 
THE WAY FOR JOE PERRY IN THIS FRAME 
THIS HAS BEEN A VERY GOOD EFFORT 
YOU MAY THINK THEY WERE ALL ON BUT 
WHEN YOU ARE OUT THERE UNDER THE 
PRESSURE HE IS UNDER HE HAS DONE 
WELL 
BINGHAM WILL BE A LITTLE BIT 
DISAPPOINTED BUT I DON'T THINK FIVE TO THREE 
IT IS TO BACK FROM HIS POINT OF 
VIEW STUART CONCEDES OVERNIGHT JOE PERRY TRAILS FIVE TO THREE 
A OF THE CHEEKS FROM JOE PERRY 
THE RAIN IS PUTTING DOWN HIT IN 
SHEFFIELD WE HAVE HAD THUNDER 
DESCRIBE HOW THE MATCH CAN COULD 
CARRY ON 
JOE PERRY WALKED OFF IT 
WAS A TOUGH SESSION FOR HIM STUART 
BINGHAM WILL BE PLEASED YOU HAVE 
TO SCRAPE JOE PERRY OFF THE TABLE 
TO BEAT HIM 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 
MAKE A RUN FOR IT 
THIS MATCH IS 
PREDICTABLY UNBRIDGEABLE 
WELL SAID 
RAY IS BACK TONIGHT AT SEVEN P. M. 
THANKS TO STEVE AND JOHN FOR THEIR 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP PERSPECTIVE WE 
WILL REVIEW WITH MEMORIES FROM A 
VERY DAPPER IRISHMAN
