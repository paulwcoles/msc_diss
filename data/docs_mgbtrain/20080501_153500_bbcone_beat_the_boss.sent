THAT'S IT THE BATTERY'S GONE 
I HAVE THE RESULT RIGHT HERE IN MY HAND 
I'M SAIRA KHAN AND THIS IS BEAT THE BOSS 
WHERE THREE BRIGHT SPARKS COMPETE AGAINST THREE BIG SHOTS 
TO CREATE A BRAND NEW PRODUCT FOR THE CHILDREN'S MARKET 
THE QUESTION IS WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT 
CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES COME ON 
A BIRTHDAY PARTY ISN'T A PARTY WITHOUT A CAKE 
CHOCOLATE SPONGE OR FRUIT WE ALL LOVE A PIECE 
BUT WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE CAKE 
TO MAKE THAT CELEBRATION GO WITH A BANG 
AIMING TO WIN THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY ARE OUR THREE BRIGHT SPARKS

AND WANTS TO SKATE TO VICTORY 
I MIGHT STILL BE AT SCHOOL BUT I CAN TEACH YOU A THING OR TWO 
THEY'RE UP AGAINST THE BIG SHOTS 
THEY'RE ALEX LAURA AND WILL 
FIRST MULTI AWARD WINNER ALEX 
HE RUNS A DESIGNER SHOPPING WEBSITE 
QUITE FRANKLY YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CHANCE 
MEET LAURA MANAGING DIRECTOR OF A CHAIN OF SPECIALIST BABYWEAR SHOPS 
BEWARE BRIGHT SPARKS WE'RE THE PROFESSIONALS 
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A REALLY TOUGH TIME 
FINALLY ENTREPRENEUR WILL 
HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF A SPORTS PRODUCT COMPANY 
THE GAME'S UP BEFORE IT'S EVEN BEGUN IT'S TIME TO GO HOME 
THAT'S OUR TEAMS THE BIG SHOTS 
WITH OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCE 
AND THE BRIGHT SPARKS WHO HAVE THE INSIDER KNOWLEDGE ON WHAT YOU LIKE 
IT'S TIME TO DELIVER THE BRIEF 
OH HELLO 
HI I'VE GOT THE BRIEF 
CAN I COME IN YEAH COME ON 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS 
THE BIG SHOTS MIGHT START CRYING WHEN WE BEAT THEM 
OOH FIGHTING TALK ALREADY ARE YOU READY TO RECEIVE YOUR BRIEF 
YES 
BRING IT ON 
THIS IS ONE TASTY CHALLENGE 
OH NO 
YOU TEAM MUST COOK UP THE ULTIMATE BIRTHDAY CAKE 
OH MY GOSH MY WORST NIGHTMARE HAS COME TRUE NOW 
OH YES 
YOUR CAKE MUST BE A UNIQUE SHAPE AND FLAVOUR 
AND ITS SPECIAL PACKAGING MUST HAVE A BIRTHDAY SURPRISE 
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE THE TOUGHEST CHALLENGE OF MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER 
WE'RE YOUNG WE STILL HAVE CAKES 
THEY DON'T THEY'RE ALL OLD AND GREY 
THIS IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE HOW ON EARTH DO YOU GET A UNIQUE TASTE 
BOTH TEAMS HAVE BEEN SENT TO GET A SERVING OF MARKET RESEARCH 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE HEADING TO THE U. K.'S LARGEST CAKE FAIR 
AND THE BIG SHOTS ARE GETTING A TASTER OF WHAT YOU LIKE 
FROM A CAKE MAKING EXPERT 
THEY'LL HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT 
BRITAIN HAS ONE SERIOUS SWEET TOOTH 
WE SPEND OVER ONE POINT TWO BILLION ON CAKES AND PASTRIES A YEAR 
HAVE OUR TEAMS GOT THE APPETITE 
TO TAKE A BITE OUT OF THIS COMPETITIVE MARKET 
I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING 
SLIGHTLY MORE VIBRANT SOMETHING THAT ISN'T A FIGURE 
THESE ARE MORE LOOK NICE FANCY TYPE THINGS 
THESE ARE LIKE FANCY CAKES 
WHAT ARE THE BEST THINGS YOU'D USE TO DECORATE A CAKE 
FOR A GIRL YOU COULD GO WITH SOMETHING VERY NICE 
LIKE MAYBE A LITTLE FLOWER 
AND FOR THE BOYS MAYBE YOU COULD DO FOOTBALL BOOTS 
WE HAVE AN IDEA FOR A DO IT YOURSELF TYPE CAKE 
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO DO THIS 
IN A DO IT YOURSELF KIT 
YOU USE THREE BASIC STEPS AND IT WAS A ROUND BALL AND IT WAS A PEAR 
AND THEN YOU CAN USE A SAUSAGE AS WELL 
AS THE BRIGHT SPARKS EXPLORE THEIR DIY CAKE IDEA 
THE BIG SHOTS ARE FINDING OUT THE BASIC INGREDIENTS OF WHAT YOU LIKE 
WITH CAKE EXPERT CAROLYN 
EVERY CHILD HAS A DIFFERENT IDEA OF WHAT THEIR ULTIMATE BIRTHDAY CAKE IS 
YOU'VE GOT KIDS THAT LIKE MUSIC THAT LIKE SPORT 
THAT LIKE HOBBIES AND GAMEBOYS 
AND YOU REALLY HAVE GOT AN OPEN BOOK 
ARE THERE ANY THINGS THAT YOU KNOW ALL KIDS LIKE 
DEFINITELY LOVE CHOCOLATE DO YOU DO ANY UNUSUAL FLAVOURS 
OR DO THEY TEND TO BE MOSTLY SPONGE 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO UNUSUAL FLAVOURS 
WE'D PROBABLY DO THINGS LIKE BUTTERSCOTCH OR WE'D DO CARAMEL 
WE'D DO CHOCOLATE CHIP STRAWBERRY THOSE ARE THE MORE UNUSUAL ONES 
I HAVE GOT SOME CONCERNS THAT THE OTHER TEAM 
ARE GONNA HAVE INSIDE KNOWLEDGE BEING KIDS THEMSELVES 
WE'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM AN ADULT'S PERSPECTIVE 
AND WE NEED TO GET INTO A KID'S MINDSET 
AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE 
HAVING COMPLETED THEIR MARKET RESEARCH AT THE CAKE SHOW 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE HOPING TO GET SOME PACKAGING IDEAS 
BY VISITING BOXER A LEADING DESIGN AGENCY 
PACKAGING IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF A PRODUCT 
IF YOU DON'T GIVE A GOOD IMPRESSION WITH THE PACKAGING 
THEN THE PRODUCT WON'T SELL 
WHICH COLOURS AND WHICH SHAPES DO YOU THINK WILL SCREAM BIRTHDAY 
YOU'VE GOT THESE BOOKS HERE YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH 
WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS 
YOU WANT PROBABLY BOLD BRIGHT COLOURS THAT ARE ATTRACTIVE 
THE BIG THING IS STANDOUT 
IF YOU CAN GET SOMEONE TO PICK UP A PRODUCT 
THE STATS ARE ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE TO EIGHTY PER CENT THAT PEOPLE WILL THEN BUY IT 
I'M VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT BEATING THE BIG SHOTS 
BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE GOT GREAT IDEAS 
I THINK WE COULD WIN THEN 
HANDS FULL OF CAKE THE BIG SHOTS ARE ACCEPTING AN INVITE TO A PARTY 
TO DO A TASTE TEST WITH SOME OF YOU 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU 
WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT THE CAKE ICING 
IT'S REALLY SWEET IT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO SWEET THOUGH 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE CHOCOLATE CAKE IT'S REALLY NICE 
BUT THE ICING IS A BIT TOO HARD SO YOU HAVE TO BITE INTO IT 
WHAT KIND OF CONCEPT AROUND CAKE WOULD YOU GO FOR 
WHAT KIND OF SHAPE 
YOU SHOULD MAKE CAKES THAT EVERYONE COULD LIKE 
LIKE THE CATERPILLAR CAKE EXCEPT THAT WOULD BE BAD 
BECAUSE THERE'S A FACE AND THERE'S FEET 
AND YOU'D BE ARGUING OVER WHO GETS WHAT 
DO YOU THINK ANY OF THESE PACKAGINGS ARE INTERESTING ENOUGH FOR YOU 
YEAH WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE BEST YOU LIKE THAT ONE 
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE BUT IT'S NICE NOW WE'VE DONE THE MARKET RESEARCH 
WE'RE REALLY EQUIPPED TO CREATE A CRACKER OF A CAKE 
I THINK WE'VE CONFIRMED OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT KIDS WANT 
SO WE'RE READY TO GO WOW 
LET'S HOPE OUR TEAMS CAN RISE TO THE CHALLENGE 
IT'S TIME FOR THE BRAINSTORM 
I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF THIS VOLCANO 
YOU PUT IT ON THE TABLE ALL THE CHOCOLATE OOZES DOWN THE SIDES 
YEAH DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE A BIG BROWN BLOB 
IT WOULD BE FUN BECAUSE WHEN IT WAS THE VOLCANO ALL POURING DOWN 
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT SUITABLE FOR BOYS AND GIRLS 
IF YOU WENT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS RACING CAR 
WHICH WOULDN'T JUST BE RACING CARS 
YOU'D HAVE YOUR PINK VESPA A PINK CADILLAC O. K. 
WE'D HAVE TO MAKE IT SO THE GIRLS LIKE IT AS MUCH AS THE BOYS EXACTLY 
MY ONLY CONCERN WITH IT IS IS IT A BIT TOO BORING 
WITH THE BIG SHOTS STUCK ON TWO IDEAS 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS CAN'T WORK OUT THEIR DIY CAKE IDEA 
ON THE BASE YOU'VE JUST GOT PLAIN SPONGE 
AND THEN ON TOP 
YOU'VE GOT TWO LAYERS ONE IS PLAIN SPICE 
THE OTHER ONE'S A MARBLED EFFECT 
AND THEN SOMETHING ON TOP YEAH THAT'S LIKE THAT IDEA THEN 
WE WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENT ONE OH DEAR HERE COMES TROUBLE 
HERE COMES TROUBLE I'VE JUST HEARD YOU'RE IN TROUBLE 
WHY AM I SEEING THREE SEPARATE DRAWINGS 
SHOW ME A DRAWING OF THE SHAPE OF YOUR CAKE 
THERE AND THERE THAT IS YOUR CAKE SO FAR 
A TINY LITTLE STAR AND THREE CIRCLES 
RICHARD CAN I HAVE YOUR PAD PLEASE 
ISABEL CAN I HAVE YOUR PAD PLEASE 
O. K. 
I'M GONNA TAKE THESE TWO THINGS AWAY 
GET BACK TO THE BRIEF 
YOU HAVE NOT GOT LONG TO GET THIS DOWN ON PAPER COME ON THEN 
SHE WAS KIND OF HARSH 
BUT SHE'S OBVIOUSLY A PROFESSIONAL SO SHE'LL KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING 
AS THE BRIGHT SPARKS FINALLY WORK AS ONE 
THE BIG SHOTS STILL CAN'T AGREE ON WHICH DESIGN THEY WANT 
WHAT SHAPE WOULD IT BE IT WOULD BE A VOLCANO O. K. 
AND OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GOT YOUR IDEA LAURA 
YEAH WHICH ONE WOULD YOU GO FOR 
THE VOLCANO IDEA I'M NOT CONVINCED ON THE CAR IDEA 
I THINK SOME SPECTACULAR VOLCANO MAYBE USING SPARKLING CANDLES 
SOMETHING THAT'S GOT THE WOW FACTOR TO IT WHEN IT'S OPENED UP 
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE A BIG CHRISTMAS PUDDING 
IT SOUNDS DELICIOUS BUT IS IT THE ULTIMATE BIRTHDAY CAKE 
BUT LAURA THE THING IS 
IT'S UP TO YOU NOT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A BIG BROWN PUDDING 
WE WERE FAFFING AROUND A BIT WITH VARIOUS DIFFERENT IDEAS 
AND WE NEEDED TO HONE IT IN AND REALLY DECIDE ON ONE IDEA 
SO WE'VE DONE THAT 
WHILE THE BIG SHOTS GO TO WORK ON THEIR VOLCANO IDEA 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE THINKING ABOUT THEIR PACKAGING 
WHICH COLOUR ARE WE GOING TO DO IT THOUGH 
SHALL WE DO IT METALLICALLY COLOURED OR HOLOGRAM 
HOLOGRAM FROM ONE END IT LOOKS YELLOW 
AND AS YOU GET CLOSER AND CLOSER IT'S MORE GREENY 
AND AS YOU GO PAST IT IT'S GREEN 
AND AS YOU GO PAST IT IT GETS MORE BLUEY O. K. BRIGHT SPARKS 
YOUR TIME IS UP 
RICHARD CAN YOU PLEASE PRESENT YOUR FINAL IDEA TO ME 
WE'VE GOT THE CAKE WITH A STAR AND NINE CIRCLES AROUND IT 
WHAT'S YOUR UNIQUE FLAVOUR 
MILKSHAKE FLAVOUR 
LET'S JUST WORK THIS THROUGH 
IF I SAY TO YOU RICHARD CAN I HAVE A MILKSHAKE 
AND YOU OWN A MILKSHAKE SHOP 
WHAT'S YOUR NEXT QUESTION TO ME GOING TO BE 
I SUPPOSE WHAT FLAVOUR MILKSHAKE 
BUT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ISN'T THERE JUST A PLAIN MILKSHAKE FLAVOUR 
WHAT WOULD THAT BE 
I DON'T KNOW JUST SORT OF MILK SO WOULD IT BE MILK YEAH MILK 
ISN'T THAT JUST CALLED MILK THOUGH 
AND FINALLY WHAT IS THE NAME OF YOUR CAKE 
SHOUT OUT CAKE KIT 
SHOUT OUT CAKE KIT SOCK 
OH I GET IT 
S. SHOUT OUT CAKE KIT WE'VE WORKED ON THAT 
AND FOR SOMEONE JUST TO CALL IT A SOCK AIN'T VERY NICE 
WHY DON'T WE GO BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL IDEA 
OF HAVING THE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN 
AND HAVE A MECHANISED FOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAKE 
YOU COULD EASILY BUY A MECHANISED FOUNTAIN 
AND BUILD A CAKE AROUND THAT 
IS THAT GIVING AWAY THE SURPRISE 
BIG SHOTS YOUR TIME IS UP 
ALEX CAN YOU PLEASE PRESENT YOUR FINAL IDEA TO ME CERTAINLY 
WE'VE GONE FOR THE INCREDIBLE EXPLODING CHOCOLATE LAKE CAKE 
IT'S A UNIQUE SHAPE 
IT'S BASICALLY A CHOCOLATE FONDUE FOUNTAIN 
WITH A VOLCANO SHAPED CAKE WRAPPED AROUND IT 
WHAT IS THE UNIQUE FLAVOUR OF YOUR CAKE 
I'M TEMPTED TO JUST GO CRAZY AND GO WITH THE CHILLI CHOCOLATE 
SO CAN YOU NOW PLEASE TELL ME ABOUT YOUR PACKAGING 
GIVE US ONE MINUTE ON THE PACKAGING PACKAGING GUYS 
IT'S GOING TO BE IN A BOX NO NO EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME 
YOUR TIME IS UP 
YEAH O. K. WHO'S GOING TO ANSWER THIS 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A CARDBOARD PACKAGING WITH A TWIST 
TO REPLICATE THE TWIST OF THE VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN 
YOU'VE NOW GOT TO PITCH YOUR CAKE 
TO THE GLOBAL LEADER IN CELEBRATION CAKES 
YOU MUST BE CONCRETE IN THE DETAILS OF YOUR CAKE 
I THINK YOU'VE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB 
I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR PITCH 
BUT HOPEFULLY YOU'LL GET THROUGH THAT 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT OUR PITCH WE'RE PITCH EXPERTS 
AND IN PREPARATION FOR THE PITCHES 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS HAVE WORKED UP THEIR IDEA 
INTO A VARIETY OF MULTI COLOURED CAKES 
WITH DIFFERENT FLAVOURS INCLUDING SWEETS TO CUSTOMISE IT 
THEY'VE ALSO PUT TOGETHER A COLOURFUL PRESENTATION 
WHILE THE BIG SHOTS HAVE STUCK WITH THEIR VOLCANO SHAPED CAKE 
BUILT AROUND A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN 
AND PUT TOGETHER PROFESSIONAL DRAWINGS TO SELL THE IDEA 
AND BOTH TEAMS HAVE INCLUDED SOUND EFFECTS IN THEIR PACKAGING 
BUT ONLY ONE TEAM CAN WIN THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY 
SO THE PRESSURE'S ON AS THEY MEET FOR THE FIRST TIME AT LIGHTBODY 
THE GLOBAL LEADER IN CELEBRATION CAKES 
WHERE THEY'LL BE PITCHING TO JO FRASER AND DARYL NEWLANDS 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE BRIGHT SPARKS 
IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THEIR IDEAS ARE FOR THE CAKE 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING THE BIG SHOTS 
BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE IF THEY'RE AS CONFIDENT AS US 
HAVE YOU BEEN A BIT SCARED NO ARE YOU NERVOUS 
NO WE'RE NOT NERVOUS WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE THOUGH 
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE 
JO TOSSES A COIN TO SEE WHO'LL PITCH FIRST 
WITH THE BIG SHOTS CALLING TAILS TAILS IT IS 
WHAT CAN I SAY WINNERS ALREADY 
AND DECIDE TO PITCH FIRST 
WE TOOK THE TRADITIONAL STACKED CAKE 
COMBINED IT WITH A CHOCOLATE FONDUE FOUNTAIN 
AND CREATED OUR AMAZING EXPLOSIVE CHOCOLATE LAKE CAKE 
WE THOUGHT THAT A JUNGLE THEME WOULD WORK WELL FOR BOYS AND GIRLS 
THE CHOCOLATE CAKE THEN HAS A DELICIOUS WITH SECRET INGREDIENT 
CHOCOLATE RIVER FLOWING DOWN THE SIDES OF THE CAKE 
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW OUR SECRET INGREDIENT AT THIS POINT 
I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THIS IS CHILLI CHOCOLATE 
YOU WILL FIND EQUALLY AS MANY CHILDREN WHO DON'T FANCY CHILLI FLAVOUR AS WHO DO 
WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULDN'T ADVERTISE THAT IT'S CHILLI CHOCOLATE 
BECAUSE WE THINK CHILLI IS A WORD 
WHICH WILL ACTUALLY PUT MOST CHILDREN OFF 
SO WE CALL IT WITH A SPARKY SPECIAL FLAVOUR 
AS THE BIG SHOTS CONTINUE THEIR PITCH 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE IN CRISIS 
THE LAPTOP CONTAINING THEIR PRESENTATION HAS RUN OUT OF POWER 
AND THE LAPTOP'S GONE CAN'T USE THAT NOW WITH NO BACK UP 
THEY WRITE OUT WHAT THEY CAN REMEMBER OF THEIR PITCH 
THIS COULD BE IF WE FOUND THAT THE ENGINEERING POSITION 
WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO COMPLICATED A MINI SPARKLER INSIDE THE PACKET 
WHICH COULD THEN BE GIVEN TO THE CHILDREN 
IT MIGHT BE THE NICE SURPRISE ELEMENT 
I THINK IT SOUNDS REALLY REALLY FUN 
SLIGHTLY WORRIED ABOUT SOME OF THE ELECTRONIC ELEMENTS TO THE CAKE 
GIVEN THAT IN A FACTORY AND A PRODUCTION LINE 
WE ULTIMATELY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A METAL DETECTOR 
I WANT YOU TO WORK WITH OUR DESIGNERS THIS AFTERNOON 
WE'VE GOT OUR BEST CREATIVE PEOPLE FOR YOU 
MAKE SURE YOU DO MENTION CHILLI ON THE PACKAGING 
BECAUSE IN TERMS OF THE INGREDIENTS 
YOU'LL HAVE TO PUT THAT ACROSS ANYWAY 
NEXT UP IT'S THE BRIGHT SPARKS WITH THEIR SHOUT OUT CAKE KIT 
IT'S IN A BOX HOLOGRAPHIC PATTERN IT HAS TWO TRAYS 
AROUND THE PACKAGING ITSELF IT'S GOING TO HAVE LOTS OF RIBBONS 
AND IT'S GOING TO BE BRIGHT SO IT CAN BE EYE CATCHING AS WELL 
IN TRAY ONE THERE ARE NINE SMALL CAKES SURROUNDING THE BIG CAKE 
EACH ONE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT FLAVOURS 
THE CAKE IN THE MIDDLE WILL BE A STAR SHAPE 
SO DIFFERENT POINTY BITS OF THE STAR 
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FLAVOURS AND DIFFERENT COLOURS 
I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED 
BECAUSE THE LAPTOP RAN OUT OF BATTERY JUST BEFORE WE WENT IN 
BUT IT SHOWED HOW WE COULD PULL THROUGH AS A TEAM WITHOUT IT 
IN TRAY TWO MATERIALS TO DECORATE 
SPRINKLES MARZIPAN ICING SMARTIES AND CHOCOLATE 
IT SOUNDS GREAT FUN 
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHAT SORT OF DECORATIONS 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AND DON'T OVER COMPLICATE IT O. K. 
APART FROM THAT IT SOUNDS QUITE FUN THE BRIGHT SPARKS' PRESENTATION 
IT WAS A SHAME THE LAPTOP WASN'T WORKING 
WHICH JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU NEED TO PREPARE PREPARE PREPARE 
NO MATTER WHAT AGE YOU ARE 
BUT I THOUGHT THEY CARRIED IT OFF 
THEY MANAGED TO DESCRIBE THEIR IDEA QUITE WELL 
BOTH TEAMS NOW GET TO WORK ON THEIR IDEAS 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE WORKING WITH CRAIG ON THE PACKAGING 
AND WITH CHILLI FLAVOUR DROPPED IN FAVOUR OF ALL OUT CHOCOLATE 
THE BIG SHOTS ARE WORKING WITH DESIGNER DAVID 
I'VE WORKED ON THIS IDEA RATHER THAN THE VOLCANO EXPLODING 
WE'VE GOT A HOLLOW PIECE OF CHOCOLATE 
INSIDE THIS I HAVE RASPBERRY JAM 
MAYBE WITH THIS POPPING CANDY THAT YOU CAN TASTE 
AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF THAT 
BUT THE KIDS WILL TAKE A HAMMER AND CRACK THIS 
AND HOPEFULLY THE JAM WILL FLOW DOWN OVER THE CAKE 
AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE AN ERUPTING VOLCANO 
THAT'S COOL YEAH I LIKE THAT WHAT DO YOU THINK DISASTER 
IT'S LIKE RUINED OUR WHOLE PLAN 
WE NEED THE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN INSIDE THE CAKE 
COS THE CAKE'S GOT TO BE INTERACTIVE SO 
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN 
IS IT JUST THAT YOU'RE NOT USED TO WORKING WITH THAT KIND OF 
I DON'T THINK IT'S PRACTICAL TO HAVE A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN 
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING A PRACTICAL CAKE 
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DESIGNING THE ULTIMATE CAKE 
THEIR IDEAL WAS A CAKE THAT WAS A FULL CIRCLE 
AND THAT THE FOUNTAIN WOULD SIT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT 
THAT JUST WASN'T PRACTICAL 
BECAUSE OF THE FLEX COMING OUT THE BACK OF THE FOUNTAIN IDEA 
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS INSTEAD OF DESIGNING A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREE CAKE 
IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DEGREES 
WITH A GAP AT THE BACK SO THAT YOU CAN PUT THE MACHINE IN 
MEANWHILE THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE CHOOSING THE MATERIAL FOR THEIR BOX 
THIS IS A SELECTION OF DIFFERENT METALLIC AND HOLOGRAPHIC BOARDS 
THAT WE'VE GOT HERE 
THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT STYLES 
THIS ONE HERE IS LIKE A C. D. 
OH THAT ONE'S GOOD THAT'S A KIND OF PEARL THAT CHANGES IN COLOUR 
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL METALLIC BASED THEY'RE ALL FAIRLY BRIGHT ANYWAY 
AND I THINK THEY'RE THE ONES THAT WILL CHANGE THE MOST IN COLOUR 
I LIKE THAT ONE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A RAINBOW 
WITH A COMPROMISE REACHED OVER SAFETY 
THE BIG SHOTS ARE BACK AT WORK WITH DAVID ON THE LOOK OF THEIR CAKE 
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT MONKEYS AND HIPPOS 
THIS IS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE WORKED ON ALREADY 
I THINK THAT'S BRILLIANT 
I THINK WE'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR BOYS AND GIRLS 
WITH THE PINK HIPPOS FOR GIRLS AND THE CHEEKY MONKEYS FOR BOYS 
WHILE THE BIG SHOTS WORK ON THEIR PACKAGING 
DAVID IS BACK IN THE KITCHEN WITH THE BRIGHT SPARKS 
I KNOW IN YOUR CAKE DESIGN 
YOU'VE ASKED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT FLAVOURS AND SHAPES 
THE FLAVOURS I CAN DO 
I CAN WORK ON DIFFERENT FLAVOURS FOR EACH OF YOUR DESIGNS 
BUT I MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM MAKING ALL YOUR DIFFERENT SHAPES 
AND CUPCAKES BECAUSE I NEED TO STICK TO A ROUND BASE 
BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY HAVE ALL YOUR DIFFERENT COLOURS 
AND ALL YOUR DIFFERENT FLAVOURS THAT'S GOOD 
THE IDEA WAS THAT IT WOULD BE THE SPONGE 
THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FLAVOURS 
AND THEN YOU WOULD ICE THEM 
IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE DIFFICULT 
TO GET ALL THE SPONGES DIFFERENT FLAVOURS 
BECAUSE I NEED TO TRY AND GET BAKE STABLE FLAVOURS 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU BAKE THE CAKE THE FLAVOUR CHANGES 
TO TRY AND SOURCE ALL THAT IN ALL YOUR NINE DIFFERENT FLAVOURS 
IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT 
WITH BOTH TEAMS HAVING TO MAKE CHANGES TO THEIR CAKES 
WHAT DOES DAVID THINK AT THE END OF THE COMPANY DAY 
I THINK THE KIDS WILL ENJOY BOTH CAKES 
I THINK THEY'LL ENJOY DECORATING THE ELEMENTS OF THE KIDS' DESIGN 
BUT I THINK THEY'LL LOVE THE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN 
SO OUT OF THE TWO I THINK MAYBE THE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN WILL WIN IT 
BUT IT'S NOT DOWN TO DAVID THAT'S THE JOB OF OUR TWENTY FIVE EXPERT JUDGES 
THE PRODUCTS HAVE NOW BEEN MADE 
SO IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHO'S WON THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY 
IT'S DECISION DAY 
BOTH OUR TEAMS ARE AT THE BEAT THE BOSS HEADQUARTERS TO GET THE RESULT 
WE'VE BEEN STICKING TO OUR GUNS IN THIS COMPETITION 
AND THE DESIGN THAT WE CAME UP WITH ORIGINALLY 
THE BRIEF WAS TO BE THE WORLD'S MOST AMAZING CAKE 
WE'LL SEE THE PRODUCT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD 
I'M FEELING A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS BUT VERY EXCITED 
NOT BEING IN CONTROL OF THE PROJECT FROM START TO FINISH 
REALLY HAS BEEN QUITE DAUNTING 
I AM USED TO OVERSEEING EVERY LITTLE PROJECT FROM START TO FINISH 
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO WIN IT'S EASY 
BECAUSE THEIR CAKE IS CRUMMY 
FINAL MESSAGE TO THE BRIGHT SPARKS IS 
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU 
BUT BEATING YOU IS GONNA BE A PIECE OF CAKE 
MY MESSAGE TO THE BIG SHOTS IS I HOPE YOU'VE GOT YOUR BUS FARE 
HI 
GO SLOWLY ON THE RED CARPET 
ENJOY IT COS YOU'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER CHANCE 
GUYS CAN YOU SMELL SOMETHING IT'S YOU YOU LEFT THE OVEN ON 
IT SMELLS LIKE VICTORY TO ME OURS BURNED CAKE 
CAN YOU ALL SHUT YOUR CAKEHOLES 
I'LL TELL YOU WHO'S GOING HOME IN THE LIMOUSINE LATER 
WELCOME TO THE BEAT THE BOSS BOARDROOM 
TODAY FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME YOU'RE GOING TO SEE YOUR PRODUCTS 
CAN YOU WALK THIS WAY 
O. K. WELL LET'S SEE THE AMAZING EXPLODING CHOCOLATE LAKE CAKE 
OH THAT'S WONDERFUL THAT'S INCREDIBLE THAT IS FANTASTIC 
LAURA CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE SPARKLERS 
THEY'RE BIRTHDAY CAKE CANDLES 
BUT THEY'RE LITTLE INDOOR FIREWORKS 
AS YOU LIGHT THEM IT'S LIKE THE TOP OF THE VOLCANO EXPLODING 
SO IT TIES IN WITH THE THEME ESPECIALLY WITH THE JUNGLE SOUNDS 
WHICH WILL JUST MAKE IT THE MOST INCREDIBLE INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE 
THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB IN BRINGING MONKEYS AND HIPPOS 
AND BANANAS AND ALL OF THESE THINGS 
CAN BE DIPPED INTO THE CHOCOLATE FONDUE FOUNTAIN WHEN IT'S IN PLACE 
NOW LAURA TO COMPLETE THIS CAKE YOU DO NEED A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN 
IT DOESN'T COME WITH THE CAKE IS THAT A DISADVANTAGE NO NO 
BECAUSE SO MANY KIDS THESE DAYS HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN 
IT'S GOING TO BE A NEW INTERACTIVE CAKE 
WHICH NO ONE WILL HAVE SEEN BEFORE AT A BIRTHDAY PARTY 
I'M GOING TO ASK THE BRIGHT SPARKS WHAT THEY THINK 
THE PACKAGING'S GOOD I'LL HAND YOU THAT 
BUT WHAT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE FONDUE FOUNTAIN 
HAVE ANY OF YOU GOT A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN AT HOME NO 
NONE OF THEM HAVE GOT A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN ARE YOU WORRIED 
NO MUMS WILL DO ANYTHING TO KEEP CHILDREN HAPPY 
FIFTEEN FOR A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN NO WORRIES 
ARE YOU READY TO SEE THE SOCK CAKE 
YEP SHOUT OUT CAKE KIT THAT'S THE ONE HERE WE GO 
THERE YOU GO 
THAT'S AMAZING 
O. K. WE'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL BOW HERE WHICH WE CAN TAKE OFF 
DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR SPECIAL PACKAGING 
IT'S HOLOGRAPHIC SO YOU CAN SEE ALL SORTS OF COLOURS 
ARE YOU READY HERE WE GO WOW THAT LOOKS GREAT 
THESE THEN FOLD TO THE SIDES 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS AMAZING 
THAT IS MORE THAN AMAZING THAT IS OUT OF THIS WORLD 
HERE WE HAVE STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE 
WITH AN ORANGE FLAVOURING AS WELL 
BLUEBERRY APPLE AND LEMON 
AND THEN THE ONES AROUND THE OUTSIDE 
ARE DIFFERENT MIXES UP OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FLAVOURS 
THERE'S ICING SWEETS 
AND A COMBINATION OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS 
THAT YOU CAN DECORATE YOUR CAKE WITH 
SO REALLY IT'S TWO CAKES IN ONE 
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR SPECIAL FEATURE 
THE PARENTS THEY CAN RECORD A MESSAGE TO WHOEVER IS THE BIRTHDAY 
O. K. SO LET'S SEE WE HOPE YOU HAVE FUN DECORATING YOUR CAKES 
AND TRYING THE FANTASTIC FLAVOURED TOPPINGS' 
SO RICHARD ARE YOU PLEASED WITH IT 
I AM OVER THE MOON 
I THINK WE MIGHT ACTUALLY WIN THIS THING 
BIG SHOTS WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE SHOUT OUT CAKE 
IT'S NOT UP TO SCRATCH 
WHAT DO YOU THINK GUYS I DON'T KNOW 
THAT TRAY OF SWEETS IS ALL VERY GOOD FOR BRIBING THE JUDGES 
WELL I'VE HEARD WHAT YOU BOTH THINK ABOUT YOUR CAKES 
BUT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS WHAT DID YOUR TARGET MARKET THINK 
IF YOU TAKE A SEAT WE'LL FIND OUT 
TO MAKE IT FAIR 
OUR TWENTY FIVE EXPERT JUDGES DON'T KNOW WHO'S MADE WHICH PRODUCT 
FIRST UP THE BIG SHOTS' CHOCOLATE LAKE CAKE 
ALL THE JUDGES KNOW THAT THE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN 
AND THE EXTRAS AREN'T INCLUDED 
THE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN WOULD BE A BIT DEAR 
I THINK THAT THE INDOOR SPARKLERS ARE A REALLY GOOD IDEA 
YOU COULD JUST POP THEM ON THE CAKE 
AND MOVE THEM ABOUT OR WHATEVER YOU WANT 
I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT YOU CAN EAT THE MONKEYS AND THE TREES 
I THINK THE PRACTICALITY OF IT 
HAVING TO GET THE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN IS A NUISANCE 
TO GET THAT FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY CAKE TO LOOK GOOD 
IF THERE WAS ANY PROBLEMS 
I THINK IT WOULD BE THAT NOT EVERYONE 
WOULD HAVE A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN 
SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S AS PRACTICAL 
I PREFERRED THE CHOCOLATE LAKE CAKE'S PACKAGING 
BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THE CAKE AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S IN IT 
I THINK THAT THIS CAKE IT'S A CHOCAHOLIC'S DREAM 
I LOVE CHOCOLATE MYSELF AND IT'S FILLED WITH IT SO IT'LL BE GREAT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYBODY COULD FINISH THIS 
I'M NEARLY FULL WITH ONE BIT OF CHOCOLATE 
NEXT TO BE SERVED UP IS THE BRIGHT SPARKS' SHOUT OUT CAKE KIT 
IT'S GOOD THE WAY YOU'RE NOT TIED TO ONE FLAVOUR 
THERE'S SO MANY THERE 
IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE STRAWBERRY THERE'S BLUEBERRY OR APPLE OR LEMON 
I HAD A PART OF THE LEMON PART ON THE SOCK CAKE 
AND I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT 
I LIKE THAT YOU CAN RECORD YOUR OWN MESSAGE ON THE CAKE 
I DON'T THINK THAT A BOY WOULD BUY A CAKE IN THE SHAPE OF A STAR 
I THINK IT'S MORE OF A GIRL CAKE 
I THINK IT'S REALLY NICE YOU CAN ADD YOUR OWN PERSONAL TOUCH TO IT 
THE SOCK CAKE IT WAS MORE OF A GIRLIE CAKE 
WITH THE BOW AND THE SILVER SHINY ON IT 
FOR THE BEST PACKAGING I WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE THE SOCK CAKE 
I THINK THAT THE KIDS MADE THE BIG MONKEY CAKE 
AND THAT THE ADULTS THE PROFESSIONALS 
MADE THE MAKE YOUR OWN CAKE 
BRIGHT SPARKS OUR JUDGES THOUGHT YOUR CAKE WAS A BIT GIRLIE 
BUT THEY LIKED THE FACT 
THAT YOU COULD PERSONALISE THE INDIVIDUAL CAKES 
AND BIG SHOTS OUR JUDGES FELT THAT YOUR CAKE 
WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO CHOCOLATEY 
BUT THEY LOVED THE PACKAGING 
BUT WHO DID THEY VOTE AS THE OVERALL WINNER OF THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY 
COME ON 
I'M ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT HERE 
I HAVE THE RESULT RIGHT HERE IN MY HAND
