THESE FOUR MISCHIEVOUS YOUNG ELLIES 
OUR ROAR RANGER HAS A CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH A HUGE SUMATRAN TIGER 
THAT IS LIKE AMAZING 
AND THESE VICIOUS HOGS MIGHT NOT HAVE THE PRETTIEST FACES 
BUT YOU SHOULD SEE THEIR CUTE BABIES 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO ROAR 
I'M MATT AND I'M RANI AND NEXT TO US HERE ARE JABIR AND LAYLA 
THEY'RE BOTH BARBARY LIONS AND THEY 
ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST ENDANGERED OF THE LION SPECIES 
BARBARY LIONS ARE COMPLETELY EXTINCT IN THE WILD 
AND IT'S ONLY THANKS TO THE WORK OF PARKS LIKE THIS THEY EXIST AT ALL 
BREEDING RARE WILD ANIMALS IS THE PARK'S MOST IMPORTANT JOB 
HOWLETT'S HERE IS THE HOME TO THE LARGEST BREEDING HERD 
OF AFRICAN ELEPHANTS IN THE U. K. 
RECENTLY IT'S BEEN BABY BOOM TIME 
FOUR HAVE BEEN BORN IN JUST TWO YEARS AND THAT'S A NATIONAL RECORD 
THE FIRST ARRIVAL WAS A GIRL CALLED JARA WHO'S A LITTLE MINX 
NEXT CAME JANU A BOY WHO LOVES ROUGH AND TUMBLE 
THEN ANOTHER GIRL CALLED JAMA ARRIVED 
HER MUM MASA IS THE LEADER OF THE HERD AND JAMA USES THAT FACT 
TO THROW HER WEIGHT AROUND JUST LIKE A SPOILED PRINCESS 
NOW THERE'S ANOTHER ARRIVAL A FEW DAYS OLD KEEPER JANINE HUMPHRIES 
WAS THE FIRST TO SEE HIM 
I CAME IN AS USUAL ABOUT SEVEN IN THE MORNING 
TO CHECK ALL THE ELEPHANTS 
I THOUGHT STUVITE'S ACTING STRANGELY AND THEN I SAW 
THE NEW LITTLE ONE UNDERNEATH HER BELLY 
POTTERING ABOUT WITH THE OTHER ELEPHANTS 
I GOT A BIT TEARY BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS REALLY PRIVILEGED 
TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO SEE HIM 
THERE HAVE BEEN TWELVE AFRICAN ELEPHANTS BORN AT THE PARK SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO 
AND BACK THEN IT WAS THE FIRST PLACE IN BRITAIN TO BREED THESE GIANTS 
WITH ALL THESE BABIES TRUNDLING AROUND 
IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE AN ELLIE KEEPER 
LIZ MORRIS IS LOVING IT 
IT'S FANTASTIC WHEN YOU SEE A NEW BORN CALF ESPECIALLY WHEN 
YOU WATCH IT DEVELOP EACH ONE IS DIFFERENT 
ALTHOUGH WE'VE GOT FOUR NOW IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE GOES 
AND HOW HE GETS ON WITH THE OTHERS 
WHEN THEY'RE BORN THE CALVES LOOK RELATIVELY TINY BUT THEY'RE STILL 
THIRTY FIVE TIMES HEAVIER THAN HUMAN BABIES 
TO GET TO THAT SIZE THEY STAY INSIDE THEIR MOTHERS 
FOR A LOT LONGER THAN WE DID 
HUMANS ARE PREGNANT FOR NINE MONTHS 
ELEPHANTS FOR A STAGGERING TWENTY TWO THAT'S NEARLY TWO YEARS 
MUM MAY BE BIG BUT IT WAS STILL A BIT OF A SQUEEZE IN THERE FOR JUVA 
HE IS QUITE A LARGE CALF AS WELL 
BEING CRUMPLED UP IN MUM'S BELLY HIS EARS HAVEN'T FORMED PROPERLY 
THEY'RE FLAPPED OVER 
THEY'RE SLOWLY FOLDING THEMSELVES BACK 
IT TOOK YOU ABOUT A YEAR TO LEARN TO WALK JUVA DID IT ON DAY ONE 
HE'S MOTORING AROUND NOW 
BABY ELEPHANTS ARE QUITE COMICAL WALKING 
THEY HAVEN'T GOT MUCH CONTROL AT FIRST 
THEY'RE QUITE BANDY AND THE ELBOWS AND KNEES ARE COMING OUT 
YEAH IT'S FUN TO WATCH 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT BABY ELEPHANTS GET MOBILE QUICKLY 
BECAUSE IN THE WILD THEY LIVE IN HERDS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY ON THE MOVE 
LOOKING FOR FOOD 
THE HERDS ARE EXCELLENT PROTECTION 
AGAINST PREDATORS SUCH AS LIONS BUT THEY HAVE PECKING ORDERS 
THAT CAN HAVE CONSEQUENCES IF YOU'RE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE 
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS STUVITE IS QUITE LOW RANKING IN THE HERD 
AND BECAUSE A CALF'S EYESIGHT IS NOT VERY GOOD FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS 
IT'S A BIT BLURRY SOMETIMES HE LOST MUM 
HE'D RUN OFF AND BECAUSE STUVITE IS LOW RANKING 
SHE WOULDN'T GO PAST OTHER HIGH RANKING ELEPHANTS 
THEY'D PUSH HIM BACK TOWARDS MUM AND SO HE GOT A FEW LITTLE KNOCKS 
THE FIRST DAY 
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS SPLIT THE 
ELEPHANTS SO WE'VE GOT MUM CALF AND HER OTHER DAUGHTER JUST UNTIL 
HE'S A LITTLE BIT STRONGER A LITTLE BIT BIGGER 
AND THEN WE'LL INTRODUCE HIM BACK TO THE REST OF THE HERD 
THE PLAN'S WORKED WELL AND HAVING BUILT UP HIS STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE 
JUVA'S BACK IN THE PADDOCK AND THRIVING 
WE'LL BRING YOU MORE NEW OF THE YOUNG ELLIES THROUGHOUT THE SERIES 
WE ARE IN THE GORILLA ENCLOSURE AND THE REASON WE'RE 
HERE IS FOR A TREASURE HUNT 
OH THAT'S FANTASTIC I LOVE TREASURE HUNTS 
IT ISN'T FOR YOU 
AND THE GUYS WHO ARE GONNA TELL US ALL ABOUT IT ARE THESE KEEPERS 
BRIAN HANNAH AND MATT STAG 
HIYA GUYS SO WHAT KIND OF TREASURE HUNT IS THIS 
WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME FOOD OUT FOR THE GORILLAS YES 
THEY'VE GOT TO EXPLORE AND FIND THE FOOD IN THE ENCLOSURE 
BRILLIANT LET'S CRACK ON 
THIS IS JUST A BUNCH OF BRANCHES 
WHERE DO WE PUT IT ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE 
SO IS IT LIKE THEY WOULD FIND IT IN THE WILD ALMOST 
YEAH OBVIOUSLY IN THE WILD IT'S NOT PACKAGED FOR THEM 
THEY'VE GOT TO USE THEIR BRAINS TO START EATING 
WE TRY AND REPLICATE THAT A LITTLE BIT 
ALL DONE 
THE ONLY THING TO DO IS TO LET THEM OUT 
AND SEE WHAT THEY MAKE OF THEIR LITTLE FEAST YEAH BRILLIANT 
IT'S TIME TO BEAT A HASTY RETREAT AND FIND A GOOD SPOT TO WATCH FROM 
HERE THEY COME 
LOOK AT THEM BURSTING OUT 
A COUPLE OF LITTLE ONES FIRST THERE 
AND THEN THE BIG SILVERBACK MALE 
THEY'RE NO RESPECTERS OF RANK THESE LITTLE BABIES ARE THEY 
THE DOOR OPENS THEY CAN SQUEEZE OUT OF THE GAP FIRST OH I SEE 
CLEVER THEY SNEAK OUT AND GET A HEAD START 
BUT DOES THE SILVERBACK GET THE CHOICE OF THE FOOD FIRST 
GENERALLY IF HE WANTS TO OBVIOUSLY LETTUCE AND SPRING ONION 
IS NOT THAT EXCITING FOR HIM SO HE'S NOT GONNA GO MAD 
IF IT WAS SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING 
YOU'D SEE HIM ASSERTING HIS AUTHORITY M. O. E. 
WHAT WOULD HIS FAVOURITE BE THEY'RE THE SAME AS CHILDREN 
ANYTHING THEY SHOULDN'T BE EATING STICKY AND SWEET 
TODAY THEY'VE GOT TO EAT THEIR GREENS 
THEY'VE VERY DEXTROUS WITH THEIR HANDS 
YEAH YOU WATCH THEM EAT THE BOUGHS 
THEY USE THEIR HANDS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT 
THEY'LL PUT IT BETWEEN THEIR TEETH AND SHRED THE BARK OFF 
THEY PULL IT THROUGH THEIR TEETH YEAH WELL THEY ALL SEEM HAPPY 
MUNCHING ON THEIR BOOTY THE TREASURE THEY FOUND 
IT WAS GREAT FUN WASN'T IT RANI THANKS VERY MUCH 
NO PROBLEM 
WHAT DID THE LITTLE BIRD SAY TO THE BIG BIRD I DON'T KNOW 
PECK ON SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE 
CHARLOTTE HOW DO ELEPHANTS COMMUNICATE 
I DON'T KNOW 
BY ELEPHONE 
WHAT'S DRACULA'S FAVOURITE DOG 
I DON'T KNOW 
BLOODHOUND 
MEET GOSHO AND TAFIKA 
THE WONDERFULLY WEIRD LOOKING RED RIVER HOGS 
THEY ORIGINALLY COME FROM THE FORESTS 
OF CENTRAL AND WESTERN AFRICA 
HEAD OF HOOFSTOCK JOEL BUNCE LOOKS AFTER THESE MISCHIEVOUS PORKERS 
AND HAS RECENTLY NOTICED SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT TAFIKA 
HER BELLY'S TWICE THE SIZE IT NORMALLY IS 
SHE'S GOT SIX NICE TEATS COME UP AND HER BEHAVIOUR'S CHANGED SLIGHTLY 
ALL THIS MEANS ONE THING 
MR. AND MRS. PIG ARE EXPECTING YOUNG ONES FAIRLY SOON HOPEFULLY 
THE KEEPERS ARE RELIEVED TO SEE THE PAIR SETTLING DOWN 
TO START A FAMILY BECAUSE THEY USED TO BE A COUPLE OF TEARAWAYS 
LAST YEAR THEY EVEN MADE A DARING ESCAPE FROM THEIR ENCLOSURE 
CAUSING THE PARK TO GO ON FULL ALERT 
THEY JUST COMPLETELY 
UPROOTED THE MESH THAT WAS BURIED IN THE GROUND 
THEIR NOSES ARE VERY VERY TOUGH AND ALTHOUGH THIS IS VERY ROCKY 
AND STONY THEY ARE ABLE TO USE THEIR SNOUT WITH GREAT EFFECT 
LIKE THAT THEIR SNOUTS ARE JUST AS GOOD AS ANY 
SHOVEL OR PAIR OF HANDS 
EVEN THOUGH THEY TUNNELLED OUT OF THEIR PEN 
THEY WERE STILL SAFELY CONTAINED IN THE PARK BY THE OUTER FENCE 
YOU MIGHT THINK THE RED RIVER HOGS LOOK FUNNY BUT THEY CAN BE VICIOUS 
AS JOEL FOUND OUT WHEN HE FINALLY CORNERED THE ESCAPEES 
THE MALE DID ACTUALLY BITE ME ON THE BACKSIDE 
OUCH THAT SOUNDS PAINFUL 
BUT IT'S ALL HISTORY NOW THE HOGS HAVEN'T ESCAPED AGAIN 
AND ONE YEAR ON ARE GETTING READY TO RAISE A FAMILY 
PREGNANT RED RIVER HOGS INSTINCTLY BUILD SOMETHING CALLED A BOWER 
A SHELTER IN THE LONG GRASS WHERE NEWBORN PIGLETS CAN BE HIDDEN 
TAFIKA DOESN'T HAVE LONG GRASS HERE TO BUILD A SHELTER IN 
BUT KEEPER JOEL CAN PROVIDE A GOOD REPLACEMENT FOR HER TO USE INSTEAD 
IT'S A NEW EXPERIENCE 
FOR THIS FIRST TIME MOTHER 
AND HER KEEPER'S GOING TO WATCH HER CAREFULLY 
THEY'RE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE ANIMALS IN THE PARK AND 
WE'VE NEVER BRED A SPECIES OF WILD PIG HERE BEFORE 
I CERTAINLY THINK SHE'S GONNA 
GIVE BIRTH TO NICE HEALTHY PIGLETS 
IT'S JUST WHETHER SHE LOOKS AFTER THEM OR NOT THAT'S THE MAIN THING 
IT'S A NERVY TIME 
IN THE WILD A LARGE PERCENTAGE 
OF RED RIVER HOGLETS DON'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE FIRST FEW HOURS OF LIFE 
WILL TAFIKA'S BABIES SURVIVE WILL SHE LOOK AFTER THEM 
OR WILL JOEL HAVE TO STEP IN AND RAISE THEM HIMSELF 
WE'LL HAVE THE ANSWERS LATER ON 
THE PARKS LOOK AFTER THIRTEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SMALL CAT 
AND I'M OFF TO VISIT ONE OF MY FAVOURITES 
MELINDI THE FRIENDLY SERVAL 
SERVALS LIKE MELINDI COME FROM AFRICA AND ARE FANTASTIC HUNTERS BECAUSE OF 
THEIR INCREDIBLE AGILITY 
I DON'T THINK THEY EVER HUNT RUBBER DUCKS IN THE WILD 
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS TODAY IT'S NOT REALLY JUST ABOUT PLAY IS IT 
NOT STRICTLY JUST ABOUT PLAY WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO 
RECREATE THE METHOD SHE'D USE FOR HUNTING 
WOULD THEY NORMALLY HUNT ORANGE DUCKS 
NOT NORMALLY NO BUT THEY DO HUNT BIRDS THINGS LIKE GUINEA FOWL 
SO THIS IS OUR VERSION OF IT THEN 
OR HUNTING NATURALLY IN THE WILD 
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT THE BEST WE CAN GET HOLD OF HERE SHE GOES 
SHE LIKES TO RAISE UP AS WELL 
SHE DOES THEY ARE EXTREMELY GOOD AT JUMPING VERY VERY GOOD 
THEY CAN JUMP TEN FEET EASILY 
ARE YOU MAKING THAT UP NO 
I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET A PROPER DEMONSTRATION 
GO ON THEN MELINDI SHOW US YOUR STUFF 
NO NOT THAT BIT SILLY HERE 
SHE LIKES THE STRING AS WELL 
OH SHE CAN GO FOR IT CAN'T SHE 
THAT'S JUST AT HER FULL STRETCH LET ALONE WHEN SHE'S ATAKING OFF 
OH SHE'S GOT IT 
HOW MANY TIMES A WEEK WOULD YOU DO THIS PLAY TIME 
WE LIKE TO DO IT IF WE GET A BIT OF SPARE TIME 
IT'S NICE JUST TO KEEP HER INTERESTED KEEP HER HAPPY 
A BIT OF STIMULATION FOR HER 
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S GETTING THE BETTER OF ME NOW 
SHE'D BE HAPPIER IF YOU LET HER HAVE THAT CHICKEN I THINK I'D BETTER

WE'VE HAD A CALL TO GET DOWN TO THE RED RIVER HOG HOUSE AND MEET KEEPER 
JOEL BUNCE HE'S GOT SOME EXCITING NEWS FROM THESE REFORMED TEARAWAYS 
YESTERDAY OUR FEMALE RED RIVER HOG 
HOG GAVE BIRTH TO THREE HEALTHY LOOKING PIGLETS 
THIS IS FANTASTIC IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT THE PARKS 
HAS SUCCESSFULLY BRED RED RIVER HOGS AND THESE PIGLETS ARE REALLY CUTE 
WELL DONE TAFIKA 
SHE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT REALLY SHE CAME BACK INTO THE SHED 
SHE NEST BUILT AND SHE GOT COMFORTABLE AND 
SHE'S IN THERE NOW SUCKLING THE PIGLETS 
AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE JUST MILK GUZZLING BLOBS REALLY 
AS SOON AS THEY'VE SUCKLED 
THEY LAY THERE WITH BIG FAT BELLIES SLEEPING IT OFF 
IN THE WILD THE PIGLETS' STRIPY COATS ACT AS GREAT CAMOUFLAGE 
FROM PREDATORS IN THEIR FOREST HOMES 
WHEN THEY GET BIG STRONG AND FAST ENOUGH TO ESCAPE DANGER 
THEIR COATS WILL BECOME JUST LIKE THEIR PARENTS' 
EVEN HERE WITH NO NATURAL PREDATORS 
THESE THREE ARE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS JUST YET 
THERE'S ALWAYS A DANGER OF LOSING THEM UP TO A FEW MONTHS OLD 
THEY'RE ALWAYS A RISK OF THEY'RE VERY PRONE TO STRESS COLD 
SHE MAY DECIDE THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO LOOK AFTER THEM AFTER ALL 
AFTER A FEW DAYS OR A WEEK 
THAT'S STILL VERY MUCH A CONCERN 
SHE SEEMS TO BE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB AT THE MOMENT 
HOPEFULLY OUR CONCERNS WON'T BE REALISED IN THE FUTURE 
AND SHE'LL DO THE JOB HERSELF I THINK 
MUM AND THE BABIES ARE LOOKING GREAT BUT HOW'S DAD DOING 
DAD IS A LITTLE BIT PUT OUT HE'S ON HIS OWN AT THE MOMENT 
SO WE'RE GIVING HIM EXTRA ATTENTION TO FEEL MORE WANTED 
COS ALL THE ATTENTION'S ON HER AT THE MOMENT 
OTHER THAN THAT HE'S DOING O. K. HOPEFULLY HE'LL MEET 
HIS OFFSPRING THROUGH THE FENCE AND SEE WHAT REACTION HE GIVES 
LATER IN THE SHOW THESE THREE PIGGIES WILL BE RELEASED 
INTO THEIR SMALL YARD TO MEET THEIR DAD FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME 
BUT HE IS UNPREDICTABLE POWERFUL AND CAN BE VICIOUS 
HE'S ALREADY BITTEN JOEL BEFORE 
THE KEEPERS HAVE NO IDEA HOW HE'LL REACT TO THE YOUNGSTERS 
WE'LL BE THERE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY MEET 
OUR ROAR RANGER TODAY IS ELEVEN YEAR OLD NED FROM BROMLEY IN KENT 
HE'S A CAT LOVER AND CAN HARDLY WAIT 
TO FIND OUT WHAT HIS FIRST ASSIGNMENT IS 
NED TODAY YOU ARE A TIGER KEEPER 
YOUR JOB IS TO GIVE THE TIGERS A TREAT 
WOW THAT'S SO AMAZING I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE IN MY LIFE 
THE CLOSEST THING I'VE GOT TO HAVING A TIGER IS MY CAT AT HOME 
MIAOW 
NED'S OFF TO MEET BEN WARREN 
WHO LOOKS AFTER THE TWO SUMATRAN TIGERS 
SUMATRAN TIGERS ARE INCREDIBLY RARE 
THERE ARE PROBABLY LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED OF THEM LEFT IN THE WILD 
THEY'RE ALSO THE SMALLEST SPECIES OF TIGER 
BUT THEY'RE STILL OVER TEN TIMES BIGGER THAN NED'S CAT 
AND HAVE FANGS SEVEN C. M. LONG THAT'S THE SIZE OF YOUR BIG FINGER 
HI NED I'M BEN I LOOK AFTER THE TIGERS HOW ARE YOU 
FINE READY FOR SOME WORK YEAH 
YOUR JOB IS TO HELP ME CLEAN OUT THE SUMATRAN TIGER ENCLOSURE COOL 
WE CLEAN OUT THEIR BED MAKE IT COMFORTABLE 
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT REALLY EXCITED 
M. M. M. THOSE TIGERS LOOK HUNGRY 
BUT BEFORE THE TIGERS GET THEIR DAILY TREATS 
IT'S TIME FOR NED TO TACKLE SOME HARD WORK 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GOING INTO A TIGER'S CAGE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S HAPPENING YEAH FEELS LIKE A DREAM LET'S GO 
THE TIME'S COME FOR NED TO SNEAK INTO THE TIGERS' LAIR 
BUT SSH THEY'RE CLOSE BY AND THEY'RE WATCHING 
THE SHED'S OVER THERE SHALL WE GO YEAH 
WHILE WE'RE IN HERE WE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL 
COS OBVIOUSLY THE TIGERS ARE JUST NEXT DOOR 
AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE TOUCHING THE FENCE OR ANYTHING 
NED'S FIRST JOB IS TO CLEAN OUT THE TIGERS' SLEEPING QUARTERS 
THEY MIGHT LOOK MAGNIFICENT BUT THEY DON'T HALF PONG 
IT SMELLS A BIT LIKE WEE 
YEAH BASICALLY TIGERS MARK THEIR TERRITORY 
THEY DO THIS BY SPRAYING WEE EVERYWHERE 
THEN THAT INDICATES TO OTHER TIGERS THAT THIS IS THEIR TERRITORY 
AND DON'T MESS WITH ME SORT OF THING 
THIS ISN'T PLEASANT BEST TO HURRY UP AND GET IT OVER AND DONE WITH 
BRILLIANT JOB THERE 
NOW THE DIRTY STRAW'S OUT WE PUT THE CLEAN STUFF IN 
GET A MOVE ON YOU TWO THE TIGERS ARE GETTING TWITCHY 
NOW THAT WE'VE MADE THEIR BED WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE STRAW OUT 
THEN WE'LL GIVE THEM A LITTLE TREAT THAT I'VE PREPARED FOR THEM GOOD 
WE'VE GOT SOME BITS OF MEAT SO THEY COME OVER TO THE FENCE 
THEY'VE ALREADY SEEN US THEY'RE COMING OVER NOW 
COME ON KIDS COME ON 
F. F. F. F. F. F. 
THAT NOISE THAT CHUFFING NOISE IS BASICALLY SAYING HELLO 
IF THEY'RE IN A GOOD MOOD THEY'LL DO IT BACK 
THESE ARE VERY GRUMPY SO THEY JUST TEND TO HISS AT YOU 
DO YOU WANT TO TRY TO LEARN HOW TO CHUFF O. K. 
YOU HAVE TO GO F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. THAT'S CLOSE GOOD 
TRY A BIT LOUDER F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. THAT'S GOOD 
THEY SAY PRACTISE MAKES PURR FECT 
F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. 
F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. 
AND EVENTUALLY THE BIG CATS START RESPONDING 
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T NORMALLY SEE THIS ONE IS INDA 
SHE'S MUCH LIGHTER IN COLOUR AND A BIT SMALLER SHE'S THE FEMALE COOL 
THAT'S THE MALE OVER THERE HE'S MUCH DARKER AND A BIT STOCKIER 
HE'S THE NICER OUT OF THE TWO THIS ONE'S A BIT OF A BULLY 
AND HERE'S WHAT THE TIGERS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SOME HAND FED MEAT 
WE CAN MAKE HER STAND UP SEE 
SHE'S STRETCHING THERE SHE GOES 
THAT'S MUCH HIGHER THAN I AM 
THAT IS AMAZING THAT TIGER IS ABOUT TWICE THE HEIGHT OF YOU 
SHE CAN STAND ABOUT EIGHT FOOT TALL SHE COULD EASILY KNOCK ME OVER 
OH EASILY 
THAT'S AN AMAZING NOISE 
BUT WHEN THEY ROAR OUT WHAT'S THAT SAYING 
THAT'S A WARNING THAT MEANS THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT ANGRY SO STAY BACK 
NED'S HAD A COOL TIME OF IT 
AND HE'S HEADED STRAIGHT BACK TO BASE TO RECORD HIS RANGER DIARY 
TODAY WAS THE BEST DAY EVER I GOT TO BE A TIGER KEEPER FOR THE DAY 
THE GUIDE TAUGHT ME HOW TO SPEAK LIKE A TIGER AND WE GOT TO SEE 
HOW TALL THEY WERE WHICH IS I THINK EIGHT FOOT 
TWO TIMES BIGGER THAN ME AND THAT'S 
TEN TIMES BIGGER THAN MY CAT SCRAPPY AT HOME 
NED GOT ON REALLY WELL TODAY 
HE'S ASKING ALL THE RIGHT QUESTIONS INTRIGUED AS TO WHAT WAS GOING ON 
I'M SURE HE'LL MAKE A GOOD TIGER KEEPER IN A FEW YEARS 
I HAD A GREAT DAY AS A TIGER KEEPER IT WAS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE 
WE'RE OFF TO VISIT ANOTHER ANIMAL 
FROM THE INDONESIAN ISLAND OF SUMATRA NOW 
ONE THAT'S ALMOST AS RARE AS THE SUMATRAN TIGER 
IT'S THE MALAYAN TAPIR I'M MEETING KEEPER MIKE IN THEIR ENCLOSURE 
MIKE I'VE HEARD THE TAPIRS HAVE GOT SORE LEGS IS THAT RIGHT 
THAT'S RIGHT IN THIS PADDOCK WE'VE GOT ONE WHO LAST YEAR GAVE BIRTH 
AND SINCE THE BIRTH SHE'S HAD PROBLEMS WITH HER LEGS 
SIXTEEN MONTHS LATER SHE STILL HAS STIFFNESS IN THE LEGS 
SO WHAT WE'LL TRY AND FIND HER AND PUT SOME OF THIS GEL ON 
WHICH SHOULD MAKE THINGS A BIT EASIER FOR HER BRILLIANT 
I CAN'T SEE THEM THEY SHOULD STAND OUT 
COS THEY'RE BIG BLACK AND WHITE CREATURES AREN'T THEY YES 
AND YOU'D THINK THAT AGAINST ALL THIS GREEN THEY'D BE EASY TO SEE 
BUT THE COLOURING MIMICS SHADOW AND SUNLIGHT AND FROM A DISTANCE 
THEY MAY LOOK LIKE A LARGE ROCK WITH A BIT OF SHADOW BEHIND IT 
WE ARE FAIRLY LUCKY WE KNOW ROUGHLY WHERE THEY'LL BE MOST OF THE TIME 
AND I THINK IF WE JUST LOOK UP IN THIS CORNER THERE THEY ARE 
I'LL LET YOU LEAD THE WAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM 
HEY GIRLS TAKE IT EASY 
THEY'RE RUNNING AWAY 
GOOD GIRLS THAT'S O. K. 
IF WE KEEP TALKING TO THEM THEY'LL KNOW WE'RE ARRIVING HEY 
HERE WE ARE MIKE SHE'S NICE AND CALM NOW ISN'T SHE 
YEAH NOW SHE'S GOT OVER HER INITIAL SHOCK OF SEEING US APPROACHING 
SHE'S NICE AND STEADY NOW AND SHE'S READY FOR A MASSAGE 
WHICH I'M GONNA BE DOING MIKE HAS KINDLY LET ME HELP OUT 
I'VE GOT SOME ARNICA AND WITCH HAZEL 
I'M GOING TO START RUBBING IT ON TO HER BACK LEGS HOW DO I DO THIS 
JUST MASSAGE IT IN FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM 
YEAH START OFF AT THE VERY TOP OF HER BACK LEGS JUST HERE 
YEAH AND THEN WORK YOUR WAY ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE O. K. 
WHY WOULD WE USE ARNICA 
SHE HAS THIS STIFFNESS WHEN SHE GETS UP SOMETIMES 
AND WE COULD GIVE HER MEDICATION TO HELP WITH IT 
BUT WE DON'T LIKE HER BEING ON DRUGS FOR TOO LONG RIGHT 
THIS IS A NATURAL REMEDY AND IT'S STUFF THAT WE AS HUMANS 
CAN USE OURSELVES FOR HELPING TO EASE THE PAIN OF BRUISES AND SO ON 
O. K. IT'S A GOOD FORM OF MASSAGE FOR HER AS WELL 
SO WE'VE SOMETHING THAT SHE FEELS HAPPY WITH AND IT'S DOING HER GOOD 
I'VE GOT TO MENTION SHE'S GOT QUITE BIG LEGS HASN'T SHE 
YEAH THEY'RE QUITE STOCKY 
BUT THEY ARE TO SUPPORT THIS HUGE BODY WEIGHT REALLY 
I THINK MY HEALING HANDS HAVE PROBABLY HELPED TODAY 
AND MAYBE NEXT TIME I'LL LET YOU DO ALL THE HARD WORK 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
HERE YOU GO 
IT'S A VERY BIG DAY IN HOGTOWN 
THE THREE LITTLE HOGS HAVE BEEN SHUT IN THEIR SHEDS SUCKLING FROM MUM 
AND ARE GETTING FATTER EVERY MINUTE 
BUT KEEPER JOEL IS NERVOUS 
HE NEEDS TO INTRODUCE THEM TO THEIR DAD FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME 
BUT HE'S MUCH BIGGER THAN THEY ARE VERY STRONG AND QUITE UNPREDICTABLE 
THINGS COULD GO EITHER WAY 
JOEL'S TAKING NO CHANCES OVER THE HOGLETS' WELLBEING 
MUM AND THE LITTLE ONES WILL BE SEPARATED FROM DAD BY A FENCE 
AND HE'LL BE WATCHING THEM ALL VERY CAREFULLY 
WE'VE JUST LET THE FEMALE HOG AND HER PIGLETS OUT FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME 
IT'S A NICE ENOUGH DAY IT'S NICE AND WARM FOR THEM 
SO THEY'VE RESPONDED QUITE WELL SURPRISINGLY 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE SEEN DAD SINCE THEY'VE BEEN BORN 
THEY MIGHT HAVE HEARD HIM AND HE'S PROBABLY HEARD THEM 
BUT THEY CAN SEE EACH OTHER THROUGH THE FENCE HAVE SOME CONTACT 
THEY CAN TOUCH NOSES HE'S BEEN GREAT 
HE'S NOT SHOWN ANY AGGRESSION AND HE'S LOOKED QUITE INTERESTED 
THEY'VE LOOKED AT HIM AND SEEMED QUITE INTERESTED SO HOPEFULLY 
IF WE GET TO PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER IT SHOULD GO QUITE WELL 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE FIRST CONTACT WITH DAD WAS A SUCCESS 
WHICH PROBABLY MEANS HE'S ACCEPTED THEM 
IT'S NORMAL FOR RED RIVER HOG PIGLETS TO BE AROUND THEIR FATHERS 
WHEN THEY'RE GROWING UP IN THE WILD THEY LIVE IN FAMILY GROUPS 
MADE UP OF ONE MALE SEVERAL FEMALES AND ALL THEIR CHILDREN 
THEY'RE JUST STARTING TO SHOW INTEREST IN FOOD NOW 
PARTICULARLY SOME OF THE SOFTER ITEMS LIKE BANANA AND BREAD 
IT'S NORMALLY AROUND ABOUT THREE TO FOUR WEEKS THAT 
THEY'LL START EATING PROPERLY AND THEN THEY'LL PROBABLY BE PRETTY MUCH 
DEPENDENT ON SOLID FOOD RATHER THAN MILK AT ABOUT SEVEN WEEKS 
JUST TESTING AND TASTING AT THE MOMENT 
BUT YEAH IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE THEY'RE EATING 
PROBABLY JUST AS MUCH AS HER I SHOULD THINK 
WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE A LOOK AS TO WHAT SEX THEY ARE YET 
NOT PROPERLY WE HAVEN'T GOT IN THERE AND PICKED THEM UP OR ANYTHING 
BUT FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN JUST OVER THE FENCE AND IN THE DENS 
IT LOOKS LIKE THREE BOYS 
SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE EXTREMELY BOISTEROUS AS THEY GET OLDER 
AND GIVE HER A LOT OF GRIEF OVER THE COMING MONTHS 
JUST WHAT JOEL NEEDS 
THREE MORE MISCHIEVOUS RED RIVER HOGS TO KEEP HIM ON HIS TOES 
HOPEFULLY THEY WON'T GROW UP TO BE ESCAPE ARTISTS LIKE THEIR PARENTS 
IN THE WILD THE FIRST THREE MONTHS 
OF A RED RIVER HOG'S LIFE ARE THE MOST HAZARDOUS 
IF THEY MAKE IT TO THAT AGE THEY COULD LIVE UP TO TWENTY YEARS 
SO THESE PIGLETS HAVE SOME WAY TO GO BEFORE THE KEEPERS CAN RELAX 
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW HOW THEY GET ON 
WE'VE HAD ANOTHER SMASHING DAY AND IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR US TO GO 
BUT BEFORE WE DO WE'VE JUST COME OVER TO HELP KEEPER NICK 
LET THE GIRAFFES OUT ONTO THE AFRICAN EXPERIENCE 
NICK SHALL WE OPEN THAT GATE WE'LL GIVE IT A GO 
NICK HOW TRICKY IS IT TO GET GIRAFFE TO DO WHAT YOU WANT 
WELL UM A LITTLE TRICKY ACTUALLY COS THEY DON'T REALLY NECESSARILY 
DO WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO ALL THE TIME 
THEY'RE QUITE SETTLED AT THE MOMENT THEY LOOK PRETTY HAPPY THAT'S IT 
THAT'S IT IF ONE OF THEM MOVES WILL THEY ALL GO 
YEAH THEY TEND TO FOLLOW EACH OTHER 
WE'VE GOT ONE COMING OVER FOR A LITTLE LOOK 
HERE'S THE LITTLE FELLA HE'S THE YOUNGEST OF THE GROUP 
HE IS YEAH HE'S ELEVEN MONTHS OLD SO YEAH 
HE'S A BIG BOY FOR ELEVEN MONTHS OLD HE IS HE CERTAINLY IS 
IF THEY SEEM QUITE SETTLED WHY ARE WE LETTING THEM OUT 
WE HAD JUST HAD THEM IN THE YARDS EARLIER SO THEY'LL GO OUT 
AND SPEND THEIR DAYS OUT THERE THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER 
IT'S MORE OF A NATURAL AREA FOR THEM 
WHAT ANIMALS DO THEY SHARE THE AFRICAN EXPERIENCE WITH 
OBVIOUSLY THE RHINOS ARE OUT THERE THE WILDEBEEST ZEBRAS 
AND THE TALLEST BIRDS AS WELL LOOK AT THAT 
THE TALLEST BIRDS IN THE WORLD NEXT TO THE TALLEST LAND ANIMALS 
WHAT A WAY TO END THE DAY 
IT'S BEEN BRILLIANT THIS IS WHAT'S COMING UP ON THE NEXT EPISODE 
THE CARACAL HAS SUFFERED A HORRIBLE INJURY 
CAN THIS OPERATION SAVE HER LIFE 
WE'RE GOING TO BE MEETING SOME VERY AGITATED GORILLAS 
BUT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF SOMEONE KEPT BANGING ON YOUR WINDOW 
AND OUR ROAR RANGER IS ALMOST OVERCOME BY SOME RANK SMELLING POO 
DISGUSTING SNIFF NO IT SMELLS TOO MUCH
