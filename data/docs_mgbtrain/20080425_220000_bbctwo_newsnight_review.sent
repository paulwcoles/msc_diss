HOPE OF ESCAPE FROM IRAQ IS DASHED 
NOBEL PRIZEWINNER DORIS LESSING 
REINVENTS HER FATHER AND MOTHER I I KEEP THINKING IT COULD ALL HAVE 
BEEN DONE BETTER DONE DIFFERENTLY 
IS MUSICAL GONE WITH THE WIND 
WORTH DAMN 
AND THE SIXTIES SOUND OF SCOTT WALKER 
CELEBRATED BY THE ARCTIC MONKEYS 
JOINING ME AUTHOR AND SCREENWRITER 
ANTHONY HOROWITZ WRITER AND 
COMEDIAN NATALIE HAYNES AND WRITER 
AND BROADCASTER DAVID AARONOVITCH 
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CRIMEAN WAR TOOK 
MONTHS TO ARRIVE BACK IN BRITAIN 
SOLDIERS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 
SET THEIR OWN MOVIES TO MUSIC AND 
TEXT THEM HOME IT WAS WATCHING 
THOSE U. G. C. FILMS OF WAR EXPERIENCES 
WHICH INSPIRED THE DIRECTOR 
KIMBERLY PEIRCE TO MAKE STOP LOSS 
A STORY OF SOLDIERS WHO ARE 
RECALLED TO FIGHT AGAINST THEIR 
WILL IT HAS TAKEN THE DIRECTOR 
NINE YEARS TO FOLLOW UP ON HER 
OSCAR WINNING DEBUT FEATURE BOYS 
DON'T CRY AND THE RESEARCH FOR 
STOP LOSS WAS CLOSE TO HOME HER 
OWN HALF BROTHER SIGNED UP TO FIGHT 
AFTER NINE ELEVEN RYAN PHILLIPPE PLAYS 
BRANDON THE SQUAD LEADER WHO 
RESIGNS HIS COMMISSION AFTER A 
TRAUMATIC TOUR IN IRAQ WHERE SOME 
OF HIS MEN ARE KILLED BRANDON 
RETURNS TO HERO'S WELCOME IN 
TEXAS BUT GETS TOLD HE HAS TO GO 
BACK TO THE FRONT 
HOW CAN THEY DO THIS 
THEY ARE 
DOING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH A 
SHORTAGE OF MEN AND NO DRAUGHT 
THEY ARE SHIPPING BACK SOLDIERS WHO 
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING OUT 
WHAT ABOUT STEVE 
SOME OF US ARE 
GETTING IT SOME ARE NOT THIS THIS CANNOT BE HAPPENING DO YOU WANT ME 
TO TAKE YOU TO MEXICO 
OUT OF THE 
QUESTION QUESTION LOOKING AT THIS FILM THERE HAVE 
BEEN SO MANY MOVIES ABOUT IRAQ DO 
YOU THINK THIS HAS ANYTHING TO ADD 
THAT IS GOING TO BE ITS PROBLEM 
PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO SEE THIS 
FILM FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT 
THEY HAD SEEN ENOUGH AND ON THE 
FACE OF IT THIS IS ANOTHER GENERIC 
IRAQ FILM BUT ACTUALLY I THINK IT 
IS THE BEST THERE HAS BEEN SO FAR 
IT LACKS THE PORTENTOUSNESS AND THE 
BOREDOM OF SOME OF THEM AND THE 
SILLINESS OF OTHERS LIKED IT FOR 
A LOT OF REASONS THE FIRST IS THAT 
IT IS BALANCED FILM IT IS NOT 
JUST AGAINST THE WALL AND THE ARMY 
AND MANY OF THE CHARACTERS LIVE 
THEIR LIFE THROUGH THE ARMY AND I 
LOVE THE CHARACTERS EVEN RYAN 
PHILLIPPE NOT ONE OF THE GREATEST 
ACTORS IN HOLLYWOOD BUT DOING 
NICELY JUDGED PERFORMANCE FOR 
SOMEONE OUT OF HIS DEPTH THINK 
IT IS VERY WELL DIRECTED AND I 
THINK THE SUBJECT IS WORTH BEARING 
DID YOU SEE THE SAME DEPTH IN THIS 
I THOUGHT THE PERFORMANCES WERE 
TREMENDOUS RYAN PHILLIPPE IS 
GROWING AS AN ACTOR AND EMILY 
PEARCE'S GREAT STRENGTH AS A 
DIRECTOR IS THE PERFORMANCE THAT 
SHE PULLS OUT OF EVERYONE WHO ACTS 
FOR HER 
HE PLAYS BRANDON COMING 
BACK AND FINDING IT HARD TO ADJUST 
AND HE IS A MUCH MORE INTERESTING 
CHARACTER THEN YOU MIGHT ASSUME HE 
IS NOT A CHARACTER WHO WANTS TO GO 
A. W. O. L. BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE IT 
BECAUSE HE IS NOT IN FAVOUR OF THE 
WAR AND DOES NOT LIKE THE ARMY HE 
HAS DONE HIS TOUR OF DUTY PAID OUT 
HIS CONTRACT IN HIS OWN WORDS THE 
BOX IN YOUR HEAD WHERE YOU PUT THE 
STUFF THAT YOU CANNOT DEAL WITH HIS 
FULL AND HE NEEDS TO MOVE AWAY IT 
IS A STRIKING PERFORMANCE OF A MAN 
ON THE EDGE 
THIS IDEA OF A SOLDIER 
DAMAGED BY THE WAR EXPERIENCE 
RETURNING HOME HAS BEEN TREATED IN 
BOOKS AND FILMS BEFORE 
IN THAT 
SENSE IT IS A VERY CONVENTIONAL 
STORY INSOFAR AS YOU ARE PART OF 
HIS JOURNEY IT IS A JOURNEY 
THROUGH THE PEOPLE THROUGH THE 
FAMILIES OF THE SQUAD MEMBER WHO 
WAS LOST AND THE VERY BADLY INJURED 
SQUAD MEMBER WHO HAS LOST ONE LEG 
ONE ARM AND HIS SIGHT AND SO 
THAT IS ALSO WE CAN REMEMBER THAT 
FROM THE VIETNAM WAR MOVIES L. 
THINK THE THING THAT THIS ADDS 
WHICH IS INTERESTING IS THAT IT 
TELLS YOU THAT THE CALCULATION HAS 
NOW CHANGED FROM THE DAYS OF 
VIETNAM WHAT HE IS ANGRY ABOUT IS 
HIS SENSE OF HAVING BEEN LIED TO BY 
THE SYSTEM NOT ABOUT THE WAR 
ITSELF BUT IT ABOUT HIS AGREEMENT 
WITH IT IT IS THAT NEW TYPE OF 
CONTRACT THAT IS BEGINNING TO EXIST 
IN THE WEST BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND 
THE ARMY WHICH IN A WAY THIS FILM 
TOUCHES ON 
IT IS ABOUT THE 
COVENANT THE CONFLICT OF DUTY HE 
FEELS LOYAL TO THE ARMY YET THE 
ARMY HAS BETRAYED HIM 
IT FOR ME 
THAT WAS THE WEAKEST THING IN THE 
FILM I WISH I HAD FELT MORE OF THE 
AVERAGE THE SCENE IN WHICH HE HAS 
TOLD THE NEWS AND HE STORMS OUT 
ALTHOUGH IT IS A POWERFUL SCENE I 
WISH I HAD FELT MORE MORAL OUTRAGE 
ON HIS BEHALF IT DOES BECOME A 
SORT OF A ROAD MOVIE WHICH IS ITS 
WEAKNESS 
THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO IT WEAKNESS THERE IS THE WAR AND THEN THE ROAD MOVIE 
THAT IS WHY STRUCTURALLY MOVIE AS A FILM IT IS BETTER ACTED THAN 
IT IS WRITTEN STRUCTURALLY IT DOES 
NOT QUITE WORKED THE OPENING 
SEQUENCES IN IRAQ ARE WELL SHOT 
WELL PUT TOGETHER TERRIFYING THEY 
DO NOT TO DO ANYTHING THAT YOU DID 
NOT ALREADY KNOW PROBABLY I COULD 
HAVE TOLD YOU THAT IF YOU ARE 
FIGHTING AN ENEMY WHO HAVE HAD A 
HAND GRENADE IN ONE HAND AND A BABY 
IN THE OTHER YOU WILL END UP 
TRAUMATISED BUT IT WORKS WELL THE 
ROAD MOVIE SECTION NOT SO MUCH IT 
IS AN UNSATISFYING GENRE THE ROAD 
MOVIE 
DO YOU THINK THAT THE WAR MOVIE SCENES WERE GIVEN GREATER VIVIDNESS 
BECAUSE OF THE USE OF U. G. C. MATERIAL 
THE FACT THAT SHE WAS USING 
MATERIAL SHOT BY SOLDIERS 
THEMSELVES 
WELL THIS HAS BECOME THEMSELVES THE STANDARD WAY OF DEPICTING IRAQ 
IF YOU SAW REDACTED WHICH WAS 
ALMOST ENTIRELY SUPPOSEDLY 
COMPILED OF FILM THAT VARIOUS 
PEOPLE HAD TAKEN INCLUDING THE 
INSURGENTS AND SO ON AND INCLUDING 
FAMILIES BACK THERE WHERE THE 
WHOLE TECHNIQUE OF THE FILM WAS TO 
MAKE IT LIKE THAT THIS WAS 
ACTUALLY VERY MINOR ACTUALLY WE 
NOW SEE THIS IN ALL KINDS OF FILMS 
THAT LAY A CLAIM TO CURRENT 
VERISIMILITUDE BECAUSE IT IS WHAT 
PEOPLE ARE DOING WITH THEIR PHONES 
AND SMALL MOVIE CAMERAS AND SO ON 
SO IT DOES NOT ACTUALLY 
PARTICULARLY ADD ANYTHING TO THIS 
FILM 
WHAT ABOUT HER SKILLS AS A FILM DIRECTOR IT IS A VERY MACHO 
MASCULINE FILM AND YOU HAVE A YOUNG 
FEMALE DIRECTOR 
IT IS POSSIBLE 
WITH A FEMININE DIRECTOR ADDING HIS 
SENSITIVITY TO IT DOES THAT GIVE 
IT A IT AN EXTRA DIMENSION L. 
THINK WE SHOULD MENTION THE SCENES 
IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN WE SEE THAT 
WORD IN THE PAPER FOUR PEOPLE WERE 
WOUNDED THIS SHOWS WHAT THAT 
REALLY MEANS IT IS SO POIGNANT AND 
BRILLIANTLY SHOT AND SO SHOCKING 
THAT THE FILM IS WORTH SEEING FOR 
THAT ALONE 
DO YOU THINK WE SAW 
SOME OF THE THEMES WHICH WON HER 
THE FILM AWARDS IN BOYS DON'T CRY 
THE IDEA OF THE COMPLEXITY OF 
MASCULINITY FOR THE BLUE COLLAR 
WORKING CLASS MALE 
ABSOLUTELY SHE 
IS THE CHAMPION OF THE BLUE COLLAR 
WORKER OF AMERICA SHE IS GOOD AT 
FINDING A PLACE WHERE SHE CAN 
REPRESENT THOSE INTERESTS THAT ARE 
ALMOST NEVER SHOWN ON SCREEN AND 
SHE CASTS A VERY WELL TO DO THAT 
STOP LOSS CERTIFICATE FIFTEEN IS ON 
GENERAL RELEASE 
IT IS ANOTHER WAR THE FIRST WORLD 
WAR WHICH IS THE STARTING POINT 
FOR DORIS LESSING'S NEW BOOK SHE 
BELIEVES IT PLACED TERRIBLE 
BURDEN ON HER LIFE THROUGH THE 
SUFFERING OF HER PARENTS HER 
FATHER LOST LEG HER MOTHER WAS 
TRAUMATISED BY NURSING WOUNDED 
SOLDIERS SO DORIS LESSING HAD A 
DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD GROWING UP ON A 
FARM IN SOUTHERN RHODESIA WHERE HER 
PARENTS HAD EMIGRATED FAILING TO 
MAKE HOPED FOR FORTUNE IN MAIZE 
IN HER LATEST AND SHE SAYS LAST 
BOOK ALFRED AND EMILY THE NOBEL 
PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR IMAGINES A 
LIFE FOR HER PARENTS WITHOUT THE 
FIRST WORLD WAR IN FACT THEY 
NEVER EVEN MARRY EACH OTHER 
FOR A LONG TIME I KNEW I HAD NEVER 
KNOWN MY FATHER AS HE REALLY WAS 
BEFORE THE WAR IT TOOK ME YEARS TO 
SEE I HAD NOT KNOWN MY MOTHER AS 
SHE REALLY WAS EITHER SEE HER AS 
A GREAT WASTED OPPORTUNITY AND I 
ALWAYS DID EVEN WHEN I WAS A 
LITTLE GIRL ALL THIS ENERGY 
EXTRAORDINARY ENERGY GOING INTO ME 
AND MY BROTHER WHO RESENTED IT 
BITTERLY SO I HAVE GIVEN HER ROOM 
TO SPREAD HER WINGS AND SHE 
SPREADS IT INTO THE EDUCATION OF 
CHILDREN AND I HAVE GIVEN MY 
FATHER HIS HEART'S DESIRE BECAUSE 
HE WANTED TO BE FARMER IN ESSEX 
OR SUFFOLK SO THERE HE IS ALFRED 
ON THE RIDGEWAY FARM WAS WHERE 
REALLY HE HAD BEEN ALL HIS LIFE 
FROM TINY BOY HE HAD PLAYED WITH 
THE FARMERS' SONS AND OVER THE 
FARMS THE DITCHES HEDGEROWS AND 
FIELDS WERE HIS PLAYGROUND THE 
SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK IS WHAT 
THEIR LIVES ACTUALLY WORK WHICH 
WAS A HORRIBLE STORY IT IS NOT 
JUST THE FATE OF MY PARENTS IT IS 
THE WAR BOTH WARS THE OLDER I GET 
THE MORE APPALLING MAY SEEM TO ME 
I MUST HAVE TOLD YOU MY FATHER 
SAID SEEING HER SITTING THERE YES 
I AM SURE YOU DID IF THE SHRAPNEL 
HAD NOT GOT ME I WOULD HAVE DIED 
WITH THEM SOMETIMES I WONDER IT 
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER IF I HAD 
THE THING IS SAID MY FATHER 
ROUSING HIMSELF I KEEP THINKING IT 
COULD ALL HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER 
DONE DIFFERENTLY 
NATALIE THE FIRST SECTION OF THE 
BOOK WHERE DORIS LESSING RE 
EMERGENCE THE LIVES OF THEIR 
PARENTS WITHOUT THE SET WITHOUT 
THE WAR DOES THAT WORK AS PIECE 
OF FICTION 
YES IT REMINDED ME AS 
I WAS READING IT THAT REBECCA WEST 
WROTE A SAGA OF NOVELS CLOSELY 
BASED ON A REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE 
THEY WERE MUSICIANS RATHER THAN 
WRITERS BUT IT REMINDED ME OF THAT 
THESE MASSIVE POWERHOUSE FEMINISTS 
ALTHOUGH I NOTE THAT DORIS 
LESSING DOES NOT LIKE TO BE CALLED 
SUCH A THING WRITING A SWEETER 
LIGHTER HEARTED VERSION OF HER LIFE 
IT IS MUCH HAPPIER THAN THE SECOND 
HALF 
BUT SHE SHE DOES NOT MAKE HALF THEIR PARENTS' LIVES PERFECT DOES 
SHE 
NO ACTUALLY SHE IS WRONG SHE ABOUT SOMETHING SHE THINKS IT WAS 
THE WAR THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE TO 
HER PARENTS AND IT IS CLEAR THAT IT 
WAS NOT THE WAR THAT MADE THE 
DIFFERENCE TO HER MOTHER BECAUSE 
THE SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK IS 
ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED AND 
ACTUALLY HER MOTHER HAS A SERIOUS 
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN ON ARRIVING IN 
RHODESIA A PLACE WHERE SHE NEVER 
REALLY WANTED TO BE AND HAD NOT 
UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS GOING TO BE 
LIKE SO IN A WAY WHAT SHE IS 
ACTUALLY DOING IS REINVENTING 
HERSELF AND REINVENTING HER 
PARENTS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE WAR 
IN ORDER TO MAKE PEACE WITH HER 
MOTHER 
SHE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO MOTHER ACHIEVING THAT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
OF THE STYLE OF THE WRITING 
I FIND 
IT VERY INACCESSIBLE VERY 
DIFFICULT ALTHOUGH HEARING A CLIP 
OF HER READING IT SOUNDED SO MUCH 
BETTER BUT I FIND IT VERY JAGGED 
DISJOINTED IT SEEMED THAT EVERY 
SENTENCE WAS VACUUM PACKED AND 
THERE WAS BARELY A PARAGRAPH THAT 
HAD ANY HUMMER GEMAYEL TEA IN IT L. 
FOUND IT A VERY HARD READ SOME 
PAGES CONTAIN NOTHING MORE THAN A 
LIST OF BOOKS THAT SHE HAD READ 
AND THEN A FEW PAGES LATER SHE GOES 
BACK TO THAT IT FEELS THROWN 
TOGETHER 
I DID NOT FIND IT THUS L. TOGETHER ENJOYED THE PROSE L. DO NOT HOLD IT 
AGAINST SOMEBODY WHEN THEY DO A BIG 
LIST PERHAPS IT WAS NOT THE BEST 
PAGE OF ALFRED AND EMILY IN 
FAIRNESS BUT THE THING I FOUND 
MOST CONFUSING WAS THAT WE NEVER 
GET A HANDLE ON HER MOTHER L. FELT 
ALL THE WAY THROUGH READING IT THAT 
BEING A T. EIGHT SHE SHOULD MAYBE FORGIVE 
HER MOTHER BY NOW BEING EIGHTY EIGHT YEARS 
OLD THERE ARE SO MANY VERSIONS OF 
HER MOTHER SHE IS THIS SUPER 
EFFICIENT CONFIDENT NURSE AND 
THIS SOCIALITE AND SOMEBODY WITH A 
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN 
BUT IT IS MOSTLY 
HER MOTHER THAT SHE RE IMAGINES IN 
THE SECOND HALF SHE HAS A 
CONVERSATION WITH HER BROTHER SHE 
SAID HE WAS SUFFERING THAT NEED OF 
THE OLD HE NEEDED TO EXPLAIN 
SOMETHING BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE 
TELL SOMEBODY ANYBODY AS IF IT 
COULD HAVE NO REALITY UNLESS IT 
WASN'T SOMEBODY ELSE'S MIND THIS 
IS THE TRUTH SHE'S TRYING TO TELL 
ABOUT HER ABOUT THAT HER MOTHER 
ABSOLUTELY IT IS NOT A BROTHER WHO 
HAS TO TELL SOMEONE TO MAKE IT TRUE 
IT IS HER 
SHE TAKES ON BOARD WHAT 
SHOULD BE AN INTERESTING CONCEPT 
WHICH IS WHAT WHICH IS THAT IF 
ALFRIDA AND EMILY HAD NOT GOT 
MARRIED SHE AND THIS BOOK WOULD 
NOT EXIST ALFRED AND EMILY SHE 
NEVER GIVES US THE ALTERNATIVE 
HISTORY ABOUT HER OWN LIFE 
I THINK 
THAT IS BRAVE SHE COULD SO EASILY 
HAVE STUCK HERSELF BACK IN 
I THINK 
THE SECOND HALF IS ALL ABOUT HER 
COMPLETELY I END UP KNOWING 
NOTHING MORE ABOUT HER MOTHER SHE 
BECOMES MORE OPAQUE AS TIME GOES ON 
SHE DOES POP UP IN THE SECOND HALF 
AND SAY HOW DIFFICULT IT ALL IS 
SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE TOLD HER TO 
GET HELP SHE SAYS AT ONE STAGE 
THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY 
WITH BOOKS SHOULD CONFESS TO AN 
INCAPACITY TO 
READ THEM 
I CONFESS 
ALFRED AND EMILY BY DORIS LESSING

O'HARA THE TEMPESTUOUS SOUTHERN 
BELLE WHO CAN NEVER FORGET HER 
FIRST LOVE ASHLEY WILKES 
YOU ARE JEALOUS OF SOMETHING YOU 
CANNOT BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND JEALOUS JEALOUS WHY NOT DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW 
HOW MANY TIMES THAT YOU HAVE LAID 
IN MY ARMS AND IMAGINED I WAS 
ASHLEY WILKES 
WHY HAVE I DESCENDED INTO 
MINDLESS GAMES LIKE THESE 
I CAN LIVE THE LIFE I CHOOSE AND 
DO JUST AS I PLEASE 
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN HOW I AM 
PERCEIVED PERCEIVED BUT I COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED I 
WOULD EVER STAND A SADDLE AND THE 
RAIN 
TREVOR NUNN HAS AN AMAZING TRACK 
RECORD 
NOT ANY MORE A LOT OF RECORD PEOPLE CRITICS CAME OUT OF THE 
THEATRE AND WERE ASKING THEMSELVES 
IF IT WAS A HOAX ARE WE GOING TO 
WAKE UP ON FRIDAY AND THEY WILL SAY 
WE TOOK YOU IN AND THE WHOLE THING 
WAS ORGANISED BY CHRISTOPHER GUEST 
IT IS LIKE A MOVIE WHERE THEY PUT 
ON THE PAGEANT AND DO ALL OF THE 
MUSIC EXCEPT IN THIS THE MUSIC IS 
LIKE NOTHING AS PROFESSION LONG 
PROFESSIONAL IT IS THE WORST 
THEATRE THING I HAVE EVER SEEN YOU YOU REALLY DID NOT LIKE IT 
I LOVED 
BEING THERE BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS WANT 
TO TELL YOUR CHILDREN ABOUT THE 
WORST THEATRE PERFORMANCE YOU EVER 
SAW 
IN FAIRNESS TO THE PERFORMERS SAW AND THE MUSICIANS THEY ARE WORKING 
REALLY HARD WITH SOMETHING WHICH IS 
PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE THEY ARE 
DOING THEIR UTMOST WITH MUSIC WHICH 
IS SO AWFUL SO FORGETTABLE THE 
RHYMING IS SO DREADFUL OVER AND 
OVER AGAIN L. LASTED NINETY MINUTES 
BEFORE I STARTED TO LAUGH L. FEEL 
FOR THEM SO STRONGLY THE POOR 
WOMAN HAS TO STAND THERE AND SAY 
MY DREAMS HAVE GONE GONE WITH THE 
WIND DON'T MAKE CURSING THAT THE 
NARRATIVE OF IT AS THOUGH YOU 
ARE SOMEHOW RETARDED ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH DO YOU KNOW HOW I COULD 
TELL IF I WAS BLIND SOMEONE COMES 
IN AND TELLS YOU STOP TELLING ME 
WHAT I CAN SEE 
IT WAS SO 
DEPRESSING IT WAS NOT A SHOW THAT 
YOU COULD COME OUT AND LAUGH ABOUT 
AND 
HAVE THAT 
RELISH IN IT YOU 
JUST WONDER WHAT WAS IN THEIR HEAD 
DID ANYBODY THINK THIS WOULD MAKE A 
MUSICAL YOU TALK ABOUT THE MUSIC 
WHICH WAS VIRTUALLY NON EXISTENT 
AS WAS THE DANCING WHEN YOU GET 
SCARLETT O'HARA SINGING I WANTED 
TO GO TO THE BALL BUT LIKE HUMPTY 
DONATI FULL OF THE WAR DIDN'T 
SOMEONE LOOK AT THAT AND SAY THAT 
IS DREADFUL YOU ARE RIGHT TO SAY 
THAT THE CAST WORKED SO HARD TO 
WASTE THEIR TALENT IT WAS NOT AS 
THOUGH YOU COULD THINK OF WITTY 
THINGS TO SAY I JUST FELT SAD 
NEXT SEE SOME MORE 
THIS IS THE DUET BETWEEN VANCZAK 
AND I WANTED SO TO GIVE 
HE HAS GOT A WONDERFUL VOICE THERE 
IT WAS VERY GOOD I MEAN HE WAS 
CLARK GABLE'S SINGING SO HE 
OBVIOUSLY LOOKED AT CLARK GABLE IN 
THE MOVIE THEY HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN 
TOLD TO LOOK AT THE PEOPLE IN THE 
MOVIE EXCEPT FOR HIS FIRST ASHONG 
WHEN HE WAS OBVIOUSLY JEWISH 
BECAUSE IT WAS ALL ABOUT HOW YOU 
COULD MAKE MONEY IT WAS KIND OF 
FILLER ON THE ROOF AND THAT WAS 
ACTUALLY THE LEAST OFFENSIVE RACIST 
STEREOTYPE IN THE ENTIRE THING 
I THINK HE WANTED TO MAKE THE 
CHARACTERS MORAL ARBITERS 
I THINK 
HE WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT NOT BEING 
OFFENSIVE THAT IN THE END HE WAS 
JUST THAT THE FIRST SONG WAS 
BASICALLY WE ARE FREE BORN TO 
BE FREE 
BUT LOOKING AT SOME OF 
THE PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES I MEAN 
THE NARRATION WHICH I HAVE SEEN 
SCHOENFELDER DO VERY SUCCESSFULLY 
IN NICHOLAS MICKLEGATE WHEN THE 
CHARACTERS STAND UP AND TELL THE 
STORY IT IS A DIFFICULT BOOK TO 
ADAPT 
BUT SOMEBODY WILL SHOULD ADAPT SOMEBODY AND THEY WON AND THEN 
THEY WILL TURN TO THE AUDIENCE AND 
SAY I SHOT HIM THIS IS MORE LIKE 
A LADYBIRD BOOK 
LISTEN TO THIS 
THE WAR WAS OVER THE SOUTH HAD 
LOST WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF IT ALL 
I COMPLETELY AGREE 
SHE GOES I AM 
GOING TO ATLANTA IF SHE TELLS ME 
SHE'S GOING TO ATLANTA I AM GOING 
TO TAKE HER WORD FOR IT STOP 
PATRONISING ME 
AND THEN SHE HAS 
GONE FROM THE WHITE WEDDING DRESS 
TO THE BLACK ONE PEOPLE WILL THINK 
I AM FAST SHE WAS 
ARE YOU SAYING 
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A MUSICAL 
BASED ON THE FILM 
I THINK 
PERSONALLY THERE IS A RULE WHICH IS 
THAT GREAT FILMS EPIC FILMS DO 
NOT MAKE GOOD MUSICALS BECAUSE 
WHAT YOU LOSE HIS EPIC SCENERY AND 
CLOSE UPS AS WELL 
THAT'S TRUE BUT 
THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE 
AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE 
POLITICS OF IT BECAUSE THE HEROES 
IN THIS OPERA GROUP OF SLAVE OWNING 
RACISTS THAT'S THE PROBLEM WHEN 
YOU DO THE RECONSTRUCTION BOOGIE 
IN WHICH THE RECONSTRUCTION PEOPLE 
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BAD ACTUALLY 
RECONSTRUCTION WAS WHAT GAVE BLACK 
PEOPLE SOME KIND OF POLL SO YOU 
ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE SIDES ALMOST 
WITH THE K. K. K. 
IT'S NOT AS BAD AS 
THE MISOGYNY WHERE AT THE END 
SCARLETT O'HARA FEMINIST ICON GOES 
PERHAPS I'LL JUST SIT HERE AND 
BEHAVE IT CONTINUES AT THE NEW 
LONDON THEATRE 
YOU MIGHT THINK 
THAT ALEX TURNER OF THE ARCTIC 
MONKEYS HARDLY NEEDS A NEW SOUND 
ALONG WITH MILES KANE FROM THE 
RASCALS HE HAS CREATED A A NEW 
THING WITH BAND THE LAST SHADOW 
PUPPETS THEIR ALBUM THE AGE OF 
THE UNDERSTATEMENT HAS A DEFINITE 
SOUND OF THE SIXTIES 
THE AGE OF THE UNDERSTATEMENT 
THE FULLEST ATTRACTION 
GIVES ME PROPERLY 
THE ANTHONY DID YOU ENJOY HEARING 
THE SIXTIES INFLUENCE 
I THINK IT 
SHOULD BE SAID THAT MEN HAVE A 
CERTAIN AGE SHOULD NEVER PRETEND TO 
HAVE A LOVING FOR THE ARCTIC 
MONKEYS BUT I ENJOYED THIS VERY 
VERY MUCH IT DID TAKE ME BACK TO 
THE SIXTIES AND TO ALL OF THE FILMS I 
USED TO GO TO IN THE SIXTIES 
PARTICULARLY THE OPENING NUMBER 
THE AGE OF THE UNDERSTATEMENT WHEN 
I WAS EXPECTING TO HEAR THE WHIPS 
AND GUNSHOTS OF A SPAGHETTI WESTERN 
IT WAS JUST TAKING IT BACK TO WAR 
OF THE FILMS I USED TO LAUGH THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE IT IS THE 
STAGE COACH PRACTICALLY ENTERS THIS 
AND WE HAVE GOT THE TWENTY GUITAR AND 
ACTUALLY THERE ARE SEVERAL NUMBERS 
HERE WHICH ARE BRILLIANT OPENING 
TRACKS FOR ANY KIND OF SIXTIES MOVIE 
THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE L. LISTENED 
TO IT THE FIRST TIME IN QUITE LIKED 
IT AND BY THE THIRD TIME I 
THOUGHT I'M REALLY REALLY LIKE 
THIS IT MUST BE VERY UNFASHIONABLE 
THE SAME FOR ME AND I LIKED 
HEARING OF THE MUSICAL ELEMENTS DO 
YOU THINK THERE IS RISK WE ARE 
GOING DOWN THIS SIXTIES ROUTE 
I DO 
THINK THERE IS A RISK AND YET AT 
THE SAME TIME YOU CANNOT LISTEN TO 
THIS WITHOUT SEEING STEVE MCQUEEN 
IN A CAR DRIVING DOWN A COASTAL 
ROAD I LISTENED TO IT IN MY HOUSE 
HEADPHONES NOW WE'RE TALKING IT 
IS TOO INTIMATE THEN SO THE FACT 
THAT IT IS A HUGE STRINGS HUGE 
HORNS AND THEN GUITARS AS WELL IT 
MAKES PERFECT SENSE 
WITH THE 
ORCHESTRA AS WELL 
A I LOVED THE 
ENERGY IN ALL OF THIS THESE ARE 
TWO VERY YOUNG PEOPLE TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD 
AND THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY HAVING SUCH 
A LOT OF FUN EACH TAKING TURNS TO 
BE ROBBIE WILLIAMS YOU CAN NEVER 
BE SURE WHO IS TAKING THE LEAD I 
LOVED THE ENERGY AND THE YOUTH OF 
IT 
NORMALLY THESE PROJECTS HAPPEN IT WHEN THE LEAD SINGER IS OLDER AND 
JADED BUT ALEX TURNER THEY HAVE 
GOT A NEW ALBUM COMING OUT NEXT 
YEAR THE ARCTIC MONKEYS THAT'S THAT'S TRUE MY OLDEST DAUGHTER TURNS EIGHTEEN 
THIS YEAR SHE KNOWS ALL THE LYRICS 
OF ALL OF THE SIXTIES SONGS EVERY TIME 
SHE DOES THIS I FEEL A SORT OF 
COMPLIMENT TO OUR GENERATION EVEN 
THOUGH I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN A GOOD 
SONG IN MY LIFE 
THE LYRICS ARE 
REALLY INTERESTING AND GOOD THERE 
IS ONE LINE SAVE ME FROM THE 
SECATEURS IF ONLY GONE WITH THE 
WIND HAD ONE LINE IN THE ENTIRE 
SHOW AS GOOD AS THAT 
THEY HAVE 
GONE FOR THIS WHOLE KIND OF BIG 
BAND FEEL IT IS A REAL MIXTURE OF 
UNEXPECTED MUSICAL STYLES L. THINK 
SHE IF YOU LOOKED AT THE AVERAGE 
ARCTIC MONKEYS GIG AUDIENCE AND 
WONDERED HOW LIKELY THEY MIGHT BE 
TO BE FANS OF SCOTT WALKER YOU MAY 
NOT HAVE SEEN THIS TO BE AN OBVIOUS 
PROJECT BUT IN A WAY THAT IS PART 
OF ITS POWER IT IS AS IF PEOPLE 
HAVE COME OUT OF SCHOOL AT THE END 
OF TERM AND MADE SOMETHING IN THEIR 
HOLIDAYS 
SIR MORE OF THEM ARE HOLIDAYS ALMOST BETTER THAN THE BEST SONGS 
OF THE SIXTIES IN SOME STRANGE WAY 
SOME OF THEM 
THEY ARE DOING ONE 
MORE I BELIEVE AFTER THIS YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS SIXTIES WITH THE SORT OF 
TWO THOUSAND TWIST I LOVE THAT WITH A 
SORT OF TWO THOUSAND TRUST THE AGE OF THE 
UNDERSTATEMENT BY THE LAST SHADOW 
PUPPETS IS OUT NOW 
AS YOU HEARD EARLIER HUMPHREY 
LITTLETON HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY SIX 
KNOWN PRIMARILY AS JAZZ MUSICIAN 
HE WAS ALSO A CARTOONIST AT THE 
DAILY MAIL AND HE WON LEGIONS OF 
FANS AS HOST OF I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T 
A CLUE ON RADIO FOUR HE WAS WONDERFUL 
ON RADIO WITH THAT INCREDIBLY DRY 
SENSE OF HUMOUR 
THEY CALLED IT THE 
ANTIDOTE TO PANEL SHOWS IT WAS THE 
KING OF PANEL SHOWS NOTHING ELSE 
HAS NEVER COME CLOSE 
AS SOMEBODY OF HIS GENERATION WOULD 
SAY HE HAD A GOOD INNINGS 
TO LIVE 
TO EIGHTY SIX TO BE STILL GIVING PEOPLE 
ENJOYMENT WHITE UP ALMOST UNTIL THE 
END OF YOUR DAYS WHAT A FANTASTIC 
LIFE THE MAN HAD 
AND HE WAS VERY 
MUCH A FRIEND OF YOUNGER COMEDIANS 
TOO 
ABSOLUTELY HE WAS A PROPER TOO ICON TO US AND THERE AREN'T VERY 
MANY OF THEM LEFT L. HOPE B. B. C. FOUR 
DECIDE TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT HIM 
THE END HE WAS RESPECTED AS A 
MUSICIAN AS WELL 
IT INDEED L. 
UNDERSTAND THAT THE GORGEOUS 
SAMANTHA HAS ASKED THE VICAR TO GET 
HIS HEAD DOWN AND GIVE HER THE FULL 
SERVICE 
A JOKE WHICH I THINK SERVICE HUMPHREY LITTLETON HIMSELF WOULD 
APPRECIATE THANK YOU TO ALL OF MY 
GUESTS ANTHONY HOROWITZ NATALIE
