ROUTEMASTER FOR AROUND THAT PRICE 
ALSO TONIGHT 
A WARNING THAT PRISON OFFICERS AT 
BELMARSH PRISON AREN'T TRAINED TO 
STOP THE RADICALISATION OF MUSLIM 
INMATES INMATES PLUS WHY IT'S NOW EASIER THAN EVER 
FOR LONDONERS TO TAKE A TRIP DOWN 
MEMORY LANE 
AND IT'S LOOKING LOVELY OUT THERE 
A LOOK AHEAD TO THE WEATHER ALL 
TO COME FOR YOU 
A VERY GOOD EVENING TO YOU 
BORIS JOHNSON'S BUS PLANS HAVE BEEN 
A STICKING POINT THROUGHOUT HIS 
MAYORAL CAMPAIGN HE PROMISED TO 
REPLACE BENDY BUSS WITH A NEW FLEET 
OF ROUTEMASTERS BUT FOR WEEKS HE'S 
FAILED TO PUT AN EXACT PRICE ON IT 
NOW THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE HAS 
REVEALED MORE DETAILS OF THE 
POSSIBLE COSTS BUT NOT IN THE WAY 
HE INTENDED CAUGHT ON THE HOP 
WHILE CAMPAIGNING HE PUT THE 
FIGURE AT ONE HUNDRED MILLION BUT IN A 
B. B. C. DEBATE TO BE SHOWN TONIGHT HE 
FAILED TO GIVE THIS NEW FIGURE OUR 
POLITICAL EDITOR TIM DONOVAN 
REPORTS REPORTS HIS CAMPAIGN BUS IS AN OLD 
ROUTEMASTER AND HE'S PROMISED TO 
BRING IT BACK IN A NEW FORM BUT 
THE PLEDGE LOOKS IN DANGER OF 
REVERSING OVER HIM CAMPAIGNING IN 
EDGEWARE HE WAS FILMED ON A MOBILE 
PHONE BEING ASKED BY A LABOUR 
SUPPORTER HOW MUCH HIS NEW FLEET OF 
BUSES WOULD COST 
MOMENTS LATER ANXIOUS AIDES WERE 
ASKING HIM WHAT HE'D JUST SAID TO 
THE WOMAN 
WHAT I SAID I WAS 
OBLIGED SHE ASKED ME THE COST OF 
THE BUSES L. SAID IT WOULD BE ABOUT 
A HUNDRED MILLION YEAH 
SO I HAVE YEAH ALREADY SAID 
IT IS THE FIRST TIME HE'S USED THE 
ONE HUNDRED MILLION FIGURE IT SHOWS HE 
THINKS FIVE HUNDRED NEW ROUTEMASTERS WILL BE 
NEEDED TO REPLACE THE CURRENT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY 
BENDY BUSS THAT HE KNOWS WOULD 
MEAN EXTRA CONDUCTORS AND EXTRA 
DRIVERS COSTING MUCH MORE THAN THE 
EIGHT MILLION FIGURE HE'S GIVEN SO FAR 
AT B. B. C. LONDON DEBATE TO BE 
SCREENED TONIGHT HE WAS ASKED ABOUT 
THAT FIGURE 
I STICK BY OUR FIGURE 
OF EIGHT MILLION AS THE COST FOR 
YOU STICK BY EIGHT MILLION 
AS THE COST 
OF CONDUCTORS ON ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY BUT BUT THERE ARE THREE SHIFTS OF THE 
ROUTEMASTER 
WOULD YOU LET ME ROUTEMASTER FINISH OF THE COST OF CONDUCTORS 
ON THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NEW GENERATION ROUTEMASTERS 
IF YOU HAVE THREE SHIFTS IT GOES 
UP 
AT THE SAME DEBATE KEN UP LIVINGSTONE CAME UNDER FIRE FOR 
FAILING TO DO ENOUGH ABOUT TEENAGE 
KILLINGS IN THE CAPITAL AND TO 
REVERSE AN INCREASE IN VIOLENT 
CRIME 
IT WAS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND VIOLENT CRIME CRIMES A YEAR WHEN YOU BECAME MAYOR 
IT'S NOW ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND 
CRIME WAS STILL 
INCREASING BECAUSE THE POLICE FORCE 
WAS BEING DECIMATED BRIAN WILL 
CONFIRM THIS MORE POLICE WERE 
LEAVING EVERY MONTH THAN JOINING 
AS SOON AS WE GOT THEM BACK ON THE 
STREET IN TWO THOUSAND TWO TO OH THREE CRIME STARTED TO 
FALL IT'S NOW FALLING BY SIX PER CENT A YEAR 
WHICH MEANS OVER THE NEXT FOUR 
YEARS YOU COULD HAVE A TWENTY FIVE PER CENT FURTHER 
CUT IN CRIME 
BRIAN PADDICK WAS 
CHALLENGED ON HIS PLANS FOR A HUGE 
NEW TRAM NETWORK 
ON A BUSY ROUTE 
TRAMS COST LESS THAN EVEN BENDY 
BUSES 
BUT NOT THE CAPITAL COST OF BUSES BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE DON'T 
THEY TEACH YOU ECONOMICS 
YES THEY 
DO AND I AM THE ONLY ONE WITH A 
BUSINESS DEGREE SO I DON'T NEED 
LEK CLURS WITH ECONOMICS 
WITH ONLY 
TWO WEEKS TO GO EVERY PLEDGE 
EVERY CLAIM IS COMING UNDER 
INCREASING SCRUTINY 
WELL MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR SAY 
DON'T FORGET THE DEADLINE FOR 
REGISTERING TO VOTE IN THE MAYORAL 
ELECTIONS IS TOMORROW 
PLENTY MORE AHEAD BETWEEN NOW AND 
SEVEN POINT OH OH INCLUDING 
JOIN ME IN THE 
CITY WHEN I'LL BE FINDING OUT IF 
HIGH LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE IN MEN 
WHO WORK HERE COULD LEAD TO HIGH 
PROFITS FOR THE BANKS BUT ALSO 
INSTABILITY IN THE MARKETPLACE 
IT'S CLAIMED MUSLIM INMATES COULD 
BE AT RISK OF BEING RADICALISED AT 
THE HIGH SECURITY BELMARSH PRISON 
THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF PRISONS SAYS 
OFFICERS AREN'T PROPERLY TRAINED TO 
CHALLENGE EXTREMIST VIEWS WITHOUT 
ALIENATING THE LARGE NUMBER OF 
MUSLIMS THERE OUR HOME AFFAIRS 
CORRESPONDENT GUY SMITH IS HERE 
TELL US MORE GUY 
YES IT'S ONE OF 
BRITAIN'S MOST SECURE PRISONS 
BELMARSH IN SOUTH EAST LONDON WAS 
ONCE THE HOME OF I. R. A. PRISONERS IT 
NOW HOLDS THE MAJORITY OF THOSE 
AWAITING TRIAL ON CURRENT TERRORISM 
OFFENCES INCOME YOU MAY REMEMBER 
THIS MAN ABU HAMZA THE FORMER 
CLERIC OF FINSBURY PARK MOSQUE 
HE'S ALSO BEING HELD AT THE JAIL 
BUT MOST OF THE TWO HUNDRED MUSLIM INMATES 
A FIFTH OF THE PRISON POPULATION 
ARE IN FOR LESS SERIOUS CRIMES 
AND IT'S FEARED THEY ARE AT RISK OF 
BEING RADICALISED ACCORDING TO THE 
LATEST CHIEF INSPECTOR'S REPORT IT 
REVEALS THAT PRISON OFFICERS ARE 
INSUFFICIENTLY TRAINED AND NEED 
MORE SUPPORT IN HOW TO TACKLE THE 
DELICATE TASK OF TRYING TO STOP 
CONVICTED TERRORISTS RADICALISING 
OTHER BUT IT RECOGNISED THERE WAS 
SOME EXCELLENT WORK BEING DONE BY 
MUSLIM CHAPLAINS 
THE STAFF AT 
BELMARSH NEED TO BE BETTER EQUIPPED 
TO MANAGE THEIR MUSLIM POPULATION 
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY 
ANY RISKS AND BE CONFIDENT ENOUGH 
TO CHALLENGE THEM BUT THEY ALSO 
NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITHOUT 
ALIENATING THE MAJORITY OF THE 
MUSLIM POPULATION AND BEING ABLE TO 
SUPPORT THEM IN THE WAY THEY WOULD 
SUPPORT ANY OTHER PRISONERS SO SO IT'S A DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT BUT 
ANOTHER ISSUE ALTHOUGH THE MOST 
DANE ROUSE INMATES ARE IN A 
SEPARATE UNIT OTHERS CONVICTED OF 
MINOR TERRORIST OFFENCES CAN MIX 
WITH THE GENERAL PRISON POPULATION 
AND THAT POTENTIALLY IS A RISK ONE 
IMAM WHO HAS VISITED BELMARSH 
AGREES THERE'S LOT MORE WORK TO BE 
DONE TO PREVENT EXTREMIST VIEWS 
FROM SPREADING 
MORE IMAMS SHOULD 
BE BROUGHT IN SO THEY CAN ENGAGE 
WITH THIS THEM REMEMBER WHEN THEY 
COME OUT EVENTUALLY THEY WILL IF 
THEY'RE CITIZENS THEY'LL TO REHAB 
ITUATE IT'S BETTER NOW THAN LATER 
THE PRISON OFFICERS ACCEPTS THE 
PROBLEM AND ACCEPTS IT'S ONE OF 
THEIR BIGGEST CHALLENGES 
TRYING TO 
ENSURE PEOPLE FOLLOW THEIR RE 
RELIGION BUT SO THAT STAFF ARE 
AWARE WHEN THAT FLIPS OVER INTO 
SOMETHING DANGEROUS TO SOCIETY 
IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S DIFFERENT FROM 
THE BACKGROUND WE HAD WITH THE I. R. A. 
IT'S A NEW COMPLEXITY WHICH WE HAVE 
TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHILE STILL 
MAKING SURE MUSLIMS CAN FOLLOW 
THEIR RELIGION 
THE REPORT SAYS 
IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE THANKS 
TO MANAGERS AT BELMARSH PRISON BUT 
TALKING THIS AFTERNOON TO THE STAFF 
UNION THE PRISON OFFICERS 
ASSOCIATION THEY SAY IT'S NOT JUST 
MUSLIMS AT RISK OF BEING 
MARGINALISED IT'S YOUNG MEN WHO 
ARE ANGRY WHO FEEL SOCIETY DOESN'T 
WANT THEM THEY ALSO COULD BE 
ATTRACTED TO EXTREME IDEAS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWO BUSES HAVE 
BEEN FORCED TO TURN DOWN THE VOLUME 
ON A BRAND NEW P. A. SYSTEM AT EARL'S 
COURT SYSTEM KENSINGTON AND 
CHELSEA BOROUGH COUNCIL SERVED A 
NOISE ABATEMENT NOISE OF THE 
COMPUTERISED ANNOUNCEMENTS LONDON 
UNDERGROUND TRIED TO FIGHT THIS IN 
COURT BUT TODAY LOST THE APPEAL 
THEY SAY THE SYSTEM IS IMPORTANT 
FOR KEEPING PASSENGERS SAFE AND 
WILL WORK WITH THE COUNCIL TO LIMIT 
NOISE DISRUPTION 
POLICE IN ISLINGTON ARE APPEALING 
FOR INFORMATION ABOUT A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD 
GIRL WHO HAS BEEN MISSING FOR 
NEARLY THREE MONTHS MAKEBA 
SHEPPARD WAS LAST SEEN ON THE SEVENTEENTH 
OF JANUARY IT'S BELIEVED SHE COULD 
BE IN LONDON OR HERTFORDSHIRE AREA 
A MAN FROM HACKNEY HAS BEEN ORDERED 
TO PAY HIS COUNCIL THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR 
WORK TO STOP HIS HOUSE FROM 
COLLAPSING AFTER HE BUILT A SERIES 
OF TUNNELS UNDERNEATH IT WILLIAM 
LYTTLE KNOWN LOCALLY AS THE MOLE 
MAN SPENT FORTY YEARS EXCAVATING 
UNDER THE HOUSE IN MORTIMER ROAD 
BEFORE HE WAS EVICTED TWO YEARS AGO 
POLICE SAY THEY'RE INVESTIGATING 
REPORTS THAT A MAN AND A WOMAN 
KILLED ON A TRAIN TRACK IN ESSEX 
HAD BEEN ARGUING SHORTLY BEFORE 
THEY WERE HIT THE INCIDENT 
HAPPENED AT HARLOW MILL STATION 
JUST BEFORE EIGHT HUNDRED A M. THIS MORNING 
YVONNE HALL IS THERE FOR US THIS 
EVENING EVENING WELL THIS IS THE LINE WHERE THE 
TRAGEDY HAPPENED THIS MORNING 
NATIONAL EXPRESS EAST ANGLIA AND 
STANSTED EXPRESS SERVICES RUN 
THROUGH HERE THE FROM KING'S LYNN 
TO LIVERPOOL STREET POLICE ARE 
STILL INVESTIGATING THE DEATHS BUT 
WE HAVE JUST HEARD THAT THE C. C. T. V. 
FOOTAGE FROM THE TRAIN DRIVER'S CAB 
SHOW THAT THE MAN AND WOMAN WERE 
ARGUING WITH EACH OTHER AND 
STRUGGLING ON THE LINE JUST BEFORE 
THEY WERE HIT 
IT WAS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED A M. THIS MORNING 
WHEN A TRAIN TRAVELLING AT EIGHTY M. P. H. 
DOWN THIS TRACK HIT THE MAN AND 
WOMAN STANDING ON THE LINE POLICE 
ARE INVESTIGATING WHETHER IT WAS A 
DOUBLE SUICIDE OR WHETHER THE MAN 
WAS TRYING TO STOP THE WOMAN 
KILLING HERSELF 
IT APPEARS THAT 
FROM ONE WITNESS THEY HEARD RATHER 
RAISED VOICES COMING FROM THE AREA 
OF THE PLATFORM OR THE TRACKS ED A 
WHEN THEY LOOK AND WHEN THEY 
LOOKED THEY COULD SEE THIS COUPLE 
ON THE TRACKS WE DON'T KNOW BUT 
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY AND IT IS 
ONLY A POSSIBILITY AT THIS STAGE 
THAT THE MALE MAY HAVE BEEN TRYING 
TO PULL THE FEMALE AWAY FROM THE 
TRACKS BACK TO THE PLATFORM HARLOW HARLOW MILL STATION AND THIS STRETCH OF 
THE LINE BETWEEN KING'S LYNN AND 
LIVERPOOL STREET WERE CLOSED FOR 
MOST OF THE DAY WHILE POLICE 
CARRIED OUT DETAILED SEARCHES OF 
THE TRACK IDENTITIES OF THE MAN 
AND WOMAN HAVEN'T BEEN RELEASED YET 
THIS AFTERNOON THEIR BODIES WERE 
TAKEN AWAY FOR POSTMORTEM EXAMS 
THE TRAIN WAS KEPT ON THE TRACK FOR 
SEVERAL HOURS WHILE POLICE 
INVESTIGATIONS ONE PASSENGER 
DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED 
A POLICE 
OFFICER WAS WORKING HIS WAY FROM 
ONE END OF THE TRAIN TO THE OTHER 
THAT'S UP TO FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE TAKING 
NAMES AND ADDRESSS FROM EVERYBODY 
WHO WAS JUST APART FROM ANYBODY 
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE THEIR NAME 
AND ADDRESS BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE 
SO THAT IN ITSELF IS AN OPERATION 
WORKERS AT A CAR SHOWROOM NEXT TO 
THE STATION SAY THERE HAVE BEEN 
SEVERAL SIMILAR INCIDENTS IN RECENT 
MONTHS 
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE SHOCKED MONTHS EVERY TIME THIS HAPPENS WE'RE MORE 
SHOCKED 
JUST HORRIBLE ISN'T IT SHOCKED HARLOW MILL SITUATION REOPENED 
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED P. M. THIS AFTERNOON BUT 
SOME DELAYS ARE STILL EXPECTED FOR 
THE REST OF THE EVENING 
YVONNE JUST TELL US THE LATEST ON 
THOSE DELAYS AND THE TRAVEL

HAVE JUST BEEN TOLD THAT A FULL 
SERVICE IS EXPECTED TO BE RUNNING 
BY TOMORROW MORNING BACK TO YOU 
THANK YOU STAY WITH US STILL TO 
COME BEFORE SEVEN HUNDRED P. M. 
WHY FINDING OUT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY 
HISTORY IS NOW EASIER THAN EVER FOR 
LONDONERS LONDONERS AND FROM PUNK TO PAINTING I'LL BE 
TALKING TO CLASH BASSIST PAUL 
SIMONON ABOUT HIS NEW ART 
EXHIBITION EXHIBITION THEY SAY YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT BUT 
FOR SOME TEENAGERS IN LONDON WHAT 
YOU WEAR COULD ALSO HAVE AN EFFECT 
ON YOUR HEALTH NOT PHYSICALLY 
BUT MENTALLY A STUDY BY 
RESEARCHERS IN THE CAPITAL FOUND 
BANGLADESHI GIRLS WHO CHOSE 
TRADITIONAL RATHER THAN WESTERN 
DRESS HAD FEWER BEHAVIORAL AND 
EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS 
TWO BEST FRIENDS BOTH NINETEEN BOTH 
BRITISH BORN BANGLADESHIS BUT 
THERE'S CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN AYSHA BEGUM AND KOLSUMA 
BEGUM JUST LOOK AT HOW THEY'RE 
DRESSED 
FOR PEOPLE THAT WEAR DRESSED JILBABS FROM PEOPLE WHO WEAR HEAD 
TO TOE 
AYSHA BEGUM WEARS 
TRADITIONAL CLOTHES PRETTY MUCH ALL 
THE TIME AS FOR KOLSUMA BEGUM YOU 
WOULD NEVER SEE HER DRESSED LIKE 
THAT 
IT 
WAS MY CHOICE BECAUSE I THAT WAS BROUGHT UP WEARING WESTERN 
CLOTHES IT WAS MY CHOICE TO PUT ON 
THE HEADSCARF MY CHOICE WHAT THEY 
WORE MY PARENTS ARE BEHIND ME 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT I DO 
YOU HAVE 
OBVIOUSLY MADE A DIFFERENT CHOICE 
BECAUSE MY PARENTS LIKE MY MUM 
ALWAYS PUT ME IN JEANS OR DRESSES 
AND SHE NEVER PUT ME IN THE 
TRADITIONAL CLOTHING 
BUT FAR FROM 
BEING A HARMLESS CHOICE ABOUT WHAT 
THEY WEAR EXPERTS SAY IT COULD 
AFFECT THEIR MENTAL WELL BEING 
RESEARCHERS INTERVIEWED ABOUT A 
THOUSAND CHILDREN HERE IN EAST 
LONDON THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST 
ETHNICALLY DIVERSE PLACES IN THE 
ENTIRE COUNTRY THEY ASKED THEM 
THINGS ABOUT THEIR SOCIAL LIVES 
THEIR CULTURE THEN THEY CAME BACK 
TWO YEARS LATER AND ASKED THEM 
ABOUT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH THEY 
FOUND WHO YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH MAKES 
ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE WHAT YOU 
WEAR CAN HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES 
IN THE FUTURE 
THERE WAS A 
DIFFERENCE BY GENDER BOYS 
ACTUALLY HAD A LOWER RISK OF 
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IF THEY HAD 
ASSIMILATED CLOTHING IDENTITY 
WHICH MEANS IF THEY'D GIVEN UP 
THEIR CLOTHING ALTOGETHER AND 
ADOPTED THAT OF THE HOST SOCIETY 
GAVIN SPECIALISES IN CULTURAL 
DIFFERENCES HE SAYS BARRIERS NEED 
TO BE BROKEN IF CULTURES ARE TO 
LIVE ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER 
COMFORTABLY 
I SAW 
A WOMAN WEARING COMFORTABLY A HILL JONBENET IN PICCADILLY 
CIRCUS SHE FELT ABSOLUTELY 
COMFORTABLE I THINK IF HER PARENT 
SAUCE THAT SHE WOULD OBVIOUSLY HAVE 
A GO 
TOO MANY MEN WITH TOO MUCH 
TESTOSTERONE THEY'RE THE LATEST 
CULPRITS TO BE BLAMED FOR FINANCIAL 
TURMOIL IN THE CITY IT'S ALSO 
CLAIMED MORE WOMEN AND OLDER MEN 
WORKING ON THE TRADING FLOORS COULD 
HELP SETTLE THINGS DOWN IN THE 
SQUARE MILE WE CAN JOIN ASAD NOW 
WHO HOPEFULLY CAN EXPLAIN ALL 
THE STUDY IS ACTUALLY QUITE 
INTERESTING RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT 
HIGH LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE IN MEN 
WHO WORK IN THE CITY JUST BEHIND ME 
THERE GET THEM TO TAKE MORE RISKS 
AT WORK THE UPSIDE IS THEY CAN 
MAKE MORE MONEY FOR THE BANKS THAT 
THEY WORK FOR AND THE RESULTS 
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES BUT THE 
DOWNSIDE IS BY TAKING MORE RISKS 
YOU CREATE A MORE UNSTABLE MARKET 
FOR EVERYONE 
THE CITY'S WORK 
ENVIRONMENT HAS LONG BEEN A MALE 
PRESERVE AND ALTHOUGH WOMEN ARE 
STARTING TO MAKE INROADS THERE'S A 
LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THE GENDERS 
ARE BALANCED IN THE WORKPLACE BUT 
NOW THERE COULD BE A NEW INCENTIVE 
TO REDRESS THE BALANCE THAT 
INCENTIVE IS ECONOMIC STABILITY 
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE HIGHEST 
AMOUNTS OF MONEY WHICH IS MADE BY 
DEALERS IN THE CITY IS OFTEN WHEN 
MALE DEALERS HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF 
TESTOSTERONE IN THEIR BODY THAT 
MAY BE GOOD IN THE SHORT TERM BUT 
IN THE LONG TERM THERE'S CONCERN 
THAT THAT MAY CAUSE INSTABILITY IN 
THE MARKET TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
FINDINGS THESE ARE THE AVERAGE 
PROFITS OF TEN EXPERT TRADERS ON 
DAYS THEIR TESTOSTERONE LEVELS WERE 
LOW AND THIS IS HOW THEY DID ON 
HIGH TESTOSTERONE DAYS 
THE SUCCESS COMES WITH RISKS ONES ONES OF THE WAYS DEALING WITH THAT 
SOURCE OF STABILITY IS TO DIVERSIFY 
HORMONE PROFILES ON THE TRADING 
FLOOR AND WITHIN THE FINANCIAL 
SYSTEM AS WHOLE THAT TO ME WOULD 
MEAN HIRING MORE WOMEN AND OLDER 
MEN 
ON THE STREET OF THE CITY MEN WOMEN HAD THEIR OWN VIEWS OF THE 
FINDINGS 
IT'S GETTING QUITE FINDINGS BALANCED IN THE CITY ANYWAY IF YOU 
GO BACK TWENTY YEARS IT WAS A 
DIFFERENT MATTER BUT NOW IT IS A 
LOT MORE ADVANCED THINKING 
I WOULD 
SAY IT IS GOOD TO GET A GENERAL 
BALANCE IN THE WORKFORCE ANYWAY 
BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT JUST CREATING A 
BALANCE 
WOMEN CAN HELP BALANCE THE BALANCE WHOLE NATURE OF THE WORKPLACE AND 
MOST DEFINITELY YES 
A LEADING 
CITY ANALYST BELIEVES HIGH 
TESTOSTERONE LEVELS FIT WELL WITH 
THE JOB 
IF YOU ARE TRADING IN THE 
MARKET OR LOOKING AFTER CLIENT 
NEED THAT VERV THAT EXCITEMENT 
BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE THE YOUNG GUYS 
THE YOUNG TURKS WITH THE VERVE BUT 
YOU NEED SOMEONE TO CONTROL TO IT 
MAKE SURE THEY DON'T GET OUT OF 
HAND 
RESEARCHERS HOPE THEIR WORK HAND WILL LEAD TO A GREATER 
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MARKET BOOMS 
AND BUSTS CAN EXIST 
LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR THE 
RESEARCHERS AREN'T SAYING THE 
CURRENT CREDIT CRUNCH IS DOWN TO 
MEN AND THEIR TESTOSTERONE LEVELS 
AS MUCH AS WOMEN MIGHT LIKE TO 
THINK THAT IT IS BUT THEY ARE 
SAYING THAT MORE WOMEN AND OLDER 
PEOPLE WORKING IN THE CITY BEHIND 
ME THERE COULD BE A GOOD THING 
BECAUSE THEY'LL BRING MORE 
STABILITY TO THE MARKET AND JUST 
REIN THESE YOUNG TESTOSTERONE 
FUELLED MEN IN A BIT WHERE THEY 
NEED TO BE REINED IN A BIT BUT 
THEY DO SAY MORE RESEARCH HAS TO BE 
DONE IN THIS AREA TO HOPEFULLY 
AVOID BOOM AND BUST PERIODS IN THE 
FUTURE FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IF YOU'RE FASCINATED BY YOUR OWN 
FAMILY HISTORY OR THE CAPITAL'S 
PAST THEN THE LONDON METROPOLITAN 
ARCHIVE COULD MAKE YOUR RESEARCH A 
LOT EASIER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
OF POUNDS HAVE BEEN SPENT ON 
BRINGING ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S 
BIGGEST HISTORICAL RECORDS INTO THE 
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
JUST A STONE'S THROW FROM 
FARRINGDON TUBE STATION IS ONE OF 
LONDON'S MOST IMPORTANT HISTORICAL 
COLLECTIONS THERE ARE FORTY FIVE MILES OF 
SHELVINGS THERE ARE DOCUMENTS 
DATING BACK ONE THOUSAND YEARS SOME OF 
THE MOST VIEWED ARE OF THE BABIES 
LEFT AT THE FOUNDLING HOSPITAL 
THIS IS INTERESTING HERE WE HAVE A 
PLAYING CARD AS WELL AS A SCRAP OF 
FABRIC 
WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE FABRIC THEY ARE PROBABLY MOMENTOS LEFT BY 
THE MOTHER SHE IS GIVING UP HER 
CHILD FOR GOOD SHE WANTS TO LEAVE 
SOMETHING MAYBE AS A MEMORY OF HER 
AS THE CHILD GETS OLDER 
WHETHER YOU ARE RESEARCHING YOUR FAMILY OR 
FASCINATED BY THE PAST THE 
ADVANTAGE IS HERE YOU CAN LOOK AT 
THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS THIS MAN 
MAKES A LIVING BY FINDING OUT THE 
HISTORY OF PEOPLE'S HOMES 
WE COME 
HERE A LOT THERE IS A LOT OF 
INFORMATION HERE 
USING THIS 
RESOURCE IS FASTER THAN EVER 
THANKS TO A REVAMP THERE ARE MORE 
COMPUTERS AND SPACE TO WORK IN THE 
ARCHIVE ARE OPEN FIVE OR SIX DAYS A 
WEEK THEY ARE KEEN TO STRESS IT IS 
NOT ALL ANCIENT HISTORY 
WE HAVE AN 
IMPORTANT ARCHIVE WE HAVE TAKEN 
RECENTLY FROM A COUPLE WHO WERE ONE 
OF THE FOREMOST PUBLISHERS OVER THE 
PAST THIRTY YEARS 
IS THIS THEM COMING 
BACK TO YOU SAYING WE THINK WE ARE 
IMPORTANT TO BE PART OF THE ARCHIVE 
IT IS A BIT OF BOTH THE COMMUNITY 
SAYING WE WANT THIS PRESERVED AS A 
RECORD OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING 
AND MAKING SURE IT IS PRESERVED AS 
A VITAL PART OF LONDON'S HISTORY 
THAT PRESERVATION EXTENDS TO THE 
SEVENTH JULY TWO THOUSAND FIVE IF YOU ARE LOOKING 
FOR LONDON IT REALLY IS ALL HERE 
THEY ARE KEEN TO SHARE IT WITH YOU 
NOW AS BASS PLAYER FOR THE CLASH 
PAUL SIMONON WAS ONE OF THE 
PIONEERS OF PUNK HE MOVED FROM 
GIGS TO GALLERIES MAKING A NAME 
FOR HIMSELF AS AN ARTIST HE IS 
EXHIT BITHING IN LONDON FOR THE 
FIRST TIME EXHIBITING IN LONDON 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX YEARS 
SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO 
HE WAS PART OF THE PUNK MOVEMENT 
THAT ROCKED THE SEVENTIES AND THE KASBAR 
BEFORE HE FOUND MUSIC FAME PAUL 
SIMONON WAS STUDYING AT ART COLLEGE 
IN NOTTING HILL YOU BEING AN 
ARTIST HELPED GET YOU INTO THE 
CLASH 
MICK BEING VERY UP ON HIS CLASH POP HISTORY HE WAS AWARE OF AN 
ARTIST CALLED STUART SUTCLIFF HE 
PROBABLY SAW AN ELEMENT OF THAT IN 
ME SO HE DID ANNOUNCE THIS IS MY 
BASS PLAYER HE CANNOT PLAY A NOTE 
BUT HE IS A GREAT PAINTER 
THIS NEW 
COLLECTION TAKES INSPIRATION FROM A 
SPANISH BULLFIGHT THAT PAUL WENT TO 
IN TWO THOUSAND THREE IT IS A NEW DIRECTION FOR 
HIM AS HE MOVES AWAY FROM THE 
LONDON LANDSCAPES 
I READ SOMETHING 
THAT A PAINTER SAID ABOUT REACTING 
TO THINGS WHICH ARE IN ON YOUR OWN 
DOORSTEP I SUPPOSE IT IS 
INTERESTING THAT BECAUSE IN THE 
CLASH WE WROTE INITIALLY ABOUT WHAT 
WAS ON OUR OWN DOORSTEP IN SO FAR 
AS MY PAINTING REFLECTS THAT TOO 
INTEREST IN HIS WORK IS REFLECTED 
IN THE PRICES YOU CAN EXPECT TO 
PAY ANYTHING BETWEEN FIVE THOUSAND TO THIRTY THOUSAND 
FOR A PIECE OF HIS ART THE THING 
IS THEY ARE THEY HAVE PASSED 
CERTAIN TEST FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO 
LOVE THE STUDIO AM QUITE HARSH 
CRITIC OF MY OWN WORK L. L. THINK YOU 
NEED TO BE REALLY OTHERWISE YOU 
MIGHT AS WELL SELL THEM DOWN A 
MARKET REALLY HIS NEW PAINTINGS 
WILL BE ON DISPLAY AT THE THOMAS 
WILLIAMS FINE ART GALLERY FROM THIS 
THURSDAY 
THE SKY IS NOT LOOKING SO SPLENDID 
AS IT DID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
PROGRAMME MUCH GREYER CLOUDS NOW 
ACROSS LONDON AT LUNCH TIME WE HAD 
THINGS WHICH LOOKED LIKE SCOTTISH 
PANCAKES NOW THEY ARE MUCH MORE 
THREATENING AND THEY HAVE CALLY 
FLOWERS ON TOP OF THEM IT WILL NOT 
BE LONG BEFORE THEY PRODUCE SHOWERS 
SOME OF THE SHOWERS COULD TURN OUT 
TO BE QUITE HEAVY SUPPOSE THERE 
IS A CHANCE OF RUMBLE OF THUNDER 
PERHAPS FLASH OF LIGHTNING OVER 
THE TOPS OF THE CHILTERNS FOR A 
TIME THE SHOWERS MORE WIDESPREAD 
OVERNIGHT WITH LOT OF CLOUD AND 
RAIN IT WILL NOT BE AS COLD AS LAST 
NIGHT NO FROST WE ARE LOOKING AT 
TEMPERATURES SOMETHING AROUND THREE 
FIVE CELSIUS IN THE MORNING THERE 
COULD BE FOG IN RURAL 
BUCKINGHAMSHIRE IF THERE ARE ANY 
SHOWERS LINGERING IN THE MORNING 
THEY WILL GET PUSHED AWAY FROM US 
BY A FRESHENING EASTERLY WIND THAT 
WILL BRING BRIGHTER SKIES BY THE 
AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
DOWN ON TODAY'S WITH THAT BREEZE 
DESPITE THE SUNSHINE I THINK WE 
WILL NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE IT WILL 
FEEL BIT COLDER THAT EASTERLY 
BREEZE WILL BE WITH US FOR THE REST 
OF THE WEEK IT WILL BRING A BIT OF 
CLOUD TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF 
LONDON ON THURSDAY THAT CLOUD 
MIGHT PRODUCE SOME RAIN FROM 
LONDON DOWN INTO SURREY THAT IS 
WHERE YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO SEE 
BREAK IN THE CLOUD SUNSHINE 
BREAKING THROUGH THEN ON FRIDAY 
SOME WET WEATHER MOVING FRUP THE 
SOUTH COAST WITH ANY LUCK WE MIGHT 
SEE SOME BRIGHTER SKIES TO THE 
SOUTH OF LONDON LATER ON IN THE DAY 
SO A CHANGE FOR THE OUTLOOK A 
CHANGE TO AN EASTERLY WIND WHICH 
WILL MAKE IT FEEL COLDER 
EVENTUALLY IT WILL BRING US WET 
WEATHER ON FRIDAY 
THANK YOU NOW JUST BEFORE WE GO
