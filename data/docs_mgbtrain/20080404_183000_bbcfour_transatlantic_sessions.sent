WELCOME TO THE TRANSATLANTIC SESSIONS 
THE BEST OF NASHVILLE IRELAND AND SCOTLAND A HIGHLAND LOCATION ALL TO OURSELVES 
IT'S BEEN CALLED THE GREATEST BACK PORCH SHOW EVER AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR 
IN ACTUAL FACT WE'RE DOING SOMETIMES 
FIVE RECORDINGS A DAY 
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANY OF THEM SO 
AND THAT'S 
THAT'S WITH EVERYBODY LEARNING THE SOUND PEOPLE MUSICIANS EVERYBODY 
WE'RE A LITTLE REHEARSED WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY UNREHEARSED 
BUT WE LIKE TO LEAVE SOME OF THE BARK ON THE TREE 
WHOOPEE 
ALTHOUGH THERE'S VERY LITTLE TIME YOU MIGHT JUST BE THROWN IN A ROOM 
AND HAVE HALF AN HOUR TO WORK SOMETHING OUT WITH THE SONG 
I THINK THAT IN A WAY WE ALL SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE 
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MELODIES AND THE SONGS IN THE FIRST PLACE 
CALLING ALL OLIVE BRANCHES 
AND LAID OFF DOVES 
THERE IS WORK TO DO 
BEFORE WE SAY GOOD BYE 
AND WHO CAN SEE THEM TURNING TO THE FACE OF LOVE 
THOUGH I HEAR THEM PLEADING WITH ME 
DON'T LET US DIE 
AS I SIT I CAN HEAR THE TROUBLED SOULS WANDER BY 
AND I FEEL THEM 
LEANING ON MY SHOULDER TO CRY 
OH ONE MORE CHANCE 
NAKED TREE OF WINTER 
SEEMS TO STAND SO PROUD 
LORDING THE POOR MORTAL AS HE GOES 
AND THE TEARS WHICH WELL 
BENEATH THE SOMBRE SHROUD 
WILL THEY FALL WITH THE SHAME 
OF SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS 
HE CAN NEVER BE 
LIKE THE THOUGHT OF A ROSE 
WHOSE BEAUTY REMAINS 
EVEN WHEN THE BLOOM GOES 
OH ONE MORE CHANCE 
OR IS IT TOO LATE 
TO CHANGE THE WAY 
WE'RE BOUND TO GO 
OR IS IT TOO LA ATE 
SURELY ONE OF US MUST KNO OW 
OR IS IT TOO LA ATE 
TO CHANGE THE WAY 
WE'RE BOUND TO GO 
OR IS IT TOO LA ATE 
SURELY ONE OF US MUST KNO OW 
IS IT TOO LA ATE 
IS IT TOO LA ATE 
IS IT TOO LA ATE 
WILL WE JUST GIVE IT A WEE PLAY THEN YEAH LET'S PLAY IT 
I TOOK PART IN THE TALL SHIPS RACE IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE SAILING AROUND BRITAIN 
AND I WROTE THIS TUNE WHEN WE WERE LEAVING THE SOUTH TIP OF SHETLAND 
WE WERE SITTING ON DECK AND FOR ME PLAYING THE HARP 
THE BACK OF THE HARP IS ALMOST BUILT LIKE A BOAT 
AND SITTING ON THE DECK OF THE BOAT 
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THE BOAT BECAME THE EXTRA SOUND BOX OF THE HARP 
YOU COULD HAVE SAID NO 
INSTEAD OF JUST GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS 
HOW FAR WILL YOU GO WITH THIS 
OVER THE TOP DEVOTION 
THE ROAD OF LEAST RESISTANCE 
WON'T TAKE OUR LOVE THE DISTANCE 
BABY IT'S NO GOOD FOR ME 
UNLESS YOU FIGHT FOR ALL YOU CAN BE 
IF YOU SEE YOURSELF AS SMALL 
THEN THAT'S HOW TALL YOU WILL BE 
YOU CAN'T MEASURE UP AT ALL 
IF YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO PLEASE ME 
DON'T TRY TO PLEASE ME 
SO TAKE A BIG BREATH 
IT'S YOUR SPACE AS MUCH AS MINE YEAH 
WE'RE AT OUR BEST 
WHEN WE'RE LAYING IT ON THE LINE YEAH 
I DON'T NEED NO CUSHION 
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU'RE PUSHIN' 
COS BABY WHEN YOU'RE FEELING STRONG 
THAT'S WHAT REALLY TURNS ME ON 
IF YOU SEE YOURSELF AS SMALL 
THEN THAT'S HOW TALL YOU WILL BE 
YOU CAN'T MEASURE UP AT ALL 
IF YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO PLEASE ME 
DON'T TRY 
DON'T 
YOU CAN'T MEASURE UP AT ALL 
IF YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO PLEASE ME 
DON'T TRY TO PLEASE ME 
DON'T TRY TO PLEASE ME 
DON'T TRY

THIS MAY BE OUR LAST GOODNIGHT TOGETHER 
WE MAY NEVER PASS THIS WAY AGAIN 
JUST LET ME ENJOY IT TILL IT'S OVER 
OR FOREVER 
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME 
HOW THE STORY ENDS 
SEE THE WAY OUR SHADOWS COME TOGETHER 
SOFTER THAN YOUR FINGERS ON MY SKIN 
SOMEDAY THIS MAY BE ALL 
WE REMEMBER OF EACH OTHER 
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME HOW THE STORY ENDS 
NEVER'S JUST THE ECHO OF FOREVER 
LONESOME AS A LOVE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
LET ME GO ON LOVING AND BELIEVING 
TILL IT'S OVER 
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME HOW THE STORY ENDS 
NEVER'S JUST THE ECHO OF FOREVER 
LONESOME AS A LOVE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
LET ME GO ON LOVING AND BELIEVING 
TILL IT'S OVER 
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME HOW THE STORY ENDS 
OH PLEASE DON'T TELL ME HOW THE STORY ENDS 
FOLK MUSIC IS THE LANGUAGE OF PEOPLE WHO CAME FROM ALL DIFFERENT PLACES 
WHEREVER THEY ENDED UP IT ALL BECAME A STEW 
SO WE CERTAINLY HAD PLENTY OF PEOPLE FROM BRITAIN AND IRELAND 
COMING OVER TO THE U. S. FOR CENTURIES AND MUSIC COMES WITH THEM 
IT GETS INTEGRATED INTO THE CULTURE AND THE DAILY LIVES OF PEOPLE
