LIZ YELLING IT IS A BIG DAY THE 
CHANCE TO GO TO THE BEIJING

LOOKS AS THOUGH IT IS A RACE 
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM 
LET'S FIND OUT HOW LIZ AND HAYLEY 
HAINING ARE APPROACHING THE RACE 
THIS HAS TO BE MY BEST PERFORMANCE 
IT IS THE OLYMPIC TRIALS L. THINK 
ANY OTHER GIRL OUT THERE IS ALSO 
KNOW IT IS THE OLYMPIC TRIALS L. 
HAVE TO PUT IN A GOOD PERFORMANCE 
SO I COULD SECURE OLYMPIC SELECTION 
IF I DON'T SOMEONE ELSE LFPLT IT IS 
CUT THROAT BUT AT LEAST YOU KNOW 
WHERE YOU STAND L. HAVE BEEN 
PREPARING FOR THAT L. KNOW THAT'S 
WHAT IS REQUIRED SO AT LEAST I 
KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO ON THE DAY 
I'M READY FOR IT 
SO I WANT THAT PLACE REALLY 
BADLY SO I'M GOING TO GIVE IT MY 
BEST SHOT 
I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE I'M IN THIS 
SITUATION I ONLY STARTED BACK IN 
ATHLETICS THREE YEARS AGO LONDON 
WAS MY FERST MARATHON THAT TOOK ME 
TO THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS AND THE 
COMMONWEALTH GAMES OVER THE LAST 
FEW YEARS I'VE BROUGHT MY TIME 
DOWN AND IN BERLIN I GOT THE 
STANDARDS FOR THE OLYMPICS TO BE IN 
THE SITUATION IS INCREDIBLE FOR ME 
I WANT TO GO OUT THERE AND GIVE IT 
MY BEST SHOT AND TRY NOT TO GET TOO 
CAUGHT UP WITH THE PRESSURE AND 
EVERYTHING IT IS A GREAT DAY AND A 
GREAT RACE AND TRY TO KEEP THAT IN 
MIND WHEN I'M RUNNING ROUND 
THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WOMENS ELITE RACE ABOUT TO 
GET UNDER WAY A FEW MINUTES TO THE 
START OF WHAT WILL BE A VERY 
IMPORTANT RACE MUCH NOT ONLY FOR 
THE BRITISH ATHELETES BUT MANY OF 
THE INTERNATIONAL CONTINGENT 
LOOKING FOR SELECTION IN THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES AS WELL AS A GOOD 
PERFORMANCE HERE IN THIS YEAR'S 
LONDONS MARATHON 
PAULA RADCLIFFE 
WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE BEEN HERE 
INJURY KEEPS HER AWAY OTHER OF THE 
WORLD'S BIG NAMES PRAMS FOCUSING ON 
BEIJING WE HAVE A STELLA FIELD HERE 
IN LONDON ONCE AGAIN CERTAINLY ONE 
OR TWO PEOPLE WILL BE HOPING TODAY 
GIVE THEM SOME INDICATION 
CAN GIVE THEM SOME INDICATION GUIDANCE AS TO THEIR MEDAL 
PROSPECTS IN THE SUMMER OF COURSE 
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONDITIONS IN 
BEIJING TO WHAT THEY WILL FACE 
TODAY IN LONDON IT IS A BRIGHT 
COOL DAY PERFECT CONDITIONS FOR 
RUNNING THE MARATHON DISTANCE 
ADERE ONE OF THE FAVOURITES SHE 
SAID SHE HASN'T MADE UP HER MIND 
WHETHER TO TAKE ON THIS EVENT IN 
BEIJING TOT WILL HELP HER MAKE 
THAT DECISION ON THE FASTEST WOMEN 
IN THE WORLD PETROVA WHO RUNS SO 
WELL THE RUSSIAN LAST FIVE YEARS 
HERE IN LONDON HAS FINISHED IN THE 
TOP FIVE POSITIONS 
PERHAPS THE PRE RACE FAVOURITE 
WORLD CHARP YON ON THE TRACK 
CROSS COUNTRY CROSS COUNTRY CHAMPION NOW ONE OF THE WORLD'S 
BEST MARATHON RUNNERS GETE W. A. M. I. 
KOSGEI FORMER COMMONWEALTH CHAMPION 
ON THE TRACK OUTSIDE THE TOP THREE 
HERE IN LONDON LAST YEAR AIT SALEM REPRESENTING ALGERIA WITH 
A NEW ALGERIAN RECORD OF THE HALF 
MARATHON DISTANCE SETTING HER UP IN 
GOOD STEAD FOR TODAY'S RACE LIZ 
YELLING A BIG CHEER FROM THE HOME 
CROWD FOR LIZ YELLING THIS IS HER 
CHANCE TO REALLY PUSH HERSELF 
FORWARD A WORLD CLASS MARATHON 
RUNNER THE NORMAL START DOWN AT BLACKHEATH 
WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED 
ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO OF COURSE WHEN LONDON 
HELD THE OLYMPIC MARATHON THAT IS 
WHEN DISTANCE WAS SET AS THE 
STANDARD FOR THE WHOLE WORLD TO 
COMPETE WHETHER YOU ARE AN LEET 
ATHLETE OR ONE OF THE THOUSANDS 
THAT WILL TAKE PART IN THE MASS 
RACE A LITTLE LATER FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
TIME NOW WE CONCENTRATE ON THE 
WOMENS ELITE RACE WELL THE FLORA WOMEN'S LONDON 
MARATHON GETTING UNDER WAY WITH A 
RATHER PATHETIC STARTER'S HORN 
THERE I AM SURE THAT WILL NOT HAVE 
BEEN 
THAT'S NOT VERY NICE BEEN STEVE PATHETIC IT WAS YOUR FRIEND 
SEBASTION COE PROVIDING THE SOUND 
TO START THE RACE THERE THEY ARE 
ON THEIR WAY AN INTERESTING 
POTENTIAL FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
LATER THIS YEAR FOR THE BRITISH 
ATHLETES BUT OVERALL A BEAUTIFUL 
OPENING HERE THE WEATHER'S BEEN 
KIND TO THE ATHLETES IT'S COOL 
WHICH IS MUCH TO THEIR ADVANTAGE A 
FAIRLY LARGE WOMEN'S ELITE FIELD 
HERE PACE MAKERS IN THERE TO 
ENSURE A GOOD PACE AND A GOOD 
OVERALL TIME BUT FOR THE MOMENT 
IT'S JUST SETTLED DOWN GETTING 
AMONGST THEM SEE LIZ YELLING EARLY 
ON IN HER GREAT BRITAIN STRIP 
ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING LIZ CLOSE TO 
THE FRONT OF RACES AS WE SAW A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IN EDINBURGH 
SHE LED FOR A WHILE WE DON'T WANT 
HER LEADING HERE TODAY SHE'S GOING 
TO HAVE A GOOD RACE BETWEEN HERSELF 
AND A COUPLE OF PLACES BEHIND HER 
IN THE YELLOW VEST THAT'S HAYLEY 
HAINING THE SCOTTISH ATHLETE 
THERE THE CLUB RUNNERS THE COUNTY 
CLASS RUNNERS AND THESE RUNNERS 
OVERALL TOP CLASS RUNNERS IN THEIR 
OWN RIGHT AND GOOD TIMES WILL BE 
ENSURED I AM SURE BECAUSE OF THE 
WAY THE RACE IS SET UP AND THE 
FIELD IS SET UP 
ONE THING WE SHOULD POINT OUT AT 
THE BEGINNING IS WE ARE HOPING FOR 
A FAST RACE AS BRENDAN SAID IT 
WILL BE WITHOUT PACE MAKERS THERE 
WAS TALK AS TO WHAT PACE MIGHT BE 
REQUIRED BY THE ATHLETES AT THE 
FRONT AND THE BRITISH ATHLETES 
PERHAPS FURTHER BACK WHETHER THEY 
WANTED THEIR OWN PACE MAKERS BUT 
THEY'VE BEEN DISPENSED WITH SO 
THIS IS VERY MUCH A CLEAN RACE IN 
TERMS OF TACTICS THEY WILL HAVE TO 
DECIDE THEMSELVES HOW THEY WANT TO 
RUN CONSTANTINA TOMESCU DITA JUST 
IN THE FRONT THERE ON THE RIGHT OF 
THE SCREEN AS YOU LOOK AT IT 
FAIRLY COMMITTED NATURAL 
FRONTRUNNER OVER THE YEARS BUT 
EARLY STAGES HERE OF COURSE 
WITHOUT PACE MAKERS IN THE EARLY 
STAGES IT WILL I AM SURE HAVE 
SOME EFFECT ON HOW THIS IS RUN 
WHICH MIGHT HELP THE BRITISH 
ATHLETES PARTICULARLY LIZ YELLING 
SHE WAS HOPING TO BE INVOLVED AS 
MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN THE EARLY 
STAGES THERE IS LIZ YELLING THERE 
BRENDAN MENTIONED HAYLEY HAINING I 
THINK SHE PERHAPS WILL HAVE 
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TACTICS TO LIZ 
VERY MUCH SHE SAID KNOWS WHAT TIME 
SHE THINKS SHE CAN RUN 
SHE IS GOING TO RUN HER OWN RACE 
KNOWS WHAT TIME SHE THINKS SHE CAN 
RUN AND IF LIZ IS GOING FASTER 
THEN THAT'S GOOD LUCK TO LIZ BUT 
SHE WILL HOPE THAT HER TACTICS 
PROVE TO BE RIGHT ON THE DAY AS WE 
SAID AT THE BEGINNING IT LOOKS AS 
THOUGH JUST ONE SPOT AVAILABLE AS 
LONG AS MARA YAMAUCHI AND PAULA 
RADCLIFFE STAY FIT REMEMBER IF YOU CAN BACK TO TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
WHEN WE LAST HAD ATHLETES RUNNING 
FOR A PLACE IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
AND ON THAT DAY WE HAD ALMOST 
COMPLETE UNKNOWN CAME THROUGH 
TRACEY MORRIS CAME THROUGH AND GOT 
HERSELF INTO SELECTION POSITION 
TRACEY WHO HAD BEEN HOPING TO BE 
HERE TODAY AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND 
IT HAS HAD ONE OR TWO INJURIES 
PROBLEMS AND I THINK HAS HAD A 
CRACKED RIB RECENTLY AND NOT HERE 
TO PUT IN HER OWN CHALLENGE 
THINK EVERYONE WAS ACCEPTING COMING 
INTO TODAY IT WAS VERY MUCH BETWEEN 
LIZ YELLING AND HAYLEY HAINING 
NATALIE HARVEY TODAY RUNNING HER 
FIRST MARATHON YOU NEVER KNOW ONE 
OR TWO OF THE OTHER LESS FANCIED 
BRITISH RUNNERS MIGHT PRODUCE 
SOMETHING SPECIAL 
VERY INTERESTING RACE I THINK 
BRENDAN IN TERMS OF LOOKING 
FORWARD TO THE OLYMPICS AND THE 
LIKES OF GETA W. A. M. I. THINK THIS IS 
ABOUT HER FIFTH MARATHON IN A TWELVE 
MONTH PERIOD AND ADERE IS NOT SURE 
WHETHER SHE WANTS TO GO TO BEIJING 
TODAY IS GOING TO TELL US A LOT 
IT'S AN IMPORTANT RACE FROM MANY 
POINTS OF VIEW L. PREFER THESE 
RACES WITHOUT PACE MAKERS 
CONSTANTINA TOMESCU DITA ON THE 
INSIDE NATURALLY RUNS IN THE FRONT 
ENJOYS COMPETING LIKE THAT AND 
THESE ATHLETES ARE HERE FOR A 
COMPETITIVE RACE RATHER THAN A 
TIMED RACE SOMETIMES OVERALL YOU 
GET A MORE SENSIBLE APPROACH WHEN 
YOU GET THAT KIND OF LACK OF PACE 
MAKERS MAKERS JUST ANOTHER NAME TO PICK OUT THERE 
IRINA MIKITENKO OF GERMANY ONLY 
RUN ONCE RAN WELL ON HOME SOIL IN 
PWER LAIN LAST YEAR IN PWER LAIN 
LAST YEAR BERLIN LAST YEAR SHE 
SHE HAS BEEN IN GOOD FORM MANY OF 
THESE ATHLETES HAVE RUN A COUPLE OF 
HAR MARATHONS RECENTLY LIZ YELLING 
CHOSE TO TRAIN HERE AT THE U. K. 
ALSO THE OTHERS HAVE POPPED UP 
AROUND EUROPE WITH SOME PRETTY 
QUICK TIMES TO THEIR NAMES 
IRINA MIKITENKO ONE OF THOSE 
RUNNING IN GERMANY SHE MIGHT BE 
ONE TO WATCH TODAY 
YOU JUST GET THE FEELING THE 
EXPERIENCE WILL CERTAINLY TELL AND 
PETROVA WE LOOKED AT THE RUSSIANS 
THEY KNOW THIS COURSE SO WELL THE 
RUSSIANS AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN 
THERE OR THEREABOUTS 
MAKER OR THE ACTING PACE MAKER HAS 
BEEN INVITED TO TAKE THE LEAD 
WELL YOU CAN STAY WITH US HERE ON 
B. B. C. ONE IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW EITHER 
OF THE ELITE RACES YOU CAN BY 
PRESSING THE RED BUTTON FOLLOWING 
THE WOMEN'S RACE WILL BE ED HARRY 
OR STAY WITH US HERE AS I SAID ON 
B. B. C. ONE B. B. C. ONE I HAVE TO SAY THAT IF YOU ARE 
DRESSED AS A LION AT THE FRONT OF 
THE START LINE YOU MAY WANT TO 
THINK AGAIN BECAUSE BEHIND YOU WILL 
BE SIX MASAI WARRIORS HERE THEY

KNOW YOU ARE TRYING TO RAISE MONEY 
FOR A WATER PLY IN YOUR VILLAGE

COME HERE TO RUN THE LONDON 
MARATHON 
GREENFORCE ORGANISATION MARATHON VERY ABOUT BEEN WORKING WITH US AND

CAN DO THE MARATHON IF YOU WEREN'T 
STOPPING TO ENTERTAIN THE CROWDS I I THINK IT WILL BE VERY VERY QUICK 
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE WATCH TO TIME 
OR ANYTHING AT HOME WE CAN DO VERY 
FAST

GOOD LUCK 
IF YOU ARE A MARATHON FAN AND YOU 
ARE UNDER EIGHTEEN THEN THIS IS THE PLACE 
TO BE IN THE HEART OF THE CITY OF 
LONDON WHERE THIS YEAR'S MINI 
MARATHON IS STARTING IF YOU HEAR 
THE NAME MINI MARATHON YOU MIGHT 
THINK THIS IS A FUN EVENT IT'S 
ACTUALLY THE U. K.'S TOP THREE MILE 
ROAD RACE FOR LEN TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS 
AND THERE ARE SERIOUSLY TALENTED 
YOUNG ATHLETES HERE IT'S ALSO NOT 
JUST ONE RACE THERE ARE EIGHT 
RACES IN TOTAL INCLUDING TWO FOR 
WHEELCHAIR ATHLETES AND THE MAN 
WHOSE JOB IT IS TO START THEM OFF 
IS NONE OTHER THAN THE WORLD INDOOR 
TRIPLE JUMP CHAMPION IS THAT 
MARATHON HAIR 
I THOUGHT I WOULD GO 
WITH A DIFFERENT COLOUR TODAY DID DID YOU EVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHEN 
YOU WERE A KID 
I COULDN'T RUN THAT 
FAR 
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO DO FAR SPRINT TRAINING DO YOU DO LONG 
DISTANCE 
I COULD PROBABLY MAKE IT DISTANCE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED METRES AND THAT'S ABOUT 
IT IT OBVIOUSLY GOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 
BEIJING HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT 
IT 
I AM POSITIVE THE YEAR'S BEEN IT TKPWAOG WELL UNBEATEN SO FAR AND I 
WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY UP UNTIL 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
GOING REALLY 
WELL UNDERSTATEMENT AS YOU ARE THE 
WORLD INTKAOPB TRIPLE JUMP T. R. P. THE MINI LONDON MARATHON IS 
STARTING AT BILLINGSGATE SO THE 
COURSE HAS BEEN EXTENDED FROM TWO 
AND A HALF TO THREE MILES 
CERTAINLY THERE HAS HAS BEEN A 
BREEDING GROUND IN THE PAST FOR 
GREAT CHAMPIONS AS FAR AS THE 
WHEELCHAIRS ARE CONCERNED YOUNG 
MICKEY BUSHELL IS OUT THERE AGAIN 
AND EXPECTED TO DO WELL 
WELL INTERESTING THAT THE FRONT OF 
THE WOMEN'S ELITE RACE HAYLEY 
HAINING HAS DECIDED AFTER A SLOW 
FIRST MILE SHE WANTED TO MOVE 
THINGS ALONG A LITTLE BIT GETTING 
SOME HELP THE PACE WAS SO SLOW 
BUT THEN THE THIRD MILE PICKED UP 
PACE THAT FIRST MILE EXCEPTIONALLY 
SLOW NOT TO THE LIKING OF HAYLEY 
HAINING WHEN YOU COME IN WITH A 
RACE PLAN NOTHING WORSE THAN 
SETTING OFF MUCH SLOWER THAN YOU 
HAD INTENDED AND I AM USING YOUR 
MIC I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU SO YOU 
CAN TALK 
THANKS STEVE YES I 
THINK THE INTERESTING THING THERE 
WAS THE FACT THAT THE FIRST MILE 
WAS SO SLOW THE BRITISH ATHLETES 
ARE IN GOOD SHAPE THEY KNOW THIS 
IS A DAY WHEN THEY CAN GET NOT 
ONLY RUN FOR A QUALIFICATION FOR 
THE OLYMPICS IN BEIJING WILL YOU 
ALSO BUT ALSO RUN PERSONAL BEST 
TIMES DEFINITELY LIZ YELLING IS 
CAPABLE OF FASTER THAN THAT HAYLEY 
HAINING IS ALSO CAPABLE OF BEING 
FASTER THE OPPORTUNITY TO RUN THAT 
FAST TIME WAS BEGINNING TO SLIP 
AWAY AFTER THAT FIRST MILE 
MICHELLE ROSS COPE DID THEM A 
FAVOUR GOT THE PACE MOVING ALONG 
CONSTANTINA TOMESCU DITA NOW 
FORMER WORLD HALF MARATHON CHAMPION 
AND ON THIS SIDE IRINA MIKITENKO 
OF GERMANY BOTH OF THEM RESPONDING 
LIZ YELLING IN THE MIDDLE RUNNING 
STRONGLY COMFORTABLY AND BEHIND 
THEM HAYLEY HAINING SO NOW THE 
RACE IS GOING MORE THE WAY THAT THE 
BRITISH ATHLETES WERE LOOKING FOR 
AS WE LOOK ON THE INSIDE IN THE 
YELLOW VEST WITH GREEN SHORTS 
THAT'S BERHANE ADERE FORMER WORLD 
HALF MARATHON CHAMPION THE ELIGHTS 
ARE BEGINNING TO MOVE TO THE FRONT 
THE TWO IN THE LEAD BOTH FORMER 
CHAMPIONS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT BOTH 
FORMER WORLD CHAMPIONS IN THEIR OWN 
RIGHT AND AS I LOOK DOWN THE FIELD 
IN THE RED AND WHITE VEST THE TINY 
FIGURE OF GETA W. A. M. I. SHE IS TAKING 
A CLOSER ORDER AS SHE SEES BERHANE 
ADERE MOVING ALONGSIDE TOO 
NOW JANE TOMLINSONS WITH HUGE 
INSPIRATION TO ALL OF US SHE WAS 
DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER WITH JUST 
MONTHS TO LIVE SADLY JANE LOST HER 
FIGHT LAST YEAR HER HUSBAND MIKE 
AND HER DAUGHTER REBECCA ARE 
RUNNING THE MARATHON TODAY MIKE 
YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY CARRYING ON WHAT 
JANE STARTED 
YEAH JANE STARTED 
PRETTY MUCH THE FUNDRAISING SIX 
YEARS AGO ALMOST TO THE DAY HERE 
TODAY AND WE ARE CARRYING ON IN THE 
SAME VEIN 
SHE WAS SUCH AN AMAZING 
PERSON EXTRAORDINARY DID IT 
SURPRISE YOU WHAT SHE TOOK ON AND 
HOW SHE WAS BECAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY 
SAW HOW POORLY SHE WAS 
IT DIDN'T 
SURPRISE ME HER RESILIENCE WHAT 
SURPRISED ME WAS THE ENDURANCE 
EVENTS AND WE SEEMED TO GO FROM ONE 
TO ANOTHER AND ENDED UP OBVIOUSLY 
DOING THE IRON MAN WHICH WAS 
ASTONISHING AND I CAN'T IT'S HARD 
TO SUM UP INTO WORDS THE FEELINGS 
FOR JANE BECAUSE SHE WAS SUCH THE 
MOST ASTONISHING PERSON 
ALSO JUST 
HELPED SO MANY PEOPLE AND IS 
CONTINUING TO HELP SO MANY PEOPLE 
WAS SHE SURPRISED BY THE REACTION 
THAT SHE GOT ALL THE WAY AROUND THE 
WORLD 
YEAH AND WOULD HAVE BEEN WORLD EVEN MORE SURPRISED AFTER SHE DIED 
SHE CAME HERE SIX YEARS AGO AND 
SAID SHE WAS RUNNING TO SHOW PEOPLE 
THAT PEOPLE WITH TERMINAL CANCERS 
CAN STILL ENJOY THEIR LIVES AND SHE 
PRETTY MUCH PROVED THAT 
DID SHE 
ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET STARTED IN 
RUNNING 
YEAH I ALWAYS LIKED RUNNING RUNNING I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE 
DONE THIS AS SOON AS I AM DOING IT 
NOW BECAUSE OF MUM 
AND I NOTICE 
YOU HAVE A LITTLE SIGNATURE ON YOUR 
SHOULDER THERE WHAT IS THAT IT'S IT'S MY MUM'S THIS IS A TOP THAT I 
FOUND THE OTHER DAY I DIDN'T HAVE 
ANYTHING ELSE 
THAT'S AN INSPIRATION I AM SURE 
YOU HAVE THE LEEDS TEN K. RUN YOU 
ARE RAISING MONEY ELSEWHERE HOPING HOPING TO RAISE ONE M. I. L. L. I. O. N. THIS YEAR A 
TALL ORDER FOR US THE GOOD WORK 
JANE DID WE WANT TO CARRY ON WE 
THINK THE SUPPORT JANE'S HAD IS 
CARRYING US THROUGH 
DID IT 
SURPRISE YOU THE SORT OF THINGS SHE 
TOOK ON 
YEAH I THINK THINK 
EVERYTHING JANE DID RIGHT FROM THE 
START FROM DOING THE FIRST FIVE K. RACE 
AND WHEN SHE CAME HERE AND DID THE 
MARATHON TWO THOUSAND TWO WE WERE ASTONISHED 
SHE FINISHED SOMETIMES IT WAS THE 
SPEED 
SHE RAN AS WELL L. REMEMBER SHE DID THE GREAT NORTH IN ABOUT 
ONE H. O. U. R. FIFTY YOU ARE THINKING 
THAT'S A GOOD TIME FOR ANYONE BUT 
FOR SOMEONE WITH THE CANCER AND 
DISEASE SHE HAD WAS TOTALLY 
REMARKABLE AND IT REALLY I THINK 
THE THING SHE ALWAYS UNDERSTATED 
WAS HOW POORLY SHE WAS AND SHE WAS 
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME MUCH 
POORLY THAN SHE EVER ALLUDED TO 
SHE WAS AN AMAZING LADY WE MISS 
HER WELL DONE FOR RAISING THE 
MONEY AND CARRYING ON THE FIGHT WE 
WILL SPEAK TO YOU LATER THANK YOU BACK AT THE START WE ARE GETTING 
READY FOR THE MEN'S AND WOMEN'S 
WHEELCHAIR MARATHON CERTAINLY TWO 
VERY BIG FIELDS WE HAVE FIFTY TWO 
COMPETITORS IN BOTH THE MEN'S AND 
WOMEN'S RACES ALTOGETHER 
TANNI GREY THOMPSON EVERY CHANCE OF 
A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S VICTORIES 
BY DAVID WEIR AND SHELLY WOODS 
THEY'VE AN AMAZING CHANCE OF 
WINNING THEY'RE BOTH STRONG THIS 
YEAR THIS IS THE BEST FIELD WE 
HAVE EVER SEEN ON THE LONDON 
MARATHON WE HAVE THE WOMEN'S WORLD 
CHAMPION THE WOMEN'S WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER AMANDA MCGRORRY OF THE U. S. A. 
THERE IS SHELLY WOODS DESCRIBED BY 
QUITE A FEW AS THE NEW TANNI GREY 
THOMPSON NOT SURE THERE WILL BE 
ANOTHER TANNI GREY SHELLY WOODS 
DOING VERY WELL IN TRAINING 
AND AMANDA MCGRORRY MAKING HER 
LONDON DEBUT BUT A FINE COMPETITOR 
INDEED WE HAVE LOST ONE OF THE 
PRE EVENT FAVOURITES EDITH 
HUNKELER OF SWITZERLAND ON TO THE 
MEN DAVID WEIR VERY GOOD ON THE 
TRACK LAST YEAR ALMOST UNBEATABLE 
AND WON THE LONDON WHEELCHAIR 
MARATHON LAST YEAR 
POSSIBLY WE ARE EXPECTING 
TACTICAL RACE PARTICULARLY IN THE 
MEN'S COMPETITION 
I THINK IT'S 
GOING TO BE VERY TACTICAL BECAUSE 
THE STRUCTURE'S CHANGED THIS YEAR 
SO WINNER PRETTY MUCH TAKES IT ALL 
IT'S SUCH A STRONG FIELD ERNST HAD 
A DISAPPOINTING RUN LAST TIME WE 
WERE TRYING TO WORK OUT WHO IS 
GOING TO BE THE RACE FAVOURITE AND 
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE KURT WON IN 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR STRONG ATHLETE CERTAINLY TWO VERY VERY GOOD RACES 
EXPECTED LORD COE GETTING READY TO 
START THE WHEELCHAIR MARATHON 
CONDITIONS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
VERY LITTLE WIND DOWN THERE AT THE 
START AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE 
BALLOONS IN THE BACKGROUND 
SHELLY WOODS AND DAVID WEIR GOING 
FOR GREAT BRITAIN AND TRYING TO 
REPEAT THEIR VICTORIES OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
ERNST VAN DYK THE BIG FIGURE IN THE 
THE MIDDLE FROM SOUTH AFRICA AWAY 
WE GO 
WELL CERTAINLY THE FIRST PART OF 
THE RACE IS ALWAYS VERY QUICK 
ISN'T IT 
THE FIRST SIX MILES ARE 
INCREDIBLY QUICK FOR THE LONDON 
COURSE IT'S A TWISTY AND TURNEY 
COURSE SO YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE 
SEEING WORLD RECORD TIMES IT'S A 
SLIGHTLY SLOWER COURSE BUT ERNST 
CRASHED OUT OF FIVE K. LAST TIME ALL 
THE GUY THIS IS YEAR HAVE BEEN 
WATCHING OUT FOR THE FIRST PARTS OF 
THE RACE TO MAKE SURE THEY STAY 
VERY SAFE ERNST HAS TAKEN AN EARLY 
LEAD AND HE WANTS TO TRY AND 
CONTROL THE RACE HE WANTS TO KIND 
OF KEEP THE PACK TOGETHER HE IS 
VERY VERY STRONG IN THE LATER 
STAGE OF THE RACE BUT LIKES BEING 
AT THE FRONT LIKES CONTROLLING THE 
RACE AND LIKES CONTROLLING WHAT 
EVERYONE ELSE ARE DOING 
THINGS LOOKING COMFORTABLE AT THE 
HEAD OF THE RACE BUT I WONDER HOW 
THE BRITISH CONTINGENT THE 
MAGNIFICENT CHAMPIONS FROM LAST 
YEAR DAVID WEIR AND SHELLY WOODS 
FEEL ABOUT THEIR PROSPECTS TODAY 
IT'S ALWAYS THE BIGGEST RACE 
PROBABLY OF THE YEAR 
AND IT'S GOOD PREPARATION BUILDING 
UP TO BEIJING 
AND I ALWAYS SEEM TO DO WELL AT 
LONDON AND AT THE END OF THE SEASON 
I ALWAYS SEEM TO PEAK AT TWO TIMES 
OF THE YEAR 
IT'S VERY COMPETITIVE 
PROBABLY THE BEST LONDON MARATHON 
FIELD EVER 
IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
RACES OF MY CAREER SO FAR 
YOU KNOW WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
I THINK TO WIN ON SUNDAY IT WOULD 
PROBABLY COME DOWN TO BEING A 
COURSE RECORD OR SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT BEIJING IS GOING TO BE INTERESTING 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CHINESE 
ATHLETES ARE DOING 
AND IN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPSA FEW 
OF THE CHINESE MADE THE FINAL IN MY 
EVENT EVENT SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE STRONG 
TWO IS THE POLLUTION LEVEL I DON'T 
KNOW HOW MANY EVENTS TO DO I WAS 
DOWN TO DO FIVE EVENTS 
I AM NOT SURE HOW MANY NOW 
DEPENDING ON THE POLLUTION LEVEL I 
WON'T KNOW UNTIL I GET THERE 
IT'S STILL GOING TO BE PROBABLY ONE 
OF THE BEST PARALYMPICS EVER IT TELLS ME WHAT I NEED TO WORK ON 
AFTER THIS RACE AND I WILL BUILD ON 
IT AND USE IT AS A BUILD UP TO 
BEIJING I HAVE A FEW RACES THROUGH 
THE SUMMER IN SWITZERLAND AND THE 
U. S. U. S. LIKE THIS KICKSTARTS IT ALL 
IT GETS YOU ROLLING ON THE WAY TO 
BEIJING BEIJING SOME GREAT PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE

DROPPED OFF THAT PACE IS FAIR IT 
IS A GOOD THING THEY DOESN'T WANT 
TO GET SUCK INTO GOING TOO QUICK 
THERE SHE IS FIFTEEN TO TWENTY METRES 
ADRIFT OF THAT LEAD GROUP HER RACE 
PLAN WOULD HAVE BEEN TO PERHAPS GET

HER HUSBAND MARTIN YELLING WHO 
TRAINS AND HELPS COACH LIZ HE IS

HAYLEY HAINING THAT IS THE BATTLE 
FOR THE BRITISH SPOT IN THE OLYMPIC 
TEAM FOR BEIJING A LITTLE BIT OF A 
BREAK BREAK SHE LIVES IN JAPAN AND HAS BEEN 
CAUSING STIR IN JAPAN WITH HER 
PERFORMANCES OVER OVER A HALF 
MARATHON THESE TWO ATHLETES ARE 
RUNNING EXTREMELY QUICKLY L. HOPE 
THEY REALISE BECAUSE OF THE SLOW 
FIRST MILE THE OVERALL TIME THEY 
NEED RECALCULATE THEY ARE OPERATING 
AN EXCEPTIONAL PACE IF YOU TAKE 
THE FIRST MILE OUT SIX MINUTES THIRTEEN 
SECONDS THEY ARE OPERATING VERY 
VERY CLOSE TO TWO HOURS TWENTY TWO PACE WHICH 
IS REALLY TOUGH AND REALLY STRONG 
THERE IS A COUPLE OF ATHELETES 
GETE W. A. M. I. IN THE RED VEST AND THE 
YELLOW VEST WHO ARE MOVING UP TO 
THE THREAD HAVE RUN THAT QUICK 
CALCULATION NEEDS TO BE DONE IT IS 
A SMART MOVE BY LIZ YELLING TO 
DRIFT OFF THAT LEADING GROUP 
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE MAY PAY THE 
PENALTY IN THE LATER STAGES SOME OF THE FIRST FINISHERS IN THE 
MALL THIS YEAR OF COURSE COME FROM 
THE MANY LONDON MARATHON THE 
WHEELCHAIRS THE FIRST TO FINISH 
THIS COULD POSSIBLE BE MICKEY 
BUSHELL WE ARE NOT SURE ABOUT THAT 
WE WILL HAVE TO CONFIRM THE WINNERS 
LATER ON THREE MILES COMPETED IN 
JUST OVER THIRTEEN MINI MINUTES THAT 
IS THE FIRST FINISHER THE FIRST 
OF MANY HERE TODAY A LOT OF THE 
RUNNERS COMING IN TOO 
MINI MARATHON IS DIVIDE INTO THREE 
AGE GROUPS FROM ALL OVER LONDON 
ALL OVER THE COUNTRIES AND THE 
REENONS CERTAINLY STEVE THEMINI 
MARATHON HAS PRODUCED SENIOR 
CHAMPIONS TOO THESE ARE THE BEST KIDS THEY HAVE 
BEEN CHOOSEN FROM THEIR COUNTIES 
FROM PERFORMANCES IN THE ENGLISH 
SCHOOLS AND NATIONAL HOME COUNTY

FINISHING HERE TODAY 
TWENTY SIX MILES FURTHER BACK AND THEY ARE 
STILL FLOODING THROUGH THE GATES 
AS BRENDAN WAS SAYING EARLIER THEY 
ARE ALL WEARING THE CHIPS ON THEIR 
SHOES WHEN THEY PASS THE START LINE 
THAT IS WHEN THEIR TIME WILL START 
WE ARE ALREADY ABOUT ELEVEN MINUTES 
INTO THIS RACE IT USED TO BE THE 
CASE THAT PEOPLE WOULD WEAR THEIR 
OWN WATCH AND START THEIR WATCH AS 
SOON AS THEY PAST THE START LINE 
THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THEIR 
FINISHING TIME IN FOUR FIVE SIX 
SEVEN EIGHT HOURS TIME THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
PEOPLE STARTED THE RACE LAST YEAR 
THERE WILL BE AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER 
THIS YEAR I'M SURE CONDITIONS I 
THINK STEVE QUITE KIND TODAY NOT

RUN GOOD RACES TO TRY AND WIN THE 
PRIZE MONEY BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF 
MAJOR MARATHONS IN THE COURSE OF A 
YEAR THE OLYMPICS COMES ONCE EVERY 
FOUR YEARS FOR MANY OF THESE

OLYMPICS AND HALF AN EYE ON THIS 
RACE TODAY WELL WE COULD SAY DEL BOY AND 
RODNEY BATMAN AND ROBIN THEY MUST

REPORTERS OUT THERE IN FRONT OF 
THE WOMEN'S RACE PETER ELLIOT IS 
THERE 
MORNING STEVE YES I AM THERE HERE AT THE SIDE OF LIZ YELLING AND 
I WOULD SAY FROM THE LEADING PACK 
SHE'S PROBABLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY METRES 
ADRIFT OF LIZ THAT INJECTION OF 
PACE EARLY ON WAS THE THING THAT 
REALLY AFFECTED LIZ BUT SHE'S GOT 
TO RUN HER OWN RACE OBVIOUSLY 
SHE'S TRIED TO QUALIFY FOR AN 
OLYMPIC PLACE THAT'S THE BIGGER 
PICTURE AND SHE'S GOT TO STICK TO 
HER OWN RUN IT'S SHE'S BEING 
OVERTAKEN BY WHEELCHAIR ATHLETES 
LOOKED LIKE CONSCIOUS DECISION TO 
SETTLE BACK DOES SHE STILL LOOK 
COMFORTABLE LOOKS O. K. TO US BUT YOU 
ARE CLOSER 
SHE LOOKS O. K. SHE WILL 
HAVE HER OWN GAME PLAN AND 
UNFORTUNATELY SHE'S PROBABLY SOME 
FORTY MEETERS ADRIFT OF THE NEXT 
RUNNER AND AND IS GOING TO HAVE TO 
DO ALL THE WORK HERSELF NOTHING AT 
THIS MOMENT TO INDICATE TO SAY THAT 
SHE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING BUT 
OBVIOUSLY STICKING TO THE RACE PLAN 
THAT SHE HAD 
THANK YOU FOR NOW 
PETER WILL BE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE 
PROGRESS OF THAT BRITISH BATTLE IF 
YOU LIKE HAYLEY HAINING ANOTHER 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY METRES ADRIFT OF LIZ YELLING 
LIZ WATCHING THESE LEADERS REALLY 
START TO FORCE THE PACE AND MOVE ON 
SHE'S RUNNING SOLID RACE THERE 
SEE HER IN THE DISTANCE NOT TOO 
FAR BEHIND THIS GROUP BUT NOW ABLE 
TO CONCENTRATE ON HER OWN RUN 
SHE'S RUNNING AT PACE WHICH IF 
SHE CONTINUES AT AT ANYTHING LIKE 
THIS WILL RUN INSIDE HER PERSONAL 
BEST INSIDE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY I THINK THAT'S 
GOT TO BE TARGET FOR LIZ YELLING 
SHE'S RUNNING AS WELL AS WE HAVE 
EVER EVER SEEN EXPERIENCED NOW IN 
MARATHONS RUN IN HOT CONDITIONS

AFFECT THE ATHLETES OUT THERE FOR 
FOUR FIVE SIX HOURS BUT CERTAINLY 
NOT THE ELITE ATHLETES MOST WILL 
BE DONE AND DUSTED MIKITENKO 
HAVING LOOK AT HER WATCH TO SEE 
IF THEY'RE ON SCHEDULE AS THEY 
CROSS TOWER BRIDGE HAVE I GOT TO 
THE HALFWAY IN THE TIME IN WHICH I 
INTENDED AM I FEELING GOOD AM I 
STILL FOLLOWING THE GAME PLAN AND 
LIZ YELLING'S GAME PLAN WOULD HAVE 
BEEN TO GET TO HALFWAY IN AROUND SEVENTY THREE 
MINUTES PERHAPS UNDER THAT IF 
CERTAINLY NOT MUCH QUICKER THAN 
THAT I KNOW ON FRIDAY TALKING 
ABOUT IT SHE SAID IF I AM MUCH 
QUICKER THAN THAT I HAVE PERHAPS 
OVERCOOKED IT A LITTLE BIT THERE 
IS SO MUCH EXPERIENCE DOWN THERE 
THE LIKES OF LIZ YELLING THEY DO 
SO MANY MILES LOT ON THEIR OWN 
THE TROUBLE IS ON RACE DAY 
SOMETIMES YOU CAN JUST GET CARRIED 
AWAY WITH THE OCCASION AND WHAT'S 
AT STAKE 
THE LEADING GROUP OF NINE ATHLETES 
INCLUDING TWO OF THE FAVOURITES 
GETA W. A. M. I. AND BERHANE ADERE JUST 
BEHIND THOSE THAT GROUP IS AN 
ATHLETE FROM ROMANIA 
LIZ YELLING SHE WILL GET 
TREMENDOUS SUPPORT HERE THAT'S THE 
LEADING GROUP CONSTANTINA TOMESCU 
DITA SALINA KOSGEI OF KENYA 
KIMWEI AND THERE IS LIZ YELLING 
SHE WAS SAYING WHEN SHE RUNS IN 
RACES LIKE THIS THE CROWD SEE 
BLONDE ATHLETE IN A GREAT BRITAIN 
VEST AND SHE SAY COME ON PAULA 
BUT SHE IS RUNNING WELL TODAY SHE 
IS RUNNING A STRONG RACE SHE IS 
APPROACHING THE HALFWAY POINT SHE 
IS JUST ABOUT ON SCHEDULE FOR HER 
TARGET SHE IS GOING TO BE CLOSE TO 
THE SEVENTY THREE MINUTE POINT SHE LOOKS 
COMFORTABLE LOOKS STRONG SHE'S 
SETTLED DOWN AT THE RIGHT TIME AND 
THEN HAYLEY HAINING THE NEXT 
BRITISH ATHLETE SHE'S OVER TOWER 
BRIDGE TOO IT'S GOING TO BE A 
COMPETITIVE RACE BETWEEN THESE TWO 
TWO BRITISH ATHLETES CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED THIRTY 
THE BRITISH ATHLETES THE WOMEN'S 
ATHLETES REALLY HOLDING THEIR FORT 
TOGETHER AND RUNNING EXTREMELY WELL 
HAYLEY HAINING WHO WAS SUCH A 
PRESTIGIOUS TALENT AS A JUNIOR HAS 
HAD SO MANY INJURIES OVER THE YEARS 
CAUSED BY FOOT PROBLEMS AND PRETTY 
MUCH GAVE UP THE SPORT BUT THREE 
FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN SHE GOT BACK 
INTO REGULAR TRAINING FOUND THAT 
MARATHON WAS VERY MUCH TO HER 
LIKING SHE'S A VET IN GLASGOW 
CERTAINLY PERFORMING WELL TODAY 
SHE'S ACTUALLY VET IN TERMS OF 
AGE GROUP OVER THIRTY FIVE FOR THE WOMEN 
I THINK SHE'S RATHER GOOD DESCRIBED 
AS VET FOR THE REAL REASON THE THE CLEARUP OPERATION ALREADY BEGINNING 
YOU ALWAYS LIKE A DAY FULL OF 
STATISTICS STATISTICS THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED BAGS OF RUBBISH WILL BE FILLED 
TO CLEAR THAT AREA UP 
THEY NEED A BIG BAG TO PUT HIM IN 
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE ISN'T THAT 
LLOYD SCOTT DIDN'T I SEE THAT HE 
WAS PLANNING TO TAKE ABOUT A WEEK 
TO COMPLETE THE DISTANCE INDEED INDEED HE WAS IN A DIVING SUIT WASN'T HE 
I THINK THIS YEAR HE'S GONE IN 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
JUST LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE TWENTY K. 
TIMES FOR THE WOMEN LOOKS SLOW BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY K. 
JUST CHECK THAT 
BUT THERE ALL THE THE BIG NAMES 
VERY MUCH IN THAT GROUP CONSTANTINA TOMESCU DITA NEVER TOO 
FAR FROM THE FRONT AND LIZ YELLING 
AS WE MENTIONED FURTHER BACK 
SIMILAR STORY IN THE MEN'S RACE 
REALLY IT'S BEEN GOOD PACE IN 
THE MEN'S RACE THEY'VE BEEN MOVING 
QUITE WELL THAT GROUP IS PERHAPS A 
LITTLE SMALLER THAN WE MIGHT HAVE 
EXPECTED BUT RYAN HALL MARTIN LEL 
MUTAI HENDRICK RAMAALA AT THE BACK 
KEEPING AN EYE ON EVERYTHING AHEAD 
OF HIM 
BALDINI ALWAYS TENDS TO SIT BACK 
DOESN'T HE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS ON 
THESE BIG DAYS ALWAYS TENDS TO 
FINISH VERY STRONGLY BUT AT THIS 
EARLY STAGE IT'S A SMALL GROUP 
IT'S A FAIRLY SMALL GROUP THE 
REASON IT IS IS THEY'RE OPERATING 
AT WORLD RECORD PACE YOU LOOK AT 
THE TIME OVERALL IT'S EXTREMELY 
FAST IT'S PROBABLY TOO FAST AND 
THEY ARE BEING STRETCHED HERE AT 
THIS EARLY STAGE AND STEFANO 
BALDINI THE OLYMPIC CHAMPION THE 
ITALIAN ATHLETE IS REALLY GETTING 
READY TO DEFEND HIS TITLE IN 
BEIJING THIS RACE IS GOING TO BE 
HE KNEW WHAT TIME THE PACE MAKERS 
WERE RUNNING WASN'T GOING TO GO 
AHROEU LONG TO GO ALONG HE HAS 
A FEW MONTHS LEFT TO GET READY TO 
GO TO BEIJING REPRESENTING ITALY 
AND TRYING TO WIN THE OLYMPIC GOLD 
MEDAL IN THE MARATHON FOR THE 
SECOND TIME THE TWO PACE MAKERS 
THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY THE STARS 
THAT'S WORRYINGLY FAST THAT'S WELL 
INSIDE THAT'S SILLY LONDON IS 
QUICK COURSE AND PAULA RADCLIFFE 
HAS SHOWN THAT OF COURSE WE HAVE 
HAD ONE OR TWO QUICK RACES IN THE 
MEN'S EVENTS OVER THE YEARS BUT 
THAT'S IT'S NOT REALLY THE TYPE 
OF RACE WE HAVE SEEN IN LONDON IN 
RECENT YEARS IT'S GOING TO BE 
INTERESTING HOW THIS PANS OUT IT'S 
A BIG DECISION FOR THE LIKES OF 
RYAN HALL TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS 
EARLY STAGE LOOK AT THE GAP THAT 
GROUP ARE MILES AHEAD OF THE REST 
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY DECIDED THIS IS 
WAY WAY TOO FAST IN THE EARLY 
STAGES STAGES JUST LOOKING AT THE WOMEN'S 
WHEELCHAIR RACE SHELLY WOODS LOOKS 
LIKE SHE'S IN THIRD PLACE THE 
FIELD HEADED BY SANDRA GRAF AND 
AMANDA MCGRORY 
SHELLEY IS SO 
STRONG IN THE RAIN AND WIND SANDRA 
GRAF IS ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS UP ON 
WOODS STILL A LONG WAY TO GO 
SHELLEY IS NOW ENTEFRING THE 
ENTERING THE STRONGEST PART OF THE 
RACE FOR HER 
THE GAP IS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED 
M. AS WE LOOK AT IT CERTAINLY THE 
SWISS ATHLETE SANDRA GRAF AND THE 
AMERICAN MCGRORY QUITE SOME WAY 
AHEAD OF SHELLY WOODS AND SHE 
DIDN'T WANT TO BE ISOLATED LIKE 
THIS IT WOULD BE FAR BETTER IF SHE 
WAS BE SOMEBODY TO DRAFT BEHIND HER 
AND HELP HER ON HER WAY WE WILL 
TRY TO KEEP YOU UP TO DATE WITH 
SHELLY WOODS' PROGRESS AS TIME GOES 
ON GREAT BRITAIN IN THIRD PLACE 
FOR THE TIME BEING IN THE 
WHEELCHAIR RACE 
THERE IS SHELLEY WE KNOW SHE'S IN 
GOOD SHAPE 
CERTAINLY WE HEARD FROM HER BEFORE 
IN TERMS OF HER PROSPECTS RIGHT 
THROUGH TOWARDS THE PARALYMPICS WE 
EXPECT TO SEE HER IN MANCHESTER AS 
WELL AT THE PARALYMPIC WORLD CUP 
SHELLEY'S HAD FANTASTIC WINTER 
TRAINING HAD GOOD VICTORIES IN THE 
FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND IT'S STILL LOOKING GOOD 
FOR HER 
A VERY FAST PACE IN THE EARLY 
STAGES OF THE MEN'S RACE AND 
KEEPING AN EYE ON THINGS FOR US ON 
THE BACK OF THE BIKE RICHARD THIS 
IS QUICK RICHARD 
IT'S VERY QUICK 
THEY WENT THROUGH TEN K. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHT 
THE WORLD CHAMPION IS MORE THAN 
HALF A MINUTE BACK ON THAT LEAD 
GROUP OF NINE STEFANO BALDINI WENT 
THROUGH MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF 
MINUTES BEHIND THIS LEADING GROUP 
SO THEY'RE OPERATING AS BRENDAN 
SAID WELL UNDER WORLD RECORD PACE 
WELL THE INTERESTING THING IS 
THERE IS BIG GROUP OF ATHLETES 
RUNNING AT THAT SORT OF PACE THAT 
MEANS QUITE FEW 
ARE GOING TO ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING A LOT FASTER 
IT LOOKS TO ME THROUGH SIX MILES 
AND TEN THOUSAND METRES THEY'RE OPERATING 
JUST ABOUT TWENTY THREE PACE FOR THE 
MARATHON WHICH IS TOO FAST HAILE 
GEBRSELASSIE HOLDS THE RECORD FOR 
THE MARATHON HIS TIME IS TWENTY FOUR POINT TWO SIX 
AND THAT WAS IN BERLIN WHICH IS 
MUCH MORE CONDUCIVE COURSE FOR FAST 
TIMES THE PACE MAKERS ARE DOING 
GOOD JOB AND THEY'VE A LOT OF 
COMPANY SURPRISINGLY LOT OF 
THESE ATHLETES LOOK AT THOSE MILE 
TIMES TIMES THE INTERESTING THING HERE IS THAT 
THE COURSE DROPS IN THE FIRST FEW 
MILES DOWN TOWARDS THE RIVER AND 
TOWARDS THE CUTTY SARK AND THE REST 
IS PRETTY FLAT OVERALL THE EARLY 
MILES SOMETIMES ARE QUICK BUT THIS 
IS THE FASTEST OPENING WE HAVE EVER 
SEEN IN A LONDON MARATHON 
I THINK 
IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE LIKES OF 
RYAN HALL HAVE DECIDED TO GO WITH 
THIS THE PROBLEM IS THE GAP IS SO 
BIG BETWEEN THAT GROUP AND THE REST 
I GUESS YOU HAVE TO TEST YOURSELF 
YOU GOT TO FIND OUT AND HE IS 
CERTAINLY GOING TO SEE AS PERHAPS 
WILL ONE OR TWO OF THE OTHERS WHAT 
WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF WHEN YOU GO 
AT THIS SORT OF PACE SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS IN THE LATTER STAGES 
CERTAINLY THE ONE THING YOU CAN SAY 
YOU ALMOST GET EXCITED WHEN YOU SEE 
A FAST PACE YOU KNOW THERE IS 
GOING TO BE DRAMA LATER YOU KNOW 
SOMEBODY IN THIS HAS GOT THIS 
HORRIBLY WRONG AND ONE OR TWO MIGHT 
GET IT RIGHT 
YOU WOULD THINK SEFRG 
HAVE GOT SEVERAL HAVE GOT IT 
WRONG GOING THIS QUICK SOME OF 
THESE ATHLETES INCLUDING RYAN HALL 
HIS COACH SAYING HE IS RUNNING 
BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE HE OPENED 
HERE LAST YEAR RUNNING TWO HUNDRED EIGHT L. 
DON'T THINK ANYBODY WAS EXPECTING 
HIM OR ANYONE TO BE RUNNING TWO HUNDRED THREE 
THE RACE DIRECTOR WILL BE 
ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED WE LOOK DOWN 
THE FIELD WE SEE THE BRITISH 
ATHLETES TOMAS ABYU LEADING IN THE 
BRITISH FIELD AND THEN DAN ROBINSON 
AND THEN PETE RILEY DAN ROBINSON WAS ELEVENTH POSITION AT 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS LAST YEAR 
AND HE IS PRETTY MUCH ALMOST 
GUARANTEED A PLACE AS NOBODY ELSE 
RUNS UNDER TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN TOMAS ABYU HAS TO 
RUN A QUICKER PACE THAT'S WHY HE 
IS AHEAD OF DAN ROBINSON TOMAS 
ABYU HAS RUN UNDER TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN IT WAS IN 
DUBLIN COURSE THAT'S NOT BEEN 
RATIFIED SO THAT TIME DOESN'T 
COUNT TOMAS ABYU FORMER ETHIOPIAN 
HE HASN'T BEEN WELL HE HAS HAD 
BRONCHITIS IT'S A RISK FOR HIM TO 
GO OFF THAT QUICK 
HE IS RUNNING 
FASTER THAN TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN SO FAR WE ARE 
GOING TO SEE A DRAMATIC UNFOLDING 
IN THE MEN'S RACE BECAUSE OF HOW 
QUICK THEY'RE GOING AND THE BRITISH 
MEN ARE GOING THERE IS GOING TO 
BE SOME CHANGES AND DRAMA THERE TOO 
THEY'RE RUNNING EXTREMELY QUICKLY 
AND THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT 
DAN ROBINSON THE MOST EXPERIENCED 
OF THE BRITISH DISTANCE RUNNERS 
THE ATHLETE I THINK DESERVESA PLACE 
IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES IS RUNNING A 
SENSIBLE RACE AND RUNNING A SOLID 
PACE FROM HIS OWN POINT OF VIEW 
WELL WE ARE BEYOND HALFWAY IN THE 
WOMEN'S RACE NOW THINGS ARE 
STARTING TO HAPPEN 
GETA W. A. M. I. FOR THE FIRST TIME MOVING 
TO THE FRONT MIKITENKO HAVING A 
LOOK TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND 
WHO IS GOING WITH THIS PACE SHE 
WILL SEE THE TALL FIGURE OF BERHANE 
ADERE THE OTHER ETHIOPIAEN IN THE 
YELLOW THESE FOUR STARTING TO MOVE 
AWAY THE HALFWAY TIME WAS SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO 
THERE IS YELLING WHO WAS IN TWELFTH 
PLACE SO LIZ YELLING PRETTY MUCH 
RUNNING TO SCHEDULE PERHAPS SLOWER 
THAN SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED PERHAPS 
THAT INJECTION OF PACE EARLY ON 
MIGHT HAVE TOLD L. THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING 
FOR THE NEXT SPOT HAYLEY HAINING'S 
ONLY ABOUT SECONDS AT THAT 
POINT WAS SECONDS BEHIND LIZ 
YELLING IF SHE STAYS THIS CLOSE 
SHE ALWAYS FELT THIS WAS GOING TO 
BE AHARE AND ARE TO AND TORTOISE 
EVENT AS WELL AS THE BRITISH 
ATHLETES SHE WAS GOING TO RUN HER 
OWN RACE AND HOPING TO CATCH LIZ 
YELLING IN THE LATTER STAGES 
WATCHING THIS WE HOPE IS PETER 
ELLIOT 
HI STEVE YES I AM DOWN ELLIOT HERE CURRENTLY WITH THE LEAD GROUP 
AS I LOOK DOWN THE ROAD ACTUALLY I 
CAN'T SEE MUCH OF LIZ YELLING AT 
ALL WE HAVE HAD OBVIOUSLY AN 
INJECTION OF PACE AND THEY'VE GONE 
AHEAD 
HREUS IS IN 
TWELFTH LIZ IS IN AHEAD TWELFTH PLACE SHE IS FURTHER ADRIFT 
PROBABLY ABOUT FORTY FIVE SECONDS BEHIND 
THE LEADERS AS WE HAVE HAD THAT 
BREAKUP AND THEY'VE MOVED OR 
THERE'S BEEN A MOVE AT THE FRONT 
FROM GETA W. A. M. I. THE PRE RACE 
FAVOURITE AND HAS REALLY PUT HER 
FOOT DOWN A LITTLE BIT THERE 
FIVE POINT TWO OH FOR THAT FIFTEENTH MILE GETA W. A. M. I. 
HAD THAT FANTASTIC RATES IN RACE 
IN NEW YORK IN NOVEMBER WHEN SHE 
RACED AGAINST PAULA RADCLIFFE AND 
CERTAINLY AT THAT POINT WE THOUGHT 
PAULA BACK ON HER WELL TO FULL 
FITNESS AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES BUT SINCE THEN HAS 
SUFFERED INJURY PROBLEMS NOT HERE 
IN LONDON IT WAS IN HER PLANS 
LET'S HEAR FROM PAULA HERSELF AS TO 
HOW HER RECOVERY IS GOING 
I AM REALLY GUTTED I AM NOT ABLE TO 
BE TAKING PART THIS YEAR IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME 
AND APRIL COMES ROUND EACH YEAR AND 
IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE SOMETHING'S 
WRONG IF I AM NOT RUNNING IN LONDON 
I AM HAPPY I AM NOT INJURED 
WATCHING IT THAT'S HARDER 
TO BE ABLE TO DO MY RUN TO WATCH IT 
AND DO MY RUN LATER IN THE DAY 
THAT HELPS ME 
THE FRUSTRATION AND THE ANGER 
ALMOST AT NOT BEING ABLE TO BE 
THERE WILL BE STORED UP AND USED 
FULLY THROUGH THE REST OF THE YEAR 
ESPECIALLY IN BEIJING 
WHAT'S THE CURRENT STATE OF YOUR 
FITNESS 
IT'S BETTER THAN I THOUGHT FITNESS CONSIDERING THE TIME I MISSED I 
HAD ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS WHERE I WAS 
ABLE TO CROSS TRAIN THE WHOLE WAY 
THROUGH AND COME BACK AT RUNNING 
DIFFERENT STAGES THROUGH IT BUT 
NEVER TO GET BACK 
NOW I HAVE BEEN BACK RUNNING ABOUT 
OVER TWO WEEKS AND I AM FURTHER ON 
THAN I THOUGHT I WAS 
I DID RUNS LAST WEEK AND WAS 
ENCOURAGED BY HOW GOOD I WAS 
FEELING FEELING IT WILL COME BACK AND WILL BE FINE 
FOR BEIJING BUT IT'S DISAPPOINTING 
NOT TO BE IN LONDON THIS WEEKEND 
WELL THE LEAD GROUP NOW DOWN TO 
FOUR ATHLETES AND TWO WE FULLY 
EXPECTED TO BE THERE THE TWO 
ETHIOPIAEN RIVALS GETA W. A. M. I. FORMER 
WORLD TEN THOUSAND M. CHAMPION THREE 
TIMES OLYMPIC MEDALLIST IN THE 
RECEIPTED AND RED AND WHITE VEST BEHIND THOSE TWO WITH MIKITENKO 
THERE IS LIZ YELLING GONE THROUGH 
THE HALFWAY POINT WELL ON FOR HER 
PERSONAL BEST SEVENTY THREE MINUTES WELL ON 
SCHEDULE TO RUN UNDER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY WHICH 
WE ALL KNOW SHE IS DESPERATE TO DO 
THIRTY SECONDS BEHIND HER IS HAYLEY 
HAINING THE BRITISH TEAM FOR THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES WE JUST HEARD FROM 
PAULA RADCLIFFE MARA YAMAUCHI IN 
PRINCIPLE PRE SELECTED LIZ YELLING 
IF SHE COMES HOME FIRST FOR BRITAIN 
TODAY HAS ALREADY ACHIEVED A 
QUALIFYING TIME SHE WOULD BE 
SELECTED HAYLEY HAINING THIRTY SECONDS 
BEHIND HER AND RUNNING STRONGLY SO 
IT'S GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING 
RACE FOR THE FIRST BRITON HOME 
TODAY IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE BOTH 
GOING TO END UP WITH GOOD TIMES AS 
WE LOOK OVERHEAD YOU CAN SEE THE 
LEADING GROUP MIKITENKO AND SOUAD 
AIT SALEM OF ALGEARIA ALGERIA 
THEN TWO OF THE MOST OUTSTANDING 
RUNNERS BERHANE ADERE AND GETA 
W. A. M. I. THE PACE STRONG AROUND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR 
IN THE MEANTIME THE MEN WE HAVE 
HEARD GONE THROUGH EIGHT MILES IN 
THIRTY SEVEN MINUTES AND THIRTY SIX SECONDS THAT'S A 
MINUTE AND A HALF FASTER THAN THE 
WORLD RECORD FOR THE MARATHON IT'S 
GOING TO BE EXTREMELY INTERESTING 
THERE IS A LOT OF THEM THERE SOME 
OF THEM CLEARLY RUNNING BEYOND 
THEIR ABILITY RUNNING FAR TOO 
QUICKLY MAYBE ONE OR TWO OF THEM 
ARE GOING TO STAY STRONG ON THIS 
PACE CONDITIONS FOR GREAT FOR 
MARATHON RUNNING THE FIELD IS 
STRONG ENOUGH THE PACE MAKERS ARE 
DOING A TERRIFIC JOB LOOK HOW FAST 
THEY'RE GOING THEY'RE OPERATING AT 
FOUR MINUTES AND THIRTY FIVE 
WELL TALK ABOUT TELLING YOU 
EVERYTHING YOU YOU NEED TO KNOW WE 
WILL SHORTLY BE GIVING YOU DETAILS 
OF HOW YOU CAN ENTER NEXT YEAR'S 
RACE IF ALL OF THIS HAS INSPIRED 
YOU TO GET OFF SHALL WE SAY GET 
OFF YOUR SOFA OR BACKSIDES 
WHATEVER AND HAVE A GO NEXT YEAR 
WE WILL GIVE YOU THOSE DETAILS 
SHORTLY THIS MEN'S RACE I THINK 
IT WILL BE FASCINATING 
THEY'RE JUST ABOUT COMPLETED NINE 
MILES OR SO THE PACE MAKERS HAVING 
A LOOK AT EACH OTHER SAYING ARE WE 
GETTING THIS RIGHT ARE WE GOING TOO 
QUICK NOT SURE HOW MUCH 
INSTRUCTION THEY'RE GETTING FROM 
THE ATHLETES AROUND THEM LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THAT GROUP 
MARTIN LEL FELIX LIMO 
AND RIGHT AMONGST ALL OF THAT 
AFRICAN TALENT IS RYAN HALL OF THE 
U. S. A. THE AMERICAN CHAMPION AND A 
MAN HOPING THAT TODAY IN PARTICULAR 
HE CAN PRODUCE SOMETHING SPECIAL IT'S A PEGS RUN OBVIOUSLY THE BIG 
THING IS BELIEVING THAT YOU CAN 
THAT'S SOMETHING I HAVE ALWAYS 
BELIEVED THAT'S THE BIGGEST PART 
I PROVED LAST YEAR THAT I CAN COME 
OUT AND HANG WITH THESE GUYS AT 
LEAST TWENTY THREE HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR I 
WILL MAKE IT FURTHER 
WITH EVERY MARATHON I HAVE GOTTEN 
STRONGER AND STRONGER HALF 
MARATHONS'S A LOT DIFFERENT THAN A 
FULL MARATHON TAKES TIME TO FINISH 
THE DISTANCE L. FEEL LIKE EVERY 
TIME I PREPARED I HAVE GOTTEN 
STRONGER AND STRONGER 
EVERY TIME I RACED I FELT BETTER 
HOPEFULLY THIRD TIME'S CHARM AND 
I CAN RUN FAST 
RYAN HALL SO FAR SO GOOD HE WAS 
HOPING FOR A QUICK RACE TODAY 
THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT HE'S GOT HE 
HAS BEEN BRAVE ENOUGH TO GO WITH 
THE EARLY PACE 
PERHAPS SHOULD JUST MENTION THAT 
BOSTON TODAY IS THE WOMEN'S TRIAL 
THE AMERICANS HAVING THEIR WOMEN'S 
TRIAL OPERATE TO THE MEN'S TRIAL 
THE MEN'S TRIAL WAS IN NEW YORK AND 
IT WAS TRAGIC DAY THAT DAY IN 
NOVEMBER RYAN SHAY ONE OF THE 
ATHLETES AND A FRIEND OF RYAN HALL 
WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE CONTENDERS 
SADLY DIED DURING THE RACE ON THAT 
DAY AND A LOT OF AMERICAN ATHLETES 
WILL HAVE THOUGHTS OF HIM TODAY 
AND INDEED WHEN THE ATHLETES 
EVENTUALLY GET TO BEIJING 
AND THAT RACE VERY MUCH WORTH 
KEEPING AN EYE ON WE HAVE THE 
WOMEN'S RACE AND THE WHEELCHAIR 
ATHLETES WHO ARE ALREADY AROUND THE 
CANARY WHARF AREA CANARY WHARF 
LOOKING MORE POPULATED THAN IN 
RECENT YEARS BUT THE LEADING 
CONTENDERS IN THE MEN'S WHEELCHAIR 
RACE ONCE AGAIN DAVID WEIR WEARING 
THE RED VEST JUST ON THE LEFT OF 
THAT GROUP THERE L. THINK WE HAVE 
SOME NEWS ON THE WOMEN'S RACE AS 
WELL HAVEN'T WE TANNI 
AT THE 
HALFWAY POINT SANDRA GRAN WAS A 
MINUTE AHEAD OF SHELLY WOODS ONE 
THING YOU CAN'T DO WITH WOODS IS 
WRITE HER OFF THE MEN'S RACE IS 
RIGHTING ERNST VAN DYK HE WANTS 
SOMEONE ELSE TO TAKE THE FRONT HE 
SAID IT DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE A 
SPRINT FINISH HE WOULD QUITE LIKE 
TO HAVE A SORT OF A SPRINT IT'S 
ANYBODY'S RACE AT THE MOMENT 
THEY'RE ON FOR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY PACE NOT 
COURSE RECORD BUT STILL FAST IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WE COULD BE 
HEADED TOWARDS THAT SPRINT FINISH 
THAT MANY PEOPLE HAD PREDICTED 
BEFORE THE RACE 
NOBODY HAS SPRINTED AWAY FROM THE 
PACK DAVID WEIR CONSTANTLY LOOKING 
AROUND HIM LOOKING TO SEE IF HE IS 
GOING TO GET HELP WITH THE PACE 
ERNST VAN DYK IS UP THERE AS WELL 
KURT FEARNLEY THE AUSTRALIAN 
ALONG WITH ANOTHER SOUTH AFRICAN IS 
BACK IN ABOUT THIRD PLACE AT THE 
MOMENT DAVID WEIR AT THE MOMENT 
SWERVEING ALL OVER THE ROAD THERE 
LOOKING BEHIND BET THERE IS 
TALKING GOING ON THERE SAYING 
COME ON BOYS WHO IS GOING TO TAKE 
THE PACE NOW WHO IS GOING TO HELP 
IF ANYBODY HAS ANY SENSE NOBODY 
WILL HELP DAVID WEIR BECAUSE SHE 
KNOW THE SPRINT FINISH HE'S GOT 
AFTER BIT OF BREAK BY MIKITENKO 
PE TROVE YA THE RUSSIA WE WILL 
CALL IT YELLOW VEST THERE SHE IS 
ALONGSIDE MIKITENKO WHO HAS BEEN 
KEEN TO FORCE THE PACE THE GERMAN 
HERE LOOKING AT HER WATCH WANTING 
TO MAKE SURE THE PACE DOESN'T SLACK 
SHE MUST BE CONFIDENT OF HER 
ABILITY TO GO FIT THEY ARE 
OPERATING AT AROUND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE IT HAS 
BEEN AN UP AND DOWN RACE IN TERM OF 
THE PACE THERE IS INTERESTING ON 
WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE FRONT WE 
ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON WHAT IS GOING 
ON BEHIND THE LEADING GROUP WITH 
THIS BRITISH CONTINGENT RUNNING FOR 
THEIR PLACE IN THE OLYMPIC TEAM 
ONE SPOT I THINK AVAILABLE THE 
SELECTORS WILL MAKE THEIR DECISION 
WITH PAULA RADCLIFFE COMING BACK TO 
FITNESS AND MARA YAMAUCHI IN GOOD 
FORM THEY LOOK ASURED OF THEIR 
PLACE ONE SPOT APPEARING TO BE 
AVAILABLE BETWEEN HAYLEY HAINING 
AND LIZ YELLING HAYLEY HAINING IS 
CLOSING DOWN ON LIZ YELLING HAS 
SHE GONE TOO QUICK ON THE EARLIER 
STAGES HAYLEY HAINING FROM GLASGOW 
VET WHO SAYS THAT WELL THIS IS 
ALMOST A BONUS SHE STILL ALMOST 
CONSIDERS HERSELF NOT TO BE FULL 
TIME AT LEITH IT IS ALMOST A HOBBY 
FOR HER SHE HAS A FULL TIME JOB 
SHE RUNS SIX HUNDRED FORTY TO SEVENTY MILES WEEK 
MOST WEEKS BECAUSE OF THE INJURY 
PROBLEMS AN OLYMPIC BIRTH WITHIN 
HER SIGHTS LIZ YELLING IS ZERO 
SECOND THAT IS GAP THERE CLOSE 
TORT ACTION IS PETER ELLIOT LIZ 
LOOKING AS THOUGH SHE IS WORKING 
HARD PETER I DON'T KNOW IF PETER 
CAN HEAR ME THERE 
I CAN HEAR YOU 
STEVE CAN YOU HEAR ME 
IT LOOKS AS 
THOUGH LIZ IS WORKING PRETTY HARD 
AT THE MOMENT 
LIZ WAZ WORKING 
INAUDIBLE HAYLEY LOOKING AT HOW 
SHE IS RUNNING SHE SEEMS TO BE 
RUNNING VERY COMPOSED TAKING 
CHECKING HER WATCH AT THE MILE 
SPLITS WHETHER LIZ WILL BE 
SUFFERING FROM THAT EARLY START 
WHEN SHE WENT OFF WITH THE LEADING 
GROUP WHERE HAYLEY IS STICKING TO 
HER PLAN THE GAP IS REDUCING ALL 
THE TIME STEVE 
THAT IS GOING TO BE FASCINATING TO 
WATCH WATCH A LOT AT STAKE FOR THOSE BRITISH 
ATHLETES THE CHANCE TO COMPETE IN 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES LIZ YELLING WAS 
THE FIRST BRITISH FINISHER IN 
ATHENS AFTER PAULA RADCLIFFE 
DROPPED OFF SHE CONSIDERS HERSELF 
AS SHE APPROACHED THIS RACE TO BE 
BETTER PREPARED THAN AT ANY OTHER 
TIME IN HER CAREER HAS SHE GOT HER 
TACTICS WRONG DID SHE GET INVOLVED 
IN THE LEAD GROUP TOO MUCH IN THE 
EARLY STAGE WAS THE PACE TOO QUICK 
FOR HER HAYLEY HAINING THE LAST 
TWO OR THREE YEARS BEEN BACK TO 
COMPETING AT THIS LEVEL HAS SHE 
GOT HER TACTICS RIGHT WE WILL KEEP 
AN EYE ON THAT FOR YOU FASCINATING 
THERE SHE IS HAYLEY HAINING AS 
SOON AS AT CERTAIN POINTS SHE CAN 
SEE LIZ YELLING AHEAD OF HER HER 
CONFIDENCE WILL RISE HAYLEY HAYLEY HAINING TAKING A SENSIBLE APPROACH 
SHE IS RUNNING UNDER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY RUNNING 
FASTER THAN SHE HAS EVER RUN BEFORE 
LIZ YELLING IS RUNNING FASTER THAN 
SHE HAS EVER RUN BEFORE BALT FOR 
THE PLACE IN BEIJING TO JOIN PAULA 
RADCLIFFE AND YAMAUCHI THIS WILL 
MAKE A STRONG WOMENS TEAM FOR THE 
MARATHON AND OLYMPIC GAMES WILL IT 
BE THE SCOTS WOMAN HAYLEY HAINING 
WHO STARTD OFF HER CAREER WITH 
BEING COMPETITIVE WITH PAULA 
RADCLIFFE IN THE JUNIOR COMPETITION 
A LOT OF INJURIES AND FOUND HERSELF 
WAY BACK TO THE SPORT THROUGH 
RECOGNISE CAATIONAL APPROACH HERE 
SHE IS APPROACHING THE POINT SEVENTEEN 
MILES APPROACHING THE POINT WHERE 
SHE HAS POTENTIAL PLACE HERE IN THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES THERE IS LIZ YELLING 
SHE CAN SEE HER NOW THE QUESTION 
IS CAN HAINING STAY STUFF AND 
STRONG AND MOVE GRADUALLY TOWARDS 
LIZ YELLING AND DOES LIZ YELLING 
KNOWLE EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON 
BEHIND HER IS LIZ PAYING THE PRICE 
FOR THE EARLIER OVEREXUBERANCE

ATMOSPHERE IS EXCITING CAN YOU 
JUST FEEL THE ATMOSPHERE EVEN FROM 
HERE HERE WHILST WE LEAVE CUTTY SARK WE ARE 
DOWN TO THE MEN'S RACE WHO ARE 
OPERATING AT AN AMAZING RACE 
RICHARD WE TALKED ABOUT THEM GOING 
AT WORLD RECORD PACE THERE SEEMS 
TOO MANY TO BE INVOLVED IN A RACE 
WHERE THEY ARE RUNNING AT TWO HOURS THREE 
PACE 
IT IS A BIG GROUP NINE PACE ATHLETES PLUS THE TWO PACEMAKERS L. 
THINK THE SIGNIFICANT THING IS THAT 
THERE IS A VERY BIG GAP BETWEEN 
THIS LEADING GROUP AND THE SECOND 
GROUP WHICH IS WHERE 
KIBET IS 
GROUP WHICH IS WHERE LUKE KIBET IS A MINUTE DOWN THE FIELD SO THE 
RUNNER AT THE BACK OF THIS GROUP 
HE SLOWS DOWN OR RUNS ON HIS OWN OR 
STAYS WITH THE GROUP THE CHOICE OF 
ALL THE ATHELETES IS GET A. R. KA 
CARRIED ALONG WITH THE FAST PACE 
OPERATING TWO HUNDRED FOUR PACE 
TOO QUICK FOR 
A FEW OF THESE ATHELETES RICH RCH 
ARD ISN'T IT 
CAN YOU HEAR ME I I CAN HEAR YOU THAT IS TOO QUICK FOR 
SOME OF THESE ATHLETES SURELY L. 
THINK IT IS MARTIN LEL WHO WON 
LAST YEAR HE LOOKS VERY VERY 
COMFORTABLE I THINK HE JUST KNOWS 
THIS RACE HE KNOWS ALSO THAT THE 
RACE IS OFTEN VERY FAST THEY OFTEN 
GO THROUGH THE HALF WAY AT WORLD 
RECORD PACE L. CAN JUST SEE IN HIS 
FACE THAT HE'S HOLDING HIMSELF BACK 
KNOWING THAT THE RACE ACTUALLY 
DOESN'T START UNTIL THE LAST FIVE 
MILES SOMEBODY WHO IS RUNNING THIS 
FOR THE FIRST TIME I SENSE HE IS 
GOING TO COME APART BECAUSE HE HAS 
TWO POINT OH SIX HUNDRED FIFTY HE DOESN'T QUITE HAVE THE 
EXPERIENCE TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW FAST 
IT IS AT THIS STAGE OF THE RACE 
THAT IS INTERESTING TO SAY THAT 
MARTIN LEL LAST YEAR'S WINNER 
OPERATING HERE AT WORLD RECORD PACE 
AND RICHARD SAYS HE LOOKS AS IF HE 
IS HOLDING HIMSELF BACK HE MUST BE 
I. N. FANTASTIC SHAPE IF THAT IS THE 
CASE AN IMMENSE RACE HERE WHEN HE 
GET PAST THE HALF WAY POINT THOSE 
FAMOUS BLACK AND WHITE SHIRTS 
DISAPPEAR STEVE LET RACE WILL BE 
EXCITING THINGS WILL CHANGE 
DRAMATICALLY DRAMATICALLY I'M TEMPTED TO SAY ONE WOULDN'T BE 
DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THE BLACK AND 
WHITE SHIRTS DISAPPEAR THAT IS FOR 
PACE MAKING REASONS OF COURSE 
NOTHING ELSE INTERESTING THE 
COMMENTS FROM RICHARD THERE IS A 
REAL MIX THERE OF INCREDIBLE 
EXPERIENCE AND YOU HAVE THE LIKES 
THE MERGA HAS RUN FOUR MARATHONS 
IT IS A BIG RISK 
AND AND M. A N. J. R. U. TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE 
BIG RISKS BEING TAKEN HERE 
RISKING THIS BLISTERING PACE 
RICHARD IS RIGHT AS WELL WE HAVE 
SEEN QUICK PACE THEN THE ATHLETES 
SLOW DOWN AS THE PACEMAKERS DROP 
OUT WE HAVE SEEN PACEMAKERS KEEP 
FORCING IT SO FAR THAT ONE OR TWO 
HAVE JUST ABOUT WON THE RACE IN THE 
PAST FAMOUSLY I THINK THE WORLD 
RECORD IN BERLIN THE PACEMAKER WENT 
ALL THE WAY I WAS TRYING TO THINK 
WHO WAS THAT WAS KAREA IF THEY 
STAY WITH THIS RACE LONG WAY AND 
PUSH THE PACE WE COULD BE IN FOR 
SOMETHING VERY QUICK HERE THE 
CONDITIONS THE ONE BIG DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR 
WHEN THEY DID SLOW DOWN IS THE 
CONDITIONS IT IS NOT NEARLY AS 
WARM AS LAST YEAR ANOTHER QUICK 
MILE THERE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TWO NOT TOO FAR FROM 
THE HALF WAY POINT CROSS TOWER 
BRIDGE AND THE HALF WAY MARK GOOD 
INDICATION THEN OF HOWL QUICKLY 
THESE GUYS ARE GOING CANARY WHARF RESPLENDENT IN THE 
SUNSHINE THIS IS WHERE THE COURSE 
HAS CHANGED SLIGHTLY IN RECENT 
YEARS YEARS ONE OR TWO TWISTY TURNS WHICH HAS 
PERHAPS SLOWED THEM DOWN SOMEONE 
HAS STOPPED THERE WAS THAT 
MIKITENKO THERE WAS ALFALL 
YAMAUCHI WENT DOWN 
MIKITENKO DIDN'T GO DOWN SHE IS 
STILL ON HER FEET ADEER YA HAS 
SHE GOT BACK ON HER FEET THERE IS

PERHAPS WE WILL GET A CHANCE TO 
HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT AT THAT 
DRINK STATION NOW THAT AT THIS 
STAGE OF THE RACE IS NOT WHAT YOU 
WANT SHE IS GOOD ENOUGH SHE IS 
THE PRE RACE FAVOURITE THAT IS NOT 
WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE SHE DOESN'T 
LOOK HURT LET'S LOOK AT THIS THIS 
IS AFTER IT HAPPENED SHESM HAS GONE

EDINBURGH THE OTHER ETHIOPIAN AT LEITH 
HE FELL HIS SHOE CAME OFF HE PUT 
HIS SHOE CAME BACK ON ONE HUNDRED FIFTY METRES 
START HE WENT AFTER THEM CLOSED 
THE GAP AND WON THE RACE 
ADERE OF ETHIOPIA KNOW THAT IS ONE 
OF THE BIG DANGERS W. A. M. I. HAS BEEN IN 
TROUBLE GOING THROUGH THE CANARY 
WHARF AREA THIS IS DRAMATIC FROM A 
DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW 
DRAMA THROUGH CANARY WHARF WE MIGHT 
HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE 
RACE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED 
THERE THERE THERE IS LIZ YELLING WHAT ABOUT 
THE RACE FOR THE TEAM IN THE 
BRITISH TEAM FOR BEIJING FOR THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES HAYLEY HAINING

IN AUGUST THERE IS ABYU IN THE RED 
VEST BEHIND HIM BEHIND HIM THERE

NAME ON THE FRONT 
LEATHER BYE FROM AUSTRALIA 
ABYU RUN A QUICK TIME IN DUBLIN 
ALONGSIDE THE RUSSIA RUSSIAN 
THERE WITH HIM THE TIME WASN'T 
RATIFIED WHICH MEANS ABYU HAS TO 
RUN UNDER TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN MUST RUN UNDER TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN 
TO JOIN DAN ROBINSON IN THE OLYMPIC 
TEAM THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER 
THERE IS THE LEADING GROUP LUKE 
KIBET ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN BEHIND THAT WILL EARLY 
EARLY PACE THIS IS THE WOMENS RACE 
HAINING MAKING MORE PROGRESS 
HAYLEY HAINING RUNNING STRONGLY 
MOVING THROUGH THE FIELD NOW JUST 
PASSING ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THE ATHLETE WHO LIVES 
AND TRAINS LOT OF HER TIME IN 
JAPAN HAINING LOOKS POWERFUL SHE 
IS GRADUALLY AND RELENTLESSLY 
PICKING OFF THE YARDS AND SECONDS 
MOVING TOWARDS LIZ YELLING 
YELLING WHO IS GOING THROUGH 
ROUGH POINT SO FAR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MINUTE 
NOOSE THE RACE RUNNING UNDER TWO 
HOURS ZERO PACE THE RACE FOR BEIJING 
THERE GOES HAYLEY HAINING AHEAD OF 
HER SHE WILL SEE WHEN SHE LOOKS UP 
SHE WILL SEE THE FIGURE OF LIZ 
YELLING THAT IS EVOLVING GRADUALLY 
AND INTERESTINGLY WELL BACK IN CANARY WHAT ARE THIF 
IS ACTUALLY A FORMER CHAMPION WHO 
WE UNDERSTAND IS BACK IN FOURTH 
PLACE OR THERE ABOUTS THE SWISS 
ATHLETE SANDRA GRAF LEADING FROM 
AMANDA MCGROURY OF THE UNITED 
STATES SHELLEY WOODS IS A MINUTE 
OR SO BEHIND THE DEFENDING 
CHAMPION CHAMPION EXPECTED TO FIGURE WITH THE LEADING 
GROUP GROUP THE REST ARE MILES BEHIND SHE IS 
CURRENTLY IN FOURTH PLACE TANNI 
IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH YEAR FOR HER 
SHE ISN'T AT HER BEST CAN YOU SEE 
FRANCESCA IS STRUGGLING AT THIS 
POINT SHE HAS BEEN AWAY FROM THE 
WOMENS PACT FROM A LONG TIME SHE 
HAS TO GET HER HEAD DOWN AND GET 
HOME HERE THEY ARE IN THE WOMENS LEAD 
MIKITENKO AND INTERESTING NEWS AT 
THE WHACK BACK OF THE GROUP IN THE 
RED VEST WE CAN JUST SEE WE CAN 
SEE THE FIGURE THE TINY FIGURE IN 
THE RED AND VEST THAT IS W. A. M. I. THE 
FORMER WORLD CHAMPION SHE FELL 
GOING THROUGH CANARY WHARF SHE 
DUSTED HERSELF OFF AND GRADUALLY 
AND SENTSIBLY HAS NOW WORKED HER 
WAY BACK TO THAT LEADING GROUP 
NOTICED ADERE IN THE YELLOW FEST 
VEST LOOKED OVER HER SHOULDER AND 
SAW W. A. M. I. APPROACHING SHE HAS 
OVERCOME THAT LITTLE FALL SHE HAS 
OBVIOUSLY BEEN SHAKEN A LITTLE BITE 
IT SALOM HAS NOT COME BACK AT ALL 
TOWARDS THE LEADING GROUP ADERE 
HITS THE FRONT SHE CAN SEE HER 
TEAM MATE W. A. M. I. WHO IS RUBBING HER 
LEG I WONDER IF SHE HURT HERSELF 
IF SHE FELL SHE HAS DONE WELL TO 
GET BACK TO THIS POINT HAS SHE 
CONSERVED HER ENERGY AND NOT TOO 
BADLY AFFECTED BY THAT FALL 
MIKITENKO WANTS TO TRY AND RUN A 
BAY AWAY FROM THIS FIELD SHE IS 
HAVING DIFFICULTY DOING IT SHE HAS 
TWO OUTSTANDING ETHIOPIAN ATHLETES 
BEHIND HER ADEER WHY ADEER WHY 
AND W. A. M. I. RUBBING HER RIGHT QUAD L. 
WONDER IF THERE IS REAL TROUBLE 
THERE SHE LOOKS COMFORTABLE 
INTERESTING ISN'T IT REMEMBER 
LAST YEAR ADERE SUFFERED HIP 
PROBLEMS DURING THE RACE AND FELL 
BACK DRAMATICALLY AND WAS INJURED 
FOR A PERIOD AFTER LONDON IT DID 
HER SOME HARM COMPLETING THE RACE 
WITH W. A. M. I. WOULD HAVE BEEN A SHOE IN 
FOR THE ETHIOPIAN TEAM ANY WAY SHE 
MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A KNOCK WHEN SHE 
WENT DOWN JUST WATCHING PE TROVE 
YA THE RUSSIA WHO IS ALWAYS THERE 
OR THERE ABOUT HER TEAM MATE THERE 
MIKITENKO PUSH IT ON PETROVA IS 
CERTAINLY ONE OF THE OLDEST 
COMPETITORS COMPETITORS THIRTY NINE YEARS OF AGE PERFORMING WELL 
INDEED INDEED GOOD TO SEE HER IN THAT LEAD GROUP 
COS KIE AT THE BACK WENT ADRIFT A 
COUPLE OF TIMES MIKITENKO TRYING 
TO FORCE THE PACE THE GERMAN HAS 
BEEN KEEN TO KEEP THE PACE MOVING 
ALONG CAME INTO THIS RACE WITH A 
LOT OF CONFIDENCE 
JUST STRETCHING THEM OUT A LITTLE 
BIT NOW THIS IS THE POINT OF THE 
RACE WHERE YOU STOORT THINK ABOUT 
HOW YOU ARE FEELING 
THE MILES TICK AWAY INTO THE LAST 
SIX MILES 
THINGS THEN CAN START TO HAPPEN A 
LONG WAY YET TO GO WITH SO MUCH 
TALENT IN THAT LEAD GROUP IT WOULD 
BE A HIGH RISK STRATEGY TO MAKE A 
MOVE AT THIS EARLY STAGE 
GOOD HALF AN HOUR OF RUNNING LEFT 
IN THIS WOMENS ELITE RACE 
WOMENS RACE EVOLVING THERE A VERY 
COMPETITIVE MENS RACE WE HAVE GOT 
TO THE HALF WAY POINT IN THE MENS 
RACE IN SIXTY TWO MINUTES AND THIRTEEN SECONDS 
SIXTY TWO POINT ONE THREE IN THE MENS RACE THAT IS 
WORLD RECORD PACE THAT IS TWO 
HOURS FOUR PACE FOR THE MARATHON IF 
YOU THINK ABOUT IT ONLY FIVE MEN 
HAVE EVER RUN UNDER TWO HOURS SIX FOR 
THE MARATHON NINE ARE RUNNING AT 
WORLD RECORD PACE THIS COULD BE A 
PHENOMENAL RACE ONE SECONDS NLT 
SECOND PART THERE WILL BE DRAMATIC 
CHANGES THE GROUP GOING DOWN THE 
PACEMAKERS DOING GOOD JOB 
NUMBERS DRIFTING OFF AT THE BACK 
MARK RAMALLAH DRIFTING OFF AT THE BACK THE LEADING GROUP IN THE MENS RACE 
WORLD RECORD PACE 
THE RECORD OF EXACTLY TWENTY FOUR POINT TWO SIX THEY 
HAVE GONE THROUGH IN TWENTY TWO POINT ONE THREE THAT THAT IS HOW THINGS ARE MOVING AT THE 
FRONT AT THE BACK IT IS TRE 
INTERESTING AT THE BACK IT IS VERY INTERESTING RILEY A FURTHER MINUTE FIFTEEN ADRIFT OF 
DAN ROBINSON 
BOTH RACES AS FAR AS THE BRITISH 
OLYMPIC TEAM VERY INTERESTING AT 
THIS STAGE DAN ROB INNSON 
UNDERSTANDS HE HAS A POSITION BUT 
THE OTHERS AIMING TO PICK UP A SPOT 
IN THAT TEAM WE WILL BRING YOU UP 
TO DATE WITH LIZ YELLING AND HAYLEY 
HAINING SHORTLY WE WILL DO THAT IN 
A SECOND AS WE LOOK FURTHER BACK 
DOWN THE COURSE AND SEE WHAT IS 
GOING ON 
CUTTY SARK ONE OF THE FAMOUS POINTS 
ON THIS COURSE SO MANY GREAT 
ADVANTAGE POINTS TO BE FAIR THEY 
ARE NOT SEEING MUCH OF CUTTY SARK 
UNDERGOING RESTORATION AFTER THE 
FIRE WHICH ALMOST DESTROYED THE 
FAMOUS TEA CLIPPER WHAT THEY ARE 
SEEING SOME HORDINGS AROUND THERE 
THE COST OF REPAIRING CUTTY SARK 
EXPECTED TO BE TEN MILLION COMING 
FROM THE HERITAGE LOTTERY FUND 
THE WOMENS LEAD NOW 
MIKITENKO BEING KEEN TO PRESS THE 
PACE ALONG BEGINNING TO MOVE THERE 
THE SMALL FIGURE OF W. A. M. I. OF 
ETHIOPIA ETHIOPIA A FEW MILES AGO SHE HAD A FALL SHE 
GOT UP SHE CAME BACK NOW GEETY 
W. A. M. I. LEADS IN THE WOMENS RACE 
LOOK AT THIS THERE ARE STILL WHAT 
SIX ATHLETES THERE 
NAUL WITH A CHANCE OF WINNING ALL 
IN WITH A CHANCE OF WINNING THE 
WHEELCHAIR MARATHON INTERESTING 
PROSPECT THE FINISH GANTRY FOR THE 
WHEELCHAIRS IS NOT BROAD ENOUGH TO 
GET SIX ATHLETES UNDERNEATH AT THE 
SAME TIME 
IT WILL BE AN 
INTERESTING SPRINT FACE IT'S ALL 
ABOUT WHAT TIMING THEY DO COMING 
ROUND THE CORNER IN THAT FINAL TURN 
IT IS HARD LAST COUPLE OF HUNDRED 
METRES FOR THE FINISH LINE IT IS A 
SLIGHT INCLINE IT IS ABOUT THE LINE 
THEY TAKE AROUND THE CORNER IT'S 
LIKE CYCLING YOU WANT TO BE IN A 
GOOD POSITION IN THE PACK YOU DON'T 
WANT TO LEAD THE SPRINT OUT YOU 
WANT TO SIT ON ONE'S WHEEL WHO WILL 
GO FAST THEY WILL SIT ON DAVE WEIR 
AND WATCH FOR HIM HE WILL WANT TO LOOK AT DAVE AND 
FOLLOW DAVE THROUGH 
DAVID WEIR 
LEADS THEM ROUND HE IS IN THE ALL 
RED NEXT TO HIM IS ERNST VAN DYK 
IN THE VEL YELLOW BEHIND DYKE IS 
KURT FEARNLEY IT IS BUILDING UP 
NICELY WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE 
EXPERTS WHO IS YOUR MONEY ON EVEN EVEN RIGHT NOW IT WILL BE HARD DAVE 
WEIR STARTED HIS KICK HE IS VERY 
STRONG HE TIMED IT WELL HE KICKED 
COMING OUT OF THE BEND WHICH WILL 
MAKE IT TOUGH FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO 
FOLLOW HE IS LEADING ERNST VAN 
DYK OH MY GOODNESS 
THERE HAS 
BEEN A CRASH DAVID WEIR WINS IT 
WHAT A FINISH WE ALL KNEW IT WAS 
GOING TO BUILD UP TO BE A CRACKING 
FINISH WESM DIDN'T EXPECT THIS 
DRAMA DRAMA ERNST VAN DYK THERE THAT IS A 
DESPERATE CRASH FOR THE SOUTH 
AFRICAN 
JOSHUA GEORGE BOTH HIS AFRICAN TYRES HAVE COME OUT IT IS A TOUGH 
FINISH FOR FOR THOSE GUYS HE IS 
BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND HE IS GOING 
TO FINISH DRAMATIC FINISH TO THE 
END OF THE WHEELCHAIR RACE NO NO DOUBT ABOUT THE WINNER OF REPEAT 
SUCCESS FOR DAVID WEIR HE HAS WON 
THREE IN A ROW WHAT A DES PER 
RAILTRACK RATE SITUATION FOR THAT 
MAN HE CAME AS ONE OF THE 
FAVOURITES TO GET A TOP THREE PLACE 
DID JOSHUA GEORGE LIMPSOR THE LINE 
HIS WHEELCHAIR IN TATTERS A LITTLE BIT OF DRAMA IN THE 
WOMEN'S RACE NOW WE HAVE A 
BREAKAWAY GROUP OF THREE MIKITENKO 
WE HAVE BEEN SAYING HAS BEEN 
FORCING THE PACE AT WHATEVER 
OPPORTUNITY SHE HAS AND IS DOING IT 
AGAIN SHE HAS DRIFTED THROUGH WITH 
GETA W. A. M. I. WHO DECIDED SHE 
RECOVERED FROM HER FALL AND WANTED 
TO MOVE MOVE THINGS ON MIKITENKO TAKES 
HAD NO 
HESITATION IN PICKING UP THE 
INVITATION AND THAT WAS SOMETHING 
WHICH THEY COULDN'T RESIST A BIT 
OF A GAP THEN 
SALINA KOSGEI AS WELL DRIFTING AWAY 
IN THE DISTANCE THIS IS A BRAVE 
ATTEMPT FROM MIKITENKO TO PUSH 
THINGS ON HERE AND GETA W. A. M. I. 
WATCHING A LITTLE GAP THERE A 
COUPLE OF METRES ARE SO WILL IT BE MIKITENKO THIS YEAR 
GETA W. A. M. I. LOOKING BEHIND AND SEEING 
WHAT DAMAGE THE GERMAN'S DOING 
IT'S SUBSTANTIAL THEY'RE MOVING 
AWAY QUICKLY 
GAPS ARE OPENING 
GETA W. A. M. I. AFTER PICKING HERSELF UP 
AND CATCHING THE GROUP MIKITENKO 
IS PULLING THEM AWAY FROM ADERE 
ONE OF THE BIG FAVOURITES THE 
OTHER ETHIOPIAEN ATHLETE GETA W. A. M. I. 
HAS NOW COME TO SETTLE IN THE 
MARATHON WE HAVE SEEN HER RUN OVER 
THE YEARS FANTASTIC RACES ON THE 
COUNTRY BATTLES WITH PAULA 
RADCLIFFE AND FIRST AND SECOND 
PLACES ON MANY OCCASIONS WE HAVE 
SEEN THEM RUN ON THE TRACK WHERE 
GETA W. A. M. I. BEAT PAULA RADCLIFFE IN 
SEVILLE AND A CLASSIC BATTLE IN NEW 
YORK LAST YEAR WHERE PAULA 
RADCLIFFE PREVAILED AND BEAT GETA 
W. A. M. I. GETA W. A. M. I. IS JANE OUTSTANDING 
ATHLETE AN OUTSTANDING ATHLETE IN 
EVERY SENSE LOOKING GOOD IN SECOND PLACE 
CALMLY MOVED BACK TO THE GROUP 
AFTER SHE FELL IN CANARY WHARF 
MIKITENKO LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER 
I NOTICE THERE SHE LOOKED BEYOND 
GETA W. A. M. I. LOOKING TO SEE HOW MANY 
OTHERS ARE IN CONTENTION SHE IS 
SEEING SVETLANA ZAKHAROVA ON THE 
EDGE OF IT L. WOULD IMAGINE SHE 
WILL BE NERVOUS ABOUT GETA W. A. M. I. AN 
ATHLETE WHO FOR MANY YEARS HAS BEEN 
AN OUTSTANDING ATHLETE EVEN SINCE 
SHE WAS A JUNIOR 
YES AND WAS VERY 
MUCH PRE RACE FAVOURITE 
LIZ YELLING WE SEEN GOING THROUGH 
IN ELEVENTH PLACE THERE SHE IS 
WHAT'S THE GAP BETWEEN LIZ YELLING 
AND HAYLEY HAINING IT WAS CLOSING 
BUT I HAVE A FEELING WELL THERE 
IS HAYLEY HAINING L. THINK THAT GAP IS STARTING TO EXTEND A LITTLE BIT 
MAYBE HAYLEY HAS MADE THE EFFORT 
AND IS NOT ABLE TO CATCH ANY MORE 
PETER WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THERE 
THAT'S RIGHT ABOUT MILE BACK 
HAYLEY WAS CATCHING LIZ AS WE 
APPROACHED A ROUND ABOUT LIZ 
YELLING LOOKED OVER HER SHOULDER TO 
SEE SEE WHERE HAYLEY HAINING WAS 
AND CAUGHT GLIMPSE AND INJECTED A 
LITTLE BIT OF PACE AT AT ONE POINT 
IT WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS NOW WE ARE 
BACK TO TWENTY SHE STILL HAS LIZ IN 
HER SIGHTS AND LIZ HAS SIMILAR 
DISTANCE TO WORK OFF HAYLEY IS 
STILL LOOKING COMPOSED BUT 
OBVIOUSLY THE LOSS IN DISTANCE 
SHOWS IT MUST BE AFFECTING WELL WELL SHE WILL KEEP PLUGGING AWAY HAYLEY 
HAINING AND WILL PROBABLY HOPE 
WHATEVER EFFORT LIZ IS PUTTING IN 
TO MOVE AWAY MIGHT COME BACK TO 
HAUNT HER BUT LIZ IS STRONG SHE'S 
PUT THE MILES IN AND HAYLEY HAINING 
JUST YOU CAN SEE HER GLANCING ALL 
THE TIME YOU CAN SEE THE OLYMPIC 
PLACE TANTALISINGLY CLOSE JUST THIRTY 
SECONDS PERHAPS LESS AHEAD OF 
BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S 
MOVE AWAY FROM HER AND DOES SHE 
HAVE THE ABILITY TO PICK UP THE 
PACE A LITTLE OR AT LEAST FORCE 
THINGS TO PUT SOME PRESSURE ON 
YELLING YELLING THAT ONE WILL BE ONE TO WATCH TO 
THE WIRE THEY'RE BOTH OPERATING 
STILL UNDER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY PACE THE 
LEADERS OPERATING UNDER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX AND IF 
ANYTHING SPEEDED UP A BIG GAP NOW 
BETWEEN THESE THREE AND THE 
FOLLOWING GROUP MIKITENKO HAS 
CERTAINLY SHAKEN THIS RACE UP AT 
THE MOMENT SHE ONLY HAS GETA W. A. M. I. 
AND ZAKHAROVA TO BE WORRIED ABOUT 
THE CROWD HERE ON TOWER BRIDGE ON 
THE TOP CHEERING THE ATHLETES GOING 
AROUND AND UNDERNEATH TOO GETTING 
GREAT SUPPORT THERE THEY ARE ON 
THE WAY BACK COMING OFF TOWER 
BRIDGE ONE WAY AND ON THE NEAR SIDE 
HERE THIS IS THE LEAD GROUP IN THE 
WOMEN'S RACE IT'S DOWN TO THREE 
WHO IS GOING TO WIN THIS ONE 
MIKITENKO'S FORCING IT GETA W. A. M. I. 
LOOKS COMFORTABLE IN SECOND PLACE 
ZAKHAROVA LOOKS LIKE SHE IS 
BATTLING FOR THAT THAT THIRD PLACE 
POSITION POSITION THOSE THREE AS THE CROWDS MILL 
AROUND THAT AREA WHICH IS A VERY 
GOOD VANTAGE POINT YOU CAN SEE THE 
RACE AT TWO IMPORTANT POINTS AFTER 
TWELVE MILES AND THEN AGAIN AFTER 
THAT'S SALINA KOSGEI OF KENYA 
SHE'S IN FOURTH PLACE PETROVA IN 
FIFTH PLACE 
BUT THE FIRST THREE ARE THERE 
I HAVE TO SAY THINGS CAN'T CHANGE 
IN A MARATHON THINGS CAN CHANGE 
IN A MARATHON BUT THE SMALL FIGURE 
OF GETA W. A. M. I. LOOKS EXTREMELY 
COMFORTABLE AT THIS POINT 
MIKITENKO YOU HAVE TO SAY SHE'S 
BEEN EXTREMELY BRAVE EVERY 
OPPORTUNITY SHE'S HAD SHE'S TRIED 
TO PUSH THE PACE SHE'S BEEN 
RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING THIS GROUP 
DOWN TO MANAGABLE NUMBERS HERE IS 
SALINA KOSGEI NOW OF KENYA COMING 
THROUGH SHE'S RUNNING STRONGLY 
SHE'S THE ATHLETE WHO SURPRISED US 
BY WINNING THE COMMONWEALTH GAMES 
IN MANCHESTER OVER TEN THOUSAND M. 
PREVIOUSLY WE HAD SEEN HER IN THE 
COMMONWEALTH GAMES RUNNING EIGHT HUNDRED M. SO 
GONE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED M. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TO TWENTY SIX MILES 
IN LONDON IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THERE IS PETROVA 
SHE'S WORKING HARD AND STRUGGLING 
BUT SHE'S BEEN PLACED WELL IN THE 
MARATHON OVER THE YEARS THEN TO 
THE NEXT GROUP THAT SHOULD BE VERY 
INTERESTING TO SEE THERE WE SEE 
SOUAD AIT SALEM WHO WITH GETA W. A. M. I. 
FELL OBVIOUSLY DONE HERSELF MORE 
DAMAGE THAN GETA W. A. M. I. 
AS WE WATCH 
THIS AND THERE IS LIZ YELLING 
RUNNING FOR THAT SPOT IN BEIJING 
YOU CAN SEE HAYLEY HAINING A FAIR 
DISTANCE BEHIND NOW DON'T BE TOO 
PUT OFF BY THE WAY LIZ LOOKS THERE 
I HAVE SEEN HER FORGING THROUGH THE 
MUD OF CROSS COUNTRY RACES LOOKING 
LIKE THAT AS WELL WE ALL HAVE DONE 
OVER THE YEARS THAT'S THE SIGN OF 
AN ATHLETE ALTHOUGH HAILLY LOOKS 
MORE HAYLEY LOOK LOOKS MORE 
COMPOSED IT'S A GOOD STORY FROM 
HAYLEY HAINING IT WOULD AND SHAME 
FOR HER TO GET SO CLOSE SHE SAID 
TO ME LOOK ALL OF THIS IS A BONUS 
AND EVEN IF I DON'T GET TO BEIJING 
I AM GOING TO KEEP TRAINING I AM 
GOING TO RUN PERHAPS ANOTHER 
MARATHON IN THE AUTUMN AS I SAID I 
AM SURE SHE SET OFF TODAY THINKING 
SHE HAD A CHANCE BUT PERHAPS KNEW 
IT WAS MORE DOWN TO WHETHER LIZ 
YELLING COULD COME BACK TO HER OR 
NOT THERE IS STILL RUNNING TO GO 
STILL A A GOOD FEW MILES ALONG THE 
EMBANKMENT WHERE WE HAVE SEEN A LOT 
OF THINGS HAPPEN OVER THE YEARS IF 
YOU ARE WATCHING THIS AND YOU THINK 
PAULA RADCLIFFE IS PERHAPS WATCHING 
THIS THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH HERE 
THAT WOULD HAVE FRIGHTENED YOU NOT 
SURPRISED AT THIS SORT OF PACE 
THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD MORE PEOPLE IN 
CONTENTION WITH THIS PACE SO THREE 
LEFT IN THE WOMEN'S RACE WHAT'S 
GOING ON IN THE MENACE RACE 
IN 
THE MEN'S RACE THE PACE BEGINNING TO QUICKEN THEY 
THOUGH AS THEY LOCK AS THOUGH 
THEY'RE TRACING EACH OTHER OFF THE 
PACK RYAN HALL THE AMERICAN HOPE 
HAS DRIFTED OFF THE BACK TOO THIS 
IS NOW DOWN TO THREE KENYANS MERGA 
OF ETHIOPIA AND SAMUEL WANJIRU LEL IN THE BLUE 
MUTAI IN YELLOW 
THE ATHLETES HERE ENJOYING THE 
WEATHER BACK AT THE FINISH WELL 
THE RAIN THE UMBRELLAS ARE UP 
THE RAIN IS BELTING DOWN THE 
ATHLETES OUT ON THE COURSE AREN'T 
REALLY EXPERIENCING THIS BUT LOOK 
IT LOOKS GRIM THERE 
TO BE HONEST 
THEY SAID SHOWERS L. AM GOING TO 
BRAG NOW I DID GO FOR A RUN 
YESTERDAY AND I HAD ABOUT A ONE 
MINUTE BURST TOWARDS THE END OF THE 
RUN I FELT LIKE IT WAS ALMOST HAIL 
STONES SO THE SHOWERS ARE KICKING 
AROUND THEY SOON PASS THE RUNNERS 
WON'T MIND TOO MUCH THERE YOU CAN 
SEE LOVELY WEATHER PICTURES OVER 
LONDON I AM SAYING LOVELY NOT 
SURE THE WEATHER IS LOVELY SHOW 
THE TEMPERATURES RISING TO ABOUT THIRTEEN 
C. BY THE TIME WE HAVE THE PEAK 
FINISH AT AROUND ONE TWO HUNDRED THEY 
CAN EXPECT TO GET WET BRENDAN I 
AM SORRY TO SAY 
A MAN OF MANY 
TALENTS STEVE 
WELL WE HAVE SOME FANTASTICALLY 
EXCITING RACE IN THE MEN MEN'S 
ELITE RACE 
THE ATHLETE IN FRONT THERE IS 
SANDRA GRAF OF SWITZERLAND WITH 
ONE OF THE MEN'S COMPETITORS HE IS 
GOING TO FINISH IN SIXTH OR SEVENTH WE 
THINK SANDRA GRAF HAS REUTEN TO A 
RIDDEN TO A SUPERB VICTORY HERE 
SHELLY WOODS WE UNDERSTAND IS STILL 
BACK IN THIRD PLACE AND SEPARATING 
THIS ATHLETE FROM SHELLY IS AMANDA 
MCGRORY FROM THE U. S. A. BUT THE SWISS 
ATHLETE HERE HAS RIDDEN SUPERBLY 
TODAY HASN'T SHE 
WELL FOR SANDRA IT'S A HUGE 
IMPROVEMENT IT'S TAKEN HER A LONG 
TIME TO GET TO HER BEST AND SHE'S 
BEEN IN THE SHADOW OF SOME OF THE 
BEST KNOWN SWISS ATHLETES 
BUT SHE WAS FIFTH IN THE SYDNEY 
PARALIMB PIKE MARATHON PARALIMB 
PIKE MAR SHAOPB PARALIMB 
PARALYMPIC MARATHON 
SHE'S BEEN BRAVE IN THIS SHE IS'S 
GONE OUT AND SPLIT THE FIELD APART 
IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
WHAT THE TIME IS WE WILL SEE THAT 
AS SHE GOES UNDERNEATH THE BARRIER 
ONE MORE TURN INTO THE MALL HERE COMES THE WOMEN'S CHAMPION AND 
A VERY WORTHY CHAMPION TOO 
SANDRA'S BEST IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY AT THE THIRTY K. 
MARK SHE WAS GOING TO BE ON THE 
COURSE RECORD BUT THE RAIN AFFECTS 
THE WHEELCHAIR ATHLETES AND IT'S 
HARD TO GET GRIP ON THE RAIN 
SANDRA GRAF SHE'S LATE DOWN A 
LAID DOWN A MARKER FOR WHAT COULD 
HAPPEN IN BEIJING AS TANNI WAS 
SAYING WORLD CHAMPION LAST YEAR 
NOW SHE IS'S GOING TO BECOME THE 
LONDON MARATHON WHEELCHAIR CHAMPION 
WAY AHEAD OF ANYBODY ELSE THE 
DEFENDING CHAMPION SHELLY WOODS HAS 
LOST GROUND PARTICULARLY IN THE 
SECOND HALF OF THE RACE WE 
UNDERSTAND SHE COULD BE AS MUCH AS 
TEN MINUTES DOWN ON THE LEADER AT 
THE MOMENT SANDRA GRAF FOR 
SWITZERLAND IS COMING HOME IT'S 
GOING TO BE A NEW COURSE RECORD 
SHE'S SMASHED IT SANDRA GRAF IS 
THE CHAMPION WITH A NEW COURSE 
RECORD SUPERB DRAMA IN THE WOMEN'S RACE WE CAME 
OUT OF THE TUNNEL ALONG THE 
EMBANKMENT AND EMERGING FROM THE 
DARKNESS CAME MIKITENKO OF GERMANY 
WITH LEAD OF ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AND 
ONLY SVETLANA ZAKHAROVA LOOKING 
LIKE SHE WANTS TO GIVE CHASE AS 
THEY EN WELL RAIN STARTING TO 
COME DOWN AS THEY COME ALONG THE 
EMBANKMENT AS THEY LOOK AT THIS 
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SEE BIG BEN IN 
THE DISTANCE AND MIKITENKO WILL BE 
THINKING OF THE FINISH LINE NOW 
GETA W. A. M. I. HER CHANCES APPEAR TO BE 
SLIPPING AWAY AS MIKITENKO FORCES 
THE PACE HERE THIS IS GREAT 
PERFORMANCE BRENDAN BERLIN LAST 
YEAR WAS A ONE TWO SHE SAID ON 
THAT DAY SHE FELT AS IF SHE WASN'T 
COMFORT TO GO WITH W. A. M. I. TODAY 
SHE'S BEEN FORCING IT AND IS NOW IN 
THE LEAD 
CERTAINLY HAS BEEN 
FORCING IT A COUPLE OF MILES AGO 
SHE LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE WAS UNDER 
PRESSURE AND GETA W. A. M. I. AFTER SHE 
PICKED HERSELF UP AND GOT BACK TO 
THE LEADING GROUP LOOKED EVERY BIT 
COMFORTABLE BUT NOW IT'S ALL 
CHANGE NOW IT'S ABOUT 
DETERMINATION IRINA MIKITENKO AT 
TWENTY FOUR MILES RELAXING DROPPING HER 
ARMS AND KEEPING GOING THEN SECOND 
PLACE SVETLANA ZAKHAROVA WHO 
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S BEEN BATTLING ALL 
THE WAY IN THE MEN'S RACE IT'S 
PRETTY EXCITING MARTIN LEL LAST 
YEAR'S WINNER SAMUEL WANJIRU THE 
WORLD RECORD HOLDER FOR THE HALF 
MARATHON THESE TWO ARE IN THE SAME 
POSITION AS THEY WERE LAST 
SEPTEMBER IN THE GREAT NORTH RUN 
FINISHING FIRST AND SECOND IN THAT 
LAST YEAR BUT NOW IT'S SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT THEY'VE GOT MORE COMPANY 
THE WOMEN'S RACE MIKITENKO LOOKS 
AS THOUGH SHE IS CLEAR THE MEN'S 
RACE IS STILL TREATMENTLY STILL 
EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE EIGHT MILES 
LEFT IN THE MENACE RACE MEN'S 
RACE THE WOMEN'S RACE A COUPLE OF 
MILES ALONG THE EMBANKMENT THEN 
PAST THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT IN 
THE MEN'S RACE IT'S GETTING 
EXTREMELY SERIOUS THIS IS 
COMPETITIVE THREE KENYANS IN THE 
FIRST THREE THEY SURELY WILL BE 
SELECTING THEMSELVES UNLESS 
SOMETHING OUTSTANDING HAPPENS IN 
BOSTON THE KENYAN SELECTORS ARE 
HERE IN FORCE LOOKING AT THIS RACE 
IT'S MARTIN LEL SAMUEL WANJIRU 
MUTAI OF KENYA BEHIND THE TWO OF 
THEM MERGA OF ETHIOPIA FIVE MEN 
RUNNING AS FAST AS WE HAVE EVER 
SEEN ANYBODY RUN BEFORE CERTAINLY 
FIVE REN RUNNING COMPETITIVE FIVE 
MEN RUNNING COMPETITIVELY LIKE THIS 
WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE IT'S IT'S FASCINATING ISN'T IT 
THEY'VE BEEN OPERATING AT WORLD 
RECORD PACE EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S 
AT STAKE OLYMPIC PLACES THE PRIZE 
MONEY ON OFFER HERE AND OF COURSE 
THE PRESTIGE IF NOTHING ELSE OF 
WINNING THE LONDON MARATHON MARTIN 
LEL HAS DONE IT TWICE BEFORE 
SAMUEL WANJIRU ATTEMPTING TO GET IN 
THERE LET'S GO BACK TO THE MALL AS 
WE SEE THE SECOND FINISH IN THE 
WOMEN'S WHEELCHAIR 
AMANDA MCGRORY 
FROM THE UNITED STATES BEHIND THE 
LEADER SANDRA GRAF OF SWITZERLAND 
NEVERTHELESS A GOOD RIDE FOR HER 
SHE'S DONE VERY WELL VERY FEW 
ATHLETES WOULD LIKE A COURSE TO BE 
MORE HILLY AMANDA LOVES HILLS AND 
LONDON IS PROBABLY TOO FLAT FOR HER 
SHE'S WON IN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO 
COME SECOND IN BOSTON AND NOW 
SECOND IN THE LONDON MARATHON SO SO GOOD FEW MINUTES BEHIND SANDRA GRAF 
BUT A GOOD RACE INDEED THE YOUNG 
AMERICAN JUST TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD FROM 
THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AND SHE 
WILL BE DELIGHTED WITH THAT 
PERFORMANCE PERFORMANCE IN THE WOMEN'S RACE MIKITENKO HAS 
AN EIGHT SECOND LEAD SVETLANA 
ZAKHAROVA HASN'T GIVEN THIS ONE UP 
WITH JUST OVER TWO KILOMETRES TO GO 
AROUND ABOUT A MILE AND HALF OF 
RUNNING A LITTLE BIT LESS 
SVETLANA ZAKHAROVA MIGHT STILL 
THINK SHE IS IN WITH CHANCE GETA 
W. A. M. I. WELL HER CHANCE HAS SLIPPED 
AWAY UNLESS THE TWO IN FRONT OF 
HER DRAMATICALLY START TO FADE 
CAN SEE MIKITENKO THERE SHE IS 
JUST STARTING TO SUFFER LITTLE 
BIT HAD A COUPLE OF LOOKS BACK TO 
SEE WHAT THE LEAD IS WAS SHE 
BUOYED BY THAT WAS SHE WORRIED BY 
WHAT SHE SAW BEHIND HER SHE MIGHT 
BE BUOYED BY THE FACT THAT GAP IS 
GETTING BIGGER AND MIKITENKO 
PUSHING ON NOW IT HURTS AT THIS 
POINT BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A LEAD AND 
YOU ARE MOVING AWAY YOU START TO 
FIND ENERGY RESERVES ALL OF THOSE 
MILES OF TRAINING THIS IS WHERE 
THEY COME TO PLAY THIS IS WHERE 
YOU REALLY FIND OUT WHAT YOUR LEVEL 
OF FITNESS IS THE LAST COUPLE OF 
MILES OF THE RACE IT'S BEEN 
SUPERB PERFORMANCE UP TO THIS POINT 
FROM IRINA MIKITENKO BECAME A 
GERMAN CITIZEN OVER TEN YEARS AGO 
AND HAS BEEN A GOOD COMPETITOR ON 
THE TRACK OVER FIVE THOUSAND TEN ZERO ZERO ZERO M. AND 
WHEN SHE RUN IN BERLIN LAST YEAR 
SHE FELT AS THOUGH SHE HAD A LOT 
MORE TO GIVE HAS WAITED UNTIL 
LONDON TO PROVE THAT SO MIKITENKO 
IN HER SECOND MARATHON LOOKS AS 
THOUGH SHE'S HEADING FOR A SUPERB 
VICTORY BUT THE RUSSIAN ZAC STKBG 
ZAC ALMOST SVETLANA ZAKHAROVA 
ALMOST A WARHORSE CERTAINLY KNOWS 
HOW TO COMPETE WELL 
MIKITENKO ONLY HER SECOND MARATHON 
A FABULOUS DEBUT IN BERLIN THE 
THIRD FASTEST GERMAN NOW IRINA 
MIKITENKO LOOKS AS THOUGH SHE MAY 
BE HEADING FOR HER FIRST MAJOR 
INTERNATIONAL VICTORY SHE'S BEEN A 
GOOD TEN ZERO ZERO ZERO M. RUNNER AND SEEN HER 
FOR MANY YEARS AS SHE TURNS AWAY 
FROM THE EMBANKMENT YOU CAN SEE 
THE RAIN DRIVING IN HER FACE 
THAT'S ACTUALLY COOLING HER DOWN 
THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT IN THE 
BACKGROUND AND IRINA MIKITENKO ONLY 
TEN MINUTES RUNNING AWAY FROM THE 
FINISH OR EVEN A LITTLE BIT LESS 
THAN THAT THE WOMEN'S RACE LOOKS 
AS THOUGH SHE REALLY ONLY HAS TO 
KEEP GOING TO WIN IT A LITTLE BIT 
OF A SURPRISE TO MANY WE KNEW SHE 
WAS GOOD BUT WE THOUGHT THE FIELD 
ITSELF WITH THE LIKES OF BERHANE 
ADERE AND GETA W. A. M. I. WAS GOING TO BE 
TOO STRONG WE KNOW SHE IS AIMING 
TO RUN WELL IN BEIJING WITH BIG 
BEN IN THE BACKGROUND THE LONDON 
MARATHON ONCE AGAIN THROWING UP 
REALLY INTERESTING INFORMATION THE 
FABULOUS NEWS FROM THE MEN'S RACE 
IS THAT THE MEN HAVE GONE THROUGH 
THIRTY K. M. MARTIN LEL IN THE LEAD AT THE 
TIME HE PROBABLY WON'T KNOW IT HE 
HAS RUN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE FOR AN AFRICAN RECORD 
TELLS YOU THAT THE MEN AND THERE 
IS A GROUP OF MEN RUNNING 
EXTREMELY QUICKLY THEY WON'T KNOW 
ABOUT RECORDS EN ROUTE WE HAVE 
ALREADY SEEN A RECORD IN THE LONDON 
MARATHON 
YOU CAN SEE LIZ YELLING MARATHON HAS MOVED INTO THE TOP TEN THREE 
MINUTES THIRTY EIGHT SECONDS BEHIND MIKITENKO 
STILL HEADING FOR AROUND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY 
WHICH WOULD BE A PERSONAL BEST AND 
AT THE MOMENT STILL LOOKS AS THOUGH 
SHE'S GOT THAT OLYMPIC PLACE IN THE 
BAG WITH LESS THAN TWO OR JUST 
OVER TWO KILL MEETERS TO GO FOR 
YELLOWSTONE TO GO FOR LIZ YELLING AT THE FRONT 
IT'S REALLY JUST A CASE OF HOLDING 
IT TOGETHER FOR MIKITENKO SHE 
COMES DOWN ALONGSIDE SAINT JAMES' PARK 
HEADING DOWN TOWARDS BUCKINGHAM 
PALACE AND OF COURSE AT THAT POINT 
THEY PRETTY MUCH KNOW IT'S IN THE 
BAG TAKES THE TURN INTO THE MALL 
AND THE VICTORY WILL BE HERS ONLY 
HER SECOND MARATHON THIS IS A 
SUPERB PERFORMANCE FROM THE GERMAN 
HAS BEAT AND VERY GOOD FIELD TODAY 
WE WILL WE WILL HAVE TO FIND OUT 
WHAT HAPPENED TO GETA W. A. M. I. YOU CAN 
SEE HER IN THE DISTANCE SHE IS 
STILL HOLDING HER HIP MAYBE SHE IS 
SUFFERING FROM THAT FALL SHE HAD 
CERTAINLY YOU WOULD HAVE SAID 
COMING INTO THIS RACE SHE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN THE FAVOURITE AND IF YOU 
SAID THE RACE WAS GOING TO BE RUN 
IN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THAT CERTAINLY WOULD 
HAVE BEEN THE CASE YOU COULDN'T 
REALLY SEE ANYONE BEATING GETA W. A. M. I. 
IN THESE CONDITIONS BUT 
NONETHELESS THE GERMAN HAS COME AND 
PERFORMED SUPERBLY WELL SHE SHE CERTAINLY HAS THE RAIN DRIVING 
DOWN NOW KEEPING THESE ATHLETES 
COOL FOR ONE BUT IRINA MIKITENKO 
YOU COULD TELL SHE WAS GOING WELL 
WHEN SHE STARTED STRETCHING IT'S 
FIELD IN THE MIDDLE GOT THEM DOWN 
TO A GROUP OF SIX WORKED HARD AND 
GOT DOWN TO A GROUP LESS THAN THAT 
SHE IS SWINGING HER ARMS GETTING 
HERSELF GOING FOURTH IN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP FIVE ZERO ZERO ZERO M. FIFTH IN THOSE 
OLYMPIC GAMES AND HERE SVETLANA 
ZAKHAROVA OF RUSSIA IN SECOND 
PLACE WITH SIX HUNDRED METRES REMAINING WE 
SEE THE SMALL FIGURE APPROACHING 
THAT POINT QUITE HONESTLY WE 
THOUGHT GETA W. A. M. I. MIGHT WIN THIS 
ONE SHE'S LOOKING FORWARD TO 
BEIJING LATER IN THE YEAR YOU SEE 
THE SIGN OVERHEAD COMING AROUND 
THE BEND HERE IS IRINA MIKITENKO OF 
GERMANY HER FIRST MAJOR VICTORY AT 
INTERNATIONAL SHE'S BEEN A VERY 
GOOD INTERNATIONAL WORLD CLASS 
DISTANCE RUNNER PARTICULARLY OVER 
FIVE ZERO ZERO ZERO M. ON THE TRACK NOW SHE COMES 
INTO THE MALL WHERE THE SPECTATORS 
HAVE NOW TAKEN UNDER THEIR 
UMBRELLAS SHE SETTLES DOWN TWO HUNDRED M. 
REMAINING NOW SHE RELAXES AND 
SETTLES DOWN SHE'S STILL RUNNING 
STRONGLY VERY CLOSE TO HER 
PERSONAL BEST THERE SHE GOES 
IRINA MIKITENKO TO WIN THIS YEAR'S 
LONDON MARATHON 
A SUPERB 
PERFORMANCE THISS ABOUT THIS HAS BEEN A 
SUPERB PERFORMANCE BY IRINA 
MIKITENKO PUT PAID TO ALL THE 
ETHIOPIAEN HOPES AND WINS THE 
LONDON MARATHON TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
MIKITENKO OF GERMANY THE SURPRISE 
WINNER OF THIS YEAR'S LONDON 
MARATHON AND AN EXCELLENT TIME AND 
MIKITENKO SAID SHE COULD COME HERE 
AND RUN QUICK SHE'S RUN A PERSONAL 
BEST AND HAS WON A RACE WHICH MANY 
WOULD HAVE DOUBTED HER ABILITY TO 
DO SO SVETLANA ZAKHAROVA ONCE MORE 
PERFORMING REALLY WELL THAT'S ONE 
OF HER BEST RACES FOR A WHILE THE 
RUSSIAN TAKING SECOND PLACE INSIDE 
TWO POINT TWO FIVE AND THAT INJECTION OF PACE 
OVER THE LAST THREE MILES FROM 
MIKITENKO PUT PAID TO THE CHANCES 
OF MANY OF THE BIG NAMES BEHIND 
GETA W. A. M. I. WILL TAKE THE THIRD SPOT 
AND WILL BE AND WE WILL BE 
LOOKING WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND THESE 
TWO MIKITENKO PERHAPS CAN'T 
BELIEVE THE FACT SHE'S WON THERE 
IS GETA W. A. M. I. SHE TOOK A SERIOUS 
FALL AND CERTAINLY WAS SERIOUSLY 
IMPAIRED AT CANARY WHARF THEN GOT 
HERSELF BACK INTO THE RACE SHE'S 
BEEN CLUTCHING HER HIP EVERY NOW 
AND THEN PERHAPS SHE'S RUNNING 
WITH A PROBLEM WE WILL FIND OUT AT 
THE END OF THE RACE FROM HER NOT 
ONE OF HER BEST PERFORMANCES AND 
GETA W. A. M. I. HOPEFULLY DOESN'T LOOK 
AS THOUGH SHE'S RUNNING TOO BADLY 
THERE ALTHOUGH SHE'S SUCH A SMOOTH 
RUNNER AT THE BEST OF TIMES WE 
WILL BE LOOKING FOR LIZ YELLING 
APPROACHING THE FINISH LINE SHE IS 
IN THE TOP TEN NOW LOOKING AS 
THOUGH SHE'S GOT THAT OLYMPIC PLACE 
IN THE BAG GETA W. A. M. I. LIMPING THERE 
THAT'S A SERIOUS I AM SURE SHE 
WILL TELL US THAT IS WHAT CAUSED 
THE PROBLEM IN THE LATER STAGES A 
BIG FALL AT CANARY WHARF AND SHE'S 
DONE WELL TO FINISH IN THIRD PLACE 
IF THAT'S THE CASE SALINA KOSGEI 
THE KENYAN FIRST KENYAN TO FINISH 
HERE AS BRENDAN WAS SAYING WITH 
THE KENYAN SELECTORS HERE SHE SAID 
SHE HOPES TO BE IN BEIJING IN THE 
MARATHON AND A FOURTH PLACE FOURTH 
LAST YEAR AS WELL I THINK 
LOOKS TIRED AT THIS STAGE WE WILL BE WATCHING THE CLOCK FOR 
LIZ YELLING AS WELL SHE WAS ON 
SCHEDULE TO RUN UNDER TWO AND A 
HALF HOURS SOMETHING AROUND 
PERHAPS THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MARK SALINA 
KOSGEI LOOKS VERY TIRED PETROVA IN 
THE TOP FIVE ONCE MORE SHE 
FINISHES IN FIFTH PLACE SHE WAS PAYING TRIBUTE TO HER 
HUSBAND WHO DIED IN A CRASH SAYING 
HE IS ALWAYS AT THE FRONT OF HER 
MIND NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD ONE OF 
THESE ATHLETES A BIT OF CRAMP 
THERE FOR PETROVA 
THE THIRD 
FINISHER IN THE WOMEN'S WHEELCHAIR 
RACE SHELLY WOODS SHE MUST HAVE 
HAD PROBLEMS TANNI TANNI 
SHE IS'S 
GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED ONE CAN 
ONLY ASSUME SHE'S HAD PROBLEMS WITH 
HER CHAIR 
BERHANE ADERE OF ETHIOPIA 
DISAPPOINTING IN THAT PERFORMANCE 
SOUAD AIT SALEM BEHIND HER THE 
ATHLETE WHO FELL OVER 
CONSTANTINA TOMESCU DITA THESE 
THREE BATTLING IT OUT THERE IS THE WELCOME FINISH LINE 
SOUAD AIT SALEM THEN BERHANE ADERE 
SHE IS LIMPING TOO THEN 
CONSTANTINA TOMESCU DITA AND NOW WE 
ARE WAITING CAN LIZ YELLING OF 
GREAT BRITAIN TAKE RUN HERSELF 
INTO SELECTION AND RUN HERSELF INTO 
THE TEAM FOREVER FOR BEIJING 
HERE COMES LIZ YELLING SHE'S 
CLEARLY ON FOR A PERBL BEST 
PERSONAL BEST SHE DESERVES IT HAS 
BEEN A GREAT STALWART FOR BRITISH 
DISTANCE RUNNING SHE COULD RUN 
WELL TOO IN BEIJING 
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE BY 
LIZ YELLING WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE 
UNDER PRESSURE FROM HAYLEY HAINING 
BEHIND LIZ YELLING LOOKING HER 
PLACE IN THE BRITISH OLYMPIC TEAM 
TAKING PERSONAL BEST AS WELL 
UNDER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE IT'S BEEN HARDER OUT 
THERE PERHAPS THAN SHE MIGHT HAVE 
THOUGHT BUT THE MARATHON IS ALWAYS 
A TOUGH CHALLENGE SHE ALREADY HAD 
THE OLYMPIC QUALIFYING TIME BUT 
SHE'S GONE QUICKER THIS TIME BUT 
MORE IMPORTANTLY THE FIRST BRITISH 
ATHLETE TO CROSS THE LINE SHE 
LOOKED BEHIND TO SEE WHERE HAYLEY 
HAINING IS SHE WASN'T TOO FAR 
BEHIND I THINK ABOUT FORTY FIVE SECONDS AT 
THE LAST COUNT 
I AM SURE SHE WILL GIVE HER A HUG 
WHEN SHE DOES CROSS THE LINE WELL 
DONE TO LIZ HUSBAND MARK WON'T 
KNOW IT YET HE IS STILL OUT ON THE 
COURSE RUNNING 
THAT'S GOOD TO SEE HAYLEY HAINING 
A PERSONAL BEST THAT WAS HER GAME 
PLAN SHE ALWAYS FELT I THINK 
THAT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS I CAN DO 
IF LIZ GOES FASTER THERE IS NOTHING 
I CAN DO ABOUT IT SHE 
CONGRATULATIONS TO HAYLEY HAINING 
WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE FROM HER AS 
FAR AS WE UNDERSTAND IT IT WILL BE 
PAULA RADCLIFFE MARA YAMAUCHI AND 
YELL REL LIZ YELLING WHO AT THIS 
POINT WILL GO TO BEIJING FITNESS 
ALLOWING I GUESS HAYLEY HAINING 
WILL BE ON STAND BY IF ANY OF THOSE 
FALTER BETWEEN NOW AND THEN THE MEN'S RACE IS FAST THEY WENT 
THROUGH NINETEEN MILES ALMOST AT WORLD 
RECORD PACE SUDDENLY AS IT WAS 
STRONG GROUP THEY STARTED TO KEEP 
AN EYE ON EACH OTHER THEY SLOWED 
DOWN THEN SUDDENLY MARTIN LEL 
LAST YEAR'S CHAMPION DECIDED TO 
SPEED IT UP SO LAST YEAR'S 
CHAMPION LEL SAMMY WANJIRU WHO 
HAS BROKEN THE WORD RECORD FOR THE 
HALF MARATHON THREE TIME AND 
BEHIND HIM MERGA OF ETHIOPIA GUMRI 
OF MOROCCO 
SO A VERY COMETIVE RACE AS WE SEE 
THEM THE OTHER ATHLETES HEADING 
OUT TOWARDS CANARY WHARF THEY HAVE 
JUST DONE OVER TWELVE MILES THE OTHER 
GUYS HAVE DONE OVER TWENTY TWO MILES 
SO LAST YEAR'S RUNNER UP MERGA OF 
ETHIOPIA HE TOLD US HE WOULD RUN 
VERY WELL HERE HE RAN THE SECOND 
FASTEST TIME IN THE MARATHON BUT 
HE IS CLEARLY WELL PREPED FOR THIS 
ONE GUMRI WAS SECOND BEHIND SAMMY 
WANJIRU IN NEW YORK LAST YEAR 
WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN TODAY AND 
SAMMY WANJIRU STILL THE NOVICE TWENTY ONE 
YEARS OF AGE MERGA STILL NOVICE 
LEL WITH ALL THE EXPERIENCE HE 
KNOWS HOW TO WIN IN LONDON GUMRI 
IS OUT FOR REVENGE AGAINST LEL HE 
DOES NOT LIKE GETTING KICKED OUT IN 
THE LATTER STAGES WHAT IS HIS 
TACTIC TODAY HAS HE ANYTHING 
DIFFERENT THIS TIME HAS SAMMY 
WANJIRU GOT PACE AND ONE OR TWO 
OTHER ATHLETES WE DON'T KNOW 
MERGA HAS REALLY GOOD FORM THEY 
HAVE HIGH HOPES FROM ETHIOPIA FOR 
HIM TODAY HE IS RUNNING GOOD 
RACE AT THIS POINT 
SOME OF THE OTHER NAMES FELIX LIMO 
AND RAMAALA THREE MINUTES ADRIFT 
IT WILL BE A QUICK RACE IN LONDON 
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE ARE HOPING TO GET YOU 
NEWS OF THE BRITISH ATHLETES TOMAS 
ABYU TRYING TO RUN UNDER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN DAN 
ROBINSON WITH PERHAPS A PLACE IN 
THE BAG 
AND MUTAI GETTING UP THERE WITH 
ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS OFF THE LEADERS 
STILL SOME RUNNING YET TO BE DONE 
THE FOUR MAY HAVE IT TO THEMSELVES 
BUT IF THIS WERE TO FALTER MUTAI 
AND HALL WOULD THERE QUICKLY 
LOOKING DOWN THE ROAD IS MUTAI OF 
KENYA KENYA IN THE LEADING GROUP SAMMY WANJIRU 
GUMRI AND LEL AND MERGA IF YOU 
LOOK AT THE FIRST TWO ATHLETES OF 
LAST YEAR AND THE FIRST TWO 
ATHLETES OF THE RECENT MARATHON SO 
THE CURRENT FORM AND RECENT FORM 
THE MARATHON NELSON MANDELA JAPAN 
IN DECEMBER WE HAVE FANTASTIC GUYS 
HERE THE FIRST TWO SAMMY WANJIRU 
AND MARTIN LEL THE TWO WINNERS OF 
THE RACES IN THE POSITION THAT THEY 
WERE AT THAT TIME SECOND AND 
FOURTH GUMRI AND MERGA WHO IS TO 
HAVE THE FINISH MARTIN LEL IS A 
VERY CONTROLLED ATHLETE HE KNOWS 
WHAT HE IS DOING IN THESE EVENTS 
THEN MUTAI 
AND FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE BY RYAN 
HALL OF THE UNITED STATES 
HE THEN WON THE AMERICAN TRIALS 
HAE HAS BEEN SELECTED FOR BEIJING 
HE IS RUNNING WELL AGAIN TODAY 
WE ARE LETTING THE TIMES GO THROUGH 
ON THE SCREEN YOU CAN WATCH THE 
NAMES POPPING UP MWAI KIBAKI 
SOKOLOV THERE TOO 
THERE IS STEFANO BALDINI AND DAN 
ROBINSON I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY 
WHERE ARE THE BRITISH ATHLETES DAN 
ROBINSON SIX MINUTES ADRIFT OF THE 
LEADERS HE MUST BE RUNNING CLOSE 
TO PERSONAL BEST FOR DAN ROBINSON 
AS FAR AS THE BRITISH TEAM IS 
CONCERNED DAN BECAUSE OF HIS 
EXCELLENT RUN IN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS LAST YEAR IS PRETTY 
MUCH ASSURED OF DECENT RUN TODAY 
HE HAS BALDINI IN HIS SIGHTS 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH DAN ROBINSON IS 
RUNNING WITH ANDREW LETHERBY OF 
AUSTRALIA AUSTRALIA ABYU IS RUNNING A HIGH RISK RACE 
TODAY HE HAS HAD BRONCHITIS IT 
MAY HAVE PUT PAID TO HIS CHANCES 
THERE IS FELIX LIMO OUTKICKED BY 
MARTIN LEL THE LAST TIME 
THEN FURTHER DOWN HERE WE ARE DAN 
ROBINSON APPROACHING THE TOP TEN 
PE IS HE IS IN THIRTEENTH PACE HE SETS 
OFF WITH A VERY GOOD PLAN IN MIND 
HE STICKS TO IT HE SAYS HE HAS 
BEEN IN GREAT SHAPE THE TRAINING 
HAS BEEN GOING EXCELLENT HE DOES 
NOT RACE THAT OFTEN BUT ON THE 
ROADS VERY MUCH IT IS HIS FORTE IN 
MARATHON RUNNING HE IS GETTING 
BETTER AND BETTER ALL THE TIME AT 
THE MOMENT HE IS HEADING FOR 
PERSONAL BEST AND AN ASSURESED 
BERTH IN THE OLYMPIC TEAM DAN HAS 
IGNORED THE BIG CITY RACES HE HAS 
RUN IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN ATHENS 
THE CAIMS IN EUROPE AND THE 
EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS THE 
COMMONWEALTH GAMES IN EUROPE 
TODAY IS HIS CHANCE AS HE LOOKS 
DOWN THE ROAD HE WILL SEE THE 
OLYMPIC CHAMPION STEFANO BALDINI 
AHEAD OF HIM HE REALLY REALLY 
DESERVES TO BE IN THAT POSITION A 
VERY VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE FOR DAN 
WE WONDER IF HE WILL RUN INSIDE HIS 
PERSONAL BEST HE IS LOOKING CLOSE 
TO IT 
LETHERBY AHEAD OF HIM THERE HE 
KNOWS HE IS ACCELERATING HIMSELF 
WHAT IS PRESENT SIGHT FOR DAN ROB 
INSON FOR MEN'S BRITISH RUNNING 
AND WHATEVER HE RUNS TODAY HE WILL 
BE IN BETTER SHAPE BY THE TIME HE 
COMES TO THE COMMONWEALTH GAMES 
WE WILL SEE THE LEADING GROUP THERE 
THE FOUR ATHLETES TOGETHER 
BATTLING IT OUT THERE IS DAN ROB 
INSON PULLING AWAY FROM NUMBER FIFTEEN 
ANDREW LETHERBY OF AUSTRALIA 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT FOR HIM IS 
FANTASTIC DAN HE WOULD NOT MIND 
ME SAYING IT HE HAS NOT BEEN 
CLASSIC ATHLETE BUT GETTING 
STRONGER AND STRONGER OVER THE 
YEARS LOOK HOW WELL HE IS MOVING 
LOOK AT THIS THIS IS AN HISTORIC 
SIGHT FOR DAN ROB INSON HE WILL 
LOOK AT THE VIDEO AS AN OLDER MAN 
LOOKING AT THIS RUNNING ALONG THE 
EMBANKMENT CATCHING STEFANO 
BALDINI THE MOST RESPECTED OF ALL 
MARATHON RUNNERS HE WILL ENJOY THE 
MOMENT AS HE GOES PAST HIM DAN ROB 
INSON IS RUNNING ALL TOGETHER 
FASTER AND STRONGER THAN THE 
OLYMPIC CHAMPION THERE HE GOES 
WELL DONE DAN ROB INSON 
TOMAS ABYU IS A COUPLE OF PLACES 
FURTHER BACK IN TERMS OF TIME DAN 
IS WELL WELL CLEAR GOOD MINUTE 
AND A HALF AHEAD OF TOMAS ABYU SO 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH TOMAS ABYU'S 
CHANCES OF GOING TO THE GAMES ARE 
DISAPPEARING IT IS NOT A QUICK 
ENOUGH TIME 
DAN IS REELING IN THE OLYMPIC 
CHAMPION THE NEXT ONE COULD BE THE 
WORLD CHAMPION 
IF HE KEEPS FORGING ON THE WAY THAT 
HE IS AND KIBET IS DRIFTING AS HE 
SEEMS TO BE IT COULD BE TWO 
FANTASTIC A 
TOP TEN FINISH WOULD BE EXCELLENT 
A PERSONAL BEST WOULD BE WONDERFUL 
INSON WILL BE MOST PLEASED IF HE 
KNOWS HE IS ON HIS WAY TO BEIJING 
HE IS AIMING TO BE IN BEIJING 
STEFANO BALDINI IS AIMING TO BE IN 
BEIJING HE IS RISE OLD 
CHARACTER HE PERFORMS WELL ON THE 
BEST OCCASIONS THE CONDITIONS IN 
BEIJING WILL BE COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT TO THIS 
COME ON DAN HE IS ONLY THE 
OLYMPIC CHAMPION WAS LOOKING AT 
HIS VEST EVERYBODY HAS HIS NAME ON 
DAN AS HE IS BRITISH HE HAS A 
UNION JACK ON HIS VEST HE HAS GOT 
DAN I DON'T THINK HE IS DESPERATE 
THE THING IS LOOK AT HIM HE HAS 
DONE THE HARD WORK HE HAS GONE UP 
TO THE OLYMPIC CHAMPION COME ON 
DAN RUN AWAY FROM HIM THERE IS THE VEST OF OUR TOP 
MARATHON RUNNER HE WAS SAYING THAT 
THEY WERE GETTING CRITICISED FOR 
NOT DOING THEIR BEST BUT IT IS THE 
CASE WITH DAN ROB INSON HE MAID 
NOT BE THE MOST TALENTED OF 
ATHLETES BUT HE WORKS HARD AT WHAT 
HE DOES HE PUTS IN THE HOURS HE 
PUTS IN THE WORK EVERY TIME HE 
RUNS MARATHON HE DOES 
EXCEPTIONALLY WELL 
THE TOP THREE 
SAMMY WANJIRU MARTIN LEL AND 
GOUMRI GOUMRI MARTIN LEL THE WINNER LAST YEAR 
AND TWO YEARS PRIOR 
GOUMRI KNOWS WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE 
KICKED OUT BY LEGG SAMMY WANJIRU 
THE NEW NAME OF DISTANCE RUNNING 
HIS COACH IS JAPAN IS A FORMER 
OLYMPIC SILVER MEDALLIST IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
HIS COACH DID NOT WANT HIM TO RUN 
THE RACE HE THINKS IT IS TOO MANY 
RACES IN A YOUNG CAREER 
IS HE LOOKING ANXIOUS IS LEL 
PLAYING THE WAITING GAME HERE ONCE 
AGAIN 
WELL THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH AGAIN TWENTY FOUR MILES IN ONE HOUR FIFTY FOUR AND THIRTY SEVEN 
SECONDS THAT IS TWENTY SECONDS FASTER 
THAN KHANNOUCHI'S RECORD 
A COURSE RECORD WILL BE A WONDERFUL 
PERFORMANCE IT WILL BE A RECORD 
IT IS CLEAR ABOUT THAT BOTH OF THE 
ATHLETES NO ONE LIKES TO BE ON THE 
RECEIVING END OF A SPRINT FROM 
MARTIN LEL GOUMRI LOST IN A SPRINT 
IN THIS EVENT LAST YEAR SAMMY 
WANJIRU LOST IN A SPRINT ALONG THE 
SEAFRONT IN SOUTH SHIELDS IN THE 
GREAT NORTH RUN 
HE HAS THE CONFIDENCE HAS HE THE 
ABILITY TODAY SAMMY WANJIRU IS 
GETTING BETTER IS SOMEBODY GOING 
TO MAKE A MOVE THEY BOTH KNOW 
GOUMRI AND SAMMY WANJIRU HOW QUICK 
MARTIN LEL CAN BE IF THEY LEAVE IT 
TO THE LAST COUPLE OF ZERO METRES 
HUNDRED METRES 
HAILE GEBRSELASSIE BROKE THROUGH 
THE RECORD IN ONE P. FIFTY EIGHT OH SEVEN THAT WORD 
RECORD PACE THEY WERE RUNNING AT 
AS YOU WERE SUGGESTING BY THE TIME 
THEY SEEM TO BE ON NOW HAS SLIPPED 
BY BUT WE ARE HEADING FOR VERY 
VERY QUICK RACE HERE FURTHER BACK 
DOWN THE FIELD DAN ROB INSON IS 
RUNNING ALONGSIDE THE OLYMPIC 
CHAMPION STEFANO BALDINI IN ELEVENTH 
AND ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWELFTH PLACES DAN IS RUNNING 
AN EXCELLENT RACE THE RACE AT THE 
FRONT IS FASCINATING ARE THEY 
WAITING FOR THE PRINT FINISH HERE 
WILL ANYBODY TRY TO PUT THEIR FOOT 
DOWN IN THE LAST MILE AND A HALF OR 
SO 
THERE WERE SO 
MANY NUMBERS SO SO MANY TALENTED ATHLETES WHEN THEY 
GOT TOT POINT TO RUN FASTER THEY 
WERE PHASED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE 
OTHERS OTHERS MARTIN LEL LAST YEAR'S CHAMPION 
THE NEW YORK MARATHON CHAMPION 
BEATING WANJIR U. IT SEEMS TO BE DRYING UP IT WAS A 
SEVERE STORM THERE NOW THE SUN IS 
OUT MARTIN LEL AND SAMMY WANJIRU 
THE TWO KENYAN ATHLETES WHATEVER 
ELSE THEY ARE GOING TO DO TODAY 
THEY WILL RUN THEMSELVES INTO THE 
KENYAN TEAM FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
IN BEIJING BUT THE WEATHER IN 
BEIJING WILL BE DIFFERENT TO THESE 
TODAY GOUMRI THE MARK IAN ATHLETE 
IS SETING IN THIRD PLACE SOMEBODY 
IS GOING TO MAKE A MOVE ABOVE THE 
THEM KNOW HOW QUICK MARTIN LEL IS 
OVER THE LAST TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED M. CAN THEY 
RUN THE FINISH OUT OF HIM MAYBE 
NOT NOT ING 
IT VERY INTERESTING ING INTERESTING VERY INTERESTING 
THEY MUST KNOW THAT SAMMY WANJIRU 
IS QUICK HE MAY HAVE THE ABILITY 
BUT GOUMRI HAS BEEN OUTKICKED 
BEFORE HE KNOWS WHAT HE HAS HAD 
HAPPEN TO HIM IN THE PAST BUT CAN 
HE OUTKICK HIM MARTIN LEL THAT 
REMAINS TO BE SEEN THE TIME IT IS 
HEADING CLOSE TO A COURSE RECORD 
IT IS WAS SET BY KHANNOUCHI SIX 
YEARS AGO THAT IS WITHIN THEIR 
SIGHTS THE WORLD RECORD IS GONE 
THEY MAY GET WITHIN FORTY FIVE SECONDS OR A 
MINUTE TO IT DEPENDING ON WHAT 
HAPPENS IN THE LATTER STAGES THIS 
IS A RACE ABOUT WINNING IT ABOUT 
WHO COMES FIRST LEL HEADING FOR A 
PERSONAL BEST WANJIRU HE IS IN 
PERSONAL BEST TERRITORY AS WELL 
AS IS GOUMRI HE HAS RUN TWO OH SEVEN ON 
FORTY FOUR GOUMRI MADE A LITTLE BIT OF AN 
EFFORT ON THE EMBANKMENT TRYING TO 
EDGE AWAY BUT THEY WERE NOT HAVING 
ANY OF IT NOW NECK AND NECK AS 
THEY HAVE BEEN BEFORE ARE THEY 
PULLING FEW YARDS OUT OF GOUMRI 
YOU WOULD NOT BET AGAINST MARTIN 
LEL IN A FINISH IF YOU WERE GOING 
TO BEAT MARTIN LEL YOU WOULD TRY TO 
RUN AWAY FROM HIM AT THIS POINT 
THE TIME IS QUICK IT WILL BE CLOSE 
TO KHANNOUCHI'S COURSE RECORD OF 
TWO HOURS FIVE MINUTES AND THIRTY EIGHT 
SECONDS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS 
THERE IS ONLY ONE MAN TO RUN UNDER 
TWO HOURS AND THIRTY SIX THAT IS HAILE 
GEBRSELASSIE GEBRSELASSIE SO THE LONDON MARATHON THE QUICK 
START IT IS ENSURING ONE OF THE 
FASTEST MARATHONS FOR MANY MANY 
YEARS YEARS NO ONE HAS RUN UNDER TWO HOURS AND 
SIX MINUTES 
MAYBE TWO OR THREE OF THESE COULD 
BE UNDER THAT TIME NOW THE TWO 
KENYANS IN THE POSITION THAT THEY 
FOUND THEMSELVES IN LAST YEAR 
THEY ARE NECK AND NECK COMING INTO 
THE FINISH LAST TIME IT WAS MARTIN 
LEL BUT WANJIRU KNOWS HOW QUICK HE 
IS CAN HE GO NOW OR IS LEL TOO 
POWERFUL AND TOO STRONG 
ON THE DAY 
THAT YOU SAID KHANNOUCHI RAN THAT 
QUICK TIME HE WAS IN A GREAT RACE 
WITH PAUL TERGAT AND HAILE 
GEBRSELASSIE HE THEN FOUND OUT 
WHAT THE MARATHON WAS ALL ABOUT AND 
RAN OUTSIDE OF TWO HOURS AND SIX 
MINUTES PERHAPS THREE MEN UNDER 
THAT TIME HERE ALL THREE ARE 
RUNNING FOR PERSONAL BEST WHO IS 
GOING TO WIN GOUMRI LOOKS AS 
THOUGH HE MAY HAVE TO SETTLE FOR 
THIRD SPOT 
RYAN HALL IS SET FOR A BIG PERSONAL 
BEST KHANNOUCHI HAS THAT AMERICAN 
RECORD BUT THIS WOULD BE THE 
PERHAPS WITH THE QUICKEST RUN BY AN 
AMERICAN BORN ATHLETE RYAN HALL IS 
IMPROVING WITH EVERY RACE HE IS 
GOING TO DO SO TODAY 
LEL AND WANJIRU LOCKED TOGETHER 
HERE WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU ARE 
WANJIRU YOU MAY HAVE THE 
EXUBERANCE OF YOUTH HE MAY THINK 
HE CAN OUTKICK MARTIN LEL HERE 
MARTIN LEL LOOKS AT HIS WATCH FOR 
NO APPARENT REASONS 
ALL IT WILL TELL IS THAT IT IS 
ABOUT ELEVEN FIFTY A M. THIS IS NOW ABOUT 
WHO IS TO BE THE MOST POWERFUL WE 
HAVE NEVER HAD A MARATHON WITH 
THREE RUNNING UNDER TWO OURS AND 
SIX MINUTES HERE THEY ARE NOW 
THE TWO CANNIANS BATTLING FOR THE

HUGE PERSONAL BEST IN SECOND PLACE 
INSIDE THE OLD COURSE RECORD 
GOUMRI TAKES THIRD SPOT WITH THREE 
MEN UNDER TWO HOURS AND SIX MINUTES 
THAT IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THAT'S 
BEEN ACHIEVED MARTIN LEL JUST IN 
SUPERB FORM THERE 
HE LOOKED COMFORTABLE ALL OF THE 
WAY WAY YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE LAST 
QUARTER OF A MILE IT IS AS THOUGH 
THE RACE JUST STARTS FOR MARTIN LEL 
HE HAS THE ABILITY TO FIND THE 
EXTRA PACE HERE IS A WONDERFUL 
BATTLE MUTAI OF KENYA CHASED DOWN 
BY RYAN HALL THEY ARE BOTH GOB TO 
BE REWARDED WITH VERY VERY QUICK 
TIMES INDEED 
RYAN HALL'S BEST IS TWO HOURS AND 
EIGHT MINUTES 
MUTAI AND THEN HALL 
AND STEFANO BALDINI THE OLYMPIC 
CHAMPION WHO WE LAST SAW RUNNING 
WITH DAN ROB INSON HE SAID THAT 
RYAN HALL WAS THE FUTURE OF 
MARATHON RUNNING A GOOD 
PERFORMANCE FROM MERGA 
HE WAS THERE FOR SO LONG HE WAS 
NOT ABLE TO GO WHEN THE BIG MOVE 
WAS MADE 
BUT SUPER SUPER QUICK TIMES THERE 
THE CLOCK HAS NOT GONE PAST TWO TWO 
HOURS AND SEVEN MINUTES WE HAVE 
HAD SIX MEN ACROSS THE LINE NOW 
SIX MEN ACROSS THE LINE AND SIX 
PERSONAL BESTS 
YOU CANNOT DO BETTER THAN THAT THE 
LONDON WEATHER MAY HAVE BEEN DAMP 
BUT PERFECT THE RACE SET UP HAS 
BEEN FANTASTICALLY WELL ORGANISED 
AND SET UP 
AND EXECUTED 
THERE IS DAN ROB INSON BATTLING IT 
OUT WITH STEFANO BALDINI 
THESE TWO THEY HAVE BEEN IN GOOD 
COMPANY TOGETHER L. WONDER CAN DAN 
ROB INSON HOLD HIM OFF THE FIN 
SIRB GOTTING UNDERWAY NOW THE FISH IRIS UNDER WAY NOW 
THE FINISH IS UNDER WAY NOW 
THE OLYMPIC SELECTION IS IN THE 
SIGHTS OF DAN ROBINSON 
A GLORIOUS SERIES OF PERFORMANCES 
IN THE MEN'S RACE 
THERE ARE THE PEDDLES ON THE MALL 
THERE KIFLE A LITTLE OUTSIDE OF 
HIS PERSONAL BEST BUT HE TOOK THE 
RISK OF GOING WITH THE BLISTERING 
PACE SET EARLY ON IN THE MEN'S PACE 
THEY WERE WORKING ON A WORLD RECORD 
PACE PACE THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF CAGINESS 
TO INTRODUCE NONETHELESS REWARDED 
WITH A NEW COURSE RECORD AND WITHIN 
ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS OF THE WORLD 
RECORD IN THE END THE NEXT THING 
FOR US TO WATCH OUT FOR IS DAN 
ROBINSON RUNNING WITH THE OLYMPIC 
CHAMPION HE IS ENTERING PARLIAMENT 
SQUARE THERE IS LESS THAN A MILE 
TO GO FOR DAN ROBINSON THERE HE 
ISS THE CHEERS FOR STEFANO BALDINI 
STRIDE BY STRIDE ALONG WITH STEFANO 
BALDINI HE HAS RALLIED A LITTLE IN 
THE LATER STAGES HE IS ALWAYS VERY 
STRONG THE ITALIAN 
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE GONE 
QUICKER HE LIKES TO RUN IN LONDON 
IT IS PART OF HIS PREPARATION 
LEADING INTO THE OLYMPIC GAMES HE 
IS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE TYPE OF 
CONDITIONS THEY ARE GOING TO FACE 
GOING TO FACE THERE 
I WAS SPEAKING TO DAN HE WAS 
SAYING HE WOULD NOT GO OUT TOO 
QUICKLY BEFORE HE PREPARES SO WELL 
DOESN'T HE 
HE DOES 
THE OFFICIALS ARE JUMPING UP AND 
DOWN AS THEY SEE THE UNION JACK 
VEST DAN ROBINSON BEHIND THE 
OLYMPIC CHAMPION LIAM CAMPBELL 
FELIX LIMO HAS NOT HAD A GOOD RACE 
TODAY TODAY HE IS THE ONLY MAN TO SURPRISE 
THERE IS A THIRD VICTORY FOR MARTIN 
LEL LEL FELIX LIMO TWO HOURS AND TEN AND A 
HALF MINUTES HE WILL NOT BE 
SELECTED FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES FOR 
KENYA BUT YOU HAVE TO BE PRETTY 
GOOD TO MAKE THEIR TEAM 
NOT SUCH A GOOD DAY FOR FELIX LIMO 
RAMAALA PUTTING IN A GOOD PACE HE 
WILL NOT WANT TO GIVE THIS UP TOO 
EASILY THERE IS NOT MUCH HE CAN DO 
ABOUT IT THE FORM ERWINER IN NEW 
YORK YORK HE LOOKS AS THOUGH HE IS GOING 
THROUGH THE MOTIONS 
HE IS REDOUBTABLE COMPETITOR 
AM SURE HE WILL BE IN BEIJING 
PRETTY SURE HE WILL BE ANY WAY 
BUT FINDING SOKOLOV A LITTLE TOO 
PACEY IN THE LATTER STAGES HE IS 
DOING WELL SOKOLOV IN THE GROUP 
WITH BALDINI AND ROBINSON HE MOVES 
INTO THE TOP TEN HERE 
I THINK THAT MAKE IT IS NINTH AND 
TENTH I WILL CHECK L. THINK THAT 
KIFLE WAS SEVENTH WE KNOW THAT DAN 
ROBINSON IS NOT TOO FAR AWAY WE 
KNOW HE WOULD HAVE HOPED TO BE IN 
THE TOP ELEVEN THERE HE IS THEY 
HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED METRES TO GO DAN 
IF HE CAN KEEP FORGING OVER THE 
LAST FOUR HUNDRED M. OR SO HE WILL BE HEADING 
FOR A PERSONAL BEST 
DAN WORKING HARD 
WITH THE LAST FOUR ZERO METRES HE IS 
RUNNING STRONGLY NOW 
HE IS TO BE CLEARLY INSIDE TWO HOURS 
AND THIRTEEN MINUTES C. H. THERE IS THE 
WORD CHAMPION MWAI KIBAKI OF 
KENYA KENYA LUKE KIBET 
HE WILL NOT FINISH TO BE IN THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES IT SHOWS YOU HOW HARD 
YOU HAVE TO WORK TO BE IN THEIR 
TEAM TEAM AND THERE IS THE OLYMPIC CHAMPION 
LET'S FACE IT IS LET'S FACE IT 
IF DAN CAN KEEP UP TO HIM HE IS 
WELL ON THE WAY TO AN OUTSTANDING 
PERSONAL BEST TWO HOURS AND THIRTEEN 
MINUTES HE IS WELL INSIDE OF HIS 
BEST THAT IS TWO HOURS TWO HOURS 
THIRTEEN MINUTES AND FIFTY THREE SECONDS 
WELL DONE WELL DONE DAN 
ROBINSON ROBINSON TWELFTH PLACE WE MAKE THAT A LITTLE 
PAT ON THE BACK FOR THE OLYMPIC 
CHAMPION WELL DONE FOR GETTING 
THINGS RIGHT ON THE BIG DAY FOR HIM 
THIS WAS REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE 
HE WAS IN THE TEAM FOR BEIJING HE 
HAD THE STANDARD BECAUSE OF HIS 
PERFORMANCE IN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND FINISHING IS FIRST 
BUT HE HAS DONE A PERSONAL BEST 
TODAY LETHERBY OF AUSTRALIA 
CROSSING THE LINE BEHIND THEM 
A LITTLE FURTHER BACK A COUPLE OF 
MINUTES BACK TOMAS ABYU MAY WELL BE 
THE NEXT BRITISH FINISHER HE WAS A 
MINUTE AND A HALF BEHIND THESE TWO 
ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE MILES BACK HIS 
PREPARATIONS HAD NOT GONE SO WELL 
BUT ONCE MORE WE HAVE BEEN 
REWARDED WITH ESPECIALLY IN THE 
MEN'S RACE SUPERB RACE THREE 
MEN UNDER TWO HOURS AND SIX MINUTES 
THAT WAS PHENOMENAL RUNNING IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE MAY 
HAVE PREDICTED THAT THEY WOULD GO 
QUITE THAT FAST WE GET USED TO THE 
TACTICAL RACES IN THE LATER YEARS 
THE LAST FEW HAVE NOT BEEN AS QUICK 
AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST BUT 
TODAY NEW COURSE RECORD NOT THAT 
FAR OFF THE WORLD RECORD 
THIS LOOKS LIKE DIANA KASYAR HE IS 
RUNNING FOR CANADA 
DANNY KASYAR TOMAS ABYU WAS A COUPLE OF PLACES 
BEHIND HIM THE LAST WE HEARD THE 
GAP IS PRETTY BIG AT THIS STAGE OF 
THE RACE 
APART FROM DAN ROBINSON YOU WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE A FEW MORE BRITISH 
ATHLETES IN THE TWO HOURS AND THIRTEEN

HE HAS RUN TWO HOURS AND TEN 
MINUTES MINUTES HE CAN DO BETTER THOMAS CAN RUN BETTER THAN THIS HE 
DID IN DUBLIN LATE LAST YEAR

REALLY WAIT AND BIDE HIS TIME AND 
GET IN THE RIGHT RACE DUBLIN LET 
HIM DOWN THERE WE ARE OVERLOOKING

BRILLIANTLY ORGANISED MARATHON

THE QUALITY OF THE ATHLETES AS WELL

MY TWO KIDS THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO 
SPONSORED ME 
THIS IS YOUR FIRST 
MARATHON WHAT IS THE OCCASION 
LIKE 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE HONESTLY LIKE FROM BARS TO PEOPLE COMING OUT OF 
THEIR HOUSES TO LITTLE KIDS 
SLAPPING MY HANDS ROY IS RUNNING 
WITH ME ALLY HAVE YOU GIVEN BIRTH 
YET 
ALLY KEEP GOING YET A RUGBY PITCH LONDON STREETS 
WHICH IS HARDER 
ONLY TWENTY SIX MILES IS 
THIS A PIECE OF CAKE 
THE OFFICIAL CHARITY OF THIS YEAR'S 
LONDON MARATHON IS THE SPINAL 
INJURIES ASSOCIATION WE ARE NOW 
GOING TO TRY AND TELL A STORY OF 
TWO FRIENDS DAVID MARTIN AND GLYN 
COUPLAND GLYN IS RUNNING TODAY FOR 
THE CHARITY AFTER DAVID HAD 
SERIOUS CAR ACCIDENT IN SOUTH 
AFRICA AT THE END OF LAST YEAR 
THAT LEFT HIM PARALYSED AND HE IS 
NOW RECUPERATING AT THE WORLD 
FAMOUS STOKE MANDEVILLE HOSPITAL 
I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A CHALLENGE OF 
SOME KIND L. SAILED FROM THE CANARY 
ISLANDS TO THE CARIBBEAN I HAVE 
DONE SEVEN MARATHONS OVER SEVEN 
DAYS NOW I'VE GOT A BIG CHALLENGE 
OF GETTING MY LIFE BACK 
NORMAL AS I CAN 
I FIRST MET DAVID AT READING ROWING 
CLUB IT WAS AT B. B. Q. AT MY HOUSE 
HE TOLD ME OF PLANS TO ROW ACROSS 
THE ATLANTIC MY REACTION TO THAT 
WAS THE SAME AS MOST PEOPLE'S YOU 
ARE BIT NUTS AFTER THINKING 
ABOUT IT FOR A SHORT WHILE I 
THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO DO THAT I I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING OF THE 
ACCIDENT APART FROM THE CAR 
TURNING OVER L. L. WAS 
IN THE HOSPITAL IN CAPE TOWN I THINK THAT IS 
PROBABLY WHEN IT DAWNED ON ME THAT 
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY FAIRLY SERIOUS L. 
REAL ISLE WHAT HAD HAD HAPPENED 
AND I JUST THOUGHT THAT IS IT 
THAT'S WHAT HAS HAPPENED L. HAVE TO 
START AGAIN 
I WAS AT A LOSS AS TO WHAT TO DO 
FOR DAVID L. DECIDED TO LOOK UP A 
RELEVANT CHARITY FOUND THE S. I. A. 
I SAW THE EXCELLENT WORK THEY WERE 
DOING I DECIDED TO APPROACH THEM 
AND RUN FOR THEM L. KNEW THAT AT 
SOME POINT DAVID WOULD BE 
INTERESTED TO GET BACK INTO SPORT 
IT'S BEEN A LARGE PART OF HIS LIFE 
L. KNOW IT WILL BE AGAIN REBUILDING 
LIFE THROUGH SPORT IS FUNDED 
ENTIRELY THROUGH PEOPLE WHO ARE 
RUNNING THE MARATHON FOR THE SPINAL 
INJURIES ASSOCIATION IT IS SOME 
SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT'S GOING 
FUND THEIR WORK FOR THE NEXT THREE 
YEARS OR SO 
REHABILITATION HERE IS QUITE TOUGH 
IT SEEMS LIKE A PLEASANT THING TO 
DO TO GO SWIMMING IN A POOL BUT 
FOR THE FIRST FEW SESSIONS I JUST 
FELT PANIC I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO 
ROWING THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT DID TROUBLE ME TO START WITH 
THAT I WOULD BE FRIGHTENED OF THE 
WATER HAND BIKING IS A SPORT THAT 
I COULD GET INTO FAIRLY QUICKLY 
BECAUSE GLYN IS DOING THE LONDON 
MARATHON FOR THE S. I. A. THIS YEAR IT 
WOULD BE NICE IF THE FOUR OF US 
FROM THE CREW DID IT NEXT YEAR 
UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T INCLUDE 
HAND BIKES IN THE LONDON MARATHON 
I THINK WE ARE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO 
GO TO NEW YORK AND DO THE NEW YORK 
MARATHON MARATHON RUNNING WITHOUT DAVID IS ACTUALLY 
QUITE DIFFICULT THAT WAS WHERE WE 
WOULD GO OUT AND HAVE GOOD LONG 
CHAT OVER TEN MILES OR SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT IT'S QUITE PAINFUL 
THINKING THAT I CAN GO ON THIS RUN 
AND DAVID CAN'T WHEN I'M RUNNING 
THE MARATHON I'LL BE DOING IT WITH 
HIM IN MIND SO I KNOW HE WOULD 
ENJOY THE AGONY WITH ME IF HE 
COULD COULD THE FIRST AMBITION IS TO GET HOME 
AND GET OUT OF THE HOSPITAL PEOPLE 
HAVE SAID THAT IT'S JUST ANOTHER 
CHALLENGE TO GET OVER TO A LARGE 
EXTENT I SEE IT LIKE THAT L. WANT 
TO GET BACK TO AS NEAR NORMAL AS I 
CAN AS SOON AS I CAN 
SOMETHING I HAVE TO GET THROUGH AND 
IT'S A CHAEM 
THERE CERTAINLY ARE SOME AMAZING 
STORIES OUT THERE NOT JUST THE ONE 
THAT WE HAVE JUST HEARD ABOUT BUT 
MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE 
GOT THEIR OWN PERSONAL REASONS FOR 
RUNG THE MARATHON HERE TODAY 
THEY'RE ALL FANTASTIC 
WE SAW THE FIRST FINISHES IN THE 
MALL EARLIER ON TODAY I MENTIONED THE DRAMATIC FINISH 
THERE WAS A BIG BIG CRASH IT WAS 
DAVID WEIR WHO SPRINTED AWAY IN THE 
END OVER THE LAST FOUR HUNDRED M. 
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE EXPERTS 
WHO IS YOUR MONEY ON 
EVEN RIGHT 
NOW IT'S HARD DAVE WEIR HAS 
STARTED HIS KICK HE'S VERY VERY 
STRONG HE'S TIMED IT WELL HE 
KICKED JUST COMING OUT OF THE BEND 
WHICH WILL MAKE IT REALLY TOUGH FOR 
EVERYONE ELSE TO FOLLOW YOU KNOW 
OH MY GOODNESS 
THERE'S BEEN A 
CRASH DAVID WEIR WINS IT KIRK 
FERNLY OF AUSTRALIA IN SECOND PLACE 
ONE POINT THREE THREE THAT IS OUTSIDE OF HIS COURSE 
RECORD DAVID CONGRATULATIONS MY 
WORD WHAT A FINISH 
YEAH PROBABLY 
THE TOUGHEST RACE I HAVE EVER DONE 
IN LONDON 
YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT 
WITH THE INCREASED PRIZE MONEY IT 
ATTRACTED A GREAT FIELD 
YES IT'S 
PROBABLY THE BEST FIELD AT THE 
MOMENT I'M PROBABLY NOT EVEN THE 
TOP TENS IN THE MARATHONS AT THE 
MOMENT BUT LONDON SUITS ME IT'S 
AN UP AND DOWN COURSE THE OTHER 
GUYS LIKE TO GO OUT FAST AND STAY 
FAST WHERE LONDON IS A BIT TIGHTER 
AND TWISTY IT SUITS ME 
YOU ARE 
GETTING A TREMENDOUS REPUTATION AS 
A SPRINT FINISHER 
IT SUITS ME TO 
FINISH LIKE THAT BECAUSE OF MY 
SPRINTING BACKGROUND I'M ALWAYS 
GLAD I'M THERE AT THE FINISH 
BECAUSE I HAVE A GOOD BURST OF 
SPEED 
HOW DID YOU FEEL GOING INTO SPEED THIS RACIAL BECAUSE HAVE YOU BEEN 
ILL 
LAST YEAR I HAD GLANDULAR ILL FEVER UP TO CHRISTMAS L. DIDN'T 
START BUILDING UP FOR LONDON 
MARATHON UNTIL FEBRUARY L. WENT TO 
PORTUGAL AND DID THE LISBON HALF 
MARATHON I WAS EIGHT SECONDS 
OUTSIDE THE WORLD RECORD L. WAS IN 
GOOD SHAPE L. CAME BACK AND CAUGHT 
A COLD AND A COUGH L. HAD AN 
INFECTION I DIDN'T HAVE THE 
GREATEST BUILD UP TO LONDON 
MARATHON I WAS IN CATCH UP MODE 
THIS WEEK IT'S A DESERVING WIN I I WONDER WHAT YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU'RE 
FIT THEN WELL 
WHAT ABOUT THE WELL PRIMPS I KNOW YOU WANT THE GOLD 
MEDALLIST 
I HAVE NOT DECIDED WHAT MEDALLIST DISTANCE I WILL DO YET L. L. WILL 
PROBABLY MAKE THAT DECISION NEARER 
THE TIME SEE HOW FIT AND HEALTHY I 
AM AND SEE THE POLLUTION LEVEL TO
