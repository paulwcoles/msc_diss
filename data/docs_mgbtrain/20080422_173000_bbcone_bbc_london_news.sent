THE LEADERS OF MAIN POLITICAL 
PARTIES ATTENDED THE SERVICE TODAY

PLANS TO CHANGE FLIGHT PATHS NORTH 
OF LONDON THE NATIONAL AIR TRAFFIC 
SERVICE SAYS THE CHANGES ARE NEEDED

DISTURBANCE FOR ANOTHER SEVEN THOUSAND 
PEOPLE THE CHANCELLOR'S FOUR PENCE

NAIL IN THE COFFIN FOR MANY OF THE 
CAPITALS PUBS ACCORDING TO 
CAMPAIGNERS THE BRITISH BEER AND

WITH THE SMOKING BAN AND CURRENT 
CREDIT CRUNCH ARE ALL TAKING THEIR 
TOLL LAST YEAR FIFTY FOUR PUBS CALLED TIME 
AND BREWERS ARE GOING INTO 
LIQUIDATION WELL PARIAC O'BRIEN IS 
AT A PUB IN CENTRAL LONDON NOW 
WELL HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS 
A CRISIS IN THE PUB INDUSTRY AT 
THIS PACKED PUB TODAY BUT ONE PUB 
INDUSTRY INSIDER SAID THAT IT IS 
LIKE THE PERFECT STORM WHEN IT 
COPS TO THE MACRO ECONOMICS 
SURROUNDING A CRUMBLING PUB 
INDUSTRY I WENT AROUND TO THE 
LANDMARK PUBS AROUND THE CAPITAL 
THAT HAVE CLOSED IN THE LAST TWO 
YEARS IT IS MY BOS'S IDEA OF A 
SICK JOKE HE SENT ME ON LONDON'S 
DRYEST PUB CRAWL STARTING HOOR AT 
THE INTED TIP FOX FAMOUS THINK SEX 
PISTOL'S LOCAL NOW THE CAMDEN 
FALCON FEATURED IN A HITCHCOCK 
FILM LAST UP IS THE TORRIAN IT IS 
NOT BOARDED UP YET BUT 
DEVELOPERS WANT TO TURN IT INT 
FLATS IT PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING A 
FAMILY FRIENDLY LOCAL BUT COULD GO 
THE WAY OF THE FIFTY FOUR OTHER PUBS THAT 
HAVE CLOSED INST THE LAST SIX 
MONTHS BUT NOT IF THIS WOMAN HAS 
HER WAY 
THESE SIGNATURES SPEAK 
VOLUMES YOU CAN'T CLOSE THIS 
PLACE THE BEST HOST IN TOWN THE 
BEST STAFF JUST THE BEST PUB HOW 
CAN THEY CLOSE THE PUB WELL WELL BECAUSE THE BOTTOM IS FALLING OUT 
OF THE PUB BUSINESS WE GT A MARKET 
ANALYST AND A REAL ALE CAMPAIGNER 
TOGETHER TO DISCUSS 
IT DOES LOOK 
AS IF ALL THE COST PRESSURES ARE 
AGAINST THE PUBS EVERYTHING IS 
AGAINST THEM 
YES THERE IS A LOT 
OF COST PRESSURES THERE IS 
INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF HOPS AND 
BARLEY AND THE TAX RISE 
IT IS A 
QUESTION OF SALES AND COSTS SALES 
ARE UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE OF THE 
SMOKING BAN AND THE DRINK DRIVING 
LAWS PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO PUBS 
AS MUCH THEY ARE DRINKING LESS 
WHEN THEY DO IF YOU GET LOWER 
TURNOVER AND YOU COSTS KEEP GOING 
UP PUBS WILL BE UNDER PRESSURE YOU 
SO LONDON'S INTE PID FOXES WILL 
CONTINUE TO BECOME THE LOCK AND KEY 
THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT MORE DAYS OF 
CAMPAIGN BEFORE LONDON ELECTS A NEW 
MAYOR WE HAVE BEEN WORK THE VIDEO 
SHARING WEB SITE YOUTUBE TO PUT 
YOUR QUESTIONS TO THE CANDIDATES 
VIEW TODAY WE PUT THE 
QUESTIONS TO THE LABOUR'S KEN 
LIVINGSTONE 
I LIVE IN WEST LONDON LIVINGSTONE I HAVE A QUESTION FOR KEN 
REGARDING THE CONGESTION CHARGE 
YOU ARE TRYING TO DRIVE LONDONERS 
OUT WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS 
IT IS 
SIMPLE IF YOU HAVE GOT A CITY AS 
CONGESTED AS LONDON THEN YOU NEED 
TO HAVE A DEGREE OFRATIONING ROAD 
SPACE BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE BUILT 
A NEW ROAD IT FILLS UP AND YOU CAN 
CARRY ON UNTIL YOU WOULD BE LIKE 
LOS ANGELES GIVEN WE ARE MOVING 
INTO A CLIMATE CHANGE REPRESENTS 
PROBLEMS FOR HUMANITY WE HAVE TO 
REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS THESE 
POLICIES INITIAL THINK CONGESTION 
CHARGE WAS DRIVEN TO REDUCE 
CONGESTION IN LONDON AT THE MOMENT 
IT CAME IN SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE LESS 
DROVE N. BUSES IMPROVED ACCIDENTS 
WENT DOWN AND WE FOUND THAT OXIDES 
WHICH ARE THE THINGS THAT TRIGGER 
CANCER AND ASTHMA WERE DOWN AND 
CARBON WAS DOWN 
WHY IS TRAVEL SO 
EXPENSIVE I WANT IT CHEAPER TWO ON 
THE BUS IT ISRY DIB LOUSE SEVEN IN 
THE MORNING TO GET SOMEWHERE ON THE 
TRAIN HOW MUCH ARE YOU RAKING IN 
I DON'T CONTROL THE TRAINS THE 
ONLY TRAINS I CONTROL WHICH HAS 
BEEN SINCE NOVICE THE NORTH LONDON 
LINE THERE WE HAVE BROUGHT THE 
FARES DOWN IN LINE WITH THE OYSTER 
CARD SYSTEM WHAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO 
HAVE AN OYSTER CAR ONLY ONE PERSON 
IN A HUNDRED PAYS CASH ON THE BUS 
AND ON THE TUBE SO THE BUS FARE IS 
NINETY PENCE EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN I 
BECAME MAYOR IT WAS A POUND IN 
CENTRAL LONDON AND SEVENTY PENCE OUTSIDE 
SO IT IS OVER TWENTY PER CENT INFLATION SO THEY 
HAVE BEEN CUT 
WHAT CAN YOU DO 
ABOUT THE GUN CRIMES IN LONDON 
WELL CRIME'S BEEN OUR BIG SUCCESS 
STORY BECAUSE WE HAD A FORTY YEAR 
INCREASE IN CRIME IT WENT UP AND 
DOWN OCCASIONALLY BUT IT'S JUST 
GENERALLY AND UNREMITTING INCREASE 
CRIME TREBLED DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AS 
WE WENT TO BEING SOCIETY OF MASS 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND CREATION OF AN 
UNDERCLASS IT PEAKED IN BRITAIN IN 
NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND PEAKED IN LONDON IN TWO THOUSAND THREE 
SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE CRIME'S BEEN CUT BY OVER 
TWENTY PER CENT MURDERS DOWN BY TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT RAPE BY 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
THAT'S ON PAPER CRIMES GOING TWENTY FIVE PER CENT DOWN THEN AGAIN IT FEELS A LOT OF 
PEOPLE SAY THIS OVER THE LAST YEAR 
AND A HALF YOU ARE CONSTANTLY 
HEARING ABOUT KIDS BEING STABBED 
AND SHOT T. NEVER USED TO BE LIKE 
THIS DID IT REALLY 
WELL THE 
CRIME THE CRIME STATISTICS I AM 
TALKING ABOUT THE ONES WE HAD FOR 
ONE HUNDRED YEARS THE CRIMES THAT GET 
REPORTED IF ANYTHING MORE CRIME IS 
BEING REPORTED BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE 
POLICE ON THE STREETS WHAT YOU 
HAVE AS CRIME GOES DOWN THERE 
SEEMS TO BE MORE INTENSE REPORTING 
OF THE CRIME THAT REMAINS AND IF 
YOU ACTUALLY ANALYSE PEOPLE'S FEAR 
OF CRIME IT'S ACTUALLY DOWN BUT 
IT'S VERY MUCH INFLUENCED BY WHICH 
PAPER YOU READ PEOPLE WHO READ 
PAPERS THAT GO VERY HEAVILY ON 
CRIME THAT LINE IF IT BLEEDS IT 
LEADS YOU GET ON THE T. V. STUDIOS 
ARE MORE IN FEAR OF CRIME BECAUSE 
THEY THINK IT'S WORSE THAN IT IS 
DO ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY CUNNING PLAN 
TO INTRODUCE AIR CONDITIONING ON 
THE UNDERGROUND 
WE ARE TAKING THE 
GROUND WATER FROM BELOW LONDON 
WHICH IS ONLY JUST ABOVE FREEZING 
LEVEL AND WE ARE CIRCULATING IT 
THROUGH PIPES UNDER PLATFORMS AND 
UNDER THE TRACK AT PLATFORMS 
BECAUSE MOST OF THE HEAT GENERATED 
ON THE UNDERGROUND IS FROM THE 
BREAKING PROCESS SO THAT COLD WATER 
WILL WARM UP THE HEAT WILL BE 
TAKEN AWAY TO BE USED POSITIVELY 
ELSEWHERE SO GRADUALLY AS THIS 
COMES IN THE TEMPERATURES WILL 
START TO GO DOWN 
WHEN IS THAT 
GOING TO HAPPEN EVEN TODAY MIDDLE 
OF APRIL I FOUND MYSELF ON THE 
NORTHERN LINE BAKING HOT 
THE NEW 
TRAINS START COMING OVER AT THE END 
OF THIS YEAR THAT'S ALL THE 
SUBSERVICE LINES WE HAVE DONE THE 
WORK AT VICTORIA STATION ON THIS 
COOLING SYSTEM WE THINK IT WORKS 
WE ARE NOW GOING TO START 
REPLICATING THAT ACROSS THE SYSTEM 
WHAT IS CERTAINLY BEING ASKED BY 
ALL OF THE MUSLIMS IN LONDON IS 
WHAT IS THE FUTURE MAYOR OF LONDON 
GOING TO DO TO COMBAT VICTIMISATION 
OF MUSLIMS AND HELP HOW ARE THEY 
GOING TO TACKLE ISLAMOPHOBIA ISLAM ISLAM IS NO MORE OR LESS VIOLENT THAN ANY 
OTHER RELIGION WHEN LONDON ATTACK 
WAS ATTACKED IN JULY TWO THOUSAND FIVE THIS 
WASN'T A RELIGIOUS ATTACK IT 
WASN'T IDEA LOGICAL IT WAS A ACT 
OF MURDER 
WHAT WILL THEY BE DOING 
TO SUPPORT WOMEN WHO ARE FACING 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND DO NOT HAVE 
NO RECOURSE TO THE PUBLIC FUNDS 
POLICE WERE FORCED TO TAKE DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE SERIOUSLY THE RESULT HAS 
BEEN A REAL DECLINE IN MURDER THE 
BIGGEST PART OF OUR REDUCTION IN 
MURDER IN LONDON HAS COME FROM 
DOMESTIC MURDERS BECAUSE WHAT THE 
POLICE RECOGNISE IS THE MAN THAT 
SMACKS HIS WIFE IN THE MOUTH IS 
VERY LIKELY A POTENTIAL MURDERER 
AND THAT ANGER CAN BUILD AND BY 
ACTUALLY MOVING IN AND PROSECUTING 
AND TAKING ACTION WE HAVE SEEN 
DRAMATIC FALL IN THE NUMBERS OF 
WOMEN BEING MURDERED 
MY QUESTION 
IS COULD YOU GET US MORE SUNSHINE 
IT'S CHANGING IN TWENTY YEARS' TIME 
THE AMOUNT OF RAIN WILL HAVE HALVED 
WE ARE HEADING TOWARDS A CLIMATE 
MORE MEDITERRANEAN 
YOU CAN WATCH 
KHREUFBG ANSWERING MORE OF YOUR 
QUESTIONS ON OUR WEBSITE AND ON 
YOUTUBE FROM TOMORROW 
HERE IS A LIST OF ALL THE 
CANDIDATES STANDING IN THE MAYORAL 
ELECTION 
OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS IT'S 
ESTIMATED AROUND FORTY THOUSAND TREES MAY 
HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN UNNECESSARILY IN 
LONDON IT'S ALL TO DO WITH 
INSURANCE CLAIMS RELATING TO THE 
SUBSIDENCE A NEW SYSTEM OF VALUING 
INDIVIDUAL TREES HAS BEEN CREATED 
TO HELP SAVE MORE OF THEM THE MOST 
TREASURED SO FAR IS IN MAYFAIR 
WHERE WE CAN JOIN MARK ASHDOWN 
THIS IS IT THIS IS THE LONDON 
PLANE IN QUESTION IT'S SIX F. T. WIDE 
WHAT AN IMPRESSIVE SPESMAN IT IS 
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS OLD LONDON'S MOST 
VALUABLE THREE AT THREE MOST 
VALUABLE TREE IF THIS FELL NOBODY 
GETS A PENNY THIS IS ABOUT TRYING 
TO DEFER INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM 
TRYING TO CHOP IT DOWN BECAUSE AT 
THE MOMENT IF A HOUSE AROUND HERE 
HAD A SUBSIDENCE PROBLEM THE 
COMPANIES WOULD LOOK FOR THE 
PROBLEM PROBABLY PUT IT IN THE LAP 
OF THE TREE ASK A LOCAL COUNCIL 
CAN WE CHOP IT DOWN THEY USUALLY 
SAY YES AND THERE WE GO AS YOU SAY 
FORTY THOUSAND IN FIVE YEARS IS HIGH TOO 
HIGH SAY TREE EXPERTS MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF TREES HAVE BEEN 
REMOVED WHERE THEY WEREN'T THE MAIN 
CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM AND ONE OF 
THE NONSENSES OF THAT IS THAT THEN 
THE CAUSE OF THE BUILDING DAMAGE 
STILL REMAINS SO THE TREE'S BEEN 
FELLED THE BUILDING STILL 
CONTINUES TO MOVE AND THAT ASSET TO 
THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LOST YOU YOU CAN SEE FROM BACK HERE WHAT AN 
ASSET IT IS THERE ARE MANY LIKE 
THIS ACROSS LONDON AND AND THEY'LL 
ALL HOPEFULLY BE GIVEN A VALUATION 
BASED ON THE AGE OF THE TREE ITS 
HEALTH AND ON AN EVENING LIKE THIS 
HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE NEARBY AND 
WANT TO SIT DOWNNEATH IT FOR 
EXAMPLE THE RANGES WILL BE BETWEEN 
A COUPLE OF THOUSAND AND THIS IS 
IT'S TOP END OF THE SCALE THE IDEA 
BEING IT WILL DETER INSURANCE 
COMPANIES ASKING TO CHOP THEM DOWN 
AND COUNCILS FROM GETTING OUT THE 
CHAIN SAWS 
IT'S THE ENCOUNTERNO CHELSEA 
SUPPORTER REALLY WANTED PLAYING 
LIVER LIVERPOOL FOR A CHANCE IN THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL CAN THEY 
MAKE IT THIRD TIME LUCKY HAVING 
LOST TO THE REDS ON PREVIOUS 
OCCASIONS OCCASIONS ON RECENT YEARS THESE GATES HAVE 
BARRED CHELSEA'S PROGRESSION TO TWO 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINALS THE CLUB'S 
BILLIONAIRE OWNER DOESN'T LIKE LIKE 
EUROPEAN FAIL EURO SO MUCH SO YOU 
MAY REMEMBER LAST SEPTEMBER 
FOLLOWING THIS GAME THE SPECIAL ONE 
JOSE MOURINHO GOT THE SACK WILL 
THE SAME FATE BEFALL AVRAM GRANT L. 
HAVE CLIVE WALKER HERE IS AVRAM 
GRANT FOR THE CHOP IF THEY LOSE I I DON'T THINK SO THERE IS THE THE 
SECOND LEG CHELSEA CAN'T AFFORD TO 
LOSE THE TIE HERE IT'S A BIG GAME 
FOR ONE THEY'VE TO STAY IN TOUCH 
WITH LIVERPOOL AND NOT LOSE GROUND 
TOO MUCH THREE TO ZERO AND AND THEY'RE OUT 
IT 
HOW MUCH DOES IT MEAN TO THE IT OWNER ROMAN ABRAMOVICH AND HOW MUCH 
DOES GRANT'S FUTURE PENNED ON MAYBE 
THE RESULT NEXT WEEK AS WELL I I THINK IT MEANS A LOT TO HIM IT'S 
ONE THING THEY NEED TO WIN THEY'VE 
WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP A COUPLE OF 
TIMES NOW THIS IS THE NEXT 
OUTSTANDING THING TO DRIVE THE CLUB 
FORWARD I THINK IT'S A BIG ASK FOR 
AVRAM GRANT AT THE MOMENT WHETHER 
HIS JOB IS ON THE LINE WE HAVE TO 
WAIT AND SEE THERE IS A BIG GAME 
IN BETWEEN WITH MANCHESTER UNITED 
AT THE WEEKEND 
PREDICTION FOR 
TONIGHT 
I THINK A DRAW A LOT ARE TONIGHT SAYING THE SAME THING 
CHELSEA HAVE 
LOST THE PREVIOUS TWO ENCOUNTERS 
AGAINST LIVERPOOL THIRD TIME 
LUCKY LUCKY YOU CAN LISTEN TO THAT MATCH 
LIVERPOOL AND CHELSEA IN THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI FINAL ON B. B. C. 
LONDON FORTY NINE NINE HUNDRED FORTY NINE FROM SEVEN HUNDRED 
THE SUN HAOS BEEN SHINING TODAY 
LET'S FIND OUT IS IT GOING TO STAY 
WITH US 
LOOKING RELAXED THERE PETE 
YES I AM IN BERKLEY SQUARE THIS 
EVENING IN AMONGST THE TREES MARK 
WAS TALKING ABOUT A FEW MOMENTS AGO 
IT'S WORTH BEARING IN MIND THAT 
PLANE TREES ARE PRETTY GOOD AT 
CLEANING UP AIR POLLUTION 
THEY'RE NOT ALL OLD TREES HERE 
THEY ARE THERE ARE SOME YOUNGER 
TREES AND THEY'LL BE PLEASED WITH 
THE WEATHER FOR THE WEEK BECAUSE 
WE HAVE SOME GOOD GROWING WEATHER 
TO LOOK FORWARD TO 
WE HAVE SOME GOOD GROWING WEATHER TO LOOK FORWARD TO 
IT'S BEEN WARM 
TODAY AND THERE IS SOME RAIN IN THE 
FORECAST BUT NOT THIS EVENING IT 
SHOULD STAY DRY FOR THE END OF THE 
DAY A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE STILL 
TO ENJOY AS FAR AS TEMPERATURES 
ARE CONCERNED THEY'LL STAY IN 
DOUBLE FIGURES SIMILAR WEATHER UP 
IN LIVERPOOL FOR THAT GAME TO THE 
WEATHER THAT WE WILL HAVE IN LONDON 
TONIGHT THE TEMPERATURES SLIPPING 
AWAY TO SEVEN SEVEN OR EIGHT C. SO NOT COLD BUT 
A PROBLEM OF FOG THERE COULD BE 
DENSE FOG PATCHES TO WATCH OUT FOR 
TOMORROW MORNING BUT A FRESHENING 
SOUTHERLY BREEZE WILL HELP TO CLEAR 
THAT FOG AWAY IT WILL ALSO BLOW 
SOME RAIN ACROSS THE LONDON AREA 
YOU CAN SEE THERE MAINLY LIGHT 
PATCHY RAIN AND DESPITE THE WET 
WEATHER TOP TOP TEMPERATURES OF SIXTEEN 
OR SEVENTEEN C. NOT AS HIGH AS THAT TO THE 
WEST OF LONDON THAT'S BECAUSE THE 
WIND WILL INTRODUCE SOME FRESHER 
AIR AND CLEARER SKIES LATER IN THE 
DAY THE OUTLOOK IS FOR SOME MORE 
RAIN ON THURSDAY BUT THE WARM 
SUNSHINE SHOULD BE BACK WITH US ON 
FRIDAY SO ALL IN ALL PERFECT 
WEATHER FOR PLANTS 
TONIGHT'S MAIN HEADLINES THE 
CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING HAS 
BEEN MEETING LEADING MORTGAGE 
LENDERS ASKING THEM TO PASS ON CUTS 
IN INTEREST RATES TO HOME OWNERS 
THE B. B. C. HAS LEARNED THAT HUNDREDS 
OF AMERICAN TROOPS ARE FIGHTING IN 
BASRA ALONGSIDE THE IRAQI ARMY IN 
THEIR CAMPAIGN AGAINST MILITANT 
MILITIA GROUPS 
POLICE ARE URGING TRYING TO FIND A 
MAN WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES AFTER 
THE BODY OF HIS MOTHER WAS FOUND 
LAST NIGHT 
THE GOVERNMENT'S FACING FRESH CALLS 
TO END B. A. A.'S MONOPOLY OVER SOUTH 
EAST AIRPORTS THE COMMISSION HAS 
SAID IT MAY NOT BE SERVING WELL THE 
INTERESTS OF PASSENGERS 
HUNDREDS INCLUDING THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAVE ATTENDED A PRIVATE 
MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR STEVEN 
LAURENCE WHO WAS MURDERED FIFTEEN YEARS 
AGO THAT'S ALL FROM US I WILL BE 
BACK WITH THE LATEST AT ONE THOUSAND AND 
PLENTY MORE ON OUR WEBSITE OF 
COURSE FROM ALL OF US HERE HAVE A 
GOOD EVENING BYE 
MY NAME IS LINDSEY GERMAN 
AND I'M STANDING AS MAYOR OF LONDON FOR THE LEFT LIST 
I'VE BEEN A CAMPAIGNER ALL MY LIFE 
AND I'VE ORGANISED THE BIG ANTI WAR PROTESTS 
AGAINST THE WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 
WHICH BROUGHT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT ON TO THE STREETS OF LONDON 
I'M CAMPAIGNING FOR A LONDON 
WHICH IS NOT A LONDON A PLAYGROUND FOR THE RICH AND POWERFUL 
BUT WHICH IS A LONDON WHERE WORKING PEOPLE GET THE REAL BENEFIT 
OF LIFE HERE 
MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES STAND FOR MORE MONEY ON PUBLIC SERVICES 
WELFARE NOT WARFARE 
AN END TO PRIVATISATION 
AND LET'S SPEND SOME OF THE MONEY 
THAT AT PRESENT IS SPENT ON THE WAR IN IRAQ 
ON THE THINGS LONDONERS REALLY NEED 
WE'RE A CAMPAIGNING PARTY 
WE CAMPAIGNED AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ FROM THE VERY BEGINNING 
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE'VE GOT TEACHERS COLLEGE LECTURERS 
AND CIVIL SERVANTS STRIKING 
FOR A BETTER DEAL FROM THE NEW LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
WE THE LEFT LIST URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THEM 
WORKING PEOPLE ARE A LOT STRONGER IF THEIR UNIONS ARE STRONG 
MY NAME'S KRIS STEWART I'M A FOOTBALL FAN A WIMBLEDON FAN 
OUR CLUB WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US BY BIG BUSINESS 
AS PART OF A PROPERTY DEAL INSTEAD OF SITTING BACK AND TAKING IT 
WE DECIDED TO START AGAIN SO WE DID ON OUR OWN BY OURSELVES 
I WAS THE FOUNDING CHAIRMAN AND WE STARTED AGAIN FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE PYRAMID 
AS A GRASS ROOTS INITIATIVE 
NOW I'M STANDING FOR THE LEFT LIST IN THE GREATER LONDON ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS 
IT'S ANOTHER GRASS ROOTS INITIATIVE 
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY WE DON'T HAVE BIG BUSINESS BACKERS 
BUT WHAT WE DO DO IS STAND ALONGSIDE ORDINARY PEOPLE 
WHEN THEY FIGHT BACK AGAINST BIG BUSINESS 
THE LEFT LIST LOOKS LIKE WHAT LONDON REALLY LOOKS LIKE 
WE HAVE PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS 
WE HAVE YOUNG AND OLD WE HAVE BLACK AND WHITE PEOPLE OF RELIGIOUS FAITH AND NONE 
WHAT WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT WE ARE ALL ORDINARY WORKING PEOPLE 
WE NEED A LONDON RUN FOR ORDINARY LONDONERS 
NOT FOR PRIVATE FINANCE COMPANIES AND PROPERTY DEVELOPERS 
WHAT WE WANT ARE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES 
WHO REALLY SPEAK UP FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE IN LONDON 
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE SAME STREETS AS US 
WHO USE THE BUSES AND TUBES EVERY DAY 
AND WHOSE KIDS GO TO ORDINARY SCHOOLS 
PEOPLE WHO IF THEY FALL SICK 
KNOW THEY NEED TO RELY ON THE N. H. S. TO MAKE THEM WELL AGAIN 
WHAT WE DON'T NEED ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR US 
HERE AT HOME IN LONDON WE'RE FACING A TERRORIST THREAT 
AND NEW LABOUR'S RESPONSE TO THIS TERRORIST THREAT 
DOES NOTHING BUT FUEL ISLAMAPHOBIA AND THREATEN OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY SPENT THREE POINT FIVE BILLION ON THE WAR 
IMAGINE WHAT THAT MONEY COULD HAVE DONE 
IF IT WAS SPENT ON OUR PUBLIC SERVICES HERE IN LONDON 
THIS MADNESS HAS GOT TO STOP 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BRING THE TROOPS HOME IMMEDIATELY 
AND THE MESSAGE SHOULD GO OUT TODAY FROM ALL OF US 
SAYING THAT LONDON IS A CITY OF PEACE 
VERY MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES 
VERY MANY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BEING FAILED 
BY A SYSTEM THAT IS FAR TOO IMBALANCED 
IMBALANCED FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THOSE IN POWER 
GIVING A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION AND PRIVILEGE AND OPPORTUNITY 
TO THOSE WHO ALREADY HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF PRIVILEGE AND OPPORTUNITY 
WE ON THE LEFT STAND FOR THE PENSIONERS THE TRADE UNIONISTS 
THE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE AND FOR THE ETHNIC MINORITY PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE BEEN BADLY LET DOWN BY NEW LABOUR 
AND GORDON BROWN AND TONY BLAIR FOR A DECADE 
AND I THINK WE NEED CHANGE 
NEXT SUNDAY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
WILL BE COMING TO VICTORIA PARK IN LONDON'S EAST END 
TO A FREE LOVE MUSIC HATE RACISM CARNIVAL 
TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST RACISM AND FASCISM 
LONDON IS A MULTICULTURAL CITY 
AND IT'S ALL THE BETTER FOR IT 
WE REALLY NEED A LONDON WHICH IS FOR LONDONERS 
AND FOR PEOPLE WHO DO THE WORK IN THIS CITY 
RATHER THAN THE PEOPLE THE TINY WEALTHY MINORITY IN THE CITY 
THE ONLY PARTY THAT IS GOING TO STAND UP CONSISTENTLY 
FOR THE POOR AND THE UNDERPRIVILEGED AND THE DEPRIVED 
AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN UNJUSTLY TREATED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT 
BY THE PEOPLE WHO RUN LONDON 
THOSE PEOPLE WILL HAVE A VOICE THROUGH THE LEFT LIST 
WE BELIEVE IN DEFENDING PUBLIC SERVICES 
AND REDUCING THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR 
AND THAT'S WHAT MOST LONDONERS WANT 
I WANT YOU TO VOTE FOR THE LEFT LIST ON FIRST MAY 
FOR THE VOICE OF THE VOICELESS TO BE HEARD 
MY NAME'S LINDSEY GERMAN 
AND I'M STANDING FOR MAYOR OF LONDON FOR THE LEFT LIST 
YOU CAN VOTE LEFT LIST THREE TIMES ON MAY FIRST 
FOR MAYOR IN YOUR CONSTITUENCY 
AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL ON THE LONDON WIDE LIST
