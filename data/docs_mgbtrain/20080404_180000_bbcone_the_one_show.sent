CHANCE THAT I'M NOT THERE I THINK

LIVERPOOL 
THAT MADE ME FEEL LIVERPOOL HOMESICK IT IS AROUND THE CORNER 
FROM OUR MARG MY SISTER 
YOUR DAD 
WAS A BOOKIE 
YES IN THOSE DAYS MY 
DAD WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE HE 
ALWAYS SAID ONCE HE BECAME A BOOKIE 
HE WAS INTO BETTING BEFORE BUT 
ONCE HE BECAME A BOOKIE HE SAID IT 
WAS A MUG'S GAME AND NEVER BET 
AGAIN 
ON ANYTHING OR ON THE AGAIN NATIONAL 
WELL HE WOULD HAVE A NATIONAL FLUTTER ON THE NATIONAL WE AS A 
FAMILY STILL DO THAT COMPLY OR DIE 
I WAS TOLD 
WHAT ABOUT YOU L. ONLY 
I ONLY HAVE FLUTTER IN MY MIND L. PICK 
HORSE DON'T PUT A BET ON AND BE 
GUTTED WHEN IT WINS 
IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH THE NAME YES 
FOR ME YES LIVERPOOL BACK BEAT BEATLES IT 
IS EIGHTY TO ONE 
THOSE THINGS NEVER WORK 
THERE WAS AN ELECTION YEAR WHEN 
PARTY POLITICS WON AND EVERYONE 
THOUGHT IT WAS TOO OBVIOUS AND THEN 
HE WON 
WHEN I WAS A KID A HORSE 
WON AND IT WAS A ONE HUNDRED TO ONE OUTSIDER AND 
ALL THE HORSES FELL AND THIS ONE 
HORSE WENT THROUGH AND I THINK ALL 
THE BOOKIES WENT BROKE THAT YEAR 
LUCK OF THE DRAW WELL MEL DANE IS 
HERE TO LOOK AT THE GROWING NUMBER 
OF NEW MOTHERS QUICKLY RESORTING TO 
SURGERY TO RESTORE THEIR FIGURES TO 
FORMER GLORIES AS WITH MOST 
DISTURBING TRENDS THE FINGER OF 
BLAME POINTS SQUARELY AT THE 
CELEBRITIES WHOSE APPARENTLY MANIC 
PURSUIT OF PHYSICAL PERFECTION WE 
ALL SEEM TO WANT TO EMULATE SHR 
CELEBRITY MUMS THEY SING AND ACT 
AND EVEN PERFORM THE MAGIC TRICK OF 
MAKING THEIR POST BABY WEIGHT 
DISAPPEAR JUST LIKE THAT BUT FOR 
THE MAJORITY OF MUMS WHO DON'T HAVE 
A PERSONAL TRAINER THERE IS AN 
ALTERNATIVE WAY TO A WASHBOARD 
TUMMY THE YUMMY JOB AS A MUM OF 
THREE I KNOW ONLY TOO WELL WHAT 
HAVING A BABY CAN DO FOR YOUR BODY 
I DECIDED EXERCISE AND HEALTHY 
EATING WAS THE BEST WAY FORWARD IT 
DOES SEEM IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE L. 
WANT TO KNOW WHY SO MANY MUMS ARE 
CONSIDERING POST BIRTH SURGERY AND 
IS HAVING MUMMYJOB THE ONLY WAY 
TO GET BACK INTO SHAPE 
THE ONE SHOW VIEWER KARENZA GAVE 
BIRTH TO MOLLY CHARLIE AND HARRY 
THREE MONTHS AGO SHE THINKS HER 
TRIO ARE TEFBG BUT HE DOESN'T FEEL 
THE SAME WAY ABOUT HER POST BUMP 
BODY HER TRIO ARE TERRIFIC 
AT WHAT POINT DID YOU FIND OUT YOU 
WERE HAVING TRIPLETS 
AT THIRTEEN WEEKS 
THE LADY SAID CAN YOU SEE THAT 
MY HUSBAND SAID TWINS SHE SAID 
NO THEN SHE SAID THREE THE THE TRIPLETS WEIGHED FIVE L. B. S. EACH 
ALTHOUGH KARENZA ENJOYED BEING 
PREGNANT SHE HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT 
WOULD DO TO HER BODY 
I STUPIDLY 
THOUGHT I WOULD GO BACK TO NORMAL 
YOU HAVE AN IDEA YOU WOULD GET A 
FLAT STOMACH 
TEN WEEKS ON I STILL 
HAVE A TUMMY 
IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE 
NOW BETWEEN EXERCISE AND GOING 
UNDER THE KNIFE WHAT WOULD YOU 
CHOOSE 
I 
WOULD LIKE TO THINK I CHOOSE WOULD DO THE EXERCISE ROUTE FIRST 
AND GIVE IT A PROPER GO BUT IF IT 
WAS THAT I SAID I HAD DONE IT FOR 
SIX MONTHS AND IT IS STILL NOT GONE 
DOWN OR STILL DOESN'T LOOK I WOULD 
START TO MAKE INVESTIGATIONS ABOUT 
IT IT IN FACT A RECENT SURVEY FOUND THAT 
HALF THE WOMEN INTERVIEWED AFTER 
GIVING BIRTH WOULD CONSIDER 
COSMETIC SURGERY KARENZA AND I 
HAVE COME TO HARLEY STREET TO LOOK 
AT THE OPTIONS BY THE END OF THE 
TODAY LSURGERY BE ONE OF THEM I I GUESS THE ONE THING THAT ALWAYS IS 
IN THE BACK OF MY MIND IS HOW MUCH 
ARE YOU TALKING 
FOR BREAST AND 
TUMMY IT IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 
FIVE THOUSAND AND TEN THOUSAND 
I WAS JUST 
WONDERING WHAT THE RECOVERY PERIOD 
IS AFTER THAT KIND OF PROCEDURE 
THIS PLASTIC SURGEON RECKONS A 
MUMMY JOB IS LESS DO WITH LOOKS AND 
MORE ABOUT GIVING MOTHERS BACK 
THEIR CONFIDENCE 
THEY FEEL THAT 
THEIR IDENTITY HAS CHANGED FROM 
BEING BEFORE AND AFTER PREGNANCY 
THEY LOOK AT THEMSELVES AND THEY 
DON'T RECOGNISE THEMSELVES SO WHAT 
YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IS RESTORE 
THEM AND VERY COMMONLY YOU WILL 
HEAR LOOK I JUST WANT BACK WHAT I 
HAD BEFORE 
BUT SURELY EXERCISE AND 
HEALTHY EATING WILL BE ENOUGH FOR 
WOMEN TO GET BACK INTO SHAPE IT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IF 
IT IS PURELY ABOUT WEIGHT OF 
COURSE DIET AND EXERCISE ARE OF 
PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE THE ONLY 
PROBLEM IS THIS DEVELOPMENT OF 
EXCESS SKIN AND SO CONTRARY TO 
POPULAR BELIEF HOWEVER MUCH DIET 
OR EXERCISING YOU DO YOU WILL 
NEVER GET RID OF THAT THAT'S A 
SURPLUS OF SKIN WHICH CAN ONLY BE 
REMOVED BY SURGERY 
BUT THIS LEADING NUTRITIONIST AND 
MUM OF THREE DOESN'T THINK THAT 
SURGERY IS THE ANSWER 
IT IS JUST NOT NATURAL L. THINK 
DIET YES CAN SOLVE ALL YOUR 
PROBLEMS IF YOU EAT PROPERLY YOU 
WILL LOSE WEIGHT FLOSS QUESTION 
ABOUT IT IT IS QUITE QUICK TO MAKE 
THINGS YOURSELF THAT ARE HEALTHY 
AND NUTRITIOUS AND WON'T PUT THE 
WEIGHT ON SOMETHING YOU NEED WHEN 
YOU HAVE GIVEN BIRTH IS IRON YOU 
DO LOSE BLOOD WHEN YOU GIVE BIRTH 
AND MANY MANY WOMEN PARTICULARLY 
ANYBODY WHO IS VEGETARIAN WILL BE 
IRON DEFICIENT 
THAT'S ME AND I WAS 
IT TAKES A WHILE TO SHIFT YOUR 
WEIGHT IT IS DIFFICULT AND YOU 
WILL GET BACK INTO SHAPE IT 
DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU TAKES SIX 
MONTHS AT LEAST SPEND THE FIRST 
NINE MONTHS TO YEAR WITH YOUR 
CHILD THEN THINK ABOUT IT YOU MAY 
HAVE FOUND BY THEN YOU ARE BACK IN 
SHAPE ANYWAY 
WHATEVER SHAPE THEY 
ARE IN THIS DOCTOR SAYS NEW MUMS 
SHOULD WAIT A YEAR BEFORE EVEN 
CONSIDERING SURGERY 
MY KEY CONCERN 
COSMETIC SURGERY IN THE FIRST TWELVE 
MONTHS IS THAT IT IS BEING DONE FOR 
THE RIGHT REASONS SO WOMEN HAVE 
CONSIDERED THE ISSUE OF POST NATAL 
DEPRESSION THE NORMALITY IS TO PUT 
ON SOME WEIGHT IN PREGNANCY AND TO 
LOOK SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE 
YOU WERE PREGNANT AND TO FEEL 
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AS WELL L. 
THINK THAT WE SHOULD CELEBRATE AND 
EMBRACE THAT RATHER THAN FIGHTING 
AGAINST IT 
WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF OPINIONS 
TODAY SO HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR 
MIND ON THE MUMMY JOB 
I DON'T 
THINK SURGE HAVE I RIGHT FOR ME AT 
THE MOMENT L. WANT IT WAIT THAT SIX 
TO TWELVE MONTHS TO SEE WHERE I AM AND 
IN THAT TIME DO MY EXERCISE TRY 
AND EAT HEALTHLY IT IS GREAT 
KNOWING WHERE I CAN GO HOW MUCH IT 
COSTS WHAT IT INVOLVES BUT FOR 
NOW IT IS THE EXERCISE AND EAT 
HEALTHY THE HEALTHY ROUTE FOR ME 
THAT'S KIND OF SENSIBLE OPTION IN 
THE END ISN'T IT SURELY 
IT IS L. 
WAS SO GLAD KARENZA OPTED FOR THAT 
I THINK IT IS SO REALISTIC FOR NEW 
MUMS TO THINK THEY ARE GOING TO 
SPRING BACK INTO SHAPE OR TO TOOK 
AT CELEBRITIES AS AN EXAMPLE THAT 
ISN'T NORMALITY IT TAKES SO LONG 
IT IS NINE MONTHS FOR YOUR BODY TO 
CHANGE 
AT LEAST 
ABSOLUTELY IT IS CHANGE GOING TO BE AT LEAST A YEAR IF YOU 
GO BACK TO NORMAL IF NOT TWO TO TO BE FAIR TO CELEBRITIES POSH SPICE 
IT PROBABLY TOOK THEM SOMETIME TO 
LOSE IT BUT YOU SEE THE PICTURES IN 
THE PAPER THEY ARE PROBABLY 
DOCTORED ANYWAY 
THAT'S TRUE WHAT 
YOU ARE SEEING ISN'T THE REALITY 
YOU ARE SEEING THEM GOING FROM 
HEAVILY PREGNANT TO A CERTAIN 
AMOUNT OF TIME ELAPSED AND THEY ARE 
LOOKING THEIR BEST THEY ARE 
DRESSED WELL HAIR AND MAKE UP IS 
DONE IT ISN'T GENUINE PICTURE IT 
IS NOT WHAT YOU SEE AS A NEW MUM 
YOUR PARTNER IS EXPECTING BABY SOON 
WHAT IS YOUR ATTITUDE TO THIS WE WE ARE GOING FOR NATURAL CHILDBIRTH 
AS FAR AS I KNOW CLAIRE REALLY 
WANTS TO GET BACK IN SHAPE 
NATURALLY NATURALLY FOR A MAN IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY 
ISN'T IT BECAUSE WE ARE NOT IN 
THAT SITUATION 
YOU CAN'T SAY A 
WORD RIGHT CAN YOU L. WILL PIPE 
DOWN NOW IF I WAS YOU 
YOU I HEARD 
THAT BREAST FEEDING WAS ONE OF THE 
BEST WAYS TO GET BACK INTO SHAPE 
IT IS TRUE I BREAST FED ALL THREE 
OF MY CHILDREN IT MAKES HUGE 
DIFFERENCE IT BURNS UP LOTS OF 
CALORIES AND TTS BEST POSSIBLE 
THING FOR YOUR BABY 
AND IT IS THE BEST POSSIBLE THING FOR YOUR 
BABY 
THERE IS PRESSURE FOR BABY CELEBRITIES 
YOU MUST HAVE FELT IT CELEBRITIES I DIDN'T WASN'T GOING 
TO DO THAT TO MYSELF WHEN I WAS A BABY 
WHEN I HAD THE BABYTIVES CHUFFED 
AND I WAS CHUFFED THAT EYE MADE A 
BABY I DID IT GRADUALLY 
HERE IS A 
CUTE BABY THAT'S LES DENNIS LESLY LESLY HESELTINE 
NO 
RELATION SURELY NO HESELTINE NO RELATION THAT I KNOW OF ANYWAY 
VERY CUTE AND THIS WOMAN BY THE 
WAY WAS IN THE PAPERS RECENTLY 
SUSAN TOLLEFSEN GAVE BIRTH AT THE 
RIPE OLD AGE OF FIFTY SEVEN IF YOU HAVE 
BECOME A PARENT IN LATER LIFE WE 
WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU 
OR IF YOU ARE A CHILD OF AN ORL 
PARENT YOU CAN GET IN TOUCH 
ONE NEW MOTHER ON OUR BOOKS IS OF 
WUN SHOW'S IS THE ONE SHOW'S 
MUSICAL MAESTRO MYLENE KLASS SHE 
HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE ORIGINS OF 
OUR COUNTRY'S CLASSIC SONGS SHE IS 
IN YORKSHIRE TODAY FINDING OUT WHAT 
ON EARTH 
ILKLEY MOOR BAHT AT MEANS ILKLEY MOOR BAHT AT IT IS A SONG 
EVERYONE ASSOCIATES WITH GOD'S OWN 
COUNTY BUT HOW DID A STRANGE 
DIALECT PIECE COME TO SYMBOLISE 
YORKSHIRE AND JUST WHAT DOES IT ALL 
MEAN MEAN YORKSHIRE'S METHODIST CHAPEL HAS A 
STRONG SINGING TRADITION AND ILKLEY 
MOOR BAHT AT COMES FROM THAT 
CHOIRS COMBINED SINGING WITH 
RAMBLING AND USED PLACES LIKE THIS 
TO INSPIRE THEM BUT THEIR SONGS 
WEREN'T ALWAYS EITHER RELIGIOUS OR 
EVEN SERIOUS AND IN THE CASE OF 
ILKLEY MOOR BAHT AT IT SEEMS THE 
CHOIR MAY JUST HAVE BEEN HAVING A 
LITTLE FUN AT THE SPENCE OF A 
YOUNG COUPLE ALTOGETHER ALTOGETHER ON ILKLEY MOOR BAHT AT 
ON ILKLEY MOOR BAHT AT A LAD SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE MAIN 
PARTY WITH HIS LASS TO DO A BIT OF 
COURTING I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT 
BECAUSE I USED TO DO THAT MYSELF 
AND YOU HAVE BEEN MARRIED HOW MANY 
YEARS 
I SLIPPED AWAY WITH A YEARS YORKSHIRE LASS WE HAVE BEEN 
MARRIED FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS THIS LAD 
SLIPPED AWAY AND WHEN HE CAME BACK 
THE LADS STARTING PULLING HIS LEG 
WHERE WERE YOU GOING WHEN I SAW YOU 
GOING OVER ILKLEY MOOR WITHOUT A 
HAT HAT 
ON ILKLEY MOOR BAHT AT IN 
THOSE DAYS EVERYBODY WAR A HAT BUT 
HE LEFT HIS BEHIND OR HE LOST IT 
DURING A ROMP IN THE HEATHER AND HE 
WAS GOING TO GET HIS DEATH OF COLD 
HE IS BOUND TO CATCH HIS DEATH OF 
COLD AND THEN WE SHALL HAVE TO BURY 
AND THEN WORM ALSO COME AND ATE 
THEE UP AND THEN DUCKS WILL COME 
AND AT UP WORMS THEN WE WILL COME 
AND A TE DUCKS THERE ARE NINERS 
HAVES IT IS JUST A BIT OF FUN IT 
WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM HISTORY 
COMPLETELY BUT THEY HAPPENED TO 
SING IT TO THEIR FAVOURITE HIM TUNE 
OF CANBROOK 
CRANBROOK 
THE TUNE HAD NO SET CRANBROOK WORDS CHOIRS SANG DIFFERENT WORDS 
AND IN YORKSHIRE THEY WENT FOR 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO THE WORDS WE 
KNOW TODAY 
YORKSHIRE FOLK DON'T 
LIKE TO ADMIT IT BUT IT WAS WRITTEN 
BY A SOUTHERNER AT THAT CHAP FROM 
CANTERBURY THOMAS CLARKE WHO WAS A 
CONDUCTOR OF METHODIST CHOIRS BUT 
IN YORKSHIRE IT BECAME ESPECIALLY 
POPULAR FOR WHILE SHEPHERDS WATCH 
THEIR FLOCKS BY NIGHT 
WOULD YOU 
LIKE TO HAVE A GO 
ON ONE CONDITION YOU DO IT WITH ME 
IT IS NOT THE MOST CHEERFUL SONG 
YET YORKSHIRE PEOPLE HAVE EMBRACED 
IT 
DOUSE THERE IS A DOUR YORKSHIRE IT HUMOUR THE WORDS ARE TRIVIAL SOME 
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THEM MANY DON'T 
UNDERSTAND THEM BUT THE TUNE HAS 
CARRIED CARRIED AND GLORY SHONE AROUND 
WELL THIS TUNE MAY HAVE ITS ROOTS 
DOWN SOUTH BUT NOW IT DEFINITELY 
BELONGS TO YORKSHIRE AND WHEN IT 
YORKSHIRE HARROGATE BRASS BAND 
TAKE IT AWAY 
THE HARROGATE BRASS BAND MUST BE 
KEEN ON PUBLICITY AND EXPOSURE 
THEY WILL GET EXPOSURE ILKLEY MOOR 
BHAT AT L. KNOW THERE'S HAIL

FANTASTIC PETER GLAZE 
THE TITLE OF 
YOUR AUTOBIOGRAPHY MUST THE SHOW GO 
ON IT DOESN'T SUGGEST IT HAS ALL

PARTNER DUSTIN AND I ALWAYS WENT 
ON STAGE AFTERWARDS NOW I DON'T 
BELIEVE IN THAT ALTHOUGH THERE'S 
AS IN ANY LIFE AND CAREER THERE 
HAVE BEEN UPS AND DOWN IT'S NOT 
MISERY ALTHOUGH MUST THE SHOW GO 
ON 
A BIT LIKE THE SHANKLY THING ON NOT BEING TRUE THAT FOOTBALL IS 
MORE IMPORTANT THAN LIFE AND DEATH

IN LIFE THAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT IF

HARRISON WENT TO SEE SOMEONE WHO 
KNOWS HIS DOGS KEITH MATTHEWS A 
DOG TRAINER ON A MISSION HE HAS 
WORKED WITH THOUSANDS OF DOGS AND 
THEIR OWNERS HE HAS TACKLED EVERY 
PROBLEM A DOG COULD HAVE THERE'S 
NOT ENOUGH RESEARCH INTO CHOOSING A 
BREED PEOPLE 
BREED A THEY PICK BREED ON THE LOOKS KEITH IS GOING 
TO HELP FIND A ONE SHOW VIEWER A 
DOG AND SET THEM ON THE RIGHT PATH 
WE'RE HERE TO MEET CHRIS WOOLSEY 
WHY DO YOU WANT A DOG 
WE ARE TWO 
DOGS FROM THE R. S. P. C. A. 
ANOTHER RESCUE 
DOG NOT A PUPPY 
I DON'T SEE THE 
POINT OF PAYING FOR A PUP HAD YOU 
CAN GET A HOME RESCUE DOG 
WHAT ARE 
YOUR QUESTIONS 
THE MAIN CONCERNS 
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A ESTABLISHED 
PACK CHRIS HAS TWO DOGS AND HE 
WANTS TO INTRODUCE A NEW MEMBER TO 
THE PACK WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHO 
IS IN CONTROL OF THE EXISTING PACK 
IS IT CHRIS OR ONE OF THE DOGS 
KEITH HAS BROUGHT CHRIS TO THE DOG 
SHELTER BEFORE THAT HAPPENS KEITH 
NEEDS TO SEE CHRIS WITH HIS DOGS 
LADY AND SASHA HE NEEDS TO SEE IF 
THE PACK IS READY FOR A NEW 
DECISION 
I WANT TO SEE WHAT CHRIS DECISION CAN DO WITH THE DOGS I'LL ASK HIM 
TO WALK THE DOGS AROUND THE PADDOCK 
LET THEM OFF SEE IF HE CAN GET 
THEM TO SIT AND STAY 
DO YOU NOTICE 
THAT THE TWO DOGS ARE LEADING CHRIS 
THEY'RE ALWAYS IN FRONT THEY'RE 
PULLING A LOT THAT INDICATES TO ME 
THEY ARE LEADERS THE LEADERS 
ALWAYS WALK IN THE FRONT OF THE 
PACK CAN YOU MAKE THEM SIT SIT SIT GOOD GIRL SASHA 
YOU CAN SEE CHRIS 
HAS TOLD LADY TO SIT SASHA HAS NOT 
RESPONDED 
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S TWO RESPONDED DOGS BOTH SHOULD RESPOND AND LADY 
AND SHE STOOD UP AND SAID I'VE DONE IT HOW WILL SASHA AND LADY 
RESPOND TO A STRANGER 
LET THEM OFF 
THE LEAD THEY MAY COME TO ME OR 
NOT I WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN GET 
THEM BACK YOU NOTICE WHEN I COME 
IN WITH A DISTRACTION AND MADE A 
NOISE THE DOGS STARTED TO BECOME 
PROTECTIVE AS WELL AND SHE STARTED 
TO COME UP TO ME AND BARK SOMEONE 
MAY TURN TO HIM AND SAY A DOG MADE 
AN ATTACK ON ME SHE SHOULD NOT 
HAVE DONE THAT AT ALL 
WHAT IS THAT 
BARKING 
SHE'S BECOMING PROTECTIVE BARKING SO SHE IS THAT'S NOT GOOD THE DOG 
SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT YOU KNOW 
I'LL AVERT MY GAZE SO I DON'T 
INTIMIDATE HER 
TESTING OVER IT'S 
TIME FOR THE VERDICT AND IT'S NOT 
GOOD NEWS FOR LADY THE LARGER OF 
THE TWO DOGS 
WHEN I COME IN WHEN 
I WAS A DISTRACTION SHE WENT INTO 
ATTACK MODE 
AND LAUNCHED AND JUMPED ON ME THAT SHOWS ME 
SHE'S IN CONTROL AND SHE'S 
PROTECTING THE PACK HER 
SUBORDINATE IS THIS MAN THAT 
SHOULD BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND 
BEFORE ANOTHER DOG IS BROUGHT INTO 
THE ENVIRONMENT CHRIS HAS TO EXERT 
HIMSELF AS THE ALPHA THE LEADER 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I WOULD AGREE 
SHE JUMPED UP ON HIM AND THAT'S NOT 
WHAT WE WANT THEY ARE OUT OF THEIR 
ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S DAUNTING FOR 
THEM 
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU WANT TO THEM GIVE A RESCUE DOG A HOME L. DON'T 
THINK THE TIME IS RIGHT ESTABLISH 
A BIT OF CONTROL OVER THE DOGS YOU 
HAVE AND AFTER A TIME INTRODUCE THE 
DOGS INTO THAT SITUATION 
KEITH HAS 
BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO JOIN US THE 
IMPORTANT THING IS TO TRAIN DOGS 
THE REALITY IS PEOPLE HAVE TO TAKE 
THE TIME BEFORE THEY GET A DOG YOU 
HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF DOES THE 
PERSONALITY SUIT YOU DO YOU TIME 
TO WALK THE DOG TIME TO LOOK AFTER 
IT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY DO YOU 
HAVE TIME TO TRAIN THE DOG FORTY PER CENT OF 
THE DOGS IN THE COUNTRY ARE CLASSED 
AS PROBLEM DOGS YOU DON'T WANT TO 
HAVE ONE 
YOU WOULD NOT EXPECT A 
BABY TO COME INTO THE WORLD AND NOT 
TRAIN THEM 
MOST DEFINITELY LOT 
MAKES ME FEEL HOME SICK THE ACCENT

GREAT TIME IN THE CAPITAL OF
