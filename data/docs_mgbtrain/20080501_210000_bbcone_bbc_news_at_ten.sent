THIS IS KYLE FISHER HEALTHY 
LITTLE BOY AND THIS IS THE WOMAN

LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN 
SHORTLY BEFORE HIS DEATH LOOK AT 
KYLE'S RIGHT EYE THE EVIDENCE THAT 
THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG STARES AT

THE COURT OF APPEAL QUASHED THE 
CONVICTION AGAINST SUZANNE 
HOLDSWORTH IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE 
ORIGINAL TRIAL THAT KYLE WAS 
FUNDAMENTALLY A HEALTHY LITTLE BOY 
BUT THE APPEAL COURT HEARD THAT NOT 
ONLY DID HE HAVE A GENETIC BRAIN 
ABNORMALITY BUT ALSO BRAIN 
INJURY BOTH OF WHICH COULD HAVE 
KILLED HIM THE INJURY HAPPENED A 
YEAR BEFORE HE DIED WHILE HE WAS

CRASH THERE WERE NO DEFENCE 
EXPERTS AT THE ORIGINAL TRIAL SIXTY 
M. P. H. CAR CRASH CLEVELAND POLICE DID 
NOT TAKE STATEMENTS FROM EITHER THE 
BRAIN SURGEON OR THE FACE SURGEON 
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
CONTACTED WE HAD POTENTIALLY 
USEFUL INFORMATION AND WE SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR A STATEMENT WE WE UNDERSTAND THE CLEVELAND POLICE 
MURDER INQUIRY DID INVESTIGATE 
KYLE'S BRAIN INJURY AND DECIDED 
THAT IT WAS IRRELEVANT TODAY'S 
JUDGEMENT IS BASED ON ENTIRELY THE 
OPPOSITE VIEW FOR JUSTICE TO BE 
DONE A JURY SHOULD HEAR ABOUT 
KYLE'S EXISTING BRAIN INJURY THAT 
ALONE COULD HAVE KILLED HIM 
DISPUTED MEDICAL EVIDENCE HAS 
CAUSED TROUBLE BEFORE SALLY CLARKE 
FOUND GUILTY OF MURDERING HER TWO 
BABY BOYS HER CONVICTION WAS

THE REST OF OUT THE RACE TO COUNT 
THE VOTES IS UNDER WAY IN THE 
BIGGEST ELECTORAL TEST SINCE GORDON 
BROWN BECAME PRIME MINISTER FOUR THOUSAND 
COUNCIL SEATS ARE AT STAKE IN 
LONDON THE CONSERVATIVES BORIS 
JOHNSON IS FIGHTING TO UNSEAT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE WHERE ARE THE KEY 
BATTLEGROUNDS 
HOW DO WE JUDGE WHAT BATTLEGROUNDS HAPPENS TONIGHT ONE WAY IS TO LOOK 
AT THE LOCAL ELECTION RESULTS LAST 
YEAR REMEMBER TONY BLAIR WAS 
PRIME MINISTER AND THEY WERE THE 
LAST ONE SLEAFORD HE DID VERY 
BADLY ALMOST LABOUR'S LOWEST EVER 
THE LAST ONES HE FOUGHT FORTY PER CENT 
GENERALLY REGARDED AS THE MAGIC 
NUMBER WHEN YOU CAN START THINKING 
ABOUT WINNING A GENERAL ELECTION 
THE LIB DEMS TWENTY SIX PER CENT GOT MENZIES 
CAMPBELL EJECTED FROM OFFICE THEY 
NEED TO DO BETTER 
IT'S ENGLAND AND WALES VOTING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE 
COUNCILS INCLUDING ALL TWENTY TWO IN WALES 
THE GREY AREAS ARE WHERE THE VOTES 
ARE HAPPENING ALMOST NOTHING IN 
THE SOUTH WEST EXCEPT FOR EXETER 
AND PLYMOUTH YOU CAN SEE THE 
AMOUNT OF GLOOP WHICH IS WHY THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE SAYING IT IS VERY 
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MAKE ANY REAL 
GAINS AMOUNT OF BLUE SOME 
INDIVIDUAL COUNCILS THIS ONE IS 
HELD BY LABOUR EIGHTY PER CENT SWING TO PLAID 
CYMRU THE WELSH NATIONALISTS 
WOULD MAKE IT A HUNG COUNCIL TWO PER CENT 
SWING IN CHELTENHAM A HUNG 
COUNCIL LIB DEMS AND CONSERVATIVES 
THE SAME AMOUNT OF SEATS SIX PER CENT SWING 
WOULD GIVE IT TO THE CONSERVATIVES 
INTERESTING RENDITION OF THE BATTLE 
BETWEEN NICK CLEGG AND DAVID 
CAMERON IN CHELTENHAM READING IS 
LABOUR A RED DOT IN THE SOUTH EAST 
THEY HAVE HAD IT FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS 
CONSERVATIVES CAN TAKE IT WITH A FOUR PER CENT 
SWING LIVERPOOL IS LIB DEM BUT A 
VERY BAD AUDIT REPORT LIVERPOOL 
MADE GAINS LAST YEAR LABOUR MADE 
TRENDS AGAINST THE YEAR LABOUR 
MADE GAINS LAST YEAR AND THEY WILL 
HOPE TO TAKE LIVERPOOL 
GOING BACK EIGHT YEARS TO THE FIRST 
MAYOR CONTEST WON BY KEN 
LIVINGSTONE BORIS JOHNSON 
CHALLENGING HIM AND BRIAN PADDICK 
FOR THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS THE 
CANDIDATES HAVE TAKEN A BATTERING 
AS THE POLES HAVE TIGHTENED IN 
MARCH SOME INTERNET POLING FORTY NINE PER CENT 
WERE SAYING BORIS JOHNSON 
POLLING IN APRIL KEN LIVINGSTONE 
WAS FRACTIONALLY AHEAD THE OUTCOME 
OF ALL THIS IN LONDON MAY WELL SET 
THE POLITICAL WEATHER IN THE DAYS 
AND WEEKS TO COME 
YOU CAN WATCH THE ELECTION RESULTS 
AS THEY COME IN TONIGHT ON T. V. 
RADIO AND ONLINE DAVID DIMBLEBY 
PRESENTS ELECTION NIGHT ON B. B. C. ONE 
FROM ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE P. M. YOU CAN FOLLOW THE 
RESULTS ONLINE AT 
B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U. K. SLASH ELECTIONS 
ZIMBABWE'S ELECTORAL COMMISSION HAS 
PRESENTED SOME RESULTS FROM THE 
RECENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS TO AN 
ALL PARTY MEETING OFFICIALS SAY 
THAT THE OPPOSITION LEADER MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI WON FORTY EIGHT PER CENT AHEAD OF 
PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE'S FORTY THREE PER CENT A 
SOURCE AT THE MEETING TOLD THE B. B. C. 
THERE WOULD BE PROCESS TO AGREE 
THE FINAL RESULTS 
DID JOSEF FRITZL CAREER AT HIS 
SHOCKING CRIMES ALONE AUSTRIAN 
POLICE SAY THE SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD ENGINEER 
HAD NO ACCOMPLICES WHEN HE RAPED 
HIS DAUGHTER AND LOCKED HER IN A 
CELLAR FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS BUT NOW A 
LODGER WHO LIVED IN THE HOUSE IN 
AMSTETTEN HAS TOLD THE B. B. C. HE SAW 
ANOTHER MAN ENTER THE CELLAR STEVE 
ROSENBAUM REPORTS 
HE HAD LOCKED UP HIS OWN DAUGHTER 
IN HIS CELLAR BUT JOSEF FRITZL WAS 
SO CONFIDENT HIS SECRET HAD BEEN 
BURIED UNDERGROUND THAT UPSTAIRS 
HE TOOK IN LODGERS FOR TWELVE YEARS 
ALFRED DUBANOVSKY ALFRED 
DUBANOVSKY RENTED A ROOM IN HIS 
HOUSE 
WAS SUCH A HOUSE STRANGE GUY NONE OF THE LODGERS 
WERE ALLOWED INTO THE CELLAR OR 
ALLOWED TO TAKE ANY PHOTOGRAPHS OF 
THE GARDEN HE SAID IT WAS HIS 
PRIVATE AREA AND HE DID NOT WANT 
ANYONE THERE ONLY HE ALONE WAS 
ALLOWED TO GO INTO THE CELLAR HE 
WENT THERE ALMOST EVERY DAY L. 
THOUGHT IT WAS STRANGE BUT I DID 
NOT FIND IT SUSPICIOUS 
DID YOU 
EVER SEE ANYONE ELSE GOING DOWN TO 
THE SELLER 
HE DIDN'T GET MANY 
VISITORS SOMETIMES RELATIVES OR 
FRIENDS WOULD COME TO THE HOUSE 
ONE TIME HE INTRODUCED ME TO 
SOMEONE ELSE HE SAID HE WAS A 
PLUMBER AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO 
DOWN INTO THE CELLAR 
IN THE TWELVE 
YEARS HE LIVED IN THAT HOUSE DID 
YOU EVER NOTICE ANYTHING 
SUSPICIOUS YOU LIVED IN THAT 
HOUSE 
I HEARD NOISES BELOW MY ROOM HOUSE BANGING BASHING KNOCKING NOISES 
ONCE I ASK WHAT IT WAS AND HE SAID 
IT WAS COMING FROM THE GAS HEATING 
BELOW I ASKED ONE OF THE OTHER 
LODGERS SAID SHE SAW HIM TAKING 
FOOD INTO THE CELLAR LATE AT NIGHT 
I ASSUMED HE WAS STORING FOOD 
ALFRED DUBANOVSKY HAD ONE THING IN 
COMMON WITH JOSEF FRITZL HE TOO 
HAD BEEN ON HOLIDAY TO THAILAND IT 
GAVE LODGER AND LANDLORDS 
SOMETHING TO CHAT ABOUT LODGER 
AND LANDLORD 
AFTER I CAME BACK 
FROM HOLIDAY WE TALKED ABOUT 
EVERYTHING I TOLD HIM HOW EASY IT 
WAS TO GET DRUGS IN THAILAND HE 
REPLIED WE MUST PROTECT OUR 
CHILDREN THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO 
LOCK THEM AWAY 
ALFRED DUBANOVSKY 
MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE LAST YEAR 
BUT ONE PHRASE FROM JOSEF FRITZL 
HAS STUCK IN HIS MIND HE SAYS THAT 
HE BOASTED THAT HIS HOUSE WOULD GO 
DOWN IN HISTORY 
COMING UP DID RANGERS DO ENOUGH 
AGAINST FIORENTINA TO GET TO THEIR 
FIRST EUROPEAN FINAL FOR MORE THAN 
THIRTY YEARS 
LOCAL PRODUCE IS BECOMING MORE AND 
MORE A SELLING POINT IN PUBS AND 
RESTAURANTS AROUND BRITAIN MANY 
CLAIM TO OFFER BRITISH BEEF SOURCED 
IN THE REGION AN INVESTIGATION FOR 
THIS PROGRAMME HAS DISCOVERED THAT 
IN SOME CASES THE BEEF WAS NOT 
LOCAL IN FACT IT WAS NOT EVEN 
BRITISH JON KAY CHECKED BEEF IN FORTY 
PUBS AND RESTAURANTS ACROSS THE 
SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND ONE IN FIVE 
DISHES FAILED THE TEST 
CELEBRATING THE VERY BEST OF LOCAL 
FOOD AT THIS FESTIVAL IN EXETER 
SHOPPERS CAN BUY DIRECT FROM THE 
FARM HERE THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHERE 
THE PRODUCE HAS COME FROM BUT WHAT 
ABOUT WHEN THEY ARE EATING OUT IF 
YOU WERE TO BUY SOMETHING DESCRIBED 
AS A LOCAL STATE IN A PUB OR 
RESTAURANT HOW FAR WOULD YOU 
EXPECT THE MEAT TO HAVE TROUBLED 
TRAVELLED 
TWENTY MILES NO MORE TRAVELLED ESPECIALLY IN DEVON WHERE THERE ARE 
SO MANY FARMS 
WE DECIDED TO FIND 
OUT WE WENT UNDERCOVER AND VISITED 
FORTY PUBS AND RESTAURANTS ACROSS THE 
SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND ALL OF THEM 
CLAIMING TO SELL LOCAL BEEF WE 
TOOK A SAMPLE IN EACH ONE BRAD 
PITT AND SENT IT OFF FOR SCIENTIFIC 
ANALYSIS PUT IT IN A BAG AND 
SENT IT OFF FOR SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS 
THE D. N. A. OF EACH SAMPLE WAS KNOCKED 
OUT TO ESTABLISH WHAT SPECIES OF 
CATTLE IT CAME FROM THEY FOUND 
THAT EIGHT OF THE FORTY SAMPLES CAME 
FROM SPECIES THAT ACTUALLY EXIST 
ABROAD SO TWENTY PER CENT OF OUR SUPPOSEDLY 
LOCAL STATE AND BURGERS WERE IN 
FACT FALLEN 
THE MEAT MAY WELL HAVE 
ORIGINATED IN BRAZIL 
FORUM IT IT IS CERTAINLY NOT LOCAL 
IT IN A 
FIFTH OF OUR RESTAURANTS WHEN WE 
THOUGHT WE WERE BUYING BRITISH BEEF 
WE WERE ACTUALLY EATING THIS 
CATTLE WHICH ONLY LIVE IN DRY AND 
ARID PARTS OF THE WORLD 
I THINK 
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS PEOPLE SHOULD BE 
MADE AWARE 
IT'S DISGRACEFUL 
THAT'S ALMOST TANTAMOUNT TO FRAUD 
ISN'T IT 
IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY A 
RESTAURANT MIGHT BE TEMPTED THEY 
CAN BUY FOREIGN MEAT CHEAPLY AND 
SELL IT ON AT A PREMIUM AS LOCAL 
BRITISH BEEF AND MOST OF US WOULD 
NOT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE 
THESE HAVE 
BEEN BORN RAISED AND RIAD ON THIS 
FARM 
BUT FARMERS LIKE CHILE SAY FARM THERE IS A REAL DIFFERENCE LIKE 
JULIAN THEY CLAIM SOME IMPORTED 
MEAT IS POOR QUALITY AND COMES FROM 
AREAS OF THE WORLD WITH LOWER 
STANDARDS OF ANIMAL WELFARE AND 
HYGIENE 
IT'S A GREAT BIG ONE PURE HYGIENE EXPLOITATION OF CONSUMER DEMAND FOR 
LOCAL FOOD A GREAT BIG CORNER 
UNTIL THERE IS A TRIAL THE 
SITUATION IS ONLY GOING TO GET 
WORSE BETRAYAL 
THE LAW SAYS 
BUTCHERS MUST BE ABLE TO PROVE 
WHERE MEADE HAS COME FROM FARMERS 
SAY RESTAURANTS SHOULD HAVE TO DO 
THE SAME MEAT 
THERE IS A LEGAL LOOPHOLE WHICH MAY 
EXPLAIN WHY SO MANY SAMPLES TURNED 
OUT TO BE FOREIGN THIS STEAK PIE 
THE MEAT CAME FROM BRAZIL SIX THOUSAND 
MILES AWAY BUT BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN 
PROCESSED IN THIS COUNTRY IT CAN 
ENTIRELY LEGALLY BE DESCRIBED ON A 
RESTAURANT MENU AS A BRITISH OR 
EVEN LOCAL PRODUCT BEFORE WE BEGAN 
THIS INVESTIGATION THE GOVERNMENT 
SAID IT WAS NOT AWARE OF A 
WIDESPREAD PROBLEM VERY FEW 
BUSINESSES HAVE EVER BEEN 
PROSECUTED BUT TONIGHT THE 
GOVERNMENT'S FOOD WATCHDOG SAID IT 
IS DISAPPOINTED WITH OUR FINDINGS 
AND SAYS THE LAW DOES NEED TO BE 
EXAMINED 
THE LABELLING REGULATIONS EXAMINED ARE REALLY COMPLICATED ESPECIALLY 
FOR PRE PACKED PRE PREPARED FOOD 
THIS IS AN AREA WE COULD PROVIDE 
SOME MORE INFORMATION TO CONSUMERS 
TO HELP THEM MAKE THE CHOICES THAT 
THEY WANT TO 
TRADING STANDARDS SAY THERE NEEDS 
TO BE NEW LEGAL DEFINITION OF 
WHAT LOCAL REALLY MEANS ALTHOUGH 
OUR INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT 
IN THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND THEY 
SAY THEY DON'T BELIEVE THE 
SITUATION HERE IS UNIQUE 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS SAID THE 
WORST OF THE CREDIT CRISIS MAY BE 
OVER BUT IT SAYS COMMERCIAL 
LENDERS MAY BE HINDERING ECONOMIC 
RECOVERY BY BEING TOO CAUTIOUS 
ABOUT APPROVING NEW LOANS EVEN TO 
BORROWERS WITH GOOD CREDIT RATING 
OUR ECONOMIC EDITOR IS HERE TO 
EXPLAIN EXPLAIN THE BANK OF ENGLAND THINKS THE 
BANKS ARE BEING TOO GLOOMY ABOUT 
THE SQUEEZE IN THEIR PROFITS FROM 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH AS RESULT 
THEY MAY BE MAKING THINGS TIGHTER 
FOR ALL OF US JUST YEAR AGO ITS 
FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT WAS 
WARNING TO BANKS THEY WERE BEING 
TOO RECKLESS BUT NOW AFTER EIGHT 
MONTHS OF CREDIT CRUNCH IT RECKONS 
THEY HAVE GONE TOO FAR THE OTHER 
WAY TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF U. S. SUB 
PRIME HOUSING THE FINANCIAL 
MARKETS SAY THE LOSSES FROM THESE 
LOANS COULD BE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
BILLION THE REPORT SAYS THE ACTUAL 
LOSSES WILL BE CLOSER TO EIGHTY SIX 
BILLION IF THAT THE DIFFERENCE 
MATTERS BECAUSE THE LARGER THE 
BANK THINKS THE LOSSES ARE THE 
MORE THEY WILL CLING ON TO THEIR 
CASH RATHER THAN LEND IT TO US THE THE WRITE DOWNS OF THESE SUB PRIME 
MORTGAGES THE REDUCTION IN VALUE 
THAT THE BANKS HAVE ASSUMED MAY 
HAVE GONE TOO FAR IN FACT THE 
EVENTUAL LOSSES COULD BE SOMEWHAT 
LOWER THAN THE BANKS ARE NOW 
THINKING THEREFORE THE BANKS MAY 
BE BEING A BIT TOO CAUTIOUS IN 
TERMS OF EXTENDING LOANS HOW HOW PESSIMISTIC ARE THEY THE MARKET 
VALUE OF SOME OF THE SUB PRIME 
ASSETS IS NOW SO LOW THAT THEY ARE 
ASSUMING THREE QUARTERS OF THOSE 
MORTGAGES WILL GO INTO DEFAULT AND 
WHEN THE BANKS SELL THE HOUSES THEY 
WILL ONLY GET HALF OF WHAT THEY 
LEND THAT IS PRETTY HARD TO 
BELIEVE SOONER OR LATER THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND THINKS THE CITY WILL SEE 
SENSE AND THE WORST OF THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH WILL BE OVER WE JUST HAVE 
TO HOPE THAT THE BLOOM DOES NOT DO 
TOO MUCH HARM TO THE REAL ECONOMY 
IN THE MEANTIME THE GLOOM 
NINE TOURISTS HAVE BEEN KILLED 
AFTER A BUS OVERTURNED ON A DESERT 
ROAD IN EGYPT EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES 
SAY FOUR BRITISH TOURISTS WERE 
AMONG THIRTY PEOPLE INJURED THE BUS 
WAS TRAVELLING FROM THE RED SEA 
RESORT SHARM EL SHEIKH TO CAIRO 
THE LEADER OF AN MILITANT ISLAMIC 
GROUP WAS KILLED BY AMERICAN AIR 
STRIKES IN SMALYAFPLT THERE'S NEW 
EVIDENCE THAT NOT ONLY IS AL QAEDA 
USING THE COUNTRY AS A BASE BUT 
THAT BRITISH MILITANTS ARE 
TRAVELLING THERE TO TRAIN 
SMALYAFPLT SMALYAFPLT FOR YEARS SOMALIA HAS BEEN ENGULFED 
IN A BRUTAL VIOLENT CIVIL WAR 
TODAY THE U. S. INTERVENED WITH A 
DRAMATIC AIRSTRIKE TO TAKE OUT A 
MAN IT BELIEVED WAS A SERIOUS 
THREAT THREAT SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE 
TARGET OF THE STRIKE HE'S CALLED 
ADEN HASHI AYRO A TOP MILITARY 
COMMANDER FOR THE AL SHABAB MILITIA 
SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS THE LEADER 
OF AL AL QAEDA IN SOMALIA HE 
LINKED THE LOCAL MILITIA TO AL 
QAEDA'S LEADERSHIP IN PAKISTAN 
SPEAKING TO THE B. B. C. TODAY A 
SPOKESMAN FOR THE AL SHABAB 
PROMISED REVENGE HE SAID THE 
INCIDENT WOULD ENDANGER U. S. 
INTERESTS IN THE REGION AND THOSE 
OF GOVERNMENTS WHO SUPPORT THE U. S. 
HE SAID AMERICANS AND THEIR ALLIES 
WOULD NOT BE SAFE 
SO HOW DID THE U. S. STRIKE ITS 
TARGET TARGET THE ORDER WAS GIVEN THOUSANDS OF 
MILES AWAY AT CENTRAL COMMAND IN 
TAMPA FLORIDA THEY TRACKED HIM 
WITH SATELLITES INFORMERS AND 
INTERCEPTED CALLS THEY SENT 
DETAILS OF HIS LOCATION TO A U. S. 
VESSEL OFF THE SOMALI COAST AT THREE A M. 
IT'S THOUGHT UP TO FOUR TOMAHAWK 
CRUISE MISSILES WERE FIRED FROM THE 
VESSEL THEY HEADED FOR A SINGLE 
ZRB STOREY COMPOUND AND THE 
BUILDING WAS FLATTENED BUT HOW 
MUCH DIFFERENCE WILL HIS DEATH 
MAKE 
THIS DEATH DOES NOT MEAN MUCH MAKE BECAUSE IT'S ONE BAD APPLE IN A 
SITUATION WHERE CHAOS AND 
INSTABILITY HAVE BEEN THE RULE FOR 
TWENTY YEARS SO IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE 
THIS PERSON WAS THE MAIN CAUSE OF 
THAT IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HIS 
DEATH WILL BE THE END TO THAT 
ISLAMIC MILITANTS BRIEFLY RAN 
SOMALIA UNTIL THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN 
ETHOPIAN TROOPS BACKED BY THE U. S. 
BUT THERE ARE WIDER SECURITY 
CONCERNS SOMALIA'S INSTABILITY 
POSES A REAL THREAT THE CHAOS HAS 
BEEN A DRAW FOR AL QAEDA SPEAKING A 
BASE AND FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO 
FIGHT FOR THE ISLAMIC MILITANTS 
INCLUDING SOME BRITONS AT PRESENT 
SECURITY SOURCES BELIEVE DOZENS 
RATHER THAN HUNDREDS ARE TRAVELLING 
FROM THE U. K. TO FIGHT AND TRAIN IN 
SOMALIA SOMALIA THAT COULD GROW AND THE COUNTRY 
COULD BECOME A STAGING GROUND FOR 
ATTACKS INCLUDING AGAINST BRITAIN 
THIS MORNING'S MISSILE STRIKE MAY 
HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ELIMINATING ONE 
SENIOR COMMANDER BUT THAT'S 
UNLIKELY TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT ON 
SOMALIA'S UNDERLYING FRAGILITY AND 
THE DANGERS THAT IT MAY POSE 
IN FOOTBALL RANGERS HAVE BEEN 
PLAYING THE ITALIAN SIDE FIORENTINA 
TONIGHT FOR PLACE IN THE UEFA CUP 
FINAL THE SCOTTISH CLUB WERE 
HOPING TO REACH THEIR FIRST 
EUROPEAN FINAL IN THIRTY SIX YEARSANDY 
SWISS REPORTS 
IF YOU CAN REMEMBER RANGERS' LAST 
EUROPEAN SUCCESS YOU MUST HAVE 
PRETTY DECENT MEMORY 
THAT NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO CUP WINNERS CUP VICTORY 
SPARKED QUITE A CELEBRATION THIRTY SIX 
YEARS ON THEIR FANS IN FLORENCE 
WERE HOPING FOR ANOTHER NIGHT TO 
SAVOUR SAVOUR SO COULD RANGERS AT LAST GET TO 
ANOTHER EUROPEAN FINAL 
WELL IN A RATHER TWITCHY FIRST 
HALF IT WAS RANGERS THAT LOOKED THE 
TWITCHIER BUT FIORENTINA COULDN'T 
MAKE THEM PAY AND WALTER SMITH'S 
SIDE HELD 
ON TO THE BREAK 
AFTER IT THEY CONTINUED TO 
FRUSTRATE THE ITALIANS 
MUTU'S SHOT COURAGEOUSLY SAVED AS 
THE CLOCK TICKED DOWN SO RANGERS 
GAINED IN CONFIDENCE 
BUT DESPITE THEIR BEST EFFORTS 
STILL NO GOALS 
COME EXTRA TIME THOUGH THEY WERE 
DOWN TO TEN MEN DANIEL COUSIN WITH 
ONLY HIMSELF TO BLAME FOR HIS RED 
CARD HIS MANAGER COULD SCARCELY 
BELIEVE IT DESPITE THAT RANGERS 
NEARLY SNATCHED IT AT THE END BUT 
THEY DIDN'T AND A PENALTY SHOOT OUT 
BECKONED AN EARLY MISS DIDN'T BODE 
WELL FOR RANGERS IT'S A NERVE 
RACKING END TO HEROIC PERFORMANCE 
IN THE PAST FEW SECONDS RANGERS 
HAVE WON THAT PENALTY SHOOT OUT 
WITH THIS GOAL AND ARE THROUGH 
TO THE UEFA CUP FINAL
