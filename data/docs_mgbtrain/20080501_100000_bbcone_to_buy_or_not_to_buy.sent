SITTING PROUDLY ON THE M. FOUR WELL WITHIN A COMMUTING DISTANCE OF LONDON 
READING BOASTS NEARLY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT EMPLOYMENT RATE 
AND THAT'S NO SURPRISE AS THIS METROPOLIS IS AT THE CENTRE OF THE U. K.'S SILICON VALLEY 
THAT'S NOT BAD FOR A TOWN THAT WAS FAMOUS FOR BEER SEEDS AND BISCUITS 
BUT THESE DAYS IT PREFERS BUSINESS PARKS AND HI TECH EMPLOYERS 
TODAY THE RED BRICK VICTORIAN HOUSES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SIT DEFIANTLY NEXT TO THE NEW 
BUT WHATEVER THE DATE OF BUILD IT WILL COST YOU 
READING HOUSE PRICES ARE ON A PAR WITH LONDON AND JUST KEEP ON CLIMBING 
TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND ISN'T A KING'S RANSOM AROUND HERE 
AND IT WON'T NECESSARILY GET THE HOUSE OF YOUR DREAMS BUT WE WILL NOT BE DEFEATED 
BUT AROUND THE COUNTRY IT COULD BUY YOU A LOT MORE FOR YOUR MONEY 
HOW ABOUT A DETACHED BUNGALOW IN PAIGNTON DEVON 
STUNNING SEA VIEWS THREE DOUBLE BEDROOMS GARDENS AND PARKING 
I LOVE THAT PRICE SAY IT AGAIN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND 
OR PERHAPS YOU'LL PREFER A BRAND NEW LUXURY PENTHOUSE IN PETERBOROUGH 
TWO BEDS LUXURY FIXTURES AND FITTINGS WOODEN FLOORS AND A LIFT 
MAYBE YOU'D PREFER THIS TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT NEAR CHESTER 
THIS STABLE CONVERSION BOASTS MODERN LIVING ACCOMMODATION

THEY PROBABLY WON'T BE STAYING YEAH THAT'S PERIOD CHARM I THINK ABSOLUTELY 
THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH YOUR PROPERTY AND MINE HASN'T OFFERED THEM PERIOD CHARM M. M. M. 
WE'VE SURPRISED THEM YEAH 
WHAT D'YOU THINK OF THE VIEW YEAH LOTS OF HOUSES 
OH LOOK YEAH 
THEY'RE IGNORING YOU KRISTIAN THEY'RE IGNORING ME YOU MUST BE USED TO IT 
NOT MY FAVOURITE PART DEFINITELY NOT BUT 
NEVER MIND 
BLANKED HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED THAT WHEN YOU GO OUT 
O. K. SO THIS IS LIKE THE MAIN THIS REALLY IS THE MAIN BEDROOM I'M NOT LOVING THAT AT ALL 
I'D HAVE TO RIP ALL OF THAT OUT EVEN THOUGH IT'S BIG IT DOESN'T HAVE IT FEELS OLD DOESN'T IT IT DOES 
I WONDER WHY IT FEELS OLD COULD IT BE SEVENTY SIX YEARS AHH 
IT'S NOT CRYING OUT FOR ME TO LIVE IN IT 
SHALL WE RUN IN FULL OF ENTHUSIASM AND TRY AND EXCITE THEM ABOUT THIS PROPERTY LET'S TRY YEAH 
DOM WHAT YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME ALL RIGHT YEAH 
SO HERE WE ARE DOWNSTAIRS IN THE WILD ELEMENT OF THE WILD CARD 
IT WAS A BIT OF A SURPRISE WASN'T IT VERY MUCH SO KRISTIAN 
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT OF A WEIRD CARD A WEIRD CARD 
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE THAT ELEMENT EVERY WEEK IT'S A POSSIBILITY I LIKE THAT IT'S NOT THAT WEIRD 
BECAUSE YOU SURE YOU'VE GOT A SELF CONTAINED UNIT O. K. 
SO YOU COULD RENT THIS OUT YEAH 
BECAUSE IT HAS SEPARATE UTILITIES BILLS WILL COME IN SEPARATELY 
YOU GET A TENANT IN YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT 
RENTING HERE I THINK WHAT FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY A MONTH YEAH QUITE POSSIBLY EXTRA SPENDING MONEY 
IF YOU DON'T WANT THE INCONVENIENCE OF HAVING A TENANT I DON'T THINK WE'D WANT SOMEONE ELSE IN OUR HOUSE 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S BELOW THE HOUSE I'M NOT SURE THAT'S AN OPTION IF YOU'RE NOT GOING WITH THAT 
THEN THIS HAS TO BE YOUR SPACE DEFINITELY THIS HAS TO BE YOUR SPACE YES 
AS A GRAPHIC DESIGN EMPORIUM YEAH 
I CAN I CAN SEE THE BENEFITS OF THAT BUT I'M STILL NOT FEELING IT KRISTIAN 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO MAKE YOU HAPPY I'M OFFERING YOU FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY A MONTH 
OR YOUR OWN GRAPHIC DESIGN STUDIO I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I CAN DO 
WELL PROBABLY A DIFFERENT HOUSE I THINK TO BE HONEST WITH YOU YEAH 
EM WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE PRICE 
JO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOKED AT MY HOUSE YEAH YOU AND KRISTIAN SPOKE ABOUT THE GARDEN 
YEAH HE CONVINCED YOU THAT YOU DIDN'T LIKE ME I KNOW IT WAS VERY MEAN OF HIM WASN'T IT 
I'M GONNA BE HONEST NOW YEAH I DIDN'T ACTUALLY FIND THIS ONE 
KRISTIAN FOUND IT AND HE TALKED ME INTO THIS ONE SAYING IT'S BRILLIANT YEAH YEAH IT WAS HIM 
DO WE NOT HAVE TO LIKE KRISTIAN NOW YOU MAKE YOUR OWN MIND UP YOU'RE A BIG GIRL NOW 
I CERTAINLY AM 
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THIS HOUSE FOR ITS GOODNESS NO 
I'VE NOT BEEN LOOKING IN THE RIGHT PLACES 
WHAT ABOUT THE SELF CONTAINED FLAT DOWNSTAIRS 
JUST A BIT ODD REALLY I WANT TO SEE STEVE I DON'T WANT HIM HIDDEN AWAY 
WELL YOU CAN DO CAN I 
ALSO GREAT FOR THE IN LAWS WHEN YOU DON'T WANNA SEE THEM 
YEAH YEAH I'VE DONE SOME HOMEWORK O. K. 
ALL THESE HOUSES ALONG THIS ROAD ALL HAVE THIS GROUND FLOOR LEVEL WHICH ARE SELF CONTAINED FLATS 
YEAH BUT QUITE A FEW OF THEM 
HAVE THEM SELF CONTAINED OTHERS DON'T OTHERS OPEN UP SEE THIS CUPBOARD YEAH YEAH 
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT NOW BUT IF YOU REMOVE THIS FREEZER YEAH 
YOU CAN OPEN THIS UP AND YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH HEAD HEIGHT TO PUT A COMPLETE STAIRCASE IN 
AND GO DOWNSTAIRS O. K. TO MAKE IT PART OF THE BUILDING AS OPPOSED TO A SELF CONTAINED FLAT 
THAT WOULD BE BETTER WOULDN'T IT YES 
DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE HOUSE WELL THAT'S A GREAT IDEA 
BUT I'M STILL NOT LOVING THE HOUSE 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY EVERYTHING BEFORE THE BUT IS BOUGHT O. K. 
IT'S NOT FOR YOU IS IT CERTAINLY NOT DOM SORRY BEST PRICE 
RIGHT COME ON DOWN LET'S FIND OUT IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT O. K.

SO I'LL LET YOU GO ACTUALLY IT'S MY DECISION YOU GO FIRST THIS TIME 
SORRY ABOUT THAT DOM NO WORRIES IT'S THE TEACHER IN ME 
I THINK IT'S BELOW THE STAMP DUTY AND I THINK IT'S TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE O. K. 
I THINK IT'S ABOVE THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY STAMP DUTY O. K. COS THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE HERE 
SO I'M GONNA SAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE ON THIS ONE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE O. K. 
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT YEAH I THINK I'M SURE ABOUT THAT KRISTIAN 
MILES OUT REALLY YOU ARE MILES OUT OH DEAR DOES THAT MEAN I'M MILES OUT

FANTASTIC BYE BYE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN FROM HERE ON IN DOM 
OH RIGHT OH WHICH ONE WOULD YOU GO FOR 
H. M. M. 
HERE'S A QUICK REMINDER 
OH COME ON WILL IT BE PROPERTY ONE MY CHOICE HOW COULD THEY SAY NO 
A SIXTEEN FOOT CONSERVATORY A SEVENTEEN FOOT LOUNGE THREE BEDROOMS 
WRITE A CHEQUE FOR THE ASKING PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY THANK YOU 
I THINK MY BARELY USED THREE BED HOUSE WITH ELECTRONIC GATES TO KEEP UNDESIRABLES OUT LIKE YOU 
WILL GIVE YOUR HOUSE A RUN FOR ITS MONEY 
MINE'S PRICED AT 
DON'T FORGET THE WILDCARD OUR JOINT CHOICE 
THAT DECEPTIVE LOOKING SEMI IN THE CENTRE OF TOWN WITH A HIDDEN FLAT DOWNSTAIRS ALL FOR 
IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION H. M. M. 
PROPERTY NUMBER ONE WHAT CAN YOU SAY IT'S GORGEOUS 
REALLY LIKED IT A NICE FEEL INSIDE 
NICE HALLWAY 
SPACIOUS THROUGH THE KITCHEN AND DINER AND CONSERVATORY 
LOUNGE WAS A GOOD SIZE WELL DECORATED 
I CAN REALLY SEE OURSELVES IN THIS HOUSE I COULD TOO 
PROPERTY TWO WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT ONE 
BIT LIKE A BOX I COULD SEE US IN THERE 
THAT M. FOUR CORRIDOR THAT DID IT FOR ME LOCATION NOT GREAT 
INSIDE IT DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD FEEL THE SPACE WASN'T GREAT 
THE USE OF THE SPACE WAS ODD YEP 
PROPERTY THREE 
WASN'T SURE ABOUT IT FROM THE OUTSIDE AND THE AREA WASN'T GREAT 
NO IT DID HAVE A NICE GARDEN AND A NICE APPLE TREE 
TOO MANY STRANGE THINGS GOING ON IT WAS MORE A WEIRD CARD THAN A WILDCARD 
WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE THEN 
TAKING EVERYTHING INTO ACCOUNT IT HAS TO BE PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
PROPERTY ONE I AGREE 
I'M ALMOST SHOCKED AT MY ABILITIES BECAUSE DID I NOT PREDICT THAT YOU'D BE COMING BACK HERE TO MY CHOICE 
YOU'RE LIKE A FORTY FIVE LIKE AN OLD RECORD 
HE'S BITTER ISN'T HE 
LET HIM HAVE HIS LITTLE TANTRUM 
HERE WE ARE BACK AT THIS PROPERTY 
WHY I KNOW WHY BUT TELL ME ANYWAY 
IT TICKS ALL THE BOXES KRISTIAN 
IT'S CLOSE TO THE STATION STEVE CAN GET TO WORK 
STEVE'S CATERED FOR HE'S GOT HIS LODGE THE LODGE IS A BIG WINNER NO EN SUITE 
WONDERFUL KITCHEN THAT'S NOT A MAJOR PROBLEM 
NO EN SUITE 
NO EN SUITE BUT DOWNSTAIRS TOILET MORE THAN WE'VE GOT NOW 
THAT'S MORE THAN WE'VE GOT NOW 
YOU'RE HAPPY WE ARE 
INTERESTING 
WE'VE HAD OUR SURVEYOR LOOK AT THIS HOUSE 
BEAR IN MIND IT'S NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY FINE 
IF YOU WANT TO BUY THIS HOUSE WE RECOMMEND YOU GET YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT ONE 
THERE'S A COUPLE OF FAULTS ONE OF THEM FAIRLY MAJOR 
IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS THAT FIFTEEN MILLIMETRE COPPER PIPE THERE 
THAT'S A SHORTCUT THAT SOMEONE'S TAKEN TO SUPPLY GAS TO THE FIRE IN THE FRONT ROOM 
IDEALLY YOU CAN DO IT THAT WAY BUT YOU NEED A TWENTY TWO MILLIMETRE PIPE FIXED TO THE WALL 
THAT'S LOOSE IT'S THE WRONG DIAMETER 
OR HAVE IT CONNECTED CORRECTLY UNDERNEATH THE FLOORBOARDS 
IT'S A BIT OF AN EYESORE IT IS QUITE SERIOUS DO LOOK AT IT 
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE SORTED QUITE EASILY EASILY SORTED YES 
BUT IT NEEDS SORTING STRAIGHTAWAY RIGHT 
A LONG TERM GROWER IN ALL SENSES OF THE WORD IS THE IVY ON THE WALL 
IT'S VERY PRETTY SOFTENS THE BRICKWORK 
YOU MUST JUST KEEP AN EYE ON IT COS A PLANT LIKE THAT CAN BE INVASIVE 
IT CAN LONG TERM DAMAGE CEMENT WORK 
O. K. THE POINTING DON'T LET IT TAKE OVER 
TRIM IT BACK MAKE SURE IT'S NOT DAMAGING CEMENT WORK AT ALL 
THAT'S IT THAT'S IT 
THAT'S BRILLIANT WE CAN HANDLE THAT 
DOM SHALL WE SEND THEM IN FOR THE TEST DRIVE 
OFF YOU GO 
LET'S GO 
IT HASN'T STEVE LONG TO GET DRAWN INTO THAT LODGE 
INSPIRATION SEEMS TO HAVE COME QUITE QUICKLY 
I WONDER WHAT HE'S DOING IT'S HARDLY HIS TAX RETURNS EINSTEIN
