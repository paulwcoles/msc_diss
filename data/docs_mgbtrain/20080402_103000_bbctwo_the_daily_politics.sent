THE COMMONS 
THE GOVERNMENT UNVEILS NEW PLANS TO 
HELP HOUSEHOLDERS CUT THEIR FUEL 
BILLS BUT WE HAVE BEEN ROAD 
TESTING JUST HOW MANY GOVERNMENT 
SCHEMES IT TAKES TO GET US TO 
CHANGE OUR LIGHT

LATER IN THE PROGRAMME 
YES IT IS THE NINETY MINUTE WEDNESDAY 
EXTRAVAGANZA TODAY WITH US TODAY 
TWO POLITICIANS AT THE TOP OF THEIR 
GAME FIDDLERS BOTH KEN CLARKE AND 
THE MINISTER IN CHARGE OF OUR 
POLICE TONY MCNULTY 
NO FLAK JACKET HERE TODAY 
THERE IS IS A TOP TEAM TO HELP US 
THROUGH A BUSY MORNING ON THE DAILY 
POLITICS POLITICS LET'S TURN TO THIS DEVELOPING 
SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE 
WHILE THE COUNTRY'S ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION IT HASN'T OFFICIALLY 
GIVEN THE RESULTS OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS THERE IS A 
STATE RUN NEWSPAPER IT IS CALLED 
THE HERALD AND IT IS IT IS 
REPORTING THAT NEITHER ROBERT 
MUGABE NOR MORGAN TSVANGIRAI THE 
MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY HAS WON AN 
OVERALL MAJORITY IT SUGGESTS THAT 
A PRESIDENTIAL RUN OFF A SECOND 
ELECTION HAVE TO BE HELD IN 
THE NEXT THREE WEEKS 
SOME PEOPLE SMELL A RAT HERE IS 
ROBERT MUGABE MANOEUVRING FOR 
ANOTHER CONTEST A SECOND ONE IN 
WHICH HE MAY FIX IT THAT HE WOULD 
WIN THIS DEVELOPMENT CAME AFTER 
AFTER RUMOURS LAST NIGHT THAT 
TALKS WERE GOING ON BETWEEN THE TWO 
SIDES TWO ARRANGE A TRANSITION OF 
POWER THAT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE 
TRUE THE RUMOURS DON'T SOUND AS IF 
THEY HAVE BEEN TRUE THIS MORNING 
THE COUNTRY REMAINS IN A TENSE 
LIMBO LIMBO TONY MCNULTY THE FOREIGN SECRETARY 
WILL MAKE A STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE 
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS AFTER PMQS 
WHAT'S THE BRITISH MESSAGE HERE AND 
DO YOU SEE IT MATTER DO WE HAVE 
ANYTHING USEFUL TO SAY 
I THINK 
WHAT WE CAN USEFULLY SAY WE NEED 
THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION TO COME 
OUT WITH THE RESULTS AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE POSSIBLE DO WE TRUST THE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION 
I THINK WE HAVE TO GO COMMISSION THROUGH THAT PROCESS TO BEGIN WITH 
WE HAVE TO GET TO THE END GAME AS 
YOU WOULD WITH ANY ANY ELECTION AND 
WORK BACKWARDS FOR THAT IT IS NOT 
FOR US TO INTERFERE 
NO NO BUT IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT NOT 
LEAST BECAUSE OF WHAT WENT ON IN 
KENYA WHERE THERE WAS DISPUTE OVER 
RESULTS THAT THERE IS THE FIRST 
CLARITY OF THE COMMISSION REPORTING 
AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY 
WE DON'T HAVE ANY PURCHASE IN 
ZIMBABWE WE HAVE ZERO RELATIONS 
WITH THEM NOW WE HAVE NO POWER TO 
BRING TO BEAR ON THIS EXCEPT MAYBE 
TO PUSH SOUTH AFRICA TO DO 
SOMETHING 
I WAS GOING TO SAY OUR SOMETHING PURCHASE IS PART OF THE WIDER 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
PARTICULARLY SOUTH AFRICA AND SOME 
OF THE OTHER SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONS 
BUT IN THE BROADER CONTEXT TOO BUT 
WE CAN'T ENDURE THIS DRIP DRIP 
DRIP OF RESULTS 
WE NEED THE COMMISSION TO REPORT AT 
THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY 
KEN CLARKE AREN'T WE RIGHT TO SMELL 
A RAT HERE IS THERE ANYTHING IN 
ROBERT MUGABE'S MAKE UP THAT WOULD 
MAKE US THINK THAT HE IS GOING TO 
SAY I LOST MORGAN TSVANGIRAI COME 
ON THE JOB IS YOURS SOMETHING SOMETHING CURIOUS IS HAPPENING L. KNOW NO 
MORE ABOUT IT THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN 
THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA L. DOUBT 
WHETHER OUR FOREIGN SECRETARY DOES 
EITHER WE ARE OBSERVERS WANTING TO 
SEE ZIMBABWE COME BACK TO NORM 
MALLITY IF IF ROBERT MUGABE WON 
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN CELEBRATING IT 
OH IT IS CLEAR HE HASN'T WON 
THEY ARE PARALYSED INTO INACTIVITY 
I BELIEVE THE RUMOURS THAT THERE 
ARE INTERNAL MEETINGS GOING ON 
WITHIN THE RULING PARTY BECAUSE THE 
HARD MEN WANT TO SEE IT OUT AND THE 
SOFT MEN ARE SAYING WE HAVE GOT TO 
GET OUT 
AND THE ARMY IS ALWAYS IN 
AFRICA AFRICA THE ARMY CHIEFS SAY THEY ARE NOT 
GOING TO OBEY MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND 
THEY KNOW THEY HAVE HALF THEIR 
FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN STARVING SO 
I THINK IF YOU LOOK BACK TO THE 
SOVIET UNION PARALYSED INACTIVITY 
WAS THE FIRST REACTION OF THE EAST 
GERMANS WHILST THEIR SOLDIERS STOOD 
ON THE WALL AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO 
DO PARALYSING INACTIVITY IS WHAT 
ROBERT MUGABE IS IS SHOWING 
WHEN THINGS GO THEY GO AT SPEED 
AND WHETHER IT IS WITH CONTROL OR 
DISASTER DISASTER IF THERE ARE ANY BREAKING 
DEVELOPMENTS COMING FROM ZIMBABWE 
WE WILL BRING IT LIVE TO YOU IN THE 
NEXT NINETY MINUTES ON THE DAILY 
POLITICS POLITICS JUST WHEN HE THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE TO 
OPEN A NEWSPAPER MICHAEL MARTIN 
FOUND HIMSELF THE SUBJECT OF 
HEADLINES ABOUT HIS EXPENSES THIS 
MORNING AFTER THE PAPERS REVEALED 
AT THE WEEKEND THAT OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND 
OF PUBLIC MONEY HAS BEEN PENT ON 
HIS OFFICIAL RESIDENCE IT WAS 
ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT THE 
PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONER FOR 
STANDARDS IS TO INVESTIGATE REPORTS 
THAT MR. MARTIN'S WIFE SPENT ABOUT 
FOUR THOUSAND OF PUBLIC MONEY ON TAXIS FOR 
SHOPPING TRIPS WILL IT BE THE 
TAXIS THAT BRING DOWN THE SPEAKER 
TONY MCNULTY MICHAEL MARTIN IS 
BEING INVESTIGATED FOR HIS EXPENSES 
AT A TIME WHEN HE IS CHAIRING A 
COMMITTEE THAT'S LOOKING INTO THE 
REFORM OF M. P.'S EXPENSES HOW CAN 
THAT POSSIBLY WORK 
THAT WAS AN AWFUL PUN 
WE'RE FAMOUS FOR THEM 
THE HOUSE AUTHORITIES UNDER MICHAEL 
THE MEMBERS THE ESTIMATES 
COMMITTEE HAVE TO DO THEIR JOB AND 
DO THEIR JOB SWIFTLY 
CAN HE CARRY ON CHAIRING IT I I THINK HE CAN L. WOULD DISMISS THE 
STUFF ABOUT THE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND THESE ARE 
STATE FACILITIES THEY ARE NOT 
MICHAEL TARTING UP HIS OWN 
ACCOMMODATION M. 
DOES I REALLY NEED TO SPEND THAT 
MUCH 
YOU HAVE PROBABLY BEEN INSIDE MUCH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DOING THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS UP IS A SERIOUS 
BUSINESS IT ALMOST HARKS BACK TO 
DERRY IRVINE AND THE SIX HUNDRED WALL 
WHICH IS HAND CRAFTED WALLPAPER 
THAT'S GOT TO GO UP AND BE IT IT HAS TO BE HAND CRAFTED WALLPAPER 
IF YOU WANT IT TO BE THE WAY IT WAS 
AND PRESERVE THE MAJESTY OF THE 
PLACE PLACE A LOT OF PEOPLE LISTENING WILL 
THINK SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND AT A TIME WHEN THEY 
ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR FOOD 
BILLS BECAUSE OF RISING PRICES 
THEY WILL THEY WILL FIND THE 
DISMISSIVE OF THAT 
I DISMISS IT 
IN ATTACHMENT TO THE SPEAKER THERE 
MIGHT BE AN ISSUE SHOULD THE HOUSE 
OF COMMONS BE SPENDING SUCH AN 
AMOUNT ON THE STATE APARTMENTS TO 
MAINTAIN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND 
ITS GRANDEUR AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT 
STORY THE ESTIMATES COMMISSION ARE 
LOOKING AT THE RULES OF EXPENSES 
AND THAT SHOULD HAPPEN AND HAPPEN 
VERY VERY QUICKLY AND GET THE 
CLARITY AND TRANSPARENCY THAT 
EVERYBODY WANTS 
KEN CLARKE CAN MICHAEL MARTIN 
CONTINUE TO CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE 
CONTINUE TO BE THE SPEAKER WHEN THE 
INVESTIGATION IS HANGING OVER HIS 
HEAD 
YES I THINK HE CAN L. WOULD HEAD HAPPILY DEFEND MICHAEL MARTIN 
AGAINST THE REAL CAMPAIGN THAT'S 
BEEN RUN AGAINST HIM HE IS A GOOD 
SPEAKER SPEAKER DO YOU THINK IT IS JUST THAT IT IS 
A MEDIA CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM 
LEAVING THAT ON ONE SIDE THE THE 
ROW ABOUT THE TAXI FARES OF HIS 
WIFE WHICH IS THE ONLY SERIOUS 
THING IT IS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 
SPEAKER DIRECTLY THE WIFE'S TAXI 
FARES ARE A PROBLEM THEY SHOULD OF 
BEEN REFERRED TO AN AUDITOR BEFORE 
WE HAVE THIS FLURRY OF EXCITEMENT 
WHICH WAS AN ACCIDENT WAIT TO GO 
HAPPEN BEFORE DEREK CONWAY THE 
TASKFORCE HAD RECOMMENDED TO DAVID 
CAMERON AND HE HAD AGREED WE WE 
SHOULD HAVE INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE 
AUDIT OF M. P.'S EXPENSES THEY SHOULD 
BE CHECKED AND M. P.'S SHOULD BE ASKED 
TO JUSTIFY THEM THERE SHOULD BE 
RANDOM CHECKS WITH THE ONE IN TEN 
BEING DONE OVER AND MADE PRODUCE 
RECEIPTS RECEIPTS THEY SHOULDN'T BE CAPPED 
WE HAVE RULE BOOKS AND A 
COMMISSIONER IS GOING TO 
INVESTIGATE MRS. MARTIN'S TAXI FARES 
THIS IS NONSENSE IF YOU HAVE A ROW 
ABOUT EXPENSES IN THE B. B. C. AND I'M 
NOT DOING WHAT ABOUT JOURNALISTS 
STUFF THAT SOME OF MY SENIOR 
COLLEAGUES ARE GOING FOR IF YOU 
HAVE A ROW ABOUT EXPENSES THERE IS 
AN AUDITOR IF YOU YOU CAN'T 
SATISFY THE AUDITOR YOU MADE TO 
PAY IT BACK AND THE MANAGER IS 
ASKED WHY DIDN'T YOU SIT ON HER 
EXPENSES AND NOTICE SHE WAS 
CLAIMING MORE THAN WAS REASONABLE 
WE HAVE A GREAT PUBLIC PERFORMANCE 
AND THE SOONER WE BRING IN 
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS AND ENCOURAGE 
THEM TO DO A RIGOROUS CHECK OF 
PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE 
RECEIPTS AND JUSTIFICATION THE 
BETTER IT IS A BOGUS PLIT PLIT 
POLITICAL STORY WHAT WORRIES ME IS 
THE DAMAGE IT IS DOING TO POLITICS 
YOU ARE RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED 
ACTUALLY ACTUALLY WE WILL SEE IF IT COMES UP IN PMQS 
BUT I DOUBT IT 
I DON'T DOUBT IT WILL COME UP IN 
OUR E. MAILS WATCH THIS SPACE 
NOW IT TO THAT NATO SUMMIT AND THE 
EVENTS IN AFGHANISTAN PADDY 
ASHDOWN SAID THIS MORNING THAT NATO 
IS COMING CLOSE TO LOSING IN ITS 
BATTLE AGAINST THE TALEBAN 
BRITISH AMERICAN CANADIAN AND 
DUTCH FORCES ARE BATTLING THERE 
ALONGSIDE TROOPS FROM OVER FORTY OTHER 
COUNTRIES BUT IT IS MAINLY THE 
BRITISH THE AMERICANS THE DUTCH 
THE CANADIANS DOING THE FIGHTING 
MANY OF THE OTHER TROOPS DEPLOYED 
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES ARE RESTRICTED 
BY SO CALLED CAVEATS WHICH PREVENT 
THEM FROM BEING DEPLOYED TO WHERE 
THEY ARE NEEDED AND WHERE THE REAL 
FIGHTING IS THE PRESIDENT AND THE 
PRIME MINISTER ARE TRYING TO GET 
CONTRIBUTING COUNTRIES TO UP THEIR 
GAME AND PROVIDE MORE TROOPS WITH 
WIDER REMIT WARNING THAT FAILURE 
IS NOT AN OPTION THERE 
THEY HAVE TRIED BEFORE AND FAILED 
THE SIGNS DON'T LOOK GOOD THIS TIME 
J. ENNY THIS IS CRUCIAL SUMMIT 
IT IS YES IT IS NATO'S BIGGEST 
SUMMIT AND IT BEGINS TODAY IN RO 
MAIN OWE WITH OVER FIFTY WORLD LEADERS 
GATHERING FOR TALKS DISCUSSIONS 
WILL FOCUS ON THE CAMPAIGN IN 
AFGHANISTAN WHICH CONFRONTS NATO 
WITH ITS GREATEST TEST SINCE THE 
COLD WAR THERE ARE FORTY THREE THOUSAND TROOPS 
IN AFGHANISTAN 
IN AFGHANISTAN 
IN AFGHANISTAN THEY ARE FROM ALL TWENTY SIX NATO COUNTRIES 
BUT ONLY HANDFUL OF THOSE MAINLY 
BRITISH AND AMERICAN SOLDIERS ARE 
ACTUALLY SHOULDERING THE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FRONT LINE 
FIGHTING AT THE SUMMIT GORDON 
BROWN AND GEORGE BUSH WILL BE 
PUSHING THE OTHER COUNTRIES TO 
SHARE MORE OF THAT BURDEN 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WILL BE 
DISCUSSING TOMORROW THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY IS THE BURDEN SHARING 
BETWEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND HOW 
COUNTRIES THAT PERHAPS ARE NOT 
MAKING THE CONTRIBUTION THAT THEY 
CAN CAN MAKE MORE OF A 
CONTRIBUTION AND COUNTRIES THAT 
CANNOT SEND FIGHTING TROOPS FOR ALL 
SORTS OF REASONS MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
HELP WITH EQUIPMENT AND WE CAN HAVE 
A BETTER BURDEN SHARING AMONGST OUR 
ALLIES ALLIES FRANCE IS EXPECTED TO RESPOND BY 
CONFIRMING A FEW HUNDRED EXTRA 
FRENCH TROOPS THAT SHOULD GO 
BETWEEN SOME WAY OF EASING A RIFT 
BETWEEN BRITAIN AND AMERICA 
OTHER NATIONS ARE REFUSE TO GO MOVE 
TO THE FRONT LINE BECAUSE AT HOME 
THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN IS DEEPLY 
UNPOPULAR NATO'S COMMANDER ON THE 
GROUND HE IS THE MAN WHO COMMANDS 
THE FORTY THREE MILLION THOUSAND HE SAYS TO FIGHT 
THE LEVELS OF INSURGENCY IN A 
COUNTRY OF AFGHANISTAN'S SIZE AND 
POPULATION THE TROOP LEVELS SHOULD 
BE MORE LIKE TEN TIMES THAT FIGURE 
AT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WE HOPE TO SPEAK TO OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IN KABUL WE ARE 
GOING TO TRY WE ARE HAVING 
PROBLEMS WITH THE LINE BUT WE WILL 
TRY AND SPEAK TO ALISTAIR NOW 
GIVEN THAT THE SCALE OF TROOPS THAT 
THOSE COMMANDERS ASKED FOR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY WHAT'S THE 
MINIMUM MINIMUM COMMANDERS OUT 
THERE ON THE GROUND WANT TO SEE AS 
A RESULT OF THE SUMMIT 
I SPOKE TO THE COMMANDER OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE 
FORCE A FEW DAYSS AGO HE SAYS HE 
DOESN'T PUT A NUMBER NUMBER ON 
THESE THINGS IT IS RESOURCES AND 
BOOTS ON THE GROWN AND THE FIGURE 
OF TEN THOUSAND HAS BEEN BANDED AROUND AS 
SOMETHING THEY WOULD LIKE 
THAT 
SEEMS UNLIKELY 
IT IS ABOUT HELICOPTERS IT IS 
ABOUT INTELLIGENCE UNITS COMING OUT 
HERE IT IS ABOUT TRAINING FOR THE 
AV BEGAN POLICE AND ARMY AND IT IS 
BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO ACTUALLY GO 
OUT INTO THE AREAS TO SPREAD THE 
THE FOOTPRINT OF NATO FORCES WHICH 
FALLS IN LINE WITH THEIR 
COUNTERINSURGENCY STRATEGY WHICH IS 
GETTING OUT GETTING THEIR TROOPS 
ALONGSIDE AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES ON 
THE BEAT IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE 
PEOPLE SEE THERE IS A PRESENCE AND 
ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE SUPPORTING 
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL FORCES THAN THEY ARE 
THE TALEBAN 
DO THE COMMANDERS ON THE GROUND 
FEEL SUPPORTED BY NATO OR DO THEY 
FEEL LET DOWN BY NATO 
THEY FEEL LET DOWN BY THE COUNTRIES 
THAT MAKE UP THE CONTRIBUTIONS 
THERE ARE FORTY DIFFERENT NATION 
INVOLVED IN A FORCE OF FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND AT 
THE MOMENT AND THE COMMANDERS SAY 
YES WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN 
NUMBERS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE 
OVER TEN THOUSAND BUT THEY NEED MORE AND 
THEY DO HEAR THE CALLS FOR MORE 
TROOPS GOING UNANSWERED AND THAT IS 
FRUSTRATING WHEN THEY THINK THEY 
CAN DO MORE ON THE GROUND HERE THE 
FEELING IS THERE WILL BE MORE 
COMING OUT OF THIS SUMMIT 
CERTAINLY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 
HAS BEEN DEBATING THIS WITHIN ITS 
SIEVE AS TO HOW MANY MORE MORE 
BRITISH TROOPS IT COULD AFFORD TO 
SEND OUT HERE THE POLES HAVE 
COMMITTED TO ONE THOUSAND THE FRENCH 
COMMITTED TO HUNDREDS AS WE HAVE 
HEARD MOST LIKELY TO HEAD INTO THE 
EAST TO FREE UP MORE AMERICAN 
FIGHTING UNITS TO HEAD INTO THE 
MORE DANGEROUS SOUTH THERE IS 
MOVEMENT MOVEMENT BUT THEY WANT 
MORE IN TERMS OF KIT THE AMERICANS 
ARE COMMITTED THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED MARINES TO 
AFGHANISTAN TO SOUTHERN 
AFGHANISTAN WHO ARE ARRIVING AT 
THE MOMENT A LOT OF THESE WILL BE 
ON THE GROUND IN HELMAND AND THEY 
BRING WITH THEM HUGE RESOURCES TWENTY 
HELICOPTERS A NUMBER OF HARRIERS 
TRANSPORTER PLANES ARTILLERY IT 
IS THIS KIND OF PACKAGE AS THEY 
CALL IT IT IT THAT THEY WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE FROM MORE NIGHT OWE NATIONS 
AND MORE SUPPORTERS TO GET MORE 
EFFECT ON THE GROWN THEY BELIEVE 
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS WORKING IF 
THEY HAVE MORE MEN THEY THINK IT 
WILL BE A BETTER WAY OF DEALING 
WITH IT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
RUTIALT 
WE ARE JOINED BY THE FORMER ARMY 
COMMANDER MAJOR GENERAL CORD CORD 
LET'S LOOK CORDINGLEY IF YOU 
WERE THE TALEBAN YOU WOULD SAY 
WE WILL WIN THIS LOT THEY ONLY 
HAVE FORTY THOUSAND TROOPS THERE HALF 
DON'T WANT TO FIGHTMENT ALL OF US 
ARE FIGHTING WE JUST BIDE OUR TIME 
WE WILL SEE THEM OFF WE DID KNIT 
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WE WILL DO IT 
AGAIN 
SO MANY ANSWERS TO THAT AGAIN LET'S GO TO HELMAND PROVINCE AND AS 
FAR AS THE BRITISH ARE CONCERNED 
THE BRITISH HAVE GOT TO A STAGE 
WHERE THEY CAN DEFEAT THE TALEBAN 
IN ANY PARTICULAR ENGAGEMENT THE 
PROBLEM AS ALISTAIR LEITHEAD 
POINTED OUT IS THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH 
TROOPS TO HOLD THAT GROUND THAT IS 
THE PROBLEM 
THERE IS NOT GOING TO 
BE 
I DON'T THINK 
HELMAND IS BE THE SIZE OF WALES WE HAVE SEVEN THOUSAND 
TROOPS WE THE BRITISH ARMY WE DO 
NOT DO HELICOPTERS WE CANNOT 
PATROL WITH ENOUGH HELICOPTERS WE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HELICOPTERS EVEN 
IF WE SENT EVERYTHING OUT THERE L. 
FIND IT DIFFICULT TO THINK WE WILL 
BE ABLE TO PUT MORE TROOPS IN 
OURSELVES PARTICULARLY WITH 
KEEPING THE SAME NUMBER IN THE 
BASRA 
WHICH WE SEEM TO HAVE TO DO BASRA AS LENIN ASKED WHAT IS TO BE DONE 
WELL ONE SIDE OF WELL I THINK THIS 
WILL TAKE A VERY LONG TIME 
SECONDLY I DO HAVE SYMPATHY FOR 
THOSE IN THE NORTH T. GERMANS WHO 
WENT UNDER A PARTICULAR RULE OF 
ENGAGEMENT AND CHANGE THEREFORE 
POLITICALLY THIS IS NOT POPULAR L. 
HAVE SOME SIMPA FOR THAT WHAT IS 
TO HAPPEN THE AMERICANS ARE 
PUTTING MORE IN IT NEEDS TEN THOUSAND 
CURIOUS HELMAND IS NOT THE MAJOR 
PROBLEM KANDAHAR IS THE PROBLEM 
THEY ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY IN THE 
END WHAT IS THE PURPOSE WE KNOW 
THE POTENTIAL TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES 
AGAIN IF THE TALEBAN WERE TO WIN 
BUT THERE ARE THEY ARE ALREADY IN 
CHARGE OF TEN PER CENT OF THE COUNTRY 
PRESIDENT KARZAI'S RULE'S BARELY 
REACHES THE OUTER LIMITS OF KABUL 
THE POPPY HARVEST QUOTE HAS 
NEVER BEEN BETTER WE CANNOT GET 
ANYONE TO PUT IN MORE TROOPS WHERE 
DO WE GO 
THIS IS A POLITICAL 
PROBLEM I THINK PADDY ASHDOWN IF 
IF HE HAD GONE WOULD HAVE MADE AN 
JOINT UP POLITICAL SITUATION HERE 
KARZAI DIDN'T WANT IT 
HE DID NOT 
REALLY WANT IT THERE IS NO CLEAR 
POLITICAL OVERALL STRATEGY GOING ON 
IN THE COUNTRY THAT IS THE KEY TO 
ALL THIS 
ISN'T IT UNFAIR IT IS 
GOING TO THE VERY SOUL OF THE 
BRITISH ARMY AT THE MOMENT OUR 
TROOPS ARE BEING ASKED TO DO SOME 
OF THE FERSEST FIGHTING SINCE THE 
FALKLANDS OR WORLD WAR TWO 
SOMETIMES HAND TO HAND COMBAT WITH 
THE NATO ALLIES NOT EVEN IN SOME 
CASES BEING PREPARED TO PATROL IN 
THE DARK NOT A GREAT SIGN OF AN 
ALLIANCE 
I THINK THE BRITISH ALLIANCE SOLDIERS ARE IMMENSELY PROUD OF 
WHAT THEY ARE DOING 
WE ARE 
IMMENSELY PROUD OF WHAT THEY ARE 
DOING 
IF I COULD CONTRADICT ONE DOING THING THEY ARE WELL EQUIPPED NOW 
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THEY DON'T HAVE 
ENOUGH OF THE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED 
AS GOING BACK TO THE HELICOPTER 
COMMENTS 
HOW CAN YOU BE WELL COMMENTS EQUIPPED AND NOT HAVE ENOUGH 
EQUIPMENT 
ALL THE CRITICISMS ABOUT EQUIPMENT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT RIFLES 
OR BOOTS THAT HAS BEEN RESOLVED 
THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN BETTER 
EQUIPPED THEY ARE JUST SHORT OF 
THINGS LIKE HELICOPTERS SORT OF 
THOSE SORT OF THINGS ACTUALLY IF 
YOU WERE GOING TO INCREASE IN SIZE 
YOU NEED MORE OF 
WHY ARE THEY 
SHORT OF THESE THINGS MR. MCNULTY 
WE ARE ASKING THESE YOUNG MEN AND 
WOMEN TO LAY THEIR LIVES DOWN FOR 
AN UNCERTAIN MISSION A PURPOSE NOT 
REALLY DEFINED WHY AREN'T THEY 
BETTER EQUIPPED 
AS HAS BEEN SAID 
THEY ARE BETTER EQUIPPED NOW THAN 
THEY WERE THAT IS RIGHT AND PROPER 
EQUALLY WHAT WAS SAID IS EVEN IF WE 
SENT EVERY SINGLE HELICOPTER THAT 
WE HAD AT OUR DISPOSAL THERE THAT 
WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE 
CAUSE IT GOES BACK TO THE ISSUE OF 
GETTING THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN 
PLACE I THINK IT WAS A MATTER OF 
REJECT THAT ASHDOWN DIDN'T DO THAT 
I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD 
AT THE TIME AND THE SUMMIT IS SO 
HUGELY IMPORTANT TO GET IF NOT 
BOOTS ON THE GROUND FROM COLLEAGUE 
NATO COUNTRIES MORE AND MORE OF 
THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE NEED AND 
TRYING TO GARNER TOGETHER THAT 
THE FRENCH HAVE COMMITTED TO ONE THOUSAND 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME YOU JUST 
SAID SOMETHING THERE EXPLAIN TO 
OUR VIEWERS WHAT THE WORD 
COMMITTED MEANS IN FRENCH THE THE SAME AS IN ENGLISH 
WE ARE LEARNING 
THIS MORNING MR. SARKOZY AFTER HIS 
GRANDSTANDING LAST WEEK IS SAYING 
HOLD ON A MOMENT I DON'T LIKE 
GEORGIA AND UKRAINE COMING IN I AM 
NOT SURE WHAT THE NATO MISSION IS 
IN AFGHANISTAN MAYBE IT IS ONLY A 
COUPLE OF HUNDRED A LOT OF THAT IS 
LIKE MANY THINGS MR. SARKOZY SAYS 
DISAPPEARING IN THE SAND 
AS HAS 
BEEN SUGGESTED IT WILL BE INTENSELY 
POLITICAL IT IS NATO IT IS A 
MILITARY ORGANISATION AND THIS 
SORT OF POLITICS DOES NEED TO BE 
WORKED OUT SOME OF THE 
RAMIFICATIONS ARE GOOD TOO CANADA 
IS DOING FIERCE WORK UP IN KANDAHAR 
WE MENTION THE CANADIANS AND THE 
DUTCH TOO THEY ARE DOING FIGHTING 
THE BRITISH AND THE AMERICANS WE 
ARE BETWEEN ROCK AND A HARD PLACE 
HERE THE CONSEQUENCES OF LOSING IN 
AFGHANISTAN ARE HORRENDOUS BUT THE 
WAY WE ARE GOING WE WILL NOT WIN 
I AGREE WITH BOTH THOSE 
PROPOSITIONS WHICH IS WHY THIS 
SUMMIT IS SO IMPORTANT SARKOZY 
LAST WEEK TO BE FAIR SAID HE 
WOULD COMMIT ONE THOUSAND AT THE TIME BUT 
SUBJECT TO SOME AGREEMENT ON WHAT 
THE STRATEGY WAS AND HOW IT WOULD 
BE USED WE ARE NEAR TO AGREEING 
WHAT THIS SUMMIT SHOULD START WITH 
IS DECIDING TO GET SOME AGREEMENT 
ON STRATEGY AT THE MOMENT AT LEAST 
THREE DIFFERENT SORTS OF WAR ARE 
BEING FOUGHT OUT THERE BY DIFFERENT 
NATO ALLIES EACH OF WHOM ARE 
SAYING WE DIDN'T SIGN UP TO TAKE 
PART IN WHAT THE OTHERS ARE DOING 
SO BEYOND DEFEATING THE TALEBAN 
WHICH I AM THINK WE ARE ALL AGREED 
UPON ARE WE NATION BUILDING ARE 
WE TRYING TO SET UP A STABLE AFGHAN 
GOVERNMENT HOW ARE WE THINKING OF 
GETTING THERE WHAT SORT OF 
GOVERNMENT WILL WE ACCEPT AND 
BASICALLY WHAT IS THE POLICY WE ARE 
ALL AGREED UPON WHICH WE CAN START 
PRODUCING TROOPS TO PURSUE AT THE 
MOMENT 
SOUND LIKE IT COULD BE A MOMENT LONG SUMMIT 
IT STARTED WITH 
OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM EVEN 
THE AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATES SAY THEY ARE THERE TO 
LOOK FOR BIN LADEN AND THEY ARE 
STILL ATTACKING INSURGENTS 
WE NEED 
TO MOVE ON 
SEPARATE SPECIAL FORCES 
ARE WE NATION BUILDING OR NOT SO SO FAR I WOULD SAY NOT A COUPLE OF E. 
MAILS FIRST PAUL SAYS SOLUTION 
NUMBER ONE WOULD BE TO PAY THE 
GOING RIGHT FOR THE POPPIES RATHER 
THAN BURNING THEM THAT WOULD GET 
THE LOCALS ON SIDE A BETTER USE OF 
MONEY THAN BUTER MOUNTAINS THIS 
ONE SAYS WHAT ARE WE DOING IN 
AFGHANISTAN WE ARE BETTER OFF 
BOMBING BASES AL QAEDA HAS THERE 
SADLY WE DON'T HAVE ANY BUTER 
MOUNTAINS ANY MORE L. LIKE THEM WE

I COMMEND MY HONOURABLE FRIEND FOR 
THE WORK HE DOES IN HIS ALL PARTY 
AND HE IS RIGHT THAT THE WHOLE 
HOUSE WILL EXPRESS ITS CONCERN AND 
SOLIDARITY FOR THE PEOPLE OF 
ZIMBABWE AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE 
THEIR DEMOCRATIC DEMOCRATIC CHOICE 
RESPECTED AND RECOGNISED 
HONOURABLE MEMBERS 
ON ALL SIDES OF 
THE HOUSE RAISE THE PLIGHT OF THE 
PEOPLE IN ZIMBABWE FOUR MILLION 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FORCE TODAY FLEE

EXPECTANCY IS NOW DOWN TO THIRTY FOUR AND 
THE ECONOMY IS IN RUINS 
BUT TODAY THE EYES OF THE WORLD 
ARE ON ON ZIMBABWE AND ZIMBABWE 
STANDS AT A TURNING POINT ROBERT 
MUGABE MUST RESPECT THE DECISION OF 
HIS PEOPLE 
MR. SPEAKER I JOIN THE LEADER OF 
THE HOUSE IN PAYING TRIBUTE TO 
LIEUTENANT JOHN THORNTON AND DAVID 
MARSH WHO WERE KILLED IN 
AFGHANISTAN A REMINDER OF THE 
SACRIFICES AND SERVICE OF OUR ARMED 
FORCES ARMED FORCES AND ON A 
LIGHTER NOTE I WOULD LIKE TO 
CONGRATULATE THE LEADER OF THE 
HOUSE ON THE FIRST FEMALE MEMBER TO 
ANSWER PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTION 
TIME SHE MUST BE PROUD THREE 
DECADES ON TO BE FOLLOWING IN THE 
FOOTSTEPS OF MARGARET THATCHER 
WHO WE ON THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
AND THE PRIME MINISTER SO MUCH 
ADMIRE ADMIRE JUST ONE QUESTION ON ZIMBABWE 
BEFORE THE FOREIGN SECRETARY'S 
STATEMENT AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY WILL SHE MAKE 
IT CLEAR ON BEHALF OF THE PRIME 
MINISTER THAT BRITAIN WANTS TO SEND 
A CLEAR SIGNAL THAT THE WORLD WORLD 
WILL BE THERE TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF 
ZIMBABWE AND THERE WILL BE A PLAN 
TO ASSIST THEM WHENEVER THEY ARE 
ABLE TO MOVE AWAY FROM CORRUPTION 
AND DICTATORSHIP TO THE RULE OF LAW 
AND DEMOCRACY 
WELL I THANK HIM FOR HIS 
CONGRATULATIONS BUT I WOULD ASK 
HIM WHY IS HE HE ASKING THE 
QUESTIONS TODAY 
BECAUSE HE IS NOT THE SHADOW LEADER 
OF THE HOUSE THE SHADOW LEADER OF 
THE HOUSE IS SITTING NEXT TO HIM 
COMMENT COMMENT 
THAT'S THERESA MAY IS THIS THE SITUATION IS THIS THE 
SITUATION IN THE MODERN 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT WOMEN 
SHOULD BE SEEN BUT NOT HEARD 
AND IF I MAY IF I MAY PERHAPS I 
COULD OFFER THE SHADOW LEADER OF 
THE HOUSE A BIT OF SISTERLY ADVICE 
SHE SHOULD NOT LET HIM GETAWAY WITH 
IT IT AND ON THE QUESTION ON THE 
QUESTION ON THE QUESTION 
ON THE QUESTION ON THE QUESTION 
OF ZIMBABWE I ENDORSE THE COMMENTS 
THAT THE HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN HAS 
HAS MADE AND I ENDORSE THEM ON 
BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT THIS 
GOVERNMENT IS THE BIGGEST SECOND 
BIGGEST DONOR TO ZIMBABWE WE STAND 
READY TO STEP UP THAT SUPPORT AND 
WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BUT THERE 
IS A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON SOUTH 
AFRICA AND AFRICA TO HELP FIND A 
SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM AND MIGHT 
RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAS SPOKEN TO MR. MBEKI AND 
KOFI ANNAN AND WE WILL MAKE SURE 
THAT THE PRESSURE IS ON ROBERT 
MUGABE TO RESPECT THE DEM 
DEMOCRATIC CHOICE OF HIS PEOPLE 
HIGH PRESSURE 
TURNING TO DOMESTIC 
ISSUES I WAS GOING TO BE RIGHT TO 
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY 
SHE HAS HAD A DIFFICULT WEEK AND 
SHE HAD TO EXPLAIN YESTERDAY THAT 
SHE DRESSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
WRIFER WHEREVER SHE GOES SHE WEARS 
A HELMET TO A BUILDING SITE WEARS 
INDIAN CLOTHES WHEN SHE GOES TO AN 
INDIAN PARTY AND PRESUMABLY WHEN 
SHE GOES TO A CABINET MEETING SHE 
DRESSES AS A CLOWN L. WAS GOING TO 
BE NICE TO HER BEFORE THAT TURNING 
TO SERIOUS DOMESTIC ISSUES THE 
PRIME MINISTER IS REPORTED TO HAVE 
SAID ON MONDAY NIGHT THAT THAT 
NOBODY WOULD WORSE OFF AS A RESULT 
OF THE DOUBLING OF THE TEN PENCE 
TAX BAND DOES SHE THINK THAT 
STATEMENT WAS TRUE 
I WILL START BY 
SAYING THAT THAT IF I'M LOOKING 
FOR ADVICE ON WHAT TO WEAR OR WHAT 
NOT TO WEAR I THINK THE VERY LAST 
PERSON I WOULD LOOK TO ADVICE IS 
THE MAN IN THE BASEBALL CAP 
A PHOTOGRAPH OF WILLIAM HAGUE MANY YEARS AGO ON A 
ROLLER SKATE WITH A BASEBALL CAP 
IT HAS BEEN OUR GOVERNMENT'S 
DETERMINATION TO ENSURE WE HAVE 
STRONG GROWING AND STABLE ECONOMY 
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BE IN WORK BE 
IN THEIR JOBS AND BE BETTER OFF 
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT PEOPLE 
SHOULD HAVE JOBS AND THAT THEY 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEIR 
MORTGAGES AND I WOULD SAY BEFORE 
THE HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN THE RIGHT 
HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN CRIES 
CROCODILE TEARS ABOUT LOW INCOME 
FAMILIES PERHAPS I CAN REMEND THE 
HOUSE THAT WHEN HE WAS LEADER OF 
THE OPPOSITION IT WAS HE THAT LED 
THE OPPOSITION TO OUR NATIONAL 
MINIMUM WAGE AND IT WAS HE THAT LED 
THE OPPOSITION ON TAX CREDITS WHICH 
ARE HELPING SIX MILLION LOW INCOME 
FAMILIES FAMILIES I DIDN'T DETECT AN ANSWER TO THE 
QUESTION IN ALL OF THAT AND SHE 
MIGHT STILL NEED ADVICE ON WHAT TO 
WEAR IF SHE SHE THINKS HER 
CONSTITUENTS MIGHT KILL HER SHE 
SHOULD LOOK BEHIND HER 
BUT IS IT NOT THE CASE THAT 
CONTRARY TO WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER 
SAID ON MONDAY NIGHT FIFTY THREE MILLION 
MAINLY LOWER PAID FAMILIES WILL BE 
WORSE OFF THIS WEEKEND AS 
DEMONSTRATED BY THE INTERNATIONAL 
BY THE INSTITUTE OF FISCAL STUDIES 
AND AS CONFIRMED BY A TREASURY 
OFFICIAL TO THE TREASURY SELECT 
COMMITTEE IS SHE AWARE AFTER THE 
MEETING OF LABOUR M. P.'S ON MONDAY 
NIGHT WHERE THIS POINT WAS MADE 
ONE MINISTER SAID GORDON DIDN'T 
SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE 
TALKING ABOUT AND KEPT INSISTING 
NOBODY WOULD LOSE OUT HE DIDN'T 
SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHY VOTERS WERE 
UNHAPPY AND GAVE THE IMPRESSION HE 
WAS LIVING ON ANOTHER PLANET 
WASN'T THAT MINISTER SPEAKING THE 
TRUTH WAS IT BY ANY CHANCE HER 
I THINK ONE THING WE DO RECOGNISE 
THE TAX BURDEN THE TAX BURDEN 
UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT IS NOT AS 
HIGH IT IS NOT AS HIGH AS IT WAS 
UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF WHICH HE 
WAS A PART 
AND I WOULD ALSO SAY WHEN IT COMES 
TO TO STANDARDS OF LIFLG WHEN IT 
IT COMES TO STANDARD OF LIVING 
WHEN WE CAME INTO GOVERNMENT THIS 
COUNTRY WAS THE THE WORST AMONGST 
THE THE G. SEVEN FOR AVERAGE INCOME PER 
HEAD AND AFTER TEN YEARS OF LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT WE ARE SECOND FROM THE 
TOP AND WE STAND BY THAT RECORD 
IF SHE THINKS THE TAX BAURDEN IS 
DECLINING IN THIS COUNTRY THE 
GOVERNMENT IS MORE OUT OF TOUCH 
THAN ANYBODY THOUGHT IT MIGHT OF 
BEEN THE COST OF LIVING IS RISING 
REAL EARNINGS HAVE FALLEN FOR TWO 
YEARS THE GOVERNMENT HAVE CHOSEN 
THIS MOMENT TO HIT FIVE MILLION 
MAINLY LOWER PAID FAMILIES TO KICK 
THEM WHEN THEY ARE DOWN 
LET ME READ WHAT ANOTHER MINISTER 
SAID ON THE RECORD THIS TIME THE 
HEALTH MINISTER WHO SAID PEOPLE 
FEEL THE GOVERNMENT IS LOSING TOUCH 
WITH WHAT FAIRNESS MEANS TO THE 
MAJORITY WHO WORK HARD PLAY BY THE 
RULES AND ARE FEELING SQUEEZED BY 
RISING UTILITY BILLS THE COST OF 
PETROL AND RISING COUNCIL TAX 
DOESN'T SHE HAVE A BIT OF SYMPATHY 
WITH THE VIEW OF THAT MINISTER 
THAT PEOPLE FEEL THE GOVERNMENT IS 
OUT OF TOUCH OUT OF TOUCH I DO THINK THAT IT IS RIGHT TO 
RECOGNISE THAT WITH THE 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL TURBULENCE 
AND UNCERTAINTY THAT PEOPLE THAT 
PEOPLE ARE APPREHENSIVE AND THEY 
NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK TO THE 
GOVERNMENT TO HAVE THE 
DETERMINATION THAT WE WILL MAKE 
SURE THAT OUR ECONOMY IS AS 
RESILIENT AS POSSIBLE AS THIS 
COUNTRY FACES DIFFICULT AND 
CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES 
AND IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE IN TOUCH 
AND CONCERNED ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT 
MOST AFFECT THE BRITISH PEOPLE THAT 
WE HAVE IMPROVED HOSPITALS AND 
SCHOOLS THAT WE HAVE ENSURED THAT 
THERE ARE MORE JOBS IN THE ECONOMY 
AND THAT IS WHAT WE WILL CONTINUE 
TO DO 
SHE IS ALLOWED WHILE THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S NOT HERE TO SAY THE 
GOVERNMENT IS OUT OF TOUCH HE HAS 
GONE TO MEETING IN A PALACE SO 
HE IS PROBABLY LOST BY NOW 
SHE IS ALLOWED TO AGREE WITH THE 
MINISTER WHO SAID THE GOVERNMENT 
WAS WAS OUT OF TOUCH BUT SHE HAS 
ACKNOWLEDGED AND I THANK HER THAT 
PEOPLE ARE APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THE 
SITUATION BUT TWO MONTHS AGO SHE 
WROTE IN HER BLOG THERE WAS NO 
SENSE AT ALL OF CONCERN OR 
INSECURITY OVER THE ECONOMY PEOPLE 
ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THEIR OWN 
PROSPECTS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT DOES SHE NOW 
WANT TO UPDATE THAT STATEMENT IN 
THE LIGHT OF WHAT SHE JUST SAID AND 
SAY THAT PEOPLE ARE NOW 
APPREHENSIVE AND THAT THEY ARE 
FEELING INSECURE AND THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS IS OUT OF TOUCH 
WELL WHEN I WROTE THAT BLOG AS 
PART OF MY HARRIET IN THE HIGH 
STREET LISTENING WHEN I 
THAT WELL WHEN I. WHEN I 
WROTE THAT BLOG 
WHEN I WROTE THAT BLOG HAVING 
TALKED TO PEOPLE IN PRINCESS STREET 
IN EDINBURGH THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE 
WERE SAYING TO ME AND I ACKNOWLEDGE 
I ACKNOWLEDGE AND WE READILY 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SINCE THEN THE 
SITUATION INTERNATIONALLY HAS 
BECOME MORE TURBULENT AND PEOPLE'S 
CONCERNS ARE RAISED SO WE HAVE TO 
BE EVER VIGILANT AND MAKE SURE THAT 
WE CAN KEEP THE ECONOMY STRONG 
THROUGH DIFFICULT INTERNATIONAL 
TIMES IN WAY THAT THEIR PREVIOUS 
GOVERNMENT WASN'T AND AS FAR AS HIS 
JOKES ARE CONCERNED NORMALLY 
PEOPLE USE TODAY SAY ABOUT HIM 
GREAT JOKES POOR JUDGEMENT BUT I 
HAVE TO SAY ON TODAY'S PERFORMANCE 
HE SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT HIS 
INCOME AS AN AFTER DINNER SPEAKER 
I WON'T BE ACCUSED THE LADY OF 
BEING ALL JOKES 
BUT HASN'T SHE JUST GIVEN 
DEMONSTRATION OF HOW OUT OF TOUCH 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME FIVE 
MILLION FAMILIARIES WORSE OFF THIS 
WEEKEND AND THE PRIME MINISTER 
DENIES IT COUNCIL TAX HAS DOUBLED 
AS OF THIS WEEKEND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SMALL 
BUSINESSES WORSE OFF THIS WEEKEND 
AND ISN'T THE QUESTION THE WHOLE 
COUNTRY IS IS ASKING IS WHY DO WE 
HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER TWO YEARS TO 
GET RID OF THIS DISCREDITED CABINET 
AND HAVE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT OUR 
ECONOMY IS CONTINUING TO GROW AND 
THAT IS IMPORTANT VERY IMPORTANT 
WE RECOGNISE THAT IT WILL BE 
GROWING AT A SLOWER RATE THAN 
PREDICTED BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT 
IT CONTINUES TO GROW 
WE RECOGNISE TOO THAT THERE WILL BE 
CONTINUE INVESTMENT FROM BUSINESS 
AND IN INDUSTRY AND WE RECOGNISE 
TOO THAT WHAT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP 
THE ECONOMY GROWING IS TO ENSURE 
THAT THE SKILLS AND EDUCATION 
LEVELS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY 
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AND THAT'S WHY 
TO SECURE THE ECONOMY FOR THE 
FUTURE WE ARE ENSURING EDUCATION UP 
TO THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN FOR ALL PEOPLE IN 
THIS COUNTRY THAT WE ARE ENSURING 
MORE APPRENTICESHIPS FOR PEOPLE IN 
THIS COUNTRY AND ALSO WE ARE 
ENSURING THAT MORE PEOPLE HAVE A 
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION IF HE WAS 
CONCERNED FOR THE PROSPECTS OF OUR 
ECONOMY HE WOULD HAVE BACKING THAT 
NOT OPPOSING IT 
THE ENVIRONMENTAL LOBBY ARE URGING 
US TO SAVE THE PLANET BY DRINKING 
ONLY TAP WATER I HAVE TWO WATER 
BOTTLING PLANTS IN MY CONSTITUENCY 
AND CAN I ASK MY RIGHT HONOURABLE 
FRIEND TO AGREE IN ANY FUTURE 
DISCUSSIONS WE REMEMBER THE JOBS 
OF THOSE IN THE WATER BOTTLING 
INDUSTRY INDUSTRY WE DO HAVE TO RECOGNISE THAT WE 
HAVE TO BOTH ENSURE THAT THERE IS 
HIGH EMPLOYMENT IN THE ECONOMY 
INCLUDING IN HER AREA AND I KNOW 
SHE IS CHAMPION OF PEOPLE IN HER 
AREA BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT 
WE CUT DOWN ON UNNECESSARY WASTE 
AND THAT'S WHY THE GOVERNMENT IS 
INTRODUCING ACROSS THE PUBLIC 
SERVICES A DRINKING TAP WATER 
INSTEAD OF BOTTLED WATER 
ORDER ORDER CONDELENSES FOR THE SOLDIERS WHO 
WERE KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ 
IT WAS REPORTED EARLIER THIS WEEK 
THAT HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN HAD 
CANCELLED HER DIAMOND WEDDING 
CELEBRATIONS BECAUSE IT WAS JUDGED 
TO BE INAPPROPRIATE TO ENGAGE IN 
EXTRAVEGAPBS AT A TIME OF ECONOMIC 
GLOOM THIS SHOWS THE QUEEN'S 
INSTINCT FOSTR PUBLIC MODE OR WAS 
SHE OVER REACTING 
THE HONOURABLE MEMBER 
SHOULD NOT DISCUSS HER MAJESTY THE 
QUEEN 
CAN I RETURN TO THE ISSUE OF 
ECONOMIC GLOOM AND RECESSION 
OUR CONCERN AS I SAID TO THE RIGHT 
HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN OPPOSITE OUR 
CONCERN IS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE 
CONTINUE TO HAVE JOBS HE WILL KNOW 
THAT THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND VACANCIES 
STILL IN THE ECONOMY AND THAT WE 
WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE ECONOMY 
CONTINUES TO GROW AS IT HAS FOR 
SOMETHING LIKE I THINK SIXTY TWO 
CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER AS MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIEND 
I MUST MOVE ON 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER AS MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIEND IS AWARE TODAY 
IS WORLD AUTISM DAY AUTISM AFFECTS 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS 
AND FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED 
KINGDOM WHAT MESSAGE DOES SHE HAS 
TO THOSE PEOPLE ON THIS SPECIAL 
DAY 
I AM GLAD MY HONOURABLE FRIEND DAY HAS GIVEN ME THE OPPORTUNITY ON 
BEHALF OF THE PRIME MINISTER TO 
MARK NATIONAL AUTUMN TODAY THREE 
THINGS ARE IMPORTANT FIRST EARLY 
IDENTIFICATION THE EARLIER A CHILD 
CAN BE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING AN 
AUTISTIC DISORDER THE MORE HELP THE 
FAMILY AND CHILD CAN RECEIVE 
SECONDLY THE HEALTH SERVICES WHO 
HELP FAMILIES AND CHILDREN WITH 
AUTISM AND THE EDUCATION SERVICES 
ARE VITAL THAT IS WHY WE HAVE 
DOUBLED INVESTMENT IN SERVICES FOR 
CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 
THIRDLY ABOVE ALL I WOULD PAY 
TRIBUTE TO THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR 
PARTICULARLY THE NATIONAL AUTISTIC 
SOCIETY HORBGS ARE A LIFELINE FOR 
WHO ARE A LIFELINE FOR PARENTS AND 
WITHOUT WHOM MANY FAMILIES COULD 
NOT COPE 
THE U. K. AND SCOTTISH 
GOVERNMENT ARE RIGHT TO PROVIDE THE 
APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF PRISON PLACES 
WHY IS IT THE CASE THE U. K. TREASURY 
IS NOT FUNDING THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION OF 
KOPBS QUEN SHALL FUNDING WHICH 
COULD HELP OVERCROWDING IN 
SCOTLAND 
WE HAVE BUILT MORE SCOTLAND PRISONS AND INDEED MORE OFFENDERS 
ARE BEING BROUGHT TO JUSTICE WHICH 
IS WHY THERE IS AN INCREASE IN 
PRISON NUMBERS AS TO HIS POINT 
ABOUT PRISON PLACES IN SCOTLAND I 
WILL ASK MY RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND 
TO WRITE TO HIM 
THANK YOU LAST FRIDAY AFTER 
CAMPAIGNING I WENT TO MILOAL 
BANGLADESHI CURRY HOUSE WAS TOLD 
TOLD I WENT TO MY LOCAL 
BANGLADESHI CURRY HOUSE AND I WAS 
TOLD THAT THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE 
IS NOW VISITING BANGLADESHI 
RESTAURANTS BETWEEN SEVEN TO EIGHT P. M. ON 
SATURDAYS AT CRITICAL PERIODS FOR 
ANY RESTAURANT IT IS THE BUSIEST 
PERIOD THE WEEK THEY ARE CLOSING 
THE RESTAURANTS THEY GO WITHOUT 
PAYING FOR ANYTHING THEY LOSE 
THEIR REVENUE FOR FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY NIGHTS THIS IS NOT 
ACCEPTABLE THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO 
RING SOLICITOR NOT ALLOWED TO RING THEIR M. P. CAN I ASK MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIEND WHETHER SHE WOULD 
MEET A GROUP OF BANGLADESHI 
RESTAURANT OWNERS SO WE CAN CHANGE 
THE PROCESS OF THE IMMIGRATION 
SERVICES 
I KNOW MY HONOURABLE SERVICES FRIEND WILL UNDERSTAND THAT 
ENFORCEMENT OF IMMIGRATION RULES 
HAS TO BE AN OPERATIONAL MATTER FOR 
THE BORDER AND IMMIGRATION AGENCY 
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE 
BANGLADESHI CATERING ASSOCIATION 
HAS ALREADY MADE REPRESENTATIONS TO 
ME ON THIS ISSUE L. KNOW THAT THEY 
PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN THIS 
COUNTRY AND IN OUR ECONOMY AND I 
WOULD BE HAPPY WITH TO MEET 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BANGLADESHI 
CATERING ASSOCIATION 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER WOULD THE 
WILL THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY JOIN 
ME IN CONDEMNING NICK ERICSSON THE 
B. N. P. CANDIDATE FOR THE LONDON 
ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS WHO SAID TO 
SUGGEST THAT RAPE IS SERIOUS 
CRIME IS LIKE SAYING FORCE FEEDING 
WOMEN A CHOCOLATE CAKE IS HEINOUS 
AFFAIR WILL SHE JOIN ME IN SAYING 
THIS MAN IS NOT FIT TO RUN FOR 
PUBLIC OFFICE 
I STRONGLY SUPPORT 
THE COMMENTS OF MY HONOURABLE 
MEMBER IT IS FOR ALL OF US ALL 
PARTIES IN LONDON TO SAY THAT WE 
HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT 
EVERYBODY VOTES IN THE LONDON 
ELECTION BECAUSE THE BEST WAY TO 
AVOID THE BEST WAY TO AVOID A 
B. N. P. MEMBER BEING ELECTED TO THE 
GREATER LONDON ASSEMBLY IS TO MAKE 
SURE AS MANY POEM AS POSSIBLE VOTE 
FOR ALL THE OTHER PARTIES 
THAT AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE 
VOTE FOR ALL THE OTHER PARTIES THE THE SCIENTIFIC AND INNOVATION CAMPUS IS 
A GREAT SUCCESS FOR THE NORTH WEST 
REGION FOR THE COUNTRY AND FOR 
WORLD CLASS SCIENCE DOES MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIEND AGREE THAT ITS 
FUTURE IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE LEFT 
SOLELY IN THE HANDS OF THE 
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH COUNCIL 
INVOLVED 
MY HONOURABLE FRIEND IS A INVOLVED GREAT CHAMPION OF SCIENCE AND 
INDEED OF THE CENTRE IN HER 
CONSTITUENCY I PAY TRIBBUETD TO 
HER FOR THAT SHE AND I PAY 
TRIBUTE TO HER FOR THAT SHE WILL 
KNOW THIS GOVERNMENT HAS DOUBLED 
INVESTMENT IN SCIENCE SHE WILL 
KNOW THE MINISTER FOR STATE IS IN 
HER CONSTITUENCY TODAY ANNOUNCING 
TWENTY FIVE MILLION EXTRA FUNDS FOR THE 
NEXT PHASE FOR THE SCIENCE AND 
INNOVATION CAMPUS 
THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE EXPLAIN TO 
COUNCIL TENANTS IN MY CONSTITUENCY 
WHY THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT ASKED 
THEM TO SUBSIDISE OTHERS IN THE 
COUNTRY WHY IS IT FOR EVERY ONE 
THAT COUNCIL TENANT PAYS IN RENT 
TO KINGSTON THE GOVERNMENT TAKES 
THIRTY ONE P. AWAY TO GIVE TO OTHER COUNCILS 
THE PRIME MINISTER TOLD THE HOUSE 
IN JULY LAST YEAR HE WOULD REFORM 
THIS UNFAIR SYSTEM WHY HAS NOTHING 
BEEN DONE 
WE ARE REVIEWING THE WAY THE 
HOUSING REVENUE FUND WORKS L. WOULD 
SAY THAT I HOPE THAT HE WOULD JOIN 
WITH ME IN WELCOMING THE FACT THAT 
IN ALL THE COUNCIL ESTATES AND 
BLOCKS IN HIS CONSTITUENCY THERE 
HAVE BEEN NEW ROOFS THERE HAVE 
BEEN NEW WINDOWS THERE HAVE BEEN 
NEW LIFTS AND THAT THERE HAS BEEN 
MAJOR INVESTMENT IN COUNCIL HOUSING 
SINCE THIS GOVERNMENT CAME INTO 
POWER THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER 
WILL MY RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND 
PASS MY QUESTION TO THE PRIME 
MINISTER ISN'T IT TIME GIVEN THE 
ANXIETY OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR THE 
AIRPORTS IN LONDON PARTICULARLY 
HEATHROW THAT THERE WAS A FRESH 
REVIEW OF AIRPORT'S POLICY THAT IN 
FACT WHEN YOU LOCK AT THIS COUNTRY 
AND CONSIDER THE NUMBER OF 
BUSINESSMEN AND TOUR RISTS WHO 
HAVE TO TRAVEL FROM THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND TO LONDON BEFORE THEY CAN 
GO ABROAD IT IS ABSOLUTELY 
LUDICROUS REGIONAL AIRPORT 
EXPANSION SHOULD TAKE PLACE 
AIRPORTS LIKE LIVERPOOL WHICH 
COULD ORDER COULD ORDER HE IS GOING ON A BIT TOO LONG 
I WILL PASS HIS QUESTION ON TO THE 
PRIME MINISTER L. WILL SAY TO HIM 
AND THE HOUSE THAT MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIEND THE SECRETARY OF 
STATE FOR TRANSPORT IS KEEPING ALL 
THESE ISSUES UNDER CLOSE REVIEW 
THE GOVERNMENT TALKS MUCH ABOUT 
BRITISHNESS BUT IT IS UNBRITISH TO 
LOCK SOMEONE UP FOR OVER A MONTH 
PURELY ON GROUNDS OF SUSPICION AND 
NOT EVIDENCE GIVEN THE PRECHARGE 
DETENTION PERIOD IN MOST OTHER 
WESTERN DEMOCRACYS IS LESS THAN A 
WEEK CAN THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE 
DO SOMETHING THAT HER ENTIRE HOME 
OFFICE FRONT BENCH HAVE BEEN UNABLE 
TO DO SO FAR AND THAT IS EXPLAIN 
WHAT IS SO UNIQUE ABOUT THE BRITISH 
THAT WE NEED OVER A MONTH 
WELL V. Y. TO START BY SAYING THAT I 
THINK THAT THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMPARISONS HAVE BEEN SPURIOUS 
THAT WHEN YOU THEY HAVE L. THINK 
YOU ARE COMPARING COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT PROCESSES L. WOULD SAY IN 
RELATION TO WHAT THE PROPOSALS ARE 
THAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS BRINGING TO 
THIS HOUSE AND WHICH EACH MEMBER 
WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE SHORTLY IS THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT IS 
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC ARE 
SAFE AND THEY ARE SAFE FROM 
TERRORISM IT IS ALSO THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS GOVERNMENT 
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT CIVIL 
LIBERTIES AND HUMAN RIGHTS L. DO 
FIND IT VERY IRONIC THAT THE PARTY 
OPPOSITE WHO POR PORTS TO BE 
STRONG ON PUBLIC PROTECTION DOES 
NOT SUPPORT THE MEASURES THAT WE 
ARE PUTTING FORWARD AND WHO 
SUDDENLY DECIDES THEY WANT TO BE 
CONCERNED ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN 
IN FACT THEY WOULD ABOLISH THE 
HUMAN RIGHTS ACT THAT THIS LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT BROUGHT IN 
ONE OF THE LEAST HERALDED BUT MOST 
POPULAR INNISHIVES TAKEN IN SCHOOLS 
IN THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THE FRUIT 
IN SCHOOLS SCHEME OFFERED TO 
INFANT CHILDREN IN SOME SCHOOLS IN 
MY CONSTITUENCY THE SCHOOLS 
VOLUNTARILY EXTEND THAT SCHEME 
BEYOND THE NARROW AGE RAGE COVERED 
WOULD SHE AGREE THE GOVERNMENT 
SHOULD CONSIDER EXTENDING THE RANGE 
OF OFFERING THAT IS MADE AT THE 
MOMENT TO BRING THIS POPULAR SCHEME 
TO THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER 
CHILDREN CHILDREN I THANK MY HONOURABLE FRIEND FOR 
RAISING THIS POINT HE IS RIGHT WE 
INTRODUCED THIS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR NOW ALL 
FOUR TO SIX YEAR OLDS IN PRIMARY 
SCHOOL HAVE FREE FRUIT EVERY DAY 
HE WILL REMEMBER NO DOUBT AS 
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE DO THAT 
WHEN WE FIRST INTRODUCED THIS 
PROPOSAL IT WAS JEERED AT THEY 
CALLED IT THE NANNY STATE WE 
CALL IT IMPROVING CHILDREN'S 
HEALTH HEALTH I WELCOME THE FACT THAT LU SETUS 
WILL NOW BE PRESCRIBED L. WAS 
DISAPPOINTED THAT THE HEALTH 
MINISTER ON MY DEBATE ON DRY MACYOU 
LAR DEGENERATION IT WAS POOR AND 
IS NOT HAVING MUCH DONE ABOUT IT 
GIVEN THE LEAD ORE OF THE HOUSE 
ACCEPTS THE NEED FOR THE RIGHT KIT 
FOR THE RIGHT ASSOCIATE DO WE HAVE 
THE RIGHT KIT FOR DRY MANACULAR 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE IS 
EVIDENCE BASED AN EVIDENCE BASED 
PROCESS FOR NEW DRUGS L. WOULD SAY 
TO HER THAT WHATEVER SHE WOULD LIKE 
TO ACHIEVE IN THE HEALTH SERVICE 
IT CANNOT BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT THE 
EXTRA INVESTMENT NOT ONLY THAT 
LABOUR HAS PUT IN OVER THE LAST TEN 
YEARS BUT IS DETERMINED TO PUT IN 
IN THE FUTURE 
MR. SPEAKER MYSELF AND OTHER 
HONOURABLE FRIENDS HAVE JOINED 
FORCES TO CAMPAIGN FOR FREE 
UNIVERSAL SCHOOL LUNCHES THE DAILY 
MIRROR IS RECOGNISING OUR CAMPAIGN 
RECOGNISING IT WOULD HELP FIGHT 
CHILD OBESETY AND POVERTY DOES MY 
HONOURABLE FRIEND RECOGNISE IT 
WOULD BE A RADICAL POLICY WHICH 
WOULD BENEFIT THE HEALTH AND 
EDUCATION OF MILLIONS OF CHILDREN 
REGARDLESS OF FAMILY INCOME 
I PAY 
TRIBUTE TO MY HONOURABLE FRIEND WHO 
IS A CHAMPION FOR CHILDREN IN HER 
CONSTITUENCY I KNOW SHE HAS BEEN 
PRESSING ON THIS CAMPAIGN AND THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS RESPONDED TO THE 
POINTS SHE HAS RACED AND IS LOOKING 
AT THE RESULTS OF THE PILOT THAT IS 
TAKING PLACE IN HULL WE HAVE 
ACTUALLY INCREASED THE TAKE UP OF 
FREE SCHOOL MALES WE HAVE 
INCREASED THE FOR FREE SCHOOL 
MEALS WE HAVE INCREASED THE 
ELIBILITY FOR FREE SCHOOL MEALS IT 
IS IMPORTANT THAT CHILDREN ONCE A 
DAY HAVE A NOURISHING HOT MEAL 
LAST WEEK PEOPLE IN THE BROADS AREA 
OF NORFOLK WERE CONFRONTED BY A 
REPORT FROM NATURAL ENGLAND WHICH 
PROPOSED THE ABANDONMENT OF SIX 
VILLAGES TO THE SEA THE IMMEDIATE 
IMPLICATIONS THAT IT IS WITHOUT ANY 
COMPENSATION TO THOSE AFFECTED CAN 
THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE OFFER ANY 
REASURANCE TO THOSE COMMUNITYS THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT WILL DEFEND THIS 
COASTLINE 
I AM AWARE OF THE ISSUES COASTLINE HE RAISES AND THE QUESTION OF SEA 
DEFENCES IN THE PART OF THE WORLD 
WHICH HE REPRESENTS IS VERY 
IMPORTANT INDEED MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIEND THE SECRETARY OF 
STATE FOR DEFRA IS WORKING WITH THE 
ENVIRONMENT AGENCY AND WILL WORK 
WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND LOCAL 
MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT IN THAT AREA 
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT 
WAY FORWARD 
WILL THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE JOIN 
ME IN WELCOMING THE EXTENSION 
YESTERDAY OF FREE BUS PASSES ACROSS 
ENGLAND ALSO THE VERY WELCOME 
EXTRA GOVERNMENT FUNDING TO LOCAL 
COUNCILS TO PAY FOR IT 
I WILL CERTAINLY WELCOME THE 
EXTENSION OF FREE BUS PASSES AND 
TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY TWO 
THINGS FIRSTLY PEOPLE WHO ARE 
OVER SIXTY WANT TO BE GETTING OUT AND 
ABOUT TO SEE THEIR FRIENDS AND 
THEIR FAMILY AND SOCIALISING AND 
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT INDEED THAT 
THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO 
ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND 
THAT WE REQUIRED LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
TO INTRODUCE HALF PRICE FATHERS FOR 
PENSIONERS AND DISABLED HALF 
PRICE FARES FOR PENSIONERS AND 
DISABLED PEOPLE WE REQUIRED LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES TO DO FREE FARES FOR 
PENSIONERS AND DISABLED PEOPLE 
FROM TODAY PENSIONERS AND DISABLED 
PEOPLE WHENEVER THEY ARE WILL BE 
ABLE TO TRAVEL FREE 
WHEN THE 
GOVERNMENT CHANGED THE EMPHASIS 
FROM THE RETAIL PRICE INDEX TO 
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX WERE THEY 
AWARE THEIR NEW SHARE OF INDEX 
WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN 
THE HIGHER ONE WHAT DOES SHE SAY 
TO THE PENSIONERS WHO SUFFER 
BECAUSE OF IT 
I WILL ASK THE 
CHANCELLOR TO WRITE TO HIM ON THAT 
VERY POINT 
ORDER 
IT WAS THE HARMAN AND HAIG SHOW 
THAT WENT ON 
THE JOISTING ABOUT CLOTHES BECAUSE 
OF MS. HARMAN'S FLAK JACKET IN A 
CONSTITUENCY VINCE CABLE ONE OF 
THE DAILY POLITICS MOST FAVOUR 
POLITICIANS GOT SHOT DOWN IN HIS 
PRIME HE DARED TO ASK A QUESTION 
THAT INVOLVED HER MAJESTY THE 
SPEAKER POINTED OUT YOU ARE NOT 
ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT HER MAJESTY 
IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BY 
CONVENTION HE DIDN'T GET ANY 
FURTHER THAN THAT HE MUST BE 
REGRETTING IT LICKING HIS WOUNDS 
AS WE SPEAK WE WILL HEAR FROM OUR 
PANEL IN MOMENT FIRST WE WILL 
HEAR FROM YOU WHAT ARE THE E. 
MAILERS SAYING 
PEOPLE ARE SPLIT OVER WHETHER OR 
NOT HARRIET HARMAN OR WILLIAM HAGUE 
GOT THE THE BEST OF THAT FOR 
EXAMPLE TIM REID SAYS SACK GORDON 
BROWN AND MAKE HARRIET HARMAN PRIME 
MINISTER HILARY KING TELL THE 
LADY WHEN SHE IS IN HOLE TO 
STOPDICTING DIGGING 
VERY MUCH DECIDED ON WHERE THEY 
STAND ON WHETHER OR NOT LABOUR IS 
OUT OF TOUCH A. N. N. SAYS TODAY I I 
RECEIVED MY TEACHERS PENSION TWELVE 
LESS EACH MONTH WITH THE INCREASES 
ON RATE AND PETROL AND I'M ON THE 
POVERTY LINE WHY DOESN'T HARRIET 
HARMAN REALISE HOW MUCH THE LABOUR 
PARTY HIT THE LESS WELL OFF DAVID 
SAYS HARRIET HARMAN'S COMMENTS 
SUGGESTING WE PAY LESS TAX IS 
INCREDIBLE I WOULD LAUGH BUT I'M 
IN SHOCK DEL SAYS I HAVE WORKED 
OUT OUT THAT I WILL BE BE NINETY TWO PENCE 
WORSE OFF WEEK THANKS TO THE 
SCRAPPING OF THE TEN PENCE RATE 
THANK YOU LABOUR I'M GLOD YOU ARE 
ON THE SIDE OF THE WORKING CLASS 
THIS E. MAILER SAYS I WONDER HOW 
MANY WOMEN ARE DISAPPOINTED NICK 
CLEGG DIDN'T TURN UP TODAY I'M I'M NOT A WOMAN AND I'M DISAPPOINTED 
MR. HAIG CHOSE TO GO ON TAX AND THE 
ECONOMY AND SO ON AND LIVING 
STANDARDS OF ORDINARY PEOPLE 
THIS IS MOVING INTO THE CENTRE 
STAGE OF BRITISH POLITICS POLITICS 
AGAIN ISN'T 
HE GOT THE BETTER OF 
HER ON THOSE ISSUES FOUR OR FIVE 
QUESTIONS ON THAT LINE SHE WAS 
GOOD ON THE GAGS PRABLE GOT THE 
PROBABLY GOT THE BETTER OF HIM 
THERE THERE SHE WAS SHAKY ON SOME OF THAT THIS 
IDEA THAT THIS LINE THAT THE 
COUNTRY WAS WORSE TAXED UNDER THE 
CONSERVATIVES CONSERVATIVES IS 
QUESTIONABLE AND THERE ARE TOO MANY 
PREPARED ANSWERS AND THIS IS AN 
ABHAVE YOU SAID LINE OF ATTACK FOR 
THE OPPOSITION 
IT IS A STRANGE THING THAT HAS 
HAPPENED UNDER LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
IS IT NOT THAT THE STARTING 
THERE IS POVERTY TRAP PROBLEM IN 
THIS COUNTRY IF YOU'RE LOW PAID 
AND YOU EARN A LIT MORE YOU LOSE 
SO MANY OF YOUR BENEFITS THAT YOU 
CAN END UP WORSE OFF THAT WAS THE 
REASON FOR THE TEN PER CENT STARTING RATE 
SO WHY WOULD LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
DOUBLE THAT TO TWENTY PER CENT 
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS THE 
INTERACTION OF THAT WITH THE TAX 
CREDIT REGIME WHICH IS KEY AND 
CENTRAL AND THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE 
NEED TO TO RECOGNISE THAT PEOPLE 
AREN'T TAKING UP WHERE THEY CAN THE 
TAX CREDITS OR THE OTHER CREDITS 
SUFFICIENTLY AND 
THE INTER 
PLAY BETWEEN THOSE THAT MEANS MEANS 
GORDON WHEN HE SAYS I DON'T THINK 
IT IS THE FIVE MILLION ODD THAT 
SUFFER FROM THE TEN PENCE GOING 
THE TEN PENCE WAS THERE AND WORK AS 
AND WHEN THE OTHER TAX CREDITS COME 
IN THEY ARE THERE TO REPLACE THEM 
BUT THERE IS A. 
WHEN THE TAX RATE 
WAS DOUBLED WHICH IS THE 
GOVERNMENT DOUBLED THE STARTING 
RATE OF TAX WHEN THAT WAS 
THEY TOOK AWAY THE TEN PENCE 
YOU USE TODAY PAY TEN PER CENT YOU NOW PAY 
TWENTY PER CENT TWENTY PER CENT AT THE SAME TIME THE TREASURY OWN 
RED BOOK WHICH ANORAKS LIKE ME GO 
THROUGH IN DETAIL SHOW THE 
GOVERNMENT ASSUMED THERE WOULD BE 
NO BIGGER A TAKE UP RATE OF TAX 
CREDITS THAN THERE HAD WHEN THERE 
WAS A TEN PER CENT RATE 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MAKE 
ASSUMPTIONS AT THE THE RED BOOK 
STAGE YOU HAVE GOT TO PUBLISH 
SOMETHING 
SURELY IF YOU ARE SOMETHING HITTING THE LOWEST EARNERS IN THE 
COUNTRY YOU WOULD MAKE SURE THAT 
THE TAKE UP OF TAX CREDITS WAS MUCH 
HIGHER AND YOU WOULD REFLECT THAT 
IN DWRUR CALCULATION YOUR 
CALCULATIONS CALCULATIONS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO POCKET WHAT 
YOU THINK IS THE OUTCONE OF A 
CAMPAIGN TO INCREASE THE TAKE UP 
THEY WOULD BE OVER US 
YOU SHOULD OF ASSUMED EXTRA 
SPENDING IN THE HOPE THAT AS POORER 
PEOPLE HAD TO PAY A HIGHER STARTING 
RATE OF TAX THEY WOULD APPLY FOR 
TAX CREDITS YOUR GOVERNMENT 
ASSUMED THEY WOULDN'T 
BUT THEY WILL IF THE CAMPAIGNS GO 
RIGHT YOU CAN'T HAVE CAMPAIGN 
FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE UP TAX CREDIT 
AND PUT THAT IN THE RED BOOK AT THE 
START OF THE PROCESS 
THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE WHO AREN'T 
EARNING THEIR INCOME WHO DON GET 
THE TAX CREDITS THE TAX CREDITS 
WOULD REDUCE THIS FIVE MILLION IF 
IF ENOUGH OF THEM TOOK IT UP BUT 
THEY WON'T WHAT I'M SURPRISED BY 
THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
FOR TWELVE MONTHS THIS IS GORDON 
BROWN'S LAST BUDGET 
YOUR PARTY HAS BEEN SLOW ON GETTING 
INTO IT 
I THINK WE THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE CHANGED 
TAX GORDON HAD HIS TAX CUTTING 
BUDGET AND WITHIN TWO DAYS PEOPLE 
SAID THIS ISN'T TAX CUTTING HE GOT 
INTO THE SAME ARGUMENTS WHEN PEOPLE 
SAID YOU PUT THE TAX UP ON FIVE 
MILLION LOW EARNING PEOPLE TWELVE 
MONTHS LATER DIFFERENT CHANCELLOR 
THEY HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT ALL 
THEY CAN DO ABOUT NON DOMS AND 
BACKED DOWN LIKE CRAZE THEY HAVE 
BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN 
DO ABOUT CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND 
BACKING DOWN RIGHTLY IN THAT CASE 
GORDON IS ABOLISHING THE TWENTY PENCE 
RATE GO AHEAD IT IT WOULDN'T OF 
COST THEM MUCH 
OSBORNE WILL STICK TO THE SPENDING 
LIMITS NOTHING ABOUT WHAT WILL BE 
SPENT ON TAX CREDITS OR THE TAX 
BREAKS GETTING ON TO THIS TERRY 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TORY 
POSITION IS GOING TO BE 
THAT'S A HARRIET HARMAN TYPE 
INTERVENTION 
TAX CREDITS 
I HOPE WE HIT THE 
SPENDING LIMITS 
I SUPPORT WHAT WE HAVE SAID ON THE 
SPENDING LIMITS IF THE LABOUR 
PARTY CAN DELIVER THEIR NEW 
SPENDING LIMITS I'M A MONKEY'S 
UNCLE COMPARED WITH THE WAY THEY 
HAVE BEEN INFLATING 
CAN I JUST 
INTRUDE INTO THIS PRIVATE ARGUMENT 
BECAUSE I HAVE LOST IT ALREADY 
MICHAEL CRICK WAS IT NOT TRUE THERE 
WAS SERIOUS UNREST AT THE MEETINGS 
OF LABOUR BACKBENCHES THAT THE 
PRIME MINISTER ADDRESSED THEY ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT TAX AND UTILITY 
BILLS 
AS SOMEBODY WHO WASN'T THERE BILLS CERTAINLY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT 
NIGGLES WERE RAISED POST OFFICE 
CLOSURES THE FORTY TWO DAY THING THE 
IMPRESSION I GET IS THAT GORDON 
BROWN DIDN'T MANAGE TO PERSUADE 
THEM TO INSPIRE THEM IN THE WAY 
THAT THAT TONY BLAIR OFTEN DID 
BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS EVEN WHEN THEY 
DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM THERE IS A 
LOT OF AND CLEARLY WITH THE LOCAL 
ELECTION COMING UP THERE ARE 
CONSIDERABLE WORRIES 
WHILE WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING 
BRITISH POLITICS THERE HAS BEEN 
DEVELOPMENT IN IRISH POLITICS 
BERTIE AHERN THE IRISH PRIME 
MINISTER THE TAOISEACH WAS FORCE 
TODAY QUIT THIS MORNING AS THE 
DEEPENING SCANDAL OVER HIS FINANCES 
THREATEN THE FUTURE OF HIS 
COALITION GOVERNMENT HE WILL NOT 
RESIGN UNTIL THE SIXTH 
AFTER 
MAKING HISTORIC ADDRESS TO BOTH 
HOUSES IN THE U. S. THE BRITISH PRIME 
MINISTER WHO IS IN BUCHAREST SAYS 
HE IS WITH GREAT REGRET THAT HE HE 
HEARD THE NEWS OF MR. AHERN'S 
DECISION TO STAND DOWN HE SAYS HE 
HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDING PRIME 
MINISTER MINISTER HE WAS PART OF THE PEACE PROCESS 
A HUGE LOSS YOU WILL REMEMBER IN 
THE EIGHTIES FITS GERALD AND HAUY AND 
PEOPLE WERE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT 
WOULD FOLLOW THEM AND BERTIE AHERN 
STEPPED IN AND HAS BEEN 
QUINTESSENTIALLE TO THE SUCCESS OF 
THE PEACE PROCESS AND A HUGE LOSS 
FOR THE REPUBLIC'S POLITICS AND FOR 
THE EUROPEAN UNION'S POLITICS 
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN A ALLY OF THE 
U. K. IN EUROPEAN MATTERS AS WELL 
IT IS A HUGE LOSS 
WE HAVE TO LEAVE 
IT THERE 
IN A MOMENT WE WILL BE JOINED BY 
THE VIOLINIST TASMIN LITTLE 
IT IS TIME WE HAD CULTURE ON THIS 
PROGRAMME PROGRAMME FIRST IT IS TIME TO PUT YOU OUT 
YOUR MISERY AND GIVE YOU THE ANSWER 
TO GUESS THE YEAR 
RHODESIA BECOMING THE INDEPENDENT 
STATE OF ZIMBABWE DO YOU REMEMBER 
WHEN IT HAPPENED FIRST OF ALL 
LET'S SEE IF YOU WERE RIGHT 
RHODESIA BECOMES INDEPENDENT 
ZIMBABWE IN FIFTEEN MINUTES TIME 
NINETEEN EIGHTY OUR GUESTS WERE NOT ACCURATE 
ON THAT 
TONE TONE 
TONY MCNULTY GOT IT RIGHT I GUESS 
THAT MEANS MR. CLARKE GOT IT WRONG 
NINETEEN EIGHTY MR. MUGABE BECOMING THE FIRST 
LEADER OF AN INDEPENDENT ZIMBABWE 
YOU GET TO PICK THE WINNER 
RIGHT 
RIGHT RIGHT THE WINNER IS BRIAN SYNAI OF LONDON 
WHEN OUR POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT 
MUSIC IT IS USUALLY POP MUSIC 
TONY BLAIR WAS A WANNABEE ROCK STAR 
GORDON BROWN ROCKS ALONG TO THE 
ARCTIC MONKEYS AND DAVID CAMERON 
HE PLAYS THE KILLERS AND THE SMITHS 
WHY DO THEY NOT TALK ABOUT THE 
CLASSICS DO THEY THINK THEY ARE 
UNCOOL TASMIN LITTLE SAYS THIS IS 
TYPICAL OF OUR ATTITUDE TO 
CLASSICAL MUSIC AND THE REASON WHY 
FEWER AND FEWER SCHOOLCHILDREN ARE 
ENGAGING IN ITMENT HERE SHE IS 
TAKING HER CLASSICAL CAUSE TO THE 
CLASSROOM AND AND 
THESE CHILDREN ARE ONLY FIVE FIVE 
YEARS OLD THEY ARE AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS 
AND YET HERE THEY ARE SITTING AND 
REALLY LISTENING TO CLASSICAL MUSIC 
MOST PARENTS WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO 
HAVE MUSIC IN THEIR LIVES WHETHER 
IT IS PLAYING AN INSTRUMENT 
SINGING OR LISTENING AND THE 
GOVERNMENT SEEM TO WANT THAT TOO 
THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS WELL KNOWN 
THAT MUSIC PARTICULARLY CLASSICAL 
MUSIC BRINGS MORE THAN JUST 
FLEETING ENJOYMENT 
IT DEVELOPS THE BRAIN IT UNLOCKS 
CREATIVE TALENT AND CAN GIVE THE 
SHYEST UNDER ACHIEVER CONFIDENCE 
YOU WANT A VIOLIN TOO 
IT CUTS ACROSS SOCIAL SOCIAL SOCIAL 
BOUNDARIES TAKE VENEZUELA WHERE 
THOUSANDS OF STREET KIDS HAVE HAD 
THEIR LIVES TURNED AROUND 
CLASSICAL MUSIC CAN BE A FORCE FOR 
GOOD GOOD THE GOVERNMENT HAVE PLEDGED 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS FOR SCHOOL MUSIC 
IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS THAT'S 
GREAT BUT WILL IT REVERSE THE 
DECLINE IN LEARNING AND LISTENING 
TO CLASSICAL MUSIC THAT HAPPENED 
OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS DESPITE 
PREVIOUSLY CAMPAIGNS AND INJECTIONS 
OF KARK THE INSTITUTE OF INSTITUTE 
OF INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SAYS 
FEWER PEOPLE RECEIVE MUSIC 
EDUCATION EDUCATION WHEN YOUNGSTERS PLAY MORE ARE 
FAVOURING GUITAR AND DRUMS OVER 
VIOLINS AND PIANO WHAT'S BEHIND 
THE TREND LEARNING TO SING OR PLAY 
A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT IS HARD AND 
TAKES TIME AND IT IS MORE DEMANDING 
THAN EMULATING YOUR FAVOURITE ROCK 
BAND BAND IT IS GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN MONEY 
TO TURN OUR YOUNGSTERS ON TO 
CLASSICAL MUSIC WE NEED PROPERLY 
TRAINED MUSIC TEACHERS IN OUR 
SCHOOLS COLLABORATING WITH CONCERT 
HALLS LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND 
MUSICIANS SO IT IS MORE PRACTICAL 
AND ENJOYABLE TO ATTEND LIVE EVENTS 
AND WE NEED TO CHALLENGE THE 
PERCEPTION THAT CLASSICAL MUSIC IS 
ELITIST 
LET'S HARNESS THE POWER OF MUSIC IN 
SCHOOLS AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES IT 
CHANGED MY WORLD AND IT COULD 
CHANGE THE LIVES OF SO MANY OTHERS 
I'M PLEASE TODAY SAY THAT TASMIN 
LITTLE JOINS ME NOW 
YOU MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
HARNESSING THE POWER OF MUSIC IT 
IS CLASSICAL WHAT DOES CLASSICAL 
GIVE US THAT POP MUSIC CAN'T THERE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE PERHAPS IT IS 
CONTROVERSIAL TO SAY THIS 
CLASSICAL MUSIC IS SO PROFOUND F. 
YOU THINK OF CERTAIN POP SONGS 
THEY HAVE A TREND AND THEN YOU MOVE 
ON TO THE NEXT POP SONG AND THEN 
THE NEXT CLASSICAL MUSIC PEOPLE 
ARE STILL ENJOYING WORKS WHICH WERE 
WRITTEN OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
IN YOUR 
VIEW IT IS NOT JUST KIDS AT SCHOOL 
SHOULD LEARN ABOUT MUSIC PER SE IT 
IS ABOUT SPECIFICALLY THEY GET MORE 
OUT OF LEARNING THE CLASSICS I I DON'T RULE OUT ALL OTHER VARIETIES 
OF MUSIC WHAT WE WANT IS NOT TO I. G. 
NOR CLASSICAL MUSIC IN WHAT IS 
PERCEIVED TO BE A QUICKER AND MORE 
COOL OPTION 
WE ARE DELUGED IN OUR 
CULTURE WITH THINGS LIKE THE X. X. 
FACTOR AND POPPAL LANT SHOWS HOW 
DO YOU SINGLE HANDEDLY CHANGE THAT 
CULTURE 
EARLIER THIS YEAR I MADE CULTURE MY NEWEST RECORDING AVAILABLE FOR 
FREE ON MY WEBSITE SINCE IT WAS 
MADE AVAILABLE I'VE HAD OVER 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND VISITORS GLOBALLY ON MY 
WEBSITE IT IS ONE OF THE MOST 
VISITED WEBSITES IN THE WORLD 
WHICH GOES TO SHOW THERE IS A 
TREMENDOUS HUNGER FOR CLASSICAL 
MUSIC I THINK PART OF THE IDEA IS 
JUST TO MAKE PEOPLE WAKE UP TO IT 
AND NOT SAY WELL O. K. THIS IS IN THE 
PAST IT IS NOT RELEVANT ANY MORE 
IT IS STILL RELEVANT L. AM GOING 
INTO COMMUNITIES AND INTO SCHOOLS 
AS PART OF MY PROJECT L. HAVE HAD 
HUNDREDS OF LETTERS AND INVITATIONS 
SO I WILL SPEND A LOT OF TIME GOING 
TO VARIOUS PLACES L. HAD AN 
EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE LAST 
FRIDAY I WEPT TO A HOSTEL FOR 
HOMELESS PEOPLE AND PLAYED TO THIRTY 
RESIDENTS ONE OF THE RESIDENTS I 
SPOKE TO BEFORE HAND I ASKED SHE 
WAS COMING SHE SAID I HAVE TO GO 
OUT SHE WAS THE FIRST TO GET UP 
AND START DANCING AT THE END SHE 
IS ON CAMERA BECAUSE I AM BEING 
FILMED FOR THE SOUTH BANK SHOW SHE 
IS ON CAMERA BREAKING DOWN SAYING 
IT IS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAS BEEN 
IN TOUCH WITH HER EMOTIONS FOR 
YEARS THAT IS THE PROFOUND EFFECT 
KIT HAVE 
YOU ARE WELL KNOWN FOR 
BEING A JAZZ FAN WAS THAT AN 
INTEREST CULTIVATED AT SCHOOL 
SCHOOL MUSIC TEACHING IN MY DAY IF 
YOU WERE AT A GOOD SCHOOL WAS 
DREADFUL I PICKED UP MY TASTE FOR 
JAZZ AS A TEEN IDGEER IN THE BARS 
IN NOTTINGHAM L. HAD ROW WHEN I 
WAS SECRETARY OF STATE FOR 
EDUCATION WE INTRODUCED THE MUSIC 
CURRICULUM THE LEFT WING 
EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENT ENSURED 
IN MENTION OF CLASSICAL MUSIC 
OCCURRED IN IT SAID THIS IS 
RIDICULOUS IT WAS 
WHY WAS IT 
IT WAS NOT RELEVANT IT WAS ELITIST 
THEY WERE NOT GOING TO TEACH IT 
THEY TRIED TO CHEER ME UP SAYING 
THERE IS REFERENCES TO JAZZ IN HERE 
THERE ARE SIX REFERENCES TO REGGAE 
IT WAS FASHIONABLE IT WAS SEEN AS 
THE MUSIC AS DEAD WHITE EUROPEANS 
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TEACH ALL THEY 
WANTED TO DO WAS TEACH DUMBED DOWN 
FASHIONABLE POP MUSIC 
THINGS HAVE 
MOVED ON 
GOOD LUCK 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
PROVIDED THREE HUNDRED MILLION TO ENABLE 
EVERY CHILD TO LEARN AN INSTRUMENT 
FOR ONE YEAR IN PRIMARY HAS TASMIN 
GOT A POINT YOU SHOULD BE AS 
PRESCRIPTIVE TO SAY IT SHOULD BE 
AVY LIN AS OPPOSED TO A GUITAR 
MAKE ROOM FOR CLASSICAL AS WELL AS 
OTHERS I AM PLEASED THAT THE SORT 
OF NONSENSE KEN REFERS TO NOT SAYS 
REFERS TO ABOUT ELITEISM AND THAT 
IT IS COMPLETE GARBAGE L. RECOGNISE 
AND FULLY ACCEPT I DON'T LIKE JAZZ 
AS IT HAPPENS I AM ALMOST INFECTED 
BY HIM WHEN HE DOES IT ON THE RADIO 
THERE CAN BE THE SAME ENTHUSIASM 
ABOUT CLASSICAL MUSIC IT CAN BE 
USED IN WAYS THAT A FLIPANT POP 
PIECE COULD BE SO LET'S HAVE 
LET'S HAVE ALL OF IT PERHAPS NOT 
JAZZ IN SCHOOL THAT MIGHT BE 
UNFAIR ON THE CHILDREN 
THE PROBLEM IS AT JUST ONE YEAR OF 
TRAINING FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILD 
IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH AND THE 
SITUATION IS YOU ACTUALLY NEED 
CONSISTENT PERIOD IN ORDER TO GET 
ANYWHERE WITH CLASSICAL MUSIC IT 
PUTS LOT OF PEOPLE OFF YOU YOU CANNOT FORCE KIDS TO LEARN THEVY 
LIN AS OPPOSED TO THE GUITAR L. 
UNDERSTAND THE GUITAR IS MORE 
POPULAR THE THING YOU CAN DO IS 
POPULAR THE THING YOU CAN DO IS GO INTO SCHOOLS AND PLAY THEVY LIN 
SOMEBODY ON THE VIDEO SAID THE 
VIOLIN WHEN YOU ARE THERE IN FRONT 
OF THEM THE POWER OF THE MUSIC IS 
OBVIOUS 
A YEAR FOR EVERY CHILD IS OBVIOUS NOT ABOUT TEACHING THEM EVERYTHING 
YOU CAN IT IS ABOUT GIVING THEM AN 
ENTRAY INTO MUSIC AND HOPEFULLY 
THEY WILL TAKE UP THE MUSIC YOU YOU ARE GOING TO PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE 
YOUR MOUTH IS YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT 
CONSISTENT YOU CANNOT SAY ONE YEAR 
ONE YEAR OF FRUIT EATING IS GOING 
TO BE ENOUGH YOU HAVE TO STICK 
WITH IT 
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT TO OUR 
ATTENTION WHEN WE WERE TALKING 
THERE SOME BREAKING NEWS ON 
ZIMBABWE WE ARE GETTING REPORTS 
FROM THAT COUNTRY THAT THE 
OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC 
CHANGE THE M. D. C. HAS DECLARED ITS 
LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI THE 
RIGHTFUL WINNER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION BASED ON ITS OWN TALLY OF 
THE WEEKEND POLLS T. OPPOSITION 
LEADER SAID HE WOULD ONLY DECLARE 
HIMSELF LEADER WHEN THE OFFICIAL 
RESULTS SHOWED THAT SO THERE HAS 
BEEN QUITE AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT 
THERE IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT MR. 
MUGABE HAS GONE BY ANY MEANS A 
DEVELOPMENT OF WHICH WE WILL HAVE 
MORE ON THE B. B. C. LUNCH TIME NEWS 
NOW THE ENVIRONMENT SECRETARY HAS 
TODAY ANNOUNCED AN EXPANDED PACKAGE 
TO MAKE HOUSEHOLDERS MAKE THEIR 
HOMES MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT ENERGY 
COMPANIES WILL SPEND MORE TO HELP 
PEOPLE CUT ENERGY CONSUMPTION MR. 
BENN SAYS DOING SO WOULD NOT ONLY 
FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE BUT HELP 
PEOPLE SAVE ON THEIR FUEL BILLS IS 
THAT THE BEST WAY TO COMBAT THESE 
SPIRALLING COSTS OF HEATING YOUR 
HOME WE HAVE FOUND OUT WHETHER 
PEOPLE WANT MORE SCHEMES LIKE THIS 
OR WHETHER THEY WOULD LIKE CHEAPER 
ENERGY 
I THINK CHEAPER ENERGY ENERGY BILLS THAT IS EASIER FOR MOST 
PEOPLE 
NOT INTERESTED IN MAKING IT PEOPLE ENERGY EFFICIENT 
I THINK A LOT OF 
PEOPLE HAVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY FOR 
MOST PEOPLE CHEAPER ENERGY BILLS 
CHEAPER MUCH CHEAPER 
I THINK 
SCHEMES THAT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO 
LIVE IN A MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY 
SUSTAINABLE WAY ARE REALLY GOOD L. 
WOULD SUPPORT THOSE 
I THINK I WILL 
TAKE THE CHEAP ENERGY BILL 
WHY IS 
THAT 
GRATIFYATION UP FRONT RATHER THAT THAN 
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY THAN ANYWHERE 
THERE IS A BIT OF THAT ANYWHERE EITHER IS A GOOD CHOICE PEOPLE 
WOULD SAY CASH NOT GOING OUT OF 
HAND 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS HAND AVAILABLE 
I AM VAGUELY AWARE THAT AVAILABLE MOST COUNCILS HAVE SCHEMED THAT 
SCHEMES THAT IS ONE OF THE 
PROBLEMS THEY ARE NOT WELL 
PUBLICISED 
I THINK THEY ARE GOOD PUBLICISED ENERGY SHOULD BE CHEAPER 
ABSOLUTELY 
YOU WANT BOTH YOU NEED ABSOLUTELY SOME BALANCE IN THERE 
WOULD YOU 
DO YOU KNOW ANY OF THESE SCHEMES I I HEARD ONE THE OTHER DAY BUT I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS L. DON'T KNOW 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
IT IS A GOOD 
IDEA FOR PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD 
IT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR 
INSULATION IT IS A GOOD USE OF 
PUBLIC MONEY TO DO THAT GIVEN WE 
ALL SHARE THE SAME PLANET 
YOU KNOW 
ALL ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE OFFERING 
GIVEN I AM IN AN INCOME BRACKET 
WHICH MEANS I KNOW LITTLE IT 
MY EX WIFE GOT AN AWFUL LOT FROM IT 
THAT IS GOOD FOR HER 
THERE WE GO 
SOME HONESTY A WINDOW INTO HIS 
WORLD WE PROBABLY KNOW ENOUGH 
ABOUT YOU SIR ALREADY WELCOME TO 
THE DAILY POLITICS LET'S GO TO THE 
POINT WHAT IS THE SINGLE MOST 
IMPORTANT THING PEOPLE SHOULD DO TO 
THEIR HOMES TO REDUCE THEIR FUEL 
ENERGY CONSUMPTION 
TWO THINGS 
FIRST TO MAKE SURE ALL THE MEASURES 
THAT INSULATE THE HOME LAG THE 
BOILER MAKE SURE APPLIANCES WHICH 
ARE ENERGY EFFICIENT SHOULD BE DONE 
SERT THE ANNOUNCEMENT THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE IS ANNOUNCING 
TODAY WE SHOULD REMEMBER YOU PAY 
THAT THROUGH YOUR BILL IT IS NOT 
PUBLIC MONEY IT IS NOT A GIFT FROM 
THE SUPPLIER WE NEED A CULTURE 
CHANGE AS WELL WE NEED PEOPLE TO 
THINK ABOUT HOW THEY CONSUME ENERGY 
TO HAVE BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT 
THE WAY THEY USE ENERGY AND TO 
VALUE DATE THE CHANGES THEY CAN 
MAKE MEASURES IN THE HOME AND 
PERSONAL CHANGES AS WELL 
I HAVE LOST COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF 
TIMES WE HAVE DONE ANNOUNCEMENTS IN 
THIS PROGRAMME OF SOME OTHER 
FURTHER MOVE THE GOVERNMENT IS 
TAKING TO INSULATE OUR HOMES 
IN THE SUBJECT THE VAST SUM OF THIRTY FIVE 
MILLION WAS ADDED TO HOME 
INSULATION IS THERE ANY INDICATION 
THAT ANY OF THESE DRIP DRIP 
MEASURES IS MAKING ANY REAL IMPACT 
ON OUR ENERGY CONSUMPTION 
MOST OF 
THE PROGRAMMES THAT EXIST ARE 
CARBON ABATEMENT PROCESSES THEY 
ARE TO STOP THE EMITTING OF 
UNNECESSARY CARBON THE BIG ISSUE 
IT WAS ADDRESSED FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IN THE BUDGET IS HELPING THOSE WHO 
CANNOT AFFORD TO HEAT THEIR HOMES 
THAT IS DIFFERENT MATTER 
UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT 
TOO THAT IS THE FUEL POVERTY 
PROBLEM WITH WINTER THAT IS NOT 
WHEN WE HAVE DISCUSSED THAT IT IS 
VERY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY FOR 
OLDER PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD 
THEIR BILLS OUR SUBJECT TODAY IS 
HOW DO WE STOP IT WE ALL KNOW THAT 
MOST OF OUR HOMES ARE JUST SEEPING 
ENERGY OUT WASTED ALL THE TIME 
WHAT DO WE DO 
ONE OF THE SCHEMES 
HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL IS 
THE WARM FRONT PROGRAMME THAT IS 
ACTUALLY TARGETED AT FUEL POOR 
HOMES YOU ARE SEEING TWO HUNDRED ON 
AVERAGE IN SAVINGS AND COSTS AS 
WELL AS GOOD THERMAL BENEFITS 
THERE ARE THINGS LIKE WARM ZONES TO 
WORK WITH COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE 
YOU TACKLE ISSUES ON STREETS THEY 
ARE THE SUCCESSFUL PROBLEMS 
SERT 
WHAT IS THIS NO ONE HAS A SERT CLUE WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 
SERT IS THE PROGRAMME WHERE EVERY 
CONSUMER PAYS NINETEEN PER FUEL IF YOU 
HAVE GAS AND ELECTRICITY IN YOUR 
HOME YOU ARE PAYING FORTY YOU PAY 
THAT THROUGH YOUR BILL THE 
SUPPLIERS OFFER RANGE OF ENERGY 
EFFICIENCY PROGRAMME WHICH YOU CAN 
TAKE UP THERE IS SOME SIGNS THESE 
ARE MAKING SOME GOOD IN ROADS THE 
PROBLEM IS IT IS BELOW HANGING 
FRUIT A LOT OF LIGHT BULBS LOFT 
INSULATION WE ARE NOT SEEING IT AS 
EFFICIENT FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT 
MOST THAT IS THE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT 
AFFORD TO HEAT THEIR HOMES THE THE PROBLEM IS PEOPLE WANT CHEAPER 
BILLS PARTICULARLY THE POOR AND 
THE CHEAP TER BILLS THE MORE ENERGY 
WE ARE CONSUMING 
YOU RECOGNISE THE 
FUEL POOR ARE NOT THOSE WITH THE 
HIGH CARBON FOOTPRINT THEY HAVE A 
LOW ONE 
I AM TALKING ABOUT YOU AND 
ME 
OF COURSE YOU AND ME NEED IT ME THE KEY THING THE COMPETITIVE 
MARKET HAS NOT OFFERED LOW BILLS 
THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE NEED 
THANK YOU 
THANK YOU TO OUR TWO GUESTS YOU 
DID VERY WELL COME BACK AND SEE US 
WE WILL BE BACK TOMORROW AT NOON 
WITH ALL THE BIG POLITICAL STORIES 
OF THE DAY A FORMER POLICEMAN AND 
CANDIDATE FOR LONDON MAJOR BRIAN 
PADDICK WILL BE ON THE SHOW TAS 
MINUTE LITTLE WILL PLAY US OUT 
TASMIN LITTLE WILL PLAY US OUT
