SO I HAVE SUMMONED SIXTEEN OF MY FINEST WARRIORS 
TO A LAND FAR TO THE EAST WHERE THEY MUST UNDERGO MANY TRIALS 
TO FIND THE MAGICAL WATERS THAT CAN BREAK THIS SPELL 
BUT MY OLD ENEMY HAS FOLLOWED ME HERE 
AND HE MEANS TO STOP THIS QUEST AT ANY COST 
THE QUEST TO DISCOVER THE SECRET TEMPLE 
THE EAGLES NOW HAVE TWENTY TWO GEMS 
AND STILL MARCH WITH ALL FOUR WARRIORS 
THE PANTHERS SURVIVED THEIR TEST OF STRENGTH 
AT THE SACRIFICE OF EIGHT OF THEIR PRECIOUS JEWELS 
THEY DECIDED TO BRING BACK ARTON AND NOW THEIR TALLY STANDS AT SIXTEEN 
THE TIGERS' PROGRESS CONTINUES TO BE SLOW WITH JUST TWO GEMS ADDED 
THEY HOLD NINE BUT THEY STILL HAVE ALL FOUR OF THEIR WARRIORS 
THE TWO REMAINING WOLVES HOWEVER WERE NEARLY REDUCED TO ONE 
AS THEIR LEADER DESOT WAS LOST AT THE FIELD OF THE DEAD 
BRINGING HIM BACK IN THE TEAM LEAVES THE WOLVES WITH JUST TWO JEWELS 
BOTH LYMEL AND DESOT HAVE BEEN RESCUED BEFORE 
SO AS THEY STRIVE TO INCREASE THEIR PALTRY NUMBER 
IN THE MANY CHALLENGES AHEAD THEY MUST TREAD VERY CAREFULLY 
MARCA YESTERDAY IN THE RIDDLE TRAP YOU LOST TWO JEWELS 
DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE SENT A MORE NIMBLE WARRIOR 
NO BECAUSE YOU NEED SOMEONE 
WHO IS LONG LEGGED AND REALLY GOOD AT JUMPING 
AND I HAVE THE LONGEST LEGS 
JENRO DO YOU THINK MARCA MADE THE RIGHT DECISION 
BY PUTTING HERSELF IN THE RIDDLE TRAP 
YES I DO 
BECAUSE IN THE LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES SHE WAS THE BEST 
AT THAT TYPE OF GAME SO WE ALL VOTED FOR HER IN THE END 
SO YEAH SHE WAS THE BEST FOR IT I THINK JENRO SHOULD HAVE GONE 
COS HE'S THE TALLEST AND HE'S MORE NIMBLE 
I THOUGHT MARCA DID REALLY WELL 
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COPE WITH THAT PRESSURE 
AND JUST TO GET TWO JEWELS WAS REALLY GOOD 
THE WARRIORS WILL BE TESTED NOW 
ON THEIR ACCURACY STRENGTH AGILITY AND LEADERSHIP 
AS THEY FACE THE SIXTH OF THE FOURTEEN TASKS THAT AWAIT THEM 
UNDER THE BURNING SUN OF THIS MYSTERIOUS LAND 
SO LET THE DAY'S CHALLENGES BEGIN 
EAGLES IT IS A GREAT ASSET FOR A WARRIOR TO BE SKILLED WITH WEAPONS 
AND IT IS YOUR ACCURACY WITH A BOW THAT WILL BE ON TRIAL TODAY 
THE JEWELS YOU SEEK WILL DROP TO THE GROUND WHEN YOU HIT THE TARGET 
BUT EACH OF YOU MUST AIM TRUE IF YOU WISH TO GATHER ALL FOUR GEMS 
REMEMBER WHEN THE DRUM SOUNDS 
THE RELENTLESS MARCH OF THE SPIRIT GUARDS BEGINS 
IF THEY COME WITHIN REACH 
YOU MUST ABANDON YOUR BOWS AND FLEE IMMEDIATELY OR SUFFER THEIR WRATH 
SO MAKE READY THE DRUM WILL SOUND WHEN THE FIRST ARROW FIRES 
O. K. WE'VE ONLY GOT TWELVE ARROWS 
SO WE SHOULD EACH START OFF WITH THREE 
AND IF YOU GET IT IN LESS THAN THREE YOU PUT IT BACK IN THE BASKET 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE TAYLAN THEN YOU THEM SAMRA THEN ME 
O. K. IS EVERYONE HAPPY WITH THAT 
WAIT KADYA AS YOU'RE LAST 
YOU REALLY NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE SPIRIT GUARDS 
AND YOU WILL SOUND THE ALARM 
EVERYONE TAKE THREE ARROWS 
SHOOT ONE AT A TIME OR IT WILL WASTE TIME 
YES TAKE THREE ARROWS 
TAYLAN WILL BE FIRST FOR THE EAGLES 
AS YADA SAMRA AND KARDIA LOOK ON 
THE SPIRITS THAT GUARD THIS PLACE 
ARE ALERTED BY ONE SOUND AND ONE SOUND ONLY 
THE SOUND OF THE THRALL BELLS 
BUT THEY WILL NOT BE DISTURBED IF THE TIGERS MOVE WITH CARE 
BUT IF A WARRIOR SHOULD ONCE BECOME ENTANGLED IN THESE THREADS 
THEN THEY WILL AWAKEN AND WHOEVER HAS SHAKEN THE BELLS 
WILL BE PUNISHED FOR THEIR CARELESSNESS 
WHO SHOULD GO THROUGH THIS BIT FIRST 
SOUK COS I DON'T THINK ANY OF US CAN GET THROUGH THAT BIT 
BUT BE CAREFUL THERE'S ALMOST INVISIBLE STRINGS 
BUT THE JEWELS ARE ON THE STRANDS RIGHT NEXT TO THE BELL 
SO DON'T GET THEM DON'T GET THEM COS IF YOU PICK THEM UP 
YOU'LL MOVE IT AND IT WILL JINGLE ARE WE READY GO FOR IT 
CAREFUL THERE'S A BELL RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR SHOULDER O. K. 
CAN YOU TELL ME IF I'M GOING TO HIT ANYTHING BEND YOUR HEAD DOWN 
YOUR FOOT CAREFUL 
YOU'RE FINE SO FAR 
THE TIGERS HAVE COMMENCED THEIR TASK WITH SOHAR 
DOES SHE HAVE THE AGILITY TO LEAD THE WAY 
GO ON GO ON THAT'S IT 
GO ON SOHAR 
THAT'S IT O. K. 
GO FOR IT MARCA 
HADAV YOU WATCH MARCA 
WHICH WAY NOW GUYS 
WHEN MARCA GETS TO THAT POINT THERE YOU START 
STOP SOHAR WAIT TILL MARCA CAN HELP YOU 
IT'S O. K. I CAN SEE WHERE I'M GOING 
O. K. NO DON'T GO FOR IT IT'S TOO DANGEROUS 
THERE ARE HIDDEN STRINGS RIGHT HERE 
SHALL I GO IN THERE BE CAREFUL SOHAR THERE'S ONE RIGHT NEXT TO YOU 
LOOK OUT THERE'S A HIDDEN STRING BE CAREFUL 
WARRIORS THE CHANT YOU HEAR 
IS AS OLD AS THE MOUNTAINS THAT LOOK DOWN ON THIS PARCHED PLACE 
IT IS THE SOUND OF THIS MANTRA THAT KEEPS THESE TREE SPIRITS AT BAY 
TO UNHOOKE THE JEWELS FROM THEIR RESTING PLACE 
THREE OF YOU MUST LIFT THESE ROPES 
BUT THE MOMENT YOU DO THE CHANTING WILL STOP 
AND THE SPIRITS WILL AWAKEN FROM THEIR TRANCE 
YOUR LEADER SONRO WILL GUIDE YOU IN THIS TASK 
FOR IT IS HIS LEADERSHIP THAT IS BEING TESTED TODAY 
IF ANY OF THE ROPES SHOULD TOUCH THE GUARDS 
AS THEY ENCIRCLE THE JEWELS 
THE WARRIOR RESPONSIBLE WILL BE PUNISHED 
WHAT ROPE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO ON 
I'LL GO WITH THAT ONE 
I'LL GO WITH THAT ONE 
I'LL DIRECT YOU WITH LEFT AND RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE WALKING 
AND TIGHTER AND SLACK ARE WE ALL READY YEAH 
GOOD LUCK 
O. K. READY SLOWLY PICK UP 
PICK UP NOW 
THE CHANTING HAS CEASED THE DEMONS WILL WAKE 
THE PANTHERS ARE NOW IN DANGER 
OH YOU ALMOST HAD IT THERE SO CLOSE 
PULL IT TWO HANDS 
LEADERSHIP IS THE KEY HERE 
WILL SONLU'S LEADERSHIP SHINE THROUGH 
GET IN THE MIDDLE 
QUICK GUYS YOU NEED TO GET THIS 
COME ON SLOWLY 
STEADY THE ROPES 
GET IT FLAT YOU WANT IT HOOKED 
WARRIORS THE MIGHT OF THESE STONES AND THE POWER OF THE SUN 
COMBINED IN THIS TASK TO PRODUCE THE JEWELS YOU NOW SEEK 
BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH 
THE STRENGTH IN YOUR ARMS IS ALSO REQUIRED 
TO CARRY THESE BROKEN COLUMNS TO THE HIGHEST POINT 
THERE TO REASSEMBLE THEM AS TWO PROUD TOWERS 
ONCE THIS TASK IS COMPLETE 
THE RAYS OF THE SUN WILL BEAR DOWN ON THESE MAGICAL STONES 
AND THE JEWELS YOU SEEK WILL APPEAR ON THE BARREN ROCKS BELOW 
REMEMBER IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLETE YOUR TOWERS BEFORE THE SECOND DRUM 
YOUR QUEST MAY BE ENDED HERE 
LYMEL AND DESOT OF THE WOLVES HAVE SET A BLISTERING PACE 
THAT WILL BE HARD TO MAINTAIN UNDER THIS BEATING SUN 
COME ON YEADA 
GOOD SHOT 
NEXT PERSON GO GO GO 
TAYLAN FAILED TO SCORE A HIT 
BUT YEADA HAS DONE SO WITH HER FIRST ARROW A LEADER INDEED 
THEY'RE COMING IT'S O. K. WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME 
SAMRA CONCENTRATES HARD WILL HIS ARROWS BE TRUE 
TAKE YOUR TIME TRY AND GET THIS ONE DON'T WORRY 
OH SO CLOSE KARJA YOUR GO 
WE STILL HAVE TWO BOWS DON'T WE 
OOH SO CLOSE TRY IT COME ON 
UNLUCKY JUST TAKE YOUR TIME DON'T WORRY 
WE'VE GOT LOTS OF TIME GUYS YEAH TAKE YOUR TIME 
UNLUCKY 
THERE'S ONE RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR LEFT LEG 
SOHAR AND MARCA ARE PROCEEDING CAUTIOUSLY IN THE THREADS 
HADAV NOW ENTERS THE TASK 
THERE'S A STRING BY YOUR WRIST THERE'S ONE BEHIND YOU 
WHICH IS THE EASIEST WAY THAT WAS WAY TOO CLOSE 
OH THAT WAS WAY TOO CLOSE 
I'M REALLY CLOSE TO A BELL SHALL I GO UNDER THIS 
O. K. 
JENRO TOO HAS JOINED HIS FELLOW TIGERS 
I'M GOING FOR THAT JEWEL ALL RIGHT 
BE REALLY CAREFUL DON'T GET A JEWEL YOU'LL MAKE IT GO 
WE'RE STUCK 
SHALL I GO UNDER THE 
I'M GOING TO GET IT NO 
MARCA IS LOST TO THE SPIRIT GUARDS 
HER AGILITY WAS IN QUESTION 
DON'T DO IT IT'S TOO DANGEROUS IT'S NOT IT IS 
IT'S NOT MAN NO 
AM I HITTING ANYTHING WITH MY FOOT 
NO IT'S NOT I CAN FIT O. K. IF YOU'RE SURE 
I'M CLOSE TO THE END SO AS SOON AS I'M OUT 
I'LL CONCENTRATE ON GETTING YOU TWO OUT 
GUYS I'M OUT 
DESOT AND LYMEL'S PACE HAS SLOWED NOW AS THEY FEEL THE HEAT 
OF THE NOON DAY SUN 
THE SPIRIT GUARD WATCHES AND WAITS AS THE WOLVES LABOUR 
LYMEL HAS PROVED STRONG INDEED BY COMPLETING HER OBELISK FIRST 
COME ON DESOT YOU'RE NEARLY THERE 
THE FOUR TEAMS WILL BE ANXIOUS TO REACH THE CITADEL SATYARANI 
FOR THAT IS WHERE THE QUEST BEGINS IN EARNEST 
THEY MUST BE PATIENT FOR THE TRIALS ARE NOT OVER 
ANY THAT DESIRES TO ENTER THE SECRET TEMPLE 
MUST BE TESTED AND TESTED SURELY 
THEY ARE ALL GOOD WARRIORS 
THAT MAY BE BUT I AM NOT LOOKING FOR GOOD WARRIORS 
I AM LOOKING FOR GREAT ONES 
WARRIORS THAT HAVE THE COURAGE NOT JUST TO CLIMB IN HIGH PLACES 
OR FIRE AN ARROW INTO THE AIR BUT WHO CAN BATTLE WITH ILLUSIONS 
SOLVE THE UNSOLVABLE FIGHT THE FEARS THAT LURK WITHIN THEIR HEARTS 
GREAT WARRIORS CAN DO THIS 
AND TO FIND SUCH A ONE ALL MUST BE TESTED TO THE FULL 
ARE YOUR WARRIORS PREPARED FOR IT THEY ARE SATYARANI I AM CERTAIN 
WE SHALL SEE 
WHO WANTS TO SHOOT LET TAYLAN TRY IT 
YEADA IS STILL ALONE 
IN HAVING HIT A TARGET ACCURACY IS ALL 
O. K. LET'S ROLL THE DICE TAYLAN I THINK YOU SHOULD DO IT O. K. 
WHO IS WILLING TO DO IT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IT 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX 
THAT'S FOUR KARJA 
COME ON KARJA 
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME 
USE ALL YOUR TIME 
OH WELL GUYS 
COME ON LET'S GO 
ANOTHER JEWEL 
YEADA DID IT REALLY WELL 
SHE GOT A TARGET IN THE FIRST TRIAL 
BUT I WAS EXPECTING MORE FROM TAYLAN 
I WAS REALLY UNLUCKY 
I WAS SO CLOSE THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH BUT I'M REALLY GLAD 
THE TEAM WON A JEWEL 
I WAS REALLY NERVOUS AND DIDN'T THINK I'D GET A TARGET 
BUT I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT GOT A JEWEL I WAS SO HAPPY 
JENRO YOU'RE DOING BRILLIANTLY 
YOUR HEAD IS REALLY CLOSE TO THE JEWEL 
HOW WILL THE TIGERS FAIR WITHOUT LEADER MARCA IN THE THRALL THREADS 
CAREFUL THAT'S GOOD 
RIGHT COME OVER HERE 
RIGHT NOW YOU AND ME REALLY NEED TO HELP JENRO WITH HIS 
CAREFUL I THINK I CAN MOVE MY HEAD UNDER THIS 
WELL DONE 
RIGHT WHERE CAN I GO 
WAIT KEEP ON GOING 
KEEP DOING WHAT YOU WERE DOING JUST SHUFFLE ALONG HERE 
THAT MUST'VE BEEN REALLY HARD FOR YOU TO GO LAST 
I HAD TO GO LAST TO SEE WHAT YOU LOT DID 
WELL DONE 
TIGERS A DIFFICULT DECISION NOW LIES BEFORE YOU 
YOUR LEADER MARCA HAS BEEN TAKEN BY THE SPIRIT GUARDS BUT REMEMBER 
SATYARANI ALLOWS THE USE OF EIGHT OF YOUR PRECIOUS JEWELS 
TO BUY HER BACK 
YOU MUST CHOOSE TO KEEP THOSE JEWELS OR BE REUNITED WITH YOUR LEADER 
WELL WE'VE GOT NINE 
BUT IF WE BUY HER BACK WE HAVE ONLY ONE LEFT 
CAN WE AFFORD THAT BUT SHE'S PART OF OUR TEAM AS WELL 
SHALL WE ROLL THE DICE THEN 
O. K. ROLL THE DICE 
O. K. 
EVEN SHE COMES BACK ODD SHE DOESN'T YEAH 
READY READY GO FOR IT 
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS 
I'LL DO IT 
EVENS YEAH MARCA'S COMING BACK 
SO BE IT 
THEN EIGHT JEWELS ARE REQUIRED 
THAT'S THEM ALL 
IT WAS REALLY SCARY BECAUSE I ALMOST RUINED THE CHALLENGE 
AND THEN I PUT MY HEAD UP AND HIT A BELL AND I WAS OUT 
THEN I FOUND MY TEAM HAD ROLLED THE DICE WE DID THE SAME FOR HADAV 
IT ROLLED IN MY FAVOUR AND I'M BACK 
ARTON GET IT DOWN THE MIDDLE 
SONRO AKSU YONRA AND ARTON ARE NO CLOSER TO THEIR GOAL 
SOME LEADERSHIP IS REQUIRED 
ARTON PULL 
QUICKER ARTON MOVE YOURSELF QUICK 
THAT'S IT 
YONRA SLACK A BIT SLACK A BIT 
OH COME ON I HAD THAT THERE 
STOP MOVING ABOUT SLACK A BIT MORE PULL IN ARTON 
ARTON PULL 
AKSU PULL IT IN A BIT 
OH AKSU OH NEARLY NOT GOT IT YET REMEMBER 
QUICK ARTON JUST RUN 
RUN A BIT ARTON RUN AND THEN GO SLO O. OWLY 
AKSU RUN A BIT 
RIGHT NOW PULL AKSU 
MANY OF THE PANTHERS ISSUE INSTRUCTIONS 
PERHAPS SONRO SHOULD TAKE THE LEAD 
SLOWLY YES HALT PULL IT QUICKLY 
PULL ARTON PULL AKSU LET IT RELEASE 
PULL SLACK AKSU SLACK AKSU MORE SLACK 
AKSU LIKE THIS PULL ARTON 
GO ARTON WE DON'T HAVE TIME QUICK SLACK 
ENCHANTED DEMONS WAS REALLY HARD SONRO PANICKED 
SO YONRA TOOK CONTROL 
I DON'T THINK SONRO WAS ABLE 
TO HANDLE THAT CHALLENGE HE PANICKED 
AND LEFT IT TO ME AKSU AND ARTON TO DO THE CHALLENGE 
I THINK THE THREE OF US HOLDING THE ROPES DID WELL 
BUT I DON'T THINK THE LEADER DID VERY WELL IN DIRECTING US 
I DIDN'T DO WELL I WASN'T SHOUTING LOUD ENOUGH 
AND MY TEAM WASN'T LISTENING TO ME 
SO I WASN'T VERY GOOD BUT THEN AGAIN THE TEAM DID IT IN THE END 
YES THAT'S IT WELL DONE YOU'RE NEARLY THERE 
DESOT STILL HAS NOT COMPLETED THE OBELISK WILL LYMEL'S ENCOURAGEMENT 
SPUR HIM ON 
BRING IT UP AND TOWARDS ME WELL DONE LAST BIT 
COME ON YES 
WELL DONE YOU DID IT OH YES 
THE CHALLENGE WAS REALLY HARD 
BECAUSE WE HAD TO DRAG THE PIECES TO THE TOP OF THE SLOPE 
I GOT THERE FIRST BECAUSE I'M QUITE FAST AND STRONG 
BUT LYMEL FINISHED BEFORE ME AS SHE'S GOT GOOD BRAIN POWER 
SHE HELPED ME AND WE GOT THROUGH AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL DO THE REST 
IT WAS A HARD CHALLENGE BECAUSE I HAD TO DRAG THINGS UP A HILL 
AND I'M NOT GOOD AT THAT I'M GOOD AT THINKING SO I HAD TO HELP DESOT 
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SEE THE PATTERN 
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT WE BOTH GOT OUR JEWELS 
THE EAGLES GAINED BUT ONE JEWEL THIS DAY 
BUT THEY STILL REMAIN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TEAM WITH A TOTAL OF TWENTY THREE 
THE PANTHERS GAINED FOUR GEMS 
AND NOW HOLD TWENTY TO THEIR NAME 
BOTH TEAMS STILL MARCH WITH ALL FOUR WARRIORS THE WOLVES 
ALSO GAINED FOUR GEMS BRINGING THEIR TOTAL TO NINE 
BUT ONLY TWO WARRIORS MARCH UNDER THEIR BANNER 
THE TIGERS FAILED TO GAIN ANY JEWELS IN THE THRALL THREADS 
AND LOST LEADER MARCA BRINGING HER BACK REDUCED THEIR TOTAL 
TO JUST ONE GEM 
THE TEAM MAY BE INTACT BUT THEIR PERFORMANCE IS POOR 
MARCA A MOMENT'S CARELESSNESS IN THE THRALL THREADS TASK 
COST YOUR TEAM DEARLY DO YOU THINK YOU LET YOUR TEAM DOWN NO I DON'T 
BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE OUR UPS AND DOWNS 
AND I'VE GOT TO WORK HARDER FOR THE JEWELS NEXT TIME 
JENRO YOUR STYLE OF CROSSING WAS INTERESTING 
BUT DO YOU THINK IT WAS EFFECTIVE 
CONSIDERING YOU DIDN'T BRING ANY JEWELS IN 
IT WAS AS EFFECTIVE AS MY TEAM MATES' TECHNIQUE 
BECAUSE IT GOT ME THROUGH BUT WE WEREN'T AIMING FOR JEWELS THAT TIME 
SO I THINK IT WORKED FINE 
SOHAR I WAS RELIEVED WHEN I FINISHED 
BUT I WAS STILL CONCENTRATING ON HELPING JENRO AND HADAV 
BECAUSE THEY WERE STILL HALFWAY THROUGH THE COURSE 
HADAV CONSIDERING YOU HAD LOST YOUR LEADER 
YOU WERE KEEN TO GATHER JEWELS 
DO YOU THINK THIS WAS WISE 
I WAS KEEN TO GATHER THE GEMS BECAUSE I WAS CONFIDENT 
THAT I WOULD GET THEM BUT SOHAR AND JENRO TOLD ME IT WAS A RISK 
TRYING TO GET THEM SO I DIDN'T ATTEMPT IT 
AND BECAUSE WE'VE GOT ALL FOUR OF THE TIGERS 
WE CAN COLLECT MORE JEWELS LATER IN THE CHALLENGES 
I DON'T THINK WE'LL STRUGGLE WE'RE GOOD FRIENDS 
AND WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT QUALITIES 
THE WARRIORS ARE AT REST 
THE SHADOWS ROUND THESE CAMP FIRES 
WILL REMIND THEM OF THE SHADOWS THAT LURK IN THE DISTANT HILLS 
SHADOWS WAITING TO ATTACK TO END THIS QUEST 
NEVAR IS WATCHING AND SO MUST I 
FOR IN THE END ONLY ONE OF US CAN RETURN VICTORIOUS TO MY HOMELAND 
ONLY ONE OF US CAN PREVAIL 
NEXT TIME ON RAVEN THE SECRET TEMPLE 
ARTON MUST TAKE CARE AS THE PANTHERS TACKLE THE CHARIOTS 
RANGOLI RING IS SET TO TEST 
THE WISDOM OF THE WOLVES 
THE SPEED OF THE TIGERS IS CRUCIAL IN WATERS OF TIME 
YEADA'S LEADERSHIP IS UNDER SCRUTINY AT FIELD OF THE DEAD 
NEVAR'S DEMONS ARE CLOSE NOW AND THE WARRIORS NEED TO BE 
CONSTANTLY ON THEIR GUARD I FEEL THE TIME OF RECKONING IS AT HAND
