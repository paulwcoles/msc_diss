HELLO AGAIN FROM THE CRUCIBLE THIS 
IS THE MEDIA ROOM AND ONCE AGAIN 
THE 
PLAYER 
THE JOURNALISTS ARE 
WRITING BACK ON THE BROADCASTERS 
ARE TALKING ABOUT IS RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN WHEN FROM TWENTY BROKE OFF 
HE WAS ONE FRAME AWAY FROM A PLACE 
IN THE QUARTER FINALS IT WAS A CUE 
FOR RONNIE TO BE AT HIS SPARKLING 
BEST WHEN FRAME TWENTY AGAINST MARK 
WILLIAMS BROKE OFF 
FANTASTIC AND IF THE BLACK GOES IN 
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY HE WILL SCORE 
HERE 
I TELL YOU WHAT YOU NEVER EVER 
CALL ANY OF THESE YOU KNOW WHAT 
HE WOULD HAVE IN HIS MIND HE WILL 
BE TRYING TO STAY ON THE BLACK HERE 
I THINK IF IT WASN'T THE LAST FRAME 
OF THE MATCH I WOULD CERTAINLY 
AGREE WITH 
YOU BUT 
TO WIN THE 
MATCH AS WELL THESE BALLS ARE 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT AREN'T THEY 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
SLIGHTLY UNDERHIT IT BUT HE CAN 
PLAY THIS PLAIN BALL AND GO ROUND 
THE 
BACK OF 
THE BLACK THE RED IN IT ISN'T BAD IF HE CAN 
CURE IT EASILY CUE IT 
WE WILL 
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HIS INTENTIONS 
ARE THE WAY HE PLAYS THIS SHOT 
HE IS HITTING THE BALL SO WELL 
WHEN YOU ARE CUEING AT YOUR VERY 
BEST EVEN IN YOUR OWN MIND YOU 
SOMETIMES GENERATE MORE SPIN THAN 
YOU NEED TO BECAUSE HE IS CUEING 
SO WELL HE IS GETTING SO MUCH 
MOVEMENT OF THE CUE BALL HE 
SOMETIMES GETTING OUT OF POSITION 
BECAUSE HE IS HITTING IT TOO GOOD 
THIS WILL BE THE FOURTH BLACK COMING 
UP STEPHEN HENDRY HAS MADE A 
MAXIMUM BREAKS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
HAS MADE EIGHT MAXIMUM BREAKS IN 
COMPETITIVE PLAY AS WELL HE MIGHT 
BE AFTER ANOTHER RECORD 
HE KNOWS HE HAS GOT ONE TO THE LEFT 
AND ONE TO THE RIGHT HE MAY PLAY A 
SPLIT HERE 
THIS IS KEY IF THIS 
WORKS OUT OH HE HAS STUCK ON THEM 
BUT HE HAS STILL GOT ONE TO THE 
MIDDLE 
HAS HE GOT A BIT OF ANGLE TO TRY 
AND GET BACK TO THE BLACK OFF THIS 
ONE 
THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF ANGLE THERE 
HE MADE IT 
THERE IS A BUZZ GOING ROUND THE 
CRUCIBLE THEATRE THEY KNOW WHAT'S 
HAPPENING HERE 
JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR MAY HAVE 
TO GET THE EXTENSION OUT HERE HE 
WILL HAVE TO PLAY A DELICATE SHOT 
JUST TO DROP ON 
THE BLACK 
IT 
SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM WELL MARK 
IS JUST WONDERING HOW MANY HE'S 
GOING TO SCORE HERE 
HE HAS JUST FLICKED BACK RED YOU 
CAN SEE THE CROWD HOPING THEY ARE 
GOING TO WITNESS A BIT OF HISTORY 
HE HAS JUST FLICKED THE RED TO 
COVER BOTH OF THOSE REDS UP IN ONE 
POCKET HE NEEDS TO TRAVEL LITTLE 
BIT THIS IS JUST PHENOMENAL PLAY 
JUST ONE MORE RED THAT WILL KNOCK 
MARK WILLIAMS OUT OF THIS YEAR'S A 
TAKE IT COM CHAMPIONSHIP EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT 
COM 
MARK WILLIAMS WILL NOT HAVE 
BEGRUDGED THE WAY RONNIE HAS PLAYED 
WHEN WILL HE PLAY THE CANNON I 
DON'T KNOW IF ONE OF THE REDS NEAR 
THE PINK POTS IT DOES IT DOES 
OH HE WANTED TO GO A LITTLE BIT 
FURTHER AND HE WOULD HAVE 
TRIED TO 
FREE 
THE ONE 
NEXT TO 
THE PINK THAT 
IS THE 
KEY ONE NOW BUT HE HASN'T 
GOT THE ANGLE HERE 
I AM NOT SO 
SURE WHETHER IT POTS YOU KNOW HE 
MAY NOT HAVE TO PLAY THE CANNON NO NO IT LOOKS TIGHT FROM THAT ANGLE 
THERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PLAYING 
FOR TWO REDS AT ONCE THAT IS WHAT 
YOU HAVE GOT TO DO IN THIS 
SITUATION WHAT A SHOT 
THAT IS ONE OF THE BEST POSITIONAL 
SHOTS I HAVE EVER SEEN HE WAS 
ALMOST STRAIGHT 
TO GENERATE THE 
ANGLE HE DID TO GET THE CANNON AND 
TO CONTROL ITS WELL HE DESERVES 
ONE NOW CONTROL IT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND AVAILABLE FOR THE MAXIMUM 
THIS COULD BE THE LAST WORRYING 
SHOT HE IS PERFECT 
FOUR COLOURS TO BEAT STEPHEN 
HENDRY'S RECORD THAT HE JOINTLY 
HOLDS WITH STEPHEN AT THE MOMENT 
THIS WOULD BE HIS NINTH MAXIMUM BREAK 
TO QUOTE ONE OF THE LATE GREAT'S 
GOOD LUCK SON BECAUSE THIS HAS 
BEEN FLAWLESS THE LATE GREATS 
THIS PLACE WILL ERUPT IF THIS BLACK 
DISAPPEARS THIS HAS BEEN 
UNBELIEVABLE PLAY HAS STOPPED ON 
THE OTHER TABLE HE HAS DONE IT AN 
UNBELIEVABLE BREAK MARK WILLIAMS 
UP WITH HIS HAND WITH 
CONGRATULATIONS THAT WAS UP THERE 
WITH THE VERY BEST 
IT JUST DOESN'T 
GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT THAT IS 
THREE OF HIS MAXIMUM BREAKS OUT 
DONE THE MAN IS A TOTAL GENIUS 
THAT WAS THE BEST ONE YOU HAVE EVER 
DONE THE BEST SHOT HE PLAYED WAS 
WHEN 
YOU MOVED THE RED AWAY TO YOU ROOM TO GET INTO THE BLACK THERE WAS PYRAMID OF SIX THAT 
GAVE YOU 
ROOM TO PLAY THE NEXT ONE 
FANTASTIC A YES 
THAT WAS 
SOMETHING SOMETHING WINNING THE WORLD TITLE WAS GREAT 
BUT FOR THE PURE ADRENALIN BUZZ 
THERE IS NO DRUG LIKE IT NOTHING 
CAN COMPARE TO ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN YOUR 
ADRENALIN THE FEELING AND THE BUT 
JUST AROUND MY HEART AND MY 
BODY IT STILL IS I HAVE CALMED 
DOWN A BIT BECAUSE I HAVE HAD A FEW 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVENS WHEN YOU GET TO A CERTAIN 
STAGE YOU ARE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU 
DON'T MAKE THEM BUT TO ACTUALLY DO 
IT IT IS GREAT MY MISSUS SAYS 
I'M THE TIGHTEST MAN ON THE PLANET 
I MIGHT BUY MYSELF A BENTLEY 
CONVERTIBLE OR SOMETHING L. WAS 
THINKING ABOUT THAT BEFORE THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP HAVE JUST GOT 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND WOULD TRY AND COVER IT 
WITH THE BOOKIES SO IT IS MONEY IN 
THE BANK 
MIGHT GET A BENTLEY CONVERTIBLE TO FLOAT ABOUT IN AND 
I MYSELF A NEW PAIR OF 
RUNNING TRAINERS WRITE MY 
SHOPPING LIST LATER I'M GOING 
BUY MYSELF SOME PRESENCE THIS YEAR 
GREAT GREAT STUFF JOHN PARROTT 
HAS JOINED US L. THINK RONNIE NOW HE REALLY GETS SWITCHED ON 
BY BEING 
THE GREAT ENTERTAINER WOULD YOU 
AGREE 
VERY MUCH SAID HE NOT THE AGREE FIRST LONG RED IN WHICH WAS A 
FANTASTIC SHOT AND YOU COULD SEE 
STRAIGHT 
AWAY IN 
HIS 
FACE HE 
WAS 
GOING FOR THE MAXIMUM 
AS FAR AS 
MONEY IS CONCERNED 
WHEN HE 
UP THIS WEEK HE SEEMS TO BE QUITE 
CONSERVATIVE ABOUT HIS CHANCES IN 
HOW DO YOU RATE 
THEM 
HE LOOKS VERY FOCUSED HE THEM CERTAINLY SEEMS AT EASE WITH 
HIMSELF 
I THINK 
HE IS 
GOING 
TO BE 
A MASSIVE MASSIVE 
FAVOURITE IN 
THIS TOURNAMENT AND WILL TAKE SOME 
BEATING 
ANDY IS GOING TO GET A BEATING FLASH NEW CAR AWESOME TRAINING 
SHOES 
IF NO ONE EQUALS THIS IT IS SHOES NEARLY HALF A MILLION POUNDS FOR A 
MAXIMUM BREAK 
LET'S GRAB A FEW 
PEOPLE FROM INSIDE THE MEDIA ROOM 
PHILIP START FROM FIVE LIVE WHAT DID 
YOU MAKE OF RONNIE'S ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
IT WASN'T 
BAD WAS IT L. THINK HE HAS GOT 
POTENTIAL TO BE HONEST EVEN BY 
O'SULLIVAN'S BRILLIANT STANDARDS 
IT WAS SOMETHING TO BEHOLD THAT IS 
WHY HE'S STILL PLAYS THE GAME WE 
KNOW 
THAT SOMETIMES 
HE 
IS 
PERHAPS NOT TURNING UP WORTH 
TURNING UP BUT WHEN HE GETS THAT 
BUZZ AND 
SENSES DIDN'T 
FROM 
CROWD 
CAN HE 
FEEDS OFF IT HE WAS 
ON ANOTHER PLANE THIS AFTERNOON L. L. 
THINK HE KNEW MARK WILLIAMS HAD GAME TO 
COME BACK 
AT 
HIM AND 
INSPIRED HIM 
TO PRODUCE 
HIS 
IF HE CAN MAINTAIN THAT STANDARD 
WHICH WILL BE DIFFICULT AND 
O'SULLIVAN GETS FRUSTRATED IT 
DOESN'T IT IS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF 
WHO WILL BE PICKING 
UP THE 
UP CHECK WHEN HE LIFTS THE TROPHY 
PHIL YATES WE 
HAVE JUST 
BEEN 
DISCUSSING THAT RONNIE IS TAKING 
OVER THIS 
MANTLE OF 
DEMANDING 
TO BE 
THAT IS WHAT 
HE ENJOYS HE ALWAYS SEEM TO 
PRODUCE HIS BEST 
PERFORMANCES 
AGAINST PLAYERS HE RESPECTS THE 
LIKES OF WILLIAMS HENDRY THERE IS 
A LENGTHY LIST WHEN HE STRUGGLES 
IS WHEN HE COMES UP AGAINST PLAYERS 
HE PERCEIVES TO BEAT BORDER'S MARK 
WILLIAMS A VERY ATTACKING PLAYER 
AND I THINK IT REALLY SEEDED 
O'SULLIVAN THIS AFTERNOON FOUR 
FRAMES IN TOTAL OF THE HIGHEST 
QUALITY THEIR OWN THEY TOOK ONLY 
FORTY FOUR MINUTES AND TOMORROW LET'S 
JUST TALK FISCALLY THE THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVENS 
BREAKS HE HAS MADE HAVE BEEN WORTH 
TO HIM FOR WONDER NINETY ONE THOUSAND THE 
THREE SPACE 
JOE SWAIL FROM NORTHERN IRELAND 
PLAYER WITH VAST EXPERIENCE ON THE 
SNOOKER CIRCUIT OR CHINA'S LIANG 
WENBO ON THE TABLE AND OFF THE 
TABLE FOR VARIETY OF REASONS HE HAS 
BEEN MAKING QUITE NAME FOR HIMSELF HIMSELF PLEASE WELCOME YOUR REFEREES FOR 
TONIGHT'S MATCHES THIS IS A CHARACTER THIS YOUNG MAN 
A PLAYER THAT GOES FOR ABSOLUTELY 
EVERYTHING 
WHAT ABOUT THAT FOR A EVERYTHING SHOT 
ATTACKING EXCITING FOR SOME SHOT BRILLIANT PLAYER EXCELLENT SMILE 
ON HIS FACE HIS EYES ARE VERY BIG AND HE IS VERY YOUNG VERY HANDSOME 
I LIKE THE PLAYER WITH A BIG SMILE 
ON HIS FACE 
AND LIANG SET OUT THIS MORNING 
HOPING TO BUILD ON HANDSOME SIX HUNDRED TWENTY TWO 
LEAD FROM THE FIRST SESSION SIX TO TWO 
LEAD BUT IT WAS JOE STRUCK FIRST 
A BREAK OF SEVENTY ONE WIPING THE SMILE FROM 
ONE BODE'S FACE AS HIS LEAD WAS CUT 
TO THREE LIANG STILL HAD LADY LUCK 
IN HIS CORNER THOUGH AS EVIDENCED 
BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS FLUKE 
THE RED'S CLOSE HE HAS FLUKED IT 
MIND YOU WAS A CASE OF TWO FOR THE 
PRICE OF ONE PER JOE IN THE NEXT 
IT WAS A CASE SEVEN TO FOUR THE SCORE 
FRAME TWELVE ALSO WENT THE WAY OF THE 
MAN FROM ULSTER HELPED BY A BREAK 
OF SIXTY SIX 
FRAME THIRTEEN PROVE TO BE EXTREMELY 
UNLUCKY FOR JOE HAVING GOT HIMSELF 
TO WITHIN TOUCHING DISTANCE OF 
PINCHING IT THIS HAPPENED 
OH UNBELIEVABLE 
LESSER MEN WOULD HAVE CRUMBLED BUT 
THE AT LAW IS MADE OF STERN STUFF 
AND BECAME RIGHT BACK WITH BREAK 
OF SEVENTY ONE THE OUTLAW THE NEXT 
CONTAINED SOME GOOD BUT ALSO SOME 
BAD FROM JOE LIANG WAS ABLE TO 
REST THAT LITTLE BIT EASIER AFTER 
BREAK OF FIFTY EIGHT BUT THE FINAL FRAME OF 
THE SESSION WAS ALL ABOUT JOE A 
BREAK OF NINETY TWO AND NOW THE IRISH ARE 
SMILING SWAIL PUMPED UP JUST NINE 
SEVEN DOWN 
ON TABLE NUMBER ONE A MAN 
SEVEN DOWN WHOSE FIRST ROUND ENTRANCE IS 
ALREADY THE STUFF OF LEGEND HIM AT 
THE CRUCIBLE OVERCOMING FORMER 
CHAMPION KEN DOHERTY TO BE A DOES 
HE STAY OR DOES HE GO LIANG WENBO 
AND FINALLY THE FORMER IRISH 
PROFESSIONAL CHAMPION TWICE A 
SEMI FINALIST HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE 
THEY CALL HIM THE OUTDOOR JOE 
SWAIL THEY CALL HIM THE HOUR 
ALL FIRST THIRTEEN WILL PLAY RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN IN THE LAST EIGHT OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
FRAME SEVENTEEN IS UNDER WAY CHAMPIONSHIP LET'S SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING AS WE 
CATCH UP WITH DENNIS TAYLOR AND 
WILLIE THORNE IN THE COMMENTARY BOX 
IT HAS BEEN A VERY EDGY OPENING 
BOTH PLAYERS HAVE HAD MANY CHANCES 
THE YOUNG CHINESE PLAYER SEEMS TO 
BE SUFFERING WITH THE CRUCIBLE 
NERVES HE HASN'T UP UNTIL NOW 
THIS WAS A STRAIGHT FORWARD PINK HE 
MISSED AND HE WAS IN WITH A GREAT 
CHANCE THERE AND THIS WAS A LITTLE 
BIT TOUGH FOR A LONGISH RED AS I 
SAY BOTH PLAYERS HAVE HAD CHANCES 
IS THIS A PLANT WILL IT GO PAST 
THE PINK 
I THINK IT IS JUST THE OPENING 
FRAME AND THE IMPORTANCE TO BOTH 
PLAYERS WILLIE IS WHY THEY HAVE 
MISSED SO MANY CHANCES 
YES WENBO 
HAS NEVER PLAYED UNDER THIS 
PRESSURE BEFORE IN HIS CAREER AND 
TO THINK OF HAVING SO MANY CHANCES 
IN THIS FRAME HE HAS HAD A COUPLE 
OF CASES OF GOOD FORTUNE AT TIMES 
NOTHING HAS GONE RIGHT FOR JOE IN 
THIS OPENING FRAME THE LEAD TWENTY THREE 
POINTS CHANCE TO WIN THE FRAME AT 
THIS VISIT THE BALLS ARE NICE 
YOU WOULD NORMALLY SAY THAT THIS IS 
A CHANCE TO TAKE THE FRAME BUT 
AFTER WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR IT 
IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE 
I WAS TALKING TO LIANG'S MANAGER UP 
IN THE CHAMPIONS LOUNGE AND HE 
SAID THAT HE DEFINITELY FEELS A 
LITTLE BIT NERVOUS NOW THAT HE IS 
IN TO THE FINAL SESSION HERE BUT 
HE CERTAINLY HOLDING HIMSELF 
TOGETHER HERE HE IS CERTAINLY 
HOLDING HIMSELF TOGETHER HERE 
YES HE DIDN'T SHOW ANY NERVES AT 
ALL WITH KEN DOHERTY IN THE OPENING 
ROUND WE USUALLY SAY ABOUT ROOKIES 
COMING TO THE CRUCIBLE BUT THEY 
SOMETIMES TAKE A FULL TIME TO 
SETTLE AGAINST DOHERTY LOOKS HE 
LOOKED AS IF HE HAD BEEN HERE FOR 
THE LAST TEN YEARS THIS IS THE 
FIRST TIME 
IN 
THE MATCH 
THAT 
HE HAS 
LOOKED A BIT SHAKY TONIGHT BUT IT 
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE MADE ANY 
DIFFERENCE HE 
IS ALMOST 
CERTAIN 
NOW TO WIN THIS FRAME 
THIS WILL HOPE TO SETTLE THIS YOUNG 
TALENTED PLAYER DOWN HERE WALKS 
HE HAS KNOCKED TWO BALLS ON TO THE 
FLOOR THERE 
HE ACTUALLY FOULED THE WHITE IT 
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER THAT WAS 
BIT OF A SCRAPPY OPENING FRAME BUT 
THAT FIFTY ONE BREAK GIVES IT TO BE AN 
CHINESE PLAYER AND HE NOW LEADS TEN 
SEVEN SEVEN JOHN PARROTT I WAS GOING TO ASK 
YOU HOW YOU THOUGHT LIANG'S TEMPLE 
IT WOULD BE IN THIS SITUATION 
BECAUSE GREAT PLAYER THAT HE IS 
GREAT POTENTIAL THAT HE HAS SHOWN 
THIS IS DIFFERENT SITUATION FOR HIM 
IT IS VERY MUCH UNKNOWN HIM TERRITORY THE BOYS IN COMMENTARY 
WERE SAYING 
HE MIGHT BE NERVOUS IF NERVOUS 
IN THE 
LAST SIXTEEN OF 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP HE ISN'T DOING 
WELL YOU HAVE TO FEEL NERVOUS YOU 
HAVE TO FEEL AS IF IT MEANS 
SOMETHING HE HAS HELD HIMSELF 
TOGETHER VERY WELL 
THERE HAS BEEN 
NO EVIDENCE OF HIM BEING RATTLED 
YET 
NO HE HAS NOT GOT TOTALLY YET NEAR THE WINNING LINE YET AND HE IS 
ALSO TEN PLAYING IN 
SOMEBODY WHO 
IS VERY VERY 
GOOD AT 
COMING FROM 
BEHIND IN SNOOKER MATCHES AT THE 
CRUCIBLE HE HAS GOT TO THE SEMI 
FINALS IN THE PAST HE CERTAINLY 
DID IT AGAINST ME A FEW YEARS AGO 
YOU CAN SEE IT IN JOE'S FACE 
SOMETIMES THE NEAR IT GETS TO THE 
WINNING LINE ONE WAY 
OR ANOTHER 
HE 
GETS EVEN MORE DETERMINED 
HE IS 
VERY VERY DETERMINED HE HAS AN 
UNUSUAL CUE ACTION HE HITS THE 
BALL BEAUTIFULLY BUT HE IS A VERY 
VERY GOOD COMPETITOR AND BLESSED 
WITH AN EXCELLENT TEMPERAMENT 
JOE SWAIL WILL NEED ALL HIS 
BATTLING QUALITIES HE HAS DONE IT 
MANY TIMES COMING FROM BEHIND 
AGAINST HIGHER SEEDED PLAYERS THIS 
TIME HE IS AGAINST A LAW BACK A 
LOWER RANKED PLAYER THAT SOMETIMES 
MAKES A DIFFERENCE 
LIANG DID VERY 
WELL HE DID MISS FOR FIVE EASY 
ONES FORTY FIVE LIANG STEPPED AWAY FROM 
THE TABLE THERE THERE YOU CAN SEE 
THAT HE JUST TOUCHED THE WHITE 
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T 
HAPPEN VERY OFTEN JIMMY WHITE USED 
TO DO IT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE HE 
USED TO CUE UP SO CLOSE TO THE CUE 
BALL 
NOW LOOK AT THAT HOW DID THOSE 
BOYS KNOW THAT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
WAS GOING TO MAKE A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
NOW THIS IS A KEY SHOT FOR JOE 
SWAIL HE LOOKS TO BE STRAIGHT ON 
THE RED YOU WILL FINISH ON THE 
BLACK THIS WILL BE A TEST OF 
CUEING YOU HAVE GOT TO PUSH THE 
CUE THROUGH IN A PERFECT STRAIGHT 
LINE ONE OF THE TOUGHEST SHOTGUN 
WILLIE TO PLAY THE STUN RUN 
THROUGH FOR STOCK 
YES IT 
IS A 
THROUGH FOR STOCK YES IT IS A PLAYERS 
THAT IT 
IS A SHOT THAT 
PLAYERS PRACTICE THOUGH 
A BOUNCE OF THE CUE BALL WHICH 
MEANT IT TOOK BIT OF PACE OUT OF IT PROBABLY A 
PRETTY GOOD 
CHOICE IT PROBABLY A PRETTY GOOD CHOICE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT QUITE AS 
DIFFICULT IT LOOKED A DIFFICULT 
POT BUT A STRAIGHT ONE 
IS THE 
ONE 
THAT 
IF YOU 
DON'T 
PUSH THE 
THROUGH IN A STRAIGHT LINE YOU MISS 
ABSOLUTELY COMEDY PLAYED IT 
PERFECTLY HE NEEDED TO MISS THE 
ONE THAT WAS LOOSE 
THIS IS GOOD FROM JOE SWAIL BECAUSE 
HE DID HAVE A FEW CHANCES IN THE 
OPENING FRAME OPENING FRAME A 
BAD CONTACT THERE BUT HE IS O. K. HE 
COULD DO WITH KNOCKING IN A 
SIZEABLE CONTRIBUTION HERE 
THE SCORELINE DOES NOT ALWAYS TELL 
THE CORRECT STORY JOE SWAIL IF HE 
POTS THIS RED WILL GO AHEAD ON 
POINTS IT IS A STRANGE ONE IF 
SOMEONE HAS A HIGHER POT SUCCESS 
RATE TO EXPECT THEM TO BE IN FRONT 
YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO BE IN 
FRONT FRONT THEY ONCE DID AT TOURNAMENT OVER 
SIX FRAMES ON AGGREGATE SCORES 
SOME PLAYERS WON THE MATCH FOUR TO TWO BUT 
LOST BECAUSE IT WAS ON AGGREGATE 
POINTS GETTING TIGHTER NOW JUST A 
COUPLE OF REDS AVAILABLE HE WAS 
GETTING DOWN TO PLAY THE PINK 
WHICH IS AN EASIER SHOT TO GET IN 
POSITION 
OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN IT FROM 
A JOE SWAIL WHEN HE IS UNDER THE 
COSH HE TENDS TO PLAY MUCH BETTER 
JOHN PARROTT THAT TIME HE CAME 
BACK FROM TWELVE TO WAY DOWN TO BEAT 
JOHN WAS A STUNNING PERFORMANCE 
TWELVE TO EIGHT 
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE CUE POWER HE 
GETS 
A GOOD PERFORMANCE FROM JOE 
SHOWING HIS BATTLING QUALITIES ONCE 
AGAIN AGAIN I'M NOT SURE WHAT HE SAID TO ALAN 
CHAMBERLAIN WE WILL FIND OUT 
SHORTLY SOMETHING DISTRACTING JOE 
IT IS ONE OF THE CAMERAMAN 
CAMERA MEN THERE SEEMS TO BE A 
WHITE LIGHT COMING OUT OF ONE OF 
THE STILLS PHOTOGRAPHERS CAMERAS 
PHOTOGRAPHER'S CAMERAS WELL PLAYED 
JOE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DECENT BREAK 
BUILDER WHAT HE HAS GOT THAT BIT 
BETTER THAN MOST IS HE AS GOT A 
MAGNIFICENT TEMPERAMENT HE HAS 
GOT A MAGNIFICENT TEMPERAMENT YOU 
HAVE A BETTER CHANCE TO BEAT JOE 
SWAIL IF HE BEAT IN EASY IF HE 
GETS CLOSE A LOT OF THE TIME HE 
WILL BE SECOND FAVOURITE 
YOU WILL BE SECOND FAVOURITE 
I REMEMBER HIM IN THE NATIONS CUP 
AND WE PLAYED ENGLAND JOE PLAYED 
SOME FANTASTIC FRAMES WE KNOCKED 
ENGLAND OUT THAT YEAR JOE WAS THE 
STAR HE IS NOT QUITE SAFE YET AND 
HE MAY NOT BE ON A POT HERE ALL 
COVERING EACH OTHER HE COULD DO 
WITH GETTING A GOOD WHITE HERE HE 
COULD DO WITH KNOCKING SOMETHING 
NEAR A CUSHION 
THERE IS A VERY GOOD EFFORT FROM 
JOE SWAIL THAT IS A VERY GOOD 
EFFORT EFFORT JOE AS SEXUALLY NOT MADE A CENTURY 
BREAK THIS SEASON IN SNOOKER THAT 
IS AMAZING GILL HAS NOT MADE A 
CENTURY BREAK GEL JOE SWAIL 
HE HAS MADE THE HIGHEST BREAK IN 
THIS MATCH 
THAT IS ALMOST FRAME BALL IT PUTS 
AND SIXTY SIX IN FRONT ANY COLOUR 
THERE IS STILL SOMETHING PUTTING 
JOE OFF HE HAS LEFT THE EXTENSION 
BYE BYE EVERYBODY IT IS UNUSUAL TO 
LEAVE THE EXTENSION IN THE DRESSING 
ROOM HE WILL ONLY BE A COUPLE OF 
MINUTES MINUTES OBVIOUSLY HE'S PLAYER HAS 
DIFFERENT EXTENSION EACH PLAYER 
THERE IS LIANG WENBO ALL HAVING A 
SMILE OF THE CROWD HE HAS TURNED 
OUT TO BE A FANTASTIC CHARACTER 
THIS CROWD HAVE REALLY TAKEN TO THE 
YOUNG CHINESE PLAYER THEY DO LOVE 
HIM AS THEY DID WITH JOE SWAIL 
WHEN HE GOT TO THE SEMI FINAL HERE 
ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS 
IT IS UNUSUAL FOR A ROOKIE TO COME 
HERE AND ENJOY HIMSELF USUALLY 
PEOPLE ARE SO FRIGHTENED WHEN THEY 
FIRST COME HERE OBVIOUSLY HIS 
ENGLISH IS NOT VERY GOOD BUT HE 
ENJOYS SMILING AT EVERYBODY GILL 
RETURNS WITH ITS EXTENSIVE JOE 
SWAIL 
JO USES A SCHOOL IN EXTENSION 
JOE SWAIL USES A SCHOOL IN 
EXTENSION SCHOOL IN 
THAT BREAK OF SIXTY NINE SHOULD BE ENOUGH 
TO CLOSE THE GAP TO TWO 
HE REALLY COULD DO WITH TRYING TO 
STOP ON THE BLACK HERE IT IS VERY 
DIFFICULT WITH THE BALL IS SITUATED 
WHERE THE BALL IS SITUATED 
HE COULD AFFORD TO TAKE THE BLUE IF 
HE POTTED THIS RED BUT THEN HE 
WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO TIE 
THAT IS A BIT UNLUCKY HE MAY STILL BE ON IT 
IT WAS CLOSE BUT NOT CLOSE ENOUGH 
LIANG WENBO NEEDED THREE SNOOKERS 
HE CONCEDES 
LET US JUST TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING ACROSS ON THE OTHER TABLE 
ALSO PLAYING FOR A PLACE IN THE 
QUARTER FINALS JOE PERRY AGAINST 
STUART BINGHAM 
JOE PERRY'S GAME SEEMS TO HAVE 
IMPROVED JOHN 
YES HE HAS A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN 
HIMSELF AT THE MOMENT IT WAS A 
DIFFICULT MATCH TO CALL HE HAS 
DONE VERY WELL TO GET HIMSELF IN 
THIS POSITION JOE PERRY 
BOTH PLAYERS HAVE GOT A CHANCE IT 
IS NOW ADVANTAGE TO JOE PERRY 
A LOT OF PRESSURE FOR STUART 
BINGHAM 
BACK TO THE OTHER TABLE JOE SWAIL 
AGAINST LIANG WENBO 
LEGACY OF JOE CAN BREAK OFF BETTER 
THAN HE DID AT THE START OF THE 
EVENING LET US SEE THAT IS MUCH 
BETTER 
FOUR FRAMES AS NORMAL IN THIS FIRST 
MINI SESSION 
IT IS ONE TO ONE AT THE MINUTE HE WOULD 
BE HAPPY TO GO TWO TO ONE UP IT WOULD 
MAKE IT ELEVEN ELEVEN TO NINE 
ABSOLUTE PERFECTION TO POT A BALL 
LIKE THAT AND IT WAS A FREE SHOT 
HE IS ON THE BLACK HE WILL NOT 
THIS OUT OF THE WAY HAS HE GONE 
TOO FAR HE MAY HAVE AFTER THAT 
FANTASTIC POT A LITTLE RAP OF 
THE TABLE IT SHOWS YOU WHAT IT 
MEANS TO THIS YOUNG PLAYER WHO 
STARTED THIS WRAPPING ON THE TABLE 
PROBABLY JOHN VIRGO IT IS UNUSUAL 
THAT IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE SEEN 
A LITTLE BIT OF PETULANCE FROM THIS 
YOUNG MAN BUT HE KNEW THIS WAS 
GREAT CHANCE HE DOES LIKE TO LOOK 
AT PLANTS PERCY THROWER WOULD BE 
PROUD PROUD GOD REST HIS SOUL HE HAS A 
BEAUTIFUL GARDEN CENTRE AROUND THE 
TELFORD SHREWS BRIE AREA 
SHREWSBURY 
THAT IS A GOOD SAFETY SHOT HE HAS 
PLAYED THERE THIS IS NOT AN EASY 
SAFETY SHOT HE MAY BE FORCED TO 
PLAY A POT DOWN THE CUSHION IT IS 
ALL ABOUT WHETHER RED GROWS 
WHERE THE RED GOES 
I INTRODUCED ALAN TO THE REFEREEING 
HE IS A LEICESTER LAD HE IS A GOOD PLAYER ALAN 
CHAMBERLAIN NOT ALL REFEREES ARE 
GOOD PLAYERS BUT HE COULD MAKE SEVENTY 
AND EIGHTY BREAKS 
JOE SWAIL IS GOING TO NEED A CANNON 
HERE IT IS A TOP BLACK TO TAKE ON 
A DIFFICULT BLACK TO TAKE ON 
THE REASON IT SLIPPED PAST THE RED 
WAS BECAUSE HE DID NOT POT THE 
BLACK 
BECAUSE HE HIT IT THINNER IT MET 
THE WHITE DID NOT READ QUITE AS 
WIDE THIN DID NOT FRED QUITE 
AS WIDE HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SNEAK ONE IN 
YOURS NOT FAR AWAY HE WAS NOT 
FAR AWAY GILL IS IN ALL SORTS OF 
TROUBLE HERE HE MAY HAVE BE COME 
OFF THE SIDE CUSHION AND PLAY THIS 
RED INTO THE POCKET BUT BLACK IS 
BLOCKING THE RIGHT CORNER THE 
BLACK IS BLOCKING THE RIGHT CORNER 
IF HE WAS TO COME OFF THE SIDE 
CUSHION AND HIT THAT FULL BALL HE 
COULD ESCAPE HERE WITHOUT LEAVING A 
POT ON 
HE IS GOING TO TRY A VERY IN SHOT 
THEN HE PLAYED IT WELL 
I SAID HE PLAYED IT WELL BUT AS 
SOON AS IT MAKE CONTACT WITH THE 
OTHER HE HAS LEFT THE RED ON 
IT WAS NEARLY AN EXCELLENT SAFETY 
SHOT THOSE BAULK COLOURS ARE SO 
DIFFICULT TO GET BY 
THAT IS WHY I THOUGHT THE RED WOULD 
GOAL HAVE A LOOK AT HIS FACE 
COLE MACK GO WHAT A CHANCE NOW 
THIS IS THE WAY YOU WOULD SET THEM 
UP FOR A LITTLE PRACTICE SESSION 
SOMETHING HE HAS DONE AT THE 
ACADEMY IN SHEFFIELD TIME AND TIME 
AGAIN AGAIN HE PRACTISED WITH JOHN HIGGINS 
BEFORE THIS CHAMPIONSHIP WHICH 
MUST HAVE BEEN THRILL IN ITSELF 
HE ACTUALLY BEAT THE WORLD CHAMPION 
THEY PLAYED FOR FIVER THIS BOY CAN PLAY 
TO BE FAIR TO JOHN HE BEAT HIM 
AFTER THAT HE HAS ALSO PLAYED WITH 
RONNIE UP AT THE ACADEMY YOU 
CANNOT BEAT EXPERIENCE LIKE THAT 
THE WHAT CAN HE HOLD HIMSELF 
TOGETHER HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE 
BUT CAN HE HOLD HIMSELF TOGETHER 
HE IS DOING VERY WELL 
I JUST MENTIONED HE HAD BEEN 
PRACTISING RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IF HE 
WINS THIS MATCH WOULD IS THE PLAY 
IN THE QUARTER FINAL RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN WHO 
HE PLAY HIM 
JOE SWAIL AS MARTIN IN EVERY 
DEPARTMENT APART FROM WINNING THE 
FRAMES HAS MATCHED HIM THEY COULD NOT BE CLOSER UNBELIEVABLE 
HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL UNBELIEVABLE THESE THINGS 
I HAVE GOT MY ABACUS IN HERE THING 
IS IT HAS ONLY GOT TEN BUTTONS ON 
EXMOOR 
I THINK THERE IS SOMEBODY IN EUROPE 
YEAR TELLING YOU ALL OF THESE 
STATISTICS IN YOUR YEAR NO PROBLEM 
HE LOOKS SO MUCH MORE RELAXED AND 
HE DID IN THE OPENING FRAME THIS 
EVENING THOUGHT THE PRESSURE WAS 
GOING TO GET TO HIM HE HAS THE 
SAME DETERMINATION HE HAD AGAINST 
KEN DOHERTY 
JUST WIPING THE BAULK WHITE IN 
THE CUE WHITE PINK 
ALL YOU NEED IS A DAMP CLOTH TO 
FREE THE CUE HALL OR PUB 
HE WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS RED IN CUSHION 
THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING IF HE COULD 
MAKE A CENTURY BREAK 
YES I THINK IT WOULD BE HIS MAIDEN 
CENTURY AT THE CRUCIBLE IN HIS 
SHORT CAREER HE HAS ALREADY MADE TWENTY FOUR 
CENTURIES BREAK BUILDING IS 
DEFINITELY HIS STRONGEST POINT IF 
HE COULD DO THIS IT WOULD BE HIS 
FIRST CENTURY AT THE CRUCIBLE 
IF HE DOES COMPLETE A CENTURY IT 
WOULD BE THE FORTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR'S 
CHAMPIONSHIP L. THINK THE STANDARD 
HAS IMPROVED SINCE THEY RECOVERED 
THE TABLES 
YES IT HELPS YOU'RE NOT GETTING 
THAT OCCASIONAL BOUNCE JUST AS I 
HAVE SAID THAT THAT CUE BALL HAS 
COMPLETELY TAKEN UP TAKEN OFF 
HIS HIGHEST BREAK BEFORE THIS WAS A 
BREAK OF NINETY ONE WHICH SHE MADE EARLIER 
ON GREAT RECOVERY THERE 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC ANOTHER 
MILESTONE IN THESE YOUNG MAN'S 
CAREER A CENTURY BREAK AT THE 
CRUCIBLE 
IT IS HIS TENTH OF THE SEASON THERE 
MAY BE MORE TO COME 
JOE SWAIL HAD A BREAK OF SIXTY FIVE TO TAKE 
THE PREVIOUS FRAME WHAT A RESPONSE 
FROM LIANG WENBO IT TAKES HIM INTO 
AN ELEVEN TO EIGHT LEAD 
TWO FRAMES FROM A QUARTER FINAL 
JOHN HAS THE CUE IN HIS HAND CUE 
ACTION IS ONE THING BUT FIRST OF 
ALL HE IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS 
THE LAST DATE WHAT A PLAYER 
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS 
BE LIKE WHEN HE GETS NEAR THE 
WINNING LINE SO FAR SO GOOD HE 
KNOCKED THOSE BALLS IN BEAUTIFULLY 
THERE THERE THERE IS A COMPARISON IN THE CUE 
OTHER TWO PLAYERS 
HE IS MORE ORTHODOX IF YOU GET 
HOLD OF THE CUE AND HOLD IT DOWN 
MOST OF THE PLAYERS WILL BE 
STRAIGHT DOWN IN THAT POSITION JOE 
SWAIL IS ACTUALLY THE COMPLETE 
OPPOSITE HE IS WAY OUT THERE HE 
MUST HAVE GOT HIS CUE WHEN HE WAS 
YOUNG LAD HE IS RISKY OUTSIDE IT 
MAKES IT LITTLE CHICKEN WING DISH 
IT IS SO DIFFERENT 
A VERY WIDE STANCE HE FLICKS IT 
IT HAS GOT A LOVELY 
ALSO WHERE HIS POWER COMES 
WOULD THE PUREST SAID THAT IS THE 
WRONG WAY TO GO WITH THE CUE 
IT IS JUST LIKE GOLF EVERYBODY 
WILL HAVE DIFFERENT SWING IN THE 
OPEN IT WORKS FOR JOE SWAIL HE 
HAS GONE UP PLAYING THAT WAY AND HE 
HAS GOT HIMSELF IN THE LAST SIXTEEN OF 
THE WORK HE KNOWS HIS METHOD AND 
HE IS VERY GOOD AT IT 
LIANG WENBO HAS BEEN BASING HIMSELF 
IN SHEFFIELD SO HE GETS GOOD 
PRACTICE FACILITIES 
THE FIRST YEAR PURCELL WOULD BE 
VERY DIFFICULT BEING AWAY FROM HOME 
YEAR HERSELF HE HAS NOW SETTLED 
IN HE IS THERE EVERY DAY 
FANTASTIC COMPETITION 
THERE IS NO BETTER PRACTICE THAN 
PLAYING WITH PLAYERS TO OUR BETTER 
THEN YOU YOU LEARNT MORE FROM 
PLAYING GREAT PLAYER THAN 
WATCHING IT ON THE TELEVISION WHEN 
YOU'RE UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL THAT 
IS WHAT YOU SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO 
WITH ONE WITH THE CUE BALL 
THIS IS THE MOST FRAME FOR JOE 
SWAIL HE WOULD BE TWELVE TO EIGHT 
BEHIND 
IT WOULD BE A MONUMENTAL TASK TO 
WIN HERE FROM THAT SCORE 
HE DID FIND THE PATH BACK AROUND 
THE BACK OF THE BLACK AND REDS JOE 
A SHAKING HIS 
HEAD BECAUSE 
HE COULD 
QUITE EASILY HAVE LEFT 
THIS RED 
JOE BUT IT HAS FINISHED SAY 
SAFE 
IF JOE CAN JUST STUNNED OVER A 
LITTLE BIT AND BLOCKED THE PATH TO 
THE REDS USING THE GREEN THAT 
COULD PUT LIANG IN A BIT OF TROUBLE 
HERE HE HASN'T BLOCKED THE PATH 
HE HAS LEFT HIM A STRAIGHT FORWARD 
SAFETY SHOT L. THOUGHT HE JUST 
STUNT THE WHITE 
A 
AND HE COULD 
HAVE HAD LIANG 
IN ALL 
SORTS OF TROUBLE IF HE HAD PUT IT 
THERE THIS ESCAPE WOULD NOT HAVE 
BEEN AVAILABLE FOR LIANG WE SAW THE 
SHAKE OF 
THE HEAD FROM 
JOE TO BE HONEST I HAVE LOST 
WATCHED A LOT OF THIS MATCH AND I 
THINK LIANG WENBO HAS GOT AWAY WITH 
QUITE A FEW OF HIS LONG POTS BUT 
WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING WELL YOU GET 
THAT BIT OF A RUN IN THE VERY 
FIRST FRAME OF THIS EVENING LIANG 
WENBO MISSED A COUPLE OF SHOTS AND 
BOTH TIMES COVERED UP REDS FOR JOE 
BUT YOU CAN'T WIN MATCHES PLAYING 
POOR SAFETY AND 
THAT WAS 
A 
POOR 
SAFETY SHOT FROM JOE THIS IS JOE 
SHAKING HIS HEAD WHEN HE WAS COMING 
TO THE TABLE AFTER LIANG WENBO 
MISSED THAT LONG POT IT GETS YOU 
DOWN IF THE OPPONENT KEEPS MISSING 
THEM AND GETTING THEM SAFE IT 
MIGHT SEEM AS IF IT IS NOT YOUR DAY 
THE GAP WASN'T QUITE THERE 
I THINK 
THE GAP WAS THERE IF HE HAD ROLLED 
IT BUT AS SOON AS HE FORCED IT 
LOOK WHERE THE BALLS HAVE GONE HE 
COULD HAVE LEFT AN EASIER STARTER 
HE DIDN'T TAKE YOUR ADVICE WILLIE 
MINE AND JOHN PARROTT'S HEAD WOULD 
HAVE DROPPED OFF HERE JOE HAS NOT 
REALLY SHAKEN HIS HEAD YES THERE 
IS AN EASY EASY OPENING RED IF 
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ON THE RED 
BUT THEY ARE BOTH DIFFICULT AT PACE 
IT IS A BIG FISH POCKET BIG ISH 
POCKET THOUGH 
THIS IS JUST A CHANCE JOAN NEEDED 
TO CALM THE NERVES IF HE CAN PINCH 
THIS FRAME HE KNOWS THAT WENBO IS 
GOING TO COME UNDER PRESSURE AT 
SOME STAGE AT TWELVE EIGHT YOU KNOW 
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE FEW CHANCES 
DID YOU EVER SAY TO YOURSELF 
DENNIS I AM NOT REALLY GOING TO BE 
ULTRA CONCERNED UNTIL MY OPPONENT 
GET TO TWELVE 
NO I JUST WANTED TO GET 
OVER THE LINE AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE WILLIE 
THERE IS THE FLICK THAT JOHN 
PARROTT WAS TALKING ABOUT IN THE 
STUDIO A LITTLE BIT OF NOISE FROM 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARENA AND 
JOHN WAS ALSO TALKING ABOUT GOLFERS 
AND ANOTHER GREAT IRISH GOLFER 
EAMONN DARCY HE HAD AN UNUSUAL 
BACKSWING TO STOP IT WAS ONE OF THE 
BEST BALL STRIKERS YOU COULD EVER 
WISH TO SEE HE HAD AN UNUSUAL 
BACKSWING HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST 
BALL STRIKERS YOU WOULD EVER 
COULD EVER WISH TO SEE 
HE CAN WIN THE FRAME WITHOUT 
WORRYING ABOUT THE REDS THE THREE 
REDS ON THE CUSHION ANYTHING ABOVE 
SIXTY FIVE SEVENTY WOULD BE PERFECT HERE HOW 
QUICK DID HE PLAY THAT HE GOT DOWN 
AFTER HARDLY ANY BACKSWING AT ALL 
AND HIT IT 
THAT HAS GOT TO BE A 
MIXTURE OF PRESSURE BUT A LAPSE IN 
CONCENTRATION WITH ONE THAT EASY 
IT SHOWS YOU IF YOU DON'T 
CONCENTRATE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT YOU CAN MISS 
SITTERS 
THERE WAS HARDLY ANY TIME SITTERS ON THE SHOT DENNIS HE JUST HAD 
ONE SWING BACK AND HIT 
I THINK 
THAT'S ONE OF THE EASIEST BALLS YOU 
WILL EVER SEE MISSED HOW COSTLY IS 
THAT GOING TO BE 
THE FACT THAT I NOTE JOE HAS ANY FIFTEEN 
POINT LEAD HE MAY NOW STILL NEED 
ONE OF THOSE DIFFICULT REDS ON THE 
SIGN SIDE CUSHION WENBO IF HE 
IS GOING TIP WIN AT THIS VISIT 
TELL ME IF YOU THINK HE PLAYED THIS 
QUICK 
HE HAD THREE OR FOUR FEATHERS AT 
THE BALL SO 
I MUST BE HONEST 
AT FIRST GLANCE I THOUGHT HE 
PLAYED IT QUICKER THAN HE DID BUT 
IT HAS GONE NOW AND THERE IS A BIT 
OF MOVEMENT IN THE CROWD AS DENNIS 
JUST SAID THE OTHER SESSION HAS 
FINISHED EARLY 
I THINK THAT COULD BE A BIG BIG 
TURNING POINTS IN THIS MATCH AS WE 
SAID THERE ARE THREE SAFE REDS ON 
THE SIDE CUSHION AS WE SAID BUT 
THE SCORES ARE ALL SQUARE IT IS 
NAIL BITING TIME FOR JOE SWAIL 
AS WILLIE SAID 
THE BEST HE CAN BE 
IS ABOUT FIFTY ODD POINTS IN FRONT 
THAT LITTLE FIFTEEN POINT LEAD MEANT HE 
WILL HAVE TO MOVE ONE OF THOSE 
THREE REDS INTO PLAY 
THERE ARE THREE REDS SAFE THE LEFT 
SIDE OF THE TABLE JOE WILL ALSO 
KNOW THERE IS ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE 
AS WE LOOK AT IT THE REDS ON THE 
LEFT SIDE 
YES THE WORK STARTS NOW DOESN'T 
IT THE NEXT TWO REDS ARE O. K. BUT 
THEN IT IS TIME TO START THINKING 
ABOUT MOVING BALLS IDEALLY I 
WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO LEAVE THIS 
RED HE'S PLAYING THERE AND TRY AND 
GET ONE OF THE OTHER ONES 
AND THEN 
PLAY A 
CANNON 
INTO THOSE 
TWO REDS 
ON THE CUSHION 
IF IT 
DIDN'T WORK 
QUITE 
HE WOULD 
STILL HAVE THE RED 
NEAR THE POCKET YOU HAVE TO MAKE 
SURE YOU GET THE CANNON PERFECTLY 
OTHERWISE YOU WILL NOT BE ON THE 
RED 
TAKES A BIT OF PUTTING OUT OF YOUR 
MIND AN EASY MISS LIKE THE ONE JOE 
PLAYED 
HE HAS GOT TO JUST HOPE THAT HE 
GETS ANOTHER CHANCE THAT DOESN'T 
HALF SAT YOUR CONFIDENCE SAP 
YOUR CONFIDENCE 
NICE CUE ACTION LOOKED VERY 
COMPACT JUST ASKING FOR THE WHITE 
TO BE CLEANED THAT USUALLY SAYS 
THAT THE PLAYER IS GOING TO PLAY A 
SLOW ROLL THROUGH WHEN THEY ASK FOR 
THE WHITE TO BE CLEANED EARLIER ON 
HE WAS PLAYING A GAP BETWEEN THE 
TWO REDS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SHOW 
YOU ON HAWK EYE WHAT HE WAS 
THINKING HE WAS TRYING TO PLAY 
THAT TO GO UP FOR BLUE OR YELLOW AS 
A SHOT TO NOTHING BUT HE SMASH 
THEM TO SMITHEREENS AND 
JOE SHOULD 
PROBABLY HAVE 
GONE ON TO SCORE 
HEAVILY HE MISSED THE EASY BACK 
BLACK WHICH WE HAVE SHOWN YOU A 
COUPLE OF TIMES IF HE GETS THE 
KISS RIGHT HE PUSHES IT INTO PLAY 
IF HE DOESN'T HE STILL HAS THE 
CHANCE OF BEING ON THE ONE INTO THE 
OTHER CORNER YOU WOULD PLAY THE 
CANNON WOULDN'T YOU DENNIS 
THERE 
YES ABSOLUTELY HE HAS JUST THERE ROLLED IT IN SO HE IS GOING TO 
HAVE TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER CHANCE A 
LITTLE STUN SHOT ON TO THE RED THAT 
IS NEAR THE 
MIDDLE POCKET 
THERE 
WOULD 
HAVE BROUGHT 
THAT INTO 
PLAY 
AND HE 
WOULD 
BE GUARANTEED 
TO 
BE ON 
THE ONE THAT HE IS ON TO THE MIDDLE 
POCKET BUT HE IS DOING IT HIS WAY 
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'M GOING TO 
TELL HIM OFF A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE 
HE SHOULD HAVE LOOKED AT 
THE SCORE 
BOARD 
NOW IF 
HE DOESN'T 
GET 
ANGLE 
ON THE 
PINK NOW IT 
IS END 
BREAK SO WE HAD TO PLAY 
THE KISS 
I 
THINK HE 
HAS GOT THE ANGLE NOW 
OR HAS HE YES HE CAN NOW GO OVER 
AND MOVE THE RED 
IF THIS WORKS OUT YOU CAN'T REALLY 
CRITICISE HIM IT HASN'T SO NOW 
YOU WILL PROBABLY GIVE HIM A LITTLE 
TELLING OFF WILLIE 
THE ONLY 
REASON BEEN HE WAS GOING TO BE ON 
THE OTHER RED PLAYING THE PREVIOUS 
KISS YOU'RE STILL ON THE RED HE 
HAS JUST POTTED REGARDLESS OF WHAT 
KISS YOU GET HE PUT ALL HIS EGGS 
IN ONE BASKET THE MATTER HOW GOOD 
YOU ARE YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE 
GETTING THE RIGHT KISS NO MATTER 
HOW GOOD YOU ARE 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
DOUBLE CAN YOU BELIEVE IT 
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL A BACK DOUBLE 
BECAUSE THE REDS ARE SAFE THAT WAS 
THE REASON HE TOOK IT ON 
WHAT A CLEVER SHOT HE PLAYED THERE 
HE PLAYED ONE PUB POSITIONAL SHOT 
BUT THAT WAS CLEVER THINKING 
PUTTING YELLOW SAFE HE PLAYED 
ONE BAD POSITIONAL SHOT AND HE GOT 
THE SNOOKER AT THE SAME TIME 
BECAUSE THE YELLOW IS SAFE HE CAN 
TAKE THIS ON WITH LITTLE 
CONFIDENCE KNOWING IT IS UNLIKELY 
JOE WILL CLEAR EVEN IF HE MISSES 
THE RED AND THIS IS FRAME BALL 
WHAT HE NEEDS TO LEARN IN THE 
TACTICAL BREAK BUILDING DEPARTMENT 
HE DOESN'T NEED TO LEARN IN IN THE 
OTHER TO PALMER IN THE OTHER 
DEPARTMENT 
MID SESSION INTERVAL DEPARTMENT COMING UP AND HE HAS WON THE 
IMPORTANT FRAME THAT PUTS HIM JUST 
ONE AWAY FROM A PLACE IN THE 
QUARTER FINAL 
HE CAME INTO THE QUARTER FINAL AUDITORIUM SEVEN TO NINE IN FRONT BARRING 
SNOOKERS HE WILL GO INTO THE NEXT 
INTERVAL AT TWELVE EIGHT THAT WAS THE 
IN OFF THAT IS THE ONLY REASON WHY 
JOE SWAIL IS NOW COMING BACK TO THE 
TABLE HE NEEDS TWO SNOOKERS HE 
MIGHT NOT HAVE CARRIED ON BAR THE 
IN OFF 
ANOTHER SUPERB LONG POPPED LONG 
POT 
JOE SWAIL IS NOW RESIGNED TO THE 
FACT THAT THIS FRAME IS OVER HE 
HAS GOT HIS CLOTH READY TO WALK OUT 
HE KNOWS HE HAS TO DO WHAT HE HAS 
DONE BEFORE AT THE CRUCIBLE WIN 
THE REMAINING FIVE FRAMES TO WIN 
THE RED IS NOT THERE AND SO I'M 
SURE JOE SWAIL WILL CONCEDE NOW HE 
HAS 
ONE FRAME AWAY FROM THE PLACE IN 
THE QUARTER FINALS OF THE WORLD 
SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIP STOP IT WAS 
FASCINATING DURING THAT 
FRAME TO 
LISTEN 
TO DENNIS 
AND WILLIE 
COMMENTATING ON 
SHOT SELECTION 
AND 
LISTENING TO YOU TALKING ABOUT IT 
HERE THE CHINESE PLAYERS IN SOME 
REGARDS PLAY THE GAME SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT IT 
YES I AGREE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
WITH WILLIE WHICH WILL MEAN I WILL 
HAVE TO GO AND LIE DOWN WILLIE IS 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CORRECT HE PLAYED ON THE 
LOOSE ONE AND THEN TRY TO GET ON IT 
LATER ON THEY PLAY A DIFFERENCE 
START OTHER PEOPLE 
HOW WOULD YOU 
DESCRIBE THE STYLE IS IT 
FLAMBOYANT DOES HE TAKE MORE 
CHANCES HE GOES FOR LOTS OF PLANTS 
HE'S ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR THINGS 
IN THE BUNCH BUT I HAVE TO GO BACK 
IN THAT FRAME WHEN JOE SWAIL WAS 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AND EIGHT BEHIND WHAT A BLACK HE 
MISSED HE WILL BE APSLEY KICKING 
HIMSELF HE MISSED THIS THIS CAN 
ONLY BE HIM TAKING HIS EYE OFF THE 
BALL WHEN WE KNOW JOE HAS GOT GREAT BATTLING QUALITIES IF HE HAD 
ONLY BEEN 
TWO BEHIND AND NOW HE IS FOUR 
BEHIND IT IS A DOUBLE WHAMMY IN 
THAT SITUATION 
YOU MISS AN EASY 
POT AND THEN LIANG WENBO 
HAS THE 
SHOTS 
YOU AND YOU 
AND YOU HAVE TO SIT AND WATCH HIM AND DID GETS 
MAGNIFIED 
THE CONCLUSION OF THIS MAGNIFIED MATCH STILL TO COME THE WINNER 
PLAYS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IN THE 
QUARTER FINALS ALSO PLAYING FOR A 
PLACE IN THE LAST EIGHT FROM 
BASILDON STUART BINGHAM THE WORLD 
TWENTY THREE COME UP AGAINST JOE PERRY FROM 
CAMBRIDGE THE WORLD NUMBER EIGHTEEN JOE 
TOTALLY FOCUSED ON PERFORMING TO 
HIS VERY BEST HERE IN SHEFFIELD 
I DON'T WANT TO TURN UP AND GET 
BEATEN BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT IS IN 
FULL SWING TO NOW STILL BE 
INVOLVED IS WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO 
DO L. AM STILL IN IT 
AND I'M HAPPY AND LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING IT 
IS DEFINITELY THE BEST I'VE PLAYED 
AT THE CRUCIBLE FOR QUITE A LONG 
TIME SUFFERED A COUPLE OF HEAVY FIRST ROUND DEFEATS THE 
LAST COUPLE 
OF YEARS TO 
WIN 
AT OF 
WAY AND 
PLAY AS 
GOOD 
AS I 
DID WAS 
REALLY PLEASING FOR ME 
I HAVE 
FEW UPS 
AND IF 
YOU 
DOWNS AT 
THE 
CRUCIBLE LIKE MOST PLAYERS YOU 
PLAY EVERY SESSION LIKE THE LAST 
AND STILL DON'T BEEN THE MATCH IS 
LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE A BAD SESSION 
DROPPING TWO FRAMES BEHIND IS NOT 
THE END OF THE MATCH YOU CAN DIG 
YOURSELF 
OUT OF 
A WHOLE 
I STILL 
THINK THE 
WAY THE 
GAME IS TODAY 
YOU CAN'T 
AFFORD 
ONE BAD 
SESSION 
SO THE PRESSURE IS ON FROM THE WORD 
GO WE ARE BOTH UP FOR THE BATTLE 
AND READY FOR WHAT PEOPLE ARE 
PREPARED TO THROW AT US IT IS NOT 
NICE WHEN 
PEOPLE 
COME BACK 
AT 
BUT TO 
COME THROUGH 
THE OTHER 
SIDE 
AND COME OUT WITH VICTORIES IS 
ALWAYS PLEASING WE BOTH KNOW WE 
HAVE THAT PART OF OUR GAME IN GOOD 
ORDER JUST HOPE THE REDS REST 
CLICKS INTO PLACE WHO WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT 
THOSE PLAYERS WOULD HAVE GOT THEIR 
NAMES ON THE TROPHY THERE WILL 
PROVE THEY ARE GOOD ENOUGH IT 
GIVES EVERYONE THAT EXTRA BIT OF 
BELIEF THAT 
IT IS 
THERE 
EVERYONE IF YOU CAN FIND 
YOUR BEST 
FORM AND 
FIND A BIT 
OF LUCK 
IN 
THESE TWO WEEKS MAYBE WE CAN ALL 
FULFIL OUR DREAMS 
IT'S WAS FIVE TO THREE TO STUART 
AT THE 
END 
OF THE OPENING SESSION BUT AS THE 
MATCH DEVELOPED IT MOVED ON TO NINETY SEVEN 
JOE THE BIGGEST TO BREAKS OF 
SESSION CAME IN THE LAST TWO FRAMES 
NINE TO SEVEN JOE AND THEY CAME INTO THE 
CRUCIBLE THIS EVENING IT HAS MOVED 
ON TO FRAME NINETEEN JOE TO PLAY TEN TO EIGHT 
COMMENTARY BY CLIVE EVERTON AND 
TERRY GRIFFITHS 
THE SECOND ONE OF THOSE HE HAS 
PLAYED IN THIS EVENING'S SESSION 
CAUGHT IT TOO THICK BETTER THAN 
THE OTHER WAY MIND CATCH IT TOO 
THIN AND THE WHITE CAN KOREA INTO 
THE REDS 
WELL PLAYED FULLY COMMITTED TO THE 
SHOT HE KNEW HE WOULD BE LEAVING 
THE TABLE OF FOUR OPEN IF HE HAD 
MISSED IT 
BINGHAM ONE OF QUITE A FEW PLAYERS 
IN CONTENTION FOR A TOP SIXTEEN PLACE AT 
THE END OF SEASON RANKINGS 
DEPENDING ON THEIR OWN RESULTS AND 
OTHER RESULTS HE HAS NEVER BEEN A 
MEMBER OF THE ELITE HIGHEST EVER 
RANKING TWENTY THREE BUT HE IS A GOOD SOLID PERFORMER 
THEY HAVE BEEN A FEW TIMES ON THE 
PROVISIONAL RANKINGS THAT HE HAS 
LOOKED ENORMOUS CERTAINTY FOR THE 
TOP SIXTEEN THERE HAVE BEEN FEW 
TIMES BUT HE HAS NEVER GOT OVER 
THE LINE SO TO SPEAK WE WERE 
TALKING THIS MORNING KNOW THERE 
ARE LOT OF AWARDS FOR GETTING THE 
TOP SIXTEEN THE RANKING POINTS THE 
PRIZE MONEY GUARANTEED INVITATIONS 
TO ME IT IS FOR PEOPLE LIKE STUART 
BINGHAM IF HE GETS IN THERE IT 
MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE ONE OF THE TOP 
PLAYERS IT GIVES YOU THAT YOU 
ARE WITH THE BIG BOYS IN EVERY 
TOURNAMENT WHEN YOU TURN UP AND 
THINK THAT WILL PUSH STUART ON A 
BIT HE LOOKED A GOOD PROSPECT WHEN 
HE WON 
AMATEUR AND CAME 
INTO THE PROFESSIONAL GAME YES YES WHO WON THE WORLD AMATEUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP IN NEW ZEALAND HE WON 
HE WON THE WORLD AMATEUR IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX 
AND HE LOST IN THE FINAL THE 
FOLLOWING YEAR IN BULAWAYO TO MARCO 
FU 
HE HAS HAD SOME VERY GOOD MOMENTS 
AS A PROFESSIONAL BUT HAS TENDED 
NOT TO STITCH THEM TOGETHER 
HAS AN ANGLE ON THE PINK TO CANNON 
THE BUNCH FORTY FIVE TOUCHING BALL 
BUT IT IS NOT TOUCHING THE BALL 
THAT BINGHAM IS INTERESTED IN BUT 
THE REFEREE HAS TO DECLARE IT 
HE HASN'T HAD MANY PROBLEMS IN THIS 
BREAK AFTER THAT SPIT HE HAS HAD 
SOME VERY GOOD POSITIONAL SHOTS 
THAT IS THE SECRET KEEP IT EASY 
TAKE THE PRESSURE AWAY BLACK AND ONE MORE RED REQUIRED 
THE APPLAUSE RECOGNISING THAT HE IS 
EFFECTIVELY OVER THE LINE IN THIS 
FRAME 
PERRY'S LEAD IS GOING TO BE REDUCED 
TO A SINGLE FRAME 
BINGHAM RECENTLY BECAME THE TWENTY SIX 
AHH PLAYER TO COMPILE A CENTURY 
OF CENTURIES THE TWENTY SIXTH PLAYER TO 
COMPILE A CENTURY OF CENTURIES AND 
HE IS IN A VERY GOOD POSITION TO 
ADD TO THAT TALLY 
THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY IN THE TOURNAMENT 
FORTIETH THE FRAME IS ALREADY WON 
THIS EFFORT IS A CONTRIBUTION 
TOWARDS A NEW RECORD NUMBER OF 
CENTURIES POSSIBLY THE RECORD FOR 
THE CHAABI CHIP IS SIXTY EIGHT FOR THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP IS SIXTY EIGHT THIS IS NUMBER 
FORTY WITH THE QUARTER FINALS SEMI 
FINALS AND FINAL STILL TO COME 
A TOTAL CLEARANCE OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN BY STUART 
BINGHAM BRINGS IN JUST ONE FRAME 
BEHIND 
ANYONE TO MATCH ALL TO PLAY FOR 
STUART BINGHAM NOW STANDS THIRD IN 
THE LIST OF HIGHEST BREAK 
LIANG WENBO HAS MADE THE FORTY FIRST 
CENTURY SIXTY IT IS THE RECORD FOR 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP BACK TO THE 
JOE SWAIL AGAINST LIANG WENBO MATCH 
SIXTY EIGHT IT HAS BEEN A EVENTFUL 
CHAMPIONSHIP FOR LIANG WENBO HE IS 
BASED IN SHEFFIELD OF COURSE HE 
MISSES HOME BUT HE IS DELIGHTED TO 
BE HERE 
LIANG WENBO IS ONE FRAME AWAY FROM 
A PLACE IN THE QUARTER FINALS OF 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP HE IS NOT 
ACTUALLY HE NOW HAS SO FAR BACK TO 
DENNIS TAYLOR AND WILLIE THORNE 
JOE SWAIL WE HAVE BEEN CALLING HIM 
THE COMEBACK KID CAN HE DO WITH 
ONE MORE TIME CAN HE DO IT 
AGAIN ONE FRAME AT AT TIME THAT 
IS THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU COULD PLAY 
YOU CAN PLAY 
LIANG WENBO COMING AROUND TO SEE IF 
THE BLACK IS AVAILABLE IF HE TAKES 
THE POT ON IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE 
WHITE WOULD GO TOWARDS THE BLACK 
AND GET A LITTLE CLOSE TO IT IT 
DEPENDS ON THE ANGLE 
HE DID NOT FULLY COMMIT BECAUSE HE 
KNEW HE WOULD LEAVE THE RED NEXT TO 
THE BLACK WELL DONE 
IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO DROP ON THE RED 
THAT IS NEXT THE BLACK NEXT TO 
THE BLACK IF HE CAN DROP IT IN HE 
WOULD FINISH ON THAT RED IT 
DEPENDS ON THE ANGLE HE MAY ELECT 
TO GO INTO THEM THAT IS THE WAY HE 
HAS PLAYED IT AND HE IS O. K. 
THIS CLEARS THE BLACK WHICH WOULD 
BE AVAILABLE INTO BOTH POCKET THIS 
IS AS GOOD CHANCE AS JOE SWAIL 
HAS HAD THIS EVENING HE HAD A 
BREAK OF SIXTY FIVE IN THE ONLY FRAME HE 
WON BUT THAT WOULD LATER IN THE 
FRAME THAT WAS LATER IN THE 
FRAME HE NEEDS TO LET LIANG WENBO 
KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT LIE DOWN IF 
HE CAN MAKE A FRAME HERE HE IS 
BACK IN THE GAME HE IS JUST ABOUT O. K. THERE THE PINK IS ALSO AVAILABLE IT IS NOT A GOOD ANGLE 
IDEALLY HE WOULD LIKE THE PINK TO 
GO ON ITS OWN SPOT 
NO REAL PROBLEM TO GO FOR THE BLUE 
THE RIGHT THE RED TO THE RIGHT OF 
THE PINK WILL DEFINITELY POT IN THE 
CORNER 
IT IS ALL ABOUT THE ANGLE THERE IS 
ONE RED AVAILABLE IN THE MIDDLE BUT 
HE NEEDS AN ANGLE ON THE BLACK IT LOOKS TO BE STRAIGHT AGAIN 
I THINK THAT WAS A POOR CONTACT HE 
HAS GOT A LONG WAY TO TRAVEL 
I DO NOT KNOW IF HE CAN FORCE THE 
BLUE IN IF HE HAS GOT ENOUGH ANGLE 
HE MIGHT TRY TO MISS THE YELLOW AND 
COME BACK INTO THE REDS THERE IS 
VERY LITTLE HOLES AVAILABLE HE IS 
LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE IS A PLANT 
IF THERE IS A PLANT ON HE CAN JUST 
SCREW BACK THE PLANT MUST BE ON 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT JOE SWAIL WHEN HE 
IS UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE THAT HE 
ALWAYS SEEMS TO PLAY HIS BEST 
SNOOKER SNOOKER THE STANDARD THIS EVENING HAS BEEN 
SUPERB 
I MENTIONED EARLIER IN THIS FRAME 
IF JOE SWAIL COULD WIN FRAME IN 
ONE VISIT IT WOULD LET LIANG WENBO 
KNOW HE IS NOT GOING TO LIE DOWN 
THAT WAS FRAME BALL NOW CAN WILL 
CONCENTRATE AND GET HIS 
FIRST 
CENTURY OF 
THE SEASON OBVIOUSLY HE 
CENTURY OF THE SEASON OBVIOUSLY HE HAS MADE HUNDREDS IN PRACTICE 
HE JUST OF THE BLUE AT THE MINUTE THIS 
HAS BEEN 
AN EXCELLENT 
BREAK 
THIS HAS BEEN AN EXCELLENT BREAK H. E. DESERVES A CENTURY FANTASTIC FROM JOE SWAIL 
THIS CRUCIBLE CROWD HAVE BEEN 
TREATED TO SOME SNOOKER TODAY THIS 
IS EXCELLENT SNOOKER WE HAVE 
ALREADY HAD BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE FROM YANG ONE BALL LIANG WENBO 
A SUPERB EFFORT FROM JOE SWAIL TO 
KEEP HIMSELF IN THIS YEAR'S WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP THAT WAS MAGNIFICENT 
A BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE WE COLIN THE 
COMEBACK KID THAT WAS AMAZING THE 
KEY TO THE FRAME WAS WHEN HE 
FINISHED A LITTLE BIT SHORT ON THE 
BLUE HE WAS IN THIS POSITION L. 
THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GO 
OFF THE BLUE MISSED THE YELLOW AND 
GOT BACK INTO THE PACK THEN HE 
SPOTTED A PLANT 
YES HE DECIDED IF HE COULD POT 
POTTED ANYWHERE NEAR THE CIRCLE IT 
WOULD BE EASY 
THAT WAS THE KEY THE PLANT GOES IN 
AND HE CLEARS THE TABLE 
THE WAY HE PLAYED THE REST OF THE 
BREAK WAS ABSOLUTELY TOP DRAWER 
LOOK WHAT HE DOES WITH THE CUE BALL 
THAT ONE SHOT RED HE COULD WIN THE 
FRAME IN ONE VISIT HE IS ONE OF 
THOSE PLAYERS WHO DOES NOT ALWAYS 
WIN FRAME IN ONE VISIT HE DID 
THAT THERE JUST IN THE RIGHT TIME 
JUST LETTING LIANG WENBO ALL KNOW 
THAT HE IS STILL IN THE MATCH 
LIANG WENBO 
THE STANDARD OF THIS EVENING'S 
SESSION HAS BEEN TOP DRAWER BREAKS 
OF FIFTY IN EVERY GAME FRAME 
WHATLEY END WHEN BALL WOULD NOT 
GIVE FOR ANOTHER SIZEABLE BREAK TO 
GET HIMSELF INTO THE QUARTER FINALS 
AGAINST THE LEGEND THAT IS RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN O'SULLIVAN LIANG WENBO JUST WANTS TO GET A 
CHANCE NOW IT WAS NOT THE BEST OF 
BREAK OFF SHOT JOE SWAIL IF HE 
TAKES THIS ON HE KNOWS HE HAS GOT 
TO GET IT THERE IS A GAP 
HE HAS NOT GOT THE WHITE BACK FAR 
ENOUGH 
EARLIER IN THE MATCH LIANG WENBO 
WAS NOT IN THIS TYPE OF SHOT IN HE 
NEEDS ONE FRAME TO GET THROUGH TO 
THE QUARTER FINAL LET'S SEE HOW 
CLOSE HE GETS PRETTY GOOD TO ME 
IN HIS LITTLE INTERVIEW HE WAS 
SAYING HE IS JUST GOING TO PLAY ONE 
SHARP AT THE TIME NOW HE HAS GOT 
TO THIS STAGE HE IS DELIGHT TO 
ENJOY HIMSELF 
THAT WAS BIG SHOT TO PLAY AT 
FIRST GLANCE I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING 
TO SCREW BACK BUT HE WENT ALL OUT 
FOR BLACK OR PINK 
HE HAS GIVEN HIMSELF A TERRIFIC 
OPPORTUNITY HERE THERE AT LEAST 
FOUR MORE REDS AVAILABLE 
HE LOOKS IN CONTROL OF HIS EMOTIONS 
THIS YOUNG MAN THIS IN NEXT TEN 
MINUTES SHOULD HE STAY AT THE 
TABLE WILL BE THE BIGGEST TEN 
MINUTES OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S CAREER 
SO FAR HE GOT INTO THE QUARTER 
FINAL OF THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
AND PLAY THE PLAYER WE LIKE TO 
WATCH THE MOST 
I THINK IF HE DOES WIN THIS FRAME 
AND GET THROUGH TO PLAY RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN WHO IS A SUPERSTAR IN 
CHINA HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE 
TUNED IN TO THAT SANS SOME 
DESPITE SOME WERE BEATEN ONE HUNDRED AND 
TWO HUNDRED MILLION YOU WOULD THINK 
THERE IS STILL ONE LOOSE RED ON THE 
RIGHT HAND SIDE HE DOES THAT HAVE 
TO LEAVE AN ANGLE TO GO INTO THEM 
IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO GO INTO 
THEM IF HE CAN IF HE CAN MISS THE 
FIRST TWO REDS AND PLAY THE DEEP 
SCREW SCREW WE HAVE SEEN HIM PLAY THIS SHOT SO 
MANY TIMES HE PLAYS IT SO WELL 
WATCH THE WHITE DID NOT QUITE 
CATCH AT THAT TIME IT WAS BUT A 
GOOD PACK TO GO INTO 
I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO MISS THOSE 
FIRST TWO REDS HE IS LOOKING AT A 
POTTING ANGLE THERE ARE NOT MANY 
PLAYERS WHO WOULD TAKE A POT ON 
HERE A SAFETY SHOT IS VERY SIMPLE 
HE LIKES TO HAVE A GO HE STILL TOOK THE POT ON 
THERE ARE NOT MADE PLAYERS WHO 
WOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT ON NOT 
MANY PLAYERS SOMETIMES YOU GET 
OVER EXCITED AND TRYING TO GET OVER 
THE WINNING LINE A LITTLE TOO 
QUICKLY THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE 
CASE THERE HE HAS UNDERHIT THAT SOMEWHAT 
WHAT A SUPERB SHOT THAT WAS QUITE 
AMAZING WHEN YOU THINK HE HAS GOT 
TO WIN THIS MATCH TO GIVE HIMSELF A 
CHANCE TO STAY IN THE TOP SIXTEEN IF HE 
USES HE IS OUT OF THE ELITE TOP SIXTEEN 
LOSES MAYBE LIANG WENBO IS NOW 
WISHING HE HAD TAKING YOUR ADVICE 
AND PLAYED ADD GOOD SAFETY SHOT 
IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT POT DURING 
THE REST OF THE MATCH HE HAS BEEN 
GETTING AWAY WITH THOSE THIS TIME 
JOE SWAIL HAS ONCE AGAIN CREATED 
THE CHANCE TO WIN THE FRAME AT THIS 
VISIT AND THAT WOULD MAKE HIM 
THINK AT TWELVE TO TEN 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY THIS IS THE 
BEST JOE SWAIL HAS PLAYED IN THE 
MATCH SO FAR THE PREVIOUS FRAME 
WITH THAT MIGHT BE THE SENT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE 
THIS 
BEST HE HAS CUED IN THE 
THIS IS THE BEST HE HAS CUED IN THE MATCH 
IT JUST SHOWS YOU WHAT A GREAT 
TEMPERAMENT HE HAS HE HAS GREAT 
BATTLING QUALITIES 
THE ONE JUST BELOW THE PINK WILL 
POT AS WELL THIS IS THE KIND OF 
SHOT TO PLAY FOR TWO REDS AGAIN 
HE HAS GONE ALL OUT AND PLAYED FOR 
ONE WHICH IS NOT A PROBLEM 
THAT DEVELOPED THE THREE REDS HE 
IS TEN POINTS IN FRONT 
IF HE COULD SCORE ENOUGH HERE 
WITHOUT NEEDING BE DIFFICULT RED 
THAT IS THE TOP ONE NEAR THE CORNER 
POCKET THE ONE NEAR THE CUSHION IS 
O. K. FOR JOE SWAIL BEING RIGHT 
HANDED 
IT AMAZES ME HOW JOE SWAIL MANAGES 
TO FIND HIS BEST FORM AT THE RIGHT 
TIME A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY THE 
WRONG TIME OF COURSE BUT IT IS 
THE RIGHT TIME HE CANNOT AFFORD 
ANY BAD FORM HE NEEDS TO WIN EVERY 
FRAME 
AS ALWAYS JOE SWAIL IS MAKING A 
HUGE FIGHT HE IS NOT GIVING IN TO 
THE END WHEN BOWL ON THE OTHER 
TABLE STUART BINGHAM HAS BEEN 
TRYING TO MAKE A FIGHT OF IT BUT 
JOE PERRY LOOKS AS THOUGH HE IS 
GOING TO GET OVER THE LINE 
HE HAS GOT THE CHANCE OF A 
CLEARANCE STUART BINGHAM MISSED A 
SIMPLE RED HE HAS LEFT JOE PERRY 
WITH FOUR REDS LEFT THIS IS THE 
BIG SHOT 
IF HE POTS THIS HE WILL WIN THE 
FRAME GREAT SHOT 
B. B. C. JOE PERRY AS THE CANDIDATE TO 
MAKE STEADY PROGRESS CUE MATT HE 
WILL BE IN THE QUARTER FINALS 
AGAINST STEPHEN MAGUIRE AND HE WILL 
BE FULL OF CONFIDENCE 
A TOUGH MATCH OBVIOUSLY MAGUIRE'S 
FAVOURITE 
JOE PERRY ON THE THRESHOLD OF A 
PLACE IN THE QUARTER FINALS OF 
STOCK GREAT CLEARANCE SO FAR 
CONGRATULATIONS DE JOE PERRY THAT 
IS LIVE HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE HE IS 
IN THE LAST EIGHT OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP CHAMPIONSHIP YOU CAN SEE THE RELIEF I'M NOT 
SURPRISED AT THIS STAGE GET THE 
WIN MAKE SOME PROGRESS AND IT 
COULD BE YOUR YEAR KIN FANTASTIC 
TO START THE DAY LOSING VERY WELL 
PLAYED PLAYED AS FAR AS THE OTHER GAME IS 
CONCERNED JOE SWAIL IS MAKING A 
HUGE BITE OF THIS CUE HE ALWAYS 
DOES DOES IT SEEMS BIZARRE THAT YOU SHOULD 
PLAY YOUR BEST SNOOKER AT THIS 
STAGE SUPERB LOOKS LIKE HE IS 
MAKING ANOTHER BREAK IT IS A LONG 
WAY FROM BEING OVER 
THAT IS JUST ABOUT IT PRESS THE 
RED BUT NOW IT IS SEE THE 
CONCLUSION OF THE JOE SWAIL AND 
LIANG WENBO MATCH OTHERWISE WE'RE 
BACK AT ELEVEN TWENTY P. M. WITH A ROUND UP OF 
DAY TEN OF THE CHAABI TIP WE CLOSE 
IN OUR SERIES OF WHERE THEY NOW 
WITH SEXY REX THE CHAMPIONSHIP
