IT MUST BE GREAT HAVING NO VICES VIVIEN 
IT JUST REQUIRES A LITTLE SELF CONTROL 
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BY NOW PERHAPS 
I'M JUST NOT SO SMUG AS TO THINK IT'S EASY 
I DIDN'T MEAN TO OFFEND 
YES WELL NO ONE SETS OUT TO BE AN ADDICT EITHER

I WAS JUST A BIT WORRIED WHEN YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT 
REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT DOC DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME OR ANYTHING 
THE THING IS I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THE ACAMPROSATE ANY MORE

IT'S ONLY BEEN SIX WEEKS AND I HAVEN'T TOUCHED A DROP 
THAT CAN CHANGE IN A MINUTE 
I SPOKE TO YOUR COUNSELLOR 
HE SAID YOU MISSED YOUR APPOINTMENT ON THE SECOND I DIDN'T MEAN TO 
MY MEMORY ISN'T THAT GOOD ANY MORE IT'S O. K. 
I'M HERE IF TONY NEEDS ME I'LL MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T DRINK ANY MORE 
I DON'T MEAN TO BE HARSH TONY BUT I'VE SEEN OTHER ADDICTS TRY AND KICK 
IT'S NOT EASY FOR THEM OR THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE 
IT'S ALL IN THE MIND 
HE'S GETTING STRONGER EVERYDAY 
YOU CAN REDUCE YOUR MEDICATION OVER TIME 
THEY SAID THE SAME ABOUT THE PAINKILLERS I WAS ON 
I'M SORRY IF YOU FEEL YOUR DOCTORS LET YOU DOWN 
I WOULDN'T PRESCRIBE ACAMPROSATE IF I DIDN'T FEEL YOU NEED IT 
C'MON I WAS THERE THE FIRST DAY YOU CAME INTO THE SURGERY 
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID 
THAT I'D DO ANYTHING TO GET ALI AND RAE BACK 
HAS THAT CHANGED 
O. K. DOC YOU BETTER MAKE OUT A NEW PRESCRIPTION 
GOOD 
I SHOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING EARLIER BUT I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK I WAS USELESS 
YOU'RE NOT DON'T WORRY 
I RECKON YOU NEED A P. H. D. SOMETIMES TO WORK THESE THINGS 
VIVIEN DID EXPLAIN IT TO ME 
YEAH IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES I CAN IMAGINE SHE DID THE SAME TO ME 
I RECKON SHE JUST BLAGS IT ANYWAY 
RIGHT WELL THIS SHOULD BE WORKING AGAIN NOW 
HOW'D YOU DO IT 
THE USUAL TRICK 
TURNED IT OFF AND ON A COUPLE OF TIMES AND GAVE IT A WHACK 
HAVE YOU GOT THOSE APPOINTMENTS I'LL INPUT THEM FOR YOU 
IT'S O. K. I CAN DO THAT 
BE MY GUEST 
IF JULIA HAD SEEN ME THIS MORNING I DOUBT SHE'D HAVE KEPT ME ON 
DON'T BE DAFT ANYWAY WHAT JULIA DON'T KNOW CAN'T HURT HER 
YOU FORGET SOMETHING NO NOT EXACTLY 
TONY HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN JUNIOR 
LONG ENOUGH TWO TOURS OF AFGHANISTAN 
SO YOU'VE SEEN SOME STUFF TOGETHER THEN YEAH 
TILL A GRENADE TORE THE GUTS OUT OF THE VEHICLE WE WERE IN 
IF THE BOOZE DON'T KILL ME THE SUSPENSE WILL 
I WONDERED WHY JUNIOR'S SELLING SINGLE PACKS OF CIGARETTES ON YOUR DOORSTEP 
HE'S GOT A MATE LONG DISTANCE LORRY DRIVER 
SURELY HE'D MAKE MORE MONEY SELLING THE CARTONS UNLESS HE'S SELLING SOMETHING ELSE IN THE PACKS 
LIKE WHAT 
COME OFF IT HE'S JUST TRYING TO MAKE A FEW QUID 
HAVE YOU WATCHED HIM SELLING 
JUNIOR WAS THROWN CLEAR WHEN THE GRENADE WENT OFF I WAS STUCK WITH A BANG ON THE HEAD 
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO COME BACK FOR ME BUT HE DID 
GOT ME OUT JUST BEFORE THE SECOND GRENADE HIT 
ALL I GOT WAS CONCUSSION JUNIOR ENDED UP WITH A BUNCH OF SHRAPNEL IN HIS KNEE 
HE CALLED ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO SAID HE NEEDED TO GET OUT OF BELFAST AND CAN I HELP 
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE MAN THAT JUST SAVED YOUR LIFE 
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T KNOW YOU PEOPLE HAVE GOT NO IDEA 
WE FIGHT YOUR WARS AND YOU SWAN AROUND LIKE NOTHING'S HAPPENING 
KICKING AN ADDICTION ISN'T LIKE FIGHTING A WAR OH YEAH AND YOU'D KNOW THAT HOW 
YOU KNOW WHAT STICK YOUR PILLS 
JUNIOR LOOKS OUT FOR ME BECAUSE HE'S MY MATE 
NOT BECAUSE HE'S PAID TO 
ALL YOU LOT AT THE MILL ARE SO PROFESSIONAL YOU MUST THINK I DON'T HAVE A CLUE 
WE'RE ALL HUMAN 
VIVIEN'S A DRAGON 
GEORGE IS A BIT OF A HIPPY 
AND JIMMI'S GOT GIRL PROBLEMS 
YEAH O. K. BUT YOU'RE ALL SO GOOD 
I MEAN YOU RUN TWO NURSING CLINICS AND YOU'RE STILL REALLY YOUNG 
IT DOESN'T MEAN I HAVEN'T MADE MISTAKES THOUGH LIKE WHAT 
O. K. WELL WHEN I FIRST STARTED I HAD THIS REALLY FIT GUY COME IN 
NEEDING A JAB IN HIS BUM 
HE HAD LIKE BUNS OF STEEL 
BUT EVERY TIME I PUT THE NEEDLE IN I KEPT HITTING MUSCLE 
AND IT JUST KEPT POPPING BACK OUT 
THE POOR GUY WAS IN TEARS BY THE END OF IT STILL ASKED HIM OUT THOUGH 
SAID I COULD MAKE HIM FEEL ALL BETTER 
NO YOU DIDN'T YES I DID 
IT ALL JUST COMES DOWN TO CONFIDENCE 
MAYBE 
THE WANDERER RETURNS I TRUST YOUR ADVENTURES WENT WELL 
NOT REALLY 
HAS MR. CRAWFORD RELAPSED 
NOT YET BUT I MIGHT HAVE PUSHED HIM TOWARDS IT 
BY SUGGESTING HIS BEST MATE IS A DRUG DEALER 
AND IS HE 
I DON'T KNOW 
JUNIOR TONY'S SO CALLED BEST MATE 
IS SELLING CIGARETTES FROM HIS HOUSE BUT SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT 
WHAT DOES YOUR PATIENT MAKE OF IT 
WELL JUNIOR SAVED HIS LIFE IN AFGHANISTAN SO HE'S A HERO 
SO YOU THINK JUNIOR'S GOT TONY DEPENDENT ON HIM 
THE MAN'S AN ALCOHOLIC HE'S A NEEDY CHARACTER 
JUNIOR'S CONVINCED TONY THAT HE DOESN'T NEED A REPEAT PRESCRIPTION 
AND TONY'S GOT EVERY REASON TO TRUST HIM 
SOUNDS A BIT LIKE CUCKOO ING TO ME 
SILLY NAME I HEARD ABOUT IT DOWN THE STATION GO ON 
A DEALER SUPPLIES FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S HOUSE 
POLICE MOVE IN DEALER PUTS THE BLAME ON THE WEAK TENANT 
THE DEALER WALKS THE TENANT IN THIS CASE TONY COULD END UP LOSING HIS HOUSE 
THAT'S IF HE DOESN'T END UP GOING TO JAIL 
GREAT SO HOW DO I PROVE JUNIOR'S DEALING 
HANG ON THERE COLOMBO YOU'RE IN A BIT DEEP THERE 
I CAN'T JUST TURN MY BACK NOBODY IGNORED ME WHEN I NEEDED HELP 
THAT'S TRUE 
IF JUNIOR IS DEALING THE POLICE MIGHT HAVE HIM UNDER SURVEILLANCE ALREADY 
IF TONY CO OPERATES THEN MAYBE NOTHING'D HAPPEN TO HIM 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR PAPERWORK 
I'LL DO IT LATER IF NECESSARY 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO STOP JUNIOR IF TONY WON'T LISTEN TO YOU 
VITAL FOR THE REGION CALLS FOR A HIGH SPEED RAIL LINK ALL THE WAY TO THE CHANNEL TUNNEL 
AND STILL CAMPAIGNING THE PIONEERING WOMEN WHO FORCED THE GOVERNMENT'S HAND ON HERCEPTIN' 
GOOD AFTERNOON SHUT UP SHUT UP 
SHUT UP SHUT UP OH NO 
IT'S ALL RIGHT I'M HERE HEY HEY 
I'M SORRY DON'T BE SILLY 
IT'S LIKE A MIGRAINE JUST COMES OUT OF NOWHERE 
AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN WHEN YOU'VE HAD A DRINK 
NO NOT AS MUCH 
WELL IT'LL HAVE TO BE A CUPPA FROM NOW ON O. K. 
I'LL GO 
I CAN SELL YOUR CIGGIES SIT YOURSELF DOWN 
WHAT 
THE DOCTOR RECKONS YOU'RE DEALING 
I'D LIKE WHATEVER HE'S BEEN SMOKING 
I OWE YOU BIG TIME YEAH 
BUT I CAN'T NO BUTS THE DOCTOR KNOWS I'M RIGHT ABOUT YOUR MEDICATION 
HE'S JUST TRYING TO TURN YOU AGAINST ME 
ARE YOU GOING TO GET THAT NO YOU CAN GO 
IT'S O. K. YOU'D BETTER 
GO PREFER YOU TO TRUST ME 
WHOEVER'S AT THE DOOR CAN CALL AGAIN SOME OTHER TIME 
OH PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY I'LL MAKE THE TEA AND YOU GET THE DOOR 
YOU SURE YEAH 
EASY ON THE BELL BROTHER YOU'LL WEAR IT OUT 
THANKS FOR COMING AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE MRS. CRAWFORD 
YOU MADE IT SOUND SO SERIOUS 
WHY COULDN'T YOU HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT IT ON THE PHONE 
I'D RATHER TALK TO YOU IN PERSON 
WHAT'S TONY DONE NOW HE'S STOPPED TAKING HIS ACAMPROSATE PRESCRIPTION 
AM I MEANT TO BE SURPRISED 
HE SEEMS TO BE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY AN OLD ARMY FRIEND 
HE'S COMPLETELY BLINKERED WHERE JUNIOR'S CONCERNED 
THE PROBLEM IS I THINK JUNIOR'S DEALING DRUGS BEHIND TONY'S BACK 
THAT'S RIDICULOUS THAT'S WHAT I'D HAVE THOUGHT IF I HADN'T SEEN THE WAY THAT JUNIOR ACTS 
I AM REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT TONY 
HIS VULNERABILITY HAS MADE IT EASIER FOR JUNIOR TO MANIPULATE HIM 
JUNIOR SAVED HIS LIFE 
HE'D PAY MORE ATTENTION TO WHAT JUNIOR SAYS THAN HE WOULD TO ME 
I'M NOT SO SURE TONY'S DESPERATE TO GET YOU AND RAE BACK IN HIS LIFE 
IF YOU COULD PERSUADE HIM TO RENEW HIS PRESCRIPTION MAYBE HE'D SEE WHAT JUNIOR'S UP TO 
ME AND RAE HAVE HAD A NEW START 
TONY'S A GOOD MAN HE CARES ABOUT RAE BUT IF I'M RIGHT HE COULD END UP IN PRISON 
WHAT FOR IF JUNIOR'S ARRESTED BUT THE DRUGS ARE FOUND IN TONY'S HOUSE 
THEN YOUR HUSBAND'S GOING TO BE THE ONE PRESUMED TO BE IN POSSESSION 
I DON'T WANT RAE THINKING HER DAD'S INTO DRUGS IT'S THE LAST THING SHE NEEDS EXACTLY 
PLEASE TELL ME I GET TO EXAMINE HIM 
SORRY HE'S DOCTOR WOODSON'S PATIENT 
TYPICAL BET YOU DIDN'T MIND TAKING DOWN HIS DETAILS 
NO WAY I'VE GOT A BOYFRIEND 
SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THE MENU DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO TRY ANYTHING 
ANYWAY I'LL LEAVE YOU TO ENJOY THE VIEW IT'S ONE OF THE PERKS 
ALI WHAT'S GOING ON 
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH RAE 
SHE'S AT SCHOOL I THOUGHT ALI COULD KNOCK SOME SENSE INTO YOU 
YOU DON'T GET IT DO YOU I'M FINE 
JUNIOR'S NOT LET ME HAVE ANYTHING STRONGER THAN A CUPPA 
I'VE JUST WATCHED HIM GIVE TWO LOTS OF KIDS CIGARETTES AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU I'M TALKING TO MY HUSBAND 
STILL CALL HIM THAT AFTER YOU RAN OUT CAN YOU TWO WAIT OUTSIDE PLEASE I'LL BEO L. T. FRO N. 
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS ISN'T A SOCIAL CALL 
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE COME WITH THE DOCTOR IF YOU DIDN'T CARE JUNIOR'S USING YOU I TRUST HIM 
HE UNDERSTANDS ME HE'S BEEN THERE THAT WAS ALWAYS THE PROBLEM 
NO ONE ELSE UNDERSTOOD WHAT HAPPENED IN AFGHANISTAN GOT THAT IN ONE 
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU NOT TALKING TO ANYONE 
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN MY HEAD 
NO BEING WITH A DRUNK WAS MUCH MORE FUN I'M NOT DRUNK NOW 
GIVE IT TIME 
I ONLY CAME HERE BECAUSE RAE MIGHT NEED HER DAD ONE DAY 
I'M GETTING BETTER NOW WHO ARE YOU KIDDING 
I LEFT YOU BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD CHANGE 
NOW IT'S OBVIOUS YOU CAN'T 
I CAN 
JUST LET ME SEE MY DAUGHTER PLEASE 
SHE STILL THINKS YOU'RE A HERO I DON'T WANT TO RUIN THAT 
HOW D'YOU THINK PEOPLE ROUND HERE ARE GOING TO FEEL WHEN THEY FIND OUT 
THEIR KIDS HAVE BEEN BUYING DRUGS FROM YOUR HOME THEY WON'T 
AND THIS IS NEVER JUST GONNA BE MY HOME 
NO I FORGOT IT'S JUNIOR'S TOO 
I HOPE YOU'LL BE HAPPY TOGETHER 
THAT DOCTOR'S GOT PLENTY TO ANSWER FOR 
DRAGGING ALI INTO THIS WAS OUT OF ORDER 
YOU TWO NEED SPACE NOT STRESS 
I'VE GOT TO ASK JUN ASK WHAT 
IF I'M DEALING 
AFTER EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH I NEED TO KNOW 
YOU THINK ANYONE ROUND HERE GAVE A MONKEYS WHEN WE WERE DUCKING ROUNDS 
SCARED THINKING WE'D NEVER MAKE IT IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT 
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING TO DO WITH IT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF DISABILITY ALLOWANCE I GET 
SOME ACCOUNTANT COMES UP WITH A FORMULA 
ONE LEG COSTS THIS ONE ARM COSTS THAT 
LOOKS LIKE I NEVER GOT HURT ENOUGH YOU CAN'T USE THAT AS AN EXCUSE 
YOU CAN'T BEGIN TO IMAGINE HOW MUCH YOU OWE ME 
YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY QUESTION 
WHAT IF I DO 
THEY NEED SOMETHING TO GET BY I NEED THE MONEY 
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE AND YOU'RE THE REASON WHY 
THERE MUST BE SOME SORT OF A JOB YOU'D BE DEAD WITHOUT ME 
I MIGHT AS WELL BE IF I CAN'T SEE RAE 
NOW LOOK I'M SORRY BUT I THINK IT'S BEST THAT YOU LEAVE 
OH I'M HERE TO STAY MATE 
GOT MY OWN KEYS THIS IS RAE'S ROOM 
D'YOU SEE HER 
I'M GOING TO CALL THE POLICE 
GONNA LET YOU INTO A SECRET 
THE POLICE ARREST ME AND I'LL IMPLICATE YOU 
NOW IF YOU'RE STRAIGHT WITH ME

IT WAS WEIRD WE HAD THE KARAOKE GOING WHEN HE CAME IN THE ROOM SHOUTING 
HE COULDN'T HANDLE ALL THE LIGHTS AND THE MUSIC 
HAS TONY EVER HAD HIS BRAIN TESTED 
TO SEE IF IT'S THERE 
TONY SAID THE ARMY DOCTORS THOUGHT HE HAD CONCUSSION AFTER THE BOMBING 
ANYWAY THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM NOW IS IT 
THEY MIGHT HAVE MISSED SOMETHING 
NO TONY'S HAD HIS CHANCE 
IF HE WON'T GET RID OF THAT MAN THERE'S NO WAY HE CAN SEE MY DAUGHTER 
THANKS FOR THE LIFT 
ALI WAIT 
LISTEN WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT TONY'S BEHAVIOUR 
IT MIGHT BE THAT HE SUFFERED MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN DAMAGE IN THE GRENADE ATTACK 
DOCTOR YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME I'LL BOOK HIM IN FOR AN M. R. I. SCAN 
IT COULD ALSO BE THAT HE'S SUFFERING FROM POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER 
WE CAN HAVE HIM ASSESSED FOR THAT TOO YOU CAN ASK HIM NOW 
WAIT
