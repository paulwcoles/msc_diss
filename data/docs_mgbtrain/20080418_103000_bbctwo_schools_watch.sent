WATCH THE WORLD GO ROUND 
HELLO I'M STUMP I MAKE PRINTS WITH INK OR PAINT 
I CAN MAKE ONE PRINT OR I CAN MAKE MANY PRINTS THAT ALL LOOK THE SAME 
I CAN PRINT IN ONE COLOUR OR MANY COLOURS AND I CAN REPEAT MYSELF 
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE PRINTS AND REPEAT THEM TO MAKE PATTERNS 
I'LL INK MYSELF UP AND PRESS MYSELF DOWN READY LET'S START THE ART 
HELLO I'M HESTER 
THIS IS MY PRINT OF A STARRY NIGHT 
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE IT 
I'M DRAWING LOTS OF STARS WITH LIGHT COMING OUT OF THEM 
ON A POLYSTYRENE BLOCK 
I ROLL MY ROLLER UP AND DOWN UNTIL I GET A STICKY SOUND 
LOOK HOW THE STARS SHOW UP 
I MUST PUT MY INKY ROLLER BACK IN THE TRAY 
WATCH HOW I'M GOING TO USE MY BLOCK 
TO MAKE A GOOD PRINT I HAVE TO PRESS HARD 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I TAKE THE TILE OFF 
I CAN MAKE STARS OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
JUST WATCH 
I HAVE TO PUT THE SECOND BLOCK RIGHT NEXT TO THE FIRST ONE 
I MUSTN'T OVERLAP THEM 
SO NOW YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE THE SAME PRINT OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
SEE I'VE MADE SOME PRINTS TOO 
I'VE ALSO MADE A BIT OF A MESS YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WITH INK 
I CAN FEEL A HANDY HINT COMING ON 
A GOOD WAY TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GET INK EVERYWHERE 
IS TO IMAGINE THERE'S A LINE DOWN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR TABLE 
KEEP YOUR PRINTING TOOLS ON ONE SIDE OF THE LINE 
AND THE CLEAN PAPER ON THE OTHER 
DON'T CROSS THE LINE AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE 
I'VE BEEN REPEATING MY PRINTS TO MAKE A PATTERN 
CAN YOU SEE THE PATTERN IT'S TWO GREEN FEET THEN ONE RED HAND 
THEN IT REPEATS ITSELF 
YOU CAN MAKE A PATTERN IN ANY COLOUR AND ANY SIZE YOU CAN GET IDEAS OF PATTERNS FROM THE WORLD AROUND YOU 
HI MY NAME'S OLIVER AND THIS IS MY WRAPPING PAPER PRINT 
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW I MADE IT 
I GET MY IDEAS FROM LOOKING CLOSELY AT FLOWERS 
I'M DRAWING MY DESIGN ON A POLYSTYRENE BLOCK 
I'M GOING TO MAKE A PATTERN USING TWO DIFFERENT BLOCKS 
I PUT A T. AT THE TOP SO I KNOW WHICH WAY UP TO PRINT MY DESIGN 
I'M GOING TO MAKE A PATTERN USING TWO DIFFERENT COLOURS 
I'M NUDGING INTO THE INK WITH MY ROLLER 
I'M ROLLING IT UNTIL IT MAKES A STICKY SOUND 
I HAVE TO PRESS HARD WITH MY ROLLER TO MAKE A GOOD PRINT 
I MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERLAP IT 
I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH MY PRINT 
I REALLY LIKE MY PATTERN AND THE PRINTS ARE LOVELY AND CLEAR 
THE SECRET OF A GOOD PRINT IS IN THE PRESSING 
THE TILE MUST BE COVERED ALL OVER WITH INK 
PLACE THE INKED SIDE DOWN ON THE PAPER 
TAKE A CLEAN ROLLER AND PRESS THE TILE FLAT PRESS HARD ALL OVER 
AND NOW IN THE MIDDLE FOR GREAT CLEAR PRINTS LARGE AND LITTLE 
PERFECT PRINTS EVERY TIME 
YOU CAN MAKE PRINTS WITH ALL SORTS OF THINGS LET'S LOOK AT STUDIO ART

FROM MY WINDOW I CAN SEE BUILDINGS OF ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES 
I'M SKETCHING WHAT I CAN SEE FROM MY WINDOW 
NOW I'VE GOT MY IDEA I'M GOING TO MAKE THE PRINT

BUT IT'S FULL OF WONDERFUL THINGS THAT CAN BE USED FOR PRINTING WITH 
PACKAGING 
AND HERE'S A BIT OF OLD PLASTIC 
NICE TEXTURE 
THIS HESSIAN IS VERY FINE BUT I THINK I CAN USE IT

NOW I CUT THE SHAPES AND SIZES OUT OF THE TEXTURES THAT I'VE CHOSEN 
I'LL USE THE PLASTIC FOR A BUILDING THE SQUARES LOOK LIKE WINDOWS 
I'M PRESSING DOWN FIRMLY TO MAKE SURE THE PRINT COMES OUT 
I'M MIXING INKS TO MAKE DIFFERENT COLOURS
