BEYOND THE REACH OF AID SUPPLIES 
AN APPEAL FOR URGENT ACTION 
THERE'S A REAL POTENTIAL RISK OF 
PUBLIC MASSIVE PUBLIC HEALTH 
CATASTROPHE 
A DRAMATIC FINAL DAY CATASTROPHE IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE MANCHESTER 
UNITED CLINCH THE TITLE AT WIGAN 
AND THE PARENTS OF MURDERED 
TEENAGER JIMMY MIZEN PAY TRIBUTE TO 
THEIR SON 
JIMMY WAS THE SWEETEST BOY YOU 
COULD EVER MEET 
JUST A FINE YOUNG MAN 
GOOD EVENING EIGHT DAYS AFTER 
BURMA FIRST FELT THE IMPACT OF ITS 
DEVASTATING CYCLONE AID AGENCIES 
ARE WARNING THAT IT FACES AN 
UNIMAGINABLE TRAGEDY THE ISSUE 
CONTINUES TO BE THE SPEEDY AND 
EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTION OF CRUCIAL 
AID SUPPLIES HERE THE FOREIGN 
SECRETARY DAVID MILIBAND HAS SAID 
HE WOULD BE AMAZED IF THE DEATH 
TOLL HAD NOT ALREADY REACHED 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THE B. B. C.'S LYSE 
DOUCET IS ON THE BURMA THAILAND 
BORDER AT MAE SOT AND SHE JOINS US 
LIVE LIVE AFTER MANY DAYS SPEAKING OF THEIR 
FRUSTRATION AID AGENCIES TONIGHT 
ARE HOLDING ON TO WHAT THEY SAY ARE 
SOME SMALL GLIMMERS OF HOPE THE 
MILITARY RULERS HAVE GIVEN A FEW 
MORE VISAS TO ENTER AND AID FLIGHTS 
ALLOWED TO LAND BUT IT'S STILL NOT 
A MATCH FOR THE CATASTROPHE SAID TO 
BE UNFOLD BE INSIDE BURMA 
CERTAINLY NOTHING TO PREVENT WHO 
COULD BE DESCRIBED AS A SECOND MAN 
MADE DISASTER THAT IS MORE 
DEATHS FROM DISEASE THAN THE 
CYCLONE ITSELF 
ANDREW HARDING NOW REPORTS 
MORE WEARY SURVIVORS EMERGING FROM 
THE CORPSE STREWN WATERS OF THE 
IRRAWADDY DELTA JOINING HUNDREDS 
MUCH THOUSANDS OTHERS NOW GATHERING 
IN MAKESHIFT CAMPS 
HERE SOME OF THE DEAD ARE FINALLY 
BURIED BURIED AS FOR THE INJURED MANY HAVE 
WAITED FOR THAN A WEEK FOR HELP 
THEIR WOUNDS ARE DANGEROUSLY 
INFECTED FOOD IS SCARCE HERE A 
CUP OF RICE PER FAMILY PER DAY AND 
NO SANITATION IN A LOT OF PLACES 
DEHYDRATION AND DISEASE ARE GAINING 
THE UPPER HAND 
WE'RE AFRAID 
THERE'S A REAL POTENTIAL RISK OF 
PUBLIC MASSIVE PUBLIC HEALTH 
CATASTROPHE WAITING TO HAPPEN IN 
MYANMAR 
BUT ON BURMESE STATE MYANMAR TELEVISION A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE 
THE PRIME MINISTER AND PARTY 
ARRIVED AT THE RELIEF CAMP FOR THE 
STORM VICTIMS 
THE GENERALS TOUR A 
CAMP STILL DETERMINED TO PROVE 
THAT THEY HAVE THIS CRISIS UNDER 
CONTROL CONTROL BUT LOOK AT THE REALITY AT 
RANGOON'S AIRPORT TODAY STILL NO 
SIGN EVEN OF A FORKLIFT TRUCK THE 
PLANES SLOWLY UNLOADED BY HAND 
IT'S TRUE THAT AID IS STARTING TO 
FLOW INTO THE COUNTRY BUT THE 
BURMESE MILITARY ARE SEIZING MOST 
OF IT REFUSING TO ALLOW FOREIGN 
TEAMS IN TO HELP 
THE RESULT IS SOME SUPPLIES ARE NOW 
GETTING TO THE SURVIVORS BUT 
NOWHERE NEAR FAST ENOUGH AND 
POLITICAL PRESSURE DOESN'T SEEM TO 
BE CHANGING THE GENERALS' MINDS A A NATURAL DISASTER IS TURNING INTO A 
HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE OF 
GENUINELY EPIC PROPORTIONS IN 
SIGNIFICANT PART BECAUSE OF WHAT I 
WOULD DESCRIBE AS THE MALIGN 
NEGLECT OF THE REGIME 
THIS WAS THE MOMENT THE CYCLONE HIT 
LAND LAST WEEKEND AMATEUR FOOTAGE 
FROM A TOWN WHICH WAS ALMOST 
COMPLETELY DESTROYED 
TODAY THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT 
SEEMS DETERMINED TO HAND ITS 
RESPONSE ON ITS OWN TERMS WHATEVER 
THE COST IN HUMAN LIVES 
AIRFIELDS ACROSS THIS REGION THAT 
THERE ARE PLANES WAITING ON THE 
TARMAC SUPPLIES READY TO BE LOADED 
AND A LOT OF GOODWILL LOOK AT WHAT 
IS CALLED THE THAI BURMA FRIENDSHIP 
BRIDGE BEHIND ME IN THE LAST TEN 
DAYS ONLY TWO LOWERS LOADED WITH 
TENTS AND PLASTIC SHE MIGHT WILL BE 
ALLOWED TO CROSS 
AS YOU MONITOR THE 
SITUATION FROM THAT VANTAGE POINT 
ARE THERE ANY POSITIVE SIGN THAT 
THINGS MIGHT BE CHANGING IN TERMS 
OF THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT'S STANCE 
THERE HAD BEEN SOME SPECULATION 
THAT PERHAPS THE MILITARY RULERS 
COULD EASE UP A BIT AFTER THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM WAS HELD 
YESTERDAY PERHAPS THIS IS WHAT 
WE'RE SEEING NOW WITH A FEW MORE 
VISAS AND AID FLIGHTS WHAT IS 
PATENTLY CLEAR IS THAT BURMA'S 
GENERALS WANT TO BE SEEN IN CHARGE 
THE STATE TELEVISION HAS HAD 
PICKETS OF THEM DISTRIBUTING THE 
AID AND ALSO WE'RE GETTING SOME 
ACCOUNTS FROM INSIDE BURMA THAT 
SOME OF THE AID BOXES WHICH ARRIVED 
FROM FOREIGN DONORS ARE NOW BEING 
SCRIBBLED WITH SOME GENERALS' NAMES 
ON THE TOP SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE 
CREDIT IN ONE OF THE CRUELLEST 
TRAGEDIES THE THAI AND THE U. S. 
MILITARY ARE ACTUALLY HAVING 
MILITARY EXAMINERS AND THEY ARE 
REHEARSING A MULTI NATIONAL 
RESPONSE IN THE CASE OF A 
HUMANITARIAN DISASTER 
AND THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ALL 
THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY'VE BROUGHT 
IN IN NOW HERE IT HAS BEEN AN 
EXTRAORDINARY DAY OF FOOTBALL FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN NINE YEARS THE 
ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE HAS BEEN 
DECIDED ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE 
SEASON T. WAS MANCHESTER UNITED WHO 
WALKED AWAY WITH THE TITLE AFTER 
VICTORY AT WIGAN THEIR RIVALS 
CHELSEA COULD ONLY MANAGE DRAW 
AGAINST BOLTON HERE'S JAMES MUNRO 
WHO WATCHED ALL THE ACTION 
THE TENSION OF THE FINAL DAY 
REFLECTED IN THE FACES OF 
MANCHESTER UNITED'S PLAYERS IN 
FACT IT WAS CHELSEA AND THEIR 
CAPTAIN JOHN TERRY WHO APPEARED 
UNTROUBLED AS THE TITLE RACE 
REACHED ITS CLIMAX ALL THAT WAS TO 
CHANGE WITHIN MINUTES THOUGH AS 
TERRY COLLIDED WITH HIS OWN 
GOALKEEPER HE WAS LEFT IN AGONY 
WITH AN ELBOW INJURY WHICH MAY RULE 
HIM OUT OF THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE 
FINAL AS WELL UNITED COULD HAVE 
BEEN IN TROUBLE AS WELL WITH A 
POSSIBLE HANDBALL PENALTY FOR RIO 
FERDINAND INSTEAD IT WAS UNITED 
WHO WAS AWARDED SPOT KICK AFTER 
FOUL ON ROONEY RONALDO STEPPED UP 
FOR HIS FORTY FIRST GOAL OF THE SEASON 
AT HALF TIME THE TROPHY WAS OLD 
TRAFFORD BOUND BUT CHELSEA 
WOULDN'T GIVE UP THEY LAID SIEGE 
TO BOLTON'S GOAL AND FINALLY HAD 
THEIR REWARD THROUGH SHEVARDNADZE 
KHEFRPBGO TIME 
EMILE HESKEY WENT CLOSE TO 
PUNCTURING THEIR TITLE DREAMS SO 
COULD SIR ALEX FERGUSON SPUR ON HIS 
SIDE TO TENTH LEAGUE SUCCESS IN 
SIXTEEN SEASONS HE COULD INDEED AND IT 
WAS RYAN GIGGS WHO GUIDED THEM HOME 
THE CELEBRATIONS COULD NOW BEGIN 
SIR ALEX SO WELL VERSED IN WINNING 
STILL SO EXCITED AT THE THRILL OF 
IT CHELSEA HAD CHASED THEM TO THE 
FINAL WHISTLE BUT EVENTUALLY DREW 
DREW WITH BOLTON WHICH LEFT UNITED 
CHAMPIONS BY TWO POINTS 
FIVE THOUSAND UNITED FANS CHEERED INSIDE 
THE STADIUM 
AND MANY MORE JOINED THEIR 
CELEBRATIONS OUTSIDE 
VERY VERY 
PLEASED THE EUPHORIA IN THERE WAS 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
BRILLIANT SO 
GOOD IT'S AMAZING IT'S AMAZING 
THE BEST FEELING EVER 
WE'LL DRINK 
OURSELVES STUPID 
BUT UNITED'S PLAYERS WILL BE 
CHAMPAGNE NOT DRINKING IT AS THEY 
GO IN SEARCH OF A CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE 
TROPHY ONCE AGAIN IT IS CHELSEA 
WHO WILL STAND IN THEIR WAY IN SMO 
U. IN TEN DAYS' TIME 
THERE'LL BE MORE ON THE CRUCIAL 
GAMES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE 
WITH SELINA IN A FEW MOMENTS' TIME 
AN AIDE TO THE PRIME MINISTER HAS 
DISMISSED A CLAIM GORDON BROWN KNEW 
ABOUT LOANS TO THE LABOUR PARTY IN 
THE CASH FOR HONOURS ROW AS 
COMPLETE UNSUBSTANTIATED GARBAGE 
LORD LEVY AT THE CENTRE OF THE 
SCANDAL SAID HE MUST HAVE BEEN 
AWARE OF LOANS BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
ELECTION 
I NEVER MET GORDON ONCE ELECTION DURING THAT TIME BUT IF YOU WERE 
THE LEADER AND GORDON WAS LEADING 
THE CAMPAIGN SURELY YOU WOULD BE 
SITTING DISCUSSING WHAT WAS GOING 
ON I NEVER WENT TO AN N. E. C. MEETING 
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 
GOVERNS OF THE PARTY MY VIEW IS I 
WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SURPRISED AS 
I SAID IN THE BOOK IT WOULD BE 
INCONCEIVABLE THAT HE REALLY DIDN'T 
KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON 
POLICE HUNTING THE KILLER OF 
TEENAGE BOY IN SOUTH LONDON HAVE 
DESCRIBED HIS DEATH AS AN 
UNPROVOKED ATTACK ON A YOUNG MAN A 
TWO MINUTE SILENCE WAS HELD FOR 
JIMMY MIZEN AT THE CHURCH WHERE 
HE'D ONCE BEEN AN ALTAR BOY THIS 
IS JIMMY IN HAPPIER TIMES 
CELEBRATING HIS SISTER'S TWENTY FIRST 
BIRTHDAY LAST YEAR HE TURNED SIXTEEN 
THE DAY BEFORE HE WAS KILLED 
UNIVERSALLY LIKED HE WAS AN ALTAR 
BOY AT HIS LOCAL CHURCH AND AT SIX FEET FOUR INCHES 
DESCRIBED BY HIS MUM AS A GENTLE 
GIANT 
JIMMY WAS THE THE SWEETEST GIANT BOY YOU COULD EVER MEET JUST A 
FINE YOUNG MAN HAPPY ALL THE TIME 
WHISTLED AS HE WALKED DOWN THE ROAD 
WE KNOW HE BOUGHT HIS FIRST LOTTERY 
TICKET NEAR HIS HOME IN LEE AT 
ELEVEN POINT FIVE OH YESTERDAY MORNING HE WAS AT 
THIS BAKERY ON BURNT ASH HILL WHERE 
HE WAS FATALLY WOUNDED HIS ATTACK 
RAN AND WAS LOST IN THE ESTATE 
THIS OFFENCE IS NOT GANG RELATED 
THIS OFFENCE DOES NOT INVOLVE 
KNIVES THIS IS ABOUT A VERY 
VIOLENT EXCESSIVE USE OF VIOLENCE 
UNPROVOKED ATTACK ON A DEPBT 
YOUNG MAN FOR THE SAKE OF THE 
FAMILY AND THIS INVESTIGATION I 
WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD 
WITH INFORMATION 
AND THIS MORNING HIS PARENTS 
ATTENDED MASS AT THEIR LOCAL CHURCH 
EMBRACED BY THEIR COMMUNITY 
I FEEL 
FOR THE PARENTS OF THIS BOY L. 
DON'T KNOW WHY I CAN'T GET THEM OUT 
OF MY MIND BECAUSE WE'VE GOT 
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO JIMMY IS THE 
WORST THING POSSIBLE BUT WE'VE GOT 
SUCH WONDERFUL MEMORIES THEY 
HAVEN'T GOT WONDERFUL MEMORIES FOR 
THEIR SON ALL THEY CAN THINK ABOUT 
IS THE EVIL HE'S DONE MY PRAYERS 
ARE WITH THE FAMILY 
IT'S BEEN A 
CONCERN MUCH MINE DO I TEACH MY 
CHILDREN MY SONS TO BE STREET 
CRED ET CETERA HOLD YOUR HEAD UP 
I THOUGHT NO THERE'S A DECENT WAY 
OF LIVING AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE 
TAUGHT AND I FEEL IN A SENSE

JIMMY'S SCHOOL FRIENDS CAN'T THERE BELIEVE HE'S GONE THEY WANT HIS 
ATTACK TO BE ATTACKER TO BE 
CAUGHT CAUGHT HEAVY FIGHTING HAS BROKEN OUT 
BETWEEN PRO AND ANTI GOVERNMENT 
SUPPORTERS IN LEBANON AS ITS 
POLITICAL POWER STRUGGLE CONTINUES

TAKEOVER OF WEST BEIRUT BY THE 
OPPOSITION HEZBOLLAH MOVEMENT LAST

SHOULD BE SPENT 
PLAYING THE PIANO

CARE FREE WHEN YOU NEED IT BUT 
IT'S NOT 
WHEN WE COME TO NEED HELP WITH 
THINGS LIKE WASHING DRESSING

REALISTIC AND FAIR IN TERMS OF WHAT 
WE ASK THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH 
TAXATION AND WHAT WE ASK OF 
FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS ONE ONE OPTION SERB TO BE RULED OUT IS 
MAKING SOCIAL CARE FREE IT 
HAPPENED IN SCOTLAND BUT PROVED SO 
COSTLY THERE'S BEEN RATIONING AND
