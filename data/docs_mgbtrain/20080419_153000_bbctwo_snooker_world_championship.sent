LONG POTS AND SAFETY YOU CAN HEAR 
ALL THE CLAPPING GOING ON BECAUSE 
PLENTY OF PEOPLE ARE RING HERE 
ENJOYING THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND THE 
CRUCIBLE HE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A 
YEAR SINCE WE WERE LAST HERE I'M 
SURE THE THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS HAVE 
GONE BY IN A BLUR FOR THE DEFENDING 
CHAMPION AS IS THE TRADITION THE 
HOLDER GOT THE EVENT UNDERWAY FIRST 
THING THIS MORNING WHEN HE STEPPED 
OUT THERE WHAT A TOUGH OPENER IT

SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE'S HOPES ARE 
RESTING ON IT NEIL ROBERTSON WHO

NIGEL BOND 
STEVE DAVIS IS THE OLDEST IN THE 
DRAW 
AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT A 
FORMER CHAMPION GRAEME DOTT IS WITH 
US HE HAS BEEN SUFFERING FROM ILL 
HEALTH RECENTLY WE HAVE BEEN 
ENJOYING THE LIVE ACTION AT BETWEEN 
FORMER CHAMPION PETER ABSENT AND 
THE DEBUTANT JAMIE COPE PETER 
EBDON SO FAR THE DEBUTANT HAS 
SHOWN NO NERVES WHATSOEVER 
WE ARE GOING TO GET BACK ALIVE TO 
THE NOW IN THE CRUCIBLE ARENA WITH 
OUR COMMENTATORS 
IT HAS BEEN AN 
INTERESTING START TO THIS FRAME 
PETER EBDON WAS LEFT TO WITHER 
SITUATION WHEN HE HAD A RELATIVELY 
EASY SAFETY SHOT AND TO LET JAMIE 
COPE INTO THIS POSITION HE PLAYED 
A POOR SAFETY SHOT WE WILL SHOW 
YOU THAT SHORTLY LUCKILY FOR PETER 
EBDON EIGHTY ONLY COST HIM FOUR POINTS 
THIS 
WAS THE POOR SAFETY SHOT HE HE WAS PLAYING TO SNOOKER HIM BEHIND 
DEBT YELLOW AND HE DID NOT JUDGE 
THE ANGLE 
IF THE RED GOES IN HE HAS A CHANCE 
OF A BAULK COLOUR BUT HE HASN'T 
QUITE GOT IT SAFE THIS TYPE OF 
SHOT THAT PETER IS FACED WITH AT 
THE START OF THE MATCH HE WASN'T 
EVEN GETTING CLOSE TO THEM BUT HE 
HAS BEEN GROWING A BIT IN 
CONFIDENCE 
VERY GOOD CUEING THERE THAT WAS 
NICE AND SMOOTH HE KEPT HIS HEAD 
STILL 
HE WANTS TO TAKE THE PINK ON BUT 
HE'S A BIT RELUCTANT THE BETTER 
SHOT TO LEAVE AN EASIER RED COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER 
GOOD RECOVERY BUT THIS BLACK IS 
NOW A GIMME 
IF YOU GET THE KISS FULL BALL YOU 
WILL BE NICELY ON THE RED BUT IF 
YOU DO NOT YOU LOSE THE WHITE A 
LITTLE BIT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY 
CAREFUL WITH THIS KIND OF SHOT HE HE HAS GOT TO MAKE SURE HE THE RED 
HE CANNONS INTO DOES NOT COME BACK 
AND CAUSE PROBLEMS 
AND HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SEEN 
THAT A PLAYER CONCENTRATES SO HARD 
ON WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE 
WHITE BALL HE FORGETS TO POT THE 
OBJECT BALL CANNOT AFFORD TO ME 
MISSES LIKE THAT TOO MANY L. 
DIDN'T EXPECT HIM TO MISS THAT ONE 
IPOD WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO STUN 
INTO THE REDS 
IT TOOK TO BE THE 
EASIER SHOT IT LOOKED TO BE THE 
EASIER SHOT 
BUT HE WAS 
CONCENTRATING ON GETTING THE WHITE 
IN BETWEEN THE TWO REDS TOOK HIS 
EYE OFF THE POT 
A GOOD POT BUT BETWIXT AND BETWEEN 
AS FAR AS THE COLOURS ARE CONCERNED 
THE PINK IS THE ONLY BALL HE CAN 
WORK WITH AT THE MOMENT THE BLACK 
IS OUT OF COMMISSION 
THAT WAS A VERY COMMON VERY 
FAVOURABLE KISS HOW HE ENDED UP ON 
THE PINK THERE IS QUITE AMAZING HE 
IS PLAYING FOR THE BLUE AND HE HAS 
PUT A BIT OF CHECK SIDE ON THAT 
ALL OF SUDDEN TWO KISSES PERFECT ON THE PINK 
WILL HAVE TO GET PETER TO TALK US 
THROUGH THAT ONE HE HAS LEFT IT 
VERY DIFFICULT HE CERTAINLY WASN'T 
HOPING TO LEAVE THIS RED TO THE 
LEFT MIDDLE POCKET QUITE A MARGIN 
FOR ERROR TO LEAVE BOTH REDS INTO 
THE RIGHT CORNER IT MAY LOOK 
STRAIGHT FORWARD THIS BUT THIS IS 
A DELICATE ANGLE HE IS LOOKING AT WELL PLAYED 
I THINK HE'S O. K. HE CAN NUDGE A 
COUPLE OF REDS INTO PLAY THOSE 
FIVE REDS ARE ALL BLOCKING EACH 
OTHER SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEVELOP A 
FEW OF THEM 
HE HAS GOT SECOND PRIZE THE RED IS 
AVAILABLE INTO THE MIDDLE TWENTY EIGHT LEAD 
BUT HE NEEDS AT LEAST FIVE MORE 
REDS AND COLOURS TO MAKE THE FRAME 
SAFE FAVOURITE TO WIN THE FRAME AT 
THIS POINT 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT PETER EBDON 
DECELERATE SO OFTEN IN A MATCH HE 
IS UNDERHIT SO MANY BALLS TODAY 
AND NOT STUNNED THAT THE BALLS TO 
HIS LIKING ON A FEW OCCASIONS THAT 
WAS ANOTHER OCCASION THERE THAT 
CAN COME FROM PENSION YOU 
SOMETIMES DECELERATE ON A SHOT 
THAT CAN COME FROM PENSION HE'S 
BATTLING OUT THERE AND THAT IS 
WHAT HAPPENS HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE 
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN 
PETER EBDON HAS HIS OWN INDIVIDUAL 
CUE ACTION HE DOES NOT HAVE A 
PAUSE LIKE LOT OF PLAYERS YOU 
ALWAYS TALK ABOUT FEATHERING THE 
CUE BUT PETER JUST FED VISIT A FEW 
TIMES AND THEN STRAIGHT THROUGH 
DOESN'T STOP IT IS THE WAY HE HAS 
ALWAYS PLAYED IT IS THE STYLE THAT 
TOKEN TO BECOMING THE WORLD 
CHAMPION TOOK HIM TO BECOMING 
THE WORLD CHAMPION THIS IS THE FRAME BALL 
JAMIE COPE KNOWS NOW THAT IT IS FOUR TO TWO 
WHATEVER HAPPENS HE HAS PROVED TO 
US THAT HE'S CAPABLE OF PLAYING 
WELL HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE WE HAVE 
MENTIONED MANY TIMES THAT ROOKIES 
PERRY REALLY PLAY AT THEIR BEST 
BUT HE HAS ACQUITTED AND SELF VERY 
WELL SO FAR ACQUITTED HIMSELF 
THE PINK HAS FAILED TO DISAPPEAR 
PETER EBDON CLOSES THE GAP 
IT IS RED HOT IN THERE AND ALSO IN 
HERE THIS IS RED HOT PUTTING 
CONTEST WE HAVE GOT GOING ON BEHIND 
US SO WE ARC ROYALLY ENTERTAINED 
ALL AFTERNOON LET'S TALK ABOUT 
EVENTS IN THE CRUCIBLE YOU KNOW 
HOW DEDICATED AMMAN PETER EBDON IS 
YOU WILL APPEAR COUPLE OF BOOKS 
AGO WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT HIS 
PREPARATION 
HE LIVES IN DUBAI NOW PREPARATION HE HAS BEEN HERE FOR A FEW WEEKS HE WAS IN THERE FIVE SIX HOURS EVERY 
DAY EATING HIS BANANAS HIS NOTTS 
AND FRUIT GOING OFF SWIMMING 
NOBODY WILL BE MORE PREPARED THAN 
HIM HE LOOKS AFTER HIMSELF FULLY 
FOCUSED ON WHAT HE HAS GOT TO DO 
HE KNEW HE WAS IN A TOUGH MATCH 
AGAINST JAMIE COPE WHAT A YOUR 
OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE CLASH OF 
STYLES THIS MATCH HAS PRESENTED IT IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A 
FASCINATING MATCH IT SEEMS TO BE 
THAT PETER IS PLAYING HIS WAY INTO 
THE MATCH A JAMIE COPE'S PROBLEM 
IS THAT IN A SHORTER FRAME MATCH 
YOU CAN SEE THE FINISHING LINE AND 
IT YOU CAN FOCUS ON THAT IN KEEP 
YOUR CONCENTRATION YOU CANNOT SEE 
YOUR FINISHING LINE SO EASILY IN 
THESE MATCHES SO YOU'RE CUT THE 
TREASURY SHOULD BE DOUBLY HARD 
YOUR CONCENTRATION IF HE LIT HIS 
FOOT OFF THE PEDAL THAT IS WHEN OF 
PETER EBDON CAN COMES BACK 
THIS IS 
AN IMPORTANT JUNCTION IN THE MATCH LET'S GET TO IT 
I HAVE TO AGREE IT IS 
A KEY FRAME JAMIE COPE KNOWS HE 
HAS GOT AN OVERNIGHT LEAD 
THERE WE JUST SIGNED IN THE LAST 
FEW FRAMES THAT PETER EBDON IS 
STARTING TO SHOW BIT OF FORM IT 
IS ALWAYS THE FIRST ROUND AT THE 
CRUCIBLE THAT IS SO TOUGH TO GET 
THROUGH YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU GET 
THROUGH YOU ARE INTO THREE 
SESSIONS AND YOU CAN RELAX 
NO WAY THROUGH FOR JAMIE COPE 
WHICH COULD CAUSE A BIT OF A 
PROBLEM 
WHAT ABOUT THIS FOR A SHOT HE 
COULD BE NICELY ON THE BLACK 
MAYBE IT WASN'T QUITE AS BEEN AS I 
FIRST THOUGHT IT STILL WAS VERY GOOD POT 
ALWAYS HAS THAT RED OVER THE CORNER 
POCKET AS A LITTLE BIT OF INSURANCE 
THAT LEAD AS I MENTIONED COMING TO 
HIS RESCUE NOW THAT RED 
I JUST WONDER WILL WILL HE TAKE 
THE CHANCE TO OPEN THE PINK AND 
RATES 
THAT'S A BIT UNLUCKY PINK AND 
BLACK TIED UP 
HASN'T GOT AN ANGLE ON THE BLUE 
THIS TIME I THINK HE OVER SCREWED IT SLIGHTLY 
HE'S GOT AN ANGLE THIS TIME TO GO 
INTO THE PINK AND REDS 
HE'S O. K. BOTH PINK AND BLACK ARE 
RUN PLAY NOT NICE TO GET ON TO 
EITHER PINK AND BLACK THOUGH ODD 
IN PLAY NOTHING STRAIGHT FORWARD 
AT THE MOMENT A TERRIFIC CHANCE NOW 
HE'S GOT A GOOD TEMPERAMENT THIS 
YOUNG PLAYER THAT'S ANOTHER ONE OF 
HIS GREAT ATTRIBUTES 
HE ALWAYS LOOKS VERY RELAXED AROUND 
THE TABLE AND HE DOESN'T HANG ABOUT 
WHEN HE GETS GOING THAT'S FOR SURE 
I LIKE WATCHING THIS PLAYER I 
REALLY DO 
HE HAD A BREAK OF FORTY ONE IN THE OPENING 
FRAME HE HAD A BREAK OF EIGHTY SIX IN 
FRAME THREE SIXTY FOUR IN FRAME FIVE AND 
NOW THIS 
THERE CERTAINLY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE 
ANY CRUCIBLE NERVES WITH THIS PLAY 
VERY IMPRESSIVE 
HE WON'T BE TOO BOTHERED ABOUT THAT 
THAT WAS A TERRIFIC EFFORT FROM 
JAMIE COPE A BREAK OF SEVENTY FIVE AND IT 
EXTENDS HIS LEAD 
THE BOYS IN THE STUDIO SAID THIS 
WAS QUITE AN IMPORTANT FRAME FOR 
BOTH PLAYERS AND JAMIE COPE HAS 
TAKEN IT HE KNOWS KNOW WHAT IT 
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS HE WILL 
TAKE AN OVERNIGHT LEAD 
I HAVE BEEN 
IMPRESSED CERTAINLY WITH HIS BREAK 
BUILDING AS I HAVE BEEN FOR THE 
LAST TWO YEARS HE WORRIES ME A BIT 
ABOUT HIS SHOT SELECTION BUT THAT 
IS SOMETHING THAT HE WAS SOMETIMES 
REALISE SOON THAT NOW AND AGAIN 
YOU CAN'T PUSH THE BOAT OUT TOO FAR 
BUT HE KNOCKS BALL AFTER BALL IN 
WITH SUCH REGULARITY THIS IS A BIG 
MATCH FOR HIM AND FOR PETER EBDON 
PETER HAS NOT HAD THE BEST OF 
SEASONS HE NOW HAS TO WIN YOU 
WOULD THINK PETER CERTAINLY ONE 
OF THE LAST TWO FRAMES IF NOT BOTH 
THE REFEREE CHAMBERLAIN ASKING 
THEM TO BE QUIET NEXT DOOR IT IS 
THE MAIN THING BOTH FRAMES 
FINISHING VIRTUALLY AT THE SAME 
TIME IT IS AMAZING 
ALL FRAMES ARE IMPORTANT AT THE 
CRUCIBLE THIS ONE I THINK IS 
VERY VERY BIG FOR PETER EBDON 
HE WASN'T EXPECTING THAT RED TO 
REBOUND AND OPEN THE OTHER REDS UP 
HE CAN'T PUSH THE BOAT OUT TOO MUCH 
PETER HE NEEDS TO MAKE SOMETHING 
HAPPEN BUT HE CAN'T TAKE TOO MANY 
RISKS 
HE MIGHT JUST BE O. K. HE WAS TRYING 
TO GET CLOSE TO THE BAULK CUSHION 
IT IS A TOUGH ONE BUT IT IS THE 
ONLY ONE I CAN SEE THE ONE TO THE 
RIGHT 
THAT'S A HANDY LITTLE FLICK OFF THE 
GREEN BUT THERE IS A SAFETY SHOT 
ON FOR JAMIE THE PACK OF REDS 
IT IS ALWAYS TOUGH TO HIT THEM THIN 
ENOUGH THOSE SHOTS HE PLAYED THIS 
NICELY 
PETER MIGHT HAVE TO PLAY A LITTLE 
CONTAINING SHOT HERE 
HE CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE TOO MANY 
RISKS PETER THAT IS WHAT HE HAS 
ELECTED TO DO 
THAT IS A SLIGHT MISJUDGEMENT HE 
WAS PLANNING TO HIT THE OTHER SIDE 
OF THE RED HIS JAMIE COPE GOING TO 
TAKE THIS ALONG THE CUSHION IS 
JAMIE COPE 
IT MIGHT BE A BIT STRAIGHT ON IT 
THERE IS SLIGHT ANGLE HE COULD SCREW BACK 
IF HE SCREWED BACK TO A SIMILAR 
POSITION TO WHAT THE SCREWBALL IS 
NOW HE COULD ALMOST PLAY IT AS A 
SHOT TO NOTHING 
IT IS UNUSUAL FOR 
JAMIE TO TAKE THIS LONG OVER A SHOT 
WITH MENTIONED STRANGE SHOT 
SELECTIONS FROM SOME OF THE YOUNGER 
PLAYERS AND THAT WAS DEFINITELY 
ONE WE HAVE MENTIONED 
I THOUGHT 
HE WAS JUST GETTING DOWN TO PLAY A 
SAFETY SHOT BUT HE TOOK A 
DIFFICULT SHOT ON HIS ONLY PROBLEM 
IS WHERE THE CUE BALL WILL FINISH 
IF PETER EBDON POTS THE BALL WHAT DID CUE BALL WATCH THE CUE BALL 
JAMIE WAS A LITTLE BIT FORTUNATE 
HAVING PLAYED SUCH A POOR SHOT 
THAT LOOKS FAR TOO DIFFICULT TO MAY 
JIMMY TO ME 
HE'S LOOKING AT THE BLACK BUT 
REACHING OVER THE RED 
I THINK I WOULD BE PLAYING THE 
GREEN HERE TO LEAVE THE WHITE 
TIGHT ON THE BAULK CUSHION 
THIS GAME AT TIMES IS ALL ABOUT 
PLAYING PERCENTAGES AND THIS IS NOT 
IN PETER'S FAVOUR 
HE DECIDED AGAINST IT AND QUITE 
RIGHTLY SO 
THAT COULD BE COSTLY IT IS EASY TO 
PLAY SAFE WHEN YOU GET YOUR HAND ON 
THE TABLE HE COULD HAVE LOST THE 
ADVANTAGE WITH THAT PRICE SAFETY 
SHOT THAT POOR SAFETY SHOT OH 
DEAR 
WHAT A BAD CALCULATION THAT WAS 
FROM JAMIE HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO 
GET THE WHITE BEHIND THE GREEN ANDY 
HIT THE RED FAR TOO THICK AND HE 
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE 
YOU NEED LITTLE BIT OF GOOD 
FORTUNE EVERY NOW AND AGAIN EBDON 
IS MORE THAN EXPERIENCED ENOUGH TO 
KNOW HE CAN KNUCKLE DOWN AND MAYBE 
THINGS WILL CHANGE 
THIS IS A TOUGH 
ONE 
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IS A 
TERRIFIC POT HE WAS HOPING TO BE 
ON THE GREEN IT NICELY DEGREE 
NICELY BUT THE BROWN IS AVAILABLE 
AND IF HE HAS A SLIGHT ANGLE HE 
CAN GET TOWARDS THE REDS 
HE WILL BE A BIT AWKWARD HERE JUST 
TO NESTLE ON THE GREEN L. THINK 
JIMMY MIGHT COME OFF THE SIDE 
CUSHION JAMIE ANYTHING ELSE IS 
SO DIFFICULT 
THERE IS NO STRAIGHT FORWARD SAFETY 
SHOT HERE BECAUSE THE WHITE IS 
NEAR THE CUSHION IT IS EASY TO 
UNDERHIT THIS 
JAMIE COPE REFUSED THIS RED A FEW 
MOMENTS AGO BECAUSE IT IS TOO TOUGH 
TO GET ON TO THE BLACK SO I DON'T 
SEE PETER EBDON TAKING IT ON 
I THINK HE HAS GOT A SAFETY SHOT ON 
IF HE WANTS 
HE DIDN'T WANT IN THE POCKET THAT 
IS A BIT UNFORTUNATE 
YOU MAY BE 
THINKING WHY DID HE PLAY THE 
WHITE IT IS SUCH A DIFFICULT 
SAFETY SHOT FROM JAMIE 
WHAT IS HE LOOKING AT I CAN'T SEE 
ANY PLANTS HE WANTS TO TAKE A POT 
ON 
HE WAS LOOKING TO SEE IF ONE OF ON THE REDS COULD PASS INTO THE CORNER 
POCKET HE IS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A 
POT IS JAIME 
HE DOESN'T REFUSE VERY MUCH STAND BY YOUR POCKETS HE HASN'T LEFT A GREAT DEAL TO A 
LITTLE SMILE THERE HE THOUGHT HE 
COULD HAVE SCORED A FEW 
A LONG WAY TO GO IN THIS FRAME WE 
WILL HAVE TO LEAVE IT LET'S DIP IN 
ON EVENTS IN TABLE ONE STEPHEN LEE 
AND JOE SWAIL BOTH HAVE CRISTOBAL 
PEDIGREE AT THE MOMENT IT IS THE 
BELFAST BOY WITH A FOUR TO TWO ADVANTAGE 
CRUCIBLE PEDIGREE 
IT IS THE CARNAGE LEAGUE CUP RUGBY 
LEAGUE ACTION BACK ON B. B. C. SPORT 
WHEN WE ARE DONE IN A FEW MINUTES 
WE WILL BE RETURNING AT SEVEN THIRTY P. M. TO 
SEE WHO WILL BE THE FIRST PLAYER 
THROUGH TO THE SECOND ROUND OF THIS 
YEAR'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP HIGGINS 
LOOKS FAVOURITE 
IN THE MEANTIME WE WILL REVIEW

WAS ONCE A FAVOURITE WE WILL 
LEAVE YOU
