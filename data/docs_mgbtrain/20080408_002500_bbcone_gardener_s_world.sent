WELL HERE WE ARE BACK AT BERRYFIELDS ON A WINTER'S DAY 
WITH MASSES TO DO TO GET THE PLACE READY FOR SPRING 
BUT THE FIRST JOB THAT ALYS AND I WILL BE DOING TODAY 
IS PLANTING UP A BRAND NEW ORCHARD 
HELLO WELCOME TO GARDENERS' WORLD 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE KICK STARTING ONE INTO ACTION AFTER A LONG WINTER 
THAN TO TURN THE COMPOST HEAP 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE TURNED IT THIS YEAR 
AND OF COURSE GOOD COMPOST IS SOMETHING I LOVE 
NOW GARDENERS' WORLD WILL LOOK A BIT DIFFERENT THIS YEAR 
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH YOU'LL SEE AS MUCH OF JOE AND CAROL AS EVER 
THEY WON'T BE HERE AT BERRYFIELDS SO MUCH 
THAT'S BECAUSE JOE HAS TAKEN ON AN ALLOTMENT NEAR HIS HOME IN LONDON 
JOE HAS HARDLY GROWN VEGETABLES BEFORE IN HIS LIFE 
BUT THIS YEAR HE'S TACKLING AN ALLOTMENT TO GROW AS MANY VEG 
FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY AS HE POSSIBLY CAN 
WE SHALL BE FOLLOWING HIS PROGRESS EVERY WEEK AND CAROL WILL BE BASED FROM HER HOME IN DEVON 
DOING WHAT SHE DOES BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE I KNOW RAISE PLANTS 
SHE HAS ALSO ADOPTED A FAMILY AND WILL BE STEERING THEM 
THROUGH THE JOYS OF GERMINATION AND PROPAGATION AND ALL THE WAYS OF RAISING AS MANY PLANTS AS POSSIBLE 
IN AS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY A WAY AS ONE CAN 
I'LL BE HERE AT BERRYFIELDS WITH THE HELP OF THE HEAD GARDENER ALYS 
AND BETWEEN ALL OF US WE WILL BE COVERING EVERY ASPECT OF GARDENING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 
THIS IS OUR SIXTH YEAR AT BERRYFIELDS 
AND BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN BUSY ALL THAT TIME DOING THINGS 
YOU DON'T REALLY NOTICE CHANGES HAPPENING AROUND YOU 
BUT IF I STOP AND THINK WHAT THIS LOOKED LIKE SIX YEARS AGO 
IT WAS RADICALLY DIFFERENT 
THIS WAS JUST A MEADOW MOWN GRASS 
OF COURSE WE PUT THE POND IN 
MIND YOU THIS PARTICULAR POND HAS ONLY BEEN HERE A YEAR OR SO 
THIS IS OUR SECOND ATTEMPT AT IT AND IT HAS WORKED ITSELF OUT 
IT HAS WINTERED WELL IT'S LOOKING GOOD 
THE BOG GARDEN IS READY FOR PLANTING UP WHICH WE'LL DO 
THE NEWTS ARE SORTED OUT THERE IS A NEW NEWT HOME AT THE BACK THERE 
WHERE THEY CAN SNUGGLE UP OVER WINTER 
THEY ARE SAFE AND WE CAN DEVELOP THAT AREA 
THE WILDFLOWER MEADOW HAS BEEN A SUCCESS FROM THE DAY IT BEGAN 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING NOW BUT THAT WILL COME GOOD LATER IN THE YEAR 
AND HAS DONE FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS 
AND ONE OF THE OTHER FACTORS AROUND THE POND WHICH I LIKE VERY MUCH AND WHICH HAS GROWN 
IS THE NECTAR BAR TO ENCOURAGE INSECTS 
WE'RE GOING TO EXPAND THAT TOO 
YOU'RE KEEPING WARM BY WORKING I'M ALREADY STARTING TO FEEL COLD AFTER TURNING THE COMPOST 
THE NECTAR BAR WAS PLANTED UP WITH PLANTS TO ATTRACT INSECTS 
WE'VE LEFT ALL THE TOP GROWTH EVERY WINTER AND NOW YOU ARE CUTTING IT DOWN 
YES WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE MANAGEMENT PLAN 
THE PLAN BEING THAT WE CUT AND LEAVE WHAT YOU CUT ON THE GROUND 
IT LOOKS GOOD THERE I THINK 
YEAH IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT WORKS 
THE IDEA IS WE LEAVE EVERYTHING AS NATURE WOULD MORE INSECTS 
THE MORE INSECTS THE BETTER THE SOIL WORMS WORK THEIR WAY UP 
TO TAKE IT ALL BACK INTO THE SOIL 
BUT IT'S KIND OF JUST FINDING A HAPPY MEDIUM BETWEEN LETTING THINGS COMPLETELY FLOP 
THERE IS A SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT SAYS THAT YOU JUST LEAVE IT 
AND AS YOU SAY IT FLOPS YEAH AND NEW STUFF GROWS THROUGH 
I'M NOT BRAVE ENOUGH I'M WORRIED IT WOULD FLOP ON TOP OF OTHER THINGS AND KIND OF IT'S A BIT TOO MESSY 
I THOUGHT MAYBE IF WE CHOP IT UP IT WILL DECOMPOSE QUICKER 
I WAS DOING IT BY HAND THERE BUT I THINK I MIGHT GO TO THE SHREDDER IN A MINUTE 
THIS IS A FAIRLY RADICAL WAY OF GARDENING 
IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THAT THIS IS NOT WHAT WE'D DO IN THE LONG BORDERS THIS IS A ROUGHER AREA 
DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO ATTRACT INSECTS THAT IS ITS MAIN PURPOSE 
SO WE CAN AFFORD FOR IT TO LOOK A BIT ROUGHER 
BUT IT IS A RADICAL NEW WAY OF GARDENING 
LESS PRIMPING AND PREENING AND MUCH MORE NATURALISTIC IN APPROACH 
IT'S AN EXPERIMENT FOR BOTH OF US 
YEAH AND WE WANT TO TAKE IT RIGHT DOWN THERE 
LET THIS GROW UP HERE AND JUST MOW A PATH THROUGH 
MORE PLANTS MORE INSECTS MORE WILDNESS YES 
WELL I'M GETTING COLD STANDING AROUND I'M GOING TO START PLANTING THE ORCHARD 
NOW THROUGH HERE WHAT YOU SEE IS NOT THE RESULT OF A GIANT MOLE 
BUT PREPARATION FOR OUR ORCHARD 
NOW WE'VE GOT SOME PROBLEMS HERE 
WHICH WE'VE RESOLVED WITH A SPECIAL PLANTING TECHNIQUE 
WE'LL COME TO THAT LATER 
BUT THE IDEA OF AN ORCHARD THE GENERAL IDEA IS SOMETHING THAT I LOVE 
AND I'VE BEEN WANTING TO DO HERE AT BERRYFIELDS EVER SINCE I FIRST CAME 
I THINK ORCHARDS ARE ROMANTIC THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL 
AND ALSO FRUIT FRESH FRUIT SEASONAL FROM THE GARDEN 
IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL GROW AS MUCH OF AS POSSIBLE 
AND THE INSPIRATION FOR OUR LITTLE ORCHARD IS LOCAL 
WE SCOURED THE AREA TO FIND AS MANY LOCAL VARIETIES AS WE CAN 
PARTICULARLY APPLES AND PLUMS AND THAT'S WHAT WE SHALL BE PUTTING IN 
AND WE WENT AND VISITED AN ORCHARD IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE 
WHERE A COUPLE HAVE PLANTED A MUCH BIGGER ORCHARD THAN THIS 
ENTIRELY FROM LOCAL VARIETIES 
THE ORCHARD THAT WE'RE STANDING IN WAS PLANTED BY MY GREAT AUNT IN NINETEEN TWELVE 
IT HAS BEEN IN PRODUCTION FOR MANY YEARS 
AND SHE HAS GREAT REMINISCENCES OF HER CHILDHOOD 
PICKING APPLES 
WE MOVED DOWN HERE IN EIGHTY NINE 
FEELING DISILLUSIONED WITH OUR CITY LIVES AND CAREERS 
WE STARTED DISCOVERING 
THAT GLOUCESTERSHIRE WAS A MECCA OF OLD VARIETIES OF APPLES 
MANY OF THEM ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION 
GOING ROUND THE OLD ORCHARDS WE STARTED FINDING 
THESE FANTASTIC APPLES THAT WE'D NEVER TASTED ANYTHING LIKE THEM BEFORE 
WITHIN GLOUCESTERSHIRE WE'RE BLESSED WITH A FANTASTIC HERITAGE 
OF OLD VARIETIES 
AND THEY MAP THE COUNTY IN TERMS OF THE NAMES OF TOWNS AND VILLAGES 
WHERE THEY ORIGINATED 
LIKE RIPPLES ON A POOL ACCORDING TO HOW GOOD THAT APPLE WAS 
IT SPREAD FURTHER AND FURTHER THE OLD LEGEND IS THEY WON'T THRIVE 
UNLESS THEY CAN SEE MAYHILL 
THE LEGEND IS THERE WAS A FAMILY OF GIANTS LIVING ON TOP OF MAYHILL 
AND A GRANDCHILD BROUGHT A PERRY PEAR TO GRANDPA 
THESE ARE THE PERRYS THAT THEY MAKE THIS LOVELY DRINK OUT OF 
GRANDPA TAKES A BIG BITE OF IT AND PERRY PEARS BY THEIR NATURE 
HAVE A BITTER TANNIC FLAVOUR TO THEM 
AND GRANDPA GOES THAT'S DISGUSTING 
AND SPRAYS THE LANDSCAPE WITH THE PIPS 
HENCE THEY WILL GROW WITHIN SIGHT OF MAYHILL 
THE FACTS AND FIGURES ABOUT TRADITIONAL ORCHARDS MAKE FOR VERY DEPRESSING READING 
UM THERE'S WITHIN GLOUCESTERSHIRE WHICH IS A STRONG APPLE COUNTY 
SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF TRADITIONAL ORCHARDS HAVE BEEN LOST SINCE THE FIFTIES 
THE LAST FIFTY SIXTY YEARS HAS BEEN WHEN THE REAL DEMISE HAS HAPPENED 
NATIONALLY IT'S AROUND SIXTY PER CENT 
SIXTY PER CENT HAVE BEEN LOST 
WE KNOW OF A LOCAL GROWER WHO IS A COMMERCIAL GROWER 
HE GRUBBED UP SEVEN ACRES OF COX 
BECAUSE THE SUPERMARKET BUYER IN HIS OR HER WISDOM 
WANTED COXES WITH FIFTY PER CENT NO THIRTY PER CENT SORRY THIRTY PER CENT RED ON THEM 
AND THEY DON'T ACTUALLY GROW WITH THIRTY PER CENT RED ON THEM IT'S THIS ARBITRARY 
THIS GROWER COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE 
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE FOR HIM TO KEEP THE ORCHARD IN IF HE CAN'T SELL THE CROP 
WE'VE PLANTED A MUSEUM ORCHARD HERE 
THERE WERE KNOWN TO BE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY GLOUCESTERSHIRE VARIETIES 
OF THOSE WE'VE MANAGED TO SOURCE ONE HUNDRED THREE 
THIS IS A TRADITIONAL ORCHARD IN VERY YOUNG FORM 
I HOPE IT WILL LAST AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
AND MAYBE SOMEONE WILL COME ALONG AND REPLANT IN THE GAPS AS TREES FAIL 
SO THIS IS THE START OF THE PROCESS 
I'M PICKING APPLES HERE READY FOR JUICING THEY THEN GO 
BACK TO THE FARM SO WE PACK THEM INTO CRATES 
AND TAKE THEM BACK TO THE FARM 
THE FIRST PROCESS THERE IS THAT THEY ARE ALL WASHED 
AND THEN INTO THE CRUSHER 
WHICH SMASHES THE APPLES TO PIECES BASICALLY 
SO THAT COMES OUT AS THE APPLE PULP 
AND THEN THAT'S TAKEN TO THE PRESS 
THAT RISES UP AND PRESSES THE JUICE 
WHICH IS THEN PUMPED INTO WHAT WE CALL A HEADER TANK 
WHERE THE SEDIMENT CAN SETTLE 
AND THEN IT'S BOTTLED 
ONCE IN THE BOTTLE 
IT'S PUT INTO THE PASTEURIZER 
IT STAYS THERE FOR TWENTY MINUTES 
THEN THE NEXT PROCESS IS TO TAKE THE BOTTLE OUT AND THE LIDS 
ARE SCREWED ON TIGHT 
AND THEN THE BOTTLES ARE RINSED AGAIN AND THEN FINALLY THE BOTTLES ARE LABELLED 
WITH A LABEL PRIOR TO SALE 
SO THEY ARE LABELLED AND THEN ARE READY TO GO OFF TO MARKET 
OR TO GO TO A LOCAL SHOP 
WE KNOW THAT WE WILL BE COMPOST WHEN SOME OF THE TREES 
PARTICULARLY THE PERRY PEAR TREES THAT WE'VE PLANTED WILL BE PRODUCING 
BUT I HOPE THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE AROUND TO ENJOY THEM STILL 
I DO LOVE THE IDEA OF PLANTING SOMETHING FOR THE FUTURE 
THIS ORCHARD HERE AT BERRYFIELDS IS NOT GOING TO GET ME QUICK RETURNS 
THERE MIGHT BE A FEW FRUIT THIS YEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE NEXT YEAR 
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING FOR THE YEARS AHEAD 
NEVERTHELESS IT'S ALL GOT TO START LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE WITH PREPARING THE GROUND 
AND IT IS WORTH TAKING TROUBLE GETTING IT READY 
IT A. H. S. BEEN TROUBLE HERE ACTUALLY REALLY QUITE TRICKY 
YOU CAN SEE I'VE PREPARED THAT BUT I'VE ONLY LOOSENED THE SOIL 
I'M ACTUALLY ADDING SOIL TO IT TO MOUND IT UP SO THAT I'VE GOT A HEAP 
WE'VE KEPT ALL OUR TURVES FROM OVER THE YEARS 
AND THEY'VE ROTTED DOWN WHICH HAS GIVEN US A GOOD SOURCE OF TOPSOIL 
YOU MIGHT THINK THAT EVERYTHING AT BERRYFIELDS IS IDEAL 
AND WE HAVE NO PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH AT ALL BUT THAT JUST ISN'T TRUE 
WE HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEMS AS ANYONE ELSE AND THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE 
BECAUSE THIS AREA IS A PERFECT SITE FOR AN ORCHARD IT'S OPEN 
IT'S FREE SPACED THE TREES HAVE GOT ROOM TO GROW AND IT'S LOVELY AND SUNNY 
BUT IT'S A WET WET BIT OF GROUND 
AND IT DOES FLOOD IT FLOODED HERE A MONTH AGO IN JANUARY 
IF WE HAD DUG A HOLE AND FILLED IT FULL OF COMPOST AS I WAS BROUGHT UP TO PLANT TREES 
IT WOULD HAVE FILLED WITH WATER AND PROBABLY HAVE KILLED THE TREES 
SO I'M GOING TO MOUND PLANT THEM 
SO THEY RISE UP ABOVE THE LEVEL OF POSSIBLE FLOODING 
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT LARGE PLUM BEHIND ME 
THAT'S THE BASELINE THAT'S ABOVE ANY DANGER OF FLOOD 
SO ALL THE TREES HAVE TO BE PLANTED ON THAT LEVEL 
AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO AND HAVE DONE FOR THE OTHERS IS TAKE OUT 
A SQUARE OF TURF SO THE ROOTS CAN GO DOWN IN THE MIDDLE 
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE TOO MUCH SOIL WITH ME 
AND THEN TURN THE TURVES OVER 
AROUND THE OUTSIDE 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF TREES HAVE THEIR FEEDING ROOTS 
BETWEEN SIX AND TEN INCHES BELOW THE GROUND 
AND THAT MEANS THAT THE REALLY IMPORTANT DELICATE ROOTS 
WILL ACTUALLY BE UP ABOVE THE EXISTING SOIL LEVEL 
THAT WILL STOP THE GRASS GROWING THROUGH 
BECAUSE IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT 
THAT THE TREES DON'T HAVE TO COMPETE WITH GRASS OR WEEDS 
AND THAT'S THE BASIS OF THE MOUND 
AND THEN WE BRING IN SOIL THAT WE'VE KEPT OVER THE YEARS 
GOOD TIMING VERY GOOD TIMING 
HERE WE ARE THEY DON'T LOOK MUCH DO THEY NO 
ALL THIS WORK FOR THESE LITTLE SPINDLY THINGS 
BUT THESE ARE ABOUT THE FUTURE 
NOW IT IS WORTH AT THIS POINT POINTING OUT 
THAT THESE TWO BARE TWIGS 
WITH SCRAPS OF ROOT ON THE BOTTOM ARE DIFFERENT IN ALMOST EVERY WAY 
THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT APPLES WHICH ONE IS THAT I CAN'T READ WITHOUT MY GLASSES PITMASTER'S PINEAPPLE 
AND THAT ONE BLENHEIM ORANGE 
I CAN JUST SEE THAT'S ONE HUNDRED SIX AND THAT IS M. TWENTY SIX 
PITMASTER'S PINEAPPLE PINEAPPLE BLENHEIM ORANGE TWO DIFFERENT ROOT STOCKS 
NOW WHEN YOU THINK OF APPLES YOU THINK OF THE FRUIT 
THAT COMES FROM THE TOP PIECE 
BUT ALL APPLES YOU BUY WILL BE GRAFTED ONTO SEPARATE ROOTS 
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THE TOP SECTION CONTROLS THE FRUIT AND THE BLOSSOM 
BUT IT'S THE ROOTS THAT DETERMINE HOW IT GROWS HOW BIG IT GROWS 
IF YOU CAN IN YOUR GARDEN HAVE A BIG LOVELY APPLE TREE YOU SHOULD 
AND THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL HAVE A BIG LOVELY APPLE TREE IS IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT ROOT STOCK 
BUT IF YOU HAVE A SMALL SPACE THERE ARE REALLY SMALL APPLES YOU CAN EVEN GROW THEM IN POTS 
I THINK THE THING TO DO IS GO TO THE WEBSITE 
AND YOU WILL GET DETAILS ON THIS 
WE WON'T TELL YOU NOW BECAUSE IT WILL JUST CONFUSE YOU 
IT CONFUSES ME AND I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS WE ALL FEEL IT'S TREACHEROUS GROUND 
BUT IF YOU GO TO YOUR NURSERYMAN OR YOUR GARDEN CENTRE 
AND SAY I WANT A SMALLISH TREE OR I WANT A GREAT BIG TREE 
THEY WILL GIVE YOU THE RIGHT ROOT STOCK 
FOR HERE WE'VE CHOSEN M. TWENTY SIX AND M. M. ONE OH SIX YES WHY 
WELL THEY'RE GOING TO CREATE THE RIGHT SIZE TREE FOR US NOT HUGE 
BUT IT MEANS WE CAN GET THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT INTO THE SPACE WE'VE GOT 
AND THEN CERTAIN ONES WE'VE PUT ON M. TWENTY SIX 
BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY VIGOROUS TREES AND WE WANTED TO SLIGHTLY DWARF THEM 
THE REALLY NICE THINGS ARE THE APPLES AND THE TREE AND WE'VE GONE LOCAL 
WE HAD A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION DOES IT MATTER DOES ANYBODY NOTICE NOWADAYS 
I REALLY THINK THAT THERE'S A MOVEMENT TO GO BACK TO EATING PROPER BRITISH APPLES 
YOU'VE DONE SOME WORK HAVEN'T YOU I TESTED THIS IDEA 
ALYS WENT TO STOW ON THE WOLD A MONTH OR SO AGO AND SUBJECTED THEM TO THE ALYS TASTE TEST 
AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED 
I'VE BROUGHT ALONG A SELECTION OF APPLES SOME OF THEM ARE LOCAL THAT HAVE COME FROM A GROWER DOWN THE ROAD 
AND THEY'VE GOT LOVELY DELICIOUS NAMES ASHMEAD KERNEL 
BLENHEIM ORANGE ROSEMARY AND RUSSET 
THEY ARE NICE LOOKING APPLES BUT THEY'RE NOT UNIFORM 
AND THEY ARE A BIT SPOTTY BUT THEY SMELL AND TASTE REALLY GOOD 
NOW THE SUPERMARKET APPLES ARE LOVELY APPLES BUT THEY'RE VERY UNIFORM 
AND THEY'VE COME FROM AROUND THE WORLD I'VE GOT APPLES FROM FRANCE 
FROM CANADA FROM THE U. S. A. EVEN FROM CHINA 
THEY ARE APPLES THAT YOU'LL PROBABLY KNOW WELL GOLDEN DELICIOUS BRAEBURN 
PINK LADY VERY COMMON SUPERMARKET APPLES NEXT TO SOME OLD VARIETIES 
TRY A SAMPLE OF EACH AND SEE WHICH ONE YOU PREFER 
DEFINITELY THIS ONE 
THAT'S A BETTER ONE 
YOU CHOSE THE LOCAL VARIETIES 
THESE ONES CAME FROM AROUND THE WORLD AH I'M NOT SURPRISED 
TASTELESS SO THAT MAKES EIGHT TO THE LOCALS VERSUS ONE TO GLOBAL 
M. M. M. THAT'S LOCAL ISN'T IT YES 
MOSTLY I GROW MY OWN SO OH FANTASTIC THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PERSUADE PEOPLE TO DO 
IS GROW LOCAL ONES 
IF YOUR GARDEN CENTRE HAD YOUR LOCAL VARIETY OF APPLE WOULD YOU BUY IT 
OH YES DEFINITELY 
SUPERMARKET 
LOCAL M. M. M. YUM 
DO YOU HAVE A GARDEN WOULD YOU CONSIDER GROWING YOUR OWN APPLES 
WE MIGHT ACTUALLY WE HAVE GOT A GARDEN WE WERE THINKING OF IT 
WE WERE THINKING ABOUT SOME NUT TREES AND SOME APPLE AND PEAR TREES 
BLENHEIM AND ASHMEAD'S KERNEL ARE VERY LOCAL HOW EASY ARE THEY TO GROW VERY VERY EASY TO GROW 
REALLY REALLY SIMPLE AND A GOOD TREE IS NOT THAT EXPENSIVE AT ALL 
YOU CAN BUY A GOOD TREE FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BRILLIANT 
WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT VERY GOOD THANK YOU 
I'D SAY THIS ONE HERE IT WAS SLIGHTLY SWEETER 
THIS ONE WAS QUITE ALMOST TOO CRISP AND CRUNCHY 
AND NOT AS SWEET AS THIS ONE SLIGHTLY BETTER THESE CAME FROM DOWN THE ROAD 
RIGHT AND THESE CAME FROM HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD 
WELL THE MARKET'S COMING TO A CLOSE NOW AND WE'VE GOT A RESULT 
IT SEEMS THAT ALMOST TWICE AS MANY PEOPLE PREFER LOCAL VARIETIES 
AND I HOPE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO BUY LOCAL AND PERHAPS EVEN GROW LOCAL 
IT'S GOOD TO SEE ALYS WHIPPING THE PEOPLE OF STOW ON THE WOLD INTO SHAPE 
AND ALSO GOOD TO SEE THAT PEOPLE CAN INSTINCTIVELY TELL 
AND APPRECIATE WHEN SOMETHING IS LOCAL AS OPPOSED TO IMPORTED AND WE'LL CONTINUE PLANTING 
SOME OF OUR VERY LOCAL ORCHARD HERE AT BERRYFIELDS LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME 
IN TWO WEEKS' TIME CAROL WILL BE CELEBRATING THE ARRIVAL OF SPRING IN THE GARDENS OF DEVON AND CORNWALL 
BUT IT IS HERE AT BERRYFIELDS NOW AND HERE IN SOME WAY 
UNDER THIS AMAZING BLUE SKY AND BRIGHT LIGHT WE'VE GOT SNOWDROPS 
DAFFODILS DAPHNE THE WINTER HONEYSUCKLE AND THE HELLEBORES 
ALL AT THEIR VERY VERY BEST 
WE HAVE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF HELLEBORE LEAF BLOTCH 
WHICH IS A FUNGAL PROBLEM THAT YOU GET ON THE OLDER LEAVES 
PARTICULARLY ON THE ORIENTAL HYBRID HELLEBORES 
THE ANSWER IS JUST TO CUT THEM OFF 
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DO THIS BEFORE THE FLOWERS APPEAR 
MY FEELING IS IT'S SOMETHING YOU STAGGER 
THE KEY THING IS NOT TO PUT THEM ON THE COMPOST HEAP 
PARTLY BECAUSE THEY COMPOST SO VERY SLOWLY THEIR LEATHERY EVERGREEN 
AND IF YOU'VE GOT THE BLOTCHES ON IT THERE'S A RISK OF 
SPREADING THAT FUNGUS WHEN YOU USE THE COMPOST AS A MULCH LATER ON 
SO I WOULD BURN THEM AND THEN PUT THE ASH EITHER ON THE COMPOST HEAP 
OR AROUND MY SOFT FRUIT 
NOW 
YOU CAN SEE HOW OUR CYCLAMENS HAVE SPREAD INCREDIBLY WELL 
THEY'VE SEEDED THEMSELVES 
I LOVE THE WAY YOU HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT LEAF COLOURS AND SHAPES 
YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE SEEDLINGS ARE GOING TO GROW AND END UP LIKE 
WHEN THEY GET MATURE AND IN THERE THERE ARE DOZENS OF THEM 
AND NOW IS A REALLY GOOD TIME TO DIG THEM UP 
YOU CAN SEE I HAVE BEEN DOING A LITTLE ACTUALLY 
I'VE PUT THEM IN A PLUG LIKE THAT THEY'RE TINY LITTLE SEEDLINGS 
BUT EACH ONE WILL GROW INTO A GOOD PLANT 
THEY'RE VERY VERY EASY TO LIFT SO YOU JUST GET IN THERE 
JUST LIFT IT UP YOU CAN SEE LOOK 
YOU GET MASSES OF THEM THERE WE ARE 
A LITTLE SEEDLING 
YOU JUST POP IT IN HERE 
OR YOU CAN GATHER A BATCH AND TAKE THEM BACK TO THE POTTING SHED 
I PREFER TO DO THIS IN SITU 
MASSES AND MASSES OF THEM ALL FOR FREE 
I'LL POP THOSE INTO A COLD FRAME 
AND THEN THEY CAN QUIETLY JUST GET ON WITH THEMSELVES 
NOW ALL OF US LOVE TO GARDEN IN SPRING IT'S EXCITING AND BEAUTIFUL 
BUT I THINK IT TAKES A PARTICULAR TYPE OF GARDENER TO LOVE THEIR GARDEN IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER 
AS MUCH AS IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER WE VISITED JUST SUCH A COUPLE NEAR BRIGHTON NICK AND JANE BAKER 
BUT THEY BOTH HAVE DIFFERENT PASSIONS 
HIS HEART BEATS STRONGEST WHEN HE LOOKS AT HIS SNOWDROPS 
WHEREAS SHE IS TRULY IN LOVE WITH HER HELLEBORES 
IT'S ON AS A COMPETITION 
JUST TO SEE WHETHER JANE OR I WILL BE THE FIRST TO SEE THEM 
COMING THROUGH 
I'VE NOTICED THAT OVER THE YEARS 
I'VE HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT OUR HELLEBORES WHEREAS ORIGINALLY 
THEY WERE MY HELLEBORES 
BUT I DON'T REALLY SAY OUR SNOWDROPS 
IF I'VE SEEN ONE COMING THROUGH I PERHAPS WILL TELL HER STRAIGHT AWAY 
OR PERHAPS I'LL JUST WAIT UNTIL SHE SEES IT 
AND THEN I SAY OH WELL YES BUT THAT'S BEEN OUT FOR SEVERAL DAYS 
AND YOU'VE MISSED IT I AM ALLOWED MORE OR LESS 
TO GET ON IN THE WOODLAND AREA WITH THE SNOWDROPS 
BUT I THINK SHE'S GOT HER EYE ON SOME SPACES FOR HELLEBORES 
I'M INTERESTED IN THEIR LITTLE FACES 
I LIKE TO LOOK IN THE FACE AND SEE THE COLOUR OF THE NECTARIES 
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL ONE PURPLE NECTARIES 
I DO LOVE THE PICKETY OUTLINE 
BUT THESE ARE SO ROBUST THEY 
THESE ARE BUT YOU GET A FROST AND THEY JUST GO FLAT THAT'S TRUE 
BUT THEY COME UP AGAIN 
THESE ARE THE PARTY DRESS HYBRIDS 
THEY'RE SEMI DOUBLES 
THEY'RE CALLED PARTY DRESS HYBRIDS BECAUSE THE HYBRIDISERS LOOKED 
AND THOUGHT THEY WERE LIKE A CHILD'S PARTY DRESS 
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITES IT'S JUST THE COMMON SNOWDROP 
GALANTHUS NIVALIS BUT IT DIFFERS 
IN THAT IT FLOWERS A FEW WEEKS LATER THAN THE STANDARD NIVALIS 
SO THAT MEANS THAT IT WILL FLOWER IN MARCH AND MAYBE IN A COLD WINTER 
IT WILL FLOWER IN APRIL HENCE THE NAME APRIL FOOL 
ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IS HOW THEY LOOK WHEN THEY'RE HANGING DOWN 
INCREASINGLY THE BREEDERS ARE MAKING THE BACKS 
THE TOPS OF THE FLOWERS PRETTIER 
AND SO YOU GET A REALLY GOOD FLOWER ALL ROUND 
IT IS THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT CAN COPE WITH 
THE ICE AND THE SNOW LOW TEMPERATURES 
AND JUST GETS ON WITH IT 
I THINK IT'S THE JOY OF SEEING THE BUDS COMING UP THROUGH THE GROUND 
NO MATTER THE WEATHER 
THESE DO NEED COVERING DON'T THEY SOME OF THEM 
SOMETIMES SOMETIMES FOR THE BLACK SPOT 
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO WITH MY SNOWDROPS 
ALL RIGHT YOU'VE GOT TO AGREE 
I DON'T THINK SO NEVER AGREE 
OH OH 
YOU COULDN'T COULD YOU 
IT'S TOO EARLY TO BE PLANTING POTATOES BUT NOT TOO EARLY TO BE PREPARING FOR PLANTING POTATOES 
BY CHITTING TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO WE DID AN EXPERIMENT AT BERRYFIELDS 
WITH CHITTING FIRST EARLY SECOND EARLY AND MAIN CROP POTATOES 
AND WE FOUND THAT IT DEFINITELY HELPED WITH FIRST EARLIES WHICH IS WHAT I'M DOING TODAY 
IT DIDN'T REALLY HARM BUT NOT MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR SECOND EARLIES 
AND REALLY WASN'T WORTH DOING AT ALL FOR MAIN CROP 
SO IF YOU WANT TO GO FIRST OR SECOND EARLIES THEN DEFINITELY CHIT THEM 
I'M PUTTING OUT A VARIETY CALLED EPICURE 
THIS IS A TRIED AND TESTED FIRST EARLY 
THESE ARE YOUR NEW POTATOES THE TREAT THAT YOU GROW AND DIG UP AT THE BEGINNING OF JULY 
WHICH ARE SWEETER AND CAN BE BOILED SIMPLY WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BUTTER AND MINT 
THAN ANY OTHER POTATO YOU CAN EAT THEY'RE FANTASTIC AND EVERY GARDENER SHOULD GROW THEM 
SO EPICURE WE KNOW WILL DO WELL 
AND YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT THEY'RE DEVELOPING THE SHOOTS 
IF WE LEFT THESE IN A DARK PLACE EVERYBODY'S DONE THIS 
YOU'D GET THESE LONG TRANSLUCENT SPROUTS THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT 
WHAT WE WANT TO DEVELOP ARE A HARD GREEN KNOBBLY PROTRUDENCE 
AND THAT WILL KICKSTART IT INTO ACTION ONCE IT'S IN THE GROUND 
TO DO THAT WE PUT THEM IN A LIGHT FROST FREE PLACE 
A WINDOW SILL IS IDEAL SO THAT'S EPICURE 
IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU CAN'T GROW POTATOES BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE 
YOU CAN GROW THEM IN A CONTAINER THERE'S A NEW VARIETY CALLED MIMI 
I'VE NOT GROWN THIS BEFORE BUT IT WAS DEVELOPED A FEW YEARS AGO 
A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POTATO SPECIFICALLY FOR GROWING IN CONTAINERS 
IT IS TINY AND APPARENTLY REALLY TASTY AND NICE TO EAT 
THIS IS ANOTHER FIRST EARLY SO WE'LL PUT MIMI IN AN EGG BOX 
ANY KIND OF CONTAINER WILL DO SEED TRAY EGG BOX 
ANYTHING WHERE THE LIGHT CAN GET AT IT AND THESE SPROUTS CAN DEVELOP 
IF YOU'RE PUTTING THEM IN AN EGG BOX TRADITIONALLY YOU FIND A SHOOT 
AND THEN PLACE IT SO IT IS POINTING UP BUT DON'T NEED TO WORRY TOO MUCH 
IF THERE DON'T SEEM TO BE ANY SHOOTS COS THEY WILL DEVELOP 
LABEL IT SO I DON'T GET THEM MIXED UP AND PUT THAT ON THE WINDOW SILL 
I'VE GOT ONE HERE CALLED DUNBAR ROVER THIS WAS GIVEN TO ME 
AND RECOMMENDED BECAUSE IT'S RARE AND APPARENTLY REALLY GOOD TO EAT 
I THINK THERE IS A KEY THERE IF YOU'RE GOING TO GROW A POTATO 
GROW ONE WITH MEANING GROW ONE THAT EITHER IS LOCALLY REALLY INTERESTING 
OR ONE THAT YOU REMEMBER FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD OR YOUR GRANDAD GREW 
DON'T GROW ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN BUY IN A SHOP 
MAKE IT SPECIAL BECAUSE THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES TO CHOOSE FROM 
SO DUNBAR ROVER WE'LL GIVE A GO 
WE'VE ONLY GOT TWO AND THAT'S QUITE BIG FOR A SEED POTATO 
THAT IS A SECOND EARLY AND FINALLY I'VE GOT RED DUKE OF YORK MANY OF YOU WILL HAVE GROWN THIS 
IT'S GOT LOVELY RED SKIN IS A GOOD FIRST EARLY 
AND THAT SHOULD BE READY ROUND ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF JULY 
BUT THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TO DO TO LET THEM CHIT LEAVE THEM FOR THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AND THEN HOPEFULLY 
IF THE SOIL WARMS UP O. K. THEY SHOULD BE READY TO PLANT OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF APRIL 
NOW COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME WE'VE GOT LOTS MORE 
INCLUDING A VILLAGE THAT BOUGHT AN ORCHARD FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY 
WE'LL ALSO BE TAKING A LOOK AT THE MAZZARD CHERRY 
OR IS IT JUST A MAZZARD AND NOT A CHERRY AT ALL WE'LL FIND OUT 
AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW THE DETAILS OF OUR TRAILS FOR THIS YEAR AND HOW YOU CAN TAKE PART IN THEM 
AT THIS TIME OF YEAR AT THE BACK END OF WINTER 
INEVITABLY THERE ARE A LOT OF PESTS THAT HAVE OVER WINTERED 
PARTICULARLY IN THE VEGETABLE GARDEN OR ALLOTMENT 
WE WENT TO THE JOHN INNES INSTITUTE IN NORWICH AND MET DOCTOR IAN BEDFORD 
WHO SHOWED US WAYS OF FINDING THOSE PESTS AND DEALING WITH THEM BEFORE SPRING COMES 
CABBAGE WHITEFLY ARE PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON AND EASILY RECOGNISABLE PEST OF BRASSICAS IN THE U. K. 
THEY'RE WHITE MOTH LIKE INSECTS 
AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THEY SIT ON THE UNDERSIDES OF BRASSICA PLANTS 
WHERE THEY WILL BE WAITING FOR WINTER TO COME AND GO 
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE THESE WITHOUT TURNING THE LEAVES OVER 
BUT YOU CAN RECOGNISE WHERE THE INFESTATIONS ARE 
BY LOOKING FOR BLACK SOOTY MOLD WHICH FORMS ON THE LOWER LEAVES 
THIS IS CAUSED BY THE EXCESS SUGARS THAT THE ADULTS AND THE LARVAE 
SQUIRT OUT WHILE THEY'RE FEEDING ON THE PLANT SAP 
THIS LANDS ON THE LOWER LEAVES AND THE SOOTY MOLD BECOMES ESTABLISHED 
CONTROLLING CABBAGE WHITEFLY THIS TIME OF YEAR IS QUITE AN EASY TASK 
JUST SEARCH YOUR PLANTS FIND THE INFESTED LEAVES 
AND SIMPLY SNAP THEM OFF 
DON'T PROVIDE A GREEN BRIDGE FOR THE WHITEFLY TO MOVE TO YOUR NEW PLANTS 
NEXT YEAR BY THROWING THESE ON THE COMPOST HEAP OR ON THE GROUND 
FIND A PLASTIC BAG TO PUT THEM IN SEAL THEM UP WHERE THOSE WHITEFLY WILL EVENTUALLY DIE 
ALSO PICK UP LEAVES WHICH HAVE FALLEN ON THE GROUND ON THEIR OWN 
BECAUSE THESE TOO CAN HARBOUR WHITEFLY THAT CAN MOVE OVER ONTO THE PLANTS NEXT YEAR 
CARROT ROOTFLY ARE THE MAJOR PEST OF CARROTS 
THEY LAY EGGS AROUND THE TOPS OF THE CARROTS GROWING IN THE GROUND 
THESE EGGS HATCH INTO CREAMY WHITE MAGGOTS 
THAT BURROW DOWN AND FEED ON THE CARROT ROOTS 
AT THIS TIME OF YEAR DIG UP ALL YOUR CARROTS 
SORT OUT THE GOOD FROM THE BAD AND DISPOSE OF THE BAD ONES 
WITH THE DAMAGE FROM THE CARROT ROOTFLY 
AND DIG OVER THE WHOLE AREA TO EXPOSE ANY OF THE LARVAE AND PUPAE WHICH MAY BE OVER WINTERING IN THE SOIL 
TO ALLOW THE BIRDS TO PICK THEM OFF OR THE FROST TO KILL THEM OFF 
ANYONE WHO GROWS GOOSEBERRIES RED CURRANTS WHITE CURRANTS WILL KNOW 
THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO OF HAVING AN INFESTATION OF GOOSEBERRY SAWFLY 
A LARGE INFESTATION CAN ACTUALLY DEFOLIATE A BUSH VERY QUICKLY 
THREE GENERATIONS CAN OCCUR IN A YEAR 
BUT THE GENERATION WE'RE INTERESTED IN HERE IS THE FINAL GENERATION 
IT IS WHERE THE LARVAE HAVE PUPATED FALLEN TO THE FLOOR 
BURROWED INTO THE GROUND PRODUCED A LITTLE COCOON AND PUPATED 
AND ARE SITTING OUT THE WINTER 
YOU NEED TO TAKE A FORK DIG AROUND THE OUTSIDE EXPOSE THE PUPAE 
TO THE INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS WHO HAVE MUCH BETTER EYESIGHT THAN WE HAVE AT FINDING THESE PUPAE 
ONE WAY TO ENCOURAGE THE INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS INTO THE GARDEN 
SO THERE IS MORE CHANCE OF THEM FINDING THESE PUPAE 
IS ACTUALLY TO BUY SOME OF THESE MEALWORMS 
WHICH CAN BE BOUGHT EITHER AS DEAD DRIED ONES OR AS LIVING ONES 
JUST SCATTER THEM AROUND THE GARDEN TO ENCOURAGE BIRDS LIKE ROBINS 
TO COME ALONG AND FIND THE EXPOSED PUPAE 
AND THEREFORE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE OPPORTUNITY 
OF THESE THINGS COMING BACK ONTO THE GOOSEBERRY BUSHES IN THE SPRING 
I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT YOU NEED TO BRING THE BIRDS INTO THE GARDEN 
BY FEEDING THEM JUST GIVE THEM COVER WHENEVER I'M IN THE GARDEN 
I'M SURROUNDED BY BIRDS WAITING FOR A JUICY TID BIT 
GIVE THEM COVER AND THEY'LL COME 
BUT TALKING ABOUT SAWFLY MAKES ME WANT TO PLANT SOFT FRUIT 
NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO PLANT GOOSEBERRIES RED CURRANTS 
BLACK CURRANTS WHITE CURRANTS 
AND I'VE GOT HERE SOME CORDON GOOSEBERRIES 
I LOVE GOOSEBERRIES BUT I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL 
YOU NEED A LOT OF SPACE TO GROW THEM IN BUT IF YOU GROW THEM AS CORDONS 
YOU CAN GROW THEM IN A FOOT WIDE STRIP AGAINST A FENCE 
THEY'RE PERFECT A CORDON IS SIMPLY A BUSH THAT HAS BEEN TRAINED 
ONTO JUST ONE STEM ALL THE SIDESHOOTS ARE CUT OFF 
KEEP IT PRUNED SO IT CAN GROW AS HIGH AS IT LIKES BUT NEVER WIDER 
IT'S PERFECT FOR GROWING IN A SMALL SPACE I'M GOING TO PUT A LINE 
OF GOOSEBERRIES ALONG THE BACK GOOSEBERRIES ARE TOUCH PLANTS 
YOU JUST CHUCK 'EM IN THE GROUND IN FACT 
I REMEMBER ONE OLD BOY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS COMPLAINING I WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH GOOSEBERRIES 
THAT THEY WERE GETTING MOLD AND SAWFLY HE SAID 
THE SECRET IS GIVE THEM A HARD TIME TREAT 'EM ROUCH BOY 
AND IT WORKS THERE'S NO EXTRA MANURE IN HERE 
JUST POP THEM IN THE GROUND AND IF YOU'VE GOT A FIRE PARTICULARLY 
A WOOD FIRE PUT THE ASHES ON THEM IN APRIL OR A POTASH FEED PERHAPS 
IN SPRING AND THAT'S ALL THEY NEED 
THE SPACING FOR CORDONS IS ABOUT A FOOT APART SO REALLY QUITE CLOSE 
JUST DIG IT OUT 
YOU'LL NOTICE I'VE GOT THEM IN A BUCKET OF WATER 
REALLY IMPORTANT WITH ALL BERRY PLANTS NEVER TO LET THEM DRY OUT 
NOT EVEN FOR HALF AN MINUTE 
YOU CAN SEE THAT'S A REALLY GOOD ROOT SYSTEM ON THIS PLANT 
IT'S ONLY A SMALL SHOOT COMING OFF IT BUT POWERFUL ROOTS 
AND IN THE END THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE BUYING 
GOOD ROOTS AND YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE A GOOD PLANT 
THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT GOOSEBERRIES IS YOU CAN EAT THEM LIKE GRAPES 
YOU CAN MAKE JAM PIES STEW THEM THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS 
AND ALSO THEY WILL FRUIT AT DIFFERENT TIMES 
SO THEY'RE VERY VERY VERSATILE AND A LOVELY FRUIT TO GROW NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE DO 
I WILL MULCH THESE TO KEEP THE WEEDS DOWN BUT NOT TO FEED THEM 
NOW THE BAMBOO CANE HAS TO STAY ON IN FACT THESE ARE TOO SHORT 
I WANT A LONGER CANE WHICH I WILL ATTACH 
ALSO THEY WILL NEED SOME KIND OF PROP AS THEY GROW 
JUST SOME WIRE TO STOP THEM FLAPPING AROUND IN THE WIND ALL THAT CAN BE DONE LATER 
WHAT MATTERS AT THIS TIME OF YEAR IS TO GET THEM IN THE GROUND 
AND THEN ONCE YOU'VE PLANTED THEM JUST GIVE THEM A LITTLE PRUNE 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT GOOSEBERRIES IS THEY'RE TOUGH IF YOU CAN GROW A BRAMBLE YOU CAN GROW A GOOSEBERRY 
ANYWAY WE'LL BE REVISITING THESE REGULARLY THROUGHOUT THE SEASON 
I'VE JUST PLANTED A PLUM AND I'M GOING TO PUT ANOTHER ONE IN HERE 
THIS IS YELLOW EGG WHICH COMES FROM PERSHORE 
WHICH IS NOT SO FAR FROM HERE COS THE THEME OF THIS ORCHARD IS LOCAL 
LOCAL FRUIT AND THIS IS A GREAT PLUM GROWING AREA 
NOW WHEN YOU'RE PLANTING FRUIT OF ANY KIND 
I NEED TO DIG THAT HOLE OUT A BIT MORE YOU WILL NEED A POLLENATOR 
SOME PLUMS ARE SELF FERTILE BUT IT'S MUCH SAFER 
IF YOU WANT TO GUARANTEE FRUIT TO GET TWO OR HAVE ON NEARBY 
IF YOU LIVE IN A ROW OF GARDENS CHANCES ARE THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ONE DOWN THE ROAD 
THE RULE OF THUMB UP TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AND YOU'RE O. K. 
IF YOU HAVE GOT SPACE MUCH BETTER TO PLANT TWO OF ANY KIND OF FRUIT 
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT MAKES SENSE YOU HAVE YOUR BEE 
THAT ARRIVES AT THE BLOSSOM ON YOUR PLUM OR APPLE OR PEAR 
AND THEN IT GOES OFF TO ANOTHER TREE AND IF THERE'S NO FLOWER THERE IT CAN'T POSSIBLY CROSS POLLINATE IT 
SO YOU MUST HAVE TWO TREES THAT ARE IN FLOWER AT THE SAME TIME IT'S COMMON SENSE 
PLUMS WILL CROSS POLLINATE EACH OTHER WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS 
AND MOST PEARS ARE COMPATIBLE 
BUT APPLES CAN BE A BIT MORE CHOOSEY 
BECAUSE THEY'RE FLOWERING TIME COVERS FROM OOH 
EARLY APRIL SOME OF THEM CERTAINLY MID APRIL TO MID MAY 
AND AS THEY ONLY STAY IN FLOWER FOR ABOUT TEN DAYS IT'S VERY EASY FOR 
ONE TREE TO HAVE FINISHED FLOWERING BEFORE ANOTHER TREE STARTS SO THEY NEED TO BE IN THE SAME GROUP 
ASK THE SUPPLIER AT THE GARDEN CENTRE CAN I HAVE TWO APPLES 
OF THE SAME OR ADJACENT GROUPS THAT'S GUARANTEED TO SOLVE IT 
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK 
AT THESE LOCAL VARIETIES OF FRUIT THAT WE'VE PLANTED IN OUR ORCHARD 
COME ALONG TO GARDENERS' WORD LIVE AT THE N. E. C. IN JUNE 
AND THERE THEY WILL HAVE ON DISPLAY LOCAL VARIETIES 
LIKE THE PLUM YELLOW EGG 
OR THE APPLE ASHMEAD'S COLONEL IN ALL THEIR GLORY 
A BARE ROOT TREE THIS HAS GOT QUITE VIGOROUS ROOTS 
BUT YOU CAN SEE 
NOT BURYING IT IN A HOLE 
THEN MOUND THE SOIL UP ROUND IT 
THAT'LL BE FINE 
AT THE END OF FEBRUARY 
RIGHT AT THE END OF THE BARE ROOT PLANTING SEASON 
I THINK BARE ROOT TREES ARE BETTER ALL ROUND 
THEY'RE BETTER VALUE AND YOU'VE GOT A WIDER RANGE OF CHOICE 
BUT IT'S MUCH EASIER TO GET THEM IN A CONTAINER 
PARTICULARLY ONCE YOU HIT SPRING I'VE GOT ONE HERE IN A CONTAINER 
THIS IS A PLUM CALLED WARWICKSHIRE DROOP 
COULDN'T FAIL TO WANT TO PLANT A TREE WITH A GOOD NAME LIKE THAT 
IN A POT NO PROBLEM AT ALL JUST GIVE IT A GOOD SOAK 
TAKE IT OUT AND PLANT IT TO THE LEVEL THAT IT WAS IN THE POT 
MOUND PLANTED YOU CAN ADJUST THAT LEVEL WITH THE MOUND 
IF YOU'VE GOT GOOD DRAINAGE AND YOU PLANT IT IN THE SOIL 
YOU CAN DO SO ACCORDINGLY 
DO LEAVE A NICE BIG AREA AROUND IT TO KEEP IT WEED FREE 
NOW WE'RE CREATING SOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO BERRYFIELDS 
IT'S PRIVATE WE'RE PROUD OF IT IT'S FOR THE FUTURE AND 
IT'S ATTACHED TO THIS HOUSE 
BUT WE WENT TO VISIT AN ORCHARD IN KEMERTON NOT FAR FROM HERE 
THAT BELONGS TO THE COMMUNITY 
THE VILLAGE HAD CLUBBED TOGETHER 
TO BUY AN ORCHARD THAT THE COMMUNITY COULD SHARE 
AND ENJOY FOR THE FUTURE 
LITTLE ORCHARDS ARE A NATURAL HERITAGE 
THAT WE LOSE AT OUR PERIL 
THEY'RE A RELIC OF THE PAST BUT THEY HAVE GOT A FUTURE 
THERE'S A SENSE OF COMMUNITY IN KEEPING THIS FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS 
AND TO ENJOY NOW 
THIS LITTLE ORCHARD IS AN OLD ORCHARD 
IT'S BEEN HERE A LONG TIME 
THEY FORM A SETTING FOR OLD TREES 
THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE 
THE ORCHARD WAS OWNED BY A FAMILY WHO LIVED IN THE COTTAGES 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ORCHARD 
THEY HAD LIVED THERE FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
THE LAST MEMBER OF THE FAMILY BETTY DAFFEN DIED IN TWO THOUSAND 
AND SHE SAID IN HER WILL THAT IF THE VILLAGE WOULD LIKE TO BUY THE ORCHARD 
FOR FIVE THOUSAND WE COULD HAVE IT 
TO KEEP IT AS AN ORCHARD 
WE MANAGED TO RAISE NINE THOUSAND SO IN ESSENCE 
THE COMMUNITY HAVE SAVED THIS LITTLE ORCHARD 
KEMERTON ORCHARD WORKERS IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE 
ALL OF THEM FROM THE VILLAGE 
WHO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ORCHARD IS KEPT UP TO STANDARD 
IT WAS IN POOR SHAPE WHEN WE TOOK IT ON 
WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A TRAINING PROGRAMME 
TO LEARN HOW TO MANAGE THESE TREES 
THIS YEAR PARTICULARLY THE RABBITS HAVE BEEN VERY BAD 
AND THEY'VE STARTED TO EAT THE BARK OFF THE TREES 
WE HAVE PUT WIRE NETTING AROUND THE BASE OF THE TREES 
TO STOP THEM BUT WE ALSO DISCOVERED 
THEY WERE TAKING THE BARK OFF THE BITS OF WOOD 
THAT WE HAD CUT 
ACTUALLY WE DECIDED TO LEAVE IT SO THAT 
THEY WOULD TAKE THE BARK OFF THOSE 
RATHER THAN OFF THE TREES 
SOME ORCHARDS LIKE THIS ONE WHICH WE TREAT AS A NATURE RESERVE 
IS BUZZING WITH WILDLIFE 
YOU CAN HEAR SOMETHING IN THE BACKGROUND AS WE SPEAK PROBABLY 
THERE ARE A WHOLE RANGE OF REASONS WHY THEY ARE IMPORTANT 
THESE TREES ARE HOST TO LICHENS 
WHICH ARE IMPORTANT PLANTS 
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF MONITORING 
POLLUTION IN AN AREA 
THIS TREE IS A REALLY OLD PERRY PEAR 
IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THE BARK 
YOU'LL SEE IT'S FISSURED AND CRACKED 
FROM A WILDLIFE POINT OF VIEW IT'S A NATURE RESERVE ON ITS OWN 
IT'S HOST PROBABLY TO A RANGE OF INSECTS 
IT'S A MAGNIFICENT THING TO HAVE IN THE LANDSCAPE 
THE PROJECT HAS BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER 
AND IT HAS BECOME PART OF VILLAGE LIFE 
ESSENTIALLY IT BELONGS TO THE WHOLE COMMUNITY 
AS A FAMILY IT'S BEEN A LOVELY PLACE TO COME AND PLAY TO PINIC 
TO GET INVOLVED WITH MEETING PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE 
THE CHILDREN HAVE LOVED BEING INVOLVED WITH THIS AND 
HAVE LIKED THE IDEA OF GETTING STUCK IN IF THEY CAN PASS THAT ON AND 
REMEMBER BEING HERE AS CHILDREN WHEN THEY COME BACK AS ADULTS 
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO VALUE 
I THINK BETTY WOULD BE PROUD OF HER ORCHARD NOW 
SHE WOULD LOVE IT JUST TO SEE THAT THE ORCHARD HAD IMPROVED 
AND THAT IT WAS BEING MAINTAINED 
SHE FELT THAT SHE WASN'T ABLE TO DO THAT IN HER LATER YEARS 
SHE WOULD ENJOY THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WERE ENJOYING IT 
THEY ALL KNOW THAT IT'S HERE AND IT'S FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN 
AND JUST SIT QUIETLY AND CONTEMPLATE 
AND ENJOY THE SERENITY THAT THIS LITTLE ORCHARD DOES GIVE 
O. K. 
ALL YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THAT YES 
ALYS AND I ARE NOW STAKING THE TREES 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO DO THAT 
I'M PUTTING THE STAKES ON THE WIND SIDE 
THE PREVAILING WIND WHICH COMES FROM OVER THERE 
AND GIVE THEM A GOOD BANG 
THESE ARE RECYCLED ROOFING BATTENS 
BUT ANY STRONG STAKE WILL DO THAT WILL LAST FOR THREE TO FIVE YEARS 
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT IT 
BECAUSE THE ROOT STOCK IS QUITE VULNERABLE 
TOO MUCH MOVEMENT MIGHT DAMAGE IT 
ALSO WE WANT A STRAIGHT STEM FOR OUR TREE 
THIS WILL HELP PROVIDE THAT 
ALYS WILL COME AND TIE THEM UP 
THAT WAY IT'LL BE SUPPORTED 
AND YET HAVE SOME MOVEMENT TO GET ITS OWN TENSILE STRENGTH 
FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS 
ALSO IF YOU LIVE IN AN AREA WHICH HAS RABBITS 
THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO PROTECT THEM BECAUSE RABBITS 
LOVE A YOUNG JUICY FRUIT TREE 
WE'RE NOT TOO AFFECTED WITH RABBITS HERE ARE WE NONE REALLY 
A DOG A DOG WILL SEE THEM OFF 
HOWEVER GUARDS YOU MUST GET 
YOU CAN BUY GUARDS OF VARIOUS KINDS 
THIS IS ACTUALLY A DEER GUARD 
SO IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE DEER AROUND 
THAT'S GOOD FOR LOOKING AT BUT NOT GOOD FOR TREES 
YOU'LL NEED A GOOD GUARD 
WE'LL WORK ROUND THESE AND GO ROUND AND GIVE THEM A VERY LIGHT PRUNE 
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT MATURE APPLE TREES THEY NEED REGULAR PRUNING 
PRUNING IS SOMETHING THAT GIVES LOTS OF PEOPLE THE HEEBIE JEEBIES 
IT REALLY WORRIES THEM 
IT SHOULDN'T DO BUT THERE ARE A FEW TIPS YOU CAN GET 
THAT WILL GIVE YOU MORE CONFIDENCE 
THE BEST PLACE TO GO TO GET THOSE TIPS IS TO THE TOP 
WE'VE BEEN TO THE R. H. S. WISLEY 
TO FIND OUT HOW THEY PRUNE THEIR APPLE TREES 
I'M ALLI VALSSECHI SENIOR SUPERVISOR IN THE FRUIT DEPARTMENT 
AT WISLEY GARDENS 
THE SKILL I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IS PRUNING OF ESTABLISHED APPLE TREES 
THE IDEAL TIME TO PRUNE APPLE TREES 
IS THROUGHOUT THE WINTER MONTHS 
FROM LEAF FALL ONWARDS 
THE TOOLS YOU USUALLY USE ARE 
A SAW 
AND A GOOD PAIR OF SECATEURS 
YOU WILL NEED A GOOD SOLID LADDER FOR THE TALLER BRANCHES 
THE REASON WHY WE PRUNE IS TO KEEP THE TREES IN SHAPE 
WE WANT TO HAVE AN OPEN CENTRE GOBLET SHAPE 
WE MANAGE THE TREE WITH THE PRUNING WE KEEP IT HEALTHY 
AS WELL AS KEEPING THE TREE GROWING 
WE CAN START BY REMOVING THE THREE D.'S 
DEAD DISEASED AND DAMAGED BRANCHES CUTTING THEM BACK TO HEALTHY WOOD 
IMPORTANT IS REMOVING BRANCHES AFFECTED BY CANKER 
IN OVERCROWDED TREES AND OLD TREES THEY OFTEN APPEAR 
CANKER IS A DISEASE 
IF YOU DON'T REMOVE IT IT WILL EVENTUALLY SPREAD 
THROUGHOUT THE TREES 
ALSO REMOVE MUMMIFIED FRUIT 
THEY CAN SCAR THE TISSUE INCREASING THE RISK OF INFECTION 
THEN WE LOOK AT REMOVING ANY OVERCROWDED AREAS 
OVERLAPPING CROSSING BRANCHES 
WE ALSO HAVE TO REMOVE ANY BRANCHES THAT ARE GROWING INWARDS 
WE'RE THINKING OF HAVING A GOBLET SHAPE 
SO THE CENTRE HAS TO BE OPEN 
THEN WE LOOK AT RESIZING THE TREES SO WE REMOVE BRANCHES THAT 
MIGHT BE TOO HIGH 
IF YOU HAVE AN OLD APPLE TREE 
DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF TACKLING IT ALL AT ONCE 
THINK OF IT AS A THREE YEAR PROJECT 
SO ON THE FIRST YEAR REMOVE A THIRD OF THE BRANCHES 
THAT YOU PLAN TO REMOVE AND SO ON IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR 
OVER PRUNING CAN OFTEN LEAD TO TOO MUCH VIGOROUS GROWTH 
IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR 
WATER SHOOTS ARE GROWTH FROM LAST YEAR 
OUT OF THE MAIN STEM 
THEY NEED TO BE REMOVED 
IN PARTICULAR THE VERY BIG ONES 
WHEN THEY GROW INTO CLUSTERS SOME OF THE CLUSTERS SHOULD BE REMOVED 
NOT ALL OF THEM OTHERWISE YOU WILL ENCOURAGE MORE VIGOUR 
MOST OF THE TREES WITH SMALL BERRIES 
AS THIS ONE THEY HAVE CLUSTERS OF SPURS AND THEY BECOME CONGESTED 
IN THE FALL IT IS GOOD PRACTICE TO THIN THOSE CLUSTERS OUT 
IN ORDER TO REMOVE SOME POTENTIAL FRUIT 
YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT EACH ONE OF THESE BUDS 
WILL GIVE AT LEAST FIVE FRUIT 
WHICH WILL NEED TO BE THINNED DOWN 
TO A COUPLE PER SPUR 
THINNING AT THIS STAGE WILL HELP US LATER WITH THE THINNING OF THE CROP 
WE LIKE TO KEEP THE CROP BALANCED AND REGULATED YEAR AFTER YEAR 
THE PRUNING IS NOW FINISHED 
YOU WILL NEED TO REPEAT THE PRUNING YEAR AFTER YEAR IN THE WINTER 
WHAT IS LEFT NOW IS JUST TO CLEAR UP THE RUBBISH 
IN PRACTICE I DON'T THINK ANY OF THESE TREES NEED PRUNING AT ALL 
THAT'S BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO GROW WITH A TRUNK AND A STEM 
TO ENCOURAGE VIGOROUS GROWTH 
THAT MEANS HAVING FOLIAGE AND THAT WILL GET THEM OFF TO A GOOD START 
HOWEVER IF I WANTED GOBLETS THEN IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA 
AFTER PLANTING 
TO TAKE OFF THE TOP FOOT OR SO 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT A SLANTING CUT 
BY TAKING OUT THE LEADER 
YOU ENCOURAGE THE LATERALS TO GROW MORE 
THAT GIVES YOU THE FRAMEWORK FOR YOUR FUTURE TREE 
WE'LL LEAVE THAT AND LET IT GROW FOR THE FIRST YEAR OR SO 
OF COURSE WE'LL BE COMING BACK TO THIS REGULARLY 
OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS 
GIVE IT A GOOD WATER AND THEN WE'LL MULCH 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT TIME OF YEAR IT IS IF IT'S BEEN WET OR NOT 
ALWAYS WATER IN ANYTHING YOU PLANT PARTICULARLY BARE ROOT PLANTS 
THEY CAN DRY OUT UNDER THE SOIL JUST AS EASILY AS IN THE AIR 
RIGHT 
ARE YOU O. K. TO FINISH OFF NOW ALL RIGHT 
AS ALYS FINISHES OFF PLANTING THE ORCHARD 
AND WE COME NEAR TO THE END OF THE PROGRAMME 
AND THE END OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DAY HERE AT BERRYFIELDS 
I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE TRIAL WE'LL BE DOING THIS YEAR 
WE'RE GONNA TRIAL COSMOS 
COSMOS BIPINNATUS 
WHICH IS A HALF HARDY ANNUAL 
LOTS OF US GROW IT 
ANYBODY WHO'S GROWN IT REGULARLY KNOWS THAT THE SECRET 
OF KEEPING COSMOS FLOWERING WELL INTO AUTUMN IS TO DEADHEAD IT 
THAT'S WHAT THE TRIAL IS ABOUT 
WE'VE GOT FIVE DIFFERENT VARIETIES WE'RE GIVING AWAY ONE THOUSAND PACKETS OF 
EACH OF THEM AND WE'D LIKE YOU TO GROW THEM AT HOME 
AND THEN KEEP DEADHEADING THEM 
LET'S FIND OUT 
WHICH VARIETY CAN LAST LONGEST 
WHICH RESPONDS BEST TO THE DEADHEADING REGIME 
IF YOU WANT DETAILS ABOUT HOW YOU CAN GET ONE OF THESE FREE PACKETS 
GO TO 
IF YOU DON'T GET A FREE PACKET 
YOU CAN STILL TAKE PART IN THE TRIAL BY BUYING THEM 
THEY'RE ON SALE IN GARDEN CENTRES EVERYWHERE 
ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE PACKETS DON'T SOW THEM YET 
BECAUSE WE'LL ALL BE DOING IT AFTER EASTER IN APRIL 
BEFORE WE GO YOU MAY REMEMBER EARLIER I MENTIONED 
THE MAZZARD CHERRY OR WHETHER A MAZZARD IS A CHERRY AT ALL 
WE'LL HERE'S THE ANSWER 
LOOKING AT THE TREE 
IT PURPORTS TO 
LOOK QUITE LIKE A CHERRY 
BUT THE ACTUAL FRUIT IS QUITE DIFFERENT 
WE HAD A DEAR OLD GENTLEMAN 
WITH A HIGH PITCHED VOICE AND IF SOMEBODY SAID 
ABOUT THE CHERRY AND THE MAZZARD 
THEY'D REFER TO IT AS THE MAZZARD CHERRY 
NOTHING OF THE SORT 
A MAZZARD'S A MAZZARD AND A CHERRY'S A CHERRY THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE 
I KNOW A GENTLEMAN THAT USED TO HAVE A WHITE HEART CHERRY 
ALONGSIDE AN OLD MAZZARD 
THE BIRDS WOULD SWIPE THE MAZZARDS 
AND LEAVE THE WHITE HEART CHERRY 
WE CAN LEAVE IT TO THE BIRDS TO KNOW WHAT'S BEST 
THE SWEETNESS IS SOMETHING SPECIAL 
MY FIRST RECOLLECTION OF THE MAZZARD IS AS A YOUNG BOY 
I WAS GOING AROUND SHOOING OFF THE BIRDS 
GOING DOWN TO MAZZARD GREEN 
AND SCROUNGING A FEW MAZZARDS 
THE MAZZARD BLEEDS TERRIBLY 
AND THE STAIN WOULD COME ON YOUR HANDS AND YOUR MOUTH 
THERE WAS NO GOOD SAYING I HADN'T HAD THEM 
SPEAKING TO THE FARMER BECAUSE THERE WAS THE STAIN ON YOUR MOUTH 
AND ON YOUR FINGERS AND THERE WAS NO GETTING OUT OF IT 
THE REASON FOR DYING OUT IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
THERE WERE SUBSIDIES FOR GETTING RID OF OLD ORCHARDS 
AND THERE WAS NO REPLANTING DONE 
IN THE SEVENTIES WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MAZZARD 
AND I HAPPEN TO SEE A NURSERYMAN A MR. FRED HARRIS 
AND PERSUADED HIM TO TAKE SOME STOCK 
FRED TOOK FORTY TAKES OF ROOT STOCK 
OF THE FORTY ONLY SIX GREW 
THESE TWO TREES ARE TWO OF THE SIX THAT FRED MANAGED TO DEVELOP 
WE AT LANDKEY FELT THAT WE SHOULD SAFEGUARD THEM FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS 
AND WE'RE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING IT AND VERY LUCKY 
WHEN WE PLANTED THE TREES IN THE MILLENNIUM GREEN 
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY THE PARISH ITSELF HELPED IN EVERY WAY 
WE PLANTED SIXTY MAZZARDS THE FIVE VARIETIES 
ARE THE FIVE THAT WE'VE MANAGED TO RESTORE 
I THINK WE CAN SAFELY SAY THAT THE MAZZARD GREEN AT LANDKEY 
IS THE FIRST ONE TO BE PLANTED IN OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
I THINK IT'S A CREDIT TO THE PARISH 
AND HOPEFULLY IT'LL BE USEFUL FOR THE NATION 
TO HAVE THE HERITAGE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS 
I LOVE THAT STORY IF THAT DOESN'T CONVINCE YOU 
THAT LOCAL FRUIT OF ALL KINDS IS TO BE ENCOURAGED WHEREVER POSSIBLE 
THE I GUESS NOTHING WILL 
ANYWAY THAT'S THE END OF TODAY'S FRUITY PROGRAMME 
WE'RE OFF NEXT WEEK BECAUSE OF CRUFTS 
AND IN A FORTNIGHT CAROL WILL BE CELEBRATING THE SPRING GARDENS 
OF DEVON AND CORNWALL 
THEN WE SHALL BE BACK HERE AT BERRYFIELDS 
ON MARCH TWENTY FIRST WHICH IS GOOD FRIDAY 
I'LL SEE YOU HERE THEN BYE BYE 
WE'RE IN POMPEII AND IT'S VOLCANO DAY 
YOU SAVE PEOPLE NOT THIS TIME 
SHOW YOURSELF I MUST MAKE THE MOST TERRIBLE CHOICE 
DONNA DOCTOR
