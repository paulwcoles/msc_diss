THE CASTLE THAT ONCE DOMINATED THE LANDSCAPE HERE 
FELL INTO DISREPAIR IN THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS 
BUT MUCH OF THE STONE WAS USED TO BUILD THIS GATEWAY 
IT ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE BUILDING OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY 
AND SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL 
SO LET'S HOPE THAT TODAY WE CAN BUILD A FANTASTIC RESULT 
WHEN OUR PRECIOUS ANTIQUES GO UNDER THE HAMMER AT AUCTION 
COMING UP ON TODAY'S CASH IN THE ATTIC 
WHAT HAS THIS WOMAN'S HUSBAND DONE TO DESERVE THIS 
HE'S GOT TO SUFFER MORE BEFORE I GIVE IN 
AND WHILE I'M DOING MY BEST TO BE ACCOMMODATING 
THE FIELD SHELTER 
I MEAN THE TRACTOR 
I MEAN THE FIELD SHELTER ANYWAY 
THINGS ONLY GET WORSE 
IF YOU SEND YOUR SECRETARY UP THE ROAD TO BUY ME A PRESENT 
AND SHE COMES BACK WITH BLACK UNDERWEAR YOU'LL BE WEARING IT 
BUT WILL ALL BE FORGIVEN WHEN WE GET TO AUCTION 
AT FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY 
WHAT RESERVE HAVE YOU PUT ON IT 
DON'T ASK ME I CAN'T REMEMBER 
FIND OUT MORE WHEN WE SEE TODAY'S COLLECTIBLES GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
I'M ON MY WAY TO MEET A COUPLE WHO LOVE A CHALLENGE 
THEY'VE CALLED IN THE CASH IN THE ATTIC TEAM 
TO HELP THEM RAISE SOME MUCH NEEDED FUNDS FOR A NEW PROJECT 
IT'S AN ACTIVE LIFE FOR HORSE LOVERS 
MALCOLM AND ANNE STEVENS 
WHO RUN AN EQUESTRIAN FARM IN THE VILLAGE OF CHARLWOOD IN SURREY 
MALCOLM DEALS WITH THE MAINTENANCE OF THE LIVERY YARD 
AND MANAGES TO FIT IN WORK AS A DIRECTOR OF A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY 
WHILE ANNE TENDS TO THE EIGHT HORSES THEY HAVE STABLED HERE 
AS WELL AS LOOKING AFTER A LITTLE BAND OF CHICKENS 
BUT IT'S NOT CHEAP RUNNING THE YARD 
SO THEY NEED ALL THE HELP THEY CAN GET TO FIND HIDDEN TREASURES 
THAT WILL RAISE ENOUGH CASH TO MAKE LIFE THAT LITTLE BIT EASIER DOWN ON THE FARM 
MORNING JONTY HI LORNE HOW ARE YOU 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT IN STORE TODAY 
AS YOU CAN SEE WE'RE ON A VERY NICE FARM BUT IT IS ON THE LARGE SIDE 
I HOPE YOU'RE READY TO MUCK IN YOU KNOW ME 
I ALWAYS COME PREPARED 
THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT COME ON 
TRUST JONTY TO HAVE POSH GREEN WELLIES 
I GO IN SEARCH OF ANNE AND MALCOLM BUT THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE 
GOOD MORNING IT'S TAKEN ME AGES TO FIND YOU 
YOU'VE GOT LOADS OF OUTBUILDINGS 
YES AND YOU'RE HARD AT WORK ABSOLUTELY 
I GUESS YOU HAVEN'T CALLED CASH IN THE ATTIC IN TO HELP BAL THE STRAW HAVE YOU 
DO YOU WANT TO GIVE US A HAND IF YOU'D LIKE TO 
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE GOT SOME ANTIQUES TO SELL 
ALL THE COLLECTIBLES WE'VE ACQUIRED AND INHERITED FROM FAMILY 
ARE IN BOXES AND THEY WILL PROBABLY NEVER COME OUT 
SO IS IT ALL INHERITED NO I USED TO COLLECT THINGS YEARS AGO 
IN HIS PREVIOUS LIFE 
IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE AS WE CALL IT BEFORE I BECAME A MAD FARMER 
SO IF YOU'RE HAPPY TO SELL THEM AND RAISE SOME MONEY 
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW MUCH AND WHAT YOU WANT TO SPEND IT ON 
WE'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO TWO THINGS 
THAT WE'RE IN SLIGHT A DISPUTE ABOUT 
ANNE WOULD LIKE A FIELD SHELTER FOR THE HORSES 
AND I WOULD LIKE A FRONT LOADER 
ON THE LITTLE CHINESE TRACTOR THAT WE HAND BUILT TWO YEARS AGO 
MEN NEVER GIVE UP GADGETS DO THEY 
NO LET'S BE HONEST 
WE ALWAYS WANT TOYS TO PLAY WITH TOYS FOR THE BOYS 
THEY BOTH SOUND QUITE EXPENSIVE 
SO HOW MUCH MONEY ARE YOU LOOKING TO RAISE 
IF WE COULD GET ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THAT WOULD PUT US ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
IT'D BE FANTASTIC 
THEN WE COULD ARGUE ABOUT WHAT TO SPEND IT ON 
BEFORE WE HAVE A DOMESTIC WE NEED TO GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT SOME STUFF 
THERE'S NO TIME FOR MAKING HAY IF WE'RE TO RAISE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
TO GET EITHER A FRONT LOADER FOR THIS TRACTOR 
OR A NICE SHELTER FOR THESE HORSES 
M. M. M. I GET THE FEELING I MIGHT BE TAKING ON THE ROLE OF MEDIATOR TODAY 
YOU'VE GOT LOTS AND LOTS OF OUTBUILDINGS 
SO YOU'VE GOT STUFF PUT ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE 
SO WE'LL HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT TODAY 
JONTY'S ALREADY HERE SO LET'S HOPE HE'S FOUND SOMETHING OF INTEREST 
AND TRUE TO FORM OUR ANTIQUES WHIZ 
HAS ALREADY UNCOVERED SOME PROMISING LITTLE NUMBERS 
AH THERE HE IS HELLO JONTY 
HI GUYS 
THIS LITTLE COLLECTION AMAZING ISN'T IT 
THEY'RE ALL GOSSWARE 
WHICH IS ALL THIS AMAZING LITTLE DECORATIVE TOURIST PIECES 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THEY BECAME SO POPULAR 
IT WAS BECAUSE PEOPLE USED TO GO ON DAY TRIPS 
AND THEY'D BUY ONE OF THESE PIECES OF GOSS WITH WHERE THEY'D BEEN 
YOU'RE RIGHT AND IF I PICK UP THIS LITTLE URN 
THIS ONE COMES FROM ROYAL LEAMINGTON SPA 
AND IT HAS THE TOWN'S CREST ON IT 
IF YOU LOOK ON THE UNDERSIDE IT SAYS GOSS 
THAT'S THE REASON WHY IT'S CALLED GOSS CRESTED WARE 
BECAUSE IT WAS WILLIAM HENRY GOSS WHO FIRST THOUGHT OF THIS IDEA 
THEY BECAME VERY POPULAR IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
AND THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE MASSES COULD AFFORD TO GO ON HOLIDAY 
SO THIS IS THEIR BRIGHTON ROCK 
SO WHAT SORT OF VALUE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT 
LOOKING AT THIS WHOLE COLLECTION HERE 
WE'RE LOOKING AT EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THAT BALL PARK 
IF THEY CAN ALL GO TO AUCTION AND MAKE THAT SORT OF MONEY 
I'LL BE VERY HAPPY 
WE'LL DECIDE WHO'S SPENDING THAT LATER 
LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN FIND 
I'M HAPPY TO LET THE GOSS GO 
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE HAD FOR A LONG TIME BUT TIME TO MOVE ON 
WITH THE POTENTIAL EIGHTY FOR THE FARM FUND 
THAT'S A WISE DECISION AND MEANS WE'RE OFF TO A RESPECTABLE START 
BUT WE'VE A LONG WAY TO GO SO LET'S NOT JUMP THE GUN 
AND JONTY'S KEEN EXPERT EYE TRACKS DOWN ANOTHER LUCRATIVE FIND STOWED SAFELY AWAY 
MALCOLM LOOK 
AH YES ONE OF MY FLINTLOCK PISTOLS 
IS IT HAVE YOU GOT A COLLECTION 
WELL NOT A COLLECTION BUT THAT'S A NICE ONE ISN'T IT 
BEAUTIFUL 
WHAT POSSESSED YOU TO WANT TO BUY A PISTOL LIKE THIS 
AH WELL FORTY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN 
I HAPPENED TO SEE THIS 
AND I THOUGHT WHAT A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IT WAS 
WERE YOU TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
OTHER THAN IT WAS AN HOLSTER PISTOL 
WHICH WOULD'VE BEEN USED BY GENTLEMEN ON HORSEBACK 
I BELIEVE IT'S ENGLISH 
IT'S A FLINTLOCK PISTOL SO THE NAME SUGGESTS CLEARLY WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
SO THE FLINT STRIKES A SMALL AMOUNT OF POWDER IN THERE 
AND OUT COMES YOUR SHOT AT THE OTHER END 
THEY STARTED MAKING THESE FLINTLOCK PISTOLS IN THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS 
BUT THIS ISN'T SIXTEEN HUNDREDS AND IT'S NOT ENGLISH OH 
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS BRASS BUTT END 
DOES THAT NOT LOOK LIKE A MINARET 
IT DOES WHICH GIVES A CLUE AS TO WHERE IT'S FROM 
IT'S FROM THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE SO IT'S TURKISH 
RIGHT 
THIS WAS MADE FOR THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ENGRAVING IT REALLY IS FINE DETAIL 
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS HAND MADE 
SO CERTAINLY THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE WITH THEIR MASS EXPANSION 
EVERY ADULT MALE HAD TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO DATE WISE 
I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT FROM THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS IT'S MORE LIKE EARLY EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
AND VALUE TODAY IN THE MARKET BALL PARK ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY AT AUCTION 
RIGHT 
THEY HAVE TO BE IN VERY GOOD ORDER BEFORE YOU GET HUGE SUMS OF MONEY FOR THEM 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
YES DISAPPOINTED OBVIOUSLY 
ARE YOU HAPPY TO PUT IT IN THE SALE ERM 
IT'LL MORE THAN LIKELY GO IN 
I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED IT WAS TURKISH 
I DID HAVE SOME SUSPICIONS ABOUT IT THOUGH 
BECAUSE THIS FLINTLOCK PISTOL IS FOR DECORATIVE PURPOSES ONLY 
AND NEVER FIRED IT'S EXEMPT FROM A GUN LICENCE 
BUT IT'S STILL WISE TO KEEP IT LOCKED AWAY 
THE SAME GOES FOR THESE SWORDS THAT MALCOLM KEEPS SECURED IN HIS OFFICE 
WHICH INCLUDE A LIGHT CAVALRY SABRE 
HE THINKS WAS USED BY WELLINGTON'S TROOPS IN THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO 
A VICTORIAN DRESS SWORD AND AN INFANTRY OFFICER'S SWORD 
ALL TOGETHER THIS IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION COULD MAKE ONE HUNDRED AT AUCTION 
THE RUMMAGE CONTINUES APACE WHILE JONTY AND ANNE ROUND UP THE VALUABLES 
I GO IN SEARCH OF MALCOLM TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HIS PRECIOUS TRACTOR 
AND SURPRISE SURPRISE JUST LOOK WHERE I FIND HIM 
HELLO MALCOLM IS THIS IT IS THIS THE TRACTOR 
YES THIS IS THE LITTLE TRACTOR 
TELL ME ABOUT THE GADGETS YOU NEED FOR THIS 
THE BIT I WANT TO GO ON IT IS A FRONT LOADING SHOVEL 
WHICH COMES ON THE FRONT HERE 
WHICH LITERALLY WILL PICK UP THINGS FROM THE GROUND LIFT THEM UP 
CARRY THEM AND TIP THEM 
IT WOULD MAKE MY LIFE SO MUCH EASIER RATHER THAN HAVING TO 
PUT EVERYTHING INTO A WHEELBARROW MOVE THE WHEELBARROW AND TIP IT 
I COULD FIX IT TO THE FRONT OF THE MACHINE AND IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC 
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S VITAL I THINK SO 
WHEN YOU CAME TO SEE THIS PLACE 
WHAT MADE YOU THINK I HAVE TO HAVE IT 
I DROVE IN THE GATES AND I JUST LOOKED DOWN THE FIELD 
I SAW THE VIEWS AND I THOUGHT I'VE GOT TO HAVE THIS 
AND WE DECIDED TO COME UP HERE LOCK STOCK AND BARREL 
SO WHAT DO YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY THINK OF ALL THIS 
THEY THINK WE'RE MAD 
HERE WE ARE SIXTY SIXTY FIVE EMBARKING ON WORKING SIX TO SEVEN DAYS A WEEK 
BUT WE ENJOY IT 
WE'RE LOOKING TO RAISE SOME MONEY 
BUT HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT SELLING SOME OF YOUR COLLECTIONS 
WELL I NEED TO MOVE ON TIMES HAVE CHANGED 
WE ENJOY THE OUTSIDE LIFE 
I DON'T NECESSARILY ENJOY SITTING INDOORS 
LOOKING AT MY ANTIQUE BOOKS 
OR LOOKING AT SOME OF MY ITEMS THAT I'VE GOT 
OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED THIS VITAL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT FOR THE TRACTOR 
AND ANNE IS REALLY LOOKING FOR THIS ANIMAL SHELTER 
WHO DO YOU THINK'S GOING TO WIN 
I THINK SHE'S GOT A GOOD CHANCE OF GETTING IT 
IN THAT CASE WE NEED TO FIND OUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE TO SELL 
AH WHAT A SOFTIE BUT MALCOLM DOESN'T HAVE TO GIVE IN JUST YET 
THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF WORK TO BE DONE 
AND NOT JUST FOR THE RUMMAGE 
WHILE ANNE NIPS OFF TO CATCH UP ON SOME CHORES 
OUR EXPERT EXTRAORDINAIRE FINDS THIS ROYAL DOULTON DINNER SERVICE 
THAT ANNE INHERITED FROM HER MOTHER 
IT'S NO LONGER PRODUCED BY THE WORLD RENOWNED ENGLISH POTTERY 
SO COULD COOK UP SOME INTERESTING BIDS AT AUCTION 
I'M NOT LETTING DOWN THE SIDE EITHER 
ANNE AND I ARE CONDUCTING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF HER BEDROOM 
AND IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE I STUMBLE UPON A BIT OF A GEM 
OH A. N. N. I THINK I'VE FOUND SOMETHING 
THIS IS REALLY PRETTY WHAT'S THE BACKGROUND 
THAT'S COME DOWN THROUGH MY FAMILY 
IT WOULD'VE BEEN MY GRANDMOTHER'S 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL DO YOU WEAR IT I'VE NEVER WORN IT 
IS IT SOMETHING YOU MIGHT THINK OF SELLING YES 
JONTY ARE YOU OUT THERE HERE LOOK AT THIS IT'S LOVELY 
WOW I SAY WHAT A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BROOCH 
NOW THAT'S A RUBY ON THE INSIDE THERE AND THE COLOUR OF THE GOLD 
IS NINE CARAT SO THAT'S A NINE CARAT GOLD BROOCH 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOX BECAUSE THIS IS THE ORIGINAL PRESENTATION BOX 
IT REALLY IS IN PRISTINE CONDITION 
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NEVER BEEN OPENED QUITE EXTRAORDINARY 
LOOK AT THE STYLE OF THE WRITING 
THIS IS THE RETAILER THE GOLDSMITH YOU CAN DATE THAT SIMPLY BY THE BOX 
REALLY THAT'S PROBABLY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SO IT'S VICTORIAN 
BROOCHES LIKE THIS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN FASHION 
REALLY SINCE THE BRONZE AGE THEY WERE KNOWN AS FIBULAS 
CAN YOU TELL WHETHER THAT'S A GOOD QUALITY RUBY 
THEY WOULD REALLY VARY 
WHAT ONE NEEDS TO DO IS HAVE A REALLY CLOSE LOOK UNDER A MICROSCOPE 
VALUE WISE YOU'RE NOT TALKING A HUGE SUM OF MONEY BECAUSE DEALERS 
HAVE TO BUY THIS TO MAKE A PROFIT SO YOU'RE TALKING WHAT FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED 
O. K. I WOULD HOPE IT WOULD BE THE HIGHER END BUT THERE YOU GO 
HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT 
I'M THINKING A GREAT BIG TIARA MATCHING NECKLACE 
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING 
I'VE NEVER WORN IT MY MOTHER I CAN'T RECALL EVER WORE IT 
SO I DON'T THINK IT HAS SUCH A HUGE SENTIMENTAL VALUE 
THAT I'M NOT PREPARED TO PART WITH IT 
SO I'M QUITE HAPPY FOR THAT TO GO FORWARD TO THE AUCTION 
ANNE ALSO DECIDES THAT THESE HAND MADE N. A. O. FIGURINES 
SHE COLLECTS ON TRIPS TO SPAIN CAN BE GIVEN UP FOR THE FARM FUND 
ALL THREE PORCELAIN PIECES DATE FROM THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
AND WERE PRODUCED BY VETERAN CRAFTSMEN 
AT THE POTTERY'S WORKSHOPS NEAR THE SPANISH CITY OF VALENCIA 
THERE'S NO REINING IN MYSELF OR ANNE 
BUT WHILE WE'RE DRIVING FORWARD IN OUR QUEST TO HIT OUR TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TARGET 
WE'RE BEING OVERTAKEN BY AN INSATIABLE JONTY 
MALCOLM 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THIS THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL BEAST 
SO IS THIS AN OLD FRIEND 
IS IT SOMETHING YOU'VE USED DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT 
NO IT HASN'T BEEN USED 
HISTORICALLY MODEL YACHTS 
MODEL BOATS HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS 
THEY WERE THE ONES WHO PUT THEIR MODEL BOATS INTO TOMBS 
TO TAKE THEM INTO THE NEXT WORLD THE AFTERLIFE 
OH RIGHT BUT REALLY PRIOR TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
THE BEGINNING PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
SHIPS BOATS YACHTS WERE NOT BUILT FROM PLANS 
THEY WERE JUST SOLELY BUILT BY SCALE MODELS 
AH 
THAT'S THE REASON WHY YOU SEE SO MANY 
CERTAINLY AT MARITIME MUSEUMS 
YOU SEE THESE AMAZING FABULOUS QUALITY SHIPS AND BOATS 
IN THESE WONDERFUL CASES BUT ALSO IN THE VICTORIAN TIMES 
THEY USED MODEL YACHTS LIKE THIS OF SIMILAR STYLE TO BE BOYS' TOYS 
NOT ONLY WERE THEY BOYS' TOYS THEY WERE GROWN UP BOYS TOO 
YOU AND I WOULD BE PLAYING WITH THESE ON THE POND FOR INSTANCE 
THIS MODEL HERE HOWEVER 
IS STYLED PROBABLY ON A TWENTIES YACHT BETWEEN THE WARS 
A YACHT IN FULL SAIL LIKE THIS STILL LOOKS VERY DRAMATIC 
THAT'S WHY IT CAUGHT MY EYE 
YEAH SO WE CAN CERTAINLY PUT THAT INTO AUCTION 
WHAT DID YOU PAY FOR IT 
I DIDN'T PAY ANYTHING FOR IT 
NOTHING AT ALL 
I RELIEVED IT FROM A SKIP 
EXCELLENT 
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THAT AND THERE'S A SMALL MODEL YACHT 
I'VE JUST SEEN UP THERE AS WELL SITTING UP THERE 
BUT WE PUT THOSE TWO TOGETHER AT AUCTION SEVENTY TO NINETY QUID 
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD DEAL 
ONWARDS AND UPWARDS O. K. 
I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THOSE 
FOR SOMETHING THAT I SAVED FROM BEING SMASHED TO SMITHEREENS 
A VERY GOOD RESULT 
VERY PLEASED WITH THAT THANKS GUYS 
WE'RE ALWAYS HAPPY TO OBLIGE MALCOLM 
I HAVE TO SAY THE STEVENS' HOME IS GIVING UP A WEALTH OF TREASURES 
A. N. N. COMES ACROSS THESE LIMITED EDITION STERLING SILVER PLATES 
DEPICTING TRADITIONAL COUNTRYSIDE HUNTING SCENES 
THAT MIGHT NOT BE TO EVERYONE'S TASTE BUT COULD ADD ANOTHER FIFTY TO THE FARM FUND 
WHILE JONTY AND MALCOLM CONTINUE TO SCOUR EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY FOR MORE DESIRABLE COLLECTIBLES 
I WANT TO HEAR FROM A. N. N. ALL ABOUT HER BELOVED LIVERY YARD 
HELLO A. N. N. 
WHO'S THIS THIS IS BOUNTY 
OH HE'S LOVELY ISN'T HE 
SHALL I STOP HIM YES HELLO 
HELLO YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL AREN'T YOU 
SO IS THIS YOUR FAVOURITE HORSE 
HE WAS MY FIRST HORSE HE WAS MY FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY PRESENT 
OH HOW LOVELY 
HE SAID TO ME WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY 
COS YOU'RE FIFTY YOU CAN HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL RIGHT 
I SAID YES O. K. BUT IF YOU SEND YOUR SECRETARY TO BUY ME A PRESENT 
AND SHE COMES BACK WITH A LOAD OF BLACK UNDERWEAR FOR ME 
YOU'LL BE WEARING IT 
SO HE SAID GIVE ME A CLUE WHAT D'YOU WANT 
I SAID I WANT MY OWN HORSE 
AND I GOT BOUNTY SO 
HE'S WITH ME FOR LIFE NOW SO 
SO DO YOU RIDE A LOT 
NOT AS MUCH AS I USED TO 
COS I'M SIXTY IN MAY AND WHEN WE MOVED HERE OBVIOUSLY 
MY TIME'S DIVIDED AMONGST ALL THE OTHER JOBS THAT WE HAVE TO DO 
SO TO MAKE IT LESS FRANTIC RIDING WISE 
I HAVE TAUGHT HIM WESTERN RIDING 
SO I'VE SLOWED DOWN ALL HIS PACES SO HE WILL NOW JOG INSTEAD OF TROT 
AND IN HIS PAST TRAINING IN ENGLISH RIDING 
YOU'RE ALWAYS DRIVING THEM FORWARD TO GET A MORE ACTIVE THIS AND THAT 
AND NOW I'VE ASKED HIM TO DO DON'T DO ACTIVE PLEASE 
DO FLOPPING ABOUT MORE 
AND HE'S FINE WITH THAT COS HE'S GETTING OLDER AS WELL AS ME 
SO IS THE FIELD SHELTER FOR HIM 
IT'S TO BE SHARED BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE TOP OF THE HILL 
WE'RE VERY VERY EXPOSED TO THE HIGH WINDS 
SO I REALLY NEED TO HAVE SOMEWHERE WHERE THE HORSES CAN JUST 
TUCK THEMSELVES AWAY FROM THE WIND AND RAIN 
AND WHAT'S MALCOLM'S VIEW ON THAT 
WELL HE THINKS THAT HORSES CAN JUST TURN THEIR BOTTOMS TO THE WIND 
AND GET ON WITH IT BECAUSE HE'S GOT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO SPEND THE MONEY ON 
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A REASONABLY FAIR COMMENT 
AND UM 
SO YES SO THE LITTLE ARGUMENT CONTINUES 
BUT HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS TRACTOR APPENDAGE THEN 
HE'S GOT TO SUFFER MORE BEFORE I GIVE IN 
LET'S SEE HOW MUCH HE IS SUFFERING 
LET'S SEE IF THEY'VE FOUND ANYTHING TO SELL COME ON BOUNTY 
A. N. N. AND MALCOLM ARE BOTH DETERMINED 
TO GET THEIR OWN WAY ON THE FARM 
MALCOLM NEEDS THAT FRONT LOADER FOR HIS TRACTOR 
BUT A. N. N. IS DESPERATE TO GIVE THE HORSES A FIELD SHELTER 
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO END BUT WE'RE GALLOPING AHEAD WITH THE RUMMAGE 
WE HAVE TO KEEP UP THE PACE IF WE'RE TO HIT OUR TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TARGET 
OTHERWISE THEY'LL BOTH BE BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED 
NO ONE IS GETTING AN EASY RIDE 
AND IF IT IS A COMPETITION IS MALCOLM ABOUT TO PLAY HIS JOKER 
I'VE GOT THESE JONTY WHAT HAVE YOU GOT 
I'VE GOT A COLLECTION OF MEDALS OH WOW 
SOME FROM THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND SOME FROM PRIOR TO THAT 
EARLIER THAN THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
OH YES I'VE ACTUALLY GOT THAT LITTLE COLLECTION THERE 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE THIS IS THE AFGHAN AFGHANISTAN MEDAL 
YES ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT WE'VE GOT AN INDIAN ELEPHANT THERE 
IT KIND OF LIKE SUMS UP THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE OF THE PLACE 
QUITE EXTRAORDINARY 
AND A CRIMEA MEDAL YES WOW 
I ACTUALLY HAVE THESE TWO GENTLEMEN'S SERVICE HISTORY 
WHERE THEY ENLISTED WHERE THEY WERE BORN 
WHAT SCARS THEY HAD ON THEIR BODIES WHEN THEY ENLISTED 
HOW DID YOU FIND ALL THAT OUT 
WELL YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET THAT INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT SOURCES 
SO ALL THESE MEDALS HERE ARE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
PART OF THE EMPIRE CAMPAIGNS YES 
SO THAT'S WONDERFUL WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT HERE 
AGAIN EXACTLY THE SAME PERIOD 
WE'VE GOT THESE TWO BARS AS WELL SO THAT MAKES THAT INTERESTING 
WHEN IT COMES TO MEDALS IT'S NOT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL 
IT'S ALSO WHAT THEY DID 
SO IF YOU'VE GOT THAT MAGIC COMBINATION OF A RARE MEDAL 
AND AN INTERESTING RECIPIENT OF THAT MEDAL 
THEN YOU'RE TALKING OFTEN LARGE SUMS OF MONEY 
COS THOSE ARE THE ONES THE RARE ONES 
THAT THE COLLECTORS REALLY WANT 
LET'S CONSIDER VALUE WE'VE GOT THE INDIAN GENERAL SERVICE MEDAL 
WITH THE ONE BAR THAT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AT AUCTION 
THE ONE WITH THE TWO BARS IS GOING TO BE MORE LIKE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AT AUCTION O. K. 
THE AFGHANISTAN CAMPAIGN MEDAL HERE THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT MEDAL 
THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TO TWO HUNDRED 
GOOD I CAN SEE HERE COLLECTION JUST AS A ROUGH BALLPARK 
PROBABLY AROUND THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MARK 
FANTASTIC ARE YOU HAPPY ABOUT THAT MOST CERTAINLY 
SO ARE YOU READY TO LET THESE GO NOW 
I THINK SO I'VE GOT TO LET THEM GO 
GOOD O. K. LET'S SOLDIER ON 
THESE MEDALS COULD BRING IN MORE THAN HALF OUR TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TARGET 
BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE DAY 
IF THE RIGHT COLLECTORS ARE THERE 
WHETHER THEY REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL 
NOTHING IN LIFE IS GUARANTEED 
THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT LEAVING ANYTHING TO CHANCE 
AND EVERY SPACE IS GETTING A THOROUGH GOING OVER 
MEANWHILE JONTY WHO JUST LOVES HIS FURNITURE 
LOOKS ENTHRALLED 
A. N. N. 
COME AND HAVE A LOOK AT THIS BUREAU WITH ME YES 
IS THERE A STORY TO THIS OR IS IT SOMETHING YOU MIGHT SELL 
IT DOES HAVE A STORY MY MOTHER WORKED IN AN OFFICE IN LONDON 
AND DURING THE WAR THE OFFICES WERE BOMBED 
THE STAFF WERE TOLD TO TAKE OUT ANYTHING FROM THE DAMAGE 
THAT THEY MIGHT LIKE TO HAVE MY MOTHER HAD ALWAYS ADMIRED THIS DESK 
WHICH AT THE TIME WAS LIMED OAK 
BUT THIS DESK ACTUALLY BELONGED TO THE OFFICE BOY AT THE TIME 
AND THE NAME OF THE OFFICE BOY WAS HARDY AMIES 
DRESSMAKER TO THE QUEEN WOW 
SO SHE TOOK IT HOME AND CLEANED IT UP 
AND THEN IT LOST THE LIMED FINISH AND IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS EVER SINCE 
SO IT'S CHANGED COLOUR IT'S NOW GONE THAT SORT OF POLISHED OAK 
SO IT ALMOST LOOKS AS YOU'VE CUT THE OAK TREE IT'S MORE NATURAL LOOKING 
WHEREAS LIMED OAK AS THE NAMES SUGGEST 
LITERALLY BLEACHES THE OAK SO IT HAS THAT GREENY HUE TO IT YES 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STYLE HERE 
IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A PRE WAR PIECE OF FURNITURE 
THIS IS A BUREAU SO IT'S A FULL FRONT 
YOU'VE GOT THESE TWO ARMS THAT SUPPORT THAT 
DOWN BELOW WE HAVE THIS SIMPLE CONSTRUCTION THE TWO DRAWERS 
BUT FROM A STYLISTIC POINT OF VIEW THESE HANDLES HERE ARE ART DECO 
SO SIMPLICITY WAS THE NAME OF THE GAME 
AND THEN ON THE BASE HERE WE'RE ON THESE FOUR SQUARE LEGS 
CHAMFERED ON THE INSIDE 
I THINK THIS IS A FABULOUS FABULOUS STORY YOU'VE JUST TOLD ME 
BUT WHAT WE NEED IS PROOF 
FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAD A PICTURE OF THE OFFICE BOY 
THE THEN TO BE OR SOON TO BE DRESSMAKER TO THE QUEEN 
SITTING AT THIS DESK THEN IT WOULD MAKE A FANTASTIC STORY 
IT WOULD THEREFORE BE SOMETHING YOU COULD THEN SELL ON YEAH 
BUT JUST HEARSAY I'M AFRAID IN OUR BUSINESS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH 
DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING 
AS A CONSEQUENCE WE'RE LOOKING AT FORTY TO SIXTY ONLY AT AUCTION 
WOULD YOU CONSIDER PUTTING THAT INTO THE SALE 
I'M NOT SURE I'D LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT IS QUITE DINKY 
AND THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME SENTIMENTALITY 
WE'LL LEAVE THAT THERE YOU NEED SOME EXTRA TIME TO THINK ABOUT THAT 
SO WE'LL CARRY ON SEARCHING 
I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PART WITH IT 
IT'S QUITE SMALL I CAN FIT IT INTO A CORNER I MIGHT JUST KEEP IT 
A. N. N. DOES SEEM RELUCTANT TO GIVE UP THIS BUREAU WITH ROYAL CONNECTIONS 
AND AS WE'RE INTO THE FINAL STAGE OF THE RUMMAGE 
WE'LL NEED TO GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT 
MY EFFORTS PAY OFF WITH THESE ROYAL DOULTON FIGURINES FROM THE MINIATURE LADIES COLLECTION 
THEY INCLUDE KAREN AND NINETTE MODELS 
CREATED BY POPULAR DESIGNER PEGGY DAVIES 
WHO REIGNED AT THE POTTERY FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
IT'S THE HOME STRETCH AND MALCOLM COMES UP TRUMPS 
WITH A RATHER FIERCE LOOKING WEAPON 
BUT DON'T WORRY IT'S NORMALLY SAFELY LOCKED AWAY 
JONTY WHAT HAVE YOU GOT 
THIS IS A FRENCH PERCUSSION RIFLE 
WOW 
QUITE EXTRAORDINARY IT'S 
SO IT LOOKS SORT OF EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY DOESN'T IT 
YES IT IS IT IS YES 
THIS WILL HAVE BEEN IT'S A FRENCH RIFLE 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED AGAINST THE BRITISH ARMY 
DURING THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO 
AND POSSIBLY ALL THROUGH THE PENINSULA CAMPAIGNS WITH WELLINGTON 
SO IF WE ARE TALKING LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY 
WE HAVE TO BE TALKING FOUR HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED FOR THAT KIND OF BALL PARK 
NOW THERE'S A QUESTION MARK ONE HAVE OVER THIS RIFLE 
BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT THERE WERE LITERALLY 
HUNDREDS OF REPRODUCTIONS MADE IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES RIGHT 
AND THEY WERE MADE IN INDIA RIGHT 
AND THEY WERE LITERALLY MADE OF OLD PARTS 
SO HAVE YOU HAD IT TO BITS AT ALL 
YES I HAVE TAKEN THE MECHANISM OUT FROM THE LOCK 
AND STAMPED ON THE BACK OF THAT IS THE MAKER'S MARK 
SAINT ETIENNE IN FRANCE 
WHICH WOULD ALL MAKE SENSE YEP 
SO THAT LOCK MIGHT WELL BE ORIGINAL 
BUT WHEN I LOOK CLOSELY OVER HERE 
I'M A BIT CONCERNED THAT THAT'S NOT TWO HUNDRED YEARS' WORTH OF WEAR THERE 
SO THERE ARE HUGE QUESTION MARKS 
ALSO THE WIDTH OF THE BASE OF THE BARREL HERE 
ON AN ORIGINAL RIFLE THAT SHOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE THE CASE 
SO WE'RE TALKING TWO FIGURES HERE POSSIBLY FOUR HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED 
FOUR HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED FOR THAT 
WELL I'VE GOT A BIT OF A QUESTION MARK ON THIS RIFLE HERE 
SO I NEED TO TAKE IT ALONG TO THE AUCTION ROOM TO DO SO MORE INVESTIGATION 
O. K. SO I WOULDN'T EVEN BRING A TOTAL INTO OUR FINAL TOTALS TODAY AT ALL 
O. K. SO THE VERDICT'S OUT ON THAT 
BUT WE KNOW YOU'VE HAD PLENTY OF ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES 
THAT ARE VERY NICE AND SALEABLE ITEMS 
YOU WANTED TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DIDN'T YOU FOR THE FIELD SHELTER YES 
I MEAN TRACTOR GADGET I MEAN THE FIELD SHELTER 
ANYWAY FOR SOME VERY IMPORTANT STUFF FOR THE FARM 
HOW DO YOU FEEL IT'S GONE TODAY ARE YOU PLEASED WITH THE VALUATIONS 
YES I THINK WE'RE 
IT LOOKS AS IF IT COULD BE PROMISING 
O. K. WELL THE GRAND TOTAL IS TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIVE 
TO BE FAIR THAT DOES INCLUDE THE DESK 
AND I KNOW YOU'RE IN TWO MINDS ABOUT THAT 
SO IF THE DESK DOESN'T GO TO AUCTION IT WILL BE A LITTLE LESS THAN THAT 
BUT CERTAINLY OVER TWO THOUSAND ARE YOU PLEASED WITH THAT THAT'S GREAT 
WE'VE GOT SO MUCH MILITARIA HERE SO MUCH MILITARIA THAT I SUGGEST 
WE TAKE IT ALL TO A SPECIALIST SALE 
AND ALL THE OTHER ITEMS CAN GO TO A GENERAL SALE 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE BUSY AREN'T YOU SO ARE YOU 
IF YOU'RE OFF TO AUCTION WHO'S GOING TO BE MUCKING OUT THE STABLES 
LOOKS LIKE THAT'S ME 
SO THE STEVENS' HAVE GOT NOT ONE BUT TWO AUCTIONS TO GET READY FOR 
AND SOME EXCEPTIONAL ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES TO SET HEARTS RACING 
INCLUDING 
ANN'S HEIRLOOM THE DELICATE VICTORIAN BAR BROOCH 
THAT COULD PIN DOWN ONE HUNDRED 
THE MODEL YACHTS MALCOLM RESCUED FROM A SKIP 
JONTY'S VALUED BETWEEN SEVENTY AND NINETY 
THE STRIKING COLLECTION OF ANTIQUE SWORDS 
THAT COULD CUT A DEAL WORTH UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND A BIG QUESTION MARK HANGS OVER MALCOLM'S FRENCH PERCUSSION RIFLE 
COULD IT BE THE REAL DEAL AND FIRE UP OUR FUND BY FOUR HUNDRED 
STILL TO COME ON CASH IN THE ATTIC 
IS IT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM IN THE GENERAL SALE 
SIXTY O. K. WHAT'S YOUR VIEW ON THAT 
SOMEBODY'S GOT A BARGAIN 
DO THINGS GET MORE DESPERATE AT OUR MILITARY SPECIALIST 
IF YOU ARE FURNISHING A PUB OR AN OLD HOUSE 
AND YOU WANT SOMETHING FOR THE MANTELPIECE IT LOOKS THE PART 
OR WILL WE END UP CELEBRATING WHEN WE GET TO THE MILITARY SALE 
HOW D'YOU FEEL NOW GOOD 
ALL WILL BE REVEALED WHEN THE HAMMER FALLS 
IT'S LESS THAN A WEEK SINCE WE WERE ON THE FARM WITH A. N. N. AND MALCOLM 
WE FOUND LOTS OF INTERESTING ITEMS SOME OF WHICH WE'VE BROUGHT HERE 
TO SWORDERS AUCTION HOUSE IN STANSTED MOUNTFITCHET IN ESSEX 
REMEMBER A. N. N. AND MALCOLM ARE LOOKING TO RAISE AROUND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
AND THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE SPENT 
EITHER ON A FIELD SHELTER OR A TRACTOR FRONT LOADER FOR THE FARM 
DEPENDING ON WHO YOU SPEAK TO OF COURSE 
EITHER WAY WE NEED TO MAKE PLENTY OF MONEY LET'S HOPE WE GET OFF TO A GOOD START 
IT'S THE FIRST SALE AT SWORDERS' NEW AUCTION HOUSE 
JUST UP THE ROAD FROM THEIR OLD PLACE 
A CHANGE OF SCENERY HASN'T PUT OFF THE REGULARS WHO HAVE TURNED UP EAGER TO SNAP UP A BARGAIN 
INCLUDING OUR VERY OWN JONTY 
WHO SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN A SHINE TO MALCOLM'S MODEL YACHT 
HE'S STILL A YOUNG BOY AT HEART 
GOOD MORNING JONTY FEEL LIKE SAILING AWAY DO YOU 
NO THAT'S GOING TO BE SAILING OUT OF THE AUCTION 
NOW WE'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE ALREADY 
I'M INTERESTED TO KNOW IF THEY'VE BROUGHT THAT DESK 
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT SO I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THEY HAVE OR NOT 
BECAUSE A. N. N. WAS VERY ATTACHED TO THAT A LOVELY STORY TO IT 
SHALL WE GO AND FIND OUT WHAT RESERVES WE'VE GOT ON WHAT COME ON 
THIS IS THE FIRST OF TWO AUCTIONS FOR A. N. N. AND MALCOLM 
THEIR GENERAL ITEMS GO UNDER THE HAMMER TODAY 
WHILE MALCOLM'S MILITARY CONNECTION WILL GO INTO A SPECIALIST SALE IN A FEW DAYS' TIME 
GOOD MORNING HOW ARE YOU WE'RE VERY WELL 
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO SEE YOUR LITTLE BITS AND PIECES HERE NOW 
YEAH WELL THEY LOOK QUITE SWEET ON THAT TABLE 
ONE THING WE HAVE NOT SPOTTED IS YOUR DESK HAVE YOU BROUGHT IT 
NO I DIDN'T BRING IT IT'S STILL AT HOME IN PRIDE OF PLACE 
AND I JUST COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO LET IT GO 
TOO MUCH SENTIMENTAL VALUE 
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH NOW THE BROOCH IN THAT LOVELY ORIGINAL BOX 
JONTY THINKS YOU'VE PUT A RESERVE ON THAT IS THAT RIGHT 
I DIDN'T PUT A FIXED RESERVE ON IT I'VE LEFT IT WITH 
A DISCRETIONARY RESERVE ON THE ESTIMATE THAT JONTY PLACED 
WHAT'S A DISCRETIONARY RESERVE JONTY HOW DOES THAT WORK 
IT MEANS THAT THE AUCTIONEER USES THE LOWER END OF THE ESTIMATE 
AND HE USUALLY USES TEN PER CENT SOMETIMES TWENTY PER CENT DISCRETION ON THAT 
FOR FIFTY SOMETIMES AN AUCTIONEER MIGHT SELL AT TEN 
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT THAT DISCRETIONARY RESERVE IT'S REALLY FORTY THAT HE'LL USE AS THE THE LOWER END 
BUT I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE WE'LL DO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT 
THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE HERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY DIG DEEP INTO THEIR POCKETS 
SHALL WE GET INTO POSITION 
COME ON THEN FOLLOW JONTY 
SO WE'RE MINUS THE OAK CABINET 
THAT COULD HAVE BUMPED UP OUR TOTAL BY SIXTY 
BUT THERE IS A SPECIALIST MILITARY AUCTION TO COME 
SO WE'RE NOT SOLELY RELYING ON TODAY'S SALE TO HIT OUR TARGET 
BEFORE WE SADDLE UP FOR THE MAIN EVENT 
WE GET AN IDEA OF HOW OUR LOTS COULD PERFORM FROM AUCTIONEER JAMES FLETCHER 
THE SUN IS SHINING THAT ALWAYS HELPS 
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF GOODS ON OFFER 
WHICH SHOULD MEET A READY MARKET FOR THOSE WHO ARE COLLECTING ITEMS 
DO REMEMBER IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY OR SELL AT AUCTION 
YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY VARIOUS FEES SUCH AS COMMISSION 
WHICH MAY VARY BETWEEN AUCTION HOUSES 
RIGHT MORNING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
OUR AUCTIONEER IS IN POSITION AND THERE IS A PALPABLE AIR OF ANTICIPATION 
WITH ALL THE BIDDERS AT THE READY 
WE'RE STRAIGHT IN TO OUR FIRST LOT OF THE DAY 
LOT EIGHTEEN A IS THE SMALL WOODEN MODEL OF A YACHT AND A LARGER MODERN EXAMPLE 
THE PRISTINE MODEL BOATS THAT MALCOLM AMAZINGLY SALVAGED FROM A SKIP 
MALCOLM REMIND US HOW MUCH YOU PAID FOR THIS MODEL BOAT 
THEY DIDN'T COST ME ANYTHING 
SO ANY MONEY IS GOOD MONEY IS GOOD MONEY 
FIFTY TO START ME 
WELL THIRTY THEN SURELY 
THIRTY I'M BID AT THIRTY THIRTY COME ON 
THIRTY FIVE FORTY FORTY FIVE FIFTY 
FIFTY FIVE THERE AT FIFTY FIVE 
THIS IS GOOD YES 
AT FIFTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE 
STILL THERE AT SIXTY FIVE 
AT SIXTY FIVE ARE YOU ALL FINISHED AND DONE WITH THAT AT SIXTY FIVE 
I'M SELLING AT SIXTY FIVE 
WELL DONE SIXTY FIVE AND IT CAME OUT OF A SKIP 
I SHALL BE GOING OUT WITH THE HORSE AND THE CART 
GOING ROUND ALL THE SKIPS IN OUR AREA PICKING EVERYTHING OUT 
THAT'S MONEY FOR OLD ROPE 
EVEN IF THE SALE PRICE SUNK BELOW OUR BOTTOM ESTIMATE 
BUT IT'S A START 
O. K. NOW OUR NEXT LOT IS THE PAIR OF STERLING SILVER LIMITED EDITION PLATES 
WINTER FOX AND RIDING INTO THE HUNT 
WHAT'S THE BACKGROUND TO THOSE 
MY MOTHER GAVE THEM TO ME 
I DON'T THINK SHE REALISED THAT I WASN'T KEEN ON FOX HUNTING 
RIGHT O. K. 
YES RATHER A CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT 
BUT WITH AN ESTIMATE OF FIFTY TO SEVENTY FOR THE PAIR 
WE CAN'T COMPLAIN TOO MUCH IF THEY HELP TOWARDS THE FARM FUND 
I'M STARTING THESE AT SIXTY FIVE 
SIXTY FIVE I'M BID AT SIXTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE AT SIXTY FIVE 
AT SIXTY FIVE 
ARE YOU ALL FINISHED AND DONE 
IT'S A MAIDEN BID OF SIXTY FIVE 
SIXTY FIVE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT 
I THINK THAT'S QUITE GOOD ACTUALLY I'M HAPPY WITH THAT YEP 
ANOTHER SATISFIED CUSTOMER BUT IT'S A SALE WHICH IS A STERLING RESULT 
CONSIDERING WE'VE GOT A TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TARGET SO EVERY LITTLE COUNTS 
AND WHEN OUR NEXT LOT THE SPANISH N. A. O. FIGURINES GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
THEY USE THEIR MEDITERRANEAN CHARM 
TO GO FOR FORTY FIVE AND HELP US NUDGE TOWARDS OUR TARGET 
AT THIRTY FIVE ARE YOU ALL FINISHED AND DONE 
THE AUCTION ROOM HASN'T THINNED OUT AND WITH ALL OF THESE BIDDERS 
STILL PRIMED FOR ACTION WE NEED THEM TO STUMP UP SOME CASH 
SO NEXT UP IS THE COLLECTION OF GOSS CRESTED WARE WHICH I FOUND 
ARE YOU HAPPY TO SEE THIS GOING 
YES WE ARE IT'S BEEN IN A BOX FOR FOUR YEARS HASN'T IT 
AND I'M STARTING THIS AT FIFTY FIVE 
FIFTY FIVE I'M BID AT FIFTY FIVE 
AT FIFTY FIVE 
AT FIFTY FIVE AT FIFTY FIVE 
WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE THAT 
NO I THINK THE ONLY COMMISSION BID THERE WAS AROUND FIFTY FIVE 
AND HE HASN'T SOLD IT FOR THAT SO IT MEANS IT'LL BE GOING BACK HOME 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT MALCOLM 
WELL WE MAY LEAVE IT HERE FOR ANOTHER AUCTION 
A GOOD IDEA ESPECIALLY FOR ANNE WHO IS KEEN TO KEEP HER DUSTING TO A MINIMUM 
WE NEED AS MUCH CASH AS WE CAN GET TO HELP ANNE AND MALCOLM ON THE FARM 
BUT THINGS ARE LOOKING EXTREMELY SHAKY NOW 
WITH MALCOLM'S MILITARY COLLECTION GOING TO A SPECIALIST AUCTION 
WE'VE ONLY THREE LOTS LEFT IN THIS GENERAL SALE 
AND SO FAR WE'VE HARDLY DENTED OUR TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TARGET 
WE NEED TO AVERT A MINI DISASTER BUT BEST KEEP ON A BRAVE FACE 
THE VICTORIAN PIN BROOCH IS UP NEXT AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S MORE BAD NEWS 
ON CLOSER INSPECTION WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT THE RUBY GEMSTONE IS IN FACT A GARNET 
WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY LESS IN VALUE BUT IT STILL CAUGHT THE EYE OF AUCTIONEER JAMES FLETCHER 
THE BROOCH ALWAYS MEETS DEMAND 
VICTORIAN JEWELLERY IS INDIVIDUAL 
SOMEBODY WILL SNAP THIS UP I'M SURE 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT GO FOR OOH ONE HUNDRED 
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
I DON'T KNOW I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THIS IS GOING TO SELL 
REMEMBER ANNE HAS PLACED A DISCRETIONARY RESERVE ON THE BROOCH'S LOWER ESTIMATE OF FIFTY 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DO NOT THINK THIS IS GOING TO SELL 
DON'T SAY THAT 
AT THIRTY FIVE AT THIRTY FIVE FORTY FORTY FIVE 
FIFTY FIFTY THERE AT FIFTY 
ALL FINISHED AND DONE WITH AT FIFTY 
SOLD AT FIFTY 
FIFTY SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT 
THAT IS O. K. ARE YOU HAPPY 
YES I AM 
ANNE DOESN'T LOOK TOO CONVINCED BUT IT'S ANOTHER SALE AND ALL FOR 
A GOOD CAUSE IF IT'S GOING TO HELP HER HORSES GET THEIR FIELD SHELTER 
THE PRICE THAT IT EVENTUALLY ACHIEVED WAS FAIR ENOUGH 
DISAPPOINTING THAT IT WAS NOT A RUBY STONE 
BUT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR THE GARNET 
NEXT THE ROYAL DOULTON MINIATURE LADIES GO UNDER THE HAMMER AND TURN SOME HEADS 
TO ADD SEVENTY FIVE INTO THE FARM FUND 
THE END OF THE GENERAL AUCTION IS IN SIGHT AND OUR LAST LOT UP FOR GRABS WHICH WILL HAVE TO STORM 
TO THE FINAL POST IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF HITTING OUR ELUSIVE TARGET 
SIXTY A IS THE ROYAL DOULTON DINNER AND TEA SERVICE 
WITH ALL THE WASHING UP THIS INVOLVED 
ANNE WAS HAPPY TO LET IT GO BUT WILL THEY MANAGE TO CLEAN UP TODAY 
TWENTY FIVE THEN AT TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE 
THIRTY THIRTY FIVE FORTY THERE AT FORTY 
FORTY FIVE FIFTY FIFTY 
FIFTY FIVE SIXTY SIXTY AT SIXTY 
YOU ALL FINISHED AND DONE 
RIGHT SIXTY 
WHAT DO YOU FEEL ON THAT SOMEBODY HAS GOT A BARGAIN 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SET 
YOU DO ON THAT ONE 
THE ROYAL DOULTON DINNER SERVICE JUST MANAGED TO PIP 
ITS BOTTOM RESERVE WHICH SADLY HAS BEEN A BIT OF A THEME TODAY 
THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT NOW AS WE HAVE COME TO THE END OF THE AUCTION AND THE QUESTION IS 
ARE WE STILL IN THE RACE FOR OUR TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TARGET 
RIGHT THAT'S THE END OF OUR LOT THAT WE'VE PUT INTO THIS GENERAL SALE TODAY 
THE TOTAL COMES TO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY 
THAT IS GOOD 
BUT DON'T FORGET YOU HAVE ALL THOSE MILITARY ITEMS 
IT'LL BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT 
ANNE AND MALCOLM ARE LOOKING POSITIVE 
EVEN IF THEY'VE ONLY RAISED A FRACTION OF THE MONEY THEY NEED 
LET'S HOPE WE CAN PULL BACK FROM THE BRINK AT MALCOLM'S SPECIALIST MILITARY SALE 
A FEW DAYS AFTER THE GENERAL AUCTION DOWN IN SURREY IT'S LIFE 
AS USUAL FOR ANNE AND MALCOLM WHO HAVE HAD TIME TO MULL THINGS OVER 
THE GENERAL AUCTION WAS O. K. BUT I THINK WE WERE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FIGURES 
WE RAISED THREE HUNDRED SIXTY BUT WE HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH THE NEXT ONE POSSIBLY 
THAT IS PUTTING IT MILDLY BUT THE HORSE LOVERS ARE STILL DETERMINED 
TO GET SOMETHING FOR THEIR LIVERY YARD 
MALCOLM AND I HAVE UMMING AND AHING ABOUT WHAT TO DO 
WE HAVE BOTH COME TO THE SAME DECISION THAT WE'RE GOING 
TO GO FOR THE FRONT LOADER BECAUSE IT IS MORE IMPORTANT AT THIS STAGE 
THIS IS WHERE THE FRONT LOADING BUCKET IS GOING TO BE IDEAL FOR ME 
AS THE WIND COMES IN AND BLOWS THE SAND INTO HEAPS 
I HAVE TO LOAD IT INTO THE WHEELBARROW AND THEN 
LEVEL IT OUT INTO A LOW AREA 
WE ALWAYS HAVE WHEELBARROWS IN OUR HANDS MOVING HAY MOVING HORSE BEDDING 
PICKING UP HORSE POO BUT ONCE WE HAVE THE FRONT LOADER 
THE FRONT LOADER IS GOING TO BE FAR MORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE 
THE FIELD SHELTER MIGHT COME ANOTHER DAY BUT IT'S NOT A PRIORITY 
FINALLY DECISION MADE NOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT MODEL 
THERE THEY ALL ARE 
THERE IS THE ACTUAL ONE THERE OH YES NOW THAT 
THAT WOULD BE THE BUSINESS IT WOULD YES IT REALLY WOULD 
MALCOLM REALLY DOES WANT THIS 
THE FRONT LOADER HE IS GOING TO BE OVER THE MOON IF 
THE SPECIALIST AUCTION RAISES THE MONEY THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC 
WITH OVER TWO THOUSAND NEEDED TO HIT TARGET EVERYTHING RIDES ON THE SPECIALIST MILITARY SALE 
I HAVE COLLECTED MY MEDALS AND SWORDS FOR A LONG TIME 
YES I AM REASONABLY CONFIDENT 
I THINK WE COULD GET A GOOD RESULT 
A FEW DAYS LATER AND TRUE TO HIS WORD JONTY HAS TRAVELLED TO 
CAMBRIDGESHIRE TO GET THE LOW DOWN ON MALCOLM'S MILITARY MEMORABILIA 
HE HAS ALREADY DEPOSITED THE COLLECTION WITH MILITARY SPECIALIST AND AUCTIONEER TIM BLYTHE 
WHO'S DEVELOPED AN INTEREST IN MILITARIA AS A YOUTH 
IF ANYONE CAN SPOT WHETHER MALCOLM'S FRENCH RIFLE IS THE GENUINE ARTICLE OR NOT TIM CERTAINLY CAN 
HI TIM HI HOW ARE YOU HOW YOU DOING 
WHAT D'YOU THINK I'VE HAD A QUESTION MARK OVER THIS RIFLE 
I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF QUESTION MARKS I THINK IT'S A REPRODUCTION BUT IT HAS BEEN MADE 
WITH SOME ORIGINAL PARTS SO IT'S NOT ALL BAD NEWS 
WHAT ARE THE TELL TALE SIGNS WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE MOST OF ALL 
QUALITY OF THE WOOD ON THE STOCK 
WHICH ISN'T UP TO WHAT YOU'D EXPECT IT TO BE 
YES THAT WAS A MAJOR CONCERN OF MINE 
ALSO 
THE PATCH BOX ON HERE THAT LOOKS TOO SMALL FOR MY LIKING 
IT IS TOO SMALL YOU WOULDN'T NORMALLY FIND THAT ON A MILITARY MUSKET 
THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN EITHER 
THE WHOLE THING IS PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM INDIA IN THE SIXTIES 
WHAT SORT OF VALUE WOULD YOU PUT ON THAT 
I WOULD IMAGINE NOT VERY MUCH O. R. I. S. THERE STILL A MARKET FOR THIS 
FOR A SERIOUS COLLECTOR 
MAYBE NOT BUT IF YOU'RE FURNISHING A PUB OR AN OLD HOUSE 
AND YOU WANT SOMETHING FOR THE MANTELPIECE IT LOOKS THE PART 
WE'LL SEE WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTS OF THE COLLECTION THE SWORDS FOR INSTANCE 
THE SWORDS ARE VERY NICE WE'RE VERY IMPRESSED BY THOSE 
PARTICULARLY THIS ONE WHICH IS ACTUALLY LATE 
ZERO POINT ONE EIGHTH CENTURY 
VERY GOOD QUALITY 
THERE'S NO SIGNS OF RUST OR WEAR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
I COULD SEE THE SWORDS ON THEIR OWN GETTING UP TO SIX HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
MALCOLM IS GOING TO BE THRILLED 
GOOD THAT'S MUCH MORE THAN I THOUGHT 
WHAT ABOUT THE COLLECTION OF MEDALS THIS IS WONDERFUL YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH LOVE 
HAS GONE INTO PRESENTING THESE 
WE HAVE THE REGIMENTS THE GUYS' NUMBERS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING 
SERVICE HISTORY FROM THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHICH IS GREAT 
THIS PAIR PARTICULARLY THE STAR AND THE SUDAN MEDAL 
I CAN SEE THOSE GOING FOR PROBABLY TWO HUNDRED FOR THE PAIR GOOD FIND 
BRILLIANT THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU 
AND WE'RE STILL IN THE HISTORIC CATHEDRAL CITY IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE 
FOR ANNE AND MALCOLM'S SECOND SPECIALIST AUCTION 
IT HAS BEEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS SINCE WE MADE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY AT THE GENERAL SALE BUT REMEMBER WE ARE LOOKING TO MAKE 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SO IT IS ALL DOWN TO THE MILITARY SALE IN WHICH MALCOLM'S 
COLLECTION OF GUNS SWORDS AND MEDALS GOES UNDER THE HAMMER LET US SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
ANNE AND MALCOLM ARRIVE JUST IN TIME TO TAKE 
A GOOD LOOK AROUND THE AUCTION HOUSE WHERE THE SPECIALIST MILITARIA SALE TAKES PLACE 
JONTY WHO'S RIDING SOLO TODAY DOESN'T WASTE TIME IN TRACKING THEM BOTH DOWN 
IT'S THE DAY OF RECKONING ISN'T IT IT IS 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING 
THIS COLLECTION HAS TAKEN YOU YEARS TO GET TOGETHER AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE LITERALLY MINUTES TO SELL 
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR ONE ITEM THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE SAD TO SEE GO TODAY 
OR HAVE YOU NOW I'VE RESIGNED MYSELF THAT IT'S TIME TO LET GO 
HAVE YOU PUT ANY RESERVES ON ANYTHING 
I HAVE PUT THREE MODEST RESERVES ON THREE ITEMS WHICH ONES 
THE MUSKET THE FLINT LOCK AND ONE OF THE SWORDS 
WHAT ABOUT YOU ARE YOU HAPPY TO SEE THE COLLECTION GO 
I AM PERFECTLY HAPPY TO SEE THEM GO BECAUSE I NEVER UNDERSTOOD 
THE FASCINATION OF THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE 
IT WAS MALCOLM'S HOBBY AND INTEREST 
PLUS YOU HAD TO DUST THEM DUST THEM AND PUT THEM ON DISPLAY 
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME WE'VE GOT A REALLY TOUGH DAY TODAY 
IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE BECAUSE AT THE GENERAL SALE WE ONLY MADE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY 
WE HAVE A TARGET OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO AIM FOR THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON THIS 
ARE YOU READY TO DO BATTLE LITERALLY 
ABSOLUTELY FINGERS CROSSED 
WE HAVEN'T TOLD MALCOLM THE VALUES OF HIS MILITARY COLLECTION SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS IS A SPECIALIST AREA 
WHERE PRICES ARE DICTATED BY THE BIDDERS WHO ARE ALL EXPERTS IN THEIR MILITARY FIELDS 
SO WHAT DOES THE AUCTIONEER THINK 
WE'VE TAKEN A LOT OF PHONE ENQUIRIES ABOUT THEM 
THEY'RE VERY INTERESTING THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT OFF THE NORM 
I'M VERY HOPEFUL WE'RE GONNA GET A BIT OF ACTION IN THE ROOM ON THESE 
WE'RE UNDER STARTER'S ORDERS WITH THE FIRST OF MALCOLM'S 
OFFERINGS WITHIN OUR SIGHTS RIGHT THIS IS THE PISTOL 
LOT NINETY FIVE RATHER A NICE ONE LET'S HOPE THE SENTIMENTS ARE FELT IN THE ROOM 
AND THIS PISTOL GETS US OFF THE MARK IN OUR RACE TO GET CLOSER 
TO OUR TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TARGET 
AT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED TEN HERE IN THE ROOM AT TWO HUNDRED TEN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY 
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY IT'S STILL HERE GOES THEN AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY 
AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE ROOM ARE YOU ALL DONE 
TWO HUNDRED FORTY 
AT TWO HUNDRED FORTY NOW NEW MONEY AT TWO HUNDRED FORTY 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BACK HERE AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
FINISHED AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
WELL DONE YEAH FINE 
THAT'S GOOD MALCOLM DOESN'T LOOK TOO CONVINCED 
MAYBE HIS NERVES ARE KICKING IN 
IT'S A FANTASTIC START WITH HIS FLINT LOCK PISTOL GOING WELL OVER ITS ESTIMATE 
LOT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE IS THE PERCUSSION MUSKET 
YOU PUT A RESERVE ON THIS ONE YES I HAVE ALL RIGHT SO ARE YOU TAKING IT BACK OR NOT 
WE'LL SEE 
MALCOLM'S FRENCH RIFLE TURNED OUT NOT TO BE THE REAL DEAL 
THAT HASN'T STOPPED HIM TAKING A GAMBLE AND PUTTING A RESERVE OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY WHICH IS ABOVE ESTIMATE 
ONE HUNDRED I'VE GOT AT ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED TEN 
AT ONE HUNDRED TEN ONLY 
DONE THEN AT ONE HUNDRED TEN 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY I MIGHT BE TAKING IT HOME 
ONE HUNDRED NINETY AT ONE HUNDRED NINETY IS THAT IT YOU ARE ALL DONE 
AT ONE HUNDRED NINETY FINISHED AND DONE AT ONE HUNDRED NINETY 
HE TOOK IT UP TO ONE HUNDRED NINETY THAT MEANS THERE WASN'T A BID IN THE ROOM AT ONE HUNDRED NINETY 
THE UNDER BIDDER WOULD'VE BEEN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
SO PUTTING A ONE HUNDRED NINETY RESERVE DID BACKFIRE AS THE RIFLE'S GONE UNSOLD 
MALCOLM COULD BE SAYING GOODBYE TO THAT TRACTOR FRONT LOADER 
JONTY ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED MALCOLM'S HANDSOME COLLECTION OF SWORDS AT AROUND ONE HUNDRED 
BUT OUR MILITARY SPECIALIST STUNNED JONTY WHEN HE VALUED THEM AT THREE TIMES AS MUCH 
REMEMBER MALCOLM'S IN THE DARK OVER THIS 
THEY'RE NOW BEING SOLD INDIVIDUALLY SO COULD HE BE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE 
O. K. THIS IS THE ONE WE HAVE BIG INTEREST IN 
LOT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX PAN LIGHT CAVALRY SWORD THIS IS SERIOUSLY COOL 
WHAT RESERVE DID YOU PUT ON THAT 
I CAN'T REMEMBER NOW 
A COUPLE OF HUNDRED QUID ON BID TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HUNDRED FORTY 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED NINETY 
THREE HUNDRED AT THREE HUNDRED NOW THIS SIDE AT THREE HUNDRED 
AT THREE HUNDRED ONLY IT GOES THEN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY 
THIS IS A GOOD SWORD 
AT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SEATED IN THE ROOM AT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY IS THAT IT AT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY 
I'M CONVINCED THAT THAT WAS USED AT WATERLOO 
WE BELIEVE YOU MALCOLM AND THAT WAS A FANTASTIC RESULT AT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY 
THE REST OF MALCOLM'S NINETEENTH CENTURY SWORDS PROVIDE REINFORCEMENTS FOR THE TROOPS 
WHEN THEY COME UNDER THE HAMMER FINISHED AND DONE AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY 
AT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ANYBODY ELSE 
THEY WIN THE BATTLE TO AMASS A TOTAL OF EIGHT HUNDRED TEN 
WELL DONE THEY'VE GONE NOW YEP AW AW 
I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE RESULT ON THAT VERY PLEASED 
IT WAS IT WAS GOOD IT WAS GOOD 
WHAT A DIFFERENCE A SPECIALIST AUCTION MAKES 
MALCOLM'S MILITARY COLLECTION IS STORMING THE ROOM HERE AT BLYTHE'S 
SO MUCH SO THAT IT FINALLY LOOKS LIKE THAT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TARGET COULD BE WITHIN REACH 
WE FINALLY GET TO MALCOLM'S MEDALS THAT HE'S LOVINGLY COLLECTED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS 
THEY'RE ALSO ALL GOING TO BE AUCTIONED OFF SEPARATELY 
ANNE HAVE YOU EVER REALLY STUDIED THESE MEDALS OR WAS IT ALWAYS MALCOLM'S DOMAIN 
ALWAYS MALCOLM'S DOMAIN BUT HE CAN TALK FOR HOURS ON IT OVER COUNTLESS NUMBERS OF EVENING MEALS 
ONCE YOU 
PRESS THE RIGHT BUTTON ON MALCOLM HE WILL TALK FOR HOURS ON THE SUBJECT 
SO LET'S HOPE FOR ANNE'S SAKE AND SANITY THEY ALL GET SNAPPED UP 
THIS NEXT MEDAL ISSUED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE IS FROM THE CRIMEAN CAMPAIGN

HIS SACRIFICE WILL BE WORTH IT 
LOT THIRTY FOUR THE VICTORY MEDAL WORLD WAR ONE 
LOT FORTY EIGHT ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED TEN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY 
THAT'S A HEROIC RESULT AND SO FAR 
THESE MEDALS ALONE HAVE MADE OVER ONE THOUSAND

THIS IS THE EGYPT MEDALS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST 
IT'LL BE FASCINATING TO SEE WHERE THE HAMMER FALLS 
LOT SEVENTY EIGHT IS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY NORTH AFRICA PAIR OF MEDALS

HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW GOOD 
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO PAY THAT MUCH BUT I WAS PLEASED TO ACTUALLY GET THEM 
BECAUSE I COLLECT THAT EXACT MEDAL TO THEM 
SO THERE'S THE ROLL OF SEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN MEN 
I HAVE NOW TWENTY EIGHT OF THEM 
SO THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T STOP 
AND WE'RE JUST GLAD THIS BIDDER TURNED UP FOR ALL THOSE MEN 
AND HIS CONTRIBUTION BRINGS OUR MEDALS TOTAL TO ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIX 
WAY OVER ESTIMATE 
WITH THAT BUMPER RESULT IT LOOKS LIKE MALCOLM'S TRACTOR FRONT LOADER 
COULD BE WINGING ITS WAY TO THE FARM

YOU PULL THIS LEVER LIKE THIS TO RAISE IT UP 
IF I TURN IT TO THE RIGHT WATCH WHAT THE BUCKET DOES 
TIPS OUT RIGHT 
IT'S BRILLIANT IT'S GONNA SAVE ME A LOT OF TIME A LOT OF EFFORT SO CAN LIFE GET ANY SWEETER
