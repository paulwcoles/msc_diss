THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE 
IS VISITING THE CAPITAL THIS WEEK 
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON TRACK TO HOST 
THE GAMES SINCE THEY LAST CHECKED 
THERE'S OPINION A FEW CHANGES IN 
LONDON NAMELY A NEW MAYOR AND A 
NEW APPROACH 
THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN 
SCATHING ABOUT THE RISING COST OF 
THE LONDON OLYMPICS SO NOW THAT WE 
HAVE A TORY MAYOR CAN WE EXPECT 
STRONGER ASSURANCES THAT THE 
BUDGET'S UNDER CONTROL BORIS 
JOHNSON'S ALWAYS PLEDGED ANY EXTRA 
COSTS WILL NOT BE PICKED UP BY 
LONDON COUNCIL TAX PAYERS WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN SOME PROPER 
FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THE BUDGET DOESN'T RUN OUT OF 
CONTROL 
THIS WEEKEND THERE'S BEEN CONTROL FURTHER CLAIMS THAT THE BUDGET IS 
STILL SPIRALLING WITH OFFICIALS 
FROM THE OLYMPIC DELIVERY AUTHORITY 
ACCEPTING THAT THE COST OF THE 
AQUATIC CENTRE HAS MORE THAN 
TREBLED FROM SEVENTY THREE MILLION TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO 
MILLION MILLION THE CONSEQUENCE HAVING TO DELIVER 
THE BASKETBALL HANDBALL 
PARALYMPIC SPORT AND HOCKEY VENUES 
ON A BUDGET WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED TO 
BE UNREALISTIC THOUGH THE ODA SAID 
IT'S CONFIDENT IT'S ACHIEVABLE IT 
HASN'T RULED OUT OUT DIPPING INTO 
THE CONTINGENCY FUND IF NECESSARY 
NOT SURPRISINGLY THE NEW SPORTS 
COMMISSIONER HAS TODAY EMPHASISED 
THE NEED FOR FINANCIAL HONESTY THE THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT LONDONERS 
WHO ARE ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE 
INVOLVED IN THE GREAT SPECTACLE 
KNOW THAT WE'RE AS TRANSPARENT AS 
POSSIBLE AND NO ONE WILL BE SAYING 
STOP THE GAMES 
KATE HOEY'S 
APPOINTMENT AS NEW ADVISER SIGNALS 
ANOTHER CHANGE IN EMPHASIS TOWARDS 
GREATER PARTICIPATION IN SPORT 
SOMETHING THE MAYOR HOPES WILL 
IMPRESS THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC 
COMMITTEE WHEN IT ARRIVES IN LONDON 
NEXT WEEK MR. JOHNSON'S BEEN 
CALLING FOR THE LAW TO BE CHANGED 
SO THAT THE ROLE OF MAYOR OF LONDON 
CAN ONLY LAST FOR TWO TERMS HE'S 
WRITTEN TO THE SECRETARY FOR LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT HAZEL BLEARS SAYING 
WITHOUT A LIMIT ON HOW LONG A MAYOR 
CAN SERVE THERE'S A DANGER OF 
CRONYISM AND CORRUPTION AT CITY
