HELLO I AM JEREMY VINE AND THIS IS 
PANORAMA THE NUMBER OF WORKERS ON 
THE SICK HAS TREBLED IN THE LAST THIRTY 
YEAR AT A COST TO YOU THE TAXPAYER 
OF SIXTEEN BILLION A YEAR 
WHEN DID YOU 
LAST HAVE A JOB 
IT WAS A LONG TIME 
AGO LET ME THINK 
BUT ARE THEY 
ALL REALLY TOO ILL TO WORK I I PROBABLY WAS RATHER A SOFT TOUCH 
BECAUSE I HAVE OVER EVER WORKED IN 
THIS COMMUNITY 
NOW THE GOVERNMENT 
IS CRACKING DOWN WITH TOUGH NEW 
RULES TO SEPARATE THE SICK FROM THE 
SKIVERS 
I AM TOO SICK TO WORK L. AM SKIVERS TOO SICK TO GO TO WORK 
A MILLION PEOPLE OFF THE SICK BY 
THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT IS AN AMBITIOUS 
TARGET THAT LOOKS GREAT ON PAPER 
BUT CAN IT BE DONE WILL IT CREATE 
A LOAD MORE NEW PROBLEMS AND WHERE 
WITH ALL THE JOBS COME FROM THEN 
AGAIN CAN BRITAIN REALLY AFFORD TO 
GO ON PAYING AS MUCH EVERY YEAR AS 
IT IS COSTING TO STAGE THE OLYMPICS 
TO THOSE ON THE SICK WHO COULD 
REALLY BE EARNING LIVING ONE IN 
FIFTEEN OF THE ADULT POPULATION CLAIMING 
INCAPACITY BENEFIT THAT IS MAD AS AS MANY AS TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE 
RECEIVING INCAPACITY BENEFIT MAY 
NOT BE ENTITLED TO IT 
THE START OF 
ANOTHER DAY AND MOST OF MERTHYR 
TYDFIL IS OFF TO WORK BUT I AM 
COMING TO FIND OUT WHY NEARLY ONE 
IN FIVE PEOPLE LIVING HERE IS STUCK 
ON THE SOFA APPARENTLY TOO ILL TO 
TAKE A JOB IF THE GOVERNMENT'S 
SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING ONE MILLION 
OFF THE SICK THEN IT HAS TO WORK 
OUT HOW TO SOLVE A PROBLEM LIKE 
MERTHYR BEFORE BREAKFAST TREVOR 
PRICE DOWNS A COCKTAIL OF PILLS HE 
WAS ORMLY SIGNED OFF WITH BACK PAIN 
BG BUT OVER THE YEARS HE HAS 
DEVELOPED ANGINA ARTHRITIS BLOOD 
CLOTS AND DEPRESSION HIS 
GRANDDAUGHTER JENNA HAS NEVER KNOWN 
HIM TO WORK WHEN TREVOR FIRST WENT 
OFF SICK FROM HIS JOB AS A TYRE 
FITTER TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO JENNA'S MUM HAS 
JUST STARTED SCHOOL 
I CAN'T LOOK 
FOR WORK IT IS NO GOOD ME LOOKING 
FOR WORK IF I DIDN'T CAN'T DO IT 
WE WILL SURVIVE WE ALWAYS DO NEW NEW LABOUR HAD TREVOR IN ITS SIGHTS 
WHEN IT ANNOUNCED A CRACKDOWN ON 
INCAPACITY BENEFIT TEN YEARS AGO 
YOUR TEA IS READY 
PANORAMA FILMED 
WITH HIM BACK THEN HE HAS JUST 
HEARD HIS BENEFIT CLAIM HAS BEEN 
REJECTED FOR THE THIRD YEAR RUNNING 
EACH TIME A GOVERNMENT MEDICAL HAD 
FOUND HIM FIT FOR WORK BUT THREE 
TIMES HE APPEAL AND WON HE HOPED 
THAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT I I CONTINUE CAN'T WORK THAT IS THE 
END OF STORY LEAVE ME ALONE SO I 
CAN GET ON WITH MY LIFE 
AND HE HAS 
HAD HIS WISH FOR A DECADE NON HAS 
BOTHERED HIM BUT WILL IT STAY THAT 
WAY IT IS A STRUGGLE FOR THE WHOLE 
FAMILY HIS WIFE CARES FOR HIM TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS 
IF YOU ARE HONEST IT MUST HAVE BEEN 
FRUSTRATING FOR YOU AT TIMES OVER 
THE YEARS THAT YOUR HUSBAND WASN'T 
WORKING 
YES I WAS FRUSTRATED WORKING WATCHING THE STATE HE GETS IN 
BECAUSE HE CAN'T DO THINGS THINGS 
HE WOULD LIKE TO DO FOR US BUT HE 
CAN'T HE GIST CAN'T AND THAT DOES 
GET HIM DOWN JUST 
DOWN THE 
VALLEY ONE COUPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH 
OF LIFE ON THE SICK WHEN DID YOU 
LAST HAVE A JOB

TIME AGO LET ME THINK NOW NINETEEN

TWENTY YEARS OUT OF WORK THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT LAST SIX OF THEM ON THE SICK WITH 
DEPRESSION

THEIR SON 
WHAT IS HE GOING TO LOOK 
AT A MOTHER AND FATHER ON BENEFITS 
IS HE GOING TO GO ON BENEFITS AS 
WELL WE ARE NOT SHOWING HIM ARE 
WE WE ARE NOT GIVING HIM A GREAT 
EXAMPLE ARE WE NO 
CAN THEY BREAK NO THE CYCLE WE WILL FIND OUT THIS 
IS PETER AND RITA WILLIAMS HOME 
SINCE BEING EVICTED FROM THEIR 
COUNCIL HOUSE 
HAVE BEEN ON AND OFF 
THE SICK FORURE YEARS L. WAS ON IT 
FOR GASTRIC ULCERS AND ARTHRITIS L. 
PASSED OUT ONE DAY IN TOWN WHEN 
THEY SAID I SUFFERED AN ANGINA 
ATTACK L. 
HAD A BAD CAR CRASH L. HAD INTERNAL INJURY THEY SAID I 
WASN'T GOING TO PULL THROUGH RITA RITA HAS BEEN ON THE SICK WITH ARTHRITIS 
NEITHER HAS EVER HAD A JOB BUT 
THEY ARE ABOUT TO GET A RUDE 
AWAKENING 
I AM NOT SAYING I AM AWAKENING SEVERELY DISABLED IN ANY WAY L. AM 
SAYING I DON'T THINK I AM FIT 
ENOUGH TO WORK AT THE MOMENT L. CAN 
MOVE MY HANDS LEGS I CAN TALK AND 
THERE IS THINGS I CAN DO BUT THERE 
IS THINGS 
I CAN'T I AM OF THE 
SCHOOL OF THOUGHT IF YOU CAN PRESS 
A BUTTON YOU CAN WORK 
ANDREW HAS 
LIVED IN MERTHYR ALL HIS LIFE AND 
HAS WORKED HARD TO BUILD UP HIS OWN 
SMALL BUSINESS HE IS FRUSTRATED BY 
THE TOWN'S REPUTATION 
IT IS ALMOST 
A CAREER CHOICE TO CLAIM INCAPACITY 
BENEFIT YOU DON'T THINK THERE IS 
AN INCENTIVE TO GET OFF IT THERE 
IS EVERY INCENTIVE FOR EVERYBODY 
WORKING TO GO ON TO IT NEARLY NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CLAIMANTS ARE UNDER FIVE NINETEEN 
YEAR OLD LISA MARIE COULD BE ABOUT 
TO JOIN THEM A SINGLE MUM WHO 
HASN'T WORKED SINCE LEAVING SCHOOL 
SHE HAS GOT POSTNATAL DEPRESSION 
SOMETIMES I DO GET DEPRESSED AND 
COME DOWN LIKE A TONNE OF BRICK 
OTHER TIMES I AM ON TOP OF THE 
WORLD 
DO YOU WORRY THE LONGER IT WORLD IS THAT YOU HAVE NEVER HAD A JOB 
THAT THE HARDER IT MIGHT BE TO GET 
ONE 
YES I DO FIND IT DIFFICULT ONE BECAUSE I HAVE LEARNING 
DIFFICULTIES SO THAT PUTS ME DOWN 
A BIT 
SHE RECENTLY HAD AN 
INCAPACITY BENEFIT MEDICAL IS STILL 
WAITING TO HEAR WHETHER THEY THINK 
SHE IS FIT FOR WORK HER G. P. KNOWS 
MERTHYR WELL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL 
HEALTH HERE IS MUCH POORER THAN 
AVERAGE DOCTOR RICHARDS KNOWS WHOLE 
FAMILIES WHO ARE ON THE SICK WHICH 
DOESN'T HELP THE TOWN'S IMAGE THE THE COMMUNITY HERE HAS A BAD REPUTATION 
AND I HAVE SPOKEN TO SMALL 
BUSINESSMEN AND EMPLOYERS WHO KNOW 
ABOUT THE REPUTATION OF THE 
COMMUNITY AND THEY WOULD SAY WELL 
PEOPLE FROM MERTHYR WILL GO ON THE 
SICK AT THE DELOP OF A HAT IF I 
HAD A CHOICE OF SOMEONE FROM 
MERTHYR TYDFIL AND ANOTHER 
COMMUNITY I WOULD RATHER EMPLOY 
THEM 
BUT JUST A FEW DEN THEM GENERATIONS AGO IT HAD A DIFFERENT 
REPUTATION IT WAS AN AFFLUENT TOWN 
WITH A PROUD WORKING TRADITION THE 
COAL MINES AN HEAVY INDUSTRY 
OFFERED DECENT SECURE JOBS TO ALL 
WHO WANTED THEM AND BUT WHEN IT 
ALL SHUT DOWN MEN WHO HAD 
PREVIOUSLY WORKED WITH BAD BACKS 
AND CHEST PROBLEMS SUDDENLY FOUND 
THEMSELVES UNEMPLOYED AND ELIGIBLE 
FOR INCAPACITY BENEFIT L. PAID MORE 
THAN THE DOLE AND THERE WAS NO 
REQUIREMENT TO LOOK FOR WORK WITH 
SOARING UNEMPLOYMENT THIS SUITED 
THE GOVERNMENT AT THE TIME AS IT 
KEPT THEM OFF THE OFFICIAL JOBLESS 
FIGURES ANDREW BAR I I BARRY 
WAS PART OF THAT PROCESS WHEN HE 
WORKED FOR EMPLOYMENT SERVICE HE 
ADVISED DOZENS OF MINERS TO GO ON 
THE SICK 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE 
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WE SIGNED ON TO 
INCAPACITY BENEFIT WE WERE TOLD BY 
THE MANAGERS AT THE TIME IN A 
FRIENDLY WAY LOOK YOU SHOULDN'T 
BE TELLING THEM THIS WHAT YOU NEED 
TO TELL THEM IS INCAPACITY BENEFIT 
IS THE ONE FOR THEM SO WE SIGNED 
THEM ON THE THAT BECAUSE WE WERE 
THEIR FRIENDS YOU KNOW RUN BISHOP 
ABSOLUTE ROT RUBBISH L. REGRET 
IT OF COURSE I REGRET IT THOSE THOSE GOOD INTENTIONS LEFT MANY TRAPPED 
IN A ECONOMIC HOUSE ARREST ONCE ON 
THE BENEFIT FOR TWELVE MONTHIOUS ARE 
LIKELY TO STAY ON IT FOR EIGHT 
YEARS AND IT IS NOT JUST A LEGACY 
FROM HEAVY INDUSTRY EVERY YEAR 
ANOTHER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE GO ON THE 
SICK THE BIGGEST REASON MENTAL 
HEALTH PROBLEMS LIKE DEPRESSION OR 
STRESS THEY ARE COSTING THE 
TAXPAYER SIXTEEN BILLION A YEAR 
RADICAL ADVICE TO THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS LED TO A RETHINK FROM OCTOBER 
ALL NEW CLAIMANTS WILL FACE A 
TOUGHER MEDICAL AND ALL BUT THE 
MOST SEVERELY DISABLED WILL HAVE TO 
PREPARE FOR SOME KIND OF WORK TO 
QUALIFY FOR A RENAMED BENEFIT THE THE EMPLOYMENT AND SUPPORT ALLOWANCE IS 
AER VERY DIFFERENT BENEFIT FROM 
INCAPACITY BENEFIT AND THAT WILL BE 
A IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH BECAUSE 
WHAT THAT DOES IS TO LOOK AT WHAT 
PEOPLE CAN DO INSTEAD OF FOCUSING 
ON WHAT THEY CAN'T WHAT WE 
RECOGNISE NOW IS THAT MANY PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE HAD HEALTH PROBLEMS WILL 
BE BETTER OFF IN HEALTH TERM IN 
WORK AS WELL AS BETTER OFF 
FINANCIALLY 
THE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCIALLY THINKING ON THIS HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY 
MANSELL AYLWARD HE WAS ONCE A 
LOCAL G. P. MORE RECENTLY HE WAS 
CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISER AT THE 
DEPARTMENT FOR WORK AND PENSIONS 
WHERE HE BEGAN RESEARCHING WHY SOME 
PEOPLE WITH COMMON HEALTH PROBLEMS 
DON'T RETURN TO WORK AS QUICKLY AS 
OTHERS 
THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT PEOPLE OTHERS WHO ARE DELIBERATELY FEIGNING 
ILLNESS JUST TO GET BENEFIT THEY 
ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK BUT IT IS 
CLEAR EVEN IF ONE MANAGED TO TREAT 
THE ACTUAL MEDICAL ISSUE VERY 
QUICKLY AFTER ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN 
WEEKS THEN IT WAS THE BELIEFS 
ATTITUDES SOCIETY ISSUES THAT 
AFFECTED THEM MORE THAN MERE 
MERELY THE MEDICAL PROBLEM THEY 
STARTED OFF WITH 
HE RECKONS AS 
MANY AS SEVENTY PER CENT OF INCAPACITY BENEFIT 
CLAIMANTS COULD WORK WITH SUPPORT 
IT IS NOT JUST ILLNESS THAT STOPS 
THEM THOUGH NEW RESEARCH HAS 
SURVEYED IN DETAIL OVER THREE THOUSAND 
CLAIMANTS AND IT HAS FOUND WHILE A 
MINORITY WANT TO WORK MANY FEAR 
THEY WILL LOSE OUT THAT IT 
WOULDN'T PAY AS MUCH AS THE PACKAGE 
OF BENEFITS THEY GET ON THE SICK 
FOR THOSE WHO SAY TO US THEY WOULD 
LIKE A JOB ONE OF THE STRIKING 
THINGS IS THAT QUITE A HIGH 
PROPORTION IT IS ABOUT THIRD OF 
MEN AND ONE IN SIX WOMEN ARE SAYING 
THEY WOULD NEED AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED 
WEEK AFTER TAX TO MAKE IT 
WORTHWHILE COMING OFF BENEFIT AND 
GOING INTO WORK 
THAT IS ROUND 
TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR UNREALISTIC PERHAPS 
BUT IT IS AN EXPECTATION THAT THE 
PROFESSOR THINKS HAS TO BE TACKLED 
WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD GO TO 
WORK FOR LESS MONEY THAN YOU CAN 
GET FOR BEING OUT OF WORK VERY FEW 
PEOPLE WOULD DO THAT L. FELT VERY 
STRONGLY FOR VERY LONG TIME THAT 
WE HAD TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO 
RETURN TO WORK BY GIVING THEM MORE 
MONEY WHEN THEY WERE WORKING AND AND SO PATHWAYS TO WORK WAS BORN IT 
PROVIDES LONG TERM INCAPACITY 
CLAIMANTS LIKE CALVIN WHO WANT TO 
GO BACK TO WORK WITH A PERSONAL 
ADVISER TO GIVE WHATEVER HELP IS 
NEEDED THERE IS A BIT OF STICK AND 
JUICY CARROTS LIKE AN EXTRA TWO THOUSAND 
IF THEY STAY IN THE JOB FOR THE 
FIRST YEAR 
I THOUGHT IS YOU 
POSSIBLY WORKING THIRTY HOURS PLUS AS A 
WAGE OF SIX AN HOUR 
TODAY CALVIN 
AND KAREN ARE FINDING OUT WHAT 
WORKING WOULD MEAN FOR THEM 
FINANCIALLY PATHWAYS HAS ONLY JUST 
BEEN ROLLED OUT HERE BUT A WELSH 
FORERUN TORE THE SCHEME WANT TWO WORK 
HAS PAID FOR CALVIN TO QUALIFY AS A 
SECURITY GUARD AND IS FUNDING 
KAREN'S TRAINING AS A CARE 
ASSISTANT 
SO I HAVE YOU DONE AS ASSISTANT RECEIVING INCOME SUPPORT HOUSE 
BENEFIT COUNCIL TAX BENEFIT CHILD 
BENEFIT 
THEY HAVE TO FACTOR IN BENEFIT LOSING MOST OF THOSE BENEFITS PLUS 
PAYING OUT FOR CHILDCARE BUT THEY 
WILL GET TAX CREDIT FORICAL V. I. P. 
BEING OVER FIFTY AND THE BABY BEING 
UNDER A YEAR SO WILL IT BE WORTH 
IT 
IN COMPARISON YOU WOULD BE IT BETTER OFF BY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY A WEEK 
A WEEK 
YES 
IT RISES TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY A WEEK WHEN YES YOU ADD IN THE RETURN TO WORK 
CREDIT BUT IT WILL REQUIRE SOME 
RADICAL CHANGES MERTHYR IS A PLACE 
WHERE FAMILIES TEND TO LOOK AFTER 
THEIR OWN THERE IS A DISTRUST OF 
FORMAL CHILDCARE BUT KAREN HAS NO 
CHOICE 
COME ON THEN LET'S GO SHE CHOICE SHE IS STARTING HER TRAINING COURSE SO 
SHE HAS TO LEAVE TEN MONTH OLD 
KEANE AT THE LOCAL NURSERY IT IS 
THE FIRST TIME HE HAS BEEN AWAY 
FROM MUM FOR WHOLE DAY 
I THOUGHT KAREN WOULD BE BRAVE BUT 
SHE IS NOT 
IT IS A HARD THING TO 
DO THOUGH 
IT IS 
DO YOU THINK IT 
IS WORTH IT 
YES BECAUSE KAREN 
WANTS TO GO BACK TO WORK SEE L. 
CAN'T WATCH HIM HE'S TOO YOUNG AT 
THE MOMENT HE'S IN A GOOD PLACE 
HE IS HOPEFUL HE'LL HAVE A JOB SOON 
PATHWAYS TO WORK HAS STRUGGLED TO 
HELP CLAIMANTS LIKE HIM UNLESS 
THAT CHANGES THE GOVERNMENT WILL 
NOT HIT ITS ONE MILLION TARGET YOU YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE WILL ONLY 
BE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE TARGET THAT 
WE HAVE SET IF WE ARE ABLE TO HELP 
MANY PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH 
PROBLEMS INTO WORK AND PEOPLE L. 
WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS 
PARTICULARLY STAND TO BENEFIT FROM 
BEING IN A JOB IT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT THAT PATH WAYS IS ABLE TO 
HELP THEM IT WILL THE EVIDENCE IS 
STARTING TO EMERGE IT IS DOING NO 
DOUBT WE NEED TO MAKE FURTHER 
CHANGES TO MAXIMISE THE BENEFITS 
MANSEL AYLWARD'S RESEARCH SUGGESTS 
THAT WORK IS GENERALLY GOOD FOR 
HEALTH SO WE BROUGHT HIM TO MEET 
TREVOR WHO YOU WILL REMEMBER HAS 
BEEN LEFT ALONE BY THE SYSTEM FOR 
THE PAST TEN YEARS CAN THE 
PROFESSOR PERSUADE HIM OFF THE SOFA 
YOU HAVE A PAIN IN YOUR BACK YOU 
CANNOT BEND TO PUT YOUR SOCKS ON 
YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO GIVE YOU A 
HAND IT GETS YOU DOWN 
YOU DON'T 
SEEM TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN 
RETURNING TO WORK ANY WAY 
I DON'T 
SEE IT IT IS NOT CONFIDENCE IT IS 
NOW I KNOW I CANNOT DO IT AND IT 
GETS ME YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAID IF 
IT WAS BACK TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO MAYBE 
I COULD HAVE GONE THEN BUT I WOULD 
BE TOO AFRAID NOW 
WOULD YOU GO OUT 
TO MEET UP WITH PEOPLE 
NO JUST 
LEAVE ME ALONE THAT'S ALL LEAVE 
ME ALONE I'M HAPPY ENOUGH 
TREVOR'S STORY IS SO TYPICAL OF THE 
OBSTACLES TO WORK THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
AND DO EXHIBIT IN THIS AREA THE 
POINT IS THIS CHAP NOW HE IS FIFTY EIGHT 
HE'S PO GOT PERHAPS TWENTY YEARS AHEAD 
OF HIM THERE ARE STILL THINGS WE 
COULD DO TO HELP HIM RETURN TO A 
BETTER FUNCTIONING BETTER LIFE 
EVEN RETURN TO WORK 
A WORK THAT 
WOULD SUIT HIM LET'S BE HONEST 
THE WAY TREVOR IS NOW HE WOULD NOT 
BE A CANDIDATE FOR WORK FOR ANY 
EMPLOYER EMPLOYER THE GOVERNMENT THINKS THE ROT SETS 
IN WITH G. P.'S WHO SIGN PATIENTS OFF 
FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS BEFORE 
THEY ARE SENT FOR FULL MEDICAL ASSESSMENT ASSESSMENT TREVOR PRICE PLEASE 
WHEN WE LAST 
FILMED WITH TREVOR HIS G. P. WAS OF 
THE OPINION HE WAS TOO ILL TO WORK 
HE DOES HAVE SOME REJECTS 
WHEN I 
LOOK BACK ON WHAT I USED TO DO TEN 
YEARS AGO I WAS RATHER A SOFT 
TOUCH L. HAVE ONLY EVER WORKED IN 
THIS COMMUNITY L. L. HAVE NOT BEEN 
AWARE OF SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVES 
THAT WERE AVAILABLE L. AM MUCH MORE 
POSITIVE IN TERMS OF SAYING TO 
PEOPLE WHEN THEY COME FOR THE FIRST 
TIME WE NEED TO BE PLANNING NOW 
FOR YOUR RETURN TO WORK 
FROM NEXT 
YEAR THE GOVERNMENT WILL ASK G. P.'S TO 
WRITE WELL NOTES WHICH KNOW KUS ON 
WHAT PATIENTS CAN DO RATHER THAN 
WHAT THEY CAN'T G. P.'S WORRY ABOUT 
THE EFFECT IT WILL HAVE ON THEIR 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH PATIENTS 
IF I 
TOOK A HARD LINE AND SAW MY DUTY 
WAS TO MINIMISE THE COST TO THE 
WIDER COMMUNITY THEN I COULD SIGN 
SOME PEOPLE AND SAY THERE MUST BE 
SOME WORK YOU COULD DO IT IS NOT 
MY PROBLEM THAT WORK IS NOT 
AVAILABLE OR NOT MY PROBLEM IF 
YOUR EMPLOYER WILL NOT PROVIDE IT 
FOR YOU HERE YOU ARE YOU HAVE TO 
GO OUT TO WORK L. DON'T THINK THAT 
IS MY ROLE 
I DON'T THINK IT IS MY ROLE 
GETTING JOB BECOMES HARDER WHEN 
YOU HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED AS LONG AS 
CALVIN AND KAREN IT HAS TAKEN 
SEVEN MONTHS JUST TO GET THEM THE 
SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE TO APPLY FOR 
WORK AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OF 
A JOB ALTHOUGH CALVIN PASSED HIS 
SECURITY TRAINING SIX WEEKS ON HE 
IS STILL WAITING FOR HIS LICENSE TO 
COME THROUGH 
I HAVE TO HANG IN 
THERE AND JUST WAIT L. THINK KAREN 
GOT A JOB BEFORE ME SO TO BE 
PATIENT 
HOW WILL YOU FEEL IF THAT PATIENT IS WHAPTS 
IT IS FRUST WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IT IS FRUSTRATING I AM HAPPENS THE MAN OF THE HOUSE I SHOULD BE 
WORKING L. WILL DO THE HOUSE WORK 
WHILE I AM WAITING KAREN'S KAREN'S TRAINING COURSE COMES WITH A 
GUARANTEEED INTERVIEW SHE HAS BEEN 
GIVEN EIGHTY TO SPEND ON CLOTHES FOR 
THE BIG DAY SO YOU ARE LOOKING 
GREAT YOU HAVE THE CLOTHES ON THAT 
THEY HELPED YOU BUY HOW ARE YOU 
FEELING ABOUT THE INTERVIEW VERY VERY NERVOUS BUT I SHOULD BE O. K. ONCE I 
AM UP THERE AND HOPEFULLY ANSWER 
ALL THE QUESTIONS AND THEN DO WELL 
AND GET THIS JOB 
BUT IF SHE DOES 
AND CALVIN IS STILL NOT IN WORK 
THE FAMILY WILL NOT BE AS WELL OFF 
AS THEY HAD HOPED HAD YOU THOUGHT 
IN THE MEAN TIME ABOUT LOOKING FOR 
OTHER WORK WHILE YOU ARE WAITING 
FOR THE BADGE 
NO L. PASSED MY 
EXAMS IT IS JUST WAITING L. HAVE 
DONE THE COURSE SO NOW I AM INTO 
SECURITY 
EXPECTATIONS ARE HIGH A SECURITY THIRD OF EMPLOYERS SURVEYED 
NATIONALLY SAID THEY DELIBERATELY 
EXCLUDE THE LONG TERM ILL WHEN 
RECRUITING STAFF CAN NEW JOBS BE 
FOUND FOR EVERYONE THE GOVERNMENT 
WANTS TO GET OFF THE SICK 
ESPECIALLY WHERE INCAPACITY 
BENEFITS ARE HIGHEST THE 
UNEMPLOYMENT 
IS THE HIGHEST THIS THIS IS THE OLD INDUSTRIAL BRITAIN 
IN MERTHYR TYDFIL WHERE NEARLY 
SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE ON THE SICK HOW 
MANY WOULD THE GOVERNMENT HAVE TO 
GET OFF IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ITS 
TARGET 
VERY ROUGHLY IN MERTHYR I TARGET WOULD SAY THREE THOUSAND NEED TO COME OFF 
THE FIGURES 
THAT IS JUST MERTHYR 
ACROSS THE SOUTH WALES VALLEYS YOU 
ARE LOOKING AT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW JOBS IN 
GLASGOW THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND NEW JOBS WOULD BE 
REQUIRED JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE 
CURRENTLY ON THE SICK NEVER MIND 
THE UNEMPLOYED AN AMBITIOUS TARGET 
IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE WE WE CERTAINLY NEED MORE JOBS WE'VE GOT 
A LOT MORE JOBS IN THE U. K. NOW THAN 
WE HAD TEN YEARS AGO WE HAVE MORE 
JOBS MORE PEOPLE IN WORK THAN EVER 
BEFORE 
IT IS NOT A PROBLEM EVENLY BEFORE SPREAD THERE ARE POCKETS WHERE 
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE 
SICK AND UNEMPLOYED AND NOT SO MANY 
JOBS 
YES BUT IN EVERY REGION JOBS THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT 
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF JOBS WE 
ARE SEEING NEW JOBS CREATED IN 
MERTHYR NEW RETAIL JOBS T. MOBILE 
OVER THE ROAD THERE ARE JOB 
OPPORTUNITIES WE CERTAINLY NEED TO 
SEE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS CONTINUING 
WE'VE BROUGHT PROFESSOR AYLWARD TO 
MEET PEATER AND RITA THEY HAVE 
BOTH NEVER HAD JOB AND HAVE SPENT 
YEARS ON THE SICK CAN HE CONVINCE 
THEM WORK IS THE BEST MEDICINE THE THE RESEARCH I AND OTHERS HAVE DONE 
SHOWS WORK IMPROVES YOUR HEALTH AND 
YOU WILL FEEL BETTER FOR IT 
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY IT IS A 
GOOD THING TO DO THAT A NOT 
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU TO 
BUT BECAUSE IT IS GOOD FOR YOU YOU YOU ARE SAYING IT IS BETTER FOR US TO 
HAVE A JOB ABSOLUTELY THE ABSOLUTELY THE GOVERNMENT THINKS SO TOO 
PETER AND RITA HAVE RECENTLY BEEN 
PUSHED OFF THE SICK AND ON TO JOB 
SEEKER'S ALLOWANCE THEY ARE 
OFFICIALLY WELL FOR WORK THEY HAVE 
NO QUALIFICATIONS AND PETER HAS 
BEEN IN AND OUT OF JAIL MOST 
RECENTLY FOR DRINK DRIVING 
I SPENT 
TEN YEARS IN JAIL WHY THEFT WHY THEFT BURGLARIES V. Y. BEEN IN JAIL FOR 
THINGS LIKE THAT 
IT WILL NOT MAKE 
EMPLOYERS RUSH TO EMPLOY YOU IT IT WILL NOT 
WE HAVE TO DISTINGUISH 
BETWEEN SOMEBODY BEING UNFIT FOR 
WORK AND PEOPLE NOT ABLE TO BE 
EMPLOYED BECAUSE OF OTHER OBSTACLES 
I HAVE LEARNT A LOT FROM YOU RIGHT 
THAT IS SOMETHING L. HOPE 
I HAVE 
NOT LEARNT MUCH FROM YOU ARE YOU 
SAYING THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE FOR ME 
YOU GET THOSE PEOPLE THERE 
I NEED TO GET OVER THEM UNTIL THEN 
I STILL SAYING THAT I AM SICK TO 
WORK L. AM TOO SICK TO GO TO WORK 
THAT IS NOT WHAT HIS INCAPACITY 
MEDICAL FOUND THOUGH HE HAS BEEN 
THROUGH BOARD THEY SAID HE IS 
NOT SICK ENOUGH TO BE ON THE SICK 
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE SAYING 
PROBABLY THAT IS RIGHT STRICTLY 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER 
OBSTACLES THEY OUTWEIGH ANY HEALTH 
CONSIDERATIONS ALL TOGETHER REALLY REALLY WHO WILL GIVE PETER A JOB 
VERY FEW 
PEOPLE PEOPLE AND THIS IS THE NUB OF THE PROBLEM 
NATIONALLY SIXTY PER CENT OF INCAPACITY 
CLAIMANTS HAVE NO SKILLS AT ALL 
GETTING THEM INTO WORK WILL BE 
TOUGH IN MERTHYR MILLIONS OF 
POUNDS OF REGENERATION MONEY HAVE 
BROUGHT NEW JOBS OVER THE PAST 
DECADE NEW EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN 
SURPRISED AT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO 
RECRUIT LOCALLY 
THEY WILL DRAW ON 
THE SKILL BASE THERE ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY WE HAVE LEARNT A LESSON 
THAT YOU CANNOT MAKE THOSE CRUDE 
ASSUMPTIONS WE NEED TO SKILL 
PEOPLE UP THE LAST THING WE WANT 
TO DO IS ATTRACT PEOPLE ALONE FROM 
OUTSIDE WHEN WE HAVE SO MANY 
PEOPLE HERE WHO COULD BE ENGAGED IN 
THIS WAY 
IF THOSE CURRENTLY ON THE SICK ARE 
NOT TAUGHT THE SKILLS EMPLOYERS 
WANT AND NEW SKILLS ARE NOT CREATED 
THE SQUEEZE ON CLAIMANTS WILL 
RESULT IN HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT 
FIGURES IF YOU MAKE THAT BIG LEAP 
TO GETTING ONE MILLION OFF YOU 
WILL HAVE TO SHIFT SOME ON TO JOB 
SEEKERS THEY WILL NOT ALL GET JOBS 
I WANT TO ASSURE EVERYBODY GETS THE 
CHANCE OF A JOB 
YOU ARE CONFIDENT 
THAT BY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE WILL NOT HAVE SEEN 
AN INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT BECAUSE 
OF THIS 
I CANNOT PREDICT WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES 
OVER THE NEXT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS 
BUT I SEE NO CONFLICT AT ALL 
BETWEEN CONTINUING TO KEEP 
UNEMPLOYMENT LOW AND REDUCING THE 
NUMBER OF THE NUMBERS ON 
INCAPACITY BENEFIT THAT WE HAVE 
SET OUT 
PETER AND RITA HAVE BEEN 
SHIFTED FROM ONE BENEFIT TO ANOTHER 
WHEN WE NEXT CATCH UP WITH THEM 
THEY'VE HAD SOME MORE BAD NEWS 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
THEY HAVE 
STOPPED MY BENEFIT THEY HAVE GIVEN 
ME THIS LETTER NOW 
CUT IT 
COMPLETELY TO QUALIFY FOR THE 
LOWER RATE JOB SEEKER'S ALLOWANCE 
PETER WAS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE PROOF 
HE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR WORK HE 
DIDN'T HAS IT COME AS A SHOCK TO 
YOU 
A SHOCK IT IS MORE THAN THAT YOU TWO WEEKS WITH NO MONEY HAS 
CERTAINLY FOCUSED HIS MIND HE IS 
APPLYING FOR SOME CLEANING JOBS HE 
HAS ALSO MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH 
HIS DOCTOR 
I AM GOING TO GO BACK 
ON THE SICK THE WAY THINGS ARE 
GOING I WILL NOT GET BACK ON IT 
TREVOR HAS HAD SOME UNEXPECTED NEWS 
AFTER A DECADE OF BEING LEFT ALONE 
HE HAS BEEN CALLED IN FOR A MEDICAL 
ASSESSMENT ASSESSMENT IF THE GOVERNMENT DOCTOR JUDGES 
TREVOR FIT FOR WORK HE COULD BE 
FORCED BACK TO THE JOBCENTRE FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY FOUR YEARS IN THE 
END THOUGH THE DOCTOR AGREED WITH 
TREVOR HE IS TOO SICK TO WORK 
LISA MARIE HAS BEEN JUDGED FIT FOR 
WORK SHE SAID SHE WOULD LIKE A JOB 
AS A SINGLE MUM SHE CAN REMAIN ON 
BENEFITS WITH NO NEED TO LOOK FOR 
ONE UNTIL HER DAUGHTER TURNS SEVEN 
MONDAY MORNING AND A BRAND NEW 
ROUTINE FOR THE FAMILY KAREN GOT 
THE JOB AT THE NURSING HOME SHE 
WAS NOT ON THE SICK BUT SHE IS 
FINALLY OFF BENEFITS 
IT IS CALVIN THOUGH WHO IS THE 
GOVERNMENT'S REAL ONE IN ONE 
MILLION THE ONLY ONE OF OUR 
MERTHYR TYDFIL CLAIMANTS TO GET OFF 
THE SICK AND BACK TO WORK HIS 
SECURITY LICENSE STILL HAD NOT 
ARRIVED SO HE HAS FOUND WORK AS A 
DELIVERY DRIVER 
IT IS A NEW START 
FOR ME L. DIDN'T THINK I WOULD WORK AGAIN 
THEIR INCOMES ARE A BIT LESS AGAIN THAN THEY HOPED FOR BUT IT IS 
STILL A LOT BETTER THAN LIFE ON THE 
SICK SICK SHELLEY JOFRE REPORTS FROM MERTHYR 
TYDFIL DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT 
IS GETTING IT RIGHT DO YOU THINK 
IT IS BEING TOO TOUGH OR NOT TOUGH 
ENOUGH IF YOU WERE AN EMPLOYER 
WOULD YOU TAKE ON SOMEBODY WHO HAS 
BEEN ON THE SICK FOR YEARS IF YOU 
ARE ON BENEFIT DO YOU THINK 
WORKING WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOUR 
HEALTH HAVE YOUR SAY ON THE 
WEBSITE NEXT WEEK HOW OUR 
EXPERIMENT POSTING A YOUNG GIRL'S 
DETAILS UP ON SOCIAL NETWORKING 
SITES ENDED WITH THE PROSECUTION OF 
THIS MAN YOU ASKED ABOUT HER BRA 
SIZE AN ON LINE PREDATOR WHO 
OFFERED OUR FOURTEEN YEAR OLD MONEY FOR 
SEX
