REFUSED TO GIVE ANY FURTHER 
STATEMENT BUT NEW DETAILS HAVE 
EMERGED ABOUT HIS SECRET DUNGEON 
THE ROOMS ARE TO BE FOUND IN A VERY OLD BUILDING FULL 
OF LITTLE CORNERS LITTLE CREVICES 
INSIDE A DEEP CELLAR AND WE COME TO 
THIS VERY OMINOUS ENTRANCE AFTER

DIFFERENT ROOMS 
DIFFERENT ROOMS 
DIFFERENT ROOMS ELISABETH FRITZL AND HER CHILDREN

CAKE AND EVERYBODY WAS ENTHUSIASTIC 
ABOUT THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE 
FAMILY TALK A LOT WITH EACH OTHER 
THAT IS CLEAR AFTER SUCH A LONG 
SEPARATION THEY'RE VERY HAPPY TO 
BE TOGETHER AGAIN OF COURSE SOME 
OF THEM SEE EACH OTHER FOR THE 
FIRST TIME 
DO THE AUSTRIAN AUTHORITIES THE 
POLICE AND SOCIAL SERVICES ACCEPT 
ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR HAVING 
ALLOWED THIS CRIME TO GO UNNOTICED 
FOR NEARLY A QUARTER OF A CENTURY 
THE RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION SO FAR SHOWS VERY 
CLEARLY THAT THE ACCUSED HAS TO BE 
SEEN AS A PERSON WHO ACTED ALONE 
AS THE INVESTIGATION PROCEEDS A 
PROFILE OF JOSEF FRITZL'S LIFE IS 
EMERGING HE WAS BORN IN AMSTETTEN 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE TO NINETY SIX HE RAN 
GUESTHOUSE WITH HIS WIFE ROSEMARY 
SHE LOOKED AFTER THE OPERATION IN 
THE SUMMERS LEAVING HIM AT HOME 
HE GOT PLANNING PERMISSION FOR THE 
CELLAR IN HIS HOUSE CITING THE 
ENTRANCE JUST ONE METRE HIGH BEHIND 
FIVE LOCKED DOORS HE WOULD LATER 
EXPAND THE BASEMENT INTO A NETWORK 
OF WINDOWLESS ROOMS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR HE 
FORCED ELISABETH INTO THE CELLAR 
HAVING BEEN SELECTED AS HIS VICTIM 
SHE HAD SEVEN CHILDREN ONE DIED 
SHORTLY AFTER BIRTH POLICE SAY 
THEY MAY CHARGE FRITZL OVER THE 
CHILD'S DEATH AND FRITZL'S 
NEIGHBOURS STILL SAY THEY SUSPECTED 
NOTHING THIS BAKERY IS RIGHT NEXT 
DOOR TO JOSEF FRITZL'S HOUSE 
HE WAS ALWAYS WELL DRESSED WHEN HE CAME INTO THE SHOP 
WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEWS THE 
WEATHER HE SEEMED LIKE A NORMAL 
PERSON PERSON TODAY POLICE DECLARED THE CASE OF 
THE SECRET DUNGEON SOLVED BUT 
THEY'VE PROMISED TO EXAMINE EVERY 
ASPECT OF FRITZL FRIT'S LIFE TO 
UNDERSTAND WHY HE COMMITTED HIS 
CRIME CRIME ELISABETH FRITZL IS SAID TO BE WEAK 
AND PALE AFTER SPENDING TWENTY FOUR YEARS IN 
THAT CELLAR HER ELDEST DAUGHTER 
KERSTIN REMAINS IN A CRITICAL 
CONDITION IN THE LOCAL HOSPITAL IN 
A COMA DOCTORS DON'T EXPECT HER 
CONDITION TO IMPROVE SOON BUT THEY 
SAY THEY WILL FIGHT TO SAVE HER 
LIFE LIFE STEVE THANK YOU 
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE STUFF OF SCIENCE 
FICTION POWDER THAT STILL UE 
LATES PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY TO 
GROW BACK BUT INCREDIBLY DOCTORS 
IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE DONE JUST 
THAT FOR ONE PATIENT IT MEANT IS 
SEVERED FING VERSE BEEN RESTORED 
NOW THE ARMY IS GETTING INTERESTED 
MATTHEW PRICE SENT THIS REPORT 
WHICH DOES CONTAIN SOME GRAPHIC 
IMAGES IMAGES SINIORA ATY OHIO IS NOT A PLACE YOU 
WITH WOULD EXPECT TO MEET MEDICAL 
MIRACLE THAT IS WHAT LEE THINKS HE 
IS 
I CUT MY FINGER OFF 
IT JUST IS SLICED IT STRAIGHT OFF 
IT TOOK IT 
OFF WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE PIECE 
WENT WE NEVER DID FIND IT HOW HOW MUCH OF THE FINGER 
IT TOOK OFF 
PROBABLY ABOUT THAT MUCH OF THE 
FINGER 
THE PHOTOS OF HIS SEVERED FINGER FINGER ARE PRETTY GRAPHIC YOU CAN 
UNDERSTAND WHY DOCTORS SAID HE HAD 
LOST IT FOR GOOD BUT IT GREW BACK 
WITH THE HELP OF A MYSTERY POWDER 
NERVES TISSUE BLOOD VESSELS SKIN 
IN JUST FOUR WEEKS 
MIRACLE MAN SPRINKLES MIRACLE 
POWDER ON HIS FINGER 
WE CALL IT 
PIXIE DUST 
THEY CALL IT PIXIE DUST 
YOU SPRINKLE AND IT GREW BACK WAS 
IT AT ALL LIKE THAT 
THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT I DID 
THIS IS WHERE 
THE PIXIE DUST COMES FROM THOUGH 
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH 
THEY CALL IT EXTRA CELLULAR MAY 
TRICKS THEY STRAIP THE CELLS FROM 
PIGS' BLADDERS DRY OUT THE TESH UE 
AND FORM SHEETS OR POWDER NORMALLY 
WHEN WE ARE WOUNDED WE SCAR BUT 
THE SCIENTISTS SAY PUTTING THE 
EXTRA CELLULAR MATRIX ON THE WOUND 
STILL UE LATES THE CELLS TO REGROW 
INSTEAD THEY HOPE THE TECHNIQUE 
MIGHT ONE DAY WORK ON ORGANS AND 
POSSIBLY MORE 
I THINK THAT WITHIN TEN YEARS I 
DON'T THINK THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO 
REGROW A NORMAL LIMB FOR YOU DO 
THINK THAT WE WILL HAVE STRATEGYS 
THAT WILL ALLOW US TO RECONSTRUCT 
THE BONES AND TO PROMOTE THE 
GROWTH OF FUPGSAL TISSUE AROUND 
THOSE BONES THAT IS MAJOR STEP 
TOWARDS THE EVENTUAL DOING THE 
ENTIRE LIMB 
THAT KIND OF TALK HAS GOT THE U. S. 
MILITARY INTERESTED THEIR JUST 
ABOUT TO START TRIALS TO REGROW 
PARTS OF THE FINGERS OF INJURED 
SOLDIERS THEY ALSO HOPE THAT THE 
MATRIX MIGHT HELP VETERANS LIKE 
THIS MAN HELP REGROW SKIN ANYTHING 
IN TERMS OF REGENERATION WOULD BE 
LIFE CHANGING 
BIG LIFE CHANGING 
ANY SURGERY YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO 
DO ANOTHER ONE I'M MORE SCARED OF 
HOSPITALS THAN I AM GOING BACK TO 
IRAQ AGAIN 
LIKE ANY DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY 
THERE ARE MANY UNKNOWNS HERE THEY 
BELIEVE THAT WITHIN THE SO CALLED 
PIXIE DUST LIES AN AMAZING 
MEDICALDISCOVERY MEDICALDISCOVERY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWELVE YEARS 
THERE'S BEEN AN ANNUAL FALL IN 
HOUSE PRICES FIGURES FROM THE 
NATIONWIDE SHOW THAT HOUSES COST ONE PER CENT 
LESS THAN THEY DID A YEAR AGO WE 
ARE IN A SITUATION WE HAVEN'T SEEN 
FOR MORE THAN A DECK WRAID OVER 
THE LAST YEAR AVERAGE HOUSE PRICES 
FELL BY ONE PER CENT THAT MIGHT NOT SOUND A 
LOT BUT IT'S THE FIRST TIME PRICES 
HAVE FALLEN OVER YEAR AS A WHOLE 
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX OVER THE LAST SIX 
MONTHS SHALL THE AVERAGE PROPERTY 
HAS SEEN ITS PRICE GO DOWN BY 
ONE THOUSAND FIFTY A MONTH FOR SOME FALLING 
PRICES ARE BAD NEWS FOR OTHERS 
THEY'RE GOOD NEWS WHO ARE THE 
WINNERS AND LOSERS IN A FALLING 
HOUSING MARKET 
WITH AVERAGE PRICES CURRENTLY MORE 
THAN SEVEN AND HALF TIMES AVERAGE 
EARNINGS FIRST TIME BUYERS ARE THE 
MOST OBVIOUS WINNERS PEOPLE MOVING 
UP THE LADDER SHOULD ALSO GAIN 
ALTHOUGH THEIR PROPERTY SHOULD FALL 
THE PROPERTY THEY ARE BUYING WILL 
FALL TOO 
THE WINNERS ARE THOSE WITH A 
DEPOSIT IN ORDER THEY'RE IN THE 
DRIVING SEAT TO GET A GOOD DEAL IN 
THE MARKET 
ANYONE WANTING TO DOWN 
SIZE IS LIKELY TO MISS OUT AS WILL 
PEOPLE BACHINGING ON PROPERTY FOR 
THEIR RETIREMENT ALTHOUGH MOST 
PEOPLE MOVING UP THE LADDER WILL 
WIN IT DEPENDS ON THE PROPERTY 
DEE SMITH IS STILL STRUGGLING TO 
SELL HER THREE BED SEMI AFTER TWO 
YEARS SHE'S CUT THE PRICE FOUR 
TIMES BUT SAYS SHE CAN'T AFFORD TO 
GO ANY LOWER 
IT'S THE PERCENTAGE 
IF EVERYWHERE THE HOUSE PRICES 
WERE FALLING EQUALLY THEN I COULD 
UNDERSTAND BUT IT'S NOT IT'S 
CERTAIN HOUSES IN CERTAIN AREAS 
THAT ARE FALLING MORE AND MORE AND 
THEN WHERE WE WANT TO GO IT'S NOT 
IT'S A SMALLER PERCENTAGE 
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT HELPING US 
ULTIMATELY THOUGH THE BALANCE 
BETWEEN WINNERS AND LOSERS COULD 
DEPEND ON THE ECONOMY AND WHAT 
EFFECT FALLING HOUSE PRICES HAVE ON 
IT IT I THINK THE REAL DANGER IS WE GET 
OURSELVES INTO A VICIOUS CIRCLE IN 
WHICH FALLING HOUSE PRICES PROMPT 
WEAKER ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WHICH 
PROMPTS UNEMPLOYMENT AND THAT IN 
TURN FALLS BACK FEEDS BACK INTO 
FALLING HOUSE PRICES 
OF COURSE THE PICTURE OF WHAT IS 
HAPPENING TO HOUSE PRICES CHANGES 
AS YOU MOVE AROUND THE U. K. AND 
EXACTLY WHO ARE THE WINNERS AND 
LOSERS DEPENDS ON INDIVIDUALS' 
CIRCUMSTANCES CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IS STORY HERE BUT IT'S NOT 
JUST BRITISH HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE 
SUFFERING FROM THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
IN AN HOUR'S TIME THE U. S. CENTRAL 
BANK WILL ANNOUNCE WHETHER IT WILL 
CUT INTEREST RATES AGAIN AS FIERCE 
OF A RECESSION MOUNT 
STEPHANIE FLANDERS IS HERE NOW 
TELL US HOW BAD IT IS OVER THERE 
WE FOCUS ON THE U. S. IT'S PARTLY 
BECAUSE IT'S A BIG MARKET FOR 
BRITISH GOODS AS YOU SAY IT MIGHT 
BE A GUIDE TO WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN 
HERE OUR ECONOMY LOOKS A LOT LIKE 
THE U. S. ECONOMY DID A YEAR OR SO AGO 
THEY HAD HAD A LONG HOUSING BOOM 
EVERYONE THERE TOOK ON A LOT OF 
DEBT PEOPLE THINK WHERE THEY GO 
WE WILL FOLLOW ONE MEMBER OF THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND MONETARY POLICY 
COMMITTEE SAID HE THOUGHT WE WERE 
SIX MONTHS BEHIND THEM IN TERMS OF 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN THE U. S. CENTRAL 
BANG THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS 
PROBABLY GOING TO CUT INTEREST 
RATES AGAIN LATER ON TONIGHT IT 
WILL HOPE THERE WERE SOME WEAK 
GROWTH FIGURES THAT CAME OUT TODAY 
IT WILL HOPE IT'S THE LAST TIME 
THAT IT HAS TO DO THAT AND THE 
ECONOMY WILL PICK UP IN THE SECOND 
HALF OF THE YEAR THERE ARE THOSE 
WHO THINK THAT'S OPTIMISTIC YOU 
MIGHT EVEN HAVE A DOUBLE DIP THAT 
THE ECONOMY MIGHT SLIP BACK DOWN 
AGAIN AND THEY MIGHT HAVE TO START 
CUTTING RATE AGAIN AT THE TIME 
THAT WOULD BE BAD NEWS FOR THEM AND 
US 
THANK YOU US PRINCE WILLIAM HAS MADE A FLYING 
VISIT TO AFGHANISTAN THE PRINCE 
WHO IS COMING TO THE END OF A FOUR 
MONTH ATTACH THE WITH THE R. A. F. 
HELPED A PILOT TO TRANSPORT A PLANE

WHERE HE MET BRITISH TROOPS 
NICHOLAS WITCHELL REPORTS 
WILLIAM SPENT JUST THREE HOURS ON 
THE GROUND IN AFGHANISTAN AT THE 
MAIN MILITARY AIR BASE AT KANDAHAR 
DURING THAT TIME AS THESE 
PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE MINISTRY OF

AIRCRAFT ON SUNDAY AND WHAT IS 
DESCRIBED AFTER A SHORT PERIOD HE 
FLEW THE AIRCRAFT BEFORE THE PLANE 
TOUCHED DOWN AT THE HUGE KANDAHAR 
BASE BUT WILLIAM'S VISIT WAS 
MEASURED IN HOURS COMPARED TO THE 
TEN WEEKS HIS BROTHER HARRY SPENT 
ON AN OPERATIONAL TOUR OF DUTY IN 
AFGHANISTAN UNDERLINES THE 
DIFFERENT ROLES THE TWO PRINCES 
HAVE HARRY IS PURSUING A CAREER AS 
A SOLDIER WILLIAM IS PREPARING FOR 
HIS FUTURE ROLE AS HEAD OF STATE 
ONE DAY HE WILL BE COMMANDER IN 
CHIEF HE WILL HAVE TO KNOW WHAT 
THESE GUYS KNOW NOT JUST THE GUYS

FANCY JET FIGHTERS BUT ALSO THE 
PEOPLE WHO TRANSPORT THE LOGISTICS 
TO THE SHARP END 
AND THE FUTURE KING WAS REMINDED ON 
THIS VISIT OF THE PRICE BEING PAID 
BY OTHER YOUNG MEMBERS OF THE ARMED 
SERVICES THE AIRCRAFT THAT FLEW 
WILLIAM HOME ALSO BROUGHT THE BODY 
OF TROOPER ROBERT PEARSON OF THE 
QUEEN'S ROYAL LANCERS WHO WAS 
KILLED LAST WEEK BY A MINE FOR 
FLYING OFFICER WALES WHO RECEIVED 
HIS WINGS THIS MONTH TODAY'S 
IMAGES OFFER SOME RESPITE FROM THE 
CRITICISM HE HAS BEEN RECEIVING 
OVER THE MISUSE OF AN R. A. F. 
HELICOPTER TO GET TO A PRIVATE 
PARTY PARTY CLARENCE HOUSE CATEGORICALLY DENIES 
THAT WILLIAM'S VISIT TO AFGHANISTAN 
WAS ARRANGED TO COUNTER ALL OF THE 
CRITICISM ABOUT THE MISJUDGED 
HELICOPTER USE THE TRIP TO 
KANDAHAR THEY SAY WAS ARRANGED 
WEEKS AGO 
OUR TOP STORY AUSTRIAN POLICE 
REVEAL OUT THE INCEST CASE FATHER 
BUILT AND EXTENDED WHAT THEY ARE 
CALLING A DUNKION 
STILL TO COME I'M HERE AT STAMFORD 
BRIDGE AS CHELSEA AND LIVERPOOL 
CHASE A PLACE IN THE CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE ENGLISH FANS WORRY ABOUT 
HOW TO GET TO MOSCOW LATER ON B. B. C. 
LONDON FANCY GETTING TO WORK ON 
ONE OF THESE PLUS 
THIS IS A 
PICCADILLY LINE SERVICE THE THE CAPITAL IS INVADED BY ALIENS 
GORDON BROWN HAS ADMITTED HE MADE 
MISTAKES WHEN HE ABOLISHED THE TEN 
PENCE RATE OF INCOME TAX HE SAID 
HE'S DOING HIS BEST TO SORT IT OUT 
HE ACCUSED DAVID CAMERON OF BEING A 
SHALLOW SALESMAN OUR POLITICAL 
EDITOR NICK ROBINSON IS AT 
WESTMINSTER FOR US WE HAVE MADE 
MISTAKES THOSE ARE THREE WORDS 
THAT NO POLITICIAN LIKES TO USE 
NOT EVEN AT THE BEST OF TIMES FOR 
GORDON BROWN TO UTTER THEM ON THE 
EVE OF IMPORTANT ELECTIONS IS A 
DEMONSTRATION THAT HE'S DESPERATE 
TO REDUCE THE DAMAGE TO HIM BY THAT 
TEN PENCE TAX FIASCO AND ALSO THAT 
HE REALISES THAT TOMORROW'S 
ELECTIONS WILL MATTER FOR HIM SURE 
THEY ARE LOCAL ELECTIONS NOT 
NATIONAL ONES SURE MANY PEOPLE IN 
THE COUNTRY WILL NOT CHOSE TO VOTE 
OR DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A VOTE AT 
ALL AND YET HE KNOWS AND EVERYBODY 
IN WESTMINSTER KNOWS THAT THE 
RESULTS IN THOSE ELECTIONS WILL AT 
LEAST HELP SHAPE THE CONTEXT OF 
POLITICS FOR THE NEXT YEAR AHEAD 
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME OF THE 
ISSUES EVERY COUNCIL IS DIFFERENT 
AND EVERY ELECTION LOCAL THE 
RESULTS COULD BE THE BUILDING 
BLOCKS FOR NATIONAL SUCCESS 
READING HAS BEEN LABOUR RED 
THROUGHOUT THE BLAIR YEARS READING 
HAS BEEN A SYMBOL OF THE FACT THAT 
NEW LABOUR COULD DO WELL IN THE 
OF ENGLAND WHERE PEOPLE WERE 
SOUTH OF ENGLAND WHERE PEOPLE WERE PROSPERING BUT AS THE ECONOMY IS 
TURNING HERE AND ELSEWHERE THE 
QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS YEAR 
LABOUR'S POLITICAL FORTUNES IN THE 
SOUTH WILL TURN AS WELL WHEN HI 
TECH READING BOOMED LABOUR BOOMED 
WITH T. BUT NOW THE DOUBTS ARE 
CREEPING IN MUMS WHO ONCE VOTED 
LABOUR AND LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE 
CONTEMPLATING A CHANGE 
I WANT TO 
SEE SOMETHING NEW AND WHAT THEY 
HAVE GOT TO OFFER IF IT IS BETTER 
THAN WHAT WE HAVE GOT NOW 
I FEEL I 
SHOULD BE VERY LOYAL TO LABOUR BUT 
THINGS ARE SO HARD AND SO DIFFICULT 
AND YOU WORK SO HARD AND YOU SEEM 
TO HAVE NOTHING AND I JUST DON'T 
KNOW 
FUEL PRICES ARE RIDICULOUS KNOW THE COUNCIL TAX IS RIDICULOUS I 
WOULD LIKE TO BUY MY OWN HOUSE 
THERE IS NO WAY I CAN DO THAT EVEN 
THOUGH I HAVE GOOD MONEY COMING IN 
AND IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO LOOK 
AT WHAT CONSERVATIVES CAN OFFER 
SUCCESS IN THE SOUTH IS NOT ENOUGH 
FOR THE TORIES TO GET BACK INTO 
GOVERNMENT THEY NEED TO PAINT THE 
TOWNS OF THE NORTH BLUE LIKE 
BRADFORD WHERE THEY ONCE 
CONTROLLED PRIVATELY TEAM CAMERON 
WORRY ABOUT WHY WEST YORKSHIRE HAS 
REMAINED SO RESISTANT TO THEIR 
CHARMS SIMMERING ANXIETY ABOUT THE 
ECONOMY MAY JUST CHANGE THAT 
BRADFORD'S CURRY KING IS FEELING 
THE HEAT IN HIS RESTAURANT AND IN 
HIS FACTORY 
ALL THE CUSTOMERS WHO 
COME TO THE RESTAURANT THEY ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT THEIR HOUSES AND 
THEIR BUSINESSES AND FOR US 
PERSONALLY 
DOWN THE ROAD IT IS PERSONALLY QUIZ NIGHT BEGINNING TONIGHT WITH 
A TOPICAL LIMERICK COMPETITION THE THE FIRST LINE IS SO THE LESS WELL OFF 
PAY MORE TAX I WOULD LIKE TO TICK 
CROWN IN THE NACKS HE HAS CONNED 
US ONCE AND CONNED US TWICE BUT WE 
DON'T HAVE THE FINAL LINE 
WHAT DID 
YOU MAKE OF GORDON BROWN 
I DON'T 
THINK HE'LL DO DO 
COMPARED TO 
MARGARET THATCHER'S YEARS I WILL 
SETTLE FOR TONY BLAIR AND GORDON 
BROWN AND I WOULD SETTLE FOR RAVING 
LOONEY PARTY BEFORE I WOULD HAVE 
HER BACK 
LOCAL ELECTIONS ARE JUST 
THAT LOCAL EVERY PLACE DIFFERENT 
AND YET THERE ARE SIGNS OF A NEW 
NATIONAL MOOD L. MOOD OF 
UNCERTAINTY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE 
GOVERNMENT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE 
ALTERNATIVES BUT ABOVE ALL ABOUT 
THE FUTURE NICK AS YOU YOURSELF 
HAVE JUST SAID PEOPLE WILL BE 
VOTING ON ALL SORTS OF LOCAL ISSUES 
SO REALLY WHAT IMPACT DOES THIS 
HAVE ON NATIONAL POLITICS 
THAT IS 
RIGHT PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT BINS OR 
SCHOOLS OR BUSES AS THEY CHOSE 
WHETHER TO VOTE AND HOW TO VOTE 
YET REMEMBER THAT POLITICS IS A 
TEAM GAME GEORGE A AND RESULTS 
ARE BUILT OVER TIME THE BUILDING 
BLOCKS FOR NATIONAL SUCCESS ARE 
OFTEN LOCAL AND TEAM MORALE IS VERY 
IMPORTANT HOW YOU ARE YOUR TEAM 
APPEARS TO BE DOG IF GORDON BROWN 
LOSES KEN LIVINGSTONE IN LONDON AND 
LOSES A LOT OF COUNCILLORS AND THE 
VOTE SHARE IS BAD THAT WILL FUEL 
THE DOUBTS IF HE DOES MUCH BETTER 
THE DOUBTS WILL TURN TO DAVID 
CAMERON AND THEY'LL SAY OF HIM WHY 
AREN'T YOU DOING WELL ENOUGH LET'S 
NOT FORGET NICK CLEGG HIS FIRST 
ELECTORAL TEST AS LEADER THEY LAST 
FOUGHT THESE ELECTIONS FOUR YEARS 
AGO WHEN THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
WERE DOING VERY WELL OFF THE BACK 
OF THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE WAR IN 
IRAQ VERY TRICKY FOR THEM TO MAKE 
ANY GAINS THEY WILL DESPERATELY 
LOOK FOR ANY EVIDENCE THEY CAN FIND 
AT ALL TO SAY THAT HIS PARTY IS NOT 
IN RETREAT LOCALLY THEY MATTER 
BUT DON'T YOU BELIEVE ANYONE WHO 
SAYS THAT NATIONALLY THEY DON'T 
MATTER VERY MUCH AS WELL 
THANK YOU 
HE'S ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS 
FOOTBALLERS ON THE PLANET BUT THIS 
TIME THE HEADLINES ARE NOT ABOUT 
RONALDO'S PLAYING ABILITY THE 
WORLD CUP WINNER HAS BEEN 
QUESTIONED BY POLICE OVER AN 
INCIDENT INVOLVING THREE 
PROSTITUTES WHO TURNED OUT TO BE 
TRANSVESTITES IT IS ONE OF SPORTS 
MORE BIZARRE MATCHUPS THE MAN WHO 
WAS ONCE THE WORLD'S GREATEST 
FOOTBALLER AND A BRAZILIAN 
PROSTITUTE KNOWN AS ANDREA BUT IN 
REALITY A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD MAN HE SAYS 
HE DIDN'T REALISE THAT WHEN HE 
ASKED HER AND TWO OTHERS TO A MOTEL 
IN RIO BEFORE EVENTUALLY REALISING 
THAT THE THREE WOMEN WERE ACTUALLY 
MEN IT WAS AT THAT POINT RONALDO 
SAYS THAT SHE DEMANDED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO 
KEEP QUIET AND STOLE HIS I. D. CARD 
WHICH HE HAS BEEN SHOWING OFF TO 
THE MEDIA HE ALSO ACCUSED RONALDO 
FOR ASKING HIM TO BUY DRUGS ALL 
THREE TRANSVESTITES WERE LATER 
INTERVIEWED BY THE POLICE ALONG 
WITH RONALDO HIMSELF 
ACCORDING TO THE POLICE CHIEF 
RONALDO SAYS HE WAS NOT GOING TO 
PAY THE MONEY AND DID NOTHING WRONG 
HE 
HAS ISSUED STATEMENT SAYING HE HAS NEVER TAKEN DRUGS AND HE'S BEEN 
THE VICTIM OF ATTEMPTED EXTORTION 
BUT THE HEADLINE WRITERS HAVE 
RARELY HAD SUCH FUN FOOTBALL HAS 
SEEN SOME INTERESTING ENCOUNTERS 
OVER THE YEARS BUT RONALDO AND 
ANDRE IS ONE THAT IS UNLIKELY TO BE 
FORGOTTEN 
AWAY FROM THE CAMERAS FORGOTTEN AND ON THE PITCH NEXT MONTH WE'LL 
SEE THE FIRST EVER ALL ENGLISH

LOOKS LIKE IT WILL HAVE ALL ENGLISH 
WEATHER BUT KICKOFF IS IN JUST 
OVER AN HOUR'S TIME NOW IT BRINGS 
A NEW MEANING TO THE PHRASE A 
BOUNCING BABY BOY THIS RITUAL SEES 
BABIES BEING THROWN FROM A FIFTY FOOT 
TOWER ON TO A CLOTH SHEET DEVOTEES 
BELIEVE THE PRACTICE BRINGS THEIR 
CHILD GOOD HEALTH LOCALS SAY THAT 
NONE OF THE CHILDREN HAVE EVER BEEN 
HARMED IN THE FIVE HUNDRED YEAR OLD HISTORY 
OF THE EVENT WHAT IS WRONG WITH 
BOUNCING THEM ON OUR KNEES NOW THE 
WEATHER 
IT'S NOT BEEN GREAT A BIT LIKE YOU 
SAW OUTSIDE CHELSEA INDICATIVE OF 
WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE GOT 
A SEVERE WEATHER WARNING IN FORCE 
IT IS PRIMARILY FOR PARTS OF THE 
EAST MIDLANDS AND YORKSHIRE WE 
HAVE BEEN TRACKING THE RAIN IT HAS 
MOVED UP THROUGH THE DAY HEAVY AND 
INTENSE PULSES SOME TREACHEROUS 
DRIVING CONDITIONS A LOT OF 
SURFACE WATER AND SPRAY OUT ON THE 
ROADS THE SHOWERS WILL EASE 
THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES STILL RATHER 
UNSETTLED IN SCOTLAND A FRESHER 
NIGHT TO COME TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 
FIVE AND SEVEN TOMORROW MORNING WE'LL 
START OFF ENGLAND AND WALES MAYBE 
DRY AND BRIGHT FOR A TIME BUT WE'LL 
START TO SEE ONE OR TWO SHOWERS 
DEVELOPING THE LONGER SPELLS OF 
RAIN WILL CONTINUE BUT I THINK 
INTO THE AFTERNOON WE COULD SEE 
SHARP AND POSSIBLY THUNDERY 
DOWNPOURS IN THE SOUTH EAST MILDER 
WITH SIXTEEN DEGREES THE SHOWERS 
CONTINUING ACROSS MUCH OF ENGLAND 
AND WALES MAYBE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
SEEING A SLIGHTLY DRYER AFTERNOON 
TO COME AND THE RAIN WILL START TO 
EASE A TOUCH IN SCOTLAND I THINK 
DURING THE AFTERNOON SLIGHTLY 
BRIGHTER SKIES HERE THAT WON'T BE 
THE CASE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
WE'LL SEE BITS AND PIECES OF 
SHOWERY RAIN CONTINUING HERE FOR 
MUCH OF WALES THOUGH ONE OR TWO 
SHOWERS DOTTED AROUND BUT FINGERS 
CROSSED THERE WILL BE SUNNY SPELLS 
TOO TEMPERATURES QUITE PLEASANT 
ONE OR TWO SHOWERS FOR THE SOUTH 
WEST BUT WE MAY SEE SOME SUNNY 
SPELLS AND IT MAY WELL FEEL A 
LITTLE MORE PLEASANT IN THE 
SUNSHINE AS WE MOVE TO FRIDAY IT 
WILL FINALLY BE A DRYER AND 
BRIGHTER DAY FEWER SHOWERS 
TEMPERATURES A LITTLE WARMER WITH 
SEVENTEEN DEGREES BANK HOLIDAY WEEKEND 
CAUSING US PROBLEMS AT THE MOMENT 
THE EAST LOOKS LIKE STAYING DRY 
WARM AND SUNNY THE WEST WOULD BE 
PRETTY WET THE MAIN NEWS POLICE
