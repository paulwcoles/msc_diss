YOU TELL ME GUARD MY HEART I MIGHT GET HURT 
NO DOUBT YOU'LL HURT MY FEELINGS IT'S A GIVEN I'LL BE KNEELING

OR ALONE THAT WOULD BE BETTER 
IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT AND I AIN'T GOT NOBODY 
OH WHAT'S THE USE OF MAKING A BED 
I TOOK SOMETHING AND IT FEELS LIKE KARATE 
IT'S KICKED ME DOWN AND LEFT ME FOR DEAD 
IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT AND I AIN'T GOT NOBODY 
SO WHAT'S THE USE OF PULLING A SHAPE 
I PUT WHAT I WANT WHEN I WANT IN MY BODY 
I'M NEVER GONNA GIVE WHAT I TAKE 
IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT AND I AIN'T GOT NOBODY 
OH WHAT'S THE USE OF MAKING A BED 
I TOOK SOMETHING AND IT FEELS LIKE KARATE 
IT'S KICKED ME DOWN AND LEFT ME FOR DEAD 
IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT AND I AIN'T GOT NOBODY 
SO WHAT'S THE USE OF PULLING A SHAPE 
I PUT WHAT I WANT WHEN I WANT IN MY BODY 
I'M NEVER GONNA GIVE WHAT I TAKE
