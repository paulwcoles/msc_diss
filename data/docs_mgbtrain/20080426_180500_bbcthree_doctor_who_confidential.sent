HOW A LITTLE BOX IN YOUR CAR CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE SKY AND TELL YOU WHERE YOU'RE GOING

I CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A LINK 
IT'S QUITE AN ADULT OPENING FOR AN EPISODE I THINK AND HORRIBLE 
POOR WOMAN POOR JO PLUNGING IN TO THE CANAL LIKE THAT 
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS 
THIS IS YOUR FINAL DESTINATION 
I SAID TAKE ME TO UNIT

IT GETS A LOT OF MYSTERY SAYING WHAT'S GOING ON HERE 
THIS IS YOUR FINAL DESTINATION

THANKFULLY THE DOCTOR WHO CREW HAVE SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATED 
THEMSELVES TO THE EDGE OF CARDIFF DOCKS 
AND FOR TONIGHT'S FILMING 
A USUALLY BUOYANT TEAM HAVE THAT SINKING FEELING 
THIS IS A BIG NUMBER FOR US LOCATION FINDING A LOCATION 
TO HAVE HARD STANDING NEAR WATER 
AND THE CAR THAT YOU SEE BEHIND YOU IS A DOUBLE 
THIS ONE'S BEEN WITH ANY EFFECTS OF THE PAST WEEK 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR DOCTOR WHO 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME SINCE DOCTOR WHO'S BEEN BACK 
ON THE SCREENS THAT WE'VE DONE A CAR CANNON 
SO IT'S QUITE A BIGGIE FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING MYSELF 
THIS VEHICLE HERE ARRIVED 
AT OUR WORKSHOP ABOUT A WEEK AGO AND SINCE THEN WE'VE BEEN STRIPPING 
OUT THE CAR TAKING ALL THE SEATS OUT THE FUEL TANK AND PUTTING IN 
A SPECIAL HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WHICH IS WHAT WE CALL A CAR CANNON 
THE CAR CANNON CONSISTS OF A LONG METAL TUBE WHICH IS 
PUMPED FULL OF GAS AT HIGH PRESSURE READY TO BE FIRED OFF LIKE A ROCKET 
TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK 
WE WERE TESTING AT A LOWER PRESSURE TO MAKE SURE THE WHOLE SYSTEM WAS WORKING 
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY LEAKS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
THREE TWO ONE 
BY THE TIME IT'S LEAVING THE BANK 
IT'S PROBABLY DOING ABOUT SIXTY M. P. H. SO IT'LL BE FLYING INTO THE WATER 
WE ONLY HAVE ONE SHOT AT THIS SO 
WE'VE GOT FIVE CAMERAS PLACED THREE OF THEM MANNED AND TWO UNMANNED 
THE THREE MANNED ONES ARE AT THE BEST POSITION TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING 
I WAS ONCE ASKED HOW DO YOU DIRECT 
I SAID YOU JUST STAND IN THE BEST PLACE AND YOU PUT A CAMERA THERE TO SEE THE STORY HAPPENING 
WHO'S IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT 
I HAVEN'T NAMED HER YET ACTUALLY 
IT'S A BIT ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES BUT SHE'LL CERTAINLY LOOK A BIT 
WORSE WHEN WE PULL HER OUT 
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT TAKE ONE CAMERA MARK 
A SET CAMERA B. SET 
C. SET 
ALL READY YEAH FIVE READY IN FIVE 
THERE'S GONNA BE A LOUD WHOOSH 
FOUR THREE TWO ONE 
LAUNCH 
SAID HEY TAKE CONTROL OF ME 
TAKE CONTROL OF ME 
TAKE CONTROL OF ME 
TAKE CONTROL OF ME 
MARVELLOUS 
THAT LOOKED GREAT YOU'LL BE PLEASED 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IT'S FAB 
AND WHAT GOES DOWN APPARENTLY MUST COME UP 
IT'S A BUSY WORKING DOCKS AND THIS IS THEIR MAIN 
SHIPPING LANE SO IT'S GOT TO BE OUT BY TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE 
YEAH IT WILL BE 
WE HAVE A LARGE CRANE STANDING BY IN ORDER TO GET IT OUT 
IT'S GOT A LONG ARM TO PULL IT OUT 
WE'VE GOT DIVERS STANDING BY TO RECOVER THE VEHICLE 
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS POP THE DIVER IN 
AND HE'LL GO DOWN 
WITH THE CHAINS AND HOOK ONTO THE STROPS THAT WE'VE FIXED TO THE CAR 
AND THEN IT SHOULD ALL COME UP NICELY 
SO BRING IT ON 
BRING IT ON 
ALL YOUR SHATTERED DREAMS 
AND I'LL SCATTER THEM INTO THE SEA 
A FAMILIAR FACE AT UNIT BASE TODAY IS UNIT'S FINEST 
MARTHA'S BACK THIS WAS ALWAYS A LONG PLAN STARTED A LONG WHILE AGO 
ORIGINALLY SHE LEFT SERIES THREE BECAUSE SHE WAS IN A STATE OF UNREQUITED LOVE FOR THE DOCTOR 
O. K. 
THE ONLY WAY TO BREAK A STATE OF UNREQUITED LOVE IS 
TO LEAVE AND NOT SEE THEM LISTEN TO ME THAT'S A LESSON IN LIFE 
NOT JUST IN DOCTOR WHO SO IT'S HER GROWING UP AND MOVING ON 
SO THIS IS ME GETTING OUT 
ONE OF THE REASONS THE SHOW IS SO SUCCESSFUL IS THE EMOTIONAL 
BELIEVABILITY OF THE CHARACTERS AND AFTER YOU'VE INVESTED IN THAT 
IT'S GOT TO BE YOU KNOW RIGHT 
HAVING BEEN THROUGH ALL THAT SHE HAD THERE WASN'T ANY JUSTIFIABLE 
WAY THAT SHE COULD STICK AROUND FULL TIME ON THE TARDIS 
IF THAT RINGS WHEN THAT RINGS YOU BETTER COME RUNNING YOU GOT IT 
GOT IT 
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN MISTER 
THIS IS MY COMEBACK GIRL 
HELLO HI 
THIS IS MY COMEBACK GIRL 
HELLO MORNING 
IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK 
IT IN MANY WAYS FEELS LIKE I'VE NOT GONE ANYWHERE 
A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS DON'T KNOW WHO I'M GOING TO BE SITTING NEXT TO 
YEAH IT DOES KIND OF FEEL LIKE THE 
FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL IT REALLY DOES YOU ARE SORT OF 
HELLO HELLO FREEMA 
NICE TO SEE YOU 
BUT IT'S NICE COS I'M SEEING EVERYBODY THAT WAS HERE LAST YEAR 
I'M GONNA GO AND GET CHANGED NOW BUT I THINK 
WE'RE GONNA TAKE PICTURES YOU SHOULD COME ALONG AND SEE 
AND WHEN YOU HAVE TWO HEARTS CLEARLY THREE IS NOT A CROWD 
I THINK THE DOCTOR'S NERVOUS ABOUT SEEING HER AGAIN 
IT'S ALWAYS NERVE WRACKING MEETING UP WITH AN EX ISN'T IT 
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S ONE THAT THAT IT DIDN'T END 
ENTIRELY HAPPILY WITH 
MAYBE HE DIDN'T BEHAVE AS WELL AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE 
WHEN HE STARTS LOOKING BACK AT IT 
THAT'S A PHONE 
IT'S NICE THAT SHE'S ACTUALLY CALLING HIM ON 
THAT PHONE THAT SHE LEFT WITH HIM 
THAT'S A CALL HE'S GOT TO ANSWER REALLY HE'S GOT A DUTY THERE 
HELLO 
THERE'S A WHOLE RAFT OF 
POSSIBLE REACTIONS HE MIGHT GET FROM HER 
DOCTOR IT'S MARTHA 
I THINK HE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS AS TO QUITE WHICH 
VERSION OF MARTHA'S WILL BE GREETING HIM AS HE STEPS OUT THE TARDIS 
WRITING THE SCENE WHERE MARTHA AND THE DOCTOR MEET 
IT WAS REALLY HARD VERY PRESSUREFUL BECAUSE YOU WANT EVERYTHING IN IT 
THERE'S SO MUCH TO SAY BUT 
EQUALLY YOU DON'T WANT TO STAND THEM STILL AND HAVE AN EIGHT MINUTE SCENE 
THEY JUST IN THE END HAVE A BEAUTIFULLY HUMAN ENCOUNTER WHERE 
ACTUALLY VERY LITTLE IS SAID BUT THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF EMOTION AND 
SUBTEXT OF MEANING BEHIND IT 
ACTION 
I ALWAYS KNEW 
HELEN IN WRITING I THINK ALWAYS KNEW AS WELL THAT THERE'D 
BE THAT BEAUTIFUL TENSION AS THE DOCTOR STEPS OUT THE TARDIS 
MARTHA JONES 
IT COULD BE AWKWARD IT COULD BE STRANGE WHAT I THINK IS 
LOVELY ABOUT THAT SCRIPT IS THAT ALL THE TENSIONS JUST DISAPPEAR 
WHEN SHE MEETS HIM AGAIN IT IS VERY MUCH IN A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL 
IN A PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY 
THERE IS A DIFFERENT DYNAMIC BETWEEN THEM SHE DOESN'T HAVE THAT 
NEED FOR THE DOCTOR THAT SHE HAD BEFORE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW 
HAVING A LOVE RECIPROCATED 
BUT OF COURSE SHE'S OVERWHELMED TO SEE HIM 
BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT THIS AMAZING FRIENDSHIP 
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT 
NEITHER HAVE YOU 
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S MOVED ON TO A DIFFERENT PLACE 
HOW'S THE FAMILY YOU KNOW NOT SO BAD RECOVERING 
WHAT ABOUT YOU 
HE'S BRINGING THE NEW GIRL ALONG 
AND HE'S NERVOUS THAT THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE RUCTIONS 
RIGHT SHOULD HAVE KNOWN 
WHEN DONNA AND MARTHA MEET THERE IS THAT MOMENT 
IN THAT SILENCE WHERE THERE'S PROBABLY 
A MILLION THINGS GOING THROUGH MARTHA'S HEAD BUT SHE DOES START BY SAYING TO THE DOCTOR 
DIDN'T TAKE YOU LONG TO REPLACE ME THEN NOW 
SHE'S COMFORTABLE ENOUGH WITH WHERE SHE IS IN HER LIFE AND WHERE SHE 
KNOWS THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS TO MAKE A JOKE ABOUT THAT 
HIS INITIAL IMPULSE IS COME ON GIRLS TIME OUT ROUND ONE 
MARTHA DONNA DONNA MARTHA PLEASE DON'T FIGHT I CAN'T BEAR FIGHTING 
YOU WISH I'VE HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU 
IT'S A LOVELY SCENE WHEN THE THREE OF THEM COME TOGETHER 
AND YOU CAN SEE THE DOCTOR STANDING ON GUARD GETTING READY TO 
BREAK UP A MASSIVE CATFIGHT WHICH OF COURSE DOESN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH MATURE LADIES 
HE TALKS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME I DREAD TO THINK NO NO NO HE SAYS NICE THINGS 
DONNA WOULDN'T SEE HER AS A RIVAL 
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T LOOK AT THE DOCTOR IN A ROMANTIC WAY 
DIDN'T TAKE LONG TO GET OVER IT THOUGH WHO'S THE LUCKY MAN 
WHAT MAN LUCKY WHAT 
SHE'S ENGAGED YOU PRAWN 
AND THEN OF COURSE MARTHA'S GOT OVER THE DOCTOR AS WELL SO HE 
SUDDENLY FINDS HIMSELF BEING GANGED UP ON 
HE IS TOO SKINNY FOR WORDS YOU GIVE HIM A HUG YOU GET A PAPER CUT 
OH I'D RATHER YOU WERE FIGHTING 
SPEAKING OF WHICH 
THIS IS DOCTOR JONES OPERATION BLUE SKY IS GO GO GO 
I REPEAT THIS IS A GO 
SO JUST WHERE HAS THIS MILITANT MARTHA JONES COME FROM 
TORCHWOOD THAT'S WHERE 
MISS MARTHA JONES 
WHEN DO SEE MARTHA IN TORCHWOOD 
SHE IS SHE'S LOST THAT WIDE EYEDNESS IF YOU LIKE 
HAVE YOU RUN AN ISOENZYME ANALYSIS ON IT 
DID I MENTION SHE WAS BRILLIANT 
WHEN SHE WAS WITH THE DOCTOR SHE DID HAVE THAT WIDE EYEDNESS ABOUT HER AND HE WAS VERY MUCH 
SHOWING HER EVERYTHING AND THE LEADER IF YOU LIKE 
WE CAN'T JUST SEND HER IN LIKE THIS TRUST ME SHE'S MORE THAN CAPABLE 
SO NOW WITH HIM OUT OF THE PICTURE SHE'S VERY MUCH 
TAKING IT ALL ON BOARD HERSELF 
SHE'S BEEN IN WORSE SITUATIONS THAN THIS 
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT 
I AM NOT TAKING THAT 
HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD 
OH IT WORKED 
WE'VE SEEN HER GROW UP 
NOT THAT SHE WAS EVER A CHILD IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT 
YOU DON'T STOP GROWING UP WHEN YOU'RE SIXTY YEARS OLD EVEN 
HER RED BLOOD CELL COUNT IS THROUGH THE FLOOR AND SHE'S MASSIVELY DEHYDRATED 
AH HA HA HA HA HA 
SHE'S HARDENED BY HER EXPERIENCES 
SO YEAH WHEN WE DO SEE HER AGAIN 
THERE IS A DIFFERENT ENERGY ABOUT HER 
AN INVASION BY UNIT TAKES MILITARY PLANNING 
TODAY THE CAST AND CREW ARE ON 
LOCATION PREPARING FOR THE MOMENT WE MEET A THOROUGHLY MODERN MARTHA 
I REPEAT THIS IS A GO 
QUICK MARCH 
LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT 
I MEAN IT'S A BIG SET PIECE REALLY IT LOOKS FABULOUS AND IT'S 
QUITE NICE TO GET YOUR TEETH INTO THAT SORT OF THING 
YOU BECOME A BIT OF A REGIMENTAL SERGEANT MAJOR 
IT IS ORGANISATIONAL SKILLS AND BIT OF LUNG POWER REALLY 
HOLD IT THERE GUYS 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU THINK WILL BE REALLY EASY 
PEOPLE MARCHING IN A LINE IT NEVER IS 
GUYS YOU ALL REALLY NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION 
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING LIKE YOU'RE IN SYNC WITH ONE ANOTHER 
YOU'RE LISTENING TO HIM KEEPING AN EYE ON THE PERSON OPPOSITE YOU 
BECAUSE THAT WAS JUST MESSY 
THEM ALL INTO ONE SPOT AND THEN YEAH GOING THROUGH IT AND GOING 
THROUGH IT SO THAT HOPEFULLY IT LOOKS SORT OF AS IT SHOULD 
LET'S TRY ONE MORE TIME 
ALL FACING FRONT 
AND ACTION CLIVE 
UNIT 
UNIT QUICK MARCH 
LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT 
WAR LOOK OUT 
WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR 
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LISTEN TO ME 
WAR I DESPISE 
COS IT MEANS DESTRUCTION 
OF INNOCENT LIVES 
WAR 
HE'S NOT NECESSARILY SURPRISED THAT HE SHE'S WORKING FOR UNIT 
BUT THE DOCTOR'S RELATIONSHIP WITH UNIT 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN SLIGHTLY AMBIGUOUS 
THEY'RE A BRANCH OF THE MILITARY 
THEY USE GUNS A LOT 
THEY'RE QUITE KEEN ON BLOWING THINGS UP 
THAT ISN'T REALLY THE WAY THE DOCTOR LIKES TO WORK 
WAR IT AIN'T NOTHING 
BUT A HEART BREAK 
WAR SEND ONLY 
TO THE UNDERTAKER 
OH WAR 
SO I THINK HE'S STRUGGLING TO KNOW QUITE HOW 
HE FEELS ABOUT WHAT MARTHA'S DOING 
WHAT ARE YOU SEARCHING FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS 
I THINK HE IS GENUINELY PLEASED TO SEE HER 
BUT MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICER IF THEY'D MET FOR A CUP OF TEA FIRST 
RATHER THAN BEING PLUNGED STRAIGHT INTO THIS AGGRESSIVE SITUATION 
ALL WORKERS LAY DOWN YOUR TOOLS AND SURRENDER IMMEDIATELY 
THIS IS A UNIT OPERATION 
E. SECTION MOBILISED E. SECTION 
MARTHA NOW IS SUCH AN EQUAL FOR THE DOCTOR THAT 
SHE STANDS HER GROUND SHE SAYS ACTUALLY SHE'S NOT CARRYING A GUN 
YOU'RE QUALIFIED NOW YOU'RE A PROPER DOCTOR 
UNIT RUSHED IT THROUGH GIVEN MY EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD HERE WE GO 
SHE'S WORKING WITHIN UNIT WITH ALL OF THE DOCTOR'S 
PASSION AND CARE AND FAITH 
SO SHE'S BECOME A DOCTOR IN HER OWN RIGHT PROPERLY 
BOTH MEDICALLY AND LIKE OUR DOCTOR 
DONNA THINKS GOD THIS GIRL HAS GONE ON 
TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND SHE'S OBVIOUSLY BRAVE 
SHE'S FAIRLY IMPRESSED BY MARTHA I THINK 
SHE'S CURIOUS ABOUT HER AND SHE DOESN'T FEEL SHE'S A RIVAL 
BUT AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT EVEN REALISING IT SHE UPS HER GAME 
A LITTLE BIT WHEN SHE SEES WHAT SHE'S LIKE 
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD WARN MY MUM ABOUT THE ATMOS IN HER CAR 
BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY 
THERE'S A CHANCE IN THE STORY FOR COMPANIONS OF OLD TO TALK TO NEW COMPANIONS 
DONNA DO THEY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE 
YOUR FAMILY I MEAN THAT YOU'RE TRAVELLING WITH THE DOCTOR 
NOT REALLY 
WHEN MARTHA SAYS YOU'VE GOT TO 
BE CAREFUL I SUPPOSE IT'S JUST LIKE 
THIS LIGHTNING BOLT OF OH YEAH THERE'S MY FAMILY BACK HOME 
I DIDN'T TELL MY FAMILY 
KEPT IT ALL SO SECRET 
IT ALMOST DESTROYED THEM 
IN WHAT WAY 
THEY ENDED UP IMPRISONED THEY WERE TORTURED 
SHE'S NOT SAYING TO DONNA RUN FOR THE HILLS HE'S REALLY A NIGHTMARE 
AT ALL SHE'S JUST SAYING BEAR IN MIND THAT FOR ALL THE MAGNIFICENCE 
THAT YOU WILL EXPERIENCE THERE IS AN EQUAL BALANCE OF PAIN 
THAT MIGHT GO WITH IT 
STAND TOO CLOSE AND PEOPLE GET BURNT 
AND SO THAT'S WHEN MARTHA REALLY COMES INTO HER OWN 
THAT SORT OF MORAL COMPASS SHE HAS THAT CONSCIENCE 
TO PUSH A VERY STRONG WOMAN TO PUSH DONNA IN TO DOING THE RIGHT THING 
OH JUST IN TIME COME ON WE'RE GOING TO THE COUNTRY 
FRESH AIR AND GENIUSES WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK 
I'M NOT COMING WITH YOU 
I'VE BEEN THINKING I'M SORRY 
I'M GOING HOME 
REALLY 
THE DOCTOR CARRIES A LOT OF GUILT WITH HIM ABOUT SO MANY THINGS 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH HIS OWN PEOPLE AND ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH 
EVERYONE WHO COMES CLOSE TO HIM HE BURNS SO BRIGHTLY 
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT AND HE'S GOT TO LIVE WITH 
WHAT HE DOES TO OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES 
AND I THINK IT DOES PLAGUE HIM AT TIMES 
YOU'VE SAVED MY LIFE IN SO MANY WAYS 
YOU'RE 
I LOVE HIS ASSUMPTION THAT 
HE'S THE CENTRE OF EVERY DECISION DONNA MAKES THAT'S ON A BIG SCALE 
AND IT'S LIKE SHE BRINGS HIM RIGHT BACK DOWN TO EARTH JUST BREAKS HIM 
IT'S A GREAT MOMENT OF DONNA UNDERCUTTING THE DOCTOR 
WHICH IS WHAT SHE DOES SO BRILLIANTLY 
YOU'RE JUST POPPING HOME FOR A VISIT THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN 
YOU DUMBO 
AND THEN YOU'RE COMING BACK 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE A GREAT BIG OUTER SPACE DUNCE 
YEAH READY WHEN YOU ARE SIR 
SHE TRUSTS HIM IMPLICITLY 
COME ON 
SHE'S MADE THIS HUGE LEAP 
OF FAITH AND AND IS JUST LOVING EVERY MINUTE OF IT 
WE SHOULD HEAD BACK 
THERE'S NOT MUCH DOWN HERE 
IT SHOULD BE JUST BOILER ROOMS GENERATORS 
AYE AYE 
BUT WHAT IS DOWN THERE SPELLS DOUBLE TROUBLE 
AND IT'S IN THE SHAPE OF A SONTARAN CLONING ROOM 
FOR THE CLOSING SCENES WE WENT TO AN OLD SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER FACTORY 
SO THE BIG SILVER VATS YOU SEE ARE WHERE I THINK THEY USED TO 
PUT THEIR SHAMPOO AND KIND OF DELIVER IT INTO SMALLER POTS ETC 
WE ALWAYS TRY TO BE 
ECONOMIC AND RECYCLE OUR PROPS ESPECIALLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONES 
THE CLONING TANK I BELIEVE WAS PART OF THE POMPEII SET 
WHICH IS EPISODE TWO 
OH NOW THAT'S DIFFERENT 
OBVIOUSLY WE UPDATED IT BY A COUPLE OF THOUSAND YEARS 
THE BRIEF WAS TO CREATE A SORT OF SLURRY A KIND OF REALLY THICK WATER 
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT STUFF 
AND IT'S MADE OF MANY DIFFERENT MATERIALS 
BUT ALL SAFE MATERIALS SUCH AS A FOOD ADDITIVE 
WHICH YOU FIND IN YOUR MILKSHAKES AND STUFF 
GOD IT STINKS 
WE USED CHILDREN'S POWDER PAINT 
AND WE USED GLYCERINE AS WELL TO FORM A BARRIER 
SO THAT NONE OF THE PAINT ACTUALLY GETS ON TO THE ARTIST'S SKIN 
YOU CAN EAT IT 
I MEAN IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE TO 
IT'S ALL EDIBLE 
SO WE'VE GOT A POOL HEATER JUST TO TAKE THE CHILL OFF 
BECAUSE IT IS BLOOMING FREEZING 
WOOH 
OH 
CUE CAMERA 
AND ACTION 
IT'S A CLASSIC DOCTOR WHO SPOOKY SEQUENCE OF GOING INTO A DARK ROOM 
WHAT THE HELL 
DISCOVERING A TANK THERE'S A KNOCKING INSIDE 
OPENING IT AND REVEALING THE MONSTER 
I HOPE EVERYONE'S EXPECTING SOMETHING SONTARAN IN THERE AND IT'S NOT 
IT'S THIS GREAT BIG WEIRD 
MYSTERIOUS VILE CLONE IN ALL THE GREEN GLOOP 
IDENTIFY YOURSELF IDENTIFY 
I THINK THAT CLONE IS VILE ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S ONE OF OUR SCARIEST MONSTERS IT'S THE MOUTH 
WE TALKED ABOUT A HALF FORMED CREATURE TO BE ABSOLUTELY HONEST 
WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY FOR THAT CREATURE BECAUSE ALL THE MONEY HAD GONE ON SONTARANS 
WELL DON'T GET TOO CLOSE 
I THINK IT'S HARMLESS 
IT'S FUNNY ONE OF THE THE SIMPLEST THINGS ENDS UP AS ONE OF THE MOST 
GRUESOME THINGS OF ALL I LOVE THAT CLONE 
I DON'T EVEN THINK IT IS PROPERLY ALIVE 
CUT AND WE CUT THERE THANK YOU 
SO WE HAD TO LOOK FOR SOMEBODY ACTUALLY WHO 
COULD COPE WITH THE CLAUSTROPHOBIA OF HAVING THIS PROSTHETIC RIGHT OVER 
THEIR FACE MOUTH AND NOSE AND GO UNDER THE GLOOP 
RUARI WE'RE DOING THE SAME ACTION WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SHOTS NOW 
THEN WE'RE DONE FANTASTIC 
THE PROSTHETIC TOOK ABOUT TWO HOURS TO PUT ON 
SO YOU NEEDED SOMEBODY QUITE ZEN 
AND RUARI MEARS IS SOMEBODY THAT 
IS ONE OF OUR REGULAR MAIN MONSTER CREATURE GUYS 
AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM VERY WELL FROM CYBERMEN BEING A CYBERMAN 
RUARI IT'S DANNY ALL RIGHT DAN HOW ARE YOU DOING 
YEAH COOL MAN SO YOU'VE BEEN IN THERE BEFORE 
WITH THAT MASK ON DO YOU STILL FEEL CONFIDENT 
OH YEAH YEAH NO PROBLEM NO PROBLEM AT ALL 
IT COMPLETELY COVERS ALL OF YOUR HEAD AND YOUR EARS AND YOUR NOSE 
THE ONLY HOLES BEING A FEW LITTLE 
HOLES FOR THE MOUTH AND FOR YOUR NOSE SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY BREATHE 
CAN YOU ACTUALLY OPEN YOUR MOUTH 
YEAH I CAN 
LOVELY 
IT'S A BIT LIKE SENSORY DEPRIVATION SO YOU CAN IMAGINE 
IT'S QUITE COMFORTABLE 
YOU'RE SITTING THERE IT'S EASY TO JUST CHILL OUT BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T 
GOT ALL OF THE OTHER SENSES AROUND YOU DISTRACTING YOU ABOUT THINGS 
SO YOU JUST ZONE OUT 
IS SOMEONE IN THERE 
HELLO 
THE OTHER THING IS BECAUSE 
IN LIQUID YOU LOSE THREE TIMES AS FAST YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE 
HE DID GET COLD QUITE QUICKLY SO WE HAD TO KEEP BRINGING HIM IN AND OUT 
HIS MOUTH WAS A KIND OF LATEX THING 
SO HE HAD VERY RESTRICTED USE 
SO HE COULDN'T EAT HE COULD ONLY DRINK THROUGH A STRAW 
IF YOU COULD OPEN YOUR HAND NOW I'M RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU 
YOU CAN FEEL MY FACE HERE YEAH 
THAT'S THE SHAPE THAT YOU GO WITH YOUR HAND 
IF YOU GO THIS WAY THE CHANCES ARE 
YOU MIGHT POKE HIM IN THE EYES IF YOU COME FLAT HANDED 
PALM FLAT O. K. 
THEN THERE'S NO CHANCE OF ANY DAMAGE TO HIM HAPPENING WHICH I'M SURE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO DO ANYWAY 
OF COURSE NOT EVERYTHING YOU HAVE TO DO YOU HAVE TO BE GUIDED 
WALKING AROUND EVERYWHERE TAKEN HERE TAKEN THERE 
RUARI IT'S A LOT WARMER 
EXCELLENT AND THEN HAVING SOMEONE DESCRIBE 
THE SPACE I'M IN TO THEN INTERACT 
WITH IT WITH THE VISUALISATION I HAVE BUILT UP IN MY OWN MIND 
GUIDE HIM ROUND FOLKS 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING IN THAT SIDE 
I KNEW HE WOULD BE O. K. WITH THE CLAUSTROPHOBIA 
ALSO WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO 
WAX EVERYTHING ON WHOEVER WAS GOING TO DO IT 
SO HANDS ARMS CHEST HEAD 
FULL SHAVE FROM THE WAIST UP 
RUARI I KIND OF KNEW WOULDN'T MIND BEING WAXED 
TO GO WITH HIS PIERCINGS 
I'VE GOT IT 
YEAH WELL DONE MATE 
YOU'RE SAT NEARLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BATH AT THE MOMENT 
O. K. 
THE MONITORS ARE BEHIND YOU AND THE CAMERAS ARE IN FRONT OF YOU 
RIGHTY OH 
RUARI SIT UP FOR ME AS IF YOU ARE SITTING UP IN THE SCENE 
LIFT UP YOUR LEFT ARM AND HAND DIRECTLY TO YOUR SIDE 
KEEP GOING HIGHER AND BACKWARDS SO IT'S THERE 
O. K. CAN YOU FEEL THE SHAPE THAT YOU'RE IN THERE 
YEAH YEAH 
BRING YOUR HAND A BIT HIGHER PLEASE RUARI 
THAT'S WHERE HIS FACE IS THERE O. K. 
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS FOR YOU TO DO 
A RISE UP AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND THAT POSITION WHERE HIS FACE IS 
SO DOWN YOU GO 
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO COMPLETELY 
UNDER BUT IT'S UP TO YOU YOU BE READY TO BACK AWAY A LITTLE BIT 
BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE IF HE'S READY 
O. K. FEEL IT AND THAT WOULD HAVE DONE IT 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT 
O. K. FOR RUARI'S SAKE I'M GOING TO GO STRAIGHT AWAY GUYS 
GET READY RUARI ARE YOU READY 
AND ACTION 
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT STUFF 
IDENTIFY YOURSELF 
O. K. STOP THERE 
MISSED MY FACE 
YEAH YEAH HOW FAR OUT WAS I 
NOT FAR AT ALL 
YOU WERE NEARLY THERE 
TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT TO MY LEFT OR RIGHT 
A BIT MORE YOUR LEFT MORE TO MY LEFT 
THIS WAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I AM I'M HERE 
RIGHT 
FINDING THE MARK WITH MY HAND WAS QUITE DIFFICULT 
IT IS LITERALLY A MATTER OF CONFIDENCE YOU PUT YOUR 
HAND INTO THE POSITION WHERE THEY WANT THE END POSITION TO BE 
AND THEN YOU VISUALISE THE SPACE AND REMEMBER WHERE IT IS AND JUST PUT YOUR HAND THERE 
IDENTIFY YOURSELF 
NOT TOO SLOWLY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE ACTOR NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO REACT TO IT 
AH AH 
BUT THEN NOT SO FAST THAT I'M GOING TO KNOCK HIM OUT 
THAT WAS CHALLENGING 
I'VE GOT A NOSE BLEED HE PUT HIS FINGER RIGHT UP MY NOSE 
I'M SORRY IT'S ALL RIGHT IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT 
YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT CONFIDENTLY AND HOPE YOU GET IT RIGHT 
IDENTIFY 
DECLARING ABSOLUTE EMERGENCY SIR REPEAT ABSOLUTE EMERGENCY OVER 
CAN YOU HEAR ME 
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND ME 
WELL DON'T GET TOO CLOSE 
I THINK IT'S HARMLESS 
I DON'T EVEN THINK IT'S PROPERLY ALIVE 
RIGHT RUARI 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GET HIM OUT PLEASE 
GET RUARI OUT PLEASE 
DO YOU WANT TO COME OVER TOWARDS ME RUARI ALL RIGHT THERE 
I'VE NEVER BEEN SUBMERGED IN GOO BEFORE 
WHICH WAS QUITE ENTERTAINING 
NOT ONE TO DO AGAIN 
NO I'D DO IT AGAIN 
IT WAS THE FULL BODY WAX THAT WAS THE BIT THAT I WOULDN'T BE 
TOO ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT DOING TOO SOON AGAIN 
THEY GOO BIT THAT WAS GREAT I ENJOYED IT NICE ONE 
AND ACTION 
SOMEONE'S GROWING A BODY 
A HUMAN BODY 
EXCELLENT SKILLS OF DEDUCTION 
THEN THE SONTARAN ARRIVES THEN YOU GET THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM 
I WOULD RATE YOU ABOVE AVERAGE SOLDIER WELL DONE 
WHEREAS YOU YOU SMELL OF SWEAT AND FEAR 
IN TERMS OF GETTING THE SONTARANS BACK 
THEY'RE A CLASSIC DOCTOR WHO MONSTER 
THEY WERE ALWAYS ON MY LIST I LOVED THEM I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THEM 
I AM GROUP MARSHAL STIKE 
COMMANDER OF THE NINTH SONTARAN BATTLE GROUP 
LAST TIME THE SONTARAN WAS ON SCREEN WAS EIGHTY FOUR TO EIGHTY FIVE 
IN A STORY CALLED THE TWO DOCTORS 
SNAP 
WHERE THEY WENT TO SPAIN BIZARRELY 
COLIN BAKER AND PATRICK TROUGHTON ENDED UP FIGHTING THE SONTARANS IN 
SPAIN NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT 
AND THIS IS THEIR FIRST RETURN SINCE THEN 
WHO ARE YOU INDEED KNOW YOUR ENEMY 
THE MAIN THING RUSSELL SAID ABOUT 
SONTARANS AND A SONTARAN STORY WAS MILITARY 
I AM GENERAL STARL OF THE TENTH SONTARAN BATTLE FLEET 
KNOWN AS STARL THE UNDEFEATED 
THAT WAS THE KEY WORD FOR THE 
EPISODES IN THE TONE MEETING MILITARY 
WE FILMED THE SCENES TODAY 
AFTER WE'VE BEEN TAKEN OVER AND HYPNOTISED BY 
THE SONTARANS SO THERE'S LOTS OF BLANK FACE ACTING GOING ON 
YOU STILL KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BUT YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR ACTIONS 
WHAT'S HE DOING DOWN HERE 
HE ASKED TO SEE YOU 
WHY HAS HE FOUND SOMETHING 
WE CAN STILL HEAR HER WE CAN STILL RESPOND TO HER 
BUT WE'RE JUST NOT IN CONTROL OF WHAT WE DO IT'S THAT CLASSIC 
KIND OF MOTION 
IT'S QUITE SCARY REALLY IT IS QUITE SCARY 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME I HAVE 
SEEN A SONTARAN AS WELL THAT WAS AN EXPERIENCE 
HI DAN HELLO HOW ARE YOU DOING ALL RIGHT THANKS 
HOW'S IT FEELING BEING A SONTARAN 
YES YES IT'S VERY NICE IT'S VERY WARM LATEX BALACLAVA 
YEAH I'VE HEARD IT MAKES YOU GO A BIT DEAF 
YEAH YEAH 
SONTARANS ARE A CLONED RACE 
IN THE PAST IN DOCTOR WHO WE'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN THEM CLONING 
I THINK THAT'S A VERY SONTARAN ATTRIBUTE TO CLONE 
DEDICATED TO A LIFE OF WARFARE 
A CLONE RACE GROWN IN BATCHES OF MILLIONS 
IT WAS IRRESISTIBLE WE'VE GOT SONTARANS THEY CLONE 
WE'VE GOT MARTHA COMING BACK OH LET'S HAVE THE EVIL COMPANION 
LET'S HAVE THE EVIL DOUBLE OF MARTHA ONCE ALL THAT STARTED 
TO CLICK INTO PLACE THE WHOLE STORY CLICKED INTO PLACE 
AND ACTION 
WHEN MARTHA FIRST GETS CAUGHT IF YOU LIKE I DID HAVE A FEELING THAT 
AFTER EVERYTHING SHE'S BEEN THROUGH HOW DID SHE NOT SEE 
THAT ONE COMING WHEN THOSE TWO GUYS TAKE HER INTO THAT ROOM 
IT'S THESE TWO SOLDIERS THAT SHE'S PROBABLY NEVER HAD 
MUCH OF A DIALOGUE WITH 
THAT SHED A BIT OF LIGHT FOR ME ON HOW HER CHARACTER IS AT THE MOMENT 
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT THAT CYNICAL ABOUT EVERYTHING AND SHE'S NOT 
THAT TAINTED THAT SHE SUSPECTS ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY ALL THE TIME 
SHE CAN STILL TRUST ENOUGH TO LET HER GUARD DOWN A BIT 
BUT SHE DOES AND SHE KIND OF GETS IN TROUBLE 
CUT 
ALSO YOU WANT TO DO MORE WITH HER YOU WANT FREEDOM TO HAVE FUN 
AND BY PLAYING EVIL WOMAN RISING OUT OF TANK 
CLONE 
IT'S GOOD FUN 
YOU CAN'T 
CUT VERY GOOD THANK YOU 
TO FILM THESE SYRUPY SCENES THE TEAM NEEDED A PHOTOFIT FREEMA 
WE WERE VERY LUCKY IN FINDING THIS LADY WHO LIVES JUST IN 
NEWPORT ACTUALLY WHO HAS WORKED WITH US A COUPLE OF TIMES BEFORE 
HER SKIN TONE IS VERY SIMILAR TO FREEMA 
WE PUT A WIG ON AND BODY WISE SHE'S VERY SIMILAR AS WELL 
I GOT INTO THE TANK OF GLOOP FOR THAT SCENE 
AND ALSO THE LADY PLAYING MY DOUBLE GOT INTO THE TANK OF GLOOP 
O. K. GET READY 
SHE GOT IN THERE FIRST AND IT WAS ALL THE BACK OF HEAD SHOTS 
ACTION MARIAN 
I COULD DO ANYTHING 
IF I WERE YOU 
I WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING 
YOU CAN'T 
THAT WAS QUITE HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU CAN LEARN FROM OTHER PEOPLE 
WHEN YOU SEE IT DONE FIRST AND THE ADVICE THAT PEOPLE GAVE 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY 
BE SUBMERGED IN THE GLOOP AND THEN RISE UP OUT OF IT 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT TAKE ONE GAS ON PLEASE 
IT WAS TEPID AND IT WAS VERY SLIMY I'VE NEVER BEEN 
I WAS NEVER A CHILD OR AN ADULT THAT LIKES TO SLOP ABOUT IN MUD 
SO I WAS ALL VERY LIKE OH THIS IS REALLY SLIMY 
ARE YOU READY FREEMA 
YES CAMERA'S RUNNING AND IN YOUR OWN TIME ACTION 
AND AS I WENT UNDER AND CAME UP 
I BREATHED IN AND OUT AT THE WRONG TIME 
AND IT WAS ALL GOING UP MY NOSE 
IN THAT SCENE WHEN I'M SITTING UP I'M SWALLOWING PROFUSELY BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GAG 
AND I WAS REALLY STRUGGLING BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF THAT REGISTERED 
SO THEY WERE HAPPY WITH IT IN ONE 
CUT THERE 
ACE IN THE HOLE 
AND IT TOOK AGES TO WASH THAT OUT OF MY HAIR AS WELL 
I THINK THE MOST POWERFUL SPECIAL EFFECTS WEAPON THAT WE'VE GOT IN 
ALL OF TELEVISION IS THE CUT I USED THAT A LOT IN THAT SEQUENCE 
JUST TO MAKE IT FEEL LIKE THERE WAS TWO FREEMAS 
SO THE LITTLE TRICKS OF FLICKING ONE'S HAIR OUT OF THE 
COLLAR WHICH ONE CAN GET TO DO BEHIND AND BEGIN THE PROCESS OF 
THE PERSON WHO IS THE DOUBLE 
AND THEN SWAP THEM ROUND FOR THE REVERSE 
READY AND WAITING TO ADVANCE THE GREAT SONTARAN CAUSE SIR 
THE DIRECTOR DOUGLAS WAS VERY CLEAR AND VERY CLEVER ABOUT 
WHERE HE KNEW HE WANTED TO CUT TO MAKE THAT WORK 
READY AND WAITING TO ADVANCE THE GREAT SONTARAN CAUSE SIR 
THEN GO TO WORK 
THE IDEA OF HAVING A CLONE MARTHA 
WAS BORN OUT OF THE STRUGGLE TO MAKE SURE WRITING MARTHA AS OLDER 
AND INDEPENDENT DIDN'T MEAN WE WROTE HER AS A COLD CHARACTER 
SO ACTUALLY BY EMBRACING THAT RATHER THAN TRYING TO IGNORE THE PROBLEM 
WE DID CREATE AN ANTI MARTHA 
NOW WE BEGIN 
ALL OF THE BAD THINGS THAT MARTHA COULD HAVE BECOME INCREDIBLY 
INTELLIGENT INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE BUT BAD 
CODE RED SONTARAN GOTCHA 
DOCTOR JONES 
FOUND ANYTHING YET 
NO SIR NOTHING TO REPORT 
THE DOCTOR WHO CAST AND CREW 
HAVE DESCENDED ON A QUIET SUBURBAN CARDIFF STREET 
ACTION 
BUT INVADING A COMMUNITY'S TIME 
AND SPACE NATURALLY DRAWS SOME CURIOSITY 
WITH SECURITY KEEPING THE CROWDS AT BAY THE GOOD DOCTOR LENDS A HAND 
WE ALSO GET A LOT OF HELP FROM THE ACTORS IN THAT THEY GO AND TALK TO 
THE BYSTANDERS AND DO AUTOGRAPHS AND STUFF LIKE THAT THAT'S A BIG HELP 
ARE YOU OLIVIA 
BECAUSE THE ACTION WE WERE DOING DIDN'T ACTUALLY REQUIRE FULL CONTROL OF THE ROAD WE HAD POLICE AND OUR 
OWN SECURITY PEOPLE AND WE ASKED PEOPLE JUST TO 
STOP WHILE WE GO FOR A TAKE 
THE DAY STARTS WITH A SMALL EXPLOSION UNDER THE BONNET OF A CAR 
YOU'VE JUST GOT LIKE A SPARK IT'LL JUST BE LIKE A SHOWER OF SPARKS 
SORT OF HERE ALL RIGHT AND THEN YOU CAN REACT TO IT OR WHATEVER 
IT'S JUST LIKE A. 
A PUFF OF SMOKE AND THEN IT WILL ALL JUST GO AWAY

WILF SIR WILFRED MOTT

YOU MUST BE ONE OF THEM ALIENS

HIS LIFE AGAIN THROUGH HER IN A WAY HE LOVES HER VERY VERY MUCH 
TO HAVE SOMEONE AT HOME 
WHO HAS FAITH HOPE AND TRUST IN THE DOCTOR IS A VERY POWERFUL THING

YOU DON'T GO HOME FOR A BIT OF SOAP OPERA AND SAY HOW ARE YOU MUM 
AND HAVE A NICE TIME AND A CUP OF TEA THAT'S WHAT LIFE WITH THE DOCTOR IS 
IF YOU'RE WITH THE DOCTOR THEN TROUBLE IS NOT FAR BEHIND 
AND TWO MINUTES LATER SURE ENOUGH 
WILF IS TRAPPED IN A CAR WHILE ALL THE ATMOS SYSTEMS 
SET OFF THE WHOLE WORLD IS IN DANGER AND HE'S CHOKING TO DEATH 
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU'RE CONNECTED TO THE DOCTOR
