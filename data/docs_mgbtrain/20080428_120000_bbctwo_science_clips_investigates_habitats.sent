HOW DO WE KNOW WHEN SPRING IS HERE 
WHEN DOES IT ARRIVE IS IT GETTING EARLIER AS SOME PEOPLE THINK 
T. V. PRESENTER KATE HUMBLE VISITED THE CHILTERN HILLS IN BUCKINGHAMSHIRE 
CLOSE TO WHERE SHE GREW UP 
SHE'S BACK TO LOOK FOR SIGNS OF SPRING 
THE BEECH WOODS ARE PARTICULARLY BEAUTIFUL ROUND HERE 
AND THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SIGNS THAT SPRING IS DEFINITELY 
ON ITS WAY THESE NEW REALLY SOFT VIVID GREEN BEECH LEAVES 
JUST BEGINNING TO EMERGE 
I LOVE THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE STILL PRETTY LEAFLESS TREES 
THAT STILL LOOK GREY AND SKELETAL 
AND THE UNBELIEVABLY RICH ALIVE GREEN OF THE WOODLAND FLOOR 
THAT SEEMS TO JUST HAPPEN OVERNIGHT LIKE A MIRACLE 
ISN'T IT WEIRD 
HOW SMELLS CAN JUST MAKE MEMORIES FLOOD BACK 
I'M SITTING HERE AND I FEEL LIKE A TEN YEAR OLD AGAIN 
THIS LOVELY EARTHY MULCHY SMELL OF DEAD LEAVES AND THERE'S SORT OF 
THE ASTRINGENT FRESH SMELL OF PINE AND THEN 
I DON'T KNOW QUITE HOW TO DESCRIBE IT BUT IT'S THE SMELL OF GREEN 
IN THE EARLY SPRING 
THEN CUCKOO FLOWERS A LITTLE BIT LATER 
AND I CAN REMEMBER BEING SO EXCITED EVERY YEAR 
THE FIRST TIME I SAW A BUTTERFLY OR A LADYBIRD 
AND I CAN REMEMBER ALL THESE LITTLE DETAILS 
ALL THESE THINGS TRIGGERING OFF IN MY HEAD BUT WHAT I CAN'T REALLY 
PUT MY HAND ON MY HEART AND SAY IS 
THAT IT IS HAPPENING EARLIER IN THE YEAR THAN IT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED COMING HERE 
IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO RELY ON MEMORY 
THEN HOW MIGHT WE INVESTIGATE IF SPRING IS COMING ANY EARLIER 
YOU NEED TO OBSERVE AND WRITE DOWN 
WHEN THE FIRST SIGNS OF SPRING APPEARED OVER MANY YEARS THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT RICHARD FITTER DID 
RICHARD THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY RECORD AMAZING RECORD 
WHY DID YOU DO IT WHY DID YOU START 
BECAUSE I'M AN INVETERATE MAKER OF LISTS OF ALL KINDS 
BUT ARE YOU A SCIENTIST NO NO I WAS AN ECONOMIST BY TRAINING 
BUT I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN NATURE AND WILDLIFE SINCE I CAN REMEMBER 
SO HOW DID YOU GO ABOUT KEEPING THESE VERY COMPREHENSIVE LISTS OF SPECIES 
WELL I NOTICED THE THE WILDFLOWERS 
THE DATES THEY CAME INTO FLOWER AND I KEPT RECORDS 
OF BIRDS' NESTS OF BIRDS SINGING 
OF BUTTERFLIES WHEN THEY APPEARED 
ALMOST ANYTHING I COULD MAKE A LIST OF I MEAN 
THIS IS HOW I DID IT FOR PLANTS FOR THE YEAR NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE 
IT WAS MADE WHEN I WAS LIVING AT CHEDDAR 
AND I BELIEVE YOU WERE THERE AT THAT TIME PROBABLY GETTING UNDER YOUR FEET HOW AMAZING 
WHEN DID YOU REALISE THAT THIS DATA WAS IMPORTANT TO SCIENCE NOT JUST A FUN LIST THAT WAS DUE TO MY SON 
ALASDAIR HE'S A BIOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF YORK 
HE KNEW THAT I WAS KEEPING THESE RECORDS AND HE REALISED 
THAT THEY MIGHT BE OF IMPORTANCE IN CLIMATE CHANGE STUDIES 
AND WOULD YOU SAY ONCE ALASDAIR HAD ALERTED YOU TO THE FACT 
THAT LOOKING BACK OVER THIS TIME THAT SPRING HAS CHANGED 
OVER THE TIME YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING THESE RECORDS THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT 
FLOWERS ARE FLOWERING EARLIER 
BIRDS ARE ARRIVING EARLIER IN THE SPRING SOME ARE NESTING EARLIER 
THERE'S A GENERAL ADVANCE OF A WEEK OR TEN DAYS 
OVER WHAT IT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO 
RICHARD IT'S BEEN A HUGE PLEASURE TO MEET YOU THINK VERY VERY MUCH 
AND THANK YOU TOO FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT COLLECTION OF DATA 
WHICH HAS ADDED SO MUCH TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CLIMATE CHANGE OH 
RIBBET RIBBET 
SPRING 
IT DOESN'T ARRIVE AT THE SAME TIME OVER THE WHOLE UNITED KINGDOM 
SOME PLACES GET THEIR FIRST SIGNS EARLIER THAN OTHERS 
TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHEN AND WHERE SPRING ARRIVED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
B. B. C. SPRINGWATCH CARRIED OUT A NATIONWIDE SURVEY 
BACK IN JANUARY WE TEAMED UP WITH THE WOODLAND TRUST 
AND WE LAUNCHED THE SPRINGWATCH SURVEY WHAT WE ASKED YOU TO DO 
WAS TO LOOK OUT FOR FROGSPAWN 
SEVEN SPOT LADYBIRDS AND RECORD YOUR SIGHTINGS ON OUR WEBSITE 
OR BY SENDING IN A POSTCARD WE'VE HAD FIFTY THOUSAND SIGHTINGS 
RECORDED AND INCORPORATED INTO THE WEB 
B. B. C. SPRINGWATCH USE A WEBSITE AS IT'S EASY FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO ACCESS 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE RECORDED WHERE AND WHEN THEY HAD THEIR SIGHTINGS 
AND THEIR DATA WAS DISPLAYED ON A MAP FIRST FROGSPAWN 
EACH DOT REPRESENTS ONE SIGHTING 
IT APPEARS ON THE MAP WHERE AND WHEN IT WAS SEEN 
IT COMES IN ON THE SOUTH WEST 
THERE'S MY GARDEN YEAH THE SOUTH WEST 
ROUND THE COAST WHERE IT TENDS TO BE MILDER 
THEN FAR LESS RECORDS 
WHAT COULD THAT BE WAS THAT THE COLD SNAP WE HAD 
YOU GOT IT 
EITHER PEOPLE WERE SO COLD THEY COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO GO OUT 
OR MORE LIKELY THERE WERE NO FROGS DOING ANYTHING 
BUT HERE ABOUT WHERE WE ARE NOW 
THE WEATHER GETS WARMER 
FROGSPAWN ALL OVER THE PLACE 
WAS SPOTTED ACTUALLY IN SCOTLAND WHICH IS VERY BIZARRE 
AS YOU WOULD EXPECT MOST OF THE SIGHTINGS IN URBAN AREAS 
I LIKE THE IDEA OF MOST LADYBIRDS ARE SPOTTED 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
SAME SORT OF TREND 
LADYBIRDS STARTING DOWN THE SOUTH WEST 
AS YOU'D EXPECT THAT'S THE WAY SPRING MOVES 
WHY DO YOU THINK SPRING ARRIVES IN THE SOUTH WEST FIRST 
OTHER SIGNS OF SPRING THE PUBLIC WERE ASKED TO LOOK OUT FOR WERE 
BUMBLEBEES 
SWIFTS RETURNING FROM SPENDING THE WINTER IN AFRICA 
AND THE HAWTHORN BLOSSOM 
EVENTUALLY NEARLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND RECORDS WERE SUBMITTED 
WHICH PROVIDED A DETAILED PICTURE OF SPRING TWO THOUSAND FIVE ACROSS THE U. K. 
SO HOW WILL THIS DATA BE USED 
TIM SPARKS EXPLAINS 
THIS DATA YOU'VE LOOKED AT ALL OUR FINDINGS 
WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU 
WE'VE SEEN A WHOLE RUN OF VERY EARLY YEARS 
THE FROG SPAWNING RECORDS YOU'VE SEEN NOTHING UNUSUAL BUT THEY DO CONFIRM WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING 
PARTICULARLY THAT DROP IN NUMBERS AFTER THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY WHEN IT GOT COLD EXACTLY AS WE EXPECT 
WHAT D'YOU DO WITH ALL THIS DATA ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING OUT AND COLLECTING THIS DATA FOR YOU 
HOW WILL IT HELP US MY MAIN INTEREST IS IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW IT AFFECTS WILDLIFE 
AND WITH INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS FROGS FOR EXAMPLE THEY RESPOND BEAUTIFULLY TO TEMPERATURE 
WE KNOW THEY DO SO THAT IN THE LONG RUN IF IT'S GETTING WARMER THEY'LL BECOME ACTIVE EARLIER 
WE CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH INFORMATION NO OVER A LONG PERIOD AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS 
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT NATURE IS SO COMPLICATED WE'LL NEVER KNOW IT ALL IT'S A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA 
THE BIGGEST RECORD EVER 
AND IT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY USEFUL 
AND THIS DATA CAN CONTINUE TO GROW 
AS NEW SURVEYS ARE CARRIED OUT EVERY SPRING
