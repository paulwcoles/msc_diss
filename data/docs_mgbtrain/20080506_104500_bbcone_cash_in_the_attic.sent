BUT THE NAME ON THE BOTTOM SWAROVSKI 
WELCOME TO CASH IN THE ATTIC 
PROGRAMME THAT HELPS YOU SEARCH OUT THOSE HIDDEN TREASURES IN YOUR HOME AND THEN SELL THEM AT AUCTION 
TODAY I'M IN NORTH LONDON AND I STOPPED OFF TO ENJOY THIS RATHER SPLENDID GEORGIAN COUNTRY HOUSE 
HENDON HALL WAS BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SIX AND IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN THE HOM OF DAVID GARRICK 
THE FAMOUS EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ACTOR AND MANAGER OF THE THEATRE ROYAL DRURY LANE 
AFTER A NUMBER OF YEARS AS A SCHOOL THE HALL WAS TURNED INTO A LUXURY HOTEL 
AND IT WAS HERE THAT THE ENGLAND FOOTBALL SQUAD STAYED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX THE NIGHT BEFORE WINNING THE WORLD CUP 
WELL LET'S HOPE WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND ANTIQUES AND COLLECTABLES 
WHICH WILL GIVE A STAR PERFORMANCE WHEN THEY GO UNDER THE HAMMER AT AUCTION 
TODAY ON CASH IN THE ATTIC IT'S FAMILY AFFAIR WHAT A TEAM MOTHER AND DAUGHTER ALREADY HARD AT WORK 
WITH GIRLS WHO AREN'T AFRAID TO SPEAK THEIR MIND 
I THINK IT'S WORTH A LOT MORE FIFTY QUID 
I KNOW WHAT SWAROVSKI CRYSTALS COST IF YOU HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING 
AT THE AUCTION JONTY IS ALMOST LOST FOR WORDS 
FIVE HUNDRED MY WORD 
FIND OUT WHY WHEN TODAY'S COLLECTABLES GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
I'M OFF TO MEET A FASHION CONSCIOUS 
HARD WORKING MOTHER AND DAUGHTER WHO'VE CALLED IN THE TEAM 
TO HELP THEM RAISE MONEY BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S TIME THEY HAD A BIT OF PAMPERING 
CHRISTINE AND HER DAUGHTER JO HAVE COLLECTED MANY ANTIQUES OVER THE YEARS 
NOW THEIR HOME IS PACKED WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF ITEMS SO IT SHOULD BE A VERY INTERESTING DAY 
MORNING JONTY 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE A BIT TALLER THAN YOU FOR A CHANGE 
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU LOOKING REALLY DAPPER TODAY BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO MEET TWO LADIES WHO ARE DESIGNERS 
GOOD I HOPE THEY'VE GOT SOME STYLISH ANTIQUES I'M SURE THEY WILL LET'S SEE WHAT THEY'VE GOT 
CHRISTINE JO WHAT A TEAM MOTHER AND DAUGHTER 
ALREADY HARD AT WORK SO WHY HAVE YOU CALLED IN CASH IN THE ATTIC 
I'D LIKE TO DECLUTTER BECAUSE I HAVE SO MUCH STUFF I'M GETTING TOO OLD FOR DUSTING EVERY DAY 
HAVE YOU EARMARKED SOME STUFF 
THE THINGS I LIKE HAVE BEEN PUT AWAY BUT THERE ARE SOME NICE BITS THAT CAN STILL GO 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY ON 
HEALTH FARM MASSAGE TREATMENTS 
BODY FACE THE LOT HAIR NAILS 
AND HOW MUCH DO YOU RECKON IT'LL COST 
IF WE GET FIVE HUNDRED I'LL BE HAPPY 
IT TAKES MORE THAN FINGERS CROSSED TO RAISE FIVE HUNDRED IT TAKES ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES AND LET'S GET TO WORK 
SO WHY DON'T WE DO JUST THAT ALL RIGHT LET'S GO 
CHRISTINE'S TREASURES WILL KEEP US BUSY RUMMAGING ALL DAY 
BUT TO BE SURE THE GIRLS ENJOY THEIR LUXURY PAMPERING EXPERIENCE WE HAVE TO MAKE FIVE HUNDRED 
JONTY'S THE FIRST TO FIND SOMETHING WORTH ADMIRING AMONGST A GLORIOUS COLLECTION OF GLASS 
JONTY CHRISTINE AND JO HI HI 
THAT'S A HANDSOME LOOKING JUG CHRISTINE 
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM I WAS ENGAGED TO A GUY THAT LASTED THREE DAYS FROM SUNDAY TO TUESDAY 
HE TOLD ME I COULD KEEP THE RING AND I THOUGHT I DON'T WANT TO WEAR HIS RING SO I TOOK IT TO THE SHOP 
I SAID I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY BUT I WANT TO TAKE GOODS TO THE VALUE OF THE RING 
THIS IS A CLARET JUG AND THEY USUALLY COME IN THIS STYLE 
THEY USUALLY HAVE A CUT GLASS BASE 
AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT YOU GET SILVERED TOPS TO THEM 
IN VARYING STYLES AND THAT IS HOW YOU CAN DATE THEM BY LOOKING AT THE DESIGN THEY'VE USED 
USUALLYB ON THE TOP 
LOOKING AT THE STYLE OF THIS THIS HAS A VERY NINETEENTH CENTURY FEEL 
BUT I BELIEVE IT JUST TO BE A BIT LATER THAN THAT 
I WOULD SUSPECT THAT THIS CLARET JUG WOULD BE MADE IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SILVER WE'RE LOOKING A FIGURE OF FORTY TO FIFTY MAYBE SIXTY 
IF IT'S GOING TO STOP ME POLISHING IT HAS TO GO 
IT'S A START THAT'S FOR SURE BUT I THINK YOUR PAMPERING IS 
GOING TO COST A BIT MORE THAN THAT SO LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN FIND 
ESTIMATED AT UP TO SIXTY THIS TRADITIONAL EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY SILVER PLATED CLARET JUG 
HAS GIVEN US A GREAT START 
WITH SO MANY ANTIQUES IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHERE TO START OR WHAT TO CHOOSE FROM 
SO LET'S HOPE WE'LL ENJOY THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS WITH JO'S FIRST DISCOVERY 
JONTY CHECK THIS OUT I BELIEVE THAT'S GOOD NAME 
LALIQUE PARIS LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NEVER BEEN USED I DOUBT IT HAS 
PERHAPS WE CAN GET IT OUT RENE LALIQUE WAS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL 
ART GLASS DESIGNERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
ORIGINALLY HE WAS DESIGNING JEWELLERY RIGHT 
BUT HE WAS THEN ASKED TO DESIGN SCENT BOTTLES 
SO HIS SIGNATURE LABEL IS THIS FROSTED OFTEN OPALESCENT GLASS 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK ON THE UNDERSIDE 
THIS IS ETCHED LALIQUE FRANCE ON THE UNDERSIDE THERE RIGHT 
YES SO THAT'S VERY NICE TO SEE 
GOOD 
IT'S GREAT WE HAVE THE BOX 
AND I SUPPOSE VALUE AT AUCTION WOULD BE I SUPPOSE BETWEEN FORTY TO SIXTY 
WILL MUM BE PLEASED WITH THAT I DOUBT IT 
RIGHT LET'S POP IT BACK IN THE BOX LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN FIND 
RENE LALIQUE DIED IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE BUT THE FIRM HE FOUNDED IS STILL ACTIVE TODAY 
SO I WONDER IF THIS LATTER DAY PIECE WILL ATTRACT INTEREST 
AS THE RUMMAGE CONTINUES JO SHOWS US THAT SHE'S ON THE BALL 
WITH TWO CARVED SOAPSTONE BUDDHAS 
THE LAUGHING BUDDHA SYMBOLISES LUCK AND GENEROSITY 
WILL HE BRING US GOOD FORTUNE 
DOWNSTAIRS I AM CURIOUS ABOUT MY NEXT FIND 
CHRISTINE IN YOUR WORK ROOM THERE IS THIS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL LUMP OF CRYSTAL 
BUT THE NAME ON THE BOTTOM SWAROVSKI 
IS A VERY IMPORTANT NAME IN THE CRYSTAL WORLD AND I BET JONTY KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THIS 
JONTY COME AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS 
THIS BEAUTIFUL LUMP OF CRYSTAL LOOK AT THE COLOUR IT'S QUITE EXTRAORDINARY ISN'T IT 
AND YES THE NAME SWAROVSKI ON THE UNDERSIDE 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST FACTORIES IN PRODUCTION TODAY SELLING GLASS 
AND IT WAS DANIEL SWAROVSKI WHO FOUNDED IT HE COMES FROM MODERN DAY CZECHOSLOVAKIA WHICH IS BOHEMIA 
WHICH IS WHERE ALL THAT WONDERFUL GLASS CAME FROM 
AND BECAUSE HE HAD A MARCH ON EVERYBODY ELSE HIS BUSINESS REALLY TOOK OFF 
AND IT'S GONE FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT IS WORTH JONTY 
IF I WAS TO LOOK INTO MY CRYSTAL BALL AND GIVE YOU A VALUE 
I SUPPOSE WE ARE LOOKING AT FIFTY TO SEVENTY I THINK IT'S WORTH A LOT MORE WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT 
THEY ARE VERY LIMITED EDITIONS AND IT WAS WORTH THEN THREE HUNDRED 
SO THIS IS SOMETHING YOU SERIOUSLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU TAKE IT YES 
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO THINK ABOUT THAT CHRISTINE YOU NEED TO PUT THAT AWAY SOMEWHERE SAFE 
AND WE'LL WAIT UNTIL AUCTION DAY 
IF IT'S NOT GOING TO COME TO AUCTION WE'LL HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER THINGS 
BACK TO WORK GUYS 
CHRISTINE CLEARLY LOVES HER GLASSWARE 
FIRST THE LALIQUE AND NOW THE SWAROVSKI ALSO DATING FROM THE EARLY SEVENTIES 
THEIR AGE LESS THAN FORTY YEARS OLD MAY EXPLAIN WHY THE ITEMS ARE WORTH 
LESS IN JONTY'S EYES THAN CHRISTINE WAS HOPING FOR 
HERE'S HOPING THESE THREE STRIKING GLASS ORNAMENTS WILL HELP TO BOOST OUR FUNDS 
THEY ARE ESTIMATED TO FETCH BETWEEN FORTY TO SIXTY 
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS BEAUTIFUL GARDEN CHRISTINE ENJOYS WORKING AS A DESIGNER 
SO IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT A LITTLE MORE ABOUT HER CAREER 
THIS IS A GOOD OLD RUMPUS ROOM YOU HAVE PLENTY OF STUFF IN HERE TO TAKE A LOOK AT CLOTHES 
IS THIS A LITTLE BRIDESMAID'S DRESS IS THIS ONE OF YOUR CREATIONS CHRISTINE 
WELL IT'S SOMETHING I'M ALTERING AT THE MOMENT FOR A LITTLE GIRL 
YOU USED TO BE A DESIGNER OF WEDDING DRESSES AND EVENING DRESSES HOW DID YOU GET INTO THAT 
BY CHANCE ACTUALLY I WENT THERE AS A QUALITY CONTROLLER 
THIS WAS IN A DRESS MANUFACTURER 
SAMPLE MACHINIST THEN THE DESIGNER WALKED OUT AND I SAID DON'T WORRY I'LL HELP YOU 
THEN I STARTED DESIGNING 
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING BUT IT WAS A S. L. E. S. S. 
JO YOU'VE PICKED UP YOUR MOTHER'S CREATIVITY BECAUSE YOU DESIGN JEWELLERY 
YEAH I MAKE JEWELLERY THIS IS A PIECE OF IT 
AND THEY WILL BE SIMPLE LIKE THIS OR I WILL DO AN INTRICATE BEADED NECKLACE 
AFTER ALL THAT HARD WORK FOR BOTH OF YOU I THINK YOU DESERVE A REAL GOOD BREAK 
WHAT SORT OF THING DO YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO ENJOY WHEN YOU GO ON THIS BREAK 
I WANT A MASSAGE REALLY THE WHOLE BACK AND SHOULDERS 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE WAY YOU SIT YOU END UP STOOPING OVER SO I'D LIKE TO BE LOOSENED UP 
WELL WE'LL HAVE TO DO A BIT MORE RUMMAGING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE THAT FIVE HUNDRED 
SO I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU TO THE BOX AND SEE WHAT ELSE I CAN FIND ALL RIGHT DARLING 
CHRISTINE AND JO ARE VERY INDEPENDENT HARD WORKING WOMEN 
I WANT TO MAKE THEIR DREAMS COME TRUE SO WE'D BETTER KEEP OUR SEARCH UP TO SCRATCH 
WE SOON TURN UP THESE GOLD PENDANTS 
INCLUDING A GOLD HALF SOVEREIGN ESTIMATED TO FETCH SEVENTY FIVE TO NINETY 
THE RUMMAGE ALSO PRODUCES ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF GLASS 
THIS DELICATE SCENT BOTTLE WITH A CUT GLASS TOP AND SILVER NECK IS VALUED AT THIRTY TO FIFTY 
IN THE LIVING ROOM JONTY IS PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS WITH HIS NEXT DISCOVERY 
THIS IS GREAT LOOK AT THIS DECANTER AND STOPPER 
IT'S LOVELY ISN'T IT IS IT ART DECO YES THE STYLE THESE LINES 
STRAIGHT LINES ART DECO 
WHEN IT COMES TO DECANTERS WHEN IT COMES TO GLASS YOU HAVE GOT TO CHECK FOR CONDITION 
BECAUSE OFTEN THE STOPPERS HAVE BEEN LOST OR THEY'VE BEEN CHIPPED OR DAMAGED 
THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY FINE SO CHECK THE BODY OH OH 
WHOOPS WE HAVE A CHIP DOWN AT THE BOTTOM 
THAT'S QUITE A LARGE CHIP 
SO INSTANTLY WE'VE CUT THIS DECANTER AND STOPPER BY HALF 
THE MARKET WOULD GO CRAZY FOR THIS IF IT WAS IN MINT CONDITION 
BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE CHIP THE DAMAGE WE ARE ONLY TALKING THIRTY TO FORTY HERE REALLY 
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THAT BREAK 
PUT IT IN THE SALE GO ON THEN 
YEAH IF THAT'S ONLY THIRTY WE HAVE SOME MORE WORK TO DO 
COME ON 
WHAT A SHAME THIS DECANTER HAS BEEN DAMAGED BECAUSE THE MARKET FOR ART DECO IS VERY HEALTHY AT THE MOMENT 
WE HAVE QUITE A COLLECTION OF INTERESTING ITEMS ON THE ROSTER SO FAR 
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO GET ANYWHERE NEAR THAT FIVE HUNDRED WE NEED QUITE A FEW MORE 
AND IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE CHRISTINE DIGS UP 
THIS INTRICATELY ENGRAVED SILVER SPADE 
WE HOPE IT WILL REACH TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY 
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME BUT WITH THE GIRLS' DAY OUT AT STAKE 
WE NEED AT LEAST ONE MORE VALUABLE ITEM LET'S HOPE CHRISTINE'S NEXT FIND IS JUST THE TICKET 
LOOK WHAT I'VE GOT WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE 
I THINK I SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST 
SAVED THE BEST TILL LAST WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE WHAT A LOVELY PICTURE 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS PICTURE WELL 
I THOUGHT IT WAS MADONNA AND CHILD THEN I WAS TOLD IT IS 
YOUNG JOHN THE BAPTIST BUT I AM NOT SURE WHICH IS WHICH 
THIS IS THE SEATED MADONNA AND CHILD 
THIS IS LITERALLY ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PICTURES IN THE WORLD 
WHEN I SAY MOST FAMOUS 
IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST REPRODUCED PICTURES IN THE WORLD AND THE ORIGINAL 
I KNOW WHAT'S COMING 
THE ORIGINAL IS BY RAPHAEL HIGH RENAISSANCE PAINTER FROM ITALY 
SO THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO CHECK WHETHER IT'S ORIGINAL COPY 
WHEN I SAY ORIGINAL COPY IS IT AN OIL PAINTING 
SO LET'S LOOK ACROSS THE CANVAS AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
IS THE LAYERS OF PAINT THE BRUSH STROKES CAN YOU SEE IT'S RELATIVELY EVEN 
RELATIVELY SMOOTH NOW THAT'S AN INDICATOR THAT IT'S NOT AN OIL PAINTING 
SO THEREFORE THIS IS A FACSIMILE OF A KIND 
SADLY I CAN'T PUT A LOT ON IT I SUPPOSE IT'LL BE AROUND THE FIFTY MARK 
FIFTY YES YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT A HUGE DISAPPOINTED LOOK 
VERY FIFTY YOU SURE YES IT'S GONNA BE THAT KIND OF FIGURE 
WE COULD ALWAYS PUT A RESERVE ON IT YES I THINK YEAH DEFINITELY 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL US WHAT THE RESERVE IS NOW WE CAN SORT THAT OUT AT THE TIME 
BUT YOU'RE HAPPY FOR IT TO GO TO AUCTION WITH A RESERVE WITH A RESERVE YEAH 
JO DO YOU WANT TO JOIN US 
HI GUYS UNFORTUNATELY JONTY HAS BAD NEWS ON THE PICTURE 
BECAUSE YOUR MUM WAS HOPING SHE HAD A VALUABLE OIL PAINTING 
AND IT HASN'T TURNED OUT THAT WAY 
SADLY IT'S ONLY WORTH ABOUT FIFTY AT AUCTION FIFTY QUID I KNOW 
I THOUGHT WE WERE BOTH GOING TO BE RETIRING ON THAT 
I'M FRAID AT THE MOMENT IF WE TAKE AWAY THE PICTURE AND THE PAPERWEIGHT IT COMES TO THREE HUNDRED 
RIGHT VERY DISAPPOINTED 
IF WE ADD THE PAPERWEIGHT AT ITS LOWEST ESTIMATE IT'S THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND IF WE ADD THE PICTURE AT ITS LOWEST AT FIFTY IT'S FOUR HUNDRED 
RIGHT SO WE'RE STILL ONE HUNDRED SHORT 
SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS 
TO LOOK ROUND THE HOUSE SEE WHETHER OR NOT BETWEEN NOW AND THE AUCTION 
THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN TAKE TO AUCTION THAT WILL GIVE YOU THAT EXTRA ONE HUNDRED O. K. 
AND WE'LL SEE YOU AT AUCTION 
POOR CHRISTINE AND JO 
I DO HOPE OUR VALUATIONS HAVEN'T BEEN TOO DISAPPOINTING FOR THEM 
BUT AS WE ALL KNOW ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AT AUCTION 
AMONG THE ITEMS GOING UNDER THE HAMMER ARE THE BEAUTIFUL NINETEEN TWENTIES 
GLASS CLARAT JUG WITH THE SILVER PLATED STOPPER 
IN PRISTINE CONDITION THIS EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES FROSTED LALIQUE GLASS SCENT BOTTLE 
STILL IN ITS GIFT BOX ESTIMATED TO FETCH UP TO SIXTY 
THE BEAUTIFUL SWAROVSKI CRYSTAL PAPERWEIGHT MADE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO WHICH COULD BRING IN UP TO SEVENTY 
AND FINALLY A COPY OF THE FAMOUS PAINTING BY RAPHAEL OF THE SEATED MADONNA 
WHICH JONTY ESTIMATES COULD FETCH FIFTY TO EIGHTY 
THOUGH I'M SURE CHRISTINE WOULD PREFER MORE 
STILL TO COME WHICH OF OUR ITEMS FIND FAVOUR WITH THE BIDDERS 
YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR EIGHTY SEVENTY FIVE 
HOW MUCH WILL JONTY'S GAMBLE COST HIM 
IF IT MAKES FIVE HUNDRED THE MEAL'S ON ME 
FIND OUT WHEN THE HAMMER FALLS 
WELL IT'S BEEN A WEEK OR TWO SINCE WE JOINED CHRISTINE AND JO 
AT HER HOME IN NORTH LONDON LOOKING FOR ALL THOSE ANTIQUES AND COLLECTABLES 
THAT WE COULD SELL TODAY HER TODAY AT GAZE AND AMP SON AUCTION ROOMS AT DISS IN NORFOLK 
REMEMBER SHE WANTS FIVE HUNDRED SO THE TWO OF THEM CAN GO OFF AND SPEND A RELAXING DAY AT A LUXURIOUS SPA 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY ON THE RUMMAGE WE DIDN'T QUITE MAKE THE TOTAL 
SO LET'S HOPE WE DO GET SOME REALLY GOOD BIDDING TODAY OR THE GIRLS COULD END UP TAKING AN EARLY BATH 
THIS AUCTION HOUSE IN NORFOLK ATTRACTS ANTIQUE ENTHUSIASTS FROM FAR AFIELD 
AND TODAY'S COLLECTABLES ARE CERTAINLY CATCHING THEIR EYES 
THANK GOODNESS JONTY IS HERE TO HELP US THROUGH WHAT COULD BE A NERVE WRACKING DAY 
JONTY MORNING HI I HAVE TO ADMIT I'M A BIT ANXIOUS ABOUT OUR AUCTION TODAY 
I'M GLAD YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I AM TOO 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT CHRISTINE THOUGHT SOME OF HER ITEMS 
WERE WORTH A LOT MORE THAN YOU WERE PREPARED TO VALUE THEM AT 
AND AS A CONSQEQUENCE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND THE FIVE HUNDRED THAT SHE NEEDS 
YES BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SOME DAMAGE ON THEM AS WELL 
DAMAGE ALL SORTS OF THINGS 
AND THE MADONNA AND CHILD I THINK SHE WAS CONVINCED IT WAS AN OIL PAINTING 
LET'S SEE WHAT SHE HAS DECIDED TO DO WITH HER THINGS 
REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE SELLING OR BUYING AT AUCTION YOU MUST BUDGET FOR VAT 
AND THE COMMISSION THAT WILL BE ADDED 
YOUR LOCAL AUCTION HOUSE 
BEFORE SHE'S TEMPTED TO BUY SOMETHING 
MORNING CHRISTINE HI ANGELA YOU HAVEN'T GOT JO YOUR DAUGHTER WITH YOU NO JO HAS A COLD 
SO ANNE MY SISTER IN LAW IS STANDING IN FOR JO HAVE YOU BEEN TO AN AUCTION BEFORE 
NO IT'S THE FIRST TIME OH REALLY WHAT HAVE YOU DECIDED TO DO WITH ALL OF YOUR ITEMS

WHAT HAVE YOU PUT ON THEM FIVE ON THE MADONNA AND THREE ON THE FIVE 
FIVE HUNDRED JONTY COME ON 
FIVE HUNDRED MY WORD 
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIT OF DRAMA TODAY GIRLS SO SHALL WE TAKE OUR PLACES IN THE AUCTION 
LET'S GO COME ON 
IT'S LOOKING LIKELY THAT CHRISTINE MAY BE TAKING TWO OF HER RESERVED ITEMS HOME 
BUT AUCTIONS CAN BE UNPREDICTABLE WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 
WE TAKE OUR POSITIONS AND WATCH OUR FIRST LEAST CONTROVERSIAL LOT GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
LOT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THAT COMES BACK TO THE FRONT

HAMMER COMES DOWN ON SEVENTY FIVE 
SEVENTY FIVE HOW ABOUT THAT VERY GOOD 
IF ALL OUR ITEMS KEEP COMING IN OVER ESTIMATE 
IT MAY JUST BE THAT CHRISTINE HAS THE LAST LAUGH TODAY 
BUT WE NEED THE REST OF OUR ITEMS TO FARE JUST AS WELL IF WE'RE TO REACH THAT TARGET 
LET'S HOPE OUR SECOND LOT WILL DO US PROUD 
HERE WE HAVE A NICE DECANTER WITH A GEOMETRIC DESIGN AND YOU HAVE PUT THIRTY TO FORTY ON IT 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH A LOT MORE WITHOUT THAT CHIP 
DO YOU REMEMBER I POINTED THAT OUT IT'S STILL A CHARMING THING 
LET'S HOPE IT'S GOING TO GO FOR A BIT MORE I START AT TWENTY EIGHT
