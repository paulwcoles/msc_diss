EVERYONE WAS COMING TO SEE ME TAME MY GRIZZLY BEAR 
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE RETURNED TO WASHINGTON TEN YEARS LATER WITH MY CHILDREN 
I WANTED TO SHOW THEM MARK BUT HE HAD DIED OH HE DIED

NOW WHEN I LOOK AT THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE OLYMPICS I SAY WOW HOW DO THEY DO THIS 
WELL QUITE NOW FREDERIC YOU HAVE TRAVELLED A LONG WAY TO BE WITH US TODAY 
I WAS IN THE BOARDING LINE IN WARSAW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 
IN POLAND YES MY MOTHER CALLED ME 
I JUMPED OUT OF THE BOARDING LINE SAID I WASN'T GOING TOOK MY SUITCASE BACK QUITE 
GRABBED ANOTHER PLANE AND DIDN'T WANT TO MISS BARGAIN HUNT 
ISN'T THAT ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT WHAT IS YOUR JOB ACTUALLY 
PHOTOGRAPHER 
AH I'M A FREELANCE PHOTOGRAPHER AND EDITOR 
AND I GO AROUND TAKING PICTURES OF TRAVEL NATURE CHILDREN 
I'M SURE YOU'LL DO AN ADMIRABLE JOB FOR US 
NOW THE MONEY MOMENT THREE HUNDRED APIECE 
THREE HUNDRED THAT'S QUITE A FEW EUROS 
O. K. YOU KNOW THE RULES YOUR EXPERTS AWAIT AND OFF YOU GO 
AND VERY VERY GOOD LUCK 
TWO TRIBES BY FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD 
GIVING THE RED TEAM A HAND OR TWO IT'S ANITA MANNING 
AND HOPING TO POUR OUT SUCCESS FOR THE BLUES IT'S KATE BLISS 
I FOUND THIS JUG WINSTON CHURCHILL JUG 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD ROYAL DOULTON 
LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY CRACKS OR MARKS 
IT LOOKS IN PRETTY GOOD ORDER 
I THINK YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL THERE 
WHAT WE HAVE IS ROYAL DOULTON WHICH IS THE BEST OF FACTORIES 
WE HAVE WINSTON CHURCHILL AN ICONIC FIGURE YEAH YEP 
AND OLD CHOOSE HERE HAS EXAMINED IT CAREFULLY FOR ANY DEFECTS AND THERE ARE NONE AT ALL 
SO WE'RE TICKING ALL THOSE BOXES 
THEY DID THREE SIZES OF THESE JUGS 
SMALL ONES MIDDLE SIZED AND BIGGER ONES AND THEY DID HIS COAT IN 
VARIOUS DIFFERENT COLOURS AND THIS PARTICULAR SANDY COLOURED COAT IS 
THE MOST COMMON OF THEM UH HMM 
RIGHT PRICE WISE 
THEY WANT NINETY EIGHT FOR IT 
TOO MUCH YOU'VE GOT TO GET THAT DOWN HAVEN'T WE 
BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY OF THESE JUGS MADE THEY WERE NOT RARE SO THEY SHOULD NOT BE DEAR 
HE WILL BE WELL FANCIED BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON PRICE 
MY PERSONAL FEELING IF YOU CAN GET THAT FOR ABOUT FORTY WE'RE DOING WELL 
YEAH I WILL TRY FOR YOU LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET A BARGAIN FOR YOU DO YOUR BEST 
AND TRY HE DID BUT OLD WINNIE STILL SET THEM BACK FIFTY 
KATE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS 
WELL THIS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT 
NOW WHY DID YOU SPOT THIS FREDERIC 
I USED TO BE IN CAFES IN PARIS AND PLAYED PINBALL 
AND THIS IS LIKE AN ORIGINAL PINBALL GAME 
IT'S GREAT ISN'T IT I REALLY LIKE THE WAY THAT IT'S MADE 
IF WE LOOK WE'VE GOT A GOOD STRONG MAHOGANY CASE 
I WOULD THINK THIS DATES FROM ABOUT THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THIS IS THE SCORING 
LITTLE BOARD ALONG HERE THAT'S BEEN INLAID DOWN THE SIDE 
OFTEN THEY WOULD HAVE JUST USED MATCHSTICKS WHEN THIS WAS PRODUCED 
AND YOU'VE GOT THE BALLS OFTEN THESE WOULD BE MADE OF IVORY BUT I THINK THESE ARE A LITTLE BIT LATER 
WHAT WE'RE MISSING HERE IS A REALLY NICE MANUFACTURER'S LABEL 
IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE A REALLY NICE NAME ON IT 
BUT THE GOOD THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT'S COMPACT SO YOU CAN PUT IT IN A SMALL HOUSE 
YOU CAN TRAVEL WITH IT TAKE IT ABOUT AND IT WOULD BE EASILY PUT AWAY 
DO YOU LIKE IT I LIKE IT I THINK IT COULD PLEASE ANY PEOPLE 
I MEAN YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND PEOPLE LIKE ME 
WHAT ABOUT THE PRICE FREDERIC 
NINETY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT FREDERIC 
I WANT TO BARGAIN DON'T I I CAN SEE IT AT AUCTION MAKING ANYTHING BETWEEN FIFTY AND EIGHTY 
SO WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A CHAT WITH HIM AND SEE WHAT HE CAN DO 
AND FREDERIC KNOCKED THE TABLE BILLIARD SET DOWN TO SIXTY 
I KNOW YOU LOVE FURNITURE 
I KNOW YOU LOVE WOOD 
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BOX TELL ME ABOUT IT 
WELL ANITA I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE OAK SMOKER'S CABINET 
AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOT COMPLETE IN ITSELF EVERYTHING IS THERE 
WE'VE GOT ALL OF THE BITS AND PIECES INSIDE THE SMOKER'S PARTS 
UH HMM AND I THINK IT'S WORTH A BID 
WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHY I LIKE IT 
I LIKE IT BECAUSE OF THIS LOVELY COPPERISED PANEL AT THE FRONT 
I'M FROM GLASGOW AND US GLASWEGIANS LOVE THE ART NOUVEAU PERIOD 
BETWEEN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY AND NINETEEN TEN 
AND THIS PANEL WITH ITS SINUOUS NATURALISTIC MOTIF 
EXPRESSES THE ART NOUVEAU PERIOD AND I THINK PEOPLE WILL LIKE IT BECAUSE OF THAT 
SO IT'S A LOVELY CLEAN LITTLE CABINET 
SMOKER'S ITEMS ARE NOT AS POPULAR NOW AS THEY WERE BEFORE 
BUT THIS LITTLE CABINET WHICH I THINK BY THE WAY HAS A VERY FEMININE FEEL TO IT COULD BE USED 
AS A LITTLE TRINKET BOX FOR YOUR BEADS AND SO ON HANGING FROM HERE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT 
I THINK IT'S A LOVELY PIECE OF OAK VERY WELL FINISHED OFF 
GENERALLY I THINK IT'S A NICE PIECE 
I THINK WE SHOULD PUT A BID ON IT I THINK IT'S A LOVELY ITEM 
TELL ME PRICE 
SIXTY FIVE WE'LL HAVE TO GET THAT DOWN 
I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAIR ENOUGH FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO BUT I THINK NOW 
WE HAVE TO GET THE PRICE DOWN IF WE'RE HOPING TO MAKE SOME MONEY ON IT 
USE YOUR CHARM YOU'VE PLENTY OF IT 
RIGHT SO IF I GET THAT PRICE DOWN YOU THINK IT'S WORTH A CHANCE 
I THINK IT'S A LOVELY BOX AND I HOPE IT WILL BE WELL FANCIED IN THE AUCTION GOOD 
FORTY FIVE PAID FOR THE OAK BOX LET'S HOPE IT'S NOT MONEY GOING UP IN SMOKE 
HEY GUYS COME AND HAVE A LITTLE LOOK AT THIS 
THIS IS SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DELICATE 
NICE LEATHER CASE AND OPEN IT UP 
WOW WOW AND WE HAVE A LITTLE SET OF BOTTLES 
NICE 
NOW I THINK THIS WOULD BE FOR A LADY CERTAINLY 
BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SIZE AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THESE PRETTY PASTEL COLOURS WE'VE GOT ON THE ENAMEL 
AND I WOULD THINK PROBABLY FOR SMELLING SALTS OR FOR DIFFERENT PERFUMES 
ARE THEY SILVER 
IT IS SILVER YES IN FACT I THOUGHT OF YOU GUYS BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE A BIT OF A FRENCH LOOK ABOUT THEM 
THE PASTEL COLOURS ARE CERTAINLY TYPICALLY FRENCH AND THIS ENAMELLING CERTAINLY HAS A FRENCH TERM 
IT'S CALLED BASSE TAILLE ENAMELLING AND IT WORKS BECAUSE THE SILVER TOP HERE 
IS ENGRAVED WITH THIS STARBURST PATTERN AND THEN THE ENAMEL OR THE MOLTEN GLASS IS LAID OVER THE TOP 
AND IT GIVES THIS LOVELY SHIMMERY GLASSY EFFECT BEAUTIFUL YES 
SO THEY DO LOOK SLIGHTLY FRENCH BUT THE HALLMARK IS ENGLISH SILVER AND IT'S DATED FOR NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
WOW WHICH GOES WITH THE PASTEL COLOURS REALLY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK FREDERIC IT'S MORE OF A LADIES' PIECE BUT DO YOU LIKE THIS AS A COLLECTOR'S ITEM 
I THINK IT'S NICE BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT ART DECO YOU KNOW LEATHER VERY NICE OBJECT YES 
HOW MUCH IS THIS ONE FOR THE PRICE TAG GUYS IS WAIT FOR IT ONE HUNDRED 
NO BUT BEARING IN MIND WE'VE GOT A COMPLETE SET HERE 
AND IT'S IN NICE CONDITION 
AND ALSO THE HALLMARKS ON THE SILVER ARE QUITE CLEAR AND CRISP 
AND I THINK AS A COLLECTOR'S ITEM IT HAS A CHANCE OF DOING QUITE WELL 
LET'S TRY ON ESSAYE 
THEY PAID NINETY FOR THE TRIO OF SCENT BOTTLES 
SOME OF THESE DEALERS REALLY DO HAVE SOMETHING TO LEARN ABOUT DISPLAY AND MARKETING 
NOW THIS LITTLE POT THIS CHEAP PLASTIC POT HAS ACTUALLY GOT IN IT 
A WHOLE GROUP OF OBJECTS WHICH I BOUGHT AS A JOB LOT 
NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE EXQUISITE LITTLE MINIATURES 
ALL CHUCKED INTO THIS PLASTIC BOX 
NOT BEAUTIFULLY SET OUT JUST SIMPLY MUDDLED UP 
AND WITHOUT TAKING THEM OUT REALLY YOU CAN'T BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND 
THE BEAUTY AND EXQUISITE VARIETY OF WHAT WE HAVE HERE 
QUITE FRANKLY IT'S A MIRACLE THAT NONE OF THEM HAD BEEN BROKEN THUS FAR 
OVERALL WE'VE GOT TWELVE LITTLE PIECES OF GLASS HERE 
RANGING FROM A SPHERICAL CARAFE TO A RING NECKED DECANTER 
A LOVELY LITTLE BOWL COMPLETE WITH A GLASS LADLE 
A SQUASHED BROWN DECANTER 
A VARIETY OF DRINKING GLASS INCLUDING A TALL CORDIAL 
TWO OR THREE STEMMED WINES AND TWO NICE BALUSTER WINES 
A WONDERFUL RANGE ACROSS THE DRINKING GLASS SPECTRUM 
THESE ARE THE SORT OF OBJECTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE WANTED TO FURNISH YOUR DOLL'S HOUSE WITH 
AND SOME OF THESE PIECES OF GLASS COULD DATE FROM AS EARLY AS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY OR EVEN A LITTLE BEFORE 
THEY'RE EXQUISITE AREN'T THEY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE WORTH 
SURELY TEN TO FIFTEEN PER PIECE WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM MAYBE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND THEM AT 
ALL MIXED UP IN THE OLD PLASTIC BOX 
THE WHOLE LOT COULD BE YOURS FOR FIFTEEN 
AH THERE YOU ARE I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU 
WE'VE GOT TO BUY A THIRD ITEM ONE MORE TO GO 
YOU'RE LOOKING SORT OF GUILTY 
WHAT DOES THIS TELL ME SO WHAT'S THE STORY HERE 
WELL WE LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S THE COUNTRY 
WE LIKE THE COUNTRY IT'S QUITE RUSTIC 
I KNOW BUT THEN MY GRANDFATHER MIGHT HAVE PLAYED WITH IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK FREDERIC IS THIS REALLY JOELLE'S CHOICE OR ARE YOU PARTNERS IN CRIME WITH THIS 
I THINK IT'S A CHARMING PIECE IT'S RUSTIC AND IT'S PROBABLY 
WHAT WE WOULD FIND ON MANTELPIECE IN A COTTAGE IN FRANCE 
WELL IT DOES HAVE A SORT OF RUSTIC CHARM 
THE GOOD THING ABOUT IT I THINK GUYS IS THAT IT IS A TOY 
AND THE AUCTION WE'RE GOING TO HAS A GOOD TOY SECTION 
BUT I HAVE TO SAY LET'S LOOK AT IT CLOSELY 
IT'S THE CONDITION THAT REALLY LETS IT DOWN THIS POOR LITTLE HORSE 
LOOK AT HIM HIS LITTLE CHAIN OR HIS HARNESS IS VERY RUSTY 
HE'S ALMOST LOST ALL HIS HAIR 
HE'S GOT A STRAGGLY TAIL HERE 
THE PAINTWORK IS CRACKED AND WORN AWAY 
HE'S BEEN THROUGH IT REALLY HASN'T HE 
YES BUT IT MEANS SOMEBODY LOVED HIM VERY MUCH 
I THINK AS A RUSTIC PIECE IT'S GOT A CERTAIN APPEAL A CERTAIN SWEET CHARM ABOUT IT 
I THINK IF YOU PAID SORT OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THEN O. K. IT MIGHT STAND A CHANCE AT AUCTION MM 
OH I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THIS 
TWENTY FIVE IS WHAT WE SAY 
COME ON JOELLE TELL ME HOW MUCH 
IT WAS NINETY FIVE AND WE GOT IT DOWN TO SEVENTY 
SEVENTY WELL O. K. WELL I REALLY HOPE I'M PROVED WRONG ON THIS ONE 
PERSONALLY I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE A BIT OF A FIGHT ON OUR HANDS ON THIS ONE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BOUGHT IT WITHOUT ME 
THAT'S VERY FRENCH ISN'T IT ANYWAY THE TOY HORSE AND CART CANTERED IN AT SEVENTY 
GUYS GUYS THE FAYRE'S COMING TO A CLOSE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME AND I'VE FOUND A VERY BONNY BOWL 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS 
IT LOOKS LIKE WILLIAM MOORCROFT 
IT IS MOORCROFT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
WILLIAM MOORCROFT WORKED WITH JAMES MCINTYRE 
IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS AND STARTED UP ON HIS OWN ROUND ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTEEN 
MOORCROFT WAS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE FACTORIES 
THE BOWL IS A LATER ONE 
IT'S POST NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND IF WE LOOK AT THE BACK STAMP WE SEE MADE IN ENGLAND 
THE EMBOSSED MOORCROFT STAMP AND WE CAN ALSO SEE THE SIGNATURE 
NOW THIS IS THE SIGNATURE OF WALTER MOORCROFT WHO WAS THE SON OF WILLIAM MOORCROFT YEAH 
SO IT'S QUITE A LATE PIECE DO YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE PATTERN 
UH HUH THE PATTERN IS THE HIBISCUS PATTERN 
IT'S NOT A RARE PATTERN BUT IT IS A POPULAR PATTERN 
AND I LOVE THE COLOURS 
IN FACT THE BOWL AND I ARE COLOUR COORDINATED 
WHAT'S THE CONDITION LIKE OF IT 
WELL THE CONDITION IN THE MAIN IS GOOD BUT WE HAVE SOME STAINING 
ON THE INSIDE OF THE BOWL AND I THINK THIS MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY IT BEING USED AS A FRUIT BOWL 
AND THE ACID FROM THE FRUIT SLIGHTLY DISCOLOURING IT WHICH IS A WEE BIT OF A SHAME 
BUT I'M HOPING THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE TOO MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE 
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR IT 
I RECKON IT'S WORTH A TRY DEFINITELY YOU GO FOR IT 
IT'S IN GOOD CONDITION THE STAINING IN THE MIDDLE THAT MIGHT MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFERENCE 
AGE LOOKS A LITTLE BIT 
IT HAS AN EXPENSIVE PRICE ON IT 
I'M HOPING TO GET A BIG CHUNK OFF OF IT BECAUSE IT IS THE END OF THE DAY 
LET'S HOPE SO SHALL I GO FOR IT 
ANITA YOU DO YOUR BEST FOR US 
I'M GOING TO USE EVERY OUNCE OF CHARM THAT I HAVE 
YOU'RE THE ONE TO DO IT TO SEE IF I CAN GET IT DOWN O. K. 
THANK YOU 
ANITA PAID ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOR THE MOORCROFT BOWL 
WELL THAT'S ENOUGH BELLOWING 
TIME'S UP LET'S SEE WHAT THE TEAMS HAVE BOUGHT 
THE REDS FATHER AND SON MARTIN AND ROLAND 
HOPE TO FIGHT THEM ON THE BEACHES WITH THE CHURCHILL TOBY MUG FOR FIFTY 
THE ART NOUVEAU SMOKER'S BOX WAS FORTY FIVE 
BUT THEIR BIG INVESTMENT WAS ONE HUNDRED NINETY SMACKERS FOR THE MOORCROFT BOWL 
WAS THAT GOOD FOR YOU TWO THAT WAS BRILLIANT EXCELLENT 
WE ENJOYED IT WELL AND THAT SHOWS IN THE AMOUNT THAT YOU SPENT 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE WHICH IS VERY GOOD 
WHICH IS YOUR FAVOURITE ITEM 
I THINK THE SMOKER'S CABINET DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
SMOKER'S CABINET VERY GOOD 
AND MARTIN WHICH ITEM IS GOING TO BRING THE BIGGEST PROFIT THE BOWL 
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT DAD I'LL AGREE WITH THAT VERY NICE TOO 
O. K. FIFTEEN WORTH OF LEFTOVER LOLLY WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY MARVELLOUS 
BUT NOT SO MARVELLOUS FOR YOU ANITA IS IT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH FIFTEEN 
WELL WITH THIS MISERABLE AMOUNT OF DOSH I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BE A WEE BIT CANNY 
NO ONE BETTER QUALIFIED ON THE CANNY FRONT THAN OUR ANITA 
ANYWAY GOOD LUCK ANITA LET'S SEE WHAT THE BLUES BOUGHT 
JOELLE AND FREDERIC HAD A GAME START POTTING THE TABLE FOR SIXTY 
THEY'RE HOPING FOR THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS 
WITH THESE SCENT BOTTLES NINETY PAID 
AND THEIR THIRD ITEM A TOY HORSE AND CART NEIGHED IN AT SEVENTY 
WHICH IS YOUR FAVOURITE ITEM 
MINE IS THE TOY THE TOY THE CARRIAGE AND THE HORSE 
O. K. WHAT ABOUT YOU FREDERICO 
THE BILLIARDS TABLE THAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE 
WHICH ITEM IS GOING TO BRING THE BIGGEST PROFIT 
THE ONE KATE CHOOSES YOU RECKON 
YEAH I'M SURE SHE TOLD US IT WAS A GOOD IDEA SO WE WENT FOR IT 
WHAT ABOUT YOU FREDERICO YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
YEAH I DO SO IT'S GOING TO BE THE SCENT BOTTLES FOR THAT 
WELL YOU SPEND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY WHICH IS QUITE A MATURE AMOUNT 
VERY PLEASED WITH YOU ABOUT THAT VERY NICE 
EIGHTY POUNDS OF LEFTOVER LOLLY PLEASE 
NOT AT ALL KEEN ON PASSING OVER THE CASH ARE YOU FREDERIC 
HAVE YOU HAD TROUBLE WITH THEM TODAY 
THEY'VE BEEN A RIGHT HANDFUL HAVE THEY THEY'VE BEEN GREAT FUN ACTUALLY 
I KNEW AT THE OUTSET THEY WERE GOING TO BE TROUBLE 
THEY'VE GOT VERY SET IDEAS AND THEY GO FOR IT 
GOT ANY SET IDEAS YOURSELF 
I HAVE A LITTLE J. E. N. E. SAIS QUOI 
HO HO WE'RE BUCKING UP THE FRENCH ANYWAY HAVE A LOVELY TIME 
ENOUGH OF THIS DIGGING AROUND FOR BARGAINS I'M GOING TO GO AND DIG UP SOME HISTORY 
I LOVE A BIT OF NOSTALGIA DON'T YOU 
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE AROUND IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
YOU'LL RECOGNISE THAT B. B. C. BLACK AND WHITE ARCHIVE CLIP 
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE INTERLUDE PIECES AND IT WAS CALLED THE POTTER'S WHEEL 
BUT WHY DID I WANT TO SHOW IT TO YOU 
WELL I'VE COME TO THE PLACE WHERE THAT WAS ACTUALLY FILMED 
THIS IS THE COMPTON POTTERY NEAR GUILDFORD IN SURREY WHICH ONCE WAS A MECCA FOR ARTISTS AND DESIGNERS 
SADLY THE POTTERY CLOSED IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE BUT A SELECTION OF CERAMICS PRODUCED 
BY THE COMPTON POTTERY AND ITS FOUNDER MARY SEATON WATTS 
ARE STILL EXHIBITED IN THE GALLERY DEDICATED TO HER HUSBAND 
THE GREAT PAINTER AND SCULPTOR GEORGE FREDERICK WATTS 
MARY WATTS WAS A SYMBOLIST CRAFTSPERSON 
DESIGNER AND SOCIAL REFORMER 
SHE WAS BORN IN INDIA AND SPENT MUCH OF HER CHILDHOOD IN SCOTLAND 
SHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST WOMEN TO RECEIVE PROFESSIONAL ART TRAINING 
AND IN HER EARLY YEARS WAS A RECOGNISED PORTRAIT PAINTER 
IT WAS AFTER HER MARRIAGE TO GEORGE WATTS THAT THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF HER WORK ENLARGED ENORMOUSLY 
WORKING WITH BAS RELIEFS AND CELTIC KNOTS 
AND ART NOUVEAU SINUOUS FOLIAGE IN TEXTILES AND IN METALWORK 
BUT IT'S HER EXQUISITE POTTERY THAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU TODAY 
MARY CO FOUNDED THE COMPTON POTTER'S GUILD WHICH WAS SET UP TO PROVIDE 
EMPLOYMENT AND ARTISTIC INSTRUCTION TO LOCAL VILLAGERS AND CRAFTSPEOPLE 
HERE YOU CAN SEE MARY IN HER SCULPTRESSES' GOWN 
IN THE MEMORIAL CHAPEL LITERALLY CARVING IN GESSO HER DESIGNS ON THE WALLS 
OVER HERE IN GLORIOUS TECHNICOLOUR IS AN ALTARPIECE MADE BY HER IN EXACTLY THE SAME TECHNIQUE 
IN THE TWO GLAZED VITRINES WE CAN SEE A SELECTION OF THE COMPTON DOMESTIC PRODUCTION 
AND IF YOU LIKE THAT SORT OF BRIGHTLY COLOURED CERAMICS IT'LL ABSOLUTELY DO IT FOR YOU 
BUT FOR ME THE FAB PART OF THE PRODUCTION FROM THIS COMPTON POTTERY REVOLVES AROUND ITS GARDEN URNS 
TAKE A LITTLE POT LIKE THIS 
IT'S A GREAT SHAPE THIS SQUASHED COMPRESSED OVOID 
IF WE TURN IT ON ONE SIDE RATHER LIKE A CELTIC COOKING VESSEL 
IT'S GOT THESE ODDBALL LUGGY TYPE FEET NICE OUTSET HANDLES AND THE DECORATION ITSELF 
WHICH IS HAND INCISED IS OF CELTIC KNOTS ONE OF MARY'S FAVOURITE DECORATIVE DEVICES 
SHE WAS COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL WITH THESE OUTSIDE WARES 
INDEED SELLING THEM THROUGH THE GREAT RETAILER IN LONDON LIBERTY AND AMP CO 
AND THIS ONE IS STAMPED DESIGNED AND MANUFACTURED BY LIBERTY AND AMP CO 
OF COURSE LIBERTY NEVER ACTUALLY MADE THEM 
BUT THEY DID INSIST ALWAYS ON HAVING THAT STAMP ON ANYTHING THAT THEY SOLD 
THE BIG QUESTION IS TODAY WILL OUR TEAMS BE ABLE TO IMPRESS THEIR STAMP OVER AT THE AUCTION 
WELL IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE AT LAWRENCE'S SALEROOM IN BLETCHINGLEY 
IN SURREY WITH THE PROPRIETOR ROBIN LAWRENCE GOOD MORNING TIM 
NOW MARTIN AND ROLAND WENT WITH WINSTON CHURCHILL HERE 
TYPICAL BIT OF DOULTON 
THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE WHO COLLECT CHURCHILL RELATED ITEMS 
SO IT MAY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF ADDED VALUE THERE 
WE'RE THINKING THIRTY TO FIFTY FOR THAT ONE 
WELL O. K. FIFTY WAS PAID 
NOW THE COPPER PLAQUE ENCRUSTED SMOKING CABINET YES 
THESE THINGS ARE USUALLY QUITE DESIRABLE AREN'T THEY THIS ONE'S QUITE ATTRACTIVE 
THE ART NOUVEAU FEATURE IN THE DOOR SHOULD MAKE IT QUITE SALEABLE 
FORTY TO SIXTY SHOULD BE POSSIBLE O. K. FORTY FIVE PAID 
SO THAT'S GOT REAL HOPE 
AND THE MOORCROFT BOWL THIS WHAT THEY'RE PINNING THEIR HOPES ON 
IF IT WERE PERFECT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD BUY BUT I FEEL IT'S HAD SOME RESTORATION 
IS IT NOT PERFECT I DON'T THINK SO THERE'S PAINT FLAKING OFF ON THIS RIM HERE 
IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL THAT POSSIBLY A CHIP OR A CRACK HAS BEEN RESTORED AND OVER SPRAYED THERE 
FLAKING OFF PAINT IS NEVER A GOOD IDEA ON A CERAMIC 
IT MAKES ONE SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S BEEN RESTORATION 
I'M THINKING JUST FIFTY TO EIGHTY FOR THAT HOW MUCH 
FIFTY TO EIGHTY 
OH DEAR ONE HUNDRED NINETY PAID THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG SHOCK I TELL YOU 
I THINK IT WOULD BE WORTH THAT SORT OF PRICE PERFECT 
YEAH BUT PERHAPS NOT WITH DAMAGE 
WELL THEY'VE NOT SPOTTED THAT RESTORATION 
THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG BLOW 
THE OTHER TWO ITEMS HAVE A CERTAIN HOPE ABOUT THEM 
SO FOR CERTAIN THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THEIR BONUS BUY 
LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
NOW YOU GAVE FIFTEEN SMACKERS TO ANITA THAT'S RIGHT 
WELL THE BOYS DIDN'T LEAVE ME MUCH MONEY AT ALL SORRY ABOUT THAT 
BUT I'VE VERY PLEASED TO HAVE GOT A VERY NICE LITTLE PIECE OF TWENTIETH CENTURY SCANDINAVIAN DESIGN 
NOW THESE LITTLE PLATES AND THERE ARE THREE OF THEM ARE CALENDAR PLATES 
AND THEY WERE DESIGNED BY BJORN WINBLAD 
AND I THINK THEY'RE VERY VERY NICE 
CAN I TAKE ONE HAVE A LOOK AT THEM 
NOW THEY MADE DIFFERENT PLATES FOR EACH MONTH OF THE YEAR 
AND THEY WERE INTENDED TO DEPICT THE JOY OF LIFE 
AND IT'S A YOUNG COUPLE MEETING IN JANUARY 
AND BY THE TIME WE GET TO DECEMBER THEY'VE HAD A BABY 
THESE ARE THREE OF TWELVE 
THESE ARE THREE OF TWELVE 
WHAT WAS THE TIME AND THE AGE AGAIN 
THESE WILL BE FIFTIES SIXTIES 
OH RIGHT AND YOU SPENT 
FIFTEEN WE'RE SORRY ABOUT THAT 
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ME MUCH IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE YOU WANT TO ASK ROLAND 
I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW MUCH ANITA THINKS THEY POSSIBLY WILL MAKE 
I THINK THAT WE'LL MAKE A LITTLE PROFIT ON IT 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT BUT I THINK WE SHOULD 
DOUBLE YOUR MONEY WE MIGHT WE MIGHT 
YOU OPTIMISTIC FELLOW 
ANYWAY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VIEWERS LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT THEM 
SO HERE WE GO THREE OF THESE JOKERS 
BJORN WINBLAD WINBLAD 
YES HE'S DANISH A CERAMIC DESIGNER 
QUITE LATE PIECES NOT OF GREAT VALUE BUT 
IT'S THE SORT OF THING THEY SEEM FAMILIAR SORT OF LINE OF THEM THESE RATHER SPIKY RETRO FIGURES 
I THINK THEY'RE CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS DESIGNS 
THESE ACTUALLY REPRESENT MONTHS OF THE YEAR 
SO THEY'RE PART OF A BIGGER SET I THINK 
THEY MIGHT GET TWENTY TO THIRTY 
SHE'LL BE DELIGHTED ABOUT THAT 
WELL THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS 
NOW FOR THE BLUES THEIR FIRST ITEM IS THE TABLE BILLIARD SET 
MAHOGANY CABINET LITTLE BIT OF INLAY WORK AND ER 
A SET OF BALLS TO GO WITH IT HOW MUCH 
THIRTY TO FIFTY SIXTY PAID SO THAT COULD BE A BIT TIGHT COULDN'T IT 
BUT IT'S A HANDSOME THING FOR SIXTY I RECKON 
YOU GET A LOT FOR YOUR MONEY DON'T YOU YOU DO 
YEAH NOW THE SILVER TOPPED SCENT BOTTLES 
THAT IS A LOVELY LITTLE LOT ISN'T IT 
IT'S A VERY NICE LITTLE PIECE OF CAMPAIGN WARE 
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE A SOLDIER NEEDING SILVER MOUNTED ENAMEL SCENT BOTTLES IN THE TRENCHES BUT 
WELL QUITE BECAUSE WHEN THIS THING'S SHUT UP IT LOOKS REALLY BUTCH 
IT'S AN UNUSUAL OBJECT BUT I STILL THINK IT'S RATHER GOOD 
THE QUALITY IS THERE SEVENTY TO NINETY WE FEEL 
REALLY WELL THEY PAID NINETY ACTUALLY 
NEXT UP IS THIS HORSE AND CART 
VERY RUSTIC ITEM BUT COMPLETELY GENUINE THING 
ALL IN NICE ORIGINAL CONDITION DON'T SEE A GREAT DEAL OF VALUE THERE THOUGH 
PROBABLY THIRTY FIFTY IN THE AUCTION 
OH DEAR SEVENTY THEY WENT FOR ACTUALLY 
AT LEAST IT'S ONE HORSEPOWER ISN'T IT INDEED 
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THEIR BONUS BUY I FANCY SO LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
JOELLE WHERE'S FREDERIC 
UNFORTUNATELY HE'S ON AN ASSIGNMENT HE'S ON AN ASSIGNMENT 
SOMEWHERE IN EUROPE I DON'T KNOW WHERE 
YOU DID GIVE KATE EIGHTY OF LEFTOVER LOLLY 
AND WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW NOW JOELLE IS WHAT KATE SPENT IT ON 
O. K. KATE REVEAL ALL ARE YOU READY 
YES WE'RE READY 
I'VE BOUGHT YOU A VERY STYLISH BOWL WHICH COULD BE QUITE VERSATILE 
IT HAS THE LOOK OF BEING HAMMERED SILVER AND DATING FROM APPROXIMATELY 
THE VERY EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY BECAUSE IT IS IN THE DESIGN OF THE ARTS AND CRAFT MOVEMENT 
IT'S MADE BY A VERY COLLECTIBLE MANUFACTURER CALLED THE KESWICK SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL ART 
THIS WAS A DESIGN SCHOOL THAT REALLY FOLLOWED THE ARTS AND CRAFTS 
METHODS OF MANUFACTURE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THEIR DESIGNS 
IT'S MARKED ON THE BOTTOM FOR ALL THE COLLECTORS AND POTENTIAL BUYERS TO SEE 
AND IT'S ACTUALLY MADE OF A STAINLESS STEEL 
IT LOOKS LIKE SILVER BUT IT'S MUCH HARDER SO IT WEARS A LOT BETTER 
THEY CALLED IT STAYBRITE 
I THINK IT'S UNUSUAL BEAUTIFUL 
IMPECCABLE TASTE BUT IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT WOULD BLEND WITH A VERY TRADITIONAL INTERIOR AS WELL 
WITH EVERYTHING IN FACT YEAH 
REALLY GOOD CHOICE YES 
WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW KATE WHAT YOU SPENT ON IT DID YOU SPEND THE EIGHTY I DIDN'T 
I TRIED QUITE HARD TO SPEND THE EIGHTY BUT I SPENT JUST THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE 
SO WE'LL MAKE A PROFIT I'M SURE YOU RECKON OH YEAH 
STILL YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE UNTIL YOU'VE SOLD THE FIRST THREE ITEMS 
BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VIEWERS HERE'S WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS 
SO STAYBRITE ROBIN HMM STAYBRITE 
KESWICK SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
A HAMMERED SILVER PLATED DISH DO YOU THINK THAT'S FIFTIES THEN I THINK IT PROBABLY IS 
THIS FIRM WERE ACTUALLY IN BUSINESS UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BUT IT'S STYLISH AND WOULD BLEND WITH A MODERN INTERIOR 
SO WHAT SORT OF ESTIMATE THIRTY TO FIFTY 
O. K. THIRTY FIVE PAID BY KATE BLISS NOW TELL ME THE IMPORTANT QUESTION ARE YOU OUR AUCTIONEER TODAY 
YES I AM WE'RE IN SAFE HANDS 
NOW HERE'S SOMETHING TO GET YOUR PULSES RACING 
IS THAT NOT ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS 
WELL WHAT IS IT T. IM 
WELL IT'S DESCRIBED IN THE CATALOGUE AS BEING AN ORIENTAL FAN CASE 
WHICH IS PERFECTLY LOGICAL REALLY BECAUSE IF I PULL IT OPEN LIKE THAT 
IT REVEALS AN OVAL TROUGH 
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE A LITTLE FAN NESTLING IN THAT 
ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT IT HAS NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH FANS 
WHAT IT IS ACTUALLY IS A LITTLE PEN CASE 
NOW THIS THING WAS MADE IN PERSIA AROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTIES 
IT'S PAPIER MACHE THAT'S MASHED UP BITS OF PAPER 
THAT HAVE BEEN LACQUERED AND EXQUISITELY PAINTED 
NOW I'VE SEEN A FEW OF THESE PERSIAN PEN CASES BUT NEVER WITH A DESIGN QUITE LIKE THIS 
IF YOU LOOK THE TOP IS DECORATED WITH THREE OVALS AS ARE EACH OF THE SIDES AND A SINGLE OVAL ON EACH END 
AND WITHIN EACH OF THOSE OVALS ARE SOME EUROPEAN WOMEN 
INSIDE WHICH HASN'T BEEN WORN AT ALL YOU CAN SEE HOW BRILLIANT 
THOSE GILT DESIGNS ARE NOW THAT'S NOT TRANSFERRED 
THAT'S NOT MECHANICALLY PAINTED ON 
EACH OF THOSE FINE GOLD LINES 
IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT OF GOLD 
WHICH HAS BEEN PAINTED ONTO THE LACQUERED SURFACE 
TAKE A LOOK AT THE QUALITY OF THESE PAINTINGS 
THESE LITTLE RINGLETS OF HAIR RUNNING DOWN THE GIRLS' NECKS 
THE OTHER INTERESTING THING ABOUT IT IS THE ESTIMATE 
WHICH IS EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY COS I THINK THIS THING 
PROPERLY RESTORED AND IN THE RIGHT SALE 
COULD BRING BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND 
SEE I TOLD YOU YOUR PULSES WOULD START TO RACE
