I FEEL LIKE I'M CONSTANTLY CHASING MY TAIL 
SOMETIMES I THINK HOW AM I COPING 
YOU DON'T HAVE BACK UP THERE'S JUST YOU 
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT IF LIVING TOGETHER WILL MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR THEM AND THEIR CHILDREN 
BECAUSE I WANT EVERYONE TO LIKE ME 
EVERY FEW DAYS ONE OF THE MUMS WILL BE LEADER 
MY INSTINCT TELLS ME TO BE SCARED 
LAYING DOWN RULES FOR HOUSEWORK AND CHILDCARE 
WHILE I'M LEADING THEY'LL DO IT MY WAY 
AND ALSO CHALLENGING THE OTHER MUMS TO MAKE RADICAL CHANGES IN THEIR LIVES 
DON'T MAKE US DO THIS WE DON'T NEED TO DO IT 
SO FAR THEY'VE COPED WITH GOING BACK TO WORK 
NO NO NO OH SORRY 
DEALT WITH THEIR EX 
EVERYTHING I DO YOU THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
PLEASE DON'T WAKE ME IT'S NOT A PROBLEM IT IS A PROBLEM 
STRIPPED OFF TO BOOST THEIR SELF ESTEEM 
NO ONE WILL BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL THEM I DID THIS 
AND DATED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS 
ARE YOU READY FOR A MAN PRETTY MUCH 
AND THE YOUNG MUMS HAVE ALSO HAD TO COPE WITH THE ARRIVAL OF A YOUNG DAD 
HE'S NOT BAD LOOKING 
I FALL IN LOVE WITH EVERY PRETTY GIRL I SEE 
TONIGHT SABITA TAKES OVER AS LEADER 
AND LIFE IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFERENT 
WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THE MANSION AND GO ON HOLIDAY 
FOR SOME OF THE SINGLE PARENTS THIS IS THEIR FIRST EVER HOLIDAY 
OH MY GOD WE'RE FLYING TOGETHER CHARLIE 
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO DO I WANTED TO GET OUT AND JUST GO MAD 
CAN THE YOUNG MUMS' MANSION WORK ABROAD 
CHEESE 
IT DEFINITELY FEELS LIKE A FAMILY HOLIDAY 
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT 
OR IS GOING ON HOLIDAY TOGETHER A STEP TOO FAR 
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL GOING TO BE SHARING 
AND NOW I'M DISAPPOINTED FINDING IT'S ONLY THE FOUR OF US THAT ARE SHARING 
I WISH I'D STAYED BACK AT THE MANSION THIS IS HIDEOUS 
THIS WAS A REALLY BAD IDEA 
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO MORE STRESSFUL THAN AT HOME 
I MEAN YOU CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE IN A BIG GROUP IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE 
THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE 
NEARLY THREE WEEKS IN 
AND THE MANSION IS WAKING UP TO THE START OF A NEW LEADERSHIP 
OH YOU'RE SO SMART 
LOOK AT MY FACE DO NOT DO IT 
IN THE PAST LEADERS HAVE ORGANISED THE SHARING OF CHORES AND CHILDCARE 
BUT TODAY THINGS ARE DIFFERENT 
THEIR NEW LEADER IS TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MOTHER OF TWO SABITA 
AND SHE THINKS THE SINGLE PARENTS DESERVE A BREAK 
I THINK THIS IS THE EASIEST 
GOING ON HOLIDAY 
AND I DON'T HAVE TO GIVE CHORES OUT LIKE HOUSEWORK AND STUFF 
SO IT SHOULD BE PRETTY EASY I HOPE 
I THINK KIDS NEED A LOT OF 
ACTIVITIES TO DO DURING THEIR HOLIDAY 
AND ALSO THINGS WE CAN DO AS A GROUP 
I JUST WANT EVERYONE TO HAVE FUN REALLY AND RELAX 
SABITA LIVES IN CHATHAM WITH HER TWO SONS LENNOX AND THEO 
SINCE HER HUSBAND WAS DEPORTED THREE YEARS AGO LIFE AS A SINGLE MOTHER HAS BEEN TOUGH 
IT WAS REALLY HARD AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT I CAN'T COPE 
BUT I JUST HAD TO 
KISS IT BETTER 
IT'S A STRUGGLE EVERY WEEK 
YOU HAVE TO BE BOTH PARENTS YOU HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING BY YOURSELF 
AND IT'S JUST ALL ON ME REALLY 
ALL RIGHT BOYS 
LIKE MANY SINGLE MUMS SABITA JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO TRAVEL 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT SINGLE MUMS SHOULD GO ON HOLIDAY 
BECAUSE THEY NEED A BREAK AS WELL 
WHOO MY KIDS HAVE NEVER BEEN AWAY ON HOLIDAY 
SO IF WE DID GO ABROAD I'D MAKE THE MOST OF IT 
SINCE COMING TO THE MANSION SABITA HAS BEEN ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS 
DO I HAVE GOOD WRIST ACTION 
AND AN OFFER OF A JOB FROM HER NEW BOSS RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF HER HUSBAND OLBY RETURNING FROM NIGERIA 
THEO'S GONNA GET TO SEE HIS DAD 
SHE'S ALSO CONFRONTED HER BODY ISSUES 
WHEN YOU'RE TOLD FROM EVERY SINGLE DAY WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG CHILD THAT YOU'RE FAT AND UGLY 
THEN OBVIOUSLY THAT'S GOING TO STICK IN YOUR HEAD ISN'T IT 
DID YOU THINK YOU COULD DO THIS NOT IN A MILLION YEARS 
BUT HER BIGGEST CHALLENGE HAS ALWAYS BEEN DEALING WITH HER PAINFUL CHILDHOOD 
MY DAD WAS LIKE AN ALCOHOLIC HE WAS ABUSIVE 
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY 
I REMEMBER AT THE AGE OF FIVE JUST GOING DOWNSTAIRS 
AND MY MUM WAS LIKE COVERED IN BLOOD 
JUST SITTING THERE AND MY MUM'S SISTERS CLEANING HER HER CUTS AND STUFF 
SABITA IS ON HER WAY TO HER FIRST MANSION MEETING AS LEADER 
I DON'T WANT EVERYONE TO BE MISERABLE AND STRESSED OUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE 
I'LL TRY TO BE AS FAIR AS POSSIBLE 
BUT ALSO I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO JUST TAKE THE PISS AND NOT CONSIDER THE WHOLE GROUP 
THE REST OF THE MUMS AND SINGLE DAD BRETT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEIR NEW LEADER HAS GOT IN STORE FOR THEM 
HI HI 
HELLO 
HOW IS EVERYONE GOOD THANKS 
GOOD ANYWAY I'M GOING TO BE YOUR LEADER FOR THE NEXT FOUR DAYS 
WHILE I'M LEADER THINGS WILL BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
THAT IS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THE MANSION 
TO GO ON HOLIDAY 
WHERE ARE WE GOING WHERE ARE WE GOING I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME CLUES 
SWIMMING BEACH TOWEL 
FACTOR TWENTY FIVE 
SANGRIA YEAH 
RIGHT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO MARBELLA 
MARBELLA WHOO MARBELLA IS LIKE THE ESSEX GIRL PLACE ISN'T IT 
I'M GOING TO BE IN MY ELEMENT 
I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT GOING TO MARBELLA 
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN ON HOLIDAY WITH MY KIDS 
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO SPAIN SO THIS IS LIKE MY IDEAL HOLIDAY 
SO I'M REALLY REALLY EXCITED 
I'M REALLY EXCITED BUT I'M ALSO NERVOUS I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A PLANE 
SORRY HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN ON A PLANE NO 
I HAVE ONE CONCERN AND WHAT IS THAT 
WHEN I GO ON HOLIDAY I'M ON HOLIDAY 
AND I DO FIVE STAR HOTEL HOLIDAYS 
AND I'M REALLY WORRIED THAT YOU'RE GOING TO STICK US IN CARAVANS 
OR SOMETHING IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A CARAVAN 
IT'S A TENT THEN NO IT'S NOT A TENT BUNGALOW 
O. K. YOU'LL FIND OUT WHEN YOU GET THERE 
APART FROM THAT I INTEND TO LIVE THE MARBELLA LIFESTYLE WHILE I'M THERE O. K. 
BEFORE THE GROUP CAN GO ANYWHERE THERE'S STILL AN UNRESOLVED MATTER 
AS YOU KNOW NATASHA GARDNER IS NOT HERE FROM LAST NIGHT SHE'S STILL NOT BACK 
THERE'S ABOUT TWO MUMS LOOKING AFTER EVERYBODY'S KIDS IN THIS HOUSE 
IT'S NOT FAIR 
FED UP WITH CHORES AND CHILDCARE TWENTY FOUR HOURS AGO TASHA TOOK HER FIVE YEAR OLD SON RORY AND WALKED OUT 
WHERE'S TASHA I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T SEEN HER ALL DAY 
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME SHE'S DISAPPEARED 
YEAH I'M GOING HOME 
IF I'M NOT BACK I'M NOT BACK 
UP TILL NOW SHE'S HAD AN UNSETTLED TIME IN THE MANSION 
ARE YOU DEFINITELY LEAVING RIGHT NOW 
YES DOES NOT ANYONE UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M GOING MEANS 
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE SHE'S GONE 
AND THE MUMS ARE NOT HAPPY 
WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH TASHA GETS GOING 
YEAH AND EVERYONE IS LEFT TO PICK UP HER SHIT POO 
ALTHOUGH SHE'S HARDLY BEEN HERE I WOULDN'T WANT RORY TO MISS OUT 
SHE WOULD HAVE TO LIKE CHANGE HER ATTITUDE TOWARDS US AND THE GROUP O. K. 
IF IT WASN'T FOR RORY THEN WHY SHOULD SHE COME 
SHE DOESN'T DESERVE IT AT ALL 
I DON'T THINK SHE DOES I THINK OTHER PEOPLE DESERVE IT A LOT MORE 
ALL RIGHT WE'LL WAIT UNTIL SHE COMES BACK AND THEN WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE MEETING 
TO TELL HER HOW WE FEEL THAT WE DON'T WANT NO ATMOSPHERE ON HOLIDAY BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUN 
IS EVERYONE HAPPY THEN YEAH YEAH WHOO 
THE COACH TO THE AIRPORT LEAVES AT MIDNIGHT 
BUT THERE'S STILL NO SIGN OF TASHA 
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE A GROUP THING NONE OF US HAS JUST LEFT AND GONE HOME AND SOD EVERYONE ELSE 
ALL RIGHT SHE MAY NOT HAVE RORY OVER THE WEEKEND BUT SHE'S STILL PART OF A COMMUNE AND SHOULD PULL HER WEIGHT 
MAYBE PEOPLE ARE THINKING 
IS SHE'S JUST GOING TO SWAN BACK INTO THE HOUSE 
LAST MINUTE COME ON HOLIDAY AND JUST PROBABLY BE MISERABLE THERE 
SHE RILES ME BECAUSE SHE HAS BUGGERED OFF 
NOT TELLING ANYONE WHERE SHE'S GOING AND SHE'S EXPECTED TO GO ON A BLOODY HOLIDAY 
I DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD BE ALLOWED 
WELL I SERIOUSLY THINK WE SHOULD JUST DO A VOTE 
JUST SAY LOOK WHO WANTS HER TO GO AND WHO DOESN'T YEAH 
AND SAY BASE IT ON HER NOT RORY YEAH 
TASHA FINALLY RETURNS 
HELLO GIRLS YOU ALL RIGHT 
AND SABITA CALLS A MEETING 
RIGHT WE'RE HAVING THIS MEETING COS WE NEED TO SORT OUT STUFF ABOUT WHY NATASHA WENT HOME 
IT FEELS TO ME THAT UM 
IF YOU STAMP YOUR FEET AND SCREAM AND SHOUT YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT 
AND THIS WEEKEND WAS JUST THE LAST STRAW 
THE FACT THAT YOU NOT JUST WENT HOME THIS WEEKEND 
BUT YOU'VE BEEN HOME EVERY WEEKEND AND WE WERE ALL LOOKING FOR YOU 
NOBODY KNEW WHERE YOU WERE 
ME AND RORY'S DAD HAVE A COURT ORDER O. K. 
IT STIPULATES WHEN ROB SEES RORY AND WHEN HE DOESN'T 
RORY'S DAD WON'T DO ANY OF THE JOURNEYS SO I HAVE TO DO THE JOURNEYS 
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND THREE HOURS EVERY WEEK DRIVING BACK AND FORTH FROM HERE TO BATH 
AND TO BATH AND BACK AGAIN BUT I HAVE TO 
SO YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT 
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT BUT I HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S A COURT ORDER AND IT HAS TO BE DONE 
I HAVEN'T CONSIDERED GOING HOME BECAUSE I SIGNED UP FOR THIS FOR A MONTH 
AND YOU'VE BEEN HOME EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND 
I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT RORY HAVING TO GO TO HIS DAD'S 
BUT HE GOES ON FRIDAY YOU COLLECT HIM ON SUNDAY SO WHAT HAPPENS TO SATURDAY 
I THINK WE'LL DO A VOTE 
ON IF WE WANT NATASHA AND RORY TO COME 
PLEASE BE HONEST IT'S ALL ANONYMOUS SO NO ONE WILL KNOW 
SHALL I READ THEM OUT THEN YEAH 
THAT'S A NO NO 
NO 
NO NO 
YES YES YES 
YES 
SO WE'VE GOT FOUR YESES AND FIVE NOS 
IT'S ALL RIGHT I KNOW THE OUTCOME COS I'VE BEEN STOOD OUTSIDE LISTENING 
DO YOU KNOW THAT THERE WERE FIVE NOS AND FOUR YESES FIVE NOS FOUR YESES O. K. 
AND IF TASHA CAN'T GO ON THE HOLIDAY NEITHER CAN SON RORY 
YOU'VE SEEN WHAT HE'S LIKE IN THAT HOUSE 
HE NEVER LEAVES ANY OF THOSE KIDS ALONE FROM HARRISON WHO'S EIGHTEEN WEEKS RIGHT UP TO ALEX WHO'S TEN 
HE'S OBSESSED WITH ALL OF 'EM IT'S GONNA BREAK HIS HEART NOT TO BE ABLE TO GO ON THIS HOLIDAY 
AND IT'LL BREAK MY HEART TO BE STUCK IN THAT HOUSE FOR THREE DAYS KNOWING HE WANTS TO GO ON THAT HOLIDAY 
JOINING TASHA AND RORY IN THE MANSION WILL BE 
ROBYN AND HER DAUGHTER KELCI AS THEY DON'T HAVE PASSPORTS 
WE ARE OFF TO SUNNY SPAIN 
Y. VIVA ESPANA 
OH MY GOD AAAGH 
I'M REALLY EXCITED ACTUALLY CAN'T WAIT TO GET THERE 
WE'RE STARTING ON THE RUNWAY OH MY GOD HERE WE GO 
OH MY GOD IT'S LIKE GOING ON A ROLLERCOASTER RIDE REALLY 
ARE WE IN THE AIR OH MY GOD 
WE'RE IN THE AIR 
OH MY GOD WE ARE FLYING TOGETHER CHARLIE IT'S AMAZING 
OH I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HERE 
I'M SO HAPPY IT'S ALL BEEN WORTH IT NOW 
ALL THE SHIT I'VE BEEN THROUGH IN THAT HOUSE IT'S ALL BEEN WORTH IT 
WATCH OUT FOR THE SEA THERE IT IS 
CAN YOU SEE IT NOW 
WATER 
EVEN WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL FRIENDS WOULD SAY I'VE BEEN TO SPAIN ABOUT A HUNDRED TIMES 
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO SPAIN 
AND NOW I'M TWENTY SEVEN AND I'M IN SPAIN WITH MY KIDS IT'S WICKED 
FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS THEY'LL BE STAYING IN THIS CAMPSITE 
OH IT'S MY WORST NIGHTMARE 
LOOK AT IT 
AND AFTER TRAVELLING FOR EIGHT HOURS 
THEY HAVE TO WAIT IN THE CAMPSITE RESTAURANT BEFORE SEEING THE ACCOMMODATION 
I BELIEVED WE'D BE IN A HOTEL REALLY BELIEVED IT 
SO WE'RE IN THE POOR PEOPLE'S PART 
NO THAT'S NOT RIGHT DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
LIFE SHOULD BE EASY YES THERE ARE UPS AND DOWNS AND THERE ARE CHALLENGES THAT EVERYBODY FACES 
BUT ON THE WHOLE LIFE SHOULDN'T BE A DAY TO DAY STRUGGLE 
THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD TONI THE OLDEST IN THE GROUP HAS A MORE COMFORTABLE LIFE THAN MOST SINGLE MUMS 
I HAVE GOT A NICE LIFE 
BEING A SINGLE MUM I FIND IT QUITE EASY 
THE EASY LIFE THAT TONI AND HER KIDS ALEX AND SARAH ENJOY IS DOWN IN PART 
TO THE SUPPOSEDLY PERFECT RELATIONSHIP SHE HAS WITH THE MAN SHE DIVORCED FOUR YEARS AGO 
WE DO OUR FAMILY HOLIDAY I TAKE THE CHILDREN AWAY ONCE A YEAR 
JOHN TAKES THE CHILDREN AWAY ONCE A YEAR AND THEN WE TAKE THEM AWAY TOGETHER ONCE A YEAR 
IN THE MANSION HOWEVER LIFE WITH THE OTHER SINGLE MUMS HASN'T QUITE GONE AS PLANNED 
ALL I'VE SEEN HER DO IS SIT THERE WITH HER BABY IN A ROCKER AND NOT MOVE OFF HER ARSE 
BUT SHE HAS REVEALED THAT SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT IS MISSING FROM HER LIFE AT HOME 
SEX IS SOMETHING YOU DO WHEN YOU WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN AND I'VE HAD MY CHILDREN SO IT'S UNNECESSARY 
I'M ABOUT TO GO IN FOR SEX THERAPY 
IT WOULDN'T BOTHER ME IF SOMEBODY SAID I WOULD NEVER EVER HAVE SEX AS LONG AS I LIVE 
I'D THINK THANK GOD FOR THAT 
BUT ONE THING SHE CAN'T GO WITHOUT IS A HOLIDAY 
I'VE BEEN ABROAD FIVE TIMES IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS 
BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED LIFE'S TOO SHORT 
YOU KNOW SO I WANNA GO ON HOLIDAY SO I WILL GO ON HOLIDAY 
I CAN'T BEAR HER BEING REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC 
IT'S GONNA DO MY HEAD IN 
SEE WHAT I MEAN SHUT UP 
WHILE SABITA HEADS OFF TO CHECK OUT THE ACCOMMODATION 
THE REST OF THE GROUP ATTEMPT TO HAVE LUNCH AT THE CAMPSITE RESTAURANT 
SIT YOURSELF AT THE TABLE AND HAVE A LOOK AND ASK EVERYBODY ELSE 
THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT I SAID I SAID THIS IS MY WORST NIGHTMARE 
FOR TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD MARIGOLD IT'S NOT THE HOLIDAY THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
REALLY YEAH WHY 
COS I'M FEELING STRESSED ALREADY 
CHILDREN RUNNING AROUND THE RESTAURANT WITH THOSE GLASSES ON THE TABLE 
I'M JUST STARTING TO THINK THIS WAS A REALLY BAD IDEA 
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE MORE STRESSFUL THAN BEING HOME 
IT'S JUST ALL THE MUMS GOING ON AT THEIR KIDS AND ALL THE KIDS JUST SQUEALING 
I JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT REALLY 
I CAN'T BE DOING WITH LIKE MEALS OUT WITH ALL THEM EVERY DAY 
I JUST WANNA GO OFF WITH ME AND ERNIE AND GO AND STAY SOMEWHERE AND RELAX 
AND NOT THINK ABOUT ANYONE ELSE OR ANYONE ELSE'S KIDS THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO NOW 
WHILE THE REST OF THE GROUP FINALLY SETTLE DOWN TO EAT SABITA FACES HER FIRST TEST AS LEADER 
SHE MAY NOT HAVE TO ASSIGN CHORES AND CHOOSE WHO'S GOING OUT TO WORK 
BUT SHE WILL HAVE TO PERSUADE THE SINGLE PARENTS TO SHARE ACCOMMODATION 
NOT GONNA LIKE THAT 
SOME OF THE MUMS AREN'T USED TO THINGS LIKE CABINS THEY'RE USED TO FIVE STAR HOTELS 
I JUST WANNA HAVE FUN SPEND SOME TIME WITH MY KIDS AND I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO HAVE ANY PROBLEMS 
WHICH I KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE PROBLEMS COS OF THE ACCOMMODATION 
BUT TO BE HONEST I'M JUST GONNA SAY YOU KNOW WHAT BE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU GOT 
I WANT EVERYONE TO STICK TOGETHER AND JUST BE A BIG GROUP 
WHETHER THEY WILL OR NOT I DON'T KNOW THAT'S THE WAY I WANT IT TO BE 
RIGHT I GOT THE ACCOMMODATION 
SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO SHARE 
WHAT I'VE ARRANGED IS MARIGOLD AND TERESINA TO SHARE 
DANIELLE YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN WITH ARMARI 
AND SO IS BRETT AND TONI AND ME WITH OUR KIDS 
NATASHA AND SHELLEY TO SHARE 
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL SHARING AND NOW I'M DISAPPOINTED 
FINDING THAT ITS ONLY FOUR OF US THAT ARE SHARING 
BEARING IN MIND THAT OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO GO TO BED AT DIFFERENT TIMES 
AND WAKE AT DIFFERENT TIMES IT'S NOT IDEAL 
SHELLEY AND JACK AFTER HALF PAST SIX CAN'T MAKE ANY NOISE 
COS MY SON'S ASLEEP 
THEY'RE GONNA BE WOKEN UP AT SIX HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE MORNING WHEN HE WAKES UP 
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN TAKE HIM AWAY ANYWHERE 
THERE WON'T BE ANOTHER ROOM 
WHOEVER SHARES WITH ME WILL BE WOKEN UP AT SIX HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE MORNING 
ALL RIGHT I'M GOING TO GET YOU TO LIE DOWN IN A MINUTE 
BEAUTIFUL WEATHER A NICE BIT TO EAT 
BUT IT'S STRANGE HOW A FEW OF THE MUMS 
STILL HAVE SOMETHING TO MOAN ABOUT 
I SUPPOSE THEY CAN ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING BUT SEEMS TO BE A LOT AT THE MOMENT 
MAYBE IT'S A WOMAN THING I DUNNO 
AFTER MAKING HER FEELINGS KNOWN AT LUNCH NATASHA HAS WON HER WAY 
SHE AND HER FOUR MONTH OLD BABY HARRISON ARE SHARING A CABIN WITH EACH OTHER 
THERE'S A BIG BED FOR YOU 
AND A BIG BED FOR ME 
YOU'LL HAVE TO SLEEP IN THE CORNER SO YOU DON'T ROLL OFF 
WHAT'S YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS LIKE IT I DO LIKE IT I LIKE IT A LOT 
I THINK IT'S REALLY SWEET I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE FINE 
THIS IS SHELLEY MY NEIGHBOUR 
IT'S QUITE NARROW WAIT 
WHAT'S THAT A BATHROOM TWO SINGLE BEDS 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH YOUR ROOM YEAH FINE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE JUST SAID 
THIS IS OUR WENDY HOUSE SPOT ON 
WELCOME TO YOUR WENDY HOUSE 
WHERE'S THE WINDOWS 
I LIKE IT BUT THERE'S JUST ONE REALLY BIG DETAIL IT'S TOO SMALL 
I WENT IN THERE AND I WAS CRAMPED 
BUT IT'S NOT THE SIZE OF HIS CABIN THAT'S WORRYING THREE YEAR OLD ERNIE IT'S SECURITY 
WHO'S THE NASTY ONE NO ONE 
WELL IF A NASTY ONE COMES AT US I'LL QUICKLY GRAB THIS 
AND DO THIS AT HIM 
AND THEN I'LL SMASH ERNIE THAT'S NOT VERY NICE IS IT 
BUT IF A NASTY MAN COMES THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO 
THAT ONE'S BIG IS IT 
THAT'S TONI'S AND SHE'LL STILL NOT BE HAPPY SHE'S GOT THE BIGGEST ONE 
THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT CARAVANS ARE POSH 
IT SOUNDS REALLY SNOBBY BUT THIS IS NOT FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ERNIE I LOVE IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ALEX 
NOT QUITE EGYPT IS IT MATE IT'S A MIDGET HOUSE 
I WAS SO MUCH ON A HIGH WHEN I COME HERE AND I JUST FEEL 
I'M GONNA CONCENTRATE ON MYSELF AND I'VE COME HERE TO ENJOY MYSELF 
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH MY MIND IS I WISH I'D STAYED BACK AT THE MANSION 
THIS IS HIDEOUS 
BACK IN SOMERSET HOME ALONE MUMS TASHA AND ROBYN ARE PLANNING HOW THEY'RE 
GOING TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR PRECIOUS TIME AWAY FROM THE GROUP 
GENERAL PLAN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS TO ENJOY OURSELVES AND HAVE FUN 
AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY THAT EVERYONE'S MOANING AND BITCHING 
LIKE TODAY WE GOT UP AND WE WANTED TO GO BOWLING SO WE WENT 
IF ALL OF US WERE HERE WE WOULD'VE HAD TO ARRANGE IT HAVE A MEETING ABOUT IT 
I'LL LAUGH MY HEAD OFF IF THEY COME BACK AND SAY THEY'VE BEEN STUCK ON A CAMPSITE FOR THE PAST FOUR DAYS 
WAHEY WELL DONE 
I THINK WE'VE GOT THE BETTER DEAL BEING HERE 
WE'RE WARM 
CHEERS TO THE GUYS AND WHATEVER SHIT PIT THEY'RE IN 
IN SPAIN DESPITE SOME COMPLAINTS SABITA IS DETERMINED TO ENJOY HER FIRST EVER HOLIDAY 
SHE'S ORGANISED THE FIRST GROUP ACTIVITY 
THEY'LL BE SPENDING THE AFTERNOON AT THE CAMPSITE SWIMMING POOL 
I'VE GOT MY CAMERA ON ME RIGHT 
AND IT'S STILL GOT MY EGYPT PHOTOS ON IT 
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT A HOLIDAY IS 
HER LIFESTYLE'S A BIT DIFFERENT TO MINE 
SHE'S GOT A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM HER EX HUSBAND I HAVEN'T 
BASICALLY I DON'T GET NOTHING FROM LENNOX'S DAD 
AND THEO'S DAD IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT 
THE LITTLE MONEY I GET IS TO FEED MY KIDS 
I COULDN'T EVEN AFFORD TO GO ANYWHERE IN ENGLAND LET ALONE COME ABROAD 
SO THIS IS LIKE LUXURY TO ME 
NINETEEN YEAR OLD TERESINA HAS DECIDED SHE NEEDS TIME AWAY FROM THE GROUP 
THOUGH THIS WAS HER FIRST TIME ON A PLANE SHE'S VISITED SPAIN BEFORE BY BOAT 
THIS TRIP IS BRINGING BACK SOME PAINFUL MEMORIES 
I CAME TO SPAIN AS A CHILD SANTANDER 
WHEN I WAS SIX 
THEN WE TRAVELLED LOADS 
UNTIL I WAS LIKE FOURTEEN 
I REALLY ENJOYED MY CHILDHOOD 
YOU JUST THINK THE FAMILY THAT YOU HAVE IS YOUR LIFE AND THAT'S HOW LIFE IS AND THEN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY 
EXPERIENCE OTHER PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY GO THROUGH 
AND I JUST REALISED THAT I HAD A BIT OF A HARD TIME 
BACK IN BRITAIN TERESINA LIVES IN THIS COUNCIL HOUSE IN GLASTONBURY 
BUT AS A CHILD SHE HAD NO FIXED ADDRESS 
HER MOTHER ALSO A LONE PARENT KEPT HER FAMILY ON THE MOVE AND HOME EDUCATED ALL HER CHILDREN 
UP TO A POINT 
MY MUM KICKED ME OUT WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN 
OH MY GOD 
SINCE ENTERING THE MANSION TERESINA HAS BEGUN 
TO FIND THE SELF CONFIDENCE SHE LACKED GROWING UP 
THE FIRST PERSON I'VE GOT TO GO TO WORK IS TERESINA 
WE NEED TO MAKE THE CLIENT FEEL SPECIAL EVERYONE'S SPECIAL EVERYONE'S SPECIAL 
SHE'S EVEN PERSUADED HER EX JOHN TO BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN THEIR SON'S LIFE 
SO YOU DON'T THINK THAT I SHOULD GET A BREAK ANY TIME 
HELLO BEAUTIFUL HE'S DRAWING 
THERE WILL BE A TIME WHERE I'LL BE MORE STABLE AND I'LL BE WITH SOMEBODY THAT'S STABLE HOPEFULLY 
TERESINA HAS NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY HER MOTHER LET HER GO SO EASILY 
I GUESS WHEN SHE LIKE TOLD ME TO GO SHE WAS SORT OF TRYING TO SAY TO ME TO LIVE LIFE HOW YOU WANT TO 
LIVE IT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT HAPPY AT HOME AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE UNHAPPY AROUND ME 
AND THAT WOULD MAKE THE FAMILY UNHAPPY 
AND IT WAS I JUST FELT LIKE I WAS A SLAVE 
AND I JUST FELT I WAS WORTH MORE 
SINCE CHARLIE WAS BORN 
SHE WANTS TO BE MORE PART OF MY LIFE AND 
SHE REALLY LIKES CHARLIE 
AND SHE WANTS TO BE THERE FOR CHARLIE I THINK 
I DON'T KNOW 
HELLO THE WANDERER RETURNS 
TERESINA AND CHARLIE HAVE BEEN AWAY FROM THE GROUP FOR OVER FIVE HOURS 
YEAH IS TERESINA BACK YEAH 
WHERE IS SHE IN HER ROOM I'M BUSY I'LL SEE YOU LATER 
OH ARE YOU 
O. K. THEN 
THAT'S O. K. WITH ME 
WE WAS ONLY JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU BUT YOU CAN TELL ME LATER 
IT'S NINE P. M. AS FAR AS SABITA'S CONCERNED HER FIRST DAY IN CHARGE HASN'T QUITE GONE TO PLAN 
HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING AS A LEADER 
SHIT 
I FEEL REALLY 
REALLY FEEL LIKE I DON'T THINK I'M DOING REALLY BAD BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT 
I DON'T KNOW I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE 
I'M NOT VERY GOOD AS A LEADER I DON'T THINK 
IT STRESSFUL AND IT'S REALLY PEEING ME OFF 
YOU CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE IN A BIG GROUP YOU JUST CAN'T IT'S NOT POSSIBLE 
WITH COMPLAINTS ABOUT ACCOMMODATION AND TERESINA DESERTING THE GROUP 
FOR THE AFTERNOON SABITA NEEDS TO GET THE HOLIDAY BACK ON TRACK 
I JUST WANT TO DO A QUICK MEETING TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON TOMORROW 
WHAT THE KIDS WOULD LIKE TO DO TOMORROW BASICALLY 
COME ON KIDS THEO CALM DOWN 
THERE'S QUITE A FEW THINGS WE COULD DO WE COULD GO TO THE ZOO AND THEN 
MAYBE GO TO THE BEACH AFTERWARDS BECAUSE THE BEACH IS NEARBY 
IF I COULD FIND OUT BY TOMORROW MORNING BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED SOME ORGANISING IF WE ARE GOING TO DO IT 
ALSO TERESINA CAN I FIND OUT WHERE YOU WENT TODAY 
YEAH I WENT FOR A LITTLE WALK 
O. K. CAN YOU DO US A FAVOUR 
IF YOU WANT TIME ON YOUR OWN CAN YOU JUST SAY YOU'RE GOING 
COS I WAS WORRIED AND THINKING WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU GONE O. K. 
JUST SO THAT I KNOW AND DON'T HAVE TO WORRY IS THAT COOL WITH EVERYONE 
YES THAT IS COOL RIGHT THAT'S ALL DONE MY HEAD IN A BIT 
SHE SAID THE KIDS AND THE ADULTS ARE GOING TO BE DOING IT TOGETHER 
MY POINT IS I DIDN'T SPEND THE AFTERNOON WITH THE GROUP 
YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT 
SO I PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE 
I SHOULD 
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY'RE GOING TO BITCH ABOUT ME 
DON'T CARE WHAT THEY THINK 
NO BUT I DO CARE THAT THEY'LL BITCH ABOUT ME BECAUSE I'D RATHER THEY DO IT IF I WAS THERE 
I THOUGHT SABITA SAID THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THINGS 
IT WAS ALL ABOUT HAVING A NICE HOLIDAY 
THE EMPHASIS WASN'T ON A GROUP I DIDN'T THINK 
BUT THEN TONIGHT AT THE MEETING THE EMPHASIS WAS ON DOING THINGS AS A GROUP 
WHEREAS I HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT IF YOU WANTED TO GO OFF AND DO YOUR OWN THING THAT WAS FINE 
IT'S NOT JUST THE ADULTS THAT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SABITA'S PLAN FOR THE MORNING 
I'M NOT REALLY INTO SEEING DOLPHINS AND CRAP LIKE THAT 
YOU CAN SEE I'M NOT VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO THEN 
I DON'T KNOW STUFF LIKE GO TO THE ARCADE AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
THE SINGLE PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN ARE WAKING UP TO THE SECOND DAY OF THEIR HOLIDAY 
NATASHA YEAH IT'S ME TRY AND WAKE EVERYONE UP ALL RIGHT 
IT'S ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK 
AFTER YESTERDAY LEADER SABITA WANTS EVERYONE TO ENJOY THE HOLIDAY TOGETHER 
ZOO AT TEN O'CLOCK GET UP SARAH 
BUT NOT EVERYONE IS KEEN 
HE RECKONS ZOO'S BABY STUFF I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO 
I'M EXCITED TO GO TO THE ZOO 
AND TERESINA'S FEELING A LITTLE OVERWHELMED BY THE DEMANDS OF THE LEADER AND THE GROUP 
RIGHT WE'RE GOING IF YOU'RE NOT THERE WE'RE GONNA GO LET'S GO O. O. O. O. O. O. 
COMING 
BUT SABITA DOESN'T JUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE GROUP FOR THE MORNING 
RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO THE ZOO 
WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN JUST GO OFF OUR OWN WAY 
GO TO LUNCH AND BE READY HERE BY TWO O'CLOCK SO WE CAN GO TO THE BEACH 
WOW 
THAT'S THE GAFFER HE'S THE GAFFER HE'S THE BOSS LOOK 
OH LOOK IT'S DEAD CUTE 
WITH EVERYONE FINALLY TOGETHER ON AN OUTING SOME ARE REMINDED OF WHO'S MISSING 
I DON'T THINK EITHER TASHA OR ROBYN WOULD LIKE A HOLIDAY HOUSE 
ROBYN WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO COPE WITHOUT MODERN TECHNOLOGIES 
ROBYN WOULD STILL BE IN BED ANYWAY SO SHE WOULD HAVE MISSED ALL THIS AS WELL WHAT PIE DO YOU WANT 
BUT BACK IN ENGLAND ROBYN IS UP 
STEAK MINCE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE JOINING THE COMMUNE SHE'S ACTUALLY DOING THE SHOPPING 
IT'S LUSH 
JUST SHOPPING AND WE JUST HAVE TO QUICKLY ASK EACH OTHER WHAT WE BOTH LIKE WHAT WE BOTH WANT 
DUMP IT IN THE TROLLEY AND THAT'S IT GO 
NO WHO WANTS WHAT 
HAS IT GOT SOYA HAS IT GOT WHEAT IN IT HAS IT GOT GLUTEN IN IT 
AND ALL THE REST OF IT WE MIGHT NOT BE IN HOLIDAY FOR FOUR DAYS BUT WE'VE STILL GOT TO EAT PROPERLY 
IF I WAS ON MY OWN I'D BE GETTING MICROWAVE STUFF 
BUT SHE CAN COOK AND I CAN'T 
I KNOW WHEN I'M ON HOLIDAY THE ONE THING I DO MISS THE MOST IS MY ENGLISH FOOD 
YOU KNOW YOUR LITTLE LUXURY ITEMS THAT YOU CAN'T GET WHEN YOU'RE ABROAD 
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THE KIDS WILL BE MISSING THAT REALLY REALLY BADLY 
AND I EXPECT THERE'S SOME MUMS OUT THERE WHO ARE GOING TO BE OH I WANT MY 
I WANT MY WHEAT FREE DIET 
IT'S LUNCHTIME IN SPAIN 
I WOULDN'T GIVE MY KIDS THAT FOOD IF YOU PAID ME 
BUT ERNIE'S FUSSY AND HE'LL EAT CHIPS SO I'M GONNA GIVE HIM CHIPS 
BUT I'LL MAKE SURE HE HAS APPLE JUICE AND OTHER THINGS TODAY THAT ARE HEALTHY FOR HIM 
THEY'VE GOT LIKE PINTS OF COKE BURGERS AND CHIPS 
YOU'RE HAVING BURGER AND CHIPS FOR LUNCH 
I KNOW OH IT DOESN'T MATTER DOES IT 
BUT IN THE MANSION WE'RE LIVING WITH VEGGIES AND THEY MAKE US EAT VEGETABLES ALL THE TIME 
IF I HAD A WEIGHT PROBLEM I'D MAKE DAMN SURE MY CHILDREN DIDN'T EAT THAT SORT OF STUFF 
THAT'S JUST HOW I FEEL 
I RECKON TOWN CENTRE'S OVER THERE SOMEWHERE 
SPENDING THE WHOLE MORNING WITH THE GROUP IS ENOUGH FOR MARIGOLD AND TERESINA 
I KNOW BUT THEY DO CHAIN SMOKE DON'T THEY 
HMM THEY DO CHAIN SMOKE 
THAT LOT YEAH 
IT IS LIKE 
THEY'RE EATING BURGERS AND CHIPS AND THEN TALKING ABOUT BUYING MORE BURGERS AND CHIPS FOR THE BARBECUE 
IT'S LIKE OH HOW CAN YOU THINK ABOUT BUYING BURGERS NOW 
TERESINA AND MARIGOLD HAVE GONE OFF SOMEWHERE IF THEY WANT TO GO OFF THEY GO OFF 
SO I'M STILL GOING TO THE BEACH 
MOST OF US ARE SO YOU'D RATHER THEM STAYED WITH YOU 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE BUT THAT'S LIFE INNIT 
AHH 
MY KNICKERS 
OH MY GOD MY KNICKERS ARE WET THEY'RE SOAKING 
THEY WON'T MISS US BUT THEN THEY'LL ANNOYED THAT WE WEREN'T THERE COS WE WEREN'T THERE 
EVEN THOUGH THEY WON'T CARE THAT WE WEREN'T THERE REALLY 
AND THEY'LL PROBABLY BE HAVING A BETTER TIME WITHOUT US 
GO 
ALL THE SINGLE MOTHERS MAY NOT BE TOGETHER BUT THE ONES WHO ARE 
ARE ENJOYING THE BENEFITS OF HOLIDAYING IN A GROUP 
I'M HAVING FUN 
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO DO I WANTED TO GET OUT AND JUST GO MAD 
DEFINITELY FEELS LIKE A FAMILY HOLIDAY 
ESPECIALLY FOR THE KIDS BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT ALL THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH THEM 
LIKE IF WE CAME HERE BY THEMSELVES JACK WOULD PROBABLY BE BORED 
IT'S A LOT OF FUN BECAUSE WE'RE ALL HAVING GIGGLES 
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR WHAT A COUPLE OF WEEKS NOW SO IT'S LIKE A CLOSE FAMILY UNIT 
THERE'S ALL THE MUMS TO TAKE OVER LIKE NOW I'M SITTING HERE 
THERE'S A MUM TO WATCH HIM IN CASE HE RUNS IN THE WATER I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT NORMALLY 
I'M BEACH 
I BEACH 
I WOULDN'T LIKE SHELLEY SHE'S GONE FOR IT 
I THINK I'LL WAIT UNTIL I'M BACK IN EGYPT 
I DON'T FEEL THE URGE TO GO FOR IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE SEA 
MARIGOLD AND TERESINA ARE AT THE BEACH 
THEY'RE FURTHER DOWN THERE OR SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITH US 
SO THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID THAT IF THEY WANT TO DO THAT THEY CAN THAT'S FINE BY ME 
AS LONG AS WE'RE STILL HAVING FUN IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT THEY'RE DOING DOES IT 
AWAY FROM THE GROUP TERESINA IS STILL CONSIDERING 
HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER MOTHER AND SHE WANTS SOME ADVICE 
THE THING IS I DON'T EVEN KNOW MY MUM 
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER AS A PERSON 
BECAUSE WE NEVER TALK 
MY BROTHER SAYS TO ME THE WAY SHE'S TREATED YOU WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BE ANY PART OF HER LIFE 
I'M JUST TOO FORGIVING I GUESS 
I THINK THAT WAS IN THE PAST AND PEOPLE CHANGE AND THEY DO CHANGE 
IF SHE'S NOT DOING BAD STUFF NOW IT'S PROBABLY BETTER YOU HAVE SOME RELATIONSHIP RATHER THAN NONE 
YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS JUST THINKING 
I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH ANYBODY ELSE IN THE GROUP 
WHOA 
OH MY GOD 
BACK AT THE MANSION TASHA AND ROBYN ARE GETTING USED TO LIFE WITHOUT A LEADER AND WITHOUT ANY HOUSEMATES 
IT'S ACTUALLY NICE NOT HAVING THE OTHERS AROUND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU 
IT MEANS THOUGH THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE TWO MUMS MUST DO EVERYTHING THEMSELVES 
I BET YOU THEY'RE SAT THERE TALKING ABOUT US SAYING HOW WE'RE GOING TO STARVE FOR THE NEXT HOW MANY DAYS 
THE MESS WE'RE MAKING IS OUR OWN MESS WE ONLY HAVE TO CLEAN THAT UP 
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE GOT YESTERDAY'S MESS TO CLEAR UP 
WE'RE GONNA START HAVING SOME FUN SO WE'RE GOING TO GO PLAY HIDE AND SEEK 
WE'RE GOING TO GET THE MATTRESSES AND DO SOME BODY SURFING DOWN THE STAIRS 
HOLD ONTO IT TIGHT 
IS THAT FUN 
NINE O'CLOCK IN SPAIN 
SABITA'S ORGANISED A NIGHT OUT IN MARBELLA FOR THE MUMS 
IT'S ONE WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS A GOOD TIME TOGETHER 
WHAT DO I DO OH 
SHAKE YOUR ASSETS 
SHAKE YOUR ASSETS 
TO BE IN SPAIN IS LIKE THE DREAM COME TRUE 
AND TO OTHER PEOPLE IT MIGHT SOUND STUPID 
BUT TO ME IT'S LIKE REALLY COOL 
I'M JUST OVER THE MOON HONESTLY 
IF I CRY IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M UNHAPPY IT'S BECAUSE I'M REALLY OVER THE MOON 
YEAH MY KIDS ARE LIKE THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE EVERYTHING COS LIKE 
EVEN ON THE PLANE THEY WERE LIKE OH MY GOD LOOK AT THE CLOUDS LOOK AT THEM LOOK AT THIS 
FOR TERESINA THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS IN SPAIN HAVE GIVEN HER A LOT TO THINK ABOUT 
THIS TRIP HAS MADE HER REALISE SHE WANTS TO GIVE HER MOTHER A SECOND CHANCE 
THE HOLIDAY SO FAR HAS BEEN VERY ENJOYABLE 
I'VE UM 
EXPERIENCED EVERY EMOTION IN MY SOUL THAT I CAN 
I'VE BEEN HAPPY I'VE BEEN UPSET I'VE BEEN ECSTATIC 
I HAVE BEEN SAD I HAVE BEEN IN A TEARFUL MOMENT HERE 
I TELL YOU WHAT SPAIN IS A VERY SPECIAL HOLIDAY FOR ME 
BECAUSE IT BRINGS BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES FOR ME 
AND I'VE LEARNT A FEW THINGS ALONG THE WAY 
THERE WAS HAPPINESS IN MY PAST WHICH I SORT OF KNEW BUT I JUST NEEDED REMINDING 
THERE IS HAPPINESS THERE WAS HAPPINESS BETWEEN ME AND MY FAMILY 
AS THE SINGLE PARENTS HAD BACK TO THEIR CAMPSITE IN SPAIN 
IT IS THEIR LEADER WHO HAS OVER INDULGED AGAIN 
HAVING NOT SEEN HER HUSBAND FOR THREE YEARS AND WITH A CHILDHOOD MARRED BY TRAGEDY 
SABITA HAS SEIZED EVERY OPPORTUNITY MANSION LIFE HAS GIVEN HER TO LET HER HAIR DOWN OW 
OH PISS OFF 
AND IT HAS NOT GONE UNNOTICED WITH THE OTHER MUMS 
ONE OF THE MOTHER'S COLLAPSED THROUGH ALCOHOL POISONING 
SHE DIDN'T DID SHE YES THAT IS EXACTLY WHY SHE COLLAPSED 
SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY OBLITERATED 
SHE COULDN'T WALK UP THE STAIRS 
SHE DID THAT IN TWENTY MINUTES ON HER OWN 
IF THERE IS ANOTHER NIGHT OUT IN THE MANSION I WILL NOT BE GOING 
BECAUSE I'VE LEARNT MY LESSON EVEN THOUGH OTHER PEOPLE HAVEN'T I WILL NOT MAKE THAT SAME MISTAKE AGAIN 
I HAVE MADE A DECISION THAT I WILL NOT BE LOOKING AFTER HER CHILDREN 
SHE IS GOING TO NEED TO LEARN THE HARD WAY 
IF YOU WANT TO GET IN THAT STATE YOU HAVE STILL GOT TO CARRY ON 
SHE IS NOT GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE TO PICK UP THE PIECES ALL THE TIME 
AND I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE ONE TO DO IT NO WAY 
IT'S SABITA'S FINAL DAY AS LEADER 
IS THAT MY MUM'S YEAH THAT'S YOUR MUM'S 
IT'S MUM IT'S MUM 
BUT AT NINE A M. SHE IS STILL IN BED 
TIME TO GET UP SABITA I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT 
SABITA IS LEADER 
SO YOU KNOW 
SHOW US THE WAY EH 
SO PERHAPS WE SHOULD ALL JUST STAY IN BED 
I'D QUITE LIKE SOME EXTRA SLEEP THIS MORNING YEAH ME TOO 
THE FIRST TIME I COULD SEE SHE WAS GETTING REALLY DRUNK BEFORE SHE FELL AND KNOCKED HER HEAD AND EVERYTHING 
SHE SAID SHE DRINKS TO FORGET ABOUT THE SITUATION SHE IS IN AND HER HUSBAND BEING IN NIGERIA 
SO FOR THAT MOMENT IN TIME WHEN SHE IS DRUNK SHE CAN JUST FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HAVE A GOOD TIME 
EVERY TIME SHE GETS HANGING SOMEONE LOOKS AFTER HER KIDS EXACTLY SO SHE CAN STAY IN BED 
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY SHE DOES IT ACTUALLY 
I'D QUITE APPRECIATE THAT YEAH 
I'M WASTED AND NOT ABLE TO LOOK AFTER MY CHILDREN THE NEXT DAY BRILLIANT 
I'M NOT GOING TO BE A HYPOCRITE AND SAY I NEVER GET 
I DO BUT I NEVER COME BACK TO JACK IN THAT STATE NEVER 
TODAY IS THEIR LAST FULL DAY IN SPAIN AND SABITA HAS ORGANISED A BOAT TRIP 
BUT WHETHER SHE MAKES IT IS ANOTHER THING ALTOGETHER 
FIVE PAST TEN I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE GOING AT HALF PAST DO YOU 
SABITA'S TWO SONS THEO AND LENNOX HAVE BEEN UP FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS 
I CAN'T WATCH THEM I'M TIRED AND I HAVE TO WATCH I'M REFUSING TO WATCH THEM 
I CAN'T DO IT I'M TOO TIRED 
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A ONE OFF IS IT 
NOT FAIR TO PUNISH THE KIDS BECAUSE SABITA'S 
BUT WE'RE NOT PUNISHING THE KIDS SHE IS IT'S NOT US DOING THAT IT'S HER SHE'S THE ONE WHO ARRANGED IT 
SHE IS ILL SHE'S BEEN SICK 
OH DEAR WELL BEING ASLEEP'S THE BEST THING FOR HER MAKE SURE YOU ARE QUIET AND TIPTOE AROUND HER 
BUT SHE SAID THAT SHE'S STILL GOING TO GO BOAT RIDING 
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT MUM 
WE CAN STILL GO BOAT RIDING AND YOU STAY IN AND HAVE A LITTLE REST AND GET BETTER FOR LATER ON 
BECAUSE GOING ON THE BOAT IT GOES UP AND DOWN DOESN'T IT 
AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL SICK AT THE BEST OF TIMES 
ALL I KNOW IS THAT SHE GOT HAMMERED I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE MUM'S GOT TO SAY FOR HERSELF 
BECAUSE IT'S WELL OUT OF ORDER 
I KNOW THAT MY DAD WOULD NOT DO THAT BECAUSE HE JUST HATES WOMEN GETTING DRUNK 
BECAUSE MY MUM SHE GOT DRUNK QUITE A LOT 
SO AND HE JUST DIDN'T LIKE IT SO THAT IS WHY HE NEVER 
THAT IS WHY HE JUST DIDN'T ENJOY IT 
MY MUM JUST DONE SILLY THINGS WITH ALCOHOL 
WHEN SHE DRUNK IT THE ALCOHOL WOULD JUST TAKE OVER AND SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT 
AND SHE WOULD END UP TAKING MORE ALCOHOL MORE MORE MORE 
AND THEN SHE JUST DOES SILLY THINGS WHEN SHE IS DRUNK A LITTLE BIT 
SO THAT IS WHY MY DAD REALLY HATES IT 
LENNOX COME ON 
READY FOR ACTION ANYONE SEEN MY BAG 
I'VE LOST MY BAG 
YOU ALL RIGHT YES 
THIS IS THE LAST DAY OH MY GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
AND THEN BACK TO THAT MANSION 
TASHA AND ROBYN ARE PREPARING FOR THE IMMINENT RETURN OF BRETT AND THE MUMS 
NO I AIN'T TIDYING UP FOR EVERYBODY NO WAY 
THIS IS NOTHING TO DO WITH US 
OH RORY'S PLAYED UP HERE I EXPECT AND MADE SOME OF THE MESS I WON'T DENY THAT 
BUT THIS IS 
A 
MUMS AND DADS KIDS MESS 
IT IS NOT RIGHT TO EXPECT SOMEBODY THAT WASN'T ABLE TO GO ON HOLIDAY 
OR SOMEBODY WHO WAS VOTED OFF THE HOLIDAY TO TIDY UP FOR THEM 
THIS IS AMAZING 
FOR NOW THE MANSION IS THE LAST THING ON ANYONE'S MIND 
SAY CHEESE CHEESE 
ITS NICE TO BE ON HOLIDAY WITH OTHER WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN 
IF I WENT ON ME OWN WITH MY KIDS THEY'D PROBABLY GET BORED AS WELL 
I THINK IT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA TO GO AWAY WITH A GROUP 
YOU'VE GOT COMPANY IN THE EVENING PEOPLE TO GO OUT WITH SEE EACH OTHER'S EXCITEMENT 
I MIGHT EVEN SET UP A WEBSITE WHERE SINGLE MOTHERS CAN CLICK ON AND GO ON HOLIDAYS 
IF IT HAD BEEN ME AND HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRESSFUL BUT HAVING THE OTHER MUMS IT WASN'T TOO STRESSFUL 
TONI HOW ARE YOU FEELING 
LOVELY 
DESPITE A POOR START TO THE DAY SABITA IS SATISFIED SHE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB AS LEADER 
I THINK I HAVE DONE QUITE A LOT IN THIS HOLIDAY IT HAS ONLY BEEN ABOUT THREE DAYS REALLY 
AND WE'VE FIT NEARLY WELL NOT EVERYTHING BUT WE FIT QUITE A LOT OF ACTIVITIES IN 
YEAH I'M REALLY HAPPY I THINK I'VE DONE QUITE WELL ACTUALLY 
I'M THE CAPTAIN I'M THE CAPTAIN I'M THE CAPTAIN LAND AHOY 
IT'S THE END OF THE HOLIDAY AND THE END OF SABITA'S LEADERSHIP 
TOMORROW THE GROUP RETURNS TO THE MANSION 
BEFORE THEN THE MUMS AND BRETT ARE GATHERING FOR SABITA'S FINAL MEETING AS LEADER 
GENERALLY I THINK SHE'S BEEN A GOOD LEADER 
I THINK IF I WAS BEING HONEST SHE MAY HAVE HAD IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER 
NOT HAVING THE CHORES OF THE HOUSE THE WORK THE CHILDCARE 
THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE WAY SHE BEHAVED LAST NIGHT HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST PART OF HER LEADERSHIP 
SHE GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND SOME TIME AWAY FROM THE GROUP ON THIS HOLIDAY 
BECAUSE I REALLY NEEDED IT 
I REALLY NEEDED TO BE A BIT SEPARATE AND SPEND MORE TIME AS A FAMILY 
I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE REALLY THINKING HELLO 
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE I'VE ASKED ARE THEY HAVING A GOOD TIME THEY SAID YES 
I CAN ONLY THINK IT'S BEEN GOOD THERE MIGHT BE NEGATIVE THINGS SOMETHING I HAVEN'T HEARD 
HOW IS EVERYONE O. K. 
COOL 
I JUST WANT TO KNOW A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU FELT ABOUT THE HOLIDAY 
NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE THINGS 
I'VE HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME 
NEGATIVES I THOUGHT WHEN YOU GOT DRUNK LAST NIGHT I WAS LIKE OH NO LEADER 
YOU'RE MEANT TO BE GIVING US A ROLE MODEL 
YOU DOING THAT MADE ME THINK WHAT HELP IS SHE GOING TO BE TO US IF SHE'S NOT IN A FIT STATE OF MIND 
BUT THE POSITIVE IS YOU GOT UP THIS MORNING AND YOU WERE STILL WITH US WHICH I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NOT DO 
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE LEFT WITH THE KIDS OH RIGHT YEAH 
I'VE HAD A VERY VERY NICE HOLIDAY THANK YOU I'VE REALLY LIKED IT 
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO JUST WANDER AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT I DO AT HOME 
I JUST WALK AROUND AND EXPLORE AND I'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO DO THAT AND I'VE REALLY APPRECIATED IT 
I'VE BEEN ASKED CONSTANTLY HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO YOUR OTHER HOLIDAYS 
YEAH AND IN TRUTH IT DOESN'T 
SO OBVIOUSLY THE DAY I ARRIVED I WAS A MISERABLE COW 
APOLOGIES TO EVERYBODY FOR BRINGING EVERYBODY DOWN 
I LOVED YESTERDAY I FELT LIKE A SINGLE PERSON COS I DIDN'T SEE MY CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY WERE GONE 
THAT'S COOL BY ME THAT WAS GOOD THAT THEY FELT COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO GO RUNNING OFF 
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED EVERYONE TO HAVE FUN 
NOT JUST THE KIDS THE ADULTS AS WELL 
SO I THINK I'VE DONE REALLY WELL 
I'VE DONE WHAT I PLANNED TO DO AND I FEEL REALLY PROUD ACTUALLY 
YOU SHOULD DO FOR ALL YOU LOT THAT HAVE BEEN LEADERS BEFORE I CAN SEE HOW STRESSFUL IT IS 
I JUST WANT TO PROPOSE A TOAST TO THE END OF THE HOLIDAY I JUST WANT TO SAY CHEERS 
CHEERS 
AFTER THREE DAYS AWAY 
BRETT THE MUMS AND THEIR CHILDREN ARE BACK IN ENGLAND 
LEFT LEFT LEFT OOH CAN YOU FEEL THE COLD 
THE HOLIDAY'S OVER BUT THE COMMUNE EXPERIENCE ISN'T 
TECHNICALLY I'VE GOT THE RAW END OF THE DEAL WITH SABITA'S LEADERSHIP 
BECAUSE SHE SAID THAT I WAS TO BE OFF THE HOLIDAY FOR NOT PULLING MY WEIGHT THAT WAS THEIR PUNISHMENT 
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE MY PUNISHMENT DEALT TO ME MEANING I'VE GOT TO TIDY THIS HOUSE BECAUSE I'M NOT A SLAVE 
I'M JUST THINKING WHAT KIND OF STATE THE HOUSE IS GOING TO BE IN 
IS IT GOING TO BE CLEAN WHEN I COME BACK FROM HOLIDAY I'M LIKE OH MY NICE CLEAN HOUSE RELAX 
IF IT'S A TIP I'M GOING TO BE WELL UPSET 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THEM IF THEY'VE LEFT THE HOUSE IN A HALF DECENT STATE 
IF NOT I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM 
IT'S LIKE WE'RE WAITING FOR OUR PARENTS TO COME HOME AND TELL US OFF BASICALLY 
PAYBACK TIME 
NEARLY HOME 
WAVE 
HELLO MY DARLING 
YOU HAD FUN THEN YEAH IT'S BEEN RELAXING 
HAVE YOU MISSED US NO IT'S ABSOLUTELY BLISS IT'S SO SILENT SO QUIET 
NOBODY'S MOANING THE HOUSE ISN'T 
WELL IT WAS UNTIDY BUT WE'VE HAD A CLEAN KITCHEN FOR FOUR DAYS HAVEN'T WE YEAH 
IT'S A SHITHOLE THEY'VE DONE NOTHING DOES IT HURT TO JUST TIDY UP A LITTLE BIT 
JUST AS I THOUGHT 
WHAT I'M NOT EVEN SHOWING EMOTION BECAUSE IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT THEY WOULDN'T DO SHIT 
MUMMY SO YOU THINK IT'S O. K. THAT THEY'VE LEFT IT LIKE THIS WE SHOULD JUST NOT SAY ANYTHING 
RIGHT NOW IF I SAY SOMETHING THEY'LL HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE 
THEY DON'T GIVE A SHIT THEY DON'T CARE 
THEY'RE VERY SMALL MINDED PEOPLE AND I AM NOT LIKE THAT AND I CAN'T BE AROUND PEOPLE LIKE THAT 
WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO CLEAN UP AFTER OTHER PEOPLE FUCKING SICK OF IT 
DO YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN MOANING ABOUT THE STATE OF THE HOUSE SURPRISE SURPRISE 
BOVVERED FACE BOVVERED NO 
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE PLEASED THEY CAN SEE US STRUGGLING NOW WE'RE BACK AND I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY NICE 
THEY WERE ON FUCKING HOLIDAY AND THIS WAS OUR HOLIDAY 
I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND MY HOLIDAY TIDYING UP THEIR FUCKING MESS 
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT A MEETING ALREADY AND GETTING THEM HOYED OUT 
NEXT TIME ON YOUNG MUM'S MANSION 
IT FELT AS IF YOU LEFT IT TO SAY YOU'VE HAD YOUR HOLIDAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE DIDN'T SO FUCK YOU 
THE SINGLE PARENTS NEEDS TWO LEADERS 
I AM THE LEADER AND NOW I AM IN CONTROL 
AND IT'S MY TURN TO BOSS THEM AROUND 
YOU'RE GOING TO GET PUNISHED IF YOU DON'T PULL YOUR WEIGHT 
I'M NOT A FUCKING CHILD SO I WON'T GET PUNISHED AT ALL YES YOU WILL 
ARE TWO HEADS BETTER THAN ONE 
YOU'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING I WASN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO DO TERRI 
SHE IS A MORON 
WHEN I FEEL HURT I NEED TO REMOVE MYSELF FROM THE SITUATION 
IT'S THE LAST CHANCE FOR THE MUMS TO PROVE COMMUNAL LIVING CAN WORK 
WHEN I GO HOME I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO COPE BECAUSE I'M GOING TO NEED FOUR WEEKS TO RECOVER FROM THIS 
AND HOW LONG WILL TERESINA NEED TO RECOVER FROM A VISIT FROM HER MUM 
DID YOU TALK TO YOUR MOTHER ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL YEAH 
WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT DON'T PLEASE 
RESPECT HOW I FEEL O. K.
