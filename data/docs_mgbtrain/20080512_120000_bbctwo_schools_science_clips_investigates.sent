OOOOOOH 
AAAAAGH 
STATISTICS SUGGEST THAT MANY PUPILS ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
ARRIVE AT SCHOOL WITHOUT EATING ANY BREAKFAST 
DOES THIS REALLY MATTER THE WELSH ASSEMBLY THINKS IT MIGHT 
SO THEY'RE PROPOSING THAT ALL PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPILS IN WALES 
ARE OFFERED A FREE HEALTHY BREAKFAST 
TO HELP THEM MAKE THEIR DECISION THEY'VE ASKED RESEARCHERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CARDIFF 
TO GATHER SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE OF THE LINKS BETWEEN HAVING BREAKFAST AND CONCENTRATION 
A LOT OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT BREAKFAST 
DOES HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON MEMORY AND CONCENTRATION 
SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE MIGHT FIND SIMILAR EFFECTS IN A SCHOOL SETTING WHICH WOULD BE INTERESTING 
BECAUSE IT'D SHOW THAT THIS REALLY DOES WORK IN A REAL LIFE SETTING 
THEY'RE CURRENTLY GATHERING DATA FROM OVER FIVE THOUSAND PUPILS ACROSS THE WHOLE OF WALES 
THE TESTS THAT MEASURE MEMORY AND CONCENTRATION HAVE BEEN USED FOR YEARS IN ALL SORTS OF STUDIES' 
THEY'RE STANDARDISED TESTS 
AND HERE AT SEVERN JUNIOR IN CARDIFF THEY'VE SPLIT UP ONE YEAR FIVE CLASS 
HALF HAVE BEEN GIVEN BREAKFAST THE OTHER HALF HAVEN'T 
THOSE ON THE RIGHT TOOK PART IN THE BREAKFAST CLUB 
WHILST THOSE ON THE LEFT WERE LEFT OUT IN THE COLD 
THEY'RE ALL GOING TO UNDERGO THE SAME CONCENTRATION TESTS 
EACH OF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN ENVELOPES AND INSIDE ARE THREE FORMS WE WANT YOU TO HELP US FILL OUT 
IF EVERYBODY CAN OPEN THEIR ENVELOPES AND TAKE OUT THE WHITE FORM PLEASE O. K. 
THIS IS THE FIRST TASK WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY 
ON THE BOARD YOU'LL SEE A LIST OF TWENTY WORDS 
EACH WORD WILL BE ON THE BOARD FOR TWO SECONDS 
WE WANT YOU TO TRY AND REMEMBER THE WORDS 
ONCE YOU'VE SEEN ALL OF THE WORDS 
TRY TO WRITE DOWN AS MANY OF THEM AS YOU CAN REMEMBER 
IS EVERYBODY STEADY YES GO 
WRITE DOWN AS MANY OF THOSE AS YOU CAN REMEMBER 
THE PUPILS WON'T BE JUDGED ON HOW WELL THEY DO IN FACT IT'S A BLIND TEST 
EACH SET OF TEST PAPERS IS ANONYMOUS SO NO ONE KNOWS WHO THEY BELONG TO 
INSTEAD THEY HAVE A UNIQUE NUMBER 
IN ORDER TO SEE WHETHER BREAKFAST HAS HAS AN EFFECT ON THINGS LIKE MEMORY AND CONCENTRATION 
WE NEED TO DO THE TESTS WITH LOTS OF CHILDREN IF YOU TAKE A SMALL GROUP 
IT MAY BE THAT SOME OF THEM HAPPEN TO BE VERY TIRED ON THE DAY 
OR THEY MAY HAVE REALLY GOOD MEMORIES 
THEY MAY ALL BE IN THE GROUP THAT HAVEN'T HAD BREAKFAST 
IN ORDER TO GET RID OF ALL THAT VARIABILITY WE NEED TO HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT GROUPS' 
O. K. STOP WRITING PUT YOUR PENCILS DOWN O. K. WELL DONE EVERYBODY 
THE NEXT TASK IS SIMILAR TO THE LAST ONE 
AS WELL AS THE TESTS THE PUPILS ARE ALSO ASKED TO FILL OUT A FOOD QUESTIONNAIRE 
TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY'D EATEN DURING THE MORNING 
THEY COULD'VE EATEN THEIR BREAKFAST IN A VARIETY OF PLACES OR EATEN ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL 
THEY MAY HAVE HAD SOMETHING JUST BEFORE CLASSES STARTED 
THE QUESTIONNAIRE REMINDS THEM OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING THAT MORNING 
DID THEY WATCH T. V. 
THIS JOGS THEIR MEMORY SO THEY REMEMBER WHAT THEY ATE 
THE MORE EVERYONE TAKING PART REMEMBERS THE MORE ACCURATE THE RESULTS 
WITH THE TESTS COMPLETE THOSE YEAR FIVE PUPILS CAN RELAX 
BUT THIS IS JUST THE START OF DOCTOR KATY TAPPER AND REBECCA LYNCH'S WORK 
THEY NOW HAVE TO ANALYSE THE RESULTS 
O. K. I'M JUST FINISHING NOW ENTERING ALL THE DATA 
THAT'S HOW THEY BREAK DOWN TABLE WISE 
WE GET A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BREAKFAST AND THE NO BREAKFAST GROUP 
THE BREAKFAST GROUP HAVE DONE BETTER THAN THOSE WITHOUT BREAKFAST 
THAT THIRTEEN WAS IN THE NO BREAKFAST GROUP RIGHT 
THERE ARE SOME CHILDREN WHO'VE JUST GOT BETTER MEMORIES YEAH 
KATY AND REBECCA STILL HAVE MANY MORE SCHOOLS TO VISIT AND BREAKFASTS TO FACE 
BEFORE THEY CAN DRAW ANY FIRM CONCLUSIONS 
BUT IF THEIR RESULTS FOLLOW THIS TREND 
PERHAPS YOU'LL BE STARTING YOUR DAY WITH THE BREAKFAST CLUB 
MMM AAH 
MMM 
WHO IS THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR OF ALL TIME 
OUR CONTESTANTS SPAN FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OF GROUND BREAKING SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY 
BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM CAN BE THE WINNER 
ON TODAY'S SHOW TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU THAT HE'S THE GREATEST 
IS EDWARD JENNER 
HELLO ED I CAN CALL YOU ED 
SO LONG AS YOU DON'T CALL ME BIG EAD MY DEAR I'LL TRY NOT TO 
NOW THEN YOU WERE BORN IN GLOUCESTER IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY NINE WAS THAT A NICE AREA 
LOVELY MY DEAR ALL FIELDS AND COWS 
SHALL I TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT A COW CALLED BLOSSOM NO 
TELL ME WHAT ON EARTH MAKES YOU THINK YOU'RE THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR OF ALL TIME 
SIMPLE BECAUSE OF MY INVESTIGATIONS A TERRIBLE DISEASE CALLED SMALLPOX 
WAS BEATEN UTTERLY AND COMPLETELY GIVE US THE DETAILS THEN 
WELL IT WAS A STORY IN OUR PART OF THE WORLD 
THAT MILKMAIDS WHO HAD A MILD DISEASE CALLED COWPOX COULDN'T CATCH SMALLPOX 
SHALL I TELL MY STORY ABOUT BLOSSOM LATER 
STICK TO THE DETAILS 
I WAS WORKING AS A COUNTRY DOCTOR AND MILKMAIDS WITH COWPOX OFTEN CAME TO SEE ME 
IT GAVE THEM BLISTERS ON THEIR HANDS 
SO I BEGAN TO WONDER IF IN SOME WAY THE PUS IN THEIR BLISTERS NOT THE DETAILS 
THE PUS IS IMPORTANT MY DEAR I BEGAN TO THINK IT MIGHT CONTAIN SOMETHING SPECIAL 
GO ON AND PLEASE DON'T MENTION BLOSSOM 
MY HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT SOMEONE WITH COWPOX WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CATCH SMALLPOX 
SO I DESIGNED A TEST 
WHICH WAS TO GIVE A HEALTHY PERSON A DOSE OF COWPOX 
THEN FOLLOW IT UP WITH A DOSE OF SMALLPOX 
IF THE SMALLPOX FAILED TO DEVELOP MY HYPOTHESIS WAS PROVEN 
IF IT DID DEVELOP YOUR POOR VICTIM WAS DEAD DON'T TELL ME YOU'VE TRIED IT 
THAT'S WHERE BLOSSOM THE COW COMES IN MY DEAR YOU TESTED IT ON AN INNOCENT COW 
I TESTED IT ON AN INNOCENT EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY WHAT 
A MILKMAID WHO CAME TO MY SURGERY HAD CAUGHT COWPOX FROM A COW NAMED BLOSSOM 
SO I TOOK SOME PUS FROM HER BLISTERS AND INJECTED IT INTO A BOY NAMED JAMES PHIPPS 
PERFECTLY SAFE THING TO DO MY DEAR NOBODY HAD EVER DIED OF COWPOX 
AND THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO THE POOR LITTLE MITE 
I DELIBERATELY INJECTED HIM WITH THE FOUL DISEASE OF SMALLPOX 
AND DID HE SUFFER NOT THE SLIGHTEST ILL EFFECTS 
QUITE CORRECT MY HYPOTHESIS WAS PROVEN 
AN INJECTION OF COWPOX COULD PREVENT A PERSON CONTRACTING SMALLPOX 
SO EXPERIMENTING ON CHILDREN 
IS WHY YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE CALLED THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR OF ALL TIME 
NO IT'S BECAUSE THE METHOD WHICH RESULTS IN VACCINATION 
IS THE ONLY METHOD YET DEVISED TO PREVENT AN INFECTION RATHER THAN CURE IT 
SO WILL EDWARD JENNER BE ELECTED GREATEST SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR OF ALL TIME 
OR WILL HE BE MOO VED ASIDE BY ANOTHER 
THE DECISION IS YOURS
