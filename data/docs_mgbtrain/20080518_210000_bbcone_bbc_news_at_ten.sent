PREDICTED THERE WILL BE A DRAMATIC 
INCREASE OF AID REACHING THE 
DESPERATE SURVIVORS OF BURMA'S 
CYCLONE HE SAID THE MILITARY 
REGIME HAD AGREED A STRATEGY TO LET 
IN MORE INTERNATIONAL RELIEF 
ALTHOUGH HE BELIEVED THERE WAS A 
LONG WAY TO GO HIS VISIT COMES AS 
POWERFUL EVIDENCE RECORDED BY A 
BRITISH MEDICAL TEAM SHOWS THE 
EXTENT OF SUFFERING INSIDE BURMA 
THE AID AGENCY MERLIN TRAVELLED TO 
LAPUTTA IN THE WORST HIT AREA OF 
THE IRRAWADDY DELTA AND FILMED WHAT 
THEY FOUND THERE 
A UNIQUE GLIMPSE INTO BURMA'S 
MISERY MISERY THIS IS THE MONG FAMILY MAROONED 
IN A SEA OF MUD THEY LOST THIRTEEN

POSSIBLE BUT RECOGNISE IT IS LESS 
THAN WITH WE WANT AND SEE WHAT 
NEGOTIATIONS IN THE COMING DAYS BY 
THE ASIAN LEADERS BY THE UN 
SECRETARY GENERAL ACHIEVES I 
THINK YOU WILL SEE QUITE DRAMATIC 
STEPS BY THE BURMESE TO OPEN UP 
IN THE DELTA AID FROM BRITAIN GETS 
THROUGH TO THE MERLIN DOCTORS 
A CHILD CRIES OUT AS HIS INFECTED 
WOUND IS FINALLY TREATED 
THIS IS A VERY COMMON THING WE SEE 
AFTER EMERGENCIES THAT WOUNDS ARE 
TREATED BUT THEY ARE NOT PROPERLY 
DISINFECTED AND STERILISED WHEN 
THAT HAPPENS IT IS ALMOST CERTAINTY 
THAT THE WOUND WILL BREAK DOWN AND 
NOT HEAL PROPERLY 
SLOWLY MORE 
PEOPLE ARE GETTING OUTSIDE HELP 
HERE BUT ALL THIS SHOULD HAVE 
HAPPENED TWO WEEKS AGO AT EVERY 
EXTRA DAY IS COSTING LIVES 
CHINA HAS DECLARED THREE DAYS OF 
MOURNING FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE 
SICHUAN EARTHQUAKE RESCUE WORK 
CONTINUES BUT VERY FEW VICTIMS ARE 
BEING FOUND ALIVE 
YOU MAY FIND PARTS OF THIS REPORT 
DISTURBING DISTURBING IF THERE IS ANYONE LEFT ALIVE UNDER 
THE RUINS UNDER THE TOWN OF 
BEICHUAN NO ONE CAN FIND THEM 
AFTER SIX DAYS YOU DON'T GET TOO 
MANY MORE MIRACLES 
HERE RESCUERS BREAKTHROUGH THE 
RUBBLE OF A HOTEL THIS MAN IS 
HOPING TO FIND HIS THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD SON 
HE HAS ASKED RESCUERS TO SEARCH 
BECAUSE HE'S CONVINCED HIS SON IS 
STILL ALIVE 
THE DAY 
BEFORE YESTERDAY HE CALLED MY SON'S 
MOBILE PHONE AND WE GOT THROUGH 
BUT WE COULD ONLY HEAR BREATHING 
VERY WEAK BREATHING 
THE WORKERS LOOK INSIDE BUT THEY 
DON'T FIND ANY SURVIVORS 
RESCUE WORKERS HAVE GIVEN UP HOPE 
HERE THEY HAVE GOT TO MOVE ON TO 
OTHER PLACES BUT WHEN YOUR ONLY 
SON IS TRAPPED UNDERNEATH ALL THIS 
AND YOU BELIEVE THAT HE'S STILL 
ALIVE YOU CAN'T WALK AWAY 
HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE THAT THEY 
SHOULD GIVE UP LOOKING FOR ALL THAT 
THEY HAVE 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE 
DIED AND WE'RE NOW SLOWLY LEARNING 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO SOME OF THEM 
THESE PICTURES FILMED IN BEICHUAN 
ON FRIDAY SHOW A MAN TRAPPED UNDER 
A COLLAPSED BUILDING 
HE'S SERIOUSLY INJURED THE T. V. 
REPORTER HANDS HIM A MOBILE PHONE 
SO THAT HE CAN TALK TO HIS WIFE 
HE DOESN'T HOLD OUT MUCH HOPE OF 
SURVIVING HE TELLS HER 
LATER ON RESCUERS MANAGED TO PULL 
HIM OUT BUT THEY ARE TOO LATE 
THEY CAN'T REVIVE HIM 
THESE PICTURES SHOW THAT THERE'S 
NOT MUCH HOPE IN OTHER PLACES 
EITHER EITHER THESE ARE THE FIRST SHOTS OF A 
REMOTE VILLAGE ENTIRELY DESTROYED 
BY THE EARTHQUAKE 
YOU CAN BARELY TELL THAT IT EVER 
EXISTED EXISTED THOSE WHO MADE IT OUT ALIVE DON'T 
KNOW WHAT TO DO 
IT HAS EMERGED THAT THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST 
DEFENCE COMPANY B. A. E. SYSTEMS AND A 
SENIOR COLLEAGUE WERE DETAINED AND 
QUESTIONED AT AN AMERICAN AIRPORT 
LAST WEEK THE AMERICANS ARE 
INVESTIGATING A MAJOR ARMS DEAL 
WITH SAUDI ARABIA IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND 
CORRUPTION IN THAT DEAL 
AN IMMENSELY EMBARRASSING ENCOUNTER 
FOR THE HEAD OF ONE OF BRITAIN'S 
BIGGEST COMPANIES THE DEFENCE 
EQUIPMEN MANUFACTURER B. A. E. SYSTEM 
ENTERING THE U. S. AT ONE OF THE 
COUNTRY'S BUSIEST AIRPORTS BAE'S 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE MIKE TURNER AND 
COMPANION WERE UNEXPECTEDLY 
DETAINED THEY WERE QUESTIONED FOR 
TWENTY MINUTES AND THEIR LAPTOPS 
SEARCHED BEFORE BEING ALLOWED TO GO 
IT IS ALL PART OF THE U. S. JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT'S INVESTIGATION INTO A 
MASSIVE ARMS DEAL SUPPLYING JETS 
AND TRAINING EQUIPMENT TO SAUDI 
ARABIA AND WHETHER BRIBERY WAS 
INVOLVED IT IS AN ALLEGATION B. A. E. 
DENIES BUT IT HAS CAUSED 
POLITICAL STORM IN BRITAIN THE 
ORIGINAL ARMS DEAL SIGNED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
CEMENTED BRITAIN'S BIGGEST EVER 
EXPORT DEAL PROBE WAS LAUNCHED A 
FEW YEARS AGO BY BRITAIN'S SERIOUS 
FRAUD OFFICE THE ALLEGATION WAS 
PRINCE BANDAR HAD RECEIVED MILLIONS 
IN KICKBACKS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE SAUDIS 
ISSUED A THREAT THAT THEY MIGHT 
STOP CO OPERATION ON INTELLIGENCE 
AND FUTURE ARMS SALES TONY BLAIR 
ORDERED AN ABRUPT HALT TO THE PROBE 
THAT IS BEING CHALLENGED BY THE 
HIGH COURT WHO RULED THAT THE 
SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE WAS WRONG TO 
HALT THE INVESTIGATION ACROSS THE 
ATLANTIC R. T. PARALLEL U. S. 
INVESTIGATION IS CLEARLY REACHING 
AN ACTIVE STAGE BAE'S CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE WAS ISSUED WITH 
SUBPOENA COURT DEMAND FOR 
INFORMATION SIGN SAY CRITICS 
THAT THE U. S. WILL GO WHERE THE 
BRITISH GOVERNMENT FEARS TO TREAD 
IT IS NATIONAL DISGRACE THAT IN 
THIS COUNTRY A MAJOR CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION WAS STOPPED FOLLOWING 
POLITICAL INTERFERENCE IN ORDER TO 
PROTECT COMMERCIAL INTERESTS WHERE 
AS IN THE UNITED STATES THEY 
PROSECUTE D. THE PROSECUTORS ARE 
ALLOWED TO GET ON WITH THEIR JOBS 
B. A. E. SYSTEMS SAYS THEY ARE CO 
OPERATING 
THE FOREIGN OFFICE INSISTS ANY 
DEALINGS BETWEEN THE U. S. JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT AND B. A. E. SYSTEMS 
CONCERNS THEM ALONE BUT THE 
AMERICANS HAVE ALSO APPROACHED THE 
HOME OFFICE APPARENTLY FORMALLY 
QUESTIONED LEGAL ASSISTANCE SO 
CONTROVERSY OVER THE SAUDI ARMS 
DEAL ISN'T OVER YET 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS CALLED ON 
M. P.'S TO BACK STEM CELL RESEARCH 
USING HUMAN ANIMAL EMBRYOS GORDON 
BROWN SAID SUCH WORK WAS A MORAL 
ENDEAVOUR AND HAD THE POTENTIAL TO 
SAVE MILLIONS OF LIVES HOWEVER 
POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS OPPONENTS 
OF THE BILL DUE TO 
BE DEBATED 
BY 
M. P.'S TOMORROW SAY IT IS MORALLY 
WRONG TO COMBINE HUMAN AND ANIMAL 
GENETICS GENETICS M. P.'S GET A CHANCE TO SET ASIDE PARTY 
POLITICS AND THROUGH PERSONAL 
CONSCIENCE DECIDE ISSUES OF 
FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO SCIENCE 
AND SOCIETY THEY WILL GET FOUR 
FREE VOTES TOMORROW ON HYBRID 
EMBRYOS AND SO CALLED SAVIOUR 
SIBLINGS AND ON TUESDAY ON THE 
STATUS OF FATHERS IN I. V. F. AND THE 
TIME LIT IT FOR ABORTION 
BRITISH SCIENTISTS HAVE ALREADY 
CREATED HYBRIDS CREATING CATTLE 
EGGS BECAUSE HUMAN EGGS ARE IN 
SHORT SUPPLY THEY ARE NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE PER CENT HUMAN 
AND OH ONE PER CENT ANIMAL THEY HOPE TO 
EXTRACT THE STEM CELLS INSIDE WHEN 
THEY ARE SMALLER THAN A PIN HEAD 
IN ORDER TO STUDY A RANGE OF 
DISEASES IN HIS OBSERVER ARTICLE 
GORDON BROWN GIVES UNEQUIVOCAL 
REPORT SUPPORT 
BUT THOSE AGAINST HYBRID EMBRYOS 
WILL ARGUE THAT EMBRYONIC STEM CELL 
RESEARCH HAS SO FAR YIELDED NOTHING 
THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ROUTE BUT 
BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY ROUTE WHICH 
THROWS UP MORAL PROBLEMS ADD DUMB 
STEM CELLS DON'T UMBILICAL CHORD 
USE DOESN'T BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY 
ROUTE THROWING UP MORAL PROBLEMS 
IT SEEMS TO ME THE ONUS 
IS ON 
SCIENCE TO 
SAY LOOK WE CAN PROVE 
THIS WORKS SO FAR IT HASN'T 
TOMORROW MR. BROWN WILL ALSO VOTE IN 
SUPPORT OF THE CREATION OF SAVIOUR 
SIBLINGS THAT ALLOWS COUPLES TO 
CONCEIVE A CHILD TO DONATE 
UMBILICAL CHORD BLOOD FOR A 
SIBLINGS ON TUESDAY IT IS THE ROLE 
OF FATHERS IN I. V. F. AND ABORTION MR. 
BROWN SAYS HE WILL VOTE TO KEEP THE 
ABORTION LIMIT AT TWENTY FOUR WEEKS 
THE CLEAR ADVICE FROM NOBLE PRIZE 
WINNING SCIENTISTS AND CANCER 
RESEARCH U. K. AND PARKINS SON'S 
DISEASE SOCIETIES SAY THIS RESEARCH 
IS VITAL IT MAY MAKE SOME FEEL 
DISTINCTIVELY UNCOMFORTABLE BEFORE 
THEY OVERRULE BRITISH SCIENCE 
OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IS AT 
WESTMINSTER THIS IS A PRETTY 
SIGNIFICANT DEBATE WHAT DO WE THINK 
WILL HAPPEN 
YES THE VOTES CAST BY 
M. P.'S HERE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS WILL HAVE FAR REACHING 
CONSEQUENCES THE SCIENTIFIC 
RESEARCH AND FOR FAMILIES RIGHT 
ACROSS THE LAND MANY M. P.'S FEEL VERY 
PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE ISSUE 
INVOLVED THAT IS WHY GORDON BROWN 
HAD TO CAVE IN AND ALLOW FREE VOTES 
ON SOME OF THE MORE CONTENTIOUS 
ELEMENTS SOME MEMBERS OF HIS OWN 
CABINET FELT SO STRONGLY THAT THEY 
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT 
THE GOVERNMENT LINE GORDON BROWN 
HAS LAUNCHED A PERSONAL CASE FOR 
ALLOWING RESEARCH ON HYBRID EMBRYOS 
HE IS LIKELY TO GET BACKING ON THAT 
THERE IS A LOT OF SUPPORT BUILDING 
FOR A REDUCTION IN ABORTIONS DOWN 
TO TWENTY WEEKS 
IT HAS BEEN A WEEKEND TO REMEMBER 
FOR PORTSMOUTH FOOTBALL CLUB AS 
THE TEAM CELEBRATED YESTERDAY'S F. A. 
CUP FINAL VICTORY AGAINST CARDIFF 
CITY AARON REDMOND AND HIS SIDE 
WERE CHEERED ON HARRY REDKNAPP 
WERE CHEERED ON BY AN ESTIMATED 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FANS ON AN OPEN TOPPED BUS 
PORTSMOUTH IS USED TO CELEBRATING 
NAVAL HEROS BUT TODAY WAS ABOUT 
VICTORY OF A DIFFERENT KIND 
IT FELT LIKE THE ENTIRE CITY HAD 
TURNED OUT SOUTH SEA COMMON BLUER 
THAN THE SKY BUT WHEN YOU HAVE 
WAITED SIXTY NINE YEARS YOU DON'T WANT TO 
MISS THE PARTY 
WE GREW UP WISHING 
AND DREAMING FOR THIS DAY TO HAPPEN 
HOW PROUD DO YOU FEEL TODAY A A THOUSAND TIMES A MILLION A TRILLION 
I DRANK MYSELF SILLY LAST NIGHT AND 
DIDN'T HAVE A HEADACHE THIS MORNING 
I FEEL BRILLIANT FOR EVERYBODY AND 
GOOD OLD HARRY 
HARRY THEY ARE 
GOOD OLD HARRY CALLING HIM RIDING HIS DOUBLE 
DECKER CHARIOT ALONG THE SEAFRONT 
WITH SO MANY LOYAL SUBJECTS IN THE 
WAY THE BUS HAD TO STOP

THESE PEOPLE 
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN 
THIS HAPPY BEFORE NO NO A CHANCE FROM THE MAN WHO SCORED 
THE VITAL GOAL AFTER WINNING THE 
CUP THE TEAM IS EXPECTED TO WIN 
FREE DOM OF THIS CITY IT IS NOT 
JUST THE F. A. CUP WIN THEY ARE 
CELEBRATING IT

GIVE THEM 
THE CHANCE TO PLAY 
IN EUROPE 
NEXT SEASON FOR 
FIRST TIME IN THIS CLUB'S HISTORY 
NINETEEN YEARS AFTER HIS LAST SCREEN 
OUTING INDIANA JONES IS BACK THIS 
TIME PITTING HIS WITS AGAINST 
SOVIET AGENTS IN THE JUNGLES PERU 
THE FILM WAS PREMIERED AT THE 
CANNES FILM FESTIVAL 
AT THE WORLD'S FOREMOST ART HOUSE 
FESTIVAL MOVIE THAT HAS 
BLOCKBUSTER WRITTEN ALL OVER IT 
HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST TALKING POINT 
INDIANA JONES IS BACK IN AN ASIDE 
THERE IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF HOW 
MUCH TIME HAS PAST 
THIS AIN'T 
GOING TO BE EASY 
NOT AS EASY AS IT 
USED TO BE 
HARRISON FORD IS SIXTY FIVE 
YEARS OLD MANY HAVE QUESTIONED HOW 
CREDIBLE AN ACTION HERO HE CAN BE 
TO A YOUNGER AUDIENCE IS IT 
RELEVANT AS AN ISSUE 
NOT TO ME 
YOU KNOW L. DO WHAT'S REQUIRED IN A CHARACTER 
AND IN TERMS OF THE PLOT CHARACTER MUCH HAS BEEN KEPT SECRET BUT 
HARRISON FORD ALTHOUGH CAREFULLY 
REVEALED A LITTLE 
I WAS PLEASED 
THAT WE MADE THE DECISION TO MOVE 
FORWARD IN TIME AND TO VISIT A 
LATER PERIOD IN HISTORY WHICH IS 
THE PERIOD OF THE COLD WAR NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
AND THE ERA OF MCCARTHYISM IN THE 
UNITED STATES A PERIOD OF TIME IN 
OUR HISTORY WHICH I THINK IS 
SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF 
THIS IS SLICK FORMULA FILM MAKING 
AND WHILE THE STORY IS ALWAYS A 
QUEST THE FRANCHISE CAN PREDICT 
THE ANSWER A BOOMING BOX OFFICE 
FOR ALL THE HIGH MINDED AND ART 
HOUSE SENSABILITIES OF THIS 
FESTIVAL THE PRESENCE OF THE 
FOURTH INDIANA JONES FILM HERE HAS 
CREATED GREAT EXCITEMENT NOT JUST 
AMONGST THE FANS BUT THE CRITICS 
WHENEVER CANNES MEETS HOLLYWOOD 
THEY DO GET ON VERY WELL TOGETHER

MALLOCH BROWN HAS PREDICTED THERE
