WHAT I'M DESPERATE TO TRY AND DO IS TO TRY AND HELP PEOPLE 
TO COOK MORE QUICKLY BUT STILL EAT REALLY REALLY WELL 
THERE ARE FOOD SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD DOING SOME OF THE PREPARATION 
SO THAT WHEN YOU GET HOME FROM WORK AND YOU'VE GOT TO GET A MEAL ON THE TABLE 
SOMEONE ELSE HAS DONE SOME OF THE PREPARATION FOR YOU 
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WHOLE PROJECT IS ABOUT 
THE COMPLEXITY OF SOME ASIAN COOKING HAS ALWAYS BEEN QUITE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE AT HOME 
AND WHAT MAKES IT SO HARD IS THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS 
WHAT'S THE LARGEST NUMBER OF SPICES YOU COULD USE IN ONE CURRY 
IT IS A LAMB SHAKUTI 
IT IS A GOANESE DISH 
TWENTY FOUR DIFFERENT SPICES 
TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR DIFFERENT SPICES 
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY'RE ROASTED YES 
WHEN YOU ROAST THEM AND BLEND THEM THE FLAVOUR IS REALLY GOOD 
HAVE YOU GOT THE TIME TO SHOP 
AND EVEN THEN CAN YOU FIND THEM ALL 
BUT HAPPILY THINGS HAVE NOW CHANGED 
SOMEONE ELSE HAS DONE ALL THE HARD BIT SO WE CAN LITERALLY COOK 
OUR WAY AROUND THE WORLD ANY NIGHT OF THE WEEK 
LET'S BEGIN WITH A CURRY 
THE RECIPE I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS CALLED SPICED CHICKEN MASALA 
AND WE'VE GOT THE CHICKEN HERE WHICH IS TWO CHICKEN BREASTS 
AND THE CHICKEN BREASTS HAVE BEEN JUST CUT INTO BIG CHUNKS 
AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS FIRST OF ALL BROWN THEM IN MY PAN 
I'VE TURNED THE HEAT UP AND I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF GROUNDNUT OIL IN THERE 
PUT THE PIECES OF CHICKEN INTO THE HOT FAT 
I'VE GOT SKIN ON THE CHICKEN HERE 
BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS A BETTER FLAVOUR IF IT'S GOT SKIN 
AND YOU CAN IF YOU WANT TO NOT USE THE BREAST 
YOU CAN USE THIGHS YOU NEED TO GIVE IT A BIT LONGER COOKING 
I'VE USED THE BREAST HERE BECAUSE IT'S QUICKER 
AND I'M IMAGINING THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO MAKE 
WHEN YOU RUSH HOME FROM WORK IN THE EVENING 
WHAT YOU MUSTN'T DO IS PUT ALL THE PIECES OF CHICKEN INTO THE PAN TOGETHER 
IF YOU PUT THEM ALL IN TOGETHER THE STEAM COMES RUSHING OUT AND THEY DON'T BROWN PROPERLY 
THERE WE GO WHAT I'M GOING TO NOW DO IS REMOVE THE OTHER PIECES AND TURN THE HEAT RIGHT DOWN 
TO LOW AND JUST PUT ANOTHER LITTLE SPLASH OF OIL IN THERE 
BECAUSE WE'RE COMING BACK TO THE PAN IN A MINUTE 
BUT FIRST WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A PASTE 
I'VE GOT TWO FAT CLOVES OF GARLIC AND THEN I'M GOING TO USE THIS GINGER 
IT'S VERY NICE TO JUST GET A TEASPOONFUL OUT WITHOUT HAVING ALL THE PALAVER 
OF BUYING A PIECE OF GINGER USING A PIECE AND THEN THROWING THE REST AWAY LATER 
PUT IN HERE A SORT OF HEAPED TEASPOON 
YOU CAN EITHER PUT A MEDIUM ONION IN WITH THOSE TWO INGREDIENTS 
OR YOU CAN USE THIS 
IT'S FROZEN CHOPPED ONION FOUR HEAPED TABLESPOONS 
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO GIVE THAT A LITTLE WHIZZ TO MAKE A PASTE 
AND THIS IS GOING TO GO INTO THE FRYING PAN 
MY FRIEND BRIDGET WHO HELPED ME WITH THE RESEARCH OF INGREDIENTS 
SAYS SHE ALWAYS USES FROZEN ONIONS WHEN SHE DOESN'T WANT HER MASCARA TO RUN 
SO THERE'S A LITTLE TIP 
NOW INSTEAD OF GOING OUT AND BUYING ALL THOSE JARS OF SPICES 
AND FINDING IT'S GONE STALE A YEAR LATER AND PAST THEIR SELL BY DATE YOU CAN BUY THEM READY BLENDED 
I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS BECAUSE YOU OPEN IT LIKE THAT 
YOU USE THE AMOUNT YOU WANT AND THEN YOU CAN SQUEEZE IT BACK AGAIN 
AND KEEP IT FOR NEXT TIME WHICH IS WONDERFUL 
THIS IS CALLED TANDOORI MASALA 
I'M GOING TO USE FOUR TEASPOONS 
WHAT I'VE GOT IN HERE IS CINNAMON TURMERIC GINGER 
CORIANDER SEED CUMIN SEED CLOVES CAYENNE AND PASTE 
SO WE'VE GOT ALL THOSE ROASTED AND GRINDED FOR US 
AND I KNOW THAT YOU CAN BUY JARS OF COOKING CURRY SAUCE BUT IT ISN'T ANYTHING LIKE THIS 
NOTHING LIKE THIS SO NOW WE'VE GOT LOTS OF LOVELY FLAVOURS 
THIS IS ACTUALLY HALF FAT CREME FRAICHE 
IT MAKES A REALLY CREAMY CURRY 
STIR IT IN SO WE'VE GOT A NICE CREAMY RICH CURRY SAUCE 
RETURN THE PIECES OF CHICKEN AND THERE YOU GO 
AND THEN WE'LL JUST BRING IT UP TO A GENTLE SIMMER 
FOR TEN MINUTES 
WERE YOU INTERESTED IN COOKING BEFORE YOU MET DELIA 
I CAN'T SAY I WAS 
IT WAS SUCH A LONG TIME AGO I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I WAS LIKE 
BUT I LOVE IT NOW ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT 
IS DELIA QUITE SHARP IF YOU MISS AN INGREDIENT OUT CAN SHE SPOT IT 
OH YEAH IF IT'S MISSING 
IF YOU USE A DIFFERENT ONE SHE CAN 
IT'S VERY DISTURBING THAT 
SO WHAT'S MICHAEL'S ROLE WITHIN THE KITCHEN FOR YOU HEAD CHEF 
SOUS CHEF HE'S HEAD CHEF 
I'M HUNGRY ALREADY 
WHILE THE SPICED CHICKEN MASALA IS BUBBLING AWAY 
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO SERVE WITH IT 
THIS IS CALLED COCONUT SAMBAL 
AND IT WAS A RECIPE THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND 
WHO LIVED FOR A WHILE IN SRI LANKA AND IT INVOLVES FRESH COCONUT 
MIKE AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT BUT WE USED TO HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY A COCONUT 
PUT IT IN A POLYTHENE BAG AND GIVE IT A WHACK WITH A HAMMER 
TO CRACK IT OPEN AND THEN GET ALL THE COCONUT OUT 
BUT NOW GLORY OF GLORIES SOMEBODY HAS PRODUCED FRESH COCONUT WHICH YOU CAN NOW BUY IN PACKS 
AND IT REALLY IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN ANYTHING DESICCATED OR ANY OTHER KINDS OF COCONUT 
I'VE GOT HALF A SMALL ONION HERE SO THAT'S GOING TO GO IN AND THEN FIFTY GRAMS OF THE COCONUT 
I'M LEAVING THE BROWN SKIN ON BECAUSE THE FIRST TIME I DID THIS 
I TRIED IT WITH THE BROWN SKIN ON AND IT WAS QUITE GOOD IF YOU WANT TO TAKE IT OFF YOU CAN 
NEXT INGREDIENT'S GOING TO BE A SMALL PIECE OF JALAPENO PEPPER 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO USE MORE AND MAKE IT A BIT HOTTER YOU CAN 
I'VE GOT THE JUICE OF HALF A LIME AND THEN JUST A BIT OF SALT 
I'M GOING TO PUT IT INTO A BOWL 
THE CURRY IS FOR TWO THIS IS ENOUGH FOR TWO 
AND JUST PUT A TINY BIT OF CAYENNE PEPPER ON THE TOP 
ALL THOSE LOVELY APPETISING AROMAS OF SPICES MAKE YOU FEEL REALLY HUNGRY 
WE'RE JUST GOING TO PUT SOME RICE ON THE PLATE THIS IS BASMATI RICE 
AND IF YOU'RE A VERY BUSY PERSON YOU CAN BUY BASMATI RICE FROZEN 
WHICH IS MORE OR LESS READY TO SERVE 
HERE WE HAVE OUR CURRY WITH ITS BEAUTIFUL SAUCE 
THEN WE'LL JUST PUT A SPRIG OF CORIANDER TO GIVE IT A BIT OF COLOUR 
AND THEN WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS TAKE SOME SAMBAL AND JUST SPRINKLE IT OVER THE CURRY 
SO THERE WE HAVE IT 
SPICED CHICKEN MASALA WITH COCONUT SAMBAL 
YOU CAN SEE HOW EASY IT IS BUT THE CLEVER THING 
IS HAVING SOMEBODY TO ROAST AND GRIND ALL THOSE SPICES FOR YOU 
GETTING A TASTE OF THE ORIENT ISN'T JUST ABOUT COMBINATIONS OF SPICES 
IT'S ABOUT THE SKILL OF ROASTING GRINDING AND THEN BLENDING THEM 
I DECIDED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME AWARD WINNING SPECIALISTS 
THIS IS WHERE IT ALL HAPPENS RIGHT 
IN THE PRODUCTION 
IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES YOU COULD BE IN A MIDDLE EASTERN SOUK 
THIS IS THE BLENDING ROOM AND THIS IS DAVE OUR MASTER SPICE ROASTER 
MASTER SPICE ROASTER 
WHICH SPICE IS IN THERE NOW WE'VE GOT CLOVES PEPPERCORNS BLACK 
CORIANDER NIGELLA 
YOU'VE GOT ALL THAT IN THERE AND THEY'RE BEING ROASTED TOGETHER 
THAT'S RIGHT YES SO THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY PART OF THE SPECIAL BLEND 
THE REASON WE'RE ROASTING THESE SPICES IS IT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO THE FLAVOUR 
IT'S REALLY INTENSIFYING THOSE FLAVOURS 
OH MY GOODNESS 
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SMELL IT OH YOU MIGHT FIND IT'S A BIT OVERPOWERING 
EXCUSE ME BLESS YOU 
I'M SO SORRY I TRIED SO HARD 
THIS IS ALL THE BLENDS HERE THAT DAVE IN THERE HAS ROASTED 
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO REPLICATE HOW THESE ARE MADE IN THE KITCHENS IN THOSE PARTICULAR CUISINES 
TRADITIONALLY IT'S USED IN FISH BASED CURRIES IN THE CARIBBEAN 
IT'S GOT A LOT OF CORIANDER AND FENUGREEK IN IT WHICH GIVES A NICE CITRUS EDGE TO IT 
YES IT DOES 
DO YOU DO A LOT OF COOKING UM 
I DO DO A FAIR BIT OF COOKING YEAH 
I BET IT'S GOOD EATING ROUND YOUR PLACE 
WELL I DO MY BEST 
I HAVE MY ODD DISASTER SO DO WE ALL 
SOMETIMES IT WORKS OUT WELL 
I WOULD REALLY MUCH RATHER YOU ROASTED THEM AND BLENDED THEM 
THAN ME GOING ROUND THE SHOPS TRYING TO FIND THIS ONE AND THAT ONE 
THE SPICE BLENDS ARE OUTSTANDING 
BUT EQUALLY BRILLIANT ARE THESE FRESH INGREDIENTS FROM THAILAND WHICH COME IN A FROZEN PACK 
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A REAL STUNNER 
IT'S CALLED THAI GREEN PRAWN CURRY 
ALL THE INGREDIENTS COME READY PREPARED IN A FROZEN PACK 
FIRST OF ALL I'VE GOT GARLIC PREPARED I'VE GOT THAI SHALLOTS 
SPECIAL SHALLOTS I'VE GOT FRESH GINGER I'VE GOT LEMONGRASS 
AND I'VE GOT MILD GREEN CHILLIES 
IN HERE I'VE GOT CHOPPED THAI BASIL 
WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ITALIAN BASIL AND CHOPPED CORIANDER 
AND HERE I'VE GOT SOME SPICES I'VE GOT PAPRIKA AND CUMIN 
YOU GIVE THEM ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES TO JUST BEGIN TO DEFROST 
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY DEFROSTED 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM AS THEY DO IN THAILAND TRADITIONALLY INTO A PASTE 
SO I'M GOING TO PUT THEM INTO MY CHOPPER LIKE THAT 
ALTHOUGH YOU'RE SPENDING A BIT OF TIME ON THIS 
IT'S O. K. BECAUSE JUST THINK OF THE TIME YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO SPEND PREPARING THAT LOT THERE WE GO 
AUTHENTIC THAI PASTE MADE WITH AUTHENTIC INGREDIENTS 
WHAT I'VE GOT HERE HEATING IS JUST ONE DESSERTSPOON OF GROUNDNUT OIL 
THEN YOU PUT THE PASTE INTO THE PAN 
AND THEN GIVE IT A GOOD STIR 
AND WHAT THEY SAY IN THAILAND THEY SAY STIR IT UNTIL IT BECOMES FRAGRANT 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING YOU'VE NOW GOT THIS WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE 
BEGINNING TO PERMEATE THE KITCHEN IT'S REALLY LOVELY 
I'LL PUT THE HEAT DOWN NOW 
THESE ARE TIGER PRAWNS 
KING PRAWNS AND THEY'RE UNCOOKED 
AND THEY'RE JUST GOING TO GO IN NOW WITH THE CURRY PASTE 
THE ONLY THING YOU'VE GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL ABOUT 
WHEN YOU'RE COOKING FROM FROZEN IS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE COOKED PROPERLY 
SO YOU LOOK AT EACH PRAWN AND MAKE SURE IT'S PINK BOTH SIDES BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE VERY LONG 
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD SOME OTHER LUSCIOUS INGREDIENTS 
FIRST OF ALL THAI FISH SAUCE 
ONE TWO THREE 
ONE TEASPOON OF SHRIMP PASTE 
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER INGREDIENT WHICH IS NATURAL PALM SUGAR SOMETIMES CALLED JAGGERY 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THAT YOU CAN JUST USE ORDINARY BROWN SUGAR 
WE'LL JUST GIVE THAT A STIR 
THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE COCONUT MILK LIGHT COCONUT MILK 
I'M PUTTING IN THREE CANS 
AND THAT'S GOING TO SIMMER NOW WITHOUT A LID FOR FIVE MINUTES 
IN THAILAND THEY HAVE KAFFIR LIMES 
THEY'RE NOT LIKE THE LIMES WE KNOW THEY'VE GOT VERY ROUGH SKIN 
THESE ARE PART OF THE KIT BUT I'VE KEPT THEM BACK TILL LAST 
JUST ROLL THEM UP INTO A LITTLE ROLL LIKE THAT 
AND THEN JUST CUT THEM WITH MY KNIFE INTO LITTLE SHREDS 
AND THESE ARE GOING TO GO IN WITH THE REST JUST WONDERFUL 
THE AROMA AND FRAGRANCE OF THESE IS JUST INCREDIBLE SO IN THEY GO NOW 
THAT'S GOING TO HAVE JUST ANOTHER COUPLE OF MINUTES 
WHAT YOU NEED TO HAVE WITH THIS WONDERFUL SAUCE 
IS LOTS OF THAI JASMINE RICE WHICH IS THE PERFECT PARTNER 
IF YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF COOKED CHICKEN BREASTS OR LEFTOVER CHICKEN 
IT'S JUST AS NICE WITH THAT AS WELL AS WITH PRAWNS 
AN ABSOLUTELY AUTHENTIC THAI GREEN CURRY FROM A KIT 
AND YOU STILL HAVE THE FUN OF MAKING IT 
CHEATS SEARCHING FOR INGREDIENTS NEED TO KEEP IN TOUCH 
WITH LOCAL FARM SHOPS AND DELIS 
I'M REALLY PLEASED THAT DANDA THE DAUGHTER OF A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE 
HAS ASKED ME TO OPEN HER NEW DELI 
HER FATHER WAS THE LATE JOHN PEEL MUCH LOVED AND LAMENTED 
AND HIS WIFE SHEILA HAS CONTINUED TO BE A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE 
DANDA IS THEIR ELDEST DAUGHTER 
YOU KNOW WHAT DANDA DID WITH THE RIBBON DON'T YOU 
RIGHT SHE'S GOT GREEN AND YELLOW FOR NORWICH 
SHE'S GOT BLUE FOR IPSWICH 
ABSOLUTELY AND RED FOR LIVERPOOL 
ISN'T SHE WONDERFUL VERY DIPLOMATIC 
HE LIVES OVER THE FIELDS FROM ME SO 
AND IT WAS REALLY LOVELY BECAUSE WHEN I USED TO LISTEN TO JOHN ON THE RADIO 
HE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT STOWMARKET 
AND THAT NOBODY ON EARTH KNOWS WHERE STOWMARKET IS NO 
THIS DELI IS NOW OFFICIALLY OPEN 
THERE IS THIS PERSONAL SERVICE 
IF I COULD SAY THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH MODERN LIFE 
WE'VE LOST SERVICE 
I DON'T WANT TO FILL UP MY CAR WITH PETROL MYSELF I WANT SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO IT FOR ME 
AND WHEN YOU GO IN A SHOP YOU KNOW HOW YOU WANDER DOWN SUPERMARKETS AND YOU'RE LOOKING 
YOU COME INTO A SHOP IT'S HAVE YOU GOT THIS YES OR NO 
I THINK IT'S SAD THAT WE'VE LOST SERVICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I WOULD CHECK THAT VERY CAREFULLY 
ASIAN INGREDIENTS CAN TRANSFORM SOMETHING QUITE SIMPLE 
INTO SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL IN ABSOLUTELY NO TIME AT ALL 
WHAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS SOMETHING YOU COULD SERVE AS A FIRST COURSE 
OR WITH DRINKS AND THIS IS CALLED VIETNAMESE SPRING ROLLS 
YOU START OFF WITH THESE WHICH IS A PACK OF SPRING ROLL WRAPPERS 
THERE'S GOING TO BE NO COOKING INVOLVED IN THIS AT ALL 
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE THEM ALL YOU HAVE TO RESEAL IT AGAIN 
BECAUSE THEY GO FUNNY IF YOU LEAVE THEM OUT OF THE PACK 
THEY'RE MADE FROM RICE PAPER SO THEY'RE QUITE RIGID 
BEFORE YOU CAN USE THAT YOU HAVE TO SOAK IT IN WARM WATER 
JUST COUNT UP TO ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS 
AND THE WAY TO TELL WHETHER IT'S READY TO USE OR NOT 
IS YOU LIFT IT OUT OF THE WATER AND IF YOU CAN STILL HEAR IT 
YOU PUT IT BACK IN AGAIN 
IT BEGINS TO GIVE UNDER YOUR FINGERS AS WELL YOU CAN FEEL IT GIVE 
YES NOT SO MUCH NOISE NOW SO THAT'LL BE FINE TO USE 
THEN YOU PUT IT ONTO A CLOTH SMOOTH IT OUT LIKE THAT 
DRY IT ON ONE SIDE AND DRY IT ON THE OTHER SIDE 
TAKE SOME READY COOKED PRAWNS FROM A PACK 
TAKE A SHARP KNIFE PRESS HARD 
AND BE CAREFUL AND THEN YOU JUST GO THROUGH IT LIKE THAT SO YOU'VE GOT IT CUT IN HALF 
YOU PLACE FOUR OF THOSE HALVES LIKE THAT ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY UP 
FIRST OF ALL I'M GOING TO PUT A BIT OF CHOPPED LETTUCE THIS IS ICEBERG LETTUCE 
THEN I'VE GOT SOME SPRING ONION AND THIS HAS BEEN CUT IN SHREDS 
AND SHREDS OF CUCUMBER 
SOMEBODY SAID THE OTHER DAY IN AN ARTICLE 
COOKS ON THE TELEVISION THEY'VE ALWAYS GOT EVERYTHING PREPARED 
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT HOME BUT THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE AT HOME 
YOU PREPARE ALL THIS FIRST BEFORE YOU DO THIS 
NEXT IS ROASTED PEANUTS WHICH COME IN A PACK GIVE IT A BIT OF CRUNCH 
AND THEN CORIANDER 
AND NOW TWO MORE PRAWN HALVES 
AND YOU PUT IT WITH THE PINK SIDE OUT ROLL IT OVER TIGHTLY 
AND THEN YOU FOLD THE END IN LIKE THAT BOTH SIDES 
BE QUITE FIRM WITH IT 
AND ROLL IT ALL THE WAY ROUND LIKE THAT 
WHAT YOU CAN SEE IN THE LITTLE PARCEL IS THE PINK PRAWNS 
AND THE GREEN SHOWING THROUGH WHICH LOOKS REALLY PRETTY 
AND YOU NEED TO CUT ABOUT ONE CENTIMETRE IN EACH END DIAGONALLY 
BEAUTIFUL VIETNAMESE SPRING ROLLS 
WHICH ARE READY TO GO INTO A DIPPING SAUCE 
IF YOU WANT TO DO ASIAN COOKING 
COMMIT YOURSELF TO GETTING A FEW VERY SPECIAL INGREDIENTS HERE 
THEY'VE GOT A LONG SHELF LIFE THEY'LL LAST YOU A LONG TIME 
AND I TEND TO KEEP THEM I'VE GOT THIS LOVELY CONTAINER HERE 
I KEEP ALL MY ASIAN THINGS TOGETHER SO I'M NOT LOOKING IN THE BACK OF THE CUPBOARD TO FIND IT 
ALL THESE LOVELY INGREDIENTS REALLY DO COME INTO THEIR OWN 
WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A TABLESPOON OF JAPANESE SOY SAUCE BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST ONE 
INTO THE BOWL 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A TABLESPOON OF TOASTED SESAME OIL 
AND A DESSERTSPOON OF THAI FISH SAUCE OR VIETNAMESE FISH SAUCE 
WE'VE GOT THE JUICE OF A NICE FAT JUICY LIME 
AND I'M GOING TO PUT SOME CHILLI IN IT 
A HOT PIRI PIRI CHILLI BUT JUST ONE 
AND CUT IT IN HALF LENGTHWAYS LIKE THAT 
AND WITH THE TIP OF MY KNIFE SCOOP OUT THE SEEDS 
JUST CHOP THAT INTO VERY VERY SMALL PIECES 
I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE THAT A LITTLE WHISK 
I'VE GOT SPRING ONIONS THAT WE PUT INSIDE AND THE GREEN PART 
I'VE CHOPPED REALLY SMALL AND THAT FLOATS ON THE TOP OF THE DIPPING SAUCE 
YOU JUST TAKE ONE OF THESE 
AND YOU DIP IT INTO THE DIPPING SAUCE AND EAT IT 
FOR NO COOKING AND VERY LITTLE TIME THAT'S PRETTY SPECIAL 
WHILST I'M AT A RECIPE PHOTOSHOOT WITH VANESSA OUR DESIGNER 
SHE'S PERSUADED ME TO HAVE A PHOTO TAKEN 
I'M HOLDING MY STOMACH IN 
DO YOU ENJOY HAVING YOUR PHOTO TAKEN NO NO SHE DOESN'T SHE HATES IT

AND MELANIE AND I ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU REALISE THAT 
YOU CAN TICK WHAT YOU THINK I SHOULD DO AND WHAT I SHOULDN'T I'M HAPPY FOR YOU TO CHOOSE 
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER NEARLY FORTY YEARS 
AND I LOVE AND RESPECT HER PROBABLY MORE THAN ANYONE OUTSIDE MY FAMILY 
LET ME TELL YOU DELIA IS FUSSY 
BOY OH BOY I THINK THAT'S THE HARDEST THING 
I'VE HAD TO GET ACROSS TO PEOPLE IS HOW THREE DIMENSIONAL YOU ARE 
THERE JUST ISN'T ANY BIT OF THE PROJECT THAT YOU'RE NOT TOTALLY FOCUSED ON 
THE TABLE THAT ONE NO 
THAT ONE SORRY NO 
THAT'LL BE NICE WHEN IT'S A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER NO NO NO NO 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY'S AS DIFFICULT AS YOU 
AS DEMANDING 
YOU ARE 
YEAH THE ONE LOOKING DOWN IF YOU HAD THAT SMALL AND IT WASN'T TOO BIG 
THAT ONE THAT'S THE ONLY ONE I CAN LIVE WITH 
I'M HAPPY WITH THAT 
AND I USED TO BE A REAL PAIN IN THE NECK 
COS I USED TO BE RINGING HER UP EVERY MORNING NOON AND NIGHT 
WHAT DID YOU ALWAYS SAY TO ME 
DO YOU REMEMBER DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH COOKS 
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME ON THE PHONE WITH DELIA 
I MEAN SHE'S NEVER GOING TO MAKE US MUCH MONEY 
I LOVE THAT STORY 
I'M NOW GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE ASIAN STEAK SANDWICHES 
THESE ARE STICKY BITS OF FRAGRANT STEAK THAT ARE WRAPPED UP IN LETTUCE LEAVES BEFORE YOU EAT THEM 
IT'S QUITE FUN TO MAKE 
WE START WITH THE MARINADE HALF AN ONION A RED ONION 
AND TWO PIECES OF JALAPENO PEPPER 
I'M NOW GOING TO ADD SOME LEMONGRASS 
THIS IS A VERY GOOD WAY TO HAVE LEMONGRASS ALWAYS IN YOUR LARDER 
BECAUSE IT COMES IN BRINE YOU CAN JUST OPEN THE JAR 
TAKE OUT WHATEVER YOU NEED 
YOU PUT THE LID ON PUT IT BACK INTO THE FRIDGE AND THAT WILL KEEP FOR QUITE A LONG TIME 
I NEED TWO PIECES 
CUT THEM INTO THREE THEY'RE QUITE TOUGH SO THAT'S WHY IT'S GOOD TO CUT THEM UP BEFORE THEY GO IN HERE 
I'M GOING TO ADD SOME MORE THAI INGREDIENTS 
I'VE GOT A TABLESPOON OF THAI FISH SAUCE 
SOME SESAME OIL AND THIS TIME A DESSERTSPOON 
AND THEN ANOTHER DESSERTSPOON OF GROUNDNUT OIL OR SIMILAR FLAVOURLESS OIL 
THEN THE STICKY BIT A DESSERTSPOON OF SOFT BROWN SUGAR 
THERE WE GO 
I'VE GOT A PIECE OF STEAK HERE WHICH IS ABOUT TWO TWENTY G. 
WHICH IS ENOUGH FOR SANDWICHES FOR TWO PEOPLE 
CUT IT INTO SMALL STRIPS WITH A SHARP KNIFE 
WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS SIRLOIN STEAK 
BUT YOU CAN USE RUMP STEAK OR RIB EYE STEAK WHATEVER STEAK YOU LIKE 
WHATEVER IT IS IT'S NICE IF YOU CAN GET IT QUITE THICK SO YOU CAN CUT STRIPS 
A FEW LITTLE BITS AT THE END BUT THAT WON'T MATTER 
NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY GO INTO THE MARINADE 
WE'LL POP THEM ALL IN 
I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE MY SPOON HERE AND PRESS IT DOWN SO THAT THE MARINADE 
COVERS ALL THE PIECES OF STEAK 
IF YOU ARE IN A REAL HURRY YOU COULD COOK THESE STRAIGHTAWAY 
THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO TAKE A MINUTE TO COOK 
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT IN A REAL HURRY WHAT WOULD BE NICE IS TO COME HOME FROM WORK PUT THEM IN THERE 
GO AND HAVE A GLASS OF WINE PUT YOUR FEET UP 
WATCH THE NEWS WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO AND THEN COOK THEM A BIT LATER 
WHATEVER YOU WANT IT'S TO FIT YOU 
I COME HERE EVERY MORNING AND THEN USUALLY ABOUT HALF AN HOUR IN THE EVENING AS WELL 
IT'S JUST LIKE A LITTLE STUDY AND IT'S WONDERFUL 
BECAUSE THERE'S NO PHONES NO HOOVERS NO NOISE 
AND IT'S A REALLY GOOD PLACE TO WRITE AND I DO A LOT OF WRITING 
JUST WHAT I NEEDED 
THE DISADVANTAGE OF LIVING IN THE COUNTRY 
IS COS YOU'RE OUT OF ALL THE TRENDINESS 
AND WHATEVER'S COOL AND WHAT ISN'T COOL 
BUT I'M NOT COOL SO IT'S NICE FOR ME TO BE OUT IN THE COUNTRY 
THAT WAS JOHN PEEL SAID THAT 
JOHN PEEL SAID I WAS THE MOST UNCOOL PERSON HE'D EVER MET 
NOW THE STRIPS OF STEAK ARE READY TO COOK 
WHAT I DID HERE FIRST OF ALL 
WAS BRUSH THE FRYING PAN WITH OIL AND GOT IT REALLY HOT 
NOW THE LITTLE STRIPS ARE GOING IN 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS EACH SIDE 
AND THEY SHOULD BE NICE AND TOASTED 
AND CHARRED ON THE OUTSIDE 
THEN TURN THEM OVER AND GIVE THEM ANOTHER THIRTY SECONDS ON THE OTHER SIDE 
SANDWICH TIME THE IDEA IS TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN SIT DOWN 
HAVE LOTS OF NAPKINS HANDY AND PERHAPS A FINGER BOWL TO RINSE YOUR HANDS IN 
AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IS TAKE A PIECE OF ICEBERG LETTUCE BECAUSE IT'S NICE AND CRISP 
AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IT PUT A PIECE OF STEAK INTO THE LETTUCE LEAF 
AND THEN SOME STRANDS OF CUCUMBER CUT LONG AND THIN 
AND THEN SOME STRANDS OF SPRING ONION CUT IN THE SAME WAY 
A COUPLE OF SPRIGS OF CORIANDER 
THAT JUST GETS ROLLED UP 
AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IS PUT IT INTO A DIPPING SAUCE AGAIN 
THE DIPPING SAUCE IS THIS ONE HERE 
IT'S SIMILAR TO THE ONE WE HAD BEFORE ONLY THIS ONE'S GOT SOME RICE VINEGAR IN IT 
SO IT'S KIND OF A SWEET AND SOUR DIPPING SAUCE 
IN THAT GOES TO THERE 
LIFT IT UP AND ENJOY 
ONE OF THE BEST EVENINGS OUT FOR MICHAEL AND ME 
IS TO ENJOY A REALLY GOOD INDIAN WITH A GROUP OF SPECIAL FRIENDS 
SUE MATT AND SHEILA AND ALAN HANSEN AND HIS WIFE JANET 
ARE PART OF OUR REGULAR CURRY EVENINGS 
I ALWAYS FEEL REALLY HUNGRY IF I'M COMING ANYWHERE NEAR CURRY 
I'VE JUST GOT TO GET THE AROMA AND I JUST FEEL REALLY HUNGRY 
SO IT'S GOOD FUN AND I ALSO LIKE THE FACT THAT IT'S A VERY SHARING THING 
EVERYBODY'S HAVING A BIT OF EVERYBODY ELSE'S AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY GOOD 
THE LAST TIME WE WERE HERE WAS BETTER THAN A GOOD NIGHT OH YEAH IT WAS 
BETTER THAN A GOOD NIGHT LAST TIME 
BETTER THAN A GOOD NIGHT 
AND I'M STILL LIVING TO TELL THE TALE 
DO YOU COOK CURRIES AT HOME 
I DON'T COOK AT ALL 
MY WIFE IS A VERY GOOD COOK BUT SHE DOESN'T COOK CURRIES DO YOU 
NO I DON'T I MIGHT DO AFTER WE SEE DELIA'S COOKERY PROGRAMME DOES HE DO ANY COOKING 
VERY BASIC STUFF 
THIS WOULD BE A BIG TEST FOR ME 
NO A BIGGER TEST FOR DELIA 
IT'S ANOTHER SERIES TWO SERIES 
AND IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SHE'S PROMISED ME 
CHEERS 
CHEERS
