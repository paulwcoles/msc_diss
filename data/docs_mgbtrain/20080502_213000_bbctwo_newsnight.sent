NEW LONDON MAYOR 
TONIGHT HUGE LABOUR LOSSES ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY FROM THE HEARTLANDS TO 
THEIR NEW LABOUR SUBURBS AND IT 
LOOKS LIKE KEN'S LOST LONDON HOW 
MUCH OF THE BLAME CAN BE LAID AT 
GORDON BROWN'S FRONT GATE THEY ARE 
CHASTENED TONIGHT BUT WILL THEY 
CHANGE 
IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS HAS CHANGE BEEN A DISAPPOINTING NIGHT INDEED 
A BAD NIGHT FOR LABOUR WE HAVE 
LESSONS TO LEARN FROM THAT 
IS THIS JUST THE MID TERM BLUES OR 
THE START OF NEW TORY ERA NO NO SEAT IS ENTIRELY SAFE THE WORLD 
HAS MOVED ON SINCE THEN 
TONIGHT WE WILL HEAR WHERE THIS 
CABINET MINISTER THINKS IT'S GONE 
WRONG WE WILL HAVE ANALYSIS FROM 
OUR POLITICAL PANEL AND THOSE 
RESULTS FROM THE MAYORAL RACE AS 
SOON AS THEY COME 
AND ON NEWSNIGHT REVIEW AT ELEVEN P. M. 
WITH TOM PAULIN SARAH CHURCHWELL 
AND MICHAEL GOVE ROBERT DOWNEY 
JUNIOR UPDATED AND ENLISTED FOR 
THE WAR ON TERROR 
I AM NOT THAT HE 
WROTE TYPE 
VANESSA REDGRAVE BRINGS 
THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THEORY 
MAGICAL THINKING TO THE NATIONAL 
THEATRE THEATRE TIM WINTON'S NEW NOVEL BREATH 
AND A SPRAY CAN FESTIVAL CURATED 
BY BANKSY 
GOOD EVENING 
THE TORIES IT SEEMS ARE BACK 
THEIR NET GAINS IN COUNCILS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES HAVE GONE BEYOND 
WHAT THEY WOULD EVER ADMIT THEY 
DREAMED OF WINNING AND TONIGHT THE 
TOP PRIZE THE JOB OF LONDON MAYOR 
SEEMS ABOUT TO FALL INTO THE HANDS 
OF BORIS JOHNSON LABOUR HAS 
PERFORMED WORSE UNDER GORDON BROWN 
THAN AT ANY TIME IN THE LAST FORTY 
YEARS TONIGHT WE WILL BE ASSESSING 
WHETHER THE PRIME MINISTER CAN 
STAGE A POLITICAL COMEBACK AND 
WHETHER THIS REPRESENTS A VOTE IN 
FAVOUR OF THE CONSERVATIVES OR 
AGAINST LABOUR AND AS SOON AS THAT 
LONDON 
IN WE WILL BRING 
IT TO YOU FIRST LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
AT THE OVERALL PICTURE 
THE CONSERVATIVES WON MORE COUNCIL 
SEATS THAN THE OTHER TWO MAIN 
PARTIES WITH ALL THE LOCAL 
ELECTION RESULTS NOW IN THEY HAVE 
WON TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX COUNCILLORS LABOUR BY 
CONTRAST SUFFERED A NET LOSS OF 
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE COUNCILLORS WHILE THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS HAVE A NET GAIN 
OF THIRTY FOUR 
TRANSLATED INTO A NATIONAL SHARE OF 
THE VOTE THAT WOULD PUT THE TORIES 
ON FORTY FOUR PER CENT THEIR HIGHEST SHARE SINCE 
NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE LIB DEMS ON TWENTY FIVE PER CENT WHICH 
MORE OR LESS KEEPS THEM TREADING 
WATER AND LABOUR WITH THEIR 
LOWEST SHARE FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS 
IN THIRD PLACE WITH TWENTY FOUR PER CENT 
NOW THEY CALLED HIM A JOKE A 
BUFFOON A CHAT SHOW HOST AND A 
GAFFE PRONE ECCENTRIC BUT IT LOOKS 
LIKE BORIS JOHNSON HAS BEEN ELECTED 
MAYOR OF LONDON DAVID GROSSMAN IS 
AT CITY HALL FOR US WE ARE WAITING 
FOR CONFIRMATION WHAT HAVE YOU 
HEARD 
THEY ARE STILL COUNTING THE HEARD VOTES THEY ARE BEING BROUGHT INTO 
THE BUILDING IN FRONT OF ME CITY 
HALL WE HAVE AN INDICATION OF THE 
TURNOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE PEOPLE VOTED 
IN LONDON THAN FOUR YEARS AGO AND 
WE HAVE FOUR OUT OF THE FOURTEEN 
CONSTITUENCIES IN LONDON FOR THE 
REST WE ARE HAVING TO MAKE GUESSES 
BASED ON THE BAR CHARTS PRESENTED 
ON A SCREEN ON THE BASIS OF THAT 
AND THIS IS TENTATIVE IT LOOKS 
LIKE BORIS JOHNSON HAS SOMETHING 
LIKE FORTY SIX PER CENT OF THE VOTE AND KEN 
LIVINGSTONE HAS SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT 
THAT WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH WITHOUT 
SECOND PREFERENCE VOTES BEING TAKEN 
INTO ACCOUNT WE CANNOT SAY QUITE 
WHAT THE SECOND PREFERENCE VOTES 
WILL BE HOWEVER IF YOU THINK THIS 
SOUNDS TENTATIVE FRANKLY IT IS 
HOWEVER NONE OF THE PARTY'S ARE 
SAYING IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE BORIS 
JOHNSON AS ONE IT DOES NOT LOOK 
LIKE THERE ARE ENOUGH SECOND 
PREFERENCE VOTES IN ORDER THAT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE COULD WIN FROM EARLY 
THIS MORNING IT HAS LOOKED LIKE 
LONDON IS GOING TO CHANGE HANDS 
KEN LIVINGSTONE NEVER LOOKS EXACTLY 
CHEERFUL BUT THIS MORNING HE DID 
NOT HAVE MUCH CAUSE TO SMILE HIS 
PARTY HAD AFTER ALL SUFFERED ITS 
WORST NIGHT OF ELECTIONS SINCE 
BEFORE SOME OF THE PRESENT CABINET 
WERE BORN 
IT WOULD BE REMARKABLE 
TO HANG ON TO LONDON BUT NONE OF 
US KNOW 
WHAT IS YOUR GUT FEELING 
MY GUT FEELING IS THAT I WILL 
NARROWLY WIN 
AS HE WAITED FOR HIS 
BUS THE DEPUTY LEADER OF HIS PARTY 
HARRIET HARMAN WAS TELLING AN 
INTERVIEWER THAT LABOUR'S FORTUNES 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY WOULD PROBABLY 
BE REFLECTED IN THE LONDON RESULTS 
MEANING A WIN FOR BORIS JOHNSON 
FOR BORIS JOHNSON THOUGH HARRIET 
HARMAN IS NOT NEARLY FAT ENOUGH TO 
SING AN END TO THIS CONTEST 
HARRIET HARMAN THINKS YOU 
HAVE ONE 
I WOULD NOT TRUST HARRIET 
HARMAN'S POLITICAL JUDGMENT 
COUNTING AT THREE CENTRES ACROSS 
LONDON BEGAN AT EIGHT THIRTY AM THE BALLOT 
PAPERS WERE FED INTO MACHINES 
THREE PAPERS FOR EACH VOTER THIS 
WAS GOING TO BE A LONG JOB ACROSS 
TOWN AT CITY HALL RUNNING 
INDICATION EARLY EXPECTATIONS 
WHO DO YOU THINK HAS THE CHAMPAGNE 
READY AND WHO IS GETTING THEIR 
POST ELECTION JOB APPLICATIONS IN 
I THINK IT WILL BE VERY LARGE 
BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES AND LABOUR I 
SUSPECT WILL BE LOOKING FOR 
SOMETHING CHEAPER PLONKER THEY THEY HAVE BEEN COUNTING FOR NINE HOURS 
AND WE STILL SEEM TO BE HOURS AWAY 
FROM A RESULT IT IS EXACTLY ELEVEN 
YEARS AGO THAT TONY BLAIR STOOD ON 
A STAGE JUST DOWN THE RIVER AT THE 
ROYAL FESTIVAL HALL AND PROCLAIMED 
A NEW DAWN HAD BROKEN IT WAS THE 
FIRST DAY OF THE LABOUR 
ADMINISTRATION IT IS TOO EARLY TO 
SAY THE SUN IS SETTING ON LABOUR 
BRITAIN BUT ALREADY SOME MINISTERS 
ARE TALKING ABOUT THE NEED FOR 
SOBER SERIOUS REFLECTION WHAT ARE 
WE SEEING HERE 
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT 
THE FINAL RESULT IS IT IS ABOUT 
FIVE THIRTY P. M. AND THE REPORTS ARE THAT 
BORIS JOHNSON IS AHEAD BUT NOT ALL 
OVER LONDON AND I THINK THAT 
LET'S SIT OUT WHAT MAY BE QUITE A 
LONG NIGHT AND REFLECT ON IT AT THE 
END THIS WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A CONTEST 
BETWEEN TWO BIG FIGURES BUT YOU 
CANNOT SEAL THE IMPACT OF THE WIDER 
ANXIETY THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THE 
ECONOMY OUT OF THE CAMPAIGN 
ALTOGETHER SO THAT UNDOUBTEDLY 
IMPINGED THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO 
REFLECT ON WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TOLD US 
AS GORDON BROWN HAS SAID CLEARLY 
THAT IS WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO BUT 
WE THEN HAVE TO ACT ON WHAT PEOPLE 
HAVE TOLD US AND HE IS THE PERSON 
TO LEAD US THROUGH THIS 
THAT MIGHT 
BE AN UNCOMFORTABLE PROCESS IT IT MIGHT BE A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE 
PROCESS IF YOU ARE TOLD 
UNPALATABLE TRUTHS IT IS AN 
UNCOMFORTABLE PROCESS BUT WE HAVE 
TO LOOK AT THIS STRAIGHT IN THE EYE 
AND IF WE ARE GOING TO SERVE THE 
PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AS WE ARE 
IN POLITICS TO DO WE HAVE TO TAKE 
SERIOUSLY THE MESSAGE THEY ARE 
GIVING US 
LABOUR HAVE BEEN GETTING 
READY TO THE NEW REALITY THAT 
LONDON MIGHT BE ABOUT TO CHANGE 
HANDS FROM EARLY THIS MORNING THE 
QUESTION IS WHY HAS LONDON IF IT 
HAS TURNED ITS BACK ON KEN 
LIVINGSTONE I THINK THE ANSWER IS 
THAT KEN LIVINGSTONE THE 
INSULATION THAT PROTECTED HIM FROM 
THE WOES THAT BESET HIS PARTY FOUR 
YEARS AGO HE WAS MUCH MORE 
POPULAR THAN HIS PARTY IN LONDON 
FOUR YEARS AGO THAT HAS 
DISAPPEARED PART OF THAT IS 
PROBABLY THE LENGTH OF TIME HE HAS 
BEEN IN OFFICE BUT THEY HAVE ALSO 
BEEN SEVERAL SCANDALS THAT HAVE 
SURROUNDED HIM ABOUT HIS ADVISERS 
AND ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MANY 
IN LONDON ON TOP OF THAT BORIS 
JOHNSON PLAYED A CLEVER CAMPAIGN 
HE DID NOT MAKE ANY OF THE GAFFES 
THAT WERE EXPECTED IT WAS THOUGHT 
IT WOULD BE A VERY ENTERTAINING 
CAMPAIGN BUT HE DID NOT MAKE ANY OF 
THE SPECTACULAR HOWLERS THAT WOULD 
HAVE ENDED UP ON THE FRONT PAGES 
AND LAY HEALTH PUT SOME LONDONERS 
OFF FROM VOTING FOR HIM IN TERMS 
OF THE RESULT I AM TOLD THAT IN 
THE CENTRAL COLLATING AREA THEY 
HAVE FIRM NUMBERS ON TEN OF THE FOURTEEN 
RESULTS ON THE OTHER FOUR RESULTS 
THEY ARE WITHIN ONE PER CENT OR TWO PER CENT OF A 
COMPLETE SET OF NUMBERS BUT IT 
WILL STILL BE AT LEAST FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
BEFORE WE GET THE FINAL DECLARATION 
DESPITE THEIR STRONG SHOWING IN THE 
LOCAL ELECTION AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE 
A WIN IN THE LONDON MAYORAL CONTEST 
THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WERE UNABLE 
TO FIND A SHADOW CABINET MINISTER 
TO COME ON THE PROGRAMME BUT WE 
ARE JOINED BY THE TRANSPORT 
SECRETARY RUTH KELLY THANK YOU 
FOR COMING IN WE WILL LOOK AT THE 
BROADER PICTURE IN A MOMENT BUT 
WOULD YOU TAKE THE EVENING STANDARD 
AT FACE VALUE WHEN IT CALLS IT FOR 
BORIS 
HE MAY HAVE WON BUT WE HAVE BORIS TO WAIT FOR THE FINAL RESULTS BUT 
LET ME JUST SAY IF BORIS HAS 
EMERGED AS THE VICTOR I WILL BE 
VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I THINK 
KEN LIVINGSTONE HAS BEEN A 
TREMENDOUS MAYOR L. HAVE WORKED 
CLOSELY WITH HIM AS TRANSPORT 
SECRETARY I THINK IT WAS LARGELY 
DOWN TO KEN LIVINGSTONE WORKING 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT WE MANAGED 
TO SECURE THE CROSSRAIL DEAL YOU YOU MIGHT NOT BE THE ONLY ONE 
DISAPPOINTED IF HE LOSES WOULD HE 
BE RIGHT TO BLAME GORDON BROWN I I DON'T THINK SO L. THINK HE HAS 
PROBABLY LOST FOR A VARIETY OF 
REASONS AND IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME 
TO WORK OUT WHY PARTLY BECAUSE 
BORIS IS A FANTASTIC POLITICIAN WHO 
HAS RUN A GOOD CAMPAIGN 
SO THIS 
WAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LABOUR'S 
UNPOPULARITY 
I AM SURE LONDON UNPOPULARITY REFLECTED PARTLY THE NATIONAL 
PICTURE AS IT PARTLY REFLECTED ITS 
OWN UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WILL 
TAKE TIME TO LEARN THE LESSONS AND 
WORK OUT WHAT HAS GONE ON LONDON 
HAS SPOKEN LOUD AND CLEAR AND HAS 
SENT A MESSAGE TO THE GOVERNMENT AS 
WELL AS REFLECTING ITS INDIVIDUAL 
VIEWS ON KEN LIVINGSTONE AND BORIS 
JOHNSON AND IT WILL TAKE TIME TO 
LEARN THOSE LESSONS 
GORDON BROWN 
CALLED THE NIGHT OF THE LOCAL 
ELECTION RESULTS A DISAPPOINTMENT 
I GUESS THE WORD MELTDOWN DOES NOT 
SOUND GOOD FROM THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S MOUTH BUT THERE WAS NO 
DISGUISING WHAT HE MEANT MICHAEL 
CHRIS THE SAP MICHAEL CRICK 
ASSESSES THE NIGHT FOR LABOUR 
IT HAS BEEN THE MOST JUBILANT TWENTY FOUR 
HOURS FOR THE CONSERVATIVES IN MORE 
THAN TWENTY YEARS AS DAVID CAMERON'S 
PARTIES SEIZED TOWN HALLS BEYOND 
THEIR WILDEST HOPES FULFILLING 
MANY OF LABOUR'S VERY WORST FEARS 
THEY SAID WE COULD NOT WIN COUNCILS 
IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND IN 
BURY YOU HAVE SHOWN THE WAY 
COUNCILS CHANGED HANDS UP AND DOWN 
THE COUNTRY THE TORIES WON MOST OF 
THEIR TARGETS AND SOME SURPRISES 
TOO SOUTHAMPTON NUNEATON AND WEST 
LINDSEY BUT THEY LOST CONTROL OF 
COVENTRY AND COLCHESTER LABOUR'S 
LOSSES WERE STARK 
IT CAME AS NO SURPRISE AROUND 
ONE THIRTY AM WHEN THE TORIES TOOK CONTROL 
OF ONE OF THEIR PRIME TARGETS THE 
LANCASHIRE TOWN OF BURY WHERE IN 
RECENT WEEKS BOTH LABOUR M. P.'S HAVE 
EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT 
WHERE THE BROWN GOVERNMENT IS GOING 
THE HEALTH MINISTER IVAN LEWIS M. P. 
FOR BURY SOUTH WHO RECENTLY SPOKE 
OF LABOUR LOSING TOUCH THIS 
MORNING WENT FURTHER 
THE DANGER IS 
AFTER A LONG PERIOD IN GOVERNMENT 
YOU LOOK LIKE A NEW ELITE AND YOU 
DO NOT LOOK LIKE THE VOICE OF THE 
PEOPLE IN WESTMINSTER YOU LOOK 
LIKE THE VOICE OF WESTMINSTER TO 
THE PEOPLE THAT IS NOT THE ROLE OF 
NEW LABOUR WE HAVE TO BE THE PARTY 
THAT SPEAKS TO THE CONCERNS OF 
HARD WORKING FAMILIES AND RELATES 
TO THEIR EVERYDAY PRESSURES 
EQUALLY WE HAVE TO BE THE PARTY ON 
THE SIDE OF AMBITION AND ASPIRATION 
AND ALSO THE IDEALISTIC PARTY 
BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONLY PARTY THAT 
BELIEVES IN ELIMINATING POVERTY 
WHETHER IT IS CHILD POVERTY OF 
PENSIONER POVERTY 
TWENTY FOUR PER CENT SHARE THAT'S PROJECTED AS IF 
THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS HAD VOTED IS 
THOUGHT TO BE THE WORST FOR 
GOVERNING PARTY IN MODERN TIMES 
EVEN JOHN MAJOR AT HIS LOW POINT 
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE FARED SLIGHTLY BETTER WITH 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT WHILE MARGARET THATCHER IN HER 
WORST YEARS NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NINETEEN NINETY 
BEFORE SHE WAS OUSTED GOT 
RESPECTED THIRTY TWO PER CENT ONLY HAROLD WILSON 
DID WORSE IN COUNCIL POLLS 
ALTHOUGH NOBODY KNOWS THE EXACT 
FIGURES TWO YEARS BEFORE HE LOST 
POWER GORDON BROWN DIDN'T STAY UP 
FOR LAST NIGHT'S RESULTS BUT HAD TO 
ADMIT THIS MORNING THEY WERE BAD 
IT IS CLEAR TO ME THIS HAS BEEN A 
DISAPPOINTING INDEED A BAD NIGHT 
FOR LABOUR WE HAVE LESSONS TO 
LEARN FROM THAT AND THEN WE WILL 
MOVE FORWARD MY JOB IS TO LISTEN 
AND TO LEAD THAT IS WHAT I'LL DO 
WHAT ARE GORDON BROWN'S OPTIONS TO 
FIGHT BACK A RESHUFFLE PROBLEM Y. 
WON'T HAPPEN SOON AND HE SAID HE 
WON'T RETREAT ON THE NEXT BIG ROW 
FORTY TWO DAYS DETENTION FOR SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS EXPECT NEW MEASURES ON 
THE ECONOMY HEALTH EDUCATION AND 
THE CONSTITUTION WITH THIS YEAR'S 
DRAFT QUEEN'S SPEECH LIKELY WITHIN 
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS MR. BROWN HAS 
ONLY SIX MONTHS TO IMPROVE ONE 
LEFT WING MACHINE SAID TODAY OR HE 
IS 
IS IN BIG TROUBLE 
TO DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT THE POORER PEOPLE IN SOCIETY 
IS WHAT THE ISSUE IS B. TOO MANY 
PEOPLE ARE NOT EXCITED BY THE FACT 
THAT THE RICH SEEM TO GET RICH AND 
THE POORER POORER IN THE TWENTY FIRST 
CENTURY WE COULD DO A LOT BETTER L. 
THINK BROWN IS THE MAN TO DO IT 
I'LL GIVE HIM SIX MONTHS TO DO IT 
OR THERE WILL BE REALLY HARD 
TALKING 
LABOUR'S PROBLEMS GOT TALKING WORSE TODAY THAT THE PARTY'S NEW 
GENERAL SECRETARY WILL NOT TAKE THE 
JOB IT WAS SOME WEEKS THAG THAT 
DAVID PITMAN WAS CHOSEN NOW HE HAS 
WITHDRAWN 
THIS HAS TO BE RESOLVED WITHDRAWN AS A MATTER OF URGENCY THERE'S 
NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT ALONGSIDE 
THE CHANGES WE NEED TO MAKE IN 
GOVERNMENT TO GET OUR PARTY IN A 
SHAPE WHERE WE CAN FIGHT AND WIN AN 
ELECTION THAT WE OWE TO THE PARTY 
MEMBERS AND ACTIVISTS THE MESSAGE 
WAS TO TEAM LABOUR AT WESTMINSTER 
IT WASN'T TO LOCAL COUNCILLORS AND 
ACTIVISTS WHO HAVE DONE ALL THEY 
CAN AND WORKED REALLY REALLY HARD 
THE MESSAGE IT WASN'T JUST TO 
GORDON BROWN IT WAS TO ALL OF US 
AT WESTMINSTER WE HAVE TO SHAPE UP 
THIS WEEKEND AND BACK AT 
WESTMINSTER AFTER THE BANK HOLIDAY 
LABOUR'S INQUEST WILL NO DOUBT GO 
ON WE'LL SEE IF TODAY'S SHOCK AND 
ANGER IN PARTY RANKS TURN TO 
RECRIMINATION AND MAYBE RESOLT 
MICHAEL IS WITH ME HOW DO WE KNOW 
IF THIS IS REAL TURNING 
I MEAN 
THE FIGURES ARE SERIOUS AS YOU SAW 
FROM MY PIECE LABOUR IS DOWN TO 
THE KIND OF LEVELS THAT JOHN MAJOR 
WAS SUFFERING AND MARGARET THATCHER 
AND HAROLD WILSON NOT LONG BEFORE 
THEY ALL IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER LOST 
OFFICE AND ONE IS REMINDED OF THE 
COMMENTS BY JIM CALLAGHAN TO HIS 
ADVISER SHORTLY BEFORE HE LOST IN 
NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE SEA 
CHANGE OF FORCES THAT IT'S 
IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST IF YOU TALK 
TO SENIOR LABOUR PEOPLE THEY 
CONSOLE THEMSELVES WITH A NUMBER OF 
THOUGHTS FIRST THEY HAVE TIME ON 
THEIR HANDS IT IS ANOTHER TWO 
YEARS BEFORE THEY HAVE TO FIGHT A 
GENERAL ELECTION SECONDLY I FEEL 
THEY ARE IN A UNFORTUNATE 
COINCIDENCE OF MIDTERM BLUES 
TRADITIONAL IN ANY GOVERNMENT 
COINCIDING WITH A DOWN TURN IN THE 
ECONOMY WHICH DOESN'T OFTEN 
COINCIDE IN THAT WAY THE OTHER 
CONSOLATION SENIOR LABOUR PEOPLE 
COME OUT WITH THEY BELIEVE A 
STRANGE THOUGHT THAT THEY HAVE 
LOST THE ARGUMENTS RATHER THAN THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE WINNING IT THAT 
MEANS THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 
THEY BELIEVE TO TURN THAT AROUND 
AND STOP LOSING THE ARGUMENT 
HAVING SAID THAT I THINK IF YOU 
TALK TO A LOT OF LABOUR M. P.'S AND 
ACTIVISTS DESPITE WHAT IAN GIBSON 
AND IVAN LEWIS WERE SAYING IN THE 
FILM THERE'S A FEELING THERE'S 
NOTHING OBVIOUS REALLY THAT IS 
GOING TO TURN THIS AROUND EITHER 
IN TERMS OF POLICY VISION OR 
PHILOSOPHY PERSONNEL THE CHANGE IN 
THE LEADERSHIP AND TO SOME EXTENT 
THAT'S TO GORDON BROWN'S ADVANTAGE 
BECAUSE THERE'S NO OBVIOUSLY 
DAZZLING PERSON WAITING IN THE 
WINGS THAT EVERYBODY SAYS THEY 
WILL DO 
LET'S TAKE YOU BACK TO THE 
TRANSPORT SECRETARY RUTH KELLY DO 
YOU ACCEPT THAT A MESSAGE TO TEAM 
LABOUR TO GET INTO SHAPE WHERE DID 
IT GO WRONG 
I ACCEPT THIS HAD BEEN 
A MESSAGE DELIVERED BY THE 
ELECTORATE IT IS CLEAR IT IS A 
TERRIBLE PERFORMANCE FOR LABOUR 
CLEARLY PEOPLE WERE NOT JUST 
SENDING A MESSAGE TO LABOUR 
COUNCILLORS AND ACTIVISTS THEY WERE 
SENDING A MESSAGE TO THE GOVERNMENT 
WE HAVE TO REFLECT ON WHAT IT MEANS 
AND RESPOND TO THAT IT IS NOT 
TERRIBLY SURPRISING IN A TIME OF 
ENORMOUS ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY 
PEOPLE ARE FEELING VERY VERY 
ANXIOUS ABOUT THEIR PROSPECTS AND AND VERY VULNERABLE WHAT WE HAVE BEEN 
HEARING THERE'S A DEEP SEATED GUT 
REVULSION ABOUT LABOUR DESERTING 
ITS WORKING CLASS 
I DON'T KNOW 
THERE'S A RESULGS WHEN I WAS OUT 
ON CANVASSING ON THE DOORSTEPS WHAT 
I DIDN'T SEE WAS HOARDS OF PEOPLE 
TURNING FROM THE TORIES LABOUR TO 
THE TORIES THEY WERE SAYING WHAT 
ARE YOU DOING FOR US FOOD PRICES 
ARE RISING AND MORTGAGES ARE 
DIFFICULT 
COUNTLESS LABOUR SALT OF DIFFICULT THE EARTH TYPES WHO SAID THEY HAD 
NOT VOTED BECAUSE THE B. N. P. WERE NOT 
STANDING THESE HAVE FELT LET DOWN 
BY YOU THEY MADE THEIR FEELINGS 
KNOWN WITH THE TEN P. KNOWN WITH THE 
TAX RATE AND THEY WON'T FOR GIVE 
YOU 
WE HAVE TO GET RESPONDING TO YOU THE PEOPLE'S CONCERNS SHOWING THEY 
ARE IN TURF WITH PEOPLE'S EVERYBODY 
DAY LIVES AND CAN RESPOND TO THAT 
THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE TEN P. TAX 
WHEN THE BUDGET WAS SENT A YEAR AGO 
CUTTING THE 
THIS IS GORDON 
BROWN'S DECISION HIS INTRODUCTION 
FIRST TO THE TEN P. RATE AND THEN 
SCRAPPING IT 
CUTTING THE BASIC 
RATE WAS A TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT 
SOMETHING THAT RELIED ON THE TEN P. 
RATE SOMETHING A YEAR AGO LOOKS 
SENSIBLE BUT IN TODAY'S CLIMATE 
DIDN'T GO DOWN WELL 
WE HAVE HEARD 
FROM EVERY CABINET MINISTER THAT 
THEY ARE LISTENING WHAT DOES THAT 
TRANSLATE INTO IN TERMS OF THE 
THINGS YOU HAVE DONE WRONG WHAT 
WILL YOU PUT RIGHT 
WE HAVE GOT TO 
BE IN TOUCH WITH PEOPLE'S REAL 
CONCERNS AND WE HAVE GOT TO BE 
LEADING AND SHOWING WE CAN TAKE 
PEOPLE THROUGH DIFFICULT ECONOMIC 
TERMS 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN KEEPING TERMS KEEPING THE POLICIES IN PLACE FOR INSTANCE 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND INJECTING 
LIQUIDITY MAKING SURE THAT THE 
PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET 
ON TO THE HOUSING LADDER 
WHAT DOES 
THAT MEAN THE BANK OF ENGLAND WE WE PUT INTO PLACE THE SYSTEM WE'RE 
PUTTING INTO PLACE THE EQUITY 
SCHEMES THAT MEANS YOUNG FAMILIES 
WILL BE ABLE TO GET ON TO THE 
HOUSING LADDER CONTINUING TO BUILD 
THE NUMBER OF HOUSES PEOPLE NEED 
PREPARING FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWN TURN 
FOR WHAT WILL BECOME A ECONOMIC 
UPTURN AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE WILL 
HAVE THE SKILLS TO BENEFIT OVER 
TIME PEOPLE WILL SEE THAT THE 
POLICIES THAT GORDON BROWN HAVE PUT 
IN PLACE TOGETHER WITH THE CABINET 
ARE THE POLICIES NEEDED TO PULL IT 
THROUGH 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ELEVEN THROUGH YEARS TO THE DAY OF LABOUR IF THEY 
ARE NOT UNDERSTANDING THAT NOW OR 
IF THE REVOLT OR THE SENSE OF 
LETTING DOWN IS COMING NOW YOU 
HAVE SHOWN THEPBL WHAT YOU HAVE TO 
OFFER AND THEY 
DON'T WANT IT L. DON'T AGREE L. ADMIT MISTAKES WERE 
MADE THIS IS A COINCIDENCE OF 
FACTORS THERE ARE A MIDTERM BLEWS 
CLEARLY THAT HAS COME ALONG AT THE 
SAME TIME AS A INTERNATIONAL CREDIT 
CRUNCH PEOPLE ARE ON THE DOORSTEPS 
FEELING THE PINCH FOR THE FIRST 
TIME FOR A VERY LONG TIME THEY WERE 
BECOMING UNSURE ABOUT THE ECONOMIC 
FUTURE WHEN HE WAS CHANCELLOR YOU 
HAILED HIM AS THE BEST EUROPE HAD 
SEEN AND HOW NOW HE HAS IT HAS 
GONE WRONG YOU'RE POINTING TO HIM 
TO SAVE IT 
WE SAID WE WERE A ERS 
A FANTASTIC CHANCELLOR WE WEREN'T 
THE ONLY ONES THE I. M. F. RATED THE 
BRITISH ECONOMY AS THE BEST 
PERFORMING IN THE WORLD AND THEY 
CONTINUE TO AS THEY CONTINUE TO 
FORECAST CONTINUING GROWTH AND JOBS 
WE HAVE AN OUTSTANDING CHANCELLOR 
AND SOMEONE AS PRIME MINISTER TO 
PUT THROUGH THE POLICIES TO SEE US 
THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL DOWN TURN 
AND PREPARE US FOR THE UPTURN YOU YOU ACCEPT THAT THE TEN P. ABOLITION WAS A 
MISTAKE WHAT ARE THE OTHER 
MISTAKES YOU HAVE TO RECOGNISE TO 
WIN 
IN THE CONTEXT LAST YEAR IT WIN WAS A SENSIBLE MOVE WE DIDN'T 
RESPOND TO THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE 
FAST ENOUGH AND LISTEN TO THE REAL 
CONCERNS PEOPLE HAD ABOUT THEIR OWN 
ECONOMIC PROCESS SPERTD AND THE 
FAMILY'S FORTUNE 
THAT WAS THE ONLY 
REASON THAT THE TEN P. TAX WAS 
REVERSED 
NO BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE REVERSED FEELING THE PINCH FUEL PRICES ARE 
RISING 
YOU ARE BEING TOO RISING COMPLACENT IF THIS IS THE 
GOVERNMENT BEING IN TOUCH AND 
LISTENING TO AND GOING BACK TO THE 
ELECTORATE YOU CAN'T KEEP FALLING 
BACK ON THE COMPLACENCY MORE MORE IMPORTANT IS SOMEONE WHO HAS THE 
SKILLS TO SEE THROUGH THE DIFFICULT 
TIMES AS WELL AS THAT WE HAVE TO 
FOCUS ON THE BREAD AND BUTTER 
ISSUES DEALING WITH CRIME AND 
IMMIGRATION AND A FOCUS ON HEALTH 
AND IMMIGRATION HOW ARE WE GOING 
TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AND HOW WILL 
WE ENSURE PEOPLE WILL COPE IN A 
VERY VERY DID YOU HAVE TOUGH 
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WITH 
COMPETING WORK AND FAMILY LIFE 
SUPPORTING PEOPLE GETTING ON THE 
HOUSING LADDER CONTINUING TO 
INVEST IN TRANSPORT PEOPLE WILL BE 
CONTRASTING A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WHO 
DOES HAVE THE Y. Z. FOR THE FUTURE 
AGAINST A CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHO 
ALWAYS SEE IT AS A HUGE MARKETING 
EXERCISE AND NO POLICY BEHIND IT 
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A TO TEMIC 
SWING OF HEART IT'S HARD TO BEAT 
NUNEATON THE DISTRICT COUNCIL WAS 
LABOUR SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR LAST NIGHT IT 
SWITCHED TO THE CONSERVATIVES 
MIDTERM BLUES OR A DEEP REVOLT 
AS LABOUR GRASSROOTS COME THEY 
DON'T GET DEEPER THAN THIS LABOUR 
HAS RUN NUNEATON AND BED WORTH 
COUNCIL FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS THE OLD COLD 
MINING CULTURE IS STILL STRONG 
THOUGH MOST OF THE PITS HAVE CLOSED 
AT THIS WORKING MEN'S CLUB THEY 
WOKE UP TO A SHOCK THE COUNCIL 
HAS GONE FORY CRUCIALLY IT WAS THE 
OLD MINING AREAS OF THE BOROUGH 
THAT SWITCHED 
IT IS A WAKE UP CALL 
FOR THE LABOUR PARTY WHY THE 
TRADITIONAL TRADES UNION WORKING 
CLASS HAS SORT OF BEEN LEFT BEHIND 
IT WAS A BIG PART OF THE LABOUR 
VOTE AND I THINK THESE SORT OF 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING SORRY YOU HAVE 
GOT TO PULL YOUR SOCKS UP AND START 
LOOKING AT US AND SUPPORT US A BIT 
GIVE US A BIT OF HELP 
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK THE PROBLEM WAS 
I THINK 
PROBABLY A LACK OF INTEREST FROM 
THE VOTERS THE OTHER THING I 
SUPPOSE LIKE I SAY IT IS A CHANGE 
THEY ARE 
LOOKING AT CHANGE AND LOOKING AT WHATEVER THE POLICIES 
WILL BE GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO SEE 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN 
I'M NOT 
PARTICULARLY HAPPY WITH IT THE THE AVERAGE WAGE HERE IS NINETEEN THOUSAND 
THAT'S FOUR THOUSAND BELOW THE ENGLISH 
AVERAGE CRIME IS HIGH AND PUBLIC 
HEALTH IS AMONG THE WORST IN THE 
COUNTRY UP TO NOW LABOUR'S 
ELECTORAL STRATEGY HAS BEEN FOUNDED 
ON THE CERTAINTY PEOPLE HERE HAVE 
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO BUT LABOUR NOW 
THAT CERTAINTY IS GONE 
I THINK 
THAT'S GOOD L. THINK LABOUR OUGHT 
TO BE OUT WHY DON'T KNOW WHY WHY BUT I JUST THINK IT IS GOOD WHAT WHAT KIND OF AREA IS THIS 
PROBABLY A 
LITTLE BIT WORKING CLASS 
AND WHY 
DO YOU THINK SUDDENLY YOU GET 
WORKING CLASS PEOPLE VOTING 
CONSERVATIVE 
BECAUSE THEY ARE FED CONSERVATIVE UP WITH 
PRICES GOING UP PETROL UP WITH EVERYTHING ELSE EVERYTHING SEEMS 
TO BE GOING UP APART FROM WAGES 
I'M UNEMPLOYED MY MATE JOIN THE 
ARMY AND MY DAD USED TO BE A MINER 
YEARS AGO 
YOU VOTED B. N. P. 
WHY AS 
PROTEST VOTE AGAINST LABOUR WHAT WHAT IS WRONG WITH LABOUR 
THEY HAVE 
FAILED ON EVERYTHING THE POLICIES 
HEALTH SERVICE IMMIGRATION 
EVERYTHING THE AFRPLD FORCES THE 
LOT EVERYTHING 
WHAT COULD THEY DO 
TO GET SOMEBODY LIKE YOU TO COME 
BACK TO THEM 
NOTHING AT ALL 
PEOPLE COMPLAIN AND YET THEY ARE 
OUT OF TOUCH WITH NORMAL PEOPLE 
THEY ARE SO OUT OF TOUCH IT'S 
UNBELIEVABLE I'LL NEVER VOTE FOR 
THEM EVER AGAIN 
THE B. N. P. WON TWO 
SEATS HERE FROM SCRATCH IN FORMER 
MINING AREAS IT CALLS INTO 
QUESTION WHETHER IT'S NATURAL 
LABOUR TERRITORY AT ALL THIS 
RESOLT OF THE HEARTLAND COULD BE 
MORE THAN JUST A SWING IT COULD BE 
A GENERATIONAL CHANGE SO THAT EVEN 
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS BAD MEMORIES 
OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTY'S ARE BLOWN AWAY BY 
BAD FEELINGS ABOUT TODAY THE 
CONSERVATIVE LEADER WHO I CAUGHT UP 
WITH HIS VICTORY VISIT TO NUNEATON 
IS STILL WORKING HARD TO BURY THE 
MEMORIES OF THATCHERISM HERE SOME 
OF THE PLACES HAVE VOTED 
CONSERVATIVE ARE FORMER MINING 
AREAS DO YOU GET A SENSE YOU MIGHT 
HAVE HEALED THE SCARS OF TWENTY THIRTY 
YEARS AGO 
I HOPE SO WHEN YOU COME 
TO AREAS LIKE NUNEATON AND OTHER 
AREAS SOME PEOPLE STILL TALK ABOUT 
THE TIMES L. UNDERSTAND THE PAIN 
AND THE DIFFICULTY THERE WAS L. 
THINK PEOPLE ARE NOW LOOKING 
TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND ASKING WHO 
IS GOING TO KEEP THE COST OF LIVING 
DOWN WHO IS GOING TO HELP WITH THE 
THINGS I CARE ABOUT IN TERMS OF 
THE SCHOOLS I SEND MY 
AND THE N. H. S. HOSPITALS I USE AND 
THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY HAS BEEN 
MAKING INCREASING SENSE ABOUT THE 
NITTY GRITTY AREAS 
DO YOU THINK 
ANY LABOUR AREAS ARE OFF LIMITS NO NO IF HE'S RIGHT THERE COULD BE BIGGER 
SHOCKS 
THERE WOULD MAKE OUR PETER HYMAN 
DANNY FINKELSTEIN OF THE TIMES WHO 
USED TO WORK FOR THE CONSERVATIVES 
AND OLLY GRENDER OR FROM FEED LIB 
DEMS LOVELY E. C. U. ALLBACK WHAT 
DAY TO START A LOVELY TO SEE YOU 
ALL BACK PETER WHAT WAS THIS THE 
DAY THEY LOST THE NEXT ELECTION 
YOU COULD NOT QUITE SAY THAT THAT 
IT 
WAS OBVIOUSLY A BAD RESULT L. WAS TRYING TO THINK WHAT THE SILVER 
LINING IS NORMALLY WHEN YOU ARE 
DOING THIS YOU THINK WELL IS THE 
SHARE OF THE VOTE NOT QUITE WHAT 
THEY NEED BUT FORTY FOUR IS PRETTY GOOD L. 
WAS ALSO LOOKING IN THE NORTH THEY 
ARE BEGINNING TO MAKE INROADS IN 
THE NORTH IN THE END YOU HAVE TO 
SAY IT IS A BAD RESULT IN A WAY 
THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN YOU TURN 
THAT AROUND FROM THE DEPTHS OF 
DESPAIR NOT THE BEGINNING OF 
COMPLETE MELTDOWN THAT IS IN THE 
HANDS OF PARTY BACKBENCHERS AND 
WHETHER THEY STILL HAVE THE HUNGER 
FOR POWER THIS IS A HUGE TEST OF 
CHARACTER NOW IT MAY BE 
IRRECOVERABLE BUT WE DO NOT KNOW 
DANNY IS THIS REAL TORY BREAKTHROUGH 
ABSOLUTELY IT LEAVES BREAKTHROUGH GORDON BROWN WITH TWO OPTIONS TO 
GO OR DO NOTHING THE MIDDLE OPTION 
WHICH IS TO GO ON ABOUT LISTENING 
AND LEARNING AND CHANGING IS 
TOTALLY OUT OF CHARACTER IT 
SOUNDED ODD 
WHY WOULD HE GO L. DO 
I DO NOT THINK HE WILL GO SO WHAT HE 
SHOULD PROBABLY DO IS TO WORK HIS 
WAY THROUGH IT TO BE DETERMINED 
AND DRIVEN AND WHAT HE REALLY IS 
WHICH IS THE CLUNKING FACED AND TO 
HOPE THAT THE ECONOMY COMES RIGHT 
AND HE CAN ASCRIBE IT TO HIS 
COOLNESS AND CALMNESS IN THIS BAD 
PERIOD THAT IS THE ONLY STRATEGY 
HE HAS GOT LEFT THE OTHER STRATEGY 
IS TO LET SOMEONE ELSE DO IT AND AND THEREFORE HE HAS TO MAKE CLEAR 
THAT HE IS RULING OUT A GENERAL 
ELECTION SOON 
A ONCE COULD BE A 
MISFORTUNE TWICE LOOKS LIKE 
CARELESSNESS 
THEREFORE WHAT HE CARELESSNESS ALSO HAS TO DO IS BE PASSIONATE 
ABOUT THE THINGS HE CARES ABOUT 
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS LAST 
TIME ABOUT HOW YOU WANT THE 
CLUNKING FIST BACK WHAT IS 
STRIKING IS PEOPLE WHO ARE SO 
WORRIED ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET 
WHAT IS HIS ANSWER TO THEM THOSE 
ARE SERIOUS MATTERS AND HE IS IN 
HIS COMFORT ZONE WHEN HE TALKS 
ABOUT SERIOUS THINGS HE NEEDS TO 
GET BACK TO THAT RATHER THAN 
FLUFFY STUFF ON A SOFA 
THE LAST 
THING HE NEEDS TO DO IS LISTEN 
POLITICIANS ALWAYS SAY THEY NEED TO 
LISTEN HE NEEDS TO LEAD NOW HE 
NEEDS TO GET BACK TO THE CORE 
CONVICTIONS NOT CALCULATE ABOUT 
HOW THEY PLAY TONY HAD A LOVELY 
PHRASE FOR THIS IN PRIVATE AT A 
SIMILAR LOW POINT WHICH IS THAT 
HE HAS TO GO FOR BUST HE HAS TO DO 
WHAT HE THINKS IS RIGHT FORGET 
ABOUT WHETHER THERE IS AN ELECTION 
JUST DO IT INCREMENTALLY 
BUT WHAT 
IF PEOPLE ARE TELLING HIM THEY DO 
NOT LIKE HIM LEADING THIS DID NOT 
HAPPEN UNDER TONY BLAIR HE HAD THE 
IRAQ WAR ON HIS HAND AND TOP UP THE 
REBELLIONS BUT IT DID NOT GET THIS 
BAD HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE HE WAS 
ABOUT TO LOSE A GENERAL 
ELECTION 
NO BUT I DO NOT THINK IN NINE 
MONTHS SOMEONE WHO WAS ONE OF THE 
MOST RESPECTED CHANCELLOR'S IN 
HISTORY HAS GONE FROM THAT TO 
TERRIBLE POLITICIAN HE HAS MADE 
MISTAKES 
HE WAS A GOOD CHANCELLOR MISTAKES BUT HE HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE 
POLITICIAN 
HE WAS AND IS A SERIOUS POLITICIAN BIG FIGURE HE IS NOT A WEEK 
FEEBLE LEADER AS SOME HAVE SAID 
HE WAS SERIOUS 
THE LIB DEMS ARE IN 
THIS CURIOUS POSITION AT THE MOMENT 
SORT OF TREADING WATER YOU HAVE 
DONE O. K. BUT YOU HAVE KIND OF LOST 
YOUR CAUSE NOW IF YOU WERE ONCE 
THE PROTEST VOTE TAKING LABOUR 
VOTERS WHO DID NOT LIKE THE IRAQ 
WAR THAT HAS GONE AWAY NOW WHAT 
IS YOUR BEAST NOW 
IF THE LABOUR 
PARTY HAVE ABANDONED POVERTY AS 
PERCEIVED BY PEOPLE OUT THERE 
THEREIN LIES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE 
LIB DEMS AND THE LIB DEMS ARE NOT 
DOING THAT IT BELIES THEIR PRIVATE 
FEARS THERE WILL BE A QUIET SIGH 
OF RELIEF BECAUSE THE CAMERAS WILL 
BE VERY MUCH OF THE LIB DEMS NOW 
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS IF NOT WEEKS 
OR MONTHS 
WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE IN 
COALITION WITH IN THE NEXT 
PARLIAMENT 
BRIAN PADDICK SUGGESTED PARLIAMENT A INZY GERMAN OF THE STOP THE WAR 
COALITION 
THAT IS NOT A CONSENSUS COALITION VIEW IN THE PARTY 
WE ARE ALL 
TALKING ABOUT THIS MELTDOWN IF YOU 
STEP BACK AND SAY WHAT WILL CHANGE 
AS A RESULT THERE WILL NOT BE A 
GENERAL ELECTION AND HE WILL NOT 
QUIT BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE ANOTHER 
NON ELECTED P. M. NOTHING ACTUALLY 
CHANGES 
THERE ARE RULES FOR THE CHANGES CONSERVATIVES TO 
THINK ABOUT L. THINK THIS IS MAINLY A PROTEST VOTE 
AGAINST LABOUR THE CONSERVATIVES 
STILL HAVE A LOT OF CONVINCING TO 
DO THERE WILL BE A LOT OF SCRUTINY 
OF DAVE CAMERON IN THE NEXT TWO 
YEARS 
SO IN A SENSE YOU ARE RIGHT YEARS THE PRESSURE WILL BE OF NICK CLEGG 
BUT IT WILL ALSO BE ON DAVID 
CAMERON IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
MAINTAIN THAT MOMENTUM SO AT THE 
SAME TIME AS THEY SHOULD CELEBRATE 
THOSE RESULTS THERE IS A SENSE OF 
CHALLENGE 
WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT CHALLENGE MOMENTUM AND IT DOES MATTER 
PEOPLE START PEELING AWAY FROM THE 
PARTY THEY THINK MIGHT LOSE AND 
START GOING TO WHERE THE POWER LIES 
I DO NOT MEAN POLITICIANS NECESSARY 
JUST THAT MAINSTREAM OPINION IN 
THIS COUNTRY STARTS TO LOOK TO WHO 
MIGHT WIN AND THAT CAN SNOWBALL 
WHICH IS WHY GORDON BROWN SHOULD 
GET BACK TO HIS PASSIONS AND THE 
BIGGER PICTURE RATHER THAN FORTY TWO DAYS 
CANNABIS PRISON PAY THESE THINGS 
DO NOT DIRECTLY TALK TO PEOPLE HE HE IS A GOOD MINISTER AND A BAD 
POLITICIAN AS PETER SAID 
WE WILL 
END IT THERE
