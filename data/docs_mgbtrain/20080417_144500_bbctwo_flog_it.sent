WELL YOU'RE TOTALLY WRONG IT WAS IN NEWCASTLE AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY WELCOME TO FLOG IT 
NEWCASTLE AND THE NORTHEAST ONCE MEANT MINING AND SHIPBUILDING 
BUT TIMES HAVE CHANGED AND NOW IT'S A LIVELY MODERN CITY 
KNOWN BETTER FOR THE ARTS AND ITS LEISURE FACILITIES 
THE METRO RADIO ARENA WAS MODELLED ON MADISON SQUARE GARDENS IN NEW YORK 
AND IT'S A STUNNING VENUE 
AND I BET THE NOISE IS DEAFENING WHEN THERE'S A CAPACITY CROWD 
IT WAS CONCEIVED BY LOCAL LAD CHAS CHANDLER OF THE ANIMALS 
AND ON ITS OPENING NIGHT IT BROUGHT DAVID BOWIE TO NEWCASTLE 
BUT TODAY FLOG IT IS TOP OF THE BILL 
THE CENTRE IS FILLING UP EVERYBODY IS UNPACKING THEIR BAGS AND BOXES 
SEARCHING FOR THE BIG NAMES IN THE COLLECTIBLES TODAY 
ARE EXPERTS KATE BLISS AND ANITA MANNING 
IT SEEMS FUNNY TO GET EXCITED ABOUT A PAIR OF BOOK ENDS 
BUT I THINK THEY'RE LOVELY 
THEY CAME FROM SOUTHALL NEAR NOTTINGHAM RIGHT 
MY DAUGHTER SHE USED TO BE IN RATHER A POSH SCHOOL RIGHT 
WE HAD THIS GARDEN PARTY THESE WERE ON THE WHITE ELEPHANT STALL 
BEFORE THEY SAID I DECLARE THIS GARDEN PARTY OPEN I WAS READY I SAW THEY WERE ASPREY OF LONDON 
I THOUGHT I'LL HAVE THEM THEY WERE FIFTY P. FIFTY P. FIFTY P. 
HOW LONG AGO WAS THAT ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO 
SO YOUR DAUGHTER HAS LONG LEFT THE SCHOOL YES 
SO AS SOON AS THE FETE WAS OPENED YOU WERE THERE DASHED STRAIGHT IN 
WHAT A BARGAIN PAM I THINK THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY SUPER GOOD 
WE'VE GOT THE ASPREY'S NAME ON THE BOTTOM RETAILED BY ASPREY AND AMP CO LIMITED LONDON 
A BOND STREET NAME LIKE THAT IS SO WELL KNOWN IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO ADD A PREMIUM 
AND FOR THESE IT SHOWS THE QUALITY THEY ARE BEAUTIFULLY MADE 
THEY ARE COURSE LEATHER AND THEY FEEL SO NICE 
THEY FEEL ABSOLUTELY LOVELY 
BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE INSIDE WE CAN SEE ORIGINALLY THEY WERE THAT BEAUTIFUL DARK GREEN REALLY NICE 
REGENCY GREEN REALLY 
THAT'S THE STYLE I'D CALL THEM REGENCY STYLE 
WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL GENEROUS CLASSICAL SCROLL 
AND THEN THIS LOVELY GILT TOOLED RUNNING BORDER FLORAL LEAFAGE BORDER ALL AROUND THE SCROLLS 
A JOY IN ANY STUDY WOULDN'T THEY BE YES HOW OLD DO YOU THINK THEY ARE 
I THINK THEY PROBABLY DATE FROM ABOUT NINETEEN TEN NINETEEN TWENTY REALLY YES 
CERTAINLY EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY I'D SAY 
THE DETAIL IS JUST LOVELY EVEN TO THESE LITTLE BORDERS 
THEY'VE BEEN FINISHED OFF BEAUTIFULLY 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL THEM WHAT MADE YOU BRING THEM ALONG TODAY I DON'T KNOW REALLY 
I'M NOT SURE YOU DO WANT TO SELL THEM I PICKED THEM UP AND THOUGHT I'LL TAKE THEM 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHAT ABOUT VALUE ANY IDEAS 
NO NONE AT ALL YOU PAID FIFTY P. I PAID FIFTY P. 
I THINK THEY'RE SUPER QUALITY ALSO VERY USEFUL ITEMS VERY FUNCTIONAL 
I THINK SOMEBODY COULD PAY ONE HUNDRED FOR THESE 
REALLY HMM 
I'D LIKE TO PUT AN ESTIMATE OF SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED AN AUCTION ESTIMATE 
BUT I'D PAY THAT FOR THEM EASILY I CAN SEE SOMEONE ELSE PAYING MORE 
I THINK THEY'LL GO PRETTY WELL FOR YOU 
A VERY GOOD BUY ALL THAT TIME AGO 
IT'LL GO TOWARDS MY POCKET MONEY FOR MY HOLIDAY IN CAPE TOWN CAPE TOWN LOVELY 
CATHERINE THIS CERTAINLY ISN'T A BABY DOLL NO SHE'S QUITE BIG 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST DOLLS I'VE SEEN FOR A WEE WHILE RIGHT 
SHE'S LOVELY 
SHE'S A GERMAN DOLL MADE BY ARMAND MARSEILLE 
THIS FACTORY STARTED IN GERMANY IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN 
THIS IS A LATER DOLL 
WHERE DID YOU GET HER I KNOW THAT SHE WAS BOUGHT IN NINETEEN THIRTY 
FOR AN AUNT OF MINE AND SHE WAS BOUGHT IN A TRADE FAIR IN THE MIDLANDS 
BUT APART FROM THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT 
HOW DID YOU COME BY HER 
WELL THIS AUNTIE DIED LAST YEAR AND I INHERITED 
YOU BECAME HER ADOPTIVE MOTHER 
YES YES 
WHERE DID SHE STAY IN YOUR HOUSE DID SHE GET A ROOM OF HER OWN 
WELL SHE'S IN THE BEDROOM BUT NOT MY BEDROOM 
SHE'S A BIG GIRL 
BUT SHE'S QUITE AN INTERESTING GIRL 
HER COMPOSITION BODY ALL THE LIMBS ARE JOINTED WHICH IS GOOD 
WRISTS ELBOW SHOULDERS AND THIGHS 
SHE HAS THIS WONDERFUL COLOUR BLUE IN HER EYES WHICH IS GOOD 
AND AN OPEN MOUTH WITH THESE DAINTY WHITE TEETH 
SO IF WE TURN HER ROUND WE CAN SEE THE MARKINGS OF ARMAND MARSEILLE 
ON THE BACK WE HAVE A. M. 
AND WE ALSO HAVE THREE HUNDRED NINETY THE NUMBER THREE HUNDRED NINETY WHICH IS THE HEAD MOULD 
SHE'S ALL THERE AND I'D SAY IN GOOD CONDITION 
HER HAIR IS A BIT STRAGGLY IT IS A BIT 
I THINK IT'S THE ORIGINAL HAIR 
IT'S A BIT FLY AWAY 
SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE'S BEEN DRAGGED THROUGH A HEDGE BACKWARDS 
I KNOW SHE'S GOT A WISTFUL EXPRESSION 
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING QUITE SWEET ABOUT IT I KNOW 
YOU WANT TO LOOK AFTER HER 
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK AFTER HER 
NO SHE'S TOO BIG YOU WANT TO FLOG HER PRICE WISE 
I'D SAY BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO SELL HER AT THAT PRICE 
YES I WOULD 
I THINK WE'LL PUT HER INTO AUCTION AND PERHAPS A RESERVE OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY WOULD YOU FEEL HAPPY WITH THAT CATHERINE 
YES I WOULD THAT'S FINE TELL ME DOES SHE HAVE A NAME 
NO SHE NEVER HAD A NAME 
POOR WEE SOUL 
NEVER EVER HAD A NAME WHICH IS STRANGE BUT SHE WAS NEVER CALLED 
MAYBE HER NEXT OWNER WILL GIVE HER A NAME AFTER ALL THESE YEARS I HOPE SO DEFINITELY 
SOMETHING HAS JUST CAUGHT MY EYE AND IT'S HERE 
WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR THAT ODD CURIO AND I THINK I'VE FOUND ONE TODAY HELLO WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
ALISON MAY I MOVE YOUR HANDBAG AND SIT NEXT TO YOU 
NOW WOW IS IT AN EARLY BINGO MACHINE CAN I PLAY WITH IT 
YEAH AND ALL THESE LITTLE BALLS ARE MARKED 
TELL ME THE STORY WELL MY UNCLE HAD A PUB AND IT WAS USED AS A BINGO MACHINE 
AND THEN WE WENT TO BEAMISH FOR THE DAY AND APPARENTLY THE NUMBER ON THE BALL IS THE PITMAN'S NUMBER 
AND WHEN THEY SANK A NEW SHAFT IF IT WAS DANGEROUS THE BALL DROPPED OUT AND HE WOULD OPEN THE SEAM 
SO IT'S A BIT LIKE DRAWING THE SHORT STRAW 
YOU TURN THE HANDLE LIKE THAT 
AND THE DUST COMES OUT 
WELL I CAN SEE WHERE THE BALL COMES OUT HERE WHICH IS SPRING LOADED 
AND THEN IT DROPS INTO THE TRAY AT THE BOTTOM 
THIS IS A HARD THING TO VALUE BECAUSE IT DOES BELONG TO A BYGONE MUSEUM 
I'VE NOT SEEN ONE FOR SALE BEFORE AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE IN MY LIFE 
BEFORE BUT I'D LOVE TO SEE THIS GET AROUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE BUT 
I BET AN AUCTIONEER WOULD COME ALONG AND SAY WHAT'S THE USE OF IT 
VERY HARD TO SELL HE'LL PROBABLY PUT HIS CLICHE EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ON IT BUT IT MIGHT FIND THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MARK 
A LOT OF WORK HAS GONE INTO THAT 
IT'S BEEN MADE BY AN ENGINEER AND IT'S BUILT TO LAST 
IT DOES TAKE A LOT OF ABUSE 
I THINK IT'S A PIECE OF A FUNCTIONAL SCULPTURE I LOVE ORBS 
I LOVE ROUND THINGS AND GLOBES 
THAT TO ME HAS GOT THE LOOK 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL IT 
WELL I'VE GOT A BIG SINGER SEWING MACHINE 
AND IT SITS UNDERNEATH THE SINGER ON THE TREADLE OF THE OLD SINGER 
IT'S ON DISPLAY THEN IT'S ON DISPLAY BUT IT GATHERS DUST 
AND I THINK IT'S BEEN THERE TOO LONG 
I DON'T MIND PUTTING IT INTO AUCTION WITH THE EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY AND I'D LIKE TO SEE IT DO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
GOOD GRIEF SHALL WE 
GO ON THEN GO FOR IT 
AND I'LL PROBABLY NEVER SEE ONE IN MY LIFE AGAIN 
I DON'T WANT TO SELL IT NOW 
I DO I DO 
THIS STOOD OUT AMONG ALL THE TEA SETS IN THE QUEUE I WAS LOOKING AT 
WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO BRING IT ALONG TODAY 
I BOUGHT A PICTURE I'VE HAD IT ABOUT THREE YEARS AND I SAW A MOTH 
GO IN THE BACK SO I OPENED IT AND I CAME ACROSS THE PICTURE 
YOU CAME ACROSS THIS AT THE BACK OF THE PICTURE YOU BOUGHT 
SO DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU GOT IT NO I DIDN'T KNOW AT ALL 
AND WHERE DID YOU GET THE ORIGINAL PICTURE FROM 
I GOT IT DOWN AT CLITHEROE AT AN AUCTION HOUSE 
AT AN AUCTION AND WHAT WAS THAT OF 
A SHIRE PICTURE BUT IT WAS A TEA TOWEL 
SO WHAT DID YOU PAY FOR THE PICTURE OF THE SHIRE HORSE 
TWELVE 
WELL NOT BAD HAVING THAT STUCK ON THE BACK AS WELL 
HAVE YOU TRIED TO DO ANY RESEARCH OR ANYTHING 
NO I JUST SAW FLOG IT ADVERTISED IN THE PAPER AND I THOUGHT I'D COME ALONG AND SEE WHAT IT WAS WORTH 
IF IT WAS WORTH ANYTHING AT ALL 
O. K. LET'S HAVE A CLOSER LOOK 
THIS IS AN ORIGINAL GOUACHE PICTURE 
GOUACHE AND PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT OF WATERCOLOUR 
YOU CAN SEE IT'S A REALLY VIBRANT BATTLE SCENE ISN'T IT 
IT'S SIGNED DOWN IN THE BOTTOM LEFT HAND CORNER 
WE'VE GOT A SIGNATURE FOR MORTELMANS SEVENTY THREE 
HE'S IN FACT A TWENTIETH CENTURY ARTIST AND IT'S A BATTLE SCENE BUT WE'VE GOT 
IT TITLED ON THE BACK IT'S PRINTED AT THEM WITH A BAYONET 
I SEE WE'VE GOT SOME NOTES IN THE MARGIN 
WORCESTER'S IN BRACKETS WHICH IS THE BATTALION AT PEROZESHAH IT LOOKS LIKE 
THE SETTING IS IN INDIA WITH THESE GENTLEMEN IN TURBANS FIGHTING DO YOU LIKE IT 
YES BUT IT DOESN'T APPEAL TO ME BECAUSE OF THE FIGHTING 
IT'S A BIT GRUESOME 
WE'VE SOMEBODY HERE 
AT DEATH'S DOOR THE BAYONET ABOUT TO PUNCTURE HIM 
IN FACT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE IMPORTANT ABOUT IT 
IT'S FOR A BOOK ILLUSTRATION I BELIEVE 
MORTELMANS DID VARIOUS ILLUSTRATIONS SEVERAL NOVELS BY P. G. WODEHOUSE 
THERE ARE NOTED A COUPLE OF BATTLE SCENES THAT HAVE COME UP FOR AUCTION 
SO WHAT ABOUT PRICE WHAT SORT OF VALUE DO YOU THINK WOULD GO ON THAT 
I WOULDN'T KNOW 
I THINK AT AUCTION HIS PRICES DO VARY 
AND I THINK ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S FOR A BOOK ILLUSTRATION IT MAKES IT LESS COMMERCIAL 
I'D LIKE TO PUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ON IT 
HOW DOES THAT SOUND TO YOU FINE 
ARE YOU HAPPY TO SELL IT AT THAT YEAH 
IT'S NOT BAD CONSIDERING YOU PAID TWELVE AND GOT TWO PICTURES FOR THAT PRICE 
VERY NICE THAT'S LOVELY WE'LL PUT IT IN WITH THAT ESTIMATE 
AND I HOPE WE GET A GOOD PRICE FOR YOU THANK YOU 
WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING FLAT OUT 
IT'S HALFWAY THROUGH OUR DAY WHICH MEANS IT'S OUR FIRST TRIP 
TO THE AUCTION ROOM ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING PARTS OF THE SHOW 
LET'S HOPE WE HIT THE TOP END OF OUR EXPERTS' VALUATIONS 
FINGERS CROSSED FOR OUR OWNERS 
BEFORE WE GO TO THE AUCTION HERE IS A QUICK RECAP 
I LOVED THESE LEATHER BOOKENDS 
THEY SHOULD GO FAR 
THE GERMAN DOLL IS LOOKING FOR A NEW OWNER WHO WILL GIVE HER A NAME HOPEFULLY 
AND I FOUND THIS MACHINE AND I HOPE IT'S NUMBER COMES UP 
AS SHOULD THE PAINTING WHICH WAS REVEALED BY A MOTH 
TODAY'S SALE COMES FROM THE BOLDON AUCTION GALLERIES AND TODAY'S AUCTIONEER IS GILES HODGES 
THEY'VE GOT TO BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT THEY'RE ABOUT TO CELEBRATE TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN BUSINESS

I'M NOW HEADING BACK TO NEWCASTLE TO MEET A DURHAM ARTIST 
WHO DREW MUCH OF HIS INSPIRATION FROM SPENNYMOOR A LOCAL MINING TOWN 
NORMAN CORNISH EXHIBITS AND SELLS HIS WORK HERE 
AT NORTHUMBRIA UNIVERSITY GALLERY AND HE'S BEEN A PROFESSIONAL ARTIST FOR FORTY YEARS NOW 
BUT WAY BACK IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN HE STARTED OUT HIS WORKING LIFE 
DOWN A PIT AND THE COLLIERY WAS NICKNAMED THE BUTCHER'S SHOP 
AND WE CAN ALL IMAGINE HOW TOUGH CONDITIONS WERE DOWN THE MINES 
A LIFE WHERE BOYS WERE QUICKLY MADE INTO MEN 
YOU ALWAYS HAD THE FEELING THAT IF YOU'VE GOT AN ABILITY TO DRAW 
AND A DESIRE TO DO SO YOU THINK OH WHY CAN'T I USE THIS 
RATHER THAN GO ROUND WITH A PICK AND SHOVEL AND WORK WITH THAT 
LET'S REMEMBER THIS THE PICK AND SHOVEL BUSINESS THE PIT IF YOU LIKE 
IT WAS A KIND A ROUGH KIND BUT A KIND OF ART SCHOOL IN ITSELF 
NORMAN IT SOUNDS PRETTY GRIM 
I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD HAVE COPED AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN WORKING DOWN A PIT 
WHAT WAS IT LIKE AND HOW LONG WERE YOU A MINER FOR 
THIRTY TWO AND A HALF YEARS ACTUALLY 
THAT'S HARD GRAFT 
WELL IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE YOU GET USED TO IT 
THE FIRST SHIFT STARTS AT ABOUT HALF PAST THREE IN THE MORNING AND YOU GET USED TO THAT AS WELL 
I'VE GOT TO SAY YOUR WORK IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IN YOUR MIND WHEN YOU'RE PAINTING THIS 
WELL IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU THAT I WAS JUST FOURTEEN 
AND I HAD STARTED WORK AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT SOUNDS LIKE A STORY WRITTEN BY ONE OF THESE ROMANTIC 
WRITERS BUT IT'S GOSPEL TRUTH THE FIRST THING I HAD TO GO THROUGH WAS A BIG LONG TUNNEL UNDER THE RAILWAY 
IT WAS PITCH BLACK AND WHEN I GOT THE OTHER END IT WAS FINE AND IT STARTED TO SNOW AND BLIZZARD 
AND I WAS DELIGHTED BECAUSE IT LIGHTENED EVERYTHING UP 
HOWEVER I WALKED TO THE MINE THAT'S WHAT I SAW THAT'S WHAT IT WAS 
IT WAS THIS GREAT GANTRY AND THERE WAS MEN AND IT WAS ALL VERY STRANGE AND ALL VERY MYSTERIOUS 
AND THERE WAS ALL THESE STEEL ROPES AND STEEL HANDRAILS AND STEEL THINGS 
THE MEN WERE GOING UP WITH OIL LAMPS AND AS THEY WALKED THEY WERE GOING 
WITH ALL THESE LIGHTS LIKE THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE A LOAD OF FIREFLIES 
AND I THOUGHT MY GOD IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG STEEL SPIDER'S WEB THAT HAS GOT THEM 
HAS CAPTURED THEM IS GOING TO LOAD THEM DOWN THIS BIG HOLE INTO THE PIT 
THAT'S THAT PICTURE 
WOULD YOU SAY YOU HAD ANY INFLUENCES THEN ANY FAMOUS MASTERS OR CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS AROUND YOU 
WELL I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT PAINTING AND I WASN'T PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN PAINTING IN THAT SENSE 
BUT I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN DRAWING 
HOWEVER WHEN I STARTED WORK I WAS VERY VERY FORTUNATE 
BECAUSE I SAW A POSTER ADVERTISING AN EXHIBITION 
OF WORK BY THE SPENNYMOOR SETTLEMENT SKETCHING CLUB 
MARVELLOUS I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD ONE 
SO I WENT STRAIGHT AWAY TO THE EXHIBITION 
WONDERFUL I THOUGHT I WAS IN HEAVEN YOU KNOW 
NORMAN JOINED THE SKETCHING CLUB AND IT GAVE HIM THE CONFIDENCE TO PAINT THE PEOPLE AND THE PLACES HE KNEW 
AND IT CHANGED THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE 
HOW CAN ONE PAINT ABOUT 
LIFE IF WE DON'T LIVE 
YOU SEE WE MUST HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT WHICH TO PAINT 
AND IF WE WANT TO PAINT ABOUT LIFE IF WE WANT TO SNATCH 
LITTLE PIECES OF LIFE AS THEY HAPPEN 
THEY'RE HAPPENING ALL THE TIME IN THE MAINSTREAM OF THE WORLD 
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU'RE AT PROVIDED IT'S A SINCERE JOB OF WORK WHICH IS BEING 
SINCERELY DONE LIFE IS HAPPENING THERE 
WHEN DID YOU ACTUALLY REALISE YOU COULD LEAVE THE MINE AND WORK AS AN ARTIST 
WELL YOU SEE FOR TWENTY YEARS WORKING IN THE MINES I ALSO WAS 
PAINTING AND EXHIBITING WORK FROM TIME TO TIME AND SELLING WORK 
INDEED SOMETIMES I MADE FAR MORE AS AN ARTIST THAN AS A MINER 
NOT TOO OFTEN BUT SOMETIMES 
NORMAN'S PAINTINGS ARE A POWERFUL RECORD OF AN INDUSTRY AND A WAY OF LIFE THAT ARE NO MORE 
YOU PAINTED A LOT OF YOUR FELLOW COLLEAGUES IN THE PUBS AND ON THE WAY TO WORK AND DOWN THE MINE 
WHAT DID THEY THINK OF YOUR WORK 
WELL THEY WERE WONDERFUL BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T BOTHER ME 
WHEN I WENT INTO LOVELY PUBS 
AND I DISCOVERED THAT LOCAL PUBS OR ANY PUB 
MORE SO THEN THAN NOW ACTUALLY WAS A WONDERFUL PLACE TO DRAW 
THERE WAS MEN JUST BEING THEMSELVES 
THERE WEREN'T TRYING TO BE CARY GRANT OR JOHN WAYNE THEY WERE BEING 
JOE AND HARRY AND TOM YOU KNOW WONDERFUL 
DO YOU THINK TO BE A SUCCESSFUL ARTIST YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE MORE 
THAN JUST THE ABILITY TO DRAW OR PAINT WELL 
IF YOU CAN DRAW VERY WELL AND IF YOU CAN WORK HARD AND YOU CAN 
PAINT VERY WELL THAT'S VERY USEFUL BUT IT'S NO GOOD AT ALL IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE OTHER INGREDIENT 
AND THAT IS TO HAVE THE KIND OF BRAIN WHICH THINKS AND FEELS INTENSELY 
IT FEELS ENOUGH TO WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE FEEL ABOUT THE THING 
NORMAN YOU'RE NOW EIGHTY SIX 
I MUST SAY YOU DON'T LOOK IT YOU LOOK REALLY YOUNG BUT ARE YOU STILL PAINTING YES WELL YOU DON'T STOP 
IF YOU'RE A WRITER 
ACTOR A PAINTER I RECKON YOU GO ON UNTIL YOU CAN'T GO ON ANY LONGER 
YOU DON'T JUST STOP 
IT'S A BIT LIKE BREATHING 
NORMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING TIME OUT TO TALK TO US 
IT REALLY HAS BEEN A PLEASURE TALKING TO YOU 
YOU'VE CERTAINLY HAD A LIFE OF TWO HALVES AND A GREAT ONE BY THE SOUNDS OF IT 
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT TO ME IT'S JUST LIFE 
NOW BACK TO THE VALUATION DAY WHERE ANITA HAS FOUND A LITTLE BOX OF DELIGHTS 
TRICIA WHAT A LOVELY LITTLE SET OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 
LET'S HAVE LOOK IN THE BOX 
BEAUTIFUL BOX BY THE WAY LITTLE LEATHER BOUND BOX AND IF WE OPEN IT UP 
WE HAVE THIS DELIGHTFUL LITTLE SET OF SIX VOLUMES AND IT'S THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 
I ALWAYS SAY TO PEOPLE TODAY CONDITION IS SO IMPORTANT 
AND THESE LITTLE BOOKS ARE 
THANK YOU LET'S TAKE ONE OUT AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
AGAIN LEATHER BOUND WITH THE GILT TITLES OF THE PLAYS 
ON THE FRONT HERE AND VERY NICE GILT FLOWERY DECORATION ON THE SPINE 
AND LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE INSIDE COVER HERE 
WHAT WE HAVE IS THE BIJOU SHAKESPEARE 
I THINK THAT'S A LOVELY NAME THE BIJOU SHAKESPEARE 
THE WEE BOOKS THE WEE BOOKS AS WE WOULD CALL IT IN SCOTLAND THE WEE BOOKS 
NOW THESE LITTLE BOOKS ARE ILLUSTRATED TRICIA WHICH IS ALWAYS BETTER RIGHT 
HOWEVER THESE AREN'T LITHOGRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS THEY'RE PHOTOGRAPHIC 
WHICH ARE USUALLY NOT AS GOOD BUT 
WHAT THESE PICTURES ARE OF IS FAMOUS ACTORS AND ACTRESSES OF THE DAY 
AND I THINK THAT ADDS TO THE CHARM AND COLLECTABILITY OF THEM 
IF WE LOOK AT THIS ONE WE HAVE ELLEN TERRY 
OF THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS 
AND THERE SHE IS AS VIOLA IN TWELFTH NIGHT 
AND FOR ME I THINK THAT GIVES ADDED INTEREST YEAH 
SO WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL THEM TRICIA 
MY MOTHER IN LAW'S OBVIOUSLY PUT THEM IN THE CUPBOARD AND THEY'VE BEEN FORGOTTEN ABOUT 
AND IT'S A SHAME TO LEAVE THEM THERE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MY SON DOESN'T READ THEM 
RIGHT IS HE NOT INTO SHAKESPEARE 
HE'S MORE INTO HARRY POTTER AND HORRID HENRY BOOKS THAN SHAKESPEARE 
THESE ARE THINGS OF THE DAY MAYBE HE'LL COME ROUND TO SHAKESPEARE IN TIME HOPEFULLY ONE DAY 
NOW TRICIA THIS TYPE OF ITEM IS QUITE DESIRABLE BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETE 
AND IT'S IN A NICE LITTLE BOX AND IT'S IN GOOD CONDITION 
RIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO PUT AN ESTIMATE OF PERHAPS TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE 
THIRTY TO FORTY IN THAT REGION AND HOPE 
YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE WILL GO A LITTLE FURTHER THAN THAT I DON'T THINK WE CAN GO TOO HIGH 
THAT'S FINE WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO SELL IT WITHIN THAT ESTIMATE YES 
LET'S PUT IT IN TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE WITH A RESERVE OF PERHAPS TWENTY 
THAT'S FINE YES 
NOT A LOT OF MONEY BUT IT'LL GO TO SOMEONE WHO'LL ENJOY IT 
EXACTLY SOMEBODY MIGHT GET PLEASURE 
THAT'S ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS 
LET'S PUT IT TO AUCTION LET'S FLOG IT EXACTLY 
THE FIRST THING I'D LIKE TO SEE IS IT'S GREAT TO HAVE A PAIR 
PAIRS ALWAYS SELL BETTER THAN SINGLE ITEMS 
AND WITH THESE PARTICULAR VASES THEY'RE IN REALLY GOOD CONDITION 
YES SO YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY LOOKED AFTER THEM VERY WELL JUST LEAVING THEM THERE I THINK 
HAD TO GIVE THEM A GOOD WASH LAST NIGHT 
DID YOU THEY'VE COME UP WELL 
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THEM WHERE HAVE THEY COME FROM 
I INHERITED THEM FROM MY FATHER WELL FROM MY PARENTS OBVIOUSLY 
WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT THEM ALONG I WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THEM 
I MEAN THE DATE ON THE BOTTOM 
I'VE LOOKED AND IT'S ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO YOU HAD A GOOD LOOK THEN 
THEY'RE IN REMARKABLE CONDITION FOR 
FOR SOMETHING THAT OLD WELL YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
YOU'VE HAD A GOOD LOOK OBVIOUSLY 
WE'VE GOT THE DATE THERE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO WHICH IS EXACTLY WHEN 
THEY WERE MANUFACTURED SO WE CAN PINPOINT THEM EXACTLY 
THEY'RE VERY LATE VICTORIAN AND TYPICALLY DESIGNED FOR THAT PERIOD 
DOULTON LAMBETH PRODUCED THEM BUT THE OTHER WORD HERE 
INCORPORATED IN THIS STAMP IS FAIENCE AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS 
NO 
IT WAS REALLY THE NAME GIVEN TO A RANGE THAT DOULTON PRODUCED 
IN THAT PERIOD AND THIS FAIENCE RANGE IS RATHER LIKE DELFT POTTERY 
IT'S AN EARTHENWARE BODY AS OPPOSED TO STONEWARE SO A LOT LIGHTER AND THEN IT HAS A TIN GLAZE 
WHICH THEN GIVES AN OPAQUE EFFECT WHICH IS THEN PRINTED OR PAINTED OVER 
SO INSTEAD OF A STONEWARE RANGE WHICH COULD HAVE A THREE DIMENSIONAL MOULDED EFFECT WITH MOULDED MOTIFS 
IN RELIEF OR IMPRESSED THIS HAS A VERY SMOOTH TEXTURE TO IT 
AND THE TIN GLAZE PROVIDES THAT VERY SMOOTH SURFACE ON WHICH TO PRINT AND PAINT 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE DECORATION ON THEM 
IT'S ALL RIGHT IT'S ALL RIGHT 
SHE SAYS IT'S ALL RIGHT WELL IT'S VERY VICTORIAN ISN'T IT 
ISN'T IT YES NOT PARTICULARLY FASHIONABLE TODAY 
AND THE WAY IT'S BEEN DONE IS WHAT WE CALL PRINTED PAINTED DECORATION 
SO THE OUTLINE IS PRINTED ON WITH A TRANSFER 
AND THEN SOMEBODY'S ACTUALLY HAND DECORATED IT OVER THE TOP 
SO ARE PARTICULARLY ON THESE GREEN GROUND PANELS HERE THE FLOWERS HAVE 
BEEN OVER PAINTED BY HAND IN THE DIFFERENT COLOURS 
BUT THE ACTUAL BASIC DESIGN IS PRINTED ON FIRST TO GIVE IT A SORT OF OUTLINE SO WHAT ABOUT VALUE 
ANY IDEAS AT ALL ABSOLUTELY NONE HAVE YOU EVER HAD THEM VALUED BEFORE 
NO NO 
WELL I THINK CONSERVATIVELY SPEAKING 
WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED AT AUCTION 
BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED ACTUALLY IF THEY MADE THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED 
RIGHT SO I WOULD SUGGEST WE PUT A SORT OF COME AND BUY ME ESTIMATE OF TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED O. K. 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY WITH THAT YES 
YOU JUST WANT TO GET THEM GONE NOW DON'T YOU 
I HAVEN'T TALKED YOU INTO KEEPING THEM 
I ONLY BROUGHT ONE BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD 
BE INTERESTED AND I DIDN'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD BUY THEM 
THEN WE SENT YOU HOME TO GET THE OTHER ONE YES 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MAKING TWO TRIPS FOR US TODAY BUT I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT'S WORTH IT 
O. K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
RICHARD DO YOU AND YOUR WIFE HAVE A NICE WEE CUP OF TEA FROM THIS SET IN THE MORNING 
NO WE DON'T USE THIS SET YOU DON'T USE IT WHERE DO YOU KEEP IT 
IN THE CABINET IN THE KITCHEN

SHELLY UH HUH NOW SHELLY WAS ONE OF THE GOOD FACTORIES 
IT WAS ONE OF THE STOKE FACTORIES AND THEY MADE VERY NICE CHINA PARTICULARLY TEA CHINA 
THE THING THAT MAKES THIS SO WONDERFUL IS THE DESIGN 
IT'S WHAT WE CALL ART DECO AND IT WAS MADE IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
THIS IS A VERY STYLISH LITTLE SET 
IF YOU LOOK ON THE INSIDE OF THE CUP WE HAVE THESE RECTANGLES SQUARES OBLONGS AND SO ON 
NOW THIS WAS VERY TYPICAL OF THE ART DECO PERIOD 
WHERE THEY LIKED ANGULAR ITEMS AND THESE HANDLES ARE JUST WONDERFUL 
SO THIS IS HOT AND IT WILL BE WELL FANCIED 
ONE OR TWO WEE THINGS AGAINST IT OR NOT IN ITS FAVOUR 
WE HAVE A CRACK IN ONE OF THE CUPS 
IT'S A PITY BUT THESE THINGS HAPPEN OVER THE YEARS

PRICEWISE ON IT I TEND TO ESTIMATE CONSERVATIVELY BECAUSE
