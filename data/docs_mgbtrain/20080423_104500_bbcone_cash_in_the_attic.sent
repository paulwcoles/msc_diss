WELCOME TO CASH IN THE ATTIC 
THE SHOW THAT FINDS YOUR HIDDEN TREASURES AND HELPS SELL THEM AT AUCTION 
WELCOME TOO TO SIDMOUTH IN DEVON 
THIS BEAUTIFUL BEACH FRONT FORMS PART OF THE JURASSIC COAST 
ENGLAND'S FIRST NATURAL WORLD HERITAGE SITE 
AND HIDDEN IN NINETY FIVE MILES OF CLIFFS 
ARE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION YEARS OF THE EARTH'S HISTORY 
BUT THE DISCOVERY OF MANY OF THESE FOSSILS OWES A LOT TO ONE WOMAN 
MARY ANNING WAS BORN IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY NINE JUST DOWN THE COAST AT LYME REGIS 
AT A TIME WHEN WOMEN WERE SUPPOSED TO STAY HOME 
MARY EMERGED AS A PIONEER OF THE NEW SCIENCE OF PALEONTOLGY 
MARY'S FINDS WERE DONATED TO THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM IN LONDON 
ON DISPLAY TO THIS DAY 
LET'S HOPE WE CAN CARRY ON HER WORK AND UNEARTH SOME TREASURES 
OF OUR OWN AS WE GO IN SEARCH OF ITEMS TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
COMING UP ON TODAY'S CASH IN THE ATTIC 
COULD THIS BE MY TOUGHEST ASSIGNMENT YET 
JAMES ARE YOU TAKING TIME OUT OR WORKING 
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW 
WILL THE CORKS BE POPPING EVEN BEFORE WE KNOW OUR GRAND TOTAL 
I HEARD I WAS HERE BECAUSE OF SOMETHING TO DO WITH WINE 
AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE DOING A BIT OF WINE TASTING 
COME AUCTION TIME HAVE WE SET OUR RESERVE PRICES TOO HIGH 
I HOPE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BREAK OPEN THEIR OWN PIGGY BANKS TO BUY THIS 
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TODAY'S COLLECTIBLES GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
I'VE COME JUST DOWN THE ROAD TO THE VILLAGE OF NEWTON POPPLEFORD 
ISN'T THAT A LOVELY NAME 
I'M HERE TO MEET TWO LADIES LOOKING TO MAKE A BIG CHANGE IN THEIR LIVES 
AFTER LIVING IN GREECE CAROLINE AND HER DAUGHTER JENNY 
MOVED BACK TO ENGLAND ABOUT THIRTEEN YEARS AGO 
TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD JENNY NOW WANTS TO SPREAD HER WINGS 
AND NOT ONLY FOLLOW IN HER MOTHER'S TRAVELLING FOOTSTEPS 
BUT BECOME AN EXPERT IN SOME OF THE FINER THINGS IN LIFE 
JENNIE MORNING TO YOU HOW ARE YOU 
YOU LOOK AS IF I'M LATE I'M NOT AM I 
WE'VE GOT A LOT TO DO TODAY 
IT'S SOMETHING TO DO WITH WINE 
OOH YOU CAN COUNT ME IN LET'S GO AND FIND OUT 
HELLO LADIES HI 
HELLO I HEARD I WAS HERE BECAUSE OF SOMETHING TO DO WITH WINE 
AND THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE WINE TASTING BUT JUST MY LUCK YOU'RE NOT 
IT'S A BIT EARLY I SUPPOSE SO I KNOW IT'S ABOUT WINE BUT WHY ARE WE HERE 
I DECIDED TO RELOCATE TO MY PARENTAL HOME IN DEVON 
I QUIT MY JOB IN LONDON AND I HAD QUITE A LOT OF STUFF WITH ME 
SO MUM DECIDED IF I COULD CLEAR OUT THE ATTIC 
ANYTHING I FOUND I COULD KEEP 
WHAT A BRILLIANT IDEA WOW 
I DECIDED WHATEVER MONEY I COULD RAISE I WOULD BUY MYSELF AN AIR TICKET TO AUSTRALIA TO AUSTRALIA 
YES BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO DO SOME WINE TASTING OUT THERE 
AND FIND OUT MORE ABOUT WINE MARKETING 
SO A BIG PASSION ABOUT WINE YEAH 
IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING I COULD SEE MYSELF LEARNING TO LOVE 
WELL I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA 
I THINK SO TOO A GIRL AFTER MY OWN HEART 
SO MUCH MONEY DO YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED FOR THE AIR TICKET 
AIR FLIGHTS ARE PRETTY EXPENSIVE 
I HOPE AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED 
EIGHT HUNDRED HAVE YOU GOT ENOUGH STUFF UP IN THE ATTIC 
I HOPE SO YEAH 
I HOPE SO TOO 
WE BETTER GET CRACKING SHOW ME ROUND THE HOUSE 
SOUNDS AS IF THERE COULD BE SOME EXCITING TIMES AHEAD FOR JENNY 
WITH THAT UNUSUAL CAREER CHOICE 
SO WE'D BETTER GET ON WITH THE TASK IN HAND AND RAISE LOTS OF MONEY 
BECAUSE SHE'D ALSO LIKE TO TAKE HER MOTHER ON A WINE TASTING COURSE 
OUR EXPERT JAMES SEEMS TO HAVE FOUND PLENTY TO SAVOUR IN HIS FIRST FIND OF THE DAY 
JAMES WE HAVE COME TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE UP TO LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND 
CAROLINE WHERE DID IT COME FROM 
THAT WAS A WEDDING GIFT WHEN I USED TO LIVE IN GREECE 
IT'S VERY ORNATE I MUST SAY 
IT'S NOT ENGLISH IT'S CERTAINLY A CONTINENTAL EITHER FRENCH OR ITALIAN PIECE 
I'M JUST HAVING A LOOK AND I CAN'T SEE 
IT DOESN'T HAVE SO MUCH AS A HALLMARK AS IT'S JUST STAMPED NINE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
AND THAT'S THE PERCENTAGE SILVER 
IN OTHER WORDS IT'S NINE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT SILVER 
WHICH FUNNILY ENOUGH IS THE SAME GRADE AS THE ENGLISH SILVER 
SO IT'S THE REAL THING IRONICALLY QUITE OFTEN 
WITHOUT HALLMARKS YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO CALL IT SILVER 
SILVER COLOURED METAL 
TRADE DESCRIPTIONS WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL OF THAT 
QUITE FANCY VERY MUCH OF ITS TIME LATE VICTORIAN ERA 
WHEN THINGS WERE SLIGHTLY OVER THE TOP DECORATION WISE 
YES IT WOULD HAVE STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF A DINING ROOM TABLE 
WITH SWEET BREAD SWEET MEATS BON BONS IN THE MIDDLE 
I'VE ALSO FOUND TWO MORE WELL DONE 
LOOK THREE FOR THE PRICE OF ONE 
EWERS I WILL CALL THEM EWERS 
I DON'T THINK YOU'D WANT TO POUR ANYTHING OUT OF THESE 
THEY ARE MORE DECORATIVE PURELY FOR DISPLAY 
AGAIN NINE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE CONTINENTAL SILVER 
BUT THEY'RE WHAT WE CALLED LOADED 
WHICH MEANS THAT THE BOTTOMS 
ARE FILLED WITH USUALLY PLASTER OR A BITUMEN TAR 
TO MAKE THEM APPEAR HEAVIER IN OTHER WORDS MORE VALUABLE 
BUT ALSO TO BE PRACTICAL IT STOPS THEM FALLING OVER 
WHAT DO WE THINK VALUE WISE 
I CERTAINLY THINK WE'D HOPEFULLY BE NORTH OF ONE HUNDRED QUID SO LET'S SAY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT WOW 
FOR SOMETHING IN THE ATTIC IT'S A GOOD START 
OH YEAH DEFINITELY 
VERY IMPRESSIVE WELL DONE 
GOOD FOR YOU LET'S FIND SOME MORE 
COME ON WHERE SHALL WE GO NEXT 
FANTASTIC 
THIS MEDITERRANEAN SILVERWARE WILL BE A RARE SIGHTING AT AUCTION 
AND COULD SELL VERY WELL 
WE'RE SEARCHING EVERY INCH OF CAROLINE AND JENNY'S HOUSE TO SEEK OUT THOSE PRIZE GEMS 
WHILE I'M IN THE BEDROOM DOWNSTAIRS THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN 
CAROLINE WITH YOUR GREEK CONNECTIONS 
I'M NOT SURPRISED YOU'VE SHOWN ME SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
WHERE DID IT COME FROM 
IT CAME FROM GREECE MY HUSBAND GAVE IT TO MY FATHER AS A GIFT 
IT'S AN ICON THEY CAME IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS 
SOME OF THEM LIKE THIS ARE PAINTED ON WOODEN PANELS 
SOME HAVE SILVER MOUNTS CALLED RIZAS 
AND IF YOU IMAGINE IN THOSE DAYS 
VERY FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY READ OR WROTE SO A VISUAL IMAGE 
WAS HUGELY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF NURTURING THEIR FAITH 
THIS ONE BELIEVE IT OR NOT AND HERE'S THE IRONY 
IT MAY HAVE COME TO YOU FROM GREECE 
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY OF SAINT MINAS AND I CAN SEE THE WRITING HERE IN GREEK 
WHO'S ACTUALLY FROM EGYPT 
NOW VALUE ON THIS I THINK MY FEELING LOOKING AT IT 
IS IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN MADE IN THE LAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
AND IT'S BEEN MADE MAYBE TO MAKE IT LOOK SLIGHTLY OLDER THAN IT REALLY IS 
ONE WAY I CAN TELL THAT IS BY LOOKING AT THE BACK 
BECAUSE SO OFTEN THESE ARE MADE ON WOODEN PANELS 
AND THIS IS VERY REGULAR VERY NEW LOOKING 
IT'S BEEN CUT NOT WITH A SORT OF ADZE OR A BAND SAW IT'S BEEN CUT 
USING A MECHANICAL SAW SO THAT GIVES US SOME IDEA OF TRYING TO DATE IT 
WHEREAS THE STYLE IS MUCH EARLIER 
I'M GOING TO STICK MY NECK OUT A LITTLE BIT 
AND SAY THAT I THINK IT SHOULD FETCH BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
YOU'D BE HAPPY AT THAT SORT OF FIGURE THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL 
GREAT LET'S JUST HOPE AT THE AUCTION THERE ARE GOING TO BE LOTS OF SERIOUS ICON COLLECTORS 
I WANT TO SEE WHAT ELSE YOU'VE GOT HIDDEN AWAY MAYBE UP IN THE ATTIC LET'S GET UP THERE 
I HOPE THAT PEOPLE APPRECIATE ICONS IN THIS COUNTRY 
AND THAT IT GOES TO A GOOD HOME 
IF THIS REALLY IS A MODERN REPLICA 
AN ESTIMATE UP TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEEMS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE 
AS WE CONTINUE OUR RUMMAGE JAMES COMES ACROSS CAROLINE'S COLLECTION 
OF DUSTY GREEN AND WHITE WEDGEWOOD WHICH COULD FETCH BETWEEN THIRTY TO FIFTY 
ANOTHER BOOST TO OUR FUNDS IS THIS INTRICATELY PATTERNED RUG 
PASSED DOWN THROUGH THE FAMILY AND IN FANTASTIC CONDITION 
JAMES VALUES IT AT FORTY TO SEVENTY 
CAROLINE AND JENNY HAVE BEEN LIVING HERE FOR TEN YEARS 
AND OVER A GLASS OF WINE I FINALLY GET THE CHANCE 
TO HEAR MORE ABOUT JENNY'S FORTHCOMING TRIP DOWN UNDER 
SO YOU'VE BEEN WORKING FOR A NEWS AGENCY FOR A FEW YEARS NOW 
AND THIS IS A BIT OF A CROSSROADS IN YOUR LIFE BECAUSE THE FUTURE IT SEEMS IS WINE EH 
YEAH I'VE DECIDED I'D LIKE TO DIVERSIFY CAREER TOWARDS THE WINE SECTOR 
WHAT BROUGHT THIS ON 
A PASSION AND INTEREST FOR WINE COMBINED WITH THE FACT 
THAT I SPEAK A COUPLE OF LANGUAGES AND HAVE AN INTEREST IN MARKETING 
I FIGURED I SHOULD GO TO AUSTRALIA AND TRY MY LUCK THERE 
I'D BE DISTRAUGHT IF MY LITTLE GIRL SAID THAT SHE WANTED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD TO LIVE 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT 
WELL I FEEL THAT YOU RAISE CHILDREN TO BE INDEPENDENT 
AND AUSTRALIA SEEMS TO BE WHERE HER DESTINY IS SO GO FOR IT 
OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT QUITE A SENSE OF ADVENTURE BECAUSE YOU LIVED IN GREECE FOR A LONG TIME 
ALMOST TWENTY YEARS YEAH YOUR HUSBAND WAS GREEK YES HE WAS 
HE WAS AN ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEON 
SADLY YOU WERE WIDOWED AT QUITE A YOUNG AGE BUT YOU CARRIED ON LIVING IN GREECE 
I HAD A BUSINESS OVER THERE 
AND I WANTED MY DAUGHTER TO GROW UP WITH SOME CULTURE AND 
THE INDEPENDENCE OF RUNNING AROUND ON THE BEACH AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME THAT THE REAL REASON 
YOU'RE GOING TO AUSTRALIA YOU'RE VERY TALL AREN'T YOU FIVE FOOT ELEVEN 
THAT'S RIGHT THERE'S LOTS OF BIG HUNKY MEN THERE IS THIS TRUE 
YOU COULD SAY I'VE DEVELOPED A FETISH FOR THE AUSSIE ACCENT 
WELL GOOD FOR YOU I WILL SAY CHEERS TO YOUR FUTURE 
CHEERS CHEERS AND WE'VE GOT TO CARRY ON HUNTING COME ON OFF WE GO 
SO WE'D BETTER MAKE SURE JENNY'S DREAM COMES TRUE AND RAISE THAT MONEY FOR HER FLIGHT TO AUSTRALIA 
AND IF THERE'S ANY LEFT OVER SHE AND HER MUM CAN HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY'S WINE TASTING 
CAROLINE IS KEEPING US ALL ON OUR TOES 
AND HAS FOUND A MAN'S OMEGA WATCH 
WHICH COULD BRING IN ANYTHING BETWEEN SIXTY AND ONE HUNDRED 
ANOTHER FIND WHICH WILL BE HEADING TO AUCTION 
IS THIS COLLECTION OF CLASSIC BOOKS INCLUDING WORKS BY VICTOR HUGO 
THEY ONCE BELONGED TO JENNY'S GRANDMOTHER AND JAMES VALUES THEM AT BETWEEN SIXTY AND EIGHTY 
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO DO IF WE'RE TO GET ANYWHERE NEAR OUR 
TARGET OF EIGHT HUNDRED SO I TRACK DOWN OUR EXPERT TO SEE WHAT HE'S UP TO 
JAMES ARE YOU TAKING TIME OUT OR OUR YOU WORKING NO I'M WORKING 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE WE HAVE GOT SOME PLATES 
WITH SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND'S FAVOURITE LITERARY HEROES 
WE'VE GOT WEE ROBBIE BURNS ON THIS ONE FOR SCOTLAND 
AND OLD WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE FOR ENGLAND ON THIS ONE 
BUT WHAT REALLY INTERESTS ME IS WHAT'S ON THE BACK 
BECAUSE WRITTEN HERE IS THE ROWLAND AND AMP MARSELLUS CO 
STAFFORDSHIRE ENGLAND 
THESE WERE MADE IN ENGLAND 
BUT IN FACT ROWLAND AND AMP MARSELLUS WERE RETAILERS OVER IN NEW YORK 
THEY RETAILED A LOT OF STAFFORDSHIRE ROUND THE REST OF THE STATES 
SO WHAT WOULD YOU WANT AS A SOUVENIR OF LITTLE OLD ENGLAND 
BUT ROBBIE BURNS FOR SCOTLAND AND WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 
IT'S LIKE A BIT OF THE OLD COUNTRY 
THEY HAVE SUFFERED SLIGHTLY THESE PLATES BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK HERE 
YOU'LL SEE THERE'S THE ODD CHIP BUT ALSO WHAT WE CALL THIS STAINED CRAQUELEUR 
IT'S WHERE THE GLAZE HAS CRACKED AND DIRT OVER THE YEARS HAS GOT IN 
YOU CAN SORT THAT OUT QUITE EASILY BY PUTTING IT IN ONE OF THOSE VERY MILD CLOTHES WASHING DETERGENTS 
VALUE WISE CERTAINLY TWENTY TO THIRTY SOMETHING LIKE THAT GOSH THAT'S NICE 
O. K. UPWARDS AND ONWARDS NOT THERE YET COME ON LET'S FIND SOME MORE 
I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THEY HAD SUCH A CONNECTION WITH THE STATES 
I'M NOT TERRIBLY IMPRESSED WITH THE PRICE BUT THEN SOMETHING'S BETTER THAN NOTHING 
SOMETIMES THE SMALLEST OF FINDS CAN WORK WONDERS AT AUCTION AND THESE DELICATE GOLD CHARMS 
BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED IN THE SHAPE OF A WELL AND A CHURCH COULD BRING IN UP TO SIXTY 
IN THE GARAGE JENNY PULLS OUT ONE OF THE TOP POTENTIAL MONEY MAKERS OF THE DAY 
THIS LIMITED EDITION WADE PIG WHICH COULD BE WORTH AS MUCH AS FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
AS THE RUMMAGE DRAWS TO A CLOSE WE ALL GATHER TO MUSE OVER THE LAST FIND OF THE DAY 
LOOK AT THIS IT'S A CASE OF ALL THAT GLITTERS IS GOLD 
YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT TWO REALLY QUITE SPECIALISED COINS HERE 
THE FIRST ONE I'M LOOKING AT HERE IS A ONE HUNDRED CORONA PIECE 
IT'S ACTUALLY AUSTRIAN YOU CAN SEE ON IT ONE HUNDRED CORONA 
AND THE AUSTRIAN COAT OF ARMS DATED NINETEEN FIFTEEN 
AND WE'VE GOT THE EMPEROR FRANZ JOSEF ON THE BACK AND IT'S DATED NINETEEN FIFTEEN 
FUNNILY ENOUGH THE OTHER COIN IS ALSO DATED NINETEEN FIFTEEN 
IT'S ALSO AUSTRIAN BUT IN THIS CASE IT'S A FOUR DUCAT PIECE 
TO MAKE IT REALLY CONFUSING THAT IS NOT WHEN IT WAS MADE OH 
THEY WERE MADE AS COMMEMORATIVE COINS 
FRANZ JOSEF I THINK DIED IN ABOUT NINETEEN SIXTEEN AND THEY MINTED THESE BETWEEN 
NINETEEN TWENTY AND NINETEEN THIRTY SIX WHERE THEY PRODUCED HALF A MILLION OF THOSE 
AND THEY ALL HAD THE SAME DATE THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME DATE HOW BIZARRE 
ALL YOU CAN BE CERTAIN OF IF IT'S A ONE HUNDRED CORONA PIECE 
OR A FOUR DUCAT PIECE IT DOESN'T DATE TO NINETEEN FIFTEEN H. M. M. 
YOU'VE ALSO GOT TWO HALF SOVEREIGNS HERE 
ONE OF THEM IS RARER THAN THE OTHER 
IT'S GOT THE S. A. STAMP ON IT WHICH IS SOUTH AFRICA 
SO THERE IS ACTUALLY QUITE A LOT OF MONEY INVOLVED IN THESE 
WOO GOSH EXCITING 
I'M NOT A COIN SPECIALIST BUT I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
AT THE MOMENT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE GETTING ON FOR FIVE HUNDRED OOH 
AND MAYBE THE FOUR DUCAT PIECE MAYBE TWO HUNDRED 
MAYBE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOR THE SOUTH AFRICA HALF SOVEREIGN SIXTY FOR THE OTHER ONE 
AS I SAY I'M NOT AN EXPERT BUT I DO THINK WE'VE GOT TO MAYBE CONSIDER 
GOING ON A MORE SPECIALIST ROUTE 
AND I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT GOING TO AN AUCTION HOUSE THAT DEALS IN 
EVERYTHING FROM PICTURES TO FURNITURE AND WHATEVER IS THE BEST PLACE YOU NEED A SPECIALIST 
WE NEED A SPECIALIST YEAH 
ARE THESE SOMETHING YOU WOULD CONSIDER AT LEAST PUTTING IN THE AUCTION 
UM YEAH I MIGHT DO I THINK I'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT THOUGH 
DO YOU AGREE YES 
THAT MAKES THINGS VERY INTERESTING 
IF WE INCLUDE THE GOLD SOVEREIGNS 
THE TOTAL WE'VE RAISED TODAY COMES TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE 
AND EVEN IF THE GIRLS DECIDE NOT TO SELL THEM 
THEIR OTHER COLLECTIBLES STILL ADD UP TO A VERY IMPRESSIVE ONE THOUSAND FIVE 
COMFORTABLY OVER THEIR TARGET 
ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO NOW IS KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED AND OF COURSE 
PACK EVERYTHING READY FOR THE AUCTION ARE YOU GOOD AT PACKING 
PRETTY GOOD THANK YOU 
HAD A LOT OF PRACTICE O. K. 
WELL DONE THANKS THANK YOU CHEERS 
IT'S BEEN FASCINATING DIPPING INTO CAROLINE AND JENNY'S LIVES 
AND WE'VE FOUND SOME EXTRAORDINARY PIECES TO TAKE TO AUCTION 
HERE ARE SOME OF THE MOST INTERESTING 
THE GLEAMING SILVER EWERS AND ORNATELY DECORATED SILVER PLATE 
WHICH COULD BRING IN BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY AND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
VALUED BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY ARE THE WONDERFUL BLUE PLATES 
DEPICTING LITERARY LEGENDS ROBBIE BURNS AND WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 
THE GREEK ICON OF SAINT MINAS 
GIVEN TO CAROLINE'S FATHER AS A WEDDING PRESENT 
COULD FETCH A WHOPPING THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
LAST BUT DEFINITELY NOT LEAST ARE THE FOUR MAGNIFICENT GOLD COINS 
BUT WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A WAIT ON OUR HANDS 
TO FIND OUT WHETHER CAROLINE DECIDES TO PART WITH THEM 
STILL TO COME ON CASH IN THE ATTIC 
AT AUCTION OUR JAMES IS GIVEN A RUN FOR HIS MONEY 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE A BIT OF AN EXPERT I THINK 
BUT NOT EVERYTHING IS PLAIN SAILING 
IT WAS WORTH A TRY AND IT DIDN'T COME OFF

EVERYONE'S BEEN REALLY BUSY IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS 
AND WE'VE BROUGHT ALL CAROLINE AND JENNY'S COLLECTIBLES FROM DEVON
