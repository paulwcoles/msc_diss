YOU CAN WORK IT OUT IF YOU JUST LEARN ABOUT 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN RIDE 
OR BUMP AND JUMP GLIDE AND SLIDE 
TAKE A LITTLE LOOK INSIDE THE WAY THINGS WORK 
AND WATCH THE THINGAMABOB THAT TURNS THE KNOB 
THAT MAKES THE JIGGER JIG 
THAT TURNS THE THINGAMAJIG THAT PULLS THE TRIGGER 
THAT MAKES THE DIGGER DIG 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN FLY 
WITHOUT A WING OR STRING TO TIE WITH 
YOU FIND THE SAME RULES APPLY WITH 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUEL BURNING ENGINE ON MAMMOTH ISLAND WAS 
STRANGELY ENOUGH INSPIRED BY THE HUMBLE BUT TASTY PIZZA 
BUY A MAMMOTH PIZZA 
IF OUR MAMMOTH DELIVERY DOESN'T GET ONE TO YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES IT'S FREE 
I WONDERED WHETHER THIS WOULD BE A PROFITABLE EXERCISE 
GIVEN THE MAMMOTH'S DOCILE NATURE 
AND THEIR INABILITY TO FIND ANY GIVEN ADDRESS 
ORDER YOUR PIZZA LATE DELIVERY AND YOU GET ONE FREE 
FRANK AND PILBEAM SET OFF FIREWORKS TO CELEBRATE THE PIZZA PARLOUR 
WELL THE MARMOTS SEEMS TO LIKE IT PILBEAM 
THE ORDERS WERE COMING IN QUICKLY 
AND OLIVE WAS IN CHARGE OF DISPATCHING THE DELIVERY MAMMOTHS 
HERE YOU ARE MAMMOTH BUT PLEASE TRY TO BE BIT QUICKER 
LAST TIME YOU WERE AGES AND ATE THE PIZZA YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DELIVER 
AND TRY TO BRING BACK SOME MONEY 
WHAT DID YOU SAY OLIVE NOTHING 
JUST THAT YOU WERE GETTING SO GOOD AT MAKING DELICIOUS PIZZAS 
WATCH THIS WOO WOO YEAH 
NICE ONE 
ANOTHER ORDER 
MAMMOTH PIZZA 
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING HOW LONG 
YEUCH OH IT'S STICKY AND DISGUSTING 
NO NOT YOU SIR I'M SURE YOU'RE NEITHER STICKY NOR DISGUSTING 
OF COURSE YOU'LL GET A FREE PIZZA WHEN IT SHOWS UP GOODBYE 
OLIVE 
UH OH HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE WE MADE TODAY LET ME JUST CHECK 
ER NOTHING 
IT'S THAT MAMMOTH DELIVERY IT'S GOING TO RUIN US 
IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT AUNTIE BRENDA 
MAMMOTHS CAN DO AMAZING THINGS 
BUT PERHAPS EXPECTING SPEEDY PIZZA DELIVERIES IS JUST A BIT TOO MUCH 
BUT I'VE GOT POSTERS ALL OVER THE ISLAND 
PROMISING PIZZAS DELIVERED WITHIN THIRTY MINUTES 
OH 
DON'T PANIC AUNTIE BRENDA I'M SURE THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO 
HOW ARE WE GOING TO SPEED UP A TEN TONNE MAMMOTH 
I DON'T KNOW BUT THERE MUST BE A WAY 
OLIVE STEPPED INTO THE NIGHT AIR TO COLLECT HER THOUGHTS 
AND THAT WAS WHEN I ARRIVED 
HAVING WAITED OVER THREE HOURS IN VAIN FOR MY PIZZA TO BE DELIVERED 
I WAS STARVING 
ALL RIGHT PILBEAM LET'S GO FOR THE BIG ONE RIGHT OH FRANK 
THREE TWO ONE FIRE 
NOW THAT COULD BE USEFUL 
I'VE GOT IT I'VE GOT IT 
I'VE GOT IT GOT WHAT OLIVE MY PIZZA PERHAPS I'M FAMISHED 
DON'T THINK ABOUT YOUR STOMACH 
WHY DON'T WE USE A ROCKET TO DELIVER OUR PIZZAS ON TIME 
THE ROCKET IS THE SIMPLEST KIND OF HEAT ENGINE IT BURNS FUEL IN THIS COMBUSTION CHAMBER 
THE HOT GASES PRODUCED EXPAND GREATLY AND RUSH FROM THE OPEN END 
DRIVING THE ROCKET UP INTO THE AIR 
THIS ROCKET ENGINE HAS AN IGNITER AT THE TOP 
A CHANNEL FOR THE HOT EXPANDED GASES 
THE SOLID FUEL IS PACKED BETWEEN THE CHANNEL AND THE CASING 
WHILST THE NOZZLE AT THE BOTTOM CAN BE SWIVELLED IN ORDER TO STEER IT 
AH 
HAVING FOUND SOME BITS TO WORK WITH 
OLIVE ASKED FRANK AND PILBEAM TO MAKE A ROCKET POWERED VEHICLE 
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE NEAR THIS WHEN IT GOES OFF 
THE TWO ROCKETS WERE MOUNTED ONTO A WAGON AND TROY WAS TEST PILOT 
WHY DO I HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE MAMMOTHS CAN'T DRIVE 
OH RIGHT TED I BETTER GET STRAPPED IN THEN 
WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU LOT PLAYING AT 
WE'VE GOT PIZZAS TO DELIVER 
DON'T WORRY AUNTIE BRENDA THIS IS THE ANSWER TO ALL OUR PROBLEMS 
START THE ENGINES 
W. H. A. A A A 
I HOPE HE KNOWS HOW TO STOP THAT THING 
NO THERE'S NO STOPPING A ROCKET LIKE THAT THERE ISN'T 
OH NO THEY JUST GO AND GO UNTIL THEIR FUEL RUNS OUT REALLY 
UH HOW MUCH FUEL DID YOU TWO PUT IN THERE ANYWAY 
IT WASN'T THAT MUCH WAS IT PILBEAM 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD GET TO THE MOON 
W. H. A. A A A A 
I DO MISS MY BOY 
HELLO HELLO 
THIS IS A COLLECT CALL FROM DODO ISLAND 
DODO ISLAND TROY 
AH TROY 
GET BACK HERE THIS INSTANT 
WE'VE GOT PIZZAS TO DELIVER BUT MUM 
THE CHIEF HERE SAYS HE REALLY LOVES YOUR PIZZA HE MIGHT ASK FOR MORE 
OH ALL RIGHT THEN BUT MAKE SURE YOU GET HIS MONEY 
HIS WAS THE FIRST PIZZA TO BE DELIVERED IN LESS THAN THIRTY MINUTES 
PERHAPS IF I ATE SOME PIZZA I'D THINK A BIT MORE CLEARLY 
WELL GO AND HAVE ONE BUT BEFORE YOU DO HAVE YOU GOT ANY IDEAS 
PERHAPS IF WE USED KEROSENE 
WE COULD TURN OFF THE SUPPLY WHEN WE WANTED TO STOP THE WAGON 
WHAT A GREAT IDEA YOU'VE CERTAINLY EARNED YOUR PIZZA 
COME ON LET'S GET ON WITH IT 
AH 
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT UNTIL YOU'VE PAID FOR IT 
BUT I'VE WAITED OVER THREE HOURS FOR THIS 
ANYWAY I'M FAMISHED SO I'LL HAVE A SECOND ONE AND PAY FOR IT 
UH UH UH 
OH ALL RIGHT THEN 
AH THAT WAS BRILLIANT 
AFTER I HAD EATEN EIGHT BRENDA GAVE ME ANOTHER FREE ONE 
WHAT'S THIS OUR NEW CONTROLLABLE ROCKET DRIVEN PIZZA DELIVERY WAGON 
START HER UP 
THERE SHE GOES NO SHE DOESN'T 
WHAT THE ISLANDERS HAD FAILED TO DO 
WAS INCLUDE OXYGEN OR AIR TO ENABLE THE FUEL TO BURN 
TAKE THIS SPACECRAFT 
IT HAS A FUEL TANK AND AN OXIDISER TANK 
THESE ARE FED INTO THIS COMBUSTION CHAMBER WHERE THEY ARE IGNITED 
THUS PROPELLING THE CRAFT THROUGH THE EMISSION FROM THIS NOZZLE 
WELL THAT WASN'T MUCH GOOD THEN 
WASN'T A BAD TRY EXCEPT FOR THE LACK OF OXYGEN 
WHAT'S THAT SMELL IT'S DELICIOUS 
THE FAN'S BLOWING IT OVER HERE 
DAD GREAT IDEA WHY CAN'T WE USE A FAN TO BLOW AIR INTO OUR ENGINE 
INVINCIBLE OLIVE WAS RIGHT 
A TURBO FANNED JET ENGINE WHICH POWERS BIG AIRLINERS 
USES A LARGE ROTATING FAN TO DRIVE AIR INTO THESE COMPRESSORS 
BURNING KEROSENE IN THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER HEATS THE AIR 
WHICH EXPANDS AND RUSHES TOWARDS THE EXHAUST 
TURNING A TURBINE TO DRIVE THE COMPRESSORS AND THE FAN 
MORE AIR IS SUCKED AROUND THE OUTSIDE COOLING THE ENGINE 
AND THEN JOINING THE HEATED AIR 
SO A GREAT VOLUME OF AIR SPEEDS FROM THE ENGINE 
DRIVING THE AIRCRAFT FORWARDS WITH TREMENDOUS FORCE 
AND THE ADVANTAGE OF A JET ENGINE OVER A ROCKET 
IS IT DOESN'T NEED TO CARRY ITS OWN ROCKET SUPPLY THUS SAVING WEIGHT 
THE DISADVANTAGE IS IT WON'T WORK IN SPACE AS IT HAS NO ATMOSPHERE 
TIME TO START THE JET ENGINES 
THEY HAD BETTER WORK THIS TIME 
HOT PIZZA COMING UP 
WHOA 
PPT 
PILBEAM LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE 
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING IT WAS THAT NEWFANGLED ENGINE 
OH ENGINES IS THAT ALL YOU CAN THINK OF AT A TIME LIKE THIS 
PERSONALLY I WAS ALWAYS QUITE HAPPY WITH MAMMOTH POWER 
LET'S LET OFF THESE FIREWORKS PERHAPS THEY'LL CHEER BRENDA UP 
THE LAST ROCKET WAS DEFECTIVE 
AND ENDED UP SAILING THROUGH THE MARMOTS' BURROWS 
THE EXPANDING GASES OF THE BURNING FUEL EXERTED AN UPWARD FORCE 
ON THE POOR LITTLE MARMOTS 
WHAT WE HAD OBSERVED THE MARMOTS DOING 
WAS THE KEY TO THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE OF THE PETROL ENGINE 
OR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE 
HERE A SERIES OF PISTONS ARE ATTACHED TO A SINGLE CRANKSHAFT 
ANOTHER LIQUID FUEL PETROL IS MIXED WITH AIR 
SPRAYED INTO THE CYLINDER AND COMPRESSED BY THE PISTON 
THE AIR SLASH PETROL MIXTURE IS IGNITED BY A SPARK 
AND THE RESULTING EXPLOSION PUSHES THE PISTON DOWN 
THE EXHAUST IS CLEARED AS THE PISTON RISES AGAIN 
AND THE CYCLE REPEATS ITSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
THE PETROL ENGINE THE ISLANDERS BUILT WAS FAST AND POWERFUL 
AND ALSO VERY SUITED TO THE STOP AND START NATURE OF PIZZA DELIVERY 
ALL RIGHT TROY 
YOU ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO DELIVER THESE PIZZAS 
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT 
NO PROBLEM MUM PASS THEM TO THE MAMMOTH AND WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT 
THE MAMMOTH I THOUGHT WE GOT RID OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO SLOW 
BUT OUR ADVERT PROMISES FREE MAMMOTH DELIVERY 
PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING IT YES WE JUST CAN'T DO WITHOUT THEM 
ALL RIGHT AS LONG AS WE KEEP THE THIRTY MINUTE PIZZA PROMISE 
I DON'T MIND WHAT YOU DO 
AT LEAST WE GOT ONE THING RIGHT 
THE DEAR OLD MAMMOTH 
YEAH HE'S A FANTASTIC FRISBEE FLINGER 
THERE YOU GO BOY 
LAUNCH PIZZA 
HE HASN'T MISSED A TARGET YET 
AND NOT ONLY THAT HE LOOKS KIND OF COOL BACK THERE DON'T YOU THINK 
COOL 
TOTALLY FRIGID MAN 
I DECIDED TO MAKE A TIME CAPSULE BOX 
TO SHOW MY CHILDREN WHAT I WAS LIKE AS A CHILD 
THIS IS MY BOX 
AND I PUT ALL THE THINGS ALL THE THINGS THAT I LIKE 
UM THE TEACHER DONE IT 
UM OF ME I THINK IT'S QUITE GOOD 
THESE ARE ANOTHER FAVOURITE OF MINE THEY'RE DREAM DOLLS 
THAT MY MOTHER GAVE ME AT CHRISTMAS COS I USED TO HAVE BAD DREAMS 
BUT NOW I DON'T HAVE ANY BAD DREAMS COS I TELL THESE EVERY NIGHT 
WHAT DREAM I WANT TO HAVE 
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE DOLL HER NAME IS SAMMY 
SHE'S SIX YEARS OLD 
SHE GOES TO SCHOOL 
SHE'S VERY GOOD AT MATHS 
HE'S DOING A MOVE CALLED A FREEZE 
WHERE THE IDEA IS TO CROSS YOUR LEGS OVER IN THE AIR 
WHILE BALANCING ON ONE HAND 
UM IT'S A VERY HARD MOVE AND I DOUBT I'LL EVER DO IT 
A STRANGE INSTRUMENT 
IT'S CALLED A NOSE FLUTE 
AND YOU PLAY IT LIKE THIS 
AND IT'S VERY HARD TO OPERATE IT'S MY HOBBY 
HERE'S A PIECE OF MY HANDWRITING THAT I HAVE 
MY HANDWRITING'S NOT VERY GOOD I'LL JUST READ WHAT IT SAYS 
HI KIDS THIS IS ME WHEN I WAS TEN 
THIS IS MY HANDWRITING IT'S NOT THE BEST 
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN IT WAS 
I HOPE MY KIDS HAVE BETTER HANDWRITING THAN ME
