IN THIS FILM ELEPHANTS TAKE US CLOSER TO TIGERS THAN EVER BEFORE 
THEY ENTER THE TIGERS' WORLD ARMED ONLY WITH SPY CAMS 
USING THESE NEW DEVICES THEY HELP TELL THE STORY OF CUBS GROWING UP 
THEY ARE OUR SPIES IN THE JUNGLE 
ELEPHANTS HAVE BEEN USED FOR CENTURIES TO SEARCH FOR TIGERS 
THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO ENTER THE TIGERS' DARK AND MYSTERIOUS WORLD 
INDIA'S FEW REMAINING TIGERS LIVE IN DENSE FOREST 
AND THAT MAKES FILMING THEIR BEHAVIOUR ONE OF THE LAST GREAT WILDLIFE CHALLENGES 
THIS IS PENCH TIGER RESERVE IN CENTRAL INDIA ONE OF THE TIGERS' LAST STRONGHOLDS 
EVEN HERE TIGERS ARE ELUSIVE 
BUT FORTUNATELY THEY OFTEN LEAVE THEIR MARK 
FROM THESE FOOTPRINTS THE MAHOUTS WHO RIDE THE ELEPHANTS 
CAN TELL BOTH THE SEX OF A TIGER AND HOW RECENTLY IT PASSED BY 
THESE ARE FRESH 
TIME TO DEPLOY A SECRET WEAPON 
TRUNK CAM IS SPECIALLY DESIGNED TO FILM TIGERS IN HIGH DEFINITION WHILE ON THE MOVE 
IT'S CARRIED BY WHAT MUST BE THE ULTIMATE ALL TERRAIN CAMERA VEHICLE AN ELEPHANT 
THESE ECO FRIENDLY FOUR BY FOURS CAN TAKE TRUNK CAM WHEREVER A TIGER GOES 
AND IT CAN START FILMING THE MOMENT 
THE ALARM CALLS OF PREY ANIMALS GIVE AWAY THE TIGER'S LOCATION 
THE HUMAN CAMERA CREW FILM FROM ANOTHER ELEPHANT AND ADJUST TRUNK CAM USING REMOTE CONTROL 
THE ELEPHANTS GIVE US EXTRAORDINARY ACCESS TO THE TIGERS 
THEY ARE AFTER ALL NATURAL INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST SO THE TIGERS AREN'T AT ALL PHASED BY THEM 
THESE INNOVATIVE FILMING TECHNIQUES HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE 
OVER A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS TO CAPTURE THE MOST INTIMATE PORTRAIT OF TIGERS EVER SEEN 
THEY GAVE US ASTOUNDING INSIGHTS INTO THE TIGERS' PRIVATE WORLD 
AND CAPTURED BEHAVIOUR NEVER WITNESSED BEFORE 
OUR STORY BEGINS WITH A TANTALISING GLIMPSE OF SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL 
A CUB JUST TEN DAYS OLD 
WILD CUBS AS YOUNG AS THIS HAVE NEVER BEEN FILMED BEFORE 
FOR THEIR FIRST SIX WEEKS 
MOST CUBS USUALLY HIDE AWAY IN THEIR DENS HARDLY GLIMPSING DAYLIGHT 
THESE ARE UNUSUALLY ADVENTUROUS 
THEY SEEM TOTALLY UNAWARE OF THE DANGERS 
ALTHOUGH THEIR EYES ARE JUST OPENING 
THEY WON'T SEE CLEARLY FOR ANOTHER SIX WEEKS 
THEY'RE THE MOTHER'S FIRST LITTER 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE QUITE A TEST FOR HER 
THE TIGRESS MUST PICK THEM UP BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK 
IT'S A DELICATE OPERATION 
A LITTLE TOO MUCH PRESSURE AND SHE'LL HURT HER CUB 
SHE CAN BITE WITH THE FORCE OF ONE THOUSAND POUNDS 
BUT THIS REQUIRES THE GENTLEST TOUCH 
TIGERS USUALLY HAVE TWO OR THREE CUBS 
FOUR ARE QUITE A HANDFUL 
AND THESE ALREADY SEEM MORE CHALLENGING THAN MOST 
THE RATIO BETWEEN THE SEXES AMONG NEWBORNS IS USUALLY EQUAL 
TRUE TO FORM TWO OF THESE CUBS ARE MALE AND TWO ARE FEMALE 
IT WILL BE RARE INDEED FOR ALL FOUR OF THEM TO REACH MATURITY 
MANY DANGERS LIE AHEAD 
AT THIS SIZE THEY MAKE A SNACK FOR EVEN THE SMALLEST PREDATOR 
THEIR MOTHER MUST MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS ACCOUNTED FOR 
WITH TWO BACK IN THE DEN AND ONE ON ITS WAY 
THERE'S ONLY ONE STRAGGLER LEFT TO WORRY ABOUT 
THE CUB'S CONTACT CRY MAKES SURE HE'S NOT FORGOTTEN 
AS LONG AS THE CUBS CALL THEIR MOTHER IS COMPELLED 
TO KEEP RETRIEVING THEM BUT THIS WOULD TRY ANY MOTHER'S PATIENCE 
A YOUNG CUB'S LIFE IS VERY PRECARIOUS 
HAD THE MOTHER BEEN AWAY HUNTING AT A MOMENT LIKE THIS 
THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT 
SHE'S CLEARLY GOING TO BE A DEVOTED MOTHER 
BUT SHE STILL HAS A LOT TO LEARN 
THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT 
FILMING SUCH BEHAVIOUR IS UNPRECEDENTED 
IT GIVES US AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY 
TO FOLLOW THESE CUBS AS THEY GROW 
TO DO THAT THE ELEPHANT CREW WILL NEED MORE SPY CAMS 
AS ITS NAME SUGGESTS TUSK CAM IS MOUNTED ON THE ELEPHANT'S TUSK 
IT'S SMALLER THAN TRUNK CAM SO IT CAN BE CARRIED AT ALL TIMES PERFECT FOR SHOTS ON THE MOVE 
IT'S USUALLY THE FIRST CAMERA TO FILM A TIGER 
AND IT NOW HAS A LOCAL CELEBRITY IN ITS SIGHTS 
THIS IS CHARGER THE FATHER OF THE CUBS 
WORRYINGLY HE GOT HIS NAME FROM HIS READINESS TO CHARGE 
IT'S CLEARLY A JOB FOR TRUNK CAM A SPY CAM WITH HIDDEN TALENTS 
CHARGER WILL ATTACK WITHOUT PROVOCATION 
BUT TRUNK CAM IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO LOOK HARMLESS 
CHARGER REACTS SURPRISINGLY CALMLY TO THIS MOTORISED TREE TRUNK 
HE'S LESS A TIGER 
MORE LIKE A PUSSY CAT 
EVEN THE CAMERA'S PANS AND ZOOMS PROVOKE LITTLE REACTION 
BUT THEN SOMETHING STRANGE CATCHES CHARGER'S EYE 
HE SEES WHAT HE THINKS IS ANOTHER TIGER 
IT COULD BE AN EXPENSIVE TIME FOR A PIECE OF KIT 
THAT COSTS AS MUCH AS A SMALL HOUSE 
BUT CHARGER ISN'T EASILY INTIMIDATED 
WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR HIS CUBS 
MORE CUBS ARE KILLED BY RIVAL MALES THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
BUT WHILE CHARGER IS AROUND HIS CUBS ARE SAFE 
THE MOTHER AND CUBS RARELY MEET THE FATHER 
AND HE NEVER JOINS HER ON THE HUNT 
NOT THAT SHE NEEDS MUCH HELP 
PENCH HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OF GAME IN ALL INDIA 
SO THIS TIGRESS NEVER HAS TO TRAVEL FAR FOR A MEAL 
EVEN SO BRINGING UP FOUR CUBS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY 
ESPECIALLY ONES AS ADVENTUROUS AS THESE 
SOME TIGER TERRITORIES MAY COVER AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDRED SQUARE MILES BUT IN PRIME HUNTING COUNTRY 
LIKE THIS AS LITTLE AS TEN SQUARE MILES CAN BE ENOUGH 
WITHIN THIS SHE KNOWS ALL THE HOTSPOTS FOR GAME 
PARTS OF THE FOREST POSITIVELY TEEM WITH LIFE 
BUT MORE PREY MEANS MORE EYES ON THE LOOKOUT 
FRUSTRATION IS ALL TOO FREQUENT 
FORTUNATELY IN THIS NECK OF THE WOODS 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF ALTERNATIVES SHE JUST HAS TO KEEP WALKING 
HER AIM IS TO STALK WITHIN THIRTY METRES WITHOUT BEING SEEN 
IF THERE'S A CHOICE SHE'LL SELECT LARGER DEER LIKE SAMBAR 
A SAMBAR STAG IS THE BEST PRIZE OF ALL 
MOST HUNTS LIKE THIS ONE END IN DISAPPOINTMENT 
WHILE SHE'S ON THE PROWL HER CUBS SHOULD BE SAFELY TUCKED UP IN THEIR DEN 
BUT THESE ARE NO ORDINARY CUBS 
NOW'S HE'S IN GREAT DANGER 
WITH HIS MOTHER AWAY ANY PASSING PREDATOR WOULD JUMP AT THE CHANCE OF SUCH AN EASY MEAL 
LEOPARDS KILL TIGER CUBS WITHOUT HESITATION 
PERHAPS THEY SEE THEM AS FUTURE COMPETITORS 
PENCH PARK HAS A THRIVING POPULATION OF LEOPARDS 
THEY FAR OUTNUMBER TIGERS SO A LOST CUB IS IN REAL DANGER 
HIS BEST DEFENCE IS TO REMAIN STILL 
HIDING UNDER A LEAF IS A SOMEWHAT NOVEL ALTERNATIVE 
FORTUNATELY MOTHER TIGERS NEVER LEAVE THEIR YOUNG CUBS FOR LONG 
BUT THEY DON'T USUALLY HAVE SUCH A PROBLEM RECOGNISING THEM 
HER CUBS SEEM TO HAVE A DEATH WISH 
IF THEY'RE TO SURVIVE THEY HAVE A LOT TO LEARN 
WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO WATCH THEM FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS 
AS THEY ACQUIRE THE SKILLS THEY WILL NEED TO SURVIVE 
BUT NOW THE MONSOON BRINGS FILMING TO A HALT 
THE PARK IS CLOSED AND THE CAMERA ELEPHANTS ARE REDEPLOYED ON ANTI POACHING PATROLS 
THE MONSOON REFRESHES THE LAND AND REFILLS THE RESERVOIRS THAT WILL BE SO VALUABLE DURING THE DRIER MONTHS 
THE PARK IS TRANSFORMED INTO A LUSH GREEN OASIS 
BUT DESPITE THE TRANQUILLITY THE HEAVY RAINS MAKE THIS A HAZARDOUS TIME FOR SMALL CUBS 
TEN WEEKS PASS AND THE CAMERA ELEPHANTS RETURN TO FILMING DUTIES 
AFTER A LONG SEARCH THEY FIND THE TIGRESS 
BUT WORRYINGLY HER CUBS ARE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN 
THE ELEPHANTS FOLLOW HER TOWARDS ONE OF HER FAVOURITE DEN SITES 
IT'S GOOD NEWS 
AT LEAST THREE CUBS HAVE SURVIVED 
AND THEN A FOURTH 
THE CUBS ARE NOW THREE MONTHS OLD 
THEY HAVE STOPPED HIDING IN THEIR DENS AND VENTURE OUT EVERY DAY 
BUT ONLY WHEN THEIR MOTHER IS AROUND 
THEY SOMETIMES ACCOMPANY HER ON HUNTING TRIPS AND THEY MOVE 
FROM ONE DEN SITE TO ANOTHER AS SHE TRAVELS AROUND HER TERRITORY 
PLAY IT SEEMS IS NEVER FAR FROM THEIR MIND 
IT'S GOOD FOR PRACTISING HUNTING SKILLS AND IT'S ALSO A LOT OF FUN 
WHILE THEY GET RID OF THEIR SURPLUS ENERGY THE MOTHER HAS SOME TIME FOR HERSELF 
EVEN AT THIS AGE HER CUBS CAN BE QUITE A HANDFUL 
ALL THIS PLAY DEVELOPS THEIR STRENGTH AND CO ORDINATION 
AND IT OCCUPIES A LOT OF THEIR TIME 
THEY PLAY FOR A THIRD OF THE DAY AND SLEEP FOR ANOTHER THIRD 
THE REST OF THE TIME THEY EAT 
THEY'RE GROWING FAST PUTTING ON AROUND THREE QUARTERS OF A KILO EACH WEEK 
ALTHOUGH THEY LOOK SMALL NEXT TO THEIR MOTHER THEY ARE ALREADY TWICE THE WEIGHT OF A DOMESTIC CAT 
THEY'VE JUST STARTED TO TAKE MEAT BUT THEIR MOTHER'S MILK STILL PROVIDES MOST OF THEIR NOURISHMENT 
WITH THE CUBS OUT AND ABOUT KEEPING UP WITH THEM 
IS A CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGE FOR THE CAMERA TEAM BUT HELP IS ON ITS WAY 
MEET LOG CAM A SMALL REMOTE CAMERA THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED QUICKLY BY THE ELEPHANTS THEMSELVES 
IT CAN BE PLACED AROUND WATERHOLES OR ON ANIMAL PATHS AND TRACKS 
THE CAMERA IS TRIGGERED BY ANY MOVEMENT OF A NEARBY ANIMAL 
LEFT ALONE IT CAN LIE IN WAIT FOR DAYS 
THIS LANGUR MONKEY IS TRANSFIXED BY HER REFLECTION IN THE LENS 
THESE SPY CAMS ARE NOW DEPLOYED TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS RECORDING EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN FRONT OF THEM 
EVEN THOUGH SOME SEE THROUGH THEIR DISGUISE THE CAMERAS BETWEEN THEM 
CAPTURE A WEALTH OF EXTRAORDINARY BEHAVIOUR 
SPOTTED DEER AND LANGURS FIND SAFETY IN NUMBERS AND OFTEN TRAVEL AROUND TOGETHER 
LOG CAM REVEALS JUST HOW UNRULY 
THE DEER'S NEIGHBOURS CAN BE 
DESPITE THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE SHARING SENTRY DUTIES MAKES SENSE 
WHEN A TIGER'S ON THE PROWL 
TIME TO GET BABY ON BOARD 
WITH EYES EVERYWHERE THERE IS LITERALLY 
NOWHERE TO HIDE 
THEY HAVE A SPECIAL ALARM CALL FOR TIGER AND IT'S NEVER TOO YOUNG TO LEARN ITS MEANING 
THESE INCESSANT CALLS FOLLOW THE TIGRESS WHEREVER SHE GOES 
MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR HER TO LAUNCH A SURPRISE ATTACK 
WITH A TIGER IN THEIR MIDST MONKEYS HAVE AT LEAST ONE WAY TO SHOW THEIR DISGUST 
AS SOON AS THE TIGERS RELAX THE EXCITEMENT BEGINS TO DIE DOWN 
THE TIGERS ARE USED TO PLAYING A WAITING GAME 
THE FOREST GRADUALLY QUIETENS 
ITS INHABITANTS LIVE UNDER CONSTANT THREAT FROM TIGERS 
SO THEY MUST MAKE THE MOST OF ANY PERIODS OF CALM 
THIS IS THE MOMENT THE TIGRESS HAS BEEN WAITING FOR 
LANGURS ARE STRICT VEGETARIANS 
AND NOW IN THE MONSOON THERE IS FOOD EVERYWHERE 
WITH PLENTY OF TIME ON THEIR HANDS THEIR GUARD IS DOWN 
ANY FILM OF TIGERS HUNTING IS RARE 
AND FORESTS ARE VERY DIFFICULT LOCATIONS BECAUSE THE VEGETATION OBSCURES THE VIEW 
BUT THE ELEPHANT CAMS CAN FILM EVEN IN THE DEEPEST FOREST 
WATER HOLES MAKE THE PERFECT SPOT FOR AN AMBUSH 
TIGERS SEIZE ANY HUNTING OPPORTUNITY 
BUT IF THEY ARE UNDISTURBED THEY PREFER TO HUNT IN THE DAY 
THE JUNGLE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM IS BACK IN OPERATION 
THE CALLS PUT THE WHOLE FOREST ON EDGE AND MAKE THE TIGRESS' JOB MORE DIFFICULT 
FACED WITH A CHOICE SHE FAVOURS THE LARGER SAMBAR DEER 
BUT THE MONKEY ALARMS ARE MAKING THEM NERVOUS 
AS DEER HAVE POOR COLOUR VISION A TIGER CAN BE WITHIN 
SNIFFING DISTANCE BUT STILL BE UNSEEN IN THE GRASS 
SHE RELIES ON HER CAMOUFLAGE WHICH BREAKS UP HER OUTLINE 
BUT IN THE MIDST OF THE HERD MANY EYES ARE WATCHING 
THE SAMBAR SIGNALS HER UNEASE TO HER COMPANIONS 
BUT SHE'S STILL UNSURE OF WHAT SHE SEES 
ALL SEEMS LOST 
BUT IN THICK FOREST THE TIGRESS STILL HAS EVERYTHING TO PLAY FOR 
SHE USES THE RIVER VALLEYS AS COVER TO CUT OFF THE DEER'S ESCAPE 
DEER CALL 
FOR THE DEER OUT OF SIGHT IS OUT OF MIND 
SHE'S REGAINED THE ADVANTAGE OF SURPRISE 
WHEN RUNNING SHE CAN COVER NINE METRES IN EACH LEAP 
BUT EVEN SO THE CLOSER SHE CAN GET THE BETTER 
SHE GETS IT 
SHE KILLS BY THROTTLING 
IF THE PREY IS SMALL ENOUGH SHE'LL CARRY IT BACK TO HER CUBS 
BUT AFTER A LONG HUNT THEY CAN BE QUITE A DISTANCE AWAY 
SHE IS ALREADY HAVING TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF KILLS SHE MAKES 
FOR THE CUBS HAVE DEVELOPED QUITE AN APPETITE 
THE CUBS ARE NOW FOURTEEN WEEKS OLD AND NEED ALL THE MEAT THEY CAN GET 
THEY CAN EAT OVER A KILO OF MEAT EACH DAY THE EQUIVALENT OF TWENTY LARGE STEAKS BETWEEN THEM 
IT'S JUST AS WELL PENCH RESERVE HAS SUCH A THRIVING POPULATION OF PREY ANIMALS 
BECAUSE OF ITS VALUE AS A SANCTUARY FOR TIGERS 
THIS OLD TEAK FORESTRY PLANTATION WAS MADE A RESERVE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
AND NOW IT HAS MANY OTHER SECRETIVE INHABITANTS AS THE SPY CAMS DISCOVER 
A FAMILY OF WILD BOAR 
LEFT TO RECORD ALL DAY 
IT'S SURPRISING JUST WHAT THE SPY CAMS CAPTURE 
WHO WOULD THINK THAT A POND HERON FACES COMPETITION FROM A KINGFISHER 
EVEN LANGURS HAVE TO KEEP THEIR DISTANCE 
AS WELL AS CAPTURING UNUSUAL BEHAVIOUR OF OTHER ANIMALS 
THE SPY CAMS ARE ABLE TO FILM THE TIGERS WHEN THE ELEPHANTS ARE OFF DUTY 
A PAINTED SPURFOWL MAKES AN ENTRANCE AND AN EQUALLY QUICK EXIT 
THE CUBS MAY BE GAINING IN CONFIDENCE IN DEALING WITH THE SMALLER INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST 
BUT THEY'RE FAR FROM KINGS OF THIS JUNGLE 
THEIR INQUISITIVE NATURE GETS THEM INTO ALL SORTS OF SCRAPES 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEIR MOTHER'S TAKING A NAP 
INDIAN ROCK PYTHONS WILL EAT SMALL CUBS 
THEY ALSO FREQUENT THE KIND OF ROCKY OUTCROPS WHERE TIGERS MAKE THEIR DENS 
AT THIS AGE THE CUBS ARE STILL AN EASY MEAL FOR EVERY PREDATOR AROUND 
IT WILL BE NEARLY TWO YEARS BEFORE THEY BECOME AS FORMIDABLE AS THEIR MOTHER 
VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE SEEN HOW AN ADULT TIGER DEALS WITH A PYTHON 
WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME 
ALTHOUGH THE PYTHON ISN'T PROTECTED BY VENOM IT DOES HAVE A NASTY BITE 
THEY SAY CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT 
TIGERS AREN'T USED TO ANIMALS THAT BITE BACK 
FILMING SO MUCH EXTRAORDINARY TIGER BEHAVIOUR IN SUCH A SHORT TIME 
HAS BEEN A TRIUMPH 
BUT IT'S TIME FOR THE ELEPHANTS TO TAKE ANOTHER BREAK 
THEY WILL BE AWAY FOR ANOTHER TWO MONTHS 
IT'S NOW DECEMBER 
THE ELEPHANTS HAVE BEEN BACK ON DUTY FOR FIVE DAYS 
BUT SO FAR THEY HAVEN'T FOUND THE MOTHER AND CUBS 
THEN TUSK CAM SPOTS THE FAMILY 
THE CUBS ARE NOW FIVE MONTHS OLD AND ALL SEEM IN PERFECT HEALTH 
TUSK CAM HAS A STABILISED CAMERA SYSTEM BUT WHEN THE ELEPHANT STOPS HE OFTEN ADDS HIS OWN SUPPORT 
TURNING HIS TRUNK INTO A MONOPOD WHICH STEADIES THE CAMERA'S IMAGE 
BUT THE MOST ROCK SOLID SHOTS COME FROM TRUNK CAM 
OFF THE ELEPHANT ALTOGETHER AND WORKING FROM THE GROUND 
AS THE TIGERS RELAX AND TRUNK CAM TAKES OVER 
THE ELEPHANT THAT CARRIES TUSK CAM CAN ALSO TAKE A BREAK 
TIGERS SPEND AROUND TWENTY HOURS EACH DAY CAT NAPPING 
THE ELEPHANTS ALSO APPRECIATE THEIR DOWNTIME AND PATIENTLY WAIT FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN 
IN FACT MOST OF THE FILMING DAY IS SPENT JUST WAITING 
THEN TRUNK CAM SPOTS SOMETHING THAT COULD DISTURB THE PEACE 
A PANGOLIN HAS BLUNDERED INTO THE TIGER'S LAIR 
DESPITE HIS REPTILIAN LIKE SCALES 
THIS RARE CREATURE IS ACTUALLY A MAMMAL 
BUT HIS ARMOURED PLATES PROVIDE LITTLE PROTECTION AGAINST TIGERS 
THE PANGOLIN SENSES DANGER AND ROLLS INTO A PROTECTIVE BALL 
IT'S EASY TO BE BRAVE WHEN MUM'S AROUND 
ESPECIALLY AS PART OF THEIR EDUCATION IS TO INVESTIGATE EVERYTHING THAT MOVES 
BUT EVEN WITH SOME HEFTY REINFORCEMENTS AVAILABLE BRAVERY IS BEST TEMPERED WITH CAUTION 
IT PAYS TO LOOK DIFFERENT 
THE PANGOLIN'S STRANGE APPEARANCE HAS PROVED MORE EFFECTIVE THAN HIS ARMOUR 
THE INDIAN JUNGLE HIDES OTHER RARELY SEEN CREATURES TOO 
THE SLOTH BEAR IS THE ONLY BEAR TO CARRY HER YOUNG ON HER BACK 
HITCHING A RIDE MAKES SENSE 
THE CUBS' MOTHER MAY TRAVEL TEN MILES A DAY LOOKING FOR THE NESTS OF BEES AND TERMITES 
AS WELL AS EATING INSECTS THE BEARS ARE MAINLY VEGETARIANS SO THIS PALM SQUIRREL HAS LITTLE TO FEAR 
THE CUBS SCAVENGE FOR EASIER PICKINGS AMONGST THE ROCKS 
FILM OF WILD SLOTH BEARS IS RARE BUT GETTING AS CLOSE AS THIS IS VERY RARE INDEED 
THESE BEARS ARE SELDOM SEEN IN THE DAY SO THEY'RE OFTEN DESCRIBED AS NOCTURNAL 
ONLY IN UNDISTURBED PLACES LIKE THIS DOES THEIR TRUE NATURE BECOME APPARENT 
HER SHAGGY COAT NOT ONLY GIVES HER YOUNG HITCHHIKERS SOMETHING TO CLING ONTO 
IT ALSO PROTECTS HER AGAINST ATTACKS BY THE STINGING INSECTS WHOSE NESTS SHE RAIDS FOR FOOD 
AS THEY GET BIGGER THE CUBS HAVE TO TAKE TURNS HITCHING A RIDE 
MONGOOSE ARE COMMON IN THE MORE OPEN AREAS OF THE FOREST 
BUT THEY'RE STILL UNUSUAL ENOUGH TO FASCINATE THE CUBS 
IT MUST BE DIFFICULT SCRATCHING AN ITCH 
WHEN YOU'RE WEARING A FULL LENGTH FUR COAT 
HER CUBS ARE SIX MONTHS OLD 
AND SHE'LL CARRY THEM FOR ANOTHER THREE MONTHS 
THEY'RE ALREADY BIG ENOUGH TO BE A NUISANCE 
EVEN THE BEST MOTHERS NEED TO TAKE TIME OUT AND THIS ONE'S YOUNGSTERS ARE DOUBLE TROUBLE 
THE SLOTH BEAR ISN'T THE ONLY ONE WITH PARENTAL PROBLEMS 
THE TIGRESS HAS HER OWN BOISTEROUS CUBS TO COPE WITH 
THEY'RE NOW CONFIRMED CARNIVORES AND EAGERLY FEED ON EVERY KILL 
A LONE TIGER WILL KILL AROUND ONCE EVERY EIGHT DAYS 
BUT WITH HUNGRY MOUTHS TO FEED SHE HAS TO INCREASE HER HIT RATE 
FOUR CUBS PRESENT A SPECIAL CHALLENGE 
AN ADULT TIGER ON ITS OWN CAN EAT THIRTY KILOS OF MEAT IN A SINGLE MEAL 
SO EVEN A LARGE CARCASS CAN LEAVE LITTLE TO GO ROUND 
THE CUBS TAKE WHAT THEY CAN IN A SINGLE SITTING 
THEY CAN NEVER BE SURE WHEN THE NEXT MEAL MIGHT ARRIVE 
EVEN IF THEIR MOTHER CAN KEEP UP WITH THEIR DEMAND NOW THINGS ARE ONLY GOING TO GET MORE DIFFICULT 
THEY NEED THEIR STRENGTH 
AT THIS AGE THEY STILL FACE MANY UNEXPECTED DANGERS 
THE SLOTH BEAR HAS A REPUTATION FOR USING ATTACK AS ITS FIRST LINE OF DEFENCE 
THE OUTCOME OF THIS ENCOUNTER IS UNCERTAIN 
THE TIGER'S ADVANCE IS CAUTIOUS 
ANY ANIMAL THAT HOLDS ITS GROUND IS SOMETHING TO BE WARY OF 
IT'S A STAND OFF 
NEITHER SEEMS QUITE SURE WHAT TO DO 
THE BEAR'S NERVE BREAKS FIRST 
TO CAPTURE SUCH BEHAVIOUR IS A GREAT STROKE OF LUCK BUT WITH SO MANY CAMERAS DEPLOYED 
AT ANY ONE TIME THERE ARE ALWAYS PLENTY OF SURPRISES 
ANOTHER LEOPARD WITH CUBS SPOTS HER REFLECTION IN THE LENS OF THE SPY CAM 
SHE QUICKLY REALISES THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 
AND HER FIVE WEEK OLD CUBS ARE REASSURED BY HER CONFIDENCE 
FEW LEOPARD CUBS AS YOUNG AS THIS HAVE EVER BEEN FILMED BEFORE 
LET ALONE SO CLOSE AND SO AT EASE 
THE CAMERAS ARE LEFT FOR DAYS AT A TIME 
AND THEY RECORD MANY ELUSIVE AND INTIMATE MOMENTS 
HER CUBS WILL STAY WITH HER FOR JUST OVER A YEAR 
BEFORE THEY'RE OLD ENOUGH TO FIND TERRITORIES OF THEIR OWN 
TIGER CUBS STAY WITH THEIR MOTHER FOR FAR LONGER 
THE EARLIEST A MALE CUB MIGHT LEAVE IS AT TWENTY MONTHS OLD 
BUT THE FEMALE CUBS MAY STAY AROUND FOR AS MUCH AS TWO YEARS 
ALL IN ALL THEY HAVE A LOT OF LEARNING AHEAD OF THEM 
THEY HAVE TO HONE THEIR HUNTING SKILLS AND THE SPOTTED DEER FAWN PROVIDES THEM WITH GOOD PRACTICE 
LEARNING TO DRAG A CARCASS IS NOT JUST A GAME 
ADULT TIGERS LIKE TO EAT THEIR KILLS IN COVER AWAY FROM SCAVENGING BIRDS 
THE SUCCESS OF THE CUBS IN THE MONTHS TO COME 
WILL DEPEND ON HOW WELL THEY LEARN FROM WATCHING THEIR MOTHER 
MEAT IS NOW THE MAJOR PART OF THEIR DIET ALTHOUGH THEY WILL STILL SUCKLE IF GIVEN A CHANCE 
BUT AT THIS AGE 
THEIR MOTHER CAN FIND THEIR SHARP TEETH QUITE PAINFUL 
IT'S NOT ONLY THE CUBS THAT ARE UNSETTLING THE TIGRESS 
THE DAY IS WARMING UP FAST AND IT'S MAKING HER RESTLESS 
THE MIDDAY HEAT AFFECTS EVERYONE 
IT EVEN DRAWS ONE OF INDIA'S RAREST ANIMALS TO THE WATER HOLE 
THE RED DOG OR DHOLE 
RED DOGS ONCE FORMED LARGE HUNTING PACKS OVER ONE HUNDRED STRONG 
TODAY EVEN THESE SMALL FAMILY GROUPS ARE A RARE SIGHT 
A LARGE PACK CAN EVEN KILL A TIGER 
LIKE MOST DOGS THEY ARE INTELLIGENT AND INQUISITIVE 
ONE OF THEM FINDS THE CAMERA 
THE ELEPHANT CREW FACE SOME SERIOUS COMPETITION 
GAUR ANOTHER RARE ANIMAL ARE ALSO DRAWN TO THE WATERHOLE 
ONLY ONE THOUSAND OF THESE WILD CATTLE ARE LEFT IN INDIA 
THEY TRAVEL IN SMALL HERDS LED BY A DOMINANT MALE 
LIKE MOST PREY ANIMALS THEY'RE EASILY SPOOKED BY THE APPROACH OF A PREDATOR 
LEOPARDS TAKE PRIDE OF PLACE AT THE WATERING HOLE 
BUT EVEN THEY DEFER TO A TIGER 
THE TIGER IS TWICE HER SIZE BUT THE LEOPARD'S AGILITY GIVES HER THE EDGE 
A TREE PROVIDES A QUICK ESCAPE ROUTE BUT THE TIGER ISN'T EASILY DEFEATED 
NOW THE TIGER'S SIZE IS ACTUALLY HER HANDICAP 
THE LEOPARD JUST HAS TO SIT IT OUT 
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR LONG 
IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY A TIGER HAS BETTER THINGS TO DO 
AT THE HOTTEST TIME OF THE DAY SHE HAS JUST ONE THING ON HER MIND 
TIGERS ARE THE ONLY BIG CATS THAT LIKE WATER 
IN THE SUMMER MONTHS A JUNGLE POOL REALLY IS COOL FOR THESE CATS 
THEY OFTEN SPEND THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY JUST CHILLING OUT IN FAVOURITE SPOTS LIKE THIS 
CHASING LEOPARDS IS THIRSTY WORK 
BUT HER RIVAL IS NOW FAR FROM THE TIGER'S MIND 
THE LEOPARD WILL NOT FORGET SO EASILY 
SHE'S RECEIVED A POWERFUL WARNING 
HER CUBS ARE TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT 
AS SHE LEAVES SHE CATCHES ONE LAST GLIMPSE OF HER REFLECTION 
TIGERS CAN BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE HEAT A TRAIT THAT SUGGESTS 
THAT THEY ORIGINATED IN MUCH COLDER REGIONS 
THEY CAN STILL BE FOUND AS FAR NORTH AS SIBERIA 
DESPITE THE HEAT THE TIGERS IN PENCH SEEM TO HAVE FOUND THEIR OWN BIT OF PARADISE 
IN THE OPEN FOREST 
THE DEER'S CONSTANT GRAZING CREATES AREAS OF PARK LIKE GRASSLAND 
THESE PASTURES MAKE THE BEST HUNTING GROUNDS 
AT THIS AGE THE CUBS SOMETIMES FOLLOW THEIR MOTHER WHEN SHE HUNTS 
BY WATCHING AND COPYING THEY LEARN HER TECHNIQUES 
AS SHE SELECTS A TARGET THEY TRY OUT SOME MOVES OF THEIR OWN 
BUT THEY MUST ALSO LEARN THAT THIS IS A TIME FOR PATIENCE 
THEY INSTINCTIVELY ADOPT THE STALKING POSTURE 
BUT THEY REFINE THEIR TECHNIQUE BY COPYING THEIR MOTHER 
A TIGER CAN COVER NEARLY A METRE AND A HALF IN A SINGLE STRIDE 
EVEN WHEN SHE'S WALKING SLOWLY THE CUBS HAVE TROUBLE KEEPING UP 
WITH THE DEER SO CLOSE THE STAKES ARE HIGH 
THE CUBS SEEM TO BE MAKING ALL THE RIGHT MOVES 
THE TIGRESS IS NOW WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE 
BUT THE DEER KNOWS SOMETHING IS UP 
THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO LOSE YOUR NERVE 
LESSONS ARE BEING LEARNED THE HARD WAY BUT THE CUBS NOW KNOW WHEN TO LEAVE IT TO THE EXPERT 
THIS TIME THE TIGRESS LEAVES HER STUDENTS BEHIND 
THE DEEP COVER ALLOWS HER TO MOVE FASTER THAN USUAL 
SHE CHANGES TACK 
HER BEST WEAPON IS SURPRISE 
SHE COULD BE ANYWHERE 
SHE KILLS JUST TWO METRES FROM THE CAMERA ELEPHANT 
IT'S A SAMBAR 
PLENTY OF FOOD TO GO ROUND 
TIGERS OFTEN PLUCK THEIR PREY BEFORE EATING IT 
A HABIT THEY SHARE WITH LEOPARDS 
TAKING THE CARCASS INTO COVER WILL CONCEAL IT FROM SCAVENGERS 
THE CUBS IMMEDIATELY SHOW HOW QUICKLY THEY LEARN FROM THEIR MOTHER 
HE'S ALREADY MAKING QUITE A GOOD JOB OF REMOVING THE HAIR 
BUT IT'S A BIG CARCASS AND THERE ARE OTHER HUNTING MOVES TO PRACTICE 
AND THIS IS A GAME IN WHICH OTHERS CAN JOIN 
THE CUBS' PLAY IS BECOMING MORE AGGRESSIVE 
THEY ARE ALREADY SHOWING THE QUALITIES THAT WILL MAKE THEM ONE OF THE WORLD'S TOP PREDATORS 
HAVING WATCHED THEM PROGRESS SO FAR 
IT SEEMS A GOOD TIME TO TAKE A FILMING BREAK 
SHOOTING RESUMES IN MAY 
NEITHER THE CUBS NOR THEIR MOTHER HAVE BEEN SEEN FOR DAYS 
THE CAMERA TEAM INVESTIGATE 
SPY CAMS ARE PLACED NEAR ALL THEIR FAVOURITE DEN SITES 
JUST A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT IS NEEDED 
THIS WAS A GOOD CHOICE THE CUBS USE THE SHADE AND WET SAND BESIDES THE BOULDER TO SHELTER FROM THE HEAT 
BUT WORRYINGLY THERE IS NO SIGN OF THE MOTHER 
A SECOND CAMERA IN A NEARBY POND FINDS ONLY THE OTHER CUBS 
THIS SPY CAM IS CAMOUFLAGED TO RESEMBLE ONE OF THE BOULDERS BUT THE CUBS SEES THROUGH ITS DISGUISE 
DESPITE OCCASIONALLY BEING SPOTTED THE SPY CAMS HAVE ALREADY PROVED THEIR WORTH 
EVEN THIS CUB QUICKLY LOSES ITS CURIOSITY 
A THIRD HIDDEN CAMERA SHOWS THAT PLAY BETWEEN THE CUBS 
IS INCREASINGLY GEARED TO FIGHTING AND HUNTING 
EVEN A STICK IS USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PREY 
THE SPY CAM ALSO SHOWS JUST HOW ALERT THE CUBS ARE TO DANGER WHEN THEY'RE ALONE 
THEY'VE PICKED UP THE ALARM CALLS OF MONKEYS A PREDATOR 
MUST BE APPROACHING AND THEY SEEM TO KNOW IT'S NOT THEIR MOTHER 
THEIR NEARBY DEN PROVIDES THEM WITH COVER 
BUT WITH THEIR MOTHER NOWHERE TO BE SEEN THIS IS A WORRYING SITUATION 
THE SPY CAM REVEALS THE THREAT 
IT'S THEIR ARCH RIVAL A LEOPARD AT THEIR WATER HOLE 
THESE HOME ALONE CUBS ARE NOW IN GRAVE DANGER 
AND THE LEOPARD IS IN NO RUSH TO LEAVE 
IN THE NEXT SPY IN THE JUNGLE WE WILL SEE HOW THE CUBS FARED 
IN THIS LATEST CHALLENGE TO THEIR YOUNG LIVES 
OUR ELEPHANT CAMERA CREW WILL ALSO REVEAL MANY OTHER REMARKABLE MOMENTS IN A TIGER'S LIFE
