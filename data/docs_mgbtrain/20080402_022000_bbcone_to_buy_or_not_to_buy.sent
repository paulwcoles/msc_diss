THIS'D BE THE OH 
SO WE'LL GO IN THE OTHER WAY MASTER BEDROOM AND WE'LL GO THROUGH HERE 
EN SUITE YEAH EN SUITE FIREPLACE 
YEAH THERE'S A FIREPLACE 
YEAH THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING IN THERE SO THAT'LL BE WORTH GETTING INTO 
THIS IS THE SMALLEST HOUSE WE'VE SHOWN TODAY 
IT IS BUT IT DOES HAVE THE MOST LAND TO IT 
IT'LL ONLY LEAVE US WITH TWO BEDROOMS TWO BEDROOMS 
SO THEN WE'RE GOING TO POSSIBLY LOOK TO EXTEND 
SO YEAH IT COULD BE A PRICEY JOB BUT THE POTENTIAL IS HERE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S EXCITING ABOUT THIS GO ON THEY'RE WILLING TO DO STUFF TO IT AND SO AM I 
I THINK TOGETHER WE COULD MAKE THEM A GREAT HOME I'M GONNA CONCENTRATE WITH SIMO ON THE VEG ASPECT 
I WANT YOU AND MIKE TO GET IN THERE AND START KNOCKING THINGS DOWN

ALL THE GARDENERS OUT THERE GETTING THAT ALL LANDSCAPED AND EVERYTHING 
GARDENERS I LIKE IT I'D BE THE FOREMAN COMING IN TO MAKE SURE THE WORK'S GOING ON 
BUT OPEN WITH THE WINDOWS HERE LOTS AND LOTS OF LIGHT COMING IN O. K. 
AND THEN I'D HAVE UNITS GOING ROUND HERE AND THEN I'D HAVE A STOVE AREA COMING ROUND HERE 
THIS WILL ALL BE ON ONE LEVEL THEN WE COULD HAVE THE TABLE AND CHAIRS HERE 
BUT EVERYTHING WORKING ON THAT SIDE SO WE'RE LOOKING OUT TO THE VIEWS CONSTANTLY I LOVE THE IDEA 
POSSIBLE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER STOREY ON TOP MAYBE GOING INTO THERE 
YOU'VE ONLY GOT TWO BEDROOMS YEAH IT'S ONLY TWO BEDROOMS 
YEAH GOOD THINKING DEFINITELY GET ANOTHER BEDROOM UP THERE THE QUESTION IS IS THE PRICE TAG HUGE 
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SHOWING YOU SUCH A PIGSTY 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT BECAUSE THERE IT IS

SO YOU'VE GOT ROLLING FIELDS YOU'VE GOT GREAT BIG HEIFERS OUT THERE IMAGE THAT 
I JUST KIND OF LIKE THE WHOLE COUNTRYSIDE VIBE DO YOU 
DO YOU I DO WHAT ABOUT YOU 
IT'S A LOVELY HOUSE ON THE OUTSIDE BUT ON THE INSIDE NO 
COME ON YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE OUTSIDE LET MIKE WORRY ABOUT THE INTERIOR 
I KNOW IT'S LOOKING A BIT ROUGH AND READY BUT THINK OF WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH ALL OF THIS LAND 
IF I JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS 
SO MUCH POTENTIAL FOR THE DOGS THE HORSES THE STABLES THE HERBS THE GARDENS YEAH 
THIS IS ACTUALLY AN AMAZING PROJECT 
YEAH I MEAN I CAN IMAGINE THIS BEING BEAUTIFULLY LANDSCAPED 
YEAH BUT YOU JUST KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE SHEDDING TEARS IN THE PROCESS THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
WELL WHY DON'T WE FIND OUT HOW MUCH THIS COSTS 
AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY MONEY LEFT IN THE KITTY TO DO IT UP OR NOT O. K. THEN O. K. 
THE THIRD AND FINAL GUESS THE PRICE TIME 
IT'S NECK AND NECK SO THIS IS GONNA SORT THE MEN FROM THE BOYS UH HUH 
OH YES ERM RIGHT YOUR MAXIMUM BUDGET OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY FOR THAT 
I WOULD SAY TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY INTERESTING RIGHT GO ON 
I WAS GOING TO SAY TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
RIGHT WE'RE REALLY NEAR TO LUDLOW AND IT'S QUITE POSH IS THIS YOU TRYING TO SOFTEN THE PRICE 
YES YES IT IS ME TRYING TO SOFTEN IT OFFERS AROUND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IT'S A UNIQUE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT REALLY NEAR TO LUDLOW 
GREAT LUMP OF LAND REMOTE VERY DESIRABLE LOCATION 
REALLY NEAR TO LUDLOW REALLY NEAR TO LUDLOW GREAT COWS OVER THERE

OH YOU DON'T NEED YOUR IMAGINATION NOW BECAUSE HERE IS A QUICK RECAP 
OF THOSE THREE PROPERTIES FOR YOU AT HOME 
NOW YOU MAY HAVE ALL MOCKED THE PRICE OF HOUSE ONE BUT LET ME 
REMIND YOU THAT AFTER SEEING YOUR PLACE MIKE AND SIMO MUST SURELY HAVE COME TO THEIR SENSES 
AND NOW CAN'T WAIT TO TEST DRIVE THIS FOUR BEDROOMED COTTAGE IN EDGETON 
IT'S GOT FIVE RECEPTION ROOMS A CINEMA ROOM A POOL ROOM AND 
A MUSIC STUDIO FOR SIMO 
AND IT'S ALL THEIRS FOR THREE NINETY FIVE K. 
YOU DIDN'T MAKE MIKE GO ALL WEAK AT THE KNEES LIKE I DID WHEN HE SAW THE KITCHEN AT PROPERTY TWO 
WITH ITS TOP OF THE RANGE RANGE 
IT OFFERS THEM EVERYTHING THEY BOTH NEED AND IT'S IN STAGGERING DISTANCE OF TWO PUBS 
ALL FOR THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT 
THEY MIGHT JUST IGNORE PROPERTIES ONE AND TWO AND GO FOR THE WILDCARD 
THE THREE BEDROOMED COTTAGE IN STANTON LACEY COULD BE JUST 
THE PROJECT THEY'RE AFTER AND THAT BARN COULD END UP BEING THE KITCHEN LOOKING ON TO THESE AMAZING VIEWS 
YEP AND THINK OF WHAT THEY COULD DO WITH ALL THAT LAND WRAPPED AROUND THE COTTAGE 
IT TICKED ALL THE BOXES 
AND EVEN THE GUIDE PRICE 
WAS JUST ABOUT RIGHT AT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
WELL ITS TIME TO REVEAL WHICH PROPERTY WE HAVE CHOSEN TO 
TEST DRIVE TODAY AND WITH A SPRING IN MY STEP AND A SWING IN MY ARMS IT'S CLEAR TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN

HE WOULD HAVE STAYED AND HAD A CHAT WITH YOU BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE LIKED HIM HE'S A STAR WARS FAN 
BUT HE'S TOLD ME ONE OR TWO INTERESTING THINGS 
THE MYSTERY TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY SURVEYOR CAME HERE AND HE LOOKED AT THE ROOF 
TO US A NORMAL ROOF BUT HE SPOTTED IT'S IMITATION SLATE 
BUT THE LIFE EXPECTANCY ISN'T OBVIOUSLY AS LONG AS IT WOULD BE IF IT WAS REAL SLATE O. K. 
BOYS WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR REAR END OF THE PROPERTY
