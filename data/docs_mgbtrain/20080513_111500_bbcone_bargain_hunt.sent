HI JAMES WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS JAMES 
ROBERTA WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT WEDGWOOD 
NOT MUCH IT JUST LOOKS NICE DIFFERENT PRETTY NICE ON THE EYE 
IT IS YEAH JOSHUA WEDGWOOD FATHER OF POTTERY AND PORCELAIN 
MADE A FORTUNE FROM CREAM WARE AVOIDING EXCISE TAX THAT'S HOW HE MADE HIS FORTUNE 
BUT IT'S VERY NICE WITH THIS ACANTHUS LEAF MOULDING HERE 
THIS IS QUITE POROUS IT'S A HARD STONE WARE 
A RATHER NICE VICTORY LAUREL WREATH ROUND HERE 
THERE ARE VICTORIOUS ELEMENTS HERE IT WAS A GUNG HO TIME OF ACHIEVEMENT AND INDUSTRY 
THIS IS ALL TO DO WITH HERCULANEUM POMPEII BEING EXCAVATED HOW OLD DO YOU THINK IT IS 
WE'VE GOT NO MADE IN ENGLAND THAT WAS TO DO WITH INTERNATIONAL TARIFFS ALL ABOUT TAX 
EVERYTHING'S ABOUT TAX THAT WAS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE SO IT'S PRE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE 
WHAT ABOUT DAMAGE WHY IS IT TWENTY FIVE 
WE'VE GOT A LITTLE CHIP ON THE SPOUT A TINY LITTLE CHIP NOT SO GOOD 
A COUPLE ON THIS AS WELL WHAT ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER YEAH WELL 
THERE'S A BIT OF THE FACE OFF MAN DOWN 
BUT WE'RE STILL KEEN TO BUY THEM YES BECAUSE THIS IS BARGAIN HUNT 
NOTHING WILL GET IN OUR WAY 
CHARLIE AND ROBERTA HAVE STRUCK FIRST AND BAGGED A BRACE OF WEDGWOOD FOR FORTY 
THAT IS A VERY DESCRIPTIVE LABEL OLD BOX 
KNOW WHAT A. F. STANDS FOR NO IDEA IT'S AS FOUND OR ALL FAULTS AND THIS HAS SOME 
I MEAN LOOK AT IT STUCK TOGETHER WITH SELLOTAPE THAT'S ELIZABETHAN 
WHAT KIND OF WOOD IS THAT THAT IS MADE OF MAHOGANY RIGHT 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON IT WAS USED FOR POSSIBLY A TEA CADDY 
THE BOY'S A GENIUS HE SPENDS ALL DAY DRINKING TEA GUESS THE DATE 
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
THESE BOYS ARE GOOD AREN'T THEY ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON 
THIS IS A GEORGIAN TEA CADDY WE'LL OPEN IT UP AND INSIDE 
WE MIGHT HOPE TO FIND A DIVISION AND TWO LITTLE LIDS 
I SUSPECT FOR SIX QUID WHICH IS THE PRICE ON THE TICKET WE MIGHT NOT DISCOVER THAT 
AND LO AND BEHOLD THERE WE ARE 
SO WE'LL TAKE THAT OUT 
YOU CAN SEE THESE GROOVES HERE WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A DIVISION 
BUT THAT LOCK THERE TEA WAS VALUABLE IN THE GEORGIAN ERA 
IT WAS LOCKED UP TO STOP THE SERVANTS FROM PINCHING IT AND IT'S WRECKED IT NEEDS T. L. C. 
IF YOU GIVE IT TO THE RIGHT PERSON HE COULD RESTORE IT 
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IN AN ANTIQUE MADE OUT OF WOOD IS SPLITS THERE'S NO SPLITS HERE THINGS MISSING 
BUT THERE'S NO SPLITS WHAT IT NEEDS IS THE TOP REGLUING 
IT NEEDS A NEW MOULDING BAR ALONG THERE AND THERE 
ALL THE WAY ALONG THERE THAT'S THE ONLY DECENT MOULDING 
IT WOULD BE EASY TO GET BEADING SPOT ON AND IT'S GOT A NICE COLOUR 
THIS IS A GOOD PATINA IT'LL POLISH UP LOVELY WHAT'S IT WORTH THEN 
WELL IT'S GOT TO BE WORTH SIX QUID THESE ARE A LITTLE OUT OF FAVOUR 
NOW TEN YEARS AGO A BOX LIKE THAT IN GOOD ORDER PROPERLY FITTED OUT 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY AND THEY'VE COME TUMBLING DOWN AS FASHIONS CHANGE 
PEOPLE DON'T WANT THESE NOW THEY WANT ACTION MAN TOYS 
BUT AT SIX QUID IT'S A GIFT WHAT'S THE PROFIT DO YOU THINK WE CAN MAKE MONEY ABSOLUTELY 
SURE FIRE GUARANTEE ON PRINCIPLE TRY TO GET THE PRICE DOWN BUT IT'S A PROFIT DEFINITELY 
YOU'RE BUYING A PROFIT I'LL TRY TO GET A COUPLE OF POUNDS OFF IT 
IF YOU GET MORE THAN SIX QUID OFF YOU'RE A GENIUS MORE LIKE TIGHTWADS 
FIVE SPENT SO TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE LEFT 
EVER WONDERED HOW TO SPOT THE HOTTEST BARGAINS EASY 
LOG ON TO OUR WEBSITE 
AND LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR ANNIGONI AND YOUR ZUCCARELLI 
COME ON STOP LARKING AROUND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS VERY FINE BASIN I HAVE FOUND 
THAT'S A BIT NICE YOU LIKE IT YEAH NOW WE WENT FOR THE SLIGHTLY WEDGWOOD GREEN DIDN'T WE YES 
WHAT ABOUT BLUE AND WHITE IT'S A TRADITIONAL THING EUROPE FELL IN LOVE WITH CHINESE PORCELAIN 
THIS IS COBALT BLUE LOVELY ELEMENTS NICE IDEALISED LANDSCAPE 
NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR SORT OF LAKE COMO MEETS MOUNT FUJI REALLY 
WE'VE GOT THIS RATHER NICE TEMPLE OF VENUS 
AND THIS LOVELY GRAND TOUR VASE WITH LOVELY GRECIAN LADIES HERE 
THIS IS TRANSFER NOT VERY WELL DONE NOT APPLIED VERY WELL 
IT'S GOT A CREASE THERE TRANSFER DECORATION CAME IN AS A GREAT PROCESS IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
THIS ISN'T LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY NO MARKS ON IT 
IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE MANY STAFFORDSHIRE POTTERIES AND WOULD COME WITH A JUG 
SO A BASIN USED FOR HAND WASHING 
WHAT PRICE ARE WE LOOKING AT THEN UNFORTUNATELY IT'S PRICED AT FIFTY TWO I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND FIFTY TWO 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD GET THIS DOWN TO ABOUT THIRTY THIRTY FIVE 
O. K. I WILL GO AND DO BATTLE DO IT FOR YOUR COUNTRY 
JAMES WON HIS BATTLE AND CAPTURED THE BOWL FOR THIRTY TWO 
WHAT ABOUT THIS BOAT I THINK IT'S GONNA SINK I LIKE THAT THOUGH THAT'S DAFT 
IT'S CLEARLY A MALLET THAT LOOKS LIKE A PIECE OF BOXWOOD 
EACH SIDE IS A MODERN MAHOGANY BLOCK OR REPLACEMENT IT'S REALLY HEAVY 
THAT'S BRASS BRONZE WHATEVER FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THAT 
THAT DOES HURT ACTUALLY THAT IS REALLY A LITTLE BIT TOO BIG 
YOU'D CRACK YOUR NUTS WITH IT AT CHRISTMAS 
I WONDER IF IT'S WHAT A SAILMAKER WOULD USE WHEN YOU'RE MAKING SAILS SPLITTING ROPES THEY HAVE FIGS 
MARLIN SPIKES WE CALL THEM IN THE NAVY FOR SPLITTING ROPES 
YOU PUT THAT BETWEEN THE STRANDS AND SPLIT THEM TO RESPLICE THEM 
THESE BOYS ARE GOOD AND YOU DRIVE THOSE BETWEEN THE STRANDS TO SPLIT THE ROPE 
SO YOU CAN THEN SPLICE IT YEAH THIS I GUESS MIGHT BE FOR THAT 
IT'S A BIT LIKE MY GRANDDAD'S BROOM FIFTEEN NEW HEADS AND FOURTEEN NEW HANDLES 
THAT IS DEFINITELY ORIGINAL THOSE WERE REPLACED 
I THINK THE HANDLE'S ORIGINAL BUT IT'S TWENTY FIVE QUID WHAT DO YOU RECKON WHO'D BUY THAT 
SOMEONE THAT COLLECTS BOATS MARITIME STUFF WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'D MAYBE GET IT F. O. R. TWENTY 
I THINK IT'LL MAKE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE 
SO YOU'VE GOT TO NEGOTIATE A BIT BUT I DO JUST LIKE IT 
IT'S NICE TO BUY THINGS YOU LIKE VERY QUIRKY YEAH I LIKE IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK GREG I LIKE IT YOU WANT TO BUY IT WHY NOT 
GO ON OFF YOU GO 
NICE R. A. F. NUMBER ONE HAT R. A. F. NUMBER ONE HAT 
WHAT SORT OF COMMAND WOULD I GIVE WITH THIS ON CHOCKS AWAY CHAPS 
YOUNG MAN 
ONCE AGAIN IT'S POSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT YOU DON'T NEED A HUGE BUDGET TO BARGAIN HUNT AT THESE FAIRS 
LOOK WHAT I FOUND A PERFECTLY ORDINARY LITTLE BROWN BOX 
IT'S NICELY MADE MADE OF MAHOGANY AND IT'S BEEN BEAUTIFULLY POLISHED 
THE SECRET TO THIS THING IS IF I SLIDE OPEN THE TOP 
INSIDE I REVEAL A LITTLE GLAZED COMPARTMENT THAT HAS UNDERNEATH IT A DRIED LITTLE BRANCH 
WE NEVER REALLY KNOW WHAT ALL THIS IS ABOUT UNLESS YOU TURN IT OVER AND READ THE PASTED LABEL 
AND IT SAYS A SPRIG FROM MOUNT OLIVET 
MAY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY ONE 
H. M. S. CYCLOPS LIEUTENANT T. SHORT 
GARDEN OF OLIVET DEAR HALLOWED SPOT 
THE FAME OF THY WONDERS SHALL NE'ER BE FORGOT 
SO WHAT'S ALL THAT ABOUT I GUESS THAT LT T. SHORT WHEN HE VISITED THE HOLY LAND 
WENT UP THE MOUNT OF OLIVES AND SO MOVED WAS HE BY THAT EXPERIENCE 
THAT HE PICKED UP A LITTLE DRIED SPRIG OF OLIVE TREE 
AND TOOK IT BACK TO HIS SHIP AND THE CARPENTER MADE THIS LITTLE MAHOGANY BOX TO KEEP IT IN 
IT'S A CHARMING MEMENTO A RECORD OF THAT EARLY VICTORIAN BIT OF TOURISM 
AND FOR MY MIND PRETTY SPECIAL 
THERE'S ONE PLACE A JEWISH PERSON WOULD LIKE TO BE BURIED AND THAT IS THE MOUNT OF OLIVES 
SO IN RELIGIOUS TERMS IT'S A SPECIAL SPOT 
AND THIS BOX RECORDS A SPECIAL MOMENT FOR LT SHORT 
THEREFORE EXPENSIVE ACTUALLY NOT 
BECAUSE THIS IS AVAILABLE ON A STAND DOWN THE WAY FOR FIFTEEN 
A PALTRY AMOUNT OF MONEY 
FOR AN OBJECT THAT GIVES YOU THAT MUCH HISTORY AND INTEREST 
IN FACT CONSIDERABLY CHEAPER THAN A TRIP TO THE HOLY LAND 
WE BOUGHT OUR TEA CADDY AND WE KNOW WHAT WOOD IT WAS MAHOGANY AND THIS IS MAHOGANY 
IT'S THE SAME SORT OF TIMBER THIS IS BEAUTIFULLY BRASS BOUND 
THESE BRASS CORNERS ARE TO PROTECT THE BOX THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO TRANSPORT SOMEONE AROUND IN 
IS THAT THE ORIGINAL BRASS THEN ALL THAT'S ORIGINAL 
THE TEA CADDY WAS IN ORIGINAL CONDITION WITH BITS MISSING BUT THERE WERE NO SPLITS IN IT 
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM HERE SEE THAT SPLIT 
YOU CAN REPLACE A MOULDING AND LOOK LIKE IT'S ORIGINAL 
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO WITH THAT A SPLIT'S A SPLIT 
WILL IT LOSE A LOT OF MONEY IT WON'T DEVALUE IT BY MUCH HOW MUCH IS IT HE WANTS SEVENTY FIVE FOR IT 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN EXPENSIVE BOX 
WE'VE GOT A LABEL THERE THAT SAYS 
NINETEENTH CENTURY MAHOGANY BRASS BOUND CHRONOMETER BOX 
THAT'S A NAVY THING ISN'T IT YEAH THEY USED TO USE IT FOR MAPPING OUT ON THE SEAS 
IF YOU TURN IT UP HERE CAN YOU SEE TWO BRUISE MARKS THERE AND THERE 
THE ADJUSTERS ON THE TOP OF THE CHRONOMETER HAVE PRESSED INTO HERE 
SO YOU'VE GOT AN EMPTY BOX WHAT'LL YOU DO WITH AN EMPTY BOX 
HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT'S IDEAL FOR AND WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS 
IF YOU PUT A LITTLE FELT LINE STRIP OF WOOD ACROSS THERE AND ANOTHER ONE ACROSS THERE 
YOU'VE THEN GOT FOUR DIVISIONS YOU'VE GOT TO BUY THE PARTS 
YOU CAN THEN PUT FOUR DECANTERS IN HERE TO SIT IN HERE 
AND IT'S THEN A LOVELY DECANTER BOX 
RIGHT AND WHAT'S THE VALUE OF IT THEN 
PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED 
WHO KNOWS I LIKE IT I THINK AT AUCTION THAT IS GOING TO MAKE I'LL STICK MY NECK OUT 
I THINK IT'LL MAKE SIXTY TO NINETY 
DO YOU LIKE IT I DO BUT IT'S SEVENTY FIVE MAYBE WE COULD BARTER THEM DOWN 
USE OUR NAVAL CHARM GARY DEFINITELY 
LET'S GO AND DO IT GARY CHEERS PHIL THANKS

I'VE HAD A GOOD LOOK AT IT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WEAR HERE 
THE EBONISED WOODEN BASE EVERYTHING'S REALLY NICE ABOUT IT IT'S VERY STYLISH 
BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO WEAR AND THE BRASS ALL VERY NEW 
AND IT'S GOT THE MAKER'S NAME NICE TOUCH HERE 
AT THE SOUTH POLE GREAVES AND THOMAS OF LONDON I'D SAY IT'S MORE LIKE MUMBAI IN INDIA 
BUT I MAY BE WRONG WHAT'S THE PRICE TAG ON THIS ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE OH DEAR TOO MUCH WE'VE GOT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY LEFT 
WE COULD DO IT BUT WE COULD BE IN FOR A LOSS HERE 
WE'VE GOT TO SQUEEZE THE MAN I THINK A SMALL PINCER MOVEMENT 
LET'S TAKE HIM ON LEAVE IT WITH US TWO BIG LADS TO SORT IT OUT 
I'LL GET THE TEAS ON 
O. K. THAT'S IT TIME'S UP CHAPS BACK TO BASE 
THE REDS IGNITED THEIR HUNT WITH TWO PIECES OF WEDGWOOD

BECAUSE WE'RE IN SHEPTON MALLET THE SAILMAKER'S MALLET

THEY'RE KEEN AREN'T THEY NAVAL CHARM THAT'S WHAT IT IS 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY YOU'VE NEVER HAD THAT MUCH THERE'S A HOT PORK ROLL STAND FOR TWO POINT TWO OH A GO I'LL HAVE A HUNDRED 
NOW OVER THE MENDIPS FOR A BIT OF SOMERSET'S HISTORY 
CLEVEDON COURT SOMERSET 
ONE OF A FEW REMAINING FOURTEENTH CENTURY MANORIAL HALLS IN ENGLAND 
IT STILL POSSESSES MANY TREASURES INCLUDING A FINE COLLECTION ASSEMBLED BY A FORMER OWNER 
SIR EDMUND ELTON 
IT WAS AFTER WATCHING WORKERS MAKING TILES IN A LOCAL CLEVEDON BRICKYARD 
THAT SIR EDMUND ELTON FELT INSPIRED TO MAKE CERAMIC TILES FOR CHURCHES 
AND THIS SHED VERY RAPIDLY BECAME ONE OF ENGLAND'S BUSIEST POTTERIES 
ALTHOUGH NOTHING REMAINS OF THE ORIGINAL POTTERY EQUIPMENT INSIDE 
IT WAS HERE THAT SIR EDMUND'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH CERAMICS WAS CONCEIVED 
WHICH ULTIMATELY LED TO THE BIRTH OF COURSE OF ELTONWARE 
THE COLLECTION HERE AT CLEVEDON REPRESENTS A GLIMPSE INTO FORTY YEARS OF WORK BY ELTON 
WHAT IS THE COMMON LINK BETWEEN THIS THE ULTIMATE CRUDELY THROWN AND DECORATED POT 
THAT QUITE FRANKLY ANY EIGHT YEAR OLD MIGHT HAVE DONE 
AND THIS THE ULTIMATE IN SOPHISTICATION IN TERMS OF STYLE AND GLAZE 
THE ANSWER IS EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF HARD WORK AND DETERMINATION 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY ELTON CONSTRUCTED A KILN AND PREPARED SOME TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT PIECES FOR EXPERIMENTATION 
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WERE BLOWN UP IN THE KILN BECAUSE THE PROCESS OF FIRING AND GLAZING POTS 
WAS COMPLETELY NEW TO HIM GEORGE MASTERS A VILLAGER 
WAS ENCOURAGED TO JOIN SIR EDMUND IN THE SHED AND THEY WOULD SIT THERE THROWING POTS ON A WHEEL 
CREATING SHAPES LIKE THIS 
THIS OVOID POT IS TYPICAL OF THE SORT OF MEDIEVALISM 
THAT SIR EDMUND WAS INTERESTED IN 
HE'S CREATED A SIMPLE SHAPE BUT HAS THEN DECORATED IT IN QUITE A COMPLICATED WAY 
THESE RAISED AREAS ARE CALLED SLIP 
HE THEN CARVED THE SLIP INTO CERTAIN SHAPES 
COMBINED WITH THESE LOVELY GLAZES 
THE WHOLE THING IS THEN COVERED IN A HARD LEAD GLAZE WHICH GIVES IT THIS SHINY FINISH 
SO POPULAR WERE THESE POTS THAT TIFFANY'S TOOK HIM UP AS AGENTS IN AMERICA 
AND HE WON MANY GOLD AND SILVER MEDALS AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY 
NOT ONLY CLASSIC MEDIEVAL POTS WERE HIS FORTE 
BUT WACKY THINGS LIKE THIS SANG DE BOEUF VASE 
HE'S COPIED THE COLOUR SCHEME FROM CHINESE CERAMICS 
BUT HAS PUT IT ON EARTHENWARE 
AND THIS THING WITH THESE GROWTHS SPROUTING FROM THE TOP 
THAT RATHER RESEMBLE A COW'S UDDER HENCE THE FAMILY CALLING IT THE UDDER VASE 
IS ONE OF HIS MOST PECULIAR CREATIONS 
I TALKED BEFORE ABOUT THE VERY SOPHISTICATED NATURE OF THIS VASE 
THE GLAZE IS TRULY AMAZING 
JUST LOOK AT IT ON THAT GOLD POT OR EVEN THIS SILVERY CHALICE 
THIS IS CREATED BY A COMPLICATED FIRING AND RE FIRING PROCESS 
WITH METALS IN THE GLAZE THAT REACT AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN THE HEAT 
AND CREATE THIS LOVELY SPANGLY EFFECT SADLY ELTON DIED AS A RESULT OF THIS LOVE AFFAIR 
HE DIED OF LEAD POISONING NO DOUBT AS A RESULT OF LASHING ON ALL THOSE LEAD GLAZES 
ON ALL THESE GLORIOUS POTS IT'S A GREAT STORY ISN'T IT 
I DON'T SUPPOSE OUR CONTESTANTS HAVE A SIMILAR STORY TO TELL DOWN AT THE AUCTION 
WE'RE STAYING IN SOMERSET BUT HEADING DOWN SOUTH TO CREWKERNE FOR TODAY'S AUCTION 
IT'S GREAT TO BE AT LAWRENCE'S WITH AUCTIONEER RICHARD KAY MORNING 
IT'S LOVELY TO BE HERE FIRST UP CHARLIE AND ROBERTA WITH JAMES 
WENT FOR THIS GREEN JASPER PART SET WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
IT MAKES A NICE SET SLIGHTLY MORE ATTRACTIVE IN GREEN 
BUT NOT STAMPED ON THE BASE TO SAY IT WAS MADE IN ENGLAND 
SO LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN DATE AS OPPOSED TO EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
JUST TWO PIECES WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE WORTH 
I SUPPOSE WE'D EXPECT TWENTY TO THIRTY ACKNOWLEDGING THE DAMAGE AND CHIPS 
WELL THEY PAID FORTY MIGHT BE A BIT OF A STRUGGLE 
WHAT ABOUT THIS STAFFORDSHIRE BOWL I GUESS IT WAS PART OF A SET 
WE WOULD EXPECT SO AND PROBABLY MISSING ITS JUG BUT IN GOOD CONDITION AND A USEFUL SHAPE 
GOOD INTEREST AND DEMAND HERE FOR RUSTIC APPEAL 
I WOULD HAVE SAID THIRTY TO FORTY FOR THAT NOT TOO BAD THIRTY TWO THEY PAID 
IN WITH A CHANCE THEY MAY MAKE A PROFIT WITH THAT WHICH IS GREAT 
NOW THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE 
AN ATTRACTIVE ITEM BUT HOW OLD IS IT FROM A DISTANCE IT LOOKS OLDER THAN IT IS 
TYPICAL OF A LOT OF REPRODUCTION ITEMS DESIGNED TO LOOK OF AN ANTIQUE OR HISTORICAL NATURE 
THAT ARE PRODUCED IN THE FAR EAST WE HAVE TO BE VERY WARY OF THEM MANY PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE OLDER 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WORTH MUCH NOT MUCH MORE THAN TWENTY OR THIRTY 
MY LORD THEY PAID ONE HUNDRED FORTY THEY'LL NEED THEIR BONUS BUY 
RIGHT THEN CHARLIE ROBERTA YOU GAVE JAMES BRAXTON EIGHTY EIGHT SMACKERS 
WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE SPENT IT ON YEAH SHOW THEM JAMES 
YOU GUYS IN THE SERVICES LOVE A CUP OF TEA 
NOW THAT IS A KETTLE SINCE WE BOUGHT IT THE SCRAP PRICE OF THIS HAS GONE UP BY TEN QUID 
WHEN WAS IT MADE JAMES ARTS AND CRAFTS TURN OF THE CENTURY NINETEEN TEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
PROBABLY LOOKING AFTER A FAMILY OF TWELVE WANT TO FEEL THE WEIGHT 
A FEW CUPS OF TEA OUT OF THAT A LOAD OF COPPER IN THERE 
SO MR. BRAXTON RATES ITS SCRAP VALUE WHICH IS A PROMISING START 
SELL IT OR SCRAP IT TIM THAT'S THE NAME FOR OUR NEW SERIES IS IT 
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THAT THIRTY FIVE 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S REASONABLE SOUNDS REASONABLE BIG PROFIT 
GUARANTEED OF COURSE HOW MUCH 
I THINK WE SHOULD TRICKLE IN WITH TEN OR FIFTEEN 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE NOW DECIDE AFTER YOU SELL THESE 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS 
SO RICHARD WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS A GOOD BIG LUMP OF COPPER 
BUT HOW MUCH USE IT HAS IS DEBATABLE 
VERY FEW PEOPLE BUY THESE THINGS TO USE THEM IT'S NOT BADLY MADE BUT IS NOT BY A KNOWN DESIGNER 
IT'S REALLY QUITE A LARGE AND AWKWARD LUMP TO HAVE EXCEPT FOR A DRESSER 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS LIKELY TO BRING I SHOULD THINK TEN TO TWENTY 
MR. BRAXTON WILL BE DISAPPOINTED 
NOW FOR GARY AND GREG THEIR FIRST ITEM IS THE LOVELY DECANTER BOX 
THAT'S A HANDSOME THING IT IS AND IT'S IN GOOD CONDITION THE COLOUR'S VERY GOOD 
HINGES ARE ALL SECURE VERY ATTRACTIVE 
AND THIS WOULD HAVE PROTECTED THE CORNERS IF YOU WERE TRAVELLING 
I SUPPOSE SO A VERY ROBUST CONTAINER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO 
WOULD IT SELL BETTER AS A CHRONOMETER BOX OR DECANTER BOX 
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE MORE APPEAL AS A DECANTER BOX DO YOU 
THAT'S YOUR PUNT ANYWAY SO WHAT'S THE ESTIMATE IT'S VERY HANDSOME WE'VE SAID THIRTY TO FIFTY 
BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED BY MORE THEY PAID FIFTY FIVE THEY'RE IN WITH A GOOD CHANCE 
PHILIP SERRELL WILL BE PLEASED 
NEXT FOR THAT LOT IS THE MAHOGANY CADDY WHICH I GUESS IS QUITE OLD 
GEORGE THE THIRD LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
IT'S SURPRISING THAT ONE CAN BUY AN ITEM THAT IS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS OLD 
IN A MARKET FOR FIVE 
IT'S A BARGAIN THAT'S WHAT THIS PROGRAMME IS ALL ABOUT BARGAIN HUNT WHAT WILL IT BRING THEN 
IT IS A BIT TIRED YES AND IT'S BEEN INEXPERTLY REPAIRED WITH SELLOTAPE 
I SHOULD THINK IT'S WORTH TWENTY TO THIRTY AN EXCELLENT BUY FOR FIVE 
I GUESS SOME OF YOUR BUYERS LIKE TO BUY THINGS IN ORIGINAL CONDITION AND GO AWAY AND RESTORE THEM 
NEXT THE MALLET THAT'S A PRETTY ODDBALL THING 
BUT UNDERSTANDABLE WITH THE ROYAL NAVY CONNECTIONS OF OUR TEAM YES 
APPARENTLY IT'S A SAILMAKER'S MALLET APPARENTLY I'VE NEVER COME ACROSS ONE BEFORE OR A SAILMAKER 
AND THEY NEVER HAVE A MALLET 
QUITE IT'S A FAIRLY CHUNKY LUMP IT IS IT'S A HEAVY PIECE OF TOOL AS WELL 
BUILT TO LAST IT HAS LASTED HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH 
I THINK IT'S WORTH FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE THEY PAID TWENTY THAT'S NOT TOO BAD IT'S IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'D EXPECT 
I THINK WE'VE GOT THE POTENTIAL OF THREE LITTLE TICKLY PROFITS 
ANYWAY LET'S FIND OUT ABOUT THE BLUES' BONUS BUY 
WELL YOU GAVE THE MAESTRO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY YES YOU TRUSTED HIM WITH THAT 
IN THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD FIND YOU SOMETHING SPECTACULAR TO MAKE A PROFIT ABSOLUTELY SHOW US 
RATHER APPROPRIATELY FOR THESE TWO 
A DOG COLLAR IT'S A NICE THING NO HERE WE GO 
HANDLE IT WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT IT'S LOVELY 
OLD LEATHER BRASS STUDS THEY'RE QUITE COLLECTABLE BITS MISSING YOU'RE JUST BEING PICKY NOW 
HE'S GOT BITS MISSING THAT'S A QUALITY ITEM HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK EIGHTY 
YOU BOYS ARE IN AT EIGHTY GET IN THERE 
FIFTEEN FIFTEEN 
OUR FRIENDSHIP NOW HAS BEEN RESUMED 
FUNNY THIS SO YOU GUYS RECKONED EIGHTY QUID AND YOU PAID FIFTEEN 
WHAT DOES THE AUCTIONEER THINK 
I THINK THIS IS A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD MUNDANE DOG COLLAR 
THE ONES THAT DO WELL ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MADE OF SILVER ONES WITH NAMES ON THEM 
THAT HAVE A BIT OF EMBELLISHMENT AND DESIGN 
THIS IS A COLLAR I THINK FOR A HOUND THAT SLEEPS IN A YARD RATHER THAN A BEST OF BREED 
YOU DON'T LIKE IT THAT MUCH I WOULDN'T BUY IT NOT MY SIZE 
BUT THERE IS A STRANGE COLLECTORS' MARKET FOR THESE SORTS OF THINGS 
AND IT IS ORIGINAL PRETTY GOOD CONDITION ALBEIT A BIT WORN 
CHEWED A BIT CHEWED POSSIBLY TWENTY OR THIRTY ON A GOOD DAY THAT'S NOT TOO BAD PHILIP PAID FIFTEEN 
MIGHT BE IN WITH A CHANCE MIGHT BE IN WITH A WOOF 
HAVE YOU EVER DREAMT OF BUYING A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR OLD HOUSE IN DILAPIDATED CONDITION 
AND DOING IT UP WELL IF YOU HAVE BUT YOU'VE NOT ACTUALLY DONE IT 
MAYBE YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT CONSIDER BUYING A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR OLD PIECE OF FURNITURE AND DOING THE SAME JOB 
BECAUSE HERE IS A GEORGIAN ARMCHAIR THAT IS RIPE FOR MODERNISATION AND IMPROVEMENT 
BASICALLY THIS CHAIR EXPRESSES ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CHAIR MAKING 
YOU'VE GOT AN OPEN STRETCHER A BEECH RAIL AND ALL THESE HUNDREDS OF HOLES ALL AROUND THIS FRAME 
AREN'T WOODWORM HOLES THEY'RE HOLES MADE BY THE UPHOLSTERER'S NAILS 
THIS CHAIR HASN'T BEEN REUPHOLSTERED ONCE IN ITS LIFETIME BUT I WOULD THINK SIX OR EIGHT TIMES 
EVERY TIME IT GETS REUPHOLSTERED FRESH NAILS ARE PUT IN AND THAT'S WHY THE FRAME LOOKS SO PEPPERED 
ONCE UPON A TIME THE BACK OF THIS CHAIR WASN'T UPHOLSTERED AT ALL 
IN FACT IT LOOKED RATHER LIKE THIS 
YOU SEE THAT SHIELD SHAPED BACK WITH AN OPEN SPLAT 
UNDERNEATH WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE UPHOLSTERED YOU CAN SEE THE BOTTOM HERE OF A SHIELD 
THAT WOULD HAVE CURVED AROUND LIKE THAT AND LOOKED MUCH LIKE THAT ONE 
BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED REMEMBER THIS WAS MADE IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY OR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY 
PERHAPS IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY OR ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THE BACK BROKE 
SOMEBODY LEANT BACK AT A DINNER PARTY AND IT SNAPPED 
RATHER THAN THROW AWAY THE LOWER PART THEY WENT TO THE LOCAL VILLAGE CRAFTSPERSON 
WHO CONSTRUCTED OUT OF CHEAP TIMBER BECAUSE IT WOULD ALWAYS BE COVERED BY UPHOLSTERY MATERIAL 
A TALL BACK A MORE FASHIONABLE AND COMFORTABLE TALL BACKED 
SOFT PADDED AND UPHOLSTERED CHAIR 
BRILLIANT ISN'T IT
