CONTROVERSIAL RELIGIOUS ORGANISATION 
I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'S KABBALAH 
I THINK I WOULD HAVE READ IT AND SCI 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S OPUS DEI OR SCIENTOLOGY 
I THINK I WOULD HAVE READ IT SOMEWHERE IN NEWSPAPERS 
BUT I THINK OPUS DEI IS A LITTLE BIT TOO CONTROVERSIAL I THINK 
SO I'LL GO WITH SCIENTOLOGY AS MY FINAL ANSWER 
ALTHOUGH I DO IT WITH RESERVATION 
O. K. AND YOU HAD A LONG THINK ABOUT IT DIDN'T YOU 
SCIENTOLOGY OR OPUS DEI WAS THE TOSS UP 
AND THE ANSWER IS OPUS DEI 
THAT'S WHY YOU HADN'T READ ABOUT SCIENTOLOGY THERE'S NOT ANY LINKS 
O. K. CHANCE FOR THE LEAD C. J. 
IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE DETERMINATION AND DIRECTION OF GOVERNMENT POLICY 
SURELY THAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S JOB WHICH WOULD BE EXECUTIVE 
THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU FIRST READ THE QUESTION

JUST INSTINCT FROM LOOKING AT THEM I'M GOING TO GO FOR GRENADA 
O. K. GRENADA

CHRIS WHO WON HER THIRD GRAND SLAM SINGLES TITLE AT THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
AUSTRALIAN OPEN TENNIS TOURNAMENT 
I THINK SERENA WILLIAMS HAS WON MORE THAN THAT 
SO IT'S A TOSS UP BETWEEN JELENA JANKOVIC AND MARIA SHARAPOVA 
AND THE NAME THAT JUMPS OUT AT ME IS MARIA SHARAPOVA 
NOT THAT I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT TENNIS 
WELL YOU KNOW ENOUGH TO GET THAT RIGHT 
MARIA SHARAPOVA WON THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

IT'S JASON WHITE 
JASON WHITE CAPTAINED SCOTLAND 
WHICH AUSTRALIAN CITY ORIGINALLY GAVE ITS NAME 
TO THE RULES FOR AUSTRALIAN RULES FOOTBALL 
AS THE GAME WAS INVENTED THERE IN THE LATE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTIES 
I DON'T THINK DARWIN WAS EVEN THERE IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTIES 
COS IT'S WAY UP IN THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES 
I THINK PERTH IS A BIT GENTEEL FOR A ROUGHHOUSE GAME LIKE 
AUSSIE RULES FOOTBALL SO I'LL SAY MELBOURNE 
IT IS MELBOURNE RIGHT ANSWER 
WELL WORKED OUT CHRIS 
YOU WILL BE PLAYING IN THE FINAL ROUND 
AND A SLIP UP THERE ALEX
