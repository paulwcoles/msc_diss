AND THE ANGEL CAST SATAN INTO THE BOTTOMLESS PIT AND SHUT HIM UP 
AND SET A SEAL UPON HIM THAT HE SHOULD DECEIVE THE NATIONS NO MORE 
TILL ONE THOUSAND YEARS HAD BEEN FULFILLED 
AND WHEN THE ONE THOUSAND YEARS ARE EXPIRED SATAN SHOULD BE LOOSED OUT OF HIS PRISON 
IT IS THE YEAR NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THE WORLD IS DUE TO END IN FIVE YEARS' TIME 
AND THESE MONKS ARE CARRYING THE RELICS OF A SAINT ALONG THIS ROAD 
THEY'RE FLEEING FROM THE ANTICHRIST AND THEY'VE BEEN ON THE MOVE FOR YEARS 
AND NOW THEY'VE ENDED UP HERE 
DURHAM CATHEDRAL REMAINS ONE OF OUR BEST LOVED BUILDINGS 
BUT WE LOST THE KEY TO ITS MEANING FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
WHEN AN ACT OF GROSS CULTURAL VANDALISM TORE OUT ITS HEART 
IT'S A BUILDING AS ENIGMATIC AS THE PYRAMIDS THE STONES ARE CODED 
AND THE CODE CAN BE BROKEN THE CATHEDRAL WILL GIVE UP ITS SECRETS 
WHEN PILGRIMS HAVING TOILED ALONG THEIR PILGRIMS' ROUTE 
SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY MUST HAVE BEEN UTTERLY OVERWHELMED 
THESE WERE PEOPLE WHOSE WORLD WAS SMALL IN EVERY SENSE 
AND THEN THEY WERE CONFRONTED BY THIS 
THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT GOD HAD CREATED ON THIS ROCKY OUTCROP THE NEW JERUSALEM THE CELESTIAL CITY 
CUTHBERT WAS TO BECOME THE MOST VENERATED SAINT OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
THIS CATHEDRAL IS A MASSIVE SHRINE TO SAINT CUTHBERT 
PILGRIMS IN THEIR THOUSANDS IN THEIR TENS OF THOUSANDS FLOCKED TO THIS PLACE 
CUTHBERT WAS A SEVENTH CENTURY MONK ON THE HOLY ISLAND OF LINDISFARNE OFF THE COAST OF NORTHUMBRIA 
HE HAD CONFRONTED THE DEVIL AND WON CLEARING THE ISLAND OF DEMONS 
BUT HIS SAINTLINESS WAS CHALLENGED BY A PRINCESS WHO ATTEMPTED TO SEDUCE HIM 
AND THEN CALLED ON HER FATHER TO PUNISH HIM 
THE PRINCESS ACCUSED CUTHBERT OF MAKING HER PREGNANT 
GOD CAME TO THE AID OF CUTHBERT 
AND HE TURNED HIS BACK ON WOMANKIND FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE AND BEYOND 
CUTHBERT HAD BEEN CONSUMED WITH THE APPROACHING APOCALYPSE 
THE MERCILESS RAPE AND PILLAGE BY THE VIKINGS HAD CONFIRMED HIS FOLLOWERS' FEAR OF THE ANTICHRIST 
TO PROTECT THEIR SAINT THE MONKS MOVED HIS REMAINS FURTHER AND FURTHER INLAND 
FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS CUTHBERT'S FOLLOWERS CARRIED HIS BODY FROM PLACE TO PLACE TO KEEP IT FROM DANGER 
WHEN CUTHBERT'S COFFIN WAS OPENED 
HIS BODY WAS FOUND TO BE UNCORRUPTED UNROTTED 
AS INTACT AS THE DAY ON WHICH IT HAD BEEN INTERRED 
THIS WAS SEEN AS EVIDENCE OF CUTHBERT BEING A SAINT 
A SAINT WITH THE POWER TO HEAL 
CUTHBERT'S BODY WAS MOVED MANY TIMES 
TILL A MONK HAD A VISION OF THE SAINT'S FINAL RESTING PLACE 
ABOVE A BEND OF THE RIVER WEIR IN DURHAM 
ENSHRINED BY THE MONKS IN THE YEAR NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
A SIMPLE WOODEN STRUCTURE KNOWN AS THE WHITE CHURCH STOOD FOR NEARLY A CENTURY 
BEFORE WORK BEGAN ON AN ENORMOUS STONE CATHEDRAL DEDICATED TO CUTHBERT 
AND ASTONISHINGLY DESPITE THE FRENZIED DESTRUCTION OF CATHOLIC RELICS DURING THE SIXTEEN C. REFORMATION 
HIS SARCOPHAGUS STILL SURVIVES 
THIS IS A REMARKABLE SURVIVAL IT'S SAINT CUTHBERT'S COFFIN 
IT DATES FROM THE SEVENTH CENTURY AND THE CARVINGS ON IT ARE MOST REVEALING ON THE LID 
UP HERE WE HAVE A LARGE IMAGE OF CHRIST 
THAT'S SURROUNDED BY THE FOUR BEASTS OF THE APOCALYPSE FROM THE BOOK OF REVELATION 
AND THERE BEFORE ME WAS A PALE HORSE HIS NAME WAS DEATH 
THE SUN TURNED BLACK 
THE BOOK OF REVELATION IS THE LAST BOOK OF THE BIBLE 
AND PROPHESIES GOD'S EPIC BATTLE WITH SATAN IN AN APOCALYPTIC VISION OF THE END OF THE WORLD 
CAME FIRE SMOKE AND SULPHUR 
THE WHOLE MOON TURNED BLOOD RED AND THE STARS IN THE SKY FELL TO EARTH 
HIS NUMBER IS SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX 
BUT THE BOOK OF REVELATION ALSO HOLDS WITHIN IT THE KEY TO SURVIVING THE APOCALYPSE 
AND THERE WAS A RAINBOW AND ROUND ABOUT 
WERE FOUR AND TWENTY SEATS 
AND UPON THE SEATS WERE FOUR AND TWENTY ELDERS SITTING 
THIS IS A VERY FASCINATING TEXT FROM THE BIBLE FROM THE BOOK OF REVELATION IT'S VERY REVEALING 
WE KNOW THAT FROM THE START THE SHRINE OF SAINT CUTHBERT HERE 
HAD HANGING ABOVE IT AN IMAGE OF CHRIST IN JUDGMENT ON A RAINBOW 
AND FROM THE START THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR BENEDICTINE MONKS 
SO IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE BENEDICTINES WERE REPLICATING THE BOOK OF REVELATION 
TAKING THE BIBLE AS A DESIGN TEXT FOR THE CREATION OF THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY 
AND FOR THE CATHEDRAL ITSELF 
UNDERSTANDING THE BENEDICTINE ORDER 
IS IN A SENSE THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING DURHAM CATHEDRAL 
THE BENEDICTINES HAD BEEN FOUNDED IN THE SIX C. 
AND THEY WERE MEN OF AMAZING KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING MUCH OF IT FROM THE EAST 
THE BENEDICTINES WITH SAINT AUGUSTINE BROUGHT CHRISTIANITY TO ENGLAND SO THEY'RE PART OF OUR HISTORY 
BUT THEY WEREN'T JUST MONKS LOST IN PRAYER AND CONTEMPLATION 
THEY WERE ALSO MEN OF INTELLECT ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF IDEAS FROM ALL OVER THE KNOWN WORLD 
THEY KNEW ABOUT MEDICINE SCIENCE MUSIC AND OF COURSE ABOUT ARCHITECTURE 
ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ABLE TO VISUALISE TO IMAGINE SUCH A GREAT BUILDING AS DURHAM 
THEY WEREN'T PRACTICAL MEN THEY COULDN'T HAVE BUILT IT THEY HAD TO WORK WITH MASONS 
LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE MASONS THEY'RE ALSO PART OF A GREAT BROTHERHOOD 
AND OF COURSE THIS MARRIAGE OF THE INTELLECTUAL MONKS WITH THEIR GREAT LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE 
WITH THE PRACTICAL MASONS 
MADE POSSIBLE THE CREATION OF THIS GREAT MASTERPIECE 
BUILDING DURHAM CATHEDRAL IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY 
IT WAS DONE WITH IMMENSE COURAGE THEY BUILT BY TRIAL AND ERROR 
IT WAS A GREAT PIONEERING STRUCTURE ON THE EDGE OF WHAT THEY KNEW COULD BE POSSIBLE 
IT WASN'T DESIGNED ON A COMPUTER OR DRAWING BOARD SOMEBODY HAD A VISION SAW IT IN THEIR MIND'S EYE 
AND THAT WAS REALISED IT WAS A MAN WHO COULD SEE THE INVISIBLE 
HE COULD SEE DURHAM CATHEDRAL BEFORE IT WAS BUILT THAT'S THE MIRACLE 
ON THE ELEVENTH AUGUST ONE THOUSAND NINETY THREE 
BISHOP WILLIAM DE SAINT CALAIS LAID THE FOUNDATION STONE 
IT WAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING AND SIGNIFICANT BUILDINGS EVER CREATED IN BRITAIN 
IT TRACES A SPECTACULAR DEVELOPMENT IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE POTENTIAL OF BUILDING MATERIALS 
BY NEW TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES OF CONSTRUCTION 
IT IS A MONUMENT TO INNOVATION EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING TO SHEER INVENTION 
WHEN COMPLETED FORTY YEARS LATER THE CATHEDRAL WAS TO BE IN A SENSE 
THE FIRST MODERN BUILDING IN BRITAIN 
THE WORK OF THE DURHAM MASONS IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY INCORPORATED INCREDIBLE ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING 
THE BENEDICTINES WANTED A MAGNIFICENT STONE CATHEDRAL TO HOUSE CUTHBERT'S REMAINS 
BUT TO DO THIS THEY NEEDED TO FIND OUT HOW TO SUPPORT A STONE ROOF OF SUCH GREAT HEIGHT AND WIDTH 
THE ANSWER LAY IN A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF ARCHITECTURAL FORM 
TAKE THE HUMBLE EGG FOR EXAMPLE 
HERE WE ARE 
NOW A MASON WHO OBSERVED THIS WORK OF NATURE THIS WONDROUS WORK OF GOD 
WOULD'VE REALISED FRAGILE MATERIAL CAN BE GIVEN ADDED STRENGTH THROUGH DESIGN A DOME DESIGN 
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN IF YOU TRY TO BREAK AN EGG 
ALONG ITS SHORT AXIS IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO DIFFICULT 
NOW I'VE SAID THAT 
KILLER EGG 
IT'S VERY GOOD FOR THE HAIR APPARENTLY 
NOW MANY A MASON WOULD HAVE UNDERGONE THE SAME EXPERIENCE 
NOW TAKE THE EGG 
AND BREAK IT OR ATTEMPT TO BREAK IT ALONG ITS LONG AXIS HERE THE DOME PART 
IT IS 
UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE 
SO A MEDIEVAL MASON WITH THE EYES TO SEE AND THE WIT TO UNDERSTAND 
WOULD HAVE REALISED THAT THIS ARCHED SHAPE THIS DOME SHAPE IS ARCHED 
IS INHERENTLY STRONG A VERY STRONG FORM 
THEREFORE APPLY THE ARCH TO ARCHITECTURE AND ONE GETS A BUILDING THAT IS IMMENSELY STRONG 
THE BRILLIANCE OF THE MASONS AT DURHAM 
WAS THEIR UNDERSTANDING THAT STONE LIKE EGGSHELL CAN BE MADE STRONGER JUST BY SHAPING IT CORRECTLY 
THE NORTH TRANSEPT RECEIVED A STONE VAULT BY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FOUR 
THIS WAS A BREATHTAKING ACHIEVEMENT 
AN ACHIEVEMENT REALISED BY THE APPLICATION OF PIONEERING BUILDING TECHNOLOGY 
AND THAT TECHNOLOGY IS EXPRESSED BY THE STONE RIB 
THESE RUN FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND FROM CORNER TO CORNER 
THEY GIVE THE VAULT STRENGTH FLEXIBILITY MAKE IT MUCH MORE SOLID 
THEY WEREN'T A NEW IDEA IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FOUR 
BUT NEVER BEFORE HAD RIBS BEEN USED IN A STONE VAULT AT SUCH A HEIGHT 
WHAT'S FASCINATING IS THAT THEY REPRESENT A TRANSFORMATION IN THE WAY BUILDINGS WERE CONCEIVED 
AND THIS PROVIDES A SKELETON FOR THE GREAT BODY OF THE CATHEDRAL 
BUT THERE ARE TECHNICAL AND ARTISTIC PROBLEMS 
IN FORMING HIGH LEVEL STONE VAULTS UTILISING RIBS THAT TAKE A SEMI CIRCULAR FORM 
ROUND ARCHES WERE THE TRADITIIONAL WAY OF SUPPORTING LOADS 
BUT THEY DIDN'T COPE WELL WITH THE IMMENSE MASS OF A CATHEDRAL ROOF 
THE ANSWER TO THESE TECHNICAL AND ARTISTIC PROBLEMS APPEARED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WESTERN EUROPE 
IN THE NAVE VAULT BEHIND ME 
THE SOLUTION WAS THE USE OF POINTED ARCHES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS 
AND IN DURHAM CATHEDRAL WE FIND A RADICAL ARCHITECTURAL INNOVATION 
EVEN POINTED ARCHES EXERT SOME HORIZONTAL OUTWARD THRUST 
ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT IS TO CREATE A VERY MASSIVE WALL TO CONTAIN THE THRUST OF THE ARCH 
BUT A MORE INGENIOUS SOLUTION IS TO CREATE A COUNTER THRUST 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING HERE 
THIS ARCH ABOVE ME IS A FLYING BUTTRESS 
WHAT IT'S DOING IS USING ITS FORCE TO WITHSTRAIN TO HOLD HERE 
THE THRUST COMING FROM THE ARCH IN THE NAVE 
IT'S ALSO TRANSFERRING SOME OF THAT THRUST TO THE OUTER WALLS OF THE CATHEDRAL THIS IS VERY INGENIOUS 
WE SEE IN DURHAM ALL THOSE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE GOTHIC 
THE GREAT POINTED ARCHES RIB VAULTS AND THE FLYING BUTTRESS 
AND ALL THIS IS TWENTY YEARS BEFORE GOTHIC IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED INVENTED IN N. FRANCE 
THIS NEW UNDERSTANDING OF STONE ENGINEERING GIVING STRENGTH TO STRUCTURAL DESIGN 
MEANT THAT CATHEDRAL WALLS COULD BE LESS SUBSTANTIAL THAN EVER BEFORE 
WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WINDOWS COULD BE BIGGER AND GOD'S LIGHT COULD FLOOD INSIDE 
INTRIGUING INSIGHT INTO DURHAM'S PROGRESSIVE DESIGN CAN BE FOUND IN A CHAPEL AT THE WEST END 
HOW CAN THE NAVE BE SUCH A PIONEERING PIECE OF ENGINEERED ARCHITECTURE 
WELL THIS STRUCTURE COULD HOLD A CLUE 
THIS IS THE LATER CHAPEL AT THE WEST END BUILT IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY 
NOW TO ME THIS STRANGE STRUCTURE IS LIKE AN ISLAMIC PRAYER HALL 
LIKE A MOSQUE WITH ITS FIVE AISLES OF EQUAL HEIGHT IT'S VERY STRANGE INDEED 
AND DOES SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS IDEAS FOR THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THIS CATHEDRAL 
DID COME FROM THE EAST FROM THE WORLD OF ISLAM 
WHERE IDEAS WERE MORE ADVANCED ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING 
BUT THERE'S MORE ISN'T THERE 
MAYBE IT WASN'T JUST IDEAS COMING FROM THE EAST BUT MASONS TOO 
CAN IT BE THAT THIS GREAT CATHEDRAL WAS TO A DEGREE CONSTRUCTED BY MUSLIMS 
IN THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES THE ARAB WORLD WAS IN MANY RESPECTS 
MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THE WEST 
ARAB ENGINEERS HAD EVEN DEVELOPED POINTED ARCHES CENTURIES PREVIOUSLY 
ONE EXPLANATION AS TO HOW DURHAM WAS SO AHEAD OF ITS TIME 
MUST SURELY BE THAT MUSLIM CRAFTSMEN WORKED ALONGSIDE THEIR CHRISTIAN COUNTERPARTS 
THERE ARE FURTHER CLUES IN THE DEANERY 
SO WHAT IS THIS DECORATION 
THE WINDOW'S OBVIOUSLY THIRTEEN C. SO PRESUMABLY IT'S THE SAME DATE THIS IS VERY REMARKABLE 
WE'RE UPSTAIRS IN THE MODERN DEANERY FORMERLY THE ROOFSPACE OF THE MEDIEVAL CHAPEL 
YOU'VE GOT A TYPICAL GOTHIC PIECE OF CHRISTIAN ARCHITECTURE HERE 
BUT THIS DECORATION IS WHAT'S CALLED SUFIC IT'S AN ISLAMIC TYPE OF ART 
WHY IT IS HERE WHAT IT'S DOING HERE I DON'T KNOW 
THIS IS QUITE AMAZING 
HERE'S ANOTHER SECTION OF THIS THIRTEEN C. SUFI INSPIRED WALL PAINTING HERE 
CLUES TO THE IDENTITIES OF THE MEN WHO MADE THIS BUILDING ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN 
BUT TANTALISING HINTS CAN BE FOUND IN THE GRAFFITI ETCHED IN THE STONE 
THE STONES IN THIS WALL ARE COVERED WITH MASONS' MARKS 
THEY'RE ONE OF THE MYSTERIES OF THIS MYSTERIOUS BUILDING 
WERE THEY SIMPLY MEANS BY WHICH MASONS MARKED THEIR WORK SO THEY COULD GET PAID PIECEWORK 
OR WERE THEY SOMETHING MORE SIGNIFICANT 
THE WAY THE DIFFERENT MASONS THE LODGES WANTED TO LEAVE THEIR MARK ON THIS BUILDING 
WE DON'T KNOW THEIR NAMES BUT WE KNOW THESE PEOPLE HAD BEEN HERE CONTRIBUTING TO THIS HOUSE OF GOD 
HERE WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE A BOW AND ARROW THAT REPEATS UP THERE 
I SEE A LOZENGE EVEN HERE 
LOTS OF TRIANGULAR FORMS CIRCLES 
THIS LOOKS LIKE A PENTANGLE HERE EXTRAORDINARY 
THIS IS THE MOST SACRED TOOL TO ANY MASON WHETHER CHRISTIAN OR MUSLIM 
THESE ARE ACTUALLY MEDIEVAL 
AND THEY'RE IN GOOD CONDITION 
WHEN I WAS IN ISFAHAN I TRIED TO GET THE CRAFTSMEN TO SHOW ME THEIR DIVIDERS OR COMPASSES 
AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN ADMIT THEY HAD ANY 
HE SAID I'LL FIND YOU SOME IN THE MARKET THEY SIMPLY WOULD NOT SHOW ANYBODY THEM 
THE WORD ARCHITECT WAS NOT MUCH USED AT THE TIME THEY WERE CALLED MASTERS OF THE COMPASS 
IF YOU WERE A MASTER OF THE COMPASS THEN THAT'S THE HIGHEST THING YOU COULD BE 
WHILE THE THINKING WAS PROGRESSIVE SO WAS THE CONSTRUCTION 
THE FORTY YEARS IT TOOK TO BUILD DURHAM CATHEDRAL SEEMS REMARKABLY QUICK SO HOW WAS IT DONE 
PREFABRICATION ALL VERY MODERN 
NOW THIS PATTERN LOOKS PRETTY COMPLICATED 
BUT IT'S FORMED THIS COLUMN WITH TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARVED STONE 
HERE'S ONE 
AND HERE'S THE OTHER AND THESE STONES ARE USED IN TWO POSITIONS THIS WAY ROUND 
AND REVERSED THAT WAY ROUND 
THESE STONES HAVE BEEN CARVED BY THE MASONS IN THEIR MASON'S YARD QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY 
THEN BROUGHT TO SITE ASSEMBLED TO FORM A HOLLOW DRUM VERY QUICKLY 
AND THAT WAS FILLED WITH RUBBLE AND MORTAR 
MEDIEVAL MASONS WERE NO STRANGERS TO SCAFFOLDING WOODEN SCAFFOLD TOWERS COULD BE BUILT TO ANY HEIGHT 
BUT IT WAS SKILLED WORK AND TOOK A LOT OF TIME AND USED A LOT OF TIMBER 
THE DURHAM ARCHITECTS CAME UP WITH A CUNNING ANSWER 
IN A SENSE THE CATHEDRAL ITSELF ACTS AS A PERMANENT SCAFFOLDING 
LOOK AT THIS LITTLE HOLE IT'S A PUTLOG HOLE 
THE CATHEDRAL WALL WAS BUILT UP TO THIS HEIGHT 
A HOLE LEFT CUT OUT OF THIS STONE SO THAT 
A TIMBER COULD BE INSERTED THUS 
AND THIS ALONG WITH OTHER TIMBERS IN HOLES TO LEFT AND RIGHT OF ME FORMED THE BASE OF A PLATFORM 
ON WHICH MASONS COULD WORK ABOVE 
AND THEN MOVE THE SCAFFOLDING TO THE NEXT PUTLOG HOLE AND SO ON RIGHT TO THE TOP OF THE BUILDING 
THE STONES IN THE WEST TOWERS COULD WEIGH ANYTHING UP TO A TON 
SIMPLY GETTING THEM UP THERE WAS A FORMIDABLE TASK 
LIFTING APPARATUS WAS BUILT INTO THE CATHEDRAL ITSELF 
THIS WINDLASS DATES FROM THE SEVENTEENTH OR EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
BUT IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED ORIGINALLY FIXED HIGH ABOVE THE NAVE 
TO LIFT GREAT STONES TO CONSTRUCT THE VAULT 
IT'S A WONDERFUL SURVIVAL THIS 
OOF GOSH 
THE WALLS OF THE CATHEDRAL ARE THREE F. T. THICK IN PLACES AND LOOK INCREDIBLY SOLID 
BUT THEY'RE HOLLOW AND FILLED WITH A MIXTURE OF BUILDERS' RUBBLE 
AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE MODERN CEMENT MORTAR MADE OF SAND AND LIME 
UP HERE YOU CAN SEE THE LIME MORTAR VERY WELL INDEED 
YOU CAN SEE VERY CLEARLY HOW IT'S BEEN POURED FROM ABOVE AGAINST A TIMBER MOULD TIMBER SHUTTERING 
JUST AS ONE WOULD POUR CONCRETE TODAY THESE MASONS IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TEN 
POURED THIS WONDERFUL MIXTURE OF LIME MORTAR INTO THE BOARDWORK 
AND THERE ARE SECTIONS OF THE TIMBER STILL SURVIVING VERY VERY MOVING 
THIS LIME MORTAR WAS WONDERFUL STUFF 
IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO HARDEN BUT THAT WAS GOOD BECAUSE IT HAD FLEXIBILITY A FORGIVING QUALITY 
AND WOULD ALLOW THE BUILDING TO SETTLE VERY GENTLY WITHOUT ANY CRACKING A GREAT MATERIAL 
WHILE WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE ARCHITECTS WERE 
THE BUILDING FOLLOWS A VERY DEFINITE IF MYSTERIOUS PLAN 
AS AT THE HEART OF EVERY CATHEDRAL EVER BUILT 
I'M STANDING BELOW THE CROSSING TOWER AT THE VERY CENTRE OF THE CATHEDRAL 
NOW IT TAKES THE FORM OF A LATIN CROSS WHICH IS MEANT TO REPRESENT THE BODY OF CHRIST 
BEHIND ME TO THE EAST IS THE HEAD 
TO LEFT AND RIGHT ARE THE TRANSEPTS THE ARMS 
IN FRONT OF ME TO THE WEST THE NAVE 
THAT'S THE LEGS 
WALKING THROUGH THE STRUCTURE OF THE CATHEDRAL 
IS AN AMAZING IF SOMEWHAT FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE 
IT REALLY IS LIKE PENETRATING A GREAT BODY 
THESE PASSAGEWAYS ARE LIKE THE VEINS 
THE CAPILLARIES THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
INCREDIBLE 
I AM WALKING THROUGH A MEDIEVAL MASON'S EVOCATION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 
THE LIFEBLOOD OF THIS GREAT BODY OF CHRIST WERE THE MONKS 
FLOWING THROUGH ITS HOLY SPACES LIKE BLOOD THROUGH VEINS THEIR DAY WAS PUNCTUATED WITH REGULAR SERVICES 
THIS MEANT THEIR CHANTING CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE CATHEDRAL 
ANIMATING IT BY ACOUSTIC RESONANCE AS WELL AS PHYSICAL PROCESSION 
FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE THEY CAN STILL TELL US SOMETHING OF THEIR DAILY LIFE 
THIS IS ONE OF THE DISTURBED 
THIS IS A MALE OBVIOUSLY ADULT 
THE GROUP AS A WHOLE HAD VERY POOR DENTAL HYGIENE 
THERE WAS RELIGIOUS RITUAL TO SOME FOOD 
ONE DAY A WEEK WAS FISH DAY 
BUT OTHERWISE IT'S MOSTLY MUTTON BEEF AND THAT SORT OF THING YES 
THE CATHEDRAL WAS A MAJOR ECONOMIC CENTRE 
SO YOU GET A VAST RANGE OF MATERIALS COMING FROM AROUND THE WORLD 
THROUGH TRADE ROUTES SPICES DATES GRAPES FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN 
THEY'RE NOT AUSTERE THESE BENEDICTINES THEY LIVED WELL 
AND EXPENSIVELY OBVIOUSLY 
FOOD WASN'T THEIR ONLY INDULGENCE 
CRIME WITHIN THE MONASTERY WAS NOT UNKNOWN 
WE KNOW THAT MONKS WERE ACCUSED OF SEXUAL INCONTINENCE WITH WOMEN OF THE TOWN 
CASES OF SODOMY WERE NOT UNKNOWN 
BUT FOR MORE SERIOUS CRIMES 
MONKS WHO WERE FOUND GUILTY WERE IMPRISONED IN THIS DUNGEON 
IN THIS BLEAK HOLE 
THEY HAD A VIEW THROUGH THAT HIGH WINDOW OF THE RIVER 
AND THAT WAS ABOUT IT 
JOHN TYNEMOUTH WHO'D ALREADY BEEN PUNISHED FOR STEALING MONASTIC PROPERTY AND DENYING HIS VOWS 
KILLED FELLOW MONK WILLIAM WARNER 
TYNEMOUTH LASTED SIX MONTHS IN THIS BLEAK CELL 
HE DIED IN AGONY HIS BODY RACKED BY CONSUMPTION FROM THE VAPOROUS AIR 
THE MAJORITY OF MONKS FOLLOWED A MORE RIGHTEOUS PATH 
BUT ON ONE OCCASION AN INNOCENT JAPE HAD A TRAGIC CONCLUSION 
THIS ROLL LISTS OBJECTIONS TO THE PRIOR OF THE MONASTERY 
ONE OF THE OBJECTIONS HERE IS THAT HE'S EFFECTIVELY GUILTY OF HOMICIDE 
IN THAT HE ALLOWED A TIGHTROPE WALKER TO PUT A ROPE FROM ONE OF THE CATHEDRAL TOWERS TO THE OTHER 
THEN THE PRIOR GOT HIM TO GO UP 
AND HE FELL OFF THE ROPE AND WAS KILLED 
I MEAN YOU'VE GOT THE TOWERS THERE 
AGNOSTICS AND ATHEISTS WOULD NOT I'M SURE BE WITHOUT WESTMINSTER ABBEY 
IT'S EASY TO FORGET HOW EXCITING WORSHIP WAS IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
FOR A START THE WHOLE BUILDING WAS BRIGHTLY EVEN GAUDILY PAINTED 
NOT THE COOL PLAIN STONE WE SEE TODAY 
WHEN PEOPLE CAME INTO THIS BUILDING 
THEY WERE HIT IMMEDIATELY BY A RIOT OF COLOUR 
THE COLOUR WAS TO HELP THEIR IMAGINATION 
THERE'S AN INSTANCE OF PERFORMANCE IN THE FESTIVAL OF THE ASCENSION 
BY A GREAT PAPIER MACHE CHRIST FIGURE WHICH WAS SUSPENDED TO THE CEILING 
AND AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN THE CELEBRATION OF THE MASS 
SOME BURLY MONKS WOULD HAUL ON ROPES 
AND THE FIGURE SHOT LITERALLY THROUGH THE ROOF 
AND PEOPLE CAME FROM MILES AROUND TO SEE THIS 
I THINK THAT THEY KNEW HOW TO HAVE A PARTY WHEN THEY CELEBRATED FEASTS 
IT WAS THE PEOPLE THE MONKS AND PILGRIMS WHO GAVE THE CATHEDRAL ITS SPIRITUAL VITALITY 
YET THERE'S ALSO SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE CONTAINED IN THE VERY STONES OF THE BUILDING 
THIS IS A VERY ODD COLUMN INDEED 
IN FACT UNIQUE IN THE CATHEDRAL 
BUILT IN ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THIS ZIG ZAG OR CHEVRON PATTERN APPEARS IN THE BUILDING 
BUT IT ONLY APPEARS FULLY ON THE LOWER PORTION OF THE COLUMN 
WHICH IS WHY IT'S SOMETIMES REGARDED AS A MISTAKE 
SHOWING THAT EVEN THESE GREAT MEDIEVAL MASONS COULD GET IT WRONG 
BECAUSE HERE IN THE STONE THE PATTERN CHANGES 
THE SO CALLED MISTAKE HAPPENS 
HERE WE HAVE THE UPSTROKES OF THE CHEVRON PATTERN 
AND THEN THE DOWNSTROKES HERE AND ABOVE OF THE SORT OF SPIRAL 
OBVIOUSLY THIS STONE COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN REPLACED 
IT HAPPENS AGAIN ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THERE WERE TWO MISTAKES 
IN A GREAT CATHEDRAL THERE ARE NO MISTAKES NO WHIMS OF MASONS 
WHICH COULD BE EASILY RECTIFIED 
TO MY MIND THIS COLUMN IS SAYING SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL 
ABOUT THIS PLACE ABOUT THIS SPACE 
THIS PLAN SHOWS THE CATHEDRAL AND THE ORIGINAL MONASTIC BUILDINGS 
WHICH WERE CONSTRUCTED AT THE SAME TIME SLIGHTLY BEFORE AND AFTER 
NOW LET'S SEE HOW THIS WORKS 
IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE ODD COLUMN IN THE SOUTH TRANSEPT 
WHICH IS HERE 
I THINK WE'LL SEE THAT IT IS THE AXIS 
AROUND WHICH THE WHOLE OF THE CATHEDRAL AND MONASTIC WORLD SPINS 
I OPEN THE COMPASS TO THE SOUTHERN POINT OF THE DEANERY 
WHERE THE PRIOR LIVED ORIGINALLY 
AND I TAKE THIS ROUND I DEFINE A CIRCLE 
WITH THE POINT PLACED ON THE ODD COLUMN 
I FIND MYSELF AT THE ORIGINAL EAST END OF THE CATHEDRAL 
SO IT DEFINES THE EXTENT OF THE CATHEDRAL 
THE CIRCLE NOW GOES THROUGH THE NORTH EDGE OF THE NORTH TRANSEPT 
THROUGH THE NAVE 
THROUGH ONE OF THE COLUMNS THAT'S FASCINATING 
AND MY GOODNESS IT ALSO DEFINES THE WEST EDGE OF THE CLOISTER 
THE HEART OF THE MONASTIC WORLD AROUND WHICH MONKS WOULD WALK AND PRAY AND MEDITATE 
AND BACK AGAIN OF COURSE TO THE DEANERY THE PRIOR SITS THERE 
SO IN THE CENTRE OF THIS CATHEDRAL WORLD IS THE COLUMN 
CLEARLY AS I SUSPECTED A VERY VERY IMPORTANT PLACE INDEED 
THE PIVOT AROUND WHICH ALL THIS SPINS SYMBOLISING I GUESS 
CHRIST HIMSELF IN A WAY 
THE FLAWED COLUMN THE MAN REJECTED BY OTHER MEN 
WHO TURNS OUT TO BE THE CORNERSTONE OF MANKIND OF SALVATION OF THE WHOLE OF CREATION 
EXTRAORDINARY 
THE SAME STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REFUSED 
IS BECOME THE HEADSTONE IN THE CORNER THIS IS THE LORD'S DOING 
AND IT IS MARVELLOUS IN OUR EYES 
IN FACT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DEVOTE THEIR LIVES TO UNRAVELLING THE GEOMETRY OF SACRED BUILDINGS 
THIS GEOMETRY IS IT ORGANISING THE CONSTRUCTION THE GEOMETRY OF THE PHYSICAL FORM OF THE BUILDING 
OR IS IT DEFINING A SACRED MEANING IN THE SPACE 
I THINK IT'S DOING BOTH 
THAT'S WHAT I FIND INTRIGUING WITH THE GEOMETRY THAT IT'S BOTH SACRED 
AND SYMBOLIC BUT IT'S ALSO A CONSTRUCTIONAL TOOL 
GEOMETRY WAS WHERE THEIR FAITH LAY 
IT GAVE THEM THE FAITH TO UNDERTAKE THESE PIONEERING CONSTRUCTIONS 
AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY INVESTED HOW COULD IT HAVE FALLEN DOWN 
SO GEOMETRY'S DOING IT 
A COMMON TEMPLATE FOR ELEVENTH CENTURY MASONS INVOLVED A MYSTERIOUS PATTERN OF SQUARES WHICH 
WHEN CORRECTLY ORIENTATED WOULD INVEST THE SPACES OF THE CATHEDRAL WITH VARIOUS DEGREES OF DIVINITY 
CONTEMPLATING THE PLAN OF THE CATHEDRAL SUGGESTS A GEOMETRICAL FORM THAT COULD UNDERLIE ITS DESIGN 
NOW THE MAIN PARTS OF THE CATHEDRAL FIT WITHIN A DOUBLE SQUARE 
A DOUBLE SQUARE WAS THE BASIS OF ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY USED GEOMETRICAL CONSTRUCTIONS 
IN THE ELEVENTH EARLY TWELFTH CENTURY 
NOW I'LL HAVE A GO AT DRAWING THIS 
NOW LET'S HAVE A LOOK WE HAVE OUR DOUBLE SQUARE 
FROM THE EAST END TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH EDGES OF THE TRANSEPTS 
AND THROUGH THE FONT AT THE WEST 
ON TOP OF THIS ARE THREE OTHER SQUARES 
AND THEY HAVE VERY POWERFUL CHRISTIAN MEANING 
THEY ARE THE HOLY TRINITY 
THEY DRAW INTO THE CHURCH THE POWER OF THE HOLY TRINITY 
HERE AT THE WEST THE SQUARE OF THE HOLY GHOST 
HERE AT THE EAST THE SQUARE OF JESUS CHRIST THE SON 
IN THE CENTRE THE FATHER FATHER SON AND HOLY GHOST 
THEY OVERLAP IN ONE PLACE RIGHT IN THE CENTRE 
RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE CHURCH 
WHAT'S FASCINATING IS THAT THIS SPECULATION DOES CERTAINLY AT THIS STAGE 
SEEM TO FIT THE BASIC FORM OF THE CATHEDRAL 
LET'S TEST THIS GEOMETRY AGAINST THE CATHEDRAL PROPER 
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN USE IT TO UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF THIS PLACE 
HERE WE HAVE THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE DOUBLE SQUARE 
GOING THROUGH THE FONT BEHIND ME 
THIS OF COURSE IS A VERY APPROPRIATE PLACE TO START THE ENTRANCE TO A SACRED PLACE 
BECAUSE THE FONT IS WHERE PEOPLE ENTER THE CHURCH THROUGH BAPTISM 
SO THIS IS LIKE A GREAT BAPTISTRY NOT PART OF THE SACRED SPACE ITSELF 
THIS IDEA IS REINFORCED BY THIS MARK ON THE FLOOR 
THIS DATES FROM THE MIDDLE AGES 
THIS IS THE MARK ACROSS WHICH WOMEN COULDN'T PASS 
THEY WERE KEPT TO THIS END THE NON SACRED PART OF THE CATHEDRAL 
I SHALL MAKE THE GREAT LEAP ACROSS THE DIVIDE AND GO ON 
I'M STANDING IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE EAST SQUARE 
THIS IS THE SQUARE OF THE SON 
WHERE MASS WAS SAID AND CHRIST'S BODY WAS MADE MANIFEST 
AND RIGHT ABOVE ME IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY VAULT 
IS THE IMAGE OF CHRIST HIMSELF THE LAMB OF GOD 
ON THIS DIAGONAL THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THIS SQUARE OVER THERE 
IS THE HIGHEST BISHOP'S THRONE IN CHRISTENDOM 
CLEARLY THE BISHOP HERE PUT HIMSELF ALMOST ON THE LEVEL OF CHRIST HIMSELF 
NOW I'M STANDING AT THE EASTERN TIP OF THE WEST SQUARE 
THIS MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE MOST SACRED PART OF THE CATHEDRAL 
HERE IN THE EAST MONKS WOULD CELEBRATE MASS OR CHANT 
AND RIGHT ABOVE ME IS THE EXTRAORDINARY THIRTEENTH CENTURY VAULT 
IT SHOWS A FIGURE CHRIST I'M SURE 
SUPPORTING IN A NET OR A BASKET THREE FIGURES 
THESE FIGURES I'M SURE REPRESENT THE HOLY TRINITY 
BECAUSE THAT'S THE GEOMETRY ON WHICH THIS CATHEDRAL IS BASED 
AND AS THE PLAN SHOWS 
THERE'S ONE POINT AT WHICH THE GEOMETRY COMES TOGETHER 
THIS IS THE PLACE OF UNITY OF ALL THREE IN ONE 
OF GODHEAD 
RIGHT ABOVE ME RISES A MASSIVE STONE TOWER INTO THE HEAVENS 
ASPIRING CAPTURING AS IT WERE SACRED ENERGY 
BRINGING IT DOWN INTO THE BODY OF THE CATHEDRAL 
THIS IS LIKE THE GREAT HEART OF THE BUILDING 
PUMPING ENERGY SACRED POWER AROUND THE MASSIVE BODY OF THE CHURCH 
IN THE MEDIEVAL AGE GEOMETRY WAS THE MOST HOLY OF THE SCIENCES 
TWO OF THE MOST SACRED GEOMETRIC FORMS WERE THE CIRCLE 
WHICH SYMBOLISED HEAVEN AND LIKE GOD IS WITHOUT BEGINNING OR END 
AND THE SQUARE WHICH REPRESENTED THE PHYSICAL WORLD 
THE GREAT CHALLENGE TO THE MEDIEVAL MIND WAS HOW TO COMBINE THE TWO 
TO BRING THE SPIRITUAL AND PHYSICAL WORLDS TOGETHER 
THE NAVE COLUMNS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT 
THEY ARE FATTER HERE'S ONE 
AND THEY ARE FULLY IN THE ROUND 
THE GIRTH OF THE COLUMN IS THE SAME AS THE HEIGHT 
THAT'S NOT JUST A PLEASANT CONCEIT 
IT'S VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT 
THAT GIVES THE COLUMN'S GIRTH AND HEIGHT A RELATIONSHIP OF ONE TO ONE 
THE SAME RELATIONSHIP ONE HAS IN A SQUARE 
ANOTHER THING IF ONE WERE TO CUT THE COLUMN DOWN THE MIDDLE AND UNPEEL IT 
THE COLUMN 
UNPEELED 
GIVES ONE A SQUARE AGAIN 
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING 
ONE OF THE OBSESSIONS WITH DESIGNS OF SACRED BUILDINGS IN THE PAST 
WAS TO RECONCILE THE GEOMETRICAL FORM OF THE SQUARE WITH THE CIRCLE 
THE SQUARE REPRESENTED THE MATERIAL WORLD THE CIRCLE THE SPIRITUAL 
WITH BOTH ON THE SAME SURFACE AREA ONE BROUGHT TOGETHER THE MATERIAL AND THE SACRED IN ONE CONSTRUCTION 
THAT IS WHAT THE DESIGNER OF THIS COLUMN HAS ACHIEVED 
AND THE SURFACE DECORATION OF THIS COLUMN IS ALL ABOUT SQUARES AND CURVES 
WHAT JUMPS OUT IMMEDIATELY IS THIS SORT OF DIAMOND SHAPE 
WHICH M. E. A S. U. R. E. S. TWELVE BY TWELVE 
INTERESTING COMPRESSED SQUARE 
AND OF COURSE IT IS SURROUNDED DEFINED BY 
THIS SORT OF NET PATTERN 
BUT SEE IT ANOTHER WAY 
THIS NET PATTERN IS ALSO A DOUBLE SPIRAL 
A DOUBLE HELIX 
AND OF COURSE SINCE THE DISCOVERY OF D. N. A. 
THE DOUBLE HELIX HAS BECOME THE GEOMETRY OF LIFE ITSELF 
THE MEDIEVAL SCIENCE OF SACRED GEOMETRY 
GAVE THE MASONS A VISION OF PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH OF THE MODERN AGE 
THE DOUBLE HELIX OF D. N. A. 
I SPENT HOURS IN THIS CATHEDRAL BY DAY AND BY NIGHT 
CRAWLING THROUGH IT CONTEMPLATING IT OBSERVING IT 
AND IT'S BEGINNING TO GIVE UP SOME OF ITS SECRETS 
I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND IT 
A CATHEDRAL DESIGNED IN THE IMAGE OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 
BUT TO THE MEDIEVAL MAN 
THIS BUILDING WAS MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE THAN THAT 
IT WAS THE BODY OF CHRIST HIMSELF LIVING AND BREATHING 
AND THAT'S NOT SO STRANGE REALLY 
IF YOU CONSIDER THE MYSTERY OF THE CATHOLIC MASS THAT WAS SAID HERE 
DURING THAT OF COURSE WINE AND BREAD IS TRANSFORMED INTO THE BODY OF CHRIST 
SO WHY NOT THE GREAT BODY OF THE CATHEDRAL BEING TRANSFORMED INTO THE BODY OF CHRIST 
THROUGH WORSHIP THROUGH RITUAL THROUGH BELIEF THROUGH FAITH 
THERE IS STILL CEREMONY AT DURHAM CATHEDRAL 
BUT IT'S HARD FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE MEANING OF THE BUILDING BECAUSE OF EVENTS FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION LED TO THE DESECRATION OF MANY RELIGIOUS SITES AND DURHAM DID NOT ESCAPE 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THE CULT OF SAINT CUTHBERT WAS OVERTURNED 
HIS TOMB OPENED AND HIS BODY STILL APPARENTLY UNCORRUPTED AND HIS BEARD OF A FORTNIGHT'S GROWTH 
WERE THROWN DOWN ONTO THE CATHEDRAL FLOOR 
THE BEASTS OF THE APOCALYPSE WERE SNAPPING AT CUTHBERT'S HEELS 
THE MONKS GATHERED UP HIS BODY AND SHARDS OF HIS COFFIN AND HID THEM 
AS FOR THE CATHEDRAL ITS INTERIOR WAS STRIPPED AND CUTHBERT ALL BUT FORGOTTEN 
THE CATHEDRAL NOT ONLY LOST MUCH OF ITS DECORATION ITS SPLENDOUR 
IT ALSO LOST MUCH OF ITS MEANING 
ITS STONES WERE RENDERED MUTE ITS MESSAGE OBSCURED 
IT WAS AS IF THE LONG AWAITED APOCALYPSE HAD FINALLY ARRIVED 
AND CERTAINLY THE REFORMATION WAS ONE OF THE MOST VANDALISTIC MOMENTS IN ENGLISH HISTORY 
BUT THE POWER OF THE CATHEDRAL SURVIVES 
IT TRANSCENDED THIS GREAT ASSAULT 
INDEED IT STILL HAS ITS PILGRIMS 
ITS SEEKERS AFTER TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE 
AND DID THOSE FEET IN ANCIENT TIMES 
WALK UPON ENGLAND'S MOUNTAINS GREEN 
AND WAS THE HOLY LAMB OF GOD 
ON ENGLAND'S PLEASANT PASTURES SEEN 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER
