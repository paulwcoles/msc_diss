FAMILY ARE GROWING EXTREMELY 
CONCERNED FOR MARK'S SAFETY HE WAS

FIANCEE NATASHA COLLINS DIED OF A 
DRUG OVERDOSE IN JANUARY 
MARK SPEIGHT AT QUEEN'S PARK TUBE 
STATION ON MONDAY WHERE HE WAS 
GOING STILL HASN'T BEEN ESTABLISHED 
AND NOW THOSE CLOSE TO THE 
PRESENTER WANT TO LET HIM KNOW HOW 
WORRIED THEY ARE 
I AM FEARING THE 
WORST BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER SEEN 
MARK LIKE THIS 
IN HAPPIER DAYS AS 
THE BRIGHT FRIENDLY FACE OF THE 
CHILDREN'S ART SHOW SMART AND LAST 
YEAR OUT WITH HIS FRIEND AND 
FIANCE 
THEY WERE A FANTASTIC FIANCE COUPLE THEY ABSOLUTELY IDOLISED 
EACH OTHER AND THEY WERE PERFECT 
FOR EACH OTHER

MARK DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID GET 
IN CONTACT WITH YOUR MUM YOUR 
FAMILY YOUR FRIENDS REALLY DO 
FEAR THE WORST AT THE MOMENT THIS 
MAN NEEDS TO BE FOUND QUICKLY 
COMING UP LATER IN THE PROGRAMME 
THE HOME OWNERS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE 
OF A PROPERTY SLOWDOWN 
BECAUSE OF THE BUILDING SOCIETIES 
AND HOLDING BACK ON MORTGAGES I 
THINK THINGS ARE JUST GOING TO GET 
WORSE WORSE PLUS WE TAKE A LOOK AT HOW 
CHILDREN IN NEED IS SPENDING THE 
MONEY THAT YOU HELPED RAISE 
THE B. B. C. HAS DISCOVERED THAT SOME 
LONDON DENTISTS ARE REFUSING TO 
TREAT SO CALLED HIGH NEEDS PATIENTS 
SEEKING N. H. S. TREATMENT EVEN THOUGH 
IT'S AGAINST OFFICIAL GUIDELINES 
THEY BLAME NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS 
FOR FORCING THEM TO TAKE THE ACTION 
MEET DENNIS A FORMER ALCOHOLIC WHO 
WAS HOMELESS FOR TEN YEARS A TIME 
IN WHICH HIS HEALTH AND HIS TEETH 
SUFFERED SEVERE NEGLECT ON TOP OF 
THAT THREE WEEKS AGO HE WAS PUNCHED 
IN THE MOUTH AND LOST ANOTHER 
COUPLE OF TEETH UNDER THE CURRENT 
GOVERNMENT CONTRACT HE IS PRECISELY 
THE KIND OF PATIENT THAT TODAY'S 
N. H. S. DENTISTS GIVES THEM 
NIGHTMARES THEY DON'T GET PAID ANY 
MORE FOR TREATING HIM THAN SOMEONE 
WHO NEEDS A SIMPLE FILLING HE HAS 
AGREED TO TEST DENTISTS FOR US AT 
THAT PRACTICE THEY'VE ALREADY MADE 
THEIR DECISION THEY NO LONGER TAKE 
N. H. S. PATIENTS POINTING OUT THAT 
SOMEONE AS NEEDY AS DENNIS IS A 
FINANCIAL LIABILITY IT'S IT'S INEVITABLE THERE ARE GOING TO BE 
SOME PATIENTS WHO ARE LESS 
ATTRACTIVE TO DENTISTS IT'S A 
STRESSFUL ENOUGH JOB AND IF A 
DENTIST FEELS THAT ACCEPTING A 
PATIENT IS GOING TO CAUSE PROBLEMS 
IN TERMS OF TIME ECONOMIC OUTLAY 
THEN IT'S ONLY NATURAL THEY'RE 
GOING TO THINK WELL ACTUALLY I 
WISH THIS PATIENT HADN'T COME IN 
THE NEW N. H. S. CONTRACT WAS DESIGNED 
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO 
REPLACE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH 
DENTISTS GOT PAID PERITEM OF WORK 
DONE WHAT USED TO BE KNOWN AS 
DRILL AND FILL 
WE WANT THEM TO WORK IN A SIMPLER 
WAY 
ISN'T THIS TOO SIMPLE HOW CAN WAY IT MAKE SENSE TO PAY THE SAME FOR 
DOING FIFTY MINUTES' OF WORK AS FOR 
MONTHS OF WORK 
IT'S NOT ABOUT 
LOOKING AT INDIVIDUAL ITEMS OF 
TREATMENT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE 
TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM L. WOULD 
HATE TO THINK ANY DENTIST WOULD 
WOULD PUT HIS OWN FINANCIAL GAIN IN 
FRONT OF THE CLINICAL KAEURB OF 
KAEURB OF CARE OF PATIENTS YOU 
PUT YOUR PATIENTS' RIGHTS AND 
WELFARE IN FRONT OF YOUR OWN THIS THIS STORY SHOULD END HAPPILY ENOUGH FOR 
DENNIS WHO CAN LOOK FORWARD TO A 
FINE SET OF TEETH SOON BUT IT'S 
SAOERPBS WITH SOME IF IF HIS 
EXPERIENCE WITH SOME DENTISTS IS 
ANYTHING TO GO BY OTHERS ARE 
GETTING A ROTTEN DEAL UNDER THE 
CURRENT N. H. S. CONTRACT 
YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW DENNIS GOT ON 
AT THE OTHER DENTISTS HE VISITED ON 
INAOEUD INSIDE SKWROP 
THE FORMER FORMER ANTI TERRORISM 
CHIEF AT THE METROPOLITAN POLICE 
HAS BEEN CLEARED OF ANY WRONGDOING 
FOLLOWING AN TPHAOEU INTO HIS 
EXPENSES ANDY HAYMAN RESIGNED AT 
THE END OF LAST YEAR AFTER HE FACED 
QUESTIONS ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF CLAIMS 
A SKILLER KILLER WHO SCRAWLED A 
CONFESSION ON A DOOR AT A REMAND 
CENTRE HAS BEEN JAILED FOR TWELVE YEARS 
DANIEL JOHNSON WAS SEVENTEEN WHEN SHE WAS 
STABBED AND BEATEN SO BADLY BY HER 
EX BOYFRIEND HER MOTHER COULDN'T 
EVEN RECOGNISE HER TODAY HER 
KILLER MARK KING BROMLEY WAS JAILED 
FOR HER MURDER 
MY SON ASKED ME 
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU 
GROW UP HE SAID ARE YOU GOING TO 
BE HERE MUMMY WHEN I GROW UP ARE 
YOU GOING TO GO OUT AND SOMEONE 
GOING TO ATTACK YOU 
NOW IT'S AN UNCERTAIN AND STRESSFUL 
TIME FOR MANY THINKING ABOUT BUYING 
OR SELLING A HOUSE NO ONE KNOWS 
QUITE HOW THE TURMOIL IN THE GLOBAL 
MARKETS WILL AFFECT PROPERTY PRICES 
HERE WHAT SEEMS CLEAR THOUGH IS 
THAT THE HOUSING MARKET IS SLOWING 
DOWN AND THAT'S MAKING IT HARDER 
FOR ANYONE HOPING TO MOVE HOME 
SARAH HARRIS HAS BEEN TO MEET SOME 
LONDONERS IN THIS PREDICAMENT 
SAINT ALBANS ONE OF THE MOST SOUGHT 
AFTER PLACES TO LIVE IN THE SOUTH 
EAST WHERE ONCE BUYERS WERE 
FIGHTING OVER TWO BEDROOM COTTAGES 
FOR MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT ALL IS 
NOT WELL INSIDE THE HISTORIC WALLS 
CHRISTINE HAS HAD HER PROPERTY ON 
THE MARKET FOR SIX MONTHS AND EVEN 
DROPPING THE PRICE BY PWDZ FORTY FIVE 
FORTY FIVE THOUSAND HAS MADE NO DIFFERENCE SHE 
THINKS GORDON BROWN SHOULD BE DOING 
MORE TO HELP 
I THINK HE SHOULD 
HAVE ABOLISHED STAMP DUTY FOR 
FIRST TIME BUYERS THAT WOULD HAVE 
GOT THEM INTO THE MARKET THEY 
WOULD HAVE PUSHED THE OTHER PEOPLE 
FORWARD AND IT WOULD HAVE HELPED 
EVERYBODY BECAUSE OF THAT AND 
BECAUSE OF THE BUILDING SOCIETIES 
AND HOLDING BACK ON MORTGAGES I 
THINK THINGS ARE JUST GOING TO GET 
WORSE 
SAINT ALBANS HAS ALWAYS BEEN WORSE POPULAR WITH HOUSE BUYERS WITH 
GREAT RAIL LINKS INTO LONDON BUT 
ESTATE AGENTS ARE ADVISING CLIENTS 
TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IN THE MARKET AND BELIEVE 
MANY NOW ACCEPT THINGS COULD GET 
WORSE 
THEY ARE LISTENING TO WHAT'S WORSE HAPPENING IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS 
AND BEGINNING TO REALISE PERHAPS 
THEY SHOULD COME TO THE MARKET NOW 
RATHER THAN WAIT UNTIL THE SUMMER 
WHEN PRICES MAY BE AFFECTED MORE BY 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
SOME REPORTS SUGGEST IN LONDON 
THINGS ARE HOLDING UP A LITTLE 
BETTER BUT THAT'S NOT BEEN THE 
EXPERIENCE OF THIS COUPLE FROM 
MUSWELL HILL WHO ARE STILL WAITING 
FOR AN OFFER ON THEIR PROPERTY 
AFTER SIX MONTHS 
WE DO FEEL WE 
HAVE MISSED THE BOAT IF WE PUT IT 
ON THE MARKET THIS TIME LAST YEAR 
IT WOULD HAVE FLOWN OUT THE DOOR 
NOW VERY SLOW 
WE ARE GOING 
LITERALLY IN A WEEK 
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOME HOUSES 
THAT WILL SELL EASILY THAN OTHERS 
BUT AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF GROWTH 
DROPPING THE PRICE OF YOUR HOUSE IS 
NEVER GOING TO BE EASY 
PROPERTY JOURNALIST MIRA HILLEL 
JOINS ME NOW WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE 
STAY PUT AND RIDE IT OUT FOR SELL 
FAST 
IF YOU NEED TO SELL FOR AN FAST IMPORTANT REASON LIKE A JOB MOVE 
OR A DIVORCE OR WORSE THEN SELL 
NOW AND BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE 
PRICE YOU CAN ASK FOR A HIGH PRICE 
BUT TELL YOUR AGENT IF A LOW OFFER 
COMES IN YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR 
ABOUT IT AND CONSIDER IT AND WHEN 
YOU RECEIVE A LOW OFFER CONSIDER 
THAT IT MAY BELOWER YET AGAIN IN 
THREE OR SIX MONTHS' TIME 
SO BE 
REALISTIC WITH EXPECTATIONS YES YES THERE WILL BE LOT OF VIEWERS 
WATCHING WHO REMEMBER THE CRASH OF 
THE EIGHTIES DO YOU THINK IT WILL GO 
THAT FAR 
NO THE CRASH OF THE EIGHTIES 
WAS A RESULT OF A REGIME WHERE 
INFLATION WAS HIGH INTEREST RATES 
WERE VERY HIGH PEOPLE COULDN'T 
AFFORD TO KEEP UP THEIR MORTGAGE 
REPAYMENTS AND REPOSSESSED AT ONE THOUSAND 
A WEEK THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
MORTGAGE RATES HOWEVER HIGH THEY GO 
WILL NOT BE NEARLY LIKE THE TWELVE FIFTEEN PER CENT 
I REMEMBER WELL FROM THOSE DAYS AND 
PEOPLE COULDN'T AFFORD TO STAY IN 
THEIR HOMES WITH THOSE INTEREST 
RATES 
OF COURSE IF FOR A LOT OF RATES PEOPLE THE ADVICE IS STAY PUT 
UNLESS THEY HAVE TO SELL IT WILL 
BE AN EXPENSIVE STAYING PUT 
BECAUSE MORTGAGE LENDERS OF COURSE 
AREN'T GIVING THE SAME FAVOURABLE 
DEALS THEY WERE GIVING WHEN PEOPLE 
FIRST BOUGHT THEIR HOMES THEY THEY WON'T GIVE THEM WHEN YOU ARE MOVING 
EITHER SO THAT WILL BE A MUTUAL 
THING THE FACT THE MARKET WILL 
SROE DOWN ALREADY SALES IN LONDON 
DOWN FIFTY PER CENT YEAR ON YEAR THIS IS BAD 
NEWS FOR ESTATE AGENTS BUT NOT 
REALLY BAD NEWS FOR ANYBODY ELSE 
UNLESS THEY'RE IN A DES PAEUT 
SITUATION NEEDING TO SELL OR 
NEEDING TO BUY I WOULD SAY TO 
ANYONE THINKING OF BUYING NOW 
DON'T BUY NOW BECAUSE IN SIX 
MONTHS' TIME NINE MONTHS' IN A 
YEAR'S TIME PRICES ARE BOUND TO BE 
A LITTLE LOWER 
WELL JUST BRIEFLY COMMENTATORS WE 
HEARD SAYING THAT LONDON WON'T BE 
HIT IN THE SAME WAY AS THE REST OF 
THE COUNTRY DO YOU AGREE 
I WISH I 
COULD FOR THE SAKE OF LONDON BUT 
NO I DON'T THINK SO L. THINK THE 
TOP END OF THE MARKET WHICH HAS A 
LIFE OF ITS OWN ON ITS OWN PLANET 
PROPERTY BUT THE REST OF THE 
MARKET IS BEING CURRENTLY PROPPED 
UP BY THOSE CRAZY PRICES STILL 
BEING PAID AT THE AT THE TEN 
MILLION PLUS THE REST OF THE 
MARKET WILL BEHAVE INEVITABLY THE 
SAME AS THE REST OF THE U. K. EXCEPT 
FROM A MUCH HIGHER BASE OF PRICE 
WHICH WILL MAKE IT ALL THE MORE 
DIFFICULT FOR FIRST TIME BUYERS TO 
GET IN 
THANK YOU

THIS YEAR THAT GETS TURNED RIGHT 
ROUND ROUND IT WILL BE SUNDAY IT WILL BE 
SUNNY BUT QUITE COLD SO DON'T TAKE

WILL GET SOME SQUALLY SHOWERS 
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AND OVER THE NEXT 
FEW NIGHTS AND WE WILL GET SOME 
WET WEATHER OVER THE LONDON AREA 
TOMORROW A SUNNY START TO THE

THE SHOWERS KEPT GOING RATHER LIKE 
TODAY SOME WILL BE HEAVY AND 
THUNDERY THEY WILL GO ALONG QUITE 
BRISKLY THE THIRTEEN CELSIUS THEY ARE 
LIKELY TO GET AT WHITE HART LANE 
TOMORROW IS A PRETTY GOOD GUIDE FOR 
THE TEMPERATURES 
IF WE DO GET ANY THUNDERY SHOWERS 
ON SUNDAY THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO 
BE TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF LONDON
