AMERICA'S MILITARY COMMANDER 
CAUTIONS AGAINST REMOVING TROOPS 
TOO QUICKLY GEORGE BUSH'S TOP MEN 
STATE TWO CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS 
THAT THE SURGE IS WORKING BUT IT IS 
SHAKY 
OUR CURRENT COURSE IS SHAKY WORKING PROGRESS IS REAL AND 
FRAGILE WE NEED TO STAY WITH IT 
WILL BE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY COME TO 
A HALT IN SAN FRANCISCO THE 
OLYMPIC COMMITTEE MEETS IN BEIJING 
TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO A LOW TURNOUT 
IN EGYPT'S ELECTIONS AFTER STREET 
PROTESTS AND CALLS FOR BOYCOTTS 
FROM THE OPPOSITION A GERMAN 
RESTAURANT COMES UP WITH A UNIQUE 
SOLUTION FOR GETTING RID OF BAD 
SERVICE BY HAVING NO WAITERS 
HELLO AND WELCOME HOW SOON CAN WE 
GET OUT OF IRAQ THAT WAS THE KEY 
QUESTION AT CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS 
IN WASHINGTON TODAY THE TOP 
MILITARY BRASS IS URGING CAUTION 
ALL EYES WERE ON THREE SENATORS ON 
THAT COMMITTEE JOHN MCCAIN HILARY 
CLINTON AND BAG ALL THREE OF THEM 
WERE USING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SET 
OUT THEIR STALLS ON A RACK 
BARACK OBAMA JOHN MCCAIN ARGUED 
AGAINST WHAT HE CALLED A RECKLESSLY 
IRRESPONSIBLE PULL OUT HILARY 
CLINTON SAID IT IS TIME FOR AN 
ORDERLY WITHDRAWAL FROM IRAQ OUR 
CORRESPONDENT HAS BEEN FOLLOWING 
THIS FIVE YEARS ON AND U. S. TROOPS 
ARE STILL FIGHTING A WAR WITH NO 
END IN SIGHT ATTACKS LIKE THIS MAY 
BE DOWN BUT FOUR THOUSAND U. S. TROOPS HAVE 
ALREADY DIED AMERICA'S SENIOR 
MILITARY COMMANDER CLAIMED PROGRESS 
IS BEING MADE 
IF YOU KICK TAKE 
THIS GENTLEMAN OUT 
IN TWO STILL AN 
UNPOPULAR FOR COULD IT IS STILL 
AN UNPOPULAR WAR IT WAS TALK OF 
FACING THE CHALLENGE 
IN SOME AREAS 
IT IS STILL UNSATISFACTORY AS 
EVENTS IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS HAVE 
REMINDED US AND AS I HAVE CAUTIONED 
THE PROGRESS MADE SINCE LAST SPRING 
IS FRAGILE AND REVERSIBLE BERAHLE BERAHLE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND U. S. TROOPS IN IRAQ THERE 
ARE NOW THE AIM IS TO REDUCE THAT 
TO ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND TROOPS BY THE SUMMER 
THERE ARE NO FURTHER PLANS FOR 
REDUCTIONS AFTER THAT HOW MUCH 
LONGER WILL AMERICAN TROOPS STAYED 
IN IRAQ THAT IS A QUESTION FOR 
THEIR NEXT PRESIDENT JOHN MCCAIN'S 
COMMITMENT IS OPEN ENDED HE HAS 
SENT TROOPS COULD STAY IN IRAQ FOR 
ONE HUNDRED YEARS IF NECESSARY 
I HOPE FOR 
ANORAK WHICH NO LONGER NEEDS 
AMERICAN TROOPS I BELIEVE WE CAN 
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL SOONER THAN WE 
CAN IMAGINE 
BARACK OBAMA SAYS HE 
WILL PULL OUT TROOPS WITHIN SIXTEEN 
MONTHS HILARY CLINTON IS PROMISING 
A PHASED WITHDRAWAL 
WE ARE HALFWAY 
THROUGH THE YEAR AS MANY OF US 
PREDICTED AND AS YOU STATED WE 
STILL DO NOT SEE SUFFICIENT 
PROGRESS 
WITH THE ELECTION PROGRESS CAMPAIGN WELL UNDER WAY THE IRAQ 
WAR IS NOT SUCH A PROBLEM FOR 
AMERICAN BURGE CUP FOR PRESIDENT 
BUSH MORE A DILEMMA FOR HIS 
PREDECESSOR SUCCESSOR THE 
QUESTION NOW PARTICULARLY FOR THE 
DEMOCRATS IS CAN THEY AFFORD TO 
IGNORE HIS ADVICE AND BRING ABOUT A 
SPEEDY END TO THE WAR TO DISCUSS 
SOME OF THAT I AM JOINED BY JUDITH 
KIPPER OF THE INSTITUTE OF WORLD 
AFFAIRS HOW IMPORTANT ARE THESE 
HEARINGS IN A MATTER 
YES I THINK 
THEY MATTER VERY MUCH DO THEY 
MATTER THE REPORTS ARE BY TWO A 
HIGHLY RESPECTED U. S. OFFICIALS THEY 
COULD SAY NOTHING BUT THINGS ARE 
PEACEFUL AND QUIET WHICH WOULD 
SATISFY THE CONGRESS OR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE AT THIS STAGE THEY THEY HAVE ASSUMED GREAT IMPORTANCE 
BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATES ON THOSE COMMITTEES 
HAVEN'T THEY 
I AM NOT SURE THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TURNED AGAINST 
THIS WAR IT IS NOT ABOUT WHAT THE 
THREE CANDIDATES THINK AT THIS 
MOMENT IT IS MORE ABOUT THE BURDEN 
THE STRESS THE COST THE DEATHS 
THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THE U. S. IS 
FACING SO AT ANY THOSE ISSUES ARE 
WHAT MOTIVATES AMERICANS TO VOTE 
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER EACH OF THE 
CANDIDATES WILL SPINET ACCORDING TO 
WHAT THEY HAVE ALREADY SAID NONE 
OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE 
IRRESPONSIBLE ALL OF THEM WILL 
LISTEN TO COMMANDOS AND NOT DO 
ANYTHING THAT WILL JEOPARDISE 
AMERICAN INTEREST US ALL THE IRAQI 
FUTURE 
IT WAS QUITE INTERESTING TO FUTURE SEE HILARY CLINTON IN A WEIGHT 
OPENLY DISAGREEING WITH THE TOP 
MILITARY BRASS WAY WE HEAR THEM 
SAYING THEY CANNOT WITHDRAW QUICKLY 
THAT THEY'RE SAYING AND WE HAVE 
GOT TO GET OUT THAT IS QUITE A 
DANGEROUS STRATEGY 
I DO NOT THINK 
SO AMERICAN COMMANDERS CAN TALK 
ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON ON THE 
GROUND ALL OF THEM INCLUDING 
GENERAL PETRAEUS WHO IS A FIRST 
RATE GENERAL FROM PRINCETOWN AND SO 
ONE HAVE SAID THERE IS NO MILITARY 
SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IF THE 
SURGE IS WORKING WHY IS THERE 
FIGHTING IN BAGHDAD TODAY WHY WERE 
THREE AMERICAN SOLDIERS KILLED 
YESTERDAY QUESTIONING THE MILITARY 
PART OF THIS IS PERFECTLY 
LEGITIMATE THERE IS NO MILITARY 
SOLUTION ONLY AN IRAQI 
RECONCILIATION A RECONSTRUCTION OF 
AND CHANGE IN ATTITUDE IN POLICY BY 
THE U. S. AND THE IRAQIS IS LIKELY TO 
STABILISE THE SITUATION TO THE 
EXTENT THAT THE U. S. CAN BEGIN TO BE 
DEPLOYED AND ULTIMATELY WITHDRAW 
FROM IRAQ THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME 
THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT CAME IN FOR 
QUITE A LOT OF CRITICISM 
YES IT 
IS EASY TO CRITICISE THE IRAQI 
GOVERNMENT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE 
TOOLS BY WHICH IT CAN REALLY GOVERN 
THE COUNTRY A DOES NOT HAVE 
CONTROL OF THE ARMED MILITIA IT 
DOES NOT THE POLICE FORCE IS 
QUESTIONABLE THERE IS LESS 
ELECTRICITY NOW THAN BEFORE THE WAR 
THE SECURITY OF PEOPLE TAKING THEIR 
KIDS TO SCHOOL AND GOING SHOPPING 
A LOT OF ISSUES THAT ARE PROMOTING 
A LOT OF LACK OF STABILITY IN IRAQ 
ARE NOT ISSUES THAT THE IRAQI 
GOVERNMENT IS CAPABLE OF HANDLING 
IT IS EASY TO PLAY IN THEM A DO 
HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY THEY DO 
HAVE 
THANK YOU WELL THE OLYMPIC HAVE FLAME CONTINUES TO FLICKER ACROSS 
THE WORLD DESPITE THE PROTESTS IT 
HAS ARRIVED OF THE WEST COAST OF 
THE UNITED STATES FOR 
LEG OF ITS RELAY AHEAD OF THE 
BEIJING GAMES IN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE DAYS' TIME 
AFTER THOSE CHAOTIC SCENES THAT WE 
SAW IN LONDON AND PARIS WHETHER 
PROGRESS OF THE FLAME WAS DISRUPTED 
BY PRO TIBET PROTESTERS THE 
INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE IS 
LOOKING AT WHETHER THE JOURNEY 
SHOULD BE STOPPED ALTOGETHER THE 
OLYMPIC MOVEMENT WILL BE WATCHING 
SAN FRANCISCO WITH TREPIDATION AS 
THE BEIJING TORTURE CONTINUES ITS 
DISASTROUS JOURNEY AROUND THE WORLD 
SHOULD THERE BE MORE TROUBLE THIS 
COULD BE THE LAST FOREIGN CITY IT 
VISITS PEACE AND HARMONY WERE 
MEANT TO BE THE WATCHWORD OF THIS 
GATHERING OF THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT 
IN BEIJING A PAT ON THE BACK FOR 
THE CHINESE FOUR MONTH AHEAD OF THE 
GAMES THAT HAS CHANGED TALKING TO 
I. O. C. MEMBERS I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT 
CHINA WAS REPEATEDLY WARNED BY 
HEIGHT OLYMPIC OFFICIALS NOT TO 
HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL TORCH RELAY 
IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE OLYMPIC 
BRAND HAS BEEN DAMAGED AND THERE IS 
A GROWING FEELING THAT IT SHOULD 
SAN FRANCISCO GO THE WAY OF PARIS 
OR LONDON AT THE INTERNATIONAL 
TORCH RELAY MAY HAVE TO BE 
CURTAILED IF NOT CANCELLED A 
DECISION ON THAT MIGHT BE TAKEN 
LATER THIS WEEK THE INTERNATIONAL 
OLYMPIC COMMITTEE PRESIDENT WILL 
CHAIR A BOARD MEETING 
WE WILL 
DISCUSS THIS AND SEE WHAT WE HAVE 
TO LOOK AT WE WILL SEE WHAT KIND 
OF CONCLUSIONS WE WILL HAVE TO TAKE 
THE PROTESTS BEGAN AS SOON AS THE 
FLAME WAS LIT IN OLYMPIA THE 
BIRTHPLACE OF THE OLYMPICS IT 
INTENSIFIED THROUGH ITS THIRTY ONE MILE 
ORDEAL THROUGH LAND IN LONDON 
THE FLAME WAS EXTINGUISHED ON ITS 
WAY TO PARIS ALL THIS HAS MADE 
EVEN GREAT OLYMPIANS QUESTION 
WHETHER THE JOURNEY IS WORTHWHILE 
HAVING SEEN WHAT I HAD SEEN AND 
WITNESSED ON SUNDAY IT WOULD NOT 
BE A BAD IDEA PEOPLE ARE LINING 
THE STREETS TO SEE THE TORCH FOR 
THE RIGHT REASONS THEY ARE NOT 
GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY TO FEEL THE 
OLYMPIC SPIRIT AND POSSIBLY NOT 
EVEN SEE THE TORCH AT ALL 
THE I. O. C. 
MUST NOW DECIDE HOW BEST TO RESTORE 
WHAT TARNISHED OF THE TARNISHED 
IMAGE OF THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT 
JOINING ME TO TALK ABOUT THAT 
MEETING IS OUR SPORTS CORRESPONDENT 
WHAT YOU THINK THEY ARE LIKELY TO 
DECIDE 
IT IS A NO WIN SITUATION DECIDE IF THE PLUG IS PULLED ON THE RELAY 
IT IS HUMILIATING FOR THE CHINESE 
THEY ARE TRYING TO SPREAD THE 
MESSAGE OF A NEW CHINA A CHANNEL FOUR 
THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THAT IS WHAT THE 
I. O. C. WANTED TO HAPPEN A CHINA FOR 
THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IF HE TENSE THAT 
WILL BE MORE THAN JUST EMBARRASSING 
FOR THE CHINESE IF IT CONTINUES 
IT COULD GO ON TO CAMERA WHERE WE 
ALREADY KNOW THEY ARE PROTESTS 
PLANNED CANBERRA THERE REALLY 
IS NO WAY OUT MY INSTINCT WOULD BE 
THAT THIS RELATES WILL CONTINUE 
THEY HAVE GOT SOME OF THE HARDEST 
LEGS BEHIND THEM IN TERMS OF 
PROTESTS 
THIS DECISION IS UP TO PROTESTS THE I. O. C. BUT TO WHAT EXTENT CAN MOVE 
IN THE FACE OF CHINESE OPPOSITION 
IF THEY ARE DETERMINED TO CARRY ON 
WITH THE RELAY IT WILL CARRY ON 
IT WILL BE EMBARRASSING IF THEY 
WERE TOLD TO STOP AND INSENSITIVE 
IF THERE WAS A DECISION I'M SURE 
IT WILL BE TAKEN WITH THE FULL CO 
OPERATION OF THE BEIJING OFFICIALS 
IT IS HARD IF YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT 
THEY HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH ONLY 
IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS THE ISSUE OF 
TIBET HAS HAD SO MUCH PUBLIC 
ATTENTION ALL THE PLANS HAVE HAD 
TO BE CHANGED THE IMAGES THEY 
THOUGHT WOULD BE SENT OUT TO THE 
WORLD HAVE NOW BECOME THE REVERSE 
ARE THERE ANY HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS 
FOR CANCELLING THE RELAY NOTHING NOTHING LIKE THIS SOMEONE TRIED TO PUT OUT 
THE FLAME IN THE TWO THOUSAND WITH A FIRE 
EXTINGUISHER BUT NOTHING TO COMPARE 
WITH THIS IT IS ON A TRULY GLOBAL 
SCALE PEOPLE IN THE FREE TIBET 
MOVEMENT HAVE GOT MORE PUBLICITY 
THAN THEY HAVE EVER DREAMT OF 
BECAUSE THE FLAME IS GOING AROUND 
THE WORLD 
VIOLENCE HAS RETURNED TO 
THE STREETS OF THE KENYAN CAPITAL 
HUNDREDS OF ANGRY YOUTHS HURLED 
ROCKS AND SET FIRE IN NAIROBI'S 
LARGEST SLUM KENYA'S OPPOSITION 
PARTY HAS SUSPENDED TALKS WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF WHAT IT SAYS 
IS THE PRESIDENT'S FAILURE TO KEEP 
AN AGREEMENT TO SHARE POWER FAILURE

THIS NOISE IS COMING 
FROM RAW ELEMENTS SPEAKING ON 
BEHALF OF THE FIGHTERS THESE ARE 
MISGUIDED POLITICAL MISDEEDS 
MISFITS 
THE WAITING IS WEIGHING HEAVY ON AN 
EXPECTANT NATION TWO WORKERS AND A 
PAKISTANI ATOMIC ENERGY SIDE HAD 
BEEN KILLED BY AN EXPLOSION IT'S 
THOUGHT TO BE CAUSED BY GAS LEAK 
IT HAPPENED AT THE HEAVY WATER 
PLANT AT KHUSHAB IN PUNJAB PROVINCE 
DURING ITS ANNUAL MAINTENANCE CHECK 
PAKISTAN'S ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION 
SAY THERE HAS BEEN NO LEAK OF 
RADIATION THE U. S. STATE DEPARTMENT 
HAS ORDERED ON NON ESSENTIAL STAFF 
TO LEAVE THE U. S. EMBASSY IN YEMEN 
THIS COMES A DAY AFTER AL QAEDA 
SAID IT WOULD CARRY AN ATTACK ON A 
RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX USED BY 
WESTERNERS IN THE CAPITAL NO ONE 
WAS INJURED SEVEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
ARRESTED COLUMBIA'S F. A. R. C. 
GUERRILLAS HAVE REFUSED TO ALLOW A 
HUMANITARIAN HUMANITARIAN MISSION 
INCLUDING DOCTOR SENT BY FRANCE TO SEE 
THE FRENCH COLOMBIAN HOSTAGE SHE 
IS THE HIGHEST PROFILE HOSTAGE HELD 
BY THE REBELS AND IS BELIEVED TO BE 
SERIOUSLY ILL AFTER SIX YEARS IN 
CAPTIVITY THERE HAS BEEN A LOW 
TURNOUT IN THE EGYPTIAN LOCAL 
ELECTIONS AFTER TWO DAYS OF 
PROTESTS AND CALLS FOR A BOYCOTT BY 
THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY OVER 
FIFTY THOUSAND LOCAL COUNCILLORS ARE BEING 
SELECTED FIFTEEN THOUSAND THE CANDIDATES 
ARE STANDING UNOPPOSED IN THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF SEATS ONLY TWENTY 
CANDIDATES AFFILIATED TO THE 
OPPOSITION MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD HAVE 
BEEN ALLOWED TO STAND THIS IS THE 
BACKDROP TO TODAY'S ELECTIONS ON 
SUNDAY THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS 
TORCHED BUILDINGS LOOTED SHOPS AND 
CLASHED WITH POLICE AFTER THEY 
TRIED TO STOP THE STRIKE GOING 
AHEAD IN THE NILE DELTA TOWN 
SOARING FOOD PRICES AND LOW WAGES 
HAVE STRENGTHENED THIS CONTENT WITH 
MORE BARAK'S GOVERNMENT THE 
OPPOSITION MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SAID 
THAT MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND OF ITS MEMBERS 
AND POTENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN 
ARRESTED AHEAD OF THE MUNICIPAL 
ELECTIONS WHICH IS WHY IT WANTS A 
BOYCOTT 
WE CALL ON BOYCOTT PEOPLE TO BOYCOTT THIS ELECTION OUT 
OF RESPECT TO LEGITIMACY SANCTIONED 
BY THE COURTS AND GOVERNMENT WE 
WILL CONTINUE TO FACE UP TO 
CORRUPTION AND PEACEFULLY PURSUE 
CHANGE AND REFORM THROUGH ALL THE 
UNCONSTITUTIONALLY CHANNELS SO AS 
TO ACHIEVE PROGRESS FOR OUR NATION 
PRESIDENT MUBARAK PATEL IS SEVENTY NINE YEARS 
OLD THIS IS HIS FOURTH CONSECUTIVE 
TERM IN OFFICE AT THE MOMENT HE 
HAS NO OBVIOUS SUCCESSOR AND HE 
SHOWS NO SIGNS OF WANTING TO LOOSEN 
HIS GRIP ON POWER THE MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD HAS ACCUSED THE 
GOVERNMENT OF PUTTING BUREAUCRATIC 
OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF ITS 
CANDIDATES IT HAD HOPED TO FIELD 
TEN THOUSAND BUT SINCE REGISTRATION FOR 
THE BALLACK BEGAN ON MARCH FOURTH 
ONLY TWENTY HAVE MANAGED TO OFFICIALLY 
REGISTER AS CANDIDATES THE 
BALLOT THERE HAS BEEN SILENCE FROM 
WASHINGTON CRITICS COMPLAIN THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE LITTLE TO 
CONDEMN THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT 
SURPRISING WHEN YOU CONSIDER THIS 
SPEECH THAT CONDOLEEZZA RICE MADE 
JUST THREE YEARS AGO IN CAIRO FOR FOR SIXTY YEARS MY COUNTRY THE UNITED 
STATES PURSUED STABILITY AT THE 
EXPENSE OF DEMOCRACY IN THIS REGION 
HERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND WE 
ACHIEVE NEITHER NOW WE ARE TAKING 
A DIFFERENT COURSE WE ARE 
SUPPORTING THE DEMOCRATIC 
ASPIRATIONS OF ALL PEOPLE 
BUT IN 
JANUARY ON HIS VISIT TO EGYPT 
GEORGE BUSH WAS EXTREMELY CAREFUL 
NOT TO CRITICISE PRESIDENT IRAQ HE 
IS AFTER ALL A CLOSE ALLY OF THE 
UNITED STATES PRESTON MUBARAK 
MANY SAY THAT THE ENTHUSIASM FOR 
SPREADING DEMOCRACY HAS DIMINISHED 
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND THE STATUS QUO IN 
OEDIPAL ONLY CHANGE ONCE THEY 
PRESIDENT HAS GONE ON MONDAY 
POLICE FIRED TEAR GAS AGAINST 
PROTESTERS AGAIN THE CLASHES WERE 
SPARKED AFTER SOME PROTESTERS TORE 
DOWN A BILLBOARD OF THE PRESIDENT 
AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED 
AND FIFTEEN PROTESTERS AND FIVE POLICE 
OFFICERS WERE HURT NO WONDER A LOT 
OF VOTERS HAVE NOT BOTHERED TO TURN 
UP AT THE POLLING STATIONS TODAY 
THE ROAD TO DEMOCRACY IN EGYPT IS A 
ROCKY ONE JOINING THE IS AHMED 
MUSTAFA AN EGYPTIAN JOURNALIST TO 
US WITH THE B. B. C.'S ARABIC SERVICE 
DO YOU THINK THE LOW TURNOUT TODAY 
IS DUE TO THIS CALL FOR A BOYCOTT 
BY THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OR DO 
YOU THINK EGYPTIANS ARE JUST PRETTY 
DISILLUSIONED IN GENERAL IN IN GENERAL YES THE ELECTIONS IN 
EGYPT ALWAYS HAVE A LOW TURNOUT 
THIS ELECTION IN PARTICULAR AT SEVENTY 
PER CENT OF THE SEATS HAVE ALREADY GONE TO 
THE RULING PARTY PEOPLE SEE NO 
POINT LOCAL ELECTIONS ARE NOT AS 
IMPORTANT IN EGYPT AS GENERAL BUT 
THIS TIME IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THREE 
YEARS AGO WHICH ACQUIRED ANY 
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENCY TO HAVE 
THE SUPPORT OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY M. P.'S AND LOCAL 
COUNCILLORS IT SEEMED THE RULING 
PARTY IS SAYING AT THE SAME TO A 
CERTAIN CANDIDATE 
THIS THE FIRST 
STAGE IN THEM RATING THE EVENTUAL 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
WE DON'T 
WANT TO BE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 
LAST PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS 
FOR M. P.'S THAT IN WHICH THE MUSLIM 
PRESIDENT AND OTHER OPPOSITION GOT 
SOME SEATS THEY DON'T WANT ANY 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD THIS IS THE MAIN 
OPPOSITION GROUP WHAT IS THEIR 
STATUS BECAUSE THEY ARE 
TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL BUT THEY DO 
HAVE SOME M. P.'S THEY ARE STANDING IN 
SOME SEATS BUT NOT MOST 
I THINK 
THIS IS THE SORT OF POLITICAL 
HYPOCRISY EITHER FROM THE SIDE OF 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OR THE SIDE 
OFF THE RULING PARTY 
WHAT YOU MEAN 
BY THAT 
YOU SEE THIS POLITICAL 
OPPORTUNISM FROM THE MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD TO CALL FORWARD THEY 
HAVE BEEN HOGGING ALL THE TIME OF 
THE REGIME IS GOING TO AT LEAST LET 
THEM GET SOME SEATS HOPING ALL 
THE TIME THEY WERE PREPARED TO GO 
ON A COMPROMISE WITH THE REGIME 
EVEN SETTING THE SCENE FOR CERTAIN 
CANDIDATES THAT EVERYBODY IS 
TALKING ABOUT NOW IN EGYPT WHAT 
THEY CALL INHERITANCE FROM THE SUN 
TO THE FATHER SETTING THE SCENE 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD WOULDN'T 
HAVE RESISTED THIS AND WOULDN'T 
HAVE IN A WAY COMPROMISED SUCH A 
THING IF THEY WERE ALLOWED TO TAKE 
SOME SEATS 
YOU BASICALLY THINK 
THEY'VE COMPROMISE TOO MUCH WITH 
THE GOVERNMENT AND SHOULD HAVE 
CALLED HIS BOYCOTT EARLIER YES YES GENERALLY THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN 
FROM THE BEGINNING IF THEY SEE THE 
ELECTION IS NOT GOING TO BE FAIR 
FROM THEIR SIDE ISSUE HAVE KUYT 
CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT 
VETS TALK 
ABOUT AMERICA'S ROLE IN THIS AS WE 
HEARD CONDOLEEZZA RICE AND 
PRESIDENT BUSH ONLY THREE YEARS AGO 
CALLING FOR MORE DEMOCRACY 
GENERALLY IN THE ARAB WORLD 
PARTICULARLY IN EGYPT HAS IT LOST 
INTEREST IN THAT AGENDA NOW NOT NOT ONLY IN EGYPT BUT FOR THE REST YES 
SOMEHOW THEY HAVE SEEN THE ELECTION 
DATE AND SEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN 
PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES IN HAMAS 
THEY DIDN'T LIKE THAT THEY DIDN'T 
WANT SUCH A CHANGE TO GO ON IN 
OTHER COUNTRIES YEAH THEY STILL 
NEED EGYPT ACTUALLY NOW THE 
REMAINING FEW MONTHS BULL THE 
AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION THEY WANT 
TO DO SOMETHING BETWEEN THE 
PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS AND THE 
EGYPTIANS ARE HELPFUL IN THAT A A RESTAURANT IN GERMANY HAS COME UP 
WITH A HIGH TECH SOLUTION TO THE 
PROBLEM OF BAD SERVICE AND RUDE 
STAFF IT'S GOT RID OF THE WAITERS 
AND CREATED AN ENTIRELY AUTOMATED 
EATERIE CUSTOMERS USE COMPUTERS TO 
ORDER AND ANY FOOD MAKES A DRAMATIC 
APPEARANCE OUR CORRESPONDENT HAS 
BEEN SAMPLING THE NEW SERVICE IN 
NUREMBERG GERMANY HAS GIVEN THE 
WORLD MANY GREAT INVENTIONS THE 
ASPIRIN THE AIRSHIP THE DIESEL 
ENGINE BUT SURELY NOTHING EVER AS 
WEIRD AS THIS FROM NUREMBERG IT'S 
THE AUTOMATED RESTAURANT NO 
WAITERS NO WITNESSES HERE AT THE 
FOOD MAKES ITS OWN WEIGHT TO YOUR 
TABLE AND THE WAY YOU ORDER YOUR 
FOOD IS FULLY AUTOMATED TOO EACH 
SEAT IS NUMBERED AND COLOUR CODED 
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE YOUR NUMBER ON 
THE TOUCH SCREEN T. V. THAT BRINGS UP 
THE MENU SO YOU CAN BROWSE THROUGH 
THE MENU YOU CAN HEAR ALL THE FISH 
DISHES FOR EXAMPLE AND THE MEAT 
DISHES LET'S HAVE A LOOK DOWN HERE 
WHAT'S THIS BEEFSTEAK WITH SALAD 
THAT WILL DO ME YOU ORDER THAT AND 
THEN YOU PUT IN THE CHIP CARD THAT 
KEEPS IT HAVE OF ORDER ORDER YOU 
PAY FOR IT LATER THAT ORDERED THE 
ORDER POPS UP ON A COMPUTER SCREEN 
IN THE KITCHEN FOOD IS FRESHLY 
PREPARED BY THE CHEF THEY HAVEN'T 
FOUND A WAY OF AUTOMATING HIM JUST 
YET THEN IT'S PUT ON THE RAILS AND 
DISPATCHED DOWNHILL MANNA FROM 
HEAVEN GERMAN STYLE 
IT'S A VERY 
EFFICIENT WAY BECAUSE YOU CAN SAVE 
LABOUR COSTS YOU DON'T NEED THE 
WAITERS TO RUN TO THE CUSTOMERS 
TAKE THEIR ORDERS RUN TO THE 
KITCHEN AND BACK TO THE GUESTS AND AND WHO NEEDS CLEANERS WHEN THERE ARE 
ROBOTS TO MARK UP THE GERMANS 
BELIEVE THAT THEIR FAST FOOD WILL 
SPARK A REVOLUTION IN THE 
RESTAURANT BUSINESS MAKING YOUR 
TIME'S NOT ONLY MORE EFFICIENT BUT

BIT STERILE I LIKE A BIT OF HUMAN 
CONTACT IN A RESTAURANT LET'S GET
