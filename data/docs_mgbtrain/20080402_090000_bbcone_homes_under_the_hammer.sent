TWO ON THE FRONT ONE THERE ONE THERE AND TWO ON THE BACK ONE THERE AND ONE THERE 
TWO ON THE FRONT ONE THERE ONE THERE AND TWO ON THE BACK ONE THERE AND ONE THERE 
WELL THE WEATHER IS HOT TODAY 
BUT CAN YOU TELL THE TEMPERATURE OF THE PROPERTY MARKET 
YES SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFICULT TO JUDGE WHETHER IT'S BLOWING HOT OR COLD 
WELL ONE GREAT WAY TO SUSS IT OUT IS TO VISIT YOUR LOCAL AUCTION HOUSE 
WHEN YOU GO TO A PROPERTY AUCTION YOU CAN TELL WHETHER THERE IS 
CONFIDENCE IN THE MARKET OR EVERYONE IS PLAYING A CAUTIOUS GAME 
WELL IT'S A FASCINATING PICTURE OF THE PROPERTY MARKET AS A WHOLE 
HERE ARE THE PROPERTIES THAT WENT TO AUCTION ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME 
EVERY ROOM IN THIS EDWARDIAN HOUSE IN HARROGATE IS WORTH EXPLORING 
LOOK WHAT YOU COME ACROSS THIS FIREPLACE 
ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
THERE IS BOUND TO BE ONE COLOUR YOU'LL LIKE IN THIS THREE BED PROPERTY IN KENT 
BEDROOM TWO TANGERINE ORANGE 
AND THE COLOURS CONTINUE IN STOKE OUTSIDE ITS OVERGROWN GREEN BUT INSIDE 
THESE WALLS AREN'T YELLOW FROM PAINT THEY'RE YELLOW FROM NICOTINE 
ALL THESE PROPERTIES WENT TO AUCTION 
WE'LL FIND OUT WHO BOUGHT THEM AND WHAT THEY PAID FOR THEM WHEN THEY WENT UNDER THE HAMMER 
WELL IT'S NO WONDER THAT HARROGATE IS GENERALLY REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TOWNS IN THE COUNTRY 
HERE I AM JUST A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY AND BEHIND THIS HEDGE 
THERE IS A HOUSE THAT IS UP FOR AUCTION WHICH SOUNDS GREAT 
FOUR BEDROOMS SEMI DETACHED IN NEED OF A BID OF 
TENDER LOVING CARE BUT IT'S GOT A GUIDE PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE LIKE 
COME AND HAVE A LOOK 
FANTASTIC 
BIG EDWARDIAN PROPERTY LARGE GARDEN THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL 
WOW 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU JUST WALK IN SOMEWHERE AND IT HITS YOU THIS IS AN AMAZING HOUSE 
YOU GOT AN ENTRANCE PORCH THERE WHICH LEADS INTO SOMETHING 
YOU JUST DON'T SEE ANY MORE IN MODERN HOUSES THIS BIG ENTRANCE 
WONDERFUL ALL THE ROOMS NATURALLY LEAD OFF IT 
YOU'VE GOT THE STAIRCASE HERE 
GLORIOUS START THE HIGH CEILINGS 
FRONT ROOM BIT OF A HIDEOUS FIREPLACE BUT A BIG BAY FRONTED WINDOW WHICH IS LOVELY 
REAR SITTING ROOM THERE AND THEN THROUGH INTO WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
A FORMAL DINING ROOM IN THE GLORY DAYS 
LOOK WHAT YOU COME ACROSS 
THIS FIREPLACE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL WITH THE OLD TILES IN HERE 
EVEN THE OLD BITS AND PIECES HAVE BEEN LEFT 
GORGEOUS IT GETS BETTER 
THROUGH HERE FRENCH DOORS 
OUT ONTO THE GARDEN IT'S A GREAT START 
THE REMAINDER OF THE DOWNSTAIRS IS LESS INSPIRING 
THE PARLOUR WITH ITS LOG BURNER LEADS TO THE KITCHEN WHICH IS DATED AND UGLY 
THE ONE REDEEMING FEATURE IS THAT AGAIN IT'S REALLY WELL PROPORTIONED A GOOD SIZED ROOM 
OUTSIDE THE GARDEN IS PRETTY OVERGROWN BUT WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL AFTER A BIT OF WEED WHACKING 
THE EXTERIOR BETRAYS THIS PROPERTY 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF SIGNS THAT IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK 
BUT ANY WOULD BE DEVELOPER SHOULD SEE PAST ALL THAT TO THE POSITIVES 
THIS HOUSE HAS SPACE IN ABUNDANCE 
NOW I KNOW IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST EFFICIENT DESIGN BUT I LOVE 
THE FACT THAT THIS HOUSE HAS GOT JUST SO MUCH SPACE 
HERE ON THE FIRST FLOOR AGAIN A HUGE GREAT LANDING 
IT GIVES THAT GREAT FEELING OF NO CLAUSTROPHOBIA WHATSOEVER 
ON TOP OF THAT YOU'VE GOT GOOD SIZED ROOMS FOUR BEDROOMS HERE 
TWO ON THE FRONT ONE THERE ONE THERE AND TWO ON THE BACK ONE THERE AND ONE THERE 
AGAIN GOOD SIZED DOUBLE BEDROOMS THERE'S A BATHROOM 
NOW THAT CLEARLY NEEDS COMPLETE REFURBISHMENT BUT AGAIN REASONABLE SIZE 
HAVING SAID THAT IF YOU DID WANT TO INCREASE 
THE SIZE OF THE HOUSE MAYBE YOU COULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING A STAIRCASE IN THERE 
SOME OF THE OTHER PROPERTIES IN THE ROAD HAVE PUT A DORMER WINDOW IN 
SO MAYBE TAKE IT UP ONE MORE FLOOR PUT A BEDROOM UP THERE 
AND INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE HOUSE EVEN MORE 
I DON'T REALLY THINK YOU NEED TO DO THAT BUT YOU COULD IF YOU WANTED TO 
THE LOCAL AREA HAS ALL THE AMENITIES YOU COULD NEED 
A TRAIN STATION FOR COMMUTING 
A POST OFFICE GENERAL STORE AND THE ALWAYS ESSENTIAL PUB 
BUT IS THIS A PLACE THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO LIVE 
WOULD INVESTING IN THIS PROPERTY BE FINANCIALLY VIABLE 
I ASKED A LOCAL AGENT HIS OPINION 
THE PROPERTY IS ACTUALLY SITUATED ON A FAIRLY BUSY MAIN ROAD 
THERE IS PRIVATE ACCESS TO THE REAR WHICH IS 
MAINTAINED BY THE RESIDENTS AND DOES NEED WORK DOING TO IT 
THERE IS SCOPE WITH THE PROPERTY TO TAKE PART OF THE GARDEN AWAY 
AND CREATE PARKING FOR THREE OR FOUR CARS WHICH WOULD BE IDEAL 
PRIVATE REAR PARKING MEANS YOU'D ALWAYS BE ABLE TO PARK RIGHT OUTSIDE 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE ITSELF 
THE HOUSE ITSELF COULD BE FANTASTIC 
IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK DOING TO IT AND IT'S QUITE A MAJOR UNDERTAKING BUT THE STRUCTURE LOOKS FAIRLY SOUND 
THAT AMOUNT OF WORK WOULD COST A LOT OF MONEY 
I WONDER HOW DEEP THE BUYER'S POCKETS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE 
IT WAS BUILT AROUND NINETEEN TEN 
DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY BEEN TOUCHED SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
TO DO A LOFT CONVERSION AND PUT THE PROPERTY INTO A GOOD STATE OF REPAIR 
YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE THICK END OF SIXTY THOUSAND 
SO WITH A GUIDE PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WHAT COULD THIS PROPERTY BE WORTH 
IT DEPENDS ON THE STANDARD IT'S DONE TO AND HOW MUCH THE ACCOMMODATION IS MODIFIED 
IF YOU DO A LOFT CONVERSION AND CREATE A FIVE OR SIX BEDROOM SEMI 
YOU COULD BE TALKING INTO THE MID THREE HUNDREDS 
THAT'S FANTASTIC 
THIS HOUSE DESERVES SOME ATTENTION AND THAT NEWS SHOULD MAKE THE LUCKY BIDDER AT THE AUCTION VERY HAPPY 
YOU KNOW IT'S SO EASY TO BE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
A BIT OF TENDER LOVING CARE AND YOU COULD TURN THIS PLACE 
BACK INTO THE BEAUTIFUL HOME THAT IT ONCE WAS AND COULD EASILY BE AGAIN 
LET'S SEE HOW THE AUCTION WENT 
LOT NUMBER THREE TODAY FIFTEEN HIGH STREET STARBECK 
WHAT'S THIS ONE WORTH TWO HUNDRED 
TWO HUNDRED BID TWO HUNDRED FIVE TWO HUNDRED TEN ON MY EXTREME LEFT 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN NEW BIDDERS 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIRTY THIRTY FIVE FORTY FORTY FIVE 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THANK YOU SIR 
TWO HUNDRED SIXTY LADY'S BID SIXTY FIVE WOULD BE A VERY ASTUTE BID RIGHT NOW SIR 
TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE IS BID TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE IS BID FOUR FIVE TWO EIGHTY SIX TWO EIGHTY SEVEN 
TWO HUNDRED NINETY MIGHT PUT THEM OFF THE SCENT 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE WILL YOU MAKE IT NINETY SIR 
TWO HUNDRED NINETY TWO HUNDRED NINETY IS AGAINST YOU 
NINETY ONE NINETY ONE 
NINETY ONE NINETY TWO I KNOW IT'S BREATHTAKING ISN'T IT 
NINETY ONE NINETY TWO JUST IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR ME AT TWO 
TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE 
NINETY TWO WILL YOU 
AT NINETY TWO IT IS NINETY TWO IS BID NINETY THREE NINETY FOUR 
NINETY THREE AND A HALF HE SAYS NINETY THREE AND A HALF 
NINETY FOUR SIR NINETY FOUR A N. D. A HALF 
TWO HUNDRED NINETY FOUR AND A HALF HE SAYS 
TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE WILL YOU 
AT TWO HUNDRED NINETY FOUR AND A HALF IT'S GOING THEN AT TWO HUNDRED NINETY FOUR AND A HALF ARE YOU SURE 
TWO HUNDRED NINETY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FOR THE FIRST TIME 
TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE SIR 
TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME 
AT TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND SECOND AND LAST TIME 
ARE WE ABSOLUTELY SURE 
PROPERTY SOLD GENTLEMAN STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME AND THE PRICE IS TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND IS A LONG WAY OVER THE ASKING PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED 
BUT THE WINNING BIDDER SHOULD KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING 
HE'S A PROPERTY SURVEYOR AND WHEN HE WAS SIXTEEN HIS FIRST JOB WAS WITH AN ESTATE AGENT 
LINDSAY CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
PAID A LITTLE BIT OVER THE GUIDE PRICE BUT GOT A FANTASTIC HOUSE YEAH I THINK IT'S A GOOD BUY 
AND THE GUIDE PRICE WAS TWO HUNDRED BUT I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT LOW 
I'M VERY PLEASED VERY PLEASED WHY DID YOU WANT TO BUY IT 
I THINK BECAUSE WHEN I VIEWED THE PROPERTY IT WAS SUCH A MASSIVE PROJECT IT'S LIKE A BIT OF A TARDIS 
OUTSIDE IT DOES NOT LOOK BIG INSIDE IT'S HUGE 
YOU'VE GOT GREAT RECEPTION ROOMS FLOOR TO CEILING HEIGHTS ARE GREAT AND IT'S GOT A NICE FEEL 
IT'S GOT A GARDEN AND POTENTIAL FOR PLENTY OF PARKING EXTENDING SO SUPERB 
WHEN I WALKED IN IN THIS AREA WHERE WE ARE NOW 
I THOUGHT YOU DON'T GET THIS KIND OF SPACE IN HOUSES ANY MORE 
IN THE NEW HOUSES THAT ARE BEING BUILT YOU GET TINY CORRIDORS 
AND ALL THE REST OF IT WHICH IS NOT WHAT I'M INTO REALLY 
YOU CAN'T BEAT PERIOD FEATURES LIKE HIGH CEILINGS 
THERE'S SO MUCH CHARACTER IT'S A GEM WHY HAS LINDSAY BOUGHT IT 
THE MAIN REASON IS TO LIVE IN IT MYSELF 
THINGS MAY CHANGE AND THEY MAY RENTED OUT OR MAY SELL IT 
BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S TO LIVE IN IT 
SO THAT PERSONAL SIDE OF IT CAME IN YEAH THE PERSONAL SIDE IS IN BECAUSE I THINK WITH 
THE BIG ROOMS AND YOU CAN PUT YOUR OWN STAMP ON IT WITH IT NEEDING FAIRLY MUCH REFURBISHED 
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CHALLENGE 
THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO PART OF THIS HOUSE THAT DOESN'T NEED SOME TENDER 
LOVING CARE BUT LINDSAY SEEMS HAPPY TO POUR HIS HEART AND SOUL INTO IT 
WHAT ABOUT THE AREA IT'S IN 
HARROGATE'S IN THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE YOU'VE GOT LEEDS HARROGATE AND YORK 
HARROGATE FITS PART OF THAT THE COMMUTER BELT FOR LEEDS 
YOU CAN GET A HOUSE LIKE THIS FOR UNDER THREE HUNDRED GRAND YES 
I MEAN AT THE SAME SORT OF HOUSE IN THE CENTRE OF HARROGATE WHICH YOU WOULD BE LOOKING AT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WOW THAT'S A MILE AND A HALF DOWN THE ROAD 
YEAH I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S MORE THAN I'VE PAID NOW FROM TODAY 
YOU CAN'T GET THE SIZE OF ACCOMMODATION IN HARROGATE 
OR THE SURROUNDING AREAS FOR THE SIZE OF PROPERTY 
IT'S WORTH MORE NOW WHEN I'VE DONE IT UP HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE WORTH A LOT MORE 
WELL THAT'S WHAT I'M PLANNING ON LINDSAY HASN'T BEEN HANGING ABOUT 
HE'S HAD PRELIMINARY PLANS DRAWN UP AND HOPES TO COMPLETE ALL THE WORK WITHIN FOUR MONTHS 
THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND ESPECIALLY THE KITCHEN HAVE THE MOST SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT 
THIS IS A ROOM YOU CAN DO SOME BIG THINGS WITH 
YET IT'S A SUPER ROOM THE SIZE OF IT AND IT'S GOT LOTS OF LIGHT WE WANT TO CREATE SOME MORE LIGHT 
WE'VE WORKED WITH THE ARCHITECT TO GET INITIAL CONCEPTS 
SO WE'VE GOT SOME PLANS HERE WHICH SHOW WHERE ARE WE NOW 
WE ARE HERE BY THE ENTRANCE DOOR BEHIND ME 
TO THE RIGHT ON THE SIDE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT TAKING THE WALL OUT COMPLETELY AND POSSIBLY EXTEND 
THE DINING ROOM TO BE LEVEL WITH THE KITCHEN WALL SO THAT WOULD GIVE US MORE ACCOMMODATION 
IT'S A GREAT IDEA BUT WE NEED TO WORK AT IT IN PRACTICE WHETHER 
IT'S GOING TO BE PRACTICAL 
WELL THEY ARE VERY DETAILED PLANS 
LINDSAY'S EVEN TALKING ABOUT A LOFT CONVERSION 
HE PAID A HIGH PRICE AT AUCTION AND DOES NOT SEEM WORRIED ABOUT 
BLOWING THE BUDGET WHICH IS JUST WHAT THE HOUSE DESERVES 
WELL LINDSAY DOES HAVE GRAND PLANS FOR THIS GRAND OLD HOUSE 
HE CERTAINLY SEEMS TO HAVE THOUGHT IT THROUGH 
BUT HOW'S HE GOING TO GET ON DOING ALL THAT IN FOUR MONTHS 
YOU CAN FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW 
WELCOME TO HISTORIC ROCHESTER IN KENT 
CHARLES DICKENS LOVED THE TOWN SPENDING LARGE PARTS OF HIS LIFE HERE 
AND HIS WORK IS FULL OF LOCAL REFERENCES 
SO ENCHANTED WAS DICKENS WITH THIS CORNER OF KENT THAT HE REQUESTED TO BE BURIED WITHIN THE CASTLE GROUNDS 
BUT THE AUTHORITIES INTERVENED AND HE WAS INSTEAD LAID TO REST AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY 
YOU CAN SEE WHY HE HAD SUCH AN ATTACHMENT TO THE PLACE IT IS CHARMING 
LET'S SEE IF THE PROPERTY UP FOR AUCTION TODAY IS AS CAPTIVATING AS THE TOWN IN WHICH IT SITS 
WELL THE PROPERTY WE ARE HERE TO SEE ISN'T A CASTLE BUT IT'S JUST 
ONE STOP AWAY BY TRAIN OR YOU CAN WALK 
THIS IS WOODSTOCK ROAD IN STROOD 
NOW IT'S JUST A FIFTEEN MINUTE WALK FROM THE HISTORIC HEART OF ROCHESTER 
THE PROPERTY UP FOR AUCTION TODAY IS HERE 
IT'S A THREE BEDROOM END OF TERRACE AND IT'S ALL FOR A GUIDE PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
PERHAPS THE FIRST THING TO NOTE IS THE SLOPE DOWN TO THE PROPERTY 
IT'S PRETTY STEEP MAKING OFF ROAD PARKING DIFFICULT 
THERE'S A SMALL GARAGE AND I MEAN SMALL 
I'M NOT SURE YOU'D GET A MODERN CAR IN HERE BUT 
THERE'S A DECENT GARDEN OUT BACK WHICH IS AGAIN FAR FROM FLAT 
WELL THAT IS QUITE A STEEP DRIVEWAY 
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT LEVELLED OFF 
NOW THIS IS A REALLY GOOD SIZED RECEPTION ROOM 
THERE'S A RADIATOR DOWN HERE ALTHOUGH IT IS A BIT SMALL 
BUT THERE IS CENTRAL HEATING IN HERE SO THAT'S A BONUS 
BUT THIS OVER HERE IS A BIT OF A DESIGN DISASTER 
A WALL CLAD IN STONE NOT REALLY TO MY TASTE 
I THINK A BIT OF BOXING IN WOULD BE AN EASY JOB HERE 
TO TAKE ALL THIS OFF WOULD BE VERY TIME CONSUMING 
THERE'S ALSO ARTEX CEILINGS YOU'VE GOT WOODCHIP WALLPAPER EVERYWHERE SO THIS ROOM CAN ONLY IMPROVE 
YOU KNOW WHAT I QUITE LIKE ROOMS LIKE THIS 
NOT FOR THE WAY THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT 
BUT BECAUSE THEY CAN BE TRANSFORMED WITH ELBOW GREASE AND A LICK OF PAINT 
IT CAN BE REALLY REWARDING 
THE KITCHEN IS AT THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY AS YOU CAN SEE IT LEADS OFF THE LOUNGE AND IT'S TIRED 
IT DEFINITELY NEEDS A BIT OF A LIFT IN HERE 
IT'S GOT STRIP LIGHTING THERE'S OLD LINO ON THE FLOOR BUT 
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH OF YOUR CASH YOU COULD THINK ABOUT REPLACING JUST THE DOORS HERE 
BECAUSE THE CARCASSES ARE ACTUALLY QUITE SOLID UNDERNEATH 
NOW I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT LEADS OFF THE KITCHEN 
LET'S HAVE A LITTLE LOOK 
NOT THE UTILITY NOT EVEN A DOOR LEADING TO THE GARDEN 
BUT A DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM NOW THAT IS REALLY DISAPPOINTING 
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE THAT FROM A HOUSE OF THIS SIZE 
LET'S JUST HOPE YOU CAN RELOCATE THAT UPSTAIRS 
IF THE BATHROOM COULD BE REMOVED THIS AREA WOULD MAKE 
A GREAT UTILITY SPACE OR REALLY INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE KITCHEN 
BUT IS THERE ANYWHERE UPSTAIRS TO MOVE THE BATHROOM TO 
BEDROOM ONE TURQUOISE 
BEDROOM TWO TANGERINE ORANGE 
AND BEDROOM THREE GETS ITS OWN SOLID DOOR AND A LICK OF LILAC PAINT 
NOW COMEDY COLOURS ASIDE I'M LOOKING TO RE HOUSE THAT DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 
IT WOULD MEAN LOSING A BEDROOM UP HERE BUT I'VE BEEN CHATTING TO SOME LOCAL AGENTS 
AND I DON'T THINK IT WOULD DAMAGE THE VALUE OF THIS PROPERTY TAKING IT DOWN TO A TWO BEDROOM HOUSE 
IN FACT I THINK IT WOULD MAKE IT MORE SALEABLE 
I'M A RAINBOW TOO 
I'M A RAINBOW TOO 
I'M A RAINBOW TOO 
I'M A RAINBOW TOO 
IF I WAS TO CONVERT ONE OF THE BEDROOMS TO A BATHROOM I THINK OUT OF THE THREE BEDROOMS 
IT'S THE TURQUOISE ONE I'D LOSE 
LEAVING THE OTHER TWO GOOD SIZED BEDROOMS 
BUT WHAT DOES A LOCAL ESTATE AGENT THINK OF LOSING A BEDROOM 
I THINK IF YOU CHANGED THIS FROM A THREE BEDROOM INTO A TWO 
YOU'D HAVE TWO LARGER BEDROOMS 
WHICH IS BETTER THAN HAVING THREE 
I DON'T THINK IT'D DECREASE THE VALUE 
THIS HOUSE WAS GUIDED AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
DOES IT HAVE MUCH POTENTIAL FOR FINANCIAL GROWTH 
THE PRICE THIS IS LIKELY TO GO ON THE MARKET FOR IN VERY GOOD CONDITION 
IS LIKELY TO BE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
BASED ON OTHER PROPERTIES AROUND THE AREA 
THE RENTAL PER CALENDAR MONTH IS PROBABLY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED A MONTH 
WITH SO MUCH INVESTMENT BEING POURED INTO THIS AREA IT WOULD SEEM A WISE AUCTION PROPERTY TO TAKE A PUNT ON 
LET'S SEE WHO WENT FOR IT AS WE HEAD TO AUCTION 
SEVENTY NINE IS FIFTY EIGHT WOODSTOCK ROAD IN ROCHESTER 
ONE HUNDRED TEN I'M LOOKING FOR ONE HUNDRED I'LL TAKE 
ONE HUNDRED I HAVE I'M ON THE WAY AT ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE NOW I'M LOOKING FOR 
ONE HUNDRED FIVE CAN I SAY 
ONE HUNDRED FIVE ONE HUNDRED TEN ONE HUNDRED TEN AND FIFTEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
AND TWO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY I HAVE TWO I'M LOOKING FOR 
ANYBODY ELSE COMING IN 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND BID I'VE GOT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THANK YOU AND FOUR 
SIX I HAVE AND EIGHT 
THIRTEEN I THOUGHT IT WAS WITH YOU AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT 
NO IT'S WITH YOU ISN'T IT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY YOU'RE SITTING BEHIND EACH OTHER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY 
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO CONFUSE ME ONE HUNDRED THIRTY AND TWO 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
THIRTY NINE COME ON ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE ANYWHERE 
ARE WE ALL DONE AT ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
IT'S AGAINST YOU IN THE BLACK T. SHIRT SIR BEHIND YOU YOU'RE SITTING IN LINE ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
ONE ANYWHERE ELSE ARE YOU COMING BACK IN AGAIN 
IF NOT AT ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND I WILL SELL FOR THE FIRST TIME 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND BID I'M SELLING FOR THE SECOND TIME 
THIRD AND FINAL TIME IF YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE ALL DONE AT ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
IT'S YOURS AT ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND AND THAT'S FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY TWO THANK YOU 
FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND THE NEW OWNERS ARE FRIENDS ALAN AND JASON 
ALAN IS AN AUTO ELECTRICIAN WHO FITS ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS IN CARS 
AND JASON IS A DIRECTOR OF A CAR ACCIDENT REPAIR COMPANY 
SO WHAT DROVE THEM TO BUY A THREE BED TERRACE IN STROOD 
WE'D SEEN THE PROPERTY BRIEFLY AND LOOKED ROUND THE OUTSIDE AND DONE A FEW CALCULATIONS 
SAW WHAT WE THOUGHT WE'D GET IT FOR AND WHAT IT WOULD GO FOR 
AND WE BOUGHT IT AT THE PRICE THAT WAS OUR TOP PRICE REALLY 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND WHEN THE HAMMER WENT DOWN WHAT THEN RELIEF 
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING 
NO THAT'S TRUE 
WE ONLY WENT THERE TO LOOK ANYWAY WE DIDN'T GO THERE TO BUY 
AND YOU SPENT ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND NOT GOOD 
IT'S A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT YEAH DEFINITELY 
BUYING A PROPERTY WITH SOMEONE ELSE OBVIOUSLY HALVES THE FINANCIAL COMMITMENT 
HOWEVER IT CAN DOUBLE THE HASSLE PARTICULARLY IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER WELL ENOUGH 
SO ARE ALAN AND JASON CONFIDENT ABOUT WORKING TOGETHER 
WHAT'S THE HISTORY WITH YOU TWO HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN EACH OTHER 
AROUND FIFTEEN YEARS NOW 
JASON WAS MY BEST MAN AT MY WEDDING 
I THINK OVER THE YEARS OUR WIVES ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS 
AND THROUGH THAT WE'VE SORT OF GELLED TOGETHER AS WELL 
COME ON COME ON 
LET'S WORK TOGETHER 
OH 
THESE TWO ARE OBVIOUSLY GOOD MATES 
LET'S HOPE THEY HAVE THE SAME AIMS FOR THEIR FIRST DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY 
OH COME ON LET'S WORK TOGETHER NOW 
SO NOW YOU'VE GOT THE HOUSE 
YEAH HOW DO YOU FEEL AND WHAT PLANS HAVE YOU GOT 
I THINK MAYBE JUST A BIT OF GROUTING ROUND HERE AND A LICK OF PAINT 
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK IN HERE YOUR HEART KIND OF GOES URGH 
YOU'VE GOT STIPPLED CEILINGS WOODCHIP WALLPAPER AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS MONSTROSITY 
FANTASTIC THIS MAY COME BACK INTO FASHION 
IT'S OUT OF CORONATION STREET ALL YOU NEED IS THE DUCKS GOING ACROSS ABSOLUTELY YEAH 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M LOOKING AT THE WALLS AND THEY'RE NOT TOO BAD 
IT'S WOODCHIP INNIT THAT'S GONNA COME OFF 
I MIGHT HAVE TO LINE THE WALLS ALAN YOU'RE SAYING I MIGHT HAVE TO LINE THE WALLS 
ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO DO THE WORK OH YEAH 
I MEAN I WAS A DECORATOR FOR FIFTEEN YEARS 
HE'S A GOOD DECORATOR AS WELL I'M A GOOD DECORATOR 
SO I'VE GOT NO TROUBLES WITH DECORATING AT ALL 
HAVE YOU STILL GOT ANY OF YOUR OLD DECORATING PAINTBRUSHES AND OVERALLS YES HAVE YOU YES 
NO I STILL HAVE MY OVERALLS 
SO WILL YOU BE BLOWING THE COBWEBS OFF NOT HALF DUSTING THEM DOWN 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
ARE THEY STILL GONNA FIT YOU THEY MIGHT BE A BIT TIGHT ROUND THE WAIST 
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU IN THEM CAN'T WAIT 
SO ALAN WILL BE ROLLING BACK THE YEARS AS HE RETURNS 
TO ONE OF HIS FORMER PROFESSIONS BUT WHAT WILL JASON BE DOING 
HOLDING BACK THE YEARS 
JASON ARE YOU GOING TO BE IN HERE WITH THE STEAMER HELPING OUT 
YEAH DEFINITELY PUT THE KITCHEN IN 
I'VE JUST DONE DONE MY OWN PROPERTY 
RENOVATED THAT PUT NEW KITCHENS BATHROOMS 
IF YOU'D SEEN HOW HE'S DONE HIS PROPERTY IT'S LOVELY HOW DO YOU RATE HIS WORKMANSHIP 
IT'S GOOD YEAH HE'S A PERFECTIONIST SOMETIMES TOO PERFECTIONIST 
I'M TOO FUSSY YEAH 
ON THE FACE OF IT THESE TWO MAKE A GREAT TEAM 
I'M SURE ALAN'S DECORATING SKILLS WILL BE FULLY EMPLOYED 
BUT NEITHER OF THEM HAVE ANY ACTUAL BUILDING EXPERIENCE 
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO TACKLE ANYTHING STRUCTURAL IN HERE 
NO NO SO YOU'RE GONNA KEEP THE BATHROOM DOWNSTAIRS 
I THINK SO YEAH SEE I'VE HAD A CHAT WITH A COUPLE OF ESTATE AGENTS LOCALLY 
AND THEY THINK IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T DAMAGE THE VALUE OF THIS PROPERTY 
BY MOVING THAT BATHROOM UPSTAIRS AND FREEING UP A SPACE DOWN THERE 
EITHER YOU COULD USE THAT AS A BEDROOM OR AN OFFICE SPACE 
IF IT WAS GONNA BE FINANCIALLY VIABLE TO DO THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER IT 
DEPENDS WHAT THE GAIN'S GONNA BE AND OBVIOUSLY THE COST TO MOVE IT 
HOW ARE YOUR PLUMBING SKILLS 
THEY'RE NOT TOO BAD YEAH O. K. 
YOU'RE QUITE CONFIDENT THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU TWO NOTHING IS FAZING YOU 
NO I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT WE WON'T DO IS ANY PLASTERING LIKE SMOOTHING THESE LOVELY CEILINGS 
WE'LL GET SOMEONE IN BUT I THINK EVERYTHING ELSE WE'LL DO OURSELVES 
BETWEEN THEM THEY'VE GOT A NUMBER OF CONTACTS IN THE BUILDING TRADE 
THEY CAN CALL ON FOR THE JOBS THEY CAN'T TACKLE SO THEY DO SEEM PRETTY SORTED 
SO THIS IS THE BIG QUESTION 
WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET SIX THOUSAND 
AND HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE YOU TO SPEND THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THIS PROPERTY 
PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR TO SIX WEEKS I THINK WE'LL TURN THIS ROUND O. K. 
SO YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT YOURSELVES 
ARE YOU GOING TO QUIT YOUR JOBS OR TRY AND COME IN HERE WEEKENDS AFTER WORK 
NO THIS IS FULL TIME IT'S FULL TIME ABSOLUTELY FULL TIME THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT 
IF WE MUCK AROUND AT WEEKENDS THEN IT'S TOUGH 
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT ALAN ONE HUNDRED PER CENT COMMITMENT 
YOU CAN GET IT IF YOU REALLY WANT 
BUT YOU MUST TRY 
TRY AND TRY 
TRY AND TRY 
YOU'LL SUCCEED AT LAST 
THEY'RE RIGHT TIME IS MONEY AND THE BEST ROUTE TO A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT 
IS TO GET IN TURN IT AROUND 
AND GET IT BACK ON THE MARKET AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
THIS HOUSE MAY BE A CRASH COURSE FOR THEM BUT AS WITH MANY THINGS 
I'M SURE THEY'LL GET THERE IF THEY REALLY WANT TO 
JASON AND ALAN HAVE COME A LONG WAY SINCE CAR AUCTIONS 
BORED BY THE GRIND OF THEIR DAILY JOB THEY HAVE LIKE SO MANY OTHERS BEFORE THEM 
DECIDED TO DIP THEIR TOE INTO PROPERTY DEVELOPING 
THIS MAY BE SOMETHING THEY DO FULL TIME BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW THIS ONE GOES 
WITH THEIR LIST OF CONTACTS I'M IMAGINING THEY'LL DO WELL 
BUT SIX GRAND IN SIX WEEKS 
I'M NOT SO SURE 
JOIN ME LATER IN THE PROGRAMME TO SEE HOW THINGS PAN OUT FOR THE PAIR 
COMING UP WHEN YOU SEE THE BATHROOM IT'S NO WONDER THIS STOKE PROPERTY IS TRYING TO HIDE AWAY 
IS THAT BATHROOM SUITE EVER GONNA COME BACK IN FASHION I DON'T THINK SO 
BACK IN KENT WHERE HAVE THE BOYS BEEN TOASTING THE REFURBISHMENT OF THIS PLACE 
WE HAVEN'T REALLY GONE FOR A PINT WE WENT DOWN THE CAF 
WE GO DOWN FOR A TREAT EVERY FRIDAY 
BUT FIRST HAS THE RENOVATION OF THIS EDWARDIAN HOUSE GONE TO PLAN 
WE MIGHT TAKE THAT WALL OUT COMPLETELY TO DO AN L. SHAPED KITCHEN DINER 
THE LAST TIME WE WERE IN STARBECK A MILE AND A HALF OUT OF HARROGATE TOWN CENTRE 
LINDSAY HAD PAID TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND FOR THIS FOUR BEDROOMED EDWARDIAN PROPERTY 
THIS CHARTERED SURVEYOR HAD SET HIMSELF A GENEROUS SIXTY THOUSAND BUDGET 
TO RESTORE IT AND PERHAPS BUILD AN EXTENSION 
SIX MONTHS LATER WE'VE COME BACK 
FROM THE OUTSIDE IT LOOKS LIKE NEW WINDOWS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED 
THE HOUSE HAS BEEN PAINTED AND GRAVEL HAS BEEN PUT IN THE GARDEN 
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF ANY EXTENSION WORK 
WE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED TO PUT A GARAGE UP AND AN EXTENSION AND A ROOF CONVERSION 
WHICH WE'VE DECIDED NOT TO DO ONE BECAUSE OF THE MARKET 
AND TWO BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD ADD TOO MUCH VALUE ONTO THE PROPERTY 
WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE A FULL REWIRE FULL RE PLUMB RE SKIMMED EVERYTHING 
PUT NEW FLOORBOARDS IN AND PUT NEW FLOORING 
AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF WORK DONE ON THE ACTUAL DECORATION SIDE 
WE'VE GONE FOR TOP QUALITY FITTINGS WHICH I THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT IN A HOUSE OF THIS SIZE 
THAT APPROACH IS ESPECIALLY EVIDENT IN WHAT WAS A SEPARATE DINING ROOM AND KITCHEN 
AND HAS NOW BEEN MADE INTO A FANTASTIC KITCHEN DINER 
WHAT WE'VE MANAGED TO DO WE'VE TAKEN THE WALL DOWN 
WHICH WAS A SOLID WALL BUT NOT LOAD BEARING FROM THE KITCHEN TO THE DINING ROOM 
WE'VE TAKEN THAT OUT COMPLETELY TO PROVIDE THIS FANTASTIC OPEN PLAN KITCHEN DINER 
THERE WAS AN EXTERNAL DOOR HERE 
WHAT WE'VE MANAGED TO DO IS BLOCK THAT UP TO WINDOWSILL LEVEL 
WE'VE INSERTED A WINDOW TO CREATE LOTS OF NATURAL LIGHT BY THE BREAKFAST BAR 
THEN WE'VE PUT A FANTASTIC RANGE IN WHICH IS A RANGE AND A HALF WITH EXTRACTOR 
OBVIOUSLY WITH AN EXTERNAL WALL 
WE'VE PUT A FRIDGE FREEZER IN WITH GRANITE WORKTOPS 
IT'S SUPERB AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE ROOMS IN THE HOUSE 
THERE'S NO DOUBTING THAT A FAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT HERE 
THIS IS A PRETTY HIGH SPEC KITCHEN 
THAT CONTINUES UPSTAIRS WITH THE INSTALLATION OF A NEW UP TO DATE BATHROOM SUITE 
AND THE FOUR BEDROOMS HAVE BEEN DECORATED TO AN IMPRESSIVE STANDARD 
ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN GRANTED PLANNING PERMISSION 
LINDSAY DECIDED AGAINST CONVERTING THE LOFT INTO A FIFTH BEDROOM 
BUT HE HAS SENSIBLY RUN THE NECESSARY PIPES UP SO CONVERSION COULD BE DONE AT A LATER DATE 
IN TERMS OF THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT MY GIRLFRIEND DID MOST OF THAT WORK 
KEPT AN EYE ON THE BUILDERS MADE SURE EVERYBODY TURNED UP ON TIME 
AND THAT THE TRADES INTERACTED WITH EACH OTHER 
I'VE DONE A LOT OF THE CHOOSING OF MATERIALS DECOR 
AND DISCUSSING THAT OBVIOUSLY WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM I THINK IT'S WORKED VERY WELL 
INTERNALLY HE'S USED THE SPACE CLEVERLY 
HE'S INSTALLED A CLOAKROOM UNDER THE STAIRS ALL IN KEEPING WITH THE PROPERTY 
BUT PERHAPS THE SAME CAN'T BE SAID FOR HIS APPROACH TO THE OUTSIDE 
WHERE HAVE ALL THE FLOWERS GONE 
LONG TIME PASSING 
WHERE HAVE ALL THE FLOWERS GONE 
WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE A LARGE PARKING AREA FOR FOUR CARS AT THE REAR 
THAT WAS A DIFFICULT CHOICE BECAUSE IT WAS A MATTER OF THE GARDEN VERSUS THE CAR PARKING 
WE DECIDED TO GO FIFTY TO FIFTY PEOPLE WILL STILL GET 
A VERY GOOD SIZED GARDEN AND ALSO THEY CAN PARK FOUR CARS OFF THE ROAD 
HOPEFULLY LINDSAY WILL ADD A PLANT OR TWO TO ADD A BIT OF COLOUR 
AS ALL THE WORK IN THE HOUSE WAS DONE BY TRADESMEN LINDSAY'S BILL MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE HIGH 
MY ORIGINAL BUDGET WAS AROUND ABOUT SIXTY TO SEVENTY THOUSAND 
I THINK WE'VE EXCEEDED THAT SLIGHTLY 
WE'RE STILL DOING THE FIGURES ON THAT SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL 
WHETHER WE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER OR ABOUT FIVE TEN PERCENT 
THAT'S A SIZABLE BUDGET WHETHER SIXTY SEVENTY OR EVEN EIGHTY THOUSAND 
HE BOUGHT THE HOUSE FOR TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND SO HE'S LOOKING AT A CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT 
YEAH WE WERE GONNA LIVE IN IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY OTHER INFLUENCES DECIDED 
THEY WANTED TO STOP WHERE WE WERE AND SO WE'VE TAKEN THE DECISION TO ACTUALLY RENT IT OUT NOW 
WE'VE ENGAGED THE SERVICES OF A LOCAL ESTATE AGENT 
AND LETTING AGENT AND WE'RE HOPING TO GET TWO THOUSAND A MONTH FOR IT 
THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE QUITE A HIGH RENTAL RETURN 
BUT THEN LINDSAY WAS AN ESTATE AGENT SO HE SHOULD HAVE SOME IDEA 
BUT HAS HE LOST TOUCH WITH THE CURRENT MARKET OR HAS HE STILL GOT HIS FINGER ON THE PULSE 
WHAT DO TWO LOCAL AGENTS THINK 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY DONE QUITE A NICE JOB WITH THE PROPERTY 
THEY'VE TRANSFORMED THE KITCHEN AND BATHROOM 
NICELY PLASTERED ALL THE WALLS DECORATED THROUGHOUT AND GENERALLY MADE A GOOD BRIGHT LIVING SPACE 
I THINK THE KITCHEN IS LOVELY THE BLACK GRANITE TOPS REALLY SET THE KITCHEN OFF 
VERY STANDARD SHAKER STYLE KITCHEN IT WORKS VERY WELL 
IF YOU COULD PICK THIS PROPERTY UP AND MOVE IT UP THE ROAD 
POTENTIALLY YOU COULD ADD ANOTHER FIFTY TO SIXTY THOUSAND ONTO THE PRICE 
BUT YOU ARE REALLY CONTROLLED BY THE FACT THAT IT'S ON A MAIN ROAD 
OPPOSITE A PETROL STATION AND THERE IS GOING TO BE A LIMIT TO THE VALUE 
SO FAR LINDSAY HAS SPENT AROUND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND ON THE HOUSE 
SO WHAT ARE THE AGENTS' VALUATIONS FOR IT NOW 
IF I WERE TO BUT THIS PROPERTY UP FOR SALE I FEEL IT WOULD ACHIEVE A FIGURE IN THE REGION OF THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND 
I THINK THE PROPERTY WOULD ACHIEVE SOMETHING IN THE REGION OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
PERSONALLY I THINK THAT'S VERY LOW BUT I WOULD BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH A LOT MORE THAN THAT 
IN THE SHORT TERM LINDSAY IS NOW LOOKING TO RENT 
HE'S GOT A FIGURE OF TWO THOUSAND A MONTH IN MIND IS THAT REALISTIC 
IF WE WERE TO PUT THIS PROPERTY UP FOR RENTAL I FEEL WE'D ACHIEVE 
A FIGURE IN THE REGION OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED PER CALENDAR MONTH 
I THINK THE RENTAL PER CALENDAR MONTH WOULD BE IN THE REGION OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
BOTH AGENTS THEN ARE A LITTLE OFF THAT TWO THOUSAND A MONTH LINDSAY WAS HOPING FOR 
SO WHAT DOES HE MAKE OF THOSE FIGURES 
THAT'S ON THE LOW SIDE BUT TIME WILL TELL 
I THINK AS SOON AS PEOPLE COME THROUGH THE DOOR WE'LL ACHIEVE VERY CLOSE TO WHAT WE'RE ASKING 
YOU CAN'T FAULT LINDSAY FOR HIS POSITIVE OUTLOOK 
HE'S UNDOUBTEDLY DONE A GOOD JOB HERE 
BUT PERHAPS HE'S BEING OVER OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE POTENTIAL 
I'M NOT WANTING TO SELL IT AT THIS POINT IN TIME IT'S AN INVESTMENT PROPERTY 
SO I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO WAIT AND RIDE OUT THE STORM 
RIDERS ON THE STORM 
LINDSAY HAS CREATED A CONTEMPORARY HOUSE OUT OF THIS EDWARDIAN VILLA 
LET'S HOPE WHEN THE STORM SUBSIDES AND THE SUN COMES OUT 
THE GARDEN WILL START TO GROW BACK 
I'M IN WOLSTANTON PART OF NEWCASTLE UNDER LYME 
FROM HERE YOU GET A GREAT VIEW OF TWO OF THE NEIGHBOURING POTTERY TOWNS OF BURSLEM AND TUNSTALL 
I'M HERE TO SEE A NINETEEN THIRTIES SEMI 
THIS IS IT BEHIND THE HEDGE 
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE OUTSIDE IT'S GONE TO SEED 
I RECKON WE'RE TALKING STRIMMERS SAWS AND SKIPS FOR THIS PLACE AND THAT'S JUST THE FRONT GARDEN 
JUDGING FROM THE EXTERIOR IT DOESN'T BODE WELL FOR THE HOUSE 
THE RENDERING'S FALLING OFF AS IS THE GUTTERING 
THE WINDOWS ARE ALSO IN A BAD STATE JUST LIKE THE DOOR 
OH DEAR 
NOT A VERY GOOD START IS IT IT'S ONLY A STICKING DOOR 
BUT IT DOESN'T CREATE A VERY GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION 
APART FROM THAT NINETEEN THIRTIES HOUSES I GENERALLY THINK ARE A REALLY GOOD BET 
THEY'RE SOLIDLY MADE AND THEY'RE PRACTICALLY DESIGNED 
YOU COME THROUGH THE DOOR YOU'VE GOT THIS ENTRANCE HALL SOMEWHERE TO HANG YOUR COATS 
YOU'VE GOT THE STAIRS UP TO THE THREE BEDROOMS 
LOOKS LIKE THIS HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED TOO MUCH OVER THE YEARS 
SO GET THIS STRIPPED BACK AND I BET THERE ARE SOME NICE STAIR RODS UNDER THERE 
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO A REAR SITTING AREA AND THE KITCHEN 
THROUGH TO THE FRONT SITTING ROOM AND A NICE SIZED SPACE 
A BIG BOW FRONTED WINDOW A FANTASTIC VIEW OUT OVER THE HILLS 
SERVING HATCHES YOU DON'T SEE MANY OF THOSE THESE DAYS 
HERE'S ANOTHER FEATURE VERY NINETEEN THIRTIES I RECKON THIS IS ORIGINAL 
IT'S A FIREPLACE WITH THIS SORT OF GLAZED COVERING 
THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE YOU'LL EITHER LOVE OR HATE 
I PERSONALLY THINK IN THE RIGHT DECORATION IN HERE 
STRIPPED FLOORBOARDS THIS WOULD LOOK ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL 
YOU MIGHT BEG TO DIFFER BUT IN GENERAL A GREAT START 
THE SECOND RECEPTION ROOM AT THE BACK OF THE PROPERTY IS ALSO A GOOD SIZE 
I LOVE THE FLOORBOARDS BUT I'M NOT SO KEEN ON THAT FIREPLACE 
I'VE GOT A SLEDGE HAMMER ON STANDBY 
SO THROUGH HERE AND THE CLASSIC NINETEEN THIRTIES LAYOUT CONTINUES IN THE KITCHEN 
OBVIOUSLY IN NEED OF COMPLETE REFURBISHMENT AND SOME INTERESTING THINGS GOING ON IN THE CEILING 
BUT WE LIKE THE FACT THERE'S A HUGE GREAT WINDOW LOOKING OUT ONTO THE GARDEN 
THROUGH TO THE VERY REAR OF THE PROPERTY WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS SOME INTERESTING STUFF GOING ON 
THIS SIDE HERE IS THE ORIGINAL EXTENSION 
THAT'S GOT A PITCHED ROOF THAT'S FINE 
BUT ON THE SIDE OF THAT THEY'VE CONSTRUCTED THIS 
THIS HAS GOT A FLAT ROOF WHICH IS NEVER GOOD 
WORSE IT'S ONLY GOT A SINGLE SKIN IN TERMS OF THE BRICKWORK 
SO THAT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH DAMP 
BUT POTENTIALLY KNOCK THIS THROUGH AND YOU'LL END UP WITH A VERY USABLE SPACE 
THAT FLAT ROOF IS DEFINITELY GOING TO NEED TO BE SORTED OUT 
AND THE WINDOWS AROUND THE BACK OF THE HOUSE ARE JUST AS BAD AS THE ONES IN THE FRONT 
SO UPSTAIRS AND WHAT HAVE WE GOT THREE BEDROOMS 
ONE FAIRLY SMALL BOX ROOM AT THE FRONT NEXT TO IT A REALLY NICE SIZED DOUBLE MASTER BEDROOM 
A BATHROOM BUT REALLY 
IS THAT BATHROOM SUITE EVER GOING TO COME BACK IN FASHION 
I DON'T THINK SO AND IT GETS WORSE IN THE FINAL BEDROOM 
THESE WALLS AREN'T YELLOW FROM PAINT THEY'RE YELLOW ACTUALLY FROM NICOTINE 
IF I JUST COMPARE IT TO WHITE PAPER YOU CAN SEE 
THE CEILING IS EVEN WORSE 
A SOBERING REMINDER OF WHAT NICOTINE CAN DO 
I RECKON TO CLEAN THIS ROOM YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT MORE THAN SUGAR SOAP AND RUBBER GLOVES 
SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES 
SO THE HOUSE NEEDS A LOT OF WORK 
BUT THE GARDEN NEEDS A BULLDOZER 
UNBELIEVABLE YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE HOW FAR IT GOES BACK BUT BELIEVE ME IT'S A BIG PLOT 
AT THE MOMENT YOU'VE GOT TREES LIKE AN ARBORETUM 
YOU'VE GOT A MONKEY PUZZLE THERE A BEECH THERE A SILVER BIRCH 
THERE'S A ROWAN TREE AT THE BACK SYCAMORE 
IT JUST GOES ON AND ON AND ON 
I CAN EVEN SEE A HINT OF A GARAGE BACK THERE 
CLEARLY IF YOU CLEAR THIS 
YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE A HUGE AMOUNT OF SPACE 
AT THE MOMENT IT'S DEFINITELY A JUNGLE OUT HERE 
JUNGLE LOVE IT'S DRIVING ME MAD IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY 
TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THE GARDEN THE NEW OWNER MIGHT BE WISE TO GET 
A TREE SURGEON'S ADVICE ON WHAT TO REMOVE AND WHAT TO KEEP 
I'VE ASKED ALONG A LOCAL ESTATE AGENT TO TELL ME 
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF THIS HOUSE IF IT WAS COMPLETELY REFURBISHED 
IS THERE MUCH DEMAND IN THE AREA 
THIS PROPERTY IS IN WOLSTANTON A VERY FAMILY ORIENTATED AREA 
I'VE HAD A LOOK AROUND THE PROPERTY IS QUITE SPACIOUS 
THREE BEDROOMS SEMI DETACHED 
IT'S ON A GOOD CORNER PLOT THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE AROUND THE PROPERTY 
PLENTY OF PROVISION FOR PARKING 
HOWEVER THE PROPERTY DOES NEED WORK 
IT'S IN A LITTLE BIT OF A DILAPIDATED UNCARED FOR CONDITION 
VERY MUCH SO BUT OF COURSE THAT GIVES THE BUYER THE ABILITY 
TO ADD EXTRA VALUE TO THIS HOUSE 
IT HAD A GUIDE PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
SO COULD IT POTENTIALLY PROVIDE RENTAL INCOME FOR THE NEW OWNER 
A GOOD DEMAND FOR RENTAL HERE FAMILY SIZED HOME 
YOU'RE LOOKING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY AND SIX HUNDRED PER CALENDAR MONTH 
OF COURSE FIRST OF ALL THIS HOUSE DOES NEED A FULL REFURBISHMENT 
ONCE ALL THAT IS DONE MAYBE THE NEW OWNER WOULD BE TEMPTED TO SELL HOW MUCH COULD IT BE WORTH 
RESALE VALUE IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY AND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
WELL THAT SOUNDS PROMISING FIFTY TO SIXTY PER CENT ABOVE THE GUIDE PRICE 
BUT HOW MUCH WILL THE REFURBISHMENT COST 
EVERY POUND OVER THE GUIDE PRICE PAID BY THE NEW OWNER WILL REDUCE THAT PROFIT 
WELL IT'S A WELL BUILT HOUSE ON A SIZABLE CORNER PLOT 
BUT THERE'S NO GETTING AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT AS YOU CAN SEE 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF WORK TO GET THIS PLACE UP TO SCRATCH 
THE GARDEN ALONE IS GOING TO TAKE A WEEK OR SO TO SORT OUT 
SO WHO HAD THE POWER TOOLS AND THE DESIRE TO TAKE THIS ON LET'S GO TO THE AUCTION AND FIND OUT 
LOT NUMBER SEVENTY SIX THIS IS A SEMI DETACHED HOUSE 
IT DOES NEED UPDATING SO WHAT SHALL WE SAY FOR LOT SEVENTY SIX 
A LOT OF INTEREST IN THIS ONE 
ONE HUNDRED TO START 
A BID THANK YOU ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIVE STANDING LEFT 
AT ONE HUNDRED FIVE 
ONE HUNDRED TEN IS IT NOW AT ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND BIDS LEFT AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
TAKE ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN TWO AND A HALF 
THAT TAKES ME TO ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR SIR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YOU'RE OUT 
AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BID'S THERE AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
I'M SELLING IT AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
YOU BOUGHT IT SIR WELL DONE 
THAT SUCCESSFUL FINAL BID OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WAS MADE BY DAVID 
HE ALREADY LIVES IN STAFFORDSHIRE 
HE PAID TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OVER THE GUIDE PRICE FOR THIS HOUSE WITH A JUNGLE AT THE FRONT 
AND THE BACK LET'S HOPE HE'S A KEEN GARDENER 
I MET UP WITH HIM BACK AT THE PROPERTY TO FIND OUT HIS REASON FOR BUYING IT 
I'VE RECENTLY RETIRED FROM BEING IN BUSINESS OPERATING A CARE HOME FOR NEARLY TWENTY THREE YEARS 
SO I THOUGHT TIME TO MOVE ON I WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED IN PROPERTY 
AND RUNNING THE CARE HOME THERE WAS ALWAYS MAINTENANCE JOBS TO DO 
EVERYTHING FROM PLUMBING ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
SO I THOUGHT LET'S START LOOKING AT DOING UP PROPERTIES 
I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF SELF BUILDS OVER THE YEARS WOW YEAH LITERALLY FROM SCRATCH YES 
I'VE GOT FRIENDS FAMILY WHO ARE INVOLVED 
IN THE BUILDING BUSINESS PLUMBING PLASTERING ELECTRICIAN WHATEVER 
SO BASICALLY ROPED THEM IN 
DID MY FIRST BUILD ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO 
ENJOYED IT HANDS ON TOTALLY 
EVERYTHING FROM MIXING CEMENT TO CLEARING THE SITE PLUMBING THE WHOLE LOT 
AND THEN IT LED ON FROM THERE 
WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS WILL YOU TAKE ON 
I WANTED TO DO ANOTHER SORT OF BUILDING PLOT 
BUT THE PLOTS WE WERE LOOKING AT AT AUCTION 
WE MISSED OUT ON A COUPLE OF THEM BECAUSE OF OBVIOUSLY THE PRICE 
THEY'VE GONE SKY HIGH 
SO THE NEXT THING WAS TO LOOK AT A RENOVATION AND LEARN FROM THAT 
SO THIS IS THE FIRST ONE 
DAVID HAS HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN SELF BUILDS 
BUT RENOVATING A PROPERTY LIKE THIS AS A BUSINESS VENTURE 
IS A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR HIM SO WHAT ARE HIS PLANS 
BASICALLY WE WON'T RENT IT WE'RE GOING TO DO THE RENOVATION 
TRY AND DO IT PRETTY HIGH SPEC IT'S A NICE FAMILY HOME 
SOMEBODY PERHAPS MOVING UP THE LADDER FROM LET'S SAY A TERRACE 
NEXT STEP UP THE LADDER 
BASICALLY IT DOESN'T NEED A LOT OF STRUCTURAL WORK REALLY 
WE'RE LOOKING AT A BUDGET OF AROUND FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
THE BIG COST IS GOING TO BE OUT THERE IN THAT GARDEN 
I SHARE DAVID'S CONCERN 
WITH TREES SO CLOSE TO THE HOUSE LET'S HOPE THE ROOTS HAVEN'T UNDERMINED THE FOUNDATIONS 
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO INSIDE 
GENERALLY IT'S JUST OBVIOUSLY REDECORATING TRYING TO GET THIS WOODCHIP OFF THE WALL 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT'S GOT QUITE A NEW CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEM WHICH IS A BONUS 
WHAT ABOUT THE KITCHEN AND FLAT ROOF THAT'S A PROBLEM 
THERE'S THE WOODEN FRAME WINDOW AREA LOTS OF ROT IN THERE IT ALL NEEDS TO COME OFF 
WHETHER OR NOT WE OPEN IT UP AND PUT SOME SORT OF GARDEN ROOM ON IT WHICH MIGHT BE A NICE FEATURE 
OR EXTEND THE KITCHEN OUT WE'LL HAVE TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE THINGS 
A GOOD FIFTEEN THOUSAND WOULD SORT THIS OUT 
SO WHO'S DOING HIS PROJECT 
I'M BASICALLY DOING IT BY MYSELF 
IT'S LIKE THE SELF BUILD AT THE MOMENT 
I'M THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE PHONING PEOPLE CAN YOU GET HERE 
WHAT TIME ARE YOU GOING TO BE HERE WHERE'S MY SAND THAT SORT OF THING 
ALSO HANDS ON I'LL BE DOING THE SCRAPING TAKING THE STUFF OUT TO THE SKIP ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF 
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW YOU TRANSFORM IT 
RIGHT I'LL BE BACK IN A FEW MONTHS TO SEE HOW YOU'VE GOT ON THAT WOULD BE GREAT WELL DONE 
DAVID HAS EXPERIENCE HE WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN ON A SELF BUILD PROPERTY 
THREE YEARS AGO IF HE WASN'T CONFIDENT 
AND FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS HE LOOKED AFTER THE MAINTENANCE OF HIS CARE HOME 
BUT WILL THIS PROPERTY PRODUCE SOME NASTY SHOCKS 
SO HOW IS DAVID GOING TO GET ON RESTORING THIS PLACE 
AND IN PARTICULAR TAMING THAT JUNGLE OF A GARDEN 
YOU CAN FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW 
IT'S TIME TO GO BACK TO THOSE PROPERTIES AND SEE HOW THE OWNERS HAVE GOT ON 
HAVE THEY STUCK TO THEIR TIMESCALES AND BUDGETS LET'S FIND OUT 
IN STROOD JUST OUTSIDE ROCHESTER IN KENT JASON AND ALAN HAVE BOUGHT THIS THREE BED SEMI FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
IT WAS TO BE THEIR FIRST DEVELOPMENT TOGETHER 
WHAT'S THE HISTORY WITH YOU TWO HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN EACH OTHER 
AROUND FIFTEEN YEARS NOW JASON WAS MY BEST MAN AT MY WEDDING 
I THINK JUST OVER THE YEARS OUR WIVES ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS 
AND THROUGH THAT WE'VE SORT OF GELLED TOGETHER AS WELL 
JUST TWO MONTHS LATER WE'RE BACK TO CHECK ON PROGRESS 
THE BOYS HAVE PUT IN LOTS OF LATE NIGHTS BUT THE LONG HOURS SEEM TO HAVE PAID OFF 
THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE HAS BEEN PAINTED 
INSIDE THEY'VE RE PLASTERED MANY OF THE ROOMS 
A NEW KITCHEN HAS BEEN FITTED 
PLUS A GREAT NEW BATHROOM 
BUT IT'S STILL DOWNSTAIRS 
THAT MEANS THAT THREE BEDROOMS REMAIN UPSTAIRS BUT AGAIN THEY'VE ALL BEEN DECORATED 
THE HOUSE LOOKS STUNNING 
BUT AS ALAN EXPLAINS THEY'VE HAD A FEW PROBLEMS ALONG THE WAY 
MOST OF THE WALLS IN THE HOUSE WERE A REAL NIGHTMARE 
THERE WAS WOODCHIP OVER WOODCHIP OVER PLASTER OVER WOODCHIP 
WHEN WE STRIPPED ALL THE WALLS IT DIDN'T LOOK TOO BAD WHEN WE FIRST SAW THEM 
THERE WERE JUST BIG HOLES CRACKS PLASTER MISSING 
SO ALL THE WALLS HAVE BEEN RE PLASTERED SOME RELINED 
THEY COME UP QUITE NICE THE FINISH OF THE WALLS IS PRETTY GOOD 
I'M HAPPY WITH THE WAY THEY'VE COME OUT 
THE KITCHEN THAT WAS IN HERE BEFORE THERE WASN'T SO MANY UNITS IN HERE 
DIDN'T LIKE THE LAYOUT SO WE ACTUALLY HAD SOMEONE COME IN 
DO A LAYOUT OF THE KITCHEN REDESIGNED IT 
AND THIS IS THE FINISHED ARTICLE WHICH IS A MUCH BETTER LAYOUT 
THERE WASN'T TOO MANY PROBLEMS THE ONLY ONE THAT DID OCCUR WAS THAT 
THE WALLS WEREN'T SQUARE BUT WE OVERCAME THAT AND THE FINISHED ARTICLE LOOKS QUITE GOOD 
THERE WAS A HUGE FIREPLACE HERE AS YOU REMEMBER BEFORE 
A BIG YORK STONE FIREPLACE 
WE TOOK THE BRICKS OUT 
THEY WERE QUITE BIG AND HEAVY ACTUALLY 
MADE QUITE AN IMPACT ON THE FLOOR 
WE'VE GOT TO RENEW ONE OF THE FLOORBOARDS 
WE'VE HAD IT ALL RE PLASTERED AND I THINK IT LOOKS REALLY NICE NOW 
THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK HAS BEEN DONE BY ALAN AND JASON BUT THEY DID NEED TRADESMEN FOR SOME OF THE JOBS 
FINDING THEM TURNED OUT TO BE EASIER THAN EXPECTED 
THE DAY WE ACTUALLY STARTED ON A MONDAY 
THE GUY NEXT DOOR BOUGHT THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR TO RENOVATE AND IT TURNS OUT I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH HIM 
HE GAVE US A FEW HELPING POINTS ALONG THE WAY 
WE'VE USED SOME OF HIS CONTACTS AS WELL WHICH I ALSO WENT TO SCHOOL WITH 
JASON'S A DIRECTOR OF A CAR ACCIDENT REPAIR CENTRE 
WHEREAS ALAN FITS CAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS 
ALAN USED TO BE A PAINTER AND DECORATOR SO HE HAD SOME PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE TO CALL ON 
BUT FOR JASON IT WAS A NEW DEPARTURE 
IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT INDUSTRY BUT I DO ENJOY IT 
PROBABLY MORE SO THAN THE OTHER INDUSTRY I WAS IN 
STILL HAD THE OVERALLS HANGING IN THE SHED COULDN'T FIND THEM 
HAD TO GO AND BUY SOME NEW ONES 
SO PROBABLY A SIZE BIGGER BUT IT'S BEEN GOOD GETTING BACK INTO IT 
A LOT OF THINGS COME FLOODING BACK WHEN YOU START PAINTING 
IT'S BEEN REALLY REWARDING 
THE END RESULTS CLEARLY SHOW THAT ALAN HASN'T LOST HIS TOUCH 
WERE THERE ANY BRUSH UPS BETWEEN THEM OR DID THEY JUST ROLL WITH IT 
WE HAD A BIT OF A LAUGH AND JOKE WITH ALAN TRYING TO FIT A RADIATOR AND FLOODING THE LOUNGE 
BASICALLY THE THERMOSTAT RAD VALVE HADN'T TURNED OFF 
AND I HAD TO DO IT LIVE THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF WATER 
WE CLEARED IT UP BUT I'M NEVER GOING TO LIVE IT DOWN 
SO THE ODD DISASTER HERE AND THERE AND MORE PREPARATION WORK ON THE WALLS THAN EXPECTED 
HAS THE BUDGET ALSO BEEN WASHED AWAY 
WE BUDGETED BETWEEN SIX THOUSAND TO EIGHT THOUSAND FOR THE PROJECT 
IT'S COME IN JUST A SHADE OVER SIX THOUSAND 
SO WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE BUDGET 
SIX THOUSAND SEEMS FANTASTICALLY LOW FOR THE IMPROVEMENTS DONE HERE 
YET AGAIN IT SHOWS HOW DOING THE WORK YOURSELF SAVES SO MUCH MONEY 
THAT'S KEPT JASON AND ALAN'S TOTAL SPEND BELOW ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
BUT ARE MARKET CONDITIONS GOOD ENOUGH TO SEE A RETURN 
WHAT DO TWO LOCAL AGENTS THINK 
THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB WITH THIS HOUSE 
THEY'VE REDECORATED IT MADE IT NICE AND PLAIN 
MADE IT NICE AND SIMPLE FOR SOMEONE TO MOVE STRAIGHT INTO 
LOOKING AROUND THE PROPERTY IT'S VERY MODERN 
EVERYTHING'S NEUTRAL YOU'RE ABLE TO DO YOUR OWN THING 
IT'S UP TO MODERN DAY STANDARDS 
AN IDEAL FAMILY HOME YOU CAN MOVE STRAIGHT IN 
I LIKE THE KITCHEN AND BATHROOM THEY'RE A GOOD SIZE 
THE DOWNSIDE IS THE BATHROOM IS DOWNSTAIRS BUT IT DOES GIVE YOU THREE GOOD SIZED BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS' 
A GREAT SIZED GARDEN GREAT FOR ENTERTAINING 
GREAT IN THE SUMMER IT'S LOW MAINTENANCE 
AGAIN IT'S GOOD FOR A FAMILY IT'S A REALLY NICE SIZE 
ALAN AND JASON PAID ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND FOR THE HOUSE AND SPENT ABOUT SIX THOUSAND 
SO THEY'LL BE HOPING FOR A VALUATION OF AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
IF YOU WERE TO PUT THE PROPERTY ON THE MARKET TODAY IT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND 
I'D PUT THIS ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND 
REALLY THAT'S GOOD PLEASED WITH THAT REALLY HAPPY WITH THAT 
YEAH THAT'S MORE THAN WE EXPECTED REALLY THAT'S QUALITY 
IT COULD MEAN A THIRTY THOUSAND PROFIT FOR EIGHT WEEKS' WORK MINUS DEDUCTIONS 
DEFINITELY CAUSE TO GO OUT AND CELEBRATE 
WE HAVEN'T REALLY GONE FOR A PINT WENT DOWN THE CAFE WE GO DOWN FOR A TREAT EVERY FRIDAY 
BUT WE'VE GOT ON REALLY WELL AND WE'VE HAD A GOOD LAUGH AND JOKE 
IT'S BEEN GOOD THERE'S BEEN NO STRAIN ON OUR FRIENDSHIP AT ALL 
WE JUST WORK WELL TOGETHER 
SO THE TRIAL RUN'S GONE WELL THEY'VE ENJOYED WORKING TOGETHER 
THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB AND HAVE MADE SOME MONEY 
SO PRESUMABLY IT'S STRAIGHT ON TO THE NEXT ONE 
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN AGAIN 
YEAH WE ARE WE VIEWED A PROPERTY THAT'S IN THE AUCTION NEXT FRIDAY 
AND WE WILL BE ATTENDING THE AUCTION AND HOPEFULLY WILL HAVE A GO AT THAT PROPERTY THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN 
SEE YOU THERE 
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN AGAIN 
IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVEN'T SEEN OR HEARD THE LAST OF THESE TWO 
THEY COULD BE COMING TO AN AUCTION ROOM NEAR YOU VERY SOON 
YOU KNOW THAT FAVOURITE ESTATE AGENT EXPRESSION VIEWING HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
WELL FROM THE ROAD THAT WAS A BIT OF A PROBLEM FOR THIS THREE BEDROOM SEMI IN STAFFORDSHIRE 
BUT THAT DIDN'T DETER DAVID 
ON AUCTION DAY HE DECIDED THAT HE'D PART WITH ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR IT 
HE USED TO OWN A CARE HOME WITH HIS WIFE LINDA BUT SOLD THE BUSINESS 
HE'S ALSO NOW IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING 
A BRAND NEW HOUSE FROM SCRATCH SO HE WAS GOING TO BE PRETTY BUSY 
SIX MONTHS HAVE PASSED AND WE'VE COME BACK 
FROM THE OUTSIDE YOU CAN SEE THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF GARDENING 
NOW YOU CAN REALLY APPRECIATE THE SIZE OF THIS CORNER PLOT 
A BRAND NEW CONSERVATORY'S BEEN CONSTRUCTED WHERE THE LEAN TO WAS 
AND NEW WINDOWS ARE BEING INSTALLED 
INSIDE THE FIREPLACE IN THE FRONT ROOM HAS BEEN REMOVED 
AND IT'S THE SAME IN THE BACK ROOM 
THE KITCHEN HAS BEEN RIPPED RIGHT OUT TILES AND ALL IT'S BACK TO THE BRICKWORK 
UPSTAIRS THE REFURBISHMENT IS MORE ADVANCED BEDROOMS ARE BEING DECORATED 
BATHROOMS TILED AND THE APPLIANCES ARE READY TO BE PLUMBED IN 
BUT DEFINITELY THE BIGGEST CHANGE I'VE SEEN IS OUTSIDE IN THAT OVERGROWN JUNGLE 
THE GARDEN WELL THAT WAS THE FIRST JOB REALLY 
WE NEEDED TO OPEN UP THE GARDEN 
BECAUSE YOU JUST COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING I MEAN THAT OLD GARAGE THAT'S OUT THERE 
WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS PART OF THIS PLOT 
THE TREE SURGEONS CAME IN 
FOUR DAYS OF JUST CHOPPING CUTTING AND DIGGING 
THE ONLY THING WE RETAINED WAS THE MONKEY PUZZLE TREE 
WHICH I WANTED TO KEEP 
AS THE TREE SURGEONS ONLY TOOK FOUR DAYS I'M PUZZLED WHY MORE HASN'T BEEN ACHIEVED AFTER SIX MONTHS 
THE MAIN REASON FOR THE HOLD UP 
I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ON THIS PLACE FOR AT LEAST SIX WEEKS BECAUSE I WAS DOING A SELF BUILD 
WE WERE AT THE STAGE WHEN I BOUGHT THIS 
OF JUST STARTING THE SECOND FIX 
SO THIS HAD TO BASICALLY STAND THERE DOING NOTHING ON IT PERHAPS POPPING DOWN FOR THE WEEKENDS 
WITH MY NEPHEW HE DID ALL THE LABOURING IN HERE 
HE GOT ALL THE WALLPAPER OFF THE WALLS I JUST GAVE HIM THE KEYS 
AND SAID RIGHT I'LL PICK YOU UP AT SIX O'CLOCK 
AS DAVID PUTS THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO THE NEW HOUSE HIS NEPHEW TACKLED MOST OF THE INITIAL WORK 
ON THIS THREE BEDROOM SEMI 
O. K. THIS WAS THE UTILITY 
IT WANTED A LOT OF WORK DOING ON IT 
WE'VE BASICALLY HAD THE OLD WOODEN WINDOWS REPLACED 
THERE WAS A LOW LEVEL WALL ALL THE WAY ROUND HERE 
WE TOOK THE WALL OUT PUT THE FRENCH WINDOWS IN 
TOOK THE CEILINGS DOWN THE ROOF WAS ROTTEN 
BASICALLY AND THE WHOLE LOT HAD TO COME OFF 
THE OUTSIDE AS WELL WE'RE GOING TO FLAG IT AND HAVE A NICE GARDEN AREA NICE GARDEN ROOM 
OR IT COULD BE TURNED BACK TO A UTILITY 
DAVID PAID ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR THIS HOUSE 
THE LAYOUT DOWNSTAIRS HAS CERTAINLY BEEN IMPROVED 
BUT THE BIG CHALLENGE HAS BEEN UPSTAIRS IN THE FRONT BEDROOM 
O. K. THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE SMOKING ROOM 
REALLY HORRENDOUS I MEAN WE MUST HAVE WORKED ON THIS FOR FOUR DAYS 
ONCE WE GOT MOST OF THE NICOTINE OFF THE WALLS AND CEILING 
WE STARTED TO PAINT IT AFTER THREE COATS IT WAS STILL COMING THROUGH SO WE HAD TO GO AND BUY 
ONE OF THESE ANTI STAIN PAINTS TWO COATS OF THAT AND THAT SEEMED TO DO THE JOB 
ANOTHER COAT OF EMULSION AND YOU CAN SEE IT NOW IT'S A HELL OF A LOT BETTER I MEAN WHAT A JOB 
AT LEAST ON HIS NEW BUILD THE ONLY MUCK WAS OUTSIDE IN THE FOOTINGS 
SO WHAT'S BEEN THE MOST ENJOYABLE PROJECT REFURBISHING THIS HOUSE 
OR BUILDING THE OTHER ONE FROM SCRATCH 
COMPARING IT TO SELF BUILDING OR A NEW BUILD UM I THINK NEW BUILD IS A LOT EASIER 
YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF HOURS INVOLVED WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT YOURSELF 
LONG HOURS AND LOTS OF MONEY BEING SPENT A COMMON PROBLEM HOW HAS DAVID'S EXPENDITURE GONE 
COST WISE UP TO THE PRESENT DAY I THINK I'VE SPENT ABOUT NINE THOUSAND 
I'VE GOT THE KITCHEN WHICH I'VE ESTIMATED AT AROUND ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED 
AND THEN THE WORK TO BE DONE OUTSIDE JUST AROUND THE GARDEN 
PAVING THINGS LIKE THAT PROBABLY ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND 
WELL THAT ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PROJECTED BUDGET ON TOP OF THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HE PAID AT AUCTION 
WOULD TAKE DAVID'S INVESTMENT TO ALMOST ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
TIME TO HEAR IF TWO LOCAL PROPERTY EXPERTS THINK IT'S BEEN WORTH IT 
THE CORNER PLOT IS A GOOD SELLING POINT ON THIS PROPERTY 
IT WILL APPEAL TO PURCHASERS BECAUSE OFF ROAD PARKING IS A NECESSITY 
WHEN WE CAME TO THE PROPERTY THE FIRST TIME ROUND 
THE GARDEN WAS VERY VERY OVERGROWN 
IT LOOKED VERY SMALL NOW IT'S BEEN CUT BACK YOU CAN SEE THE SIZE OF THE PLOT 
THE PROPERTY IS WELL SIZED 
IT'S TYPICAL TO HAVE A BOX ROOM IN A THREE BEDROOM SEMI 
BUT THE PROPORTIONS ARE QUITE ADEQUATE 
HOW MUCH COULD THE HOUSE FETCH ONCE FINISHED DAVID WILL NEED TO CLEAR AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND TO SEE A PROFIT 
WHEN RENOVATED 
WE'D BE LOOKING AT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
I'D PUT THIS PROPERTY ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY WHEN FINISHED 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S ABOUT A GOOD FAIR PRICE 
I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING AROUND THAT FIGURE 
SO YEAH I'LL BE HAPPY WITH THAT PRICE 
DAVID'S NEW BUILD IS NOW COMPLETE 
SO HE CAN CONCENTRATE ALL HIS TIME FINISHING OFF THIS PROPERTY 
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'LL BE A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW 
ONCE WE COMPLETED THE HOUSE I HAD TO GET THE BUILDING INSPECTOR BACK 
I THINK THEY WERE QUITE IMPRESSED WITH THE BUILD QUALITY AND THE STYLE OF THE HOUSE 
WE'VE BEEN NOMINATED FOR AN AWARD 
FOR THE BUILD QUALITY AND TRADITIONAL STYLE OF BUILD 
WELL WE WISH DAVID LUCK 
WHO KNOWS HE MIGHT EVEN GET NOMINATED FOR ANOTHER GONG 
IN THE GREAT REFURBISHMENT OF CORNER PROPERTY CATEGORY 
HE DESERVES TO WELL DONE 
WE'LL HAVE SOME MORE FASCINATING AUCTION PROPERTIES FOR YOU NEXT TIME 
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN GOODBYE GOODBYE
