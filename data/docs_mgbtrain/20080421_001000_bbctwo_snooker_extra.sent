WELCOME BACK TO THE CRUCIBLE THIS 
SNOOKER EXTRA PROGRAMME WILL BRING 
RYAN DAY TIME TO THIS SLOT HE IS 
THE WELSH MAN WHO HAS CLIMBED HIS 
WAY INTO THE TOP SIXTEEN OF THE WORLD 
RANKING HIS FIRST ROUND OPPONENT 
MICHAEL JUDGE THIRTY FOUR IN THE WORLD 
RANKINGS NOT THAT THE CRUCIBLE HAS 
MUCH RESPECT FOR CURRENT FORM THE 
FIRST TWO FRAMES WERE SHARED THE 
COMMENTARY IS BY TERRY GRIFFITHS 
AND JOHN VIRGO 
A GOOD POT LOVELY SOUND OF IT 
HITTING THE MIDDLE OF THE POCKET 
CRACK IT GIVES YOU A BIT MORE 
CRACK IT GIVES YOU A BIT MORE CONFIDENT THE PINK LOOKS TIGHT IF 
IT DOES GO IT IS NOT A GOOD ANGLE 
TO STAY DOWN FOR THE RED IT DOES 
GO 
THAT WAS SO MOVES NICE THE REASON 
HE REFUSED THE PINK HE WAS HOPING 
TO BE STRAIGHT ON IT 
PLAYING THE BLUE WHICH HE PLAYED 
BEAUTIFULLY AND NOW HE WOULD BE 
LOOKING IMMEDIATELY TO GETTING ONTO 
THE RED JUST LEFT OF THE BLACK 
AFTER POTTING THIS BLACK 
BECAUSE THAT IN EFFECT WILL CLEAR THE BLACK FOR BOTH CORNER POCKET 
IT IS EARLY DOORS BUT SIGN THAT 
RYAN DAY IS SETTLING IN AND HE HAS 
GOT THAT CUE ARM MOVING YES YOU 
YES YOU ARE RIGHT JOHN YOU CAN TELL WITH 
THE BODY LANGUAGE RYAN ALWAYS 
LOOKS VERY EDGY IN THE FIRST FEW 
FRAMES BUT NOW HE LOOKS CALMER OUT 
THERE HE IS MOVING AROUND THE 
TABLE IN A NICE RHYTHM IN PREVIOUS 
FRAMES HE SEEMED TO BE RUSHING 
BETWEEN SHOTS AND THEN TAKING TOO 
LONG TO PLAY THE SHOTS WHICH IS 
CERTAINLY NOT HIS WAY 
IF HE COULD HAVE PICKED THE CUE 
BALL UP AND PUT IT THERE WITH HIS 
HAND HE COULD NOT HAVE FOUND A 
BETTER PLACE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU 
PLAY A GOOD SHOT IT IS NOT LOOK 
THAT THINGS TURN OUT NICELY FOR YOU 
A FRAME WINNING CHANCE NOW YOU YOU CANNOT SAY THE WELSH ARE LUCKY 
THAT IS DISCRIMINATION WHAT IS HAPPENING 
I DIDN'T SAY THE WELSH HAPPENING 
LUCKY I SAID THEY WON THE 
WERE LUCKY I SAID THEY WON THE KEY THEY WERE LEEKEY 
A BIT UNLUCKY THERE HE HAD CONTACT 
WITH THE RED THAT HE WAS TRYING TO 
GET THE PAST GET PAST 
HE IS LUCKY TO GET THAT AND IT IS 
IN 
DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE 
RUNNING INTO THE CLUSTER OF FOUR 
RIGHT OF THE PINK DON'T BLAME HIM 
YOU WOULD THINK THE BLUE AND JUST 
ONE MORE RED WOULD BE REQUIRED 
FOR EVERY RED THAT IS POTTED THAT 
MEANS EIGHT HAVE GONE OFF THE 
POTENTIAL SCORE EIGHT POINT 
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO SEE A 
CENTURY BREAK THERE BUT IT WON'T 
MATTER TO RYAN DAY HE NOW LEADS TWO 
ONE 
AFTER THAT VERY EASY BLACK THAT 
MICHAEL MISSED HE IS BACK TO THE TABLE SOONER THAN HE THOUGHT 
IT IS O. K. FOR A MINUTE IT LOOKED 
LIKE IT COULD BE TOUCHING THE BROWN 
AND HE WAS ON NOTHING HE HAS GOT 
THE GREEN OR YELLOW 
HE NEEDED A GOOD POSITIONAL SHOT 
AND HE HASN'T GOT IT IT SEEMED TO 
COME OFF THE CUSHION RATHER QUICKLY 
AT LEAST END EXTRA FOOT OF RON ON 
THE CUE BALL AND BECAUSE OF THAT 
HE IS OUT OF POSITION 
I AM NOT 
QUITE CERTAIN WHETHER I WOULD PLAY 
IN THE CUSHION OR NOT HE WAS A 
LITTLE BIT THINNER ON THE GREEN TO 
STUN IT OFF THE SIDE CUSHION IF 
THE RED AT THE BOTTOM WOULD HAVE 
GONE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER 
ROLLING IT IN WHATEVER IT WENT 
WRONG SO RYAN NOT PUNISHED FOR THE 
LONG RED THAT HE MISSED 
HE HAS HAD A GOOD LUCK AT THIS RED 
AND TAKING HIS TIME YOU CAN SEE 
WHY BRIDGING OVER THE BROWN WHAT 
A SHOT 
LOOK AT THE SIDE THAT HE 
HAD TO PUT ON AS WELL IT TAKES IT 
TO THE SIDE CUSHION BACK TO THE 
BAULK END IT WAS ONE OF THOSE IF 
HE DOESN'T POT THE RED THE CUE 
BALL COULD HAVE GONE ANYWHERE 
SHORT OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP SO FAR 
SHOT 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT SHOT SHOT IF HE DIDN'T HAVE PROBLEMS 
WITH HIS BRIDGE IF HE HAD HIS HAND 
ON THE TABLE IT STILL WOULD HAVE 
BEEN A GREAT SHOT 
HE COULD JUST HIT ONE SIDE OF THE 
CUE BALL HE THREW THE CUE BALL 
THE CUE AT IT BASICALLY LAUNCHED 
IT LIKE JAVELIN WHAT PITY 
AFTER THAT OPENING RED I THOUGHT 
MAYBE HE HAS GOT A CHANCE OF 
WINNING THE FRAME BUT ONCE AGAIN 
AS WE HAVE SEEN FROM BOTH PLAYERS 
IT SEEMS AT THE MOMENT THAT WHEN 
THEY GET THESE JUST OFF STRAIGHT 
POT THEY ARE NOT GETTING THROUGH 
THE CUE BALL PROPERLY 
IT IS THE 
MID DISTANCE ONES NOT THE LONG 
SHOT HE WAS ONLY SIX F. T. AWAY BUT IF 
YOU MISS ONE OF THEM EARLY ON LIKE 
BOTH PLAYERS HAVE THE NEXT TIME 
YOU GO DOWN THERE YOU ARE THINKING 
MORE ABOUT YOUR CUE ACTION THEN 
POTTING THE BALL 
INSTINCT SHOULD TAKEOVER IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO GET RID OF POTS THAT 
WENT BEFORE SOMETIMES JOHN 
IT IS 
LIKE IN GOAL WHEN YOU PUSH IT TO 
THE RIGHT ON THE FIRST HOLE AND 
THEN ON THE NEXT HOLE YOU END UP 
HAWKING IT LEFT SO THAT YOU DON'T 
PUSH IT TO THE RIGHT WHEN YOU 
FINISH A BALL YOU HAVE GOT TO 
ERASE IT OUT OF YOUR MIND EASIER 
SAID THAN DONE 
THIS IS THE LAST FRAME BEFORE THE 
MID SESSION INTERVAL RYAN WOULD BE 
WELL PLEASED TO TAKE A TWO FRAME 
ADVANTAGE INTO THE INTERVAL 
INTERESTING MATCH THOUGH THERE HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING GOING ON 
EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN MISSES THERE 
HAS BEEN SOMETHING TO ENJOY ABOUT 
IT YES AT TIMES YOU CAN GET A BIT IT OF BOREDOM WHEN SOMEONE IS GOING TO 
MAKE EVERY SHOT SKILL IS NEEDED 
THAT BUT IT IS MORE INTERESTING 
WHEN YOU GET MISTAKES AND TWISTS 
AND TURNS IN A FRAME 
WELL PLAYED 
THAT WAS A SUPER SHOT 
HIS CONFIDENCE IS RISING 
ANOTHER UNEXPECTED MISS NOT THAT 
IT HAS COME AS A SURPRISE THE WAY 
THIS MATCH HAS GONE 
THE DEALER WAS 
FIVE TIMES MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE 
RED AND HE CANNOT BELIEVE IT THE 
YELLOW 
SOMETIMES THERE IS NO RHYME AND 
REASON HE HAS MISSED A COUPLE OF 
DOLLY BLACKS FROM THIS BOX AND YET 
HE KNOCKS THESE LONG ONES IN 
IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT 
TO CLEAR UP FROM HERE BUT IT LOOKS 
IMPOSSIBLE NOW HE IS NOT AS 
INTENDED ON THE YELLOW 
HE CAN POT TO THE YELLOW BUT HE 
COULD NOT GET CLOSE TO THE GREEN 
ALL HE WOULD BE DOING IS PUTTING 
THE YELLOW AND THEN PLAYING A 
SAFETY SHOT SO IT IS A CASE OF 
WHERE 
THE CUE BALL 
LEAVE THE CUE BALL 
CONSIDERING HE WAS SO CLOSE TO THE 
CUSHION THAT WAS ON EXCELLENT SHOT 
AN EXCELLENT SHOT HE HAD TO HIT 
THE YELLOW ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
OTHERWISE IT COULD HAVE RUN INTO 
THE PINK OR BLACK 
IT IS NOT TOO BAD HE HAS LEFT 
YELLOW BUT HE HAS KNOCKED THE BLUE 
BALL SAFE 
HE CAUGHT THAT MUCH TOO SOON 
MUCH TOO THIN HE HAS GIVEN MICHAEL 
JUDGE AD CHANCE TO POT IT 
RYAN DAY UP THE LAST DOES IT 
PLAYED A TREMENDOUS SAFETY SHOT ON 
THE YELLOW AND THEN THE SIMPLE SHOT 
ON THE GREEN AND LEFT IT ON AT 
THE LAST VISIT 
HE NEEDS THIS BLUE HE COULD PLAY THIS BUT HE WOULD NOT PUT A LOT OF PACE INTO IT WHAT A GREAT SHOT HE CAN SHAKE HIS HEAD BUT IT WAS A 
VERY POOR SAFETY THAT HE PLAYED ON 
THE GREEN 
HE PLAYED THAT DEAD WEIGHT IT WAS 
ALWAYS THE CHANCE PUTTED WOULD 
DRIFT OFF WITH THE HAND BOX ON THE 
TABLE THAT IT WOULD DRIFT OFF 
WITH THE HAND MARKS 
JUST A LITTLE SHORT OF PACE THERE 
AGAIN FROM RYAN DAY THE BLACK IS 
IN A GOOD POSITION THERE FOR HIM TO 
TRY TO GET THE ONE SNOOKER BUT HE 
NEEDS BUT HE NEEDS THAT HE NEEDS 
I DO NOT THINK EITHER PLAYER WILL 
BE HAPPY IF IT DOES BREAK TO TWO 
ALL 
THEY CAN REFLECT ON SOME OF ALL THE SHOTS THAT THEY HAVE MISSED 
FROM A MATCH POINT OF VIEW BOTH 
PLAYERS HAVE HAD CHANCES AND 
SETTLED INTO IT 
LOOK AT THAT I WAS GOING TO SAY 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS TO GET 
THE PINK SAFE AND IT COULD NOT BE 
SAFE HE COULD NOT BE SAFER THAN 
THAT 
WELL WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT YOU 
WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT HE COULD GET 
RAINED NO MISS WILL BE CALLED 
BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE SNOOKERS 
REQUIRED STAGE BUT THERE IS STILL 
THE GO AGAIN RULE WHICH I'M SURE 
RYAN DAY WILL IMPLEMENT 
WITH WHAT 
HAS GONE ON SO FAR IN THIS MATCH 
YOU WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF RYAN 
DAY WINS THE FRAME 
RYAN DAY STILL NEED PINK AND BLACK 
BUT THE WAY THE BLACK IS POSITIONED 
IT IS FIRST TO GET PINK REALLY 
IS HE GOING TO TAKE THIS ON HE WAS 
LOOKING AT AN ANGLE TO GET AROUND 
TO POT THE BLACK 
I THINK IT IS AN 
ALL OR NOTHING 
THAT IS THE WRONG SHOT EVEN IF HE 
WINS THE FRAME I STILL THINK IT 
WAS A TERRIBLE CHOICE YOU GET THAT 
PINK IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOUR 
KIND TO A GOOD TEN FOUR CLIMBS OUT 
OF TEN 
IT HAS BEEN VERY INTERESTING BUT 
THAT PINK FROM MICHAEL JUDGE HAS 
BROUGHT HIM BACK INTO IT 
EITHER PLAYER SO FAR HAS GONE OUT 
THERE AND GRASPS THE GAME THEY 
HAVE BOTH HAD CHANCES 
THAT IS THE 
MAIN POINT THEY HAVE HAD THEIR 
CHANCES PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING DAY 
RYAN DAY 
IN AN EFFORT TO HIT IT VERY THIN 
HE MISSED BALL COMPLETELY 
HE HAS HAD A LOOK ROUND AND WITH 
THE BLACK TIED UP IT MAY BE WORTH 
TRYING TO DISLODGE THE 
IT IS NOT EASY TO MAKE BREAKS FROM 
BLUE AND BAULK COLOURS 
THE PINK SPOT IS AVAILABLE IT WILL 
GO INTO ONE OF THE CORNERS AND 
POSSIBLY BOTH MEDALS MIDDLES 
I AM NOT QUITE SURE WHAT HE PLAYED 
TEN HE HAS NOT ON A RED 
WE HAVE SEEN ALREADY IN THESE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS UP THE RED CAN MOVE 
UP THE TABLE IF YOU AIM TOWARDS THE 
FAR NAP 
I AM NOT GOING TO SAY IT IS A 
FRAME WINNING CHANCE THE WAY 
THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING HERE 
HE HAS UNDERDONE CLARKE SLIGHTLY 
HE WOULD PREFER TO P. STRAIGHTER ON 
CLUB PINK BE STRAIGHTER ON THE 
PINK 
ALL PINKS SO FAR IN THIS EFFORT 
FROM RYAN DAY THIS BLUE AND ONE MORE RED NEEDED 
WHEN YOU MAKE A MISTAKE AND YOUR 
OPPONENT DOES NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE 
YOU CAN EASILY OPERATED FROM YOUR 
MIND MICHAEL JUDGE NEEDS TO STEP 
UP A LITTLE OFF THE MATCH COULD 
MOVE AWAY FROM HIM 
NOW A CHANCE FOR THE FIRST CENTURY 
BREAK IN THIS MATCH 
THAT JUST ABOUT SUMS UP THE MATCH 
SO FAR JUST WHEN IT LOOKS TO BE 
GETTING EASY IT GET HARD 
THAT IS A VERY POOR SAFETY SHOT HE 
HAS LEFT RYAN DAY WITH AN EASY 
STARTER NOT THE EASIEST POSITION 
TO MAKE A BREAK WITH THE BLACK 
ONLY AVAILABLE TO ONE POCKET 
IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION IT IS 
USUALLY THE FIRST COUPLE OF 
POSITIONAL SHOTS THAT DECIDE HOW 
MUCH YOU CAN GET FROM THE 
OPPORTUNITY 
UNSURPRISED HE IS NOT PLAYING THE 
GREEN I AM SURPRISED 
IF HE CAN MOVE THE RED BUT IS JUST 
BELOW THE BLACK IT WOULD BECOME 
AVAILABLE INTO BOTH CORNER POCKETS CAN HE HOLD FOR THE BLACK HERE A GOOD CHANCE NOW 
HE MAY HAVE TO PLAY FOR THE RED 
ALONG THE TOP CUSHION HERE DOES 
NOT APPEAR TO HAVE THE ANGLE ON THE 
BLACK TO PLAY FOR THE REDS IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE TABLE 
HE IS NOT HAPPY WITH THAT NOT 
BECAUSE HE MISSED IT BUT BECAUSE 
HE FEELS HE GOT A KICK OR IT DID 
NOT PULL BACK IN THE CHANCE HAS 
GONE 
I SAID IT WAS A GOOD CHANCE IF HE 
PLAYED A GOOD POSITIONAL SHOTS 
EARLY ON AND THE VISIT AND HE DID 
THAT NOT 
FOR THE 
FIRST TIME 
WE 
HAVE 
SEEN THE 
BLACK MIST 
OF THE 
SPORT IN 
THE MAIN 
IT HAS BEEN FROM 
MICHAEL JUDGE IT IS A DANGEROUS 
THING TO DO IT CAN COST YOU THE 
FRAME AS 
EASY AS 
ANYTHING BECAUSE 
WHEN 
YOU MISS 
THE BLACK 
OFF THE 
SPOT YOU 
ARE LEAVING 
YOUR OPPONENT 
IN AMONGST 
THE REDS HAVING SAID 
THAT THAT IS A POOR POSITIONAL 
SHOT IT IS IMPERATIVE WITH 
THE WAY ARE YOU 
TRY TO 
STAY IN 
AND AROUND 
THE BLACK UNLESS HE 
PLAYS THE RED ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE 
OF THE 
TABLE TO 
THE FAR 
RIGHT 
CORNER 
HE WILL 
HAVE TO GO FOR A 
BAULK COLOUR 
THAT IS WELL PLAYED HE LEFT 
HIMSELF NICE ANGLE ON THE GREEN 
HE NEEDS TO GET ON TO THE BLACK OR 
GET THE PINK INTO PLAY ONCE AGAIN 
HE HAS DRIFTED OUT OF POSITION 
THAT IS THE PROBLEM WHEN THE CUE 
BALL PAST TO TRAVEL DISTANCES LIKE 
GOING UP FOR THE GREEN HE FINISHED 
PERFECTLY THEN HE HAD TO JUDGE THE 
DISTANCE BACK TO THE REDS HE HAS 
NOT REALLY BEEN THAT STRONG IN THE 
BREAK BUILDING HE HAS ONLY MADE 
ONE BREAK REALLY THAT WAS IN THE 
FIRST FRAME A BREAK OF THIRTY FOUR HE IS 
MAKING HARD WORK HAVE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY OF THIS OPPORTUNITY 
IT DOESN'T GET EASIER HE HAD TO PLAY A DEFT LITTLE TOUCHED SHOT 
THAT IS O. K. 
HE IS HAVING A LOOK AT THAT RED HE FINISHED IN BETWEEN THE PINK AND BLACK 
I THOUGHT HE ONLY HAD TO RUN BLACK THROUGH AND MAKE A CONTACT WITH THE 
SECOND RED BUT HE MADE CERTAIN HE 
HAD THE SECOND CONTACT BY PLAYING A 
STUN SHOT HE COULD BE BETTER ON 
THIS BLACK PLAYED IT WELL THOUGH 
NINE POINTS BEHIND THIS IS AN 
EXCELLENT CHANCE HE WILL BE VERY 
DISAPPOINTED IF HE DOESN'T FINISH 
THE FRAME AT THIS VISIT 
THESE THREE REDS IN THE OPEN AND 
THE BAULK COLOURS WOULD BE MORE 
THAN ENOUGH 
HE DIDN'T GET INTO THAT HE IS O. K. 
ON THE PINK BUT HE NEEDS TO GET 
BIT MORE BACKSPIN ON IT THESE ARE 
THE FRAMES YOU HAVE JUST GOT TO WIN 
BECAUSE MICHAEL JUDGE WILL BE 
SITTING IN HIS CHAIR AND RYAN DAY 
WHO HAS JUST KNOCKED AND NINETY SIX IN THE 
PREVIOUS FRAME HE IS EXPECTING TO 
LOSE THE FRAME AND WE'LL DO WITH 
THAT SHOT IT IS JUST NOT HAPPENING 
HE WILL DO 
IF HE PLAYS FOR THE YELLOW HE WILL 
NEED THE AWKWARD BLUE 
HE WILL BE JUST ALL RIGHT WITH THE 
YELLOW GREEN AND BROWN 
BUT ONCE AGAIN HE HAD HIS CHANCES 
EARLY ON RYAN DIDN'T MAKE THE 
MOST OF IT BUT MICHAEL JUDGE IS 
NOT PUNISHING HIS MISTAKES HE IS 
GETTING ANOTHER CHANCE JUST THE 
BROWN NEEDED TO GO NINETEEN POINTS AHEAD 
WITH ONLY EIGHTEEN REMAINING WELL PLAYED 
MICHAEL JUDGE STAYS IN HIS CHAIR A 
FEW CHANCES FOR BOTH PLAYERS 
BUT IT WAS RYAN DAY WHO OPENS UP A 
TWO FRAME GAP 
THIS IS NOT HIS FAVOURITE POCKET OF 
THE BLACK THAT IS BETTER MICHAEL MISSED TWO OF THOSE EARLY ON 
A CLEAR MIND IS NEEDED HERE THE 
BALLS ARE WELL SET IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO CLEAR YOUR MIND WHEN YOU HAVE 
GOT DOUBTS IN THERE WITH THE ERRORS 
THAT HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE YELLOW 
MIGHT BE THE BETTER COLOUR TO PLAY 
BUT HE WAS ABLE TO COME DOWN THE 
RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE 
HE IS 
INCH PERFECT 
ON THE 
RED HE CAN 
PLAY FOR THE BLACK 
IF HE CAN KEEP THE BREAK GOING AT 
LEAST THE BLACK IS AVAILABLE SO IT 
MAKES IT LITTLE BIT EASIER IT IS HARD OUT THERE 
DISAPPOINTED THERE THE SESSION HAS 
FINISHED ON 
THE OTHER SIDE OF WALL SO GOES UP 
AND NOW 
THEY HAVE GOT THE ARENA TO 
THEMSELVES NO DISTRACTIONS I I WOULDN'T SAY THAT JOHN L. HAVE 
BEEN OUT THERE SOMETIMES WHEN THE 
SCREEN COMES UP IT CAN HAVE QUITE 
AN EFFECT ON YOU IT IS LIKE 
PLAYING IN YOUR FRONT ROOM THEY 
BRING THAT UP AND THEN IT IS LIKE 
PLAYING IN A FIELD 
ON THE 
OTHER 
HAND IT CAN INSPIRE YOU WHICH 
MICHAEL JUDGE NEEDS AT THE MOMENT MICHAEL JUDGE HAS GOT A VERY 
UNUSUAL APPROACH TO THE TABLE AS 
HE WALKS IN HE PUTS HIS CUE ON THE 
LINE OF THE SHOT THEN HE WALKS IN 
IT SEEMS TO WORK FOR HIM HE HAS 
ALWAYS DONE THAT IT 
IS NOT 
TO 
CHANGE HE HAS MADE I DON'T YOU SEE THE 
CUE BEING 
LAID 
DOWN ON 
THE LINE 
OF THE 
SHOT 
AND HE 
WRAPS 
HIS BODY AROUND IT FORTY POINTS THE LEAD 
HE IS JUST LOOKING FOR A RED AND A 
COLOUR NOW THE RED ISN'T CERTAINTY AND TO GET POSITION ON 
THE BLACK 
HE HAS GOT TO INJECT SOME 
THE BLACK HE HAS GOT TO INJECT SOME PACE 
WELL DONE BECAUSE HE WAS UNDER A 
LOT OF PRESSURE THEN HE WAS ON TWO 
OF THE REDS AND THEY WERE BOTH 
TRICKY A LONG THAT CUSHION 
ESPECIALLY 
WHEN IT 
IS THE 
RED THAT 
CAN WIN 
YOU THE 
FRAME SHOULD GET 
THIS BLACK 
NO HEROICS HE KNEW THAT WAS THE FRAME BALL 
IT WAS AN IMPORTANT FRAME THERE 
WERE SIGNS THAT RYAN DAY COULD OPEN 
A BIG GAP BUT ALL THINGS EQUAL THAT WILL REDUCE HIS ARREARS 
FROM FOUR FRAMES TO THREE 
HE HAS POTTED THE RED BUT IF HE 
DOESN'T POT A COLOUR I THINK HE 
WILL CONCEDE THIS FRAME IT WAS A GOOD POT TWO SNOOKERS REQUIRED 
OF COURSE HE COULD GIVE SEVEN 
POINTS THE WAY AWAY IT WOULD 
GIVE HIM A BETTER CHANCE CERTAINLY 
WORTH CARRYING ON FOR RYAN DAY 
HE'S SECOND FAVOURITE AT THE MOMENT 
BUT IT CAN SOON TURN ROUND 
RYAN DAY REQUIRED A SNOOKER IN THE 
FOURTH FRAME THAT WAS JUST PINK AND 
BLACK BUT HE GOT IT 
I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY HE 
SLIGHTLY OVERHIT THAT 
HE MIGHT HAVE OVERHIT THE LAST ONE 
HE HAS GOT TO HIT THIS ONE BY THE 
WAY IT IS RYAN DAY WHO NEEDS THE 
SNOOKERS AM SURE HE WILL GIVE 
THE NOD TO MICHAEL HE HASN'T BUT 
THERE IS CODE OF CONDUCT ISN'T 
THERE TERRY SAYING YOU SHOULD NOT 
CONCEDE WHEN IT IS YOUR OPPONENTS 
TURNED NOW HE CAN'T CAN CONCEDE 
AND HE HAS JUDGE IS JUST ONE 
BEHIND NOW 
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN COUNT HOW MANY 
BALLS MOVE HERE JOHN SEE HOW GOOD 
WE ARE 
I WILL GO FOR FIVE TOO TOO MANY MORE IMPORTANTLY THE PLANT 
DIDN'T GO IN IT WAS MISSABLE ONLY 
BECAUSE OF THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO 
REDS 
THIS FRAME HAS GONE A LITTLE BIT 
AWKWARD FOR BOTH PLAYERS AGAIN HAVING TO FORCE THE CUE BALL 
OUT FOR THE PINK MADE THAT POT A 
LOT MORE DIFFICULT IN THOSE 
SITUATIONS MICHAEL JUDGE WOULD 
SITUATIONS MICHAEL JUDGE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED FROM HERE TO HAVE AN 
EASY POT AS RYAN DAY WOULD HAVE 
WHEN MICHAEL JUDGE MISSED THE PLANT 
THAT IS JUST HOW SOME FRAMES GO 
SOMETIMES YES IT IS TURNING INTO A VERY 
SCRAPPY FRAME BUT STILL A VERY 
IMPORTANT ONE AS YOU SAID 
YESTERDAY TERRY EVERY SHOT IS 
YESTERDAY TERRY EVERY SHOT IS 
IMPORTANT IF 
YOU CAN WIN SOME OF 
THE SCRAPPY FRAMES YOU GET MORE 
SATISFACTION OUT OF THEM THEN IF 
YOU CLEAR UP WITH A FRAME WINNING 
BREAK IN THE SCRAPPY ONES 
IT MEANS 
YOU 
HAVE MADE 
A 
FEW MISTAKES 
AND 
GOT AWAY WITH IT 
JUST AS IMPORTANT 
YOUR OPPONENT HAS MADE A FEW 
MISTAKES AND HAS NOT WON THE FRAME 
PART OF THE BLAME HERE WOULD BE THE 
WAY THE BALLS ARE SET BUT YOU 
WOULD SAY ALSO THAT BOTH PLAYERS 
ARE MISSING CHANCES 
YOU ARE NOT 
SUGGESTING IT IS THE REFEREE'S 
FAULT FOR SETTING 
THE BALLS 
UP 
WRONG ARE YOU TERRY 
I HAVE NEVER 
HEARD YOU DEFENDING REFEREES BEFORE 
JOHN ARE YOU TURNING OVER A NEW 
LEAF NO NO SORRY 
THE PROBLEM HERE IS HE HAS AN ACUTE 
ANGLE 
HE WILL BE UNLUCKY IF HE NESTLES ON 
THIS RED UNLUCKY HE WILL MOST 
CALLED THAT BEFORE IT HAPPENED 
JOHN YOU COULD SEE IT HAPPENING 
HE HAS HAD A LOOK AT THE GREEN BUT 
HE WILL BE TAKING THAT ON 
FRUSTRATION AFTER WHAT THERE ON 
THE OTHER 
HAND 
HE HASN'T 
REALLY GOT A GOOD SAFETY HE CAN 
PLAY I'M NOT SURE ABOUT BROWN HE 
IS BRIDGING OVER THE RED AND CAN 
ONLY SEE HALF OF THE BROWN YELLOW NOW HE IS GOING FOR ANOTHER YELLOW 
NOT BAD HE PLAYED TO SLIP BEHIND 
THE BROWN BUT IT IS O. K. AS WE 
MENTIONED THE PREVIOUS FRAME 
HALFWAY THROUGH AT THE MOMENT HERE 
AFTER FIFTEEN MINUTES IT IS ELEVEN FOUR 
MICHAEL JUDGE 
HE WAS IN TROUBLE HE HAS DONE O. K. 
THERE THINK SHE DID GO FOR THE 
RED KNOWING THAT HE WOULD 
LEAVE ANOTHER RED ON SHOULD HE 
MISS 
AS WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY TIMES IN 
THE PAST IT IS BECOMING BATTLE 
OF MINDS IN THE CRUCIBLE WHO CAN 
CLEAR THEIR MIND QUICKLY ENOUGH TO 
PLAY 
THE SORT 
OF SNOOKER WE EXPECT 
FROM THE 
TOP PLAYERS LIKE THESE 
TWO ARE 
THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE SO FAR 
FOUL AND A MISS 
HE JUST CAUGHT THE YELLOW ON THE 
WAY THROUGH THERE RYAN COULD PUT 
IT BACK ASK HIM TO PLAY AGAIN 
THE ONLY DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY IN 
THIS SHOT IS THAT THE CUE BALL IS 
CLOSE TO THE BAULK CUSHION 
WE WERE TALKING YESTERDAY ABOUT THE 
NEW MISS RULE THAT STOPS PLAYERS 
CHEATING ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE 
MICHAEL JUDGE TELLING THE REFEREE 
TO TAKE 
IT FURTHER 
OVER WHICH 
IS A 
DISADVANTAGE 
TO HIM 
ALL OF THE 
PLAYERS ARE VERY FAIR WITH 
MISS RULE THEY GET 
SOMETIMES FOR BEING FAIR I THINK 
YES IT ALWAYS AMAZES ME THAT THE 
REFEREES ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO THE 
PLAYER L. DON'T KNOW WHY SOMETIMES THEY DON'T 
LEAVE IT 
TO 
THE PLAYER 
TO REPLACE THE BALL 
IF YOU 
TOUCH 
TO REPLACE THE BALL IF YOU TOUCH THE CUE 
BALL OF 
COURSE IT IS A 
FOUL THE BALL IS STILL IN PLAY 
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT WITH RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN COUPLE OF SEASONS AGO THE REFEREE WAS 
CALLING A 
MISS AS 
SOON AS 
HE 
CALLED IT 
HE 
KNEW THE 
PLAY 
WAS NOT 
COMING BACK 
TO THE 
TABLE 
HE PICKED 
THE 
WHITE UP 
AND 
GIVE IT 
TO THE 
REFEREE THE 
REFEREE 
SAID IF 
YOU 
DO THAT 
ONCE 
MORE YOU 
WILL HAVE CONCEDED THE FRAME VERY 
PEDANTIC SOMETIMES 
DID HE PICK THE 
WHY TOP AGAIN NO I THINK HE WENT 
NO I THINK HE WENT AND SAT DOWN 
WHAT ABOUT THIS SHOT 
THERE YOU GO THAT WAS AS GOOD 
SHOT AS WE HAVE SEEN THIS MORNING 
ABSOLUTELY INCH PERFECT THE LINE 
AND OF COURSE THE WEIGHT 
THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS TO GET THE 
CUE BALL TO COME BACK TO THIS OF THE 
TABLE THE 
MOST IMPORTANT 
THING FOR 
MICHAEL 
IS TO 
GET 
IT SAFE 
IT 
WILL BE 
VERY DIFFICULT 
TO DO 
THAT 
ALL OF 
THE 
REDS HAVE 
CONGREGATED 
ON THE 
LEFT HAND SIDE 
OF THE 
TABLE 
AS WE 
LOOK 
AND TO 
HIT 
A RED 
AND GET IT SAFE IS ALMOST 
A RED AND GET IT SAFE IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT 
ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS YOU CAN 
GET INTO A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHEN 
YOU CAN PLAY IT 
WHAT WE 
CALL HIT 
AND HOPE SHOT BUT HE CANNOT JUST 
COME OFF ONE CUSHION 
HE CAN LOOK AT REDS HE WOULD LIKE 
TO HIT BUT HOW HE CAN JUDGE IT 
PERFECTLY IS ASKING A LOT 
WELL PLAYED 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS SAFE 
OR NOT BUT HE MAY HAVE HAD RESULT RESULT HE PLAYED FOR THE RED TO THE LEFT 
ON THE LEFT CUSHION BUT IT IS 
STILL A GOOD SHOT 
YOU ARE BEING A 
BIT EXACT TERRY NO HE CAME DOWN 
NO HE CAME DOWN TO LOOK AT IT AS IT TURNS OUT 
ALMOST GOT THEM ALL SAFE 
YES WAS A 
GOOD THOUGHT 
TO 
PLAY IN 
AND 
OUT 
OF THE 
JAWS 
OF THE 
POCKET 
HAS DONE REALLY WELL TO GET IT SAFE 
IN 
A WAY 
IT 
COULD HAVE 
BEEN A 
MORE COSTLY BECAUSE IT WAS A 
DIFFICULT SNOOKER 
WHAT ABOUT SEVENTY POINTS IN FOULS YOU MEAN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
A AFTER LONG SAFETY BATED IS EASY 
YOUR RHYTHM STRAIGHT 
AWAY BUT HE DOES NOT HELP IF YOU 
GET A BAD CONTACT ON THE BLACK 
IT DOES NOT HELP 
AND ANOTHER KICK IT IS ALL GOING 
ON OUT THERE 
IT LOOKED A HEAVY 
CONTACT AND YET THERE WAS NO 
REACTION FROM RYAN DAY 
JUST A BOAT ON THE YELLOW BUT HE 
DOES NOT WANT TO BE TOO STRAIGHT ON 
IT JUST A BOAT 
HE HAS COME VERY STRAIGHT ON THIS 
RED 
HE PINCHED A LITTLE BIT BUT DID NOT 
CONTROL THE CUE BALL AS HE WOULD 
HAVE LIKED 
PLAYING WITH THE REST IT IS NOT SO 
EASY TO IMPART THE SPINS 
A VERY THIN BLACK HERE I'M NOT 
SURE IF IT IS WORTH THE RISK TO TRY 
TO SWIM THE CUE BALL ALL THE WAY 
AROUND THE TABLE 
ANOTHER TOUGH RED TO FOLLOW IF HE 
DECIDES TO GO FOR IT 
GRAVITY NEVER TOOK OVER THERE WITH 
A BIT MORE PACE I THINK IT WOULD 
HAVE CONLIN GONE IN 
THE YELLOW IS THE PROBLEM IT HE 
GOT THE TWO REDS AND COLOURS BUT HE 
HE IS LOOKING FOR THAT HE IS 
LOOKING FOR 
I THINK HE DID PLAY TO KISS THAT 
RED OUT THE TROUBLE IS HE IS NOT 
ON A COLOUR 
AS SOON HAS HE HIT IT HE KNEW IT 
WAS NOT THERE 
THAT IS TWO SHOTS WE 
HAVE SEEN NOW AND WITH THE YELLOW 
SO IT HELPED TO LET THEM MAKE THE 
DECISION TO TAKE THE POT ON 
HE IS NOT TOO HAPPY IN HIS FAVOUR 
THERE WAS BUT HE WAS TRAINED TO BE 
ON THE GREEN SO IT WAS NOT A 
DIFFICULT POSITION WILL SHOT 
POSITIONAL SHOT 
THIS FRAME IS THE LONGER SO FAR IN 
THIS MATCH IN GENERAL THE SPEED 
OF PLAY HAS BEEN VERY GOOD IT IS 
THE STANDARD OF PLAY THAT HAS 
DRAGGED THE FRAME OUT 
I THINK RYAN DAY PLAYED TO CANNON 
INTO THE BROWN AND SNOOKER MICHAEL 
JUDGE BUT AFTER MISSING THE BROWN 
ON THE WAY ACROSS HE WAS LUCKY NOT 
LEAD THE YELLOW ON 
HE HAS PLAYED THAT SHOT AT COUPLE 
OF TIMES ROUND OFF THE CUSHIONS 
THAT COULD DECIDE THE OUTCOME OF 
THIS FRAME HE HAS TO HIT THIS 
BECAUSE OTHERWISE AND THIS WILL BE 
CALLED A MISS WILL BE CALLED 
COULD HIT COULD HIT IT HIS HOPES IN THIS FRAME ALIVE 
A NICE TOUCH THERE FROM BRIAN DAY 
JUST TO STUN THE CUE BALL BEHIND 
THE BLACK RYAN DAY 
IN AN IDEAL WORLD HE WOULD LIKE TO 
CONTACT YELLOW ABOUT HALF BALL ON 
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THAT IS NOT 
WHAT HE WANTED BUT IF THERE IS 
THERE ANGLE FOR RYAN DAY IT COULD 
BE O. K. 
IF THE CUE BALL HAD BEEN AN INCH 
FURTHER DOWN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN 
EASY CHOICE 
THERE IS LOTS OF THINGS THAT CAN GO 
WRONG WITH SHOT LIKE THIS IT 
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE HE HAS AN ANGLE 
TO COME ROUND THE BACK OF THE BLACK 
HOW DOES HE POT LEE CREAMY AND KEPT 
ON THE BROWN POT THE GREEN AND 
INCREDIBLE HE DID NOT EVEN GET 
CLOSE TO POTTING THAT GREEN HE WAS 
LUCKY TO GO IN OFF BUT LOOK HOW 
MUCH HE MISSED THE GREEN FIVE 
THE GAME IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT 
BOGGED DOWN NOW HIS HE TRIED TO 
FORCE THE ISSUE THINKING HE SHOULD 
BE DOING BETTER 
I THINK RYAN DAY 
IS VERY POSITIVE ANY WAY IN HIS 
SHOT SELECTION ANYBODY WHO IS 
POSITIVE IS GOING TO SLIP OVER THE 
EDGE SOMETIMES A BE A LITTLE BIT 
TOO AGGRESSIVE 
THE THIS IS BY I'LL LONGEST FRAME 
OF THE MOST SO FAR IT MICHAEL 
JUDGE COULD POT THIS GREEN YOU 
WOULD WAITING FOR GOOD FOR THE FRAME MAKE HIM FAVOURITE 
NOT JUST A GOOD POT BUT AN 
EXCELLENT POSITIONAL SHOT FOR THE 
BROWN 
THIS GAME IS SEEKING MICHAEL CHURCH 
AT THE MOMENT IF IT WAS 
BUILDING I THINK YOU WOULD FANCY 
RYAN DAY MOVING IN FRONT AND HE 
HAS LEVELLED IT UP TWO FRAMES ON 
THE TROT FOR MICHAEL JUDGE 
RYAN DAY GETS FRAME NINE UNDER WAY 
DE LAST IN THIS FIRST SESSION IN 
MOST OTHER TOURNAMENTS WINNER BE 
LOOKING AT THE DECIDING FRAME HERE 
BUT NOT AT THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
NINETEEN FRAMES IN THE FIRST ROUND AND IN 
THE SECOND ROUND IT BOOST TO THE 
BEST OF TWENTY FIVE HE WILL HAVE THE LEAD 
GOING INTO THE NEXT SESSION THE 
LAST FRAME WAS JUST OVER FORTY MINUTES 
I DO NOT THINK HE HAS GOT AN ANGLE 
ON DEPLETED JUST DROP ON THE LOOSE 
RED SO I THINK HE WILL CANNON INTO 
THE PINK 
HE DOES NOT LOOK HAPPY HE IS ON 
THE PINK BUT IT IS THE ANGLE HE 
HAS GOT 
HE HAD TO PLAY WITH PACE FOUR 
STRAIGHTER ROADS TO FORCE 
THROUGH THE REDS 
I THINK THERE ARE REDS AVAILABLE TO 
BIRDS MIDDLE POCKET BOTH MIDDLE 
POCKET 
WE HAVE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO TALK 
ABOUT THE MISTAKES OF EACH PLAYER 
SO I SUPPOSE FROM A POINT OF VIEW 
WHERE UP UNTIL THIS FRAME MICHAEL 
JUDGE'S HIGHEST BREAK HAS ONLY BEEN 
THIRTY SEVEN HE WOULD BE OVER THE MOON IF HE 
COULD TAKE A LEAD INTO THE SECOND 
SESSION 
RYAN DAY WAS HER THE FAVOURITE AT 
THE START OF THE MATCH BUT THESE 
TOP SEEDS ARE ALWAYS UNDER PRESSURE 
ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST ROUND HE 
HAS NOT READY SHOWN THE FORM 
DOHERTY HAS SHOWN DURING THE SEASON 
THAT HE HAS SHOWN 
HE GAVE IT SO MUCH THOUGHT AND 
FORGOT ABOUT THE RED HE IS 
CONCENTRATING THAT MUCH ON THE 
POSITIONAL SIDE OF THE SHOT THAT HE 
FORGOT THE POT 
AT LEAST HE GOT HIS HIGHEST BREAK 
SO FAR 
I DO NOT THINK HE WILL LOOK 
ON BUT AS A HIGH SPOT NOT IF HE 
LOSES THIS FRAME AFTER GIFTING THIS 
CHANCE TO HIS OPPONENT 
NO REDS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE RIGHT 
CORNER SO HE WILL HAVE TO FIND WAY INTO ONE ON THE LEFT 
HE HAS BLUE AND PINK BUT IT WILL 
TAKE GOOD SHOT HERE TO KEEP IT GOING 
HE DID NOT GET THE NECESSARY SPENT 
ON SO THE CUE BALL HAS NOT COME 
CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE BLACK AND IT 
HAS GONE TOO FAR AWAY UP THE TABLE 
HE WAS FORCED INTO IT BUT 
SOMETIMES IT TAKES ANY TAKE AWAY 
FROM YOUR MIND YOU HAVE TO FULLY 
COMMIT 
AS IT TURNED OUT HE HAD COMMIT THE PERFECT ANGLE TO KNOCK THE 
BLACK IN AND GET THE CANNON 
THAT UNBELIEVABLE MISSED FROM 
MICHAEL JUDGE WHICH SUMS UP THE 
MATCH SO FAR WITH UNFORCED ERRORS 
YELLOW AND GREEN IS WHAT IS 
REQUIRED 
THE FIRST FOUR FRAMES IT WAS O. K. 
BUT THEN IT WENT A LITTLE BIT 
SCRAPPY BOTH PLAYERS COULD NOT 
FIND THE BEST FORM THAT AFFECTS 
THEIR MIND SOMETIMES L. DO NOT 
THINK RYAN DAY WILL BE THAT PLEASED 
WITH HIS PERFORMANCE L. THINK WE 
WILL SEE THE HAND SHAKE THAT 
SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO ENSURE THAT 
RYAN DAY IS INTO THE NEXT SESSION 
ONE FRAME IN FRONT THAT IS A DO 
A GOOD COME BACK FROM RYAN DAY TO 
SEE THE CONCLUDING FRAMES OF THAT 
MUCH PRESTON RED BUT AND LATER ON 
THIS MORNING
