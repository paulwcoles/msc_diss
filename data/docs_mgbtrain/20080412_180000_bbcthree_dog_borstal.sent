HE JUST DRIVES ME INSANE ABSOLUTELY MAKES ME GO CRAZY 
BRUNO AND BUDDY ARE THE KRAY TWINS OF THE DOG WORLD 
SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT I REALLY HATE BRUNO AND BUDDY SO MUCH THAT I WANT THEM OUT THE HOUSE I WANT THEM GONE 
THE OWNERS OF THESE DOGS ARE AT BREAKING POINT 
IT'S TIME FOR EXTREME MEASURES 
THIS IS THE LAST RESORT FOR BAD DOGS 
SET UP ON A SECURE TEN ACRE COMPOUND IN A REMOTE PART OF THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
DOG BORSTAL IS RUN BY THREE OF BRITAIN'S TOUGHEST TRAINERS 
IT'S NOT THE SIZE OF THE DOG IT'S THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM 
EACH TRAINER WILL TAKE ON ONE DOG AND ATTEMPT TO REFORM THEM IN JUST FOUR DAYS 
USING THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL TRAINING METHODS 
MY MISSION IS TO TEACH OWNERS TO TEACH DOGS WHO'S BOSS 
BUT TO REFORM BAD DOGS THEY NEED TO TACKLE THEIR OWNERS 
FOR THESE DOGS THEIR FREEDOM TO BEHAVE BADLY IS COMING TO AN END 
THE FIRST CANINE DELINQUENT BOUND FOR BORSTAL IS THREE YEAR OLD CHIHUAHUA HARVEY 
CHIHUAHUA 
HE'S TINY HE DOESN'T EVEN WEIGH THREE POUNDS HE'S NOT A DOG 
AT HOME IN GLOUCESTER TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD OWNER DANIELLE DOTES ON NINE INCH HIGH DOE EYED HARVEY 
GOOD BOY HE SNACKS ON HIS FAVOURITE FOODS 
TAKES HUSBAND RANDY'S PLACE ON THE SOFA 
AND GETS CHAUFFEURED AROUND TOWN IN DESIGNER OUTFITS 
HE'S MY LITTLE BOY I LOVE HIM 
BUT THIS SEEMINGLY INNOCENT CREATURE IS NO BAMBI 
OH 
MOST FRIGHTENING IS THE WAY HE RESPONDS TO CHILDREN AND ANIMALS 
THAT REALLY MAKES ME NERVOUS 
DESPITE WEIGHING NO MORE THAN A CHRISTMAS PUDDING 
HARVEY WILL FEROCIOUSLY ATTACK ANY DOG THAT DARES TO CROSS HIS PATH 
THE DOG DOESN'T HAVE ANY RESPECT FO R. ME 
I THINK IT HAS PRETTY MUCH GONE TOO FAR GET DOWN 
BUT TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR SPOILT LITTLE PRINCE HARVEY 
HE'S ABOUT TO BE BROUGHT DOWN TO SIZE AT DOG BORSTAL 
HARVEY'S PERSONAL TRAINER FOR THE WEEK IS MIC MARTIN 
MIC'S METHODS PERFECTED THROUGH TWENTY YEARS OF TRAINING MILITARY AND POLICE DOGS 
ARE NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED 
A STICKLER FOR DISCIPLINE MIC WON'T TOLERATE SLACKNESS FROM EITHER DOG OR OWNER 
UNFORTUNATELY FOR DANIELLE MIC'S IDEA OF A SOFTLY SOFTLY APPROACH 
IS ONE HUNDRED PRESS UPS BEFORE DAWN 
JUST POP HIM ON THE LEAD YEP JUST TURN YOUR ENGINE OFF PLEASE 
HE'S SHOWN HIS NEW HOME FOR THE WEEK 
EVERY TIME YOU GET TO THIS DOOR YOU PUT YOUR FOOT UP TO THE DOOR AND SHOUT DOG IN 
DOG IN 
THE NEXT CANINE YOBS ARE BEING DRIVEN INTO BORSTAL 
THIS TIME IT'S DOUBLE TROUBLE 
AT HOME IN CHELTENHAM STAFFORDSHIRE BULL TERRIER CROSSES 
BRUNO AND BUDDY ARE DESTROYING THEIR OWNER'S FAMILY LIFE 
WHAT'S THIS 
THEY GET ME SO WOUND UP I FEEL HELPLESS IN MY OWN HOME 
UPSTAIRS ANGE'S HOUSE IS A HAVEN OF TASTE AND TRANQUILLITY 
BUT DOWNSTAIRS 
THESE CANINE DUSTBINS ARE CHEWING AND TOILETING IN EVERY ROOM ON A DAILY BASIS 
I COME HOME FROM WORK I STOP AT THE FRONT DOOR 
AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME MESS THE OTHER SIDE 
WHAT'S THIS CRYING EVERY TIME I WENT THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR 
WHAT'S THIS WHAT HAVE YOU DONE 
HE PEED IN MY ROOM AND DID A POO 
BRUNO AND BUDDY ARE A TWO DOG EATING MACHINE AND IT'S NOT JUST TASTY TREATS THEY'RE AFTER 
I'VE ACTUALLY PULLED A PIECE OF LEATHER OUT OF HIM 
IT WAS EIGHT INCHES WE MEASURED IT 
THEY PULLED THE DOOR OUT BROKE THE DRAWER OFF CHEWED EVERYTHING INSIDE IT 
STUFFED FULL OF RUBBISH AND PENT UP ENERGY 
BRUNO AND BUDDY EASILY OVERPOWER ANGE 
STEADY 
I HATE WALKING THE DOGS 
I ACTUALLY HATE IT TO THE POINT WHERE I REFUSE TO WALK THEM 
HUSBAND MARK HOWEVER ENJOYS A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH BRUNO AND BUDDY 
PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH OF A PROBLEM WITH THE DOGS I'M HAPPY WITH THE WAY THEY ARE 
I LOVE THE WAY THEY PLAY AROUND AND FIGHT AROUND 
THEY'RE MY MATES THEY'RE MY BOYS 
BUT IF BRUNO AND BUDDY DON'T CHANGE THEIR WAYS 
IT'S NOT ONLY THE HOUSE THAT COULD END UP IN TATTERS 
THEY'RE CAUSING A LOT OF PROBLEMS BETWEEN ME AND HERSELF 
I WANT TO KEEP THEM SHE WANTS TO GET RID OF THEM 
I DON'T THINK MARK FULLY APPRECIATES HOW IT GETS ME DOWN 
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP EVERY DAY 
HE DOESN'T COME HOME TO IT AND OPEN THE DOOR TO IT 
I HOPE THEY'RE SICK 
BRUNO AND BUDDY NEED TO BE STOPPED 
THEY'RE BEING SENT DOWN TO DOG BORSTAL 
THEIR TRAINER FOR THE WEEK IS ROBERT ALLEYNE 
HE SPECIALISES IN DOG BEHAVIOUR 
HELPING OWNERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES THEIR DOGS TICK 
WITH BRUNO AND BUDDY LOCKED UP OUT OF HARM'S WAY 
ROBERT NOW WANTS TO GET STRAIGHT TO THE HEART OF THIS COUPLE'S PROBLEMS 
FOR ME ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS TO FIND WAYS THAT YOU CAN WORK TOGETHER 
HE DOESN'T APPRECIATE WHAT I'VE GONE THROUGH EMOTIONALLY AS WELL 
AND THEN HE COMES HOME HELLO BOYS 
NO THEY'VE BEEN REALLY NAUGHTY 
YOU'VE GOT TO SAY HELLO TO THEM OBVIOUSLY 
I'VE JUST COME THROUGH THE DOOR YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ME WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU THINK 
DOGS THE BOYS 
THE FIRST PERSON YOU SHOULD SAY HELLO TO SHOULD BE YOUR PARTNER 
AND SLASH OR YOUR CHILD THE DOGS NEED TO KNOW THEY COME BELOW IN THAT PECKING ORDER 
I CAN'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH IT 
AT BORSTAL DOGS COME FIRST OWNERS SECOND 
WHICH MEANS BASIC ACCOMMODATION FOR THE HUMAN INMATES 
OH GOD WOW LUXURY ABSOLUTE LUXURY 
HARVEY'S WORRIED OWNER IS FINDING THE FIRST FEW HOURS OF BORSTAL A REAL CHALLENGE 
I REALLY WASN'T HAPPY ABOUT LEAVING HIM COS HE'S FRIGHTENED TO DEATH 
MIC THE MILITARY MAN IS SCARY AS HELL 
SCARY AS HELL 
I CAN'T SEE THAT I'M GOING TO GET ANY FAVOURS COS I'VE GOT A CHIHUAHUA 
AND I THINK HE'S A BIG DOG MAN 
HARVEY AND BRUNO AND BUDDY HAVE ALL OVERSTEPPED THE MARK 
BUT CAN THEY BE REFORMED IN LESS THAN A WEEK 
BRUNO AND BUDDY'S DESTRUCTION IS DRIVING OWNERS MARK AND ANGE APART 
THERE'S NO WAY THAT HE CAN FULLY APPRECIATE HOW IT MAKES ME FEEL 
WILL ROBERT BE ABLE TO SORT THESE DOGS OUT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE 
SHE IS REALLY UPSET BY THESE DOGS 
AND HE'S GOT TO HELP HER TO PROGRESS 
OTHERWISE SHE'LL GET NOWHERE 
HARVEY'S A TINY DOG WITH A HUGE CRIMINAL RECORD 
HE REALLY DOES GET NASTY 
BUT WILL TOUGH MAN MIC BE WILLING TO TAKE ON A CHIHUAHUA HE DOESN'T THINK WORTHY OF LICKING HIS BOOTS 
IF I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THEM 
GOODBYE I DON'T TRAIN THEM 
IT'S GOING TO BE A DEMANDING WEEK 
WILL EVERYONE MAKE IT TO THE END 
MIC HAS SPENT A RESTLESS NIGHT THINKING ABOUT HIS NEW PUPIL 
I CAN'T SEE WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT 
IT'S JUST A LITTLE UGLY DOG AND THAT'S IT 
THAT IS AN UGLY DOG I'M TELLING YOU NOW 
I THINK I'M ONE STEP AWAY FROM JUST LOSING THE PLOT 
YOU CAN'T USE A COLLAR IT'S GOT THIS LITTLE SHIRT THING WITH A CLIP ON IT AND YOUR LEAD 
IT'S NOT GOING TO DO SPORT 
IT'S JUST WEAK LOOKING 
I THINK IT'S JUST GOING TO DIE WITH ME YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO A SWAP AREN'T YOU WE'LL DO IT THEN 
ER GUYS HIYA 
GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS GO ON 
YOU'VE GOT ME NOW AH HA I KNEW IT TWO HOURS TOO MUCH FOR YOU 
I CAN'T HANDLE IT AND I THINK YOU TWO CAN TAKE ANY BOLLOCKS I THROW AT YOU 
MARK IS FLATTERED TO BE HAND PICKED BY ACTION MAN MIC 
DANIELLE IS ABOUT TO FIND OUT SHE'S BEEN DUMPED 
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL BUT WE'RE GOING TO SWAP TRAINERS 
IT WAS LOVELY WORKING WITH YOU 
BUT YOU ARE VULGAR YOU ARE A VULGAR MAN 
HERE'S YOUR BOOK OH YES YES 
WE NEED TO DO SWAPS 
HA HA YOU'VE GOT HIM FOR THE WEEK 
ROBERT WANTS TO GET STRAIGHT TO THE HEART OF HARVEY'S PROBLEM 
I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP 
I THINK SHE HAS PUT THIS DOG IN A POSITION NOW WHERE HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO BE A DOG ANY MORE 
WHEN YOU TAKE AN ANIMAL AND TRY AND TURN IT INTO A FASHION ACCESSORY 
FOR THE ANIMAL THE ONLY WAY IS DOWN 
IT'S A BIT SADDENING FOR ME TO SEE A DOG THAT ENDS UP LIKE THAT 
BUT I THINK DANIELLE WILL DO HER UTMOST TO PUT IT RIGHT 
ROBERT NEEDS TO SHOW DANIELLE WHAT PAMPERING HAS DONE TO HARVEY 
OFTEN THE PEOPLE WHO GET DOGS LIKE HIM WILL GET THOSE DOGS SO THEY CAN DO EVERYTHING FOR THEM 
THE DOG KIND OF LOSES ITS ABILITY TO DO THINGS FOR ITSELF 
TO PROVE HIS POINT HE'S DEVISED A CHIHUAHUA STYLE I. Q. TEST 
JUST TAKE HIS FOOD PUT IT ON THE BLACK LINE ON THE FLOOR 
PLACE THE CUP OVER IT O. K. 
I'LL TIME HOW LONG IT TAKES HARVEY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE FOOD 
M. M. M. 
WHAT'S THIS 
YOU REALISE YOUR BREED'S REPUTATION IS SLIDING DOWN THE TOILET AT THE MOMENT 
IS HIS HAIR NATURALLY THAT COLOUR 
NOT SO GOOD BOY 
HAVING PROVED TO BE NO GENIUS 
ROBERT NEED TO SEE WHAT MAKES HARVEY LOSE HIS HEAD IN PUBLIC 
IN AN EXCEPTION TO BORSTAL RULES 
THIS MINI INMATE IS BEING LET OUT ON DAY RELEASE 
THIS IS HIGHLY HIGHLY EMBARRASSING 
REALLY I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M ABOUT THAT BIG 
O. K. NOT IDEAL 
BACK AT BORSTAL ROBERT IS WORRIED THAT FIXING THIS MIDGET DOG WILL BE A MAMMOTH TASK 
HE'S GOT A FAIR FEW PROBLEMS 
SHE WAS AN ABSOLUTE NERVOUS WRECK 
SHE LET HIM CONTROL SO MUCH OF THE WALK 
WHEN HE WANTS TO STOP SHE STOPS WHEN HE WANTS TO START SHE STARTS 
I THINK THAT'S PART OF HER PROBLEM WHEN HE'S OUT HE JUST DOES WHAT HE LIKES 
IT REALLY BECOMES CLEAR HOW MUCH WORK WE'VE GOT TO DO WITH A DAY AND A BIT CAN WE DO IT UM 
MIC IS PREPARING FOR BUDDY AND BRUNO'S FIRST TRAINING SESSION 
I THINK A LOT OF IT IS DOWN TO BOREDOM 
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE GOING OUT DOING LITTLE OR NO CONSTRUCTIVE EXERCISE 
AND IF THEY COULD GET INTO SOMETHING MORE CONSTRUCTIVE FOR THE DOGS 
THE DOGS WILL USE THEIR BRAIN 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE TIRED AND GO HOME AND NOT CHEW 
MIC HAS DECIDED THAT ANGE SHOULD HANDLE THE BIGGEST DOG BRUNO 
BUT THINGS START OFF BADLY 
KEEP GOING KEEP GOING WAIT WAIT LOOSE DOG 
COME HERE 
LOOSE DOG 
BULLY BOY BRUNO HAS BEEN MAKING ANGE'S LIFE A MISERY 
VANDALISING HER HOUSE AND TERRORISING HER ON THE STREETS 
THEY'RE MARK'S BOYS THEY'RE MY PAIN IN THE BUTTS 
NOW MIC IS FORCING HER TO SQUARE UP TO HER ARCH ENEMY 
FIRST BACK TO BASICS HOW TO USE A LEAD 
YOU STEP OFF BIG STEP LEFT AND THEN YOU JUST GO FOR IT LIKE THIS 
IF YOU NEED TO USE TWO HANDS PUT THE OTHER HAND THERE LIKE THAT 
GO FORWARD HEEL THAT'S IT OFF YOU GO NOW STEP YOUR PACE UP 
SAY HEEL HEEL TEACH HIM THE WORD 
COLLAR LOOSE WATCH WATCH WATCH 
THE NEW RECRUITS ARE ALREADY UNDER MIC'S FIRM COMMAND 
LEFT RIGHT AND STOP 
SIT SIT SAY IT NICELY 
SAY IT LIKE YOUR WIFE GOOD BOY GOOD BOY SIT LIKE THAT 
LIKE A BIG JESSIE MAN SAY IT LIKE THAT SIT 
VERY NICE YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ALL GIRLY ON ME 
IT'S BECOMING CLEAR THAT FOR ONCE ANGE HAS THE UPPER HAND 
UP 
I THOUGHT HE WOULD FLY OVER THAT VERY GOOD VOICE NICE STEP OFF HE'S A LITTLE BIT SLOW 
MIC HAS ALREADY SPOTTED AN OBVIOUS REASON FOR THE DOGS' MISBEHAVIOUR 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S TWO DOGS THERE THAT INTERACT TOGETHER 
THEY PLAY TOGETHER THEY DO THIS TOGETHER WHAT DO THEY NEED THEM TWO FOR 
ONE THING PUTTING FOOD DOWN THAT'S IT 
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED JUST BRING THE FOOD PUT IT THERE AND OFF 
AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY'RE BEING TOLD DO THIS DO THIS 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME WHAT TO DO 
HAVING FAILED TO HANDLE LITTLE BUDDY 
MARK'S EGO HAS TAKEN A BRUISING 
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU 
BECAUSE IN THE KENNEL HE'S JUMPING UP ONTO HIS BED UP THAT HIGH 
THAT MIC'S GOT OVER THERE IT'S LIKE WHAT'S WRONG 
BAD DOGS HARVEY AND BUDDY AND BRUNO ARE SERVING TIME AT BORSTAL 
IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY MUST PASS THE TEST TO PROVE THEY'RE REFORMED 
BUT WILL THEY MAKE THE GRADE 
STOP IT NOW FOR SAKE PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY 
THIS MORNING HARVEY IS GOING TO BE PUSHED TO HIS LIMITS 
ROBERT NEEDS TO STOP HIM PICKING FIGHTS BEFORE IT GETS OUT OF HAND 
YOU'RE GOING TO WALK HARVEY UP AND DOWN ALONG THAT WALL 
I'M GOING TO BRING THE OTHER DOG IN HARVEY NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO COPE WITH THAT 
IF HE MAKES THE SLIGHTEST NOISE I WANT YOU TO RATTLE THAT LOUDLY 
LEAVE ROBERT IS INTRODUCING A NOISE DISTRACTION TECHNIQUE 
USED WHEN REWARDS ALONE DON'T WORK 
HARVEY LEAVE 
LEAVE SHAKE THE BOTTLE HARVEY LEAVE EVERY TIME 
HARVEY LEAVE 
THAT'S RIGHT EVERY TIME HE BARKS YOU TELL HIM TO BE QUIET 
HARVEY LEAVE 
REMEMBER TO REWARD HIM WHEN HE'S DOING THE RIGHT THING LEAVE LEAVE 
WELL DONE JUST WHAT HE NEEDED 
DISTRACTED BY THE SOUND OF THE RATTLE HARVEY LEARNS TO IGNORE THE OTHER DOGS 
GOOD BOY 
BUT ROBERT IS STILL NOT CONVINCED THAT DANIELLE IS HAPPY TO DISCIPLINE HER BELOVED HARVEY 
DANIELLE IS SO CONSCIOUS ALL THE TIME OF HARVEY'S SEEMING FRAILTY 
SHE KIND OF STILL ASKS HIM AND WANTS THE BOTTLE TO DO THE TELLING FOR HER 
I THINK VERY QUICKLY HE WILL BECOME DESENSITISED TO THAT 
SO I'LL HAVE TO WORK ON HER BEING FIRMER WITH HIM 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS PUT OUT SOME OF HARVEY'S BAKED CHICKEN 
HIS FAVOURITE TREAT AND ENCOURAGE HIM TO TRY AND HELP HIMSELF 
IT'S DOWN TO DANIELLE WHETHER OR NOT HE SUCCEEDS 
THIS IS A CHILD O. K. THAT HARVEY WANTS TO BITE 
IT'S DOWN TO YOU WHETHER OR NOT HE BITES THE CHILD 
SPOILT LITTLE HARVEY IS A MENACE AROUND CHILDREN 
A LITTLE TWO OR THREE YEAR OLD COMES UP TO HIM AND HE WILL GO FOR THEM 
WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO IS AVOID HIM BITING THE CHILD RATHER THAN DEAL WITH IT AFTER HE'S BITTEN IT 
HARVEY LEAVE 
LEAVE HARVEY LEAVE 
DANIELLE IS STILL NOT BEING FORCEFUL ENOUGH ROBERT STEPS IN 
WHAT I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO IS GO HARVEY I'LL PULL YOU AWAY SO YOU CAN'T EVEN REACH IT KIND OF LEAVE 
BECAUSE HARVEY IS NOT MAKING THE CHOICE YOU ARE YEAH 
WHAT'LL HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE PULLING HIM AWAY AND THE KID OR DOG IS COMING TOWARDS HIM 
AND YOU CAN'T PULL HIM AWAY LET'S HAVE ANOTHER GO O. K. 
LEAVE 
HARVEY LEAVE LEAVE 
GOOD BOY MAKE A FUSS OF HIM 
GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
SORRY I DON'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU YEAH I DO 
THAT'S GOING TO STOP HIM GETTING DESTROYED YOU KNOW 
HARVEY NEEDS A BIT OF A SHAKE UP 
HE JUST THINKS HE CAN DO PRETTY MUCH WHAT HE WANTS 
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT AT ALL BECAUSE DANIELLE HAS ALLOWED THAT TO HAPPEN 
SHE I THINK WILL HAVE FOUND THAT EXERCISE REALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE SHE HAD TO REALLY TELL HIM OFF 
BUT YOU KNOW THIS DOG RUNS FORWARD AND BITES CHILDREN 
HE HAS BITTEN UNPROVOKED I NEED HARVEY TO KNOW SHE'S NOT MESSING WITH HIM WHEN SHE SAYS LEAVE IT 
IT'S NOT A REQUEST HE HAS TO LEAVE IT 
OVERNIGHT MIC HAS REACHED SOME CONCLUSIONS AS TO WHY BUDDY AND BRUNO HAVE BECOME SO DELINQUENT 
YOUR INTERACTION MARK WITH THE DOGS IN THE GARDEN IS THAT WHAT YOU DO ALL THE TIME YEAH 
BACK AT HOME MARK INDULGES IN AGGRESSIVE PLAY FIGHTING 
ALLOWING HIS DOGS TO JUMP UP AND BITE HIM 
I ALWAYS EQUATE THAT TO TEACHING A KID TO PUNCH YOU 
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE IT WOULD YOU NO 
I MEAN YOU WOULDN'T ENCOURAGE IT OH THAT WAS A GOOD PUNCH 
DO IT AGAIN 
YOU'RE TEACHING THEM UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR WHICH IS JUMPING UP AND USING HIS TEETH ON YOU 
HAVING PUT MARK IN HIS PLACE IT'S TIME TO PUT THE DOGS IN THEIRS 
MIC NEEDS TO SEE AN IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR BASIC OBEDIENCE TRAINING 
LET'S GO FOR IT HANDLERS AND DOGS NORMAL PACE FORWARD 
TURNING ABOUT ABOUT TURN HEEL 
THAT'S GOOD ANGE ONE ARM DON'T LET HIM PULL COME ON COME ON 
YOU'RE PAYING FOR ALL THAT FIGHTING 
UP 
YOU'RE TAKING THE PISS YOU ARE 
LITTLE BUDDY STILL ISN'T CLEARING THE JUMPS MIC HAS A SOLUTION 
I THINK YOU'RE SAYING UP A BIT TOO EARLY 
HE'S TAKING OFF AND HE'S GOING TO CLIP IT 
GO 
AND THEN GO AND THEN GO 
THE NEXT EXERCISE IS TO GET THE DOGS TO WAIT BEFORE ENTERING A GATE 
SIT BUDDY AND ANGE GET IT RIGHT FIRST TIME COME 
GOOD BOY DO THE SAME EXACTLY THE SAME 
SIT SIT 
BUT ONCE AGAIN MARK STRUGGLES 
I JUST THINK YOU'VE GOT THE SEQUENCE ALL WRONG 
GO FORWARD JUST GO FOR IT 
MARK JUST TAKE YOUR TIME MATE 
OH YES I'LL STAY HERE TILL MIDNIGHT NOW CALL HIM COME ON 
FINALLY THE BREAKTHROUGH DESPITE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS 
ANGE IS STILL NOT CONFIDENT ABOUT HER HANDLING SKILLS 
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO PASS WHATEVER TEST THEY'VE GOT ON THURSDAY I REALLY DON'T 
I'M REALLY SURPRISED THAT ANGE'S SAYING THINGS LIKE SHE'S FINDING IT REALLY DIFFICULT 
BECAUSE HER HANDLING IS REALLY GOOD AND IT'S A LOT BETTER THAN MARK'S 
ESPECIALLY IF I'VE GOT BRUNO 
WELL I JUST DON'T THINK BRUNO'S GOING TO DO IT 
MIC IS DETERMINED THAT HIS CHARGES WILL STEAL THE SHOW IN TOMORROW'S TESTS 
HE GRABS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH BRUNO AND BUDDY TO RETURN TO THEIR OWNERS ON DEMAND 
TURN PUT YOUR ARMS OUT GO COME AND AS HE COMES IN DOWN ONTO ONE KNEE GIVE HIM A TREAT 
COME 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES THESE FIREBRAND DOGS ARE RESPONDING TO ANGE'S COMMANDS COME 
COME NOW GO DOWN 
COME CALL THEM CALL THEM COME 
BUT MARK'S BOYS DON'T SEEM TO TAKE TOO KINDLY TO DADDY BOSSING THEM AROUND 
COME COME 
REFUSING TO RESPOND BRUNO RUNS STRAIGHT BACK TO ANGE 
HE LOVES HIS MUM DOESN'T HE 
I THOUGHT HE WAS YOUR DOG 
HE IS OR HE WAS 
SHE CAN LOOK AFTER THE PAIR OF THEM THAT WAS REALLY WEIRD THAT 
MARK'S A BIT DISAPPOINTED NOW I AM YEAH PISSED 
THERE WOULD BE NO ADVANTAGE TO YOU DOING ALL THIS WORK 
PUTTING UP WITH ALL MY BOLLOCKS AND THEN GOING AWAY AND PLAY FIGHTING 
NO WE'VE HAD A CHAT ABOUT THAT THAT'S JUST ALL SHIT ANYWAY 
WHEN YOU SEE YOUR DOGS GOING OVER THOSE JUMPS 
THAT'S GOT TO BE MORE REWARDING THAN WATCHING YOUR DOG BITING YOU ON THE ARM 
WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE WIRE HE CAN CALL IT TILL HE'S BLUE IN THE FACE 
THE FIRST THING THE DOG DID WAS GO STRAIGHT BACK TO MUM 
AND I THINK SHE WAS SHOCKED BUT I THINK HE WAS GUTTED 
THE TRUTH HURTS SOMETIMES THAT I LOOK AFTER THE DOGS I DO THIS THAT AND THE OTHER 
AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT I'M IN CHARGE AND YOU'RE NOT 
THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
I WOULDN'T HAVE DREAMT OF THAT LAST WEEK THAT WAS JUST SUCH AN ACHIEVEMENT 
MY ATTITUDE HAS CHANGED TOWARDS BRUNO AND US AS A PARTNERSHIP REALLY 
JUDGEMENT DAY AT DOG BORSTAL 
COME ON LAZY NELLIE GET UP 
IT'S HALF PAST SIX 
IN LESS THAN THREE HOURS' TIME HARVEY AND BRUNO AND BUDDY 
WILL FACE THE TOUGHEST BORSTAL CHALLENGE YET 
THE TEST TODAY WILL BE MARKED BY A TOUGH INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR 
RYAN O'MEARA IS A DOG TRAINER AND A BREED EXPERT 
HIS WORD IS FINAL IN DECIDING WHO WILL GRADUATE FROM DOG BORSTAL 
FIRST TO FACE THE FINAL TEST IS LITTLE PRINCE HARVEY 
FOR HIS TEST THE JUDGE HAS REQUESTED TO MEET OUTSIDE BORSTAL GROUNDS 
BEFORE COMING TO BORSTAL HALF PINT HARVEY WAS AN ANTI SOCIAL YOB 
CAN HE NOW PROVE HE'S NO LONGER A MENACE TO SOCIETY 
ANY AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR WILL BE MARKED DOWN AGAINST HIM 
BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HARVEY SNIFFS A FIGHT 
LEAVE HARVEY LEAVE LEAVE 
I'M A NERVOUS WRECK 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED I REALLY WANT HER TO DO IT 
LEAVE HARVEY LEAVE 
DANIELLE MUST NOW FIRMLY DISCIPLINE HIM TO AVOID FAILING THE TEST 
LEAVE 
HARVEY SEEMS TO GET THE MESSAGE 
WITHIN METRES OF ANOTHER DOG HARVEY ACTS AS IF HE JUST DOESN'T CARE 
THE TEST IS OVER 
BUT WILL HARVEY BE AWARDED A CERTIFICATE OR AN ASBO 
HE HAS TO HAVE GOT A DISTINCTION 
EVERYTHING THAT I WAS LED TO BELIEVE HE COULD DO WRONG HE WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WRONG 
AND THE ONE TIME HE MET A DOG THAT FACED UP TO HIM AT HIS OWN LEVEL 
HE DID HAVE A LITTLE BARK BUT YOU CORRECTED HIM PERFECTLY 
PASSED 
DISTINCTION 
BRILLIANT WELL DONE 
THERE'S YOUR CERTIFICATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I FEEL ABSOLUTELY ECSTATIC I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER 
SHE DID SO WELL SHE TRIED REALLY HARD SHE DIDN'T LOSE HER NERVE 
HE'S THE KING 
I'M A MAN OF MEANS BY NO MEANS 
KING OF THE ROAD 
FINALLY BRUNO AND BUDDY ARE UP BEFORE THE JUDGE 
I WAS AWAKE AT FIVE O'CLOCK THIS MORNING WONDERING ABOUT 
HOW THE DAY'S GOING TO GO HOW BRUNO'S GOING TO PERFORM FOR ME 
BEFORE BORSTAL THIS PAIR OF OUT OF CONTROL MOBSTERS TREATED THEIR OWNERS LIKE SERVANTS 
HAS MIC BEEN ABLE TO TEACH THESE TEARAWAYS THE MEANING OF RESPECT 
THE JUDGE WANTS TO TEST EACH DOG SEPARATELY 
ANGE IS HANDLING BRUNO 
THE DOG SHE MOST DISLIKED AT THE START OF THE WEEK 
CAN YOU DEMONSTRATE YOUR DOG ON THE AGILITY COURSE 
UP 
UP 
DOWN 
STAY GOOD BOY 
BRUNO BEHAVES WELL FOR ANGE 
BUT NOW IT'S HUSBAND MARK'S TURN 
IF HE CAN'T SHOW CONTROL OVER LITTLE BUDDY BOTH OF THEM COULD FAIL 
UP 
UP 
HE DIDN'T RUN EARLY ENOUGH DOWN 
DOWN HE'S NOT DOING THE DOWN 
HE'S NOT STAYING DOWN AT ALL 
HE'LL FAIL THIS TEST PROBABLY 
JUST STOP IT NOW FOR SAKE PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY 
WAIT 
NO 
NO 
FINALLY BOTH OWNERS ARE ASKED TO WORK AS A TEAM 
AND MARK KNOWS HE HAS TO PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS 
HEEL 
BACK HEEL 
PRETTY GOOD HERE HEEL 
MARK SUCCESSFULLY RAISES HIS GAME 
BUT WITH TIME NOW UP 
HAVE THEY EARNED PAROLE 
OR IS IT BACK TO THE DOGHOUSE FOR BUDDY AND BRUNO 
WOULD BE NICE TO FINISH OFF ON A HIGH FOR THE TWO OF THEM 
ESPECIALLY ANGE I THINK COS SHE'S DONE REALLY WELL 
BOTH PASSED THANK YOU WITH DISTINCTION 
CRACKING IF THE TARGET WAS TO GET CONTROL OF THE DOGS YOU REALLY HAVE GOT CONTROL OF THE DOGS 
IT'LL MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE TO OUR LIVES THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
CHEERS RYAN THANK YOU

CHEERS MATE THANKS A LOT HOW DO YOU FEEL 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC I'M BUZZING 
THERE'S NO GOING BACK NOW IS THERE 
NO DON'T SPOIL IT 
HE AIN'T HEAVY 
HE'S MY BROTHER 
IT'S BEEN A SUCCESSFUL WEEK AT DOG BORSTAL ALL THE DOGS HAVE PASSED WITH DISTINCTION 
BUT HAVE THEY CHANGED FOR GOOD 
IN SWINDON HAS BAD TEMPERED HARVEY CHILLED OUT 
I'VE GOT MORE OF A DOG NOW THAN A TOY I DON'T PICK HIM UP ALL THE TIME 
WE GO OUT ON MORE WALKS THAN WE EVER USED TO 
I'M NOT ALWAYS NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT'S AROUND THE CORNER 
OR WHO MIGHT COME AND TOUCH HIM 
I CAN TAKE HIM PAST CHILDREN AND HE'S USUALLY O. K. WITH THEM AND OTHER DOGS 
HE'S USUALLY FINE NOW I'VE GOT A LOT MORE CONTROL OVER HIM THAN I USED TO 
EVEN THE THOUGHT OF HAVING CHILDREN ISN'T A COMPLETE IMPOSSIBILITY ANY MORE 
BACK IN CHELTENHAM 
HAVE BUDDY AND BRUNO LOST THEIR APPETITE FOR CHEWING HOUSES 
WE CAN'T BELIEVE THE TRANSFORMATION YEAH THEY'RE LIKE DIFFERENT DOGS 
I DON'T THINK THE WANT TO CHEW IS THERE ANY MORE 
I DON'T FEEL DEMORALISED 
I DON'T FEEL UPSET AND ANXIETY DOESN'T CREEP IN ANY MORE 
IT'S SO MUCH BETTER COMPARED TO HOW IT USED TO BE 
I USED TO BE DRAGGED DOWN THE ROAD LITERALLY ALL THE TIME YEP 
THEY WERE MY MATES THEY WERE YOUR BOYS 
NOW THEY'RE DOGS I'VE GOT MY FAMILY 
SIMPLE THINGS LIKE COMING HOME FROM WORK AND JUST OPEN THE DOOR AND THEY'RE THERE PUSH PAST 
SAY HELLO TO MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER THEN GO AND SAY HELLO TO THE DOGS 
IT'S MADE A HELL OF A DIFFERENCE WE'VE RECLAIMED OUR LIVES 
WE'RE THE BOSSES NOW WE ENJOY EACH OTHER AND WE ENJOY THE FAMILY 
WELCOME TO A SPECIAL SHORT BUT BEAUTIFULLY FORMED EDITION OF FOOTBALL GAFFES GALORE 
SIT BACK AND ENJOY OUR FIRST CATEGORY THE TOP SIX LEGENDS LOUSING IT UP 
IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO SEE YOUR HEROES MESSING UP 
THEN LOOK AWAY NOW 
HERE'S ZIDANE ZIDANE FOR FRANCE OH HOW DID HE MISS 
LOOK AT THAT NOT ONE OF YOU 
YOU CAN'T WAIT CAN YOU 
IT'S CALLED SCHADENFREUDE TAKING PLEASURE IN THE MISFORTUNE OF OTHERS 
IT'S WHY WE ALL HAVE PICTURES OF DEBBIE MCGEE ON OUR WALLS DON'T WE 
GEORGE BEST COULD BEAT OTHER PLAYERS EFFORTLESSLY 
BUT AS USUAL WITH GEORGIE HIS BIGGEST BATTLE IS WITH HIMSELF 
OWN GOAL BY BOBBY MOORE 
IT'S A SHAME BOBBY MOORE WAS FACING THE WRONG WAY 
THIS IS A BRILLIANT DIVING HEADER 
LINEKER MAY HAVE HAD A GOLDEN BOOT 
BUT HIS HEAD WAS MADE OF MDF 
LINEKER WHAT A MISS BY THE ENGLAND STAR 
AND MARADONA MAY HAVE HAD THE HAND OF GOD 
BUT HE HAD THE FEET OF MARY MAGDALENE 
IT'S PELE OH MY GOODNESS WHAT A SHOCKER 
PELE COULD BEND THE BALL FROM ANYWHERE 
YOU LAUGH BUT SIX MINUTES LATER 
THIS BALL CAME BACK ONTO THE PITCH AND WENT IN 
THE TOP THREE DEAD BALL DEBACLES 
THESE ARE ALL FREE KICKS THAT WENT HORRIBLY WRONG 
DESPITE THE HOURS OF PRACTICE 
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK SCOTLAND SPENT WORKING THIS ONE OUT 
REMEMBER BOYS JUST LIKE WE DID ON THE TRAINING GROUND 
HANG ON DIDN'T ONE OF US HIT IT IN TRAINING 
THE SCOTTISH F. A. LABELLED THE URUGUAYANS 
THE SCUM OF THE EARTH AFTER THIS GAME 
IN RESPONSE URUGUAY ACCUSED THE SCOTS OF FILLING THE BALL WITH HELIUM 
AND LASTLY THE TOP FOUR OWN GOALS 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE HUMILIATING IN FOOTBALL THAN SCORING AN OWN GOAL 
EXCEPT FOR YOUR MOTHER TURNING UP HALFWAY THROUGH A GAME 
GRABBING YOU BY THE EAR AND HAVING A GO AT YOU IN FRONT OF YOUR MATES 
FOR CALLING YOUR GRANDMOTHER PONGO 
I WAS EIGHT 
OH IT'S AN OWN GOAL 
COME ON OWN UP WHO ORDERED THE SCOUSE O. GRAM 
IF YOU ARE GONNA SCORE AN OWN GOAL 
YOU MIGHT AS WELL MAKE IT ONE TO REMEMBER 
GO ON HAMMER IT HOME ENJOY THE MOMENT 
I WONDER IF DONACHIE EVER PLAYED FOR SCOTLAND AGAIN 
HANG ON LET ME CHECK MY NOTES 
RUSTLES PAPER 
NO
