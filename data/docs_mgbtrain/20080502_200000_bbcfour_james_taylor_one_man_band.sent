HI THIS IS JAMES TAYLOR ON B. B. C. FOUR 
WELCOME TO THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR ALL DAY ALL WEEK 
JAMES TAYLOR ALL THE TIME TELEVISION NETWORK 
SAYS GOODNIGHT YOU MOONLIGHT LADIES 
ROCK A BYE MY SWEET BABY JAMES 
DEEP GREENS AND BLUES ARE THE COLOURS I CHOOSE 
WON'T YOU LET ME GO DOWN IN MY DREAMS 
I PICKED UP THE GUITAR AT THE AGE OF TWELVE IN NINETEEN SIXTY 
AND I AND MY FRIEND DANNY KORTCHMAR 
WERE PLAYING IN CLUBS TOGETHER 
UM THEY WERE 
THEY WERE CALLED COFFEE HOUSES UM OR FOLK CLUBS 
AND THERE WAS AN OPEN MIC EVENING USUALLY 
AND THAT'S HOW PEOPLE GOT STARTED 
WITH AN OPEN MIC EVENING 
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE KARAOKE EXCEPT THERE WASN'T A BACKING TRACK 
YOU'D GET OUT AND SING AS BEST YOU COULD AND HOPE THEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW 
THROW ANYTHING TOO HARD 
AND AFTER I DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL 
WE WENT DOWN TO NEW YORK AND HE AND I STARTED A BAND WITH A COUPLE 
OF OTHER FRIENDS OF OURS AND WE WERE THE HOUSE BAND 
IN A PLACE CALLED THE NIGHT OWL CAFE 
YOU KNOW YOU'D GET A CUP OF COFFEE OR A DRINK 
AND LISTEN TO THE HOUSE BAND 
AND UM WE DIED OF STARVATION ESSENTIALLY 
AFTER WE JUST RAN OUT OF OPTIONS AND COULDN'T HOLD IT TOGETHER FOR A YEAR 
AND WE BROKE UP AS BANDS DO 
AND I CAME OVER HERE TO ENGLAND TO FOLLOW IT FURTHER 
MOONLIGHT LADIES 
ROCK A BYE MY SWEET BABY JAMES 
I HAD A COUPLE OF REALLY GOOD BREAKS 
ONE WAS BEING BORN DURING THE GREAT FOLK SCARE OF THE MID SIXTIES 
AS DANNY LIKES TO CALL IT 
AND THE OTHER ONE WAS MEETING PETER ASHER 
AND HAVING MY MUSIC HEARD BY PAUL MCCARTNEY AND GEORGE HARRISON 
AND SIGNING TO APPLE RECORDS IN SIXTY EIGHT 
I GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
I'M GONNA TRY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
I'LL GET HIGH WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM GOOD FRIENDS 
I HAD A FRIEND WHO LIVED IN TWICKENHAM 
DOWN THE WAY SOUTHWEST OF HERE 
AND HE TOOK ME IN FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
AND THEN I. I FOUND A BASEMENT FLAT 
AND ER NEAR NOTTING HILL GATE 
AND STARTED TRYING TO GET A RECORD DEAL 
WHICH CAME ALONG MIRACULOUSLY 
I PLAYED MOSTLY AT PEOPLE'S HOUSES AND PARTIES AND AT ONE POINT 
I'D PARK MYSELF IN THE UNDERPASS UNDERNEATH UM HYDE PARK 
THAT ROAD THAT GOES UP ALONG THE PARK THERE 
IT WAS GOOD ACOUSTICS AND YOU KNOW SMELT LIKE A MEN'S ROOM 
BUT IT SOUNDED GOOD AND PEOPLE WOULD DROP MONEY IN MY GUITAR CASE 
SO I SANG IN THERE FOR A WHILE 
GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
COME ALONG NOW WON'T YOU HELP ME MY FRIEND 
ONE MAN BAND IS AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SHOW 
AND AS MUCH AS THERE IS A SUBJECT TO IT I AM THE SUBJECT 
IT IS NOT CHRONOLOGICALLY SENSIBLE 
IT IS JUST A REACHING IN TO A DRAWER WITH A BUNCH OF MEMENTOES 
AND KEYS AND PHOTOGRAPHS AND STUFF AND COMING OUT WITH A BUNCH OF STUFF 
AND LAYING IT OUT ON THE TABLE AND SAYING SEE HERE YOU KNOW 
IN MY MIND I'M GOING TO CAROLINA 
CAN'T YOU SEE THE SUNSHINE 
I HAD IT IN MY MIND FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO GET BACK OUT 
AND ER THE LAST TIME I HAD DONE IT I THINK WAS IN THE LATE SEVENTIES 
SO I STARTED THINKING ABOUT HOW TO PRESENT THE SONGS 
AND IDEAS THAT I HAD FOR MAKING AN EVENING OUT OF IT 
BECAUSE AN EVENING OF SITTING DOWN AT A PIANO AND GUITAR AND PLAYING CAN 
IT RUNS THE RISK OF BEING A LITTLE BIT UM TEDIOUS 
AND IT DISTILLED ITSELF DOWN TO A. 
A SORT OF YOU KNOW ESSENTIAL DISTILLED JAMES TAYLOR 
CAROLINA 
IN MY MIND 
SHE HAS THE POWER TO GO WHERE NO ONE ELSE CAN FIND ME 
FULL SUMMER IN THE DEAR LOVELY BERKSHIRE HILLS 
MOSSY AND GREEN AND ABUNDANT WITH THAT FLINTY NEW ENGLAND RESOLVE 
TO WEATHER THE TEST OF THE WINTER TO COME 
IT'S A TIME FOR MUSIC 
TANGLEWOOD IS HERE 
SUMMER HOME OF THE BOSTON SYMPHONY 
THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT ME HERE IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS A PLACE TO PLAY 
A YEARLY STOP ON THE SUMMER TOUR FOR ME AND MY BAND 
THE LAST TIME I TOURED SOLO WAS IN THE LATE SEVENTIES 
THAT'S HOW I STARTED OUT 
JUST A GUITAR AND A HANDFUL OF SONGS 
AS TIME WENT BY 
I ADDED OTHER MUSICIANS BECAUSE IT'S GREAT PLAYING IN A BIG BAND 
BUT FROM TIME TO TIME 
IT'S GOOD TO GO BACK TO THE WELL 
IT'S GOOD TO GET BACK TO BASICS 
AND TO PRESENT THE SONGS IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM 
SO IT'S BEEN IN MY MIND FOR A WHILE TO WORK SMALL AGAIN 
THE COLONIAL THEATRE IN MY HOME TOWN OF PITTSFIELD MASSACHUSETTS 
JUST MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE WRECKING BALL 
PEOPLE HAVE INVESTED TIME MONEY AND THEMSELVES 
RESURRECTING THE OLD GIRL 
AND ALONG THE WAY THEY HAVE FOUND A NEW SENSE OF BELONGING 
A SENSE OF PLACE 
A PLACE CALLED HOME 
WHEN WE WERE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO FILM AND RECORD THIS ONE MAN BAND THING 
I KNEW AT ONCE THAT THE COLONIAL WOULD BE THE RIGHT PLACE 
IF YOU TRAVEL FOR A LIVING AND YOU DO IT LONG ENOUGH 
YOU CAN GET SO GOOD AT IT BUT YOU NEVER REALLY HAVE A HOME 
I'VE LIVED AND WORKED IN NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES LONDON AND PARIS 
SYDNEY AND RIO 
KIM HAS TRAVELLED THE WORLD TOO 
BUT THE BERKSHIRES ARE OUR HOME AT LAST 
SOMEHOW THE COLONIAL THEATRE THAT PLUCKY SURVIVOR 
IS AT THE HEART OF THE PLACE 
SOMETHING IN THE WAY SHE MOVES 
WELL THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE WAY SHE MOVES 
OR LOOKS MY WAY OR CALLS MY NAME 
THAT SEEMS TO LEAVE THIS TROUBLED WORLD BEHIND 
AND IF I'M FEELING DOWN AND BLUE 
OR TROUBLED BY SOME FOOLISH GAME 
SHE ALWAYS SEEMS TO MAKE ME CHANGE MY MIND 
I FEEL FINE ANY TIME SHE'S AROUND ME NOW 
SHE'S AROUND ME NOW 
ALMOST ALL THE TIME 
AND IF I'M WELL YOU CAN TELL THAT SHE'S BEEN WITH ME NOW 
AND SHE'S BEEN WITH ME NOW 
QUITE A LONG LONG TIME AND I FEEL FINE 
EVERY NOW AND THEN THE THINGS I LEAN ON 
LOSE THEIR MEANING AND I FIND MYSELF CONVENING 
IN PLACES WHERE I SHOULD NOT LET ME GO NO 
SHE HAS THE POWER TO GO WHERE NO ONE ELSE CAN FIND ME 
AND TO SILENTLY REMIND ME 
OF THE HAPPINESS AND GOOD TIMES THAT I KNOW 
WELL I GUESS I JUST GOT TO KNOW THEM 
IT ISN'T WHAT SHE'S GOT TO SAY 
OR HOW SHE THINKS OR WHERE SHE'S BEEN 
TO ME THE WORDS ARE NICE THE WAY THEY SOUND 
I LIKE TO HEAR THEM BEST THAT WAY 
IT DOESN'T MUCH MATTER WHAT THEY MEAN 
SHE SAYS THEM MOSTLY JUST TO CALM ME DOWN 
I FEEL FINE ANY TIME SHE'S AROUND ME NOW 
SHE'S AROUND ME NOW 
I GUESS JUST ABOUT ALL THE TIME 
AND IF I'M WELL YOU CAN TELL THAT SHE'S BEEN WITH ME NOW 
AND SHE'S BEEN WITH ME NOW 
QUITE A LONG LONG TIME 
YES AND I FEEL FINE 
WHOO 
I'LL SING A SONG FOR YOU NOW CALLED THE FROZEN MAN 
THE WAY HE APPEARED IN THIS PICTURE IN THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC UM 
IT'S ACTUALLY SURPRISING HOW LITTLE I KNOW ABOUT THE FROZEN MAN 
GIVEN THE FACT THAT I SING THIS SONG ABOUT HIM 
BECAUSE UM I DIDN'T REALLY READ THE TEXT IN THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 
I JUST 
I LOOKED AT THE PICTURES AND READ THE LITTLE CAPTION 
BUT I GOT THE GIST OF IT JUST ENOUGH TO WRITE A SONG 
I'LL SING IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE 
UM I KNOW THAT ER HE WAS PART OF A POLAR EXPEDITION 
ATTEMPTING TO FIND A SEA ROUTE FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE PACIFIC OCEANS 
BY SAILING OVER CANADA AND OVER ALASKA 
WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A TERRIBLE IDEA 
A DISASTROUS IDEA 
AND I KNOW THAT HE HAD BEEN IN HIS GRAVE 
IN THE SHALLOW GRAVE THAT WAS HACKED IN TO THE PERMAFROST FOR HIM 
FOR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS WHEN THEY FINALLY FOUND HIM 
WHEREAS YOU AND I WOULD NEVER DISTURB A HALLOWED RESTING PLACE 
THESE WERE SCIENTISTS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS 
AND THEY DIDN'T HESITATE 
YEAH PUT A CROW BAR 
OR THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL EQUIVALENT OF A CROWBAR UNDER THE LIP OF HIS COFFIN 
AND JUST 
POP JUST POP HIM RIGHT OUT OF THE ICE LIKE 
LIKE AN ICE CUBE OUT OF ONE OF THOSE FLEXIBLE ICE CUBE TRAYS 
AND SEE HIM SLIDING OH THERE HE GOES 
STOP THE FROZEN MAN 
AND THEY STOOD HIM UP HE STOOD UP REAL GOOD AND ER GOOD 
AND THEY TOOK HIS PICTURE REPEATEDLY 
UM WHICH JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT EVEN IF YOU 
EVEN IF YOU DIED BEFORE THE INVENTION OF A PHOTOGRAPHY 
YOU'RE STILL NOT SAFE 
ANYWAY THEIR SHIP WAS CAUGHT IN THE ICE TRAPPED IN THE PACK ICE 
AND THIS IS AN ARTIST'S RENDITION OF IT 
ACTUALLY IT LOOKS COSY TO ME 
IT LOOKS KIND OF AS THOUGH THEY'RE UNDER 
YOU KNOW SNUG UNDER THE TARPAULIN THERE 
SMOKING TOBACCO AND TRADING RIPPING YARNS OF THE SEA 
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THE OLD TIMERS SAYING THIS IS NOTHING 
YOU YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HARDSHIP THIS IS NOTHING 
THEY ALL DIED OF COURSE 
PRETTY TERRIBLE THING BUT YOU KNOW IT WAS ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
AND I'VE GOTTEN OVER IT IT'S TIME TO 
MOVE ON 
ANYWAY SOME TIME AFTER I RELEASED THE SONG SOMEONE SENT ME THIS NEWSPAPER 
SO I WASN'T THE ONLY PERSON THINKING OF REANIMATING 
THE FROZEN MAN AND AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS 
THIS IS THE NEWS OF THE WORLD 
THIS IS PRETTY MUCH A BASTION OF JOURNALISTIC EXCELLENCE 
AND TRUTH IN REPORTING THE NEWS OF THE WORLD 
ANYWAY THE SONG'S NOT AS LONG AS THE INTRODUCTION 
IT'S GROWN 
HERE'S A PICTURE OF SOME SNOW TO GET US IN THE MOOD 
SOME TRACKLESS FROZEN WASTES 
GOODBYE TO THEM I GUESS 
GOD HAVE MERCY ON THE FROZEN MAN 
LAST THING I REMEMBER IS THE FREEZING COLD 
WATER REACHING UP JUST TO SWALLOW ME WHOLE 
ICE IN THE RIGGING AND HOWLING WIND 
SHOCK TO MY BODY AS WE TUMBLED IN AND DIED 
MY BROTHERS AND THE OTHERS WERE LOST AT SEA 
I ALONE AM RETURNED TO TELL THEE 
HIDDEN IN ICE FOR A CENTURY 
I WALK THE WORLD AGAIN 
LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE FROZEN MAN 
NEXT WORDS THAT WERE SPOKEN TO ME 
NURSE ASKED ME WHAT MY NAME MIGHT BE 
SHE WAS ALL IN WHITE AT THE FOOT OF MY BED 
I SAID ANGEL OF MERCY I'M ALIVE OR AM I DEAD 
MY NAME IS WILLIAM JAMES MCPHEE 
I WAS BORN IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THREE 
I WAS RAISED IN LIVERPOOL BY THE SEA 
BUT THAT AIN'T WHO I AM 
LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE FROZEN MAN 
IT TOOK A LOT OF MONEY TO START MY HEART 
JUST TO PEG MY LEG AND TO BUY MY EYE 
THE NEWSPAPERS CALL ME STATE OF THE ART 
AND THE CHILDREN WHEN THEY SEE ME 
CRY 
WELL I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE JUST TO VISIT MY GRAVE 
SEE WHAT KIND OF TOMBSTONE I MIGHT HAVE 
THERE LAY THE WIFE AND DAUGHTER AND IT SEEMED SO STRANGE SO STRANGE 
BOTH OF THEM DEAD AND GONE FROM EXTREME OLD AGE 
I SAY WHEN I DIE MAKE SURE I'M GONE 
DON'T LEAVE 'EM NOTHING TO WORK ON 
YOU CAN RAISE YOUR ARM YOU CAN WIGGLE YOUR HAND 
UNLIKE MYSELF 
SO YOU CAN WAVE GOODBYE TO THE FROZEN MAN GOODBYE 
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO FREEZE TO DEATH 
TO LOSE A LITTLE LIFE WITH EVERY BREATH 
TO SAY GOODBYE TO LIFE ON EARTH 
TO COME AROUND AGAIN 
LORD HAVE MERCY I'M THE FROZEN MAN 
GOD HAVE MERCY ON THE FROZEN MAN 
HAVE MERCY ON THE FROZEN MAN 
THANK YOU 
NOW THAT'S SORT OF A CASE IN POINT ONE THOUGHT THAT SONG WHEN I WROTE IT 
I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT THE FROZEN MAN 
A FROZEN DUDE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
SORRY TO DO THE SLIDE OVER THERE 
BUT ACTUALLY OVER TIME I'VE COME TO REALISE 
THAT IT'S JUST ANOTHER SONG ABOUT MY DAD 
THERE'S A PICTURE OF MY DAD TAKEN IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE IN THE SOUTH POLE ACTUALLY 
HE WAS A BIT OF A POLAR EXPLORER HIMSELF 
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE FAMILY STORY 
BASICALLY IT'S THAT MY DAD MET MY MUM IN BOSTON 
HAD FIVE KIDS 
MOVED US ALL DOWN TO NORTH CAROLINA 
AND UM IMMEDIATELY JOINED THE NAVY 
AND WENT TO THE SOUTH POLE FOR TWO YEARS 
SO THAT'S IT REALLY 
UM HERE'S A PICTURE OF MY MUM TAKEN AROUND THE SAME TIME 
THINKING ABOUT MURDER 
THINKING ABOUT MURDER 
THINKING ABOUT HER HOME IN NEW ENGLAND 
SO FAR AWAY AND HER HUSBAND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE EARTH THERE 
HERE'S A PICTURE OF THEM BOTH TOGETHER FOR YOU 
HAPPIER DAYS 
WE STARTED PUTTING THIS EVENING TOGETHER ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO 
AND WE DECIDED TO TRY TO AVOID THE SORT OF MODERN GIMMICKS 
AND YOU KNOW ALL THE AVAILABLE SORT OF DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSORS 
AND FLANGERS AND PHASERS AND RING MODULATORS AND ALL KINDS OF 
AND FOR SURE WE WEREN'T GOING TO USE ANY DRUM MACHINE 
THAT WAS OUT NO DRUM MACHINE ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTION 
RIGHT OUT FROM THE TOP 
OF COURSE WE CAVED IN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND YEAH SO 
CLEAR 
JUST TAKE ALL THE MONEY THAT WE NEED FOR SCHOOL 
TO KEEP THE PEOPLE IN OUTTA THE COLD 
AND SPEND IT ON A WEAPON YOU CAN NEVER USE 
MAKE THE WORLD AN OFFER THAT THEY CAN'T REFUSE 
OPEN THE DOOR AND LET THE SHARK MEN FEED 
HOOVER UP THE FUTURE IN THE LAND OF GREED 
SELL THE PONDEROSA TO THE JAPANESE 
SLAP LEATHER HEAD FOR THAT LINE OF TREES YEAH 
SLAP LEATHER 
GO ON RON 
JUST ABOUT TO KILL MYSELF 
TURN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD 
INTO A T. V. SHOW 
SO IT'S THE SAME GAME WHEREVER YOU GO 
YOU NEVER MEET A SOUL THAT YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW 
ONE LONG COMMERCIAL FOR THE STATUS QUO 
AS IF THESE CELEBRITIES ARE YOUR CLOSE FRIENDS 
AS IF YOU KNEW HOW THE STORY ENDS 
AS IF YOU WEREN'T SITTIN' IN A ROOM ALONE 
AND THERE WAS SOMEBODY REAL AT THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE OH 
SOMEONE'S IN DANGER

ON THE CORNER OF SANTA MONICA AND DOHENEY 
THAT'S KIND TO CALL IT A NIGHTCLUB IS TO STRETCH IT 
IT'S A DIVE AND A JOINT YOU KNOW 
A HOLE IN THE WALL AND IT JUST SEEMS TO THRIVE ON NEGLECT 
IT CONTINUES YEAR AFTER YEAR 
AND I PLAYED THERE REPEATEDLY EVIDENTLY IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES 
THAT PICTURE WAS NOT TAKEN IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES THE CARS ARE WRONG 
AND THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THEIR COSTUMES ON 
AND PURPLE HAZE WOULD BE ALL IN THEIR BRAINS 
THE TROUBADOUR 
AND WHEN I PLAYED THERE THE THREE TIMES I PLAYED THERE 
I SHARED THE BILL WITH CAROLE KING HERE'S A PICTURE OF CAROLE 
THAT'S THE POET 
SHE AND I SHARED A BAND THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE LOOKED LIKE IN THOSE DAYS

ANYWAY UM I ER 
CAROLE HAD WRITTEN THIS GREAT THIS GREAT SONG 
REALLY A PERFECT POP SONG I THOUGHT 
AND CAROLE IN AN AMAZING 
WHAT ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE A TYPICALLY GENEROUS GESTURE 
INSISTED THAT I TAKE THE FIRST CRACK AT THIS TUNE AND RECORD IT FIRST 
SHE WAS IN THE STUDIO RECORDING HERSELF BUT SHE LET GO OF WHAT 
TO MY MIND WAS THE PERFECT SONG 
I DIDN'T REALISE THEN THAT I WOULD BE SINGING IT 
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE 
AND GLAD TO REALLY COS IT'S A GREAT SONG TO BE KNOWN FOR 
SO ANYWAY I ASKED JONI MITCHELL IF SHE WOULD SING SOME HARMONIES WITH ME 
ON IT AND AT THE TIME SHE WAS MY TODAY YOU'D SAY SHE WAS MY BITCH 
IT SEEMS RUDE 
IT SEEMS RUDE THOUGH WHEN YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT IT'S 
I WAS HER BITCH TOO

I'LL SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF MY FIRST CAR 
CORTINA G. T. ENGLISH FORD NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
THOSE PEOPLE WEREN'T IN IT WHEN I BOUGHT IT 
AND ER THE FACT THEY SEEM TO BE SMILING IN THIS PICTURE 
INDICATES THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ANY REAL DISTANCE IN THE CAR 
BUT YOU KNOW YOU LOVE YOUR FIRST CAR 
YOU LOVE IT SO AND I DID 
AND ALSO IT REPRESENTS TO ME THAT YEAR OF NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
WHICH WAS THE MOST INCREDIBLE YEAR IN MY LIFE PROBABLY 
I MEAN IT'S NOT OVER YET 
AND IT WAS PRETTY AMAZING 
I WAS A HUGE BEATLES FAN 
I WENT TO LONDON JUST TO TRAVEL BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO 
I WAS A KID NINETEEN I GUESS 
I MADE A DEMO TAPE AT THE URGING OF SOME FRIENDS I MET OVER THERE 
THEY SHOPPED IT AROUND EVENTUALLY PETER ASHER HEARD IT 
PLAYED IT FOR PAUL MCCARTNEY AND GEORGE HARRISON 
AND THEY SIGNED ME THE FIRST ACT TO BE SIGNED TO APPLE RECORDS 
IT WAS AS IF SOMEBODY HAD OPENED A DOOR 
IT'S AMAZING OBVIOUSLY 
THE MOTHER OF ALL BIG BREAKS 
IT WAS AS IF SOMEBODY HAD OPENED A DOOR AND THE REST OF MY LIFE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT 
I THINK THAT HAPPENS OFTEN BUT IN A NEGATIVE WAY 
USUALLY SOMEONE OPENS A DOOR AND ER 
HELL ON THE OTHER SIDE ANYWAY 
GETTING A LITTLE PUNCHY HERE 
THE YEAR DID END IT HAD TO END 
AND I SENT THE CAR HOME ON A BOAT 
AND I FLEW HOME AND THERE WAS A TEARFUL REUNION ON THE DOCKS IN ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY 
AND I HOPPED IN MY CORTINA AND STARTED DRIVING DOWN THE COAST TO NORTH CAROLINA 
BECAUSE I HADN'T SEEN MY FAMILY IN BETTER THAN A YEAR 
AND ER DURING THAT YEAR MY BROTHER ALEX AND HIS WIFE BRENT HAD HAD A BABY 
FIRST CHILD BORN TO OUR GENERATION IN MY FAMILY 
AND IN A MOMENT OF LAPSED JUDGMENT THEY NAMED THE CHILD AFTER ME LITTLE BABY JAMES 
SO I HAD TO GO DOWN AND SEE THIS LITTLE VARMINT 
GO DOWN AND SEE LITTLE JAMES 
YEAH THAT IS CUTE 
IF YOU LIKE CHILDREN 
BUT ANYWAY AS I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE COAST 
I WAS THINKING TO MYSELF WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD SONG 
TO SING FOR A LITTLE HONORARY VARMINT LIKE JAMES 
AND IT HAD TO BE A COWBOY LULLABY 
YOU KNOW GO TO SLEEP YOU LITTLE BUCKAROO 
OR LIGHTS OUT IN THE BUNKHOUSE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SOMETHING BY ROY ROGERS OR GENE AUTRY 
THAT'S HOW THIS NEXT SONG GOT WRITTEN 
THERE IS A YOUNG COWBOY HE LIVES ON THE RANGE 
HIS HORSE AND HIS CATTLE ARE HIS ONLY COMPANIONS 
HE WORKS IN THE SADDLE AND HE SLEEPS IN THE CANYONS 
JUST WAITING FOR SUMMER HIS PASTURES TO CHANGE 
YES AND AS THE MOON RISES HE SITS BY HIS FIRE 
JUST THINKING ABOUT WOMEN AND GLASSES OF BEER 
AND CLOSING HIS EYES AS THE DOGIES RETIRE 
HE SINGS OUT A SONG WHICH IS SOFT BUT IT'S CLEAR 
JUST AS IF MAYBE SOMEONE COULD HEAR 
HE SAYS GOOD NIGHT ALL YOU MOONLIGHT LADIES 
ROCK A BYE SWEET BABY JAMES 
DEEP GREENS AND BLUES FOR THE COLOURS I CHOOSE 
WON'T YOU LET ME GO DOWN IN MY DREAMS 
AND ROCK A BYE SWEET BABY JAMES 
NOW THE FIRST OF DECEMBER WAS COVERED WITH SNOW 
YES AND SO WAS THE TURNPIKE FROM STOCKBRIDGE TO BOSTON 
OH THE BERKSHIRES SEEMED DREAM LIKE ON ACCOUNT OF THAT FROSTING 
WITH TEN MILES BEHIND ME AND TEN THOUSAND MORE TO GO NO 
THERE'S A SONG THAT THEY SING WHEN THEY TAKE TO THE HIGHWAY 
A SONG THAT THEY SING WHEN THEY TAKE TO THE SEA 
A SONG THAT THEY SING OF THEIR HOME IN THE SKY 
MAYBE YOU CAN BELIEVE IT IF IT HELPS YOU TO SLEEP 
JUST THAT SINGING SEEMED TO WORK FINE FOR ME 
GOOD NIGHT ALL YOU MOONLIGHT LADIES 
ROCK A BYE MY SWEET BABY JAMES 
DEEP GREENS AND BLUES FOR THE COLOURS I CHOOSE 
WON'T YOU LET ME GO DOWN IN MY DREAMS 
OH 
ROCK A BYE MY SWEET BABY JAMES 
THIS LAST SONG WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU ALSO TAKES US BACK TO ENGLAND 
AND TO NORTH CAROLINA AS WELL 
I WAS IN ENGLAND RECORDING MY FIRST RECORD 
AND I WAS USING THE TIME THAT THE BEATLES WERE MAKING THE WHITE ALBUM IN THE SAME STUDIO 
AND I WAS USING WHATEVER TIME THEY WEREN'T USING IT TO DASH IN AND PUT DOWN A COUPLE OF TRACKS 
WHEN THEY WERE FINISHED WITH ONE OF THEIR MARATHON SESSIONS 
IT WAS REALLY QUITE AMAZING 
BUT THEY DECIDED TO TAKE A BREAK AND THEY CLOSED DOWN THE STUDIO TO DO SOME WORK 
AND I HAD SOME TIME ON MY HANDS 
SO I WENT WITH SOME FRIENDS TO AN ISLAND IN THE MEDITERRANEAN CALLED FORMENTERA 
OFF THE COAST OF SPAIN NEAR IBIZA AND NEAR MAJORCA 
I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME A NICE VACATION 
I MET A GIRL THERE A YOUNG WOMAN BY THE NAME OF KAREN 
AND ALTHOUGH WE ONLY KNEW EACH OTHER FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME 
WE GREW CLOSE 
BUT STRANGE TO SAY I HAVE NO PICTURE I NEVER SAW HER AGAIN 
I ALMOST DID TWENTY YEARS LATER IN COPENHAGEN BUT NO 
SO I THOUGHT I'D TRY AND EXPERIMENT ON THE INTERNET 
I FOUND A POLICE SKETCH ARTIST 
THE GUYS WHO MAKE THOSE FORENSIC DRAWINGS OF PERPETRATORS 
THAT YOU SEE IN THE POST OFFICE AND STUFF 
THEY WERE OFFERING THEIR WARES OVER THE INTERNET AND THEIR SERVICES 
SO I CALLED UP AND SAID IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE PERSON FOR LIKE THIRTY FIVE YEARS 
CAN YOU STILL MAKE A DECENT DRAWING 
AND HE SAID IT JUST DEPENDS ON YOUR DESCRIPTION 
I WILL DRAW WHAT YOU SAY 
HE SAID WHY DON'T YOU JUST RELAX AND GIVE IT A TRY 
I SAID O. K. WELL SHE WAS SCANDINAVIAN SWEDISH GIRL 
ABOUT FIVE FOOT SIX I THINK MEDIUM BUILD ABOUT TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD 
YOU KNOW SHOULDER LENGTH BLONDE HAIR WIDE FOREHEAD 
PIERCING BLUE EYES NARROW CHIN AND A FULL MOUTH 
AND A FRECKLY BUT ER DEEP FRECKLY TAN SORT OF 
HE SAID YEAH I THINK I CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING 
I SAID WELL HOW SOON CAN I HOPE TO SEE SOMETHING 
AND HE SAID WELL IF YOU JUST CHECK YOUR E. MAIL TOMORROW I'LL SEND YOU SOMETHING 
I SAID WOW THAT'S FANTASTIC 
SO THE NEXT DAY I WAS VERY KEEN I GOT UP SURE ENOUGH I HAD MAIL 
I OPENED IT RIGHT UP AND THIS IS WHAT HE HAD SENT 
SO I CALLED HIM UP AND SAID SEE HERE THIS'LL NEVER DO ET CETERA YOU KNOW 
HE SAID JUST RELAX IT'S MY LITTLE JOKE 
I ACTUALLY JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I'VE GOT THE RIGHT ADDRESS BEFORE I SEND IT ON 
AND THEN HE SENT ALONG THIS 
WHICH IS MAYBE A LITTLE BETTER A LITTLE CLOSER 
IT DOESN'T REALLY CONFLICT WITH MY IDEA OF WHO KAREN WAS 
SO THE THING IS NOW I CAN'T STOP THINKING OF HER NOW AS A CRIMINAL 
WELL 
I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME BUT MORE AND MORE I WAS SUFFERING HOMESICKNESS 
I MISSED MY DAD AND HIS BICYCLE 
I MISSED MY DOG HERCULES I MISSED MY PUMPKIN COLLECTION 
I MISSED NORTH CAROLINA AND THIS SONG WAS THE RESULT 
IN MY MIND I'M GOING TO CAROLINA 
CAN'T YOU SEE THE SUNSHINE 
CAN'T YOU JUST FEEL THE MOONSHINE 
AIN'T IT LIKE A FRIEND OF MINE 
TO TAKE ME FROM BEHIND 
OH I'M GOING TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
KAREN SHE'S A SILVER SUN 
YOU BEST WALK HER WAY AND WATCH IT SHININ' 
WATCH HER WATCH THE MORNIN' COME 
A SILVER TEAR APPEARING NOW I'M CRYIN' AIN'T I 
I'M GOING TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
THERE AIN'T NO DOUBT IN NO ONE'S MIND 
THAT LOVE'S THE FINEST THING AROUND 
WHISPER SOMETHING SOFT AND KIND 
AND HEY BABY THE SKY'S ON FIRE I'M DYIN' AIN'T I 
AND I'M GOING TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
IN MY MIND I'M GOING TO CAROLINA 
CAN'T YOU SEE THE SUNSHINE 
CAN'T YOU JUST FEEL THE MOONSHINE 
AIN'T IT LIKE A FRIEND OF MINE 
TO HIT ME FROM BEHIND 
TILL I'M GOING TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
DARK AND SILENT LATE LAST NIGHT 
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE HEARD THE HIGHWAY CALLING 
GEESE IN FLIGHT AND DOGS THAT BITE 
SIGNS THAT MIGHT BE OMENS SAY I GOING I'M GOING 
I'M GOING TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
IT'S WITH A HOLY HOST OF OTHERS STANDING ROUND ME 
STILL I'M ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT GOES ON LIKE THIS FOREVER OH 
YOU MUST FORGIVE ME 
IF I'M GONE TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
IN MY MIND I'M LONG GONE TO CAROLINA 
CAN'T YOU SEE THE SUNSHINE 
I SAID CAN'T YOU JUST FEEL THE MOONSHINE 
AIN'T IT JUST LIKE A FRIEND OF MINE 
TO HIT ME FROM BEHIND 
OH I'M GONE TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
OH I'M GONE TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
SO I'M ALREADY GONE I'M GONE 
SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT ME I'M GONE 
YOU'LL HAVE TO CARRY ON WITHOUT ME 
I'M GONE 
OH I'M GONE TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
I'M GONE 
YES I'M GONE TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
HERE'S ANOTHER SONG ABOUT NORTH CAROLINA 
ABOUT RED DIRT AND PINE NEEDLES AND TURPENTINE 
AND SOMETHING CALLED TOMATO WINE 
I DON'T KNOW 
COPPERLINE 
EVEN THE OLD FOLKS NEVER KNEW 
WHY THEY CALL IT LIKE THEY DO 
I WAS WONDERIN' SINCE THE AGE OF TWO 
DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
COPPER HEAD COPPER BEECH 
COPPER KETTLES SITTING SIDE BY EACH 
COPPER COIL COPPER GEORGIA PEACH 
DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
HALF A MILE DOWN TO MORGAN CREEK 
I'M ONLY LIVING TILL THE END OF THE WEEK 
HERCULES AND A HOG NOSED SNAKE DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
TAKE ME DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
WARM SUMMER NIGHT ON COPPERLINE 
SLIP AWAY PAST SUPPER TIME 
WOOD SMOKE AND MOONSHINE YEAH DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
ONE TIME I SAW MY DADDY DANCE 
WATCHED HIM MOVING LIKE A MAN IN A TRANCE 
HE BROUGHT IT BACK FROM THE WAR IN FRANCE 
DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
BRANCH WATER AND TOMATO WINE 
CREOSOTE AND TURPENTINE 
SOUR MASH AND NEW MOONSHINE 
DOWN OLD COPPERLINE YEAH 
TAKE ME DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
OH FIRST KISS EVER I TOOK 
STOLEN FROM A PAGE FROM A ROMANCE BOOK 
THE SKY OPENED AND THE EARTH SHOOK 
DOWN ON COPPERLINE WALK ME DOWN 
TOOK A FALL FROM A WINDY HEIGHT 
I ONLY KNEW HOW TO HOLD ON TIGHT 
AND PRAY FOR LOVE ENOUGH TO LAST ALL NIGHT 
DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
DAY BREAKS AND THE BOY WAKES 
AND THE DOG BARKS AND THE BIRD SINGS AND THE SAP RISES 
AND THE ANGELS SIGH 
YEAH 
I TRIED TO GO BACK AS IF I COULD 
ALL SPEC HOUSE AND PLYWOOD 
TORE UP TORE UP GOOD DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
IT DOESN'T COME AS A SURPRISE TO ME 
IT NEVER TOUCHED MY MEMORY 
WHILE I'M LIFTING UP AND RISING FREE 
DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
HALF A MILE DOWN TO MORGAN CREEK 
I'M ONLY LIVING TILL THE END OF THE WEEK 
HERCULES AND A HOG NOSED SNAKE DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
OH COPPERLINE 
WE WERE DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
OH DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
TAKE ME BACK DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
TAKE ME DOWN ON COPPERLINE 
IT JUST REMAINS FOR ME TO THANK YOU 
FOR COMING OUT I WANT TO THANK
