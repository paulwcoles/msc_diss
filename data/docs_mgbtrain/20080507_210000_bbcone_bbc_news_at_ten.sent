REMAINED NOBODY IS 
GONE DEAD BODIES LYING 
QUITE DESPERATE TODAY AS 
PLACES THAT WERE 
WASN'T MUCH THIS 
IRRAWADDY DELTA THERE 
THE INTERNATIONAL 
PEOPLE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DIDN'T 
HAVE TO PERSUADE THE WORST AFFECTED 
GOVERNMENTS TO LET THEM HELP THE 
GENERALS HERE REFUSED THEN AND THIS 
TIME AROUND ARE ONLY SLOWLY 
RELUCTANTLY OPENING THE DOOR TO 
HELP BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING FAST 
ENOUGH FOR THOSE STILL SUFFERING 
BUT THE RESCUE OPERATION IS AT THE 
MOMENT DESPERATELY SLOW THE LONGER 
IT TAKES THE MORE CHANCE THAT 
DISEASE WILL GET A GRIP ON THOSE 
ALREADY WEAKENED BY FIVE DAYS 
WITHOUT FOOD SHELTER AND WATER 
THE WRANGLING OVER PERMISSIONS AND 
VISAS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL AID 
GROUPS MAY BE COSTING LIVES BY THE 
HOUR 
AS WE HEARD BURMA'S MILITARY 
LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN RESISTING MORE 
EXTENSIVE AID EFFORT AS THE CRISIS 
DEEPENS HOW LIKELY ARE THEY TO 
LISTEN TO THE APPEALS OF THE WORLD 
COMMUNITY AND OPEN THE COUNTRY'S 
BORDERS BRIAN HANRAHAN IS HERE 
WITH THIS ASSESSMENT YOU MUST 
UNDERSTAND IN THE MIND OF A 
DICTATOR LETTING IN OUTSIDE 
ASSISTANCE REQUIRE AS COMPLEX 
CALCULATIONS IF THEY DON'T THE 
BURMESE GENERALS KNOW THEY ARE RISK 
THE FURY OF PEOPLE WITH LITTLE TO 
LOSE IF THEY DO THEY ARE 
PERMITTING THE OUTSIDE INFLUENCES 
THAT FOR DECADES THEY HAVE FEAR 
WOOD UNDERMINE THEIR AUTHORITY 
THE UN HAS BEEN PREPARING TO 
AIRLIFT AID SUPPLIES SO FAR ONLY 
INDIA CHINA AND THAILAND HAVE BEEN 
PERMITTED TO SEND THEM THE 
EXPERIENCE OF BIG DISASTERS IS THAT 
SPEED IS ESSENTIAL TO SAVE LIVES 
THE BURMESE JUNTA ARE ILL QUIPPED 
FOR SWIFT DECISION MAKING THE 
PRIME MINISTER HAS BEEN SHOWN 
HANDING OUT SMALL AID PARCELS NO 
SIGN OF THE MASSIVE OPERATION 
NEEDED TO MAKE A DISASTER OF THIS 
MAGNITUDE 
THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES MAGNITUDE HAVE TO SHOW A WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND ASSESSMENT 
TEAMS AND INDEED OPERATIONAL TEAMS 
FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF AID 
CLASSICALLY THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO 
BE GIVEN THE AID AND ALLOW TO 
IT HAS THE CAPABILITY 
TO DO THAT 
LET ALONE NECESSARILY THE WILL TO 
DO IT PROPERLY 
THE MOST COMPARABLE 
DISASTER WAS THE TSUNAMI IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR IN 
THE INDIAN OCEAN THEN THE U. S. NAVY 
MOUNTED AN UNPRECEDENTED RESCUE 
OPERATIONS DEPLOYING DOZENS OF 
HELICOPTERS AND THOUSANDS OF 
MARINES OFF THE COAST OF INDONESIA 
AMERICA HAS SIMILAR RESOURCES IN 
THE REGION NOW BUT IT HAS OFFER TO 
HELP IS UNLIKELY TO BE ACCEPTED 
THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE 
SUSPICIOUS THAT THE U. S. WOULD TRY TO 
TOPPLE IT THIS LATEST ESTIMATE OF 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEAD WILL STEP UP THE 
PRESSURE ON THE BURMESE GENERALS 
THE FRENCH ARE ALREADY TALKING OF 
FORCING THEM TO ACCEPT HELP 
THAT THEY WILL BE SUSPICIOUS THAT 
IT'S AMERICA THAT HAS RELEASED THE 
STATISTICS FOR THE GENERAL SHOULD 
THEY TRY TO SAVE THEIR PEOPLE OR 
THEMSELVES 
GORDON BROWN HAS BEEN CHALLENGED TO 
EXPLAIN HIS VIEWS ON WHETHER THE OF SCOTLAND SHOULD GET AN 
EARLY OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON 
INDEPENDENCE DAVID CAMERON THE 
CONSERVATIVE LEADER SAYS THERE HAS 
BEEN A LACK OF CLARITY ON THE ISSUE 
FOLLOWING REMARKS BY LABOUR'S 
SCOTTISH LEADER WENDY ALEXANDER 
SHE HAS SUGGESTED THAT THERE SHOULD 
BE A REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH 
INDEPENDENCE BEFORE TWO THOUSAND TEN THAT IS 
THE DATE SET BY THE GOVERNING S. N. P. 
IS GORDON BROWN WILLING TO RISK A 
REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE 
WHICH HE BELIEVES WOULD TEAR THE 
UNITED KINGDOM APART COULD HE DO 
SO IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE THE UNION 
QUESTIONS HE SIMPLY REFUSES TO GIVE 
A STRAIGHT ANSWER TO LABOUR'S LABOUR'S LEADER IN SCOTLAND WENDY ALEXANDER 
SAYS THERE SHOULD BE A REFERENDUM 
NOW ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE DOES 
HE AGREE WITH HER 
THAT IS NOT WHAT 
SHE HAS SAID 
HOLD ON A SECOND HERE SHE IS ON 
SUNDAY 
I DON'T FEAR 
THE VERDICT OF SUNDAY THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE BRING IT ON 
ON MONDAY 
IT'S RIGHT TO GIVE THEM 
THE CHOICE 
THEN SAYING GORDON 
BROWN AGREED WITH HER 
IS GORDON 
BROWN ENDORSING YOUR DECISION TO 
CALL FOR A REFERENDUM YES HE YES HE SEINE DORSING IT YES 
HE TOLD YOU YES THAT YES 
DAVID CAMERON TOLD AGAIN THAT YES BACKING A REF WAS SOMETHING GORDON 
BROWN WAS SIMPLY NOT GOING TO DO 
WHAT THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY 
IN SCOTLAND WAS POINTING TO WAS THE 
HOLE OWENESS OF THE SCOTTISH 
NATIONAL PARTY THAT SAID THEY 
WANTED INDEPENDENCE SAID THEY 
WANTED IT IMMEDIATELY AND NOW 
WANTED TO POSTPONE A REFERENDUM 
UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TEN AND ELEVEN 
GORDON BROWN WAS 
SIMPLY AFRAID TO GIVE A CLEAR 
ANSWER TODAY HAVING BEEN DROPPED 
INTO IT BY LABOUR'S SCOTTISH LEADER 
IF HE BACKED HER CALL FOR AN 
EARLIER REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE 
THE QUESTION WOULD HAVE FOLD WHY 
DON'T YOU CALL ONE NOW IF ON THE 
OTHER HAND HE REJECTED IT HE WOULD 
HAVE MADE HER POSITION UNTENABLE 
THE MAN TO BLAME FOR LABOUR'S 
CONTRAZICTIONS AND CONFUSE WAS ALEX 
SALMOND SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER 
NOT LONG BEFORE GORDON BROWN BECAME 
PRIME MINISTER THE LEADER OF THE 
SCOTTISH NATIONALISTS IS SORING IN 
THE POLLS TONIGHT HE IS REL ESHING 
LABOUR'S DISCOMFORT 
EITHER HE IS 
MISREPRESENTING HER OR SHE IS 
MISREPRESENTING HIM OR THEY ARE 
BOTH MISREPRESENTING EACH OTHER 
THE BEST YOU CAN SAY CONFUSION AND 
DISARRAY THE WORST I SUPPOSE 
THEY ARE TRYING TO ECONOMICAL WITH 
THE TRUTH 
THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER 
SAYS THAT VOTERS DESERVE STRAIGHT 
ANSWERS 
IT'S QUITE CLEAR WENDY ANSWERS ALEXANDER MEANT BRING ON A 
REFERENDUM NOW 
YET HE DENIES THAT IN THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS HE MUST THINK THE WHOLE 
COUNTRY IS FULL OF IDIOTS BEYOND BEYOND THE CONFUSION WHAT IS CLEAR TONIGHT 
IS THAT GORDON BROWN IS PONDERING 
WHETHER AN EARLY REF ON SCOTTISH 
INDEPENDENCE MIGHT JUST BE THE BEST 
WAY TO DEFEAT IT 
DMITRY MEDVEDEV HAS BEEN SWORN IN 
AS THE NEW PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA 
SUCCEEDING VLADIMIR PUTIN WHO 
SERVED FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS HE 
WAS INAUGURATED AT CEREMONY IN THE 
KREMLIN WITHIN A FEW HOURS MR. 
MEDVEDEV HAD NOMINATE PLD PUTIN 
HIS POLITICAL MENTOR AS RUSSIA'S 
NEW PRIME MINISTER IN THE UNITED 
STATES HILLARY CLINTON SAYS SHE 
WILL FIGHT ON IN THE RACE TO BECOME 
THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE DESPITE GROWING CALLS 
FROM DEMOCRATS FOR HER TO STAND 
ASIDE HER OPPONENT BARACK OBAMA 
HAS STRENGTHENED HIS LEAD AFTER 
WINNING THE PRIMARY IN NORTH 
CAROLINA MRS. CLINTON WON THE 
INDIANA CONTEST BY A NARROW MARGIN 
ON WARDS EVER ON WARDS SHE KNOWS NO 
OTHER WAY IN THE SUNSHINE OF WEST 
VIRGINIA SHE TALKED OF YESTERDAY'S 
DISAPPOINTMENT AS IF IT HAD BEEN A 
SUCCESS AS IF A VICTORY IN THIS 
STATE MIGHT CHANGE THE LOGIC OF THE 
PROCESS 
WEST VIRGINA IS ONE OF PROCESS THOSE SO CALLED SWING STATES 
DEMOCRATS NEED TO WIN IT IN THE 
FALL I WANT TO START BY WINNING IT 
IN THE SPRING TO LAY THE GROUND 
WORK FOR A VICTORY IN NOVEMBER 
EVEN IN THIS CROWD THE VULTURES 
WERE CIRCLING LIGHTLY BUT FIRMLY 
THE BARACK OBAMA SUPPORTERS SEEM TO 
BE SAYING YOUR TIME IS UP WHAT 
THEN IS THE ARGUMENT FOR HER 
CARRYING ON 
I THINK SHE SHOULD 
STAY IN THE RACE SHE HAS A GLOBAL 
PERSPECTIVE BUT SHE HAS HER FINGER 
ON THE PULSE OF THE INDIVIDUAL 
SHENT DAMAGING THE PARTY 
I DON'T 
BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE 
STRENGTH CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH 
OUR SYSTEM OF COMPETITION SHE SHE CAN'T WIN CAN SHE 
YES SHE CAN 
HOW 
SHE IS THE GREATEST ONE OUT HOW THERE SHE CERTAINLY IS AN THERE EXTRAORDINARY PERSON IT COULD BE 
THAT THIS IS HER WAY OF SAYING 
GOOD BYE PERHAPS THIS IS ALL 
ABOUT A DIGNIFIED EXIT PERHAPS SHE 
FEELS SHE HAS TO GO ON CAMPAIGNING 
AT LEAST UNTIL THE END OF THE 
PRIMARY SEASON WHICH IS ON JUNE THIRD 
PERHAPS SENATOR OBAMA WILL KNEEL IS 
A REASONABLE THING FOR HER TO DO 
PERHAPS THIS IS THE CAMPAIGN 
MESSAGE 
I'M STAYING IN THIS RACE MESSAGE UNTIL THERE IS A NOMINEE L. 
OBVIOUSLY AM GOING TO WORK AS HARD 
AS I CAN TO BECOME THAT NOMINEE 
THAT IS WHAT I'VE DONE THAT IS 
WHAT I'M CONTINUING TO DO 
I BELIEVE ARE BELIEVE I'M THE 
STRONGER CANDIDATE AGAINST SENATOR 
MCCAIN I BELIEVE I WOULD BE THE 
BEST PRESIDENT AMONG THE THREE OF 
US RUNNING 
BARACK OBAMA IS BACK 
THIS TIME IT APPEARS HE IS BACK TO 
STAY ALREADY TODAY A HANDFUL OF 
UNCOMMITTED SUPER DELEGATES HAVE 
COME OUT FOR HIM HIS FOCUS NOW IS 
ON WINNING IN NOVEMBER 
THIS FALL 
WE INTEND TO MARCH FORWARD AS ONE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY UNITED BY A COMMON 
VISION FOR THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE WE 
ALL AGROW THAT AT THIS DEFINING 
MOMENT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GIVE JOHN 
MCCAIN THE CHANCE TO SERVE OUT 
GEORGE BUSH'S THIRD TERM WE NEED 
CHANGE 
HE IS NOT YET THE NOMINEE CHANGE BUT TONIGHT HE LOOKS LIKE ONE 
COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
BIGGER THAN RIO'S CHRIST THE 
REDEEMER BUT WHAT WILL THE DESIGN 
IN THIS FIELD IN KENT ACTUALLY LOOK 
LIKE 
NOW AS THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE 
AWAIT TO HEAR THERE IS TO BE A RUN 
OFF ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY 
PRESIDENT MUGABE'S FUTURE IS 
CLEARLY IN THE BALANCE IF HE IS 
DEFEATED HE MAY FACE TRIAL FOR 
CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN THE 
EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES TROOPS LOYAL TO MUGABE 
RAMPAGED THROUGH MATABELELAND 
KILLING TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO OPPOSED 
HIS RULE THE SOLDIERS HAD BEEN 
ORDERED TO KILL POLITICAL 
DISSIDENTS BUT IT TURNED INTO A 
MASSACRE JOHN SIMPSON HAS BEEN 
BACK TO ZIMBABWE TO INVESTIGATE 
PRESIDENT MUGABE'S INVOLVEMENT WE 
SET OUT AT THREE THIRTY A M. IN THE MORNING 
SO AS TO AVOID THE POLICE 
ROADBLOCKS 
I WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY ROADBLOCKS WITH LOCAL HELP WE WERE HEADING 
DEEP INTO MATABELELAND SOUTH FROM 
BULAWAYO TO AN AREA CALLED ANTELOPE 
THE SITE OF AN OLD CONCENTRATION 
CAMP DATING BACK TO THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
WHEN ROBERT MUGABE WAS NEWLY IN 
POWER WE FOUND THAT MOST OF THE 
BUILDINGS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY 
DESTROYED BUT NOT ALL 
THIS ONE BROUGHT BACK TERRIBLE 
MEMORIES FOR THE WOMAN WHO HAD 
ACCOMPANIED US THE LAST TIME SHE 
WAS HERE SHE WAS A PRISONER A 
CHILD OF ELEVEN 
SOME OF THEM THEY 
JUST BEAT THEM UNTIL THEY DIE THEN 
THEY JUST LET YOU OFF THE FIRE 
THEN YOU PAIN UNTIL YOU DIE IF I 
REMEMBER NOW MY HEART IS SO PAINFUL 
THESE ARE THE MEN RESPONSIBLE THE 
ZIMBABWEAN ARMY'S FIFTH BRIGADE 
THEY WERE TRAINED IN KILLING BY 
NORTH KOREANS LATER MR. MUGABE 
REFERRED TO THE MASSACRES FRANKLY 
AS MOMENT OF MADNESS AT THE TIME 
HE FENDED OFF QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM 
WHERE EVER YOU HAVE OPERATIONS YOU 
ARE BOUND TO HAVE ONE OR TWO UNTOE 
WARD INCIDENTS BUT NOT THE MASS 
GRAVES WHICH THEY TALKED ABOUT 
WHERE ARE THEY 
THIS MAN KNOWS 
HE'S A SURVIVING MEMBER OF THE 
FIFTH BRIGADE WE TRACKED HIM DOWN 
HE EXPLAINED THAT THEY HAD BEEN 
ORDERED TO KILL ROBERT MUGABE'S 
POLITICAL ENEMIES HE HAD 
PERSONALLY MURDERED PEOPLE AT THE 
CAMP WE HAD BEEN TO AT ANTELOPE 
AND HE TOLD US WHAT HAD BEEN DONE 
WITH THE BODIES THROWN DOWN A 
NEARBY MINESHAFT WE HEADED OFF 
THERE YOU CAN JUST SEE THE 
BUILDINGS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
WITH SOME PEOPLE STANDING IN FRONT 
OF IT WE HAD TO BE VERY CAREFUL 
HERE BECAUSE THE ENTIRE AREA IS 
CONTROLLED BY A MILITIA LOYAL TO 
ROBERT MUGABE GETTING THERE WAS A 
TENSE BUSINESS AT THE MINEHEAD WE 
LOWERED OUR CAMERA DOWN THE SHAFT 
TO SEE IF THE BONES STILL LAY AT 
THE BOTTOM BUT THEY HAD BEEN RE 
BURIED IN THE BUSH CLOSE BY A FEW 
YEARS AGO TO HIDE TRACES OF THE 
MASI MASSACRE AN OLD MAN HAD 
WATCHED AS THE NEW GRAVES WERE DARK 
AND HE SHOWED US WHERE THEY WERE 
ACCORDING TO A CATHOLIC COMMISSION 
WHICH INVESTIGATED THE MASSACRES IN 
MATABELELAND AT LEAST TWENTY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE DIED ALTOGETHER BACK IN 
BULAWAYO WE WENT TO SEE THE FORMER 
CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP WHO HAD 
COURAGEOUSLY PROTESTED ABOUT THE 
KILLINGS DID HE I ASKED THINK 
THAT ROBERT MUGABE WAS RESPONSIBLE 
WHO CAN GIVE ORDERS AND WHO 
BROUGHT THE NORTH KOREANS IN TO 
FIND THE SOLDIERS FOR KILLING AND 
TAKE THE SOLDIERS MUGABE SENT THEM 
TO KILL SO I BELIEVE IT 
MATABELELAND WAS ZIMBABWE'S KILLING 
FIELD BUT WILL ANYBODY BE BROUGHT 
TO TRIAL FOR WHAT HAPPENED HERE 
NOT NECESSARILY AFTER ALL THE 
MAIN REASON WHY ROBERT MUGABE AND 
HIS CLOSEST ASSOCIATES HAVE CLUNG 
TO POWER SO FIERCELY HAS BEEN THEIR 
FEAR THAT THEY WOULD SPEND THE REST 
OF THEIR DAYS IN PRISON MAYBE A 
NEW GOVERNMENT HERE MIGHT THINK IT 
WAS BETTER TO MEND A BROKEN SOCIETY 
BY FORGIVING ROBERT MUGABE RATHER 
THAN BY PUNISHING HIM 
THE AIRPORT OPERATOR B. A. A. HAS BEEN 
STRONGLY CRITICISED BY A 
PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE 
INVESTIGATING THE CHAOTIC OPENING 
OF TERMINAL FIVE AT LONDON HEATHROW 
AIRPORT BRITISH AIRWAYS HAS ALSO 
BEEN DEFENDING ITS ACTIONS ITS 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE ADMITTED THAT WITH 
HINDSIGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
BETTER TO POSTPONE THE OPENING A 
COMMITTEE MEMBER SAID THE EPISODE 
HAD BEEN A NATIONAL HUMILIATION 
PRINCES WILLIAM AND HARRY JOINED 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AT A FUND 
RAISING PARADE IN LONDON THIS 
EVENING TO HELP RAISE MONEY FOR 
INJURED MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES 
THE PRINCES BOTH SERVING IN THE 
BRITISH ARMY WERE AT THE CITY 
SALUTE FOR SUNSET FLY PAST 
POSITIONS AND A LIGHT AND SOUND 
SHOW PROCESSIONS 
AS MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY AND 
AS SERVING ARMY OFFICERS PRINCES 
WILLIAM AND HARRY CANNOT SAY OR DO 
ANYTHING WHICH HAS A POLITICAL 
RESONANCE YET THE TREATMENT OF 
BRITAIN'S ARMED FORCES AND 
EQUIPPING OF THOSE WHO FIGHT AND 
CARE OF THOSE WHO FALL IS A 
POLITICAL ISSUE AND THE PRINCES 
HAD BROUGHT IT INTO EVEN SHARPER 
BURKE SHARPER FOCUS THE PAGEANT 
INSPIRED BY WILLIAM AND HARRY 
SPONSORED BY THE CITY OF LONDON AND 
STAGED ON THE STEPS OF SAINT PAUL'S 
CATHEDRAL WAS INTENDED TO SAY 
THANK YOU TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF 
THE ARMED FORCES AND RAISE MONEY 
FOR FACILITIES LIKE THOSE WHICH 
WILLIAM AND HARRY SAW FOR 
THEMSELVES RECENTLY AT HEADLEY 
COURT A MILITARY REHABILITATION 
CENTRE IN SURREY COINCIDENTALLY 
THE GOVERNMENT CHOSE YESTERDAY TO 
ANNOUNCE TWENTY FOUR MILLION OF EXTRA 
FUNDING FOR HEADLEY COURT BUT 
THERE ARE FORCEFUL VOICES SAYING 
THIS IS NOT ENOUGH 
THERE ARE A 
GREAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY 
WHO CARE FOR THE ARMED FORCES 
THINK ABOUT THE ARMED FORCES WORRY 
ABOUT THEIR WELL BEING AND THE 
GOVERNMENT MIGHT RESPOND BY LOOKING 
AFTER THEM A LITTLE MORE CAREFULLY 
FOR AN HOUR THE MILITARY PUT ON A 
SHOW THERE WERE EVEN CHINOOK 
HELICOPTERS AND A JOKE ABOUT USING 
THEM TO GET TO STAG PARTIES BUT 
THIS WAS A PAGEANT WITH A SERIOUS 
PURPOSE TO REMIND BRITAIN OF THOSE 
WHO FIGHT IN HER NAME WILLIAM AND 
HARRY WOULD DENY ABSOLUTELY THEY 
HAVE POLITICAL AGENDA AS SUCH 
BUT THIS IS THEIR PAGEANT AND IT 
HAS A MESSAGE IT IS THAT MEN LIKE 
THESE WHO HAVE DONE THEIR BIT FOR 
BRITAIN SHOULD NOT BE ABANDONED BY 
BRITAIN 
CANNABIS IS TO BE RECLASSIFIED AS A 
MORE HARMFUL DRUG THE HOME 
SECRETARY ANNOUNCED THE CHANGE 
TODAY DESPITE OFFICIAL ADVICE TO 
LEAVE IT AS CLASS C. SUBSTANCE IT 
WAS DOWNGRADED FOUR YEARS AGO BY 
TONY BLAIR'S GOVERNMENT THE 
ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE MISUSE OF 
DRUGS SAID THE MOVE WAS NOT 
JUSTIFIED ON THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE 
FOR THREE DECADES CAMPAIGNER CHRIS 
BALDWIN HAS BEEN SMOKING CANNABIS 
HE DREAMS OF IT BEING LEGALISED BUT 
IN REALITY POSSESSING IT IS A 
CRIME AND ONE THE GOVERNMENT PLANS 
TO TAKE MORE SERIOUSLY IN FUTURE 
AGAINST EXPERT ADVICE TODAY 
MINISTERS LAID OUT THE CASE FOR 
CANNABIS RETURNING TO BE A CLASS B. 
DRUG THE CATEGORY IT WAS IN UNTIL 
FOUR YEARS AGO THEY POINTED TO THE 
RECENT EXPLOSION OF HIGH STRENGTH 
CANNABIS BEING GROWN ILLEGALLY BY 
ORGANISED CRIMINALS THEY ARE 
WORRIED IT COULD BE MENTAL HEALTH TIMEBOMB 
THERE IS A COMPELLING TIMEBOMB CASE FOR US TO ACT NOW RATHER THAN 
RISK THE FUTURE HEALTH OF YOUNG 
PEOPLE WHERE THERE IS A CLEAR AND 
SERIOUS PROBLEM BUT DOUBT ABOUT 
THE POTENTIAL HARM THAT WOULD BE 
CAUSED WE MUST ERR ON THE SIDE OF 
CAUTION AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC THE THE MAIN CONCERN IS SKUNK A VARIETY 
THREE TIMES STRONGER THAN THE 
CANNABIS OF A DOZEN YEARS AGO TO 
SHOW HOW EASY IT NOW IS TO BUY 
CANNABIS IN SOME PARTS OF LONDON 
WE HAVE COME TO CAMDEN ON AN EARLY 
SUMMER EVENING WITH A HIDDEN CAMERA 
WITHIN MINUTES OUR RESEARCH WAS 
BEING OFFERED SKUNK 
RESEARCHER 
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO PAY GIVE 
ME FIFTEEN QUID 
THE CONVERSATION TOOK 
PLACE IN THE HIGH STREET IN FULL 
PUBLIC VIEW 
IT IS A BIT INTENSE AT 
TIMES 
ROCCO KNOWS THE POTENTIAL TIMES DANGERS OF SKUNK HIS HEAVY USE LET 
HIM TO DEPRESSION PARANOIA AND 
PSYCHOSIS LED HIM 
I BELIEVE IT 
DID ENHANCE ANY MENTAL HEALTH 
ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE EXISTED L. 
DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE GONE TO 
HAVE TO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST OR WHAT 
HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DRUG 
INDUCED PSYCHOSIS IF IT HADN'T BEEN 
FOR CANNABIS 
SO WHY ARE SO MANY 
EXPERTS AGAINST THE CHANGE WHAT IS 
THE CASE FOR CANNABIS STAYING IN 
CLASS C. THERE IS NO DOUBT THE DRUG 
IS GETTING MORE POTENT THE 
FORENSIC SCIENCE SERVICE VOUCHES 
FOR THAT BUT MANY USERS SMOKE LESS 
WHEN THE CANNABIS IS STRONGER AND 
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE RARE 
CANNABIS DOES HAVE MENTAL HEALTH 
EFFECT BUT THEY ARE PRETTY UNUSUAL 
YOU WOULD NEED TO PREVENT FIVE THOUSAND 
YOUNG MALES FROM TAKING CANNABIS TO 
STOP ONE CASE OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AND 
FOR WOMEN IT WOULD BE TWENTY THOUSAND SO SO THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN EXPERTS THINK 
THE KEY IS DRUGS EDUCATION NOT 
RECLASSIFICATION BUT FOR WHATEVER 
REASON GENUINE CONCERN OR 
POLITICAL CALCULATION MINISTERS 
HAVE DECIDED TO IGNORE THE 
SCIENTISTS AND MOVE CANNABIS BACK 
TO CLASS B.
