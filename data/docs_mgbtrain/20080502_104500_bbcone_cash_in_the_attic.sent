AN ECCLESIASTICAL VICTORIAN SILVER CHALICE 
WELCOME TO CASH IN THE ATTIC THE THE SHOW THAT FINDS HIDDEN TREASURES 
AROUND YOUR HOME AND THEN WE HELP YOU SELL THEM AT AUCTION 
COMING UP ON TODAY'S CASH IN THE ATTIC 
PAUL TAKES A FIRM HAND WITH A HOUSEFUL OF GIRLS 
EMERALD LORNE YES YOU CALLED 
I'M BUSY HUNTING DOWN A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND 
WHERE ARE THE DIAMONDS 
I HAVE HAD A GOOD LOOK AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE 
AND AT AUCTION WE SET OURSELVES A HIGH TARGET BUT WILL IT ALL END IN TEARS 
DON'T WORRY O. K. 
IT'S ONLY STUFF 
FIND OUT WHEN TODAY'S COLLECTIBLES GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
I'M ON MY WAY TO MEET A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER 
THEY'VE CALLED IN CASH IN THE ATTIC 
TO HELP THEM RAISE SOME FUNDS FOR A VERY SPECIAL OCCASION 
TODAY WE'RE IN KENSAL GREEN NORTH WEST LONDON 
WHERE DEVOTED MOTHER ASHLEY 
AND HER TEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER EMERALD LIVE 
THEIR HOME IS CRAMMED FULL OF WONDERFUL ITEMS GATHERED FROM ALL FOUR CORNERS OF THE WORLD 
AH GOOD MORNING HOW ARE YOU 
I'M FINE ARE YOU IN THE PARTY MOOD YES I AM 
GOOD I'M MEETING A LOVELY LADY TODAY AND HER DAUGHTER 
SHE'S A PSYCHOANALYST SO IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
ER WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD 
NO IT SOUNDS GREAT ACTUALLY I'LL GET IT ALL OFF MY CHEST 
STARTING WITH ANTIQUES HOPEFULLY 
I LIKE THAT A PARTY AND A BIT OF THERAPY YES ALL WRAPPED INTO ONE 
GOOD MORNING HELLO 
NICE TO SEE YOU AND I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU'VE STARTING RUMMAGING ALREADY EMERALD 
SO TELL ME WHY HAVE YOU CALLED IN CASH IN THE ATTIC 
IT WAS EMERALD'S IDEA ACTUALLY 
SHE SAW IT ON THE TELLY DIDN'T YOU DO YOU WANT TO TELL THEM 
I WAS AT MY MUM'S CLIENT'S HOUSE 
AND SHE WAS WATCHING CASH IN THE ATTIC 
AND I THOUGHT WE COULD TRY AND GO ON 
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY ON EXACTLY 
WELL WE HAVE AN IDEA THAT WE'D LIKE TO TAKE A SPECIAL HOLIDAY 
IN THE SUMMER WHEN EMERALD FINISHES PRIMARY SCHOOL 
BEFORE SHE GOES TO SECONDARY SCHOOL IT'S A BIG MOMENT 
AND WE ALSO WANT TO THROW HER A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY PARTY 
ALL RIGHT O. K. HOW OLD ARE YOU GOING TO BE ELEVEN 
O. K. SO WHAT BIRTHDAY PARTY PLANS HAVE YOU GOT IN MIND 
I REALLY WANT TO GO ICE SKATING 
AND HOW MUCH MONEY ARE YOU LOOKING TO RAISE THEN 
WELL WE'RE HOPING TO RAISE MAYBE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
WE'D LIKE TO HAVE A REALLY SPECIAL HOLIDAY AND BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO GO 
AWAY FOR A FEW WEEKS RATHER THAN JUST A WEEK OR TWO 
SO WE NEED TO RAISE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TOWARDS YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY AND THE HOLIDAY FUND 
YES IN WHICH CASE SHALL WE GET ON 
YEAH COME ON THEN SHOW ME YOUR BEDROOM 
ASHLEY AND EMERALD'S HOUSE IS TRULY AN ALADDIN'S CAVE 
FULL TO BURSTING WITH FASCINATING ORNAMENTS AND COLLECTIBLES 
THAT THEY'VE GATHERED TOGETHER ON THEIR TRAVELS 
WE'VE GOT A BUSY DAY SELECTING ITEMS WHICH ARE MOST LIKELY TO DO WELL AT AUCTION 
SO WE CAN HIT OUR TARGET OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE PAUL'S MAKING A CLEAN SWEEP HE'S FOUND SOMETHING THAT'S PUT A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE 
AH THERE YOU ARE PAUL HELLO WHAT ON EARTH HAVE YOU FOUND THERE 
THIS IS THE LAST THING I'D EXPECT TO FIND ACTUALLY 
IT'S A DIAMOND MERCHANT'S BOX 
WHERE ARE THE DIAMONDS 
I HAVE HAD A GOOD LOOK AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE 
BUT WHAT A RARE THING 
AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ONE BOLTED ON TO THE SIDE IS A BATH 
AND WHAT THE DEALER WOULD DO WOULD BE TO WASH THE STONES OR CONDUCT MINOR REPAIRS WITH THE WHOLE THING 
IT'S JUST REALLY UNUSUAL ISN'T IT 
SO WHERE DID THIS COME FROM 
SRI LANKA WE WERE TRAVELLING WE HAD A LONG HONEYMOON 
AND WE FOUND THIS IN A LITTLE SHOP WHILE WE WERE SEARCHING FOR GEMS 
AND MY HUSBAND COULDN'T RESIST IT 
PAUL HAVE YOU GOT A DIAMOND VALUATION FOR US ON THIS ONE 
I THINK THAT'S A VERY UNUSUAL ITEM 
A GEMOLOGIST OR A JEWELLER WOULD LOVE THAT 
AND I THINK VALUE WISE EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
DOES THAT SOUND ALL RIGHT SOUNDS GREAT 
IT'S A GREAT START AND I THINK WE NEED TO GET CRACKING 
FOLLOW ME LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN FIND 
THIS DIAMOND BOX IS UNIQUE ESPECIALLY WITH ITS OWN LITTLE BOWL DESIGNED FOR WASHING THE STONES 
IT'LL BE A RARE SIGHTING AT AUCTION SO IT'S TRICKY TO TELL HOW IT WILL DO 
BUT NO TIME TO CELEBRATE JUST YET 
AS WE MUST HUNT OUT MANY MORE HIDDEN GEMS 
AND ASHLEY PROVES TO BE A NATURAL BORN RUMMAGER WITH HER NEXT DISCOVERY 
PAUL YEP 
LOOK AT THAT 
WOW THAT'S BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT 
IS THAT A FAMILY HEIRLOOM 
WELL IT CAME FROM MY GRANDMOTHER 
WELL SHE HAD AN EYE FOR QUALITY THIS IS GOLD 
THOSE ARE DIAMONDS THERE 
AND THOSE ARE SEED PEARLS AND THE WHOLE THING REPRESENTS A STARBURST 
TYPICAL VICTORIAN IT'S HAD AN ALTERATION 
SOMEONE HAS MADE THIS INTO A BROOCH ACTUALLY 
OH WHAT WAS IT A PENDANT ORIGINALLY 
IT'S BEEN LIKE A STICK PIN I THINK 
IF I JUST TAKE THIS MOVE IT OUT THE WAY CAN YOU SEE THOSE HOLES THERE 
THAT'S WHERE IT'S BEEN ATTACHED TO A PIN 
VALUE WISE IT HAS GOT A STONE MISSING 
SO YOU HAVE TO ALLOW A LITTLE BIT FOR THAT BUT I WOULD SAY AT LEAST 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HUNDRED THAT SORT OF PRICE BAND 
GOOD YES THAT'LL ADD SOMETHING TO OUR TOTAL 
I THINK LUCK'S ON YOUR SIDE 
YOUR FORTUNE'S IN YOUR STARS TODAY 
ALL RIGHT WELL LET'S KEEP LOOKING 
WELL I'M PLEASED REALLY THAT IT WAS VALUED 
FOR THAT MUCH BECAUSE I HAVEN'T WORN IT MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE 
IT HAS NEVER REALLY FELT LIKE SOMETHING THAT SUITED ME 
IT DIDN'T WEAR VERY WELL 
I'M SURE MY GRANDMOTHER WOULDN'T MIND ME SELLING IT 
IF IT GOES FOR TWO HUNDRED THAT'LL BE AMAZING THAT'LL BE BRILLIANT 
ANOTHER LOVELY AND INDIVIDUAL ITEM WHICH REALLY SHOULD ATTRACT THE BIDDERS AT AUCTION 
THERE'S MORE RUMMAGING TO BE DONE AND SOON ENOUGH 
ASHLEY BRINGS OUT THIS ELEGANT BLACK LACQUERED TABLE VALUED BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND AT SIXTY TO EIGHTY THIS GOTHIC OAK WALL BRACKET WILL ADD NICELY TO OUR FUND 
WE GIRLS HAVE FOUND SOME GORGEOUS ITEMS BUT PAUL UPSTAIRS 
HAS MADE A DISCOVERY AND FINDS HIMSELF SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES 
WHOSE ARE ALL THESE DOLLS MINE REALLY HAVE YOU COLLECTED THEM ALL 
YEAH WHOSE IS THIS OLD PRAM MINE 
REALLY IS THAT NOT YOUR MUM'S NO 
THIS IS QUITE GOOD THIS IS METAL 
THIS ONE DATES PROBABLY NINETEEN SIXTY THAT SORT OF TIME IT'S A LONG TIME AGO 
THEY'RE RARE NOWADAYS BECAUSE PEOPLE USED THE WHEELS 
ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'D USE THAT FOR 
UM NO 
USED TO MAKE GO CARTS AND THAT WAS THE THING 
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND VERY FEW OF THESE HAVE ACTUALLY SURVIVED 
TO BE HONEST THESE SORT OF THINGS ARE BOUGHT BY BIG GIRLS PEOPLE WHO REMEMBER THESE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN SO I THINK VALUE WISE YOU'VE GOT FORTY MAYBE FIFTY NOW 
DOES THAT SOUND O. K. YEAH 
ALL RIGHT THAT'S GOING TO AUCTION 
LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN FIND ALL RIGHT YES 
BUT THERE'S NO TIME TO STOP AND PLAY JUST YET 
WE MUST SEARCH HIGH AND LOW FOR MORE OBJECTS OF VALUE 
LIKE THIS STUNNING LACQUERED FRAMED MIRROR 
WHICH ASHLEY BOUGHT FROM A FRIEND'S FURNITURE SHOP 
AND PAUL VALUES AT FORTY TO SEVENTY 
ASHLEY AND EMERALD HAVE LIVED IN THIS HOUSE TOGETHER FOR THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS 
SADLY ASHLEY'S HUSBAND GILES DIED WHEN EMERALD WAS JUST A TODDLER 
AND SINCE THEN ASHLEY HAS BEEN RAISING EMERALD ON HER OWN 
DESPITE THEIR LOSS THE HOUSE IS ALIVE WITH HAPPY MEMORIES AND SOUVENIRS OF YEARS OF TRAVELLING 
WOW YOU'VE GOT SO MANY ITEMS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
WHAT SET YOU OFF TRAVELLING 
WELL THAT'S WHAT ONE DOES WHEN ONE'S YOUNG 
WHEREABOUTS DID YOU GO 
WE HAD A THREE MONTH HONEYMOON HOW WONDERFUL 
IT WAS YES AND THAT BEGAN IN THAILAND AND WE WENT TO NEPAL 
SO THEN OBVIOUSLY YOU HAD EMERALD 
YEAH INDEED 
AND I MEAN SHE'S OBVIOUSLY TEN NOW 
YES SHE'S ALMOST ELEVEN WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE ON THE NAME EMERALD 
WELL IT WAS A NO BRAINER REALLY BECAUSE HER DAD WAS OBSESSED WITH ROCKS YOU KNOW 
AND WHEN WE SAID EMERALD I SUSPECT HE SAID IT FIRST 
IT DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE WE JUST KNEW IMMEDIATELY THAT WAS THE NAME 
HOW LONG DID SHE KNOW HER DAD FOR 
SHE WAS THREE WHEN HE DIED 
YOU'VE BROUGHT HER UP ON YOUR OWN SINCE THEN 
SO THAT MUST BE QUITE TOUGH 
IT IS SHE'S A GREAT GIRL YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB 
THANK YOU I HOPE SO 
SHE DOES SEEM TO BE A HAPPY GIRL 
THERE'S A LOT OF SADNESS WE MISS HER DAD A LOT 
WE KEEP HIS MEMORY ALIVE AS YOU CAN TELL FROM BEING HERE 
BUT THEY DID HAVE THREE REALLY SPECIAL YEARS TOGETHER 
SO AT LEAST THEY'VE GOT THAT 
WE HAVE A LOT OF OLD MOVIE FOOTAGE AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
BUT YES IT IS TOUGH IT'S VERY TOUGH BEING A SINGLE MUM 
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE 
BUT IT HAS ITS OWN SPECIAL THING BECAUSE IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US 
IT MAKES US VERY CLOSE 
I'M FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR ASHLEY 
WHO CLEARLY WANTS TO MAKE SURE HER DAUGHTER HAS A WONDERFUL CHILDHOOD 
SO WE GET RUMMAGING AGAIN 
MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER TO FIND ENOUGH VALUABLES 
SO THEY CAN ENJOY ANOTHER GREAT HOLIDAY TOGETHER 
AND IT'S EMERALD WHO FINDS OUR NEXT TREASURE 
AN ECCLESIASTICAL VICTORIAN SILVER CHALICE 
WITH AN ESTIMATE OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THAT SHOULD REALLY LIFT OUR SPIRITS 
THEN THERE'S THIS FOLDING PEMBROKE TABLE IN MAHOGANY 
THAT COULD BRING IN ANYWHERE BETWEEN FIFTY AND ONE HUNDRED 
UPSTAIRS OUR OWN LITTLE TREASURE PAUL HAS UNEARTHED ANOTHER PROMISING FIND 
AH ASHLEY EMERALD 
HERE WE ARE A NICE LITTLE JEWELLERY BOX IS THAT A FAMILY HEIRLOOM 
NO I BOUGHT THAT ACTUALLY WHEN WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT ONE OR TWO ONE AND A HALF 
I BROUGHT IT HOME WITH GLEE IT WAS MY NEW JEWELLERY BOX SHE POUNCED ON IT 
SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A PRESENT FOR HER IT ALL OPENS OUT 
AND SHE WOULD PUT HER TOYS IN HERE AND USE THIS AS A LADDER 
AND THEN THEY'D BE LIKE BUNKBEDS 
SHE'D ARRANGE THEM SO THEY'D ALL SLEEP IN THERE 
D'YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE YOUR THINKING 
NEXT TIME I GET ONE OF THESE 
I'M GOING TO USE THAT AS A SALES TACTIC 
IT COULD BE A DOLL'S HOUSE COULDN'T IT 
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS A JEWELLERY BOX 
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN KEPT LOCKED AWAY REALLY 
HAVE A LOCK AND KEY ON THE FRONT 
AND IN HERE WOULD BE YOUR COSTUME JEWELLERY 
THE UNUSUAL THING ABOUT THIS ONE IS IT'S MADE OF LEATHER 
THAT'S QUITE A RARE THING TO FIND 
MOST OF THESE JEWELLERY BOXES TEND TO BE JUST ORDINARY WOODEN CABINETS 
BUT THIS ONE IS BEAUTIFULLY FINISHED IT'S IN GOOD CONDITION 
I WOULD EXPECT BY NOW TO HAVE A PART MISSING 
OR ONE OF THE DRAWERS MISSING OR A FRONT 
BUT THIS ONE'S ACTUALLY O. K. 
SO THAT MUST BE WORTH FIFTY TO EIGHTY DOES THAT SOUND O. K. 
THAT'LL DO WON'T IT DOES THAT SOUND O. K. WITH YOU YES 
FROM ONE JEWEL TO ANOTHER LET'S KEEP LOOKING O. K. 
MY MEMORIES ARE OF EMERALD USING IT FOR HER DOLLS AND HER TOYS 
AND MAKING IT INTO BUNKBEDS AND THINKING IT WAS HERS 
IT WAS VERY SWEET REALLY 
BUT SHE'S LONG OUTGROWN THOSE SORT OF GAMES 
AND IT SEEMS THAT IF IT'S WORTH A FEW POUNDS THEN WE SHOULD LET IT GO 
THAT'S THE SPIRIT ASHLEY WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL 
BUT WITH A LITTLE GIRL'S HOPES AND WISHES RESTING WITH US WE NEED TO KEEP ON RUMMAGING 
LUCKILY THIS HOUSE IS FULL OF SURPRISES 
NO MORE SO THAN THIS LENGTH OF WORKTOP 
BOUGHT BY ASHLEY'S LATE HUSBAND GILES 
IT CONTAINS REAL FOSSILS 
AND PAUL VALUES IT AT ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED 
ALSO OFF TO AUCTION IS THIS INTRICATELY CARVED DUTCH WALL HANGING DISPLAY CABINET 
VALUED BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME AND WITH A WHOPPING ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TARGET 
WE NEED AN IMPRESSIVE LAST FIND 
PAUL MAY HAVE FOUND JUST THE THING 
ASHLEY IS THIS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE SOLD THIS CABINET 
ER YES INDEED 
WHERE'S THAT COME FROM 
WELL IT WAS A GIFT ACTUALLY 
GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND HE SAID THAT IT WAS MADE FROM ROSEWOOD 
AND THAT HE THOUGHT IT HAD SPENT SOME TIME IN INDIA 
OR IT HAD BEEN MADE THERE I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY 
WELL THIS IS ACTUALLY ENGLISH AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE WORK OF A GUY CALLED EDWARD GODWIN 
HAVE YOU HEARD OF HIM YES I HAVE ACTUALLY 
HE WAS AN ARCHITECT HE WAS FRIENDS WITH OSCAR WILDE 
HE WAS MARRIED TO ELLEN TERRY YOU KNOW THE FAMOUS ACTRESS 
AND ONE OF THE ARTISTS HE HAD WORKING FOR HIM 
WAS NONE OTHER THAN WHISTLER THE GUY WHO PAINTED HIS MOTHER 
WELL HE PAINTED PANELS FOR HIM 
WE DO KNOW WHERE MOST OF HIS WORK IS IT'S IN MUSEUMS OR IN GALLERIES 
THERE'S A COUPLE OF DRAWINGS IN THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM 
A COUPLE OF PIECES IN BIG STATELY HOMES 
BUT TO FIND ONE IN A HOUSE IT'S PRETTY AMAZING REALLY WOW 
AND I THINK VALUE WISE EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED 
GREAT AND CONSIDERING IT WAS A GIFT WELL WHAT A RESULT 
I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL EMERALD THAT SEE WHAT SHE SAYS EMERALD LORNE 
YES YOU CALLED 
WE CAN ADD A HUGE AMOUNT TO THE TOTAL 
THIS CABINET IS WORTH AT LEAST EIGHT HUNDRED 
WOW THAT'S NOT A BAD RESULT IS IT 
WELL WE'RE NOT SPENDING THE WHOLE EIGHT HUNDRED ON YOUR PARTY 
YOU KNOW THAT DON'T YOU 
THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING TO AUCTION COMES TO ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY 
THAT'S NOT BAD AT ALL IS IT 
THE NEXT TIME YOU'LL SEE ALL YOUR WONDERFUL THINGS 
WILL BE WHEN THEY'RE ABOUT TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
WE HAVE HAD A GREAT DAY HERE WITH THE GIRLS AND UNEARTHED SOME REAL VALUABLE PIECES 
AMONG THE ITEMS HEADING OFF TO AUCTION ARE 
THE TRIANG PRAM THAT COST ASHLEY JUST A FEW POUNDS AT A CAR BOOT SALE 
A STUNNING DIAMOND BROOCH THAT BELONGED TO ASHLEY'S GRANDMOTHER 
THE EXQUISITE DIAMOND SAFE BOX 
WHICH WILL HOPEFULLY CATCH THE EYE OF A JEWELLERY DEALER 
AND FINALLY THIS REMARKABLE AND UNIQUE CABINET THAT MAY WELL BE THE WORK 
OF A NOTED VICTORIAN DESIGNER WHO WAS FRIENDS WITH BOTH WHISTLER AND OSCAR WILDE 
STILL TO COME ON CASH IN THE ATTIC 
THE GIRLS FIND OUT THAT AUCTIONS HAVE THEIR UPS 
YES ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
AND THEIR DOWNS 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
DISAPPOINTED 
ANNOYED 
WILL THEY GET THEIR HOLIDAY FIND OUT WHEN THE HAMMER FALLS 
WELL IT'S BEEN A FEW WEEKS SINCE WE HAD A GOOD LOOK AROUND ASHLEY AND EMERALD'S HOME IN SOUTH WEST LONDON 
AND WE FOUND PLENTY OF LOVELY THINGS TO BRING HERE TO EWBANK AUCTION HOUSE IN SURREY 
NOW REMEMBER THEY'RE LOOKING TO RAISE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TOWARDS A HOLIDAY 
AND ALSO AN ICE SKATING TRIP FOR EMERALD 
SO LET'S JUST HOPE TODAY THAT WHEN OUR ITEMS GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
THE BIDDERS KEEP US RIGHT ON TRACK 
THIS AUCTION HOUSE IN SURREY ATTRACTS A WIDE VARIETY OF DEALERS AND ENTHUSIASTS 
WHO ARE ALREADY CHECKING OUT THE FANTASTIC SELECTION OF COLLECTIBLES ON SALE TODAY

LET'S HOPE YOU CAN FEATHER YOUR NEST TODAY WITH ALL THESE ITEMS 
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO SEE YOUR STUFF ACTUALLY HERE IN SITU 
IT'S ODD YOU WALK IN AND YOU SEE THINGS THAT FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG TO US AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE 
I WAS GOING TO PUT MY CUP OF TEA ON THE GODWIN 
I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT 
ITEMS LIKE THIS ARE VERY RARE 
AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS LOOK AFTER YOU 
AND I'VE SUGGESTED THAT WE PUT AN EIGHT HUNDRED RESERVE ON THIS PIECE TODAY 
AND WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND IS IT MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY SELL HERE TODAY 
BUT WE COULD TRY SOMEWHERE ELSE A FINE ART SALE AND TRY AGAIN 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT ASHLEY 
WELL IT FEELS LIKE I'M BEING LOOKED AFTER IF PAUL REALLY BELIEVES THAT IT SHOULD SELL FOR MORE MONEY 
ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR ICE SKATING TRIP

ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO IS MAKE YOU SOME MONEY SO WE CAN PAY FOR IT

IT'S A BUSY AUCTION HOUSE FULL OF COLLECTIBLES AND LOTS OF POTENTIAL BIDDERS 
WHICH IS A GOOD JOB AS WE HAVE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO RAISE

GOES UNDER THE HAMMER WITH A MODEST FORTY TO SEVENTY ESTIMATE 
NO I'LL PASS THE LOT IF I CAN'T GET THIRTY FOR IT 
I'LL PASS THE LOT 
IT FAILS TO FIND A SINGLE BIDDER 
WHICH MEANS ASHLEY AND EMERALD WILL BE TAKING IT HOME WITH THEM 
IT WAS EMERALD WHO CALLED IN CASH IN THE ATTIC 
AND SHE DESPERATELY WANTS TO RAISE MONEY FOR HER PARTY 
AND AN ADVENTUROUS HOLIDAY WITH HER MUM 
AUCTIONS CAN BE A REAL ROLLERCOASTER OF EMOTIONS FOR ANYONE LET ALONE SOMEONE SO YOUNG

LAST CHANCE AT TWENTY THANK YOU 
NOW I'M REALLY SAD 
POOR EMERALD HER PRAM HAS GONE BUT AT ONLY HALF THE FORTY ESTIMATE 
AND SHE'S CLEARLY NOT A HAPPY BUNNY

EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON OUR FINAL LOT 
THE GODWIN STYLE CABINET
