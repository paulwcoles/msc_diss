THE GRANDEUR OF THEIR CASTLES 
THE BEAUTY OF THEIR CATHEDRALS 
BUT MEDIEVAL IDEAS ARE LESS FAMILIAR TERRITORY 
WHO WERE THESE PEOPLE WHO LIVED ONE THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND BUILT 
THESE EXTRAORDINARY BUILDINGS AND DID THESE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS 
HOW DID THEY UNDERSTAND THE WORLD WHAT DID THEY FEEL 
AND ABOVE ALL WHAT DID THEY BELIEVE 
BETWEEN THE TENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES THE WEST WAS DOMINATED BY RELIGIOUS 
AND SUPERNATURAL BELIEFS IN A WAY THAT IS HARD FOR US TO IMAGINE 
PEOPLE SAW THE WORLD THROUGH THE PRISM OF THOSE BELIEFS 
IT WAS A WORLD TOUCHED BY DIVINE SIGNIFICANCE 
ENCHANTED UNCERTAIN 
UNPREDICTABLE 
THIS WAS A WORLD IN WHICH 
SOME BOUNDARIES WERE LESS CLEAR THAN THEY ARE TODAY 
BOUNDARIES WERE BLURRED BETWEEN THE NATURAL AND THE SUPERNATURAL 
BETWEEN THE ORDINARY AND THE MIRACULOUS 
BETWEEN THE LIVING AND THE DEAD 
MEDIEVAL RECORDS EVOKE A TIME WHEN THE DEAD WERE ALWAYS WITH US 
THE ABBOT OF THE MONASTERY OF BURTON ON TRENT RECORDED 
AN UNCANNY SERIES OF EVENTS WHICH OCCURRED AROUND ONE THOUSAND NINETY 
THERE WERE TWO VILLAGERS LIVING IN STAPENHILL 
WHO RAN AWAY TO THE NEIGHBOURING VILLAGE 
THE VERY NEXT DAY AT THE THIRD HOUR THEY WERE SUDDENLY STRUCK DOWN DEAD 
SOON AFTER THEIR CORPSES WERE BURIED 
WORD CAME OF TWO ALIEN BEINGS ROAMING THE WOODS 
NOW THEY APPEARED IN THE SHAPE OF MEN CARRYING WOODEN COFFINS ON THEIR SHOULDERS 
NOW IN THE LIKENESS OF BEARS OR DOGS 
THE VILLAGERS WERE IN MORTAL TERROR OF THE TWO PHANTOM DEAD MEN WHO ROAMED THE COUNTRYSIDE AT NIGHT 
THE BISHOP AUTHORISED THE VILLAGERS TO DIG UP THE BODIES 
THE LINEN CLOTHS OVER THEIR FACES WERE STAINED WITH BLOOD 
THEY CUT OFF THE MEN'S HEADS AND PUT THEM IN THE GRAVES BETWEEN THEIR LEGS 
TORE OUT THEIR HEARTS FROM THEIR CORPSES AND BURNED THEM 
WHEN THE HEARTS HAD AT LAST BEEN BURNED UP THEY CRACKED WITH A GREAT SOUND 
EVERYONE THERE SAW AN EVIL SPIRIT IN THE FORM OF A CROW FLY FROM THE FLAMES 
SOON AFTER THIS WAS DONE BOTH THE DISEASE AND THE PHANTOM CEASED 
THESE RECORDS SHOW THIS REMARKABLE STORY 
WITH ITS WALKING DEAD AND BLOOD STAINED SHROUDS WAS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY 
THIS WAS NO IDLE GHOST STORY DREAMED UP TO PASS AWAY AN EVENING 
BY THE FIRE BUT A REMINDER OF A PRESSING REALITY 
THAT THE DEAD DID NOT DISAPPEAR INTO DUST BUT COULD OCCUPY THE SAME WORLD AS THE LIVING 
COUNTLESS SIMILAR REPORTS SUGGEST THE DEAD WERE AN INSISTENT PRESENCE 
HEREFORDSHIRE IN THE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTIES 
THE CORPSE OF A WICKED MAN WANDERS THE ROADS AT NIGHT 
CALLING OUT THE NAMES OF VILLAGERS WHO SICKEN AND DIE 
IN ANNANDALE SCOTLAND A CORPSE ROAMS THE VILLAGES SPREADING THE PLAGUE WITH HIS FOUL BREATH 
IN THE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETIES IN BUCKINGHAMSHIRE A DEAD MAN RETURNS TO HIS WIDOW'S BE ALMOST CRUSHING HER WITH HIS WEIGHT 
SUCH HORROR STORIES WERE TAKEN AS FACT BY CHRONICLERS SUCH AS WILLIAM OF NEWBURGH 
ONE WOULD NOT EASILY BELIEVE THAT CORPSES COME OUT OF THEIR GRAVES 
AND WANDER AROUND TO TERRORISE THE LIVING 
WERE THERE NOT SO MANY CASES SUPPORTED BY AMPLE TESTIMONY 
AT THE TIME OF THESE UNCANNY HAPPENINGS 
REBURYING THE BODIES OF THESE RESTLESS SOULS WAS NOT UNCOMMON 
EXCAVATIONS OF MEDIEVAL CEMETERIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE REVEALED CORPSES BURIED IN AN UNUSUAL WAY 
WITH THE HEAD REMOVED AND PLACED BETWEEN THE LEGS 
JUST LIKE IN THE STORY 
TO PREVENT THE DEAD FROM EVER WALKING AGAIN 
THE MEDIEVAL DEAD SHARED THE WORLD WITH THE LIVING 
AND THEY COULD BE ENCOUNTERED AT ANY TIME 
ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MEDIEVAL FOLK TALES IS THE STORY OF THE THREE LIVING AND THE THREE DEAD 
THREE RICH YOUNG MEN ARE OUT WALKING WHEN THEY MEET THREE DEAD MEN 
THE DEAD MEN EACH IN VARYING STAGES OF DECOMPOSITION 
HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL THE RICH YOUNG MEN 
BEWARE THEY SAY 
SUCH AS YOU ARE SO WERE WE 
SUCH AS I AM SO WILL YOU BE 
THEY CHIDE THEM FOR THEIR LOVE OF WORLDLY THINGS 
WEALTH HONOUR AND POWER THEY SAY 
ARE OF NO VALUE AT THE HOUR OF YOUR DEATH 
YOUR TIME AMONG THE LIVING WAS OFTEN DESCRIBED AS BRIEFER THAN THE BLINK OF AN EYE 
WHAT MATTERED WAS THE HOUR OF YOUR DEATH 
THE CROSSING INTO THE NEXT WORLD 
WHEN YOU TOO MIGHT BECOME LIKE ONE OF THE THREE DEAD 
WANDERING THE EARTH 
WARNING THE LIVING TO PREPARE FOR WHAT LAY IN STORE 
AND THIS TRAFFIC BETWEEN THE LIVING AND THE DEAD WAS TWO WAY 
JUST AS PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT THE DEAD MIGHT VISIT THE LIVING 
SO THEY BELIEVED THAT THE LIVING MIGHT VISIT THE DEAD 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIX IN THE QUIET COUNTRYSIDE OF ESSEX 
A PEASANT CALLED THURKILL FROM THE VILLAGE OF STISTED WAS WORKING IN THE FIELDS 
AN ACCIDENT LEFT HIM IN A DEEP COMA 
FOR TWO DAYS HE LAY AS IF DEAD 
WHEN HE REVIVED HE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY TO TELL 
TO WHAT ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE WAS AN ASTONISHED AUDIENCE 
HE RECOUNTED EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED WHILE HIS BODY HAD BEEN OUT COLD 
WHAT HE DESCRIBED WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A JOURNEY TO THE NEXT WORLD AND BACK 
HE GAVE HIS LISTENERS A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE AFTERLIFE 
THURKILL DESCRIBES HOW HE FIRST COMES TO A MYSTERIOUS CHURCH UNLIKE ANY ON EARTH 
TO THE NORTH THERE IS A WALL ABOUT SIX FEET HIGH 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CHURCH IS A FONT FROM WHICH A BRIGHT FLAME EMERGES 
THURKILL TELLS HOW ALL AROUND HIM EVIL SPIRITS COME LEAPING TO MEET HIM 
CACKLING TO ONE ANOTHER 
THIS IS WHERE THE SOULS OF THE DEAD WENT TO BE WEIGHED SOME TO BE DAMNED AND SUCKED INTO HELL 
THEY SCREAMED AND CURSED THEIR MOTHER AND FATHER WHO BORE THEM FOR ETERNAL TORMENT 
THE SAVED ARE LED STRAIGHT THROUGH THE JEWELLED GATES TO THE CHURCH OF GOLD 
AS FOR THE REST OF US OUR FATE WAS TO SERVE OUT OUR TIME IN WHAT WAS CALLED PURGATORY 
THE AGONISING WAITING ROOM FOR HEAVEN 
A PLACE WHERE YOUR SINS WERE PURGED HENCE ITS NAME 
AND THE GREATER YOUR SINS THE LONGER YOUR WAIT 
THEN THURKILL PASSES THROUGH FIRE AND ACROSS A BRIDGE OF NAILS AND SPIKES 
IT'S HERE AMONG THE HUDDLED SINNERS 
THAT HE CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF A SHADOWY FIGURE 
IT'S HIS FATHER HIDEOUSLY EMACIATED AND MONSTROUSLY DEFORMED IN PAIN 
HIS FATHER STRUGGLES TO TELL HIM HOW HE'S LANGUISHING HERE BECAUSE OF HIS SHADY BUSINESS DEALS 
THURKILL HEARS THE VOICE OF SAINT MICHAEL 
TEN MASSES WILL FREE YOUR FATHER 
AND THEN YOU CAN ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE CHURCH ON THE MOUNT OF GLORY 
THURKILL NEVER EVEN GLIMPSES HIS MOTHER 
HAS SHE BEEN DAMNED TO SUFFER ETERNITY IN HELL 
TO THE ESSEX VILLAGERS THURKILL'S VISION WOULD HAVE SOUNDED CHILLINGLY FAMILIAR 
THIS WAS A JOURNEY WHICH AWAITED THEM ALL 
AND THIS VERY EXACT DESCRIPTION OF THE AFTERLIFE WAS NOT AN ISOLATED RECORD 
SUCH VISIONS WERE FREQUENT IN MEDIEVAL ENGLAND 
AND MANY OF THEM FOLLOWED THE PATTERN OF THURKILL'S 
WITH TORMENTS DESIGNED FOR PARTICULAR SINS 
LIKE GLUTTONS BEING FORCED TO STARVE OR MISERS HAVING GOLD POURED DOWN THEIR THROATS 
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT WAS AN EVERYDAY REALITY 
SUCH STORIES WERE WIDELY DISCUSSED AND REPEATED FROM PULPITS THROUGHOUT THE LAND 
JUST SUCH A VISION OF A JOURNEY THROUGH THE NEXT WORLD 
IS THE SUBJECT OF ONE OF THE GREATEST WORKS IN THE WHOLE OF MEDIEVAL LITERATURE 
DANTE'S DIVINE COMEDY 
HELL IS A NIGHTMARE OF ENDLESS TORMENT 
PURGATORY IS A MOUNTAIN WHERE THE LESS SINFUL SERVE OUT 
THEIR ALLOTTED TIME BEFORE THEY JOIN GOD IN THE SPHERES OF HEAVEN 
THE DEAD COULD VISIT THE LIVING THE LIVING COULD HELP THE DEAD 
THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN THESE WORLDS WERE PERMEABLE 
FOR LIFE ON THIS EARTH WAS JUST A FRACTION OF OUR ETERNAL EXISTENCE 
THE REAL WORLD WAS NOT THIS ONE BUT THE NEXT 
CONSTANTLY MOVING BETWEEN THESE TWO WORLDS WAS A RACE OF SPIRIT BEINGS 
GOOD AND EVIL 
LEADING THE FORCES OF DARKNESS WAS THE DEVIL SATAN 
A FORMER ANGEL CAST OUT OF HEAVEN 
WHO WAS IMPLACABLY OPPOSED TO GOD AND HIS CREATION 
THE DEVIL AND HIS BATTALION OF DEMONS WERE EVERYWHERE 
TO TEMPT YOU BEGUILE YOU DESTROY YOU 
THE DEVIL MIGHT APPEAR IN ALL SORTS OF FORMS 
PERHAPS IN THE FORM OF A TOAD 
OR A BLACK DOG 
OR A CROW 
ANYTHING FRIGHTENING 
ANYTHING UNUSUAL 
ANYTHING THAT NEVERTHELESS YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER EVERY DAY 
IN THE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTIES THERE WAS A MAN CALLED WILLIAM OF ABERDEEN A SAILOR 
WHO WAS WALKING ON THE SCOTTISH MOORS 
HE NOTICED THAT A LITTLE DOG WAS FOLLOWING HIM 
SUDDENLY THE DOG INCREASED ENORMOUSLY IN SIZE 
AND TURNED INTO A DRAGON 
WILLIAM BECAME POSSESSED BY A DEMON 
HE TORE OFF ALL HIS CLOTHES APART FROM HIS BREECHES AND WENT DOWN INTO THE TOWN OF DUNFERMLINE 
AT THE DEVIL'S INSTIGATION HE TRIED TO DO MANY WICKED THINGS THERE 
HE FORCED INDOORS THE LITTLE CHILDREN AND MAIDENS THE OLD AND THE YOUNG 
AND TRIED TO BREAK DOWN THEIR DOORS AROUND THEM WITH A MIGHTY SHARP AXE 
EVENTUALLY HE WAS DISARMED TIED UP 
TAKEN INTO THE LOCAL SHRINE THE MONASTERY OF SAINT MARGARET 
HE WAS THERE FOR THREE DAYS HOWLING AND WAILING NOT EATING ANYTHING 
UNTIL EVENTUALLY HE RETURNED TO HIS SENSES 
THE MONKS GAVE HIM SOME BREAD AND CHEESE HE CONFESSED HIS SINS AND THE DEMON LEFT HIM 
BUT MEDIEVAL MEN AND WOMEN WERE NOT ALONE IN THEIR FIGHT AGAINST THE DEMON WORLD 
A HEAVENLY ARMY OF ANGELS STOOD READY TO FIGHT ON THEIR BEHALF 
NINE ORDERS OF THEM 
FROM SERAPHIM AND CHERUBIM DOWN TO ARCHANGELS AND MERE ANGELS EACH WITH HIS ALLOTTED ROLE 
THE PRIEST GERALD OF WALES DESCRIBED THEIR PLACE IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS 
THEY HAVE A MORE SUBTLE ESSENCE THAN MAN A HIGHER LOCATION AND A MORE INTIMATE FAMILIARITY WITH GOD 
ANGELS AND DEMONS BATTLED CONSTANTLY FOR POSSESSION OF OUR SOULS 
THE ANGELS DISPLAY ENDLESS CARE FOR OUR WELL BEING 
THE DEMONS MAKE FIERCE ATTACKS UPON US TO COMPEL US TO SURRENDER 
AROUND ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TEN WILLIAM OF CORBEIL SAW THIS BATTLE 
AT FIRST HAND IN HIS HOUSE IN DOVER 
AS I LAY GRAVELY ILL A CROWD OF HIDEOUS DEMONS RUSHED IN 
AND SAT AROUND MY SICKBED GLOATING OVER WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH ME 
BUT THEN WILLIAM BECAME AWARE OF A PRESENCE AT HIS BEDSIDE 
THE VIRGIN MARY 
HE WAS STILL TERRIFIED BUT THE VIRGIN INSISTED THE DEMONS COULDN'T TAKE HIM 
SHE TOLD THEM THE ANGELS MICHAEL GABRIEL AND RAPHAEL WOULD FIGHT THEM 
THE DEMONS SLUNK OFF GRUMBLING THAT THEY WOULDN'T TAKE THEM ON 
WILLIAM WAS SAVED 
BUT AT ANY MOMENT ANYONE'S LIFE COULD BE TRANSFORMED 
FOR BETTER OR WORSE BY THESE SPIRITUAL BEINGS 
WOULD SUCH IDEAS HAVE GENERATED ANXIETY OR REASSURANCE 
PROBABLY BOTH AT DIFFERENT TIMES 
BUT WHATEVER THE ANSWER THERE WAS NOTHING BIZARRE ABOUT DIVINE INTERVENTION 
IT WAS JUST PART OF HOW THINGS WERE 
THE MOST SPECTACULAR OF ALL DIVINE INTERVENTIONS WOULD BE THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 
THE APOCALYPSE ITSELF 
WHEN ALL THIS WORLD WOULD BE DESTROYED AND THE DEAD WOULD RISE AGAIN 
WHEN WOULD THIS HAPPEN EXACTLY 
MEDIEVAL SCHOLARS CALCULATED THAT MAN WAS LIVING IN THE SIXTH AND FINAL AGE 
SO FOR PEOPLE AT THE TIME THE MIDDLE AGES WERE NOT THE MIDDLE AGES 
IT WAS THE END OF TIME 
THE END OF THE WORLD APPROACHING VISITS FROM THE WALKING DEAD 
FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS OF JOURNEYS TO THE AFTERLIFE 
INVISIBLE BATTLES BETWEEN ANGELS AND DEMONS 
THE SUPERNATURAL HAD NOTHING ABSTRACT ABOUT IT 
IT WAS REAL AND IT WAS ALL AROUND 
THE ONLY MEDIATOR BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT WAS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL FORCES IN HISTORY 
THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH 
THE SOARING CATHEDRALS OF THE MIDDLE AGES PROTECTED THE SOULS 
OF MEN AND WOMEN AGAINST EVIL INTERVENTIONS FROM THE WORLD BEYOND 
GOD'S POWER WAS MADE MANIFEST IN STONE 
THE CHURCH OWNED ONE FIFTH OF THE WEALTH OF THE COUNTRY 
IT TOOK ONE TENTH OF THE INCOME OF ALL CHRISTIANS 
IN RETURN IT CAST A PROTECTIVE SHIELD AROUND THE FAITHFUL 
TO SAY THIS WAS A RELIGIOUS AGE DOESN'T EVEN GET CLOSE 
IN MODERN WESTERN SOCIETIES RELIGION IS A MATTER OF CHOICE 
GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO INTERVENE ON BEHALF OF ONE RELIGION AGAINST ANOTHER 
IN THE UNITED STATES THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE IS EVEN WRITTEN INTO THE CONSTITUTION 
SUCH IDEAS WOULD HAVE BEEN INCOMPREHENSIBLE IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
THEN THE CHURCH WAS NOT AN ASSOCIATION 
OF LIKE MINDED INDIVIDUALS GETTING TOGETHER BY CHOICE 
IT WAS THE VERY FRAMEWORK OF SOCIETY ITSELF 
IT WAS THE VERY FRAMEWORK OF SOCIETY ITSELF 
THE FRONT LINE OF DEFENCE AGAINST THE FORCES OF EVIL WERE THE GREAT MEDIEVAL MONASTERIES 
BY THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY THERE WERE AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND RELIGIOUS HOUSES IN ENGLAND ALONE 
MANY WERE BUILT IN REMOTE SITES ECHOING CHRIST'S STRUGGLE WITH SATAN IN THE WILDERNESS 
PLUSCARDEN ABBEY NEAR INVERNESS IS THE ONLY MEDIEVAL MONASTERY 
IN BRITAIN STILL USED FOR ITS ORIGINAL PURPOSE 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY THE MONK ORDERIC VITALIS 
DESCRIBED THE ROLE OF THE MONASTERIES IN THE ARMY OF GOD 
HERE CHRIST'S GARRISONS REJECT THE WORLD AND ITS PARASITES 
SCORNING ALL ITS PLEASURES AS FILTH 
TO STRUGGLE MANFULLY AGAINST THE DEVIL 
MONKS HERE FOLLOW THE RULE OF SAINT BENEDICT FORMULATED IN THE SIXTH CENTURY 
THE ESSENCE OF THE BENEDICTINE RULE IS THE SEARCH FOR GOD 
IN AN ORDERED AND COMMUNITY LIFE 
WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON PRAYER READING AND WORK 
LIVING BY A RULE LIVING UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF AN ABBOT 
LIVING A DEDICATED CELIBATE CHRISTIAN LIFE 
THE MONKS' DAY STARTS AT FOUR IN THE MORNING 
AND FOLLOWS A PATTERN SCARCELY CHANGED SINCE THE MIDDLE AGES 
FOR THEIR MEDIEVAL PREDECESSORS SUCH A ROUTINE FORMED PART OF AN UNREMITTING WAR 
A MONASTERY IS A CASTLE BUILT AGAINST SATAN 
WHERE THE COWLED CHAMPIONS ENGAGE IN CEASELESS COMBAT AGAINST THE DEVIL 
THE MONK IS ENGAGED IN A STRUGGLE WITH ALL THAT IS 
SELF CENTRED IN HIMSELF OR WITH THE 
THE FORCES OF EVIL IF YOU LIKE WITHIN HIMSELF 
SO IN THAT SENSE YES AND THAT IS THE IDEA OF A SPIRITUAL COMBAT 
IT IS A VERY ANCIENT ONE GOING BACK TO THE DESERT FATHERS 
BEYOND THE WALLS OF THESE CASTLES BUILT AGAINST SATAN WERE THE LOCAL GARRISONS THE PARISH CHURCHES 
THE MEDIEVAL CHURCHES STOOD GUARD OVER THE SOUL 
OF EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD 
AS GOD'S INTERMEDIARIES PRIESTS ADMINISTERED THE SACRAMENTS 
MARKING THE KEY STAGES ON THE DANGEROUS JOURNEY FROM BIRTH TO DEATH 
FIRST BAPTISM 
A FORM OF EXORCISM CASTING OUT THE DEVIL 
THEN CONFESSION 
COMMUNION 
MARRIAGE 
AND FINALLY THEY PRESIDED OVER BURIAL 
THE MOST DRAMATIC RITE OF PASSAGE OF ALL 
THE MEDIEVAL DEAD REMAINED IN OUR MIDST 
THEY WERE OUR LINK WITH THE NEXT WORLD 
THE MINGLING OF THE LIVING AND THE DEAD IS UNUSUAL 
IN ANCIENT GREECE AND ROME IT WAS FORBIDDEN TO BURY CORPSES IN THE TOWN 
MEDIEVAL CHRISTIANITY BROUGHT THEM IN 
EVERY PARISH CHURCH WAS BUILT WITH A CEMETERY 
GO INTO A SYNAGOGUE OR A MOSQUE OR A BUDDHIST OR HINDU TEMPLE 
YOU DON'T SEE MEMORIALS AND TOMBSTONES 
EVERY PARISH CHURCH IS FULL OF THEM 
WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED BUT IT'S ACTUALLY PART OF 
WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE CULT OF THE DEAD 
THE TOMBS OF THE DEAD REMINDED EVERYONE RICH AND POOR 
THAT THIS WORLD WAS NOT THEIR REAL HOME 
IN MEDIEVAL CHANTRY CHAPELS THE WEALTHY INVESTED IN MAGNIFICENT TOMBS 
TO HELP SHORTEN THEIR TIME IN PURGATORY 
THIS IS THE TOMB OF RICHARD BEAUCHAMP EARL OF WARWICK 
ONE OF THE RICHEST AND MOST POWERFUL MEN IN ENGLAND 
WHEN HE DIED IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY NINE HE LEFT MONEY FOR FIVE THOUSAND MASSES TO BE SAID FOR HIS SOUL 
BUT HIS REAL SAFETY NET AGAINST THE PAINS OF PURGATORY WAS THIS CHAPEL 
BUILT IN THE TWENTY YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH COSTING THOUSANDS OF POUNDS THE EQUIVALENT OF MILLIONS NOWADAYS 
WHERE HE HOPED IN HIS OWN WORDS THAT PRAYERS WOULD BE SAID FOR HIM UNTIL THE END OF TIME 
THE EFFIGY OF RICHARD BEAUCHAMP IS FROZEN FOR ETERNITY 
HIS HANDS OPEN IN PRAYER AND VENERATION TO THE VIRGIN MARY 
WHO GAZES DOWN ON HIM FROM THE VAULTED CEILING ABOVE 
AROUND THE SIDES OF THE TOMB STATUES KNOWN AS WEEPERS 
FAMILY MEMBERS MOURNING HIS DEATH AND PRAYING FOR HIS ASCENT INTO THE ARMS OF GOD 
IN THIS WORLD MONKS AND PRIESTS PRAY FOR THE DEAD 
HELPING TO SHORTEN THEIR TIME OF TORMENT IN THE LABYRINTH OF PURGATORY 
IN THE SAME WAY THE HOLY DEAD THE SAINTS IN HEAVEN WERE BUSY 
OFFERING THEIR HELP TO THE LIVING 
PEOPLE VENERATED THE SAINTS 
MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAD LIVED 
ESPECIALLY HOLY LIVES OR PERFORMED MIRACLES 
THEY COULD DIRECTLY INTERVENE IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE LIVING 
SO THE CULT OF THE SAINTS WAS AT THE HEART OF MEDIEVAL LIFE 
EVERY PARISHIONER COULD SEE THE SAINTS FOR THEMSELVES ON THE SCREEN IN THE LOCAL CHURCH 
IT'S WHERE THEY CAME FACE TO FACE WITH THESE HEAVENLY BEINGS 
SOME SAINTS EVEN HAD A SPECIALITY 
PERHAPS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCIDENT IN THEIR OWN LIVES 
YOU PRAYED TO SAINT MARGARET OF ANTIOCH DURING CHILDBIRTH 
POSSIBLY BECAUSE SHE HAD EMERGED UNHARMED FROM THE BELLY OF THE DRAGON THAT HAD SWALLOWED HER 
SAINT APOLLONIA WAS THE PATRON SAINT OF TOOTHACHE 
SHE WAS A MARTYR SAINT WHO HAD BEEN TORTURED 
BY HAVING ALL HER TEETH PULLED OUT 
AND AS FOR SAINT WILGEFORTIS 
HER SPECIALITY WAS HELPING WIVES GET RID OF UNWANTED HUSBANDS 
SHE WAS ALSO CALLED SAINT UNCUMBER 
THE INTERVENTION OF A SAINT COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH 
EVEN CAUSING GOD TO REVISE HIS JUDGMENT 
IN MEDIEVAL TRIAL BY ORDEAL 
GOD REVEALED THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE OF A SUSPECT THROUGH THEIR REACTION TO AN EXCRUCIATING TEST 
IN THE TEST BY WATER IF THE ACCUSED FLOATED THEY WERE GUILTY 
IF THEY SANK THEY WERE INNOCENT AND QUICKLY HAULED OUT 
IN THE TEST BY FIRE 
THEY WERE GUILTY IF THEIR SKIN SWELLED UP INTO BLISTERS 
INNOCENT IF IT HEALED 
AROUND THE YEAR TWELVE HUNDRED A WOMAN IN YORK WAS ACCUSED OF MURDER 
AFTER THE WOMAN HAD CARRIED THE HOT IRON 
A SWELLING WAS DISCOVERED ON THE WOMAN'S HAND AS LARGE AS A WALNUT 
WHEREFORE SHE WAS CONDEMNED TO DEATH 
GOD HAD REVEALED HER GUILT 
BUT THE ACCUSED BEGGED PERMISSION TO PRAY AT THE TOMB OF SAINT WILLIAM 
AS SOON AS THE WOMAN ENTERED THE CHAPEL THE SWELLING DISAPPEARED WITHOUT TRACE 
THE JUSTICES PRONOUNCED HER INNOCENT SAYING THAT AS GOD AND SAINT WILLIAM 
HAD ABSOLVED HER THEY DID NOT WISH TO CONDEMN HER 
SAINTS WERE YOUR COMPANIONS GUIDING AND PROTECTING YOU 
THEIR AWESOME POWER WAS ESPECIALLY PRESENT IN THEIR PHYSICAL REMAINS 
SMALL PORTIONS OF THEIR BONE OR HAIR OR CLOTHING 
WERE FURIOUSLY COLLECTED AND GUARDED IN THE YEARS AND THE CENTURIES AFTER THEIR DEATHS 
BY PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED THAT THESE TANGIBLE OBJECTS RETAINED SUPERNATURAL POWER 
THESE REMAINS WERE CALLED RELICS 
THE WORD MEANS LITERALLY WHAT IS LEFT BEHIND 
OBJECTS OF SUPERNATURAL POWER 
THEY WERE TO BE APPROACHED WITH AWE EVEN TERROR 
THE MONK JOCELIN DE BRAKELOND IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT 
DESCRIBES HOW HE HELPED TO MOVE THE BODY OF THE MARTYR SAINT EDMUND 
TO THE HIGH ALTAR OF THE ABBEY CHURCH 
APPROACHING REVERENTLY WE MADE HASTE TO OPEN THE COFFIN 
THE ABBOT SAID HE LONGED TO GAZE UPON HIS PATRON 
BUT THE ABBOT APPROACHED THE THREE HUNDRED YEAR OLD BONES OF THE SAINT WITH TREPIDATION 
A PREVIOUS ABBOT HAD BEEN LEFT PARALYSED WHEN HE TOUCHED THE SAINT'S REMAINS 
WHILST THE REST OF THE ABBEY SLEPT HE CAREFULLY PEELED AWAY THE LAYERS OF SILK CLOTH COVERING THE BODY 
TAKING THE HEAD IN HIS HANDS HE UTTERED A PRAYER 
OH GLORIOUS MARTYR DO NOT CAST ME A MISERABLE SINNER 
INTO PERDITION FOR DARING TO TOUCH YOU 
YOU UNDERSTAND MY DEVOTION AND PURPOSE 
THIS TIME THE ABBOT WAS SPARED THE ANGER OF THE SAINT 
THE CORPSE REMAINED QUITE STILL 
THIS WAS THE CLOSEST YOU COULD GET TO ACTUALLY TOUCHING THE HOLY 
IT WAS NOT SOMETHING TO BE UNDERTAKEN LIGHTLY 
GETTING CLOSE TO DEAD SAINTS WAS A MEDIEVAL PASSION 
PILGRIMS TRAVELLED HUGE DISTANCES IN THE HOPE OF DOING SO 
TO ROME TO SANTIAGO IN SPAIN AND OF COURSE TO CANTERBURY 
AS CHAUCER WROTE OF HIS PILGRIMS WHEN SPRING COMES THEN PEOPLE LONG TO GO ON PILGRIMAGE 
THEY LONG TO GO THE ROADS OF MEDIEVAL BRITAIN WERE BUSY WITH PILGRIMS 
MEN AND WOMEN PREPARED TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES USUALLY ON FOOT 
TO GET CLOSE TO A RELIC OR TO PRAY AT A SHRINE 
ALONG THE PILGRIMS' WAY TO CANTERBURY WAS AYLESFORD PRIORY 
A FAVOURITE RESTING PLACE FOR MEDIEVAL TRAVELLERS 
THE PRIORY DATES BACK TO THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY AS A HOUSE 
OF THE CARMELITE ORDER OF FRIARS 
TODAY AYLESFORD HOUSES ONE OF THE FEW SURVIVING MEDIEVAL RELICS IN BRITAIN 
THE SKULL OF SAINT SIMON STOCK 
A VENERATED CARMELITE FRIAR HE HAD BEEN BLESSED WITH A VISION OF THE VIRGIN MARY 
MEDIEVAL EUROPE WAS FULL OF THEM THOUSANDS OF RELICS 
THE BONES THE PHYSICAL REMAINS OF THE SAINTS THE HOLY DEAD 
THE SAINTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN HEAVEN BUT THEY WERE ALSO HERE IN THEIR BONES IN THEIR RELICS 
YOU CAME TO THEM YOU PRAYED YOU TRIED TO GET AS CLOSE TO THEM AS YOU COULD 
YOU MIGHT EVEN BE HOPING FOR A MIRACULOUS CURE 
THE ROAD TO CANTERBURY LED THOUSANDS TO THE MOST VENERATED PILGRIM SITE IN BRITAIN 
IT WAS HERE IN THE CATHEDRAL THAT SAINT THOMAS BECKET 
HAD BEEN MURDERED BY THE SOLDIERS OF THE KING 
AS THEY ARRIVED PILGRIMS WERE OFFERED BOTTLES OF THE MARTYR'S BLOOD AS SOUVENIRS 
AND THERE WAS MUCH MORE HERE TO IMPRESS 
A LIST OF THE RELICS IN CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL IN THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTEEN 
INCLUDES TWELVE WHOLE BODIES OF SAINTS THREE HEADS TWELVE ARMS 
PIECES OF JESUS'S CROSS FORESKIN CRADLE AND TOMB 
AS WELL AS INNUMERABLE PIECES OF BONE HAIR AND BLOOD 
AS A PILGRIM YOU'D MAKE YOUR WAY AROUND THE CATHEDRAL 
UP THE STEPS TO THE MOST SACRED AREA OF THE CHURCH 
THIS WAS YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL 
THE SHRINE OF SAINT THOMAS OF CANTERBURY 
IT WOULD HAVE STOOD HERE ENCRUSTED WITH GOLD AND JEWELS 
CONTAINING THE REMAINS OF ENGLAND'S MOST FAMOUS SAINT 
A PLACE OF MIRACLE A CENTRE OF SUPERNATURAL POWER 
THE SHRINE OF SAINT THOMAS WAS DESIGNED TO STRIKE AWE INTO THE HEART OF THE MEDIEVAL PILGRIM 
AS WITH MANY SUCH SHRINES IT HAD OPENINGS IN THE SIDE 
TO ALLOW THE FAITHFUL TO REACH IN AND GET EVEN CLOSER TO THE RELIC 
LIKE A GIANT PICTURE BOOK THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS 
AROUND THE SHRINE TELL THE STORY OF THE MIRACLES OF SAINT THOMAS 
A TERRIFYING REMINDER THAT SAINTS COULD BE VENGEFUL AS WELL AS BENIGN 
IS SHOWN IN THE STORY OF THE KNIGHT JORDAN FITZ EISULF 
HIS HOUSEHOLD WAS STRUCK BY A DREADFUL DISEASE 
AMONGST THOSE WHO DIED WAS HIS YOUNGER SON 
JUST AT THIS TIME HE WAS VISITED BY PILGRIMS COMING FROM CANTERBURY 
CARRYING WITH THEM SOME OF THE HOLY WATER FROM SAINT THOMAS'S SHRINE 
HE THOUGHT HE'D GIVE IT A TRY 
HE POURED SOME OF THE HOLY WATER 
INTO THE BOY'S MOUTH THE BOY WAS MIRACULOUSLY REVIVED 
NATURALLY HE MADE A PROMISE TO GO ON A PILGRIMAGE OF THANKSGIVING TO SAINT THOMAS'S SHRINE AT CANTERBURY 
BUT WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER HE POSTPONED THAT PILGRIMAGE 
EVEN THOUGH THOMAS APPEARED IN A VISION REMINDING HIM 
EVENTUALLY SAINT THOMAS'S PATIENCE RAN OUT 
HE RETURNED AND KILLED THE KNIGHT'S OLDER SON 
THIS TIME OF COURSE JORDAN AND HIS FAMILY MADE THE PILGRIMAGE 
THOUSANDS CAME HERE HOPING FOR A MIRACLE 
AND THERE WAS NO SHORTAGE OF SUPPLY 
WHAT TODAY WE TAKE AS COINCIDENCE MIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AGES BE SEEN AS SOMETHING MIRACULOUS 
YOU HAD A BAD LEG OR A TOOTHACHE YOU WENT ON PILGRIMAGE TO PRAY FOR A CURE IT GOT BETTER 
AND THAT WOULD BE SEEN AS EVIDENCE OF DIVINE INTERVENTION 
MEDIEVAL PILGRIMAGE BECAME A HUGE INDUSTRY 
MONEY POURED IN FROM THE SALE OF BADGES AND SOUVENIRS 
AND FROM OFFERINGS LEFT AT THE SITE OF A SHRINE 
WITH MONEY CAME CORRUPTION 
EVEN FORGERY 
AROUND ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THE MUCH REVERED FRIAR WALTER OF SAINT EDMUNDS HAD RECENTLY BEEN BURIED 
ONE DAY A MAN CAME TO ONE OF THE FRIARS AND HE SAID HE COULD MAKE THEM RICH IF THEY WISHED 
WHEN ASKED HOW THE MAN EXPLAINED THAT FRIAR WALTER HAD A REPUTATION FOR SANCTITY 
AND IF A FEW MIRACLES HAPPENED AT HIS TOMB THAT COULD BRING IN A NICE INCOME FOR THE FRIARS 
WHEN THE FRIAR ASKED HOW MIRACLES COULD TAKE PLACE 
UNLESS AT GOD'S COMMAND THE MAN HAD A READY ANSWER 
HE HAD TWENTY FOUR MEN AT HIS COMMAND WHO PRODUCED MIRACLES WHENEVER HE WISHED 
HE HAD SENT THEM TO MANY PLACES IN ENGLAND TO PRODUCE MIRACLES FOR A PROFIT 
DESPITE SUCH INSTANCES OF CORRUPTION AND FRAUD 
THE CHURCH'S GRIP ON THE MEDIEVAL MIND REMAINED STRONG 
THE WORD OF THE CHURCH WAS THE WORD OF GOD 
IT COULD ABSOLVE YOU OF YOUR SINS 
IT COULD SHIELD YOU AGAINST SATAN IT COULD EVEN SEND YOU TO WAR 
IF YOU DIDN'T ACCEPT THE BELIEFS AND RITUALS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH 
YOU WERE SIMPLY AN OUTSIDER AND POSSIBLY AN ENEMY 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH BECAME INCREASINGLY BELLIGERENT TOWARDS OUTSIDERS 
PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT FAITHS ABROAD AND AT HOME 
AND ANYONE WHO DISAGREED WITH THE CHURCH 
THE HERETICS THE ENEMY WITHIN 
CHRISTIANITY HAD NOT BEGUN AS A BELLICOSE RELIGION 
TURN THE OTHER CHEEK CHRIST HAD SAID 
ELEVENTH CENTURY CHRISTIANS TOOK A DIFFERENT VIEW 
THE FOCUS OF THEIR WRATH WAS THE RISE OF ISLAM 
IN JUST A FEW CENTURIES 
ITS TEACHINGS HAD SPREAD AS FAR AFIELD AS CHINA AND SPAIN 
ITS ARMIES HAD EVEN CAPTURED THE HOLY CITY OF JERUSALEM 
IT WAS A THORN IN THE SIDE OF MEDIEVAL CHRISTIANITY 
ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF NOVEMBER ONE THOUSAND NINETY FIVE POPE URBAN THE SECOND PREACHED 
A SERMON THAT WAS TO CHANGE HISTORY 
HE URGED THE KNIGHTS WHO WERE LISTENING TO HIM TO MARCH EAST 
TO JERUSALEM TO THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE 
SUPPOSEDLY THE SITE OF JESUS'S RESURRECTION AND FREE IT FROM MUSLIM RULE 
THE RESPONSE WAS ASTONISHING 
THOUSANDS ANSWERED THE CALL TO ACTION 
THEY MARCHED TO THE HOLY LAND 
IN LESS THAN FOUR YEARS THEY RECAPTURED JERUSALEM 
THIS EXTRAORDINARY CAMPAIGN IS NOW KNOWN AS THE FIRST CRUSADE 
IT WAS FOLLOWED BY MANY OTHERS 
FIGHTING EVEN DYING IN THE CRUSADES WAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST IDEALS OF THE MIDDLE AGES 
THE TEMPLE CHURCH IN LONDON SYMBOLISES THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE CRUSADERS 
IT'S MODELLED ON THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE IN JERUSALEM 
IT WAS THE HOME OF THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR 
AN ELITE GROUP OF WARRIOR MONKS WHO FORMED ONE OF THE MOST FEARED FIGHTING UNITS OF THE CRUSADES 
THE CRUSADES WERE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER WARS BECAUSE THEY WERE HOLY WARS 
CHRISTIAN HOLY WARS 
THEY WERE AUTHORISED BY THE POPE AND THEY BROUGHT SPIRITUAL BENEFITS TO THOSE WHO FOUGHT IN THEM 
IF YOU DIED ON CRUSADE ALL YOUR SINS WERE WASHED AWAY 
THE BATTLE ON EARTH BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL 
HAD BEEN TAKEN TO A NEW LEVEL 
SAINT BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX URGED ON HIS FELLOW CHRISTIANS 
A NEW KIND OF KNIGHTHOOD HAS ARISEN 
THE KNIGHT OF CHRIST I SAY KILLS WITH AN UNTROUBLED MIND 
A CHRISTIAN MAY GLORY IN THE DEATH OF A PAGAN SINCE CHRIST IS GLORIFIED 
THE CRUSADES UNDOUBTEDLY DEEPENED HOSTILITY 
BETWEEN CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS 
BRINGING THE TWO WORLDS INTO COLLISION 
IN A WAY THAT HAS CONSEQUENCES EVEN TODAY 
THE VERY WORD CRUSADE HAS OPPOSITE MEANINGS IN THE WEST AND IN THE MUSLIM WORLD 
IN THE WEST IT MEANS A STRUGGLE FOR SOME GOOD CAUSE 
N. THE MUSLIM WORLD IT SUMMONS UP PICTURES 
OF BRUTAL AGGRESSIVE WESTERNERS 
THOSE MUSLIMS HOSTILE TO THE AMERICAN PRESENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
REVILE AMERICAN SOLDIERS THERE AS THE CRUSADERS 
THE CHRISTIAN WORLD WAS NOW ON THE OFFENSIVE 
IF MUSLIMS WERE SEEN AS THE ENEMY AT THE GATES 
THERE WAS ANOTHER ENEMY EVEN CLOSER AT HAND 
THE JEWS 
IN MOST PARTS OF MEDIEVAL EUROPE JUDAISM WAS THE ONLY NON CHRISTIAN RELIGION OFFICIALLY TOLERATED 
ITS POSITION WAS PRECARIOUS AND SOMETIMES PERILOUS 
JEWS WERE REVILED BUT THEY WERE ALSO MUCH RELIED ON AS MONEYLENDERS 
AND THEY WERE TECHNICALLY OWNED BY THE KING 
AN UNEASY ARRANGEMENT THAT ALLOWED FOR EXPLOITATION AS MUCH AS PROTECTION 
IN MEDIEVAL BRITAIN JEWS WERE TREATED WITH GROWING INTOLERANCE 
RUMOURS SPREAD OF STRANGE PRACTICES IN SYNAGOGUES 
IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR JEWS IN NORWICH WERE ACCUSED OF RITUAL MURDER 
TAKING AND KILLING A CHRISTIAN BOY IN MOCKERY OF THE CRUCIFIXION 
BUT IT WAS IN YORK THAT HOSTILITY TO JEWS SPILLED INTO VIOLENCE 
IN MARCH ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY THE PEOPLE OF YORK TURNED AGAINST THEIR LOCAL JEWS 
NEITHER THE LAW NOR REASON NOR HUMANITY STOPPED THEM 
IN THE WORDS OF A CONTEMPORARY CHRONICLER 
THE ATTACK WAS LED BY LOCAL NOBLES WHO OWED MONEY TO THE JEWS 
AND ONE THING THEY MADE SURE TO DO DURING THE DISTURBANCES 
WAS SEIZE AND BURN THE DOCUMENTS RECORDING THEIR DEBTS 
IN DESPERATION THE JEWS SOUGHT REFUGE HERE IN THE ROYAL CASTLE 
THE SITE NOW KNOWN AS CLIFFORD'S TOWER 
OUTSIDE THE CHRISTIAN MOB GATHERED 
THE INDEBTED NOBLES THE LOCAL APPRENTICES 
A HERMIT WHO SAID YOU ARE DOING GOD'S WORK 
THE JEWS RESISTED AS BEST THEY COULD 
THROWING DOWN ROCKS ON THE BESIEGERS ONE OF WHICH KILLED THE HERMIT 
BUT THEIR SITUATION WAS FAIRLY DESPERATE 
THE CHRISTIANS BROUGHT UP SIEGE MACHINES HUGE ENGINES 
THAT COULD THROW ROCKS AND BATTER DOWN THE WALLS 
THE JEWS KNEW THAT FURTHER RESISTANCE WAS IMPOSSIBLE 
THEY TURNED TO THEIR OLDEST AND WISEST MEMBER THE RABBI WHO GAVE THEM SIMPLE BUT TERRIFYING ADVICE 
MASS SUICIDE 
EACH OF THE JEWISH MEN WAS TO TAKE HIS KNIFE 
TO KILL HIS OWN WIFE TO KILL HIS OWN CHILDREN AND TO KILL HIMSELF 
THEY SET FIRE TO THE CASTLE WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS MADE OF WOOD 
AND AMONGST THE FLAMES THEY BEGAN THIS GRISLY WORK 
THOSE OF THE JEWS WHO DIDN'T TAKE THE OPTION OF SUICIDE 
BEGGED THE CHRISTIANS OUTSIDE TO LET THEM GO FREE 
THE CHRISTIANS AGREED AND THE JEWS CAME OUT THEY WERE ALL MASSACRED 
THERE WAS NOT A JEW LEFT ALIVE IN YORK THAT DAY 
HOSTILITY TOWARDS JEWS WAS FUELLED BY AN INCREASINGLY INTOLERANT CHURCH AND STATE 
THEY WERE FORCED TO WEAR DISTINGUISHING BADGES 
AND IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY EDWARD I OF ENGLAND ANNOUNCED 
THAT ALL JEWS SHOULD EITHER CONVERT OR LEAVE THE KINGDOM FOR GOOD 
THEY WOULDN'T RETURN UNTIL THE TIME OF OLIVER CROMWELL 
WITH THE JEWS BANISHED 
THE ONSLAUGHT AGAINST UNBELIEVERS CONTINUED 
AS THE CHURCH TRAINED ITS SIGHTS ON A NEW TARGET 
RELIGIOUS REFORMERS IN ITS OWN RANKS 
THESE REFORMERS WERE DANGEROUS THE ENEMY WITHIN AND NEEDED TO BE DEALT WITH 
THEIR OPPONENTS CALLED THEM LOLLARDS WHICH MEANS MUMBLERS 
MUCH OF WHAT THEY MUMBLED ABOUT ATTACKED THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH 
FROM BELIEF IN PILGRIMAGE TO THE INTERVENTION OF THE SAINTS 
THE LOLLARDS WERE INSPIRED BY THE OXFORD THEOLOGIAN JOHN WYCLIFFE 
HE WAS FOR TEN YEARS RECTOR OF THIS CHURCH 
SAINT MARY'S LUTTERWORTH IN LEICESTERSHIRE 
HE ATTACKED THE WEALTH OF THE CHURCH AND ITS INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICS 
AND HE WANTED THE BIBLE TRANSLATED FROM LATIN INTO ENGLISH 
SO THAT ORDINARY PEOPLE COULD HEAR AND UNDERSTAND THE WORDS OF SCRIPTURE IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE 
SUCH A STEP THREATENED GOD'S INTERMEDIARIES 
THE PRIESTS WHO INTERPRETED THE LATIN BIBLE FOR THE FAITHFUL 
WORSE WYCLIFFE STRUCK AT A CORE BELIEF 
THAT DURING HOLY COMMUNION 
BREAD AND WINE WERE TURNED INTO THE BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST 
HIS SCORN FOR THIS DOCTRINE UNDERMINED THE MYSTERY THE MAGIC OF CHRISTIAN RITUAL 
AS SUPPORT FOR WYCLIFFE GREW AT LAMBETH PALACE 
SEAT OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
CHURCH AUTHORITIES DECIDED TO ACT 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT WYCLIFFE WAS BROUGHT TO THE CHAPEL OF LAMBETH PALACE TO BE TRIED FOR HIS BELIEFS 
IT WAS A RAUCOUS OCCASION A CROWD OF LONDONERS BURST IN TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT 
WYCLIFFE DEFENDED HIS VIEWS COOLLY AND WITH CONVICTION 
BUT IN THE END THE BISHOPS CONDEMNED HIM TO PERPETUAL SILENCE 
WYCLIFFE RETURNED TO LUTTERWORTH 
FORBIDDEN EVER TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE CHURCH 
HE DIED THERE IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR 
THE POPE DID NOT FORGET JOHN WYCLIFFE 
MANY YEARS LATER HE ORDERED HIS BONES TO BE BURNED AND THE ASHES THROWN INTO THE LOCAL RIVER 
MEANWHILE WYCLIFFE'S FOLLOWERS COULD NOT BE SILENCED 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THEY NAILED A STINGING ATTACK ON THE CHURCH TO THE DOOR OF WESTMINSTER HALL 
WE POOR MEN DEMAND THE REFORMATION OF THE HOLY CHURCH OF ENGLAND 
WHICH HAS BEEN BLIND AND LEPROUS MANY YEARS 
AND A GREAT BURDEN TO PEOPLE HERE IN ENGLAND 
REFORMATION WAS NOT A WORD THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH WANTED TO HEAR 
MANY OF WYCLIFFE'S FOLLOWERS WERE ROUNDED UP AND INTERROGATED 
SOME IT IS SAID WERE LOCKED UP IN LAMBETH PALACE ITSELF 
THE TRADITIONAL NAME OF THIS PLACE IS LOLLARD'S TOWER 
IT'S A RATHER GRIM AND FRIGHTENING PLACE 
YOU CAN STILL SEE THE RINGS ON THE WALLS 
WHERE THE PRISONERS WERE MANACLED 
IT'S A RATHER FRIGHTENING REMINDER 
OF THE DANGERS OF BEING A HERETIC IN MEDIEVAL ENGLAND 
IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED ONE A LOLLARD PREACHER WAS BURNED AT THE STAKE 
HE WAS THE FIRST OF MANY TO BE BURNED FOR THEIR BELIEFS IN MEDIEVAL ENGLAND 
ACROSS EUROPE THE CHURCH AIMED TO ROOT OUT ALL OPPOSITION 
MEN AND WOMEN WERE DRAGGED BEFORE RELIGIOUS COURTS 
ALL HERESY WAS TO BE CRUSHED 
THOUSANDS WERE KILLED IN THE NAME OF GOD 
FOR GROWING NUMBERS OF PEOPLE 
THE CHURCH'S BRUTAL INTRANSIGENCE BECAME INTOLERABLE 
ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE LOLLARDS ATTACKED THE IDEA OF PRAYER FOR THE DEAD 
PILGRIMAGE THE WEALTH AND POWER OF THE BISHOPS AND WHAT THEY CALLED THE FEIGNED MIRACLE OF THE MASS 
ANOTHER ASSAULT WAS LAUNCHED AIMED AT THE HEART OF THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH 
AND THIS TIME WHAT FOLLOWED WAS A FULL SCALE WAR OF IDEAS 
THAT MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION 
THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH WAS ABOUT TO FACE ITS OWN DAY OF JUDGMENT 
THE RELIGIOUS LANDSCAPE OF BRITAIN WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN 
THE FEAR OF ARMAGEDDON 
THE FASCINATION WITH THE SUPERNATURAL 
THE CULT OF THE SAINTS 
THE GREAT JOURNEYS OF PILGRIMAGE 
DESTINED TO BECOME RELICS OF THE MEDIEVAL AGE
