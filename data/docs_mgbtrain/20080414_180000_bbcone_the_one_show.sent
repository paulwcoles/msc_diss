CHRISTINE BLEAKLEY AND ADRIAN 
CHILES CHILES DAVE GORMAN JOINS US THIS EVENING 
HE HAS SHOPPED HIMSELF ACROSS 
AMERICA WITHOUT USING CHAINS LIKE 
STARBUCKS AND MCDONALD'S IS IT 
POSSIBLE DAVE 
IT IS POSSIBLE BUT 
IT'S WORSE HERE REALLY HAVING REALLY HAVING COME BACK AND YOU SEE EVERY HIGH 
STREET DOES LOOK THE SAME AT THE 
MOMENT WE DON'T HAVE THE PETROL 
STATIONS THEY DO THEY HAVE THESE 
REMOTE TOWNS WITH ONE DUSTY GAS 
PUMP BIT SIDE OF THE ROAD WE DON'T 
HAVE ANY OF THOSE EQUIVALENTS YOU YOU WERE REMINISCING ABOUT INDEPENDENT 
GAS STATION 
I USE THE TO LOVE THAT 
BACK HOME YOU WOULD SAY HELL GROW 
A PERSON 
THEY WOULD WASH YOUR 
WINDSCREENS AND CHECK YOUR TYRES 
EXACTLY WE WILL REMINISCE LATER 
FOUR WEEKS AGO WE WERE ASKING WHY 
THE MISSING SHANNON MATTHEWS' STORY 
GOT A FRACTION OF THE MEDIA 
COVERAGE DEVOTED TO THE MISSING 
MADELEINE MCCANN 
IT HAD PLENTY OF 
COVERAGE SINCE SHANNON WAS FOUND IN 
A RELATIVE'S FLAT 
IS THIS JUST PLAIN SNOBBERY OR DO 
THEY SPEAK SOME TRUTH A PAPER WITH 
ITS EAR A BIT NEARER THE GROUND ON 
THIS ONE IS THE YORKSHIRE EVENING 
POST WE ASKED ITS MAN ON THE 
SHANNON STORY FOR HIS IMPRESSION OF 
THE ESTATE IS IT REALLY ANYTHING 
LIKE THIS 
COME AND WATCH PIKIES MAKING A MESS 
AS THE LIVES FLE GIVEN BY HIM 
UPSTAIRS AND KIDS THEY'RE 
CONVIPBSD ARE NOT ACTUALLY THEIRS 
WICKED 
WE ARE WORTH EVERY PENNY WICKED FOR GRINDING YOUR AXIS 
YOU PAY THE TAXES 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF SOME OF THE 
REPORTING THAT HAD COMPARED THE 
DEWSBURY MOOR ESTATE TO THE CHANNEL 
FOUR SERIES SHAMELESS 
A LOT OF 
RUBBISH IT'S JUST A T. V. SHOW THIS 
IS REALITY THEY SAID THEY WALKED 
AROUND THE ESTATE IN OUR PYJAMAS 
ALL DAY THE PICTURE THAT WAS IN 
THE SUN IT WAS ME IN MY PYJAMAS 
WITH KAREN BUT I DON'T WALK THE 
STREETS IN MY PYJAMAS L. BET THAT 
IS THE ONLY ONE PICTURE THEY'VE GOT 
WALK AROUND TAKE A PICTURE PUT A 
CAPTION WITH IT PEOPLE BELIEVE IT 
YEAH 
THAT'S THE TROUBLE THAT IS YEAH WHAT A LOT OF PAPERS ARE DOING WE 
ARE NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM ON 
SHAMELESS WALKING AROUND WITH CANS 
OF BEERS IN OUR HANDS HALVE 
DRESSED AND STINKING OF PEE I'VE I'VE BEEN A JOURNALIST FOR TEN YEARS L. 
KNOW THE TRICKS YOU CAN PICK A FEW 
SKANKY CORNERS AND PORTRAY 
WHICHEVER STORY YOU WANT LOOK AT 
THE BIGGER PICTURE THE STANDARD OF 
THE HOUSING IS QUALITY THE ROOFS 
ARE ALL GOOD THERE ARE KIDS PLAY 
AREAS PEOPLE ARE OUT ON THE STREET 
TALKING TO EACH OTHER 
THERE IS A 
LOT OF DECENT HARD WORKING PEOPLE 
AROUND HERE THEY'VE DONE A LOT TO 
HELP FIND SHANNON IT GIVES A BAD 
REPUTATION TO PEOPLE WHO ARE DECENT 
IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE EVERY TIME 
DEWSBURY IS MENTIONED SOMETHING 
BAD ON THE NEWS IT ISN'T BAD 
PLACE TO BE IT ISN'T AT ALL L. L. 
LIVE AROUND HERE AND I KNOW SO IT 
ISN'T A BAD PLACE AT ALL ONE ONE REPORT SAID THAT DEWSBURY MOOR IS 
HOME TO SOME OF THE WORST ELEMENTS 
OF THE WHITE UNDER CLASS HOW DOES 
THAT MAKE YOU FEEL 
THEY CAN SAY 
WHAT THEY WANT ABOUT THE ESTATE 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I'LL SAY 
IT AGAIN IT HASN'T STOPPED THEM 
KNOCKING ON US DOORS TO HAVE A CUP 
OF TEA OR USING OUR TOILETS LET 
THEM PRINT RUBBISH IT'S TOMORROW'S 
TOILET ROLL ISN'T IT THE THE QUALITIES I'VE SEEN IN THE PEOPLE 
HERE THAT HAVE BEEN WARM THEY'VE 
BEEN FRIENDLY THEY'VE BEEN OPEN 
AND THEY'VE BEEN GENEROUS L. THINK 
A LOT OF COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN 
THE COUNTRY WOULD PAY DAILY TO HAVE 
SOME OF THE QUALITYS THAT DEWSBURY 
MOOR HAS GOT 
JUSTIN YOU SPENT TIME THERE WHAT 
DID YOU MAKE OF THE PLACE 
IT HAS 
ITS ROUGH ELEMENT WHEN WE WERE UP 
THERE THERE WERE A GROUP OF KIDS 
CAUSING A NUISANCE BUT BASICALLY 
I AGREE WITH VERY MUCH WHAT WAS 
SAID IN THAT IT'S AN ESTATE WITH A 
REAL SENSE OF PRIDE EVERYBODY GOT 
TOGETHER WITH THE SHANNON THING 
AND DID THEIR BEST TO CAMPAIGN 
THERE WAS A GREAT SENSE OF A 
COMMUNITY KET GETTING TOGETHER AND 
WORKING REALLY HARD TO TRY AND FIND 
SHANNON IT WAS WONDERFUL WHEN WE 
WERE UP THERE VERY FUNNY PEOPLE 
WE HAD A GOOD TIME ON THE ESTATE 
DAVE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT 
THERE'S GOODNESS EVERYWHERE NO 
MATTER WHERE YOU GO YOU CAN GET 
TARRED WITH THE SAME BRUSH 
ABSOLUTELY IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
WHEN SOMEONE COMMITS CORPORATE 
FRAUD AND STEELS ONE MILLION NO ONE 
SAYS LOOK AT THE STREET THEY LIVE 
ON WHAT A TERRIBLE THING NO ONE 
LOOKS AT THE WIDER PICTURE WITH 
THAT CRIME WHY WITH THIS 
ON THE 
OTHER HAND WE ARE BEING 
POLITICALLY CORRECT THERE IS 
GOODNESS IN EVERYTHING BUT WE HAVE 
ALL DRIVEN THROUGH PLACES AND 
LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND 
THOUGHT WHAT A DUMP FULL OF 
HORRIBLE VILE PEOPLE WE'VE ALL 
DONE THAT NOT NECESSARILY THERE 
BUT OTHER PLACES 
I WOULD BE 
WORRIED ABOUT WALKING THROUGH 
DEWSBURY MOOR AT NIGHT BECAUSE I 
DON'T KNOW THE AREA BUT THE PEOPLE 
WHO LIVE THERE YOU KNOW THEY FEEL 
SAFE THERE IT'S INTO THE DANGEROUS 
COMMUNITY IF 
YOU LIVE THERE ALSO ALSO YOU GET PLACES WHERE THERE'S MORE 
DEPRIVATION AND MORE POVERTY AND 
MORE BAD THINGS GOING ON YEAH 
THAT FEELS MORE THREATENING NOT 
EVERYONE WHO LIVES THERE IS PART OF 
THAT IT'S THAT SWEEPING STATEMENT 
THAT DEMONISES PEOPLE ANGELLICA ANGELLICA YOU COME FROM A ROUGH ESTATE I I ALWAYS LOVED TO SEE MY UNCLE AND 
COUSINS ON THEIR ROUGH ESTATE 
THERE WAS A SENSE OF COMMUNITY 
THEY'VE GROWN UP TO BE WELL ROUNDED 
INDIVIDUALS THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
A BIT OF POVERTY AND THEY MIGHT NOT 
HAVE HAD A LOT OF STUFF BUT THAT 
DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE NOT A GOOD 
PERSON 
DID THEY LIKE COMING TO SEE PERSON YOU IN YOUR IVORY TOWER 
YEAH IN 
MY PALACE YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY 
THEY KNEW PEOPLE AROUND L. DIDN'T 
KNOW WHO LIVED ON EITHER SIDE OF ME 
ISN'T IT NICE 
A FIFTY ACRE ESTATE 
IT'S DIFFICULT 
I DID NOT 
DAISKS YOUR TRAVELS TAKE YOU TO 
EXOTIC PLACES IT WOULD BE 
FASCINATING TO GO TO PLACES LIKE 
THIS THE MORE TROUBLED PLACES IN 
THIS COUNTRY IS IT LESS FUN 
BROADCASTING ABOUT THOSE PLACES 
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TO ROUGH PLACES 
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD L. L. WAS 
NEAR MISSISSIPPI AND A GUY PULLED A 
GUN AT ME AFTER HE NEARLY CRASHED 
IN MY CAR I'VE BEEN IN SOME ROUGH 
SCRAPES 
YOU HAVE LIVED A BIT SCRAPES LAST MONTH ON THE ONE SHOW WE 
FEATURED SOME UNPLEASANT SCENES BUT 
THEY WERE WELL CARED FOR ELDERLY 
SEALS WITH CATARACT PROBLEMS AT A 
RESCUE CENTRE IN CORNWALL TODAY 
ELLIE HARRISON'S LOOKING AT THE 
PLIGHT OF ORPHAN SEAL PUPS WHO HAVE 
EVERY CHANCE OF GETTING BACK TO THE 
SEA SEA SEERBLGS THE U. K.'S LARGEST MAMMALS 
TOTALLY AT HOME IN THEIR WATERY 
WORLD WORLD IN FACT THEY'RE SO WELL SUITED TO 
THIS ENVIRONMENT YOU WOULD NEVER 
THINK THEY COULD GET INTO TROUBLE 
BUT THAT'S WHERE YOU WOULD BE WRONG 
I'VE COME TO THE NORTH NORFOLK 
COAST WHERE THE STRONG CURRENTS AND 
THE CHOPPY SEAS CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR 
SCORES OF SEAL PUPS EVERY YEAR 
SOME THEM GET STRANDED ON BEACHES 
LIKE THIS AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS 
THEY NEED OUR HELP 
THE TROUBLE STRUCK SEALS END UP IN 
THE CARE OF THE LOCAL R. S. P. C. A. ALISON 
CHARLES HEADS UP THE RESCUE TEAM 
MORNING ALISON HOW ARE YOU I'M I'M FINE THANK YOU HOW ARE YOU FINE FINE THANKS A BIT CHILLY HOW HAVE THE 
SEALS ENDED UP HERE IN YOUR 
SANCTUARY 
A LOT OF THEM ARE ORPHAN SANCTUARY PUPS THEY'VE BEEN SPLIT UP FROM 
THEIR MUM AND NEEDED HELP 
WHY DO 
THEY GET SEPARATED FROM THEIR 
MOTHERS 
WE GET TWO SPECIES IN HERE MOTHERS THE COMMONS AND THE GREYS THE 
COMMONS HAVE THEIR PUPS IN THE 
SUMMER THEY CAN GET SPLIT UP BY 
THE TIDE AND THE CURRENTS AND 
THEY'RE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO STAY 
WITH THEIR MUM WITH THE GREYS WE 
HAD A HUGE STORM IN THE NORTH EAST 
IN SCOTLAND DURING THE WINTER 
WE'VE HAD A LOT IN SINCE THEN WE 
ARE ABSOLUTELY PACKED 
YOU HAVE 
COMMONS AND GREYS IN THE SAME POOL 
WHAT IS THE EASYIEST WAY TO TELL 
THEM APART 
THE COMMONS ARE THE 
LITTLE ONES THEY'VE GOT FINER 
FEATURES A LABRADOR TYPE HEAD WE 
HAVE A LARGER GREYS THAT LOOK VERY 
MUCH LIKE HORSES THEY HAVE THE 
LONG STRONG ROMAN NOSE A MUCH 
BIGGER BEAST AS WELL 
HOW MANY ARE 
YOU HOPING TO RELEASE TODAY WE WE HOPE TO HAVE FIVE WE NEED TO WEIGH 
THEM WE WILL DRAIN THE POOL AND 
POP INTO THE BOTTOM POOL AND 
HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HELP ME WEIGH 
THEM O. K. THEM O. K. IT WILL TAKE AN HOUR FOR THE POOL 
TO DRAIN BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF 
OTHER CRUCIAL JOBS FOR US TO DO 
TOP OF THE LIST IS LUNCH AND ALISON 
USES ALL SORTS OF TRICKS TO MAKE 
FEEDING TIME MORE INTERESTING 
WHY IS THERE FISH IN A CRATE IT 
LOOKS BIZARRE 
IT'S A FANTASTIC WAY 
OF KEEPING THEM KEEN IT HELPS THEM 
TO FORAGE WHILE THEY'RE IN HERE 
YOU KNOW WE WANT THEM READY TO GO 
INTO THE HARSH ENVIRONMENT I'M I'M INTERESTED IN SEEING HOW THIS WORKS 
LET'S GO WATCH YOU GOT A FREE BEE 
HE DID 
BECAUSE OF MY INEFFICIENCY 
HE'S KEEN 
IT'S QUITE A CHALLENGE GETTING FISH 
OUT OF THAT YEAH YEAH THAT MUST BE SEAL FOR THANK YOU 
THE AIM IS TO KEEP THE SEALS AS 
WILD AS POSSIBLE WE WILL GO BACK 
TO THE POOL THAT'S BEEN DRAINED TO 
SEE IF TODAY'S SEALS ARE READY FOR 
RELEASE RELEASE AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR ALISON 
AND HER TEAM RELEASE THE SEALS 
EVERY COUPLE WEEKS AS MORE AND MORE 
REACH THEIR TARGET WEIGHT 
BARCELONA YOU ARE HEAVY HEAVY 
NICE AND FEISTY 
THE STAFF ARE VERY VERY FIT HERE 
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE I'M WARMING UP 
A TREAT HERE 
THAT'S ALL OF THE SEALS IN THE VAN 
ALL WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS GET THEM 
TO RELEASE SITE 
WE'RE NOT RELEASING THEM INTO THE 
SEA BUT INTO THE RIVER NEEM WHICH 
FLOWS OUT INTO THE WASH BRITAIN'S 
BIGGEST ESTUARY 
ALISON MAKES SURE THEY RELEASED THE 
SEALS AT HIGH TIDE SO THEY GET 
SWEPT DOWN THE RIVER AND INTO THE 
WASHINGTON 
NO EMOTION JUST DOING YOUR JOB 
JOB COMPLETE REALLY GOOD WORK ALL 
OF THE TEAM HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB 
FANTASTIC THEY'RE BACK OUT THERE 
IT'S GREAT TO SEE 
THE SEALS WILL SPEND THE NEXT YEAR 
LEARNING ABOUT THEIR NEW HOME 
FINDING OUT WHERE'S GOOD FOR 
FUSHING BEFORE THEY SETTLE DOWN 
INTO A MORE SEDENTARY ADULT 
LIFESTYLE FOR NOW THANKS TO THE 
HELP OF ALISON AND HER TEAM 
THEY'VE GOT ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES 
BEFORE THEM 
A LOVELY HAPPY ENDING THAT IS WHAT 
WE LIKE LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THAT 
HAPPY LITTLE SEAL 
ARE YOU SURE THAT IS HAPPY YOU YOU HAVE EATEN SEALS JUSTIN 
YES L. 
HAD A SEAL FLIPPER PIE 
THEY'RE AN 
ENDANGERED SPECIES 
THEY'RE NOT ALL 
ENDANGERED THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF 
THEM KILLED IN CANADA EVERY YEAR L. 
HAD ONE FLIPPER IT'S LIKE DEER OR 
SOMETHING 
I'M SHOCKED 
YOU EAT SOMETHING DEER AS WELL 
COME ON THERE'S 
NOTHING WRONG WITH EATING DEER I I HAVE A GOOD MIND TO SEND YOU OFF 
THE SOFA THAT'S TERRIBLE DAVE 
YOU WOULDN'T EAT A SEAL WOULD YOU 
IF I DID I WOULD TAKE JUST THE 
FLIPPER FOR SEAL THAT HADN'T BEEN 
KILLED AND WAS HAPPY TO GO AROUND 
IN CIRCLES 
AND THEN MAKE A 
DOCUMENTARY ABOUT IT 
THAT WOULD BE 
O. K. O. K. DAISKS YOU ARE FAMOUS FOR MANY 
THINGS INCLUDING ARE YOU DAVE

CHAINS YOU RECKON EVERY HIGH STREET 
WHAT IS YOUR MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT 
WE STAYED IN A FANTASTIC B. AND AMP B. IN 
IDAHO IN THE SHAPE OF AN EAGLE 
IT'S NOT PART OF CHAIN 
A UNIQUE 
PLACE IT WAS SUPERB A BEAUTIFUL 
PART OF THE WORLD 
LET'S SOUTH EAST 
I'M NOT SURE IF 
BUILDING A B. AND AMP B. IN THE SHAPE OF A 
BEAGLE IS NECESSARILY NOBLE IT'S 
DEFINITELY ABSURD I'VE ONLY JUST 
NOTICED A SCALE MODEL THIS IS THE 
BELLY OF THE DOG L. WAS THERE A 
LITTLE BATHROOM THERE UP THESE 
STAIRS IN THE NOSE A HARD SURFACE 
DO INDEPENDENTS NOT EXIST ANY MORE 
BECAUSE THEY WERE NO GOOD IN THE 
FIRST PLACE OR BECAUSE THEY 
COULDN'T COMPETE 
IT'S A MIXTURE OF 
THINGS IT'S PARTLY NOT BEING ABLE 
TO COMPETE ON BULK BUYING AND THAT 
KIND OF THING IT'S JUST THE 
WORLD'S CHANGED IT USED TO BE IF 
YOUR DAD WAS A GREEN GOVERNORS YOU 
BECAME A GREENGROCER THAT IS NO 
LONGER THE CASE WE MET A DIERN 
CALLED TAYLOR'S IN OREGON IT WAS 
CLOSING BECAUSE THEY WERE RETIRING 
AND THEIR KIDS WERE DOING OTHER 
THINGS NOW

MEN OF A CERTAIN AGE DO DON'T

DISEASE ME THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH 
TOO MUCH TIME ON THEIR HANDS I I THINK THERE ARE AND THAT'S A 
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER THEY WERE DOING 
THAT THAN MAKING THE DEVIL'S WORK 
I MEAN

ALTERNATIVES FOR PEOPLE SITTING AT

LOST WITHOUT A JOB TO GO TO 
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT CAN WE COME ON 
IF YOU NEED A BIT OF INSPIRATION AS 
TO HOW TO MAKE YOUR RETIREMENT 
YEARS THE BEST OF YOUR LIFE HERE 
IT IS 
ANGELLICA BELL SPENT SOME 
TIME WITH PENSIONERS INTENT ON 
HAVING A BALL TODAY WE FIND HER 
WITH A SEVENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD WHO IS SHOWING 
NO SIGNS OF SLOWING UP 
SILVERSTONE THE HOME OF MOTOR 
RACING RACING THIS TRACK HAS SEEN MANY GREATS 
COME AND GO BUT THERE'S ONE MAN 
WHO SIMPLY REFUSES TO DO HIS FINAL 
LAP OF HONOUR HE MIGHT BE IN HIS 
SEVENTIES BUT THAT'S NOT SLOWING HIM 
DOWN AND HE'S TAKING ME FOR AN 
EIGHTY M. P. H. SPIN WOO HOO WOO HOO WOW THAT WAS EXCITING 
WELL IT'S 
ALWAYS BEEN EXCITING FOR ME TOO 
YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR 
FIFTY EIGHT YEARS SO IT ISN'T SORT OF 
SOMETHING THAT'S NEW TO ME BUT I 
LOVE IT 
WHAT MADE YOU GET INTO 
RACING 
MY BOSS ACTUALLY TAT FILM RACING STUDIOS I USED TO WORK AT THE 
DEVON FILM STUDIOS HE WAS RACING 
HE STARTED ME OFF AS A MATTER OF 
FACT HE HELPED ME TO BUILD MY 
FIRST CAR ONE LIKE THIS ACTUALLY 
SPORTS CARS HAVE CHANGED BEYOND 
RECOGNITION SINCE DOUG FIRST PULLED 
ON HIS DRIVING GLOVES BUT HE'S 
TRADITIONALIST AT HEART HAND HE'S 
STILL RACING CAR FROM THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
WHO IS OLDER THE CAR OR YOU 
I AM 
THAT'S TWO MONTHS YOUNGER THAN ME 
I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE AUGUST AND 
THIS WAS MADE IN OCTOBER OF THAT 
SAME YEAR SO IT'S A YOUNGSTER 
COMPARED WITH ME THIS IS AN AUSTIN 
SEVEN ORIGINALLY THE CHASSIS AND 
ENGINE AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS NINETEEN TWENTY NINE 
IT WAS JUST AN ORDINARY FAMILY CAR 
IN ITS DAY IT WAS THE EQUIVALENT 
OF THE MINI IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX TO TWENTY EIGHT BUT I HAVE 
WORKED ON IT QUITE A BIT TO TUNE IT 
UP FOR RACING PURPOSES 
THERE IS 
NOTHING A RACING DRIVER LOVES MORE 
THAN A GOOD OLD FASHIONED ONE ON 
ONE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE 
GOT LINED UP FOR DOUG IN POLE 
POSITION DASHING DOUG AT SEVENTY EIGHT YEARS 
OLD THE FASTEST GRANDAD IN GREAT 
BRITAIN AND NUMBER TWO ON THE GRID 
RACING REG NICE A MERE 
WHIPPERSNAPPER AT SIXTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE 
I WONDER IF HIS MOTHER KNOWS WHAT 
HE'S UP TO ON YOUR MARKS GET SET 
GO 
LOVE LOVE DOUG'S INTO A FLYING START BREAKING 
INTO THE FIRST CORNER AND MANAGING 
TO KEEP THE YOUNG CONTENDER REG 
AT BAY WHILE THEY BATTLE IT OUT ON 
THE TRACK MIKE STRIPE OF THE 
VINTAGE CAR CLUB IS TELLING ME 
ABOUT VINTAGE DRIVERS 
I THINK YOU 
PROBABLY CONTINUE TO GET BETTER 
LIKE ALL THINGS YOU DO IF YOU KEEP 
AT IT FOR A LONG LONG TIME YOU GET 
BETTER AND BETTER PHYSICALLY THERE 
MAY BE LIMITATIONS THE THOUGHT 
PROCESS MAY SLOW DOWN I DON'T 
KNOW I AM NOT A DOCTOR BUT 
CERTAINLY AS DOUG HAS DEVELOPED 
WITH THE CAR OVER FIFTY YEARS HE'LL 
KNOW THAT CAR BETTER THAN ANYBODY 
AND THEY'LL BOTH BE PERFORMING THAN 
THEY WERE THIRTY YEARS AGO 
SO WHAT'S 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RACING THEN 
AND RACING NOW 
IT WAS NO WHERE NEAR AS SAFE TO GO 
RACING IN THE THIRTIES FORTIES FIFTIES 
THEY DON'T HAVE ROLL HOOPS OR FULL 
HARNESSES A CONTACT ACCIDENT 
BETWEEN ANY OF THESE RACES IS 
SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE 
THEY GIVE EACH OTHER SPACE THEY 
RESPECT EACH OTHER'S ABILITIES 
WHEN THEY STARTED THIS BUSINESS 
BACK IN THE THIRTIES IT WAS VERY BRAVE 
MEN INDEED 
WHAT I AM UNDERSTANDING 
IS WHETHER YOU WERE A RACING CAR 
DRIVER IN THE THIRTIES OR NOW IT'S THE 
SAME AS BEING A SIX YEAR OLD BOY 
WITH YOUR LITTLE TOYS AND HAVING 
THAT REAL PASSION 
IT'S THE SAME 
PASSION THAT YOU DEVELOP AS A CHILD 
WHICH SAYS I WANT GO MOTOR RACING 
ONE DAY AND YOU CARRY THAT 
THROUGHOUT LIFE EVEN INTO BEING A 
PENSIONER AND YEAH IT'S A GREAT 
THING TO SEE 
AND ON THE FINAL 
STRAIGHT DOUG IS JUST MANAGING TO 
KEEP REG OUT BUT IT'S PRETTY MUCH 
NECK AND NECK YEAH AND DOUG WINS 
BY A WHISKER SO THE NEXT TIME 
YOU'RE AT THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND 
BOY RACER COMES UP ALONGSIDE YOU 
LOOK AGAIN IT MIGHT JUST BE DOUG 
ANGELICA'S SEARCH FOR A SUGAR DADDY
