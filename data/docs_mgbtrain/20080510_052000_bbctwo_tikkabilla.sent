SO THE CLOCK SAYS IT'S TEN O'CLOCK 
BUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CLOCK

AND HERE'S SARAH JANE WITH THE STORY 
THIS STORY IS CALLED MR. WOLF'S PANCAKES 
ONE DAY MR. WOLF WAS FEELING HUNGRY 
HE FANCIED SOME PANCAKES 
YUM YUM HE SAID 
LICKING HIS LIPS AT THE THOUGHT 
OF A BIG PILE OF FRESH DELICIOUS PANCAKES 
MR. WOLF HAD NEVER MADE PANCAKES BEFORE 
SO HE TOOK HIS BIG RECIPE BOOK OFF THE SHELF AND HE LOOKED INSIDE 
BUT WOLVES CAN'T READ VERY WELL 
AND MR. WOLF HAD TROUBLE MAKING SENSE OF IT 
SO HE WENT TO GET SOME HELP FROM HIS NEIGHBOURS 
HE CALLED ON CHICKEN LICKIN' WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR 
PLEASE COULD YOU HELP ME READ THIS HE ASKED 
NO SAID CHICKEN LICKIN' 
SLAMMING THE DOOR IN MR. WOLF'S FACE BANG 
OH DEAR SIGHED MR. WOLF 
HE SAT DOWN SLOWLY READ THE BOOK 
AND WORKED OUT WHAT HE NEEDED ALL BY HIMSELF 
MR. WOLF LOOKED IN HIS CUPBOARD FOR THE INGREDIENTS 
BUT HE COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING HE NEEDED 
I'LL GO TO THE SHOP HE DECIDED 
AND HE SETTLED DOWN TO WRITE A LIST 
BUT WOLVES AREN'T VERY GOOD AT WRITING 
SO MR. WOLF CALLED ON WEE WILLIE WINKIE 
YOU'RE VERY CLEVER SAID MR. WOLF 
CAN YOU HELP ME WRITE MY SHOPPING LIST PLEASE 
NO SAID WEE WILLIE WINKIE GO AWAY 
HE SLAMMED HIS DOOR BANG 
OH THERE'S NO NEED TO BE LIKE THAT SAID MR. WOLF QUIETLY 
MR. WOLF SAT DOWN AND TRIED VERY HARD WITH HIS WRITING 
UNTIL HE HAD MADE HIS SHOPPING LIST 
ALL BY HIMSELF 
NOW HE NEEDED TO COUNT HIS MONEY TO MAKE SURE HE HAD ENOUGH 
BUT WOLVES AREN'T VERY GOOD AT COUNTING 
HE WENT TO THE GINGERBREAD MAN FOR SOME HELP 
CAN YOU HELP ME COUNT MY MONEY PLEASE HE ASKED POLITELY 
NO I'M TOO BUSY TO BOTHER WITH YOU SAID THE GINGERBREAD MAN 
SLAMMING HIS DOOR BANG 
SO POOR MR. WOLF HAD TO SIT DOWN AND COUNT HIS MONEY 
IT TOOK HIM A LONG TIME 
HE HAD TO CHECK IT THREE TIMES BEFORE IT WAS RIGHT 
BUT HE DID IT ALL BY HIMSELF 
MR. WOLF NEEDED A BASKET TO CARRY HIS SHOPPING 
SO HE CALLED ON LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD 
PLEASE MAY I BORROW YOUR BASKET HE ASKED VERY NICELY 
I'M NOT LENDING MY BASKET TO YOU SAID LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD 
NOW CLEAR OFF 
SO MR. WOLF SET OFF TO THE SHOP WITHOUT A BASKET 
I'LL MANAGE HE SAID 
MR. WOLF WENT TO THE SHOP 
HE LOOKED AT THE LIST REMEMBERED WHAT HE NEEDED 
COUNTED OUT HIS MONEY 
AND CARRIED THE EGGS MILK AND FLOUR HOME 
ALL BY HIMSELF 
NOW IT WAS TIME TO MAKE THE PANCAKES 
BUT WOLVES AREN'T VERY GOOD AT COOKING 
SO MR. WOLF CALLED ON THE THREE LITTLE PIGS 
PLEASE CAN YOU HELP ME COOK MY PANCAKES 
I'LL SHARE THEM WITH YOU HE SAID KINDLY 
NO CHANCE CHORUSED THE PIGS 
SLAMMING THEIR DOORS BANG BANG BANG 
OH MR. WOLF FELT SAD 
BECAUSE NOBODY WANTED TO HELP HIM 
MR. WOLF WENT HOME AND STARTED TO MAKE THE PANCAKES ALL BY HIMSELF 
SOON THERE WAS A HUGE PILE OF DELICIOUS PANCAKES ON THE TABLE 
ALL READY FOR EATING 
M. M. M. 
NOW AS MR. WOLF HAD BEEN MAKING HIS PANCAKES 
A LOVELY SMELL HAD DRIFTED OUT OF THE KITCHEN 
ALL HIS NEIGHBOURS COULD SMELL IT 
AND IT MADE THEM FEEL VERY HUNGRY 
THEY WANTED SOME PANCAKES TOO 
THEY DECIDED TO TRY THEIR LUCK 
SO THEY KNOCKED ON MR. WOLF'S DOOR 
GIVE US SOME OF YOUR PANCAKES SAID THE ROTTEN LOT 
WHY SHOULD I GIVE ANY TO YOU SAID MR. WOLF 
NOT ONE OF YOU WOULD HELP ME 
WE'LL HELP YOU EAT THEM REPLIED MR. WOLF'S NEIGHBOURS NASTILY 
WE'RE NOT GOING AWAY UNTIL YOU GIVE US SOME 
MR. WOLF THOUGHT VERY HARD FOR A MOMENT 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE DECENT THING TO DO 
OH VERY WELL THEN HE SIGHED YOU HAD BETTER COME IN 
MR. WOLF OPENED THE DOOR WIDE 
AND WHOOSH HIS GREEDY NEIGHBOURS RUDELY PUSHED HIM ASIDE 
AND DASHED DOWN THE HALL 
MR. WOLF SHOOK HIS HEAD SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS 
AND FOLLOWED THEM INTO THE KITCHEN 
AND WHEN THEY WERE ALL IN 
MR. WOLF GOBBLED THEM UP 
SNIPPETY SNAPPETY 
AND THAT WAS THE END OF HIS UNHELPFUL NEIGHBOURS 
AND THEN WITH HIS BULGING TUMMY NOT QUITE FULL
