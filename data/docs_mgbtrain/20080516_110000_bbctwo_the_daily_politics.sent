HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE DAILY 
POLITICS ON FRIDAY 
TWO WEEKS ON FROM CYCLONE NARGIS 
AND THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES ARE 
STILL RESTRICTING INTERNATIONAL AID 
TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN NEED 
WE'LL SPEAK TO THE MINISTER FOR 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
FOURTEEN M. P.'S WILL HAVE TO FACE THE MUSIC 
AS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS LOSES HIS HIGH COURT BATTLE 
TO KEEP THEIR EXPENSES SECRET 
WE'VE GOT THE DETAILS 
HOW TO BEAT THE ENERGY PRICE HIKES 
WE LOOK AT DAVID CAMERON'S PLANS TO 
ENCOURAGE HOUSEHOLDERS TO GENERATE 
THEIR OWN ELECTRICITY IT IS THE 
ISSUE THAT SPARKED MR. BROWN'S 
BIGGEST BACKBENCH REVOLT SO FAR 
AND IT WAS A STORY OF NUMBERS FOR 
GORDON THIS WEEK A TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION 
TAX CUT EIGHTEEN BILLS AND THREE MEMOIRS 
BUT WHICH STORY TOPPED YOUR 
POLITICAL POPS FIND OUT LATER IN 
THE SHOW 
AND WITH ME TODAY ARE THE ASSOCIATE 
EDITOR OF THE DAILY MIRROR KEVIN 
MAGUIRE AND THE DAILY MAIL'S A. N. N. 
LESLIE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME 
FIRST TO A STORY BREAKING THIS 
MORNING THE HIGH COURT HAS DECIDED 
THAT M. P.'S HAVE TO WASH THEIR DIRTY 
LINEN IN PUBLIC AND DISCLOSE THEIR 
SECOND HOME EXPENSES IN JANUARY 
FOURTEEN M. P.'S INCLUDING GORDON BROWN 
WERE TOLD BY THE INFORMATION 
TRIBUNAL TO DISCLOSE DETAILS AND 
ADDRESSES OF THOSE HOMES FOLLOWING 
A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST 
BUT A GROUP LED BY COMMONS SPEAKER 
MICHAEL MARTIN CHALLENGED THE 
RULING ARGUING THAT PUBLISHING 
M. P.S' ADDRESSES COULD BE AL SECURITY 
RISK THAT CHALLENGE WAS OVERRULED 
TODAY SO WHAT WILL THE DIRTY LINEN 
LOOK LIKE UNDER THEIR ADDITIONAL 
COSTS ALLOWANCE M. P.'S CAN CLAIM UP 
TO TWENTY THREE THOUSAND A YEAR TOWARDS A SECOND 
RESIDENCE THE ALLOWANCE COVERS 
EXPENDITURE INCURRED WHEN AN M. P. IS 
AWAY FROM HOME ON PARLIAMENTARY 
DUTIES SUCH AS THE COST OF 
FURNITURE AND HOUSEHOLD BILLS THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS AUTHORITIES HAVE 
BEEN GIVEN UNTIL FOUR O'CLOCK P. M. NEXT FRIDAY 
TO RELEASE A DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF 
THE EXPENSES AND THEY HAVE UNTIL 
LUNCHTIME ON TUESDAY TO DECIDE 
WHETHER TO LAUNCH AN APPEAL 
SERVICE COULD BE INTERESTING KEVIN 
LET ME JUST SAY WHAT THE JUDGE SAID 
ABOUT IT HE SAID THE EXPENDITURE 
OF PUBLIC MONEY THROUGH NP'S 
SALARIES AND ALLOWANCES IS A MATTER 
OF REASONABLE INTEREST TO TAX 
PAYERS THAT SOUNDS PERFECTLY FIT 
TO ME CAN YOU SEE MICHAEL MARTIN 
BE UNABLE TO CHALLENGE THAT NO NO PUBLISH AND BE DAMNED M. P.'S DON'T 
SEE THEMSELVES AS OTHER PEOPLE SEE 
THEM AND IF THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO 
HIDE UNLESS THEY COME CLEAN 
IT'S ALL WITHIN THE RULES 
SUPPOSEDLY 
THE RULES ARE SUPPOSEDLY INCREDIBLY FLEXIBLE AS WE KNOW 
YOU CAN SPEND MONEY ON YOUR DOOR 
CHIMES FOR GOODNESS SAKE MICHAEL 
MARTIN AND WHOEVER THEY ARE 
SPENDING MORE PUBLIC MONEY FUNDING 
THIS 
APPARENTLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF PUBLIC THIS MONEY SO FAR ON THIS 
THE PUBLIC 
CLAMOUR WILL NOT GO AWAY THEY WILL 
ALL BE TARRED WITH THE SAME BRUSH 
AS FOR A SECURITY RISK I SUPPOSE 
THE REAL RISK WILL GO TO THEIR 
NEIGHBOURS BECAUSE HOUSE PRICES 
WILL PLUMMET 
IF YOU WANT TO FIND 
OUT IT DOES HAVE THESE PEOPLE 
THERE ARE WAYS TO DO IT AS THE 
JUDGE SAID 
EVEN THE WORST REPORT 
ON THE WORST NEWSPAPER CAN PROBABLY 
FIND AN ADDRESS IT IS ABSURD L. 
DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE THE 
ADDRESSES BUT YOU DO NEED TO HAVE 
THE EXPENDITURE PEOPLE WHO PASS 
THINGS LIKE THE TEN P. TAX HAVE NO 
IDEA OF THE WAY THEIR CONSTITUENCY 
LIVES AND IT'S ONLY BECAUSE THERE 
HAS BEEN A HUGE ROW IN THEIR 
CONSTITUENCIES BUT THEY HAVE 
SUDDENLY NOW PANICKED BUT THEY 
PANIC A BIT TOO LATE MICHAEL MICHAEL MARTIN IS IN CHARGE OF REVEALING 
M. P.S' EXPENSES PRESUMABLY KEVIN 
THIS WILL MEAN HE IS GOING TO HAVE 
TO BE PRETTY OPEN ABOUT DISCLOSURE 
NOW 
HE WILL BUT THE PROBLEM NOW MICHAEL MARTIN HAS IS BECAUSE HE 
HAS GOT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE 
REVIEWS OF M. P.'S HIS WIFE HAS BEEN 
CLEARED OF USING TAXES HE SHOULD 
SET HIMSELF UP AS THE DEFENDER OF 
PUBLIC INTEREST HE HAS CALLED THIS 
WRONG AND HE IS TAKING THE RAP WE WE WILL SEE HOW THIS STORY DEVELOPS ON 
TUESDAY AND FRIDAY 
ALMOST TWO WEEKS ON FROM THE 
DEVASTATING CYCLONE WHICH HIT BURMA 
IN SOUTH EAST ASIA AID AGENCIES 
ARE WARNING TODAY THAT AS MANY AS 
TWO AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE ARE 
IN NEED OF URGENT ASSISTANCE THIS 
WEEK GORDON BROWN SAID THE 
EMERGENCY WAS NOW MAN MADE AS THE 
MILITARY LEADERS OF BURMA HAVE 
STYMIED ATTEMPTS BY FOREIGN AID 
WORKERS TO GET TO THE IRRAWADDY 
DELTA REGION DAVID CAMERON PRESSED 
THE PRIME MINISTER ON WEDNESDAY TO 
TAKE FURTHER STEPS TO HELP THE 
BURMESE PEOPLE 
I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE UPDATE 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS GIVEN US HE 
HAS RIGHTLY SAID THAT THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT MUST LET AID THROUGH 
BUT CAN I PUSH AND BIT MORE ON IF 
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IS HE PREPARED 
TO TAKE FURTHER STEPS 
RAISING THE ISSUE OF THE 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT AT THE 
UN UN THE PRIME MINISTER RESPONDED BY 
SAYING IT WAS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE 
PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT OF COURSE AT THE UNITED NATIONS 
WE WILL RAISE THE ISSUE OF 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT WE LEAVE 
OURSELVES OPEN TO CONSIDER THE 
POSSIBILITY OF IT DROPS EVERYBODY 
WHO WAS ON THE GROUND AND EVERY AID 
AGENCY ADVISING US SAYS THE BEST 
WAY OF GETTING AID QUICKLY TO 
BURMESE PEOPLE IS TO CONTINUE 
PRESSURE ON THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT 
GORDON BROWN SPEAKING AT PMQS ON 
WEDNESDAY WE CAN TALK NOW TO THE 
B. B. C.'S ANDREW HARDING WHO IS IN 
THAILAND WHERE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS 
ARE NOW FOCUSED ANDREW A BIT ON 
THAT IN A MOMENT BUT WHAT OF THE 
AID AGENCIES TELLING YOU ON THE 
GROUND ABOUT HOW MUCH HELP IS ABLE 
TO GET THROUGH 
THEY ARE NOT 
GETTING NEARLY ENOUGH HELP THAT'S 
THE MAIN PROBLEM THEY ARE FACING ON 
THE GROUND A LOT OF RAIN IN THE 
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS THAT'S MAKING 
MATTERS VERY DIFFICULT 
RESTRICTIONS ARE BEING IMPOSED ON 
THE DELTA BY THE BURMESE MILITIA 
NOT ALLOWING TEAMS IN A LOT OF 
PEOPLE STILL LIVING OUT IN THE OPEN 
IN VERY VERY GRIM CONDITIONS 
URGENTLY NEEDING HELP SOME AID IS 
CERTAINLY GETTING THROUGH EVERY 
DAY MORE PEOPLE ARE BEING REACHED 
AND MORE AID IS GETTING THROUGH 
AID AGENCIES ARE SAYING IN THE END 
WE WILL BE ABLE TO MUDDLE THROUGH 
SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER PEOPLE ARE 
STILL WAITING FOR THIS POTENTIAL 
SPIKE A NEW WAVE OF DEATHS 
CHOLERA OR TYPHOID OR ANY OTHER 
DISEASES START TO GET HOLD IN SOME 
OF THESE VERY GRIM CONDITIONS IN 
THESE CAMPS 
I MENTION THE 
DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS ON GOING L. 
UNDERSTAND THERE IS A SUMMIT NEXT 
WEEK TO TRY AND KICK START THINGS 
THAT'S A SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE AND 
MINISTERS FROM REGIONAL COUNTRIES 
IN SOUTH EAST ASIA WILL BE THERE 
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING 
FOR A LOT OF LEADERSHIP FROM THEM 
BECAUSE THESE ARE THE COUNTRIES 
WHICH HAVE THE BEST CONTACTS AND 
PERHAPS THE BEST RELATIONS WITH THE 
GENERALS INSIDE BURMA SO I THINK 
THERE IS REAL HOPE THESE 
COUNTRIES CAN MAKE A BREAKTHROUGH 
AND AT LEAST GET SOME MORE MYSTICAL 
TEAMS INSIDE BURMA WHETHER OR NOT 
THEY CAN MAKE MASSIVE 
BREAKTHROUGH IT'S LOOKING 
INCREASINGLY UNLIKELY PEOPLE FEEL 
THAT CERTAINLY THE LEADERSHIP IN 
BURMA REMAINS VERY HARD LINE EVEN 
IF SOME OF THE MORE JUNIOR GENERALS 
AND OFFICIALS ON THE GROUND DO SEEM 
TO RECOGNISE THAT THEY CAN'T DO 
THIS ON THEIR OWN 
I ANDREW THANKS 
BY MUCH FOR JOINING US WE'VE BEEN 
JOINED BY THE MINISTER FOR 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT GARETH 
THOMAS WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE 
THAT AID IS STARTING TO GET THROUGH 
TO WHERE IT IS NEEDED 
WE HAD A 
FLIGHT WHICH WE PACKED WITH SOME 
RELIEF SURPRISE WHICH WE HAD 
STOPPED IN THE REGION WHICH WAS 
ABLE TO LAND EARLIER THIS WEEK AND 
WE HAVE GOT ANOTHER FOUR FLIGHTS 
GOING IN OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS WE ARE SEEING IN 
THAT VERY DIRECT WAY EVIDENCE THAT 
AID IS GETTING THROUGH 
IS IT BEING 
DISSEMINATED AROUND THE COUNTRY BY 
N. G. O.'S ALL BEEN DISTRIBUTED BY THE 
BURMESE MILITIA 
NO IT'S THROUGH 
THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME OR BRITISH 
N. G. O. S. OR THEIR PARTNERS IN THE 
REGION NONE OF THE AID OF MONEY WE 
ARE GIVING OR HAVE SET ASIDE TO PAY 
FOR THE COSTS OF RESPONDING TO THIS 
DISASTER GOES TO THE BURMESE JUNTA 
IT'S GOING TO ORGANISATIONS WE HAVE 
WORKED WITH FOR LONG PERIOD OF TIME 
AND WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEM THAT 
IT WILL GET THROUGH TO THE AREAS 
IT'S NEEDED 
WHY CAN'T YOU DO MORE 
IF THE CHANNELS ARE THERE WHAT'S 
THE PROBLEM 
AS YOUR REPORTER SAID 
WE NEED MORE TRAINED 
HELP US IN THE AREAS HIT BY THE 
CYCLONE ABLE TO DISPERSE MUCH MORE 
QUICKLY THAN A ABLE TO DO AT THE 
MOMENT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF AID 
WORKERS THAT'S WHY WE ARE FRANKLY 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE WAY VISAS ARE 
BEING STOPPED FOR HUMANITARIANS TO 
GET INTO THE COUNTRY WE HAVE BEEN 
PRESSING THE POLITE AND 
ALL SOUNDS VERY POLITE AND DIPLOMATIC WHAT ABOUT DAVID 
CAMERON'S POINT IT HAS GONE BEYOND 
THE NICETIES AND WE NEED TO DO 
SOMETHING MUCH MORE DRAMATIC 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS 
WELL WE ARE 
PRESSING HARD ON THE DIPLOMATIC 
FRONT AND THERE WILL BE 
DISCUSSIONS NEXT WEEK IN THE UNITED 
NATIONS ON THIS ISSUE WE ACCEPT WE 
NEED TO DO MORE WHICH IS WHY WE'VE 
GOT MORE FLIGHTS GOING IN THERE 
HAS BEEN A SUGGESTION THAT WE 
SHOULD DROP AID IN AS MOST N. G. O. S. 
ARE SAYING THERE ARE HUGE PROBLEMS 
AND RISKS WITH IT DROPS YOU CAN'T 
FOR EXAMPLE DROPPED SAFE DRINKING 
WATER WHICH IS ONE OF THE KEY 
NEEDS IT DROPS ARE NOT THE MAGIC 
SOLUTION WHAT IS NEEDED IS BETTER 
HUMANITARIAN ACCESS AND THAT'S WHY 
WE ARE PRESSING THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES AS HARD AS WE ARE YOU YOU WON'T DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT 
YOU WILL STILL GO DOWN THE 
DIPLOMATIC CHANNEL YOU WON'T DO 
ANYTHING TO BYPASS THAT 
WE ARE 
TRYING TO DO PRESS THE DIPLOMATIC 
ROUTE BUT ALSO WORKING DIRECTLY 
WITH AID ORGANISATIONS ON THE 
GROUND THAT HAVE ACCESS AND ARE 
ABLE TO GET PAID INTO THE REGION 
SUCH AS THE UN'S WORLD FOOD 
PROGRAMME AND THE BRITISH N. G. O. S. WE 
HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY 
WE HAVE GIVEN TO THOSE 
ORGANISATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE 
BEGINNING TO BE ABLE TO GET MORE 
AID THROUGH AS YOUR REPORTER QUITE 
RIGHTLY SAID THE KEY TO MAKING 
SURE EVERYBODY HAS THE ACCESS TO 
THIS IS FOR THE BURMESE JUNTA TO 
GIVE ACCESS 
IS THIS THE RIGHT 
ATTITUDE 
I THINK THE GOVERNMENT ATTITUDE SHOULD TURN UP THE VOLUME BUT IT'S 
VERY HARD TO SEE WHAT ELSE THEY CAN 
DO THE BURMESE REGIME IS 
XENOPHOBIC WE HAVE GOT TO PUT 
PRESSURE ON THAILAND CHINA AND 
OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES MIKE BROWN 
IS IN ASIA NOW TRYING TO DO THAT L. 
LIKE THE SIMPLICITY OF THE IDEA OF 
EAR DROPS BUT OF COURSE IT 
WOULDN'T WORK 
QUITE OFTEN IT 
KILLS THE PEOPLE YOU'RE TRYING TO 
SAVE BECAUSE IF YOU DO A JOB AND 
IT HAPPENED IN THE BALKANS AND 
NORTHERN IRAQ PEOPLE RUSHED 
TOWARDS WHATEVER IS COMING DOWN AND 
SOMETIMES THEY ARE KNOCKED OUT BUT 
ALSO IT MEANS THE MOST CORRUPT 
ENERGETIC TEND TO GET THE AID AND 
NOT THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT IT'S A 
LOVELY ROMANTIC IDEA BUT IT CAN'T 
WORK 
QUITE A CONTRAST WITH 
THE WAY WORK THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES ARE DEALING 
WITH THE HER QUICK EARTH QUAKE 
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY THE FIRST AND I 
WENT TO CHINA WAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN IN A 
NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX THERE WAS A GREAT EARTHQUAKE 
WHICH PEOPLE REFER BACK TO THE 
BIGGEST ONE EVER THINK TO 
AND AND FIFTY THOUSAND DIED THE CHINESE HAVE 
BEN REFUSED TO ADMIT IT HAD 
HAPPENED A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DIED THE 
CHINESE REFUSED TO ADMIT IT HAD 
HAPPENED BUT CHINESE PSYCHOLOGICAL 
MYTHOLOGY SOMETIMES IT IS HUGE 
NATURAL DISASTER THEY TURN AGAINST 
THE GOVERNMENT BANNED WHAT HAPPENED 
WAS CHAIRMAN MAO DIED THE GANG OF 
FOUR WERE ARRESTED AND PEOPLE LIKE 
ME WERE LET IN OF COURSE IT 
FRIGHTENS THE BURMESE BECAUSE IF 
THEY OPEN THEIR DOORS WHO KNOWS 
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN 
GARETH IS THERE 
A TIME LIMIT ON A DIPLOMATIC 
CHANNELS AT SOME POINT IF THIS 
GOES ON AND ON DO YOU SAY ENOUGH 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THINGS INTO 
OUR OWN HANDS 
I THINK WE HAVE TO 
MAINTAIN THE DIPLOMATIC ROUTE 
BECAUSE IN THE END THE BEST THING 
WOULD BE TO HAVE THE CO OPERATION 
OF THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES 
IF THE 
BEST THING CAN'T BE ACHIEVED WE WE ARE SEEING PROGRESS AS YOUR 
REPORTER MADE CLEAR THE WORLD FOOD 
PROGRAMME IS GETTING ACCESS AID 
AGENCIES HAVE RELIEF WORKERS WHO 
HAVE BEEN IN BURMA FOR A LONG TIME 
AND ARE BEING ALLOWED TO OPERATE 
WE NEED TO OPEN THAT UP AND GET 
MORE PEOPLE INTO THE AFFECTED AREAS 
GARETH THOMAS THANKS BY MUCH FOR 
JOINING US 
AMIDST ALL THE PROBLEMS FOR GORDON 
BROWN THAT HAVE BEEN PILING UP OVER 
THE PAST FEW WEEKS LITTLE 
ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE BIGGEST 
REBELLION OF HIS PREMIERSHIP THIRTY EIGHT 
LABOUR BACKBENCHERS DEFIED THE 
GOVERNMENT WHIP TO VOTE WITH THE 
CONSERVATIVES IN FAVOUR OF 
SOMETHING CALLED FEED IN TARIFF 
ESSENTIALLY SET TARIFF PAID TO 
SMALL SCALE PRODUCERS OF 
ELECTRICITY TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO 
INVEST IN RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGY THE 
GOVERNMENT WON THE DAY THE 
AMENDMENT FOR THE TARIFF WAS 
DEFEATED BUT THE ISSUE WILL RETURN 
TO PARLIAMENT LATER THIS YEAR SO 
WHAT'S ALL THE FUSS ABOUT GILES 
HAS BEEN TO SOMERSET TO MEET A 
FEED IN TARIFF ENTHUSIAST 
DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE CHOCOLATE 
BOX LOVELINESS AND THE WISTERIA 
BLOOMS THIS IS OFFICIALLY A BIG 
POWER STATION WELCOME TO THE WORLD 
OF MICRO HYDRO YOU ARE THINKING 
PICTURESQUE CONVERTED WATER MILL 
YOU'RE EXPECTING TO SEE BIG WHEEL 
AREN'T YOU NOT HOW IT WORKS HERE 
THIS PROPELLER DRIVES THIS YELLOW 
WHEEL WHICH DRIVES THE BELT WHICH 
GOES TO THE GENERATOR AND WE ARE 
GENERATING ELECTRICITY TWENTY 
KILOWATTS AT THE MOMENT BEFORE THE 
RAIN THIS MORNING IT WAS SEVENTEEN WATER 
COMES OUT AT THE OTHER END THERE 
ARE NO EMISSIONS THE PLACE STILL 
LOOKS BEAUTIFUL AND YOU HAVE 
POWERED SIXTY FIVE ROOMS SOUNDS SIMPLE 
AND IT SHOULD BE BUT IT ISN'T 
JUST GETTING TELLISFORD UP AND 
RUNNING HAS BEEN SOMETHING OF AN 
UPSTREAM BATTLE 
A PLAN 
WAS TO MAKE AS MUCH 
ELECTRICITY AS WE COULD THIS SITE 
USED TO BE THE BIGGEST MALE ON THE 
RIVER HARNESSING ENERGY FOR THE 
ONE AND INDUSTRY MEAL WE 
THOUGHT THAT IF WE WERE GOING TO 
EXPLOITED WE SHOULD MAKE AS MUCH 
ELECTRICITY AS WE COULD DO 
EXPORTING MOST OF IT TO THE GRID 
MILL 
HOW COMPLICATED HAS IT BEEN MILL BEING PART OF THE GRID X. FACTOR IT IT IS QUITE COMPLICATED THAT IS ONE 
OF THE DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE HAD TO 
OVERCOME BEING PART OF THE GRADE 
A ETC THE SYSTEM MAKES IT QUITE 
DIFFICULT AT THE MOMENT 
APART FROM 
THE BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEM JUST 
GETTING PAID IS A MINEFIELD IT IS 
A WORLD OF BLOCKS TRI AD PAYMENTS 
R. O. C.'S LECS AND OTHER THINGS IT IS 
NOT SURPRISING THAT SOME OF THOSE 
WHO MIGHT DO THIS U. M. P. 
THERE ARE 
MEMBERS OF THE GROUP WHO FIND IT 
EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING AND FRANKLY 
OF PUTTING THE THOUGHT OF HAVING 
TO GO THROUGH LENGTHY DISCUSSIONS 
AND NEGOTIATIONS AND TO PRODUCE 
LOTS AND LOTS OF INFORMATION IT 
PUTS PEOPLE OFF YES WE ARE TOLD 
ALMOST DAILY OF THE URGENCY TO CUT 
EMISSIONS 
POLITICIANS WANT TO BE EMISSIONS EVER GREENER BUT THE SYSTEM SEEMS 
NOT TO HAVE THE SAME AIM MANY MILL 
OWNERS AND THERE ARE FEW ONE THOUSAND YOU 
MAY BE SURPRISED TO LEARN WANT 
INCENTIVES TO GET INVOLVED A FIXED 
SIMPLIFIED SOME OR FEED IN TARIFF 
THE FEED IN TARIFF HAS TWO BIG 
ATTRACTIONS THE FIRST ONE IS THAT 
IT IS SIMPLER YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING 
PAID THE SECOND IS THAT IT IS A 
GUARANTEE 
WITH A SIMPLE GUARANTEE GUARANTEE YOU CAN BORROW MONEY TO DEVELOP 
YOUR WATER MILL IT IS AS SIMPLE AS 
THAT BUT SIMPLE HYDRO SEEMS NOT TO 
BE IN THE BUREAUCRATIC MINDSET WE WE WERE AT A MEETING WITH THE CABINET 
OFFICE A YEAR OR TWO BACK WHERE WE 
TALK WITH THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY 
AND WITH THE FISHERIES PEOPLE WE 
SAID EUROPE HAS BEEN GENERATING 
FROM HYDRO FOR DONKEY'S YEARS WHY 
DON'T YOU GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT 
EUROPE SEE HOW THEY DO IT BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE BEEN MAKING IT WORK FOR A 
LONG TIME DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY 
SAY TO US WOULD ALL LIKE A 
JOLLY TO EUROPE COME ON BOYS 
GROW UP 
UNFORTUNATELY THE ENERGY 
MINISTER WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO SPEAK 
TO US BUT WE HAVE BEEN JOINED BY 
THE SHADOW ENVIRONMENT SECRETARY 
FOR THE CONSERVATIVES PETER 
AINSWORTH TELL US A LITTLE BIT 
MORE ABOUT THESE FEED IN TARIFFS 
WHY ARE THEY SUCH A GOOD IDEA 
I AM 
REALLY PLEASED THAT YOUR FILM 
EXPLAINED WHAT FEED IN TARIFFS CAR 
IT IS VERY SIMPLE IT IS CAPABLE OF 
REVOLUTIONISING THE WAY WE DO POWER 
IN THIS COUNTRY ARE ALSO 
HELPING PEOPLE TO SAVE ENERGY 
WATTAGES IS ESSENTIALLY 
GUARANTEEING A LONG TERM PRICE TO 
ANYONE WHO SPENDS THE MONEY WHAT 
IT IS TO INSTALL A PIECE OF 
RENEWABLE OR MICRO ENERGY 
GENERATION IN THEIR HOME OR AMONGST 
THEIR COMMUNITY OR A LOCAL SCHOOL 
OR WHATEVER THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF 
APPLICATIONS AT THE MOMENT IT IS 
REALLY COMPLICATED AND BUREAUCRATIC 
THE PAYBACK IS UNCERTAIN THE 
UPFRONT INVESTMENT IS PRETTY LARGE 
THE SCALE THAT THEY HAVE GOT IN 
PLACES LIKE GERMANY AND DENMARK AND 
HOLLAND IS NOT HERE IN OUR COUNTRY 
AND THE OFFICIAL CONSERVATIVE 
POLICY 
WE HAVE PUBLISHED THIS POLICY DOCUMENT SO WE WERE DELIGHTED WHEN 
OVER TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT 
SIGNED A MOTION SUPPORTING THIS 
POLICY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT REJECTED IT 
I AM GLAD 
WE HAVE PIN YOU DOWN ON THE 
OFFICIAL SIDE OF THE POLICY WITH 
THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD ALL 
THESE TINY LITTLE MICRA GENERATION 
PROJECTS IS NOT GOING TO FILL THE 
GAP CREATED BY NUCLEAR POWER 
STATIONS COMING OUT OF STRING FOR 
EXAMPLE MICRO GENERATION SURELY 
YOU WILL HAVE TO EMBRACE SOMETHING 
LIKE NUCLEAR AT SOME POINT THE THE DISMAL A WHOLE ANSWER BUT IT IS A 
VERY SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL PART OF 
THE ANSWER IT ISN'T THE WHOLE 
ANSWER IN GERMANY FOR EXAMPLE 
THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED TIMES THE NUMBER OF 
SOLAR PANELS THAT WE HAVE GOT IN 
THIS COUNTRY TEN TIMES THE NUMBER 
OF WIND TURBINES L. DON'T THINK 
GERMANY IS THREE HUNDRED TIMES SUNNIER OR TEN 
TIMES WINDIER THAN BRITAIN SO 
SOMETHING IS WRONG HERE WE HAVE 
GOT A VERY OUTDATED OLD FASHIONED 
CENTRALISED WAY OF DOING THINGS IN 
THIS COUNTRY THIS IS AN AGE OF 
ENERGY SHORTAGE POTENTIALLY SO A 
WASTEFUL SYSTEM IS NOT AN 
ACCEPTABLE SYSTEM EVOLVING THIS 
INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES AND PEOPLE 
GETTING PAID TO DO THAT IS VERY 
MUCH PART OF THE SOLUTION 
IS THIS 
A GOOD IDEA OR IS IT SOMETHING 
WHICH IS JUST SORT OF QUITE MINOR 
AND A BIT GIMMICKY 
I THINK THE 
LONG TERM ANSWER IS PROBABLY A LOT 
OF WIND FARMS AND ALAS NUCLEAR 
POWER I THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA 
NOT EVERYONE OF COURSE HAS GOT A 
STREAM DOWN THE BOTTOM OF THEIR 
GARDEN AND DAVID CAMERON'S WIND 
TURBINE TURNED OUT TO BE A BIT OF A 
GIMMICK BUT SOLAR PANELS AND WIND 
TURBINES WORK AND WHY THERE CAN'T 
JUST BE A SIMPLE SYSTEM YOU PUT 
ELECTRICITY INTO THE GRID AND YOU 
TAKE IT OUT RATHER LIKE A BANK 
ACCOUNT 
MOST OF THE ENERGY ACCOUNT GENERATORS DON'T WANT IT BECAUSE 
THEY DO NOT WANT ALL OF THESEMM 
RIVALS 
WHAT IS THE JUSTIFICATION RIVALS FOR THE BUREAUCRACY AND THESE 
STRANGE MYSTERIOUS THINGS MOST 
PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO TRY AND 
STRUGGLE WITH THAT UNLESS THEY ARE 
VERY MIDDLE CLASS RETIRED AND 
WELL OFF AND FEEL LIKE 
CONGRATULATING THEMSELVES BEING BEING PART OF THE LOW CARBON REVOLUTION 
MUST NOT BE SEEN AS A PURELY 
MIDDLE CLASS ACTIVITY WE HAVE ALL 
GOT A ROLE TO PLAY 
ON THAT POINT 
WHETHER OR NOT IT IS GOING INTO THE 
MARGINS OF OUR WORRIES AT THE 
MOMENT WHAT WITH THE ECONOMY AND 
IMMIGRATION AND THE HEALTH SERVICE 
IS THERE NOT A DANGER THAT IF WHEN 
THE CONSERVATIVES COME TO POWER 
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SHUNT THESE 
GREENER POLICIES TOWARDS THE 
SIDELINES AND ACTUALLY MORE 
IMPORTANT THINGS ARE GOING TO TAKE 
PRECEDENCE 
YOU SAY MORE IMPORTANT PRECEDENCE BUT ACTUALLY DEALING WITH THESE 
MATTERS IS USUALLY IMPORTANT 
IT IS 
NOT SO IMPORTANT AS THE ECONOMY 
AMONGST VOTERS 
THIS IS ONLY PART 
OF WHAT WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT 
CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAMME THIS 
PROGRAMME WILL GIVE PEOPLE MONEY 
WILL PAY PEOPLE TO DO THEIR OWN 
THING TO BE PART OF REDUCING THEIR 
EMISSIONS AND SAVE ENERGY IF YOU 
LOOK AT WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN 
THE ENERGY MARKET IN THE YEARS 
AHEAD IT IS LIKELY TO BECOME AN 
INCREASING ISSUE FOR PEOPLE IN 
TERMS OF HOUSEHOLD BILLS 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN PETER 
AINSWORTH THIS WEEK HAS ALL BEEN 
ABOUT GORDON BROWN AND HIS 
ATTEMPTS TO GET HIS GOVERNMENT BACK 
ON TRACK HE HAS PRODUCED A 
SURPRISE TAX CUT OUTLINED NEW 
LEGISLATIVE BILLS AND HELD A HIGH 
PROFILE PRESS CONFERENCE BUT HAS 
IT DONE THE TRICK 
IT HAS TO BE SAYS IF GORDON BROWN 
WAS A ROCK STAR AND I THINK EVEN 
HE WOULD ADMIT THAT HE IS NOT HE 
WOULD BE VERY PLEASED WITH TOP OF 
THE POTS SOME GOOD STORIES SOME 
NOT SO GOOD AND YES OF THE 
SECOND WEEK RUNNING THE TEN P. TAX 
HAS GOT IN THERE ONCE AGAIN 
AT FIVE DOING THE ROUNDS AT 
WESTMINSTER AT THE MOMENT THERE 
WAS A DAPPER CHAP CALLED FIELD WHO 
SAW HOW MUCH CLOUT HE COULD WIELD 
NO ED BALLS DIDN'T LIKE IT EITHER 
AND TOLD HIM FRANKLY TO SHUT UP AT 
FOUR AS THE ECONOMY GETS SICKER 
WITH A RECENT BOUT OF MERVYN'S 
MONETARY MELANCHOLIA DOCTOR BROWN SAYS 
HE IS THE MEDICINE TO CURE OUR 
ECONOMIC ILLS THE G. P. PRESCRIBES 
PRUDENCE AND A DOSE OF THE BEE GEES 
THREE TIMES A DAY WHICH SHOULD 
LEAD TO LESS BELLY ACHING AT THREE 
ONE THING OUR PRIME MINISTER HAS 
INTRODUCED THAT NONE OF HIS 
PREDECESSORS DID WAS THE NEW HEADS 
UP ON LEGISLATION HE'LL BE PASSING 
SOON THIS NOT QUITE THE QUEEN'S 
SPEECH INCLUDED EIGHTEEN NOT ENTIRELY 
NEW MEASURES SIGNALLING THAT THEY 
NOT TOTALLY FIGHTBACK HAD STARTED 
CHERIE BLAIR IN BETWEEN TOO MUCH 
INFORMATION RELATES ANGRY GORDON 
WAVING KEYS TO NUMBER TEN AT TONY 
AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY 
ABOUT HER RUNNING OFF WITH THE 
BLOKE NEXT DOOR 
LORD LEVY SAYS 
GORDY MUST HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE 
LOAN AND PREZZA SAYS GORDON WAS 
PRICKLY ANNOYING FRUSTRATING AND 
BEWILDERING AND AT NUMBER ONE A 
BELEAGUERED P. M. THINKS A TAX CUT IS 
THE BEST FORM OF DEFENCE TWO POINT SEVEN 
BILLION IS BEING OFFERED IN 
COMPENSATION TO SUE FOR THOSE MOST 
HIT TO SOOTHE THOSE MOST IT THE SO A CLEAN SWEEP FOR MR. HAS 
HE 
NEUTRALISED QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS 
LEADERSHIP 
NO BUT I THINK HE IS LEADERSHIP IN BETTER SHAPE AT THE END OF THE 
WEEK THAN HE WAS AT THE BEGINNING 
YOU COULD SEE A HUGE WEIGHT LIFTED 
OFF THE SHOULDERS OF LABOUR M. P.'S 
OVER THE TEN P. TAX RATE YES THERE 
ARE QUESTION REMAINING BUT HE HE CANNOT KEEP GOING ON ABOUT DAVID 
CAMERON'S PROMISES BEING UNFUNDED 
WHAT IS THIS THE LATEST THING IT 
IS SO ON FUNDED IT IS AMAZING BUT BUT NOW THERE IS PRESSURE BUILDING ON 
CAMERON TO SAY WHY AREN'T YOU 
OFFERING TAX CUTS YES BUT IT IS 
VERY FUNNY YOU KNOW THAT GORDON 
HAS SAID THAT OR RATHER ROBERT 
GIBB OF THE BG'S HAS SAID THAT 
GORDON IS EXTREMELY PARTIAL TO THE 
BEACHES 
OF THE BEE GEES THESE BEACHES THESE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THEY NEED 
ANSWERING 
THE BIG ISSUES TALKING ANSWERING TALKING OF WHICH CREWE AND NANTWICH WE 
HAVE GOT NEXT WEEK HOW CRUCIAL FOR 
GORDON BROWN AND DAVID CAMERON I I THINK IT IS MORE CRUCIAL FOR GORDON 
BROWN AND DAVID CAMERON IF GORDON 
BROWN LOSES IT HE IS IN A PILE OF 
TROUBLE IF DAVID CAMERON DOESN'T 
WIN IT HE IS IN LESS TROUBLE IF IF CAMERON LOST ANOTHER WHAT IS 
CONSIDERED TO BE A FANTASTICALLY 
IMPORTANT CRUCIAL BY ELECTION HE 
DIDN'T WIN IT BUT THAT'S O. K. BUT 
NOW EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR 
ANOTHER NAIL IN THE COFFIN AND 
CREWE AND NANTWICH WILL BE IT I 
ASSUME SO ANYWAY NOBODY IS SAYING 
THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF 
THE ONLY POLL I HAVE SEEN IS THAT 
THE TORIES ARE SLIGHTLY AHEAD IT 
IS A BY ELECTION LOTS OF LOCAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES 
IT WILL BE CIRCUMSTANCES INTERESTING I'LL GET YOU TO STICK 
YOUR NECKS OUT FRANK FIELD SAID 
THAT HE DID NOTHING GORDON BROWN 
WOULD BE AROUND FOR THE NEXT 
ELECTION KEVIN DO YOU THINK HE 
WILL BE 
YEAH HE WILL L. THINK HE 
WILL BE BECAUSE ACTUALLY LABOUR 
IS NOT NEARLY AS RUTHLESS AT 
GETTING RID OF DUFF LEADERS AS THE 
TORIES ARE 
AND THEIR LEADERSHIP 
SYSTEM MAKES IT QUITE HARD 
YES I 
THINK THAT IS A RED HERRING 
BECAUSE TONY BLAIR WENT WITHOUT TWENTY PER CENT 
OF M. P.'S SAYING OFF YOU GO BUT I 
JUST THINK THERE IS NO ONE REALLY 
WHO IS STANDING OUT TO CHALLENGE 
HIM THE OTHER THING IS YOU DON'T 
JUST BECOME UP PERMANENTLY BAD 
POLITICIAN OVERNIGHT HE HAS GOT TO 
GET THAT CONFIDENCE BACK 
A THING 
HE HAS LOST THAT BUT I DO THINK HE 
GOOD TAKE US INTO THE NEXT ELECTION 
I THINK THEY HUNG ON TO MICHAEL 
FOOT FOR YEARS 
WE HAVE GOT YOUR 
OPINIONS ON RECORD NOW WE MUST 
LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOR JOINING ME THAT'S IT FOR THIS 
WEEK I'LL BE BACK ON MONDAY IN 
THE MEANTIME I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH 
IMAGES OF ANOTHER BIG POLITICAL 
STORY IN THE MAKING FURIOUS 
CAMPAIGNING ON THE STREETS OF CREWE 
AND NANTWICH AS GORDON BROWN AND 
HIS TEAM ARE FIGHTING TO WIN NEXT 
WEEK'S BY ELECTION BYE BYE
