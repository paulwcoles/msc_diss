THE HARDEST THING ABOUT BEING A SINGLE MUM IS JUGGLING EVERYTHING 
WORK STILL HAVE TIME WITH YOUR SON STILL LOOK AFTER YOURSELF 
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BACK UP IT'S JUST YOU 
THEY SAY IT'S TOUGH SO WHO CAN THEY TURN TO FOR HELP 
EACH OTHER 
IN AN AMBITIOUS SOCIAL EXPERIMENT 
TEN SINGLE MUMS AND THEIR KIDS HAVE SET UP HOME IN A MANSION IN RURAL SOMERSET 
THEY WANT TO SEE IF LIVING TOGETHER CAN BRING BENEFITS LIFE AS A SINGLE MUM JUST CAN'T 
THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER FOR THREE WEEKS 
IN THIS PROGRAMME WE LOOK BACK OVER THE EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW DAYS 
WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM THE MUMS' FRIENDS AND FAMILY 
BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO BY ANOTHER WOMAN I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO GO DOWN TOO WELL 
DOES NOT ANYONE UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM GOING MEANS 
SHE CAN BE CATTY OR BITCHY BUT I SUPPOSE ALL GIRLS ARE 
IF SHE PERCEIVES SOMEONE ISN'T PLAYING THE GAME I THINK SHE WILL HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT IT 
DON'T MAKE US DO THIS WHEN WE DON'T NEED TO DO IT 
I AM COMPLETELY NAKED 
THIS COUNTRY HOUSE IS A LOT MORE THAN HOME TO ITS TWENTY TWO INHABITANTS 
IT'S THE SITE OF A QUEST FOR ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF LIVING 
EACH WEEK ONE OF THE MUMS TAKES A TURN AS HOUSE LEADER AND GETS TO RUN THE PLACE IN THEIR OWN WAY 
ON A SATURDAY MORNING HALFWAY THROUGH THEIR TIME IN THE MANSION A NEW LEADER WAS ABOUT TO TAKE OVER 
ANXIOUS IS NOT THE WORD 
PETRIFIED 
WHEN SHE HAS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY SHE SHOUTS IT AND SAYS NO A LOT AND STAMPS HER FEET 
I AM STRUGGLING WITH THE CONCEPT THAT SHE IS LEADER 
MY INSTINCT IS TO BE SCARED 
THE CAUSE OF THE UNEASE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD TASHA GARDENER FROM BATH 
I CAN IMAGINE PEOPLE'S FIRST IMPRESSION OF TASHA BEING A BIT 
WHOA O. K. WE'VE GOT QUITE A STRONG CHARACTER HERE 
SHE BEGAN LIFE AS A SINGLE MUM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN HER MARRIAGE CAME TO AN END 
NOW SHE LIVES IN RENTED ACCOMMODATION WITH HER FIVE YEAR OLD SON RORY 
TASHA WORKS PART TIME IN A GUEST HOUSE 
IN THE MANSION SHE PROVED TO BE A TRICKY CUSTOMER 
WINDING UP MOST OF THE OTHER MUMS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER 
BEING A LEADER SHE WOULD WORRY WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT HER 
EVERYONE SEEMS TO HAVE ATTITUDE 
IF I AM GOING TO GET ATTITUDE THEN EVERYONE IS GOING TO GET ATTITUDE BACK 
AS YOU ALL KNOW I AM YOUR LEADER FOR THE NEXT FOUR DAYS 
TASHA'S FIRST DECISION WAS TO INTRODUCE A VOLUNTARY SYSTEM FOR THE HOUSEHOLD CHORES 
A RISKY APPROACH TO A PROBLEM NO ONE HAD MANAGED TO MASTER 
IF YOU GUYS WANT TO LIVE IN A PIT FOR THE NEXT FOUR DAYS THAT IS UP TO YOU 
SHE HAD SOMETHING FAR MORE CONTROVERSIAL TO ANNOUNCE 
MY THEME FOR THE NEXT FOUR DAYS IS SELF ESTEEM AND CONFIDENCE 
WE'RE GOING TO DO A SINGLE MUMS NUDE CALENDAR 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PHOTO SHOOT ON DAY FOUR 
YOU HAVE BASICALLY THREE DAYS TO THINK OVER IT AND MAKE YOUR DECISION WHETHER YOU WANT TO DO IT 
WHEN YOU SAY HAVE YOUR PICTURE TAKEN IN THE NUDE HOW DO YOU MEAN 
IN WHAT RESPECT 
I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING 
PERSONALLY I WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE HER IN THE NUDE 
SHE IS LIKE MY ADOPTED SISTER SO I DON'T REALLY THINK OF IT LIKE THAT 
I WOULDN'T LIKE TO THINK THAT SHE WOULD 
I WOULD RATHER THAT SHE DIDN'T DO A NUDE PHOTO SHOOT YEAH 
AFTER SHE'S HAD A FEW DRINKS SHE'LL BE FINE 
THAT'S ONE THING SHE WILL PROBABLY DRAW THE LINE AT 
THIS IS MY BODY AND IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE 
I WILL BE KEEPING IT TO MYSELF 
THE CALENDAR IS FOR YOU 
NO IT'S NOT FOR SOMEBODY BEHIND THE CAMERA TO SEE IT'S MINE 
GOT A TINY BIT OF A HIP THERE 
SHE'S GOT A BLANKET ON I DON'T CARE SHE HAS STILL GOT HER TOP OFF 
SHE IS A VERY EMOTIONAL PERSON MY SISTER EVEN THOUGH SHE COMES ACROSS THAT SHE'S NOT BUT SHE CAN BE 
IF SOMETHING TOUCHES A NERVE SHE CAN GET UPSET 
WHEN YOU'RE TOLD FROM EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT YOU'RE FAT AND UGLY 
I WOULD SAY THAT'S GOING TO STICK IN YOUR HEAD 
I AM NOT DOING IT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE PART IN IT 
SABITA WAS NOT THE ONLY MUM TO HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THE PROJECT 
I WILL NEVER EVER EVER EVER DO THIS IN A MILLION YEARS 
TASHA'S OTHER INNOVATION DIDN'T GET OFF TO A GOOD START EITHER 
AS AN OBVIOUS FLAW IN A VOLUNTARY SYSTEM FOR HOUSEHOLD CHORES SOON BECAME APPARENT 
THIS IS JUST LEFT ON THE TABLE YOU CHOOSE A ROOM AND DO IT OR 
JUST DON'T CHOOSE A ROOM AND DON'T DO ANYTHING 
I WAS GOING TO DO THAT OPTION 
I WAS GOING TO NOT DO A THING 
I THOUGHT O. K. I WILL LET ALL THE LAZY ONES TAKE OVER FUNNY ENOUGH THEY DON'T 
ROBYN WILL PROBABLY SIT BACK AND WATCH SOMEBODY ELSE DO IT FOR HER 
ROBYN WILL DRIVE THEM ROUND THE TWIST 
WITH NEITHER OF TASHA'S IDEAS PROVING POPULAR 
THE NEW LEADER APPEARED TO BE HEADING FOR A ROCKY RIDE 
I THINK TASHA WOULD BE QUITE UPSET IF ALL THE OTHER MUMS 
SAID SHE WASN'T A GOOD LEADER I THINK THAT WOULD UPSET HER 
SHE WON'T SHOW THAT SHE IS UPSET OR SHE'LL TRY NOT TO 
KEEN TO MAKE HER LEADERSHIP WORK TASHA HAD ONE MORE SCHEME UP HER SLEEVE 
SHE'D ARRANGED FOR SOME OF THE MUMS TO MEET WITH A CONFIDENCE COUNSELLOR THE FOLLOWING DAY 
AND WANTED ROBYN IN PARTICULAR TO ATTEND 
THIS MEANT THE ANXIOUS MOTHER HAD TO TRUST ONE OF THE OTHER SINGLE MUMS WITH BABY CARE 
NO OFFENCE BUT I REALLY WOULDN'T FEEL RIGHT O. K. THAT'S FINE 
NOT YOU JUST TWO BABIES THAT'S FINE 
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO 
IT'S NOT THAT 
I DON'T FEEL CONFIDENT WITH YOU WITH TWO BABIES 
BECAUSE TASH LIKES TO UNDERSTAND PEOPLE AND SHE LIKES TO HELP PEOPLE 
SHE IS ALSO A VERY GOOD LISTENER SO SHE CAN BE A GOOD PEACEMAKER 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S STARTING TO GET TO THE POINT 
WHERE WE'RE USING KELCI FOR AN EXCUSE NOT TO DO ANYTHING IT'S NOT THAT 
NATASHA IS VERY GOOD AT GIVING HER OPINIONS 
SHE WON'T HOLD BACK IF SHE'S GOT AN OPINION ON SOMETHING YOU WILL HEAR IT FROM HER 
EVER SINCE THIS MORNING ALL IT HAS BEEN IS 
CAN'T LEAVE KELCI CAN'T LEAVE KELCI 
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH NOT WANTING TO DO ANYTHING YOU LOT ARE USED TO LEAVING YOUR KIDS I'M NOT 
AS LEADER TASHA REALISED THAT ROBYN'S RELUCTANCE TO TRUST THE OTHER MUMS 
AFTER MORE THAN TWO WEEKS IN THE HOUSE TOGETHER IS BEGINNING TO ALIENATE HER FROM THE GROUP 
SHE EITHER HAS TO SERIOUSLY PULL HER FINGER OUT 
AND SAY I AM PART OF THIS FAMILY AND I AM GOING TO TAKE PLACE IN THIS FAMILY AND DO MY BIT 
OR SHE HAS TO SERIOUSLY THINK ABOUT HER PLACE IN THIS HOUSE 
AND IF SHE'S NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE SHE NEEDS TO GIVE IT UP 
SUNDAY MORNING BUT THERE WAS NO LIE IN FOR THE LEADER 
IT WAS TIME TO TAKE THE MUMS ON THE CONFIDENCE COURSE 
BUT ROBYN HAD OTHER IDEAS 
I AM NOT GOING TO THIS COUNSELLING THING TODAY 
MY HEART'S NOT GOING TO BE IN THIS COUNSELLING THING IF I AM THERE 
PANICKING ABOUT KELCI BECAUSE I NEED TO LEAVE KELCI HERE 
EVERY TIME 
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THERE'S ABOUT FIFTY MILLION EXCUSES 
IF THEY 
PUSH HER TOO FAR TO DO SOMETHING SHE WOULD JUST GET IN A STROP 
SHE CAN BE A BIT OF A PAIN WHEN IT COMES TO BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO 
I HOPE SHE GETS ON REALLY WELL WITH EVERYONE AND IT WILL BE FINE 
AND SHE'LL HAVE A SMOOTH TIME THERE 
BUT IT'S ROBYN I'M NOT SURE 
IT CAN TURN OUT TWO WAYS GOOD OR BAD 
I DON'T WANT THINGS TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE BASICALLY WE ALL TURN 
ROUND TO YOU AND SAY WHAT IS THE POINT OF YOUR PLACE IN THE HOUSE 
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING IN THIS HOUSE THERE IS NO POINT IN YOU BEING HERE 
I AM LEAVING IT UP TO YOU BECAUSE IT IS UP TO YOU 
THE ONLY REASON WHY WE ARE BEING SO TOUGH ON YOU IS BECAUSE WE WANT YOU 
TO BE PART OF THE GROUP AND WE WANT YOU TO GET LOADS OF THINGS OUT OF THE GROUP 
RIGHT 
LEAVING ROBYN BACK AT THE MANSION TASHA TOOK THE MUMS OUT FOR A PARTICULAR KIND OF RETAIL THERAPY 
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO TODAY IS I WANT YOU TO GO UP TO PEOPLE 
TO ACTUALLY SAY TO PEOPLE CAN I GIVE YOU A HUG 
NO NO NO WAY 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T FEEL AT THE MOMENT THAT YOU CAN DO 
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT AND YOU FEEL YOU CAN'T DO IT 
BUT BY LUNCHTIME TODAY YOU WILL HAVE DONE IT SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL RELAX AND ENJOY IT 
WHO DO YOU THINK I SHOULD GO FOR 
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I CAN DO IT 
WHERE ARE ALL THE FRIENDLY FACES 
PEOPLE TO HUG PEOPLE TO HUG PEOPLE TO HUG 
EXCUSE ME I HAVE TO ASK SOMEONE TO GIVE ME A HUG NO THANK YOU 
I AM GOING TO FAIL 
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS AT ALL 
EXCUSE ME CAN I ASK YOU A BIG FAVOUR 
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK SOMEONE FOR A HUG AND WHETHER I CAN RECEIVE A HUG BACK 
OF COURSE YOU CAN IS THAT 
THANK YOU THAT'S BRILLIANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S REALLY GOOD 
HEY I DONE IT A STRANGER LET ME 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
CAN I HAVE A HUG BACK AS WELL YES 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED HAVE A NICE DAY BYE 
THAT'S ONE 
I DON'T KNOW WHO TO GO FOR I DON'T WANT TO GO FOR ANYONE HERE 
I THINK WITH EVERYONE ONCE YOU HAVE A CHILD YOU LOSE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE YOURSELF 
YOU HAVE TO BUILD UP MORE FRIENDS AND A NEW SOCIAL LIFE AND A NEW SUPPORT SYSTEM 
I THINK UNTIL YOU GET THAT ALL TOGETHER AND SORTED IT CAN BE A VERY WORRYING LONELY TIME 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING 
I DON'T FEEL GOOD IN WHAT WAY 
I FEEL REALLY NERVOUS DO YOU FEEL PHYSICALLY I FEEL REALLY ANXIOUS 
AND JUST A BIT YEAH O. K. O. K. 
CAN WE PICK SOMEBODY TOGETHER DO YOU THINK THERE'S A GENTLEMAN JUST THERE LOOKING AT US 
COME ON IT WON'T BE PAINFUL HONESTLY COME HERE 
I JUST HAVE TO ASK SOMEONE FOR A HUG 
A HUG IS THAT SO BAD 
I'M A BLOODY OLD MAN THAT DOESN'T MATTER 
THERE YOU GO THAT'S LOVELY 
THANK YOU NOT A PROBLEM THANK YOU GOD THERE YOU GO 
HELLO 
BACK AT THE MANSION SABITA HAD A SURPRISE VISITOR 
HER SISTER FIONA 
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH 
I'VE MISSED YOU TOO COME HERE YOU 
IT'S NICE INNIT 
SABITA WAS STILL WORRIED ABOUT THE IDEA OF TAKING HER CLOTHES OFF FOR THE PHOTO SHOOT 
FORTUNATELY HER SISTER WAS ON HAND TO OFFER SOME SENSITIVE ADVICE JUST STAND BEHIND A BUSH 
I AM NOT HAVING PICTURES BEHIND A BUSH I HAVE A BUSH OF MY OWN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THEY WON'T SHOW THAT ON T. V. ANYWAY 
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO SCARE EVERYONE 
I AM ONLY JOKING 
SHE IS NICE ISN'T SHE THAT'S THE REASON I DON'T WANT TO DO IT 
SHE IS LAUGHING AT ME YES YOU ARE YOU HAVE ME OFF NOW OFF 
THE WEIGHT IS THE ISSUE I THINK SHE WOULD LIKE TO BE SLIMMER BECAUSE SHE WAS BEFORE SHE HAD THE CHILDREN 
SHE IS NOT BOTHERED THAT SHE'S BIG 
JUST IF SHE WAS A BIT SLIMMER 
YOU ALWAYS GO ON ABOUT MY SIZE 
NO I NEVER SAY NOTHING ABOUT YOUR SIZE YOU DO ALL THE TIME 
REMEMBER THAT TIME WE HAD AN ARGUMENT AT THE BUS STOP 
SERIOUSLY REMEMBER 
IT'S NOT ME THAT GOES ON ABOUT IT 
IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE VERY INSECURE ABOUT YOUR SIZE NO I'M NOT YOU HAVE BEEN 
TO THE POINT PEOPLE SAY I'M GOING TO DIE BECAUSE I'M OVERWEIGHT 
I'VE NEVER SAID THAT TO YOU YOU'RE SUCH A LIAR 
WITH THE PHOTO SHOOT LOOMING EVEN THE NORMALLY SELF ASSURED SHELLEY WAS HAVING A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE 
I WANTED TO GO ON THIS THING TODAY ABOUT SELF ESTEEM AND CONFIDENCE 
AND ROBYN AND MARIGOLD WERE CHOSEN TO DO IT AND THEY NEED IT AS WELL 
I WAS QUITE HAPPY ABOUT IT BUT THEN ROBYN REFUSED TO DO IT BUT SHE IS NOT AT WORK OR ANYTHING 
SHE HAS JUST STAYED AT HOME I WENT AWAY KNOWING THAT I WANTED TO DO THIS THING AND SHE 
HAS JUST SAT AT HOME AND WENT TO BED FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS IT HAS REALLY GOT TO US A BIT 
I KNOW I AM SO FED UP 
THE EVENTS OF THE DAY HAD RAISED SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT ROBYN'S BEHAVIOUR 
SOME OF THE MUMS PROPOSED DRASTIC ACTION 
THINK OF AN ULTIMATUM LIKE WE WANT TO HELP YOU 
WE WANT TO SUPPORT YOU AND WANT YOU TO BE PART OF THIS GROUP 
TAKING A STEP BACK FROM YOUR DAUGHTER IS THE BEST THING FOR HER 
THE BEST THING FOR YOU AND THE BEST THING FOR THE TWO OF YOU AS A UNIT 
YOU'RE CLEARLY UNHAPPY 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HERE AND BE PART OF THE GROUP 
THE BEST THING FOR US TO DO IS TO LET YOU GO HOME 
KEEN TO SORT OUT THE GROWING PROBLEM 
TASHA CALLED A MEETING TO MAKE ROBYN AWARE OF THE GROUP'S CONCERNS 
ROBYN YEAH 
WE'RE GOING TO BE UP IN THE CHILL OUT ROOM AT NINE O'CLOCK FOR THIS MEETING ALL RIGHT 
KELCI WILL BE UP THEN BECAUSE I HAVE TO FEED HER AT THAT TIME 
ALL RIGHT TRY TO PUT HER DOWN AS NEAR TO NINE AS YOU CAN AND THEN COME UP AND JOIN US ALL RIGHT 
O. K. COOL 
SUCH BLOODY HARD WORK THAT WOMAN IS 
I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE ALL 
LIKE SAID THAT IT'S NOT COS YOU DON'T WANT ME TO BE HERE 
IT'S THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ME UNHAPPY I APPRECIATE THAT I AGREE WITH MOST OF YOU 
I AM MAKING THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT FOR YOUS LOT 
BECAUSE I'M NOT WANTING TO LEAVE KELCI AND EVERYTHING 
SO I DID DECIDE THAT I WANTED TO TRY AND GIVE 
ALL YOUR IDEAS A GO I WANTED TO TRY AND LEAVE KELCI WITH YOUS LOT MORE OFTEN 
DESPITE ROBYN'S CHANGE OF HEART AT THE END OF HER SECOND DAY AS LEADER 
THE DEMANDS OF BEING IN CHARGE HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL ON TASHA 
I HAD REAL ISSUES ABOUT ME BEING A LEADER 
I THOUGHT THE GROUP WAS GOING TO GO DOWNHILL WITH ME BEING A LEADER BECAUSE OF THE WAY PEOPLE PORTRAY ME 
TASHA'S UPBRINGING HAS MADE TASHA A VERY INDEPENDENT PERSON NEEDING 
TO LOOK AFTER HERSELF AND WANTS TO BE LOVED BY OTHERS 
SO ALTHOUGH SHE COMES ACROSS AS VERY STRONG AND INDEPENDENT THERE'S ALSO THE SELF CONSCIOUS SIDE TO HER 
WHICH DOESN'T ALWAYS COME OUT BUT IS ALWAYS THERE 
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DO IT BECAUSE I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO 
HATE MYSELF AS A PERSON 
TASHA DOES PUT UP QUITE A HARD EXTERIOR 
SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO SHOW THAT IT'S GETTING TO HER OR THAT IT'S UPSETTING HER I DON'T KNOW WHY 
SHE LIKES TO PUT ON THIS BIG HARD IMAGE REALLY 
I OBVIOUSLY AM A NICE PERSON AND I OBVIOUSLY AM A CONFIDENT PERSON 
I CAN DO THINGS THAT MAKE PEOPLE FEEL GOOD 
SO I SHOULD FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF 
BUT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THAT'S IN THE BACK OF MY MIND THAT WON'T LET ME DO THAT 
MONDAY MORNING AND THE MANSION EMPTIED OUT AS KIDS WENT TO SCHOOL AND ADULTS TO WORK 
THIS WAS DAY THREE OF TASHA'S VOLUNTARY CLEANING SYSTEM 
BUT SHE'D YET TO HAVE ANY VOLUNTEERS 
UNABLE TO BEAR THE MESS THE LEADER DECIDED TO DO IT ALL HERSELF 
BUT OTHERS LEFT IN THE HOUSE HAD GOT SOMETHING ELSE ON THEIR MINDS 
POSING NAKED FOR A PHOTO 
JOG ON 
ROBYN DON'T HAVE ANY SELF CONFIDENCE AT ALL 
SHE'S ALWAYS ON ABOUT HER WEIGHT 
SHE THINKS SHE IS UGLY BUT SHE AIN'T 
AND SHE'S JUST ALWAYS PUTTING HERSELF DOWN 
SHE'S GOT NO SELF CONFIDENCE WHATSOEVER 
FOR THE MUMS OUT AT WORK THE IDEA OF BARING ALL 
MEANT THEY WERE FINDING IT HARD TO KEEP THEIR MINDS ON THE JOB 
THE WAY I FEEL AT THE MINUTE THERE IS NO WAY NO WAY ON EARTH I'M DOING THAT CALENDAR 
I HIDE THE FACT THAT I DON'T HAVE A PERFECT BODY VERY WELL 
I DON'T THEN WANT TO SHOW THAT TO THE WORLD 
VERY ANTI CALENDAR 
I WOULD BE VERY OFFENDED IF I SAW SOMEBODY WALKING DOWN THE STREET NAKED EXTREMELY OFFENDED 
WHY'S THAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE THEIR BITS AND PIECES 
THE REASON THEY ARE CALLED PRIVATE PARTS IS BECAUSE THEY'RE PRIVATE 
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE CONTROVERSIAL PHOTO SHOOT TASHA CALLED THE CALENDAR GIRLS TOGETHER 
I NEED TO KIND OF ASK 
WHO'S GOING TO DO THE PHOTO SHOOT FULL ON 
FULL OFF YEAH FULL ON OR FULL OFF 
WHICHEVER WAY YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT 
AND WHO DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT 
AND THEN WORK OUT IF YOU GUYS ANYONE WANTS TO PUT THEMSELVES UP TO BE MISS JANUARY MISS APRIL MISS DECEMBER 
MISS OCTOBER 
I WANT OCTOBER CAN I HAVE JUNE PLEASE SABITA 
ARE YOU GOING TO PARTICIPATE TOMORROW NO 
GO ON 
GO ON DO A HEAD SHOT IT CAN'T MAKE YOU FEEL IT'LL BE LUSH 
IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER 
IF YOU MAKE ME DO IT IF I DID IT I WILL JUST 
IT WON'T GIVE ME NO CONFIDENCE I KNOW THAT FOR SURE 
EVEN IF THE PHOTOGRAPH'S BEAUTIFUL WHAT 
COS THEY'RE BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOS WITH MY ROLLS OF FAT HANGING OUT 
THAT'S GOING TO BE BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT 
A LOT OF BIG PEOPLE DO FEEL BEAUTIFUL 
AT H. AND AMP M. BIG IS BEAUTIFUL AND THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL BIB 
I WOULDN'T SAY SHE EASILY GETS STRESSED OUT 
BUT IF SOMETHING UPSETS HER SHE WILL SNAP THAT'S IT 
I THINK THE MORE YOU PUSH SO BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE I'M FAT 
OH OFF THE LOT OF YOU GET A LIFE 
KEEP GOING ON ABOUT THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT THERE TO BE TOLD I'M FAT THAT'S THE REASON WHY I'M NOT DOING IT 
I'M NOT TAKING NO I SAID I WON'T DO IT I HAVE TAKEN PART IN EVERYTHING RIGHT 
I AM NOT TAKING MY CLOTHES OFF THAT'S ONE THING I REFUSE TO DO 
MENTION OF THE PHOTO SHOOT HAD ONCE AGAIN SPLIT THE HOUSE 
AND WITH BAD WEATHER PREDICTED THE OUTLOOK FOR TASHA'S CALENDAR LOOKED BLEAK 
I FEEL LIKE THE GROUP'S KIND OF 
DIVIDED UP AGAIN TONIGHT THERE WAS LOTS OF THINGS THAT WERE SAID AND TAKEN THE WRONG WAY 
AND I THINK IT JUST GOT OUT OF HAND BY THE END OF IT 
AND PEOPLE STARTED GETTING UPSET AND UPTIGHT 
AND IT JUST WENT ALL A LITTLE BIT PEAR SHAPED 
THE FINAL DAY OF TASHA'S LEADERSHIP AND DECISION TIME ABOUT THE NUDE CALENDAR PHOTO SHOOT 
WHAT IS THAT FROG FROG 
I'M GETTING A BIT WORRIED BEING OUT IN THE COLD NAKED ACTUALLY 
I AM WORRIED ABOUT THIS PHOTO SHOOT 
ARE YOU YEAH WHY 
BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF SUNK IN WHAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING TODAY 
THE MUMS MIGHT HAVE BEEN LUKEWARM BUT OUTSIDE IT WAS NEAR FREEZING 
SLIGHT TREPIDATION BECAUSE IT'S RATHER COLD 
AND I THINK RAIN'S EXPECTED AS WELL ISN'T IT 
DESPITE THE WEATHER SOME OF THE MUMS HAVE DECIDED TO BARE ALL 
WHAT'S THE MATTER 
NO YOU CAN'T TOUCH THAT THAT THE LADY'S MAKE UP 
I'M REALLY NERVOUS 
MORE NERVOUS THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD BE 
OH MY GOD BEST TO BE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE 
CAN I GIVE YOU THAT PLEASE 
I'M COMPLETELY NAKED 
AHH 
I LOVE IT COS I LIKE LIVING ON THE EDGE 
KEEP SMILING GREAT GRIN THINK OF SOMETHING REALLY WONDERFUL AND HAPPY 
THANK YOU O. K. PHEW 
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL SHALL WE EACH HAVE THAT UMBRELLA OVER GREAT 
DESPITE EARLIER CONCERNS SOMEONE ELSE HAD ALSO DECIDED TO BRAVE THE COLD 
IT'S HORRIBLE 
KEEP THAT SMILE ON YOUR FACE 
THE CHICKEN'S COMING TO PECK ME THE CHICKEN'S FINE 
THE CHICKEN ADDS TO THE PICTURE 
YEAH I'M GLAD I'VE DONE IT JUST COS I SHOULDN'T BE ASHAMED OF MY BODY NO MATTER HOW IT IS 
WITH THE SHOOT GATHERING MOMENTUM BACK IN THE MANSION THERE WERE FURTHER REVELATIONS 
JUST HEARD SABITA'S GOING TO MAYBE DO THE CALENDAR 
WHICH I THINK'S EXCELLENT SHE'LL SEE THAT SHE IS ACTUALLY BEAUTIFUL 
I REALLY FEEL SICK 
I THINK YOU'RE VERY BRAVE COS I KNOW YOU WERE FEELING I THINK I'M MAD 
DON'T LOOK ANYONE THAT DOESN'T NEED TO 
OH MY GOD I CAN'T DON'T BE ASHAMED OF YOUR BODY 
BE PROUD OF YOUR BODY I'M SCARED 
DID YOU THINK YOU COULD DO THIS 
NOT IN A MILLION YEARS 
O. K. DONE 
I'M WELL HAPPY THAT I DID IT 
GOOD BUT 
I'M GOING TO PHONE MY SISTER IN A MINUTE AND TELL HER I DONE IT 
THANKS SABITA FINALLY IT WAS THE THE LEADER'S TURN 
BUT WOULD THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THE PHOTO SHOOT COPE WITH ITS DEMANDS 
BUT SHE WOULD BE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO DO IT 
LOOK THEY'RE DOWN THERE STARING 
CAN WE JUST TAKE THE SHOTS 
HANG ON I'M STOOD OUT HERE NAKED 
THERE'S A HOUSE OVER THERE I'VE GOT PEOPLE STOOD IN THE OFFICE LOOKING 
TASHA CAN BE ARGUMENTATIVE 
I'M NOT GONNA TO DO IT YOU'VE GOT A SHOT AND THAT'S IT 
TASHA IS NOT GENERALLY ONE FOR STROPPING OFF 
SHE'S ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT WILL STAND THERE AND FIGHT HER CORNER 
SHE WON'T JUST WALK AWAY 
BUT THIS TIME TASHA WAS READY TO WALK AWAY 
FROM THE WEATHER THE PHOTO SHOOT AND THE MANSION 
ARE YOU DEFINITELY LEAVING RIGHT NOW 
YES I'M GOING DOES NOT ANYONE UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M GOING MEANS 
I THOUGHT SHE'D CRACK UNDER PRESSURE AND SHE'S CRACKED UNDER PRESSURE 
I DIDN'T THINK SHE'D CRACK TO WANT TO GO HOME 
I THOUGHT SHE'D SAY I CAN'T DO THIS NO MORE 
AND STOMP TO HER ROOM AND HAVE A TANTRUM 
AS TASHA PACKED HER BAGS SHE WAS UNAWARE THAT DOWNSTAIRS A SUCCESS STORY WAS UNFOLDING 
ROBYN WAS FINALLY TAKING PART IN A GROUP ACTIVITY 
THAT'S IT GREAT DONE THANK YOU 
AN HOUR LATER TASHA HAD A CHANGE OF HEART 
THE LAST FOUR DAYS HAS TURNED ME INTO AN EMOTIONAL WRECK 
BUT MAYBE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS' TIME WHEN I'VE HAD SOME SLEEP 
MANAGED TO CALM DOWN AND GET BACK INTO THE ROUTINE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN THEN I'LL FEEL DIFFERENTLY 
HOPEFULLY I'LL FEEL HAPPIER ABOUT IT 
AT THE END OF TASHA'S LEADERSHIP THE MUMS GATHERED TOGETHER TO SEE HOW THE PHOTO SHOOT TURNED OUT 
I DON'T FEEL I'VE BEEN INVOLVED AT ALL SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY HOW SHE'S DONE AS LEADER 
THE HOUSE IS A MESS 
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN NO STRUCTURE 
NOBODY'S BEEN MADE TO DO ANYTHING 
CERTAIN THINGS HAVEN'T WORKED 
A LOT OF THE MUMS ARE DISGUSTED WITH THE HOUSE I MEAN SHE'S TRIED YESTERDAY SHE WAS DOING EVERYTHING 
BUT SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO GO ROUND AND CLEAN HOOVER WASH UP DO THIS AND DO THAT 
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELEGATED TO EVERYBODY ELSE TO DO 
I THINK THAT SHE'S HAD A REALLY TOUGH TASK 
GETTING PEOPLE TO DO THINGS THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IS REALLY TOUGH 
THE HOUSE MAY HAVE BEEN A MESS 
BUT THERE WERE SIGNS THAT TASHA'S QUEST TO BOOST THE MUMS' SELF CONFIDENCE HAD PAID OFF 
LOOK AT ROBYN IT LOOKS GOOD LOOK AT YOU 
LOOK AT THAT 
SUITS YOU THAT LOOKS LOVELY 
THAT DOES REALLY SUIT YOU 
MY BUM IS HUGE 
LOOK AT THAT OH MY GOD OH MY GOD 
I AM ACTUALLY REALLY BUZZING NOW 
BECAUSE I'VE HAD THIS COMPLETE DREAD 
AND THEN OH IT'S NOT ACTUALLY AS BAD AS I THOUGHT 
WHOO THAT'S BEAUTIFUL 
THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL SABITA LOOK AT IT 
I'VE LEARNED THAT I CAN DO THINGS I SHOULD GIVE THINGS A GO BEFORE I SAY NO 
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ACHIEVED SOMETHING 
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ENJOYED MY LEADERSHIP 
I AM GLAD IT'S NOW OVER AND I CAN ACTUALLY RELAX AND ENJOY 
MY TIME IN THE HOUSE AGAIN RATHER THAN IT ALL BEING TOTAL PRESSURE 
LATER TONIGHT A NEW LEADER TAKES OVER 
AND NATASHA CLAXTON HAS A WHOLE NEW SET OF CHALLENGES FOR THE MUMS 
MY THEME FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS IS DATING I WANT MONEY SPENT ON ME 
NO I'M BEING SERIOUS 
BECAUSE I AM ALWAYS THE SPENDER 
BUT HOW CAN THEY FIND THE CONFIDENCE THEY NEED WHEN THEIR LAST RELATIONSHIP FELL APART 
IT'S LIKE I'VE FAILED 
HE SAID TO ME YOU HAVE GOT ALL THE CURVES AND THE PACKAGES 
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO SEE SOME OF IT ALL 
AND I'VE GOT SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S JUST MENTAL 
AND THEY'RE SAYING I'M ON A DIFFERENT PLANET 
AND THERE'S A SURPRISE NEWCOMER TO THE HOUSE 
HE'S NOT BAD LOOKING 
SO HOW WILL THE MUMS REACT TO HAVING MEN AROUND ONCE MORE
