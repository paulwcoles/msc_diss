HE SAID 
AND TO 
THE M. D. C. THEY 
PAID AGENTS

WE NEED TO MAINTAIN 
UTMOST VIGILANCE IN THE FACE OF 
VICIOUS BRITISH IMAGINATIONS 
WHEREAS YESTERDAY THEY RELIED ON 
BRUTE FORCE TO SUBJUGATE OUR PEOPLE 
AND PLUNDER OUR RESOURCES TODAY 
THEY HAVE PERFECTED THEIR TACTICS 
TO MORE SUBTLE FORMS AS THEY 
THREW MONEY AS A WEAPON LITERALLY 
BY SOME OF OUR PEOPLE TO TURN 
AGAINST THEIR GOVERNMENT 
THERE WAS 
NO MENTION OF THE DISPUTED ELECTION 
NO 
MENTION OF 
Y. THREE WEEKS ON THE 
RESULT HAS 
IS THE 
SAD COLLAPSE 
OF A 
HOPE MUGABE 
HIMSELF 
BEEN 
JAILED BY THE 
BRITISH AND ON 
HAD 
GONE TO 
THE BUSH TO 
FIGHT THE 
LIBERATION WAR 
WHEN 
FIGHT THE LIBERATION WAR WHEN IT WAS 
REACHED OUT TO INCLUDE 
FORMER ENEMIES AND 
IN THE NEW NATION IT WAS INSPIRING 
AND ADMIRED EVERYWHERE THERE CAN 
NEVER BE ANY RETURN TO 
THE STATE OF 
NEVER BE ANY RETURN TO THE STATE OF ARMED CONFLICT OUR 
COMMITMENT TO PEACE 
AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS OF ELECTION UNDER 
THE LIKE 
US TO HOUSE 
AGREEMENT SURELY THIS IS 
TO BEAT OUR SWORDS INTO 
PLOUGHSHARES 
WHEN MANY ZIMBABWEANS ARE GOING 
HUNGRY FOR WANT THE FOOD THIS 
CARGO IS SAID TO INCLUDE THREE 
MILLION KALASHNIKOV ROUNDS ROCKET 
PROPELLED GRENADES AND MORTAR 
LAUNCHERS THE M. D. C. WILL SEE THE 
SHIPMENT AS CONSISTENT WITH MR. 
MUGABE'S CHOSEN METHOD OF STAY 
ANYTHING POWER THEY ACCUSE HIM OF 
MILL TARRISING THE BATTLE AND ARE 
PLNG TO WAGE WAR ON THE ZIMBABWEAN 
PEOPLE MORGAN TSVANGIRAI SAYS 
THERE'S NO CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER 
WHICH HE WILL CONTEST A SECOND 
ROUND RUN OFF THAT MEANS MR. MUGABE 
WILL STAY IN POWER BUT BE DENIED 
THE ELECTION VICTORY HE WANTS 
HERE IN THE STUDIO IS JOEL KIBAZO 
WHO IS NAM WITH THE WORKING OF 
AFRICAN DIPLOMACY AFTER YEARS AS 
SPOKESMAN AT LONDON SECRETARIAT 
THE SILENCE FROM AFRICAN LEADERS IS 
DEVONING ARE THEY GOING TO GRASP 
THE NETTLE AND DO SOMETHING I I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO ANYBODY 
WHO THOUGHT THAT LAST WEEK'S 
MEETING IN OSAKA WOULD YIELD 
POSITIVE RESULTS MUST HAVE BEEN 
THINKING OUT OF THE BOX BECAUSE 
AFRICAN LEADERS WILL NEVER EVER 
JUST COME AND SAY RIGHT MUGABE IT 
IS TIME TO GO THAT'S NOT HOW IT 
WORKS THERE WILL BE GENTLE 
PERSUASION LET'S NOT FORGET THAT 
SADEC IS NOT AT ONE ON THIS ONE 
QUITE A FEW COUNTRIES ARE FEELING 
IT IS TIME FOR HIM TO GO BUT 
NOBODY WILL STEP UP AND SAY IT IS 
NOW TIME THE OTHER POINT IS THAT 
OF COURSE THAT'S NOT HELPED WHEN 
YOU GET WESTERN LEADERS LIKE GORDON 
BROWN SAYING IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO 
GO BECAUSE WHAT THAT DOES IT SORT 
OF BUILDS SOME KIND OF SUPPORT AND 
MOMENTUM FOR ROBERT MUGABE TO STAY 
IN POWER 
DO MEMBERS OF THE 
SOUTHERNPSAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT 
COMMUNITY DO THEY REALLY BUY ALL 
THAT ANTI CLONIAN RHETORIC THEY 
GET FROM MUGABE TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AFTER 
ZIMBABWE BECAME INDEPENDENT THEY THEY DON'T BUY IT AS MANY PEOPLE 
REALISE AFRICA IS A DIFFERENT 
AFRICA TO THAT OF THIRTY YEARS AGO 
THINGS HAVE MOVED ON HOWEVER THIS 
IS A LIBERATION STRUGGLE HERO THE 
RESPECT OF THAT CONTINUES AMONGST 
MANY OF THEM AND NOBODY WANTS TO BE 
THE PERSON TO ACTUALLY PUSH AND SAY 
RIGHT THIS IS TIME TO GO 
YOU SEE 
THABO MBEKI HOLDING HANDS WITH 
ROBERT MUGABE ON SATURDAY I MEAN 
WHEN DO YOU THINK WE MIGHT SEE THE 
AFRICAN UNION FOR INSTANCE STEP 
IN AND SAY RIGHT AS MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI HAS SAID HE WANTS OTHERS 
TO MEDIATE RATHER THAN SOUTH AFRICA 
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THE 
AFRICAN UNION TO STEP IN THERE 
ISN'T A BODY REASON THE AFRICAN 
UNION THERE ISN'T A COUNCIL THAT 
WOULD SIT AND DELIBERATE IN THAT 
WAY AFRICAN UNION WILL MEET AS A 
BODY ALL FIFTY THREE COUNTRIES AND IN THAT 
KIND OF SETTING PEOPLE FORGET HOW 
STRONG ZIMBABWEAN DIPLOMACY IS IT 
IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
YOU KNOW 
WHAT THE JUTE SIDE WORLD WILL SAY 
WE LOOK TO YOU AFRICANS TO SOLVE 
YOUR OWN PROBLEMS AND YOU FAILED 
THE TEST THE AFRICANS IN ZIMBABWE 
ARE NOT BEING ALLOWED TO LIVE BY 
THE RULE OF LAW OR DEMOCRACY 
THEY'LL SAY WE'RE DOING IT IN OUR 
OWN WAY SLOWLY STEP BY STEP HAVE 
NO FEAR THE FACT THAT A SADEC 
SUBMIT WAS CALLED IS AN INDICATION 
THAT THEY'RE GETTING TO THE END OF 
THEIR TETHER WE WILL SEE A CHANGE 
IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW THE RICHEST CRICKET TOURNAMENT 
IN THE WORLD BEGAN TODAY USHERING 
IN A NEW ERA OF BIG MONEY FOR THE 
GAME THE INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE HAS 
AMERICAN STYLE CHEERLEADERS SOME 
OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN THE GAME 
AND A LOT OF MONEY BACKING IT 
EIGHT TEAMS ARE COMPETING ALL 
TRYING TO MAKE IT TO THE FINAL IN 
MUMBAI IN JUNE COULD THIS 
COMPETITION THREATEN TO LEAD 
CRICKET AWAY FROM MORE TRADITIONAL 
FORMS OF THE GAME 
CRICKET HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING 
LIKE IT THE NEW INDIAN PREMIER 
LEAGUE COMPETITION THE PURISTS MAY 
SHUDDER THE GAME IS CHANGING JUST 
THE BROADCASTING RIGHTS FOR THE I. P. L. 
HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR ONE BILLION DOLLARS U. S. 
DOLLARS IT'S MODELLED ON ENGLISH 
PREMIERSHIP FOOTBALL CASH RICH 
TEAMS BUYING IN THE BEST TALENT 
FROM AROUND THE WORLD THE HIGHEST 
SALARIES TOP ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND A WEEK NO 
WONDER PLAYERS ARE SMILING 
I FEEL 
I PROBABLY DESERVED A LOT MORE BUT 
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT BAD AT THE END OF 
THE DAY 
IS IT RIGHT THAT CRICKET 
IS BEING REWARDED LIKE FOOTBALLERS 
LIKE OTHER PROFESSIONAL SPORTS I I THINK SO YOU JUST HAVE TO LOCK AT 
WHAT THE T. V. RIGHTS GOT SOLD HERE 
FOR OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS THE MONEY IN 
CRICKET IN INDIA IS PHENOMENAL THE 
PLAYERS SHOULD SHARE IN IT ENGLISH ENGLISH STARS WON'T BE SETTING FOOT ON THE 
GRASS THEY WERE MOWING PAINTING 
AND POLISHING IN BANGALORE TODAY 
THE ENGLISH BOARD WON'T RELEASE 
THEM BUT THAT MAY HAVE TO CHANGE 
THE INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE IS ABOUT 
MORE THAN WHAT HAPPENS HERE ON THIS 
PITCH SUCH VAST SUMS HAVE BEEN 
PUMPED INTO IT THE QUESTION IS 
CAN CRICKET DELIVER THE WOW FACTOR 
THE PROFITS SOME OF INDIA'S 
BIGGEST BUSINESSMEN THINK SO 
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE BACKING IT 
VIJAY MALLYA LIKES TO CALL HIMSELF 
THE KING OF INDIA'S GOOD TIMES THE 
TYCOON HAS SPENT OVER FIFTY MILLION 
ASEMBLING HIS ROYAL CHALLENGERS 
TEAM AUSTRALIAN CARIBBEAN AND 
SOUTH AFRICAN PLAYERS HAVE ALL 
SIGNED FOR HIM THIS IS WHERE HE'S 
MADE BILLIONS INDIA'S BOOMING 
AIRLINE BUSINESS HE OWNS THE 
BIGGEST AND IN BOOZE HE'S INDIA'S 
LIQUOR BARON HIS BREWING EMPIRE IS 
GOING GLOBAL AS ARE HIS AMBITIONS 
FOR CRICKET 
IF YOU ASKED ME A 
QUESTION OF WHETHER I'D LIKE TO 
HAVE A FEW ENGLISHMEN IN MY TEAM 
MY ANSWER IS YES IF YOU ASK ME 
WHETHER I'M ABLE TO ACQUIRE ANY OF 
THEM THE ANSWER IS I DON'T KNOW 
SO TONIGHT THE KNIGHT RIDERS VERSUS 
THE ROYAL CHALLENGERS COULD BE THE 
START OF A REVOLUTION CRICKET'S 
TRADITION SUPPLANTED BY INDIA'S 
BRASH NEW UPSTART 
THE SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH 
OF ISRAEL IS F. S. T. APPROACHING FOR 
JEWS IT'S A TIME OF CELEBRATION 
BUT FOR PALESTINIANS NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT IS KNOWN 
AS THE CATASTROPHE HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS WERE 
FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES TO MAKE 
WAY FOR THE NEW STATE SOME WENT TO 
THE WEST BANK AND GAZA OTHERS LEFT 
ENTIRELY SEVERAL MILLION 
PALESTINIAN REFUGEES ARE NOW 
SCATTERED AROUND THE WORLD A NEW 
EXHIBITION CALLED HOMELAND LOST HAS 
JUST OPENED IN LONDON AND USES THE 
CAMERA LENS TO REFLECT ON WHAT 
HAPPENED 
FACES AND PLACES AND THE DISTANCE 
WHICH NOW LIES IT BETWEEN MEMORIES 
IN THE EYES OF THE OLD THE LAND 
NOW TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING NEW 
THE LEGACY OF LOSS HANDED DOWN FROM 
ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT 
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GREAT WAY 
TO SHOW WHAT IS THE FOUNDATION 
WHAT IS THE BASIS OF THE CONFLICT 
OF COURSE IT IS THE RIGHT OF RETURN 
IT'S TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE FALL 
ANYONE LOVE WITH THE SAME PIECE OF 
LAND THERE'S A LOT OF PALESTINIANS 
WHO ARE LIVE ING WHO FEEL THAT THEY 
MITE NOT WANT TO LIVE IN ISRAEL OR 
LIVE IN PALESTINE BUT THEY WANT TO 
BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO VISIT FAMILY 
FRIENDS THIS IS ADDING SO MUCH TO 
THE BITTERNESS TO THE ANGER OF 
NOT HAVING THAT RIGHT 
IT'S NOT 
JUST ABOUT THE IMAGES IT'S ABOUT 
THE STORIES BEHIND THOSE IMAGES 
TELL ME ABOUT THOSE 
THERE'S A LADY 
SILVIA WHO LIVES IN BEIRUT WE 
WANTED TO PHOTOGRAPH THEM WITH 
SOMETHING FROM THEIR PREVIOUS LIVES 
IN PALESTINE SHE SAID WELL YES I 
HAVE THE HOUSE KEY SHE SAID I 
LIVED BY THE BARRACKS WHICH IS 
WHERE THE BRITISH BARRACKS USED TO 
BE SHE SAID IT'S THE BETHLEHEM 
ROAD AND THAT STILL EXISTS SOY 
TOOK ABOUT FOUR PICTURES OF 
DIFFERENT HOUSES I E. MAILED THEM 
AND SHE SAID MY GOD THIS IS MY 
HOUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN SIXTY 
YEARS I ASKED IF SHE WAS SURE AND 
SHE WAS SHE REMEMBERED THE DOOR 
VIVIDLY HOUSE HAD NOT CHANGED ONE 
AYE OATA SINCE NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT THIS IS A LONG 
DISTANCE RUNNER SHE TRAINS ON THE 
BEACH IN GAZA I WANTED TO BRING 
THE CONCEPT OF BEING A REFUGEE TO 
THE GENERATION TOUCHING ON TODAY I 
WANTED TO PHOTOGRAPH HER ON THE 
BEACH BECAUSE THE BEACH IS A BIG 
PART OF HER LIFE THEN WENT BACK TO 
WHERE SHE ORIGINALLY CAME FROM 
TODAY NOTHING IS LEFT OF THE 
VILLAGE A MOSHAB HAS BEEN BUILT ON 
TOP OF IT IT'S A BIG AGRICULTURAL 
AREA 
WHEN YOU WERE ABLE TO SHOW AREA SOME OF THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE 
LAND AND THE PROPERTY THAT PEOPLE 
HAD LOST TO THOSE PEOPLE YOU MUST 
HAVE GOT SOME EMOTIONAL RESPONSES 
VERY EMOTIONAL RESPONSES I THINK 
ALSO THERE'S A LOT OF RECOGNITION 
PEOPLE TEND TO THINK WELL WE'RE IN 
THE GOING BACK BUT THERE'S A 
FEELING THAT ONE THEY WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE WHERE THEY WERE BORN OR 
WHERE THEY GREW UP IT'S VERY MUCH 
THAT PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY NEED TO 
BELONG SOMEWHERE BELONG TO 
SOMETHING 
THE DESIRE FOR A PLACE SOMETHING TO CALL HOME AND COMPETING CLAIMS 
OVER A PIECE OF LAND IMAGES WHICH 
GO RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THE MIDDLE 
EAST DILEMMA 
OUR TOP HEADLINES POPE BENEDICT 
HAS MADE A STRONG APPEAL TO THE UN 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY TORE COUNTRIES TO 
WORK TOGETHER TO DEFEND HUMAN 
RIGHTS AND RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW 
THE POPE SAID ALL UN MEMBERS HAD A 
DUTY TO PROTECT THEIR PEOPLE FROM 
SUSTAINED HUMAN RIEGS VIOLATIONS 
ROBERT MUGABE HAS DENOUNCED THE 
OPPOSITION AND BRITAIN IN A SPEECH 
MARKING ZIMBABWE'S INDEPENDENCE HE

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TO A CROWD OF

COME FURTHER SOUTH THEN WE'RE BACK 
INTO THE CLOUD THEN WE SEE THE 
PATCHY RAIN FOR THE MIDLANDS PARTS 
OF SOUTH EAST ENGLAND PATCHY BUT 
WITH A KEEN BREEZE IT WILL BE A 
COLD RAW DAY THAT EXTENDS ALL THE 
WAY TO SOUTH WEST PARTS OF ENGLAND 
THERE COULD BE THE HEAVIER BURST 
BUT STARTING TO BE PATCHY HERE INTO 
PARTS OF WALES THAT MAIN BAND OF 
RAIN WORKING IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
STAYING DRY BRIGHTER SKIES HERE 
MANAGING A TEN FOR BELFAST INTO THE 
AFTERNOON OUR LOW CONTINUES TO 
SPIRAL ROUND THE FIRST BAND OF 
RAIN EASE AS WAY THE NEXT WORKS IN 
FOR SUNDAY WE'RE STILL INTO THE 
EASTERLY FLOW HIGH PRESSURE 
SITTING TO THE NORTH THE FURTHER 
NORTH YOU ARE DRIER AND BRIGHTER 
FOR SUNDAY HERE'S THE RAIN WORKING 
INTO THE SOUTH MAYBE MILDER AIR
