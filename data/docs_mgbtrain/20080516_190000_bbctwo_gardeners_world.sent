SO MUCH ABOUT THE PROCESS OF GARDENING REMAINS THE SAME 
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE WAY WE GARDEN IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING 
WE'VE GOT LESS TIME LESS SPACE 
WE WANT TO GROW OUR OWN FOOD 
WE WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE PROVENANCE OF PLANTS 
FIND OUT JUST HOW TO GROW THEM 
BUT I SUPPOSE THE MOST EXCITING THING IS RESPONDING 
TO THE CHALLENGES THAT MODERN DAY GARDENING PRESENTS 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO GARDENER'S WORLD 
HERE IN MONTY'S SHADE GARDEN 
THERE WAS A LITTLE MORE SHADE THAN WAS INTENDED 
COS THIS VAST DRIFT OF COW PARSLEY MUCH OF WHICH I'VEJUST TAKEN OUT 
WAS REALLY OBSCURING SOME OF THESE OTHER PLANTS 
IT'S A WONDERFUL PLANT JUST LOOK AT THESE ROOTS 
SMELL OF CARROTS AND YOU CAN TELL IT BELONGS TO THE APIACEAE FAMILY 
TO THE CARROT FAMILY 
BUT I WANT TO REPLACE IT WITH THIS GORGEOUS PLANT 
THIS IS ANOTHER UMBEL ANOTHER MEMBER OF APIACEAE 
IT'S CALLED CHAEROPHYLLUM HIRSUTUM ROSEUM 
IT HAS THESE LOVELY SORT OF SETAL STEMS THAT CREEP ALONG THE GROUND 
AND THEN UP THEY COME WITH THESE GLORIOUS HEADS OF PALE PINK FLOWERS 
AND IT LOOKS VERY SIMILAR TO THE COW PARSLEY IN SOME WAYS 
BUT IT WON'T HAVE SUCH BAD MANNERS 
IT'S A MUCH MORE REFINED KIND OF A PLANT 
AND THREE OF THOSE ARE GOING TO GO IN HERE 
AND THEY'LL BE REALLY HAPPY IN THIS SORT OF SEMI WOODLAND SETTING 
THIS SOIL IS BEAUTIFUL 
IT'S HUMUSSY WITHOUT BEING OVER RICH 
AND THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO ENJOY IT IN THERE 
BUT OVER HERE I WANT TO PLANT SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY REFINED 
SOMETHING EXTRA SPECIAL 
SO THERE'S THIS LOVELY BIG SPACE HERE AND IT'S JUST CRYING OUT 
FOR SOMETHING INCREDIBLY REFINED 
AND I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT PLANT 
THIS IS PODOPHYLLUM VERSIPELLE 
AND THIS ONE AND YOU CAN SEE WHY STRAIGHT AWAY 
IS CALLED SPOTTY DOTTY 
AND IT'S A GLORIOUS GENUS OF PLANT 
THEY COME UP FIRST THING IN THE SPRING WITH THESE LOVELY UMBRELLAS 
TIGHTLY FOLDED PUSHING THROUGH THE SOIL 
AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE 
THEY'VE SENT UP THESE BIG STEMS WITH THESE GLORIOUS BIG LEAVES 
LATER ON THIS WILL HAVE SORT OF CRIMSON CLARETY FLOWERS 
HANGING IN PENDULOUS CLUSTERS FROM JUST UNDER THE LEAVES 
AND THEY'LL BE FOLLOWED BY GREEN FRUIT WHICH TURNS YELLOW 
THIS IS AN ASIATIC PLANT 
AND IT'S ONLY VERY VERY RECENTLY INTRODUCED 
BUT THESE ARE THE IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR GROWING IT 
AND IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE THESE BRILLIANT NEW PLANTS ISN'T IT 
ALL PART OF THE CHANGING WAY WE GARDEN 
ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
JOE'S HERE AT BERRYFIELDS TAKING ON THE CHALLENGE THAT MANY PEOPLE FACE 
CREATING A GARDEN IN A TINY SPACE 
WE'LL BE VISITING A PROJECT IN LONDON 
WHERE THEY'VE COME UP WITH A TOTALLY RADICAL IDEA 
TO GET PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY OUTSIDE SPACE OF THEIR OWN INTO GARDENING 
ALYS IS PLANTING MELONS INTO THE BERRYFIELDS' ALL NEW MELON BED 
AND OF COURSE CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW STARTS NEXT WEEK 
WE'RE FOLLOWING RACHEL DE THAME 
AS SHE GETS READY TO MAKE HER FIRST SHOW GARDEN 
WELL IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK AT BERRYFIELDS I HAVE TO SAY 
AND IT'S LOOKING ABSOLUTELY STUNNING AT THE MOMENT IT'S GORGEOUS 
BUT IT'S A BIG GARDEN IT'S ABOUT TWO ACRES IN TOTAL 
AND AS CAROL SAID THE WAY WE'RE GARDENING IS REALLY CHANGING 
AND ONE OF THE FACTORS IS SPACE SPACE IS BECOMING LIMITED 
FEW PEOPLE HAVE TWO ACRES OF GARDEN 
MOST PEOPLE HAVE MUCH SMALLER GARDENS 
SO HERE AT BERRYFIELDS WE THOUGHT WE'D REFLECT THAT 
AND CREATE A TINY LITTLE GARDEN 
IN FACT THE SMALLEST GARDEN EVER CREATED AT BERRYFIELDS 
UM IT'S REALLY A PATHWAY BETWEEN THE TRIAL BEDS 
AND THE COTTAGE GARDEN 
IT'S GOT THIS GRAVEL SURFACE HERE 
IT'S GOT THE REMNANTS OF A LONICERA HEDGE 
THAT'S BEEN CUT BACK HERE 
NOW THIS SPACE IS SMALL 
IN TOTAL IT'S ABOUT FORTY ONE METRES IN LENGTH 
AND TWENTY FIVE METRES WIDE 
SO IT IS PRETTY SMALL 
AND THE MOST COMMON MISTAKE IN A SMALL SPACE 
IS TO PUT SMALL THINGS IN I'M GONNA SHOW YOU O. K. 
A SMALL POT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK 
O. K. SMALL GARDEN LET'S PUT A SMALL POT IN 
BUT WHAT DOES THAT DO I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING HERE AROUND EYE LEVEL 
I HAVE TO LOOK DOWN I'VE GOT A TINY LITTLE POT 
I CAN ONLY GROW SMALL PLANTS IN THAT 
AND IT CONSTANTLY NEEDS WATERING AS WELL 
AS IT DRIES OUT VERY QUICKLY 
SO YOU GO UP A SIZE TO THE NEXT SIZE POT 
WELL YOU START GETTING A BIT MORE IMPACT IN A SMALL SPACE 
IT STARTS TO ACTUALLY HAVE AN EFFECT 
BUT IF YOU GO UP TO THIS SORT OF SIZE 
AND EVEN LARGER POSSIBLY 
YOU REALLY START MAKING A BIG DIFFERENCE 
IT CREATES INSTANT IMPACT 
AND ALSO MEANS YOU CAN GET SOME LARGER PLANTS IN AS WELL 
SOMETHING UP NEARER EYE LEVEL 
NOW I USED THE WORD INSTANT THERE 
BUT THIS IS NOT GONNA BE AN INSTANT GARDEN 
IT'S GONNA BE A REAL GARDEN THAT DEVELOPS OVER TIME 
AND WHERE THE PLANTING IS CHANGED SEASONALLY AS WELL 
NOT JUST A COUPLE OF PALMS WHERE IT'S JUST STATIC 
BUT IT'S GONNA EXPLORE WHAT YOU CAN DO IN THE SMALLEST OF SPACES 
AND LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME I'M GONNA START THE PLANTING OFF 
NOW LAST YEAR WE VISITED A GROUP OF RESIDENTS IN HOXTON IN LONDON 
QUITE NEAR WHERE I LIVE 
WHO'VE COME UP WITH THE MOST INGENIOUS WAY OF GARDENING 
WITHOUT A GARDEN 
OUR BACKGROUND IS WE BOTH STUDIED ARCHITECTURE 
WE TRAINED IN ARCHITECTURE 
BUT WE'VE HAD AN INTEREST 
IN HOW YOU MIGHT TRANSFORM VERY SMALL SCALE URBAN SPACES 
INVOLVING LOCAL RESIDENTS 
COS THIS REALLY SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY WAY FOR SPACES TO BE LOOKED AFTER 
SO PROVIDING A SENSE OF OWNERSHIP 
WHEN WE FOUND A SPACE THAT WAS OVERGROWN WITH BUDDLEIA 
WHICH WAS THEN REMOVED DURING THE WINTER 
SO WHEN WE STARTED WE HAD A CONCRETE SURFACE WITH MOSS ON IT 
THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS CONSTRUCT THIS WATER TOWER 
WHICH HAS A BIG WATER BUTT ON THE TOP 
WE ORDERED WELL YEAH A LORRY LOAD OF SOIL 
AND WE ORDERED THE BAGS AND FILLED THEM BY HAND WITH WHEELBARROWS 
THE LOCAL RESIDENTS ALSO GOT INVOLVED WITH MAKING IT TOO 
WHEN WE FIRST GOT THE SOIL IT WAS JUST ORDINARY BUILDER'S SOIL 
TOPSOIL WHAT THEY'VE GOT FROM BUILDINGS 
AND WHAT WE DONE WE HAD TO PUT SOME COMPOST IN IT 
AND EVERY NIGHT I WAS COMING DOWN AND TURNING IT OVER 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE RAIN CAME IT HELPED 
AND AFTER A FORTNIGHT WE STARTED PUTTING OUR SEEDLINGS IN 
BUT KNOWING NOTHING ABOUT GARDENING I PUT THEM ALL TOO CLOSE 
AND A LOT OF ME LETTUCES GOT RUINED 
THEY DID IT WAS A SHAME 
BROKE MY BROKE MY HEART WHEN I WENT OUT 
BUT WHEN I GOT MY FIRST CUCUMBER OH BEAUTIFUL 
THE IDEA OF THE BAGS WAS WE WERE DEALING WITH HARD LANDSCAPE HERE 
SO WE WERE LOOKING AT A SIMPLE CONTAINER 
THAT YOU COULD MULTIPLY TO PROVIDE A BIG AREA OF PLANTING 
THE BAGS CAN TAKE ABOUT HALF A TONNE OF SOIL 
SO EACH BAG PROVIDES ENOUGH GROWING SPACE FOR ONE HOUSEHOLD 
COS OF THE NATURE OF THE BAGS 
THEY'RE WEAVED PLASTIC AND THEY ALLOW A LOT OF DRAINAGE THROUGH IT 
SO IT PROVIDES A GOOD SORT OF BASE FOR DOING PLANTING 
BECAUSE WE GOT THEM DESIGNED THEY'RE A BIT LOWER SIXTY C. M. S. HIGH 
AND USUALLY THEY'RE NINETY C. M. S. HIGH 
SO THIS IS JUST ENOUGH SOIL FOR VEGETABLES 
AND SMALL SCALE PLANTS TO GROW IN 
AND I THINK THEY WERE ABOUT SIX POINT NINE NINE EACH BAG 
IT'S GREAT BECAUSE WE LIVE IN FLATS 
WE DON'T HAVE ANY SORT OF PLACES WHERE WE CAN GROW 
WE'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED WINDOW BOXES WHICH WE DID ENQUIRE ABOUT 
THIS BELONGS TO ME 
IT'S MY LITTLE PATCH 
AND I CAN DO WHAT I LIKE WITH IT 
WITH THE PERMISSION OF MY FIVE YEAR OLD 
AND JUST SOMEWHERE FOR YOUR HERBS I'VE GOT SOME FRESH MINT 
WHICH I'M HOPING IS GOING TO SORT OF YOU KNOW SPREAD 
I WANT TO HAVE HALF OF IT MINT SO THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN TEA 
I FEEL I'M GETTING THE GREEN FINGER NOW 
MY MUM DID GROW UP ON AN ACTUAL FARM 
SO I'VE SEEN THEM DO A LOT OF GARDENING 
BUT I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE 
I'VE NEVER GROWN ANYTHING IN MY LIFE NEVER HAD A GARDEN 
NOT EVEN A BALCONY 
SINCE I'VE ALWAYS LIVED IN CENTRAL LONDON 
SO IT'S COMPLETELY NEW FOR ME 
I THINK WE'RE GONNA KEEP GARDENING AS LONG AS WE CAN 
AND YEAH I'D LOVE TO KEEP THE BAGS 
AS LONG AS THEY'RE GONNA DO THIS PROJECT 
IF THEY'RE DOING IT NEXT YEAR IT'D BE GREAT 
WE HOPE TO IN THE FUTURE SET UP SOME SORT OF ORGANISATION 
WITH THE RESIDENTS AND BAG HOLDERS HERE 
THAT MAYBE WE HAVE SOME SORT OF ALLOTMENT SOCIETY OR SOMETHING 
THAT REALLY ESTABLISHES IT AS SOMETHING THAT COULD STAY HERE 
FOR MUCH LONGER AND TO EXPAND IT MAYBE 
AND TO EXPAND IT YEAH 
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN QUITE A FEW PEOPLE INTERESTED IN HAVING BAGS 
BUT OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE AT THE MOMENT 
SO SINCE THERE'S A LOT OF UNUSED SPACES IN THE AREA 
THEY'RE ALL VACANT SO WE MIGHT AS WELL 
I HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD TAKE OFF AT ALL 
COS WE'VE GOT SO MANY DRUNKS HERE IN THE PARK AND THAT 
AND THE VANDALISM BUT NOTHING 
IT'S JUST FANTASTIC IT IS 
JUST PLEASED VERY PLEASED 
IT'S NICE TO BE PROVED WRONG 
WELL I DARE SAY THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF PLANTS 
IN THOSE WONDERFUL CONTRAPTIONS AT HOXTON 
THAT WOULD BE REALLY BRILLIANT IN MONTY'S SANCTUARY GARDEN HERE 
LOTS OF THINGS THAT SMELL WONDERFUL 
AND TASTE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL 
BUT I'M GOING TO INVESTIGATE FIRST OF ALL THAT WHOLE IDEA OF COLOUR 
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MONTY HAD INTENDED 
TO HAVE LOTS OF ORANGE AND BLUE TOGETHER 
TO GET THIS INCREDIBLE CONTRAST BETWEEN THESE TWO OPPOSITE COLOURS 
AND I'M GOING TO USE TWO VERY SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD HARDY ANNUALS 
I'M GOING TO USE SOME CORNFLOWERS 
AND THIS IS ONE CALLED BLUE DIADEM 
AND I'M GOING TO USE ESCHSCHOLZIA 
A CALIFORNIAN POPPY 
THAT'S GOT THESE GREAT BIG BRILLIANT ORANGE CHALICES 
THAT JUST OPEN WITH THE SUN 
BUT JUST SO I KNOW 
ALTHOUGH THIS IS A VERY ACCIDENTAL SORT OF WAY OF DOING THIS 
BUT JUST SO I'VE GOT SOME CONTROL OVER IT 
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO MIX THEM 
WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF SAND 
IN ACTUAL FACT 
FOR THIS CORNFLOWER THE BLUE DIADEM 
I'M GOING TO USE GRIT 
COS I'LL BE ABLE TO SEE EXACTLY WHERE I'VE BEEN THEN WITH THIS 
IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO SOW HARDY ANNUALS OUTSIDE 
THEY'LL FLOWER A LITTLE BIT LATER THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE 
AND THERE IT IS 
THIS BEAUTIFUL QUITE SORT OF BIG PALE COLOURED SEED 
WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT DIRECTLY ON THERE 
BUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST MIX IT GRADUALLY 
IN WITH THIS GRAVEL 
NOW SINCE IT'S A SANCTUARY GARDEN 
I THINK WE OUGHT TO TRY AND INSTEAD OF SOWING IN BLOCKS 
WE OUGHT TO SOW THEM IN A GREAT BIG WAVE 
NOW THIS HAS BEEN FINELY RAKED THIS SOIL IT'S A NICE TILL 
AND I WANT TO START OVER THERE 
AND THEN JUST COME IN A GENTLE SORT OF 
VERY SENSUAL SORT OF CURVE ACROSS HERE 
AND THEN I'M GOING TO MIX THIS ESCHSCHOLZIA 
NOW IT'S A CALIFORNIAN POPPY 
AND IT ACTUALLY GROWS IN WONDERFUL SORT OF SAND DUNES 
AND ALONGSIDE THE COAST IN CALIFORNIA 
AND I'M GONNA MIX IT WITH SAND WHICH IT WILL ADORE 
THIS SOIL IS REALLY QUITE QUITE HEAVY 
AND THESE SEEDS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT 
THEY'RE SMALL BLACK AND ROUND 
ROUND BECAUSE THEY SORT OF ROLL AROUND 
AMONGST THE SAND AND JUST PUT THEMSELVES INTO NOOKS AND CRANNIES 
SO THERE DON'T LOOK TO BE MANY SEEDS IN THERE 
BUT THERE'S PROBABLY BETWEEN FIFTY AND ONE HUNDRED 
AND I'M JUST GOING TO MIX THEM INTO THIS SAND 
SO I CAN SEE VAGUELY WHERE THEY'RE GOING 
I'M JUST GOING TO CAST IT ALL OVER HERE 
SO WE'LL HAVE THAT BRILLIANT BLUE 
LIT BY THESE GREAT BIG ORANGE CHALICES 
COLOUR HAS VISUAL IMPACT BUT ARGUABLY 
TOUCH IS A MUCH MORE IMMEDIATE AND PERSONAL SENSE THAN SIGHT 
AND PLANTS DON'T GET MUCH MORE TOUCHY FEELY THAN SALVIA ARGENTEA 
I'M PUTTING THESE BEAUTIFUL PLANTS WITHIN EASY STROKING DISTANCE 
ALONG THE FRONT WALL 
WHERE THEY'LL SOON START FILLING OUT THE SPACE 
AS LONG AS THE SLUGS DON'T GET THEM 
THAT IS A EUROPEAN PLANT 
IT'S A BIANNUAL IT'LL FLOWER WITH THESE WONDERFUL WHITE FLOWERS 
AND THE WHOLE THING IS FURRY 
BUT WE'VE GOT QUITE A FEW INDIGENOUS PLANTS THAT ARE FURRY TOO 
AND THAT COULD GO IN HERE 
AND THIS NATIVE VERBASCUM AARON'S ROD 
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ANYWHERE WHERE THERE ARE CHALKY ESCARPMENTS 
OFTEN ON THE SIDE OF MOTORWAYS 
PLACES LIKE KENT AND HAMPSHIRE 
NOW IT'S A BIANNUAL IT ONLY LASTS TWO YEARS 
BUT THERE'S A GREAT DEMAND FOR PERENNIAL VERBASCUMS 
AND THIS IS ONE OF THEIR PARENTS 
WE WENT TO VISIT VIC JOHNSTONE AND CLAIRE WILSON 
TO HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE WORK THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING 
IN HYBRIDISING 
WE FIRST GOT INVOLVED WHEN WE SAW WILD HYBRIDS GROWING IN KENT 
AND WE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE QUITE INTERESTING 
TO DO SOME OF OUR OWN HYBRIDISATION 
IT GOT US WONDERING IF YOU COULD GET WONDERFUL HYBRIDS LIKE THAT 
FROM THE FEW BRITISH SPECIES THAT WE'VE GOT 
WHAT COULD YOU DO IF YOU COLLECTED ALL THE FOREIGN ONES TOGETHER 
THAT MIGHT VERY WELL NEVER MEET IN NATURE 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO ENSURE THAT THE PLANT IS PERENNIAL 
IF IT ISN'T PERENNIAL WE DROP IT 
BECAUSE THE GENERAL PUBLIC WANTS A PLANT THAT'S GOING TO SURVIVE 
LONGER THAN ONE YEAR 
THEN WE'RE OBVIOUSLY ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW AND EXCITING COLOUR BREAKS 
BECAUSE I THINK THE STANDARD HYBRID VERBASCUM UNTIL NOW 
HAS OFTEN BEEN JUST PERHAPS SLIGHTLY DREARY 
WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN BREEDING MORE AND MORE OF THE RED TERRACOTTA 
ORANGEY TONES BECAUSE THIS SIMPLY HAS NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE 
ALMOST ALL OF THE WILD VERBASCUMS ARE YELLOW FLOWERED 
BUT THE IDEA OF HAVING RED IN A VERBASCUM WAS INTRIGUING 
ALTHOUGH WE PRODUCED LOTS AND LOTS OF HYBRIDS 
THEY WERE MAINLY UP UNTIL RECENTLY PASTEL COLOURS 
WE TRIED AN AWFUL LOT OF DIFFERENT PARENTS 
AND THEN QUITE BY ACCIDENT ONE DAY 
WE SPOTTED ONE COMING INTO FLOWER 
THAT WAS BLOOD RED 
WE'VE CALLED IT FIREDANCE 
AND WE'RE PROPAGATING LARGE NUMBERS OF THEM HERE NOW 
IT'S NOT ON THE MARKET YET BUT WE HOPE THAT IT WILL BE 
MERLIN' IS ONE OF OUR FAVOURITES 
AND IT'S GOT THESE LOVELY LARGE PALE PURPLE FLOWERS 
IT IS ALSO VERY VERY TOUGH 
WE LEAVE IT OUT ALL WINTER 
AND IT SURVIVES PRETTY WELL 
BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT PEST OF VERBASCUMS IS THE MULLEIN MOTH 
THE MOTH COMES ALONG AND LAYS ITS EGGS IN APRIL 
AND THE CATERPILLARS HATCH IN MAY 
AND YOU HAVE TO CATCH THEM WHEN THEY'RE VERY SMALL 
COS IF YOU LET THEM GET BIG THEY WILL DEFOLIATE A PLANT OVERNIGHT 
WE SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME 
PICKING CATERPILLARS OFF THE PLANTS 
IT CERTAINLY BEGAN AS A HOBBY 
BUT IT QUICKLY OUTGREW THE BACK GARDEN 
AND WE HAD TO FIND A PIECE OF LAND 
NOW WE'VE GOT ABOUT AS MANY PLANTS 
AS WE CAN POSSIBLY LOOK AFTER AT ONE TIME 
WELL VERBASCUMS HAVE THEIR PROBLEMS WITH MULLEIN MOTHS 
BUT TULIPS HAVE THEIR TROUBLES TOO 
AND YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY I'M DIGGING OUT THESE BEAUTIFUL TULIPS 
WELL IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT TULIP BREAKING VIRUS 
THESE GORGEOUS SORT OF YELLOW STRIATIONS 
WHICH ARE SOMETIMES WHITE TOO 
ARE ACTUALLY CAUSED BY THIS VIRUS 
IT ALSO AFFECTS THE LEAVES 
SOMETIMES THEY'RE VERY VERY MOTTLED 
AND EVENTUALLY IT LEADS TO THE BULBS BECOMING VERY WEAK 
AND SOMETIMES NOT FLOWERING AT ALL 
AT ONE TIME A FLOWER LIKE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHLY PRIZED 
AT THE HEIGHT OF TULIP MANIA IN HOLLAND 
IN AMSTERDAM YOU COULD BUY A GOOD HOUSE 
FOR THE SAME PRICE AS YOU MIGHT PAY FOR A TULIP LIKE THIS 
BUT OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THOSE BULBS WERE VIRUSED 
WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO NOW IS DESTROY THIS WHOLE BULB 
JUST GET RID OF IT COMPLETELY 
WELL THERE WON'T BE ANY SUCH IMPERFECTIONS 
AT THE CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW THAT STARTS NEXT WEEK 
I KNOW IT CAN BE A VERY FRAUGHT TIME 
I'VE EXHIBITED THERE A FEW TIMES MYSELF 
BUT FOR RACHEL DE THAME IT'S HER VERY VERY FIRST EXHIBITION GARDEN 
AND WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING HER PROGRESS ON THE RUN UP TO CHELSEA 
I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD HONESTLY SAY I'M ENJOYING IT YET 
I'M FEELING THE PRESSURE ALREADY 
AND I SUSPECT I'M GONNA FEEL LIKE THIS UNTIL THE END OF THE PRESS DAY 
AND THEN I'LL GO PHEW 
MY BACKGROUND ISN'T IN DESIGN 
I'M INTERESTED IN PLANTS 
GETTING A TEAM TOGETHER CAME INTO IT VERY EARLY ON 
I WORK WITH A NURSERY CALLED CLIFTON NURSERY 
I THINK IT'S THE OLDEST LONDON NURSERY 
THEY VERY MUCH HELP ME GET THE IDEA FROM MY HEAD INTO PRESENTABLE FORM 
I WANTED IT TO BE A SORT OF URBAN HAVEN 
ALMOST IF YOU LIKE TO HAVE A FEEL OF THE COUNTRY 
IN THE CITY BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT IT'S IN THE CITY 
AND THEREFORE BE STRUCTURAL AND CONTEMPORARY AND QUITE RELIANT ON 
HARD LANDSCAPING WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT I WOULDN'T DO AT ALL 
LONDON IT'S AN URBAN GARDEN AND A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT I PASSED AND EXHIBITIONS I WENT TO 
AND LANDMARKS THAT I KNEW EXISTED AND INTERESTS THAT I HAVE 
IN FILM AND FASHION AND ART THAT ALL CAME INTO IT AS WELL 
I SAW THIS INCREDIBLE IMAGE OF PADDY FIELDS 
IT WAS ALL OF THESE TIERED PLANTING LEVELS CUT INTO THE HILLSIDE 
AND I LOVED THE WAY THAT THEY UNDULATED AROUND AND ROSE UP 
SO THAT IN A SMALL SPACE YOU CAN PLANT BY GOING UP THE WALL 
THERE'S AN EXHIBITION ON CURRENTLY AT THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM 
CALLED THE GOLDEN AGE OF COUTURE 
FOR ME IT JUST SEEMED RIGHT 
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT IT ABOUT THE ELEGANCE OF THE LINE 
THE COLOURS THE BLACK AND WHITE AND THE RED AND SO ON 
PARTLY IT WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR MY FAIR LADY HATS 
AND IT WAS THIS PICTURE OF AUDREY HEPBURN 
WITH THIS WONDERFUL WIDE BRIMMED HAT THAT WAS ON AN ANGLE 
AND I TOOK THAT AND I USED THAT ANGLE AND IMAGINED THAT IT WAS 
GOING INTO THE GROUND ON ONE SIDE 
AND IT'S GOT THIS GREAT ENORMOUS SCULPTURE IN IT 
IT'S GOING TO BE AN ENGINEERING NIGHTMARE 
IT'S NEARLY EIGHT MONTHS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE DESIGN PROCESS 
I'M BACK FOR MY THIRD VISIT TO SEE HOW THE SCULPTURAL STRUCTURE IS PROGRESSING 
IT'S QUITE DOMINANT ISN'T IT 
FRANKLY I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS 
WITH REGARD TO THE STRINGING FROM MY POINT OF VIEW 
I HAVE FROM THE BEGINNING BEEN ASKING TO GET IT MADE IN CABLE 
IT'S LIKE TIGHTENING SPOKES ON A WHEEL 
TIGHTEN TWO OR THREE THEN THAT ONE GOES AND YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT ONE 
WHAT'S YOUR THINKING WITH THE ELASTIC THEN 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT IT IN THAT MATERIAL THAT SAYS THAT IT'S NOT A PERMANENT STRUCTURE 
IT FEELS TO ME THAT IT WOULDN'T LAST AND IT WOULD LOOK DIRTY 
THE MINUTE IT'S IN STEEL 
IT JUST HAS THAT PERMANENCE ABOUT IT THAT I'D IMAGINED 
ANYTHING MORE PULLING ON THAT 
AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR TROUBLE 
WE CAN QUITE HAPPILY PUT ELEVEN CABLES ON THERE 
SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE SEE WHETHER IT'S A LOOK YOU LIKE 
THAT'S NO PROBLEM THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS THAT WILL NOT TAKE IT 
IT'S NOT WHAT I'D IMAGINED AT THE OUTSET SO I'M HAVING A FEW PROBLEMS GETTING BEYOND THAT 
THE NEXT TIME I ACTUALLY SEE THIS IS GONNA BE AT CHELSEA ITSELF WHEN IT ARRIVES ON THE SHOWGROUND 
THEN WE HAVE THE PROBLEM OF MANOEUVRING IT INTO PLACE 
IT'S ALL LOGISTICS 
THERE'S LOADS MORE TO COME ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
JOE WILL BE CONTINUING WITH HIS PATIO GARDEN HERE AT BERRYFIELDS 
REFLECTING THE CHANGING WAY LOTS OF US HAVE TO GARDEN 
WE'LL BE CATCHING UP WITH RACHEL DE THAME AS D. DAY APPROACHES FOR HER CHELSEA SHOW GARDEN 
AND ALYS IS GOING TO BE IN THE FORMAL GARDEN WITH OUR PRESENTERS' SWEET PEAS 
AND PUTTING IN LOTS OF LOVELY STUFF TO COMPLIMENT THEM 
LAST CHRISTMAS MONTY MADE THIS RATHER SPLENDID STRUCTURE 
FROM LOCALLY SOURCED HAZEL POLES IT'S GOOD AND STRONG 
AND AESTHETICALLY PLEASING BUT OF COURSE 
THE INTENTION WAS TO USE IT AS A SCAFFOLDING FOR SOME PLANTS 
AND WE'RE GOING TO USE SOMETHING REALLY INTRIGUING 
ALTHOUGH THIS WONDERFUL TUNNEL IS PART OF THE EDIBLE VEGETABLE GARDEN 
I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY LOVELY TO GROW SOMETHING THERE WHICH IS COMPLETELY SELF INDULGENT 
TOTALLY ORNAMENTAL AND TO THAT END 
I'M GOING TO SOW SOME OF THESE BEAUTIFUL ORNAMENTAL GOURDS 
NOW YOU CAN'T EAT THEM BUT THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS 
I THINK IT'LL BE A REALLY DECORATIVE WAY INTO THE VEGETABLE GARDEN FROM THAT END 
THEY BELONG TO THE CUCURBIT FAMILY 
SAME FAMILY AS MELONS COURGETTES PUMPKINS SQUASHES THE WHOLE LOT 
AND THE THING THAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON IS THEIR SEEDS 
THE SEEDS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME SORT OF SHAPE 
SOME OF THEM ARE BIGGER SOME ARE SMALLER 
BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS SORT OF FLAT AND IF YOU TURN THEM ON THEIR SIDE 
THEY'RE INCREDIBLY THIN 
THEY ALL HAVE A POINTY END 
AND THE TRICK REALLY IS RATHER THAN JUST SOW THEM LIKE THAT WHERE THEY MIGHT ROT 
IS TO TAKE THE SEED FIND THE POINTY END 
STICK IT INTO THE COMPOST AND JUST PUSH IT RIGHT INTO THE COMPOST LIKE THAT 
SO IT'S JUST BURIED BY ABOUT THE SAME DEPTH OF SOIL 
NOW IT'S MID MAY AND THESE ARE GOING TO GERMINATE REALLY RAPIDLY 
BY THE TIME THEY GO OUT ALL DANGER OF FROST SHOULD HAVE GONE 
SO THIS IS THE MELON BED NOW LAST YEAR WE HAD A MELON BED 
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE TRIED USING THE VICTORIAN TECHNIQUE 
AND IT JUST DIDN'T WORK 
THE TEMPERATURE NEVER REALLY GOT UP IT WAS A BAD SUMMER AND WE HAD TWO REALLY POOR PLANTS 
I WAS ALL FOR GIVING UP ON MELONS THINKING IT WAS TOO MUCH EFFORT 
BUT MONTY WAS LIKE NO WE'VE GOT TO HAVE MELONS 
SO I WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND THIS IS OUR NEW MELON BED 
IT'S DIFFERENT IN TWO WAYS FROM THE MELON BED OVER THERE FIRSTLY 
IT GOES DOWN INTO THE GROUND WE DUG OUT FOR ABOUT HALF A METRE 
AND THE IDEA IS THAT THE SOIL AND THE THERMAL HEAT BELOW WILL 
INSULATE ALL THE DONKEY POO THE OTHER THING THAT WAS DIFFERENT 
IS WE WERE REALLY SELECTIVE ABOUT THE DONKEY POO 
AND WE ONLY WENT FOR REALLY FRESH STUFF AND WE RELIGIOUSLY TURNED IT FOR FOURTEEN DAYS 
AND ON DAY FOURTEEN IT REALLY HEATED UP AND WAS ALMOST LETTING OFF STEAM 
AND THEN WE DUMPED IT IN HERE AND THEN ON THE ADVICE OF BARNSDALE 
WE PUT OUR OWN COMPOST ON TOP AND THEN 
WE SAT AND WAITED AND HERE'S THE EXTRAORDINARY THING 
AND IN THE EVENINGS IT DROPS DOWN TO ABOUT EIGHTEEN DEGREES 
BUT IT'S REALLY GIVING OFF HEAT IT'S BEEN CONSTANTLY LIKE THAT FOR THREE WEEKS 
WE'VE CHOSEN TWO DIFFERENT MELONS 
ONE OF THEM IS SWEETHEART 
WHICH IS AN F. ONE VARIETY THAT WE USED LAST YEAR 
AND IT'S ESPECIALLY BRED FOR OUTDOOR USE 
THE OTHER ONE IS A FOUR HUNDRED YEAR OLD VARIETY CALLED PETIT CRIS DE RENNES 
AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE CHAMPAGNE OF MELONS 
AND IT'S ALSO A LOW HEAT REQUIREMENT ONE SO THEY'RE BOTH SUITED FOR OUTDOOR USE 
AND I RECKON IN THIS SPACE I'M PROBABLY ONLY GONNA GET TWO MELONS 
COS THEY'RE QUITE BIG RAMBLING PLANTS 
SO I'M GONNA GO FOR ONE HERE 
THIS MAY BE A VERY OLD FASHIONED WAY TO GROW MELONS IT'S BEEN AROUND SINCE THE VICTORIANS 
BUT AT THE END THE DONKEY POO WILL BE REUSED AROUND THE GARDEN 
THE FRAME WILL BECOME SOMETHING ELSE AND WE'VE GOT FREE HEAT 
OOH 
HELLO HOW ARE YOU DOING 
I'M ON A SCROUNGE HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING FOR THE ALLOTMENT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE 
SO I BROUGHT YOU A COUPLE OF PRESSIES FROM 
FROM OUR HOUSE FROM YOUR PLACE YEAH LOVELY 
LOVELY CHARD YEAH OH LISTEN TO HIM 
YOU IDENTIFIED IT IMMEDIATELY WELL I KNOW WHAT CHARD LOOKS LIKE 
FOR CONNIE AND STANLEY REALLY YEAH LOVELY 
YOU CAN FIGHT ABOUT WHO HAS WHICH 
AND THESE ARE SOME CLIMBING BEANS FOR YOU GO AND HAVE A CHAT WITH ALYS 
YEAH I'M GONNA SEE IF ALYS HAS GOT ANYTHING I CAN PILFER 
AND ALSO JUST HAVE A LOOK AROUND THESE BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED BEDS 
NEARLY AS GOOD AS YOURS NEARLY AS NICE AS MINE 
FUNNY SHAPE THOUGH THESE THEY'RE ALL RECTANGULAR I KNOW STRANGE SHAPE TO HAVE 
I LIKE THOSE TRIANGLES 
JOE AND HIS TRIANGULAR BEDS I LIKE THEM I THINK THEY'RE GREAT 
COMPLETELY ORIGINAL JUST LIKE HIM 
WELL THAT WHOLE THING OF PROPAGATING STUFF AND SWAPPING IT 
IS AT THE HEART OF PROPER GARDENING 
AND BACK HOME IN DEVON I'VE BEEN HELPING JO RUSSELL AND FIN TO START A REALLY SUSTAINABLE GARDEN 
BUT IF THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY GARDEN 
FIRST OF ALL THEY'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE GARDEN ITSELF 
ON THE COAST IN NORTH DEVON 
JOE AND RUSS' GARDEN HAS UNDERGONE SOME BIG CHANGES 
IN PREPARATION FOR THE NEXT STAGE IN THE GARDEN CYCLE 
THEY BID FAREWELL TO THE ENORMOUS SHED 
AND TODAY THE RAISED VEG BEDS ARE GOING TO TAKE CENTRE STAGE 
IT IS ENORMOUS ISN'T IT IT REALLY IS HUGE 
WHEN THE SHED WAS THERE YOU COULDN'T REALLY TELL NO 
WE KNEW THERE WAS A FAIR AMOUNT OF SPACE 
BUT UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY SEE IT VISUALLY 
I'VE DONE A FEW PLANS THIS IS THIS AREA HERE 
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER WE'RE GONNA HAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO DO THIS BUT 
IT'S NICE IT'S VERY ARTISTIC 
THIS SORT OF SPIRAL OF LIFE GEOMETRY I'VE PUT A BIT OF MOVEMENT 
THAT'S IT BUT IT WOULDN'T GROW NEARLY AS MUCH VEG AS THIS RIGHT 
AND THAT'S THE OBJECT TO THE EXERCISE 
IT IS LOTS OF LOVELY VEG 
AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA MAKE IT OUT OF 
WELL THE GUYS THAT HAD THE SHED 
BLESS THEM HAVE GIVEN US A LOAD OF TONGUE AND GROOVE 
LENGTHS OF PLANK I GUESS WE THOUGHT WE COULD TRY AND PUT THOSE TOGETHER 
HAVE TWO HIGH RAISED BEDS 
THERE'S QUITE A PILE OF THIS 
IT WORKS QUITE SIMPLY DOESN'T IT 
GIVE US A DEMO SO THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIT IN THERE 
THERE WE GO THAT'S GOOD AND I THINK THAT SORT OF WIDTH IS JUST ABOUT RIGHT 
IT'S NICE AND HIGH BUT YOU CAN EXCAVATE AS WELL 
SO YOU CAN GO DOWN EVEN DEEPER OH O. K. IT WON'T JUST BE THAT DEPTH IT'LL BE EVEN BIGGER 
WHEN YOU'RE MAKING NEW FEATURES IN YOUR GARDEN MARKING OUT 
HELP YOU VISUALISE THE FINISHED RESULT EXCITING 
THE BEDS NEED TO BE WIDE ENOUGH FOR PLENTY OF VEG 
BUT NOT SO WIDE THAT YOU CAN'T REACH INTO THEM 
ABOUT FOUR FEET ACROSS IS PERFECT 
THIS IS RECYCLING AT ITS BEST 
THE SECOND HAND TONGUE AND GROOVE TIMBER IS A GREAT PART EXCHANGE FOR THE SHED 
THE GARDEN'S CHANGING FOR THE BETTER THE LENGTH OF WOOD 
WILL BE ATTACHED TO OLD POSTS LOVINGLY FASHIONED BY JO'S DAD GRAHAM 
ONCE THE BOARDS HAVE BEEN COLOURED WITH ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WOOD STAIN 
THEY'RE SCREWED INTO THE POSTS IN PREPARATION FOR THE ALL IMPORTANT SOIL A FEW MILES AWAY 
IN A FIELD OWNED BY RUSS' WORK IS MY IDEA OF A PERFECT LOCAL PRODUCE 
RUSS HAS HAD PERMISSION THROUGH HIS WORK TO TAKE AS MUCH OF THIS TOP SOIL AS HE WANTS 
THERE'S A HUGE STACK OF SOIL THERE'S A LOT YEAH 
THIS IS ALL AVAILABLE FOR US TO USE 
WE CAN TAKE PLENTY OF THIS IT LOOKS FANTASTIC TOO 
THE QUALITY OF IT LOOK AT THAT YEAH BRILLIANT STUFF 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKS QUITE SANDY 
IT'S FANTASTIC AND IT'S VERY LIGHT AND SANDY 
JUST LIKE YOUR OWN SOIL WHICH I THINK IS QUITE IMPORTANT IT IS REALLY LOCAL 
SO VERY VERY FREE DRAINING NOT GOING TO HOLD ANY MOISTURE AT ALL 
BUT SO EASY TO CULTIVATE 
IT'S FABULOUS 
YOU CAN TELL THAT DESPITE IT BEING SANDY 
IT'S QUITE DARK SOIL AND THAT MEANS IT'S FULL OF HUMUS WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANT 
IT'S WHAT MAKES YOUR SOIL LIVE YOU KNOW 
LET'S GO TO THE MINIBUS WITH AS MANY BAGS AS WE CAN CARRY 
IT'S BACK TO THE GARDEN TO CREATE THE PERFECT SCENARIO 
FOR JO AND RUSS TO GROW THEIR OWN IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO LOADS OF LOVELY FREE TOP SOIL 
YOU CAN STILL EDGE THE BEDS BUT DIG AS DEEPLY AS YOU CAN INSTEAD OF RAISING THE SURFACE HIGHER 
THIS IS PROBABLY THE LAST TIME YOU'LL WALK ON THESE BEDS 
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO APPROACH EVERYTHING FROM THE EDGES 
WALKING ON SOIL REALLY RUINS THE STRUCTURE OF IT BUT THESE WILL JUST BUILD UP THEIR OWN INTERNAL LIFE 
AND YOU'LL PROBABLY NEVER HAVE TO DIG AGAIN EITHER 
BRILLIANT 
A GOOD DEPTH OF SOIL IS VITAL IN THESE BEDS 
FOR PRODUCTIVE GROWING 
WE'RE USING EVERYTHING WE CAN GET OUR HANDS ON 
INCLUDING THESE TURFS 
WHICH WERE THE ONES WE LIFTED WHEN WE MADE JO AND RUSS' NURSERY BED A FEW WEEKS AGO 
THE GRASS HAS ALREADY GONE BROWN 
AND THESE TURFS WILL SOON BECOME GOOD LOAN 
WHEN THEY'RE IN PLACE WE CAN TOP UP WITH OUR RECYCLED SOIL 
THIS IS THE REALLY ACTIVE PART OF IT 
FROM NOW ON IN 
ONCE THESE ARE MADE IT'S JUST GOING TO BE CULTIVATION 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT THAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE GROWING STUFF I HOPE SO 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT WHEN ALL THOSE LITTLE SEEDLINGS START COMING THROUGH 
WELL BACK HERE IN THE TINY PATIO GARDEN 
I'M GETTING ON WITH THE PLANTING 
AND WHAT I'VE DONE HERE 
COS TERRACOTTA TAKES THE MOISTURE OUT OF THE SOIL SO QUICKLY 
I'VE LINED THE LARGE POT WITH AN OLD COMPOST BAG 
I'VE SLITTED THE BOTTOM OF IT SO IT'S GOT FREE DRAINAGE 
AND AT THE BOTTOM I'VE PUT SOME POLYSTYRENE 
NOW THAT'S ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT FOR DRAINAGE AND IT'S QUITE LIGHTWEIGHT 
AND THEN THE COMPOST THAT I'M USING 
IS SOME PEAT FREE COMPOST WITH SOME ADDED SEAWEED IN IT 
AND THAT'S GONNA FEED THE PLANTS THROUGH THE SUMMER 
BUT ALSO RETAIN A BIT OF MOISTURE TOO 
AND BECAUSE THIS WHOLE TINY GARDEN IS SOUTH FACING IT GETS LOADS OF SUN 
AND THIS WALL GETS BAKED THROUGH THE SUMMER 
WHICH MEANS I CAN GROW THIS WONDERFUL JASMINE 
THIS IS JASMINE POLYANTHUM 
AND IT'S GROWN COMMONLY AS AN INDOOR JASMINE 
BUT I THINK IT'S GONNA DO REALLY WELL HERE THROUGH THE SUMMER 
AND EVEN IF IT DOESN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE WINTER 
WE'LL GET ONE GOOD SUMMER OUT OF IT AND IT SMELLS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS 
AND IT WILL FILL THIS TINY SPACE ALL SUMMER LONG 
BECAUSE IT'S VERY PROLIFIC AS FAR THE FLOWERS ARE CONCERNED 
EVEN IF IT LASTS ONE YEAR AND WE GET LOTS OF FLOWERS AND SCENT OUT OF IT 
WELL THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME 
SO I'M JUST KNOCKING IT OUT OF THE POT 
I'M JUST PLACING IT THERE 
JUST SLIGHTLY LEAN IT BACK TOWARDS THE WALL 
BUT IT'S FINE AT THE MOMENT ON THE CANES BUT OVER TIME I MIGHT 
PUT SOME WIRES UP THE WALL AND JUST TRAIN IT ALONG A LITTLE BIT MORE 
SO THE NEXT THING TO DO IS BACK FILL IT WITH SOME COMPOST 
JUST FIRM IT IN THERE 
AND THEN AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE PLANT 
I'VE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRAM SOME MORE IN THERE 
I'VE DECIDED TO GO FOR SOME LAVENDERS HERE 
THIS IS LAVANDULA ANGUSTIFOLIA 
WHICH ACTUALLY GETS QUITE BIG BUT I'M JUST USING THEM FOR THIS YEAR 
AS A SORT OF BEDDING PLANT REALLY 
AND YOU GET THAT LITTLE WONDERFUL AROMATIC FOLIAGE 
AND THE PURPLY BLUE FLOWERS LATER ON 
BUT ONCE THEY'VE OUTGROWN THEIR SPACE 
I CAN JUST POT THEM ON AND START FILLING THIS GARDEN UP 
SO THEY'RE JUST GONNA BE IN HERE FOR THE SUMMER 
THAT'S FOUR I ALWAYS LIKE TO PLANT IN FIVES IF POSSIBLE 
IT JUST SEEMS TO GIVE A NATURAL RHYTHM TO THE PLANTING 
I'M GONNA POP ONE MORE IN ROUND THE BACK THERE 
AND AS I SAID IT GETS PLENTY OF SUN THIS SPOT 
SO THE LAVENDER'S GONNA ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT 
AND THERE YOU GO 
MY FIRST PLANT IN THIS TINY LITTLE PATIO GARDEN 
AND IT LOOKS GREAT AND IT SMELLS GREAT TOO 
JUST GOTTA HAVE A WAFT OF THAT BEFORE I MOVE ON 
NOW THE NEXT THING I WANT TO DO IS START USING THIS WALL SPACE 
BECAUSE IN A SMALL SPACE LIKE THIS THIS IS ALL FREE SPACE FOR PLANTING 
AND THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT I'D DO WAS MAKE UP A COUPLE OF WINDOW BOXES 
JUST TO FIT NICELY UNDER THIS WINDOW JUST SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE 
USING SOME OF THE TIMBER THAT'S KNOCKING AROUND BERRYFIELDS 
MY WINDOW BOXES ARE EIGHTY C. M. LONG THIRTY C. M. WIDE AND THIRTY C. M. DEEP 
TO FIT THE WINDOWS 
NOW FIRST I'M MAKING THE TWO ENDS 
I'M USING SMALL GRAVEL BOARDS FOR THE MAIN PANELLING 
I'VE CUT THEM TO SIZE AND LINING THREE OF THEM UP 
AND THEN NAILING THEM DIRECTLY TO THESE BATTENS TO CREATE A FRAME 
I'M USING OVAL WIRE NAILS TO STOP THE WOOD SPLITTING 
NEXT UP ARE THE FOUR LEGS WHICH ARE ALSO MADE FROM ROOFING BATTENS 
BUT I'VE CUT THESE A LITTLE LONGER 
SO THEY PROTRUDE A BIT AT THE TOP AND A BIT LONGER AT THE BOTTOM 
I'M SCREWING THESE RATHER THAN NAILING THEM FOR ADDED STRENGTH 
THE LONGER SIDE PANELS ARE MADE IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY 
AND THEN SCREWED ONTO THE LEGS OF THE SIDE PANELS TO COMPLETE THE UNIT 
THE BOTTOM'S EASY IT'S JUST A FEW PIECES OF STANDARD LENGTH 
GRAVEL BOARD PIECES CUT TO SIZE 
AND NAILED ON 
WELL I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH THEM I THINK THEY LOOK GREAT 
AND BECAUSE THE TIMBER HASN'T BEEN TREATED 
I'M PRESERVING IT BUT STAINING IT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S A COMBINATION 
AND ALSO I COULDN'T FIND THE EXACT COLOUR THAT I WANTED 
COS I WANTED TO TIE IT IN WITH THOSE WINDOW FRAMES THERE THE WOODEN BIT 
SO I PUT A BLACK BASE ON 
JUST SORT OF SPLOSHED IT ON TO DULL IT DOWN A BIT 
AND THEN I'M USING THIS MAHOGANY BROWN OVER THE TOP OF IT 
AND IT'S WORKING OUT REALLY WELL IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR 
SO I'M GONNA STAIN IT LET IT DRY FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS 
AND THEN START PLANTING 
MONTY MIGHT BE HAVING A BREAK BUT HIS SWEET PEAS ARE REALLY GROWING 
THERE'S BEEN SOME INEVITABLE SLUG DAMAGE 
AND SOME OF THEM ARE SULKING A LITTLE WHICH IS QUITE COMMON 
FOR SWEET PEAS IN EARLY TO MIDDLE MAY 
THEY OFTEN HAVE A SULKY PERIOD 
THEN JUST AS THE DAYS GET WARMER OFF THEY GROW 
SO YOU CAN GIVE THEM A BIT OF A FOLIAGE FEED 
BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT 
I'M JUST TYING THEM IN RIGHT NOW 
BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO GET UP AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
AND TYING IN IS THE SAME FOR ANY PLANT 
IT'S ALWAYS LOOSE AROUND THE STEM AND TIGHT AROUND THE STAKE 
SO YOU DO A FIGURE OF EIGHT 
AND THEN YOU DOUBLE UP AROUND THE STAKE JUST SO IT WON'T MOVE AROUND 
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL GROW AWAY 
NOW THIS GARDEN'S LOOKING A LITTLE BIT BARE 
AND I NEED TO FIND A PLANT THAT WILL 
FLOWER ITS SOCKS OFF CONTINUOUSLY ALL SUMMER LONG 
IN A COMPLEMENTARY PALETTE TO THESE SWEET PEAS WHICH ARE 
THE GEOFF HAMILTON PERCY THROWER ALAN TITCHMARSH AND MONTY DON 
WHICH ARE ALL IN A KIND OF PINK TO DARK PINK PALETTE 
SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS I'VE GOT HOLD OF SOME KNAUTIA MACEDONICA 
NOW THIS LOOKS VERY SIMILAR TO A SCABIOUS 
IT COMES FROM THE BALKANS AND IT IS JUST A FANTASTIC PLANT 
IF YOU'RE GONNA BUY ONE THING BUY THIS 
BECAUSE WHATEVER THE WEATHER IT WILL FLOWER ITS SOCKS OFF 
CONTINUOUSLY ALL SUMMER LONG 
IT'S JUST REALLY VALUE FOR MONEY 
AND IT'S A LOVELY SORT OF DEEP DARK 
KIND OF PINKY PURPLE SO I THINK IT WILL BE VERY COMPLEMENTARY 
SO I'M JUST GOING TO DOT IT AROUND 
AND TO BULK UP SUPPLIES I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS A PASTEL PINK 
VERSION IN HIS GARDEN AND IT'S SELF SEEDED ITSELF ALL OVER THE PLACE 
SO I'VE MANAGED TO GET A FEW OFF HIM 
NOW KNAUTIA LIKES TO GROW IN SORT OF FULL SUN TO PARTIAL SHADE 
AND IT'S PARTICULARLY DROUGHT TOLERANT 
SO IT'S GOOD IF YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BAKED BACK GARDEN 
THEY'RE SUCH HEALTHY STRONG GROWING HAPPY PLANTS 
THAT YOU REALLY JUST HAVE TO SHOVE THEM IN THE GROUND 
AND GIVE THEM A WATER AND I GUARANTEE THEY'LL BE OFF 
I ALSO GUARANTEE THEY'LL SELF SEED THEMSELVES ALL OVER YOUR GARDEN 
SO YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY OF THESE TO COME 
WHICH IS NO BAD THING COS YOU CAN START GIVING THEM AWAY TO FRIENDS 
ABSOLUTELY NO PRIZES FOR GUESSING WHAT I'VE CHOSEN 
FOR THE BEST OF BERRYFIELDS THIS WEEK 
HOW COULD IT HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE ELSE 
BUT IN THE LONG BORDERS WITH THESE GLORIOUS TULIPS 
SUCH AN INCREDIBLY FLAMBOYANT SHOW 
BURNS YOUR RETINA TO LOOK AT THEM AND JUST CHEERS YOU UP 
MONTY PLANTED TWO THOUSAND TULIPS IN HERE LAST NOVEMBER 
AND HE PLANTED THEM SOME FOR AN EARLIER SHOW 
AND SOME FOR A LATER SHOW 
BUT WE'VE HAD SUCH A WEIRD SEASON THAT THEY'VE ALL COME AT ONCE 
SO WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO THAN MAKE THE MOST OF THEM 
GLORIOUS RICH COLOURS LIKE 
ABU HASSAN WITH THESE MAHOGANY FLOWERS YELLOW EDGED 
AND THEN THESE FANTASTIC LILY FLOWERED TULIPS 
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL ELEGANT SHAPE 
AND PARROT TULIPS WITH THESE GREAT FLOWERING PETALS 
REALLY TOTALLY OVER THE TOP I JUST LOVE THEM ALL 
WELL JOE'S REALLY GETTING INTO HIS ALLOTMENT NOW 
HE'S HAD SOME VERY UNCONVENTIONAL IDEAS 
AND ALSO PLANTED SOME RATHER UNUSUAL CROPS 
BUT THIS WEEK HE'S CONCENTRATING ON SOME OF THOSE STAPLES 
THAT YOU ALWAYS ASSOCIATE WITH ALLOTMENTEERING 
JOE WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING 
TODAY IS BEANS AND PEAS DAY 
I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND THIS IS THE BEST WAY OF GROWING YOUR BEANS 
THIS IS DIG OUT A TRENCH 
UM ABOUT A SPIT AND A HALF DEEP 
AND THEN CHUCK JUST A LOAD OF OLD RUBBISH IN THE BOTTOM 
CARDBOARD FIRST O. K. WET IT DOWN 
THIS IS ALL ABOUT MOISTURE RETENTION 
TRYING TO GET AS MUCH MOISTURE IN THE BOTTOM OF THIS TRENCH AS POSSIBLE 
THE BEANS LOVE IT 
THEN ON TOP OF THAT SOME OLD NEWSPAPER JUST SHREDDED AND SOAKED 
NEARLY DONE THERE 
COS I'VE BEEN LOOKING ON THE INTERNET AND READING A COUPLE OF BOOKS 
AND APPARENTLY THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE NINJA WAY OF DOING IT 
HANG ON I'VE JUST GOT TO CHECK 
EXACTLY WHAT GOES IN NEXT O. K. 
CARDBOARD WET PAPER THEN SOME OLD GRASS CLIPPINGS 
I'M JUST GONNA THROW THAT IN 
UM I'VE GOT SOME GRASS CLIPPINGS FROM A JOB I WAS DOING 
AND THEN OLD COMPOST AS WELL IF YOU'VE GOT OLD COMPOST AROUND IN POTS 
OR WHATEVER A BIT OLD AND A BIT TIRED 
JUST CHUCK THAT IN AS WELL 
IT'S ALL GOOD STUFF 
SPREAD IT AROUND A BIT 
AND THEN SOME GRASS CLIPPINGS AS WELL 
AND THAT'LL ROT DOWN 
THAT'S GIVING A REALLY GOOD LAYER FOR THE BEANS TO GET THEIR ROOTS INTO 
THAT FLIPPIN' SQUEAKY BARROW IT'S DRIVING ME MAD 
USE SOME OIL FOR YOUR BARROW ALBINO 
YEAH BECAUSE IT'S BEEN THERE DON'T DO MUCH WORK 
OH IT DOESN'T DO MUCH WORK IT'S LAZY YOU CAN'T BLAME THE BARROW 
IT'S THE BARROW WRANGLER 
GET IT WORKING THE MORE IT WORKS THE LESS IT'LL SQUEAK I'VE GOT TO DO MY BEANS 
YEAH YOU DO TRY AND KEEP THE VOLUME DOWN ON THAT FLIPPIN' BARROW 
NEXT THING TO DO IS GIVE IT A BIT OF A FEED 
I'M USING SOME OF THIS JUST FISH BLOOD AND BONE 
JUST A GENERAL FEED I'M GONNA PUT A FEW HANDFULS OF THAT 
BE QUITE LIBERAL WITH IT SPRINKLE IT ON TOP OF THE GRASS 
AND ALSO ONTO THE SOIL THAT I'M BACKFILLING WITH AS WELL 
SO IT JUST GETS NICELY MIXED UP JUST GENERALLY INTO ALL THE SOIL 
NEXT THING TO DO IS TO BACKFILL THE TRENCH 
WITH THE SOIL 
SO THE NEXT THING IS TO GET THE STRUCTURE IN 
EVERYONE SEEMS TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY 
THE MAIN THING IS JUST TO DO IT AS WIDE AS THE 
THE PIT THAT YOU'VE DUG SO THERE 
AND THEN THERE 
THEN TIE THEM TOGETHER AT THE TOP THERE ARE NO SPECIAL KNOTS IN THIS 
IT IS ISN'T IT 
IT REALLY IS 
WELL WE WERE UP HERE PRETTY MUCH 
MUST HAVE BEEN FIVE OR SIX HOURS YESTERDAY WITH CATH AND THE KIDS 
UM AND CATH WEEDED OVER ALL THOSE DIAMOND AND TRIANGULAR BEDS 
I MEAN METICULOUSLY 
I THINK SHE FINDS IT QUITE THERAPEUTIC 
RIGHT AND NOW FOR THE BEANS 
I'M GONNA PUT ONE VARIETY ON ONE HALF AND ANOTHER ON THE OTHER HALF 
AND I'M GOING TO USE 
WHITE BEANS THESE HARICOT BEANS THEY LOOK DELICIOUS 
AND THEN THESE THESE ARE COBRA 
THESE ARE A CLIMBING FRENCH BEAN 
YOU'RE MEANT TO GET SO MANY BEANS OFF THEM THEY'RE QUITE PROLIFIC 
SO I'M GONNA GO FOR THOSE 
RIGHT 
SO I'M GOING TO POP THEM IN I'M GONNA PUT TWO AGAINST EACH CANE 
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS SO THAT 
BLACK ONES ON THIS SIDE COBRA ON THIS SIDE 
ONE GONE IN THERE AND THEN ONE PRETTY MUCH NEXT TO IT 
JUST ON THE SIDE SO THAT THE WEAKER ONE I TAKE OUT I'M LEFT WITH THE NICE STRONG ONE 
I'M PLANTING THEM ALSO AND THIS IS A REALLY GOOD TIP THAT I READ 
ON THE INSIDE OF THE CANES IF YOU PLANT ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CANES 
YOU'VE GOT TO STRAGGLE THEM OVER A BIT BUT ALSO 
FOR HOEING HERE I CAN GET THE HOE AND HOE ALL THE WAY THROUGH HERE 
AND I CAN'T GET ONTO THE INSIDE COS THE BAMBOO'S STOPPING ME 
THERE'S ACTUALLY A PHYSICAL BARRIER 
IT'S A BRILLIANT WAY FOR ME TO LEARN THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT 
I'M NOT A PERSON WITH A FORMAL EDUCATION 
STUDY THE BOOKS AND WORK OUT HOW TO DO IT BUT BY DOING THIS 
I'LL NEVER FORGET ANY OF THIS YOU KNOW 
POTATOES SEVEN DIFFERENT VARIETIES I KNOW WHICH ARE EARLIES AND LATES 
THE BEANS HOW TO PLANT BEANS HOW TO GROW THEM 
AND THEN WHEN I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ACTUALLY HARVESTING THEM 
I'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT BEANS AND PEAS AND ARTICHOKES AND SALADS 
AND ONIONS AND SHALLOTS SUDDENLY YOUR WHOLE RANGE EXPANDS 
IT'S PRETTY EXCITING IT'S GREAT I'M REALLY ENJOYING IT 
WELL WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE WAY PEOPLE GARDEN IS CHANGING 
THAT ALLOTMENT HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED THE WAY I GARDEN 
BACK HERE IN THE SMALL PATIO GARDEN I'M GETTING THESE WINDOW BOXES UP 
I'VE GOT ONE ALREADY UP PLANTED AND THIS ONE 
I'M GONNA FINISH OFF I'M LINING IT WITH AN OLD COMPOST BAG 
JUST LIKE I DID WITH THE TERRACOTTA POT IT HELPS WITH MOISTURE RETENTION 
AND PROTECT THE WOOD AT THE SAME TIME 
NOW I'M JUST GONNA 
PUT SOME COMPOST IN HERE 
AND I THINK THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD 
THEY'VE GONE VERY WELL WITH THE TRADITIONAL FACADE OF THE HOUSE 
NOTHING TOO CONTEMPORARY JUST GOING WITH THE FLOW 
AND THE PLANTING IS GOING TO BE PRETTY TRADITIONAL TOO 
JUST PUTTING IN SOME CLASSIC SUMMER BEDDING 
SO I'VE GONE FOR GERANIUMS AND IVY 
AND THESE ARE REALLY LOVELY GERANIUM 
FANTASTIC RED JUST COMING INTO FLOWER NOW 
AND THESE ARE A FIREWORKS VARIETY 
WHICH MEANS THEY'VE GOT A REALLY INTERESTING CUT FLOWER ON THEM 
AND THIS ONE'S CALLED SCARLET FOR OBVIOUS REASONS 
I'M PLACING FOUR OF THOSE THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THIS WINDOW BOX 
THEN THE IVY AT THE FRONT TO TRAIL OVER BREAK UP THE EDGE OF THE POT 
AND THEN I'M GONNA PUT A COUPLE OF THESE TRAILING BACOPA 
THESE LOVELY WHITE FLOWERS A SLIGHT SCENT TO THEM TOO 
JUST TO BREAK UP THE FRONT CORNERS 
AND THEN JUST BACKFILL WITH COMPOST KEEP SCOOPING IT OUT 
LOADS OF HANDFULS 
AND FIRM THEM IN AS YOU GO AROUND 
MAKING SURE THAT YOU DON'T LEAVE ANY AIR GAPS 
THEY'RE GONNA LOVE IT HERE BAKING SUN SOUTH FACING 
THESE GERANIUMS GIVE A MEDITERRANEAN FEEL 
YOU SEE THEM IN THE MEDITERRANEAN 
THEY FLOWER ALL SUMMER LONG KEEP DEAD HEADING THEM 
AND THEY'LL JUST KEEP FLOWERING FOR YOU 
GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY 
THERE YOU GO AND OF COURSE THE LAST THING YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT TO DO 
GIVE THEM A GOOD WATER IN 
IT CLEANS UP THE FOLIAGE AT THE SAME TIME AND THE WINDOWSILL 
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD TO ME NOW ALL I NEED HERE IS SOMEWHERE TO SIT 
IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD DOESN'T IT 
THE GOOD THING ABOUT SMALL SPACES LIKE THIS IS YOU CAN CREATE 
A LOT OF IMPACT IN JUST A FEW HOURS 
IF YOUR TIME IN THE GARDEN IS LIMITED 
YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT 
IF THERE'S JUST ONE THING YOU DO THIS WEEKEND 
TACKLE NEWLY EMERGING WEEDS 
USE A SHARP HOE TO CHOP OFF THE HEADS OF ANNUAL WEEDS 
BEFORE THEY GET INTO THEIR STRIDE 
CHOOSING A WARM DRY DAY TO DO IT 
FOLLOW THIS UP WITH AT LEAST A TWO INCH LAYER OF MULCH 
IN THIS CASE WE'RE USING A STRAW MULCH 
WHICH WILL DOUBLE AS PROTECTION FOR THE DEVELOPING STRAWBERRIES 
THIS SHOULD MEAN YOU WON'T HAVE TO WASTE TIME WEEDING AGAIN 
AND INSTEAD YOU CAN SPEND YOUR TIME WITH MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE ACTIVITIES 
WE LEFT RACHEL GRAPPLING WITH HER HARD LANDSCAPING 
AND SORTING OUT HER STRUCTURES FOR HER CHELSEA SHOW GARDEN 
BUT NOW WE CATCH UP WITH HER 
AS SHE REALLY GETS TO GRIPS WITH HER PLANTS 
THE MOST DIFFICULT THING HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO SOMETHING 
UM ORIGINAL AND PACK IN LOTS OF PLANTS WHICH IS WHAT I LOVE 
INTO A FIVE METRE BY FIVE METRE SPACE 
I WANTED TO USE BIG FLOWERS BIG BLOUSY FLOWERS 
SO ROSES AND I'M GOING TO PROVE I HOPE 
THAT YOU CAN USE MODERN DESIGN WITH ROSES 
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK MANY PEOPLE DO THAT 
SO LUCKILY CLIFTON HAVE GOT THIS BIT OF LAND WHICH IS NOT FAR FROM THEIR NURSERY 
AND WE'RE LITERALLY BUILDING THE GARDEN HERE LIKE A JIGSAW 
AND THIS LOOKS LIKE A BIG METAL 
YOU KNOW LUMP AT THE MOMENT BUT THAT'LL ALL BE CLAD IN SLATE 
THIS IS EFFECTIVELY A PLANTER SO IT'LL BE FILLED WITH THESE LAYERS OF ROSES 
ALSO THESE RAISED BEDS ARE WHAT CAME OUT OF 
THAT ORIGINAL INSPIRATION I HAD FROM THE PADDY FIELDS 
THIS IS THE SECTION THAT'S WORRYING ME 
THIS IS WHERE THAT SCULPTURAL STRUCTURE IS GOING ALONG HERE 
THEN OVER HERE THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BIG CERCIS THE FOREST PANSY 
SO WHAT I NEED TO CHECK THIS AFTERNOON 
WE'RE GOING TO WADDESDON WHERE MOST OF THE PLANTS ARE 
I'M GOING TO SEE THE TWO BIG CERCIS THAT LEN HAS FOUND 
FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SEE WHAT THE SPREAD IS LIKE 
WHILE WE'RE HERE NOW THOUGH LEN'S GOING TO HELP ME 
HE'S BROUGHT A WHOLE LOT OF PLANTS UP 
YEAH THAT IS LOVELY THAT'S REALLY NICE 
IT'S DIFFERENT FROM ALCHEMILLA MOLLIS ISN'T IT 
YEAH IT'S A MINIATURE ALCHEMILLA MOLLIS MUCH NICER 
I LIKE THAT FACT THAT IT'S GREEN RATHER THAN THAT YELLOW FLOWER 
IS THIS PEACH FLAMBE PEACH FLAMBE THAT YOU WANTED 
IT'S A NICE PLANT I THINK IT'S GREAT 
AND IT WILL EITHER WORK BRILLIANTLY WITH THE ROSES WE'VE CHOSEN 
OR IT'LL CLASH HORRIBLY 
THIS IS LOVELY IS THAT LIME RICKEY IT IS YEAH 
THAT'S GORGEOUS 
ALL IN ALL I THINK THIS IS INVALUABLE 
BEING ABLE TO DO THIS 
IS THIS THE ONLY ASTRANTIA WE'VE GOT SO FAR 
ASTRANTIA MAJOR'S A NICE ONE IT'S NOT OFTEN USED 
AND IT'S I LIKE THAT SLIGHTLY LARGER STARRY FLOWER 
LOOK AT THIS NOT A SLUG IN SIGHT YEAH 
THAT'S ALL LOOKING REALLY GOOD LEN LET'S GO AND SEE THE CERCIS YEAH 
OH GOSH 
WELL FROM HERE IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL 
BUT OF COURSE I'M SEEING TWO OF THEM 
YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESTING THEY DEFINITELY HAVE A GOOD AND BAD SIDE 
DON'T THEY YEAH THEY DO 
WE'VE GOT OUR HIGH WALL HAVEN'T WE UH HUH 
SO IT'S QUITE GOOD IF IT'S ONE SIDED IN SOME RESPECTS 
I'M A LITTLE BIT WORRIED THAT THEY'RE NOT IN TIP TOP CONDITION 
BUT MAYBE THAT'S THE WRONG PLANT 
I KEEP FORGETTING THAT WHILE THE PUBLIC SEE THE GARDEN FROM JUST THE TWO ANGLES 
THE JUDGES COME ONTO THE GARDEN AND SEE IT FROM EVERY ANGLE 
THERE'S NO HIDING PLACE 
IF WE'RE GONNA USE THIS ONE WE NEED TO TAKE THIS OFF AND THIS OFF 
I'D HAVE THOUGHT FAIRLY QUICKLY 
WELL JUST JUDICIOUS PRUNING ISN'T IT 
SO WE'RE HERE WE'RE ON SITE THIS IS CHELSEA 
UM IT'S DAY THREE OF THE BUILD 
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW QUICKLY THE TIME IS GOING IT'S FRIGHTENING

SO MAYBE SOMETIMES THINGS WORK OUT FOR THE BEST 
THE JUDGING'S ON MONDAY SO THAT'S IT BY THE TIME YOU GO HOME SUNDAY NIGHT 
I MAY NOT GET HOME ON SUNDAY I MAY STAY HERE ALL NIGHT
