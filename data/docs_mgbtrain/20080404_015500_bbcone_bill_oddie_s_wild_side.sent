TODAY CAMERAMAN JOHN IS DOWN IN THE DUMPS 
I INVESTIGATE THE TRUTH ABOUT U. F. O.'S 
AND WHAT DO YOU GET WHEN YOU CROSS A BEAR AN ELEPHANT AND A SHEEP 
A BLEEP 
THE FIRST THING I'VE TO DO IS SET CAMERAMAN JOHN AITCHISON HIS CHALLENGE 
AND THIS TIME JOHN IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET HIS HANDS A LITTLE GRUBBY 
I HAVE TO GET MY HANDS 
ON THE STEERING WHEEL 
YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS FANCIED MYSELF AS A COCKNEY CABBIE 
I EXPECT IT'S LOVELY UP THERE IN SCOTLAND WHERE YOU LIVE 
IT IS IT'S BEAUTIFUL HEY 
WILD 
UNSPOILT YEAH 
VERY LUCKY BOY JOHN 
VERY LUCKY BOY 
BUT I THINK IT'S NEVER A BAD THING TO BE REMINDED THAT NOT EVERYBODY IS SO LUCKY 
EH JOHN YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
SO THIS IS WHY JOHN 
I AM TAKING YOU TO THE EAST END OF LONDON 
SOMEWHERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
EVER BEEN HERE BEFORE JOHN 
NO 
NO NEITHER HAVE I 
BLIMEY I'M SORRY JOHN 
WHERE HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME TO IT'S NOT MY FAULT 
IT'S THE PRODUCER'S IDEA 
HE SAID COME ALONG TO YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS 
IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST RUBBISH DUMPS IN BRITAIN 
O. K. SO YOUR CHALLENGE VERY VERY SIMPLE 
FIND THE WILDLIFE 
SO LET'S LEAVE JOHN RUMMAGING THROUGH THE RUBBISH 
NOW THERE'S A LOT OF MYSTERIOUS CREATURES OUT IN OUR COUNTRYSIDE 
HERE'S A LITTLE TEASER FOR YOU 
HOW MANY SPECIES OF DEER ARE THERE LIVING IN THE WILD IN THE BRITISH ISLES 
ER OH GOSH FALLOW DEER 
FALLOW ROE DEER ROE DEER 
I KNOW THERE'S RED REINDEER 
ELKS I'D SAY ROE DEER BUT I MIGHT HAVE MADE THAT UP 
SIKA RED DEER IS IT 
FALLOW FALLOW DEER YES 
WHAT ARE THE TINY ONES 
MUNTJAC MUNTJAC NO 
VERY GOOD MUNTJAC YES I HAD IT 
I SAW A COUPLE OF STAGS THE OTHER DAY 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE BUT THEY WERE BIG UNS 
THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT IT 
THERE'S STILL ONE THAT NOBODY HAS MENTIONED 
YOU DON'T FIND THEM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT THEY ARE QUITE COMMON 
HERE IN THE WETLANDS OF EAST ANGLIA 
OH AND THAT IS A CLUE 
AND THAT IS THE DEER 
IT'S A CHINESE WATER DEER 
I'VE GOT TO SAY THE FIRST THING THAT STRUCK ME WHEN I SAW ONE OF THESE WAS 
IS THAT REALLY A DEER 
I MEAN COME ON WHAT MAKES A DEER A DEER 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU I'D SAY ANTLERS 
INSTEAD THEY'VE GOT LITTLE TUSKS 
TECHNICALLY THOSE ARE SORT OF ENLARGED TEETH THE INCISORS BUT BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT TUSKS ARE 
SO THEY'VE GOT LITTLE TUSKS 
SO IS THERE A WEE BIT OF ELEPHANT IN THERE SOMEWHERE 
OR NO SURELY NOT 
OR MORE LIKELY A LITTLE BIT OF WILD BOAR PERHAPS 
YET THE EARS ARE LIKE TEDDY BEAR EARS AREN'T THEY 
I DON'T THINK THEY EVOLVED FROM TEDDY BEARS 
ANOTHER ODD THING THE SOUNDS THEY MAKE 
I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT A RED DEER BELLOWING SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A 
BUT CHINESE WATER DEER DON'T BELLOW THEY BARK MORE LIKE A DOG 
EXCEPT WHEN THEY'RE COURTING WHEN THEY WHISTLE AND SQUEAK 
THEY ARE A BIT OF A MISHMASH AREN'T THEY 
BUT NEVERTHELESS 
I ASSURE YOU THEY ARE OFFICIALLY CLASSIFIED AS PRIMITIVE DEER 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE NAME CHINESE WATER DEER 
WELL THE WATER BIT PRETTY OBVIOUS 
THEY DO INDEED LOVE LIVING IN MARSHLANDS AND PLACES LIKE THIS 
BUT THE CHINESE BIT OBVIOUSLY NOT A NATIVE BRITISH SPECIES 
SO WHERE DO THEY COME FROM APART FROM CHINA 
WELL BACK IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY PEOPLE WOULD TRAVEL ROUND THE WORLD 
COLLECT EXOTIC SPECIES AND BRING THEM BACK TO BRITAIN 
BUT ALMOST INEVITABLY SOME OF THEM ESCAPED 
SEE THE VICTORIANS WERE EVER SO CARELESS WITH THEIR ANIMALS 
BUT MAYBE THEY GOT IT RIGHT IN THE CASE OF CHINESE WATER DEER 
WHY 
ONE THEY DON'T EAT TREES 
TWO THEY DO GRAZE GRASS 
THREE THEY ALSO CONTROL BRAMBLES SO THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB 
BUT HERE'S THE REALLY SPECIAL ONE 
IN CHINA THEY ARE A RED ALERT ENDANGERED SPECIES 
BUT HERE THEY'RE DOING VERY WELL 
SO MUCH SO 
THAT TEN PER CENT OF THE WORLD POPULATION 
OFCHINESE WATER DEER ARE BRITISH 
SO HERE IS ONE EXOTIC ESCAPEE THAT WE CAN WELCOME WITH OPEN ARMS 
LAND OF HOPE AND GLORY 
LET'S FACE IT THEY ARE RATHER ENDEARING 
I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I GOT SO FAR AND I LET MYSELF DOWN 
OH DEAR I'VE DONE IT AGAIN 
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR ME TO EXIT STAGE LEFT 
AND FOR CAMERAMAN JOHN AITCHISON TO HEAD FOR THE DUMP 
IT'S QUITE EXCITING I HAVEN'T BEEN INTO THIS SITE BEFORE 
I'M QUITE INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT'S HERE 
EVERY MORNING FIVE HUNDRED LORRIES QUEUE UP AT THIS SITE 
AND DUMP TWO THOUSAND TONNES OF WASTE MUCH OF WHICH IS EDIBLE 
IF YOU'RE A SCAVENGER THAT IS 
LOOK AT THIS 
COR BLIMEY JOHN 
YOU AREN'T EVEN AT THE GATES YET AND YOU'VE BAGGED ME A FOX 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S WAITING FOR A BUS DOESN'T IT 
HELLO 
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE 
INTERESTING LOOK AT THIS 
FOXES MUST BE SO USED TO PEOPLE COMING HERE 
WHERE I LIVE IN SCOTLAND'S VERY REMOTE 
IT'S A COUNTRYSIDE PLACE THERE'S HARDLY ANY PEOPLE THERE REALLY 
AND THERE ARE FOXES I SEE THEM OCCASIONALLY 
THEY ARE EXTREMELY WARY 
I'VE TRIED FILMING THEM BEFORE AND IT'S VERY VERY HARD 
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO CLOSE TO A WILD FOX BEFORE 
THEY SMELL MY SANDWICHES 
THAT'S MY BAG DON'T EAT IT 
FOXES ARE SO SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE 
THEY CAN EAT ALMOST ANYTHING BUT RUCKSACKS AREN'T USUALLY ON THE MENU 
THE THING ABOUT THIS THAT'S SO EXTRAORDINARY 
I'M SO CLOSE I'M SEEING DETAILS I WOULD JUST NEVER HAVE NOTICED ABOUT FOXES BEFORE 
LIKE THEY HAVE A WHISKER THAT COMES OUT HERE JUST BEHIND THE EYE 
YOU CAN SEE THEM AS INDIVIDUALS NOT JUST AS FOXES 
LOOK AT THIS VERY VERY SUBDUED FOX 
AND A VERY DOMINANT ONE 
THIS IS AN ADULT I THINK 
IT'S COME IN VERY AGGRESSIVELY TOWARDS THE OTHER 
THAT LITTLE VIXEN LOOK AT HER BEHIND COWERING AWAY 
SHE'S DUCKED INTO THE BUSHES NOW 
AND THE SAD THING IS IT'S ONLY OVER A PAIR OF OLD GLOVES THERE'S NO FOOD THERE AS FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT 
THEY MUST THINK THERE'S FOOD IN THE GLOVES I SUPPOSE 
THE TRUCKS ARE ON THEIR WAY INTO THE DUMP 
AND I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THEM TO SEE IF I CAN FIND ANY MORE SURPRISES INSIDE 
ACTUALLY I CAN'T THINK OF MANY THINGS MORE SURPRISING 
THAN A FOX WEAVING ITS WAY THROUGH A QUEUE OF JUGGERNAUTS 
ANYWAY JOHN WILL NO DOUBT ENLIGHTEN US LATER 
MEANWHILE 
ALLOW ME TO TAKE YOU ON A FLASHBACK 
WOBBLE WOBBLE WOBBLE BACK TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
IT WAS THE EARLY DAYS OF RADAR AND IT WAS ALSO THE EARLY DAYS OF U. F. O.'S 
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS 
BARELY A DAY WENT BY WHEN SOME TRAFFIC CONTROLLER DIDN'T REPORT 
MYSTERY BLIPS ON THE SCREEN 
STAR TREK THEME 
THERE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY SOMETHING UP THERE AT TEN THOUSAND FEET 
WHAT WAS IT WHAT WERE THEY 
COS THERE WAS A LOT OF THEM 
WELL TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS REFERRED TO THEM AS ANGELS 
DOUBTFUL 
OTHER PEOPLE PREFERRED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE ALIENS 
ALSO UNLIKELY 
IN FACT THE TRUTH WAS EVEN STRANGER 
IN FACT YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE THEM DURING THE SUMMER LIVING IN YOUR ROOF 
THEY'RE SWIFTS 
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH HOUSE MARTINS OR SWALLOWS 
OR INDEED ALIENS OR ANGELS 
WHAT MAKES SWIFTS SO UTTERLY UNIQUE IS THAT THEY DO JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ON THE WING 
THEY SLEEP IN THE AIR THEY FEED IN THE AIR THEY MATE IN THE AIR 
THEY DON'T STOP AND PERCH AND HAVE A LITTLE REST 
THEY FLY AND THEY FLY AND THEY FLY FOR ALMOST THE WHOLE OF THEIR LIVES 
OF COURSE THERE IS ONE THING THEY CAN'T DO UP IN MID AIR AND THAT IS NEST 
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS 
IN SIXTY ODD YEARS I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN A SWIFT'S NEST 
ALTHOUGH I KNOW PERFECTLY WELL WHERE THEY ARE 
FOR EXAMPLE I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF OXFORD 
BEHIND ME IS THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM 
UP THERE IS A TOWER 
AND IN THAT TOWER I KNOW FOR A FACT THERE ARE MANY PAIRS OF SWIFTS NESTING 
AND I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE ONE OF THOSE NESTS MYSELF 
NOW THERE IS A BLOKE IN HERE THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHOW ME ONE 
ALL I'VE GOT TO DO IS FIND HIM 
IT'S ALL RIGHT JUST BEING SILLY 
I TRACKED OUR MAN TO THE TOP OF THIS TOWER 
HIS NAME IS ROY OVERALL 
AND TO THE SWIFTS HE'S THEIR GUARDIAN ANGEL 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN STUDYING THESE PARTICULAR FORTY FIVE YEARS 
WOW RIGHT EXCITING MOMENT 
IT'S LIKE UNVEILING THE PLAQUE ISN'T IT 
THIS IS MY FIRST 
SWIFT'S NEST 
AND MY VERY FIRST BABY SWIFT IN THE NEST 
AND I SAID OUTSIDE THAT A SWIFT CAN'T ACTUALLY NEST ON THE WING 
BUT THE TRUTH IS IT COLLECTS ITS MATERIAL ON THE WING 
YES EVERYTHING IN THIS BOX IS PICKED UP IN THE AIR 
SO FROM FEATHERS TO GRASSES TOILET TISSUE 
EVEN BITS OF RUBBER FROM BURST BALLOONS 
AND CONFETTI AS WELL 
OH YEAH 
I KNOW THERE'S STILL MYSTERY ABOUT THIS THING OF SLEEPING ON THE WING ISN'T THERE 
I SUPPOSE WE THINK IN TERMS OF SLEEPING AS EIGHT HOURS A NIGHT 
I THINK FOR BIRDS AND PROBABLY FOR A LOT OF ANIMALS IT'S CAT NAPPING 
RIGHT WHERE IT'S JUST SLEEPING FOR MINUTES OR SECONDS 
IF THEY START TO FALL OUT OF THE SKY 
WELL WHAT'S IT MATTER THEY'RE UP SO HIGH JUST CARRY ON FLYING I'M FALLING 
THAT'S ASTONISHING IT REALLY IS OH HELLO 
THERE USED TO BE A SORT OF FOLKLORE 
THAT SWIFTS DIDN'T HAVE FEET OR LEGS AT ALL DIDN'T THEY 
THEY'VE GOT THEIR LATIN NAME APUS APUS WHICH LITERALLY MEANS LEGLESS 
LEGLESS BUT THEY DO HAVE LEGS 
THERE YOU ARE THERE'S A LEG TEENY WEENY 
AND FOUR TOES ALL AT THE FRONT 
SO IT CANNOT PERCH 
BUT IT CAN CLING 
ROY HAS A LICENCE TO RING THESE BIRDS 
MIND YOU IT'S NOT EASY WITH SUCH LITTLE LEGS 
THE SWIFTS I MEAN 
THERE YOU GO 
THAT IS S. E. TWO FORTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN 
IT'S NOT EXACTLY A PET NAME IS IT 
NOT REALLY NO 
THAT'S VERY CLEVER THAT HE CAN SORT OF CLOSE HIS EYES BUT NOT REALLY 
HE CAN PRESUMABLY SENSE LIGHT THROUGH THERE 
EVEN CLEVERER WHEN IT'S AN ADULT IT HAS A ROW OF BRISTLES ALONG THE FRONT OF THE EYE THERE 
TO PROTECT THE EYE IN CASE OF PASSING INSECTS BLOWING INTO ITS EYE 
LITTLE WHITE CHIN LOOK AT THAT 
BUT THAT BEAK THERE IT'S NOT DESIGNED FOR PICKING THINGS UP 
IT'S DESIGNED PURELY FOR PREENING 
O. K. WHO IS THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOURS 
IN HERE WE'VE GOT AN ADULT AND TWO VERY SMALL YOUNG 
OOH THEY ARE TINY LOOK AT THIS 
THAT IS MAGIC THAT IS REALLY MAGIC 
WHEN I SAID I WANTED TO SEE A SWIFT'S NEST 
I THINK THIS WITH THE LITTLE TINY THINGS LIKE THAT 
SO SMALL SO HELPLESS 
AND TO THINK THAT IN ABOUT FIVE TO SIX WEEKS TIME 
THEY WILL ACTUALLY HAVE TRANSFORMED THEMSELVES INTO A MIRACLE BIRD 
IF EVER THERE WAS ONE 
I AM NOT BIG ON STATISTICS BUT THESE ARE IMPRESSIVE FIGURES 
BECAUSE THAT BIRD CAN TRAVEL FIVE HUNDRED MILES IN ONE DAY 
VERY SOON IT'S GOING TO SET OFF SOUTH ON A JOURNEY OF FIVE THOUSAND MILES 
IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE READY TO BREED UNTIL IT'S TWO OR THREE YEARS OLD 
AND UNTIL THAT TIME IT MAY NEVER EVER LAND 
AND IF IT LIVES TO A RIPE OLD AGE OF SAY TEN YEARS OLD AND THAT'S ABOUT AVERAGE 
THEN IT WILL HAVE COVERED SOMETHING LIKE TWO MILLION MILES 
A MIRACLE BIRD INDEED 
HERE'S THE BEST BIT THEY'RE SO EASY TO SEE 
NOT QUITE SO EASY TO FILM MIND YOU 
THERE'S ONE GO QUICK 
IS IT TIME FOR LUNCH 
IN A MINUTE HAVE ANOTHER GO 
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT 
U. F. O.'S WEREN'T LITTLE GREEN MEN THEY WERE LITTLE BLACK BIRDS 
U. F. O.'S WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER 
AND NOW A TRIP TO THE SEASIDE 
POTTERING AROUND ON THE BEACH GAZING INTO ROCK POOLS IS A VISUAL DELIGHT 
WILDLIFE PROGRAMMES OFTEN REFER TO IT AS LOOKING INTO A SILENT WORLD 
BUT IS IT 
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT WHAT DOES A ROCK POOL SOUND LIKE 
A ROCK POOL 
WHOOSH SPLASH SPLISH SPLASH 
GLUG I THINK A NICE ECHOEY SOUND 
PLOP PLOP BUBBLING GURGLING SOUND 
WHOOSH BUBBLE BUBBLE 
WHATEVER A CRAB SOUNDS LIKE 
GRR C. H. C. H. C. H. PSST 
I GOTTA TELL YOU OH BLIMEY 
I LOVE ROCK POOLING BUT THE ONLY NOISE I ASSOCIATE WITH IT 
IS SCREAMS OF AGONY AS I SLIP ON THE SEAWEED 
AND WHACK MY ANKLES ON THE ROCKS OR MY BACK GOING AS I'M FISHING AROUND 
WHERE'S HE GONE 
HE IS WILDLIFE SOUND RECORDIST CHRIS WATSON 
A MAN WHOSE MOTTO IS EVERYTHING MAKES A SOUND 
LITHE AS A MOUNTAIN GOAT 
YOU LOOK AS THOUGH YOU'RE DOING SOME BIZARRE ELECTRONIC FISHING OR SOMETHING 
IS THIS LEGAL 
WHOA 
GIVE US A HAND 
AT THE MOMENT MUCH AS I LIKE RECORDING YOU BILL 
I'M MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN THE SOUNDS DOWN IN THIS POOL 
PUT ME IN MY PLACE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
CAN YOU SPOT A NOISY POOL IF I CAN PUT IT THAT WAY JUST BY LOOKING AT IT 
NO I THINK THE ONLY WAY IS TO DROP THESE HYDROPHONES IN AND JUST LISTEN 
HYDROPHONE THAT'S A POSH WORD FOR AN UNDERWATER MICROPHONE 
YEAH O. K. 
AM I RIGHT IN SAYING IF I SHOVE MY HEAD UNDER THE WATER I WOULDN'T HEAR WHAT THAT'S GOING TO HEAR 
NO ABSOLUTELY NOT I'M NOT GOING TO BY THE WAY 
THIS HEARS SOUND IN A MUCH PURER WAY THAN JUST TRYING TO LISTEN UNDERWATER 
ALL RIGHT SO DIP THEM IN SHALL I DO THE DIPPING 
IT'S LOVELY 
SO THAT'S THE BACKGROUND SOUND OF THAT ROCK POOL THAT'S THE AMBIENCE 
I CAN'T HELP THINKING THAT A BABY IN THE WOMB WOULD LIKE THAT 
THAT LOW DEEP SENSE IT HAS 
I THINK YOU'RE PUTTING ME INTO A TRANCE 
THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING MOVING THERE 
ON TOP OF THAT SEA SOUND CAN YOU HEAR IT'S LIKE A CLICK OR 
THAT CLICK CLICK YEAH YEAH 
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE ALIVE DOWN THERE 
SOUNDS ALMOST LIKE IT WAS CHOMPING 
WOW JAWS 
THAT'S A SHRIMP CHOMPING AWAY 
BE CAREFUL A DEADLY VAMPIRE SHRIMP 
THE THING I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THESE TINY MICROSOUNDS 
IS THAT WE CAN REALLY FOCUS IN 
AND HEAR THE SMALLEST MINUTEST SOUND 
CHRIS UNDERNEATH MY HAND HERE I JUST REALISED A LITTLE CRAB 
ALL RIGHT IT WAS HIDING 
SHUFFLING AWAY 
HE WENT I'M OFF 
PRESUMABLY ANY TIME A SMALL CREATURE GOES THROUGH THIS STUFF IT HEARS ALL THIS 
IT MUST BE LIKE WALKING THROUGH A NOISY FOREST YEAH YEAH 
A MINI AQUATIC RAINFOREST IN FACT 
JUST IMAGINE IF WE COULD HEAR ALL THIS GOING ON 
I MEAN POTTERING AROUND ROCK POOLING WOULDN'T QUITE SO PEACEFUL 
A ROCK CONCERT PERHAPS 
IT'S LIKE GAZING INTO A CRYSTAL BALL 
EXCEPT IT'S NOT BALL SHAPED AND IT'S NOT REALLY CRYSTAL EITHER 
OTHERWISE A FINE ANALOGY 
THANK YOU CHRIS 
NOW ITS TIME TO CHECK UP ON OUR VERY OWN STIG OF THE DUMP 
HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON JOHN EH 
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO CLOSE TO A WILD FOX BEFORE 
VERY NICE BUT TIME TO GET INTO THE DUMP 
WOW LOOK AT THAT 
THIS IS QUITE BREATHTAKING ACTUALLY 
IT'S ASTONISHING HOW MANY BIRDS THERE ARE IT LOOKS LIKE AN APOCALYPSE 
IT'S LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD WITH THIS DESTRUCTION AND CRUSHING 
BY THESE FIFTY TONNE TRUCKS THAT ARE MOVING AROUND 
THERE'S CLEARLY A LOT OF FOOD HERE 
I SUPPOSE WE DO THROW AWAY A LOT OF FOOD 
THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED TRUCKS A DAY TWO THOUSAND TONNES OF RUBBISH 
A LOT OF IT'S EDIBLE 
AS A RESULT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF GULLS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF STARLINGS 
THERE'S FOUR TYPES OF GULLS 
THERE ARE HERRING GULLS 
GREATER BLACK BACKS WHICH ARE HUGE COMPARED TO STARLINGS THEY LOOK LIKE GIANTS 
LESSER BLACK BACKS WHICH ARE MORE COMMON IN BRITAIN 
BECAUSE OF LANDFILLS LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY INLAND 
AND BLACK HEADED GULLS WHICH HAVE LOST THEIR BLACK HEADS BECAUSE WE'RE COMING INTO THE WINTER 
LOADS OF THOSE 
IT'S REALLY NICE 
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT GULLS QUITE SO CLOSELY FOR SUCH A LONG TIME 
I'VE COME DOWN INTO A BIT OF A HOLLOW HERE 
IT'S BRILLIANT BECAUSE I'M AT THE EYE LEVEL OF THE STARLINGS NOW 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE BIRDS LIKE THAT AT THEIR OWN EYE LEVEL 
THEY'RE ONLY ABOUT THREE INCHES HIGH 
SUCH AN UNUSUAL PERSPECTIVE 
JUST AMAZING 
THEY'VE ALL TAKEN OFF WOW 
IT'S JUST SO SPECTACULAR WHEN THEY GO OVERHEAD 
LIKE A CEILING OF BIRDS REALLY QUITE CLOSE TO MY HEAD 
THEY COME STRAIGHT BACK ROUND GOING TO THE TIP AGAIN WHERE THE FOOD IS 
WOW 
IT WAS AMAZING SEEING THOSE FOXES SO CLOSE THIS MORNING 
BUT IF ANYTHING I THINK THIS IS MORE SPECTACULAR REALLY 
I KNEW THERE'D BE BIRDS HERE BUT WHEN YOU SEE THEM THROUGH THE CAMERA LENS 
ALL THESE GRAPHIC PICTURES OF THE BIRDS AND THE MACHINES TOGETHER IT'S SPECTACULAR 
I'VE REALLY ENJOYED IT 
BILL YOU'VE GIVEN ME SOME REALLY DIFFICULT CHALLENGES THESE LAST FEW WEEKS 
BUT THIS HAS BEEN EASY 
MAKE IT SO EASY FOR YOU 
YES WELL I DID 
I KNEW YOU'D LIKE IT 
MEANWHILE IN AN ENGLISH COUNTRY GARDEN IN THE MIDDLE OF LONDON IT'S MINE ACTUALLY 
I'M FEEDING THE BIRDS 
NOW SOME PEOPLE CALL CREATURES THAT SURVIVE ON THE LEFTOVERS FROM BIRD FEEDERS ENTERPRISING 
OTHER PEOPLE CALL THEM VERMIN 
AND I CALL THEM RATTY OR INDEED RATTIES 
TO BE HONEST I WAS RATHER EXCITED WHEN I FIRST CAUGHT THEM ON CAMERA 
ALTHOUGH I DO SUSPECT MY WIFE WOULD RATHER I'D CAUGHT THEM MORE LITERALLY 
I THINK THEY'RE REALLY ENDEARING 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE JUST NIBBLING AND WASHING THEIR WHISKERS LOOK AT THAT 
I ASSUMED THERE WAS A NEST NEARBY 
AND IN LATE MAY PROOF 
BABY RATS OR RATHER BABY RATTIES 
I MEAN WHO COULD REGARD THESE LITTLE CHAPS AS VERMIN 
THEY'RE LOVELY 
UNFORTUNATELY THE BABY RATS BECAME BIGGER RATS 
AND IT WASN'T VERY LONG BEFORE THEY BEGAN TO EXERCISE THEIR JAWS 
BY GNAWING THROUGH THE WIRING TO MY GARDEN LIGHTS 
SO I THOUGHT WELL O. K. I'LL JUST PUT OUT SOME LITTLE BITS OF SPARE FLEX JUST FOR THEM 
THEY DIDN'T TOUCH IT 
THEY OBVIOUSLY ONLY ENJOYED BITING THROUGH LIVE WIRES 
WHICH LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT'S NOT THE TASTE OF RUBBER THAT RATS LIKE 
IT'S THE TINGLE OF ELECTRICITY 
AND THAT IS MY FIRST CONTRIBUTION TO RAT RESEARCH 
BY NOW THOUGH MY FAMILY WERE SAYING IT'S THE RATS OR THEM 
HARD CHOICE BUT AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT 
I GOT IN TOUCH WITH A HUMANE PEST CONTROLLER 
HE TOLD ME RATS DON'T LIKE CHANGE 
I DON'T MEAN THEY CAN'T STAND IPODS AND THAT KIND OF THING 
UNFAMILIAR OBJECTS FREAK THEM OUT 
SO I PUT A SMALL GLITTERBALL IN FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE 
AND THEY LOVED IT 
THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN HAVING A DISCO 
NEXT UNFAMILIAR OBJECT A PORCELAIN PIG 
WHICH THEY GREETED AS IF IT WAS AN HONORARY RAT 
MAYBE I WAS BEING A BIT TOO SUBTLE 
O. K. THEN HERE WE GO SEVERAL UNFAMILIAR OBJECTS 
A RABBIT A BEETLE 
A FRILLED LIZARD A FLOWERPOT MAN 
AND SEVERAL GNOMES WHICH ONE OF THEM SEEMED TO FALL IN LOVE WITH 
IT WAS LIKE A TRIP TO THEM I SUPPOSE OH MAN THIS IS WILD 
RIGHT THEN TIME FOR THE ULTIMATE DETERRENT 
FREDDIE THE SHIP'S CAT 
ALL RIGHT HE'S NOT ALIVE BUT HE'S VERY LIFELIKE 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT THEN NO HE'S NOT DEAD HE'S ASLEEP 
AND HE COULD WAKE UP AND THEN YOU RATS WILL BE IN 
WELL THE FLIES SEEM TO LIKE HIM 
SO MY SECOND CONTRIBUTION TO RAT RESEARCH 
RATS DON'T IN FACT HATE CHANGE THEY WELCOME IT 
IN FACT I'M THINKING OF BUYING THEM AN IPOD 
NEXT TIME I ATTEMPT TO LISTEN TO MY INNER TREE 
I CAN'T HEAR A THING 
LONDON IS INVADED BY A MYSTERIOUS FORM OF POND LIFE 
AND MY GARDEN IS THE SCENE OF A MURDER MYSTERY 
I WANT YOU BACK BY THE JACKSON FIVE 
WHEN I AD YOU TO MYSELF 
I DIDN'T WANT YOU AROUND 
THOSE PRETTY FACES ALWAYS MADE YA 
STAND OUT IN THE CROWD 
THEN SOMEONE PICKED YOU FROM THE BUNCH 
ONE GLANCE WAS ALL IT TOOK 
NOW IT'S MUCH TOO LATE FOR ME 
TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK 
OH DARLIN' I WAS BLIND TO LET YOU GO 
BUT NOW SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU IN HER ARMS I WANT YOU BACK 
INTRODUCING THE JACKSON FIVE
