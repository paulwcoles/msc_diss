TWO WEEKS AT MAGIC SCHOOL 
THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE WINNER 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE 
COMING UP THE SORCEREES FACE THEIR FIRST LIVE AUDIENCE 
I AM READY FOR THE BIGGEST PERFORMANCE OF MY LIFE 
AND FOUR OF THEM ARE ELIMINATED 
ONLY THE NAMES THAT I CALL OUT WILL REMAIN HERE WITH US 
DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE ANCIENT ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
A MASTER MAGICIAN IS SEARCHING FOR AN APPRENTICE 
THE KIND OF APPRENTICE THAT I'M LOOKING FOR 
SOMEBODY THAT IS DEDICATED 
SOMEBODY THAT SEEKS TO BE SKILLFUL AND AIMS FOR PERFECTION 
IT'S BEEN A LONG FIRST WEEK AT MAGIC SCHOOL 
AND THE SORCEREES HAVE BEEN ON A STEEP LEARNING CURVE 
WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT MAGIC 
BUT WITH DEDICATION AND DETERMINATION 
ALL ARE BECOMING TRUE PERFORMERS 
I FEEL FAINT 
SO I TOOK THE EGG SNAP 
TODAY THE COMPETITION TO BECOME THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE 
STEPS UP A WHOLE NEW GEAR 
IT'S SEVEN THIRTY A M. AND AS EVER MISS FORD STARTS THE DAY OFF 
BANG ON SCHEDULE WITH HER GENTLE MORNING WAKE UP 
WAKEY WAKEY BIG DAY TODAY LET'S GO 
GET UP GET DRESSED GET TIDIED GET THIS ROOM IN ORDER 
I SLEPT WELL BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN GOOD TO STILL BE ASLEEP 
GOOD MORNING WAKEY WAKEY 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT MORNING GOOD MORNING 
THE ROUTINE MIGHT BE GETTING FAMILIAR BUT THEY DON'T KNOW 
THAT TODAY IS GOING TO BE THEIR TOUGHEST DAY YET 
THEY HAVE ALL BEEN SUMMONED TO THE THEATRE 
WHERE THE CONTEST IS ABOUT TO GET SERIOUS 
AT THE END OF TODAY'S PERFORMANCE 
FOUR SORCEREES WILL BE ELIMINATED FROM THE COMPETITION 
AND SENT HOME FROM MAGIC SCHOOL 
THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS ARE THE MOST DEFINING TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
IN YOUR STAY AT THIS SCHOOL 
SO FAR THE SORCEREES HAVE ONLY EVER PERFORMED THEIR MAGIC 
IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL STAFF 
TOMORROW YOU WILL BE PERFORMING IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE 
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT IN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
YOU THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT YOUR PERFORMANCES 
YOUR CONDUCT DISCIPLINE DEDICATION AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL 
HAVING A CROWD OF FIFTY PEOPLE STUDY THEIR EVERY MOVE SHOULD FOCUS 
THEIR MINDS ON THE COMPETITION THEY ALL CAME HERE TO WIN 
ALL OF US ARE LIKE FRIENDS AND I DON'T WANT THEM TO GO 
SO I'M HAPPY THE COMPETITION'S UNDER WAY 
BUT SAD THAT PEOPLE WILL BE GOING IT'S LIKE EMOTIONS MIXED 
UNTIL NOW THE BOYS HAVE BEEN COMPETING AGAINST THE GIRLS 
BUT FROM TODAY ONWARDS IT'S EVERY SORCEREE FOR THEMSELVES 
NOW IT'S HEAD TO HEAD EVERYONE'S AGAINST EVERYONE 
NOW WE'LL GET RATED ON HOW WE'RE INDIVIDUALLY DOING 
WHICH IS BETTER BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET LET DOWN BY ANYONE ELSE 
I JUST WANT TO DO MY BEST 
AND STAY IN THE ACADEMY AND I DON'T WANT TO GO NOW 
MISS FORD IS DETERMINED THAT WHOEVER HAS TO GO LEAVES ON SCHEDULE 
I'LL GIVE YOU EACH A BAG WITH YOUR NAME ON 
YOU'RE GOING TO PACK ALL YOUR BELONGINGS IN IT 
THAT ARE IN THIS ROOM EVERYTHING THAT BELONGS TO YOU 
AND WHEN YOUR BED IS MADE 
YOU'LL PUT THIS BAG ON THE END OF IT HARVEY EVERYBODY IS PACKING UP 
MISS FORD'S PREPARATIONS HAVE HAMMERED HOME 
THAT NO ONE'S PLACE AT MAGIC SCHOOL IS GUARANTEED 
IT FEELS QUITE SCARY AND IT KIND OF MADE IT ALL A BIT REAL 
THAT ACTUALLY IT COULD BE ME 
I DON'T WANT TO BE ONE OF THEM FOUR 
SO I DON'T KNOW JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE I DO GOOD IN THE PERFORMANCE 
I UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE ALL PACKING UP 
BECAUSE IT COULD BE FOUR OF US LEAVING TODAY 
I'M QUITE UPSET ABOUT IT BUT IT HAS TO HAPPEN SO IT'S O. K. 
FOR MOST OF THE WEEK 
HARVEY BAILEY HAS PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE COMPETITION 
BUT YESTERDAY HE SAW SOME SUPER COOL STREET TRICKS 
AND CAUGHT THE MAGIC BUG 
I WANT TO TRY AND BECOME THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE 
AND I RECKON I COULD IF I TRIED BE QUITE GOOD AT MAGIC 
THE SORCERER WILL JUDGE WHO STAYS 
AND WHO GOES BASED ON THE TRAINEES' EFFORTS SO FAR 
TODAY HARVEY KNOWS HE MUST DO SOMETHING SPECIAL 
TO STAY IN THE RACE 
THE SORCEREES CAN CHOOSE ANY OF THE TRICKS THEY HAVE LEARNT SO FAR 
THERE IS A FULL DRESS REHEARSAL SO THEY CAN FINE TUNE 
THEIR ACTS AND PREPARE FOR THE TOUGHEST PERFORMANCE OF THEIR LIVES 
TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN 
AND OUT 
IMAGINE HOW YOU'LL BE LATER THIS AFTERNOON ON STAGE 
FROM NOW ON YOU SHOULD BE THINKING 
ABOUT YOUR PERFORMANCES NON STOP 
THINKING HOW YOU'LL ACT WHAT YOU'LL SAY 
SINCE YOU ARRIVED HERE YOU'VE BEEN WORKING UP TO THIS MOMENT 
EACH OF THE SORCEREES HAS THE CHANCE TO PERFECT THEIR ROUTINE 
O. K. HARVEY AWAY YOU GO INTRODUCE YOURSELF 
HELLO PRACTISE THEIR COMMAND ON STAGE 
LADIES AND GENTS SORCERER SIR I AM HERE TO PERFORM SOME MAGIC 
AND WITH LUCK BUILD CONFIDENCE WAIT I FORGOT MY NAME 
HARVEY HAS A MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB GET MY WAND DO A LITTLE DANCE 
THOMAS HEWSON HAS CAREFULLY CHOREOGRAPHED HIS ENTIRE STAGE SHOW 
GET MY WAND DO A LITTLE SPIN TAP I SHALL TURN IT INTO A REAL EGG 
CEANNE ISN'T QUITE SO FLAMBOYANT 
AND SAMMY AMMERCRAME IS STILL DEVELOPING HIS STAGE PERSONALITY 
I WONDER WHERE HE GOT THE IDEA FROM YEP YOU WERE TERRIFIC 
MR. KNIGHT HAS HIS THEORIES 
LET'S GET MEHMET 
INDIVIDUALITY IS EVERYTHING IN MAGIC BY NOW THE SORCEREES 
SHOULD HAVE ALL DEVELOPED THEIR OWN UNIQUE CHARACTER 
I'VE JUST NOTICED THAT YOU'RE IN A CAPE 
YOU'RE WEARING A CAPE YOU'RE WEARING A MASK 
YOU'RE WEARING A MASK ORIGINALLY WASN'T THIS YOUR IDEA THE CAPE WAS 
THE MASK WAS MINE THE BONNET WAS MINE AND YOU'RE HAPPY 
FOR HIM TO WEAR THE CAPE YEAH O. K. 
IT'S NOT FOR HIM TO TELL THEM WHAT TO WEAR 
THE SORCERER WILL DECIDE WHO IS AN ORIGINAL THINKER 
THOUGHT ABOUT HIS COSTUME AND THEN I THOUGHT 
HOW CAN I MAKE IT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AND HAVE MY OWN LOOK 
I'M STILL STRUGGLING TO BE MORE UNIQUE THAN HIM 
WHY DON'T YOU CUT A TRIANGLE THERE THAT'S ONE WAY OF GOING ABOUT IT 
IT MAKES IT LOOK DIFFERENT I'LL DO BLACK MARKS COMING DOWN HERE 
MEGAN BROCKLEHURST HAS REMEMBERED THERE'S A BASIC PROBLEM 
WITH THE TRICK SHE'S CHOSEN SHE'S AFRAID OF MICE 
PICKING UP MICE IS REALLY HARD 
COS THEY BITE ME AND STUFF AND IT'S SCARY 
I'LL JUST HAVE TO TRY 
TWO DAYS AGO SHE FLUNKED HER PERFORMANCE 
AS SHE COULDN'T TOUCH THE MOUSE 
CAN'T YOU LIFT IT OUT I'M SCARED 
BUT SHE IS SO DESPERATE TO STAY 
SHE HAS TAKEN ON HER MOST CHALLENGING TRICK 
TO WIN POINTS WITH THE SORCERER 
O. K. IT STINKS WHAT IS IT 
LUCKILY MEHMET CAN OFFER HER A HELPING HAND FOR NOW 
THAT ONE'S NOT COMING AT ALL 
OW IT'S GOING TO GET OUT NO IT ISN'T REALLY 
I'M NOT SCARED REALLY 
WHEN SHE'S ON STAGE SHE WILL HAVE TO CONQUER HER PHOBIA 
AND LITERALLY PULL IT OUT OF THE HAT 
CIRCLE AND A TAP AND A BLOW 
TO ME IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A. 
A QUICKLY PICK IT UP PICK IT UP 
REALLY IT WON'T HURT YOU 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN COMMAND I CAN'T PICK IT U. P. 
THEN WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THAT TRICK 
I THOUGHT I COULD 
BUT SHE CAN'T FOR MEGAN THE PET PERFORMANCE IS OVER 
IT'S BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S CRUCIAL SHOW 
I KNOW I SHOULD BE POSITIVE BUT I REALLY THINK THAT 
I'LL BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO GET VOTED OUT FIRSTLY 
SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH A LOT OF WORK STILL TO DO 
I'M HOPING THAT THE OLD SAYING BAD REHEARSAL GREAT SHOW 
IS GOING TO PROVE TRUE TODAY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A BIT CHAOTIC 
WITH JUST TWO HOURS UNTIL SHOW TIME 
THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE AHEAD IS SINKING IN FAST 
I'M REALLY REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT PERFORMING 
IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE 
IT'S SCARY BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE AUDIENCE IS LIKE 
IF THEY'RE GOING TO BOO YOU OFF STAGE OFF AND STUFF 
I'M A BIT WORRIED BECAUSE THIS MIGHT BE LIKE MY LAST DAY 
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW I'VE GOT A FEELING I'M GOING HOME 
LADIES 
TODAY'S LUNCH IS THE LAST TIME 
THE ORIGINAL FOURTEEN SORCEREES WILL EAT TOGETHER 
QUIET PLEASE 
THE SORCERER HAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO LIFT THEIR SPIRITS 
GOOD AFTERNOON SORCEREES GOOD AFTERNOON SORCERER SIR 
NOW YOU'LL ALL BE PERFORMING THIS AFTERNOON IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE 
AND THAT LIVE AUDIENCE WILL BE YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR FAMILY 
YES SORCERER I LOVE YOU 
WE WANT YOU TO SHINE FOR THEM 
WE WANT YOU TO SHINE FOR THIS SCHOOL 
AT PRESENT WE DON'T KNOW WHO WILL BE APPEARING ON THE STAGE IN WHICH ORDER 
SO IN MY HAT I HAVE FOURTEEN BALLS 
THE NUMBER THAT YOU PICK OUT OF THE HAT 
WILL BE THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU WILL APPEAR ON THE STAGE 
YOU WILL GO ON UNANNOUNCED YOU WILL ANNOUNCE YOURSELVES 
REACH INTO THE HAT TAKE OUT A NUMBER 
FOUR 
SEVEN 
THREE 
ONE OF US GIRLS IS GOING TO BE FIRST NINE 
PERFORMING FIRST SHOULD BE AN ADVANTAGE 
AFTER ALL THE AUDIENCE WILL BE SEEING THE TRICKS WITH FRESH EYES AND ENTHUSIASM 
THIRTEENTH ON THE STAGE 
BUT THE SORCEREES DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY 
TENTH ON THE STAGE 
OH NO 
SIXTH ON THE STAGE 
SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE FIRST IT'S GOING TO BE ME 
SECOND ON THE STAGE 
FIRST ON THE STAGE THAT'S A GOOD THING YEAH INNIT 
ELEVENTH ELEVENTH ON THE STAGE 
UP TO NOW REBECCA WHITELY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CONFIDENT PERFORMER 
I'M NOT REALLY A VERY BIG FAN OF THIS KIND OF FRUIT 
I WOULD MUCH RATHER PARTY LIFE AWAY 
TA DAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THAT WAS THE BEST FEELING EVER 
I'VE NEVER FELT SO ALIVE IN MY LIFE 
BUT THE PROSPECT OF PERFORMING MAGIC TO THE LIVE AUDIENCE 
HAS SERIOUSLY SHAKEN HER 
FIRST IS AWFUL 
BECAUSE EVERYONE EXPECTS 
EVERYONE'S EXPECTING YOU TO BE GOOD AND 
LOOK AT IT LIKE THIS REBECCA 
YOU'VE GOT THE BEST AUDIENCE YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE 
PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT YOU AND PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT YOU 
THAT'S WHY I'VE DONE THAT 
FOR YOUR BENEFIT 
FOR THE OTHER SORCEREES 
IT'S A GREAT RELIEF TO KNOW THAT WHATEVER THEY DO ON STAGE 
THEY'LL HAVE A SUPPORTIVE AUDIENCE 
I'M SO EXCITED COS I'VE NOT SEEN MY MUM AND DAD FOR A WEEK 
AND I'M GONNA SHOW OFF DO REALLY WELL 
AND THEY'LL BE REALLY HAPPY AND I'LL GET A CHANCE TO SAY HI TO THEM 
AND I'LL GET A CHANCE TO GIVE THEM A CUDDLE 
FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE LAND THE SORCEREES' FAMILIES HAVE GATHERED 
TO CHEER THEM ON 
BUT WHETHER OR NOT THEIR PRESENCE WILL REALLY HELP IS ANOTHER MATTER 
I THINK FRANKIE WILL PROBABLY FEEL QUITE SICK KNOWING THAT I'M HERE 
SHE WILL BE NERVOUS DEFINITELY HOPE SHE'S NOT AS NERVOUS AS ME 
I'M DREADING IT I'M SO NERVOUS IT'S RIDICULOUS 
PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW I WANT HIM HOME 
ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR AUDIENCE 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BOYS AND GIRLS OR WHATEVER 
BEFORE THEY HEAD FOR THE STAGE THE SORCERER HAS SOME FINAL WISE WORDS 
TO SETTLE HIS ANXIOUS YOUNG CHARGES 
DON'T LET THE AUDIENCE PHASE YOU 
REMEMBER THEY'RE FOR YOU NOT AGAINST YOU TAKE YOUR TIME DON'T RUSH 
DON'T LET YOUR NERVES GET AWAY WITH YOU KEEP YOUR NERVES UNDER CONTROL 
SO WHATEVER HAPPENS IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD 
SO THIS IS IT OUR SORCEREES ARE ABOUT TO STEP ON STAGE 
TO PERFORM TO SECURE THEIR PLACE HERE AT THE MAGIC SCHOOL 
AND THE TENSION BACKSTAGE IS REALLY MOUNTING 
I THINK I'M QUITE READY 
I HAVE A FEW NERVES BUT I'M READY TO GO 
I AM READY FOR THE BIGGEST PERFORMANCE OF MY LIFE 
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM MUST CONQUER THEIR NERVES 
IN TIME FOR THEIR BIG MOMENT 
GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BOYS AND GIRLS GOOD AFTERNOON 
I'M MAXIMILLIAN SOMERSET THE THIRD THE SORCERER 
WE'RE GLAD THAT YOU COULD MAKE IT TODAY 
TO COME AND ENJOY THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SORCEREES 
THEY'VE LEARNED A NUMBER OF DISCIPLINES 
WE HAVE BEEN TEACHING THEM HOW TO MAKE THINGS APPEAR 
THEY'VE ALSO LEARNT HOW TO TAKE TWO SOLID OBJECTS 
AND MAKE ONE SOLID OBJECT PENETRATE THROUGH ANOTHER SOLID OBJECT 
AND FINALLY THEY'VE ALSO LEARNT HOW TO TAKE ONE OBJECT 
AND TRANSFORM IT INTO 
MANY OBJECTS 
LEMON SORCERER AH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED DON'T MIND IF I DO 
DO ENJOY YOURSELVES THIS AFTERNOON 
AND LET'S ALLOW THE PERFORMANCES TO BEGIN 
CAN REBECCA WHITELY OVERCOME HER STAGE FRIGHT 
GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
HOW ARE WE ALL FEELING 
GREAT 
I'M TOLD THAT I SHOULD EAT FIVE PORTIONS OF FRUIT AND VEG A DAY 
AND TO BE HONEST IT GETS REALLY TEDIOUS 
MY MUM NAGGING IN MY EAR ALL THE TIME EAT YOUR GREENS 
I THINK IT'S REALLY BORING 
BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING 
IF I COULD JUST CREATE MY OWN FRUIT 
OOH 
JUST CLICK MY FINGERS AND MAKE IT APPEAR 
THANK YOU YOU'VE BEEN A WONDERFUL AUDIENCE 
EVERYONE'S SMILING AND LIKE WHEN I PRODUCED THE FRUIT 
EVERYONE WENT OOH 
IT'S JUST REALLY GOOD THEY WERE REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC 
AND IT WAS FAB I REALLY LIKED IT 
REBECCA HAS GOT THE CROWD GOING 
AND HAS SET A HIGH STANDARD SHE'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW 
HELLO THERE 
I IS SMALLDINI 
REACH FOR MY MAGIC WAND TAP 
AND WE HAVE SQUEAKY COTTON WOOL 
I WANT YOU ALL TO SAY THE MAGIC WORDS CHEESEY WHEESEY 
CHEESEY WHEESEY EASY PEASY 
I THINK I CAN SEE IT 
YES I'M RIGHT I'VE GOT A MOUSE 
THAT WAS GREAT 
OH MY GOD THAT WAS FANTASTIC 
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I THINK I PUT ON A REALLY GOOD SHOW 
THIS IS HARVEY BAILEY'S LAST CHANCE 
TO PROVE TO THE SORCERER HE HAS GOT WHAT IT TAKES 
LADIES AND GENTS SORCERER SIR 
I AM HERE TO DO SOME MAGIC OBVIOUSLY 
LET'S HOPE THIS PERFORMANCE ISN'T GOING TO BE TOO LITTLE TOO LATE 
SO IF I TIGHTLY PUT THAT IN THE PALM OF MY HAND TAP THREE TIMES 
IT'S AN EGG 
WAIT I'LL LET YOU IN ON A SECRET IT'S NOT A REAL EGG 
COS TO BE QUITE HONEST 
YOU CAN'T DO REAL MAGIC WITHOUT A WAND 
SO IF I TAKE MY WAND 
OH NO IT'S ALL GONE WRONG 
THE LAST TIME HE MESSED UP HARVEY LEFT THE STAGE IN TEARS 
O. K. THAT WASN'T MEANT TO HAPPEN 
WAVE MY WAND 
TODAY HE'S MADE THE SORCERER PROUD BECAUSE WHATEVER HAPPENS 
HE'S NOW LEARNT THAT THE SHOW MUST ALWAYS GO ON 
THAT WENT REALLY BAD BUT ACTUALLY IN SOME WAYS I'M QUITE HAPPY 
I'VE HAD FUN HERE BUT NO EVERYONE OUT THERE'S BETTER THAN ME 
BETTER ME GO THAN THEM 
GOOD EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
I AM FRANKIE OF THE GLEN THE SCOTTISH MAGICIAN 
YOU STUFF IT INTO YOUR FIST YOU BLOW AND CLICK 
IT IS AN EGG 
NOT ANY SORT OF EGG 
NOW IF I GET MY WAND I CAN TURN THIS INTO A REAL EGG 
MAYBE DO A LITTLE DANCE STEP 
I WOULD LIKE EVERYBODY TO NOW REPEAT AFTER ME TRIP TRAP 
TRIP TRAP 
I CAN RAP I CAN RAP 
GIVE IT TWO TAPS ICY BREATH AND WE HAVE AN EGG 
AND AT LEAST I HAVE MY BREAKFAST 
TO ME MY PERFORMANCE WAS ABOUT TWENTY BILLION OUT OF TEN 
BECAUSE I LOVED IT 
THERE WAS A FEW FLASHES OF THE EGG 
BUT OTHER THAN THAT I THINK I DID ALL RIGHT 
WELCOME LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BOYS AND GIRLS SORCERER SIR 
MEGAN HAS BEEN WORKING ON HER REPLACEMENT 
FOR THE MOUSE TRICK ALL AFTERNOON 
I'LL GET MY OTHER EGG 
AND HOLD MY OTHER BALLOON UP HIGH AND BAM IT'S IN 
SHE'S PERFECTED THE MAGIC 
YOU WANT TO SEE THE EGG INSIDE HERE THAT IT IS REAL DON'T YOU 
RIGHT BUT PAID POOR ATTENTION TO DETAIL 
I DON'T HAVE A PIN 
TWO SECONDS 
I NEED A PIN THERE'S ONE ON MY CHAIR 
IT'S THE KIND OF MISTAKE THAT COULD COST HER DEARLY 
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING 
I'VE GOT ONE SO HAVE I 
UNLESS SHE CAN KEEP THE AUDIENCE ENTERTAINED 
WOULD ANYONE FROM THE AUDIENCE LIKE TO COME AND POP MY LOVELY BALLOON 
FRIGHTENED ME TO DEATH 
IT WENT GOOD APART FROM ME LOSING THE PIN 
ON THE STAGE ON YOU COME 
EACH OF THE SORCEREES HAS PUT ON A PERFORMANCE TO BE PROUD OF 
AND EVERYONE HAS GIVEN THE SORCERER A GREAT DEAL TO THINK ABOUT 
OH YES 
WHAT A SHOW FABULOUS 
THANK YOU FOR COMING ONCE AGAIN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
GOD BLESS YOU AND GOOD NIGHT 
THE SORCERER MUST NOW CONSIDER WHICH INDIVIDUALS 
HAVE SHOWN THE DEDICATION AND THE DISCIPLINE IT TAKES 
TO MAKE IT THROUGH TO THE SECOND WEEK 
WHILE THEY WAIT FOR THE FINAL DECISION 
THE SORCEREES ARE BRIEFLY REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILIES 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE OUR BUDDING MAGICIANS CAN DO 
AND IN THAT ROOM RIGHT NOW ARE MISS EVANS MR. KNIGHT 
AND THE SORCERER HIMSELF DECIDING ON THEIR FATE 
EVERY TIME HE'S ON THE STAGE HE GETS BETTER AND BETTER 
SHE STILL REMEMBERS THE DETAILS 
WHEN IT COMES TO PERFORMANCES I GET NOTHING FROM HER 
SHE REALLY FED OFF THE CROWD SHE REALLY FED OFF THE AUDIENCE 
INTERESTING DRESS SENSE INTERESTING CHARACTER 
VERY SHY BUT SHE IS REALLY TRYING HARD 
AND WHEN IT COMES TO PRACTISING HE DOESN'T DO MUCH OF IT 
SHE WAS FUNNY CHEEKY 
I THINK POSSIBLY SOMETIMES THE NERVES GET THE BETTER OF HIM 
SHE DOESN'T JUMP UP AND VOLUNTEER TO GO FIRST 
I MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE A LOOSE CANON IN YOUR MIDST 
I WAS VERY PROUD OF HER TODAY THOROUGHLY UNDERWHELMING I THOUGHT 
NOT REALLY A PERFORMER NO 
SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST NOT CUT OUT TO BE MAGICIANS 
AFTER TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF TENSION 
THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE SORCEREES TO DISCOVER THEIR FATE 
THE SORCERER HAS MADE UP HIS MIND WHO'S STAYING AND WHO'S GOING 
GOOD EVENING SORCEREES GOOD EVENING SORCERER SIR 
FIRST LET ME TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONGRATULATE ALL OF YOU 
ON YOUR FABULOUS PERFORMANCES THIS EVENING 
THE JUDGEMENT I HAVE MADE AFTER MUCH DELIBERATION 
IS BASED ON THE DEDICATION THE DISCIPLINE
