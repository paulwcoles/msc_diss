THIS IS GORDON BROWN'S WORST WEEK IN POLITICS SINCE LAST WEEK 
SO THIS WEEK BROWN HAS BEEN 
IT'S GOOD HELLO PAUL I'M A BIG FAN RAVE REVIEWS RAVE REVIEWS

AND HE HAD TO SAY THIS IS GETTING EMBARRASSING 
APPARENTLY TONY WAS VERY RED FACED ABOUT IT 
HE ALSO REVEALED THAT BROWN THOUGHT MANDELSON HAD BEEN SPREADING RUMOURS THAT BROWN WAS GAY 
THAT'S NOT THE MANDELSON WE ALL KNOW IS IT ALAN 
ANY COMMENT ON THAT I THINK I MIGHT GIVE THAT ONE A MISS 
I'LL PRESS ON NO BRIAN YOU DON'T LET HIM GIVE IT A MISS 
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU REFER TO HIM AGAIN I REFER YOU IAN
