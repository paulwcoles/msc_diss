AND AFTER A ROLLER COASTER RIDE AT AUCTION THERE ARE HIGH HOPES OF A BIG FAMILY REUNION 
THAT'S BANG ON ESTIMATE FORTY YOU HAPPY WITH THAT 
YES I'M NOT TAKING THEM HOME 
THAT'S ALL WHEN OUR GOODIES GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
I'M ABOUT TO MEET TWO VERY GLAMOROUS LADIES WHO'VE CALLED IN 
THE CASH IN THE ATTIC TEAM TO HELP THEM RAISE SOME FUNDS 
FOR A VERY IMPORTANT FAMILY VISIT 
ART THERAPIST DIANA RANDALL HAS LIVED A FASCINATING LIFE 
SHE'S TRAVELLED THE WORLD EXTENSIVELY GOING WITH HER PARENTS FROM A VERY EARLY AGE 
THE TRAVEL BUG REMAINS WITH HER TO THIS DAY 
WITH THE HELP OF HER COUSIN PAT SHE HOPES TO RAISE ENOUGH MONEY 
TO EXTEND THE FAMILY GLOBE TROTTING TRADITION 
MORNING JOHN OH GOOD MORNING LORNE 
SO HOW ARE WE MEETING TODAY 
WE'RE MEETING DIANA RANDALL AND HER COUSIN PAT THEY'VE GOT PLANS FOR A RATHER SPECIAL 
FAMILY VISIT THEY WANT US TO GET INVOLVED IN SOUNDS INTERESTING SHALL WE GET ON WITH IT 
I THOUGHT PERHAPS IF I MEET THE FAMILY 
AND YOU START HAVING A LOOK ROUND ALL RIGHT COME ON WELL IT'S VERY POSH ROUND HERE 
OH HERE WE GO 
AH GOOD MORNING LADIES HI WHAT ARE YOU GOING THROUGH HERE 
WE'RE LOOKING THROUGH SOME OLD PHOTOGRAPHS AH FANTASTIC 
DIANA IT'S YOUR HOUSE ISN'T IT 
WELL ACTUALLY IT'S MY MOTHER'S PLACE AND I'VE BEEN LIVING HERE FOR SOME TIME HELPING TO CARE FOR HER 
WELL YOU'VE CALLED IN CASH IN THE ATTIC SO WHAT DO YOU WANT US FOR 
WELL MUM HAS AN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF THAT SHE'D COLLECTED OVER THE YEARS AND 
BECAUSE I MOVE ROUND A LOT I REALLY WANTED TO GET RID OF A LOT OF IT 
SO IF WE DO TAKE SOME OF THIS STUFF TO AUCTION WHAT DO YOU WANT TO USE THE MONEY FOR 
WELL I'D LOVE TO BRING MY SON SHERIDAN HIS PARTNER 
BONNIE AND THE BABY JAMES 
OVER TO SEE MUM 
SHE'S NEVER SEEN HER GREAT GRANDCHILD AND IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC 
SO HOW MUCH MONEY ARE YOU LOOKING TO RAISE THEN DIANA 
WELL I MEAN FIVE HUNDRED WOULD BE BRILLIANT AND ALSO I'D REALLY LIKE TO PERHAPS 
BUY A LITTLE PRESENT FOR JAMES FROM THE KINGS ROAD CHELSEA AND SEND THAT OVER TO AUSTRALIA BEFOREHAND 
SO PAT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY DIANA'S COUSIN HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HELPING OUT WITH THE RUMMAGE 
I DON'T MIND I LOVE IT 
IT'S BEEN VERY INTERESTING LOOKING THROUGH ALL THE PHOTOGRAPHS AND BITS AND PIECES THAT SHE HAS 
RIGHT IF WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE FIVE HUNDRED YOU NEED BOTH TOWARDS BRINGING SHERIDAN AND THE FAMILY OVER 
AND A BIT OF A SHOPPING TRIP TO BUY A PRESENT FOR BABY JAMES THEN I THINK WE'D BETTER CRACK ON 
COME ON LET'S GET STARTED O. K. 
THANKS TO HER FAMILY'S LOVE OF ART AND TRAVEL DIANA'S HOME IS LITTERED WITH INTRIGUING ITEMS 
BUT IN HER COMPACT AND BIJOU FLAT I'M CONCERNED WE WON'T FIND ENOUGH TO TAKE TO AUCTION WITH LUCK 
OUR OWN GLOBETROTTER JOHN CAMERON WILL HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO HELP 
AH JOHN 
AH HELLO LADIES HELLO AH NOW THAT LOOKS RATHER NICE 
WELL IT'S RATHER INTERESTING I THINK IT MIGHT BE A BIT OF AN OUTSIZE CREAM JUG 
BUT IT IS AN INTERESTING JUG NEVERTHELESS WHERE DID IT COME FROM 
WELL MY MOTHER TOOK IT FROM THE FAMILY HOME WHICH WAS IN SHEFFIELD 
WELL IT'S ACTUALLY REFERRED TO AS MAJOLICA IT'S A VERY DISTINCTIVE 
TYPE OF VICTORIAN POTTERY AND IT TOOK ITS NAME FROM MAIOLICA 
WHICH WAS A TIN GLAZED EARTHENWARE PRODUCED IN ITALY AND SPAIN IN THE FIFTEENTH SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES 
SADLY THERE'S NO MAKERS NAME ON THERE AND WITH MOST THINGS THESE DAYS 
THERE IS SOME ADDED VALUE WHEN YOU CAN PUT A DESIGNER'S NAME ON SOMETHING 
IT DOES HAVE A COUPLE OF CHIPS TO THE RIM HERE 
BUT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE GLAZE IT KIND OF OBSCURES THAT AND YOU DON'T NOTICE IT 
BUT ANYBODY LOOKING TO BUY THAT WOULD SEE THAT IT HAD SOME DAMAGE 
YES SURE I HADN'T NOTICED IT SO WHAT SORT OF VALUE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT AT AUCTION 
I THINK IT'S A NICE ITEM AND AT AUCTION THESE DAYS WITH TWO COLLECTORS IN THE ROOM 
YOU'LL PROBABLY GET ABOUT FIFTY SEVENTY FOR IT REALLY THAT WOULD BE AMAZING 
O. K. THAT'S A VERY GOOD START BUT WE'VE GOT SOME WAY TO GO 
SO NEVER MIND STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM I THINK WE'D BETTER GET GOING COME ON O. K. 
IT'S FASCINATING THE HISTORY AND I HAD NO IDEA IT WOULD BE WORTH THAT MUCH 
TO ME IT WAS JUST AN OLD JUG SITTING ON THE WINDOWSILL THAT I PUT FLOWERS IN SO IT WAS GREAT 
LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER VASE DIANA BUT NOT RIGHT NOW 
WE NEED TO KEEP SEARCHING IF WE'RE GOING TO REACH THE FIVE HUNDRED TARGET 
SPLITTING UP SHOULD GIVE US A BETTER CHANCE OF SUCCESS 
WE'VE AN INTERNATIONAL MISSION ON OUR HANDS 
THANKFULLY DIANA HAS COME TO THE RESCUE 
JOHN COME AND LOOK AT THIS 
OH YOU RANG M'LADY 
THAT'S A NICE THING GORGEOUS IS IT YOURS 
IT BELONGED TO MY SON BACK IN THE PROBABLY SEVENTIES 
WELL THAT WOULD FIT PERFECTLY WERE YOU A FAN OF THUNDERBIRDS 
I REMEMBER THEM YES THEY WERE PRETTY FUN 
JEFF TRACY RETIRED ASTRONAUT AND HIS FIVE SONS 
LADY PENELOPE 
THERE WE ARE BRILLIANT THIS IS FAB AS YOU CAN SEE 
IT'S A NICE THING IT'S IN DECENT CONDITION 
ON THE BOTTOM WE CAN SEE IT'S DINKY TOYS YES GOOD OLD DINKY 
THE ONE THING A COLLECTOR WILL DO IN AUCTION ROOMS 
IS LOOK AT THE PAINTWORK TO SEE IF IT'S BEEN TOUCHED UP AT ALL H. M. M. 
THAT LOOKS PERFECT TO ME IT'S GOT ALL THE BITS AND PIECES THERE 
IS THIS SOMETHING YOU'D LET US PUT INTO AUCTION YES IT CAN GO TO AUCTION 
WELL IN THIS CONDITION I'VE SEEN THEM MAKE ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY BEFORE SO WOULD THAT BE ACCEPTABLE 
THAT'D BE GREAT WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO YES 
COME ON LET'S SEE WHAT THE OTHERS ARE DOING HOPEFULLY 
WE'LL GET A FAB RESULT ON AUCTION DAY BUT WE'RE STILL A LONG WAY FROM OUR TARGET 
MAYBE THIS SMART FIELD COMPASS WITH HINGED SIGHTING 
AND IN A LEATHER HIDE CASE WILL GIVE US ANOTHER FIFTY TO SEVENTY 
IF WE WANT DIANA'S SON AND FAMILY TO SEE THE GLAMOUR OF THE CITY 
WE NEED THIS PLUSH PAD TO FURNISH US WITH MANY MORE COLOURFUL GOODS 
I THINK MY NEXT FIND COULD DO JUST THAT JOHN DIANA 
I THINK I'VE FOUND A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL COME AND LOOK 
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT FROM THEN DIANA 
WELL MY MOTHER GOT IT IN THE BAKEWELL AREA IN THE FIFTIES I THINK 
RIGHT THAT MAKES SENSE IT HAS THAT FIFTIES LOOK ABOUT IT DOESN'T IT 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT JOHN 
WELL I'D SAY GOOD HEAVENS I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT 
THE EFFECT OF THE LIGHT DOES REMIND ME VERY LOOSELY I MIGHT ADD 
OF TIFFANY GLASS BACK OF THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY LATE VICTORIAN PERIOD 
IT'S BEEN PUT TOGETHER IN A SIMILAR WAY USING KIND OF LEAD CELLS 
THEY'VE BEEN FIXED INTO POSITION YOU CAN SEE THE LEADWORK HERE 
NOW IN TERMS OF DATE YOU SAID THE FIFTIES 
I THINK POSSIBLY LATER THAN THAT AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT DECORATION 
IN THE HOME AROUND THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES YOU SAW A LOT OF THAT KIND OF 
QUARRIED STONE LOOK AROUND WITH MOCK FIREPLACES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
THAT WAS A FASHION AND A CRAZE AFTER ALL 
SO IT KIND OF ECHOES THAT STYLE TO ME WHAT SORT OF VALUE WOULD YOU PUT ON IT 
I WOULD SUGGEST A GUESTIMATE OF ABOUT SIXTY TO EIGHTY SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
RIGHT SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT VALUATION DIANA 
I'M NOT SURE BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF MUM'S FAVOURITE ITEMS SHE REALLY LOVED IT SO I'M REALLY NOT SURE 
O. K. IN THAT CASE WE'LL JUST WAIT UNTIL THE DAY OF THE AUCTION 
AND SEE WHETHER IT TURNS UP BUT IF WE CAN'T COUNT ON THAT 
WE NEED TO FIND SOME OTHER THINGS SO SHALL WE CRACK ON FOLLOW ME 
I'M VERY FOND OF THE LAMP BECAUSE IT MEANT SUCH A LOT TO MUM 
AND SO I'M NOT SURE WHETHER I'D WANT TO PART WITH IT OR NOT 
I'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT 
DIANA'S ATTACHMENT IS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT IF WE WANT TO SCOOP THAT FIVE HUNDRED 
WE NEED TO TRACK DOWN COLLECTABLES WITH A LITTLE LESS SENTIMENTAL VALUE 
JOHN THINKS THIS STYLISH GRAINED LEATHER PICTURE FRAME 
THAT OPENS TO REVEAL AN OPAL MATT GILT MOUNT 
COULD ADD ANOTHER FIFTY TO SEVENTY TO OUR FUND 
WHILE DIANA IS HOPING THIS VICTORIAN PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM 
WILL MAKE US SIXTY TO SEVENTY NO STRANGER TO STYLE HERSELF 
DIANA AND I HEAD DOWN TO THE KINGS ROAD TO SOAK UP THE AMBIANCE 
AND FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HER COSMOPOLITAN LIFESTYLE 
YOUR CONNECTION HERE GOES BACK QUITE A WAY DOESN'T IT YOU HAD SOME SORT OF CONNECTION IN THE SIXTIES 
WELL YES I USED TO WORK IN A BOUTIQUE ON THE KINGS ROAD 
AND THAT WAS A REALLY COLOURFUL FLOWER POWER TIME THERE WAS LOTS AND LOTS GOING ON 
KINGS ROAD WAS AN AMAZING PLACE 
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TRAVELLING BECAUSE THAT'S SORT OF IN THE BLOOD ISN'T IT 
WELL MY GRANDFATHER TRAVELLED A LOT HE WAS A SCHOLAR AND HE TRAVELLED ALL OVER THE PLACE 
MY MOTHER WAS CALLED PETRA BECAUSE HE'D TRAVELLED TO THAT CITY IN JORDAN AND MUM CERTAINLY 
FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS SHE WAS ALWAYS AN ADVENTURER AND A TRAVELLER 
SHE WAS IN THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR AT THE BEGINNING WORKED ON THE RIVIERA AND PLACES LIKE THAT 
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL WITH THE FACT THAT YOUR SON'S THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD YES IT'S VERY PAINFUL 
IT'S VERY SAD YOU KNOW 
I MISS THEM LOTS IT WOULD BE LOVELY IF THEY WERE 
LIVING IN THE SAME CITY YOU KNOW 
SO HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS WHOLE TRIP FOR THEM TO COME OVER HERE 
IT'S A DREAM IN A WAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE I REALLY WANT MUM TO SEE HER GREAT GRANDSON 
IT'D BE A WONDERFUL THING I'D LOVE THAT TO HAPPEN 
WELL I COULD SIT HERE ALL DAY BUT WE'D BETTER GET BACK TO THE FLAT 
WHERE PAT AND JOHN HAVE ALREADY GOT TO GRIPS WITH THE RUMMAGE 
IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE DIANA FINDS THIS STUNNING SILVER PLATED DRESSING TABLE SET 
HOWEVER WITH A PRICE TAG OF THIRTY TO FORTY 
WILL IT BE OUR CROWNING GLORY AT AUCTION 
DIANA'S HOME HAS OFFERED UP SOME SPLENDID ARRAY OF OVERSEAS DELIGHTS AND JOHN'S INTEREST IN FINE ART 
HAS DRAWN HIM TO THE NEXT FIND OF THE DAY 
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS BEFORE 
I BELIEVE IT WAS BROUGHT BACK BY MY GRANDFATHER FROM BURMA 
THE PROCESS OF LACQUERING ITEMS ORIGINATED IN CHINA IT'S BEEN AROUND SINCE ABOUT THE HAN DYNASTY 
FOURTH CENTURY AD SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND I GUESS THE FIRST LACQUER OBJECTS 
WOULD HAVE MADE THEIR WAY INTO EUROPE AFTER THE ADVENTURES OF MARCO POLO 
IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE EUROPEANS WERE PRIZING LACQUER AND THIS KIND OF UNIQUE PLASTICKY SHINE THAT IT HAS 
THE ACTUAL BOX ITSELF IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE THING BUT IT'S A NICE THING 
IT DOES HAVE A BIT OF WEAR TO SOME OF THE GILDING ON THE TOP OF THE COVER AND THERE'S 
A LITTLE BIT OF DAMAGE TO THE LID INSIDE BUT NEVERTHELESS I THINK TO A COLLECTOR OF LACQUER 
OR TO A COLLECTOR OF PRETTY BOXES THIS WOULD BE A FAIRLY DESIRABLE OBJECT 
AT AUCTION I THINK WE'D HOPE FOR ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY FOR IT 
DO YOU THINK DIANA WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THAT I THINK SHE'LL BE DELIGHTED 
WELL WE'VE NO TIME TO WASTE LET'S GO AND SEE WHAT THEY'VE FOUND 
I THOUGHT AN EMPTY BOX WITH A BIT OF DAMAGE ON THE TOP THEN IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH ANYTHING BUT 
IF IT FETCHES THAT AT AUCTION THAT'LL BE GREAT 
WE'VE COVERED EVERY SQUARE INCH OF THIS FLAT BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO REACH OUR FIVE HUNDRED TARGET 
WE NEED TO RETRACE OUR STEPS 
SECOND TIME AROUND I FIND THIS BEAUTIFUL NEST OF TABLES 
EACH WITH AN INTRICATE CARVED FRIEZE WHICH JOHN VALUES AT FORTY TO FIFTY 
THEN A FANTASTIC PAIR OF DARK BLUE CABIN TRUNKS WITH BRASS FITTINGS 
AND LEATHER HANDLES THAT'LL SOON BE BACK ON THEIR TRAVELS AGAIN 
BUT IF WE'RE TO GET DIANA'S FAMILY OVER FROM AUSTRALIA WE NEED TO PULL OUT A MASTERPIECE 
DIANA CAN I TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS PAINTING FOR A MINUTE 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT 
WELL MY MOTHER BOUGHT IT SOME TIME IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN SHE WAS WORKING AT 
EITHER THE KENSINGTON HYPERMARKET OR THE CHELSEA ANTIQUE MARKET 
IT'S A SHAME IT ISN'T SIGNED I CAN'T SEE A SIGNATURE ANYWHERE HAVE YOU HAD A LOOK 
I COULDN'T SEE ONE EITHER NO 
LOOKING AT PORTRAITURE VERY PRETTY LADIES ARE VERY COMMERCIAL 
MUCH BETTER THAN UGLY OLD MEN BUT I THINK WE PROBABLY HAVE THE NEXT BEST THING 
A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN THAT I THINK WOULD HAVE 
MUCH CROSSOVER APPEAL IN THE AUCTION HOUSE 
WE OUGHT TO BE HOPING FOR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND WHO KNOWS 
A COUPLE OF DETERMINED YOUNG LADIES IN THE ROOM WE MIGHT SEE A BIDDING BATTLE SO HOW DOES THAT SOUND 
I'D BE VERY HAPPY YES 
LET'S HOPE HE DOES WELL YES 
MORE GOOD NEWS MY 
MY MY MY WHAT A HANDSOME FELLA FLATTERY'LL GET YOU EVERYWHERE LORNE 
YOU WANT TO RAISE FIVE HUNDRED AT LEAST SO THAT WOULD BE A CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS SHERIDAN AND THE FAMILY 
COMING OVER OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE LAMP'S GOING TO APPEAR OR NOT AT AUCTION 
WELL THE VALUATION OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO AUCTION COMES TO EXACTLY FIVE HUNDRED 
WOW THAT'S AMAZING BUT IF YOU DO CHOOSE TO BRING THE LAMP THAT ADDS ANOTHER SIXTY SO IT'LL BE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY 
GIVING YOU A BIT MORE ROOM TO MANOEUVRE BUT IT'S YOUR DECISION 
WELL THE NEXT STOP WILL BE MEETING UP AT THE AUCTION ROOM WHERE EVERYTHING WILL BE ON DISPLAY 
READY TO BE SOLD 
WE'VE SPENT A GREAT DAY AT DIANA'S LOVELY WEST LONDON FLAT 
AND FOUND A WEALTH OF GOODIES FROM ALL OVER THE GLOBE 
AMONG THE ITEMS HEADING FOR AUCTION ARE 
THE SIMPLY FAB THUNDERBIRDS CAR 
THAT BELONGED TO DIANA'S SON SHERIDAN 
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY MAJOLICA JUG THAT HAS SOME SLIGHT DAMAGE 
BUT COULD STILL RAISE FIFTY TO SEVENTY AT AUCTION 
THE STRIKING PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN 
THAT DIANA'S MOTHER FOUND IN AN ANTIQUE MARKET IN CHELSEA 
AND THE STAINED GLASS LAMP WHICH COULD BRING IN AS MUCH AS EIGHTY 
IF DIANA CAN BRING HERSELF TO PART WITH IT 
STILL TO COME ON CASH IN THE ATTIC 
WHEN WE GET TO AUCTION A FEW THINGS GO TO PLAN 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
BUT NOT EVERYTHING TURNS OUT AS WE EXPECTED 
OH THAT'S A SHAME THAT IS A SHAME 
FIND OUT IF WE CAN BRING THIS FAMILY CLOSER TOGETHER WHEN THE FINAL HAMMER FALLS 
NOW IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS SINCE WE HAD A GOOD LOOK AROUND DIANA AND PAT'S HOME 
AND WE BROUGHT THE ANTIQUES AND COLLECTABLES WE FOUND TO CHISWICK AUCTION ROOMS IN WEST LONDON 
NOW REMEMBER DIANA'S LOOKING TO RAISE AROUND FIVE HUNDRED TOWARDS THE COST OF BRINGING OVER HER SON 
HIS PARTNER AND ALSO THEIR NEW BABY FROM AUSTRALIA AND THAT OF COURSE WILL MEAN IT'S THE FIRST TIME 
THE BABY HAS MET GREAT GRANDMA SO LET'S HOPE THAT TODAY THEY MAKE THE MONEY THEY NEED 
SO THEY ALSO GET A BIT EXTRA FOR A SHOPPING TRIP DOWN THE KINGS ROAD 
THE DOORS ARE OPEN AND THE AUCTION ROOM IS FILLING UP RAPIDLY 
WITH EXPERTS AND ENTHUSIASTS ALIKE INSPECTING THE ITEMS UP FOR GRABS 
RACING TODAY OH AND JOHN CAMERON IS STANDING NEARBY TOO 
MORNING JOHN AH GOOD MORNING LORNE FRESH AS THE DAY IT WAS PAINTED JUST LIKE YOUR GOOD SELF 
THANK YOU FOR SAYING SO HE CERTAINLY IS AS HANDSOME AS I REMEMBER HIM 
EVEN IN THIS LIGHT 
HE LOOKS QUITE STRIKING DOESN'T HE 
WE'VE GOT THE OTHER EXTREME LADY PENELOPE'S CAR 
AND HER FAITHFUL CHAUFFEUR PARKER IT SHOULD DO O. K. OF COURSE 
ONE THING WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S HERE OR NOT IS THAT LAMP HAVE YOU SPOTTED IT 
IT'D BE PRETTY HARD TO MISS I HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT AND I HAVEN'T SEEN IT HERE TODAY 
SO I DON'T THINK THEY'VE BROUGHT THAT I KNOW THAT THEY'RE HERE I SPOTTED THEM IN THE FOYER 
SO SHALL WE FIND OUT WHETHER IT'S HERE OR NOT COME ON DIANA HAS BROUGHT AN ASSORTMENT 
OF COLLECTABLES WITH HER TODAY FROM THE FAMILY'S WORLDWIDE TRAVELS 
BUT I WONDER WHETHER THE BIDDERS WILL BE INTERESTED IN OUR GLOBAL MARKET GOODS 
I FIND DIANA AND PAT CHECKING OUT THE MARKET TOO 
AH GOOD MORNING LADIES 
GOOD MORNING LADIES HOW ARE YOU 
FINE APPREHENSIVE NERVOUS 
OH REALLY WHY'S THAT 
WELL I WANT TO OBVIOUSLY RAISE THE MONEY TO BRING THE FAMILY OVER 
I ALSO FELT A BIT SENTIMENTAL ABOUT SEEING THE ITEMS NOW THERE IS SOMETHING WE DID WANT TO KNOW 
WHETHER YOU'VE BROUGHT THAT LAMP OR NOT 
WELL I SORT OF THOUGHT BECAUSE MUM REALLY LOVED THE LAMP 
I'D KEEP THAT FORTUNATELY THAT DOESN'T MAKE TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE AS THE VALUATION OF EVERYTHING 
EXCLUDING THAT CAME TO FIVE HUNDRED WHICH IS THE MONEY THAT YOU WANT ISN'T IT 
WELL THE AUCTION IS GOING TO START FAIRLY SHORTLY SO I THINK THE BEST IDEA IS TO 
FIND A LOVELY ARMCHAIR SOMEWHERE THAT WE CAN GO AND WAIT FOR THE AUCTION TO START COME ON 
REMEMBER THAT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN BUYING OR SELLING AT AUCTION 
YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY COMMISSION VAT AND POSSIBLY OTHER CHARGES 
YOUR LOCAL AUCTION HOUSE CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH MORE INFORMATION
