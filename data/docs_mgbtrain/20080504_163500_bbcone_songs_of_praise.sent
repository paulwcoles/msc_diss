BOTH TOTALLY DIFFERENT BUT BOTH TOTALLY WONDERFUL 
ROLL UP 
FOR OUR SONGS OF PRAISE 
WE'VE COME TO THE METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL OF CHRIST THE KING 
IT'S ONE OF THE CITY'S MOST FAMOUS LANDMARKS 
OUR FIRST HYMN WAS COMPOSED SPECIALLY FOR THIS CATHEDRAL 
THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT IS KEPT IN THE MUSIC ARCHIVE 
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S BECOME QUITE AN ANTHEM IT'S HAIL REDEEMER KING DIVINE 
NOW EVEN I RECOGNISE THAT PLACE 
THE PHILHARMONIC HALL I'VE PERFORMED THERE MANY TIMES 
MUSIC IS SO IMPORTANT TO LIVERPOOL ISN'T IT OH YES IT'S PART OF OUR HERITAGE PART OF OUR CULTURE 
THE VERY FIRST MUSIC WERE THE SAILORS COMING IN THE SEA SHANTIES 
IN FACT WE'RE HAVING A SEA SHANTY FESTIVAL 
WE HAVE THE MOST NUMBER ONE HITS 
AND ONE OF THE FIRST WAS LITA ROZA 
IT WAS HOW MUCH IS THAT DOGGY IN THE WINDOW 
THE ONE WITH THE WAGGLY TAIL 
SO HOW MUCH DID THE BEATLES PUT LIVERPOOL ON THE MAP 
QUITE A LOT WE WERE ON THE MAP FOR OTHER THINGS BUT THE BEATLES REALLY BROUGHT IT TO A WIDER AUDIENCE 
THERE ARE STILL LOTS OF PLACES AROUND THE CITY 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE BEATLES 
CAPTURING THEM ALL HAS GIVEN ONE LOCAL MAN A NEW LEASE OF LIFE 
HEY DAVID HOW ARE YOU HEY ALED NICE TO MEET YOU YOU TOO 
WELL THIS IS THE ALBERT DOCK THIS IS THE BEATLES STORY 
BUT I'M TAKING YOU TO MY FAVOURITE BEATLES PLACE CASBAH COFFEE CLUB 
READY FANTASTIC GO FOR IT 
THERE'S A PLACE THERE'S A PLACE 
YOU DON'T EXPECT TO SEE A ROCK'N'ROLL CLUB IN SUCH A RESIDENTIAL AREA DO YOU 
YOU DON'T DO YOU COME ON IN 
IT'S INCREDIBLE PETE BEST WAS THE BEATLES' FIRST DRUMMER 
HIS MUM MONA HAD THE IDEA FOR A ROCK'N'ROLL CLUB IN THE BASEMENT OF HER HOUSE 
YOU'VE GOT A CEILING PAINTED BY JOHN LENNON 
A CEILING PAINTED BY PAUL MCCARTNEY 
WE'VE JUST REOPENED THE PLACE AS A TOURIST ATTRACTION 
SO NOW YOU CAN COME AND VISIT THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE BEATLES 
LOVE LOVE ME DO 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE BEATLES PERFORMED JUST THERE 
JUST THERE TOUCHING DISTANCE IT'S AN INCREDIBLE PLACE 
YOU GET A REAL BUZZ FROM BEING HERE 
SO PLEA EA EA EASE 
LOVE ME DO 
WHEN DID YOUR INTEREST OR EVEN OBSESSION WITH THE BEATLES START 
ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO I HAD TO GIVE UP WORK THROUGH ILLNESS 
AT THIRTY FIVE MY DOCTOR SAID 
YOU'RE PROBABLY NEVER GOING TO WORK AGAIN AND THAT WAS HARD 
WITH A WIFE AND THREE YOUNG CHILDREN AND HE SAID 
THE CONDITION I'VE GOT IS FIBROMYALGIA 
WHICH IS LIKE AN INFLAMMATION CHRONIC PAIN IN EVERY MUSCLE AND JOINT IN YOUR BODY 
IT GIVES YOU FATIGUE RESTLESS SLEEP 
FORGETFULNESS I THINK 
SO HE SAID THE MOST IMPORTANT THING MENTALLY DO SOMETHING TO KEEP YOUR BRAIN GOING 
WHAT DO YOU LIKE DOING ONE OF MY HOBBIES HAS ALWAYS BEEN PHOTOGRAPHY 
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BEATLES FAN 
AND SO I STARTED READING A BOOK 
ABOUT THE BEATLES IN LIVERPOOL 
PENNY LANE THERE IS A BARBER SHOWING PHOTOGRAPHS 
I DECIDED THAT WITH A LOT OF THE BOOKS I WAS READING 
THEY WERE WRITING ABOUT LIVERPOOL AND GETTING IT WRONG 
SO I THOUGHT I WANT TO DO A BOOK JUST ABOUT THE BEATLES AND LIVERPOOL 
SO IT TRACES THEIR CHILDHOOD TO THE FORMATION OF THE BAND 
JOHN WAS IN THE CHURCH CHOIR STUART SUTCLIFFE AND RINGO SANG IN THE CHURCH CHOIR 
SO DID PAUL PAUL SANG 
IN SAINT BARNABAS CHURCH RIGHT ON THE PENNY LANE ROUNDABOUT 
IT WAS THE CHURCH FETE SIXTH JULY NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
WHEN JOHN AND PAUL FIRST MET 
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S QUITE UNUSUAL 
NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN CHURCH EVENT ROCK'N'ROLL MUSIC QUITE BRAVE BY THE CHURCH AT THE TIME 
AND IT'S NICE WHEN YOU START DIGGING INTO SOME OF THE SONGS 
THE MEANINGS BEHIND THE WAY THEY WERE WRITTEN 
ONE PARTICULAR PAUL MCCARTNEY SONG LET IT BE 
WHICH IS THE TRANSLATION OF AMEN 
THAT WE USE AFTER PRAYERS 
AND PAUL WAS PUTTING IN YOU COULD CALL IT A SEMI RELIGIOUS IDEA 
WITH MOTHER MARY COMES TO ME 
WHICH OF COURSE COULD BE MARY THE MOTHER OF JESUS BUT ALSO HIS MUM WAS MARY 
AND HE LIKED THAT IDEA OF JUST TEASING PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE LISTENING TO IT 
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE IT WAS A SPIRITUAL THING NOT JUST A FACT FINDING MISSION YEAH 
AS WELL AS KEEPING THE MIND OCCUPIED YOU'VE GOT TO BE POSITIVE 
COS MY FAITH HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRONG AND I THINK REALLY 
MY FAITH HAS HELPED ME UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH 
I THINK THERE'S HOPE IN THERE AS WELL 
COS MY HOPE IS TO GET TO HEAVEN A PERFECT BODY'S COMING WHICH IS PAIN FREE 
AND WORKS THAT'LL DO ME SO THAT REALLY KEEPS ME GOING 
WHEN YOU'RE DOWN AND TROUBLED 
AND YOU NEED A HELPING HAND 
AND NOTHING 
NOTHING IS GOING RIGHT 
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND THINK OF ME 
AND SOON I WILL BE THERE 
TO BRIGHTEN UP 
EVEN THE DARKEST NIGHTS 
YOU JUST CALL OUT MY NAME 
AND YOU KNOW WHEREVER I AM 
I'LL COME RUNNING 
TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
WINTER SPRING SUMMER OR FALL 
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS CALL 
AND I'LL BE THERE YES I WILL 
YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND 
I'M SURE IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND 
WHEN PEOPLE CAN BE SO COLD 
THEY'LL HURT YOU YES AND DESERT YOU 
THEY'LL TAKE YOUR SOUL IF YOU LET THEM 
SO DON'T YOU LET THEM 
YOU JUST CALL OUT MY NAME 
AND YOU KNOW WHEREVER I AM 
I'LL COME RUNNING 
TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
WINTER SPRING SUMMER OR FALL 
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS CALL 
AND I'LL BE THERE YES I WILL 
YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND 
YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND 
YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND 
YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND 
YOU HAVE A FRIEND 
LIVERPOOL IS ALSO IT'S FAIR TO SAY A CITY OF FAITH ISN'T IT 
YES IT IS WE HAVE TWO CATHEDRALS JOINED BY A STREET CALLED HOPE 
THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY PUT IN THEIR MONEY I REMEMBER AS A CHILD BRINGING ME SIXPENCE 
TO BUILD THE CATHEDRAL 
PEOPLE HAVE PUT THEMSELVES OUT AND PROVIDED THE MONEY TO BUILD THESE MAGNIFICENT CATHEDRALS 
I CAUGHT UP WITH PAUL CROSSEY AT THE ANGLICAN CATHEDRAL 
IT'S JUST SUCH A VAST SPACE ISN'T IT 
WE'VE COME INTO ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHURCHES BIGGEST PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE WHOLE WORLD IN THE WORLD 
YES YES IT REALLY IS HUGE 
THE ARCHITECT GILES GILBERT SCOTT SAID 
THE PILLARS MAY BE FINE BUT IT'S REALLY THE SPACES THAT WE LOOK AT 
IN THIS BUILDING 
AND THEN THERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO PUT THEIR INITIALS ON THE WALL 
E. AND P. ELIZABETH AND PHILIP 
NINETEEN FORTY NINE THEY CAME ON A VISIT 
ACTUALLY RIGHT AT THE CENTRE OF THE CATHEDRAL THE MIDPOINT 
THIS TOWER WAS TOPPED OFF IN THE EARLY NINETEEN FORTIES 
DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
THE KING GEORGE THE SIXTH CAME ON A VISIT 
AND HE SAID TO THE STAFF THAT WERE STILL HERE 
YOU MUST KEEP GOING WHATEVER YOU DO YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WORK VERY RAPIDLY 
BUT DO KEEP GOING AND THAT WAS A WONDERFUL ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE PEOPLE 
YES WHAT WE'RE ABOUT IS RIGHT A GREAT STATEMENT OF FAITH 
SO BEFORE WE GO INTO THE METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL I DIDN'T REALISE THAT FROM HERE 
YOU CAN SEE THE ANGLICAN ONE AS WELL THAT'S JUST VERY CONVENIENTLY PLACED 
LIVERPOOL IS VERY FORTUNATE WE'VE GOT TWO TWENTIETH CENTURY CATHEDRALS 
BUT THEY ARE PURPOSE BUILT AS CATHEDRALS NOT RECYCLED MONASTERIES 
THEY ARE VERY MUCH NOW PART OF THE LIVERPOOL LANDSCAPE 
IT COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT TO THE ANGLICAN CATHEDRAL COULD IT NO THIS ONE'S VERY DIFFERENT 
WE DON'T ASK WHETHER PEOPLE ARE CHRISTIANS OR BELONG TO ANY PARTICULAR FAITH 
A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING IN ARE LOOKING FOR FAITH HAVE NO FAITH 
THEY ARE ALL VERY WELCOME BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT CHRIST SAID TO PEOPLE 
WHEN PEOPLE CAME AND SPOKE TO HIM HE WELCOMED THEM 
TELL ME A BIT ABOUT THIS STRUCTURE ABOVE THE ALTAR THEN 
IT LOOKS A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE IT CHALLENGES PEOPLE TO THINK WHAT CAN WE MAKE OF THIS 
THIS CATHEDRAL DEDICATED TO CHRIST THE KING 
AND KINGS HAVE A CROWN TO SHOW THEIR STATUS 
AND I SEE THIS AS A CROWN OF THORNS IF YOU GO EVEN HIGHER 
WHAT REALLY DOES GRAB THE ATTENTION 
IS THE DIFFERENT COLOURS IN THE GLASS YES 
THE COLOURS OF THE SPECTRUM THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW 
BUT SET IN AMONG THE COLOURS 
YOU HAVE THESE THREE PATCHES OF CLEAR LIGHT THE THREE IN ONE 
THE TRINITY 
THE LANTERN WAS MEANT AS A BEACON 
CHRIST SAID HE WAS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD 
AT NIGHT THIS IS FLOODLIT 
FROM THE INSIDE AND IT SHINES OUT 
MARIE SPORT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE OF LIVERPOOL ISN'T IT YES VERY 
I AM SEEING AHEAD OF ME NOW EVERTON 
THE PEOPLE'S CLUB 
OH YES AND WE HAVE TWO EXCELLENT FOOTBALL TEAMS EVERTON AND EVERTON RESERVES 
I BELIEVE THERE'S A RED ONE AS WELL I THINK THAT'S CALLED LIVERPOOL 
AS AN ARSENAL FAN IT PAINS ME TO SAY IT BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE 
LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB IS A PLACE OF PILGRIMAGE 
BILL SHANKLY IS STILL WORSHIPPED 
WHEN YOU WALK 
THROUGH A STORM 
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE BLUE IN THE LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB MUSEUM WELL NO 
PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW THE ORIGINS OF LIVERPOOL AND EVERTON FOOTBALL CLUB 
MIGHT BE A BIT SURPRISED BUT THE REASON IS 
WE ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE SAME PLACE A CHURCH CALLED SAINT DOMINGO'S 
ON SUNDAYS THEY SET UP A LITTLE FOOTBALL TEAM 
IT WAS A BIG MOVE IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTIES TO TRY TO GET THE YOUTHS TO DO HEALTHY EXERCISE 
SO THEY SET UP A CHURCH TEAM 
IT WAS SPONSORED BY A MAN CALLED JOHN HOULDING 
AND HE WANTED TO CREATE A FOOTBALL CLUB 
SO HE CONVERTED SAINT DOMINGO'S SUNDAY SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM 
INTO EVERTON FOOTBALL CLUB 
THEY PLAYED A NUMBER OF PLACES BUT LARGELY AROUND HERE CREATED ANFIELD AND WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL 
WELL EVERTON F. C. AS IT WAS CALLED THEN 
THIS STADIUM ANFIELD AND THE PLAYING KIT 
AND HE RENAMED IT LIVERPOOL 
AND WE PLAYED FOR FOUR YEARS WEARING BLUE AND WHITE 
IF YOU TAKE ANFIELD AND ITS SUPPORTERS 
IT'S A GREAT COMING TOGETHER OF PEOPLE A SHARED EXPERIENCE 
AND PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF LIVERPOOL F. C. OUR SUPPORTERS ARE FAMOUS FOR BELIEF 
THEY BELIEVE THAT IF YOU WORK TOGETHER AND YOU THINK TOGETHER 
FOOTBALL AND RELIGION ARE CLOSELY ENTWINED 
PARTICULARLY IN THIS CITY 
AND YOU WILL OFTEN FIND PEOPLE USING RELIGIOUS IMAGERY 
ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK IS PARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE 
IS WHEN LIVERPOOL'S FANS MAKE BANNERS AND WE'RE FAMOUS FOR THEM 
THEY'RE ALWAYS ABOUT BONDING ABOUT BELIEF AND ABOUT HOPE 
AND I THINK THAT'S QUITE INSPIRING 
AND OF COURSE THE CHURCH IS TRYING TO BRING US ALL TOGETHER 
AND HELP US ALL COME TOGETHER WITH ONE CAUSE IN OUR BELIEF IN GOD 
IN LIVERPOOL YOU SEEM TO SEE THESE WORKS OF ART EVERYWHERE 
IT'S GREAT TO GET THE PEOPLE OUT IN THE CITY LOOKING ROUND 
AND THIS SUPER LAMB BANANA 
IT'S TO WARN MAYBE OF THE DANGERS OF GENETIC ENGINEERING HALF LAMB HALF BANANA 
IT'S WORTH A LOOK ISN'T IT 
YEAH IT'S AMAZING 
IT'S CALLED TURNING THE PLACE OVER 
WE'RE AN EXPRESSIVE PEOPLE IT'S ALL ABOUT SHARING IT WITH EVERYBODY 
TELLING PEOPLE HOW WE DO THINGS HOW WE ARE 
ARTIST CECILIA MATSON HAS MADE HER HOME HERE 
AND IT'S THE RENEWAL OF THE CITY THAT INSPIRES HER 
I CAME UP FROM LONDON WHERE I HAD BEEN AT ART COLLEGE 
AND I STUDIED HISTORY AND POLITICS IN LIVERPOOL 
AND I'M ONE OF MANY STUDENTS WHO STAYED IN THE CITY BECAUSE I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT 
CECILIA TOOK ME TO SEE ONE OF HER FAVOURITE VIEWS OF THE CITY 
BUT IT WASN'T QUITE WHAT I EXPECTED 
O. K. SO YOU'VE BOUGHT ME TO THE TOP OF A CAR PARK ER WHY 
ERM WELL THIS IS THE KIND OF SITE THAT I PAINT 
AND IN FACT I'VE DONE QUITE A FEW SERIES OF PAINTINGS FROM THIS VERY CORNER 
I CAN SEE IT'S A LOVELY VIEW BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S BASICALLY JUST A BUILDING SITE WITH CRANES ISN'T IT 
WHEN I FIRST CAME TO LIVERPOOL THERE WEREN'T ANY CRANES AT ALL 
AND I ACTUALLY GOT SO EXCITED WHEN THEY STARTED TO ARRIVE 
I DESCRIBE THEM LIKE A MIGRANT FLOCK OF BIRDS THEY'VE LANDED ON THE CITY 
AND THEY'RE ONLY HERE FOR A TIME AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA GO 
THEY'RE LIKE NOMADIC ARCHITECTURE 
BUT WHEN THEY'RE HERE THEY ARE THE CATALYST FOR ALL OF THIS 
AND WITHOUT THEM NONE OF THIS WOULD BE HAPPENING 
AND THEY'LL HAVE MADE THIS CITY BETTER YEAH BUT I ACTUALLY LIKE THIS POINT THE BEST 
WHEN IT'S ALL FINISHED AND IT'S SHOPPING CENTRES 
I THINK IT GOES A BIT MORE STATIC AGAIN 
EVERYONE CAN'T WAIT FOR THE WORK TO FINISH BUT I WILL MISS THEM 
COME ON LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF YOUR WORK IN PROGRESS 
OH WOW I'LL BE OFTEN PAINTING BUT QUITE OFTEN WAITING FOR HOURS 
THAT'S INK ISN'T IT THIS IS ALL INK YES 
IT'S ALL BLACK INK WHICH I'LL DILUTE TO GET THE DIFFERENT COLOURS OUT 
AND JUST SORT OF BECOME MORE AND MORE ADEPT 
AT KNOWING WHAT CONCENTRATION TO USE TO GET THE EFFECT I WANT 
I CAN UNDERSTAND MANY ARTISTS PAINTING GOD'S NATURAL WORLD IF YOU LIKE 
WELL I THINK FOR ME I'VE ALWAYS PAINTED CITIES A PORTRAIT OF A CITY 
I DON'T PUT PEOPLE IN THEM 
BUT I BELIEVE BY PAINTING A CITY YOU'RE PAINTING A PORTRAIT OF MAN 
IF YOU BELIEVE MAN IS MADE IN GOD'S IMAGE AND GOD IS THE ULTIMATE CREATOR 
THEN TO ME THIS IS EXHILARATING IT IS LIKE SEEING WHAT GOD HAS INSTILLED WITHIN US WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF 
AND THAT CAN BE FOR GOOD AND IT CAN BE FOR BAD 
BUT THIS IS MADE IN HIS IMAGE IT'S CREATING 
WHEN YOU BELIEVE 
LIKE I BELIEVE 
YOU CAN TURN YOUR LIFE AROUND AND LIVE YOUR DREAM 
WHAT MAKES YOU STRONG 
WHAT DRIVES YOU ON 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALONE WHEN YOU BELIEVE 
HERE'S TO THE GIRL 
I LEFT BEHIND 
THE ONE WHO THOUGHT THE WORLD 
WOULD ALWAYS PASS HER BY 
SHE LOOKS AT ME NOW 
WITH WONDER IN HER EYES 
SHE KNOWS HOW FAR I'VE COME 
HOW HARD I'VE TRIED 
WHEN YOU BELIEVE 
LIKE I BELIEVE 
YOU CAN TURN YOUR LIFE AROUND AND LIVE YOUR DREAM 
WHAT MAKES YOU STRONG 
WHAT DRIVES YOU ON 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALONE WHEN YOU BELIEVE 
HERE'S TO THE WOMAN 
I HAVE BECOME 
THE ONE WHO WANTS TO THANK YOU 
FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE 
YOU LIFT ME HIGH LIFT ME HIGH 
YOU GAVE ME WINGS TO FLY WINGS TO FLY 
AND ALL I WANT TO SAY 
YOU TAKE MY BREATH AWAY 
LIKE I BELIEVE 
WHEN YOU BELIEVE 
LIKE I BELIEVE 
LOOK AT ME NOW 
THE WONDER I CAN'T HIDE 
I KNOW HOW FAR I'VE COME 
HOW HARD I'VE TRIED 
THE WAY I FEEL INSIDE 
WHEN YOU BELIEVE 
LIKE I BELIEVE 
YOU CAN TURN YOUR LIFE AROUND AND LIVE YOUR DREAM 
WHAT MAKES YOU STRONG 
WHAT DRIVES YOU ON 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALONE WHEN YOU BELIEVE YEAH 
LIKE I BELIEVE LIKE I BELIEVE 
YOU CAN TURN YOUR LIFE AROUND AND LIVE YOUR DREAM 
WHAT MAKES YOU STRONG WHAT MAKES YOU STRONG 
WHAT DRIVES YOU ON 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALONE WHEN YOU BELIEVE 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALONE 
WHEN YOU BELIEVE 
HEAVENLY FATHER MAY THE MUSIC OF OUR LIVES BE THE SPIRIT OF PRAISE 
DRAW US TOGETHER THAT WE MIGHT BE UNITED IN PURPOSE 
AND THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING THERE 
THOUGH THE WORLD AROUND US IS EVER CHANGING 
AND MAY ALMIGHTY GOD BLESS YOU THE FATHER AND THE SON 
AND THE HOLY SPIRIT 
AMEN 
A HUGE THANKS TO EVERYONE AT THE METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL FOR MAKING US FEEL SO SO WELCOME 
WE'RE GOING TO END WITH A HYMN BASED ON THE MAGNIFICAT 
THAT FAMOUS SONG OF MARY TELL OUT MY SOUL 
NEXT WEEK ON PENTECOST SUNDAY
