STRONG LANGUAGE 
WELCOME TO THE COMEDY MAP OF BRITAIN 
WHERE TONIGHT WE'LL START BY SAYING WAY AYE PET 
TO THE GOOD FOLK OF NEWCASTLE 
AND END UP SAYING SEE THEE LATER TO THE GOOD FOLK OF LEEDS 
I'M ALAN WHICKER YOUR GUIDE TO THE HIGHWAYS OF HILARITY 
ALTHOUGH AS SOME YORKSHIREMEN SEE CURMUDGEONLINESS AS A VIRTUE 
IT COULD BE A LONG NIGHT 
IN THE MEANTIME WE'LL BE SEEING WHERE THE CREATORS OF VIZ 
DISCOVERED THEIR LOVE OF TOILET HUMOUR 
THIS IS THE HOUSE WHERE VIZ WAS BORN 
I'VE ENTERED THE ONE HUNDRED METRE SPACEHOPPER RACE 
THESE GIANT GONADS ARE GOING TO EARN ME SOME FAST CASH HA I'VE WON 
WHERE MAUREEN LIPMAN FIRST TAILORED HER ACT 
AND HERE ON MY RIGHT 
WHAT WAS MAURICE LIPMAN'S OUTFITTING AND TAILOR'S SHOP 
THIS IS THE DOORWAY WHERE MY FRIENDS AND I CAME WITH A PLASTIC DOG TURD 
FROM THE JOKE SHOP PUT IT ON THE STEP 
AND HE CAME OUT AND HE WENT BLOODY HELL 
AND EAVESDROPPING AS LEIGH FRANCIS MEETS THE REAL AVID MERRION 
EHHHH 
OH IT'S NOT YOU IS IT 
OH MY FOOT HIM 
HELLO TO YOU HELLO TO YOU BO SELECTA THANK YOU PLEASE 
BUT WE START TONIGHT IN NEWCASTLE 
AND HEAD NORTH TO THE TRENDY SUBURB OF JESMOND 
NOW I LIKE A GOOD DOUBLE ENTENDRE AS MUCH AS THE NEXT MAN 
AND IF YOU LIKE I'LL GIVE YOU ONE 
YES WE'RE HEADING TO A VERITABLE HIVE OF SMUT 
THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE FAT SLAGS JOHNNY FARTPANTS AND BUSTER GONAD 
HOME OF THE ANARCHIC VIZ 
THIS IS THE HOUSE WHERE VIZ WAS BORN 
AND WE DID THE COMIC UP IN THE TOP BEDROOM THERE 
FOR ABOUT THE FIRST SEVEN YEARS 
WHILE OUR PARENTS DOWNSTAIRS HAD NO IDEA 
THAT IT ACTUALLY WAS GOING ON 
JOHNNY FARTPANTS 
THERE'S ALWAYS A COMMOTION GOING ON IN HIS TROUSERS 
HELLO READERS 
MY NAME IS JOHNNY FARTPANTS 
I'VE GOT A NOISY BOTTOM PHTT PHTT 
SOMETIMES I CAN'T HELP LETTING OFF 
DID YOU HAVE A NICE DAY IN SCHOOL JOHNNY 
WELL ERM PHTTTTT 
HERE WE GO CRIKEY 
WELL LOOK THERE'S STILL A CRACK IN THE CEILING WHERE DAD FELL THROUGH AYE 
HE ONLY GOT A LEG THROUGH 
I CAN RE ENACT THE DRAWING OF THE VERY FIRST CARTOON 
THE CHAIR THAT I WOULD HAVE SAT ON WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE 
AND THERE WAS A CARD TABLE HERE RECORD PLAYER DOWN THERE 
AND I'D HAVE ME HEADPHONES ON 
AND I'D BE SITTING DRAWING A CARTOON ON THE CARD TABLE HERE 
THIS IS THE FIRST EVER ISSUE OF THE COMIC 
ERM NOT MUCH TO LOOK AT 
IT HAD JOKES 
IT HAD JOKES IN IT AND THE PICTURES ARE TERRIBLE 
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT Y'TURD 
PAUL WHICKER THE TALL VICAR 
MORE VIOLENT MORE OBSCENE 
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A FUCK THE POPE JUMBLE SALE IN THE CHURCH HALL 
NOWT TO DO WITH ME JOHN ER I MEAN YOUR REVERENCE 
SOUNDS WELL OUT OF ORDER 
I REMEMBER COMING THROUGH THIS DOOR AND PRESENTING 
MY FIRST STRIP TO CHRIS I DIDN'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO 
IT WAS A FAIRLY LOOSE BRIEF YOU HAD BUT YOU CAME UP WITH THAT 
AFTERNOON TEA WITH MR. KIPLING 
IT WAS ABOUT A BLOKE WHO HAD SEX AND HAD A CAKE HE HAD SEX WITH MR. KIPLING'S WIFE 
AND ATE SO MUCH CAKE HE WAS SICK THEN THREW UP IN THE TOILET 
IT ALL GOT ASSEMBLED ON THE CARD TABLE IN THAT CORNER 
THE FLOOR WAS COVERED IN LITTER 
ABSOLUTELY OFF CUTS OF PAPER AND ALL SORTS OF SHIT ON THE FLOOR 
ME PARENTS NEVER CAME IN HERE 
I ACTUALLY SMOKED HERE FOR FIVE YEARS 
AND ME DAD NEVER KNEW I SMOKED YOU COULD DO ANYTHING UP HERE 
I COULD HAVE GOT MARRIED UP HERE AND HAD A FAMILY 
MUM WAS VERY VERY VERY VERY CONSERVATIVE 
AND WE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO DO THE COMIC 
IF SHE'D BEEN PHYSICALLY ABLE TO COME UP THE STAIRS 
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE LET US 
SHE WOULD HAVE BURNT ALL THE BLINKING CARTOONS IF SHE'D FOUND THEM 
BUT SHE WAS DOWNSTAIRS ALL THE TIME COS SHE WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR 
THE B. B. C. GOT IN TOUCH 
AND THEY WANTED TO MAKE A LITTLE FILM ABOUT THE COMIC 
AND HOW SUCCESSFUL IT WAS 
IT HAD BEEN GOING FOR THREE YEARS BY THEN 
BUT WHILE THE B. B. C. WERE HERE MY DAD COLLARED A SOUNDMAN 
AND ASKED HIM WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN THE HOUSE 
HE SAID WE'RE FILMING THE LADS UPSTAIRS WITH THEIR COMIC 
HAVE YOU GOT A MESSAGE IS VIZ COMIC TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING 
WE'RE MAKING SORT OF LIFE A BETTER THING TO LIVE YOU KNOW 
THAT'S ALL I'D SAY 
HOW ABOUT YOU CHRIS 
I'LL GO ALONG WITH THAT YEAH 
AFTER THE B. B. C. HAD GONE HE SAID 
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A COMIC YOU'RE DOING UPSTAIRS 
AND ME MUM ASKED IF SHE COULD SEE ONE 
SO I SAID WE'D SOLD OUT BUT I WOULD GET ONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
I TOLD HER THAT FOR AGES AS WELL 
SID THE SEXIST 
THINK I'LL GAN OOT ON THE TAP 
AYE GET A BIT OF LASH ON 
OVER THERE JOE DIVVENT FANCY YOURS MUCH 
EH BLOODY BURGLAR'S DOG THAT MAN 
I'VE GOT THE FIRST EVER SID THE SEXIST IN THIS FOLDER 
WHICH I DREW IN THE BEDROOM 
THAT'S IT THERE 
THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I EVER HAD WITH SID THE SEXIST 
IS IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO DRAW A WOMAN'S FACE 
WITHOUT MAKING HER LOOK UGLY 
I WANTED TO TRY AND DO SOMETHING WHAT'S SHE LIKE 
OH BUT SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE UGLY 
THAT'S THE PRETTY ONE LOOK AT THAT MAN THERE'S THE PRETTY ONE THERE 
SHE'S SMILING AYE YOU CAN TELL 
FUCKING HELL DO YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE VIZ HUMOUR 
NAH PEOPLE OFTEN SAY THAT VIZ IS ABOUT LAVATORIES 
AND IT'S ABOUT SORT OF BAD BEHAVIOUR AND DRUNKENNESS 
BUT WE WERE BASICALLY A FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE BUNCH 
AND IT WASN'T ABOUT LAVATORIES 
BUT IT WASN'T SO I THINK PEOPLE WHO OH HERE WE GO 
EXAMPLES OF LAVATORY HUMOUR PAGE ONE LOOK 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THERE WAS MORE TO IT THAN THAT 
THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN TOILETS I GIVE UP 
THERE WAS ONE I DID ABOUT THE BAIRN 
THE BAIRN IS SHITTING AND PISSING AND BEING SICK 
IT'S GOT A LITTLE COCK 
THERE'S MORE TO IT MATE YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT SUPERFICIALLY 
I THINK THE THING THE THING THAT ANNOYED US THE MOST 
ABOUT THE TOILET HUMOUR ACCUSATION WAS IT WAS ALMOST THE SUGGESTION WAS 
THAT IT WAS JUST TOILET AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING ELSE TO IT 
WHEREAS OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS SORT OF 
TOMMY AND HIS MAGIC SHOES 
AWAY FROM JESMOND AND WEST ACROSS TOWN HEADING TO BYKER 
THE B. B. C. COMPLAINTS LINE WILL NOW BE LIGHTING UP 
AS SCORES OF IRATE GEORDIES TRY TO CORRECT OUR GEOGRAPHY 
AS BYKER IS ACTUALLY EAST OF JESMOND 
BUT THE KIDS' T. V. SHOW THAT LAUNCHED ANT AND DEC'S CAREERS BYKER GROVE 
WAS ACTUALLY SHOT HERE IN BENWELL 
HELLO 
THIS IS WHERE WE'D ALL SIT IN BETWEEN FILMING THE POOL TABLE'S STILL HERE 
IT SEEMS REALLY SMALL DOESN'T IT 
I ALWAYS REMEMBER THERE BEING HUGE CHAIRS AND STUFF 
ALL THE WAY ALONG THERE 
NEXT NAME DUNCAN SPELLING 
HOW OLD ARE YOU ANYWAY TWELVE GET UP 
YOU LOOK ABOUT NINE LIKE I NEED THE CASH MAN 
AND ANT CAME ALONG AND 
THIS IS THE ROOM WHERE THEY FIRST ACTUALLY MET I THINK IT WAS YEAH 
WHENEVER NEW CAST MEMBERS CAME IN WE WERE SITTING HERE 
AND THEY CAME VERY SHEEPISHLY THROUGH THE DOOR 
ANT WOULD HAVE COME THROUGH HERE 
LIKE A RABBIT CAUGHT IN THE HEADLIGHT COMING IN FOR THE FIRST TIME 
DECLAN WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN THE LAST PERSON TO GET UP 
AND GREET HIM COS DECLAN WAS REALLY QUITE RESERVED IN THAT WAY 
COS I REMEMBER DECLAN SAYING HE THOUGHT ANT WAS A BIT OF A THUG WHEN HE COME 
A BIT OF A THUG AYE 
AH AH AH UP 
I'M THE CHAIRMAN 
YOU'RE THE TREASURER 
WE NEED A SECRETARY AS WELL 
CAN YOU DO SHORTHAND DEBORAH NO 
I DON'T THINK IT WAS AN INSTANT FRIENDSHIP IT WASN'T SOME SORT OF EPIC MOMENT 
WHEN ANT AND DEC MET EACH OTHER IT DEFINITELY WASN'T LIKE THAT 
THE CLOSENESS STARTED TO FORM 
WHEN THE TWO CHARACTERS WERE PUT TOGETHER IN THE STORYLINES 
COME ON P. J. 
MWAH MWAH MWAH 
THE SENSE OF HUMOUR THAT THEY'VE GOT NOW WAS FORGED IN THE BYKER GROVE SET BECAUSE JUST BEING WITH 
IT WAS ALWAYS BETWEEN FIFTEEN TWENTY KIDS TOGETHER ALL THE TIME 
AND IT WAS JUST A CONSTANT BATTLE OF WITS ALL THE TIME 
WE ALWAYS USED TO TRY AND GET ONE OVER ON EACH OTHER 
IT WAS LIKE WHO COULD GET THE FUNNIEST LINE 
RAPS I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW TAKING IN A LOT 
THINKING OF THE DAY WHEN YOU REALLY MEANT A LOT 
THINKING OF THE DAYS WHEN ALL WE'D DO WAS LOVE 
THINKING OF US NOW THE LOVE WE HAVEN'T GOT 
YOU SUDDENLY GET A PHONE CALL AND SOMEBODY SAYS 
WOULD I MAKE A TRACK THAT THEY COULD THEN PERFORM ON 
NO THOUGHT AT THAT STAGE ABOUT DOING A DEAL AND GETTING IT COMMERCIALLY RELEASED 
IT WAS JUST PURELY SOMETHING TO GO IN BYKER GROVE 
TONIGHT I'M FREE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW AWFUL IT LOOKS BUT THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE PLACE THAT WE RECORDED TONIGHT I'M FREE 
WE DECIDED THAT RATHER THAN HAVE ANOTHER SONG 
ON THE EXTRA TRACK ON THE C. D. WE WOULD HAVE ANT INTERVIEW DEC 
AND I GENUINELY THOUGHT THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND HOURS 
CUTTING BITS OUT AND MAKING THIS THING WORK AND LITERALLY 
I JUST HIT RECORD AND OFF THEY WENT 
IF YOU HAD TO BE REINCARNATED 
WHO WOULD YOU WANT TO BE OR WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO BE 
WHAT WOULD I WANT TO BE AS THEY SAY IT'S A DOG'S LIFE YEAH SO I WANT TO BE A BUDGIE 
IT WAS FUNNY AND IT WAS DRY AND IT WAS JUST GREAT 
HOW MANY HATS DO YOU HAVE MATE 
I'VE GOT ONE HAT I DON'T WEAR HATS 
IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS GOING TO BE I'M NOT THAT GOOD 
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER OUR FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN IS UNABLE TO BE HERE TONIGHT 
WILL BRADLEY REALISE THE MAN IN THE VIDEO IS ACTUALLY ANT 
GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY NOPE HE'S GOT NO IDEA 
AS YOU KNOW OUR MASCOT DOTTIE THE DUCK HAS BEEN ILL 
AND YESTERDAY SHE PASSED AWAY 
TO CELEBRATE DOTTIE'S LIFE 
JOIN ME IN A TOAST TO DOTTIE 
TO DOTTIE IT'S VERY SAD NEWS ABOUT DOTTIE 
IF WE COULD HAVE A MOMENT'S SILENCE IN RESPECT OF DOTTIE 
IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THE TWO MOST FAMOUS NORTH EASTERNERS 
WERE A FORMER PIG FARMER AND A SOLICITOR 
BETTER KNOWN TO ALL AS VIC AND BOB 
BUT BEFORE THEIR BIG NIGHTS OUT AND SHOOTING STARS 
VIC REEVES MADE HIS T. V. DEBUT HERE AT THE HOME OF TYNE TEES TELEVISION 
ON THE LEGENDARY MUSIC SHOW THE TUBE 
THIS TUBE GAVE ITS NAME TO THE TUBE 
WHICH WAS LIKE THE COOLEST MUSIC CULTURE 
YOUTH CULTURE SHOW IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO CHANNEL FOUR WELCOME TO THE TUBE 
WE'RE BACK TO OUR LIVE FORMAT AND HERE IS THE FABULOUS U. TWO 
THE FABULOUS UNDERTONES 
WOULD YOU WELCOME BAD NEWS 
THE WHOLE REASON WHY WE WERE MIMING AND WHY SOME PEOPLE WEREN'T MIMING 
IS THAT SOME PEOPLE AREN'T QUITE GOOD ENOUGH AT PLAYING THE BASS 
THE ONLY REASON I CAN'T PLAY PROPERLY IS COS I HURT MY FINGER YESTERDAY 
IT WAS MAYBE THE FIRST MOMENT IN TELEVISION FOR A WHILE 
WHERE MUSIC AND COMEDY HAD GONE TOGETHER AGAIN 
GIVE ME THE MICROPHONE JUST GIVE ME THE MICROPHONE GET OFF 
WE'D HAVE PEOPLE FROM THE COMIC STRIP AND WE'D HAVE PEOPLE LIKE THE YOUNG ONES 
SO I SAID TO VIC I THINK YOU SHOULD COME UP IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT 
BUT AT THIS TIME PEOPLE HADN'T HEARD OF HIM 
GOOD EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WELCOME TO SQUARE CELEBRITIES AND LET'S MEET THOSE CELEBRITIES 
WE'VE GOT A LAD WHO LIKES TO GET FRESH IT'S GAZ TOP 
OH HA HA HA 
I'M TRYING TO WORK OUT WHERE IT WAS 
ER I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AGAINST THAT WALL 
AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LEADING INTELLECTUAL STANLEY UNWIN 
I'M TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW HIGH I WAS 
IT WAS SORT OF SOMEWHERE UP THERE 
HOWAY THE LADS IT'S JIMMY NAIL 
AND OF COURSE LAST BUT NOT LEAST 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN INTERNATIONAL SINGING STAR MADONNA 
THERE WAS A PROGRAMME CALLED CELEBRITY SQUARES 
WHICH HAD NINE CELEBRITIES IN BOXES 
AND YOU TRIED TO PLAY NOUGHTS AND CROSSES WITH THEM 
SO HE SAID I'D LIKE TO DO THAT 
BUT OF COURSE IT MEANT BUILDING A HUGE GREAT SET 
PLEASE SELECT A CELEBRITY ANY CELEBRITY YOU'D LIKE GAZ GAZ TOP 
YOU WANNA GO FOR GAZ TOP O. K. 
VIC THEN SAID WHEN I ASK THEM QUESTIONS 
I WANNA BE ON A WIRE SO I CAN BE SORT OF SWISHED AROUND THE STUDIO 
VIC REEVES ASK OUR GUESTS THEIR FIRST QUESTION 
YOU ALL RIGHT THERE GAZ I'M FINE JOOLS ARE YOU WELL VIC 
I THINK THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM WHEN HE KIND OF FLOATED UP WHICH IS JUST BONKERS REALLY 
LISTEN TO THE QUESTION GAZ 
IT'S WORRYING A GROWN MAN FLYING ABOVE YOUR HEAD 
FILM STAR KIRK DOUGLAS IS A MAN 
GAZ CAN YOU GIVE ME THE NAME OF A WOMAN 
IT'S CALLED A KIRBY WIRE AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE PARTICULAR PEOPLE OPERATING IT 
AND A PARTICULAR MACHINE TO DO IT WHICH LIFTS THE PERSON UP ALL OVER THE STUDIO 
ENDLESS INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEMS 
IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT 
STANLEY STANLEY UNWIN 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO HAVE A FELLOW WHO JUST FLEW AROUND 
BUT I THINK AFTER DOING IT ONCE IT PUT HIM OFF 
ROD STEWART THE SOCCER MAD NOSEY PARKER OF POP 
HAS BEEN MARRIED TO AN ASTONISHING THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND WOMEN 
JIMMY CAN YOU NAME THEM 
THE ANSWER IS MRS. STEWART OF COURSE 
MALCOLM GEARY WHO WAS THE BRILLIANT PRODUCER OF THE TUBE I REMEMBER HIM SAYING 
I DON'T THINK HE'S REALLY GONNA BE WORTH 
MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES OF PRIME TIME TELEVISION DO YOU 
WELCOME TO SHOOTING STARS 
WELCOME WHOEVER YOU ARE 
THE STARS HAVE BEEN GREETED AND SUCCESSFULLY SEATED 
SO COME ALONG AND LET'S START SHOOTING STARS 
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT THAT VERY FIRST PERFORMANCE WITH THE SQUARE CELEBRITIES 
YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF THE ELEMENTS THAT HE THEN LATER USED 
BEING ON WIRES 
IT'S A BEAR 
CARDBOARD CUT OUTS 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK YES 
TERRY SCOTT 
BOB HOSKINS FACE SHADOWS 
BEING OBSESSED WITH THE LENGTH OF THINGS 
GAZ TRUE OR FALSE 
PAUL DANIELS' HEAD IS WIDER THAN IT IS LONG 
SQUARE CELEBRITIES WAS THE BEGINNINGS OF USING A QUIZ 
IN A WAY WHERE THE ANSWER DIDN'T REALLY MATTER 
IT WAS THE QUESTION THAT WAS THE BEST BIT 
THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW IS OVER SIXTEEN MILES LONG SARAH 
BUT CAN YOU TELL ME THE LENGTH OF VAL DOONICAN'S ARMS 
IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE CAREER OF A COMEDY KING 
AND A SURREALIST GOD VIC REEVES 
THE COMEDY MAP INVOLVES COVERING VAST DISTANCES 
IN THE SPACE OF A FEW SECONDS 
BUT THE NEXT STOP ON OUR TOUR IS THE SHORTEST 
AS WE HEAD BACK TO TYNE TEES STUDIOS 
WHERE THE MAN WHO TURNED FOPPISHNESS INTO AN ART FORM 
TOOK HIS FIRST BUMBLING CHARMING STEPS TO STARDOM 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WELL WE ARE THE JOCKEYS OF NORFOLK 
AS IN FACT YOU'VE JUST GATHERED FROM THE TITLES 
WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE ABOUT THOSE EITHER 
UM BEING CHRIS LANG MYSELF HUGH GRANT AND ANDY TAYLOR 
WE FELT AS OUR SHOW REQUIRES AN ENERGETIC AND VIBRANT BEGINNING 
WHY NOT KICK OFF TONIGHT WITH A MAORI WAR DANCE 
ONE TWO THREE 
OOH AAH OOH OOH 
AAH OOH 
AH TU TU SH AH ISI MA WOO AH AH AH 
OOH AH OOH AH 
OOH AH 
OOH AH WOOOOOOOOO 
BOH SWAAZY HOO YAH HOO YAH BOH SWAAZY HOO YAH 
WE'LL LEAVE HUGH THERE AND TURN OUR ATTENTION 
TO NEWCASTLE'S MOST CELEBRATED COMEDY SONS 
A PAIR KNOWN SIMPLY AS TERRY AND BOB 
WE FIRST MET DICK CLEMENT AND IAN LA FRENAIS' LIKELY LADS IN THE MID SIXTIES 
BY THE TIME WE FOUND OUT WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THEM IN THE MID SEVENTIES 
THE CITY OF NEWCASTLE ITSELF WAS JUST AS MUCH A PART OF THE STORY 
AH WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU 
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ME 
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED WRITING 
TO BE ABLE TO PUT MY HOMETOWN ON THE MAP 
THERE'S A CREDIT SEQUENCE AND A SONG 
AND IT'S SAYING OH LOOK WE'RE IN NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE 
THESE LOCATIONS IN THE TITLE SEQUENCE WERE CHOSEN TO SHOW VERY MUCH 
HOW THIS CITY WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF TRANSITION 
WELL I'M STANDING A BIT LIKE JIMMY BOLAM DID 
IN A SHOT FROM THE OPENING CREDITS OF WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE LIKELY LADS 
IN BYKER DIFFERENCE WAS BEHIND JIMMY THEN WAS A ROW 
OF WORKING CLASS TERRACED HOUSES NOW IT'S TREES AND SPACE 
THEN THE BUS WENT PAST HIM THAT WAS TO SHOW HE WAS WORKING CLASS 
HE WAS WAITING FOR THE BUS BOB HAD A CAR 
BUT WHAT I FIND UNBELIEVABLE IS IN THIS VERY STREET WHERE WE FILMED 
THEY HAVE NOW CALLED IT BOLAM WAY 
NOW THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE IS THERE A BEWES CRESCENT 
OR A BOULEVARD CLEMENT LA FRENAIS IN THE AREA 
IS THIS A COINCIDENCE 
OR DID I MEAN HE WAS HERE FOR WHAT ONE HOUR'S FILMING 
THE SHOTS IN THE CREDITS REFLECT TERRY'S BACKGROUND 
IT WAS ALL THE OLD IT WAS WORKING CLASS 
IT WAS BOARDED UP HOUSES THAT WERE ABOUT TO COME DOWN 
IT WAS DEMOLITION ORDERS 
SEE THAT LOT THAT'S ALL COMING DOWN IN A COUPLE OF YEARS 
WELL AT LEAST ERIC'S STILL SURVIVED JUST 
WHAT REFLECTED BOB'S WORLD 
WAS ESTATES CARS UPWARD MOBILITY 
NUMBER EIGHT THAT WAS BOB'S HOUSE BOB AND THELMA'S LOVELY HOME 
AND WHEN OF COURSE TERRY CAME HE HAD TO DEMEAN THE VERY IDEA 
THAT THIS WAS SOME SORT OF ASPIRATION 
THERE SHE IS 
EH IT'S A CANNY LITTLE HOUSE THOUGH BOB 
WE HAVEN'T GOT A NAME FOR IT YET 
WELL YOU'LL CERTAINLY NEED ONE WON'T YER 
OR YOU'LL NEVER FIND IT AGAIN 
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME AREN'T THEY THERE'S ROWS OF 'EM 
NO THEY'RE NOT 
IT WAS AN ERA OF MASSIVE DEVELOPMENT NEW ESTATES 
AND WE WANTED SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT FINISHED 
COS AGAIN IT WAS REFLECTING TRANSITION TRANSITION TRANSITION 
OF THE CITY OF THE LANDSCAPE AND OF THE BOYS' LIVES 
IT'S A VISUAL METAPHOR YOU SEE 
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE AFTER 
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING DEPRESSING ABOUT THESE ESTATES 
THE THOUGHT OF YOU ALL GETTING UP AT THE SAME TIME 
ALL EATING THE SAME SORT OF LOW CALORIE BREAKFAST CEREAL 
ALL COMING HOME AT HALF PAST SIX SWITCHING ON THE SAME PROGRAMME AT THE SAME TIME 
AND HAVING IT OFF THE SAME TWO NIGHTS OF THE WEEK 
SO THIS STREET AND THESE HOUSES BECAME A SYMBOL FOR BOB OF HOW FAR HE'D COME 
AND A SYMBOL FOR TERRY OF HOW FAR BOB HAD BETRAYED HIS CLASS 
WHICH OF COURSE WAS A LOAD OF BOLLOCKS 
AH WHAT HAPPEND TO YOU 
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ME 
WHAT BECAME OF THE PEOPLE 
WE USED TO BE 
AH WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU 
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ME 
WHAT BECAME OF THE PEOPLE 
WE USED TO BE 
AFTER ALL THIS BELTING AROUND THE COUNTRY 
COVERING VAST DISTANCES IN A MATTER OF SECONDS 
IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT WE FOUND OURSELVES IN COURT 
SO HERE WE ARE JUST ACROSS THE TYNE BRIDGE 
AT GATESHEAD MAGISTRATES COURT 
WHERE THE NORTH EAST'S FINEST STAND UP BOBBY THOMPSON 
KNOWN AS THE LITTLE WASTER SPENT VALUABLE TIME 
THIS IS GATESHEAD AGISTRATES COURT IT USED TO BE MAGISTRATES 
BUT SOMEONE HAD A BIG WEEKEND AND STOLE THE M. 
NOWADAYS THE MAGISTRATES COURT THEY HAND OUT FINES AND ASBOS 
AND TO BE HONEST THIS ONE'S BEEN HANDING OUT ASBOS LIKE THERE'S A SUMMER SALE ON 
BUT BACK IN THE SIXTIES THE MAGISTRATES COURTS WERE A BIG INSPIRATION 
TO LOCAL HERO FUNNY MAN AND COURT OFFENDER BOBBY THOMPSON 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING STAND UP 
EVERYONE WOULD ALWAYS SAY TO ME OH HAVE YOU SEEN LITTLE BOBBY 
AND I WAS THINKING WHAT'S LITTLE BOBBY HAS SOMEONE LOST A DOG 
AND THEY'D GO NO THE LITTLE WASTER THE LITTLE WASTER 
I'D GO GAZZA HE DOESN'T DO STAND UP 
NO LITTLE BOBBY THOMPSON 
AS SOON AS I HEARD THAT I WENT BOBBY THOMPSON 
I GOT A VIDEO OF HIM HE WAS BRILLIANT 
THANK YOU 
EEE OOH I'M NOT LAUGHIN' I CANNAE SLEEP FOR DEBT 
I'M UP TO THERE 
I WISH I WAS A BIT TALLER 
WHEN YOU WATCH IT HIS WHOLE SET IS ABOUT DEBT 
KNOCK AT THE DOOR LAST THURSDAY 
MR. THOMPSON IN 
EEEH COME IN TAKE A SEAT 
I'M COMING IN TO TAKE THE LOT 
AND ABOUT BEING IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE IN COURT 
AND I WAS JUST STANDING LIKE THAT 
AND THIS FELLA WITH THE WHITE LANG HAIR 
HE SAYS JOHN THOMAS ROBERT MICHAEL CLINTON HENRY FOSTER SMITHSON 
LAMBERT COATSON DAVIDSON THOMPSON DIDN'T CALL US BOBBY 
BOBBY STARTED OFF AS A PERFORMER AS A STAND UP 
AND THEN HE GOT ON TO DO A RADIO SHOW WHICH WAS IN THE LATE FIFTIES 
AND THAT REALLY TOOK OFF WOTCHER GEORDIE 
MY FATHER'S CAREER TOOK A DIVE WHEN HE WENT ON THE TELEVISION 
THE FIRST TWO EPISODES MY MOTHER WROTE THE SCRIPT 
AND IT WAS HUNKY DORY IT WAS TOP OF THE CHARTS 
AND THEY BROUGHT PROFESSIONAL SCRIPTWRITERS IN 
AND THINGS STARTED TO GO DOWNHILL 
THE SERIES WAS FOLDED AFTER FIVE OR SIX EPISODES 
AND THAT CAUSED HIM A REAL DOWNFALL 
EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WASN'T FUNNY AND HE COULDN'T GET BACK IN THE CLUBS 
FROM BEING PAID FOUR HUNDRED A WEEK FOR A TOP HEADLINER 
HE WENT DOWN TO LIKE SIX A WEEK 
SO IT WAS TERRIBLE FOR HIM COS HE COULDN'T PAY HIS BILLS DIDN'T PAY HIS NATIONAL INSURANCE 
WHICH THEN MEANT THAT HE ENDED UP HERE 
TAX PEOPLE SENT ME A NASTY LETTER 
SO I WROTE BACK AND SAID I DIDN'T GET IT 
THIS IS A GUY IN THE NORTH EAST WHO'S BIGGER THAN JOHN TRAVOLTA 
HE WAS LIKE A SUPERSTAR WHO WAS REDUCED 
TO BEING PUT IN HERE LIKE A PETTY CRIMINAL 
LIKE ALL THE LITTLE SCALLYWAGS AND THE CHARVERS IN THE NORTH EAST 
THEY TOOK US TO COURT COURT WAS PACKED THEY KNEW I WAS ON 
THE LITTLE WASTER SAT HERE 
INSTEAD OF BEING PANICKED AND FREAKED OUT BY THE RAILINGS YOU FEEL LIKE AN ANIMAL LOCKED IN HERE 
BUT LITTLE THOMPSON WAS SAT IN HERE JUST THINKING THIS IS GREAT 
I CAN GET MORE ROUTINES FOR ME ACT 
BOBBY THOMPSON 
HOW YER KEEPING 
WHEN HE CAME BACK WE IMAGINED THAT HE WAS GOING TO TALK 
ABOUT WHAT HE'D DONE IN LONDON THE MONEY HE'D BEEN PAID ON THE WOGAN SHOW ETC ETC 
BUT ALL HE COULD TALK ABOUT WAS THE THREE HE HAD TO PAY FOR A HAM SANDWICH IN A HOTEL 
AND IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY CRUSTS ON 
LOVELY TO SEE YOU COME OVER HERE AND SIT DOWN FOR A MOMENT 
YOU'RE PROBABLY THE BEST DRESSED MAN WE'VE HAD ON THIS SHOW 
ALL THIS NEW FOUND FAME ALL THIS NEW WEALTH 
HE HAD THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS 
HE ENDED UP WASTING ALL THIS MONEY ON CASINOS AND DRINK AND ON THE BOOKIES 
SO IT WAS JUST ONE BIG ROLLER COASTER FOR BOBBY THOMPSON 
EVERY TIME HE'D GO UP AND GET THE MONEY HE'D BE BACK DOWN AGAIN 
AS LONG AS HE HAD MONEY IN HIS POCKET HE WASN'T REALLY BOTHERED THAT'S JUST HIS HISTORY 
BILLS WEREN'T OF ANY INTEREST TO HIM AND HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T PAY ANY VAT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE 
WHEN HE PASSED AWAY HE ACTUALLY ENDED UP OWING ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND IN UNPAID TAXES 
YOU BELIEVE BOBBY THOMPSON 
IF YOU PAY 'EM WHAT YOU OWE YOU'LL NEVER AVE NOWT 
LEAVING TYNESIDE BEHIND WE HEAD SOUTH TO DURHAM 
HOME OF THE FIRST EVER CONGESTION CHARGE 
A BEAUTIFUL CATHEDRAL AND ITS CHORISTER SCHOOL 
WHICH EDUCATED AN INTERNATIONAL COMEDIAN 
WITH A KNACK FOR CUNNING PLANS TALL TALES AND FACIAL TICS 
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT MR. BLAIR 
WELCOME TO THE DURHAM CHORISTER SCHOOL 
IT WAS HERE IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT A NINE YEAR OLD BOY 
FIRST TOOK HIS TENTATIVE STEPS IN THE DIRECTION OF A COMEDY CAREER 
HIS NAME WAS ROWAN ATKINSON 
ALL RIGHT COME ON SETTLE DOWN PLEASE 
WE'RE NOW IN WHAT WAS ROWAN ATKINSON'S FIRST CLASSROOM THE THIRD FORM ROOM 
IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT NOW BECAUSE THERE ARE BEDS IT'S A DORMITORY 
AND THIS HAPPENS TO BE A GIRLS' DORMITORY 
SOMETHING UNHEARD OF IN ROWAN'S DAY 
ISN'T LIFE TRAGIC 
I DIDN'T SEE REALLY ANY EVIDENCE OF ROWAN AS A FUNNY PERSON 
DON'T SULK BOY FOR GOD'S SAKE 
HAS MATRON SEEN THOSE BOILS 
IT IS SAID THAT HE DID WONDERFUL TAKE OFFS OF MEMBERS OF STAFF DOWN IN THE SHOWERS 
THIS IS THE CHANGING ROOMS UNDERNEATH THE SCHOOL WHERE PROBABLY ROWAN DID SOME OF HIS BEST WORK 
THE STAFF WOULD HAVE MANNERISMS 
TUGGING THEIR LAPELS AND TWEAKING THEIR GOWNS 
MR. CROSBY USED TO TWIRL HIS GOWN ARMS ROUND AND ROUND HIS HANDS 
THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF NERVOUS MANNERISMS 
HE WOULD DO EXACTLY THE SAME HERE 
HE'D TAKE A COAT OR A TOWEL OFF THE WALL AND ROLL IT ROUND AND ROUND 
WE'D FALL ABOUT COS WE ALL KNEW WHO IT WAS ABOUT 
I VAGUELY REMEMBER AT THE AGE OF ABOUT OOH TEN ELEVEN 
SORT OF STANDING UP IN THE SCHOOL CHANGING ROOMS IN FRONT OF THE OTHER PUPILS AND DOING SOMETHING 
I CAN'T REMEMBER 
DOING SOMETHING TO AMUSE MICHAEL 
DOING SOMETHING THAT AMUSED PEOPLE GREATLY 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN IMPERSONATION OF A MATHS MASTER OR SOMETHING 
PART OF ME WONDERS WHAT OF MY MANNERISMS HE MIGHT HAVE PICKED UP 
I HAVE A DETENTION BOOK 
VERY EARLY IN THE DAY'S PROCEEDINGS 
ALL THE CLASSES WOULD COME IN HERE FOR ASSEMBLY 
THIS PROBABLY INVOLVED ROLL CALL 
AND THAT'S WHERE USUALLY THE HEADMASTER WOULD SIT 
AT THIS LARGE DESK WITH THIS HUGE LEDGER 
CALLING OUT THE NAMES TICKING THEM OFF AS THEY WENT THROUGH 
ANSWER YOUR NAMES 
AINSLEY 
BABCOCK 
BLAND 
WHEN I SAW HIM PERFORM IN THE THEATRE LIVE 
I WAS TAKEN IMMEDIATELY BACK TO HERE BECAUSE HE MUST HAVE USED THE HEADMASTER 
AS HIS MODEL FOR THE ROLL CALL BECAUSE HE USED TO ROLL OUT THE R.'S 
IN PEOPLE'S NAMES AND SOME OF THE NAMES WOULD BE VERY LONG AND INVOLVED YOU KNOW CAR PEN TER 
HAEMOGLOBIN 
AND THERE WAS ANOTHER FELLOW CALLED LONGBOTTOM 
NIBBLE 
SOME OF THESE NAMES ARE RIPE FOR A HEADMASTER 
WHO ISN'T TAKING THE MICKEY 
BUT HE WAS MAKING SURE THAT WE KNEW THAT HE WAS IN CHARGE 
ORIFICE 
THE UNUSUAL NAMES ARE ALWAYS A TARGET FOR THE BOYS 
FOR A LITTLE SNIGGER OR A GIGGLE HERE AND THERE 
ELLESWORTH BEAST MAJOR 
AND I CAN SEE WHERE HE PICKED THAT UP AND REMEMBERED THESE ODD NAMES 
UNUSUAL NAMES AND MADE SOMETHING OUT OF THEM FOR HIS PART 
NANCYBOY POTTER 
THE WHOLE THEATRE WAS FALLING ABOUT 
IT WAS ALMOST THE SAME AS THE SCHOOLBOYS 
AND WE'D BE FALLING ABOUT BECAUSE THE GUY JUST HAD A GIFT 
TO AMUSE PEOPLE AND MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH 
ZOB 
ABSENT 
IF I WERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE NEXT STOP IS TO VISIT ROYSTON VASEY 
YOU'D BE THINKING THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN 
BUT IN FACT WE'RE AFTER GRANGETOWN MIDDLESBROUGH 
HOMETOWN OF THE MAN WHO INSPIRED THAT NAME ROY CHUBBY BROWN 
REAL NAME ROYSTON VASEY 
THIS IS THE MAGNET HOTEL AT GRANGETOWN 
A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE 
I MADE A VERY BOLD DECISION HERE 
I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU INSIDE FOLLOW ME 
I AT THE PARTICULAR TIME WAS DOING TWO ACTS 
YOU KNOW LIKE A CLEAN ACT FOR THE CATHOLIC CLUBS 
AND A DIRTY ACT FOR THE STAG NIGHTS 
AND MY AGENT CAME AND HE SAID WHERE CAN I MEET YOU ROY 
AND I SAID AYE COME DOWN THE MAGNET AND WE'LL HAVE A PINT 
YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE SAID IT WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE SEVENTY TWO 
WE SAT HERE TWO PINTS OF BEER 
AND HE SAID ROY YOU HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE 
YOU CAN BE A BLUE COMEDIAN 
MY MATE SAID CHUBBY YOU'RE IN THERE HERE NEW CONDOM 
I SAID WHAT'S THAT IT'S A BRAND NEW CONDOM NEW ON THE MARKET 
SAFE AS HOUSES SAFE AS A FUCKING BARRATT HOUSE NO TROUBLE 
LET ME TELL YOU IT ISN'T 
I WAS FUCKING HER AND HER BOYFRIEND CAME BEHIND ME AND HIT ME WITH A FUCKING BASEBALL BAT 
OR A CLEAN COMEDIAN 
I WAS IN A SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND A WOMAN SAID OH ARE THESE THE LIFTS THAT GO UP 
I SAID NO THESE ARE THE LIFTS THAT GO SIDE TO SIDE 
DON'T FORGET AS A CLEAN COMEDIAN I CAN GET YOU UP TO FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE A NIGHT 
AS A BLUE COMEDIAN I CAN GET YOU FIFTY A NIGHT IT'S UP TO YOU 
I WILL SAY THIS AS A CLEAN COMEDIAN 
THERE'S NINE THOUSAND OF YOU TRYING TO GET ON T. V. 
BLUE COMEDIAN THERE'S A HANDFUL 
DO YOU WANT TO BE WEALTHY OR DO YOU WANT TO BE A STAR 
HERE WE HAVE MIDDLESBROUGH COMEDIAN ROY BROWN 
YOU'RE ABOUT TO WATCH MY FIRST T. V. PERFORMANCE THIS IS THE EARLY SEVENTIES 
THEY ASKED ME IF I COULD DO A CLEAN ACT SO THIS IS IT 
SOMEBODY ONCE SAID TO ME WHERE ARE YOU FROM 
I SAID MIDDLESBROUGH HE SAID WHAT PART I SAID ALL OF ME 
I THINK I'M BETTER LOOKING NOW 
IF YOU LIVE IN MIDDLESBROUGH ON A CLEAR DAY YOU CAN SEE THE MUCK 
I THINK I PUT CHUBBY BROWN ON THE SCREEN FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME 
THE CLEAN STUFF THAT HE DID FOR ME WAS ABSOLUTELY ACCEPTABLE IT WAS PERFECTLY GOOD 
IF YOU'RE COMING TO MIDDLESBROUGH FOR YOUR HOLIDAYS DON'T FORGET SUMMER'S ON A WEDNESDAY 
I REMEMBER THERE WAS A HESITATION IN HIS ACT FOR ME ON THAT SHOW 
WHEN HE NEARLY SAID SOMETHING AND THEN KNEW HE COULDN'T 
I ACTUALLY WORKED AT I. C. I. BUT THE FOREMAN WAS A RIGHT 
WELL I DAREN'T SAY IT 
THESE DAYS I'D HAVE SAID THE FOREMAN'S A RIGHT FUCKING ARSEHOLE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOD BLESS 
I FOUND THAT THE BLUE MATERIAL WAS MORE ME 
AND I SPOTS ONE ABOUT SIXTEEN YEAR OLD 
FUCKING HELL I MEAN HALF MY AGE 
I WALKED UP GOING HI BABY 
FUCK ON THE FIRST NIGHT SHE WENT NO SO I SAID SEE YOU TOMORROW 
IF MARGARET DOWN THE ROAD HAD BETTER CURTAINS THAN MY MOTHER SHE WANTED BETTER CURTAINS 
DAD SAID HANG ON WHERE DO YOU THINK 
I DON'T SHIT MONEY SO WHERE'S THAT WORD COME FROM SHIT 
I DON'T SHIT MONEY 
DO YOU THINK I FART FUCKING FIVERS 
THAT WAS THE LANGUAGE YOU GOT IN OUR HOUSE 
NO WE HAD FUCK ALL US TO BE HONEST WE HAD FUCK ALL 
I MEAN MAM HAD TO GIVE THE MANAGER OF TOYS R. US A BLOW JOB JUST TO GET A FUCKING BALLOON 
THE EARLY TIMES WHEN I STARTED DOING THESE CLUBS 
I KNEW WHAT TO SAY TO MAKE THEM LAUGH 
I TELL YOU WHAT I'LL NEVER WASH THEM AGAIN 
ERE I NEED THIS SIGNED YOU HAVEN'T ANY ROAD 
THEY WANTED YOU TO TALK TO THEM IN THEIR LANGUAGE 
THEY DON'T WANT YOU TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT HAD TO BE BLUE MATERIAL 
STEVIE IS IT 
CAN I REST ON ONE OF THEM YEAH ALL RIGHT 
HOW OLD IS HE ELEVEN 
I'LL PUT FUCK OFF THEN 
DEFINITELY MADE THE RIGHT DECISION THAT DAY DEFINITELY 
YOU COME FROM THIS ENVIRONMENT MONEY'S EVERYTHING TO YER 
I'LL E. F. F. AND BLIND FOR ANOTHER FIFTEEN QUID 
EIGHTIES ROCK GOD CHRIS RHEA HAILS FROM MIDDLESBROUGH 
AND IS PROBABLY BEST KNOWN FOR HIS TRACK ROAD TO HELL 
INSPIRED APPARENTLY BY THE NOTORIOUS A ONE SEVENTY ONE TO SCARBOROUGH 
AND IT WAS HERE IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
IN THIS RATHER BRACING CORNER OF BRITAIN 
THAT RIK MAYALL SET HIS AWARD WINNING FILM DANCING QUEEN 
IT WAS ON THIS VERY SPOT THAT VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING 
WE HAD RIK MAYALL RUNNING AROUND WITH NO TROUSERS ON 
WHERE ARE THEY 
AAAAGH 
WHERE ARE THEY GIVE HIM A CHANCE 
WHERE YOU GOING ON YOUR HONEYMOON VENICE 
M. M. M. VENICE WELL TOMORROW YOU'LL BE IN VENICE 
SCARBOROUGH WILL BE A DISTANT MEMORY 
IT'S ABOUT HERE THAT RIK WAS SQUATTING IN THE FILM 
WHICH YOU'LL NOTICE IS SOME WAY AWAY FROM THE STATION 
BECAUSE AS FAR AS I REMEMBER IT 
BRITISH RAIL HAVING READ THE SCRIPT 
SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT LIKE US TO FILM ON THEIR PREMISES 
BECAUSE IN THEIR WORDS WE WOULD HAVE GOT HIM HOME 
WE ENJOYED THE PROGRAMME VERY MUCH BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH IT WAS 
THAT THE WHOLE DRAMA WAS UNDERMINED 
BY THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NO DIRECT SERVICES FROM LONDON TO SCARBOROUGH 
SUCH A SITUATION WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE 
HE'D BE TURNED BACK AT YORK 
SO FOR ME AFTER THE FIRST FEW MINUTES I COULDN'T REALLY ENJOY THE REST OF THE PROGRAMME 
ON THE FIRST DAY I THINK OF THE SHOOT 
THERE WAS A BLIZZARD AND SO THE DIRECTOR NOT WANTING TO BE BEATEN 
JUST BASICALLY PUSHED RIK OUTSIDE AND MADE HIM RUN AROUND ANYWHERE HE COULD FIND WEARING NO TROUSERS 
I WANT TO GET MARRIED 
RIK HAD TO COLLAPSE OUT HERE IN THE SEA 
WITH THE WAVES LAPPING AROUND HIM 
AFTER SEVEN OR EIGHT TAKES THEY CALLED CUT 
HE STOOD UP IN THE WAVES AND HE SORT OF STARTED TO SOB 
AND AT THAT POINT WE REALISED THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH 
WHAT SEEMED TO BE THE BEGINNINGS OF HYPOTHERMIA 
BUT FOR RIK THERE WAS ACTUALLY WORSE TO COME 
I DON'T WANNA BE HERE I WANT TO BE IN MAIDSTONE 
NOT THIS GODFORSAKEN STINKING FREEZING FISH PORT FROM HELL 
AT THE ARSEHOLE END OF THE A ONE 
SO WE HAD RIK RUNNING AROUND SCARBOROUGH WITH NO TROUSERS ON 
WE NEARLY KILLED HIM IN THE NORTH SEA AND THEN WE COVERED HIM IN FISH GUTS 
THAT'S VERY STRONG WRITING 
THE WINNER IS RIK MAYALL 
I'D JUST LIKE TO THANK QUICKLY WHILE I'M HERE THE WRITERS 
WHOEVER THEY WERE 
STICKING TO THE COAST WE NIP OFF NOW TO HULL 
OR MORE ACCURATELY KINGSTON UPON HULL 
BIRTHPLACE OF MAUREEN LIPMAN 
A LONG TIME BEFORE B. T. CAME CALLING 
A YOUNG MAUREEN SPENT SATURDAY AFTERNOONS IN HER DAD'S TAILOR SHOP 
IN THE CENTRE OF TOWN SIZING UP THE COMEDY POTENTIAL 
WE'RE IN MONUMENT SQUARE OLD HISTORIC HULL AND HERE 
ON MY RIGHT WHAT WAS MAURICE LIPMAN'S OUTFITTING AND TAILOR'S SHOP 
YOU'LL SEE THAT ON THE RIGHT OF THE SHOP ARE THE DOCKS 
AND MY FATHER'S ADVERT IN THE HULL DAILY MAIL SAID MAURICE LIPMAN'S SHOP IS NEXT TO THE DOCKS 
DROP IN AND SEE HIM YEP 
SO AS YOU CAN SEE THAT'S WHERE I GOT MY EARLY COMEDY FROM 
THERE'S A LADY OF THE NIGHT A PROSTITUTE 
SHE SAYS SHE'LL DO ANYTHING ON EARTH FOR TEN 
IF YOU CAN DESCRIBE IT IN THREE WORDS 
SO THE YORKSHIREMAN COMES IN AND SAYS PAINT MY HOUSE 
AND THIS WAS A VERY FUNNY SHOP BECAUSE MY DAD DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING 
HE WOULD TAKE AN ORDER CHAT AND THEN THROW AWAY THE PIECE OF PAPER 
FOUR WEEKS LATER THE GUY WOULD COME FOR HIS SUIT 
AND HE HADN'T ORDERED IT MY MOTHER USED TO GO MAD 
MY MOTHER WAS FEROCIOUSLY FASTIDIOUSLY PRECISE 
AND MY DAD WAS JUST AH LISTEN THEY'LL GET THE SUIT FOR ANOTHER WEDDING 
OOPS MIND THE STEP 
OH 
IT'S A VIDEO GAME SHOP YOU KNOW IT'S JUST 
GOD 
SO YOU'D HAVE HAD THE COUNTER ALL ALONG HERE WINDOW FULL OF CLOTHES 
THERE WOULD BE SHIRTS IN GLASS DRAWERS 
THE OLD FASHIONED ARE YOU BEING SERVED SORT OF SHIRTS HERE 
AND THEN THE TIES I THINK WOULD BE ALONG HERE ON DISPLAY 
MY DAD HAD THIS WAY OF TAKING A TIE AND EXPERTLY KNOTTING IT AND PUTTING IT INTO A JACKET 
AND DOING IT AGAIN SAYING MARVELLOUS LOOK AT THIS TIE 
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST YOU IT'D BE ABOUT SIXTEEN QUID 
AND THE GUY WOULD GO WHAT 
DAD SAID YOU GET A FREE SUIT WITH EVERY ONE 
I THANK YOU KINDLY LEAVE THE SHOP 
MY DAD HAD A GENTS' OUTFITTING SHOP 
IT HAD A HUGE SIGN UP WHICH SAID READY TO WEAR DEPARTMENT DOWNSTAIRS 
THERE WAS NO READY TO WEAR DEPARTMENT AND THERE WAS NO DOWNSTAIRS 
SO YOU HAD TO SAY TO HIM WHAT'S IT DOING THERE 
HE SAID BURTONS WERE GOING TO GET RID OF IT I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD SIGN 
AND THEN HERE A DOORWAY 
AND THEN THE REST OF THE SHOP PROBABLY CAME TO ABOUT HERE 
THE ADULT PLAYSTATION SECTION 
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF IT MY DAD BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED 
VERY VERY SMART BRILLIANTINED HAIR 
AND JUST MR. CHARMING HELLO HOW ARE YOU THE FAMILY 
HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY FROM ADAM BUT PRETENDED 
YOU CAN TAKE A FLIPPING FERRY THERE FROM HULL 
I SAYS WHERE'S HULL HA HA HA BECAUSE HULL WAS WHERE HE LIVED 
MY MUM WAS TERRIBLY FUNNY BUT SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHY SO SHE WOULD SAY 
THINGS LIKE I SAY DON'T A BLACK SKIRT COVER A MULTITUDE OF SINS 
DON'T IT SOON GET TO TEN TO TEN 
THEY MAKE MUSHY PEAS TOO GREEN THESE DAYS THEY MAKE 'EM TOO GREEN 
YES EXCUSE ME 
WHO'S SHE STICKING HER OAR IN 
MY DAD WAS MUCH MORE CYNICAL DRY AND FORGETFUL 
VERY FORGETFUL ALWAYS 
AFTER THEY GOT MARRIED HE TOOK HER TO THE CINEMA GOT BORED WITH 
THE FILM SO HE WENT AND PLAYED SNOOKER 
AND THEN HE WENT BACK TO HIS MOTHER'S HE FORGOT HE WAS MARRIED 
THAT SORT OF THING WAS ALWAYS HAPPENING 
YOU KNOW THE JEWISH ACTOR WHO RINGS HIS MOTHER MAMA MAMA I'M SO EXCITED I'VE GOT THE PART 
I'M PLAYING THE HUSBAND SHE SAYS YOU COULDN'T GET A SPEAKING PART 
I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THIS SHOP WHEN THERE'S A JOKE ABOUT A COUPLE WHO ARE 
EMPTYING THE TILL ON A FRIDAY AND HE SAYS GO AND PUT IT IN THE BANK 
AND SHE SAYS NO I NEVER PUT IT IN THE BANK ON A FRIDAY 
I PUT IT IN ME KNICKERS 
HE SAYS PUT IT IN YOUR KNICKERS 
YEAH SHE SAYS IT'S THE SAFEST PLACE 
THEY GO OUT THEY GO TO THE PICTURES THEY GO HOME 
SHE'S TAKING HER CLOTHES OFF 
SHE SAYS THE MONEY'S GONE I DON'T UNDERS HE SAYS 
YOU SAID YOU PUT IT IN YOUR KNICKERS HOW CAN IT HAVE GONE 
SHE SAYS I DON'T KNOW I'LL RETRACE ME FOOTSTEPS WE WENT TO THE RESTAURANT 
I DIDN'T GO TO THE LOO WE WENT TO THE CINEMA OH THAT'LL BE IT 
THE MAN NEXT TO ME HAD HIS HAND IN ME KNICKERS DURING THE FILM 
THE HUSBAND SAYS YOU SAT THROUGH THE FILM AND YOU LET A MAN A STRANGE MAN PUT HIS HAND IN YOUR KNICKERS 
SHE SAYS WELL HOW DID I KNOW HE WAS A THIEF 
ANOTHER FAMOUS CHILD OF HULL IS COMIC NORMAN COLLIER
