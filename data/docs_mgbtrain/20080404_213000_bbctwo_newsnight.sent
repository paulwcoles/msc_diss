MUGABE FIGHTS ON BUT AT WHAT COST 
TO ZIMBABWE 
TONIGHT ROBERT MUGABE REFUSES TO 
GO QUIETLY HIS WAR VETERAN 
SUPPORTERS ARE ON THE STREETS AND 
HIS PARTY IS BACKING PLANS FOR A 
RUN OFF ELECTION WHICH COULD TAKE 
MONTHS WE WILL SPEAK TO A LEADING 
MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT 
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY TO ALLOW 
JOHN PRESCOTT TO EAT ON M. P.S' 
EXPENSES WE WILL HAVE THE DETAILS 
AND MR. OSBORNE GOES TO WALL STREET 
L. AM IN NEW YORK WITH GEORGE 
OSBORNE WHERE HE IS MEETING PEOPLE 
WHO RUN THE WORLD ECONOMY 
ON NEWSNIGHT REVIEW WITH PAUL 
MORLEY SHARON CALLER SERRA 
CHURCH WELL 
FILM MAKING IS CHILD'S PLAY IN SOME 
OF RAMBO 
THE NEWS BECOMES AL NOVEL BY GORDON 
BURN SON OF RAMBOW 
THE MEDIA GIVES US IMAGES OF 
EVERYTHING BUT ONLY IMAGES 
PONTIUS PILATE IS CALLED AS A 
CHARACTER WITNESS IN THE TRIAL OF 
DUBIOUS ISCARIOT 
I OBEYED MY 
EMPEROR AND DID MY DUTY 
AND AFTER 
ELEVEN YEARS THE RETURN OF PORTISHEAD 
GOOD EVENING IT LOOKS AS IF ROBERT 
MUGABE INTENDS TO FIGHT ON THAT IS 
THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION FROM THE 
DECISION BY HIS ZANU P. F. PARTY TO 
BACK HIM IN A RUN OFF ELECTION 
AGAINST MORGAN TSVANGIRAI ALTHOUGH 
WE STILL DON'T KNOW OFFICIALLY WHAT 
THE SUPPOSED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
RESULTS ARE OPPOSITION SOURCES 
BELIEVE ROBERT MUGABE MAY TRY TO 
DELAY THE RUN OFF FOR NINETY DAYS TO 
ENABLE HIM TO FIX THE RESULT 
QUITE AMAZINGLY THERE HAS STILL 
BEEN NO OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT AS TO 
WHO WON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 
HELD SIX DAYS AGO ONE KEY DECISION 
HAS BEEN MADE IF ROBERT MUGABE GET 
THE CHANCE FOR A SECOND ROUND AND 
IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT HE WILL HE 
WILL GO FOR IT HE IS GOING TO 
FIGHT 
WHEN WE WENT FOR THOSE FIGHT ELECTIONS WE ONLY USE TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF OUR 
CAPACITY SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT IN OUR RESERVES NOW 
THAT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT WILL COME OUT AS THE 
WINNER 
THE DECISION WAS MADE AFTER WINNER A FIVE HOUR CABINET MEETING IN THE 
POLITBURO MUGABE IS CLEARLY NOT 
GOING TO GIVE IN HE MAY HAVE BEEN 
OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED AS LOSING 
CONTROL OF PARLIAMENT BUT ZANU P. F. 
HAVE NOW DECIDED TO CHALLENGE THE 
OUT COME IN AT LEAST SIXTEEN SEATS 
MUGABE WALK WANTS TO WIN PARLIAMENT 
BACK ALTHOUGH THE M. D. C. CLAIM THAT 
THEY ALSO WON THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTIONS WITH OVER FIFTY PER CENT OF THE 
VOTE IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT ZANU P. F. 
ARE PREPARING FOR HIS SECOND ROUND 
WHICH WILL BE REQUIRED IF THE M. D. C. 
WON FIFTY PER CENT THERE HAD BEEN 
SUGGESTIONS THAT MUGABE WAS GOING 
TO MAKE A DEAL AND WAS PREPARED TO 
HAND OVER POWER HE HAS DONE QUITE 
THE OPPOSITE 
A RIGHT FROM THE 
START I NEVER THOUGHT MUGABE WOULD 
QUIT UNTIL HE WAS ACTUALLY 
PHYSICALLY REMOVED FROM OFFICE 
ALMOST IT HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE 
SHOCK TO HIM BUT HIS REACTION IS 
FIRST OF ALL TO HOLD EVERYTHING 
AND THEN WORK OUT HOW TO GET OUT OF 
THIS TRAP L. THINK HIS ONLY WAY OUT 
IS TO TRY FOR A SECOND ROUND AND 
SEE IF HE CAN REVERSE THE DEFEAT OF 
THE FIRST ROUND 
UNTIL THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS WERE 
ANNOUNCED WE CAN'T BE COMPLETELY 
SURE THERE WILL BE A SECOND ROUND 
BUT IT DOES HAPPEN AS SEEMS HIGHLY 
LIKELY WHAT WILL ROBERT MUGABE'S 
TACTICS BE THERE ARE WARNINGS THAT 
THE SO FAR PEACEFUL ELECTION WOULD 
SUDDENLY TURN DIRTY WAR VETERANS 
WHO HAD BEEN ACCUSED IN THE PAST OF 
ACTING AS REGARDED'S BULLY BOYS 
ATTACKING THE OPPOSITION AND TAKING 
OVER WHITE FARMS STAGED A SHOW OF 
SUPPORT FOR MUGABE AS THEY MARCHED 
THROUGH HER WORRY BEFORE ISSUING A 
NOT TO FAIL THREAT TO THE 
OPPOSITION HARARE 
WE MUST NOT 
BE PUSHED TO A SITUATION WHERE WE 
FEEL THERE IS A LOT OF INFRINGEMENT 
FROM OUTSIDERS IN THE PROCESS OF 
THE ELECTIONS THIS MAY COMPEL US 
TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS 
MUGABE'S 
MUGABE'S OPPONENTS WON THIS COULD BE SIGN 
OF VIOLENCE TO COME 
HE HAS LOST 
THIS ELECTION HE HAS BEEN REJECTED 
BY THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE IN 
TYPICAL FASHION HE IS A WOUNDED 
ANIMAL WHEN MUGABE IS IN THAT 
POSITION THAT IS WHEN HE WILL GO 
ALL OUT WE CAN EXPECT BLOODSHED 
THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER SIGNS OF A 
NEW HARD LINE OFFICES USED BY THE 
OPPOSITION M. D. C. AND A HARARE HOTEL 
HAS BEEN RANSACKED THE OPPOSITION 
BLAMED THE POLICE OR THE CENTRAL 
INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION TWO OF 
THE FOREIGN JOURNALISTS COVERING 
THE ELECTION WITHOUT OFFICIAL 
PERMISSION HAD BEEN CHARGED BY 
POLICE FOR VIOLATING MEDIA LAWS A 
LEADING LAWYER WARNED HE HAD 
LEARNED OF OTHER WORRYING 
DEVELOPMENTS 
WE ARE REFERRING TO DEVELOPMENTS SO MANY CASES ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
WHERE PEOPLE ARE BEING ARRESTED 
REPORTEDLY FOR CELEBRATING VICTORY 
OR SOMETIMES IF THEY HAVE GATHERED 
IN AREAS WHERE ZANU P. F. HAS ALREADY 
LOST AND HAS DECLARED THERE IS 
THAT ELEMENT 
IN RURAL AREAS THERE 
WILL BE THREATS THERE WILL BE 
GIFTS THERE WILL BE ALL SORTS OF 
THINGS TO TARGET PARTICULAR AREAS 
WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE DRIFTED AWAY 
FROM 
HIM L. WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST HIM I THINK HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
REVERSE THIS ON THE OTHER HAND 
YOU HAVE GOT M. D. C. ON A ROLL THEY 
CAN NOW SAY TO THE DOUBTERS WE CAN 
DO IT ONE MORE PUSH 
IT COULD GET 
NASTY 
IT COULD GET VERY NASTY AND NASTY THERE ARE SPLITS IN BOTH CAMPS SO 
THERE WILL BE QUITE A LOT OF DIRTY 
DEALING AT THE CROSSROADS I IMAGINE 
AS FOR THE GOVERNMENT THEY WARNED 
THE OPPOSITION TO BE PREPARED FOR 
WHAT IS TO COME AND COMPARED THE 
ELECTION TO A BOXING MATCH THEY THEY ARE RUNNING SCARED THIS IS NOT A 
GAME FOR COWARDS WE HAVE ONLY USED 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF OUR CAPACITY THEY SHOULD 
GET IN THE RING AND WE WILL GO 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT APPARENTLY 
GEARING UP FOR SECOND ROUND THE 
RESULT OF LAST ROUND IS STILL TO 
BE MADE KNOWN THE OPPOSITION ARE 
GOING TO COURT TOMORROW IN AN 
ATTEMPT TO GET IT RELEASED 
THE B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM REPORTING 
INSIDE ZIMBABWE BUT OUR WORLD 
AFFAIRS EDITOR JOHN SIMPSON IS IN 
THE COUNTRYSIDE WHAT IS YOUR SENSE 
OF WHAT IS GOING ON NOW 
WELL I 
THINK WHAT IS GOING ON WE HAVE HAD 
THIS BATTLE TODAY WITH AN ZANU P. F. 
THE POLITBURO IT DIDN'T SEEM IN 
FACT TO GO THE WAY THAT ROBERT 
MUGABE WOULD HAVE LIKED IT TOO AS 
FAR AS WE CAN TELL AND I HAVE BEEN 
SPEAKING TO A FAIRLY SENIOR ZANU P. F. 
FIGURE HE WASN'T IN THE MEETING 
BUT HE HAD A PRETTY CLEAR IDEA OF 
WHAT WENT ON ROBERT MUGABE WOULD 
HAVE LIKED TO DO WHAT THE REAL 
TOUGH CHARACTERS AROUND THE TABLE 
WANTED THAT WAS TO REALLY JUST GO 
FOR IT TO USE MARTIAL LAW ALL 
SORTS OF ROONEY POWERFUL 
INSTRUMENTS AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT 
THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF THEM 
LOSING POWER ALL SORTS OF 
POWERFUL AND INSTRUMENTS THE 
MODERATE FIGURES THERE ARE QUITE A 
FEW OF THEM AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE THE END OF ROBERT MUGABE ONE 
WAY OR ANOTHER THEY ARGUED THERE 
SHOULD BE A RUN OFF AND THEY SHOULD 
TAKE PART IN THE RUN OFF AND TAKE 
PART IN THAT ROBUSTLY ROBUSTLY 
MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT 
PEOPLE IN ZANU P. F. TO THOSE WHO ARE 
NOT AMONG THEM OF ARRESTS 
MODERATES IT MEANS HARD TACTICS 
HOW FAR SHOULD PEOPLE BE CONCERNED 
THAT WITH UP TO NINETY DAYS TOWARDS A 
POSSIBLE RUN OFF THIS GIVES MR. 
MUGABE AND HIS FRIENDS THE CHANCE 
TO FIX IT 
WELL IT GIVES MR. MUGABE 
AND HIS FRIENDS THE CHANCE TO GET 
VERY TOUGH TO DO AN AWFUL LOT OF 
INTIMIDATION AND TO TRY AND FIX 
THE ELECTION IN THAT WAY BUT YOU 
HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT ELECTIONS IN 
ZIMBABWE ARE NOW DIFFERENT FOR 
INSTANCE LAST SATURDAY'S ELECTION 
WOULD NEVER HAVE ENDED WITH WHAT 
SEEMS QUITE CLEARLY TO HAVE BEEN A 
VICTORY FOR MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IF 
THERE HADN'T HAVE BEEN CHANGES IN 
THE RULES IF THE GOAL POSTS HAVE 
BEEN MOVED BY OF ALL UNLIKELY 
ORGANISATIONS THE AFRICAN UNION 
THE AFRICAN UNION IS THE PLACE 
WHERE ROBERT MUGABE GOES TO GET 
STANDING OVATIONS PEOPLE SHOUTING 
HIS NAME'S TO THE HEAVENS LEADERS 
OF THE AFRICAN UNION KNOW PERFECTLY 
WELL THAT HE IS AN ENORMOUS 
EMBARRASSMENT TO THEM HE 
REPRESENTS THE PAST THEY WANT 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR THEMSELVES 
AND INDEED FOR AFRICA SO THEY 
HAVE IMPOSED ALL SORTS OF SMALL 
RULES ON HIM APPARENTLY SMALL 
RULES WHICH CHANGED EVERYTHING 
FOR INSTANCE NOW YOU HAVE TO POST 
AT THE FULL DETAILS OF THE BOAT 
OUTSIDE EVERY POLLING STATION WHEN 
THEY CLOSE A VOTE SO IT IS 
POSSIBLE TO FIND OUT WHO HAS VOTED 
FOR WHO WHO HAS THEREFORE ONE 
THAT CHANGE IS AN IMPORTANT ONE IT 
WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
I AM JOINED 
BY DAVID COLTART FROM THE M. D. C. ALSO 
PRESUMABLY YOU CAN'T BE SURPRISED 
THAT MUGABE IS GOING TO FIGHT ON 
I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL HE HAS A 
LOT TO ANSWER FOR BUT THE TRUTH OF 
THE MATTER IS THAT HE IS NOW PAWN 
HE HAS BEEN PUSHED INTO THIS BY 
HIS LIEUTENANTS PEOPLE MUCH 
YOUNGER THAN HIM BUT ALSO GUILTY 
OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND HAVE 
GOT A LOT OF ILL GOTTEN GAINS 
ROBERT MUGABE HAS CERTAIN 
IMPUNITY IMMUNITY RATHER IN THAT 
BECAUSE HE IS EIGHTY FOUR AND AN ICON OF THE 
LIBERATION STRUGGLE AFRICA WILL 
NEVER ALLOW HIM TO BE INDICTED IN 
THE HAGUE HIS LIEUTENANTS MUST 
FEAR THAT THEY ARE YOUNG ENOUGH 
HAVE A LOW ENOUGH PROFILE TO BE 
INDICTED 
THEY WANT HIM 
TO STAY ON INDICTED TO PROTECT THEM PRESUMABLY IT HAS 
BEEN QUITE GOOD FOR BUSINESS IT IT HAS BEEN VERY GOOD FOR BUSINESS 
THEY IN MY VIEW ARE PUSHING 
ROBERT MABEY INTO THIS TO FIGHT TO 
THE DEATH IN THE HOPE THAT HE WINS 
ROBERT MUGABE 
DON'T YOU HAVE A 
REAL DILEMMA L. DO YOU CAN BOYCOTT 
THE RUN OFF OR YOU CAN LEGITIMISE 
IT BY ACTUALLY TAKING PART WHAT 
ARE YOU GOING TO DO 
WE WILL FIGHT IT 
THAT LEGITIMISES 
IT 
IT DOES LELGT MICE IT IN A IT SENSE I DON'T THINK REMARKABLE 
PERSON BELIEVES OUR ELECTION 
PROCESS IS FAIR AND FREE ROBERT 
MUGABE REFRBGS BEING HUMILIATED IN 
THIS 
HOW WORRIED ARE YOU THAT WE THIS CAN SEE SCENES IN ZIMBABWE SIMILAR 
TO THOSE WE HAVE SEEN IN KENYA IN 
OTHER WORDS PEOPLE CONTESTING THE 
ELECTION DIFFERENCES BY FIGHTING 
THERE ARE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE 
KENYA HAD WHAT I TERM A PRESSURE 
COOKER DEVELOPMENT PEOPLE COULD 
NOT GET OUT OF KENYA ZIMBABWE HAS 
THE SAFETY VALVE OF LEAVING FOR 
SOUTH AFRICA AND BOTSWANA AND WE 
DON'T HAVE THE SAME ETHNIC DIVIDE 
EVERYONE IS AGAINST ROBERT MUGABE 
IF PEOPLE THINK THAT THE ELECTION 
IS BEING STOLEN AND THEY THINK THE 
SYSTEM COULD HELP THEM IT 
POTENTIALLY COULD LEAD TO VIOLENCE 
IT COULD VIOLENCE IRONICALLY IS 
MOST LIKELY TO COME FROM GIS A 
DISAFFECTED MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY 
THE RANK AND FILE IN THE MILITARY 
AND THE POLICE ARE ANGRY ABOUT THE 
DETERIORATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
IF ANY VIOLENCE IS TO ERUPT IT WILL 
COME FROM THAT QUARTER 
THERE'S AN 
OLD SAYING ABOUT AMERICAN POLITICS 
THE REAL SCANDAL IS WHAT IS 
PROHIBITED IT IS WHAT IS ALLOWED 
HERE WE HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT SOME 
OF OUR LEADING POLITICIANS ARE 
CLAIMING AS EXPENSES INCLUDING 
WITH THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER TONY 
BLAIR MONEY TO PAY FOR HIS T. V. 
LICENCE WHAT HAVE THE M. P.'S BEEN 
SPENDING THEIR MONEY ON 
WE HAVE 
HAD A GOSSIPY GLIMPSE BEHIND THE 
CURTAIN OF SECRECY BEHIND M. P.'S 
EXPENSES IN RESPONSE TO A COUPLE OF 
REQUESTS ONE BY THE B. B. C. THE 
AUTHORITIES HAVE OPENED UP AND 
GIVEN US SOME SMALL DETAILS ON 
PROMINENT POLITICIANS WE HAVE 
LEARNED THAT JOHN PRESCOTT CLAIMED 
FOUR THOUSAND ONE YEAR ON FOOD AND 
PROVISIONS FOR HIS CONSTITUENCY 
HOME A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER HE 
WAS ONLY CLAIMING TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED PERHAPS 
HE WENT ON A DIET TONY BLAIR 
CLAIMED ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN FOR A TELEVISION 
LICENCE FOR HIS CONSTITUENCY HOME 
AND GORDON BROWN THOUGH DID IN A 
DIFFERENT WAY HE CLAIMED ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FORTY ONE 
FOR T. V. SUBSCRIPTIONS LICENCE AND 
INTERNAL UPKEEP THAT SUGGESTS HE 
WAS SPENDING SOME OF THE MONEY ON 
WATCHING T. V. SPORTS IT IS LEGAL 
WITHIN THE RULES IT IS ACCEPTED 
M. P.'S SHOULD BE REIMBOROUGHSED FOR 
WHAT THEY SPEND ON THEIR SECOND 
HOMES 
MARGARET BECKETT IN THE YEAR HOMES SHE WAS FOREIGN SECRETARY WAS 
CLAIMING FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOR SERVICE AND 
MAINTENANCE ON HIS CONSTITUENCY 
HOME ALTHOUGH SHE HAD A GOVERNMENT 
HOME AND DAVID CAMERON HE WAS 
CLAIMING TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ON THE MORTGAGE 
INTEREST ON HIS CONSTITUENCY HOME 
ISN'T THIS FRANKLY TRIVIAL STUFF 
IT WILL BE PRESENTED TOMORROW THAT 
WAY BY THE TABLOIDS AND BY SOME OF 
THE BROADSHEETS IT'S A POINT ONE PUT 
TO THE JOURNALIST MOST DOGGEDLY 
PURSUING THIS THROUGH FREEDOM OF 
INFORMATION 
I THINK WHAT INFORMATION TRIVIALISED IT IS THE WAY THAT THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS HANDLED IT THEY 
COULD HAVE HAD A PROFESSIONAL AND A 
GROWN UP ATTITUDE AND MADE A PUBLIC 
REGISTER WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS IN 
AMERICA AND OTHER COUNTRIES 
INSTEAD THEY HAVE HAD A FARCE WHERE 
THEY DRIP FED TINY AMOUNTS OF 
INFORMATION AND THEY CREATE THE 
SOAP OPERA WHICH GOES ON TODAY 
ARE THEY GOING TO RELEASE IT WHEN 
TIME IS IT COMING THEY RELEASE 
IT AT THE END OF FRIDAY IT BECOMES 
A SOAP OPERA CARRY ON UP THE 
COMMONS THEY NEED TO GROW UP IS IS THERE ANOTHER INSTALLMENT THERE THERE ARE MANY MORE M. P.'S ARE TRYING TO 
STOP MORE DETAIL COMING OUT ALL 
THE INFORMATION IS ON MORE 
INFORMATION FOR OPENNESS THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY ARE ASKING THEIR 
FRONTBENCHERS TO COME OUT WITH 
ANOTHER DETAIL AND THERE'S ANOTHER 
FORCE SCOTLAND IF YOU LOOK ON THE 
SCOTTISH WEBSITE YOU'LL FIND ITEM 
BY ITEM WHAT M. S. P.'S SPEND THEIR 
MONEY ON DOWN TO PARKING METRES 
AND BOTTLES OF MILK 
I'M JOINED BY 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT M. P. NORMAN 
BAKER AND LORD SNAPE MR. BAKER HOW 
MUCH DO YOU THINK WE AS MEMBERS OF 
THE PUBLIC AND TAX PAYERS HAVE A 
RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT PUBLIC MONEY IS 
SPENT ON 
I THINK WE HAVE A THEY 
HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW SUCT TO 
CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS ONE IS TO 
PROTECT STAFF AND SECONDLY M. P.'S ARE 
ALLOWED TO TO KEEP ADDRESSES SECRET 
AND THIRDLY THE WE DON'T WANT TO 
GO DOWN THE ABSURD WHETHER I'M 
BUYING SKIMMED OR NON SKIMMED 
IT'S MORE TRIAL BY DO YOU WANT TO 
KNOW WHETHER DAVID CAMERON BOUGHT A 
MUMPY STEAM IRON YOU GUYS WILL 
PICK UP WHAT IS IN THE NEWSPAPERS 
IN MY DAY IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
WE WERE PAID AN ALLOWS OVER TWELVE 
MONTHS IT WAS ACCEPTED WE HAD TO 
HAVE SECOND HOMES BECAUSE THE JOB 
WAS IN LONDON AND THIS COVERED ALL 
THE THINGS LIKE TELEVISION LICENCES 
WHICH IS ABOUT WHICH YOUR 
PROGRAMME MADE A THING BECAUSE 
YOU'RE ON THE PUBLIC PURSE TOO 
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD SHUT UP 
ABOUT IT 
IF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT 
HAVE TO HAVE SECOND HOMES THEY 
SHOULD BE PAID AN ALLOWANCE LAID 
DOWN BY PARLIAMENT OR ANYBODY ELSE 
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE IT TO AN 
OUTSIDE BODY DO WE WANT A 
BREAKDOWN THAT NORMAN BAKER HAS 
GONE THROUGH 
WHY DO WE NEED IT IT IT IS A MATTER OF PUBLIC MONEY 
THERE'S NO POINT BLAMING THE 
TABLOIDS PARLIAMENT HAS RESISTED 
ALL CALLS FOR INFORMATION TO BE 
RELEASED THEY TOOK TWO YEARS THE 
INNOCUOUS REQUEST I MADE FOR 
TRAVEL BREAKDOWN WAS REFUSED WHY 
IS GORDON BROWN AND TONY BLAIR 
CLAIMING FOR A SECOND HOME WHEN 
THEY ARE GIVEN FREE ONE ANYWAY 
AND THEY ARE TRYING TO PREVENT 
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ALTOGETHER 
WE HAVE TO MOVE TO A SITUATION 
WHERE THERE'S COMMON SENSE THE 
COMMON SENSE IS WHERE PUBLIC MONEY 
IS SPENT THAT SHOULD BE PROPERLY 
ACCOUNTSAB E. 
AND WE SHOULD HAVE 
OPEN AND TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTS 
UNTIL WE GET THAT THIS WILL CARRY 
ON 
LORD SNAPE YOU SAID RECENTLY IS ON THE SPEAKER'S WIFE MEANT TO QUEUE 
WHEN SHE DOES HER SHOPPING TO MANY 
YES SHE SHOULD AND SHE SHOULD PAY 
FOR THE TAXIS HERSELF 
MOST OF THE 
LETTERS I GOT SAID THAT AND IT WAS 
A TEN SECOND PIECE OF ON A 
INTERVIEW AND THE I THINK THE 
DEPUET SPEAKER SHOULD HAVE A CAR 
AND A DRIVER HOW MANY BUREAUCRATS 
DOES IT NEED OR WILL IT NEED TO GO 
THROUGH ALL THE PAPERWORK NECESSARY 
TO PROVE WHO BOUGHT THE STEAM IRON 
AND WHERE IS IT REALLY NECESSARY 
ARE YOU SAYING WE SHOULD TRUST OUR 
M. P.'S TO SPEND MONEY WISELY AND THEY 
SHOULD NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO PAY 
OUT OF THE MONEY WE ALREADY PAY 
THEM FOR THINGS LIKE LUNCH 
IF YOU 
HAVE GOT TO HAVE A SECOND HOME YOU 
SHOULD ACCEPT THERE'S LOTS OF EXTRA 
COSTS I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY 
EMPLOYEES OF THE B. B. C. WOULD LIKE THE 
SCRUTINY THAT NORMAN BAKER IS 
PROPOSING I WOULD HAZARD A GUESS 
THAT YOUR SALARY IS MORE THAN THE 
AVERAGE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT L. 
DON'T KNOW IT ONE OF THE REASONS I 
QUIT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THIS IS 
NOT INFORMATION THAT I REPEAT IT'S 
TRIAL BY TRIFA 
IT IS TRIVIAL THE THE ARGUMENT ADVANCED WE SHOULD HAVE 
ACCESS TO LOTS OF MONEY AND NOT BE 
ACCOUNTABLE THAT LEADS TO WHAT WE 
HAVE GOT SMALL NUMBER OF M. P.'S 
CLAIMING FOR NON EXISTANT HOUSES 
WITH SITUATION WITH PEOPLE 
EMPLOYING MEMBERS OF FAMILY WHO 
WERE NOT EMPLOYED 
AND A SITUATION 
REVEALED BY MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT 
THEMSELVES NOT THE MEDIA THE 
MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT THREW THEIR 
HANDS UP 
THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE IN 
BOTH THOSE CASES IT WAS THE RESULT 
OF MEDIA EXCLUSIVES AND THE 
MEMBERS HAD TO REACT TO IT 
IT WAS 
A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT'S COMMISSION 
WHICH DISCOVERED THOSE FAILURES IT IT ISN'T 
YOU'RE ALWAYS READY TO RUSH ISN'T IN WITH THE QUOTES ON BEHALF OF 
ANYBODY ELSE L. DON'T THINK YOU'RE 
DOING PUBLIC SERVICE BY THIS SORT 
OF BEHAVIOUR 
DO YOU ACCEPT HOWEVER 
WHATEVER YOUR VIEWS ON THIS YOU'RE 
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY WE 
WILL FIND OUT WHICH STEAM IRONS 
PEOPLE BUY AND EVERY BIT OF THIS 
WILL COME OUT 
INDEED I DO THE 
LONG TERM RESULT OF THIS IS THE 
ONLY PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO WANT 
TO STAND TO PARLIAMENT THE ONES 
WHO DON'T CLAIM THE ALLOWANCES 
RICH ETONONS WHO WILL BE RUNNING 
US BECAUSE THEY WON'T HAVE TO 
CLAIM ANYTHING 
COUNCILLORS HAVE TO 
MAKE THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE PEOPLE 
IN BUSINESS HAVE TO PRODUCE 
RECEIPTS AND PEOPLE IN THE B. B. C. 
HAVE TO PRODUCE RECEIPTS WHY 
SHOULD M. P.'S IN A CLASS OF THEIR OWN

NEWSNIGHT'S DAVID GROSSMAN TAGGED 
ALONG UNIVERSE 
NEW YORK IS A UNCERTAIN CITY 
THE CHAOS IN THE GLOBAL MARKET IS 
CONFUSING EVEN FOR THE PEOPLE 
WHOSE JOB IT IS TO UNDERSTAND IT 
THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE HERE ARE THE 
ONES WHOSE PASSIONS ARE NOT EXPECT 
CONNECTED WITH THE FINANCIAL WORLD 
GEORGE OSBORNE'S PASSION IS TO 
BECOME THE NEXT CHANCELLOR HE'S IN 
NEW YORK TO MEET SOME OF THE PEOPLE 
WHO MAKE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WORK 
I'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND THE CREDIT 
CRISIS NOT HOW IT DEVELOPED BUT HOW 
IT PLAYED OUT I'LL BE MEETING THE 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF GOLDMAN SACKS OR 
BOB REBEN CLINTON'S SECRETARY AS 
WELL AS SOME OF THE REGULATORS SO 
THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK IN THE 
CITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING 
THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN THE CITY 
TAG TO THEM HOW THE CREDIT CRISIS 
IS PLAYING OUT IS EXTREMELY USEFUL 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IMPACT IN THE 
UNITED KINGDOM 
NOW TRADING HAS 
BEGUN 
THE FIRST VISIT TODAY WAS TO BEGUN THE STOCK EXCHANGE ARE YOU 
WONDERING WHY GROWN MEN ARE 
APPLAUDING A BELL YOU HAVE TO 
FACTOR IN THE ADRENALINE THAT 
STARTS PUMPING WHEN TRADING BEGINS 
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY 
DOES NOT HIGH THE FACT THAT THESE 
OBSCURE THE FACT THAT THESE MEN ARE 
GAMBLING ONE OF THE BIG 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE TRADERS 
AND THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN EUROPE IS 
THE PRICE OF MONEY THE U. S. INTEREST 
RATE IS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IN THE U. K. IT'S FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
IS THERE A VIEW ABOUT THE BRITISH 
ECONOMY 
THE BRITISH ECONOMY LOOKS ECONOMY PERHAPS MORE STABLE WE BELIEVE 
THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS BEEN 
GIVING THE CORRECT SIGNALS WE ARE 
CONCERNED WITH THE EUROPEAN SIGNALS 
WE BELIEVE THE CORRECTION 
DIRECTION TO GO IS TO EASE CREDIT 
WE SEE WEAKNESS IN THE ECONOMIES 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND I'M HAPPY BUILD 
KING HAS HOW MR. KING HAS BEEN 
SPEAKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
IF THE 
POLLS ARE TO BE BELIEVED THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE A BETTER CHANCE 
OF WINNING THE NEXT ELECTION THAN 
THEY HAVE HAD FOR AT LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS 
THAT MEANS GEORGE OSBORNE HAS MORE 
CHANCE OF MEETING THE BIG ECONOMIC 
PLAYERS THAN NORMALLY WOULD 
BRITISH OPPOSITION POLITICIANS YOU YOU CAN'T HELP BUT CONTRAST THE WAY THE 
BEAR STEARNS CRISIS WAS DEALT WITH 
OVER A WEEKEND BY THE FEDERAL 
RESERVE BANK WE HAVE SHOUTING IN 
NEW YORK FROM THE TRAFFIC YOU 
CAN'T HELP BUT CONTRAST THE WAY 
BEAR STEARNS WAS DEALT WITH A HUGE 
INVESTMENT BANK WITH FORTY T. R. I. L. L. I. O. N. OF 
LIABILITIES SOLD TO J. P. MORGAN AND 
CONTHRAFT THAT WITH NORTHERN ROCK 
WHICH TOOK SIX MONTHS TO RESOLVE 
IT USED TO BE AT THAT CAST IRON 
RULE OF BRITISH POLITICS WHEN THE 
BULL MARKET WAS IN RETREAT IT WAS 
GOOD NEWS FOR THE OPPOSITION THEY 
COULD SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR THE 
PUBLIC TO TURN TO THEM THAT RULE 
SEEMS TO HAVE BROKEN IN RECENT 
YEARS FOR GEORGE OSBORNE THE 
CHALLENGE IS TO ESTABLISH HIS PARTY 
IS MORE COMPETENT AND HAS THE 
BETTER POLICIES ON THE ECONOMY 
ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING 
THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES AT THE 
MOMENT IT DOESN'T STEAM HE HAS 
ESTABLISHED THAT FIRMLY ENOUGH YET 
IN THE PUBLIC'S MIND 
IF YOU LOOK 
AT THE CRUDEST MEASURE WHICH ARE 
THE OPINION POLLS WE HAVE GREATLY 
CLOSED THE GAP WITH THE LABOUR 
PARTY WITH ECONOMIC COMPETENCE 
WHEN I STARTED THIS JOB THREE YEARS 
AGO THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR WE WERE 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT BEHIND ON THE OPINION POLLS IN 
ECONOMIC CONFIDENCE THE LATEST 
POLLS PUT US AHEAD WHETHER THEY 
PUT US AHEAD OR BEHIND THE POINT 
IS WE'RE NOW IN TOUCH PEOPLE CAN 
SEE THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE 
CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO SOME OF 
THE ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE REGULATION 
A BIG ISSUE IS WHETHER THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND SHOULD BE IN CHARGE OF 
RESCUING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
LIKE NORTHERN ROCK THAT FAIL WE 
BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE ALISTAIR 
DARLING SAYS IT SHOULD NOT THE THE BRITISH HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN 
HONOURED GUESTS AT NEW YORK CITY

THE MAYOR IS PROPOSING A BILLION 
DOLLAR'S WORTH OF PROPERTY SALES

MOMENT I WOULD LOVE TO OFFER TAX 
REDUCTIONS AS THE AMERICANS ARE 
SPENDING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS ON TAX 
REDUCTIONS TO HELP AMERICAN 
FAMILIES WITH THE COST OF LIVING 
UNFORTUNATELY THE BUDGET DEFER SIT 
BRITAIN HAS HIGHER AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE CRISIS THAN THE 
AMERICAN BUDGET DEFICIT MEANS THERE 
ISN'T THE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE FOR A 
BIG REDUCTION IN TAX SOME BELIEVE 
OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS ALL 
POLITICS WILL BE ABOUT ECONOMICS 
WHICH PARTY CAN ASSURE NERVOUS 
VOTERS OPPOSITIONS MOSTLY ONLY GET 
TO REACT IN THIS CLIMATE THE 
SHADOW CHANCELLOR'S JOB OF TRYING 
TO DEVELOP AND EXPLAIN A CONSISTENT 
AND ATTRACTIVE MESSAGE FOR HIS
