IN TWO THOUSAND TWO LIVING THE DREAM FOLLOWED THE DARAR FAMILY WHEN THEY LEFT 
THEIR HOME IN SCOTLAND TO START THEIR DREAM BUSINESS IN SPAIN 
YOU THINK IT'S NICE UH HUH 
OPENING AN INDIAN RESTAURANT ON A LIMITED BUDGET CERTAINLY HAD ITS CHALLENGES 
WHY DIDN'T YOU EXPLAIN THAT ON MONDAY WHEN YOU SAID YOU'D HAVE THE MONEY FOR US HERE ON THURSDAY 
I ONLY REALISED THIS LAST NIGHT 
YOU'VE NOT BEEN HONEST PRITPAL THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T LOOK ME IN THE FACE 
I'VE HAD FOUR WEEKS AND NOTHING BUT AGGRAVATION FROM YOU 
SIX YEARS ON AND PRITPAL AND HIS WIFE NEELAM 
HAVE JUST OPENED A MORE UP MARKET RESTAURANT LA DIVA 
THE FACT THAT IT'S THEIR SECOND RESTAURANT ISN'T MAKING IT ANY EASIER 
A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE TOWN HALL CAN COME IN AT ANY TIME AND ASK FOR ALL MY PAPERWORK 
THEY CAN SAY SHOW ME THIS AND WHERE IS IT AND WE WON'T HAVE IT 
IF THE WORST COMES TO WORST I MIGHT HAVE TO CLOSE 
YOU KNOW I'M FEELING REALLY STRESSED OUT 
YOU KNOW ANXIETY NOT GETTING ANYWHERE 
IT'S THAT FEELING OF IS IT WORTH IT 
IT COMES BACK TO THE SAME OLD QUESTION IS IT WORTH IT 
PRITPAL HAS ALREADY SOLD HIS PIZZA AND PASTA BAR IN AYR TOWN CENTRE 
WHERE HE WORKED SEVEN DAYS A WEEK 
HIS WIFE NEELAM IS BORED OF HER JOB IN A LOCAL BOOKSHOP 
ALONG WITH THEIR CHILDREN SASHKIA AND ROHAN THEY HOPE TO ESCAPE 
THE COLD AND DAMP OF AYR AND START A NEW LIFE ON THE SPANISH COSTA BLANCA 
PRITPAL AND NEELAM DARAR ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CHALLENGE 
WE'VE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT EMIGRATING AT SOME POINT IN OUR LIVES I THINK MOST PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW 
AND IT'S UM IT'S JUST THE RIGHT TIME TO DO IT IT'S JUST THE RIGHT TIME TO DO IT 
BEFORE LEAVING SCOTLAND PRITPAL APPLIED FOR A LOAN OF TEN THOUSAND 
HE ALREADY HAS A LUMP SUM OF AROUND TWENTY THOUSAND TO INVEST IN THE PROJECT 
WE MISSED OUR CONNECTING FLIGHT FROM LONDON 
IT WAS JUST A LONG DAY IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY BUT FINALLY WE'RE HERE 
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME NOW WE JUST WANT TO GO HOME NOW 
HOME IS NOW JUST HALF AN HOUR'S DRIVE AWAY IN THE TOURIST RESORT OF FLAMENCA BEACH 
THIS IS WHERE THE FUN STARTS 
THIS IS THE FUN BIT 
UNTIL THE RESTAURANT OPENS ANY MONEY THAT PRITPAL AND NEELAM SPEND 
WILL BE EATING INTO THEIR CAPITAL 
AS WELL AS LIVING EXPENSES THEY ARE ALREADY PAYING OUT SEVEN HUNDRED EUROS A MONTH ON THE RESTAURANT 
FOUR HUNDRED EUROS A MONTH FOR THEIR HIRE CAR AND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY A MONTH ON A LOCAL PURPOSE BUILT VILLA 
YAY YAY 
IT'S NICE COME ON THEN 
IT'S WARM 
HOW'S THAT THAT'S NICE DO YOU LIKE IT SASH UH HUH 
YOU LIKE IT DAD LOOK IT'S THE BEACH 
I KNOW THAT'S THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA OVER THERE WICKED 
IT'S IDENTICAL WHEREVER YOU LOOK 
I WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND IT IT ALL LOOKS THE SAME 
PRITPAL'S RESTAURANT WILL BE SITUATED IN FLAMENCA BEACH COMMERCIAL CENTRE 
IT'S STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION BUT PRITPAL BELIEVES IT HAS HUGE POTENTIAL 
NOW HE CAN FINALLY SHOW IT TO HIS FAMILY 
IT'S LOVELY SEE THERE'S LOADS OF KIDS IT LOOKS LOVELY COME ON 
THIS IS NUMBER EIGHT 
AND 
VOILA THIS IS IT HERE 
IT'S GOT NO TOILET IT'S NOT DONE YET DARLING 
IT'S NOT DONE YET 
IT'S QUITE BIG IT'S O. K. THAT'S IT THE TERRACE WILL BE AWAY UP TO 
LET'S GO BACK TO HOUSE O. K. 
GIVE ME YOUR HAND 
WITH ONLY LIMITED FUNDS AVAILABLE PRITPAL NEEDS TO HAVE THE RESTAURANT OPENED IN JUST FIVE WEEKS 
DESPITE HIS LACK OF EXPERIENCE HE'LL BE OVERSEEING THE BUILDING WORK HIMSELF 
HE'LL BE RELYING HEAVILY ON HIS EX PAT BUILDERS DAVID AND ERIC 
THEY MOVED TO SPAIN FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AGO 
AND ARE WELL QUALIFIED FOR THIS PARTICULAR JOB 
WHAT YOU THINK OF THE RESTAURANTS THAT ARE HERE 
THE INDIAN RESTAURANTS I'D GO DOWN TO GANESH NEAR POPEYE'S 
OH AYE I GO IN THERE BUT IT'S THE ONION BHAJIS ARE FLAT 
YOU KNOW THE WAY PEOPLE LIKE THEM CRISPY O. K. 
AND YOU GET THE CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA BUT IT'S ALWAYS VERY MILD 
IS IT YOU DON'T SEEM TO GET A HOT CURRY NOT A LOT OF GARLIC EITHER 
EVERYBODY LIKES A CURRY DON'T THEY 
ALL THE ENGLISH HERE AS SOON AS THEY HAVE A BEER LET'S GET A CURRY NOW AND NOW THEY CAN 
ESPECIALLY HERE LOTS OF BRITS LIVE HERE DON'T THEY 
THE BUILDERS GET TO WORK 
THEY'VE JUST FOUR WEEKS TO FINISH THE JOB 
MEANWHILE PRITPAL AND THE REST OF HIS FAMILY SET OFF TO EXPLORE THEIR NEW HOME 
PRITPAL'S VISION IS OF A FORTY SEATER RESTAURANT WITH ADDITIONAL SPACES OUTSIDE 
TO BUILD IT HE'S PAYING THE BUILDERS TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EUROS AROUND EIGHT THOUSAND 
MATERIALS WILL COST HIM EXTRA 
TWO WEEKS IN AND EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE GOING TO PLAN 
WELL ALMOST EVERYTHING 
TO OUR SURPRISE WE FOUND OUT THAT 
THERE IS NO SCHOOL 
FIRST OF ALL THERE IS NO SCHOOL PLACES LEFT 
SO WE'RE NOW IN A SITUATION WHERE WE DON'T HAVE 
NO CONFIRMED PLACES FOR ROHAN OR SASHKIA TO START SCHOOL OR DATES 
PRITPAL AND NEELAM HAD BEEN TOLD THAT FINDING SCHOOLS WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM 
IT'S A DISTRACTION PRITPAL DOESN'T NEED 
HE ALREADY HAS HIS HANDS FULL TRYING TO MANAGE A PROJECT AND KEEP IT ON SCHEDULE 
I'VE GOT A CEILING COMING IN 
YEAH THE THING IS 
WHEN 
I DUNNO PROBABLY TWO WEEKS 
TWO WEEKS I NEED TO DO IT QUICKER THAN THAT PLEASE PHONE YEAH I'M GOING QUICKLY 
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU TOMORROW O. K. 
THE LAID BACK SPANISH APPROACH TO LIFE AND DEADLINES IS THREATENING TO BECOME A PROBLEM 
WITH THE END OF THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS LOOMING 
PRITPAL AND NEELAM NEED TO RESOLVE THE SCHOOL SITUATION QUICKLY 
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE 
THEY DECIDE TO INVESTIGATE THE FEE PAYING OPTION 
YOU'LL EITHER BE IN THIS ONE OR THAT ONE 
THEY'RE ALREADY PAYING OUT A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EUROS A MONTH 
FOR THE RESTAURANT THE HOUSE AND THE HIRE CAR 
THE SCHOOL FEES FOR ROHAN AND SASHKIA 
WOULD COME TO AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EUROS A MONTH 
AN EXPENSE WHICH THEY HAVEN'T BUDGETED FOR 
IT'S THE COST ELEMENT OF IT THAT'S ALL IT IS 
IT'S THE COST ELEMENT 
I DON'T WANT TO SEND THEM THERE AND THEN THREE MONTHS DOWN THE LINE 
WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH PAYING THE FEES 
AND HAVING TO PULL THEM OUT AND PUT THEM INTO SCHOOL HERE 
IF YOU ASK ME TO MAKE A DECISION NOW 
I'D SAY JUST GO FOR IT I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY THAT 
WE'LL MANAGE WE'LL MANAGE O. K. 
WE'LL MANAGE 
WORK ON THE RESTAURANT IS COSTING MORE THAN EXPECTED AND PRITPAL NOW 
NEEDS THE TEN THOUSAND LOAN HE APPLIED FOR BEFORE LEAVING THE U. K. 
CAN YOU LOOK IN TO IT AND GET BACK TO ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE PLEASE O. K. THANK YOU BYE BYE 
BUT THERE'S BEEN A MIX UP 
THE BUILDING SOCIETY HASN'T EVEN RECEIVED HIS APPLICATION 
I SPOKE TO THE BUILDING SOCIETY'S MANAGER AND HE'S INFORMED ME THAT 
JUST TWO FAXES WOULD RESOLVE THE SITUATION 
SO HE SAYS HE HAS TO SPEAK TO HIS SECRETARY AND FIND OUT ALL THE FACTS 
AND WHEN HE'S ABLE HE'LL GET BACK TO ME 
THAT WAS IT I MEAN I TOLD HIM THAT I'M NOT HAPPY 
FOR NEELAM THE HOLD UP COMES AS NO SURPRISE 
HE ALWAYS HAS IDEAS AND I'M ALWAYS LIKE 
OH BUT WHAT IF THIS HAPPENS 
I'M ALWAYS THINKING OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE WHERE HE'S ALWAYS MORE POSITIVE 
IT WAS THE SAME WITH THE SCHOOLS WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT 
HE WAS LIKE THEY'LL JUST GO TO THAT SCHOOL IT'LL BE FINE WE'LL MANAGE 
BUT I'M LIKE HOW ARE WE GOING TO MANAGE 
BUT HE JUST THINKS OH GO FOR IT AND SOMEHOW IT'LL HAPPEN 
HOW ARE YOU DOING ALL RIGHT 
ALL RIGHT PRITPAL YEAH HANGING IN O. K. 
O. K. EH 
THERE'S NO PROBLEMS IS THERE 
NO NOTHING MAJOR NOTHING MAJOR UM

THEY SAY BECAUSE OF THE BANKRUPTCY AWAY BACK RIGHT 
AND THE FACT THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE IN THE COUNTRY 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO THEY CAN'T LEND 
WITHOUT THE MONEY FROM THE LOAN 
PRITPAL AND NEELAM'S DREAM OF A RESTAURANT IN THE SUN WILL BE OVER 
IF THEY CAN'T SECURE THE LOAN QUICKLY BUILDING WORK WILL HAVE TO STOP 
HI GOOD EVENING I'M PHONING UP

WITH PRITPAL SPENDING EVERY AVAILABLE MOMENT DOWN AT THE RESTAURANT 
NEELAM AND THE KIDS ARE LEFT TO AMUSE THEMSELVES BACK AT THE HOUSE 
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ROHAN 
PARDON WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT 
WE'VE BEEN HERE NEARLY A MONTH I THINK IT WAS A MONTH YESTERDAY OR SOMETHING 
AND I'M GETTING REALLY BORED I MISS SCHOOL 
AND JUST EVERYBODY THERE MY TEACHERS AND EVERYONE 
I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD MISS THEM BECAUSE WHEN I WENT 
ALL MY FRIENDS WERE CRYING BUT I WAS JUST LIKE OH BYE GOODBYE 
I JUST COULDN'T WAIT TO GET HERE BUT NOW I'M REALLY MISSING THEM 
MUM WAS UPSET SHE WAS CRYING THE OTHER DAY 
YEAH I GOT REALLY UPSET ONCE 
I MISS THEM ALL SO MUCH 
SO FAR THE DREAM IS NOT LIVING UP TO EXPECTATIONS 
IT'S MONDAY MORNING AND PRITPAL IS STILL WAITING FOR THE MONEY TO MAKE IT INTO HIS ACCOUNT 
THE BUILDERS HAVE NOT BEEN PAID FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS 
THEY'RE OWED A TOTAL OF FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EUROS 
WHERE WE LEFT OFF LAST WEEK RIGHT THE MONEY WAS THE MONEY IS HERE 
IS IT AYE O. K. 
YEAH BRILLIANT SO 
WHAT WE AGREED ON FOUR THOUSAND EUROS YEAH 
AND WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GIVE US THE SIX 
WELL ONCE THE JOB'S DONE 
YEAH I MEAN THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH DAVID EH YEAH 
WORK CARRIES ON BUT PRITPAL HAS LOST THE GOODWILL OF THE BUILDERS 
THEY WERE HOPING HE'D REWARD THEIR PATIENCE BY GIVING THEM THE SIX HUNDRED EUROS THEY'RE STILL OWED 
MUCH TO SASHKIA'S RELIEF IT'S THE START OF TERM 
DESPITE THE COST PRITPAL AND NEELAM HAVE DECIDED TO SEND HER TO PRIVATE SCHOOL 
SASHKIA DARAR 
THAT'S IT BYE HAVE A NICE DAY BYE 
YOU'RE NOT CRYING ARE YOU 
NO OTHER PARENTS ARE CRYING APART FROM YOU 
WITH THEIR MONEY FAST RUNNING OUT ROHAN WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR A PLACE AT THE LOCAL STATE SCHOOL 
THE RESTAURANT IS OVER BUDGET AND BEHIND SCHEDULE BUT AT LEAST SASHKIA'S MOOD HAS IMPROVED 
SHE'S HAD A GOOD FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL 
LET'S HEAR YOUR SPANISH 
THEY'D GO COMO ESTA BLAH BLAH BLAH 
COMO ESTAS AND THEN YOU'D GO 
EM FATAL WHICH MEANS TERRIBLE 
AND THEN YOU GO FATAL 
FATAL 
FATAL CLAP YOUR HAND HERE 
FATAL FATAL 
AND THE TEACHER'S LIKE NO NO NO ONTO YOUR FOREHEAD ROHAN 
SEE THIS FATAL 
BACK AT THE UNIT THE ATMOSPHERE IS INCREASINGLY TENSE 
PRITPAL HAS ASKED THE BUILDERS TO DO EXTRA WORK NOT COVERED BY THEIR ORIGINAL QUOTE 
BUT THEY ARE UNSURE WHETHER PRITPAL WILL PAY THEM THE ORIGINAL TWO THOUSAND EUROS 
YOU CAN'T EXPECT US TO BE HERE FOR ANOTHER TWO WEEKS WITHOUT GETTING ANY MONEY NO WAY 
NO BUT YOU TOLD ME LAST MONDAY IT WOULD TAKE YOU NINE DAYS 
YEAH TO FINISH WHAT WE PRICED FOR YEAH 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO WHAT WE'VE SAID 
SO WHEN WE'VE DONE THAT IN THERE THREE CASES TO BE FITTED THAT'S IT 
THEN WE'LL RENEGOTIATE THEN YEAH 
FOR ALL THE EXTRAS 
GIVE US THE SIX HUNDRED EUROS TAKE THE MONEY OUT FOR THE PAINT ALL RIGHT 
GIVE US WHATEVER'S LEFT OF THAT AND THAT'S US UP TO DATE NO YES YES YES 
AND THEN WE'LL RENEGOTIATE FOR ALL THE TILING AND EVERYTHING 
AND ALL THE EXTRAS THEN WE'LL COME BACK 
WE'LL GIVE YOU A PRICE THEN WE'LL START OUR OTHER JOB THEN WE'LL COME BACK WHEN WE CAN TO DO THE EXTRAS 
WE'VE GOT TO START ANOTHER JOB PRITPAL 
WE'RE NOT HAVING ALL THIS MESSING ABOUT THERE'S NO MESSING 
ALL THIS ARGUING OVER MONEY HOLDING MONEY BACK 
WE WANT THE MONEY IT'S AS EASY AS THAT NOBODY WORKS FOR NOTHING YOU KNOW 
PRITPAL AGREES TO GIVE THE BUILDERS THEIR TWO THOUSAND EUROS BUT HE KNOWS NEELAM WILL NOT BE PLEASED 
EVER SINCE THE BANKRUPTCY SHE'S BEEN TERRIFIED OF GETTING INTO DEBT 
I HONESTLY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO END UP BEING A LOT CHEAPER THAN IT'S BEEN ER 
SO WE'VE GONE QUITE A BIT OVER BUDGET 
NO I MEAN GOING BACK BEFORE WE CAME OUT 
WE DID SOME FIGURES ETC 
AND WE BUDGETED AROUND ABOUT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE K. STERLING 
I JUST DON'T LIKE THE THOUGHT OF BEING IN DEBT 
NEELAM WON'T BE HAPPY UNTIL WE'VE CLEARED OUR DEBT AGAIN AND I KNOW THAT 
AND WE'LL BE THERE 
H. M. M. 
YEAH 
HOPEFULLY OF COURSE 
LATER THAT NIGHT PRITPAL AND NEELAM SIT DOWN TO WORK OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH THEY HAVE SPENT 
THE NEWS IS NOT GOOD 
ME AND NEELAM WERE UP LAST NIGHT WORKING OUT THE COSTS AND HOW MUCH WE'VE GOT LEFT TO OPEN UP ETC 
AND WE'VE JUST GONE WAY OVER BUDGET AGAIN 
I TOLD THE BUILDERS I'D PAY THEM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EUROS THIS WEEKEND THIS WEEK 
SO HERE THEY COME SO I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT IT'S JUST THE SPIRALLING BUDGET COSTS ETC 
MORNING GUYS MORNING 
RIGHT LISTEN BEFORE WE START YOU BETTER COME OVER HERE 
ERIC 
RIGHT I WAS UP ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT WORKING OUT MY COSTS 
I CAN'T PAY YOU GUYS THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EUROS UNTIL AFTER I OPEN UP 
IT'S ALL THESE EXTRA COSTS THE CEILING 
DOORS AND JUST BITS AND PIECES 
SO YOU'VE GOT NOTHING AT ALL FOR US 
WHY DID YOU SAY YOU HAD THE OTHER DAY THEN 
WELL I SAT LAST NIGHT I WAS WORKING OUT MY BUDGET 
ESPECIALLY WITH THIS QUOTE I'VE HAD FOR THE CEILING NOW 
THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO DO I'VE GOT NO MONEY FOR YOU LADS 
WHAT DID YOU WANT ME TO SAY WHY DIDN'T YOU EXPLAIN THAT ON MONDAY 
WHEN YOU SAID YOU'D HAVE THE MONEY ON THURSDAY OR FRIDAY MORNING 
I ONLY REALISED THIS LAST NIGHT THAT'S WHY I'M TELLING YOU NOW RATHER THAN FINISHING 
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US LAST NIGHT 
WHY DIDN'T YOU PHONE DAVID LAST NIGHT WHAT AT TWO IN THE MORNING 
WHY DID THE PENNY DROP AT TWO IN THE MORNING 
THE COST OF THE CEILING I WORKED OUT ALL MY FIGURES 
WHAT SO THE CEILING HAS TOOK THE LOT 
IT'S THE STOCK AND ALL THAT I'LL HAVE TO BUY AS WELL 
YOU'VE NOT BEEN HONEST WITH US PRITPAL THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T LOOK ME IN THE FACE 
I AM LOOKING AT YOU IN THE FACE NO YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HONEST 
THAT'S THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO NOT BE HONEST 
I'VE HAD FOUR WEEKS AND NOTHING BUT AGGRAVATION FROM YOU 
THE BUILDERS DECIDE THAT UNLESS PRITPAL GIVES THEM ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EUROS THEY'LL WALK OFF THE JOB 
HELLO 
OH IT'S DOING MY HEAD IN BABES 
THEY'RE SAYING GIVE US ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND WE'LL GET THE JOB DONE 
BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT ON ME JUST NOW 
THEY WANT IT NOW BEFORE THEY START WORK 
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY NEED TO GO IN WITH YOUR CARD BUT HOW MUCH ARE YOU ALLOWED 
ALL RIGHT HONEY BYE 
THERE YOU GO GORDON FOR YOU 
THANK YOU PRITPAL O. K. THANK YOU 
PRITPAL AND NEELAM ARE UP TO THE LIMIT ON ALL THEIR CREDIT CARDS 
THEY HAVE NO MORE MONEY AND NEED TO BE OPEN AND EARNING WITHIN A WEEK 
YEAH THE BUILDERS ARE SORTED OUT AND 
I'VE JUST GONE OFF THEM COMPLETELY 
I DON'T FEEL LIKE TALKING TO THEM EITHER 
IT'S THE BUILDERS' LAST DAY ON THE JOB 
THE RESTAURANT IS TEN DAYS BEHIND SCHEDULE BUT AT LEAST WORK CAN NOW START ON THE CEILING 
O. K. WELL THANKS A LOT 
THANK YOU O. K. ERIC YEAH 
JOB WELL DONE O. K. YEP 
I'LL BE IN TOUCH OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND THAT O. K. NO PROBLEM 
ALL RIGHT SEE YOU LATER ON THEN O. K. SEE YOU 
IT'S FINISHED THAT'S IT WE'RE OFF 
GOOD RIDDANCE CHEERS LADS SPOT ON TO ALL OUR HARD WORK 
SEVEN WEEKS AFTER ARRIVING IN SPAIN AND TWO BEHIND SCHEDULE 
PRITPAL AND NEELAM ARE FINALLY READY TO OPEN THEIR RESTAURANT IN THE SUN 
IN ALL IT'S COST THEM FIFTY THOUSAND TWICE WHAT THEY INTENDED 
BUT AT LEAST THEY CAN NOW LOOK FORWARD TO EARNING SOME MONEY 
THE QUESTION IS WILL ANYONE TURN UP 
WITH AN AVERAGE MEAL COSTING FIFTEEN EUROS PRITPAL NEEDS AT LEAST FORTY CUSTOMERS A NIGHT TO BREAK EVEN 
ALTHOUGH SHE'S NEVER DONE IT BEFORE NEELAM IS GOING TO HELP OUT AS AN EXTRA WAITRESS 
HOT MEDIUM MEDIUM 
YEAH IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK IN BUSINESS AGAIN 
IT'S GREAT TO GET A DECENT MEAL A SCOTTISH ONE FROM AN INDIAN 
SUPERB 
THE LAST CUSTOMERS LEAVE AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY 
IT'S BEEN A GOOD NIGHT BUT HAS IT BEEN A PROFITABLE ONE 
ONE THOUSAND FORTY IS THAT ALL 
YOU WERE ONLY OPEN FIVE HOURS SIX HOURS 
IS THAT ALL IS THAT ALL HE SAYS IS THAT IT 
IS THAT JUST THE DRINKS HUH WHERE'S THE FOOD 
TOLD YOU I'D DO IT I KNOW I KNOW 
TOLD YOU I WOULD DO IT EH 
BY THE END OF DIVA'S FIRST SEASON PRITPAL HAS CLEARED HIS DEBTS 
TAKEN ON EIGHT STAFF AND EXPANDED ON TO THE TERRACE WITH FIFTY NEW SEATS 
SO I CAN'T COMPLAIN IT HAS BEEN GOOD 
BUT HIS SUCCESS HAS BEEN HARD EARNED 
AFTER SEVEN MONTHS IN BUSINESS PRITPAL'S STILL WAITING FOR HIS FIRST DAY OFF 
YEAH SINCE I'VE BEEN OPEN I'VE BEEN WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK 
AND I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD TIME TO TAKE OFF 
BUT I'M HOPEFUL IN THE FUTURE THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS 
THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE TIME OFF 
I'M TRAINING THE STAFF UP SO 
HOPEFULLY I'LL BE IN A POSITION IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS 
UNTIL PRITPAL CAN TRUST HIS STAFF 
NEELAM SASHKIA AND ROHAN CONTINUE TO SPEND THEIR EVENINGS ALONE 
PRITPAL WOULD LOVE TO BE HERE HE'D BE RIGHT IN THERE 
HE'S JUST A KID AT HEART HE'D LOVE IT 
HE FEELS HE'S MISSING OUT AS WELL ACTUALLY COS HE WOULD LIKE TO DO ALL THIS WITH THE KIDS AS WELL 
BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE 
THE HARDEST THING I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH IS NOT WORKING SEVEN DAYS 
IT'S THE FACT THAT I'VE GOT TO THINK AHEAD AND TRAIN THE STAFF 
AND MAKE SURE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
SO I CAN GET PEACE OF MIND WHEN I TAKE A DAY OFF 
THE FAMILY CAN FINALLY CALL SPAIN HOME 
AS THEY MOVE INTO THEIR NEW HOUSE IN DEHESA DE CAMPOAMOR 
JUST TEN MINUTES FROM DIVA 
FOR THE LAST YEAR PRITPAL HAS WORKED EVERY SINGLE DAY 
BUT TOMORROW IT'S SASHKIA'S BIRTHDAY 
PRITPAL'S GOING TO TAKE HIS FIRST DAY OFF 
I WON'T BE ON STANDBY AT ALL 
I DON'T PLAN TO GO INTO WORK AT ALL TOMORROW OR ANYTHING 
NO PHONE CALLS OR NOTHING TOMORROW 
IT'LL BE A DAY OFF TOTALLY FROM WORK 
IT'LL BE GREAT TO HAVE PRITPAL HOME FOR THE WHOLE DAY 
SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE FAMILY 
SO WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS 
USUALLY YOU SAY EMMA HAS TO DEAL WITH IT 
AND THEN SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT SO WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT 
HOPEFULLY NOTHING LIKE THAT WILL HAPPEN 
IF THERE'S A COMPLAINT OUTSIDE EMMA WILL DEAL WITH IT LIKE SHE ALWAYS DOES 
YEAH BUT SOMETIMES SHE HAS TO CALL YOU BUT SHE WON'T 
USUALLY WHEN YOU'RE THERE SOMETIMES SHE HAS TO SAY PRITPAL CAN YOU COME OUT 
THAT WON'T HAPPEN SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT HERSELF 
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT HERSELF 
FOR YOUR FIRST NIGHT OFF FIRST NIGHT OFF 
MEANWHILE FOR THE FIRST TIME WITHOUT PRITPAL THE NIGHT AT THE RESTAURANT BEGINS 
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO SIT DOWN FOR THEIR MEAL AND AN HOUR LATER 
THEY'RE STILL WAITING FOR THEIR MEAL TO GO OUT 
IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE IN THE PAST BUT THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE HAD BIG TABLES IN HASN'T IT 
AND THERE'S BEEN NO STARTERS 
THAT'S THE WORST SCENARIO THAT MIGHT HAPPEN 
THANK YOU 
I TOLD HER I DIDN'T WANT IT TO RING TODAY 
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO RING TODAY 
HELLO 
O. K. BYE 
I WAS EXPECTING A DELIVERY IN TODAY SO I HAD TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR SOMEONE TO BE THERE 
AND THAT WAS MAJEED THAT WAS THERE 
SO HE JUST ASKED ME IF THAT'S ALL THAT'S COMING IN 
I SAID YEAH THAT'S ALL SO THAT'S O. K. 
IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME 
SHOULD COME MORE OFTEN 
STOP IT WHAT DO YOU MEAN STOP IT BEHAVE YOURSELF 
STOP EMBARRASSING ME 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR SASHKIA 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU 
WE ALL WANT SOME 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN COVERS LATER THE STAFF HAVE PULLED OUT THE STOPS FOR PRITPAL 
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL NIGHT 
BEST NOT BE 
GOOD EVENING DIVA RESTAURANT EMMA SPEAKING HOW MANY I HELP YOU 
CAN I MAKE A RESERVATION PLEASE 
YOU WANT TO MAKE A RESERVATION WHEN FOR SIR 
I KNEW YOU COULDN'T LAST 
I BET YOU'VE BEEN SAT THERE THINKING OH MY GOD ARE THEY ALL RIGHT 
YOUR RESTAURANT IS STILL STANDING STILL THERE 
THE KITCHEN BOYS ARE ABSOLUTELY OVER THE MOON MADE UP COS THEY COPED 
FANTASTIC WELL DONE THANKS A LOT 
I'LL SPEAK TO YOU TOMORROW YEAH TAKE CARE BYE 
SHE SAID EVERYONE WAS HAPPY AND STUFF 
SO VERY GOOD 
WHEN'S YOUR NEXT DAY OFF 
NEXT DAY OFF NEXT YEAR 
NO NO HOPEFULLY IT'LL BE MORE REGULARLY NOW YEAH 
PRITPAL NOW TAKES TWO DAYS OFF EVERY WEEK TO SPEND WITH NEELAM SASHKIA AND ROHAN 
BUT HE'S ALREADY DREAMING ABOUT HIS NEXT VENTURE 
IT'S FIVE YEARS ON AND PRITPAL AND HIS FAMILY 
ARE STILL LIVING IN THE AFFLUENT SPANISH SUBURB OF DEHESA DE CAMPOAMOR 
THE DARARS ARE VERY MUCH SETTLED INTO THE LOCAL SPANISH WAY OF LIFE 
SOMETIMES IF I MEET SOMEONE FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY DON'T REALISE I'M NOT SPANISH 
AND THEN AFTER ABOUT TEN MINUTES THEY'LL BE LIKE YOU'RE NOT SPANISH ARE YOU 
NO WHERE ARE YOU FROM YOU SPEAK SUCH GOOD SPANISH 
ALL THE SPANISH THAT I SPEAK IS JUST THROUGH MY CONTACTS THROUGH MY SUPPLIERS DAY IN DAY OUT 
THAT'S THE ONLY SPANISH ALL THE STAFF YOU'VE GOT 
THEY PICKED IT UP WITHIN A YEAR DIDN'T THEY BECAUSE 
IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH YOU CAN PICK UP SO QUICK 
IF YOU MOVE TO SPAIN YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO SPEAK SPANISH 
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE AN EFFORT AND FOR ME PERSONALLY 
I THINK IN ORDER FOR ME TO ESTABLISH AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESS 
I HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK SPANISH BETTER IN ORDER FOR ME TO ADVANCE 
BOTH SASHKIA AND ROHAN ARE STILL STUDYING AT THEIR PRIVATE SCHOOL IN THE NEARBY TOWN OF MURCIA 
SASHKIA IS TAKING THE SPANISH BACCALAUREAT AND HOPES TO STUDY MEDICINE AT A SPANISH UNIVERSITY 
I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT SPAIN' 
I LIKE THE PEOPLE 
I LIKE THE CLIMATE I LIKE THE BEACH 
I LOVE THE WEATHER EVERYTHING 
BUT I LOVE THE PEOPLE THE MOST BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST SO FRIENDLY 
WHEN I THINK OF BRITAIN IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD I DON'T FEEL THAT I BELONG THERE ANYMORE 
IT FEELS AS IF IT WAS SO LONG AGO THAT I WAS THERE 
AND HOW MUCH I'VE CHANGED SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE 
THE FAMILY'S INDIAN RESTAURANT DIVA IS STILL DOING WELL 
PRITPAL HAS REPLACED HIS OLD MANAGER EMMA WITH FORMER WAITRESS ELAINE 
ELAINE'S DOING A FANTASTIC JOB 
SHE KNOWS WHAT I EXPECT FROM HER AND SHE DOES SHE DELIVERS TIME AND TIME AGAIN 
HE HAS TRUSTWORTHY STAFF THAT HAVE BEEN WITH HIM FROM THE START WORKING IN THE KITCHEN 
AND NOW PRITPAL ONLY NEEDS TO VISIT DIVA EVERY TWO WEEKS 
TO DISCUSS THE ACCOUNTS AND GENERAL RUNNING OF THE RESTAURANT WITH ELAINE 
PRITPAL'S MELLOWED OVER THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS REALLY 
HE LISTENS MORE 
HE'S ALWAYS THERE IF YOU NEED HIM AT THE END OF A TELEPHONE 
IS THAT BETTER THAN LAST YEAR YEAH 
ALL HIS HARD WORK HAS PAID OFF AND THE PLACE IS VIRTUALLY RUNNING ITSELF 
I THINK WHEN WE FIRST MOVED OUT WE JUST CAME OUT TO OPEN A RESTAURANT 
AND THAT'S WHAT WAS ALWAYS ON OUR MIND JUST TO OPEN UP A RESTAURANT 
GET THE CHILDREN SETTLED INTO SCHOOL AND HOPEFULLY THEY CAN DO WELL 
BUT ONCE YOU DO THAT THE BAR GETS RAISED HIGHER 
AND YOU THINK O. K. YOU'VE DONE THAT BUT NOW WHAT 
I THINK THE NATURAL PROGRESSION WAS TO EXPAND 
WHAT MOTIVATES ME IS JUST WHEN I SEE AN OPPORTUNITY I'LL IDENTIFY IT 
I'VE ALWAYS GONE WITH MY INSTINCTS AND NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN I'M PRETTY MUCH CORRECT 
HAVING ACHIEVED HIS DREAM OF OPENING AN INDIAN RESTAURANT IN SPAIN 
PRITPAL HAS RECENTLY OPENED A NEW INTERNATIONAL RESTAURANT 
IN THE AFFLUENT RESORT OF LOS ALCAZARES TWENTY KILOMETRES DOWN THE COAST 
HE WAS QUICK TO SPOT THE POTENTIAL OF THE AREA 
TWO FOUR STAR HOTELS WITHIN ONE HUNDRED M. OF EACH OTHER 
AND THE TWO STREETS BEHIND THEY'RE BUILDING LIKE AN AUDITORIUM 
THAT'S GOING TO BE FOR PARTY POLITICAL CONFERENCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
SO AGAIN IMMEDIATELY I SAW THE POTENTIAL AND I THOUGHT O. K. 
I WANT TO GO SLIGHTLY UPMARKET A BIT AND JUST CATER FOR THAT CLIENTELE 
I FELT WITH MY EXPERIENCE I COULD DO IT YOU KNOW I COULD DO IT 
THIRTY THREE 
THIRTY THREE'S THIS ONE SPANISH TABLE 
WE'VE GOT ITALIAN FOOD WE'VE GOT MEDITERRANEAN FOOD 
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF SPANISH FOOD AS WELL 
WE'VE GOT INDIAN FOOD WE'VE GOT MALAYSIAN FOOD 
WE'VE GOT THAI FOOD WE'VE GOT MEXICAN FOOD 
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE A FUSION OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD 
PRITPAL EMBARKED ON LA DIVA HOPING TO AVOID HIS PREVIOUS PITFALLS 
BASICALLY I APPROACHED THE MAIN CONTRACTOR 
I SAID THIS IS WHAT I WANT AND YOU DO IT AND THAT'S IT 
THAT'S WHAT I DID I THOUGHT IT'LL BE EASIER FOR ME 
WHAT HE HADN'T BARGAINED FOR WAS THE CONTRACTOR FINISHING THE RESTAURANT FIVE MONTHS LATE 
AND WITHOUT ALL THE PAPERWORK IN PLACE 
WE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE TOWN HALL AND THE PAPERWORK 
AND IN THE SUMMER EVERYONE TAKES THEIR HOLIDAYS 
AND YOU CAN'T GET THINGS DONE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT 
I DON'T HAVE MY OWN WATER SUPPLY YET 
I'VE HAD TO RESORT TO SPEAKING TO ONE OF MY NEIGHBOURS 
SO BASICALLY I'M PAYING HIM FOR THE USE OF HIS WATER AS WELL 
WHICH IS NOT AN IDEAL SITUATION IT'S NOT 
WE WERE FIVE MONTHS LATE IN OPENING 
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT HAD QUITE A DRAMATIC EFFECT ON US AS A FAMILY 
WHAT I'VE FOUND IS WE'VE OPENED ONE RESTAURANT 
IT JUST SETTLES DOWN AND THEN HE'S KEEN TO DO SOMETHING ELSE 
I JUST WANT WHEN WE'VE GOT TIME TO OURSELVES AND WE CAN RELAX 
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BUSINESS 
I'M MORE KEEN ON INVESTING IN PROPERTY BECAUSE BASICALLY 
YOU BUY THE PROPERTY AND IT'S LESS OF A HEADACHE 
ALTHOUGH WE WENT THROUGH A LOT OPENING THE SECOND ONE IT WAS DIFFERENT TO THE FIRST ONE 
WE WENT THROUGH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
AS THE DUST SETTLES AGAIN FOR THE SECOND ONE NEELAM'S SAYING 
NEVER AGAIN WE'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN BUT 
I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP SOMETHING ELSE I WOULD 
BUT IT'S CONVINCING NEELAM I WOULDN'T DO IT IF NEELAM SAID NO 
I WOULDN'T DO IT IF NEELAM CATEGORICALLY SAID NO SHE DOESN'T WANT IT 
SHE'S SAYING NO NOW BUT AS THE DUST SETTLES SHE COULD CHANGE HER MIND 
I'LL PERSUADE HER TO CHANGE HER MIND 
IF YOU WANTED TO OPEN ANOTHER RESTAURANT I'D LIKE THAT 
I WOULDN'T STOP THEM I DON'T MIND IF THEY WANT TO IT'S FINE 
SOMETHING DEEP DOWN IN ME IS WANTING ME TO OPEN UP A CHAIN OF RESTAURANTS 
BUT FOR NOW NOT HAVING A WATER LICENCE AT LA DIVA 
MEANS PRITPAL AND NEELAM LIVE IN FEAR OF BEING CLOSED DOWN BY LOCAL COUNCIL INVESTIGATORS 
THIS IS WHAT OUR NEELAM AND I.'S BIGGEST CONCERN IS 
THE FACT THAT A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE TOWN HALL CAN COME IN AT ANY TIME AND ASK FOR ALL MY PAPERWORK 
THEY CAN COME AND SAY SHOW ME THIS AND WE WON'T HAVE IT 
EVERY TIME I HEAR SOMETHING I JUST AUTOMATICALLY GLANCE OUT THE WINDOW 
DO WE HAVE STAFF COMING IN NO 
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE TEMPORARY WATER SUPPLY IS ONLY AVAILABLE AT NIGHT WHEN THE RESTAURANT IS OPEN 
EVEN THOUGH PRITPAL APPLIED FOR HIS LICENCE TWO YEARS AGO 
WELL BEFORE OPENING HE'S STILL NO NEARER TO GETTING IT 
SPAIN'S GREAT TO DO BUSINESS IN BUT EVERYBODY WILL SAY THE SAME 
IT'S JUST MANANA MANANA AND IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER 
I THINK WHERE WE ARE JUST NOW THE MAR MENOR AREA IT'S A SMALL TOWN MENTALITY HERE 
IT'S FRUSTRATING AT TIMES IT IS FRUSTRATING 
WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IS THAT THERE'S NO POINT SHOUTING AT THEM 
OR DOING ANYTHING OR SHOWING YOUR ANGER TOWARDS THEM 
BECAUSE THEY'LL JUST BLANK YOU OUT AND THAT'S IT 
PRITPAL HAS BEEN ADVISED TO USE A LAWYER TO DEAL WITH HIS WATER PROBLEMS 
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET IT RESOLVED FAIRLY SOON 
I'VE GOT A MEETING WITH MY LAWYER HE'S ON HOLIDAY JUST NOW 
SO HE COMES BACK NEXT MONTH 
AND I'LL BE URGING HIM TO GET IT DONE VERY VERY QUICKLY 
WHILE THE SMALL TOWN MENTALITY CONTINUES TO FRUSTRATE PRITPAL 
THE BRIGHT CITY LIGHTS AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES OF BARCELONA ARE A WELCOME DISTRACTION 
PRITPAL MANAGES TO PERSUADE NEELAM TO ACCOMPANY HIM ON ONE OF HIS RESTAURANT SCOUTING TRIPS 
I'VE BEEN TO BARCELONA THREE TIMES IN THE LAST FOURTEEN MONTHS 
AND EVERY TIME I GO I JUST GET EVEN MORE EXCITED ABOUT IT 
AH LOOK AT IT 
WOW LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT AND THEY'VE BOILED IT IN WATER WOW 
IT'S HORRIBLE 
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE 
PRITPAL LOOK 
WOW IT'S SO NICE HAVE YOU EVER TRIED ONE OF THESE 
NEVER 
MINI AVOCADOS 
NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE NEVER SEEN THEM WOW 
SO MUCH CHOICE YOU NEVER SEE IT HERE 
IT'S LIKE A GREEN 
EVEN THE GREEN CHILLIES ARE DIFFICULT TO GET WHERE WE ARE 
INDIAN FOODS SOME OF THE DISHES ARE QUITE SPICY AND YOU USE GREEN CHILLIES 
I CAN NEVER GET A GOOD STRONG GREEN CHILLI THERE 
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT ALL THIS VARIETY AGAIN YOU CAN DO SO MUCH 
AND IT'S REALLY AMAZING IT REALLY IS 
IT GETS ME EXCITED 
THEY'RE COCONUTS 
DOS CAFE CON LECHE DOS CAFE CON LECHE 
GRACIAS 
THERE'S JUST THE TENSION AGAIN OF STARTING UP SOMEWHERE ELSE AGAIN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
PRITPAL WOULD SAY I'M PESSIMISTIC 
I ALWAYS SAY I'M NOT I'M REALISTIC MORE THAN PESSIMISTIC 
HE'S ALWAYS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT EVERYTHING HE NEVER THINKS THAT ANYTHING CAN GO WRONG 
I THINK I CAN APPLY MY EXPERIENCE AND NEELAM'S AS WELL YOU KNOW 
HERE PUT IT TO GOOD USE GET A NICE LOCATION GET IT SET UP 
SIMILAR TO LA DIVA IF NOT BETTER 
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANY INGREDIENTS GOT EVERYTHING HERE 
STAFF I DON'T THINK I'LL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH 
AND THAT'S HALF OF THE BATTLE AND THEN THAT'S IT SO 
IT'S APPEALING IT'S VERY APPEALING 
EVERY TIME YOU OPEN A BUSINESS IN SPAIN THERE'S A LOT OF PAPERWORK 
THERE'S A LOT OF HEADACHE AND IT TAKES A LOT OF YOUR TIME 
THEN HE HAS TO START WORKING IN THE RESTAURANT TRAINING UP STAFF AGAIN 
IT CAUSES A LOT OF TENSION 
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH FREE TIME 
NEELAM'S HAD SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT AGAIN 
BUT SHE SAID THAT AFTER THE FIRST TIME AS WELL 
YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP A CHAIN I WOULD 
BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE GOT A FORMULA THAT WORKS 
I'VE ALWAYS SEEN THE POTENTIAL THAT'S THE THING 
AND I KNOW IF WE DID HAVE A RESTAURANT HERE IT WOULD DO REALLY WELL 
BUT IT'S JUST THE HASSLE OF IT 
THAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT 
PRITPAL RETURNS TO SOME BAD NEWS 
HIS NEIGHBOUR WHO'S BEEN SUPPLYING LA DIVA WITH ITS TEMPORARY WATER SUPPLY 
HAS DECIDED IT'S TOO RISKY TO CONTINUE 
AT THE END OF THEIR SHIFT HE HAS TO TELL NEELAM WHAT'S GOING ON 
HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO STOP THE WATER 
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM 
I SAID I'M TRYING TO GET IT RESOLVED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH THE TOWN HALL 
BUT HE SAID IT'S TOO RISKY 
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE SITUATION RIGHT REGARDING THE TOWN HALL 
SO TO HIM ALTHOUGH HE'S HELPED US OUT 
HE 
FEELS THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO ANY MORE 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO HELP US OUT WITH THE WATER ANY MORE 
THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE WE CAN GET IT I KNOW THAT'S WHY I NEED IT DONE THIS WEEK 
I CAN MAYBE STRETCH HIM OUT FOR ANOTHER WEEK 
THAT'S WHY I NEED TO GET IT DONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THIS WEEK 
I KNOW NEELAM IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THIS WEEK I KNOW THAT 
BUT LIKE I SAY I CAN MAYBE GET ANOTHER 
WEEK OUT OF HIM OR SOMETHING 
THIS IS DEFINITE THAT'S IT 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT HE SAID 
WHY IS IT ALL OF A SUDDEN GOING TO BE RISKY I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW 
LA DIVA HAS A MONTHLY TURNOVER OF TWENTY TWO THOUSAND 
IF HIS NEIGHBOUR CARRIES OUT HIS THREAT 
PRITPAL WILL HAVE TO CLOSE THE RESTAURANT 
WITH A HUGE LOSS OF INCOME TO THE BUSINESS AND HIS FAMILY 
JUST NOW WE'RE OPERATING WITH A TEMPORARY SUPPLY OF WATER 
IT'S NOT AN IDEAL SITUATION IT'S NOT THE WAY I WOULD LIKE TO RUN A BUSINESS 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW I'VE GOT MOUTHS TO FEED 
I'VE GOT SCHOOL FEES TO PAY A MORTGAGE TO PAY 
THIS IS CAUSING ME TOO MUCH STRESS 
NEELAM AS WELL IT'S CAUSING US BOTH STRESS 
I NEED MY WATER CERTIFICATE SORTED OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
THE DAY AFTER HEARING THE BAD NEWS FROM HIS NEIGHBOUR 
PRITPAL GOES TO SEE JOSE CARLOS HIS LAWYER 
I WILL BE KICKING ASS I'LL TELL HIM THAT I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING AND GET SOMETHING DONE 
I WANT TO SEE SOME RESULTS 
JOSE CARLOS HAS BEEN WORKING ON PRITPAL'S CASE FOR SIX MONTHS NOW BUT IS A DIFFICULT MAN TO PIN DOWN 
ANSWERPHONE MESSAGE IN SPANISH

THE FOLLOWING DAY THE ELUSIVE JOSE CARLOS IS BACK IN HIS LOS ALCAZARES OFFICE 
AND WITH JUST DAYS TO GO BEFORE THE NEIGHBOUR'S DEADLINE 
PRITPAL AND NEELAM FINALLY GET THEIR MEETING 
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN NO DECISION 
WE'RE ASSUMING THEY WANT OTHER INFORMATION BUT WHAT 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT 
THE ENGINEER HAS SPOKEN TO THEM AND HE SAID HE PROVIDED THEM EVERYTHING THEY WANTED EVERYTHING 
I'LL PAY YOU WHATEVER IT COSTS I WANT YOU TO GO TO THE TOWN HALL 
EVERY DAY IF YOU HAVE TO AND GET THIS THING SORTED OUT 
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH IT COSTS I NEED IT SORTED OUT CARLOS PLEASE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PROBLEM IS 
IN YOUR OPINION WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WHY ARE THEY NOT GIVING US THE DECISION WHY 
THE FIRST THING IS THE HOLIDAYS 
AND THE SECOND IS THE WORK O. K. 
IT'S BEEN NEARLY TWO YEARS 
YES I KNOW YOU CAN'T HAVE HOLIDAYS FOR TWO YEARS 
THAT CAN'T BE YOUR EXCUSE YOU KNOW THE TOWN HALL MUST ANSWER YOU 
THIS IS WHAT THE LAW SAYS 
IN THREE MONTHS NOT MUCH MORE TIME 
BUT THE LAW GIVES YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO THE COURT 
AFTER THREE MONTHS AFTER THREE MONTHS O. K. 
BUT TAKING THE TOWN HALL TO THE COURT IT COULD TAKE ONE TWO YEARS OR SOMETHING 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT NO MORE OR LESS 
POINTLESS IT'S POINTLESS TAKING THE TOWN HALL TO THE COURT YOU KNOW 
THERE IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY'RE FOREIGN PEOPLE 
BECAUSE ALL THE COURTS ARE COLLAPSING 
THERE ARE A LOT OF CASES AND THIS TAKES A LOT OF TIME 
BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP OUR SITUATION IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING 
O. K. JOSE CARLOS YOU PHONE THE TECHNICIAN OR SOMEBODY IN THE TOWN HALL TODAY AND FIND OUT 
WE HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE TECHNICIAN TOMORROW O. K. 
WE HAVE TO SPEAK TO THEM TOMORROW O. K. O. K. 
SO YOU PHONE ME TO LET ME KNOW WHAT TIME YEAH O. K. O. K. 
ALL RIGHT O. K. THEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IF THE TEMPORARY SUPPLY I'VE GOT IS ONLY FOR ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR DAYS 
IF THE WORST COMES TO THE WORST I MIGHT HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN 
IT'S NOT THE IDEAL SITUATION TO DO 
BECAUSE THEN I HAVE TO LAY OFF PEOPLE 
IT'S JUST UNNECESSARY STRESS THAT IT'S GOING TO CAUSE 
PRITPAL AND NEELAM NEVER HEARD FROM JOSE CARLOS AGAIN 
YEAH I THINK IF YOU'RE RUNNING A BUSINESS HERE 
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE SPANISH AUTHORITIES YOU HAVE TO COME TO THEIR WAY OF THINKING 
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU GET THINGS DONE HERE 
IT'S DIFFERENT IN THE U. K. 
WHEN YOU'RE HERE IT'S EITHER THE SPANISH WAY OR NO WAY AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS HERE 
ALL THE PITFALLS THAT COME OF OPENING A BUSINESS A RESTAURANT 
BY FAR THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST STRESSFUL 
JUST THIS ONE INCIDENT REGARDING THE WATER HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST STRESSFUL 
PRITPAL DECIDES TO VISIT THE TOWN HALL YET AGAIN 
IT'S HIS TWENTIETH VISIT 
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF COMING HERE AND TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT IT'S BEEN SO LONG 
YOU KNOW BASICALLY ALL I WANT IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD ANSWER 
I'VE JUST PROVIDED YOU WITH ALL THE INFORMATION YOU'VE EVER WANTED 
BUT THEY JUST TAKE SO LONG COMING ROUND TO IT AND GIVING YOU A DECISION 
BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S SPAIN FOR YOU 
PRITPAL HAS BROUGHT ALONG ONE OF HIS WAITERS JANEL WHO SPEAKS GOOD SPANISH 
WHAT I'M WAITING FOR IS ONE PIECE OF PAPER WITH AN OFFICIAL STAMP ON IT THAT'S ALL I'M WAITING FOR 
THE PERSON WHO ISSUES THE STAMP 
HE ONLY WORKS ONE MORNING ONE DAY A WEEK THAT'S ALL HE WORKS 
I JUST DON'T NEED IT I JUST DON'T NEED IT
