WHO WERE THE ROMANS WHY DID THEY COME TO BRITAIN 
DID THEY HAVE A BIG EMPIRE WERE THEY POWERFUL 
IS ANYBODY SITTING THERE 
NO GO AHEAD 
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO 
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
AH SO AM I 
MAYBE YOU COULD TAG ALONG WITH ME ROMULUS THE ROMAN 
MASTER TRADER AND GOOD BLOKE 
CALL ME ROM MOST PEOPLE DO I MIGHT'VE KNOWN 
ANOTHER ROMAN TRYING TO TAKE OVER 
HUH COLIN THE CELT 
BRAVE WARRIOR AND NOBODY'S FOOL 
AND MAY I REMIND YOU I WAS HERE FIRST 
YEAH I KNOW I WASN'T TRYING TO MUSCLE IN THAT MAKES A CHANGE 
THAT'S WHAT YOU ROMANS USUALLY DO 
THAT'S WHAT YOU DID WHEN YOU INVADED BRITAIN 
OH COME ON WE DID A LOT OF GOOD TOO 
WE BROUGHT ORDER AND DISCIPLINE AND SMARTENED THINGS UP 
AND SOME OF YOU NEEDED SMARTENING UP 
WELL I DON'T NEED ANYTHING FROM YOU TODAY 
AND I'M GOING TO TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BRITAIN 
BY MYSELF HAH DRESSED LIKE THAT ALL THAT MUCK ON YOUR FACE 
YOU'LL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE 
MUCK IT'S NOT MUCK IT'S WAR PAINT 
AND FRIGHTENING PEOPLE'S THE POINT 
WE SCARED OFF YOU ROMANS A FEW TIMES 
YES WELL IT'S NOT WORKING NOW IS IT 
CLOSE UP IT JUST LOOKS SILLY 
ON YOUR OWN 
YOU'RE NOT SO SCARY EITHER 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FOR 
SEE IF THERE ARE STILL SIGNS OF US CELTS 
YOU'LL BE LUCKY THERE'LL BE FAR MORE SIGNS OF US ROMANS 
HOW DO YOU KNOW COME WITH ME AND FIND OUT SEE 
I KNEW YOU'D TRY AND TAKE OVER COR 
NEXT STOP TWENTY FIRST CENTURY MIND THE TIME GAP 
WHERE HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME DOESN'T LOOK VERY CELTIC 
IT'S NOT WE'RE IN THE MODERN PORT OF DOVER 
KNOWN IN ROMAN TIMES AS DUBRIS 
WE'LL START IN THE SOUTH OF BRITAIN WHERE WE ROMANS FIRST LANDED 
BUT WHY HAVEN'T WE ARRIVED SOMEWHERE CELTIC 
WE CELTS WERE IN BRITAIN BEFORE YOU 
I KNOW LIKE I KEEP SAYING 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND SIGNS OF YOU CELTS 
MIGHT AS WELL STICK WITH ME SEE SOME ROMAN SITES INSTEAD 
LIKE THAT FANTASTIC LIGHTHOUSE 
CALLED A PHAROS IN ROMAN TIMES 
IT'S THE TALLEST REMAINING ROMAN BUILDING IN TWENTY ONE C. BRITAIN 
I THOUGHT WE'D START WITH SOMETHING IMPRESSIVE SEEN BETTER DAYS 
IT'S TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD IS THAT 
THERE WERE TWO OF THEM IN ROMAN TIMES THEY HAD TO BE TALL 
SO SAILORS COULD SEE THE FLAMES BURNING ON THE TOP ON A CLEAR DAY 
YOU COULD SEE FRANCE FROM HERE 
KNOWN AS GAUL IN THOSE DAYS YES COLIN IT WAS 
WELL DONE NOW 
THIS WAS A MAGNIFICENT SPOT FOR OUR PHAROS AND GENERATIONS AFTER US 
BUILT AN ENTIRE CASTLE AROUND IT 
DOVER WAS A GREAT PORT 
IT WAS FULL OF HUSTLE AND BUSTLE 
AND IT STILL IS 
WE KNEW A GOOD SPOT WHEN WE SAW ONE 
EXCEPT FOR JULIUS CAESAR YEAH WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
WELL HE CAME TO BRITAIN IN AND TOTALLY MISSED DOVER 
PERHAPS HIS EYESIGHT WASN'T SO GOOD IN THOSE DAYS 
I I BEG YOUR PARDON HOW DARE YOU 
CRITICISE THE GREAT CAESAR 
HE WAS BRAVE AND CLEVER AND STRONG 
AND TALENTED AND NOT GOOD AT FINDING A PARKING SPACE 
COME ON 
HEY COLIN 
WHO WAS JULIUS CAESAR WHY DID HE COME TO BRITAIN 
LOOK THIS IS WHERE JULIUS CAESAR LANDED 
ON THIS STONY BEACH AT WALMER IN KENT ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM DOVER 
DON'T BELIEVE YOU HOW DO YOU KNOW 
I KNOW BECAUSE WE CELTS WEREN'T TOO FAR AWAY 
WE WERE WARNED HE WAS COMING BY THE CELTIC TRIBES WE KNEW IN GAUL 
SO WE COVERED OURSELVES IN WAR PAINT AND WAITED FOR HIM 
OH WE LOOKED PRETTY FIERCE 
WELL YOU DIDN'T FRIGHTEN HIM AWAY 
NOT AT FIRST 
BUT WE WERE BRAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE HIM ON 
AND HE HAD TEN THOUSAND MEN AND FIVE HUNDRED CAVALRY 
THE STORMS FINISHED HIM OFF THE STORMS FINISHED HIM OFF 
CAESAR WOULDN'T BE BOTHERED BY BAD WEATHER MAYBE NOT AS A RULE 
BUT HE WAS WHEN HIS SHIPS STUCK IN THIS SHINGLE 
YOU SEE CAESAR AND HIS ARMY DIDN'T LAND AT A PROPER HARBOUR 
SO IN THE STORMS HIS SHIPS WEREN'T PROTECTED AND GOT DAMAGED 
THAT'S WHY HE HURRIED BACK TO GAUL PROBABLY HAD BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO 
WELL WHATEVER HIS REASON IT WAS GOOD NEWS FOR US CELTS 
YOU ROMANS STAYED OUT OF BRITAIN LONGER 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY YOU WANTED TO COME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
YOU ALREADY HAD A HUGE EMPIRE WE HAD LOTS OF REASONS 
LIKE WHAT 
LIKE 
I'LL SHOW YOU 
FROM THE EIGHTH CENTURY B. C. 
THE ROMAN EMPIRE BEGAN TO GROW 
BY JULIUS CAESAR HAD GONE AS FAR AS CONQUERING FRANCE 
BUT HE WANTED TO GO FURTHER 
HE BELIEVED BRITAIN HAD LOTS OF MINERALS 
LIKE IRON SILVER AND GOLD 
WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE WEALTH OF THE EMPIRE 
AND ADD TO HIS GLORY BACK IN ROME 
AFTER LANDING IN BRITAIN 
CAESAR SOON FLED WHEN HIS SHIPS GOT DAMAGED IN A STORM 
HE CAME BACK A YEAR LATER IN WITH AN EVEN BIGGER ARMY 
HE FOUGHT THE BRITONS AND MOVED FURTHER INLAND 
THEN DECIDED TO GO BACK TO FRANCE AND NEVER RETURNED 
IN THE ROMANS INVADED BRITAIN AGAIN 
THIS TIME FOLLOWING ORDERS FROM EMPEROR CLAUDIUS 
WE WERE ALWAYS QUICK TO SPOT SOMETHING WORTH HAVING 
LIKE THAT GADGET 
WE'D HAVE INVENTED THIS EVENTUALLY WE WERE QUICK OFF THE MARK 
NOT ABOUT COMING BACK TO BRITAIN THOUGH 
I RECKON YOU WERE MORE SCARED OF US CELTS THAN YOU LET ON HUH 
YOU WERE ALWAYS FIGHTING EACH OTHER 
YOU NEEDED US TO SORT YOU OUT SO WHY DIDN'T YOU COME SOONER 
BIDING OUR TIME 
FANCY TAKING ONE HUNDRED YEARS TO FIND A NEW PARKING SPACE 
YES AND WHAT A GOOD PARKING SPACE IT PROVED TO BE COME ON 
I'LL SHOW YOU 
WHERE DID THE ROMANS LAND IN HOW COME THEY WERE ABLE TO SETTLE THIS TIME 
LOOK ANOTHER ROMAN SITE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
THERE'S NOT MUCH LEFT IT'S ALL FALLING DOWN 
WHAT'S IT SUPPOSED TO BE ANYWAY 
IT'S RICHBOROUGH KNOWN IN ROMAN TIMES AS RUTUPIAE 
IT STARTED OFF AS A FORT AND AN ARMY BASE 
BUT IT SOON GREW TO A SUCCESSFUL TOWN AND PORT 
ONCE WE'D LANDED THERE WAS NO GOING BACK 
MORE'S THE PITY WHAT DID YOU SAY 
I SAID GREAT CITY 
IT IS YEAH THERE ARE ONLY TRACES NOW 
BUT IT HAD A SHELTERED HARBOUR 
AND IT WAS EASY TO SAIL TO FROM FRANCE AND 
WE CAME WE SAW WE CONQUERED 
AND YOU LOT JUST WEREN'T READY FOR US HEY 
WE PUT UP A FIGHT WHEN WE COULD 
AND WE THRASHED YOU EVERY TIME HAH 
BRITAIN WAS OURS FOR THE TAKING 
WHY DIDN'T THE CELTS FIGHT HARDER 
HOW DO WE KNOW ROMANS FOUGHT WELL WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE 
RICHBOROUGH WAS NEXT TO THE SEA IN ROMAN TIMES 
IN 
FORTY THOUSAND OF US CAME HERE 
LANDED RIGHT HERE THEY NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS PARKING 
THEY EVEN BROUGHT WITH THEM ELEPHANTS 
ELEPHANTS YEAH YOU'D NEVER SEEN ELEPHANTS YOU WERE SCARED TO DEATH 
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S IN THE WRITINGS OF DIO CASSIUS DIO WHO 
DIO CASSIUS AND WAS HE ROMAN 
OF COURSE 
WE ROMANS WE HAD LOTS OF WRITERS 
DIO CASSIUS WAS WRITING ABOUT THE INVASION OF BRITAIN 
UNDER EMPEROR CLAUDIUS 
THAT'S HOW TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT OUR ARMY'S TALENTS 
AND YOUR ELEPHANTS YES WELL YOU JUST DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE 
AGAINST OUR MIGHTY LEGIONS 
DIO CASSIUS SAW IT ALL DID HE 
YES NO 
HE WROTE ABOUT IT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS LATER 
AND THOSE STORIES WERE PASSED DOWN THROUGH GENERATIONS 
THEY WERE TOLD FROM A ROMAN POINT OF VIEW 
YOU CELTS COULDN'T RECORD YOUR OWN EVIDENCE YOU COULDN'T WRITE 
NO 
I SUPPOSE NOT BUT WE COULD DEFINITELY FIGHT 
AND I DON'T BELIEVE WE DIDN'T PUT UP A STRUGGLE AGAINST YOU LOT 
ELEPHANTS OR NO ELEPHANTS 
RIGHT I THINK IT'S TIME WE SAW A CELTIC SITE NOW 
IF YOU LIKE 
BUT ER THIS IS WATLING STREET 
WHICH IS ROMAN 
SO IT'LL PROBABLY LEAD SOMEWHERE ROMAN 
I DID TELL YOU 
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SIGNS OF YOU CELTS IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
YEAH AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOU IN FACT I'LL FIND OUT FOR MYSELF 
THIS IS BUTSER ANCIENT FARM 
A THIRTY YEAR OLD PROJECT RESEARCHING THE BRITISH IRON AGE 
THE TIME OF THE CELTS 
HERE PEOPLE LEARN A LOT ABOUT THE CELTS AND THE CELTIC WAY OF LIFE 
BEFORE THE ROMANS CAME 
WE'RE LOOKING AT A VERY DIFFERENT SORT OF COUNTRYSIDE 
COVERED IN SMALL SETTLEMENTS 
IT WAS MADE UP OF FIELDS AND WOODS AND PASTURES 
THINK OF A PATCHWORK OF DIFFERENT SHADES OF GREEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
THE CELTS WERE A WARRIOR BASED SOCIETY 
BUT THEY WERE VERY VERY GOOD FARMERS 
AND THIS LED TO AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TRADE 
LIFE IN A CELTIC VILLAGE REVOLVED AROUND THE PRODUCTION OF FOOD 
IF THEY COULDN'T PRODUCE FOOD THEY STARVED IT'S VERY SEASONAL WORK 
EVEN THE BUILDING AND MAINTENANCE OF HOUSES 
DEPENDED ON THE RIGHT TIME OF YEAR 
DURING THE SUMMER ALL EFFORT WAS SPENT ON LOOKING AFTER THE CROPS 
AUTUMN WAS TIME TO SORT THE ANIMALS OUT AND DECIDE WHICH ONES TO KEEP 
AND THE WINTER WAS THE TIME TO CUT THE WOOD 
THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF CELTIC HOUSES IN MODERN TIMES 
AS THEY WERE BUILT OF WOOD AND STRAW WHICH ROTS AWAY TO NOTHING 
AT BUTSER THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF ACTIVITIES 
WE LEARN ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN LIFE LIVED UNDER AN EMPIRE WHICH IS SIMILAR TO TODAY 
AND LIFE BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF AN EMPIRE 
PEOPLE LIVED A LOT CLOSER TO THE EARTH THEY USED NATURAL MATERIALS 
TO DO ALL THEIR BUILDING AND EVERYTHING WAS BASED ON FARMING 
WHERE HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME NOW THIS DOESN'T LOOK VERY CELTIC 
IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY ROMAN EITHER 
THIS IS MODERN COLCHESTER KNOWN IN ROMAN TIMES AS CAMULODUNUM 
WHEN WE ARRIVED HERE IN WITH EMPEROR CLAUDIUS 
WE'D SUCCEEDED IN CONQUERING BRITAIN 
SHAME YOU DIDN'T STOP HERE OH NO WE HAD TO CAPTURE OF BRITAIN 
FIGHTING YOU LOT AND BUILDING ROMAN SETTLEMENTS ALL OVER 
THE ROMANS ARRIVED AT RICHBOROUGH IN 
THEY FOUGHT THEIR EARLY BATTLES NEAR THE RIVER MEDWAY IN KENT 
AND THEN MARCHED INTO LONDON 
THEN THEY MOVED NORTH OF THE RIVER THAMES 
AND TOOK THEIR TARGET CITY OF COLCHESTER 
THE VICTORIOUS ROMANS CONTINUED TO MOVE ACROSS BRITAIN 
BUILDING MANY TOWNS 
THEY ALSO INTRODUCED TAXES IN THESE PLACES 
AND SENT THE MONEY RAISED TO ROME 
COLCHESTER BECAME BRITANNIA'S CAPITAL CITY 
IF COLCHESTER WAS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU ROMANS 
HOW COME THERE AREN'T MANY SIGNS OF YOU LEFT IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
THERE ARE THEY'RE JUST NOT ALL OBVIOUS 
THE ROADS STILL FOLLOW THE SAME PATTERN THEY DID IN ROMAN TIMES 
SOME OF THE WALLS STILL EXIST 
AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO DIG VERY DEEP TO FIND SIGNS OF US ROMANS 
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT BECAUSE THE PAST IS OFTEN HIDDEN 
BENEATH THE PRESENT 
NO COLCHESTER WAS BUILT IN THE ROMAN STYLE 
ALL THE USUAL FEATURES 
FORUM ROMAN MARKET PLACE 
BASILICA GOVERNMENT BUILDING 
TEMPLE 
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT 
IT WAS EMPEROR CLAUDIUS'S TEMPLE WASN'T IT 
YES THE ONE SPECIALLY BUILT TO CELEBRATE HIS VICTORY 
YE ES AND THE ONE DESTROYED BY THE ICENI TRIBE 
WHO IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY 
WERE CELTS 
YES 
BUT THEY DIDN'T DESTROY IT ALL THOUGH 
DIDN'T THEY NO 
YOU CAN SEE SIGNS OF IT THERE THAT'S NOT A ROMAN BUILDING NO 
BUT THE SIGNS OF US ROMANS CAN BE FOUND 
OH UNDERNEATH 
WHAT HAPPENED TO ROMAN COLCHESTER WHY WAS THE TEMPLE DESTROYED 
THERE YOU ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE TEMPLE 
THOSE ARE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT ROMAN 
SHAME THEY'RE NOT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT HERE 
ROM REMIND ME EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN COLCHESTER 
SURELY WE CELTS DIDN'T GET THE BETTER 
OF YOUR SPLENDID ROMAN ARMY 
CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH 
CAN'T YOU WELL I THINK I MAY BE ABLE TO 
I BELIEVE IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH BOUDICCA 
WHO IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME WELL 
WASN'T ONLY A CELT BUT A WOMAN 
HEY AND A VERY BRAVE ONE TOO 
BOUDICCA 
NEVER HEARD OF HER 
WHO'S SHE WHEN SHE'S AT HOME 
I EXPECT YOUR GADGET WILL BE ABLE TO TELL US 
VERY WELL 
BOUDICCA WAS QUEEN OF ICENI TRIBE 
A GROUP OF CELTS WHO LIVED NORTH OF COLCHESTER 
WHEN THE ROMANS FIRST CONQUERED BRITAIN THEY LEFT THE ICENIS ALONE 
BUT WHEN BOUDICCA'S HUSBAND DIED EVERYTHING CHANGED 
THEY TOOK THE ICENIS' LAND 
WHIPPED BOUDICCA AND ATTACKED HER DAUGHTERS 
FORCING HER TO TAKE REVENGE 
BOUDICCA LED THE ICENIS IN A RAID ON COLCHESTER THEY SET FIRE 
TO THE CITY AND WENT ON TO BURN DOWN LONDON AND SAINT ALBANS 
AT FIRST THEY DIDN'T FACE MUCH OPPOSITION 
BUT THE ROMANS SOON PUT UP AN IMPRESSIVE FIGHT 
AND TOOK CHARGE AGAIN 
BOUDICCA IS SAID TO HAVE KILLED HERSELF RATHER THAN BE SHAMED BY HER ROMAN ENEMIES 
AH BOUDICCA WAS A FINE WOMAN 
BRAVE COURAGEOUS 
NOBLE BEATEN 
YES ALL RIGHT SO YOU BEAT HER IN THE END 
BUT YOU TOOK YOUR TIME THOUGH 
I SUPPOSE YOU'VE BROUGHT US TO YET ANOTHER ROMAN SITE 
WHERE ARE WE NOW SAINT ALBANS 
THE ROMAN CITY OF VERULAMIUM 
THEIR AMPHITHEATRE WELL I HOPE WE HAVEN'T PAID FOR THESE SEATS 
NOT EXACTLY READY FOR AN AUDIENCE 
IT'S NOT BAD CONSIDERING HOW OLD IT IS USE YOUR IMAGINATION 
WE ROMANS CHANGED THE FACE OF BRITAIN 
WITH ALL OUR WONDERFUL BUILDINGS 
WE IMPROVED THINGS NO END 
NO YOU DIDN'T WE DIDN'T NEED IMPROVING 
WE WERE HAPPY WITH THINGS THE WAY THEY WERE YOU WOULD SAY THAT 
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PEOPLE KNOW WHAT GREAT THINGS WE BROUGHT TO BRITAIN 
YES AND I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THEM 
THANK YOU WE HAVEN'T FINISHED YET 
YES WELL I HAVE AND I'M GOING BACK TO MY OWN TIME 
NOW WHERE'S THAT TIME TRAVEL EXPRESS 
I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'S DISAPPEARED BACK TO GAUL LIKE JULIUS CAESAR 
IT'LL BE HERE DON'T WORRY 
IT'S PROBABLY JUST LOOKING FOR A PARKING SPACE
