NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII HHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOO 
YOU TWO SOUND LIKE SOCKS AND COOKIE 
THINGS GET EVEN WEIRDER LOTS MORE TO COME 
ANDY YOU'VE BEEN BUSY LEARNING HOW TO SUMO AND YOU'RE IN THE GEAR 
THIS IS THE MAWASHI LEONI WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE MAWASHI WELL 
IT'S TO EITHER LIFT OR THROW YOUR OPPONENT 
IT IS TRADITIONAL AND SUMO HAS LOTS OF TRADITIONS CHECK THIS OUT 
SUMO MIGHT MAKE YOU THINK OF BIG MEN IN NAPPIES 
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE TO THIS ANCIENT SPORT 
SUMO IS THE TRADITIONAL SPORT OF JAPAN 
AND IT'S OVER ONE THOUSAND YEARS OLD 
SUMO WAS ORIGINALLY PERFORMED TO ENTERTAIN GODS DURING FESTIVALS 
TODAY EACH WRESTLER STILL ASKS THE HELP OF THE GODS TO WIN THE FIGHT 
BEFORE EACH MATCH THERE IS A CEREMONY 
THE WRESTLERS RAISE THEIR ARMS TO SHOW THEY'RE NOT ARMED 
THEY SCARE AWAY DEMONS BY STAMPING AND THROW SALT INTO THE RING 
THAT'S BEFORE THE MATCH EVEN STARTS 
FIGHTING CAN LAST A FEW SECONDS OR UP TO THREE MINUTES 
YOU CAN PUSH SLAP TRIP AND THROW PULLING HAIR AND PUNCHING ARE OUT 
BETTER BEHAVE ANDY 
LET'S GET BACK TO IT ALEX WHAT IS THE NEXT MOVE THE TSURI 
SHOW US GRAB THE BELT KEEP YOUR BACK STRAIGHT HEAD UP AND LIFT 
CAN YOU TRY THAT ANDY O. K. LEONI YOU STAND THERE ARE YOU READY

PUT YOUR FOOT THERE USE YOUR HIP AND THROW O. K. 
O. K. THE NAGE IS A THROW LET ME SEE IT 
GO LEONI 
NICE WILL YOU BE ABLE TO DO THAT ONE 
LOOKS MORE COMPLICATED STAND THERE 
SO I GRAB YOUR ARM AND BELT YEAH I PUT MY FOOT FORWARD LIKE THIS 
AND THEN CHUCK YOU OVER 
IT'S QUITE SIMILAR TO A JUDO MOVE THAT WOW IT IS 
ANDY YOU'RE DOING REALLY WELL I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU TO IT 
IN THE MEANTIME 
YOU MAY NOT THINK THAT PIGEONS ARE PHYSICALLY WEIRD ANIMALS 
BUT HEY THIS MIGHT CHANGE YOUR MIND 
NEXT UP IN OUR A Z. OF WEIRD ANIMALS IS THE LETTER V. 
FOR VICTORIA CROWNED PIGEON 
THIS AWFULLY POSH PIGEON 
IS FROM THE TROPICAL RAINFORESTS OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA 
PIGEONS NOT THE MOST REMARKABLE OF BIRDS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT 
THEY'RE GREY CHUBBY EAT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT 
PLUS THEY POO ON EVERYTHING 
AND THEN I HEARD THERE WAS A PIGEON THAT WAS BRIGHT BLUE 
AND THE SIZE OF A TURKEY 
YEAH WHATEVER YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS 
OR CAN YOU 
WHAT 
THAT'S NOT A PIGEON 
IT IS A PIGEON IN FACT IT'S THE LARGEST PIGEON IN THE WORLD 
THE VICTORIA CROWNED PIGEON 
HOW MANY SPECIES OF PIGEON ARE THERE 
I KNOW THE ONES I SEE IN LONDON 
YEAH THEY'RE YOUR COMMON FERAL PIGEON 
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF SPECIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 
RANGING FROM THE VICTORIA CROWNED PIGEON THE BIGGEST 
TO REALLY SMALL ONES LIKE THE ZEBRA DOVE RELATED TO THE DODO 
THEY MAKE A VERY UNUSUAL CONTACT SOUND IN THE FOREST 
THEY LIVE IN LOOSE GROUPS OF UP TO TWENTY AND THEY NEED TO KEEP IN CONTACT 
THEY MAKE A DEEP BOOMING SOUND 
THE CALL IS TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ONE ANOTHER 
AND IT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE BLOWING OVER A MILK BOTTLE REALLY 
I'VE GOT A MILK BOTTLE IF YOU WANT TO TRY IT REALLY HAVE A GO 
COME ON LITTLE PIGEON WHERE ARE YOU COME ON 
COME ON PIGEON COME ON 
COME ON PIGEON WHAT 
OH DEAR DIDN'T SEEM TO LIKE ME MUCH 
SO WHERE SHOULD WE PUT THE VICTORIA CROWNED PIGEON ON OUR WALL OF WEIRD 
SHOULD IT BE ON THE URGHH WEIRD SIDE OR THE AHH WEIRD SIDE 
WELL I SORT OF LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S VERY REGAL 
WITH THAT BIG FUNKY HAIRCUT THAT LOOKS LIKE A CROWN 
SO I'M GOING TO PUT IT ON THE AHH WEIRD SIDE OF THE WALL 
THERE WE GO 
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT ANY ANIMALS IN OUR A Z. 
YOU SHOULD GO TO OUR WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN PRINT OFF AND KEEP 
ONE OF THESE FACT SHEETS ABOUT EVERY SINGLE ANIMAL 
YOU SHOULD BE SUMO I JUST WANTED TO TELL EVERYONE 
IT'S THE SECOND PART OF OUR CHINA ADVENTURES WHERE WE GO TO MEET 
A BEIJING OPERA STAR WHO PUTS US THROUGH OUR PACES 
LAAAAA 
OUR MASTER CLASS TOOK US TO THE HOME OF THE BEIJING OPERA 
MR. WEN RUHUA THE MOST FAMOUS BEIJING OPERA STAR IN CHINA 
WOW NI HAO PLEASURE TO MEET YOU 
WHAT A FANTASTIC OUTFIT 
HE WANTS TO PERFORM FOR YOU GREAT 
GIVE YOU SOME IDEAS OF WHAT BEIJING OPERA IS ABOUT 
O. K. O. K. 
OPERA ISN'T JUST ABOUT SINGING HOW YOU MOVE IS VERY IMPORTANT 
THE IMPORTANT THING IS FOR THE TWO FEET TO ALWAYS BE ON THE SAME LINE 
YOUR BACK UPPER BODY DOESN'T MOVE 
YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR LEGS REALLY CLOSE TOGETHER DON'T YOU 
SHALL WE DO IT PROPERLY O. K. HERE WE GO 
READY 
HE SAYS YOU DID IT VERY VERY WELL 
WELL DONE 
AND HE SAYS YOUR LEGS ARE TOO STIFF 
LIKE TWO STICKS ACTUALLY 
HEY IT DID LOOK A BIT RIDICULOUS 
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I LOOKED PERFECTLY NORMAL 
HOW D'YOU MAKE THAT LOOK NORMAL THAT'S WICKED 
THE SWORDS PRESENTED A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE 
THAT LOOKS STUNNING 
IT LOOKS VERY COMPLICATED BUT ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE EASY 
THAT STILL LOOKS COMPLICATED TO ME NO NO NO LOOK LIKE THIS 
TRY IT TRY IT O. K. I'LL GIVE IT A GO 
I SMACKED THE SWORD 
YES YES 
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A HELICOPTER 
BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO ROTATE BOTH HANDS AT THE SAME TIME 
I KEEP HITTING MYSELF WITH THE SWORD 
THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO GO IN A CIRCLE 
SO COMPARED TO YOU BOTH HANDS ARE DOING THINGS 
YEAH I WOULDN'T MESS WITH HIM WITH SWORDS WITH ANY OBJECT 
SO WHO'S GOT THE MOST POTENTIAL TO BE IN THE BEIJING OPERA 
THE BEST WAY TO JUDGE IS THE VOICE 
AS SOON AS HE HEARS THE VOICE 
HE MIGHT HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHO HAS THE POTENTIAL AND ABILITY 
O. K. THIS'LL BE INTERESTING 
THE THING ABOUT THE VOICE 
IT'S SO DIFFERENT AND PROBABLY VERY DIFFICULT TO DO 
LET'S HAVE A GO O. K. 
NIIIIIII HHHHAAAAAAAOOOOOOO 
THAT'S HELLO BY THE WAY 
NIII HAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
NIIIIIII HHHHAAAAAAOOOOOOOOO 
NIII HAAAAAAOOOOOOO 
COME BACK TO YOU O. K. YOU CAN GO I CAN'T PULL MYSELF TOGETHER 
ANDY'S GOT THE GIGGLES CAN'T BLAME HIM 
NIIIIII HHHHHAAAAAAOOOOOOO

VERY GOOD 
ACTUALLY HE SAID YOU BOTH HAVE GOOD VOICES 
THROUGH THAT

BETTER THAN YOURS YES NOT BETTER THAN HIS
