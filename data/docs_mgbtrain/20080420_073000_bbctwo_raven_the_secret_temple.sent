SO I HAVE SUMMONED SIXTEEN OF MY FINEST WARRIORS TO A LAND FAR TO THE EAST 
WHERE THEY MUST UNDERGO MANY TRIALS 
TO FIND THE MAGICAL WATERS TO BREAK THIS SPELL 
BUT MY ENEMY HAS FOLLOWED ME HERE 
AND HE MEANS TO STOP THIS QUEST AT ANY COST 
THE QUEST TO DISCOVER THE SECRET TEMPLE 
THE EAGLES PANTHERS AND WOLVES ALL HAVE THIRTEEN GEMS APIECE 
BUT THE WOLVES HAVE LOST THEIR COMRADE TIBOR 
THOUGH THE TIGERS GAINED THREE GEMS AT THE TEMPLE PILLARS MAKING THIRTEEN 
HADAV FAILED TO COMPLETE THE CHALLENGE 
REUNITING HIM WITH HIS TEAM MATES COST THEM EIGHT JEWELS 
NOW THEY TRAIL BEHIND THE OTHERS WITH FIVE 
DESOT AFTER THE TEMPLE SPIRIT RUN 
YOU ARE LEFT WITH ONLY THREE WARRIORS 
WAS IT THE RIGHT DECISION NOT TO BRING TIBOR BACK 
WE DECIDED THAT HE NEEDED TOO MUCH ENCOURAGEMENT 
WHEN IT WASN'T THERE THEN HE WOULD FAIL CHALLENGES 
LYMEL AND NEBRA DID YOU AGREE 
I DISAGREED AND SAID HE HAS TO BE BACK 
BECAUSE IT'S BETTER TO PLAY WITH ALL FOUR MEMBERS 
BUT IT WAS TWO AGAINST ONE 
I FELT THAT TIBOR WHEN WE WEREN'T THERE TO ENCOURAGE HIM 
HE'D START TO PANIC AGAIN AND FAIL CHALLENGES 
SO I THOUGHT HE HAD TO BE LOST 
THE WARRIORS WILL BE TESTED 
ON THEIR SPEED STRENGTH WISDOM AND LEADERSHIP 
AS THEY FACE THE THIRD OF FOURTEEN TASKS 
UNDER THE BURNING SUN OF THIS MYSTERIOUS LAND 
SO LET THE DAY'S CHALLENGES BEGIN 
WARRIORS THESE STONES WERE FORMED FROM THE MOUTHS OF MIGHTY VOLCANOES 
CENTURIES AGO 
BUT NOW THEY FORM THE PLATFORM FOR THIS THE THIRD OF YOUR FOURTEEN TASKS 
YOUR STRENGTH IS BEING TESTED TODAY 
FOR EACH OF YOU MUST ASSEMBLE AN OBELISK AT THE TOP OF THIS MOUND 
THE STONES YOU NEED ARE HERE AT YOUR FEET 
FITTED CORRECTLY THE RAYS OF THE SUN 
WILL STRIKE THE PILLARS YOU HAVE MADE 
AND JEWELS WILL BE FORGED FROM THE ROCKS BELOW BUT BE QUICK 
FOR IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLETE THIS CHALLENGE BEFORE THE SECOND DRUM 
THE SPIRIT GUARD WILL REMOVE YOU FROM THIS Q. U. E. S. T. 
SO WORK HARD NOW TO HAUL THESE PIECES INTO PLACE 
AND REMEMBER THE STRENGTH OF A WARRIORS ARM IS DOUBLED 
BY HIS DETERMINATION TO SUCCEED 
TO CARRY THESE HEAVY BLOCKS UP A DIFFICULT SLOPE IN SEARING HEAT 
IS A TEST INDEED FOR SAMRA KARJA TAYLAN AND LEADER YEADA 
TIGERS YONDER LIES THE SCENE OF A BATTLE FOUGHT MANY YEARS AGO 
THE JEWELS YOU SEEK ARE HIDDEN IN THIS HAUNTED PLACE 
THE DEFEATED WARRIORS LIE UNEASILY HERE AND WILL RISE AGAINST ANY 
WHO WANDERS UNPREPARED ONTO THEIR HALLOWED GROUND 
BUT THE SPIRITS OF THESE VANQUISHED SOLDIERS WILL NOT STIR 
UNLESS LOOKED UPON DIRECTLY 
ONE WHO IS BLINDFOLDED MAY WALK UNDISTURBED AMONGST THEM 
PROVIDED THE REMAINS OF THE DEPARTED ARE NOT TOUCHED 
MARCA CHOOSE WHO WILL WALK 
THEN GUIDE THAT WARRIOR TOWARDS THE JEWELS AND AWAY FROM THE DEPARTED 
REMEMBER THIS IS A TEST OF YOUR LEADERSHIP 
WHEN THE SECOND DRUM SOUNDS YOU MUST ENSURE THEIR SAFE RETURN 
BEFORE THE DRUM BEATS FOR A THIRD AND FINAL TIME 
WHO AM I GOING TO GUIDE THROUGH 
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT 
I'M NOT KEEN EITHER I'LL DO IT ARE YOU SURE YEAH I'M FINE 
YOU CAN DO IT JENRO BEST OF LUCK 
IF I CAN JUST GET BEHIND YOU 
JENRO OF THE TIGERS SHOWS GREAT BRAVERY 
TO TACKLE THE FIELD OF THE DEAD KNOWING HE CANNOT BE BROUGHT BACK 
IS COURAGEOUS INDEED 
JUST KEEP WALKING 
O. K. WALK FORWARD JUST KEEP ON WALKING 
DON'T WORRY GO ON JENRO 
JUST KEEP ON GOING 
KEEP ON GOING 
YOU'RE DOING REALLY WELL JENRO TURN TO YOUR RIGHT 
NOW WALK FORWARD

THAT'S IT KEEP WALKING YOU'RE FINE JENRO JUST WALK 
THAT'S REALLY GOOD JENRO 
STOP YOU'RE DOING WELL 
O. K. I THINK WARRIORS EACH OF THESE STRANGE VESSELS 
CONTAINS A JEWEL FLOATING IN ITS DEPTHS 
BUT AS YET THESE GEMS ARE OUT OF REACH 
YOU MUST USE ANYTHING YOU CAN FIND TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF THE WATER 
AND RECOVER THESE PRECIOUS STONES 
BUT THIS IS A TEST OF SPEED 
IF ANY OF YOU PROVE TOO TARDY 
YOU'LL BE TRAPPED IN THE GLARE OF THE SERPENT THAT GUARDS THIS TASK 
WHEN THE DRUM SOUNDS THIS CHALLENGE MUST BE COMPLETED 
BEFORE IT STRIKES AGAIN 
WITH TIBOR LOST TO THE WOLVES 
DESOT NEBRA AND LYMEL MUST WORK TOGETHER 
TO GAIN THE FIRST JEWEL THEN EACH MUST STRIVE TO GAIN THEIR OWN 
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING THIS TASK APPEARS TOO EASY 
THE GEMS ARE THERE BEFORE YOU WHAT PREVENTS THEIR RECOVERY 
BUT BE WARY WARRIORS 
FOR IF YOU WERE TO APPROACH THESE JEWELS 
DO NOT WORRY THERE IS A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM 
YOU MUST USE YOUR MINDS NOW TO FIND IT 
LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE SYMBOLS WRITTEN ON THE EARTH 
THEY SHOULD FORM A CIRCLE BUT THREE ARE MISSING 
DRAW THEM CORRECTLY AND COMPLETE THE PATTERN TO RECOVER THE JEWELS 
THE ROCKS AROUND YOU WILL HELP YOU IN THIS TASK 
GO ON BEGIN YOUR SEARCH FIND THE SOLUTION 
FOR IF YOU DO NOT THE FIRE WILL RISE EVERY TIME YOU APPROACH 
AND YOUR SEARCH WILL COME TO NOTHING 
I'LL LOOK AT THE SYMBOLS ON THE ROCKS O. K. WE'LL PAINT 
AND I'LL GO AND CHECK OUT THE DESIGNS O. K.

WHICH I WAS NOT GOING TO DO 
I'M TRYING TO GET HIM OUT OF THERE HADAV 
I TRIED TO HELP 
BUT I REALISED I WAS MAKING A MISTAKE AND THAT SHE WAS RIGHT 
IT WAS REALLY SCARY I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING 
WE HADN'T THE JEWELS TO BUY ME BACK AS WE'D ALREADY BOUGHT HADAV BACK

WE DIDN'T HAVE OUR LAST MEMBER TIBOR 
SO WE HAD TO FILL HIS CONTAINER ALSO 
WE HAD TO WORK REALLY HARD BUT WE STILL GOT ALL OUR FOUR JEWELS 
RIGHT THEN WE'RE ONTO IT CURVES THAT WAY I THINK 
NO IT ISN'T IT'S STRAIGHT LINES 
ARTON HAS TAKEN THE MANTLE OF LEADER IN THIS TASK

BUT THEY REALISE THEY HAVE GIVEN THE SUN A RAY TOO MANY 
RIGHT TRY AGAIN 
READY 
THIS TIME THE PANTHERS REACH THEIR GOAL 
WHOO YEAH WELL DONE 
WELL DONE TAKE IT QUICK 
AT RANGOLI RING 
I TOOK MORE CONTROL THAN THE LEADER SONRO 
HE WAS THE ONE WHO MADE THE MISTAKE WHEN THE FLAMES CAME UP 
WE WERE ALL SURPRISED THEN WE FIXED IT AND GOT THE JEWELS 
EACH TEAM HAS NOW COMPLETED THREE OF THE FOURTEEN TESTS 
TODAY THE EAGLES WOLVES AND PANTHERS GAINED FOUR GEMS 
EACH NOW HAS A TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN 
THE TIGERS ANXIOUS NOT TO LOSE THEIR COMRADE JENRO 
GAINED BUT ONE JEWEL AT THE FIELD OF THE DEAD 
THEY TRAIL THE OTHERS WITH A MERE SIX 
MARCA JENRO VOLUNTEERED TO GO INTO THE FIELD OF THE DEAD 
KNOWING THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH JEWELS TO BRING HIM BACK IF HE WAS LOST 
I THINK HE SHOWED HE'S BRAVE AND THAT HE TRUSTS ME LOADS 
WE DID WELL IT WAS REALLY GOOD 
JENRO WHAT GAVE YOU THE COURAGE THE BRAVERY TO DO THIS 
I THINK IT WAS THE FACT THAT THE TEAM NEEDED SOMEONE TO DO IT 
SO I DECIDED TO DO IT 
SO THE OTHERS WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH BEING BLINDFOLDED 
AND BECAUSE I TRUST MARCA 
NEVAR STALKS THIS MISSION LIKE A SHADOW 
AS I CONTINUE TO GUARD THE WARRIORS HE CONTINUES TO WATCH MY EVERY MOVE 
BUT IN THE END HE MUST DESTROY ME OR BE DESTROYED 
BUT I WILL BIDE MY TIME NEVAR WILL GROW IMPATIENT 
AND AN IMPATIENT ENEMY MAKES MISTAKES 
MEANWHILE THE QUEST MUST CONTINUE 
THE SECRET TEMPLE MUST BE FOUND 
MY HOMELAND MUST BE SAVED 
NEXT TIME ON RAVEN THE SECRET TEMPLE 
THE TIGERS FACE THE TERROR OF GIANT CATAPULT 
THRALL THREADS IS WAITING FOR THE WOLVES 
ARE THE EAGLES FAST ENOUGH FOR TEMPLE SPIRIT RUN 
AND WILL COURAGE FAIL THE PANTHERS ON THE LEDGE 
I KNOW WHERE NEVAR IS ENCAMPED 
HIS PLAN IS NOTHING SHORT OF THE WARRIORS' DEMISE 
I MUST THWART HIM AT ALL COSTS
