HELLO I'M JEREMY VINE AND THIS IS PANORAMA PILOTS OVERCOME BY FUMES 
AT TWENTY THOUSAND FEET 
I WAS PARALYSED 
YOU CAN IMAGINE AN AIRCRAFT WITH NO 
PILOTS GOING FULL SPEED IN A 
DESCENT TOWARDS AN AIRPORT 
HOLIDAY MAKERS PREPARING TO SUE 
OVER CLAIMS THEIR HEALTH HAS BEEN 
DAMAGED 
WE GOT ON THAT PLANE VERY DAMAGED HEALTHY AND WE GOT OFF THE PLANE 
VERY SICK L. WANT TO KNOW WHY WE 
ARE STILL SUFFERING SYMPTOMS COULD COULD THE AIR THEY BREATHE BE AFFECTING 
PILOTS' JUDGMENT 
WE HAVE GOT 
PILOTS CONFUSING INFORMATION FROM 
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL PASSENGERS 
SHOULD BE CONCERNED THIS IS A 
POTENTIAL FLIGHT SAFETY ISSUE 
ARE YOU ALREADY PLANNING WHERE YOU 
WILL BE JETTING OFF TO THIS SUMMER 
CHECKING OUT THE BROCHURES AND 
TRACKING DOWN THOSE BARGAIN 
FLIGHTS IF SO YOU WILL BE HOPING 
TO COME BACKRESTED AND RELAXED IT 
DOESN'T ALWAYS TURN OUT LIKE THAT 
TONIGHT PANORAMA MEET IT IS PILOTS 
AND HOLIDAY MAKERS WHO BELIEVE 
FLYING HAS MADE THEM ILL AND THEY 
ARE CONVINCED IT IS THE AIR ON 
BOARD PLANES THAT IS TO BLAME 
WE ARE A NATION THAT IS BECOMING 
HOOKED ON AIR TRAVEL WE TAKE MORE 
THAN FIFTY SIX MILLION FLIGHT AS YEAR AND 
SPEND MORE TIME IN THE AIR THAN 
EVER BEFORE SAMANTHA SABATINO AND 
HER FAMILY USED TO LOVE THEIR 
EXOTIC HOLIDAYS BUT THAT ALL 
CHANGED EARLY LAST YEAR ON CHARTER 
FLIGHT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FROM GATWICK TO FLORIDA 
WE WAS ALL REALLY EXCITED AND WE 
FELT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT FIT AND HEALTHY AND 
LOOKING FORWARD TO A GREAT HOLIDAY 
ABOUT SEVEN TO EIGHT HOURS INTO THE 
FLIGHT EMILY SAID MUMMY THERE IS 
A FUNNY SMELL IN THE CABIN WITHIN 
SECONDS SHE WENT PURE WHITE AND SHE 
VOMITED EVERY WHERE 
SHE SUSPECTS 
THE FUNNY SMELL WAS TOXIC FUMES 
AND SHE SAID SHE SUFFERED SEVERE 
FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS 
I FELT PARALYSED 
AND HAD WHEEZING AND LOTS OF 
CRACKLING IN THE CHEST MAKING A 
NOISE LIKE THIS CRRSH L. THOUGHT 
SOMETHING SERIOUS WAS WRONG YOU YOU HAVE COLLECTED QUITE A NUMBER OF 
DOCUMENTS WHAT 
IS THIS ONE THIS THIS IS THE SICK PASSENGER LIST THAT I 
TOOK AT THE AIRPORT 
AS THEY WAITED 
TO FLY HOME SAMANTHA SAID SHE MADE 
A LIST OF THIRTY ONE PASSENGERS WHO 
COMPLAINED THEY TOO HAD BEEN UNWELL 
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT L. WAS 
ASTONISHED THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAD 
GOTTEN SICK AND THEY ALL SAID THEIR 
SYMPTOMS HAD STARTED ON THE PLANE 
JOURNEY OUT 
WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED 
THE PASSENGERS' ILLNESS DOCTORS 
SAY SAMANTHA DIDN'T HAVE AN 
INFECTION AND MOST PUZZLING OF ALL 
IS THAT HER FAMILY ARE STILL 
SUFFERING 
THERE'S NOT BEEN ONE SUFFERING WEEK WHERE ALL THE CHILDREN HAVE 
BEEN AT SCHOOL FOR A FULL WEEK 
ONE'S FAINTED AT SCHOOL ONE'S BEEN 
SENT HOME THE LIST IS ENDLESS THE THE CHILDRENS' SCHOOL REPORTS SHOW 
THEIR ATTENDANCE HAS DROPPED FROM 
EXCELLENT TO POOR 
YOU HAVE TO ASK 
YOURSELF WHY DO ALL THESE THINGS 
KEEP HAPPENING IT STARTED FROM 
THAT FLIGHT 
HOW COULD HARMFUL FUMES GET INTO 
ANY WELL BUILT PLANE AND AFFECT 
PASSENGERS LOOK AT THE DESIGN 
EXTRAORDINARY AS IT MAY SEEM MOST 
MODERN AEROPLANES ARE BUILT SO THAT 
THE AIR SUPPLY FOR PASSENGERS AND 
CREW COMES FROM THE ENGINES 
BECAUSE THEY ARE OPERATING AT HIGH 
TEMPERATURES ANY LEAK OF ENGINE OIL 
CAN QUICKLY TURN INTO A MIST OF 
CHEMICALS THEY CAN BE BREATHED IN 
BY THE PEOPLE ON BOARD JET ENGINE 
OIL DOES WHAT IT SAYS ON THE TIN 
THERE HAVE BEEN WARNINGS ABOUT 
HARMFUL CHEMICALS THAT CAN CAUSE 
PARALYSIS OR AFFECT THE NERVOUS 
SYSTEM PROFESSOR CHRIS VAN NETTEN 
A TOXICOLOGIST HAS CARRIED OUT 
STUDIES INTO THE HAZARDS FROM THESE 
OILS FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS 
FIRST A GAS IS BEING MADE AND ONE 
OF THE MAJOR GASES I MEASURED IS 
CARBON MONOXIDE AND THIS IS A VERY 
TOXIC POISON YOU GET A WHOLE HOST 
OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT ARE IN 
THE OIL INCLUDING T. C. P. OR 
TRICRESYLPHOSPHATES TRICRESYLPHOSPHATES TRICRESYLPHOSPHATES IS WELL 
ESTABLISHED IT'S A NEUROTOXIN 
WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE SUFFERED 
SYMPTOMS NAUSEA HEADACHES 
RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS AFTER 
BREATHING FUMES ON AN AEROPLANE IS 
IT CREDIBLE THAT THE FUMES COULD 
HAVE CAUSED THIS SYMPTOMS 
THEY MAY 
BE RIGHT THE FACT THEY ARE 
COMPLAINING ABOUT CENTRAL NERVOUS 
SYSTEM AND NERVOUS SYSTEM PROBLEMS 
WOULD FIT IN WITH AN EXPOSURE TO 
TRICRESYLPHOSPHATES OR T. C. P. WHAT WE 
DON'T KNOW YET IS WHAT THE EXPOSURE 
LEVEL THAT MIGHT RESULT IN THE 
SYMPTOMS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE 
COMPLAINING ABOUT 
WE WANTED TO 
TEST WHETHER TOXIC CHEMICALS FROM 
ENGINE OIL CAN GET INTO THE AIR 
PASSENGERS AND CREW BREATHE ON A 
NORMAL FLIGHT SO WITHOUT ASKING 
PERMISSION WE TOOK SOME SAMPLES 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF CONTAMINATED 
AIR IS THAT YOU MAY NOT ALWAYS BE 
ABLE TO DETECT IT BECAUSE IT CAN BE 
INVISIBLE AND ODOURLESS SO WE ARE 
TAKING FLIGHTS ON A NUMBER OF 
PLANES TO MAKE SOME TESTS OF OUR 
OWN ON TWO DOMESTIC FLIGHTS WE 
USED AIR SAMPLERS APPROVED BY THE 
U. S. GOVERNMENT AND TOOK SWABS FROM 
SURFACES ON THREE PLANES WE WILL 
LEARN LATER IF THERE WERE ANY 
POISONS IN THE AIR THE INDUSTRY 
CALLS CASES OF AIR POLLUTION FROM 
ANY SOURCE FUME EVENTS NO ONE IS 
SURE HOW OFTEN THEY HAPPEN OVER A 
FIVE YEAR PERIOD BRITAIN'S CIVIL 
AVIATION AUTHORITY RECORDED TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO OF 
THEM THE MAIN PILOTS' UNION 
DATABASE SHOWS SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THE GOVERNMENT 
ESTIMATE PUTS IT MUCH HIGHER AT ONE 
IN EVERY TWO THOUSAND FLIGHTS WITH TWELVE 
MILLION FLIGHTS A YEAR BY U. K. 
OPERATORS THAT WOULD MEAN THREE THOUSAND 
FUME EVENTS IN FIVE YEARS IT IS 
NOT ONLY PASSENGERS WHO COULD BE AT 
RISK PILOTS ALSO BREATHE AIR FROM 
THE ENGINES IF THEY WERE TO BECOME 
BADLY AFFECTED BY FUMES THAT COULD 
PUT THE WHOLE FLIGHT IN DANGER 
I HAVE BEEN ON FULL EMERGENCY 
OXYGEN YET THE PASSENGERS HAVE 
BEEN LEFT WITH PAPER UP THEIR NOSES 
BECAUSE THE FUMES HAVE BEEN SO 
STRONG 
TRISTAN LORAINE CAMPAIGNS STRONG FOR BETTER EQUALITY 
TODAY THEY MAY 
BE SUFFERING THE EFFECTS AND DON'T 
KNOW WHY 
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME 
FRIGHTENING INCIDENTS ONE HAPPENED 
LAST SUMMER ON BOARD THIS BRITISH 
AEROSPACE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX AS IT FLEW BETWEEN 
BIRMINGHAM AND BELFAST WITH NINETY 
PASSENGERS ON BOARD TWO MEMBERS OF 
THE CABIN CREW WERE OVERCOME ONE ONE MEMBER OF THE CREW BECAME VIOLENTLY 
SICK 
ANOTHER ONE TURNED BLUE AROUND THE 
MOUTH SHE ALSO COLLAPSED BOTH OF 
THEM HAD TO BE PUT ON OXYGEN ALL ALL THE CREW BUT NONE OF THE PASSENGERS 
WERE TAKEN TO NEARBY HOSPITALS FOR 
CHECK UPS AND BLOOD TESTS 
PASSENGERS WERE NOT ADVISED OF THIS 
INCIDENT EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE 
BREATHING THE SAME AIR AS THE CABIN 
CREW THERE IS A FEAR FACTOR AMONG 
CABIN CREW OF THIS AIRCRAFT THE 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX 
AN INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX OIL SEALS HAD FAILED ON TWO OF THE 
ENGINES THE AIRLINE CONCERNED SAYS 
IT IS JUST ONE BRITISH AEROSPACE 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX LEFT IN ITS FLEET AND THAT WILL 
BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE BY THE 
SUMMER PANORAMA HAS SPOKEN TO 
SEVERAL SERVING PILOT WHO IS HAVE 
DESCRIBED THE POTENTIALLY SERIOUS 
EFFECTS OF FUMES THEY WON'T GO ON 
THE RECORD FOR FEAR OF LOSING THEIR 
JOBS NOW RETIRED THIS MAN WILL 
NINE YEARS AGO HE AND HIS CO PILOT 
WERE BOTH OVERCOME BY FUMES AS THEY 
STARTED THEIR DESCENT INTO MALMO 
AIRPORT IN SWEDEN THERE WERE 
NEARLY SEVENTY PASSENGERS ON BOARD THE 
BRITISH AEROSPACE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX PLANE 
MY FIRST OFFICER SAID I'M GOING 
TO PUKE I GRABBED MY OXYGEN MASK 
PUT IT ON LIKE SO 
HOW SERIOUSLY 
WERE YOU IMPAIRED 
TOTALLY L. WAS 
PROBABLY FIVE SECONDS FROM PASSING 
OUT L. WAS LIKE PARALYSED L. WAS 
LIKE OVERCOOKED SPAGHETTI I 
COULDN'T LIFT MY HAND YOU CAN 
IMAGINE AN AIRCRAFT WITH NO PILOTS 
GOING FULL SPEED INTO A DESCENT 
TOWARDS AN AIRPORT 
WITH HIS MASK 
ON NEILS ECOPILOT LANDED THE PLANE 
SUFFICIENTLY ON HIS OWN NEILS' 
CO PILOT LANDED THE PLANE 
SUFFICIENTLY ON HIS OWN THE THE 
PILOTS WERE TEMPORARILY AFFECTED BY 
PROBABLY POLLUTED CABIN AIR 
I SAW 
THE ENGINE MYSELF AFTER LANDING 
ONE OF THE ENGINEERS SHOWED ME 
WHERE THE ENGINE IS SUPPOSED TO BE 
TOTALLY CLEAN OF OIL WHERE THE 
BLADE AREA IS TAKEN IT WAS JUST 
DRIPPING WITH OIL 
TOXIC GASES FROM 
HOT ENGINE OIL ARE THE MOST 
PROBABLE CAUSE OF PILOTS BEING 
AFFECTED LIKE THIS ACCORDING TO 
PROFESSOR CHRIS VAN NETTEN 
PILOTS BECOME INCAPACITATED DUE TO 
EXPOSURE OF THE CARBON MONOXIDE 
THE COMBINATION MIGHT BE A VERY 
POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE FOR THEM TO BE 
IN 
HOW OFTEN ARE FLIGHT CREWS IN IN THE U. K. AFFECTED CAMPAIGNERS SAY 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FUME EVENTS LIFT BRITISH 
PILOTS IMPAIRED OVER SIX YEARS THE 
CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY RECORDED 
THIRTEEN FUME EVENTS WHERE PILOTS IN U. K. 
AIRSPACE WERE INCAPACITATED THIS 
IS THE OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION 
REPORT INTO JUST ONE OF THE 
INCIDENTS AND IT MAKES ALARMING 
READING THE CREW NOTICED AN OILY 
PETROL LIKE SMELL THE FIRST 
OFFICER SAID HE FELT DREADFUL HE 
TURNED WHITE AND HAD HIGHLY DILATED 
PUPILS MEANTIME THE COMMANDER 
FELT LIGHT HEADED SUFFERED FROM 
DOUBLE VISION AND AS HE WAS COMING 
INTO LAND EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY 
JUDGING HEIGHT IT SOUNDS LIKE A 
NIGHTMARE 
FUMES IN COCKPIT NIGHTMARE REQUEST IMMEDIATE LANDING OFFICIAL OFFICIAL REPORTS ON INCAPACITATION INCIDENTS 
INVOLVING OTHER PLANES ARE EQUALLY 
WORRYING BOTH THE PILOT AND CO 
PILOT BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS 
OF TUNNEL VISION LOSS OF BALANCE 
AND LOSS OF FEELING IN HANDS AND 
LOWER ARMS AN EMERGENCY WAS 
DECLARED 
CONFIRM CLEAR TO LAND DECLARED THE CREW MISSED NUMEROUS AIR 
TRAFFIC CONTROL CALLS THE 
COMMANDER DID NOT REDUCE SPEED FOR 
LANDING UNTIL REMINDED TO DO SO BY 
THE CONTROLLER 
THERE IS A RISK THAT PILOTS WILL 
BECOME INCAPACITATED AND WE ARE 
WORKING TOWARDS A PERFECT WORLD 
WHERE THAT RISK DOESN'T EXIST WE 
HAVE TO MITIGATE IT IF YOU WERE TO 
DO A GROSS ERROR CHECK THERE ARE 
NO AIRCRAFT CRASHES AS A RESULT OF 
CABIN AIR QUALITY EVENTS SO IT'S 
NOT YET A DISASTER IT IS SOMETHING 
WE NEED TO LOOK INTO 
WHILE IN THEORY PASSENGERS AND CREW 
COULD SUFFER FROM CONTAMINATED AIR 
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE DESIGN 
IN PRACTICE SOME TYPES OF AIRCRAFT 
MIGHT APPEAR TO BE MORE PRONE TO 
THE PROBLEM THAN OTHERS ACCORDING 
TO THE DATABASE AT THE PILOTS' 
UNION BALPA TWO PLANES THE BRITISH 
AEROSPACE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX AND THE BOEING SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN 
ACCOUNT FOR SIXTY PER CENT OF RECORDED EVENTS 
IN THE U. K. THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT OF THE 
PLANES AMONG THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AIRLINERS 
REGISTERED HERE IN BRITAIN FORMER 
CAPTAIN JULIAN SODDY RETIRED IN 
TWO THOUSAND AFTER FLYING THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX IN THE 
FINAL YEARS OF HIS LONG CAREER HE 
SAYS FUMES IN THE CABIN AND COCKPIT 
WERE COMMONPLACE 
THAT AEROPLANE IS 
A BRITISH AEROSPACE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX THAT IS 
WHAT I SPENT THE LAST SIX YEARS OF 
MY FLYING CAREER FLYING 
THE PROBLEM WAS WHEN YOU STARTED 
THE AUXILLIARY POWER UNIT FROM COLD 
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING 
FREQUENTLY IT WOULD FILL THE CABIN 
WITH BLACK SMOKE 
DID THIS EVER 
AFFECT THE PASSENGERS 
NOT TO THE 
EXTENT I JUST TOLD YOU BECAUSE THE 
PASSENGERS GOT ON FIRST THING IN 
THE MORNING WE SOMETIMES DID GET 
COMPLAINTS FROM THE PASSENGERS VIA 
THE CABIN STAFF BUT THE CABIN 
STAFF WERE SO USED TO IT THAT 
FREQUENTLY THEY JUST DIDN'T BOTHER 
TO TELL US 
WITHIN THE INDUSTRY 
FUMES HAVE LONG BEEN RECOGNISED AS 
A HAZARD B. A. E. BEGAN NOTIFYING 
OPERATORS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF 
CREE INCAPACITATION EIGHT YEARS AGO 
B. A. E. SAYS ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF 
FUME EVENTS ARE DUE TO OIL LEAKS IT 
SAYS IT'S UPDATED SEVENTY PER CENT OF OIL SEALS 
AND HAS NO REPORT OF FUME EVENTS 
SINCE FITTING THEM IT SAYS THE 
QUALITY OF AIR ON THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX HAS BEEN 
PROVED BY INDEPENDENT STUDIES TO 
EXCEED ALL INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS 
BOEING TOLD PANORAMA IT'S COMMITTED 
TO PROVIDING A SAFE AND HEALTHY 
CABIN ENVIRONMENT AND THAT STUDIES 
SHOW CONTAM NATIONAL LEVELS ARE LOW 
AND HEALTH AND SAFETY LEVELS ARE 
MET 
SAMANTHA SABATINO IS NOW PREPARING 
TO SUE THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY SHE 
AND HER DAUGHTER KELLY ARE ON THEIR 
WAY TO MEET SOME OF THE FOURTEEN OTHER 
PASSENGERS WHO HAVE JOINED THE 
LEGAL ACTION IN AMERICA THE ONLY 
THING THEY HAVE IN COMMON IS THE 
FLIGHT ERIC WARNER AND HIS THIRTEEN 
YEAR OLD NIECE MARY SAY THEY TOO 
CONTINUE TO SUFFER HEALTH PROBLEMS 
WHICH STARTED AFTER THE PLANE 
JOURNEY 
I HAD PAINS IN 
MY HEAD IN JOURNEY MY CHEST IN MY THROAT ACROSS MY 
NOSE EVERY JOINT ACHED L. FELT AS 
IF I WAS GOING TO DIE 
MARY HOW 
DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU GOT BACK 
HOME 
ALL OF MY FINGERTIPS WERE HOME PURPLEY LIKE BLOTCHY ON THE ENDS 
OF THEM AFTER THAT I HAD A LOT OF 
COUGHS SORE THROATS AND ACHEY 
PAINS 
IT'S ALL HAPPENED SINCE WE PAINS WENT ON HOLIDAY I'M CONVINCED THAT 
ALL OUR TROUBLES ARE STEMMING BACK 
FROM THEN L. THINK THE ONLY WAY 
YOU'RE GOING TO GET ANYWHERE IS TO 
TAKE IT THROUGH THE COURTS BECAUSE 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANYWHERE 
ANY WAY ELSE 
I AM DETERMINED TO 
FIND OUT THE TRUTH 
BECAUSE IT HAS 
AFFECTED ALL OUR LIVES ONE WAY OR 
ANOTHER HASN'T IT 
CHARLESTON IN 
WEST VIRGINIA WHERE THE PASSENGERS' 
LEGAL CASE IS BEING PREPARED THE 
PASSENGERS HAVE FOUND AN ATTORNEY 
SPECIALISING IN CHEMICAL EXPOSURE 
CASES STUART CALWELL SAYS HE'S 
FOUND EVIDENCE OF A PROBLEM ONBOARD 
THEIR FLIGHT LAST YEAR 
WE HAVE 
SOME CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 
REGARDING A FUME EVENT WE KNOW 
THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG AND WE 
YOU KNOW SOMETHING WENT WRONG ON 
THAT FLIGHT DO YOU YES 
HOW DO YES YOU KNOW THAT 
BECAUSE WE HAVE 
CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES THAT INDICATE 
THE MECHANICAL HISTORY OF THE MOST 
COMPELLING EVIDENCE IS THE 
CONSISTENT STATEMENTS THE 
CONSISTENT WITNESS OBSERVATIONS 
FROM THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ABOARD 
THAT FLIGHT 
THE AIRLINE CONCERNED 
HAS TOLD PANORAMA THERE WAS NO FUME 
EVENT ON THAT FLIGHT THAT'LL BE 
ARGUED OUT IN COURT STUART CALWELL 
SAYS THE CASE WILL FOCUS ON HIS 
CLAIM THAT PASSENGERS HAVE BEEN 
DAMAGED BY BREATHING IN CHEMICALS 
CONTAINED IN JET ENGINE OIL 
SAMANTHA AND HER FELLOW PASSENGERS 
EXHIBIT UNEQUIVOCALLY SIGNS AND 
SYMPTOMS OF ACUTE EXPOSURE WHAT 
ELSE EXPLAINS IT THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE OF VIRAL INFECTION 
BACTERIAL INFECTION MOST OTHER 
CASES THAT WOULD PRODUCE THE LONG 
LASTING COMPLAINTS THAT SAMANTHA 
AND HER FELLOW PASSENGERS HAVE HAVE 
BEEN EXCLUDED 
THERE ARE PILOTS TOO WHO COMPLAIN 
THEY'RE SUFFERING LONG TERM ILL 
HEALTH FROM REPEATEDLY BREATHING 
AIRCRAFT ENGINE FUMES OVER MANY 
YEARS IN THE AIR IN SOME CASES 
THEY SAY THEY HAVE BEEN MADE SO ILL 
THEY HAVE HAD TO STOP FLYING 
REMEMBER CAPTAIN JULIAN SODDY WHO 
RETIRED WITH ILL HEALTH EIGHT YEARS 
AGO 
EVERY TIME I FLEW THE AGO AEROPLANE AND IT GRADUALLY GOT 
WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE I WOULD 
GET SEVERE FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS 
HEADACHE TIGHTNESS OF CHEST WHICH 
OCCURRED PROBABLY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES 
AFTER GETTING AIRBORNE 
WHAT WAS IT 
THAT LED YOU TO STOP FLYING MY MY WIFE TOOK ME TO THE DOCTOR'S L. SAT 
DOWN IN HIS SURGERY IN UNIFORM AND 
HE SAID IF YOU THINK I WOULD CLIMB 
INTO THE BACK OF AN AEROPLANE WITH 
YOU AS A PILOT YOU HAVE ANOTHER 
THING COMING SO HE GROUNDED ME HE HE RETURNED TO FLYING AFTER THREE 
MONTHS BUT ONCE IN THE AIR HIS 
HEALTH PROBLEMS SOON RETURNED I I WANTED TO FLY L. HAVE ALWAYS FLOWN 
IT'S MY LIFE IT'S WHAT I AM NOT 
WHAT I DO BUT AS SOON AS I GOT 
INTO THE AEROPLANE WELL WITHIN A 
FEW DAYS THE SYMPTOMS STARTED TO 
RETURN IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY WITH 
THE SAME AEROPLANES WHICH IS 
STRANGE IT WAS A VERY VERY 
DEFINITE ILLNESS THAT WAS BROUGHT 
ABOUT BY SOMETHING BEYOND MY 
CONTROL IN THE AEROPLANE AND I'M 
AFRAID THAT WAS IT IT WAS HANG UP 
YOUR HELMET AND GOGGLES TIME 
CAPTAIN TRISTAN LORAINE'S CAREER 
FLYING BOEING SEVEN FIFTY SEVENS ENDED TWO YEARS 
AGO AFTER HE WAS GROUNDED WITH ILL 
HEALTH HIS DOCTORS SAY HIS 
SYMPTOMS ARE CONSISTENT WITH 
EXPOSURE TO FUMES HE'S TAKING PART 
IN RESEARCH TO DEVELOP A BLOOD TEST 
WHICH WILL DETECT CHEMICALS FOUND 
IN FUME EVENTS AND PINPOINT WHEN 
THAT EXPOSURE HAPPENED 
THE IDEA OF 
DEVELOPING THIS TEST IS TO PROVE 
THAT PASSENGERS AND CREWS ARE BEING 
EXPOSED TO TRICRESYL PHOSPHATES 
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT WILL PROVE 
TIME OF EXPOSURE SO WHEN PEOPLE 
HAVE DONE THE BLOOD TESTS AND THEY 
PRESENT TO AN AIRLINE AND SAY I 
WAS EXPOSED ON YOUR FLIGHT THE 
AIRLINE INDUSTRY WILL BE FORCED TO 
DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM CURRENT CURRENT AIRLINE STAFF ARE ALSO SECRETLY 
TAKING PART IN THE TESTS THIS CREW 
MEMBER SAYS SHE WAS EXPOSED TO 
FUMES JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO SHE 
DOESN'T WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED FOR 
FEAR OF LOSING HER JOB 
THE FIRST 
WARNING I HAD WAS THAT METALLIC 
TASTE IN MY MOUTH AND THAT WAS 
BASICALLY A COUGH SOON AFTER 
THERE WAS THAT REALLY STRONG SMELL 
OF BURNT PLASTIC L. FELT MY CHEST 
WAS BURNING L. STARTED COUGHING L. 
LOST MY VOICE THE BURNING 
SENSATION IN MY CHEST I HAD IT 
FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS AFTER THAT 
WHY HAVE YOU COME TO HAVE YOUR 
BLOOD TAKEN FOR TESTING TODAY 
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THESE 
SYMPTOMS I HAVE ARE GOING TO BE 
REVERSIBLE OR IF SOMETHING ELSE IN 
A FEW MONTHS OR IN A FEW YEARS' 
TIME IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND I WANT 
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON ARE ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THIS 
OF COURSE I 
AM 
WE KNOW THAT CABIN FUME EVENTS AM TAKE PLACE WE KNOW THAT FLIGHT 
CREW GET SICK WHAT WE DON'T KNOW 
IS WHETHER THEY'RE LINKED AND WHAT 
THAT LINK IS BECAUSE THE JURY IS 
OUT AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING THE 
INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES BELIEVE IT 
HAS BEEN CAUSED BY A FUME EVENT 
AND THAT'S WHAT OUR RESEARCH NOW IS 
LOOKING TO TRY TO ESTABLISH WHAT 
DOES HAPPEN AND HOW DO WE PUT IT 
RIGHT RIGHT CONFIRM CLEARANCE LANDING SOME SOME PILOTS CLAIM IT'S NOT ONLY THEIR 
HEALTH THAT'S AT RISK BUT 
FLIGHTSAFETY TOO THEY SUFFER 
SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS WHILE AT THE 
CONTROLS THIS PILOT ONLY STOPPED 
FLYING RECENTLY AND DOESN'T WANT TO 
BE IDENTIFIED 
WE CAN BE GIVEN THE 
CLEARANCE FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN BE 
CLEARED TO LAND THE AIRCRAFT IF 
THE CLEARANCE IS GIVEN QUITE A LONG 
WAY FROM THE POINT OF LANDING 
WE'LL HAVE FORGOTTEN IF WE HAVE 
RECEIVED THAT CLEARANCE SO WE JUST 
THROW OUR HANDS UP IN THE AIR 
CHECK THE RUNWAY IS CLEAR AND LAND 
BOTH PILOTS CAN BE IN THE STATE 
WHERE THEY SIMPLY CAN'T REMEMBER IF 
THEY HAVE BEEN CLEARED TO LAND AS 
THEY ARE APPROACHING THE RUNWAY 
THAT'S CORRECT 
THIRTY SIX PILOTS WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE 
BEEN AFFECTED BY FUME EVENTS HAVE 
BEEN TESTED BY A LEADING CLINICAL 
PSYCHOLOGIST 
WHAT WE'RE ASKING PSYCHOLOGIST PEOPLE TO DO IS TO JOIN UP SOME 
DOTS WHICH HAVE NUMBERS AND LETTERS 
IN THEM IN ASCENDING ORDER AND I'M 
GOING TO TIME YOU AND SEE HOW 
QUICKLY YOU CAN DO IT 
DOCTOR SARAH 
MACKENZIE ROSS CARRIED OUT A SERIES 
OF PSYCHO METRIC TESTS TO ANALYSE 
THEIR MENTAL FUNCTIONS SHE'S 
PUBLISHED RESULTS ON HOW THE FIRST 
EIGHTEEN HANDLED THE PUZZLES 
WELL DONE 
WHAT DID YOU FIND WITH THE PILOTS 
WHEN THEY TRIED THIS TEST 
WE FOUND 
THAT A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER WERE 
PERFORMING BELOW AVERAGE AND MUCH 
BELOW THE LEVEL WE'D EXPECT GIVEN 
THEIR LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE THERE 
WERE SOME CERTAIN AREAS IN WHICH 
THEY WERE WEAK AND THESE WERE TO 
DO WITH THE ABILITY TO HOLD 
INFORMATION IN MEMORY FOR SHORT 
PERIODS OF TIME THE ABILITY TO 
SWITCH THEIR ATTENTION BETWEEN 
DIFFERENT TASKS 
DOCTOR DAVID LLEWELLEN DOCTOR SARAH MACKENZIE ROSS BELIEVES 
THESE FLAWS COULD DAMAGE PILOTS' 
FLYING ABILITY 
PASSENGERS SHOULD 
BE CONCERNED AND THIS IS A 
POTENTIAL FLIGHTSAFETY ISSUE WE'VE 
GOT PILOTS SAYING THEY'RE 
STRUGGLING TO REMEMBER OR THEY'RE 
CONFUSING INFORMATION FROM AIR 
TRAFFIC CONTROL THEY'RE FEELING 
MENTALLY SLOWED DOWN AND THEY'RE 
STRUGGLING TO SHIFT THEIR ATTENTION 
BETWEEN DIFFERENT TASKS AND YET 
THESE ARE THE VERY SKILLS WE 
REQUIRE PILOTS TO HAVE 
HALF THE 
PILOTS WHO FOUND THESE PROBLEMS IN 
YOUR TESTS ARE STILL FLYING THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT HALF THE PILOTS WE SAW 
WERE EITHER RETIRED ON ILL HEALTH 
GROUNDS OR ON SICK LEAVE BUT HALF 
OF THEM WERE STILL WORKING 
SO DOES 
HER RESEARCH BACK THE PILOTS' 
CLAIMS THAT THEIR PROBLEMS ARE 
CAUSED BY TOXIC FUMES MY MY CONCLUSION IS THERE'S DEFINITELY 
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THESE PILOTS 
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXCLUDE COMMON 
CAUSES FOR IT THE PILOTS ARE 
CONCERNED THAT IT MAY BE EXPOSURE 
TO TOXIC FUMES IN THE AIRCRAFT AND 
CERTAINLY THE PATTERN AND NATURE OF 
THE DIFFICULTY THAT IS REPORT IS 
CONSISTENT WITH THAT SEEN IN OTHER 
GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
EXPOSED TO CHEMICALS THAT ARE 
POTENTIALLY TOXIC TO THE CENTRAL 
NERVOUS SYSTEM 
HER FINDINGS WENT TO A GOVERNMENT 
COMMITTEE EXAMINING CABIN AIR 
QUALITY ITS EXPERT CALLS THE 
RESEARCH EXCELLENT BUT POINTS 
OUT IT WASN'T DESIGNED TO PROVE 
WHAT CAUSED THE PILOTS' PROBLEMS 
THE COMMITTEE SAYS THAT IMMEDIATE 
HEALTH SYMPTOMS FROM FUME EVENTS 
ARE PLAUSIBLE BUT IT'S NOT 
POSSIBLE TO CONCLUDE THERE'S ANY 
LINK TO LONGER TERM ILL HEALTH IN 
AIR CREWS SO WHAT ARE WE 
PASSENGERS BREATHING IN ON EVERYDAY 
FLIGHTS OUR SECRET AIR AND SWAB 
SAMPLES FROM A BOEING SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN AT 
BRITISH AEROSPACE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX HAVE BEEN 
ANALYSED THESE SEEMED PERFECTLY 
ORDINARY FLIGHTS WITH NO FUME EVENT 
YET ALL OUR TESTS AIR AND SWAB 
CAME BACK POSITIVE WE WERE EXPOSED 
TO THE ORGANOPHOSPHATE T. C. P. ON BOTH 
FLIGHTS 
THIS MEANS WHEN YOU WERE FLIGHTS IN THE PLANE YOU WERE ENHAILING 
THIS LEVEL OF T. C. P.'S 
SO WHAT DOES 
THIS SHOW YOU ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY 
OF ENGINE OIL GETTING INTO THE AIR 
THAT PASSENGERS AND CREW BREATHE 
THIS PROVES THE FACT THAT THE OIL 
FROM THE ENGINE GETS INTO THE AIR 
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN 
BREATHING DURING THIS FLIGHT WHEN 
YOU TOOK YOUR SAMPLE THE PATHWAY 
IS THERE THE ENGINE OIL GETS INTO 
THE AIR AND PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED TO 
IT NOW WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE NOW 
WHAT ARE THE QUANTITYS 
QUANTITIES 
THE LEVELS OF THE TOXIC QUANTITIES CHEMICALS FOUNT WERE VERY LOW WELL 
WITHIN INTERNATIONAL SAFETY 
STANDARD YET THEY'RE STILL OF 
CONCERN TO PROFESSOR CHRIS VAN 
NETTEN 
THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS NETTEN ARE BASED ON NON AIRCRAFT 
SITUATIONS WE HAVE TO REALLY BE 
CAREFUL NOT TO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS 
WHEN THEY SAY THIS IS A VERY LOW 
CONCENTRATION IT'S A LOW 
CONCENTRATION BUT IN COMBINATION 
WITH MANY OTHER THINGS IF THERE IS 
A FUME EVENT YOU'RE EXPOSED TO 
MUCH HIGHER LEVELS OF THE TRICRESYL 
PHOSPHATES BOEING TOLD PANORAMA B. A. E. SYSTEMS SAY 
THEY SAY AN EARLIER STUDY INTO 
CABIN AIR CONCLUDED IT WAS 
INCONCEIVABLE THE EXTREMELY LOW 
LEVELS OF OIL CONTAMINATION FOUND 
COULD CAUSE ORGANOPHOSPHATE 
SYMPTOMS 
BOEING'S NEW DREAMLINER COMES INTO 
SERVICE NEXT YEAR THE COMPANY TOLD 
THE HOUSE OF LORDS IT WILL 
ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF OIL 
FUME EVENTS BECAUSE THE CABIN AIR 
DOESN'T COME FROM THE ENGINES 
EVENTUALLY ALL PLANES COULD HAVE 
AIR SUPPLIED THIS WAY UNTIL THEN 
PASSENGERS AND CREW WILL JUST HAVE 
TO ACCEPT THEY RISK BREATHING IN 
OIL FUMES WHEN THEY FLY 
I FEEL 
SICK COMING L. JUST HAD TO GET OUT 
AND MY HEAD WAS NUMB MY LEGS WERE 
NUMB 
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAS MADE NUMB MY CHILDREN SICK THERE'S SO MANY 
PROBLEMS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE 
SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS 
AFFECTING THE BODY FROM TOP TO 
BOTTOM I WANT PEOPLE TO RECOGNISE 
THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM GOING ON 
AND I WANT ANSWERS SAMANTHA SAMANTHA SABATINO ENDING GERRY NORTHAM'S 
REPORT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED TO 
KNOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS STARTED ITS 
OWN TESTS INTO THE AIR WE BREATHE 
IN PLANES IN WHAT THEY SAY IS THE 
FIRST RESEARCH OF ITS KIND AND 
THEIR INITIAL RESULTS ARE SHOWING 
THEY TOO HAVE FOUND THE NEUROTOXIN 
T. C. P. IN THE SAMPLES ON SUNDAY NIGHT 
A PANORAMA SPECIAL GOES INSIDE A 
TRUST THAT LOST NINETY PATIENTS TO A 
SUPERBUG THAT IS BIGGER KILLER THAN 
MRSA HOW SAFE IS YOUR HOSPITAL 
FROM C. DIFF SILL 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER
