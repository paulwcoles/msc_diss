THANK YOU 
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU 
THANK YOU 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
AS ALWAYS WE'VE BORROWED THE KEYS TO TWO FASCINATING HOMES BELONGING TO TWO FASCINATING CELEBRITIES 
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LET'S JOIN OUR OWN SUPER SLEUTH 
LISA SNOWDON AND FIND OUT WHAT'S IN STORE FOR US TODAY 
I'M IN CHELSEA NOT BARNET BUT LET'S NOT SPLIT HAIRS HERE 
IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SNIP AWAY AT A STORY 
AS LONG AS YOU FIND THE CROWNING GLORY 
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR SOME HARD TALK 
ONE THING'S FOR CERTAIN WHEN SPEAKING TO THE WORLD 
MAKE SURE YOUR FACTS ARE CORRECT THE CLUES ARE ALL THERE 
BUT WHO'S PLAYING THE GAME TODAY 
WELL PLAYING THE GAME TODAY IS OUR PANEL 
AND WHAT A PANEL THEY ARE 
THREE PERSONALITIES WITH JUST ONE THOUGHT IN MIND 
I WONDER IF WE'LL SEE IT TODAY 
OUR FIRST PANELLIST DISCOVERED HIS GIFT FOR COMEDY WHEN HE WORKED IN A VIDEO SHOP HE SAYS 
A CUSTOMER ASKED ME CAN I RENT BATMAN FOREVER 
AND I SAID NO YOU'LL HAVE TO BRING IT BACK TOMORROW 
THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF TIM VINE 
A HIGHLY RESPECTED JOURNALIST OUR NEXT PANELLIST HAS TURNED HER HAND TO NOVEL WRITING 
SHE SAYS MY LATEST BOOK HAS THE LOT 
MYSTERY SUSPENSE ACTION INTRIGUE SEX AND ADVENTURE 
MY ONLY PROBLEM IS WHAT DO I PUT ON PAGE TWO 
THE WOMAN WITH THE PROBLEM IS EVE POLLARD 
OUR THIRD PANELLIST IS A MAN WHO STARTED OUT WITH NOTHING 
AND STILL HAS MOST OF IT TODAY 
FROM OPEN HOUSE IT'S KRISTIAN DIGBY 
NOW HOW DO WE PLAY THE GAME 
WELL OUR INTREPID HOUSE DETECTIVE LISA SNOWDON 
WILL INVESTIGATE CELEBRITY HOMES UNEARTHING VITAL CLUES 
WHICH WILL ENABLE OUR PANEL TO PLAY SHERLOCK TO HER HOLMES 
AND IDENTIFY JUST WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
LET'S JOIN LISA RIGHT NOW AT HOUSE NUMBER ONE 
AND REMEMBER WATCH CLOSELY BECAUSE THE CLUES ARE THERE 
AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
I FEEL LIKE MARY POPPINS I'M ON THE ROOFTOPS OF LONDON 
CHELSEA'S JUST OVER THERE AND THE KING'S ROAD 
I WANT TO GO SHOPPING FOR THE THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN HERE 
THIS HOUSE LITERALLY TAKES MY BREATH AWAY 
I CAN CHATTER FOR ENGLAND BUT WORDS ARE IN SERIOUS DANGER OF ESCAPING ME 
THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS ASTONISHING 
IF I WERE TO PAINT EVERYTHING WHITE IN MY HOUSE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE A WHITE HOUSE 
BUT JUST LOOK AT THE SUBTLE SHADES 
THE WHITE FLOORBOARDS ARE IN COMPLETE SYMPATHY WITH THE PUTTY COLOURED WALLS 
BUT THIS IS NO BLANK CANVAS 
OBJECTS OF DESIRE ARE CAREFULLY POSITIONED TO CREATE A WORK OF ART 
BUT FOR ALL THE PERFECTION GOING ON AROUND ME 
THERE'S A WARM ATMOSPHERE AND LITTLE HOMELY TOUCHES LIKE THE DOGGIE BASKET 
THE DESIGN AND DETAIL FACTOR IN THIS ROOM AND LOOK WE'RE ONLY IN THE KITCHEN 
MEANS THAT THIS PERSON IS PASSIONATE ABOUT INTERIORS 
OR THEY HAVE A CHUM WHO'S A VERY GOOD DESIGNER 
IF THIS THING KEEPS GROWING IT'LL BE IN NEED OF A SERIOUS TRIM 
ALMOST ANYWHERE YOU POINT THE CAMERA IN THIS PLACE YOU GET A PERFECT PICTURE 
I COULD JUST IMAGINE LEGGY MODELS WITH BEAUTIFUL FLOWING HAIR 
POSING ELEGANTLY FOR A PHOTO SHOOT FOR THE LATEST SHAMPOO SAY 
NOW I WOULD EXPECT TO FIND VOGUE HERE BUT EVERY OTHER BOOK IS VERY INTERIOR DESIGN LED 
THIS IS THE HOME OF SOMEONE WHO HAS TRULY FOUND SUCCESS 
AND HAS THE CASH TO SPLASH OUT ON THE FINEST OF EVERYTHING 
IT'S A BRUSH WITH PERFECTION AND THEY OBVIOUSLY ARE INTENT ON MAKING SURE THAT NOTHING IS OUT OF PLACE 
IT'S AS THOUGH THIS HOUSE IS ALWAYS ON SHOW 
COULD THE SAME BE SAID FOR THEIR CAREER 
DID YOU NOTICE THAT THE ONLY PICTURES ON THE WALLS SEEM TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT LIKE COMBS 
THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT CELEBRITY CATEGORIES THESE DAYS CHEFS DESIGNERS 
EVEN FOOTBALLERS' WIVES 
BUT THERE ARE FEW WHO DEMONSTRATE SUCH AN EYE FOR DETAIL AND PERFECTION AS THIS PERSON HAS 
ISN'T THIS AMAZING 
HOW DO THEY KEEP IT SO SPARKLING 
THIS ISN'T A BATHROOM IT'S A SPA 
AND THIS IS A NICE TOUCH 
A T. V. SET IN THE MIRRORS 
PERHAPS SOMEONE LIKES TO WATCH WHILE THEY SHAVE 
OR DO THEIR HAIR 
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN 
THE INTERESTING ART THE HEAD START AND MORE SCISSORS THAN SOAP 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LISA 
AND NOW FOR OUR HOME AND STUDIO AUDIENCE BUT NOT FOR OUR PANEL 
HERE'S WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
TIM 
YEAH O. K. 
THIS IS CLEARLY SOMEBODY WHO HE OR SHE IS INCREDIBLY STYLISH 
STYLE MATTERS A GREAT DEAL FOR THIS PERSON YEP 
AND IT SEEMS OBVIOUS TO SAY IT BUT BECAUSE OF THE REFERENCES WERE MADE A NUMBER OF TIMES 
AND THAT'S THE POINT AT WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO HAND OVER 
TO PEOPLE WHO KNOW MORE ABOUT THESE THINGS THAN I DO 
WHAT IMPRESSIONS DO YOU DRAW AWAY FROM THAT 
FIRST OF ALL WHAT A STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE 
SECONDLY I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING FOR A CHAP HERE AREN'T WE 
WHO'S VERY CREATIVE VERY PERFECTIONIST 
AND IS QUITE SCIENTIFIC I FEEL 
SO IS THIS A MAN WHOSE PRODUCTS YOU COULD GO AND BUY 
OFF THE SHELF THIS IS WHAT WE USE EVERY DAY 
BUT HE'S ALSO VERY MUCH INVOLVED WITH PHOTO SHOOTS WITH ALL OF THAT STUFF 
SO HE'S INVOLVED WITH LONDON FASHION WEEK AND PROBABLY DOES STARS' HAIR AND ALL OF THAT 
EXACTLY KRISTIAN 
THAT WAS JUST AN AMAZING HOUSE CHELSEA BEING VERY EXPENSIVE 
OBVIOUSLY IT'S SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME YES 
I'VE NEVER SEEN A HOUSE SO COIFFURED IN MY LIFE IT WAS AMAZING WHAT CAN I SAY 
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL I LOVE THE IDEA OF HAVING A T. V. IN THE BATHROOM 
SO YOU CAN WATCH DAYTIME T. V. AS SOON AS YOU WAKE UP I LIKE THAT 
I PRESUME THEY'VE GOT A GREY OR A WHITE DOG BECAUSE THAT DOGGIE BASKET WAS PERFECT 
THE DOG WOULD HAVE TO FIT IN WOULDN'T IT YEAH 
WE'LL FIND OUT I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF THAT 
IT WAS INTERESTING THAT YOU SAID DID THEY HAVE PRODUCTS NAMED AFTER THEM 
AND THIS GOT A ROUND OF APPLAUSE MAYBE WE SHOULD GO DOWN THAT 
IT'S NOT ERIC VOSENE IS IT 
OR MR. BRILL CREAM 
YES MAYBE HIM MY GO AGAIN I'D JUST LIKE TO LEAVE 
WHAT I MEAN IS DO YOU KNOW ANY PRODUCTS THAT ARE NAMED AFTER PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW I KNOW EVERY PRODUCT 
I'VE GOT MOST OF THEM AT HOME 
DO WE THINK IT'S SOMEBODY CALLED CHARLES WORTHINGTON 
WE DO WOW 
WILL YOU COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE CHARLES WORTHINGTON 
THEY WERE VERY GOOD THEY WERE GOOD 
HELLO WELL DONE THERE IS ONE VITAL QUESTION CHARLES I MUST ASK YOU 
THAT WAS RAISED BY EVE THE VITAL QUESTION 
IS YOUR DOG WHITE GREY OR BLACK 
I LOVE THAT BLACK AND WHITE PERFECT YES 
OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE TO GO OH IT WOULD CLASH 
LITTLE BAXTER THAT'S A PERFECT ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION 
HOW OLD IS THE DOG HE'S ELEVEN 
AS I SAY SO YOU DID THE HOUSE TO GO WITH HIM 
OF COURSE YES DOGGIE FIRST THEN HOUSE 
DO DOGS GO GREY ARE YOU GOING TO GET RID OF HIM 
I'LL BE COLOURING IT DON'T YOU WORRY HE WON'T BE GOING GREY 
HE WON'T HAVE ANY ROOTS EITHER HE'LL BE DONE REGULARLY 
NOW CHARLES TELL ME 
THAT'S AN ARRESTING DIFFERENT HAIRSTYLE DOES IT HAVE A NAME TO IT 
MESSY MY MOTHER WOULD SAY 
WHEN AM I GOING TO GET A PROPER HAIRCUT SHE KEEPS SAYING TO ME REALLY YEAH TEXTURED 
TEXTURED IS THE WORD FOR THAT YES 
HOW MANY SALONS DO YOU HAVE NOW 
FOUR SALONS IN CENTRAL LONDON SO IT KEEPS ME VERY BUSY 
IN FACT THE LATEST SALON I'VE JUST DONE WHICH IS IN COVENT GARDEN 
WE CALL THE HOUSE OF CHARLES WORTHINGTON I SORT OF MODELLED IT ON THE HOUSE YOU'VE JUST SEEN 
I WANTED IT TO FEEL LIKE AN INTIMATE SPACE IT'S A GEORGIAN HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF LONDON ON FIVE FLOORS 
CUSTOMERS COMING IN GET THE FEELING OF WALKING INTO SOMEBODY'S HOME 
SO MANY SALONS NOW ARE SPRINGING UP WHICH ARE ENORMOUS SUPER SALONS 
THEY CAN BE A BIT INTIMIDATING I FEEL THE SMALLER SPACES 
WITHIN A SPACE ARE MUCH MORE APPEALING SO THAT'S VERY 
WHEN YOU SOLD YOUR PRODUCTS SIDE ALTHOUGH YOU STILL ARE ACTIVE IN IT DID YOU SELL THE SALONS AS WELL 
NO KEPT THE SALONS THE SALONS ARE STILL MY SALONS 
AND YOU HAD AS A CONSOLATION FOR GETTING RID OF THE PRODUCTS 
THERE WAS A CHEQUE FOR THIRTY SEVEN MILLION 
AS A SLIGHT CONSOLATION KIND OF YES EXACTLY YES 
IT EASES THE BLOW 
START WITH THE HOUSE LOOK AT THE STYLE IN THAT HOUSE IT'S FANTASTIC ISN'T IT 
EVE YOU SAID WHAT LOVELY COMMENTS THANK YOU 
I'D WANT TO DIE IN THAT ROOM IT'S AMAZING REALLY BEAUTIFUL 
I LOVE THE KITCHEN TABLE WITH THE COMMUNAL BENCH 
SLIGHTLY INFORMAL ALTHOUGH IT'S A VERY 
I SUPPOSE IT'S QUITE A STARK HOUSE IN TERMS OF COLOUR IT IS THE STONE COLOUR BLACK AND WHITE 
THE FURNITURE'S VERY SQUASHY SO IT FEELS COMFORTABLE IT'S A COMFORTABLE HOUSE 
THE WAY IT WAS PHOTOGRAPHED IT LOOKED LIKE NOBODY COULD LIVE THERE 
BUT I DO I COULD SEE MYSELF LIVING THERE BAXTER RUNS AROUND WITH HIS MUCKY PAWS 
AND YOU HAVE LOTS OF FIRES WHICH WERE LOVELY EXACTLY 
IT SOFTENS THE MOOD IN THE EVENING IT'S LOVELY YOU GET THE REFLECTION FROM THE FLAMES REALLY NICE 
I'M LUCKY TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE HOME 
I THINK YOU CAN ONLY HAVE A VERY MINIMALIST HOME LIKE THAT WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMEWHERE ELSE TO PUT YOUR JUNK 
COS YOU'VE GOT A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY AND IN FRANCE YES 
THOSE ARE NOT THE SAME STYLE NOT AT ALL I VERY MUCH LIKE LIVING WITH DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES 
THE COUNTRY HOUSE IS VERY MUCH DONE IN A COUNTRY THEME LOTS OF COLOUR 
I'VE GOT BRIGHT RED ROOMS YOU KNOW DEEPER COLOURED ROOMS 
AND FRANCE IS VERY PROVENCAL 
TO DO EVERYTHING THE SAME YOU'D WAKE UP EVERY DAY AND FEEL YOU WERE IN THE SAME PLACE 
WHICH I THINK IS BORING I THINK IT'S NICE TO HAVE DIFFERENT CONTRASTS AND ATMOSPHERES 
LONDON VERY MUCH IS ABOUT VERY SIMPLISTIC DESIGN 
WHICH IS VERY UNCLUTTERED WHICH UNCLUTTERS MY MIND 
WHEN YOU'RE LIVING A VERY BUSY LIFE IN LONDON IT'S NICE TO HAVE THAT SIMPLICITY AROUND YOU 
YOU STARTED STUDYING ARCHITECTURE THAT'S RIGHT 
STUDYING ARCHITECTURE YES 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO THAT YOU HAVEN'T DONE SOMETHING TO DO WITH ARCHITECTURE OR INTERIOR DESIGN 
I DESIGN ALL THE HOMES MYSELF LITERALLY FROM SCRATCH I LOVE THAT 
NO TRAINING IS EVER WASTED 
MY TIME IN ARCHITECTURE WASN'T WASTED 
I'M ABLE TO USE THAT I'M ALSO USING IT IN TERMS OF DESIGNING PACKAGING 
WITH A PRODUCT LINE IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND SHAPE AND BALANCE 
HAVING A BEAUTIFUL BATHROOM IN YOUR HOME YOU WANT BEAUTIFUL PRODUCTS 
AND THAT WAS A PREREQUISITES THE PRODUCTS HAD TO WORK ON YOUR HAIR 
BUT EQUALLY I WANTED THEM TO LOOK GORGEOUS IN THE BATHROOM SO IT'S HAVING THAT DESIGN AESTHETIC 
WHICH FLOWS THROUGH YOUR LIFE BUT IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION 
I LOVE PROPERTY AND I LOVE DESIGNING PROPERTY AND INTERIOR DESIGNING PROPERTY 
SO AS THE YEARS ROLL BY 
THAT'S ANOTHER ELEMENT I WANT TO MOVE INTO DEFINITELY 
I THINK PEOPLE SEEING THAT HOUSE YOU'LL BE GETTING A FEW LETTERS FROM PEOPLE 
WHO WANT A BIT OF INTERIOR DESIGN A BOOK AND A T. SHIRT 
HERE WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS OUR WAY 
THIS ALSO SUPERBLY DESIGNED OVER MANY YEARS BY DEDICATED ARCHITECTS AND PEOPLE 
TO PRODUCE A THROUGH THE KEYHOLE KEY FOR CHARLES WORTHINGTON THANK YOU 
WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH 
LISA IS WAITING FOR US AT HOUSE NUMBER TWO 
AND REMEMBER WATCH CLOSELY BECAUSE THE CLUES ARE THERE AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
I'M IN PRIMROSE HILL ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PLACES IN LONDON 
IT'S A SWEET ROMANTIC NAME REMINISCENT OF PICNICS WITH CUCUMBER SANDWICHES LASHINGS OF GINGER BEER 
IT'S ALSO A FANTASTIC PLACE TO BRING UP CHILDREN 
MORE TEA BUZZ 
SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A FAMILY HOME BUT WHAT KIND OF FAMILY 
WELL THERE'S A DISTINCT EASTERN FEEL TO THIS ROOM 
AND I'M REALLY RATHER ATTRACTED TO THIS BEAUTIFUL PLATE UP HERE WITH THIS ARABIC INSCRIPTION 
AND THIS STUNNING DRAWING BY FRIEDA KAHLO 
SO SOMEONE FROM SOMEWHERE HOT PERHAPS 
AND I DO LOVE THIS FIREPLACE IT'S REALLY QUITE STRIKING 
AND AGAIN FLANKED EITHER SIDE WITH EASTERN LAMPS 
SO FROM THE RUGS TO THE CHAIRS TO THE ART ON THE WALLS WE CAN TELL THAT THIS PERSON HAS EASTERN ORIGINS 
LET ME NARROW IT DOWN FOR YOU 
IT'S PAKISTAN 
NOW I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED A FEW MORE FEMININE TOUCHES BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE WORLD THIS PERSON MOVES IN 
AND THE COMPETITIVE EDGE THEY NEED TO SUCCEED THIS FITS THE BILL 
THE NEWS PLAYS A BIG PART IN THIS PERSON'S LIFE 
THESE ARE TODAY'S NEWSPAPERS 
EVERY BROADSHEET AND TABLOID AND THEY'VE ALL BEEN READ 
BUT NOT JUST THE LOCAL STORIES 
INTERNATIONAL NEWS PLAYS A BIG PART IN THIS PERSON'S LIFE 
THERE ARE SOME BEAUTIFUL PIECES FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
THIS LACQUERED CHEST SMACKS OF THE ORIENT 
SO OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE WELL TRAVELLED SNIFFING OUT SOUVENIRS AND STORIES LIKE A NEWSHOUND 
BUT NEVER THE UNDERDOG OF COURSE 
THERE'S NO INFERIOR FICTION ON THESE SHELVES BUT WHAT THERE IS 
IS AN INTEREST IN PEOPLE AND PEOPLE MAKING THE NEWS 
WE HAVE MATTHEW PARRIS HENRY KISSINGER SO THERE'S A REAL INTEREST IN INTERNATIONAL TOPICS 
AND PERHAPS SOME OLD FRIENDS 
GEORGE ALAGIAH TOBY YOUNG BORIS JOHNSON 
SO IT'S SOMEONE WHO LIKES TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY CERTAINLY BUT DEFINITELY A FUN PERSON 
THIS REALLY IS A LOVELY FAMILY HOME 
I CAN JUST IMAGINE BREAKFAST AROUND THE TABLE 
THERE'S CHAIRS FOR BIG PEOPLE CHAIRS FOR LITTLE PEOPLE TWINS PERHAPS 
AND THERE'D BE THE CHANCE OF ANOTHER PIECE OF TOAST IF MUM WOULD JUST STOP READING THE PAPERS 
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN 
THE EASTERN ORIGINS THE NEWSHOUND 
AND THE FAMILY ATMOSPHERE 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU THANK YOU LISA 
AND NOW FOR OUR HOME AND STUDIO AUDIENCE HERE'S WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
KRISTIAN IT'S OVER TO YOU 
OH MY GOODNESS WHAT AN AMAZING HOUSE I THINK THERE WERE OTHER CLUES IN THERE 
OR JUST INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE HOUSE FOR EXAMPLE 
THE SEATING AREA WAS SERIOUS SEATING AREA 
THE FURNITURE WAS ALL QUITE STERN AND I THINK WOULD 
THERE WAS NO T. V. IT KIND OF LOOKED LIKE 
ALMOST CONVERSATION AND DIALOGUE AND INTELLECTUAL THOUGHTS 
WHAT ELSE 
IS THIS PERSON A SOCIAL COMMENTATOR 
YES NOT SPECIFICALLY BUT THAT AREA 
RIGHT O. K. EVE 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY WELL TRAVELLED VERY INTELLIGENT FEMALE JOURNALIST 
WHO MAY HAVE STARTED ON NEWSPAPERS BUT NOW IS ON TELEVISION 
BECAUSE I RECOGNISE THE AUDIENCE RECOGNISED HER FACE 
UM SOMEBODY WHO'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE YOUNG TWO SMALL CHILDREN 
AND SOMEONE THERE IS A SENSE OF FUN ABOUT THAT PLACE THERE'S FANS 
AND THERE'S LOVELY ART SO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T TAKE THEMSELVES TOO SERIOUSLY SO 
WOULD BE QUITE INTERESTING ABOUT A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND WOULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT NOT JUST THE POLITICS 
BUT ABOUT THE PEOPLE LIVING THERE WOULD THAT BE RIGHT YES SPOT ON TIM LAD 
DOES THIS PERSON ACTUALLY READ THE NEWS 
DO THEY ACTUALLY READ THE NEWS 
SO THEY READ THE NEWS WELL THAT'S YES 
IS IT JUST TELEVISION OR DO THEY ALSO DO RADIO 
ERM MAINLY MAINLY TELEVISION MAINLY TELEVISION O. K. 
DID THIS PERSON BEGIN AS A REPORTER AND THEN 
SO WE'RE USED TO THEM BEING ON THE SCENE AND NOW THEY'RE BEHIND A DESK 
WAS THAT THE ORDER OF PLAY ICY GLARE FROM THE AUDIENCE 
NO THEY STARTED PROBABLY IN A SUPPORTING ROLE 
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WAS ARTHUR PERKINS BEIRUT TUESDAY 
SORT OF STUFF BUT O. K. BUT THEY GRADUATED TO THEIR POSITION NOW THE TALK OF A SENSE OF FUN 
IS THAT BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN SOMETHING WE'VE SEEN AND THOUGHT 
SHE HAS A SENSE OF FUN LIKE A COMIC RELIEF THING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS THAT WHY 
FIONA BRUCE DID THAT DIDN'T SHE BUT IT'S NOT FIONA BRUCE 
YES SOMETHING LIKE STRICTLY COME DANCING OR DANCING ON ICE NO 
NO NO OF COURSE NOT THAT WASN'T MY IDEA 
EVE TOLD ME TO SAY THAT STOP IT 
STOP IT WITH YOUR SILLY IDEAS 
ZERO IN ZERO IN 
YOU'VE GOT THE EVIDENCE YOU HAVE ASSEMBLED THE EVIDENCE MY FRIEND 
SHE'S A NEWSCASTER SHE READS THE NEWS YEAH 
AND YOU GATHERED THAT SHE HAS WORLD CONNECTIONS 
RIGHT IS SHE AN ASIAN GIRL 
I REALLY AM GONNA KICK MYSELF I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I CAN'T THINK OF ANYBODY'S NAME 
I REALLY AM GONNA KICK MYSELF 
I CAN'T THINK OF HER NAME I'M GONNA KICK BOTH OF THEM 
YOU SEE HER PARTICULARLY ON A SUNDAY NIGHT I THINK 
OH ANYWAY WE'LL FIND OUT OH NO JUST GETTING MYSELF COMFORTABLE 
THERE YOU GO 
I HAVE NO IDEA I'M ALL OUT 
I KNOW HER FACE 
YOU WILL KICK YOURSELF YOU KNOW THIS YOU KNOW THIS I KNOW I KNOW IT 
DOES SHE HAVE LONG HAIR OR SHORT HAIR I THINK IT'S LONG ABOUT THERE 
QUITE LONG AND SLICK IS IT 
I HAVEN'T LOOKED TODAY SHE'S WEARING IT UP IN A BUN 
SHE'S BEEN IN PURDAH NOT IN THE TECHNICAL SENSE OF THE WORD BUT SO YOU DIDN'T SPOT HER 
I CAN'T BEAR IT IT'S REALLY IRRITATING ME AND IT WILL DO FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
WELL IT'S VERY GOOD NEWS WHEN SHE'S ON THE NEWS BECAUSE IT'S MISHAL HUSSEIN 
SO MISHAL HUSSEIN WILL YOU COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
THANK YOU 
HELLO 
WELL THEY WERE THEY WERE CLOSE WEREN'T THEY 
THEY WERE CLOSE BUT STRUGGLING THEY WERE YOU HAD TO END IT THERE 
YES YES I WAS GOOD ON THE HAIRDO 
I FEEL SO BAD BECAUSE I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT YOU LOOKED LIKE 
I'VE INTERVIEWED EVE SO MANY TIMES ON SO MANY B. B. C. PROGRAMMES THAT I'M GOING TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY 
OH PLEASE DON'T BUT I HAVE JUST HAD MY HAIR CUT 
SO YOU WERE VERY CLOSE THE IMAGE WAS THERE ABSOLUTELY 
YOU STARTED GROWING UP TRAVELLING AROUND THE WORLD 
I DID BECAUSE MY FAMILY ARE FROM PAKISTAN I STILL HAVE RELATIVES IN INDIA AS WELL 
AND I GREW UP IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THOSE ARE STILL THE PARTS OF THE WORLD I GO TO THE MOST ON WORK 
I MEAN I'VE LIVED IN THE STATES AS WELL SO IT'S 
IT'S A INTERNATIONAL BACKGROUND AND I SUPPOSE EVEN AS I LOOKED AT THE HOUSE AS AN OUTSIDER AS IT WERE 
I THINK IT IS ALL REFLECTED THERE 
THE RANGE OF BOOKS THERE TOO 
YES I'M A BIG READER AND I GO THROUGH DIFFERENT PHASES 
I OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO READ QUITE A LOT AROUND WORK YES 
I HAD THREE CHILDREN IN TWO YEARS SO I WENT THROUGH A PHRASE OF READING EVERY BABY BOOK KNOWN TO MAN 
THEN GETTING MYSELF IN SUCH A MUDDLE THAT MY HUSBAND BANNED ME FROM READING ANY MORE 
SO BUT YOU KNOW I TRY TO READ AS MUCH CURRENT FICTION AS I CAN AS WELL 
BUT DO YOU FIND WHAT HAPPENS TO ME THAT 
IF YOU'RE ON TELEVISION OR SOMETHING YOUR LIBRARY IS HALF BOOKS THAT YOU WANTED TO HAVE 
AND HALF BOOKS THAT WERE SENT IN COMPLEMENTARILY YOU KNOW HOPING YOU'D MENTION THEM ON THE SHOW 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN YES I SUSPECT YOU HAVE MORE OF THOSE THAN I DO BUT 
WELL I'VE GOT A FEW THAT I CAN PASS OVER BECAUSE 
I MEAN SOMEONE SAID TO ME THE OTHER DAY DAVID WHY HAVE YOU GOT SIX BOOKS BY BARBARA CARTLAND 
DO YOU LOVE HER WORK NO IT'S JUST THAT SOMEONE WANTED ME TO DO A T. V. SERIES ABOUT HER 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN YEAH SO YOU GET A MIXTURE OF PERSONALITIES 
YEAH I KNOW NOT ALL OF THEM ARE NECESSARILY WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE HAND PICKED YOURSELF IT'S TRUE 
WITH ALL YOU DO IN OBVIOUSLY THE PLACE WHERE YOU WERE BORN AND SO ON PAKISTAN 
BUT IF YOU SUDDENLY HAD A LONG ASSIGNMENT THREE YEARS IN THE STATES 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT OR WOULD YOU FIND THAT I WOULD UNSETTLING 
I THINK YOU KNOW I LOVED MY TIME AS A WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT 
IT WAS JUST WHEN THE IRAQ WAR WAS BEGINNING SO THERE WAS 
IT WAS JUST A FANTASTIC PLACE TO BE A JOURNALIST I MEAN YOU KNOW WASHINGTON THERE'S ALWAYS A STORY 
SO I THINK THE STATES IS FASCINATING 
IT'S ALSO A GREAT PLACE TO BE AN ANCHOR AND I THINK YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO'S BEEN BRITISH 
AND TRIED TO MAKE IT IN THAT MARKET IS TRYING TO FOLLOW IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS ACTUALLY 
BUT YOU KNOW AMERICA IS A GREAT PLACE FOR THAT KIND OF RECOGNITION AS A T. V. NEWS ANCHOR 
SO YOU'D HAPPILY GO BACK THERE I THINK I WOULD 
WASHINGTON IS A VERY EASY PLACE TO FEEL AT HOME IN ONCE YOU LIVE THERE 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT FROM THE OUTSIDE OFTEN 
BUT IT'S A FANTASTIC INTERNATIONAL CITY FULL OF INTERESTING PEOPLE 
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS NOW WHAT WOULD YOU PARTICULARLY LIKE TO DO MORE OF THE SAME 
YES I'M STARTING TO NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO DO MUCH WORK ON LOCATION FOR A WHILE BECAUSE OF 
YOU KNOW MY TRIBE OF LITTLE BOYS I'M NOW STARTING TO GET BACK INTO THE FIELD MORE 
SO I WAS JUST IN PAKISTAN WHEN BENAZIR BHUTTO WAS ASSASSINATED 
I'M STARTING TO DO MORE INTERVIEWING WORK ON RADIO FOUR FOR INSTANCE SO 
I'M KIND OF IN A NEW PHASE REALLY WHERE I'M STARTING TO SPREAD MY WINGS AGAIN 
IN FACT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER NINE ELEVEN AFFECTED YOU TOO DIDN'T IT 
YES I MEAN I WAS PART OF THE REPORTING OF NINE ELEVEN 
I WAS A BUSINESS JOURNALIST AT THE TIME SO I WAS REPORTING ON THE RESURGENCE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS 
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IT WAS ALSO A KEY MOMENT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW I WAS A BRITISH MUSLIM JOURNALIST 
AND NONE OF THOSE ASPECTS OF MY IDENTITY HAD BEEN A BIG DEAL 
BUT IT SORT OF MARKED PROBABLY AN AWAKENING OF MY OWN INTEREST IN MY OWN HERITAGE SO I THINK IT WAS 
IT WAS THE START OF A FASCINATING PHASE PROFESSIONALLY 
BECAUSE MUCH OF WHAT WE DO IN THE INTERNATIONAL NEWS TODAY IS 
YOU KNOW GOES BACK TO SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH BUT ALSO I THINK A PHASE IN MY GROWING UP PERSONALLY AS WELL 
AND REALLY LOOKING AGAIN AT WHO I AM 
AFTER NINE ELEVEN AND ALL THAT DID YOU FIND YOURSELF IN CASUAL ENCOUNTERS WITH PEOPLE 
EITHER IN NEW YORK OR IN LONDON 
DID YOU FIND THEM WARY OR DIFFERENT 
I MEAN BECAUSE OF 
PARTIALLY PREJUDICE OR PARTIALLY FEAR OR 
I HAVE TO SAY I WAS ASKED THE QUESTION YOU KNOW ARE YOU RELATED TO SADDAM HUSSEIN 
WHICH I DON'T THINK I WOULD EVER HAVE BEEN ASKED IN BRITAIN 
BUT I WAS ASKED THAT QUESTION IN THE STATES WHICH IS A BIT UNFORTUNATE 
BUT YOU KNOW IN MOST WAYS I THINK AMERICANS ARE 
THEY'RE KEEN TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE YOUR PARENTS CAME FROM 
WHICH MANY PEOPLE IN BRITAIN WOULD PROBABLY STRAY AWAY FROM IN CASE IT WAS CONSTRUED AS OFFENSIVE 
SO I THINK THAT AMERICAN CURIOSITY AND THAT QUESTIONING IS OVERALL A VERY POSITIVE THING 
AND I'VE GENERALLY ALWAYS HAD SOME GOOD FEEDBACK EVEN IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF NINE ELEVEN 
EVEN IN THE STATES YEAH OH WELL IT'S NOT SURPRISING BECAUSE OF YOUR GREAT CHARM AS WELL 
SO HERE IS THE THROUGH THE KEYHOLE KEY THANK YOU 
IT'S OUR WAY OF SALUTING YOU 
SOMETHING 
DON'T DROP IT ON ANY OF THE BOYS 
NO HOW OLD ARE THEY NOW THEY ARE THREE AND TWINS OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO 
FANTASTIC IT'S QUITE SOMETHING THREE BOYS THREE BOYS 
I SHALL PUT THIS ON THE MANTELPIECE FASTENED ON THE MANTELPIECE 
THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR HAVING US OUR HUGE THANKS TO MISHAL HUSSEIN 
AND OF COURSE TO CHARLES WORTHINGTON AS WELL 
NOT TO MENTION OUR PANEL 
TIM VINE 
EVE POLLARD 
AND KRISTIAN DIGBY 
UNTIL THE NEXT TIME GOODBYE FOR NOW 
PLAN'S GOOD 
MO I'M IN 
BOYS ARE BRIEFED 
AND HASN'T HE GOT A SAFE 
ABOUT AS SUBTLE AS A FLYING BRICK 
WAH AH AH

ARE YOU SURE 
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING 
IS IT ALWAYS WRONG TO LIE ABSOLUTELY

LAST THING I REMEMBER IS THIS MAN WHAT MAN 
THE GUY WITH THE HORN RIMMED GLASSES
