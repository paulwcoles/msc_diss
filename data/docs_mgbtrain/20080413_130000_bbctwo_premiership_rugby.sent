WELCOME TO KINGSHOLM HOME OF DEAN 
RYAN'S GLOUCESTER WHO MAY HAVE 
TITLE WINNING TALENT BUT DO THEY 
HAVE THE MENTAL STRENGTH TO FINISH 
THE JOB THEY HAVE LOST THEIR LAST 
THREE MATCHES THEY NEED NOTHING 
LESS THAN A WIN TO STAY TOP TODAY 
EXCUSE ME THANK YOU SARACENS 
MEANWHILE ARE DESPERATE TO GET KICK 
OFF UNDER WAY A SENSATIONAL 
DISPLAY BY THEIR FORWARD PACK LAST 
WEEKEND SAW THEM BEAT OSPREYS FOR A 
PLACE IN THE CITY FINAL OF THE 
HEINEKEN CUP FOR THE FIRST TIME 
QUESTION IS CAN THEY BACK IT UP 
DEAN RYAN HAS MADE FIVE CHANGES TO 
HIS SIDE IAIN BALSHAW REPLACES 
PSALTER SON ON THE WING AND TINDALL 
STARTS HIS FIRST MATCH SINCE 
DAMAGING HIS LIVER IN THE SIX 
NATIONS MUCH WILL HE PARTNER JAMES 
SIMPSON DANIEL IN MIDFIELD SARS 
SENSE ARE WITHOUT INJURED ANDY 
FARRELL AND WILL MISS RICHARD HILL 
WHO GETS A REST AFTER HIS 
PERFORMANCE LAST WEEKEND AND 
RICHARD HAUTHEN FOR ENGLAND MAYBE 
JONO CAN ANSWER THAT WHEN AND WHOM 
WITH IS THE QUESTION ONE THING IS 
FOR SURE THAT MAN IS STAYING PUT 
WITH ONLY FOUR ROUNDS REMAINING 
JUST THREE POINTS SEPARATE THE TOP 
FIVE TEAMS 
KINGSHOLM IS FAMOUS FOR ITS PART 
STAND AND PASSIONATE FANS JUST A 
STONE'S THROW FROM THE SHED IS NOT 
JUST ANY OLD BOOZER BUT A PUB OWNED 
BY ENGLAND AND GLOUCESTER LEGEND 
MIKE IT EAGUE HE TEAGUE HE 
PROMISE ME A PINT IT'S A BIT OF A 
MECCA FOR RUGBY FANS ON MATCH DAY 
YEAH IT'S BECOMING A BIG OCCASION 
IT'S A GOOD JOB WE DIDN'T DO THIS 
LAST WEEK BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T 
HAVE GOT IN THROUGH THE DOOR FULL FULL OF MAD IRISHMEN GLOUCESTER HAVE 
BEEN UP AND DOWN THE LAST FEW 
WEEKS HAVEN'T GONE AS WELL DO YOU 
THINK THEY HAVE THE MENTAL STRENGTH 
TO GO RIGHT THROUGH AND GET INTO 
THE PLAY OFFS 
I THINK PROBABLY FOR GLOUCESTER 
THE SEASON IS THIS GAME TODAYS IT 
JUST BASICALLY THEY HAVE TO WIN AT 
ALL COSTS THAT IS IT L. THINK FOR 
THE YOUNG PLAYERS THAT MENTAL 
HARDNESS HAS TO COME THROUGH YOU YOU HAVE YOUR MATE PETER WINTERBOTTOM 
ALONGSIDE YOU WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 
THIS YOUNG TEAM 
I THINK IT'S A 
VERY EXCITING TEAM THEY HAVE SOME 
GOOD YOUNG PLAYERS LAMB IS A 
FANTASTIC TALENT WHAT THE TEAM 
LACKS IS MAYBE A BIT OF GRUNT 
UPFRONT THEY STRUGGLED LAST WEEK 
AGAINST MUNSTER L. THINK THEY 
PROBABLY NEED A LITTLE MORE UPFRONT 
COULD DO WITH A COUPLE OF FELLAS 
LIKE YOU IN THE PACK TALKING ABOUT 
GRUNT UP FRONT THAT WAS FANTASTIC 
DISPLAY BY SARACENS AGAINST OSPREYS 
IS THAT WHERE THE THREAT WILL COME 
TODAY SNO FOR THEIR GAME THE 
CONFIDENCE HAS TO BE RIGHT UP THERE 
IN THE TEAM RIGHT THROUGHOUT THEY 
KNOW THEY CAN DO IT BUT THEY STILL 
HAVE TO COME TO KINGSHOLM AND 
HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE THE TESTING 
THING TODAY THAT THE CROWD CAN GET 
BEHIND THE PLAYERS DON'T THINK 
WE CAN GET TOO LOSSES IN TWO WEEKS 
REALLY SO I AM HOPING THEY CAN DO 
IT 
IN PUBS UP 
AND DOWN THE COUNTRY IT AND RUGBY CLUBS A LOT OF TALK THIS 
WEEK ABOUT MARTIN JOHNSON COMING 
ON BOARD WHAT DO YOU THINK OF 
THAT 
IF A GUY LIKE MARTIN JOHNSON THAT PETER TALKED ABOUT OOMPH IN THE 
SIDE THAT IS THE KIND OF GUY AND 
STEEL THAT ENGLAND NEED APPLAUD IT 
I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC HE IS A TOP 
MAN PERFECT 
WHAT ABOUT YOU 
WELL IN MANY RESPECTS HE IS ON 
UNKNOWN QUALITY BECAUSE HE HAS 
NEVER MANAGED TO TEAM BEFORE IT'S 
GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM 
IF HE GETS ENOUGH SUPPORT AND HE 
MAKES THE RIGHT DECISION HE WILL BE 
FINE THERE IS A LOT OF WATER TO 
FLOW UNDER THE BRIDGE OVER THIS ONE 
THE WITH THE WAY THE RFU HAVE 
HANDLED IT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY POOR 
ROB ANDREW IS UNDER AN EXTREME 
PRESSURE SO HOPEFULLY IT WILL ALL 
COME TOGETHER IF ANYONE IS GOING 
TO DO IT PROBABLY JONO CAN LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT TODAY'S GAME A QUICK 
PREDICTION PREDICTION I 
THINK GLOUCESTER WILL WIN THINK IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR 
SARACENS TO GET UP AND PLAY AS WELL 
AS THEY DID LAST WEEK GLOUCESTER 
DON'T LOSE HERE VERY OFTEN SO MY 
MONEY IS ON GLOUCESTER 
WHAT ABOUT 
YOU YOU IF THEY CAN START LIKE THEY 
I THINK THEY WILL JUST ABOUT GET IT 
THERE IS A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THEY 
ARE PLAYING WELL L. THINK THEY CAN 
PUT THESE GUYS UNDER PRESSURE 
WITHOUT DOUBT IT'S A SARACENS WIN TODAY 
I WAS GOING TO SAY IT WILL TODAY BE ONE SIDED TOWARDS GLOUCESTER 
SAYING THAT I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN THEM 
THE KISS OF DEATH 
TIME IS RUNNING 
OUT THEY GET MORE IMPORTANT NOW 
IT BECOME MORSE DIFFICULT TO START 
TALKING ABOUT DEVELOPMENT AND NEXT 
WEEK AND THE WEEK AFTER THEY ARE 
RUNNING OUT FOR US WITH FOUR GAMES 
THREE OF THEM AT HOME IF WE GET A 
GOOD WIN TODAY WE HAVE ANOTHER WEEK 
AT HOME WHERE WE CAN BUILD ON THAT 
AND THEN WE ARE IN THE MIX 
TWO TOUGH GAMES COMING TO 
KINGSHOLM DE SPITE BEING BEATEN 
LAST WEEK WE HAVE PROUD ROUD 
BUT WE KNOW IT WILL BE TOUGH WE WE HAD A LOT OF STICK BUT YET WE ARE 
THE TOP TEAM IN ENGLAND 
GLOUCESTER ARE STRONG ACROSS THE 
PITCH DEAN IS A GOOD COUCH AND HE 
HAS PUT TOGETHER STRONG SQUAD WE 
KNOW IT WILL BE TOUGH UP FRONT 
TIATIA AND WOOD WITH BORTOLAMI 
VERY STRONG IT'S GOING TO BE A 
HUGE BATTLE FOR THE FORWARDS THEY 
HAVE FLEET FOOTED BACKS TALKING TALKING ABOUT FLEET FOOTED BACKS A LOT OF 
HEADLINES ABOUT A MAN IN YOUR TEAM 
TIPPED TO PLAY FOR ENGLAND WHAT 
DID YOU MAKE OF THAT 
I THINK HE 
HAS BEEN PLAGUE WELL ALL YEAR HE 
HAS BEEN OUR MOST PLAYING WELL 
ALL YEAR HE HAS BEEN OUR MOST 
CONSISTENT PLAYER IT'S GREAT TO 
SEE HE HAS GOT THE RECOGNITION HE 
CONVERTED THE FULL FIFTEEN I THINK HE 
HAS COME FORWARD A LONG WAY L. L. 
DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE WILL OR WON'T 
GET REPRESENTATION THIS YEAR BUT 
THE WAY HE IS PLAYING HE DEFINITELY 
DESERVES IT 
WE HAVE TO START WELL 
THEY WILL BE FULL OF CONFIDENCE AND 
I DONTS THINK ANYONE WILL NOT HAVE 
LOOKED AT LAST WEEK AND GIVEN 
CONGRATULATIONS L. THOUGHT WE WERE 
OUTSTANDING AGAINST ONE OF THE FORM 
EUROPEAN SIDES THE FIRST TWENTY THIRTY 
MINUTES IS CRUCIAL TO US IF WE CAN 
GET A GOOD START WE CAN HOPEFULLY 
GET EVERYONE BEHIND US 
O. K. WE HAVE 
HEARD WHAT EVERYONE HAS TO SAY BUT 
THE TIME FOR TALKING IS OVER L. AM 
GOING TO FIND MY SEAT IN THIS 
FANTASTIC NEW STAND LET'S GET TO 
THE MATCH 
A WEEK ON FROM THE EUROPEAN EXIT 
THEY ARE LOOKING GOOD 
SO HERE COME THE MEN IN BLACK LED 
BY THEIR SOUTH AFRICAN SKIPPER IT 
WOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE IF THESE 
PLAYERS AND THE FANS ARE STILL 
HOVERING SOMEWHERE ABOVE WATFORD 
AFTER THAT THRILLING PERFORMANCE 
LAST SUNDAY CAN THEY FOLLOW IT UP 
AT KINGSHOLM TODAY HERE COME 
GLOUCESTER HOW WILL THEY DEFEND A 
WEEK ON FROM THAT SICKENING DEFEAT 
AGAINST MUNSTER FOUR PREMIERSHIP 
GAPES TO GO THEY KNOW THERE IS 
STILL A BIT OF WORK TO BE DONE 
BEFORE THE PLAY OFFS ARE SECURED THE REFEREE TODAY IS ROB DEBNEY 
THERE HAS BEEN A BIT OF RAIN IN THE 
WEST COUNTRY BUT IT'S FINE AND DRY 
FOR THE TIME BEING AT KINGSHOLM 
RICHARD HOUGHTON GETS THE FIRST 
CLEARING KICK AWAY SHANE WILLIAMS 
HAD HIS POCKET A WEEK AGO BUT A 
DIFFERENT CHALLENGE TODAY IT WAS WON BY NARRAWAY 
LAWSON THE SCRUM HALF LAMB A 
LITTLE SHORT BALL TO TINDALL 
BOTH SIDES ARE SHOWING A 
WILLINGNESS TO RUN WITH THE BALL IN 
THE WEST COUNTRY SUNSHINE 
PRECISION NOT QUITE THERE AT THE 
MOMENT BUT IT BODES WELL DIRECTOR DIRECTOR OF RUGBY ALAN GAFFE KNEE WHAT KIND 
OF LEGACY IS HE LEAVING A GOOD ONE 
THE BALL IS LOOSE MATT SKIRVING 
NEED TO SCUTLE BACKWARDS TO MAKE 
SURE THEY HELD ON TO IT 
CHRIS CHESS KNEE TAKES IT ON AN 
EXTRA METRE NOW DE KOCK CAN FIRE 
AWAY JACKSON DOESN'T FIND TOUCH 
IAIN BALSHAW GIVEN THE INVITATION 
TO STRETCH HIS LEGS HE RUNS INTO 
SORRELL THIS IS BORTOLAMI 
LAWSON MAKING SURE THAT GLOUCESTER 
ARE KEEPING THIS HIGH TEMPO GOING 
SIMPSON DAN IDEAL GOES TO GROUND 
SIMPSON DANIEL GOES TO GROUND A 
LITTLE BREAK FROM LAMB TOM RYDER 
NEEDED TO BE ALERT AND HE WAS IT'S 
STILL GLOUCESTER INTERESTING CHIP 
AHEAD FOR IAIN BALSHAW HORNTON 
NEEDED TO BE ALERT ALTHOUGH HE 
SLIPS HE WILL THINK HE DID HIS JOB 
AT FULL BACK VERY WELL LAWSON 
HANGING ON TO THE BALL A SECOND OR 
TWO LONGER THAN HE MIGHT HAVE DONE 
THERE WAS THE LITTLE BREAK FROM 
RYAN LAMB 
THE TANTALISING CHIP AIMED FOR IAIN 
BALSHAW THE MAN WHO USUALLY PLAYED 
ON THE WING DID A FULL BACK JOB 
VERY WELL STILL BIG DEFENCIVE 
MOMENT THESE FOR SARACENS 
GLOUCESTER HAVE DONE THE FIRST JOB 
THEY HAVE SECURED THE LINE OUT A 
LITTLE DRY FROM IT FORCE THEY WILL 
HAVE THE SCRUM THERE'S MORE THAN A HINT OR TWO 
THAT GLOUCESTER ARE BEGINNING TO 
WOBBLE AS THE DAYS GET LONGER AND 
THE SEASON'S CONCLUSION DRAWS IN THEY'VE GOT THE FIRST TRY JAMES 
SIMPSON DANIEL SIMPLE ENOUGH BUT 
WELL WORKED FROM THE ATTACKING 
SCRUM THE FORWARDS DID THEIR JOB 
AND THE BACKS WERE GIVEN THE BALL 
AND SIMPSON THE FINAL LIMING IN 
THE CHAIN THERE WAS STILL WORK FOR WILLY WALKER TO DO THERE THE EXTRA TWO POINTS ARE ADDED BY 
RYAN LAMB JUST PAST HIS CENTURY OF 
PREMIERSHIP POINTS FOR THE SEASON 
AND GLOUCESTER LEAD BY SEVEN TO ZERO LAMB HELD UP BY DE KOCK VAINIKOLO TRIES TO KICK IT OPEN THE SECOND OF THE AFTERNOON THEY ARE BEGINNING TO HIT TOP GEAR AGAIN AND DISAPPOINTED NOT ON THIS 
OCCASION THE EXTRA TWO POINTS FOR 
RYAN LAMB HE WILL HEAD OFF TO HAVE 
THAT BLOOD INJURY SORTED OUT SARACENS JUST BEGINNING TO COME 
BACK INTO IT OVER THE LAST FEW 
MINUTES JUST BEGINNING TO GET SOME 
CONTROL HE'S LOST THE BALL THERE ILLEGALLY 
WAS THAT ALEX BROWN WITH THE 
INITIAL HAND 
IT'S A PENALTY FOR SARRIES SARACENS HAVE THEIR FIRST THREE 
POINTS OF THE MATCH OFF THE PUT OF 
GLEN JACKSON GLOUCESTER JUST BEGINNING TO SENSE 
HAVING DEFENDED FOR TEN MINUTES OR 
SO THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE LAST 
WORD THEY WILL HAVE AT LEAST THREE POINTS WITH THIS PENALTY IS THIS WHERE LAMB GOT INJURED GLOUCESTER HAVE GONE FOR THE POSTS THREE POINTS BEFORE THE BREAK THAT 
MAKES GLOUCESTER THE FAVOURITES TO 
WIN THIS ONE THAT IS HALF TIME 
IT'S BEEN A TERRIFIC FIRST FORTY 
MINUTES GLOUCESTER HAVE BOSSED IT 
POINTS WISE THEY LEAD BY FIFTEEN TO THREE UNDER WAY GLOUCESTER HAVE MADE THE 
CHANGE IN THE BACK ROW GARETH 
DELVE IS ON SARACENS WITH RESTART THAT'S A TERRIFIC KICK REALLY PROSPECT RYAN LAMB WAS DE KOCK IN TOUCH THERE THE 
EVER HELPFUL SHED HEADS THOUGHT HE 
WAS WHAT A RUN FROM LAMB THAT IS 
FANTASTIC THAT IS AN OUTSTANDING 
SCORE FROM RYAN LAMB WHAT MOMENT OF BRILLIANCE IT ALL CAME FROM THAT POOR CLEARANCE GLOUCESTER HAVE A THIRD TRY LAMB ADDS THE TWO POINTS TO HIS OWN 
HANDIWORK AND VERY QUICKLY AT THE 
START OF THE SECOND HALF GLOUCESTER 
HAVE STRETCHED THAT LEAD TO NINETEEN 
POINTS BRILLIANT IF SARACENS ARE GOING TO GET 
ANYTHING OUT OF THIS MATCH THEY 
WILL NEED TO START SCORING POINTS 
PRETTY SHARPISH JUST THE THREE TO 
SHOW SO FAR A GLEN JACKSON PENALTY 
IN THE FIRST HALF WALKER WAS JUST OUTSIDE HIS TWENTY TWO 
ONLY BY COUPLE OF STEPS THE REFEREE SAID THAT SARACENS HAVE GOT TO START MAKING THE MOST OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES THE MAN OF THE MOMENT ENJOYING THE 
SUNSHINE EVEN IN THESE EARLY 
PHASES OF THE SECOND HALF HAS 
SEEMINGLY PUT THE LID ON THIS MATCH 
FOR THE CHERRY AND WHITES TWO 
TRIES IN AS MANY MINUTES FOR RYAN 
LAMB AT THE START OF THE SECOND 
HALF AND GLOUCESTER ARE CHARGING 
AWAY SARACENS HAVING TO PRESS BUT JUST PRESSING TOO HARD BRIAN LAMB HAS SCORED SEVENTEEN POINTS ON HIS OWN IN THIS GAME ZEF HE'S GOT HIS BREATH BACK 
RECOVERED HIS COMPOSURE AND LAMB'S 
PERSONAL HAUL MOVES UP ANOTHER 
COUPLE OF POINTS TO NINETEEN GLOUCESTER TWENTY NINE SARACENS THREE RYAN LAMB THE MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT SARACENS NOT LACKING FOR SPEED SARACENS HAVE TO GET THE NEXT TRY TO MAKE A MATCH OF THIS SHORT PASS FROM GLEN JACKSON 
A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR POWELL BUT 
THEY GET THE PENALTY ANY WAY 
GLOUCESTER WERE OFF SIDE DAVID SEYMOUR RIGHT IN THE THICK OF THINGS NOT GOING ANY FURTHER 
SARACENS HAVE THE SCRUM WHERE WILL SARACENS GO EVERYONE LINED UP ON THIS OPEN SIDE DE KOCK MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE'S IN THE RIGHT POSITION LOOK AT THE CHARGE IT TOOK THREE SARACENS PLAYERS TO HAUL HIM DOWN 
ALMOST REVEALING HIS UNDERWEAR HE 
IS A MONSTER WHEN HE GETS GOING A PRESSURE THROW THIS SO CLOSE TO 
YOUR OWN LINE THERE IS NO ROOM FOR 
ERROR LAWSON MANSION TO GET THAT BALL AWAY DAHL OF BRINGS THE BALL AWAY THIS IS LESLEY VAINKOLO THIS WOULD 
BE A THRILLING TRY LESLEY VAINKOLO 
WITH THE FOURTH TRY FOR THE CHERRY 
AND WHITES A KISS OF THE BALL AND 
A BONUS POINT AS WELL OUTSTANDING 
COUNTERATTACK RUGBY FROM GLOUCESTER 
THAT IS THE MATCH AND ANOTHER 
SCORE IN TERRIFIC DOMESTIC SEASON 
FOR LESLEY VAINKOLO THAT WAS THE 
KEY BALL LAMB SENSED THERE WAS 
ACRES OF SPACE ON THAT LEFT HAND 
SIDE AND LESLEY VAINKOLO BOOF FOR 
FORCE DAN SCARBOROUGH WON'T LIKE WATCHING 
THAT BACK TOO OFTEN TRIED TO GO 
LOW BUT HE WAS SHOULDERED AWAY BY 
THE MIGHTY SOUTH SEA ISLANDER GLOUCESTER THIRTY FOUR SARACENS THREE I THINK WE KNOW WHO WILL WIN THE 
MATCH IT'S NOW DAMAGE LIMITATION 
FOR THE HEINEKEN CUP CITY FINALISTS BACK YOU GO GO BACK RIGHT BACK ONGARO SIMPSON DANIEL LESLEY 
VAINKOLO LOVELY AGAIN TO SIMPSON 
DANIEL WHO CARRIED ON TO PROVIDE 
SUPPORT IN DANGER OF BECOMING 
ROUTE THIS THE BALL WAS KNOCKED ON 
LOOK AT THE DETERMINATION AS 
GLOUCESTER CLEAR THE BODIES TO 
RELEASE THE BALL ANY SENSE THAT 
GLOUCESTER WERE BEGINNING TO WOBBLE 
IN THE PREMIERSHIP HAS BEEN BLOWN 
AWAY WITH THIS PERFORMANCE THEY 
QUICKLY HAVE REDISCOVERED THEIR 
EARLY SEASON FORM LAMB SENSES 
THERE WAS SPACE HE WAS RIGHT THAT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC MARCO 
BORTOLAMI WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE 
END OF ONE OF THE MORE 
EXTRAORDINARY TRIES OF THE SEASON 
IF IAIN BALSHAW HAD MANAGED TO GET 
THAT BASKETBALL PASS BACK TO THE 
ITALIAN WITH MORE ACCURACY LAMB 
DELIVERED TO PERFECTION 
BALLESTEROS JUST LITTLE 
OVEREXCITED BUT THAT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT EVEN 
AS TALL AS BORTOLAMI IS HE IS NOT 
THAT TALL GRET TO WATCH LET'S GO THE BALL IS OUT WELL 
PICKED UP BY GARETH DELVE OFF THE 
BASE OF THE SCRUM HE SO OFTEN 
MAKES SUCH AN IMPACT COMING OFF 
THE BENCH WHETHER IT'S FOR THE RED 
AND WHITE OF GLOUCESTER OR THE RED 
AND WHITE OF WALES SUCH DYNAMIC 
PLAYER IN THE BACK ROW THE FORMER 
BATH MAN LAMB BEGINING TO OPEN HIS MAGICAL 
BOX OF TRICKS THAT ONE DIDN'T WORK 
BUT HE WILL GET THE PENALTY L. 
THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE CARD 
HERE IT'S FOR TOM RYDER WHEN YOU 
ARE THIRTY FOUR TO THREE DOWN WITH AN HOUR OF THE 
MATCH GONE YOU REALLY DON'T NEED 
THAT THERE IS THE TRY LINE HERE IS THE 
SHOVE THIS IS LAWSON HE HAS GOT A 
FIFTH TRY THEY ARE DISPUTING IT WE ARE GOING 
TO HAVE A WORD WITH HUGHES OUR 
TELEVISION OFFICIAL YOU WILL ALL 
HAVE YOUR VIEW MY INITIAL INSTINCT 
WAS IT WAS TRY AS HE ROLLED OVER 
IT THEY MANAGED TO LEVER HIM UP 
RATHER LIKE A JUDO PLAYER DOES HE 
GET THE BALL DOWN OH HE DOES THE 
TRY WILL GO TO RORY LAWSON WHAT DID WE DO IN THE DAY'S WITHOUT 
TELEVISION MACHO FISHLS ALL PART 
OF THE DRA OFFICIALS ALL PART OF 
THE DRAMA OF RUGBY IN THE TWENTY FIRST 
CENTURY IT'S THIRTY NINE TO THREE IT'S BECOMING 
AN EMBARRASSMENT FOR SARACENS 
CAIRNS WITH THE THROW TAKEN IN BY 
SKIRVING ONCE AGAIN TOM RYDERER 
WHO IS BACK ON THIS IS DAVID 
SEYMOUR WHO CAN REALLY MOTOR PART 
OF THE SEVENS SET UP HE WAS 
BURSTING THROUGH GLOUCESTER'S 
DEFENCE THERE THIS IS MUCH BETTER 
FOR SARACENS WILL HE SCORE THEY 
DESERVE THAT ALAN POWELL IT WON'T 
EFFECT THE UTCOME OF THE MATCH 
BUT JUST FOR PURE TENACITY AND THE 
REFUSAL TO LIE DOWN NO ONE WILL 
BEBRIDGE SARACENS THAT SCORE IT IT 
GOES TO ADAM POWELL THIS IS WHERE IT STEMMED FROM THE 
BREAK FROM DAVID SEYMOUR A GREAT 
PLAYER AT HIS BEST AND THE 
CONVERSION SLOTTED BY GORDON ROSS HE IS DOWN IS HE DOWN IT'S OPEN PLAY THERE WAS NO BALL GO BACK REDS GO BACK THIS IS JOHNSTON HE HAS CERTAINLY 
MADE AN IMPACT SINCE HE BROUGHT HIS 
SIZABLE FRAME ON TO THE PITCH IN 
THE SECOND HALF CAN I SEE WHY PEOPLE ARE GETTING SO 
EXCITED ABOUT PAL IN WATFORD A 
REAL PROSPECT CAIRNS BACK TO 
RALUNI AGAIN THE MATCH IS STARTING 
TO FIRE UP AGAIN AFTER STODGEY 
PERIOD AGAIN THE GAME IS BEING 
PLAYED LIKE ONE OF SEVENS IN THE 
SUNSHINE GLOUCESTER'S DEFENCE JUST 
NEEDS TO WAKE UP A LITTLE BIT IT'S 
NOT GOING TO EFFECT THE GOOD WORK 
THEY HAVE DONE BUT THE COACHES 
WILL BE FURIOUS IF THEY CONCEDE 
MORE TRIES THEY ARE LOOKING LIKE 
DOING JUST THAT RALUNI TO POWELL HE HAS BEEN AT 
THE CENTRE OF ALL THINGS GOOD FROM 
A SARACENS PERSPECTIVE IN THE LAST 
FEW MINUTES RALUNI THAT IS THE 
TRY LINE IT'S BEEN REAL SPIRITED 
RESPONSE FROM SARACENS THEY WERE 
AT THE BOTTOM OF DEEP DEEP HOLE 
ROSS TRYING TO DO A RYAN LAMB EYE 
KERS OF SPACE AND BENN SKIRVING 
WILL SCORE THERE IS NO QUESTIONING 
THE CHARACTER OF THIS TEAM IT'S 
WHY THEY HAVE DONE SO WELL THIS 
SEASON LONG TRIP DOWN TO 
GLOUCESTER BUT AT LEAST IT'S 
ENDING WITH THEIR SIDE SCORING SOME 
TRIES BENN SKIRVING WITH THE 
SECOND I THINK NISHLY IT WAS 
RATUVAH THAT HAS GLOUCESTER'S 
ALARM SYSTEM RINGING AND THE 
DEFENCE WAS FINALLY PUN TURED BY 
THAT ACCURATE KICK FROM ROS INTO 
THE SPACE FOR SKIRVING THE HARD 
WORK WAS CATCHING IT STAY THERE TINDALL INTO SPACE THAT WAS OCCUPIED BY ARE ATUVAH SCARBOROUGH UP TO THE SAMOAN WINGER 
IS 
ANOTHER BIG WINGER LESLEY VAINKOLO 
NO ONE SCORED MORE TRIES IN THE 
PREMIERSHIP THAN THAT MAN HE HAS 
ADDED ANOTHER TODAY INTO THE FINAL MINUTE INTO TIME ADDED ON IS THERE TO BE LAST 
MOMENT OF ADVENTURE ONE LAST 
MOMENT OF GREAT AMBITION FROM 
GLOUCESTER A. R. PERHAPS FROM 
SARACENS NO DAN SCARBOROUGH 
SHEPERED INTO TOUCH BY TINDALL A 
TIMELY WIN FOR GLOUCESTER THEIR 
FIRST OF THE PREMIERSHIP FOR OVER 
MONTH THEIR PLACE IN THE PLAY OFFS 
IS ALL BUT SECURED FOR SARACENS A 
WEEK ON FROM THEIR MOST IMPORTANT 
WIN OF THE SEASON THEIR HEAVIEST 
DEFEAT OF THE SEASON THEY KNOW 
THEIR ONLY HOPE OF SHINEY 
SILVERWARE AT THE END OF IT WILL 
COME IN EUROPE EIGHT TRIES GREAT 
ENTERTAINMENT GLOUCESTER HAVE WON 
IT BY THIRTY NINE TO FIFTY MAN OF THE MATCH 
PERFORMANCE DISPLAY BY GLOUCESTER 
WAS THERE FEELING THEY HAD 
SOMETHING TO PROVE 
YES I THINK 
SARACENS HAVE COME OFF A FEW WINS 
AND WE HAVE COME OFF DISAPPOINTING 
LOSSES WE WANTED TO COME OUT THERE 
SPECIALLY FOR THE FANS THEY HAVE 
BEEN SUPPORTING US THIS IS GREAT 
FOR THE CLUB AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN 
SET OUR SEASON IN GOOD STEAD 
I AM 
PLEASED THAT TWO WEEKS WE HAVE 
PLAYED VERY WELL WE HAD A TO 
SUFFER THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF AN 
EXIT FROM THE HEINEKEN CUP WE WE DECIDED TO COME HERE AND MAKE THEM 
PLAY WE TRIED TO PLAY ON THE FRONT 
FOOT AND WE WERE SUCCESSFUL WITH IT 
TODAY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN WE HAD A 
CHANCE OF SCORING EARLY IN THE 
PIECE AND SHOULD HAVE SCORED VERY 
POOR DECISION BY THE PLAYER 
INVOLVED AND PROBABLY A CHANCE 
LATE IN THE HALF WHAT ANNOYS ME IS 
WE CAME HERE TODAY NOT TO CONCEDE 
THE SOFT TRIES TO GLOUCESTER YOU 
CAN SEE I WON'T SAY SOFT IN THE 
SENSE THEY ARE CLINICAL WHEN YOU 
GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY ON 
TURNOVERS THE FIRST TRY WAS A TURN 
OVER TRY FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW 
IT'S NONSENSICAL SOME OF THE 
THINGS WE DO TODAY WE COME HERE 
AND IT'S LIKE WE TAKE OUR HEAD OFF 
AND PUT ON A PUMPKIN WE DON'T PLAY 
WITH SENSE WE CAME HERE TO PLAY 
WELL BUT DIDN'T WE WENT OUT THERE 
AND PLAYED IN A LOOSE FASHION 
WHICH SUITS GLOUCESTER AND WE GOT 
OUR JUST DESSERTS L. AM HAPPY WITH 
THE WAY I PLAYED THE PACK WAS AWE 
SOME IF WE LOOK OVER THE GAME PLAN 
IT'S FANTASTIC IF I CAN GET STUFF 
OFF THE BACK OF THAT I AM HAPPY 
CITY FINALS ARE NOW GONE 
MATHEMATICALLY WE CAN'T DO IT L. 
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS WILL BE 
THIS WEEKEND BUT IRRESPECTIVE I 
DON'T THINK WE CAN DO IT WE HAVE 
TO AIM FOR TOP SIX AND 
QUALIFICATION FOR EUROPE WE WILL 
TRY AND GET TO EUROPE BY OTHER 
MEANS IN DOING WELL IN THE HEINEKEN
