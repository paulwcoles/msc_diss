THOU ART THYSELF THOUGH NOT A MONTAGUE WHAT'S IN A NAME 
THAT WHICH WE CALL A ROSE BY ANY OTHER WORD 
I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PLAY JULIET IN A SCENE FROM ROMEO AND JULIET 
I'VE CHECKED SOME VERSIONS OF THE PLAY TO SEE HOW THEY'VE PLAYED HER 
FRANKLY SHE'S MOSTLY PLAYED LIKE A COMPLETE DRIP NOT HOW I SEE HER I'LL GIVE YOU THIS FOR INSTANCE 
LOVE LORD I HUSBAND FRIEND 
THIS IS A CARTOON VERSION AND SHE'S ALL LA DI D. A. AND GHASTLY MAKE UP 
CHECK THIS SHE FAINTS LIKE SHE'S OUT OF SOME SORT OF FAIRY TALE 
IT'S NOT BELIEVABLE ANOTHER VERSION'S MUCH THE SAME 
HER MOTHER'S DROPPED A BOMBSHELL ABOUT HER HAVING TO MARRY PARIS AND SHE TAKES IT SO MEEK AND MILD 
EARLY NEXT THURSDAY MORN THE GALLANT YOUNG AND NOBLE GENTLEMAN THE COUNTY PARIS 
AT SAINT PETER'S CHURCH SHALL HAPPILY MAKE THEE THERE A JOYFUL BRIDE 
BY SAINT PETER'S CHURCH AND PETER TOO HE SHALL NOT MAKE ME THERE A JOYFUL BRIDE 
I WONDER AT THIS HASTE THAT I MUST WED ERE HE THAT SHOULD BE HUSBAND COMES TO WOO 
I PRAY YOU TELL MY LORD AND FATHER MADAM I WILL NOT MARRY YET 
I MEAN DO YOU BELIEVE HER I DON'T 
SHE JUST COMES ACROSS AS I DON'T KNOW TIMID 
SHE'S JUST MARRIED HER BOYFRIEND BEHIND HER PARENTS' BACK SMUGGLED HIM IN AND HAD SEX WITH HIM 
IT SEEMS TO ME THIS IS WHAT WE TRY IN REHEARSAL THAT YOU MUST FIND A WAY TO SHOW HER STRENGTH 
MARRY MY CHILD EARLY NEXT THURSDAY MORN 
THE GALLANT YOUNG AND NOBLE GENTLEMAN THE COUNTY PARIS 
AT SAINT PETER'S CHURCH SHALL HAPPY MAKE YOU THERE A JOYFUL BRIDE 
NOW BY SAINT PETER'S CHURCH AND PETER TOO 
HE SHALL NOT MAKE ME THERE A JOYFUL BRIDE 
MARCE WHY SO FEISTY AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT 
I'M TRYING TO MAKE HER THE WAY MOST FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLS WOULD TAKE IT 
IF THEIR MOTHER SAYS YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED ON THURSDAY IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE YEAH 
IT'S LIKE NO I'M NOT 
MARRY MY CHILD EARLY NEXT THURSDAY MORN 
THE GALLANT YOUNG AND NOBLE PRINCE THE COUNTY PARIS 
AT SAINT PETER'S CHURCH SHALL HAPPY MAKE THEE THERE A JOYFUL BRIDE 
NOW BY SAINT PETER'S CHURCH AND PETER TOO 
HE SHALL NOT MAKE ME THERE A JOYFUL BRIDE 
NO NO 
IT'S SO POWERFUL THIS VERSION IT'S LIKE JULIET'S IN TOTAL SHOCK 
SHE ROUNDS ON HER MOTHER LIKE SHE'S THE ENEMY SUDDENLY REALISING HER MOTHER NEVER REALLY LIKED HER MUCH 
AND THAT SHE'S PROBABLY JEALOUS I THINK THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES 
SHE'D PROBABLY LOVE TO BE YOUNG AGAIN AND MARRY SOMEONE LIKE PARIS 
FOR JULIET IT'S THE WORST POSSIBLE NEWS 
THEN HER FATHER COMES IN AND THE SPARKS REALLY START FLYING 
HANG THEE YOUNG BAGGAGE DISOBEDIENT WRETCH I TELL THEE WHAT

AN YOU BE MINE I'LL GIVE YOU TO MY FRIEND AN YOU BE NOT 
HANG BEG STARVE DIE IN THE STREETS FOR BY MY SOUL I'LL NE'ER ACKNOWLEDGE THEE 
I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY WRONG YOU HAVE TO SEE CAPULET EXPLODE AND JULIET'S FEAR 
CAPULET IS VERY CLOSE TO JULIET YOU FEEL IT IN HOW HE TALKS TO HER 
ALL THAT STUFF A BARK THY BODY IS SAILING IN THIS SALT FLOOD 
LIKE HE'S DESCRIBING THE CONTOURS OF HER BODY A BIT CREEPY REALLY 
FOR HER TO DISOBEY HIM TO SUDDENLY BE A WOMAN AND STAND UP TO HIM THAT WOULD BRING OUT HIS ANGER 
BUT CAN YOU JUST LOOK AT MY FINGERS ITCH 
YEAH WHAT DOES THAT MEAN O. K. MY FINGERS ITCH OBVIOUSLY MEANS 
YOU'LL GET A SMACK IF YOU DON'T DO AS I SAY A BEATING 
WHAT A BEATING NO BEN WOULD NEVER BEAT HIS OWN

DISOBEDIENT WRETCH 
I TELL THEE WHAT GET THEE TO CHURCH O' THURSDAY OR NEVER AFTER LOOK ME IN THE FACE 
SPEAK NOT 
REPLY NOT 
DO NOT ANSWER ME MY FINGERS ITCH 
THE BIGGEST TRAGEDY IS JULIET'S GOT NO ONE TO TALK TO 
ROMEO'S GOT HIS MATES MERCUTIO AND BENVOLIO FOR ALL THIS LADDISH CHAT 
BUT I FEEL JULIET'S REALLY LONELY THAT'S WHY HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER NURSE IS SO IMPORTANT 
SHE'S ALWAYS LOOKED TO HER FOR ADVICE LIKE A BEST FRIEND 
THAT'S WHY IT SEEMS SUCH A BETRAYAL WHEN SHE TELLS HER TO FORGET ROMEO 
ROMEO'S A DISHCLOUT TO HIM BESHREW MY HEART 
I'M SURE YOU ARE HAPPY IN THIS SECOND MATCH FOR IT EXCELS YOUR FIRST 
AND IF IT DID NOT YOUR FIRST IS DEAD OR TWERE AS GOOD HE WERE AS LIVING HERE AND YOU NO USE OF HIM 
SPEAKEST THOU FROM THY HEART 
FROM MY SOUL TOO OR BESHREW THEM BOTH 
SPEAKEST THOU FROM THY HEART AND FROM MY SOUL TOO 
ELSE BESHREW THEM BOTH 
THAT WAS NICE WHAT THOUGHTS ARE GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND NOW BECAUSE YOU'VE KNOWN HER FOR EVER 
BETRAYAL SHE PUT THE LADDER UP AGAINST THE HOUSE TO HELP HIM IN 
SHE LOOKED OUT THAT NIGHT WE WERE TOGETHER I DON'T SEE IT AS A BETRAYAL 
BUT YOU THINK IT'S A BETRAYAL COS I DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT YOU SAY 
OR THINK ABOUT YOUR POINT OF VIEW THAT'S THE TRAGEDY WHEN REALLY THE NURSE IS JUST PROTECTING JULIET 
IT'S A VERY TIMELESS STORY THIS 
I MEAN THESE DAYS CHILDREN DO GET A LOT MORE LICENCE I KNOW I DID 
I COULD STAND UP TO MY PARENTS MORE 
BUT HOW JULIET BEHAVES BELIEVING PASSIONATELY IN HER LOVE FOR ROMEO 
MAKES AS MUCH SENSE TODAY AS IT DID BACK THEN 
SO IN OUR VERSION WE'VE MADE IT MODERN 
AND SET IT IN THE CARIBBEAN WHICH IS HOT AND PASSIONATE AND SUITS THE PLAY'S SMOULDERING ATMOSPHERE 
OVER HERE THE NURSE WOULDN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE 
BUT IN THE CARIBBEAN A RICH FAMILY MIGHT HAVE A NURSE IN THE HOUSEHOLD 
AND JULIET SHE'S JUST THIS GUTSY TRAPPED YOUNG GIRL THAT'S JUST CROSSED THE BORDER INTO WOMANHOOD 
MADAM 
NURSE YOUR LADY MOTHER IS COMING TO YOUR CHAMBER THE DAY IS BROKE

I'LL SEND TO ONE IN MANTUA WHERE THAT SAME BANISHED RUNAGATE DOTH LIVE 
SHALL GIVE HIM SUCH AN UNACCUSTOMED DRAM THAT HE SHALL SOON KEEP TYBALT COMPANY 
AND THEN I HOPE THOU WILT BE SATISFIED 
INDEED I NEVER SHALL BE SATISFIED WITH ROMEO UNTIL I BEHOLD HIM 
DEAD IS MY POOR HEART SO FOR A KINSMAN VEXED 
MADAM IF YOU COULD FIND OUT BUT A MAN TO BEAR A POISON 
I WOULD TEMPER IT THAT ROMEO SHOULD UPON RECEIPT THEREOF SOON SLEEP IN QUIET 
FIND THOU THE MEANS AND I'LL FIND SUCH A MAN

GO IN AND TELL MY LADY I AM GONE HAVING DISPLEASED MY FATHER 
TO LAURENCE CELL TO MAKE CONFESSION AND TO BE ABSOLVED MARRY I WILL 
AND THIS IS WISELY DONE 
I'LL TO THE FRIAR TO KNOW HIS REMEDY 
IF ALL ELSE FAIL 
MYSELF HAVE POWER TO DIE 
AT THE END OF THE SCENE I'M FILLED WITH A SENSE OF DREAD FOR JULIET 
THE GAP BETWEEN HER AND HER NURSE IS SO WIDE IT'S LIKE SHE'S RUSHING INTO DARKNESS 
YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER TO MARRY PARIS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE 
I'M GOING TO PLAY MARK ANTONY IN A SCENE FROM JULIUS CAESAR 
IT'S THE MOMENT JUST AFTER CAESAR'S DEATH THE BODY LYING CARVED UP ON THE FLOOR RIOTS IN THE STREETS 
THE CONSPIRATORS STAND WITH BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS AND MARK ANTONY WALKS IN 
IT'S AN AMAZING MOMENT CAESAR WAS THE MAIN MAN ANTONY NUMBER TWO 
BUT CAESAR'S DEAD WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE ANTONY 
O. MIGHTY CAESAR DOST THOU LIE SO LOW 
NO ONE KNOWS THE AUDIENCE DOESN'T KNOW THE CONSPIRATORS DON'T KNOW 
ANTONY DOESN'T KNOW BUT HE JUST WALKS IN THERE AMONG THEM ANYWAY 
AND I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS MAN'S MIND 
I KNOW NOT GENTLEMEN WHAT YOU INTEND 
WHO ELSE MUST BE LET BLOOD WHO ELSE IS RANK IF I MYSELF 
THERE IS NO HOUR SO FIT AS CAESAR'S DEATH HOUR NOR NO INSTRUMENT OF HALF THAT WORTH 
AS THOSE YOUR SWORDS MADE RICH WITH THE MOST NOBLE BLOOD OF ALL THIS WORLD 
ONE THING THAT MAKES SHAKESPEARE SUCH A BUZZ FOR ME IS HOW IT CAN BE PLAYED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS 
I DON'T MEAN WHETHER YOU WEAR A TOGA OR NOT BUT HOW YOU PLAY IT 
LIKE MARK ANTONY YOU CAN EMPHASISE HOW HE'S NOBLE AND UPRIGHT 
OR HIS BRAVERY PUSHING HIS WAY FEARLESSLY THROUGH THE CONSPIRATORS 
OR HIS VULNERABILITY HOW HE'S AT THEIR MERCY LIKE ANY MINUTE THEY MIGHT SLICE HIM UP 
THE ACTOR MAKES THE CHOICE BUT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN HIM 
MARK ANTONY'S A PASSIONATE MAN HE MUST BE THINKING THESE GUYS ARE WILD THEY'VE CUT HIM TO SHREDS 
I THINK HE'D BE DEVASTATED 
FULL OF EMOTION 
MIGHTY CAESAR DOST THOU LIE SO LOW 
ARE ALL THY CONQUESTS GLORIES 
TRIUMPHS SPOILS SHRUNK TO THIS LITTLE MEASURE 
FARE THEE WELL 
I KNOW NOT GENTLEMEN WHAT YOU INTEND WHO ELSE MUST BE LET BLOOD WHO ELSE IS RANK 
IF I MYSELF THERE IS NO HOUR SO FIT AS CAESAR'S DEATH HOUR NOR NO INSTRUMENT OF HALF THAT WORTH 
AS THOSE YOUR SWORDS MADE RICH WITH THE MOST NOBLE BLOOD OF ALL THIS WORLD 
I DO BESEECH YE IF YE BEAR ME HARD NOW WHILST YOUR PURPLE HANDS DO REEK AND SMOKE FULFIL YOUR PLEASURE 
IN THIS SCENE ANTONY'S PLAYING FOR TIME SOUNDING THEM OUT 
IT'S LIKE BOOM CAESAR'S DEAD I'M UPSET YOU'VE SEEN ME UPSET I SUPPOSE YOU'RE GOING TO KILL ME 
OH YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KILL ME RIGHT AND HE'S THINKING THEN HE DOES THIS INCREDIBLE THING 
HE SHAKES THEM BY THE HAND ONE AFTER ANOTHER COVERED IN THE BLOOD OF HIS BEST FRIEND 
LET EACH MAN RENDER ME HIS BLOODY HAND FIRST MARCUS BRUTUS WILL I SHAKE WITH YOU 
RENDER ME HIS BLOODY HAND YES THEN GO TO HIM NOW BRUTUS 
RIGHT LET'S TAKE THAT MOMENT THERE YOU WERE BOTH GOING INTO IT TOGETHER 
LET'S IT'S OVER CAESAR'S BODY BOTH YOUR HANDS ARE COVERED IN BLOOD 
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS THIS TIME JUST TO SEE HOW DIFFERENT IT IS 
IF BRUTUS'S FIRST REACTION IS 
I'LL PUT CAESAR'S BLOOD ON HIM IF I TOUCH HIM 
LET EACH MAN RENDER ME HIS BLOODY HAND 
FIRST MARCUS BRUTUS WILL I SHAKE WITH YOU 
GOOD NOW LET'S LOOK AT IT DIFFERENTLY 
GIVE ME THAT LINE LET EACH MAN RENDER ME HIS BLOODY HAND CHALLENGE HIM 
FIRST MARCUS BRUTUS WILL I SHAKE WITH YOU 
NOW BRUTUS 
I RECKON IT'S ONLY AFTER THE HANDSHAKE ANTONY REALLY CLICKS' 
HE THINKS I CAN'T CRY ABOUT THIS I'VE GOT TO GET THESE GUYS 
THAT'S WHEN HE ASKS TO SPEAK AT CAESAR'S FUNERAL 
THAT I MAY PRODUCE HIS BODY TO THE MARKET PLACE 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING PLANNED THEY ALL ACT FOR THE MOMENT THAT'S WHY BRUTUS AGREES 
HE DOESN'T SEE THE DANGER THAT ANTONY COULD STIR UP THE MOB ONLY COLD CASSIUS SEES WHAT'S GOING ON 
YOU KNOW NOT WHAT YOU DO DO NOT CONSENT MARK ANTONY SPEAK IN HIS FUNERAL 
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE PEOPLE MAY BE MOVED BY THAT WHICH HE WILL UTTER THAT'S ALL I SEEK AND AM MOREOVER 
SUITOR THAT I MAY PRODUCE HIS BODY TO THE MARKET PLACE YOU SHALL MARK ANTONY 
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING THERE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CASSIUS I'M WORRIED 
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE SAID YOU SHALL I'M THINKING YOU'RE MAD 
YOU SAW HIM WHEN HE SAW THE BODY 
EVEN I WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE STABBING THOUGHT HE WAS SAYING IT 
AND YOU TELL HIM TO SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE YOU'RE MAD 
RIGHT BRUTUS WHAT HAVE YOU JUST SAID WHAT'S HAPPENING 
IT'S FINE HE JUST MAKES A SIMPLE REQUEST AND HAVING BEEN HIS MATE 
I SAY YES OF COURSE BUT I SAY IT OUT LOUD BEFORE ALL THESE PEOPLE 
I CAN'T GO BACK ON WHAT I'VE SAID AND I FEEL AS SOON AS I'VE SAID IT 
AND CASSIUS SAYS CAN I HAVE A WORD I GO OH I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT 
WHEN I THINK OF ROME AND THE ROMAN EMPIRE I DON'T ALWAYS THINK NOBLE HONOURABLE 
I THINK THAT'S JUST SHOW UNDERNEATH YOU'LL FIND CYNICISM CRUELTY CORRUPTION 
IN POLITICS TODAY SADLY NOTHING'S CHANGED IT'S ALL AMBITION WHO'S IN POWER WHO'S OUT 
AND IF YOU'RE OUT AND WANT IN YOU MIGHT HAVE TO LIE CHEAT EVEN KILL 
BUT ANTONY HASN'T HAD TO THINK LIKE THAT HE WAS CAESAR'S FAVOURITE 
HE'S COOL HE'S HAPPY HE GETS THE GIRLS THE FUN 
WITHOUT CAESAR ANTONY HAS TO START THINKING LIKE A POLITICAL ANIMAL 
THAT'S WHAT THIS SCENE'S ABOUT THIS PASSIONATE MAN MUST NOW THINK ON HIS FEET STAY ALERT KEEP AHEAD 
AND WHEN THEY LEAVE HIM ALONE WITH THE BODY ALL THAT BOTTLED UP EMOTION JUST EXPLODES 
O. PARDON ME THOU BLEEDING PIECE OF EARTH THAT I AM MEEK AND GENTLE WITH THESE BUTCHERS 
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING HE SAYS O. O. GOOD WORD WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT O. 
O. EXCUSE ME I'M SORRY FORGIVE ME 
WHICH HE COULDN'T EXPRESS WHILE THEY WERE THERE HE'D BEEN PLAY ACTING AND CALCULATED ABOUT SHOWING IT 
NOW THERE'S THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHOWING HIS GRIEF IN ORDER IF YOU LIKE TO PUT THEM ON THE SPOT YEAH 
WHICH IS A BIT OF A PERFORMANCE AND NOW THEY'VE GONE HE CAN SAY IT 
O. K. RIGHT YEAH 
O. K. SO THEY'VE GONE OFF YOU GO 
O. 
PARDON ME THOU BLEEDING PIECE OF EARTH 
THAT I AM MEEK AND GENTLE WITH THESE BUTCHERS 
IT'S TIME TO GET READY WE'RE SETTING THE SCENE IN THE PRESENT DAY IN A T. V. STUDIO 
IT'S LIKE TELEVISION'S A VEHICLE FOR POWER 
CAESAR WOULD USE T. V. TO EXERCISE THAT POWER HE'D HAVE HIS OWN SHOW 
SO MY MARK ANTONY HE'D KNOW ABOUT IMAGE HOW TO PRESENT HIMSELF SMOOTH ELEGANT DESIGNER LABELS 
O. K. ALL SET 
I COULD BE WELL MOVED IF I WERE AS YOU 
IF I COULD PRAY TO MOVE PRAYERS WOULD MOVE ME BUT I AM CONSTANT AS THE NORTHERN STAR 
OF WHOSE TRUE FIXT AND RESTING QUALITY THERE IS NO FELLOW IN THE FIRMAMENT 
WILL HE LIFT UP OLYMPUS 
SPEAK HANDS FOR ME 
ET TU BRUTE 
THEN FALL CAESAR 
LIBERTY FREEDOM TYRANNY IS DEAD 
RUN HENCE PROCLAIM CRY IT ABOUT THE STREETS 
LIBERTY FREEDOM AND ENFRANCHISEMENT 
PEOPLE AND SENATORS BE NOT AFFRIGHTED FLY NOT STAND STILL MEN WIVES CHILDREN STARE 
CRY OUT AND RUN AS IT WERE DOOMSDAY 
STOOP ROMANS 
STOOP 
AND LET US BATHE OUR HANDS IN CAESAR'S BLOOD 
UP TO THE ELBOWS AND BESMEAR OUR SWORDS 
THEN WALK WE FORTH EVEN TO THE MARKET PLACE AND WAVING OUR RED WEAPONS O'ER OUR HEADS 
LET'S ALL CRY PEACE FREEDOM AND LIBERTY STOOP THEN 
AND WASH 
HOW MANY AGES HENCE WILL THIS OUR LOFTY SCENE BE ACTED OVER 
IN STATES UNBORN AND ACCENTS YET UNKNOWN 
WHAT SHALL WE FORTH AY EVERY MAN AWAY 
BRUTUS SHALL LEAD AND WE WILL GRACE HIS HEELS WITH THE MOST BOLDEST AND BEST HEARTS OF ROME 
BUT HERE COMES ANTONY WELCOME MARK ANTONY 
O. MIGHTY CAESAR DOST THOU LIE SO LOW 
ARE ALL THY CONQUESTS GLORIES 
TRIUMPHS SPOILS SHRUNK TO THIS LITTLE MEASURE 
FARE THEE WELL 
I KNOW NOT GENTLEMEN WHAT YOU INTEND 
WHO ELSE MUST BE LET BLOOD WHO ELSE IS RANK 
I BESEECH YE IF YOU BEAR ME HARD 
NOW WHILST YOUR PURPLED HANDS DO REEK AND SMOKE FULFIL YOUR PLEASURE 
LIVE A THOUSAND YEARS I SHALL NOT FIND MYSELF SO APT TO DIE NO PLACE WILL PLEASE ME SO 
NO MEAN OF DEATH AS HERE BY CAESAR AND BY YOU CUT OFF THE CHOICE AND MASTER SPIRITS OF THIS AGE 
ANTONY BEG NOT YOUR DEATH OF US 
THOUGH NOW WE MUST APPEAR BLOODY AND CRUEL AS BY OUR HANDS AND THIS OUR PRESENT ACT YOU SEE WE DO 
YET SEE YOU BUT OUR HANDS AND THIS THE BLEEDING BUSINESS THEY HAVE DONE OUR HEARTS YOU SEE NOT 
THEY ARE PITIFUL AND PITY TO THE GENERAL WRONG OF ROME 
AS FIRE DRIVES OUT FIRE SO PITY PITY HATH DONE THIS DEED ON CAESAR 
FOR YOUR PART TO YOU OUR SWORDS HAVE LEADEN POINTS MARK ANTONY 
OUR ARMS NO STRENGTH OF MALICE AND OUR HEARTS OF BROTHERS' TEMPER DO RECEIVE YOU IN WITH ALL KIND LOVE 
GOOD THOUGHTS AND REVERENCE YOUR VOICE WILL BE AS STRONG AS ANY MAN'S IN THE DISPOSING OF NEW DIGNITIES 
ONLY BE PATIENT TILL WE HAVE APPEASED THE MULTITUDE BESIDE THEMSELVES WITH FEAR 
THEN WILL WE DELIVER YOU THE CAUSE WHY I THAT DID LOVE CAESAR WHEN I STRUCK HIM HAVE THUS PROCEEDED 
I DOUBT NOT OF YOUR WISDOM LET EACH MAN RENDER ME HIS BLOODY HAND 
NOW BRUTUS 
CASCA YOURS 
NOW YOURS METELLUS 
NEXT CAIUS CASSIUS DO I TAKE YOUR HAND 
THOUGH LAST NOT LEAST IN LOVE YOURS GOOD POPILIUS 
GENTLEMEN ALL ALAS WHAT SHALL I SAY 
MY CREDIT NOW STANDS ON SUCH SLIPPERY GROUND 
THAT ONE OF TWO BAD WAYS YOU MUST CONCEIT ME EITHER A COWARD OR A FLATTERER 
THAT I DID LOVE THEE CAESAR O. TIS TRUE 
IF THEN THY SPIRIT LOOK UPON US NOW SHALL IT NOT GRIEVE THEE DEARER THAN THY DEATH 
TO SEE THY ANTONY MAKING HIS PEACE SHAKING THE BLOODY FINGERS OF THY FOES 
MOST NOBLE IN THE PRESENCE OF THY CORSE 
HAD I AS MANY EYES AS THOU HAST WOUNDS WEEPING AS FAST AS THEY STREAM FORTH THY BLOOD 
IT WOULD BECOME ME BETTER THAN TO CLOSE IN TERMS OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THINE ENEMIES 
MARK ANTONY PARDON ME CAIUS CASSIUS THE ENEMIES OF CAESAR SHALL SAY THIS 
THEN IN A FRIEND IT IS COLD MODESTY I BLAME YOU NOT FOR PRAISING CAESAR SO 
WILL YOU BE PRICKT IN NUMBER OF OUR FRIENDS OR SHALL WE ON AND NOT DEPEND ON YOU 
THEREFORE I TOOK YOUR HANDS BUT WAS INDEED SWAYED FROM THE POINT 
BY LOOKING DOWN ON CAESAR FRIENDS AM I WITH YOU ALL 
AND LOVE YOU ALL UPON THIS HOPE THAT YOU SHALL GIVE ME REASONS WHY AND WHEREIN CAESAR WAS DANGEROUS 
OUR REASONS ARE SO FULL OF GOOD REGARD THAT WERE YOU THE SON OF CAESAR YOU SHOULD BE SATISFIED 
THAT'S ALL I SEEK AND AM MOREOVER SUITOR THAT I MAY PRODUCE HIS BODY TO THE MARKET PLACE 
AND IN THE PULPIT AS BECOMES A FRIEND SPEAK IN THE ORDER OF HIS FUNERAL YOU SHALL MARK ANTONY 
BRUTUS A WORD WITH YOU 
YOU KNOW NOT WHAT YOU DO DO NOT CONSENT THAT ANTONY SPEAK IN HIS FUNERAL 
KNOW YOU HOW MUCH THE PEOPLE MAY BE MOVED BY THAT WHICH HE WILL UTTER BY YOUR PARDON 
I WILL MYSELF INTO THE PULPIT FIRST AND SHOW THE REASON OF OUR CAESAR'S DEATH 
AND WHAT ANTONY SHALL SPEAK I WILL PROTEST HE SPEAKS BY LEAVE AND BY PERMISSION 
AND THAT WE ARE CONTENTED CAESAR SHALL HAVE ALL TRUE RITES AND LAWFUL CEREMONIES 
IT WILL ADVANTAGE MORE THAN DO US WRONGLY I KNOW NOT WHAT MAY FALL I LIKE IT NOT 
MARK ANTONY HERE TAKE YOU CAESAR'S BODY 
YOU SHALL NOT IN YOUR FUNERAL SPEECH BLAME US 
BUT SPEAK ALL GOOD YOU CAN DEVISE OF CAESAR 
AND SAY YOU DO IT BY OUR PERMISSION ELSE SHALL YOU NOT HAVE ANY HAND AT ALL ABOUT HIS FUNERAL 
AND YOU SHALL SPEAK IN THE SAME PULPIT WHERETO I AM GOING AFTER MY SPEECH IS ENDED 
BE IT SO I DO DESIRE NO MORE PREPARE THE BODY THEN AND FOLLOW US 
O. 
PARDON ME THOU BLEEDING PIECE OF EARTH THAT I AM MEEK AND GENTLE WITH THESE BUTCHERS 
THOU ART THE RUINS OF THE NOBLEST MAN THAT EVER LIVED IN THE TIDE OF TIMES 
WOE TO THE HAND THAT SHED THIS COSTLY BLOOD 
OVER THY WOUNDS NOW I PROPHESY 
WHICH LIKE DUMB MOUTHS DO OPE THEIR RUBY LIPS TO BEG THE VOICE AND UTTERANCE OF MY TONGUE 
A CURSE SHALL LIGHT UPON THE LIMBS OF MEN 
DOMESTIC FURY AND FIERCE CIVIL STRIFE SHALL CUMBER ALL THE PARTS OF ITALY 
BLOOD AND DESTRUCTION SHALL BE SO IN USE AND DREADFUL OBJECTS SO FAMILIAR 
THAT MOTHERS SHALL BUT SMILE WHEN THEY BEHOLD THEIR INFANTS QUARTERED WITH THE HAND OF WAR 
ALL PITY CHOKED WITH CUSTOM OF FELL DEEDS AND CAESAR'S SPIRIT RANGING FOR REVENGE 
WITH ATE BY HIS SIDE COME HOT FROM HELL 
SHALL IN THESE CONFINES WITH A MONARCH'S VOICE CRY HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR 
THAT THIS FOUL DEED SHALL SMELL ABOVE THE EARTH WITH CARRION MEN GROANING FOR BURIAL 
I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF BRUTUS HAD LISTENED TO CASSIUS 
AND STOPPED ANTONY TALKING TO THE MOB WHAT WOULD ANTONY HAVE DONE THEN 
IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE BUT YOUR DAD IS FORCING YOU TO MARRY SOMEONE ELSE 
SO YOU RUN AWAY WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND AT NIGHT INTO A MIDSUMMER'S WOOD 
YOU BOTH FALL ASLEEP UNDER A TREE BUT WHEN YOU WAKE UP HE'S GONE 
WHEN YOU FIND HIM HE DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW YOU AND HE SAYS HE'S FALLEN IN LOVE WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND 
WELL THAT'S HERMIA'S STORY IN A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM 
ONLY IT DOESN'T REALLY FEEL MUCH LIKE A DREAM MORE LIKE SOME WEIRD CONFUSING NIGHTMARE 
I SAY I LOVE THEE MORE THAN HE CAN DO IF THOU SAY SO WITHDRAW AND PROVE IT TOO 
AWAY YOU ETHIOP HANG OFF THOU CAT BURR VILE THING LET LOOSE OR I'LL SHAKE THEE FROM ME LIKE A SERPENT 
THY LOVE OUT TAWNY TARTAR OUT 
O. LOATHED MEDICINE HATED POTION 
I'M GOING TO PLAY HERMIA IN A NEW VERSION OF THIS SCENE 
IT'S FUNNY COMPLEX ROMANTIC AND MAGICAL BUT CAN ALSO BE CONFUSING 
ESPECIALLY THIS SCENE WITH THE LOVERS FALLING IN AND OUT OF LOVE 
SO IN REHEARSAL WE FIRST GET A FIX ON THE PLOT 
WE HAVE FOUR LOVERS HERMIA LOVES LYSANDER LYSANDER LOVES HERMIA 
BUT DEMETRIUS ALSO LOVES HERMIA HER FATHER WANTS HER TO MARRY HIM 
MEANWHILE HELENA HERMIA'S BEST FRIEND LOVES DEMETRIUS THAT'S THE SITUATION AT THE START OF THE PLAY 
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY AT FIRST HELENA IS CONTENT TO CHASE AFTER DEMETRIUS 
AND THOUGH DEMETRIUS DOESN'T LIKE HER HANGING ON HIS HEELS HE'S HAPPY CHASING AFTER HERMIA 
OFTEN IN REAL LIFE THE CHASE IS THE MOST EXCITING 
THEN IN THE WOOD THIS WORLD IS TURNED ON ITS HEAD 
DEMETRIUS AND LYSANDER FALL IN LOVE WITH HELENA 
SUDDENLY HERMIA FINDS HERSELF REJECTED 
AND LONG SUFFERING HELENA THINKS THE OTHER THREE ARE JUST WINDING HER UP IN THIS UNPLEASANT WAY 
NOW I PERCEIVE THEY HAVE CONJOIN'D ALL THREE TO FASHION THIS FALSE SPORT IN SPITE OF ME 
INJURIOUS HERMIA MOST UNGRATEFUL MAID HAVE YOU CONSPIRED 
HAVE YOU WITH THESE CONTRIVED TO BAIT ME WITH THIS FOUL DERISION 
IT IS NOT FRIENDLY TIS NOT MAIDENLY OUR SEX AS WELL AS I MAY CHIDE YOU FOR IT 
THOUGH I ALONE DO FEEL THE INJURY I AM AMAZED AT YOUR PASSIONATE WORDS 
I SCORN YOU NOT IT SEEMS THAT YOU SCORN ME HAVE YOU NOT SET LYSANDER 
TO FOLLOW ME AND PRAISE MY FACE AND EYES AND MADE YOUR OTHER LOVE 
DEMETRIUS WHO EVEN BUT NOW DID SPURN ME WITH HIS FOOT 
TO CALL ME GODDESS NYMPH DIVINE AND RARE I UNDERSTAND NOT 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HERMIA AND HELENA IS CENTRAL TO THIS SCENE 
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THIS RELATIONSHIP CREDIBLE THEY WERE BEST FRIENDS AT SCHOOL SHARING EVERYTHING 
LIKE TO A DOUBLE CHERRY AS HELENA SAYS BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO SHOW THEIR DIFFERENCES 
HELENA'S BRIGHT AND THINKS THINGS THROUGH 
BUT ALSO CAUTIOUS AND UNCONFIDENT ESPECIALLY WITH BOYS 
BUT HERMIA IS QUITE DIFFERENT IMPETUOUS FIERY TOTALLY CONFIDENT 
I THINK THAT'S WHY IN THIS SCENE HERMIA'S SO CONFUSED NEVER BEFORE HAS SHE HAD TO HANDLE REJECTION 
BUT WHY UNKINDLY DIDST THOU LEAVE ME SO WHY SHOULD HE STAY WHOM LOVE DOTH PRESS TO GO 
WHAT LOVE COULD PRESS LYSANDER FROM MY SIDE LYSANDER'S LOVE THAT WOULD NOT LET HIM BIDE 
YOU SPEAK NOT AS YOU THINK IT CANNOT BE 
SOME PRODUCTIONS TRY TO BRING OUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HELENA AND HERMIA BY HOW THEY LOOK 
HERMIA'S PRETTY WHILE HELENA'S TALL AND FRUMPY OR WITH MESSED HAIR AND GLASSES TO MAKE HER LOOK STUDIOUS 
THAT APPROACH WORKS IN AN OBVIOUS WAY THE BOYS FALLING FOR THE PLAIN GIRL AND REJECTING THE PRETTY ONE 
BUT SIMONE OUR HELENA IS BEAUTIFUL THAT'S MORE INTERESTING 
LIKE QUESTIONING THE WHOLE NATURE OF HUMAN ATTRACTIVENESS 
WHY IS SOMEONE ATTRACTED TO ONE PERSON NOT ANOTHER 
ALTHOUGH THE PLAY'S A COMEDY THIS SCENE TOUCHES ON SERIOUS STUFF REALLY TRUTHFUL 
HOW PEOPLE FALL IN AND OUT OF LOVE THE FINE LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE 
WHAT SHOULD I HURT HER STRIKE HER KILL HER DEAD NO 
ALTHOUGH I HATE HER I'LL NOT HARM HER SO WHAT CAN YOU DO ME GREATER HARM THAN HATE HATE ME 
WHEREFORE O. ME WHAT NEWS MY LOVE AM NOT I HERMIA ARE YOU NOT LYSANDER 
I AM AS FAIR NOW AS I WAS EREWHILE SINCE NIGHT YOU LOVED ME YET SINCE NIGHT YOU LEFT ME 
WHY THEN YOU LEFT ME O. THE GODS FORBID IN EARNEST SHALL I SAY 
AY BY MY LIFE BE CERTAIN NOTHING TRUER TIS NO JEST THAT I DO HATE THEE AND LOVE HELENA 
THIS IS REALLY PAINFUL THIS IS WHEN IT FINALLY SINKS IN 
LITTLE MISS POPULARITY NOW FEELS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE UNWANTED LIKE HELENA HER WORLD JUST FALLS APART 
BE OUT OF HOPE OF QUESTION OF DOUBT BE CERTAIN NOTHING TRUER TIS NO JEST 
THAT I DO HATE THEE AND LOVE HELENA 
SO SHE TURNS ON HELENA AND BLAMES HER FOR LYSANDER'S CRUELTY 
YOU JUGGLER 
YOU CANKER BLOSSOM YOU THIEF OF LOVE 
FINE I'FAITH HAVE YOU NO MODESTY NO MAIDEN SHAME NO TOUCH OF BASHFULNESS 
THE REST OF THE SCENE'S GREAT FUN REALLY PHYSICAL COMEDY 
O. EXCELLENT 
INSULTS FLYING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS 
HERMIA GOES FOR THE THROAT AND THE BOYS HAVE TO HOLD HER BACK 
ON ONE LEVEL IT'S A SAD PICTURE OF HOW A CLOSE FRIENDSHIP CAN COLLAPSE 
ON ANOTHER IT'S JUST FUNNY THE LANGUAGE YOU MINIMUS OF HIND'RING KNOT GRASS MADE 
AND THE WONDERFUL WAY YOU CAN PLAY OFF BETWEEN THE ACTRESSES' HEIGHTS 
FIE YOU COUNTERFEIT YOU PUPPET YOU PUPPET WHY SO AY 
THAT WAY GOES THE GAME NOW I PERCEIVE 
THAT SHE HATH MADE COMPARE BETWEEN OUR STATURES 
AND WITH HER PERSONAGE HER TALL PERSONAGE HER HEIGHT FORSOOTH SHE HATH PREVAILED WITH HIM 
HOW LOW AM I THOU PAINTED MAYPOLE SPEAK 
I AM NOT YET SO LOW BUT THAT MY NAILS CAN REACH UNTO THINE EYES 
YOU PERHAPS MAY THINK BECAUSE SHE IS SOMETHING LOWER THAN MYSELF 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS SCENE KNOWING HOW SERIOUSLY TO TAKE IT 
DO YOU JUST GO WITH THE COMEDY OR WORK TO ROOT THE COMEDY IN SOMETHING MORE TRUTHFUL THAT'S WHAT WE TRY 
TO SHOW THAT THE LOVERS' BUSINESS ISN'T JUST FARCE BUT HONEST AND CONTEMPORARY 
HAPPENING AS MUCH NOW AS IN SHAKESPEARE'S TIME SO WE'VE DRESSED IN MODERN COSTUME 
AND INSTEAD OF ESCAPING TO A FOREST 
WE'VE IMAGINED THE LOVERS RUNNING AWAY TO THE URBAN EQUIVALENT AN OLD INDUSTRIAL BUILDING 
THE MIDSUMMER FOREST FOR SHAKESPEARE WAS A PLACE AT THE SAME TIME MYSTERIOUS AND NIGHTMARISH 
OUR SETTING HAS THE SAME FEEL WE'VE JUST TRANSPOSED THE NATURAL FOREST FOR THE MAN MADE WORLD OF THE CITY 
THOU ART NOT BY MINE EYE LYSANDER FOUND MY EAR I THANK IT BROUGHT ME TO THY SOUND 
BUT WHY UNKINDLY DIDST THOU LEAVE ME SO WHY SHOULD HE STAY WHOM LOVE DOTH PRESS TO GO 
WHAT LOVE COULD PRESS LYSANDER FROM MY SIDE LYSANDER'S LOVE THAT WOULD NOT LET HIM BIDE 
FAIR HELENA WHO MORE ENGILDS THE NIGHT THAN ALL YON FIERY O.'S AND EYES OF LIGHT 
WHY SEEK'ST THOU ME COULD NOT THIS MAKE THEE KNOW THE HATE I BEAR THEE MADE ME LEAVE THEE SO 
YOU SPEAK NOT AS YOU THINK IT CANNOT BE SHE IS ONE OF THIS CONFEDERACY 
NOW I PERCEIVE THEY HAVE CONJOINED ALL THREE TO FASHION THIS FALSE SPORT IN SPITE OF ME 
INJURIOUS HERMIA MOST UNGRATEFUL MAID HAVE YOU CONSPIRED HAVE YOU WITH THESE CONTRIVED 
TO BAIT ME WITH THIS FOUL DERISION 
IS ALL THE COUNSEL THAT WE TWO HAVE SHARED THE SISTERS' VOWS 
HOURS THAT WE HAVE SPENT WHEN WE HAVE CHID THE HASTY FOOTED TIME FOR PARTING US 
O. AND IS ALL FORGOT 
ALL SCHOOLDAY'S FRIENDSHIP CHILDHOOD INNOCENCE 
WE HERMIA LIKE TWO ARTIFICIAL GODS HAVE WITH OUR NEEDLES CREATED BOTH ONE FLOWER 
BOTH ON ONE SAMPLER SITTING ON ONE CUSHION BOTH WARBLING OF ONE SONG BOTH IN ONE KEY AS IF OUR HANDS 
OUR SIDES VOICES AND MINDS HAD BEEN INCORPORATE SO WE GREW TOGETHER 
LIKE TO A DOUBLE CHERRY SEEMING PARTED BUT YET AN UNION IN PARTITION 
TWO LOVELY BERRIES MOULDED ON ONE STEM 
AND WILL YOU REND OUR ANCIENT LOVE ASUNDER TO JOIN WITH 
IN SCORNING YOUR POOR FRIEND IT IS NOT FRIENDLY 
TIS NOT MAIDENLY OUR SEX AS WELL AS I MAY CHIDE YOU FOR IT THOUGH I ALONE DO FEEL THE INJURY 
I AM AMAZED AT YOUR PASSIONATE WORDS I SCORN YOU NOT IT SEEMS THAT YOU SCORN ME 
HAVE YOU NOT SET LYSANDER AS IN SCORN 
TO FOLLOW ME AND PRAISE MY EYES AND FACE 
AND MADE YOUR OTHER LOVE DEMETRIUS WHO EVEN BUT NOW DID SPURN ME WITH HIS FOOT TO CALL ME GODDESS 
NYMPH DIVINE AND RARE 
PRECIOUS CELESTIAL 
WHEREFORE SPEAKS HE THIS TO HER HE HATES 
AND WHEREFORE DOTH LYSANDER DENY YOUR LOVE SO RICH WITHIN HIS SOUL AND TENDER ME FORSOOTH AFFECTION 
BUT BY YOUR SETTING ON BY YOUR CONSENT 
WHAT THOUGH I BE NOT SO IN GRACE AS YOU 
SO HUNG UPON WITH LOVE SO FORTUNATE 
BUT MISERABLE MOST TO LOVE UNLOVED 
THIS YOU SHOULD PITY RATHER THAN DESPISE I UNDERSTAND NOT WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS 
AY DO PERSEVER COUNTERFEIT SAD LOOKS MAKE MOUTHS UPON ME WHEN I TURN MY BACK 
WINK AT EACH OTHER HOLD THE SWEET JEST UP THIS SPORT WELL CARRIED 
SHALL BE CHRONICLED IF YOU HAVE ANY PITY GRACE OR MANNERS YOU WOULD NOT MAKE ME SUCH AN ARGUMENT 
FARE YE WELL TIS PARTLY MY OWN FAULT 
WHICH DEATH OR ABSENCE SOON SHALL REMEDY STAY GENTLE HELENA HEAR MY EXCUSE MY LOVE MY LIFE MY SOUL 
FAIR HELENA O. EXCELLENT SWEET DO NOT SCORN HER SO IF SHE CANNOT ENTREAT I CAN COMPEL 
THOU CANST COMPEL NO MORE THAN SHE ENTREAT THY THREATS HAVE NO MORE STRENGTH THAN HER WEAK PRAYERS 
I LOVE THEE BY MY LIFE I DO I SWEAR BY THAT WHICH I WILL LOSE FOR THEE TO PROVE HIM FALSE 
THAT SAYS I LOVE THEE NOT I SAY I LOVE THEE MORE THAN HE CAN DO IF THOU SAY SO WITHDRAW AND PROVE IT 
QUICK COME LYSANDER WHERETO TENDS ALL THIS AWAY YOU ETHIOP NO NO YOU SEEM TO BREAK LOOSE

THAT WAY GOES THE GAME 
NOW I PERCEIVE THAT SHE HATH MADE COMPARE BETWEEN OUR STATURES 
SHE HATH URGED HER HEIGHT AND WITH HER PERSONAGE HER TALL PERSONAGE 
HER HEIGHT FORSOOTH SHE HATH PREVAILED WITH HIM 
ARE YOU GROWN SO HIGH IN HIS ESTEEM BECAUSE I AM SO DWARFISH AND SO LOW 
HOW LOW AM I THOU PAINTED MAYPOLE SPEAK HOW LOW AM I 
I AM NOT YET SO LOW BUT THAT MY NAILS CAN REACH UNTO THINE EYES 
LET HER NOT HURT ME I HAVE NO GIFT AT ALL IN SHREWISHNESS I AM A RIGHT MAID FOR MY COWARDICE 
LET HER NOT HURT ME YOU MAY THINK BECAUSE SHE IS SOMETHING LOWER THAN MYSELF THAT I CAN MATCH HER 
LOWER HARK AGAIN GOOD HERMIA DO NOT BE SO BITTER WITH ME 
I EVERMORE DID LOVE YOU DID EVER KEEP YOUR COUNSELS NEVER WRONG'D YOU 
SAVE THAT IN LOVE UNTO DEMETRIUS I TOLD HIM OF YOUR STEALTH UNTO THIS WOOD 
HE FOLLOWED YOU FOR LOVE I FOLLOWED HIM BUT HE HATH CHID ME HENCE THREATENED ME 
TO STRIKE ME SPURN ME NAY TO KILL ME TOO 
NOW SO YOU WILL LET ME QUIET GO TO ATHENS WILL I BEAR MY FOLLY BACK AND FOLLOW YOU NO FURTHER

WHY GET YOU GONE 
WHO IS'T THAT HINDERS YOU 
FOOLISH HEARTS THAT I LEAVE HERE BEHIND 
WHAT WITH LYSANDER WITH DEMETRIUS 
BE NOT AFRAID SHE SHALL NOT HARM THEE HELENA NO SIR SHE SHALL NOT THOUGH YOU TAKE HER PART 
SHE WAS A VIXEN WHEN SHE WENT TO SCHOOL AND THOUGH SHE BE BUT LITTLE SHE IS FIERCE 
LITTLE AGAIN NOTHING BUT LOW AND LITTLE 
WHY WILL YOU SUFFER HER TO FLOUT ME THUS 
LET ME COME TO HER 
GET YOU GONE YOU DWARF YOU MINIMUS OF HIND'RING KNOT GRASS MADE YOU BEAD YOU ACORN 
YOU ARE TOO OFFICIOUS IN HER BEHALF THAT SCORNS YOUR SERVICES LET HER ALONE SPEAK NOT OF HELENA 
TAKE NOT HER PART FOR IF THOU DOST INTEND NEVER SO LITTE SHOW OF LOVE TO HER THOU SHALT ABY IT 
NOW SHE HOLDS ME NOT NOW FOLLOW 
IF THOU DAREST TO TRY WHOSE RIGHT OF THINE OR MINE IS MOST IN HELENA 
YOU MISTRESS 
ALL THIS COIL IS LONG OF YOU 
NAY GO NOT BACK I WILL NOT TRUST YOU I NOR LONGER STAY IN YOUR CURST COMPANY 
YOUR HANDS THAN MINE ARE QUICKER FOR A FRAY MY LEGS ARE LONGER THOUGH TO RUN AWAY 
I AM AMAZED AND KNOW NOT WHAT TO SAY 
OF COURSE BY THE END OF THE PLAY IT'S ALL WORKED OUT FINE IT'S A LOVELY HAPPY ENDING 
HERMIA MARRIES LYSANDER AND HELENA MARRIES DEMETRIUS 
BUT CAN THEIR NIGHTMARE IN THE WOOD EVER BE COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN 
THIS IS THE FIRST EVER FILMED VERSION OF SHAKESPEARE'S TWELFTH NIGHT 
THERE'S MALVOLIO THE STEWARD 
EVEN WITHOUT WORDS YOU CAN READ HIM LIKE A BOOK 
HE'S POMPOUS HUMOURLESS AND INCREDIBLY VAIN 
SICK WITH SELF LOVE 
I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PLAY MALVOLIO IN A VERSION OF ACT TWO SCENE V. 
THE LETTER SCENE MALVOLIO'S WALKING THROUGH THE GARDENS 
SPOUTING THESE DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR 
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE SEES THIS LETTER WHICH IS ACTUALLY A TRICK 
TO MAKE HIM THINK THAT HIS BOSS OLIVIA HAS GOT THE HOTS FOR HIM 
WHEN HE READS IT HE CAN'T CONTROL HIS DELIGHT HE'S SEX ON LEGS 
IT CAN BE A VERY FUNNY SCENE 
BUT TO MAKE IT WORK THE ACTOR PLAYING MALVOLIO 
HAS TO MAKE CERTAIN CHOICES 
IT'S FINDING WAYS TO PINPOINT MALVOLIO'S ARROGANCE AND VANITY 
DIFFERENT LITTLE MANNERISMS DIFFERENT AFFECTATIONS 
A FROWN A SUPERIOR STARE DOWN THE NOSE 
HAIR SCRAPED OVER A BALD PATCH 
BRIGHT RED SHOES A STIFF FORMAL WALK 
A HAUGHTY REFUSAL TO STOOP 
OR HOW ABOUT THIS SWAGGERING PREENING MALVOLIO 
MARIA ONCE TOLD ME SHE DID AFFECT ME 
AND I HAVE HEARD HERSELF COME THUS NEAR 
THAT SHOULD SHE FANCY IT SHOULD BE ONE OF MY COMPLEXION 
I REALLY LIKE THIS VERSION THIS MALVOLIO REALLY FANCIES HIMSELF 
BESIDES SHE USES ME WITH A MORE EXALTED RESPECT 
THAN ANY ONE ELSE THAT FOLLOWS HER WHAT SHOULD I THINK ON T. 
HERE'S AN OVERWEENING ROGUE O. PEACE CONTEMPLATION MAKES A RARE TURKEY COCK OF HIM 
TO BE COUNT MALVOLIO AH ROGUE PISTOL HIM PISTOL HIM 
NOW HE'S DEEPLY IN LOOK HOW IMAGINATION BLOWS HIM 
HAVING BEEN THREE MONTHS MARRIED TO HER SITTING IN MY STATE 
O. FOR A STONE BOW TO HIT HIM IN THE EYE CALLING MY OFFICERS ABOUT ME 
IN MY BRANCH'D VELVET GOWN 
FIRE AND BRIMSTONE 
THE SCENE WORKS BECAUSE HE THINKS HE'S ON HIS OWN THAT'S THE GAG 
WE CAN EAVESDROP ON HIS MOST PRIVATE THOUGHTS WHICH COME OUT AS THESE WILD SELF OBSESSED FANTASIES 
AND WE LAUGH AT THEM HE'S NOT INTENDING TO BE FUNNY BUT HE'S A FIGURE OF FUN 
THIS IS ANOTHER MUCH MORE SERIOUS VERSION IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT 
MALVOLIO AS A VICTORIAN STEWARD GETTING UNDRESSED 
TO BE COUNT MALVOLIO 
ROGUE PISTOL HIM PISTOL HIM PEACE PEACE 
THERE IS EXAMPLE FOR'T 
THE LADY OF THE STRACHY MARRIED THE YEOMAN OF THE WARDROBE 
FIE ON HIM JEZEBEL PEACE 
HAVING BEEN BUT THREE MONTHS MARRIED TO HER 
SITTING IN MY STATE CALLING MY OFFICERS ABOUT ME 
IN MY BRANCH'D VELVET GOWN 
HAVING COME FROM A DAY BED WHERE I HAVE LEFT OLIVIA SLEEPING 
FIRE AND BRIMSTONE PEACE PEACE 
AND THEN TO HAVE THE HUMOUR OF STATE 
AND AFTER A DEMURE TRAVEL OF REGARD 
TELLING THEM I KNOW MY PLACE AS I WOULD THEY SHOULD DO THEIRS 
TO ASK FOR MY KINSMAN TOBY 
FOR SHAKESPEARE'S AUDIENCE MALVOLIO WAS A DIG AT THE PURITANS 
THEY WERE A SOUR FACED BUNCH OF RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS 
OUT TO SPOIL EVEYONE'S FUN 
THEY FOUGHT TO CLOSE DOWN THEATRES BAN DANCING AND CANCEL CHRISTMAS 
NOT SURPRISINGLY THEY WERE MUCH HATED AND MOCKED 
SHAKESPEARE MAKES MALVOLIO THE PURITAN CARICATURE 
A HYPOCRITICAL SELF IMPORTANT BUSYBODY 
IF YOU THINK OF A MODERN EQUIVALENT OF MALVOLIO 
HE'D BE IN MIDDLE MANAGEMENT OR A STUCK UP CIVIL SERVANT WITH HIS PENS IN HIS TOP POCKET 
AND ALL HIS CERTIFICATES ON THE WALL 
HE'D JOIN SECRET SOCIETIES ABSOLUTELY NO ABILITY TO LAUGH AT HIMSELF 
A BIT LIKE GORDON BRITTAS IN THE BRITTAS EMPIRE 
YOU KNOW THE TRICK WITH LEADERSHIP LAURA IS TO CARRY PEOPLE ALONG WITH YOU 
YOU CAN'T FORCE THEM YOU'VE GOT TO I KNOW IT MIGHT SOUND ODD 
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THEM LOVE YOU 
BUT MALVOLIO'S POMPOSITY IS COUPLED WITH A LITTLE BIT OF REAL POWER 
IF YOU LIKE HE'S GORDON BRITTAS BUT IN ALAN B'STARD'S JOB 
HELLO ALAN B'STARD BIGGEST MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THEY HATE HIM BECAUSE HE'S POWERFUL 
HE HAS THE KEY TO THE WINE CUPBOARD AND HE ENJOYS SPOILING THEIR FUN 
TOBY APPROACHES 
CURTSIES THERE TO ME 
SHALL THIS FELLOW LIVE 
I EXTEND MY HAND TO HIM THUS 
QUENCHING MY FAMILIAR SMILE WITH AN AUSTERE REGARD OF CONTROL 
AND DOES NOT TOBY TAKE YOU A BLOW O' THE LIPS THEN 
SAYING COUSIN TOBY 
MY FORTUNES HAVING CAST ME ON YOUR NIECE 
GIVE ME THIS PREROGATIVE OF SPEECH WHAT WHAT 
YOU MUST AMEND YOUR DRUNKENNESS 
OUT SCAB 
AND SO SIR TOBY AND MARIA PLANT THE LETTER IN HIS PATH 
THAT'S GONNA MAKE HIM THINK THAT OLIVIA'S IN LOVE WITH HIM 
WHAT EMPLOYMENT HAVE WE HERE 
OH 
OH BY MY LIFE THIS IS MY LADY'S HAND 
THE LETTER IS THE MOST BRILLIANT GAG 
MALVOLIO OBVIOUSLY HAS GOT THE HOTS FOR OLIVIA SO TO MAKE HIM THINK IT'S MUTUAL 
PLAYS ON HIS MOST SORDID GRUBBY LITTLE FANTASIES 
BECAUSE BASICALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT WHAT MAKES MALVOLIO SO FUNNY IS THAT HE'S HORNY 
HE'S BEEN A RIGHT LITTLE FASCIST TELLING EVERYONE ELSE WHAT TO DO 
BUT UNDERNEATH IT HE FANCIES HIMSELF AS THIS SORT OF WILD SEX GOD 
AND THEN HE GETS THE LETTER AND THAT SAYS IT'S O. K. DON'T HIDE IT LET THESE FEELING SHOW 
I WILL SMILE 
I WILL DO EVERYTHING 
THAT THOU WILT HAVE ME 
AND OF COURSE THE RESULT'S JUST HORRIBLE 
THIS REVOLTING LEERING MONSTROSITY 
PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK MALVOLIO WOULD HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY SMILING 
THAT IS ONE WAY YOU CAN PLAY IT LIKE HE'S NEVER SMILED BEFORE 
AND HE'S EXERCISING THOSE MUSCLES FOR THE FIRST TIME 
BUT MUCH MORE GROTESQUE I THINK IS A MALVOLIO WHO ON HIS OWN 
SMILES ALL THE TIME BECAUSE SECRETLY MALVOLIO THINKS HE'S MR. SEX 
AND HE'S GOT THIS JAMES BOND SMILE THAT HE PRACTISES IN THE MIRROR 
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE'S GONNA UNLEASH IT ON THE WORLD 
SWEET LADY 
SMIL'ST THOU I SENT FOR THEE UPON A SAD OCCASION 
SAD LADY I COULD BE SAD THIS DOES MAKE SOME OBSTRUCTION IN THE BLOOD 
THIS CROSS GARTERING BUT WHAT OF THAT IF IT PLEASE THE EYE OF ONE 
IT IS WITH ME AS THE VERY TRUE SONNET IS PLEASE ONE AND PLEASE ALL 
WE'RE SETTING OUR VERSION OF THE SCENE IN A NINETEEN THIRTIES COUNTRY HOUSE 
WE COULD HAVE MADE IT MODERN BUT CLASS IS MORE BLURRED NOW THAN THEN 
IN THE THIRTIES PEOPLE WERE MORE PIGEON HOLED AND THE SCENE NEEDS THAT SENSE OF STATUS 
SO MY MALVOLIO IS A SORT OF UPMARKET ACCOUNTANT 
HE MANAGES THE ESTATE 
STIFFLY DRESSED NASTY LITTLE MOUSTACHE YES 
PERFECT 
COME THY WAYS SIGNIOR FABIAN 
NAY I'LL COME IF I LOSE A SCRUPLE OF THIS SPORT 
LET ME BE BOIL'D TO DEATH WITH MELANCHOLY 
WOULDST THOU NOT BE GLAD TO SEE THE NIGGARDLY RASCALLY SHEEP BITER 
COME BY SOME NOTABLE SHAME I WOULD EXULT MAN 
YOU KNOW HE BROUGHT ME OUT O' FAVOUR WITH MY LADY ABOUT A BEAR BAITING HERE 
TO ANGER HIM WE'LL HAVE THE BEAR AGAIN AND WE WILL FOOL HIM BLACK AND BLUE 
SHALL WE NOT SIR ANDREW 
AND WE DO NOT IT IS PITY OF OUR LIVES 
HOW NOW MY METAL OF INDIA MALVOLIO'S COMING DOWN THE WALK 
HE HAS BEEN YONDER I. THE SUN PRACTISING BEHAVIOUR TO HIS OWN SHADOW THIS HALF HOUR 
OBSERVE HIM FOR THE LOVE OF MOCKERY 
FOR I KNOW THIS LETTER WILL MAKE A CONTEMPLATIVE IDIOT OUT OF HIM 
HIDE IN THE NAME OF JESTING 
ANDREW 
HIDE 
LIE THOU THERE 
FOR HERE COMES THE TROUT THAT MUST BE CAUGHT WITH TICKLING 
TIS BUT FORTUNE 
ALL IS FORTUNE 
MARIA ONCE TOLD ME MY LADY DID AFFECT ME 
AND I HAVE HEARD HERSELF COME THUS CLOSE THAT SHOULD SHE FANCY 
IT SHOULD BE ONE OF MY COMPLEXION 
BESIDES SHE USES ME WITH A MORE EXALTED RESPECT 
THAN ANYONE ELSE THAT FOLLOWS HER 
WHAT SHOULD I THINK ON'T 
HE'S AN OVERWEENING ROGUE 
PEACE CONTEMPLATION MAKES A RARE TURKEY COCK OF HIM 
SLIGHT I COULD SO BEAT THE ROGUE SSH 
TO BE COUNT MALVOLIO 
AH ROGUE PISTOL HIM PISTOL HIM PEACE PEACE 
THERE IS EXAMPLE FOR IT 
THE LADY OF THE STRACHY MARRIED THE YEOMAN OF THE WARDROBE 
FIE ON HIM JEZEBEL 
NOW HE'S DEEPLY IN LOOK HOW IMAGINATION BLOWS HIM 
HAVING BEEN THREE MONTHS MARRIED TO HER 
SITTING IN MY STATE 
O. FOR A STONE BOW TO HIT HIM IN THE EYE 
CALLING MY OFFICERS ABOUT ME IN MY BRANC'D VELVET GOWN 
HAVING COME FROM A DAY BED WHERE I HAVE LEFT OLIVIA SLEEPING 
FIRE AND BRIMSTONE PEACE PEACE 
AND THEN TO HAVE THE HUMOUR OF STATE AND AFTER A DEMURE TRAVEL OF REGARD 
TELLING THEM I KNOW MY PLACE AS I WOULD THEY SHOULD DO THEIRS 
TO ASK FOR MY KINSMAN TOBY 
BOLTS AND SHACKLES O. PEACE PEACE NOW 
SEVEN OF MY PEOPLE WITH AN OBEDIENT START MAKE OUT FOR HIM 
I FROWN THE WHILE OR PERCHANCE WIND UP MY WATCH 
OR PLAY WITH MY SOME RICH JEWEL 
TOBY APPROACHES CURTSIES THERE TO ME 
SHALL THIS FELLOW LIVE 
THOUGH OUR SILENCE BE DRAWN FROM US BY CARS PEACE 
I EXTEND MY HAND TO HIM THUS 
QUENCHING MY FAMILIAR SMILE WITH AN AUSTERE REGARD OF CONTROL 
AND DOES NOT TOBY GIVE THEE A BLOW O' THE LIPS THEN 
AND SAY COUSIN TOBY MY FORTUNES HAVING CAST ME ON YOUR NIECE 
GIVE ME THIS PREROGATIVE OF SPEECH WHAT WHAT 
YOU MUST AMEND YOUR DRUNKENNESS

BESIDES YOU WASTE THE TREASURE OF YOUR TIME WITH A FOOLISH KNIGHT 
OH THAT'S ME I'LL WARRANT ONE SIR ANDREW I TOLD YOU IT WAS I 
FOR MANY DO CALL ME FOOL 
WHAT EMPLOYMENT HAVE WE HERE 
NOW IS THE WOODCOCK NEAR THE GIN 
AND MAY THE SPIRIT OF HUMOURS INTIMATE READING ALOUD TO HIM 
BY MY LIFE THIS IS MY LADY'S HAND 
THESE BE HER VERY C.'S HER U.'S AND HER T.'S

IT IS IN CONTEMPT OF QUESTION HER HAND HER C.'S HER U.'S AND HER T.'S

BY YOUR LEAVE WAX 
THIS WINS HIM LIVER AND ALL 
JOVE KNOWS I LOVE BUT WHO 
LIPS DO NOT MOVE NO MAN MUST KNOW

MARRY HANG THEE BROCK

LET THY TONGUE TANG ARGUMENTS OF STATE 
PUT THYSELF INTO THE STING OF SINGULARITY SHE THUS ADVISES THEE THAT SIGHS FOR THEE 
REMEMBER WHO COMMENDED THY YELLOW STOCKINGS

GO TO THOU ART MADE IF THOU DESIR'ST TO BE SO

AND IN THIS SHE MANIFESTS HERSELF TO MY LOVE 
I THANK MY STARS I AM HAPPY

I'LL BE REVENGED ON THE WHOLE PACK OF YOU 
MALVOLIO'S LAST LINES IN THE PLAY 
I WONDER WHAT SORT OF REVENGE HE COULD TAKE WHAT SORT OF REVENGE WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE 
TO BE 
OR NOT TO BE 
IS THIS A DAGGER 
THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT I SEE 
ROMEO ROMEO WHEREFORE ART THOU ROMEO 
O. FOR A MUSE OF FIRE 
THAT WOULD ASCEND THE BRIGHTEST HEAVEN OF INVENTION 
A KINGDOM FOR A STAGE PRINCES TO ACT 
AND MONARCHS TO BEHOLD THE SWELLING SCENE 
I WONDER WHAT AN AUDIENCE WOULD MAKE OF THIS TODAY 
ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH DEAR FRIENDS ONCE MORE 
CLOSE THE WALL NOT WITH OUR ENGLISH DEAD 
WHAT A WRETCHED AND PEEVISH FELLOW IS THIS KING OF ENGLAND 
TO MOPE WITH HIS FAT BRAINED FOLLOWERS 
SO FAR OUT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE 
IF THE ENGLISH HAD ANY APPREHENSION THEY WOULD RUN AWAY 
THE GAME'S AFOOT FOLLOW YOUR SPIRIT AND UPON THIS CHARGE CRY 
GOD FOR HARRY ENGLAND AND SAINT GEORGE 
EAT 
SHALL WE ADD SOME MORE SAUCE TO IT 
THERE'S WITCHCRAFT IN YOUR LIPS KATE 
SHAKESPEARE'S AIM WAS TO ENTERTAIN A LARGE ELIZABETHAN AUDIENCE 
SO HE CHOSE THEMES THAT HAD ALREADY PROVED POPULAR WITH THE PUBLIC 
IN THE THEATRE HE COULD REACH A WIDE CROSS SECTION OF THE PUBLIC 
IN HIS DAY IT WAS POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT 
ION THE WAY THAT CINEMA AND T. V. IS TODAY 
YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE IT 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE LONDON WAS WHERE IT WAS ALL HAPPENING 
WHY HERALD DOES THY MASTER SEND TO ME TO BURY THE DEAD 
LET HIM BURY THEM I. GOD'S NAME 
WHERE IS MY LORD HIGH CONSTABLE AND THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE HAD MY RANSOM 
APPRENTICES 
TRADESMEN PROSTITUTES VAGABONDS 
A SLICE OF SOCIETY 
WHAT CASTLE IS THIS SO NEAR ADJOINING OUR CAMP 
THEY'VE COME TO HEAR THESE TRAVELLING PLAYERS' 
WOULD THIS TANKARD WERE FULL 
WOULD THIS TAVERN WERE EMPTY 
THE BATTLE OF AGINCOURT 
THERE ARE WORSE PLACES TO WORK 
MANY A TALE GETS TOLD IN THIS ALEHOUSE 
NEVER A DAY PASSES WITHOUT THESE TWO BEARING NEWS 
WHAT ALL YOUR SWINE DEAD WITCHCRAFT 
FROM ROUND HERE 
COULD BE ANYONE WHAT THEY DIE OF PLAGUE 
NO PIGS ARE PROTECTED BY DIRT 
AND WITCHES NEVER GET IT PROTECTED BY DEMONS TRUE TRUE 
THE PURITANS SAY TIS THE BLASPHEMERS AND FORNICATORS WHAT GETS IT 
AND THOSE WHO VISIT THE PLAYHOUSES 
I SHOULD THINK THESE PLAYERS HAVE IT BY NOW 
THIS PLAY'S ABOUT HENRY V. AND HIS CONQUEST OF FRANCE I'VE SEEN IT ABOUT TEN TIMES 
THE PLAY IS THE FAMOUS VICTORIES NO ONE KNOWS WHO WROTE IT 
EVERYONE LOVES THIS SCENE BETWEEN THE FRENCH AND THE ENGLISH SOLDIER 
COME YOU OH I WILL SIR I WILL 
COME YOU PEASANT I WILL WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU 
MARRY YOU SHALL GIVE ME ONE TWO THREE FOUR HUNDRED CROWNS 
NAY I WILL GIVE YOU MORE SIR 
I WILL GIVE YOU AS MANY CROWNS AS WILL LIE ON YOUR SWORD 
AS MANY CROWNS AS WILL LIE ON MY SWORD MARRY WILL I 
BUT YOU MUST FIRST LAY DOWN YOUR SWORD OR THEY WILL NOT LIE ON IT 
A HA 
HA THOU VILLAIN 
FLAG'S FLYING 
THE GLOBE THE BIG NEW PLAYHOUSE THAT'S OPENED 
THERE'S A PLAY ON TODAY I CAN'T GO 
I'M WORKING OH GO ON IT'S THAT NEW PLAY HENRY V. BY SHAKESBEAN 
SHAKSPAR 
SHAKESPEARE 
YOU REMEMBER AT THE ROSE 
RICHARD THE THIRD CROOKBACK DICK THERE WAS A REAL STINKER OF A KING 
SLAYING THE LITTLE PRINCES AS THEY SLEPT 
AND THAT QUEEN ANNE HER THAT SPAT IN HIS FACE 
AND ALLOWED HIM INTO HER BEDCHAMBER 
THE GLOBE WILL BE PACKED PISH THE MORE THE MERRIER 
HOW MUCH IS IT A PENNY FOR STANDING IN THE PIT 
A PENNY I CAN SEE THE BEAR BAITING FOR THAT 
WHO WANTS TO STAND FOR THREE HOURS WATCHING A PLAY HERE LISTEN 
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT KINGS AND QUEENS LOOK LIKE 
HOW THEY SPEAK WHAT THEY THINK HOW THEY BEHAVE 
HOW PEOPLE PLOT AGAINST THEM 
HOW THEY MURDER 
HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO SEE YOUR LORDS AND MASTERS MOCKED BY FOOLS 
WHAT'S MORE THE PURITANS HATE THEATRE AND WANT IT BANNED 
WAIT THERE I'LL ASK HERE HERE 
LOOK LIKE THE INNOCENT FLOWER BUT BE THE SERPENT UNDER IT SHAGSPAR 
TOLD HER I NEED SOME LEECHES FOR AN AILMENT WELL DONE SIR 
NO PROFIT GROWS WHERE NO PLEASURE IS TAKEN 
WELL YOU WOULD WOULDN'T YOU 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE THE CITY OF LONDON WAS CONTAINED WITHIN A WALL 
THERE'S NOT MUCH LEFT OF IT TODAY 
PROBABLY WASN'T MUCH FUN TO LIVE THERE 
THE CITY FATHERS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
THOUGHT IT A GOOD IDEA TO CLOSE DOWN MOST OF THE ENTERTAINMENT AVAILABLE 
THEY DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING THAT WOULD CAUSE TOO MUCH NOISE OR DISTURBANCE 
THEY ALSO THOUGHT ANYONE ENJOYING THEMSELVES WASN'T WORKING 
AND THEY FEARED THAT ENTERTAINMENT COULD LEAD TO RIOTOUS BEHAVIOUR 
IF YOU WANTED ENTERTAINMENT YOU HAD TO GET OUT OF THE CITY 
FOR MOST PEOPLE THAT MEANT GOING SOUTH OF THE RIVER 
THERE YOU COULD PAY TO SEE BEAR BAITING COCK FIGHTING 
SWORD FIGHTING OR SOMETHING NEW THEATRES 
OR PUBLIC PLAYHOUSES AS THEY WERE CALLED THEN 
THE FIRST PERMANENT PUBLIC PLAYHOUSE WAS CALLED THE THEATRE 
THE SECOND WAS CALLED THE CURTAIN 
GOING THERE BECAME THE THING TO DO 
IT WAS A PLACE AT WHICH TO BE SEEN 
AND WHERE YOU COULD OBSERVE ALL CROSS SECTIONS OF SOCIETY 
AND HEAR FULL LENGTH PLAYS ON A GRAND STAGE 
IT WAS A DARING PLACE TO VISIT 
PURITANS CONDEMNED THIS NEW ENTERTAINMENT 
IN HIS SCATHING ATTACK ON THE FIRST TWO THEATRES 
JOHN NORTHBROOK WROTE 
IF YOU WILL LEARN HOW TO BE FALSE HOW TO MURDER HOW TO SPEAK FILTHY 
AND HOW TO MOCK 
SHALL NOT YOU LEARN THEN AT SUCH PLAYS HOW TO PRACTISE THEM 
THESE ATTACKS DID NOT PREVENT NEW THEATRES OPENING 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE THE GLOBE OPENED THIS WAS TO BECOME THE MOST FAMOUS 
SHAKESPEARE OWNED IT WITH HIS FELLOW ACTORS 
HE CALLED IT A WOODEN O. 
CAN THIS COCKPIT HOLD THE VASTY FIELDS OF FRANCE 
OR MAY WE CRAM WITHIN THIS WOODEN O. 
THE VERY CASQUES THAT DID AFFRIGHT THE AIR AT AGINCOURT 
FOR OVER FORTY YEARS THE GLOBE STAGED THE PLAYS OF SHAKESPEARE 
UNTIL IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTY TWO THE PURITANS CLOSED ALL THE THEATRES IN LONDON DOWN 
ENDING ONE OF THE GREATEST PERIODS IN BRITISH HISTORY 
AND FOUR HUNDRED HUNDRED YEARS LATER 
FOLLOW ME 
THEY PACK AROUND THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE INTO THIS THEATRE 
ABOUT ONE THOUSAND IN THIS AREA WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE YARD 
THEY'D BE THE GROUNDLINGS 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW HOW MANY NO ONE WOULD COUNT THEM COMING IN 
AND NO ONE STOPPED MORE COMING IN WHEN IT WAS FULL 
ONE COMMENTATOR THOMAS DECKER DESCRIBED THEM AS STINKARDS 
WHO ARE SO GLUED TOGETHER BY THE STEAM OF STRONG BREATH 
THAT WHEN THEY CAME FORTH THEIR FACES LOOKED PAR BOILED 
HE'D OBVIOUSLY NEVER BEEN DOWN HERE 
YOU CAN MOVE AROUND EAT DRINK JOIN IN 
GET TOTALLY CARRIED AWAY WITH THE PERFORMANCE 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO HOPE IT DOESN'T RAIN OR GET DARK TOO EARLY 
SO WHY WAS THE GLOBE SO POPULAR 
AUDIENCES CAME FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS 
TO HEAR A RICH MIXTURE OF PLAYS 
FROM TRAGEDIES TO COMEDIES ROMANCES TO HISTORIES 
TO SEE ACTORS DRESSED UP AS KINGS AND QUEENS LORDS AND LADIES 
IT WAS AN IMPRISONABLE OFFENCE TO DRESS AS A HIGHER MEMBER OF SOCIETY 
AND TO SEE PROMINENT PEOPLE IN SOCIETY MOCKED 
JUST AS WE DO TODAY 
MY HORSE IS MY MISTRESS 
YOUR MISTRESS BEARS WELL 
THEN BELIKE SHE WAS OLD AND GENTLE 
YOU HAVE GOOD JUDGMENT IN HORSEMANSHIP 
I'D RATHER HAVE MY HORSE TO MY MISTRESS 
I'D RATHER HAVE MY MISTRESS A JADE THOU MAKEST USE OF ANYTHING 
YET I WILL NOT USE MY HORSE FOR MY MISTRESS 
SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS WERE APPRECIATED ON DIFFERENT LEVELS 
A GHOST MIGHT HAVE ENTHRALLED THE GROUNDLINGS 
THE GENTRY MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IT MORE IN THEIR STRIDE 
AND DISCUSSED GHOSTS AND DEMONS 
THERE WAS THE DELIGHT OF HEARING NEW WORDS AND PHRASES 
WORDS SUCH AS LONELY LAUGHABLE COURTSHIP AND APPARITION 
WERE ALL ADDED TO ENGLISH BY SHAKESPEARE 
AS WERE PHRASES LIKE YOU KNOCK PATED PUKE STOCKINGED SMOOTH TONGUED SPANISH POUCH 
GOD BLESS YOU ANCIENT PISTOL YOU SCURVY LOUSY KNAVE 
GOD BLESS YOU EH 
ART THOU BEDLAM HENCE 
I AM QUALMISH AT THE SMELL OF LEEK I BESEECH THEE SCURVY LOUSY KNAVE 
TO EAT LOOK YOU THIS LEEK 
BECAUSE YOUR AFFECTIONS AND DIGESTION DOES NOT AGREE WITH IT 
I WOULD DESIRE YOU TO EAT IT 
NOT FOR CADWALLADER AND ALL HIS GOATS 
THERE'S ONE GOAT FOR YOU 
NOW FROM UP HERE YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD VIEW 
WOODEN SEATS 
SHELTERED 
YOU CAN ALSO SIT OVER THERE 
THESE SEATS ARE VERY INTERESTING YOU DIDN'T GET THE BEST VIEW 
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY YOU SAT HERE 
YOU SAT HERE TO BE SEEN BY EVERYONE ELSE 
BEGONE 
THESE SEATS ARE RESERVED FOR LORD STRANGER'S PARTY STINKARD 
FOR A PENNY YOU CAN STAND DOWN HERE 
MOVE ABOUT DRINK SOME ALE EAT SOME NUTS 
CHEER AT THE PERFORMERS DRINK SOME MORE ALE GO HOME WITH A PROSTITUTE 
I MUCH PREFER IT DOWN HERE THERE'S A LOT MORE ATMOSPHERE 
YOU ALSO GET TO MEET MORE INTERESTING PEOPLE DOWN HERE 
I HOPE THIS IS BETTER THAN BEAR BAITING THIS PLAY IS ABOUT HENRY V. 
HIM THAT STUCK IT UP FRANCE 
THEY NEED IT STUCK UP THEM AGAIN AND THOSE SPANISH 
I'M READY TO FIGHT I'M READY TO FIGHT 
THEY RECKON THE SPANISH ARE ABOUT TO INVADE THE ISLE OF WIGHT 
BRITAIN HAS BEEN WAGING WAR WITH THE SPANISH FOR FIFTEEN YEARS 
THERE'S OFTEN PANIC THAT THEY MAY INVADE 
ONCE THIRTY THOUSAND TROOPS WENT TO MILE END TO STOP A RUMOURED INVASION HEY 
THE PLAY LOOK 
O. FOR A MUSE OF FIRE 
THAT WOULD ASCEND THE BRIGHTEST HEAVEN OF INVENTION 
A KINGDOM FOR A STAGE PRINCES TO ACT 
AND MONARCHS TO BEHOLD THE SWELLING SCENE 
BUT PARDON GENTLES ALL 
THE FLAT UNRAISED SPIRITS THAT HATH DARED 
ON THIS UNWORTHY SCAFFOLD TO BRING FORTH SO GREAT AN OBJECT 
CAN THIS COCKPIT HOLD THE VASTY FIELDS OF FRANCE 
OR MAY WE CRAM WITHIN THIS WOODEN O. 
THE VERY CASQUES THAT DID AFFRIGHT THE AIR AT AGINCOURT 
TO BE 
OR NOT TO BE 
IS THIS A DAGGER 
THAT IS THE QUESTION WHICH I SEE 
ROMEO ROMEO WHEREFORE ART THOU ROMEO 
A LOT IS KNOWN ABOUT SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS 
BUT ONLY THIS MUCH ABOUT HIS LIFE 
I'M NOT SURE WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE 
THREE PAINTINGS ALL DIFFERENT AND ALL DONE AFTER HIS DEATH 
HE DIDN'T KEEP A DIARY AND HAD NO BIOGRAPHER WHILE HE WAS ALIVE 
WE DO KNOW THAT HE LEFT STRATFORD FOR LONDON 
PROBABLY TO SEEK FAME AND FORTUNE IN THE THEATRE 
WHEN HE WAS THERE HE ACHIEVED SUCCESS AS A PLAYWRIGHT AND ACTOR 
SHAKESPEARE WAS ALSO A SHAREHOLDER IN A THEATRE THE GLOBE 
WHICH GAVE HIM THE CHANCE TO PERFORM HIS PLAYS PUBLICLY 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW SHAKESPEARE STAGED OR REHEARSED HIS PLAYS 
BUT WE DO KNOW THE CHALLENGES THE ACTORS FACED 
WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT FROM THOSE FACED TODAY 
LET ME HAVE MEN ABOUT ME THAT ARE FAT 
SLEEK HEADED MEN SUCH AS SLEEP NIGHTS 
CASSIUS HAS A LEAN AND HUNGRY LOOK 
I'D LOVE TO BE AN ACTOR 
YOU GET TO DRESS UP AND SPEAK LIKE LORDS 
KILL KINGS SPEAK THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND THE MOST FILTHY LANGUAGE 
SAY TREASONOUS AND UNGODLY THINGS HAVE THE BACKING OF POWERFUL PEOPLE 
THEN THERE'S THE FAME AND THE GLORY 
BUT TO BE SUCCESSFUL AS AN ACTOR YOU NEED TO BE PART OF A COMPANY 
LIKE THIS LOT 
THESE ACTORS ARE HEARING A PLAY FOR THE FIRST TIME TO APPROVE IT 
THEY'LL THEN GO AWAY AND LEARN THEIR PARTS 
THERE'S ONE HAND WRITTEN COPY OF THE PLAY OWNED BY THE BOOK KEEPER 
THE ACTORS ONLY GET GIVEN THE LINES FOR THEIR PART 
IT'S NOT EASY YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO LEARN YOUR ROLE QUICKLY 
THIS COMPANY ARE REHEARSING SHAKESPEARE'S NEW PLAY JULIUS CAESAR 
CALPURNIA PEACE HO CAESAR SPEAKS 
CALPURNIA HERE MY LORD 
THERE'S ABOUT TWELVE ACTORS ALL OF WHOM PROBABLY OWN A SHARE IN THE COMPANY 
SOME HAVE A SHARE IN THE PLAYHOUSE AND SO A SHARE IN THE TAKINGS 
I SHALL REMEMBER 
WHEN CAESAR SAYS DO THIS IT IS PERFORMED 
SET ON AND LEAVE NO CEREMONY OUT 
CAESAR WHO CALLS 
BID EVERY NOISE BE STILL PEACE YET AGAIN WHO IN THE PRESS CALLS ON ME 
I HEAR A TONGUE SHRILLER THAN ALL THE MUSIC CRY CAESAR 
SPEAK CAESAR IS TURNED TO HEAR BEWARE THE IDES OF MARCH 
WHAT MAN IS THAT A SOOTHSAYER BIDS YOU BEWARE THE IDES OF MARCH 
SET HIM BEFORE ME LET ME SEE HIS FACE 
THEY REHEARSE IN THEIR OWN CLOTHES 
FOR THE PERFORMANCE THEY MIGHT WEAR A TOGA 
SOME ACTORS HAVE TO PLAY MORE THAN ONE ROLE 
SOOTHSAYER NOW BUT A DIFFERENT CHARACTER LATER 
WHAT SAY'ST THOU TO ME NOW SPEAK ONCE AGAIN 
BEWARE THE IDES OF MARCH 
HE IS A DREAMER LET US LEAVE HIM PASS 
BEWARE THE IDES OF MARCH 
NOW IS THE TIME TO BE AN ACTOR 
IT'S A REAL PROFESSION 
THANKS TO SHAKESPEARE AND OTHER WRITERS 
THEATRE IS THE MOST POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT IN LONDON 
IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY 
BEFORE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THERE WERE NO PERMANENT PUBLIC PLAYHOUSES 
YOU TRAVELLED AROUND AND PERFORMED WHEN YOU FOUND AN AUDIENCE 
OH AND YOU NEEDED A LICENCE 
TO BE GRANTED BY A LORD OR A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE 
PERFORM WITHOUT A LICENCE AND YOU MAY BE THROWN IN JAIL AS A VAGABOND 
GUILTY OF PESTERING THE COUNTRY 
IF YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH OR LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE GRANTED A LICENCE 
IT GAVE YOU FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROTECTION AND STATUS 
SOME COMPANIES EVEN GOT ROYAL SUPPORT 
THIS LED TO THE OPENING OF PUBLIC PLAYHOUSES 
MANY PEOPLE IN HIGH PLACES WERE AGAINST THE IDEA OF PLAYHOUSES 
THERE WERE ATTACKS FROM PURITANS AND THE CLERGY 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN JOHN NORTHBROOK BELIEVED THE STAGE TO BE 
A SPECTACLE 
AND SCHOOL FOR ALL WICKEDNESS AND VICE TO BE LEARNED IN 
IN FACT THE SCHOOL OF SATAN 
LET US HEAR WHAT ANTONY CAN SAY 
GENTLE ROMANS PEACE HO LET US HEAR HIM 
FRIENDS ROMANS COUNTRYMEN LEND ME YOUR EARS 
MERELY A SIGN OF DISBELIEF FROM THE GROUNDLINGS 
RUBBISH 
STINKARDS 
IMAGINE PLAYING TO A CROWD OF THREE THOUSAND 
HALF OF WHOM ARE DRUNK AND YELL ABUSE AT YOU 
WHAT IF THE AUDIENCE GETS RAINED ON OR IT GETS DARK BEFORE IT'S OVER 
WHAT WOULD KEEP THEM ENTERTAINED 
TO SURVIVE YOU NEED A HEALTHY IRREVERENCE FOR SHAKESPEARE 
IF SOMEBODY SHOUTS SOMETHING AT YOU 
YOU EITHER PRETEND THEY DIDN'T SAY IT 
WHICH MEANS HE KNOWS HE'S GOT YOU 
OR IN SOME WAY YOU ANSWER BACK 
YOU ARE IN AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL POSITION HERE 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PARTICULARLY CLEVER 
IN HENRY V. ACTORS WOULD JUST LOOK AT PEOPLE 
AN ACTOR WOULD JUST LOOK AT THEM 
AND IF THEY LOOK EVERYBODY ELSE IS INVITED TO LOOK 
DOTH FORTUNE PLAY THE HUSSY WITH ME NOW 
NEWS HAVE I THAT MY NELL IS DEAD IN THE SPITAL 
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY MOBILE STAGE AS WELL 
THERE'S NOWHERE TO HIDE ONSTAGE AND NOWHERE IN THE AUDIENCE 
IN SHAKESPEARE'S TIME THEY'D PERFORM IN THE DAY 
SO SAY IN MACBETH PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE DARK TO PRETEND IT'S DARK 
OOH DARK ISN'T IT 
HOW GOES THE NIGHT BOY THE MOON IS DOWN 
I HAVE NOT HEARD THE CLOCK SHE GOES DOWN AT TWELVE 
I TAKE TIS LATER SIR HOLD 
TAKE MY SWORD 
THERE'S HUSBANDRY IN HEAVEN THEIR CANDLES ARE ALL OUT 
A SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR WOULD NEVER GET THE WHOLE PLAY JUST HIS PART 
THERE WAS NO COPYRIGHT SO YOU COULD TAKE THE PLAY TO A PRINTER 
PUBLISH IT AND YOU WOULD SHARE THE PROFITS 
YOU ONLY GOT YOUR PART SO YOU DIDN'T GET THE WHOLE PLAY 
AND YOU COULDN'T SELL IT OFF 
MASTERS HERE ARE YOUR PARTS 
I ENTREAT YOU AND DESIRE YOU TO CON THEM BY TOMORROW NIGHT 
AND MEET ME IN THE PALACE WOOD 
THERE WILL WE REHEARSE 
IF WE MEET IN THE CITY WE WILL BE DOGGED WITH COMPANY 
AND OUR DEVICES KNOWN 
I WILL DRAW A BILL OF PROPERTY SUCH AS OUR PLAY WANTS 
I PRAY YOU FAIL ME NOT 
IN THE GLOBE'S RECENT PRODUCTION OF HENRY V. 
THEY DOUBLED UP ON ROLES AS THEY WOULD HAVE IN SHAKESPEARE'S DAY 
WHICH MAKES MUCH AGAINST MY MANHOOD 
I MUST LEAVE THEM SEEK SOME BETTER SERVICE 
I PLAY TWO CHARACTERS PRINCESS KATHARINE AND THE BOY 
BEING DIFFERENT SEXES IT'S HARD TO SWAP THE BODY LANGUAGE 
THE BOY IS A HARD LONDON LAD 
AND THE PRINCESS IS A VERY FEMININE FRENCH PRINCESS 
SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO SWAP BETWEEN THEM 
HOPEFULLY I'LL LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL IN MY DRESS 
EVERYONE THEY WON'T MAKE FUN OF IT TOO MUCH 
THERE'S WITCHCRAFT IN YOUR LIPS KATE 
YOU'VE GOT THE IDEAL OPPORTUNITY TO BLAST THE AUDIENCE WITH YOUR POWER 
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR SPECIAL EFFECTS 
THERE'S NO BACKDROPS BECAUSE YOU CUT OFF THE SIGHT LINES 
THERE'S NO EXTRA SCENERY IT'S NOT DESIGNED TO MAKE PICTURES IN 
NO YOU'VE GOT TO BLAST AWAY AND MAKE EYE CONTACT 
THE GAME'S AFOOT FOLLOW YOUR SPIRIT AND UPON THIS CHARGE CRY 
GOD FOR HARRY 
ENGLAND AND SAINT GEORGE 
I THINK SOLILOQUIES WORK WELL HERE BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THE AUDIENCE 
THERE'S A SENSE OF TALKING DIRECTLY TO PEOPLE 
BUT IN MODERN THEATRES WE THINK OF SOLILOQUIES AS BEING INTERNALISED 
IF IT WERE DONE WHEN TIS DONE 
THEN T'WERE WELL IT WERE DONE QUICKLY 
BUT IF YOU'RE FORCED TO TALK TO PEOPLE 
IF IT WERE DONE WHEN TIS DONE THEN T'WERE WELL IT WERE DONE QUICKLY 
THEN YOU'RE FORCED TO EXPLAIN IT 
HE'S SAYING IF THAT WOULD BE THE FINISH OF IT THEN I WOULD DO THIS 
I WOULD KILL DUNCAN 
MACBETH IS TALKING ABOUT HIS DIFFICULTY WITH KILLING THE KING 
PACK IT UP PACK IT IN 
LET ME BEGIN 
YOU HAVE TO THINK OF SHAKESPEARE ALMOST LIKE A RAPPER 
HE HAS A RHYTHM AND IF YOU TAKE IT ON IT DRIVES THE PLAY THROUGH 
AND IT EMPOWERS YOU 
THE FIRST TIME I'M ASKED TO READ A SCRIPT OUT LOUD 
I'M TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THE WORDS 
YOU CAN'T PERFORM IT UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND EVERY WORD 
ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU CAN USE THE LANGUAGE 
YOU SAY TO YOURSELF IF THESE WERE MY WORDS 
IF I WAS IN THIS SITUATION HOW WOULD I USE IT 
WHAT WOULD I SAY SO IT COMES ALIVE WHEN YOU SAY IT OUT LOUD 
SO IN WINTER'S TALE WHEN I BRING NEWS OF THE QUEEN'S DEATH 
I COME ON AND STOP EVERYTHING AND SAY WOE THE WHILE 
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT IN REAL LIFE BUT I'VE GOT TO USE THOSE WORDS 
I'LL SHOW YOU A SCENE FROM WINTER'S TALE 
YOU'RE SHOWING ME A SCENE I'D LIKE YOU TO BE THE KING 
KING LEONTES MAYBE KNEEL DOWN HERE WHAT'S GOING ON 
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THE KING HAS LOST HIS SON WHO HAS DIED 
AND I'M BRINGING NEWS OF HIS QUEEN'S DEATH 
BAD DAY YES HE'S ALREADY FEELING UNHAPPY BECAUSE HE'S RESPONSIBLE 
I COME IN AND USING SHAKESPEARE TELL HIM WHY HE IS RESPONSIBLE 
LET'S MAKE THE LANGUAGE MEAN MORE THAN JUST ON THE PAGE O. K. 
SO IF YOU CAN JUST BE THERE 
WOE THE WHILE 
O. CUT MY LACE LEST MY HEART CRACKING IT BREAK TOO 
WHAT STUDIED TORMENTS TYRANT HAST FOR ME 
WHAT WHEELS RACKS FIRES 
WHAT FLAYING BOILING IN LEADS OR OILS 
WHAT OLD OR NEWER TORTURE MUST I RECEIVE 
WHOSE EVERY WORD DESERVES TO TASTE OF THY MOST WORSE 
USE THE STAGE FULLY GET THE RIGHT RHYTHM PLAY TO THE AUDIENCE 
HOW YOU DO PLAGUE ME A PESTILENCE ON YOU GO HANG YOURSELF 
A BURNING DEVIL TAKE YOU BEETLE HEADED KNAVE 
BEETLE HEADED KNAVE OH THAT'S GOOD 
SHAGSPAR WITHOUT A DOUBT YOU RABBLE OF VILE CONFEDERATES 
HERD OF BOILS AND PLAGUES 
FOUL AND PESTILENT CONGREGATION OF VAPOURS 
COSTUMES PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT PART 
THE AUDIENCE LOVE SEEING ACTORS DRESSED AS THE RULING CLASS 
IT'S CONSIDERED ANTI ESTABLISHMENT 
COSTUMES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE SO THE PLAYERS GET WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD 
SOME NOBLES LEAVE THEIR COSTUMES TO THE THEATRE WHEN THEY DIE 
PERFORMANCES ARE IN CONTEMPORARY DRESS WITH SOME HISTORIC ELEMENTS 
THE BOYS WHO PLAY THE FEMALE ROLES ARE RESPECTED AND TRAINED ACTORS 
UNTIL THEIR VOICES BREAK THAT IS 
THE WOODEN O. BECKONS 
THIS IS IT MY BIG CHANCE 
MY FIRST JOB AS A HIRELING A SORT OF TRAINEE ACTOR 
I'M PLAYING THE COBBLER IN JULIUS CAESAR 
I HOPE NO ONE THROWS ANY NUTS AT ME 
WHERE IS THY LEATHER APRON AND THY RULE 
WHAT DOST THOU WITH THY BEST APPAREL ON YOU SIR WHAT TRADE ARE YOU 
SIR IN RESPECT OF A FINE WORKMAN I AM AS YOU WOULD SAY A COBBLER 
BUT WHAT TRADE ART THOU ANSWER ME DIRECTLY 
A TRADE SIR THAT I HOPE I MAY USE WITH A SAFE CONSCIENCE 
WHICH IS INDEED SIR A MENDER OF BAD SOLES 
WHAT TRADE THOU NAUGHTY KNAVE WHAT TRADE 
NAY I BESEECH YOU SIR BE NOT OUT WITH ME 
BUT IF YOU BE OUT SIR I CAN MEND YOU WHAT MEANST THOU BY THAT 
MEND ME THY SAUCY FELLOW WHY SIR COBBLE YOU 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S GOOD ABOUT THIS JOB IS THAT YOU GET LONG TRAIN JOURNEYS LIKE THIS ONE TO PARIS 
YOU CAN GET YOUR TEETH STUCK INTO SOMETHING MEATY LIKE UM THE GOTHIC REVIVAL BY KENNETH CLARK 
THAT IS THE SORT OF BOOK THAT FLOATS MY BOAT 
ONE REASON I LOVE READING HISTORY SO MUCH IS THAT WHEN I WAS A CHILD I LOVED THE LADYBIRD BOOKS 
BIOGRAPHIES OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE I REMEMBER THE ACCURATE WATERCOLOURS 
MY DAUGHTERS LOVE FICTION 
THEY LOVE BIG SWIRLY STORIES 
CECILE'S OBSESSED BY MERMAIDS 
HERMIONE IS OBSESSED BY A BOOK ABOUT A MOLE WHO'S TRYING TO FIND WHO'S POOED ON HIS HEAD WHICH I ENJOY TOO 
I REALLY LOVE BEDTIME READING 
IT'S A SPECIAL TIME OF THE DAY WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO NOD OFF TO SLEEP 
YOUR BODY'S AT REST SOMEHOW YOUR MIND'S FREE OF THE DAY'S WORRIES 
SO YOU CAN CONCENTRATE AND USE YOUR IMAGINATION A BIT MORE 
READING TAKES YOU ON AN ADVENTURE EITHER SHARING IT BY READING TO SOMEONE OR BY BEING READ TO 
OR JUST GOING OFF AND HAVING THE STORY TOLD TO YOU BY ITS AUTHOR 
I'M READING WILLY RUSSELL'S NOVEL THE WRONG BOY 
A STORY ABOUT A BOY WHO GROWS UP WITH DIFFICULTIES AROUND HIM IT'S VERY FUNNY BUT ALSO VERY TRAGIC 
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT MOMENT EVERY NIGHT WHEN I CAN SHARE THE YOUNG MAN'S JOURNEY THROUGH LIFE 
AT THE MOMENT MOST OF MY READING TAKES PLACE IN FRONT OF MY CHILDREN 
I READ TO THEM AT NIGHT TO GET THEM OFF TO SLEEP SIX OR SEVEN BOOKS 
RICHARD SCARY BOOKS ARE FAVOURITES TAKING PLACE IN BUSYTOWN THEY FEATURE CHARACTERS LIKE LOWLY WORM 
DOCTOR SEUSS IS ANOTHER FAVOURITE AND OF COURSE WHERE WOULD WE BE WITHOUT SPOT 
BUT IF YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU THREE GOOD BOOKS TO READ THAT I RECOMMEND 
THE THIRTY NINE STEPS BY JOHN BUCHAN 
J. D. SALINGER THE CATCHER IN THE RYE YOU MUST READ IT 
THEN WHY NOT FOLLOW IT UP WITH A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES BY JOHN KENNEDY TOOLE 
IF I WAS A HOSTAGE AND I HAD TO CHOOSE THREE BOOKS IT'S THESE THREE
