DEEP IN SPACE LIES SUPERHERO SCHOOL 
ITS NEXT STUDENT IS BOLDLY GOING TO LEARN WHAT NO SUPERHERO HAS LEARNED BEFORE 
YES THIS IS THE STORY OF MATHS MAN 
HE LIKES TO KEEP IN SHAPE IT'S MATHS MAN 
DEAR OH DEAR 
WHERE ON MARS IS HE 
MATHS MAN'S JUST ENTERED THE INTERGALACTIC SPACE WEB 
FINALLY 
HI I'M MATHS MAN MATHEMATICAL SUPERHERO 
YOU ARE LATE 
WHICH IS A PITY BECAUSE TODAY'S LESSON IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT 
COME ALONG 
I HAVE PLACED THREE CRYSTALS SOMEWHERE ON EARTH 
YOUR CHALLENGE IS TO FIND THEM 
HERE ARE YOUR DIRECTIONS TO FIND THE FIRST ONE 
YOU'LL LAND IN FRONT OF A WISHING WELL MAKE A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREE TURN ANTI CLOCKWISE WALK FORWARD AND 
EH FORGIVE ME YOUR WHOLENESS WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
WELL I'M GIVING DIRECTIONS WHY ARE YOU LOST 
OH DEAR WELL WE CAN'T HAVE YOU GETTING LOST 
EM OH VERA BEFORE HE LEAVES HE NEEDS A LESSON IN MOVING AROUND MATHS 
AFFIRMATIVE YOUR WHOLENESS I'LL BE BACK LATER 
WHICH PART OF THE DIRECTIONS DIDN'T YOU UNDERSTAND 
WELL I UNDERSTAND CLOCKWISE LOOK 
THAT MEANS TURNING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE HANDS OF A CLOCK 
AND ANTI CLOCKWISE IS THE OTHER WAY 
BUT THE BIT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY AND DEGREES I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT 
VERY WELL LET'S GO BACK TO WHEN WE LEARNED ABOUT ANGLES 
ANGLES ARE A MEASURE OF TURN 
AND THE AMOUNT OF TURN IS MEASURED IN DEGREES 
IF THE TURN IS A COMPLETE TURN WE SAY IT IS A TURN OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES 
THAT'S THE NUMBER THREE HUNDRED SIXTY WITH THE DEGREE SIGN AFTER IT 
ALL RIGHTY 
WATCH THIS VERA 
ARE WE READY 
ONE COMPLETE TURN OR THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES 
GOOD NOW MATHS MAN IF YOU WERE TO MAKE A HALF TURN 
THE AMOUNT OF TURN WOULD BE HALF OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES WHICH IS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
OFF WE GO AGAIN 
A HALF TURN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES EXCELLENT MATHS MAN 
IF YOU WERE TO MAKE A QUARTER TURN THAT WOULD BE HALF OF A HALF TURN 
AND HALF OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES IS NINETY DEGREES 
SO A QUARTER TURN IS THE SAME AS NINETY DEGREES 
I'VE SEEN THAT AMOUNT OF TURN BEFORE 
THAT ANGLE IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS A SQUARE ANGLE 
WHICH TO CALL IT BY ITS PROPER NAME IS A RIGHT ANGLE 
VERY IMPRESSIVE MATHS MAN 
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT 
HEY WATCH THIS 
ONE QUARTER THAT'S ONE RIGHT ANGLE 
TWO QUARTERS MAKES TWO RIGHT ANGLES 
THREE QUARTERS THREE RIGHT ANGLES 
FOUR QUARTERS OR ONE COMPLETE TURN 
SO IN ONE WHOLE TURN THERE ARE FOUR QUARTER TURNS OR FOUR RIGHT ANGLES 
WELL DONE MATHS MAN 
I THINK YOU'RE EQUIPPED FOR YOUR FIRST CHALLENGE ON EARTH AND LISTEN OUT FOR MY INSTRUCTIONS 
COOL 
UP UP AND AWAY 
OH THERE YOU ARE MATHS TEAM 
TURN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES CLOCKWISE 
RIGHT IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES IS A HALF TURN 
AND CLOCKWISE IS THIS WAY THE SAME AS A CLOCK 
HERE WE GO 
NOW WALK FORWARD UNTIL YOU GET TO A LITTER BIN 
AT THE LITTER BIN TURN NINETY DEGREES ANTI CLOCKWISE 
STILL WITH ME MATHS TEAM 
THIS IS GETTING EASIER 
AHEAD OF YOU IS A PATH 
WALK ALONG THIS PATH RIGHT TO THE END THERE YOU WILL SEE A CREATURE CALLED A TAPIR 
HERE MAKE A NINETY DEGREE TURN CLOCKWISE 
O. K. MATHS TEAM A NINETY DEGREE TURN IS THE SAME AS A QUARTER TURN 
AHEAD OF YOU YOU WILL SEE A PEN WITH RABBITS IN IT 
INSIDE YOU WILL FIND YOUR FIRST CRYSTAL 
EXCUSE ME RABBITS I MEAN YOU NO HARM 
I'VE EH JUST COME FOR THAT CRYSTAL THANK YOU 
I'VE GOT ME FIRST CRYSTAL D. A. RAH O. K. STAND BACK RABBITS 
GOT IT WELL DONE MATHS MAN 
DO I GET MY BADGE NOW DEARIE ME NO YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN HOW TO GET AROUND USING MAPS FIRST 
MAPS AREN'T THEY LIKE A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF SOMEWHERE EXACTLY 
AND VERA IS SHOWING US A MAP OR A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE LEARNING POD 
AND THESE SYMBOLS HELP US KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AT ANY GIVEN TIME OH YES 
THERE MUST BE THE DOOR THAT'S RIGHT 
AND THAT MUST BE THE WORKBENCH YES 
AND WE MUST BE ABOUT HERE EXACTLY MATHS MAN WELL DONE 
VERA WILL TAKE OVER RIGHT 
TO HELP YOU FIND YOUR WAY AROUND A MAP WE CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE DIVIDE IT INTO SQUARES 
THE SQUARES RUNNING UP AND DOWN OR VERTICALLY WE CALL COLUMNS 
AND THE SQUARES RUNNING ACROSS OR HORIZONTALLY ARE CALLED ROWS 
ON THIS MAP LET'S GIVE OUR COLUMNS LETTERS 
ALL THE SQUARES HERE ARE IN COLUMN C. 
LET'S GIVE OUR ROWS NUMBERS 
SO ALL THESE SQUARES ARE IN ROW THREE 
TO FIND A POSITION ON A MAP YOU NEED TO KNOW TWO THINGS 
THE COLUMN THAT IT'S IN AND THE ROW THAT IT'S IN 
A GRID REFERENCE GIVES US THAT INFORMATION 
C. THREE IS A GRID REFERENCE 
THAT'S COLUMN C. 
AND ROW THREE 
WHERE THEY MEET IS OUR POSITION 
WHICH IS THIS SQUARE 
DO THE COLUMNS ALWAYS COME FIRST YES MATHS MAN 
COLUMNS FIRST AND THEN ROWS TO HELP YOU REMEMBER THINK OF THIS 
GO INTO THE HOUSE ALONG THE COLUMNS THEN UP THE STAIRS UP THE ROWS 
SO TO FIND D. FOUR WE GO INTO THE HOUSE 
ALONG THE COLUMNS UNTIL WE REACH D. 
AND THEN UP THE STAIRS UP THE ROW UNTIL WE GET TO FOUR 
WHERE THE TWO CROSS IS D. FOUR 
IN D. FOUR IS THE BREAKFAST BAR AND ON THAT 
IS YOUR FIRST CLUE AND A MAP OF THE THEME PARK TO HELP YOU FIND THE NEXT CRYSTAL 
GOOD LUCK MATHS MAN 
UP UP AND AWAY 
PHEW IT'S PLASTIC 
RIGHT 
RIGHT UHUH 
RIGHT B. TWO B. TWO RIGHT 
INTO THE HOUSE ALONG TO B. THERE AND UP THE STAIRS TO TWO 
AND WHERE THEY MEET IS B. TWO 
OH AND WHAT'S IN B. TWO 
LOOKS LIKE A PIRATE SHIP WONDER IF I CAN SEE THE MAST 
OH THAT LOOKS LIKE A MAST WELL SHIVER ME TIMBERS 
BETTER HEAD THIS WAY THEN 
PHEW HERE'S THE NEXT GRID REFERENCE 
RIGHT WELL I KNOW I'M IN B. TWO THERE 
NOW WHERE'S A FOUR 
O. K. INTO THE HOUSE TO A A.'S THE FIRST ONE 
UP THE STAIRS TO FOUR FOUR'S AT THE TOP WHERE THEY MEET IS A FOUR 
HEY IT LOOKS LIKE A TALL SLIDE 
OH AND THERE IT IS THE TALL SLIDE BETTER HEAD THAT WAY EH 
HA 
B. FOUR THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT RIGHT LET'S FIND IT 
IN THE HOUSE TO B. AND UP THE STAIRS TO FOUR 
WHERE THEY MEET IS B. FOUR 
HEY IT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE 
MARVELLOUS 
I'LL SEE YOU DOWN THERE 
HERE WE GO 
GOT IT 
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED DO I GET MY BADGE NOW 
THOUGHT NOT YOU'VE MORE TO LEARN 
COMPASS POINTS 
COMPASS POINTS M. M. M. WHAT ARE THEY 
PEOPLE ON EARTH USE THEM ALL THE TIME TO FIND THEIR WAY AROUND 
VERA WILL EXPLAIN 
MATHS MAN STAND IN THE CENTRE OF THE POD 
A COMPASS SHOWS SEVERAL DIRECTIONS 
THESE ARE CALLED COMPASS POINTS 
THE MAIN COMPASS POINTS ARE NORTH 
EAST 
SOUTH AND WEST 
ON A COMPASS YOU USUALLY ONLY SEE THE FIRST LETTER OF EACH WORD 
TO REMEMBER THEM REPEAT THIS SAYING NEVER EAT SLIMY WORMS 
NEVER EAT SLIMY WORMS 
GOOD LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY 
NORTH NEVER EVER MOVES 
PEOPLE MIGHT MOVE AROUND AND CHANGE THEIR DIRECTION 
BUT NORTH IS ALWAYS THE SAME 
I'LL SHOW YOU 
TURN AND FACE SOUTH 
NOW WHERE IS NORTH 
BEHIND ME 
NOW TURN TO FACE WEST 
NOW WHERE IS NORTH IT'S TO MY RIGHT OR NINETY DEGREES CLOCKWISE 
WELL DONE NOW TURN TO FACE EAST 
AND TELL ME WHERE IS NORTH 
IT'S TO MY LEFT OR NINETY DEGREES ANTI CLOCKWISE 
SO YOU SEE MATHS MAN YOUR POSITION AND DIRECTION CHANGED BUT NORTH STAYED IN THE SAME PLACE 
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT NOW ONE LAST THING 
YOU WILL SEE IN BETWEEN THE MAIN FOUR COMPASS POINTS EXACTLY HALFWAY IN BETWEEN 
ARE MORE COMPASS POINTS 
N. E. STANDS FOR NORTHEAST 
S. E. IS SOUTHEAST 
S. W. IS SOUTHWEST 
AND I SUPPOSE N. W. STANDS FOR NORTHWEST 
WELL DONE MATHS MAN 
TIME FOR YOUR FINAL CHALLENGE ON EARTH AND THIS TIME THE CHALLENGE IS ALSO FOR YOUR MATHS TEAM 
COULD YOU HOLD THAT FOR ME CERTAINLY THANK YOU 
STAND BACK A MOMENT OH YES THANKS
