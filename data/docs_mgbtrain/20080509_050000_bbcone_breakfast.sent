GOVERNMENT IN BURMA SAID IT DOES 
NOT WANT FOREIGN WORKERS TO ENTER 
THE COUNTRY 
TWENTY FIVE WILL BUY MOSQUITO NETS 
A CALL FOR DONATIONS BY THE 
DISASTERS EMERGENCY COMMITTEE IT 
HAS A HISTORY OF SUCCESSFUL APPEALS 
BUT HELPING THE PEOPLE OF BURMA 
COMES WITH A CHALLENGE CONVINCING 
DONORS THAT ANY AID THEY HAVE PAID 
FOR WILL BE ALLOWED IN 
AS FOR MONEY GETTING THROUGH FUNDS 
RAISED BY THIS APPEAL WILL ONLY BE 
ALLOCATED BY THE D. E. C. TO MEMBER 
CHARITIES WHO HAVE PERMISSION TO

THE UNITED NATIONS SAYS FIFTEEN MILLION 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SEVERELY AFFECTED 
BY LAST WEEK'S CYCLONE THE UN IS 
WARNING OF A WORST TRAGEDY IF 
FRUSTRATIONS OVER ACCESS CONTINUE 
TO LIMIT THE AID GETTING THROUGH

NEGATIVE PICTURE AND THOSE HOPING 
TO SECURE DONATIONS ARE KEEN TO 
STRESS THEY CAN REACH THOSE IN NEED 
WELL I CAN GIVE ASSURANCES ON THAT 
GIVEN THAT SAVE THE CHILDREN AND 
OTHER D. E. C. AGENCIES HAVE BEEN MA 
BURMA FOR MANY YEARS WE HAVE 
THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS ON THE 
GROUND GROUND THEY ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE 
SAVE THE CHILDREN SAYS IT REACHED 
SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH FOOD WATER AND 
SHELTER SHELTER AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL TEAM FROM 
MERLIN ARRIVED IN THE AREA IT WILL 
IT WILL USE A RIVER CRUISER TO

THE RED CROSS SAYS ONE FLIGHT OF 
GERRY CANS ARRIVED TODAY THERE ARE 
WARNINGS ANY EFFECTIVE RELIEF 
EFFORT WILL NEED MORE AID THAN THIS 
WE WILL SPEAK TO ONE OF OUR 
CORRESPONDENTS IN THE REGION LATER 
CHILDREN CHILDREN WHO STILL 
STRUGGLE TO READ BY THE AGE OF SIX 
HAVE OVERTAKEN THE REST OF THEIR 
CLASS AFTER A FEW HOURS AFTER 
SPECIALIST ONE TO ONE TEACHING THE 
GOVERNMENT BACKED EVERY CHILD A 
READER SCHEME SAYS IT HAS BEEN SO 
SO SUCCESSFUL IT WILL BE ROLLED OUT 
TO ALL PRIMARY SCHOOLS 
STRUGGLING TO READ SHOCKINGLY SIX 
OUT OF EVERY ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN NEVER 
LEARN PROPERLY AND LEAVE SCHOOL 
BARELY LITERATE BUT THAT WON'T 
HAPPEN TO HELEN SHE AND OTHERS AT 
THIS SCHOOL BENEFIT FROM INTENSIVE 
ONE TO ONE TUITION HALF AN HOUR A 
DAY FOR SIX MONTHS AND IT IS 
SHOWING DRAMATIC RESULTS 
IT IS HARD BECAUSE I CAN'T READ THE 
WORDS PROPERLY 
AND AND NOW IS IS IT GETTING 
EASIER YES EASIER YES RESEARCH BY THE INSTITUTE OF 
EDUCATION FOUND THE APPROACH 
BROUGHT THE WORST IN THE CLASS UP 
TO ABOVE AVERAGE IT IS EXPENSIVE 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PUPIL SO IT WORTH IT I I KNOW FROM THE WAY SCHOOLS OPERATE 
IF YOU DON'T ADDRESS ISSUES IN THE 
EARLY YEARS IN KEY STAGE ONE LATER 
ON YOU GET TRIPLE THE PROBLEMS AND 
DOUBLE THE COST YES READING 
RECOVERY IS EXPENSIVE BUT IT IS 
WORTH IT 
THE GOVERNMENT TOO IS IMPRESSED AND 
HAS PROMISED TO ROLL OUT THE SCHEME 
ACROSS ENGLAND OVER THE NEXT THREE 
YEARS YEARS IF READING RECOVERY IS SO EFFECTIVE 
IT RAISES SOME QUESTIONS THE 
SYSTEM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG 
TIME SO WHY WASN'T IT INTRODUCED 
YEARS AGO IF IT HAD BEEN HOW MANY 
CHILDREN'S LIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN 
TRANSFORMED 
THE AUSTRIAN MAN WHO IMPRISONON HIS 
DAUGHTER FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS IS EXPECTED 
TO APPEAR IN COURT TODAY A JUDGE 
WILL DECIDE WHETHER JOSEF FRITZL 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE REMANDED IN 
CUSTODY AS THE INVESTIGATION 
CONTINUES CONTINUES FRITZL KEPT HIS DAUGHTER IN 
CELLAR AND FATHERED SEVEN CHILDREN 
WITH HER 
HOME OWNERS STRUGGLING WITH THEIR 
MORTGAGE PAYMENTS DURING THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH ARE TO GET FREE LEGAL AID TO 
AVOID LOSING THEIR HOMES 
THE HOUSING MINISTER SAID THE MOVE 
WOULD HELP FAMILIES MORE SUPPORT 
WILL BE GIVEN FOR ORGANISATIONS 
PROVIDING DEBT ADVICE 
THE BODY OF A MAN KILLED IN A HUGE 
EXPLOSION AT HOUSE IN NORTH WEST 
LONDON HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE 
RUBBLE OVERNIGHT 
TWO OTHER PEOPLE WERE SERIOUSLY 
INJURED IN THE BLAST WHICH 
DESTROYED THREE HOUSES POLICE 
BELIEVE IT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED 
DELIBERATELY DELIBERATELY GORDON RAMSAY SAYS BRITISH 
RESTAURANTS SHOULD BE BANNED FROM 
SERVING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES THAT 
AREN'T IN SEASON SPEAKING TO B. B. C. 
NEWS HE SAYS THE MOVE WOULD HELP 
THE ENVIRONMENT BY CUTTING DOWN ON 
FOODS BEING TRANSPORTED AROUND THE 
WORLD HE SAID IT WOULD FORCE CHEFS 
TO COME UP WITH BETTER AND MORE 
CREATIVE DISHES 
THERE SHOULD BE LAWS FINED YOU 
KNOW LICENSING LAWS TO MAKE SURE 
THIS PRODUCE IS ONLY USE INDEED 
SEASON AND SEASON ONLY AND THE 
QUICKER WE GET THAT LEGISLATION 
PUSHED THROUGH THE HOUSES OF 
PARLIAMENT THE MORE UNIQUE THIS 
COUNTRY WILL BECOME 
THE PLANNED OVERHAUL OF THE N. H. S. IN 
ENGLAND WILL BENEFIT PATIENTS AND 
STAFF ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT 
LORD DARZI WHO IS LEADING REVIEW 
OF THE HEALTH SERVICE PLEDGED THAT 
ANY DECISIONS WILL BE MADE AT A 
LOCAL LEVEL CRITICS SAY THE 
CHANGES WILL LEAD TO THE CLOSURE OF 
HOSPITAL DEPARTMENTS AND THE 
UNDERMINING OF LOCAL G. P. SURGERIES 
LITTLE REUBEN HAD A FIT A FEW 
YEARS AGO THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT 
SEVERAL DAY INS HOSPITAL BUT HE 
HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THIS SPECIAL 
UNIT WHICH WILL TREAT HIM AND LET 
HIM GO HOME AND CALL HIM BACK FOR 
MORE TREATMENT KIDS RECOVER BETTER 
AT HOME AND IT IS LESS STRESS FOR 
THE FAMILY THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE 
CHILDREN'S JOURNEYS THROUGH THE N. H. S. 
SIMPLER IT IS THE KIND OF THING 
THIS RERUE IS ABOUT EACH REGION 
PRODUCING ITS OWN SET OF REFORMS 
SUGGESTED BY STAFF AND PATIENTS 
RATHER THAN BEING IMPOSED FROM 
ABOVE ABOVE THE MAN LEADING THE REVIEW IS LORD 
DARZI HEALTH MINISTER AND SURGEON 
THE GOVERNMENT IS KEEN TO EMPHASISE 
HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE 
HEALTH SERVICE SO WILL THESE 
CHANGES MEAN DIFFERENT PRIORITIES 
IN DIFFERENT AREAS MORE OF 
POSTCODE LOTTERY 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES AND 
THAT IS A REFLECTION OF THE 
CHANGING NATURE OF MEDICINE AND 
THIS IS WHY THIS REVIEW WILL ALLOW 
AT A LOCAL LEVEL FOR PEOPLE TO 
APPRAISE WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE 
AND DEAL WITH THESE PRIORITIES IN 
THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE WAY 
CRITICS SAY THE REAL AGENDA IS IS 
GETTING RID OF SMALL G. P. PRACTISES 
AND REPLACING THEM WITH NEW HEALTH 
CENTRES LIKE THIS ONE AND THE N. H. S. 
HAS SEEN TOO MUCH CHANGE ALREADY 
DESPITE CONCERNS ABOUT FALLING 
HOUSE PRICES A WOODEN BEACH HOUSE 
ON THE SUFFOLK COAST IS EXPECTED TO 
SELL FOR OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND THE ESTATE 
AGENTS SAY THE PRICE REFLECTS THE 
HIGH DEMAND FOR PROPERTIES IN THAT 
AREA THE HUT IN SOUTHWOLD IS JUST 
ONE ROOM IT HAS A VERANDA BUT 
COMES COMPLETE WITH LOUNGING CHAIRS 
AND A WINDBREAK 
JUST TO CONFIRM THAT EIGHTY THOUSAND 
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT EIGHTY THOUSAND 
I THINK IT DOES OVERLOOK THE SEA

CONGESTION CONGESTION A LOT OF INTEREST IN JOSEF FRITZL 
AND HIS STATEMENT TO POLICE HE HAS 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT MIGHT OF 
DRIVEN HIM TO DO WHAT HE DID AND HE 
MADE THE LINK WITH HITLER HE 
TALKED ABOUT HIS MOTHER 
I CONFESS ELISABETH DID NOT 
OBEY RULES SHE GAVE BIRTH ALONE L. 
GOT HER A MEDICAL BOOK 
THE DAILY MAIL THIS IS THE STORY 
ABOUT ANT AND DEC AND I. T. V. THEY ARE 
SAYING THAT THERE WAS AN AWARD THAT 
ANT AND DEC WERE GIVEN AND IT 
SHOULDN'T OF BEEN GIVEN TO THEM AND 
VIEWERS WERE CONNED WHEN THEY WERE 
VOTING WHEN THE WHOLE THING HAD 
BEEN FIXED 
BANKS CRITICISED FOR RAMPING UP 
FEES ON CURRENT ACCOUNTS BECAUSE OF 
FEARS GROWING THAT THE DAYS OF FREE 
BANKING MIGHT BE NUMBERED 
A COUPLE OF INSIDE PAGES ARE YOU 
GOING TO DO THE ONE ABOUT THE 
MEMORY LADY 
I FIND MY MEMORY IS 
GETTING WORSE JILL PRICE SHE IS 
FORTY TWO SHE SAYS ALTHOUGH YOU THINK IT 
MIGHT BE A GIFT TO RECALL THINGS 
EASILY SHE CAN REMEMBER EVERYTHING 
SHE CONDITION SWITCH OFF HER MEMORY 
SHE LIKENS HER LIFE TO A A SPLIT 
SCREEN TELEVISION ON ONE SIDE IS 
WHAT SHE IS DOING AT THE MOMENT AND 
ON THE OTHER SIDE IS A CONSTANT 
STREAM OF MEMORIES 
LINKED TO A TRAUMATIC MOVE IN HER 
LIFE WHEN SHE MOVED FROM ONE 
COUNTRY TO ANOTHER 
AND EVERY 
MEMORY IS TRIGGERED BY LITTLE 
THINGS LITTLE SMELLS SUDDENLY A 
FLOOD OF MEMORIES COMES BACK 
LEWIS HAMILTON THERE INVOLVED IN A 
STUNT FOR ONE OF HIS SPONSORS BUT 
ONE OF THE MOST EMBARRASSING LITTLE 
ENDEAVOURS HE HAD TO FLY AROUND 
AND DO EMBARRASSING WAVING AND 
PRETEND TO BE A SPACEMAN AND DOING 
JOUSTING WITH THE SWORD AND 
EVERYBODY WHO WATCHED IT SAID IT 
WAS AGONISING AND HE LOOKED 
EMBARRASSED EMBARRASSED THAT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU HAVE 
TO DO FOR YOUR SPONSORS 
CHARITIES SAY THEY CAN GET AID 
THROUGH TO TO THOSE WHO NEED IT IN 
BURMA BURMA LET'S SPEAK TO OUR REPORTER WHO IS 
ON THE BORDER BETWEEN BURMA AND 
THAILAND THAILAND DAN GIVE US AN IDEA OF THE ONGOING 
PROBLEMS GETTING AID INTO THE 
COUNTRY WHAT'S THE OBSTACLES BEING 
FACED AT THIS STAGE 
WELL WHERE I'M STANDING NOW 
ACTUALLY IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF 
THE PROBLEM FACING THE 
INTERNATIONAL AID AGENCIES I'M ON 
THE BORDER BETWEEN THAILAND AND 
BORDER BORDER JUST OVER THERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED METERS 
AWAY IS BURMA IT IS AS CLOSE AS 
THATMENT NOW YOU WOULD WOULD EXPECT 
THIS TO BE AN IDEAL PLACE FOR LORRY 
LOADS OF AID TO GO ACROSS AND INTO 
BURMA BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WE 
HAVE BEEN HERE FOR OVER TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN A SINGLE LORRY 
LOAD OF AID GOING ACROSS THE BORDER 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING TO 
AGENCIES THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LET 
THAT AID IN AT THE MOMENT OF 
COURSE FOR THE AID AGENCIES HERE 
IN THAILAND IT IS A A FRUSTRATING 
SITUATION THEY HAVE THE AID HERE 
READY TO GO THEY HAVE THE EXPERTS 
HERE READY TO GO BUT THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES SIMPLY AREN'T LETTING 
THEM IN AT THE MOMENT 
IN 
SOME CASES 
DAN IT SEEMS 
THERE 
ARE AID AGENCIES 
OPERATING 
BURMA BUT 
THEY 
BURMA BUT YOU ARE SUGGESTING THEY CANNOT GET 
TO DISTRIBUTE 
ABSOLUTELY THAT'S RIGHT A FEW AID 
FLIGHTS HAVE MANAGED TO GET IN SO 
FAR AND WE 
AID 
AGENCIES THAT ALREADY 
HAVE 
IN BURMA ARE 
DISTRIBUTING THE AID 
IN BURMA ARE DISTRIBUTING THE AID THEY 
HAD IN COUNTRY BEFORE 
THEY HAD IN COUNTRY BEFORE THIS CYCLONE 
HIT THE PROBLEM 
CYCLONE HIT THE PROBLEM IS THEY NEED TO 
GET THE 
BECAUSE WHAT 
BURMA 
NOT ENOUGH 
TO MEET THE DEMAND 
THE NUMBER 
HAD 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN MADE 
HOMELESS WHO 
HAVE NOTHING 
MADE HOMELESS WHO HAVE NOTHING BECAUSE 
OF THIS 
CYCLONE AND REALLY 
AT THE 
MOMENT THE SITUATION 
LOOKING INCREASINGLY 
BLEAK ALL THE 
TIME IT IS 
NOT LIKE IN THE 
TIME IT IS NOT LIKE IN THE AFTERMATH 
WHERE THERE WAS A HUGE AMOUNT 
OF 
INTERNATIONAL AID RUSHING TO THAT REGION IT IS 
MORE LIKE 
REGION IT IS MORE LIKE THE FAMINES IN 
NORTH KOREA IN 
THE MID NINETEEN NINETY WHEN 
THE INTERNATIONAL 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OFFERED TO 
HELP AND NORTH KOREA 
TO HELP AND NORTH KOREA SAID NO AND YOU 
SITUATION 
IN 
OF THIS CYCLONE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE BUSINESS NEWS NOW 
HOW ABOUT CHEWING GUM THAT WASHES 
OFF IN WATER THIS IS DONE BY A 
COMPANY SET UP BY BRISTOL 
UNIVERSITY THE INVENTORS SAY IT IS 
WATER BASED AND CLEAN IT TASTES 
JUST LIKE ORDINARY CHEWING GUM IT 
WILL BE VERY WELCOME FOR COUNCILS 
AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO HAVE TO PAY 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THE YEAR TO CLEAN OFF 
THE OLD CHEWING GUM THE OTHER BIG 
STORY IS OF COURSE OFF THE BACK 
OF THE STORY ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT 
OFFERING FREE LEGAL ADVICE TO 
PEOPLE FACING REPOSSESSION LET'S 
HOPE THERE ARE ENOUGH LEGAL 
ADVISERS APPEAR WE ARE EXPECTED TO 
HEAR TODAY THAT THE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES IS 
SOARING WE EXPECT TO HEAR THAT 
FROM THE CITIZENS' ADVICE BUREAU 
THEY EXPECT THE NUMBER TO REACH 
FORTY FIVE THOUSAND THIS YEAR UP FROM EIGHT THOUSAND IN 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR TWO THOUSAND FOUR A COUPLE OF BRITISH ENERGY STORIES 
WE'LL SOON FIND OUT WHO MIGHT BE 
INTERESTED IN MAKING A BID FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT'S STAKE IN BRITISH 
ENERGY IT DOES SEEM BIDDING WAR 
MAY NOT GO AHEAD BECAUSE POTENTIAL 
BIDDERS LIKE SUEZ AND EON HAVE 
RULED THEMSELVES OUT OF IT BUT 
BIDS ARE EXPECTED FROM GERMANY'S 
R. W. E. AND FRANCE'S E. D. F. THEY ARE 
EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN AT SEVEN HUNDRED PENCE 
PER SHARE AND IN THE FINANCIAL 
TIMES TODAY IT REPORTS THAT E. D. F. 
HAS A BACK UP PLAN AND IS BUYING 
LAND NEXT TO NUCLEAR POWER SIDES IN 
CASE IT DOES NOT WIN THE BID IT 
WILL THEN BUILD ITS OWN NUCLEAR 
POWER STATIONS 
COMING UP AT SIX FIFTY AM JOIN ME OFF 
THE COAST OF LINCOLNSHIRE AT THE 
WORLD'S BIGGEST OFFSHORE WIND FARM 
IS THIS THE ANSWER TO BRITAIN'S 
CLEAN GREEN ENERGY NEEDS 
AND THE 
F. T. S. E. IS UP ABOUT TEN POINTS AFTER 
SOME GOOD TAKEOVER TALK IN THE 
MINING INDUSTRY A WILL BE BACK AT 
SIX FIFTY AM SIX FIFTY AM YOU ARE WATCHING BREAKFAST FROM B. B. C. 
NEWS THE MAIN STORIES THE UNITED 
NATIONS HAS SAID IT IS EXTREMELY 
DISAPPOINTED AT THE SLOW PROGRESS 
BEING MADE IN GETTING AID TO THE 
VICTIMS OF THE BURMESE CYCLONE 
CHILDREN UNDER SIX WITH READING 
DIFFICULTIES WILL BE GIVEN EXTRA 
ONE TO ONE TUITION ACROSS ENGLAND 
AFTER SUCCESSFUL TRIALS 
AND WE'LL BE LOOKING AT A NEW 
SCHEME TO HELP OLDER DRIVERS BRUSH 
UP ON THEIR SKILLS BEHIND THE WHEEL 
AND WE ARE IN SUFFOLK WITH THE 
SENIOR CITIZENS HEADING BACK ONTO 
THE ROAD IT IS PART OF A CAMPAIGN 
TO KEEP SENIOR CITIZENS SAFE BEHIND 
THE WHEEL 
WHAT HAS THE WEEKEND WEATHER GOT IN 
STOCK CAROL KIRKWOOD IS IN 
FOR A LOT OF US IT IS SUNSHINE IN 
PLYMOUTH A MURKY START THE REASON 
I AM HERE'S BECAUSE ON SUNDAY A 
TRANSATLANTIC YACHT RACE UP TAKES 
PLACE IT STARTS AT TWO P. M. AND IS ONE 
OF THE TOUGHEST IT GOES ABOUT AS 
FAR NORTH IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AS 
ONE WOULD CARE TO GO YOU ENCOUNTER 
FOG AND ICEBERGS MORE ON THAT 
LATER NO ICEBERGS IN THE FORECAST 
TODAY BUT THERE IS MORE CLOUD 
AROUND TODAY THAT WE HAVE HAD IN 
THE LAST FEW DAYS THE CLOUD WILL 
PRODUCE SOME SHOWERS BUT FOR MANY 
A BUS WE ARE LOOKING AT HAZY 
SUNSHINE TEMPERATURES STILL IN THE 
TWENTIES ON THE SATELLITE PICTURE A 
DISTINCTIVE BAND OF CLOUD THAT 
EXTENDS ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
THROUGH WALES IN THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND INTO THE SOUTH EASTERN 
CORNER ANOTHER GLORIOUS START TO 
THE DAY WITH A FAIR BIT OF SUNSHINE 
AND SOME HIGH CLOUD AS WE GO 
FURTHER NORTH INTO THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND MORE CLOUD THAN WE HAVE 
BEEN USED TO WITH SOME SHOWERS 
THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND SEEING 
SOME SUNSHINE AND THE SAME ACROSS 
THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND AS WE MOVE 
INTO THE SOUTH WEST OF SCOTLAND 
MORE CLOUD WITH ONE OR TWO SHOWERS 
AND SOME SHOWERY RAIN ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND THAT SHOWERY RAIN 
EXTENDS INTO WALES AND PARTS OF THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND IT IS WORTH 
NOTING ALONG THE COAST LINE OF 
WALES IN THE SOUTH WEST THERE IS 
QUITE A BIT OF LOW CLOUD MIST AND 
FOG ON THE HEADLAMPS THAT WILL 
STICK FOR MOST OF THE DAY THROUGH 
THE DAY THAT BAND OF CLOUD 
ENCROACHES FURTHER NORTH ON THE 
HEADLAMPS SHOWERS ESPECIALLY 
ACROSS WALES AND THE MIDLANDS TOP 
TEMPERATURE IS TWENTY SEVEN THIS EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT THE SHOWERS DYING OUT 
MORE CLOUD ACROSS SCOTLAND MILD 
AND TOMORROW ANOTHER FINE DAY FOR 
MANY PARTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
BUT STILL THE RISK OF SOME SHOWERS 
TWENTY EIGHT DEGREES CELSIUS IS EIGHTY TWO DEGREES 
FAHRENHEIT NORMALLY IT WOULD BE 
ABOUT SIXTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS THIS TIME 
OF YEAR ON SUNDAY SCOTLAND AND 
NORTHERN IRELAND WILL SEE MORE 
SHOWERS AND FOR MUCH OF ENGLAND AND 
WALES THERE WILL BE SOME SUNSHINE 
ALTHOUGH THE NORTH OF ENGLAND COULD 
SEE SOME SHOWERS TEMPERATURES 
STILL A VERY HEALTHY 
THE PASSING YOUR DRIVING TEST AGED 
SEVENTEEN MAYBE ONE THING BUT WHAT ABOUT 
PASSING YET AGAIN WHEN YOU ARE SEVENTY 
OLDER DRIVERS ARE BEING ASKED TO 
CHECK WHETHER THEY ARE STILL FIT TO 
GET BEHIND THE WHEEL BY TAKING A 
TEST WHICH MEASURES THEIR SIDE 
HEALTH AND REACTIONS MIKE 
CARTWRIGHT IS IN FELIXSTOWE 
THIS MORNING ABOUT TEN OR SO 
DRIVERS WILL BE FILTERING IN THEY 
ARE AROUND AMONG FIVE MILLION SENIOR 
CITIZENS WITH DRIVING LICENCES 
ONCE YOU ARE SEVENTY AS LONG AS YOU 
FULFIL THE MEDICAL CONDITIONS YOU 
CAN DRIVE AT FOR AS LONG AS YOU 
LIKE BUT IN SUFFOLK THEY ARE 
ASKING WHETHER ALL THE DRIVERS ARE 
MORE VULNERABLE ON THE ROADS THAT 
IS WHY THEY SET UP HIS CAUSE 
YESTERDAY WE WENT OUT WITH ONE 
ELDERLY CITIZEN 
DRIVE AS YOU WOULD NORMALLY AGED AGED SIXTY NINE MAUREEN MILLROY DROVE FOR THIRTY NINE 
YEARS WITHOUT AN ACCIDENT BUT 
RECENTLY HER CAR AND HER 
CONFIDENCE TOOK A KNOCK AFTER 
SOMEBODY DROVE INTO THE BACK OF HER 
THAT IS WHY SHE JOINED THIS COURSE 
MY CHILDREN THINK CAN TERRIBLE 
DRIVER I THINK I AM TERRIBLE DRIVER 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR SPEED DRIVER I NORMALLY TRY AND KEEP TO ABOUT SIXTY 
AFTER FEW YEARS YOU TEND TO GET 
IN A RUT WITH YOUR DRIVING YOU 
FEEL CONFIDENT BUT PERHAPS HE WAS 
STILL MAKING A FEW NOT VERY GOOD 
JUDGEMENTS ON THE ROAD TO HAVE 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HELPS YOU FIND 
THOSE PROBLEM AREAS DRIVING DRIVING INSTRUCTOR ADRIAN SAYS HE HAS SEEN 
HOW ACCIDENTS CAN HAPPEN USUALLY USUALLY WHEN YOU COME TO JUNCTIONS BUSY 
AREAS AND PLACES THEY ARE NOT USED 
TO IF THEY COME ACROSS A DIVERSION 
AND END UP SOMEWHERE THEY ARE NOT 
FAMILIAR WITH THEY END UP ON THE 
WRONG ROAD 
JUST LIKE THIS ELDERLY 
COUPLE WHO TURNED THE WRONG WAY UP 
A DUAL CARRIAGEWAY IN NORFOLK THE 
ONCOMING CAR HAD TO STOP BEFORE 
THEY REALISED THEIR MISTAKE TURNED 
AROUND AND CARRIED ON 
ONE OF THE 
ISSUES WITH DRIVING IS THAT IT IS A 
COMPLEX ACTIVITY YOU ARE REQUIRED 
TO DO LOT OF THINKING VERY 
QUICKLY ESPECIALLY AT SPEED IF 
YOU COME ACROSS A NEW SITUATION 
WHERE YOU HAVE TO REACT QUICKLY AS 
YOU GET OLDER THAT TAKES LONGER 
SOMETIMES SHE MIGHT MAKE A MISTAKE 
MAUREEN SAYS SHE HAS BECOME 
BETTER DRIVER WITH AGE YOUNG YOUNG PEOPLE TEND TO PUT THEIR FOOT DOWN 
THEY SHOULD REMEMBER THAT THEY WILL 
BE MY AGE ONE DAY THEN PERHAPS 
THEY WOULD HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR 
THE ROAD AND PEOPLE ON IT 
WELL MAUREEN ISN'T HERE AT THE 
MOMENT BUT I AM TOLD HE DID 
EXTREMELY WELL ON THE CAUSE TAKE 
LOOK AT THIS SIGN DO YOU RECOGNISE 
IT PART OF THIS COURSE IS A 
HIGHWAY CODE TEST ALL KINDS OF 
THINGS GOING ON PEOPLE COME AND 
HAVE THEIR EYES TESTED WHAT IS THE 
PURPOSE OF THE TEST 
IT IS THE SAME 
AS AT THE OPTICIANS WE ENTER THE 
DETAILS INTO THE MACHINE L. TESTED 
ONE I THEN THE OTHER RIDE FOR 
NIGHT TIME AND DAYTIME ACUITY AND 
FULL GLARE 
IT ISN'T JUST PHYSICAL 
TESTS BUT COGNITIVE TESTS AS WELL 
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THIS 
ISN'T JUST JOINING DOTS IT IS A 
VERY SERIOUS TEST INDEED JOINING 
ME IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HELPED 
PUT THIS TEST TOGETHER THIS LOOKS 
LIKE CHILD'S PLAY 
THIS USES THE 
SAME MENTAL PROCESSES THAT ARE USED 
TO DURING DRIVING SO GOOD 
PERFORMANCE ON THIS TEST INDICATES 
THAT THEY WILL BE QUITE GOOD IN THE 
DRIVING ENVIRONMENT THEY WILL USE 
THE SAME SKILLS IN THAT CONTEXT I I KNOW COURSES LIKE THIS HAVE GONE ON 
IN OTHER PLACES WHAT IS SO 
DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS COURSE THE THE DEPTH OF ASSESSMENT IS MUCH GREATER 
THAN THE SORT OF THING WHICH HAS 
BEEN DONE IN THE PAST REASSESS THE 
EYESIGHT WE ASSESS THE EYESIGHT 
AND WE DO COGNITIVE TESTING IT IS 
BASED ON PREVIOUS ACADEMIC RESEARCH 
WE USED AS PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 
AS WELL AS A PRACTICAL DRIVING 
ASSESSMENT IT CULMINATES IN A ONE TO ONE 
TRAINING PROGRAMME 
THE ANSWER TO 
THAT QUESTION THAT IS THE 
NATIONAL SPEED LIMIT 
WE KNEW THAT 
IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR VIEWS 
ON OLDER PEOPLE AT THE WHEEL I 
THINK IT IS TRUE THAT STATISTICALLY 
THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THAT MANY 
ACCIDENTS ACCIDENTS THEY ARE SAFER THAN VERY YOUNG 
DRIVERS BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK DO 
YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE MORE 
REGULAR ASSESSMENTS AS WE GET 
OLDER OLDER STILL TO COME ARE WE A NATION OF 
NASTY NEIGHBOURS LIVING ON UNSAFE 
STREETS DAVID SILLITO HAS A 
PASSIONATE DAVID SILLITO HAS FOUND 
A GLIMMER OF HOPE

MOMENT IN HIS CAREER 
PRICELESS PICTURES AREN'T THEY AN AN APPEAL HAS BEEN LAUNCHED FOR THE 
VICTIMS OF THE BURMA CYCLONE 
IT IS FEARED THAT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MAY HAVE 
DIED IN THE DISASTER BURMA SAYS IT 
WILL IT WILL ACCEPT AID BUT 
DOESN'T WANT FOREIGN WORKERS TO 
DISTRIBUTE IT 
OUR CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE 
NOW CAN YOU GIVE US THE SITUATION 
AS YOU SEE IT 
I'M IN THE IRRAWADDY 
DELTA WHAT IS BECOMING CLEAR IT 
WASN'T THE CYCLONE THAT TOOK MOST 
OF THE LIVES IT RIPPED UP HOMES 
AND DESTROYED TREES AND DESTROYED 
THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHAT TOOK THE 
LIVES WAS THE TIDAL SURGE THAT 
WASHED INTO THE WESTERN PART OF THE 
DELTA AND TOOK AWAY COMMUNITIES OF 
TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE AT A TIME THESE 
PEOPLE WERE LIVING ALONG THE 
STREAMS AND RIVERS THAT MAKE UP 
THAT PART OF THE DELTA THEY ARE 
THE ONES THAT TOOK THE BRUN OF THIS 
AND THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE THE ONES 
LIVING NOW SURROUNDED BY THE 
CORPSES OF THOSE PERISHED 
WHAT AID DO YOU SEE COMING INTO THE 
COUNTRY 
WE DROVE TO A TOWN WHERE COUNTRY THE ARMY WHAT SET UP A STAGING POST 
TO START SHIPPING OUT THE RELIEF 
AID THEY HAVE ON TO SMALL BOATS AND 
TAKE IT INTO THE FLOODED AREAS WE 
HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE OF 
THE ARMY INVOLVED IN THE THE RELIEF 
EFFORT BUT IT IS NOWHERE NEAR 
ENOUGH THIS IS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM 
AND ANY GOVERNMENT WOULD STRUGGLE 
WITH IT BUT THIS ONE DOESN'T HAVE 
THE RESOURCES IT DOESN'T HAVE THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THERE ARE PEOPLE 
PEOPLE LOCKED OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE 
WORLD THAT ARE GOING TO DIE UNLESS 
THE BORDERS OPEN UP TO ALL THAT AID 
AND EXPERTISE THAT'S SITTING 
OUTSIDE OUTSIDE PAUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
LISTEN TO THAT IS THE INTERNATIONAL 
DIRECTOR OF THE BRITISH RED CROSS 
PART OF THE DISASTER DISASTER 
EMERGENCIES COMMITTEE WHICH 
LAUNCHED ITS APPEAL FOR HELP AND 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE 
THE RESOURCES IT DOESN'T SEEM TO 
WANT TO ACCEPT THE HELP WHAT 
PROBLEMS PRACTICAL PROBLEMS ARE 
YOU FACING 
WELL IT IS BY NOW WIDELY KNOWN I 
THINK THAT ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES 
IS GETTING VISAS FOR EX PATTRY AT 
PERSONNEL WHO ARE EXPERTS WHO NEED 
TO COME IN THE PICTURE IS AM IS AM 
BIGOUS AND WE HAVE TEN AID WORKERS 
IN THE COUNTRY FOUR WHO ARRIVED 
AFTER THE DISASTER AND SIX WHO WERE 
IN THE COUNTRY THROUGH THE RED 
CROSS CHANNEL WE ARE GETTING 
PEOPLE IN L. WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS A 
TRICKLE WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE A 
FLOODMENT IT IS SLOW BUT WE ARE 
NOT GIVING UP HOPE HOPE YET THAT WE 
WILL BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING OVER 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
WE HAVE THIS AWFUL IMAGE OF THE AID 
EFFECTIVELY STOCK PILED ON THE 
BORDERS OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT 
ALLOWED IN 
ARE YOU WORRIED THAT THE IMPACT OF 
THAT IMAGES THOSE IMAGES WHICH WE 
ARE SEEING AND HEARING REPORTERS 
RECOUNT THAT IS GOING TO IMPACT ON 
PEOPLE WANTING TO GIVE MONEY TO 
YOUR CAMPAIGN 
YES THAT'S CLEARLY 
A WORRY THE LONGER THIS GOES ON 
IT IS A RACE AGAINST TIME BOTH IN 
COUNTRY OF OF COURSE FIRST OF ALL 
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SURVIVED 
BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF CAPTURING 
PEOPLES MINDS AND GENEROSITY 
HAVING SAID THAT LAST NIGHT AFTER 
WE LAUNCHED THE APPEAL WE GOT IN TWO 
MILLION WHICH SHOWS HOW 
FANTASTICALLY GENEROUS AND 
INTERESTED THE BRITISH PUBLIC IS IN 
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS SO AGAIN WE 
ARE NOT YET READY TO GIVE UP HOPE 
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO UNDER LIKE 
THAT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT 
LOCAL EFFORTS GOING ON WE HAVE FOR 
THE RED CROSS SEVENTEEN THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS 
THROUGH THE DISASTER AREA WE SAW 
ONE OF THEM IN THE REPORT NOW WITH 
THE RED CROSS T. SHIRT AND OTHER D. E. C. 
AGENCIES WORLD VISION HAS A 
SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE SAVE THE 
CHILDREN HAS REACHED SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
ALL OF THIS IS NOT NOT ENOUGH BUT 
IT IS A BEGINNING AND WE IT IS OUR 
JOB WE THINK TO BUILD ON THAT AND 
TO KEEP THE PRESSURE UP 
IF YOU WERE TO COMPARE THIS TO A 
SITUATION WHERE A GOVERNMENT WOULD 
LET YOU THROUGH IMMEDIATELY AND 
ACCEPT ALL OFFERS OF HELP FROM THE 
FIRST MOMENT WHAT WOULD YOU HOPE 
TO BE DOING RIGHT NOW THAT YOU 
CAN'T DO BECAUSE OF THE OBSTACLES 
TWO THINGS REALLY THE FIRST ONE IS 
ASSESSMENT ONE OF THE COMMODITIES 
IS SOLID INFORMATION WE DON'T 
REALLY KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE 
DIED HOW MANY ARE LEFT HOMELESS 
AND IN DIRE NEEDS AND WHAT THEIR 
EXACT NEEDS ARE THAT'S THE FIRST 
THING WE WOULD BE DOING SENDING OUT 
TEAMS TO PROPERLY ASSESS WHAT THE 
SITUATION IS 
THE SECOND THING IS LINKED TO THAT 
TO VERY QUICKLY PROVIDE RELIEF AND 
THEN THIRDLY WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE 
IS A TSUNAMI LIKE SITUATION AND 
PEOPLE HAVE REALLY LOST EVERYTHING 
PEOPLE WERE IMPOVERISHED AND WHAT 
WE WOULD START DOING NOW IS TO 
THINK NOT JUST OF IMMEDIATE RELIEF 
BUT MEDIUM TERM RECOVERY 
TRANSITIONAL SHELTER PEOPLE HAVE 
LOST THEIR HOMES WHERE WOULD YOU 
PUT THEM FOR THE PERIOD UNTIL THEY 
CAN RECOVER THEIR LIVELIHOODS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
IF YOU HAVE GOT ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IF YOU ARE 
RELUCTANT TO GIVE AND HAVE THOUGHTS 
ON THAT LET US KNOW THE NUMBERS 
SHOULD BE ON THE SCREEN 
YOU'RE WATCHING BREAKFAST WE HAVE 
SEEN HIM SWEAR AT COUNTLESS 
CELEBRITIES WHO THINK THEY ARE 
STUFF IN THE KITCHEN NOW GORDON 
RAMSAY IS FOCUSING HIS ANGER CLOSER 
TO HOME 
HE IS CALLING FOR NEW LAWS TO BAN 
BRITISH CHEFS FOR PUTTING OUT OF 
SEASON FRUIT AND VEGETABLE ON THEIR 
TABLES TABLES GORDON RAMSAY IS FAMOUS FOR HIS BAD 
TEMPER AND NOW THERE IS SOMETHING 
ELSE MAKING HIM ANGRY HE TOLD ME 
THAT HE BELIEVES IT SHOULD BE MADE 
ILLEGAL FOR OUT OF SEASON VEGETABLE 
TO BE SERVED IN BRITISH RESTAURANTS 
FRUIT AND VEG SHOULD BE SEASONAL 
CHEFS SHOULD BE FINED IF THEY 
HAVEN'T GOT INGREEDANTS IN SEASON 
ON THEIR MENU L. DON'T WANT TO SEE 
ASPARAGUS IN THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER 
I DON'T WANT TO SEE STRAWBERRIES 
FROM KENYA IN MARCH I WANT TO SEE 
IT HOME GROWN THERE SHOULD BE LAWS 
FINED YOU KNOW LICENSING LAWS TO 
MAKE SURE THIS PRODUCE IS ONLY USED 
IN SEASON AND SEASON ONLY AND THE 
QUICKER WE GET THAT LEGISLATION 
PUSHED THROUGH THE HOUSES OF 
PARLIAMENT THE MORE UNIQUE THIS 
COUNTRY WILL BECOME IN TERMS OF ITS 
SOURCING ITS LEVEL OF INSPIRATION 
AND UNDERSTANDING THE SEASONAL 
ASPECTS WHICH MAKES IT MORE 
EXCITING FOR PUNTERS 
YES 
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING 
CAUSING HIM TO LOSE HIS TEMPER HE 
IS FURIOUS ABOUT ANOTHER T. V. CHEFS 
SERIES ON B. B. C. TWO 
DELIA SMITH AND HER CANNED FOODS 
WHAT HAVE YOU MADE OF THAT WITH WITH DELIA I'M FRUSTRATED BECAUSE IT IS 
A KICK IN THE GHOULIES FOR THE 
NATION I WOULD EXPECT STUDENTS 
STRUGGLING ON FIFTEEN OR TWENTY A WEEK TO 
SURVIVE EATING FROM A CAN BUT THE 
NATION'S FAVOURITE ALL TIME ICON 
REDUCING US DOWN TO YOU KNOW USING 
FROZEN FOOD CANNED FOOD NOW THAT 
HURTS SO IT IS APPALLING IT IS IT 
IS FRUSTRATING AND I THINK SHE 
SHOULD RE THINK HER POSITION AND 
MAYBE YOU KNOW RECONSIDER AND GET 
BACK TO THE REALLY NICE SAFE METHOD 
DOMESTIC EXCITING GOOD COOKING 
THAT SHE WAS DOING FOR THIRTY YEARS 
MY CAUSE IS SIMMERING AWAY 
AND HE IS ANNOYED AT HIMSELF HIS 
SHOW THE F. WORD RETURNS NEXT WEEK 
AND HE ADMITS THAT THE SWEARING IN 
IT DOES GET HIM INTO TROUBLE

AN EAR BASHING FROM MY MOTHER 
BECAUSE SHE IS PUSHING HER TROLLEY 
THROUGH THE SUPERMARKET AND HER 
FRIENDS COME UP AND SAY I SAW YOUR 
SON LAST NIGHT AND THAT WASN'T

SAIL SOUTH OF IS THAT I ESCAPED TO 
AVOID PROBLEMS WITH ICEBERGS IF

WELLS AGAIN CLOUDY WITH SHOWERY 
RAIN A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD IN THE 
SOUTH WEST WE'LL ALSO HAVE SOME 
MIST AND FOG CLOSE TO THE COAST OF 
WALES IN THE SOUTH WEST WHICH 
COULD LINGER FOR THE REST OF THE 
DAY AS THE CLOUD PUSHES NORTH EAST 
IT WILL ERADICATE THAT AREA OF 
BRIGHT AS ACROSS THE NORTH EAST OF 
ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND BEHIND IT IT

HARBOUR THERE IS A BIG CELEBRATION 
THIS WEEKEND UNTIL THEY KICK OFF 
WITH THE RACE ON SUNDAY FANTASTIC FANTASTIC BOAT BEHIND HER 
SHE WAS PLAGUED BY A HELICOPTER 
FROM WEDNESDAY NOW IT IS A HOOT 
THAT LET'S GO TO THE STOCK 
EXCHANGE EXCHANGE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ENERGY AND 
POWER IN DECEMBER THE GOVERNMENT 
SAID IT WANTED TO SEE THOUSANDS OF 
WIND TURBINES ALL ROUND THE COAST 
GENERATING ELECTRICITY AND POWER 
IN FACT GENERATING A THIRD OF OUR 
ELECTRICITY UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S 
EXPANSION PLANS COULD NOW BE IN 
DOUBT THE BUILDER OF THE BIGGEST 
OFFSHORE WIND TURBINE FARM 
CENTRICA SAY THAT IT COSTS 
CONTINUE TO RISE AS THEY ARE DOING 
FUTURE PROJECTS MAY NOT BE BORROWED 
VIABLE WE SEND OUR REPORTER JUST 
OFF THE COAST OF SKEGNESS 
BRITAIN'S COAST RUGGED AND 
BEAUTIFUL COULD IT ALSO BE THE 
ANSWER TO OUR FUTURE ENERGY NEEDS 
OFF THE COAST OF LINCOLNSHIRE THEY 
ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT THIS IS THE 
WORLD'S BIGGEST OFFSHORE WIND FARM 
ONE OF A HANDFUL DOTTED AROUND THE 
U. K. THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO SEE UP TO 
SEVEN THOUSAND TURBINES ENOUGH TO POWER ALL 
OF OUR HOMES BUT UPSHAW WIND 
ENERGY ISN'T CHEAP IT IS THREE 
TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD ONE 
OF THESE WIND FARMS THAN A 
CONVENTIONAL POWER STATION AND THE 
COSTS OF BUILDING ARE ESCALATING 
NOW THERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTION 
MARKS OVER WHETHER THIS REALLY IS 
THE FUTURE OF GREEN RENEWABLE 
ENERGY LAST WEEK SHELL ANNOUNCED 
A MAJOR PROJECT AT ORIGINALLY 
COSTED AT ONE BILLION THE COST HAD 
DOUBLED THESE HUGE BOATS ARE USED 
TO BUILD THE STATIONS OF SURE THE 
COST OF STEEL IS SOARING AND THEN 
A RATHER TURBINES THEMSELVES YOU YOU HAVE TO BUY THE TURBINES AND THE 
KIT THERE ARE JUST TWO 
MANUFACTURERS EVERYBODY IS TRYING 
TO BUY WIND HENCE IT IS 
PHENOMENALLY EXPENSIVE THERE IS A 
HUGE SUPPLY AND DEMAND A SHARE THE 
GOVERNMENT BLITHELY ASSUMES THAT 
THE COSTS WILL BE GOING DOWN 
INSTEAD THEY ARE GOING UP SOME SOME CLAIM THE SUPPLY PROBLEMS WOULDN'T 
EXIST IF THE GOVERNMENT HAD BACKED 
WIND POWER EARLIER NOW MAJOR 
PLAYERS ARE WARNING THAT RISING 
COSTS COULD SCUPPER THE 
GOVERNMENT'S PLANS ALTOGETHER THE THE FACTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS SLOW 
TO WAKE UP TO THE IDEA OF WINTER 
DID PUSH UP UNCERTAINTY AND THAT 
HAS AFFECTED PRICES THE IDEA OF 
WIND 
THE WORRYING TREND IS IF WIND COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE AND PROJECTS 
BECOME ABSOLUTELY AND ECONOMIC 
THEN THE TARGET OF BUILDING THIRTY THREE 
GIGAWATT OF OFFSHORE WIND IS UNDER 
THREAT 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE U. K. THREAT WILL BECOME THE LEADING COUNTRY FOR 
OFFSHORE WIND FACT THIS YEAR 
LET'S TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THE F. T. S. E.

WORKERS ARE GATHERING AND AID IS 
PILING UP 
OFFERS OF HELP FROM U. S. AND FRENCH 
NAVAL VESSELS ARE BEING IGNORED 
FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN A 
SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE OF THE ARMY 
INVOLVED IN THIS RELIEF EFFORT BUT 
IT REALLY IS NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH 
THIS IS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM AND ANY 
GOVERNMENT WOULD STRUGGLE WITH IT 
BUT THIS ONE DOESN'T HAVE THE 
RESOURCES OR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
THERE ARE PEOPLE LOCKED OFF FROM 
THE OUTSIDE WORLD THAT ARE GOING TO 
DIE UNLESS THE BORDERS OPEN UP TO 
ALL THAT AID AND EXPERTISE THAT'S 
SITTING OUTSIDE 
IT IS A NEGATIVE PICTURE BUT THOSE 
HOPING TO SECURE DONATIONS SAY THEY 
ARE NOT GIVING UP HOPE ON REACHING 
THOSE IN NEED 
LAST NIGHT AFTER WE LAUNCHED THE 
D. E. C. APPEAL WE GOT IN TWO MILLION 
WHICH SHOWS HOW FANTASTICALLY 
GENEROUS AND INTERESTED THE BRITISH 
PUBLIC IS IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS 
SO AGAIN WE ARE NOT YET READY TO 
GIVE UP HOPE L. WOULD ALSO LIKE TO 
UNDERLINE THAT THERE ARE 
SIGNIFICANT LOCAL EFFORTS GOING ON 
AND ALREADY IT SEEMS THEY ARE 
MAKING DIFFERENCE SAVE THE 
CHILDREN SAYS IT REACHED SIXTY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE WITH FOOD WATER AND SHELTER 
AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL TEAM FROM 
MERYL LIN ARRIVED IT WILL USE 
RIVER CRUISER TO REACH THE STRANDED 
AND THE BRITISH RED CROSS SAYS A 
FLIGHT OF GERRY CANS AND SHELTER 
KITS HAS ARRIVED WITH ANOTHER DUE 
TODAY TODAY BUT THERE ARE WARNINGS THAT ANY 
EFFECTIVE RELIEF EFFORT WILL NEED 
FAR MORE AID THAN THIS 
CHILDREN WHO STILL STRUGGLE TO READ 
BY THE AGE OF SIX ARE OVERTAKING 
THEIR CLASS AFTER A FEW HOURS OF 
SPECIALIST ONE TO ONE TEACHING 
THE GOVERNMENT SCHEME HAS BEEN SO 
SUCCESSFUL IT WILL BE ROLLED OUT TO 
ALL PRIMARY SCHOOLS IN THE AUTUMN 
TERM TERM BEN IS 
STRUGGLING TO READ 
SHOCKINGLY SIX OUT OF EVERY ONE HUNDRED 
CHILDREN NEVER LEARN PROPERLY AND 
LEAVE SCHOOL BARELY LITERATE BUT 
THAT WON'T HAPPEN TO HELEN SHE AND 
OTHERS OTHERS AT THIS SCHOOL 
BENEFIT FROM INTENSIVE ONE TO ONE 
TUITION HALF AN HOUR A DAY FOR SIX 
MONTHS AND IT IS SHOWING DRAMATIC 
RESULTS RESULTS IT IS HARD BECAUSE I CAN'T READ THE 
WORDS PROPERLY 
AND NOW IS IT 
GETTING EASIER YES YES RESEARCH BY THE INSTITUTE FOR 
EDUCATION FOUND THE APPROACH CALLED 
READING RECOVERY BROUGHT THE WORST 
IN THE CLASS UP TO ABOVE AVERAGE 
IT 
IS EXPENSIVE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PUPIL SO IS IT WORTH IT 
I KNOW CLEARLY FROM 
THE WAY SCHOOLS OPERATE THAT IF 
YOU DON'T ADDRESS ISSUES IN THE 
EARLY YEARS IN KEY STAGE ONE LATER 
ON YOU GET TRIPLE THE PROBLEMS AND 
DOUBLE THE COST YES READING 
RECOVERY IS EXPENSIVE BUT IT IS 
WORTH IT 
THE GOVERNMENT IS IMPRESSED AND 
PROMISED TO ROLL OUT THE SCHEME 
ACROSS ENGLAND OVER THE NEXT THREE 
YEARS IF READING REROVERRY IS 
EFFECTIVE IT RAISES QUESTIONS THE 
SYSTEM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG 
TIME WHY WASN'T IT INTRODUCED 
YEARS AGO IF IT HAD BEEN HOW MANY 
CHILDREN'S LIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN 
TRANSFORMED 
THE AUSTRIAN MAN WHO IMPRISONON HIS 
DAUGHTER FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS IS EXPECTED 
TO APPEAR IN COURT TODAY A JUDGE 
WILL DECIDE WHETHER JOSEF FRITZL 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE REMANDED IN 
KUS TODAY GRI AS CUSTODY AS THE 
INVESTIGATION CONTINUES 
HOME OWNERS STRUGGLING WITH THEIR 
MORTGAGE PAYMENTS DURING THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH ARE TO GET FREE LEGAL AID TO 
AVOID LOSING THEIR HEEMS THE 
HOUSING MINISTER SAID THE MOVE WILL 
HELP FAMILIES AT AT RISK OF 
REPOSSESSION MORE SUPPORT WILL BE 
GIVEN FOR ORGANISATIONS PROVIDING 
DEBT ADVICE 
THE CELEBRITY CHEF GORDON RAMSAY 
SAYS BRITISH RESTAURANTS SHOULD BE 
BANNED FROM SERVING FRUIT AND 
VEGETABLES WHICH AREN'T IN SEASON 
SPEAKING TO B. B. C. NEWS HE SAYS THE 
MOVE WOULD HELP THE ENVIRONMENT BY 
CUTTING DOWN ON FOODS THERE 
TRANSPORTED AROUND THE WORLD HE 
SAID IT WOULD FORCE CHEF TO SAY 
COME UP WITH BETTER FORCE CHEF 
TO SAY COME UP WITH BETTER IDEAS 
THERE SHOULD BE LAWS TO ENSURE THIS 
PRODUCE IS ONLY USED IN SEASON AND 
IN SEASON ONLY THE QUICKER WE GET 
THE LEGISLATION PUSHED THROUGH THE 
HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT THE MORE 
UNIQUE THIS COUNTRY WILL BECOME 
THE PLANNED OVERHAUL IN THE N. H. S. IN 
ENGLAND WILL BENEFIT PATIENTS AND 
STAFF LORD DARZI WHO IS LEADING 
REVIEW OF THE HEALTH SERVICE 
PLEDGED ANY DECISIONS WILL BE MADE 
AT A LOCAL LEVEL CRITICS SAY THE 
CHANGES WILL LEAD TO THE CLOSURE OF 
OF HOSPITAL DEPARTMENTS AND THE 
UNDERMINING OF LOCAL G. P. SURGERIES 
REUBEN HAD A FIT A FEW YEARS AGO 
THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT SEVERAL DAYS 
IN HOSPITAL BUT HE HAS BEEN 
BROUGHT TO THIS SPECIAL UNIT WHICH 
WILL TREAT HIM AND LET HIM GO HOME 
AND CALL HIM BACK FOR MORE 
TREATMENT IF HE NEEDS IT KIDS 
RECOVER BETTER AT HOME AND IT IS 
LESS STRESS FOR THE FAMILY 
WHAT THEY ARE DOING HERE IS TRYING 
TO MAKE CHILDREN'S JOURNEYS THROUGH 
THE N. H. S. SIMPLER IT IS THE KIND OF 
THING THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT EACH 
REGIONS PRODUCING ITS OWN SET OF 
REFORMS SUGGESTED BY STAFF AND 
PATIENTS RATHER THAN BEING IMPOSED 
FROM ABOVE THE MAN LEADING THE 
REVIEW IS LORD DARZI HEALTH 
MINISTER AND SURGEON THE 
GOVERNMENT IS KEEN TO EMPHASISE HIS 
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE HEALTH 
SERVICE SERVICE SO WILL THESE CHANGES MEAN 
DIFFERENT PRIORITIES IN DIFFERENT 
AREAS MORE OF A POSTCODE LOTTERY 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES AND 
THAT IS A REFLECTION OF THE 
CHANGING NATURE OF MEDICINE AND 
THAT IS WHY THIS REVIEW WILL ALLOW 
AT A LOCAL LEVEL FOR PEOPLE TO 
APPRAISE WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE 
AND DEAL WITH THESE PRIORITIES IN 
THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE WAY 
CRITICS SAY THE REAL AGENDA IS 
GETTING RID OF SMALL G. P. PRACTISES 
AND REPLACING THEM WITH BIG NEW 
HEALTH CENTRES LIKE THIS ONE AND 
THAT THE N. H. S. HAS SEEN TOO MUCH 
CHANGE ALREADY 
DESPITE CONCERNS ABOUT FALLING 
HOUSE PRICES WOODEN BEACH HUT ON 
THE SUFFOLK COAST IS EXPECTED TO 
SELL FOR OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND ESTATE 
AGENTS SAY THE PRICE REFLECTS THE 
HIGH DEMAND FOR PROPERTIES IN THE 
AREA THE PROPERTY IS IN SOUTHWOLD 
IT IS ONE ROOM BUT COMES COMPLETE 
WITH LOUNGING CHAIRS AND A 
WINDBREAK WINDBREAK IT IS A LOT OF MONEY BUT OBVIOUSLY 
THEY ARE IN GREATS DEMAND 
AND NICE SPOT 
A LOVELY PART OF THE COAST 
WE KNOW ABOUT HOLDING PARTIES TO 
SELL SELL TUPPERWARE HOW ABOUT 
STUN GUNS WE WILL BRING AWE REPORT 
FROM AMERICA ABOUT THE NEW TREND 
FOR TASER PARTIES YES YOU HEARD 
THAT RIGHT 
THE THINGS YOU SHOOT AT PEOPLE AND 
GIVE THEM A SHOCK 
DO THAT AGAIN 
MORE ON THAT LATER 
PASSING YOUR 
DRIVING TEST WHEN YOU ARE SEVENTEEN IS ONE 
THING WHAT ABOUT TAKING IT AGAIN 
WHEN YOU ARE SEVEN OH SEVEN 
OLD SEVENTY 
OLDER DRIVERS ARE BEING ENCOURAGED 
TO TAKE A TEST TO MAKE SURE THEY 
ARE FIT TO GET BEHIND THE THE WHEEL 
MIKE CARTWRIGHT IS IS AT A TEST 
CENTRE CENTRE GOOD MORNING THERE IS HALF A DOZEN 
SENIOR CITIZENS HAVING THEIR EYE 
TESTS AND DOING OTHER TESTS THE 
REST OUT ON THE ROAD BRUSHING UP ON 
THEIR DRIVING SKILLS THEY MAKE UP 
OVER FIVE MILLION SENIOR CITIZENS 
WITH DRIVING LICENCES ON THE ROADS 
AND HERE IN SUFFOLK THEY ARE JUST 
ASKING THE QUESTION ARE OLDER 
DRIVERS MORE VULNERABLE ON THE 
ROADS AND THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE SET 
UP THE COURSE YESTERDAY WE WENT 
OUT AND JOINED MAUREEN AS SHE WAS 
ASSESSED ON THE ROAD 
I WANT YOU TO GO TO THE RIGHT AT 
THE END OF THE ROAD 
AGED SIXTY NINE MAUREEN DROVE FOR THIRTY NINE YEARS 
WITHOUT AN ACCIDENT BUT HER CAR 
AND HER CONFIDENCE TOOK A KNOCK 
AFTER SOMEONE DROVE INTO THE BACK 
OF HER THAT'S WHY SHE JOINED THE 
COURSE COURSE MY CHILDREN CHILDREN THINK I'M A 
TERRIBLE DRIVER 
WHY IS THAT NO IDEA 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR SPEED THIS IS THE 
NATIONAL SPEED LIMIT WOULD YOU GO 
AT THEM 
I USUALLY KEEP AT SIXTY M. P. H. 
WHAT ABOUT DUAL CARRIAGEWAY WHAT 
WOULD YOU DO ON THAT 
ZERO SIX M. P. H. OR 
SIXTY FIVE M. P. H. SIXTY FIVE M. P. H. AFTER A FEW YEARS YOU FEEL IN A 
RUT YOU FEEL CONFIDENT TO HAVE 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HELPS YOU TO 
FIND WHERE THE PROBLEM AREAS ARE 
THE DRIVING INSTRUCTOR SAYS HE HAS 
SEEN HOW ACCIDENTS HAPPEN 
USUALLY WHEN THEY COME TO UNUSUAL 
JUNCTIONS PLACES THEY ARE NOT USED 
TO THEY MAY HAVE COME ACROSS A 
DIVERSION AND ENDED UP SOMEWHERE 
THEY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH AND 
ENDED UP ON THE WRONG ROAD 
LIKE THIS ELDERLY COUPLE WHO TURNED 
THE WRONG WAY UP A DUAL CARRIAGEWAY 
THE ONCOMING CAR HAD TO STOP AND 
BEFORE THEY STOPPED AND TURNED 
AROUND AND CARRIED ON 
IT IS A COMPLEX ACTIVITY AND YOU 
ARE REQUIRED TO DO A LOT OF 
THINKING QUICKLY ESPECIALLY AT 
SPEED AND IF IF COME ACROSS A NEW 
SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE GOT TO 
REACT QUICKLY AS YOU GET OLDER THAT 
TAKES A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND 
SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT MAKE A MISTAKE 
MAUREEN SAYS SHE HAS BECOME 
BETTER DRIVER WITH AGE THIS IS HER 
MESSAGE MESSAGE YOUNG ONES CONTINUE TO PUT THE FOOT 
DOWN THEY ARE GOING TO BE MY AGE 
ONE DAY AND THEN THEY WILL PERHAPS 
HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR THE ROAD AND 
PEOPLE ON IT 
OF COURSE IF THEY FAIL THE COURSE 
WELL IT IS UP TO THEM TO DECIDE 
WHAT TO DO THIS COURSE HASN'T ANY 
LEGAL TEETH THIS IS AN EYE TEST 
GOING ON HERE AS LONG AS YOU CAN 
SEE TWO HUNDRED FIVE METERS OR SIXTY SEVEN FEET WITH OR 
WITHOUT YOUR GLASSES YOU ARE T. TO DRIVE DRIVE THIS GOES ON THE STEERING WHEEL IT 
HELPS PEOPLE GET MORE MAN MANOUVERABILITY A. N. N. IS ON THE COURSE DOES ANY OF 
THIS STUFF APPEAL TO YOU THE THE MIRRORS FOR THE BLIND SPOTS APPEAL 
TO ME THOSE MIRRORS WOULD COME IN 
HANDY HANDY WHY DID YOU JOIN THE COURSE DO YOU 
CONSIDER YOURSELF A BAD DRIVER I I FEEL CONFIDENT BUT I NEED ANOTHER 
OPINION AS TO HOW BADLY OR GOOD I 
AM DOING AN ASSESSMENT IS A GOOD 
IDEA IDEA GOOD LUCK WE WILL FIND OUT HOW YOU 
DO LATER 
TWENTY PER CENT OLDER PEOPLE MAKE UP TWENTY PER CENT OF 
THE DRIVERS ON THE ROAD BUT MAKE 
UP TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE FATALITIES 
JOINING US NOW IS MICHELLE L. KNOW 
YOU HELP PUT THE COURSE TOGETHER 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE 
THE PEOPLE ARE DOING A COGNITIVE 
TRAIL TEST WAS STOPPED WE HAVE TO 
USE VISUAL PATTERNS WHERE WE ARE 
DRIVING AND IT LOOKS LIKE I 
LOOKS AT SIMILAR SKILLS 
IS IT NOT 
YOUNG DRIVERS WHO CAUSE ALL THE 
PROBLEMS ON THE ROADS 
STATISTICALLY YOUNGER DRIVERS DO 
CAUSE MOST OF THE ACCIDENTS WE DO 
HAVE COURSES FOR YOUNGER DRIVERS 
BUT OLDER DRIVERS IS JUST ANOTHER 
AREA THAT WE HELP IF WE CAN REDUCE 
CASUALTIES THAT WILL BE FANTASTIC 
SUFFOLK IS VERY RURAL THE 
TRANSPORT LINKS ARE NOT ALWAYS THAT 
FANTASTIC IF WE CAN KEEP PEOPLE ON 
THE ROAD FOR LONGER THAT WILL BE 
GOOD THE CAKE THANK YOU LOTS OF E. MAILS ON HAS ALREADY 
TONY FROM GRANTHAM SAYS DON'T 
BECOME THE ELDERLY PEOPLE YOUNG 
PEOPLE DRIVE THROUGH MY VILLAGE AND 
SEVENTY M. P. H. 
ONE VIEWER SAYS IT THAT THEY THINK 
THESE TESTS ARE A GOOD IDEA AS IS 
SET A RE TEST THEIR EVERYBODY 
IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS LET'S KNOW 
EVERYBODY THINKS THEY ARE A GOOD 
DRIVER DID THEY 
YES BUT A LIGHT THE THERE THAT IS 
SIMPLY AN ASSESSMENT AND ADVICE 
GIVING SCHEME IF YOU FIND THAT YOU 
ARE NOT A GOOD DRIVER YOU CAN 
STILL DRIVE AWAY LET'S LOOK AT THE 
PAPERS THE TELEVISION PHONE IN 
SCANDAL TWO DEVASTATING REPORTS 
INTO I. T. V. 
THE TIMES PICKS UP ON THAT ANT AND 
DEC GOT THE AWARD AND IT SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN CATHERINE TATE SHE 
HASN'T COMMENTED HERSELF THE TIMES 
ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT PROBLEMS ON 
THE ROADS CONGESTION GETTING WORSE 
PARTICULARLY ON MOTORWAYS 
THE SUN HAS NEW ALLEGATIONS FROM 
AUSTRIA JOSEF FRITZL CLAIMS THAT 
GROWING UP UNDER THE NAZIS TURNED 
HIM INTO THE MAN HE BECAME 
AND ON THE DAILY TELEGRAPH ONE OF 
MANY HARROWING IMAGES COMING OUT OF 
BURMA MANY PEOPLE MAKING THE POINT 
THAT THEY ARE SUFFERING FROM THINGS 
WHICH COULD EASILY BE HELPED 
THINGS LIKE DIARRHOEA AND THINGS TO 
DO WITH THE QUALITY OF THE WATER 
THEY HELP IS GRADUALLY TRICKLING IN 
BUT A LOT OF ANGER ABOUT IT 
COMING UP LATER 
A SHOCKING STORY FROM AMERICA HOW 
PERSONAL PROTECTION FEARS ARE 
MAKING PARTY PLANNERS SWITCH FROM 
TUPPERWARE TO TASERS 
AND AT A GUITARS AT THE READY 
ROCK LEGENDS DEF LEPPARD WILL BE ON 
THE SOFA 
YOU WOULD THINK HE WOULD BE A BIT 
EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR ROCKERS 
MAYBE THEY HAVE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT 
THEY HAVE CHANGED ENTIRELY SEVERAL 
OF THEM ARE VEGETARIANS 
CAROL IS IN PLYMOUTH THIS MORNING 
ONE OF THE WORLD'S TOUGHEST YACHT 
RACES IS ABOUT TO BEGIN THERE 
THE ANSWER RIGHT IT TAKES PLACE ON 
SUNDAY IT KICKS OFF AT TWO P. M. IT IS 
THE FIRST OCEANIC YACHT RACE IN THE 
WORLD IT STARTED IN NINETEEN SIXTY AND IN 
THOSE DAYS IT TOOK ABOUT FORTY ONE DAYS 
TO TRAVEL FROM PLYMOUTH TO BOSTON 
TODAY WE EXPECTED TO TAKE BETWEEN 
TEN AND TWELVE DAYS EVERYBODY SALES UP 
SINGLE HANDEDLY ELLEN MACARTHUR 
WON THEIRS IN TWO THOUSAND THE WEAR THEM 
PLYMOUTH IS FAIRLY CLOUDY THERE IS 
A GENTLE BREEZE THE WEATHER IN 
PLYMOUTH MANY OF US ARE LOOKING AT 
MORE CLOUD THAN WE HAVE BEEN USED 
TO BUT A PLEASANT DAY AND WARM 
BUT THE CLOUD COULD BE THICK ENOUGH 
TO PRODUCE SOME SHOWERY OUTBREAKS 
FIRST THING THIS MORNING YOU CAN 
SEE WHETHER CLOUD HAS BEEN IT IS 
MOVING EASTWARDS AND TAKING THE 
SHOWERY RAIN WITH IT NOT ALL OF US 
WILL SEE THAT RAIN THE SOUTH EAST 
AT NINE A M. CONTINUING WITH SOME LOVELY 
SUNSHINE HAZY AT TIMES BECAUSE OF 
A HIGH CLOUD AS WE PUSH NORTH INTO 
THE NORTH OF ENGLAND A FAIRLY 
CLOUDY START WITH SOME SHOWERS 
ESPECIALLY BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY TO 
THE WEST OF THE PENNINES THE 
NORTH EAST AND EASTERN AND NORTHERN 
SCOTLAND WAS SEE SOME SUNSHINE IN 
THE WEST AND SOUTH WEST OF SCOTLAND 
THICKER CLOUD AND SHOWERS AND 
SHOWERY OUTBREAKS ACROSS NORTHERN 
IRELAND THAT RAIN EXTENDS ACROSS 
THE IRISH SEA INTO WALES IN THE 
SOUTH WEST BUT THE RAIN ISN'T TOO 
SIGNIFICANT MORE SHOWERY AND 
PATCHY IN NATURE BUT SOMETHING 
YOU'LL NOTICE IF YOU ARE CLOSE TO 
THE COAST IN WALES AND THE SOUTH 
WEST THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF MIST 
AND FOG SOME OF THAT WILL LAST 
THROUGH THE DAY ESPECIALLY ON THE 
HEADLANDS THE RAIN PUSHES NORTH 
EAST WITH BRIGHTER SKY BEHIND THEM 
TOP TEMPERATURES AROUND TWENTY SEVEN DEGREES 
CELSIUS FIRST OF THE SHOWERS DIE 
AWAY MOSTLY OVERNIGHT FOR STILL 
MORE CLOUD ACROSS SCOTLAND SO NOT 
AS COLD HERE AS IT HAS BEEN 
TOMORROW AGAIN A LOT OF SUNSHINE 
ON OFFER BUT STILL SOME SHOWERS 
BUBBLING UP THROUGH THE DAY TWENTY EIGHT 
DEGREES CELSIUS IS AT EIGHTY TWO FAHRENHEIT 
THE AVERAGE THIS SUMMER VIA LONDON 
WOULD NORMALLY BE ABOUT SIXTEEN ON 
SUNDAY SHOWERY OUTBREAKS ACROSS 
PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND SOUTHERN 
SCOTLAND AND THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
BUT FOR THE REST OF THE BRITISH 
ISLES BASED IN BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINE 
AND TEMPERATURES ARE UNSEASONABLY 
HIGH HIGH LET'S GO BACK TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE 
GOOD MORNING UNFORTUNATELY MORE 
GLOOM FOR HOUSE OWNERS THIS IS OFF 
ONE OF THE STORIES YOU HAVE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT 
OFFERING LEGAL ADVICE TO PEOPLE 
FACING REPOSSESSION LET'S HOPE 
THEY HAVE PLENTY OF LEGAL COUNSEL 
US OUT THERE BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES IS 
EXPECTED TO SOAR THAT IS WHAT WE 
EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THE CITIZENS' 
ADVICE BUREAU IT ESTIMATES THAT 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SEEKING 
REPOSSESSION WILL SKYROCKET TO 
FORTY FIVE THOUSAND YEAR AT THIS YEAR THAT IS 
UP FROM EIGHT THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
WE'LL ALSO FIND OUT LATER TODAY WHO 
IS INTERESTED IN BUYING THE 
GOVERNMENT'S THIRTY FIVE PER CENT STAKE IN BRITISH 
ENERGY THE DEADLINE FOR THE BIDS 
FOR THE U. K. NUCLEAR COMPANY IS TODAY 
BUT A BIDDING WAR SEEMS UNLIKELY 
WE HAVE SEEN A COUPLE OF POTENTIAL 
BIDDERS LIKE SUEZ AND EON RULE 
THEMSELVES OUT BUT WE CERTAINLY 
EXPECT TO HEAR FROM GERMANY'S R. W. E. 
AND FRANCE'S E. D. F. THEY ARE EXPECTED 
TO OFFER IN THE REGION OF SIX HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED 
PENCE PER SHARE 
AND THE FINANCIAL TIMES IS 
REPORTING THAT E. D. F. HAS A BACK UP 
PLAN IT IS STARTING TO BUY LAND 
NEXT TO THESE NUCLEAR PLANTS TO 
BUILD ITS OWN POWER STATIONS IF IT 
ISN'T SUCCESSFUL IN A BID FOR 
BRITISH ENERGY AND AT SEVEN FIFTY AM I 
WILL BE TALKING TO A COUPLE OF 
EXPERTS ABOUT THESE BEAUTIES A NEW 
STUDY HAS FOUND THAT IF YOU HAVE 
LOTS OF PLANTS IN YOUR OFFICE IT 
WILL MAKE YOU HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER 
THE STUDY ALSO SAID IT WORKERS CAN 
SEE LOTS OF PLANTS FROM THEIR DESK 
THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO TAKE SICK 
LEAVE THAT IS AT SEVEN FIFTY AM SEE YOU 
THEN THEN THEY ARE LOVELY WE COULD DO WITH A 
FEW PLANTS 
WE HAVE ALL HEARD OF TUPPERWARE 
PARTIES PARTIES TO SELL COSMETICS 
OR UNDERWEAR 
BUT IN AMERICA FEARS ABOUT 
PERSONAL PROTECTION HAVE LED TO THE 
GROWTH OF A NEW TYPE OF PARTY 
WHICH CRITICS ARE CALLING TRULY 
SHOCKING SHOCKING DENVER COLORADO IN A TRENDY 
DOWNTOWN APARTMENT THE PARTY IS IN 
FULL SWING STRICTLY NO ALCOHOL AND 
PROBABLY LIKE BUT UNLIKE ANY 
PARTY YOU OR I HAVE BEEN TOO THIS 
IS A TASER PARTY THINK TUPPERWARE 
MEETS PERSONAL PROTECTION THE 
GUESTS MAINLY WOMEN GET TO TRY IT 
OUT THEMSELVES GUESTS HERE 
STATISTICS WHICH MIGHT PERSUADE 
THEM THEY WILL NEED A TASER THERE THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN SEXUAL ASSAULTS IT IT COSTS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY YOU HAVE TO PASS 
A BAGRAM CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECKED 
SO SHE HAS STARTED PARTIES DANA 
SHAFMAN SAYS SALES ARE ROCKETING 
MY GOAL IS TO SAY THAT ONE PERSON 
PEOPLE THINK SHOULD I REALLY 
ATTACK THIS PERSON BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE A TASER IF THAT HAPPENS I 
HAVE DONE THE NATION SERVICE SHE SHE CLEARLY BELIEVES IN HER PRODUCT ON 
HER WEBSITE THERE IS A VIDEO OF 
HER BEING SHOT WITH A TASER PROOF 
SHE SAYS IT ISN'T HARMFUL BUT 
ALSO ON LINE ARE THINGS LIKE THIS 
A STUDENT IN FLORIDA WHO DISRUPTED 
A POLITICAL EVENT SOME PEOPLE ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT TASERS BEING MARKETED 
TO ORDINARY AMERICANS 
THE PROSPECT 
OF ORDINARY CONSUMERS PURCHASING 
THESE DEVICES WITHOUT FULLY KNOWING 
THE POTENTIAL DANGERS I THINK IS 
POTENTIALLY VERY BAD INDEED 
AMERICANS CHERISH THEIR RIGHT TO 
BEAR ARMS BUT FEW GET TO TRY A 
TASER L. HAVE GOT THE TASERS IT 
FEELS COMFORTABLE LIGHT AND AUNT 
THE CARTRIDGES IN SAW AND POINTING 
IT UPWARDS L. AM READY TO SHOOT IT 
CERTAINLY GIVE YOU QUITE SHOCK 
WHEN YOU FIRE IT FOR US TO BE DONE 
NOTHING MUCH RECOIL BUT NOW THERE 
ARE FIFTY THOUSAND VOLTS COURSING THROUGH 
MY POTENTIAL ATTACKER 
I AM NOT A 
DAMN PERSON THAT WERE TOTALLY 
FREAKED ME OUT THIS COULD BE A 
GOOD ALTERNATIVE 
IF IT WASN'T A 
PARTY ATMOSPHERE I PROBABLY 
WOULDN'T HAVE LEARNT ABOUT TASERS 
WITH COUNTRY WITH ABOUT ONE DOWN 
FOR EVERY ADULT THIS IS CLAIMED TO 
BE A LESS DANGEROUS ALTERNATIVE 
SOMETHING BIT UNSETTLING ABOUT 
THAT CYRIL THE DIPS D. D. C. THE

AND HE IS HE IS HOPING TO DO THAT 
AT THE TURK TURKISH GRAND PRIX 
THIS IS LEWIS FLYING ON TO A STAGE 
AS AT GREEK GOD APOLLO 
ARE YOU STILL WITH ME IT WAS HIS 
JOB AS PART OF A PROMOTION FOR ONE 
OF MCLAREN'S SPONSORS HE SEEMS A 
TINY BIT UNCOMFORTABLE AS WOULD 
MOST OF US BE BEING HOISTED UP 
WATCH THIS LITTLE WAVE 
IT IS ALMOST APOLOGETIC 
NORMALLY HE IS DIGNIFIED AND 
COMPOSED COMPOSED IT IS HARD TO BE DIGNIFIED AND 
COMPOSED WHEN YOU ARE BEING HOISTED 
UP OFF A STAGE LIKE THAT 
I'M SURE HE GOT PAID HANDSOMELY 
NOW HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN 
CHILDREN PLAYING ON BOUNCY CASTLES 
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT WHO IS 
RESPONSIBLE IF SOMETHING GOES 
WRONG SAM HARRIS WAS JUST ELEVEN 
AND PLAYING UNSUPERSIGHSED ON A 
BOUNCING CASTLE A A BIRTHDAY PARTY 
WHEN A KICK TO THE HEAD LED HIM 
BRAIN DAMAGED AND IN NEED OF 
CONSTANT CARE DOES THIS MEAN THE 
BOUNCING CASTLE IS A NO GO ZONE 
WHEN IT COMES TO THROWING 
CHILDREN'S PARTIES ROB WHEWAY IS A 
PLAY SAFETY ADVISOR AND AND JOANNA 
MOORHEAD MOORHEAD THE AMOUNT OF OF PARENTS WHO SAID 
THEY HAVE HAD A BOUNCING CASTLE AND 
NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT WHO MIGHT BE 
RESPONSIBLE IF GOES GOES WRONG 
JUST CLARIFY FOR US IF YOU CAN 
WHAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT 
WELL WE SHOULDN'T BE CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE NORMAL BUMPS AND SCRAPES 
OF CHILDHOOD EVERYBODY WHEN THEY 
CHILD WENT THROUGH THAT YOU 
GET THE TWISTS AND THE OCCASIONAL 
BROKEN BONE AND THAT HAPPENS AND 
WITHIN PLAY THE HEALTH AND SAFETY 
EXECUTIVE RECOGNISE THAT THAT 
HAPPENS BUT IF YOU HAVE GOT 
SOMETHING MORE CHALLENGING LIKE A 
BOUNCING CASTLE YOU NEED TO BE 
MORE CAREFUL 
CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT IF I AS A 
PARENT HIRE A A BOUNCING CASTLE FOR 
MY GARDEN AM I INSURED WHAT'S THE 
THE DEAL 
YOU MAYBE INSURED THROUGH 
YOUR CONTENTS 
WHY THE MAYBE 
NOT EVERYBODY HAS 
BUILDING CONTENTS PUBLIC LIBT 
LIBT 
IF YOU HAVE YOU ARE PROBABLY 
INSURED 
IF YOU HAD SOMETHING THAT INSURED WAS REALLY MASSIVELY EXCITING 
CHALLENGING OR DANGEROUS THE 
INSURANCE COMPANY MAY SAY NO THAT'S 
NOT COVERED NORMAL PLAY ACTIVITIES 
YOU WOULD BE COVERED 
DOES THIS SEND YOU SCUTTLING TO 
LOOK AT THE DETAILS OF YOUR 
INSURANCE POLICY 
YES A LOT OF 
PARENTS WILL BE CONCERNED ABOUT IT 
AREN'T THEY AND WORRIED ABOUT THE 
NEXT PARTY L. HAVE HEARD PARENTS 
OVER THE LAST DAY SINCE THIS CASE 
HAPPENED SAYING ARE WE GOING WE 
HAVE OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN AROUND 
TO PLAY GET THEM TO SIGN SOMETHING 
TO SAY THEY WON BE RESPONSIBLE AND 
THEY WON'T BE SUED 
WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE ONE OF 
THE BIG HEADLINE THINGS THAT'S 
GOING ON IN CHILDHOOD IS THAT 
CHILDREN ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH 
FREEDOM AND IF THIS RESTRICTS THEIR 
FREEDOM FURTHER THAT SEEMS TO ME TO 
BE A REALLY SAD THING 
THAT MUST BE THE INITIAL INSTINCT 
OF PARENTS ANYWAY OR LET'S CALM 
DOWN A BIT AND NOT HAVE SOMETHING 
THAT'S GOING TO BE AS EXCITING OR 
PHYSICAL 
NO IF MY CHILDREN WERE PHYSICAL STILL YOUNG I WOULD STILL THINK OF 
HIRING A BOUNCING CASTLE THE 
PEOPLE HIRING THEM OR SELLING THEM 
AREN'T GIVING THE CORRECT ADVICE 
AND WHAT PEOPLE NEED IS COMMON 
SENSE GOOD ADVICE L. WILL GIVE YOU 
AN EXAMPLE NO ONE WOULD THINK THAT 
WAS DANGEROUS BUT BEFORE CHILDREN 
GO ON A BOUNCING CASTLE YOU SHOULD 
TAKE THAT OUT OF YOUR POCKET IF 
YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POCKET IT 
DROPS OUT AND COULD STAB YOU 
ON THE HIRING ISSUE IF YOU GO TO 
HIRE BOUNCING CASTLE IS THERE ANY 
RESPONSIBLE ON THE PEOPLE WHO HIRE 
THEM OUT TO SAY CHECK YOUR 
INSURANCE OR WE WON'T HIRE IT TO 
YOU THEY HAND IT OVERKS OVER 
AND THERE IS NO RESPONSIBILITY 
THERE SHOULDN'T NEED TO BE AN 
EXTENSION ON YOUR INSURANCE WHAT 
THEY ARE FAILING TO DO IS GIVE 
ADEQUATE ADVICE TO THE NOT ALL OF 
THEM SOME ARE GIVING ADEQUATE 
ADVICE THERE ARE ISSUES THAT YOU 
MAY NOT THINK OF UNTIL AFTER THE 
ACCIDENT HAPPENED LIKE THE SHARP 
OBJECT IN YOUR POCKET THAT IS 
COMMON SENSE DON'T PUT IT NEXT TO 
THE GREENHOUSE WHERE IF A CHILD 
FALLS OUT THEY WILL CRASH INTO THE 
GRASS DON'T LET CHILDREN PUT A 
BICYCLE NEXT TO IT WHERE INSTEAD OF 
FALLING ON TO THE GRASS AND GETTING 
A BUMP YOU FALL ON A BICYCLE AND 
GET AN INJURY 
COMMON SENSE IS ALWAYS THE KEY IN 
ALL THESE THINGS ISN'T IT THE 
FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THESE 
THINGS ARE INCREDIBLY RARE IT IS 
JUST THAT AS PARENTS AND ADULTS WE 
ARE WORRIED 
ABSOLUTELY THE KEY THING IS THAT 
PARENTS ARE RISK ASSESSORS WE DO 
IT NATURALLY WE DO IT THE WHOLE 
TIME THIS AFTERNOON I WILL 
BEHAVING PICNIC WITH MY CHILDREN 
ON THE COMMON AND WHEN I GET THERE 
AND THE OTHER PARENTS WE WILL LOOK 
AROUND AND THINK WHAT ARE THE 
RISKS IT IS IMPORTANT TO TRUST 
THAT INSTINCTFOR OUR SOCIETY TO 
TRUST THAT INSTINCT AND FOR US TO 
TRUST ONE ANOTHER TO LOOK AFTER 
BECAUSE THAT EXTENDS TO THE 
CHILDREN IN OUR CARE AS IN THIS 
CASE THAT WE LOOK AFTER OUR OWN 
CHILDREN AND THE OTHERS AND THE SAD 
THING HERE IS THAT IN THE CULTURE 
WE LIVE IN THE ONLY WAY OF GETTING 
COMPENSATION FOR A CHILD WHO IS 
BADLY INJURED IS TO SUE AND THAT'S 
A SHAME THINK OUR GOVERNMENT 
SHOULD LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAY OF 
INSURING PARENTS SO IF CHILD IS 
INJURED IN WHATEVER WAY IN 
TERRIBLY TRAGIC INCIDENT LIKE THIS 
THERE IS SOME OTHER RECOURSE THAN 
TO BLAME 
WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE FOR NOW 
IF YOU HAVE ANY ANY THOUGHTS MAYBE 
YOU HAVE HAD A BOUNCING CASTLE AND 
MAYBE YOU ARE HAVING TO RE CHECK 
YOUR INSURANCE LET US KNOW 
SEVEN POINT FOUR TWO YOU ARE WATCHING BREAKFAST 
WE HAVE SEEN HIM SWEAR AT COUNTLESS 
CELEBRITIES WHO THINK THEY ARE HOT 
STUFF IN THE KITCHEN 
GORDON RAMSAY IS FOCUSING HIS ANGER 
CLOSER TO HOME HE IS CALLING FOR 
LAWS TO BAN BRITISH CHEFS FROM 
PUTTING OUT OF SEASON SEASON FRUIT 
AND VEGETABLES ON THEIR TABLES 
GORDON RAMSAY IS FAMOUS FOR HIS BAD 
TEMPER AND NOW THERE IS SOMETHING

THAT HE BELIEVES IT SHOULD BE MADE 
ILLEGAL FOR OUT OF SEASON 
VEGETABLES TO BE SERVED IN BRITISH 
RESTAURANTS RESTAURANTS FRUIT AND VEG SHOULD BE SEASONAL 
CHEFS SHOULD BE FINED IF THEY 
HAVEN'T GOT INGREDIENTS IN SEASON 
ON THEIR MENU L. DON'T WANT TO SEE 
ASPARAGUS IN THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER

FROM KENYA IN MARCH L. WANT TO SEE 
IT HOME GROWN THERE SHOULD BE LAWS 
FINED LICENSING LAWS TO MAKE SURE 
THE PRODUCE IS ONLY USE INDEED 
SEASON AND SEASON ONLY AND THE 
QUICKER WE GET THAT LEGISLATION 
PUSHED THROUGH THE HOUSES OF 
PARLIAMENT THE MORE UNIQUE THIS 
COUNTRY WILL BECOME IN TERMS OF ITS 
SOURCING AND ITS LEVELS OF 
INSPIRATION AND UNDERSTANDING THE 
SEASONAL ASPECTS WHICH MAKES IT 
MORE EXCITING FOR PUNTERS AND AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING CAUSING 
HIM TO LOSE HIS TEMPER HE IS 
FURIOUS ABOUT ANOTHER T. V. CHEF'S 
SERIES ON B. B. C. TWO 
DELIA SMITH AND HER CANNED FOODS

STRUGGLING ON FIFTEEN OR TWENTY A WEEK TO 
SURVIVE EATING FROM A CAN BUT THE 
NATION'S FAVOURITE ALL TIME ICON 
REDUCING US DOWN TO YOU KNOW USING 
FROZEN FOOD CANNED FOOD

AND FRUSTRATING AND YOU KNOW I 
THINK SHE SHOULD RE THINK HER 
POSITION AND MAYBE YOU KNOW 
RECONSIDER AND GET BACK TO THAT 
REALLY NICE SAFE METHOD DOMESTIC 
EXCITING GOOD COOKING THAT SHE WAS 
DOING FOR THIRTY YEARS 
AND HE IS ANNOYED AT HIMSELF HIS 
SHOW THE F. WORD RETURNS NEXT WEEK

IT DOES GET HIM INTO TROUBLE 
I AM NOT PROUD OF IT AND I ALWAYS

WEEK FROM HER MOTHER BECAUSE SHE IS 
PUSHING HER TROLLEY THROUGH THE 
SUPERMARKET AND HER FRIENDS ARE 
COMING UP AND SAYING OH DEARY ME 
I SAW YOUR SON LAST NIGHT AND I 
WASN'T HAPPY SO YES I DON'T DO 
IT TO OFFEND ANYONE I'M A FATHER 
OF FOUR AND I AM THERE AS ROLE 
MODEL FOR THEM AND THEY DON'T HEAR

ALWAYS SWITCH OVER 
WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT 
WHETHER CHEFS SHOULD BE UNDER

LOCAL FOOD WE'LL TALK TO A 
RESTAURANT CRITIC AND A CHEF LATER 
YOU ARE WATCHING BREAKFAST THE 
MAIN STORIES THE UNITED NATIONS 
HAS SAID IT IS EXTREMELY 
DISAPPOINTED AT THE SLOW PROGRESS 
BEING MADE GETTING PAID TO THE 
VICTIMS OF THE BURMESE CYCLONE 
CHILDREN UNDER SIX WITH READING 
DIFFICULTIES WILL BE GIVEN EXTRA 
ONE TO ONE TUITION ACROSS ENGLAND 
AFTER SUCCESSFUL TRIALS

TO THE BIG QUESTION WE HEAR FROM 
SEX AND THE CITY ACT AS SARAH 
JESSICA PARKER 
AND GET A SNEAK PEEK AT SOME OF THE 
OUTFITS AND THE SHOES L. KNOW YOU 
ARE EXCITED ABOUT THAT 
I HAVE NEVER WATCHED A WHOLE 
EPISODE EPISODE I BET CAROL HAS 
ABSOLUTELY WHAT A LOVELY START TO 
THE DAY ACROSS SOME PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY BUT NOT EVERYWHERE IN 
PLYMOUTH THERE IS A FAIR BIT OF 
CLOUD WE ARE HERE BECAUSE OF THESE 
BEAUTIFUL YACHTS THEY ARE GOING TO 
BE TAKING PART IN THE TRANSATLANTIC 
RACE LEAVING FROM PLYMOUTH ON 
SUNDAY AT TWO P. M. IT IS SAILING FROM 
PLYMOUTH TO BOSTON THEY WILL BE 
WINDS AND CURRENTS SO THEY WILL 
ENCOUNTER ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS 
EVEN IN THE FINAL LEG BECAUSE 
THERE IS DIFFICULT TO BEAT FOG THE 
OTHER THING THEY WILL ENCOUNTER IS 
APACE GLAD TO SAY NO ICE IN THE 
BRITISH ISLES THIS MORNING BUT WE 
HAVE A LOT MORE CLOUD THAN WE HAVE 
BEEN USED TO AND THERE ARE SOME 
SHOWERY OUTBREAKS OF RAIN BUT 
THERE WILL BE SOME BREAKS AND 
STILL WARM SUNSHINE ON THE 
SATELLITE PICTURE YOU CAN SEE THE 
CLOUD THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE HAD 
THE SHOWERY RAIN ANYWHERE FROM 
BRIGHTON INTO THE SOUTH WEST THAT 
SYSTEM IS MOVING NORTH EAST IF YOU 
START IN THE SOUTH EAST THIS 
MORNING AGAIN A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD 
AROUND THAT COULD PRODUCE THE ODD 
SPOT HIM AND THERE EAST ANGLIA 
HAVING A FINE START THEN THE NORTH 
OF ENGLAND A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD 
ESPECIALLY BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY TO 
THE WEST OF THE PENNINES IN THE 
NORTH EAST SUNNY SKIES AS IN THE 
NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND SOUTH WEST 
SCOTLAND HAS MORE CLOUD WITH 
SHOWERS SHOWERY RAIN ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND EXTENDING INTO 
NORTH WALES THE SAME FOR THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND ALONG 
THE COASTS OF BOTH WALES IN THE 
SOUTH WEST THERE IS ALSO SOME 
DENSE FOG TONIGHT MOST OF THAT 
WILL LIFT THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
DAY AS THAT CLOUD PUSHES NORTH 
EAST WINDS IT WILL GET INTO NORTH 
EAST ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND 
BRIGHTENING UP BEHIND IT WITH 
SHOWERS IN WALES AND THE MIDLANDS 
WHICH COULD BE HEAVY AND THUNDERY 
THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT MOST OF 
THE SHOWERS DIE AWAY CHILE IN THE 
NORTH OF SCOTLAND TOMORROW MORE 
CLOUD ACROSS SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN 
ENGLAND THAT WILL PRODUCE ONE OR 
TWO SHOWERS BUT IN ESSENCE A LOT 
OF WARM SUNSHINE ON SUNDAY THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY SEES 
THICKER CLOUD AND SHOWERS BUT THE 
FAR NORTH OF SCOTLAND AND THE REST 
OF ENGLAND AND WALES GET ANOTHER 
FINE WARM AND SUNNY DAY THAT'S IT 
AARON IS LOOKING AT THE HEALTH 
BENEFITS OF OFFICE PLANTS 
THE GREEN VARIETY BELIEVE IT WON'T 
HAVING PLANTS IN YOUR OFFICE MAKES 
YOU HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER THAT IS 
THE LATEST RESEARCH COMING FROM 
NORWAY'S AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY 
THE STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT THE MORE 
PLANTS WORKERS CAN SEE FROM THEIR 
DESKS THERE ARE FEWER SICK DAYS 
THEY TOOK OFF JOINING US IS DOCTOR 
ROSEMARY ANDERSON A PSYCHOLOGIST 
WHO RUNS A WREN COMPANY AND MARTIN 
STANNARD FROM THE LONDON PLANT 
COMPANY WELCOME BUT THAT RUNS HER 
OWN COMPANY THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT 
THESE PLANTS ARE LOVELY AND YOUR 
COMPANY IS SELLS THESE BUT CAN 
THEY OFFER ALL THESE BENEFITS YES YES THEY REMOVE TOXINS FROM THE AIR AND 
REPLACE THAT WITH MOISTURE OXYGEN 
PLANTS BREATHE AND IMPROVE THE 
WORKING ENVIRONMENT FROM A 
PSYCHOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW THEY 
REDUCE STRESS AND MAKE IT AWARE 
LOOKING OFFICE A GOOD LOOKING 
OFFICE 
PCTS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROVE OFFICE THAT PLANTS ARE THE BENEFITS I I HAVE READ THE RESEARCH BUT WE 
SHOULD NOT GET IT OUT OF 
PERSPECTIVE THIS WON'T MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE ON ITS OWN YOU HAVE TO 
LOOK AT SOCIAL FACTORS LIKE CONTROL 
AND SUPPORT BUT PLANTS TO MAKE 
THE ENVIRONMENT DOES MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE TO PRODUCTIVITY BUT I 
THINK THIS IS PROBABLY TO DO WITH 
HOW VALUED PEOPLE FEEL HOW PEOPLE 
FEEL VALUED AFFECTS THEIR HEALTH 
AND PERFORMANCE THE WORD THAT I DO 
HEARING SO MANY THINGS ABOUT HOW 
LITTLE THINGS MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
AND THIS IS A LITTLE THING WHAT WHAT SORT OF COST IS INVOLVED 
A FALL 
RENTAL AND MAINTENANCE PACKAGE FROM 
TWO POINT TWO OH A WEEK PER PLANT 
A MOST 
EXPENSIVE QUIZ MARK TWO POINT NINE OH T. U. 
AARON THANK YOU

GOOD MORNING IT IS FRIDAY NINTH MAY 
ALSO AHEAD THIS MORNING FAST 
TRACKED TO THE TOP OF THE CLASS 
HOW JUST FEW HOURS OF ONE TO ONES 
CAN HELP THE POOREST READERS I I DON'T WANT TO SEE STRAW BERRYS FROM 
KENYA IN THE MIDDLE OF MARCH 
GORDON RAMSEY CALLS FOR RESTAURANTS 
TO BE FINED FOR NOT USING SEASONAL 
FRUIT AND VEG 
AND AND ARE OLDER 
DRIVERS SAFE ON THE ROADS THIS IS 
COURSE IN SUFFOLK IS PART TO KEEP 
THEM SAFER BEHIND THE WHEEL WHAT WHAT ABOUT HAPPENED TO NEIGHBOURLYNESS

LEOPARD ABOUT LIFE ON THE ROAD AND 
THEIR BRAND NEW ALBUM

PLYMOUTH WE ARE CELEBRATING THE 
START OF THE TRANSATLANTIC RACE 
LEAVE FROM PLYMOUTH ON SUNDAY AT 
TWO THIRTY P. M. IT IS CLOUDY HERE AT THE 
MOMENT TODAY MORE CLOUD THAN WE 
HAVE BEEN USED TO BUT FOR THE 
WEEKEND WARM AND SUNNY 
FIRST OUR 
MAIN STORY CHARITIES SAY THEY ARE 
CONFIDENT THEY CAN GET AID THROUGH 
TO THOSE DESPERATELY IN NEED IN 
BURMA THEY HAVE LAUNCHED A JOINT 
APPEAL TO HELP THE ONE AND A HALF 
MILLION PEOPLE AT IMMEDIATE RISK A 
LIMITED AMOUNT OF AID HAS STARTED 
TO GET THROUGH BUT THE MILITARY 
GOVERNMENT IN BURMA HAS SAID IT 
DOES NOT WANT FOREIGN WORKERS TO 
ENTER THE COUNTRY 
A CALL FOR DONATIONS BY THE 
DISASTERS EMERGENCY COMMITTEE 
HELPING THE PEOPLE OF BURMA COMES 
WITH AN ADDED CHALLENGE CONVINCING 
DONORS THAT ANY AID THEY HAVE PAID 
FOR WILL BE ALLOWED IN FUNDS FUNDS RAISED BY THIS APPEAL WILL ONLY BE 
ALLOCATED BY THE DISASTERS 
EMERGENCY COMMITTEE TO MEMBER 
CHARITYS WHO HAVE PERMISSION TO 
BRING RELIEF TO THOSE SUFFERING 
THE UNITED NATIONS SAYS ONE AND A 
HALF MILLION PEOPLE NEED HELP AFTER 
THE CYCLONE AND IT IS WARNING OF A 
WORSE TRAGEDY IF FRUSTRATIONS LIMIT 
THE AMOUNT OF AID GETTING IN SOME 
FLIGHTS HAVE BEGUN TO ARRIVE SOME 
FOREIGN AID WORKERS HAVE BEEN 
TURNED AWAY BURMA'S FOREIGN 
MINISTRY SAID IT WOULD ACCEPT 
SUPPLIES FROM ABROAD BUT WANTED 
ITS OWN PEOPLE TO DISTRIBUTE THEM 
IN NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES WORKERS 
ARE GATHERING AND AID IS PILING UP 
FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN A 
FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE OF THE 
ARMY INVOLVED IN THIS RELIEF EFFORT 
IT IS NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH THIS IS 
AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM ANY GOVERNMENT 
WOULD STRUGGLE WITH IT THIS ONE 
DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES IT 
DOES NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE 
THERE ARE PEOPLE LOCKED OFF FROM 
THE OUTSIDE WORLD THAT ARE GOING TO 
DIE UNLESS THE BORDERS OPEN UP TO 
ALL THAT AID AND EXPERTISE WHICH IS 
SITTING OUTSIDE 
IT IT IS A 
NEGATIVE PICTURE BUT THOSE HOPING 
TO SECURE DONATIONS SAY THEY ARE 
NOT GIVING UP HOPE IN REACHING 
THOSE IN NEED 
THERE ARE 
SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS GOING ON WE 
HAVE FOR THE RED CROSS SEVENTEEN THOUSAND 
VOLUNTEERS WORLD VISION HAS A 
SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE SAVE THE 
CHILDREN HAS REACHED SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
THIS IS NOT ENOUGH BUT IT IS A 
BEGINNING 
THERE ARE WARNING THAT BEGINNING ANY EFFECTIVE RELIEF EFFORT WILL 
NEED FAR MORE AID THAN THOSE 
ALREADY INSIDE BURMA WILL BE ABLE 
TO PROVIDE 
CHILDREN WHO STILL STRUGGLE TO READ 
BY THE AGE OF SIX ARE OVERTAKING 
THE REST OF THEIR CLASS AFTER A FEW 
HOURS OF SPECIALIST ONE TWO ONE 
TEACHING THE GOVERNMENT EVERY 
CHILD A READER SCHEME WILL BE 
ROLLED OUT TO EVERY SCHOOL IN THE 
AUTUMN TERM 
STRUGGLING TO READ SHOCKINGLY SIX 
OUT OF EVERY ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN NEVER 
LEARN PROPERLY THEY LEAVE SCHOOL 
BARELY LITERATE THAT WILL NOT 
HAPPEN TO HELEN SHE AND OTHERS AT 
THIS SCHOOL BENEFIT FROM INTENSE 
SIEVE ONE TO ONE TUITION HALF AN 
HOUR A DAY FOR SIX MONTHSMENT IT IS 
SHOWING DRAMATIC RESULTS 
IT IS 
HARD BECAUSE I CAN'T READ THE WORDS 
PROPERLY PROPERLY AND NOW IS IT GETTING EASIER YES YES RESEARCH BY THE INSTITUTION FOR 
EPLGATION FOUND THE APPROACH CALLED 
READING RECOVERY BROUGHT THE WORST 
IN THE CLASS UP TO ABOVE AVERAGE 
IT IS EXPENSIVE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED A PUPIL IS 
IT WORTH IT 
I KNOW CLEARLY FROM 
THE WAY SCHOOLS OPERATE THAT IF YOU 
DON'T ADDRESS ISSUES IN THE EARLY 
YEARS IN KEY STAGE ONE LATER ON 
YOU GET TRIPLE THE PROBLEMS AND 
DOUBLE THE COST YES READING 
RECOVERY IS EXPENSIVE BUT IT IS 
WORTH IT 
THE GOVERNMENT TOO IS 
IMPRESSED AND HAS PROMED TO ROLL 
OUT THE SCHEME ACROSS ENGLAND OVER 
THE NEXT THREE YEARS IF READING 
RECOVERY IS SO EFFECTIVE THEN IT 
RAISES A FEW QUESTIONS THE SYSTEM 
HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME 
WHY WASN'T IT INTRODUCED YEARS AGO 
IF IT HAD BEEN HOW MANY CHILDREN'S 
LIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED 
THE AUSTRIAN MAN WHO IMPRISONED HIS 
TAUGHTER FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS IS EXPECTED 
TO APPEAR IN COURT TODAY A JUDGE 
WILL DECIDE WHETHER JOSEF FRITZL 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE REMANDED IN 
CUSTODY AS THE INVESTIGATION 
CONTINUES FRITZL KEPT HIS DAUGHTER 
CAPTIVE IN A CELLAR AND FATHERED 
SEVEN CHILDREN WITH HER HOME 
OWNERS STRULINGLING STRUGGLING 
WITH THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS ARE TO 
GET HELP MORE SUPPORT WILL BE 
GIVEN TO ORGANISATIONS PROVIDING 
DEBT ADVICE CELEBRITY CHEF GORDON 
RAMSEY SAID BRITISH RESTAURANTS 
SHOULD BE BANNED FROM SERVING FRUIT 
AND VEGETABLES WHICH ARE NOT IN 
SEASON HE SAID THE MOVE WOULD HELP 
THE ENVIRONMENT BY CUTTING DOWN ON 
FOODS BEING TRANSPORTED AROUND THE 
WORLDMENT HE SAID IT WOULD FORCE 
CHEFS TO COME UP WITH BETTER AND 
MORE CREATIVE DISHES 
THERE SHOULD 
BE STRINGENT LAWS FINES 
LICENSING LAWS TO MAKE SURE THIS 
PRODUCE IS USED ONLY IN SEASON AND 
SEASON ONLY THE QUICKER WE GET IT 
PUSHED THROUGH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
THEN THE MORE UNIQUE THIS COUNTRY 
WILL COME 
THE PLANNED OVERHAUL OF 
THE N. H. S. IN ENGLAND WILL BENEFIT 
PATIENTS AND STAFF ACCORDING TO THE 
GOVERNMENT LORD DARZI WHO IS 
LEADING A REVIEW OF THE HEALTH 
SERVICE HAS PLEDGED ANY DECISIONS 
WILL BE MADE AT A LOCAL LEVEL 
CRITICS SAY IT WILL LEAD TO CLOSURE 
OF HOSPITAL DEPARTMENTS AND THE 
UNDERMINING OF G. P. SURGERIES LITTLE 
RUBEN HAS HAD A FIT A FEW YEARS

ITS OWN SET OF REFORMS SUGGESTED 
BY STAFF AND BY PATIENTS RATHER 
THAN BEING IMPOSED FROM ABOVE THE 
MAN LEADING THE REVIEW IS LORD 
DARZI HEALTH MINISTER AND SURGEON 
THE GOVERNMENT IS KEEN TO EMPHASISE 
HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WILL THESE 
CHANGES MEAN DIFFERENT PRIORITIES 
IN DIFFERENT AREAS MORE OF A POST 
CODE 
THERE ARE MORE 
CODE LOTTERY PRIORITIES THAT IS A REFLECTION OF 
THE CHANGING NATURE OF MEDICINE 
THAT IS WHY THIS REVIEW WILL ALLOW 
AT A LOCAL LEVEL FOR PEOPLE TO 
APRIZE WHAT THEIR PRIORITYS ARE AND 
DEAL WITH THESE PRIORITIES IN THE 
MOST COMPREHENSIVE WAY 
CRITICS SAY 
THE REAL AGENDA IS GETTING RID OF 
SMALL G. P. PRACTICES AND REPLACING 
THEM WITH BIG CENTRES LIKE THIS ONE 
AND THE N. H. S. HAS SEEN TOO MUCH 
CHANGE ALREADY 
SOME PEOPLE STILL ARE NOT WEARING 
SEAT BELTS THE CHIEF FIRE 
OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION SAY IT IS NOT 
UNUSUAL TO GO TO AN ACCIDENT 
INVOLVING THREE OR FOUR YOUNG 
PEOPLE AND FINDING NONE WERE 
WEARING A SEAT BELT IT WANTS 
TOUGHER LAWS TO TRY AND TACKLE THE 
PROBLEM DESPITE CONCERNS ABOUT 
FALLING HOUSE PRICES A WOODEN 
BAECH HUT ON THE SUFFOLK COAST IS 
EXPECTED TO SELL FOR MORE THAN 
EIGHTY THOUSAND ESTATE AGENTS SAY IT

ON THE STREETS OF LONDON SO FAR 
THIS YEAR THE GANG MEMBERS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING TWO OF THOSE 
LIVES WILL BE SENTENCED TODAY ONE 
OF THE VICTIMS WAS STAN STABBED TO

NUMEROUS OTHER CRIMES DID CAUSE 
CONSIDERABLE CONCERN AND WRAIZ THE 
AWARENESS OF YOUNG GANG AND RAISE 
THE AWARENESS OF YOUNG GANGS 
RUNNING ON THE INNER CITIES IN 
LIFE THEY NEVER MET IN DEATH THEIR 
DEATHS ARE LINKED KODJO YENGA 
STABBED TO DEATH IN HAMMERSMITH ON 
THE RIGHT FOURTEEN YEAR OLD PAUL ERHAHAN 
MURDERED IN WALTHAMSTOW A MONTH 
LATER KODJO YENGA DIED WHILE OUT

A DIRECT PRO PRODUCT OF THE 
EDUCATION ITSELF 
TODAY ELEVEN 
TEENAGERS WILL BE JAILED TWO SPLIT 
SECONDS THAT WILL DEVASTATE THE 
LIVES OF THIRTEEN PEOPLE FAIR FAMILIES 
AND FRIENDS FOR EVER L. AM JOINED 
NOW BY DETECTIVE CHIEF INSPECTOR 
DICK MATTHEW HORNE THESE ARE TWO 
VERY DIFFERENT CRIMES WHAT CAN WE 
LEARN FROM THEM 
KODJO YENGA WAS SIXTEEN 
PAUL ERHAHAN WAS FOURTEEN THERE WAS ONLY 
ONE BOY ON EACH OCCASION WHO DEALT 
THAT FATAL BLOW THERE WERE FIVE 
PEOPLE CONVICTED OF KILLING EACH OF 
THESE BOYS F. YOU GO OUT WITH THE 
INTENT TO ROB SOMEBODY IF YOU GO 
OUT INTENDING TO HURT PEOPLE THEN 
LIKE IN THIS CASE THE JURY WILL 
FIND YOU GUILTY THE SAME WAY THAT 
BOY WHO DEALT THAT FATAL BLOW WAS 
IF YOU GO OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS YOU 
HAVE TO ACCEPT THOSE CONSEQUENCES 
THE OTHER THING IS BRAVE PEOPLE 
GAVE EVIDENCE IN THESE CASES WE 
OWE THEM GRATTY TUED THEY DID SO 
SOMETIMES ANONYMOUSLY SOMETIMES 
WITH THEIR VOICES DISTORTED 
WORKING TOGETHER PEOPLE WILL GIVE 
EVIDENCE LEADING TO CONVICTIONS 
ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT YOUNGSTERS 
LIKE THESE ARE OUT AND ABOUT IN 
GANGS ANY WAY 
VERY MUCH SO THAT 
IS A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF US 
WHAT I WILL SAY ABOUT THAT AND I 
WILL ASK PARENTS WHERE DID THEY 
THINK THEIR BOYS WERE THIS WAS NOT 
TWO A M. BOTH THESE BOYS WERE KILLED 
DURING THE DAY WHAT DID THE 
PARENTS THINK WAS HAPPENING AT THAT 
POINT AT THAT TIME OF THE DAY DO 
YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR CHILDREN ARE 
SOME OF THESE KIDSS WERE AS YOUNG 
ADDRESS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD THE THE SENTENCING OF THESE YOUTHS WILL 
TAKE PLACE LATER TODAY IT MAY BE 
AT THAT TIME THAT REPORTING 
RESTRICTIONS ARE LIFTED AND THE 
COURT WILL ROLE THEIR NAMES CAN BE 
GIVEN OUT IN PUBLIC

THESE ARE POTENTIAL BUYERS WARD IS 
CLAIMED TO BE A LESS ALL A LESS 
DANGEROUS ALTERNATIVE TO GUNS 
I HAVE WHOLE BUNCH OF QUESTIONS 
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE WON AND 
YOU SIT THERE MAY YOURSELF IT MUST 
HAVE SOME SORT OF SAFETY DEVICE 
THEY MUST BE STRAIGHT FORWARD AND 
TO DO THAT ONE ALSO AFTER YOU 
FIRE IT IS THE CURRENT STILL GOING 
THROUGH IT IF IT DOES NOT HIT ITS

OF THOSE REPORTS WHICH LEAVES YOU

MAY BE ONE THING PASSING YOUR 
DRIVING TEST OLDER DRIVERS ARE 
BEING ENCOURAGED TO TEST WHETHER

USUALLY WHEN THEY COME TO UNUSUAL 
JUNCTIONS PLACES THEY ARE NOT USED

DIVERSION AND UP SOME WERE THERE 
ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH AND ENDED UP 
ON THE WRONG ROAD 
IF JUST LIKE THIS ELDERLY COUPLE 
WHO TURNED THE WRONG WAY UP A DUAL 
CARRIAGEWAY IN NORFOLK 
ONE OF THE ISSUES IN DRIVING HIS 
THAT IT IS A COMPLEX ACTIVITY AND 
YOU ARE REQUIRED TO DO A LOT OF 
THINKING VERY QUICKLY ESPECIALLY 
AT SPEED IF YOU COME ACROSS NEW 
SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TO REACT 
QUICKLY AS YOU GET OLDER THAT 
TAKES A LITTLE BIT LONGER 
SOMETIMES YOU MAY MAKE A MISTAKE 
MAUREEN HAS BECOME A BETTER DRIVER

UNCOMFORTABLE BUT I GUESS HE WOULD 
WOULD SAY THAT'S PART OF THE JOB

COMPLAIN ABOUT HIS FELLOW CHEFS 
USING KIWIS WHEN THEY SHOULD BE 
USING PARSNIPS 
USING PARSNIPS GORDON RAMSAY SPOKE TO COLIN 
PATTERSON ABOUT HIS OUTRAGE 
DON'T BRING YOUR MOTHER INTO IT 
GORDON RAMSAY IS FAMOUS FOR HIS BAD 
TEMPER AND NOW THERE IS SOMETHING 
ELSE MAKING HIM ANGRY HE TOLD ME 
HE THINKS IT SHOULD BE MADE ILLEGAL 
FOR OUT OF SEASON FRUIT AND 
VEGETABLE TO BE SERVED IN 
RESTAURANT RESTAURANT CHEFS SHOULD BE FINED IF THEY 
HAVEN'T GOT INGREDIENTS IN SEASON 
ON THEIR MENU DON WANT TO SEE 
ASPARAGUS IN DECEMBER L. DON'T WANT 
TO SEE STRAWBERRIES FROM KENYA IN 
MARCH I WANT TO SEE IT HOME GROWN 
THERE SHOULD BE STRINGENT LAWS 
FINED LICENSING LAWS TO MAKE SURE 
THIS PRODUCE IS ONLY USED IN SEASON 
AND SEASON ONLY AND THE QUICKER WE 
GET THAT LEGISLATION PUSHED THROUGH 
THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT THE MORE 
UNIQUE THIS COUNTRY WILL BECOME IN 
TERMS OF ITS SOURCING AND LEVELS OF 
INSPIRATION AND UNDERSTANDING THE 
SEASONAL ASPECTS WHICH MAKES IT 
MORE EXCITING FOR PUNTERS 
YES 
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING 
CAUSING HIM TO LOSE HIS TEMPER HE 
IS FURIOUS ABOUT ANOTHER T. V. CHEF'S 
SERIES ON B. B. C. TWO 
DELIA SMITH AND HER CANNED FOODS 
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT WITH WITH DELIA I'M FRUSTRATED BECAUSE IT'S 
IT'S A KICK IN THE GHOULIES FOR THE 
NATION BECAUSE I EXPECT STUDENTS 
STRUGGLING ON FIFTEEN OR TWENTY A WEEK TO 
SURVIVE EATING FROM A CAN BUT THE 
NATION'S FAV ALL TIME FAVOURITE 
ALL TIME ICON REDUCING US DOWN TO 
YOU KNOW USING FROZEN FOOD CANNED 
FOOD NOW THAT HURTS SO IT'S 
APPALLING IT IS FRUSTRATING AND 
YOU KNOW I THINK SHE SHOULD RE 
THINK HER POSITION AND MAYBE YOU 
KNOW RECONSIDER AND GET BACK TO 
THAT REALLY NICE SORT OF SAFE 
METHOD DOMESTIC EXCITING GOOD 
COOKING THAT SHE WAS DOING FOR THIRTY 
YEARS YEARS AND HE IS ANNOYED AT HIMSELF HIS 
SHOW THE F. WORD RETURNS NEXT WEEK 
AND HE ADMITS THAT ALL THE SWEARING 
IN IT DOES GET HIM INTO TROUBLE 
I'M NOT PROUD OF IT AND I ALWAYS 
GET AN EAR BASHING AT LEAST ONCE A 
WEEK FROM MY MOTHER SHE IS PUSHING 
HER TROLLEY THROUGH THE SUPERMARKET 
AND HER FRIENDS ARE COMING UP AND 
SAYING OH DEARY ME I SAW YOUR SON 
LAST NIGHT I WASN'T HAPPY I 
DON'T DO IT TO OWED FEND ANYONE 
I'M A FATHER OF FOUR AND I'M THERE 
AS A ROLE MODEL FOR THEM AND THEY 
DON'T HEAR ME SWEAR SO YOU CAN 
ALWAYS SWITCH OVER 
SHOULD THERE BE A LAW TO BAN 
RESTAURANTS FROM SERVING OUT OF 
SEASON FRUIT AND VEGETABLE 
LET'S SPEAK TO ALEX AND JAY 
ALEX WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD 
RESTAURANTS BE FORCE TODAY USE 
LOCAL SEASONAL STUFF 
WHAT I WOULD 
BE WORRIED ABOUT A RESTAURANT THAT 
DIDN'T WANT WE WANT TO BECAUSE IT 
TASTES GOOD AND THAT'S WHAT IS 
IMPORTANT AND THAT'S NOT JUST IN 
RESTAURANTS THAT'S OVER THE PLACE 
I'M MORE OF A COOKERY TEACHER AND I 
TRY TO GET INVOLVED WITH CHILDREN 
AND WHEN YOU SHOW KIDS YOU SHOW 
THEM THE WONDERFUL INGREDIENTS A 
STRAWBERRY WHEN IT IS NICE AND 
SWEET THEY LOVE IT THEY REALLY GO 
FOR IT AND THAT'S THE REWARD BUT 
ALSO OUT OF SEASON YOU TAKE STUFF 
THAT YOU PRESERVE WHY NOT YOU 
NEVER NEED TO BE LIMITED TO WHAT'S 
GROWING AT THE TIME 
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THE REASON 
YOU TO GO TO A RESTAURANT IS TO 
HAVE STUFF YOU WOULDN'T OTHERWISE 
HAVE NORMALLY YOU GO FOR THINGS 
THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE AT HOME THE 
IDEA OF OF NOT HAVING UNUSUAL 
THINGS SEEMS ODD 
I HAVE TO SAY A 
COUPLE OF THINGSMENT GORDON IS 
PLAYING TO THE GALLERY THIS IS A 
MAN WHO RUNS A RESTAURANT IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST NOTHING IS SEASONAL I 
ASKED HIM TO START PUTTING A CARBON 
LEVY ON HIS CUSTOMERS AND HE 
REFUSED REFUSED HE IS NOT TALKING ABOUT DUBAI HE 
IS TALKING ABOUT ENGLAND 
HE EITHER PRACTISES WHAT HE 
PREACHES OR DONE 
WE DON'T WANT TO EAT OUT OF SEASON 
ASPARAGUS WILL COME INTO SEASON A 
GOOD RASPBERRY AND A GOOD 
STRAWBERRY IN SUMMER IF YOU TRY TO 
EAT A SEASONAL MENU IN BRITAIN IN 
THE DARKEST WINTER MONTHS IT WOULD 
BE DULL EVEN IF YOU GO FOR THE 
PRESERVED GOODS 
I DISAGREE 
I SPENT A SUMMER IN THE THE SOUTH 
OF ITALY AND SIX SUMMERS IN FRANCE 
AND THERE IT IS PRESERVING ALL THE 
TIME WE GOT FOUR TONNES OF 
TOMATOES AND WE MADE TOMATO SAUCE 
WITH THEM OVER TWO DAYS AND WE USE 
THAT HAD THROUGHOUT THE WINTERMENT 
IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE 
WE ALL 
LIVED IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE 
NO IT IS THE SAME HERE BUT WITH 
DIFFERENT THINGS 
FOR THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF I 
HAVE BEEN EATING PURPLE SPROUTING 
BROCCOLI THERE IS TONNES OF GOOD 
THINGS IN ENGLAND THAT WE CAN USE 
AND PRESERVE DON'T THINK WE 
SHOULD SAY WE WILL FINE PEOPLE BUT 
WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO WANT 
TO COOK AND WANT TO EAT THINGS 
PMENT 
THE IDEA THAT SOME OF THE PMENT CHEFS GORDON RAMSAY INCLUDED HAVE 
ENCOURAGED US TO GET INTERESTED IN 
FOOD AND THE DISHES THAT ARE 
AVAILABLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD AT 
ANY TIME SUDDENLY IT IS HOLD ON A 
MINUTE MINUTE HAVE YOU TRIED COOKING LEMON R. A. F. 
LEMON RAVOLLI 
I WOULD LIKE TO FINE HIM FOR SOME 
OF THE MEALS I HAVE HAD IN HIS 
RESTAURANTS PUT THAT ASIDE THE 
CHEFS AND HAVE BEEN INTRODUCING US 
TO THE GLOBAL LARDER WE NEED TO 
PULL BACK 
GORDON'S PEOPLE SAY HIS COMMENTS 
ARE DIRECTED AT BRITISH CHEFS WHO 
HAVE EASY ACCESS TO SEASONAL AND 
LOCALLY PRODUCED FOODS IS THERE A 
SENSE THAT WE HAVE LOST TOUCH WITH 
THAT AND IT IS JUST ABOUT PUTTING 
PRESSURE ON PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THAT 
FIRST AND THE EXOTIC STUFF LATER 
THAT'S THE PERFECT QUESTION THAT'S 
WHAT IT IS AROUND ABOUT CHRISTMAS 
TIME IF IF YOU HAVE HAD YOU ARE 
FULL OF PEARS AND APPLES GO FOR 
THE TROPICAL FRUIT GO FOR 
PINEAPPLES AND MANGOES AND IT 
CHEERS YOU UP YOU'RE LAUGHING AT 
ME HERE 
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT LOCAL IT IS 
SEASONAL SOMEWHERE IT IS 
DIFFICULT THING TO SAY YOU CAN'T 
HAVE TROPICAL FRUIT IF YOU ARE 
GOING TO EAT WHAT'S IN THIS COUNTRY 
BUT WE SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT'S IN 
SEASON FIRST BECAUSE IT TASTES 
FANTASTIC LAST WEEK I DID 
COOKERY WORKSHOP WITH DELIA SMITH 
WE GOT ASPARAGUS IT WAS PICKED 
THAT MORNING WE GOT IT PREPD IT 
AND ATE 
THIS ROW MAYBE WILL CARRY ON IN THE 
GREEN ROOM WHERE THERE IS NO EXOTIC 
PRODUCE PRODUCE THERE IS A FEW BISCUITS AND A CUP 
OF TEA 
THIS WEEK WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT 
THE NATION'S NEIGHBOURLINESS AND

THING EITHER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

IN THE BAND'S CAREER WHEN THAT

I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE 
THESE FANS WILL BE BREAKING DOWN 
THE THE DOORS TO SEE THE NEW 
FILMMENT THEY ARE ON A HIGH THEY 
HAVE BEEN WATCHING RERUNS OF THE 
SHOW SINCE IT WENT OFF THE AIR FOUR 
YEARS AGO 
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THE CORE 
AUDIENCE ARE SEW FIST KATED WOMEN

REACH BEYOND THAT 
THERE WAS A TIME 
THAT WAS OUR CORE AUDIENCE BUT WE 
HAVE BEEN ON THE AIR FOUR YEARS

THE NEW MOVIE 
THERE IS LOT OF PRODUCT PLACEMENT 
IN THE FULL TIME ISN'T THERE HOW 
DO YOU GET THE THE BALANCE RIGHT 
BETWEEN KEEPING IT ON THE EDGE OF 
BEING ART AND NOT LETTING IT BECOME 
ONE BIG COMMERCIAL 
YOU HAVE TO BE 
CAREFUL AND NOT SELL YOURSELF DOWN 
THE RIVER BUT IT TAKES GOOD 
COUNSEL AND SMART CHOICES ABOUT 
WHAT IS HELPING THE MOVIE AND WHAT 
ISN'T DISTRACTING 
WHAT EVERY FAN WANTS TO KNOW IS 
WHAT IS THE NEW MOVIE THE STUDIO 
IS TRYING TO KEEP THE PLOT UNDER 
WRAPSMENT 
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM WRAPSMENT BEFORE THE SCREENING THE PUBLICIST 
WE CAN BRAG ABOUT IT BUT CAN'T 
BLOG ABOUT IT 
WE ARE HARD TO 
MAINTAIN SOME OBVIOUS PLOT THINGS 
WE TRY TO KEEP SECRET SO YOU CAN 
BRAG ABOUT IT BUT YOU CAN'T BLOG 
ABOUT IT THAT MEANS THE PLOT 
POINTS POINTS I SUSPECT YOU WANT TO BE HONOUR 
BOUND BOUND I WANT TO TELL PEOPLE BUT I CAN'T 
THAT'S GOOD 
I WILL KEEP MYSELF UNDER CONTROL 
THINK OF YOURSELF AS PRIVILEGED 
INFORMATION INFORMATION WHAT I CAN SAY AND THIS ISN'T
