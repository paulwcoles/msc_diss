BREAD SLICED WHITE FOUR LOAVES 
NO WE DON'T WANT TO RUN OUT BEST GET SIX HONEY O. K. 
AND BUTTER FRANK LOVED HIS BUTTER 
AND LOTS OF FILLINGS CHEESE HAM TUNA THE WORKS DIANE YES PAT 
AFTERS CHOCOLATE CAKE BISCUITS HE ALWAYS HAD A SWEET TOOTH 
BIANCA'S STILL NOT ANSWERING HER PHONE 
AND SWISS ROLLS FRANK ALWAYS LOVED HIS SWISS ROLLS 
RICKY YEAH 
BANNERS STREAMERS BALLOONS WHAT 
HE WANTED A KNEES UP DIDN'T HE 
WELL YEAH BUT 
IF FRANK WANTED A KNEES UP FRANK IS GONNA GET A KNEES UP 
RIGHT ANY QUESTIONS 
WELL GO ON THEN CHOP CHOP 
DO YOU THINK SHE'S ACTUALLY TAKEN IT IN THAT DAD'S DIED 
HE ONLY WENT TO THE DOCTORS FOR A HEADACHE 
RICKY TOLD ME TOWARDS THE END HE COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK 
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE FRANK BUTCHER WITHOUT SOMETHING TO SAY FOR HIMSELF 
HE WAS ALWAYS GIVING IT PLENTY OF THAT 
FULL OF SCHEMES AND PLANS 
GOOD TIMES WAITING JUST ROUND THE CORNER 
POOR OLD FRANK 
NO MORE SCHEMES OR PLANS HE WANTS ONE LAST RIDE AROUND ALBERT SQUARE 
AND THEN A WAKE HERE 
OR DID I TELL YOU THAT ALREADY 
OH I KEEP REPEATING MYSELF IT'S O. K. 
I'M LIKE AN OLD WOMAN YOU AIN'T AN OLD WOMAN 
WELL I FEEL LIKE IT WELL YOU AIN'T ALL RIGHT 
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING JUST GIVE ME A CALL I GOTTA GET GOING O. K. 
NOT THE FIRST TIME FRANK'S DIED 
NO HIS LAST FUNERAL WAS IN SPAIN 
THEY HAD A SPACE FOR HIM WAITING IN THE WALL 
IN THE WALL THEY DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY OVER THERE 
SO THIS LAST TIME HE DIED 
WELL HE WASN'T REALLY DEAD 
I WORKED THAT OUT FOR MYSELF 
I CAME OUT THE CEMETERY AND I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET 
AND THERE HE WAS SITTING IN THE CAR 
WITH A PAIR OF BIG DARK SHADES COVERING HIS FACE 
SO IT WAS A SCAM 
HA LIFE WAS ONE BIG SCAM WITH FRANK 
BUT PRETENDING TO BE DEAD 
YEAH 
WHAT A SWINE HE WAS A SWINE A CHARLATAN A CON MAN 
AND A CHEAT 
WE AIN'T GOT TIME FOR ANY OF THAT STUFF NOW 
WE HAVE GOT HIS PARTY TO ORGANIZE 
HE'S GOT SOME FRONT AIN'T HE AFTER THE WAY HE'S BEHAVED 
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS PAT BECAUSE HE WANTS IT 
AND WHEN FRANK SAYS JUMP WE SAY HOW HIGH 
BIANCA IT'S ME AGAIN IF YOU COULD 
HE'S GONNA BE ON THE FLOOR IF SHE DOESN'T BRING LIAM WELL A FUNERAL'S NO PLACE FOR CHILDREN 
YOU'RE RIGHT MY SON JACQUES REFUSED TO COME 
DOT 
DIANE FRANK'S DAUGHTER OH DIANE OF COURSE 
OH I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS 
THANK YOU I HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR 
IS ER JANINE COMING TO THE FUNERAL 
WE HAVEN'T HEARD 
OH AND YOUR OTHER SISTER WHAT'S HER NAME CLAIRE OH YES CLAIRE 
SHE LIVES IN AUSTRALIA NOW OOH 
SHE CAME OVER TO SEE DAD WHILE HE WAS YOU KNOW BEFORE HE DIED 
SHE SAID HER GOODBYES THEN 
IT'S NICE YOU'RE HAVING THE FUNERAL FROM THE SQUARE 
IT'S WHAT HE WANTED 
APPARENTLY HE TOLD RICKY THAT HIS HEART WAS HERE 
FRANK BUTCHER DIDN'T HAVE A HEART 
WELL I AGREE IT WASN'T ALWAYS EASY TO FIND IT SOMETIMES 
DEAD AND IN A BOX AND HE'S STILL PULLING THE STRINGS 
THIS PARTY 
THE ONLY THING EITHER ONE OF US COULD DEPEND ON FRANK BUTCHER FOR 
WAS THAT HE'D LET US DOWN 
AND YET HE'S EXPECTING US TO DO ALL THIS FOR HIM 
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT FOR HIM 
I WANT TO DO IT FOR ME 
TO MAKE SENSE OF ALL THOSE YEARS 
NO COS I DON'T FANCY THE ALTERNATIVE 
WHICH IS GOING TO THE CREM 
SINGING A HYMN WATCHING THE CURTAINS CLOSE AND THEN WHAT 
GOING HOME HAVING A CUP OF TEA 
TURNING ON THE TELLY LIKE NOTHING'S HAPPENED 
I DON'T WANT TO CELEBRATE HIS LIFE 
PEGGY WE'VE HAD OUR BATTLES OVER FRANK IN THE PAST YEAH ONCE OR TWICE 
AND WE GOT THROUGH ALL THAT WE'RE HERE AND WE'RE FRIENDS 
PERHAPS THAT'S WORTH CELEBRATING EH 
BESIDES WE BOTH LOVED HIM 
HE DIDN'T LOVE US THOUGH DID HE 
THE ONLY PERSON FRANK BUTCHER EVER LOVED WAS HIMSELF 
ALL RIGHT MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT MAYBE HE DIDN'T LOVE ME OR YOU 
THERE'S NO MAYBE ABOUT IT 
BUT I LOVED HIM AND I THINK YOU LOVED HIM TOO 
SO IF WE HAVE THIS PARTY 
IF WE STAND SIDE BY SIDE AND RAISE OUR GLASSES TOGETHER 
MAYBE JUST MAYBE IT MIGHT MAKE SOME SENSE 
OF THE WHOLE BLOODY MESS 
PUT THIS LOT ON THE TABLE WE CLEARED NEARLY EVERY SHELF IN THE MINUTE MART 
FEELS WRONG HAVING BALLOONS AT A WAKE 
IT'S WHAT HE WANTS 
O. K. 
LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD 
I WENT TO SEE THE FLAT AGAIN LAST NIGHT 
THE ONE IN MUSWELL HILL YEAH GO ON NEAR MY PARENTS 
THEY'VE GONE AND ACCEPTED OUR OFFER WHAT ABOUT THE DEPOSIT 
WELL DADDY'S STILL THINKING ABOUT IT

TIDY UP ROUND THEM EARS WHAT DO YOU THINK 
RICKY 
YEAH COMING 
THOUGHT I LOVED HIM BUT NAH I DIDN'T 
YES YOU DID 
I WAS FLATTERED 
SWEPT OFF ME FEET BUT NAH WASN'T LOVE 
COULDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT THINKING ABOUT YOU AND HIM 
WHAT ME AND FRANK DID WAS WRONG VERY WRONG 
OH I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU AND HIM HAVING SEX TOGETHER 
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU PERSUADING ME TO MARRY HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE 
I DIDN'T WANT TO MARRY FRANK 
PHIL AND GRANT DIDN'T WANT ME TO MARRY FRANK EVEN FRANK DIDN'T WANT ME TO MARRY FRANK 
BUT YOU GOT IN THERE AND STIRRED IT ALL UP YOU MADE IT HAPPEN 
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT YEAH YOU HAD US DANCING TO YOUR TUNE NO 
BUT WHAT WAS IN IT FOR YOU THOUGH THAT'S WHAT I CAN'T WORK OUT 
WHY DID YOU WANT US TO GET MARRIED 
BECAUSE YOU LOVED FRANK AND HE LOVED YOU 
HE WAS WALKING OUT THE CHURCH WHEN I ARRIVED 
YOU WERE SO LATE GETTING THERE 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO MARRY ME 
PEGGY HE THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T GONNA TURN UP 
THE LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN I DID SHEER PANIC NO 
HE WAS LIKE A RAT IN THE TRAP AND YOU PUT HIM IN THAT TRAP 
I WOULDN'T HAVE TURNED UP IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU YOU MADE IT HAPPEN WHY 
BECAUSE I WANTED TO HELP 
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO KEEP HIM ON THE SQUARE 
YOU DID WANT TO MARRY HIM 
YOU WANTED TO KEEP HIM LIKE A FLY IN YOUR WEB UNTIL YOU WERE READY TO POUNCE 
NO YOU DON'T REGRET MARRYING HIM 
AH THE BIGGEST REGRET OF MY LIFE 
COME ON PEGGY YOU HAD SOME GOOD TIMES 
WE HAD SOME GOOD TIMES TOGETHER DIDNT WE ME AND ROY YOU AND FRANK 
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS MAKING EVERYTHING SO COSY AND NICE 
I'M NOT FRANK WASN'T COSY AND NICE 
HE WANTED EVERYONE TO THINK SO TALKING THE TALK 
WALKING THE WALK MAKING EVERYBODY FEEL LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS 
BUT THAT WASN'T THE REAL FRANK 
THE REAL FRANK WAS HORRIBLE NASTY AND ROTTEN 
NO HE WASN'T RIGHT THROUGH TO THE CORE 
ALL RIGHT SO HE MADE MISTAKES SOMETIMES 
BUT HE WAS THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT HE WAS NO ANGEL 
DEEP DOWN HE WAS PURE GOLD 
OH YOU'RE SPINING YOURSELF A YARN PAT TELLING YOURSELF STORIES EMPTY WORDS 
YOU'RE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH YOU TWO ARE 
START ON THE FILLINGS SHALL I 
YOU KNOW I CAN BEAR THE THOUGHT OF YOU AND HIM IN BED TOGETHER 
NOT A PRETTY SIGHT BUT I CAN BEAR IT 
BUT WHAT HURTS EVEN NOW IS THINKING OF YOU AND HIM 
WITH YOUR HEADS TOGETHER LAUGHING AT ME 
I HAVE SAID SORRY PEGGY 
I HAVE SAID SORRY SO MANY TIMES AGAIN AND AGAIN 
I CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST 
BUT WOULD YOU IF YOU COULD 
WHY YOU TALKING LIKE THIS 
WOULD YOU GO BACK AND MAKE THINGS DIFFERENT WOULD YOU 
NO ONE CAN CHANGE THINGS 
BUT IF YOU COULD WOULD YOU 
WHAT HAPPENED HAPPENED YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT IT AND MOVE ON 
THEN THAT'S A NO THEN YOU'RE NOT SORRY PAT 
YOU'RE NOT SORRY ONE LITTLE BIT 
FEELS WEIRD BEING BACK HERE MELINDA SAYS D'YOU WANT COFFEE 
YEAH PLEASE 
I KNOW MY LIFE'S MOVED ON BUT SOMEHOW I THINK I EXPECTED EVERYTHING HERE TO BE JUST THE SAME 
MILK SUGAR NO JUST BLACK 
YOU USED TO HAVE IT WHITE WITH TWO SUGARS DIDN'T YOU YEAH NOT ANY MORE RIGHT 
DID YOU THINK THAT WHAT'S THAT 
THAT SOMEHOW EVERYTHING WOULD BE WAITING FOR US HERE LIKE IT USED TO BE 
NOT REALLY NO 
I'M NOT PROUD OF MYSELF PEGGY 
I WAS ASHAMED THEN AND I'M ASHAMED NOW 
THE ONLY EXCUSE I'VE GOT IS THAT WHEN I WAS A YOUNG GIRL 
I MET THIS BLOKE AND FELL IN LOVE 
AND THAT LOVE LASTED THE WHOLE OF MY LIFE 
OH NICE PERFORMANCE PAT YOU KNOW MISTY EYES QUIVERING LIP 
YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN FRANK A RUN FOR HIS MONEY 
I DIDN'T ALWAYS LIKE HIM SOMETIMES I HATED HIM 
BUT I NEVER STOPPED LOVING HIM OH PLEASE 
YOU OBVIOUSLY NEVER HAD WITH ANYBODY WHAT I HAD WITH FRANK I LOVED MY ERIC 
NOT LIKE I LOVED FRANK OR YOU'D UNDERSTAND 
NEXT YOU'LL BE TELLING ME IT WAS A TRULY BEAUTIFUL THING 
IT WASN'T BEAUTIFUL 
IT WASN'T UGLY NEITHER IT WAS JUST WHAT IT WAS 
THE LAST TIME I SAW FRANK WAS JUST AFTER JANINE'S TRIAL 
D'YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID TO ME 
HE SAID TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF BABE 
AND I SAID I'M TOO OLD TO BE ANYBODY'S BABE 
AND HE SAID 
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MINE RIGHT UP TO MY LAST BREATH AND BEYOND 
OH THEY WERE WORDS 
THEY CAME EASY TO FRANK 
DONT MEAN A THING IT'S LIKE BANGING ON A DRUM EMPTY NOISE NO 
D'YOU REMEMBER DOWNSTAIRS THE DAY I MARRIED HIM 
DO YOU REMEMBER HIM STANDING IN THE BAR TELLING ME AND THE WHOLE OF WALFORD HOW MUCH HE LOVED ME 
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT SPEECH 
YEAH OH HE WAS GOOD VERY VERY GOOD HE EVEN CONVINCED HIMSELF 
D'YOU REMEMBER HOW HE WIPED THAT TEAR AWAY FROM HIS EYE 
YEAH 
WELL IT WAS AN ACT FRANK WAS A SHOWMAN 
HE LIKED PEOPLE LOOKING AT HIM HE LOVED TO HEAR THE SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE 
HE ENJOYED TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR MAKING THEM LAUGH MAKING THEM CRY 
BUT THE MINUTE THEY WERE OUT OF HIS LINE OF VISION HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT THEM 
HE DIDN'T LOVE ME 
AND HE DIDN'T LOVE YOU 
HE WASN'T WORTH THE TIME EITHER ONE OF US SQUANDERED ON HIM 
PERHAPS HE WAS A WASTER 
IN SOME WAYS A NO GOOD SON OF A. 
CLEVER MAN THOUGH OH YEAH YEAH HE WAS CLEVER ALL RIGHT 
ALL DUE RESPECT PEGGY I DON'T THINK HE WAS EVER COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU 
OH TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW 
NO HE DIDN'T LET YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS THINKING 
NO OFFENCE PEGGY BUT I DON'T THINK HE SAW YOU AS HIS EQUAL I BEG YOUR PARDON 
WELL WE JUST SAID IT DIDN'T WE HE WAS A CLEVER MAN EASILY BORED YOU TELLING ME I'M STUPID 
I THINK HE PREFERRED SOMEBODY TO KEEP UP WITH HIM YOU WHAT SOMEBODY SHARP AND THAT WAS YOU 
YOU SAID IT ME AND FRANK CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH WE UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER 
YOU'LL BE TELLING ME HE WANTED YOU FOR YOUR MIND 
WE WERE SOUL MATES 
WILL YOU LISTEN TO YOURSELF YOU STUPID FAT OLD TART
