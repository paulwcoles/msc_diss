WE MIGHT NOT FIND THEM A DREAM PROPERTY BUT AS YET WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED 
I'M REALLY SO THIS BIT THE PEOPLE AT HOME WILL KNOW WHAT THIS BIT'S SUPPOSED TO BE 
AND THEY WILL BE LET DOWN IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN 
COME ON WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WE'RE GOING TO FIND THEM HOUSES 
AND HOW DO YOU DO IT I AM GOING TO HAVE A CHAT WITH THE LOCAL PEOPLE 
ALL RIGHT AND WHAT DO I ALWAYS DO 
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHAT WITH A LOVELY LOCAL ESTATE AGENT 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO SHALL WE GO AND DO IT 
YES O. K. NOW FOCUS KRISTIAN WHAT'S LICHFIELD LIKE WELL IT'S IN THE HEART OF ENGLAND 
AND IT WAS FOUNDED BY THE ROMANS 
THE QUINTESSENTIAL FOCAL POINT OF THE CITY IS THIS SUPERLATIVE 
EIGHT HUNDRED YEAR OLD MEDIEVAL CATHEDRAL WITH THREE SPLENDIFEROUS SPIRES 
THE CITY IS ALSO CELEBRATED AS THE BIRTHPLACE OF 
DOCTOR SAMUEL JOHNSON THE CREATOR OF THE WORLD'S FIRST DICTIONARY 
KRISTIAN YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'VE SWALLOWED A DICTIONARY 
OUR BUDGET IS ONLY THREE HUNDRED K. AND I DON'T THINK LICHFIELD CATHEDRAL IS EITHER 
ON THE MARKET OR WITHIN BUDGET DO YOU O. K. YOU'RE RIGHT NO BACK TO THE MATTER IN HAND 
RURAL STAFFORDSHIRE AWASH WITH BEAUTIFUL PROPERTIES 
AND VILLAGES WHICH ARE INSPIRATION AND ASPIRATIONAL BUT IN THE WORDS OF DOCTOR SAMUEL JOHNSON HIMSELF 
THE PLEASURE OF EXPECTING ENJOYMENT IS OFTEN BETTER THAN OBTAINING IT 
SO TO WHET YOUR PROPERTY APPETITE 
HERE'S WHAT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND WOULD GET YOU ELSEWHERE IN THE U. K. 
WELL THE SOUTH DEVON COAST WAS A MAJOR INSPIRATION FOR LITERARY GIANT 
AGATHA CHRISTIE BUT COULD STEVE PEN HIS FIRST BESTSELLER IN THIS IMMACULATE TWO BEDROOM 
THATCHED COTTAGE NESTLING IN THE DEVONSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE 
WELL HE MIGHT BUT HE'D HAVE TO SHELL OUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND FIRST 
MAYBE STEVE FANCIES HIMSELF AS MORE OF A BARBARA TAYLOR BRADFORD NOVELIST 
I RECKON HE'S MORE OF AN ALAN BENNETT MYSELF 
THEIR HOME TOWN OF LEEDS AND THIS DOUBLE FRONTED STONE COTTAGE 
COULD BE THE TICKET ESPECIALLY FOR JUST THREE HUNDRED K. 
BUT FINALLY IF STEVE WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW IN THE ERUDITE 
IF SLIGHTLY SAUCY FOOTSTEPS OF LADY CHATTERLEY'S CREATOR D. H. LAWRENCE 
THEN MAYBE THIS THREE BED VICTORIAN PILE IN THE AUTHOR'S HOME COUNTY 
OF NOTTINGHAMSHIRE WOULD PROVIDE RELEVANT INSPIRATION 
BILLED AS A TRULY CHARMING HOME BY THE ESTATE AGENTS 
IT'S NOT BAD AT ALL FOR THREE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND BUT CAN WE FIND SOMETHING 
LITERALLY LOVELY IN LICHFIELD 
I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON LICHFIELD 
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW IS FIND OUT IF THE PEOPLE OF LICHFIELD KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT LICHFIELD AS I DO 
HELLO MY NAME'S ED PLEASED TO MEET YOU 
HELLO ED I'M TRICIA HOW CAN I HELP 
TRICIA I HOPE YOU CAN HELP ME IN MANY WAYS WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT LICHFIELD 
WHAT'S IT FAMOUS FOR THE CATHEDRAL 
LET ME CHECK DOCTOR JOHNSON 
SHE'S RIGHT DOCTOR JOHNSON INVENTED THE FIRST DICTIONARY 
YES AND WE'VE GOT DARWIN HOUSE UP THERE 
HANG ON DARWIN HOUSE IS NOT ON MY LIST THEY WANT A LOVELY GARDEN THEY WANT TWO OR THREE BEDROOMS 
WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THE CATHEDRAL IT'S GOT THREE SPIRES 
AND THEY'RE CALLED OH I DON'T KNOW I'VE FORGOTTEN AS WELL THEY'VE GOT A GREAT NAME 
THE THREE LADIES OF THE VEIL I THINK THEY'RE CALLED OH RIGHT 
THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET EVERYTHING ON THAT WISH LIST 
BUT I HAVE GOT SOME THINGS THAT THEY MAY BE INTERESTED IN REALLY 
SO WE ARE ABOUT TO GO INTO MARKET SQUARE AND DO YOU KNOW WHY MARKET SQUARE IS FAMOUS DO YOU DO YOU 
I HAVE ONE HERE THAT THEY MAY LIKE 
BUT IT HASN'T GOT THE GARDEN ALTHOUGH IT IS IN A NICE WOODLAND AREA LOTS OF WALKS 
I TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID HE WOULD BE INSPIRED BY LOOKING AT A TREE 
DO YOU KNOW WHY THIS SQUARE IS FAMOUS 
IT'S DOCTOR JOHNSON ISN'T IT 
O. K. THERE'S ANOTHER REASON WHY IT'S FAMOUS NOT SO NICE NOT SUCH A NICE REASON 
IT WAS WHERE THEY USED TO BEHEAD PEOPLE 
YES AND THEY USED TO SOMETHING ELSE TO PEOPLE 
SOMETHING ELSE A VERY UNPLEASANT WAY TO GO BURNT AT THE STAKE 
THE LAST PERSON IN BRITAIN TO BE BURNT AT THE STAKE WAS IN THIS SQUARE IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWELVE 
THANK YOU I'VE BRIGHTENED YOUR DAY UP NOW AND YOU HAVE DO YOU FEEL GOOD LOVELY I'M SHARING THE LOVE 
IS IT MODERN OR IS THERE CHARACTER IN IT I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THIS 
IT'S MORE MODERN I WOULD SAY 
THEY ARE LIVING CURRENTLY IN MODERN 
RIGHT AND THEY WERE KIND OF UMMING AND AH ING ABOUT MODERN BUT IT'S AN OPTION I'D SAY 
WHY IS THIS SQUARE FAMOUS WELL IT'S WHERE THEY USED TO HANG PEOPLE ISN'T IT 
YES AND THEY USED TO DO WHAT ELSE TO PEOPLE IT TELLS YOU UP THERE 
EDWARD WHITEMAN OF BURTON ON TRENT WAS BURNT AT THE STAKE IN THIS MARKET PLACE FOR HERESY 
ON THE ELEVENTH APRIL ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWELVE BEING THE LAST PERSON IN ENGLAND SO TO DIE IN THAT MANNER 
IT WAS HERE ON THE WALL ALL THE TIME 
YOU KNOW I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT ALL THOSE 
INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT LICHFIELD BEHIND US IS THE VERY FAMOUS LICHFIELD CATHEDRAL NONETHELESS 
IT'S LOVELY IT IS LOVELY ALMOST AS LOVELY AS OUR THREE 
PROPERTIES WE'VE MANAGED TO SCOOP TOGETHER FOR OUR LOVELY COUPLE DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST OR SHALL I GO 
I WANT YOU TO GO FIRST BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SHOW YOU UP STRAIGHT AWAY 
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN HAVE A LOOK AT THAT THIS IS CHARACTER 
TATTOOED ACROSS A PROPERTY 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL NOW THE GARDEN OF THIS IS THE SELLING POINT 
THIS HAS THE GARDEN THAT WOULD INSPIRE STEVE TO MAKE THAT NOVEL WHICH WE BELIEVE IS WITHIN HIM

THIS IS BEAUTIFUL 
BIG ENOUGH BUT IT'S A COTTAGE ISN'T IT 
BECAUSE IT IS PERIOD AS THEY ASKED FOR THE DIMENSIONS ARE GOING TO BE SOMEWHAT SMALLER 
LET'S SEE IF THEY CAN COMPROMISE ON THAT 
THIS IS A COTTAGEY FEEL BUT GOT LIKE THAT MODERN THAT YOU DON'T FEEL TOO SCARED 
I JUST LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ROOM

MOST COTTAGES ARE DARK 
DID YOU BEND JUST FOR THAT 
I DON'T HAVE TO JUST ABOUT I DON'T HAVE TO 
THE CEILING IN THERE IS ABOUT SIX FEET THREE INCHES I'M ABOUT SIX FEET TWO INCHES AND THERE'S ABOUT AN INCH LEFT OVER 
HE'S A LITTLE BIT TALLER THAN YOU STEVE 
HE HASN'T GOT THE OLD THATCH SO I THINK I WIN IT ON THATCH HEIGHT

IT'S BIG ENOUGH YES ANOTHER HARRY POTTER CUPBOARD 
STORAGE SPACE I'VE GOT A REALLY NICE FEEL FOR THIS HAVE YOU REALLY HAVE YOU
