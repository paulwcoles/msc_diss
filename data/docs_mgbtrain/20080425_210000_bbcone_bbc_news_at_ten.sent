THIRD OF THE U. K.'S OIL 
IT'S IN RESPONSE TO THE PLANNED 
STRIKE AT GRANGEMOUTH THE REFINERY 
HAS CLOSED AND THERE ARE SIGNS OF 
FUEL SHORTAGES AS THE PUMPS BEGIN 
TO RUN DRY 
THERE'S NO DIESEL 
ANYWHERE THIS IS THE FOURTH GARAGE 
WE'VE BEEN IN 
DIESEL 
CAN'T GET ANY WITH 
UP TO A MONTH TO RESTART 
THE REFINERY THERE ARE PLEAS FOR 
BOTH SIDES TO STRIKE A DEAL ALSO 
TONIGHT POLICE CONFIRM THE BODY OF 
THE DISABLED MAN JAMES HUGHES WAS 
FOUND IN A SUITCASE IN HIS GARDEN 
AFTER THE TIBET PROTEST THAT 
FOLLOWED THE OLYMPIC TORCH CHINA 
AGREES TO MEET AN ENVOY OF THE 
DALAI LAMA 
THE NEW NORTH SLASH SOUTH DIVIDE LONDON 
AND THE REST OF THE U. K. AND THE 
TROUBLED SINGER AMY WINEHOUSE IS 
ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF ASSAULT 
NO PROSECUTION OVER THIS MAN'S 
DEATH THE NEIGHBOUR WHO STABBED 
HIM WON'T FACE TRIAL AND A CENTURY 
ON WE REVEAL THE FORGOTTEN HISTORY 
OF LONDON'S FIRST OLYMPIC GAMES 
GOOD EVENING THE PIPELINE THAT 
BRINGS ASHORE OVER A THIRD OF THE 
U. K.'S OIL IS SET TO CLOSE IN 
RESPONSE TO A PLANNED WALKOUT AT 
THE GRANGEMOUTH OIL REFINERY BEEN 
SAYS IT HAS NO CHOICE IF THE STRIKE 
GOES AHEAD MORE THAN SEVENTY PLATFORMS 
IN THE NORTH SEA WILL BE FORCED TO 
STOP PRODUCTION AT AN ESTIMATED 
COST OF FIFTY MILLION A DAY 
GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY IS CLOSED AND 
BUSINESSES AND MOTORISTS ARE 
FEELING THE FIRST SIGNS OF FUEL 
SHORTAGES AS THE PUMPS RUN DRY IN 
SOME AREAS 
HERE AT GRANGEMOUTH A DEFIANT 
MESSAGE FROM THE UNION THE STRIKE 
IS ON ALL THE APPEALS FOR THE TWO 
SIDES TO GET BACK AROUND THE 
NEGOTIATING TABLE ALL THE TALK OF 
ELEVENTH HOUR DEALS AND DOORS BEING 
OPENED WELL THAT'S JUST ACADEMIC 
NOW BECAUSE THE PLANT HERE AT 
GRANGEMOUTH HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN 
THE SMOKE FLUMES AND FLARES ARE A 
DECEPTION GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY 
HAS HALTED ALL PRODUCTION ONLY THE 
SYSTEMS REQUIRED TO KEEP THE PLANT 
SAFE ARE CONTINUING TO RUN 
THE WORKERS WHO HELD A MASS MEETING 
ARE FURIOUS AT PLANS TO END THE 
FINAL SALARY PENSION SCHEME FOR NEW 
EMPLOYEES THE COMPANY SAYS IT'S 
VITAL FOR THE PLANT'S FUTURE THE 
STAFF ARE DETERMINED TO KEEP IT 
WHAT WAS THE MOOD OF THE MEETING 
LIKE 
VERY GOOD 
DETERMINED TO GO LIKE AHEAD WITH THE STRIKE 
YES IT WAS 
VERY GOOD AND VERY GOOD ON THE 
MEMBERS' PART 
AND YOU'RE 
DETERMINED TO GO AHEAD WITH THE 
STRIKE 
IT'S NOT SO MUCH GO AHEAD STRIKE BUT THE COMPANY IS PUTTING US IN A 
POSITION WE CAN'T TURN THAT'S ALL 
I'M GOING TO SAY 
THE STRIKE IS 
THREATENING A NEIGHBOURING B. P. PLANT 
WHICH IS PREPARING TO SHUT DOWN THE 
PIPELINE BRINGING OIL DIRECT FROM 
THE NORTH SEA WHEN IT COMES IN 
FROM THE PLATFORMS OUT AT SEA THE 
CRUDE OIL IS CONTAMINATED WITH SAND 
WATER AND OTHER IMPURITIES WHICH 
HAVE TO BE SEPARATED OUT 
BUT B. P. RELIES ON GRANGEMOUTH TO 
HELP PROCESS THE CRUDE FROM THOSE 
SEVENTY PLATFORMS THE REFINERY PROVIDES 
THE POWER FOR THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILE PIPELINE 
SYSTEM IT CARRIES SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BARRELS 
OF OIL A DAY MORE THAN A THIRD OF 
BRITAIN'S OIL OUTPUT AND THIRTY PER CENT OF 
ITS GAS PRODUCTION 
THE OWNERS OF GRANGEMOUTH HAVE 
STEPPED UP THEIR IMPORTS OF FUEL BY 
SEA TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN 
MAINTAIN SUPPLIES DURING THE STRIKE 
THE ONLY TROUBLE THAT THEY ARE 
FACING IS IF THERE'S PANIC BUYING 
THEN THAT CREATES MORE OF DRAW ON 
THE SYSTEM THEY CAN COPE WITH THEY 
HAVE SEVEN TO TEN DAYS OF NORMAL 
CONSUMPTION BUT IF PEOPLE START 
FILLING THEIR TANKS IN EMERGENCY 
SITUATION THEN WE'RE LIKELY TO RUN 
OUT OF THE FUEL SOONER RATHER THAN 
LATER 
BUT AS THE STRIKE APPROACHES LATER THERE ARE SIGNS THAT GARAGE 
FORECOURTS ARE BEGINNING TO FEEL 
THE STRAIN WHILE OUTBREAKS OF 
PANIC BUYING ARE SPORADIC DRIVERS 
ARE FILLING UP THEIR TANKS MORE 
OFTEN LEADING TO TEMPORARY 
SHORTAGES 
THERE'S NO DIESEL SHORTAGES ANYWHERE THIS IS THE FOURTH GARAGE 
WE'VE BEEN IN NO DIESEL 
I STOPPED 
AT DIFFERENT GARAGES TO FILL UP 
BECAUSE YOU ONLY GET A CERTAIN 
AMOUNT EVERYWHERE 
SOME BUSINESSES 
ESPECIALLY HAULIERS ARE HOWEVER 
FINDING IT A STRUGGLE TO TRACK DOWN 
THE SUPPLIES OF FUEL ON WHICH THEY 
DEPEND DEPEND IT'LL TAKE WEEKS TO GET THE 
GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY BACK ONLINE 
BUT MINISTERS ON LINE BUT 
MINISTERS CONTINUE TO STRESS 
WITHOUT PANIC BUYING THERE ARE 
SUPPLIES TO 
IT IS A QUESTION OF CONFIDENCE 
DRIVERS ARE CONTINUING TO REPORT 
DIFFICULTIES IN GETTING HOLD OF 
PETROL AND DIESEL AND THERE ARE 
CONTINGENCY PLANS TO ENSURE THE 
EMERGENCY SERVICES DON'T GO SHORT 
ALL THE WHILE MINISTERS ARE 
REPEATING THE MANTRA THAT THEY HAVE 
MORE THAN ENOUGH FUEL WITHIN THE 
SYSTEM TO KEEP MOTORISTS SUPPLIED 
RIGHT THROUGH THE STRIKE PERIOD AND 
WELL INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT MONTH 
POLICE HAVE CONFIRMED THE BODY OF A 
DISABLED MAN WAS FOUND IN A 
SUITCASE IN THE GARDEN OF HIS HOME 
IN REDDITCH JAMES HUGHES' BODY WAS 
DISCOVERED ON WEDNESDAY HIS MOTHER 
HEATHER WARDLE HAD BEEN FOUND DEAD 
IN NEARBY WOODLAND TWO DAYS EARLIER 
TWO PEOPLE INCLUDING JAMES' 
STEPFATHER HAVE BEEN RELEASED 
AFTER QUESTIONING 
THIS WAS JAMES HUGHES IN TWO THOUSAND TWO A 
HAPPY GUEST AT THE WEDDING OF HIS 
FATHER PAUL 
SIX YEARS LATER THIS IS WHERE HE 
ENDED UP HIS BODY CRAMMED INTO A 
SUITCASE CONCEALED AMONG DEBRIS IN 
THE BACK GARDEN TERRACED HOUSE 
WHERE HE LIVED 
TODAY PAUL HUGHES PAID TRIBUTE 
IN A STATEMENT HE SAID 
JAMES' BODY WAS DISCOVERED TWO DAYS 
AFTER HIS MOTHER WAS FOUND DEAD IN 
UNDERGROWTH HALF A MILE AWAY 
HEATHER WARDLE HAD A LIGATURE 
AROUND HER NECK HER DEATH IS BEING 
TREATED AS UNEXPLAINED 
FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS HER PARTNER 
BRIAN KIRBY AND A TEENAGE BOY 
HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED BY THE POLICE 
ON SUSPICION OF MURDER BOTH HAVE 
NOW BEEN RELEASED WITHOUT CHARGE 
BRIAN'S OBVIOUSLY VERY UPSET AT THE 
EVENTS THAT HAVE UNFOLDED OVER THE 
LAST FEW DAYS IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY 
SHOKT TO EVERYBODY WHEN YOUR 
PARTNER DIES YOUR STEPSON DIES 
ESPROTESTED HIS INNOCENCE AND THE 
POLICE HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE NO 
FURTHER ACTS 
DID YOU KNOW HEATHER 
AND USED TO USE THE WHEELCHAIR 
WITH FEW FACTS TO GO ON THE POLICE 
HAVE BEEN TURNING TO THE PUBLIC FOR 
HELP IN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHEN 
JAMES WAS LAST ACTUALLY SEEN ALIVE 
BUT DESPITE A PAINSTAKING 
INVESTIGATION WHAT HAPPENED HERE 
AT LOXLEY CLOSE STILL REMAINS 
UNCLEAR THE PROBLEM FOR DETECTIVES 
IS THAT THE BODY DISCOVERED HERE 
WAS SO BADLY DECOMPOSED THAT EVEN 
THE POST MORTEM EXAMINATION HAS 
FAILED TO ESTABLISH HOW JAMES 
HUGHES DIED AND EXACTLY WHEN 
WITHOUT THAT CRUCIAL INFORMATION 
THIS COMPLICATED CASE IS PROVING 
DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE 
CHINA HAS AGREED TO MEET AN ENVOY 
OF THE DALAI LAMA FOLLOWING THE 
WAVE OF PRO TIBET DRAIGTSS THAT 
HAVE ACCOMPANIED THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
AROUND THE WORLD CHINA HAS COME 
UNDER INTENSE INTERNATIONAL 
PRESSURE TO HOLD TALKS ABOUT THE 
FUTURE OF TIBET IN THE RUN UP TO 
THE BEIJING OLYMPICS 
THIS REPORT FROM BEIJING THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH ARRIVES IN JAPAN A 
BIT LIKE A VISITING HEAD OF STATE 
IT EVEN HAS ITS OWN RED CARPET 
BUT PRO TIBETAN DEMONSTRATORS ARE 
GETTING READY THAT MAKE THEIR POINT 
AS WELL 
PROTESTERS HAVE ALREADY INTERRUPTED 
THE TORCH RELAY CHINA ACCUSES THE 
DALAI LAMA OF SABOTAGING THE 
BEIJING OLYMPICS NO POINT IN EVEN 
TALKING TO SUCH A MAN CHINA HAS 
ALWAYS SAID UNTIL HE GIVES UP 
VIOLENCE BUT TONIGHT WITH A 
STRAIGHT FACE CHINA SIMPLY CHANGED 
TACK STATE T. V. SAYS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL NOW SIT DOWN WITH 
ONE OF THE DALAI LAMA'S ENVOYS 
THAT'S A WELCOME PIECE OF NEWS FOR 
THIS SET OF VISITORS FROM THE 
EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR WEEKS THE 
E. U. HAS CALLED ON CHINA TO HOLD 
TALKS WITH THE DALAI LAMA AND 
TONIGHT THE COMMISSION'S PRESIDENT 
GAVE US HIS FIRST REACTION TO THE 
NEWS NEWS TALKS DOES NOT MEAN AGREEMENT BUT 
IT REPRESENTS A VERY IMPORTANT 
PROGRESS I THINK IT'S FAIR TO 
REGULAR NICE THAT 
FOR CHINA 
EUROPE IS IMPORTANT TWO DECADES 
AGO CHINA AND EUROPE TRADED ALMOST 
NOTHING BUT BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SIX 
BILATERAL TRADE TRADE REACHED OVER 
TWO HUNDRED BILLION CHINA IS NOW EUROPE'S 
BIGGEST SOURCE OF MANUFACTURED 
IMPORTS WORTH OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION 
AND CHINA'S EUROPE'S FASTEST 
GROWING EXPORT MARKET MAKING FIFTY 
BILLION A YEAR 
WE HAVE A VERY DEEP 
AND IRREVERSIBLE ECONOMIC 
INTERDEPENDENCE AND A TRADE 
INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN CHINA AND 
EUROPE IT IS IN BOTH OUR INTERESTS 
FOR THIS RELATIONSHIP TO GO WELL 
BEIJING'S MOVE HAS GIVEN ITS 
EUROPEAN VISITORS SOMETHING TO TAKE 
HOME WITH THEM CHINA'S KEEN TO 
SHOW THE WEST THAT IT IS TAKING 
POSITIVE STEPS BUT HOLDING TALKS 
IS ONE THING REACHING AN AGREEMENT 
WITH THE DALAI LAMA IS SOMETHING 
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT 
LAST WEEK B. B. C. NEWS REPORTED ON 
PRICE FIXING IN THE HOUSE BUILDING 
SECTOR TONIGHT IT'S THE TOBACCO 
INDUSTRY THE OFFICE OF FAIR 
TRADING IS OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING 
WHETHER IMPERIAL TOBACCO AND 
GALLAGHER AND ELEVEN RETAILERS COLLUDED 
TO FIX PRICES 
ANYONE WHO LIKES TO LIGHT UP HAS 
QUITE POSSIBLY LOST OUT BECAUSE OF 
ALLEGED PRICE FIXING IN THE SUPPLY 
OF CIGARETTES AND OTHER TOBACCO 
PRODUCTS IT'S ALLEGED THAT 
CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS WOULD TELL 
RETAILERS HOW TO PRICE THEIR 
PRODUCTS FOR EXAMPLE MANUFACTURER 
OF BRAND X. WOULD TELL THE RETAYLOR 
THAT THE PRICE HAD TO BE THE SAME 
AS OR VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF BRAND 
Y. MADE BY A RIVAL COMPANY THE 
POINT BEING THAT RETAILERS' ABILITY 
TO DECIDE THEIR OWN PRICES WOULD BE 
RESTRICTED RESTRICTED THE ALLEGATIONS WHICH COVER 
THREE YEAR PERIOD ALSO SUGGEST THAT 
THE COMPANIES INDIRECTLY EXCHANGED 
INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR FUTURE 
PRICING PLANS 
AS A RESULT OF THE PRICING 
PRACTICES AS A RESULT OF 
ALLEGATIONS WE SAY ABOUT 
INFORMATION EXCHANGE THAT IT'S 
LIKELY CONSUMERS SMOKERS PAID MORE 
WHEN THEY BOUGHT THEIR CIGARETTES 
AT THAT PERIOD OF TIME GALLAGHER GALLAGHER AND IMPERIAL ARE THE MANUFACTURERS 
CAUGHT UP IN THE INQUIRY THE ELEVEN 
RETAILERS INCLUDE ASDA MORRISON'S 
SAINSBURY'S AND SHELL IMPEER JULY 
SAID IT'S REJECTED ANY SUGGESTION 
THAT IT'S ACTED CONTRARY TO THE 
INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS TESCO SAID 
THE INVESTIGATION APPEARED TO FOCUS 
ON MAJOR TOBACCO COMPANIES AND THAT 
ITS CONDUCT HAD NOT HARMED 
CONSUMERS IN RECENT MONTHS THE 
OFT HAS TARGETED THE SETTING OF 
MILK PRICES AND THE SCALE OF BILLS 
SET BY CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES THE THE OFT ARE BECOMING VERY ACTIVE THE 
OFT USED TO BE KNOWN AS ONE OF THE 
MOST BENIGN 
IN EUROPE L. WOULD SAY WE'VE 
REACHED A STAGE NOW WHERE THE OFT 
IS ONE OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE 
REGULAR LAIRTS IN EUROPE THE THE COMPANY WILL PUT THEIR CASE BUT IF 
THE OFT DECIDES THE ALLEGATIONS ARE 
PROVE IT HAS THE POWER TO LEVY 
FINES WHICH COULD RUN TO HUNDREDS 
MUCH MILLIONS OF POUNDS 
COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
THEY SPEAK GERMAN IT'S A GOOD 
MOANING FOR ALLO ALLO BUT WHY IS 
IT BEING TRANSLATED INTO GERMAN 
THE VOTE ON WHO WILL BE THE NEXT 
LONDON MAYOR IS LESS THAN A WEEK 
AWAY THE PRIZE TAKING CHARGE OF 
ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST DYNAMIC 
CITIES IT'S INCREASINGLY CLEAR 
WHERE THERE WAS ONE A NORTH SOUTH 
DIVIDE THERE'S A GROWING SOCIAL 
AND ECONOMIC DIVIDE BETWEEN LONDON 
AND THE REST OF THE U. K. FIRST 
HERE'S OUR HOME EDITOR MARK EASTON 
THE LIFESTYLE OF THE CAPITAL IS NOT 
THE SAME AS THE REST OF THE U. K. 
SOCIALLY AND CULTURALLY IT'S JUST 
DIFFERENT WELCOME TO PLANET LONDON 
THE LANGUAGE IS DIFFERENT OR I 
SHOULD I SAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY LANGUAGES LONDON 
IS THE MOST LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE 
PLACE IN THE WORLD A COSMOPOLITAN 
INTERNATIONAL CITY UTTERLY 
TRANSFORMED BY IMMIGRATION IN 
CENTRAL LONDON FORTY PER CENT OF THE 
POPULATION ARE FOREIGN BORN BEYOND 
THE CAPITAL IT'S JUST SEVEN HUNDRED 
HERE IT'S ONLY ONE IN TEN 
PENSIONERS LONDON IS BREEDING SO 
FAST THE CITY ACCOUNTS FOR HALF 
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY'S POPULATION 
GROWTH AND MOST OF THE BABIES ARE 
BORN TO FOREIGN MUMS 
HOW PEOPLE TRAVEL AROUND IN LONDON 
ISN'T THE SAME AS THE REST OF THE 
COUNTRY EITHER TAKE DRIVING TO 
WORK OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT 
COMMUTE BY CAR IN CENTRAL LONDON 
IT'S JUST ELEVEN PER CENT 
LONDONERS CYCLE MORE THEY WALK 
MORE DRINK LESS SMOKE LESS AND 
EAT LESS OBESITY IN THE HEART OF 
LONDON'S ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT ELSEWHERE IT 
REACHES THIRTY PER CENT 
BUT LONDON IS A CITY OF CONTRASTS 
MORE BILLIONAIRES THAN ANY OTHER 
CITY THAN THAN NEW YORK BUT IT'S 
BANG NEXT DOOR TO BRITAIN'S POOREST 
IN CENTRAL LONDON MORE THAN HALF 
THE CHILDREN LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY 
LINE ALMOST TWICE THE PROPORTION 
IN THE REST OF THE U. K. AND LONDON 
CAN BE A DANGEROUS PLACE YOUR 
CHANCES OF BEING ROBBED ALMOST 
EIGHT TIMES HIGHER THAN THE REST OF 
THE COUNTRY ALMOST HALF THE 
ROBBERIES IN ENGLAND ARE IN THE 
CAPITAL LONDON IS IMMENSELY 
POPULAR ATTRACTING MORE VISITORS 
THAN ANY OTHER CITY CITY IN THE 
WORLD LONDON HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE U. K. 
BUT PERHAPS IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU LOOK 
AT THE CONTRAST IN THE STATISTICS 
THAT YOU REALISE JUST HOW DIFFERENT 
BRITAIN'S CAPITAL HAS BECOME 
BUT IS THE ECONOMY STILL THE 
DRIVING FORCE IN BRITAIN 
BRITAIN'S DONE WELL OVER THE PAST 
TEN YEARS BUT WITHOUT LONDON 
GORDON BROWN WOULD HAVE MUCH LESS 
TO BRAG ABOUT LONDON'S ECONOMY HAS 
GROWN A TURBO CHARGED THIRTY FIVE PER CENT A YEAR 
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN OUTSIDE LONDON GROWTH 
HAS BEEN A MORE HUMDRUM TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT 
AND THE ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS COME 
FROM DIFFERENT THINGS OUTSIDE 
LONDON A LOT MORE OF IT HAS COME 
FROM GOVERNMENT CASH 
LAST YEAR LONDONERS PAID NINETEEN 
BILLION MORE IN TAXES THAN THEY GOT 
BACK FROM THE STATE OUTSIDE LONDON 
THEY HOOVERED UP FIFTY ONE BILLION MORE 
THAN THEY PUT IN 
NOW YOU COULD SAY THE REST OF 
BRITAIN NEEDED THE PUBLIC SUPPORT 
BECAUSE LONDON HAD SUCKED UP ALL 
THE PRIVATE MONEY GOING PRIVATE 
INVESTMENT IN LONDON HAS RISEN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY PER CENT 
IN REAL TERMS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN OUTSIDE 
LONDON IT'S ONLY GONE UP BY ABOUT 
A HALF BUT THAT MAY BE ABOUT TO 
CHANGE CHANGE PUBLIC SPENDING ISN'T GOING TO SLOW 
DOWN AS QUICKLY 
WITH THE FALL IN THE POUND MAKING 
BRITISH GOODS LIKE THESE CHEAPER 
ABROAD COMPANIES OUTSIDE LONDON 
THAT STILL MAKE THINGS COULD BE 
ABOUT TO CLEAN UP 
WE'RE EXPECTING 
TO CONTINUE GROW FAST THE EXISTING 
STRONG MARKETS LIKE GERMANY 
SCANDINAVIA SPAIN ITALY WE THINK 
WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND IN 
ADDITION WE JUST STARTED TO GROW A 
BIT FASTER IN ASIA 
WITH A SLOWING 
GLOBAL ECONOMY BRITISH EXPORTERS 
MAY NOT GROW QUITE AS FAST AS THEY 
HOPE BUT ONE MESSAGE IS CLEAR IN 
ECONOMIC TERMS THE REST OF THE U. K. 
HAS BEEN PLAYING SECOND FIDDLE TO 
LONDON FOR A WHILE BUT THE BALANCE 
BETWEEN THEM MAY BE ABOUT TO SHIFT 
A TEENAGER ACCUSED OF MURDERING THE 
LIVERPOOL SCHOOLBOY RHYS JONES HAS 
BEEN REMANDED IN CUSTODY UNTIL THE 
END OF NEXT MONTH THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD 
WHO CAN'T BE NAMED BECAUSE OF HIS 
AGE APPEARED AT LIVERPOOL YOUTH 
COURT VIA VIDEO LINK RHYS ELEVEN WAS 
SHOT LAST YEAR ON THE WAY HOME FROM 
FOOTBALL PRACTICE AND 
THE PLANT WAS DESTROYED IN AN 
ISRAELI BOMBING RAID LAST YEAR 
BEFORE ANY INSPECTIONS COULD TAKE 
PLACE 
THIS PRESENTATION DESCRIBES A 
NUCLEAR REACTOR SYRIA WAS BUILDING 
SECRET SECRETLY 
IT'S A BOLD 
CLAIM AND SYRIA DENIES IT THESE 
C. I. A. PICTURES TAKEN ON THE GROUND 
ALMOST CERTAINLY BY ISRAELI AGENTS 
OPERATING INSIDE SYRIA PROOF SAYS 
THE C. I. A. THAT SYRIA HAD A 
CLANDESTINE NUCLEAR PROGRAMME IT 
WAS TRYING TO HIDE FROM THE WORLD 
THE C. I. A. SAYS THE DESIGN OF SYRIA'S 
PLANT MATCHES NORTH KOREA'S NOTE NOTE THE SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT OF VERTICAL 
TUBE OPENINGS OF THE SYRIA'S 
REACTOR ON THE LEFT AND THE KOREAN 
ONE ON THE RIGHT 
HERE IT SAYS IT 
IS PROOF THAT THE TOP NUCLEAR 
SCIENTIST ON THE LEFT WAS WORKING 
WITH HIS SYRIAN COUNTERPART ON THE 
RIGHT ISRAEL TOOK NO CHANCES ITS 
AIR FORCES CARRIED OUT A LONG TERM 
BOMBING RAID THAT FLATTENED 
WHATEVER SYRIA WAS BUILDING OUT 
THERE IN THE DESERT FOR THE C. I. A. TO 
COME OUT SO PUBLICLY WITH WITH THE 
SYRIAN AND NORTH KOREAN 
PROLIFERATION THEY MUST BE SURE 
THEY'VE GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME THE 
TROUBLE IS THAT DESPITE THIS 
APPARENTLY CONVINCING EVIDENCE 
IT'S HARD TO FORGET THE 
INTELLIGENCE BLUNDERS MADE FIVE 
YEARS AGO OVER IRAQ'S ALLEGED 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
REMEMBER U. S. SECRETARY OF STATE 
COLIN POWELL AT THE UNITED NATIONS 
AND HIS CLAIMS ABOUT IRAQ 
THE NEXT SUSOF POISONS AND TERROR 
IS NEW 
SADDAM OF COURSE TURNED 
OUT TO HAVE NO WMD AND NOW SYRIA 
SAYS IT'S BEING UNFAIRLY ACCUSED 
SYRIA IS WISE COUNTRY AND WE 
KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT LIVING IN 
FAIR WORLD SO ACQUIRING ANY KIND 
OF IN NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY IS 
DEFINITELY NOT IN SYRIA'S INTEREST 
TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND STABILITY IN 
THE REGION 
ERECTING STRUCTURES 
RELEASING 
THESE CLASSIFIED RELEASING PICTURES HAS UPSET THE UN WHOSE 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
TOLD BUT WASHINGTON BELIEVES IF IT 
SERVES TO SERVE DOWN NUCLEAR 
PROLIFERATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
THAT IS A PRICE WORTH PAYING 
IN ZIMBABWE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN THE LATEST 
POLICE CRACKDOWN POLICE IN RIOT 
GEAR RANSACK THE HEADQUARTERS OF 
THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE AND THE OFFICES 
OF ELECTION MONITORS AND TO BE PUT 
AWAY IN BUSES AND VEHICLES IT 
COMES A DAY AFTER THE U. S. ENVOY SAID 
THE OPPOSITION HAD WON LAST MONTH'S 
DISPUTED 
DISPUTED ELECTION AT LEAST TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED 
IN A BOMB ATTACK ON A RUSH HOUR BUS 
IN SRI LANKA THE DEVICE WENT OFF

AMY WINEHOUSE HAS BEEN ARRESTED ON 
SUSPICION OF ASSAULT THE AWARD 
WINNING SINGER HAS BEEN FIGHTING A 
PUBLIC BATTLE WITH ALCOHOL AND 
DRUGS SHE IS BEING QUESTIONED AT 
HOLBORN POLICE STATION IN CENTRAL 
LONDON DAVID SILLITO 
IS THERE SHE SHE IS ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST POP 
STARS AND YET HERE SHE IS IN 
CUSTODY POLICE HAVE BEEN WAITING 
TO FIND OUT IF SHE IS EVEN IN A FIT 
STATE TO BE QUESTIONED ABOUT WHAT 
ONE ALLEGATION IS THAT SHE HEAD 
BUTTED A MAN IN THE STREET 
SHE IS ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST 
STARS BUT BESET BY PERSONAL 
PROBLEMS TONIGHT AMY WINEHOUSE 
APPEARED TEARFUL AND DISTRESSED IN 
THE FEW SECONDS BETWEEN GETTING OUT 
OF HER CAR AND WALKING INTO HOLBORN 
POLICE STATION ON ARRIVAL SHE WAS 
ARRESTED AND LEFT TO WAIT A POLICE 
DOCTOR SAID SHE WAS AT THE TIME 
UNFIT TO FACE QUESTIONING 
THE SINGER'S PROBLEMS WITH DRUGS 
AND THE TURBULENCE OF HER PERSONAL 
LIFE ARE WELL KNOWN HER HUSBAND IS 
IN PRISON ON REMAND AT THE MOMENT 
FACING CHARGES OF GRIEVOUS BODILY 
HARM AND ATTEMPTING TO PERVERT THE 
COURSE OF JUSTICE BUT TODAY'S 
ARREST FOLLOWS AN ALLEGED INCIDENT 
IN THE EARLY HOURS OF WEDNESDAY 
MORNING IT IS CLAIMED SHE 
ASSAULTED THIRTY EIGHT YEAR OLD MAN DURING 
A NIGHT OUT AT THIS BAR IN NORTH 
LONDON ONE REPORT SAYS THAT 
SCUFFLE BROKE OUT AS SHE WAS 
WAITING FOR CAB ALL THAT HER 
SPOKESMAN SAID TODAY WAS THAT SHE 
WENT VOLUNTARILY TO THE POLICE TO 
ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ALLEGED 
INCIDENT THERE WAS NO WORD AS TO 
WHETHER SHE IS GOING TO FACE 
CHARGES IT LOOKS AS THOUGH SHE MAY 
BE AN OVERNIGHT BEFORE SHE EVEN 
FACES ANY QUESTIONS 
SHE MAY BE IN OVERNIGHT 
LISTEN CAREFULLY I SHALL SAY THIS 
ONLY ONCE ALLO ALLO ONE OF THE 
MOST SUCCESSFUL BRITISH COMEDIES OF 
ALL TIME IS BEING DUBBED INTO 
GERMAN GERMAN T. V. HAS BOUGHT THE 
SERIES AND IT WILL BE BROADCAST 
LATER IN THE YEAR SO HOW DOES THE 
HUMOUR TRANSLATE 
LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY SHE WILL SAY 
THIS ONLY IN GERMAN ALLO ALLO 
HAS BEEN BOUGHT BY GERMAN 
TELEVISION MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
AFTER IT FIRST AIRED IN BRITAIN 
TRANSLATION IS A LITTLE TRICKY 
GOOD MOANING BECOMES GRITTON MARDEN 
WHICH MEANS BIG STOMACH AND THE 
FALLEN MADONNA WITH THE BIG BOOBIES 
BECOMES DIE GEFALLENE MADONNA MIT 
DEN PRALLEN MOEPSEN 
THINGS HAVE 
DOUBLE MEANINGS IN ENGLISH AND IN 
GERMAN WE JUST HAVE ONE WORD AND 
ONE MEANING SO YOU HAVE TO GO IN 
ANOTHER DIRECTION SOMETIMES TO MAKE 
IT FUNNY 
A IRINA VON BENTHEIM IS 
BETTER KNOWN TO GERMANS AS THE 
DUBBED VOICE OF A WOMAN IN SEX AND 
THE CITY NOW SHE IS YVETTE FOR FOR GERMANS IT IS VERY HARD FOR THEM 
TO LAUGH ABOUT THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
WE ALL FEEL AS IF WE WERE THE BAD 
ONES 
UNTIL RECENTLY THE VERY IDEA ONES OF ALLO ALLO BEING DUBBED INTO 
GERMAN FOR BROADCAST ON GERMAN 
TELEVISION WOULD HAVE BEEN 
UNTHINKABLE THAT IS BECAUSE FOR 
MANY IN THIS COUNTRY THE SECOND 
WORLD WAR REMAINS A VERY SENSITIVE 
ISSUE WAR AND COMEDY DO NOT MIX 
BUT THINGS ARE STARTING TO CHANGE 
LAST YEAR GERMANY'S FIRST FILM 
COMEDY ABOUT ADOLF HITLER MADE A 
SPLASH HERE AS FOR GERMAN STAND UP 
COMICS LIKE THIS ONE ON STAGE IN 
LONDON THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM JOKING 
ABOUT THE ZERO ABOUT THE WAR THEY THEY ARE NOT REALLY GERMAN 
THE END OF THE WAR IS SIXTY YEARS AGO 
THAT MEANS THERE IS A CERTAIN 
DEGREE OF DETACHMENT TO THAT TIME 
THAT MEANS IT IS MORE ACCEPTABLE TO 
JOKE ABOUT IT 
BUT WILL GERMANS 
LAUGH AT ALLO ALLO TO FIND OUT 
WE CONDUCTED A LITTLE EXPERIMENT 
THEY ARE NOT EXACTLY SPLITTING 
THEIR SIDES MIND YOU IT IS ONLY 
THE FIRST SHOW PERHAPS AFTER EIGHTY FIVE 
EPISODES GERMAN VIEWERS WILL BE 
LAUGHING ALONG WITH THE REST OF US 
THERE IS MORE NATIONAL AND 
INTERNATIONAL NEWS ON THE B. B. C. NEWS
