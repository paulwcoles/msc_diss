PSYCHOLOGICAL EDGE GOING INTO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 
SIR ALEX 
FERGUSON THE MOST SUCCESSFUL 
MANCHESTER UNITED MANAGER EVER HE 
HAS WON EVERYTHING EIGHTEEN MAJOR 
HONOURS IN A LONG DISTINGUISHED 
CAREER CAREER AVRAM GRANT IS HE ON THE BRINK OF 
BECOMING CHELSEA'S MOST SUCCESSFUL 
MANAGER HE HAS TAKEN THE BLUES TO 
THEIR FIRST EVER CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
FINAL UNITED DUBBED THE 
ENTERTAINERS VERSUS THE GRAFTERS 
BUT CHELSEA HAVEN'T ALWAYS HAD A 
PRAGMATIC APPROACH IN THE SIXTIES AND 
SEVENTIES THEY WERE RENOWNED TPOEUR THEIR 
STYLE MCCREADDIE STYLE MCCREADDIE TOMMY DOHERTY'S YOUNG ENTERTAINS 
KICKSTARTED THEIR MOST SUCCESSFUL 
SPELL WHICH BROUGHT THE LEAGUE CUP 
F. A. CUP AND THE CUP WINNERS' CUP TO 
STAMFORD BRIDGE 
THE WHOLE OF THE STADIUM RISES TO 
CHELSEA THE NEW HOLDERS OF THE 
EUROPEAN CUP WINNERS CUP IN IN RECENT YEARS MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE 
BEEN TAKING ALL THE PLAUDITS THE 
LION'S SHARE OF THIS SEASON'S GOALS 
FROM COME FROM ARGUABLY THE MOST 
ENTERTAINING PLAYER IN THE WORLD 
INCLUDING TWO IN THEIR LAST OUTING 
AGAINST WEST HAM 
NOT BAD IS HE 
YEAH HE IS NOT BAD OUTSTANDING 
PLAYER BRILLIANT BEST PLAYER IN 
THE WORLD TEMPT AS WELL AS LAST 
YEAR AT THE MOMENT AS WELL AS 
LAST YEAR HE IS THE TYPE OF PLAYER 
PEOPLE WANT TO PLAY TO WATCH PLAYS 
WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE AND A GOOD 
LAD AS WELL WHICH IS VITAL 
CHELSEA HAVE BEEN MORE BUSINESS 
LIKE GRANT'S PREDECESSOR MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN MR. CHARISMA OFF THE PITCH 
PITCH BUT WAS CRITICISED FOR HIS 
PRAGMATIC APPROACH ON IT ALTHOUGH 
THE CHARACTERS DIFFER IT'S FAIR TO 
SAY THE STYLE HASN'T 
MAN UNITED 
ARE THE ONES THAT ARE ENTERTAINING 
YOU WOULD SWITCH ON TO WATCH THEM 
PLAY I WOULD PAY TO WATCH THEM 
PLAY CHELSEA ARE MORE DOW BUT THEY 
GO ABOUT THE JOB IN A PROFESSIONAL 
MANNER YOU KNOW IN THE WAY THEY 
PLAY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE 
CHANCES AND THEY'LL GET THE JOB 
DONE AT LEAST THE MAN UNITED BOYS 
KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE GOING ON 
DOWN AT STAMFORD BRIDGE 
YOU HAVE 
TO TAKE YOUR HAT OFF TO BOTH TEAMS 
WHICH EVER WAY THEY DO IT CHELSEA 
HAVE ONLY LOST THREE GAMES AND 
THEY'RE GOING INTO SUNDAY'S GAME AS 
THE UNDERDOGS BECAUSE OF THE GOAL 
DIFFERENCE THAT THEY'RE GOING HEAD 
TO HEAD IN THE PREUPLIER LEAGUE AND 
CHAMPIONS PREMIER LEAGUE AND 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE THEY'VE 
FASCINATING TEAMS BOTH WAYS WHEN 
YOU PLAY AGAINST THEM YOU ARE 
PLAYING AGAINST ARGUABLY THE BEST 
TEAMS IN THE WORLD HOWEVER YOU DO 
IT STYLES ARE CONTRASTING BUT 
THEY'RE FASCINATING TO PLAY AGAINST 
EITHER SIDE 
WHEN GRANT TOOK ONLY 
CHELSEA WERE FIFTH IN THE TABLE AND 
IN DANGER OF GOING OUT OF THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IF HE TAKES THE 
TITLE RACE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND A FIRST EVER CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE FINAL YOUR JOB'S SAFE 
ISN'T IT 
I CAME HERE FOR MISSION 
TO TAKE THE CLUB THAT WAS ON THE 
WAY A GOOD CLUB BUT ON THE WAY 
DOWN WITH HELP PLAYERS STAFF AND 
EVERYTHING YOU CAN SAY WE ARE ON 
THE RIGHT WAY AND THAT IS ONLY 
THING INTERESTING ME 
WHOEVER IS 
REPLACING JOSE MOURINHO WILL BE UP 
AGAINST IT ALL OF US WILL TAKE OUR 
HAT OFF TO HIM AND SAY YOU KNOW 
WHAT IT IS HE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB 
AND KEPT HIS DIGNITY WHICH WE ALL 
LIKE HE HAS SHOWED REMARKABLE 
RESTRAEUPT AND LET PEOPLE 
RESTRAINT LET PEOPLE TALK ABOUT 
HIM RIDICULE HIM AND GOT ON WITH 
THE JOB AND DONE A FANTASTIC JOB 
WHATEVER HAPPENS OVER THE LAST TEN 
DAYS HE HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB 
AFTER TAKING OVER FROM SOMEBODY 
LIKE JOSE MOURINHO 
IN THE BLUE 
CORNER WE HAVE THE BATTLERS WHO 
HANDLED THE HARSH CRITICISM AND 
COME OUT ON TOP WRITE THEM OFF AT 
YOUR PERIL 
I ALEX SAY FEW MONTHS 
AGO THIS IS THE BEST SINCE HE WAS 
COACHING IF THEY TAKE IT WILL BE 
ON GOAL DIFFERENCE WHATEVER HAPPEN 
I AM PROUD OF WHAT WE DID IN THIS 
CLUB AND VERY PROUD OF THE PLAYERS 
IN THE RED CORNER THERE IS 
MANAGER WHO HAS WON EVERYTHING AND 
STILL HAS THE HUNGER FOR MORE AND 
ON THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
MUNICH AIR DISASTER ARE WE IN FOR 
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL 
IT MIGHT NOT BE KEVIN KEEGAN'S CUP 
OF TEA BUT WE ARE IN FOR A THRILL 
THRILLING FINISH 
I UNDERSTAND WHAT 
STEVE BRUCE SAYS HE IS INSULTED IF 
PEOPLE SAY HIS TEAM WILL LIE DOWN 
BECAUSE OF MANCHESTER UNITED 
CONNECTIONS HE WILL BE IN DRESSING 
ROOM GEEING THE PLAYERS UP L. 
BELIEVE WHEN THERE IS NOTHING 
RIDING ON THE GAME FOR WIGAN AT THE 
END OF THE SEASON THEY'LL GO IN 
THINK THEY'LL HAVE A GOOD GAME AND 
TRY THEIR BEST WHEN THE GOING GETS 
TOUGH AND THEY MIGHT GO ONE TO ZERO DOWN I 
CAN'T SEE THEM COMING BACK FROM 
THAT FAVOURITES ARE UNITED AND I 
THINK THEY'LL GET WHAT THEY NEED 
TODAY 
I AM OF THE SAME OPINION TODAY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IS REALLY GOOD 
TEAMS ARE REALLY GOOD TEAMS 
BECAUSE WHEN THEY NEED A RESULT 
THEY GET THE RESULT AT THE SAME 
TOKEN I THINK CHELSEA WILL BEAT 
BOLTON WITH MANCHESTER UNITED WE 
TALK ABOUT THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS 
JUST TO BORE EVERYONE THEY'VE SO 
MANY MATCH WINNERS ALTHOUGH ROONEY 
IS NOT AVAILABLE EVEN IF IT'S NOT 
GOING ON WELL AFTER AN HOUR YOU CAN 
STICK THREE ON AND THAT'S THE 
MANCHESTER UNITED WAY L. DON'T SEE 
THAT WIGAN BACK FOUR AND THE 
GOALKEEPER KEEPING UNITED OUT ALSO 
AS WELL COME TO TOMORROW I BET MORE 
THAN FIFTY PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE 
STADIUM ARE MANCHESTER UNITED 
SUPPORTERS SO WHILE IT IS AN AWAY 
GAME IT WON'T NECESSARILY FEEL 
THAT IT IS 
YOU HAVE BOTH BEEN 
INVOLVED IN FINAL DAY DRAMAS DOES 
IT BRING A DIFFERENT PRESSURE NO NO IT'S GREAT PRESSURE IF YOU SAY TO 
ONE AT THE START VERY LAST GAME IN 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE YOU CAN WIN THE 
PREMIERSHIP BY BEATING WIGAN AWAY 
WHOEVER SNAP THEIR HANDS OFF ALSO 
SAME THING WITH WHAT WE SAID 
REALLY GOOD PLAYERS ON OCCASIONS 
LIKE TOMORROW THEY STICK THEIR 
CHEST OUT AND GO THIS IS WHAT I AM 
HERE FOR AND I SHOW PEOPLE I AM A A 
GOOD PLAYER AND THEY BOTH HAVE 
THOSE IN ABUNDANCE EVERYBODY EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN BOTH CLUBS WILL BE 
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT THAT'S WHAT 
BIG PLAYERS AT BIG CLUBS LOOK 
FORWARD TO WHEN YOU GET YOUR 
CHANCE YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT AT THE 
MOMENT THE BALL IS IN UNITED'S 
COURT I THINK THAT THEY'VE GOT 
ENOUGH CERTAINLY IN RESERVE AS WELL 
AS TO COME OFF THE BENCH AND GET A 
GOAL WHEN THEY NEED TO TOMORROW'S TOMORROW'S GAME PUTS STEVE BRUCE IN AN 
INTERESTING POSITION THE WIGAN 
BOSS OF COURSE WON THREE LEAGUE 
TITLES AT OLD TRAFFORD HE WILL NOW 
BE HOPING TO STOP HIS OLD CLUB FROM 
BEING CROWNED CHAMPIONS BRUCE HAS 
BEEN SPEAKING TO DAMIEN JOHNSON 
I GUESS IT'S A NICE POSITION TO BE 
IN ISN'T IT GOING INTO THE LAST 
GAME SAFETY ASSURED AND A CHANCE 
TO INFLUENCE THE TITLE RACE IT'S IT'S BEEN UNBELIEVABLE FOR THE THE TOWN 
YOU KNOW IT'S QUITE FITTING FOR 
THE PLAYERS AND HOW WE HAVE DONE IT 
TO GET OUT OF THE TROUBLE WE HAVE 
DONE TO BE SAFE AND TO GO AND 
ENJOY THE OCCASION PEOPLE HAVE 
SUGGESTED THAT WE ARE GOING TO GO 
AND ROLL OVER I FIND THAT QUITE 
INSULTING REALLY YOU KNOW THE BEST 
THING ABOUT MANCHESTER UNITED IS 
THAT EVERYTHING THEY DO EVERYTHING 
THEY DO IT PROPERLY WE ARE NO 
DIFFERENT HERE WE TRY NOT TO BE 
DIFFERENT ANYWAY WE ARE PLAYING 
VERY WELL AT THE MOMENT AS VILLA 
FOUND OUT LAST WEEK AS CHELSEA 
FOUND OUT WE WILL GIVE IT OUR 
CHEST SHOT AND OUR BEST SHOT AND 
SHOULD BE A SPECTACLE ON SUNDAY 
BECAUSE MANCHESTER UNITED WILL KNOW 
THEY'RE IN FOR A GAME THAT'S FOR 
SURE SURE GOOD RUN BY VALENCIA HESKEY WANTS 
IT GOES TO THE OTHER TAYLOR WHO 
SMASHES IT IN 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SEASON YOU 
HAVE HAD IT'S BEEN A DRAMATIC 
TRANSFORMATION FROM DECEMBER TO NOW 
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN EIGHTH NINTH IN THE 
TABLE 
THERE WAS A TIME WE LOST TABLE HEAVILY TO BOLTON I AM DRIVING 
AWAY THINKING NINE POINTS FROM SIXTEEN 
GAMES WE ARE DOOMED UNLESS WE DO 
SOMETHING BRASS TICK TO GET 
DRASTIC TO GET THIRTY ONE POINTS SINCE THEN 
HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLE L. HAVE GOOD 
YOUNG PLAYERS REALLY GOOD 
GOALKEEPER I HAVE TWO EXCITING 
PLAYERS WHO HAVE TAKEN THE 
HEADLINES AND RIGHTLY SO BUT THE 
SQUAD I HAVE GOT IS DECENT 
IT MUST 
BE FRUSTRATING AS A MANAGER YOU 
HAVE A BIT OF SUCCESS IN TERMS OF 
AVOIDING RELEGATION AND PUSHING UP 
THE LEAGUE EVERYONE WANTS YOUR 
PLAYERS THEY'RE ALL IN THE 
SPOTLIGHT NOW 
THAT'S THE 
DIFFICULTY WE HAVE TO NURTURE THEM 
AND THEY GO ON TO BIGGER AND BETTER 
THINGS THAT'S LIFE WE DON'T WANT 
ANY OF THEM REALLY TO GO ANY WHERE 
CERTAINLY THE CHAIRMAN DOESN'T BUT 
WE ARE REALISTS TO KNOW IF THE BIG 
TEAMS COME KNOCKING AND OFFER YOU 
THE MONEY THAT THEY'LL HAVE TO 
OFFER BY THE WAY THAT'S THE GOOD 
THING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO 
CHEAP THEN YOU SHAKE THEM BY THE 
THE HAND AND WISH THEM LUCK IN IN THEIR PROGRESSION 
THAT ANOTHER YEAR HERE THEY'RE 
ONLY TWENTY TWO ANOTHER YEAR HERE FOR ME 
IN THEIR EDUCATION WISE IN FOOTBALL 
ARE MORE BENEFICIAL TO THEM BUT I 
AM GOING TO SAY THAT 
CAN I ASK 
ABOUT WHAT KEVIN KEEGAN SAID THIS 
WEEK THE PREMIER LEAGUE IS BORING 
HASN'T BEEN BORING FOR US AT SIX 
MONTHS BEFORE KEVIN WENT TO 
BIRMINGHAM AND GOT THAT RESULT I 
WONDER IF HE THOUGHT IT WAS BORING 
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANS 
USED TO CRITICISE SCOTLAND SAYING 
THERE WAS ONLY TWO TEAMS IN 
SCOTLAND NOW THE PREMIER LEAGUE IS 
BECOMING PREDICTABLE TOO CERTAINLY 
FOR ME IT'S THE BIGGEST AND BEST IN 
THE WORLD THERE IS ALWAYS FAIRY 
STORY LIKE OURS YEARS AGO WE FELT 
LIKE WE WERE IN THE FOURTH DIVISION 
TO BE FOUR YEARS IN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE COMPETING THE MIGHTY 
MANCHESTER THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT 
FOR US 
HE HAS MADE THEM A 
DISCIPLINED OUTFIT 
I HAVE A 
QUESTION WIGAN'S BEST SIGNING LAST 
EIGHTEEN SHOPBTS 
MONTHS 
YOU HAVE BEEN 
LISTENING TO HIM STEVE BRUCE AS 
HE SAID THE FIRST GAME BATTERED AT 
BOLTON GOT THIRTY ONE POINTS TOP EFFORT 
THAT IS 
HE IS ONE OF THEM MANAGERS 
AS A PLAYER YOU GO IN THE DRESSING 
ROOM AND YOU SIT DOWN LIKE THAT 
WAITING FOR HIM TO SAY SOMETHING 
HE HAS DONE IT ALL BEEN THERE AND 
HAS THINGS TO OFFER PLAYERS HE 
TREATS PLAYERS HOW THEY WANTED TO 
BE TREATED GIVES THEM A TELLING 
OFF AND PUTS THEM ARM AROUND THEM 
WHEN THEY'VE DONE WELL L. WOULD 
LIKE TO PLAY FOR STEVE BRUCE THERE THERE IS ALSO A BIGGER PICTURE IF PEOPLE 
THINK WIGAN ARE GOING TO LIE DOWN 
AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED I AM 
SURE STEVE PRIVATELY HARBOURS AN 
AMBITION TO MANAGE MANCHESTER 
UNITED TALK ABOUT PUTTING A MARKER 
DOWN 
FERGIE HAS BEEN PLAYING MIND DOWN GAMES SAYING BOLTON HAS BEEN 
CELEBRATING THIS WEEK L. SUPPOSE HE 
IS TRYING TO RILE THE OPPOSITION 
BOTH SETS OF MANAGERS ARE GOING TO 
SAY STUFF ON OCCASIONS LIKE THIS 
HE NEVER LET'S US DOWN HE HAS HAD 
A POP HE IS PREPARING HIS TEAM AND 
THROWS THESE REMARKS OUT L. DON'T 
THINK EITHER TEAM WILL BE BANG ON 
THE GAME AND THAT SUITS MANCHESTER 
UNITED BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE 
DRIVING SEATS AVRAM GRANT 
WELL THE BATTLE TO AVOID THE DROP 
FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE IS JUST AS 
INTRIGUING WITH FULHAM IN CONTROL 
OF THEIR OWN DESTINY IF THEY WIN 
AT PORTSMOUTH THEY'LL STAY UP IF 
THEY FAIL TO TAKE MAXIMUM POINTS 
BIRMINGHAM AND READING WILL BE 
LOOKING TO CAPITALISE IT'S BEEN A 
LONG HARD SEASON FOR ALL THREE 
TEAMS 
HIGHS LOWS JOY PAIN YES FOR 
READING FULHAM AND BIRMINGHAM IT'S 
BEEN EMOTIONAL AND IT'S NOT 
FINISHED YET 
MCBRYDE'S KNEE DISLOCATES DEFEAT 
TO WEST HAM LEAVES BIRMINGHAM WITH 
ONE POINT FROM THREE GAMES 
COME SEPTEMBER A SIGN OF READING'S 
DEFENSIVE FRAIL TEE TO COME A 
RECORD ELEVEN GOALS SHARED WITH 
PORTSMOUTH UNFORTUNATELY FOR 
READING THEY CONCEDED SEVEN OF THEM 
BIRMINGHAM'S FUTURE OWNERSHIP AND 
HIS OWN POSITION STILL UNCERTAIN 
THE MANAGER JUMPS SHIP IN MID 
NOVEMBER RESURFACING IN CHARGE AT 
WIGAN A FEW DAYS LATER THE SEASON 
OF GOODWILL WAS SOURED FOR LAWRIE 
SAN SHEZ SAN 
BIRMINGHAM DREW A LINE UNDER CARSON 
YOUNG'S PROTRACTED TAKEOVER BID AS 
THE YEAR ENDED BIRMINGHAM'S RUN OF 
EIGHT WINLESS GAME STARTS WITH DRAW AGAINST FULHAM 
READING SQUEEZED IN ANOTHER GOAL 
FEST 
FULHAM DEVELOPED A CARELESS HABIT 
AND COULDN'T HOLD A LEAD DEFEAT TO 
WEST HAM WAS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE 
SEASON READING FELL INTO THE 
RELEGATION ZONE AT THE START OF 
FEBRUARY BUT A WIN OVER BIRMINGHAM 
IN LATE MAFF MOVES THEM FIVE POINTS 
CLEAR OF DANGER WITH SEVEN GAMES 
LEFT HOWEVER THEY HAVEN'T SCORED 
SINCE MARCH BIRMINGHAM SUFFER 
AT THE START OF APRIL DAVID 
SULLIVAN AND KARREN BRADY ARRESTED 
ALLEGED OF CORRUPTION THEY DENY 
ANY WRONGDOING FULHAM FIND FORM 
AND THEY WIN AWAY AT READING 
BIRMINGHAM TUMBLED INTO THE 
RELEGATION ZONE AND HUMBLED FIVE TO ONE BY 
NEIGHBOURS ASTON VILLA TWO TO ZERO DOWN 
AND SEEMINGLY DOOMED FULHAM 
BREATHE AGAIN WITH A COME BACK AT 
MANCHESTER CITY ON THE LAST WEEKEND 
OF APRIL LIVERPOOL'S LEVELLER AT 
BIRMINGHAM AND FULHAM WIN OVER THE 
BLUES HOISTED THEM CLEAR OF THE 
ZONE FOR THE FIRST TIME ZIPBS 
BOXING DAY SINCE READING 
SWAPPED PLACES WITH THEM IT'S 
ABSORBING PRIME TIME DRAMA NOW 
FOR THE FINAL ACT 
BASICALLY I 
SUPPOSE TO USE THE OLD CLICHE WE 
HAVE BEEN DEAD AND BURIED FOR A 
LONG TIME BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE A 
CHANCE AT LEAST BY GOING IN THE THE 
FINAL GAME IT'S A TOUGH TASK FOR 
US TO BEAT PORTSMOUTH AT FRATTON 
PARK WE KNOW AND BUT WE HAVE TO BE 
HAPPY THAT WE STILL HAVE THAT 
POSSIBILITY 
WE ARE NOT IN CONTROL POSSIBILITY OF OUR OWN DESTINY THE ONLY THING 
WE HAVE IS SOME KIND OF SHAPE OVER 
THE WAY WE PLAY AND WE ARE GOING TO 
HAVE AN OPPOSITION WHO I THINK 
DERBY WILL BE DESPERATE TO WIN 
THEIR FINAL PREMIERSHIP GAME IN 
FRONT OF THEIR OWN FANS THERE WILL 
BE THIRTY THOUSAND ODD OF THEM IT IS DOWN 
TO US TO PERFORM TO GET THE THE 
RIGHT RESULT 
OUR INTENTION AT THE 
WEEKEND IS TO BEAT BLACKBURN AND IF 
SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS FOR US THEN 
IT'S THE FINE LINE THE EUPHORIA 
AND BEING VERY VERY DOWN THAT'S THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS 
WHO IS YOUR MONEY ON IN TERMS OF 
STAYING UP 
I'M GOING FOR 
BIRMINGHAM CITY BECAUSE I DON'T 
THINK YOU CAN EVER UNDERSTATE THE 
FACT THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES TO PLAY 
AT HOME SAINT ANDREWS ROCKING 
TOMORROW I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
BASICALLY IT'S A THREE POINT CUP 
FINAL IF THERE IS SUCH A THING YOU 
WIN THAT GAME AGAINST BLACKBURN WHO 
WILL BE TOUGH AND A REALLY GOOD 
CHANCE OF STAYING UP BECAUSE I 
DON'T THINK THE OTHER TWO WILL WIN 
I GOT A FEELING ABOUT FULHAM AND I 
THINK THEY MIGHT GET POINT 
PORTSMOUTH HAVE LOST THE LAST THREE 
BUT THEY'VE GOT SOME PLACES TO PLAY 
FOR THAT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT L. 
THINK THEY MIGHT GET POINT WITH 
BIRMINGHAM THEY'VE HAD A CHANCE AND 
BIG GAMES LIVERPOOL TWO TO ZERO UP AND 
LOST AND LOST AGAINST FULHAM EVEN 
THOUGH THEY ARE AT HOME THE 
PRESSURE MIGHT BE TOO MUCH THINK 
BLACKBURN MIGHT GET SOMETHING 
READING FANS WILL BE HOPING YOU 
WILL MENTION THEM AT ONE POINT BUT 
THEY CAN'T SCORE 
IT IS TWO SECOND MARCH 
THE LAST TIME THEY SCORED IN THE 
LEAGUE THAT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING 
YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS YEAR THEY 
HAVE CONCEDED A LOT OF GOALS QUITE 
OBVIOUSLY THE TWO DON'T GO TOGETHER 
YES WE KNOW IT'S DERBY YES WE 
KNOW THAT DERBY HAVE BEEN VERY 
VERY POOR THIS YEAR BUT IF YOU ARE 
IN THAT TEAM TOMORROW YOU WANT TO 
TRY TO FINISH THE SEASON ON A 
LITTLE BIT OF A HIGH THEIR 
SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC AND 
THERE HAS BEEN A BIT OF A WAR OF 
WORDS BETWEEN DERBY AND KEVIN 
DILLON WHICH WOULDN'T HAVE 
HAPPENED I BET WHEN STEVIE HEARD 
THAT THEY THOUGHT THANKS VERY MUCH 
THAT WILL REALLY HELP 
IF READING 
WERE GOING TO SCORE SURELY DERBY 
WOULD BE THE PLACE BUT WITH THIRTY THOUSAND 
FANS BEHIND THEM DERBY MIGHT GO 
OUT WITH A BANG 
IT WILL BE A NAIL 
BITING AFTERNOON TOMORROW SCORE 
WILL BRING YOU ALL THE TWISTS AND 
TURNS ON THE FINAL DAY 
ONE SIDE THAT CAN BREATHE EASILY 
DESPITE BEING ONE OF THE FAVOURITES 
TO GO STRAIGHT BACK DOWN FROM THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE ARE SUNDERLAND 
MANAGER ROY KEANE HAS IMPRESSED BUT 
ADMITS HE'S HAD TO LEARN QUICKLY 
WHILE IN THE JOB MATT ROBERTS HAS 
BEEN TO MEET HIM 
ROY KEANE A PICTURE OF CALM NOW 
YOU WANT WANT TO CROSS THOSE STEELY 
EYE NOW WOULD YOU IT'S BEEN YOUR 
FIRST SEASON AS PREMIER LEAGUE 
MANAGER HAS IT BEEN EVERYTHING YOU 
EXPECTED 
YEAH VERY VERY TOUGH I EXPECTED HAVE TO SAY WE FOUND IT VERY HARD 
BUT WE MANAGED TO STAY IN THE 
PREMIERSHIP NOW AND HOPEFULLY WE 
CAN LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES WE NEED 
YOUR APPROACH IS IN CONTRAST TO THE 
WAY YOUR PLAYING ACOOR WAS S. THAT 
FAIR 
MY PLAYERS WOULD DISAGREE FAIR BECAUSE THERE IS NO CALMNESS IN THE 
DRESSINGROOM AT HALF TIME AND AFTER 
GAMES I HAVE LOST MY TEMPER MANY 
TIMES BUT ON THE SIDELINE I TRY TO 
KEEP THE HEAD BECAUSE I HONESTLY 
THINK THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH YOU CAN 
DO YOU CAN MAKE CHANGES AND MAKE 
SUBSTITUTIONS BUT I DO TRY TO KEEP 
CALM BUT TRUST ME SOMETIMES IT'S 
VERY DIFFICULT 
WHAT IS YOUR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH NILE QUIEN I I SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT ONE A MONTH I'M 
NOT A GREAT TALKER IN TERMS OF 
SPEAKING TO EVERYONE L. WANT TO 
FOCUS AND WORK WITH THE STAFF AND 
HE DOES A GREAT JOB WITH PETER 
WALKER SO I'M LUCKY THERE IS NOT 
TOO MUCH POLITICS GOING ON 
HE HAS 
SPENT OVER FORTY MILLION THIS SEASON 
BUT HE'S AS UNCOMPROMISING AS EVER 
AND IN A SUMMER OF CHANGE EVEN BIG 
MONEY SIGNINGS COULD HAVE BEEN 
SHOWN THE DOOR 
I THINK I HAVE THE 
RIGHT IF PLAYERS HAVE TOOK THEIR 
EYE OFF THE BALL OR THEIR ATTITUDE 
IS NOT WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR A BIG 
CLUB WE MOVE THEM ON IT IS COMMON 
SENSE 
HAS BEING A MANAGER MADE YOU SENSE REALISE SOME THE MISTAKES YOU MADE 
AS A PLEAER 
PROBABLY I'M SURE I 
WAS VERY HARD WORK BUT HAVING SAID 
THAT I WAS ALWAYS A TEAM PLAYER 
AND I ALWAYS TRAINED AND PLAYED 
HARD I WOULD LIKE TO THINK ON THE 
MATCH DAY I GAVE IT BACK TO THEM 
WHAT YOU CAN'T TOLERATE PLAYERS WHO 
ARE GIVING YOU HEADACHES AND NOT 
GIVING YOU BACK ON A SATURDAY AND 
THEN YOU HAVE TO MOVE THEM ON 
THERE HAS BEEN LOTS OF PLUSES 
KENWYNE JONES FIRST YEAR REAL 
HANDFUL I'M SURE HE WOULD LIKE TO 
HAVE SCORED A FEW MORE BUT I'M 
SURE WE WILL SEE A MUCH BETTER 
KENWYNE JONES HE WILL HAVE LEARN 
WE HAVE LACKED EXPERT EXPERIENCE 
WHICH WAY DO YOU SEE THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP SWINGING MANCHESTER MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE HAD A LITTLE WOBBLE BUT 
IF YOU GAVE THEM THE START OF THE 
SEASON THEY WOULD TAKE IT ALL DAY 
LONG I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY WILL WIN 
ON SUNDAY THEY ARE A BRILL 
BRILLIANT CLUB PEOPLE LIKE PAUL 
SCHOLES DESERVE IT 
PAUL SCHOLES 
HAS EARNED DEMENTION FOR MISSING 
THE FINAL LIKE YOU DID 
IT'S A 
GREAT CHANCE L. HOPE HE DOES IT AND 
UNITED FANTASTIC CLUB L. LOVED 
EVERY MINUTE OF MY TIME THERE IT 
IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT FOR EX PLAYERS 
PARTICULARLY THERE TO MOVE ON 
QUICKLY AND ALL MY FOCUS IS ON OUR 
COURSE 
KEEGAN OBVIOUSLY HAS MADE COURSE THE REMARKS ABOUT BREAKING INTO THE 
TOP FOUR DO YOU AGREE WITH HIM 
IT'S THAT DIFFICULT 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THE 
PROBLEM IS THE TOP FOUR ARE 
QUALIFYING EVERY YEAR FOR EUROPE 
AND GETTING GREAT REWARDS AND BUY 
MORE QUALITY PLAYERS YOU HAVE TO 
BELIEVE THAT ONE DAY YOU CAN 
CHALLENGE THEM BUT TO CHALLENGE 
FOR US IS TO CHALLENGE THE TEAMS 
AHEAD OF US AND I WOULD PUT THE 
BLACKBURNS AND MANCHESTER CITYS AND 
THE BOROUGHS WHO HAVE FINISHED 
AROUND MID IT TABLE IS THE NEXT 
CHALLENGE WE ARE NOT LOOK ING TO 
CHALLENGE THE BIG FOUR NOT JUST YET 
HE BLENDED ALMOST SEEMLESSLY HOW 
IMPRESSED HAVE YOU BEEN 
SEAMLESSLY 
A VERY GOOD JOB AT THE SEAMLESSLY START OF THE SEASON YOU CAN ONLY 
AVOID RELEGATION HE SPENTS OVER 
FORTY MILLION BUT HE CAN RECOUP SOME 
OF THAT SPENT SOME PLAYERS HAVE 
MADE THE TRANSATION SOME HAVE BEEN 
AVERAGE AND YOU KNOW I THINK THING 
IS THEY WILL BUILD AND THEY ARE 
EXTREMELY WELL SUPPORTED IT'S A 
WELL RUN CLUB HE IS ALLOWED TO GET 
ON WITH THE JOB AND I THINK THEY 
ARE LOOKING TO FINISH TENTH AND THE 
STEADY PROGRESSION 
THEY COULD 
FINISH UP TO THIRTEENTH THAT WOULD BE A 
TESTIMENT TO NIALL QUINN AND ROY 
KEANE 
YES THEY WILL LOOK TO KEANE FINISH THE THE SEASON BY BEATING 
ARSENAL AND TRYING TO FINISH THIRTEENTH 
I THINK HE'S DONE A BRILLIANT JOB 
THE CHAIRMAN AND THE PEOPLE ABOVE 
HIM HAVE LET HIM GET ON WITH THE 
JOB HE HAS TO CONCENTRATE ON THE 
ELEVEN ON A SATURDAY THERE WAS A 
LITTLE BIT OF A POSITION THAT THEY 
COULD HAVE GONE DOWN BUT THEY'VE 
ALWAYS SEEMED SAFE TO ME THERE ARE 
A LOT OF TEAMS WORSE THAN THEM 
HE'S BEEN REALLY GOOD PERSONALLY 
BECAUSE HE HAS NOT RANTED AND RAIFD 
AND NOT GONE OVERBOARD RAVED HE 
HAS JUST KEPT REAL EVEN KEEL 
EVERYONE IS THINKING HE WILL 
EXPLODE AT THIS PRESS CONFERENCE 
AND HE HAS BEEN GOOD SUNDERLAND SUNDERLAND PLAY ARSENAL ALSO TOMORROW IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE EVERTON NEED A POINT 
TO CLINCH FIFENINGTH FIFTH 
LEE CITY COULD END UP IN EUROPE 
THEN SACK SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON IT'S 
UNBELIEVABLE GOINGS ON THERE THE 
FAIR PLAY LEAGUE FINISHING WHERE 
THEY DO AND GETTING INTO I DON'T 
KNOW HOW THAT SITS WITH ME TO BE 
HONEST I THINK IT SHOULD BE BASED 
ON ABILITY AND THERE SHOULD BE 
ANOTHER PRIZE DON'T KNOW WHAT 
BUT THE PLAYERS WON'T MIND THAT IF 
THEY GET INTO THE UEFA 
FAIR PLAY 
AWARDS LET'S HAVE BEST KIT AND 
GETTING INTO EUROPE WHAT IS ALL 
THAT ABOUT 
I'M NOT SO SURE O. K. O. K. WHAT ABOUT KEVIN KEEGAN AND HIS 
VIEWS 
I SUPPOSE HE GOT A TELLING 
OFF 
DO YOU THINK HE IS TALKING OFF HIMSELF OUT OF A JOB 
HE'S SAYING 
IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO BREAK 
INTO THE TOP FOUR BECAUSE THEY KEEP 
GETTING INTO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
AND THEY HAVE GOT THAT CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE REVENUE STREAM AND GO OUT 
AND BUY BETTER PLAYERS AND WE 
UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAYS BUT 
EVERTON DID IT AND I THINK 
EVERYBODY HAS TO STRIFE TO GET INTO 
THERE STRIVE 
HE'S HONEST AND HE 
COMES OUT AND SAYS THAT HE IS 
SAYING WHAT HE THINKS AND IT IS 
TRUE 
TALKING OF MANCHESTER CITY TRUE AND THE FAIR PLAY LEELING LEAGUE 
WHERE DO YOU THINK THE THAKSIN 
SHINAWATRA WOULD STAND RELEGATED RELEGATED AS WEST BROM AND STOKE PLAN FOR 
LIFE IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP PLAYOFFS BEGIN 
TOMORROW WATFORD TAKE ON HULL CITY 
AFTER GOING TOP THE KOP HORNETS 
SUFFERED A SLUMP IN FORM ONLY JUST 
MAKING THE TOP SIX 
WHILE IT IS CARNIVAL TIME IN PLACES 
LIKE WEST BROM AND STOKE FOR OTHERS 
THE HOLIDAYS ARE ON HOLD THE 
PLAYOFFS ARE SERIOUS AND FOR 
PLAYERS LIKE TOMMY SMITH IT IS 
BUSINESS MORE OR LESS AS USUAL 
WHAT IS THE MIND SET 
WE USE THAT 
EXPRESSION FOR A FOOTBALLER HITTING 
THE PLAY YOFZ WE ARE TRYING TO 
APPROACH IT LIKE ANOTHER LEAGUE 
GAME YOU KNOW DO YOUR HOMEWORK ON 
WHO YOU ARE PLAYING AGAINST DO A 
BIT OF TEAM SHAPE AND TEAM WORK AND 
TRY TO APPROACH IT LIKE A NORMAL 
GAME 
FROM WHERE YOU WERE LEADING GAME THE FABLE CLEARLY DOES THIS FEEL 
A BIT OF AN ANTI CLIMAX TABLE IT IT DOES IF YOU HAD SAID AT CHRISTMAS 
YOU WOULD FINISH SIXTH THEN WE 
WOULD HAVE SAID WELL THAT IS NO 
CHANCE OF THAT HAPPENING BUT IT'S 
THE WAY WITH THE SEASON WE HAVE 
FALTERED REALLY SINCE CHRISTMAS YO YO DO YOU THINK 
I DON'T KNOW TO BE 
HONEST WHY L. THINK IT'S DOWN TO 
OUR HOME FORM AWAY FROM HOME WE 
HAVE PRACTICALLY GOT THE BEST FORM 
IN THE LEAGUE WE WERE OPEN ABOUT 
WANTING TO FINISH IN THE TOP TWO 
BUT AS I SAID WE KNEW FROM TWO OR 
THREE WEEKS AGO THAT WOULDN'T 
HAPPEN OUR AIM WAS TO GET INTO THE 
PLAYOFFS WE HAVE DONE THAT WE ARE 
GOING TO MAKE SURE WE ARE CONFIDENT 
THE GAFFER WON'T LET US BE ANYTHING 
OTHER THAN THAT 
IF WE WON HALF OF 
THOSE GAMES AT HOME THAT WE LOST OR 
DREW WE WOULD BE ON HOLIDAY NOW 
BUT IFS BUTS AND MAYBES WE ARE 
WHERE WE ARE AND WE HAVE TO MAKE 
SURE WE MAKE THE MOST 
LOOKING AT 
THE STATISTICS ONE WIN IN FOURTEEN IT 
DOESN'T APPEAR GOOD FOR YOU 
NO IT 
DOESN'T I THINK WE WOULD BE LYING 
IF WE DIDN'T SAY WE WANTED FORM 
GOING INTO THE PLAYOFFS L. THINK 
EVERY TEAM WANTS THAT 
WE HAVE TO 
CREATE OUR OWN MOMENTUM AND YOU DO 
THAT BY BEING BOLD AND BRAVE AND 
HAVING A GO 
PEOPLE KEEP SAYING 
WOULD YOU RATHER PLAY AT HOME FIRST 
LEG I DON'T KNOW WITH THE HOME 
FORM IT IS A GOOD THING TO GET THE 
HOME TIE OUT OF THE WAY FIRST AND 
TRY AND GET A GOOD START L. FEEL IF 
WE CAN DO THAT WITH OUR AWAY FORM 
THEN WE ARE IN A GREAT POSITION 
WHAT ABOUT HULL WHAT PROBLEMS WILL 
THEY POSE 
THEY ARE GOING TO POSE A 
LOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE POWER AND 
PACE AND STRENGTH AND GUILE AND 
THEY HAVE GOT A STAFF THAT IS VERY 
ASTUTE IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT 
WE KNOW HOW GOOD WE CAN BE AND IT'S 
JUST CASE OF TRYING 
TO GET BACK TO 
THAT LEVEL AND HAVING THE BELIEF THAT YOU CAN GO ON AND WIN IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT IF IT WAS 
EASY THEN IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH 
COMPETING AGAINST WE LOOK FORWARD 
TO IT AND WE THRIVE ON 
CHALLENGE WE ARE ROLL ON SUNDAY 
THE PLAYOFF HAS ALREADY KICKED OFF 
CRYSTAL PALACE ARE AT HOME TO 
BRISTOL CITY LET'S GET THE LATEST 
FROM SELHURST PARK FULL HOUSE 
WARM SUNSHINE BUT NO GOALS YET A 
CAUTIOUS OPENING PALACE FOUND 
THEIR FEET WITH SHOT FROM BEN 
WATSON GOING OVER AND A YARDER 
FROM DANNY BUTTERFIELD AT THE 
OTHER END THERE COULD HAVE BEEN 
PENALTY THIS IS GARY JOHNSON'S 
FIRST EXPERIENCE AS MANAGE AND 
NEIL WARNOCK HAS A ONE HUNDRED PER CENT PLAYOFF 
SEMI FINAL RECORD TWENTY FOUR MINUTES IT 
IS ZERO TO ZERO THAT GAME IS BETWEEN TWO 
SIDES WITH REAL CONTRASTING 
FORTUNES IN TERMS OF GOING INTO THE 
PLAYOFFS WHO DO YOU FANCY OVER TWO 
LEGS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE GO FOR PALACE LEGS THE ONLY THING ABOUT THEM IS THEY 
HAVE GOT QUITE A FEW YOUNG PLAYERS 
YOU NEVER KNOW IN THESE SITUATIONS 
HOW IT IS GOING TO AFFECT THEM AND 
I KNOW EVERYBODY SAYS AND RIGHTLY 
SO THE TEAM THAT COMES IN IN THE 
GREAT RUN OF FORM GENERALLY GOES 
THROUGH I HONESTLY THINK ALL FOUR 
TEAMS AND HULL AND WATFORD IT IS A 
REAL TOSSUP L. REALLY THINK SO 
THERE IS NOTHING BETWEEN THEM FOR 
ME 
WITH PLAYING THE YOUNG PLAYERS ME THEY PLAY WITHOUT FEAR BUT WHEN 
YOU GET TO A PRESSURIED SITUATION 
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW THEY WILL REACT 
AND IT CAN GET THE BETTER OF THEM 
I THINK HULL TO GO OVER 
AND THE 
WATFORD GAME 
YEAH YOU KNOW 
WATFORD 
THAT IS THE HULL GAME 
THE PALACE GAME 
I THINK PALACE 
WILL GO THROUGH GOING BACK TO THE 
OTHER ONE I THINK WATFORD FEEL 
RELIEF GETTING INTO THE PLAYOFFS 
BECAUSE ALL THEY'VE ONLY JUST 
MADE IT 
THE LEAGUE ONE PLAYOFFS 
KICKED OFF LAST NIGHT WITH SOUTHEND 
AND DONCASTER SHARING A GOALLESS 
DRAW IN LEAGUE TWO DARLINGTON AND 
ROCHDALE PLAY WE ALREADY KNOW THE 
BLUE SQUARE PREMIER PLAY OFFFINAL 
IT WILL BE EXETER AND CAMBRIDGE 
EXETER WERE TWO TO ONE DOWN AGAINST 
TORQUAY THEY WERE AWARDED A 
PENALTY AND WATSON KNOCKED IT IN TO 
SQUARE IT UP THAT WAS ON AGGREGATE 
THEY CONTINUED THE COME BACK 
RICHARD LOGAN GRABBED A GOAL WITH 
WAYNE CARLISLE ADDING ANOTHER TO 
SECURE THEIR PLACE IN THE FINAL 
CAMBRIDGE UNITED JOIN THE DEVON 
SIDE FOR A CHANCE OF LEAGUE 
FOOTBALL AFTER THIS GOAL IN A FOUR TO THREE 
AGGREGATE TWIN AGAINST BURTON 
ALBION IN THE WEEK THE F. A. SET 
FABIO CAPELLO THE TARGET OF LEADING 
ENGLAND TO AT LEAST THE SEMI FINALS 
OF THE NEXT WORLD CUP OR EURO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO ONE OF HIS 
YOUNG STARS HOPING TO FULFILL THEIR 
AIM THREEIO WALCOTT WENT BACK TO 
SCHOOL AND MARK POUGATCH WAS WITH 
HIM HE HAS BEEN BACK TO HIS ROOTS 
TO WHERE IT ALL BEGAN AT HIS 
PRIMARY SCHOOL IN BERKSHIRE IN HIS 
ROLE AS AN AMBASSADOR FOR THE 
FOOTBALL FOUNDATION 
IT'S THE 
LARGEST SPORTS CHARITY IN THE U. K. 
THEO IS HERE TO PROMOTE THE SCHEME 
AND GO TO A FORM ON OUR WEBSITE 
FILL IT IN AND FOUR HUNDRED WILL COME TO 
YOU IF YOU ARE U. N. D. E. R. EIGHTEEN OR A SCHOOL 
TEAM 
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A KIT TEAM WHEN I WAS YOUNGER L. REMEMBER MINE 
IT IS PLAIN BLUE BUT YOU FEEL 
BETTER WHEN YOU RUN OUT IN A NICE 
KIT YOU COULD TELL THEY WERE 
LOVING IT 
IS IT FUN TO COME BACK 
DEFINITELY AND SEE PICTURES SOME SOME PEOPLE CAN'T STAND LOOKING AT OLD 
PHOTOGRAPHS 
I'M ALL RIGHT WITH IT PHOTOGRAPHS I WAS A LITTLE CUTEY SO I DON'T 
MIND AT ALL THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT 
BECAUSE I'M ENGLISH 
LET'S TALK 
ABOUT THE END OF THE SEASON 
EVERYONE WASN'T THINKING MUCH OF 
ARSENAL WHICH IS A BIT RIDICULOUS 
WE HAVE PROVED A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WRONG AND TAKE THE EXPERIENCE WE 
HAVE GOT THIS YEAR INTO NEXT YEAR 
AND WIN TROPHIES OF THE 
HOW DOW 
THINK YOUR SEASON HAS BEEN ARE YOU 
PLEASED WITH IT 
IT'S BEEN UP AND 
DOWN FOR ME QUITE A LOT OF THINGS 
HAVE BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY CERTAIN 
THINGS THAT HAPPENED L. L. WOULD LIKE 
TO HAVE STARTED MORE GAMES BUT I 
WANT TO TAKE COMING OFF THE BENCH 
PEOPLE HAVE MADE LOT THAT YOU 
HAVEN'T BEEN AFRAID ON AT LEAST ONE 
OCCASION OF KNOCKING ON HIS DOOR 
AND SAYING WHY AREN'T I STARTING 
DO YOU FEEL YOU CAN HAVE THAT 
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM 
YOU CAN TALK 
TO HIM IT WAS DIFFICULT AND I WAS 
ONLY YOUNG SO I HAD TO SORT I 
SPOKE TO MY FAMILY AND MY AGENT 
JUST TO BE SURE WHAT TO SAY BUT 
YES HE WAS BRILLIANT AND WANTED ME 
TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE AND NOT 
KICKING PLAYERS THAT'S NOT ME 
WHAT ABOUT FABIO CAPELLO EVERYONE EVERYONE HAS A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HIM AND 
THE STAFF IT'S GOOD FOR ME THAT I 
HAD EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD CUP 
HE'S A BRILL YAPT MAN TO WORK WITH 
HOPEFULLY I HAVE TO PLAY WELL FOR 
ARSENAL TO WORK WITH HIM AND I WILL 
DO THAT HOPEFULLY 
YOU FEEL QUITE 
CONFIDENT WITH ENGLAND IN THE 
FUTURE WHEN WE START THE QUALIFIERS 
IN THE AUTUMN 
HOPEFULLY IN 
TRAINING IT WAS SHARP AS ANYTHING 
HE WANTS US TO PLAY FOOTBALL THAT 
IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO HOPEFULLY WE 
TAKE IT INTO THE WORLD CUP 
CAN TAKE IT INTO THE WORLD CUP QUALIFIERS 
FIRST ABOUT THE ARSENAL STRIKER 
FABIO SAYS HE IS GOING TO USE HIM 
AS AN IMPACT PLAYER IS THAT THE 
BEST WAY FOR THEO 
POSSIBLY AT THE 
MOMENT THE WORLD CUP TWO YEARS AGO 
WAS TOO SOON FOR HIM HE WAS NOT 
HIM BUT CRITICISED FOR PUTTING HIM 
IN THE SQUAD HIS DEVELOPMENT SINCE 
THEN HAS BEEN SLOW ARSENE WENGER 
HAS BEEN LOOKING AFTER HIM THINKS 
HE IS GOING TO BE A STRIKER 
PLAYING HIM ON THE WINGS NOW AND 
AGAIN TOWARDS END OF THE SEASON 
PLAY PLAYING GETTING BETTER L. 
THINK HE IS GOING TO BE AN 
EXCEPTIONAL PLAYER HE HAS A GREAT 
ATTITUDE LOVELY KID HE HAS THE 
SPEED THE ABILITY HE NEEDS 
NURTURING FROM FABIO CAPELLO'S 
POINT OF VIEW HE IS GREAT TO HAVE 
IN THE SQUAD AND YEAH USE HPL AS 
OFTEN HIM AS OFTEN AS HE NEEDS I I THINK NEXT SEASON IS BIG FOR HIM 
HE HAS NOT BEEN USED THAT REGULARLY 
BY ARSENE WENGER WHAT IS HE WE ARE 
NOT STILL SURE L. DON'T THINK HE IS 
GOOD ENOUGH AT THE MOMENT TO PLAY 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE FOR ARSENAL 
THAT'S BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY RAISE 
THE BAR WITH THE THE STANDARD L. 
THINK HE WILL BE NEXT SEASON IS A 
MASSIVE SEASON HE HAS TO KICK ON 
WHEN YOU LISTEN TO HIM SEE HIM 
INTERVIEWED HE IS A DIFFERENT LAD 
HE LOOKS LIKE HE HAS GROWN UP THE 
PENNY'S DROPPED NO DOUBT ABOUT 
THAT 
YOUNG PLAYERS WHEN THEY GET THAT TO NINETEEN TWENTY HE SAYS WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
THEM BEING MENTALLY STRONG AND 
WHETHER YOU CAN COPE AT A BIG CLUB 
SO NEXT YEAR IS A BIG YEAR FOR HIM 
THE F. A. SETTING ITS TARGETS TO REACH 
AT LEAST SEMI FINALS OF LEADING 
TOURNAMENTS DOES THAT PUT MORE 
PRESSURE ON FABIO CAPELLO 
NO HE 
WILL HAVE KNOWN THAT ALREADY WITH 
SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON GETTING TO THE 
QUARTER FINALS WELL IN GOLFING 
PARLANCE PROBABLY PAR WITH FABIO 
CAPELLO IT'S THE NEXT STEP HE HAS 
TO RID THE ENGLISH PLAYERS OF THE 
MENTALITY THEY THINK THEY CAN WIN 
EVERY COMPETITION FORGET ABOUT 
THAT AND PERFORM TOURNAMENT 
FOOTBALL IS DIFFERENT FROM 
QUALIFICATIONS COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT 
DO THE F. A. HAVE TO SET DIFFERENT TARGETS LIKE THAT I DON'T 
UNDERSTAND JUST PUT THE SQUAD 
TOGETHER YOU HAVE ONE OF THE BEST 
MANAGERS IN THE WORLD GO AND 
PERFORM AND ACHIEVE WHAT YOU CAN 
WITH THIS GROUP SETTING TARGETS 
YOU ARE SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR A 
FALL 
THE PRESS LOST IT FALL NOW ARSENAL LADIES ARE CELEBRATING 
AFTER AFTER BEATING LEEDS IN THE F. A. 
CUP FINAL KELLY SMITH SCORED THE 
FIRST WITH A NIFTY FLICK SANDERSON 
CONTINUED HER SCORING FORM THE 
GAME FINISHED FOUR TO ONE TO ARSENAL 
THEY'VE WON TWENTY NINE TROPHIES IN SIXTEEN YEARS 
IN SCOTLAND RANGERS ARE ON ON 
COURSE FOR THE QUADRUPLE THEY 
RETURNED TO FORM WITH WIN OVER 
MOTHERWELL THAT MEANS THEY'RE FOUR 
POINTS OFF LEADERS CELTIC WITH TWO 
GAMES IN HAND 
POINTS OFF LEADERS CELTIC WITH TWO GAMES IN HAND 
GAMES IN HAND NEXT WEEK THEY TAKE ON ZENIT SAINT 
PETEERING'SBURG PETERSBURG 
HE IS AN EXPERIENCED COACH HE 
KNOWS WHAT IT'S ABOUT HE LIKE 
MYSELF HAD A GOOD LAUGH TO SEE 
WHICH OF THE TWO OF US WOULD WANT 
TO WIN MORE DON'T THINK WOULD BE 
MUCH BETWEEN THAT IF WE TAKE 
EUROPEAN SEASON AND WE PLAYED 
AGAINST TEAMS OF 
AGAINST TEAMS OF 
GOOD QUALITY IF 
YOU LOOK AT BARCELONA AND LYON AND 
STUTTGART SO WE PLAYED STRONG 
TEAMS THIS SEASON OBVIOUSLY WE 
HAVE HAD VARYING RESULTS CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE WISE BUT WE HAVE BEEN UP 
AGAINST STRONG TEAMS OVER THE 
SEASON SO I WOULD EXPECT ZENIT TO 
BE OF A SIMILAR STANDARD TO THE 
TEAMS PLAYED IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
SHOULD BE A TREMENDOUS LEAGUE OCCASION AT EASTLANDS WHO IS YOUR 
MONEY ON 
I SAW ZENIT SAINT 
PETEERINGBURG DESTROY 
MONEY ON PETEERINGBURG DESTROY 
PETERSBURG 
PETEERINGBURG DESTROY PETERSBURG DESTROY BAYERN MUNICH PLAY ON THE 
BREAK RANGERS 
I THINK RANGERS AS 
WELL THEY MIGHT LOSE THE LEAGUE L. 
THINK CELTIC ARE GOING TO NICK IT 
OFF THEM THAT'S WHAT I THINK 
INTERESTING RANGERS RELENTLESS 
FIXTURE BATTLE CONTINUES TODAY 
THEY'VE ALREADY KICKED OFF AGAINST 
A DUNDEE UNITED SIDE BATTLING FOR 
THIRD PLACE IT'S TWO TO ZERO NOW I AM HEARING 
THIS TIME NEXT WEEK CARDIFF CITY 
AND PORTSMOUTH WILL BE UNDER THE 
FAMOUS ARCH AT WEMBLEY TO CONTEST 
THIS YEAR'S F. A. CUP FINAL ALTHOUGH 
THEIR RECENT FORM HAS BEEN POOR 
THE ASSIST AND MANAGER IS CONFIDENT 
OF SUCCESS 
ONE GOAL AND ONE POINT FROM FOUR 
MATCHES IS NOT THE FORM YOU WOULD 
WANT GOING INTO ARGUABLY YOUR 
BIGGEST GAME IN NEARLY SEVENTY YEARS SO 
SEVEN DAYS FROM THE F. A. CUP FINAL 
ARE PORTSMOUTH FEELING THE STRAIN 
AN ABSOLUTELY AWFUL GOAL FOR 
PORTSMOUTH TO CONCEDE 
I THINK IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO 
FOCUS THE GUYS AND KEEP THEM 
CONCENTRATED ON THE LEAGUE THERE 
IS AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM YOU 
KNOW AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO SPEAK 
ABOUT IT AND BRING IT IT IN AND 
TALK AND MAKE EVERYBODY AWARE OF IT 
YOU KNOW THIS IS ALL WE CAN DO AT 
THE MOMENT IS TO PLAY AGAINST 
FULHAM MAN CITY WHOEVER IT MIGHT 
BE BUT THERE IS AN ELEPHANT IN THE 
ROOM IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO 
KEEP THEM FOCUSED AND CONCENTRATED 
SOME OF THESE PLACERS WILL NEVER BE 
IN THIS SITUATION EVER AGAIN 
THEY'RE SENSING IT 
YOU HAVE VASTLY 
EXPERIENCED PLAYERS IN F. A. CUP 
FINALS THE LIKES OF SOL KANU 
THEY CAN HELP THE OTHERS THROUGH DO 
YOU THINK 
PEOPLE DEAL WITH IT VERY 
DIFFERENTLY I HAVE SEEN VERY VERY 
EXPERIENCED PLAYERS FREEZE AND I 
HAVE SEEN YOUNG GUYS PLAY WITH 
FREEDOM PEOPLE LIKE DAVID JAMES 
HOW IS IT GOING TO AFFECT HIM BEEN 
THERE TWICE LOST TWICE DAVID DAVID JAMES THE TWO FINALS HE PLAYED IN 
LIVER LIVERPOOL AGAINST UNITED AND 
CHELSEA AND SREUL LAY VILLA IS 
THAT A LITTLE THING WHICH MIGHT 
PLAY ON A PLAYER'S MIND 
THIRD TIME 
LUCKY BIGGEST CHANGE IN THE THE 
MAN IS HIS MENTALITY HIS FOCUS AND 
CONCENTRATION HAS IMPROVED BY SO 
MUCH IT'S INCREDIBLE 
YOU WERE TWENTY FOUR 
TWENTY FIVE OR SOMETHING WHEN YOU PLAYED IN 
THE FIRST CUP FINAL NINETY THREE HOW DID 
YOU DEAL WITH THAT AS A RELATIVELY 
YOUNG PRO 
WELL I GOT DRUNK 
ACTUALLY BUT THAT'S WHAT I ADVISE 
I WAS RUNNING OUT OF TIME AS I 
SAW IT SIX YEARS YOU GET SIX 
CHANCES OF WINNING THE F. A. CUP TWENTY FOUR 
TWENTY FIVE RUNNING OUT OF TIME NOT WON 
THAT ONE THAT GOING THROUGH MY 
HEAD AND THE OPPORTUNITIES WERE 
RARE IN THOSE DAYS WE MANAGED TO 
WIN IT AND I THINK IT WAS THE BEST 
THING IN THE WORLD 
YOU ARE BECAUSE 
OF WHAT YOU WON AND WHAT YOU DID 
WITH THE ENGLAND TEAM YOU ARE A 
PORTSMOUTH PLAYERS WILL LOOK UP TO 
YOU AND RESPECT YOU DO THEY 
RESPECT YOU FOR AS MUCH AS THE WAY 
YOU HAVE TURNED YOUR LIFE LIFE 
AROUND AND DEALT WITH YOUR DEMONS 
AND MEDALS AND CAPS YOU WON 
I KNEW 
A FEW BEFORE I CAME HERE AND I HAVE 
BEEN TREATED BY EVERYBODY 
ESPECIALLY THE FANS THE FANS HAVE 
BEEN MAGNIFICENT DOWN HERE AND 
THEY'VE ALL BEEN FIRST CLASS 
STARTING WITH THE MANAGER HARRY 
WHEN HE FIRST ASKED ME TO COME DOWN 
HE HAS BEEN REALLY RESPECTFUL WHAT 
I DID AS A PLAYER MAYBE HE THOUGHT 
HE WANTED ME TO HAVE A GAME BUT I 
DON'T KNOW HAVE TO ASK HIM THIS THIS IS PROBABLY PORTSMOUTH'S GREATEST 
SEASON EVER DO YOU THINK L. KNOW 
THOUGH WON THE LEAGUE IN FORTY TWO TWO TOP TEN FINISHES AND F. A. CUP FINAL 
IS UNSURPASSED IN RECENT YEARS IF 
THEY GO ON AND WIN IF WE GO ON 
AND WIN F. A. CUP IT WILL BE A 
REMARKABLE SEASON 
WE WILL HAVE LIVE COVERAGE OF NEXT 
SATURDAY'S F. A. CUP FINAL 
COULD TONY ADAMS BE MORE LAID BACK 
AS THEY GO INTO THE CUP FINAL HE HE IS NOT PLAYING HE WASN'T LIKE THAT 
WHEN HE WAS PLAYING L. THINK 
PORTSMOUTH HAVE HAD A BRILLIANT 
SEASON AND WITH HARRY REDKNAPP AT 
THE HELM AND JOE JORDAN IN THE 
BACKGROUND TWO GREAT EXPERIENCED 
PEOPLE THERE L. THINK TONY WILL 
PLAY A HUGE PART ON F. A. CUP FINAL 
DAY BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN THERE HE 
HAS WON IT HE HAS BEEN CAPTAIN HE 
HAS LIFTED IT HE HAS HAD 
DISAPPOINTMENTS AS WELL FROM THAT 
POINT OF VIEW TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE 
THAT IN YOUR DRESSINGROOM IS 
INVALUABLE HE WILL BE THERE FOR 
ADVICE WE HAVE SEEN WHAT HE IS 
LIKE NOW VERY PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT 
THE GAME IF ANY YOUNG PLAYERS WANT 
HELP HE IS THE MAN TO TURN TO 
LET'S HEAR FROM THE CARDIFF 
CAMPAIGN AHEAD OF NEXT WEEK'S CUP 
FINAL JOE LEDLEY WAS THE SCORER 
AGAINST BARNSLEY HE CAN'T BELIEVE 
HIS LUCK THAT HE IS HEADING TO 
WEMBLEY 
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD WEMBLEY EVER THINK A CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM OR 
CARDIFF CITY WOULD BE IN THE FINAL 
IT'S A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE 
CLUB AND WALES HOPEFULLY WILL BE A 
LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING CHEERING US 
ON 
CARDIFF LEAD IT'S LEDLEY THE 
SCORER 
PEOPLE SAY WELL DONE AND SCORER THINGS LIKE THAT AND GREAT GOAL 
IT'S DOWN TO ME TO MAKE HISTORY 
AGAIN HOPEFULLY CAN DO THAT ON 
THE SEVENTEENTH 
I SHOULD THINK CARDIFF 
WILL MAKE THE MOST OF POMPEY'S POOR 
FORM 
BACK TO THE SEMI FINALS WEST FORM BROM GAVE THEM A GOOD GAME PLAYED 
ALL THE FOOTBALL POMPEY LOOKED 
NERVOUS CARDIFF ARE A GOOD 
FOOTBALLING TEAM AS WELL IT'S 
GOING TO BE A REAL TOUGH GAME FOR 
PORTSMOUTH AND THEY'RE NOT PLAYING 
WELL THEY'RE ASKING THEMSELVES 
QUESTIONS MAYBE CARDIFF CAN DO 
THAT ON THE DAY 
ALL RIGHT THAT'S 
IT FOR THIS WEEK 
WE WILL LEAVE YOU WITH ASTON

THE FACT IT'S KEEPING THEM OFF THE 
STREETS AND GIVING THEM SOMETHING 
PRODUCTIVE TO DO IT'S ALL GOOD DO DO YOU BELIEVE THE MIX OF STREET 
CULTURE WITH D. J. ING AND M. C. OFING 
WORKS WITH FOOTBALL 
A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE INTO THEIR MUSIC AND 
FOOTBALL MIXING IT TOGETHER MAKES 
IT RELAXED MORE A FUN DAY RATHER 
THAN COMING HERE TO WIN MEDALS 
THERE IS MORE TO DO THAN THE 
FOOTBALL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE 
STANDARD WHICH YOU HAVE WITNESSED 
HERE TODAY 
THE STANDARD'S BEEN ALL 
RIGHT I WAS WATCHING A GAME A 
MINUTE AGO I WAS IMPRESSED 
DIFFERENT TO WHEN WE PLAYED WE ARE 
ALL ABOUT THE WINNING RATHER THAN 
SHOWING OFF BUT AS LONG AS THEY'RE 
ENJOYING IT IT'S GOOD
