HELLO 
THIS PROGRAMME LOOKS AT THE TYPE OF GCSE RELIGIOUS STUDIES COURSES 
THAT DEAL WITH PHILOSOPHY AND ETHICS 
THE OTHER PROGRAMME IS ON WORLD RELIGIONS 
THE BEST WAY TO STUDY WITH BITESIZE IS 
WE'VE DIVIDED THIS PROGRAMME INTO TWO MAIN PARTS 
PHILOSOPHY AND ETHICS 
IF YOU DON'T YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 
ABOUT WHY PEOPLE HAVE THE OPINIONS THEY DO 
THINK OF A BUILDING 
EVERYTHING ABOVE THE GROUND RESTS ON THE FOUNDATIONS 
WE CAN'T EXPLAIN THE EFFECTS OF A RELIGION ON ITS FOLLOWERS 
OR EVALUATE ITS BELIEFS 
UNTIL WE'VE GOT SOME BASIC FACTS AND TEACHINGS AT OUR FINGERTIPS 
FIRST WE LOOK AT PHILOSOPHY 
PHILOSOPHERS TRY TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS 
BY LOOKING AT WHAT A RELIGION TEACHES 
IN PHILOSOPHY THERE ARE NO REAL ANSWERS 
WE CAN ONLY TRY AND WORK THEM OUT 
FIRST LET'S LOOK AT THE SECTION ON GOD 
THE IDEA THAT THERE IS A GOD IS CENTRAL TO MOST RELIGIONS 
PEOPLE BELIEVE THERE IS SOMEONE OR SOMETHING WHICH CREATED US 
AND THE WORLD WE LIVE IN 
SOME RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS THINK THAT THIS GOD CONTINUES TO LOOK AFTER US 
AND TAKE CARE OF US 
SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE WHEN WE DIE WE MAY GO TO HEAVEN AND BE WITH GOD 
OTHERS THINK GOD JUDGES US ACCORDING TO HOW WE HAVE LIVED OUR LIVES 
PEOPLE USE SEVERAL ARGUMENTS WHEN TRYING TO SHOW THAT GOD MUST EXIST 
WHEN YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU CAN USE THESE NAMES FOR THE ARGUMENTS 
BUT IT'S FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAT YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE ARGUMENT SAYS 
THE KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER ARE 
NOW TRY TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION 
HERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT POSSIBLE ANSWERS 
THEY'RE JUST SUMMARIES YOU'D NEED TO WRITE MORE THAN THIS IN THE EXAM 
BUT THEY GIVE AN IDEA OF WHAT THE EXAMINERS ARE LOOKING FOR 
THIS ANSWER GIVES JUST ONE ARGUMENT AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE DETAIL 
IT'S ALSO A LITTLE TOO SWEEPING 
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SAY THAT SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT 
AN ANSWER LIKE THIS WOULD PROBABLY GET AN E. GRADE 
THIS ANSWER IS MUCH BETTER 
IT CONTAINS MORE DETAIL AND DEALS WITH TWO OF THE ARGUMENTS 
AN ANSWER ALONG THESE LINES WOULD BE IN THE GRADE C. TERRITORY 
THIS ANSWER COVERS THREE OF THE ARGUMENTS 
DESCRIBES THEM WELL AND USES THE CORRECT NAME FOR ONE OF THEM 
A CANDIDATE WHO WROTE AN ANSWER LIKE THIS WOULD BE HEADING FOR A GRADE A 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON GOD 
NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO BELIEF 
RELIGION IS ALL ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE 
IN THIS SECTION THERE ARE THREE WORDS YOU NEED TO KNOW AND EXPLAIN 
SCIENTIFIC TRUTH IS THE EASIEST SORT OF TRUTH 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIPS ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF WORSHIP 
THEN PAUSE THE TAPE AND 
ARANEUS BEGAN HIS EXPLANATION OF EVIL IN PARADISE 
GOD MADE THE WORLD CONSISTING OF A SINGLE HUMAN PAIR ADAM AND EVE 
THEY WERE GOOD HAPPY IMMORTAL AGELESS 
THEY WERE ALMOST LIKE CHILDREN 
AND THEY WERE REMOVED FROM THE GARDEN BECAUSE THEY WERE IMMATURE 
THEY WERE PUSHED OUT OF THE WOMB TO ENTER A WORLD 
WHERE ALL OF US HAVE THE CHANCE TO GROW IN MATURITY 
FOR ARANEUS THE WORLD IS A BIT LIKE A VICTORIAN REFORMATORY 
WHERE SUFFERING IS OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH ON THE JOURNEY TO HEAVEN 
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE IN A GOD WHO'S PLACED SO MANY OBSTACLES TO HUMAN FULFILLMENT 
AUGUSTINE BEGAN HIS EXPLANATION OF EVIL WITH THE ENVY OF THE ANGELS 
WHO REVOLTED AGAINST GOD 
SATAN THE LEADER OF THE REBELLIOUS ANGELS 
DISGUISED HIMSELF AS A SERPENT AND TEMPTED ADAM AND EVE TO DISOBEY GOD 
DISOBEY THEY DID AS A CONSEQUENCE 
WE'VE ALL BEEN FLAWED INHERITING A NATURAL TENDENCY TOWARDS EVIL 
THE TROUBLE WITH AUGUSTINE'S EXPLANATION 
IS IT TAKES RESPONSIBILITY AWAY FROM GOD AND LAYS IT ON HIS CREATURES 
BUT IF THE CREATURES WHOM GOD MADE WENT WRONG THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A FLAW IN THEIR DESIGN 
SO GOD MUST THEREFORE BEAR THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT 
WE MUSTN'T BELITTLE THESE ATTEMPTS TO MAKE SENSE OF WHAT IS THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION OF HISTORY 
COSMOLOGY WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH CATHARISM 
IS A BELIEF THAT THEIR SOULS HAD BEEN STOLEN 
BY THE DEVIL FROM PARADISE AND HAD BEEN IMPRISONED IN HUMAN BODIES 
SO THEY SAW THEIR BODIES AS THE CELLS 
FROM WHICH THEIR SOULS MUST ESCAPE 
THAT MEANT THEY FOUGHT A CONSTANT WAR AGAINST THE FLESH 
WHICH IN ITS MOST FUNDAMENTAL FORM MEANT NOT PROCREATING 
CECI AIME ENCORE LIVRER POUR VOUS 
THESE BELIEFS LED THE CATHARS 
INTO CONFLICT WITH THE ROMAN CHURCH 
THEIR ABHORRENCE OF FLESH MEANT THEY BELIEVED CHRIST ONLY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A REAL BODY 
SO THE IDEA OF EATING CHRIST'S FLESH IN THE EUCHARIST WAS REPUGNANT 
IF THIS HAD BEEN THE CATHARS ONLY SIN ROME MAY HAVE LET THEM BE 
BUT THEY POSED A GREATER DANGER TO THE PAPACY 
IF YOU ACCEPT THE INVITATION YOU'LL COME FORWARD FOR BAPTISM 
WHAT YOU'VE DECIDED IN PRIVATE HAS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED IN PUBLIC 
BEHIND THE POOL IS AN ARTIST'S IMPRESSION OF THE RIVER JORDAN 
JUST STAY THIS WAY 
PUT ONE HAND OVER IT AND ONE HAND UNDER IT AND HANG ONTO MY WRIST WHAT'S YOUR NAME MARETTA ERANS 
MARETTA ERANS UPON YOUR PROFESSION OF FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST 
I BAPTISE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT 
BURIED IN THE LIKENESS OF HIS DEATH 
RAISED IN THE LIKENESS OF HIS RESURRECTION 
HOWEVER RETIRING ANY MEMBER OF THE CONGREGATION MAY BE 
THIS IS THE ONE MOMENT HE HAS TO STAND UP AND BE SEEN ALONE 
UPON YOUR PROFESSION OF FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST 
I BAPTISE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT 
BURIED IN THE LIKENESS OF HIS DEATH 
RAISED IN THE LIKENESS OF HIS RESURRECTION 
I ASKED YOUR DISCIPLES TO DRIVE OUT THE SPIRIT BUT THEY COULD NOT 
WHEN JESUS SAW THAT A CROWD WAS RUNNING TO THE SCENE 
HE REBUKED THE EVIL SPIRIT 
YOU FEEL THAT SOMEONE PUT A CURSE UPON YOU 
COME HERE FOR US TO PRAY FOR YOU 
ALL OF YOU WHO FEEL LIKE THAT 
CLOSE YOUR EYES MY LORD AND MY GOD 
LET YOUR PRESENCE IN THIS PLACE 
LIKE A STRONG LIGHT START DESTROYING ALL SPIRITS OF DARKNESS 
START TAKING OUT ALL SPIRITS OF DARKNESS 
THAT HAVE BEEN OPPRESSING THIS PERSON 
WHEREVER THERE IS A SPIRIT IN THIS PERSON'S LIFE 
MY GOD MAKE THIS EVIL SPIRIT COME OUT OF THIS PERSON RIGHT NOW 
FOR HIM TO BE SET FREE 
YOU EVIL FORCE 
DESTROYING HIS LIFE 
I COMMAND YOU TO MANIFEST HERE RIGHT NOW 
GET OUT OF THIS PERSON YOU SPIRIT OF OPPRESSION 
I COMMAND YOU IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST MANIFEST RIGHT NOW 
YOU RECEIVE THE WORD FROM ME 
YOU RECEIVE THE PAIN YOU BURN 
SPIRIT MANIFEST 
MANIFEST RIGHT NOW 
MANIFEST GET OUT OF THIS LIFE 
IN JESUS' NAME 
I ORDER THIS EVIL PRESENCE TO COME OUT HERE 
IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST 
GET OUT YEAH 
GET OUT YEAH GET OUT YEAH 
GET OUT YEAH GET OUT YEAH 
MUSLIMS HAVE THEIR PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE 
WHICH IS ISLAM THAT MAKES THEM IN THE SAME CATEGORY 
AS ANY IDEOLOGICAL GROUP BE IT CONSERVATIVES LIBERALS OR LABOUR 
THE ANCIENT RITUALS OF JUDAISM HAVE SURVIVED THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
CHRISTIANITY'S ATTEMPTS TO PERSECUTE THE JEWS PEAKED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
WHEN THE NAZIS EXPLOITED THE PAST OF DEMONISATION WITH MASS EXTERMINATION 
THIS MAN GOES TO THE SYNAGOGUE THOUGH HE HAS LOST HIS BELIEF IN GOD 
HE'S CONVINCED THAT IF HE OR HIS CHILDREN ABANDON THE RITUALS OF JUDAISM 
HE WILL HAVE GIVEN HITLER A POSTHUMOUS VICTORY 
HE WAS THIRTEEN WHEN HIS FAITH WAS SHATTERED THE NAZIS INVADED HIS HOME TOWN IN SOUTHERN POLAND 
AND MASSACRED HIS ENTIRE FAMILY 
WESTERN CHRISTIANITY'S DEMONISATION OF JEWS 
WAS AT THE CORE OF THE ANTI SEMITISM HE SUFFERED AS A CHILD 
SO HOW DID YOU DO 
AN IMPORTANT WORD TO REMEMBER IS NUMINOUS 
HERE'S A TYPE OF QUESTION YOU'LL GET IN THE EXAM 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON BELIEF 
NOW WE MOVE ON TO RELIGION AND SCIENCE 
THE ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT TOGETHER WITH HEAT AND ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES 
BROUGHT ABOUT MANY CHEMICAL CHANGES IN THE WATERS 
OVER THREE AND A HALF THOUSAND MILLION YEARS AGO 
OUR PLANET WAS DIFFERENT IN ALMOST EVERY WAY 
FROM THE ONE WE LIVE ON TODAY 
ERUPTING VOLCANOES BUILT UP ISLANDS OF LAVA AND ASH IN THE GLOBAL SEAS 
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS FILLED WITH GASES 
SUCH AS AMMONIA METHANE AND HYDROGEN 
FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS THE CHEMICAL SOUP THICKENED AND CHANGED 
POSSIBLY SOME COMPOUNDS WERE ADDED TO IT FROM OUTER SPACE 
SOME CARBON COMPOUNDS AGGREGATED IN DROPLETS 
WITH A MEMBRANE THROUGH WHICH OTHER CHEMICALS COULD PASS 
EVENTUALLY UNUSUALLY LARGE MOLECULES APPEARED 
WHICH HAD EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTERISTICS 
THEY CAUSED AMINO ACIDS TO FORM AROUND THEM AND SO BUILT PROTEINS 
THEY COULD ALSO PRODUCE COPIES OF THEMSELVES 
SUCH A MOLECULE KNOWN AS D. N. A. IS AT THE CENTRE OF EVERY LIFE CELL 
IT'S A DOUBLE SPIRAL LINKED BY CHEMICAL UNITS OF JUST FOUR KINDS 
THEIR ARRANGEMENT ACTS AS A CODE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PROTEINS 
AND A GROUP OF THEM IN A SECTION OF D. N. A. IS CALLED A GENE 
ON OCCASION THE D. N. A. UNZIPS 
EACH HALF THEN ATTRACTS THE CORRECT CHEMICAL UNITS 
AND SO FORMS TWO NEW IDENTICAL MOLECULES 
WHEN THIS FIRST HAPPENED 
PRIMITIVE CELLS FORMED NEW CELLS AND LIFE ON EARTH HAD APPEARED 
BUT SOMETIMES THERE IS A MISTAKE A MUTATION 
THESE CAUSED VARIATIONS IN THE FIRST CELLS 
AND NATURAL SELECTION SORTED THEM OUT 
THOSE THAT WERE AS WELL OR BETTER SUITED TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT SURVIVED 
THE REST DIED 
AND SO OVER TENS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS 
A VARIETY OF BACTERIA LIKE ORGANISMS DEVELOPED THRIVED AND INVADED NEW ENVIRONMENTS ON EARTH 
EVOLUTION HAD TRULY BEGUN 
THAT WAS THE SCIENTIFIC IDEA ABOUT HOW LIFE BEGAN 
BUT 
HERE'S THE TYPE OF QUESTION YOU'LL GET IN THE EXAM 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON RELIGION AND SCIENCE 
THIS MAY BE A HUMAN OR AN ANIMAL 
IT DEPENDS ON HOW WELL THEY LIVED THEIR LAST LIFE 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIPS 
AND SEE WHAT DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT DEATH YOU CAN FIND IN THEM 
THEN PAUSE THE TAPE AND MAKE A LIST OF THE IDEAS YOU HAVE SEEN 
TEN YEARS AGO A BABY THIS YOUNG WOULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED 
THE TECHNOLOGY BRINGS NEW DILEMMAS 
TREVOR HAS A BOWEL CONDITION DUE TO PREMATURITY 
DIAGNOSED WHEN ONLY A FEW DAYS OLD 
HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON 
JUST OVER A YEAR IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO 
THE NURSES GAVE HIM A PARTY IT WAS GORGEOUS FOR HIM 
IT REALLY WAS NICE 
HAS HE NEVER GONE HOME WITH YOU NEVER 
WE HAD HIM OUT IN A PUSHCHAIR 
WITH HIS MILK ON A MACHINE UNDER THE PUSHCHAIR 
IT'S BEEN TOO FAR TO TAKE HIM HOME WITH HIM BEING SO POORLY 
IT'S OUR DREAM TO HAVE HIM HOME 
SO HE'S HAD A YEAR OF HIS LIFE IN HOSPITAL YEAH 
AT THE MOMENT WE NEED TO TRY AND GET HIM THROUGH THIS CRISIS 
HE IS VERY SICK AT THE MOMENT 
I THINK HIS HOLD ON LIFE IS FAIRLY FRAGILE 
A FEW MINUTES AGO I WAS SUGGESTING TO YOU 
THAT IF HE COLLAPSED AND BECAME EVEN WORSE 
AND HE WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH BREATHING 
UM THEN 
MY FEELING IS THAT NOW BECAUSE HE'S BEEN THROUGH SUCH A LOT 
I WONDER WHETHER IT WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO PUT HIM BACK ON A BREATHING MACHINE 
OR WHETHER IT WOULDN'T BE THE RIGHT THING TO LET HIM DIE 
IF HIS HEART STOPPED 
DO WE HAVE TO LET YOU KNOW NOW 
NOT AT THE MOMENT BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT 
THROUGHOUT THE EVENING DOCTORS CARRY OUT ONE TEST AFTER ANOTHER 
THEY ALL SHOW TREVOR'S CONDITION IS RAPIDLY DETERIORATING 
I JUST GOT THE RESULTS BACK 
AND I'M AFRAID THAT POTASSIUM'S RELENTLESSLY GOING UP 
IT'S GONE UP DESPITE OUR ATTEMPTS WITH THE INSULIN 
AND DEXTROSE 
SO ER I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT 
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY WE COULD LOSE HIM TONIGHT 
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT 
HE COULD DIE TONIGHT 
I'LL SEE IF I CAN GIVE HIS KIDNEYS A KICK START 
WE'LL GIVE SOME DIURETICS IN A BIG DOSAGE AND REVIEW HIM AGAIN LATER 
I'LL COME BACK AND DO ANOTHER TEST AGAIN TONIGHT 
AND SEE WHERE WE'RE AT 
O. K. 
SO YOU CAN HAVE UM 
WE COMMEND UNTO OUR HANDS OF MERCY 
WHEN WE SAY WE'RE MAKING A SHOW ABOUT DEATH PEOPLE LOOK HORRIFIED 
NEARLY EVERYONE PREFERS TO AVOID THE SUBJECT WHILE THEY CAN 
IS IT POSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THE ASHES OF THE PERSON 
FROM THE ASHES OF THE COFFIN 
NO IT ISN'T BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY PUT THE COMPLETE COFFIN IN 
AND IT'S ALL BURNT TOGETHER THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN SEPARATE THEM 
BUT WE DO KEEP EACH INDIVIDUAL CREMATION COMPLETELY SEPARATE 
THE COMPLETE COFFIN GOES INTO THE CREMATOR 
THEN THE CREMATION PROCESS PROCEEDS 
AND IT TAKES BETWEEN AN HOUR AND AN HOUR AND A HALF 
AT THE END OF THE CREMATION THIS IS THE TYPICAL RESULT YOU WILL FINISH WITH 
YOU CAN SEE THE SKELETAL FORM OF THE BODY 
THE REMAINS ARE THEN REMOVED TO THE LOWER PART OF THE CREMATOR 
AND THEN RETRIEVED FOR FINAL PREPARATION 
TRADITIONALLY IN BRITAIN PEOPLE WERE BURIED 
CHRISTIANS ARE NOW CREMATED UNLIKE JEWS AND MUSLIMS 
MUSLIMS BELIEVE THE BODY MUST BE RESURRECTED FROM DUST 
ARE MUSLIM ATTITUDES TOWARDS DEATH DIFFERENT FROM CHRISTIAN ATTITUDES VERY MUCH SO 
DEATH ISN'T A TABOO WORD TO US BECAUSE WE HAVE FAITH 
IN GOD 
IN ALLAH 
WE'RE NOT FRIGHTENED OF DEATH WE LIVE IT EVERY DAY 
AND WE EXPECT OUR NEXT LIFE TO BE THE EVERLASTING LIFE 
OBVIOUSLY IT'S UPSETTING BUT THEY ACCEPT IT 
BY GETTING INVOLVED I THINK IT HELPS A LOT RATHER THAN GIVING THE JOB TO AN UNDERTAKER 
AND SAYING GET ME THE BEST COFFIN 
WITH US IT'S A DOING FUNERAL RATHER THAN POMP AND PAGEANTRY 
BECAUSE I'VE KNOWN FOR SIX YEARS THERE WAS THIS POSSIBILITY 
YOU COME TO TERMS WITH IT YOU NEVER THINK IT'LL BE YOU 
BUT YOU COME TO TERMS WITH IT 
WHEN I FOUND OUT IT WAS TERMINAL 
THERE WAS NO ER 
TEARS OF SORROW 
I KNEW AND I WAS QUITE HAPPY AND PEACEFUL 
AT THAT TIME IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MICHAEL THAT HE KNEW 
THAT THINGS THAT HE HAD DONE HAD BEEN FORGIVEN 
THERE WERE SEVERAL OCCASIONS WHEN I GOT ANGRY 
BECAUSE OLD WOUNDS WERE OPENED UP 
BUT THEY DIDN'T LAST FOR VERY LONG 
I CAN GET ANGRY BUT MY TEMPER IS ONE THAT GOES UP AND COMES STRAIGHT DOWN AGAIN 
I HAVE A LITTLE PHILOSOPHY 
MY BAGS ARE PACKED AND I'M READY TO GO ON MY NEXT JOURNEY AND I'M EXCITED BY IT 
I HAD A LONG CHAT WITH THE DOCTOR 
AND I SAID 
HE SAID I CAN BRING HIM BACK TO CONSCIOUSNESS 
BUT IT WOULD ONLY BE FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
I HAD TO BE HONEST AND SAY THAT'S NOT WHAT MIKE WANTS 
I CAN REMEMBER SAYING IT'S TIME TO LET GO 
AND LET GOD 
EVENTUALLY HE WENT VERY QUIET I THOUGHT HE WAS SLEEPING 
I CAN REMEMBER CLOSING MY EYES AND I JUST DOZED OFF TO SLEEP 
THE SISTER TOUCHED ME ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID HE'S GONE 
I'D NEVER EXPERIENCED DEATH BEFORE 
I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYBODY THAT WAS DEAD 
AND I WATCHED MIKE AND I WATCHED HIS WHOLE FACE CHANGE 
I WATCHED THE AGONY THE DESPAIR 
THE HOPELESSNESS I SUPPOSE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE PAIN 
THAT ALL DISAPPEARED 
AND HIS FACE WENT BACK TO 
WELL A YOUNG MAN'S FACE 
THE AGONY LINES HAD GONE THE DARKNESS AROUND THE EYES WENT 
THE COLOUR CAME BACK INTO HIS FACE 
I'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO BEAUTIFUL 
AND I'D ALWAYS BEEN SO AFRAID 
AND I THOUGHT MICHAEL YOU'RE AT PEACE 
THE LAST THING I SAID WELL THE PEACE OF THE LORD IS YOURS MIKE 
SO HOW DID YOU DO 
IN ALL THESE SEQUENCES 
HERE'S A TYPE OF QUESTION YOU'LL GET IN THE EXAM 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON DEATH AND THE AFTERLIFE 
NOW WE MOVE ON TO THE SECTION ON GOOD AND EVIL 
THESE ARE NOT EVIL IN THEMSELVES 
SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE ACTIONS LIKE THIS ARE THE WORK OF AN EVIL FORCE 
CHRISTIANS SAY THE DEVIL IS 
AS YOU WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIPS LOOK AT THE WAY THE DEVIL IS SHOWN 
WRITE DOWN ANY IDEAS ABOUT THE DEVIL WHICH YOU FIND THERE 
MEDIEVAL PAINTINGS SHOWED THERE WOULD BE A RECKONING 
THE PROMISE THAT THE VIRTUOUS GO TO HEAVEN IS ECLIPSED BY THE TORMENTS THE DEVIL HAS PREPARED IN HELL 
SATAN HADN'T ALWAYS CAST A SHADOW OVER THE CHRISTIAN IMAGINATION 
BUT AMID THE BRUTALITY OF MEDIEVAL EUROPE 
SATAN PROVIDED AN EXPLANATION FOR A HARSH WORLD 
I THINK THE MALLEUS RECYCLES A GREAT DEAL OF MISOGYNY 
IN A WAY WHICH ISN'T TYPICAL OF WITCHCRAFT TEXTS 
IT'S PICKING UP CLEARLY ON THE ANCIENT IDEA 
OF WOMEN AS INFERIOR MEN MUCH MORE LIABLE TO BE SEDUCED BY THE DEVIL 
THIS INTRODUCES A SEXUAL ELEMENT INTO THE THEORY 
THE MALLEUS IS INTERESTING EVIDENCE OF A STATE OF MIND 
AND WAS RAIDED BY LATER WRITERS FOR IDEAS 
IT'S INFLUENTIAL IN THAT INDIRECT SENSE RATHER THAN AS SOMETHING THAT PRODUCES ACTION 
IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX TWO MONKS PUBLISHED A BOOK KNOWN AS THE MALLEUS MALEFICARUM 
OR HAMMER OF THE WITCHES 
THERE WERE SIXTEEN GERMAN EDITIONS BEFORE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED 
IT WAS A POTENT BREW OF SUPERSTITION IDEOLOGY FANTASY 
AND CLUES ABOUT HOW TO SPOT THE DEVIL 
IT ECHOED THE IDEA THAT WITCHES CARRIED OUT HARM BY OCCULT MEANS 
FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD HURT YOUR ENEMIES BY STABBING DOLLS OF THEM 
BUT THE MALLEUS ADDED A NEW DIMENSION 
IT PROCLAIMED WITCHES HAD MADE A PACT WITH THE DEVIL 
BY HAVING SEX WITH SATAN THEY COULD SPREAD CHAOS AND DEATH 
THE MASS MURDERER FRED WEST MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS SOMEONE WHO IS EVIL 
WHEN MASS MURDERERS STRIKE IT STRETCHES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EVIL TO THE LIMIT 
RELIGION IS RELUCTANT TO BRAND SUCH ACTS AS THE WORK OF THE DEVIL 
SCIENCE HAS GIVEN INSIGHTS INTO BEHAVIOUR BUT IT FALLS SHORT OF PROVIDING AN ANSWER TO EVIL 
BE GONE DEVIL BE GONE DEVIL 
IN THE NAME OF ALMIGHTY GOD 
IN THE NAME OF LORD JESUS CHRIST HELP ME 
HELP ME 
HEAVEN HELP ME 
GET OUT FROM ME 
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS DEVIL BE GONE DEVIL 
FROM HIM 
HERE'S A QUESTION YOU MAY BE ASKED THAT HAS BOTHERED RELIGIOUS PEOPLE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
IF YOU'RE ASKED A QUESTION LIKE THIS THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THE ANSWER 
THAT'S THE END OF THE WHOLE SECTION ON PHILOSOPHY 
NOW WE MOVE ON TO THE PART OF THE PROGRAMME ON ETHICS 
IN THIS PART OF THE PROGRAMME WE LOOK AT 
FIRST LET'S LOOK AT RELIGION AND HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS 
IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS YOU WILL SEE DIFFERENT WEDDINGS 
AND PEOPLE DISCUSSING DIVORCE 
THE WEDDING MARCH 
BLESS 
RESERVE AND KEEP YOU 
I ASKED LUCY WHAT ATTRACTED HER TO CALUM 
IT WAS HIS UNIFORM HE WAS IN A KILT FINE 
WHAT ABOUT YOU CALUM HER LAUGHING AND SMILING 
SHE ALWAYS SMILES AND LAUGHS AND TALKS A LOT 
THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE I'M QUITE SHY 
WOULD YOU SAY YOU AND LUCY ARE ALIKE IN ANY WAY 
NO 
TOTALLY OPPOSITE DEFINITELY 
WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO MARRY HER WE GOT ON SO WELL 
WE'VE BOTH GOT A SENSE OF HUMOUR HIS IS MORE WICKED ANYTHING ELSE 
ER WE BOTH LIKE MONEY 
YOU BOTH LIKE MONEY WE HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH 
CALUM AND LUCY HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR EIGHT YEARS 
WHY GET MARRIED NOW WAS IT BECAUSE CALUM WAS LEAVING THE ARMY 
WE FELT THE TIME WAS RIGHT WE CAN SETTLE DOWN NOW 
I'VE SEEN SO MANY SEPARATIONS WITHIN THE ARMY 
IT'S QUITE DAUNTING 
TO TAKE THE STEP INTO MARRIED LIFE 
WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO US SO WE KEPT THAT IN THE BACK OF OUR MINDS 
HOW WILL THEY MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN 
WHAT YOU PUT IN TO IT YOU'LL GET OUT OF IT 
IF WE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO THE RELATIONSHIP WE'LL GET A LOT OUT 
IT'S SOMETHING I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO I WOULDN'T MARRY JUST ANYBODY 
I LIKE TO THINK NOW THAT BEING A COUPLE IS BETTER THAN BEING A MISS 
IT'S BETTER BEING MRS. THAN MISS 
FOR ME 
MY SECOND CHILD IS GETTING MARRIED NOW 
THE REST ARE GETTING READY TO GET MARRIED 
MAZEL TOV 
WE DON'T ENCOURAGE DATING SO THE GIRLS ARE BROUGHT UP IN A GIRLS ONLY ENVIRONMENT 
AND THE BOYS ARE BROUGHT UP IN A BOYS ONLY ENVIRONMENT 
SO WHEN THEY FEEL THEY'RE READY TO SETTLE DOWN 
THEN IT'S UP TO US TO FIND A MATCH FOR A CHILD 
PARENTS USUALLY BEGIN WITH A MATCHMAKER AN ANCIENT CUSTOM 
IT WAS A VERY BIG RELIEF 
WHEN I GOT THE COMPATIBLE RESULT 
I WAS HAPPY ETTIE WAS EVEN HAPPIER 
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL GET MARRIED I CAN'T ANSWER THAT 
I WON'T SAY I'LL NEVER GET MARRIED BUT YOU NEVER KNOW 
I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK FOR A HUSBAND BECAUSE THAT'S WHY MARRIAGES FAIL 
SAY YOU DO GET MARRIED YEAH WHAT WOULD BE YOUR MAIN PROBLEM 
WOULD IT BE A COMMITMENT OR SACRIFICE TRUST 
I THINK PROBABLY KEEPING MY INDEPENDENCE 
I'D STILL WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT 
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE KNOWN AS HIS OTHER HALF BUT AS ME 
I WOULDN'T CHANGE MY NAME 
THE NAME DOESN'T SYMBOLISE YOUR INDEPENDENCE 
BUT IT ALSO SHOWS I'M MY OWN PERSON AND NOT PART OF HIM 
I THINK THE HARDEST THING FOR ME WOULD BE GETTING ANNOYED OR BORED 
IN A MARRIAGE YOU'RE TRAPPED IN FINDING OUT THEIR NIGGLY BITS 
I THINK ONCE YOU GO OVER THOSE UPS AND DOWNS THE OBSTACLES 
IT MAKES THE LOVE STRONGER RIGHT 
IT IS SAID MARRIAGES FAIL BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE SUCH ROMANTIC IDEALS 
HOW DO YOU KEEP A RELATIONSHIP GOING IS ROMANCE IMPORTANT 
IT MAKES YOU HAPPIER WITH THE WORLD YOU WORRY LESS ABOUT THINGS 
THE ONLY THING YOU WORRY ABOUT IS IT FINISHING 
WHAT IS LOVE 
BABY DON'T HURT ME 
DON'T HURT ME 
NO MORE 
WHAT IS LOVE 
I DON'T THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPECT TO STAY WITH SOMEONE 
WHEN YOU ENTER INTO A RELATIONSHIP THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SEEN TO BE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE 
TAKE EACH DAY AS IT COMES 
WE HAVE A LIFE TOGETHER WE HAVE TWO CHILDREN TOGETHER 
WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS TOGETHER 
THE FACT REMAINS THAT I AM NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM 
AND I DISCOVERED THAT DURING THE MARRIAGE 
THAT'S WHEN IT STARTED TO FALL APART 
YOU CAN LOVE SOMEONE BUT IF YOU'RE NOT IN LOVE 
THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE A NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR A FRIEND 
WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY IT'S UP TO YOU 
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD FEEL LOVE FOR SOMEBODY 
AS DEEPLY AS I HAVE ENDED UP FEELING 
WITH ME IT TOOK YEARS TO GROW THE RELATIONSHIP 
SIMON ALWAYS KNEW IT WAS THE REAL THING 
BUT FOR ME IT WAS A SLOW PAINFUL PROCESS 
I THINK WOMEN ARE OPPRESSED WITHIN MARRIAGE 
SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO 
TO MAKE WOMEN HAVE FREEDOM IN SOCIETY IS GET RID OF MARRIAGE 
AND THE FAMILY INSTITUTION THAT GOES WITH IT 
THERE'S A POPULAR MYTH THAT GAY MEN DON'T STAY TOGETHER 
NOT ONLY WITH STRAIGHT PEOPLE BUT GAY PEOPLE TOO 
BUT I KNOW PLENTY OF GAY PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR YEARS 
FOR BETTER FOR WORSE FOR RICHER FOR POORER 
OUR FEELINGS ARE STRONGER THAN EVER 
THERE'S BEEN HARD TIMES WHEN WE COULD HAVE WALKED AWAY 
BUT WE'VE KEPT GOING AND WE'RE STILL HERE WE HOPE TO REACH OUR FIFTY 
TO LOVE AND TO CHERISH TILL DEATH US DO PART 
WHAT IS LOVE BABY DON'T HURT ME 
DON'T HURT ME NO MORE 
SO HOW DID YOU DO 
HERE'S A TYPE OF QUESTION YOU'LL GET IN THE EXAM 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON RELIGION AND RELATIONSHIPS 
NOW LET'S LOOK AT RELIGION AND MEDICAL ETHICS 
THIS IS TRUE OF A BABY AN ELDERLY PERSON OR EVEN AN ANIMAL 
THEY DON'T WANT A BABY 
SO THEY TRY TO MAKE SURE THE WOMAN DOESN'T BECOME PREGNANT 
THE LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY ALSO SAW SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENTS IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN REPRODUCTION 
THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO MANIPULATE THE PROCESS 
AND UNDERSTANDING OF GENETICS 
BEGAN TO OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF A REPRODUCTIVE REVOLUTION 
NO LESS STARTLING THAN THE SEXUAL ONE THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE 
SEVERAL DECADES EARLIER 
THIS LITTLE TABLET IS MORE EXPLOSIVE THAN DYNAMITE 
CAN YOU ASSESS THE LONG TERM EFFECTS NO BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN USING THE PILL LONG 
SERMONS HAVE BEEN PREACHED ON IT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE ARGUED OVER IT 
THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL SPEAKS OF THE IRKSOME ROUTINE OF PILL USE 
IS IT IRKSOME WE DON'T FIND IT SO 
IT'S A DRAMATIC SCIENTIFIC STEP FORWARD IN THE CONTROL OF NATURE 
ONE STARTLING DEVELOPMENT IN THE NEW BIRTH TECHNOLOGY 
TOOK PLACE IN JAPAN IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES 
SCIENTISTS HAD DEVELOPED AN ARTIFICIAL WOMB 
IN IT THEY HAD MANAGED TO GESTATE 
A BABY GOAT FROM THE LATER STAGES OF ITS MOTHER'S PREGNANCY 
WHILE THIS ARTIFICIAL WOMB WAS AIMED AT HELPING PREMATURE BABIES AND WAS STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGES 
ITS INITIAL SUCCESS OFFERED THE POSSIBILITY OF GESTATING AND DELIVERING A HUMAN FOETUS 
OUTSIDE ITS MOTHER'S WOMB 
AS THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY LOOMED IT BEGAN TO APPEAR POSSIBLE 
THAT THE DEFINITION OF SEX AS THE STARTING BLOCK FOR HUMAN REPRODUCTION 
WAS BECOMING OBSOLETE 
PRESS EXCITEMENT ABOUT I. V. F. PERSISTS COUPLES HOLD UP MIRACLE BABIES FOR THE ADMIRATION OF THE TABLOIDS 
EVEN IF A LINK WITH CANCER WERE TO BE PROVED MANY WOMEN WOULD PROBABLY DECIDE 
THAT I. V. F. WAS WORTH THE RISK 
HEROICALLY PERHAPS THEY'D DO ANYTHING TO HAVE A BABY 
LESS IMPRESSIVE IS THE WILLINGNESS OF PATIENTS AND DOCTORS TO RISK THE HEALTH OF POTENTIAL CHILDREN 
THERE IS DOUBT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF BABIES PRODUCED BY INTRACYTOPLASMIC SPERM INJECTION OR ICSI 
IN DEFIANCE OF NATURAL SELECTION 
SPERM INCAPABLE OF FERTILISATION ANY OTHER WAY ARE INJECTED INTO AN EGG 
TWO COMMONLY USED TESTS REVEAL THE SEX OF A FOETUS 
ULTRASOUND SCANS GIVE A PICTURE OF THE BABY 
AND FROM ABOUT THE EIGHTEENTH WEEK OF PREGNANCY 
THE SEX ORGANS CAN OFTEN BE SEEN 
AN AMNIOCENTESIS TEST TAKES FLUID FROM AROUND THE BABY 
THIS TOO WILL SHOW ITS SEX 
BUT THE POLICY ON GIVING WOMEN THIS INFORMATION 
DIFFERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY 
EAST ASKED URBAN MATERNITY HOSPITALS IF THEY WILL OFFER TO TELL MOTHERS 
THE SEX OF THEIR UNBORN BABIES 
HOSPITALS THAT DON'T OFFER TO TELL WOMEN THEIR BABY'S SEX ARE OFTEN IN AREAS WITH HIGH ASIAN POPULATIONS 
LONDON HOSPITALS SERVING SOUTHALL AND NEWHAM WHERE THE ASIAN POPULATION IS CONCENTRATED DO NOT 
HOWEVER SOME LONDON HOSPITALS WILL TELL MOTHERS WHO WANT TO KNOW 
HOSPITALS IN CITIES WITH A LOW ASIAN POPULATION WERE MORE LIKELY TO REVEAL THE INFORMATION 
LEEDS GENERAL INFIRMARY CHANGED ITS POLICY THREE YEARS AGO 
IT NOW TELLS WOMEN THE SEX IF THEY ASK 
THEY FOUND THEY WERE NINETY SIX PER CENT ACCURATE 
IN TELLING THE SEX FROM ULTRASOUND AT EIGHTEEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY 
THIS IS THE BABY'S BOTTOM WE HAVE A THIGH BONE HERE 
THE OTHER THIGH BONE IS HERE 
THE BIT WE'RE INTERESTED IN IS IN HERE 
BY NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE SCIENTISTS COULD SPLIT D. N. A. 
INTO SMALL SECTIONS BY CUTTING IT WITH ENZYMES 
THEY SEPARATE THE PIECES BY PLACING THEM 
WITH A DYE INTO SLOTS ON A PLATE OF GEL 
PASSING CURRENTS ACROSS THE GEL PULLS THE FRAGMENTS FIRST ONE WAY AND THEN THE OTHER 
IN THE PROCESS THE LONGER FRAGMENTS GET CAUGHT IN THE MATRIX OF THE GEL 
AND ARE GRADUALLY LEFT BEHIND 
ONCE SEPARATED THE FRAGMENTS THAT MAKE THE CELL PRODUCE THE B. T. TOXIN CAN BE IDENTIFIED 
THE SCIENTISTS FOUND THEY COULD NOT ONLY ANALYSE BUT CREATE THE GENES 
THIS MACHINE IS USED TO CONSTRUCT LONG LENGTHS OF D. N. A. 
IT PUTS TOGETHER THE FOUR KEY CHEMICALS IN THE ORDER TYPED IN 
ADENINE CYTOSINE 
GUANINE THYMINE 
IN THIS BOTTLE IT LABORIOUSLY PIECES TOGETHER ANY GENE 
FROM THE ONE THAT CODES FOR B. T. TOXIN TO OTHERS THAT CODE FOR ANYTHING THAT LIVES 
OR ANYTHING THAT WE COULD INVENT THAT WE WANT TO LIVE 
A BRAND NEW B. T. GENE IS NOW READY TO GO BACK INTO THE PLANT 
NOW FARMING HAS GONE INTO THE LABORATORY 
NOW BY ALTERING AN ANIMAL'S GENETIC CODE 
THEY CAN CHANGE ITS CHARACTERISTICS 
A GEEP HALF GOAT HALF SHEEP IS NOT ONE OF GOD'S CREATIONS 
IT COULD NOT OCCUR NATURALLY 
IT WAS MADE BY SCIENTISTS IN CAMBRIDGE SEVEN YEARS AGO 
THOUGH DISTURBING TO SOME IT PAVED THE WAY 
FOR TRANSGENIC ANIMALS THAT COMBINE THE GENES OF DIFFERENT SPECIES 
THESE ARE TRANSGENIC SHEEP IN ADDITION TO THEIR OWN GENES 
SCIENTISTS HAVE ADDED A HUMAN GENE 
SO THE SHEEP PRODUCE IN THEIR MILK 
A HUMAN PROTEIN BLOOD CLOTTING FACTOR NINE FOR TREATING HAEMOPHILIA 
THIS PROJECT BEGAN AT THE ROSLIN INSTITUTE IN EDINBURGH 
THREE YEARS AGO 
EACH SHEEP COSTS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO CREATE 
BUT ONE FLOCK COULD END THE WORLDWIDE SHORTAGE OF FACTOR NINE 
GENETIC SUPERPIGS NOW GROW FASTER AND PRODUCE MORE MEAT 
THESE TRANSGENIC PORKERS IN CAMBRIDGE ARE FATTENING WITH THE HELP OF CATTLE GROWTH GENES 
ONLY TWO YEARS OLD THIS BOAR WEIGHS HALF AS MUCH AGAIN AS AN ORDINARY PIG OF THE SAME AGE 
HE AND HIS OFFSPRING COULD ENGENDER PROFITS MOST FARMERS ONLY DREAM OF 
YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE A HISTORIC BIRTH FOLLOWING IN VITRO FERTILISATION 
I'M NOW HANDING THE BABY TO DOCTOR EDWARDS 
HIS BRAINS SKILL AND PERSEVERANCE HAVE MADE THIS BIRTH POSSIBLE 
THEY COULD BE TALLER CLEVERER OR HAVE A CERTAIN HAIR COLOUR 
ALL THIS THEY FEEL IS INTERFERING WITH WHAT GOD WANTS 
ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES YOU'LL HAVE TO DISCUSS 
ALL WOMEN WHO ENTER HERE REMAIN CONSCIOUS UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT 
JUST IN CASE THEY WANT TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS 
I FEEL NERVOUS I FEEL A BIT SCARED BUT IT'LL BE O. K. 
IT'LL BE O. K. IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH 
I WANT YOU TO BRING YOUR BOTTOM DOWN THAT'S IT 
I DON'T CONSIDER IT AS A FOETUS OR WHATEVER 
I DO CONSIDER IT AS A PERSON 
BUT THEN ALSO THAT PERSON IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT I CAN'T LIVE UP TO 
AT THIS EARLY STAGE IN PREGNANCY 
ABORTION IS SO SIMPLE IT COULD BE DONE UNDER LOCAL ANAESTHETIC 
BUT THE GIRL LIKE MANY OTHERS 
HAS CHOSEN TO BE UNCONSCIOUS DURING HER ABORTION 
LIKE NINETY PER CENT OF ALL ABORTIONS 
IT'S TAKING PLACE IN THE FIRST TWELVE WEEKS OF PREGNANCY 
A TUBE WILL BE PLACED IN HER WOMB 
THE FOETUS 
IS JUST THREE CENTIMETRES LONG 
SMALL ENOUGH TO BE SUCKED THROUGH THE TUBE INTO A CONTAINER 
IN NINETEEN NINETY THE ABORTION LIMIT WAS REDUCED TO TWENTY FOUR WEEKS 
AS MEDICAL ADVANCES LOWERED THE LEVEL OF VIABILITY 
CAMPAIGNERS FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS WERE EQUALLY DETERMINED 
THEY WANTED ABORTION ON REQUEST AND WERE UNHAPPY 
THAT DOCTORS STILL HAD POWER OVER WHAT THEY SAW AS A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE 
DURING THE NINETEEN NINETIES FRUSTRATED BY THEIR FAILURE TO OUTLAW ABORTION 
ANTI ABORTION CAMPAIGNERS TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO THE CLINICS AND THE DOCTORS THEY HELD RESPONSIBLE 
FOR WHAT THEY CLAIMED WAS THE WHOLESALE MURDER OF UNBORN CHILDREN 
LIFE MAY BE GOD GIVEN DEATH HE SEEMS RATHER TO HAVE LEFT TO US 
NOW WE CAN ADJUST DEATH'S TERMINAL TIMETABLE MEDICAL CUNNING 
HAS EXTENDED THE OPTION ON LIFE'S THREE SCORE YEARS AND TEN TENANCY 
DOCTORS NURSES AMBULANCE DRIVERS INTERCEDE IN LIFE DEATH DECISIONS 
SO WHY SHOULDN'T RELATIVES OR FOR THAT MATTER THE DYING THEMSELVES 
FOR LIFE MIGHT BE SACRED BUT TOO OFTEN DYING TAKES PLACE 
NOT IN THE ODOUR OF SANCTITY BUT IN THE STINK OF REMORSE INDIGNITY AND DISINFECTANT 
IF THERE IS NO REASONABLE PROSPECT OF MY RECOVERY 
FROM PHYSICAL ILLNESS OR IMPAIRMENT EXPECTED TO CAUSE ME SEVERE DISTRESS 
OR TO RENDER ME INCAPABLE OF RATIONAL EXISTENCE 
I REQUEST THAT I BE ALLOWED TO DIE AND NOT BE KEPT ALIVE 
IN HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO HIS EXECUTORS 
CANON WILLIAM PURCELL HAS DEMANDED DELIVERANCE FROM THE HUMILIATION OF THE SORT OF DYING HE FEARS 
MY MOTHER WAS A GREAT CHARACTER 
LIVELY OPINIONATED QUICK WITTED I FOUND IT DIFFICULT 
TO IMAGINE LIFE WITHOUT HER 
BUT SHE HAD BEEN AILING FOR SOME MONTHS AND FIERCELY RESENTED THE SLIGHTEST ILL HEALTH 
SHE'D SAY THAT HER TIME HAD COME SHE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE BIG SLEEP THAT COULD NOT BE FAR AWAY 
SOON AFTER HER EIGHTY FIFTH BIRTHDAY SHE HAD A STROKE AND BECAME PARALYSED ON ONE SIDE 
I HAVE HEARD OF PEOPLE BECOMING C. H. E. ERFUL IDIOTS 
BUT SHE WAS NOT CHEERFUL 
IN HER CONFUSION JUDGED TO BE IRREVERSIBLE SHE WAS DISTRESSED 
FRANTIC UNSMILING 
DESPERATE BEWILDERED 
TO LEAVE HER BY HERSELF WAS HEART RENDING 
SO I MADE SURE SHE DIDN'T DO TOO MUCH WAKING WHEN I WAS NOT THERE 
I FED HER BARBITURATE DISSOLVED IN BRANDY 
SQUIRTING IT TO THE BACK OF HER MOUTH USING A DISPOSABLE SYRINGE 
BUT SHE KEPT WAKING UP TO THIS MOCKERY OF A LIFE 
I READ IN THE NURSE'S NOTES 
URINE OFFENSIVE SPEECH INCOHERENT 
AT THAT MOMENT I DECIDED THAT MY MOTHER WAS NOT GOING TO LINGER ON IN THIS BEDLAM STATE 
I HAD TO RESCUE HER FROM THE NIGHTMARE EVEN IF I ENDED UP IN A PRISON CELL 
SO I TOLD HER THAT I LOVED HER AND WAS SENDING HER TO JOIN MY FATHER 
THIS TIME I GAVE HER A LARGE QUANTITY OF CAPSULES DISSOLVED IN BRANDY 
AND SHE WAS VERY SOON DELIVERED FROM HER BONDAGE 
IT IS TRUE THAT I WAS DELIVERED AT THE SAME TIME 
AND IF REWARDS ARE EVER GIVEN THE WOMEN WHO CARE YEAR AFTER YEAR 
FOR DEMENTED PARENTS MAY DESERVE A GREATER REWARD 
THOUGH I SEE NO MERIT IN AVOIDABLE MARTYRDOM 
WHEN THE SUFFERING INVOLVES THE PATIENT AS WELL AS THE CARER 
OF COURSE THINGS WERE RELATIVELY EASY FOR ME 
MY MOTHER WAS QUITE OLD I KNEW HER OWN WISHES VERY CLEARLY 
AND I HAD THE MEANS 
SO I HAVE NO REGRETS AND WOULD DO THE SAME THING AGAIN 
AND IF I WERE TO SUFFER A STROKE AS SHE DID 
I HOPE SOMEONE WOULD DO THE SAME FOR ME 
IT WOULD BE SAFER TO LET ME MOULDER IN A HOSPITAL WARD 
BUT IT WOULD NOT BE KINDER 
IF I HAD LET MY MOTHER LIVE ON 
I SHOULD HAVE HAD IT ON MY CONSCIENCE FOR EVER 
NOW TRY THIS EXAMINATION QUESTION 
YOU WON'T HAVE TIME TO COVER THEM ALL 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON RELIGION AND MEDICAL ETHICS 
NOW LET'S LOOK AT RELIGION AND EQUALITY 
THESE ARE WORDS YOU NEED TO BE QUITE SURE ABOUT WHEN DISCUSSING EQUALITY 
OR NOT ABLE TO CARRY OUT THE SAME TASKS 
WE LOOK ON BEAUTY'S FACE IGNORING UGLINESS IS OUR DISGRACE 
TIME TO LOOK UP FROM THE SCREEN 
AND LISTEN TO THE SCREAM BECAUSE IT'S REAL CAN YOU FEEL 
PEOPLE SAY THEY'RE NOT RACIST 
BUT EVERYONE IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT 
I AGREE YOU CAN'T BE RACIST IF YOU'RE FROM AN ETHNIC MINORITY 
BECAUSE THE WORD RACIST MEANS IN POWER BASICALLY 
IT MEANS THOSE IN POWER OPPRESSING OTHERS I DON'T AGREE 
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT BECAUSE SOMEONE WHO'S BLACK FOR EXAMPLE 
IS PREJUDICED AGAINST SOMEONE WHO'S ASIAN THEY'RE NOT RACIST 
BECAUSE NEITHER GROUP IS DOMINANT IN THE COUNTRY 
THEY'RE STILL RACIST JUDGING ON GROUNDS OF RACE 
WHAT DO PEOPLE ON THE STREET SAY 
HOW RACIST DO YOU THINK THIS COUNTRY IS IT'S GOING FROM BAD TO WORSE 
THE GOVERNMENT IS GIVING BENGALIS AND CHINESE BOAT PEOPLE PRIORITY 
OVER ENGLISH PEOPLE IN HOUSING AND EVERYTHING 
HOW DOES LIVING IN A MULTI ETHNIC SOCIETY FEEL TERRIBLE WHY'S THAT 
I WAS IN THE WAR WHAT WERE WE FIGHTING FOR 
MY BEST FRIEND IS BLACK I'VE GOT MY FRIEND 
AND QUITE A LOT OF THE TIME I GET PICKED ON 
BECAUSE SHE'S BLACK AND I'M WHITE 
THERE ISN'T REALLY ANY DIFFERENCE 
IT'S JUST SHE'S FROM AFRICA AND I'M FROM ENGLAND 
ARE RACIST WORDS INSULTING YEAH 
THEY SOMETIMES CALL ME A PAKISTANI PAKI AND THAT STUFF 
SO I MEAN THAT KIND OF STUFF 
JUST BECAUSE MY SKIN IS BROWN AND THEIRS IS WHITE THEY CALL ME THAT 
HE'S NOT FROM PAKISTAN ANYWAY HE'S FROM BANGLADESH 
A LOT OF PEOPLE CALL ME CHING CHONG CHINAMAN 
SOMETIMES I GO AND TELL THE TEACHER OR JUST LEAVE IT ALONE 
SOMETIMES IT MAKES ME UNHAPPY IF YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH SOMEONE 
THEY'LL GO UGH GET AWAY FROM ME WHY IS IT IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK ABOUT RACISM 
THE MORE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT THE MORE THEY UNDERSTAND SO IT'S BETTER 
I'M PLAYING 
I AM PLAYING 
HOW DO YOU THINK YOUNG CHILDREN LEARN 
ABOUT RACISM IN THE FIRST PLACE FROM OLDER PEOPLE 
FROM PEOPLE IN THEIR HOME 
OR PEOPLE IN SOCIETY IN GENERAL 
THEY ARE NOT BORN WITH ANY VIEWS 
ABOUT RACE OR GENDER HOW IMPORTANT IS EDUCATION IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS 
IN COUNTERING RACISM CRUCIAL 
IT'S WHERE IT HAS TO HAPPEN 
BECAUSE IT IS YOUNG CHILDREN WHOSE THOUGHTS AND IDEAS AND AWARENESS 
IS BEING DEVELOPED 
AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL 
THAT WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT RESPECT REGARD AND TOLERANCE OF EACH OTHER 
WE THEN WENT TO MEET THE WALSHES 
WHO NEED IRON GRIDS TO PROTECT THEM FROM RACIAL ATTACK AND HAVE BEEN HELPED BY THE GREENWICH COMMITTEE 
TWO YEARS AGO THIRTY PEOPLE TRIED TO BREAK IN AND ATTACK THEM 
THEY SMASHED THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND THE BACK FENCE AND DOOR 
YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE COMING IN FROM THREE SIDES 
AND MYSELF MY WIFE AND MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER WERE IN THE HOUSE 
IT'S FRIGHTENING AND YOU ARE FRIGHTENED 
THE POLICE ACTUALLY SAID TO ME 
IF YOU'D MARRIED ONE OF YOUR OWN KIND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM 
HOW WERE YOU AFFECTED BY WHAT HAPPENED 
THEY MADE ME FEEL THAT I WAS DIFFERENT 
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT I'M LIKE MIXED RACE 
BUT PEOPLE JUST ACCEPTED ME FOR THAT AND THESE PEOPLE MADE ME FEEL 
REALLY DIFFERENT 
I'M PROUD OF MY MUM AND I'M PROUD OF MY DAD I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY THINK 
WE NOW KNEW RACISM IS MORE SUBTLE TODAY BUT ALSO MORE VIOLENT 
WE JOINED THIRTY THOUSAND DEMONSTRATORS 
IN A RALLY TO PROTEST AGAINST RACIAL ATTACKS 
RACISM DESTROYS LIVES WHITE LIVES AS WELL AS BLACK LIVES 
BECAUSE IT DESTROYS THE HUMANITY OF THE PERPETRATOR 
STIR IT UP BY BOB MARLEY 
THIS IS A DEMONSTRATION AGAINST RACISM 
THE LARGEST IN RECENT TIMES IN BRITAIN 
TO SHOW THUGS ON THE STREETS OF EAST LONDON THAT THEY'RE NOT THE MAJORITY 
THEY'RE A MINORITY THE VAST MAJORITY OF SOCIETY ABHORS RACISM 
PARTICULARLY HARRASSMENT AND VIOLENCE THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT GET AWAY FROM BLAME 
THEY'VE CREATED THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH RACISM FLOURISHES THERE'S HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT 
HOMELESSNESS HIGH CRIME AND BLACK PEOPLE ARE BEING BLAMED FOR THAT 
HOW CAN WE COMBAT RACISM 
THERE'S A SAYING THAT WE USE IN THE ANTI RACIST ALLIANCE 
ALL THAT'S NEEDED FOR EVIL TO PREVAIL IS FOR GOOD PEOPLE TO DO NOTHING 
WE APPEAL TO PEOPLE TO STAND AGAINST RACISM 
I ARRIVED APRIL NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN I APPROACHED TWO BRITISH POLICEMEN AND I WAS TOLD TO E. F. F. OFF NIGGER 
I WAS SIMPLY SHOCKED 
I CAN'T MISS I'M TERRIBLY SORRY I WOULD HELP BUT IF I LET YOU COME IN ALL MY BOYS LEAVE 
THEY TOOK I 
FROM THE BOTTOMLESS PIT 
I BELIEVE THERE IS LESS RACISM IN THE POLICE THAN THE WIDER COMMUNITY 
BECAUSE WE SCREEN OUT APPLICANTS WHO SHOW THOSE TENDENCIES 
BUT WE DO AFTER ALL REPRESENT THE WIDER COMMUNITY 
THE MORE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT THE MORE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND 
THEN IT GETS BETTER 
SONGS OF FREEDOM 
COS ALL I EVER HAD 
REDEMPTION SONGS 
REDEMPTION SONGS 
EMANCIPATE YOURSELVES FROM MENTAL SLAVERY 
MY PARENTS ARE ALWAYS THINKING OF GOING BACK HOME BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS THINK THAT ONE DAY 
ENGLAND WILL KICK THEM OUT LIKE IN KENYA AND UGANDA 
NONE OF THEM CAN STOP THE TIME 
HOW LONG SHALL THEY KILL OUR PROPHETS 
WHILE WE STAND ASIDE AND LOOK 
SOME SAY IT'S JUST A PART OF IT 
WE'VE GOT TO FULFILL THE BOOK 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL THAT WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME 
TALKING ABOUT RESPECT REGARD TOLERANCE OF EACH OTHER 
COS ALL I EVER HAD 
REDEMPTION SONGS 
NOW TRY THIS EXAMINATION QUESTION 
WHEN ANSWERING AN EXAMINATION ON EQUALITY REMEMBER 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON RELIGION AND EQUALITY 
NOW LET'S LOOK AT POVERTY AND WEALTH IN RELIGION 
AND THAT IS WHY PEOPLE IN POORER COUNTRIES ARE OFTEN STARVING 
IN THE SAME WAY 
DAWN AND AS THE SUN BREAKS THROUGH THE CHILL OF NIGHT ON THE PLAIN OUTSIDE KOREM 
IT LIGHTS UP A BIBLICAL FAMINE 
NOW IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
THIS PLACE SAY WORKERS HERE IS THE CLOSEST THING TO HELL ON EARTH 
THOUSANDS OF WASTED PEOPLE ARE COMING HERE FOR HELP 
MANY FIND ONLY DEATH THEY FLOOD IN FROM VILLAGES HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY 
DULLED BY HUNGER DRIVEN BEYOND THE POINT OF DESPERATION 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN HERE NOW 
SUFFERING CONFUSED LOST 
LORD I CALL TO YOU FOR HELP 
EVERY MORNING I PRAY TO YOU 
WHY DO YOU REJECT ME LORD 
THIS IDEA OF ABANDONMENT AND BEING FORGOTTEN 
BOTH BY THE REST OF THE HUMAN RACE AND ALSO I THINK BY GOD 
THE CAMPS IN KOREM AND EVERYTHING 
THERE WAS A CURIOUSLY SPIRITUAL FEELING TO IT 
NOT NECESSARILY FEELING THE PRESENCE OF GOD 
BUT I HAVE TO BE HONEST AND SAY FEELING THE ABSENCE OF GOD 
DEATH IS ALL AROUND 
A CHILD OR AN ADULT DIES EVERY TWENTY MINUTES 
KOREM AN INSIGNIFICANT TOWN HAS BECOME A PLACE OF GRIEF 
LORD GOD MY SAVIOUR I CRY OUT ALL DAY 
AND AT NIGHT I COME BEFORE YOU 
HEAR MY PRAYER LISTEN TO MY CRY FOR HELP 
YOU ASK YOURSELF HOW CAN THIS BE TOLERATED BY A SUPREME BEING I'VE BEEN TOLD IS ALL POWERFUL AND GOOD 
EITHER HE'S ALL POWERFUL AND HE'S NOT ALL GOOD OR 
HE'S ALL GOOD AND NOT ALL POWERFUL TO TOLERATE SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
THERE SEEMS NO JUSTIFICATION WITHIN MY PARTICULAR RELIGIOUS TEACHING WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL 
TO BE ABLE SATISFACTORILY TO EXPLAIN WHAT I'M SEEING IN FRONT OF ME 
I AM ABANDONED AMONG THE DEAD ALL MY STRENGTH IS GONE 
LORD I CALL TO YOU FOR HELP WHY DO YOU REJECT ME LORD 
YOU HAVE MADE EVEN MY CLOSEST FRIENDS ABANDON ME AND DARKNESS IS MY ONLY COMPANION 
AND I COULDN'T BUT IMAGINE THAT OTHER PEOPLE OBSERVING IT FROM AFAR 
OR THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES EXPERIENCING IT 
MUST SURELY BE ASKING THE SAME QUESTIONS THEMSELVES 
THE REALISATION THAT IN OUR COUNTRY WHAT HAPPENS TO A POOR MAN THE CONCEPT OF HOSPITAL CAME TO MY MIND 
THAT STRUGGLE TOOK TEN YEARS 
HAD MY MOTHER NOT SUFFERED PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT A COINCIDENCE 
I FEEL THAT THIS WAS A GUIDING STONE GUIDING ME TO ANOTHER DIRECTION IN LIFE 
WHERE WAS GOD FOR YOUR MOTHER IN HER PAIN 
YOU KNOW PEOPLE LOOK AT LIFE IN TOO SMALL A TIME SPAN 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THINGS LIKE THE HEREAFTER 
AND THEN THE PAIN SHE SUFFERED FOR TWO MONTHS 
AND IMAGINE HOW MUCH IN A YEAR THAT HOSPITAL HAS DONE FOR OTHER PEOPLE 
WE'VE ALREADY HAD THREE HUNDRED SIXTY PATIENTS 
BECAUSE THE CONCEPT OF GOD IS SO DIFFICULT FOR A MIND TO ABSORB 
WE ARE TOLD NOTHING HAPPENS ON THIS EARTH WITHOUT THE WILL OF GOD 
NOW WHAT POWER THAT GOD MUST HAVE 
SO THE MIND CANNOT IMAGINE THE HUMAN MIND WAS NOT MADE TO FULLY IMAGINE WHAT GOD IS 
THE QUESTION COULD BE 
NOW TRY THIS EXAMINATION QUESTION 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON POVERTY AND WEALTH IN RELIGION 
NOW MOVE ON TO THE FINAL SECTION IN THE PROGRAMME 
WHENEVER YOU LOOK AT THE NEWS ON THE TELEVISION RADIO OR IN THE PAPERS 
SOME CHRISTIANS BELIEVE THAT A WAR MAY BE FOUGHT IF IT'S A JUST WAR 
THIS MEANS IT MUST MEET CERTAIN CONDITIONS 
OTHERS MAY SUPPORT A HOLY WAR 
JEWS BELIEVE THEY MUST PROTECT THEMSELVES AND OTHER JEWS 
AND HELP OTHER COUNTRIES PREVENT THE SPREAD OF WAR 
AS YOU WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIPS 
IN MARCH NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT SO THE ACCOUNT GOES 
A U. S. ARMY PLATOON IN SEARCH OF VIETCONG SOLDIERS 
ARRIVED AT A VILLAGE CALLED MY LAI 
THERE THEY FOUND NO VIETCONG BUT FIVE HUNDRED UNARMED CIVILIANS WERE SHOT 
WOMEN WERE RAPED THEN KILLED OLD MEN AND CHILDREN WERE KILLED 
AFTERWARDS IT'S CLAIMED 
THE SOLDIERS SAT DOWN AMONG THE BODIES AND HAD LUNCH 
WHY DO PEOPLE DO THIS SORT OF THING 
PERHAPS THEY CAN BE SO BRAINWASHED THAT THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
AND WHAT'S TRUE OF MY LAI IS TRUE OF SO MUCH HUMAN EXPERIENCE 
THIS IS THE END 
BEAUTIFUL FRIEND 
WHO IS REALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ATROCITIES 
EVERYONE IS PARTLY RESPONSIBLE BUT NO ONE IS COMPLETELY RESPONSIBLE 
AND SO IT IS THAT EVIL CAN FLOURISH IN ORGANISATIONS 
AND LARGE COMPLEX GROUPS 
WHAT THESE APPALLING ATROCITIES REALLY SHOW 
IS THE CAPACITY OF ANY OF US TO BE DESTRUCTIVE FOR THE PLEASURE OF IT 
WHEN ALL RESTRAINTS ARE REMOVED 
I'LL NEVER LOOK INTO YOUR EYES 
AGAIN 
AS THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS BERLIN THE ALLIES FOUND A COUNTRY DEVASTATED BY AERIAL BOMBARDMENT 
OVER A QUARTER OF GERMAN HOMES HAD BEEN DESTROYED 
AND A QUARTER OF THE PEOPLE HAD NO WATER OR ELECTRICITY 
BEAUTIFUL CITIES LIKE HAMBURG HAD VIRTUALLY BEEN RAZED 
IN ALL SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GERMAN CIVILIANS HAD BEEN KILLED 
BY ALLIED BOMBS A DEATH TOLL THAT RAISED GREAT ISSUES OF STRATEGY 
AND ETHICS ISSUES THAT STILL PERSIST 
WHAT IS YOUR MOST POWERFUL SENSE OF STRATEGIC BOMBING 
I DETEST IT FOR ANYBODY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH NATIONALITY OR COUNTRY 
I THINK IT'S THE LOWEST FORM 
HOW SOLDIERS CAN KILL WOMEN AND CHILDREN ESPECIALLY IN DRESDEN WHERE THE WAR WAS OVER 
IT WAS ABOUT FINISHED IN TWO WEEKS 
AND THE REFUGEES OUR PRIESTS ALL KILLED WHAT IS THE SENSE FOR THAT 
WELL I WAS A WIRELESS OPERATOR IN A LANCASTER BOMBER 
DURING A TOUR OF OPERATIONS 
DRESDEN WAS JUST ANOTHER RAID AS FAR AS WE WERE CONCERNED 
IT TOOK TEN HOURS TWENTY MINUTES A ROUND TRIP 
WE DON'T THINK AT THE TIME WE'RE GOING TO BOMB CIVILIANS 
THOUGH WE KNOW IF THEY DON'T GET OUT THEY'LL BE IN TROUBLE 
WELL I THINK I REGRET HAVING TAKEN PART IN THAT SORT OF EXERCISE 
AND IN SAYING THAT I DON'T WISH IN ANY WAY 
TO DETRACT FROM THE TREMENDOUS COURAGE SHOWN BY BOMBER COMMAND 
BECAUSE MANY OF THEM WERE FRIENDS OF MINE 
WHO WERE KILLED IN THAT OPERATION 
BUT I DO FEEL THAT IT EXCEEDED THE BOUNDS 
OF THE MORALITY OF WARFARE 
AND I THINK IT'S HAD A SERIOUS EFFECT 
ON OUR THINKING ABOUT THE MORALITY OF WARFARE EVER SINCE 
AIR VICE MARSHALL ON THIS THE BOMBING OF CIVILIANS 
OF HOMES WOMEN CHILDREN SCHOOLS HOSPITALS INEVITABLE IN THE PROCESS OF AREA BOMBING 
IS IT FAR AWAY FROM A CRIME OF COURSE IT IS 
TO BE CONVICTED OF A CRIME YOU MUST HAVE HAD THE INTENT TO COMMIT IT 
THERE WAS NO INTENT ON THE PART OF ANYONE MAY I SPEAK 
FROM THE LEADERSHIP TO THE POOR CHAPS IN THE AIRCRAFT AN EXAMPLE 
IN WUPPERTAL WHERE MY BROTHER WAS BORN WE KNOW IT WELL 
WHEN THE BOMBING THERE TOOK PLACE 
LIQUID PHOSPHOROUS WAS DROPPED 
CHILDREN WOMEN RAN INTO THE RIVER WUPPER LIKE TORCHES TO BE PUT OUT 
HOW CAN THAT POSSIBLY NOT BE SEEN AS A CRIME 
THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT IN MY MIND 
THAT AIR MARSHALL HARRIS' STRATEGY WAS TO DEMORALISE THE GERMAN NATION 
BY DESTROYING WHOLE CITIES AND KILLING AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE 
THAT'S ON RECORD IT'S NOT A MATTER OF DISPUTE 
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO ASK AND IT WAS THE BRAVE BISHOP OF CHICHESTER 
NOT WITH HINDSIGHT BUT IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR 
WHO IN A VERY REMARKABLE SPEECH AND NO BISHOP IN ENGLAND WAS MORE ANTI NAZI THAN HE 
WHEN MANY OTHERS WERE NOT BEFORE THE WAR HE ALWAYS OPPOSED HITLER 
BUT HE SAID WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW NOT JUST FOR THE PRESENT BUT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS 
IS SETTING A PATTERN OF TERROR THAT WE CANNOT JUSTIFY 
HE DIDN'T USE THE WORDS WAR CRIME BUT WHAT HE SAID AMOUNTED TO IT BEING SOMETHING CRIMINAL 
FOR THE SAKE OF BRITAIN WE MUST STOP IT 
SOME OF THE JEWS AT AUSCHWITZ TODAY WERE RETURNING FOR THE FIRST TIME 
ESTHER BRUNSTEIN CAME TO BRITAIN AFTER THE WAR 
SHE WAS WITH EDWARD STOURTON 
SHE ARRIVED IN AUSCHWITZ IN AUGUST NINETEEN FORTY FOUR CRAMMED INTO A TRUCK LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS 
SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AND WITH HER MOTHER 
THE FIRST ORDEAL WAS SELECTION THOSE DESTINED TO DIE AT ONCE SEPARATED FROM THE REST 
IT WAS JUST THE MOVEMENT OF A THUMB 
RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT 
MY MOTHER WAS ASKED 
HOW OLD 
AND SHE SAID 
FORTY FOUR OR FORTY FIVE I'M NOT SURE IT WAS JUST BEFORE HER FORTY FIFTH BIRTHDAY 
AND SHE WAS PUSHED TO ONE SIDE 
HOW OLD ARE YOU AND I SAID I WAS EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN TO THE OTHER SIDE 
I WANTED TO RUN AFTER MY MOTHER AND I WAS JUST PUSHED BACK 
AND TO MY DYING DAY I WILL NOT FORGET THE LOOK ON HER FACE 
WE WERE PUSHED INTO SHOWER ROOMS 
AH I CAN JUST SEE SOME OF THE YOUNG S. S. MEN LOOKING ON AND LAUGHING 
AND MAKING SOME DEROGATORY REMARKS ABOUT OUR BODIES 
AND I WAS A VERY YOUNG GIRL AND EVEN THEN IT STILL SOMEHOW MATTERED 
IT WAS THIS 
THIS 
TOTAL HUMILIATION 
AND THEN WE WERE PUSHED INTO A BLOCK 
AND I THINK THERE WERE EIGHT HUNDRED OF US 
AND WE WERE WELCOMED WITH THE WORDS 
YOU HAVE COME HERE TO DIE 
FIFTY YEARS ON 
AND I HAVEN'T LEFT THE PLACE 
AND I HAVE TO SCREAM AND SHOUT 
AND I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED 
AND I WAS HERE 
GAS GAS GAS GAS GAS GAS GAS GAS GAS 
BRITISH SOLDIERS UNDER SIMULATED ATTACK FROM NERVE GAS 
ON A MODERN CHEMICAL BATTLEFIELD 
NO AREA OF SKIN CAN BE EXPOSED TO THE AIR 
THESE SOLDIERS ARE DRESSED NOT TO KILL MERELY TO SURVIVE 
IN THE FOLK MEMORY GAS IS MAYBE THE MOST FEARED AND HORRIFIC OF WEAPONS 
NOW NATO GENERALS BELIEVE THAT IF BRITISH TROOPS EVER HAD TO FIGHT A REAL WAR 
THEY COULD BE EXPOSED TO GAS AGAIN 
TO TOP BRITISH AND AMERICAN SOLDIERS 
THE THREAT OF ATTACK BY GAS IS ENORMOUS 
AS YOU WATCH THIS PROGRAMME 
IN AN EXAMINATION YOU MAY BE ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST 
WHEN YOU ANSWER THIS THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT 
YOU MIGHT ALSO BE ASKED A QUESTION LIKE THIS 
AS WE HAVE SEEN SOME PEOPLE WILL NOT FIGHT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES 
THIS IS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID BUT BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S WRONG 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON RELIGION PEACE AND JUSTICE 
THAT'S THE END OF THE PROGRAMME ON PHILOSOPHY AND ETHICS 
THE OTHER PROGRAMME ON RELIGIOUS STUDIES IS WORLD RELIGIONS 
DON'T FORGET THERE'S MORE INFO IN THE GCSE BITESIZE BOOKS
