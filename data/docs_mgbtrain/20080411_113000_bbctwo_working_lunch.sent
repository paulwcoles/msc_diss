IT IS A GRUELLING TEST OF 
ENDURANCE HAT CAN DRAG ON FOR ENDURANCE HOURS AND HOURS 
GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO FRIDAY'S 
HOUR LONG WORKING LUNCH I'M ADAM 
SHAW SHAW HELP AT HAND FOR FUEL POOR 
HOUSEHOLDS 
THE GOVERNMENT AND ENERGY COMPANIES 
HAVE PLEDGED TWO FIFTY M. BUT CHARITIES 
SAY IT WON'T EVEN SCRATCH THE 
SURFACE 
THE F. T. S. E. RISES AGAIN AND SOMETHING 
TO CHEW ON FOR CADBURY SCHWEPPES AS 
IT REPORTS RISE IN GUM SALES 
I'M PADDY O'CONNELL COMING UP TOO 
ROB'S MESSING ABOUT ON THE 
RIVER I AM TAKING TRIP ALONG 
WITH THE RIVER BLYTHE ON THE 
SUFFOLK COAST BOTH OF THESE PLACES 
ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RIVER ARE 
VERY POPULAR HOLIDAY SPOTS AND YET 
THE SEA IS NOW THREATENING TO RISE 
UP AND SWAMP THE LAND AROUND THIS 
DESTROYING ALL THE HOMES AND 
BUSINESSES RIGHT ACROSS THIS AREA 
PLUS WE'LL BE TALKING MONEY AND 
THE MARATHON AND HEARING ABOUT 
WORK LIFE BALANCE IN THE 
TERRITORIAL ARMY AND IT'S REVISION AN 
GOVERNMENT SAYS IT HAS REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH SIX OF THE LARGEST 
ENERGY COMPANIES TO SPEND MORE OF 
THEIR PROFITS HELPING THE POOREST 
HOUSEHOLDS IT IS CLAIMED UP TO 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS COULD BE HELPED 
RACHEL WHO CAN GET THIS HELP 
THIS EXTRA MONEY IS GOING TO BE 
AIMED AT HOUSEHOLDS ON LOW INCOMES 
THOSE MOST VULNERABLE TO FUEL 
POVERTY HOUSEHOLDS WHERE THERE ARE 
YOUNG PEOPLE OLD PEOPLE OR 
DISABLED PEOPLE THE GOVERNMENT'S 
DEFINITION OF FUEL POVERTY IS A 
HOUSEHOLD THAT HAS TO SPEND MORE 
THAN TEN PER CENT OF THEIR INCOME ON HEATING 
THE HOME TO TWENTY ONE DEGREES AND 
PERIPHERAL AREAS OF THEIR HOME TO 
EIGHTEEN DEGREES 
PERIPHERAL AREAS OF THEIR HOME TO EIGHTEEN DEGREES 
SIX ENERGY COMPANIES IN 
THE U. K. HAVE AGREED TO TRYING TO 
ERADICATE FUEL POVERTY THEY SAY 
THEY ARE DOING THIS VOLUNTARILY IT 
IS NOT A LEGAL OBLIGATION AND 
THOSE SIX COMPANIES ARE CENTRICA 
SCOTTISH POWER EON NPOWER 
SCOTTISH AND SOUTHERN AND E. D. F. 
ENERGY ENERGY HOW MUCH MONEY ARE THOSE COMPANIES 
ACTUALLY GOING TO INVEST 
THE MONEY 
THAT THE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO 
INVEST IS GOING TO COME OUT OF 
THEIR PROFITS AND THE AMOUNT WILL 
VARY FROM COMPANY TO COMPANY BUT 
IT HAS BEEN SPLIT ALONG THE LINES 
OF THEIR MARKET SHARE THE TOTAL 
AMOUNT THIS FINANCIAL YEAR WILL BE 
FIFTY MILLION THAT IS GOING TO 
TREBLE BY TWO THOUSAND TEN UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION 
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY AVAILABLE 
GENERALLY IF YOU ARE SITTING AT 
HOME RIGHT NOW AND YOU THINK YOU 
MIGHT BE ABLE TO QUALIFY HOW DO 
YOU GO ABOUT GETTING YOUR HANDS ON 
IT 
WELL THE WAY THE COMPANIES IT SPEND HIS MONEY IS UP TO THEM THIS 
IS A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT THEY CAN 
DECIDE HOW TO INVEST THIS MONEY 
BUT THERE WILL BE TWO MAIN WAYS 
THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT THEIR 
SOCIAL TARIFFS TARIFFS ESPECIALLY 
DESIGNED TO HELP MORE VULNERABLE 
HOUSEHOLDS GUARANTEE THEM A LOWER 
TARIFF A CHEAPER PRICE FOR FUEL 
AND THEY WILL ALSO BE LOOKING AT 
WAYS OF GIVING GRANTS TO MAKE HOMES 
MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT WITH THOSE 
SOCIAL TARIFFS IF YOU THINK YOU 
MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE EACH COMPANY HAS 
DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AND THINGS 
THEY SAY YOU NEED TO BE ELIGIBLE 
IT MAY BE THAT IF YOU QUALIFY FOR 
CERTAIN BENEFITS YOU QUALIFY FOR 
THIS SO THE BEST THING TO DO IS 
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE COMPANY 
DIRECTLY EQUALLY IF YOU THINK YOU 
MIGHT QUALIFY FOR A GRANT TO HELP 
QUALIFY WITH DRAUGHT PROOFING GET 
IN TOUCH WITH YOUR COMPANY DIRECTLY 
BUT THERE IS A HEALTH WARNING 
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SCHEMES 
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE DESIGNED TO HELP 
GUARANTEE LOWER PRICES QUITE OFTEN 
IF YOU GO ON TO THE WEBSITE YOU 
CAN FIND THAT ONLINE TARIFFS ARE 
ACTUALLY LOWER THAN THOSE SOCIAL 
TARIFFS 
GIVEN WHAT YOU SAID JUST TARIFFS THEN AND INDEED THE RESPONSE TO 
THESE PROPOSALS DO PEOPLE FEEL 
THAT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE 
THIS IS 
NOT ALL THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS 
DOING TO TRY AND ERADICATE FUEL 
POVERTY THEY ALSO GIVE WINTER FUEL 
PAYMENTS TO HOUSEHOLDS WITH PEOPLE 
OVER THE AGES OF SIXTY AND EIGHTY WHICH 
ARE GOING UP NEXT YEAR THEY ALSO 
INVEST IN PROGRAMMES WHEREBY PEOPLE 
CAN APPLY FOR GRANTS TO MAKE THEIR 
HOMES MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT BUT IN 
TERMS OF GETTING THE ENERGY 
COMPANIES TO HELP OUT WE SHOULD BE 
JOINED NOW BY ANNE ROBINSON FROM 
USWITCH A PRICE COMPARISON COMPANY 
WHO IS ALSO A FORMER CHAIR OF 
ENERGYWATCH THE YOU THINK THIS IS 
A SATISFACTORY ANNOUNCEMENT 
I HAVE 
TO SAY ARE BUSY IT IS WELCOME 
I HAVE TO SAY OBVIOUSLY IT IS 
WELCOME BUT I DO NOT THINK IT GOES 
FAR ENOUGH YOU MENTIONED THAT 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE COULD BE TAKEN OUT 
OF FUEL POVERTY BY SPENDING A 
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY OVER THREE 
YEARS BUT THIS YEAR ALONE BECAUSE 
OF THE PRICE INCREASES FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUT INTO FUEL 
POVERTY MAKING A TOTAL OF FORTY FIVE 
MILLION SO I AM AFRAID STACKED UP 
AGAINST THAT IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE 
A LOT OF MONEY 
THAT HAS HAPPENED 
BECAUSE OF THE RISE IN FUEL PRICES 
AND WHILE PRICES WHICH THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS NO CONTROL OVER SO 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE THE GOVERNMENT 
TO DO 
FIRST OF ALL CAN I JUST AT 
ONE FURTHER POINT WHICH I WANTED 
TO MAKE AND THAT IS THAT IT IS 
MONEY WAS SPREAD AROUND ALL FORTY FIVE 
MILLION PEOPLE YOU'RE LOOKING AT 
JUST UNDER EIGHTEEN PER YEAR ON AVERAGE 
BILL OF ONE THOUSAND FORTY EIGHT L. THINK THAT WHAT 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING IS 
ASKING OFGEM TO GET THE COMPANY'S 
TO AGREE SOME COMMON STANDARD FOR 
SOCIAL TARIFFS THAT IS CHEAPER 
THAN MAINLAND TARIFFS IT SHOULD BE 
SOMETHING WHICH PEOPLE CAN 
UNDERSTAND AND CAN ACCESS REGULARLY 
BECAUSE THEY ARE WRONG FOR EXAMPLE 
A PENSION CREDIT OR A FAMILY CREDIT 
OF SOME SORT BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU 
WILL HAVE SOCIAL TARIFFS WHICH 
PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND THEY ARE 
LIKELY TO GET AND THAT WILL MAKE A 
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IT WOULD BE 
A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION TO WHAT 
IS A GROWING PROBLEM BRIEFLY BRIEFLY THESE ENERGY COMPANIES ARE AGREEING 
TO DO THIS TO INVEST MONEY FROM 
THEIR PROFITS THEY ARE UNDER NO 
OBLIGATION TO DO THIS ISN'T THIS 
NOT SOMETHING THEY SHOULD BE 
COMMENDED FOR IS THIS NOT I I THINK IT IS BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO 
REMEMBER IS THAT WHEN OFGEM TOOK 
THE PRICE CONTROLS OFF IN TWO THOUSAND ONE I 
WAS CHAIR OF ENERGYWATCH AND I 
SAID TOO OFTEN YOU HAVE TO PROTECT 
VULNERABLE PEOPLE IT IS ALL RIGHT 
TAKING THESE PRICE CONTROLS OFF 
RETAIL PRICES BUT IF THE COMPANIES 
START RAISING THE PRICE IS A LOT 
SOME SPECIAL PROTECTION IS NEEDED 
I THINK THIS SPECIAL PROTECTION IS 
NEEDED NOW AND I THINK OF JIM 
SHOULD INTRODUCE A SET OF SOCIAL 
TARIFFS TARIFFS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US 
RACHEL THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME 
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER 
THIS WEEK YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT 
FUEL POVERTY AND IN FACT FRIENDS 
OF THE EARTH AND HELP THE AGED WERE 
ASKING FOR A JUDICIAL REVIEW 
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT FOR NOT 
GIVING ENOUGH TO TACKLE FUEL 
POVERTY WHAT IS THEIR RESPONSE TO 
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT 
I SPOKE TO HELP THE AGED THIS 
MORNING AND THEIR RESPONSE IS NOT 
THAT COMPLEMENTARY HELP THE AGED 
LIKE HAMEUR BOUAZZA THERE THEY DO 
NOT THINK THEY ARE DOING ENOUGH 
THEY SAY THIS INITIATIVE WILL 
ONLY JUST BEGIN TO SCRATCH THE 
SURFACE FUEL POVERTY IS INCREASING 
INCREASING ANOTHER ONE SAID THE 
GOVERNMENT IS FAILING THE MOST 
VULNERABLE BY NOT TAKING ENOUGH 
ACTION THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL NOT 
EVEN PAPER OVER THE CRACKS IN ITS 
FUEL POVERTY STRATEGY A GENERAL 
FEELING IS THAT THEY ARE DOING 
SOMETHING BUT IT IS NOT JUST 
ENOUGH IT IS JUST NOT ENOUGH 
HERE IS THE OTHER BUSINESS NEWS 
B. A. A. AND BRITISH AIRWAYS HAVE 
POSTPONED MOVING THE AIRLINE'S 
LONG HAUL FLIGHTS FROM TERMINAL FOUR 
TO THE NEW TERMINAL FIVE UNTIL JUNE 
THE MOVE WAS DUE TO HAPPEN ON APRIL 
THIRTIETH THE GMB UNION HAS WELCOMED 
THE DELAY SAYING IT WILL GIVE THEM 
TIME TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS 
SMOOTHLY 
AGE CONCERN SAYS THOUSANDS OF 
ELDERLY PEOPLE IN ENGLAND ARE BEING 
FORCED TO PAY FOR LONG TERM CARE 
THAT THEY SHOULD BE GETTING FREE 
THE CHARITY SAYS OLDER PEOPLE WITH 
SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE BEING 
ROUTINELY FAILED BY THE N. H. S. 
DESPITE NEW GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES 
IT FOUND ELDERLY PEOPLE IN CERTAIN 
AREAS OF ENGLAND ARE DENIED ACCESS 
TO CARE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHERE 
THEY LIVE 
THE SUITS HAVE ADMITTED THEY FAILED 
TO WARN THE WORLD ABOUT THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH ONE OF THE BIGGEST SHOCKS 
TO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN A 
GENERATION PAY DEALS ARE NOSING 
HIGHER RESEARCH SAYS THAT MOST 
DEALS ARE NOW FOUR PER CENT IT SAYS THERE IS 
STILL A BIG GAP BETWEEN RISES IN 
THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR FOR YOUR WEEKEND DOSE OF 
PERSONAL FINANCE DON'T FORGET YOU 
CAN TUNE INTO MONEY BOX TOMORROW 
WHEN THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT THE 
IMPACT OF THIS WEEK'S INTEREST CUT 
INTEREST RATE CUT ALSO WHO IS 
AFFECTED BY THE FALLING POUND 
THERE IS AN OLD JOKE TO USE ABOUT 
YOUR COLLEAGUE IN THE OFFICE WHY 
DOES MATCH LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW 
IN THE MORNING WHY DOESN'T 
MATCH THE ANSWER IS THAT SHE WOULD 
HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE AFTERNOON 
HERE IS THE VIEW FROM OUR OFFICE 
WHILE I TELL YOU ABOUT THE WORKING 
LUNCH BROADBAND PLAYER FROM OUR 
WEBSITE YOU CAN WATCH US AT WORK 
BITS OF US CHUNKS OF US OR THE 
WHOLE THING COLLEAGUES TO LOOK AT 
THIS VIEW OF LONDON TO A LONG COULD 
INSTEAD CLICK WHERE IT SAYS WATCH 
AGAIN THEY MIGHT MISS OUT ON THE 
OLD GASOMETER EVERY NOW AND AGAIN 
MANY REGULARS OF WORKING LUNCH WILL 
KNOW THAT IF YOU PAY FOR SOMETHING 
ON A CREDIT CARD AND THERE WAS A 
PROBLEM THERE IS GOOD CHANCE OF 
GETTING YOUR MONEY BACK IT IS PART 
OF THE CONSUMER CREDIT ACT BUT 
WHAT OF LAST BUT WHAT A LOT OF US 
IN THE OFFICE DID NOT REALISE WAS 
THAT THERE IS A SIMILAR SYSTEM WITH 
SOME DEBIT CARDS WE HAVE COVERED 
THIS BEFORE BUT WE HAVE FOUND IT 
IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS IT SEEMS WE 
WENT TO FIND OUT WHY 
LAST MONTH THIS COMPANY WENT INTO 
ADMINISTRATION FOUR THOUSAND CUSTOMERS HAD 
OUTSTANDING ORDERS ONE OF THOSE 
WAS A WORKING LUNCH VIEWER 
BASICALLY I BOUGHT THE BED EARLY 
JANUARY AND ARE PAID THROUGH THE 
CITY BANK VISA DEBIT CARD AND THE 
TOTAL AMOUNT CAME TO ONE THOUSAND THIRTY WE 
WERE SUPPOSED TO GET THE DELIVERY 
ON FOURTH APRIL BUT ON THE FIRST 
APRIL I WAS TOLD BY THE STORE 
MANAGER THAT THE COMPANY HAS GONE 
INTO BANKRUPTCY AND THEY WILL NOT 
BE MAKING ANY DELIVERIES 
HE IS NOT 
THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS RECENTLY BEEN 
LEFT WITHOUT WHAT THEY PAID FOR 
AMANDA WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A 
TRIP TO LAS VEGAS THIS MONTH SHE 
HAD PAID OVER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FOR TWO 
FLIGHTS USING HER HALIFAX DEBIT 
CARD SHE WAS TRAVELLING WITH AN 
AMERICAN AIRLINE BACK IN 
DECEMBER THEY CEASED TRADING AND 
FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION 
NOW THANKFULLY BOTH OF THOSE TWO 
HAD SEEN ON THIS PROGRAMME THE 
ISSUE OF CLAIMING THAT MANY WHEN 
YOU HAVE PAID BY DEBIT CARD IT IS 
A PROCESS CALLED CHARGE BACK BUT 
IT'S NOT AVAILABLE ON ALL BANK 
ACCOUNT CARDS IT IS A PROCESS 
OPERATED BY VISA YOU CAN ASK FOR A 
VISA CHARGE BACK FROM YOUR BANK IF 
THE GOODS YOU RECEIVE ARE DAMAGED 
OR IN THE CASES WE HAVE 
HIGHLIGHTED YOU DO NOT GET WHAT 
YOU PAID FOR THERE IS NO MINIMUM 
OR MAXIMUM THAT YOU CAN CLIMB BUT 
YOU MUST LODGE YOUR CLAIM WITHIN 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OF THE TRANSACTION OUR 
TWO VIEW WAS CONTACTED THE BANKS 
AND ASKED FOR THE PROCESS TO BE PUT 
INTO ACTION CHARGE BACK IS A 
RECOGNISED SYSTEM WITHIN THE 
BANKING INDUSTRY BUT QUITE OFTEN 
IN CALL CENTRES VERY LITTLE IS 
KNOWN ABOUT IT WHEN WE PUT THIS TO 
THE ORGANISATION THAT REPRESENTS U. K. 
BANKS THEY TOLD US 
CITIGROUP HAVE APOLOGISED AND SAY 
THE MAN WE HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER IS 
ENTITLED TO MAKE A CLAIM THEY SAY 
THEY WILL MAKE SURE THEIR CUSTOMER 
SERVICE TEAM ARE FULLY AWARE OF THE 
SCHEME THE HALIFAX WHO ISSUED 
AMANDA'S CARD HAVE ALSO APOLOGISED 
AND ADMITTED HER INITIAL CLAIM WAS 
DEALT WITH IN CORRECTLY SHE HAS 
RECEIVED HER MONEY BACK AS A 
GOODWILL PLUS A GOODWILL GESTURE 
OF TWENTY FIVE SO IF YOU EVER FIND 
YOURSELF WITHOUT GOODS OR SERVICES 
YOU HAVE PAID FOR USING A VISA 
DEBIT CARD CALL YOUR BACK IF THE 
FIRST PERSON YOU TALK TO 
NOT 
KNOW ABOUT CHARGE BACK ASKED TO 
SPEAK TO A SUPERVISOR NOW LET'S 
GO ON TO THE MARKETS GOT OFF TO A 
GOOD START THE F. T. S. E. WAS UP SIX THOUSAND 
AND THEN JUST BEFORE WE CAME ON AIR 
IT SLIPPED DOWN BELOW IT SO VERY 
VOLATILE CADBURY SCHWEPPES SOON 
TO SPLIT INTO TWO HAVE REPORTED 
STRONG REVENUE GROWTH IN THE FIRST 
QUARTER FOLLOWING A GOOD 
PERFORMANCE FROM ITS CHEWING GUM 
BUSINESS ALSO STRONG PERFORMANCES 
IN EMERGING MARKETS THE 
CONFECTIONERY REVENUES OR GROWTH OF 
SEVEN PER CENT BEVERAGES SAW REVENUE GROWTH OF 
THREE PER CENT NONETHELESS LOOKING AT THE 
WHOLE FOODS SECTOR NOT ONE OF THEM 
SHOWING A RISE TODAY LET'S HAVE A 
LOOK AT SOME OF THE MORE WIDELY 
HELD SHARES IT LOOKS LIKE MOST OF 
THEM ARE DOWN I THINK THAT HAS 
BEEN A TURN IN THE LAST HOUR OR SO 
BRITISH AIRWAYS IS TO POSTPONE 
MOVING ITS LONG HAUL FLIGHTS TO 
TERMINAL FIVE THIS DOES NOT SEEM TO 
HAVE HAD AN EFFECT ON THE SHARE 
PRICE THERE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER 
BIG MOVERS I. T. V. DOING RATHER WELL 
TODAY THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IT IS DOWN 
FORTY NINE 
DAVID BUICK IS HERE WITH ME TO SHED 
SOME LIGHT AND ENJOYMENT ON THE 
MARKETS 
IT DID LOOK LIKE THE MARKETS WERE 
DOING WELL THIS MORNING BUT THEN IS 
EVAPORATED WHY 
I THINK TWO POINTS 
I DON'T THINK IN FORTY SIX YEARS I CAN 
EVER REMEMBER SUCH A BLAND 
ACCEPTANCE TO A OH TWO FIVE PER CENT PER CENT CUT IN AN 
INTEREST RATE EVERYONE TURNED 
AROUND AND SAID AND AND THERE IS 
NOTHING NO ONE IS GOING TO SEE ANY 
CHEAPER BORROWING WHILE THE 
LIQUIDITY CRIES STAYS WITH US 
CRISIS WHICH EFFECTS EVERY SECTOR 
WE HAVE GOING THE BANKING SECTOR 
BECAUSE NO ONE TRUSTS EACH OTHER 
YOU HAD AN INTERESTING THING UP 
THERE ABOUT THE FOOD COMPANIES NOT 
ONLY HAVE THE COSTS OF THE 
COMMODITIES ARE GOING UP THEY ARE 
ENDEMIC OF THE CREDIT CRISIS THEIR 
BORROWING COSTS GO UP THEIR MARGIN 
IS LOWER AND THEY BECOME LESS 
ENTHUSIASTIC TO A THING THEY 
SHOULDN'T BE 
THE MINING SECTOR HAS 
BEEN TREMENDOUS 
WHILE WE ARE ON CADBURY'S A VIEWER 
OF THE PROGRAMME HAS WRITTEN IN 
NICK DEELEY IS HE CONFUSED ABOUT 
THE DEAL BEING OFFERED TO HOLDERS 
THE CADBURY'S SCHWEPPES SHARES MUCH 
HE DOESN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE 
POSITION HE IS IN DO YOU THINK 
THAT THE SPLIT GOOD NEWS FOR 
SHAREHOLDERS OR NOT 
IT'S LIKE 
TIMING I THINK THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER SIX TO NINE MONTHS AGO HAD 
THE RIGHT IDEA HAVE YOU TO PROVIDE 
BETTER SHAREHOLDER VALUE BY 
KEEPING HIS GUM WHICH HE PLAYED A 
HUGE PREMIUM FOR IT WAS LIKE AS 
INTO AROUND YOUR NECK WITH A COUPLE 
OF BIG WEIGHTS ON NOW IT'S GOING 
IT'S TRIDENT OVER HERE SWEETS AND 
CONFECTIONERY IS VERY GOOD WHEN 
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE AN AMORPHUS OF A 
WHOLE LOT OF THINGS IT'S DIFFICULT 
FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO VALUE IT 
SPLITTING THE FIZZY DRINKS DIVISION 
IN THEY MANAGE TO GET THE DEAL AWAY 
LAST SUMMER BEFORE THE SUB PRIME 
LENDING THING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
FABULOUS THEY HAVE BEEN CAUGHT 
WITH HIGHER BANK CHARGES HENCE THE 
SHARE PRICE IS GOING DOWN SIX PER CENT AND 
THE FACT THAT EVEN THOUGH A DEAL IS 
GOING TO GO THROUGH IT'S NOT GOING 
TO BE AS ATTRACTIVE AS IT WAS SIX 
MONTHS AGO 
LET'S LOOK AT THE 
MOVERS OF THE WEEK THAT IS 
INTERESTING YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT 
THE MINING SECTOR DOING VERY WELL 
THEY ARE ALL MINING COMPANIES TOP 
ONE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED NEVER HEARD OF THIS 
COMPANY IT SOUNDS LIKE THE SONG 
CONTEST 
IT'S THE SAME PEDIGREE AS CONTEST KAZAKMISH IT CAME INTO THE SHARES 
ABOUT A MONTH AGO IT'S SHARE PRICE 
HAS ROCKETED FROM SIX HUNDRED PENCE TO ELEVEN HUNDRED 
PENCE IS THERE TALK THAT THE TWO 
COMPANIES WILL GO TOGETHER THE 
MARKET HAS ACCEPTED IT'S THE RIGHT 
WAY FORWARD CUTTING COSTS GREATER 
OPPORTUNITIES TO SELL STUFF TO 
INDIA AND TO CHINA FANTASTIC 
COMPANY WORTH KEEPING AN EYE ON 
B. H. P. WE HAVE SEEN CHINA BUILD UP A 
BIGGER STAKE THERE 
THERE WAS TALK 
THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT MIGHT 
BUY BILLITON 
THEY WOULD LIKE TO 
THAT WILL BE FOUGHT VERY HARD THE 
IDEA THAT THEY ARE GETTING THEIR 
ACT TOGETHER MAKING SURE THAT THE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA IS VERY 
IMPORTANT IMPORTANT LET'S LOOK AT THE DOWNSIDE A 
BIGGER MIX OF COMPANY HBOS LONDON 
STOCK EXCHANGE AND THE SOFTWARE 
GROUP SAGE WE CAN SCUTLE THROUGH 
THEM 
SAGE HAD A DOWNTURN LONDON STOCK 
EXCHANGE THE VOLUMES HAVE 
COLLAPSED THIS YEAR 
HBOS BECAUSE OF MORTGAGES GOING UP 
AND THE FACT THAT THE ACTIVITY IS 
LIKE TO DROP THIRTY PER CENT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE WILL 
HAVE LOOK AT THE WEEK AHEAD LATER 
IN THE PROGRAMME FOR THE MOMENT 
LET'S GO BACK TO PADDY WHO IS 
LOOKING TROUBLESOME HE IS WAVING 
HIS FINGER IN THE AIR DID I HEAR 
DAVID SAY FORTY SIX YEARS IN THE CITY I I DID SADLY IT'S ANORAK MATERIAL 
NO I THINK IT'S EXPERIENCE TO DIE 
FOR YOU WILL HAVE SEEN INTEREST 
RATES AT THIRTEEN PER CENT IN THE NINETIES WHAT DO 
YOU THINK HOUSEHOLDERS HAVE NOW 
THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEN 
OBVIOUSLY THE GREAT THREAT OF RATES 
FOR PEOPLE AT FIVE PER CENT AT THIRTEEN PER CENT 
WE ARE NOW LIVING IN A LOWER CYCLE 
OF INTEREST RATES WHERE PROBABLY 
THE TOP OF IT IN THE MATURE WESTERN 
ECONOMYS IS PROBABLY SEVEN PER CENT IN MY DAY 
I PAID FROM MY HOUSE IN ISLINGTON 
I COULD ONLY BORROW THIRTY THOUSAND L. PAID 
TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE PER CENT FOR THE LAST TEN THOUSAND THAT 
THANK GOODNESS IS A NIGHTMARE READY 
TO BE 
HE IS AN OLD SMOOTHIE PADDY 
PRETENDING HE DOESN'T THINK HE IS 
AN OLD KODGEER 
THAT IS THE CORRECT ASSESSMENT 
SILVER MEDAL CORRECT ASSESSMENT 
EVERYONE CAN CALM DOWN NOW WE HAVE 
BEEN LOOKING ALL WEEK AM SOME OF 
THE VERY MANY CONCERNS FOR THE DAYS 
PEERING COASTLINE UNDER THREAT 
FROM RISING SEA LEVELS THERE HAS 
BEEN TALK OF CRUMBLING SEA DEFENCES 
WE HAVE HEARD W. H. IT MEANS FOR 
HOMEOWNERS WHAT ABOUT BUSINESSES 
WE HAVE BEEN TO THE EAST ANGLIA 
COAST TO FIND OUT MORE IT WAS 
DUTCH ENGINEERS WHO DIVERTED THE 
RIVER BLYTH AND DRAINED THE MARSHES 
YEARS AGO THINS SEN A MIXTURE OF 
CLAY AND WALLS HAVE HELD IT BACK 
IT WILL COST THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND TO RETAIN THE 
WATER LOCALS SAY WATER IS ALREADY 
BEGINING TO BREAK THROUGH WITH THE 
BREACHES THIS COULD INCREASE THE 
FLOW IN THE RIVER IF TINKERS MARSH 
WERE ALLOWED TO BREACH FOR ANY 
LENGTH OF TIME IT WOULD IMPIN DGE 
ON THE SEA DEFENCES AT THE MARSH 
IF THEY FAILED THE RIVER FLOWS 
WOULD INCREASE BY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THIS WOULD 
DESTROY SOUTHWOLD HARBOUR A. R. THE 
BUSINESSES 
TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK I TRAVELLED 
UPSTREAM WITH MARCUS GLADWELL 
THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE HAD A BREACH 
IN THE MUD BANK WHICH PROTECTS 
THIS MARSH IF THE LOCAL GUYS 
HADN'T ACTUALLY PUT IN THE SAND 
BAGS THAT WE CAN SEE THERE THEN 
WITHIN VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME 
IT WOULD HAVE ERODED DOWN TO A 
LEVEL WHERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO REPAIR IT 
ONCE WE GET LOT OF WATER 
ON THERE ON A REGULAR BASIS THEN IT'S GOING 
TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET ANY BIG 
MACHINERY IN TO MAKE A REPAIR 
FURTHER UP THE RIVER A GLIMPSE OF 
WHAT COULD BE IN STORE FOR THE 
WHOLE AREA AT A POINT WHERE THE 
RIVER ITSELF IS BEGINNING TO GET A 
LITTLE SHALLOW 
WHEN THE NUMBERS IS ON THERE WHICH 
THE DEPTH GETS TO TWENTY EIGHT YOU WILL SEE 
THE MUD STARTING TO COME OUT OF THE 
ENGINE AND WE WILL RUN OUT OF WATER 
I WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THAT 
WE ARE LOOKING AT AN AREA THAT USED 
TO BE FARMLAND HERE IT'S ACTUALLY 
A ROAD OTHERWISE IT'S BEEN 
ERODED BY THE BANKS WHICH WERE 
ALONG HERE WHEREVER YOU SAW THE 
WOODEN POST THAT IS WHERE THEY 
BUILT THE BANKS UP ON BECAUSE OF 
THE WIND DRIVEN WAVES THEY REMOVED 
ALL OF THOSE BANKS AND THE WATER 
JUST RUNS IN AND OUT AND IT'S VERY 
DIFFICULT TO RECOVER THAT AS LAND 
THE PROBLEM IS A LARGER AREA OF 
WATER LIKE THIS GENERATES BIGGER 
WAVES WHICH COULD QUICKLY WASH AWAY 
THE DEFENCES A LARGER VOLUME OF 
WATER RUSHING IN AND OUT WITH THE 
TIDE WOULD ALSO THREATEN TO DESTROY 
THE HARBOUR WALL LOW LYING WALLS 
WILL MOSTLY BE AT RISK EVEN IN THE 
HIGHER GROUND OF SOUTHWOLD THERE 
WOULD BE PROBLEMS IT ERESABABG G. 
OT RUNS THE RED LOIN PUB 
I THINK 
BUSINESS WOULD SUFFER OBVIOUSLY 
THE MAIN A TWELVE WOULD BE FLOOD IF THE 
DESS ARE NOT SEEN TO SOON 
DEFENCES THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN 
ROUTE INTO THE TOWN THIS IS A VERY 
TOURISTY TOWN WE RELY ON PEOPLE 
COMING IN SUMMER WEEKENDS YOU 
NAME IT WE NEED THE TRADE YOU YOU THINK SOUTHWOLD COULD BE CUT OFF 
YEAH IF NOTHING WAS DONE TO THE 
DEFENCES WE WOULD BE CUT OFF 
MARCUS TOO WAS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT 
IT WOULD MEAN FOR HIS BUSINESS THE THE WORSE CASE SCENARIO IS THAT THE 
BUILDING AND THE LAND HERE GETS 
WASHED AWAY MY WIFE HAS A LITTLE 
BUSINESS JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE LIFEBOAT STATION THERE L. THINK 
MOST OF THE ALTERNATIVES WILL HAVE 
SERIOUS RAMIFICATIONS IN IS ONLY 
ONE SOLUTION REALLY THAT WORKS WELL 
FOR US THAT IS IF THE BANKS BECOME 
REINSTATED FURTHER UP THE RIVER TO 
STOP THAT WATER OVERTOPPING AND 
THEN FILLING UP THE MARSHES AND 
THEN TOTALLY ERODING THE WHOLE AREA 
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK SHOULD BE DONE I I THINK THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY SHOULD 
GIVE SOME MONEY TO DO IT AT THE 
MOMENT WE ARE STRUGGLING FOR FUNDS 
THEIR OPTION IS TO DO NOTHING WHICH 
PEOPLE IN SOUTHWOLD THINK IS NOT AN 
OPTION WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS BUSINESSES 
EVERYTHING OUR HERITAGE AS WELL 
IN STATEMENT THE ENVIRONMENT 
AGENCY SAYS IT GENUINELY 
UNDERSTANDS THE CONCERNS OF THE 
LOCAL COMMUNITY 
IT SAID IT MEANS THAT THE SEA WILL CONTINUE 
TO EAT WAY AT THE DEFENCES NO ONE 
KNOWS HOW LONG THE PROCESS WILL 
TAKE SOME THINK JUST SHORT SPACE 
OF TIME OTHERS THIRTY FORTY OR EVEN FIFTY 
YEARS EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE 
LANDSCAPE WHICH HAS DELIGHTED 
VISITORS FOR YEAR AND THE ECONOMY 
AROUND IT COULD DOES APPEAR 
DISAPPEAR IT OCCURS TO ME TO 
FIND THE VIEWER CLOSEST TO THE SEA 
E. MAIL US IN YARDS OR METRES DON'T 
SAY A STONE'S THROW FROM THE SEA 
WE ARE TACKLING YOUR QUESTIONS 
ABOUT UTILITIES FIRST UP WE HAVE 
HAD A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
HUGE THIRTY SIX MILLION FINE IMPOSED ON 
SEVERN TRENT WATER FOR LYING ABOUT 
THE LEVEL OF THEIR LEAKAGE AND 
MISLEADING CUSTOMERS MANY PEOPLE 
HAVE WRITTEN TO ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO 
THAT MAUN 
THAT MONEY 
WE WERE TALKING TO THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE EARLIER THIS WEEK THE 
MONEY GOES INTO A CONSOLIDATED FUND 
THAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S BANK 
ACCOUNT ALL TAX REVENUE GOES INTO 
THE CONSOLIDATED FUND ALONG WITH 
MONEY FROM CERTAIN FINES LIKE THIS 
ONE THE GOVERNMENT USES IT TO 
SPEND WITH ALL OF IT'S SPENDING 
COMES FROM THE CONSOLIDATED I AM 
AFRAID THE FINES DO NOT GO BACK TO 
THE CONSUMER OR THE REGULATOR 
WE WILL STICK FROM WATER TO GAS AND 
ELECTRICITY WHAT WE USED TO CALL 
THE UTILITIES WELCOME ROBIN 
HAMMOND FROM THE GAS AND ENERGY 
WATCH IN THE NICEST POSSIBLE WAY 
YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED INDEED WE 
ARE TO BE AMALGAMATED TO FORM A NEW 
BODY WHICH WILL BE LOOKING AT 
BROADER CONSUMER ISSUES SO WE WILL 
NO LONGER BE DEALING WITH JUST GAS 
AND ELECTRICITY 
IF I AM TRYING TO 
WORK OUT WHO PAYS YOUR SALARY AND 
TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS ABOUT YOUR 
VIEWS OR SOMETIMES INDEPENDENTS 
WHO PAYS FOR YOU 
BASICALLY THE 
CONSUMER PAYS FOR US IN A 
CONVOLUTED WAY IT'S PART OF WHAT 
THEY PAY FOR GAS AND ELECTRICITY 
THAT GOES THROUGH TO THE GOVERNMENT 
IN A LICENSE FEE AND THAT GOES TO 
ENERGYWATCH 
DEREK SAYS CAN YOU ENERGYWATCH ANSWER ONE QUESTION HOW DO YOU 
CHANGE YOUR SUPPLIER WHEN YOU GET 
THE ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE SAME 
WIRES AND GAS THROUGH THE SAME 
PIPES 
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION THERE PIPES IS A COMPLEX MECHANISM FOR WORKING 
OUT WHICH COMPANIES HAVE USED HOW 
MUCH ELECTRICITY OR GAS WE ALL 
HAVE METRES IN OUR HOUSES SO THAT 
RECORDS HOW MUCH WE USE AND OVER 
THE COURSE OF A YEAR OR FOURTEEN MONTH 
PERIOD ALL OF THAT DATA IS FED 
INTO A SYSTEM AND IT'S WORKED OUT 
THEN WHICH COMPANY HAS USED SO MUCH 
GAS AND ELECTRICITY 
LIKE A GIANT 
METRE INDEED 
SO MANY OF THE METRE INDEED COMPANIES OPERATE LIKE A FRANCHISE 
IN A WAY IF THEIR BUSINESS IS MORE 
EFFICIENT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
FLOG IT A BIT CHEAPER 
IF THE 
EFFICIENCY ARE BETTER OR THEY CAN 
BUY IT ON THE WHOLE SALE MARKET AT 
A CHEAPER PRICE 
BRIAN STAIN IT'S 
HAS BEEN LOOKING TO CHANGE HIS 
BRIAN STAPLES HAS BEEN LOOKING TO 
CHANGE HIS ENERGY SUPPLY NPOWER 
WON'T LET HIM CHANGE TO THE PLAN 
BECAUSE HE IS AN EXISTING CUSTOM WE 
ARE THEM 
THIS ISN'T FAIR 
HE IS RIGHT WHY 
SHOULD AN EXISTING CUSTOMER BE 
PENALISED IN THAT WAY IF YOU ARE A 
NEW CUSTOMER YOU GO TO NPOWER AND 
YOU CAN GO ON THAT CHEAPER RATE IF 
YOU ARE AN EXISTING CUSTOMER YOU 
CAN'T WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IF YOU 
ARE FED UP LOOK AROUND SEE IF YOU 
CAN FIND A BETTER DEAL THAT IS 
CHEAPER 
I RANG NPOWER ON BEHALF OF CHEAPER BRIAN I WASN'T LOOKING OUT OF THE 
WINDOW ALL MORNING THEY SAID A 
NICE MAN CALLED NICK SAID GET BRIAN 
TO RING HIM WE WILL LOOK INTO 
SWITCHING HIM HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
A DEAL DOES APPEAR TO BE AN 
INTRODETECTORY OFFER ACROSS THE 
RANGE WHETHER IT'S MOBILE PHONES 
THIS GETS THE GOAT OF PEOPLE 
PEOPLE IN BOARDROOMS SHOULD LIVE IN 
THE REAL WORLD ABOUT THIS 
INDEED THEY SHOULD WOULD SAY IF 
THERE IS ANYONE ELSE WITH NPOWER 
PERHAPS THEY WOULD LIKE TO GIVE 
NICK A CALL WHEN I CALLED N. POWER 
TO CHECK THAT INDEED THEY HADN'T 
CHANGED THIS I GOT A COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT ANSWER TO YOURSELF 
MARK SAYS I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT 
GETTING BETTER PRICES FOR MY 
MOTHER'S GAS AND ELECTRIC L. USED 
THE USWITCH WEBSITE ON READING THE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS IT SEEMS TO 
SHOW THAT THERE COULD BE A CHARGE 
TO THE CUSTOMER IF THE SUPPLY WAS 
CUT IN AN EMERGENCY COULD THAT BE CORRECT 
A NO THAT IS NOT RIGHT CORRECT IF THERE IS A NATURAL DISASTER A 
STORM OR SOMETHING AND A CONSUMER 
FINDS HIMSELF OFF SUPPLY THEN THE 
DUTY AND THE COST OF GETTING THE 
SUPPLY BACK RESTS WITH THE 
DISTRIBUTOR OR THE GAS TRANSPORTER 
AND ALL THAT IS PAID FOR THROUGH 
OUR GAS AND ELECTRICITY CHARGES IT 
IS REALLY ONLY IF THE CONSUMER HAS 
BEEN AT FAULT IF THERE ARE MONIES 
THAT YOU OWE YOUR SUPPLIER AND YOU 
HAVE NOT PAID THEM OR YOU HAVE 
BEEN MESSING AROUND WITH THE METER 
HEAVEN FORBID AND YOU COULD FIND 
YOURSELF LIABLE 
IAN CARTWRIGHT 
FROM DEVON SAYS GOOD AFTERNOON 
GOOD AFTERNOON TO HIM HE SAYS 
THEY ESTIMATE THE READING AS AT 
THE PRICE CHANGE DATE AND MY 
EXPERIENCE IS THAT THIS 
APPORTIONING IS USUALLY 
INACCURATE I WOULD AGREE I AM 
GOING THROUGH THE SAME ARGUMENT 
WITH MY UTILITY COMPANY RIGHT NOW 
L. L. SUGGEST THAT WHEN CONSUMERS KNOW 
THAT THERE IS ABOUT TO BE A PRICE 
CHANGE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE VERY 
SAD THING TO DO BUT HAVE A LOOK AT 
THE METER ON THE DAY THE PRICE 
CHANGE COMES INTO EFFECT AND MAKE 
A NOTE OF THE READINGS AND SEND 
THEM THROUGH TO THE SUPPLIER MOST 
OF THEM HAVE SCHEME WHEREBY YOU 
CAN DO THIS ONLINE OR PICK UP THE 
PHONE BUT DOUBLE DOUBLE CHECK 
YOUR BILL WHETHER YOU HAVE DONE 
THAT WILL NOT 
AROUND ADAM WILL 
BE HERE LATER IT WILL ALL MAKE 
SENSE THEN TO WHOM WILL IT MAKE 
SENSE IT IS SEVENTY YEARS SINCE THE 
ERCOLE FAMILY STARTED THEIR CO 
OPERATIVE IN THE PIEDMONT REGION OF 
ITALY THEY INTRODUCED THEIR SACLA 
PRODUCTS INTO THE U. K. AND THEY ARE

NOT THEIR SCHOOL IN FACT HALF ARE 
FROM STATE SCHOOLS HALF FROM 
PRIVATE EVEN THE TEACHER IS FROM 
ELSEWHERE ELSEWHERE I DO APOLOGISE WE SEEM TO BE 
RUNNING THE WRONG REPORT L. AM TOLD THAT WE NOW HAVE THE RIGHT ONE 
SACLA BASICALLY IS A CO OPERATIVE 
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT 
FOOD AND WHO CAME TOGETHER TO 
BRING THE VERY BEST ITALIAN FOOD 
TOGETHER THE BUSINESS WAS FOUNDED 
BY MR. AND MRS. ERCOLE THEY PASSED 
THE BUSINESS OVER TO THEIR TWO SONS 
THE SECOND SON IS STILL A PRESIDENT 
AND NOW THE CHILDREN OF THE 
SECOND GENERATION ARE TAKING OVER 
AND STARTED TO RUN THE BUSINESS 
PIEDMONT IS A VERY FERTILE REGION 
IN THE NORTH OF ITALY IN THE 
FOOTHILLS OF THE ALPS SO THE SOIL 
IS GREAT FOR GROWING FRUIT AND 
VEGETABLES THAT IS HOW WE CAME TO 
BE LOCATED THERE ALL OF OUR 
PRODUCTS ARE MADE WITH ITALIAN 
INGREDIENTS THEY'RE MADE IN ITALY 
IN PIEDMONT SO EVERYTHING WE SELL 
IS GENUINE REAL ITALIAN FOOD OUR 
BASIL IS GROWN IN OUR FIELDS AN 
AMAZING SIGHT TO SEE THE BRIGHT 
BLUE SKY AND YOU ARE THE TRULY 
NEEDY PIN BATTLE THE CENTRE OF THE 
BASIL FILLS THE AIR OUR TOMATOES 
COME FROM THE SOUTH OF ITALY YOU 
ARE A KNEE DEEP IN BASIL OUR 
OLIVES COME FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF 
ITALY TOO YOU ARE 
DEEPER 
ITALY TOO YOU ARE KNEE DEEPER THE PASSION OF THE SACLA FAMILY TO 
SHARE AND CELEBRATE ITALIAN FOOD 
WAS WHAT INSPIRED IS VERY EVOCATIVE 
BOOK FOR US DEEP WE WERE 
DELIGHTED THAT THE DOYENNE OF 
ITALIAN FOOD HERE IN THE U. K. AGREED 
TO TRAVEL AROUND THE LESSER KNOWN 
REGIONS OF ITALY REGIONS LIKE 
PIEDMONT AND ALSO THAT A LEADING 
BRITISH STILL LIFE ARTIST AGREED TO 
JOURNEY WITH US AND CAPTURE THE 
RICHNESS OF THE ITALIAN FOOD AND 
ART AND CULTURE SO WE HAVE A 
BEAUTIFUL BOOK THE PAINTER AND 
THE COOK WOMEN IN BUSINESS AND 
WOMEN IN SACLA IS A BIT OF A FAMILY 
TRADITION IT WAS A LADY THAT 
FOUNDED THE BUSINESS SEVENTY YEARS AGO 
ALONGSIDE HER HUSBAND AND 
APPARENTLY SHE WAS VERY MUCH IN 
CHARGE OF THE PURSE STRINGS AND 
HER TWO GRANDDAUGHTERS WORK IN THE 
BUSINESS IN ITALY TODAY L. L. JUST 
HAPPENED TO BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO WORK 
HERE IN THE U. K. AND LOOK AFTER THEIR 
BUSINESS HERE HAPPEN TO BE LUCKY 
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE 
FOCUSED AND THAT WE KNOW WHERE 
WE'RE GOING AND WE WORK WITH 
PASSION AND ENERGY AND WE HAVE FUN 
IT'S A VERY BUOYANT BUSINESS FOR US 
HELPED BY THE FACT THAT BRITISH 
PEOPLE JUST LOVE ANYTHING ITALIAN 
WHETHER THAT'S FOOTBALL FASHION OR 
FOOD OUR MARKET HAS BECOME QUITE 
STRONG WE TURN OVER ABOUT THIRTY FIVE 
MILLION NOW AS A BUSINESS WE HAVE 
VERY DOMINANT MARKET SHARE IN PESTO 
SAUCE BUT WE HAVE A WHOLE RANGE OF 
OTHER ITALIAN PRODUCTS TOO THE 
SECRETS OF OUR SUCCESS LIES IN THE 
QUALITY OF OUR INGREDIENTS AND THE 
AUTHENTICITY OF OUR RECIPES AND 
ALSO IN THE SACLA FAMILY WHO 
OWNED AND RUN THE BUSINESS WITH 
SUCH PASSION AND OF COURSE THE 
TEAM OF PEOPLE THAT WORK WITH US 
THE ARMY TOP BRASS ARE AT EDINBURGH 
CASTLE TODAY FOR A NUMBER OF EVENTS 
CELEBRATING ONE HUNDRED YEARS SINCE THE 
FORMATION OF THE TERRITORIAL ARMY 
THE T. A. IT HAS THIRTY SIX THOUSAND SOLDIERS 
MANY OF WHOM HAVE TO COMBINE 
CIVILIAN AND MILITARY JOBS HOW ON 
EARTH TO EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS COPE 
WHEN THE CALL COMES TO SERVE 
WELCOME SERGEANT HARRY SOWERBY TO 
TELL US ALL ABOUT IT DID YOU COME 
WILLINGLY OR DID SOMEONE IN A BIG 
SUIT OR A BIG HAT TELL YOU TO GET 
HERE QUICKLY 
A WAS PHONED UP THIS 
MORNING BY SOMEONE IN A BIG HAT A A GENERAL 
THE COUPLE DOWN FROM THERE GENERAL THE COLONEL I WAS PHONED 
WELCOME IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY 
THING TO WORK OUT HOW YOU DO WHAT 
YOU DO WHAT IS YOUR JOB IN 
CIVILIAN LIFE AND WHAT IS YOUR JOB 
I. N. THE MILITARY I AM A PLATOON 
SERGEANT IN THE INFANTRY AND I RUN 
A FITNESS COMPANY HERE IN LONDON A A BUSMAN'S HOLIDAY IN A WAY 
YES A 
LOT OF THE STUFF WE LEARN FROM THE 
T. A. WE USED IN THE COMPANY ITSELF 
IS IT A CASE OF THE GRASS IS 
GREENER WHEN YOU'RE ON CIVILIAN 
DUTY DO YOU WANT TO GET SERVING 
AND WHEN YOU ARE SERVING IN 
DANGEROUS THEATRES OF WAR DO YOU 
THINK ABOUT YOUR LIFE BACK HOME 
WHEN YOU'RE ON OPERATIONS YOU'RE 
WITH EVERYBODY AND IT IS JUST 
DARREN LOT OF BORING BITS BUT YOU 
KNOW YOU CAN TRUST EVERYBODY WHO IS 
AROUND YOU AND ALL YOU WANT TO DO 
IS COME HOME AND THEN WHEN YOU 
COME HOME YOU COULD HAVE MISSED 
THAT CAMARADERIE BECAUSE AS SOON 
AS YOU STEP OUT OF THE BARRACKS 
YOUR BY YOURSELF YOU'RE NOT PART 
OF THE SOLDIERS BEING AROUND YOU 
ALL THE TIME YOU LOSE THAT AND 
THAT IS QUITE HARD TO GET OVER 
WORKING LUNCH REGULARS LIKE TO BE 
SHOWN THE NUTS AND BOLTS HELL ON 
EARTH 
DID YOUR FIRST JOB HOW DID YOUR EMPLOYERS DEAL WITH YOUR 
PHONE CALL WHAT HAPPENED 
WE KNEW 
THAT THERE WAS A CHANCE THAT OUR 
REGIMENT WOULD BE CALLED UP TO GO 
TO IRAQ IN TWO THOUSAND THREE BECAUSE A LOT OF 
T. A. UNITS WERE STARTING TO BE CALLED 
UP SO IT WAS NOT A MASSIVE 
SURPRISE SO WE WERE SORT OF 
WARNING OUR EMPLOYERS WAY BEFORE WE 
GOT ANY LETTERS IF ONLY TO SOFTEN 
THE PILL SOMEWHAT TO SAY THERE'S A 
CHANCE WE COULD BE GOING TO IRAQ 
IT DID NOT COME AS SUCH A SHOCK 
WHAT WAS YOUR JOB AT THE TIME 
A I 
USED TO MANAGE A WAREHOUSE FOR A 
FURNITURE COMPANY WHEN I 
EVENTUALLY TOLD THEM THEY WERE 
RIGHT BEHIND ME I USED TO L. 
GOT MY JOB BACK WHEN I CAME BACK 
NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER 
WE GO THERE 
IS A LOT OF POLITICAL DEBATE ABOUT 
THIS AND I AM SURE THERE ARE 
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION IN THE 
WORKPLACE BUT IS IT CLEAR TO 
EMPLOYERS AND TO SERVING PEOPLE IN 
THE FORCES WHAT THE MONEY 
AVAILABLE IS IS THERE A STRICT 
ROUTINE ABOUT WHO GETS WHAT AND 
WHERE 
SPEAKING FOR MY PERSONAL WHERE EXPERIENCES MY EMPLOYER WENT 
THROUGH A COMPANY CALLED SABER 
THEY ARE THE PEOPLE YOU NEED TO 
FUND UP AND SPEAK TO IF YOU HAVE 
ANY ISSUES WITH ONE OF YOUR 
EMPLOYEES BEING CALLED UP TO GO ON 
OPERATIONS I MEAN YOU CAN 
ACTUALLY IF YOU ARE VITAL TO THAT 
COMPANY YOUR COMPANY CAN ACTUALLY 
SAY WE WOULD RATHER HE DIDN'T GO 
BECAUSE HE IS THE ONLY PERSON THAT 
KNOWS HOW TO USE HE COMPUTER WE 
WOULD BE USELESS WITHOUT HIM AND 
THE ARMY WOULD VERY OFTEN SAY YOU 
CAN KEEP HIM BUT MOST OF US WANT 
TO GO THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRAINED 
TO DO 
THANK YOU IT IS ONE HUNDRED 
YESTERDAY THANK YOU FOR SPENDING 
PART OF YOUR DAY WITH WORKING LUNCH 
AND NOW DAVID BUIK FROM B. C. G. 
PARTNERS IS HERE TO HAVE A LOOK AT 
THE WEEK AHEAD ON THE MARKETS 
LET'S CRACK ON ON MONDAY THERE ARE 
FIGURES FROM SAGE L. SUPPOSE IF THE 
ECONOMY IS SLOWING DOWN PEOPLE 
WILL BE INVESTING LESS IN BUSINESS 
SUPPORT SOFTWARE 
IT IS VERY MUCH A 
BAROMETER OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND 
YOU KNOW THEY DO AN AWFUL LOT OF 
BUSINESS WITH THE BANKS BUT ALSO 
WITH SOME OF THE DRUG COMPANIES SO 
ONE WOULD SUSPECT THAT WE'RE NOT 
GOING TO SEE BRILLIANT FIGURES FROM 
THEM IT IS NOT SO MUCH THE FIGURES 
IT WILL BE THE OUTLOOK 
ON TUESDAY THERE ARE FIGURES FROM 
BURBERRY CARPHONE WAREHOUSE 
DEBENHAMS AND TESCO THIS IS AT A 
TIME WHEN RETAIL SHARES 
YESTERDAY I LOOKED AT HOW MUCH 
VALUE D. S. G. FROM MEMORY I THINK 
THEY MIGHT HAVE LOST SIXTY PER CENT OF THEIR 
VALUE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
MILLIONS AND VALUE MILLIONS OF POUNDS 
JUST GONE YES YES JUST LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE 
NOT MAKING THEIR SALES FORECAST 
LOOKING AT THIS LOT NEXT WEEK 
BURBERRY THE TRADING STATEMENT 
WHICH I THINK IT IS I THINK THAT 
IS ALMOST IMMUNE TO RECESSION 
UNLIKE ME THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE 
HAVING ANY PROBLEMS RAISING CASH 
CARPHONE WAREHOUSE AGAIN THERE 
HAS BEEN A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER 
AN AMERICAN COMPANY MIGHT BUY INTO 
THEM I THINK THEY DO A FANTASTIC 
JOB WITH THAT COMPANY THEY'RE 
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW IDEAS 
DEBENHAM'S BOB TEMPLEMAN'S GOT A 
SERIOUS PROBLEM VERY MUCH IN THE 
SAME OLD I'M AFRAID AS SOME OF 
THE OTHER COMPANIES SUCH AS D. S. G. 
INTERNATIONAL NOT SELLING THE 
RIGHT THINGS SHARE PRICE HAS 
HALVED IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS 
TESCO THE DADDY OF THEM ALL THIRTY ONE PER CENT 
OF THE SUPERMARKETS UNFORTUNATELY 
FOR TESCO SHARE PRICE HAS COME 
DOWN BY ABOUT TWENTY THREE PER CENT IN THE LAST SIX 
MONTHS FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT 
MARGINS ON NARROWING COSTS ARE 
GOING UP AND FOOD IS GOING UP FRESH 
AND EASY IN CALIFORNIA IT WOULD BE 
NICE TO SEE HOW THEY ARE GETTING ON 
OVER THERE 
THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE 
CALLED 
EVEN IF THAT BOBS AROUND AT TWO IT 
IS SOMETHING TO STAY ON THE RIGHT 
SIDE OFF W. H. SMITH'S WOULD BE 
NEVER DOWNSIZING OPERATION 
PRUDENTIAL I THINK IS VERY SOLID 
GOING FORWARD IN THE UNITED STATES 
FRED SAYS MY LOUNGE IS THIRTY METRES 
FROM THE EDGE OF SOUTHAMPTON WATER 
WATER THAT IS THE CLOSEST WE HAVE 
FOUND SO FAR IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU 
KNOW IS A TEENAGER YOU WILL KNOW 
THAT THIS IS REVISION TIME IT IS 
WELL KNOWN THAT DEANO JUST LOVE 
REVISING AND THAT THEY CAN'T GET 
ENOUGH OF IT BUT TEACHING COULD IN 
FACT BE A BIG BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY 
WE WILL REVISE THIS REPORT NOW 
BECAUSE WE SAW A LITTLE BIT OF IT 
EARLIER THE COMPANY IS CALLED 
JUSTIN CRAIG IT WON FINANCIAL 
BACKING FROM A GROUP WITH DEEP 
POCKETS 
THE KEY THING HERE IS THE POCKETS NEUROTRANSMITTER 
AN A LEVEL NEUROTRANSMITTER BIOLOGY CLASS AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL 
IN BERKSHIRE CONCENTRATING ON 
PREPARATIONS FOR THE EXAMS IN JUNE 
BUT IT'S THE HOLIDAYS AND THIS IS 
NOT THE SCHOOL IN FACT HALF OF 
FROM STATE SCHOOLS HALF FROM 
PRIVATE EVEN THE TEACHER IS FROM 
ELSEWHERE INSTEAD THE STUDENTS 
PARENTS HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF 
POUNDS FOR SEVERAL DAYS OF 
INTENSIVE REVISION THE STUDENTS' 
PARENTS 
IF A WAS AT HOME I WOULD PARENTS GET DISTRACTED A LOT MORE 
THERE IS 
NO WAY I WOULD BE DOING EIGHT HOURS 
OF REVISION AT HOME ON MY OWN IT 
IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN HERE I CAN 
GET IT IN BURSTS WE HAVE GOT THE 
TEACHER ON HAND WHO IS VERY 
KNOWLEDGEABLE HE PROVIDES US WITH 
THE MATERIAL 
COS IT FEEL DIFFERENT 
TO YOUR SCHOOL 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
IT IS SMALLER GROUPS AND THE 
TEACHERS HERE THEY ARE ON HAND SO 
THEY CAN TALK TO YOU ONE ON ONE IT IT IS A SMALL CLASS 
YEAH IT WORKS 
QUITE WELL WORKING AS A SMALL GROUP 
AS YOU GET MORE ATTENTION AND YOU 
CAN ASK YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS L. 
FIND IF I HAVE REVISED AT HOME I 
MIGHT HAVE REVISED FOR THINGS THAT 
I ALREADY KNEW 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
IS THAT THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN OVER 
THIS SCHOOL FOR THE HOLIDAYS FOR A 
RESIDENTIAL COURSE TEACHING THESE 
REVISION CLASSES THERE ARE NEARLY 
THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS WHO ARE TAKING THEM 
HERE AND FOR THINKING IS THAT THIS 
IS A BUSINESS WHICH COULD MUSHROOM 
CAN YOU JUST REMIND ME OF HOW MANY 
DIFFERENT SUBJECTS WE'RE COVERING 
THIS IS GEORGE ADAMS FROM PIPER 
PRIVATE EQUITY AN INVESTMENT FARM 
HE IS KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON 
PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE HE HAS BOUGHT 
A CONTROLLING INTEREST THERE ARE 
THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS ON THE BOOKS THIS 
YEAR IN DIFFERENT TEACHING CENTRES 
AND AS A RESULT OF THE TAKEOVER 
GEORGE IS FUNNELLING IN HALF A 
MILLION POUNDS TO SPEND ON 
EXPANDING 
WE SEE THIS AS A GREY MARKET WHERE 
PARENTS WANT TO BUILD THE 
CONFIDENCE OF THEIR CHILDREN 
JUSTIN CRAIG HAS A VERY LONG 
ESTABLISHED RECORD OF THAT 
THE EXPANSION PLAN FOR JUSTIN CRAIG 
IS IMPRESSIVE IT USES THIRTEEN CENTRES 
AT THE MOMENT DURING THE HOLIDAYS 
AND HALF TERMS WITH A TYPICAL 
CHARGE OF FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MAKING FOR MURNOVER 
OF ONE POINT FOUR MILLION N. FIVE YEARS THEY 
HOPE TO BE WORKING FROM SIXTY CENTRES 
REACHING OVER TEN MILLION OF 
TURNOVER WHAT SORT OF A RETURN ARE 
YOU LOOKING FOR YOU ARE LOOKING TO 
MAKE MONEY 
INDEED L. WOULDN'T 
DISCLOSE THE ABSOLUTE AMOUNT WE ARE 
LOOKING TO MAKE BUT WE WOULD LOOK 
TO ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUES THROUGH 
THE PROCESS WE BRING TO THE 
BUSINESS 
SO WHERE DOES THE HEAD BUSINESS OF OPERATIONS THINK THAT THE GROWTH 
IS GOING TO COME FROM 
WE ARE 
CURRENTLY BASED HEAVILY IN THE 
SOUTH EAST JUSTIN CRAIG TAKES 
THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS ANNUALLY FROM THAT 
AREA WHEN WE DO EXPAND THAT WE 
EXPECT THE FIGURE TO INCREASE YOU YOU HAVE THE POT OF MONEY THAT HAS BEEN 
INVESTED IN THE BUSINESS HOW CAN 
YOU USE THAT 
IT WILL ENABLE US TO 
MOVE INTO MORE PREMISES THIS WILL 
MAKE US TAKE ON MORE STAFF TO 
IMPROVE JUSTIN CRAIG WE ARE NOW 
ABLE TO TAKE AN A SCHOOL'S LIASON 
MANAGER WHO WILL DEAL WITH THE 
SCHOOLS ON ALL ISSUES AND THE 
PARENTS AND THE STUDENTS TO MAKE 
SURE THE QUALITY OF EXPERIENCE IS 
ENHANCED EVEN FURTHER 
YOU ARE 
GOING TO NEED NEW TEACHER WHO WANT 
TO BE GOOD AND NEW VENUES WHICH YOU 
WANT TO WORK THERE ARE PITFALLS ON 
THE WAY WHEN YOU EXPAND AND YOU 
MIGHT GET IT WRONG 
ABSOLUTELY ANY BUSINESS LOOKING TO 
EXPAND NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT THE 
ISSUES VERY KAUFLLY WE WOULD BE 
FOOLISH NOT TO WE ARE STARTING 
FROM A SOUND PLATFORM WE HAVE BEEN 
DOING THIS FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS THIS 
INVESTMENT ENABLE US TO SET UP THE 
OR FINE TUNE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO 
MAKE SURE THAT QUALITY OF 
PERSONALISED SERVICE THAT WE GIVE 
OUR JUSTIN CRAIG STUDENTS CONTINUES 
RIGHT THE BIGGER YOU GET THE MORE 
YOU ARE NOTICED AND THE MORE PEOPLE 
ARE GOING TO ASK THE QUESTION HOW 
CAN YOU JUSTIFY KIDS BEING ABLE TO 
BUY AN ADVANTAGE IN THE EXAMS 
IF YOU ASK ANY PARENT IF YOU WANT 
YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER TO GIVE SOME 
ADVANTAGE IN LIFE WOULD YOU GIVE 
IT THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS YES WE 
ARE OFFERING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO 
EVERYONE OUR COURSE IS RANGED FROM 
THREE HUNDRED TO TWELVE HUNDRED IT'S AMAZING A 
PARENT SAID TO ME THEY ARE GOING 
TO FOREGO HOME IMPROVEMENTS TO SEND 
THEIR CHILDREN ON THE COURSE AND 
GIVE THEM THAT UPLIFT ANOTHER ANOTHER SCIENCE CLASS BUT THIS ONE IS 
WORKING TOWARDS GCSES THE COURSES 
ARE SOLD AS CHEAPER THAN ONE TO ONE 
TUTORING AND MORE ENJOYABLE THE 
AIM IS TO TURN EXAM SUCCESS INTO A 
MONEY SPINNER BECAUSE IF THIS 
HOLIDAY REVISION DOES THE TRICK 
THEN BROTHER SISTERS AND FRIENDS 
COULD BE BACK HERE NEXT YEAR IF 
YOU ARE A BUSINESS STUDIES STUDENT 
AND PERHAPS MULTITASKING TOO MUCH 
YOU CAN WATCH THAT REPORT AGAIN ON 
THE WEBSITE WE ARE RAISING FINANCE 
FLOG OFF OUR FULL BACK CATALOGUE OF 
OUR LUNCH LESSONS SORE NEEDS 
SWEATY CLOTHES AND AN ALL OVER ACHE 
THAT LASTS FOR WEEKS THIS IS WHAT 
THE PEOPLE RUNNING IN THE LONDON 
MARATHON CAN LOOK FORWARD TO IT'S 
ALSO GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF 
TROUBLED PERSONAL FINANCES YOU 
WILL KNOW GARY WEBB FROM EASTENDERS 
AND THE BILL HE IS RUNNING THIS 
WEEKEND'S MARATHON FOR MARRY CUREY 
CANCER CARE HOW MUCH DO YOU HAPPEN 
TO RAISE 
IT'S IT DEPENDS L. DON'T 
GO OUT THERE MAKING THE CAN L. AM 
RAISING AWARENESS IF PEOPLE SEE 
THE SHIRT OF MARIE CURIE CANCER 
CARE AND ALSO WORKING WITH WOMEN 
AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE L. KNOW 
THAT PEOPLE MIGHT PUT A FACE TO THE 
CHARITY AND WANT TO INVESTIGATE 
MORE AND GET OUT THERE AND SAY 
THESE GUYS ARE DOING THE TOP WORK 
AND BE AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON 
YOU HAVE RUN MARATHON BEFORE I I DID 
I RUN IT LAST YEAR I WONDER 
WITH THE WORRIES ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
YOU HAVE SEEN PEOPLE MORE RELUCTANT 
TO GIVE TO CHARITY 
IT'S PROBABLY 
THE CASE WE WOULD THINK THAT WAY 
THE GREAT BRITISH SPIRIT ALWAYS 
SURPRISES US L. AM SURE WITH THE 
CHILDREN IN NEED RECENTLY AND THE 
SPORT RELIEF WE WOULD PROBABLY SEE 
THE FIGURES THE SAME FOR ME WHEN 
I WAS GOING THROUGH FINANCIAL 
CRISIS AND TROUBLES WHEN YOU LOOK 
AT THE CHARITY SIDE OF IT AND YOU 
LOOK AT THE CHARITY I AM RAISING 
FOR AND ALL OF THE OTHER GREAT 
CHARITIES IN THE COUNTRY IT PUT MY 
BANKRUPTCY INTO PERSPECTIVE AND 
REALISE THIS IS NOT LIFE OR DEATH 
FOR ME AND REALISE I AM NOT IN A 
TROUBLED SITUATION AT HOME YOU YOU DON'T MIND TALKING ABOUT THAT YOU 
HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT THAT IN THE PAST 
I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU THOUGHT 
THAT EXERCISE WAS A WAY OF 
IMPROVING YOUR FINANCES 
MENT 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT I HAD 
GONE BANKRUPT AND WE KNEW WE WERE 
GOING TO GET OUR HOUSE REPOSSESSED 
THAT A WORRYING TIME THERE COULD 
BE THE INCLINATION TO BURY YOUR 
HEAD IN THE SAND OR GO TO THE 
BOTTLE I DECIDED LET'S GET OUR 
HEADS TOGETHER LET'S BE POSITIVE 
AND PROACTIVE PART OF THAT WAS TO 
START RUNNING AND KEEP FOCUSED ON 
WHAT WERE THE IMPORTANT THINGS OF 
WHAT WE WANTED TO ACHIEVE AND BEING 
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY MORE ACTIVE 
AND ON THE BALL THAN I WAS BEFORE 
PART OF THAT PROCESS WAS RUNNING 
WHICH LED ME TO BE AWARE OF THE 
CHARITIES AND WHAT I COULD DO FOR 
THEM VIA MY RUNNING WHEN THESE BIG 
THINGS CAME UP LIKE REPOSSESSION 
AND THEM SAYING YOU WERE BANKRUPT I 
WOULD USE THAT TO GO OUT AND CLEAR 
MY MIND AND SEE WHAT WE COULD DO TO 
ATTACK THE SITUATION AND MAKE IT 
BETTER 
IT'S BIZARRE THEY SAY YOU BETTER CAN'T RUN INTO YOUR PROBLEMS BUT 
YOU CAN YOU RUN AWITH A AND 
YOU CAN RUN BACK INTO THEM L. FOUND I COULD 
DEAL WITH THEM BETTER HAVING HAD 
THE TWO OR THREE HOURS OUT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE GO THROUGH THAT 
IT'S NOT JUST A FINANCIAL ONE IT'S 
EMOTIONAL WHAT WOULD BE YOUR 
ADVICE APART FROM RUNNING MY MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO KEEP THE 
CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION OPEN IF 
YOU FORESEE DANGER AHEAD WHAT WE 
WENT THROUGH TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO 
MAY HAVE BEEN THE LULL BEFORE THE 
STORM WE REALISED WITH ANY OF YOUR 
CREDIT COMPANIES THE BANKS AND 
MORTGAGE COMPANY GET THE CHANNELS 
OF COMMUNICATION OPEN LET THEM 
KNOW THE SITUATION THEY WILL BE 
AWARE THERE COULD BE TROUBLE AAHEAD 
AND YOU CAN WORK THROUGH IT YOU YOU HAVE COME THROUGH IT 
I HAVE 
FINISHED WORKING ON HOLBY CITY 
WERE YOU HAVING AN ACCIDENT

WAS HAVING AN OPERATION I WAS AN 
ADCTED GAMBLER WHICH DOESN'T SOUND

A CASUALTY EPISODE WAITING TO 
HAPPEN WE ARE TALKING UTILITIES 
THIS WEEK ROBIN HAMMOND HAS 
DECIDED TO STAY AFTER HIS LAST 
EXPERIENCE FROM THE CONSUMER 
WATCHDOG ENERGYWATCH YOU HAVE DONE 
A LOT OF HOMEWORK MR. HPATEL ASKS 
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE UTILITY COMPANY 
IN THIS CASE NPOWER WHICH KEEPS 
COMING UP IN HIS WORDS 
COMPLY WITH THE ENERGY OMBUDSMAN'S 
FINAL DECISION WHAT CAN HE DO IF HE 
FINDS THAT THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT 
BUT THERE TO PROTECT THE SIX MEMBER 
COMPANIES COMPANIES THE ENERGY OMBUDSMAN IS SUPPOSED TO 
BE A SAFETY NET IF YOU CAN'T GET A 
S. A. T.'S FACTORORY RESULT FROM THE 
SUPPLIER YOU CAN GO TO THEM 
DECISION OF THE OMBUDSMAN IS FINAL 
AS FAR AS THE SUPPLIER IS CONCERN 
BUT NOT THE CONSUMER IF YOU FEEL 
HAVE YOU A CASE YOU CAN TAKE IT TO 
THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT FOR MOST OF 
US IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE OF COST 
AND TIME WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS 
IF THIS PARTICULAR CONSUMER HASN'T 
BEEN TO US GIVE US A RING AT 
ENERGYWATCH AND LET US HAVE A LOOK 
IT MAY WELL BE THAT WE CAN FIND 
SOMETHING THAT NO ONE HAS LOOKED 
OUGHT AND WE CAN GET ON TO THE 
COMPANY WE MAY BE ABLE TO CHANGE 
SOMEONE'S MIND 
WE HEARD AT THE 
START OF THE PROGRAMME HOW BIG 
ENERGY COMPANIES ARE GIVING MONEY 
TO PEOPLE WHO FIND IT HARD TO PAY 
BILLS WE ALSO KNOW THAT NO COMPANY 
IS WRONG ALL THE TIME WE NEED TO 
STRESS THAT CONSUMER ARE SOMETIMES 
WRONG IN THE TERMS OF TRYING TO BE 
FAIR ABOUT THING SOMETIMES 
CONSUMERS MAKE MISTAKES WE CAN MAKE 
THAT POINT LET'S MOVE ON JACKIE 
SAYS SLE IS HAVING TROUBLE WITH 
SCOTTISH POWER L. HAVE A DUAL METRE 
BUT ALL THE BILLS ONLY HAVE ONE 
METRE READING L. HAVE WRITTEN TO 
THEM EVERY TIME AND E. MAILED THEM 
WITH BOTH READINGS UP UNTIL NOW 
THEY IGNORE ME NOW THEY USE A BILL 
BUT WITH THE UNITS FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX WHAT 
KIND OF A PICKLE IS THIS 
A RIGHT 
PICKLE BY THE SOUNDS OF IT IF 
SCOTTISH POWER ARE LISTENING THEY 
MAY THE WANT TO LISTEN TO THAT IF 
NOT CONSUMER MAY WANT TO COME TO US 
IF YOU HAVE BEEN SUPPLYING METRE 
READINGS TO YOUR COMPANY HAVE YOU 
BEEN DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO 
TRY AND GET AN ACCURATE BILL BUT 
STILL YOUR SUPPLIER MESSES THAT UP 
AND CAN'T GET IT RIGHT THEN NOW 
UNDER A VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT THAT 
THE SUPPLIERS HAVE THEY ARE NOT 
ABLE TO BACKBILL YOU MORE THAN ONE 
YEAR SO SCOTTISH POWER SHOULD BE 
TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION SHE SHE HAS PUT A DATE IN HERE JACKIE MAY 
WELL CALL ENERGYWATCH SAYING I SAW 
THAT ROBERT ON WORK WOG SORT IT 
OUT WORKING LUNCH IF YOU HAVE 
DONE EVERYTHING YOU CAN DO AND THE 
COMPANY HAS MESSED IT UP BILLS 
THAT ARE LONGER THAN A YEAR OLD 
WIPE THEM OUT 
THE PHILOSOPHY IS 
THAT IF YOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHING I 
CAN AS A CONSUMER YOU HAVE PLAYED 
THE GAME PAID THE BILLS AND YOU 
HAVE SUPPLIED METRE READINGS BUT 
THE COMPANY IS IGNORING THOSE 
BECAUSE OF THEIR SYSTEMS IT 
DOESN'T FIT THEIR SYSTEMS OR WARE 
OF WORKING WHY SHOULD YOU THE 
CONSUMER FOOT THE BILL OF CHASING 
AROUND AROUND KENNETH TAYLOR HAS SAID I SEEM TO 
GET A DIFFERENT QUOTE ONLINE AS MY 
ELECTRICITY SUPPLIER THAN I GET 
FROM NPOWER DIPS IS AS MUCH AS 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY THE DIFFERENCE IS AS MUCH AS 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY HOW CAN THIS BE 
DEPENDS WHAT 
TARIFF HE IS ON WHAT CONTRACT RATE 
BEST THING FOR ANYONE WHO IS 
THINKING ABOUT SWITCHING IS TO LOOK 
AT OUR WEBSITE YOU WILLIFIED A 
LIST THERE OF ACCREDITED SWITCHING 
WILL FIND A LIST THERE THERE ARE 
ABOUT THIRTEEN SITES THEN INPUT YOUR 
DETAILS ON TO THAT SOME PEOPLE DO 
THAT BY THE AMOUNT THEY SPEND EACH 
YEAR BUT THE MOST ACCURATE WAY IS 
THE AMOUNT OF USAGE YOU HAVE GOT 
IT'S WORTH USING A DIFFERENT 
SWITCHING SITES HAVE USE A 
COUPLE AND THEY GIVE YOU DIFFERENT 
ANSWERS 
THEY SHOULDN'T IT MAY BE ANSWERS THAT THE METHODOLOGY THEY ARE USING 
ROUNDING UP OR DOWN FIGURES L. HAVE 
BEEN ON THE PHONE TO NPOWER THEY 
POINT OUT THEY ARE BRINGING UP MORE 
DEALS THEY ARE TRYING TO 
YOU SPOKE

DAVID SAYS THERE IS MUCH TALK ABOUT 
THE RISING COSTS OF GAS AND 
ELECTRICITY FOR THE DOMESTIC USER 
I HAVE JUST ORDERED DOMESTIC 
HEATING OIL WHICH HAS GONE UP FIFTY SIX PER CENT 
GIVEN THAT SINCE OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND TEN 
GIVEN THAT MANY PEOPLE IN RURAL 
AREA DON'T HAVE MAINS GAS AND 
DEPENDENT ON OIL FOR THEIR HEATING 
WHO IS LOOKING AFTER THE INTERESTS 
OF DOMESTIC OIL USERS 
THE SIMPLE 
ANSWER IS IT'S THE OFT HE NEEDS TO 
CONTACT AND EXPRESS HIS VIEWS 
OBVIOUSLY ALL OF THE ENERGY PRICES 
ARE LINKED TO OIL EITHER DIRECTLY 
OR INDIRECTLY OBVIOUSLY HEATING 
OIL IS DIRECTLY EFFECTED BUT EVEN 
GAS AND ELECTRICITY THE PRICE IS 
THERE THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE 
GENERATED SOMEHOW AND OBVIOUSLY OIL 
IS THE CASE 
SO CHECK FOR ABUSE 
WITH THE OFT WE WILL BE TALKING 
ABOUT MORTGAGE THIS IS TIME NEXT 
WEEK TIME TO GET YOUR QUESTIONS IN 
FROM ME THAT IS IT TAKE CARE 
GOODBYE 
THE TARGETS CHANGE THE TERROR DOES NOT 
THE BLOODY HISTORY OF FORTY YEARS OF TERRORISM
