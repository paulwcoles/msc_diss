THEIR NATIONWIDE NONE STOP JOURNEY 
TO FIND HIM HAS MEANT DEMANDING 
ROUND OF RADIO PRESS AND T. V. 
INTERVIEWS ON SEPTEMBER FOURTEENTH LAST 
YEAR HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT SCHOOL 
BUT ANDREW HAD OTHER PLANS 
WE JUST 
MADE AN ASSUMPTION THAT HE HAD COME 
IN FROM SCHOOL AND WAS IN HIS ROOM 
OR OUR CONVERTED CELLAR ROOM AND WE 
CALLED HIM FOR TEA AND WE REALISED 
THAT HE WASN'T IN THE HOUSE BY BY EIGHT ZERO ZERO P. M. THAT EVENING ANDREW'S STILL 
NOT HOME WE 
GOT TO THE POINT 
NOT HOME OF TRYING TO CONTACT THE SCHOOL AND 
WE WERE ABLE TO THEN FIND OUT THAT 
HE HAD NEVER EVEN TURNED UP AT 
SCHOOL IN THE MORNING 
AS THAT NEXT 
HOUR PROGRESSED WE KNEW SOMETHING 
WASN'T RIGHT AND SO WE THEN KICKED 
THINGS INTO MOTION AND PHONED THE 
POLICE POLICE THE SEARCH FOR ANDREW GOSDEN IS NOW 
A TOP PRIORITY FOR SOUTH YORKSHIRE 
POLICE 
ANDREW WAS CATEGORISED AS A POLICE VULNERABLE HIGH RISK MISSING FROM 
HOME PERSON DUE TO HIS AGE AND THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE HAS GONE 
MISSING AND THIS INCIDENT HAS BEEN 
TREATED AS A MAJOR INCIDENT ANDREW 
WENT MISSING OBVIOUSLY EARLY IN THE 
MORNING WHEN HIS PARENTS HAD 
ALREADY LEFT FOR WORK OBVIOUSLY HE 
HAS THEN RETURNED WHEN HE KNOWS 
THERE WILL BE NO ONE AT THE HOUSE 
HE HAS HAD OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE 
AND COLLECT WHATEVER ITEMS HE 
NEEDED 
HE MUST HAVE GONE TO THE NEEDED CASH TIL GOT A COUPLE OF HUNDRED 
QUID OUT AND GOT A TRAIN TO TO 
KING'S CROSS 
TWO HUNDRED WAS THE BULK OF 
ANDREW'S SAVINGS WHAT WAS HE 
PLANNING 
WE SPOKEN INITIALLY TO PLANNING THE LADY AT THE TICKET OFFICE WHO 
SOLD THE TICKET AND INTERESTINGLY 
HE BOUGHT JUST A SINGLE TICKET WHEN 
A RETURN WOULD HAVE ONLY COST FIFTY P. 
MORE WHICH POSSIBLY INDICATES HE 
WASN'T INTENDING ON COMING BACK 
HOME 
WHY HAS ANDREW TRAVELLED TO HOME LONDON OFFICERS TRAWL THROUGH 
OFFICERS OF C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE AT KING'S 
CROSS THEY EVENTUALLY FIND WHAT 
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ANDREW IS

GRANDCHILDREN DO KNOW ABOUT HIM

THE DAY AFTER HE DIDN'T RETURN TO

TO HAVE THAT CHANCE TO SEE HIS DAD 
GO TO THE PUB WITH HIS DAD GO AND 
PLAY POOL HE'S INTO SNOOKER HIS 
MATES GO WITH THEIR DADS HE WANTS

ALIVE OR IS HE TED IT'S A BIT 
DIFFICULT REALLY IT'S LIKE 
SOMETIMES CHRISTMASES I DON'T 
THINK OF IT L. GET UPSET A BIT TO TO ME THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY

PLEASE CALL MISSING PEOPLE CALLS 
ARE CONFIDENTIAL TERRI IS STILL 
WITH US AND YOU HAVE DONE WORK ON 
DEREK'S CASE WITH AGE PROGRESSION 
WITH ANY LONG TERM CASE WE CAN DO 
AN AGE PROGRESSION WHICH MEANS 
UPDATING AN IMAGE TO SHOW HOW THEY 
MIGHT LOOK TODAY 
OBVIOUSLY THERE 
IS A TIME GAP FROM WHEN DEREK WENT 
MISSING WE HAVE AN IMAGE OF WHAT 
HE LOOKED 
HE LOOKED 
LIKE AT THE TIME PERHAPS 
HE LOOKED LIKE AT THE TIME PERHAPS NOT THE CLEAREST PICTURE AND IS 
THIS WHAT YOU HAD TO WORK FROM 
YEAH WE HAD A FEW DIFFERENT IMAGES 
UNFORTUNATELY MOST WEREN'T OVERLY 
GREAT THEY'RE FAMILY SNAPSHOTS 
WHICH IS COMMON FOR WHAT WE WORK ON 
AND THAT CAN CREATES DIFFICULTIES 
WITH THE QUALITY ALSO WITH DEREK 
IT'S BEEN TWELVE OR SO YEARS ALTHOUGH 
IT SOUNDS A LONG TIME GOING FROM 
MID TWENTIES TO LATE THIRTIES AGE IS NOT THAT 
DIFFERENCE A LOT OF THE CHANGES 
ARE SUBTLE 
IT'S NOT AS DRASTIC AS 
KATRICE WE SHOWED GOING FROM A 
TODDLER WE CAN SEE THE IMAGE YOU 
HAVE CREATED NOW WITH THE 
TECHNOLOGY TALK US THROUGH THAT 
GIVEN HIM MODERN HAIRSTYLE MORE 
FACIAL LINES ADD MATURITY TO THE 
FACE WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE HAS 
GAINED WEIGHT OR DONE ANYTHING 
DIFFERENT TO AAPPEARANCE OF COURSE 
HOPEFULLY IT WILL REMIND PEOPLE 
THAT HE WON'T NECESSARILY LOOK LIKE 
THE IMAGES WE HAVE OF HIM THE 
ORIGINAL PHOTOS 
ALSO AN 
ESTIMATATION IS THERE ANYTHING 
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE 
WELL NOT MUCH 
MOST PEOPLE'S FACES DO OBVIOUSLY 
CHANGE WITH AGE THE EYEBALLS WON'T 
MOVE AND THE TEETH OBVIOUSLY WITH 
THE TEETH YOU MIGHT GET 
DISCOLOURATION AGAIN YOU DON'T 
KNOW IF THERE'S BEEN DENTAL CHANGES 
GENERALLY SPEAKING IT'S SUBTLE 
CHANGES IN THE SKIN TEXTURE

STRIKES A CHORD WITH A LOT OF 
PEOPLE I DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN 
BUT IT STRIKES A CHORD WITH ME 
WHETHER YOU DO HAVE CHILDREN THERE 
WAS JUST NO APPARENT REASON FOR 
ANDREW TO DISAPPEAR SO I FELT IT 
I WAS DOING WORK WITH SPORT RELIEF 
AND GOT INTRODUCED TO KEVIN TO THE 
FAMILY AND YEAH WE GOT TO DO 
WHATEVER WE POSSIBLY CAN TO GET 
ANDREW BACK 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
ABOUT KEVIN ABOUT WHERE YOU THOUGHT 
HE MIGHT BE IS IT THE CASE 
SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE TAKEN HIM IN 
OR WHAT IS IT 
ALL WE CAN DO IS 
SPECULATE ON WHAT MIGHT HAVE 
BOTHERED HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE OR 
WHERE HE MIGHT BE HOW HE MIGHT 
HAVE CHOSEN TO LOOK AFTER HIMSELF 
WE JUST HAVE NO IDEA IT'S SO 
WORRYING THAT YOU IMAGINE ALL THE 
WORSE SCENARIOS AND SOME OF THE 
THINGS YOU THINK OF ARE MORE 
POSITIVE AS WELL MAYBE SOMEBODY IS 
LOOKING AFTER HIM 
I KNOW IT HAS 
HAD A MASSIVE IMPACT ON THE WHOLE 
FAMILY PARTICULARLY YOU PERSONALLY 
AS WELL HASN'T IT 
I MEAN IT'S 
BEEN THE WORST TIME EVER IN MY LIFE 
CERTAINLY A WHILE BEFORE CHRISTMAS 
I GOT TO THE POINT WHERE I WAS SO 
DESPAIRING AND SO MISSING HIM THAT 
I ACTUALLY HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN 
AND TRIED TO TAKE MY OWN LIFE 
UNFORTUNATELY SPENT A NUMBER OF 
WEEKS IN HOSPITAL AS A RESULT OF 
THAT AND I AM STILL REALLY IN THE 
PROCESS OF RECOVERY FROM THAT IF IF SOMEBODY IS WATCHING WHO PERHAPS 
KNOWS ANDREW IF ANDREW IS WATCHING 
YOU HIMSELF YOU WOULD LIKE THAT 
MESSAGE YOU WOULD LIKE HIM TO KNOW 
THAT WOULDN'T YOU 
YEAH HE MUST 
KNOW THAT WE LOVE HIM THAT WE CARE 
ABOUT HIM WE ALWAYS HAVE DONE 
THAT'S HOW MUCH I MISS HIM L. WOULD 
JUST LOVE HIM I WOULD GIVE 
ANYTHING IF HE WOULD PICK UP THE 
PHONE AND CALL ME 
O. K. AND KEVIN 
YOU HAVE BEEN PROACTIVE IN THIS 
SEARCH MATT IT DOES SEEM STRIKING 
DOING THIS PROGRAMME HOW MUCH 
FAMILIES HAVE TO DO IN FACT 
THEMSELVES WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING FOR 
LOVED ONES 
YEAH I SORT OF GAVE 
MYSELF A LITTLE BIT OF OF TICKING 
OFF TOO MANY TIMESI WALKED THE 
STREET WHERE I LIVE IN WEST LONDON 
AND I AM SURE THERE ARE MILLIONS OF 
PEOPLE THE SAME JUST WALK THE 
STREET AND I WILL SEE A SIGN OR A 
PICTURE IN A WINDOW OR ON A 
LAMPPOST AND NEVER TAKE IT ON BOARD 
I WILL NEVER EVER FORGET THE FACE 
WHEN I SAW ANDREW IT JUST WON'T 
LEAVE ME L. THINK JUST TINY LITTLE 
BITS OF EFFORT LIKE THAT IF PEOPLE 
CAN MAKE THAT LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT 
THE IMAGE WILL STICK IN THEIR MIND 
AND IF YOU SEE THEM THERE ARE 
NUMBERS THAT THESE PEOPLE CAN CALL 
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THERE ARE 
CALLS COMING IN THIS MORNING SO 
BEST OF LUCK WITH ALL OF THAT 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE 
BEEN CALLS ANDREW HAS STILL NOT 
BEEN FOUND SO YOUR CALL WILL COUNT 
PLEASE IF YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS GET 
IN TOUCH WITH MISSING PEOPLE 
EARLIER WE TOLD YOU ABOUT PETER 
FOLEY HE HAS BEEN SEARCHING FOR 
THE FAMILY HE HAS NEVER MET THEN A 
LETTER ARRIVES 
PETER FOLEY FROM EDINBURGH HAS 
TRACED THE HISTORY OF HIS BIRTH 
FATHER THAT HE NEVER KNEW HE 
DECIDES TO SHARE HIS NEWS WITH HIS 
OLDEST FRIEND DOUGIE 
SAT AT THE 
TABLE AND I TOLD HIM THE STORY AT 
THE FINISH I SAID BY THE WAY MY 
FATHER'S CALLED DOCTOR ALBERT KADAKA 
AND THE CONFERS 
I JUST STOPPED 
STOPPED EATING MY WIFE STOPPED 
EATING AND LOOKED AT MY FACE AND 
SAYS DOUGIE WHAT'S WRONG THEY THEY JUST STOPPED EATING AND THE LOOKS 
ON THEIR FACES AND I THOUGHT WHAT 
HAVE I DONE HAVE I SAID SOMETHING 
WRONG HERE 
IT TOOK ME A MINUTE AND 
I WENT THAT'S MY FATHER 
THE TWO FRIENDS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN 
CLOSE LIKE BROTHERS BUT THIS 
DISCOVERY IS ALMOST TOO MUCH TO 
TAKE IN THE CONVERSATION 
WENT 
TAKE IN THE CONVERSATION THEN WENT THAT HIS FATHER WAS CALLED ALBERT 
HE WAS NIGHERIAN HE HAD AN OXFORD 
BLUE MY FATHER WAS GHANAIAN HE 
HAD BEEN AT EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY 
HE HAD GOT A BLUE FOR PLAYING 
HOCKEY THEY WERE BOTH SPORTS 
MINDED IT GOT US IN A WAY WHERE 
WE THOUGHT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
DO SOMETHING TO FIND THIS OUT ONE 
WAY OR THE OTHER BECAUSE IT WAS 
TOO MUCH AFLUKE FOR IT NOT TO BE 
SOMETHING THERE 
IT SEEMS UNLIKELY 
FOR THEIR FATHERS TO HAVE EXACTLY 
THE SAME NAME AND NOT BE THE SAME 
MAN BUT BECAUSE THERE ARE 
DIFFERENCES IN NATIONALALITY AND 
WHERE HE WENT TO UNIVERSITY PETER 
AND DOUGIE ARE STILL IN SOME DOUBT 
THEY DECIDE TO HAVE THEIR D. N. A. 
TESTED TO MAKE SURE IT ISN'T JUST 
WISHFUL THINKING 
I KNEW I SAYS TO 
MY WIFE I DON'T CARE WHAT COMES 
BACK I KNOW L. KNOW THAT PETER IS 
MY BROTHER 
THEY'VE SEEN AN ADVERT 
FOR D. N. A. TESTING BY A COMPANY BASED 
AT GLASGOW UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL 
THEY SENT A MOUTH SWAB PACK FOR 
ASALIVA SAMPLE WHICH THEY DO AND 
THEY THEN RETURN IT BY POST THE 
COMPANY RUNS THEIR TESTS AND THREE 
WEEKS LATER THE RESULTS COME 
THROUGH PETER AND DOUGIE ARE IN 
FOR A SHOCK 
THE RESULT CAME BACK 
AND IT WAS NEGATIVE WE JUST 
COULDN'T BELIEVE IT 
WHEN IT CAME 
BACK NEGATIVE I WAS DISAPPOINTED I 
WAS VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED IT IT CAUSED A BIT OF PROBLEMS AND UPSET 
BECAUSE IN OUR MINDS WE WERE 
TOTALLY CONVINCED THAT WE WERE 
HALF BROTHERS 
PETER AND DOUGIE HALF BROTHERS CALL OFF THE CELEBRATIONS THEY'VE 
PLANNED AND TRY AND PUT THEIR 
DISAPPOINTMENT BEHIND THEM BUT 
THERE IS MORE 
A MONTH OR SO LATER 
GOT A PHONE CALL FROM THIS DOCTOR 
IN GLASGOW SAYING THERE WAS GOOD 
NEWS AND THERE WAS BAD NEWS THE 
BAD NEWS WAS THEY MADE A MISTAKE 
THE GOOD NEWS IS MR. JOHNSON AND MR. 
FOLEY ARE SIBLINGS AND THAT WELL 
I STARTED TO CRY 
IT'S INCREDIBLE NEWS FOR DOUGIE 
PETER'S AWAY TAKING STOCK OF HIS 
EARLIER DISAPPOINTMENT 
IT WAS 
DOUGIE'S WIFE SAYING THAT SHE HAD 
GOT WORD FROM GLASGOW UNIVERSITY 
AND THEY MADE A TERRIBLE ERROR AND 
THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY A POSITIVE 
RESULT AND WHEN YOU SEE THE RESULTS 
NOW IT'S UNBELIEVABLY POSITIVE YOU 
CAN'T SAY IT'S IFFY IT COULDN'T BE 
ANY OTHER WAY AND WE GOT THE 
INFORMATION BACK ON MY BIRTHDAY SO 
WE HAD DOUBLE CELEBRATIONS THAT 
NIGHT 
EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT 
IT NIGHT IT MAKES THE HAIR STAND UP ON MY 
NECK BUT NOT MY HAIRS HIS HAIRS

EXTRAORDINARY NOW THAT WITH LESS 
THAN A YEAR BETWEEN THE BROTHERS NO 
ONE HAS EVER SPOTTED THE FAMILY
