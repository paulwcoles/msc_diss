TRAPPED FOR MORE THAN TWO DAYS 
THEY HAVE TO WORK INCREDIBLY 
CAREFULLY THE PEOPLE RESCUING THIS 
GOAL MAJOR SHE DID NOT GET HURT BY 
PUTTING HELMET ON HER RESCUING 
THIS GIRL MAJOR 
AROUND TWELVE KIDS HAVE BEEN SAVED FROM 
SCHOOL ALTOGETHER BUT SHE HAS LOST 
MOST OF HER FLAT CLASS MATES 
ACROSS THE DESTROYED AREA HUNDREDS 
OF KIDS STILL NEED TO BE FOUND 
SADLY MOST OF THE CHILDREN THAT 
RESCUE TEAMS ARE FINDING ARE 
ALREADY DEAD 
TODAY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SAID 
THAT ARE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE 
BURIED UNDER COLLAPSED SCHOOLS 
FACTORIES AND OTHER BUILDINGS 
AND THERE ARE ENTIRE TOWNS NEAR 
THE CENTRE OF THE EARTHQUAKE HAVE 
BEEN DESTROYED OFFICIALS SAY THERE 
ARE NO HOUSES LEFT STANDING IN THE 
AFFECTED AREA FAMILIES THAT HAVE 
SURVIVED THE QUAKE ARE HAVING TO 
LIVE AND SLEEP IN THE OPEN AIR 
THIS FARMER IS LOOKING THROUGH THE 
REMAINS OF HIS HOME FOR FOOD TO 
FEED HIS FAMILY ALL HE CAN FIND 
ARE FEW TINY GRAINS OF CORN FOR 
MOST OF THE SURVIVORS LIFE WILL BE 
A REAL STRUGGLE FOR A LONG TIME 
FINALLY WE ARE USED TO SEEING 
FLYING SAUCERS AND CREATURES FROM 
OUTER SPACE ON T. V. BUT HAVE YOU 
SEEN THEM IN REAL LIFE SOME PEOPLE 
THINK THEY HAVE THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
RELEASED SECRET FILES OF 
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS FOR THE 
FIRST TIME ARE THEY FOR REAL 
STRANGE LIGHTS IN THE SKY AT NIGHT 
FLYING SAUCERS AND LITTLE GREEN MEN 
WE USED TO SEEING THEM IN FILMS 
BUT HAS ANYONE EVER SPOTTED ALIEN 
LIFE ON EARTH 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS JUST RELEASED 
LOADS OF SECRET FILES ALL ABOUT 
U. F. O.'S SO WE MIGHT FINALLY BE 
GETTING CLOSER TO FINDING OUT WHAT 
LOTS OF PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE SEEN 
THERE ARE LETTERS AND DRAWINGS AND 
REPORTS FROM PEOPLE LIKE PILOTS AND 
POLICEMEN SAYING THEY HAVE SEEN 
STRANGE THINGS IN THE SKY ONE SAYS 
HE SPOTTED TRIANGULAR SHAPED 
CRAFT MOVING REALLY FAST WHEN 
NOTHING WAS REPORTED TO BE FLYING 
IN THE AREA IT SOUNDS PRETTY 
EXCITING BUT ALTHOUGH THE OBJECTS 
CAN'T BE EXPLAINED THEY ARE 
DEFINITELY NOT ALIENS THE FILES 
SUGGEST THAT FLYING SAUCERS AND 
U. F. O.'S ARE ACTUALLY CREATED BY 
NATURAL PHENOMENA CAUSED MAINLY BY 
ALIGHT THINGS LIKE AEROPLANE RIDES 
ODD SHAPED BALLOONS AND LIGHTNING 
IT IS A BIT DISAPPOINTING FOR 
PEOPLE WHO ARE CONVINCED THEY HAVE 
SEEN AVIAN LIFE AND SOME U. F. O. 
SPOTTERS THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS 
TRYING TO COVER UP THE TRUTH AS 
MANY STORIES WHENEVER PROPERLY 
INVESTIGATED THERE COULD STILL BE 
SOMETHING OUT THERE
