JUST AS THE OUTSIDE OF OUR HEAD CHANGES AS WE GET OLDER 
THE WAY WE HEAR SOUND CHANGES TOO 
THIS IS THE SOUND OF THE NEW YORK SUBWAY HEARD BY A YOUNG PERSON 
BUT TO AN OLDER PERSON IT WOULD INSTEAD SOUND SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
TO MAKE A SOUND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MAKE SOMETHING VIBRATE 
YOU COULD TWANG A RUBBER BAND 
OR YOU COULD BLOW DOWN SOMETHING 
OR YOU COULD BANG SOMETHING TOGETHER 
OR YOU COULD SCRAPE SOMETHING 
OR YOU COULD SHAKE SOMETHING 
THERE ARE THREE FAMILIES OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
THIS IS ONE OF THEM STRINGS 
AS YOU CAN SEE WHEN YOU PLUCK THE STRING IT VIBRATES 
THAT VIBRATION GETS PASSED ON TO THE AIR THAT'S HOW YOU HEAR THE SOUND DEEP CHORD 
HERE'S ANOTHER STRINGED INSTRUMENT FROM INDIA CALLED A GOPICHAND 
THE SECOND FAMILY WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT IS WIND INSTRUMENTS 
THESE WORK BY BLOWING INTO A TUBE AND MAKING THE AIR INSIDE VIBRATE 
YOU CAN DO THE SAME WITH A HORN 
THIS INSTRUMENT'S CALLED A BALAFON 
IT BELONGS TO THE LAST FAMILY OF INSTRUMENTS PERCUSSION 
THESE VIBRATE WHEN YOU BANG THEM 
YOU CAN DO THE SAME WITH BONGOS 
LOOK AT THIS CLOCK 
WHEN THE BELL RINGS WE CAN SEE IT AS WELL AS HEAR IT 
WE'RE CLOSE TO IT SO THE SOUND IS QUITE LOUD 
WE CAN HEAR THE SOUND THE BELL MAKES ALL THE WAY AROUND THE CLOCK 
BUT AS WE MOVE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE CLOCK 
THE SOUND OF THE ALARM GETS QUIETER 
SO HOW FAR WE ARE AWAY FROM A SOUND 
WILL AFFECT HOW LOUD IT SEEMS TO US 
I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU 
WHAT DO SOME OLD GAS PIPES A PING PONG BAT A SHOPPING TROLLEY 
AND A KITCHEN SINK HAVE IN COMMON 
THEY CAN ALL BE MADE TO MAKE MUSIC 
WHAT A RACKET I'VE IN PLYMOUTH HOME TO WEAPONS OF SOUND 
A REALLY EXCITING TEENAGE BAND 
BUT WHAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT IS THAT ALL THEIR INSTRUMENTS 
ARE MADE OUT OF RUBBISH 
WEAPONS OF SOUND HAVE BEEN GOING FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW 
AND THEY'RE DOING REALLY WELL PLAYING AT FESTIVALS AROUND BRITAIN 
AND AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
HOME TO SOME OF THE WORLD'S FINEST ORCHESTRAS 
I BET THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE ALBERT HALL 
SAW HOME MADE INSTRUMENTS LIKE THESE 
HELLO I'M JAMES I PLAY IN WEAPONS OF SOUND I PLAY THE KITCHEN SINK 
I GOT THE SINK COS MY MUM HAD A NEW ONE FITTED 
I HAD A BASH WITH THE OLD ONE 
I PLAY A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS MY MAIN INSTRUMENT IS THE DUSTBIN 
THESE ARE EVERYDAY DUSTBINS THAT YOU FIND IN YOUR BACK GARDEN 
I PLAY THE SHOPPING TROLLEY IT'S A BIT OF A BIZARRE INSTRUMENT 
BUT WE FOUND IT IN THE ROAD AND THOUGHT IT LOOKED HORRIBLE THERE 
WE BROUGHT IT TO THE BAND IT MAKES AN INTERESTING CYMBAL SOUND 
THE OIL DRUMS I PLAY ARE SHAPED SO THEY HAVE DIFFERENT SOUNDS 
THEY'RE A BIT LIKE A STEEL DRUM IN A FANCY CARNIVAL BUT CHEAPER 
THE WEAPONS OF SOUND HAVE MADE AN ART OF HITTING THINGS 
BEATING OUT RHYTHMS BUT RHYTHM ISN'T EVERYTHING 
YOU NEED INSTRUMENTS THAT'LL GIVE A DECENT 
THESE ARE MY FAVOURITE 
THEY'RE CALLED THE BAT BONES COS THEY'RE HIT WITH A BAT 
THEY'RE LONG LENGTHS OF PIPE AND THEY MAKE THIS FUNNY SOUND 
WHAT A GREAT SOUND WHERE DID YOU GET THE PIPES STEVE 
FROM THE LOCAL GAS BOARD THEY WERE GOING TO BE THROWN AWAY 
WE RECYCLE A LOT WE TAKE JUNK THAT PEOPLE WOULD NORMALLY CHUCK AWAY 
MAKE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS OUT OF IT AND BRING PLEASURE TO PEOPLE 
ARGH 
OH AH 
OH 
AH 
OH 
DOGS BARK
