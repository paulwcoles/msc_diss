WHOO 
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TREMENDOUS SUPPORT AND ENJOY THE EVENING 
THANK YOU DOCTOR RUELAND 
LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE DOCTOR 
NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE WELCOME MR. JOEY GION 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD EVENING 
SPEAKING OF ANIMALS THE BAND I HAVE WORKED UP A LITTLE SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR YOU 
SO LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED 
THE LION SLEEPS TONIGHT 
COMBINING THE TWO HELPS US CREATE NEW IDEAS 
BEN'S BEEN WORKING WITH US 
FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW 
THE REALLY IMPRESSIVE THING 
ABOUT WORKING WITH BEN 
IS THAT HE SEE THINGS IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY FROM US 
SO THE BOX HE THINKS OUTSIDE 
IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE BOX I THINK OUTSIDE 
AND HE BRINGS A REALLY REFRESHING PERSPECTIVE 
TO THE AREA WE'RE WORKING IN 
BEN'S WORKING ON THE TECHNOLOGY AREA CALLED PERVASIVE MESSAGING 
BEN'S INSIGHT INTO THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES 
MEANS THAT HE CAN USE THE TECHNOLOGY 
FOR THINGS WHICH SOLVE PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES 
THAT MOST OF US WOULDN'T KNOW EXISTED 
WE'VE GOT THIS BALL 
AND WHAT IT DOES IT'S REALLY RELAXING 
IT CHANGES COLOUR STARTS AS RED THEN SLOWLY CHANGES TO GREEN 
IT'S REALLY LOVELY 
I'VE TAKEN THIS IDEA AND THOUGHT ABOUT HOW IT CAN HELP DEAF PEOPLE 
DEAF PEOPLE HAVE PAGERS THAT VIBRATE REALLY QUITE VIOLENTLY 
TO TELL THEM SOMEONE HAS RUNG THE DOORBELL 
OR IF IT'S WAKING THEM UP IN THE MORNING IT'S REALLY INVASIVE 
HOW MUCH MORE RELAXING WOULD IT BE 
TO BE TOLD THE DOORBELL WAS RINGING BY WATCHING THE BALL CHANGE COLOUR 
I REALLY LIKE THAT IDEA 
MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS FOCUSING ON HOW I CAN IMPROVE 
AND DEVELOP MY WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH COLLEAGUES 
THAT'S MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
MY LANGUAGE IS BSL WHICH IS A NEW THING FOR I. B. M. 
THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WORKING HERE 
MANY OF WHOM LOVE LEARNING ABOUT BSL 
THIS INSPIRED ME TO THINK OF A WAY 
OF DEVELOPING BSL IN THE WORK ENVIRONMENT 
WE'VE SET UP A PROJECT THAT ENABLES US TO CREATE COMPUTER BASED SIGNING 
ALSO I GET A LOT OF SUPPORT 
THROUGH OUR OWN INTERNAL WIRELESS NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES 
WE'VE HAD THINGS SUCH AS EMAIL AND INSTANT MESSAGING FOR A WHILE 
BUT THE CREATION OF OUR SYSTEMS 
WILL ALLOW EVEN MORE CLEVER INTERACTION BETWEEN COLLEAGUES 
WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED AT I. B. M.'S RECEPTION DESK 
I WALKED IN AND I SAW ALL THESE PHOTOGRAPHS UP ON THE WALL 
AND I THOUGHT WOW WHO ARE ALL THESE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS 
AND THEN I DISCOVERED THAT THEY'RE CALLED MASTER INVENTORS 
THERE'S ONLY TWENTY OF THEM FROM THE THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE 
ONE DAY I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY PHOTO UP ON THE WALL 
THAT WOULD BE A FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT 
OUR NEXT CONTENDER HAS COME A LONG WAY IN FIVE YEARS 
BACK THEN SHE WAS SAD SINGLE AND SERIOUSLY DEPRESSED 
AS A HARD OF HEARING MUM OF TWO YOUNG CHILDREN 
SHE KNEW SHE NEEDED TO TAKE A NEW DIRECTION TO CHANGE HER LIFE 
THE AIM OF SCHOOL OF SIGN LANGUAGE 
IS TO BREAK DOWN COMMUNICATION BARRIERS 
BETWEEN DEAF PEOPLE AND THE HEARING COMMUNITY 
AND ALSO RAISE THE AWARENESS OF DEAF PEOPLE AND THEIR LANGUAGE 
I'M HARD OF HEARING AND I HAVE BEEN SINCE THE AGE OF FIVE 
AND I COULDN'T ACCEPT BEING DEAF 
I DIDN'T WANT TO DIFFERENT I DIDN'T WANT TO WEAR HEARING AIDS 
IN AUDIOLOGY THEY'D SAY TO MY MUM 
WE CAN'T GET AN ACCURATE READING FROM DEBRA'S RESULTS 
AND THAT WAS BECAUSE I USED TO PRETEND I COULD HEAR 
I'D WATCH HER FINGER MOVING AND I'D THINK SHE'S PRESSING SOMETHING 
I MUST BE ABLE TO HEAR SOMETHING 
SO I JUST FOBBED MY WAY THROUGH LIFE REALLY 
I STILL WILL NEVER EVER TELL PEOPLE WHEN I MEET THEM 
THAT I'M HARD OF HEARING 
BECAUSE USUALLY THEY START TALKING TO YOU LIKE YOU'RE A BIT STUPID 
YOU KNOW SO I TEND NOT TO TELL THEM 
I WAS BRINGING UP TWO CHILDREN ON MY OWN AGED TWO AND THREE 
AND THINGS WERE REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT 
AND I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT CAREER TO TAKE 
AND THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED TO GO TO A LOCAL DEAF CHARITY 
AND ENROL THERE AND THAT'S WHERE I STARTED LEARNING SIGN LANGUAGE 
AND I MET OTHER PEOPLE FROM THE DEAF COMMUNITY AND IT OPENED MY EYES 
I HAD A WHOLE NEW WORLD THAT I HADN'T KNOWN EXISTED BEFORE THEN 
AND WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF THE DEAF COMMUNITY 
I REALISED WHAT DISCRIMINATION THERE REALLY IS OUT THERE 
AND HOW THEY ARE LABELLED 
AND HOW TO ACCESS SIMPLE THINGS IS JUST SO VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM 
WE ARE FROM THE SCHOOL OF SIGN LANGUAGE AND THIS IS BEVERLEY 
BEVERLEY IS PROFOUNDLY DEAF SO SHE'S GOING TO BE USING SIGN LANGUAGE 
AND I'M GOING TO INTERPRET FOR YOU SO I'M GOING TO VOICE OVER 
IF ANYBODY CAN'T HEAR ME PLEASE JUST SHOUT 
AND I'LL RAISE MY VOICE A LITTLE BIT LOUDER FOR YOU O. K. 
THE GOVERNMENT ARE CLOSING ALL THE DEAF SCHOOLS DOWN 
IT MEANS THAT DEAF CHILDREN WILL BE GOING INTO MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS 
AND THE TEACHERS OR THE CHILDREN AREN'T DEAF AWARE 
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BASIC CONCEPTION 
OF HOW TO GET A DEAF PERSON'S ATTENTION 
AND THAT'S WHEN I THOUGHT O. K. I THINK I CAN DO SOMETHING HERE 
I THINK I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
TO DEAF PEOPLE AND TO THE HEARING COMMUNITY 
BARRIER ISN'T A WORD 
IN DEBBIE'S VOCABULARY 
I WONDER IF SHE EVEN SIGNS IT 
BECAUSE NOTHING SHE SEES LIFE AS AN OPPORTUNITY 
SHE SEES SOLUTIONS NOT BARRIERS 
AND THAT IS SOMETHING ABOUT HER POSITIVITY 
WE VISIT SCHOOLS ON A REGULAR BASIS JUST TO PROMOTE THE LANGUAGE 
AND WE DELIVER FREE TASTER SESSIONS INITIALLY 
IN THE AIM THAT HOPEFULLY THEY WILL SET UP A WORKSHOP IN THE FUTURE 
SO THAT CHILDREN CAN LEARN BASIC SIGN LANGUAGE 
I THINK IT'S GOOD BECAUSE IN CLASSES SOMETIMES THERE'S DEAF PEOPLE 
AND YOU HAVE TO WORK AS GROUPS 
AND IT'S EASIER TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM 
I LEARNT HOW MANY DEAF PEOPLE THERE ARE IN BRITAIN 
AND HOW MANY INTERPRETERS THERE ARE 
AND IT JUST SHOWS THAT DEAF PEOPLE HAVE TO STRUGGLE 
BECAUSE THERE AREN'T MANY INTERPRETERS 
I FELT THAT IF WE WENT IN AND DELIVERED THESE WORKSHOPS 
COURSES TO THE CHILDREN AND TO THE TEACHERS 
THEN IF A DEAF PERSON COME IN THEY'D BE WELCOMED WITH OPEN ARMS 
BECAUSE ALL THESE CHILDREN WOULD YOU KNOW RUSH TO COMMUNICATE 
WITH THIS PERSON WITHOUT A DOUBT 
BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO SIGN AND KIDS LOVE SIGNING 
THE FIRST OFFICIAL DAY OF SCHOOL OF SIGN LANGUAGE TRADING 
WE'D BEEN INVITED TO A SCHOOL 
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DO 
AND THE HEAD TEACHER WAS REALLY QUITE RUDE 
AND SAID WHAT DO YOU WANT AND WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT 
AND WE WERE A BIT DEFLATED THINKING GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME 
DISABLED ENTREPRENEURS REALLY HAVE TO WORK MUCH HARDER FIGHT HARDER 
FOR GETTING FINANCE IN PLACE THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE OF THEM 
AND ALSO I WOULD SAY THAT BEYOND GETTING MONEY IN PLACE 
WHICH IS JUST ONE ELEMENT 
IT'S TRYING TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE SEE THE REAL NEED FOR THE BUSINESS 
A TYPICAL DAY HERE AT THE SCHOOL OF SIGN LANGUAGE 
IS TO FACILITATE THE TASTER SESSIONS IN THE SCHOOLS 
AND ALSO TO ORGANISE DEAF AWARENESS TRAINING 
WITHIN COMPANIES AND COMMUNITY GROUPS 
SO BASICALLY IT'S JUST FACILITATING EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON HERE 
WE ALSO HAVE THE INTERPRETING SERVICE AS WELL 
SO WE'RE TAKING BOOKING ON A DAILY BASIS AS WELL 
PEOPLE WERE APPROACHING US FROM EVERYWHERE REALLY AND ALL AGES 
NATASHA IS ELEVEN YEARS OLD AND SHE'S FROM MANCHESTER 
HER MUM CONTACTED ME A FEW WEEKS AGO 
SAYING THAT NATASHA HAD PASSED HER LEVEL ONE 
AND THAT SHE WANTED TO DO LEVEL TWO 
I EXPLAINED TO TRACEY NATASHA'S MUM 
THAT LEVEL TWO WAS PROBABLY TOO IN DEPTH 
AND TOO MUCH PRESSURE FOR A GIRL HER AGE BECAUSE BSL LEVEL TWO IS FLUENT 
SO I INVITED HER TO THE OFFICE 
TO HAVE AN ASSESSMENT WITH ONE OF OUR TUTORS 
AFTER THAT ASSESSMENT THE TUTOR OBVIOUSLY GAVE ME FEEDBACK 
AND SAID THE LITTLE GIRL IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
SHE SIGNS REALLY REALLY WELL 
HER SKILLS ARE THE SAME AS THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP 
SO SHE'S JOINED THE LEVEL TWO 
AND SHE'S LOVING IT AND SHE OUTSHINES HER PEERS 
I LIKE DOING SIGN LANGUAGE 
BECAUSE I CAN STILL COMMUNICATE WITH MY FRIENDS 
SO THEY'VE NOT JUST GOT TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER 
THEY'VE GOT OTHER FRIENDS AS WELL AS THEIR DEAF FRIENDS 
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE I WOULD BE REALLY SURPRISED 
IF DEBBIE IN FIVE YEARS' TIME HASN'T GOT A NATIONAL FRANCHISE 
OF SCHOOL OF SIGN LANGUAGE ALL OVER THE U. K. 
AND BEYOND THAT 
GIVEN HER INTEREST IN MAKING THIS REALLY AN ACCESSIBLE LANGUAGE 
AND FUN 
OOH YOU'RE LIKE A COOK ALREADY AREN'T YOU 
THEY PUT IT IN COLD WATER TO SEPARATE IT DON'T THEY 
WHAT ABOUT YOU HAVE YOU HAD A GOOD DAY YEAH 
MY CHILDREN ARE VERY PROUD AT THE BEGINNING TWO YEARS AGO 
WHEN I SET UP THE COMPANY I WAS WORKING REALLY REALLY HARD 
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AND I WAS WORKING FROM HOME 
SO I WAS EASILY DISTRACTED FROM MY FAMILY LIFE DRAWN BACK INTO WORK 
BUT I'D TO SAY PLEASE GIRLS JUST LET ME WRITE THIS ONE MORE LETTER 
OBVIOUSLY BRINGING THEM UP ON MY OWN IT WAS DIFFICULT 
BUT NATASHA SHE TELLS ALL HER FRIENDS 
THAT I'M THE QUEEN OF SIGN LANGUAGE 
THE MESSAGE THAT WE WANT TO GET ACROSS TO CHILDREN 
IS TO MAKE THEM THINK ABOUT THE MASSIVE SHORTAGE OF INTERPRETERS 
IN THE U. K. SO HOPEFULLY IT MIGHT PUT A LITTLE IDEA INTO THEIR HEAD 
THAT MAYBE WHEN THEY FINISH SCHOOL 
THAT THEY MAY GO ON LEARN SIGN LANGUAGE 
AND MAYBE THINK ABOUT BECOMING A INTERPRETER 
BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT RAISING THE AWARENESS 
OF THE LABEL THAT DEAF PEOPLE ARE USUALLY LABELLED WITH 
WHICH IS DEAF AND DUMB 
WE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON GETTING RID OF THE LABEL 
NOBODY LIKES TO BE LABELLED 
SO THAT'S THE AIM REALLY 
IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT TO SET UP A BUSINESS MAYBE 
THEN I WOULD SAY GO FOR IT 
ONE BIT OF ADVICE I WOULD GIVE TO ANYBODY THAT I MEET 
IS ALWAYS GIVE MORE THAN WHAT'S EXPECTED 
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS DRAMA SCHOOLS IN THE WORLD 
RESPONSIBLE FOR GIVING US WORLD FAMOUS ACTORS 
AND NOW RADA HAS THE FIRST EVER DEAF STUDENT 
WHO IS POISED TO GRADUATE AND STEP OUT FROM THE WINGS 
I THINK BEING THE FIRST DEAF PERSON AT RADA 
COMES WITH A MASSIVE RESPONSIBILITY 
IT COMES WITH THE PRESSURE 
OF CONTINUOUSLY PROVING YOURSELF AS AN ACTOR 
BUT MORE SO AS A DEAF PERSON 
ACHIEVING NEW HEIGHTS BREAKING NEW GROUND 
I SUPPOSE THERE IS A RISK INVOLVED 
FOR RADA 
IN TAKING A STUDENT LIKE SOPHIE ON 
BECAUSE SHE WAS THE FIRST 
WE DIDN'T KNOW QUITE HOW TO MANAGE IT 
WHAT CLASSES SHE WOULD REQUIRE AN INTERPRETER A SIGNER 
HOW SHE WOULD FARE ON THE BIG STAGE 
AND ALSO WHAT AGENTS AND CASTING DIRECTORS WOULD MAKE OF HER 
IN FACT THE ADVANTAGES THAT WE GAINED 
ABOUT OURSELVES OUR TEACHING METHODS 
QUITE APART FROM HOW TO DEAL WITH SOMEBODY WITH HEARING IMPAIRMENT 
WERE AMAZING 
AND I THINK FAR OUTSTRIPPED THE POTENTIAL DISADVANTAGES 
I HAD BEEN A MUM FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS 
BEFORE I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO GO TO DRAMA SCHOOL 
AND MY MOTHER SUGGESTED WHY DON'T YOU TRY RADA 
I HADN'T HEARD OF RADA BEFORE 
SO I HADN'T HAD ANY IDEA JUST HOW PRESTIGIOUS HOW BIG IT WAS 
AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN I LOOKED ON THE WALL 
AND I SAW ALL OF THESE AMAZING NAMES 
THAT IT SANK IN JUST WHAT I'D LET MYSELF IN FOR 
WHEN I GOT TO THE THIRD ROUND THE TUTORS THERE HAD TOLD ME 
ABOUT HOW IT WOULD BE MORE BENEFICIAL FOR ME IF I WENT OUT 
AND JOINED DRAMA GROUPS READ NEW PLAYS WENT TO SEE NEW PLAYS 
AND GOT BACK INVOLVED IN THE DRAMA WORLD 
AND THEN TRIED AGAIN NEXT YEAR 
HAVING APPLIED FOR OTHER PLACES TO GET USED TO THE AUDITION PROCESS 
SO I DID ALL OF THAT 
AND I REALLY ENJOYED THAT PROCESS 
AND I REALLY FELT I WAS THROWING MYSELF BACK INTO THE WORLD I LOVE 
THEN WHEN I TRIED FOR THE SECOND TIME 
I GOT ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND THEY ACCEPTED ME 
PEOPLE DID SAY YOU KNOW DID YOU GET IN 
BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
MAYBE THEY'VE TAKEN YOU IN BECAUSE YOU'RE DEAF 
AND THAT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME TO GET RID OF 
AND NOW I KNOW I CAN TRUST 
THAT RADA DON'T TAKE ON PEOPLE JUST FOR THEIR ABILITY 
REGARDLESS OF THEIR DISABILITY YOU HAVE TO BE GOOD FULL STOP 
ESPECIALLY IN THE TECHNICAL REHEARSAL 
I TRY TO JUST GET ON WITH THE JOB IN HAND 
BUT IF THERE ARE DIRECTIONS BEING SHOUTED OUT FROM THE AUDITORIUM 
THEN I AM ABLE TO LOOK AT THE COMMUNICATOR 
WHO WILL TEND TO TELL ME GO TO THE LEFT OR START AGAIN 
I SUSPECT THE PITFALLS OF BEING A DEAF ACTRESS 
OR AN ACTRESS WITH SEVERE HEARING PROBLEMS IS VOCAL CLARITY 
I THINK THE WAY SOPHIE IMPROVED 
SHE TOOK ON HER VOICE CLASSES AND HER TEXT CLASSES 
AND GOT CLEARER AND CLEARER ON STAGE 
NEVERTHELESS THAT IS A PROBLEM IT HAS TO BE SAID 
I THINK SHE CAN SURMOUNT IT 
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I HAD SPEECH THERAPY VIA HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS 
BUT THEIR SPEECH THERAPY WAS MORE ABOUT RECOGNISING DIFFERENT SOUNDS 
WITH VOICE TRAINING HERE AT RADA 
THE WAY THAT THEY MAKE YOU ANALYSE 
WHAT IS HAPPENING INSIDE OF YOUR MOUTH 
HAS AMAZING AMAZING RESULTS 
AND THEY CAN COMPLETELY CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOU SPEAK 
AND I THINK IF MORE DEAF PEOPLE HAD THAT LEVEL OF TRAINING 
THEY'D BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE SO MUCH MORE 
I PERSONALLY CAN'T JUDGE HOW MUCH I'VE IMPROVED 
BUT PEOPLE SAY THAT I'VE COME SO FAR 
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED I WAS THE SAME PERSON 
I DO FIND MYSELF WORKING TEN TIMES HARDER THAN SOME OTHER PEOPLE 
I MEAN EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN DISABILITIES AS SUCH 
YOU KNOW THINGS THAT THEY HAVE TO WORK HARDER AT 
LIKE DYSLEXIA OR YOU KNOW BEING PATIENT 
ANYTHING THAT HINDERS THEM FROM PROGRESSING 
I THINK THE FUTURE FOR SOPHIE IS ANYTHING 
I THINK SHE'S WONDERFUL ON STAGE 
I KNOW THAT SHE'S VERY VERY GOOD ON TELLY AND FILM 
BECAUSE THAT REQUIRES LESS VOICE IF YOU WANT 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT SHE HAS GOT THE SAME POSSIBILITIES 
AS ANY ACTRESS 
EVERYBODY HAS A CERTAIN EXPECTATION OF HOW FAR A DEAF PERSON COULD GO 
AND IT'S UP TO YOU TO KEEP EXCEEDING THOSE EXPECTATIONS 
MY HOPE FOR THE FUTURE 
IS TO BREAK INTO MAINSTREAM THEATRE AND MEDIA 
TO ACHIEVE THE TITLE OF ACTOR 
WITHOUT THE DEAF STIGMA ATTACHED TO IT 
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH BEING ASHAMED OF BEING DEAF 
I'VE LEARNT NOW TO EMBRACE MY DEAFNESS 
BUT IT'S ABOUT NOT BEING SEEN ON THE STAGE 
AS SOMEBODY WHO CAN ACHIEVE GREAT THINGS 
BUT THEY'RE DEAF YOU KNOW WOW AND I DON'T WANT THAT 
SO GOING ON STAGE JUST ACTING JUST DOING WHAT I LOVE 
AND THEN COMING OFF AND PEOPLE SAYING OH MY GOD YOU'RE DEAF 
I DIDN'T REALISE THAT IS A GREAT SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT 
THAT'S IT FOR THIS WEEK'S PROGRAMME 
IF YOU MISSED ANYTHING YOU CAN WATCH IT FOR THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS 
WITH SUBTITLES ON THE B. B. C. IPLAYER 
WHY NOT CHECK OUT OUR SEE HEAR WEBSITE FOR ALL THE LATEST NEWS 
GOODBYE 
AND MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO BARRIERS WITHIN EMPLOYMENT 
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THAT'S MY PASSION 
I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHERS THINGS WE STILL NEED TO DO 
JUST EVERY DAY PEOPLE GOING TO THE SHOPS TO THE DOCTORS 
PEOPLE WANTING TO TRAVEL 
AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE PUSHING THOSE BOUNDARIES
