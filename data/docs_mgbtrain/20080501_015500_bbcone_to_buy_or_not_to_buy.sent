NO COS WHEN WE STOPPED AT THE PETROL STATION AND ASKED THAT MAN 
HE SAID GO ROUND THE WREKIN AND THIS IS THE WREKIN 
YES JENNY BUT WE'RE IN THE MIDLANDS AND IT'S AN EXPRESSION 
SO HE MEANT GO THE LONG WAY ROUND NOT BRING ME TO THE WREKIN 
OH WELL WELCOME TO TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY COME ON 
RIGHT SHALL I EXPLAIN YEAH 
O. K. THIS HILL HERE OOH IS FOUR HUNDRED METRES HIGH O. K. 
DOMINATES THE VIEWS IN SHROPSHIRE WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND IT'S WHERE THE PHRASE COMES FROM 
IT MEANS GO THE LONG WAY ROUND HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT 
I CAN'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERY PLACE WE GO TO ROUND THE COUNTRY CAN I WHY NOT IT'S YOUR JOB 
IAN BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS FIND THREE LOVELY PROPERTIES FOR OUR BUYERS 
AND THEN GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO 
OH YEAH TRY BEFORE THEY BUY 
EXACTLY SO MEET GREG AND JULIE PYNCHON AND THEIR PUPPY DAISY 
THEY'RE NO STRANGERS TO THE PRESSURES OF THE PROPERTY MARKET 
HAVING MOVED HOUSE TWENTY FIVE TIMES IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHILST GREG WAS IN THE AIR FORCE OOH 
AFTER A FEW YEARS IN THEIR PRESENT PLACE THEY'VE DECIDED THE NEXT MOVE WILL BE THEIR LAST 
AND WHO COULD BLAME THEM BUT FOR THAT REASON IT HAS TO BE THE PERFECT HOME 
THEY'LL NEED ROOM FOR VISITORS AS THEY REGULARLY SEE THEIR THREE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILD BAILEY 
THEY BOTH LOVE THE SHROPSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE AND ENJOY WALKING DAISY THROUGH OPEN FIELDS 
SO THEY WANT TO STAY LOYAL TO THE COUNTY AND FIND SOMETHING THERE 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A HOME FINALLY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO STAY IN SO JUST EXPLAIN WHY I SAY A HOME FINALLY 
A FINAL RESTING PLACE I WOULD CALL IT OH DON'T SAY THAT 
IN FIVE OR SIX YEARS WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET TO THE RETIREMENT BIT 
SO WE SAID RIGHT WHEN WE GET TO THAT AGE 
ARE WE GOING TO BE FIT AND HEALTHY ENOUGH TO MOVE I DON'T KNOW 
LET'S CHOP THE TOP OF THE HOUSE OFF 
MOVE INTO SOMETHING LIKE A BUNGALOW OR SOME SMALLISH TYPE PLACE 
NOT NECESSARILY SMALL AS IN AREA DOWNSTAIRS AREA BUT TAKE THE TOP OFF 
ARE WE LOOKING AT SHROPSHIRE OR AT SOMETHING MORE SPECIFIC 
SHROPSHIRE I WOULD SAY REALLY 
IT'S QUITE A BIG SHIRE ISN'T IT 
IT'S QUITE A BIG SHIRE YEAH SHIRE 
IT'S A LOVELY COUNTY ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL COUNTY 
IN THE AIR FORCE WE'VE TRAVELLED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
AND LARGE PARTS OF THE WORLD AS WELL 
AND THOUGH THERE ARE SOME BEAUTIFUL PARTS SHROPSHIRE SUITS US 
SO WE'RE DOWNSIZING SO PRESUMABLY FEWER BEDROOMS YEAH TWO BEDROOMS WOULD BE IDEAL 
LESS BEDROOMS BUT THE SAME AREA IF POSSIBLE YEAH DOWNSTAIRS 
WE'VE GOT OUR FIRST GRANDCHILD HOPEFULLY THERE'LL BE MORE SO WHEN WE'RE ALL THERE 
IT'S QUITE A BUSY HOUSEHOLD O. K. YOU NEED ROOM TO HAVE THEM TO VISIT 
AND THE DOGS OF COURSE WE'VE ONLY ONE NOW 
WHAT DOGS WE'VE GOT DAISY WHO'S A FOUR YEAR OLD SPRINGER SPANIEL 
AND MY DAUGHTER'S GOT THREE WORKING COCKER SPANIELS AND MY SON'S GOT A BOXER SLASH STAFFY CROSS OH BOY 
SO OF COURSE WHEN THE FAMILY VISIT THAT INCLUDES THE DOGS RIGHT 
A BIG FAMILY AND THEY'RE ANIMAL LOVERS DOES THAT MEAN BIG GARDEN 
NOT ESPECIALLY NO NO BUT SOME GARDEN SOMETHING YEAH 
FOR THE DOGS AND BAILEY OF COURSE TO KICK HIS FOOTBALL IN 
WHAT ABOUT THE CAR ARE YOU BOTHERED ABOUT OFF ROAD PARKING GARAGES 
A GARAGE IS NOT ESSENTIAL IF THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM WE CAN BUILD ONE 
SO YOU'RE HAPPY TO DO SOME HOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM EXTENSIONS AND 
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM IS IT TO A DEGREE WE'RE NOT BIG HEAVY CONSTRUCTION EXPERTS 
BUT WE DON'T MIND KNOCKING THE ODD THING UP 
YOU'VE GOT HIM IN A TIGHT JUMPER TODAY 
WOO YOU BEEN WORKING OUT GREG ONE THING WE HAVEN'T TALKED OUT 
AHEM BUDGET BUDGET 
HOW MUCH HAVE WE GOT TO SPEND ON YOUR FINAL RESTING PLACE AS YOU PUT IT 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT YOU CAN'T SAY THAT NOT YET 
TOP WHACK WOULD BE TWO HUNDRED TEN WOULDN'T IT O. K. TWO HUNDRED TEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
OH IT'S USUALLY THE OTHER WAY ROUND ISN'T IT 
TWO HUNDRED TEN YOU ALWAYS GO OVER THE TOP ANYWAY I KNOW I DO 
RIGHT SO TWO HUNDRED TEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN IF WE'RE TALKING TO GREG 
YEAH BRILLIANT O. K. GOOD RIGHT 
WELL YOU REST YOUR LAURELS THERE 
O. K. AND WE'LL POP OUT AND GO AND FIND AN IDEAL HOME HA HA 
WE'LL HAVE A COFFEE WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT YEAH MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME 
WE'RE NOT OVER THE TOP ARE WE 
NO WE'RE NOT OVER THE TOP 
HE DIDN'T MEAN THAT DID HE NO 
BUDGET WISE YEAH BUDGET WISE 
JUST FOR SAYING THAT I MIGHT GO OVER THE TOP HE SAID TWO HUNDRED TEN P. F. F. MAYBE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THEN 
MAYBE A BIT HIGHER COS WE NEVER GO OVER ACTUALLY 
NO TODAY MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THOUGH 
INDEED YEAH SO WHAT ABOUT THIS THING ABOUT CUT THE TOP OFF 
I THINK WHAT HE MEANT WAS HE WANTS A BUNGALOW O. K. ALL RIGHT O. K. 
SO A COUPLE OF BEDROOMS THEY WANT TO DOWNSIZE ON THE BEDROOMS BUT LOTS OF SPACE DOWNSTAIRS 
BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A BIG FAMILY LOTS OF DOGS 
SAME SQUARE FOOTAGE IS WHAT I THINK WE SAY AND RURAL 
NO MAIN ROAD BIT OF A GARDEN 
THE GRANDCHILDREN YEAH O. K. WE'VE GOT IT ALL REALLY HAVEN'T WE 
YEP AND AS THEY MENTIONED SHROPSHIRE'S ONE OF THE PRETTIEST COUNTIES IN THE COUNTRY 
USUALLY YOU'RE OFF SWANNING AROUND WHILE I GO AND DO ALL THE ADMIN LET'S SWAP 
TODAY I'M GOING TO GO OUT AND MEET THE LOVELY FOLK AND YOU DO THE ADMIN I'LL SEE YOU LATER O. K. 
WHAT HE DOESN'T REALISE IS IT'S FREEZING COLD WHICH MEANS I GET TO GO TO AN ESTATE AGENT'S 
GET A COFFEE AND MAYBE THEY'LL BE CAKE 
THAT WOMAN IS ALWAYS AFTER CAKE 
THE COUNTY OF SHROPSHIRE LIES ON THE BORDER OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
AND IS SET AGAINST A BACKDROP OF PATCHWORK FIELDS ROLLING HILLS WOODED VALLEYS AND RACING RIVERS 
ITS COUNTY TOWN SHREWSBURY IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF CHARLES DARWIN WHO WAS BORN IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINE 
MEDIEVAL COBBLED STREETS AND THE MAGNIFICENT ABBEY CHURCH REMAIN 
PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS SHROPSHIRE TOWN IS IRONBRIDGE 
IN THE BEAUTIFUL SEVEN VALLEY IT WAS THE U. K.'S 
FIRST WORLD HERITAGE SITE IN CELEBRATION OF ITS FASCINATING INDUSTRIAL HISTORY 
PROPERTY WISE SHROPSHIRE IS STILL SLIGHTLY UNDER THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AS CURRENT PRICES GO 
BUT WHAT YOU MAY ASK CAN YOU GET FOR TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND IN OTHER U. K. COUNTIES 
IN STAFFORDSHIRE YOU COULD BUY THIS THREE BEDROOMED EDWARDIAN TOWN HOUSE

ORIGINAL FEATURES HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED AND ENHANCED 
AND THERE ARE WELL ORGANISED FRONT AND BACK GARDENS 
NOT FORGETTING A DETACHED GARAGE YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL FOR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY

THE PROPERTY FACES THE SEA FRONT AND HAS A SMALL COURTYARD GARDEN AT THE BACK 
INSIDE IT'S NEAT AND MODERN AND IS A PERFECT HOME FOR ANYONE WANTING TO RELOCATE TO THE SEASIDE 
IT COSTS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
BUT IF NEITHER OF THOSE TAKES YOUR FANCY WHAT ABOUT A FOUR BEDROOMED 
VICTORIAN SEMI DETACHED HOME IN GREATER MANCHESTER 
IT'S A BEAUTIFULLY REFURBISHED PLACE IN THE TOWN OF BURY IN THE NORTH OF THE COUNTY 
ALL THE FEATURES IN A WELL CARED FOR HOME

BUT QUITE OFTEN WE OFFER UP A WILD CARD AND PEOPLE SAY 
DO YOU KNOW NOW YOU'VE OFFERED IT TO US IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA YOU'VE OPENED OUR MINDS 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO WITH THIS PROPERTY IT'S MORE A CHANGE OF LIFESTYLE

IT'S SOMEBODY WHO'S RECENTLY DEVELOPED THIS PLACE SO IT'S NOT QUITE FINISHED 
FINISHING TOUCHES BEING DONE TO IT I'M JUST LOOKING AROUND YOU'RE RIGHT 
THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY PUT A LOT OF WORK INTO IT 
HEY WHAT'S THIS THEN IS THIS A KITCHEN 
A UTILITY PERHAPS IS IT A UTILITY A KITCHEN 
WAS IT A. GOOD STANDARD CUPBOARDS 
IT CAN'T BE A KITCHEN 
IT MIGHT BE A UTILITY BUT THERE'S NO PROVISION FOR ANY COOKER OR ANYTHING IS THERE SO 
WHAT A GREAT UTILITY ROOM DOWN THERE YOU SEE GREG'S A SPORTSMAN 
KEEP ALL HIS STUFF DOWN THERE KEEP THE GRANDCHILDREN'S WELLIES 
KEEP THE DOG'S BOWL KEEP THE DOG THERE 
O. K. UPSTAIRS THEN 
I THINK IT'S UPSTAIRS 
THIS STARTED OFF A BIT ODD SO IT MIGHT NOT BE UPSTAIRS 
OH LOOK AT THAT AH M. M.

THAT'S DIFFERENT 
I PRESUME THIS MUST BE THE LIVING AREA THIS MUST BE THE LIVING ROOM 
WOW LOOK AT THAT OH YEAH

WELL IT CERTAINLY IS A WOW MOMENT 
OH THINK THAT'S A REAL WOW OR IS SHE JUST BEING NICE TO US 
I THINK SHE'S BEING NICE TO US 
IT'S NICE ISN'T IT CERTAINLY IS 
A FLAT I THINK ISN'T IT 
I THINK IT'S WHAT OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS CALL A DUPLEX APARTMENT 
NOW THEN YOU SEE THAT'S QUITE A NICE BIG KITCHEN 
OOH LOOK AT THAT 
THIS HAS OBVIOUSLY VERY RECENTLY BEEN DONE UP HASN'T IT 
SO THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DO FOR ONE THING 
NO LOOK AT THAT 
IS THAT A SKYLIGHT OF SOME DESCRIPTION 
I WONDER WHAT THIS WAS BEFORE THEN I WONDER 
WHETHER IT WAS ACCOMMODATION OR THEY'VE CONVERTED IT SOME SORT OF STORAGE 
BUT IT LOOKS GOOD THERE'S NOTHING TO DO IF YOU WANTED TO 
LOOK AT THOSE LIGHTS IT'D SUIT WHAT WE WANTED 
AND THERE'S SHROPSHIRE LOVELY 
GREAT VIEWS AND THAT'S WHAT THEY GET BY BEING UP A LEVEL 
THIS IS LOVELY IT'S LIKE A GALLERY LANDING ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
SO THIS PRESUMABLY IS A LIVING AREA AND I PRESUME THAT MUST BE A. 
T. V. POINT THERE IS IT 
HARDWOOD WINDOWS AS WELL YEAH 
THEY'RE NEARLY MAINTENANCE FREE I JUST HAVE TO STAIN THEM EVERY SO OFTEN 
SOMEBODY'S PUT A LOT OF WORK INTO THIS THEY HAVE PROBABLY A LOT OF MONEY I LIKE THIS

RIGHT WHAT'S IN HERE 
O. K. WHERE ARE WE OH BATHROOM 
OH LOOK AT THAT 
AND THAT'S ONE OF THEM CORNER BATH THINGS ISN'T IT 
THE REASON THAT CORNER BATH'S THERE IS IT'S NOT WIDE ENOUGH 
TO PUT A FULL LENGTH BATH IN IT BUT THEY'VE DONE A NICE JOB MADE USE OF THE SPACE 
MADE USE OF THE SPACE IN THE BEST WAY 
OH AND A SHOWER AS WELL 
NOW THEN FLOORING 
TILED IT'S PLASTICKY TILES INNIT

STRAIGHT UP THE WALLS IT'S NOT A VERY BIG BATHROOM BUT IT'S BIG ENOUGH 
VERY MODERN CERAMIC TILES DOWNLIGHTERS IN HERE 
IT'S ALL VERY CONTEMPORARY 
O. K. WHAT'S IN HERE THEN 
BEDROOM YEAH 
M. M. M. NICE SIZED BEDROOM 
FAIR OLD SIZE FUNNY OLD SHAPE INNIT 
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT QUIRKY THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME THINK THIS WASN'T ACCOMMODATION 
THIS WAS SOMETHING ELSE NO NO 
SO THIS BEDROOM'S QUIRKY 
LISTEN IF IT ISN'T QUIRKY THEY COULD MAKE IT QUIRKY YEAH 
VIEW OF THE HIGH STREET YEAH BROSELEY 
SHROPSHIRE 
IT'S ALL ABOUT YOUR POSITION HERE OH I'D LOVE IT YEAH 
YOU WOULD BECAUSE THE COUNTRYSIDE ALL AROUND US HOWEVER IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT

WHAT'S THAT THEN 
ANYBODY IN THERE ALL RIGHT 
GREG NOPE NO GHOSTIES AND GHOULIES IN THERE 
THAT MUST BE INTO THE LOFT 
IT IS INTO THE LOFT A SEPARATE PART OF THE LOFT THAN THERE 
SO YES YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS INTO THE LOFT 
IT'S SPLIT LEVEL A BIT SHARED WITH THE NEXT BUILDING STORAGE IN THERE 
THIS IS ANOTHER ODD SHAPED THING IN FACT THE WHOLE BUILDING IT'S OBVIOUS NOW 
IT'S THE CORNER OF THE STREET IT'S QUIRKY 
I THINK IT'S QUITE NICE YEAH 
THIS IS CURIOUS YOU KNOW YEAH 
IT SUITS THEM IT SUITS THEIR NEEDS 
YEAH THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING OH 
SO GREG AND JULIE YOU'LL ALWAYS FIND JENNY AND ME AT THE KITCHEN AT PARTIES 
YEAH COS NOBODY ELSE TALKS TO US WE HAVE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER 
THE QUESTION IS IS IT GOOD OR HAVE YOU GOT A SINKING FEELING OH VERY GOOD IAN 
SO JULIE TELL US IT WAS THE WILD CARD 
WHAT DID IT MAKE YOU THINK 
I THINK IT'S VERY NICE 
THE SPACE IS VERY QUIRKY ISN'T IT 
M. M. M. VERY DIFFERENT 
VERY NICE I'VE A FEW IDEAS UP HERE 
YEAH YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE GOT A FEW THINGS ON YOUR MIND THERE 
I LIKE IT 
I LIKE I LIKE I LIKE THE WILD CARD IDEA YEAH 
UM I CAN'T SEE ANYWHERE FOR LITTLE DAISY TO GO 
THE DOUBLE DEPTH GARAGE AND THAT BIG UTILITY ROOM DOWNSTAIRS 
AND TO BE HONEST THAT IS YOUR KIND OF ONLY EXTRA SPACE 
THERE ISN'T A GARDEN HERE AS SUCH WHICH YOU'VE NOTICED YEAH 
THOUGH WE'RE SURROUNDED BY COUNTRYSIDE SO I SEE THAT AS PROBABLY A BARRIER FOR YOU 
BUT I THINK WHAT JENNY AND I WOULD SAY IS THAT IT'S SO DIFFERENT TO A BUNGALOW 
THE GOOD THING ABOUT BEING UP ONE LEVEL IS YOU GET GREAT VIEWS 
YEAH SO HAVE YOU TAKEN A VIEW ON HOW MUCH THIS PROPERTY'S UP FOR THAT'S THE QUESTION 
VERY DIFFICULT IT IS 
IT IS DIFFICULT LET'S HOPE IT'S SO HARD THAT YOU GET IT WRONG OTHERWISE THERE COULD BE TROUBLE 
THERE COULD BE TROUBLE AHEAD 
SO THE BUDGET TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND ISH 
I'VE ALREADY SAID ONE I THOUGHT WAS A LITTLE BIT 
IT'S HIGHER THAN BUDGET AND ONE THAT WAS LOWER THAN BUDGET 
I THINK THIS ONE IS ABOUT BUDGET 
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND O. K. MM HMM 
O. K. LOVELY JULIE NO I THINK IT'S A BIT MORE 
I THINK IT'S SORT OF LIKE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
HE'S DONE IT AGAIN 
HE'S THE CLOSEST I'M SO SORRY JULIE BUT HE IS HE'S GOOD AT THIS 
BUT THE FLIPSIDE YEAH YOU'RE NOT THAT GOOD BECAUSE 
YOU'RE MILES OUT BOTH OF YOU THIS COMES IN AT THE MOMENT AT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
BLIMEY LOOK AT THAT FACE MILES OUT SHOCK HORROR MILES OUT 
IT'S A SHOCK ISN'T IT 
SO THIRTY THOUSAND ESPECIALLY AS IT DOESN'T NEED ANYTHING DOING TO IT DOES IT 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT WE SAID THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT WE'D NEED TO PUT OUR TOUCH ON 
EXACTLY SO ALL RIGHT SO THERE YOU GO 
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO SELL IT COS WE WANT YOU TO MAKE YOUR OWN DECISION OBVIOUSLY 
SO IF YOU WANT TO GO OFF HAVE A LITTLE CHAT 
PONDER ON THINGS SHALL WE GO AND HAVE A PONDER 
GO AND HAVE A PONDER AND A WANDER AND ONCE YOU'VE PONDERED AND WANDERED 
MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHICH PROPERTY YOU GOING TO TEST DRIVE AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE 
O. K. ALL RIGHT WE'LL SEE YOU THERE 
O. K. SEE YOU IN A MO THANK YOU SEE YOU IN A WEE BITTY 
O. K. SEE YOU COME AND JOIN ME BY THE SINK POWELL OH LOVELY 
WHILE THEY'RE OFF MAKING A TOUGH DECISION 
HERE'S A REMINDER OF THOSE THREE BEAUTIES WE'VE SHOWN THEM 
FIRST OFF MY BUNGALOW WAS THE PERFECT ANSWER TO JULIE AND GREG'S CONUNDRUM 
IT HAD SPACE A NICE GARDEN WAS IN A QUIET VILLAGE IT HAD A GARAGE 
DID I MENTION THE NATURAL STREAM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN 
AND THE BEAUTIFUL VIEWS INTO THE SHROPSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE 
I PROBABLY DIDN'T NEED TO COST TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THANK YOU 
O. K. BUT MY BUNGALOW WAS ALSO THE PERFECT ANSWER TO THEIR PROBLEM 
THEY MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THEY WERE HAPPY TO DO WORK ON A PLACE SO THAT IS WHAT I FOUND THEM 
A GREAT HOME ON A CORNER PLOT ALSO WITH STUNNING COUNTRYSIDE VIEWS 
AND WITH THE POTENTIAL TO EXTEND TO MEET THEIR NEEDS IT COULD BE THEIRS 
FOR AROUND ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE GRAND 
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THE WILD CARD ALTHOUGH A BIT OF AN UNUSUAL PROSPECT 
IT HAS A GREAT DEAL TO OFFER 
ALL READY TO MOVE INTO WITH A STYLISH MODERN INTERIOR 
AND WITH THOSE SHROPSHIRE VIEWS 
IT TOOK THEM BY SURPRISE 
BUT THE HUGE UTILITY AND DOUBLE GARAGE CATER TO JULIE AND GREG'S PRACTICAL SIDE 
A SNIP AT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
O. K. YOU TWO LOVELY PEOPLE WELL DONE 
I SAY LOVELY BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU WENT FOR A PROPERTY NUMBER ONE JENNY'S CHOICE 
YEAH IT'S ALL THAT SPACE ISN'T IT 
YEP IT'S LOVELY IT REALLY IS NICE 
O. K. WELL JUST BEFORE YOU GO IN AND DO YOUR TEST DRIVE OUR SURVEYOR HAS HAD A LOOK ROUND THE PROPERTY 
IF YOU DECIDE TO GO FURTHER WITH THIS ONE THEN GET YOUR OWN SURVEY DONE THAT IS LEGALLY BINDING 
HE'S COME UP WITH A COUPLE OF THINGS BUT IN GENERAL IT'S A GREAT PROPERTY NICE SOLID BUILDING 
BUT YOU KNOW THAT LOVELY NATURAL STREAM AT THE BACK 
WELL WHAT HE DOES SUGGEST IS THAT YOU CHECK WITH YOUR INSURANCE BROKERS THAT YOU'RE NOT IN A FLOOD ZONE 
SO COVER YOURSELVES IN THAT RESPECT YEAH 
THE OTHER THING HE NOTICED HE LIKES TO FIND SOMETHING WRONG BUT HE'S DOING HIS JOB 
WAS THAT ON ALL THE WINDOWS HE VERY CLEVERLY SPOTTED THERE AREN'T THOSE KITEMARKS 
SUGGESTING THAT THEY'RE UP TO A CERTAIN STANDARD WITH THE OLD BRITISH STANDARDS MARK 
AND THAT'S IT REALLY O. K. 
IS THERE A SAFETY ISSUE WITH THAT 
IT MEANS THAT IT'S NOT UP TO A CERTAIN STANDARD 
BUT IN OLDER HOUSES THERE ARE OLDER WINDOWS 
IT'S A BIT OF A COMMONSENSE THING BUT IT DOES SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE OLDER WINDOWS THAT'S ALL O. K. 
SO NOW IT'S JUST LEFT TO YOU TWO TO GO ON GET IN THAT PROPERTY AND ENJOY YOUR TEST DRIVE 
ALL RIGHT THEN O. K. SEE YOU LATER HAVE FUN 
SEE YOU SEE YOU LATER

HOW IT'S GOING TO FEEL THIS PLACE THE NEXT TIME YOU GO INTO IT 
SO YOU'VE COME INTO IT AGAIN DOES IT STILL FEEL AS GOOD IT DOES YEAH IT'S NICE 
IT FEELS REALLY HOMEY AND PLENTY OF ROOM FOR EVERYBODY 
SO IT'S ALL SOUNDING VERY POSITIVE IT'S SOUNDING VERY POSITIVE 
WHY DON'T WE ASK THAT QUESTION JENNY DARE WE ASK IAN I THINK WE SHOULD 
TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
WELL GOOD QUESTION 
WE ASK IT QUITE A LOT ON THIS PROGRAMME ACTUALLY YEAH WE DO YEAH 
WE'VE OBVIOUSLY DONE A LOT OF TALKING ABOUT IT AND IT'S GOOD IT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
IT IS A BIG DECISION AND OUR FINAL DECISION SO THERE WAS STILL ONE OR TWO MORE BITS 
THAT WE'D LIKE TO FIGURE OUT ABOUT AND ONCE WE'VE DONE THAT BIG DECISION 
YEAH AND ONCE WE'VE DONE THAT WE WILL COME BACK TO THEM AND BUT WE ARE VERY 
WE ARE NINETY EIGHT PER CENT THE WAY OF MAKING A DECISION TO SAY YES WOW 
O. K. SO IT'S ALL VERY POSITIVE 
IT'S NOT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT IT'S A COMMONSENSE TO BUY 
IT'S A TO BUY IF CERTAIN THINGS ALL FIT INTO PLACE 
BUT LIKE I SAY IT'S NOT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT BUT IT'S A BIG DECISION WE DON'T WANT TO RUSH IT 
AND TO BE FAIR YOU WANT TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION BECAUSE HAVING MOVED TWENTY FIVE TIMES TWENTY FIVE 
AND YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO IT AGAIN AFTER THE NEXT ONE NO 
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET IT RIGHT WE DO ABSOLUTELY GOOD 
WELL BEST OF LUCK AND HOPE THAT EVERYTHING DOES COME OUT THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO 
WE'VE HAD A LOVELY TIME SO HOPEFULLY YOU FIND YOUR FINAL RESTING PLACE AH 
IN A HAPPY WAY AND ENJOY LIVING WHEREVER YOU END UP 
THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU TAKE CARE CAN I TAKE MY TEA
