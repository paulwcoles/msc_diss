EIGHTY SIX STRAIGHT DAYS OF SUNSHINE YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT 
SETTLING INTO A NEW LIFE IS NOT EASY FOR THE BENNET FAMILY 
AND IT SEEMS JUST BEING HONEST IS THE HARDEST TASK OF ALL 
NIGHT CLAIRE 
NIGHT DAD 
THEY'RE LIVING IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME 
YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR A FEW MONTHS BUTLER I THINK IT'S TIME I SAW SOME COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE FROM YOU 
THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR NAMES TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE EVIL DOERS OUT THERE 
THAT COULD BE AFTER MY LOVELY DAUGHTER CLAIRE 
YOU MAY FEEL CONFINED HERE BUT THIS IS FAR FREER A CAGE THAN THE ONE THEY'D PUT YOU IN 
SHE HAS TO TRY NOT TO STAND OUT COS STANDING OUT CAN MEAN SOMETIMES BEING FOUND 
AND THAT'S THE LAST THING THEY NEED RIGHT NOW 
THERE'S A KIND OF TENSION AND PRESSURE 
TO THE IDEA OF PEOPLE LIVING A LIE 
THAT'S GOING TO START TO CATCH UP WITH THEM 
CALIFORNIA LOVE BY TWO P. A C. FEATURING DOCTOR D. R. E. 
I WAS EXCITED WHEN WE WERE GONNA RESET THE BENNETS INTO A NEW ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA 
IRONICALLY WE FILM IN CALIFORNIA AND ALMOST NONE OF OUR STORIES LAST YEAR TOOK PLACE THERE 
I WANTED TO REALLY ACCENTUATE THE BEACH SETTING 
THE IRONY WAS FUN THEY WERE LIVING IN THIS BEAUTIFUL COASTAL Y'KNOW 
AMERICAN DREAM CALIFORNIA DREAM ENVIRONMENT 
AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE IN HIDING AND UNDER PRESSURE 
WE SEE THEM IN A SORT OF STEVEN SPIELBERG SUBURB 
YOU CAN IMAGINE E. T. TAKING PLACE THERE 
WITH LOTS OF COOKIE CUTTER HOMES 
SO THEY'RE TRYING TO BE AS NON DESCRIPT AS POSSIBLE AND LIVE OUT A VERY ANONYMOUS LIFE 
WE WANTED A PLACE WHERE THE BENNETS COULD KIND OF HIDE 
OR BE A LITTLE BIT INVISIBLE YOU KNOW 
BEING PART OF A WITNESS PROTECTION PLAN THEY SHOULD BE ONE FAMILY AMONG MILLIONS 
THAT ALL KIND OF DRESS THE SAME LOOK THE SAME HAVE THE SAME KIND OF HOUSES 
WE WANTED THE HOUSE TO BE LIKE A MODEL HOME IN THAT THEY DIDN'T CHOOSE ANY OF THE FURNITURE 
THEY DIDN'T BRING ANYTHING PERSONAL WITH THEM 
IT WAS ALL SET UP FOR THEM JUST TO ARRIVE AND TRY TO LIVE THEIR LIVES 
WE FOUND A HOUSE THAT EVERYBODY LIKED AND ONCE WE DECIDED ON AN EXTERIOR 
RUTH WAS ABLE TO TAKE THE ARCHITECTURAL ELEMENTS 
OF THE EXTERIOR OF THAT HOUSE 
AND INCORPORATE THEM INTO THE DESIGN OF THE INTERIOR WHICH IS HERE ON STAGE 
WE KNEW WITH THE BENNETS THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE COMING AND GOING AT ALL TIMES OF THE DAY AND NIGHT 
SO WE WANTED A WAY TO SNEAK PEOPLE IN DOORS IN THE BACK YARD DOORS IN THE SIDE 
A WAY FOR HRG TO ESCAPE WITHOUT CLAIRE AND MOM SEEING HIM 
WE ALL MARVEL WE BENNETS WE BENNET BUTLERS 
THAT HRG IS AS WELL PAID AS HE IS AT COPY KINGDOM 
TO AFFORD THIS LOVELY NEW HOME IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS 
AND I HAVE A GREAT KITCHEN 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BACK ON THE FLOOR FIVE MINUTES AGO 
THERE'S A LINE OF CUSTOMERS OUT THERE 
POOR NOAH BENNET HAS NOW TAKEN A DEMOTION 
AND IS NOW WORKING BASICALLY AT A COPY FACILITY 
I'M WORKING AT COPY KINGDOM WHICH IS IT'S TOUGH COS I HAVE AN OFFICIOUS OBNOXIOUS LITTLE BOSS 
WHO IS ALWAYS IN MY FACE IT'S REALLY HARD FOR NOAH TO PUT UP WITH HIM 
AND IN FACT HE REALLY DOESN'T PUT UP WITH HIM FOR VERY LONG 
NOW YOU HEAR ME I AM DONE EATING YOUR CRAP 
FROM NOW ON I WILL WORK HOW AND WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT 
I WILL TAKE BREAKS WHEN I WANT TO AND YOU WILL NOT SAY A DAMN WORD TO ME EVER AGAIN 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND YEAH 
WE REALLY WANTED TO SEE HRG IN PURPLE 
WE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE MOST HUMILIATING COLOUR FOR HRG TO BE IN AND INDEED IT WAS 
I HAD ONLY ONE REQUEST WHICH WAS NOT BRIGHT RED 
SO THEY SAID O. K. HOW DOES PURPLE SOUND WE'LL MAKE YOU LIKE BARNEY THE DINOSAUR 
WHICH WAS NOT ERM NECESSARILY MY CHOICE BUT I SUPPOSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE 
BUT IT COULDN'T GET MUCH WORSE FOR CLAIRE BENNET THE INDESTRUCTIBLE TEENAGER 
WHO'S JUST TRYING TO FIT IN 
YE EAH 
I'M A FREAK 
OF NATURE 
FREAK 
FREAK 
IF THE FIRST SEASON WAS ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO ARE SUDDENLY IMBUED WITH EXTRAORDINARY ABILITIES 
THE PITCH ON THE SECOND SEASON WAS 
ONCE YOU DISCOVER YOU'RE EXTRAORDINARY HOW DO YOU GO BACK TO BEING ORDINARY 
THAT CERTAINLY WAS SHOWN IN CLAIRE'S DILEMMA WHICH WAS SHE WAS TRYING TO BE A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT 
SHE WAS TRYING TO HAVE A ROMANCE WITH A BOY AND IT JUST SPUN OUT OF CONTROL 
BECAUSE THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS YOU CAN'T STOP BEING WHO YOU ARE 
THE NEW EXISTENCE THE NEW LIFE IS VERY HARD ON CLAIRE 
BECAUSE YET AGAIN SHE HAS TO TRY TO STAY UNDERGROUND 
I KIND OF READ HER THE RIOT ACT ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL 
TRUST ME THE COMPANY IS STILL OUT THERE AND THEY WILL FIND US UNLESS WE'RE FLAWLESS WITH OUR PLAN 
FROM NOW ON YOU HAVE TO BE ENTIRELY UN EXTRAORDINARY 
I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE MEETS THIS BOY 
WHO'S ALL ABOUT TRYING TO GET HER TO ADMIT HOW SPECIAL SHE IS 
IN TWO DIRECTIONS AND SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE 
ARE YOU ONE OF THEM 
OR ONE OF THE OTHERS I'M NOT SURE I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT 
LET ME BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU ARE YOU A ROBOT OR AN ALIEN 
CLAIRE IS THROWN AND SAD AND 
YOU KNOW HAVING A HARD TIME FITTING INTO THE STATUS QUO 
WHEN SHE IS SO DEFINITELY NOT THE DEFINITION OF STATUS QUO 
I WANT YOU TO ADMIT YOU'RE DIFFERENT 
O. K. FINE I'M A FREAK ALL RIGHT CLAIRE 
I AM SUCH A FREAK I HAVE TO TIP TOE AROUND THIS SCHOOL PRETENDING 
TO BE SOME BRAINLESS BARBIE DOLL SO NOBODY NOTICES HOW DIFFERENT I AM 
SHE'S ALWAYS SUBLIMATING ALMOST EVERYTHING ABOUT HERSELF AND HER PERSONALITY AND HER IDENTITY 
AND SHE HAS ALL THESE QUESTIONS 
IN SEASON ONE SHE WAS EXPERIMENTING SAYING YEP I HEAL 
IN THE SECOND SEASON SHE'S SAYING 
O. K. TO WHAT EXTENT DO I HEAL HOW DOES IT WORK WHAT DOES IT MEAN 
SHE'S ON THE QUEST TO FIGURE OUT HOW HIGH HER PAIN TOLERANCE IS' 
SHE'S BECOME SO USED TO IT 
THAT SHE DOESN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT GETTING HURT ANY MORE 
SO SHE PROBABLY GETS HURT MORE 
ARGH 
ARGH AH 
TEENAGERS TEST THINGS 
BUT CLAIRE HAS SUPER POWERS SO HER TESTING OF COURSE 
IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN MY DAUGHTER'S TESTING OF ME YOU KNOW 
THAT KEPT BUILDING SO THAT WHEN SHE'S IN THE CLASSROOM AND GETS THAT INFORMATION ABOUT REGENERATION 
LIZARDS ARE CAPABLE OF CELLULAR REGENERATION 
THE VIDEO DEMONSTRATES THE NEWT'S AMAZING ABILITY TO REGROW A COMPLETELY WORKING LIMB 
YOU SEE THE SALAMANDER'S ARM YOU KNOW HAND BEING CLIPPED OFF AND IT GROWING BACK 
IT SORT OF SETS IN YOUR MIND AND CLAIRE'S TALKING AND YOU AS A VIEWER GOING 
OH SHE'S CRAZY YOU CAN'T DO THAT THAT'S A SALAMANDER 
SO EVEN THOUGH SHE'S MULLING THIS THOUGHT YOU AS A VIEWER ARE GOING 
O. K. YEAH BUT SHE'S JUST CONJECTURING 
THERE'S JUST THAT GREAT MOMENT WHERE SHE BEHOLDS HER TOE AND LOOKS AT IT AND SHE'S GOT THE SCISSORS 
AND THE AUDIENCE JUST GOES OH NO 
AH 
IT'S SO MUCH FUN TO WATCH THAT SEQUENCE WITH PEOPLE COS THEY ALL REACT AT THE EXACT SAME MOMENT 
I DON'T WANNA SEE IT NO NO I DON'T WANNA LOOK AT IT 
GROW BACK 
NO WAY 
AND IT WAS THE COMBINED MAGIC OF COMPUTER EFFECTS AND PROSTHETIC MODELS 
THAT MANAGED TO PULL OFF THIS AMAZING FEET 
FOR THAT SCENE WE BUILT TWO LEGS 
THAT STARTS OUT AS A FULL FOOT UN MARRED 
WITH THAT LITTLE GUY ON 
SHE REACHES DOWN AND CUTS IT 
BOOM OFF BECAUSE IT'S RUBBER VERY RESILIENT IT'S UNDER A BIT OF A SPRING TENSION 
AND OFF SHE GOES 
THE ORIGINAL IDEA WAS THAT THE TOE GETS CUT AND THEN SHE BRINGS THE LITTLE PIECE OF TOE 
AND HOLDS IT TOGETHER AND THEY GROW BACK TOGETHER 
WE COULDN'T FIND THE TIME ON THE SHOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN 
SO WE DECIDED IT WAS SIMPLER AND CLEANER TO JUST HAVE IT REGENERATE 
IT WAS ALSO EXACTLY LIKE THE BIOLOGY CLASS FILM THAT YOU HAD SEEN 
THE ERM C. G. I. I THINK WORKED 
BECAUSE WE START WITH A PROSTHETIC TOE AT THE VERY BEGINNING 
WHEN SHE STARTS CUTTING 
AND YOU SEE THE PRESSURE OF THE SCISSORS ON THE SKIN 
IT LOOKS SO REAL THAT YOUR BRAIN IS ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT THIS IS REAL EVEN THOUGH IT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE 
BECAUSE NOBODY WOULD ACTUALLY KNOW HOW A TOE WOULD REGROW FROM INSIDE OUT 
IT WAS A LOT OF TRIAL AND ERROR AND A LOT OF GUT FEELING 
SO AFTER IT'S STARRING ROLE 
WHERE DID THIS DELICATE DIGIT FINALLY END UP 
MY GIRLFRIEND STOPPED BY NOT LONG AGO AND STUMBLED ON IT AND KIND OF FREAKED OUT A LITTLE BIT 
AND THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S FREAKING OUT AFTER GAZING IN ON THIS TOE CURLING SCENE 
IT WAS A PEDICURE 
I'M SORRY THE OTHER NIGHT THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING I WAS GIVING MYSELF A PEDICURE 
YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT IT 
HE COMES AT HER WITH SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS AT FIRST 
NATURALLY SHE'S TAKEN ABACK 
WHY ARE YOU SUCH A SMART ASS WHY ARE YOU SO BAD AT LYING 
I'M NOT LYING FINE YOU GAVE CAME OFF AND THEN CAME BACK ON 
WORKS FOR ME I'M GOING TO CLASS 
THEN SHE GRADUALLY BEGINS TO TRUST THE SINCERITY OF WHERE HE'S COMING FROM 
IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST TRYING TO MESS WITH HER HE FINDS HER INTERESTING 
THAT BRINGS THEM TOGETHER 
I'M DIFFERENT AND YOU CAN TELL THE WORLD BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF PRETENDING TO BE SOMEONE I'M NOT 
CLAIRE 
SHUT UP 
YOUR LOVE LIFTING ME HIGHER 
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN LIFTED BEFORE 
HE FLIES HER TO THE BEACH HE'S REALLY SUAVE HE'S VERY SUAVE WITH HIS FLYING ABILITY 
YOU KNOW YOUR LOVE YOUR LOVE KEEPS LIFTING ME 
KEEP ON LIFTING 
HIGHER 
HIGHER AND HIGHER 
I SAID YOUR LOVE YOUR LOVE KEEPS LIFTING ME 
KEEP ON 
ACTION 
SO HOW WOULD IT FEEL IF I DO THIS OW IT HURTS STOP WHAT ABOUT THIS 
FOR CLAIRE TO HAVE FOUND WEST AND WEST TO HAVE FOUND CLAIRE MUST BE AMAZING 
TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE ON THE PLANET WHO CAN DO FANTASTIC THINGS LIKE SHE CAN 
IT IS RATHER CUTE 
THIS SCENE IS CLAIRE'S FIRST KISS WITH THIS GUY 
THE NEW BOY ON THE BEACH HAVING A LITTLE GOOFY SCENE 
BUT HE HAS A SECRET 
WHAT'S ON YOUR NECK 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN WE LIVED IN SAINT LOUIS 
I WAS RIDING MY BIKE TO SCHOOL 
AND NEXT THING I KNEW IT WAS A DAY LATER AND I WAS WAKING UP IN MY BED 
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO WEST IS WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE CAME FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HIM 
WHAT HIS FAMILY'S LIKE 
JUST THE BEGINNING INKLINGS OF THAT HAPPEN IN THIS PARTICULAR EPISODE 
LAST THING I REMEMBER IS THIS MAN STEPPING OUT OF THE BUSHES CALLING MY NAME 
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WHAT MAN 
THE GUY WITH THE HORN RIMMED GLASSES 
IT'S ONE THING TO BE BAGGING AND TAGGING SPECIALS BUT IT'S SOMETHING ELSE TO HAVE DONE IT TO A CHILD 
IT ADDS TO THE RETURN OF HER PARANOIA AND DISTRUST OF HER FATHER 
BUT CLAIRE'S NOT THE ONLY MEMBER OF HER FAMILY WITH A GOOD REASON TO FEEL PARANOID 
I'M SENDING YOU A JPEG OF A PAINTING I'VE FOUND 
THE REST HAVE BEEN SHIPPED OFF IT'S THE LAST IN THE SERIES EIGHT OF EIGHT 
WE KNOW HOW IT BEGINS WITH THE DEATH OF KAITO NAKAMURA BUT HOW DOES IT END 
NOT WELL I'M AFRAID 
I THINK AT THIS STAGE HRG IS VERY AFRAID I THINK THAT EVERYTHING 
THERE'S THAT MOMENT WHERE HE'S LOOKING AT THE PICTURE ON HIS COMPUTER SCREEN 
AND TAKING IN THAT CLAIRE MAY BE COMPLICIT IN HIS DEATH 
THEN SUDDENLY SHE APPEARS OUTSIDE THE DOOR WITH THE BLINDS SHE COMES CREEPING IN 
IT WAS JUST A GREAT REVERSAL OF SO MANY EPISODES FROM THE PREVIOUS SEASON 
WHERE YOU SEE POOR LITTLE INNOCENT CLAIRE AND THIS DARK LURKING FATHER IN THE BACKGROUND 
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS SWEET LITTLE FACE TAKES ON A VERY DIFFERENT MEANING 
NIGHT CLAIRE 
NIGHT DAD 
HE'S REALLY OUT OF HIS COMFORT ZONE OF WHAT HE USED TO DO 
WHICH WAS GO AFTER PEOPLE AND NOW IT'S ALL ABOUT 
KEEPING HIMSELF OUT OF HARM'S WAY I THINK AT THIS POINT 
AND EVEN THOUGH HE'S TRYING TO TELL HIMSELF IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT 
EVENTUALLY HE HAS TO COME CLEAN AND ADMIT THAT IT IS 
THERE'S TROUBLE AHEAD FOR THE BUTLERS 
AS CLAIRE CONTINUES TO GO BEHIND HER DAD'S BACK
