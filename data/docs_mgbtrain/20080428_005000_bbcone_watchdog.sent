THE GUARANTEE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT NEW HOMES SO WHY DOES IT TAKE YEARS TO SORT OUT THESE CRACKS 
AND WHY WHEN SOMEBODY GIVES YOU A VOUCHER FOR A BUDGET AIRLINE YOU MIGHT WISH THEY HAD NOT BOTHERED 
THAT'S WATCHDOG TONIGHT 
HELLO WELCOME TO WATCHDOG LIVE FROM THE OFFICE 
WHERE WE HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH E. MAILS ON A STORY WE TOLD YOU ABOUT LAST MONDAY 
A FAULT WITH BRITAIN'S MOST POPULAR CAR THE FORD FOCUS 
YES WE HAVE HAD A BIGGER RESPONSE TO THIS THAN ANY OTHER STORY THIS YEAR 
OVER FIVE HUNDRED OF YOU TELL US IT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU 
WE'LL SEE WHAT FORD HAVE TO SAY LATER ON WHEN WE'LL ALSO BE HEARING HOW THEIR FAULT HAS LEFT SOME OF YOU 
WITH A FINE FOR SPEEDING AND POINTS ON YOUR LICENCE 
NOT A RECORD ANYONE WANTS 
BUT THAT IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF 
THANKS TO BLUNDERS BY THE CRIMINAL RECORDS BUREAU 
ONE MAN HAD NO LESS THAN THIRTY CONVICTIONS AGAINST HIS NAME WHEN HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OF THEM 
THEY HAD BEEN THERE FOR THE BEST PART OF TWENTY YEARS 
SO ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS MIGHT HAVE 
HE IS FURIOUS ABOUT WHAT THIS MISTAKE COULD HAVE COST HIM 
I WAS VERY ANGRY AT THAT TIME AND I STILL AM TO THIS DAY TO BE HONEST 
I DON'T FEEL THAT JUSTICE HAS BEEN DONE 
THE WHOLE STORY AND OTHER PROBLEMS COMING UP 
AND SOMEBODY FROM THE CRIMINAL RECORDS BUREAU WILL BE HERE TO EXPLAIN IT ALL 
YOU CAN TEXT US THIS EVENING ABOUT ANY OF OUR STORIES 
IT WILL COST YOU THE PRICE OF A STANDARD TEXT 
WE'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU YOU CAN EMAIL OR CALL AS WELL 
WE'LL BE READING THEM OUT AT THE END OF THE PROGRAMME 
PAUL HEINEY HAS BEEN HEARING ABOUT AN INGENIOUS WAY 
THAT BUDGET AIRLINES CAN SQUEEZE MORE MONEY OUT OF US 
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE BETTER TO GIVE THAN RECEIVE SO WHY IS CHOOSING A PRESENT SO DIFFICULT 
AN EASIER OPTION FOR EVERYBODY COULD BE A GIFT VOUCHER ESPECIALLY AS NOW YOU CAN GET ONE FOR EVERYTHING 
YOU CAN EVEN GET A VOUCHER FOR FLIGHTS ON BUDGET AIRLINES 
WHAT A GREAT PRESENT A TICKET TO ANYWHERE 
SO WHY DO SOME PEOPLE FEEL THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN A TICKET TO NOWHERE 
BUDAPEST A CITY THAT KATHRYN BENNETT REALLY WANTED TO VISIT 
BUT THE CLOSEST SHE HAS GOT IS READING THE GUIDE BOOK IN THIS CAFE 
EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS TRIED TO BOOK A TRIP THERE WITH RYANAIR GIFT VOUCHERS HER SON GAVE HER FOR CHRISTMAS 
WE'VE DECIDED ON BUDAPEST BECAUSE IT SEEMED MORE EXOTIC AND EXCITING 
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING VISIT 
RYANAIR EXPECT THEIR CUSTOMERS TO DO EVERYTHING ONLINE EXCEPT REDEEM GIFT VOUCHERS 
INSTEAD YOU HAVE TO PHONE THEM AT TEN P. PER MINUTE 
BUT KATHRYN COULD NOT GET THROUGH DESPITE TRYING ON MANY OCCASIONS 
IT WAS A CASE OF PHONING THE NUMBER AND BEING CUT OFF IMMEDIATELY 
ONLY ONCE IN ALL THAT TIME DID I SPEAK TO A REAL PERSON AND THEN WE WERE CUT OFF AFTER THREE MINUTES 
THE TEN P. PER MINUTE BOOKING LINE IS ONLY OPEN FROM NINE HUNDRED A M. TO FIVE FORTY FIVE P. M. MONDAY TO FRIDAY 
PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT HOURS KATHRYN IS AT WORK 
BOOKING OUTSIDE THOSE HOURS MEANT CALLING A NUMBER COSTING ONE A MINUTE WHICH KATHRYN WAS NOT PREPARED TO DO 
SO SHE COULDN'T USE HER VOUCHERS IN TIME FOR THE EASTER HOLIDAYS 
I AM ANGRY THAT RYANAIR ARE AN ONLINE COMPANY AND THEY MAKE THEIR NAME BY BEING AN ONLINE COMPANY 
YET THEY'VE NOT GOT THE FACILITIES TO PUT A CODE FROM A GIFT VOUCHER ON A BOOKING FORM ON THEIR WEBSITE 
TO ME THAT BEGGARS BELIEF TO BE HONEST 
REDEEMING YOUR RYANAIR VOUCHER MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME 
BUT IF YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN ONE FROM RIVAL EASYJET YOU COULD HAVE A DIFFERENT PROBLEM ALTOGETHER 
OUTRAGEOUSLY USING YOUR GIFT TO PAY FOR A FLIGHT 
CAN COST YOU MORE THAN IF YOU HAD PAID FOR IT YOURSELF 
LEANDER LAURENCE WANTS TO GO TO TURKEY IN SEPTEMBER 
AND FOUND FLIGHTS FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE ON THE EASYJET WEBSITE 
SHE HAD SOME EASYJET VOUCHERS BUT YOU CAN'T USE THEM ONLINE 
YOU HAVE TO CALL UP WHICH LEANDER DID 
AND WAS TOLD SHE COULD NOT HAVE THE WEBSITE FARE AND WOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE 
THE PRICE I WAS QUOTED WAS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE 
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS RATHER A LOT MORE 
CONSIDERING I WAS BOOKING THE SAME FLIGHTS AS MY FRIEND 
LEANDER WAS DESPERATE TO GET HER SEAT ON THAT FLIGHT SO SHE HAD TO PAY UP 
I FELT VERY UPSET THAT I HAD TO PAY THE EXTRA MONEY 
WHEN I TOLD MY FRIENDS THEY WERE UPSET TOO BECAUSE THEY HAD BOUGHT THE VOUCHER FOR ME 
AND COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I HAD HAD TO PAY MORE FOR THE AIR FARE THAN THEY'D PAID THEMSELVES 
IT'S A PITY SHE DID NOT READ THE SMALL PRINT ON THE VOUCHER 
BECAUSE SHE'D HAVE SEEN THAT ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE TO BOOK ON THE TELEPHONE 
YOU ARE STILL ENTITLED TO THE WEB FARES AND DISCOUNTS 
SHE WOULD THEN HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING ABLE TO TELL EASYJET 
THEY WERE BREAKING THEIR OWN TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
WE RANG EASYJET TO BOOK A FLIGHT USING A GIFT VOUCHER 
WE HAD ALREADY SEEN THE FIGHT AND THE PRICE WE WANTED ON THEIR WEBSITE 
AND AS THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS SAY THIS FARE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FINE 
BUT LIKE LEANDER WE WERE TOLD IT WASN'T 
AND THERE IS ANOTHER COSTLY PROBLEM WHEN YOU BOOK OVER THE PHONE 
SUE AND MICHAEL AYLES WERE GIVEN ONE HUNDRED WORTH OF EASYJET VOUCHERS AS A WEDDING PRESENT FROM THEIR BEST MAN 
AND THEY WANTED TO USE THEM TO BOOK A FLIGHT TO PARIS 
I LOOKED ON THE INTERNET IT WAS JUST OVER SEVENTY 
I REALISED I COULDN'T BOOK ONLINE 
SO I HAD TO GIVE THEM A CALL ON THEIR PREMIUM RATE NUMBER AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE ONE HUNDRED TWELVE 
THAT'S FORTY MORE AND I FEEL CHEATED 
SUE WAS EVEN MORE FURIOUS WHEN SHE GOT HER TELEPHONE BILL 
EASYJET'S BOOKING LINE COSTS SIXTY FIVE P. A MINUTE FROM A LANDLINE 
SHE CALLED FROM HER MOBILE SO THE TOTAL COST WAS OVER TWENTY 
COMBINED WITH THE HIGHER PRICE OF THEIR TICKET TO PARIS 
THEY'VE PAID SIXTY MORE THAN IF THEY HAD BOOKED ONLINE 
THANKS EASYJET THE MOST DISAPPOINTING THING IS THAT EASYJET ARE AN ONLINE BUSINESS 
MY BEST MAN BOUGHT THE TICKETS ONLINE WE RECEIVED THE TICKETS ONLINE 
BUT WE STILL COULDN'T REDEEM THEM ONLINE 
WE FEEL AS IF WE HAVE BEEN PENALISED FOR HAVING A GIFT 
EASYJET CALL THEIR VOUCHERS THE ULTIMATE GIFT AND THEY ARE FOR THEM 
WHEN THEY'VE FOUND A WAY OF MAKING MONEY OUT OF YOU AND THE PERSON WHO BOUGHT THEM 
YOU WONDER IF THESE AIRLINES ARE BLESSED WITH THE GIFT OF THE GRAB 
M. M. M. WELL RYANAIR STAND BY THEIR METHODS FOR BOOKING WITH A GIFT VOUCHER 
AND MAINTAIN THAT THEY ARE PERFECTLY FAIR 
EASYJET HAVE APOLOGISED AND SAY THE CASES IN OUR FILM SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE WEB FARES 
AND WILL BE REFUNDING THEM 
THEY BLAME THE MIX UP ON TEETHING PROBLEMS WHEN TRANSFERRING TO NEW TELEPHONE SALES CENTRES 
IN A FEW MINUTES THE NATIONAL HOUSE BUILDING COUNCIL WILL BE HERE TO EXPLAIN THIS ONE 
WHY OVER ONE MILLION HOMEOWNERS HAVE A GUARANTEE THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS OFFER THE PROTECTION THEY'D HOPE 
CRACKS IN YOUR HOME ARE USUALLY NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 
BUT WHEN THEY LOOK LIKE THIS YOU COULD BE IN TROUBLE 
YOUR HOUSE COULD BE MOVING AND THE CAUSE SUBSIDENCE 
WHEN THAT HAPPENS WITH A NEW BUILD HOME YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE 
A TEN YEAR WARRANTY FROM THE NATIONAL HOUSE BUILDING COUNCIL 
IT'S A GUARANTEE THAT IF SOMETHING GOES BADLY WRONG THEY WILL BE ROUND TO SORT IT OUT 
BUT THAT PROMISE HAS A FEW CRACKS OF ITS OWN 
EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF BRITAIN'S NEW HOMES ARE BUILT BY MEMBERS OF THE NHBC 
AND AUTOMATICALLY COVERED BY THEIR WARRANTY THE BUILDMARK POLICY 
THEY'LL PAY TO PUT RIGHT ANY MAJOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY POOR BUILDING 
BUT THEY MIGHT NOT EXACTLY RUSH TO HELP YOU OUT 
ELEVEN YEARS AGO HELEN STAUB BOUGHT A NEW HOUSE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MANCHESTER 
I HAD JUST GOT DIVORCED AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
AND I WANTED A PROPERTY THAT I KNOW I'M GOING TO FEEL SAFE IN 
I WON'T NEED RETILING OR REWIRING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
THE BUILDER KEPT SAYING YOU'RE SAFE COS IT'S GOT A TEN YEAR GUARANTEE I THOUGHT BRILLIANT 
BUT SOON AFTER MOVING INTO HER NEW HOUSE SHE HEARD LOUD CREAKING NOISES 
HER HOUSE WAS SINKING INTO ITS FOUNDATIONS 
I WAS SEEING CRACKS OUTSIDE AND INSIDE 
IT SEEMED LIKE EVERY TIME YOU TURNED ANOTHER CRACK APPEARED 
AND THE SOUNDS ARE JUST HORRENDOUS 
I WAS REALLY FRIGHTENED REALLY FRIGHTENED 
HELEN WAS HORRIFIED ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HER NEW HOME 
AND IT WASN'T JUST HER HOUSE THAT HAD A PROBLEM 
ALL THE NEIGHBOURS HAD IT TOO 
THE SIX HOUSES IN HER TERRACE WERE ALL SUBSIDING 
VICKY AND NEIL SLATER LIVE TWO DOORS DOWN FROM HELEN 
THERE WERE CRACKS APPEARING IN THE PROPERTY CRACKS IN THE BATHROOM 
CRACKING THROUGH ACTUAL TILES 
CRACKS IN THE KITCHEN CRACKS IN THE OUTSIDE WALLS IN THE GARAGE 
WE WERE VERY FRIGHTENED THAT THE HOUSE MIGHT BE FALLING DOWN 
WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILD 
HELEN IMMEDIATELY GOT ON TO HER HOUSE INSURERS 
THEY SENT AN ENGINEER TO INSPECT IT AND HE SAID THE FOUNDATIONS WERE TOTALLY INADEQUATE 
AND THE NHBC SHOULD FIX THEM UNDER THE TERMS OF HER GUARANTEE 
BUT THE NHBC REFUSED SAYING THE PROBLEM WASN'T SERIOUS ENOUGH 
WHAT DO YOU REQUIRE 
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO MAKE YOU SIT UP AND REALISE 
IF THE FOUNDATIONS ARE NO GOOD THEN THE BUILDING IS NO GOOD 
BUT THE NHBC KEPT SAYING THAT UNLESS THERE'S BIG HOLES YOU'VE GOT NO VALID CLAIM 
WORRIED SICK ABOUT THEIR PROPERTIES THE RESIDENTS CLUBBED TOGETHER AND FOUGHT THE NHBC'S DECISION 
AFTER THREE YEARS THE NHBC FINALLY ACCEPTED THAT THIS WAS MAJOR DAMAGE 
AND AGREED TO FIX ALL SIX HOMES 
BUT THAT WAS LAST JULY 
SINCE THEN NOTHING HAS BEEN FIXED AND THE CRACKS ARE GETTING WORSE 
IT WAS LAST SUMMER AND I WAS SAT OUTSIDE WASHING THE PATIO TABLE 
I HEARD THIS ALMIGHTY CRASH AND IT WAS MORTAR THAT HAD FALLEN FROM THE ROOF 
THE SUBSIDENCE IS GETTING WORSE WE'RE NOTICING MORE AND MORE CRACKS 
THE LENGTH OF TIME NHBC IS TAKING TO DEAL WITH IT IS GOING ON AND ON 
SURVEYOR BARRY CROSS HAS EXAMINED THE HOUSES 
HE THINKS THE NHBC'S DELAYS ARE DISGRACEFUL 
SUBSIDENCE IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE ON THIS PROPERTY 
AND IT'S GETTING WORSE 
I DO NOT KNOW WHY THE NHBC ARE DRAGGING THEIR FEET 
ON WHAT IS AFTER ALL A VERY SERIOUS MATTER IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
WHEN THEY'VE GIVEN YOU A GUARANTEE YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR YEARS FOR THE NHBC TO FIX YOUR HOME 
AND IF THEY DO HAVE A CRACK AT FIXING IT YOU MIGHT WISH THEY HADN'T BOTHERED 
PRUE DUNDAS PETRIE IS A CATERER AND IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE SHE FOUND THE PERFECT HOUSE 
ONE THAT SHE COULD LIVE AND WORK IN 
SHE BOUGHT IT OFF PLAN FROM FAIRVIEW HOMES AND IT CAME WITH A TEN YEAR NHBC GUARANTEE 
BUT TWO YEARS LATER IT WAS SUBSIDING AND LARGE CRACKS DEVELOPED IN THE WALLS 
SHE CONTACTED THE NHBC AND AFTER THREE YEARS OF WRANGLING THEY FINALLY CAME TO FIX THEM 
IT WAS A HUGE JOB INVOLVING NEW FOUNDATIONS SO SHE MOVED OUT 
AND WHEN IT WAS COMPLETED SHE BELIEVED HER PROBLEMS WERE OVER 
HAVING MOVED OUT FOR SEVEN MONTHS WHICH WAS A LONG TIME 
I ACTUALLY MOVED BACK AND I WAS DELIGHTED 
EXCITED THRILLED TO HAVE MY HOUSE BACK 
BUT TWO MONTHS LATER THE CRACKS RETURNED 
SOME IN PLACES THEY HADN'T BEEN BEFORE 
THE NHBC BUILDERS HADN'T FIXED IT AND THE HOUSE WAS SUBSIDING AGAIN 
IN A LETTER TO HER NEIGHBOURS THE NHBC EVEN ADMITTED THEY HAD BOTCHED THE JOB 
AND WERE GUILTY OF POOR WORKMANSHIP 
BARRY CROSS HAS HAD A LOOK AND HE AGREES 
I SEE FROM THE SCHEDULE OF WORKS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED EXPANSION JOINTS 
IN THE FIRST ROUND OF WORKS AND THEY DIDN'T DO THAT 
I FIND THAT ABSOLUTELY BAFFLING I ALSO UNDERSTAND THEY LEFT TEMPORARY SUPPORT JACKS UNDER THE FOUNDATIONS 
THAT IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE 
THE WORK HAS GOT TO BE DONE AGAIN AND IT HAS TO BE DONE PROPERLY 
MEANWHILE PRUE'S FOUNDATIONS CONTINUE TO MOVE 
I CAN GET MY FINGER IN THAT CRACK I KNOW IT'S REALLY DEEP 
LOOK AT THAT I KNOW IT'S ENORMOUS 
NONE OF THIS WAS HERE BEFORE IT WAS REPILED 
IT GOES ALL THE WAY ACROSS HERE ALL THE WAY THROUGH UP 
LOOK IT'S CRACKED THE WINDOWSILL 
IT GOES ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH THE ALARM TO THE ROOF TO THE TOP OF THE HOUSE 
AND IT'S A SERIOUS SITUATION FOR PRUE AND THE OTHERS 
IF LEFT UNTREATED SUBSIDENCE CAN HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR YOUR HOME 
SUBSIDENCE IS BAD NEWS IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE SINGLE BIGGEST ISSUES THAT CAN AFFECT A PROPERTY 
THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY IS LIKELY TO PLUMMET TO A FRACTION OF ITS MARKET VALUE 
AND IT'LL CERTAINLY BECOME UNMORTGAGEABLE 
AFTER HAVING FOUGHT FOR SO LONG 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NHBC GUARANTEE ACTUALLY IS 
BECAUSE IT'S GUARANTEED NOTHING FOR ME 
WE'VE WAITED FOUR YEARS FOR THE NHBC JUST TO TRY AND SORT US OUT 
I FEEL VERY VERY ANGRY 
THE NHBC WARRANTY IS SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU PEACE OF MIND BUT ALL THESE PEOPLE GOT WAS EXTRA HASSLE 
AFTER ALL THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH FORGET ABOUT THE WALLS 
THEY'RE CLOSE TO CRACKING TOO 
WITH ME NOW IS IMTIAZ FAROOKHI CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF NHBC 
CAN YOU CLOSE YOUR FRONT DOOR WHEN YOU GET HOME AT NIGHT 
I CAN BECAUSE PRUE CAN'T BECAUSE OF SUBSIDENCE 
YOU CAN ALMOST SKI DOWN HER KITCHEN FLOOR HER WINDOWS ARE FALLING OUT 
PRUE AND HELEN ARE LISTENING TO THEIR HOMES CRACKING APART AROUND THEIR EARS 
WHY ARE YOU TAKING SO LONG TO DEAL WITH THESE CASES 
MY HEART GOES OUT TO THESE FAMILIES WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THEM 
WE OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T GOT IT RIGHT WE NEED TO GET IT RIGHT NOW 
THESE ARE COMPLEX CASES ONE CASE VERY UNUSUAL MS. PETRIE'S CASE 
WHERE THE REPAIR WORKS ACTUALLY FAILED 
I CAN'T RECALL THAT EVER HAVING HAPPENED 
BUT WE DO COVER SEVENTEEN MILLION FAMILIES IN THE U. K. 
A SMALL PROPORTION DO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR NEW HOMES 
WE DEAL WITH THEM EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY THAT'S WHAT ALL THE RESEARCH TELLS US 
WE OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T GOT IT RIGHT IN THIS CASE 
IT'S MY PRIORITY TO MAKE SURE WE DO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS AN ACCEPTABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR CUSTOMERS TO WAIT TO HAVE THEIR HOMES REPAIRED 
ONCE SUBSIDENCE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED ONE YEAR TWO YEARS THREE YEARS 
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE AS LONG AS IT HAS IN THESE THREE CASES WHICH ARE COMPLEX AND UNUSUAL 
IN MS. PETRIE'S CASE THERE WERE SOME ISSUES WITH PARTY WALLS SOME HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES 
AND AS I SAID THE INITIAL REPAIR WORKS DIDN'T WORK 
ABSOLUTELY WHICH IS WHY IT'S TAKEN SO LONG AND THAT'S WHY WE NOW HAVE A TEAM TOGETHER 
BUT IT TOOK THREE YEARS TO GET YOU THROUGH THE DOOR TO MAKE THOSE CORRECTIONS TO REPAIR THE JOB 
YOU BOTCHED IT UP SHE'S NOW IN A HOME THAT'S UNMORTGAGEABLE 
ARE YOU GOING TO BUY IT BACK OFF HER IT'S VERY UNUSUAL FOR REPAIR WORKS TO FAIL 
THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW INSTANCES I CAN RECALL IT HAPPENING 
WE WILL DEFINITELY GO BACK IN WE NEED TO SORT OUT GET THE NEIGHBOURS TOGETHER AGREE PARTY WALL ISSUES 
WE'RE VERY READY TO MOVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WE'RE OUT OF TIME 
WHAT IS THE NHBC GUARANTEE FOR THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW 
TO GIVE THEM SATISFACTION REASSURANCE THAT WHEN THEIR HOMES HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WE WILL FIX IT 
HOPEFULLY THANK YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR E. MAILS AND LETTERS THIS WEEK 
AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF THEM ON THE FORD FOCUS 
WE SAID THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER ON MODELS FROM FOUR YEARS AGO OR EARLIER 
CAN SUDDENLY START BEHAVING ODDLY OR FAIL ALTOGETHER 
VERY SCARY IF YOU'RE ON THE ROAD WHEN IT HAPPENS 
IT CAN COST HUNDREDS OF POUNDS TO PUT RIGHT 
LAST WEEK FORD PROMISED ACTION ON THIS WHILE SAYING IT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY'D REALISED WAS A BIG PROBLEM 
THAT SURPRISED A LOT OF YOU MARGARET PLUMMER AND JOHN CHORLEY ARE AMONG MANY PEOPLE TO CONTACT US 
SAYING WHEN IT HAPPENED TO THEM THEIR LOCAL FORD DEALERS MADE CLEAR IT WAS A FAULT THEY'D SEEN BEFORE 
BRENDAN AND SUSAN O'HARA ARE PARTICULARLY UNLUCKY 
THEY HAVE TWO FOCUSES AND SAY IT'S HAPPENED IN BOTH OF THEM 
SHE NO LONGER TRUSTS WHAT HER DASHBOARD IS TELLING HER 
SUSAN MANUALLY WRITES DOWN HOW FAR SHE DRIVES SO SHE WON'T UNEXPECTEDLY RUN OUT OF PETROL 
FOR MANY OF YOU IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE PETROL GAUGE YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT IT'S THE SPEEDOMETER 
YORKSHIREMAN BERNARD SEELING'S SPEEDOMETER FAILED TWO YEARS AGO WHEN DRIVING TO THE LAKE DISTRICT 
WHEN HE RETURNED HE GOT IT FIXED AND THOUGHT THAT WAS THE END OF IT 
WHILE HE WAS ON HOLIDAY HE'D BEEN SNAPPED BY A MOBILE POLICE CAMERA DRIVING AT FORTY SEVEN M. P. H. IN A FORTY ZONE 
I'M NO BOY RACER 
BUT I CHALLENGE ANYBODY TO NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FORTY AND FORTY SEVEN 
WHEN YOU'VE NOT GOT THE INDICATOR WORKING FOR YOU 
BERNARD TOLD THE POLICE HIS SPEEDOMETER HAD BEEN ON THE BLINK 
BUT HE STILL GOT A SIXTY FINE AND THREE PENALTY POINTS ON HIS LICENCE 
IF HE'D KNOWN THE SAME FAULT WAS HAPPENING TO OTHERS HE'D HAVE PROTESTED MORE STRONGLY 
WHEN I ACTUALLY SAW IT ON WATCHDOG MY MIND SHOT BACK TWO YEARS AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF 
IF I'D KNOWN THAT AT THE TIME I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
I'M PRETTY BRASSED OFF BECAUSE I BOUGHT A CAR WHICH PROBABLY HAD A FAULT ON IT 
IT WAS A WIDESPREAD FAULT AND NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW ABOUT IT 
I GOT FINED SIXTY AND HAD THREE POINTS ON MY LICENCE IT NEEDN'T HAVE HAPPENED 
IT WASN'T MY FAULT 
A GREAT RESULT ON THIS FORD SAY THAT FOLLOWING OUR PROGRAMME LAST WEEK THEY'RE STILL INVESTIGATING 
BUT FROM TONIGHT THEY'RE OFFERING ALL FORD FOCUS DRIVERS WITH FAULTY INSTRUMENT CLUSTERS 
A REDUCED PRICE FOR REPAIR AT ANY FORD DEALERS 
THEY'LL REPLACE THE CLUSTER WITH THE LATEST VERSIONS IN STOCK FOR A FLAT FEE OF NINETY NINE 
IF YOU'VE ALREADY PAID TO HAVE IT FIXED AND THAT'S BEEN UP TO FIVE HUNDRED IN SOME CASES VERY GOOD NEWS 
FORD WILL REFUND YOU ANY AMOUNT YOU PAID OVER NINETY NINE 
GOOD STUFF IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT MORE 
THEY'VE SET UP A SPECIAL FREEPHONE CUSTOMER HOTLINE 
THAT NUMBER WILL ALSO BE ON OUR WEBSITE 
WE'VE HEARD OF PLENTY OF GOVERNMENT BODIES MAKING MISTAKES IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS 
WHEN THIS ONE GETS THINGS WRONG YOU COULD BE OUT OF A JOB 
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE A CRIMINAL CONVICTION IT STAYS ON YOUR RECORD FOREVER 
AND IF AN EMPLOYER WANTS TO FIND OUT IF YOU HAVE ONE 
THEY APPLY TO THE CRIMINAL RECORDS BUREAU THE C. R. B. 
LAST YEAR THE CRIMINAL RECORDS BUREAU CHECKED OUT THREE MILLION PEOPLE 
NOT BECAUSE THEY'D DONE ANYTHING WRONG BUT THEY'D APPLIED FOR A JOB WHERE IT'S VITAL YOU'VE NO RECORD 
IN MOST CASES IT'S A FORMALITY OR IT SHOULD BE 
HERE'S ANOTHER GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT WHERE THINGS DON'T ALWAYS GO AS SMOOTHLY AS THEY SHOULD 
AND THE CONSEQUENCES CAN BE DEVASTATING 
PIANO TEACHER PETE SHEATH GOT A COVETED JOB AS A MUSIC TEACHER AT A SCHOOL IN WATFORD LAST YEAR 
BECAUSE HE'D BE WORKING WITH KIDS HE NEEDED TO GET HIS CRIMINAL RECORD CHECKED BEFORE HE COULD START 
FINANCIALLY THE JOB WAS HUGE 
IT WAS THE KIND OF JOB YOU WORK UP TO AFTER SEVERAL YEARS TEACHING 
THE C. R. B. AIMS TO PROCESS CHECKS IN FOUR WEEKS 
BUT PETE'S STILL WASN'T BACK SIX WEEKS LATER 
DESPITE HAVING APPLIED THE MINUTE HE GOT THE JOB 
HE WASN'T ABLE TO START TEACHING AND THE TERM BEGAN WITHOUT HIM 
HE LOST MORE THAN HALF THE STUDENTS HE WAS DUE TO TUTOR 
WE LOST OVER FOUR THOUSAND THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 
THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR ANYBODY TO LOSE 
BUT FOR A NEWLY MARRIED COUPLE SAVING UP FOR A DEPOSIT FOR A HOUSE IT'S A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY 
PETE'S C. R. B. CHECK FINALLY ARRIVED CLEAN A WEEK LATER BUT TOO LATE FOR PETE 
HE'S COMPLAINED BUT THE C. R. B. HAVE BLAMED THE POLICE 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO PUT INTO WORDS REALLY 
THERE WAS SO MUCH EXPECTATION WE'D PUT ON THAT JOB AND TO LOSE THAT MUCH WAS DEVASTATING 
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE CRIMINAL RECORDS BUREAU TO BLAME DELAYS LIKE THIS ON THE LOCAL POLICE 
MAYBE THEY'RE RIGHT WE ALL KNOW THEY'RE BUSY 
BUT THE TIME IT TAKES SOME LOCAL FORCES TO DO THESE CHECKS WELL 
THAT REALLY IS CRIMINAL 
ACCORDING TO THE LATEST FIGURES TWO FORCES IN PARTICULAR 
HUMBERSIDE AND SUFFOLK ONLY PROCESSED A SHOCKING ONE PER CENT OF CHECKS IN TIME 
MERVYN BARRETT OF NACRO WHO ADVISE THE PUBLIC ON CRIMINAL RECORD CHECKS SAYS IT'S TAKING TOO LONG 
DELAYS IN THE PROCESSING OF CRIMINAL RECORDS ARE A PROBLEM 
AND THEY ARE A GROWING PROBLEM 
MOST CHECKS ARE STILL BEING DONE WITHIN FOUR WEEKS 
BUT LARGE NUMBERS OF CHECKS ARE TAKING SEVERAL MONTHS TO DO 
IN ODD CASES MORE THAN A YEAR 
THAT PROBLEM IS LIKELY TO INCREASE FURTHER IN THE FUTURE 
A LONG WAIT TO GET YOUR RECORDS IS ONE THING 
BUT IN SOME CASES GETTING THAT INFORMATION BACK IS WHEN YOUR PROBLEMS REALLY START 
ESPECIALLY IF THE CRIMINAL RECORDS BUREAU HAS IT ALL WRONG AND YOU'RE A VICTIM OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY 
RACHEL BUNKER WAS OFFERED A JOB AS A TEACHING ASSISTANT IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR 
WHEN HER C. R. B. CHECK CAME BACK 
SHE WAS HORRIFIED TO READ THAT SHE APPARENTLY HAD THREE CONVICTIONS FOR THEFT AND SHOPLIFTING 
I KNEW THAT I HADN'T HAD ANY CONVICTIONS BEFORE 
SO I PHONED THE C. R. B. PEOPLE IN LIVERPOOL AND QUESTIONED THIS 
BASICALLY THEY SAID WELL IT SOUNDS VERY LIKE YOU 
VERY SIMILAR SAME DATE OF BIRTH IT MUST BE YOU WE DON'T MAKE THESE ERRORS 
I SAID BUT IT'S NOT ME IT'S REALLY NOT ME 
THE CRIMES WERE CARRIED OUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO BY A WOMAN WITH A SIMILAR NAME 
BACK THEN RACHEL WAS USING A DIFFERENT NAME ALTOGETHER HER MAIDEN NAME 
DESPITE SENDING IN HER BIRTH AND MARRIAGE CERTIFICATES THE C. R. B. STILL HASN'T SORTED IT OUT 
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL KNEW HER THEY LET HER KEEP HER JOB 
BUT SHE'S STILL STRUGGLING TO FORMALLY CLEAR HER NAME 
I FELT CROSS THAT SOMEONE CAN MAKE A MISTAKE LIKE THIS WHEN THEIR JOB IS TO BE VERY VERY THOROUGH 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE MY IDENTITY'S BEEN STOLEN IN A WAY 
THEIR RECORDS NOW HAVE MY NAME WITH THESE CONVICTIONS ON 
THE CONVICTIONS ARE STILL THERE AND APPARENTLY IT'S STILL ME 
YOU'D HOPE THAT'S AS BAD AS IT GETS BUT NO 
IMAGINE YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD HAS THIRTY CONVICTIONS THAT ARE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU 
AND THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR YEARS 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO STUNTMAN JOHN STREET SEEN HERE IN ACTION 
WHEN HE HAD A CRIMINAL RECORD CHECK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HE GOT THE SHOCK OF HIS LIFE 
IT WAS TEN PAGES LONG DETAILING THIRTY OFFENCES NONE OF THEM HIS 
TELL US ABOUT THESE CONVICTIONS BE SPECIFIC 
EVERYTHING RANGING FROM THEFT BURGLARY 
VEHICLE THEFT 
HEROIN POSSESSION NICE 
FIGHTING WITH THE POLICE AFFRAY IT GOES ON 
WHAT ON EARTH WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND 
INITIALLY SHOCK AND DISBELIEF 
IT FOLLOWED A FEELING OF SICKNESS IN THE PIT OF MY STOMACH 
PHYSICAL SICKNESS YEAH I FELT PHYSICALLY SICK 
DO YOU THINK AT ANY STAGE THIS STOPPED YOU GETTING JOBS 
FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE I APPLIED FOR VARIOUS JOBS INCLUDING THE FIRE BRIGADE FOR FOUR YEARS ON THE TROT 
NEVER GOT A LOOK IN WHETHER IT'S ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT I COULDN'T SAY 
IT TOOK JOHN THREE MONTHS TO GET THE CONVICTIONS WIPED OFF 
THE C. R. B. AGREED TO GIVE JOHN NINE HUNDRED FOR THE TIME AND HASSLE TAKEN TO RECTIFY IT 
BUT FOR HIM IT'S LITTLE CONSOLATION 
STILL DISBELIEF TO THIS DAY REALLY THAT AN ERROR LIKE THAT CAN BE MADE 
I WAS VERY ANGRY AT THAT TIME AND I STILL AM TO THIS DAY TO BE HONEST 
I DON'T FEEL THAT JUSTICE HAS BEEN DONE 
CHECKS LIKE THESE ARE CRUCIAL 
WE'RE ALL SAFER BECAUSE OF THEM BUT ONLY WHEN THE RECORDS ARE RIGHT 
NO ONE DESERVES TO BE BRANDED A CRIMINAL WHEN THEY'VE DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG 
VINCE GASKELL IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE C. R. B. 
IT'S DISTURBING ISN'T IT 
LET ME SAY THAT HAVING WATCHED THOSE THREE CLIPS 
I DO UNDERSTAND HOW STRESSFUL AND DISTRESSING IT MUST HAVE BEEN 
FOR THOSE THREE PEOPLE 
I REALLY DO APOLOGISE TO THEM FOR WHAT THEY'VE HAD TO EXPERIENCE 
BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT IF I CAN 
PARTICULARLY FOR THE SECOND TWO RACHEL AND PETE THAT YOU INTERVIEWED 
OUR SERVICE IS EXCEPTIONALLY ACCURATE 
NINETY NINE POINT NINE PER CENT OF THE CHECKS WE ISSUE ARE ACCURATE 
THESE SITUATIONS ARE EXCEPTIONALLY RARE 
I KNOW YOU HAVE TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION WE UNDERSTAND THAT 
YOU DO GOOD WORK AND IT'S PROPER THAT WE EMPHASIZE THAT 
BUT RACHEL BUNKER WRONG FIRST NAME 
WRONG MIDDLE NAME WRONG SURNAME VINCE THAT'S ERRING ON THE SIDE OF INCOMPETENCE ISN'T IT 
I DON'T ACCEPT THAT I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL CASE IF YOU DON'T MIND 
BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THERE ARE INSTANCES IN WHICH THERE'S AN EXCEPTIONALLY CLOSE MATCH 
BETWEEN THE DETAILS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL PROVIDES TO US 
WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG WITH PETE SHEATH 
WHY ARE NACRO SAYING THAT DELAYS ARE INCREASING 
HE LOST A LOT OF MONEY AND REALLY IS AN APOLOGY ENOUGH 
LET ME DEAL WITH THE RACHEL QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED ME 
THE DETAILS CAN BE EXCEPTIONALLY CLOSE 
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT SITUATION THE CONSEQUENCES OF GETTING THAT WRONG CAN BE CATASTROPHIC 
IN TERMS OF PUBLIC PROTECTION 
THAT IS WHY MY STAFF DO THE JOB EXCEPTIONALLY WELL AND ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION I APPRECIATE THAT 
A FINAL POINT IT WAS CATASTROPHIC FOR JOHN STREET WASN'T IT 
IN THE CASE OF JOHN STREET THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING CASE 
I WELL UNDERSTAND THE DISTRESS FOR HIM 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TIME HE'D HAVE COME ACROSS A SITUATION 
WHERE SOMEONE ELSE HAS USED HIS INFORMATION WHEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE
