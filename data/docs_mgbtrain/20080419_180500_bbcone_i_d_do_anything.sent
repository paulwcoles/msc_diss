AND MY HEART WILL GO ON AND ON 
OF ALL OUR NANCYS YOU HAVE HAD A 
REALLY DIFFICULT JOURNEY BUT YOU 
ARE SURVIVOR YOU ARE DO YOU 
THINK YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH TONIGHT 
TO AVOID THE SING OFF 
I HOPE 
SO 
TO AVOID THE SING OFF I HOPE SO I MEAN IT HAS BEEN AN EMOTIONAL TOUGH WEEK FOR 
ME BUT 
I'M 
FIGHTER AND I REALLY WANT TO BE 
HERE NEXT 
WEEK BASICALLY 
I'M JUST 
GOING TO 
GIVE IT 
MY ALL IF I AM IN 
THE SING OFF 
BRACE YOURSELF I'M 
GOING TO THE PANEL NOW 
HAS SHE DONE ENOUGH TO STAY OUT OF 
THE SING OFF LET'S START WITH 
DENISE LAST WEEK YOU SAID SHE 
WASN'T NANCY 
I KNOW FOR YOU THIS 
HAS BEEN TOUGH THE LAST COUPLE 
WEEKS I COULD SEE YOU CAME OUT 
FIGHTING TODAY HOWEVER I'M STILL 
A LITTLE CONCERNED I STILL FEEL 
YOU DON'T CONNECT WITH THE WORDS 
JUST LISTEN TO ME THERE IS A 
DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU'RE GIVEN A 
REALLY HEART 
FELT SONG IN THE WAY 
YOU PERFORMED THAT TO THE WAY 
SAMANTHA PERFORMED HER SONG THERE 
IS MORE RAW EMOTION 
WHAT WOULD YOU 
LIKE ME TO DO 
I HOPE IT IS ENOUGH 
AND THE VIEWERS DECIDE 
IT IS 
ENOUGH 
I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THIS 
GO ON THEN 
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT 
KEISHA YOU WERE THERE EMOTIONALLY 
TONIGHT AND IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT 
EMOTIONAL PERFORMANCE THAN YOU HAVE 
GIVEN BEFORE AT 
THE BEGINNING 
THERE WAS 
A LITTLE FLAT IN THE 
VOICE AND A CRACK 
IN THE 
THERE AT THE BIG 
BITS YOU 
SELL IT 
THAT WAS 
THE BEST 
YOU HAVE DONE SO 
FAR FOR ME 
I DO 
THINK 
THAT IS 
THE 
FAR FOR ME BEST PERFORMANCE 
YOU HAVE 
GIVEN 
BUT FOR 
SOME REASON 
I JUST 
BELIEVE 
WHAT YOU'RE 
SINGING THAT 
IS 
WHAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MIXES MIXES COMMENTS BARRY SHE'S UET HERE 
FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL SHE'S OUT 
HERE FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL WHAT DO 
YOU SAY 
I THINK IT WAS A WARM AND 
POWERFUL PERFORMANCE L. HAVE BEEN 
SURE OF 
YOU 
BEFORE YOU 
DELIVERED 
THE SONG 
AND I 
FELT YOU 
LIVED THE SONG 
IT'S TIME TO GO TO THE MAN WHO 
SAVED HER OVER IN VEGAS DO YOU 
STANDBY YOUR DECISION ANDREW I I TOTALLY DO I'M VERY PROUD TONIGHT 
THAT SHE CAME THROUGH AS WELL AS 
SHE DID THAT WAS A VERY VERY GOOD 
PERFORMANCE I UNDERSTAND WHAT 
DENISE IS TALKING ABOUT I THINK 
THERE ARE SOME VALID POINTS THERE 
SOMETHING I HAVE TO THINK MYSELF 
OLIVER IS NOT MY MUSICAL IT IS NOT 
MY PRODUCTION THEREFORE I HAVE TO 
TRY AND IMAGINE WHAT CAMERON 
MACKINTOSH WOULD REALLY WANT IN THE 
SHOW I HAVE A FEELING KNOWING 
CAMERON AS I DO THAT 
HE WOULD 
AGREE WITH ME THAT THERE IS 
SOMETHING WITHIN YOU 
THAT WE 
TRY 
AND PROVE 
BEFORE THIS PROGRAMME 
IS THROUGH 
THANK YOU 
BUT ANOTHER NANCY MUST GO HOME IF 
YOU WANT TO KEEP KEISHA OUT OF 
DANGER YOU MUST VOTE THIS IS THE 
NUMBER FOR LATER 
DON'T VOTE NOW VOTE WHEN THE LINES 
OPEN AT THE END OF THE SHOW 
TIME FOR OUR NEXT TWO NANCYS 
COUNTY KERRY'S JESSIE BUCKLEY AND 
CARDIFF'S SARAH LARK 
STKPHIE 
THAT TO ME WAS THE STKPHIE PERFORMANCE OF THE NIGHT 
IT IS 
OVERWHELMING TO GET COMMENTS LIKE 
THAT YOU ARE A STAR 
I JUST 
COME THAT YOU ARE A STAR I JUST COME FROM SUCH SMALL TOWN TO SOMEONE SO 
BIG AS 
ANDREW LLOYD 
WEBBER TO 
SAY JESSIE BUCKLEY YOU'RE 
A STAR 
JESSIE HAS NO CONCEPT OF HOW BIG IT 
IS AT HOME NOTHING AS BIG AS THIS 
HAS HAPPENED IN 
HER TOWN 
HAS HAPPENED IN HER TOWN THE WHOLE SCHOOL AND TOWN ARE SUPPORTING 
JESSIE JESSIE IT'S HARD TO 
BELIEVE IT 
IS OUR 
SISTER WE'RE SO PROUD OF HER 
WE CALL HER THE SINGING MONSTER 
THE MINUTE SHE STEPS IN THE DOOR IT 
IS JUST SINGING WE REALLY MISS 
JESSIE THE SONG IS SO QUIET 
WITHOUT HER WE HOPE JESSIE WILL 
COME BACK AS NANCY 
I CLOSED MY EYES AND I HEARD THE 
VOICE OF NANCY BUT WHEN I OPENED 
MY EYES ONE DIDN'T STILL QUITE SEE 
NANCY NANCY I THINK THEY ONLY SEE THE BLONDE
