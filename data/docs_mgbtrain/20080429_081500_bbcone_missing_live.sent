GILL WHITHLY KNOWS WHAT IT IS LIKE 
TO REUNITE FAMILIES SHE HAS OVER 
THREE THOUSAND CASES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST 
CONTACT AND WANTING HER HELP GOOD 
MORNING TO YOU MORNING 
AND THIS MORNING STARTED BECAUSE YOUR HUSBAND WANTED 
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIS FAMILY 
WHAT HAPPENED THERE 
HE HADN'T SEEN 
HIS MUM FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND THEN 
DECIDED HE WANTED TO SEE HER HE 
REMEMBERED SHE HAD BEEN IN BRADFORD 
FOR MANY YEARS SO I CONTACTED THE 
LOCAL NEWSPAPER AND SHE GOT IN 
TOUCH THAT EVENING 
HOW AMAZING 
WHAT DIFFERENCE DID THAT MAKE TO 
YOUR HUSBAND 
OH AN IMMENSE 
DIFFERENCE SADLY SHE PASSED AWAY 
JUST A YEAR LATER BUT AT LEAST SHE 
PASSED AWAY IN OUR HOME 
AND HOW 
MUCH DIFFERENCE DID IT MAKE TO HER 
THAT YOU WENT OUT AND FOUND HER OH OH SHE WAS OVERWHELMED SHE WAS ONE 
LOVELY LADY AND IT MADE A HUGE 
DIFFERENCE TO JOHN BECAUSE HE 
FOUND OUT A LOT OF TRUTH S. FROM HIS 
MUM HE'D BEEN TOLD A LOT OF LIES 
AND HOW YOU ARE HELPING OTHER 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST CONTACT HOW 
DO YOU START 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED 
IT'S IN MEMORY OF HIS MUM WHEN I 
FIRST STARTED I WAS WORKING BLIND 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ON EARTH I WAS 
DOING AND GRADUALLY OVER THE 
YEARS I'VE TAUGHT MYSELF DIFFERENT 
METHODS AND WAYS AND HOW TO SEARCH 
THE RECORDS AND IT HAS JUST 
SPIRALLED FROM THE START 
AND NOW 
YOU PUT PEOPLE IN TOUCH WITH EACH 
OTHER 
YES I'VE BEEN DOING THAT OTHER FOR THE PAST TWELVE YEARS 
HOW TRICKY 
IS IT ARE THERE SOME PEOPLE WHO 
DON'T WANT TO BE PUT IN TOUCH 
THERE ARE SOME I'LL CONTACT THE 
PERSON FIRST WHEN I FIND THEM AND 
IF THEY DO NOT WANT TO HAVE CONTACT 
WITH THE PERSON SEEKING THEM THAT 
IT IS END OF STORY BUT I FIND THE 
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE FRIENDS 
SIBLINGS BIRTH MUMS ANY SCENARIO 
MOST OF THEM ARE REALLY HAPPY TO BE 
FOUND FOUND YOU MENTIONED BIRTH MUMS IS THAT 
TRICKY AS WELL IF THEY WANT TO 
FIND A CHILD THEY HAD TO GIVE UP 
BIRTH MUMS THEMSELVESFIED IT LOT 
MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE ALL THE 
RIGHTS ARE ON THE CHILD'S SIDE 
ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN ADOPTED NOW HAS 
THE RIGHTS TO FIND THEIR ROOTS BUT 
BIRTH MUMS WHEN THEY SIGN THEIR 
CHILD AWAY THEY ARE EXPECTED NEVER 
TO SEE THEM AGAIN SO THEY CANNOT 
GET ACCESS TO RECORDS WHEREAS THE 
CHILDREN CAN 
SO IF PEOPLE WANT TO GET IN TOUCH 
WITH PEOPLE AGAIN HOW DO THEY DO 
IT GET IN CONTACT WITH YOU THEY THEY CAN GET IN CONTACT WITH ME OR 
OTHER ORGANISATIONS BUT THEY HAVE 
TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS THEY 
CAN IN THE CASE OF FIND AGO BIRTH 
MUM I SUGGEST THEY GET ACCESS TO 
THEIR ORIGINAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE 
BUT GET FACTS FULL NAME DATE OF 
BIRTH BECAUSE THEY NEED THAT 
INFORMATION TO ENABLE THEM TO LOOK 
THROUGH THE RECORDS 
AND OVER THE 
YEARS HAVE YOU SEEN IT MAKES A 
DIFFERENCE TO PEOPLE'S LIVES BEING 
IN CONTACT 
IT CAN TURN LIVES 
AROUND COMPLETELY FROM ONE THING 
RIGHT TO ANOTHER 
OH THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH GILL FOR COMING TO TALK 
TO US HERE AND ONE OF GILL'S CASE 
A DAUGHTER AND A MOTHER WHO GOT IN 
TOUCH AGAIN WILL BE WITH US HERE 
LATER LATER AS WE SAW EARLIER LIZ KERSHAW IS

DISAPPEARED SHE HAS BECOME A 
GRANDMOTHER AND DOESN'T KNOW IT YET 
SIXTY FOUR YEAR OLD LIZ KERSHAW HAS THREE

ROME WHICH WE'D BOOKED AND IT WAS 
A LOVELY TIME AND AT ONE POINT IN 
ROME SHE COULDN'T EAT HER DINNER 
AND SHE SAID I FEEL REALLY SICK 
AND SHE LOOKED REALLY LOW AND I 
SAID HAVE THE HEADACHES COME 
BACK AND SHE TOLD ME THEY HAD 
COME BACK AND THAT REALLY CRUSHED 
HER 
IT KNOCKED HER FOR SIX IT WAS HER LIRKS WHAT HAS HAPPENED WHAT HAVE 
I DONE AND I THINK HER REACTION 
WAS THE WORST SHE WAS DESPARATE TO 
GET BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL SHE 
THOUGHT THAT WOULD SOLVE THINGS IN IN MAY TWO THOUSAND FIVE LIZ IS COMMITTED TO A 
PSYCHIATRIC UNIT IN A HOSPITAL IN 
WARRINGTON 
SHE WAS REALLY WORKED WARRINGTON UP MORE THAN THE FIRST TIME 
BECAUSE IT HAD COME BACK AND SHE 
COULDN'T SEE AN END TO IT

HAPPENED AND THEY SAID SHE HAD 
NOT BEEN SEEN IN THE HOSPITAL SINCE 
ONE O'CLOCK 
SHE WAS DUE TO GO TO

ACROSS THE CORRIDOR BUT SHE CHOSE 
THAT MOMENT TO GO 
REALISING LIZ ISN'T THERE THEY TRY 
TO CONTACT HER 
THE HOSPITAL PHONED MY MUM'S HOME

THE HOSPITAL TAKING INTO ACCOUNT 
HER MENTAL STATE SHE WAS GRADED AT 
THAT TIME AS HIGH RISK 
A TEAM OF POLICE GO TO THE HOSPITAL 
TO SEARCH THE GROUNDS BUT THERE IS 
NO SIGN OF LIZ THEN IT IS 
DISCOVERED THAT HER MOBILE PHONE IS

IT WITH HER IT IS POSSIBLE THEY CAN 
TRACE HER THROUGH HER CALLS WE WE CONTACT HER PHONE COMPANY AND THEN 
WE CAN PINPOINT POTENTIALLY WHERE 
THAT PERSON IS SO WE LIAISED WITH 
THE PHONE COMPANY AND IT WAS 
POSSIBLE THAT MRS. KERSHAW WAS IN 
THE WHARF STREET AREA OFFICERS OFFICERS RUSH THERE AS IT IS ONLY A MILE 
FROM THE HOSPITAL BUT THEY CANNOT 
FIND LIZ 
THIS IS THE AREA WHERE 
MRS. KERSHAW'S MOBILE PHONE WAS

THE WORD BOXING WHAT STEMMED FROM 
THAT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THAT HE 
HAS USED THE WORD ARMY IS THAT IN 
RELATION TO HAS HE BEEN IN THE 
ARMY OR IS HE CONNECTING THAT WITH 
RECENT T. V. PROGRAMMES HE IS WATCHING 
EIGHT WEEK UNTIL SOMEONE 
RECOGNISES HIM OR IF HE CAN 
REMEMBER SOMETHING FROM HIS OWN 
PAST HIS CARERS HAVE GIVEN HIM A 
TEMPORARY IDENTITY 
HE HAS BEEN 
GIVEN A NAME HE HAS BEEN GIVEN A 
DATE OF BIRTH HE HAS BEEN KNOWN AS 
DAVID FOR NEARLY EIGHT YEARS NOW 
THEY ESTIMATE HE IS ROUND SEVENTY BUT 
THEY WOULD MUCH PREFER TO FIND OUT 
THE REAL FACTS ABOUT HIS LIFE IF IF WE COULD FIND AND DISCOVER HIS TRUE 
IDENTITY THAT COULD ONLY ENHANCE 
HIS QUALITY OF LIFE AND TO ACTUALLY 
ENABLE HIM TO FIND OUT WHO HE IS 
SINCE THAT FILM WENT OUT WE HAVE 
HAD A NUMBER OF CALLS WHAT IS THE 
LATEST ON THAT CASE 
WE HAVE HAD 
OVERWELL MING RESPONSE A LOT OF 
CALLS REGARDING DAVID HARRISON A 
LOT OF PEOPLE THINKING HE MIGHT BE 
A RELATIVE OR THEY RECOGNISE HIM 
SO OBVIOUSLY THE POLICE AND SOCIAL 
SERVICES ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO 
FOLLOW THOSE UP FOCUSING ON A FEW 
OF THOSE IN PARTICULAR I I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE GOING FAR AWAY 
SOME OF THESE AS FAR AWAY AS 
CANADA 
WE HAVE HAD ALL SORTS SO IT CANADA IS GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF TIME BUT 
THEY ARE USEFUL WE ARE LOOKING AT 
A FEW DIFFERENT NAMES FINGERS FINGERS CROSSED WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHO HE 
S. DAVID'S STORY IS UNUSUAL BUT MOST 
OF THE UNIDENTIFIED CASES MISTING 
PEOPLE MISSING PEOPLE DEAL WITH 
ARE NO LONGER ALIVE THIS IS 
FASCINATING IF A BODY IS FOUND 
AND NO ONE KNOWS WHO IT S. WHAT IS 
IT YOU CAN DO 
THE ANTHROPOLOGIST 
CAN CREATE A PROFILE OF THAT PERSON 
LOOKING AT THE SKELETON AND THE 
BONES AND TRYING TO WORK OUT WHO 
THEY WERE THEIR SEX AGE HEIGHT 
WHETHER THEY HAD ANY MAJOR 
ILLNESSES OR TRAUMAS 
SO JUST FROM 
BONE YOUSHES CAN FIND OUT THAT MUCH 
INFORMATION 
ABSOLUTELY WE THINK OF INFORMATION THE SKELETON AS BEING HARD AND 
SOLID BUT IT IS CHANGEABLE AND IT 
CHANGES DEPENDING ON YOUR SEX HOW 
YOU GROW EVERYTHING YOU DO EVEN 
WHAT YOU EAT AND DRINK ALL WE DO 
IS LOOK AT THAT AND TRY AND FIGURE 
OUT A BIT ABOUT THAT PERSON YOU YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF BONE WHICH ARE 
THE BEST FOR YOU TO DO YOUR WORK 
FROM 
WE CAN USE PRETTY MUCH ALL OF FROM THEM BUT THE HEAD IS THE BEST AND 
THE PELVIS THAT IS BEST FOR AGEING 
AND WORK OUT THE SEX AS WELL THAT THAT IS FANTASTIC SO IF YOU HAVE GOT 
YOU HAVE SOME INFORMATION YOU HAVE 
GATHERED FROM THE BONE WHAT IS THE 
NEXT STEP FOR YOU TO IDENTIFY WHO 
THIS PERSON COULD HAVE BEEN WE WE GIVE THE INFORMATION ON TO SOMEONE 
ELSE AND THEY CAN TAKE IT FURTHER 
ONE OF THE PEOPLE WE CAN PASS IT ON 
TO WOULD BE A FORENSIC ARTIST SUCH SUCH AS TERI WHAT HAPPENS THEN 
ONCE WE 
HAVE GOT A GOOD DESCRIPTION WE CAN 
USE THAT IN PUBLICITY WE TRY AND DO 
BUT ALSO WE CAN DO SOME FORENSIC 
ART AND IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WE 
CAN DO FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION LIKE 
THIS ONE FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS STILL 
A MAN WHO IS STILL UNIDENTIFIED 
BUT WHAT WE DO IS TAKE THE SKULL 
AND USE THE SKULL AS THE FOUNDATION 
OF THE FACE AND BUILD UP THE FACE 
FROM THE SKULL USING THE MUSCLE 
GROUPS AND SO ON TO CREATE AN IMAGE 
OF WHAT THAT PERSON MIGHT LOOK LIKE 
THIS IS REAL CASE THAT YOU ARE 
WORKING ON THIS MODEL YOU HAVE GOT 
HERE 
THIS MAN WAS FOUND IN HERE NORTHAMPTONSHIRE IN TWO THOUSAND TWO MORE 
INFORMATION IS KNOWN ABOUT HIM WE 
DO HAVE A BIT OF INFORMATION 
ABILITY HIS HAIR BECAUSE OF THE 
WAY HE WAS FOUND WE KNOW TINY 
DETAIL HE HAS TWO EAR PIERCINGS IN 
ONE EAR HE WAS FOUND WITH A 
SLEEPING BAG 
WAS THERE A RUCKSACK 
POSSESSIONS NEARBY SEEM TO LINK TO 
HIM HE MAY HAVE BEEN LIVING ROUGH 
BUT THE RUCKSACK AGAIN MIGHT BE 
RECOGNISABLE AS WELL AS HIS FACE 
SO I MEAN I GUESS IT IS WORTH 
SAYING THIS IS A REAL MODEL YOU 
HAVE MADE UP IF THERE IS ANYONE 
THAT RECOGNISING WHO THAT IS THAT 
IS WHAT WE ARE DOING WE WANT TO 
FIND OUT WHO THIS PERSON COULD HAVE 
BEEN AND THIS IS A WAY OF DOING IT 
WE URGE THOSE PEOPLE TO CONTACT US 
TODAY 
IF ANYONE RECOGNISING THAT TODAY PERSON OR THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND 
TIMINGS SOUND FAMILIAR THE SAME WE 
WOULD LIKE WITH ALL OUR CASES

UNEASIER IDENTIFIED CASES BUT WE 
GET ROUND SEVENTY REPORTED TO US EACH 
YEAR BUT ROUND SEVENTY FIVE PRERS IDENTIFIED
