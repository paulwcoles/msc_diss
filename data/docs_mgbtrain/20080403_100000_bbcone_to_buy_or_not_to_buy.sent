YOU THINK THE PROPERTY IS WORTH 
WHETHER IT IS NOBLER TO SUFFER THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS PROPERTY FORTUNE 
TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY IS STILL THE DEFINITIVE QUESTION 
TIS A GREAT QUESTION SQUIRE DIGBY AND ONE THAT WILL BE VERILY ANSWERED 
IN ABOUT FORTY TWO AND A HALF MINUTES STARTING FROM NOW 
IF SHROPSHIRE WAS A BELT THEN SHREWSBURY OR SHROWSBURY WOULD BE ITS SHINY BELT BUCKLE 
INDEED SO BRIGHT AND SHINY REALLY IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT 
WE'VE BEEN SENT HERE TO FIND A SELECTION OF SWELL PROPERTIES 
SWELL PROPERTIES LIKE A MEDIEAVAL CASTLE I'D LOVE A JOUST NOW GET ON A HORSE AND O. I. 
ED SOMETIMES YOU ARE SO NEATHANDERTHOLIC AND I CONSIDER 
OURSELVES TO BE COMPLETE OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE EVOLUTIONARY SCALE 
INTERESTING BECAUSE WE CAN TEST THAT THEORY OUT RIGHT HERE 
BECAUSE SHREWSBURY OR SHROWSBURY IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF CHARLES DARWIN 
WOO THE GODFATHER OF EVOLUTION 
YES SNAKE HIPS HIMSELF CHARLES DARWIN 
DID YOU KNOW THAT ONCE WE'VE FOUND THE THREE PROPERTIES WE'LL GIVE OUR 
HOUSE HUNTERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PERUSE THEIR FAVOURITE 
I DID KNOW THAT CHRISTIAN 
BUT SURELY YOU MEANT TO SAY TRY BEFORE THEY BUY 
OF COURSE I KNEW THAT 
AND TODAY'S HOUSE HUNTERS KNOW THAT TOO 
HERE THEY ARE ANDREW AND VICKY WHO'S UNION IS A LOVE STORY FOR THE MILLENNIUM GENERATION 
YES THEY MET VIA AN INTERNET DATING AGENCY ONE BLIND DATE AND THIRTEEN MONTHS 
LATER THEY'RE TAKING THE PLUNGE AND BUYING THEIR FIRST HOME TOGETHER 
MEDICAL REP VICKY SHE SPENDS HER DAYS ON THE ROAD WHEREAS ANDREW'S WORK AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT 
HAS PROMPTED THEIR RELOCATION FROM MANCHESTER TO SHREWSBURY 
AND IF A ROLLING STONE GATHERS NO MOSS THEN OUR UBER TRAVELLED 
COUPLE ARE READY TO GET SMOTHERED IN MOSS LAY DOWN SOME ROOTS AND BUY A HOUSE THAT THEY CAN CALL HOME 
ANDREW AND VICKY WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS TODAY 
THE OPTIONS ARE WE STAY HERE WE DRINK MULLED WINE 
AND WE DO GHOST STORIES OR OPTION TWO YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS 
WE GO HOUSE HUNTING YES 
YES LET'S GO FOR OPTION TWO 
IT'S A VERY DULL SHOW FORTY FIVE MINUTES DRINK MULLED WINE 
YOU DON'T LIVE HERE IN SHREWSBURY DO YOU 
WE LIVE IN MANCHESTER BUT WE'RE LOOKING TO RELOCATE TO SHREWSBURY 
YOU HAVE AN OFFICE HERE YES MY COMPANY HAS OFFICES 
IN MANCHESTER AND SHREWSBURY SO I CAN WORK OUT OF EITHER 
WHAT'S THE DREAM FOR YOU 
WE WANT A PROPERTY WITH CHARACTER AN OLD PROPERTY A NEW BUILD WE WOULDN'T WANT 
SO ACTUALLY SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU COULD SIT DRINK MULLED WINE AND TELL GHOST STORIES 
EXACTLY I'VE HEARD THERE'S ONE MASSIVE PROBLEM WITH THIS DEAL 
AND IT'S A PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE IN THE BEDROOM DEPARTMENT 
THE PROBLEM IN THE BEDROOM DEPARTMENT IS OUR MASSIVE BED 
YOU HAVE A MASSIVE BED 
HOW BIG IS THE BED BECAUSE SURELY IT ONLY GOES DIVAN QUEEN SIZE AND KING SIZE HOW BIG IS IT 
SUPER SUPER YOU GET A SUPER IT'S A KING SIZE 
IT'S NOT A SUPER KING SIZE BUT IT'S RUSTIC PLANK THE WOOD IS VERY BIG 
AND THEN IT'S THE TWO 
THE TWO BEDSIDES EITHER SIDE AGAIN IN THAT KIND OF CHUNKY WOOD THEY'RE ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF EITHER SIDE 
AND YOU COULDN'T COMPROMISE ON THE BEDSIDE CABINETS NO 
IT'S A FAIR POINT THEN 
O. K. LOVELY BED TO ONE SIDE WHAT ELSE MUST THIS HOUSE HAVE IN TERMS 
OF ACCOMMODATION ROOMS ATTICS LOUNGES ENTERTAINING SPACE 
WHAT DO YOU WANT TELL ME 
THREE BEDROOMS AND PREFERABLY WITH A STUDY AREA BECAUSE VICKY WILL BE WORKING FROM HOME 
PERIOD HOMES YOU WANT YES YES SOMETHING OLDE WORLDLY 
DO YOU WANT TO DO DIY 
WE DON'T WANT TO RIP OUT KITCHENS 
AND KNOCK DOWN WALLS AND ALL THAT 
YOU'RE REALLY ONLY TALKING ABOUT HANGING A PICTURE AREN'T YOU 
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT BE HONEST 
I'M GOING TO ASK TWO QUESTIONS O. K. GO ON THEN GARDEN 
CAR PARKING SPACE THEY'RE TEDIOUS QUESTIONS BUT IMPORTANT 
GARDEN GARDEN 
YOU NEED ONE YES 
A PARKING SPACE WOULD BE NICE 
IT'S ONTO THE BIG QUESTION O. K. WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET 
TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
THAT'S A LOVELY AMOUNT OF MONEY WE CAN DO SOMETHING WITH THAT 
SEE YOU LATER NOW LISTEN I CAN STAY HERE WE CAN DO THE MULLED WINE AND THE GHOST STORIES 
THE RED WINE SOUNDS GOOD GHOST STORIES NO 
I'LL SEE YOU LATER 
EDDIEPOOS I'M FEELING LIKE AN OPTIMIST AND A PESSIMIST ALL AT ONCE 
THAT'S A BIT WEIRD WHY 
I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FACT THEY WANT OLD HOUSES IN SHREWSBURY 
SHREWSBURY'S ONLY GOT OLD HOUSES 
I'M A PESSIMIST BECAUSE OLD HOUSES TEND TO BE SMALL 
AND THEREFORE SMALLER BEDROOMS 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HELP THEM OUT IN THE OLD BEDROOM DEPARTMENT 
THAT BIG BED THERE'S ONE WAY TO SOLVE THIS 
I WANT TO TALK TO AN ESTATE AGENT ALL RIGHT 
I'LL SEE YOU LATER I'M GOING TO EXPLORE THE LOCAL AREA 
AND WHAT AN AREA THIS IS 
NESTLED IN AN IDYLLIC SPUR OF THE RIVER SEVERN WHICH CIRCLES THE TOWN LIKE A MOAT 
SHREWBURY'S RECORDS DATE BACK TO THE SEVENTH CENTURY 
AND THE TOWN STILL RETAINS ITS MEDIAEVAL STREET PLAN TODAY 
AND FOUNDED IN ONE THOUSAND SEVENTY FOUR SHREWSBURY CASTLE STILL STANDS PROUD 
AND WONDERFULLY HIGHLIGHTS THE HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF THE TOWN 
OVER THE YEARS SHREWSBURY HAS PROVEN TO BE SUCH 
A DESIRABLE DESTINATION THAT EVEN MICHAEL PALIN INCLUDED THE TOWN 
IN THE TRAVEL OF HIS EARLY YEARS WHEN HE ATTENDED THE LOCAL GRAMMAR SCHOOL 
BUT CHARLES DARWIN IS THE MAN WHO REMAINS SHREWSBURY'S MOST 
ILLUSTRIOUS HISTORICAL OFFSPRING AND HIS ORIGIN OF OUR SPECIES 
COULD SPEAK VOLUMES ABOUT THESE HERE SALOPIANS AND THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT 
VERY TRUE AND PERHAPS WHEN HE WAS TAKING TIME OUT FROM 
HIS GLOBAL VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY DARWIN IMMERSED HIMSELF IN DISCUSSION OF THE REGION'S FLOWERS 
AS SHREWSBURY IS A BLOSSOMING FLORAL TOWN AND FOLLOWS THE MANTRA OF ITS COAT OF ARMS FLOREAT SOLOPIA 
MAY SHREWSBURY FLOURISH AND IT CERTAINLY DOES HOSTING A LONG RUNNING ESTEEMED 
ANNUAL FLOWER SHOW SO THIS SHROPSHIRE OASIS IS BLOOMING WITH A PROUD 
HISTORY AND PROSPERITY BUT HOW FAR WOULD VICKY AND ANDREW'S TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND STRETCH ELSEWHERE IN OUR LAND 
WELL IN LANCASHIRE THEY'D CERTAINLY GET VALUE FOR MONEY 
A DETACHED PERIOD PROPERTY PACKED WITH ORIGINAL FEATURES AND A VERY LARGE GARDEN 
THERE'S THREE BEDROOMS AND TWO RECEPTION ROOMS 
I WOULD SAY A STEAL AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING CHARACTER THEN FEAST YOUR EYES ON THIS BEAUTY A DELIGHTFUL STONE 
COTTAGE IN THE PENNINE VILLAGE OF UPPERMILL ONLY TWO BEDROOMS BUT IT OFFERS IMMENSE CHARM 
IN A LOVELY HAMLET BLESSED WITH STUNNING VISTAS OF COUNTRYSIDE GALORE 
COTTAGES ARE US FOR TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
BUT FINALLY THERE'S THIS CHARMING TWO BED VICTORIAN PROPERTY IN BURY SAINT EDMUNDS 
IT RETAINS ALL OF THE ORIGINAL TRAITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ERA 
FINE PERIOD FIREPLACES POLISHED WOODEN FLOORING AND PANELLED INTERIOR DOORS 
IF VICKY AND ANDREW WERE INTERESTED THEY'D STILL HAVE MONEY TO TRAVEL 
THE WORLD WITH AS THIS LOVELY HOME IS ON THE MARKET ONLY 
FOR TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
BUT THEY'VE SAID THEY WANT TO SETTLE DOWN SO WHAT'S ON OFFER IN SHREWSBURY 
LADIES ARE YOU SALOPIANS WE ARE YES

SMELLS LIKE A HISTORY LESSON 
O. K. LET'S HAVE A LOOK IN THE SITTING ROOM THIS IS THE SITTING ROOM QUITE A NICE SIZE 
NOT A BAD SIZE A GOOD ROOM YEAH HIGH CEILINGS 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE FIREPLACE AT LEAST THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOVELY 
FIREPLACE THERE ONCE AND NOW THEY'VE GOT A GAS ONE IN BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I DON'T LIKE IT CHRISTIAN 
PEOPLE FORGET THAT WE CAN HEAR THEM IN THE BACK GARDEN DON'T THEY 
MANY PEOPLE FEEL THAT WE CAN'T HEAR THEM AND THIS IS T. V. TRICKERY 
BUT IT'S NOT I TELL YOU WHAT 
THERE IS AN AERIAL JUST ABOUT THERE DON'T UNPLUG IT THOUGH

THIS IS NICE IT'S NICE AND LIGHT 
IT DOES GET A LOT OF LIGHT THROUGH THAT WINDOW 
IT'S LIGHT THAT'S A PLUS YEAH 
THEY'RE LOVING THAT A LOVELY SPACE FOR ENTERTAINING 
THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY WORKED ON THIS AND THEY'VE PUT DOWN NEW FLOORING WHICH IS O. K. 
NICE YEAH DECORATED NICELY IT'S A GOOD SIZE 
THERE'S THE KITCHEN SO YOU KNOW YOU COULD COME AND HAVE YOUR MEALS HERE 
WOW NOW THIS IS NICE 
THIS IS A LOVELY KITCHEN 
YEAH AND THAT GOES BACK A LOT WAY AND AN AGA TOO 
DOES THAT WORK I WONDER IT'S DECORATIVE ANYWAY ISN'T IT 
WOW THIS IS LOVELY 
I WONDER WHAT'S THROUGH HERE WHAT'S THROUGH THIS DOOR 
OH WOW THERE'S ANOTHER PANTRY 
HERE'S A QUESTION TO YOU AND YOU 
IS THAT A PANTRY OR IS THAT THE LARDER 
A SORT OF CONSERVATORY WHICH ISN'T QUITE A CONSERVATORY BUT QUITE NICE 
IT'S A NICE SORT OF SITTING SPACE 
IT IS A LOVELY EXTRA ISN'T IT IS IT TRULY A CONSERVATORY 
BECAUSE IT HAS A TILED ROOF NOT A GLASS ROOF 
THIS IS ANOTHER THING YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO 
RIGHT SHALL WE GO UPSTAIRS THEN THIS HOUSE HAS THE CHARACTER AND 
CHARM OF A PERIOD PROPERTY BECAUSE IT IS ONE BUT IT'S BEEN RESTORED LOVINGLY 
GET YOU FIT 
O. K. 
THE SMALLEST ROOM OH WOW OH THIS IS NICE 
O. K. SO THIS IS A LARGE TOILET REALLY 
OH WOW SO THIS IS THE BATH SLASH SHOWER 
O. K. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE LINO ON THE FLOOR IT JUST FEELS A BIT CHEAP 
HOW DARE HE 
BUT THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THE REST OF IT 
THIS IS NICE IT'S A GOOD SIZE 
YEAH I LIKE IT EDWARD WE ARE BROACHING THE BEDROOM TERRITORY 
O. K. SO A BEDROOM 
I'M GUESSING THIS PROBABLY ISN'T THE MASTER BEDROOM 
IT'S A BIT SMALL FOR THAT YOU'D HAVE TO TAKE A RUNNING JUMP AT THE BED YES 
IT'S NOT A BAD SECOND ROOM AND IT'S GOT BUILT IN WARDROBES 
WHAT'S THIS BEDROOM GOT THAT THE OTHER HASN'T GOT I DON'T KNOW 
IT'S A QUIZ I'VE GOT THE ANSWER TO 
DOUBLE GLAZING ON THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE WHERE THERE'S NO TRAFFIC 
DOUBLE GLAZING ON THE BACK BEDROOM NOT DOUBLE GLAZING ON THE FRONT 
IT'S KIND OF TEDIOUS ISN'T IT 
O. K. I SUPPOSE THIS IS THE MAIN BED 
IT'S QUITE A NICE SIZE 
YEAH BUILT IN WARDROBES YEP YOU WOULDN'T NEED 
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE THOSE WOULD YOU 
I CAN'T TELL WHETHER THEY WANT TO EMBRACE ME WITH A HUG OR IF THEY DESPISE ME RIGHT NOW 
AND THEN OUR BIG BED 
WOULD FIT JUST I THINK IT PROBABLY WOULD FIT WOULDN'T IT 
IT MIGHT BE A SQUEEZE ROUND THE DOOR NO THE BIG BED WOULD FIT 
I AM GETTING QUITE A BIT OF ROAD NOISE HERE YEAH 
I THINK THAT WENT FIFTY FIFTY THE BED WENT DOWN WELL THE ROAD NOISE WAS A BIT OF AN ISSUE 
OH WOW 
THEY'VE GONE UP ANOTHER LEVEL 
THREE STOREYS OF PLEASURE AND THEY'VE REACHED THE TOP THE ATTIC 
O. K. SO THIS IS THE OFFICE YEAH YEAH 
BUT IT COULD BE USED AS A BEDROOM AND THERE'S SOME MORE CUPBOARD SPACE AS WELL WARDROBES 
I'LL HAVE A QUICK PEEK O. K. 
YEAH AGAIN THAT'S QUITE A GOOD SPACE ISN'T IT 
IT'S A LOT BETTER ON THE INSIDE THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE FROM THE OUTSIDE 
SHALL WE GO AND TELL THEM WHAT WE THOUGHT 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT KRISTIAN HAS TO SAY 
I FEEL THEY REALISE THEY DID JUDGE THE BOOK BY THE COVER WHICH THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE 
NOW I'M GOING TO COVER SOME OTHER THINGS ABOUT THIS CHARMING BOOK 
VICKY I FELT THAT YOU NEITHER LOVED NOR HATED THE HOUSE I FEEL THAT YOU WERE AMBIVALENT TO IT IN EVERY WAY 
YES THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD SUMMARY OF MY VIEWS 
LET'S FOCUS MAYBE ON THE GARDEN BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU WANTED A GARDEN 
IT'S LOW MAINTENANCE IT'S EFFORTLESS IT'S MINIMAL IS IT YOUR KIND OF THING 
WELL NO WE KIND OF LIKE TO DO A BIT OF GARDENING SO WE'D PROBABLY DIG IT UP 
YOU'RE GOING TO DIG IT ALL UP WELL WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT IS 
THERE'S QUITE A LOT FOR YOU TO DIG UP IT KEEPS GOING ON YOU'VE GOT THESE FENCE PANELS 
AND IT GOES ON AND ON YOU'VE GOT A HUGE TAJ MAHAL OF A GARDEN SHED THERE LOOK AT THAT 
I WANT TO HEAR YOU BEING CREATIVE I WANT TO HEAR YOU DOING THINGS 
YOU'VE DUG IT UP WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT 
WELL BEHIND THIS BIT I THINK THIS IS A PERFECT VEGETABLE PATCH 
IT'S CRYING OUT FOR HOME MADE VEGGIES 
YEAH 
THE BIT THAT LINKS FOR THE ACCESS WOULD HAVE TO BE GATED OFF 
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY WANDERING IN WHILE I'M IN THE GARDEN 
NO O. K. FAIR ENOUGH BUT YOU WOULD BE PREPARED 
TO TAKE SOMETHING ON LIKE THIS AND MAKE A GREEN HAVEN 
IT'S JUST LIFTING UP A FEW SLABS AND DIGGING IT OVER 
O. K. NOT ONLY AM I GIVING YOU A VERY GOOD SIZE LENGTHY GARDEN 
I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE UP MY SLEEVE THAT YOU WILL LIKE THIS WAY OOH 
NOW VICKY WE'LL JUST PART THESE BUSHES HERE WE'LL COME ROUND TO THIS BID OF LAND HERE 
LOOK AT YOU DEMONSTRATIVELY STRIDING OUT 
WE REUNITE YOU TOGETHER WHICH IS LOVELY WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SAY ABOUT THIS LAND 
IT'S PARKING IT'S PARKING 
AND IT'S ABOUT HOUSES 
THE HOUSE YOU'VE JUST SEEN YEAH 
UH AH NO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE WOULDN'T IT 
THIS IS THE WORST SALES SPIEL I'VE EVER SEEN ALL RIGHT HERE WE GO HE'S GOT MORE 
O. K. THIS LAND HERE WHICH IS CLOSE TO YOUR PROPERTY DOESN'T BELONG TO YOUR PROPERTY 
BUT YOU CAN PARK YOUR CAR HERE FOR A LITTLE TINY TINY PEPPERCORN RENT 
FROM THE OWNER THAT DOES OWN IT AND THEN YOU CAN SQUEEZE THROUGH AS WE DID DID YOU NOT LIKE THAT 
IS THAT GOOD WELL I SUPPOSE 
YOU WANTED PARKING AND I SAID YOU'D GET SOME NO IT'S GOOD 
IT KEEPS US TRIM HAVING TO EDGE PAST THAT 
WHO'D WANT TO CRAWL THROUGH A HEDGE 
WHO WOULDN'T I KNOW IT WOULDN'T BOTHER ME 
HERE WE ARE ARE YOU SPEAKING TO ANDREW AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T WHEN 
DEPENDS HOW HE GUESSES THE PRICE 
GUESS THE PRICE IT'S A TOUGH COMPETITION 
WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST

TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND

ABSOLUTELY DO YOU THINK IT COULD BE ANY BETTER THAN THIS YES 
NO LET'S GO THIS WAY 
PROPERTY TWO IS A JEWEL ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF A SHREWSBURY CROWN 
THIS CONVERTED STATION MASTER'S HOUSE WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN OH ONE BUT HAS BEEN REFURBISHED TO PERFECTION 
WHILST STILL PRESERVING THE FEEL AND APPEAL OF A PERIOD PROPERTY 
IT PROUDLY BOASTS THE CONVENIENCE AND CHIC OF MODERN LIVING 
WITH THREE BEDROOMS A STUDY AND AMPLE PARKING KRISTIAN 
LET'S SEE IF VICKY AND ANDREW CONCUR THAT THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE CORKER 
ANDREW AND VICKY WE ARE AT PROBABLY THE HOUSE OF YOUR DREAMS 
THE HOUSE WHERE YOU WILL EVENTUALLY END UP HAVING CHILDREN 
AND CHILDREN'S CHILDREN AND CHILDREN'S CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 
THIS IS NOTHING SHORT OF SPECTACULAR 
IT HAS AIR CONDITIONING IT'S WARM UP FLOOR NOT THROUGHOUT BUT IN QUITE A LOT OF AREAS 
IT REALLY IS LOVELY IT'S LIKE OLDE WORDLY ON THE OUTSIDE AND YOU GET MODERN INSIDE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK FROM THE OUTSIDE 
I REALLY LIKE IT I THINK IT'S QUITE QUIRKY THE WAY THE FRONT AND THE BACK GARDEN IS HERE 
BUT YEAH I THINK IT'S GOT POTENTIAL 
LET'S COMPARE IT TO MAYBE KRISTIAN'S PROPERTY I THINK IT'S BETTER 
COMPARED WITH KRISTIAN'S OBVIOUSLY FROM THE OUTSIDE IT'S A LOT MORE IMPRESSIVE 
BUT YOU'RE STILL DOING WHAT YOU DID FIRST TIME ROUND JUDGING A BOOK BY ITS COVER 
WE'VE REALISED THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO GO HOUSE HUNTING YOU CAN'T JUST 
ACTUALLY WE DO ALWAYS ASK WHAT'S YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS MAYBE KIND OF OUR FAULT 
SO WE KNOW WE THINK WE LIKE IT WE'VE JUDGED THIS BOOK BY ITS 
COVER AND WE'RE LIKING THE BOOK I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE ERUPT AND ON THAT ERUPT ERUPT 
ARE YOU READY 
THREE TWO ONE GO 
GO GO GO GO 
I FEEL BAD FOR YOU KRISTIAN BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING WELL IS IT 
I TAKE IT AS A GIVEN THAT I'M A MISUNDERSTOOD GENIUS AND IN 
YEARS TO COME PEOPLE WILL REVIEW THESE SHOWS AND GO HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING 
KIND OF LIKE THE PIANO GENIUS IN THE FILM SHINE YOU'LL SEE 
HIS ROOMS ARE TOO SMALL

BREAKFAST BAR OOH WITH A TELLY 
BIT MODERN BUT YOU KNOW NOT BAD 
THE T. V.'S JUST AN EXTRA 
AND PROBABLY WHEN THEY BUY THE HOUSE THEY'LL FIND THE T. V.'S GONE

WOW STUNNING THIS IS REALLY NICE 
THEY HAVE WALKED INTO THE SUPER DUPER SUPER DUPER WHERE 
OFFICE YES 
NOT TAKING BEDROOM SPACE HAVING A SEPARATE 
YEAH AND THEN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WINDOWS 
YOU CAN OPEN THERE'S AN AIR CONDITIONING UNIT THERE AS WELL 
AND NO DISTRACTIONS OUT THE WINDOW 
NICE WOOD FLOORS AGAIN AND WHAT'S THIS IS THIS CUPBOARD SPACE 
THEY'RE THERE TO GIVE ACCESS TO THE WASHING MACHINE AND DISHWASHER 
OH WOW A DOWNSTAIRS LOO I LIKE THIS YEAH 
ED'S DOING AN AMAZING JOB HERE TOP MARKS POOR KRISTIAN EH 
WHAT DID SHE SAY 
MUCH BETTER THAN YOU WHAT PERSONALITY FACIALLY EVERYTHING

GETS BETTER AND BETTER DOESN'T IT 
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE AMOUNT OF PRAISE YOU'RE GETTING 
BIT OF CORRIDOR GOING THROUGH IT REALLY THOUGH 
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT TO GET TO ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE 
BUT THEN YOU HAVE A DINING TABLE IN HERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE YEAH 
LET'S GO ON THROUGH THE DOOR 
THIS IS A NICE SIZE TOO 
THAT'S NOT BAD AT ALL A NICE LOUNGE HERE 
YES I KNOW I PICKED IT 
IT'S ACTUALLY STILL QUITE QUIET FROM THE ROAD NOISE OUTSIDE 
IT'S THAT DOUBLE GLAZING THAT HELPS 
NICE HIGH CEILING IT'S NOT TOO CLAUSTROPHOBIC ONWARD 
UP THE STAIRS UP THE STAIRS 
IT'S NOT QUITE AS STEEP 
GRANDAD COULD COME UP YES 
THIS IS VERY SOLID ISN'T IT YEAH GOOD PIECE OF WOOD AGAIN 
THIS IS A GOOD SIZED ROOM 
THIS IS A GUEST ROOM YES 
I THINK OUR BED'S WIDER THAN THIS YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE US THAT CUPBOARD OTHERWISE 
NO BUT WE'LL SEE 
FINGERS CROSSED WE'LL SEE HOW IT WORKS 
THREE DOUBLE SIZED BEDROOMS IN THERE THEY COULD CHOSE ANY ONE OF THOSE THREE 
BUT ARE THEY KING SIZE 
ANOTHER GOOD ROOM 
YEAH LOTS OF LIGHT IN HERE 
I LIKE ALL THEIR FURNISHINGS AS WELL YES CAN WE BUY THEM 
I TELL YOU THEY WANT THE HOUSE THEY WANT THE FURNISHINGS THEY CAN'T 
AND THE SIZE OF THE SHOWER THAT'S A GOOD SHOWER 
WE COULD BOTH FIT IN THERE AND WE TRIED IT EARLIER ON KRISTIAN AND I 
YOU CAN GET TWO PEOPLE IN 
IT'S EVEN GOT A LITTLE PLACE FOR YOU TO PUT YOUR TOWELS ISN'T THAT HANDY 
THIS IS VERY NICE RADIATOR LOOK AT THAT CLASSY RADIATOR 
THAT'S NICE AND BIG EVERYONE LIKES A NICE RADIATOR 
YOU AND THEM ARE PRAISING ANYTHING 
QUITE LOW THE CEILINGS 
TILES ARE A BIT DARK FOR ME IF I WAS TO HAVE A CRITICISM BUT I REALLY THINK IT'S NOT BAD IS IT 
NO IT'S LIVEABLE 
IT'S MORE THAN LIVEABLE IT'S GORGEOUS SO FAR IT IS 
AH HA IT'S LIKE A PROPERTY WOLF WHISTLE THAT TO ME 
ANOTHER BIG BEDROOM O. K. 
NOW WE'VE WORKED OUT THAT ALL THE BEDROOMS ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME SIZE AREN'T THEY GIVE OR TAKE 
THE FIRST BEDROOM MUST'VE BEEN THE MASTER WHICH MIGHT CAUSE A PROBLEM 
THIS IS ONE OF THE TOP ONES THAT WE'VE SEEN EVEN LOOKING ON OUR OWN ISN'T IT 
YES TRUE DEFINITELY AS LONG AS THE DIMENSIONS OF THE OTHER ROOM FIT TO OUR BED 
WE SHOULD GO AND HAVE A CHAT WITH KRISTIAN AND ED YEAH 
TO SUMMARISE I DON'T THINK PRAISE COMES MUCH BETTER THAN THAT 
I FEEL PRETTY MUCH LIKE THE GUY WHEN HE INVENTED SLICED BREAD 
JUST THAT WARM GLOW ALL OVER ME NOW 
I'M GOING TO GO AND CHAT TO THEM PROBABLY RECEIVE A KISS OR A PAT ON THE BACK 
SEE YOU LATER 
ANDREW AND VICKY I FELT YOU WERE LIKE A PAIR OF YOUNG PRINCE CHARLES GAZING AT HIGHGROVE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME LOOKING AT THAT PROPERTY YOU LOVED IT N'EST PA 
YES IT'S LOVELY 
THERE WAS ONE PROBLEM WHICH I THINK I'VE GOT A SOLUTION FOR AND THAT PROBLEM 
JUST CUT TO THE CHASE THE BED DIDN'T FIT AND WHAT DID YOU SAY WAS VERY IMPORTANT 
THAT THE BED FITTED MY SOLUTION 
THOSE BEDSIDE TABLES THROW THEM IN THE SKIP THEN IT'S FINE 
I'VE ACTUALLY GOT A BETTER SOLUTION 
THE TWO FITTED WARDROBES THAT ARE EITHER SIDE OF THE CHIMNEY BREAST 
IF ONE OF THEM THAT WAS NEAREST THE BED WAS TAKEN AWAY 
THEN THE TWO BEDSIDE CABINETS AND MY BED WOULD FIT IN PERFECTLY 
I HAVE A BETTER SOLUTION WHAT'S THAT 
O. K. MY SOLUTION IS IF WE GO BACK TO PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
NO LET ME SPEAK 
NO THIS COULD GET YOU IN TROUBLE 
PLEASE JUST HEAR ME OUT IF WE GO BACK TO PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
LISTEN IF WE GO BACK TO PROPERTY ONE THE BEDROOM THERE IS TWELVE X. TWELVE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST DID THAT 
NO ONE CARES ABOUT PROPERTY ONE 
DO THEY NO S. O. RRY 
NO ONE CARES SORRY KRISTIAN 
HERE'S THE POINT I DO LIKE THIS BIT 
YOU'VE SEEN ED'S CHOICE MAYBE IT'LL BE TOO EXPENSIVE IT WILL PUT YOU OFF 
YOUR BUDGET WAS 
TWO HUNDRED FORTY O. K. AND YOUR GUESS ON THIS HOUSE IS 
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY RIGHT HERE YOU GO 
OH HELLO SOMEONE IS WITHIN FIVE OF THE PRICE WHO THINKS THEY ARE THAT PERSON 
MAINE IT IS YOU I'M SORRY I'VE GONE OVER BUDGET IT IS FIVE LESS THAN 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BUT REMEMBER YOU CAN HAGGLE WITH THESE PEOPLE 
SO IT'S A LOVELY HOUSE WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO HIS ONE DO WE 
NO STUPID YOU FOR MENTIONING IT REALLY SO WE COULD GO WHERE 
TO THE WILD CARD 
WHICH WAY WHICH WAY DO YOU THINK IT IS 
THAT WAY 
IT ISN'T IT'S THIS WAY 
NOW WHAT CAN I TELL YOU ABOUT OUR WILD CARD 
I CAN SAY THIS IT'S AN OUTRIGHT STAR 
THREE FLOORS TWO RECEPTION ROOMS A CHARMING COURTYARD AND A MAMMOTH 
FIVE BEDROOMS ONE OF WHICH WOULD DWARF VICKY'S PRIZED GARGANTUAN SIZED BED 
IN THE HEART OF SHREWSBURY TOWN CENTRE AND ONLY A BUTTERFLY WING 
FLAP FROM STUNNING PARKS AND THE PICTURESQUE RIVER SEVERN 
YEP WELL LET'S HOPE THAT ANDREW AND VICKY COULD ACCENTUATE THOSE POSITIVES 
O. K. VICKY AND ANDREW HERE WE ARE ARRIVING AT THE WILD CARD AND IT'S 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WHO AM I KIDDING 
LET'S NOT DO THE WILD CARD THERE'S NO POINT 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY POINT IN THE WILD CARD 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE REALLY DOWN ON IT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO INSIDE AND BRING IT TO LIFE 
I'M HURT HURT TO THE CORE DON'T BE HURT THROW DOWN THE GAUNTLETS 
WITH ME GO IN THERE AND PROVE ME WRONG 
I THINK THEY SHOULD DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT WE CAN DO THAT 
IT NEEDS WORK IT STINKS OF POTENTIAL THOUGH IT REALLY DOES 
THE KEY WORD EVERYWHERE AND ALSO THE ROOMS ARE QUITE 
UNUSUAL SHAPES THEY'RE ODD 
BUT GO IN THERE AND SEE IF YOU CAN JUDGE THIS BOOK BY ITS COVER 
NO YOU DON'T JUDGE IT DON'T JUDGE IT BY THE COVER 
GET IN THERE AND READ EVERY CHAPTER 
GO ON GET IN THERE GO 
I THOUGHT YOU'D REALLY GONE BAD AT THE START THERE 
NO I'VE GOT THEM ALL HYPED UP THEY'RE NOW GOING TO USE THEIR BRAINS 
WHAT AN ENJOYABLE WILD CARD THIS WILL BE 
WELLITY WELLITY WELLITY WELLITY DO YOU THINK THIS WILL BACKFIRE YOUR ELABORATE PLAN OR NOT 
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO SEE THE POSITIVES NOW 
ALL RIGHT FINGERS CROSSED O. K. WHAT DID KRISTIAN SAY 
KEEP MINDS OPEN H. M. M. THIS IS A. 
VERY SMALL SITTING ROOM I GUESS 
I FEEL IT'S A BIT LIKE LILLIPUT 
THIS HASN'T GONE DOWN WELL I THINK THEY'RE STILL REBOUNDING FROM YOUR VERY HARSH ATTACK ON THEM 
NO I WANTED TO GET THEM SLIGHTLY ANGRY AND HYPED UP SO THEY WOULD 
GO IN HERE AND WOULD PROVE ME WRONG 
THEY SAID THE DIMENSIONS WERE WEIRD BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHERE YOU'D 
PUT ANYTHING PUT ANYTHING 
YOU COULD GET A SOFA IN HERE AND VERY LITTLE ELSE BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ROAD NOISE 
IT HASN'T GOT DOUBLE GLAZING AND IT'S RIGHT BY THAT ROAD 
CAN YOU HEAR IT THAT'S QUITE NOISY 
ORDINARILY THE TRAFFIC ISN'T THIS BAD THE TRAFFIC'S BEEN DIVERTED FOR ROADWORKS 
YOU'VE PUT YOUR RESEARCH IN TODAY IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH QUIETER THAN THIS 
THIS IS SLIGHTLY BIGGER 
YES IT IS BIGGER 
IT HAS ACTUALLY GOT HIGH CEILINGS A NICE FIREPLACE AGAIN YEAH 
IT'S DIFFERENT AND IT'S ALL ALL VERY ODD SHAPES ISN'T IT 
THERE'S NOT A RIGHT ANGLE ANYWHERE WELL ONLY A FEW 
SO THEY'RE COMING INTO THE KITCHEN NOW SO WE'VE GOT TO BE EVER SO SLIGHTLY QUIET 
WHISPERING LIKE THIS MY DEEP BASSY VOICE BOOMING INTO YOUR HOMES 
THAT'S A. AN AGA OF SOME DESCRIPTION 
I WONDER IF IT WORKS 
THOSE CAST IRON RANGES OFTEN OVER TIME THEY GET CRACKED OR DAMAGED 
YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET THEM REPAIRED AT GOOD SPECIALISTS 
WHAT A USEFUL TIP THAT IS 
I'M SERIOUS YOU CAN GET SPECIALISTS 
REALLY SOMETHING THAT'S BROKEN YOU CAN GET IT FIXED 
AWFUL KITCHEN H. M. M. THIS NEEDS QUITE A LOT OF WORK 
NO IT NEEDS RIPPING OUT 
NOT ONLY WOULD THEY BE TAKING ON A SIZEABLE DIY PROJECT 
A MASSIVE DIY PROJECT O. K. HUGE BUT THEY ARE BUYING A GREAT BIG SLICE OF SHREWSBURY HISTORY 
YES THEY REALLY ARE 
O. K. THIS IS NARROW 
YES AGAIN EVERY SINGLE ROOM IN HERE IS A STRANGE SHAPE 
GO INTO THOSE ROOMS AND ALL I ASK THEM IS TO TAP ONTO THE WALLS 
TO DISCOVER THEY'RE ACTUALLY STUD WALLS AND NOT SOLID WALLS 
HE'S RIGHT HE'S RIGHT THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING 
AND A MAIN BATHROOM WITH ANOTHER SHOWER 
I WONDER WHY THEY DIDN'T JUST KNOCK THIS WALL DOWN AND HAVE A BIG BATHROOM 
I DON'T KNOW KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK HOLLOW AS ANYTHING IN THERE 
ALL RIGHT IT'S NOT THAT GREAT AND THERE'S MOULD THAT'S NOT A BIG ISSUE BUT 
NO I'M NOT LOVING IT 
O. K. LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE THERE IS 
SO THIS WOULD BE A BEDROOM 
PROBABLY YEAH 
IT'S A WEIRD SHAPE SO WHERE WOULD YOU PUT FURNITURE 
WHERE WOULD YOU PUT THE BED 
IF YOU HAD A BED ALONG THERE THEN IT WOULD BLOCK THIS 
I DON'T KNOW YOU COULD MAKE IT INTO A STUDY 
I DON'T KNOW I HAVE TO SEE HOW MANY ROOMS THERE ARE IN THE HOUSE AND WHAT WOULD WORK 
THIS IS THE GIFT WITH THIS WILDCARD CHOICE 
NOT ONE NOT TWO NOT THREE 
KEEP GOING SPEED IT UP 
NOT FOUR BUT FIVE BEDROOMS 
DIFFERENT 
THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER ROOM OH YES 
NICE FIREPLACE AGAIN 
CHARACTER FEATURES BUT AGAIN THE THING IS THE SHAPE OF THE ROOM ISN'T IT WHERE WOULD YOU PUT ANYTHING 
I SUPPOSE THE ONLY REAL PLACE TO PUT A BED WOULD BE HERE 
O. K. 
GOD WHAT IS THIS 
I REALISE AN OPEN MIND 
THIS IS 
AN UNUSABLE BIT OF LOFT SPACE WITH SOME LOVELY BITS OF WOOD IN 
O. K. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE NOT ENOUGH ROOM 
I'M GOING TO PRETEND THAT TOUR NEVER HAPPENED REALLY 
SHALL WE GO AND CHAT WITH THEM 
YOU BE NICE TO THEM I'M GOING TO BE LOVELY GOOD 
VICKY DID YOU LIKE THE HOUSE 
NO NEVERTHELESS I HAVE A TIP FOR YOU THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU LIKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE 
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE ANY CAR PARKING HERE BECAUSE WE ARE ON A MAIN ROAD 
THE DENTIST NEXT DOOR WILL LET YOU PARK YOUR CAR IN HIS CAR PARKING SPACE FOR A NOMINAL RENT 
ALSO THE CAR PARKS IN THE AREA THEY RUN A RESIDENTS' CAR PARKING SCHEME 
YOU HAVE TO PAY MONEY FOR THAT OR YOU COULD RENT A DOUBLE GARAGE FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CALENDAR MONTH 
DOES THAT HELP 
THAT'S JUST BROUGHT IT DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT 
THE HOUSE I ALREADY DIDN'T LIKE AND NOW I LIKE IT A LITTLE BIT LESS 
O. K. WELL YOU MIGHT LIKE IT MORE WHEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT THE PRICE IS 
TWENTY ALL RIGHT WELL LET'S GO AND HOPE IT IS TWENTY ALL RIGHT 
WOW YOU WERE SO GOING FOR IT UP THERE REINVENTING THE SPACES LOOKING AT POSITIVELY WHAT YOU 
COULD DO WITH THOSE ROOMS DIDN'T YOU 
YES NO NOT AT ALL BAMBOOZLED WERE YOU 
YES IT'S SUCH A STRANGE SHAPE EVERY SINGLE ROOM IS LIKE A WEDGE I DON'T KNOW 
HOW WE'D USE THE ROOMS IN HERE AT ALL 
IT'S LIKE KIND OF LIVING IN A WEDGE OF WENSLEYDALE 
O. K. I MEAN OLD BUILDING ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT SHE IS AN ODD ONE BUT IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU USE THE SPACE 
IN RECENT TIMES I THINK WHAT'S UNUSUAL ABOUT IT IS BECAUSE IT'S 
BEEN USED AS OFFICES SO IT'S ALL BEEN CARVED UP A LITTLE BIT 
BUT I MEAN DOWN HERE BECAUSE THESE TWO MAIN ROOMS ARE QUITE SMALL AND WEIRD ANGLES WHAT ABOUT USING THAT 
ROOM IN THERE AS A DINING ROOM AND THIS ROOM AS AN OFFICE AND THEN HAVING YOUR LOUNGE UPSTAIRS 
I MEAN THAT MIGHT WORK BECAUSE THE ROOM UPSTAIRS IS LARGER THAN THIS 
AHA SO THAT MIGHT WORK BUT THEN YOU DO LOSE ONE OF THE BEDROOMS 
YOU'RE BEING NASTY AGAIN SORRY A BIT NEGATIVE 
WHAT ABOUT PRICE AND THEN MAYBE THAT WOULD SMOOTH THINGS OVER 
LET'S TALK ABOUT PRICE 
LET'S TALK ABOUT PRICE 
VICKY IF YOU COULD CARE TO STAND BY YOUR PARTNER 
THAT WENT WELL BY THE SOUNDS OF IT WE JUST CAUGHT THE TAIL END OF THAT 
THE GOOD OLD TIP ABOUT LIVING UP THERE 
DESCRIBING IT LIKE LIVING IN WENSLEYDALE DIDN'T HELP REALLY 
NO I DON'T THINK 
O. K. YOU'VE EXPERIENCED THE HOUSE MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME SLIGHT RESERVATIONS 
THE HOUSE ITSELF WAS AN EXPERIENCE 
YES AND IT'S A WILD CARD SO WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE PRICE IS 
KRISTIAN THE PRICE IS 
OH THEY NEED TO GUESS YES THAT WOULD HELP GO ON HAVE A GUESS 
MY TURN TO GO FIRST ISN'T IT IT'S SUCH A WEIRD HOUSE I'VE GOT NO IDEA 
THE LOCATION'S GOOD I'M GOING TO GO FOR TWO HUNDRED TEN 
TWO HUNDRED TEN INTERESTING O. K. VICKY 
I WOULD SAY LOWER THAN THAT ONE HUNDRED NINETY NINE DON'T BE CRUEL ON THAT HOUSE 
MY OLD FRIEND ANDREW IS CLOSEST FOR THE THIRD TIME 
YOU HAVE LET YOURSELF DOWN MIGHTILY 
YOU HAVE LET YOURSELF DOWN BUT THE ACTUAL PRICE IS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
LESS OF THE GIGGLING 
IT LEAVES YOU WITH AN INTERESTING CONUNDRUM YOU HAVE SEEN THREE VERY 
DIFFERENT PROPERTIES YOU NEED TO DECIDE WHICH ONE YOU'D LIKE TO TEST DRIVE TOUGH ISN'T IT 
IT IS A TRICKY ONE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D CHOSE 
I'M SENSING A LITTLE BIT OF SARCASM 
I HAVE NO IDEA GO AWAY IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT DECISION SO GO THAT WAY AND WE WILL SEE YOU LATER 
PROBABLY IN TEN SECONDS ALL RIGHT MARVELLOUS IT IS A TOUGH ONE 
WHAT WILL THEY CHOOSE I DON'T KNOW 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED NOW 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HELP 
WILL THEY CHOSE MINE DO YOU WANT HELP HE'S NOT LISTENING 
WHAT WOULD HELP IS A RECAP 
OH YES FOR YOU AT HOME 
AND I REALLY STILL BELIEVE MY PROPERTY 
IS HARD TO BEAT THREE BEDROOMS PERIOD FEATURES A LOVELY EXTENSION 
WALKING DISTANCE TO THE TOWN CENTRE AND A GARDEN FULL OF POTENTIAL 
AND ONLY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
YOU'RE DELUDING YOURSELF MY HOUSE HAS EVERYTHING THAT VICKY AND ANDREW ARE AFTER A PERIOD HOUSE 
BRIMMING WITH CHARACTER THREE BEDS OFF ROAD PARKING A PLUSH GARDEN AND EVEN A BARBECUE AREA 
SHEER RADIANCE FOR TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
WELL IN THAT CASE WE'RE BOTH DECEIVING OURSELVES WITH THE WILD CARD A THREE 
STOREY CLASSIC FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT EVEN WITH THE FIVE BEDROOMS OUR TWO WERE WON OVER 
I AGREE YOU COULDN'T GET MUCH MORE SALOPIAN THAN THIS GEM IF YOU TRIED 
BUT I GUESS WEDGE SHAPED LIVING MAY JUST HAVE WORKED IN MY FAVOUR 
IT'S A POTENTIAL BARGAIN THOUGH AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
ANDREW AND VICKY WHAT A FOREGONE CONCLUSION THIS WAS 
YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO TEST DRIVE 
YOUR PROPERTY YES YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE TO TEST DRIVE HIS ONE DID YOU NO 
NO THEY DIDN'T O. K. WELL REALISTICALLY LET'S JUST GET IT OUT THERE WHY DID YOU GO FOR THIS ONE 
IT WAS BETTER IN EVERY SINGLE WAY YES IT WAS WASN'T IT 
SORRY KRISTIAN THAT'S ALL RIGHT IT HAD THREE GOOD BEDROOMS AND A STUDY AREA AS WELL 
IT'S ALL IN GOOD NICK AND IT'S A NICE LOCATION 
NO CROWBAR REQUIRED 
WELL I DO LOVE YOU REALLY AND I'M PLEASED 
YOU LIKE IT AND THAT YOU'RE LOVING IT SO MUCH DO YOU KNOW WHO ALSO LOVED THIS PROPERTY 
OH I KNOW DARWIN ER NO DARWIN WOULD HAVE LIKED IT 
WE'VE HAD OUR SURVEYOR HAVE A LOOK AT THIS PROPERTY AND HE'S GIVEN IT 
A THOROUGH GOING OVER HE'S LOOKED INSIDE HE'S LOOKED OUT 
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID NOTHING WRONG WITH IT 
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH IT IT'S NOT LEGALLY BINDING HE LOVES THE PROPERTY 
HE SAID IT WAS TASTEFULLY DONE THERE'S BEEN AN EXTENSION 
BUT IT'S BLENDED IN BEAUTIFULLY HE WAS FULL OF PRAISE 
SO THERE YOU GO YOU'VE GOT THE HOUSE OF YOUR DREAMS THANK YOU 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT I THINK WE SHOULD TURN OUR BACKS GIVE YOU TEN SECONDS 
AND THEN HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE IN THERE FOR THE TEST DRIVE LET'S DO IT 
ALL RIGHT LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS ONE TWO THREE 
WELL WE CAN TURN AROUND AND SEE IF THEY'VE GONE THEY'VE GONE 
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW 
HAVE YOU ORGANISED ANYTHING YOU ARE ABOUT TO LOVE ME REALLY 
I'VE BOOKED IN A HISTORY TRIP IN SHREWSBURY ABOUT DARWIN 
A NO BRAINER ED EH IT LOOKS LIKE VICKY AND ANDREW 
ANDREW STILL HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THEIR BED FITTING SITUATION EVEN IN YOUR FABULOUS HOUSE 
YEP WELL THERE'S STILL NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THIS IS THE HOUSE FOR THEM 
GOOD TO CLEAR THEIR HEADS THEY'VE TAKEN THEMSELVES OFF 
FOR A STROLL IN ONE OF SHREWSBURY'S LUSCIOUS PARKS KNOWN COLLOQUIALLY AS HAVING A MINGLE IN THE DINGLE 
AND QUITE FRANKLY WHO COULD BLAME THEM NOT I KRISTIAN NOT I 
BUT LET'S FOCUS ON MY HOUSE NOW WHEN YOU FIND A HOUSE YOU LIKE 
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO BUT GET MUM AND DAD TO COME OVER AND PERUSE ITS DELIGHTS 
AND IT HASN'T TAKEN ANDREW LONG TO CLAIM THAT STUNNING STUDY AS HIS OWN 
AND THEY'RE BEING MEN ABOUT IT PRACTICAL TO THE CORE 
IF THAT STUDY WAS MADE OF TYRE RUBBER I BET THEY'D KICK IT 
IF I WAS ANDREW I'D BE WORRIED 
THAT BED SEEMS TO BE ALL THAT VICKY THINKS ABOUT AND SHE'S DRAGGED MUM ALONG TO SEE IF IT'LL FIT WILL IT 
WILL IT IT PAINS ME TO SAY BUT I THINK IT JUST MIGHT 
VICKY AND ANDREW YOU ARE WELCOME AND ALL THANKS TO ME 
THEY CAN NOW RELAX WITH A CONGRATULATORY GLASS OF SOMETHING 
LET'S GO AND SEE IF THEY HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT DEFINITIVE QUESTION I ASKED ABOUT FORTY MINUTES AGO 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S BEEN A TOUGH JOURNEY IT HAS TO BE SAID 
WELL FOR YOU REALLY 
WELL FOR ME IT'S BEEN A TOUGH JOURNEY BUT I FEEL IT'S KIND OF SOMEHOW BEEN WORTH IT 
NOW WE'VE FINALLY FOUND A ROOM IN THE UNITED KINGDOM THAT FITS YOUR BED YES 
AAH 
OBVIOUSLY YOU LIKE THE HOUSE EVEN MORE 
DEFINE WHAT IT IS THAT YOU LIKE SO MUCH 
IT'S GOT THREE GOOD BEDROOMS IT'S GOT A STUDY IT'S ALL BEEN KITTED OUT 
INSIDE THEY'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON FITTING IT OUT WELL 
IS THIS YOUR TASTE YES 
GOOD YOU'VE DONE WELL 
I'M GOING TO GET IT OUT THOUGH BECAUSE I'M NERVOUS 
READY DEEP BREATH 
TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
IS THE REASON WHY HE'S NERVOUS 
TO BUY OH GOODNESS GRACIOUS 
I WANTED TO KISS ALL OF YOU THERE BUT I FEEL SOMEHOW THAT WOULD LOSE MY DIGNITY 
I'M OVER THE MOON I'M HAPPY I'M ECSTATIC I'M OVER THE MOON 
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T MY CHOICE I'M PLEASED IT'S BEEN NICE HASN'T IT 
IT HAS AND WHEN WE COME BACK TO SHREWSBURY CAN KRISTIAN AND I 
WE DON'T ALWAYS SAY THIS BUT IT IS PART OF THE SHOW WE'RE ALLOWED TO STAY WITH YOU 
OF COURSE IN THAT HUGE BED 
WE WERE THINKING THE LOFT MAYBE THE LOFT WOULD DO NICELY 
JUST HOUSE US WHEN WE COME BACK THAT'S THE REASON WE DO THIS SHOW 
WE ARE OFF NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE 
PUT THE KETTLE ON IT'S YOURS SEE YOU LATER BYE 
WELL WELL WELLITY WELL BRILLIANT 
TRUE TO OURSELVES UP THERE AND DOWN THERE EXCELLENT 
I DON'T WANT TO GO NEGATIVE AT THE END OF THE SHOW DON'T DO IT 
I'LL GO THERE TO ACHIEVE A BETTER POSITIVE 
AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW YOU CALLED ME A NEANDERTHAL I DIDN'T MEAN IT 
I'M NOT SURE BUT ANYWAY AT THE END OF THE PROGRAMME IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU ARE 
A PROPERTY NEANDERTHAL AND I AM THE APEX OF THE SPECIES 
IF DARWIN WERE ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE HAD ME STUFFED TO SHOW CHILDREN 
PLEASE I COULD DO THAT 
BUT THE REAL POINT HERE IS ONE THAT WAS HARSH TWO A NEANDERTHAL WOULDN'T WEAR 
SPORTING CASUALS LIKE THIS AND ALSO I HAVE A CHANCE TO PROVE MYSELF ON THE NEXT SHOW 
IN YOUR LUCKY JUMPER 
I'LL PROBABLY FIND A LUCKIER ONE BUT WHY NOT IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING 
TO FIND A DREAM HOUSE DO WHAT ANDREW AND VICKY DID CONTACT US AND WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN 
AND HOPEFULLY KRISTIAN WILL NOT BE WEARING THAT HIDEOUS CREATION 
I CAN WEAR THE ONE WITH SPARKLES ON
