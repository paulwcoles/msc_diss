GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO 
WEDNESDAY'S WORKING LUNCH TWO OF 
THE U. K.'S LEADING CHARITIES ARE 
TAKING THE GOVERNMENT TO COURT FOR 
NOT DOING ENOUGH TO HELP PEOPLE PAY 
THEIR FUEL BILLS 
THE GOVERNMENT'S FUEL POVERTY 
STRATEGY IS IN SHREDS AND TATTERS 
THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN FUEL 
POVERTY ARE RISING INSTEAD OF 
FALLING WE'VE NO OPTION LEFT BUT 
TO GO TO THE HIGH COURT AND SEEK A 
JUDGMENT THERE 
H. S. B. C. WANTS TO GIVE 
YOU A MORGUE GADGE IT'S OFFERING 
TO MATCH FIXED RATE DEALS WITH 
OTHER LENDERS WHEN IT COMES TO AN 
END END SHARES IN BANKS HAVING A REALLY 
TOUGH DAY OF IT 
AND CAN WE HOLD BACK THE SEA MUCH 
OF BRITAIN'S COASTLINE IS UNDER 
THREAT AN OFFICIAL POLICY FOR 
LARGE PARTS OF IT IS TO DO NOTHING 
TO PREVENT IT BUT I HAVE COME 
ALONG THE EAST ANGLIA TO FIND OUT 
WHAT CAN BE DONE 
THE GOVERNMENT'S 
FACING A LEGAL CHALLENGE FROM TWO 
CHARITIES ON FUEL POVERTY FRIENDS 
OF THE EARTH AND HELP THE AGED SAY 
MINISTERS AREN'T DOING ENOUGH TO 
HELP VULNERABLE PEOPLE CUT THEIR 
GAS AND ELECTRICITY BILLS 
IT'S NOT 
A PUBLICITY STUNT IT'S THE 
BEGINNING THOUGH OF A LONG ISH 
PROCESS THE PROCESS OF GOING 
THROUGH A JUDICIAL REVIEW COULD 
WELL TAKE US SEVERAL MONTHS MAYBE 
EVEN APPROACHING A YEAR SO WE'RE 
NOT LOOKING FOR QUICK WIN ON THIS 
ONE BUT WE DO WANT TO ACTUALLY 
MAKE THE POINT AND DRAW TO PUBLIC 
ATTENTION THE FACT THAT FUEL 
POVERTY IS RISING 
RACHEL FUEL POVERTY THIS PHRASE 
I SUPPOSE IT'S RELATIVELY NEW 
WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND ABOUT IT 
THE DEFINITION IS A HOUSEHOLD WHO 
SPENDS MORE THAN TEN PER CENT AT LEAST TEN PER CENT 
OF THEIR INCOME ON HEATING THEIR 
HOME THAT'S HEATING THEIR HOME TO 
AT LEAST TWENTY ONE IN THE LIVING AREAS AND 
EIGHTEEN IN THE REST OF THE HOUSE IN 
TWO THOUSAND ONE THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THEY 
WOULD BY TWO THOUSAND TEN ERADICATE FUEL 
POVERTY FOR VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS 
HOUSEHOLDS WITH ELDERLY PEOPLE 
PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY AND YOUNG 
CHILDREN THEY WANTED TO GET RID 
ALSO OF FUEL POVERTY FOR EVERY 
HOUSEHOLD BY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN 
THEY WANT TO GET 
RID OF IT WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN 
DOING TO MOVE US ALONG THAT PATH 
THE GOVERNMENT HAVING USING TWO 
STRATEGIES TO TRY TO ACHIEVE THIS 
THE FIRST THING THEY HAVE BEEN 
USING ARE WINTER FUEL ALLOWANCES 
THOSE ARE FOR PEOPLE OVER THE AGE 
OF SIXTY OR EIGHTY IF YOU'RE IN A 
HOUSEHOLD WITH SOMEBODYO OVER THE 
AGE OF SIXTY YOU SHOULD GET TWO HUNDRED TO 
HELP TOWARDS THE WINTER FUEL BILLS 
OVER EIGHTY YOU SHOULD GET THREE HUNDRED THOSE 
ARE RISING NEXT WINTER THE OTHER 
STRATEGY THE GOVERNMENT ARE USING 
IS TO TRY TO IMPROVE ENERGY 
EFFICIENCY THERE ARE DIFFERENT 
PROGRAMMES IN ENGLAND IT'S CALLED 
THE WARM FRONT SCHEME HOUSEHOLDS 
CAN APPLY FOREA GRANT OF UP TO 
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TO HELP THEM PAY FOR MORE 
EFFICIENT BOILER INSULATION AND 
DRAFT PROOFING THAT SORT OF THING 
THE GOVERNMENT ALSO HAVE BEEN 
TRYING TO GET ENERGY COMPANIES TO 
PROMOTE ENERGY EFFICIENCY 
ON THE 
FACE OF IT THAT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE 
DOING A LOT BUT THE FACT THAT 
THEY'RE BEING TAKEN TO COURT 
IMPLIES IT'S NOT WORKING 
UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T QUITE SEEM 
TO BE WORKING WE SHOULD SEE WHEN 
THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THESE 
TARGETS IN TWO THOUSAND ONE THERE WERE FOURTEEN 
MILLION VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS WITH 
FUEL POVERTY HOUSEHOLDS WITH 
ELDERLY DISABLED OR YOUNG CHILDREN THEY MANAGED TO GET THAT NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE IN FUEL POVERTY DOWN BUT AS 
FUEL PRICES ROCKETED THAT NUMBER 
ROSE IT'S TWENTY THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS 
TODAY 
TWO POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN FUEL TODAY POVERTY NOW 
HOUSEHOLDS SO EVEN 
MORE PEOPLE THE GOVERNMENT 
ESTIMATE THEY'LL GET THAT DOWN TO 
ONE POINT TWO MILLION BY TWO THOUSAND TEN TWO THOUSAND TEN WAS THE 
YEAR IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AT ZERO 
WHAT DO THE CAMPAIGNERS WANT FROM 
THE GOVERNMENT 
I SPOKE TO MERVYN 
KOHLER FROM HELP THE AGED TODAY HE 
SAYS THEY WANT TO SEE 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING MORE MONEY ON 
MAKING HOMES MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT 
YOU CAN DEAL WITH FUEL POVERTY IN 
TWO WAYS YOU CAN GIVE PEOPLE MORE 
MONEY ALLOW THEM TO BURN MORE FUEL 
WATCH IT GO UP THE CHIMNEY AND 
INCREASE POLLUTION IN THE 
ENVIRONMENT AND THAT SEEMS COCK 
EYED WAY FORWARD OR YOU INSULATE 
HOMES YOU IMPROVE HEATING SYSTEMS 
YOU DO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW 
HOW TO DO TO MAKE OUR HOUSING MORE 
ENERGY EFFICIENT THAT'S THE 
DIRECTION OF TRAVEL WE WANT TO GO 
IN 
NOW WE ASKED THE GOVERNMENT IN FOR THEIR RESPONSE THEY SENT US A 
STATEMENT IT SAID THE GOVERNMENT 
REMAINS COMMITTED TO SEEKING SO FAR 
AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AN END TO 
FUEL POVERTY WITHIN HOUSEHOLDS BY 
WITHIN VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS BY 
TWO THOUSAND TEN BUT IT'S THAT SO FAR AS IS 
REASONABLY PRACTICABLE THESE 
CAMPAIGNERS HAVE AN ISSUE WITH 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THEY HAVE 
OBVIOUSLY TAKEN THEM TO COURT WHAT 
HAPPENS NEXT 
THEY HAVE FILED A 
JUDICIAL REVIEW THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
THREE WEEKS TO FILE RESPONSE THEN 
THE JUDGE WILL SIT DOWN AND TAKE UP 
TO SIX WEEKS TO DECIDE WHAT IS TO 
BE ANSWERED IT'S ONLY IF THE JUDGE 
DECIDES IT IS TO BE ANSWERED THAT 
IT WOULD ACTUALLY GET TO COURT IF 
THE JUDGE WHO JUDGES IT WHEN HE 
GETS TO THE HIGH COURT THAT COULD 
TAKE ANOTHER COUPLE OF MONTHS 
BEFORE THEY GET A DATE IF THAT 
JUDGE DECIDES THEY'RE NOT DOING 
WHAT'S REASONABLY PRACTICABLE THEN 
THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO RETHINK 
THEIR BUSINESS PLAN RETHINK THEIR 
STRATEGY FOR HOW THEY'RE TRYING TO 
ACHIEVE THIS AIM 
RACHEL THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH INDEED WE SHOULD 
ACTUALLY SAY WHAT'S ON THIS TOPIC 
ON CONSUMING ISSUES THIS WEEK ON 
FRIDAY 
SO IF YOU'RE BAFFLED BY YOUR BILLS 
OR TROUBLED BY YOUR TARIFFS OR 
INDEED WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE 
GRANTS RACHEL WAS TALKING ABOUT DO 
GET IN TOUCH AT THE REGULAR E. MAIL 
AND EVEN THE POSTAL ADDRESS 
THANK YOU 
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE REST OF 
THE BUSINESS NEWS ALMOST NONE OF 
THE HOMEOWNERS CAUGHT IN LAST 
SUMMER'S FLOODING ARE PREPARED FOR 
A REPEAT OF WHAT HAPPENED A STUDY 
FOR THE INSURER NORWICH UNION 
SUGGESTS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE 
AFFECTED BELIEVE THERE IS NOTHING 
THEY CAN DO TO PROTECT THEIR HOME 
FROM FLOODING AS A RESULT NINE 
OUT OF TEN HOUSEHOLDS SAID THEY HAD 
NOT TAKEN ANY MEASURES TO PREPARE 
FOR ANY SIMILAR EVENT 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND POLICYMAKERS 
START THEIR TWO DAY DELIBERATIONS 
ON INTEREST RATES AMID GATHERING 
SIGNS OF ECONOMIC GLOOM AS THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH TIGHTENS ITS GRIP 
THE BANK'S MONETARY POLICY 
COMMITTEE IS WIDELY TIPPED TO CUT 
RATES WHEN IT MAKES ITS 
ANNOUNCEMENT TOMORROW LUNCH TIME 
WE WILL OF COURSE ON WORKING 
LUNCH HAVE THAT DECISION IN THE 
PROGRAMME TOMORROW AND THE NO 
FRILLS AIRLINE AIRLINE RYANAIR IS 
TO BE INVESTIGATED BY THE OFFICE OF 
FAIR TRADING AFTER A STRING OF 
COMPLAINTS BY THE ADVERTISING 
WATCHDOG THE ADVERTISING STANDARDS 
AUTHORITY SAYS THE AIRLINE HAD 
PERSISTENTLY MISLED PEOPLE BY 
MAKING EXAGGERATED CLAIMS ABOUT THE 
AVAILABILITY OF CHEAP FLIGHTS AND 
RYANAIR IN TURN ACCUSES THE A. S. A. OF 
BEING BIASED AGAINST IT 
H. S. B. C. THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST BANK 
IS OFFERING TO MATCH THE FIXED RATE 
MORTGAGE DEALS OF CUSTOMERS WHOSE 
DEALS WITH OTHER LENDERS ARE COMING 
TO AN END HOWEVER THERE ARE 
CONDITIONS THERE MUST BE TWENTY PER CENT 
EQUITY IN THE PROPERTY AND THERE 
WILL BE A FEE RAY BOULGER IS FROM 
MORTGAGE BROKERS JOHN CHARCOAL 
KNOWS HIS WAY AROUND THESE OFFERS 
THOSE AREN'T THE ONLY CATCHES ARE 
THERE THERE IS TALK ABOUT THE 
MAXIMUM THEY'LL LEND YOU AND YOU 
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR 
CURRENT ACCOUNT 
THE MAXIMUM LOAN 
IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND ALTHOUGH THEY 
DIDN'T MAKE THIS CLEAR IN THEIR 
PRESS RELEASE THEY ALSO REQUIRE 
YOU TO TRANSFER YOUR CURRENT 
ACCOUNT TO THEM THE AMOUNT OF THE 
FEE WILL BE ANYWHERE BETWEEN SIX HUNDRED 
FIVE THOUSAND THAT WOULD DEPEND ON THE 
INTEREST RATE AND THE SIZE OF YOUR 
MORTGAGE THE LOWEST RATE THEY'LL 
OFFER IS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR PER CENT SO SOMEBODY WHO IS 
COMING OFF A FIXED RATE DEAL WITH A 
MORTGAGE CHEAPER THAN THAT COULD 
GET FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR OTHERWISE THEY'LL MATCH 
THE RATE YOU'VE GOT 
WE'RE STILL IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE SURPRISED 
THAT H. S. B. C. COME FROM THERE IN FACT 
A SUBSIDIARY OF H. S. B. C. HAD TO SUSPEND 
IT BECAUSE OF THE POPULARITY ARE 
THEY NOT GOING TO SHOOT THEMSELVES 
IN THE FOOT 
I THINK THEY'RE 
GEARING UP FOR THAT THEY SAID THEY 
HAVE HAD THREE TIMES AS MANY 
INQUIRIES AS NORMAL ONE OF OUR 
STAFF CALLED THEM AT NINE HUNDRED FIFTEEN AND HAD 
TO HOLD ON FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE HE GOT 
AN ANSWERS AND THEN ESTABLISHED 
SOME FACTS ONE OF OUR BANKING 
INVESTMENT CLIENTS SAYS THEY'RE 
ONLY LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT SORT OF 
CLIENT SO THEY'RE GOING TO CHERRY 
PICK 
WE HAVE SEEN NORTHERN ROCK PICK WE HAVE SEEN MORTGAGE LENDERS 
HAVING TROUBLE WITH OTHER MEMBERS 
AND THEY'RE GRABBING QUALITY 
CUSTOMERS 
H. S. B. C. ARE IN A GOOD CUSTOMERS POSITION TO DO THAT THEY CURRENTLY 
IS ONLY HAVE THREE PER CENT OF THE MARKET WHICH 
IS WELL UNDER PAR BEARING IN MIND 
THEY'RE OUR BIGGEST BANK BECAUSE 
THEY DON'T RELY ON THE WHOLESALE 
MONEY MARKETS FOR FUNDING FOR 
MORTGAGES WHICH MOST OTHER LENDERS 
DO TO SOME EXTENT THEY DON'T HAVE 
ANY FUNDING ISSUES THEY GET A LOT 
OF DEPOSITS FROM THEIR FAR EAST 
CLIENTS THEY'RE IN A STRONG 
POSITION TO GO INTO THE MARKET AND 
PICK WHAT CLIENTS THEY WANT WHEN 
OTHER LENDERS ARE CASH STRAPPED AND 
THEREFORE CAN'T RETALIATE 
THERE IS 
A SHORT TIME LIMIT ON THE OFF 
ISN'T THERE FIVE WEEKS IS IT 
SOMETHING THEY MIGHT REPEAT IF IT 
IS SUCCESSFUL 
THEY HAVE BEEN 
OFFERING A SIMILAR DEAL FOR 
EXISTING H. S. B. C. CUSTOMERS FOR THE 
LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS THAT DEAL 
ACTUALLY IS SLIGHTLY WIDER THAN 
THIS BECAUSE THEY CAN CHOOSE 
BETWEEN A TWO THREE OR FIVE YEAR 
FIXED RATE AND THEY'LL ACCEPT UP TO 
NINETY PER CENT LOAN TO VALUE YES THEY MIGHT 
REPEAT IT AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE 
SAYING IT'S ONLY FOR PEOPLE WITH A 
FIXED RATE NOT ENDING LATER THAN 
JUNE THIRTIETH CERTAINLY ONE THING PEOPLE 
MUST THINK OF WHEN THEY'RE COMING 
TO THE END OF A MORTGAGE DEAL WHAT 
DEAL THEY WANT 
IS FIXED THE RIGHT 
THING 
THAT'S THE KEY QUESTION THING WE'RE ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO GET 
A BANK RATE CUT TOMORROW PROBABLY 
GOING TO SEE MORE LATER IN THE YEAR 
THE WORSE THE ECONOMY GETS THE 
MORE THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS LIKELY 
TO CUT BANK RATES L. THINK THE 
LIKELIHOOD IS THAT TRACKER RATES 
WILL PROVE CHEAPER OVER THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF YEARS HAVING SAID THAT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO LIKE THE 
SECURITY OF A FIXED RATE SO IT'S 
NOT AS IF ONE DEAL IS GOING TO BE 
BEST FOR EVERYBODY PEOPLE NEED TO 
MAKE UP THEIR OWN MIND ON THAT 
WHEN THEY COME TO THE END OF A DEAL 
BEARING IN MIND THAT H. S. B. C. WILL ONLY 
LOOK AT PEOPLE WHOSE DEAL IS 
FINISHING AT THE END OF JUNE THAT 
MEANS BECAUSE WE'RE ADVISING PEOPLE 
NOW TO GET THEIR MORTGAGE OFFER 
LINED UP WELL IN ADVANCE BECAUSE OF 
THE WAY THE MARKET IS GOING A LOT 
OF PEOPLE WON'T QUALIFY FOR THIS 
BUT FOR THOSE WHO DO WELL WORTH 
GETTING A QUOTE IF H. S. B. C. BUT MAKING 
SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE 
RESTRICTIONS IT IN PLACE NOW RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE THERE IS A BIT OF A DELAY 
BEFORE YOU CAN GET IT 
WHAT THEY 
HAVE SAID IS IT'S AVAILABLE FROM 
NEXT MONDAY HOWEVER THEY'RE NOT 
ACCEPTING OFFERS FROM NON CUSTOMERS 
UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MONDAY ALSO 
YOU HAVE TO PAY THE ARRANGEMENT FEE 
UP FRONT IT'S A BOOKING FEE IT 
COULD BE AS MUCH AS FIVE THOUSAND IF YOU 
DON'T GO AHEAD WITH THE MORTGAGE 
YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET 
THAT BACK 
RAY BOULGER THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US 
YOUR TUMMY IS RUMBLING ARE YOU 
GOING TO TELL ME WHY DIDN'T YOU 
HEAR IT 
NO 
I DIDN'T HEAR IT AM HUNGRY I GET YOUR JOKE NOW SORRY HUNGRY FOOD GLORIOUS FOOD THAT'S WHAT 
RESCUES THE PUB GROUPS LET ME 
CHUCK THOSE DOWN THERE SALES OF 
FOOD HELPED THE PUB GROUP MITCHELLS 
AND AMP BUTLERS THE COMPANY HAS BEEN 
UNDER PRESSURE RECENTLY LET'S HAVE 
A LOOK AT THE PIGGURES 
FIGURES THAT'S BASICALLY IN THE 
FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THEIR FINANCIAL 
YEAR YEAR FOLLOWING GROWTH IN FOOD SALES 
DOING VERY WELL OVER THE SAME 
PERIOD UP FOUR POINTS ALMOST FIVE PER CENT 
THERE IF YOU HAD A LOOK AT THEIR 
DRINKS BUSINESS OVERALL LIKE FOR 
LIKE REVENUE IN THE DRINKS BUSINESS 
DIDN'T RISE BY FOUR OR FIVE PER CENT IT WAS DOWN 
BY ALMOST FIFTEEN PER CENT THE GROUP SAID FOOD 
NOW ACCOUNTS FOR THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT OF SALES BEER 
ACCOUNTS FOR TWENTY FIVE PER CENT SO IF A PUB SELLS 
MORE FOOD THAN BEER IS IT A PUB OR 
NOT L. CAN TELL YOU THE SHARES 
REALLY REALLY HAVING A TOUGH TIME 
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED THIS TAKES 
THEM BACK TWELVE MONTHS NINE AT THE TOP 
TWO AT THE BOTTOM WE'RE HOVERING 
AROUND THAT THREE MARKET IF WE HAVE A 
LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON NOW THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX 
DOWN TWO P. A SMALL FALL TODAY BUT IT 
REALLY HAS FALLEN OUT OF BED OVER 
THE PAST YEAR WEATHER SPOON'S 
HAVING A NICE DAY CAST OUR NET 
WIDER OVER THE WIDELY HELD SHARES 
YOU TAKE YOUR PICK HALF ARE UP AND 
HALF ARE DOWN WE'LL SEE HOW THAT 
AFFECTS THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IN A SECOND 
THE FIGURE HERE CAME IN A BIT BELOW 
EXPECTATIONS THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE 
OF DISTRIBUTION PROBLEMS TOWARDS 
THE END OF LAST YEAR COULDN'T GET 
THEIR PRODUCTS OUT IT'S CURRENTLY 
IN TAKEOVER TALKS WITH TWO 
COMPANIES PRETAX PROFITS SEVEN POINT NINE 
MILLION SHARES UNCHANGED TODAY 
SIGNET ON THE OTHER HAND IS THE 
WORLD'S BIGGEST JEWELLERY RETAILOR 
STERLING EQUIVALENT OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE MILLION 
POUNDS REPORTS IN DOLLARS A 
MASSIVE AMERICAN BUSINESS THAT'S 
DOWN L. MEAN DOWN ALMOST SEVENTEEN PER CENT AND 
IT SAID THE OUTLOOK REMAINS 
CHALLENGING NONETHELESS LOOK WHAT 
HAPPENED TO ITS SHARES I MEAN A 
REALLY GOOD PERFORMANCE TODAY HBOS 
SHARES ARE DOWN AS ARE IN FACT 
MANY OF THE BANKS I HAVE TO TELL 
YOU LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT WHERE THE 
F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IS IT'S UP TWENTY ONE POINTS 
IT'S SURPRISING BECAUSE A LOT OF 
SHARES ARE DOWN THE ECONOMIC 
EXPERTS FROM THE I. M. F. CLAIM THE 
CHANCELLOR IS WRONG AND HE'S TOO 
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE OUTLOOK FOR 
THE U. K. ECONOMY HOWEVER 
THE 
CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING HAS 
INSISTED THIS MORNING THAT BRITAIN 
HAS A RESILIENT ECONOMY AND HAS 
DEFENDED HIS GROWTH FORECAST FOR 
THE U. K. THE I. M. F. THEY'RE GOING TO 
RELEASE WORLD ECONOMIC FORECAST 
LATER TODAY IN WHICH THEY'RE 
EXPECTED TO SAY THAT THE WORLD 
ECONOMY WILL GROW MUCH MORE SLOWLY 
THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT STEVEN 
BELL IS A CHIEF ECONOMIST WITH THE 
HEDGE FUND GLC HOW WORRIED SHOULD 
WE BE BY THIS REVISION TO THE 
FORECAST AND THE FACT CHANCELLOR 
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING 
ABOUT 
THE I. M. F. WOULD SAY THAT BUT THEY 
ARE CUTTING THEIR NUMBERS THE 
OUTLOOK FOR THAT PERIOD FOR THE 
U. K. DETERIORATE BY THE DAY IN THE 
FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THE YEAR THE 
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR WASN'T DOING 
BADLY BUT YOU HAVE JUST BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT MITCHELLS AND AMP BUTLERS 
SELLING MORE FOOD BUT DRINKS SALES 
ARE GOING DOWN THEIR SHARE PRICE 
HAS COLLAPSED THE HOUSING MARKET 
IS WEAK THINK WHEN WE GET THE 
RETAIL SPENDING FIGURES FOR MARCH 
WHICH INCLUDED EASTER A HORRIBLE 
MONTH HORRIBLE EASTER NORMALLY A 
BIG SPENDING MONTH IT WILL BE 
VERY BAD MONTH EITHER MARCH OR 
APRIL WILL SHOW A TUMBLE IN THE 
OFFICIAL FIGURES THE HOUSING 
MARKET WILL EACH DAY WEEK EUROPE 
IS DOING BETTER BUT THAT IS 
LARGELY BECAUSE OF ITS EXPORTS 
THE MARKET WILL STAY WEEK WE KNOW 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND ALMOST 
CERTAINLY ARE GOING TO CUT RATES 
TOMORROW LET'S HOPE THEY GO ON 
CUTTING RATES WHAT IS STOPPING 
THEM IS NOT THAT THEY THINK THE 
ECONOMY IS GREAT BUT BECAUSE 
INFLATION IS A PROBLEM WE HAVE THE 
WORST COMBINATION OF RISING 
INFLATION AND FALLING GROWTH THAT 
WE HAVE HAD FOR FIFTEEN YEARS 
YOU ARE 
TALKING ABOUT A BAD OUTLOOK FOR THE 
U. K. ECONOMY MOST PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
THAT ONLY YESTERDAY TERRIBLE 
TIMES IN THE HOUSING MARKET AND IT 
HOUSE PRICES OVER THE YEAR ARE 
STILL RISING THIS ECONOMY IS STILL 
GROWING AND NOT IN RECESSION WHY 
BE DOWNHEARTED 
HOUSE PRICES MAY 
HAVE BEEN UP A SMIDGEN COMPARED 
WITH LAST YEAR BUT EVEN THE 
HALIFAX FIGURES THIS MONTH WAS 
LOWER THAN A YEAR AGO EVERYTHING 
WAS FINE UNTIL AUGUST AND THEN NOT 
ONLY DID THIS SUMMER END BUT THE 
BOOM ENDED THE OVERALL PACE OF 
PACE PACE OF GROWTH HAS BEEN 
SLOWING GRADUALLY AND STEADILY WE 
MAY FALL OFF A BIT OF A CLIFF L. 
DON'T BELIEVE WE ARE HEADING FOR 
SURE FOR RECESSION OR A DEEP ONE 
BUT WE WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL 
CHANGE FROM THE FIFTEEN YEARS OF 
UNINTERRUPTED GROWTH WE HAVE HAD 
THAT PERIOD IS OVER WHAT WHAT DIFFERENCE 
DO S. 
THAT MAKE TO 
VIEWERS OF THIS PROGRAMME IF WE DO 
SLIDE INTO SOMETHING WE CALL A 
RECESSION DO YOU SEE MASS 
UNEMPLOYMENT PEOPLE OUT OF WORK 
NOT ABLE TO AFFORD THINGS 
IT IS 
NOT MASS UNEMPLOYMENT BUT IT DOES 
MEAN IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB 
IT IS TOUGHER TO FIND ONE IF YOU 
LOSE YOUR JOB YOU ARE OUT OF WORK 
FOR LONGER COMPANIES WILL BE LESS 
WILLING TO GIVE PAY RISES THE 
GOVERNMENT IS ALREADY LESS GENEROUS 
WITH PUBLIC SECTOR RISES THE WHOLE 
MORTGAGE MARKET IT IS MORE 
DIFFICULT TO GET A MORTGAGE AS YOU 
HAVE DISCUSSED THIS H. S. B. C. OFFER IS 
GREAT BUT IT IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE 
WITH TWENTY PER CENT CASH OR EQUITY IN THEIR 
HOUSE IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BUY A 
HOUSE THAT IS GOING TO GET HARDER 
THANK YOU 
I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT 
SOMETHING NEW WHICH WILL BE 
APPEARING ON THE WEBSITE IT IS 
ALREADY THERE IN PART WE ARE 
LAUNCHING A REGULAR REVIEW OF 
PERSONAL FINANCE BOOKS IF YOU HAVE 
A FAVOURITE ONE ABOUT INVESTMENTS 
OR ONE WHICH YOU THINK IS SO 
ABSOLUTELY AWFUL THE NATION NEEDS 
TO BE WARNED OFF IT E. MAILED ME 
WITH YOUR SUGGESTIONS 
CLICK ON THE ADAM'S READS SECTION 
WE WILL BE RUNNING THAT AS A 
MONTHLY REVIEW ONLINE AND ON AIR 
KEEP WATCHING FOR ALLAN LEIGHTON IN 
A FEW MINUTES FIRST WE HAVE HEARD 
ABOUT THE THREAT TO HOMES AND 
COMMUNITIES ALONG THE EAST ANGLIAN 
COAST CAUSED BY RISING SEA LEVELS 
AND CRUMBLING DEFENCES TODAY ROBB 
HAS BEEN TAKING CLOSE LOOK AT HOW 
COUNCILS ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND THE 
MONEY TO PAY FOR REPAIRS 
IT IS A WONDERFUL VIEW BUT FOR HOW 
MUCH LONGER ALL ALONG THIS COAST 
LINE AND MUCH OF BRITAIN'S EAST AND 
SOUTHERN SHORES THE SEA IS 
ADVANCING RISING SEA LEVELS ARE 
ADDING TO THE PROBLEM IN NORTH 
NORFOLK PETER FREW IS IN CHARGE OF 
HANDLING THE COUNCIL'S RESPONSE A A GOOD BEACH IS PROBABLY THE BEST 
DEFENCE YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD LONG 
BEACH BACKED WITH DUNES OR 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THAT TAKES THE 
FORCE OF THE WAVES 
IT DOES BUT WE 
TENDED TO SAY WE HAVEN'T GOT LONG 
BEACHES AND WE TENDED TO HAVE TO 
BUILD DEFENCES 
WHAT IS HAPPENING 
OVER HERE 
THIS IS A WALL THAT WAS 
BUILT AFTER THE NINETEEN FIFTY THREE FLOODS WE 
HAVE A DEEP HARRIS IT IS SEVEN 
METRES DEEP A DEEP TERRACE THEN 
YOU HAVE STEPS AND A WAVE RETURN 
WALL WHICH WILL HOPEFULLY IN MOST 
CASES STOP THE CARAVANS AT THE TOP 
FROM BEING DAMAGED IN ALL BUT THE 
MOST SEVERE STORMS 
AT THIS STRETCH 
NEAR WALLCOTT SEA DEFENCES ARE 
BEING MAINTAINED BUT IT IS A 
PATCHWORK REPAIR FOUR PATCHWORK 
POLICY THE LOCAL COUNCIL HAS TO 
BALANCE THE COST OF MAINTAINING SEA 
WALLS AGAINST A LIMITED BUDGET WITH 
LITTLE OR NO HELP FROM THIS 
GOVERNMENT 
I HAVE FORTY THREE KILOMETRES OF GOVERNMENT COASTLINE TO MANAGE L. HAVE 
CURRENTLY GOT A BUDGET OF ABOUT 
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR TO MAINTAIN THESE 
DEFENCES IT IS NORMALLY ABOUT 
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BUT IN THIS INSTANCE THE 
COUNCIL IS GIVING ME OVER TEN YEARS 
AN EXTRA TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR TO DO THIS 
ADDITIONAL WORK BECAUSE WE CAN'T 
GET GRANT AID FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
AT THE MOMENT 
BUT PRESUMABLY AS 
HOUSES ARE FALLING INTO THE SEA 
THAT MONEY IS NOT ENOUGH 
IT IS NOT 
WE ARE RELIANT IN TERMS OF BUILDING 
NEW DEFENCES OR REBUILDING OLD 
ONES WE ARE RELIANT ON GRANT AID 
FROM CENTRAL GOVERNMENT THERE IS A 
FAIRLY LARGE POT BUT IT DOESN'T DO 
ANYTHING LIKE FAR ENOUGH WE ARE 
COMPETING IF YOU PUT IT THAT WAY 
WITH ALL THE SCHEMES IN ENGLAND FOR 
FLOOD AND COAST DEFENCE BOTH ON 
THE COAST AND INLAND AND SO WE 
HAVE TO JUSTIFY TO GOVERNMENT WHEN 
WE WANT A SCHEME WE HAVE TO 
JUSTIFY WHETHER WE CAN GET THE 
GRANT AID OR NOT IT IS DIFFICULT 
THREE YEARS AGO GOVERNMENT POLICY 
CHANGED AFTER DECADES OF TRYING TO 
SHORE UP SEA DEFENCES IT DECIDED 
THE TASK WAS TOO BIG AND DEFENSIVE 
EXPENSIVE THE ADVICE IS NOW THAT 
ON MANY PARTS OF THE CLOSED NATURE 
SHOULD TAKE ITS COURSE EARLIER 
THIS WEEK WE SAW WHAT THAT COULD 
MEAN A FEW MILES DOWN THE COAST 
HOMES AND CARAVANS HAVE FALLEN INTO 
THE SEA AND OTHER HOUSES HAVE BEEN 
ABANDONED HOMEOWNERS GET NO 
COMPENSATION FOR THIS EVEN THOUGH 
WHEN THEY BOUGHT THEIR HOUSES THE 
POLICY WAS TO MAINTAIN SEA DEFENCES 
SO THEY THOUGHT THEIR HOMES WOULD 
BE SAFE ON THIS COAST FOURTEEN HUNDRED HOMES 
COULD BE IN DANGER WITH THE LOSS 
OF BEACHES AND CLIFFS AFFECTING 
TOURISM 
WE HAVE HAD ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OF TOURISM SAYING WE MUST DEFEND L. THINK WE 
ARE NOW BEGINNING TO REALISE THAT 
IS NOT IN ALL CASES THE RIGHT 
SOLUTION THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT 
EMERGED FROM THE SHORELINE 
MANAGEMENT PLAN WE DID ON THIS 
COAST WHICH CAME OUT IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
THERE WAS A SUGGESTION THAT 
SIGNIFICANT LENGTHS OF THE COAST 
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO RETREAT AND 
THE COAST BEHAVE NATURALLY BUT 
WHAT WE HAVEN'T GOT YET IS SOME 
FORM OF NATIONAL POLICY THAT WILL 
ALLOW THAT CHANGE TO TAKE PLACE L. 
THINK WHAT HAS TO BE REALISED IS 
THAT NOT DEFENDING SOMEWHERE HAS A 
COST IT HAS QUITE A HIGH COST 
BOTH IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU DO WITH 
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED WHAT 
YOU DO WITH THE COMMUNITIES WOULD 
YOU DO WITH DERELICT DEFENCES 
WHAT YOU DO WITH DERELICT DEFENCES 
IT IS MY STRONG VIEW THAT MANAGED 
RETREAT OR NO ACT OF INTERVENTION 
THE TWO POLICIES THAT HAVE CAUSED 
SO MUCH CONCERN ARE NOT 
NECESSARILY LOW COST OPTIONS PETER PETER BELIEVES THE ISSUE IS NOW RISING UP 
THE POLITICAL AGENDA HE SITS ON A 
GOVERNMENT BODY SET UP TO LOOK INTO 
THE PROBLEM AND WANT MORE MONEY 
MADE AVAILABLE FOR SEA DEFENCES AND 
TO HELP HOMEOWNERS AND COMMUNITIES 
ADAPT TO THE CHANGES BUT IT IS 
SLOW PROCESS IN THE MEANTIME THE 
SEA WILL CONTINUE TO EAT AWAY AT 
THE COAST LINE 
WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BE A GREAT 
BUSINESS LEADER ONE PERSON WHO HAS 
HAD A STAB AT ANSWERING THAT 
QUESTION IS ALLAN LEIGHTON AUTHOR 
OF A NEW BOOK CALLED ON LEADERSHIP 
HE IS BETTER KNOWN AS THE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE ROYAL MAIL HE IS ALSO THE 
CHAIRMAN OF SELFRIDGES DEPUTY 
CHAIRMAN OF CANADIAN FOOD GROUP 
GEORGE WESTON AND A MEMBER OF THE 
BOARD OF B. SKY B. IN THE FEW SPARE 
MINUTES HE HAS LAST HAS LEFT AT 
THREE A M. HE HAS INTERVIEWED SOME OF 
BRITAIN'S TOP BOSSES ABOUT THEIR 
VIEWS OF WHAT MAKES TOP LEADER 
FOR HIS LATEST BOOK WELCOME THANK THANK YOU 
THAT IS ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE BOOK HAS 
BEEN OUT FOR SOME TIME YOU SPOKE 
TO SOME OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL 
BUSINESS LEADERS YOU WERE TALKING 
ABOUT THEIR LEADERSHIP TIPS WE 
HAVE GATHERED A FEW HEADINGS WE 
HAVE CALLED THEM LLEYTON'S LAWS AT 
THE BEGINNING STARTING A BUSINESS 
IS A NIGHTMARE YOU SAID IT IS EASY 
IT SOMETIMES TO RAISE ONE HUNDRED MILLION 
THAN ONE MILLION 
IT CERTAINLY WAS 
IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY A BUSINESS 
AND YOU ARE KNOWN IN BUSINESS OR 
YOU ALREADY HAVE THE COMPANY AT 
WANT TO RAISE SOME MONEY TO MAKE A 
BIG ACQUISITION THAT IS OFTEN MUCH 
EASIER TO DO THAN IT IS IF YOU ARE 
STARTING THE BUSINESS UP 
HOW DO 
YOU GET ROUND IT 
IT IS THE SAME 
OLD STORY MOST OF THE PEOPLE I 
KNOW WHO STARTED THEIR BUSINESSES 
WENT TWO OR THREE WAYS THEY EITHER 
HAD A FRIENDLY BANK MANAGER GOOD 
FRIENDS OR THEY RAIDED FRIENDS AND 
FAMILY GENERALLY IT IS ALL THREE 
PARENTS AND FAMILY 
WE HAVE TAKEN 
SOME OF THESE PEARLS OF WISDOM 
GETTING STARTED LET'S GO THROUGH 
ALL OF THEM PICK WHICH YOU THINK 
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
BUILDING THE TEAM IS VERY IMPORTANT 
NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE EVEN IF YOU 
ARE SMALL YOU START OFF ON YOUR 
OWN AN ENTREPRENEUR ENTREPRENEUR 
THERE IS ALWAYS FOUR OR FIVE PEOPLE 
IN THE BUSINESS WITH TWO TO THREE THOUSAND 
PEOPLE OR SMALL BUSINESS YOU NEED 
TEAM OF PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO 
EVERYTHING YOURSELF BUILDING A 
TEAM GETTING THE RIGHT CHEMISTRY 
AND SKILLS AND GETTING THAT 
COMBINATION IS IMPORTANT THAT THAT MOVES THROUGH TO COMMUNICATION L. L. 
WAS FASCINATED ABOUT THAT L. TOOK 
TIME AWAY FROM JOURNALISM AND RUN 
THE TEAM AND IT WAS A NIGHTMARE L. 
SPENT HALF MY TIME BEING A HUMAN 
RESOURCES DIRECTOR A DOCTOR AND 
MARRIAGE GUIDANCE COUNSELLOR 
NOBODY PREPARES YOU FOR IT CAN YOU 
PREPARE BE CALLED TO BE LEADERS 
THEY USED TO SAY THAT LEADERS WERE 
BORN AND THAT USED TO BE THE CASE 
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE 
PEOPLE IN THE BOOK IF YOU LOOK AT 
THEM THEY ALL DO THE SAME THING 
THEY ARE ALL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
CHARACTERS BUT THEY ALL SHARE THEY 
DO THINGS THE SAME WAY BUT IN THE 
DIFFERENT STYLE THAT IS THE BIG 
DEAL THE REASON I WROTE THE BOOK 
APART FROM TRYING TO RAISE A LOT OF 
MONEY FOR BREAST CANCER CARE WAS I 
RAISED SO MANY BUSINESS BOOKS AND 
LEADERSHIP BOOKS THEY HAVE MADE IT 
A SCIENCE I READ SO MANY THEY 
GIVE IT STUPID TITLE THEN YOU 
READ IT THREE HUNDRED PAGES AND YOU THINK 
I HAVE NO CHANCE BUT THE PEOPLE 
YOU TALK TO THEY SAY IT IS 
GENERALLY COMMON SENSE 
A CRITICISM 
OF THESE LAWS IS THAT IN THE WAY 
THEY ARE SORT OF OBVIOUS DO YOU 
THINK IN THE END IT COMES DOWN TO 
THAT TO BE A LEADER YOU HAVE TO 
HAVE GOOD PEOPLE KNOW WHAT YOU ARE 
DOING BE NICE TO THEM AND HAVE A 
GOAL 
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO GOAL BE NICE TO STOP THE REALLY GOOD 
LEADERS GET A LOT FROM THEIR PEOPLE 
AND OF VERY GOOD FROM THEIR PEOPLE 
BUT THEY ARE DEMANDING TOO IT IS 
STATING THE OBVIOUS IN A STRANGE 
WAY THAT IS GOOD WHAT EVERYBODY 
IS TRYING TO DO IS MAKE IT TOO 
COMPLICATED YOU GET YOURSELF 
STARTED DECIDE WHAT YOU ARE GOING 
TO BE CALLED GET SOME PEOPLE TO 
HELP YOU OUT TALK WITH THEM 
COMMUNICATION ISN'T JUST 
PRESENTATIONS IT IS TALKING WITH 
PEOPLE NOT AT THEM AND KEEP GOING 
COMPLETING THE CIRCLE THAT IS 
OFTEN THE HARDEST TEAM THE
