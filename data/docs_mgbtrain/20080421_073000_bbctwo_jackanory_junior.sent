BUT IT COULD NOT GET INTO THE MOUSEHOLE 
THIS IS JACKANORY JUNIOR 
HELLO I'M SHOBNA 
THIS IS THE STORY OF A CAT CALLED MOWZER 
AND THE GREAT ADVENTURE SHE HAD ONE DARK AND STORMY NIGHT 
AT THE FAR END OF ENGLAND 
A LAND OF ROCKS AND MOORLAND 
STRETCHES OUT INTO A A BLUE GREEN SEA 
BETWEEN ITS HEADLANDS LIE TINY HARBOURS 
WHERE THE FISHING BOATS HIDE WHEN STORMS ARE BLOWING 
ONE OF THESE HARBOURS IS SO SMALL 
AND THE ENTRANCE BETWEEN ITS STONE BREAKWATERS IS SO NARROW 
THAT THE FISHERMAN CALL IT THE MOUSEHOLE 
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED AROUND THE HARBOUR GREW FOND OF THE NAME 
AND THEY CALL THEIR VILLAGE MOUSEHOLE TO THIS DAY 
THEY SAY IT THE CORNISH WAY MOWZEL 
BUT YOU MAY SAY IT AS YOU CHOOSE 
ONCE THERE LIVED IN THE VILLAGE A CAT WHOSE NAME WAS MOWZER 
SHE HAD A COTTAGE WITH A WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE HARBOUR 
AN OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH PATCHWORK CUSHIONS 
AND AN OLD FISHERMAN CALLED TOM 
MOWZER HAD HAD MANY KITTENS IN HER TIME 
BUT THEY'D GROWN UP AND LEFT HOME 
HER ELDEST SON KEPT THE INN ON THE QUAYSIDE 
IT WAS NOISY AND SMOKEY 
HIS MAN HAD ONCE SPILLED BEER ON MOWZER'S HEAD WHILE DRAWING A PINT 
SO SHE DID NOT GO THERE VERY OFTEN 
ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS KEPT THE SHOP ON THE CORNER 
IT WAS BUSY AND CROWDED 
HER LADY ONCE STEPPED ON MOWZER'S TAIL 
WHEN SHE WAS WEIGHING OUT VEGETABLES 
SO SHE DID NOT GO THERE VERY OFTEN EITHER 
MOWZER FELT HER CHILDREN HAD NOT TRAINED THEIR PEOPLE PROPERLY 
HER PET OLD TOM WAS VERY WELL BEHAVED 
HE NEVER SPILLED THE CREAM WHEN HE WAS FILLING HER SAUCER 
HE ALWAYS STOKED THE RANGE TO A BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN GLOW 
HE ROCKED THE ROCKING CHAIR AT THE RIGHT SPEED 
HE KNEW THE EXACT SPOT BEHIND HER LEFT EAR 
WHERE MOWZER LIKE TO BE TICKLED 
AND HE NEVER WASTED TIME DRAWING BEER OR WEIGHING VEGETABLES 
WHEN HE WAS NOT LOOKING AFTER MOWZER 
HE PASSED THE DAY IN THE MOST USEFUL WAY 
HE TOOK HIS LITTLE BOAT 
THROUGH THE NARROW OPENING BETWEEN THE BREAKWATERS 
OUT INTO THE BLUE GREEN SEA 
AND CAUGHT FISH FOR MOWZER'S DINNER 
MOWZER WAS VERY PARTIAL TO A PLATE OF FRESH FISH 
SHE NEVER ATE ANYTHING ELSE 
SO ON MONDAYS THEY MADE MORGY BROTH 
MOWZER'S FAVOURITE FISH STEW 
ON TUESDAYS THEY BAKED HAKE AND TOPPED IT WITH MASHED POTATOES 
ON WEDNESDAYS THEY COOKED KEDGEREE WITH DELICIOUS SMOKED LING 
AND ON THURSDAYS THEY GRILL FAIRMAIDS A MOUTH WATERING MEAL 
ON FRIDAYS THEY FRIED LAUNCES 
WITH A KNOB OF BUTTER AND A SQUEEZE OF LEMON 
ON SATURDAYS THEY SOUSED SCAD WITH VINEGAR AND ONIONS 
AND ON SUNDAYS THEY MADE STAR GAZY PIE 
WITH PRIME PILCHARDS IN PASTRY 
ALL IN ALL MOWZER'S DAYS PASSED VERY PLEASANTLY 
THEN ONE YEAR THERE CAME A TERRIBLE WINTER 
AT THE FAR END OF ENGLAND THE BLUE GREEN SEA 
TURNED GREY AND BLACK 
THE GREAT STORM CAT IS STIRRING THOUGHT MOWZER 
AS SHE WATCHED AT HER WINDOW 
THE WIND WHINED LIKE A WILD THING ABOUT THE HEADLANDS 
IT CAME HUNTING THE FISHING BOATS IN THEIR HIDDEN HARBOURS 
WHEN A GREAT STORM CAT IS HOWLING THOUGHT MOWZER 
IT'S BEST TO STAY SNUG AND INDOORS BY A FRIENDLY FIRE 
THE SEA DREW ITSELF UP INTO GIANT WAVES 
AND FLUNG ITSELF AGAINST THE BREAKWATERS 
ALL ALONG THE COAST OF CORNWALL 
THE STONE WALL STOOD THE SHOCK 
THEN THE SEA SUCKED UP ITS STRENGTH AND ROARED OVER THEM 
SINKING THE SAILING BOATS IN THEIR HOME HAVENS 
BUT IT COULD NOT GET INTO THE MOUSEHOLE 
MOWZER WATCHED AS THE GREAT STORM CAT CLAWED WITH HIS CAT'S PAW 
THROUGH A GAP IN THE HARBOUR WALL 
BUT IT WAS TOO SMALL 
HE SNARLED AND LEAPED UP AT THE BREAKWATER UNDER THE LOWERING SKY 
BUT IT WAS TOO HIGH 
THE FISHING BOAT SAT SAFE AS MICE IN THEIR OWN MOUSEHOLE 
BUT THEY COULD NOT GET OUT 
AND BECAUSE THE FISHERMAN COULD NOT FISH THERE WAS NO FOOD 
THEY ATE UP THE FEW VEGETABLES LEFT IN THEIR STORM RACKED GARDENS 
THEY ATE UP THE SALTED PILCHARDS IN THEIR CELLARS 
MOWZER HATED VEGETABLES 
AND THE PILCHARDS WERE TOO SALTY FOR HER TASTE 
SOON THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT 
THE CATS AND THEIR PEOPLE GREW HUNGRY 
MOWZER SAT BY HER WINDOW 
STARING OUT AT THE STORM 
AND THOUGHT LONGINGLY OF MORGY BROTH 
AND STAR GAZY PIE 
EVERY DAY THE FISHERMEN GATHERED ON THE QUAYSIDE 
SOMETIMES THEY'D TRY AND TAKE A BOAT OUT THROUGH THE MOUSEHOLE 
BUT ALWAYS THE GREAT STORM CAT LAY IN WAIT FOR THEM 
AND THEY WERE LUCKY TO ESCAPE WITH THEIR LIVES 
THEN AT LAST ONE EVENING 
AS OLD TOM SAT WITH MOWZER ON HIS KNEE 
SHE FELT HIM TAKE A DEEP SIGH 
MOWZER IT'LL SOON BE CHRISTMAS AND NO MAN CAN STAND BY AT CHRISTMAS 
AND SEE THE CHILDREN STARVE 
SOMEONE MUST GO FISHING 
COME WHAT MAY AND I THINK IT MUST BE ME 
IT CANNOT BE THE YOUNG MEN THEY HAVE WIVES AND CHILDREN 
AND MOTHERS TO WEEP FOR THEM IF THEY DO NOT RETURN 
BUT MY WIFE AND PARENTS ARE DEAD 
AND MY CHILDREN ARE GROWN AND GONE 
MOWZER PURRED TO TELL HIM SHE UNDERSTOOD 
IT WAS THE SAME WITH HER 
I SHALL GO OUT TOMORROW MOWZER 
SAID THE OLD MAN 
AND I SHALL NOT COME BACK WITHOUT A CATCH 
MOWZER PURRED LOUDER TO TELL HIM SHE WOULD GO WITH HIM 
FOR HE WAS ONLY A MAN 
AND MEN WERE LIKE MICE IN THE PAWS OF THE GREAT STORM CAT 
BESIDES SHE KNEW THAT IF HE DID NOT COME BACK 
SHE WOULD NOT MUCH CARE TO LIVE WITHOUT HIM 
THERE WOULD BE NO ONE TO POUR THE CREAM 
OR STOKE UP THE RANGE 
OR ROCK THE ROCKING CHAIR 
THERE'D BE NO ONE IN THE WORLD WHO KNEW WHERE SHE LIKED TO BE TICKLED 
BEHIND HER LEFT EAR 
TOMORROW NIGHT MOWZER HE SAID 
WE SHALL EAT MORGY BROTH BAKED HAKE LING AND LAUNCES FAIRMAID 
SOUSED SCAT AND STAR GAZY PIE 
THE NEXT MORNING THEY SET OUT VERY EARLY 
BEFORE THE OTHERS WERE WAKING 
BEFORE THEY WENT TOM STOKED UP THE OLD RANGE 
DAMPED IT DOWN SO IT WOULD BURN STEADILY UNTIL THEY RETURNED 
THEN HE HUNG A LAMP IN THE WINDOW 
SO THAT IT WOULD SHINE OUT ACROSS THE HARBOUR 
AND LIGHT THEIR WAY 
AS THEY REACHED THE QUAYSIDE 
MOWZER LOOKED BACK THROUGH THE WIND AND RAIN 
AND THOUGHT HOW WELCOMING THE WINDOW LOOKED 
SOON THEIR BOAT WAS CROSSING THE HARBOUR TOWARDS THE MOUSEHOLE GAP 
THE VOICE OF THE STORM CAT ROSE AROUND THEM 
LIKE A GIANT CATERWAULING 
AS SHE LISTENED TO HIS WAILING 
MOWZER FELT A STRANGE SADNESS FOR HIM 
HOW LONELY HE MUST BE ENDLESSLY HUNTING THE MEN MICE IN THE DARKNESS 
AND NEVER RETURNING TO THE ROSY GLOW OF A RED HOT RANGE 
AND HER KIND HEART WAS MOVED TO COMFORT HIM 
MANY A TOMCAT HAD MOWZER TAMED WITH THE SWEETNESS OF HER SINGING 
NOW SHE LIFTED HER HEAD AND SANG LIKE A SIREN 
JOINING HER CALL WITH THE GREAT STORM CAT 
AND SO IT WAS HE WAS TAKEN OFF GUARD 
AS THE BOAT MADE ITS BID FOR FREEDOM 
SOOTHED BY MOWZER'S SERENADE 
THE GREAT STORM CAT PAUSED IN HIS PROWLING 
AND PULLED BACK HIS PAW FOR A MERE MOMENT 
SWIFTLY THE BOAT PASSED THROUGH THE MOUSEHOLE AND INTO THE OPEN SEA 
THEN THE GREAT STORM CAT PLAYED WITH THEM AS A CAT PLAYS WITH A MOUSE 
HE WOULD LET THEM LOOSE AS THEY FOUGHT TOWARDS THE FISHING GROUNDS 
THEN DOWN WOULD COME HIS PAW IN A FLURRY OF FOAM AND WATER 
BUT HE DID NOT STRIKE TO SINK THEM THAT WOULD HAVE SPOILED HIS SPORT 
WHEN THEY REACHED THE FISHING GROUNDS THE SEA WAS SO ROUGH 
THAT IT WAS HARD TO PUT OUT THE NETS 
YOU MUST SING AGAIN MOWZER SAID TOM 
YOUR VOICE SOOTHES THE SEA LIKE THE SIRENS OF OLD 
SO MOWZER SANG AGAIN 
LONGER AND LOUDER THAN SHE HAD EVER SUNG BEFORE 
INDEED OLD TOM WAS FORCED TO BLOCK HIS EARS 
SO HER SONG SHOULD NOT DISTRACT HIM FROM FISHING 
AND AGAIN THE GREAT STORM CAT PAUSED IN HIS PLAY 
AND SANG WITH HER UNTIL THE NETS WERE SAFELY SHOT 
ALL DAY THEY FISHED IN A SEETHING SEA 
THE WAVES WERE SO HIGH 
AND THE CLOUDS SO LOW 
THAT THEY SOON LOST SIGHT OF THE SHORE 
AND ALL THE TIME THE GREAT STORM CAT PLAYED WITH THE BOAT 
STRIKING IT THEN LOSING IT BUT NEVER QUITE SINKING IT 
AND WHENEVER HIS CLAWS GREW TOO SHARP MOWZER WOULD SING TO HIM 
TO SOFTEN HIS ANGER 
AS EVENING CAME DOWN THEY HAULED IN THE NETS 
INTO THE BELLY OF THE BOAT TUMBLED LING AND LAUNCES 
SCAD HAKE AND FAIRMAIDS ENOUGH FISH FOR A CAULDRON OF MORGY BROTH 
ENOUGH PILCHARDS FOR HALF A HUNDRED STAR GAZY PIES 
MOWZER MY HANDSOME WE'RE ALL SAFE SAID OLD TOM 
IF WE CAN BRING THIS HAUL HOME TO HARBOUR 
BUT MOWZER KNEW THE GREAT STORM CAT WOULD STRIKE 
WHEN HE SAW THEM RUN FOR THE MOUSEHOLE 
SHE KNEW THE GAME SERVES TO SHARPEN THE APPETITE OF THE FEAST TO FOLLOW 
IT IS HIS MEAL OR MINE THOUGHT MOWZER 
AS SHE LOOKED AT THE FISH IN THE BELLY OF THE BOAT 
AS SHE THOUGH OF THE MORGY BROTH MURMURING ON THE TOP OF THE RANGE 
THE STAR GAZY PIE GOLDEN IN THE OVEN 
MOWZER BEGAN TO PURR 
HER PURRING ROSE LIKE A HYMN TO HOME 
ABOVE THE NOISE OF THE GREAT STORM CAT'S HOWLING 
SUCH MUSIC HAD NOT REACHED THE EARS OF THE GREAT STORM CAT 
SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME 
FOR WHEN DO CATS PURR IN THE WIND AND DARKNESS 
PUZZLED HE PAUSED IN HIS HOWLING 
BENDING HIS EAR TO CATCH THE STRANGE SOUND 
IT SEEMED TO HIM HE HAD HEARD SUCH A SONG LONG BEFORE 
WHEN HE WAS A STORM KITTEN 
THE GREAT STORM CAT GREW QUIET 
GONE WAS HIS HUNGER FOR HUNTING 
FOR MAKING HIS MEAL OF THE MICE MEN 
ONLY THE PLEASURE OF THE PURRING REMAINED 
THEN THE GREAT STORM CAT BEGAN TO PURR WITH MOWZER 
AND AS THE SOFT SOUND GREW 
THE WINDS WANED AND THE WAVES WEAKENED 
AS THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF HOME 
A STRANGE SIGHT MET THEIR EYES 
THE WHOLE VILLAGE OF MOWZER WAS SHINING WITH LIGHT 
AND LANTERNS GLEAMED ALONG BOTH ARMS OF THE HARBOUR 
WHEN THE PEOPLE OF MOUSEHOLE HAD FOUND OLD TOM'S BOAT MISSING 
AND A LIGHT IN HIS WINDOW 
THEY KNEW HE'D GONE OUT TO FIND FISH FOR THEM 
OR TO PERISH ON THE WATER 
ALL DAY THEY HAD WATCHED AND WAITED STARING INTO THE CLOUDWRACKED SEA 
BUT THEY COULD SEE NO SIGN OF HIM 
WHEN NIGHT FELL THE WOMEN WENT HOME AND SET CANDLES IN THEIR WINDOWS 
AND EVERY MAN WENT DOWN TO THE HARBOUR WALLS 
AS THEY WAITED AND WATCHED 
THEY SAW THE WIND WAS DYING AND THE SEA WAS GROWING CALM 
THE DARK CLOUDS LIFTED 
AND A THIN MOON SHONE OUT BETWEEN THEM 
AND IN THE LIGHT OF THE THIN MOON THEY SAW A SMALL BOAT COMING 
AND BEHIND IT CAME THE SMALLEST TAMEST STORM KITTEN OF A WIND 
AS OLD TOM AND MOWZER CAME THROUGH THE MOUSEHOLE GAP 
A SUDDEN BREEZE CAUGHT THEM 
A TINY PLAYFUL CAT'S PAW LIKE A GESTURE OF FAREWELL 
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF COOKING IN MOUSEHOLE THAT NIGHT 
THE PEOPLE MADE A WHOLE CAULDRON OF MORGY BROTH 
THEY BAKED HAKE COOKED KEDGEREE 
GRILLED FAIRMAIDS FRIED LAUNCES 
SOUSED SCAD 
THEY BAKED HALF A HUNDRED STAR GAZY PIES 
THE PEOPLE AND CATS FEASTED TOGETHER 
UNTIL THE HUNGER WAS NO MORE THAN A MEMORY 
AND EVERY YEAR SINCE THAT DAY 
AT THE INN ON THE QUAYSIDE THE PEOPLE OF MOUSEHOLE 
HOLD A FISH FEAST THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE 
THEY RAISE THEIR GLASSES TO THE MEMORY OF OLD TOM 
AND EVERY YEAR AT THE YARD AT THE BACK OF THE INN 
THE CATS OF MOUSEHOLE GATHER AND RAISE A GREAT HOWLING 
TO THE MEMORY OF MOWZER 
AND EVERY YEAR FOLK COME FROM ALL OVER CORNWALL 
TO SEE THE MOUSEHOLE LIT UP WITH A THOUSAND LIGHTS 
SHINING THEIR MESSAGE OF HOPE AND SAFE HAVEN 
TO ALL THOSE WHO PASS IN PERIL OF THE SEA 
BYE FOR NOW
