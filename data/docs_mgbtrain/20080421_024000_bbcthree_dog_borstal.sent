LILY IS A FIERY REDHEAD WHO DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN SHE'S A KLEPTOMANIAC 
LILY 
RALPHY'S A BABY HATER AND HIS OWNER IS SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT 
CASE OF THE DOG GOES AND THE BABY STAYS I'M AFRAID 
THE OWNERS OF THESE DOGS HAVE HAD ENOUGH 
IT'S TIME FOR EXTREME MEASURES 
THIS IS THE LAST RESORT FOR BAD DOGS 
SET UP ON A SECURE TEN ACRE COMPOUND IN A REMOTE PART OF THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
DOG BORSTAL IS RUN BY THREE OF BRITAIN'S TOUGHEST TRAINERS 
MY MISSION IS TO TEACH OWNERS TO TEACH DOGS WHO'S BOSS 
EACH TRAINER WILL TAKE ON ONE DOG AND ATTEMPT TO REFORM THEM IN JUST FOUR DAYS 
USING THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL TRAINING METHODS 
IT'S NOT THE SIZE OF THE DOG IT'S THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM 
FOR THESE DOGS THE PARTY IS WELL AND TRULY OVER 
THE FIRST INMATE TO BE SENT DOWN TO BORSTAL 
IS TWENTY MONTH OLD LILY WHO LIVES WITH HER OWNER SAM IN LUTON 
LILY MAY BE A POSH PEDIGREE SPANIEL BUT SHE BEHAVES LIKE A SCALLYWAG 
IF LILY WANTS IT LILY WILL HAVE IT 
LILY IS A THIEF SHE'S A KLEPTOMANIAC LILY 
IN THIS LIFE ONE THING COUNTS IN THE BANK LARGE AMOUNTS 
I'M AFRAID THESE DON'T GROW ON TREES 
YOU'VE GOT TO PICK A POCKET OR TWO 
LILY MAKES OUR LIFE VERY VERY DIFFICULT LILY 
YOU CAN'T TRUST HER AT ALL 
SHE'S TAKEN MY WORK SHOES TWICE EVEN THOUGH I'VE PUT THEM RIGHT HIGH ON TOP OF CUPBOARDS 
SHE WILL CLIMB UP AND SHE WILL TAKE THEM 
AND TAKING LILY FOR A WALK IN THE PARK IS NO WALK IN THE PARK 
LILY WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING 
GOD WHAT'S SHE GOT 
LILY COME ON LILY 
LILY COME HERE 
SAM'S TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET LILY UNDER CONTROL LILY 
GET CROSS WITH HER ELLIE GET OFF THE TOY 
LILY GIVE THAT TO ME 
I'VE TRIED SORT OF SNAPPING HER ON THE NOSE COME HERE BAD GIRL I TRIED MAKING MY VOICE ANGRY 
LILY GIVE THAT TO ME 
EXCLUDING HER PUTTING HER IN THE GARDEN OR IN A CRATE 
I REALLY AM AT MY WIT'S END TO KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT 
BUT LILY HAS PUSHED HER LUCK TOO FAR LILY 
NOW SHE'S BEEN SENT DOWN TO DOG BORSTAL LILY 
AT BORSTAL LILY WILL BE WITH ONE OF THE TOUGHEST DOG TRAINERS IN BRITAIN 
STRAIGHT TALKING NO FRILLS MIC MARTIN 
WITH EXPERIENCE HANDLING SOME OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST DANGEROUS DOGS AROUND 
MIC'S NOT PHASED BY ANY CANINE OFFENDER 
HELLO THERE HI 
HOW ARE YOU DOING ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT I'M SAM I'M MIC 
COME ON THEN LILY 
BEFORE THE DOGS CAN ENTER BORSTAL THEY NEED TO BE GIVEN A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH 
SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT WITH THE VET OH YEAH YEAH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL 
LILY 
OH LILY 
TURNS OUT LILY'S NOT AS GOOD WITH THE VET AS SAM THOUGHT 
I'LL NEED SOMEBODY TO HOLD HER MOUTH MUZZLE HER YEAH 
THAT JUST CLIPS BEHIND THE NECK 
IF SHE HAS AN ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING OUT IN THE STREET 
YOU'LL HAVE TO HOLD YOUR DOG SO TRY AND DO IT NOW 
COME ON GOOD GIRL SHE CAN'T HOLD IT 
YOU CAN KISS AND CUDDLE ALL YOU WANT BUT IF YOU CAN'T HOLD YOUR DOG WHAT USE ARE YOU 
HER EARS ARE A BIT MUCKY SHE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THEM 
THE VET'S NOTICED LILY'S EARS ARE IN NEED OF A CLEAN 
BUT HER UNRULY BEHAVIOUR MEANS IT HAS TO BE PUT ON HOLD 
YOU REALLY WANT TO TRY AND GET HER OVER HER FEAR OF BEING IN THIS KIND OF ENVIRONMENT 
NEXT LILY IS TAKEN OFF TO THE KENNELS 
OWNER SAM IS DISCOVERING THAT LILY'S PROBLEMS GO DEEPER THAN SHE REALISED 
IT WAS AWFUL WATCHING HER GET SO DISTRESSED HER EYES WERE GOING REALLY REALLY RED DOG IN 
THIS IS THE DOG I'D NEVER SEEN BE AGGRESSIVE LOOKING LIKE SHE'D RIP SOMEONE'S THROAT OUT 
IT WAS REALLY REALLY SCARY IN THE A TO Z. OF DOG TRAINING 
SHE'S GOT TO GO FROM A RIGHT THROUGH TO Z. AND THEN GET VOLUME TWO THREE FOUR FIVE 
LILY NOW HAS TO GET USED TO LIFE BEHIND BARS 
THE NEXT INMATE INTO DOG BORSTAL IS RALPHY 
A BOISTEROUS TWO YEAR OLD LURCHER CROSS HE WILL SOON HAVE TO COMPETE FOR HIS OWNER'S AFFECTIONS 
WE'RE SIX AND A HALF MONTHS GONE NEARLY SEVEN NOW 
RESCUE DOG RALPHY LIVES IN ALTRINCHAM WITH ABBIE AND PAUL 
HE LOVES VISITORS BUT HATES SAYING GOODBYE 
PLEASE DON'T GO BY VAN MORRISON 
WHEN PEOPLE GO TO LEAVE IT'S HELL 
JUST A NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE 
HE GETS REALLY REALLY UPSET AT THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT PEOPLE MAKE 
BASICALLY ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE AND HE RUNS TO THE FRONT DOOR AND TRIES TO BAR THE WAY 
AND THEN IF THEY GET OUT THE FRONT DOOR HE RUNS TO THE WINDOW AND HE BASICALLY GOES BERSERK 
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU DONE THAT RALPH 
IS JUST NOISY IT'S CHAOS I'M GETTING UPSET BECAUSE THE FURNITURE'S BEING TRASHED 
YOU CAN'T STOP HIM DOING WHAT HE'S DOING HE JUST DOESN'T LISTEN TO US 
HE SEES THE RED MISTS AND HE'S GONE 
IF THIS PROBLEM WASN'T BAD ENOUGH ABBIE'S SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT 
WE'RE HAVING A BABY IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS' TIME AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT RALPH 
YOU HAVE TO BE SO CAREFUL WITH DOGS AND BABIES AND I WANT TO TRY AND INTRODUCE HIM SLOWLY 
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO GET RALPHY USED TO HAVING A BABY IN THE HOUSE 
WE'LL JUST LET HIM GO SEE WHAT HE DOES 
IT'S ALL RIGHT IT'S ALL RIGHT 
IT'S ALL RIGHT THIS ISN'T REALLY GOING THAT WELL IS IT 
IT'S ALL RIGHT SHH SHH SHH SHH SHH SHH SHH SHH 
SHH SHH SHH 
IT'S ALL RIGHT 
HE WAS TRYING TO BITE THEN 
THAT WAS QUITE SCARY ACTUALLY 
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'VE LEFT IT THIS LATE TO REALISE HOW BAD IT IS 
IF WE DON'T GET IT SORTED HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO 
A CASE OF DOG GOES AND BABY STAYS I'M AFRAID 
COME ON 
THIS IS RALPHY'S LAST CHANCE 
RALPHY'S TRAINER WILL BE ROBERT ALLEYNE WHO SPECIALISES IN ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 
MEET THE BOSS RALPH THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE MISTER I'M AFRAID 
ROB KNOWS IT'S TIME TO TEACH PAUL AND ABBIE ABOUT TOUGH LOVE 
BRING HIM IN GOOD BOY GOODBYE 
OUT THE DOOR SHUT THE KENNEL DOOR WALK AWAY 
WHILE RALPHY GETS USED TO LIFE BEHIND BARS 
PAUL HEADS DOWN TO BASE CAMP TO SIZE UP HIS SLEEPING QUARTERS 
DUE TO ABBIE'S PREGNANCY ROB'S GIVEN HER PERMISSION TO SLEEP IN A LOCAL B. AND AMP B. 
YOU'RE JUST LOVING THIS AREN'T YOU 
TONIGHT OF ALL NIGHTS THIS IS A REAL BLOW 
IT'S OUR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY TODAY SO IT WILL BE A BIT STRANGE 
NOT BEING TOGETHER TONIGHT BUT I'M SURE WE'LL HANDLE IT WON'T WE I'M SURE WE'LL BE O. K. 
FOR LILY AND RALPHY IT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH WEEK 
LILY'S IN BORSTAL FOR THEFT AND VANDALISM 
SINCE ARRIVING SHE'S ALSO BEEN GUILTY OF VIOLENT CONDUCT 
BUT MIC MARTIN THINKS HE KNOWS WHO THE REAL CULPRIT IS 
THIS DOG HAS GOT ALL THE PROBLEMS AND HAS LEARNT THEM ALL FROM THE HANDLER 
RALPHY IS CHARGED WITH BEING A DANGER TO CHILDREN 
WITH OWNER ABBIE SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT 
TRAINER ROB KNOWS THE CLOCK IS TICKING 
THEY'VE GOT EIGHT WEEKS TO SORT THIS DOG OUT OR THE FUTURE'S PRETTY BLEAK I THINK 
DO THEY HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE IT THROUGH BORSTAL 
THEY'VE GOT THEIR WORK CUT OUT FOR THEM BYE BYE 
AT BORSTAL BOTH OWNERS AND DOGS ARE EXPECTED UP BRIGHT AND EARLY 
WITH THIS MORNING DEW THE INSIDE OF THE TENT'S ALL SOAKING 
THE TIMETABLE IS STRICT 
THE OWNERS MUST TAKE THE DOGS OUT FOR THEIR FIRST FRESH AIR OF THE DAY 
AND THEN THE NEXT TASK IS MUCKING OUT 
ALL THE HANDLERS MUST KEEP THEIR KENNELS SPOTLESSLY CLEAN REALLY FILTHY 
BACK AT HOME RALPHY HAD SHOWN ALARMING BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS ABBIE'S DUMMY BABY 
WHICH IS A MAJOR CAUSE FOR CONCERN JUST WEEKS BEFORE THE REAL BABY'S DUE 
WE NEED TO START TEACHING RALPHY THAT NO MEANS NO LEAVE MEANS LEAVE 
FOR ROB TO MAKE ANY HEADWAY HE NEEDS TO GO BACK TO BASICS 
AND TEACH RALPHY SOME ELEMENTARY COMMANDS 
YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR COMMAND SPECIFIC YOU WANT HIM TO LEAVE SOMETHING TELL HIM TO LEAVE 
ROB INTRODUCES THE RATTLE BOTTLE WHICH IS USED IN EXTREME CASES 
TO STOP THE DOG IN ITS TRACKS AND REINFORCE VOICE COMMANDS 
EVERY TIME HE GOES TO TAKE IT ON JUST RATTLE VERY LOUDLY AND SHARPLY AND TELL HIM TO LEAVE 
LEAVE LEAVE 
TIMING IS KEY IN ANTICIPATING RALPHY'S BAD BEHAVIOUR 
LEAVE HE LOOKED AT YOU THEN PAUL 
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER SEEN RALPH SAME RULES APPLY 
WITH PAUL NOW EQUIPPED WITH A TOOL FOR DEALING WITH RALPHY ROB DECIDES IT'S TIME TO UP THE STAKES 
IT'S ROBERTA 
IT'S MY LITTLE BABY LEAVE 
O. K. SO UM LEAVE I ONLY HAD HER THIS MORNING 
I MADE MEDICAL HISTORY RALPHY MAY BE RESTRAINED 
BUT HAS THE RATTLE BOTTLE HAD ANY EFFECT ON HIS DESIRE TO JUMP INTO THE PRAM 
LEAVE LEAVE I'M NOT TRYING TO SCAREMONGER BUT WE KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HERE YES LEAVE 
WHATEVER HE HAD TO DO IN ORDER TO GET THAT HE WOULD DO 
THIS IS YOUR BABY FOR THE WEEK PAUL 
I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT DOWN TO THE CAMP SATURATE IT WITH YOUR SCENT CARRY IT EVERYWHERE 
THE REASON IS BECAUSE I WANT THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO SMELL LIKE YOU O. K. 
AND IF HE IS HOSTILE TOWARDS THIS ONE 
THEN WE KNOW WHAT HE'LL BE LIKE WHEN THE REAL ONE COMES 
I DO THINK IT'S JUST BEGINNING TO HIT HOME JUST HOW BAD HE COULD BE 
LILY HEEL LILY'S IN BORSTAL FOR COMPULSIVE STEALING 
BUT SINCE ARRIVING SHE'S PROVED IMPOSSIBLE TO HANDLE COMING OUT 
LEFT HAND AND THEN RIGHT HAND YEAH LIKE THAT 
MIC NEEDS TO WALK OWNER SAM THROUGH THE A. B. C.'S OF DOG HANDLING 
LILY MUST WEAR A HEAD COLLAR 
TO LIMIT THE DAMAGE SHE CAN DO WITH HER TEETH 
GOOD BOY NO 
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN LOOK AT YOUR FACE 
WHAT YOU ARE GONNA DO WITH THAT YOU AIN'T GOING TO DO NOTHING WITH THAT MATE SO DON'T DO IT 
THERE ARE A MILLION PEOPLE WHO'D LOVE TO SEE YOU BITE ME IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN 
FIRST SAM MUST LEARN THE PROPER WAY TO HOLD LILY 
LILY NO 
PUT ONE ARM ROUND THE FRONT THE OTHER YOUR GOOD ARM 
THAT'S IT NICE AND TIGHT 
NO NO 
UNDERNEATH THAT'S IT GO FOR IT 
GET THEM ARMS BACK DOWN IF YOU CAN 
THAT'S GOOD THAT'S GOOD KEEP YOUR HAND THERE 
GOOD LILY WHERE'S HER HEAD GONE THAT'S IT 
FINALLY SAM STARTS TO GET SOMEWHERE WITH LILY 
GOOD BOY THAT'S IT THAT'S GOOD KEEP GOING 
YOU'RE HOLDING NICE AND HIGH YOU'RE HOLDING ALL OF THE BELLY THIS IS A GOOD LIFT 
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A GOOD LIFT 
RALPHY'S GOT HIS AFTERNOON SESSION WITH ROB 
NOW THAT BABY ROBERTA IS COVERED IN PAUL'S SCENT 
ROB'S HOPING FOR A BREAKTHROUGH IN TRAINING 
LEAVE IT IF HE JUMPS UP AND APPEARS TOO EXCITED HE HAS TO STOP 
LEAVE IT THAT'S TOO EXCITED 
LEAVE IT 
LEAVE IT 
HOWEVER IT HAS BECOME CLEAR TO ROB THAT RALPHY 
IS JUST AS OBSESSED WITH SQUEAKY TOYS AS HE SEEMS TO BE WITH BABIES LEAVE IT 
ROB FEELS THAT IF HE CAN CURE THE OBSESSION WITH TOYS 
HE'LL BEEN ABLE TO REFORM RALPHY 
LEAVE IT IT MIGHT JUST TAKE SOME TIME 
LEAVE IT LEAVE IT 
GOOD BOY LEAVE IT 
DESPITE PAUL'S BEST EFFORTS RALPHY IS STILL TEMPTED BY EVERY TOY 
OH MY GOD HOW FAR HAVE WE GOT TO GO WITH THIS DOG 
LEAVE IT LEAVE IT GOOD BOY 
LEAVE IT LEAVE IT LEAVE IT 
LEAVE IT GOOD BOY 
HE'S MAKING YOU WORK FOR YOUR MONEY HE'S MAKING ME SWEAT 
BAD DOGS LILY AND RALPHY ARE SERVING TIME AT BORSTAL 
IN JUST TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY'LL FACE A TEST 
TO PROVE THEY CAN BE RELEASED BACK INTO SOCIETY NO 
I THINK THEY'VE GOT THEIR WORK CUT OUT 
WHILE THE OTHER OWNERS BEGIN TO STIR 
SAM'S GOT AN EARLY APPOINTMENT WITH MIC AT THE KENNELS 
NOW HE'S TAUGHT HER HOW TO HOLD LILY HE WANTS TO SEE SAM GIVE HER EARDROPS 
SO HE'S SET UP C. C. T. V. TO OBSERVE HER 
GO STRAIGHT IN DO IT ON FINISHED 
BUT SAM IS STILL STRUGGLING 
LILY NO 
SOME PEOPLE THINK WE'RE MAKING A BIG THING ABOUT THE FACT SHE CAN'T HOLD HER DOG 
SHE CAN'T HOLD HER DOG FOR CHRIST'S SAKE 
THAT DOG GOES OUT TOMORROW AND GETS GLASS IN ITS PAD 
IT'S BLEEDING TO DEATH AND SHE CAN'T HOLD IT 
I DON'T THINK THE NO IS SHARP ENOUGH 
NO IT'S TOO LONG 
NO IT LASTS FOREVER 
IT'S GOT TO BE QUICK AND SHE KEEPS SAYING IT ALL THE TIME 
NO NO NO AND NOT REINFORCING IT IN ANY WAY AT ALL 
I'VE JUST GOT TO STOP HER DOING THAT 
MIC CAN'T BEAR TO WATCH A MOMENT LONGER 
SHUT UP FOR SAKE 
IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT STOP GOING OFF THERE DON'T SAY NO BECAUSE YOU'RE WASTING THE NO COMMAND 
WE'RE LOSING THE NO WHEN THE TIME COMES TO SAY NO DON'T DO THAT 
SHE THINKS THAT'S THAT STUPID WORD THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING 
MIC DECIDES IT'S TIME TO CHANGE TACK 
HE'S GOT ONE LAST ROLL OF THE DICE TO TRY TO TACKLE ALL LILY'S ISSUES IN ONE GO 
TIME FOR THE CAGE 
THIS IS USUALLY FOR THE BADDEST DOGS AT DOG BORSTAL 
IT'S REINFORCED STEEL 
ALL THE BAD BOYS GO IN HERE 
INCLUDING LILY THE TWO YEAR OLD COCKER SPANIEL 
BACK HOME LILY STOLE ANYTHING SHE COULD GET HER PAWS ON GIVE ME THAT SOCK 
WE'RE IN THE CAGE OF DEATH 
MIC'S CONFIDENT HE CAN SORT OUT LILY'S STEALING 
WITH A COMBINATION OF THE NO COMMAND 
REWARDS AND THE RATTLE BOTTLE 
LILY COME 
NO 
NO GOOD GIRL 
BEST TO GRAB HOLD OF IT YOU'VE GOT TO BE IN THERE QUICK 
NO GOOD GIRL 
NO NO NO 
NO 
GOOD GIRL WITH THE TRAINING HAVING THE DESIRED EFFECT SAM TRIES 
USING THE FOOD TREATS TO DISTRACT LILY AND SNEAK IN SOME EARDROPS 
THREE DROPS IN THAT ONE 
FINALLY A BREAKTHROUGH THREE DROPS IN THAT ONE 
FOCUS ON SOMETHING ELSE 
I'M JUST AMAZED OH LILY 
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO CRY THAT I'VE DONE THAT 
I AM GOING TO CRY I FELT LIKE CRYING WHEN YOU WEREN'T DOING IT 
I'M NOT THE SORT OF PERSON WHO CRIES THROUGH ANGER BUT WHEN SOMETHING REALLY GOOD HAPPENS 
IT WAS JUST AMAZING 
BACK HOME RALPHY HAD SHOWN WORRYING BEHAVIOUR 
TOWARDS PREGNANT ABBIE'S DUMMY BABY 
HE WAS TRYING TO BITE THEN 
MY CONCERN THAT RALPH MIGHT DELIBERATELY BITE THE CHILD BECAUSE HE HATES CHILDREN 
ISN'T THERE I DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT 
I DO WORRY THAT HE WILL BITE ONE ACCIDENTALLY 
ROB WANTS TO SEE HOW MUCH CONTROL PAUL AND ABBIE NOW HAVE OVER RALPHY 
SO HE'S GOING TO PUT THE TOYS TOGETHER WITH BABY ROBERTA 
LEAVE IT 
LEAVE IT 
HELLO THIS IS GOOD STUFF 
GOOD BOY RALPH 
BUT WITH TIME RUNNING OUT BEFORE TOMORROW'S TEST 
ROB NEEDS TO STEP THINGS UP AND SO TRIES RALPHY OFF THE LEAD 
GOOD BEHAVIOUR WILL BE REWARDED WITH FOOD TREATS 
THANK YOU AND HE CAN HAVE SOME FOOD 
WHAT HE CAN'T DO IS HARASS BABY RALPHY RALPH 
COME ON GOOD BOY 
COME ON RALPHY 
RALPHY'S MAKING PROGRESS IN LEAPS AND BOUNDS 
WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE TOO EXCITED GOOD BOY THAT'S IT 
STAY 
STAY STAY 
CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S DOING IT 
HE'S EITHER COMPLETELY SHATTERED 
OR HE'S BEING OBEDIENT AND HE'S DOING WHAT HE'S TOLD 
I DON'T THINK HE'S TIRED I THINK HE'S BEING GOOD 
LIKE STAY 
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT'S DUE 
SO HOW HAS TODAY GONE BRILLIANTLY 
WE SEE AN IMPROVEMENT EVERY SINGLE SESSION 
BUT TODAY HAS BEEN QUITE FAST PACED

HER DECISION WILL BE FINAL IN WHO GRADUATES FROM BORSTAL THIS WEEK 
FIRST TO FACE THE FINAL TEST WILL BE RALPHY 
WILL OWNERS PAUL AND ABBIE BE ABLE TO HOLD THEIR NERVE 
I'M NOT SURE HOW READY PAUL IS 
BUT HE CAN DO IT HE NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE LESS MONOTONE WE'LL SEE 
BACK AT HOME RALPHY HAD SHOWN ALARMING BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS ABBIE'S DUMMY BABY 
TODAY HE WILL BE TESTED ON HIS ABILITY TO OBEY COMMANDS 
WHATEVER THE TEMPTATION LEAVE IT 
IN ORDER TO SEE HOW MUCH CONTROL PAUL HAS OVER RALPHY 
IT'S NOT JUST HIS FAVOURITE SQUEAKY TOYS THAT MUST BE RESISTED 
BUT ALSO HIS FAVOURITE GOURMET DISHES 
YOU ARE GOING TO USE YOUR VOICE TO CONTROL HIM 
TO TELL HIM TO LEAVE IT LEAVE IT BUT YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO USE YOUR VOICE 
TO REWARD HIM AND IF NECESSARY STOP AND PRAISE HIM 
LEAVE IT LEAVE IT GOOD BOY 
BUT PAUL IS A LITTLE TOO DESPERATE TO TRY AND CONTROL RALPHY 
LEAVE IT 
LEAVE IT LEAVE IT 
LEAVE IT LEAVE IT 
LEAVE IT LEAVE IT 
I THOUGHT HE DID QUITE WELL YEAH 
I'D LIKE TO HAVE SEEN A BIT MORE PRAISE YOU WERE HEAVY ON THE CORRECTION 
I KNOW PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU GOT STRONG VOCALLY YOU GOT VERY HEAVY ON HIM 
WILL ABBIE BE ABLE TO DO ANY BETTER WITH HER VOICE COMMANDS HEEL 
HEEL PAUL LEANS MORE TOWARDS BLOODY WELL DO IT 
ABBIE IS THE OPPOSITE 
ABBIE IS GOOD BOY I WANT YOU TO DO THIS BUT I'LL TELL YOU OFF IF I HAVE TO 
WHICH IS THE BETTER WAY TO BE WITH A DOG LIKE HIM 
ABBIE TOO MUST SHOW SHE CAN CONTROL RALPHY ON THE LEAD 
GOOD BOY HEEL 
AFTER SOME BASIC HEEL WORK THE REAL CHALLENGE BEGINS

NEXT UP TO FACE THE JUDGE LILY AND SAM 
HEEL BACK HOME LILY WAS A COMPULSIVE THIEF AND VANDAL 
AND SINCE ARRIVING AT BORSTAL SHOWED SHE HAD A VIOLENT STREAK TOO 
FOR THE TEST SAM MUST STOP LILY STEALING AND CLEAN HER EARS 
BUT JUDGE ANNETTE HAS NOTICED A PROBLEM EARLY ON 
JUST STOP THERE YOU NOTICE HOW YOU'RE HOLDING THE LEAD THE CLIP 
WHEN YOU HAVE THE LEAD TIGHT IS ACTUALLY UP BY HER EYE 
OH DEAR NOW THAT'S BEEN ALL THE WAY SINCE WE CAME OUT THE KENNEL 
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS JUST MAKE SURE THERE'S A LOOP IN THE LEAD 
AND IF YOU NEED TO TIGHTEN IT USE IT AND THEN SLACKEN OFF AGAIN AFTERWARDS 
O. K. WITH THE LEAD SORTED THE TEST CAN BEGIN 
TRAINER MIC MARTIN FEELS HE'S DONE ALL HE CAN FOR SAM AND LILY 
NOW IT'S DOWN TO THEM 
FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE TEST SAM MUST PROVE THAT LILY THE THIEF HAS LEFT HER LIFE OF CRIME BEHIND HER 
LILY WAIT HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE LILY'S LAST VISIT TO THE CAGE 
SAM MUST SHOW THAT SHE CAN STOP LILY STEALING THE LOOT AND IF SHE DOES 
PICK ANYTHING UP SAM MUST GET HER TO DROP IT STRAIGHTAWAY 
LET'S SEE WHAT SHE THINKS OF A WARM SHOE 
LEAVE 
NO 
NO 
LEAVE 
ALTHOUGH SAM SEEMS TO BE IN CONTROL OF LILY ANNETTE'S NOTICED THERE'S ONE THING MISSING 
WHAT REWARD DOES SHE GET WHEN SHE LEAVES SOMETHING 
WELL SHE GETS A CUDDLE AS A REWARD SHE GETS STROKES AND PATS 
HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET RIGHT O. K. EXERCISE FINISHED 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH O. K. LILY 
NEXT SAM MUST CLEAN LILY'S EARS WITHOUT A STRUGGLE 
WILL SHE BE ABLE TO SUCCEED WITH THE ADDED PRESSURE OF TEST CONDITIONS 
I SEE YOU'RE TRYING TO BE VERY SUBTLE ABOUT IT YES NOT TOO POINTED 
YES SHE WOULDN'T HAVE LET YOU LIFT HER EAR FLAPS ON MONDAY FANTASTIC 
LET ALONE STICK THINGS INTO HER EAR 
YES SO THERE'S A LOT OF PROGRESS 
IT'S A FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT 
WITH THE TEST OVER IT'S A NERVOUS WAIT FOR THE RESULT 
I THINK LILY DID REALLY REALLY WELL I'M REALLY PLEASED 
WHEN SHE TOOK HER OWN SHOE OFF I THOUGHT IT'S GONNA SMELL OF HUMAN IT'LL BE WARM 
IT'S GOING TO BE SO INVITING BUT SHE LEFT IT SHE DIDN'T TOUCH IT SO THAT WAS REALLY GOOD 
I THOUGHT PLEASE WHAT AM I DOING TO DO IF SHE TAKES HER SHOE AND RUNS ROUND AND CHEWS IT ALL OH GOD 
RIGHT WELL I'VE BEEN THROUGH ALL MY MARKS 
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT IT WAS A CLOSE RUN THING 
YOU DID ACTUALLY PASS 
BUT YOU ALSO WENT A POINT OVER THE DISTINCTION MARK AND GOT EIGHTY ONE OUT OF ONE HUNDRED WOW 
SO YOU NOT ONLY PASSED BUT YOU PASSED WITH DISTINCTION 
THAT IS FANTASTIC AND I HAVE TO SAY YOU THOROUGHLY DESERVE IT 
HOW DID YOU GET ON 
YEAH WELL DONE REALLY GOOD 
EXCELLENT MIC SAID THAT THERE'S ONLY EVER BEEN TWO DOGS THAT HAVE GONE FOR HIM OR THE VET 
AND ONE OF THEM'S LILY 
I THOUGHT WE MUST BE AWFUL AND TO SEE HER BEHAVIOUR CHANGE 
TO THE POINT THAT SHE'S GOT A DISTINCTION IS JUST FANTASTIC I'M REALLY PLEASED 
ALL DOGS HAVE GRADUATED THEY'RE FREE TO RETURN HOME 
IN LUTON IS LILY THE DOG OR THE DIVA 
LILY HAS BEEN A HUGE AMOUNT BETTER 
SHE IS MUCH MORE RESPONSIVE TO ME 
GOOD GIRL I USE THE NO COMMAND AND SHE WILL RESPOND TO IT 
NO GOOD GIRL 
THE LACK OF STRESS AND THE FACT I CAN RELAX AND I'M NOT CONSTANTLY THINKING WHERE'S LILY 
IT'S BEEN SO MUCH BETTER 
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT REALLY GOOD 
IN ALTRINCHAM ARE RALPHY'S BABY HATING DAYS BEHIND HIM 
HE HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY HE'S BEEN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DOG 
HE'S NOT AS BOISTEROUS AND AGGRESSIVE
