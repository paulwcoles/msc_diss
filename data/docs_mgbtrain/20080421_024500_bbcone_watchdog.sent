THE PROPERTY ROGUE WHO'S BEEN IN BIG TROUBLE BEFORE 
IS HE UP TO THE SAME OLD TRICKS 
AND THE BIG NAME IN HOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN TAKE MONTHS 
TO PUT THINGS RIGHT WHEN THEY ARE ONLY AROUND THE CORNER 
THAT'S WATCHDOG TONIGHT 
HELLO GREAT TO SEE YOU 
WE'VE UNCOVERED ANOTHER BIG PROBLEM WITH A CAR 
NOT ANY OLD CAR THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR WHEELS IN BRITAIN 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FORD FOCUS 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ON THE ROAD BUT SOME CAN DEVELOP A FAULT 
THAT'S PRETTY SCARY WHEN IT HAPPENS AND IT'S EXPENSIVE TO PUT RIGHT 
DEALERS ARE CHARGING UP TO ONE HUNDRED 
THOUGH THERE'S A TEMPORARY FIX YOU CAN DO FOR A COUPLE OF QUID 
AND MORE ON THE FRIDGE THAT CAN LOSE ITS COOL AND SPOIL YOUR FOOD 
TEXT US ABOUT ANY OF OUR STORIES 
IT'LL COST YOU THE PRICE OF A STANDARD TEXT 
YOU CAN EMAIL OR CALL US 
WE READ THEM OUT LATER 
BUT FIRST A HOUSEHOLD NAME WITH A TURNOVER OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION 
THEY PUT THAT DOWN TO A HIGH QUALITY SERVICE BASED APPROACH 
WHY ARE WE SUDDENLY GETTING SO MANY COMPLAINTS 
EVERY YEAR WE SPEND MILLIONS DOING UP OUR HOMES 
QUITE A CHUNK OF THAT GOES TO ANGLIAN HOME IMPROVEMENTS 
THEY STARTED OUT IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AS ANGLIAN WINDOWS BUT THEY BRANCHED OUT 
NOW THEY DO EVERYTHING FROM GARAGE DOORS DRIVEWAYS AND CONSERVATORIES 
THE ADS SAY THEY HAVE MORE CUSTOMERS WHO RECOMMEND THEM THAN ANYONE ELSE 
ANGLIAN HOME IMPROVEMENTS MORE CUSTOMERS 
MOST RECOMMENDED 
MAYBE BUT NOT TO US 
COS WE'RE GETTING AN AWFUL LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT ANGLIAN 
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY ARE MOST PROUD OF IS THEIR REPUTATION 
A REPUTATION THAT'S BEEN FORTY YEARS IN THE MAKING 
LOSING IT MAY NOT TAKE QUITE AS LONG 
ANGLIAN'S WEBSITE IS PACKED WITH BOLD CLAIMS LIKE 
PUNCTUALITY IS IMPORTANT TO YOU AND US 
SHARON KENT HAS BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS 
TO FIX HER TENANT'S WINDOWS AT A FLAT SHE OWNS IN HASTINGS 
THE WINDOWS DIDN'T FIT PROPERLY 
THEY DIDN'T CLOSE PROPERLY 
THERE WAS A TERRIFIC DRAUGHT COMING THROUGH THE WINDOWS 
SHARON PAID THE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY SIX 
ANGLIAN WANTED IN SEPTEMBER TO HAVE THEM FIXED WITHIN A MONTH 
ONE OF THEIR TWO HUNDRED BRANCHES IS JUST ROUND THE CORNER 
AND FIXING WINDOWS IS SOMETHING THEY'VE BEEN DOING FOR FORTY YEARS 
BUT THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T FIT THE JOB IN FOR OVER SIX MONTHS 
WHEN ANGLIAN SAID IT WOULD BE SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE THEY CAME OUT 
I WAS APPALLED 
VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED AND TOTALLY DISILLUSIONED WITH THEIR SERVICE 
DESPITE CONFIRMING THE APPOINTMENT ANGLIAN DIDN'T SHOW UP 
BUT THEY SAY THEY HAVE MORE INSTALLERS THAN ANYBODY ELSE 
SO IMMEDIATELY ARRANGED A NEW DATE 
IN THREE MONTHS' TIME 
OF COURSE I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL EVEN TURN UP 
IN JULY AND IF THEY DO WE'LL HANG OUT THE FLAGS AND CELEBRATE 
THEN SOMETHING AMAZING HAPPENED ONE CALL FROM WATCHDOG 
AND SHARON'S APPOINTMENT WAS MOVED FORWARD BY THREE MONTHS 
WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS TWO INSTALLERS HAD FIXED ALL THE AFFECTED WINDOWS 
IT'S BEEN VERY HARD TO GET ANYBODY TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THIS PROBLEM 
OR TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE FOR US 
I FEEL WE'VE BEEN TREATED VERY SHODDILY BY THEM 
HARDLY A GLOWING RECOMMENDATION 
AND THERE'S PLENTY MORE 
HUNDREDS OF YOU SAY THE PROMISES MADE BY ANGLIAN 
IN THEIR CATALOGUES AND ON THEIR WEBSITE JUST DON'T RING TRUE 
THEY SAY THEIR SERVICE IS UNBEATABLE 
A CUSTOMER IN LEICESTERSHIRE DISAGREES 
ANGLIAN DAMAGED WINDOWS AND DOORS THEY INSTALLED ON A TWENTY TWO THOUSAND JOB 
AND SIX MONTHS ON HE'S STILL WAITING FOR REPLACEMENTS 
THEY SAY THEIR ROOFING SYSTEM IS UNIQUE 
ONE CLAIM THEIR CUSTOMERS AGREE WITH BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY 
WE'VE HEARD OF LEAKS IN SUTTON COLDFIELD WARWICK AND HIGH WYCOMBE 
SOMETHING ANGLIAN CLAIM TO SPECIALISE IN IS CONSERVATORIES 
IT SAYS HERE THE QUALITY OF THE BUILD IS SECOND TO NONE 
WHEN IT COMES TO INSTALLERS THEY RECKON THEY EMPLOY THE BEST 
A PROMISE THAT IN THIS CASE REALLY IS ON SHAKY FOUNDATIONS 
HILARY GOUDGE FROM THE WIRRAL PAID ANGLIAN ELEVEN THOUSAND FOR A CONSERVATORY 
THEY SAY IS SPECTACULAR AND ADDS VALUE TO YOUR HOME 
INITIALLY I WAS VERY PLEASED 
AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS I NOTICED THE FLOOR WAS BEGINNING TO SINK 
AS IT GOT WORSE I REALISED THERE WAS A PROBLEM 
ANGLIAN SENT AN ENGINEER TO INVESTIGATE HE PROMISED TO GET BACK TO HER BUT NEVER DID 
FOR THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS HILARY CHASED THE COMPANY FOR AN ANSWER 
ANGLIAN SENT A SECOND ENGINEER HILARY HASN'T HEARD BACK FROM HIM 
IT'S JUST SO UNREASONABLE THAT THEY SHOULD COME OUT AND SEE THE PROBLEM 
SAY THEY ARE GONNA DO SOMETHING AND THEN NOT 
WE ASKED AN INDEPENDENT ENGINEER TO INVESTIGATE 
HE GOT BACK TO US STRAIGHTAWAY 
DID THE BEST INSTALLERS MAKE THIS 
THERE'S AN OBVIOUS DEFECT WITH THE FOUNDATION 
THIS IS ACTUALLY ON THE MOVE 
THE FLOOR HAS ACTUALLY DROPPED IN THIS LOCATION HERE BY ABOUT TWENTY M. M. 
THE FOUNDATION IS UNACCEPTABLE WORKMANSHIP 
THE FOUNDATION IS BASIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION 
IT COULD EVEN BE DANGEROUS 
AS THE CONSERVATORY MOVES THE GLASS PANELS TWIST AND DISTORT 
IF IT IS TOUGHENED GLASS IT WILL SHATTER 
ALL OF A SUDDEN YES 
YOU COULD BE SAT HERE ONE DAY AND BANG YEAH 
THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO TAKE THE WHOLE THING DOWN AND START AGAIN 
THAT COULD COST UP TO EIGHTEEN THOUSAND WHICH HILARY WORRIES SHE'LL HAVE TO PAY 
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH ANGLIAN PROMISE A FULL TEN YEAR GUARANTEE 
THEY HAVEN'T TOLD HER EXACTLY WHAT THEY'LL DO TO PUT THINGS RIGHT 
ANGLIAN SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR POOR WORKMANSHIP 
AND COME OUT AND FIX THE CONSERVATORY AT THEIR OWN COST 
LAST SUMMER ANGLIAN CLOSED TWENTY SIX OF THEIR REGIONAL OFFICES 
ALL COMPLAINTS ARE NOW DEALT WITH BY HEAD OFFICE 
SINCE THEN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS WE'VE RECEIVED HAS INCREASED BY SIXTY PER CENT 
WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE LAST YEAR THEY WERE BOASTING 
THAT CHOOSING A REPUTABLE COMPANY IS THE BEST WAY TO AVOID ROGUE TRADERS 
BUT PEOPLE IN GLASS HOUSES REALLY SHOULDN'T THROW STONES 
ESPECIALLY WHEN SO MANY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS 
SAY THEY ARE NO BETTER OFF THAN IF THEY GAVE THEIR MONEY TO SOME ROGUE 
THEY NEED TO GET THEIR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER 
BEFORE THEY COME ROUND TO YOURS 
ANGLIAN WHOLE HEARTEDLY APOLOGISE TO ANY CUSTOMER 
THEY'VE DISAPPOINTED RECENTLY 
THEY SAY IT'S DOWN TO MOVING CUSTOMER SERVICES 
FROM TWENTY SIX CENTRES TO ONE CENTRAL ONE 
THEY MISHANDLED THAT HAMPERING THEIR ABILITY TO DELIVER STANDARDS 
THEY ARE DETERMINED TO PUT THAT RIGHT 
AND NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF CUSTOMERS ARE SO SATISFIED THAT THEY RECOMMEND THEM 
THEY HAVE NOW FIXED SHARON KENT'S WINDOWS AND THEY WILL DO THE SAME 
WITH HILARY'S CONSERVATORY UNDER THE TERMS OF HER GUARANTEE 
IF YOU HAVE AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE YOU CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICES 
NEXT SOME ANGRY RESIDENTS WHO THOUGHT THEY HAD THE RIGHT PERMITS 
TO PARK OUTSIDE THEIR OWN HOME BUT THEY STILL GOT CLAMPED 
FRESHWATER COURT IN WEST LONDON 
IT'S RUN BY A MANAGEMENT COMPANY 
IN THIS CASE HYDEHEAD LIMITED 
KNOWN FOR ITS STRICT PARKING RULES 
RESIDENTS KNOW TO DISPLAY A VALID PERMIT 
SHAN AHMED DOES BUT EARLY LAST MONTH 
HE WOKE UP TO A SIGHT HE WASN'T EXPECTING 
I SAW THEY HAVE CLAMPED MY CAR 
I SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT AWAY I SAID WHY 
HE JUST SAID BECAUSE YOUR PERMIT IS NOT VALID ANY MORE 
MARK BIRCH RENTS OUT A FLAT IN FRESHWATER COURT 
OUR TENANTS HAD WOKEN UP TO FIND BOTH THEIR CARS HAD BEEN CLAMPED 
THEY WERE DISPLAYING WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS RIGHT 
AS FAR AS HE COULD TELL HIS TENANTS 
HAD THE CORRECT PERMITS BUT IT TURNED OUT THEY DIDN'T 
HYDEHEAD LIMITED HAD ISSUED NEW ONES MAKING THE OLD PERMITS WORTHLESS 
THEY HAD BECOME INVALID OVERNIGHT WITH TO ALL INTENTS NO NOTICE 
IN FACT NOTICE HAD BEEN GIVEN BUT ONLY TWO DAYS AND BECAUSE HYDEHEAD 
HAD SENT THEM TO LANDLORDS NOT TENANTS THERE WASN'T ENOUGH TIME 
TO PICK THEM UP FROM THE POST OFFICE AND PASS THEM ONTO RESIDENTS 
BY NINE A M. ON THE DAY THE NEW PERMITS KICKED IN 
PARK DIRECT THE COMPANY EMPLOYED TO ENFORCE THE RULES 
HAD CLAMPED NINE CARS 
OVER SEVEN HUNDRED TO RELEASE THE TWO CARS AND I PAID THAT FOR THE TENANTS 
TWO OR THREE WORKING DAYS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME 
FOR ANYBODY TO TRY AND IMPLEMENT THIS 
ASSUMING YOU GOT THE LETTER 
MARK BIRCH DIDN'T RECEIVE HIS AND SHAN AHMED'S LANDLORD WAS ABROAD 
SO COULDN'T PICK THEM UP WHICH MEANT HIS CAR WAS CLAMPED AND TOWED 
WHEN I HEARD THAT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THAT MAKES ME CRAZY 
HOW CAN I PAY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO I WAS REALLY REALLY ANGRY 
IT'S NOT ILLEGAL TO CHANGE PARKING RULES AT SHORT NOTICE 
BUT THE R. A. C. THINKS WHAT HAPPENED HERE WAS UNETHICAL 
THE SCHEME IS ABOUT PROTECTING THE RIGHT OF RESIDENTS TO PARK 
NOT CATCHING THEM OUT WITH NEW PERMITS 
AND CLAMPING ANYONE WITH AN OLD PERMIT 
REALLY TWO DAYS' NOTICE IS NOT FAIR PLAY 
IT'S NOT GIVING THE RESIDENTS A CHANCE TO PARK CORRECTLY 
I COULD HAVE LOST MY JOB BECAUSE I'M A TAXI DRIVER 
HE SHOULD GIVE US AT LEAST A WEEK'S NOTICE NOT ONLY TWO DAYS 
WELL HYDEHEAD LIMITED SAY THEY ISSUED NEW PERMITS 
AFTER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NON RESIDENTS PARKING ON THE ESTATE 
THEY DON'T AGREE EITHER OF THOSE CASES HAVE GROUNDS FOR COMPLAINT 
AND INSIST WARNING NOTICES WERE DISPLAYED IN EVERY ENTRANCE HALL 
THOUGH NO ONE THAT WE'VE SPOKEN TO SAW ANY OF THEM 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTERS AND E. MAILS 
YOU WERE LEFT HOT AND BOTHERED BY SOMETHING MEANT TO DO THE OPPOSITE 
THE SAMSUNG R. S. TWENTY ONE FRIDGE THAT'S NO COOLER THAN THE BOOT OF YOUR CAR 
AFTER OUR REPORT SAMSUNG SAID THEY'D BE EXTENDING 
ALL R. S. TWENTY ONE CUSTOMER WARRANTIES IN RESPECT OF THIS FAULT 
SO IF IT HAPPENS WITHIN FIVE YEARS THEY WILL FIX IT FOR FREE 
BUT WE'VE HAD STACKS MORE E. MAILS AND A FEW OF YOU 
FELT RETAILERS SHOULDN'T GET OUT OF THIS SCOT FREE AFTER ALL 
THEY HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THINGS GO WRONG AND SOME RECKON 
THE SAME FAULT OCCURS WITH ANOTHER SAMSUNG FRIDGE THE R. S. TWENTY 
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY THE SAME DESIGN WITH SOME OF THE COOLER FEATURES 
TREVOR GREEN SPEAKS FOR MANY WHEN HE ASKS 
WILL THIS FRIDGE BE COVERED BY THE SAME EXTENDED WARRANTY 
SAMSUNG SAY THE FRIDGES HAVE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT COOLING MECHANISM 
SO R. S. TWENTY ISSUES ARE UNRELATED TO THE FAULT WE SHOWED LAST WEEK 
BUT IF YOU HAVE GOT A PROBLEM CALL THEM FREE ON 
THEY SAY THEY'LL IDENTIFY THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO DEAL WITH IT 
LET US KNOW HOW YOU GET ON 
WITH HOUSES BECOMING HARDER TO SELL 
PAUL HEINEY INVESTIGATES A MAN WHO COULD TURN THAT TO HIS ADVANTAGE 
NOW MAY NOT BE THE EASIEST TIME TO SELL YOUR HOME 
SO WHEN THERE'S A BUYER IT SHOULD BE THE END OF YOUR PROPERTY WOES 
BUT IT COULD JUST BE THE BEGINNING 
ESPECIALLY IF THE MAN MAKING THE PROMISES IS ONE KEITH FRYER 
HE'S A RATHER INTERESTING CHARACTER WITH AN INTRIGUING CRIMINAL CAREER 
IF YOU'RE THINKING OF DOING BUSINESS WITH HIM 
WHAT IS ABOUT TO APPEAR ON SCREEN YOU MIGHT FIND DISTURBING 
IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES 
KEITH FRYER RAN DODGY MONEY LENDING COMPANIES WHICH BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
CAUGHT ESTHER RANTZEN'S EYE AND EARNED HIM HIS FIRST T. V. APPEARANCE 
THEY LENT SOMEONE WHO COULDN'T READ FOUR HUNDRED AT AN INTEREST RATE OF THREE HUNDRED NINETEEN PER CENT 
WE WANTED TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT TRAPPING A FAMILY ALREADY IN DEBT 
SORRY GET OUT OF HERE 
HOW DARE YOU FRYER DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY FOR HIMSELF 
SOON AFTERWARDS HE HEADED WEST TO AMERICA THE LAND OF THE FREE 
ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T STAY THAT WAY 
HE WAS JAILED FOR A FORTY MILLION DOLLAR MONEY LAUNDERING SCAM 
AND LANDED HIMSELF FOUR YEARS BEHIND BARS 
THAT DIDN'T STOP FRYER 
HE CAME HOME AND SET UP MORE COMPANIES THIS TIME IN PROPERTY 
UNITY INVESTMENTS BASED IN MANCHESTER 
EARNED HIM HIS SECOND T. V. APPEARANCE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
THAT COMPANY TARGETED HOUSE SELLERS 
FRYER TOLD THEM HE HAD A BUYER FOR THEIR HOMES READY TO EXCHANGE FAST 
IN RETURN ALL HE WANTED WAS A PROCESSING FEE OF THREE HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
BUT NO BUYER EVER MATERIALISED AND THEY LOST ALL THEIR MONEY 
TO UNITY INVESTMENTS FOR GOD'S SAKE STOP THIS 
IT'S SO UNFAIR 
ONCE AGAIN HE DIDN'T WANT TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF 
MR. FRYER SIR MR. FRYER 
AFTER THAT WE THOUGHT KEITH FRYER MIGHT RETIRE TO HIS HOME 
HERE ON THIS RATHER NICE GATED DEVELOPMENT 
BUT IN FACT HE WAS STILL VERY MUCH IN BUSINESS 
THIS TIME USING THE NAME CAPITAL FUNDING STILL BASED IN MANCHESTER 
AGAIN HE WAS STILL PROMISING HE HAD BUYERS AND TAKING FEES 
BUT THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING TOOK HIM TO COURT AFTER FINDING 
NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF THE SALES HE PROMISED EVER HAPPENED 
IN MAY TWO THOUSAND SIX HE UNDERTOOK HE WOULD NEVER MISLEAD HOUSE SELLERS AGAIN 
IF HE BREAKS THAT HE RISKS PRISON 
BUT JUST WEEKS AFTER MAKING THOSE PROMISES 
KEITH FRYER PUT AN OFFER ON SANDRA COLIN'S MOTHER'S HOUSE 
HE OFFERED FIVE THOUSAND LESS THAN SHE WANTED 
AND HE SAID HE HAD A BUYER READY TO GO 
THE FAMILY PAID THE USUAL THREE HUNDRED NINETY TWO PROCESSING FEE 
WHICH THEY WERE TOLD THEY'D GET BACK ON COMPLETION 
BUT GUESS WHAT THAT NEVER HAPPENED 
MY MOTHER WERE PANICKING WE WANTED A COMPLETION DATE 
WE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THE BUYERS WERE AND WE NEVER GOT ANSWERS 
KEITH FRYER TOLD THEM NOT TO WORRY HE CLAIMED THE BUYER WAS ON HOLIDAY 
FOR A MAN WHO ALREADY HAD A BUYER HE WAS ACTING VERY STRANGELY 
HE ASKED THE FAMILY'S ESTATE AGENT TO HELP HIM FIND ONE 
THIS FELLOW WAS CAUSING US SO MUCH DISTRESS 
WE DIDN'T EXPECT MY MUM TO LIVE THROUGH IT TO SEE ANY MONEY 
SHE GOT SO DOWN SO DEPRESSED 
WE JUST COULDN'T WAIT NO LONGER SO WE HAD TO PULL OUT 
COMPLAINTS ABOUT FRYER ARE SO FAMILIAR 
TO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ESTATE AGENTS 
THAT LAST YEAR THEY SENT A LETTER ABOUT HIM TO ALL THEIR MEMBERS 
HE'S BEEN AROUND FOR FOUR YEARS NOW 
AND WE KNOW THE WAY THAT HE OPERATED HIS COMPANIES IN THE FIRST PLACE 
SO WE SENT A WARNING OUT TO ALL OF OUR MEMBERS SAYING 
JUST BE AWARE THAT MR. FRYER IS OPERATING AGAIN 
UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL ESTATE AGENTS ARE MEMBERS OF THAT ASSOCIATION 
SO THEY DIDN'T GET THE WARNING 
LIKE THE ONE THE GARVIN FAMILY USED TO SELL THEIR DAD'S HOUSE 
WHEN HE WENT INTO CARE 
IT HAD BEEN A COUPLE OF MONTHS 
AND WE GOT AN OFFER FROM CAPITAL FUNDING IN NOVEMBER 
WHICH WAS FIVE THOUSAND LESS THAN WHAT WE WERE ASKING FOR 
DESPERATE FOR A SALE TO PAY THE CARE HOME FEES THEY ACCEPTED 
CAPITAL FUNDING SAID THEY HAD A BUYER LINED UP 
AND TRUE TO FORM ASKED FOR THE FEE OF THREE HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY ODD THAT WE WERE PAYING THEM 
BUT I WAS ADVISED THAT WITHIN EIGHT WEEKS' TIME 
THE HOUSE WOULD BE SOLD AND OUR WORRIES WOULD BE GONE AWAY REALLY 
BUT WHEN ANDREW'S SOLICITOR SAW THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT 
HE ADVISED HIM TO PULL OUT IMMEDIATELY 
EVEN IF THERE WAS A BUYER FRYER'S CONTRACT MEANT THAT ANDREW'S FATHER 
WOULD HAVE TO PAY THEIR LEGAL AND ESTATE AGENCY FEES TOO 
NO WONDER AN EXPERT WE SHOWED THE CONTRACT TO SAID IT WAS CONFUSING 
UNETHICAL AND COULD EVEN BREAK THE PROMISES FRYER MADE IN COURT 
CAPITAL FUNDING GAVE UNDERTAKINGS TO THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING 
THE CONTRACT WHICH HAD BEEN SHOWN TO ME IS VERY ONE SIDED 
AND CONVEYS REALLY NO RIGHTS ON THE SELLER 
SO IN MY OPINION IT APPEARS THAT THIS UNDERTAKING HAS BEEN BROKEN 
ONE OF THE KEY PROMISES FRYER MADE 
WAS THAT HE WOULDN'T CLAIM TO HAVE BUYERS WHEN HE DIDN'T 
WE'VE TOLD THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING IT SEEMS 
IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN AND THEY ARE VERY KEEN TO EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE 
FRYER LIKES TO FILL CONTRACTS WITH WORDS CUSTOMERS CANNOT UNDERSTAND 
SO HOW ABOUT SOME PLAIN WORDS TO DESCRIBE HIM 
LIKE SHAMELESS OR ROGUE 
A SUB PRIME KIND OF OPERATOR IF EVER THERE WAS ONE 
WELL KEITH FRYER VEHEMENTLY DENIES OUR ALLEGATIONS 
HE SAYS SINCE HE AGREED THOSE UNDERTAKINGS IN COURT HE'S CHANGED 
HIS CONTRACTS WHICH NOW MAKE CLEAR THERE IS NO DEFINITE BUYER 
SO WHY WOULD ANYONE ENTER INTO A CONTRACT THAT PROMISES NOTHING 
PEOPLE WE SPOKE TO ARE ADAMANT THEY WERE ASSURED 
A BUYER WAS ALREADY IN PLACE 
WELL KEITH FRYER SAYS HE HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR HOW ESTATE AGENTS OR SELLERS INTERPRET HIS OFFERS 
IF ANYONE CAN PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT A SALE DIDN'T HAPPEN 
AFTER HE SAID THERE WAS A BUYER HE SAYS HE'LL REFUND THEIR FEE 
AND OF COURSE IF ANYONE DOES HAVE THAT EVIDENCE 
WE AND THE AUTHORITIES WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT TOO 
CAPITAL FUNDING AND UNITY INVESTMENTS HAVE 
NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY COMPANIES WITH SIMILAR NAMES 
WHEN WE IDENTIFY A PROBLEM WITH A CAR MANUFACTURERS REACT VERY DIFFERENTLY 
WE HAVE SEEN VAUXHALL SWIFTLY ANNOUNCE MAJOR RECALLS 
WHILE RENAULT STILL BLAMES CUSTOMERS WHENEVER A CLIO BONNET FLIES OPEN 
NEW CASES OF THAT ARE STILL COMING IN 
SO HOW WILL FORD PERHAPS THE BEST KNOWN NAME IN THE BUSINESS 
RESPOND TO THE NEWS THAT WE HAVE FOUND A SERIOUS FAULT 
WITH THE MOST POPULAR CARS ON THE ROAD 
IT'S THE CAR THAT CHANGED THE WAY WE DRIVE THE FORD FOCUS 
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS IT'S BEEN BRITAIN'S BEST SELLING CAR 
THEY PROMISED IT WAS DESIGNED FOR LIVING AND ENGINEERED TO LAST 
BUT SOME WEREN'T ENGINEERED TO LAST QUITE AS LONG AS THEY SHOULD 
THERE'S A VITAL PART THAT AFTER A FEW YEARS COULD STOP WORKING 
AND IF IT DOES YOU COULD BE BREAKING THE LAW 
I THINK YOU DO NOT REALISE HOW MUCH YOU RELY ON YOUR SPEEDOMETER 
IT BASICALLY FROZE ON THE MOTORWAY 
AND THAT WAS I WAS REALLY SCARED 
IT WAS QUITE SCARY GOING PAST SPEED CAMERAS 
NOT KNOWING HOW FAST I WAS GOING 
DOZENS OF YOU HAVE TOLD US THE SAME THING 
ALL THE DIALS ON THE DASHBOARD HAVE SUDDENLY STARTED TO FAIL 
IT HAPPENED TO DAVID BELL IN NOVEMBER 
IT WAS VERY DISCONCERTING I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SPEED I WAS DOING 
I HAD NO IDEA REALLY HOW MUCH PETROL I HAD IN THE VEHICLE 
THE PROBLEM WAS INTERMITTENT 
SOME DAYS IT WORKED SOME DAYS NOT WHICH WAS A PROBLEM 
WHEN HE FIRST TOOK HIS CAR TO A GARAGE 
THEY COULDN'T TELL WHAT WAS WRONG 
IN THE END I WAITED A FEW WEEKS UNTIL IT FAILED COMPLETELY 
DRIVING WITHOUT A WORKING SPEEDOMETER IS AGAINST THE LAW 
UNLESS YOU'RE MAKING YOUR WAY HOME OR TO A GARAGE 
YOU COULD BE FINED A HEFTY ONE THOUSAND 
THIS IS WHAT IS GOING WRONG THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER 
WHEN IT FAILS YOU JUST CAN'T TELL WHAT YOUR CAR IS DOING 
AND IF THAT DOES NOT SCARE YOU 
THE PRICE YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY TO GET IT FIXED JUST MIGHT 
FORD DEALERS SAY THE WHOLE CLUSTER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED 
AT A COST OF BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY AND FIVE HUNDRED 
SMITA PATEL WAS APPALLED WHEN THEY SAID THAT TO HER 
I FEEL REALLY ANGRY 
BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH IT WILL COST TO GET MY INSTRUMENT CLUSTER FIXED 
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY 
AND FOR THAT TO STOP WORKING MY CAR IS NOT THAT OLD 
I DON'T EXPECT SOMETHING MAJOR LIKE THAT TO GO WRONG 
WE ASKED EXPERT MARK BROWN TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM 
HE QUICKLY TRACED IT TO THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER'S CIRCUIT BOARD 
IT CAN CORRODE OVER TIME AND THAT IS WHY IT STOPS WORKING 
THESE CIRCUIT BOARDS ARE FAILING THEY SHOULD LAST THE LIFE OF THE CAR 
IT HAS TO BE A DESIGN FAULT OF THE BOARD OR WHERE IT'S FITTED 
NEW MODELS HAVE A MODIFIED CIRCUIT BOARD THAT STOPS THIS HAPPENING 
OUR RESEARCH SUGGESTS IT ONLY AFFECTS TWO THOUSAND THREE MARK ONE FOCUSES 
BUT THEN THAT IS NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM 
IF IT IS A DESIGN FAULT FORD CLAIMS TO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT 
THEY'VE WRITTEN TO CUSTOMERS SAYING THERE ARE NO KNOWN CONCERNS 
THOUGH SOME OF THEIR OWN DEALERS DON'T SAY THE SAME THING 
WE VISITED THREE DEALERSHIPS 
AND TOLD THEM THE DIALS ON OUR CAR HAD STOPPED WORKING 
TWO OF THEM KNEW WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
AND IT'S A FAULT SOME CUSTOMERS REMEMBER FOR A DIFFERENT REASON 
THE HUNDREDS IT COSTS TO PUT RIGHT 
MARK BROWN THINKS THE PRICE FORD DEALERS ARE CHARGING IS EXCESSIVE 
FORD WILL ONLY SELL THE WHOLE CLUSTER ASSEMBLY IN EXCESS OF THREE HUNDRED 
THE PART THAT'S FAILING IS THE MUCH CHEAPER CIRCUIT BOARD 
WHICH SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ABOUT SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED 
AND THERE COULD BE AN EVEN CHEAPER WAY OF FIXING IT 
WITHOUT EVEN GOING TO A GARAGE WITH THIS 
W. D. FORTY OR A SIMILAR CONTACT SPRAY 
WHEN MATT SKINNER'S CLUSTER STOPPED WORKING 
HE READ ON THE INTERNET THAT THIS COULD HELP 
THE FIX RECOMMENDED THAT YOU TAKE OUT THE INSTRUMENT PANEL 
AND REMOVE THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD FROM BEHIND THE DASHBOARD 
SPRAY IT WITH A CONTACT CLEANER LET IT DRY 
AND STICK IT BACK IN AND GIVE IT A GO 
MY DASHBOARD MIRACULOUSLY CAME TO LIFE 
I DIDN'T HAVE TO SPEND ANY MONEY I ALREADY HAD THE CONTACT SPRAY 
SO I FIXED IT FOR FREE ESSENTIALLY 
FOUR MONTHS ON AND MATT'S CAR IS WORKING FINE 
BUT HIS CHEAP AND CHEERFUL REMEDY MAY NOT LAST FOR EVER 
WHAT ABOUT OUR QUICK FIX SOLUTION 
WELL I KNOW THAT IT FIXES THE PROBLEM TEMPORARILY 
BUT THIS SPRAY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH STAYING POWER FOR A PERMANENT FIX 
THE FORD FOCUS ISN'T THE FIRST CAR TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM 
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WE HIGHLIGHTED ANOTHER SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH THE AUDI T. T. 
AUDI REPLACED MANY OF THE FAULTY PARTS FOR FREE 
MARK BROWN THINKS THAT FORD SHOULD DO THE SAME 
WHY SHOULD FORD FIX THESE CARS THEY'RE OUT OF WARRANTY 
WELL FIRSTLY THE COMPONENT FAILING IS SOLID STATE 
IT SHOULD LAST THE LIFE OF THE CAR 
AND SECONDLY IT'S LIKELY THAT FORD KNEW ABOUT THIS 
AND SO I THINK THEY'VE GOT A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO EITHER FIX THEM 
OR AT LEAST BRING THE COST OF THE REPAIR DOWN 
PERHAPS BRITAIN'S BIGGEST CAR COMPANY 
SHOULD READ ITS OWN MISSION STATEMENT 
WHICH SAYS ABOVE ALL THEY DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS 
SO WHY ARE THEY MAKING THOSE SAME CUSTOMERS PAY HUNDREDS OF POUNDS 
TO FIX SOMETHING THAT ISN'T THEIR FAULT 
IT'S FORD'S 
WELL FORD SAY THAT THEY'RE GRATEFUL TO US 
FOR BRINGING THIS TO THEIR ATTENTION 
THEY'D HEARD FROM ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DRIVERS 
BUT THE INFORMATION DIDN'T SUGGEST THE ISSUE COULD BE MORE WIDESPREAD 
THEY DON'T THINK IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE 
BUT AGREE IT IS UNSETTLING AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED URGENTLY 
THEY SAY THE NEW INFORMATION WE PROVIDED 
WILL HELP THEM SO THEY CAN WORK OUT A PERMANENT REPAIR 
THEY'LL BE ANNOUNCING A PLAN FOR THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
THEY SAY IT IS ONLY MARK ONE FOCUSES FROM FOUR YEARS AGO 
OR EARLIER THAT CAN BE AFFECTED 
WELL WITH US IS TIM FROM THE INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED MOTORISTS HI 
YET AGAIN WATCHDOG BRINGS TO THE ATTENTION OF A BIG CAR COMPANY 
A FAULT IN ONE OF ITS CARS 
IT IS EXTRAORDINARY ISN'T IT 
I'M REALLY SURPRISED THAT FORD CLAIMED THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS 
I'VE BEEN GETTING LETTERS FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
YOU'VE HAD LOTS OF PEOPLE CONTACTING YOU ABOUT IT 
NONE OF THEM WENT TO FORD IN THE FIRST INSTANCE 
IT'S A VERY BIG COMPANY AND THEY DON'T EVEN PARDON THE PUN 
FOCUS ON IT 
THEY NEED BETTER COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS BETWEEN THE DEALERS 
THEY CALL THEM ISOLATED INCIDENTS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY ISOLATED INCIDENTS 
IF THEY'RE NOT FINDING OUT ABOUT IT I CAN FIND OUT ABOUT IT 
PUT SOMEBODY ON THE CASE 
AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SQUIRT IT WITH W. D. FORTY TO FIX IT 
BUT EVEN THAT TYPE OF CURE 
IF ONLY THEY MADE THAT AVAILABLE TO THE OWNERS OF THEIR CARS 
I KNOW THEY'RE OUT OF WARRANTY 
BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF ADVICE THAT PEOPLE WANT 
AND YOU SELL YOUR CAR AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MILES IT'S DONE 
THE PERSON YOU'RE BUYING IT MIGHT THINK YOU'VE BEEN CLOCKING IT 
IF YOU GET THAT UNIT REPLACED YOU NEED AN ENTRY 
ON THE LOG BOOK SAYING ADD TWENTY SIX THOUSAND MILES TO THE MILEAGE 
PEOPLE ARE PUT OFF AND THEY CAN BE VERY HARD TO SELL 
AND YOU COULD GET NICKED AS WELL YOU COULD GET NICKED FOR SPEEDING 
YOU CAN FINISH YOUR JOURNEY AND DRIVE TO THE GARAGE 
IT'S INTERMITTENT AND IF THE DEALER CLAIMS NO KNOWLEDGE WHAT THEN 
IF YOUR FOCUS DEVELOPS THIS FAULT THEN WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU 
WE'VE ALSO PUT A DOWNLOADABLE LETTER TO SEND TO FORD ON OUR WEBSITE 
THAT IS ALSO WHERE YOU SEND US YOUR OTHER STORIES TO INVESTIGATE AS WELL 
OR YOU CAN CALL ON 
OR WRITE TO US AND IT COULD BE YOUR STORY ON THE SHOW NEXT WEEK 
THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR E. MAILS AND TEXTS 
MOST OF THEM ARE REGARDING ANGLIAN WINDOWS AND BAD TIMEKEEPING
