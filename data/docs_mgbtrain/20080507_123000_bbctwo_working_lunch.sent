GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO 
WEDNESDAY'S WORKING LUNCH I'M NIK 
WOOD OIL PRICES HAVE HIT ANOTHER 
RECORD HIGH ONE WORKING LUNCH 
VIEWER HAS SEEN HER HEATING BILL 
TRIP UNTIL THE LAST FEW YEARS IT 
SHOWS NO SIGN OF GOING DOWN THERE 
IS A WARNING THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE 
HAVE TRAINED TO PRODUCE HOME 
INFORMATION PACKS WRONG FOOTED BY 
THE F. T. S. E. WHY THE F. T. S. E. COULD 
MISLEAD INVEST TORS ONE FAT LADY 
FOR RANK AS IT REVEALS RE KNEW 
FIGURES ARE THE GOOD TIMES OVER 
FOR THE NO FRILLS AIRLINES COULD 
HIGH OIL PRICES AND AN ECONOMIC 
SLOWDOWN MEAN HARD TIMES AHEAD FOR 
EASYJET WITH MASSAGE AND HERBAL 
REMEDIES I WILL MET THE WOMAN WHO 
SET UP A BUSINESS USING ANCIENT 
TREATMENTS TO TREAT HORSES THE 
PRICE OF CRUDE OIL COULD SORE TO 
TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER BARREL WITHIN SIX MONTHS 
ACCORDING TO GOLDMAN SACKS THIS 
TIME LAST YEAR BRENT CRUDE WAS 
BELOW SEVENTY DOLLARS A BARREL ON TUESDAY IT 
HIT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A BARREL IT HAS COME OFF 
A LITTLE ON THAT TODAY AND WE ARE 
NOW DOWN TO AROUND ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN DOLLARS 
THIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE 
LAST MONTH W. THE DIP AND A RECENT 
RALLY THESE RISING PRICES ARE MOST 
NOTICEABLE WHEN YOU FILL UP YOUR 
CAR WITH PETROL THE PAIN IS 
INCREASED FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HEAT 
THEIR HOMES AND HOT WATER USING OIL 
THIS IS THE TANK IN QUESTION 
FEATURED BY US A LITTLE WHILE AGO 
WHEN OIL HAD ALREADY DOUBLED NOW 
IT HAS TRIPLEED 
YES AND THAT WAS 
VERY SCARY 
THE TANK IS OWNED BY 
ELIZABETH FROM LINCOLNSHIRE WHO 
OPTED FOR AN OIL SYSTEM BECAUSE 
LIKE MORE THAN ONE MILLION HOMES IN 
THE U. K. HERS IS NOT ON MAINS GAS 
AND NOW SHE IS SUFFERING SHE SPOKE 
TO ME THIS TIME OVER THE PHONE 
BASICALLY WE ARE TRYING NOT TO USE 
IT AT ALL APART FROM FIFTEEN MINUTES A 
DAY JUST TO HEAT OUR HOT WATER WE 
ARE DOWN TO ABOUT THE LAST SIX 
INCHS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK WE 
ARE JUST NOT GOING TO PUT ANY MORE 
OIL IN IT UNTIL EITHER PRICES COME 
DOWN OR UNTIL WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY 
GOT TO PUT SOME IN 
BACK THE TWO THOUSAND TWO 
ELIZABETH PAID 
JUST OVER SIXTEEN P. A 
LITRE TO FILL HER TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LITRE TANK 
SO JUST OVER FOUR HUNDRED THAT WOULD LAST 
HER LESS THAN A YEAR TODAY'S QUOTE 
IS FIFTY FIVE P. PER LITRE OR ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO TO FILL 
UP THE TANK 
I F. WE DIDN'T HAVE SOME SAVINGS TO 
FALL BACK ON WE WOULD BE FINDING 
IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND 
BASICALLY I'M SHOPPING AT THE 
CHEAPER SUPERMARKETS SAVING MONEY 
ON FOOD MY HUSBAND IS GROWING 
LOADS OF VEG IN THE GARDEN WE ARE 
JUST CUTTING BACK ON EVERYTHING WE 
CAN SO WE KNOW WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY 
THIS WINTER TO BUY OUR FUEL HERE HERE IS ANOTHER TANK WHICH STARED ON THE 
B. B. C. RECENTLY THIS ONE IN SOMERSET 
OWNED BY ANOTHER VIEWER RESIDENTS 
OF THE VILLAGE CLUBBED TOGETHER 
TO 
BUY OIL MORE CHEAPLY THAT CAN SAVE 
A PENCE PER LITRE IF THE PRICE 
TRIPLES THERE IS NO DEFENCE 
INTERESTING THINGS THESE BUYING 
GROUPS THEY CAN SAVE MONEY JUST 
HOW BENEFICIAL ARE THEY 
WELL WE 
HAVE HEARD ABOUT A NUMBER OF THEM 
SOME FROM VIEWERS THERE IS YOB CO 
IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE THERE IS ONE 
CALLED WELLLY BOOT IN CORNWALL AND 
THERE IS BOILER USE WE FEATURED A 
LITTLE WHILE AGO THERE IS THE 
CARHAMPTON GROUP WHO GET TOGETHER 
AND BUY IT IS A GOOD IDEA 
SOMETIMES THEY CAN GET TEN TO TWENTY PER CENT OFF 
THE PRICE IF THEY ARE CHARGED 
SOMETHING OUT OF LINE GENERALLY 
SPEAKING IT IS A FEW PENCE ON A 
LITRE THEY WOULD SAVE THAT IS 
SOMETHING THE POINT IS THE OIL 
TANKER COMES AND FILES UP 
EVERYONE'S TANK AT THE SAME TIME 
IT IS EFFICIENT FOR EVERYONE 
CONCERNED SO THERE IS SOMETHING TO 
BE GAINED PARTICULARLY IN THESE 
TIMES BUT IT WON'T GET RID OF THE 
FACT THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A HUGE 
INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF OIL THAT THAT IS MY NEXT QUESTION ELIZABETH 
WATCHING WITH AN OIL TANK AND EVEN 
L. P. G. ARE ALL SAYING HOW HIGH CAN IT 
GO 
L. P. G. IS PARTICULARLY BAD AT THE GO MOMENT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN RECENT 
DAYS IS ONE OF THE STOCK BROCKING 
GROUPS HAVE COME UP WITH A FORECAST 
THAT OIL COULD GO UP TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A 
BARREL THAT IS FRIGHTENING FOR 
PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON IT ESPECIALLY 
CONSIDERING IT WAS NOT THAT LONG 
AGO IT WAS ONLY TWENTY DOLLARS A BARREL YOU 
CAN SEE THE SCALE OF THE INCREASE 
THERE THERE ARE OTHER COMMENTATORS 
WHO SAY THERE IS SO MUCH SUPPLY OUT 
THERE THAT WE COULD END UP WITH A 
FALL IN THE PRICE OF OIL L. WENT TO 
ONE OIL ANALYST WHO TENDS TO GO TO 
THE OPEC MEETINGS AROUND THE WORLD 
AND HAS A REAL INSIGHT INTO THE 
SITUATION HE FEELS THE MARKET IS 
NOT WORKING VERY WELL AT THE MOM 
IT IS JOHN HALL THIS IS WHAT HE 
THINKS ABOUT THE PROSPECT FOR THE 
OIL PRICE 
I WOULD SAY TODAY THAT 
THE PRICE OF OIL IS INFLATED BY 
SPECULATER ACTIVITY IT IS PROBABLY 
THIRTY PER CENT UP ON WHERE IT SHOULD BE IF 
YOU TAKE FUNDAMENTALS INTO ACCOUNT 
THAT IS WHERE THE MARKET IS TODAY 
HEDGE STPUNDS ARE THERE N. THERE NOW 
AS FUNDS ARE IN THERE NOW IT IS 
PUSHING INFLATION UP L. THINK ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
IS HIGH BUT THE WAY THE MARKET IS 
MOVING PEOPLE LOOKING FOR THE 
FATHER FACTOR WHICH IS OUT THERE 
THEY ARE LOOKING TO SEE THAT PRICE 
RISE FURTHERMENT EVEN THOUGH THERE 
COULD BE SOME CORRECTION LATER IN 
THE YEAR ONE CANNOT COUNT ON IT 
IS IT BETTER TO WAIT UNTIL THE 
AUTUMN OR BUY NOW 
THIS IS THE 
DILEMMA THAT PEOPLE LIKE ELIZABETH 
ARE FACING THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO 
NOT VERY LONG AGO OIL WAS CHEAPER 
THAN GAS TO HEAT THE HOME NOW IT 
HAS CHANGED AROUND THE QUESTION IS 
SHOULD SHE FILL UP NOW OR WAIT FOR 
THAT CEX IN THE AUTUMN IF IT COMES 
ALONG THIS IS JOHN'S OPINION ON 
THAT QUESTION 
IF YOU LOOK AT 
HEATING OIL A YEAR AGO YOU WOULD 
GET IT FOR FORTY P. NOW YOU PAY NEARER 
SIXTY P. ALTHOUGH THERE SHOULD BE A 
LEVEL OF CORRECTION IT COULD HAPPEN 
LATER THIS YEAR FOR MY MONEY I 
WOULD BUY TODAY L. WOULD BUY TWO 
THIRDS OR THREE QUARTERS OVER THE 
OIL NOW THEN I WOULD KNOW WHERE I 
WAS RATHER THAN HOPING FOR A 
DECREASE AND GETTING A WHACKING 
GREAT INCREASE THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
A TWO HUNDRED A YEAR THAT IT GIVES OUT FOR 
PENSIONERS ON FUEL IT WILL HAVE TO 
LOOK NOW NOT WAIT IT WILL HAVE TO 
LOOK NOW AT INCREASING THAT TO AT 
LEAST THREE HUNDRED IF NOT FOUR HUNDRED FOR THIS 
FORTHCOMING WINTER 
WE HAD A 
PROMISE THAT THAT WINTER FUEL 
PAYMENT WOULD GO UP BY FIFTY JOHN IS 
LOOKING FOR MORE THAN THAT IT IS 
IRONIC THEY ARE LOOKING TO THE 
WINTER FUEL PAYMENT AS A WAY TO 
COMPENSATE PEOPLE FOR THE LOSS OF 
THE TEN P. TAX BAND A LOT WILL DEPEND 
ON IT 
AS AN OIL USER MYSELF I 
HOPE MY NEIGHBOURS ARE WATCHING WE 
WILL CONSIDER ONE OF THOSE GROUPS 
NOW THE REST OF THE BUSINESS NEWS 
TWO MILLION WORKERS IN THE U. K. ARE 
TRAPPED IN LOW PAID INSECURE JOBS 
SUFFERING MISTREATMENT FROM BOSSES 
THIS WARNING COMES FROM THE TUC 
AFTER IT SURVEYED EIGHT THOUSAND WORKER 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IT FOUND 
WIDE SPREAD EVIDENCE THAT LOWS ON 
PAY CONDITIONS AND BENEFITS ARE 
BEING FLOUTED THE DEBT MANAGEMENT 
INDUSTRY IS STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP 
WITH DEMAND FROM PEOPLE IN TROUBLE 
WITH THEIR BORROWING ONE FIRM SAID 
IT EXPECTS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
TAKING OUT ITS DEBT MANAGEMENT 
PLANS TO DOUBLE THIS YEAR TO OVER 
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT TDX GROUP WARNS THE 
INDUSTRY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DEAL 
WITH THE SURGE BECAUSE THERE ARE 
NOT ENOUGH TRAINED PEOPLE TO 
PROCESS APPLICATIONS INDIA'S 
BIGGEST RICE EXPORTER TILL D. A. IS 
WARNING THAT PRICES ARE SET TO RISE 
FURTHER OVER HALF OF ALL THE RICE 
EAT NO ONE THE U. K. IS BASMATTY WHICH

THE RESULTS OF RANK RANK OWN MECCA 
BINGO HALLS AND GROSVENOR CASINOS 
THEY SAY THE IMPACT OF THE SMOKING 
BAN LED TO CUT IN REVENUE OF EIGHT PER CENT 
THERE IS MY FAT LADY IN THE FIRST 
FOUR MONTHS OF THE YEAR 
NET GAINING REVENUE ROSE THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT IN THE 
FIRST QUARTER THE SHARES ARE DOWN 
NOTHING LIKE RANK BUT DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT 
LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE MORE 
WIDELY HELD SHARES THERE ARE 
FALLERS ANGLO AMERICAN CENTRICA 
GLAXO HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE 
REFLECTED IN THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED WE HAVE 
HAD RESULTS FROM INTERCONTINENTAL 
HOTELS ON ONE MEASURE THEY ARE THE 
BIGGEST HOTEL GROUP IN THE WORLD 
THEY OWN HOLIDAY INNS AND OTHER BIG 
BRANDS BRANDS THAT IS VERY INTERESTING TALKING 
ABOUT GLOBAL SLOWDOWN IN THE 
ECONOMY PEOPLE USING HOTELS 
ALTHOUGH I THINK A LOT OF THEIR 
BUSINESS COMES FROM BUSINESS TRAVEL 
AS OPPOSED TO LEISURE TRAVEL WHICH 
IS MORE RESILIENT THEIR SHARES ARE 
UP TWENTY FIVE PER CENT TODAY IT IS WELL PLACED 
FOR FURTHER GROWTH DESPITE 
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 
OPERATING PROFITS WERE FIFTY FIVE MILLION 
FOR THE THREE MONTHS TO THE END OF 
MARCH UP FROM FORTY FIVE THE YEAR BEFORE 
EASYJET UP THIRTY FOUR PER CENT MORE ON THAT LATER 
THERE HAS BEEN BOUNCE WHICH I 
WANT TO POINT YOU TOWARDS IN THE 
HOUSING SECTOR WHICH HAS BEEN ONE 
OF THE WORST PERFORMING SECTORS 
OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS PERSIMMON 
UP SIX PER CENT WOLSELEY THEY ARE UP FIFTY FIVE PER CENT 
THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IS UP FORTY THREE LOCK AT THAT 
A CLEAN SWEEP ALL THE MAJOR 
MARKETS OF THE WORLD ARE UP 
GOOD NEWS BUT THERE COULD BE 
ANOTHER DELAY IN THE ADOPTION OF 
HIPS THE CURRENT SITUATION IS HOME 
OWNERS ONLY HAVE TO ORDER HIP 
BEFORE SELLING THEIR PROPERTY THAT 
WAS DUE TO CHANGE AT THE END OF 
THIS MONTH WITH SELLERS FORCED TO 
PRODUCE FULL HIP NOW THERE ARE 
REPORTS THE GOVERNMENT HAS DELAYED 
THE SCHEME UNTIL THE END OF THIS 
YEAR BECAUSE OF THE SLOWDOWN IN 
HOUSE SALES THAT SOUND LIKE 
POTENTIAL SHALL FURTHER BLOW TO 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRAINED AS ENERGY 
ASSESS SORES JIM GILLESPIE IS FROM 
THE INSTITUTE OF DOMESTIC ENERGY 
ASSESSORS THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF 
SPECULATION IN THE PRESS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO POSTPONE 
IT AGAIN WHAT 
HAVE YOU HEARD I I HAVE LITERALLY COME FROM A MEETING 
THE HIP PROVIDERS THIS MORNING 
THIS WAS ON THE AGENDA ALTHOUGH 
THE GOVERNMENT HAVE NOT OFFICIALLY 
ANNOUNCED IT IT IS WIDELY THOUGHT 
THEY WILL PUSH THE DATE BACK TO THE 
END OF THIS YEAR 
IS THAT A 
DISASTER FOR YOU GUYS YOU HAVE 
ASSESS SORES WHO HAVE ASSESSORS 
WHO HAVE TRAINED THEY MUST BE 
BITING AT THE BIT AREN'T THEY THE THE IMPACT SHOULD NOT BE TOO SERIOUS 
IT WILL NOT AFFECT THE ORDERERING 
OF THE HIPS IF SOMEONE WANTS TO 
PUT THEIR HOUSE ON THE MARKET THEY 
CAN IMMEDIATELY DO SO SO LONG AS 
THE ESTATE AGENT ORDERS THE HIP 
THE HIP THE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE 
PREPARED IN ADVANCE 
JUST TO 
CLARIFY PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO ORDER 
THE FIRST PART DOES THE ENERGY 
ASSESSMENT HAVE TO BE WHEN YOU PUT 
THE WHEELS IN MOTION OR CAN IT BE 
DELAYED 
NO THAT CAN'T BE DELAYED DELAYED WHEN EVER YOU PUT YOUR HOUSE ON 
WITH THE ESTATE AGENT YOU MUST DO 
TWO THINGS NUMBER ONE YOU MUST 
ORDER THE HOME INFORMATION PACK 
AND SECONDLY AN INTEGRAL PART IS 
THE ENERGY PERFORMANCE CERTIFICATE 
ONCE THE ESTATE AGENT ORDERS A HIP 
ITS FOLLOWS THEY WILL GET THE 
ENERGY CERTIFICATE 
THE HIPS APPLY 
IN ENGLAND AND WALES OF COURSE 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF 
ASSESSORS YOUR INSTITUTION WAS 
WOISHED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF 
ASSESSORS ARE PEOPLE GOING TO BE 
DISAPPOINTED 
THE SHORT ANSWER IS DISAPPOINTED YES THE LAST TIME WE WERE ON YOUR 
PROGRAMME BACK IN NOVEMBER THERE 
WAS APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN 
THE SYSTEM NOW THE GOVERNMENT 
ESTIMATES RANGE FROM TWO THOUSAND TO THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
ENERGY ASSESSORS BEING REQUIRED IN 
TOTAL THE LATEST FIGURES AS OF THE 
FIRST APRIL FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
THERE ARE ACTUALLY OVER SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED 
DOMESTIC ENERGY ASSESSORS ACREDITED 
AND READY TO WORK SO THE MARKET IS 
SATURATED 
WITH THAT SITUATION AND SATURATED THE SLOWDOWN IN HOUSE PRICES WE ARE 
HEARING REPORTS THAT THE COST OF AN 
ASSESSMENT HAS DROPPED FROM ONE HUNDRED TO 
FORTY WILL THIS MEAN A BETTER DEAL 
FOR CONSUMERS 
THE ACTUAL COST OF THE CITY THE GET 
HAS BEEN DRIVEN DOWN THAT IS NOT 
BEING PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER 
CERTIFICATE THE WHOLE COST IS IN 
THE RANGE OF THREE HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WITH WITH THAT MANY YOU TENSE BY THE 
GOVERNMENT DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD 
BE SCRAPPED COMPLETELY U. TURNS 
I DO NOT THINK LABOUR WILL SCRAP 
THEM THE TORIES ARE SAYING THEY 
WILL HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO 
PROVE THAT HOME INFORMATION PACKS 
ARE WORKING AND A GREAT BIG THING 
FOR CONSUMERS 
STARTING A NEW 
BUSINESS WHILE BRINGING UP FIVE 
CHILDREN ON YOUR OWN AND BEING ON 
BENEFITS IS A TALL ORDER FOR ANYONE 
PENNY PALMER HAS DONE THAT WITH 
HELP FROM HIS BEEN AT THE JOBCENTRE 
PLUS SHE RUNS AN ENTERPRISE 
WORKING WITH HORSES 
BATTY IS NICE 
THAT IS NICE SHE HAS GOT HER 
EYES SHUT 
PENNY PALMER HAS SPENT 
HER LIFE AROUND HORSES NOW SHE HAS 
A BUSINESS HEALING THEM SHE IS NO 
ORDINARY HE LEFT FOOT THAT SHE USES 
A COMBINATION OF MASSAGE 
MANIPULATION AND HERBAL POTIONS 
CHELA THIS HORSE SUFFERS FROM 
ARTHRITIS HE HAS AN INFECTION IN 
HIS FOR IT TO HE IS GETTING A 
CONCOCTION OF MUSTARD VINEGAR AND 
HOT WATER FOOT PENNY 
SPECIALISES IN TREATMENTS WHICH 
HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN OVER THE 
CENTURIES 
IN THE OLDEN DAYS WHEN CENTURIES WHICH DOCTORS WERE PASSING OUT 
HERBAL REMEDIES AND MEDICINES 
PEOPLE USED TO KNOCK ON THEIR DOOR 
WE USED TO GET BURNT AT THE STAKE 
WITCHES WERE BURNT AT THE STAKE IF 
YOU WERE DROWNING YOU WHEN NOT A 
WITCH AND IF YOU DID YOU WERE 
MARIGOLDS ARE FANTASTIC 
BACK AT 
HER STABLES NEAR HUCKS NOT IN 
NOTTINGHAMSHIRE SHE IS GROWING THE 
HERBST SHE NEEDS HUCKNALL IT IS 
A REMARKABLE BUSINESS ALL THE MORE 
REMARKABLE FOR THE FACT THAT SHE 
HAS BUILT IT UP AS A SINGLE MOTHER

INCOME SUPPORT SHE IS ON A SCHEME 
RUN BY JOBCENTRE PLUS UNDER THE 
NEW DEAL SHE GETS A BUSINESS 
ADVISER AND THE CHANCE TO SET UP A 
BUSINESS ON A TRIAL BASIS WITHOUT

DESIGNED TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE PENNY 
SETTING UP ON HER OWN 
IT SHOWS 
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE ONCE YOU HAVE 
THE INCLINATION TO DO THINGS THE 
SUPPORT IS THERE WHEN PEOPLE WANT 
TO MAKE THAT MOVE FORWARD I I PRESUME IT CHANGES LIVES OF IT IT DOES IT HAS CHANGED PENNY'S LIFE 
ONE OF THE PLEASURES IS THAT YOU 
SEE SO MANY PEOPLE PENNY THEY 
MIGHT HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT SOMETHING 
AND WE CAN SUPPORT THEM TO ACHIEVE 
THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
FOR IDEAS SHE TREATED HER OWN AND 
FRIENDS' HORSES NOW SHE CHARGES 
BETWEEN FORTY POINT FOUR OH FIVE 
I THOUGHT I 
WOULD BE STUCK WITH FIVE KIDS IN 
THE HOUSE AND HAVING TO SORT MY OWN 
HORSES OUT L. THOUGHT I WOULD SIT 
AT HOME AND BE MISERABLE L. DID 
NEVER THINK THIS WOULD HAPPEN YOU YOU HAVE HAD A CAMERA CREW AROUND AND 
IT HAS NOT BOTHERED TO 
I WOULD NOT 
HAVE WANTED TO TALK L. WOULD HAVE 
BEEN AT HOME L. WOULD HAVE BEEN 
WATCHING THE TELEVISION RATHER THAN 
BEING HONOURED L. WAS NOT THAT SORT 
OF A PERSON L. WAS QUIET BECAUSE I 
AM PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS I WANT TO 
GET OUT THERE AND DO MORE AND MORE 
AND MORE OF IT L. LOVE IT TEN TEN MONTHS AFTER SETTING UP IN THE 
BUSINESS COME AT A PENNY HAS 
TREATED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED COURSES 
PENNY WILL PRICES HIT ANOTHER 
RECORD HIGH BRENT CRUDE DID GO 
OVER THAT MARK OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A BARREL 
BEFORE COMING DOWN THE PRICE IS 
NOW EIGHTY PER CENT HIGHER OVER THE PAST YEAR 
IT IS A MASSIVE RISE IT INCREASES 
PETROL PRICES THE RISE IN OIL AND 
METAL PRICES HAVE DISTORTED WHAT 
HAS HAPPENED ON THE STOCK 
THE STOCK MARKET IS MADE UP OF 
LOTS OF DIFFERENT SECTORS THERE 
ARE BIG RETAILERS TESCO IS THE 
BIGGEST OF THE LOT THERE ARE OTHER 
FAMOUS NAMES SUCH AS M. AND AMP S. AND NEXT 
THE BANKS ARE VERY IMPORTANT AS 
WELL THE H. S. B. C. ACCOUNTS FOR SIXTY PER CENT 
THAT COMPANY IS THE SECOND BIGGEST 
ON THE WHOLE OF THE STOCK MARKET 
THE RISE IN OIL PRICES AND MINERAL 
PRICES HAS HAD A HUGE EFFECT ON 
MINING AND OIL AFFAIR SHARES 
THIS HAS HAD A BIG EFFECT WAS THAT 
THE STOCK MARKET IS DOING 
RELATIVELY WELL APART DESPITE ALL 
THE TALK OF PROBLEMS IN THE ECONOMY 
THE OVERALL FIGURES HIDES NASTY 
TROUBLESPOTS THERE I GO LEGLESS 
AS ALWAYS THIS IS WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED TO THE F. T. S. E. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY IT 
DESPITE DESPITE THE BLIP WE HAVE 
SEEN OVER THERE IN RECENT TIMES IT 
HAS STILL MANAGED A DECENT RISE FIFTY FIVE 
PER CENT IN VALUE IT HAS PICKED ITSELF UP 
FROM THOSE RECENT LOWS THAT IS 
GOOD NEWS THE OIL AND MINING 
SHARES ARE HUGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR 
MUCH OF THAT RISE AS A WHOLE THE 
MARKET HAS RISEN BY FIFTY FIVE PER CENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE 
THE MINING AND OIL SECTOR HAS 
WRITTEN RISEN BY OVER FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT 
CURRENTLY THOSE SECTORS TOGETHER 
ACCOUNT FOR TWELVE PER CENT OF THE F. T. S. E. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
IF YOU IGNORE THE OIL AND MINING 
SECTORS THINGS WOULD LOOK VERY 
DIFFERENT INDEED 
WHOLE OF 
THE STOCK MARKET NOT ONLY THAT 
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE BEST 
PERFORMING SHARES IN THE LAST FEW 
YEARS HAS BEEN IN MINING BOUGHT 
WILSHERE LOOK AT WHAT THEY HAVE 
DONE THAT IS OVER ONE THOUSAND PER CENT UP IN 
FIVE YEARS IT LOOKS LIKE THINGS 
ARE DOING VERY WELL IT IS NOT TRUE 
AT THE SAME TIME BANKS HAVE LOST A 
HUGE PART OF THEIR VALUE A LOT 
HAVE LOST A THIRD OF THEIR VALUE 
THAT HIS BILLIONS OF POUNDS BEING 
WIPED OFF KINGFISHER IS THE WORST 
PERFORMER IS FOR A LOT OF 
PEOPLE THE F. T. S. E. IS NOT BIG GOOD 
REFLECTION OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO 
MANY OF THEIR INVESTMENTS THINGS 
ARE A LOT WORSE THAN THEY APPEARED 
TO BE EARLIER EXPECTED HENK POTTS 
OF BARCLAYS STOCKBROKERS AND ASKED 
FOR HIS OPINION I 
OF BARCLAYS STOCKBROKERS AND ASKED FOR HIS OPINION I 
SPOKE I THINK 
I THINK THE F. T. S. E. WOULD BE LOOKING IN A FAR 
WORSE STATE WE HAVE SEEN A BIG 
SELL OFF IN BANKING AND RETAIL 
BECAUSE OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH THAT 
HAS BEEN OFFSET BY A STUNNING 
PERFORMANCE FROM COMMODITIES AND 
THE OIL SECTOR COMMODITY PRICES 
HAVE RISEN DRAMATICALLY WE ARE 
SEEING AN EXPLOSIVE PERFORMANCE ON 
THE MINING SECTOR BOYLE HAS 
REACHED RECORD LEVELS MORE RECENTLY 
ONCE AGAIN IT IS SHOWING THE 
IMPORTANCE OF HER IN A BALANCED 
PORTFOLIO 
HAVING FOR THOSE PORTFOLIO PEOPLE INVESTING IN TRACKERS I 
DOUBT THEY CARE WHETHER INDIVIDUAL 
SECTORS HAVE GONE UP OR DOWN 
BECAUSE OVERALL THE INDEX HAS DONE 
RATHER WELL 
EASYJET HAS ANNOUNCED LOSSES IN THE 
FIRST OF THE YEAR OF FIFTY SEVEN MILLION 
IT IS BLAMING THE RISE IN OIL 
PRICES FOR THE LOSSES AS THE COST 
OF OIL CONTINUES TO RISE AND WE 
SEEM TO HAVE LESS SPARE CASH ARE 
THEY ARE TOUGH TIMES AHEAD YOU 
HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE SITUATION 
A LOT OF COMPETITION WITH THE 
AIRLINES HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS 
TO EASYJET 
IT IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT 
MAKING A LOSS IN THE FIRST SIX 
MONTHS OF THE YEAR THIS SIX MONTH 
PERIOD IS NOT UNCOMMON IN THE 
AVIATION INDUSTRY MOST AIRLINES 
EXPECT TO MAKE THEIR PROFIT DURING 
THE BUSY SUMMER MONTHS A STICK 
EASYJET LAST SEVENTEEN POINT ONE MILLION LAST 
YEAR WITHIN THE FIFTY SEVEN MILLION THERE 
IS NINE MILLION WORTH OF COSTS 
INVOLVED IN EASYJET'S BY OUT OF G. B. 
AIRWAYS BACK IN OCTOBER WHAT IS 
INTERESTING IS THAT PASSENGER 
NUMBERS HAVE ACTUALLY INCREASED IN 
THE LAST SIX MONTHS THEY HAD 
CARRIED NINETY MILLION PASSENGERS WHICH 
IS UP FIFTEEN PER CENT OVER LAST YEAR THAT IS 
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE 
INCREASED THEIR FLEET BY TWENTY 
AIRCRAFT THE PASSENGER LOAD IS AT 
EIGHTY PER CENT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT FOR 
EVERY ONE HUNDRED SEATS THEY FLIGHT AROUND 
EIGHTY OF THEM ARE FULFIL STOP EASYJET 
A SAME DAY BOOKINGS FOR THIS SOME 
ARE SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF NEXT YEAR 
FOUR 
WHAT ARE THE UNDERLYING FOUR REASONS FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN 
PERFORMANCE 
PASSENGER NUMBERS ARE PERFORMANCE UP AND THEY HAVE GOT A BIGGER FLEET 
WHILE THEY ARE LOSING MONEY ONE 
REASON IS THE STRENGTH OF THE EURO 
THAT IS IMPACTING ON THAT AIRLINE 
COSTS AND CREWING COSTS AND 
STAFFING COSTS THERE WAS CONCERN 
OVER THE CREDIT PUNT CREDIT 
CRUNCH IN THE U. K. AND WHETHER THAT 
WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT WHETHER WE 
WOULD BE LESS WILLING TO PAY FOR A 
WEEKEND ABROAD THAT DOES NOT SEEM 
TO BE THE CASE FOR EASYJET 
PASSENGER NUMBERS ARE UP THEY SAY 
THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED A DROP IN 
DEMAND THE BIG ISSUE IS THE RISING 
COST OF FUEL AVERAGE FUEL COSTS 
OVER THE LAST YEAR BACK IN APRIL 
IT WAS SIX HUNDRED FIFTY SIX DOLLARS A TONNE END OCTOBER 
IT HAD RISEN TO EIGHT HUNDRED TEN DOLLARS A TONNE BY 
LAST MONTH IT WAS ONE THOUSAND FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS A TONNE 
THAT IS AN INCREASE OF SEVENTY SIX PER CENT 
EASYJET HAVE BEEN QUITE BULLISH 
ABOUT THIS THEY SAY THIS IS NOT 
THOUGHT TO CAUSE ANY SERIOUS 
PROBLEMS THE THEIR VALUE ON THE 
STOCK MARKET PERHAPS IS NOT SO 
CONFIDENT BUT THEIR VALUE IT 
DID RALLY SLIGHTLY THIS MORNING IT 
HAD A HIGH IN OCTOBER AND THAT HAS 
FALLEN TODAY'S PRICE IS AROUND 
THREE HAD AN EIGHT PENCE PER SHARE 
THE RISING FUEL PRICES ARE NOT 
EXCLUSIVE TO EASYJET 
THAT SHARE 
PRICE PATTERN WE HAVE JUST SEEN 
FROM EASYJET IS CLOSELY MIRRORED BY 
THE SHARE PRICE PATTERN OF BRITISH 
AIRWAYS YOU MIGHT NOTHING TO 
COMPARE THE NO FRILLS CAREER WITH 
THE NATIONAL FLY CAREER EARLIER I 
SPOKE TO SOMEONE ABOUT THE RISING 
FUEL COSTS 
THE HIGHER OIL PRICE IS 
VERY MUCH AN INDUSTRY WIDE ISSUE 
IT IS NOT CONFINED JUST TO BE LOW 
COST SECTOR WE HAVE SEEN 
BANKRUPTCY IS A LOST THE BROUGHT 
THE STOCK ACROSS THE BOARD 
SEVERAL LOW COST CARRIERS IN THE U. S. 
MARKET AND EVEN IN THE PREMIUM 
BUSINESS MARKETS COMPANIES SUCH AS 
MAXJET AND EOS HAVE GONE BUST 
THESE STRONG PLAYERS ARE THOSE THAT 
HAVE LARGE CASH RESOURCES THEY 
SURVIVE FOR THE LONG TERM OTHERS 
WILL MOST LIKELY GO BANKRUPT AL 
ITALIA IS A TRADITIONAL AIRLINE IN 
EUROPE IT IS IN A PERILOUS 
FINANCIAL STATE AT THE MOMENT IN 
TIME WE WILL SEE OTHER FAILURES 
THE PRESSURE IS ON WHAT IS EASYJET 
AND OTHER COMPANIES DOING 
WE ARE 
USING MORE EFFICIENT AIRCRAFT THIS 
IS OUR PLANE WITH ITS GO FASTER 
STRIPE ON THE SIDE YOUR IMMEDIATE 
REACTION IS NOT GOING TO BE TO GATT 
AND BUY A NEW FLEET EASYJET AND 
RYANAIR HAD ALREADY INVESTED IN 
NEW CRAFT A NEED A BETTER DEAL 
WITH CATERERS AND PERHAPS WITH 
LANDING CHARGES THEY NEED THEY 
ARE REDUCING ANCILLARY COSTS 
CHARGING US TO CHECK IN BAGGAGE FOR 
ASKING PEOPLE TO PAY FOR SPEEDY 
BOARDING OR PRIORITY BOARDING THE 
LAST THING THEY ARE DOING IS 
ACTUALLY FLYING MORE SLOWLY IF THE 
CREW IF THE AIRCRAFT CREWS AT IS 
SLIGHTLY SLOWER SPEED IT WILL 
CONSERVE FUEL AIR TRAFFIC 
CONTROLLERS CANNOT LET EVERYONE 
SLOWED DOWN OR THEY WILL HAVE A 
HUGE BACKLOG 
THANK YOU FOR PUTTING 
HAS BEEN A PICTURE OF WE WILL BE 
BACK AT THE NORMAL TIME OF TWELVE THIRTY P. M. 
TOMORROW GOODBYE FOR NOW
