IN A GARDEN JUST LIKE THIS 
THERE WAS A DOG CALLED DOTTIE 
DOTTIE LOVED GARDENING 
SHE WAS ALWAYS DIGGING AND PLANTING SEEDS 
BUT DOTTIE'S MOTHER AND FATHER WERE REALLY FED UP WITH IT 
WHILE DOTTIE WAS HAPPILY GARDENING 
DOTTIE'S FATHER CAME OUT AND SAW HER 
STOP THAT AT ONCE HE SAID ANGRILY 
WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG ASKED DOTTIE 
DOGS SHOULD PLAY AT RUNNING AROUND LOOKING FOR BONES 
NOT GARDENING 
OH 
SAID DOTTIE 
DOTTIE DECIDED SHE WANTED TO CARRY ON GARDENING 
SHE COLLECTED HER POTS 
AND TOOK THEM INTO THE HOUSE 
AND THERE DOTTIE SETTLED DOWN 
TO CONTINUE GARDENING 
DOTTIE'S MOTHER SAW HER 
LOOK AT MY CARPET CRIED MOTHER IT'S COVERED IN MUD 
I WANT ALL THIS OUT 
DOTTIE'S MOTHER AND FATHER WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HER 
YOU CAN'T DO GARDENING 
I CAN DECLARED DOTTIE 
GO AND DO WHAT ALL DOGS DO 
CHASE A POSTMAN 
FED UP DOTTIE WENT OFF 
AT FIRST DOTTIE WAS ANGRY 
BUT SHE SOON CHEERED UP 
SHE SAW HER FRIEND DUCK 
DUCK WAS ROLLER SKATING 
DOTTIE WATCHED HIM A LITTLE PUZZLED 
DUCKS DON'T ROLLER SKATE SAID DOTTIE 
DON'T THEY SAID DUCK 
I DO AND HE ROLLER SKATED AWAY 
DOTTIE WATCHED HIM SKATE AWAY 
THEN DECIDED TO VISIT HER FRIEND RABBIT 
ON THE WAY TO RABBIT'S HOUSE SHE NOTICED CAT 
ON HER SAILING BOAT 
DOTTIE LOOKED AT CAT WITH AMAZEMENT 
DOTTIE WENT UP TO HAVE A WORD WITH CAT HELLO SAID CAT 
I THOUGHT CATS DIDN'T LIKE WATER BECAUSE THEY GOT WET SAID DOTTIE 
OH DON'T THEY SAID CAT 
I DO I LIKE WATER 
AND SHE SAILED OFF 
DOTTIE WATCHED HER PUZZLED 
CAT SAILED AWAY 
AND DOTTIE CONTINUED ON TO RABBIT'S HOUSE 
WHEN SHE ARRIVED SHE WENT INSIDE 
HELLO SHE CALLED 
OH HELLO DO COME IN SAID RABBIT 
RABBIT WAS BUSY MIXING COLOURED PAINTS 
DOTTIE WATCHED HIM PUZZLED 
RABBIT BEGAN TO PAINT A PICTURE 
YOU CAN'T PAINT SAID DOTTIE 
RABBITS DON'T PAINT PICTURES 
DON'T THEY SAID RABBIT 
I DO 
AND CARRIED ON PAINTING 
THIS MADE DOTTIE VERY THOUGHTFUL 
SHE THOUGHT ABOUT THE THINGS THAT RABBIT CAT AND DUCK WERE DOING 
SUDDENLY SHE FELT BETTER ABOUT THINGS AND DECIDED TO GO HOME 
THE NEXT NIGHT FATHER HEARD A NOISE AND WOKE UP WITH A START 
HE QUICKLY WOKE MOTHER 
I CAN HEAR A NOISE HE SAID 
THEY BOTH PRICKED UP THEIR EARS AND LISTENED 
IT COULD BE A BURGLAR DOWNSTAIRS SAID MOTHER 
SO ARM IN ARM THEY CAUTIOUSLY CREPT DOWNSTAIRS 
IT WAS DARK 
SO THEY LIT TORCHES 
AND PEERED AROUND 
THEY WENT INTO THE GARDEN 
AND THERE THEY SAW DOTTIE HAPPILY GARDENING 
THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN DISMAY 
DOTTIE LOOKED AT HER PARENTS SHEEPISHLY 
GO TO BED IMMEDIATELY SAID FATHER 
YES THIS MINUTE SAID MOTHER 
DOTTIE'S EARS WENT BACK 
HER TAIL WE NT DOWN 
BUT THEY CONTINUED 
DOTTIE 
DOGS NEVER GARDEN

DEJECTED DOTTIE SLINKED OFF 
TO BED 
MOTHER AND FATHER WENT TO BED TOO 
BUT THEY COULDN'T SLEEP 
THEY TOSSED AND TURNED THINKING THINGS OVER 
FATHER KEPT WAKING UP HE WOKE MOTHER 
DOTTIE'S ALWAYS GARDENING HE COMPLAINED 
BUT DOTTIE REALLY DOES LOVE GARDENING SAID MOTHER

SOON IT WAS DOTTIE'S BIRTHDAY 
AND SHE INVITED DUCK CAT 
AND RABBIT TO HER PARTY 
THEY GORGED THEMSELVES ON CAKE AND LEMONADE 
AND SOON THEY WERE QUITE FULL 
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY OUTSIDE DOTTIE ASKED

WHEN THEY WENT OUTSIDE DOTTIE SAW A LARGE PRESENT

RABBIT LOOKED AT THE PRESENTS IN AMAZEMENT
