WE'RE GOING TO BE MEETING SOME VERY AGITATED GORILLAS 
BUT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF SOMEONE KEPT BANGING ON YOUR WINDOW 
AND OUR ROAR RANGER IS ALMOST OVERCOME BY SOME AWFUL SMELLING POO 
IT'S DISGUSTING SNIFF 
NO IT SMELLS TOO MUCH 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO ROAR I'M MATT 
AND I'M RANI AND WE'RE HERE AT THE DISCOVERY ZONE TO MEET A CHAMELEON 
RANI WHY HAVE YOU GOT A PARTY WHISTLE 
IT'S THE PERFECT WAY TO EXPLAIN HOW A CHAMELEON'S TONGUE WORKS 
IT KEEPS IT COILED UP IN ITS MOUTH AND THEN WHEN IT SEES ITS PREY 
IT CAN SHOOT IT OUT UP TO SPEEDS OF FIVE MILES PER SECOND 
CATCHES ITS PREY ROLLS IT BACK IN AND THEN IT CAN EAT IT SPECTACULAR 
DID YOU KNOW THAT CHAMELEONS HAVE THE LONGEST TONGUE 
IN THE REPTILE FAMILY 
WE'VE BEEN CALLED DOWN TO A MEDICAL EMERGENCY 
IN THE PARK'S SMALL CAT SECTION 
COLLEGIE THE CARACAL HAS BEEN SPOTTED WITH A MYSTERIOUS 
GAPING WOUND IN HER SIDE AND NEEDS HELP FAST 
KEEPER NEVILLE BUCK IS WAITING FOR THE VET TO ARRIVE 
JANE'S SHOULD BE HERE IN JUST A FEW MINUTES 
IT'LL GIVE US JUST ENOUGH TIME TO ASSESS THE SITUATION 
DECIDE WHAT TO DO 
WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER FEMALE CARACAL 
IN THERE WITH HER 
WE WANT TO TRY AND AVOID HER GETTING A LITTLE BIT CROSS 
AND ATTACKING US WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO TREAT COLLEGIE 
CARACALS LIKE COLLEGIE COME FROM AFRICA AND WESTERN ASIA 
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL CATS OFTEN CALLED THE DESERT LYNX 
BECAUSE OF THEIR TUFTED EARS 
NO ONE KNOWS HOW COLLEGIE FIRST GOT HER WOUND 
BUT IT'S LARGE AND LOOKS VERY PAINFUL 
OUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE JANE THE VET'S TURNED UP 
SHE NEEDS NEVILLE AND HIS COLLEAGUE RICH'S HELP TO CATCH COLLEGIE 
THEY'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL 
INJURED ANIMALS CAN BE FRIGHTENED AND VERY DANGEROUS 
O. K. 
RIGHT 
THEY'VE NETTED HER JANE MOVES IN TO TRANQUILLISE COLLEGIE 
THEY NEED TO KEEP HER CALM 
TO AVOID OPENING HER WOUND EVEN FURTHER 
THERE WE ARE IT'S GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL A BIT SLEEPY 
AND THEN WE CAN STITCH YOU UP 
IT'S A CASE OF RESTRICTING HER MOVEMENT 
WE DON'T WANT THAT BASHING AROUND TOO MUCH 
IN CASE SHE OPENS UP THAT WOUND ANY MORE 
WE'LL JUST DROP HER INTO THE BOX AND WE CAN START MOVING HER AWAY 
WE'LL LEAVE HER IN THE NET 
COLLEGIE MIGHT BE SEDATED BUT SHE'S IN PAIN AND VERY ANGRY 
GOOD 
SHE'S TRANQUILLISED AND SECURED 
AND MUST GET TO THE OPERATING TABLE 
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
WE'LL CATCH UP WITH THEM LATER ON 
GO ON DO SOMETHING 
COME ON 
DON'T JUST SIT THERE LOOK AT YOU ALL RELAXED JUST WATCHING TELLY 
IT'S NOT VERY NICE WHEN SOMEONE COMES ALONG 
AND BANGS ON THE GLASS AND ASKS YOU TO DO THINGS 
WELL THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME DOWN HERE AT PALACE OF THE APES 
I'M HERE TO MEET PHIL RIDGES WHO'S HEAD OF SECTION 
YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME A MASTERCLASS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH GORILLAS 
AND HOW TO INTERACT WITH THEM YES 
IF I CAME ALONG AND I BANGED ON THE GLASS 
HOW DO THEY FEEL ABOUT THAT 
MOST OF THE TIME NOT VERY HAPPY 
SOME PEOPLE DO DO IT IN A PLAYFUL WAY 
BUT A LOT OF THE TIME GORILLAS 
YOU KNOW MISINTERPRET THAT AS YOU KNOW AS AGGRESSION SOMETIMES 
HE BANGED ON THE GLASS AND I GOT SCARED 
IT'S QUITE A LOUD SOUND 
WHY WOULD HE HAVE DONE THAT TO US HERE 
WELL FOR A START HE DOESN'T LIKE THE FILM CREW 
RIGHT BAD PEOPLE 
HE'S GOT VERY REAL A REAL HATE OF THE FILM CREWS THAT COME HERE 
AND ALSO HE JUST GETS ANNOYED SOMETIMES AT VERY LOUD PEOPLE 
AND USUALLY VERY BRASH PEOPLE 
IF YOU COME HERE AND IF YOU'RE VERY RELAXED 
AND JUST TAKE THE GORILLAS FOR WHAT THEY ARE 
THEY'RE WONDERFUL ANIMALS AND JUST WATCH THEM IN A NICE WAY 
THEN YOU KNOW JALA WILL BE VERY CALM HIMSELF 
THAT'S JALA THE BIG GUY WHO STANDS UP AND OH 
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA HIT THE GLASS 
WHEN HE HITS THE GLASS IS HE BEING AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS US YES 
WHEN GORILLAS ARE AGGRESSIVE 
THEY PURSE THEIR LIPS BRING THEIR LIPS IN LIKE THIS 
I'VE SEEN THEM DO THAT AND THEY GET VERY STIFF 
VERY STIFF STANCE ON ALL FOURS AND JUST MAKE THEMSELVES 
LOOK BIG AND IMPRESSIVE 
THIS ONE HE SEEMS QUITE HAPPY FOR US TO BE HERE 
YEAH I MEAN HE'S A YOUNGSTER 
HE PERCEIVES YOU AS NO THREAT 
JALA HAS GOT A BIT OF A HISTORY AS FAR AS PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ANYWAY 
COS HE WAS ACTUALLY RESCUED OH RIGHT 
SO HE HAD A VERY BAD START 
SO HE HAS REASON TO FEAR HUMAN BEINGS 
OR NOT LIKE HUMANS HE DOESN'T FEAR THEM ANY MORE 
HE KNOWS HE'S BIGGER THAN US AND STRONGER THAN US 
AND HE WAS VERY BADLY TREATED WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG 
BASICALLY HIS FAMILY WERE KILLED 
AND HE WOULD HAVE ENDED UP DEAD IF HE WASN'T ACTUALLY RESCUED 
IT'S GREAT THAT HE'S HERE NOW NICE AND SAFE 
JALA LOOKS LIKE HE'S CALMED DOWN BUT EARLIER HE BANGED THE GLASS 
NONE OF THE OTHERS WERE DOING THAT SO WHY WOULD IT JUST BE HIM 
JALA'S THE DOMINANT MALE IN THE GROUP 
IT'S HIS ROLE TO PROTECT HIS GROUP 
HE'LL PROTECT THEM FROM OTHER RIVAL MALES FROM OUTSIDE THE GROUP 
AND MAYBE WANT TO TRY AND STEAL SOME FEMALES AND 
YOU KNOW ALMOST LIKE A LION PRIDE 
O. K. OUTSIDE LIONS COME IN TO TRY 
AND SEE OFF THE EXISTING MALE OF A GROUP OF FEMALES 
AND BASICALLY THEY WANT TO HAVE A FAMILY 
OF THEIR OWN 
AND STEAL FEMALES 
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BANG THE GLASS HARD THEN 
I'VE LEARNT SO MUCH TODAY ABOUT GORILLAS 
BUT BEFORE I GO THREE TIPS FROM YOUR MASTERCLASS TODAY 
WELL FIRSTLY BE AS QUIET AS POSSIBLE O. K. 
DON'T RUN UP AND DOWN TOO MUCH O. K. 
AND DEFINITELY DON'T BANG THE GLASS 
YOU HEARD IT HERE FROM THE MAN THANK YOU SO MUCH PHIL 
WHAT DO SNAKES USE TO CUT PAPER 
I DON'T KNOW 
SSSS SCISSORS 
THAT IS STUPID BUT FUNNY 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CAT THAT SWALLOWED A BALL OF WOOL 
SHE HAD MITTENS 
WHEN IS IT BAD LUCK TO SEE A BLACK CAT 
I DON'T KNOW 
WHEN YOU'RE A MOUSE 
SO YOU'VE LEARNT ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT GORILLA ETIQUETTE 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GRILL ANOTHER KEEPER ABOUT THESE GUYS 
THE PARK'S SUMATRAN TIGERS 
THEY COME FROM ONE OF THE LARGEST ISLANDS IN INDONESIA 
AND BEN WARREN IS ONE OF THEIR KEEPERS 
I'VE HEADED DOWN WITH THE ROAR CREW TO SEE IF HE REALLY 
KNOWS HIS ANIMALS 
SO WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST 
HANDS UP BEN YOU CAN CHOOSE 
MATTHEW DO TIGERS SWIM YEAH TIGERS ARE VERY GOOD SWIMMERS 
SUMATRAN TIGERS COME FROM WET AREAS 
SO THEY GO INTO MARSH AREAS RIVERS 
THEY LIKE TO COOL OFF WHEN THEY'RE IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY 
SO THEY'LL FIND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER 
JUMP AND COOL THEMSELVES DOWN MAYBE GO FOR A SWIM 
BUT TIGERS DON'T REALLY LIKE VERY DEEP WATER 
SO THEY'LL STAY AWAY FROM REALLY DEEP WATER 
SO THEY LIKE A PADDLE 
YEAH NOT A LONG DISTANCE SWIM NOT REALLY VERY GOOD 
GO ISABELLE WHAT DO YOU CALL A GROUP OF TIGERS 
TIGERS ARE SOLITARY IN THE WILD 
SO THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A GROUP OF TIGERS 
MALES WANDER AROUND ALONE WITH THEIR TERRITORY 
THEY'LL MEET UP WITH A FEMALE WHEN THEY NEED TO 
AND THEN GO OFF AGAIN SO THEY DON'T HANG AROUND IN GROUPS 
GOODNESS ME NOT THE MOST SOCIABLE CATS THEN NO 
WHO ELSE HAS GOT A QUESTION MILLIE 
WHAT'S THE TIGERS' FAVOURITE FOOD 
WELL TIGERS ARE CARNIVORES WHICH MEANS THEY EAT MEAT 
THEY DON'T EAT FRUIT AND VEG OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
SO THEIR FAVOURITE FOOD IS A BIT OF MEAT 
THAT WILL GIVE THEM EVERYTHING FOR THEIR FEED 
VERY GOOD AND 
YOU HAVEN'T ASKED A QUESTION YET HAVE YOU GOT ONE DIVE IN 
WHAT'S THEIR FAVOURITE PLACE TO SNOOZE 
WELL TIGERS ARE VERY LAZY UNLESS THEY'RE OUT HUNTING 
THEY SLEEP MOST OF THEIR TIME SO THEY'D FIND A NICE 
LITTLE SPOT UNDER A TREE OUT OF THE SUN AND SHADE 
WHERE THEY CAN JUST QUIETLY NAP FOR SEVERAL HOURS OF THE DAY 
ISABEL WHAT'S THE AVERAGE SIZE OF A TIGER'S CANINE 
WELL TIGERS' CANINES THEY SHOW ABOUT FIVE CENTIMETRES 
OUTSIDE THE JAW AND THERE'S FIVE CENTIMETRES IN THE JAW 
SO IT'S ABOUT TEN CENTIMETRES LONG WHICH IS VERY LONG 
THAT IS A HUGE TOOTH TEN CENTIMETRES ANY MORE QUESTIONS 
MILLIE 
IF CHEETAHS ARE THE FASTEST ANIMALS HOW FAST ARE TIGERS 
CHEETAHS ARE VERY FAST TIGERS AREN'T AS FAST AS CHEETAHS OBVIOUSLY 
TIGERS YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AROUND THIRTY FIVE FORTY MILES AN HOUR 
SO THAT'S STILL VERY FAST 
WELL BEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
SOME BRILLIANT ANSWERS HAVE YOU ALL LEARNT LOADS ABOUT SUMATRAN TIGERS 
YEAH EXCELLENT 
TODAY'S ROAR RANGER IS JACK FROM CHARLTON 
HE'S GOING TO BE HELPING OUT THE KEEPERS AT PORT LYMPNE 
WITH LOADS OF COOL ANIMALS 
THEY'RE PRICKLY SPIKY AND THEY'RE I SUPPOSE A BIT VICIOUS YEAH 
THESE PORCUPINES ARE FROM AFRICA 
AND ARE THE LARGEST KIND OF PORCUPINES IN THE WORLD 
THEY'VE GOT REALLY SPIKY QUILLS SHARP CLAWS AND STRONG TEETH 
AND THEY'RE GRUMPY 
NO WONDER JACK'S WORRIED BUT IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THEM HE LIKES 
NOT REALLY NO 
OH DEAR PERHAPS JACK WILL LIKE THEM MORE WHEN HE'S GOT TO KNOW THEM 
BUT FIRST HE NEEDS TO MEET THEIR KEEPER MATT CRITTENDON 
HELLO HELLO YOU'VE COME TO HELP ME FOR THE DAY YEAH 
I'M MATT AND THESE ARE THE PORCUPINES 
AND WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO IS WE'VE GOT TO GOING HERE 
AND WE'VE GOT TO CLEAN THEM OUT 
SO ARE YOU READY TO SHOVEL A BIT OF POO 
YEAH COME ON THEN 
THAT'S NOT VERY ENTHUSIASTIC JACK 
RIGHT THERE YOU GO JACK 
THIS IS THE PORCUPINE SHED WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE SMELL 
IT STINKS 
I QUITE LIKE THE SMELL IT JUST SINKS CRAZY 
THE SHED'S KEPT NICE AND WARM FOR THE PORCUPINES 
HEAT AND WEE DOESN'T MAKE A SWEET SMELLING COMBINATION 
DO YOU WANT A SNIFF 
OH NO HE'S GOING TO BE SICK 
THERE'S LITRES OF PORCUPINE WEE SOAKED INTO THAT STEAMING SAWDUST 
I CAN BARELY BREATHE 
COME ON JACK IT'S NOT THAT BAD IS IT 
THE THING IS WITH THIS 
IS THEY DON'T ANY NUMBER TWOS IN HERE 
THEY DO ALL THEM OUTSIDE UNFORTUNATELY 
SO THERE'S GROSSER THINGS TO COME FOR JACK 
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THESE TWO YOUNGSTERS 
HAVE GOT THE HUMP WITH HIM AS WELL 
WHY ARE THEY MAKING SO MUCH NOISE 
THEY'RE SHAKING THEIR TAILS AND STAMPING THEIR FEET TO LET YOU KNOW 
YOU NEED TO KEEP AWAY FROM THEM 
THAT'S AN ANGRY THING 
RIGHT LET'S PUT SOME FRESH BEDDING DOWN FOR THEM 
THEY DON'T LIKE THAT 
THEY'RE FURIOUS WATCH OUT JACK 
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO GO OUTSIDE AND GET SOME FRESH AIR 
BIGGER THAN THE ONES INSIDE AREN'T THEY YEAH 
PORCUPINE QUILLS CAN BE HALF A METRE LONG 
AND THEY EACH HAVE THOUSANDS OF THEM 
THEY RUN BACKWARDS INTO THEIR ATTACKERS 
AND THEN THEY LEAVE THEM WITH A FACE FULL OF VERY SHARP QUILLS 
OUCH 
LET'S GET THEM INSIDE THEIR HUT AND CONCENTRATE ON THE IMPORTANT WORK 
PORCUPINE TOILET WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT 
DISGUSTING 
SO WHAT WE HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP I'M AFRAID SO YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO USE YOUR HANDS 
OR THE DUSTPAN DUSTPAN YEAH 
WE DO THIS EVERY DAY AS WELL 
IS THAT ACTUALLY POO YEAH 
AND ALSO THEY'VE GOT ANOTHER PILE OVER THERE 
AND THEN ANOTHER PILE RIGHT DOWN THE OTHER END THERE 
IT'S DISGUSTING 
IT LOOKS AND SMELLS NO IT SMELLS TOO MUCH 
IT LOOKS AND SMELLS DISGUSTING 
THAT'S POO PILE NUMBER ONE DONE 
BUT THERE'S PLENTY MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM 
POO PILE NUMBER TWO 
OVER TO YOU JACK 
DID YOU THINK BEING A ZOO KEEPER WOULD BE ALL FUN AND GAMES 
YEAH ALL CUDDLING MONKEYS AND 
YEAH THINGS LIKE THAT 
WELL UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS WHAT WE DO MOST OF THE DAY 
ALMOST LIKE POO KEEPERS 
YEAH 
POO KEEPER THAT'S NOT WHAT JACK SIGNED UP TO BE 
HOW MUCH DO THEY EAT A DAY 
THEY GET TWO BUCKETS FULL OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES A DAY 
ONE THING WE KNOW IS THAT WHATEVER THEY EAT IT MAKES THEM POO A LOT 
YEAH 
I THINK I MIGHT NEED A BIGGER BAG 
HOW CAN THEY POO SO MUCH 
I DON'T THINK THIS IS PORCUPINES 
I THINK AN ELEPHANT'S BEEN IN HERE 
WE'RE GETTING THERE YEAH 
THAT'S A DAY'S WORTH OF PORCUPINE POO 
ALL SHOVELLED UP BY YOU 
WELL DONE JACK 
OR SHOULD I SAY WELL DUNG 
I RECKON YOU DID A GOOD JOB SHOVELLING UP ALL THAT POO 
I REALLY DO SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AROUND 
SEE HOW MANY QUILLS WE CAN FIND 
SO WHAT EVER YOU CAN FIND YOU CAN HAVE 
AFTER THREE PILES OF POO I THINK JACK DESERVES 
TO PICK UP SOMETHING NICE 
HOW MANY HAVE YOU FOUND THEN A LOT 
ALMOST A WHOLE PORCUPINE WELL DONE 
WHAT ARE THEY MADE OF 
THEY'RE THEY'RE MADE OF HAIR 
THE SAME AS YOUR HAIR'S MADE OF THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE 
IT'S JUST THAT THEY'RE A LOT LOT STIFFER 
AND SHARPER AND SHARPER 
SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR QUILLS 
CAN YOU TAKE THAT HOME WITH YOU AS WELL NO 
IT LOOKS LIKE JACK'S NOT TAKING ANY MORE SMELLY STUFF FROM MATT 
HE'S OFF TO RATE THE PORCUPINES IN HIS ROAR RANGER DIARY 
AT THE BEGINNING I FELT A BIT NERVOUS OF THE PORCUPINES 
BUT AFTER IT WASN'T AS BAD 
JACK CAME ALONG HE DIDN'T LIKE IT MUCH 
IT WAS A BIT ROUGH A BIT TOO MUCH BUT HE CAME ROUND AND DID THE JOB 
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT MUCH PORCUPINE POO AND IT JUST STUNK 
THE DAY WENT VERY GOOD YEAH BUT A BIT STINKY 
NOW BE PREPARED IF YOU'RE SQUEAMISH 
BECAUSE INSIDE PORT LYMPNE SURGERY 
JANE THE VET IS ABOUT TO OPERATE ON COLLEGIE 
THE CARACAL WITH THE TORN SIDE 
COLLEGIE'S WOUND ISN'T DEEP BUT IT'S OVER FIFTEEN CENTIMETRES LONG 
AND A LOT OF FLESH HAS BEEN EXPOSED 
INITIALLY NEVILLE FOUND SHE HAD A BIG WOUND A FEW DAYS AGO 
SO WE GAVE HER SOME ANTIBIOTICS COS IT WAS QUITE INFECTED 
NEXT WE ANAESTHETISED HER AND STITCHED HER UP 
AND IT WENT WELL BUT WE HAD TO DO LOTS OF CLEANING 
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF FUR IN IT AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
EVER SINCE SHE'S BEEN ON ANTIBIOTICS AND PAINKILLERS 
AND SHE WAS DOING REALLY WELL 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY OVERNIGHT THE WOUND OPENED UP AND THEN 
CATS GROOM ANYTHING THAT FEELS A BIT ODD 
SO SHE'S PROBABLY OPENED IT UP MORE 
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S CAUSED THE INITIAL WOUND 
COLLEGIE HASN'T BEEN ATTACKED BY ANOTHER ANIMAL 
NEVILLE THINKS SHE TORE HERSELF IN HER ENCLOSURE 
BUT WHAT THAT WAS REMAINS A MYSTERY 
IT'S ALWAYS A SURPRISE WHEN YOU FIND A BIG WOUND LIKE THIS 
THE FIRST THING IS TO REALLY TRY AND WORK OUT WHY IT HAPPENED 
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S HAPPENED 
THERE'S THE POTENTIAL IT'LL HAPPEN AGAIN 
WE'VE BEEN ROUND THE ENCLOSURE SEVERAL TIMES 
EVERYBODY'S COME UP WITH THE CONCLUSION 
THERE'S NO APPARENT REASON WHY SHE COULD HAVE DONE IT 
OBVIOUSLY THE WOUND MUST HAVE BEEN VERY PAINFUL 
WHEN SHE FIRST HAD IT 
AS SOON AS WE NOTICED IT AND STITCHED IT UP 
SHE'S BEEN ON PAINKILLERS EVER SINCE 
SO SHE SHOULD NOT BE REALLY FEELING IN ANY DISCOMFORT FROM IT 
BUT OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT PAINKILLERS 
IT WOULD HURT HER VERY MUCH 
BUT ALSO IF IT IS IN PAIN ANIMALS OFTEN ATTACK THEIR OWN WOUND 
IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH BETTER OBVIOUSLY FOR THEM 
AND FOR HEALING TO GIVE THEM PAINKILLERS 
IF SOMETHING HURTS ANIMALS TEND TO CHEW AT IT 
IT'S NOT A VERY SENSIBLE THING TO DO 
BUT THEY ALL CONSISTENTLY SEEM TO DO IT 
NO MAJOR ORGANS HAVE BEEN DAMAGED 
BUT THE INJURY IS LARGE ENOUGH TO BE POTENTIALLY FATAL 
IN THE WILD I THINK ULTIMATELY IT WOULD PROBABLY 
LEAD TO THE CAT DYING 
BUT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO HUNT NORMALLY 
THE WOUND WOULD PROBABLY GET INCREDIBLY INFECTED 
AND I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE A VERY SAD ENDING 
FORTUNATELY FOR THIS CAT 
SHE'S IN THE HUGELY EXPERIENCED CARE OF PORT LYMPNE STAFF 
THIS COULD BE THE LAST STITCH 
THAT'S LOOKING PRETTY NICE 
THE WOUND HAS NEEDED OVER FIFTY STITCHES 
BUT AT LAST THE SURGERY'S FINISHED 
IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT JANE'S ABLE TO GET SO CLOSE 
TO A BEAUTIFUL CARACAL LIKE THIS ONE 
SHE TAKES THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE HER A FULL EXAMINATION 
HERE ARE HER CANINES THEY'RE QUITE BIG 
AND THEN AT THE FRONT SHE'S GOT SOME OF HER LITTLE INCISORS 
JUST LIKE WE HAVE BUT HERS ARE ABSOLUTELY TINY 
AND THEN THESE TEETH HERE THIS ONE AT THE BOTTOM 
AND THIS ONE AT THE TOP ARE CARNASSIALS 
WHEN WE CLOSE THE MOUTH THEY COME TOGETHER LIKE SCISSORS 
SO THEY'RE USED FOR SHEARING AND ALL CATS HAVE THOSE 
THE BIGGER CATS OBVIOUSLY HAVE A HUGE CANACIALS 
HERS ARE STILL QUITE BIG AND THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT TEETH 
FOR A CAT TO HAVE 
NEVILLE'S RELIEVED HE KNOWS AS SERIOUS THIS 
ALL COULD HAVE BEEN FOR COLLEGIE 
WITH HER I THINK SHE'S DOWN TO FIVE LIVES NOW 
SO LET'S HOPE THEY'RE LONG AND HAPPY ONES 
COME ON THEN MISSUS 
IT'S BEEN A TRAUMATIC FEW HOURS 
THE BEST PLACE FOR HER TO RECOVER 
IS IN A QUIET ENCLOSURE AWAY FROM OTHER ANIMALS 
THAT'S WHERE NEVILLE AND RICH ARE GOING TO TAKE HER 
I HOPE SHE'S GOING TO LEAVE THE WOUND ALONE NOW 
AND IT'LL HEAL WELL 
SHE'S ON PAINKILLERS SO IT SHOULDN'T TROUBLE HER 
HOPEFULLY SHE'LL BEHAVE AND GET BACK TO NORMAL 
BACK IN HER NEW ENCLOSURE THE PATIENT IS PUT IN HER 
SLEEPING QUARTERS TO RECOVER 
JUST HAVE A QUICK CHECK ON COLLEGIE 
SHE SEEMS TO BE COMING ROUND NICELY 
SHE'S GOING TO BE SORE FOR A FEW DAYS 
I THINK WE'LL LEAVE HER IN PEACE 
IT LOOKS LIKE COLLEGIE'S GOING TO BE O. K. 
SHE'LL BE SORE FOR A WEEK OR TWO 
BUT BEFORE TOO LONG SHE'LL BE BACK IN HER OWN ENCLOSURE 
LET'S JUST HOPE SHE STAYS OUT OF TROUBLE 
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT HOW WELL THE KEEPERS REALLY KNOW THEIR ANIMALS 
SO WE'VE ASKED THEM 
THE GREEDIEST UM ER 
THE GREEDIEST ANIMAL OOH 
WOULD PROBABLY BE 
OH GOSH UM 
ME 
THE GREEDIEST ANIMAL FOR ME WOULD BE THE GORILLA 
JUST GENERALLY ANY GORILLA 
RED RIVER HOGS I THINK THEY SEEM TO JUST EAT FOREVER 
THEY'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR FOOD 
I THINK THE MONKEYS 
THEY LIKE TO STUFF FOOD IN THEIR POUCHES 
GOT TO BE THE MONKEYS ANY OF THEM 
PROBABLY THE ELEPHANTS 
COS THEY EAT LOADS WILDEBEEST 
NO MATTER WHERE YOU PUT THE FOOD DOWN THEY KNOW IT'S THERE 
THEY COME RUNNING AND PUSH EVERYBODY AWAY SO THEY CAN GET IN 
THE GORILLAS 
TAMBABI TAMBABI THE GORILLA 
A. K. A. MRS. BLOBBY 
PROBABLY THE ELEPHANTS 
THEY LIKE FOOD AND EVERY MORNING WHEN THEIR BREAKFAST 
IS PUT OUT THEY DO GET VERY EXCITED 
THE GREEDIEST ANIMAL WOULD HAVE TO BE ONE OF OUR RHINOS NAKURU 
SHE LIKES HER FOOD THAT'S FOR SURE 
SHE LOVES HER FOOD AND GETS QUITE VIOLENT AT FEED TIMES 
THE GREEDIEST ANIMAL WOULD BE THE GORILLA 
IT WOULD BE ELEPHANTS 
TWO HUNDRED KILOS A DAY 
DEFINITELY EAT MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE 
SO IT'S NECK AND NECK BETWEEN THE GORILLAS AND THE ELEPHANTS 
WITH JUST A FEW KEEPERS STILL TO ASK WHO IS THE MASTER MUNCHER 
THE GREEDIEST ANIMAL PROBABLY IS JUMS HE JUST EATS ALL THE TIME 
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE HERE THAT EATS AS MUCH AS HIM 
JUMS THE BULL ELEPHANT JUMS 
I'D PROBABLY SAY THE ELEPHANTS 
AND THE ANIMALS TO BE CROWNED KING GLUTTONS ARE 
THE ELEPHANTS 
WITH A GOLD STAR GOING TO JUMS THE GREEDIEST OF ALL THE PARK'S ANIMALS 
SO I'D BETTER GET ON AND FEED HIM 
BUT WHAT ON EARTH'S CREATING ALL THAT RACKET 
I'M HERE WITH ELE KEEPER LIZ MORRIS FOR A SPOT OF TOMBOLA 
LIZ WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE TODAY 
WELL WHAT WE'VE DONE TODAY IS 
WE'VE FILLED THESE DRUMS UP HERE WITH SOME JUMBO ROLLS 
WHICH YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR HAND THERE SO WHAT'S IN THESE 
THIS IS AN ELEPHANT DIET IT'S GOT VITAMINS AND MINERALS 
EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED 
IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY TINY FOR AN ELEPHANT 
IT DOES BUT THEY'VE BEEN FED TODAY 
THEY'VE HAD THEIR FRUIT AND VEG AND THEIR HAY 
THIS IS AN EXTRA TREAT FOR THEM 
WE'VE DECIDED TO PUT THEM IN THESE DRUMS AND AS YOU SEE 
THEY HAVE GREAT FUN GETTING THEM OUT 
SO WHO HAVE WE GOT HERE INTRODUCE ME 
THIS IS TAMMY AND HER DAUGHTER JARA 
LITTLE JARA NOW JARA CAN OBVIOUSLY NOT REACH UP THERE 
SO DOES MUM HAVE TO HELP HER OUT 
EVERY SINGLE ELE HAS GOT A DIFFERENT TECHNIQUE WITH THE DRUMS 
YOU SEE WHAT TAMMY WOULD DO IS SHE'D USE HER TRUNK 
WHICH IS EXTREMELY MUSCULAR TO JUST ROCK THE TOMBOLA 
THE DRUM AND ACTUALLY THE JUMBO ROLLS FALL OUT INTO HER TRUNK 
NOW SHE'S MOVED AWAY FOR THIS ELE WHO'S THIS ONE 
THIS IS SHEEBY NOW SHEEBY IS A HIGHER RANKING ELEPHANT 
SO OBVIOUSLY TAMMY WOULD GIVE WAY TO SHEEBY AND SHEEBY'S GOT 
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TECHNIQUE SHE SUCKS THEM OUT 
IT JUST SHOWS HOW POWERFUL THEIR TRUNKS ARE 
SO HOW POWERFUL ARE THEIR TRUNKS 
THEY USE THEM IN THE WILD FOR FOOD EXTREMELY 
THEY'VE GOT THOUSANDS OF MUSCLES IN THERE 
THERE'S NO BONE IT'S JUST PURE MUSCLE PURE MUSCLE 
PURE MUSCLE SO I MEAN 
IT'S FANTASTIC THEY'RE QUITE HEAVY THOSE DRUMS 
THEY'RE SO LOUD THESE DRUMS CAN I JUST SAY 
IT'S NOT SHEEBY IT'S THIS ONE OVER HERE MAKING ALL THE NOISE 
THAT'S JUMS HE'S OUR BULL ELEPHANT 
AND HE GOES TO THE DRUM AND SMACKS IT 
SMACKS IT AND SMACKS IT HAS GREAT FUN AND THE FOOD FLIES EVERYWHERE 
MAYBE YOU SHOULD OIL THE DRUM 
HE'S A BIT LOUD O. I. KEEP IT DOWN 
ARE ELEPHANTS QUITE INTELLIGENT 
LOOKING AROUND TO SEE THESE TOMBOLAS 
YOU WOULDN'T THINK THERE WAS FOOD IN THEM 
I THINK THEY'VE GOT A GOOD SENSE OF SMELL 
THEY KNEW WE WERE DOING SOMETHING THIS MORNING 
COS THEY COULD SMELL THE JUMBO ROLLS 
STRAIGHT AWAY THEY'RE OVER TO THE DRUMS AND 
THEY ARE VERY CLEVER COS EACH OF THEM'S GOT A DIFFERENT TECHNIQUE 
YEAH THEY'VE ALL WORKED OUT HOW TO WORK THEM REALLY 
AND THE BABIES ARE WATCHING LEARNING FROM MUM HOW TO DO IT SO 
WELL IT IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE 
THANK YOU FOR LETTING US COME DOWN 
YOU'RE WELCOME 
HAVE YOU BEEN PLAYING THE ROAR GAME ON THE CBBC WEBSITE 
YES THEN YOU'LL KNOW THAT EVERY DAY ON THE PROGRAMME 
WE GIVE YOU A SECRET CODE TO UNLOCK SPECIAL FEATURES LIKE TREATS 
AND EVEN NEW ANIMALS 
TODAY'S CODE IS ON YOUR SCREEN NOW 
EXPERIENCED GAMERS MAY HAVE 
DISCOVERED THESE TREATS BUT WHETHER YOU'RE NEW TO THE GAME 
OR AN OLD HAND DON'T FORGET TO ALSO CHECK OUT OUR RATE MY PARK FEATURE 
GOOD LUCK AND HAPPY GAMING 
THAT'S ALMOST IT FOR TODAY BUT BEFORE WE GO 
WE'VE JUST ENOUGH TIME TO HEAD TO THE AFRICAN EXPERIENCE 
AND VISIT TWO BEAUTIFUL NEW ARRIVALS 
THE PARK'S FIRST EVER OSTRICH CHICKS 
THEY'VE SURVIVED THREE WEEKS OF BAD WEATHER 
AND ESCAPED THE ATTENTION OF THE LOCAL FOXES 
BOB SAVILLE HAS BROUGHT US UP TO MEET THEM 
YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING THESE HUNGRY PECKERS FED 
AND HOW ARE THEY GETTING ON 
VERY WELL I'M OVER THE MOON WITH HOW THEY'RE DOING 
I MEAN THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE I'M VERY VERY PLEASED 
IT'S QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT 
BECAUSE BREEDING BABY OSTRICHES IN CAPTIVITY 
LIKE THIS IS QUITE DIFFICULT 
THE BREEDING OF THEM IS VERY EASY 
DOING IT NATURALLY IS VERY DIFFICULT 
MOST OSTRICHES LIKE ON OSTRICH FARMS 
THE EGGS ARE TAKEN AWAY AND INCUBATED AND HATCHED OUT THAT WAY 
WE'VE HAD EXACTLY THE RIGHT WEATHER CONDITIONS THIS YEAR 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT 
THAT'S GREAT NEWS 
IS THIS AN IMPORTANT TIME IN THEIR LIFE 
OR ARE THESE GUYS NOW HAPPY TO SURVIVE 
NO OBVIOUSLY THEY'VE LEARNT TO EAT THEY'VE LEARNT TO DRINK 
EVERYTHING'S HEALTHY INSIDE 
BUT NOW FOR ABOUT THE NEXT SIX EIGHT WEEKS IT'S REALLY CRITICAL 
IF THEY GET LOST FROM MUM AND DAD THEY CAN GET WET 
THEN THEY'LL GET COLD AND DIE THAT WAY 
AND OUR LOCAL FOX POPULATION WILL RATHER LOOK FORWARD TO IT 
SO THERE ARE A FEW RISKS FOR THEM 
BUT IT'S KEEPING IT AS NATURAL AS YOU CAN 
YES I MEAN THEY'VE HAD A FEW CLOSE SHAVES OVER THE LAST THREE WEEKS 
I'VE GOT LOTS MORE GREY HAIRS 
BUT THEY'VE SURVIVED THIS LONG SO 
YOU KNOW ALL BEING WELL THEY'LL GO 
FINGERS CROSSED THEY'RE PRETTY TINY AT THE MOMENT 
THEY'VE SOME GROWING TO DO TO CATCH UP WITH MUM AND DAD 
HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE 
I WOULD IMAGINE AT LEAST ANOTHER EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFORE 
THEY'RE NEAR THE ADULT SIZE 
PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER LEAVE THEM TO THEIR FEAST 
WE DON'T WANT TO RUFFLE ANY FEATHERS DO WE BOB 
THAT WAS GOOD THAT WAS GOOD THANKS VERY MUCH BOB 
WE'LL HAVE LOADS MORE ANIMALS FOR YOU ON NEXT TIME'S ROAR 
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE US LOOK AT THIS 
THERE'S NO PLACE TO HIDE 
WE MEET THE TIGERS WHO LOVE CLIMBING TREES 
A LOVE BUG HITS THE ANIMAL PARKS 
AND THESE AMOROUS ANTEATERS SEEM TO HAVE CAUGHT IT 
AND POO WHAT A STINKER 
WE FIND OUT WHY RHINO DUNG HOLDS A SECRET MESSAGE
