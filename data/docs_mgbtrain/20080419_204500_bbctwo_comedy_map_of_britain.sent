THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE 
WELCOME TO A NEW SERIES OF THE COMEDY MAP OF BRITAIN 
I'M ALAN WHICKER AND AS YOUR COMEDY CARTOGRAPHER I'LL BE PRESIDING OVER THE NEXT SIX PROGRAMMES 
AS WE CONTINUE OUR TOUR OF BRITAIN IN THE COMPANY OF SOME FUNNY MEN AND WOMEN 
UNCOVERING PLACES THAT HAVE INSPIRED OUR NATIONAL TREASURE THE BRITISH SENSE OF HUMOUR 
THIS HAS CHANGED A LOT 
WHERE DID IT ALL GO WRONG 
THIS IS WHERE WE CAME WITH PLASTIC DOG TURDS FROM THE JOKE SHOP 
AND PUT IT ON THE STEP AND HE CAME OUT AND HE WENT BLOODY HELL 
I REALLY WAS IMMENSELY WHACKY AND IN MANY WAYS I WAS A PRAT 
THIS A RADIO STUDIO THEY WERE DISCOVERED AT THEIR HOUSE 
IF I DO THAT IT TAKES IT OFF THE AIR WOO HOO HOO THAT'S POWER 
THAT WAS IT THAT'S JONATHAN CREEK 
SO I STOLE YOUR IDENTITY AND MADE A CHARACTER OUT OF IT 
MMM 
WHERE IS LOVE 
DOES IT COME FROM SKIES ABOVE 
TONIGHT WE START OUR JOURNEY IN THE HEART OF ENGLAND 
TRAVELLING FROM THE EAST MIDLANDS TO CAMBRIDGE 
AND TAKING IN UNEXPECTED POINTS OF COMEDY INTEREST ALONG THE WAY 
ALAN CARR RELIVES CHILDHOOD MEMORIES OF HAVING A FOOTBALL MANAGER AS A DAD IN NORTHAMPTON 
COBBLERS NO IT'S TRUE 
THEY WOULD SHOUT OUT HE'S GOT NO HAIR WE DON'T CARE GRAHAM GRAHAM C. A. OOH AAAR 
THAT WAS LOVELY THAT'S MY DAD I'D BE THERE GOING YEAH 
DAVID BADDIEL REMEMBERS THE TEENAGE TRAUMA OF SCHOOL SWIMMING LESSONS WITHOUT TRUNKS 
I IMAGINE I WAS OFTEN IN THERE NAKED WITH MY TINY COCK YES 
AND THE CREATORS OF SPITTING IMAGE CATCH UP WITH AN OLD FRIEND 
THERE'S LOTS I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THOSE TWO BASTARDS 
OUR JOURNEY BEGINS IN THE STATELY WARWICKSHIRE HOME TOWN OF THE BARD HIMSELF 
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 
IT WAS IN STRATFORD UPON AVON THAT ONE BRASH LITTLE AMERICAN COMEDIENNE 
STARTED HER CAREER IN A RATHER UNLIKELY FASHION 
IT WAS WITH THE ROYAL SHAKESPEARE COMPANY 
THAT RUBY WAX FIRST ACTED UP AS A CLASSICAL ACTRESS 
WAS THIS WHERE THE STAGE DOOR WAS IT WAS HERE 
I'VE DREAMT ABOUT THIS EVERY NIGHT SINCE I WAS HERE AT THE ROYAL SHAKESPEARE COMPANY 
I ONLY BECAME A COMEDIAN BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE A CLASSICAL ACTRESS 
AND THEN WHEN I GOT ON STAGE NEXT TO JUDI DENCH AND IAN MCKELLEN I SUDDENLY REALISED I WAS AWFUL 
AND THEN ALAN RICKMAN SAID MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO INTO COMEDY 
SO THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED THIS IS SO BIZARRE 
OH GOD O. K. 
IS THIS WHERE IT WAS I THOUGHT IT WAS SO MUCH MORE GLAMOROUS 
EUCH IT'S A DUMP 
OH YEAH THIS IS THE THEATRE 
OH MY GOD YEAH 
HOW DO YOU GET TO THE STAGE 
OH WELL THIS IS A BRICK WALL 
WE CAN'T 
THEY'VE TORN DOWN THE THEATRE WHERE I USED TO WORK IT'S REALLY UPSETTING 
I WISH YOU COULD SEE IT IT LOOKED LIKE EVERY OTHER THEATRE 
GO TO THE BARBICAN IT'S THE SAME IDEA JUST CUT IN THE BARBICAN THEY WON'T KNOW 
AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER THIS IS WHERE RUBY LIVED IN ONE OF THESE ROOMS IN THIS HOUSE 
IT WAS AN AWFULLY LONG TIME AGO AND WE WERE PROBABLY A BIT DRUNK 
NEXT DOOR TO THE PUB THE RIVER'S HERE 
THE THEATRE'S THERE AND RUBY LIVED HERE 
THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH FROM WHEN RUBY AND I FIRST STARTED WORKING TOGETHER 
RUBY'S CONCENTRATING ON HER SHAKESPEAREAN ROLE RATHER THAN COMEDY 
AND WE'RE BOTH INTENTLY LISTENING TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN REHEARSAL 
I WAS A HIDEOUS CHILD 
MY FRONT TEETH WERE IN ANOTHER TIME ZONE 
THEY WERE ABOUT TWO HOURS IN FRONT OF MY FACE 
WE WERE IN A DRESSING ROOM TOGETHER FOR A YEAR 
THERE WAS RUBY JULIET STEVENSON AND MYSELF UP THERE 
O. K. I KNOW THE WAY 
SHARING A DRESSING ROOM 
IS LIKE BEING IN A PRISON CELL TOGETHER IT'S QUITE BONDING 
IT SMELLS LIKE UNDERPANTS 
AND CABBAGE THAT'S BACKSTAGE 
I MEAN RUBY IS A COMIC FORCE OF NATURE 
SHE MADE LIFE SEEM KIND OF HEIGHTENED 
THIS WAS MY DRESSING ROOM 
WOW 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I SAT DO YOU REMEMBER DARLING 
WHERE DID I SIT I WAS A WENCH 
AND I'D PRACTISE MY ENGLISH ACCENT OVER AND OVER HERE 
TA TA TA TA MY TONGUE WAS MAGNIFICENT BUT I STILL COULDN'T GET AN ENGLISH ACCENT 
I COULD DO GREAT THINGS WITH MY TONGUE 
RUBY AND I FOUND OURSELVES PLAYING WHAT WAS CALLED A PLAY AS CAST CONTRACT ROLES 
WHICH IS SORT OF SHUT UP AND DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD AND LIVE ON SIXTY A WEEK 
THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE PILE REALLY AND I GOT 
NO COINS SIR YOU MUSTN'T SHAFT ME OI'M JUST A SIMPLE BUXOM WENCH O. I. AM 
IT WAS LIKE EARLY PORNO YOU'D SEE FAMOUS PEOPLE ON STAGE GOING LIKE THIS 
OH LIKE THAT OH 
IT WAS AWFUL NOT TO MENTION THE AUDIENCE GOING 
I DON'T KNOW IS THERE SOMEBODY FROM CHICAGO IN LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST 
AND I THOUGHT I DID A REALLY MEAN ACCENT 
WE WERE IN A PRODUCTION OF THE TEMPEST 
AND OUR FIRST JOB WAS TO BE WATER NYMPHS 
I CALLED THE DANCE OF THE NAIADS THE DANCE OF THE BAR MITZVAH WOMEN 
WE DRESSED AS WOMEN WHO HAD GONE TO A BAR MITZVAH BUT HAD LOST THEIR MINDS ON AMPHETAMINES 
AND THE WATER NYMPHS OR NAIADS COME OUT OF THE RIVER 
AND THEY SORT OF DO THIS AMAZING DANCE AND FLOW AROUND THE MAIN ACTORS 
THIS KIND OF HUGE BIG BUT KIND OF 
WHORE DANCING LIKE OF NAIADS 
AND THEN DISAPPEAR BACK MAGICALLY INTO THE MISTY HORIZON 
WELL IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS WE WERE BROUGHT UP ON A LIFT 
FROM RIGHT DOWN IN THE BOWELS OF THE STAGE YOU KNOW 
AS THE IMITATES LIFT MACHINERY 
WE WERE SURE YOU COULD HEAR IT I'D GO FIRST FLOOR LINGERIE SECOND FLOOR LADIES' UNMENTIONABLES 
THIRD FLOOR HOME APPLIANCES AND THEN WE'D GET TO THE FLOOR 
AND JULIET IS AN EASY PUSH SO SHE WAS ALREADY HYSTERICAL 
AND THEN SHE'D JUST BE FULLY EXPOSED ON STAGE AND YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE JUST HONKING 
I WAS JUST HELPLESS HELPLESS 
I HAD NO MUSCLE CONTROL LEFT AT ALL 
SHE ACTUALLY CAME UP ON THE ELEVATOR ONE NIGHT AND URINATED DID SHE TELL YOU THIS 
THIS PEE POURED DOWN MY LEGS ONTO THE STAGE 
AND I WAS ONLY A FEW MONTHS OUT OF DRAMA SCHOOL THIS WAS MY BIG BREAK 
AND THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENED IS TWO PEOPLE HAD TO COME OUT DRESSED AS SHIPMATES 
BECAUSE IT TOOK PLACE ON THE SEA AND THEY HAD TO WIPE OFF HER URINE 
OTHERWISE ALAN RICKMAN WOULD HAVE SKIDDED ON IT IN THE NEXT SCENE 
WE WERE VERY SABOTAGED BY RUBY'S HUMOUR IN OUR ATTEMPTS TO BE MAGICAL 
YOU GO UNDER THE STAGE WHERE THE ELEVATOR IS 
OH 
YEAH YOU HAVE TO GO WAY WAY DOWN 
WOULD THIS BE IT HERE'S THE ELEVATOR 
HERE'S THE ELEVATOR 
YES YES YES THERE'S THE ELEVATOR THERE'S WHERE WE'D HAVE TO COME DOWN HERE CLIMB UP THOSE STAIRS 
GET ON THE ELEVATOR AND THEN I'D START TO GO 
ON FIRST FLOOR LADIES' UNMENTIONABLES AND JULIET WOULD BE PEEING 
LET'S GO UP AND SEE YOU'LL STICK YOUR HEAD THROUGH 
AND THEN WE'LL BE ON THE STAGE GO ON 
OH NO THIS IS THE WRONG STAGE 
IS THIS THE WIG ROOM 
OH YEAH 
COS THAT'S WHERE YOUR WIGS WERE THE BAR MITZVAH WOMEN WIGS 
ANYWAY SO RICKMAN SAID YOU'RE NOT A GOOD ACTRESS IT ISN'T YOUR IMAGINATION 
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE GO THAT'S JUST IN YOUR MIND 
HE SAID IT'S REALLY TRUE I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING THIS BAD EVERYBODY'S DISGUSTED 
AND SO HE SAID YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE A WRITER 
SO I CLUTCHED ONTO THAT BUT I KNEW I WASN'T GOING TO BE SERIOUS 
SO HE SAID YOU COULD BE A COMEDY WRITER JUST WRITE THE WAY YOU TALK 
FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE JAZZ MUSICIANS RATHER THAN CLASSICAL PIANISTS 
JUST WRITING JAZZ AND SO SENTENCES WOULD RUN ON IT WAS RAW 
IN ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS TOO WHERE IT DIDN'T SOUND SO BEAUTIFUL BUT IT SOUNDED DIFFERENT 
IT'S A NEW RHYTHM OF SPEAKING 
YOU AIN'T CLUNKING DOWN MY CATWALK NO WAY BABE 
CALVIN KLEIN AIN'T PAYING YOU TO SQUASH YOUR TUSH INTO HIS MINI PANTS 
FAT BUTT HUH THE PLANET JUPITER AND ITS MOONS 
A GALAXY OF EXCESS FLUBBER 
BESIDES GREAT BEAUTY A FUNNY LINE CAN GET MEN'S PANTS DOWN REAL FAST 
AND I LEARNED THAT LESSON AND SO I SAID RUBY JUST KEEP WRITING 
BEFORE WE TO QUOTE SHAKESPEARE'S THE WINTER'S TALE EXIT LEFT PURSUED BY BEAR 
WE LOOK FOR INSPIRATION TO THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE MAN HIMSELF 
THE FATHER OF ALL COMEDY SCRIBBLERS 
THIS IS THE ROOM WHERE OUR GREATEST COMIC WRITER WAS BORN 
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE BORN OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
BUT HIS PLAYS STILL KEEP PEOPLE LAUGHING TODAY 
SHAKESPEARE WAS WRITING FOR A VERY INTERACTIVE KIND OF THEATRE 
IF THE JOKES FELL FLAT 
THE ACTORS WOULD GET A NUT 
OR A ROTTEN TOMATO ON THEIR FACE FROM THE AUDIENCE 
THERE WAS A CONSTANT SENSE OF THE DANGER OF LIVE THEATRE 
IT WAS JUST LIKE STAND UP COMEDY TODAY 
OH THEN BUT LIKE SHE WAS OLD AND GENTLE 
YOU HAVE GOOD JUDGEMENT IN WHORESMANSHIP 
IN THE END COMEDY DEPENDS ON HALF A DOZEN BASIC SITUATIONS 
CHARACTER TYPES OR SITUATIONS OF CHARACTERS ENCOUNTERING EACH OTHER 
AND SHAKESPEARE REALLY LAID THE GROUND FOR THOSE COMIC ARCHETYPES 
IN PRETTY WELL ANY MODERN COMEDY I COULD FIND FOR YOU 
A PRECEDENT IN SHAKESPEARE WHERE HE HAD GOT THERE FIRST 
GIVE ME A COMIC CHARACTER FROM TODAY 
AND LET'S SEE IF WE CAN HAVE A SHAKESPEAREAN PARALLEL 
DAD'S ARMY HOW ABOUT MR. MAINWARING 
THE SHAKESPEAREAN EQUIVALENT OF THAT IS IN HENRY THE FOURTH PART TWO 
THERE'S A SCENE WHERE FALSTAFF HAS TO RECRUIT A BUNCH OF SOLDIERS 
THERE'S A KIND OF OLD AND FRAIL ONE WHO'S CLEARLY GOING TO BE NO GOOD AS A SOLDIER 
THERE'S A YOUNG STUPID ONE LIKE PRIVATE PIKE 
HERE SIR 
WHAT TRADE ARE THOU A WOMAN'S TAILOR SIR 
AND THEN THERE'S A BIT OF A SPIVVY ONE AND IT'S JUST LIKE DAD'S ARMY 
THE SENSE OF THESE UNLIKELY CHARACTERS BEING PUT TOGETHER 
RIGHT ATTENTION PULL UP ARMS 
HUP TWO THREE FOUR TWO THREE 
BACK TWO THREE BUTT 
SORRY SIR WHAT WAS THAT YOU SAID 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR CLASSIC THING IN SHAKESPEAREAN COMEDY OF THE FOOL AND THE STRAIGHT MAN 
WHICH IS JUST LIKE MORECAMBE AND WISE OR ANY KIND OF DOUBLE ACT 
WHAT'S YOUR FIRST NAME ERN ERN 
ERN 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS IN GREEK NO 
POT 
IN HAMLET THERE'S THAT SCENE WITH THOSE GRAVE DIGGERS JUST HAVING ENDLESS DEBATES ABOUT NOTHING 
WHAT IS HE THAT BUILDS STRONGER THAN EITHER THE MASON THE SHIPWRIGHT 
OR THE CARPENTER 
THE GALLOWS MAKER FOR THAT FRAME OUTLIVES A THOUSAND TENANTS 
THAT ALWAYS REMINDS ME OF PETER COOK AND DUDLEY MOORE 
HERE YOU ARE HAVE A SANDWICH MY FEET ARE KILLING ME 
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH A SANDWICH 
NOTHING I JUST SAID IT AFTERWARDS YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT 
IT'S COULD CONFUSE A STUPID PERSON 
IN THE END IT'S THE SITUATIONS NOT THE ONE LINERS THAT ARE FUNNIEST IN SHAKESPEARE 
SHAKESPEARE WORKED THEM ALL HE COVERED ALL THE BASES 
YEAH ARE YOU CONVINCED BY THIS 
YES 
LIKE THE M. FORTY TWO WE SKIRT BIRMINGHAM 
AND HEAD FOR THE EAST MIDLANDS CITY OF NOTTINGHAM 
HOME TO ROBIN HOOD TORVILL AND DEAN AND RADIO TRENT 
WHICH GAVE A NOTICEABLY PALER DALE WINTON HIS FIRST BREAK 
NOTTINGHAM'S ALSO HOME TO THE JUST THE TONIC COMEDY CLUB 
A VENUE THAT GAVE ONE CELEBRATED COMEDIAN HIS START IN STAND UP 
THIS PLACE HAS CHANGED 
THIS PLACE USED TO BE CALLED THE OLD VIC AND IT USED TO BE 
THE HOME OF MY COMEDY CLUB JUST THE TONIC IN NOTTINGHAM 
GREAT CLUB SOME BIG AND SOME LESSER NAME COMEDIANS ON 
SOME TRYING OUT THEIR FIRST TIME DOING STAND UP 
AND ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WAS A BLOKE YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF RICKY GERVAIS 
I WAS COMPERING AT A CLUB IN LONDON CALLED THE GUILTY PEA 
IN THE AUDIENCE WAS RICKY GERVAIS THE BLOKE OFF THE ELEVEN O'CLOCK SHOW 
WE WENT FOR A DRINK AND HE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WAS SEEN AS A COMEDIAN 
BUT FELT HE HADN'T PAID HIS DUES AS HE'D NEVER DONE STAND UP 
THE FINGERPRINTS OF THE KOALA ARE SO SIMILAR TO HUMAN PRINTS 
THEY COULD BE CONFUSED AT THE SCENE OF A CRIME 
WHAT CRIME WOULD THAT BE THEN 
THE GREAT FUCKING EUCALYPTUS ROBBERY 
I SAID WHY DON'T YOU COME AND PLAY MY CLUB IN NOTTINGHAM I WON'T TELL ANYONE NO PRESSURE 
COME UP AND DO A GIG SO HE CAME UP WITH ONE OF HIS MATES AND OF COURSE I TOLD EVERYONE 
IT WAS FULL AND HE DID TEN MINUTES AND HE WAS VERY FUNNY 
THAT'S ALL I REMEMBER REALLY HE WAS VERY FUNNY 
YOU DON'T NEED TO SPEAK FRENCH IF YOU'RE ENGLISH YOU DON'T NEED TO YOU DON'T 
IF YOU GO TO FRANCE POINT TALK A BIT LOUDER 
IF HE STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
SMASH THE PLACE UP 
SECURE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU TRIED YOUR BEST 
HE WASN'T GOING UP ON STAGE WINGING IT HE DEFINITELY HAD SCRIPTED STUFF 
AND I THINK I'VE GOT A MEMORY OF HIM HAVING STUFF ON HIS HAND 
AND CHECKING IT WHICH IS A NORMAL WHEN YOU'RE STARTING 
COS YOU'VE GOT LOADS TO COPE WITH 
HE WAS A BLOKE REMEMBERING HIS MATERIAL THE FIRST TIME HE'D BEEN IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE 
AND HE HAD THE PRESSURE THAT PEOPLE KNEW WHO HE WAS 
AND HE WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING LIKE POLAR BEARS THEY'RE FUNNY FOR SOME REASON 
HE'D HAVE TAKEN THE PISS OUT OF THE AUDIENCE 
I REALLY CAN'T REMEMBER I REALLY CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT IT 
I'VE TRIED I'VE ASKED PEOPLE NO ONE REMEMBERS 
HOW USELESS 
IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THE ORIGINAL BECKS GREW UP IN A HAPPY FAMILY HOME IN THE NOTTINGHAM SUBURB OF BEESTON 
HE WENT ON TO CHARM THE NATION IN CLASSIC COMEDIES LIKE RISING DAMP 
AND PORRIDGE AND IT WAS IN THIS HOUSE THAT YOUNG RICHARD BECKINSALE FIRST ENJOYED TAKING CENTRE STAGE 
KEEP YOUR NOSE CLEAN BIDE YOUR TIME DO YOUR PORRIDGE ALL RIGHT 
I'M ONLY HERE DUE TO TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES OH WHICH WERE 
I GOT CAUGHT 
WELL HERE WE ARE AT WOODLAND GROVE 
AND THIS WAS OUR FAMILY HOME WHERE WE GREW UP WITH RICHARD 
OH GOSH THIS HAS CHANGED 
I HAVEN'T BEEN BACK HERE FOR OH IT'S GOT TO BE MORE THAN FORTY YEARS 
DOWN AT THE BOTTOM THAT'S WHERE HE USED TO HAVE HIS SKIFFLE GROUP 
HE USED TO REHEARSE DOWN THERE FOR HIS FIRST PERFORMANCES 
DAD MADE RICHARD A TEA CHEST PLINKA PLONKA THING 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED 
HE MADE HIM ONE OF THOSE 
HE HAD A SKIFFLE GROUP WE WERE TEN 
I'VE GOT NO MUSICAL TALENT BUT HE BLAGGED ME INTO PLAYING 
A BISCUIT TIN WITH PAPER ON IT AS A DRUM 
RICK HAD A PLASTIC UKELELE SO THAT WAS HIS FIRST PERFORMANCE 
LATER ON THIS WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST PLACE THAT HE PUBLICLY ENTERTAINED 
IT'S VERY VERY DIFFERENT THIS WAS BACK IN THE SIXTIES 
BUT IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY IT WAS ABOVE THIS ROOM HERE 
I PREFER A SINGLE CELL BECAUSE I WANT TO STUDY 
STUDY YEAH I'VE HAD AN EDUCATION I'VE GOT AN O. LEVEL IN GEOGRAPHY 
HAVE YER OOH THAT'LL COME IN HANDY WON'T IT 
IF THERE'S AN ESCAPE PARTY YOU'RE BOUND TO BE ON IT COS YOU'LL KNOW THE WAY TO CARLISLE STATION 
SO THIS IS IT 
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I DIDN'T KNOW RICHARD AS A SCHOOLBOY 
BUT HE DID TELL ME A FAIR BIT ABOUT SCHOOL 
AND IT WASN'T HIS FAVOURITE PLACE BY ANY MEANS 
I'VE ACTUALLY GOT HIS FULL SCHOOL REPORT HERE 
WE'VE GOT HERE MUSIC 
A GENERAL NUISANCE 
HE'S NOT LEARNT THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE ALL THE PLEASANT THINGS 
LEAVE ALONE THE UNPLEASANT AND STILL HAVE SUCCESS WELL 
HE MANAGED THAT FOR A CERTAIN WHILE ANYWAY 
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE ENTRIES HERE IS 
RICHARD HAS WORKED A LITTLE HARDER THIS TERM BUT HE WILL NOT GIVE HIS BEST 
UNTIL HE REALISES THAT HIS WORK IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN AMUSING OTHERS 
AND HIS FATHER HAS PUT THE AMUSING TRAIT IS VERY STRONG 
BUT I HOPE AND THINK THAT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS 
CONTACT WITH REALITIES WILL PRODUCE A MORE SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC RESULT 
AT THE MOMENT IT IS SUFFICIENT THAT HE IS HAPPY 
PUTTING ON THE AGONY PUTTING ON THE STYLE 
WOW 
IT DOES FEEL THE SAME THOUGH IT'S GOT LIKE THE SAME FEELING 
THIS ONE WAS MY BEDROOM 
THIS WAS MUM AND DAD'S BEDROOM 
HE USED TO SHOUT ME IN AND I USED TO HAVE TO PUT 
ROLLERS AND CURLERS IN HIS HAIR 
TO TRY AND GET HIM A KINK AT THE FRONT BECAUSE HIS HAIR WAS SO STRAIGHT 
AND HE HAD TO HAVE IT WITH A KINK IN FOR HIS SKIFFLE GROUP 
YOUNGER THAN SPRINGTIME ARE YOU 
GAYER THAN LAUGHTER 
FROM THE AGE OF TEN HE WANTED TO BE AN ENTERTAINER 
I THINK IT WAS MORE IN THE LINE OF IT'S A KIND OF BIG CLUB 
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE NICE HOUSES AND CARS AND I WANT TO BE A MEMBER AT THAT POINT 
I WAS CONVINCED HE WAS GOING TO BE FAMOUS HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE FAMOUS 
ONCE WHEN WE WENT DOWN TO STAY WITH MY SISTER IN LONDON IT'S PROBABLY STILL THERE 
UNDER THE WALLPAPER HE WROTE RICHARD BECKINSALE WILL BE FAMOUS AND HE SLEPT HERE 
WHAT'S BROWN LIVES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AND ATTACKS YOUNG MERMAIDS 
I'VE NO IDEA GODBER 
JACK THE KIPPER 
HE WAS ASKED WHEN HE WAS SORT OF FLAVOUR OF THE MONTH IF HE'D CUT A RECORD 
FOUR O. CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
AND I'M HERE WAITING FOR YOU 
BEING A POP STAR PROBABLY WOULD HAVE APPEALED TO HIM 
HE WOULD HAVE ENJOYED THAT SORT OF LIFESTYLE I THINK 
I THINK HE'D HAVE ENJOYED IT 
AIN'T IT STRANGE 
AIN'T IT STRANGE 
WHAT SOME PEOPLE WILL DO 
HE WAS A REALLY GOOD MATE 
AND LOSING HIM STILL HURTS 
COS I MEAN HE'D GOT SO MUCH 
THAT HE COULD HAVE DONE AND HE'D GOT SO MANY IDEAS 
HE WAS BUZZING AND HE WOULD HAVE GONE OFF AND DONE SO MANY THINGS 
AND IT'S GONE 
THE FACE IN THE MIRROR 
BUT YOU'RE NOT THERE TO SEE 
AIN'T IT STRANGE 
AIN'T IT STRANGE 
THERE'S SAD THINGS 
BUT EQUALLY I THINK SOMETIMES WE'RE QUITE LUCKY 
BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE'S STILL THERE 
BUT TO TURN THE TELEVISION ON NOW NEARLY THIRTY YEARS LATER 
I MEAN LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO'D LOST CHILDREN OR BROTHERS WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT WOULDN'T THEY 
WHAT SOME PEOPLE WILL DO 
OUR JOURNEY NOW TAKES US DOWN THE M. ONE TO THE SUBURBS OF LEICESTER 
THE CITY THAT HOUSES THE LARGEST DINOSAUR IN EUROPE 
AND IS BIRTHPLACE TO THE ELEPHANT MAN TO ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK 
AND TO ONE ADRIAN MOLE AGED THIRTEEN AND THREE QUARTERS 
YOUNG MASTER MOLE WAS THE LITERARY CREATION OF SUE TOWNSEND 
A SINGLE MUM WHO WROTE IN SECRET WHILST STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET IN A SEMI ON THIS HOUSING ESTATE 
I'M PROFOUNDLY IN LOVE WITH PANDORA 
THIS HOUSE IS THE HOUSE WHERE SUE TOWNSEND USED TO LIVE AND IT'S ALSO WHERE ADRIAN MOLE WAS BORN 
WITH WHICH I ADORE HER 
GOT ALL BOUNCY IN MY DREAMS 
WHEN SHE LIVED HERE 
SUE'S CIRCUMSTANCES WERE PRETTY GRIM 
SHE WAS A SINGLE MOTHER WITH THREE CHILDREN SHE HAD NOT BEEN DISCOVERED AS A WRITER IN ANY WAY 
SHE WAS STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET AS A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE AT THAT TIME 
ADRIAN DON'T LURK ABOUT LIKE THAT 
WHAT DO YOU WANT I JUST WONDERED WHERE THE CHILD BENEFIT GOES 
I SQUANDER IT ON GIN AND CIGARETTES BY RIGHTS IT SHOULD BE MINE 
I THINK SHE WROTE BECAUSE SHE HAD TO 
SHE JUST NEEDED A FORM OF EXPRESSION FOR HER IDEAS AND HER FEELINGS 
AND THE EASIEST AND THE CHEAPEST REALLY A PENCIL AND A PIECE OF PAPER WAS JUST TO WRITE THINGS DOWN 
THIS IS SOME OF SUE'S EARLY WRITING 
AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT THERE'S LITTLE DRAWINGS BY SUE'S CHILDREN 
IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE SORT OF A MUNDANE PROSAIC LIFE THAT IS IN HERE THAT'S ILLUSTRATED IN HERE 
JUST SOMETHING SIMPLE LIKE A WASHING UP LIST 
AND YET AT THE SAME TIME SHE'S ALSO WRITING QUITE LITERARY PIECES 
AND ACTUALLY USING THIS TO GET HER THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS DOWN ON PAPER 
AND I THINK THAT'S LOVELY 
NOW COME HERE LET ME SQUEEZE THAT SPOT FOR YOU 
SHE TOLD ME SHE USED TO STAND AT THE SINK DOING THE DISHES 
AND JUST WRITE DOWN ODD PHRASES AND IDEAS 
AND THIS IS WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT HUH IT'S AMAZING REALLY 
WE USED TO HAVE A NEW WRITERS' FESTIVAL EVERY YEAR I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO PLAY ADRIAN MOLE 
THURSDAY JANUARY FIRST 
SPOTS ON MY CHIN FOR THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEW YEAR 
THESE ARE MY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS 
I WILL HELP THE BLIND ACROSS THE ROAD 
I WILL PUT THE SLEEVES BACK ON MY RECORDS 
AFTER HEARING THE DISGUSTING NOISES FROM DOWNSTAIRS LAST NIGHT 
I HAVE ALSO VOWED NEVER TO DRINK ALCOHOL 
THE AUDIENCE JUST IMMEDIATELY STARTED LAUGHING AND CARRIED ON LAUGHING THROUGH THE NEXT PAGES 
I MEASURED MY THING IT WAS ELEVEN CENTIMETRES' 
I THINK ADRIAN MOLE IS ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS 
I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN QUITE ENDURING 
AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT WAS SO SUCCESSFUL 
AND SOLD MILLIONS OF BOOKS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
ELEVEN CENTIMETRES 
WHAT'S THAT IN INCHES 
HEADING EASTWARDS FROM THE COSMOPOLITAN METROPOLIS OF LEICESTER 
WE HAPPEN UPON RUTLAND WATER 
THIS ENORMOUS RESERVOIR COVERS MOST OF WHAT WAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR ENGLAND'S SMALLEST COUNTY 
RUTLAND HAD NO LANDMARKS OR MAJOR TOWNS 
BUT IT DID HAVE ITS OWN CULT T. V. SERIES 
B. B. C. TWO OPTS OUT AND RUTLAND WEEKEND TELEVISION OPTS IN 
BRITAIN'S SMALLEST 
TELEVISION NETWORK 
GOES NATIONWIDE 
HELLO TONIGHT AH SORRY 
WHAT DO WE DO NOW SEARCH ME O. K. 
TONIGHT RUTLAND WHITEND 
OH DEAR NEXT 
WELL WE'VE COME BACK TO RUTLAND WATER 
THIRTY YEARS AFTER RUTLAND WEEKEND TELEVISION 
TO VIRTUALLY THE EXACT SPOT WHERE THE TELEVISION STUDIOS WERE 
UNFORTUNATELY AFTER THE LAST SERIES SOMEONE LEFT A TAP ON 
GOOD EVENING 
KEITH YOU HAVE THE REPUTATION OF BEING SOMETHING OF A WIT YES 
PEOPLE SAY THAT AS A NATURAL TALKER YOU ARE REMARKABLY WITTY AND EXTREMELY FUNNY 
YES 
WELL YOU KNOW THIRTY YEARS AGO TELEVISION WAS PRETTY APPALLING 
AND IT SEEMED TO US THAT IT COULD DO WITH A BIT OF SENDING UP 
LOOK OUT OVER THERE WHAT IS IT 
A COMMERCIAL BREAK AVOID IT 
BRAKES SQUEAL 
NEXT WEEK WE'LL BE LOOKING AT SEX IN THE THEATRE 
AND WONDERING WHETHER THE AUDIENCE SHOULDN'T WAIT UNTIL THEY GET HOME 
THE IDEA WAS IT WAS THE SMALLEST TELEVISION STATION IN BRITAIN BECAUSE IT WAS THE SMALLEST COUNTY 
THEREFORE IT HAD THE SMALLEST BUDGETS 
YOU CHEEKY MONKEY 
IT WAS A LICENCE TO MAKE CHEAP TELEVISION 
FILMED EXPENSIVELY ON LOCATION IN RUTLAND YOU CAN SEE THE MIGHT 
AND MAJESTY AND LENGTH OF THE FRENCH ARMY AS IT ADVANCES ON MOSCOW 
SEE MOSCOW IN FLAMES 
WE WERE PROBABLY SPENDING MORE MONEY 
ON RUTLAND WEEKEND TELEVISION THAN THEY PROBABLY SPEND ON SHOWS LIKE THIS 
NOT LIKE THIS ONE OF COURSE THIS HAS HAD LOTS OF RESOURCES AND TIME PUT INTO IT 
WE WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGISE FOR THE OVER MANNING ON THIS PROGRAMME 
WHICH IS DUE TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR IN THE BOOKINGS DEPARTMENT 
ERIC HAD JUST SEPARATED WITH HIS WIFE SO HE HAD A SLIGHTLY SKEWED VIEW OF LOVE 
YOU HAVE TO PUT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN LOVE IN HOSPITAL BECAUSE THEY'RE SICK 
OTHERWISE OTHER PEOPLE WILL CATCH IT 
NASTY FILTHY LITTLE DISEASE 
AND SOME OF THESE DIDN'T COME OFF AS REALLY FUNNY 
THEY MAY BE TRUE BUT NOT REALLY FUNNY 
BUT SOME OF IT I THINK IS PURE WONDER 
THIS MAN IS SUFFERING FROM LOVE SONGS 
IT'S INCURABLE BUT WORTH A FORTUNE 
I FEEL GOOD 
I FEEL BAD 
PROBABLY RUTLAND WEEKEND TELEVISION IS MOST FAMOUS 
FOR KICKING OFF THE RUTLES 
WE WERE THE PREFAB FOUR YES A LEGEND IN THEIR OWN LUNCHTIME 
THEIR FIRST ALBUM WAS MADE IN TWENTY MINUTES 
THE SECOND TOOK EVEN LONGER 
I HAD THE IDEA OF SPOOFING A HARD DAY'S NIGHT 
AND THEN OF COURSE ERIC SAID WE WON'T CALL THEM THE BEATLES WE'LL CALL THEM THE RUTLES 
I SAID YOU CAN'T CALL THEM THE RUTLES THERE'S ONE T. WE'LL BE ROOTLES 
I SUGGESTED WE CALL THEM THE BOOTLES BECAUSE IT'D BE PART OF LIVERPOOL BUT NO 
ERIC WAS ADAMANT AND SO THE RUTLES IT BECAME AND TO THIS DAY PEOPLE STILL PRONOUNCE IT ROOTLE 
YES I REMEMBER IT YEAH 
I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO 
WE DID A BIT OF FILMING IN THE DENHAM VILLAGE HALL GOT UP ON THE STAGE AND MIMED TO THE SOUND TRACK 
AND THEN WE GOT OUT IN THE FIELD AND JUST RAN AROUND THINKING UP IDEAS AS WE WENT ALONG 
I DON'T THINK THAT ANYTHING WAS VERY PRE CONCEIVED JUST HAVING A LAUGH 
O. O. O. O. OH THE MAILBAG WAS ENORMOUS 
STACKS OF MAIL ALL ABOUT THE RUTLES AND BEATLES' ALBUMS WITH BEATLES CROSSED OUT AND RUTLES WRITTEN IN 
BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT THERE ARE BOOTLEG RUTLES 
IF YOU LOOK ON YOUTUBE THERE'S A BAND IN AMERICA 
ANOTHER BOOTLEG RUTLES AND THERE ARE PEOPLE BOOTLEGGING RUTLES ALL OVER THE PLACE 
I FEEL GOOD 
I FEEL BAD 
I FEEL HAPPY 
I FEEL GLAD 
AM I IN LOVE 
A A A H. 
I MUST BE IN LOVE 
CONTINUING SOUTH ON OUR COMEDY QUEST 
DOC MARTEN'S BOOTS WERE BORN HERE AND THE NORTHAMPTON TOWN FOOTBALL CLUB IS NICKNAMED THE COBBLERS 
IT WAS ON THIS OLD GROUND NOW HOME TO THE COUNTY CRICKET CLUB 
THAT ONE YOUNG BOY RELUCTANTLY FOLLOWED HIS FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS 
DELICATELY 
GOD IT'S STRANGE BEING BACK HERE 
IN THE OLD FOOTBALL GROUND IN NORTHAMPTON 
CONSIDERING THE TWO THINGS I HATE MOST ARE NORTHAMPTON AND FOOTBALL 
THIS USED TO BE ALL LIKE MAROON CORRUGATED IRON 
LIKE A PORTALOO BASICALLY 
AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PITCH 
BUT THIS ACTUALLY WAS WHERE THE PEOPLE USED TO STAND ON THE TERRACES 
I FEEL A BIT LIKE TIME TEAM IF WE DUG DOWN THERE'D PROBABLY BE LIKE AN OLD PASTIE OR 
OR A MEAT PIE 
OR THOSE CLACKER THINGS YEAH BUT THIS IS BRINGINGIT ALL BACK 
I SPENT MOST OF MY CHILDHOOD HERE BECAUSE OF MY DAD'S JOB AND IT WAS A REAL ALBATROSS AROUND MY NECK 
ME FATHER WAS A PROFESSIONAL HIS BROTHER WAS A PROFESSIONAL 
MY FATHER'S SISTER MARRIED A TOP PROFESSIONAL 
ALAN WAS NEVER GOING TO BE A FOOTBALLER AND HE WAS REALLY REALLY POOR HE HADN'T A CLUE 
ABSOLUTE DISASTER 
ALL MY COUSINS OF COURSE WERE LIKE GETTING TRIALS AT AROUND SIXTEEN AND FIFTEEN 
YOU KNOW AND THEN THE AUNTS AND UNCLES WOULD SAY IS ALAN TRIALLING 
IS HE PLAYING FOR A TEAM YET 
THEY'D GO IS THAT HIM SKIPPING AND THEY'RE LIKE YEAH THAT'S ALAN 
YOU SEE I HAD A PUSHY DAD YOU KNOW 
HE WANTED ME TO BE A FOOTBALLER ME AND MY BROTHER WOULD HAVE A KICK ABOUT DOWN THE PARK 
AND HE'D HAVE TO TURN UP KICK THE BALL YOU POOF 
HEADER IT YOU POOF 
AND IF YOU HEAR SOMETHING ENOUGH TIMES 
I CAN SMELL THE SPECIAL BREW I KNOW I'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE 
WE USED TO GO TRAINING AT ABINGTON PARK 
I USED TO MAKE HIM RUN UP THE HILLS AND HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT 
BUT I USED TO TRY AND GET HIM FIT 
ALL THE OTHER KIDS WOULD BE PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH THEIR DADS 
AND YOU'D HEAR LIKE LAUGHTER AND JOY AND THEN YOU'D HAVE MY DAD SAYING RUN FASTER RUN FASTER 
I WANTED HIM TO BE COMPETITIVE BUT IT WAS HARD WORK 
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT HE USED TO GET ME TO DO IT'S CALLED TOUCH THE TREES 
BECAUSE REMEMBER FOOTBALL ISN'T ABOUT SCORING GOALS IT'S ABOUT PHYSICAL FITNESS SO HE'D GO 
TOUCH THE TREE 
I'D TOUCH THIS THEN YOU'VE GOT TO RUN AND TOUCH THIS ONE 
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO RUN AND TOUCH THIS ONE HERE 
DO YOU GET THE GIST I KNEW I WAS FLOGGING A DEAD HORSE 
AND I WATCHED HIM TRAIN ONE NIGHT AND I SAW HIM RUNNING UP AND DOWN 
IT WAS GETTING A BIT DUSK BUT I COULD STILL PICK HIM OUT IN THE WHITE T. SHIRT 
NEVER SAW HIM TOUCH THE BALL AND WE GOT IN THE CAR 
AND I FELT A BIT SORRY AND I THOUGHT I MUST TELL HIM 
SO I SAID TO HIM LOOK ALAN YOU HAVEN'T GOT TO PLAY JUST COS OF ME 
IT WAS A BIT SAD BUT I THINK HE UNDERSTOOD AND I DON'T THINK HE WENT ANY MORE 
I SAID DAD I'M DOING A PERFORMING ARTS DEGREE 
HE SAID WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME 
I SAID I DON'T KNOW BUT I CAN SHOW YOU THROUGH EXPRESSIVE DANCE 
WELL WHEN I WOKE UP IN HOSPITAL 
IT'D BE GREAT BECAUSE THE HOTEL END WOULD SHOUT OUT ABOUT MY DAD 
HE'S FAT HE'S ROUND HIS FEET DON'T TOUCH THE GROUND 
GRAHAM CARR GRAHAM CARR 
AND ALL THAT 
YEAH THEY REALLY LOVED MY DAD IT WAS GREAT YEAH 
HE'S GOT NO HAIR WE DON'T CARE

BOY DID I HAVE BIG TEETH IF I'D GONE TO AFRICA I WOULD HAVE GOT POACHED 
I'D GET BULLIED FOR BEING CAMP THEN I'D GET BULLIED FOR WHAT MY DAD'S SCORES WERE AT THE WEEKEND 
IF THEY LOST I'D GET EVEN MORE BULLIED 
I USED TO GET PICKED ON COS I GET THAT SKIN DISORDER PSORIASIS 
THE MORE STRESSED I AM THE FLAKIER IT GETS 
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME ON MY DRIVING TEST IT LOOKED LIKE I'D BEEN DIPPED IN ALPEN 
I DID AN EMERGENCY STOP I LOST HALF MY BODY MASS HONESTLY MY FACE 
MY FACE FLEW OFF 
I MEAN I HAD A BIT OF A MISERABLE TIME HERE 
BUT IT'S SORT OF GIVEN ME SO MUCH MATERIAL IT'S A BIT LIKE MY DENTIST 
YOU KNOW HE SAID TO ME ALAN WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT YOUR TEETH 
HE SAID YOU NEED TO SORT THEM OUT I WENT NO COS I'LL LOSE FIFTEEN MINUTES OF MATERIAL

ALAN HAS HAD THE LAST LAUGH PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD A GO AT HIM IN THE PAST HE'S TURNED IT IN HIS FAVOUR 
BEFORE I GO I'D LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH HER MAJESTY 
AND I LOVE IT WHEN YOU GIVE OUT OBES AND THESE AWARDS TO PEOPLE LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE 
LIKE LOLLIPOP LADIES AND TOILET ATTENDANTS 
I MEAN IT MUST BE RUBBISH GOING BACK TO WORK ON THE MONDAY 
TOILET'S BLOCKED SHEILA DAME SHEILA 
A SWISH AND A SASHAY AWAY FROM NORTHAMPTON IS BEDFORD AND THE SHIP INN 
WHERE SLAPHEAD STAND UP AL MURRAY THE PUB LANDLORD

TWO HOURS' DRINKING I DUNNO YOU MIGHT GET GASSY EAT MORE NUTS THAN YOU PLANNED TO YEAH 
MAKE A CLUMSY PASS AT THE WOMAN RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU 
BUT THE POINT IS THIS 
TWO HOURS' THINKING GOD KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TWO HOURS' THINKING OOH 
MAYBE THE WAR AGAINST IRAQ IS SIMPLY A PETROL CRUSADE BY AMERICA TRYING TO PROP UP 
MAYBE I DO FANCY BOYS AH AH 
A TOWN WHICH HAD FAME THRUST UPON IT IS LUTON 
WHICH HAS ITS FAMOUS AIRPORT 
A POP GROUP MYSTERIOUSLY CALLED KAJAGOOGOO 
AND A FOOTBALL CLUB THAT ONCE BOASTED A MUCH MISSED ERIC MORECAMBE AS A DIRECTOR 
BUT WE ARE HEADING TO THE PLACE WHERE THE LOCAL PAPER WAS PUBLISHED 
IT WAS HERE THAT DAVID RENWICK THE MAN WHO WROTE ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE 
FIRST GOT PAID FOR SUCH LUCRATIVE THOUGHTS 
THIS MUST BE WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY I DON'T BELIEVE IT 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT LOOK AT THIS 
THIS IS CASTLE STREET CASTLE STREET LUTON WHERE I WORKED FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS ON THE LUTON NEWS 
THIS IS HOW IT USED TO LOOK PRETTY MUCH WHEN I WORKED THERE 
IN FACT THAT'S MY CAR I THINK IN MY EARLY THIRTIES 
I'D ALWAYS LIKED THE IDEA OF COMEDY WRITING AND I RATHER FOOLISHLY TOOK ON THE JOB OF JOURNALIST 
OF COURSE THE MINUTE I BECAME A REPORTER I DISCOVERED VERY LITTLE OF IT WAS TO DO WITH WRITING 
IT WAS ABOUT KNOCKING ON DOORS AND RINGING PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T WANT TO BE INTERFERED WITH 
I FIRST MET DAVID RENWICK IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN WHEN WE BEGAN AS JUNIOR REPORTERS ON THE LUTON NEWS 
WE STRUCK UP A GREAT FRIENDSHIP DAVID STEVE AND MYSELF 
WE ALL STARTED ON THE PAPER AT THE SAME TIME BUT EVERYONE KNEW AND I CERTAINLY KNEW 
THAT DAVID'S REAL AMBITION WAS TO BE A COMEDY SCRIPTWRITER 
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DON'T JUST PRINT THE CONFETTI AND BE DONE WITH IT 
MANY YEARS AGO I ASKED HIM HAVE YOU GOT ANY NEW SERIES ON THE GO 
AND HE WAS TELLING ME ABOUT AN ELDERLY MAN JUST RETIRED WHO WAS REALLY GRUMPY 
AND UPSET HIS NEIGHBOURS AND I THOUGHT I CAN'T REALLY SEE THAT WORKING 
MEANWHILE THE SPREADER OF THE DOOMSDAY DUNG MR. VICTOR MELDREW 
SIXTY ONE HAD THIS MORNING GONE TO GROUND 
GONE TO GROUND I'D GONE TO GATEWAY 
THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF REFERENCES TO NAMES AND PLACES AND DOCTORS 
AND PEOPLE THAT I KNOW TO BE HERE IN LUTON 
DOCTOR SNELLGROVE HAD TO GO TO A WEDDING 
I THINK WE WERE PASSING MOST OF HER PATIENTS TO DOCTOR WATSON 
HAS HE GONE TO LOOK FOR THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES 
CERTAINLY ONE CHARACTER IN ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE NICK SWAINEY 
I'M SURE WAS INSPIRED BY A LONG STANDING SPORTS EDITOR 
ON THE LUTON NEWS BRIAN SWAIN WHO WAS A REAL CHARACTER 
MORNING MRS. MELDREW 
MORNING 
IS IT ME OR IS IT MOIST 
I'M AFRAID WE HAVE GOT SOME READERS LIKE VICTOR YOU KNOW 
SOMETHING IS LEFT OUT OF THE PAPER ONE WEEK THEY'RE ON THE PHONE STRAIGHT AWAY 
BLOODY PAPER I MEAN HOW DO THEY MAKE THESE MISTAKES 
I CAN'T IMAGINE STILL BEING HERE NO I HAVE NIGHTMARES ABOUT IT 
EVERY TIME I NOD OFF I HAVE THIS HIDEOUS DREAM THAT I'M IMPRISONED 
IN A LUNATIC ASYLUM WITH ARTHUR ASKEY SINGING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW 
BUT IT WAS THE FIRST PAYING WRITING JOB I EVER HAD 
IF I FIND ONE MORE OF THOSE BLOODY STUPID LITTLE YELLOW NOTES 
I MAY NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MY ACTIONS 
NICE CHATTING WITH YOU MR. MELDREW 
HEADING TOWARDS THE CLASSY SUBURB OF BOREHAMWOOD WE CAN VISIT MY OLD SCHOOL 
HABERDASHERS' ASKE'S AN EXCELLENT ESTABLISHMENT WHICH STILL CHURNS OUT STAR PUPILS 
INCLUDING A DISTINGUISHED LINE OF JEWISH COMEDY TALENT 
LIKE MATT LUCAS SACHA BARON COHEN AND DAVID BADDIEL 
IF YOU'RE A WORKING CLASS COMIC AND YOU DO TOILET MATERIAL YOU GET CALLED THINGS LIKE EARTHY 
AND RABELAISIAN BUT IF YOU'RE A MIDDLE CLASS COMEDIAN YOU GET CALLED SCHOOLBOY 
AND UNDERGRADUATE SO INSTEAD I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT READING 
AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO ME TO BE ABLE TO DO IT 
WHILE I'M HAVING A SHIT 
HELLO APPARENTLY YOU'VE GOT COPIES OF ALL MY OLD SCHOOL REPORTS RIGHT O. K. 
I'VE BEEN BEATEN UP TWICE IN MY LIFE IN LONDON ONCE FOR BEING JEWISH ONCE FOR BEING A PAKISTANI 
LOOK AT THAT 
THAT'S ME WITHOUT MY GLASSES ON 
LOOKING INCREDIBLY INDIAN 
I'M NOT INDIAN I'M JEWISH 
I ALWAYS THOUGHT I DID A BIT BETTER THAN THIS I'M A BIT DISAPPOINTED DRAMA G. 
I'M LIKE SO BAD AT ACTING I GOT A G. WHICH IS BELOW F. 
CAN THAT BE THE CASE IT COULD BE 
OH THAT'S A BIT UPSETTING 
NOT YET WORKING TO CAPACITY POTENTIALLY EXCELLENT THAT'S ME ALL OVER 
THIS IS WHAT I THINK OF AS THE SCHOOL REALLY THIS IS THE KIND OF MAIN AREA 
IT'S MORE OR LESS AS IT WAS WHEN I WAS HERE THIS IS MY FIRST CLASSROOM 
AT MY SCHOOL IF YOU HAD FORGOTTEN YOUR SWIMMING KIT THEY MADE YOU DO IT IN THE NUDDY 
ALWAYS FORGETTING MY P. E. KIT AND SWIMMING TRUNKS 
SO I IMAGINE I WAS OFTEN IN THERE NAKED WITH MY TINY COCK YES 
WHICH OLD BOYS DO YOU KNOW ABOUT 
MATT LUCAS SACHA BARON COHEN 
DAMON HILL BUT HE'S A BIT YOUNG YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED ME SO FAR 
BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE I'M HERE YOU'RE OBVIOUS IT'S THE UNSPOKEN LAW REALLY 
WHEN YOU ARRIVE DOES SOMEONE HAND YOU A SHEET SAY THESE ARE THE FAMOUS BLOKES 
CONSIDERING THAT ALL HABS' BOYS ARE PRETTY ARROGANT WE KNOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE 
THAT WERE LIKE US AND HOW WE'LL BE WHEN WE'RE OLDER 
SO WE'VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT WE'VE GOT TO AIM FOR I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
NORTH LONDON HABS' BOYS ARE FULL OF THEMSELVES 
YES STOP SAYING THIS BUT YES YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS A COCKINESS 
DAVID BADDIEL 
YOU CAN'T GO ON STAGE AND MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH UNLESS YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE 
IN YOUR ABILITY TO AMUSE AND ENTERTAIN PEOPLE 
IF YOU WERE TO SUM UP WHAT YOU NEED TO BE A COMEDIAN 
YOU NEED TO BE COCKY BUT HOPEFULLY WITH CHARM 
HAVE YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND HAVE I GOT A GIRLFRIEND I DO BUT I'LL CHUCK HER IF YOU LIKE 
HABS WIT WAS VERY DRY AND VERY CUTTING 
YOU HAD TO BE VERY MUCH ON YOUR GUARD 
BECAUSE YOU COULD BE ATTACKED AND WOULD ATTACK OTHERS 
THAT WAS THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE SCHOOL 
ONE THING I'VE NOTICED ABOUT TEACHERS IS THAT THEY'VE ALWAYS GOT NAMES 
LIKE MR. PRATT OR MISS SHUFFLEBOTTOM RIGHT 
AND IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WHO THINK OH YEAH I'LL GO INTO TEACHING 
THERE'S A PROFESSION IN WHICH MY NAME WILL ESCAPE RIDICULE 
AS A TEACHER YOU HAD TO HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOUR 
OTHERWISE YOU JUST DIDN'T SURVIVE 
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO QUICK AT PICKING UP ANY LITTLE MANNERISM 
I THINK YOU ALSO NEEDED TO HAVE A PRETTY THICK SKIN AT TIMES 
SO THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY HALL AT HABERDASHERS' AND WE'RE HERE 
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE I DID MY FIRST EVER BIT OF COMEDY 
I WAS GOING TO GO TO CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY AND THEN 
TO GO TO CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY YOU HAD TO STAY ON AN EXTRA TERM AND WE ALWAYS HAD THIS THING 
THAT THE BOYS WHO HAD STAYED ON FOR THAT TERM IT WAS CALLED SIX S. WOULD DO A SCHOOL REVUE 
IT WAS PUT ON AT LUNCHTIME ON THIS STAGE 
AND ALL THE KIDS WOULD COME IN AND THERE'S LOTS OF CHAIRS THERE'S AN EXAM TODAY 
BUT THERE'S NORMALLY LOTS OF CHAIRS AND MY MEMORY OF GOING TO WATCH THE SCHOOL REVUE 
IS IT WAS BOYS SINGING QUITE NICE SONGS ABOUT HOW NICE IT WAS TO BE AT HABERDASHERS' 
AND HOW THEY LOOKED FORWARD TO GOING TO HOME OR WHATEVER AND JOKES ABOUT DOING HOMEWORK 
I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY BUT IT WAS RUBBISH AND IT WAS BOOED OFF 
WE CHANGED IT FROM BEING NICE SONGS ABOUT BEING AT HABERDASHERS' 
TO A SERIES OF EXTREME AND VICIOUS SKETCHES ABOUT INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS 
FOR SOME REASON WHICH NO ONE CAN QUITE FATHOM THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN 
NOT PUTTING IT BEFORE THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE 
IF THEY HAD I THINK CERTAIN THINGS WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN CUT OUT 
IT'S UPROAR THERE'S A BLOKE WITH A BEARD ON PRETENDING TO BE THE LIBRARIAN THE CHRISTIAN LIBRARIAN 
SHAGGING A BLOW UP DOLL AS THE LIBRARY ASSISTANT 
THAT'S THE CAMERAMAN LAUGHING 
IT'S ARMAGEDDON AS FAR AS THE TEACHERS ARE CONCERNED 
I SUPPOSE THE SCHOOL PROBABLY TOOK ITS EYE OFF THAT PARTICULAR PART OF IT REALLY 
WITH DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME PEOPLE I THINK 
THERE WERE A SERIES OF ATTACKS ON THE GEOGRAPHY DEPARTMENT 
TO THE SOUND OF THE RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES BY WAGNER 
I RAN AROUND IN A GOWN AND A JOCKSTRAP 
WE HAD ME AS THE HEAD OF MUSIC WITH A GREAT BIG BEAKY NOSE 
WITH I BELIEVE AN M. B. E. HANGING OFF IT 
SHOUTING AND SWEARING 
COME ON YOU BASTARDS SING 
LIKE REALLY SWEARING VIOLENTLY 
I DIDN'T DID I SAY FUCKING HELL SING 
SURELY I DIDN'T SURELY I WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN EXPELLED ON THE SPOT 
I THINK THEY DID CROSS THE LINE IT WAS VERY HARD HITTING IN PLACES 
I'D NEVER DONE COMEDY BEFORE IT'S STILL ONE OF THE BIGGEST RESPONSES I'VE EVER GOT 
THE CROWD WENT WILD AT THE TIME UNCONTROLLABLE CHEERING AND LAUGHTER 
THEY BANNED THE SIX S. REVUE FOR EVER 
HERE WE ARE TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER THE STAGE IS STILL WAITING FOR ANOTHER SCHOOL REVUE 
IT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE SO I'M SORRY BUT I THINK IT WAS WORTH IT 
AND IT WAS THEN THAT I THOUGHT I LIKED GETTING LAUGHS AND I THOUGHT THIS IS QUITE A GOOD JOB 
A SHORT DETOUR UP THE M. ONE BRINGS US TO WATFORD 
HOME OF TERRY SCOTT GINGER SPICE AND ELTON JOHN 
ITS MOST EASILY RECOGNISED COMEDY LANDMARK IS THIS 
THE WATFORD HILTON WHICH YOU PROBABLY KNOW BETTER AS THE LINTON TRAVEL TAVERN 
THE SOMETIME HOME TO RADIO NORWICH'S ALAN PARTRIDGE 
A HA 
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN A HOTEL FOR TWENTY SIX WEEKS 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO DAYS IN A TRAVEL TAVERN 
SEE THIS LOOK SANITARY BAGS 
THEY PUT THESE IN MY ROOM EVERY DAY THEY KNOW I'M A MAN 
I KEEP LOOSE WERTHER'S ORIGINALS IN THEM 
LOOK AT THIS SEE THIS 
THAT IS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO BOTTLES OF BODY LOTION 
I WAS GOING TO SELL THEM AT A CAR BOOT SALE 
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S LIKE TO DIAL A NUMBER FROM A TELEPHONE WITHOUT HITTING NINE FIRST 
HELLO IS THAT RECEPTION SORRY I MUST HAVE HIT THE ZERO 
THROUGH THE MAGIC OF TELEVISION WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE REAL VILLAGE OF LINTON 
JUST A SHORT PUNT ALONG THE RIVER CAM FROM CAMBRIDGE 
AND A FORMER TEMPERANCE HALL IN THE CITY 
IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF T. V.'S MOST SAVAGE SATIRE 
IN THE SEVENTIES TWO YOUNG ARTISTS WITH A TALENT FOR CARICATURE 
PETER FLUCK AND ROGER LAW SET UP A WORKSHOP HERE 
A DECADE LATER THEIR SCABROUS CREATIONS HIT OUR SCREENS 
AND THE MASS OF MODELS THAT WAS SPITTING IMAGE SNARLED INTO LIFE 
OH HELLO 
ARE YOU THE COMEDY MAP PEOPLE 
YOU DON'T LOOK VERY FUNNY TO ME 
WELL COME ON IN ANYWAY THERE'S LOTS I WANT TO TALL YOU ABOUT THOSE TWO BASTARDS 
PHILIP 
PUT THE KETTLE ON 
OH FOR GOD'S SAKE 
AREN'T YOU JUST SICK OF SEEING COMMON PEOPLE ON T. V. ALL THE TIME 
WELL HERE WE ARE ROGER VICTORIA HALL 
THIRTY YEARS SINCE WE WERE HERE YEAH 
OH WE CAME HERE IN SEVENTY SIX 
AND IRRITATED THE SHIT OUT OF ONE ANOTHER 
UNTIL THE START OF SPITTING IMAGE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY 
IT FEELS LIKE GOING TO WORK 
IT HAS CHANGED A BIT HASN'T IT 
IT'S MUCH SMALLER ISN'T IT 
IT'S MUCH NICER AS WELL YES 
I THOUGHT WE WERE STARTING EARLY THIS MORNING THIS REMINDS ME OF TOO MUCH WORK 
AND THE SMELL WAS PRETTY BAD AS WELL WASN'T IT 
WHAT ABOUT MAKING A NICE CUP OF TEA FLUCKY O. K. 
WE WERE AT ART SCHOOL IN THIS PICTURE 
BUT WHAT WAS GOING ON WAS 
THE C. N. D. MOVEMENT WAS BEGINNING TO REALLY TAKE HOLD 
THERE WAS A FEELING IN THE COUNTRY OF ABSOLUTE FEAR OF THE BOMB 
IT WAS A HUGE SOCIAL INTERNATIONAL ISSUE 
IT DID SORT OF POLITICISE A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE TIME 
MOTIVATION FOR MOST OF THE WORK WE DID WAS TO SAY THINGS 
THE CHEEKBONES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT 
THEY SORT OF PROTRUDE A LOT THEY SORT OF REALLY STICK OUT 
THE REASON THAT WE MADE THINGS AND PHOTOGRAPHED THEM 
WAS THE CARTOON ITSELF WAS EVAPORATING DISAPPEARING 
PEOPLE WEREN'T BEING RE HIRED AND WE COULDN'T GET THE KIND OF WORK DRAWING 
SO PHOTOGRAPHY WAS ALL THE THING LIKE YOU HAD COLOUR MAGAZINES 
SO YOU COULD DO A TOPICAL CARICATURE 
AND YOU GOT RID OF THE HANDWRITING 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO USE THEIR BRAIN AT ALL 
BECAUSE THEY'RE LOOKING AT A PHOTOGRAPH IT WAS EFFECTIVE 
THE OTHER THING WAS THAT IT MADE A DIFFERENT SORT OF IMPACT ON THE PAGE 
GENTLEMEN PRAY BE UPSTANDING FOR YOUR MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN 
THE QUEEN 
DON'T YOU WANT ME BY HUMAN LEAGUE 
GOOD EVENING BOYS 
GOOD EVENING YOUR MAJESTY 
THESE WERE SORT OF IDEA DRAWINGS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO OUTRAGEOUS 
SHE WAS JUST PERFECT FOR SPITTING IMAGE 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ORDER SIR YES I WILL HAVE A STEAK 
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT OH RAW PLEASE 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE VEGETABLES 
OH THEY'LL HAVE THE SAME AS ME 
SHE WAS THE MOTIVATION FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GO ALONG WITH THE IDEA AND WE'D HAD SIMILAR IDEAS 
THAT PEOPLE SAID LOOK COME ON GET OUT OF HERE 
BUT THATCHER MADE IT POSSIBLE BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE PRETTY ANGRY 
ABOUT IT ALL AND IT WAS CERTAINLY A LOT OF THE MOTIVATION FOR US TO ACTUALLY DO THE SHOW 
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE A BRAIN SURGEON TO WORK OUT 
WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO DO AND HERE WE ARE ALL THESE YEARS LATER 
AND SHE DID IT 
DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER BUSINESS I BLOODY WELL HOPE NOT WE'VE SOLD IT ALL OFF 
AT ONE POINT WHEN WE HAD HARDLY ANY PUPPETS WE WERE MAKING FOURTEEN PUPPETS A WEEK WHICH DAMN NEARLY KILLED US 
I ALWAYS HATED PUPPETS I LOATHE THEM 
IT'S JUST ONE STAGE AFTER ANOTHER YOU THINK IT'S NEVER GOING TO END 
WHAT YOU HAD TO DO WAS DRAW IT MODEL IT MOULD IT FOAM IT 
FIT IT UP FIND A VOICE FIND A PUPPETEER COSTUME CAMERA SET 
AND THEN YOU COULD DO IT 
YOU WERE ALWAYS INCREDIBLY STRESSED OUT 
IF YOU CARED AND WE DID 
SOME PEOPLE WANTED TO MAKE A VERY GOOD TELEVISION PROGRAMME 
OTHER PEOPLE WANTED TO BRING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT 
AND IN THE END WE WANT IT TO BE FUNNY AND PEOPLE TO WATCH IT 
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SEE SPITTING IMAGE LAST WEEK 
BUT IT WAS DISGUSTING 
IT IS ROUGH THAT'S HOW YOU GET ATTENTION 
THERE'S NO POINT IN SAYING TERRIBLY SORRY ABOUT THE ROYAL FAMILY JOKE AT THE END OF THE SHOW 
IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO WORK YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW DISRESPECT 
OOH COME AND GET YOUR BULLY THAT'S THE BULLSEYE 
WE USED TO GET A LOT OF ANGRY LETTERS VERY EMOTIONAL VERY BAD HANDWRITING 
THEY WERE A DELIGHT TO READ ACTUALLY 
WE'RE SICK TO DEATH OF YOUR IGNORANT VULGAR MINDS 
TAKE IT OFF T. V. VIEWERS LONDON KENT ESSEX DURHAM AND WORCESTER 
THE BAILIFFS MA'AM WHAT 
OH I MEANT TO TELL YOU I PUT EVERYTHING WE OWN 
ON TWIN OAKS FOR THE GRAND NATIONAL OH

WE ALL WANT TO SEE YOU GO 
SO WHEN YOU GO NOW AND THAT WAS EIGHTEEN MILLION PEOPLE 
GO NOW GO NOW 
GO NOW 
IT WAS RIGHT ON THE BUTTON AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK MADE IT WORK 
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT FOR THE MOMENT 
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO 
WHAT I SAID WAS THEY'RE A BUNCH OF YELLOW COMMIE SHORT ARSED 
SHIFTY SLUG EATING CHINKY SMELLY WOPPO SLITTY EYED BASTARDS AND WHAT DO THE PRESS DO 
THEY TAKE THE SLITTY EYED COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT AND MAKE ME LOOK A COMPLETE ARSEHOLE 
YES THOSE TWO BOYS HAVE GOT A LOT TO ANSWER FOR 
HMPH 
THE FINAL DESTINATION FOR TONIGHT'S COMEDY MAP IS CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY ITSELF 
SINCE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE SHARP UNDERGRADUATES WHO FOUND THEY COULD MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH 
AND HOPED TO AVOID HAVING TO DO A PROPER JOB 
JOINED LIKE MINDED FELLOWS AT THE CAMBRIDGE FOOTLIGHTS 
THIS IS WHERE FRY MET LAURIE MITCHELL MET WEBB AND MEL MET COMEDY PARTNER SUE

I GUESS WE SHOULD GO DOWN TO THE CELLAR 
POSH PEOPLE DEBATED UPSTAIRS AND IMPORTANT THINGS WERE DONE DOWNSTAIRS BOWELS OF HADES

YOU NEVER RUN OUT OF THAT 
HOWEVER YOU SHOULD ALSO AS WE'VE LEARNT SUBSEQUENTLY PROVIDE A STRUCTURE FOR IT 
BUT IT'S COMFORTING WE WERE MATES BEFORE WE WERE A DOUBLE ACT 
AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE MAINSTAY OF OUR HUMOUR
