THE VOTING'S OVER AND THE 
COUNTING'S BEGUN BUT WILL IT BE 
MAYDAY MAYDAY FOR GORDON BROWN 
TONIGHT WE BRING YOU THE LATEST 
NEWS FROM THE LOCAL ELECTIONS FOUR THOUSAND 
COUNCIL SEATS ARE UP FOR GRABS 
AROUND THE COUNTRY THE RESULTS 
CRUCIAL FOR BROWN AND CAMERON THE 
KEN AND BORIS SHOW IS OVER BUT WHO 
WILL TAKE CENTRE STAGE 
AND WHAT DOES THE FRITZL FAMILY'S 
ORDEAL TELL US ABOUT AUSTRIAN 
SOCIETY AND ITS CULTURE OF SECRECY 
THE BABYSITTER ACCUSED OF MURDERING 
A CHILD IS FREE TONIGHT AWAITING A 
RETRIAL FOLLOWING A NEWSNIGHT 
INVESTIGATION 
GOOD EVENING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN VOTING TODAY FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE 
COUNCILS IN ENGLAND AND WALES THE 
BIGGEST ELECTORAL TEST OF GORDON 
BROWN'S LEADERSHIP SINCE HE TOOK 
OVER AS PRIME MINISTER LAST YEAR A 
CRUCIAL ELECTION TOO FOR DAVID 
CAMERON WHO HAS SET HIS OWN TARGET 
FOR SUCCESS A MINIMUM OF FORTY PER CENT OF 
THE VOTE AND IN LONDON HAS BORIS 
MANAGED TO BEAT KEN WE WILL BE 
DISCUSSING ALL THIS WITH SENIOR 
POLITICIANS HERE IN THE STUDIO BUT 
FIRST TONIGHT OUR POLITICAL EDITOR 
MICHAEL CRICK HAS SPENT THE DAY IN 
BURY IN LANCASHIRE THE TORY TARGET 
HE JOINS US FROM THERE NOW WHY IS 
BURY SO CRUCIAL 
IT IS THE 
CONSERVATIVES' BID TARGET IN THE 
NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND IT IS 
CRUCIAL FOR THEM TO MAKE PROGRESS 
IN THE NORTH WEST BECAUSE THERE ARE 
SO MANY PARLIAMENTARY SEATS HERE 
THEY NEED TO WIN THEY CAN ALMOST 
FORGET ABOUT THE NORTH EAST AND 
SCOTLAND BUT THEY NEED TO MAKE 
PROGRESS IN THE NORTH WEST BERRY 
WOULD BE THE TEST OF THAT THEY 
TOOK OVER RUNNING BURY COUNCIL LAST 
YEAR BUT THEY ARE THREE WARDS 
SHORT OF AN OVERALL MAJORITY IF 
THEY GET THREE WARDS HERE TONIGHT 
THEY NEED A SWING OF FIVE PER CENT FROM TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
SO THAT IS A TOUGH TARGET IN A WAY 
BERRY HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN GORDON 
BROWN'S RECENT WOES IVAN LEWIS 
THE HEALTH MINISTER IS THE M. P. FOR 
BURY SOUTH SOME WEEKS AGO HE WAS 
TALKING ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNMENT 
WAS OUT OF TOUCH WITH ITS VOTERS 
MORE RECENTLY DAVID CHAYTOR THE 
M. P. FOR BURY NORTH WHOSE MAJORITY 
IS LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND IS UNDER THREAT 
AND HE WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS OF 
THE REBELLION ON THE TEN PENCE TAX 
LIMIT I WAS OUT TODAY AT THE 
POLLING STATIONS AND THE TEN PENCE 
TAX RATE OR THE ABOLITION OF IT WAS 
ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE WERE 
BRINGING UP AS TO WHY THERE WERE 
NOT VOTING LABOUR THIS TIME OR HAD 
THOUGHT OF NOT VOTING LABOUR FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN SIX YEARS GOING 
ROUND ON THESE MAY DAY POLLS IT 
WAS THE FIRST TIME NOT ONE VOTER 
MENTIONED THE WAR TO ME BUT THEY 
DID MENTION A WHOLE RANGE OF OTHER 
ISSUES AS TO WHY THEY HAD DESERTED 
THE LABOUR PARTY IT WAS NOT CLEAR 
THAT THE VOTE WAS GOING 
SUFFICIENTLY TO THE CONSERVATIVES 
FOR THEM TO MAKE THAT BREAKTHROUGH 
BUT IT WAS A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES 
STUDENT FEES PREFERENTIAL 
TREATMENT THAT PEOPLE PERCEIVE THAT 
THE SCOTS ARE GETTING HEALTHCARE 
AND SO ON AS I WENT ROUND THE 
POLLING STATIONS THIS AFTERNOON 
TALKING TO THE VOTERS 
A LOT OF MY FATHER'S FAMILY COME 
FROM BURY AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE 
NEVER LIVED HERE I REMEMBER AS A 
BOY MY GRANDMA OFTEN CAME UP WITH 
THIS RHYME DREAMT I WAS DEAD AND 
TO HAVE ENDED GO WHERE DID YOU 
COME FROM THEY WANTED TO KNOW L. L. 
SAID I AM FROM BURY SAINT PETER DID 
STARE HE SAID STEP INSIDE LAST 
YOU ARE THE FIRST ONE FROM THERE 
THE TOWN BOASTS OF HAVING THE BEST 
MARKET IN THE COUNTRY BUT IS 
PROBABLY MOST FAMOUS AS THE HOME OF 
BLACK PUDDINGS HAVE YOU GOT THE 
BLACK PUDDINGS WITH THE BIG LUMPS 
OF FAT IN THE MIDDLE YEP GREAT YEP GREAT BERRY'S MOST FAMOUS SON IS THE NINETEENTH 
CENTURY PRIME MINISTER SIR ROBERT 
PEEL WIDELY RECOGNISED AS FIRST 
LEADER OF THE MODERN CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY TRADITIONALLY THIS TOWN HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN 
OTHER LANCASHIRE MILL TOWNS THEY 
TEND TO ELECT TORY M. P.'S WHEN THE 
PARTY HOLDS POWER AT WESTMINSTER 
NO WONDER PEEL'S SUCCESSORS DAVID 
CAMERON AND WILLIAM HAGUE HAVE 
MADE SEVERAL VISITS IN THIS 
CAMPAIGN MOORSIDE IS ONE OF FOUR 
WARDS HERE THE TORIES HAVE TARGETED 
TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE COUNCIL 
HAVE YOU JUST VOTED CERTAINLY AND CERTAINLY AND WE ARE FROM THE B. B. C. WHICH PARTY 
DID YOU VOTE FOR 
THERE IS A NEED 
FOR CHANGE 
IS THERE A REASON FOR 
THAT 
THIS TEN PENCE TAX STUFF SO THAT SO YOU HAVE NOT VOTED LABOUR WHO DID 
YOU VOTE FOR INSTEAD NO 
THEY ARE NO NOT LISTENING 
DID YOU VOTE FOR 
TONY BLAIR WANTS 
ONCE YES BUT 
THERE HAS TO BE CHANGED 
WHY DID 
YOU VOTE CONSERVATIVE 
JUST FAMILY 
BE IT IS A TRADITION 
YOUR DAD WILL 
NOT LIKE THAT 
NOT ALL THOSE WHO 
HAVE DESERTED LABOUR HERE HAVE GONE 
STRAIGHT TO THE CONSERVATIVES SOME 
WILL HAVE ABSTAINED OTHERS PICKED 
THE LIB DEMS A SURPRISING NUMBER 
ADMITTED TO ME TODAY VOTING FOR THE 
BRITISH NATIONAL PARTY 
I VOTED B. N. P. 
DO YOU NORMALLY VOTE FOR THEM WHAT 
MAKES YOU VOTE FOR B. N. P. 
BECAUSE I 
AM BRITISH 
THANK YOU 
WELL PUT IT 
THIS WAY HAVE VOTED ALL MY LIFE 
FOR LABOUR AND I AND SEVENTY SEVEN L. HAVE 
BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY THEY 
HAVE HANDLED WHEN THEY GOT IN IN 
NINETY SEVEN I THOUGHT IF THEY DO THINGS 
RIGHT THE TORIES WILL NEVER GET IN 
AGAIN AND REALLY THEY HAVE 
SLIPPED UP BADLY 
WAS THAT ENOUGH 
TO STOP YOU VOTING LABOUR THIS 
TIME YES 
WHO DID YOU GO FOR TIME YES INSTEAD 
INDEPENDENT L. WOULD NOT INSTEAD VOTE TORY ON PRINCIPLE 
MANY TOYED 
WITH THE IDEA OF GOING ELSEWHERE 
BUT A STRONG CANDIDATE IN THIS WAR 
HELPED SHORE UP LABOUR'S VOTE 
DESPITE GRUMBLES OVER MANY DIVERSE 
ISSUES 
I AM A POLICE OFFICER ISSUES OBVIOUSLY WITH THE WHOLE THING 
ABOUT THE BACKDATED PAY JACQUI 
SMITH WAS OBVIOUSLY ON MY MIND BUT BUT YOU DID VOTE LABOUR 
I DID L. HAVE 
VOTED LABOUR ALL MY VOTING LIFE 
WAS THAT BECAUSE OF LOCAL ISSUES 
YEAH THE LABOUR CANDIDATE HAS DONE 
A LOT FOR THE AREA AROUND HERE 
THANK GOD BECAUSE WE MAY HAVE BEEN 
WAVERING OTHERWISE 
SO IF IT WAS A 
GENERAL ELECTION YOU MIGHT NOT 
HAVE VOTED LABOUR 
POSSIBLY NOT 
OUR WAS DENTED BY CONSERVATIVE FOR 
THE FIRST TIME EVER REASONS REASONS REASONS I WAS TEMPTED WERE STUDENT 
FEES WE HAVE TO PAY FOR OUR 
DAUGHTER THEY DO NOT PAY FOR THEIR 
FEES IN SCOTLAND CARE FOR THE 
ELDERLY 
BUT IN THE END YOU STUCK ELDERLY WITH LABOUR 
WE STUCK WITH LABOUR 
YOU THOUGHT OF LEAVING LABOUR AS 
WELL BUT FOR ANOTHER PARTY THE THE AIR FOR THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
WHAT WAS YOUR REASONING LOSING LOSING CONFIDENCE IN BROWN THE TEN PENCE 
TAX SITUATION IT IS AN INDICATION 
OF HIS INABILITY TO GOVERN THE 
COUNTRY 
BUT YOU TOO STUCK WITH COUNTRY LABOUR 
FOR THE TIME BEING THEY LABOUR THEY ARE ON PROBATION 
THE VERY MUCH SO 
IF THE TORIES TO TAKE CONTROL OF 
BURY TONIGHT THEY WILL HAIL IT AS 
A BREAKTHROUGH IN REGION WHERE 
THEY NEED TO WIN LOTS MORE 
PARLIAMENTARY SEATS IF THEY FAIL 
HERE THOUGH IT WILL INEVITABLY 
FUEL THOSE DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER 
DAVID CAMERON CAN NEVER SUCCEED IN 
NORTHERN ENGLAND 
THE BATTLE ROYALE IN THESE 
ELECTIONS HAS BEEN THE BARE KNUCKLE 
FIGHT BETWEEN BORIS JOHNSON AND KEN 
LIVINGSTONE TO BE LONDON MAYOR 
BORIS HAS BEEN IN THE CLOSE CARE OF 
CONSERVATIVE CENTRAL OFFICE AND 
CAN HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO WAIT HIS 
CLOSE FRIEND LEE JASPER FARE WELL 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAMPAIGN 
DAVID GROSSMAN JOINS ME FROM THE 
GREATER LONDON AUTHORITY BUILDING 
WHAT IS GOING ON 
I AM JEALOUS THAT 
MICHAEL HAS SOME ACTIVITY TO REPORT 
ON TONIGHT THEY FINISHED VOTING 
HERE IN LONDON BUT THEY DO NOT 
START COUNTING UNTIL TOMORROW WE 
MAY NOT EVEN HAVE A RESULT UNTIL 
THIS TIME TOMORROW NIGHT HOPEFULLY 
A BIT EARLIER BUT WE ARE NOT 
GUARANTEED A RESULT UNTIL LATER 
TOMORROW NIGHT THE ONLY THING WE 
HAVE TO GO ONE TODAY IS THE FINAL 
POLL WHICH PUTS BORIS JOHNSON SIX 
POINTS AHEAD ON FIFTY THREE PER CENT AGAINST KEN 
LIVINGSTONE'S FORTY SEVEN PER CENT BUT I WILL 
CHARKIN EIGHT HEALTH WARNING ON 
THAT THE POLLS IN THIS LONDON 
CONTEST HAD BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE 
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE 
DECIDED AT THE END OF ALL THIS IS 
WHICH POLLING ORGANISATION ENDS UP 
WITH EGG ON ITS FACE FRANKLY THEY 
CANNOT ALL BE RIGHT 
THERE ARE 
GREATER LONDON ASSEMBLY POSITIONS 
AS WELL 
YES AND THEY SHOULD BE 
INTERESTING NOT LEAST BECAUSE 
THERE IS A TOP UP MECHANISM IN 
LONDON A RULE OF THUMB IS THAT IF 
YOU GET FIVE PER CENT OF THE VOTE YOU WILL 
GET ONE OF THE TOP UP SEATS EIGHT PER CENT 
WILL MEAN TWO AT THE LAST ELECTION 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE B. N. P. CAME WITHIN A 
WHISKER OF GETTING ONE OF THOSE 
SEATS WILL THEY GET BACK SEAT THIS 
TIME AND IF SO WHAT HAPPENS HOW 
WILL THE REST OF THE POLITICIANS 
REACT THE SECOND QUESTION IS UKIP 
THE LAST LONDON ELECTIONS TOOK 
PLACE AT THE LAST TIME AS THE SAME 
SAME TIME AS THE EUROPEAN 
ELECTIONS SO IT FOCUSED MINDS ON 
THE EUROPEAN QUESTION WHICH MEANT 
THEY ENDED UP WITH TWO OF THOSE 
TOP UP SEATS THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO 
TO REPEAT THAT THIS TIME BECAUSE 
THOSE TWO GLA MEMBERS ENDED UP 
DEFECTING TO OTHER PARTIES SO IT 
IS NOT THE GREATEST SPRINGBOARD FOR 
THAT WILL THE GREENS BUILD ON 
THEIR REPUTATION IT IS ALL A 
SIDESHOW THE MAIN QUESTION IS 
WILL KEN LIVINGSTONE REPEAT HIS 
VICTORY OF LAST TIME AND TIME 
BEFORE THAT A THIRD TIME AS LONDON 
MAYOR CONFIRMING HIMSELF AS MR. 
LONDON OR WILL BORIS JOHNSON WITH 
A FIRST TIME HAROLD AND PERHAPS A 
NEW GOLDEN AGE FOR THE CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY HERALDING A NEW GOLDEN 
AGE 
WHY ARE THESE JOURNALISTS OUTSIDE 
MY HOUSE 
CAN LIVINGSTON HAD AN AIR 
OF CONFIDENCE FATALISM ABOUT IN 
THIS MORNING HE STROLLED TO THE 
POLLING STATION ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY 
A DOZEN OR SO JOURNALISTS AND WON 
OVERWHELMING QUESTION IS HIS LEAST 
ON CITY ALL ABOUT TO EXPIRE I I THINK IT WILL BE A REALLY CLOSE ONE 
ALL PARTIES WILL BE RUSHING TO GET 
THE BOAT OUT L. THINK I WILL WIN 
BUT YOU CANNOT BE CERTAIN THERE THERE WAS MUCH MORE OF A SCRUM AROUND HIS 
OPPONENT BORIS JOHNSON SOME 
QUESTIONED WHETHER HE WOULD BE ABLE 
TO SURVIVE THE INTENSITY OF THE 
CAMPAIGN WITHOUT MAKING SOME SORT 
OF MONUMENTAL GAFFE HIS TEAM WHO 
THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH POTENTIAL 
CONSERVATIVE VOTERS OUT THERE TO 
SECURE IN VICTORY COMPARING 
DIFFERENT ELECTIONS IS DIFFICULT 
BUT ROUGHLY IN LONDON SINCE TWO THOUSAND 
THE CONSERVATIVES NORMALLY GET 
BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY AND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND VOTES BUT 
AT THE LAST LOCAL ELECTIONS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
THAT FIGURE JUMPED TO NEARLY 
SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND VOTES LONDON APPEARS TO BE 
BECOMING MORE CONSERVATIVE THE 
TREND APPEARS TO BE WITH BORIS 
JOHNSON 
WE WERE SO TOXIC IN TWO THOUSAND JOHNSON STEVE NORRIS WAS THE CONSERVATIVE 
CANDIDATE FOR THE LAST TWO MAYORAL 
CONTEST HE SAYS BORIS JOHNSON IS 
RUNNING IN FAR MORE FAVOURABLE 
CONDITIONS THAN HE EVER ENJOYED 
NOW DEPENDS WHICH POLLS YOU LOOK 
AT BUT PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY 
POINTS MORE FAVOURABLE TO THE 
TORIES THAN WE WERE FOUR YEARS AGO 
THAT CREATE A DIFFERENT CLIMATE IN 
LONDON BECAUSE THERE IS NO DOUBT 
THAT AS IN ALMOST ANY OTHER LOCAL 
ELECTION IN BRITAIN PEOPLE WILL 
VOTE VERY MUCH AS A VERDICT ON THE 
GOVERNMENT MAYBE THEY SHOULD NOT 
BUT THEY WILL IF YOU TAKE THAT 
INTO ACCOUNT AND YOU TAKE KEN'S 
FAILING FORTUNES INTO ACCOUNT WHAT 
THAT MARKS OVER EIGHT YEARS IS A 
REMARKABLE TRANSFORMATION IN THE 
TORIES' FORTUNES 
IF WE EXAMINE THE 
FIRST PREFERENCE VOTES AT THE LAST 
MAYORAL ELECTION IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE 
RESULT WAS BY NO MEANS A LANDSLIDE 
JUST ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE THOUSAND VOTES SEPARATED KEN 
LIVINGSTONE FROM STEVE NORRIS THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY WON THE ELECTION 
FOR LONDON ASSEMBLY KEN 
LIVINGSTONE WAS THEN MORE POPULAR 
THAN HIS PARTY THE QUESTION IS IS 
HE STILL 
THE LIB DEM CANDIDATE BRIAN 
PADDICK ARRIVED AT HIS LOCAL 
POLLING STATION FOR A PHOTOCALL HE 
HAD ALREADY VOTED BY POST THE 
ELECTORAL SYSTEM MEANS THAT THE 
SECOND PREFERENCE VOTES OF HIS 
SUPPORTERS AND THOSE OF THE OTHER 
SMALLER PARTIES WILL PROBABLY BE 
END UP 
UP BEING REDISTRIBUTED 
BETWEEN LABOUR AND THE 
CONSERVATIVES IN WHAT PROPORTIONS 
WELL THAT COULD BE A DECISIVE 
QUESTION ANOTHER KEY VARIABLE WILL 
BE TURNOUT IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR IT WAS THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT 
MANY EXPECT THAT FIGURE TO GO UP 
BUT WILL IT BE ANY EVEN INCREASE 
IN WHICH CASE IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR 
KEN LIVINGSTONE OR WILL VOTERS IN 
MORE CONSERVATIVE OUTER BOROUGHS 
TURN OUT MORE THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
NEWS FOR BORIS JOHNSON FOR ONCE 
THE NATIONAL PARTY LEADERS WERE NOT 
THE CENTRE OF ATTENTION AS THEY 
CAST THEIR VOTES IN LONDON TODAY 
BUT WHAT HAPPENS HERE WILL HAVE AN 
IMPACT ON THEM THE LONDON MAYOR 
WILL VOTE VOTE WILL FORM THE 
BACKDROP OF BRITISH POLITICS FOR 
SOME TIME TO COME 
JEREMY VINE WILL BE WORKING 
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT MAKING SENSE 
OF THE RESULTS AS THEY COME IN FOR 
NEWSNIGHT CRY HE HEARS TELLING US 
WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR THE MAIN 
PARTIES TONIGHT FOR NEWSNIGHT 
HERE HE IS 
YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE QUITE A LOT 
OF PLACES INCLUDING THE SOUTH WEST 
THE SOUTH WEST WHEN NO ONE GETS 
A VOTE IN THESE ELECTIONS THIS YEAR 
CONSERVATIVES RIGHT TO SAY THERE 
IS NOT A WHOLE LOT MORE THEY CAN DO 
IN QUITE A FEW AREAS TONIGHT AND 
THEY HAVE GOT A LOT OF THESE 
COUNCILS ALREADY IF THEY GET MORE 
THAN TWO HUNDRED NEW SEATS TONIGHT THEY 
ARE DOING VERY WELL INDEED 
CAERPHILLY HELD BY LABOUR A TWO PER CENT 
SWING TO PLAID CYMRU THE WELSH 
NATIONALISTS WOULD MAKE IT HUNG 
COUNCIL IN THE SOUTH EAST OF 
ENGLAND RED INK LABOUR SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
READING TOWN A FOUR PER CENT SWING WOULD 
MAKE IT A HUNG COUNCIL ONE OF ONLY 
TWO LABOUR DISTRICTS UP NUNEATON 
AND BEDWORTH A FOUR PER CENT SWING WOULD MAKE 
IT A CONSERVATIVE COUNCIL 
LIVERPOOL IS LIB DEM COUNCIL BUT 
A BAD AUDIT ASSESSMENT LABOUR MADE 
GAINS LAST YEAR THEY WILL HOPE TO 
TAKE THAT COUNCIL AT SOME POINT 
TONIGHT NEXT YEAR WHENEVER THEY 
WANT IT BACK LET'S GET SOME 
POLITICAL CONTEXT AND SEE WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED TO THE VOTE IN THE LAST 
DECADE GOING BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
LABOUR'S LANDSLIDE ELECTION FORTY FOUR PER CENT 
OF THE VOTE THE CONSERVATIVES WAY 
BEHIND BUT YOU WILL SEE HOW THEY 
VOTE DROPS EVEN EARLY ON IN THE 
BLAIR GOVERNMENT IN THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS 
THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR LOCAL ELECTIONS WORTH 
POINTING OUT BECAUSE THE TWENTY SIX PER CENT YOU 
CAN SEE BEHIND THE LIB DEMS WAS 
LABOUR'S LOWEST EVER IT WAS ALSO 
THE YEAR WHEN MOST OF THE SEATS 
TONIGHT WERE LAST FOUGHT BUT IN 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE THEY WON THE GENERAL SO TO THE POLL 
I WOULD SHOW YOU THE FIRST 
STATEMENT WHICH PARTY IS A DIVIDED 
PARTY LAST YEAR'S RESULT FIRST 
SIXTY FOUR PER CENT OF PEOPLE SAID LABOUR WHAT 
HAPPENED THIS YEAR 
LABOUR LOOK A BIT LESS DIVIDED THAN 
THEY DID LAST YEAR THE 
CONSERVATIVES THE SAME THE LIB 
DEMS ABOUT THE SAME THE NEXT 
QUESTION WHICH PARTY CAN BE 
TRUSTED TO RUN BRITAIN'S ECONOMY 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE THREE 
PARTIES THIS YEAR LABOUR 
CONSERVATIVE AND THE LIB DEMS 
RIGHT DOWN REFLECTIVE OF GENERAL SENSE OF ECONOMIC WOES 
WE START WITH GORDON BROWN ASSET 
OR LIABILITY 
A CLEAR MARGIN IN FAVOUR OF HIM 
BEING A LIABILITY PEOPLE THINK HE 
IS DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD 
ABSOLUTELY EQUAL TONY BLAIR A 
BETTER SCORE THAN GORDON BROWN 
DAVID CAMERON SUBSTANTIALLY MORE 
PEOPLE SEE HIM AS AN ASSET TO HIS 
PARTY THAN A LIABILITY 
THE POLITICAL WEATHER WILL BE SET 
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND WEEKS BY 
THE LONDON MAYOR ELECTION WE KNOW 
VERY WELL ALL THE CARTOON 
CHARACTERS WHO HAVE COME OUT OF 
THAT CONTEST IN YEARS GONE BY RED 
KEN AND LORD SNOOTY THEY HAVE BEEN 
HAVING A RUMBLE THIS YEAR SOMEONE 
GOT HIT IN THE EYE WITH AN OYSTER 
CARD 
THE POLLS SINCE MARCH INTERNET 
POLLS FIRST THEY GAVE BORIS 
JOHNSON A SUBSTANTIAL LEAD BUT IN 
MORE TRADITIONAL POLING IN APRIL 
IT WASN'T QUITE THE SAME KEN 
LIVINGSTONE WAS JUST AHEAD WITH FORTY ONE 
PER CENT IT'S ALL TO PLAY FOR IN LONDON 
A VITAL CONTEST ON NATIONAL SCALE 
WE WILL NOT KNOW THE ANSWERS AS TO 
WHO HAS WON UNTIL FRIDAY 
TWO KEY AREAS FOR THE PARTY TONIGHT 
THE MIDLANDS AND WALES IN A MOMENT 
PATRICK BURNS IN BIRMINGHAM FIRST 
WE GO TO THE VALE OF GLAMORGAN 
FOR LABOUR IN WALES A SIMPLE 
QUESTION IF THERE IS AN ANTI 
LABOUR SWING DO THEY FEEL THE FULL 
FORCE OR DO THEY WEATHER THE STORM 
THEY DID NOT REALLY FOUR YEARS AGO 
THEY LOST CARDIFF BRIDGEND 
SWANSEA AND EVENTUALLY WREXHAM TO 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS IF THEY LOSE 
MORE GROUND TONIGHT THEY WILL HAVE 
FALLEN LONG WAIT IN A DECADE THE 
LIB DEMS WILL DO WELL TO HOLD ON TO 
WHAT THEY HAVE GOT A LONG WAY IN 
A DECADE THE CONSERVATIVES ARE THE 
FIFTH PARTY IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN 
WALES CAN THEY IMPROVE AND 
LEAPFROG PLAID CYMRU THEY ARE THE 
PARTY OF NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IN 
WALES NOW OF COURSE HOW HAS THAT 
PLAYED FOR THEM ON THE DOORSTEPS 
CAN BE READ RAIN REGAIN SOME OF 
THE GROUND THEY LOST FOUR YEARS AGO 
WHAT IS THE WHISPER JUST A WHISPER 
AT THIS POINT IS THAT TURNOUT IS 
AT BEST PATCHY COULD IT BE THAT 
AS LABOUR FEARS THE CORE LABOUR 
VOTE HAS NOT REALLY TURNED OUT IN IN THE WEST MIDLANDS IF LABOUR 
APPEARED TO HAVE LITTLE TO LOSE 
IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE LITTLE LEFT 
TO LOSE THEY ARE DOWN TO THEIR 
LAST THREE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHERE 
THEY HAVE OVERALL MAJORITIES 
NUNEATON AND BEDWORTH NOTABLY THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE MOUNTING A 
CHALLENGE THERE THEY NEED JUST FOR 
MORE WARDS FOR AN OVERALL MAJORITY 
AS THEY DO IN CHELTENHAM FOUR 
MORE IN WORCESTER THE 
CONSERVATIVES NEED ONLY ONE MORE 
WARD TO REGAINED THE OVERALL 
MAJORITY THEY WON A YEAR AGO THEY 
SUBSEQUENTLY LOST IT IN A BY 
ELECTION LAST SEPTEMBER DOMINATED 
BY THE UNPOPULARITY OF FORTNIGHTLY 
WHEELIE BIN COLLECTIONS NOW IT MAY 
BE CHALLENGING FOR THE TORIES TO 
PICK UP THAT ONE EXTRA SEAT THAT 
LOCAL ISSUE IS VERY MUCH ALIVE IN 
THIS CONTEST ELSEWHERE THE TORIES 
MAY HAVE A BATTLE ON THEIR HANDS TO 
RETAIN THE BIG METROPOLITAN 
AUTHORITIES PARTICULARLY COVENTRY 
DUDLEY AND WALSALL THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS WILL BE SO BATTLING TO 
STOP THE CONSERVATIVES GETTING AN 
OVERALL MAJORITY IN SOLIHULL AND 
ALSO CEMENTING THEIR POSITION ON 
THE RULING COALITION THE RULING 
COALITION COALITION I AM JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY THE 
CABINET OFFICE MINISTER ED 
MILIBAND THE SHADOW WORK AND 
PENSIONS MINISTER CHRIS GRAYLING 
AND SIMON HUGHES THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS DAMPING DOWN 
EXPECTATIONS 
THAT WILL POSE DIFFICULT TIMES FOR 
A GOVERNMENT THAT'S THE BACKDROP 
OF THESE ELECTIONS 
THAT'S THE 
DIFFICULT ECONOMIC BACKDROP PART 
OF IT BEING THE TEN P. INCOME TAX 
DECISION THE DECISION TO RULE THAT 
OUT WHAT HAPPENS NOW YOU HAVE IN 
THAT POLL SIXTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE SAYING 
LABOUR IS DIVIDED PERHAPS YOU'RE 
BEING PUNISHED THE TEN P. TAX FEWER FEWER THAN A YEAR AGO 
THAT'S COLD 
COMFORT 
IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION COMFORT TO GET RID OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE IT IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID BY JACK STRAW 
AND GORDON BROWN THAT IT WAS A 
DISASTER 
IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION DISASTER BUT WE MADE TWO MISTAKES GORDON 
SAID THAT HIMSELF ABOUT THE PEOPLE 
WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPENSATED 
HELPED OUT IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES ON THE 
DOORSTEP 
YOU WERE TOLD ABOUT IT DOORSTEP LAST YEAR YOU HEARD PEOPLE SAY IT 
SIGNALLED GORDON BROWN WASN'T 
THINKING ENOUGH ABOUT THE ISSUES 
IT WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES THE SIGN 
OF A GOOD GOVERNMENT IS THAT YOU 
LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
TOO LATE 
IT ISN'T TOO LATE FOR 
PEOPLE WATCHING THIS PROGRAMME WHO 
WANT TO BE HELPED OUT AS A RESULT 
OF WHAT HAPPENED AND ARE GOING TO 
BE 
CHRISTOPHER GRAYLING DAVID BE CAMERON SET THE BAR AT FORTY PER CENT IT 
SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN SET AT FORTY FIVE PER CENT YOU YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ELECTIONS 
WE'RE IN A POSITION WHERE WE'VE 
ALREADY WON A LOT OF THE SEATS 
BEING FOUGHT TONIGHT WE'RE ALREADY 
THE DOMINANT PART IN LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT ALSO IN SOME OF THE 
METROPOLITAN AREAS WE'RE STARTING 
FROM A LOW EBB IN LIVERPOOL FOR 
EXAMPLE WE HAVE NO COUNCILLORS THE 
BEST SHARE OF VOTE WE HAVE IS TWENTY PER CENT 
WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING A VIGOROUS 
CAMPAIGN IN PARTS OF LIVERPOOL I'M 
CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL SEE OUR SHARE 
OF THE VOTE GO UP WE'LL NOT SEE 
COUNCILLORS IN ONE GO IT TAKES 
TIME TO REBUILD 
YOU'RE SAYING IT 
TAKES TIME TO REBUILD DAVID 
MILIBAND SAID THE SAME THING NO 
ONE IS CONFIDENT 
I'M CONFIDENT 
WE'LL SEE SOME GOOD GAINS SOME 
INTERESTING GAMES BUT YOU DON'T 
WANT TO OVERPLAY THE EXPECTATION 
THAT SOMEHOW WE'RE GOING TO ROMP 
OFF TO GET FORTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE VOTE IS 
UNREALISTIC UNREALISTIC DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING GET MORE 
THAN ONE HUNDRED GAINS 
I'M NOT A 
FORECASTER EITHER ED AND I HAVE 
THAT IN CONFIDENT IF NOT MANY 
OTHER THINGS THESE ARE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS YOU HAVE MANY PLACES 
WHERE LOCAL FACTORS WILL BE WHAT 
DETERMINES WHAT HAPPENS L. THINK 
WE'RE BEST TO WAIT FOR THE RESULTS 
LOOK AT THE I. C. M. POLL THE TWO 
THINGS THAT DAVID CAMERON MADE 
GREAT PLAY ABOUT THE N. H. S. WAS THE 
FIRST PRIORITY AND OF COURSE 
CLIMATE CHANGE INTERESTINGLY ON 
BOTH THESE AREAS SURPRISINGLY ON 
ONE WAY LABOUR IS TRUSTED MORE 
THIS WAS YOU SAYING VOTE BLUE GO 
GREEN THAT WAS YOUR KEY PLANK AND 
YOU HAVEN'T WON THROUGH ACCORDING 
TO THAT POLL 
IF YOU MAKE A 
COMPARISON FROM FOUR OR FIVE YEARS 
LABOUR WERE A MILE AHEAD OF US 
IT'S A SIGN PROGRESS THAT NOW IN 
MOST POLLS THERE AND THEREABOUTS 
CONFIDENCE IN THE N. H. S. 
SIMON DO 
YOU THINK AT THE END OF THESE 
ELECTION RESULTS YOU'LL BE SAYING 
SORRY MING WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT YOU 
WHERE SNURP 
WE NEVER LOOK BACK 
THAT'S NOT A WAYS THING TO DO 
WE'VE MADE A GOOD START WITH NICK 
I 
THINK WE WILL A SEE PROGRESS L. L. THINK WE'LL BE WINNING SEATS IN THE 
NOEFRT IN THE MIDLANDS AND THE 
SOUTH IN THE NORTH IN THE 
MIDLANDS AND THE SOUTH WE'RE 
PROBABLY THE ONLY PARTY MAKING 
PROGRESS ACROSS THE COUNTRY CHRIS 
WAS UNDERGROUND STATING THE FACT OF 
THE TORIES' ABSENCE IN LIVERPOOL 
NEWCASTLE MANCHESTER AND THEY'VE 
DISAPPEARED IN THE NORTH IN LOTS 
AND LOTS OF PLACES 
YOU'RE COASTING 
ON THE SAME KIND OF PERCENTAGE YOU 
WERE UNDER MING CAMPBELL THERE'S 
NO SIGN THAT NICK CLEGG HAS MADE 
ANY IMPACT 
WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY IN 
THE LAST FEW YEARS BEEN BETWEEN TWENTY THREE PER CENT 
AND TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT IN THE LOCAL ELECTION SHARE 
OF THE VOTE CONSISTENTLY IT'S A 
THREE PARTY SYSTEM IN ENGLISH 
POLITICS FOUR PARTY SYSTEM IN 
WELSH AND SCOTTISH POLITICS WE'VE 
LABOUR ARE IN DIFFICULTY SOME OF 
THEIR OWN MAKING AND CERTAINLY ON 
THE GROUND NATIONAL ISSUES ARE 
PLAYING VERY STRONGLY NOT LEAST 
THE TEN P. MISTAKE THEY MADE IN THE 
LAST FEW WEEKS 
I WANT TO TALK 
ABOUT LONDON IN A MOMENT FIRST ED 
MILIBAND YOU CAN'T BLAME IT ALL ON 
THE MID TERM AND THE BAD ECONOMY 
YOU HAVE A NEW LEADER IT TOOK TONY 
BLAIR TEN YEARS TO BECOME AS 
UNPOPULAR AS GORDON BROWN HAS 
BECOME IN SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD 
HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HANG ON TO TONY 
BLAIR 
I 
DON'T AGREE WITH THAT L. BLAIR DON'T THINK TONY BLAIR DOES EITHER 
WE HAVE THE RIGHT LEADER IN GORDON 
BROWN I'LL TELL YOU Y. BECAUSE IN 
DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES THIS IS 
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO SHOW 
TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE TOUGH 
TIMES IN THEIR LIFE HE'S THE RIGHT 
PERSON TO TAKE PEOPLE THROUGH THE 
DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES 
HE'S NOT 
COMMUNICATING THAT 
SOMEBODY WHO 
HAS BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL 
CHANCELLOR SINCE THE WAR LET'S LET'S TURN NOW TO BORIS AND KEN 
BORIS HAS BEEN IN AN EXTREMELY 
TIGHT REIN ARE YOU KEEPING YOUR 
FINGERS AND TOES CROSSED THAT IF 
HE'S ELECTED TOMORROW THAT THAT 
REIN WILL AT LEAST IN THEORY STAY 
IN PLACE 
I THINK BORIS HAS COME 
INTO HIS OWN IN THIS CAMPAIGN HE'S 
A KNOWN FIGURE A VERY HIGH PROFILE 
CELEBRITY FIGURE BUT WHAT YOU'VE 
SEEN IN THIS CAMPAIGN IS A SERIOUS 
POLITICIAN WITH A CLEAR AGENDA HE HE HAS BEEN GIVEN AN ANTI HUMOUR PILL 
THIS IS NOT THE BORIS JOHNSON THAT 
WE KNOW 
WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN BORIS 
HAS A SERIOUS SIDE TO HIM HE'S A 
VERY SMART MAN A VERY EFFECTIVE 
POLITICIAN HE'S DEMONSTRATED THAT 
IN THIS CAMPAIGN PERHAPS A YEAR OR 
TWO AGO NONE OF US WOULD HAVE 
EXPECTED ANY CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE 
TO COME FORWARD AND GIVE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE AN INSTITUTION IN HIS 
OWN RIGHT A RUN FOR HIS MONEY 
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED WHATEVER 
THE RESULT KEN HAS BEEN UNDER REAL 
PRESSURE 
BORIS HAS COME OUT OF HIS PRESSURE OWN OVER THE LAST THERE'S A 
SERIOUS SIDE AND FUNNY SIDE THE 
FUNNY SIDE IS THAT BORIS IS STILL 
THE CHARACTER BUT HE HAS BEEN 
REPRESSED THE SERIOUS SIDE IS THAT 
HERE IS SOMEBODY STANDING FOR THE 
TORIES TO REPRESENT THE CAPITAL 
CITY WHO STOOBG ZERO INTEREST IN 
LONDON UNTIL ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS AGO 
BRIAN PADDICK COULD NOT MAKE AN 
IMPRESSION 
THAT'S COMPLETELY IMPRESSION UNTRUE HE MADE A VERY GOOD AND 
SERIOUS IMPRESSION BUT IN THE END 
NOT LEAST BECAUSE ONE EVENING PAPER 
IN LONDON PORTRAYED IT AS A TWO 
HORSE RACE DESPERATE FOR KEN TO BE 
BEATEN BY THE TORIES IT LOOKS AS 
IF IT WAS A TWO HORSE RACE EVEN 
WHEN IT WASN'T EARLIER ON 
THE WAY 
THAT KEN DEALT WITH LONDON WAS A 
NEW LABOUR MODEL IT WAS A 
FANTASTIC INCREASE IMPACT ON 
TRANSPORT AND SO FORTH THROWING 
LOTS OF PUBLIC MONEY AROUND IF HE 
LOSES IT'S A DISASTER FOR YOU 
IT'S BAD NEWS FOR LONDON IF HE 
LOSES I THINK KEN HAS BEEN VERY 
GOOD MAYOR AND I THINK ON THE 
ISSUES OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
TRANSPORT AND POLICING HE'S THE 
RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB VERY MUCH 
HOPE HE WINS OF COURSE I DO WE'LL WE'LL WAIT TO AT LEAST HALFWAY THROUGH 
TOMORROW TO UNDERSTAND IF EITHER OF 
THESE MEN WILL WIN THE ELECTION FOR 
LONDON MAYOR COMING UP 
THE TOWN OF AMSTETTEN IN AUSTRIA 
WAS ROCKED BY THE FRITS FAMILY'S 
ORDEAL ORDEAL VOTING HAS CLOSED FOR THE ELECTIONS 
IN ENGLAND AND WALES WITH MOST OF 
THE RESULTS TO BE DECLARED DURING 
THE NIGHT THE OUTCOME OF THE 
ELECTION FOR THE MAYOR OF LONDON 
AND LONDON ASSEMBLY WILL BE 
ANNOUNCED TOMORROW 
THE APPEAL COURT HAS QUASHED THE 
CONVICTION OF THE BABYSITTER 
SUZANNE HOLDSWORTH OF THE MURDER OF 
KYLE FISHER LAST NIGHT IN 
NEWSNIGHT JOHN SWEENEY RAISED 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF HER 
CONVICTION TONIGHT HE REPORTS ON A 
DISTURBING CASE 
KYLE FISHER WAS A HEALTHY LITTLE 
BOY UNTIL HE FELL MORTALLY ILL AT 
THE BABYSITTERS THEREFORE THE 
BABYSITTER SUZANNE HOLDSWORTH MUST 
HAVE MURDERED HIM BUT THAT SIMPLE 
LOGIC CAME UNSTUCK WHEN NEW MEDICAL 
EXPERTS SAID KYLE HAD AN EIGHTY PER CENT CHANCE 
OF SUFFERING AN HE LIB DEM 
PARTICULAR FIT EPILEPTIC FIT AND 
THAT COULD HAVE KILLED HIM TODAY 
THE APPEAL COURT RULED THAT THE 
MURDER CONVICTION AGAINST 
HOLDSWORTH WAS UNSAFE AND CLEARED 
THE WAY A 
AFTER THREE YEARS IN PRISON 
HOLDSWORTH HAS BEEN GRANTED BAIL 
SHE'S ALWAYS DENIED MURDER L. SPOKE 
TO HER WHEN SHE WAS IN PRISON LAST 
DECEMBER HOW DID THAT INJURY TO 
HIS EYE HAPPEN 
I DON'T KNOW I 
WASN'T THERE 
DID YOU DO IT PARDON DID YOU DO PARDON THAT 
NO NO I WASN'T EVEN THERE THAT HER BOYFRIEND LEE SPENCER WAS 
RELIEVED AT TODAY'S OUTCOME LET'S LET'S NOT FORGET WHY IT IS A CHILD HAS 
DIED YEAH WE CAN BE EXCITED AND 
CHUFFED TO BITS THAT THE COURTS 
HAVE LISTENED TO THE NEW EVIDENCE 
AND FOUND IT TO BE A MISCARRIAGE OF 
JUSTICE BUT A CHILD IS STILL DEAD 
THE PROSECUTION ARGUE THAT 
HOLDSWORTH MUST HAVE SLAMMED KYLE'S 
HEAD AGAINST THE BANNISTER AT HER 
HOME WITH A FORCE YOU'D SEE IN A SIXTY 
M. P. H. CAR CRASH 
BUT THERE WAS NO BLOOD D. N. A. OR 
DENT ON THE BANNISTER 
FAR FROM BEING HEALTHY THE APPEAL 
COURT HEARD THAT KYLE HAD NOT ONLY 
A GENETIC BRAIN A NORMALITY BUT 
ALSO BRAIN DAMAGE FROM A YEAR OLD 
INJURY LOOK AT KYLE'S RIGHT EYE 
THE REASON IT WAS DROOPING WAS 
BECAUSE THE BRAIN HAD PUSHED 
THROUGH HOLE IN 
THE EYE SOCKET THE COURT HEARD LIKE TOOTHPASTE 
SQUEEZING THROUGH A TUBE THE 
COURT WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THE BRAIN 
INJURY HAD BEEN CAUSED WHEN KYLE 
FELL FROM HIS BUGGY A YEAR BEFORE 
HE DIED WHILE HE WAS IN THE CARE 
OF HIS MOTHER CLAIRE FISHER 
SO THE JURY NEVER GOT TO HEAR OF 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF KYLE'S ABNORMAL 
BRAIN OR THE BRAIN INJURY THAT 
EITHER ONE OR BOTH COULD HAVE 
KILLED HIM AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE SO 
ONE HAS TO ASK WHY ON EARTH NOT 
FACE SURGEON PROFESSOR BRIAN AVIARY 
AND SID MARKS PLANNED TO OPERATE ON 
KYLE SIX MONTHS BEFORE HE DIED 
CLEVELAND POLICE DID NOT TAKE 
STATEMENTS FROM EITHER SURGEON 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CLEVELAND 
POLICE MURDER TEAM DID INVESTIGATE 
THE BRAIN INJURY AND DECIDED THAT 
IT WAS OLD AND IRRELEVANT TO THE 
MURDER INQUIRY AND ON THAT POINT 
TODAY'S VERDICT IN THE APPEAL COURT 
SUGGESTS THEY WERE WRONG 
THE RETRIAL WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE 
AUTUMN AUTUMN SUZANNE HOLDSWORTH CONTINUES TO 
DENY THAT SHE EVER HARMED KYLE 
PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE OF 
THE LONDON SUICIDE BOMBINGS HAS 
BEEN SHOWN AT THE TRIAL OF THREE 
MEN ACCUSED OF CONSPIRING WITH THE 
JULY SEVENTH BOMBERS THE FILM SHOWS 
PEOPLE FLEEING AFTER TANDRAGEE 
DETONATED HIS DEVICE ON A LONDON 
UNDERGROUND TRAIN HEADING TOWARDS 
AULD GATE IN JULY TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
AND THE MARKETS 
ELIZABETH FRITZL HOW ELIZABETH 
FRITZL AND HER CHILDREN WHO HAVE 
BEEN HIDDEN FOR YEARS ALSO VICTIM 
OF NEWSNIGHT'S HAS BEEN TRYING TO 
FIND OUT HOW SUCH HORROR WAS NEVER 
DETECTED AND THE IMPACT IT HAS HAD 
ON AUSTRIA AND ITS PEOPLE 
UNTIL THIS WEEK AMSTETTEN WAS ONE 
OF THOSE LITTLE AUSTRIAN TOWNS 
WHERE NOTHING EVER SEEMED TO HAPPEN 
IT'S NOT IN THE MOUNTAINS SO 
THERE'S NO SCENERY OR SKIING AND 
WELL OVER AN HOUR'S DRIVE FROM THE 
GRAN TOUR AND CULTURE OF THE 
CAPITAL VIENNA IT'S SIMPLY 
PLEASANT IN A WAY IT SUMS UP 
MODERN AUSTRIA A NEUTRAL 
PROSPEROUS MEMBER OF THE E. U. 
ALTHOUGH PERHAPS LACKING IN 
IDENTITY BUT ANY SENSE OF NATIONAL 
CONTENTMENT HAS BEEN SHATTERED BY 
WHAT HAPPENED HERE 
AMSTETTEN AND AUSTRIA ARE NOW KNOWN 
WORLDWIDE FOR THE HORRIFIC EVENTS 
WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THIS TOWN NOT 
FAR FROM THE CENTRE OF TOWN WHERE 
JOSEF FRITZL IMPRISONED HIS 
DAUGHTER 
IN BASEMENT FOR TWENTY YEARS IN WHICH TIME SHE BORE SEVEN OF HIS CHILDREN CHILDREN A LODGER WHO RENTED A ROOM IN THE 
HOUSE FOR TWELVE YEARS TOLD THE B. B. C. HE 
SAW ANOTHER MAN GOING DOWN TO THE 
CELLAR CELLAR 
HE DIDN'T GET MANY VISITORS SOMETIMES RELATIVES OR 
FRIENDS WOULD COME TO THE HOUSE 
BUT ONE TIME FRITZL INTRODUCED 
INTRODUCED ME TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO 
HAD COME HE SAID HE WAS A PLUMBER 
AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO DOWN TO 
THE CELLAR 
JOSEF FRITZL SEEN HERE 
ON HOLIDAY IN THAILAND IS OF 
COURSE IN CUSTODY BUT CURRENTLY 
REFUSING TO ANSWER POLICE QUESTIONS 
THE REACTION TO THE STORY ACROSS 
AUSTRIA HAS BEEN ONE OF SHOCK AND 
HORROR 
IT'S A REAL DISASTER IT'S HORROR VERY SERIOUS IT WAS SOMEHOW LIKE 
NINE ELEVEN FOR THE AMERICANS COMPLETE 
DIFFERENT CASE BUT FROM THE 
FEELING AND THE EMOTION IN THIS 
COUNTRY IT HIT THEM VERY HARD 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAD THE CASE 
BEFORE FOR A LOVE US IT'S 
UNBELIEVABLE 
WE ARE ALL VERY VERY UNBELIEVABLE EMBARRASSED THE PEOPLE IN THE 
MEDIA ARE EMBARRASSED THE 
NEIGHBOURS ARE EMBARRASSED THE 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE EMBARRASSED 
I CANNOT THINK THAT IN SOME WEEKS 
EVERYTHING WILL BE LIKE IT WAS 
BEFORE BEFORE VIENNA THE AUSTRIAN CAPITAL IS 
ONE OF THE CULTURAL AND TOURIST 
CENTRES OF EUROPE FAMOUS FOR ITS 
ARCHITECTURE COFFEE SHOPS AND 
MUSEUMS IT'S RIGHTLY PROUD THAT IT 
WAS HOME OF GREAT COMPOSERS LIKE 
MOZART AND BEETHOVEN WHO BOTH 
SETTLED HERE AND THE WRITER 
DOCTOR AND FATHER OF PSYCHO 
ANALYSIS FREUD THE CITY HAS 
ENJOYED MAGNIFICENT HISTORY BUT 
DID INCLUDE WHAT SOME AUSTRIAN CALL 
THE BLACK PERIOD IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT AUSTRIA 
WAS FORCIBLY UNITED WITH GERMANY 
THE ERA LASTED UNTIL AFTER THE 
SECOND WORLD WAR WHEN THE ALLIES 
MOVED IN AND OCCUPIED THE COUNTRY 
THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARGUE THAT THE 
NAZI LEGACY HAS LEFT ITS MARK 
LAST NIGHT NEWSNIGHT KAUBGD TO 
NATASHA KAMPUS CHFPLT WHO WAS 
ABDUCTED AND HELD FOR EIGHT YEARS 
BEFORE SHE ESCAPED WHY DO EVENTS 
LIKE THIS SEEM TO HAPPEN HERE IN 
AUSTRIA IS IT JUST BAD LUCK OR 
SOMETHING MORE 
I 
THINK THIS EXISTS WORLDWIDE BUT I 
THINK IT'S ALSO A RAMIFICATION OF 
THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
AND IT'S CONNECTED TO EDUCATION AND 
SO ON 
I THINK IT CAN HAPPEN EVERYWHERE 
IT ALSO EXISTS EVERYWHERE NOT JUST 
IN AUSTRIA 
YOU MENTIONED THE 
SECOND WORLD WAR IN WHAT WAY 
AT THE TIME OF NATIONAL SOCIAL IFL THE SUE PETROL 
STATION OF WOMEN WAS PROPAGATEED 
AND AUTHORITARIAN EDUCATION WAS 
VERY IMPORTANT 
PROFESSOR MAX FRIEDRICH IS THE 
PSYCHIATRIST WHO TREATED NATASHA 
AFTER HER ORDEAL HE TOO BLAMES 
THE LEGACY OF THE NAZI ERA AS A 
POSSIBLE LINK TO THE TWO CASES 
BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SEES AS THE 
AUSTRIAN TRAIT OF NOT WANTING TO 
GET INVOLVED NOT WANTING TO REPORT 
ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS 
BETWEEN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AND NINETEEN FORTY FIVE THERE WERE MANY SPIES HERE WHO 
INFORMED ON THEIR NEIGHBOURS AFTER 
THE WAR THESE PEOPLE WERE 
OSTRACISED AND AS A RESULT PEOPLE 
WOULD NOW RATHER LOOK AAWITH AN BE 
THOUGHT OF AN AS INFORMANT SO SO AUSTRIA IS SUFFERING BECAUSE OF ITS 
HISTORY 
THAT'S RIGHT WE'RE HISTORY SUFFERING BECAUSE OF OUR HISTORY 
AUSTRIA NEEDED TIME TO HEAL ITSELF 
WE'RE NOW GOING IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION P. U. WE SHOULD LOOK AT A 
SECOND ASPECT IT'S NO COINCIDENCE 
THAT FREUD DEVELOPED HIS PROFOUND 
PSYCHOLOGY HERE IN VIENNA 
EVERY PIANIST IN EVERY COFFEE SHOP 
IN VIENNA KNOWS THE THEME OF THE 
FILM THE THIRD MAN THE GRAHAM 
GREEN STORY OF DES PIESD EVIL AND 
APPARENTLY RESPECTABLE IN VIENNA 
IT'S A THEME THAT ATTRACTED THE 
AMERICAN 
DECADE WHO YOU SEE NO VIOLENCE ON 
THE STREETS IN AUSTRIA BUT YOU HAVE 
THESE DEVIANT CHARACTERS THAT COME 
UP ONCE IN A DECADE WHO SHOCK THE 
ENTIRE NATION AND SHAKE UP THE 
POLITICAL SYSTEM 
THOSE WHO LIVE A 
SECRET LIFE IN AUSTRIA ARE HELPED 
IT'S ARGUED BY NEIGHBOURS KEEPING 
QUIET AND BY PRIVACY LAWS THAT 
ENSURE DETAILS OF CRIMINAL RECORDS 
ARE WIPED AFTER A NUMBER OF YEARS 
FIFTEEN YEARS IN THE CASE OF RAPE 
IT'S NOW KNOWN THAT FRITZL WAS 
CONVICTED OF RAPE IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN 
ACCORDING TO REPORTS IN THE 
AUSTRIAN PRESS BUT IT SEEMS THIS 
WAS NEVER LOOKED INTO WHEN HE AND 
HIS WIFE ADOPTED WHAT TURNED OUT TO 
BE HIS OWN CHILDREN BY HIS OWN 
DAUGHTER DAUGHTER NOT ONLY IS THERE NOT SEX OFFENDERS 
REGISTER THE CRIMINAL RECORDS ARE 
THE CONFIDENTIAL PROPERTY OF THE 
CRIMINAL COURTS OR THE DISTRICT 
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE EVEN THE CIVIL 
COURT DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THESE 
CRIMINAL RECORDS NOR DID THE CHILD 
PROTECTIVE SERVICES WHICH IN THE 
CONTEXT OF THIS ADOPTION ACTUALLY 
WENT TO THE GUY'S HOUSE LOOBGSD 
AROUND TALKED WITH THE GUY 
LOOKED AROUND TALKED WITH THE GUY 
EXAMINED THE CHILDREN BUT UNAWARE 
OF THE PREVIOUS RAPE CONVICTION SO SO IT'S EASY FOR SOMEONE TO GO ON 
LIVING A DOUBLE LIFE EVEN IF THEY 
HAVE A CRIMINAL CONVICTION IT IT WOULD APPEAR SO 
SOUL SEARCHING IN 
AUSTRIA IS JUST STARTING ALONG NO 
DOUBT WITH A DEBATE ON HOW THE 
POLICE SHOULD DEAL WITH SEX 
OFFENDERS AND THEIR RECORDS 
THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT IS TO 
LAUNCH A P. R. CAMPAIGN TO TRY TO 
RESTORE THE COUNTRY'S BATTERED 
IMAGE AS WITH THE HEALING OF THE 
VICTIMS OF THESE HORRIFIC CASES 
THE PROCESS WILL SURELY TAKE TIME 
MORE ON THE LOCAL ELECTIONS NOW WE 
CAN GO BAULK TO BURY WHERE OUR 
POLITICAL EDITOR MICHAEL CRICK HAS 
BEEN LOOKING AT THE LATEST RESULTS 
WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY RESULTS YET 
WE'RE NOT EXPECTING TO KNOW IF THE 
TORIES ARE EXPECTING TO TAKE 
CONTROL OF THE BURY COUNCIL UNTIL 
ABOUT ZERO IN THE MORNING BOTH 
PARTIES ARE BEING CAUTIOUS ABOUT 
HOW THINGS ARE GOING L. SUPPOSE 
LABOUR IS SLIGHTLY MORE GLOOMY THAN 
THE CONSERVATIVES I'VE BEEN 
SPEAKING TO THE LABOUR M. P. FOR BURY 
NORTH THE MORE MARGINAL OF THE TWO 
SEATS HERE AND OF COURSE HE WAS 
ONE OF THE LEADING REBELS ON THE 
WHOLE TEN P. TAX BAND ISSUE HE SAYS 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE GREAT NIGHT 
FOR THEM HERE BUT ON THE OTHER 
HAND HE ARGUES IT'S NOT GOING TO 
BE ANYTHING LIKE AS BAD AS PEOPLE 
PREDICTED HE SAID THE MOOD THAT 
HE'S PERCEIVED ON THE DOOR STEPS 
TODAY IS THAT PEOPLE ARE UNCERTAIN 
THAT THE PUBLIC MOOD IS NOT HOSTILE 
THOUGH PARTICULARLY TO LABOUR MY 
OWN EXPERIENCE FROM GOING ROUND ONE 
OF THE MARGINAL WARDS THAT HAVE 
BEEN THE BATTLEGROUNDS IN THIS 
PARTICULAR BOROUGH IS THAT I DIDN'T 
COME ACROSS LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE 
WHO WERE NEW CONSERVATIVES THERE 
WERE FEW WHO SWITCHED FROM LABOUR 
OR OTHER PARTIES BUT NOT IN LARGE 
NUMBERS I SUPPOSE THE QUESTION 
MARK IS HAVE THE TORIES DONE 
ENOUGH HERE TONIGHT TO WIN CONTROL 
AND GIVE THEM THAT BOOST FOR THEIR 
WHOLE CAMPAIGN IN THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND

WESTERN PARTS OF THE U. K. THAT WILL 
CLEAR AND CLOUD BUBBLING UP 
GENERALLY THROUGH THE DAY WITH A 
SCATTERING OF SHOWERS BREAKING OUT 
BY THE AFTERNOON BUT THEY WILL BE 
FAIRLY WELL SCATTERED ACROSS

WILL FEEL QUITE WARM FIFTEEN ACROSS 
EAST ANGLIA SEVENTEEN IN CENTRAL LONDON

WILL TEND TO COME AND GO THE 
SUNSHINE BUT STILL DECENT ENOUGH 
ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND MORE 
SHOWERS AROUND MAYBE NOT AS MANY 
AS TODAY BUT STILL THE ODD HEAVY 
ONE TO WATCH OUT FOR PROBABLY THE 
HEAVIEST SHOWERS OF THE DAY 
RESERVED FOR SCOTLAND EDINBURGH 
FOR EXAMPLE INVERNESS WILL CATCH 
ONE OR TWO HEAVY SHOWERS FOUR OR 
FIVE DEGREES THE HEAVY 
MORE HEAVY RAIN HEADING IN FOR 
SATURDAY THE MAIN TREND FURTHER

SOUTHERLY WINDS BRINGING A WARMER 
FEELING TO THE WEATHER EVERYWHERE
