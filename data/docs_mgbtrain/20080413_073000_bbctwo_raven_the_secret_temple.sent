WHERE THEY MUST UNDERGO MANY TRIALS 
TO FIND THE MAGICAL WATERS TO BREAK THIS SPELL 
BUT MY ENEMY HAS FOLLOWED ME HERE 
AND HE MEANS TO STOP THIS QUEST AT ANY COST 
THE QUEST TO DISCOVER THE SECRET TEMPLE 
EACH TEAM HAS NOW COMPLETED ONE OF THE FOURTEEN TESTS THEY MUST ENDURE 
BEFORE ANY IS ALLOWED TO ENTER THE SECRET TEMPLE 
THE JEWELS COLLECTED MARK HOW WELL THEY ACCOMPLISH THESE CHALLENGES 
YESTERDAY THE PANTHERS TIGERS AND WOLVES EACH GAINED FOUR JEWELS 
BRINGING THEIR TOTAL TO TEN 
THE EAGLES FARED LESS WELL AT THE RIDDLE TRAP THEY GAINED BUT THREE 
AND NOW HOLD NINE IN ALL 
THEY WILL STRIVE I AM CERTAIN NOT TO FALL FURTHER BEHIND 
AS THEY EXECUTE TODAY'S CHALLENGES 
SONRO AT THE START OF THESE CHALLENGES 
YOUR LEADERSHIP WAS QUESTIONED 
I'M GETTING ALONG WITH THEM NOW AND BECOMING A BETTER LEADER 
ARTON WELL HE CAN BE SOMETIMES BUT SOMETIMES HE FORGETS ABOUT STUFF 
SO HE'S STILL GOT A LONG WAY TO GO 
AND AKSU 
I THINK HE'S BECOME BETTER FROM THE FIRST CHALLENGE 
BUT HE SHOULD STILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS 
TODAY THE WARRIORS WILL BE TESTED ON THEIR COURAGE SPEED 
AGILITY AND LEADERSHIP AS THEY FACE THE SECOND OF THE FOURTEEN TASKS 
UNDER THE BURNING SUN OF THIS MYSTERIOUS LAND 
SO LET THE DAY'S CHALLENGES BEGIN 
WARRIORS THE TEMPLE YOU SEE BEFORE YOU LIES IN RUINS 
AND ITS PROUD COLUMNS ARE BUT STEPPING STONES FOR YOU TO CROSS 
YONDER LIE THE JEWELS YOU SEEK 
TO REACH THEM YOU MUST EACH LEAP FROM ONE PILLAR TO THE NEXT 
THIS TASK REQUIRES GREAT BRAVERY 
FOR IT IS YOUR COURAGE WE TEST HERE TODAY 
REMEMBER IF ANY OF YOU SHOULD FALL HERE 
YOUR QUEST COULD COME TO AN END 
BUT TO BE HESITANT COULD ALSO BE YOUR UNDOING 
AS SPIRIT GUARDS WILL PUNISH THOSE OF YOU WHO WILL NOT JUMP 
CAN I GO LAST O. K. SO IT'S HADAV SOHAR ME THEN JENRO 
YEP GOOD LUCK HADAV 
HADAV SHOWS HIS BRAVERY BY TACKLING THE PILLARS FIRST 
WILL THIS PROVE RASH 
COME ON HADAV YOU CAN DO IT GO ON 
JUST A SMALL JUMP 
I DON'T WANT TO GO NEXT I'LL SWAP WITH YOU IF YOU LIKE 
DO YOU WANT TO GO SECOND OR LAST SOHAR 
I'LL GO LAST 
WARRIORS WHEN CROSSING THIS TREACHEROUS CAUSEWAY 
AVOID HASTE FOR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR FOOTING 
REMEMBER YOUR AGILITY WILL BE TESTED IN THIS PLACE 
A WARRIOR WITH A STRONG COMMAND OF MOVEMENT AND BALANCE WILL DO WELL 
BUT BE WARNED NOT ALL THE POUCHES YOU SEE HERE 
WILL YIELD THE JEWELS YOU SEEK 
BE WARY OF OVERSTRETCHING YOURSELVES SO THINK CAREFULLY 
BEFORE YOU PUT YOURSELF YOUR COMRADES 
OR THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION AT RISK 
RIGHT WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST 
YEAH I'LL GO FIRST AND PUT THE FIRST YEAH BUT 
I'LL GO SECOND YEAH ARTON SHOULD GO SECOND 
AND YOU GUYS FOLLOW ON WE SHOULD GO FROM THERE TO THERE

FOR AKSU YONRA AND ARTON TO FOLLOW 
SHALL AKSU FOLLOW ON NOW NO WAIT 
ARE YOU SURE YOU SHOULDN'T GO FOR THAT ONE COS IT'S CLOSER 
WE'LL COME BACK TO IT ARE YOU SURE COS THAT MIGHT BE A MIX UP

PUT IT IN YOUR BAG IF YOU'VE FINISHED I CAN'T OPEN IT 
BE CAREFUL YES 
YEAH IT'S A GOLD ONE PUT IT IN YOUR BAG AND THROW THAT ONE AWAY 
THE CASKET IN THE CENTRE OF THIS CIRCLE CONTAINS THE JEWELS 
THE WARRIORS SEEK 
BEFORE THEM LIES A THREE ROPED HOOK THEY MUST USE TO RETRIEVE THE STONES 
AND COMPLETE THE TASK 
THE MAN SITTING NEAR THE GEMS CHANTS TO KEEP THE SPIRIT GUARDS ASLEEP 
BUT ONCE THE WARRIORS LIFT THE ROPES HIS MANTRA WILL CEASE 
THE SPIRIT GUARDS WILL WAKEN AND BEGIN TO PATROL THE CIRCLE 
IF ANY ARE TOUCHED BY THE ROPES A WARRIOR WILL PERISH 
YEADA LEADER OF THE EAGLES MUST NOW LEAD HER TEAM TO SUCCESS 
WHEN WE ALL GET TO OUR POINTS 
I'LL SHOUT OUT STEP ACCORDING TO THEIR PACE SO WE'RE ALL IN TIME

THE KITES REEL AND CIRCLE IN THE HEAVENS 
AND THE FOUR WINDS THAT BLOW ACROSS THIS LAND ARE STILL TODAY 
AS STILL AS DEATH 
THE WARRIORS ARE IN DANGER I AM CERTAIN OF IT 
AND NEVAR 
HE STAYS AWAY 
I DO NOT FEEL HIS PRESENCE 
HE SENDS ONLY HIS DARK FORCES TO DISRUPT THE TASKS 
THEN DO NOT FEAR THEY WILL NOT SUCCEED

TIGERS YOU MUST MAKE A CHOICE 
HADAV IS LOST TO YOU 
BUT SATYARANI WILL ALLOW THE USE OF EIGHT OF YOUR HARD WON JEWELS 
TO BUY HIM BACK THE DECISION MUST BE MADE 
WHAT SHALL WE DO I DON'T KNOW 
WE'RE GOING TO GO FROM THIRTEEN DOWN TO FIVE 
THAT'S NEARLY TEN JEWELS GONE 
BUT THEN WE'VE LOST HADAV 
WOULDN'T IT BE BEST IF WE ROLLED A DICE WE NEED JEWELS 
BUT WE ALSO NEED PLAYERS I THINK WE SHOULD ROLL A DICE 
WHAT'S YOUR DECISION 
ARE YOU TWO FINE WITH ME ROLLING A DICE FINE THAT'S O. K. 
WE'LL ROLL A DICE MARCA WHAT HAVE YOU DECIDED 
WE'RE GOING TO ROLL A DICE 
VERY WELL 
EVENS WE GET HIM ODDS WE DON'T 
SO HADAV WILL BE BROUGHT BACK 
BUT FOR THIS EIGHT JEWELS ARE REQUIRED 
SO BE IT 
I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I FELL OFF THE SECOND PILLAR 
IN PILLARS OF COURAGE 
I FELT THAT THE DECISION OF ROLLING THE DICE WAS FAIR 
AND WAS RELIEVED TO GET BACK INTO THE TIGERS 
IT WAS HARD TO MAKE THE DECISION 
BECAUSE WE SAID WE'D BRING HIM BACK THEN WE WORKED IT OUT 
THAT WE'D ONLY HAVE FIVE JEWELS LEFT 
SO WE ROLLED THE DICE AND LUCKILY IT CAME UP FOR HADAV 
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO IT AT FIRST 
BUT WHEN I SAW HADAV FALL I LOST MY CONFIDENCE 
BUT I DID IT AND I GOT A JEWEL AS WELL 
IS THAT STEADY IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO SLIP BE CAREFUL 
WHY DON'T YOU TRY FROM THERE TO THERE I COULD 
BUT IF IT'S NOT STEADY I'M NOT DOING IT NO DON'T 
IS IT GOOD CHECK IT THAT LOOKS OH DON'T EVEN TRY IT 
IT LOOKS FINE NO GET BACK NOW 
SONRO PROVES HIMSELF AGILE ON THE BRIDGE BUT DOES THIS MAKE HIM 
A WORTHY LEADER 
COME ON THAT'S REALLY GOOD 
YES GOT ONE WELL DONE 
WAIT OH MY GOSH QUICK 
COME ON LEAVE THE REST 
QUICK YEAH 
DON'T GO THAT FAST REMEMBER 
THAT IS QUITE A LOT ISN'T IT JUST TO REACH THERE 
WHAT ALL FOUR OF US 
YEAH MAYBE 
RIGHT PASS IT TO 
NO YEAH WHATEVER 
WE WENT FROM THAT ONE REMEMBER 
YEAH 
THAT'S WELL DONE KEEP GOING 
SEE IF THAT'S STEADY 
IT'S STEADY O. K. GO 
THIS ONE'S GOT LOTS OF SPACE GO FOR THE EXIT NOW 
DON'T FORGET GET THAT 
GET THAT QUICK TO ME 
NOW WALK ACROSS THIS ONE 
RIGHT STOP THERE 
OH THAT'S WOBBLY THAT IS WOBBLY BY THE WAY DO YOU THINK 
WE SHOULD GO FOR THAT ONE NO WE DON'T HAVE TIME 
GO 
YEAH 
WARRIORS MOVE QUICKLY RUN 
THE WARRIORS ARE SAFE 
THE DEMONS ARE GONE 
BUT THEY WILL RETURN 
TAKE MORE TENSION 
STEP STEP 
YEADA TAYLAN SAMRA AND KARJA ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME 
THEY MUST WORK QUICKLY 
SAMRA PULL PULL 
KEEP PULLING EVERYBODY ELSE 
GIVE HIM SOME SLACK 
YOU CAN DO IT 
JUST PULL TAKE IT OFF 
ENCHANTED DEMONS WAS REALLY SCARY WITH THE CHANTING MAN 
BUT I MANAGED TO HOOK THE JEWELS FAST AND PULLED THEM TO MYSELF 
ONLY TIBOR AND LYMEL REMAIN WITHOUT A JEWEL WITH WHICH TO ESCAPE 
CAN THEIR SPEED SAVE THEM 
OH 
WOLVES YOU NOW HAVE A DIFFICULT CHOICE 
TIBOR IS LOST TO THE KEEPER OF THE GATE 
BUT SATYARANI HAS DECREED 
THAT YOU MAY USE EIGHT PRECIOUS JEWELS TO BUY HIM BACK 
YOU MUST DECIDE 
TO KEEP THE JEWELS OR BE REUNITED WITH YOUR LOST COMRADE 
RIGHT WE NEED TO DO A VOTE 
WHO WANTS TO KEEP TIBOR SHOULD HE HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE 
YEAH I GUESS SO I THINK HE STARTED TO PANIC WHEN WE WERE ALL GONE 
WHAT IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN LET'S VOTE WHO WANTS TO SEND HIM HOME 
O. K. SORRY THAT'S O. K. 
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE JEWELS SO BE IT 
I DECIDED TO SEND TIBOR HOME 
BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK WE'D HAVE ENOUGH JEWELS LEFT IF WE KEPT HIM 
AND ALSO I THINK HE STRUGGLED IN THE FIRST TWO CHALLENGES 
AND HE'D NEED ENCOURAGEMENT WHEN WE WEREN'T THERE 
IT WAS A HARD DECISION THERE WERE LOTS OF POINTS WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT 
BUT WE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION 
IT ISN'T FAIR BECAUSE I WANTED TIBOR IN BUT OUR LEADER 
AND LYMEL DECIDED 
THE PANTHERS AND EAGLES SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THEIR CHALLENGES THIS DAY 
NOW BOTH TEAMS HAVE THIRTEEN GEMS IN THEIR POSSESSION 
THE WOLVES HAVE THIRTEEN BUT ELECTED NOT TO BRING BACK THEIR COMRADE TIBOR 
SO NOW ONLY THREE MARCH UNDER THAT BANNER 
THE TIGERS SURVIVED THEIR TEST OF COURAGE BUT ONLY AT THE SACRIFICE 
OF EIGHT OF THEIR JEWELS 
THE FATE OF HADAV WAS DECIDED BY HIS COMRADES ON THE ROLL OF A DICE 
NOW THE TEAM IS COMPLETE ONCE MORE 
BUT THEIR TALLY REMAINS A MEAGRE FIVE 
NEBRA YOU ALONE DISAGREED WITH THE DECISION NOT TO BRING BACK TIBOR 
WHY DID YOU FEEL IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRING HIM BACK 
I THINK HE DID NEED A SECOND CHANCE 
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE BETTER TO PLAY WITH ALL OUR TEAM MEMBERS 
DESOT I DO THINK THAT MAYBE HE DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY I WASN'T SURE AT THE TIME HOW MANY JEWELS WE'D HAVE 
AND HOW THAT WOULD AFFECT THE TEAM 
LYMEL DID YOU NOT THINK HE DESERVED A SECOND CHANCE 
I THOUGHT HE'D START PANICKING IF HE WAS ON HIS OWN AGAIN 
SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WASTED JEWELS 
MARCA HADAV WAS BROUGHT BACK AFTER THE PILLARS OF COURAGE 
YOU USED A DICE TO MAKE THAT DECISION WHY 
BECAUSE I KNEW WE NEEDED JEWELS 
AND I KNEW WE ALSO NEEDED WARRIORS 
WE'RE EARLY ON IN THE QUEST SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAS MORE IMPORTANT 
SO THE DICE HELPED ME UNTIL I GET INTO THE ROLE OF BEING A LEADER 
AND KNOW WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT 
HADAV HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU KNEW THE DECISION WAS BEING MADE 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN 
BUT THEN I FELT VERY RELIEVED WHEN I KNEW I WAS COMING BACK 
SOHAR YOU REFUSED TO TAKE YOUR TURN WHEN YOU SAW HADAV FALL 
I WAS QUITE CONFIDENT TO START WITH BUT THEN I SAW HIM FALL 
AND I WAS JUST SO SCARED AND CONFUSED 
BUT LUCKILY JENRO DECIDED TO TAKE MY PLACE 
TODAY WAS THE MOMENT NEVAR MADE HIS FIRST MOVE 
HE'LL BE ANGRY NOT TO HAVE CAUSED MORE HAVOC AMONGST THE WARRIORS 
BUT WE MUST BE CAREFUL FOR THERE ARE MORE CHALLENGES TO FACE 
BEFORE THE SECRETS OF THE SERPENT'S TEMPLE ARE REVEALED 
LET'S HOPE THE WARRIORS REST WELL TONIGHT FOR WITH THE MORNING SUN 
THEY WILL ENCOUNTER MORE CHALLENGES ON THIS ARDUOUS QUEST 
NEXT TIME ON RAVEN 
THE SECRET TEMPLE 
THE TIGERS MUST FACE FIELD OF THE DEAD 
KNOWING THEY MUST GAIN MORE JEWELS 
WILL THE EAGLES SURVIVE THE SEARING HEAT AT OBELISKS OF THE SUN 
CAN THE WOLVES DEFEAT WATERS OF TIME WITHOUT TIBOR 
AND WILL RANGOLI RING CONFUSE THE PANTHERS 
NEVAR'S DEMONS ARE GETTING BRAVER 
I MUST STOP THOSE FIENDS FOR GOOD
