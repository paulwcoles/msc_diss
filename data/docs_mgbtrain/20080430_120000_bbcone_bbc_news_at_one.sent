TIME IN TWELVE YEARS 
A FLYING VISIT PRINCE WILLIAM

THE LATEST WEAPON CATCHING PARENTS 
OUT AT THE SCHOOL GATE 
GOOD AFTERNOON 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS ADMITTED 
MISTAKES IN ABOLISHING THE TEN P. TAX 
RATE IN A B. B. C. INTERVIEW HE 
CONCEDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD 
NOT DONE ENOUGH TO PROTECT SOME 
LOW PAID WORKERS AND PENSIONERS WHO 
WOULD LOSE OUT FROM THE CHANGE IN 
THE COMMONS THIS LUNCH TIME THE 
PRIME MINISTER AND DAVID CAMERON 
WERE INVOLVED IN HEATED EXCHANGES 
ON THE EVE OF THE LOCAL ELECTIONS 
ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS TO 
EXTEND DETENTION WITHOUT CHARGE TO 
FORTY TWO DAYS 
MR. BROWN BRANDED THE TORY LEADER A 
SHALLOW SALESMAN AND SAID HE SHOULD 
BE ASHAMED OF HIS OPPOSITION TO THE 
MOVE MR. CAMERON PREDICTED ANOTHER 
GOVERNMENT CLIMB DOWN OUR 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT GARY 
O'DONOGHUE REPORTS 
IT'S NOT OFTEN GORDON BROWN 
ACKNOWLEDGES HE HAS GOT SOMETHING 
WRONG TODAY HE LET GO AND 
ADMITTED THE REMOVAL OF THE TEN P. TAX 
BANDS HAD CAUSED PROBLEMS 
I'D BE 
HONEST ABOUT WE MADE TWO MISTAKES 
WE DIDN'T COVER THAT GROUP OF LOW 
PAID WORKERS AND LOW PAID LOW 
INCOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET THE 
WORKING TAX CREDIT WE WERE NOT 
ABLE TO HELP THE SIXTY TO SIXTY FOUR YEAR 
OLD ED 
A THANK ADMISSION OF OLDED MISTAKES WAS SEIZED UPON BY THE 
CONSERVATIVES AS PRIME MINISTER'S 
QUESTION TIME DAVID CAMERON 
SUGGESTING THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
SHOULD ALSO THINK AGAIN OVER PLANS 
TO EXTENDS DETENTION WITHOUT CHARGE 
TO FORTY TWO DAYS 
ISN'T IT THE TRUTH OF THE FORTY TWO DAYS 
EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FIASCO OF 
THE TEN P. TAX RATE THE REASON HE IS 
PUSHING THIS IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S 
RIGHT BUT BECAUSE IT'S PART OF A 
POLITICAL CALCULATION 
RIGHT BUT BECAUSE IT'S PART OF A POLITICAL CALCULATION 
POLITICAL CALCULATION IN ANGRY EXCHANGES GORDON BROWN 
INSISTED THAT THE FORTY TWO DAY PLAN WOULD 
GO AHEAD AND URGED THE 
CONSERVATIVES AND THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS TO SUPPORT IT 
THIS IS 
THE MAN WHO WANTS TO BE BOTH TOUGH 
ON CRIME AND HUG A HOODIE AT THE 
SAME TIME 
THIS IS THE MAN WHO CYCLED TO WORK 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE HAD THE 
CHAUFFEURED DRIVEN CAR COMING 
BEHIND THIS IS A THE MAN WHO IS A 
SHALLOW SALESMAN AND NECESSARY 
NEVER ADDRESSES THE SUBSTANCE OF 
THE ISSUE 
THE LIB DEM LEADER RETURNED TO THE 
QUESTION OF LOW EARNERS AND SAID IT 
WAS OBVIOUS WHY NONE OF THEM WOULD 
SUPPORT THE CONSERVATIVES IN 
TOMORROW'S LOCAL ELECTIONS AFTER AFTER DOUBLING THE TAX RATE FOR THE POOR 
AFTER LEAVING MORE THAN FORTY FIVE MILLION 
PEOPLE IN FUEL POVERTY AFTER 
CLOSING THOUSANDS OF POST OFFICES 
CAN HE EXPLAIN CAN HE EXPLAIN WHY 
ANY LOW EARNER SHOULD NOW SUPPORT 
HIS GOVERNMENT 
ALL OF THE PARTIES ARE HOLDING 
THEIR BREATH AHEAD OF TOMORROW'S 
ELECTIONS WHATEVER THEIR OUTCOME 
THERE ARE STILL SOME KEY 
PARLIAMENTARY BATTLES AHEAD 
LET'S GET MORE FROM OUR POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE IN 
TERMS OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE WHAT 
SENSE DO YOU GET OF PEOPLE THINK IT 
WAS RIGHT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER TO 
EVENTUALLY ADMIT A MISTAKE HERE 
I THINK POLITICALLY HIS M. P.'S ARE 
VERY GLAD HE IS ADOPTING THIS NEW 
LANGUAGE OF CONTRITION AND 
ACCEPTING A MISTAKE WAS MADE ONE 
OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY HAD FOUND 
ON THE DOORSTEP WHEN IT WAS RAIDSED 
BY THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND VOTERS 
WAS THIS IDEA THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
SIMPLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE 
PROBLEM THAT THIS BELIEF THAT 
GORDON BROWN DIDN'T ACCEPT THAT 
THERE WAS A PROBLEM SINCE THEN 
GORDON BROWN HAS STARTED ANNOUNCING 
THERE WILL BE MORE COMPENSATION FOR 
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN MOST HIT BY 
THIS AND COMING UP WITH THE 
LANGUAGE OF SAYING THAT WE ADMIT 
MISTAKES WERE MADE SIMPLY BECAUSE 
HE HAD TO 
MORE PROBLEMS AHEAD 
THOUGH CLEARLY WITH THE ISSUE OF 
THE FORTY TWO DAY LIMIT AS WELL 
YEAH THE 
CONSERVATIVES WILL PRESS HARD ON 
THIS BUT EQUALLY YOU HEARD FROM 
THE PRIME MINISTER TODAY A ROBUST 
POSITION THIS WILL GO TO THE VOTE 
IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THE REASON 
IS THIS GORDON BROWN HAS A 
REPUTATION NOW AT LEAST IN SOME 
SECTIONS OF THE BODY POLITIC HERE 
AT WESTMINSTER THAT HE IS BEING 
PUSHED AROUND BY HIS M. P.'S OVER THE 
TEN PENCE TAX RATE HE WILL BE 
DETERMINED NOT TO GIVE IN TO HIS 
BACKBENCHERS WHEN TO COMES TO A 
VOTE IN JUNE WHAT WE WILL SEE IS 
GREATER GOVERNMENT DETERMINATION TO 
PUSH AHEAD WITH THIS BUT AT THE 
SAME TIME DISCRETIONS DISCREETLY 
SHOVED OUT AT THE CONSULTATION 
STAGE STAGE THE COMPETITION COMMISSION HAS 
PUBLISHED ITS FINAL REPORT ON THE 
GROCERY MARKET AFTER A TWO YEAR 
LONG INVESTIGATION IT'S FOUND THAT 
ON THE WHOLE THE BIG SUPERMARKET 
CHAINS OFFER CUSTOMERS A GOOD DEAL 
IT DID SAY ACTION IS NEEDED TO 
IMPROVE COMPETITION IN SOME TOWNS 
THERE'S TO BE A STRICTER CODE OF 
CONDUCT TO PROTECT SUPPLIERS OUR 
BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT HUGH PYM 
REPORTS REPORTS THEY PLAY A BIG PART IN OUR LIVES 
SEVENTY FIVE PENCE OF EVERY POUND WE SPEND ON 
GROCERIES GOES TO THE BIG FOUR 
SUPERMARKET CHAINS THEIR TOTAL 
ANNUAL SALES OF EIGHTY THREE BILLION IS THE 
EQUIVALENT TO THE NATION SPENDING 
ON EDUCATION SO ARE THEY TOO 
POWERFUL ANOTHER INQUIRY HAS TAKEN 
A LOOK 
IT'S TAKEN TWO YEARS TO COME UP 
WITH THIS REPORT THERE WERE SEVEN HUNDRED 
SUBMISSIONS FROM DIFFERENT PARTIES 
INCLUDING GROUPS LIKE THESE OUTSIDE 
THE COMPETITION COMMISSION THIS 
MORNING CAMPAIGNING FOR THE RIGHTS 
OF WORKERS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
WHO SUPPLY SUPERMARKETS SO WHAT 
ARE THE PROPOSALS LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES SHOULD HAVE MORE SCOPE 
TO CHOOSE WHICH SUPERMARKETS SHOULD 
GET PLANNING PERMISSION THERE 
SHOULD BE BEEFED UP CODE OF 
PRACTICE FOR SUPPLIERS POLICED BY 
AN OMBUDSMAN 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 
AREAS OF CONCERN ONE IS A TENDENCY 
TO BUILD UP POSITIONS OF MARKET 
POWER IN LOCAL AREAS AND THE OTHER 
IS IN RELATION TO THE TREATMENT OF 
SUPPLIERS WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD 
MEASURES TO DEAL WITH BOTH OF THOSE 
IT'S ALL COME TOO LATE FOR WILLIAM 
HUDSON HE STOPPED SUPPLYING 
STRAWBERRIES TO SUPERMARKETS 
BECAUSE THEY HAD PUSHED DOWN PRICES 
SO MUCH AND HE COULDN'T MAKE ENDS 
MEET HE THINKS THE NEW WATCHDOG 
WOULD INSIST ON FAIRER DEAL FOR SUPPLIERS SUPPLIERS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF TEETH 
THAT OMBUDSMAN MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE 
BUT THE FACT WE HAVE A PROPER 
METHOD OF DISCUSSING TAKING TO 
PIECES AND INDEED TRANSPARENCY FOR 
THESE PROBLEMS I THINK IS 
SOMETHING THAT THE WHOLE INDUSTRY 
WILL WELCOME 
ONE RETAIL SPOKESMAN SAID THE 
REPORT PANDERED TO SUPPLIER 
PRESSURE GROUPS THOUGH 
SUPERMARKETS WELCOMED ITS 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT SHOPPERS DO 
GET A FAIR DEAL THEY'RE NOW BRACED 
FOR YET ANOTHER INQUIRY WITH THE 
OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING LOOKING AT 
ALLEGATIONS OF PRICE FIXING 
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT 
HOW THAT REPORT WILL AFFECT 
SUPPLIERS NICK RAVENSCROFT IS ON 
DAIRY FARM IN CHESHIRE 
THIS DAIRY FARM HAS THREE HUNDRED COWS HERE 
IN THE HEART OF CHESHIRE'S 
COUNTRYSIDE AND THE COMPLAINT FROM 
THE FARMERS HERE IN THIS AREA FROM 
MANY OF THEM IS THAT THE 
SUPERMARKETS HAVE CONSIDERABLE 
FINANCIAL MUSCLE THAT THEY DRIVE 
DOWN PRICES SO FAR THAT THE FARMERS 
CAN'T MAKE DECENT PROFIT RAY 
HERE HAS BEEN FARMING AROUND HERE 
ALL OF HIS LIFE HAVE THE 
SUPERMARKETS REALLY MADE THAT MUCH 
OF A DIFFERENCE TO YOUR PRICES YOU 
GET 
OH YEAH THEY CERTAINLY HAVE GET IF YOU TAKE ELEVEN YEARS AGO WE 
WERE RECEIVING TWENTY SIX P. A LITRE FOR MILK 
TODAY WE ARE RECEIVING TWENTY SIX P. A LITRE 
FOR THE MILK THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED 
IN ELEVEN YEARS OUR COSTS HAVE 
ROCKETED SO MUCH THE FOOD THE 
FERTILISER THE FERTILISER FOR 
INSTANCE HAS GONE FROM NINETY A TONNE 
TO THREE HUNDRED A TONNE DURING THAT PERIOD 
YOU TALK ABOUT THE SUPERMARKETS AND 
THE EFFECT THEY'VE HAD THE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION HAS COME UP 
WITH THE IDEA OF THIS OMBUDSMAN 
GOOD THING 
IT'S A GOOD THING IF 
IT'S GOT TEETH IT'S GOING TO HAVE 
TO WORK IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO 
AN AWFUL LOT BETTER THAN THE OFFICE 
OF FAIR TRADING HAVE DONE UP TO NOW 
THE REASON THAT FARMERS DON'T LIKE 
SUPERMARKETS IS BECAUSE THEY DRIVE 
DOWN THE FARMERS' PRICES BUT THAT 
IS THE REASON THAT CUSTOMERS LIKE 
THE SUPERMARKETS 
IT DOESN'T WORK 
THAT WELL IF YOU TAKE THE SAME 
SCENARIO OUR PRICE SAY STAYING THE 
SAME FOR ELEVEN YEARS IF YOU LOOK 
BACK ELEVEN YEARS THE CONSUMER 
PAID FORTY P. A LITRE NOW THEY'RE 
PAYING FIFTY NINE P. A LITRE FOR THAT SAME 
MILK OUR PRICES HAVE BEEN THE SAME 
AND THE SUPERMARKETS OR THE 
SHAREHOLDERS OF THE SUPERMARKETS 
HAVE TAKEN A BIG CHUNK OUT OF THAT 
THEY'RE BEING RIPPED OFF IN OTHER 
WORDS 
RAY MENTIONED THE FEAR THAT WORDS THIS OMBUDSMAN WOULD NOT HAVE TEETH 
THE COMPETITION COMMISSION SAYS IT 
WILL HAVE TEETH AND IF SUPERMARKETS 
FAIL TO COMPLY WITH ITS RULINGS AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS THERE COULD BE 
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL PENALTIES IT 
SAYS SAYS NOW THERE IS MORE EVIDENCE OF A 
DOWNTURN IN THE HOUSING MARKET 
FIGURES FROM THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST 
BUILDING SOCIETY THE NATIONWIDE 
SHOW HOUSE PRICES IN THE U. K. HAVE 
RECORDED THEIR FIRST ANNUAL FALL 
FOR TWELVE YEARS THE AVERAGE HOUSE NOW 
COSTS ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LESS THAN A YEAR AGO 
OUR PERSONAL FINANCE CORRESPONDENT 
RICHARD SCOTT IS HERE WITH ALL OF 
THE DETAILS 
WE'RE 
WE'RE 
THE AVERAGE PROPERTY PRICE HAS 
FALLEN BY TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED A MONTH FALLING 
PRICES OVER A WHOLE YEAR IS 
SOMETHING WE HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE 
NINETEEN NINETY SIX WE'VE BEEN TO BIRMINGHAM TO 
VISIT ONE SELLER TRYING TO COPE 
WITH THE FALLING MARKET 
DEE SMITH IS STRUGGLING TO SELL 
SHE PUT HER THREE BED SEMI ON TO 
THE MARKET TWO YEARS AGO BUT 
DESPITE CUTTING THE PRICE BY 
ELEVEN THOUSAND SHE'S HAD NO TAKERS WE WE HAVE LOWERED THE PRICE FOUR TIMES 
NOW WE HAVE PAINTED IT TWICE AS 
WELL THE BUYERS ARE OUT THERE BUT 
WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT WE'VE HAD A 
COUPLE OF PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET 
MORTGAGES THAT HAVE PUT IN OFFERS 
WHICH THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS O. K. 
WE'VE HAD SOME PEOPLE THAT HAVE PUT 
IN STUPID OFFERS 
ACROSS THE 
MIDLANDS IN NOTTINGHAM IT'S A 
SIMILAR STORY THERE ARE BUYERS 
AROUND BUT THE CREDIT CRUNCH MAKES 
IT HARDER TO GET A MORTGAGE SO 
THEY WANT A BARGAIN 
TO GET THE 
MARKET MOVING THERE HAS TO BE 
ACCESS TO FINANCE FOR BUYERS THE 
BUYER WILL IS THERE WE HAVE THE 
SAME LEVEL OF BUYERS LOOKING AT 
PROPERTY THIS YEAR AS WE HAD LAST 
YEAR BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT MORE 
HOUSES BEFORE THEY ARE COMMITTING 
THEY'RE VERY NERVOUS ABOUT 
COMMITTING 
AND THE BUILDING COMMITTING SOCIETY BEHIND TODAY'S REPORT 
THINKS THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE MORE 
FALLS ON THE WAY 
WE DO EXPECT THAT 
PRICES WILL END UP HAD LOWER THAN 
THEY ARE NOW AT THE END OF THE YEAR 
WE ARE NOT MAKING ANY COMPARISONS 
BETWEEN TODAY'S MARKET AND THE 
CRASH THE NINETIES ANY COMPARISONS 
ON THAT LEVEL ARE OVERBLOWN WE ARE 
IN DIFFERENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
ONE MEMBER OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S 
MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE SAID LAST 
NIGHT THAT HOUSE PRICES COULD FALL 
BY AROUND A THIRD OVER THE NEXT FEW 
YEARS THAT COULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR 
MOST PEOPLE AS ANYONE WANTING TO 
MOVE UP THE PROPERTY LADDER SHOULD 
BENEFIT BENEFIT LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS WITH OUR 
ECONOMICS EDITOR STEPHANIE FLANDERS 
THAT IS ONE OF THE POINTS HERE 
IT'S NOT ALL BAD NEWS WHEN HOUSE 
PRICES FALL 
WE FOCUS OFTEN THE 
DOOM AND GLOOM AND THERE ARE PEOPLE 
HAVING A HARD TIME THIS MODEST 
FALL COMPARES TO A NEARLY TREBLING 
OF HOUSE PRICES IN THE LAST TEN 
YEARS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE PRICES FALL FURTHER 
ACTUALY I WAS LOOKING AT THE 
FIGURES AND IT'S SURPRISING MORE 
THAN SIXTY PER CENT OF HOUSEHOLDS DON'T HAVE A 
MORTGAGE THEY OWN THEIR HOUSE 
OUTRIGHT OR THEY RENT THEY'RE NOT 
AS RISK FROM NEGATIVE EQUITY THERE 
ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WITH A 
MORTGAGE WHO WOULD LIKE PRICES FALL 
EVEN SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO LOSE ON 
PAPER THEY MAY HAVE TO GIVE LESS 
TO THEIR KIDS TO HELP THEM ON TO 
THE PROPERTY LADDER A LOT OF 
PEOPLE DO WORRY ABOUT THAT IF 
PRICES CONTINUE TO FALL THEN 
THINGS WILL BE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR 
THEM IF MORTGAGE RATES DON'T KEEP 
GOING UP 
INDEED L. SUPPOSE THE 
PROBLEMS DON'T REALLY GO AWAY FOR 
FIRST TIME BUYERS 
NO RIGHT NOW 
IF YOU ARE A FIRST TIME BUYER 
THINGS ARE NOT LOOKING VERY 
AFFORDABLE IF YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH 
OF A DEPOSIT THERE ARE NO CHEAP 
MORTGAGE DEALS OUT THERE FOR YOU 
IF YOU CAN WAIT IF YOU CAN START 
SAVING AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF 
BANKS ARE DESPERATE FOR YOUR CASH 
THERE ARE GOOD SAVINGS RATES OUT 
THERE MAYBE IN A YEAR OR SO YOU 
MIGHT HAVE A BIGGER DEPOSIT AND 
MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUY A CHEAPER 
HOUSE HOUSE THANK YOU 
PRINCE WILLIAM HAS MADE A FLYING 
VISIT TO AFGHANISTAN TO MEET 
BRITISH TROOPS BASED THERE HE FLEW 
INTO KANDAHAR AIRPORT AND FOR 
TIME WAS AT THE CONTROLS OF THE 
PLANE JON BRAIN REPORTS 
ANOTHER ROYAL IN THE WAR ZONE 
THESE PICTURES RELEASED FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN MORNING SHOW PRINCE 
WILLIAM AT KANDAHAR AIRFIELD ON 
MONDAY THE SECOND IN LINE TO THE 
THRONE SPENT THREE HOURS ON THE 
GROUND MEETING BRITISH TROOPS 
THE SECRET TRIP BEGAN THE DAY 
BEFORE WHEN WILLIAM LEFT R. A. F. BRIZE 
NORTON ON A MILITARY TRANSPORT 
PLANE THE PRINCE PILOTED THE 
AIRCRAFT FOR PART OF THE JOURNEY 
ON THE RETURN LEG THE PLANE 
CARRIED THE BODY OF TROOPER ROBERT 
PEARSON THE TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD WAS KILLED 
WHEN HIS ARMOURED VEHICLE HIT A 
MINE MINE PRINCE WILLIAM WHO RECEIVED HIS 
PILOT'S WINGS LAST MONTH IS 
CURRENTLY ON ATTACHMENT TO THE R. A. F. 
HIS VISIT TO AFGHANISTAN IS BEING 
DESCRIBED AS A FAMILIARISATION 
EXERCISE BUT IT FOLLOWS A SERIES 
OF EMBARRASSING HEADLINES ABOUT THE 
PRINCE'S PRIVATE USE OF R. A. F. 
HELICOPTERS SOME SAY THAT THE 
TIMING OF THE TRIP IS NO 
COINCIDENCE COINCIDENCE I'M NOT SUGGESTING FOR ONE MOMENT 
THAT THE TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN 
DON'T DESERVE A BOOST OF MORALE O. A 
MORALE BOOST BUT I THINK THIS IS A 
P. R. RECOVERY EXERCISE STAGED IN THE 
MAIN BY CLARENCE HOUSE 
THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT WAS ALWAYS IN THE 
PIPELINE IF THEY COULD DO IT THEY 
WOULD DO IT IT DOES COME AFTER THE 
SLAP ON THE WRIST WITH THE 
HELICOPTER THE CYNICS WILL SAY 
IT'S P. R. I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS 
INDEED WILLIAM HAS SPOKEN OF HIS 
DESIRE TO FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS 
OF HIS YOUNGER BROTHER HARRY WHO 
RECENTLY SPENT TEN WEEKS ON ACTIVE 
SERVICE IN HELMAND PROVINCE BUT 
WHATEVER THE MOTIVES BEHIND HIS 
VISIT TO AFGHANISTAN HE KNOWS HIS 
SENIORTY MEANS IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY 
HE WILL EVER EXPERIENCE REAL COMBAT 
HIMSELF 
THE TOP STORY THE PRIME MINISTER 
HAS ADMITTED MISTAKES WERE MADE 
OVER THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN PENCE 
TAX RATE COMING UP AFTER 
MANCHESTER UNITED WON THEIR TICKET 
TO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL IN 
FIND OUT HOW MANY OF 
THE FANS WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE THE 
TRIP LATER WHY THESE COULD BE THE 
ANSWER TO LONDON'S CONGESTION AND 
CAN CHELSEA BE THE OTHER HALF OF 
THE ALL ENGLISH CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE 
FINAL 
HALF OF ALL EASTERN EUROPEAN 
MIGRANTS WHO HAVE COME HERE SINCE 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR HAVE ALREADY RETURNED HOME 
THE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY 
RESEARCH ALSO CLAIMS THAT ONE 
MILLION EMIGRATED TO THE U. K. IN THE 
THE LAST FOUR YEARS FROM EASTERN 
EUROPE THAT FIGURE IS ABOUT TEN 
TIMES THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATE WE 
HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT ALL THE 
FIGURES NICK IS HERE WITH THE 
FIGURES THERE ARE TWO VIEWS THERE 
IS THE GLASS HALF EMPTY VIEW AND 
HALF FULL VIEW AND IN THIS CASE 
PERHAPS THE GLASS HOLDS POLISH BEER 
FOUR YEARS AGO YOU COULD HARDLY BUY 
THE STUFF IN BRITAIN LAST YEAR THE 
TWO LEADING BRANDS SOLD FORTY FOUR MILLION 
PINTS THAT IS ONE MEASURE OF HOW 
MANY PEOPLE FROM EASTERN EUROPE ARE 
LIVING IN BRITAIN THE IPPR RECKONS 
THE NUMBER HAS GONE UP FROM ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND 
TO OF SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND AND THE LION'S SHARE 
COMES FROM POLAND IS THAT A BAD 
THING OR GOOD THE IPPR IS UPBEAT 
THEY ARE YOUNG AND MOSTLY IN THEIR 
TWENTIES AND THIRTIES MOST ARE IN JOBS MANY 
MORE IN FACT THAN THE U. K. AVERAGE 
LESS THAN ONE IN TEN HAVE DEPENDENT 
CHILDREN THEY WORK LONGER HOURS 
FOR LESS MONEY IN JOBS THAT U. K. 
BORN WORKERS OFTEN WON'T DO LIKE 
THE COCKLE PICKERS HERE AND THEY 
DON'T STAY AS WE REPORTED LAST 
NIGHT THERE WERE AROUND ONE 
MILLION MIGRANTS ARRIVING SINCE 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND AROUND HALF HAVE ALREADY 
GONE HOME WHAT DO THE YOUNG POLES 
THINK OF THEIR EXPERIENCE IF 
BRITAIN IN BRITAIN IT USED TO 
BE A CURRY HOUSE BUT DOROTA 
SKRYZPEK HAS TURNED IT INTO A 
POLISH WAREHOUSE THEY SAVED MONEY 
AND THEY OPENED RESTAURANT IN JANUARY 
I LOVE COOKING L. LOVE JANUARY NORTHAMPTON AND I THINK THAT I STAY 
HERE 
THOUSANDS OF POLES ARE HERE PUTTING DOWN ROOTS OPENING 
BUSINESSES STARTING FAMILIES BUT 
TODAY'S REPORT SHOWS A COMPLEX 
PICTURE OF MIGRATION IT SAYS THE 
NUMBERS COMING IS STARTING TO SLOW 
AND MANY POLES FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND HAVE 
ALREADY GONE HOME AT HAULAGE FOUND 
WE FOUND THIS LADY SHE WORKS IN 
THE OFFICE GIVING INSTRUCTIONS TO 
THE POLISH DRIVERS BUT SHE SAYS 
LIKE MANY OF HER FRIENDS SHE HAS 
NO INTENTION OF STAYING 
WHEN I 
SPEAK TO PEOPLE THEY DON'T LIKE TOO 
MUCH ENGLAND BECAUSE IT'S A 
FOREIGN COUNTRY 
THE FALLING NUMBER 
OF MIGRANTS IS A WORRY FOR LOCAL 
FIRMS 
WE FIND THAT SOME OF THE FIRMS BRITISH PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DO THE 
THE JOBS AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE 
POLISH PEOPLE WE WOULD FIND IT 
DIFFICULT TO FILL SOME OF THE JOBS 
PROBABLY 
THE IPPR THINKS THAT THE PROBABLY INFLUX MAY HAVE PEAKED AS 
COUNTRIES LIKE POLAND GET RICHER 
FEWER POLES ARE LIKELY TO COME TO 
BRITAIN THE GLASS HALF FULL 
RESPONSE TO THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
MAY NOT HAVE TO STRUGGLE MUCH 
LONGER WITH AN INFLUX OF POLISH 
CHILDREN IN THEIR SCHOOLS THE HALF 
EMPTY WE MAY HAVE TO LOOK ONCE 
AGAIN TO OTHER COUNTRIES OUTSIDE 
EUROPE FOR OUR POOL OF CHEAP LABOUR 
THERE IS A LOT MORE DETAIL AGAIN 
AND MORE OF A GEOGRAPHICAL 
BREAKDOWN OF ALL OF THIS REPORT ON 
THE NEWS WEBSITE 
THE BRITISH JOURNALIST WHO WAS HELD 
HOSTAGE IN IRAQ EARLIER THIS YEAR 
HAS BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT THE MOMENT 
HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE 
KILLED RICHARD BUTLER WAS 
KIDNAPPED IN BASRA WHILE WORKING 
FOR THE AMERICAN BROADCASTER C. B. S. 
AND HELD FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS 
SPEAKING IN HIS FIRST BRITISH 
INTERVIEW HE TOLD KATE SILVERTON 
ABOUT HIS ORDEAL RICHARD BUTLER 
AND HIS TRANSLATOR WERE TAKEN FROM 
THIS HOTEL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
NIGHT BY MEN WEARING BALACLAVAS AND 
POLICE UNIFORM THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN 
BY THE VERY MONEY SUPPOSED TO 
RESTORE ORDER IN IRAQ BUT HIS 
EXPERIENCE TAUGHT HIM OTHERWISE 
I'VE BEEN TAKEN BY BASRA POLICE AND 
WE ALL KNOW THAT BASRA POLICE ARE 
COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY STAFFED BY 
MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT MILITIAS 
KNEW IT WASN'T GOOD 
A CLAIM THE 
IRAQI DEFENCE MINISTRY DENIES 
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR FORCES THE POLICE WERE 
INVOLVED IN ANY WAY IN THE 
KIDNAPPING 
THE MINISTER CLAIMS THE KIDNAPPING MEN WERE JUST DRESSED AS POLICE 
OFFICERS A SUGGESTION I PUT TO 
RICHARD 
IF SO THE CAR I WAS TAKEN RICHARD AWAY IN WAS ALSO DRESSED AS A 
POLICE CAR AND THE BUILDING I WAS 
HELD IN WAS DRESSED AS A POLICE 
STATION 
RICHARD WAS KEPT ON THE STATION MOVE ASOME PLACES HE WAS TREATED 
WELL AT OTHERS HE FEARED HE WOULD 
BE EXECUTED 
THEY PLACED PLASTIC 
BAGS IN OUR MOUTHS AND TAPED OUR 
MOUTHS UP AND ALSO MOVED THE 
HANDCUFFS TO OUR BACK AND MOVED US 
AND MY TRANSLATOR ACTUALLY SAID TO 
ME THEY ARE GOING TO KILL US HIS HIS TRANSLATOR WAS LATER RELEASED 
UNHARMED RICHARD WOULD SPEND NINE 
WEEKS HOODED AND ALONE TO COPE HE 
SHUT OUT THOUGHTS OF HIS FAMILY 
SOMETHING HE NOW FEELS GUILTY ABOUT 
I MADE A DECISION TO SHUT THEM OUT 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND IF I 
STARTED TO DRIFT MY THOUGHTS IN 
THAT DIRECTION I WOULD ACTUALLY 
SAY TO MYSELF DON'T GO THERE IT 
WASN'T THE EASIEST THING BUT I HAD 
TO DO IT 
IT WAS IRAQI PS WHO 
FOUND RICHARD HE KNOWS HE WAS 
EXTREMELY LUCKY THEY HAD BEEN 
RAIDING HOUSES IN SEARCH OF ILLEGAL 
WEAPONS WHEN THEY CAME ACROSS HIM 
THE BULLETS WERE PING AGO CROSS THE 
WALL AND COMING BACK PAST US THERE 
SEEMED TO BE QUITE A LOT OF 
CONFUSION EXCEPT WITH THE THE 
SOLDIER THAT HAD ME HE KNEW 
EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING 
IT IS 
STILL UNCLEAR WHO WAS BEHIND HIS 
KIDNAP BUT EVEN AFTER ALL OF THIS 
RICHARD SAYS HE WANTS TO RETURN TO 
IRAQ 
IT'S WHAT I DO AND IT'S A IRAQ VERY IMPORTANT STORY AND THE 
MAJORITY OF IRAQI PEOPLE THAT I 
MEET AND WORK WITH ARE LOVELY 
PEOPLE AND THEY DESERVE BETTER 
RICHARD WAS LUCKY FIVE BRITISH 
HOSTAGES ARE STILL BEING HELD IN 
IRAQ 
THE GERMAN NEWSPAPER HAS OBTAINED 
MOVING PICTURES OF JOSEF FRITZL 
THE MAN WHO HAS ADMITTED 
IMPRISONING HIS DAUGHTER FOR TWENTY FOUR 
YEARS IN AUSTRALIA AUSTRIA THE 
PICTURES ARE OF HIM ON HOLIDAY IN 
THAILAND IT IS THOUGHT THAT WHILE 
HE WAS ABROAD HIS FATHER AND SOME 
OF THE CHILDREN REMAINED IN PRISON 
IN THE BASEMENT OF THEIR HOME IN 
THE AUSTRIAN TOWN OF AMSTETTEN OUR 
REPORTER HAS JUST SEEN THESE 
PICTURES WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 
ABOUT THESE 
THE MOVING PICTURES 
HAVE BEGUN COMING IN AND THE 
DETAILS ARE FAIRLY SKETCHY THEY 
WERE TAKEN AROUND THE NINETEEN NINETY ON WHAT 
IS BEING DESCRIBED IN THIS GERMAN 
NEWSPAPER AS A BOYS' HOLIDAY IT'S 
BELIEVED THAT THAT HOLIDAY IS A 
EUPHERMISIM FOR A SEX HOLIDAY IN 
THAILAND THERE YOU CAN SEE HIM IN 
THE COMPANY OF A WOMAN OTHER 
PICTURES SHOW HIM AGAIN SUNBATHING 
ON A BEACH WITH FRIENDS CLEARLY 
HAVING A GOOD TIME HE GOES ON TO 
HAVE DINNER AT VARIOUS RESTAURANTS 
SUPERFICIALLY ALL QUITE INNOCENT 
BUT LOOKING AT THE TIMING IT IS 
CLEAR THAT WHEN HE WENT AWAY HE 
ALREADY HAD HIS DAUGHTER AND HER 
TWO OF HER CHILDREN THAT HE HAD 
FATHERED LOCKED UP IN THAT CELLAR 
IN AUSTRIA WHICH OBVIOUSLY THROWS 
AN EVEN MORE SENSATIONAL LIGHT IF 
YOU LIKE ON WHAT IS TURNING OUT TO 
BE AN HORRIFIC STORY ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S TURN OUR 
ATTENTIONS TO SOME SPORTS NEWS 
BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY KNOW FOR THE 
FIRST TIME EVER TWO ENGLISH SIDES 
WILL CONTEST NEXT MONTH'S CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE FINAL MANCHESTER UNITED 
BOOKED THEIR PLACE IN MOSCOW LAST 
NIGHT AND TONIGHT CHELSEA OR 
LIVERPOOL CHELSEA AND LIVERPOOL 
ARE FIGHTING IT OUT FOR THAT TRIP 
TO RUSSIA BUT FANS' CELEBRATIONS 
MAY BE TEMPERED BY THE DIFFICULTY 
OF ACTUALLY GETTING THERE IN ONE 
MOMENT RUPERT WINGFIELD HAYES 
REPORTS ON THE RECEPTION THAT 
AWAITS THOSE WHO CAN BUT FIRST 
THIS REPORT FROM MANCHESTER 
THIS WAS THE FOURTEENTH MINUTE GOAL THAT 
MEANT THE WORLD TO UNITED'S FANS 
BUT IT MEANT THE START OF A COSTLY 
AND DIFFICULT CHALLENGE TO GET TO 
THE FINAL IN MOSCOW JUST MINUTES 
AFTER THE WHISTLE AGENTS WERE 
ALREADY LOOKING TO CASH IN BUT CAN 
THE FANS AFFORD IT 
FLY TO BELFAST 
AND THEN TO RUSSIA AND THEN BACK 
AGAIN SO IT'S ANOTHER COST ON TOP 
IT'S 
IF I COULD GO FOR 
ONE THOUSAND EACH WE WOULD GO BUT NOT 
MUCH MORE L. DON'T KNOW L. THINK IT 
WOULD BE TOO DEAR OTHERWISE I I WOULD CANCEL THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS 
THE WIFE WOULD HAVE TO STAY AT HOME 
SHE MIGHT NOT BE THE ONLY ONE 
HERE'S A ROUGH IDEA OF HOW MUCH THE 
FINAL WILL COST YOUR AVERAGE 
MANCHESTER UNITED LIVERPOOL OR 
CHELSEA SUPPORTER 
WHEN YOU ARE CHOSING YOUR FLIGHTS 
THE CLUB SAYS IF YOU USE A CHARTER 
ONE APPROVED BY THEM YOU ARE 
GUARANTEED AN EASIER VISA 
APPLICATION PROCESS WHAT HAPPENS 
IF AND WHEN YOU EVENTUALLY GET 
THERE IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE LUCKY 
ONES WHO GET A TICKET TO THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL AND YOU 
MANAGE TO FINAL REASONABLY PRICED 
TICKET TO MOSCOW AND YOU ALSO 
MANAGE TO GET THROUGH IMMIGRATION 
THEN YOU WILL END UP HERE BUT YOUR 
TROUBLES WILL NOT BE OVER AS YOU 
CAN SEE IT'S PRETTY CHAOTIC HERE 
THE TAXIES HERE ARE PRETTY 
UNREGULATED I'M GOING TO TRY TO 
SEE IF THIS GUY WILL TAKE ME TO THE 
CITY DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH LITTLE 
I WOULD LIKE TO GO MONTH MOSCOW TO 
THE COSMOS HOTEL HOW MUCH THREE THREE THREE THOUSAND WHAT IS THAT IT'S ABOUT SIXTY 
QUID TO GO FROM HERE TO THE CITY 
THINK I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT BUT 
TAKE THE TRAIN INSTEAD THANK YOU 
THE TRAIN MAY BE OLD AND CROWDED 
BUT IT'S QUICK AND IT'S DIRT CHEAP 
THIS COST ME ONE HUNDRED FIFTY WHICH IS JUST THREE 
A LOT BETTER THAN SIXTY MANY MOSCOW 
SUCH BARGAINS ARE RARE AT THIS 
SOVIET ERA MONSTER IN THE MOSCOW 
SUBURBS ROOM ARE ONE HUNDRED A NIGHT IN 
THE CITY CENTRE THEY ARE MORE LIKE 
FIVE HUNDRED IF THERE IS ANYTHING MONEY 
LEFT AFTER THAT BE PREPARED TO PAY 
FOUR FOR A PINT OF BEER LITTLE 
WONDER MOSCOW HAS NOW OVERTAKEN 
LONDON AS THE MOST EXPENSIVE CITY 
IN THE WORLD 
WELL LET'S LOOK AT THE WEATHER NOW 
HELLO 
WE'VE HAD REALLY HEAVY RAIN WE ARE 
STILL LOOKING OUT FOR MORE HEAVY 
RAIN TO COME THROUGH THE AFTERNOON 
SO KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE AREAS 
OF CLOUD THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING 
NORTHWARDS INTENSE RAIN ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN PARTS AND VERY UNDER THIS 
WHITE CLOUD HERE ACROSS THE SOUTH 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON STILL A RISK 
OF HEAVY SHOWERS WE ARE LOOKING AT 
THUNDER AND MAYBE HAIL PRETTY 
PERSISTENT SHOWERS TO WATCH OUT FOR 
ACROSS MANY PARTS OF CENTRAL AND 
EASTERN ENGLAND IN THE NORTH 
BRIGHTER SPELLS MAY POP OUT THE 
RAIN BAND WORKING WESTWARDS ACROSS 
SCOTLAND SOME BRIGHTNESS A RISK 
OF SHOWERS AND THE RAIN BAND DRAPED 
AROUND NORTHERN AND WESTERN COASTS 
OF SCOTLAND JUST CLIPPING INTO 
EASTERN PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
MORE OF POTENTIAL IN ANTRIM AND 
DOWN THE RAIN BAND WILL DRIPS DOWN 
INTO DEVON AND CORNWALL STILL SOME 
RAIN AROUND BUT THE MORE INTENSE 
DOWNPOURS WILL BE ON THE MAIN BAND 
OR ACROSS THE SHOWERS THE SHOWERS 
THAT WE HAVE AROUND WILL TEND TO 
FADE LITTLE BIT ACROSS THE SOUTH 
AS WE HEAD THROUGH THE EVENING IF 
YOU ARE WATCHING THE FOOTBALL 
SHOWERS INITIALLY AND LATER ON 
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL DIE AWAY 
FURTHER NORTH ACROSS THE U. K. WE 
STILL HAVE SOME RAIN AROUND BUT 
GENERALLY SPEAKING NOT QUITE AS

FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
FOR ENGLAND AND WALES IT WILL BE 
AN AFTERNOON FEATURE PRETTY HEF 
THUNDERY DOWNPOURS TO CONTEND WITH
