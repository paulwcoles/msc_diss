HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW 
WITH ADRIAN CHILES 
AND CHRISTINE 
BLEAKLEY WE HAVE THE FIRST LADY OF 
FOOTBALL IN OUR MIDST NANCY 
DELL'OLIO LOVELY TO HAVE YOU HERE 
WE HAVE LUCY SIEGLE AND OUR SCIENCE 
MAN MICHAEL MOSLEY 
LUCY IS HERE 
TODAY HELP US COMMEMORATE A 
PARTICULARLY SAD ANNIVERSARY 
IT IS 
FIFTEEN YEARS TOMORROW SINCE STEPHEN 
LAWRENCE WAS MURDERED IN SOUTH EAST 
LONDON BY A RACIST GANG HIS HIS KILLERS STILL HAVEN'T BEEN CAUGHT 
ELTHAM IN SOUTH LONDON PEOPLE HERE 
ARE GETTING ON WITH THEIR LIVES 
GOING TO WORK AND MEETING WITH 
FRIENDS SADLY IT'S BECOME 
SYNONYMOUS WITH THE MURDER OF 
STEPHEN LAWRENCE WHO DIED IN THE 
STREET BEHIND ME FIFTEEN YEARS AGO 
STEPHEN LAWRENCE WAS STABBED TO 
DEATH 
THE MURDER WAS RACIALLY DEATH MOTIVATED AND THE POLICE HAVE MADE 
NO ARRESTS SO FAR 
HIS DEATH 
BROUGHT MAJOR CHANGES TO THE LAW 
AND A LANDMARK REPORT BRANDED THE 
POLICE INSTITUTIONALLY RACIST NO 
ONE HAS EVER BEEN CONVICTED OF 
STEPHEN'S MURDER WITH NO 
RESOLUTION THE LOCALS HAVE HAD TO 
COME TO TERMS WITH THE TRAGEDY 
THEMSELVES ON THE NIGHT OF THE 
ATTACK THIS OFF DUTY POLICEMAN WAS 
DRIVING HOME 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN 
AROUND ELEVEN HUNDRED ISH AND THE FIRST 
THING I NOTICED WAS SOMEONE WAS 
WALKING IN FRONT OF THE CARS IN THE 
ROAD MY WIFE SAID YOU NEED TO 
STOP THERE IS SOMEONE ON THE 
PAVEMENT WE SAW WHAT TURNED OUT 
TO BE STEPHEN ON THE GROUND CAN CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR 
HEAD 
MY POLICE TRAINING KICKED IN HEAD BECAUSE I THOUGHT I NEED TO GET 
SOME EVIDENCE HERE I NEED TO GET 
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WRITE DOWN 
LATER THAT WE CAN USE IN SOME 
FUTURE TRIAL 
AT WHAT POINT DID YOU 
BECOME AWARE THAT HE HAD BEEN 
STABBED 
ONLY WHEN THE AMBULANCE STABBED MEN CAME AND LIFTED HIM ON TO THE 
STRETCHER DID I SEE THE COLOSSAL 
AMOUNT OF BLOOD 
WHEN HE RETIRED 
GRAHAM SWAPPED POLICING FOR LIFE AS 
A PASTOR HE HAS FAITH IN THE 
FUTURE OF THIS COMMUNITY PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE MORE AWARE MORE RACIALLY AWARE 
AND MORE TOLERANT I THINK PEOPLE 
ARE MORE TOLERANT NOW ANOTHER ANOTHER MEMBER OF ELTHAM'S COMMUNITY TOLD 
HE HE HAS HAD BEER BOTTLES THROWN 
AT HIM IN HIS LOCAL OFF LICENCE 
YOU AS A WHITE LADY THERE IS 
NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU BUT 
ME AS A BLACK PERSON JUST WALK 
HERE I GET LOT OF HEADACHE IN HERE IN THIS SHOP I'M NOT HAPPY 
WITH MY CHILDREN TO GROW UP IN 
ELTHAM WHAT I'M THINKING NOW O. K. 
BECAUSE I'M A FATHER AND THESE ARE 
MY CHILDREN I WANT TO TAKE THEM TO 
PRIVATE SCHOOL IN UGANDA ONE ONE EXPERT BELIEVES DESPITE CHANGES IN 
THE LAW FOLLOWING STEPHEN'S DEATH 
RACIALLY MOTIVATED CRIME IS 
UNDERREPORTED 
THE BEST ESTIMATES UNDERREPORTED WE HAVE ARE THAT THERE ARE AROUND 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND INCIDENTS A YEAR BUT MOST 
PEOPLE THINK THAT IS A BIG 
UNDERESTIMATE 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A UNDERESTIMATE LARGE NUMBER TO ME HAVE THINGS 
MOVED ON SINCE STEPHEN LAWRENCE'S 
DEATH 
I THINK WHILE THE LAWRENCE DEATH CASE FOCUSES OUR MIND ON 
SPECIFICALLY RACIST CRIME I THINK 
THAT WHAT WE HAVE ALONGSIDE THAT IS 
OTHER FORMS OF HATE CRIME THAT ARE 
PERHAPS NOT SO VISIBLE AND I THINK 
THAT'S CRIMES AGAINST PEOPLE 
BECAUSE OF THEIR SEXUALITY BECAUSE 
OF THEIR FAITH BECAUSE OF THEIR 
DISABILITY THERE NEEDS TO BE AN 
EMPHASIS ON PREVENTION CUTTING OUT 
THE SOURCE IT HAS TO HAPPEN 
LITERALLY AT SCHOOL LEVEL THAT WE 
BEGIN TO TEACH YOUNG PEOPLE THAT IT 
IS NOT ACCEPTABLE 
THE TEENAGERS 
TAT LOCAL Y. M. C. A. ARE AROUND THE SAME 
AGE STEPHEN WAS WHEN HE WAS 
MURDERED FIFTEEN YEARS ON ARE THEY 
AWARE OF RACIAL TENSION 
THINGS ARE 
STILL THE SAME PEOPLE ARE STILL 
KILLING OTHER PEOPLE FOR THE WRONG 
REASONS 
YOU CAN WALK DOWN THE REASONS STREET AND PEOPLE ARE THROWING 
RACIAL REMARKS AT PEOPLE AND I 
THINK BEING RACIST IS DISGUSTING 
YOU CAN'T GO IN CERTAIN AREAS 
BECAUSE THERE ARE WHITE PEOPLE 
THERE AND LIKE THE MARTIN LUTHER 
KING THING IN A WAY 
YOU FELT IT 
WAS THAT SEGREGATED YES ONE YES ONE WORKER BELIEVES IT IS NOT JUST THE 
COLOUR OF YOUR SKIN THAT CAN 
PROVOKE TROUBLE IT'S TURF WAR TOO 
WE HAVE PROBLEMS AROUND GANGS TOO FROM DIFFERENT POSTCODES FROM 
DIFFERENT AREAS FROM OUR YOUNG 
PEOPLE GOING INTO DIFFERENT AREAS 
AND OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE COMING TO 
OUR AREA L. THINK THAT MOST OF 
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T EVEN SEE 
THE RACISM ONCE THEY WALK INTO THE 
BUILDING THERE IS NO RACISM IN THIS 
BUILDING AT ALL IF THERE WAS IT 
WOULD BE DEALT WITH L. DON'T THINK 
IT IS THE COLOUR OF YOUR SKIN IT 
IS WHO YOU ARE AND HOW YOU CAN 
INTERACT WITH OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE 
SOCIALLY 
THE POLICE INQUIRY INTO SOCIALLY STEPHEN'S DEATH REMAINS OPEN FIFTEEN 
YEARS ON GRAHAM'S THOUGHTS STILL 
TURN TO THE TEENAGER EVERY DAY MY MY PRAYER IS THAT THIS EVIL THING WILL 
BE EXPOSED AND THOSE THAT WERE 
RESPONSIBLE WILL BE BROUGHT TO 
JUSTICE AND FACE UP TO THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS 
THE INVESTIGATION RE OPENED LAST 
YEAR WHAT STATE IS IT IN THE THE POLICE ARE TREATING IT AS A LIVE 
MURDER INVESTIGATION THERE WAS 
SOME TALK ABOUT NEW FORENSIC 
EVIDENCE THAT HAD COME TO LIGHT 
BUT NO ARRESTS ARE IMMINENT IT IS 
BEING TREATED AS A LIVE MURDER 
INVESTIGATION 
FORTY YEARS ON FROM INVESTIGATION ENOCH POWELL'S INFAMOUS RIVERS OF 
BLOOD SPEECH ALMOST EXACTLY FORTY 
YEARS ON WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS 
WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE ON IT BEING 
IN SOUTH EAST LONDON WERE YOU 
SURPRISED 
I WAS REALLY SURPRISED SURPRISED WE DID ENCOUNTER SOME PEOPLE 
SHOUTING AT US AND HALF OF IT IS 
BECAUSE THEY MAY SENSE THAT WE ARE 
RE OPENING OLD WOUNDS BUT TO ME IT 
JUST SEEMED VERY EDGY AND THERE 
STILL DIDN'T SEEM 
ON RACIAL 
LINES 
YEAH WE SPOKE TO 
THE GUY IN LINES THE OFF LICENCE AND HE HAD 
EXPERIENCED RACIAL ABUSE IT IS 
CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING BEFORE I 
WENT THERE I THOUGHT I COULD TICK 
THAT BOX L. DON'T FEEL THAT WE HAVE 
MOVED ON THAT IS NOT WHAT I SAW 
YOU LIVE IN BRIGHTON AND YOU THINK 
IT IS A NICE MULTI CULTURAL SAFE 
ENVIRONMENT AND YOU GO TO ELTHAM 
AND YOU ARE BROUGHT UP SHARPLY BY 
IT 
ABSOLUTELY L. WAS BEING DRIVEN IT THROUGH BRIGHTON AND SOMEONE THREW 
SOMETHING AT THE WINDSCREEN AND HE 
SAID HE THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE OF 
HIS COLOUR IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN 
EVERY WHERE L. THINK WE STILL HAVE 
A LOT OF WORK TO DO 
WE WOULD KID 
OURSELVES THAT IT IS SORTED AND IT 
ISN'T 
NANCY HOW DO YOU THINK ISN'T LONDON FARES WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
RACE ISSUE 
I DON'T THINK WHEN 
YOU THINK ABOUT LONDON ENGLAND AS 
A MULTI RACE HERE SO I HAVE NEVER 
FELT THERE WAS ANY STRONG RACIAL 
ISSUES OVER HERE OVER IN ENGLAND 
THIS IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE OF 
COURSE IN ITALY LATELY FROM 
EXPERIENCE IN NEW YORK WHERE IT'S 
BEEN MORE IN AMERICA LIKE LONDON 
AND ALWAYS IT IS A MATTER OVER 
EDUCATION OF COURSE 
IN ITALY WE 
HAVEN'T GOT TIME BUT THERE IS AN 
INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS FROM NORTH 
AFRICA 
THAT IS CAUSING SOME AFRICA TENSION THAT IS INTERESTING AN TENSION AN INCREDIBLE THIRTY ONE MILLION PRESCRIPTIONS 
FOR ANTI DEPRESSANTS WERE ISSUED 
LAST YEAR IN THE U. K. EVEN MORE 
INCREDIBLE IS RESEARCH EARLIER THIS 
YEAR WHICH SUGGESTS THE NEW 
GENERATION OF ANTI DEPRESSANTS ARE 
ACTUALLY NO MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A 
SUGAR PILL 
THAT IS NOT TO SAY 
THE DRUGS DON'T WORK RATHER THAT 
IF YOU BELIEVE A SUGAR PILL IS AN 
ANTI DEPRESSANT IT WILL DO THE JOB 
JUST AS WELL MICHAEL MOSLEY LOOKS 
AT THE PLACEBO EFFECT FOR US 
I HAVE COME TO THIS LIDO TO DO AN 
EXPERIMENT ON THE PLACEBO EFFECT 
THE IDEA IS YOU CAN USE A PILL TO 
MAKE SOMEONE BETTER EVEN THOUGH THE 
PILL HAS NO ACTIVE INGREDIENTS SO 
WILL THESE PLACEBO PILLS RELIEVE 
THE PAIN OF FREEZING COLD WATER ON 
THESE UNSUSPECTING VOLUNTEERS WHAT 
I'M GOING TO DO IS I HAVE GOT A 
VERY SIMPLE VITAMIN PILL HERE BUT 
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS PERSUADE 
THAT GROUP OVER THERE THAT THIS IS 
AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL PAINKILLER 
TO DO THAT WE NEED AN ELABORATE 
SET UP THE KEY THING ABOUT THE 
PLACEBO EFFECT IS IT WORKS BEST 
WHEN PEOPLE BELIEVE THE TREATMENT 
IS EFFECTIVE WE HAVE TOLD OUR 
VOLUNTEERS THAT THE PILLS WE ARE 
GIVING THEM ARE POWERFUL 
PAINKILLERS STRONG ENOUGH TO BLOCK 
THE PAIN OF COLD WATER ARE YOU UP 
FOR THAT YES 
TO INCREASE THEIR YES FAITH WE HAVE ENLISTED SOME HELP 
I'VE GOT AN EXPERT ON PAIN AND ALSO 
COLD WATER AND I ALSO HAVE KEVIN 
MURPHY WHO IS OF THE 
ENGLISH CHANNEL 
DO YOU MIND 
STRIPPING OFF NOW YES 
THE GROUP YES HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT CHANNEL SWIMMER 
KEVIN TOOK TWO OF OUR SPECIAL 
PAINKILLERS EARLIER TODAY NOTICE 
ANY DIFFERENCE 
YES ABSOLUTELY MY 
HANDS DON'T HURT MY FEET DON'T 
HURT RIGHT 
THEY WOULD DO NORMALLY HURT RIGHT YOU THINK THIS IS WORKING 
IT IS 
YEAH 
INTERESTING THANK YOU KEVIN YEAH OUR NEXT PIECE OF PERSUASION SOME 
IRRELEVANT SCIENCE 
WE DO KNOW 
IBUPROFEN IS AN ANTI INFLAMMATORY 
NOW EVERYONE POPS THE PAINKILLER 
THE EXPERIMENT SHOULD WORK WILL 
IT TIME TO FIND OUT WE ARE ABOUT 
TO INFLICT SOME PAIN WITH ICE COLD 
WATER READY STEADY GO I'VE DONE 
THIS MYSELF AND IT IS REALLY 
PAINFUL FEW PEOPLE CAN STAND IT 
FOR LONG AS WE DISCOVERED WHEN WE 
DID TRIAL RUN WITHOUT THE PILL 
BEFORE MICHAEL GAVE UP WITHIN 
SECONDS NOW REMARKABLY HE'S 
LASTING A LOT LONGER NEXT OUT WAS 
LORRAINE ON OUR PILL SHE IS STILL 
GOING STRONG IT REALLY IS WORKING 
SO WHAT IS GOING ON IS IT JUST A 
TRICK OF THE MIND 
MINDS DON'T 
EXIST SEPARATELY FROM BODIES SO 
WHEN OUR MIND IS HAPPY THE BODY 
RESPONDS IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY 
THE PLACEBO ALTERS THE PERCEPTION 
OF SYMPTOMS BUT IT CAN AFFECT THE 
UNDERLYING PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BODY 
TOO WHY IT WORKS WE JUST DON'T 
KNOW 
SCIENTISTS DON'T FULLY KNOW UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM THEY HAVE 
DISCOVERED THAT PLACEBOS REALLY DO 
CHANGE THE BODY'S PHYSICAL 
RESPONSES AND CAN ALTER THE BRAIN 
IN A SIMILAR WAY TO REAL 
PAINKILLERS I AM AMAZED AT HOW 
WELL THIS TEST HAS GONE AFTER 
TAKING THE PILL FIVE PEOPLE LASTED 
THE FULL FOUR MINUTES COMPARED TO 
THREE WITHOUT THE PILL 
THE FIRST 
TIME I FOUND THE PAIN UNBEARABLE 
THE SECOND TIME AROUND THE PAIN WAS 
MORE BEARABLE 
THE SECOND TIME I 
JUST DIDN'T FEEL ANY PAIN 
NOW IS 
THE TIME TO REVEAL WHAT THIS TEST 
WAS REALLY ABOUT BECAUSE IT IS 
REALLY ABOUT THE PLACEBO EFFECT 
AH IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH COLD 
WATER NOW DO ANY OF YOU FEEL ANGRY 
WITH ME FOR HAVING DECEIVED YOU NO NO NO 
THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR NO TAKING PART L. HAVE PLENTY OF PILLS 
IF ANYONE FANCIES ONE THEY WILL 
MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD THEY WILL MAKE 
YOU FEEL BETTER ANY VOLUNTEERS 
IT WASN'T JUST BECAUSE THEY HAD GOT 
USED TO IT SECOND TIME AROUND THAT 
THEY FOUND IT EASIER 
WE PUT A GOOD 
GAP IN BETWEEN AND THE ANTICIPATION 
AND FEAR WOULD MAKE IT WORSE THE 
SECOND TIME REALLY 
WE WERE REALLY QUESTIONING YOUR METHODOLOGY THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
DOES THE PLACEBO 
EFFECT EXIST WITH ALL DRUGS IF I 
BOTHER MY DOCTOR FOR SOME 
ANTIBIOTICS AND SHE GIVES ME SOME 
SUGAR PILL S. WOULD THAT HAVE AN 
AFFECT ON ME 
IT WOULD CERTAINLY 
HAVE AN IMPACT 
WHY DON'T THE N. H. S. 
JUST GIVE OUT SUGAR PILL S. THEN 
IT IS IMMORAL THEY USED TO COME 
ALONG WITH A TONIC AND THEY SAID 
THIS IS VERY GOOD FOR YOU BUT WE 
ARE CONSTRAINED BY ETHICAL 
COMMITTEES 
THERE SOMETHING IN COMMITTEES THE COLOUR OF THE PILL THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT I WAS ADMIRING THIS RED 
DRESS HERE 
WE ARE TALKING OF 
PILLS 
ANTIBIOTICS WORK REALLY WELL PILLS WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF RED AND 
WHITE 
THAT IS A NONSENSE THE WHITE PILLS WOULD ALL BE WHITE DOESN'T DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL THE COLOUR HAS AN 
AFFECT ON THE WAY WE PERCEIVE 
THINGS 
THAT IS INCREDIBLE NANCY THINGS NANCY AS A FASHION ICON IT STRUCK US 
THAT THERE IS A PLACEBO EFFECT WITH 
FASHION IT IS DESPERATE LINK WE 
ARE MAKING BETWEEN TABLETS AND 
HANDBAGS BUT STAY WITH US 
IT WILL 
BE WORTH IT 
FAKE HANDBAGS CAN BE 
JUST AS EFFECTIVE AS THE REAL THING 
IT CAN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO COME 
WITH ME WE WOULD LIKE TO PUT THIS 
THEORY TO THE TEST 
AS A STYLE ICON WE WANT TO PUT YOU 
UP AGAINST SOMEONE WHO ISN'T 
ADRIAN O. K. THERE YOU GO WE WANT 
YOU 
COME AROUND THIS WAY O. K. L. YOU O. K. I AM GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT EACH OF 
THESE BAGS AND I WANT TO YOU 
DECIDE IF IT'S REAL OR FAKE THE 
SAME FOR YOU THIS WILL BE EASY FOR 
YOU WON'T IT 
NO TOUCHING NO NO TOUCHING FIRSTLY A LOIS VITTON 
LITTLE NUMBER WHAT DO YOU THINK

WORK OF ART L. RECKON THAT'S REAL 
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DETAILS 
WE'RE AT TWENTY FIVE PAST SEVEN HUNDRED P. M. WE HAVE TO 
HURRY YOU ALONG COME ON NANCY 
YOU'RE TAKING THIS TOO SERIOUSLY I I AM NOT SURE 
IT'S ONLY FOR FUN

THIS BIT OF SILVERWARE IS THE 
BARCLAY'S PREMIERE LEAGUE TROPHY 
WE'LL KNOW WITHIN THREE WEEKS WHO 
IS GOING TO LIFT IT L. THINK IT 
WILL BE MANCHESTER CITY SO THESE 
BLACK AND WHITE RIBBONS WILL STILL 
STAY IN PLACE 
WIGAN WON THE 
PREMIERE LEAGUE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AT 
THAT TIME THE AVERAGE AGE OF SALARY 
FOR A FOOTBALLER WAS SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR 
RIO FERDINAND MANCHESTER CITY'S 
DEFENDER IS NOW ON SOMETHING LIKE 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A WEEK HOW DO YOU GO 
ABOUT SPENDING THAT KIND OF MONEY 
ANGELLICA BELL'S PLAYERS WONDER IF 
THEY HAVE MORE MONEY THAN SENSE 
FOOTBALL HAS AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN 
OUR LIVES MANY FANS HARK BACK TO A 
TIME WHEN PLAYERS WERE WORKING 
CLASS HEROES WHO SEEMINGLY ONLY 
PLAYED FOR THE LOVE OF THE 
BEAUTIFUL GAME HOW HAS OUR 
PERCEPTION OF FOOTBALLERS CHANGED 
WITH TRANSFER FEES AND SALARIES ON 
THE INCREASE JUSTIFYING THE AMOUNT 
OF MONEY PAID TO PLAYERS CAN 
SOMETIMES BE HOPELESS TASK 
ESPECIALLY WHEN SOME EARN IN A YEAR 
WHAT MOST OF US TAKE A LIFETIME TO 
ACHIEVE 
THEY'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT FLAUNTING 
IT EITHER BY PUBLICLY BUYING 
LUXURY CARS HOUSES AND OF COURSE 
KEEPING THOSE WAGS HAPPY SCARLET 
ANDREWS LOOKS AFTER SOME OF 
ENGLAND'S TOP PLAYERS MANAGING 
THEIR CAREERS AND FINDING THEM THE 
BEST DEALS 
WHAT ARE TOP FOOTBALL PLAYERS 
EARNING 
THAT TOP FOOTBALLER CAN EARNING EARN FIVE SIX MILLION A YEAR 
DO YOU 
THINK THAT'S JUSTIFIABLE FOOTBALL FOOTBALL IS A MULTI BILLION POUND INDUSTRY 
WHAT ARE FOOTBALLERS ACTUALLY 
SPENDING THEIR MONEY ON 
IT'S NOT 
UNCOMMON FOR FOOTBALLERS TO BUY 
CARS LIKE ASTON MARTINS THEY'RE 
GOING TO FLY FIRST CLASS AND STAY 
IN THE MOST LUXURIOUS HOLIDAY 
DESTINATIONS IN MAGAZINES THERE'S 
SO MUCH TALKED ABOUT THEIR 
LIFESTYLE IT'S EVEN MOVED ON TO 
THE GIRLFRIENDS DID WHAT WERE THEY 
SPENDING SPENDING THIRTY FIVE WEEK WAS THE FIRST SALARY I 
HAD THEN WE GOT OUR FOUR IF WE WON 
GAME TWO IF 
WE DREW GAME AND IF WE LOST A GAME ZILCH 
GEORGE BEST 
AS HIGHLY PAID AS HE WAS FOR THE 
TIME COMPARED TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND A WEEK 
NO WHERE NEAR IT'S REALLY 
DIFFICULT FOR YOUR AVERAGE 
SPECTATOR TO READ ALL THESE STORIES 
ABOUT THESE PLAYERS GOOD LUCK TO 
THEM IT'S UP TO THEM WHAT THEY DO 
WITH THE MONEY BUT I THINK IT'S 
GOT TO STAGE NOW AT TIMES WHERE I 
BELIEVE IT'S OBSCENE TWO THOUSAND SIX ENGLAND 
IN THE WORLD CUP THE FACT THAT THE 
WIVES AND THE GIRLFRIENDS WERE 
PARKED DOWN THE ROAD IN ANOTHER 
HOTEL AND YOU TALKED MORE ABOUT THE 
WAGS THAN THE ACTUAL FOOTBALL I 
THINK IT'S IMCREDIBLE CHRISTIANO 
RONALDO THIERRY HENRY ALL OF 
THESE GUY GUYS WHO PROVIDED SO 
MUCH ENJOYMENT THEY COME AT A 
PRICE AND THAT PRICE COULD BE TO 
THE DETRIMENT OF THE GAME AND 
CERTAINLY TO THE FANS WATCHING 
WHAT'S YOU'RE VIEW ON THIS YOU 
HAVE MIXED WITH FOOTBALLERS WHAT'S 
YOUR VIEW ON THE WAY THEY SPEND 
THEIR MONEY ARE THEY IRRESPONSIBLE 
OR JUST LIVING LIFE TO THE FULL I I NEVER LIKE GENERALLY SPEAKING L. 
THINK SOME OF THEM MAY BE BUT I 
KNOW FROM MY EXPERIENCE MOST OF 
THEM ARE VERY CONSCIOUS ABOUT A BIT 
OF MONEY OF COURSE THEY WHEN 
YOU MAKE SUCH A KIND OF MONEY YOU 
TRY TO START THE DAY COMING FROM 
A LOW BACKGROUND YOU TRY TO HAVE 
SOMETHING THAT YOU ALWAYS BEEN 
DESIRED OF COURSE SOME OF THEM 
THEY SPEND THE MONEY BUT I DON'T 
THINK YOU CAN GENERALLY THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE WIVES AND GIRLFRIENDS 
FOR 
THEY KNOW THERE IS A LIMIT OF FOR TIME 
CHRISTINE HAS BEEN READING TIME YOUR BOOK AVIDLY 
SO PLEASED ABOUT 
IT 
I WAS SAYING TO HIM EARLIER A IT LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY KNOW 
YOU HAVING JUST READ THE TABLOID 
PRESS WHICH IS NOT OBVIOUSLY 
CORRECT ALL OF THE TIME 
NO MOST 
OF THE TIME NOT 
OF COURSE VERY 
EARLY ON IN THE BOOK YOU SPEAK OF 
THE CAR ACCIDENT THAT HAPPENED WHEN 
YOU WERE JUST TWENTY ONE I THINK IF I 
REMEMBER CORRECTLY 
THAT'S CORRECT 
THAT JUST CHANGED EVERYTHING 
DIDN'T IT YOUR VIEWS ON LIFE YOU YOU DON'T KNOW REALLY HOW MUCH IN WAY 
CONSCIOUSLY THE CHANGE HAS BEEN 
UNCONSCIOUSLY OF COURSE THAT 
RAISES THE LEVEL OF YOUR 
CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE AWARENESS OF 
THINGS IN LIFE FOR ME THE TRICK 
WAS TO TRANSFORM THIS EXPERIENCE 
INTO A VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE 
AND I HAVE BEEN DEFINITELY MORE 
MATURE 
YOU WERE IN 
A COMA THIS IS MATURE A VERY VERY SERIOUS TIME FOR YOU 
IT DEFINITELY WAS A SERIOUS TIME 
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HAPPENS WHEN 
YOU'RE TWENTY ONE YOU NEVER THINK THINGS 
LIKE THIS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN IT 
MADE ME MUCH STRONGER 
IT'S A VERY 
DIFFICULT THING TO GO THROUGH BUT 
IN LATER LIFE YOU MOVE ON IT SEEMS 
TO ME YOU WENT THROUGH A LOT OF 
PAIN BEING WITH SVEN WITHOUT 
REAGANING OVER HOT COALS THERE WAS 
SOME SHOCKING TABLOID HEADLINES 
SOME OF WHICH WERE BASED IN TRUTH 
AND YOU WERE CHASED BY THE 
PAPARAZZI ELSEWHERE WOULD YOU HAVE 
DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY PERHAPS AND 
NOT FALLEN IN LOVE WITH SUCH A 
HIGH PROFILE MAN 
NO WHEN I WAS 
WITH SVEN I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS HIGH 
PROFILE ANYWAY BUT OF COURSE YOU 
DON'T THINK IT WHEN YOU FALL IN 
LOVE IT'S SOMETHING YOU CONSIDER 
ESPECIALLY IN ENGLAND THE FACT 
THAT BUT IT GOES THE TERRITORY 
THAN YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS 
REAL WHAT IS NOT REAL AND WHAT 
WAS I KNEW WHAT THE TRUTH WAS AND 
THE TRUTH IS AND WHEN YOU LIVE 
TOGETHER I KNEW WHAT WAS IN THE 
PAPER WAS NOT NECESSARILY TO BE 
REAL 
LISTEN IT'S GREAT READ TAX REAL BOOK I HAVEN'T HAD A WORD OUT OF 
CHRISTINE FOR A FEW WEEKS 
IT'S ALL 
IN THERE YOU CLEAR UP A FEW KEY 
POINTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
DARTMOOR IS FAMOUS BRITISH WORLD 
AND IS KNOWN FOR ITS PRISON AND 
PONIES WHILE THE PRISON POPULATION 
IS ON THE INCREASE THE PONYS ARE 
IN SERIOUS DECLINE 
ELLIE HARRISON 
HAS BEEN TO DEVON TO LOOK AT THE 
TROUBLED FUTURE FOR THESE CREATURES 
THE PONIES 
THE PONY HAS BEEN A SIJ OF DARTMOOR 
NATIONAL PARK SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE WHEN IT 
WAS ESTABLISHED SYMBOL BACK THEN 
THERE WERE THIRTY THOUSAND PONIES ON THE 
MOOR BUT SINCE THEN THEIR NUMBERS 
HAVE DROPPED DRAMATICALLY THEY'RE 
VITAL TO MAINTAIN THE WILDERNESS 
HERE SO WHAT WENT WRONG TEN YEARS 
AGO THEY WERE BEING SOLD TWO FOR A 
POUND 
THE HOMES THAT HAVE FOR POUND PONIES COULD START TO DISAPPEAR 
BECAUSE OF THE PRICE IN THE MARKET 
PEOPLE JUST SHOOT THEM AND PUT THEM 
IN A BIG PIT THERE IS LITERALLY 
NOTHING ELSE WE CAN DO WITH THE 
DARTMOOR PONIES THERE IS ONLY A 
CERTAIN AMOUNT WE CAN SELL TO 
PEOPLE FOR RIDING PONIES THE REST 
WE HAVE TO HAVE MEAT TRADE FOR 
AND IF THERE'S NO MEAT TRADE I'M 
AFRAID THERE WILL BE NO MORE 
DARTMOOR PONIES ON DARTMOOR ANYMORE 
NEARLY TEN YEARS ON DREW 
BUTTERFIELD IS ONE OF THE MANY 
BREEDERS STILL TRYING TO TURN 
AROUND THE PONIES' FATE IN 
CONSTANTLY CHANGING WORLD LIVE LIVE EXPORT HAS BEEN BANNED SO WE NO 
LONGER HAVE THAT FRENCH LUKE ATIVE 
EXPORT MARKET PONY NUMBERS 
INCREASED AS THE NUMBER OF USES FOR 
THE PONIES DECREASED WE HAD COAL 
MINING SHETLAND PONIES WERE 
BROUGHT DOWN THEY BRED WITH THE 
DARTMOOR PONIES THEY PRODUCED A 
GOOD PIT PONY BUT OF COURSE WE NO 
LONGER HAVE COAL MINING THIRTY YEARS 
AGO THERE WERE SIXTY THOUSAND PONIES ON 
DARTMOOR THAT HAS CRASH DOWN OF 
THE HERITAGE STOCK WE HAVE PROBABLY 
GOT AROUND FOUR HUNDRED BREEDING MAIRS LEFT 
ON THE COMMONS OF DARTMOOR NOW L. 
WOULD SAY THAT'S A CRITICAL 
SITUATION SITUATION HISTORICALLY SEVERAL TYPES OF PONY 
HAVE LIVED ON THE MOOR BUT DREW 
SPECIALISES IN THE ICONIC BAY OR 
BROWN ONES WHICH SHE'S BRANDED THE 
HERITAGE PONY THE KEY TO 
SAFEGUARDING THEIR FUTURE IS TO 
INCREASE THEIR MARKET VALUE SO SHE 
PROMOTES HERITAGE STOCK AS THE 
IDEAL GRAZER FOR CONSERVATION LAND 
SHE SOLD FIVE MARES TO THE NATIONAL 
TRUST AND TEENBRIDGE DISTRICT 
COUNCIL THE WARDENS HAVE COME TO 
HER FARM TO LEARN HOW TO HANDLE 
THEM THESE WILD PONYS HAVE ONLY 
JUST COME IN OFF THE MOOR SO 
EVERYONE IS ON TENTERHOOKS 
YESTERDAY MORNING SHE CAME IN 
UNTOUCHED 
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER UNTOUCHED SHE NEVER HANDLED NO 
THERE IS NO FINE BALANCE BETWEEN HANDLING AND 
STRESSING A WILD PONY SUDDEN KICK 
COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY 
EVEN DIRECT EYE CONTACT COULD SPOOK 
THEM 
WHAT WE WANT TO DO WITH THIS THEM LITTLE PONY IS WORK THIS MORNING ON 
JUST BEING ABLE TO TOUCH HER BUT 
WE DON'T WANT TO OVER TAME HER 
THIS IS MAYBE A PONY WE HAVE TO 
WORM AND IF WE'VE GOT TO WORM THEM 
WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THEM 
HERE AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PUT 
SOMETHING IN HER MOUTH 
DON'T LET 
HER DO THAT TO YOU SHE'S JUST 
DON'T LEAVE YOUR HAND THERE THE THE SITE THEY'RE GOING TO IS A VERY 
PUBLIC SITE A LOT OF DOG WALKERS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT'LL BE OUT 
THERE ENJOYING WALKS ON THE COAST 
AND PEOPLE CAN'T RESIST FEEDING A 
PONY AND IF YOU START FEEDING A 
PONY IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS SO WE 
WANT THESE PONYS TO RETAIN THEIR 
WARINESS AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE 
TO BE ABLE TO ADMINISTER ROUTINE 
CARE BUT YOU CAN SEE WE'VE GOT ALL 
THE GUYS HERE LEARNING HOW TO WORK 
WITH THE PONIES AND TOGETHER 
WE'RE SETTING THEM UP TO WIN 
DO YOU WANT TO KIND OF HAVE A FEEL 
OF WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO ACTUALLY 
YEAH YEAH BECAUSE IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT TO 
GOING UP TO A DOMESTICATED HORSE I I TRY TO STAY CALM 
YEAH IF YOU'RE 
CALM THE PONY WILL BE CALM IF SHE 
DOES ANYTHING REACTIVE WELL WE'LL 
JUST DEAL WITH IT IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE THEY'RE SO 
SMALL YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO BE 
A LITTLE BIT VULNERABLE REALLY 
BUT THEY'RE TOUGH 
THEY REALLY IT IT HAS BEEN A NERVE RACKING THEY HERE 
FOR BOTH THE WARDENS AND THE PONY 
BUT TOMORROW WILL BE THE TRUE TEST 
WHEN THEY ATTEMPT TO MOVE THEM TO 
THEIR NEW HOME 
O. K. JUST KEEP YOUR 
EYES DOWN AND WE'LL JUST LET 
THEM DRIVE THEM THROUGH GOODNESS GOODNESS O. K. ELLIE YOU STAY AND KEEP THAT 
STRONG GOT IT 
THERE ARE THREE PONIES SOMEWHERE ON 
DARTMOOR ON THE RUN FROM ELLIE

OF THE FILM TOMORROW IF WE CAN FIND
