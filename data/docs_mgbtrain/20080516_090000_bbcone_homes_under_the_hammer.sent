HELLO LIKE MOST PEOPLE WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN THE PROPERTY MARKET 
I'M ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A BARGAIN 
HOW DO YOU GET ONE ONE WAY IS TO VISIT YOUR LOCAL PROPERTY AUCTION 
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PROPERTY AUCTIONS AVAILABLE EVERY YEAR SO YOU REALLY ARE SPOILT FOR CHOICE 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT MADE OUR BUYERS PART WITH THEIR CASH TODAY 
WHAT THIS END OF TERRACE IN READING HAS IN HEIGHT IT LACKS IN WIDTH 
YOU COULDN'T EVEN GET A SINGLE BED IN HERE LET ALONE A WARDROBE 
I SPEND AN AFTERNOON IN LEAFY NOTTINGHAM AMONGST THESE GORGEOUS HOUSES BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY I'M HERE TO SEE THIS 
AND IN KENT THERE'S A DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD FROM SCRATCH 
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO CASH IN HOW ABOUT TWO 
ALL THESE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN SOLD AT AUCTION 
AND WE'LL FIND OUT WHO BOUGHT THEM AND WHAT THEY PAID FOR THEM WHEN THEY WENT UNDER THE HAMMER 
READING HAS TWO UNIVERSITIES MAKING IT AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE FOR INVESTORS 
AS THERE'S ALWAYS DEMAND FOR PROPERTY FROM THE MANY STUDENTS WHO PASS THROUGH 
AND AUCTIONS ARE A VERY GOOD PLACE TO START IN YOUR SEARCH FOR ONE AT THE RIGHT PRICE 
WELCOME TO WESTERN ROAD 
THE PROPERTY I'M HERE TO SEE IS AN EXTENDED END OF TERRACE 
WITH THREE BEDROOMS AND TWO RECEPTION ROOMS 
BUT THE SIZE ISN'T REFLECTED IN ITS MODEST GUIDE PRICE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
I'M GOING TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND INSIDE 
SO HAD THE WESTERN ROAD HOUSE BEEN ATTACKED BY COWBOY BUILDERS OR IS IT WORTH A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS 
THE EXTERIOR'S NOT GIVING MUCH AWAY 
IT'S FAIRLY NARROW BUT QUITE DEEP AS AN EXTENSION HAS BEEN ADDED 
THE FRONT GARDEN HOWEVER IS FAR FROM MAGNIFICENT 
THE EXTERIOR HAS NO CHARACTER WITH THAT PAINTED PEBBLE DASH 
AND THE INTERIOR SADLY LOOKS TO BE THE SAME 
IT'S QUITE A SMALL SPACE IN HERE BUT A HUGE BONUS ARE THESE NEW DOUBLE GLAZED WINDOWS 
I'VE GOT TO SAY THEY SEEM TO BE WORKING REALLY WELL YOU'VE GOT CENTRAL HEATING IN HERE 
SOMETHING YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET WITH AUCTION PROPERTY 
THROUGH HERE WE'VE GOT THE SECOND RECEPTION ROOM 
NOW BECAUSE THIS PROPERTY IS END OF TERRACE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS BIG OLD WALL IS THE PAVEMENT 
SO THIS WINDOW HAS BEEN INSTALLED UP HIGH BUT IT DOES LET SOME LIGHT IN 
NOW I'VE BEEN THINKING YOU COULD USE THIS SPACE AS A DINING ROOM PERHAPS 
IT'S ACTUALLY THE SAME SIZE AS NEXT DOOR 
BUT THIS PROPERTY ON THE FACE OF IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT DULL 
BUT ONCE YOU'VE PAINTED THE WALLS PUT SOME NEW FLOORING DOWN 
EVEN A NEW LAMPSHADE I THINK THIS PROPERTY WILL BE TRANSFORMED AND IT WILL START TO LOOK LIKE A HOME 
THIS GALLEY KITCHEN REALLY NEEDS SOME CLEVER DESIGN BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S JUST NOT WORKING 
YOU'VE GOT A COOKER HERE A SMALL AMOUNT OF WORK SPACE HERE 
TO PREPARE ALL OF YOUR MEALS A BIG DOUBLE SINK AREA 
YOU'VE GOT A BOILER AND A HUGE BATHROOM TO THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY 
I WOULD TRY AND MOVE THAT BATHROOM UPSTAIRS AND EXTEND THIS KITCHEN 
CLEARLY THE EXTENSION WAS ADDED IN ORDER TO GET A BATHROOM IN AND INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE KITCHEN 
BUT IT'S FAIRLY NARROW AND A BATHROOM OFF THE KITCHEN ISN'T POPULAR WITH MOST PEOPLE 
UPSTAIRS WE'VE GOT THREE BEDROOMS 
THERE'S ONE IN HERE AND ANOTHER THROUGH HERE AND YOU'VE GOT THIS LITTLE CORRIDOR SPACE 
AND THE END ROOM IS JUST TINY LOOK 
YOU COULDN'T EVEN GET A SINGLE BED IN HERE LET ALONE A WARDROBE 
BUT THIS SPACE WOULD BE PERFECT FOR A BATHROOM 
MOVING THE BATHROOM UP HERE WOULD GIVE YOU A BIGGER KITCHEN SPACE 
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS IN THE NIGHT TO USE THE LOO 
THAT'S GOOD NEWS THERE'S AN OPTION HERE FOR A SHOWER OR BATH OR AT THE VERY LEAST AN UPSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT YOU'D LOSE A BEDROOM AND IT'S AN ADDED EXPENSE 
SO THAT'S THE GOOD AND THE BAD NOW I'VE FOUND THE UGLY 
I'VE SEEN SOMETHING HERE THAT DOES WORRY ME 
THAT BIG OLD CRACK LOOKS SERIOUS 
I'M GOING TO GO OUTSIDE AND DO SOME INVESTIGATING 
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND MORE CLOSELY THERE'S NOT JUST ONE CRACK INSIDE BUT SEVERAL 
NOW THAT'S NOT GOOD 
AS I SUSPECTED NOW YOU CAN SEE THAT CRACK ON THIS SIDE ELEVATION 
IT COULD POSE A REAL STRUCTURAL PROBLEM IF IT'S NOT ADDRESSED 
I WOULD CALL A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER AND GET THIS PLACE SURVEYED 
IT'S BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY WHEN YOU'RE BUYING AN AUCTION PROPERTY THERE'S NO GOING BACK 
WITHOUT A STRUCTURAL SURVEY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHETHER 
THE CRACKS ARE A SIGN OF A MINOR PROBLEM OR A MORE SERIOUS ONE 
BUT YOU NEED TO FIND WHICH CATEGORY THEY FALL INTO A MORTGAGE LENDER WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY WANT TO KNOW 
QUITE SIMPLY THEY'RE NOT TO BE IGNORED 
WHAT DOES A LOCAL AGENT THINK OF THE HOUSE 
MY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THIS PROPERTY WOULD BE TO USE THE THIRD BEDROOM 
AS A STUDY ROOM OR DRESSING ROOM OR TAKE THE BATHROOM UPSTAIRS 
WHAT SORT OF PRICE CAN YOU GET FOR A TWO BEDROOM HOUSE IN READING 
IF I WAS TO PLACE THIS PROPERTY ON TO THE MARKET IN GOOD DECORATIVE ORDER 
I BELIEVE WE COULD PLACE IT ON AT AROUND THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY TO ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
THE PROPERTY COULD BE RENTED OUT BETWEEN EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE TO EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY PER CALENDAR MONTH 
SO QUITE HEALTHY RETURNS ON BOTH RESALE AND RENTAL 
MY WORRY THOUGH IS HOW HEALTHY THE STRUCTURE OF THE HOUSE IS 
SUPER LOCATION WITH ADAPTABLE ACCOMMODATION AND THAT VERY LOW GUIDE PRICE 
WESTERN ROAD CERTAINLY HAS A LOT GOING FOR IT 
LET'S SEE WHO WENT FOR IT AT THE AUCTION 
WE MOVE ON TO LOT TWENTY ONE WHICH IS SEVENTY ONE WESTERN ROAD READING 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO START ME SEE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ANYWHERE 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY BID 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO ANYWHERE ELSE 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND THEN 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO IT'S AGAINST YOU ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
YEAH NEW PLACE ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT 
TAKE ONE IF IT HELPS YOU 
YES ANOTHER ONE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN HERE 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT NOW 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE 
BID ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND THEN 
FOR THE FIRST TIME AT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND 
SECOND TIME 
THIRD AND FINAL TIME 
SOLD YOUR LOT SIR WELL DONE 
SO FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND THE NEW OWNER IS LOCAL MAN SURINDA 
HE'S MARRIED WITH THREE CHILDREN AGED BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWENTY FIVE 
THIS IS SURINDA'S FIRST AUCTION PROPERTY AND HOPEFULLY IT'S THE START OF A PROFITABLE SIDELINE 
SURINDA CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU 
SO WHAT'S THE IDEA OF YOU BUYING A PROPERTY 
LONG TERM WELL I WANT TO RETIRE COS I'M GETTING CLOSE TO THE AGE 
AND HOPEFULLY IT'S SOMETHING TO DO AFTER I GIVE UP WORK 
SO THIS IS A BIT OF A PENSION PLAN FOR YOU REALLY SORT OF YEAH 
WELL THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF MANY PENSION PLANS AS SURINDA HAS HAD A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CAREERS 
I STARTED OFF WITH BRITISH AEROSPACE AFTER I FINISHED MY STUDIES 
AND I WORKED THERE FOR ABOUT THREE AND A HALF YEARS I TOOK SOME TIME OFF 
I WENT TO INDIA THAT'S WHERE I MET MY WIFE 
AND WE CAME BACK AND GOT MARRIED 
AND I GOT ANOTHER JOB WHICH WAS TO DO WITH MEDICAL EQUIPMENT 
AND THEN I GOT AS FAR AS I COULD AND I JUST WANTED TO YOU KNOW DO SOMETHING ON MY OWN 
AND I ENDED UP BUYING A POST OFFICE LOCALLY HERE WHERE I SPENT ABOUT TWELVE YEARS DOING THAT 
BUT THERE IS NO REAL SOCIAL LIFE 
AS FAR AS EVERYBODY ELSE WAS CONCERNED I OWN THE BUSINESS BUT I THINK IT TURNED OUT THE OTHER WAY 
THE BUSINESS OWNED ME SO EVENTUALLY I GAVE UP AND GOT A JOB WITH A LOCAL SUPERMARKET COMPANY 
SO I COULD JUST GO THERE COME OUT AND FORGET ABOUT IT 
AND I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF MY OWN LIFE BACK REALLY 
DO YOU FEEL HAPPIER NOW THAT YOU CAN SPEND QUALITY TIME WITH YOUR KIDS AND YOUR WIFE ABSOLUTELY YEAH 
SO ALL IS WELL IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD AT THE MOMENT YEAH FOR THE TIME BEING 
AND YOU'VE JUST GONE OFF AND BOUGHT AN AUCTION PROPERTY YEAH 
SURINDA CLEARLY LIKES TAKING ON NEW CHALLENGES 
AND WITH THIS HOUSE HE MAY HAVE MORE THAN HE WAS EXPECTING 
BUT HE'S CONFIDENT THAT HIS PREVIOUS WORK EXPERIENCES WILL STAND HIM IN GOOD STEAD WITH THIS REFURBISHMENT 
SO HOW WILL YOU USE YOUR BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE ON THIS JOB 
WELL LUCKILY I WAS HERE LOCALLY AND I'VE MADE A LOT OF FRIENDS 
WHILE I WAS AT THE POST OFFICE SO I'VE COME TO KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP ME WITH THIS PROJECT 
ELECTRICIANS PLUMBERS AND BUILDERS SO THAT WILL COME IN HANDY 
SO THE ONLY THING THAT WORRIES ME IS HAVING NOT GOT THE SURVEY DONE BEFORE THE AUCTION 
AND I WENT OUTSIDE AND CHECKED THE EXTERIOR WALL 
ARE THERE ANY PROBLEMS THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT STRUCTURALLY 
NOT AT THE MOMENT I DID SEE THE CRACKS 
THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEER IS COMING TOMORROW TO DO A SURVEY 
IS THAT BECAUSE THE MORTGAGE COMPANY REQUIRES THAT 
YES IS THAT WORRYING YOU THAT THE MORTGAGE COMPANY HAVE ASKED YOU FOR THAT 
WELL YES AND NO IT'S A GOOD THING THAT IT'S COME UP NOW AND I'M ABLE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
RATHER THAN FINDING OUT LATER ON AND HAVING MORE EXPENDITURE ABOUT IT 
SO I CAN DEAL WITH IT IF I FIND OUT AT A GOOD TIME 
WHAT IF YOU CAN'T MORTGAGE THIS PROPERTY WOULD THAT THROW A SPANNER IN THE WORKS 
AH IT WOULD A LITTLE BIT YES 
BUT THEN YOU LEARN BY YOUR MISTAKES 
HOPEFULLY I'LL HAVE TO BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME 
LET'S HOPE IT DOESN'T COME TO THAT SURINDA WILL HAVE A STRESSFUL WAIT BEFORE HE KNOWS WHERE HE STANDS 
WITH A HOUSE LIKE THIS I'D ALWAYS RECOMMEND A SURVEY BEFORE YOU BUY 
IT MIGHT SEEM A BIG EXPENSE WHEN YOU MIGHT NOT GET IT ON THE DAY 
BUT IT COULD SAVE YOU A SMALL FORTUNE IN THE LONG RUN 
ARE YOU GOING TO LET IT OUT OR DO IT UP AND SELL IT ON 
THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST TO REDRESS IT 
DO THE PAINTING AND HOPEFULLY DO THE KITCHEN AND THE BATHROOM AND DEPENDING ON THE MARKET 
AT THE TIME MY IDEA IS TO SELL IT BUT IF THE MARKET DOESN'T DICTATE THAT THEN I MIGHT RENT IT OUT 
WHAT SORT OF BUDGET HAVE YOU GOT 
I WOULD SAY APPROXIMATELY ABOUT THREE THOUSAND IS MY LIMIT AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MANAGE WITHIN THAT 
COS IT'S MOSTLY THE BATHROOM AND THE KITCHEN AND THE GENERAL PAINTWORK 
THREE THOUSAND IS A PRETTY SMALL AMOUNT 
HAVING THOSE FRIENDS IN THE TRADE WILL HELP BUT HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO A LOT HIMSELF TO STAY ON BUDGET 
SO WHAT DOES YOUR WIFE THINK OF THIS SHE'S ALL FOR IT YES 
SHE'S PROMPTED ME ON TO DO THIS SO WE'RE BOTH IN IT TOGETHER 
SHE'S QUITE HAPPY ABOUT IT 
SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE HAVING LATE NIGHTS WORKING IN YOUR SUPERMARKET LONG DAYS RENOVATING YOUR HOUSE 
ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THIS HARD WORK HOPEFULLY I SHOULD GET SOME HELP 
IT'S MORE LIKE A FAMILY PROJECT 
I'VE GOT A SON AND DAUGHTER AND MY WIFE 
HOPEFULLY WE CAN ALL CHIP IN AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT 
WITH HIS ELECTRONIC HEALTHCARE POST OFFICE AND SUPERMARKET BACKGROUND 
LET'S HOPE THAT SURINDA CAN ADD PROPERTY DEVELOPER TO HIS DIVERSE WORK PORTFOLIO 
SURINDA GAVE UP A BUSINESS THAT WAS RUNNING HIM MORE THAN HE WAS RUNNING IT 
THE FATHER OF THREE HAS MADE A BRAVE AND REALLY INSPIRATIONAL CAREER CHANGE HERE AND I WISH HIM WELL 
I'M SURE HE CAN PUT THOSE BUSINESS SKILLS TO GOOD USE ON THIS PROJECT 
WE'LL FIND OUT HOW IT ALL GOES LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME 
THIS IS RUDDINGTON A DESIRABLE AND SOUGHT AFTER VILLAGE FIVE MILES SOUTH OF NOTTINGHAM 
RUDDINGTON IS SMALL BUT IT HAS THREE MUSEUMS AND SEVERAL GRAND HOUSES 
ORIGINALLY BUILT FOR WEALTHY INDUSTRIALISTS FROM NOTTINGHAM 
THIS IS MANOR PARK A LOVELY PRIVATE LEAFY ROAD CLOSE TO THE VILLAGE CENTRE 
IT'S LINED WITH GORGEOUS EDWARDIAN HOUSES JUST THE SORT OF THING I LOVE LOOKING AROUND 
UNFORTUNATELY I'M HERE TO SEE THIS 
IT'S A CONCRETE CARBUNCLE BUT IT'S THE THING THAT'S UP FOR AUCTION 
IT'S ON AT A GUIDE PRICE OF A COOL ONE MILLION 
FOR A SITE THAT AMOUNTS TO TWENTY TWO ACRES IN TOTAL 
SO DOES IT GET ANY BETTER WHEN YOU GET INSIDE 
ER NO IT'S GOT ABOUT AS MUCH CHARACTER AS A CHEST FREEZER 
IT IS ACTUALLY A RESIDENTIAL CARE HOME PURPOSE BUILT SO I SUPPOSE YOU CAN EXPECT THIS 
IT'S UTILITARIAN AND FUNCTIONAL 
SQUARE ROOMS BUT YOU HAVE GOT A LOT OF SPACE BUT IN TERMS OF CHARACTER 
IT CERTAINLY HASN'T GOT ANY OF THAT 
ORCHARD HOUSE AMALGAMATED WITH ANOTHER CARE HOME 
SO ALL THE RESIDENTS WERE MOVED LEAVING BEHIND AN EERIE MAZE OF CORRIDORS AND EMPTY BEDROOMS 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS PLACE ONLY CLOSED A FEW MONTHS AGO 
IT WOULDN'T MEET CURRENT REGULATIONS FOR THIS KIND OF USE 
THE ROOMS ARE TOO SMALL THEY DON'T HAVE EN SUITE FACILITIES 
SO YOUR OPTIONS WOULD BE TO COMPLETELY REFURBISH IT 
AND USE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE OR MY PREFERRED OPTION KNOCK IT DOWN 
THE CARE HOME WAS BUILT IN THE GROUNDS OF A FORMER MANOR HOUSE 
AND EVEN NOW THE GARDENS MAKE UP A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE SITE 
THE NICEST THING ABOUT THE PROPERTY IS THE LAND THAT IT SITS ON 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS AND TOTALLY OUT OF CHARACTER WITH THE BUILDING 
THERE'S NO PLANNING PERMISSION AT THE MOMENT FOR CHANGING THIS PLACE 
THE PLANNERS HAVE SAID YOU CAN ONLY BUILD SOMETHING ON THE SAME FOOTPRINT AS THIS BUILDING 
SO YOU COULDN'T BUILD ON THIS LAND WHICH ACTUALLY IS A BIT OF A RELIEF 
HOWEVER I'M SURE THEY WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF ANYTHING COS IT'S GOT TO BE BETTER THAN THAT 
BUT BEFORE ANYONE RUSHES IN WITH THE BULLDOZERS THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THEIR RESEARCH 
THIS ENTIRE PLOT IS WITHIN A CONSERVATION AREA BUILDING INCLUDED 
UNATTRACTIVE THOUGH IT MAY BE YOU CAN'T SIMPLY KNOCK IT DOWN 
WITHOUT FIRST INVOLVING CONSERVATIONISTS AND THE LOCAL COUNCIL 
AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH IT'S ALSO CLASSED AS AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ALERT SITE 
THIS MEANS WORK COULD BE HALTED INDEFINITELY 
IF ANYTHING OF HISTORICAL INTEREST IS UNEARTHED DURING THE EXCAVATIONS 
ALL IN ALL THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE AN EASY OR CHEAP SITE TO DEVELOP 
SO WHAT DOES A LOCAL PROPERTY EXPERT MAKE OF THIS UNCARED FOR CARE HOME 
HAS THERE BEEN A LOT OF PRE AUCTION INTEREST 
WE'VE HAD QUITE A LOT OF INTEREST BOTH FROM PRIVATE NURSING HOMES 
WANTING TO REFURBISH THE PROPERTY AND ALSO FROM DEVELOPERS 
THERE IS A BIG DEMAND FOR HOUSES IN RUDDINGTON AT THE MOMENT 
AND THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF NEW DEVELOPMENT POPPING UP IN AND AROUND THE AREA 
WITH THAT ONE MILLION GUIDE PRICE WHAT WOULD BE THE VALUE OF ANYTHING BUILT HERE 
FOR A TWO BEDROOMED APARTMENT WITHIN RUDDINGTON WE CURRENTLY HAVE A FEW 
RANGING FROM ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
HOUSES AGAIN RANGE FOR A TWO BEDROOMED TOWN HOUSE 
FROM JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND CAN GO RIGHT UP TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
AT THE TOP END OF THE SCALE WE'RE CURRENTLY MARKING FOUR BEDROOMED PROPERTIES FOR FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
SO IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE NATURE OF WHAT IS BUILT 
YOU KNOW ME I'M NORMALLY A BIG FAN OF KEEPING AND RESTORING OLD BUILDINGS 
BUT IN THIS CASE I THINK YOU'LL BE DOING THE WORLD A FAVOUR BY TAKING A VERY BIG HAMMER TO THIS PLACE 
IT'S DISGUSTING AND I'M SURE YOU'D GET THE SUPPORT OF THE PLANNING AUTHORITIES TO KNOCK IT DOWN 
SO WHO'S READY TO TAKE IT ON 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN IT WENT TO THE AUCTION 
LOT TWENTY NINE ORCHARD HOUSE MANOR PARK RUDDINGTON 
FORMER RESIDENTIAL CARE HOME AND ADJOINING GARDENS NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO START 
NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND IF YOU LIKE 
EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THEN IF YOU LIKE 
EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND I'LL TAKE IT IN TWENTY FIVES 
SEVENTY FIVE ANYWHERE EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY 
SEVENTY FIVE SEVEN FIVE NINE HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED 
NINE HUNDRED SITTING DOWN NINE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE SIR TWENTY FIVE THE NOD FIFTY SIR FIFTY SEVENTY FIVE 
SEVENTY FIVE ONE MILLION SIR ONE MILLION 
AND TWENTY FIVE THE NOD AT TWENTY FIVE FIFTY AND FIFTY 
SEVENTY FIVE SIR ONE MILLION FIFTY THOUSAND ARE WE ALL DONE 
AND WE SHALL BE SELLING AT ONE MILLION AND SEVENTY FIVE 
ONE POINT ONE SIR ELEVEN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE SIR ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ANYWHERE 
FIFTY SEVENTY FIVE SIR SEVENTY FIVE THE NOD 
ONE POINT TWO IT'S AT TWELVE 
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE SIR TEN THOUSAND 
ONE POINT TWO ONE ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND TWENTY 
ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
FOR THE FIRST TIME ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
SECOND TIME AT ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
THIRTY SIR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ALL DONE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME AT ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
FOR THE SECOND TIME ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND FORTY ANYWHERE 
THIRD AND FINAL TIME AT ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
ALL DONE 
YOURS SIR 
THE MAN WHO PAID ONE POINT TWO THREE MILLION FOR THAT CONCRETE CARBUNCLE OF A CARE HOME IS CHARLIE 
BUT HE DIDN'T BUY IT FOR HIMSELF 
HE WORKS AS A LAND BUYER FOR A LARGE PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WHICH SPECIALISES IN NEW BUILDS 
I MET UP WITH CHARLIE BACK AT ORCHARD HOUSE 
CHARLIE NICE TO MEET YOU NICE TO MEET YOU CONGRATULATIONS THANKS 
I STILL FEEL A BIT STRANGE WHEN THINGS SELL FOR OVER ONE MILLION AT AUCTION YEAH IT'S VERY EXCITING 
SO HOW DID IT FEEL TO SPEND OVER A MILLION QUID ON THIS PLACE 
I GET A GREAT BUZZ OUT OF BUYING AT AUCTION 
IT'S VERY ENJOYABLE WHEN IT COMES OFF 
BUT WE BOUGHT AT A FIGURE THAT WE'RE HAPPY AT SO I WAS VERY EXCITED 
SO WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WALKED IN HERE WELL WE'RE NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT THE PROPERTY ITSELF 
WE LIKED THE PLOT WE THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT OF AN OASIS IN RUDDINGTON AND A VERY NICE SITE 
WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF PUTTING HOUSES ON IT 
THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR PUTTING APARTMENTS AND POTENTIAL FOR A NEW CARE HOME 
AND THE NUMBER THAT WE PAID FITS IN ON ALL OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES 
SO WE CAN MOVE IN WHICHEVER DIRECTION THE PLANNERS WILL ALLOW 
LET ME TAKE YOU BACK TO THE AUCTION YOU'RE NOT SPENDING YOUR MONEY 
BUT YOUR HEAD'S ON THE BLOCK IF YOU MESS IT UP AND I HAVE A BLANK CHEQUE YOU DO YES 
BLANK CHEQUEBOOK ONE CHEQUE 
HOW DOES THAT FEEL LOSE IT AT THE PETROL STATION ON THE WAY THERE 
THEY DO JOKE ABOUT ME NOT DISAPPEARING WHEN I LEAVE THE OFFICE WOW YES BARBADOS HERE WE COME 
TEMPTING BUT CHARLIE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T RUN OFF WITH THAT BLANK CHEQUE 
THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN EXPLORING THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM FOR DEVELOPING THE PLOT 
SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE 
THE SITE OUTLINE IS AROUND THERE TWENTY TWO ACRES IN ALL O. K. 
AND THE DEVELOPABLE AREA IS ALONG THAT LINE THERE OH NINE ACRES 
AND WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING TO DO THERE 
WELL THIS IS JUST ONE OPTION 
BASICALLY WE'VE GOT TWO MANSION BUILDINGS WHICH WILL REFLECT THE AREA AND THE HOUSES IN THE LOCALITY 
BUT JUST IN CASE TWO MANSION BLOCKS ARE NOT TO THE PLANNERS' LIKING THERE'S A BACK UP PLAN 
ANOTHER THEME OF APARTMENTS 
JUST ONE BLOCK CONTAINING THE SAME NUMBER OF APARTMENTS 
AND THAT'S 
THE BASEMENT CAR PARKING YOU CAN SEE AND THREE LEVELS WITH A PARAPET WALL AND A HIDDEN FOURTH LEVEL 
SO THAT FROM THE FRONT YOU'D ONLY SEE THE ROOF 
HOW MANY APARTMENTS DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET ON HERE 
IF WE WENT DOWN THAT ROUTE MAXIMUM FOURTEEN 
WHAT'S YOUR IDEA FOR WHAT THESE APARTMENT WILL BE LIKE 
WE'D BE LOOKING AT LARGE THREE BED APARTMENTS PREMIUM FIT OUT SO THEY'D BE EXPENSIVE 
CAN YOU GIVE ME AN IDEA OF THE ONWARD SALE PRICE OF THOSE 
IN THE REGION OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
IT HASN'T BEEN SET IN STONE YET BUT ROUGH BALL PARK IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH THE PROJECT'S GOING TO COST YOU 
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT DEVELOPMENT WILL BE IN THE RANGE OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO TWO MILLION 
MM HMM WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO 
YEAH AND WHAT ABOUT TIMESCALES FOR ALL THIS 
HOW LONG'S A PIECE OF STRING PLANNING MIGHT TAKE SIX MONTHS 
AND THEN DEVELOPMENT FROM THEN ON DEPENDING ON WHAT WE DO WOULD PROBABLY TAKE EIGHT MONTHS RIGHT 
WELL GOOD LUCK AT THE NEXT AUCTION WITH YOUR BLANK CHEQUEBOOK AND GOOD LUCK WITH THE PLANS THANKS 
WELL THIS WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A BIG PROJECT FOR SOMEBODY TO TAKE ON 
SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT IT'S A BIG COMMERCIAL DEVELOPER WHO HAS BOUGHT IT 
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO WITH THIS FAIRLY DISMAL BUILDING FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW 
IN KENT THERE'S AN AUCTION LOT WITH GREAT POTENTIAL PLENTY OF SPACE 
AND IF YOU PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT IT COULD MAKE LOTS OF MONEY 
SO WHAT'S THE CATCH 
DID THE BUYERS OF THIS FORMER CARE HOME NEAR NOTTINGHAM TAKE MY ADVICE 
MY PREFERRED OPTION KNOCK IT DOWN 
BUT FIRST LET'S FIND OUT IF RETIRED POST OFFICE OWNER SURINDA 
HAS STAMPED HIS MARK ON THIS END OF TERRACE IN READING 
BACK AT WESTERN ROAD IN READING SURINDA HAD BOUGHT A THREE BED END OF TERRACE HOUSE FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND 
THE HOUSE HAD SOME GOOD SIZE BEDROOMS A BAD DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM AND SOME UGLY CRACKS 
BUT SURINDA HOPED IT WOULD OFFER HIM A CHANCE TO SECURE HIS FUTURE 
LONG TERM WELL I WANT TO RETIRE COS I'M GETTING CLOSE TO THE AGE 
AND HOPEFULLY IT'S SOMETHING TO DO AFTER I GIVE UP WORK 
SO THIS IS A BIT OF A PENSION PLAN FOR YOU REALLY SORT OF YEAH 
SO THREE MONTHS LATER DID HIS PENSION PLAN LOOK MAGNIFICENT OR HAD IT BITTEN THE DUST 
FROM THE OUTSIDE AT LEAST THERE ARE PROMISING SIGNS 
THERE'S FRESH PAINTWORK AND THAT SHABBY FRONT GARDEN AREA'S LOOKING TIDIER AND MUCH MORE PRESENTABLE 
THE INSIDE HAS BEEN MODERNISED WITH A COMBINATION OF OLD AND NEW FITTINGS AND FIXTURES 
AND THE GARDEN AREA'S ALSO BEEN GIVEN A NEW LEASE OF LIFE 
WE LOOKED AT THE GARDEN AND IT WAS NOT LOOKING VERY NICE AT ALL 
THERE WERE A LOT OF WEEDS 
SO WE TOOK ALL THE SLABS OFF AND WE PUT SOME SHINGLE ON THERE JUST TO SORT OF BRIGHTEN IT UP 
AND WE PUT SOME POTS WITH FLOWERS 
AND A LITTLE BIRD TABLE AS WELL WHICH HAS MADE IT LOOK A LOT NICER 
AND IT'S BRIGHTENED UP THE WHOLE PLACE AND I'M QUITE HAPPY WITH IT 
SO THE PLACE LOOKS FINISHED AND READY TO GO 
BUT IS THE NEW DECORATION JUST PAPERING OVER THOSE CRACKS 
WHEN I HAD THE SURVEY DONE THAT REASSURED ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING STRUCTURALLY WRONG 
OR THERE WAS NOTHING DANGEROUS SO THAT WAS THE MAIN THING 
IF I HAD GOT THE SURVEY DONE PREVIOUSLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER BUT YOU LEARN 
A LOT OF THE CRACKS WERE OLD AND NOT AN INDICATION THAT THERE'D BEEN RECENT MOVEMENT 
THEY WEREN'T UNUSUAL FOR PROPERTIES IN THE AREA AND PARTICULARLY AN END OF TERRACE 
SO SURINDA COULD CARRY ON DECORATING IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO CRACK UP BEFORE HIS EYES 
PREPARATION WAS THE MAIN THING AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME 
AND I WAS DRIVING ALONG ONE DAY AND I SAW THIS POSTER SAYING HANDYMAN 
AND I RANG THE GUY UP AND I SAID CAN I HAVE AN ESTIMATE SO WE MET 
AND HE HAD A FRIEND WHO HELPS HIM 
WITH MOST OF THE DECORATION AND EVERYTHING AND HIS NAME'S RICK 
SO HE'S DONE MOST OF THE PAINTING FOR ME 
JUST THE WHOLE COMPLETE HOUSE REALLY FROM TOP TO BOTTOM 
FROM DECORATING TO RE TILING THE KITCHEN FOR HIM 
AND JUST MAKING SURE THE PROPERTY LOOKS ABSOLUTELY FINE 
HE'S DONE A VERY GOOD JOB AND I'M VERY PLEASED WITH HIM I THINK WE'VE BECOME GOOD FRIENDS SINCE THEN 
NICE GUY NICE GUY 
WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE LIKE A FRIENDSHIP THROUGH THE THING THE HOUSE SO YEAH IT'S REALLY GOOD 
SURINDA ALSO HAD SOME HELP FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE FINDING RICK WAS A RELIEF 
SURINDA STILL HAS A FULL TIME JOB AND THOUGH IT'S MOSTLY NIGHT WORK 
FINDING THE TIME TO DO UP A HOUSE IS TOUGH 
BUT PAYING SOMEONE TO DO THE WORK OBVIOUSLY AFFECTS THE BUDGET 
I THINK MY BUDGET ORIGINALLY WAS ABOUT THREE THOUSAND AND I'M SURE I'M PRETTY CLOSE TO IT 
I HAVEN'T WORKED IT OUT IN EXACT FIGURES BUT I DON'T THINK I'M FAR OFF 
THAT IS PRETTY REMARKABLE 
TO MAKE ALL THESE CHANGES AND ONLY SPEND THREE THOUSAND 
IT JUST SHOWS THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY TO RIP EVERYTHING OUT AND START AGAIN 
IF YOU SAVE THE RIGHT THINGS THEN YOU CAN ALSO SAVE TIME AND MONEY 
I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THE WAY IT TURNED OUT 
IF IT CARRIES ON LIKE THAT THEN HOPEFULLY I CAN RETIRE INTO THIS COS I REALLY ENJOY THIS 
AND REALLY I OWN THE BUSINESS THIS TIME BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO GET UP AT ANY SPECIFIC TIME 
I DON'T HAVE TO WORK ONE DAY IF I DON'T WANT TO 
SO IT'S A NICE BUSINESS TO BE IN FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW 
SO SURINDA FEELS HE'S NOW GOT MORE CONTROL OF HIS LIFE AND RICKY'S KEEN TO DO THE SAME 
IT'S JUST SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO SINCE I WAS YOUNG 
AND I WILL DO THAT NOW I'VE GONE THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE WITH SURINDA OF HOW HE'S DONE HIS PROPERTY 
AND OBVIOUSLY MOVE IT ON AS WELL SO GREAT 
SO RICKY AND SURINDA MAY HAVE MORE PROPERTIES AHEAD 
BUT FOR NOW WHAT'S THE FUTURE FOR THEIR CURRENT PROJECT 
NEXT IS TO SELL THIS PROPERTY AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE AS QUICKLY AS I CAN 
THAT MIGHT BE THE PLAN BUT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN SURINDA WILL NEED TO SEE SOME PROFIT HERE 
HE BOUGHT THE HOUSE FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND AT AUCTION AND HAS SPENT THREE THOUSAND ON IT SO FAR 
BUT WHAT DO TWO LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS THINK HAS HE MADE ENOUGH MONEY TO MOVE ON TO ANOTHER PROJECT 
MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE PROPERTY GOOD CLEAN AND TIDY VERY PRESENTABLE 
THE AREA THE PROPERTY'S IN IS GOOD 
IT'S QUIET BUT IT'S VERY VERY CLOSE 
TO THE TOWN CENTRE AND LOCAL TRANSPORT LINKS AS WELL 
OUTSIDE SPACE IS IMPORTANT TO FIRST TIME BUYERS 
A SMALL COURTYARD GARDEN IS NORMALLY ENOUGH FOR THEM 
THE ROADS ARE VERY NARROW AND IT IS JUST ON ROAD PARKING 
SO IF IT WERE SOMEBODY WITH MORE THAN ONE CAR IT MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM 
HAS SURINDA'S WESTERN AVENUE HOUSE SHOT UP IN VALUE FROM THE TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND HE'S SPENT ON IT 
FOR THIS PROPERTY TO SELL IN THE CURRENT MARKET IT WOULD GO ON AT BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND AND ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND 
I'D PUT THIS PROPERTY ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN SOUNDS GOOD 
WELL I WAS HOPING FOR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MYSELF 
SO IF THAT'S THE CASE YEAH THAT'S VERY GOOD 
I'M QUITE PLEASED 
MAYBE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND IS A LITTLE OPTIMISTIC 
BUT AT THE VERY LEAST SURINDA SHOULD MAKE ABOUT A TWENTY THOUSAND PROFIT 
EVEN WITH DEDUCTIONS THAT'S A PRETTY DECENT RETURN FOR A FIRST TIME 
SO DOES SURINDA INTEND TO CARRY ON WITH MORE DEVELOPING 
IT'S MY RETIREMENT PLAN AND HOPEFULLY IF I CAN GET IT GOING 
IF I CAN GET THREE PROPERTIES A YEAR OR SOMETHING THAT WILL DO ME QUITE NICELY 
IT SOUNDS LIKE SURINDA AND PERHAPS RICK TOO 
HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF THEM BEFORE SURINDA CAN RIDE OFF INTO THE SUNSET 
I'M IN GRAVESEND IN KENT TODAY 
AN AREA REGARDED AS BEING ON THE LONDON FRINGE 
ITS CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE CAPITAL HAS ALWAYS MADE IT A DESIRABLE PLACE FOR HOMEBUYERS AND INVESTORS ALIKE 
TALK OF IMPROVED TRANSPORT LINKS AT NEARBY EBBSFLEET 
CLAIMING TO HAVE YOU IN LONDON IN SEVENTEEN MINUTES IS REALLY CAUSING A FLURRY OF EXCITEMENT 
AND THIS EXCITEMENT IS REFLECTED IN PROPERTY PRICES 
WELL THIS IS ALEXANDRA ROAD AND THE AUCTION CATALOGUE TELLS ME 
THE LOT THAT I'VE COME TO SEE IS SITUATED IN A NICE RESIDENTIAL AREA 
IT'S GOT POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL AND THE GUIDE PRICE FIFTY THOUSAND TO FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND 
SO WHAT'S THE CATCH 
IT'S A LOVELY PAIR OF GARAGES 
IF YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THE OIL CANS AND DIRTY RAGS 
GARAGES CAN MAKE VALUABLE ASSETS BOTH FOR PARKING CARS OR STORAGE 
BUT WITH THESE TWO GARAGES AND SURROUNDING LAND THERE'S A MORE INTRIGUING STORY 
YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS THE LAST AVAILABLE PIECE OF LAND TO DEVELOP 
HOUSES HAVE JUST SPRUNG UP ALL AROUND THESE TWO GARAGES HERE 
AND I THINK THE COUNCIL WOULD LOOK FAVOURABLY ON DEVELOPERS PLANNING TO BUILD HERE 
YOU CAN ONLY IMPROVE THE LOOK OF THIS ROAD AND YOUR BANK BALANCE COULD LOOK JUST AS ATTRACTIVE 
BUT THERE'S ONE THING STOPPING THIS IDEA GETTING INTO TOP GEAR 
THE FACT THAT THE GARAGES DON'T COME WITH ANY PLANNING PERMISSION 
SO WHOEVER BUYS THEM WILL HAVE TO CHANCE THEIR LUCK WITH THE LOCAL PLANNING OFFICE 
IT'S RISKY BUT WITH RISK CAN COME REWARD 
NOW THIS SITE MEASURES SEVENTY FIVE METRES BY TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT 
IT'S SIZABLE AND MY GUESS IS WELL YOU COULD QUITE COMFORTABLY FIT A HOUSE ON THIS PLOT 
OR IF YOU REALLY WANT TO CASH IN HOW ABOUT TWO 
BEFORE WE GO MOTORING OFF TO THE AUCTION HOUSE 
IT'S TIME TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES AND REFLECT ON WHETHER THESE TWO GARAGES AND LAND ARE A GOOD INVESTMENT 
I ASKED A LOCAL AGENT 
GRAVESEND'S DEVELOPING VASTLY 
YOU'VE GOT THE CANAL BASIN WHERE THERE IS HUGE DEVELOPMENT GOING ON 
EBBSFLEET VALLEY INTERNATIONAL STATION 
IS TEN MINUTES AWAY THE PRICES OF PROPERTIES WILL INCREASE BECAUSE YOU'LL BE IN LONDON QUICKLY 
O. K. IT'S AN IDEAL PROPERTY INVESTMENT AREA 
IF THE BUYER GOT PERMISSION AND BUILT ONE OR EVEN TWO HOUSES ON THE SITE 
HOW MUCH COULD HE OR SHE HOPE TO MAKE 
IF THE OWNER WAS TO BUILD A THREE BEDROOM PROPERTY 
HE'D PROBABLY ACHIEVE IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND 
FOUR BEDS YOU'D BE LOOKING AT PROBABLY BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW HOUSES AND FLATS BEING BUILT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS IN AND AROUND THIS AREA OF KENT 
THINGS LOOK VERY GOOD INDEED FOR THIS PLOT 
LET'S SEE WHO FEELS THE SAME WAY AT AUCTION

SECOND TIME AT SIXTY ONE THOUSAND 
IF YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE ALL DONE AT THE BACK THIRD AND FINAL TIME YOURS SIR FOR SIXTY ONE THOUSAND WELL DONE 
AND THE WINNING BIDDER IS STEVE A LOCAL BUILDER AND THIS IS HIS FIRST PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT VENTURE 
HE REMEMBERS THE GARAGES FROM HIS CHILDHOOD AND THINKS THEY USED TO HOUSE AN OLD ICE CREAM VAN 
BUT FLIGHTS OF NOSTALGIA ASIDE THINGS HAVE GOT SERIOUS FOR STEVE 
HE'S RAISED THE MONEY FOR BUYING THE GARAGES BY REMORTGAGING THE HOUSE HE SHARES WITH HIS PARTNER 
SO STEVE DID YOU ENJOY THE AUCTION PROCESS 
IT WAS A BIT NERVE WRACKING I STARTED BIDDING TOWARDS THE END 
AND IT WENT JUST OVER THE ASKING PRICE WHICH WAS REALLY GOOD NEWS 
SIXTY ONE THOUSAND SIXTY ONE WERE YOU PREPARED 
WE WAS PREPARED TO GO HIGHER THAN THAT I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD TELL YOU HOW MUCH I WANT TO KNOW SEVENTY 
YOU WERE GOING TO GO TO SEVENTY SEVENTY YEAH FOR A PAIR OF OLD GARAGES I KNOW SEVENTY WE THOUGHT WAS REALISTIC 
BUT GOT THEM FOR SIXTY ONE IN THE END 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO HERE WITH THESE OLD GARAGES 
PLAN IS UM TWO SEMI DETACHED COTTAGES THAT'S PLAN A 
OR FAILING THAT A DETACHED PROPERTY POSSIBLY FOUR BEDROOMS 
IT DEFINITELY LENDS ITSELF TO SOME SORT OF DWELLING I MEAN THESE TOTALLY LOOK OUT OF PLACE EXACTLY 
I THINK IT'S THE LAST PLOT TO BE DEVELOPED IN THE AREA AND WE'VE PICKED IT UP SO REALLY FORTUNATE 
SO WHAT'S YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF BUILDING PROPERTY 
BEEN IN THE BUILDING GAME REALLY ALL MY LIFE STARTED OFF WHEN I WAS A KID LABOURING ON SITES AND STUFF 
AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE OVER THE YEARS PICKED IT UP AS I WENT ALONG 
AND FOR HOW MANY YEARS HAVE YOU ACTUALLY BEEN BUILDING I'M GOING TO SHOW ME AGE NOW ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
AND I JUST THOUGHT IT'S ABOUT TIME I DONE SOMETHING FOR MYSELF NOW 
I WANT TO EARN THE MONEY OUT OF IT AND SO HERE WE ARE 
SO HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THIS AREA AND THIS SITE IN PARTICULAR 
I KNOW THE AREA FAIRLY WELL I WAS BORN IN GRAVESEND 
SO YOU MUST HAVE DRIVEN PAST THESE GARAGES FOR MANY YEARS YES 
DID YOU EVER THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE MINE ONE DAY NO I JUST THOUGHT WHAT A DIVE 
A DIVE I SUPPOSE IT IS A BIT 
THE GARDEN IS NEVER GOING TO WIN A GRAVESEND IN BLOOM COMPETITION 
BUT I'M SURE THE NEIGHBOURS WILL BE GLAD THAT SOMETHING IS FINALLY BEING DONE ABOUT THE SPACE 
STILL I'M A BIT WORRIED BECAUSE STEVE SEEMS TO BE UNDERESTIMATING HOW LONG PLANNING APPLICATIONS TAKE 
HANGING AROUND FOR SERVICES STUFF LIKE THAT PLANNING PERMISSION ETC ALL TAKES TIME 
YEAH WE'VE TAKEN THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND HOPEFULLY 
START BUILDING IN SORT OF TWO MONTHS POSSIBLY TEN WEEKS' TIME 
TWO MONTHS HE'LL BE LUCKY 
IS HIS BUDGET MORE REALISTIC 
SO YOU'VE SPENT SIXTY ON YOUR ACTUAL PLOT HERE YEAH 
WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET FOR THE BUILD IF PLAN A GOES AHEAD I. E. THE TWO COTTAGES 
PROBABLY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE WHOLE BUILD 
THE SINGLE DWELLING POSSIBLY SEVENTY TO EIGHTY AROUND THAT FIGURE 
BOTH OF THESE OPTIONS WILL GIVE HIM A DECENT PROFIT 
ONE PROBLEM WITH BUILDING NEXT TO LONG ESTABLISHED HOUSES IS THAT 
NEIGHBOURS CAN OFTEN BE UPSET BY THE NOISE DUST AND GENERAL DISTURBANCE THAT A BUILDING SITE CREATES 
BUT STEVE HAS ALREADY BEGUN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE NEIGHBOURS 
TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING GOES AS SMOOTHLY AS POSSIBLE 
HE'LL AGREE TO MY PLANS AND I KNOW ALSO HE'S GOT SOME PLANS OF HIS OWN 
TO BUILD A DOUBLE STOREY EXTENSION AS WELL SO WE'VE COMBINED THE SAME ARCHITECT 
TO HOPEFULLY ALLEVIATE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLY BUILD A PARTY WALL ETC 
SO YOU CAN ALL BE HAPPY THAT'S THE PLAN AND YOU CAN ALL WORK WELL TOGETHER 
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOME LIGHT SKETCHES CAN WE GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT THEM SURE LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
THIS IS ALL QUITE EXCITING IT IS SO WHAT ARE THESE JUST SKETCHES 
THEY'RE JUST A ROUGH SKETCH BASICALLY OF PLAN A THAT I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT 
THE TWO COTTAGES SO THIS IS WHAT IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE FROM THE OUTSIDE HOPEFULLY 
THREE FLOORS YEP THREE STOREYS THERE YEAH 
THERE'S THE OFF ROAD PARKING THERE LOUNGE DINER STAIRS TO THE SIDE AS OPPOSED TO IN THE MIDDLE YEAH 
GOOD SIZE KITCHEN WITH DOORS GOING OUT TO THE GARDEN PATIO DOORS PATIO AREA AND GARDEN 
O. K. AND THEN WE'VE GOT THE BEDROOMS THAT'S THE FIRST FLOOR YEP 
PROPOSED TWO BEDROOMS THERE BATHROOM W. C. BASIN O. K. 
AND YOU GO UP TO THE THIRD FLOOR 
YEP HOPEFULLY THIRD FLOOR POSSIBLY TWO BEDROOMS AND SOME STORAGE AREA OR EN SUITE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BASICALLY THIS IS JUST A ROUGH SKETCH THAT I CAN TAKE 
TO THE LOCAL PLANNING AUTHORITY AND JUST GIVE THEM MY ROUGH IDEAS 
THEN WE'LL SOURCE THE ARCHITECT TO DO THE DETAILED PLANS 
AND PERSONALLY I THINK THAT YOU KNOW A GOOD DEAL STARTS WITH GOOD PLANS DETAILED PLANS 
AND OBVIOUSLY WE'LL WORK FROM THOSE UNTIL THE JOB'S COMPLETE 
STEVE IS CURRENTLY PLANNING TO TRY AND PUT A THREE STOREY HOUSE ON THE GARAGE SITE 
THIS MIGHT BE PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE NONE OF THE NEARBY PROPERTIES GO ANY HIGHER THAN A SECOND FLOOR 
STILL IT'S A RISK THAT STEVE IS PREPARED TO TAKE 
DOES THIS REALLY EXCITE YOU 
IT DOES YEAH YEAH IT DOES 
IT EXCITES ME AND ALSO IT'S SCARY IN THE SAME VEIN 
IF WE DON'T GAIN PLANNING PERMISSION AND FOR SOME REASON WE CAN'T BUILD 
I'VE PAID SIXTY GRAND FOR TWO GARAGES 
AS LONG AS THE PLANNING GOES THROUGH EVERYONE WILL BE HAPPY 
STEVE HAS RISKED A LOT BUT WITH DEVELOPMENTS SPRINGING UP IN THE AREA AND PROPERTY IN HIGH DEMAND 
HE'S WILLING TO BET HIS HOUSE ON THIS VENTURE AND HE QUITE LITERALLY HAS DONE THAT 
THE CAUTIOUS AMONGST YOU WILL SHUDDER WHILE THE RECKLESS WILL JUST SMILE AT THE THOUGHT 
JOIN US LATER IN THE SHOW TO SEE IF IT WAS WORTH THE RISK 
WELL THERE HAS BEEN PLENTY OF TIME FOR OUR BUYERS TO HAVE STARTED WORK ON THEIR PROPERTIES 
YES BUT HAVE THEY DONE ANY WORK OR HAVE THEY BEEN DELAYED BY PROBLEMS 
TIME IS MONEY SO HAVE THEY MADE MONEY OR LOST OUT 
SHALL WE GO BACK AND SEE WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING LET'S DO IT 
IT'S BEEN ONE YEAR TO THE WEEK SINCE I MET CHARLIE A LAND BUYER FOR A LARGE PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT COMPANY 
HE'D PLACED THE WINNING BID OF ONE POINT TWO THREE MILLION FOR THIS OLD RESIDENTIAL CARE HOME 
THE PLAN WAS TO BUILD TWELVE TO FOURTEEN LUXURY APARTMENTS ON THE LAND WHERE THE CARE HOME STOOD 
A YEAR'S A LONG TIME IN BUSINESS AND WHEN I TRIED TO MEET CHARLIE 
I DISCOVERED HE'S SINCE MOVED ON TO OTHER PROJECTS 
SO THERE'S A NEW KID IN TOWN 
DEVELOPMENT SURVEYOR JULIAN 
I'VE TAKEN OVER OFF CHARLIE WHO BOUGHT THE SITE OFF SAVILLS AT AUCTION FOR TWELVE MILLION 
SO I'VE NOW SORT OF STEPPED IN AND THEY'RE BRINGING THE PROJECT FORWARD SLIGHTLY 
WHILE THE PROJECT HAS A NEW FACE UNFORTUNATELY THE OLD CARE HOME REMAINS UNTOUCHED 
SO WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE PLANS TO BUILD LUXURY APARTMENTS 
INITIALLY IT WAS OUR THOUGHT TO GO DOWN THE RESIDENTIAL ROUTE AS WE PICKED UP THE SITE FOR A GOOD PRICE 
WHICH GAVE US A NUMBER OF OPTIONS HIGH END RESIDENTIAL OR TO GO WITH EXISTING USE 
IT WAS FORMERLY A LOCAL AUTHORITY NURSING HOME 
WE'VE NOW DECIDED TO WORK WITH RELEVANT INTERESTS DOWN THE C. TWO USE 
THAT'S A CARE HOME TO YOU AND ME 
BUT THIS ONE WILL BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT 
THERE IS STILL DEMAND FOR CARE HOMES IN THIS AREA 
BUT AS THEY ARE A DEVELOPMENT THEY WANT TO CREATE DESIRABLE PROPERTIES AND MAKE AS MUCH PROFIT AS POSSIBLE 
SO THEY'VE COME UP WITH AN IDEA WHICH SUITS EVERYONE 
IT'S STILL GOING ALONG THE LINES OF HIGH END RESIDENTIAL 
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS WE'RE PROVIDING AN ASSISTED LIVING PRODUCT WHICH MEANS WE PROVIDE THE PROPERTY 
AND THEN WE'LL WORK WITH THE PROVIDER TO PROVIDE THE HEALTHCARE SIDE OF IT 
AND IT ENABLES OVER FIFTY FIVES TO BUY THEIR PROPERTY AS NORMAL 
AND THE ASSISTED ELEMENT IS IF THEY WANT OR SO WISH TO HAVE THE CARE IT'S THERE ON CALL 
THEY STILL BUY THEIR BRICKS AND MORTAR WITH THE CARE ELEMENT ON TOP 
WITH THE DECISION MADE THE COMPANY WORK CLOSELY WITH THE PLANNERS TO ENSURE 
THE NEW BUILD WOULD MEET THE NEEDS OF PROSPECTIVE RESIDENTS AND ALSO FIT IN WITH THE SURROUNDINGS 
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE FROM OUR ARCHITECT'S DRAWINGS 
WE'VE GONE FOR A MODERN CONTEMPORARY BUILDING WITH FEATURES THAT FIT IN 
SIMILAR TO THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR TO THE PROPERTY 
WHICH SOFTENS IT UP IT DOESN'T HAVE SO MUCH OF AN IMPACT IN THE AREA 
THE FRONT ELEVATION HERE 
YOU COME IN IT'S THE FRONT ACCESS 
AGAIN THE BUILDING IT'S NOT DOMINATING ABOVE THE SURROUNDING BUILDINGS THE EXISTING BUILDINGS 
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS ONE HERE IT FITS IN QUITE WELL WITH THE EXISTING SURROUNDINGS WHICH JUST 
ENHANCES THE ASSISTED LIVING PRODUCT 
ONCE BUILT THERE WOULD BE AROUND FORTY HIGH SPEC APARTMENTS WITH CARE FACILITIES ON SITE 
THE COMPANY CAN HAND THE WHOLE DEVELOPMENT OVER TO THE CARE PROVIDER ONCE IT'S FINISHED 
IF WE WERE TO BUILD OPEN MARKET RESIDENTIAL UNITS HERE 
THEN WE'D HAVE TO SELL EACH UNIT UNIT BY UNIT AND THE MARKET'S NOT FANTASTIC 
SO WE'VE GOT MORE RISK AND MORE EXPOSURE 
THE INTEREST WHICH WE'VE HAD TO DATE AND TO WORK THE PLANNING TICKET WITH IS FROM AN ASSISTED LIVING PROVIDER 
WHICH MEANS THAT PROVIDER WILL TAKE THE WHOLE FORTY UNITS OFF US IN ONE LOT 
IT ALL SOUNDS GREAT BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN TERMS OF COST AND PROFIT 
I INVITED A LOCAL ESTATE AGENT TO COME AND GIVE US AN OPINION 
ON THE PLANS AND THEIR VALUE ONCE COMPLETED 
I THINK THE PLANS ARE REALLY GOOD 
THEY CERTAINLY WORK WELL WITH THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND THERE'S A MARKET WITH ASSISTED ACCOMMODATION 
SO WITH DEMAND FOR THIS TYPE OF HOUSING STRONG 
HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO OWN ONE OF THESE APARTMENTS WITH ON SITE CARE FACILITIES 
IF WE WERE PUTTING ONE OF THESE RESIDENTIAL UNITS ON THE MARKET 
ONE WOULD BE SUGGESTING ASKING PRICES OF ANYWHERE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
DEPENDING ON SIZE AND SPECIFICATION 
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A MATHEMATICIAN TO KNOW THAT IS A LOT BUT LET ME DO THE MATHS FOR YOU 
FORTY APARTMENTS AT THE LOWER PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND WOULD MEAN A TOTAL SALE PRICE OF ABOUT SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION 
AND A TOP FIGURE OF ABOUT EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION 
IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL HOW MUCH THE FINISHED DEVELOPMENT WILL BE SOLD FOR 
BUT AS THEY PAID JUST ONE POINT TWO THREE MILLION FOR THE LAND 
AND MANAGED TO GET PLANNING APPROVAL I THINK WE CAN SAFELY SAY IT'S BEEN AN EXCELLENT INVESTMENT 
CHARLIE DID A FANTASTIC JOB OF PURCHASING THIS SITE FOR THE COMPANY 
IT GIVES US A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES AND HOPEFULLY WE'VE FOUND THE RIGHT ONE 
ONCE THIS BUILDING IS COMPLETE IT'LL BE SOLD EN MASSE TO THE ASSISTED CARE HOME PROVIDER 
WHO WILL THEN SELL THE INDIVIDUAL UNITS 
IT'LL BE AT LEAST ANOTHER SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE THEY'RE ALL FINISHED 
BUT FOR JULIAN AND HIS EMPLOYERS IT'S ALL TURNED OUT RATHER WELL 
TIME TO RETURN TO GRAVESEND TO SEE HOW STEVE IS GETTING ON DEVELOPING THESE TWO GARAGES AND YARD 
HE BOUGHT THEM AT AUCTION FOR SIXTY ONE THOUSAND 
STEVE A LOCAL BUILDER KNOWS THE SITE WELL 
BUT HE WAS FAR FROM A PROUD OWNER 
DID YOU EVER THINK THEY'RE GONNA BE MINE ONE DAY I WANT TWO BIG HOUSES THERE 
NO I JUST THOUGHT WHAT A DIVE 
BUT TALKING OF DIVES HE MIGHT BE DIVING INTO THE DEEP END WITH THIS 
BECAUSE IT'S HIS FIRST PROPERTY DEVELOPING ENTERPRISE 
AND I JUST THOUGHT IT'S ABOUT TIME I SORT OF DONE SOMETHING FOR MYSELF 
I WANT TO EARN THE MONEY OUT OF IT AND SO HERE WE ARE 
IF HE GETS PLANNING APPROVAL HE'S HOPING TO BUILD TWO SEMI DETACHED COTTAGES OR ONE FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE 
BUT I HAVE TO SAY I THOUGHT HE WAS VERY UNREALISTIC ABOUT THE TIME IT TAKES TO GET PLANNING PERMISSION 
HOPEFULLY START BUILDING IN SORT OF TWO MONTHS POSSIBLY TEN WEEKS' TIME 
TWO MONTHS TO GET PLANNING PERMISSION 
IF HE ACHIEVES THAT I'LL EAT MY HANDBAG 
SO LET'S FIND OUT HOW HE GOT ON 
WE'RE RETURNING A FULL SIX MONTHS LATER BY WHICH TIME 
ACCORDING TO STEVE'S ESTIMATES THE PROPERTY SHOULD BE BUILT 
WELL THERE'S GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS 
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THE SITE HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED 
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT MY HANDBAG IS SAFE 
EVERYTHING LOOKS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME 
SO WHAT'S GONE WRONG 
SINCE YOU WAS LAST HERE NOT A GREAT DEAL'S HAPPENED TO BE HONEST AS REGARDS TO THE PLOT 
BUT PLANNING PERMISSION'S BEEN GOING THROUGH THE NECESSARY CHANNELS 
THE COUNCIL ACTUALLY REFUSED PLANNING PERMISSION FOR THE SEMI DETACHED PROPERTIES WE WAS PROPOSING 
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN A LOT OF RED TAPE SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED 
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TRYING TO MAXIMISE OUR POTENTIAL 
SO THE TWO PROPERTIES WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREATER PROFIT MARGIN 
STEVE'S HOPES MAY HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY DAMPENED BUT HE'S STILL OPTIMISTIC 
I THINK WE'LL MORE THAN LIKELY GO FOR A SINGLE DWELLING POSSIBLY THREE OR FOUR BEDROOMED PROPERTY 
IT WILL BE MORE IN KEEPING WITH THE LOCAL AREA AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL GO DOWN THAT ROUTE 
ME AND THE ARCHITECT ARE GETTING ON GREAT AND JUST TRYING TO GET THE PLANS PASSED REALLY 
JUST BE HAPPY TO GET STARTED ON THE WORK 
SO WITH PLAN A REJECTED STEVE IS NOW FOCUSING ON PLAN B. 
THERE'S A ONE BEDROOM AND A TWO BEDROOM FLAT 
HERE'S THE MAIN ENTRANCE FOR THE GROUND FLOOR FLAT 
LIVING ROOM DINING ROOM KITCHEN LEADING TO THE GARDEN 
IT'LL BE A SHARED GARDEN THERE 
STAIRS FOR THE TWO BEDROOM FLAT 
LOUNGE DINER KITCHEN SAME LAYOUT REALLY AS DOWNSTAIRS 
APART FROM TWO BEDROOMS IN THE LOFT SPACE 
AGAIN PARKING WAS AN ISSUE BUT WE'VE MANAGED TO HOPEFULLY PLEASE THE COUNCIL WITH THAT 
BUT AS I SAY FAILING THIS WE WILL GO FOR A SINGLE THREE OR FOUR BED DWELLING 
AS STEVE EVEN HAS A PLAN C. IN THE PIPELINE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT HE'S DETERMINED TO SUCCEED 
HE AND HAS PARTNER RAISED THE SIXTY ONE THOUSAND TO BUY THE SITE BY REMORTGAGING THEIR EXISTING HOME LOAN 
SO FAR THEY'VE BEEN PAYING EXTRA INTEREST FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS 
STILL RESOURCEFUL STEVE DID MANAGE TO CLAW BACK SOME OF THE MONEY 
WELL LUCKILY ENOUGH WE'VE MANAGED TO RENT EACH GARAGE OUT SINCE LAST TIME 
THIS ONE'S BEEN USED FOR STORAGE AND THERE'S A VEHICLE IN THAT ONE 
SO THAT'S BRINGING IN EIGHTY A MONTH 
SOMETHING TO GO TOWARDS THE COST 
ALTHOUGH BEHIND WITH THE SCHEDULE HOW HAS THE BUDGET FARED 
I'VE LITERALLY SPENT WHAT WE SPENT AT THE AUCTION WHICH WAS SIXTY ONE THOUSAND 
AND THE ARCHITECT'S FEES WHICH IS JUST OVER FIVE HUNDRED AT THE MOMENT 
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SPEND ANY MORE MONEY TO BE HONEST 
STEVE STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE HE FINALLY GETS APPROVAL FROM THE LOCAL COUNCIL 
SO DID HE MAKE A MISTAKE BUYING THE SITE WITHOUT ANY PLANNING PERMISSION WHATSOEVER 
OR MIGHT THE GARAGES STILL BE A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT 
THE BEST PEOPLE TO ASK ARE TWO LOCAL AGENTS 
THE FLATS ARE A VERY GOOD SIZE FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN ON THE PLANS 
BOTH THE ONE BEDROOM AND THE TWO BEDROOM WOULD BE AN IDEAL DWELLING FOR A SINGLE OR A COUPLE 
HE WOULD BENEFIT FROM BUILDING FLATS ON THIS PLOT OF LAND 
BUT HE'LL PROBABLY GET PLANNING PERMISSION MORE FOR A HOUSE AS THERE ARE HOUSES AND NO OTHER FLATS HERE 
THIS IS A VERY BUSY ROAD YOU'VE GOT PARKING ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ROAD 
IT IS VERY TOUGH TO GET VEHICLES DOWN SO IT IS PRETTY ESSENTIAL TO HAVE OFF ROAD PARKING 
THEY HAVE GOT PLANS FOR OFF ROAD PARKING AND THE LAYOUT OF THE PROPERTIES DO LOOK VERY GOOD 
PLANNING ON THIS PLOT IS VERY VERY LIKELY WE'RE IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA 
AS WE LOOK AROUND WE CAN SEE HOUSES THAT ARE AROUND US AND I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT HE WILL GET PLANNING 
IF IT'S NOT FOR FLATS THEN FOR ONE RESIDENTIAL DWELLING 
THAT SOUNDS GOOD FOR STEVE BUT WILL HE MAKE A PROFIT ON HIS FIRST VENTURE 
SO FAR HE'S SPENT AROUND SIXTY TWO THOUSAND BECAUSE HE'S INVESTIGATING SO MANY BUILDING OPTIONS 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SET A BUILD COST PRICE BUT IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE BELOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
SO HOW MUCH COULD THE VARIOUS OPTIONS BE WORTH 
A TWO BEDROOMED FLAT WOULD PROBABLY SELL IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
AND A ONE BEDROOM FLAT WOULD PROBABLY SELL BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THE TWO BEDROOM FLAT WOULD SELL AROUND ABOUT THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
WITH THE ONE BEDROOM GOING AROUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
SO HE COULD JUST ABOUT MAKE HIS MONEY BACK ON THE FLATS BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE HOUSES 
A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE WOULD PROBABLY SELL IN THE REGION OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
A FOUR BEDROOM ON THIS ROAD WOULD SELL AT AROUND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
I'M REALLY PLEASED TO BE HONEST ABOUT THE PRICES OF FLATS 
IT'S MORE THAN I'VE BEEN QUOTED SO FAR 
I WAS QUOTED SORT OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN FOR A SINGLE AND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FOR THE TWO BED SO THAT'S MORE THAN I EXPECTED TO BE HONEST 
THAT'S GREAT AND ON THE PRICE OF THE FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE 
I WASN'T SURE TO BE HONEST 
WITH THIS PARTICULAR AREA OF THE TOTAL COST OF THE THREE OR FOUR BED DETACHED PROPERTY 
BUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE UPWARDS TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THAT'S REALLY GOOD NEWS 
SEE YOU NEXT TIME FOR MORE AUCTION PROPERTIES ON HOMES UNDER THE HAMMER JOIN US THEN GOODBYE BYE
