YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN ZOE DO THIS 
BRILLIANT HER HAND IS OFF AS WELL 
OH DEAR ME 
WHAT A DAREDEVIL TODAY IT'S YOUR TURN FEELING BRAVE 
I AM YEAH ARE YOU THAT MAKES A FIRST COME ON 
ON TODAY'S BLUE PETER ANDY IS PUSHED TO THE EDGE 
LOOK AT THAT NASTY GASH 
AND CATCH ME IN THE DEEP FREEZE 
WE'RE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE BECAUSE TODAY'S CHALLENGE IS SO BIG 
IT WOULDN'T FIT IN THE STUDIO YOU READY FOR THIS I THINK SO 
TAKE IT AWAY GUYS 
DO YOUR THING BY BASEMENT JAXX 
THAT'S PHENOMENAL ISN'T IT IT'S A BIT SCARY THOUGH 
IT IS A BIT SCARY LET ME KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE LATER 
ANDY WILL ATTEMPT SOME MOVES ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE 
BEFORE HE TAKES OFF LET'S FIND OUT MORE ABOUT IT 
NEARLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO A YOUNG FRENCH MAN CALLED JULES LEOTARD WAS BORED 
SO HE DECIDED TO PLAY IN HIS PARENTS' SWIMMING POOL 
SWINGING ON CABLES FROM THE ROOF 
ONE DAY HE ATTACHED A BAR TO THE CABLES 
AND THE FLYING TRAPEZE WAS BORN 
WOW 
HE BECAME SO GOOD AT TRICKS 
HE ENDED UP PERFORMING AT A CIRCUS IN PARIS 
NOW JULES LEOTARD NEEDED A TIGHT FITTING COSTUME FOR HIS ACT 
HE NAMED IT AFTER HIMSELF THE LEOTARD 
THE NEXT TIME YOU HAVE TO WEAR ONE YOU'LL KNOW WHERE IT COMES FROM 
H. M. M. I AM NOT WEARING A LEOTARD 
AND AS LONG AS I DON'T HAVE TO SWING OVER A POOL I'LL BE ALL RIGHT 
I CAN'T PROMISE YOU EITHER OF THOSE THINGS I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS 
DANNY AND LISA WILL SHOW YOU A HOCKS OFF CATCH 
WHICH IS WHAT YOU'LL ATTEMPT LATER DANNY OVER TO YOU MY FRIEND 
O. K. DANNY HAS TO GET INTO POSITION 
GET SOME MOMENTUM GOING AND HOPEFULLY HE'LL CATCH LISA 
IN MID AIR 
OVER TO THE EXPERTS 
YEAH 
LOCKED ON AND SAFE WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S NOT BAD 
GOT THAT IN YOU I THINK I NEED TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT 
I THINK YOU NEED A FEW WORDS WITH THEM GOOD LUCK 
A FEW WEEKS AGO I TRIED EXTREME RUGBY 
IN THE FREEZING TEMPERATURES OF THE ARCTIC 
BEFORE I LEFT THE SNOW THERE'S ONE MORE THING I HAD TO DO 
I COULDN'T COME TO FINLAND WITHOUT SEEING SOME REINDEER 
I'M MEETING A FAMILY I'VE BEEN TOLD CAN HELP ME OUT 
HI THERE HOW ARE YOU DOING HELLO I'M GETHIN NICE TO MEET YOU 
MY NAME IS KIRSI NICE TO MEET YOU AND WELCOME I'M PETRI 
AND HELLO TO YOU AS WELL THIS IS PIETARI 
WHERE ARE THE REINDEER I COULDN'T SEE ANY OUTSIDE IN THE FOREST 
I'VE COME TO A VILLAGE NEAR INARI IN NORTHERN FINLAND 
AT OVER TWO HUNDRED MILES INSIDE THE ARCTIC CIRCLE 
THERE'S SNOW EVERYWHERE FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR 
PETRI IS ONE OF THE SAMI PEOPLE THE NATIVE POPULATION OF THIS AREA 
FOR GENERATIONS HIS FAMILY HAVE FARMED REINDEER HERE FOR MEAT 
FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS I WAS GONNA BE HELPING OUT 
HOW MANY REINDEER DO WE HAVE TO FEED TODAY ONE HUNDRED 
READY 
O. K. LET'S GO 
IT WAS A TWENTY MINUTE RIDE TO THE REINDEER 
AND I WAS LOVING IT FRESH AIR STUNNING SCENERY 
AND A LOAD OF SOFT HAY BRILLIANT 
JUST FOR TONIGHT BY ONE NIGHT ONLY 
WE NEED FOOD TO KEEP US GOING SO WE STOPPED AT PETRI'S MEAT DRYING CAGE 
TO COLLECT SOME DRIED REINDEER MEAT 
IT'S A REAL DELICACY IN FINLAND 
TELL ME THE PROCESS OF DRYING THE MEAT 
THEY ARE ONE DAY IN SALT THEN I PUT IT SIX WEEKS IN HERE 
AND THEY ARE READY SO ONE DAY IN SALT AND DRIED FOR SIX WEEKS YES 
THE COLD AIR DRIES THE MEAT 
AND MAKES IT EDIBLE WITHOUT NEEDING TO COOK IT 
IT'S ROCK SOLID 
OFF TO MEET THE REINDEER 
OH 
IT'S LUNCHTIME 
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING 
CAN YOU I KNOW YOU SAID THAT DOES IT MEAN ANYTHING 
NO NO DO IT AGAIN 
HE'S HAVING A WEE 
O. K. THAT'S GOOD LOOK THEY ARE COMING 
IT WORKED 
WE WERE COLLECTING THE REINDEER TOGETHER BEFORE USING HAY 
TO LEAD THEM TO A FRESH GRAZING SITE 
TIME TO GO YEAH YES I THINK SO 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN AGES TO MOVE ALL THOSE REINDEER 
BUT THEY WERE KEEN TO FOLLOW WHEN THEY KNEW THERE WAS A BIG SLEDGE 
FULL OF HAY ON OFFER 
MY JOB IS TO KEEP DROPPING HAY EVERY TWENTY OR THIRTY METRES OR SO 
TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO KEEP COMING TO THE NEW LOCATION 
IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING 
OR MAYBE THEY LIKED THE WAY IT WAS SERVED 
EITHER WAY WE MADE IT TO THE NEW LOCATION QUICKLY 
NICE AND CLEAN NO DROPPINGS 
AND THERE'S NO WORRY OF OVER GRAZING 
AND AFTER ALL THAT EFFORT AND BELIEVE YOU ME IT WAS HARD WORK 
PETRI'S WIFE KIRSI WAS ON HAND WITH REFRESHMENTS 
YOU'VE GOT THE DRIED REINDEER MEAT THANK YOU 
MM THIS IT'S A BIT LIKE BEEF IT'S QUITE CHEWY VERY TASTY 
CHEERS EVERYBODY CHEERS THANK YOU

HE'S QUITE NERVOUS ACTUALLY 
WHILST HE'S BUSY DOING THAT LET'S CATCH UP WITH A BLUE PETER VIEWER 
AND FIND OUT MORE ABOUT MAIA 
HI I'M MAIA AND I LIVE ON A CANAL BOAT 
THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING ME 
COME ABOARD AND I'LL SHOW YOU MY BOAT 
THIS IS MY BATHROOM 
THIS IS MY BEDROOM 
THIS IS THE KITCHEN 
AND I LIVE HERE WITH MY FAMILY 
MY CAT HAZEL MY STEP DAD SCOTT MY MUM AND MY BABY SISTER PRIMROSE 
I LIKE CRUISING THE BOAT WITH SCOTT 
BECAUSE YOU SEE LOTS OF WILDLIFE AND IT'S REALLY SUNNY A LOT OF THE TIME 
HORSES ARE MY FAVOURITE ANIMALS BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THEM 
AND I CAN NEIGH LIKE THEM 
IS IT ON 
HELLO 
THIS IS MY RAG DOLL HER NAME'S ISABEL 
THERE'S HAZEL HAZEL 
I'M GOING TO SLEEP NOW 
IF WE'RE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SCHOOL I USUALLY CYCLE 
BUT IF WE'RE QUITE FAR AWAY THEN I GET THE TRAIN OR A BUS 
PEOPLE AT MY SCHOOL THINK IT'S SPECIAL TO LIVE ON A CANAL BOAT 
SOMETIMES I CAN FEEL THAT ACTUALLY IT REALLY IS SPECIAL 
AND I FEEL REALLY DIFFERENT FROM EVERYONE ELSE 
I LIVE ON A BOAT SOME OF THE TIME BUT 
I CAN'T THINK OF ANY BECAUSE I LOVE LIVING ON A BOAT SO MUCH 
HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN FIT ON THE BOAT 
LAST TIME WE GOT AS MUCH PEOPLE ON THE BOAT AS WE COULD 
IT WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN BUT THAT WAS WHEN WE WERE ALL SITTING DOWN 
AND COMFORTABLE IF WE SQUASHED EVERYONE IN TOGETHER 
WE'D FIT ABOUT TWENTY 
DO YOU EVER FEEL SEASICK 
LOTS OF PEOPLE SAY THEY DO WHEN THEY COME ON THE BOAT 
BUT I HAVEN'T FELT IT BEFORE 
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED SEEING MY HOME 
THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING ME 
THANKS MAIA I'M SURE THE VIEW IS MORE PLEASANT FOR YOU THAN ANDY 
BECAUSE HE'S HOVERING AT NINE METRES IN THE AIR 
AT THE TOP OF THE TRAPEZE BOARD 
THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW 
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE UP THERE DON'T CRY 
IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT WHEN I WAS TRAINING I WAS INDOORS 
AND YOU HAD WALLS THAT MADE YOU FEEL SECURE 
BUT OUTSIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRYSIDE IT'S A LOT HIGHER 
I'M FEELING YOUR NERVES FROM DOWN HERE 
BUT DON'T WORRY WE HAVE SOME TIPS FOR YOU 
WE'VE GOT SOME YOUNG TRAPEZE ARTISTS TO GIVE ANDY SOME HELP 
SO HE CAN FLY LIKE A BIRD 
ANDY FACE YOUR FEAR 
AND BE READY FOR IT 
STRAIGHT ARMS 
THE MORE YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE SCARIER IT GETS SO JUST DO IT 
ANDY POINT YOUR TOES 
TRUST YOUR PARTNER 
GO TO THE SWING 
ANDY DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE HEIGHT 
JUST CONCENTRATE ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
I LOVE THAT ADVICE 
THE MORE YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE MORE SCARED YOU BECOME 
SO I'M JUST GONNA GO FOR IT GOOD ADVICE 
THAT'S GOOD ADVICE FOR A LOT OF THINGS ON BLUE PETER 
NOW MIKE HE'S GOT THE SAFETY NET BUT HE'S GOT NO HARNESS 
IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS THING TO DO 
IT IS THE NET CAN BE YOUR BEST FRIEND BUT CAN ALSO BE AN ENEMY 
IF YOU DON'T LAND CORRECTLY YOU CAN DAMAGE BONES TEAR FINGERS 
ALL SORTS OF NASTY WE DON'T WANT THAT 
SO TALK THROUGH ANDY WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO 
HE NEEDS TO CONCENTRATE ON THE THINGS WE'VE PRACTISED 
COME OFF THE BOARD CLEANLY A NICE SWING 
WE'LL FIND THE END OF THE SWING ON A PRACTICE SWING 
WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER PRACTICE SWING I'LL GIVE HIM THE CALL 
ON THE THIRD ONE WE'LL ASK HIM TO LET GO 
AND HE SHOULD FALL NICE AND GENTLY FLAT ON HIS BACK IN THE NET 
O. K. ANDY YOU READY YEAH 
OVER TO MIKE THEN TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S SAFE 
O. K. ANDY ON MY CALL JUST NICE AND CALM 
THREE TWO ONE UP 
O. K. WAIT FOR IT 
AND LEGS GO BACK FRONT 
BACK FRONT 
THIS'LL BE THE POINT ON THE NEXT ONE WAIT FOR IT 
WAIT FOR MY CALL 
HUP 
OH YES 
THE DISMOUNT WAS QUESTIONABLE BUT I ENJOYED THAT 
THAT LOOKED FUN THE DISMOUNT 
MIKE HOW WAS THAT THAT LOOKED SO PROFESSIONAL 
HE WAS REALLY GOOD HE LISTENED TO EVERYTHING WE SAID 
LANDED FLAT ON HIS BACK GOOD MAN 
I'M NOT SURE HE LANDED FLAT ON HIS BACK BECAUSE HE'S LOST HIS BADGE 
IT WAS DEFINITELY ON HIS FRONT 
RIGHT GOOD FOR NOW THE CATCH IS LATER 
THAT'S THE BIG ONE THE CATCH BUT BEFORE THAT 
BEFORE I LEFT THE SNOW IN THE ARCTIC 
I WAS CATCHING SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WELL DONE MATE 
I WAS IN NORTHERN FINLAND TO SEE IF I HAD WHAT IT TOOK 
TO BE A RANGER HERDER 
BUT THERE WERE LOTS OF TASKS STILL TO DO INCLUDING FINDING OUR DINNER 
WHAT AM I GONNA CATCH WITH THAT 
COULD I DO IT 
WE SET OFF ON OUR SNOWMOBILES TO CHECK ON ANOTHER GROUP OF REINDEER 
A FEW MILES AWAY 
WOO 
MOST OF PETRI'S REINDEER ARE FEMALE 
AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THEY'RE PREGNANT 
SO IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ALL HEALTHY 
PETRI'S NOTICED A FEW OF THE REINDEER NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION 
BECAUSE OF PARASITES LIVING IN THEIR BODY 
I HAVE TO STAY HERE AND BE QUIET 
BECAUSE ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENT CAN SCARE THEM OFF 
I HAVE TO WAIT FOR HIM TO CATCH ONE AND THEN I CAN RUN IN 
HE'S GOT ONE 
LASSOING THE REINDEER DOESN'T HURT THEM 
AND IT MEANS THEY CAN BE GIVEN THEIR MEDICINE QUICKLY 
WE HAD TO ACT FAST SO THE REINDEER DIDN'T BECOME TOO STRESSED 
HOLD THE BOTTOM OF THE ANTLERS 
I HELD HER STEADY WHILE PETRI ADMINISTERED THE MEDICINE 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT SCARED OBVIOUSLY 
SHE NEEDS HER MEDICINE 
IT'S O. K. TO LET GO 
THERE YOU GO 
THAT WAS REALLY EXCITING 
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP ANY TIME 
PETRI OFTEN HAS TO SLEEP OUT WITH THE REINDEER 
AND TONIGHT HE LET ME EXPERIENCE IT TOO 
MIND YOU RIGHT NOW WE WEREN'T GOING ANYWHERE 
YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY DON'T YOU 
GUTTED 
YEAH WHATEVER I KNEW THAT SWITCH WAS OFF 
WE'D BE SLEEPING IN A TRADTIONAL TENT CALLED A TEEPEE 
BUT FIRST WE HAD TO CLEAR THE SNOW 
OH THIS IS RIDICULOUS 
TIME TO PUT UP THE FRAME 
NOW LIKE ANY TENT THEY NEED A CANVAS 
THE DOOR NEEDS TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT HAD A DOOR 
GREAT JOB I LOVE IT 
THERE'S NO ROOF NO BECAUSE WE ARE HERE IN FIRE AND THAT'S VERY WARM 
OF COURSE THE FIRE GOES AND IT KEEPS IT WARM ALL NIGHT 
WHAT'S FOR DINNER I'M HUNGRY NOW 
FISH FISH 
WHERE FROM I HAVEN'T SEEN A SHOP FOR MILES AND THE LAKES ARE FROZEN 
O. K. COME WITH ME 
FISH 
BUT EVEN WITH FROZEN LAKES PETRI TOLD ME WE COULD STILL CATCH FISH 
BY DRILLING A HOLE IN THE ICE 
PETRI TELLS ME THE ICE IS ABOUT A METRE THICK 
WE'LL SEE 
AND HOPEFULLY UNDERNEATH IT 
THERE'LL BE SOME FISH 
A LITTLE BIT MORE 
O. K. THAT'S GOOD 
I HELP YEAH 
THANKING YOU 
WHAT AM I GONNA CATCH WITH THAT 
IT'S THE SMALLEST FISHING ROD I'VE EVER SEEN 
GOT A MAGGOT FOR BAIT 
LET'S SEE WHAT WE CATCH 
PETRI THIS IS NOT SOME KIND OF FINNISH JOKE IS IT 
NO 
WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA CATCH SOMETHING OF COURSE 
GOOD LUCK SEE YOU IN THE TEEPEE 
YOU'RE LEAVING ME HERE 
I HOPE THERE'S NO BEARS AND WOLVES ABOUT 
I FAILED TO CATCH ANY FISH 
AND WASN'T LOOKING FORWARD TO TELLING PETRI 
PETRI 
COOL 
HEY 
I'VE BEEN OUT THERE AGES 
I'M SO SORRY I DIDN'T CATCH ANY FISH 
NO FISH NO FISH 
WHAT ARE WE GONNA EAT WE HAVE REINDEER 
GREAT 
WE LOVE A MAN WHO'S GOT A PLAN 
I HAD SUCH A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP IN THAT TEEPEE 
THE FIRE BURNING ALL NIGHT I WAS NICE AND TOASTY 
AND I'M PRETTY HOT NOW HAVING FUN IN THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE 
BUT I'M NOT SURE ANDY IS BECAUSE HE'S BEEN GEARING UP 
FOR HIS CATCH ON THE TRAPEZE ANDY HOW IS IT 
IT MIGHT LOOK A BIT WEIRD BUT THIS IS REALLY GOOD FUN 
I'M FEELING A BIT NERVOUS NOW EVEN THOUGH I'VE PRACTISED IT 
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY CAUGHT ANYONE YET 
SO IT'LL BE TRICKY TO SEE HOW THIS GOES 
MIKE THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO GIVE HIM SOME LAST MINUTE ADVICE 
ANDY ALL THE STUFF WE DID EARLIER ON 
WHERE YOU SWING OUT AND DROP TO THE NET AT THE END OF THE SWING 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR ON THE CATCH 
NICE AND HARD WORK THE SWING HARD 
WAIT FOR THE END OF THE CALL 
AND WHEN I CALL JUST STICK YOUR HANDS OUT 
AND LET THE CATCHER DO HIS JOB GOOD LUCK 
O. K. HERE WE GO 
O. K. ANDY UP THE LADDER YOU GO 
HE'S GOT A FAIR JOURNEY UP TO THE TOP 
AND WHEN HE GETS THERE HE WILL JUMP OFF THE TOP ONTO THE TRAPEZE 
WHEN HE'S TOLD TO DO SO 
AND WHILST HE'S DOING THAT DANNY WILL BE ON THE OTHER TRAPEZE 
HE'S IN POSITION ALL RIGHT DANNY LOVELY STUFF 
AND THIS IS ALL ABOUT TIMING IF THE TIMING IS RIGHT IT WILL GO WELL 
IF THE TIMING IS BAD IT COULD BE VERY VERY DANGEROUS 
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULDN'T DO IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TRAINED 
ANDY'S GETTING HARNESSED IN NOW HE'S GOT THE SAFTEY GEAR ON
