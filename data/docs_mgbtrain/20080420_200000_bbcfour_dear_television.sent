JUKEBOX JURY AS SUCH HAS NO INTEREST FOR ME 
BUT IT'S A FASCINATING OCCUPATION TO WATCH THE FACES OF THE AUDIENCE 
AND FIT THEM INTO HISTORICAL PERIOD DRESS FOR EXAMPLE TUDOR STEWART GEORGIAN VICTORIAN AND MODERN 
IT'S SURPRISING HOW MANY SEEM TO SUIT THE EARLY PERIOD 
EE I. EE I. OH 
HAVE OTHER VIEWERS TRIED THIS 
DEAR TELEVISION IT IS DISTURBING THAT THE B. B. C. HAS SEEN FIT TO TELEVISE A SERIES ON ASTROLOGY 
TO ME IT'S COMPLETE NONSENSE AND MY LUCKY NUMBER IS SEVEN 
DABBLING IN THE OCCULT CAN BE A DANGEROUS ACTIVITY 
I DON'T LIKE THAT ONE 
SO IT COULD BE ONE OF THIRTY OR FORTY 
I DON'T KNOW 
I WANT TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION YET I'M NOT SURE I COULD BE OVER HERE 
PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED MENTAL ILLNESS SOMETIMES LEADING TO SUICIDE AFTER SUCH PURSUITS 
TAKING ASTROLOGY SERIOUSLY CAN BE THE FIRST STEP TO THIS 
HE SEEMS TO LOVE CLIMBING HE'S MAKING ME GO TO TERRIBLE HEIGHTS HERE AND I'M QUITE FRIGHTENED 
IT IS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE B. B. C.'S LURCH INTO TRIVIALITY THAT THE VIRTUAL DEMISE OF PROGRAMMES ABOUT RELIGION 
HAS COINCIDED WITH THE ONSET OF THIS PARTICULAR SERIES 
I THINK HE'S A FUNNY PERSON FUNNY YES 
THERE'S A PIXIE ISH QUALITY IN HIS CHART 
AN AGELESS QUALITY AS WELL AN AGELESS PIXIE 
MY HUSBAND AND I WERE DRIVEN TO FURY WHILE WATCHING TOMORROW'S WORLD 
WE HAVE IN THE PAST BEEN IRRITATED BY THE TRIVIAL APPROACH ADOPTED IN THIS SERIES 
THE PRESENTERS APPEAR TO TALK DOWN TO US 
AND SEEMS UNABLE TO PERFORM THE DEMONSTRATIONS I'M ABOUT TO DIP THIS SHEEP 
BECAUSE ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN 
THE SIGHT OF THE LADY STRUGGLING WITH THE SHEEP WAS UTTER NONSENSE 
AND IF YOU TOP UP THE DIP EVERY SO OFTEN WITH WATER 
NOT ONLY WAS SHE LESS COHERENT THAN NECESSARY WITH HER STRUGGLES WITH THE ANIMAL 
BUT IT WAS PUT THROUGH QUITE UNNECESSARY STRESS AND SUFFERING IN A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT 
GO ON OUT YOU GO 
THEN 
I AM JUST AN ORDINARY HOUSEWIFE WITH AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE 
YET I AM QUITE CAPABLE OF LISTENING TO A LUCID EXPLANATION WITHOUT SUCH BANAL AND CLUMSY ILLUSTRATIONS 
FOR THIS SHEEP AT LEAST IT'S BACK IN THE BATH 
DEAR TELEVISION 
AS A MUSIC LOVER I HAD LOOKED FORWARD ALL WEEK TO THE PROGRAMME ON SIMON RATTLE 
HOWEVER I WAS FORCED TO SWITCH OFF IN DISGUST 
NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN SUCH BEHAVIOUR ON A ROSTRUM 
WHY DOES SIMON RATTLE FEEL IT NECESSARY TO PERFORM LIKE THIS 
GREAT CONDUCTORS SUCH AS ADRIAN BOLT MALCOLM SARGEANT JOHN BARBIROLLI AND HERBERT VON KARAJAN 
CAN COMMAND THE ORCHESTRA WITH LITTLE OR NO FACIAL EXPRESSION 
WHO IS EXCITING TO WATCH 
CONDUCTS WITHOUT A BATON 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE FINAL OF MASTERMIND NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE 
WHICH COMES FROM OXFORD UNIVERSITY 
THE CONTESTANTS ON MASTERMIND MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER CONSIDERABLE STRESS 
WHICH COLLECTION OF POEMS BY VERLAINE WAS INSPIRED BY THE COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE 
BY OBSERVING THE PULSATIONS OF THE CAROTID ARTERY IN THE NECK 
I'D ASSESS THAT MANY HEARTS WERE BEATING AT THE RATE OF ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PER MINUTE 
MOLIERE'S NO THE FABLES OF LA FONTAINE 
THE LADY FINALIST'S HEART WAS PALPITATING AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT 
THERE WERE TWO MEDICI POPES NAME ONE 
ALEXANDER THE FOURTH NO CLEMENT OR LEO 
THE NORMAL HEART RATE IS ABOUT SEVENTY BEATS PER MINUTE 
BY WHAT NAME IS THE MOUNTAIN CHOMOLUNGMA BETTER KNOWN 
POPOCATEPETL NO EVEREST 
DEAR TELEVISION I WATCHED LAST WEEK'S SOFTLY SOFTLY 
IN WHICH TWO YOUNG CHILDREN WERE CRYING MOST REALISTICALLY 
AND OBVIOUSLY DISTRESSED THEY'RE VERY INTELLIGENT 
THEY WERE MUCH TOO YOUNG TO BE ACTING THE PART WHAT'S THIS 
WE'VE OFTEN DISCUSSED IN THE FAMILY THIS QUESTION OF YOUNG CHILDREN CRYING ON SCREEN 
AND WE CAN'T HELP WONDERING HOW THIS IS ACHIEVED IT'S DISTURBING IF THESE CHILDREN ARE GOADED INTO THIS STATE 
MUMMY MUMMY'S GOING TO MAKE YOUR ORANGE 
AS A NURSING STUDENT WHO'S CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELFARE OF YOUNG CHILDREN 
I'D LIKE SOME REASSURANCE THAT NO MENTAL OR PHYSICAL CRUELTY IS USED FOR THIS PURPOSE MAMMA 
THIS IS B. B. C. ONE 
WELCOME TO LONDON 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN MISS WORLD NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN 
BOTTOM MARKS FOR THE PRESENTATION OF B. B. C. ONE'S MISS WORLD PROGRAMME 
THIS BEAUTY CONTEST COVERS EVERY ASPECT OF A GIRL'S APPEARANCE 
FACE HAIR LEGS PERSONALITY 
SO OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO GET A CLOSE UP LOOK AT ALL THE GIRL NOT JUST HER FACE 
ONTO ROUND FOUR THE FINAL FIFTEEN 
THIS TIME IN SWIMSUITS WAHEY HEY 
THE CAMERA TEAM GAVE US ONE LONG SHOT OF EACH GIRL AS SHE APPROACHED 
THEN SKIPPED TO A FACE AND NECK CLOSE UP AND NOTHING ELSE 
FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A LOT OF FRIGHTENED RABBITS 
NOT DARING TO LET VIEWERS SEE THE GIRL FULLY FOR FEAR OF HAVING THEIR KNUCKLES RAPPED 
BY SOME MID VICTORIAN CRANKS 
THIRTY SIX TWENTY THREE THIRTY SIX 
TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR YOU WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A DRILL 
THE SORT OF SERVICE WE SHOULD HAVE GOT FROM THE CAMERA TEAM IS FIRST A LONG SHOT OF EACH GIRL 
THERE WE ARE A LEFT PROFILE EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE RIGHT I'VE SEEN MOST OF THE CURVES 
THEN A STEADY UNHURRIED SWEEP WITH THE TELESCOPIC LENS 
THAT'S WHAT IT'S THERE FOR 
A VERY INTERESTING LINE UP YOU MUST SAY 
WHO WAS IT WHO SAID ALL GOOD THINGS MUST COME TO AN END
