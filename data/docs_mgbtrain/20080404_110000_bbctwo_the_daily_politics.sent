WELCOME TO THE DAILY POLITICS ON 
FRIDAY FRIDAY AS POLITICIANS HEAD POLISH WORKER 
LIVING IN LONDON AND FIND OUT WHAT 
MIGRANTS MADE OF THE LORDS' REPORT 
THIS WEEK WHO 
MAKE YOU SMARTER GILES HAS THE RUN DOWN OF YOUR TOP 
STORIES OF THE WEEK IN OUR 
POLITICAL POPS 
SO ALL OF THAT IN THE NEXT HALF AN 
HOUR WITH ME TODAY FOR THE WHOLE 
PROGRAMME ARE ANNE LESSY OF THE 
DAILY MAIL AND KEVIN MAGUIRE OF THE 
MIRROR MIRROR WELCOME TO YOU BOTH 
AS M. P.'S HEAD OFF FIRE THEIR RATHER 
BELATED EASTER RECESS AND WITH 
PROBLEMS MOUNTING IN WESTMINSTER 
THE PRIME MINISTER MIGHT JUST BE 
GLAD TO GET AWAY FOR A LITTLE BREAK 
ALTHOUGH I DOUBT HE WILL GO VIA 
HEATHROW TERMINAL FIVE FIRST AMONG 
HIS PROBLEMS ARE RUMBLINGS OF 
DISCONTENT AMONG LABOUR M. P.'S OVER 
HIS DECISION TO SCRAP THE TEN PENCE 
STARTING RATE OF INCOME TAX FORTY THREE M. P.'S 
HAVE SIGNED A COMMONS MOTION SAYING 
THAT THE MOVE IS HITTING LOW PAID 
FAMILIES HANDBAGS WERE DRAWN 
YESTERDAY WHEN THE PUBS MINISTER 
GERRY SUTCLIFFE CALLED ON THE 
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER TO 
CHANGE HIS MIND ABOUT THE RECENT 
TAX RISES ON ALCOHOL REMARKABLY 
HE WAS LATER FORCED TO RETRACT 
THOSE COMMENTS SAYING THEY DID 
NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT MY VIEWS 
EARLIER IN THE WEEK THE HEALTH 
MINISTER IVAN LEWIS CAUSED A RUCKUS 
WHEN HE SUGGESTED THAT LABOUR WAS 
OUT OF TOUCH AND HEADING FOR DEFEAT 
AT THE NEXT ELECTION 
KEVIN THE WOES ARE PILING UP IS 
THIS THE USUAL RUMBLINGS FROM THE 
USUAL SUSPECT FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE 
THAN THAT 
I THINK IT'S MORE 
SERIOUS BOTH GERRY SUTCLIFFE AND 
IVAN LEWIS ARE LOYAL MINISTERS 
THOSE M. P.'S WHO SIGNED THAT EARLY DAY 
MOTION PEOPLE LIKE GREG POPE AND 
KEVIN BARROW THEY'RE LOYALISTS TOO 
IT'S NOT THE USUAL SUSPECTS IN IN THAT CASE IS IT MORE SERIOUS I I THINK GORDON BROWN WILL BE WORRIED 
I THINK THE ECONOMY IS IN A 
DIFFICULT POSITION SO THAT'S WHY 
HE HAS PUT FOUR PENCE ON A PINT 
YOU COULD EXPLAIN THAT AWAY QUITE 
EASILY NOT CORRECTING THE CUT IN 
THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE I THOUGHT 
THAT WEE BE CORRECTED IN THE BUDGET 
BUT IT WASN'T HE HASN'T GOT MUCH 
MONEY TO DO IT HE IS KIND OF STUCK 
WITH IT FOR ANOTHER YEAR THAT 
WON'T GO AWAY PEOPLE WILL FEEL IT 
IN THEIR POCKETS PEOPLE ON LOWER 
THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THE TREASURY MINISTER 
THESE PEOPLE ARE FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR BETTER 
OFF THAN THEY WERE IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN BECAUSE 
OF THE CHANGES TRUTH IS THEY WILL 
HAVE A FEW POUNDS LESS IN THEIR 
POCKETS FROM NEXT WEEK 
ANNE WOULD 
IT BE RIGHT TO SURMISE THAT ALL OF 
THE RUMBLINGS IS COMING TO THE FORE 
NOW BECAUSE LABOUR ARE NOT DOING SO 
WELL IN THE POLLS AND M. P.'S ARE 
GETTING WORRIED ABOUT THEIR JOBS 
THEY'RE GETTING A BIT COCKY BUT 
NOT ENTIRELY COCKY AN AWFUL LOT OF 
THEM HAVE QUITE NARROW MAJORITIES 
IN THEIR SEATS IT'S ALMOST LIKE 
THE ZIMBABWE POLITBURO THEY'RE 
WONDERING WHICH WAY TO JUMP WHAT 
IS INTERESTING IS THAT WE ALWAYS 
WERE TOLD AND YOU ARE MUCH MORE 
MANUFACTURED THAN I AM ON THIS THAT 
GORDON BROWN GEORGE BROWN THAT'S 
INTERESTING 
THAT'S GOING BACK A INTERESTING FEW YEARS 
HE WAS A DRUNK WE WERE 
TOLD HE WAS A CONTROL FREAK BUT HE 
SEEMS TO HAVE LOST CONTROL OF HIS 
OWN PARTY THE BIG CLUNKING FIST 
KEEPS BOPPING HIMSELF IN THE NOSE 
IT'S VERY STUPID DECISIONS IT 
SEEMS TO ME THAT HE HAS SPENT ALL 
OF HIS ENERGY AND ALL OF HIS BRAINS 
AND ALL OF HIS SORT OF CONTROL 
FREAK INSTINCTS ON TRYING TO GET 
THE JOB WHEN HE GOT THE JOB HE 
CAN'T CONTROL THINGS CAN HE 
TALKING ABOUT CONTROL KEVIN THE 
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT RESULT 
WILL BE COMING OUT IN A COUPLE 
HOURS WE THINK IT WILL DETAIL 
GORDON BROWN'S EXPENSES DO YOU 
THINK THAT WILL BE DAMAGE FOR HIM 
IT WILL AT THE MOMENT POLITICIANS 
ARE HELD IN PRETTY LOW ESTEEM ALL 
POLITICIANS THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS 
TAKES THE BIGGEST HIT BECAUSE IT 
HAS THE MOST M. P.'S WHEN PEOPLE SEE 
HOW MUCH IS BEING CLAIMED FOR FOOD 
AND FOR UTILITY BILLS AND HOW A LOT 
OF M. P.'S SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PUSHING AS 
FAR AS THEY CAN AND CLAIMING 
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING GETTING THE 
BIGGEST POSSIBLE HOUSE TO GET THE 
FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND 
ALLOWANCE WHICH WOULD MUST GET YOU 
AN ENORMOUS MORTGAGE THERE WILL BE 
A LOT OF PUBLIC REVULSION TO THAT 
WE WON'T GET THE JOHN LEWIS LIST 
BIT 
NO WE DON'T KNOW WHICH BIT PARTY LEADER DEPENDING ON HIS 
DOMESTIC TASTES HAVE CHARGED TO 
THE TAXPAYERS MAYBE I. K. E. A. DOOR 
CHIMES 
DOES THE PUBLIC NEED TO CHIMES KNOW THAT 
I THINK PEOPLE DO KNOW 
WHETHER THEY'VE SPENT IT ON THEIR 
DOOR CHIMES 
WE MUST MOVE ON WE 
DON'T THINK IT WILL COME OUT WHILE 
WE ARE ON AIR I'M SURE WE WILL 
TALK ABOUT IT LATER 
I THINK 
THEY'RE DELAYING IT 
TO THE LAST 
POSSIBLE MOMENT 
UNTIL THIS 
PROGRAMME IS OFF AIR ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY EARLIER THIS WEEK A REPORT FROM 
THE HOUSE OF LORDS FOUND THAT 
RECORD LEVELS HAVE HAD LITTLE OR NO 
IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING 
OF BRITONS THE REPORT SUGGESTED 
THAT COMPETITION FROM IMMIGRANTS 
HAS HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE 
LOW PAID AND THAT IT'S ALSO 
CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER HOUSE PRICES 
IN A MOMENT I'LL BE TALKING TO ONE 
YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR WHO MOVED TO THE 
U. K. FROM POLAND FIVE YEARS AGO 
FIRST OF ALL HERE'S GILES WITH 
SOME OF THE BACKGROUND TO THIS 
STORY STORY YOU MENTIONED THAT REPORT FROM THE 
LORDS IT GARNERED A LOT OF 
HEADLINES THE GOVERNMENT WILL TELL 
YOU THAT IMMIGRATION HAS GIVEN SIX 
BILLION TO OUR ECONOMY GREAT STUFF 
A LOT OF MONEY BUT THE LORD'S 
REPORT SAYS THAT FIGURE IS 
MISLEADING AND IRRELEVANT WHY 
THEY WOULD LIKE US TO CONCENTRATE 
ON SOMETHING ELSE THE EFFECT OF 
IMMIGRATION ON G. D. P. PER CAPITA WHAT 
DOES THAT MEAN IN ENGLISH IT MEANS 
THE ANNUAL INCOME PER PERSON 
SPECIFICALLY THE ANNUAL INCOME PER 
PERSON RESIDENT IN THIS COUNTRY 
EXCLUDING IMMIGRANTS SYSTEM ON THAT 
BASIS THE REPORT SUGGESTS THAT 
IMMIGRATION HAS HAD VERY LITTLE 
IMPACT ON YOU OR MY ECONOMIC WELL 
BEING WE KNOW THE LATEST FIGURES 
FOR TWO THOUSAND SIX THAT FIVE HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND IMMIGRANTS 
CAME TO THE U. K. OVER THAT PERIOD 
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE LEFT IT GIVES US A 
NET IMMIGRATION FIGURE OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND 
IT'S THAT NET MIGRATION FIGURE THAT 
IS IMPORTANT FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND 
THE LORD'S REPORT THE LORD'S 
REPORT SUGGESTS THERE SHOULD BE A 
CAP ON THAT NUMBER NET MIGRATION 
SHOULD BE CAPPED THE GOVERNMENT 
SAYS NO WE HAVE A POINTS BASED 
SYSTEM THAT WILL CONTROL THOSE 
PEOPLE WHO COME IN BASED ON THE 
SKILLS THEY HAVE TO OFFER US 
THAT'S ALL THE NUMBERS AND 
STATISTICS WHAT ABOUT THE HUMAN 
FACES BEHIND THIS WHY DO PEOPLE 
WANT TO COME TO BRITAIN IN THE 
FIRST PLACE JENNY I BELIEVE YOU 
HAVE SOMEONE WITH YOU WHO MIGHT BE 
ABLE TO TELL US 
WE HAVE BEEN JOINED BY ANDRZEJ 
GARUS WHO MOVED TO THE U. K. FROM 
POLAND FIVE YEARS AGO HE OFFERS 
EMPLOYMENT SERVICES FOR MAINLY 
MIGRANT WORKERS WELCOME TO THE 
PROGRAMME 
GOOD AFTERNOON 
WHAT DID PROGRAMME BRING YOU TO THE U. K. FROM POLAND 
FIVE YEARS AGO 
FIRSTLY LIKE EVERY 
YOUNG PERSON IN EUROPE AND IN THE 
U. K. IT WAS A BIT OF AN ADVENTURE 
AS MUCH AS ECONOMIC REASONS L. ALSO 
HAD RELATIVES IN THE U. K. IT WAS 
QUITE EASY TO COME IN 
WHAT DID YOU 
DO WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HERE I I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE TO WORK THEN I 
DECIDED TOE EARN SOME MONEY FOR 
LIVING AND THEN SO I FOUND A JOB 
AS A PAINTER L. WAS WORKING OOS A 
PAINTER FOR SEVERAL YEARS FOR 
THREE YEARS ALMOST THREE AND A 
HALF YEARS 
YOU ARE MORE QUALIFIED 
THAN THAT 
YES YES L. FINISHED 
STUDIES AND I WAS STUDYING 
MARKETING AND ADVERTISING BEFORE 
THAT WAS THE EASIEST JOB TO FIND 
FOR ME SO I WAS OVER THOSE YEARS 
DOING WORK AND PAINTING BIG 
COMMERCIAL COMPANIES AS WELL AS 
FOR 
PRIVATE PEOPLE L. WAS PAINTING PRIVATE HOUSES 
WHAT KIND OF 
WELCOME DID YOU GET FROM PEOPLE 
HERE HAVE YOU BEEN MADE TO FEEL 
WELCOME 
YES FROM MY OWN WELCOME EXPERIENCE I HAD A VERY GOOD 
WELCOME PEOPLE I CAME ACROSS THEY 
WERE VERY VERY HAPPY ABOUT WHAT WE 
DO AND ALL OF THE CLIENTS I HAD AT 
THE TIME WERE HAPPY WITH THE WORK 
WE DID THEY WERE HAPPY ABOUT THE 
PRICE AS MUCH AS QUALITY I'M NOT 
SAYING THAT THE PRICE WAS MUCH 
LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE PRICE DO DO YOU THINK YOU WERE CONSCIOUSLY 
PRICING OTHER PEOPLE OUT OF WORK 
LIKE THE PAINTING JOBS 
NO L. DON'T 
THINK THAT MATTERS L. THINK THAT WE 
OFFERED THE QUALITY AS MUCH AS HIGH 
STANDARDS AND A GOOD PRICE THE 
PRICES WERE NOT MUCH LOWER THAN FOR 
ANY OTHER COMPANIES 
YOU SOON WENT 
ON AND LEFT THAT AND YOU HAVE NOW 
STARTED YOUR OWN BUSINESS YES YES LIKE RECRUITMENT AGENCY FOR 
MAINLY MIGRANT WORKERS 
YES A 
PERSONNEL BUSINESS WE PROVIDE 
TRAINING AND SUPPORT AND 
INFORMATION FOR MIGRANT WORKERS ON 
WAYS TO START LIVING IN THE U. K. AND 
HOW TO FIND JOBS WE HELP EMPLOYERS 
IN REACHING OUT TO NEW DIVERSE 
COMMUNITIES TO FIND CANDIDATES 
EMPLOYERS OFTEN COME TO US AND SAY 
THAT WITHOUT MIGRANT WORKERS THEY 
WOULD BE OUT OF BUSINESS 
WHAT SORT 
OF BUSINESSES DO COME TO YOU FOR 
MIGRANT WORKERS 
IT'S ACROSS THE 
SPECTRUM WE HAVE BEEN WORKING 
BEFORE FINDING PEOPLE FOR IT JOBS 
FINDING PEOPLE FOR CONSTRUCTION 
BUSINESS WE DID SOME WORK RECENTLY 
WITH A SOUTH WEST EMPLOYER IN 
SOCIAL CARE THEY WERE POSITIVE 
ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES EVERY TIME 
WE SPOKE TO THEM THEY WERE HAPPY 
ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ASHED THE 
FACT THEY HAVE MORE PEOPLE COMING 
IN AND FILLING IN THE GAPS IN THE 
COMPANIES THAT'S WHAT THEY 
APPRECIATE 
WHY ARE THEY COMING TO APPRECIATE YOU WHY DON'T THEY HIRE BRITISH 
WORKERS FOR THE JOBS THAT YOU ARE 
FILLING 
WELL IT'S DIFFICULT TO FILLING SAY THE MIGRANTS ARE COMING HERE 
WITH A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THEY 
ARE OFTEN MORE MOTIVATED AND HAPPY 
TO WORK HARD FOR WHAT THEY ARE 
GETTING I THINK EMPLOYERS ARE 
APPRECIATIVE OF THAT AGAIN THEY 
FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FILL THEIR 
VACANCIES WITH CANDIDATES THAT ARE 
ALREADY ON THE MARKET THEY ARE 
ALWAYS ACTIVELY SEEKING NEW 
CANDIDATES I CAN SAY FROM MY 
EXPERIENCE MANY EMPLOYERS ARE 
SEEKING ABROAD AND ORGANISING JOB 
FAIRS IN POLAND AND EASTERN EUROPE 
TO ATTRACT THOSE WORKERS TO THE U. K. 
WHY DO YOU THINK THIS HOUSE OF 
LORDS REPORT CONCLUDED THAT MIGRANT 
WORKERS DON'T BENEFIT THE ECONOMY 
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
I THINK THE 
CONTRIBUTION IS MUCH MUCH GREATER 
THAN JUST INCOME REALLY THE REPORT 
DIDN'T AGREE THAT MIGRANTS ARE 
BRINGING SIX BILLION A YEAR TO THE 
ECONOMY APART FROM THAT THE 
BENEFIT IS MUCH BIGGER THEY HELP 
GROW THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THEY 
HELP GROWING LOCAL SHOPS THEY ARE 
BUYING 
AND SPENDING IN 
LOCAL SHOPS THEY ARE DEVELOPING A 
CULTURAL ASPECT OF SOCIETY L. THINK 
THAT IS THE CONTRIBUTION KEVIN KEVIN WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ANDRZEJ'S 
COMMENTS 
THE ECONOMY HAS GROWN COMMENTS REPORT CONCLUDED THAT BUT THE 
EASTERN EUROPEANS CANNOT CREATE 
MORE WEALTH PER HEAD THE REPORT IN 
WAS 
ONE SIDED THE TRUTH IS 
THAT SOCIAL CARE WOULD COLLAPSE 
WITHOUT PEOPLE COMING IN FROM 
EASTERN EUROPE YOU WOULD FIND THE 
FRUIT AND VEG SHELVES IN THE 
SUPERMARKETS TOMORROW EMPTY IF IT 
WASN'T FOR MIGRANTS PICKING THEM 
THIS IS ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT 
SLAVE OWNERS MADE WHICH SAID THAT 
THE EXPENSE OF EVERYTHING WILL GO 
UP IF WE CAN'T HAVE SLAVES THIS 
IS RIDICULOUS HA HA 
IT'S THE SAME HA HA ARGUMENT MY GOD WE WOULD HAVE TO 
PAY MORE FOR OUR IMPORTED 
STRAWBERRIES IF WE GOT 
WHERE ARE 
THE MILLIONS OF BRITONS WAITING TO 
TAKE THESE JOBS WHERE ARE THEY 
THEY ARE LOUNGING ABOUT FRANKLY OFF 
THEIR FACES WITH CANNABIS AND BEER 
THAT'S THE TROUBLE IT WAS ALWAYS 
SAID THAT WE HAD A LOT OF VACANT 
JOBS SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND OR SOMETHING WHICH 
WOULD BE FILLED BY POLES INCIDENT 
ATHY YOU DIDN'T COME AND PAINT MY 
HOUSE AT ANY STAGE 
YOU USE THEM AS WELL 
THERE ARE STILL ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND 
JOBS OPEN PARTLY BECAUSE THE 
ECONOMY HAS GROWN BUT PARTLY 
BECAUSE THERE IS A HARD CORE OF 
BRITS WHO DO NOT WANT TO DO THESE 
JOBS THE WELFARE KEEPS THEM GOING 
ANDRZEJ DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT IF IF THERE ARE VAIKANIES AVAILABLE FOR 
EMPLOYERS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO 
WILL TAKE THE JOB IF THEY CAN'T 
FIND ANYONE THEY TRY TO FIND THE 
LABOUR ELSEWHERE 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
ARGUMENT THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE 
PUTTING A GREATER STRAIN ON SOCIAL 
SERVICES HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION 
THAT KIND OF THING YOU CAN 
UNDERSTAND THOSE CONCERNS IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY FROM MY 
PERSPECTIVE I'M SURE THE PEOPLE 
THAT ARE COMING IN THEY ALWAYS 
BRING THEIR FAMILIES IN THAT IS 
ALWAYS THE CASE IT'S DIFFICULT TO 
MEASURE I GUESS THE SOLUTION WOULD 
BE TO PUT THE MINIMUM WAGE UP AND 
THAT WAY THE CONTRIBUTION MIGHT BE 
GREATER TO THE ECONOMY 
DO YOU COME 
ACROSS RESENTMENT 
SOMETIMES YES 
BUT I THINK THE CASE ABOUT THE 
SOCIAL SUPPORT FOR WORKERS IS MUCH 
OVERRATED AND OFTEN EXAGGERATED IN 
THE MEDIA 
KEVIN DO YOU THINK IT'S 
OVEREXAGGERATED THE STRAIN ON THE 
SOCIAL SERVICES 
IN SOME AREAS NOT 
THERE ARE A LOT OF HOT SPOTS WITH 
PEOPLE COMING IN THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND 
VACANCIES YOU MENTIONED THAT'S 
BECAUSE THERE IS AN ECONOMY OF TWENTY EIGHT 
MILLION PEOPLE WHO WORK YOU ALWAYS 
HAVE FRUNKUATIONS 
THE PROBLEM IS 
THE REASON THAT BRITS ARE NOT 
FILLING THESE VACANCIES IS LOW 
SKILLS LOW ASPIRATIONS LOW 
EDUCATIONAL STANDARD THE THING 
ABOUT THE POLES AND EASTERN 
EUROPEANS WHO COME HERE IS THEY 
HAVE HIGH EDUCATION HIGH 
ASPIRATIONS HIGH ENERGY AND THE 
REASON THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE 
PARTICULARLY IN BUSINESS AND THE 
MIDDLE CLASSES JEREMY AND SAMANTHA 
WHO LOVE POLISH PLUMBERS THEY'RE 
IN FAVOUR OF ALL OF THIS BUT THE 
PROBLEM IS IF WE ARE GOING TO GET 
OUR SO CALLED UNDER CLASS TO 
ACTUALLY SUPPORT THEMSELVES RATHER 
THAN HAVE US AND TAXPAYERS LIKE YOU 
ANDRZEJ SUPPORTING THEM IS TO 
RAISE THEIR ASPIRATIONS AND RAISE 
THEIR EDUCATIONAL LEVEL AND STOP 
THEM LOUNGING AROUND 
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN THE THERE 
WAS A PILL YOU COULD TAKE TO MAKE 
YOU SMARTER WOULD YOU TAKE IT IF 
THEY COULD GIVE YOU THE EDGE AT 
SCHOOL OR UNIVERSITY WOULD IT BE 
FAIR AND ARE DRUGS CREATED TO MAKE 
ILL PEOPLE WELL OR SHOULD YOU TAKE 
ENHANCING DRUGS TO MAKE YOU FEEL 
BETTER IT SOUNDS LIKE SCIENCE 
FICTION WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT 
ABOUT TO RECEIVE A REPORT FROM THE 
ACADEMY OF MEDICAL SCIENCE ON JUST 
SUCH DRUGS BECAUSE THE FUTURE IS A 
LOT CLOSER THAN YOU MIGHT THINK 
IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE YOU COULD 
TAKE DRUG TO MAKE YOU SMARTER 
YOU COULD THINK QUICKER REMEMBER 
MORE AND DO THAT FOR LONGER YOU 
COULD TAKE A DRUG TO KILL OFF YOUR 
WORST NIGHTMARE IMAGINE WORLD 
WHERE YOUR WORST IMPULSES COULD BE 
CONTROLLED THROUGH DRUGS WOULD 
THAT BE GOOD OR A BAD WORLD THE 
ANSWER IS WHY THE GOVERNMENT HAVE 
COMMISSIONED REPORT INTO 
COGNITIVE ENHANCERS WILL BE 
HONEST THIS IS COMPLEX STUFF 
COGNITION IS THE BRAIN'S ABILITY TO 
THINK THE DRUGS COME IN DIFFERENT 
KINDS THAT DO DIFFERENT THINGS 
COGNITION IS NOT ONE THING IT IS 
MADE UP OF DIFFERENT THINGS SO YOU 
CAN GET TO ROME VIA MANY DIFFERENT 
ROUTES PEOPLE WILL FIND THE IDEA 
THAT DRUG CAN IMPROVE MEMORY IN 
NORMAL HEALTHY PEOPLE IS BIT STRANGE 
EVERYONE DRINKS COFFEE STRANGE BUT AS SOON AS SOMEONE MENTIONS 
TAKING A MEMORY BOOSTING DRUG TO 
HELP YOU EVERYONE SHUTS DOWN AND 
THINKS OF IT AS SOMETHING NEW AND 
TERRIFYING 
WE DON'T KNOW IN LONG TERRIFYING TERM WHAT THE POSSIBLY ADVERSE 
EFFECTS WOULD BE BE WE CAN SAY 
WITH SOME DRUGS THEY SEEM BENIGN ON 
THE WHOLE BUT AS WE 
ALL 
DRUGS HAVE SIDE EFFECTS SOMEWHERE 
ALONG THE LINE THERE IS ALWAYS A 
COST AND A BENEFIT 
MIND ENHANCING 
DRUGS WILL PUT MORE PRESSURE ON 
PEOPLE THERE WILL BE THE PRESSURE 
TO DEVELOP A BETTER DRUG TO MAKE 
THEM WORK HARDER WE ARE GOING TO 
BECOME ROBOTS 
COMING BACK TO THE 
POINT THAT COGNITION IS DIFFERENT 
THINGS YOU MAY BOOST SOME THINGS TO 
THE DETRIMENT OF OTHERS L. CAN 
IMAGINE THE MILITARY WANTING TO 
ENHANCE SUCH KINDS OF QUICK 
THINKING IN THE FIELD BUT THAT MAY 
BE AT THE COST OF POOR LONG TERM 
MEMORY 
WHAT I'M FRIGHTENED OFF MEMORY WILL THE DRUGS BE A PART OF 
CONTROL IT WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY 
FOR THE MENTAL PATIENT IT COULD BE 
FOR EVERYONE IN SOCIETY IF YOU 
DON'T BEHAVE YOURSELF YOU WILL BE 
CONTROLLED 
THAT IS A PROBLEM ISN'T CONTROLLED IT THEN YOU ARE BEING REQUIRED TO 
TAKE A DRUG TO IMPROVE YOUR 
PERFORMANCE UP TO THEIR CRITERIA 
WELL CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU CAN 
CHANGE CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN MAKE 
PEOPLE FORGET CERTAIN THINGSER YOU 
COULD MAKE SOMEONE VOTE A DIFFERENT 
WAY 
YES THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY NEGATIVE AND A POSITIVE SIDE THE 
SCIENCE IS FANTASTIC WHAT THE 
REPORTS WILL SHOW IS THAT WE ARE 
MAKING ADVANCES BUT AS WITH ALL 
ADVANCES WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL 
ABOUT THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS THAT 
IS WHY WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE 
PUBLIC AND POLITICIANS AND POLICY 
MAKERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THE 
BEST JOB OF USING DRUGS 
BENEFITS RATHER THAN HARMS A. N. N. A. N. N. AND KEVIN ARE STILL WITH ME ARE 
EITHER OF YOU TEMPTED BY THE DRUGS 
NO I'M NOW SO OLD IT IS WASTE OF 
TIME BUT I AM SO OLD I REMEMBER 
YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND 
SPRIEGTLY AND FOOLISH I TOOK A LOT 
OF THESE SO CALLED COGNITIVE DRUGS 
I DON'T THINK THEY CALLED THEM THAT 
DON'T GO THERE THE POLICE MIGHT BE 
WATCHING 
I'M NOT A POLITICIAN SO WATCHING I DON'T HAVE THE PROBLEM OF SAYING 
I THINK WHAT GEORGE BUSH SAID WHEN 
I WAS YOUNG AND FOOLISH I WAS YOUNG 
AND FOOLISH BUT ACTUALLY THESE 
DRUGS THEY GIVE YOU THE IMPRESSION 
THAT YOU ARE BRILLIANT AND YOU CAN 
KEEP GOING IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY 
DIFFERENCE TO YOUR BRILLIANCE IN 
THE END IT IS LIKE VALIUM IF YOU 
REMEMBER WELL YOU WON'T YOU ARE 
TOO YOUNG ITSELF WAS GOING TO BE 
HOUSE WIFE'S LITTLE HELPER AND THEY 
ENDED UP HOOKED ON IT NO I THINK 
WE ALL WANT TO HAVE SOME SHORT CUT 
TO BRILLIANCE L. DON'T IT EXISTS 
THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO SET UP 
A FRAMEWORK TO DEAL WITH THE DRUGS 
A LOT OF PARENTS GIVE THEIR KIDS 
VITAMINS WE GIVE KIDS FRUIT FOR 
VITAMIN C. SO WHY NOT TO IMPROVE 
YOUR MEMORY THERE WILL BE AN 
OUTCRY AND SOME PEOPLE WILL BE 
AGAINST IT AND GIVEN THE WEEK 
GORDON BROWN HAS HAD HE DOES NOT 
WANT MEM PEOPLE'S MEMORIES IMPROVED 
I COULD DO WITH A BOOST BUT NOT 
THAT KIND OF DRUG NOW THIS WEEK'S 
TOP POLITICAL STORIES WITH GILES I I HAVE NOT HAD MY SMART PILL THER DO 
YOU THINK THAT DOMESTIC POLITICS IS 
DULL OR DO THE BRITS LIKE FOREIGN 
NEWS FOR THE SECOND WEEK RUNNING A 
FOREIGN STORY HAS NOT JUST TAKEN 
THE NO ONE SLOT IT HAS WIPED THE 
FLOOR WITH EVERYTHING ELSE THIS 
WEEK IT IS ZIMBABWE LAST WEEK IT 
WAS NICOLAS SARKOZY THIS IS THIS 
WEEK'S TOP OF THE POLITICAL POPS 
ANOTHER DATE WITH TOP OF THE POPS 
AT FIVE CANNABIS SHOULD STAY A CLASS 
C. DRUG ACCORDING TO THE DRUGS 
ADVISORY COMMITTEE DESPITE THE 
PRIME MINISTER'S DESIRE TO HAVE IT 
RECLASSIFIED IT IS NOT BAD ENOUGH 
FOR THAT BUT THEY THEN DEPIGLED 
GIG LDZ UNCONTROLLIBLY 
NOW HIGHEST 
MOVER 
AT FOUR T. GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES MOVER NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS CALLED 
ECO TOWNS THERE WERE FIFTY SEVEN NOW THERE 
IS FIFTEEN NO NAMES BUT LOOK OUT FOR ON 
THE BRIDGE WELL BEING AT THREE 
HARRIET HARMAN TURNED PMQS INTO A 
STYLE SPAT 
IF I'M LOOKING FOR 
ADVICE ON WHAT TO WEAR OR WHAT NOT 
TO WEAR THE LAST PERSON I WOULD 
LOOK TO ADVICE IS THE MAN IN THE 
BASEBALL CAP 
THIS AFTER HE DARED 
DISRESPECT HER TAKE ON HIGH STREET 
FASHION GAGS ASIDE THE JOMKOUT 
SEEMED TO BE HAZZA ONE WILLIAM ONE 
SENSIBLE POLITICAL DEBATE NIL AT 
TWO A REPORT ATTACKED THE FINANCIAL 
ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF RECORD 
IMMIGRATION IT SAID PER PERSON IT 
HAS HAD LITTLE OR NO IMPACT ON 
ECONOMIC WELL BEING SOME M. P.'S 
REJECTED THE POLL SAYING THE POLES 
DECORATING THEIR SECOND HOME HAD A 
HUGE IMPACTS AND FOUR MILLION 
CLICKS ON TO THE STORY OF THE 
ZIMBABWEAN ELECTION THE SAME 
NUMBER OF ZIM DOLLARS IT TAKES TO 
BUY A LOAF OF BREAD THERE STILL NO 
RESULT AND THE 
M. D. C. CLAIM 
THAT IS 
BECAUSE UNBOB LOST AND CAN'T 
TAKE IT UNCLE BOB THE TOP 
FIVE STORIES OF THE WEEK TO TALK 
ABOUT THE NO ONE STORY WE HAVE BEEN 
JOINED BY KATE HOEY TO BRING US 
UP TO DATE THIS STORY IS MOVING 
TALL TIME THE LEADERSHIP OF THE 
ZANU P. F. PARTY HAS BRIN MEETING 
BEEN MEETING TODAY AND THE 
OPPOSITION HAS ASKED THE HIGH COURT 
TO ORDER THE RELEASE OF THE 
ELECTION RESULTS THE GOVERNMENT 
HERE IS BEING CAREFUL NOT TO CALL 
FOR ROBERT MUGABE TO STEP DOWN 
WHAT IS GOING ON 
I THINK GOING ON 
BELIENDS THE SCENES GORDON BROWN 
HAS BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF BEING 
ON THE PHONE A LOT TODAY IT IS 
VERY USEFUL BECAUSE THE SOTH 
AFRICAN PRESIDENT COMES IN AS TO 
THE PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND 
WHO HAS BEEN STRONG ON ZIMBABWE 
I'M HOPING THAT TONIGHT WHEN THEY 
MEET THAT A LOT MORE PRESSURE WILL 
BE PUT ON MBEKI HE HAS SAID 
SOMETHING BUT HE SAID ACTUALLY 
THE SOUTH AFRICAN SOURCES THAT 
THESE WERE FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS 
THAT IS NONSENSE L. HOPE THAT THERE 
WILL BE SOME MOVEMENT WHAT I WOULD 
LIKE MBEKI TO DO IS ACTUALLY GO 
STRAIGHTS TO ZIMBABWE AND HE IS 
THE ONE PERSON WHO COULD BRING 
TOGETHER IN A ROOM MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI AND ROBERT MUGABE IT IS 
PROBLG AT THIS STAGE IT IS MORE 
LIKELY TO BE SOME PEOPLE AROUND 
ROBERT MUGABE WHO ARE TERRIFIED OF 
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM IT IT SHOULD COME FROM MBEKI NOT FROM 
BRITAIN 
I HAVE TO SAY I LIKED WHAT BRITAIN ARCHBISHOP TUE TUE SAID IT IS NOT 
THE TIME TO WORRY BUT THE TIME TO 
BE THE SOLIDLY SAYING YOUR TIME IS 
UP THIS TIME PEOPLE VOTED WITH SO 
MUCH HOPE AND SO MUCH FEELING THAT 
IT COULD CHANGE WE CANNOT A AN 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ALLOW IT TO 
DRIFT 
YOU THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DRIFT GROUP ON ZIMBABWE 
AN ACTSIVE GROUP 
YOU HAVE BEEN THERE 
I HAVE BEEN 
UNDERCOVER AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING 
TO PEOPLE L. HEARD ABOUT THE LEGAL 
THINGS THIS MORNING PEOPLE ARE 
STILL DESPERATE TO GET A PEACEFUL 
CHANGE THAT IS WHAT IS FANTASTIC 
ABOUT THE OPPOSITION DESPITE 
EVERYTHING ALL THE HARASSMENT AND 
THEY COULD NOT GO AROUND NORMALLY 
CAMPAIGNING MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAD 
HIS HELICOPTER TAKEN FROM HIM ON 
THE FIRST DAY HE GOT A HELICOPTER 
AND IT WAS TAKEN OFF HIM ALL THESE 
THINGS BEHIND THE SCENES WHERE 
THERE IS NO MEDIA THERE ARE PEOPLE 
BEING BEATEN UP YET THEY CAME OUT 
AND VOTED YET THEY HAVE KEPT 
PEACEFUL IT WILL SEND A BAD SIGNAL 
TO THE WORLD IF THE ONLY WAY YOU 
GET THE INTERNATIONAL WORLD TO COME 
IN IS ENYOU IS WHEN YOU KILL 
PEOPLE 
YOU HAVE STRONG LINKS WITH PEOPLE ZIMBABWE A. N. N. 
WORKED THERE WHEN IT 
WAS RHODESIA AND ONE OF HUGE 
MISCALCULATIONS IN MY LIFE WAS WHEN 
ROBERT MUGABE CAME IN AND I 
DESCRIBED HIM AS A MAN OF IMMENSE 
MORAL STATURE KATE BROUGHT UP 
MBEKI THE AWFUL THING IS YOU KNOW 
SOUTH AFRICA BEING THE SUPERPOWER 
OF AFRICA COULD HAVE DONE 
SOMETHING BEFORE BUT THERE IS THIS 
TERRIBLE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM 
THAT THEY REGARD ROBERT MUGABE AS 
ONE OF THE BIG MEN MBEKI WAS NOT 
HE WAS AN EXILE HE ALWAYS FEELS I 
CAN'T REALLY MOVE AGAINST HIM 
SORRY WE HAVE RUN OUT OF TIME 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US 
THAT IS ALL FOR THIS WEEK THANK 
YOU TO MY GUESTS WE ARE OFF AIR 
FOR TWO WEEKS AND WE WILL RETURN 
WHEN THE M. P.'S FINISH THEIR EASTER 
HOLIDAYS ON MONDAY TWENTY FIRST APRIL BUT
