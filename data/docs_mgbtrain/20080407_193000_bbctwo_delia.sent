THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN HAS INVOLVED FINDING REALLY GOOD READY PREPARED INGREDIENTS 
SOMEBODY HAS DONE ALL THE PREPARATION AND YOU DO THE FINISHING TOUCHES 
WHAT IT'S DOING IT'S JUST SHORT CIRCUITING 
YOUR TIME IN THE KITCHEN WHEN YOU'RE BUSY OR WHEN YOU'RE SCARED 
WELL SOMETIMES IF YOU'VE BEEN CHEATING ALL WEEK YOU LIKE TO GET 
DOWN TO THE REAL THING AT WEEKENDS AND HAVE SOME REAL COOKING TIME 
THERE ARE OTHER TIMES WHEN YOU'RE FEELING A BIT LAZY BUT YOU WANT 
TO HAVE SOME FRIENDS ROUND AND YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK TOO HARD THAT'S WHAT I'VE GOT TO SHOW YOU NOW 
I HOPE THE FIRST ONE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IS ACTUALLY GOING TO KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF 
BECAUSE IT'S A CHEESE ONION AND SAGE TART 
AND ME TELL YOU THAT USED TO BE AN AWFUL LOT OF BOTHER 
BUT IT'S NOT A LOT OF BOTHER NOW BECAUSE WHAT I'VE GOT IN MY FREEZER 
IS A READY MADE READY TO GO TART CASE 
ALTHOUGH THIS COMES FROM THE SUPERMARKET FRESH I ALWAYS LIKE TO KEEP THEM IN THE FREEZER 
I THINK THEY COOK BETTER ACTUALLY FROM FROZEN 
SO I KEEP MINE IN THE FREEZER 
IN THE JUG HERE I'VE GOT ONE FIFTY M. L. OF DOUBLE CREAM 
YOU CAN USE SINGLE CREAM IF YOU WANT TO BUT DOUBLE CREAM IS NICE 
THEN I'VE GOT A DESSERTSPOON OF SAGE 
THAT'S GOING TO GO IN WITH THE CREAM 
TWO EGGS IN 
AND IF YOU CAN REMEMBER THE EARLY DAYS OF MAKING TARTS OR QUICHES 
WHEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PASTRY 
LET IT REST THEN ROLL IT OUT THEN BAKE IT BLIND 
ALL THOSE SORT OF PROCEDURES HAVE ALL GONE NOW BECAUSE THE FILLING 
IS GOING TO GO STRAIGHT IN AND IT'S GOING TO BE COOKED FROM FROZEN 
AND WHAT I NEED NOW IS TWO DESSERTSPOONS OF PARMESAN CHEESE 
IN WITH MY FILLING 
AND THEN I'M GOING TO USE A TABLESPOON OF STRONG 
EXTRA STRONG GRATED CHEDDAR 
GIVE THAT ALL A LITTLE WHISK TOGETHER 
EGGS CHEESE AND EVERYTHING 
AND IT'S GOING TO NEED A BIT OF SEASONING 
SO JUST PUT A BIT OF SEASONING IN THERE AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE THE ONIONS ARE COMING FROM 
THEY'RE ACTUALLY COMING FROM THE TIN 
BUT WHAT SOMEBODY'S DONE HERE IS PEELED THEM FOR YOU 
CHOPPED THEM FOR YOU AND SAUTEED THEM IN OLIVE OIL FOR YOU 
SO WE JUST WANT TO DRAIN IT A LITTLE BIT 
TO DO THAT I AM JUST GOING TO USE A SPOON 
AND IF YOU'VE GOT THIS SITTING IN YOUR LARDER AND THE PASTRY TART CASE IN YOUR FREEZER 
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE THIS AVAILABLE TO SERVE 
TO FRIENDS IN NO TIME AT ALL 
SO ONCE YOU'VE SQUEEZED ALL THE JUICE OUT 
THEY CAN GO STRAIGHT INTO THE PASTRY TART CASE 
SPREAD THEM OUT A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT 
THE FILLING GOES IN NEXT 
THAT'S NOW GOING TO HAVE SOME SAGE LEAVES 
I USUALLY PUT ABOUT EIGHT ON THE TOP 
THEN WHAT I'M GOING TO USE NOW A NICE ROUNDED DESSERTSPOON 
OF PARMESAN CHEESE 
JUST ON THE TOP THERE 
TO GIVE A NICE SURFACE 
AND THE OVEN IS PREHEATED TO TWO HUNDRED C. BUT I'M NOW GOING TO TURN IT DOWN 
IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN TO ONE EIGHTY C. 
BUT WHY I PREHEATED IT TO TWO HUNDRED C. 
IS BECAUSE I'VE GOT A BAKING SHEET IN THERE AND THE BAKING SHEET IS 
AN IMPORTANT INGREDIENT IN GETTING THIS RIGHT 
THEN WE'RE JUST GOING TO LIFT THE TART CAREFULLY ONTO THE HOT BAKING SHEET 
IT'S GOING TO GO INTO THE OVEN WHICH IS NOW TURNED DOWN 
AND THAT HOT BAKING SHEET AND THE HEAT IN THE OVEN FIRST 
IS WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE UNDERNEATH CRUST REALLY CRISP 
AND THAT IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE MAKING SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
AND CAREFULLY PLACE IT IN THE OVEN 
AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY MINUTES TO COOK THROUGH 
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF WRITING RECIPES IS THE TESTING 
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SPENDING TIME AND MONEY IT HAS TO WORK 
ARE YOU THERE 
HELLO I'VE BROUGHT SOME FRIENDS WITH ME OH HELLO 
PAULINE IS A FRIEND OF MINE WHO FOR MANY MANY YEARS NOW HAS TESTED 
ALL MY RECIPES WHERE ARE WE UP TO 
WELL WE'RE GETTING TO THE THICK CHEESE TART AND THE CURRIES 
WE HAVE A TEST SHEET AND THE TEST SHEET HAS LIKE TWENTY QUESTIONS ON IT 
MOMENT OF TRUTH 
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH 
THAT'S THE RECIPE AND THAT'S MY TEST SHEET THERE 
WHEN THE RECIPE'S READY I LIKE IT TO GO TO SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT NOTHING 
TO DO WITH IT AT ALL OTHER THAN JUST COOK IT AT HOME AND SHOP FOR IT 
TWO PER PACKET ONE SIXTY G. PER PACKET THAT'S GOOD INFORMATION 
SEASONING AND CAYENNE PEPPER MISSING FROM THE RECIPE 
I THOUGHT THE CHICKEN WAS OVERCOOKED AT THE END YOU SEE 
BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY COOKED AND THEN IT'S COOKED FOR ANOTHER TWENTY MINUTES 
O. K. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ONE 
SO SHE WILL SHOP SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO GET THE INGREDIENTS 
IT'S GOT TO BE WHAT PEOPLE CAN GET ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
BECAUSE IF PAULINE SAYS TO ME I CAN'T GET THAT INGREDIENT ANYWHERE HERE 
THEN YOU KNOW THAT'S IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE DOING RECIPES JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR THE FULHAM ROAD 
LOVELY BUT WHAT I DID DELIA WAS I PUT IT ON A PRE HEATED BAKING TRAY 
THAT'S THE SECRET 
SO THAT IT'S PRE HEATED THE BAKING SHEET 
I PUT IT IN THE OVEN WHEN I SWITCHED THE OVEN ON 
THAT IS A STEP FOR MANKIND WE'LL REMEMBER TO SAY THAT IN THE RECIPE 
YOU'LL PUT THAT ON THE TEST SHEET WILL YOU I WILL 
PAULINE WOULD YOU HAVE CONSIDERED BUYING PASTRY CASES BEFORE DELIA SORT OF INTRODUCED THEM NO NEVER 
NEVER NEVER WOULD I HAVE DONE THAT 
BUT I'M LEARNING A LOT FROM DELIA 
IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR EVERYBODY 
RIGHT TIME'S UP 
WHAT WE HAVE IS A LOVELY GOLDEN SURFACE AND A LOVELY PUFFY TART 
AND THE PASTRY IS NICE AND CRISP ALL THE WAY ROUND 
A GOOD TIP IS BEFORE YOU SERVE IT YOU NEED TO LET IT SETTLE FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES 
OTHERWISE IT'S DIFFICULT TO SERVE 
SO JUST LEAVE IT IT'LL KEEP ITS HEAT PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT FOR TEN MINUTES 
THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER FILLINGS YOU COULD PUT IN THERE 
I'VE DONE ONE WITH ROQUEFORT CHEESE AND LEEKS WHICH IS LOVELY 
OR CLASSIC QUICHE LORRAINE OR EVEN SMOKED SALMON IS VERY NICE 
AND IF YOU WANT TO SERVE IT AS A FIRST COURSE WITH SOME FRIENDS 
THESE YOU WILL FIND IN THE FREEZER SECTION 
AND THESE ARE LITTLE INDIVIDUAL TART CASES 
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE FILLINGS I'VE DONE FROM THE LARGER ONE FIT PERFECTLY 
INTO SIX SMALL ONES AND COOK IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY 
WELL THE REALLY GOOD NEWS I HAVE FOR YOU IS THAT NOT ONLY CAN YOU BUY 
A FLAN CASE LINED WITH PASTRY READY TO USE YOU CAN ALSO BUY A LID 
AND YOU GET A PACKET OF TWO LIDS 
THEY COME LIKE THIS AND THEY'RE FROZEN 
YOU MUST MAKE SURE THEY'RE DEFROSTED I MADE THE MISTAKE 
OF TRYING TO UNROLL IT WHEN IT WASN'T QUITE DEFROSTED AND WHAT HAPPENS IS IT CRACKS 
ONCE IT IS DEFROSTED YOU JUST UNROLL IT LIKE THIS 
IT UNROLLS WITH THE PAPER 
NOW THAT'S READY TO BE A LID ON A PIE 
WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS A PIE 
WHICH IS THE SAME CASE THAT YOU SAW WITH THE ONIONS IN IT 
THIS TIME IT'S GOT ONE L. B. OR SEVEN HUNDRED G. OF MIXED APPLES 
NOW I'VE GOT BRAMLEY APPLES AND I'VE GOT COX'S APPLES 
THEY'VE BEEN SLICED AND I HAVE SOME CLOVES AND SOME SUGAR 
WHAT I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THIS IS ONCE YOU GET INTO THE HABIT OF DOING THIS YOU CAN MAKE THIS PIE 
ANY TIME OF THE YEAR WITH ANY FRUIT THAT'S IN SEASON 
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE ONE L. B. OR SEVEN HUNDRED G. OF FRUIT IT FITS THE CASE 
AND IT FITS THE LID 
SO THAT'S READY TO HAVE THE LID ON FIRST OF ALL I'M GOING TO PUT 
I'VE GOT HERE A BEATEN EGG WHITE 
GO ROUND THE EDGE OF THE PIE WITH SOME OF THAT EGG WHITE SO IT WILL STICK WHEN I PUT THE LID ON 
NOW LIFT IT UP WITH THE PAPER 
PUT IT ON TOP OF THE APPLES 
PEEL THE PAPER OFF AND GET RID OF IT 
AND THEN JUST EASE IT ROUND THE EDGES HERE 
AND I'M GOING TO MAKE A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FIFTY P. PIECE 
SO THAT'LL ALLOW THE STEAM TO ESCAPE 
NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH THE REST OF THE EGG WHITE IS PAINT IT ALL OVER 
BECAUSE THE PIE IS GOING TO HAVE A NICE GLAZE 
WHICH GIVES IT THAT HOME MADE LOOK THERE WE GO 
NOW SOME DEMERARA SUGAR 
JUST VERY EVENLY ALL THE WAY ROUND 
THERE WE GO JUST LET ME SHOW YOU THIS NOW 
WHEN YOU LIFT IT YOU NEED TO GRAB IT BETWEEN YOUR 
YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL CASE ITSELF 
IT'S QUITE HARD IF YOU TRY TO LIFT IT LIKE THAT JUST GRAB THE EDGES 
PUT IT ON TO A BAKING SHEET 
AND THAT'S GOING TO GO THIS TIME INTO A HOT OVEN TWO HUNDRED C. 
AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
AND THAT'S AS EASY AS PIE 
I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED BEING INVOLVED WITH NORWICH CITY 
AT THE MOMENT THERE'S A LOT TO DO 
AS WE'RE GOING TO OPEN A NEW RESTAURANT FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC 
FOOTBALL IS VERY VERY VERY EXPENSIVE 
AND TO PAY FOR IT ALL YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME INCOME STREAM 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DESPERATELY TRYING TO DO 
I LIKE TO MAKE SURE I'M INVOLVED IN EVERY PROCESS WITH MY TEAM 
FROM THE CHOICE OF FOOD 
THIS IS ONE OF MICHAEL'S FAVOURITE RECIPES THIS ONE 
HE LIKES TO COOK THIS ALL THE TIME 
TO HOW THE RESTAURANT IS DESIGNED 
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO MAKE IT INTO A BIG FOOTBALL THEMED PLACE NO 
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A RELAXED PLACE WHERE FAMILIES CAN COME 
IS THAT THE FLOOR YES 
IS THAT GOOD STUFF DO STILETTOES GO ON IT ALL RIGHT 
YEAH SHOULD BE O. K. ON THE PINE YEAH 
IS THIS COMING UP TO YOUR VISION 
WELL I CAN'T QUITE SEE IT YET 
IT'S SORT OF NEW YORK WAREHOUSE 
THAT'S WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE OH WELL 
VERY EXCITING IS IT ON SCHEDULE 
YEAH AT THE MOMENT I'LL KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED 
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO ENTERTAIN BUT STILL BE FAIRLY LAZY 
RIGHT I'VE GOT A REAL WINNER OF A RECIPE TO SHOW YOU NOW 
IT'S CALLED SPANISH PORK STEW WITH POTATOES AND CHORIZO 
AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU CAN PUT INTO A POT SHORT CIRCUIT ALL THE RULES 
OF COOKING AND JUST GO OUT 
MAYBE ON A SUNDAY MORNING AND DO SOMETHING ELSE 
AND THEN THE OVEN DOES THE WORK 
IN MY COOKING POT I'M GOING TO PUT SOME PORK 
WE'VE GOT FOUR FIFTY G. OF CUBED SHOULDER OF PORK 
YOU'LL NOTICE THAT NORMALLY IN COOKING 
YOU'D BE BROWNING THE MEAT STANDING THERE DOING A FEW PIECES AT A TIME 
BUT WITH THIS ONE IT JUST ALL GOES IN THE POT AND IT'S NO WORK AT ALL 
THERE WE ARE A TABLESPOON OF OLIVE OIL 
THEN I'M GOING TO ADD THE CHORIZO WHICH IS ONE TEN G. 
CUT INTO LITTLE CHUNKS 
HERE I'VE GOT A SLICED REALLY FAT CLOVE OF GARLIC 
I'VE GOT SOME SPRIGS OF THYME 
ABOUT SIX SPRIGS OF THYME 
THIS IS A LARGE RED ONION THAT HAS BEEN SLICED QUITE THINLY INTO RINGS 
THIS WAS DEVELOPED OUT OF TRYING TO FIND A RECIPE THAT COULD ALL BE JUST 
PUT IN A POT WITH NO SKILL AND NO TIME SPENT 
IF I'M HONEST WITH YOU IT'S PROBABLY TAKEN ME ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES 
TO PREPARE ALL THESE INGREDIENTS 
NOW I'VE GOT SOME WHOLE ROASTED PEPPERS THAT YOU GET IN A JAR LIKE THIS ONE HERE 
AND I AM USING ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE JAR 
I'VE HALVED THEM AND WE'RE JUST BEGINNING TO GET SOME FANTASTIC COLOUR IN HERE 
AND ALSO THE AROMA OF THE PEPPERS IS LOVELY 
I'VE GOT ABOUT A TABLESPOON OF GREEN AND A TABLESPOON OF BLACK OLIVES 
WE'VE GOT FOUR FIFTY G. OF POTATOES HERE 
THESE ARE LITTLE SALAD POTATOES 
THEY TAKE TO CASSEROLING QUITE WELL THEY DON'T MIND LONG COOKING 
THEY'RE CALLED ANYA A BIT KNOBBLY BUT THEY HAVE A LOVELY FLAVOUR 
THE SAUCE I HAVE GOT IS A JAR OF THICK CONCENTRATED TOMATO SAUCE 
THE REASON I'M USING A THICK CONCENTRATED ONE IS BECAUSE I'M GOING TO USE SOME WINE AS WELL 
HERE I'VE GOT SOME DRY WHITE WINE I'VE GOT ONE FIFTY M. L. 
I JUST GOING TO PUT THAT INTO THE JAR AND GIVE IT A GOOD SHAKE TO GET THE LAST OF THE TOMATO OUT 
THAT'S GOING TO COOK DOWN TO A BEAUTIFUL SAUCE 
THEN I'M GOING TO ADD ANOTHER VERY SPANISH INGREDIENT 
SAFFRON I'VE GOT ABOUT A QUARTER OF A TEASPOON HERE 
THAT'S GOING TO BE SLACKENED WITH TWO TABLESPOONS OF WINE VINEGAR 
THEN I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE IT A LITTLE WHISK 
NOW THE COLOUR IS GOING TO BE EVEN MORE FANTASTIC WHEN THAT GOES IN 
QUITE A BIT OF FRESHLY MILLED PEPPER 
AND THEN SOME SALT 
AND THEN WE'RE JUST GOING TO BRING THEM UP TO THE BOIL 
AND AS SOON AS IT REACHES SIMMERING POINT IT'S GOING TO GO INTO THE OVEN ONE HUNDRED FORTY DEGREES 
AND COOK FOR ABOUT ONE TWO HOURS WHILE YOU ENJOY YOUR SUNDAY MORNING AND DO OTHER THINGS 
VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING I TRY TO KEEP FIT WITH THE HELP OF A PERSONAL TRAINER 
YOU'RE DOING WELL THAT'S IT 
HENRY WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY A PHYSIO 
HE COMES THREE TIMES A WEEK AND WE DO ABOUT FORTY MINUTES THREE TIMES A WEEK 
WE FOLLOW A PROGRAMME MIXING CARDIOVASCULAR EXERCISE 
WITH SOME RESISTANCE EXERCISE MAINLY FREE WEIGHTS 
DUMBBELLS TO THE FRONT SHOULDERS BACK 
LIFT YOUR ELBOWS TO SHOULDER HEIGHT AND DOWN 
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE PINCHING YOUR SHOULDER BLADES TOGETHER THERE 
THAT'S IT 
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR MY UPPER MIDDLE AGED SPREAD I'M AFRAID 
BUT IT DOES KEEP ME VERY SUPPLE 
I CAN DEFINITELY SEE THAT YOU'RE TIRED BUT I STILL THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP GOING WITH IT 
SOMETIMES I WISH IT TO KINGDOM COME 
I GET UP IN THE MORNING AND THINK OH MY GOD HENRY'S COMING UGH 
WHAT AM I GONNA DO BUT AS SOON AS YOU GET OUT THERE AND GET THE FRESH AIR I DO LOVE HAVING 
BREATHING DEEPLY FRESH AIR IN THE COUNTRY I THINK THAT'S REALLY NICE 
YOU'VE DONE WELL THIS MORNING 
IT'S GOOD WORK 
RIGHT THERE WE HAVE IT 
AND I CAN'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING SO SIMPLE 
CAN TASTE SO GOOD 
IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING YOU WANT 
JUST SERVE WITH FRIENDS NO HASSLE NO LAST MINUTE PREPARATION 
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO DO ANY POTATOES THEY'RE ALL IN THERE 
WE SERVE THIS SOMETIMES WITH LITTLE GREEN BEANS 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO BRING THEM UP TO THE BOIL COOK FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND OFF YOU GO 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED HERE DELIA 
ABOUT THIRTY SIX YEARS NOW A LONG TIME 
WHAT MADE YOU COME HERE 
WELL WHEN I WAS A CHILD 
I LIVED VERY MUCH IN THE SUBURBS 
AND I ALWAYS HAD THIS LONGING TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY 
THAT WAS THE ONLY AMBITION I HAD TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY 
I WANTED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY I USED TO START LOOKING 
I WENT TO SOME ESTATE AGENT AND THIS WAS IN IT 
AND IT'S IN SUCH A NICE POSITION 
I NEVER GET UP IN THE MORNING WITHOUT GOING WOW 
SO THAT IS ACTUALLY THIS KITCHEN HERE THAT'S THIS KITCHEN HERE 
THIS WAS CALLED FAMILY FARE AND IT WAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE FOR B. B. C. 
THIS IS ME DOING A SUMMER VERSION AND THIS ONE WAS ME IN THIS KITCHEN AGAIN THAT WAS A SUMMER ONE 
MY HAIR WAS THICK AND MY WAIST WAS SLIM IT WAS LOVELY 
WHEN I STARTED WRITING RECIPES 
YOU HAD VERY SMART COLOUR SUPPLEMENT COOKING 
THAT WAS BEYOND MOST PEOPLE AND THEN YOU HAD 
THERE WASN'T REALLY ANYTHING IN BETWEEN 
AND I FELT MY VOCATION WAS TO PROVIDE THE IN BETWEEN 
TO FILL THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO 
DO YOU GUYS WANT A COFFEE 
I'D LOVE ONE THANKS BLACK EVERYBODY 
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A RECIPE THAT I THINK'S QUITE A LOT OF FUN 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE GOT FRIENDS COMING OVER 
IT'S A VERY SLOW COOKED CHILLI 
IT'S CALLED CINCINNATI FIVE WAYS CHILLI AND IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT 
FROM THE KIND OF CHILLI WE'RE USED TO SERVING OVER HERE 
WE'LL START OFF WITH THE NORMAL CHILLI INGREDIENT WHICH IS BEEF 
THIS IS BRAISING STEAK 
THE BRAISING STEAK HAS BEEN CHOPPED SO WE'VE GOT FIVE HUNDRED G. THERE 
WHICH ARE GOING INTO THE CASSEROLE 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BROWN IT 
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY EASY 
HERE I'VE GOT A LARGE ONION AND THE ONION HAS BEEN CHOPPED 
REALLY FINELY AS YOU CAN SEE HERE 
WITH TWO FAT CLOVES OF GARLIC 
AND I'VE GOT HERE A HEAPED TEASPOON OF WHOLE CORIANDER SEEDS 
AND A HEAPED TEASPOON OF CUMIN SEEDS 
I'M GOING TO CRUSH THEM BUT NOT VERY FINELY JUST 
THEY REALLY DO GIVE 
A LOVELY FRAGRANCE AND AROMA 
SO IN THEY GO NEXT ALL OVER THE MEAT 
A HEAPED TEASPOONFUL OF GROUND CINNAMON 
AND THEN THIS ONE HERE WHICH IS PIMENTON PICANTE HOT PAPRIKA 
THIS HAS GOT THE LOVELY SMOKED FLAVOUR 
I'M GOING TO USE A HEAPED TEASPOON OF THAT 
I ALWAYS LOVE THE COLOUR 
AND THE SAUCE WE'RE GOING TO COOK THE CHILLI IN 
IS THIS WHICH IS A REDUCED TOMATO PEPPER AND CHILLI SAUCE 
THIS IS THE CHEAT ELEMENT BECAUSE IT SAVES US CRUSHING CHILLIES 
AND SAUTEING PEPPERS AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO 
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME LEFT I'M GOING TO RINSE IT OUT WITH A QUARTER OF A JAR OF WARM WATER 
THAT'S GOING TO JUST HELP 
TO KEEP IT MOIST THEN WE'LL HAVE SOME SALT 
I'LL JUST GIVE IT A STIR FIRST 
WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY COOK IT FOR FOUR HOURS 
LET'S JUST TAKE IT OVER 
I'M GOING TO TURN THE HEAT ON HIGH 
JUST GET IT UP TO SIMMERING POINT LET IT SIMMER REALLY GENTLY 
JUST ONE OR TWO BUBBLES COMING UP TO THE SURFACE 
THIS LONG SLOW COOKING JUST BRINGS OUT SUCH A WONDERFUL FLAVOUR 
SO WHEN IT COMES UP TO SIMMERING POINT I'M GOING TO TURN IT DOWN 
TO ITS VERY LOWEST AND JUST PUT THE LID ON 
AND LET IT SIMMER GENTLY FOR FOUR HOURS 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A REALLY GOOD SUPPER OR LUNCH WAITING FOR YOU 
THE REASON THIS IS CALLED CINCINNATI FIVE WAYS CHILLI IS BECAUSE 
IT HAS FIVE ACCOMPANIMENTS WHEN YOU SERVE THE CHILLI 
YOU GIVE EVERYBODY A BOWL OF CHILLI 
AND THEN THEY JUST DIP IN AND HELP THEMSELVES TO VARIOUS COMPONENTS 
SO WE JUST GET A LADLEFUL OF CHILLI IN THERE 
LIKE THAT 
THERE WE GO 
YOU CAN HAVE A BIT OF EACH OR CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT 
LITTLE BIT OF CHEESE WHICH WILL MELT DOWN INTO THE HOT CHILLI 
THEN WE'LL HAVE A FEW PINTO BEANS 
MY FRIEND MATT WHO GAVE ME THIS RECIPE SAYS NEVER KIDNEY BEANS 
ALWAYS PINTO BEANS 
A NICE DOLLOP OF SOUR CREAM ON TOP 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS THE BISCUITS ARE JUST BROKEN UP LIKE THIS 
YOU CAN USE ANY KIND OF CRACKERS YOU LIKE ANY SMALL CRACKERS 
THEY'RE MIXED IN WITH THE CHILLI 
CINCINNATI FASHION 
THEN YOU JUST GO IN WITH YOUR FORK 
EAT SEE WHAT YOU LIKE A BIT MORE 
AND THEN ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS IT'S VERY GOOD 
TODAY'S THE BIG DAY BECAUSE WE'RE FINALLY OPENING OUR NEW RESTAURANT 
WE'VE INVITED STAFF FRIENDS AND FAMILY 
TO CELEBRATE AND SAMPLE THE MENU 
AND I'M VERY LUCKY BECAUSE MICHELIN STARRED CHEF MARCO PIERRE WHITE HAS COME TO OPEN IT 
WHAT DO I DO FOR LOVE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE WOULD DO THIS FOR US IT'S NOT EXACTLY HIS TYPE OF RESTAURANT 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE MET MARCO SO I'M WONDERING WHAT HE WILL THINK ABOUT CHEATING 
IT'S NOT HOW TO COOK IT'S HOW TO COOK WHEN YOU'RE BUSY 
IT'S HOW TO COOK WHEN YOU HAVEN'T GOT TIME 
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS WORLD BY MAKING THEIR BOOKS SO COMPLICATED 
THANK YOU SO THERE'S THE BIRD AT HOME COOKING A DINNER PARTY FOR THE BANK MANAGER AND HER HUSBAND FOR SIX 
AND SHE'S NOW TRYING TO REPLICATE WHAT THAT PICTURE IS ON SIX PLATES IT'S A LUNACY 
COOKING ON TELEVISION AND CHEFS HAS BECOME EXCLUSIVE YOU KNOW THAT COOKING BELONGS TO CHEFS 
AND IT DOESN'T BELONG TO CHEFS IT BELONGS AT HOME AS WELL 
LET'S NOT FORGET FOOD COOKING IT'S NOT A RECIPE IT'S A PHILOSOPHY 
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER 
KETCHUP FANTASTIC 
IT CAN BE USED IN MANY WAYS IT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH IT 
YOU SEE WHERE I'M COMING FROM AND I THINK BE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHAT YOU TAKE FROM THE SUPERMARKET SHELVES 
I DID THIS INTERVIEW THE OTHER WEEK 
THEY SAID MARCO YOU LOVE BOTTLES YOU LOVE SUPERMARKETS 
I SAID YES I LOVE AN AISLE THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN MARRIED THREE TIMES 
OH YEAH WE'VE GOT TO CUT THE RIBBON I FORGOT STEADY 
GOOD LUCK 
LOVE YOU GIRL I CAN SEE WHERE DELIA GOT HER CHARM FROM OH REALLY 
ALL FROM YOU DARLING GOOD 
I'M GLAD SHE GOT SOMETHING FROM ME 
SHE GOT LOTS FROM YOU 
ONE THING I'VE ALWAYS LOVED ABOUT DELIA IS HOW PROFESSIONAL SHE IS 
HOW SHE DELIVERS HER MESSAGE 
IT'S ABOUT BEING A REALIST AT HOME 
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME 
BECAUSE I'VE GOT ANOTHER JOB 
SO HOW CAN I COOK SOMETHING DELICIOUS WITHIN TEN MINUTES FOR THE WIFE FOR THE FAMILY 
IT'S ALL ABOUT EATING AND EATING WELL 
IF YOU'VE HAD A NICE SPICY CHILLI WITH SOME FRIENDS WHAT COULD BE BETTER TO SERVE AS A DESSERT 
THAN A COOLING CREAM OF COCONUT PIE THE REAL AMERICAN TYPE 
I'VE GOT A RECIPE TO SHOW YOU NOW FOR COCONUT CREAM PIE THAT DOESN'T 
ACTUALLY NEED ANY BAKING WHICH IS QUITE SOMETHING 
WE START OFF WITH THE MAIN INGREDIENT HERE 
WHICH IS A TIN OF CREAM OF COCONUT 
IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY EXCITING AT ALL BUT WHEN YOU GIVE A GOOD SNIFF 
YOU CAN SMELL FRESH COCONUT 
IT'S MIXED WITH CANE SUGAR AND MADE INTO A THICK SYRUP AND IT'S WHAT'S 
USED TRADITIONALLY TO MAKE A DRINK CALLED PINA COLADA A COCKTAIL 
BUT WE'RE USING IT IN A PIE AND I'M GOING TO MAKE THE BASE OF THE PIE FIRST IN A SAUCEPAN 
I'VE GOT HERE SOME CORNFLOUR 
AND THEN IT'S CALLED COCONUT AND LIME PIE SO I'VE GOT SOME LIME JUICE 
THAT'S THE JUICE OF TWO LIMES AND THE GRATED ZEST OF TWO LIMES AS WELL 
I'M GOING TO HEAT IT UP 
WITH SOME WATER 
HERE I'VE GOT TWO BEATEN EGGS THEY'RE GOING TO GO IN AS WELL 
AND THEN YOU JUST KEEP WHISKING UNTIL THAT COMES UP TO BOILING POINT 
AS SOON AS THAT'S REALLY THICK 
LIKE THAT YOU CAN SEE HOW THICK THAT IS 
THEN WE ADD OUR CREAM OF COCONUT 
NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT OVER 
BECAUSE WHAT I WANT IS FOR IT TO COOL 
THERE WE GO NOW IT'S GOING TO HAVE SOME DESICCATED COCONUT IN 
FOLD THAT IN 
IT'S A BIT LOOSE AT THE MOMENT 
BUT IT'LL THICKEN UP AS IT COOLS AND THEN IT'LL BE READY 
TO GO INTO THE PIE 
THE BEST NEWS WITH THIS RECIPE 
I SAID NO BAKING IS THAT WE'VE GOT A READY BAKED PASTRY CASE HERE 
THAT'S A GREAT BIG BIT OF COOKING THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAS DONE FOR YOU 
ALL GOOD COCONUT PIES HAVE CREAM 
THIS IS HALF A PINT 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WHIP UP CREAM AT ALL 
YOU COULD USE CREME FRAICHE WHICH IS ALL READY TO SPREAD 
THAT'S VERY NICE TOO BUT IN AMERICA THEY USE DOUBLE CREAM 
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M USING TODAY 
YOU CAN SEE THAT IS JUST TO THE FLOPPY STAGE 
NOT STIFF AS IT'LL BE DIFFICULT TO SPREAD SO NOW I'M GOING 
TO PUT THE REST OF THE COCONUT IN 
IN THE SAUCE I'VE GOT HALF THE COCONUT WHICH WAS ONE TEN G. 
AND NOW I'M PUTTING THE OTHER HALF IN 
JUST A BIT OF WHISKING UNTIL IT BEGINS TO LOOK THICKER AND THEN STOP THAT'S IT 
NOW WITH THE COCONUT FIRST 
THAT GOES IN FIRST 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO SPREAD THE CREAM 
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE AND LEAVE IT 
FOR AT LEAST THREE HOURS TO FIRM UP 
BUT THAT'S NICE BECAUSE IF YOU'VE GOT FRIENDS COMING OVER IT'S ALL DONE AND DUSTED 
AND ALL YOU DO WHEN YOU WANT TO EAT IT IS JUST WHIP IT OUT OF THE FRIDGE AND OFF YOU GO 
UNDER THE SEA 
LET THERE BE WIND 
I WANT YOU BACK BY THE JACKSON FIVE 
OH BABY I WAS BLIND TO LET YOU GO 
BUT NOW SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU IN HER ARMS 
I WANT YOU BACK 
INTRODUCING THE JACKSON FIVE
