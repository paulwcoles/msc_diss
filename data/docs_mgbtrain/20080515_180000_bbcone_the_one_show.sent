HARDEEPSINGH KOHLI AND MIRANDA 
KRESTOVNIKOFF KRESTOVNIKOFF CHERIE BLAIR'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS 
OUT TODAY BUT WHAT DID IT ADD TO 
THE 
BLAIR YEARS NOT A LOT IS THE 
GENERAL VIEW OF THE CRITICS WHO SAY 
IT'S A HYMN TO HER HUSBAND MY MUM SAID TO 
ME NEVER WASH YOUR DIRTY LAUNDRY 
IN PUBLIC MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE 
LISTENED TO HER BECAUSE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE HAVE MADE A LOT OF MONEY 
FROM DOING THAT SORRY WHATEVER 
MEMORIES ARE MADE OF THERE IS 
MONEY TO BE MADE IN REMEMBERING 
THEM LAST YEAR ALONE MEMORYS 
GENERATED SALES OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION 
SURELY POLITICIANS DON'T DO IT FOR 
THE DOSH OR DO THEY LET'S BE 
HONEST ONE OF THE REASONS 
POLITICIAN WRITE MEMOIRS IS THE 
MONEY YOU HAVEN'T GOT DOWNING 
STREET TO LIVE IN A MILLION OUR 
FIVE COMES IN HANDY THERE IS ALSO 
REVENGE PEOPLE WANT TO GET THEIR 
OWN BACK ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
UNKIND AND FINE THERE ARE 
IMPORTANT THING THAT ONLY YOU KNOW 
THAT YOU WANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD 
IT'S A MIXTURE OF THE SERIOUS THE 
GOSSIPY AND SHEER GREED WELL 
WHATEVER THEY GOT UP TO IN THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS THE DIRT WE WANT 
DISHING UP IN IS IN THE HOUSE OF 
CELEBRITY ONCE UPON A TIME THE 
SHOWBIZ MEMORY MEANT YOU HAD A LIVE 
IN SHOWBIZ LIKE AT DAVID NIVEN 
MICHAEL PALIN EVEN WILLIAM SHOTER 
IN KNOW ANY TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD 
FOOTBALLER CAN GHOST WRITE A 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY EVEN HIS MISSUS CAN 
DO A WAGSS TO RICHES 
IF WAYNE 
WANTS TO COMPLEMENT ME HE WILL 
BUT THAT IS RARE HE DOESN'T GET AS 
PASSIONATE ABOUT CLOTHES AS FASHION 
AS I DO 
IF YOU CAN'T BEAT THE CELEBRITIES 
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN THEM JUST WHEN 
YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD MISSED YOUR 
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A BESTSELLER 
WRITTEN ABOUT YOU A NEW PUBLISHING 
PHENOMENON MEANS YOU CAN HAVE 
MODERN MEMORY THEY ARE WRITING 
THEM ABOUT ORDINARY PEOPLE LOUISE 
MILLER HELPS PUBLISH PEOPLE'S LIVES 
I AM PART OF A NEW INDUSTRY OF 
JOURNALIST SETTING UP BUSINESSES TO 
WRITE PEOPLE'S MEMORYS 
I DON'T 
MEAN TO BE RUDE BUT THERE ARE SOME 
DULL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD 
EVEN IF 
YOU ARE SEVENTY YEARS OLD AND LIVED IN 
THE SAME HOUSE ALL YOUR LIFE YOU 
HAVE MARRIED THE SAME PERSON AND 
DONE A JOB THE FACT YOU HAVE LIVED 
THROUGH A WAR OR WHAT IT FELT THE 
FIRST TIME YOU SAW A PLANE THESE 
ARE ALREADY EXTRAORDINARY 
EXPERIENCES EXPERIENCES YOU ARE SAYING TO ME THAT NO ONE IS 
BORING NO 
YOU HAVE NOT MET MY BORING NO UNCLE UNCLE TOMORROW AND DOROTHY ARE ONE 
ORDINARY COUPLE WHO HAVE PUT THEIR 
EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCES IN PRINT 
DO YOU THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
LEAVE SOMETHING BEHIND FOR YOUR 
LOVED ONES 
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT 
MY PARENTS CAME FROM ABROAD THERE 
WERE A LOT OF THINGS I NEVER ASKED 
THEM NOW IT'S TOO LATE TOM WROTE 
HIS FIRST AND WHEN I READ THE DRAFT 
I THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE TO WRITE 
MINE BECAUSE IT WAS INACCURATE 
FROM THE WAY I THOUGHT EVEN THE 
WAY WE MET WASN'T CORRECT IT'S A 
QUESTION OF WHOSE MEMORY IS CORRECT 
IS YOURS CORRECT OR HERS 
MINE IS THE ACCURATE ONE 
THERE DOES SEEM TO BE STREAM OF 
BOOKS LIKE CHERIE BLAIR WHO CAN 
NEVER DO ANYTHING WRITE AS FAR AS 
CRITICS ARE CONCERNED LORD LEVY 
JOHN PRESCOTT ARE YOU NOT 
INTERESTED 
I AM MORE INTERESTED IN INTERESTED POLITICAL MEMORYS THAT IS EXPOSURE 
TO LIFE BEHIND THE SCENES 
THIS IS 
WHAT CHERIE BLAIR'S BOOK WAS 
SUPPOSED TO DO 
WHAT I AM LESS 
TOLERANT IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
ACHIEVED NOTHING AND DONE NOTHING 
WHO WASTE TREES ON BIKES BASICALLY 
BOOKS WHAT ARE WE GO GOING TO 
FIND OUT ABOUT MRS. WAYNE ROONEY BY 
READING THE MAGAZINES SHE APPEARS 
IN 
BUT THERE LIFE IS PROBABLY JUST IN AS FASCINATING AS JOHN PRESCOTT'S 
I THINK MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE 
THEY SPENT LESS TIME IN THE PUBLIC 
EYE AND EXPOSED 
DOROTHY HAD A FASHION NAITING LIFE 
SOCIAL WORK E. INVOLVED IN THE C. N. D. 
STUFF THAT IS BECOME LESS AND LESS 
AROUND JUST NOW THAT WE CAN STILL 
LEARN FROM 
YOUR MEMORYS WILL BE AN EXCELLENT 
READ HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT 
PUBLISHERS HAVE ASKED ME SOMETIMES 
WHEN I AM LYING IN BED I RUN 
THROUGH MY LIFE BUT I TEND TO FALL 
ASLEEP BY THE TIME I HAVE LEFT 
SCHOOL SCHOOL DON'T JOIN THE MARKETING CAMPAIGN 
OF YOUR BOOK 
MOST OF THE TIME IT 
CEASES TO HAVE A SPELLBINDING 
WOULD IT BE HARD TO WRITE YOU HAVE 
THESE FANTASTICAL FLIGHTS OF FANCY 
WOULD IT BE DIFFICULT TO WRITE 
FACT YUL BOOK 
THE FLIGHTS OF FANCY 
ARE ARE IN MY HEAD L. HAVE BEEN 
TOLD THE WAY TO DO IT IS MAKE STUFF 
UP THE MISSING YEAR OF YOUR LIFE 
WHEN YOU WERE WORKING ON A WHALER 
I AM BUSY LIVING IT 
YOU WERE 
SAYING ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS EVERY 
TOM DICK AND HARRY IS WRITING THEM 
MY BOOK IS CALLED INDIAN TAKEAWAY 
IS AVAILABLE IN BOOKSHOPS 
THAT IS AGAINST BROADCASTING RULES 
FAIR ENOUGH IT'S ALSO NOT TA GOOD 
AT THE OTHER END OF THE LITERALLY 
SPECK DRUM DISWORLD HAS SOLD OVER FIVE 
MILLION BOOKS OF LATE A COUPLE HAVE BEEN MADE INTO T. V. MOVIES 
FABULOUS TERRY DID YOU KNOW 
BECAUSE OF DISCWORLD YOU ARE THE 
BIGGEST SHOP LIFTING AUTHOR COULD COULD YOU PROVE IT 
WELL THESE ARE FIGURES 
THAT WAS LISHED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WE 
ARE BANG UP TO DATE HERE WHAT DO 
YOU THINK APPEALS TO SHOPTLIFTERS 
I DON'T KNOW L. SUPPOSE THE POLICE 
ASK THEM WHEN THEY CATCH THEM L. 
HOPED I TRY AND MAKE THEM 
ENTERTAINING AND SOMETIMES 
THOUGHTFUL AND THE THING ABOUT THE 
POPULARITY OF GENRES IS THAT THEY 
TEND TO BE WRITTEN IN AN OLD 
FASHIONED WAY THEY HAVE PLOT AND 
CHARACTER AND THEY ADHERE TO THE 
OLD FASHIONED RULES OF STORYTELLING 
TERRY BELIEVE IT OR NOT HAS BEEN 
DIAGNOSED WITH EARLY ONSET 
ALZHEIMER'S THAT IS WHEN THE 
DISEASE EFFECTS YOU BEFORE THE AGE 
OF SIXTY FIVE DOCTORS SAY IT'S A CONDITION 
SET TO BECOME MORE COMMON OVER THE 
NEXT TEN YEARS YET THE N. H. S. HAS CUT 
VITAL TREATMENT PROVEN TO WORK FOR 
MIDDLE AGED SUFFERERS LUCY SIEGLE 
SPENT THE DAY WITH REMARKABLE 
WOMAN WHOSE STORY WILL BE FAMILIAR 
TO TERRY 
MEET HEATHER ROBERTS LIKE TERRY 
PRATCHETT SHE IS ONE OF THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
PEOPLE IN THE U. K. WHO HAVE EARLY 
ONSET ALZHEIMER'S EARLIER THIS 
YEAR TERRY DONATESED HALF 
MILLION POUNDS TOWARDS RESEARCH 
INTO THE DISEASE 
I WANTED TO FIGHT 
THE DISEASE IT WAS SIMPLE IT WAS 
A SHEER VIE CAROUS SENSE OF I WANT 
TO HIT BACK IN SOME WAY THIS END 
OF THE DAY I AM UP AND READY AND I 
AM SENSIBLE AND FINE EVERYTHING IS 
WORKING FINE 
HEATHER HAS ALWAYS 
PLAYED TENNIS BUT PRACTISE 
SESSIONS ARE A CRUCIAL PART OF HER 
AIM TO MAINTAIN NORMALITY AS THE 
ALZHEIMER'S TAKES HOLD L. JOINED 
HER AND HUSBAND DAVE ON THE COURT 
SO HET IRER YOU WEREN'T 
INTIMIDATED BY MY DREFUL GAME YOU 
ARE A GOOD PLAYER 
I USED TO BE A 
GOOD PLAYER IT'S ONLY 
INDICATIONALLY YOU SEE GLIMPSES OF 
THAT WHEN EVERYTHING WORKS A LOT 
OF THE TIME IT'S SORT OF ALL OVER 
THE PLACE OR THE RACKET GOES OVER 
THE COURT OR I MISS THE BALL AND 
THE TIMING IS WRONG THAT IS ALL 
PART OF THE ALZIRMS AND THE WAY IT 
EFFECT MESS 
ALZHEIMER'S 
THERE ARE SEVEN THOUSAND SUFFERERS OF 
DEMENTIA IN THE U. K. AS SOCIETY AGES 
THIS WILL INCREASE 
TENNIS IS ABOUT 
GETTING THE FACT ORS RIGHT BUT 
MOST OF THE TIME I CAN'T MANAGE 
THAT MY BRAIN IS TRYING TO GET THE 
BITS RIGHT AND OFTEN I MISS THE 
SHOT ALTOGETHER 
DO YOUIFIED THAT FRUSTRATING YES YES FIND THAT FRUSTRATING YES VERY 
FRUSTRATING FRUSTRATING DID YOU USED TO BE DOUBLES 
PARTNERS 
I AM A NEW BOY TO THIS PARTNERS GAME I STARTED PLAYING WHEN I 
FINISHED WORK REALLY TO DO 
SOMETHING WITH HEATHER SHE IS 
STILL FAR BETTER THAN ME EVEN 
THOUGH SHE IS NOT AS GOOD AS SHE 
USED TO BE 
IS IT DIFFICULT TO COME DOWN HERE 
AND ADMIT YOU NOW HAVE A WEAKNESS 
I THINK MIDDLE EAST PEOPLE HAVE 
SPOTTED THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG 
WHEN I HIT THE BALL ASTRAY DOI 
TALK ABOUT IT OPENLY SOME PEOPLE 
DON'T WANT TO KNOW SOME PEOPLE 
WALK AWAY OTHER PEOPLE ARE 
INTERESTED TO TALK ABOUT IT AND TO 
EXPLAIN MY SEEMINGLY BIZARRE 
BEHAVIOUR WHEN I INSIST ON THROWING 
MY RACKET ACROSS THE COURT 
YOU ARE NOT BEING JOHN MCENROE WE WE HAVE A GOOD GIGGLE SOME OF IT IS 
SILLY EVERYONE JUST BURSTS OUT 
LAUGHING THAT IS THE WAY TO DEAL 
WITH IT 
LAUGHTER IS A KEY BEING ABLE TO 
LAUGH AT MYSELF AND LAUGH AT THE 
SITUATION MAKES LIFE MORE BEARABLE 
AND GIVES ME I FEEL A BETTER 
QUALITY OF LIFE 
HEATHER RECKONS SHE CAN MAIN AIN AN 
ACTIVE LIFESTYLE BECAUSE OF THE 
ARICEPT DRUG SHE TAKES HETER IS 
LUCKY SHE GOT THESE DRUGS ON THE 
N. H. S. BUT FOR RECENTLY DIAGNOSED 
SUFFERERS LIKE TERRY PRATCHETT THEY 
ARE NO LONGER ENTITLED TO THEM 
TERRY HAS TO FUND HIS DRUGS OUT OF 
HIS OWN POCKET WHY HAVE THEY 
CLOSED THE DOOR 
THE N. H. S. STILL APPROVES THEIR USE 
FOR PEOPLE IN THE LATER STAGES A 
LEADING DEMENTIA SPECIALIST THINKS 
THEY CAN HAVE BENEFITS TO ALL WHAT WHAT PEOPLE DO FOR SOME PEOPLE FOR A 
YEAR TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS IS TO EXERCISE 
SOME BENEFIT ON MEMORY AND 
CONCENTRATION CONCENTRATION EVEN THAT IS BUYING BIT OF TIME 
FOR SOME PATIENTS A YEAR OR 
HOWEVER LONG IT MAY BE ISN'T THAT 
CRUCIAL 
I THINKS IT L. THINK IT IS CRUCIAL WHAT THESE DRUGS GAVE WERE HOPE TO 
EVERYBODY EVERYBODY ALZHEIMER'S DOESN'T JUST EFFECT 
THOSE DIAGNOSED THE EFFECT RIPPLES 
OUT TO HEATHER'S FAMILY OF YOU 
HAVEN'T ALWAYS GONE SHOPPING 
TOGETHER 
NO I YOU USED TO TOGETHER DISAPPEAR INTO TOWN ON YOUR OWN L. 
USED TO THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WHAP WHAP DO YOU DO ABOUT MONEY 
SPEND IT 
ALL SPEND IT IS THAT DIFFICULT 
ARE YOU AWARE OF HOW MUCH YOU ARE 
SPENDING AND KEEPING TABS ON IT I I HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO LOST TRACK AND 
NOT TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF 
MONEY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I 
WILL CHECK WITH FRANCIS IS THIS 
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THIS 
THING BECAUSE I HAVE LOST THE 
ABILITY TO DEAL WITH THAT 
WHEN WE GO OUT I USED TO TAKE OVER 
THAT IS WHEN YOU SEE THE ROLE 
REVERSAL MUM WOULD ALWAYS HAVE 
DAEMENT WITH T. SHE WOULD GO IF YOU 
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR THAT IT'S 
NOW ME SAYING HAVE YOU ENOUGH CASH 
ON YOU 
YOU HAVE HAD TO REPLAN LOT OF 
YOUR LIFE AND SPEND A LOT MORE TIME 
TOGETHER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE DONE 
NATURALLY 
IT'S DEFINITELY BROUGHT NATURALLY US CLOSER TOGETHER IT GIVES YOU 
THE FRAME OF MIND WHAT IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN IN TEN YEARS YOU ARE NOT 
GOING TO HAVE THIS MOMENT AGAIN IN 
TEN YEARS TIME YOUR MUM IS NOT 
GOING TO BE THE PERSON YOU KNOW 
RIGHT NOW THAT IS HARD TO ACCEPT 
IT'S THE END OF THE DAY AND HEATHER 
IS BACK AT HOME WITH HER FAMILY 
ALZHEIMER'S IS SOMETHING THEY HAVE 
ALL HAD TO DEAL WITH AS MORE AND 
MORE PEOPLE ARE TOUCHED BY THE 
DISEASE HEATHER BELIEVES A NEW 
OPENNESS IS NEEDED 
WE HAVE TALK 
ABOUT THIS L. AM GOING TO FIGHT 
THIS ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE ARE 
SOME DAYS YOU CAN'T COUNT IT SO 
SKRU TO GIVE IN GRACEFULLY BUT 
MOST OF THE TIME I AM GOING TO 
FIGHT IT ALL THE WAY 
TERRY YOU 
SAW HEATHER TAKING A DETERMINEDLY 
CHEERFUL APPROACH IS THAT SOMETHING 
YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO 
THE DAY AFTER I WAS DIAGNOSED AND I 
WAS WORKING IN THE GARDEN AND I 
REALISED I WAS WHISTLING L. HAVE A 
NATURAL CHEERFULNESS WHICH BUBBLES 
TO THE TOP AS I SAID IN THE FILM 
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING L. PHONED 
UP THE ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH TRUST 
AND TALK 
TO THEM L. SAID I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU A MILLION DOLLARS 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW IT IS YOU 
COME BACK FROM THE STATES YOU HAVE 
BEEN ASLEEP ON THE PLANE WHEN THE 
ENVELOPE COMES AROUND AND YOU HAVE 
A FEW DOLLARS LEFT IN YOUR POCKET 
I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO GIVE AWAY 
ONE MILLION DOLLARS SUDDENLY EVERYONE WAS 
TALKING ABOUT IT EVERYONE WAS SO 
SURPRISED THAT SOMEONE WAS GOING TO 
OWN UP TO HAVING ALZHEIMER'S BUT 
THERE IS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF 
YOU WERE MISDIAGNOSED 
IT WASN'T ANYONE'S FAULT HAVE 
RARE VARIANT WHICH IS WHY I CAN 
STILL WRITE THE BOOKS BUT THE 
TYPING IS HARD THE FOREFRONT THE 
BIT THAT IS ME IS WORKING QUITE 
WELL LONG MAY THAT CONTINUE YOU 
MAKE UP WORK AROUNDS BUT I CAN'T 
DRIVE A CAR BECAUSE MY VISUAL 
ACUITY IS ASKEW L. MIGHT NOT SEE MY 
MOBILE PHONE IF IT'S ON THE TABLE 
YOU CAN'T DRIVE A CAR IN THAT CASE 
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT SEE A LITTLE 
GIRL ON A ZEBRA CROSSING 
WITH THE DRUGS WHAT ARE THE 
OPTIONS 
THERE ARE THREE DRUGS OPTIONS LICENSED FOR MODERATE ALZHEIMER'S 
AND THREE FOR MORE SEVERE THINGS 
THE INTERESTING THING IS THERE IS 
STILL A BIT OF A POST CODE LOTTERY 
N. SCOTLAND THEY HAVE BEEN LICENSED 
FROM AN EARLY STAGE AND PEOPLE THEY 
HAVE SAID PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE 
DENIED THESE DRUGS WHEN THEY CAN 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE THEY DON'T WORK 
FOR EVERYONE BUT I HAVE SEVERAL 
PATIENTS THEY HAVE DONE MIRACULOUS 
THINGS 
IT'S NOT JUST THE PATIENTS THINGS IT'S FAMILIES AS WELL ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE MOVING 
TOWARDS IS LOOKING AFTER THE CARERS 
IF YOU ARE LOOKING AFTER SOMEONE 
WITH ALZHEIMER'S YOU ARE DOING IT 
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF YOUR 
LIFELONG PARTNER 
WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR YOU 
I AM NOT PAYING TOO MUCH ATTENTION 
TO IT FOR TWO REASONS ONE THE BOOK 
HAVE BEEN KIND A. R. SHALL I SAY MY 
READERS HAVE BEEN KIND MY FUTURE 
WILL NOT INCLUDE LACK OF MONEY I DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW SCRIPT 
WHAT SEEMS LIKE A NIGHTMARE FROM 
THE OUTSIDE CAN BE ONE DAY AT A 
TIME FROM THE INSIDE YOU FIND 
PLENTY OF PEOPLE AND NEW THINGS TO 
DO KEEP ACTIVE AND DON'T SIT THERE 
FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF WENT 
THROUGH LITTLE PHASE OF THAT 
UNTIL I REALISED THAT AT FIFTY NINE I WAS 
QUITE AN ELDERLY EARLY ON SET AND 
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THEIR FORTIES AND 
THOSE PEOPLE DO NEED THE FREE 
MEDICATION I CAN AFFORD IT THEY 
CAN'T 
I WOULD LISTEN TO YOU ALL CAN'T EVENING YOU MUST SAY IF YOU WANT 
TO KNOW MORE THERE IS INFORMATION 
ON THE WEBSITE CAN WHAT IS THE 
STRANGEST CREATURE YOU HAVE WRITTEN 
ABOUT 
ONE CALL THE AM BIG EWE ABOUT AMBIGUOUS PAZOOMA AND IT COULD 
TRAVEL VERY FAST BUT BECAUSE OF 
THE SPEED OF LIGHT IT EITHER KNEW 
WHERE IT WAS GOING OR WHO IT WAS 
BUT NOT BOTH AT THE SAME TIME HERE HERE ON THE ONE SHOW WE LIKE TO GET UP 
CLOSE AND PERSONAL TO SOME EQUALLY 
STRANGE CREATURES MIRANDA HAVE 
BEEN TAILING A GARDENER'S FRIEND 
BRITAIN'S MOST LAID BACK LOUNGE 
LIZARD CARDIFF BAY HAS BEEN 
TRANSFORMED OVER THE LAST DECADE 
INTO A FAST PACED BUSINESS AND 
CULTURAL CENTRE FOR THE CAPITAL 
CITY OF WALES BUT FEWER THAN FOUR 
MILES OFFSHORE THE PACE OF LIFE IS 
DEFINITELY SLOW THESE TWO ISLANDS 
BEHIND ME NESTLE IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE BRISTOL CHANNEL THIS IS FLAT 
HOME IS WALES' MOST SOUTHERLY POINT 
FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS HAS BEEN 
DESIGNATED A SITE OF SPECIAL 
SCIENTIFIC INTEREST FOR THE RARE 
CRASSS GRASSES AND COLONIES OF 
OVER EIGHT THOUSAND SEAGULLS I'M NOT HERE 
FOR THEM BUT TO FIND A SECRETIVE 
REPTILE THAT IS ON THE MOVE IN MAY 
THE SLOW WORMS SPEND TIME OUT OF 
SIGHT SO THEY ARE VERY HARD TO 
STUDY WENDY MURRAY IS ONE OF THE 
WARDENS AND LUCKILY FOR ME SHE 
KNOWS ALL THE HOT SPOTS AS SHE HAS 
TO SURVEY THE POPULATION EVERY 
MONTH WITH TWENTY SITES TO SCAN I'M 
HOPING WE WILL UNEARTH SOMETHING 
SPECTACULAR YES 
LOOK AT THAT SPECTACULAR YES ISN'T HE LOVELY MAGIC 
THAT IS A MAGIC BIT OF A PRIZE 
EVERYBODY THINKS 
THEY ARE SNAKES THAT IS THE BIG 
THING ABOUT THEM 
THE LIZARD HAS 
EYELIDS THAT IS THE 
DISTINGUISHABLE FEATURE THEY WILL 
LOSE THEIR TALE TAIL AS A DEFENCE 
MECHANISM 
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY MECHANISM BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL CREATURES HOW 
OLD DO THEY LIVE TO 
ABOUT TWENTY YEARS 
THEY ARE OUR LONGEST LIVING REPTILE 
IN THE U. K. 
MOST PEOPLE ARE UNAWARE 
THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THEM IN THE 
GARDEN ABSOLUTELY 
SLOW WORMS LOVE GARDEN ABSOLUTELY TO EAT SLUGS AND SNAILS SO THEY CAN 
BE THE GARDENER'S BEST FRIEND IF 
YOU WANTED TO ATTRACT THEM TO YOUR 
GARDEN WE HAVE GOT CARPET TILES ON 
OUR LAWN 
YES ANYTHING THAT IS 
FLAT AGAINST THE GROUND BASICALLY 
THESE WOODEN BOARDS AND METAL 
SHEETS HEAT UP IN THE SUN ALLOWING 
THE COLD BLOODED REPTILES TO WARM 
UP SAFELY OUT OF SIGHT OF PREDATORY 
GULLS FLAT HOME WAS CONNECTED TO 
THE MAINLAND AND WE THINK THAT SLOW 
WORMS WERE MAROONED WHEN SEA LEVELS 
ROSE AT THE END OF THE LAST ICE AGE 
TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO ANOTHER POTENTIAL 
SITE FINGERS CROSSED 
THIS MIGHT 
BE QUITE HEAVY 
WOW HOW MANY HAVE 
WE GOT THERE 
WOW ABOUT TWENTY I'VE I'VE GOT THREE 
I'VE GOT ONE FANTASTIC FANTASTIC GOD THAT WAS AMAZING UNDER THERE 
IF I PUT THIS IS THE FEMALE YES YES WITH THE STRIPE 
YOU CAN SEE THE 
BLACK STRIPE GOING ALL THE WAY DOWN 
THE SIDES THIS IS A MALE MUCH 
MORE UNIFORM IN COLOUR WITH THE 
LOVELY BLUE SPOTS 
YES ALONG HIM 
AS WELL 
YOU MANAGED TO CATCH A 
JUVENILE AS WELL THAT IS JUST 
FANTASTIC AS AN ADULT MALE WHO IS 
ABSOLUTELY HUGE WITH AN ENORMOUS 
HEAD HE IS MASSIVE COMPARED TO THE 
SMALL JUVENILE WE HAVE A WHOLE 
FAMILY IT'S GREAT IT SEEMS EARLY 
TO FIND A JUVENILE IN MAY L. 
THOUGHT THEY BRED IN MAY 
THERE HAS 
BEEN EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT IN 
FACT IF THEY BREED LATER IN THE 
YEAR THEY CAN IN FACT HIBERNATE AND 
GIVE BIRTH WHILST WHEN THEY COME 
OUT OF HIBERNATION 
I CAME HERE 
BECAUSE OF THE SHEER ABUNDANCE OF 
SLOW WORMS AND THEY ARE EASY TO 
FIND YOU MIGHT HAVE THEM ON YOUR 
BACK DOORSTEP AND NOT KNOW IT THEY 
LOVE TO HIDE IN COMPOST HEAPS THEY 
LIKE THE SLUGS AND SNAILS FROM THE 
GARDENS IT IS INCREDIBLE TO THINK 
THEY HAVE SURVIVED ON THIS TINY 
OUTPOST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
BRISTOL CHANNEL FOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS 
AND SURPRISING TO THINK THEY ARE 
PROVIDING US WITH A NATURAL PEST 
CONTROL WITHOUT US REALLY BEING 
AWARE OF IT NEXT TIME YOU ARE 
RAKING THROUGH THE LEAVES JUST KEEP 
AN EYE OUT FOR THE WONDERFULLY 
MYSTERIOUS AND VERY SECRETIVE SLOW 
WORMS MIRANDA IS HERE AND SOME OF 
THE SLOW WORMS VERY AT HOME THEY 
ARE PROTECTED 
THEY ARE IF ANY 
BUILDING CONSTRUCTION WORK IS GOING 
ON IN THIS COUNTRY SURVEYS HAVE TO 
BE DONE AND IF THERE ARE SLOW WORMS 
THEY HAVE TO BE ROUNDED UP AND 
REHONED IT IS IMPORTANT WE LOOK 
AFTER OUR REPTILES WE ONLY HAVE 
SIX NATIVE PEP TILES SLOW WORMS 
ARE NOT THAT COMMON 
TERRY WOULD 
YOU LIKE ONE TO HOLD 
WE HAVE THEM 
IN THE GARDEN 
THEY ARE A 
GARDENER'S BEST FRIEND 
THEY ARE 
YOU SHOULD LOOK AFTER THEM 
WE HAVE 
GOT THEM AND THE THING IS THEY LOVE 
TO FEED ON SLUGS AND SNAILS AND 
THINGS LIKE THAT SO IF YOU FIND 
ONE DON'T BE SCARED OR THINK IT'S A 
SNAKE THEY ARE A REALLY GREAT 
THING TO HAVE AND THEY LOVE COMPOST 
HEAPS 
EVOLUTION IT DOESN'T SEEM HEAPS WISE TO LOSE THE LEGS THEY ARE 
BETTER THAN SLIDING ALONG SO WHY 
LOSE THEM 
THEY LIKE HIDING 
UNDERNEATH AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
SKELETON OF A SLOW WORM IT DOES 
HAVE LIMBS SO THEY DID HAVE LEGS 
ONCE UPON A TIME THEY LIKE HIDING 
AND THE LEGS GOT IN THE WAY SO 
THEY EVOLVED TO LOSE THEM AND 
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE ENDED UP HOW 
THEY ARE NOW 
LOVELY TO SEE YOU AND 
YOUR WORMS CAN I ASK YOU TO DO 
SOMETHING FOR US SEE THIS WE PAY 
TRIBUTE TO THE POTATO ALL HAIL 
I AM BRINGING YOU ALL BACK TO 
IRELAND WITH ME BECAUSE WE ALL 
LOVE THEM THERE ALL WEEK WE HAVE 
BEEN GOING CRAZY THE SERIES 
HIGHLIGHTED THE REMARKABLE 
PROPERTIES OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY 
VEGETABLE LAST NIGHT WE SHOWED YOU 
VARIETIES LAST NIGHT SHINI 
SOMARATHNE COULD SHOW US HOW IT 
COULD SAVE THE PLANET MOST OF US 
WOULD HAVE LEARNT TO MAKE A POTATO 
BATTERY THAT POWERS SOMETHING LIKE 
A SMALL CLOCK BUT IT HAS ANOTHER 
SIDE A SIDE SO INCREDIBLE THAT THE 
FUTURE OF MANUFACTURING MAY DEPEND 
ON IT THE U. K. THROWS AWAY NEARLY THREE 
MILLION TONNES OF PLASTIC EACH YEAR 
NINETY PER CENT ENDS UP IN LANDFILL WHERE IT 
CAN REMAIN FOR DECADES OR EVEN 
CENTURIES POTATO STARCH IS A 
BIOPOLYMER WHICH LOOKS LIKE THIS 
AND THIS IS A SIMILAR STRUCTURE TO 
CONVENTIONAL PLASTICS SO IN THEORY 
WHEREVER YOU USE DISPOSABLE PLASTIC 
YOU COULD USE POTATO STARCH INSTEAD 
ESTABLISHED OVER SEVEN YEARS AGO 
THIS IS ONE OF THE COMPANIES IN THE 
U. K. MAKING PLASTIC FROM POTATOS 
POTATOES WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE 
MIXTURES THAT YOU PUT INTO 
PACKAGING WHAT DO WE NEED SOME SOME STARCH 
CHIEF SCIENTIST ROB BERRY STARCH BUYS DRIED POTATO STARCH TO MAKE 
THE PLASTICS BUT EVENTUALLY WANTS 
TO RECYCLE FROM CHIP FACTORIES 
PUTTING THE WATER IN NOW THIS IS 
WHAT TURNS IT INTO A MASH 
IT LOOKS 
LIKE PANCAKE MIX 
BASICALLY IT IS 
CAN WE EAT IT 
NO WOULDN'T 
RECOMMEND EATING IT YOU CAN EAT IT 
OF COURSE 
THAT IS SO LOVELY SO 
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT 
IT IS READY TO 
PUMP INTO THE MOLD 
THERE WE HAVE 
IT WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING THE THE BATCH IS BEING DEPOSITED IN THE 
MOLD 
YOU CAN SEE IT YOU HAVE GOT 
TO GET RID OF ALL THE WATER IN THE 
MIXTURE THERE IS YOUR FINISHED 
PLATE WOW LOOK AT THAT NICE AND 
WARM YES 
POTATO PLATES ARE ONE WARM YES THING BUT IT'S THE POTENTIAL OF 
THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT GETS ME 
EXCITED WHAT ABOUT SUPERCHARGED 
SPUDS IT CAN DO ZERO TO SIXTY IN UNDER FOUR 
SECONDS HAS A TOP SPEED IN EXCESS 
OF ONE FORTY M. P. H. AND THE TYRES ARE MADE 
FROM POTATOES IN FACT THE 
COMPONENTS OF THE CAR SOUND 
DELICIOUS A HANDFUL OF POTATOES 
SPRINKLING OF CASHEW NUTS AND 
DRIZZLE OF COOKING OIL BUT THE 
RACER HAS BETTER POWER TO WEIGHT 
RATIO THAN A FERRARI BEN WHY DID 
YOU BUILD THIS CAR IN THE FIRST 
PLACE 
BASICALLY MOTOR SPORT GETS A PLACE BAD PRESS ABOUT BEING BAD FOR THE 
ENVIRONMENT AND WE HAVE SET OUT TO 
PROVE YOU CAN MAKE IT QUITE GREEN 
AND ALSO TO PROVE THAT THINGS ARE 
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY DON'T HAVE 
TO BE SLOW AND BORING BUT COOL AND 
FAST 
THE TYRE YOU ARE SITTING ON FAST IS MADE FROM POTATO STARCH IT IS A 
POTATO TYRE 
THAT MEANS THEY HAVE 
LOW ROLLING RESISTANCE AND THEY USE 
LESS TWO LESS TWO LESS CO TWO WE 
ARE HOPING BY GROWING ALL THE 
DIFFERENT BITS FROM PLANTS YOU CAN 
ALMOST GROW A CAR FROM SEED WE ARE 
HOPING THAT MANUFACTURERS WILL GO 
EVEN FURTHER AND HAVE VERY VERY 
FRIENDLY MATERIALS IN THE 
MANUFACTURER OF CARS 
THE RACE IS 
ON TO FIND A SOLUTION THE ANSWER 
COULD BE AS CHEAP AS CHIPS SHE 
MENTIONED THERE ABOUT MAKING POTATO 
CLOCKS AT SCHOOL L. NEVER DID THAT 
DID YOU NO MISSED OUT L. STILL NO THINK IT IS INCREDIBLE WE ARE 
GOING TO REMIND YOU HOW TO DO IT 
WITH THE HELP OF HAR BEEP WE ARE 
ISOLATED HIM IN SPECIAL AREA IN 
CASE THINGS GO WRONG HARDEEP 
COMMENCE THE WIRING BUT PLEASE 
PLEASE BE CAREFUL WE LOVE YOU WE 
DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU THE BATTERY 
IS A TYPE OF ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL 
IT CONVERTS CHEMICAL ENERGY INTO 
ELECTRICAL ENERGY THERE IS A 
TRANSFER OF ELEC TRONS INTO THE 
COATING AND THE COPPER WIRE 
INSERTED INTO ANOTHER POTATO THE 
ELEC TRONS IN THE COPPER WIRE ARE 
FORCED MOVE GENERATING CURRENT 
IT'S NOT ENOUGH POWER TO SHOCK YOU 
BUT DO BE CAREFUL CAN IT POWER 
CAN IT POWER THIS DIGITAL CLOCK 
LET'S LOOK 
THE SUSPENSE IS UNBEARABLE 
FANTASTIC FANTASTIC STICK IT IN YOUR MEMOIRS YOU CAN'T 
HAVE DONE ANYTHING MORE IMPRESSIVE 
ALL HAIL THE THE POTATO ALL HAIL 
TERRY AND HARDEEP TOMORROW WE 
HAVE HAVE TOM CONTI THE MAN WHO 
WON SHIRLEY VALENTINE'S HEART AND 
HOW THE POTATO WON THE SECOND WORLD 
WAR YOU HEARD THAT CORRECTLY SEE 
YOU THEN
