SUCCESSFUL SINGER SONGWRITERS 
ANOTHER SUNNY DAY AFTER A DULL 
START IT WILL BE WARM BUT MORE 
MORE BREEZE THAN WE HAVE BEEN USE 
SO IT WILL FEEL COOLER THAN WE HAVE 
BEEN USED TO AS WELL 
THE DEATH TOLL IN THE CHINESE 
EITHER QUAKE HAS RISEN TO TEN THOUSAND 
THERE ARE FEARS IT WILL GO HIGHER 
IN ONE TOWN ALONE THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE ARE REPORTED TO BE STILL 
BURIED UNDER RUBBLE RESCUERS ARE 
STRUGGLING TO REACH REMOTE AREAS 
THE EPICENTRE WAS IN WENCHUAN 
THAT'S IN THE SICHUAN PROVINCE 
WHERE LOCAL ROADS ARE ARE BLOCKED 
AND CHUNEICATIONS DOWN 
AS RESCUERS TRY AND ACCESS THE 
WORSE HIT AREAS IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
COMPREHEND THE SIZE OF THE DISASTER 
THIS IS DESTRUCTION ON AN ENORMOUS 
SCALE RESCUERS MUST BATTLE 
MOUNTAINS OF RUBBLE TO SAVE EACH 
LIFE LIFE TWO SCHOOL COLLAPSES ARE THOUGHT TO 
HAVE TRAPPED UP TO TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN 
THIS BOY WAS ONE OF THE FEW TO HAVE 
SO FAR BEEN BROUGHT OUT ALIVE 
IN ANOTHER AREA STATE TELEVISION 
REPORTED THAT IN ONE FACTORY ALONE 
SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED OR TRAPPED IN THE WRECKAGE 
THE ARMY IS DEPLOYING FIFTY THOUSAND 
SOLDIERS TO HELP WITH THE RESCUE 
EFFORT EFFORT THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES ARE KEEN TO 
SHOW THEY ARE REACTING SWIFTLY THE 
CHINESE PREMIER FLEW INTO THE AREA 
HOURS AFTER THE QUAKE WE CAN'T 
HESITATE FOR ONE MINUTE HE SAID 
IN ONE MINUTE OR ONE SECOND YOU 
COULD LOSE A CHILD A SURVIVOR 
WITH PHONE AND POWER LINES DOWN 
THE STATE NEWS AGENCY SAYS 
OFFICIALS LOST CONTACT WITH FIFTEEN 
BRITISH TOURISTS IN THE AREA BUT 
THE FOREIGN OFFICE HAS BEEN UNABLE 
TO CONFIRM THE REPORT 
FEARING AFTERSHOCKS MANY ARE 
STAYING AWAY FROM BUILDINGS THIS 
IS CHINA'S WORST EITHER QUAKE SINCE 
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND HIT THE COUNTRY'S 
MOST POPULATED AREA 
THERE ARE STILL PLACES WHICH 
HAVEN'T BEEN REACHED WITH 
COMMUNICATION LINKS DOWN THERE IS 
NO REAL INDICATION OF JUST HOW BAD 
THINGS ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE REMAIN UNACCOUNTED FOR 
SEEING THE POWER OF THE EARTHQUAKE 
IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE 
DEATH TOLL IS EXPECTED TO CLIMB 
MUCH MUCH HIGHER 
LET'S GET THE LATEST FROM QUENTIN 
SOMMERVILLE WHO IS IN BEIJING 
QUENTIN GOOD MORNING THE CHINESE 
AUTHORITIES ARE TRYING TO GET AL 
GRIP ON HOW BAD THIS HAS BEEN BUT 
AT LEAST THERE HAS BEEN AL MAJOR RESPONSE RESPONSE ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY AND THEY WILL BE THANKFUL OF THAT 
MAJOR RESPONSE THIS DISASTER IS 
MOVING INTO A DIFFERENT ORDER OF 
MAGNITUDE WITHIN THE LAST HOUR WE 
HAVE HEARD FROM OFFICIALS IN ONE 
SINGLE CITY ALONE WHICH IS TO THE 
EAST OF THE EPICENTRE OF THE 
EARTHQUAKE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE 
BELIEVED TO BE BURIED UNDER THE 
RUBBLE AND STILL WE HAVEN'T GOT TO 
THE HEART OF THE SHOCK ITSELF TO 
THE EPICENTRE OF THE EARTHQUAKE 
THAT'S WENCHUAN COUNTY IT IS CUT 
CUT OFF AND THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO 
LIVE THERE REMAIN UNACCOUNTED FOR 
I'VE JUST HEARD IN THE LAST FEW 
MINUTES SOME CHINESE TROOPS MANAGE 
TODAY MAKE IT IN THERE BUT ONLY A 
TINY NUMBER THE ROADS ARE ARE 
BLOCKED HELICOPTERS HAVEN'T BEEN 
ABLE TO LAND THEY HAVE HAD TO COME 
BACK AND AS THE PRIME MINISTER SAID 
TREASURE EVERY SECOND BECAUSE EVERY 
SECOND COULD MEAN A CHILD'S LIFE 
DOES THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT FEEL IT 
CAN HANDLE THIS ON ITS OWN WITH 
CHINESE RESOURCES IS THERE ANY 
QUESTION OF THEM ASKING FOR OUTSIDE 
HELP 
ALREADY THE CHINESE AREN'T HELP JUST USING THEIR OWN RESOURCES 
THEY'VE ACCEPTED RELIEF SUPPLIES 
THEY DID THAT YESTERDAY FROM THE 
RED CROSS CHINA ISN'T SHY ABOUT 
ASKING FOR HELP WHEN IT NEEDS NEEDS 
IT WAS IN THE PAST BUT IN RECENT 
TIMES IT HASN'T BEEN ALSO THEY 
HAVE A HUGE STANDING ARMY A 
MASSIVE ARMY WELL TRAINED ARMY WHO 
HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED AND WERE 
DEPLOYED TO GET TO THE ZONE AND IT 
IS WORTH REMEMBERING THE OLYMPICS 
ARE THREE MONTHS AWAY CHINA PUT A 
LOT OF STARTING SPECIALLY TRAINING 
A WHOLE NEW BUNCH OF TROOPS WHO 
WERE ABLE TO DEAL WITH COLLAPSED 
BUILDINGS AND TRAINED SNIFFER DOGS 
THEY DIDN'T EXPECT THEY WOULD HAVE 
TO DEAL WITH A DISASTER ON THIS 
SCALE THOUGH 
THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF SCHOOL 
ASSESSMENT TESTS OR S. A. T.'S FOR 
CHILDREN ACROSS ENGLAND IS DAMAGING 
THEIR EDUCATION AND SHOULD BE 
SCRAPPED THAT'S ACCORDING TO M. P.'S 
THE SCHOOLS SELECT COMMITTEE WARNED 
THAT GOVERNMENT TARGETS WERE 
DISTORTING PRIORITIES AND IT SET 
OUT PLANS FOR RADICAL CHANGE 
BREAKFAST'S JULIA GEORGE IS WITH 
ONE FAMILY GOING THROUGH S. A. T.'S THIS 
WEEK WEEK HELLO JEWELS 
THIS IS THE REYNOLDS FAMILY AND 
THEY LIVE IN BRISTOL AND REECE IS 
ONE OF THOUSANDS OF ELEVEN AND FOURTEEN 
YEAR OLDS WHO ARE SITTING THEIR 
S. A. T.'S REECE HAD A COUPLE OF TESTS 
YESTERDAY INCLUDING SCIENCE WHICH 
HE LIKES AND HE HAS THREE MORE 
TODAY YESTERDAY WE TALKED ABOUT 
THE STRESSES AND THE PRESSURES THAT 
CHILDREN PARNLTS AND TEACHERS WERE 
BEING PUT UNDER WE ARE LOOKING AT 
WHAT THE SCHOOLS SELECT COMMITTEE 
ARE SAYING ABOUT THE TESTS IT IS 
NOT COMPLIMENTARY THEIR CONCERN IS 
THAT PUPILS BE BEING DRILLED TO 
PASS THE TESTS AT THE SCHOOL DO 
THEY CONCENTRATE ARE THE TESTS 
REALLY IMPORTANT 
YES THEY ARE THE 
MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WHOLE 
OF KEY STAGE TWO L. THINK I CAN GET 
OVER THIS WEEK 
YOU ARE NOT FINDING IT TOO 
STRESSFUL STRESSFUL EXCEPT LITERACY 
LITERACY IS A WOBBLE I'M SURE HE 
WILL DO WELL 
LET'S ASK MUM THIS CONCERN ABOUT 
THE FOCUS ON TESTING AND AND KIDS 
DON'T GET A ROUNDER EDUCATION WHAT 
DO YOU THINK 
THERE IS A LOT OF 
EMPHASIS ON PASSING THE S. A. T.'S AND I 
THINK SOMETIMES IT IS NOT POSSIBLE 
FOR THE TEACHERS TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE 
THE CHILDREN HOW THEY WOULD LIKE TO 
AND TO MAKE THE LESSONS AS 
INTERESTING AS THEY WOULD LIKE TO 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GET THEM 
THROUGH THE EXAMS 
YES THAT DOES SEEM TO BE THE 
CONCERN OF THIS REPORT THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THAT THE NUMBER 
OF TIMES CHILDREN ARE TEST ITED IS 
REDUCED THERE IS SUGGESTION 
THERE SHOULD BE MORE CONCENTRATION 
ON TEACHER ASSESSMENT THAT 
TEACHERS KNOW HOW KIDS ARE DOING 
AND THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING 
COMMUNICATING TO PARENTS PERHAPS 
THERE SHOULD BE MORE RANDOM TESTING 
PERHAPS INSPECTORS COULD GO INTO 
SCHOOLS AND TEST FEW CHILDREN 
RATHER THAN TESTING ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY 
THERE ARE MORE GLOOMY ECONOMIC 
FIGURES OUT THIS MORNING BOTH FROM 
THE HIGH STREET AND THE PROPERTY 
MARKET NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF SURVEYORS REPORTED

THE EXCLAMATION POINT AT THE END OF 
A GLORIOUS SENTENCE

THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY 
TELEGRAPH AND POSTSCRIPT ON 
CRASH LANDING OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN BOEING IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY 
ABNORMALLY COLD CONDITIONS OVER 
RUSSIA RUSSIA THE INDEPENDENT HAS PICTURE OF 
THE SEX AND THE CITY GOALS AGAIN 
THEY ARE SAYING THE HOUSING MARKET 
IS THE WORST FOR THIRTY YEARS 
CONFIDENCE HAS SUNK TO ITS LAIR 
LOWEST LEVEL 
THE SON FOCUSES ON THE STARVING IN 
OXFORD STREET YESTERDAY A BLOODY 
BLADE LITTERS ONE OF BRITAIN'S 
BUSIEST STREETS 
AND JIMMY MIZEN'S MOTHER ON THE 
FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MIRROR 
SAYING IF ANYBODY GETS TO HEAVEN 
IT WILL BE HIM 
IN THE SUN THE INCREDIBLE HE IS 
ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE THAT IS YOUR 
AVERAGE COW HE IS HEADING ON TO 
BEING AS BIG AS AN ELEPHANT THE 
PAPER SAYS HE WOULD MAKE OVER 
THIRTEEN THOUSAND BEEFBURGERS 
WHY IS HE SO BIG 
YOU WOULD ASK DIFFICULT QUESTIONS 
NEVER ASK FOR DETAILS IN THE INSIDE 
PAGE STORIES THIS IS A PICTURE 
FROM THE DAILY TELEGRAPH TODAY IT 
IS THE HOTTEST MAY SINCE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO THAT 
IS A PICTURE OF SOME GIRLS IN A 
FOUNTAIN IN LONDON IT IS 
SUGGESTING FOUR OUT OF FIVE FIRMS 
HAVE REPORTED STAFF HAVE CALLED IN 
ABSENT APPARENTLY LOTS OF PEOPLE 
CALLING IN SICK OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE 
SICK AND IT IS GENUINE BUT IT HAS 
BEEN VERY NICE OUT THERE 
HERE IS THE ANSWER WE DON'T KNOW 
WHAT HAS MADE HIM SO BIG AND ALSO 
HE WAS AN ORPHAN HE WAS DUMPED AT 
THE ANIMAL SANCTUARY IN SOMERSET 
YEARS AGO 
HERE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS NOT BEEN 
IN THE SUN AND WE ARE PLEASED TO 
HAVE HIM BACK DECLAN 
A AM READING ABOUT THIS COW IN THE 
DAILY MAIL ACCORDING TO THEIR 
REPORT HE IS NOT THE SIZE HE IS 
BECAUSE OF OVER EATING HE EATS 
VERY LITTLE THE PAPERS HAVE 
UNLOCKED ON THE STATE OF THE 
ECONOMY AND THESE FIGURES WE HAVE 
TODAY ON THE HOUSING MARKET THE 
HOUSING MARKET THESE ARE FIGURES 
FROM THE ROYAL INSTITUTION OF 
CHARTERED SURVEYORS NEARLY EVERY 
SURVEY IN THE COUNTRY SAYS HOUSE 
PRICES WERE LOWER IN THE MONTH OF 
APRIL BOTH HOUSE BUYERS AND 
SELLERS ARE ON STRIKE THE NUMBER 
OF INQUIRIES FROM POTENTIAL NEW 
BUYERS HAS FALLEN THAT IS THE SEVENTEENTH 
MONTH IN A ROW THAT NUMBER HAS GONE 
DOWN THERE ARE ALSO FEWER 
PROPERTIES ON THE MARKET AND THAT 
IS BECAUSE THE HOUSE SELLERS ARE 
THINKING I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET A 
BIT MORE FOR MY PROPERTY IF I WRITE 
THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM OUT SO THE 
NUMBER OF SALES IS DOWN A THIRD 
FROM A YEAR AGO SO THERE IS A 
STRIKE GOING ON AT BOTH ENDS OF THE 
HOUSING MARKET ON THE HIGH STREET 
DON'T GET TOO EXCITED FROM THE 
BRITISH RETAIL CONSORTIUM BECAUSE 
THE WEATHER IS AT A BIG FACTOR ON 
THIS IT IS WARM THIS APRIL AND WE 
HAD SNOW LAST APRIL UP BUT HIGHER 
PETROL BILLS HIGHER ENERGY COSTS 
HIGHER COUNCIL TAX AND ALSO HIGHER 
BORROWING COSTS MONEY IS TIGHT SO 
SHOPPERS ARE CONCENTRATING ON FOOD 
AND SPENDING LESS ON CLOTHING AND 
FOOTWEAR WE WILL FIND OUT TODAY 
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE HOLIDAY 
MARKET AND HOW MUCH WE ARE LIKELY 
TO SPEND ON HOLIDAYS ABROAD THIS 
YEAR THE BOSS OF EUROPE'S BIGGEST

THE CLOCK TRIED TO TAKE THE DAY OFF 
BECAUSE OF HOT WEATHER THIS IS BREAKFAST BREAKFAST THE DEATH TOLL FROM THE CHINESE 
EARTHQUAKE HAS RISEN TO MORE THAN 
TEN THOUSAND THE AUTHORITIES ARE WARNING 
THE FINAL FIGURE COULD BE HIGHER 
M. P.'S ARE CALLING FOR S. A. T.'S TO BE 
SCRAPPED BECAUSE THEY ARE DAMAGING 
CHILDREN'S EDUCATION 
IN COUPLE OF MINUTES ARE YOU 
TOO POOR TO PARENT WE WERE LOCKED 
AT THE RISING COST OF LIVING IS 
FORCING ONE IN THREE MUM'S BACK TO 
WORK 
WHEN IT COMES BACK TO LOOKING WORK AFTER CHILDREN THIS NURSERY WILL 
BE FILLING UP OVER THE NEXT FEW 
HOURS BUT WHAT ABOUT STAYING AT 
HOME AND LOOKING AT YOUR CHILDREN 
THAT HAS BECOME OF THE LUXURY FEWER 
AFFORD WE WILL BE FINDING OUT 
CAN AFFORD WE WILL BE FINDING OUT LATER LATER LOOKING A BIT WINDY IN THE BLUE 
PETER GARDEN 
THERE IS A BREEZE AND IF YOU ARE 
EXPOSED TO IT IT DOES FEEL COLD 
BUT IT IS BEAUTIFUL START TO THE 
DAY SUNSHINE IN LONDON AND IN 
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THE 
FORECAST IS A SUNNY ONE BUT ALSO 
BREEZY NOT EVERYONE IS ENJOYING 
SUNSHINE THERE IS CLOUD AROUND AND 
LOW CLOUD DOWN THE EAST COAST OF 
SCOTLAND AND PARTS OF THE EAST 
CODES COAST OF ENGLAND AND INTO 
THE MIDLANDS THAT WILL BURN BACK 
TO THE COAST IN SCOTLAND BY NINE A M. 
THE WEST IS BEST THE NORTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND IS SEEING SUNNY SKIES AS 
WELL BUT THE EAST IS PRONE TO THIS 
CLOUD INITIALLY AND THEN GOES INTO 
THE MIDLANDS BUT KENT AND THE 
SOUTH COAST IS A BRILLIANT START TO 
THE DAY BUT IT IS BREEZY INTO THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND VARIABLE 
AMOUNTS OF CLOUD HERE FOR WALES 
WE ARE LOOKING AT HIGH CLOUD AND 
SUNNY SKIES AND ALSO ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND IT IS WORTH 
MENTIONING THERE IS THE RISK OF 
JUST AN ISOLATED SHOWER IN THE 
NORTH WEST IF YOU CATCH ONE YOU 
WOULD BE VERY UNLUCKY ALTHOUGH THE 
CLOUD WILL BURN BACK TO THE EAST 
COAST FOR SOME PARTS PARTICULARLY 
THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND AND THE 
SOUTH EAST OF SCOTLAND THAT COULD 
HOLD THE BREEZE BACK THROUGH THIS 
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HARDLY 
CLOUD IN THE WEST OF THE COUNTRY 
BUT YOU CAN SEE THE CLOUDS PUSHING 
IN FROM THE NORTH SEA MAKING GOOD 
PROGRESS INTO EASTERN AND CENTRAL 
PARTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES NOT 
COLD NIGHT ALMOST A REPEAT 
PERFORMANCE IN THAT WE WILL SEE THE 
CLOUD MELT BACK TOWARDS THE COAST 
A FAIR BIT OF SUNSHINE AROUND 
TOMORROW LATER IN THE DAY WE WILL 
SEE SHOW WAS DEVELOPED IN THE 
SOUTH WEST HERALDING A CHANGE FOR 
THURSDAY 
THE RISING COST OF LIVING IS 
FORCING THOUSANDS OF NEW MOTHERS 
BACK TO WORK BECAUSE THEY CANNOT 
AFFORD TO STAY AT HOME AND PAID THE 
BILLS BILLS THAT IS ACCORDING TO NEW SURVEY 
WHICH FOUND ONE IN THREE PARENTS 
CHOOSING WORK TO STAYING AT HOME 
WITH THE BABIES TIM IS AT A 
NURSERY IN LONDON WITH MORE 
THE NURSERY WILL BE FILLING UP IN 
THE NEXT HOUR OR SO WITH CHILDREN 
BEING DROPPED OFF BY THEIR PARENTS 
MANY WHO WILL BE ON THEIR WAY TO 
WORK ARE THOSE PARENTS DOING THE 
RIGHT THING IN RETURNING TO THEIR 
JOBS HAVING HAD CHILDREN WHAT 
ABOUT STAYING AT HOME IT DOES SEEM 
THAT OPTION IS BECOMING LESS LIKELY 
BECAUSE THE SUMS DON'T ADD UP 
IN ONE WEEK ANGELA WILL FINISH HER 
MATERNITY LEAVE AND RETURN TO WORK 
SHE IS DREADING THE DAY SHE PARTS 
FROM JOSEPH BUT LIKE MANY SHE HAS 
LITTLE CHOICE 
I AM GOING TO MISS 
HIM I HAVE NO CHOSE I HAVE TO GO 
BACK WE HAVE BILLS TO PAY A 
MORTGAGE TO PAY FOR MY HUSBAND 
WORKS BUT I ALSO HAVE TO WORK TO 
KEEP REPAYMENTS ON OUR MORTGAGE AND 
FOOD SHOPPING EVERYTHING HAS GONE 
UP HE IS STARTING TO DEVELOP AND 
BECOMING HIS OWN CHARACTER HE IS 
STARTING TO WALK AND I WANTED TO BE 
AROUND TO SEE THOSE MILESTONES AND 
IT IS HEART WRENCHING 
THE NUMBER 
OF STAY AT HOME PARENTS IS AT ITS 
LOWEST LEVEL FOR FIFTEEN YEARS DOWN BY 
A FIFTH SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE ACCORDING TO THIS 
REPORT MORE THAN A THIRD OF 
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN UNDER TWO 
HAVE BOTH PARENTS IN WORK AND ONLY 
ONE IN TEN OF THOSE WORKING PARENTS 
ACTIVELY CHOSE TO RETURN THE 
MAJORITY SAID IN REALITY THERE WAS 
LITTLE ALTERNATIVE JOSEPH WILL BE 
IN GOOD HANDS ANGELA'S MUM WILL 
LOOK AFTER HIM BUT ANGELA COULD 
NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF RETURNING 
TO WORK FULL TIME SO SHE HAS 
DECIDED TO LET HER CAREER AND 
SALARY TAKE A HIT SO SHE CAN BE 
HOME ON MONDAYS 
I WENT BACK WITH 
THE REVIEW TO DEMOTE MYSELF L. JUST 
WANT TO BE A GRAPHIC DESIGNER AND 
THAT MEANS A PAY CUT AND LESS DAYS 
A WEEK BUT IT IS GOOD BECAUSE HE 
IS MY PRIORITY AT THE MOMENT 
ANGELA WILL SOON BE SPENDING HER 
FIRST DAYS AWAY FROM HER LITTLE BOY 
IT WILL BE EMOTIONAL BUT AS AN 
INCREASING NUMBER OF MUMS HAVE 
DISCOVERED PRETTY MUCH INEVITABLE 
THIS REPORT HAS BEEN PUT TOGETHER 
WITH USWITCH THE COMPARISON 
WEBSITE SEVEN PER CENT OF PARENTS STAY AT HOME 
TO LOOK AFTER THEIR CHILDREN WE 
CAN TALK TO LARA IS IT NOT VIABLE 
FOR PARENTS TO STAY AT HOME THE THE COST OF LIVING HAS GOT SO HIGH 
THESE DAYS THE SURVEY SHOWS BOTH 
PARENTS HAVE TO RETURN TO WORK IN 
SOME CASES SOON AFTER THEIR BABY IS 
BORN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OTHER 
CHOICE 
THERE ARE TAX CREDITS AND CHOICE CHILD VOUCHERS NOW IS THERE 
ENOUGH 
IT IS AVAILABLE FOR EVERY ENOUGH PARENT IT IS TRUE BUT THE PROBLEM 
IS FOR MANY PARENTS GET ISN'T 
ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DROP ONE WAGE 
SO BOTH PARENTS HAVE TO GO TO WORK 
HOW VALUABLE IS THAT TIME AT HOME 
WITH CHILDREN 
ASK ANY PARENT IT 
IS VALUABLE EVERY PARENT WANTS THE 
PERFECT WORK LIFE BALANCE AND THE 
GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO LOOK INTO IT 
MORE TO HELP THEM ACHIEVE THAT AND 
MAKE LIFE LESS STRESSFUL AND CHILD 
CARE MORE FOR DOUBLE SO THEY CAN 
HAVE MORE TIME AT HOME WITH THEIR 
CHILDREN AND ALSO BE ABLE TO WORK 
SOME PEOPLE THINK AND NURSERY IS 
VERY GOOD FOR CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY 
MEET OTHER CHILDREN AND THERE IS 
THAT STIMULUS 
YES THEY LEARN 
SOCIAL SKILLS FROM A YOUNG AGE AND 
IT TEACHES THEM GREAT SKILLS FOR 
THE FUTURE AS WELL 
IT IS A 
CONTENTIOUS ISSUE AND MOST PEOPLE 
WOULD SAY NURSERIES ARE BETTER BUT 
MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT DESPITE THE 
FACT THEY WANT TO STAY AT HOME 
THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT 
STILL TO COME THIS MORNING AS 
SCHOOLCHILDREN ACROSS ENGLAND SIP 
THEIR NATIONAL TESTS M. P.'S ARE 
GIVING THE EXAMS AND F. FOR FAILURE 
CALLING FOR THEM TO BE SCRAPPED 
JULIA CAN TELL US MORE 
THEY WERE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE 
STANDARDS IN SCHOOLS BUT NOW THOSE 
M. P.'S ARE SAYING THE TESTS COULD BE 
DAMAGING YOUR CHILD'S EDUCATION WE 
WILL BE TALKING TO RESET BECAUSE HE 
IS IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS MUQTADA AL 
SADR AND HIS PARENTS

WOW WOW THE DAILY MAIL THEY HAVE A PICTURE 
OF OF SARAH JESSICA PARKER IT WAS 
THE PREMIERE LAST NIGHT AND EVERY 
WORKING FAMILY COULD FACE PAYING AN 
AGEING TAX TO PROVIDE CARE FOR THE 
ELDERLY THAT'S ACCORDING TO GORDON 
BROWN PLANS TEAKING THE FORM OF A 
COMPULSORY LEVY TO FORCE THEM TO 
COVER THE COST OF CARE HOME PLACES 
IN THE LAST STAGES OF THEIR LIVES 
CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSAL 
THESE LADIES ARE ON THE FRONT OF 
EVERY PAPER 
SARAH JESSICA PARKER IS THE ONLY 
ONE WEARING A HAT 
THE INDEPENDENT IS LEADING ON THE 
SURVEY ABOUT HOUSING 
CONFIDENCE IN BRITAIN'S HOUSING 
MARKET SUNK TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL FOR 
THIRTY YEARS 
AND DECLAN HAS BEEN TELLING US 
ABOUT IT 
MORE SEX AND THE CITY ON THE FRONT 
OF THE SUN 
WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE PREMIERE 
LATER WE HAVE BEEN TO SEE THE FILM 
ME AND BILL WE ARE TALKING TO KIM 
CATRELL KNIFE YOBS MAY ESCAPE WITH 
FINESMENT HORRIFIED SHOPPERS SAW A 
MAN STABBED TO DEATH IN BRITAIN'S 
BUSIEST STREET IT WAS IN LONDON'S 
OXFORD STREET 
TIMES SAYS THE ELITE SQUADS TAKEN 
ON TO PROSECUTE THE BARONS OF FRAUD 
HAS GONE BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD 
THE AGENCY IS CASTING ITS NETS 
WIDER AFTER TWO WASTED YEARS 
IT HAS BEEN MANY PEOPLE'S WORST 
NIGHTMARE AFTER THEY SAW THE FILM 
JAWS JAWS BUT FOR JASON CULL THAT FEAR BECAME 
A REALITY BECAUSE HE WAS ATTACKED 
BY A GREAT WHITE SHARK HE WAS 
SWIMMING OFF THE COAST OF SOUTH 
WEST AUSTRALIA HE FOUGHT BACK AND 
LIVED TO TELL THE HEAR AND YOU CAN 
HEAR HIS STORY NOW BECAUSE WE ARE 
GOING TO SPEAK TO HIM FROM HIS 
HOSPITAL BED IN ALBANY 
HOW ARE YOU DOING THERE 
I'M DOING WELL ALL THINGS 
CONSIDERED THANK YOU 
BUT YOU ARE IN YOUR HOSPITAL BED 
BECAUSE DID IT HOW MUCH OF 
CHUNK DID THE SHARK TAKE OUT OF 
YOU 
HE TOOK A DESCENT SIZE OUT OF YOU MY LEFT CALF HE DID QUITE A BIT OF 
DAMAGE TO MY LEFT LOWER LEG 
HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN MORE HAD YOU 
NOT DECIDE TODAY HIT BACK WHAT DID 
YOU DO 
I JUST DIVED INTO THE WATER 
AND I HAD DONE A LAP OF THE 
SWIMMING CIRCUIT EIGHTY METERS OFF THE 
BEACH AND HE WAS TREADING WATER 
DECIDING WHETHER TO DO ANOTHER AND 
I SAW A SHAPE COME COME TOWARDS ME 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A DOLPHIN BUT IT 
TUMPED R. TURNED OUT TO BE A A SHARK 
WHEN I REALISED WHAT IT WAS I 
PUNCHED HIM 
HE START TODAY DRAG ME OUT TO SEE 
I I TRIED TO TO FEEL TO FEEL FOR 
HIS FINS BUT I STABBED HIM IN THE 
EYE EYE MY SON IS INTERESTED IN REPTILES 
AND MARINE CREATURES AND I VIEWED A 
DOCUMENTARY WHERE HE HAD THAT A 
SURFER HAD BEEN DRAGGED UNDERWATER 
AND HE HE PUNCHED THE SHARK IN THE 
GILS AND HE SPAT HIM OUT 
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY OTHER ATTACKS 
LIKE THAT AROUND THERE 
NO NO I 
DON'T THINK THERE HAS BEEN MANY 
ATTACKS FOR DECADESMENT THERE WERE 
DOLPHINS IN THE AREA 
SOME ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THAT 
SHARKS AREN'T NATURALLY AGGRESSIVE 
IN THAT SENSE I SUPPOSE IT MAY 
HAVE BEEN CHECKING YOU OUT AS A 
FOOD SOURCE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WELL HE MAY HAVE BEEN BUT WHEN HE 
CAME UP AND BUMPED INTO ME AND PUT 
HIS MOUTH AROUND MY LEG I FIGURED 
THAT HE WAS EXPRESSING PRETTY MUCH 
OF AN INTEREST 
I THINK YOUR REACTION WAS THE RIGHT 
ONE ONE HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO BE IN 
HOSPITAL FOR 
I'M NOT SURE AT THIS STAGE AT 
LEAST A FEW MORE MORE WEEKS 
WE WILL WISH YOU THE BEST JASON AND 
CONGRATULATIONS ON DOING SO WELL 
POKING SHARK IN THE EYE IS NO 
EASY THING YOU DID THE RIGHT THING 
JASON CULL IN AUSTRALIA THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH 
THE WAY HE SAID THAT HIS SON 
WATCHES THE DOCUMENTARY AND KNOWS 
TO PUNCH A SHARK IN THE GILS 
GO FOR THE GILS 
IF YOU ARE EVER IN THAT SITUATION 
IT IS WORTH KNOWING 
IS IT WORTH MORE THAN POKE IN THE 
EYE WITH A SHARP STICK 
IT IS WE ARE GOING TO SEE SUNSHINE 
AROUND AND IT IS BREEZY IF YOU 
ARE STANDING OUTSIDE EXPOSED TO THE 
BREEZE DESPITE THE SUNSHINE IT

CLOUD FIRST THING ESPECIALLY THE 
EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND PARTS OF 
THE EAST OF ENGLAND AS AS FAR IN

BE UNLUCKY IF YOU GET ONE FROM THE 
WASH WE WILL SEE MORE CLOUD LAP ON 
THE SHORE FROM THE NORTH SEA THE

TONIGHT YOU CAN SEE HOW THE CLOUD 
ENCROUCHES FROM THE NORTH SEA 
MAKING PROGRESS ACROSS SCOTLAND TO 
THE WEST WE HAVE GOT THE CLEARER 
SKIES TOMORROW IT IS THE WEST 
THAT WILL START OFF AGAIN WITH THE 
SUNNY SKIES AND TOMORROW LIKE TODAY

OFFICER SUFFERED SERIOUS LEG 
INJURIES INJURIES I WOULD HOPE AND TRUST THAT THE 
OFFICER CAN RECOVER FROM THESE 
INJURIES THEY HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED 
AS NOT LIFE THREATENING BUT WE 
KNOW FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS 
OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY THAT ALTHOUGH 
THE INJURIES MAY NOT BE LIFE 
THREATENING THEY CAN BE VERY 
SERIOUS SERIOUS DETECTIVES ARE ONLY BEGINNING THEIR 
INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATION BUT AT THIS STAGE IT IS BELIEVED 
THAT DISSIDENT REPUBLICANS WERE 
RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBLE SIX MONTHS AGO THEY INJURED TWO 
OTHER POLICE OFFICERS IN SEPARATE 
SHOOTINGS IN DUNGANNON AND 
LONDONDERRY LONDONDERRY EARLIER THIS YEAR WARNING THAT 
DISSIDENT GROUPS WERE BECOMING MORE

FOR THE REYNOLDS FAMILY IN BRISTOL 
REECE IS IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS S. A. T.'S 
YESTERDAY HE DID TWO YESTERDAY HE 
DID MATHS YESTERDAY AND TODAY IT 
IS THE DREADED LITERACY YOU'RE 
WORRIED ABOUT LITERACY 
YEAH I'M 
WORRIED ABOUT LITERACY THAT'S ONE 
OF MY HARDEST SUBJECTS BUT I'M NOT 
TOO WORRIED L. HAVE GOT A GOOD IDEA 
OF WHAT I'M GOING TO DO 
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME 
YESTERDAY WE WERE TALK BEING THE 
PRESSURES BUT WE COULDN'T 
CONCENTRATE ON THAT THIS MUCH HOW 
MUCH OF THE YEAR HAVE YOU SPENT 
PREPARING FOR THE TESTS 
WELL IT

BIT OF WORK WE DO A REWARD BUT 
SOMETIMES IN P. E. SESSIONS SOME 
CHILDREN WILL BE TAKEN OUT TO DO 
BOOSTER SESSIONS WHICH THEY MISS 
OUT ON THEIR P. E. 
I BET THEY DON'T LIKE THAT MUCH NO NO BUT THEY MIGHT GET P. E. AFTER BUT IT 
DEPENDS DEPENDS LET'S BRING IN MUM AND DAD 
THE REPORT REPORT OUT TODAY THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS SELECT COMMITTEE 
REPORT IS SAYING THERE IS CONCERN 
HERE THAT PUPILS ARE DRILLED TO 
PASS TESTS AND IT IS DISTORTING 
THEIR EDUCATION WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THE WAY TESTS ARE RUN IN SCHOOLS 
I I THINK THERE IS TOO MUCH TESTING 
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD OF HAD 
S. A. T.'S ESPECIALLY FOR SEVEN YEAR OLDS 
I AM NOT KEEN ON ELEVEN YEAR OLDS 
DOING IT IT RESTRICTS EDUCATION TO 
A DEGREE TEACHERS HAVE GONE INTO 
TEACHING FOR VOCATION AND THEY 
ARE ABLE TO DELIVER INFORMATION AND 
IN AN AN ENGAGING WAY BECAUSE 
THERE IS PRESSURE FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT IT TRANSFERS INTO THE 
SCHOOL SOMETIMES AND THEY ARE NOT 
ABLE TO TEACH HOW THEY WOULD LIKE 
TO TO DO YOU GET THE IMPRESSION THAT 
REECE HAS BEEN CONCENTRATING TOO 
MUCH ON THE TESTS OR DO YOU FEEL 
THEY ARE IMPORTANT SO YOU KNOW HOW 
THE SCHOOL IS PERFORMING THERE THERE WILL ABDEGREE OF TESTING TO 
UNDERSTAND HOW WELL HE IS GETTING 
ON BUT HE HAS BEEN CONCENTRATING 
ON THE TEST AND STUDYING FOR THE 
TEST SINCE HE START INDEED 
SEPTEMBER AND HE IS A BIT OVER THE 
TOP IN THAT THAT RESPECT YES 
REECE HAS MORE TESTS THIS MORNING 
BUT HE IS LOOKING CONFIDENT WE 
THINK THE EARLY START WON'T DO HIM 
ANY HARM 
XWHE WANT A RE COMMITTEE THE WANT 
THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF 
TIMES THAT PUPILS ARE SUGGESTED 
THEY ARE SUGGESTING RANDOM TESTS 
JUST A FEW CHILDREN WOULD BE TESTED 
AND THAT GIVE PEOPLE AN IDEA OF 
WHERE NATIONAL STANDARDS ARE 
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THIS MORNING 
ABOLISHED TESTS FOR PUPILS AT ELEVEN 
AND FOURTEEN THE COMMONS SELECT 
COMMITTEE SAYS TEACHING TO THE TEST 
IS NOW ENDEMIC AS CHILDREN ARE 
DRILLED TO PASS EXAMS TO INFLATE 
SCHOOL'S POSITION IN THE LEAGUE 
TABLES TABLES THE DAILY MAIL CHOOSERS TO LEAD 
WITH FAMILIES PAYING AN AGEING TAX 
TO PROVIDE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY

COMPULSORY LEVY TO FORCE THEM TO

ALSO SARAH JESSICA PARKER AND THE 
SEX AND THE CITY PREMIER LAST NIGHT

THE DAILY EXPRESS FUEL PRICES OF 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN JUMP IN HOUSEHOLD ENERGY BILLS

TO LET KNIFE YOBS OFF WITH A SLAP 
ON THE WRIST 
THOSE OF THE FRONT PAGES THIS 
MORNING MORNING STILL TO COME ON THE PROGRAMME 
TODAY TODAY ARE YOU TOO POOR TO PARENT WE LOOK 
AT HOW THE RISING COST OF LIVING IS 
FORCING ONE IN THREE NEW MUMS BACK 
TO WORK 
IT IS BREAKFAST TIME AT THIS 
NURSERY IN SOUTH WEST LONDON IT 
HAS A VERY POPULAR PLACE BECAUSE A 
LOT OF PARENTS HAVE DROPPED THEIR 
KIDS OFF AND GONE TO WORK WHAT 
ABOUT STAYING AT HOME THAT IS A 
LUXURY FEWER AND FEWER CAN AFFORD 
MORE DETAILS IN A MOMENT 
MUSEUM MACRO I AM A BELIEVER 
FIND OUT WHEN FIND OUT WHAT 
HAPPENED WHEN WE CAUGHT UP WITH 
NEIL DIAMOND 
DID YOU KNOW HE WROTE RED RED 
WINE WINE I DID NOT KNOW BUT I DO NOW TIME 
FOR A LOOK AT THE WEATHER HE KNEW 
OF VERY LARGE 
YOU ARE VERY LARGE 
IS CHILLY START TO THE DAY 
BECAUSE WE HAVE A STIFF BREEZE 
COMING IN THE LOW CLOUD AND THE 
EAST WILL BURN AWAY AND FOR MANY IT 
IS GOING TO BE SUNNY AND BREEZY 
THE FORECAST FOR THE REST OF THE 
DAY IS WARM IF YOU ARE EXPOSED TO 
THE BREEZE IT WILL TAKE THE EDGE OF 
THE TEMPERATURES THE TEMPERATURES 
ARE STILL ABOVE AVERAGE FOR MANY 
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THE CLOUD IS 
GOING BACK TWELVE HOURS TO MORE OR LESS 
THE CURRENT STAGE THERE IS CLOUD 
DOWN THE EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND AND 
PARTS OF THE EAST COAST OF ENGLAND 
IN AS FAR AS THE MIDLANDS IN THE 
DAY WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE 
SUNSHINE FURTHER EAST THERE IS 
THAT CLOUD FOR EAST ANGLIA THIS 
MORNING FINE DATE A NOTICEABLE 
BREEZE THE SAME TOWARDS THE ISLE 
OF WIGHT BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINE TO 
ENJOY AS WE SWOOPED INTO THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND HIGH CLOUD 
SO HAZY SUNSHINE THE BREEZE IS NOT 
AS STIFF FOR WALES A SIMILAR 
STORY SUNSHINE AROUND AND HIGH 
CLOUD AS WELL A GOOD START TO THE 
DAY FOR NORTHERN IRELAND THE NORTH 
WEST TODAY COULD SEE THE ODD 
I. SOLATED SHOWER AS COULD WALES AND 
PART OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND YOU 
WILL BE VERY UNLUCKY IF YOU CATCH 
ONE THE CLOUD WILL BURN BACK 
TOWARDS THE COAST LATER WE WILL 
SEE MORE CLOUD IN AROUND THE WASH 
AND PART OF EAST ANGLIA AND THAT IS 
WHERE THE TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
LOWER THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
OVERNIGHT YOU CAN SEE HOW THE CLOUD 
ENCROACHES FROM THE NORTH SEA 
ACROSS SCOTLAND IN TOWARDS THE 
MIDLANDS AS WELL BEST OF THE 
BRAKES WILL BE IN THE WEST AND THAT 
IS WHERE WE WILL HAVE THE LOVELY 
SUNSHINE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING 
LIKE TODAY THE CLOUD IN CENTRAL 
AND EASTERN AREAS WILL SLOWLY BURN 
BACK TOWARDS THE COAST AGAIN 
PEGGING BACK THE TEMPERATURES 
THESE TEMPERATURES ALONG THE COAST 
ARE MORE INDICATIVE OF WHAT WE CAN 
EXPECT THIS TIME OF YEAR TWENTY THREE HIS SEVENTY THREE 
IN FAHRENHEIT LATER THERE WILL BE 
SHOWERS IN THE SOUTH WEST AND THAT 
WILL HERALD BIT OF CHANGE 
I LIKE IT WHEN YOU WERE BIG 
SHE IS LARGER THAN LIFE CHARACTER 
COMMUTERS IN NOTTINGHAM COULD SOON 
BE THE FIRST IN THE U. K. TO BE TAXED 
FOR PARKING AT WORK 
THE COUNCIL HAVE VOTED TO INTRODUCE 
AN ANNUAL FEE FOR PARKING SPACES AT 
THE OFFICE TO TRY TO DRIVE PEOPLE 
ON TO PUBLIC TRANSPORT ANTHONY 
BARTON JOINED US FROM NOTTINGHAM 
HOW IS IT GOING TO WORK 
THAT ANNUAL FEE WILL STACK UP TO 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE A SPACE PER YEAR FOR PEOPLE 
IN NOTTINGHAM IF THE COUNCIL'S 
PLANS ARE APPROVED THAT WORKS OUT 
AT JUST UNDER FIVE A WEEK AND FOR 
COMPANY THE SIZE OF BOOTS ONE OF 
THE BIGGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE CITY 
THAT COULD MEAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR HE 
WON'T BE SURPRISED TO LEARN IT HAS 
COME AS SHOCK TO BUSINESSES AND 
COMMUTERS ALIKE IN THE CITY THEY 
ARE NOT PLEASED AT THE PROSPECT OF 
HAVING TO PAY THAT AMOUNT 
IT IS TO RAISE MONEY PEOPLE WILL 
STILL USE CARS THEY WILL PAY THEIR 
MONEY AND THEY WON'T TAKE PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT 
IT WON'T BE A LARGE TRANSPORT ENOUGH AMOUNT TO MAKE AL DIFFERENCE 
BUT I WON'T SEE MUCH BENEFIT I I WOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY AT PAYING SEVENTY FIVE P. 
I 
WILL HAVE TO GRIN AND BEAR IT I I WILL HAVE TO PAY IT I WON'T BE 
HAPPY PAYING IT AND THEN THEY ARE 
TALKING ABOUT PUTTING UP TO ONE POINT FIVE OH A 
DAY IT IS EXTORTIONATE IT ALREADY 
COST ME FIFTY A WEEK TO TRAVEL 
IT IS 
BEING DESCRIBED ALREADY BUY 
BUSINESSES HERE IN THE CITY AS AN 
UNFRIENDLY TAX FOR BUSINESSES 
LET'S BRING IN GEORGE CROWTHER FROM 
THE DERBYSHIRE AND NOTTINGHAMSHIRE 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SOME WOULD SEE 
THIS AS A BRAVE DECISION FROM THE 
CITY TO TACKLE CONGESTION WHICH IS 
SOMETHING IT CANNOT IGNORE 
CONGESTION IN THE CITY IS A PROBLEM 
AND DOES NEED TO BE TACKLED THIS 
IS THE WRONG WAY OF GOING ABOUT IT 
THIS TAX ON BUSINESS AND EMPLOYEES 
IN BUSINESS IS GOING TO DO VERY 
LITTLE TO HELP CONGESTION 
THE CITY 
HAS A REASONABLE TRACK RECORD WITH 
SOME FAIRLY INNOVATIVE IDEAS TO 
TACKLE CONGESTION NOT LEAST THE 
TRAMS IS THIS SOMETHING YOUR 
MEMBERS ARE WILLING TO AT LEAST 
TRUST THE CITY TO GO AND DEVELOP 
SOME SORT OF FEASIBILITY STUDY ON 
I THINK NOTTINGHAM HAS HAD GREAT 
DEAL OF FORESIGHT IN TERMS OF WHAT 
IT HAS DONE TO ITS TRANSPORT 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT IS 
SUPPORTED THE ISSUE IS HOW IS IT 
PAID FOR AT THE MOMENT THE CITY 
COUNCIL ARE COMING FORWARD WITH 
JUST ONE IDEA WHICH IS BASICALLY TO 
RAISE THIS TAX ON LARGER BUSINESSES 
WITHIN THE CITY THAT IS NOT IN THE 
BEST INTEREST OF NOTTINGHAM IN THE 
LONGER TERM 
THANKS VERY MUCH BUSINESSES NOT 
HAPPY WITH THIS THERE IS ALREADY 
TALK OF A LEGAL CHALLENGE AGAINST 
THE DECISION TO GO AHEAD WITH THEIR 
PLANS THEY HAVE TO GET GOVERNMENT 
APPROVAL FOR THIS TO GO ANY FURTHER 
AS WELL 
EVERY DAY IN THE PAPERS IT SEEMS WE 
ARE LEARNING ABOUT THE NEW PRICES 
GOING UP AND THE COST OF LIVING 
AND THAT IS FORCING THOUSANDS OF 
NEW MUMS TO GO BACK TO WORK 
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO STAY 
AT HOME 
THAT IS ACCORDING TO NEW SURVEY 
WHICH SUGGESTS ONE IN THREE NEW 
PARENTS ARE CHOOSING WORK OVER 
STAYING AT HOME WITH THEIR BABIES 
TIM MOCK THE JOINS US FROM 
NURSERY IN SOUTH WEST LONDON WHERE 
THEY ARE HAVING THEIR BREAKFAST 
IT IS ALL DELICIOUS THEY ARE 
HAVING FUN THE PARENTS OF CHILDREN 
AT THIS NURSERY HAVE DROPPED THEM 
OFF AND THEY ARE ON THEIR WAY TO 
WORK ARE THEY DOING THE RIGHT 
THING WHAT ABOUT STAYING AT HOME 
AND LOOKING AFTER THEIR KIDS IT 
SEEMS THAT CHOICE IS BECOMING 
HARDER AND HARDER AND LUXURY MANY 
OF THEM CANNOT AFFORD 
IN ONE WEEK ANGELA WILL FINISH HER 
MATERNITY LEAVE AND RETURN TO WORK 
SHE IS DREADING THE DAY SHE PARTS 
FROM ELEVEN MONTH OLD JOSEPH BUT LIKE 
MANY SHE HAS LITTLE CHOICE 
I AM 
GOING TO MISS HIM BUT I HAVE TO GO 
BACK L. HAVE TO GO BACK WE HAVE 
BILLS AND A MORTGAGE TO PAY MY 
HUSBAND WORKS BUT I ALSO HAVE TO 
WORK TO KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON OUR 
MORTGAGE AND PAY BILLS AND FOOD 
SHOPPING EVERYTHING HAS GONE UP 
LATELY HE IS STARTING TO DEVELOP 
AND BECOMING HIS OWN CHARACTER HE 
IS LEARNING TO WALK AND I WANTED TO 
BE AROUND TO SEE THOSE MILESTONES 
BUT I AM NOT SO IT IS HEART 
WRENCHING 
THE NUMBER OF STAY AT WRENCHING HOME PARENTS IS AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL 
FOR FIFTEEN YEARS DOWN BY A FIFTH SINCE 
NINETEEN NINETY THREE ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT 
MORE THAN A THIRD OF FAMILIES WITH 
CHILDREN UNDER TWO HAVE BOTH 
PARENTS IN WORK AND ARE ONLY AROUND 
ONE IN TEN OF THOSE WORKING PARENTS 
ACTIVELY CHOSE TO RETURN THE 
MAJORITY SAID IN REALITY THERE WAS 
LITTLE ALTERNATIVE JOSEPH WILL BE 
IN GOOD HANDS AND A.'S MUM ONE LOOK 
AT HIM EVEN STILL SHE COULD NOT 
BEAR THE THOUGHT OF RETURNING TO 
WORK FULL TIME SO SHE HAS DECIDED 
TO LET HER CAREER AND SALARY TAKE A 
HIT SO SHE CAN BE AT HOME ON 
MONDAYS 
I WENT BACK WITH A VIEW TO MONDAYS DEMON MYSELF AND I DID NOT WANT TO 
BE AN ART DIRECTOR ANY MORE JUST A 
GRAPHIC DESIGNER DEMOTE MYSELF IT 
IS A PAY CUT AND REST DAYS A WEEK 
ANGELA WILL SOON BE SPENDING HER 
FIRST DAYS AWAY FROM HER LITTLE BOY 
IT WILL BE EMOTIONAL BUT AS AN 
INCREASING NUMBER OF MUMS HAVE 
DISCOVERED PRETTY INEVITABLE 
THE REPORT HAS BEEN PUT TOGETHER BY 
USWITCH AND THEY SAY SEVEN PER CENT OF PARENTS 
SPEND TIME AT HOME WITH THEIR 
CHILDREN ROSIE YOU ARE A MUM HOW 
DID HE FEEL WHEN YOU RETURN TO 
WORK

CHILDREN ESPECIALLY AS THEY ARE 
GROWING UP BUT WE NEED THE SECOND 
INCOME AS IT WOULD BE A STRUGGLE 
WITHOUT IT BUT I ALSO LIKE TO WORK 
AS WELL 
DO YOU FEEL GUILTY ABOUT 
NOT BEING AT HOME WITH THEM MORE

HAVE THE TIME WITH THEM WHEN THEY 
ARE GROWING UP IT IS A SPECIAL 
TIME AND IT WILL BE OVER BEFORE I 
KNOW IT L. DO FEEL GUILTY BUT I 
DON'T HAVE CHOICE 
IT IS A 
CONTENTIOUS ISSUE MANY PEOPLE 
THINK NURSERIES ARE GREAT PLACES 
FOR KIDS TO SPEND TIME BUT CHOICE

LUXURY MANY PARENTS CANNOT AFFORD

HE HAS THE OLD DRIBBLING SKILLS 
PROBABLY NOT THE SAME PACE AS HE 
USED TO HAVE IN THE EIGHTIES 
HE STILL REMEMBERS HOW TO DIVE HE 
MANAGE TODAY SCORE AGAINST GOOD GOALKEEPER GOALKEEPER SIX TO SIX THE FINAL SCORE 
THEY ARE JUST RUNNING AROUND HIM 
THEY ARE NOT TRYING AT ALL 
NO BUT IT IS GOOD TO SEE DIEGO 
MARADONA LOOK BETTER BECAUSE HE HAD 
PUT ON WEIGHT 
LOOK AT THIS BOTTOM CONTROL AGAIN 
BILL BILL BILL PRACTISE THIS IN THE BACK 
GARDEN WITH THE KIDS 
HIS HANDS WERE NOWHERE NEAR THE 
BALL BALL IT IS FOR SOLVE SECRETARIES OUT 
FOR GOLF SECRETARIES OUT THERE 
WHAT DO YOU FIND YOUR BALL TRAPPED 
BEHIND AN OBJECT BUT NO ORDINARY 
OBJECT HAD IS LOCK LOCH LOMOND AND 
THE SPEEDBOAT LOST CONTROL AND 
ENDED UP IN BUNKER WANT A 
RULING WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU FIND 
YOUR BALL UNDERNEATH THE SPEEDBOAT 
I HAVE NO IDEA 
SOMEBODY WILL TELL US 
HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHO TO VOTE FOR 
POLICIES MAYBE PARTY LINES OR DO 
YOU PICK THE BEST LOOKING CANDIDATE 
AND THE ONE WITH THE MOST STYLISH 
WIFE WIFE THAT'S WHAT NEW MAGAZINE POLL 
WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE 
IN MOMENT WE WILL LOOK AT THE 
FININGS OF THE SURVEY FINDINGS OF 
THE SURVEY LET'S LOOK AT THE THREE 
MAIN PARTY LEADERS TRYING TO LOOK 
FABULOUS 
BECAUSE YOU'RE GORGEOUS I'D DO 
ANYTHING FOR YOU 
BECAUSE YOU'RE GORGEOUS I KNOW 
YOU'LL GET ME THROUGH 
BECAUSE YOU'RE GORGEOUS I'D DO 
ANYTHING FOR YOU 
BECAUSE YOU'RE GORGEOUS I KNOW 
YOU'LL GET ME THROUGH QUENTIN QUENTIN LETTS AND JENNIFER ASTON IS AN 
IMAGE CONSULTANT 
HAS IT REALLY COME TO THIS 
QUENTIN 
I DON'T THINK IT IS 
AS BAD QUENTIN AS THIS WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS 
MAGAZINE BRAIN DEAD MAGAZINE OR 
SOMETHING SOMETHING NO GRAT SEEIA MAGAZINE 
M. GEORGE 
CLOONEY STOOD AS A NAZI CANDIDATE 
HE WOULD BE ELECTED L. DON'T 
BELIEVE THAT BUT IMAGE IS 
IMPORTANT BUT I'M NOT SURE IT IS 
EVERYTHING EVERYTHING JENNIFER IS IT EVERYTHING HOW 
IMPORTANT IS IT IT USED TO BE 
POLITICIAN YOU WOULD VOTE FOR HIM 
BECAUSE YOU KNEW HE WOULD GET ON 
WITH THE JOB 
TONY BLAIR CHANGE 
THAT HAD IF WE LOOK AT OUR 
POLITICAL LEADERS WE FIND MEN WHO 
ARE MORE ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE A PERSONALITY THAT WE FEEL WE 
CAN RELATE TO AND THERE IS A IT 
ISN'T EVERYTHING BUT IT IS ABOUT 
IMAGE ISN'T A CYNICAL SUPERFICIAL 
COVERING OF SOMEBODY IT IS A WAY 
OF COMMUNICATING YOUR MESSAGE TO 
PEOPLE THAT YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE 
WITH SO IT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF 
THE MESSAGE IN THIS VERY MEDIA 
DRIVEN AGE 
HERE IS WHAT THE WOMEN ARE LOOKING 
FOR FOR JUST SO I KNOW JUST IN CASE 
THEY WANT THE SAME THINGS WOMEN 
APPARENTLY IN THE SURVEY THEY ROOK 
FOR IN A PARTNER THEY WANT HIM TO 
HAVE STRONG MORAL CODE MODERN 
IMAGE AND SOCIAL CONSCIENCE AND BE 
EMOTIONALLY SENSITIVE 
WELL THAT'S 
ME BUT A STRONG MORAL CODE DO 
THEY MEAN SOMEBODY WHO DECLARES WAR 
ON A FOREIGN COUNTRY FOR NO GOOD 
GOOD REASON JUST TO SUCK UP TO THE 
AMERICANS WE CAN GET INTO DEEP 
WATERS POLITICIANS HAVE ALWAYS 
BEEN PRANCING HER BERTS 
TAKE ANTHONY EDEN THAT BLOKE WAS A 
MALE MODEL AND HE DIDN'T TURN OUT 
TO BE PRIME MINISTER IT ALL 
HAPPENED BEFORE TONY BLAIR BUT YOU 
HAVE TO HAVE IMAGE MARRYING UP TO 
POLICY AND IT IS NO GOOD BEING 
FANTASTICALLY GOOD LOOKING AND 
MAYBE WE THINK OF ROBERT KILROY 
SILK AND NOT HAVING THE THE 
POLICIES TO MATCH THAT OR TO BRING 
IN THE VOTER 
DO YOU NOT THINK THAT SOME VOTERS 
WILL THINK I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE 
STANDING PREENING IN FRONT OF THE 
MIRROR GETTING NICE I WANT YOU 
CONCENTRATING ON THE JOB SOMETIMES 
HAVING GOOD SMART IMAGE MIGHT GO 
AGAINST YOU 
POLITICIANS SHOULD BE 
SMART BECAUSE IT IS A MARK OF 
RESPECT FOR THE JOB THEY ARE DOING 
AND THE PEOPLE THEY ARE SERVING 
BUT IT IS ABOUT GETTING A BALANCE 
RIGHT WE EXPECT THEM OF COFFERS 
TO DO THEIR OF COURSE TO DO 
THEIR JOB VERY WELL BUT THESE ARE 
SOFT SKILLS AS WELL AS THEM HAVING 
THE SKILLS TO DO THE JOB AND HAVING 
THE MORAL CODE WE WANT THEM TO BE 
ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WE WANT PEOPLE 
TO RELATE TO THEM AS EVERY DAY AND 
NORMAL HUMAN BEINGS PEOPLE YOU 
WOULD WANT TO GO DOWN THE PUB WITH 
FOR A PINT OR HAVE AROUND FOR 
DINNER SO YOU CAN HAVE A 
CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY YOU CAN 
RE RATE RELATE TO 
I DON'T WANT A CONVERSATION WITH MY 
PRIME MINISTER I WANT MY PRIME 
MINISTER TO LEAD 
IT IS A SURVEY CARRIED OUT FOR 
WOMEN ON BEHALF OF WOMEN 
THEY MIGHT NOT BE ENTIRELY OH IT 
IS TWO THOUSAND WOMEN IS THAT 
REPRESENTATIVE 
IT IS INTERESTING REPRESENTATIVE IT DOES SHOW THAT IMAGE IS 
IMPORTANT AND THE REASON THE 
POLITICIANS SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON 
IMAGE IT DOES MATTER THE ONE BIT 
OF THE SURVEY THAT IS OUT OF KILTER 
IS THE IMPORTANCE THAT PEOPLE PUT 
ON POLITICIANS WIVES 
THAT SEEMS TO ME MADNESS AND ALSO 
UNTRUE UNTRUE CHERIE BLAIR TONY BLAIR GOT 
ELECTED DES DESPITE CHERIE WOMAN 
ON A BEDROOM STICK AND HE STILL GOT 
ELECTED ELECTED YOU CAN'T SAY THAT 
YOU HAVE 
IN THESE DAYS WE WANT TO FEEL WE 
KNOW OUR LEADERS YOUR PARTNER IS 
PART OF OF YOUR IMAGE IT IS PART 
OF THE PACKAGE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT 
OR NOT 
YOU ARE NOT VOTING FOR THE WIFE 
IT IS ABOUT HOW HUMAN BEINGS 
COMMUNICATE AND CONNECT WITH ONE 
ANOTHER 
THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY MRS. ANOTHER THATCHER GOT SO MANY VOTES BECAUSE 
DENIS WAS A GOOD BLOKE 
LOOK AT AT AMERICAN POLITICS AND 
THE WIFE AND THE PARTNER IS SO 
IMPORTANT IMPORTANT AND THE DENTIST AS WELL 
AT THIS STAGE IN AN ELECTORAL 
CAMPAIGN OR PROCESS MAYBE IMAGE IS 
MORE IMPORTANT BUT WHEN IT COMES 
TO A GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND 
WE LOOK AT THE POLICY I THINK 
PEOPLE VOTE ON THOSE 
WE WANT BOTH DON'T WE O. K. O. K. EVEN WOMEN MIGHT VOTE ON POLICIES 
IT IS A FEMALE SURVEY 
WE ARE 
YOU ARE IN MORE TROUBLE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW LOOK I MENTIONED THAT BECAUSE 
IT WAS SURVEY FOR AND BY WOMEN 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH SAYING THAT YOU YOU ARE RIGHT 
THIS IS BREAKFAST 
THE CHINESE EARTHQUAKE HAS RISEN 
THE DEATH TOLL HAS RISEN TO MORE 
THAN TEN THOUSAND AUTHORITIES A WARNING 
IT COULD BE HIGHER 
M. P.'S CALLING FOR S. A. T.'S TESTS TO BE 
SCRAPPED BECAUSE THEY ARE DAMAGING 
EDUCATION EDUCATION SWEET CAROLINE 
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN BILL 
CAUGHT UP WITH ONE OF POP'S MOST 
ENDURING AND SUCCESSFUL SINGER 
SONGWRITERS NEIL DIAMOND 
AND NOW A DIAMOND OF OUR VERY OWN 
SPARKLING IN THE BLUE PETER GARDEN 
WHAT A LOVELY START TO THE DAY 
ALTHOUGH IN SOME PART OF THE 
COUNTRY WE HAVE LEARNED VERY SUNNY 
SKIES ALTHOUGH IT IS A BIT BREEZY 
AND IT HIT HIS DULL THE CHANCES 
ARE IT WILL BRIGHTEN UP THE EAST 
COAST IS PRONE TO LOWER CLOUD THAT 
CLOUD HAS STREAM AS FAR INTO 
CENTRAL AREAS AS THE MIDLANDS BUT 
IT WILL PUSH BACK TO THE COAST FOR 
MOST OF US IN THE WEST WE HAVE 
BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINE TO ENJOY TO THE 
EAST WE ARE LOOKING AT THE COASTAL 
MCLEOD FOR THE NORTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND LOVELY SUNSHINE TO STOP THE 
DAY IN SAINT HELENS AND ROCHDALE 
BEAUTIFUL MORE CLOUD TOWARDS THE 
MIDLANDS EAST ANGLIA SUNNY THIS 
MORNING ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE 
ISLE OF WIGHT INTO THE SOUTH WEST 
THERE IS HIGH CLOUD AND A LIGHTER 
BREEZE IN WALES HIGH CLOUD AND 
SUNNY SKIES AND SIMILAR STORY IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND TWELVE DEGREES 
CELSIUS BY NINE AM IN BELFAST JUST AN 
ISOLATED RISK OF A SHOWER OR TWO 
TODAY ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH WEST 
WE COULD SEE ONE IN WALES OR THE 
SOUTH AND YOU WILL BE UNLUCKY IF 
YOU DO YOU CAN SEE HOW IT MELTS 
BACK TO THE COAST BUT IF IT DOES 
STICK OVER THE EAST COAST IT WILL 
HOLD BACK THE TEMPERATURES CLOUD 
WILL MOVE IN OVER THE WASH AREA AND 
EAST ANGLIA IN THE AFTERNOON 
OVERNIGHT WATCH HOW THE CLOUD 
COMES IN OFF THE NORTH SEA AND 
PUSHES ACROSS SCOTLAND AND INTO THE 
MIDLANDS NOT COLD NIGHT 
ALTHOUGH CHILLIER IN THE NORTH EAST 
OF SCOTLAND TOMORROW WE WILL START 
OFF WITH THE CLOUD ONCE AGAIN BUT 
SLOWER THAN TODAY IT WILL RETREAT 
BACK TOWARDS THE COAST SOME OF ITS 
TICKING AGAIN AWAY FROM THAT 
ANOTHER CRACKING DAY HOWEVER IN 
THE SOUTH WEST SHOWERS WILL ARRIVE 
HERALDING A BIT OF A CHANGE WITH 
RAIN ON THURSDAY AND MUCH LOWER 
TEMPERATURES THAN WE HAVE 
BEEN USED 
TO ON FRIDAY 
FIRST YOU HAVE A HELICOPTER FLYING 
OVER NOW AN AEROPLANE WHAT IS 
GOING ON OUT THERE 
WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS AND 
WILDLIFE IN HERE AS WELL IT IS 
BUSY PLACE THE BLUE PETER GARDEN 
AT THIS TIME 
IT SOUNDED LIKE THE RED ARROWS 
FLYING OVER 
OR IT IS THE AEROPLANE TAKING 
DECLAN OFF TO HIS DESERT ISLAND 
I CAN ROLL UP MY TROUSERS AND PUT A 
KNOTTED HANDKERCHIEF ON MY HEAD 
WE WERE IN FRANCE A WEEK OR SO AGO 
TALKING ABOUT THE HIGH VALUE OF THE 
EURO AND WHAT IT WAS DOING TO OUR 
HOLIDAY PLANS THERE WAS TALK WE 
MIGHT CONSIDER PUTTING A FOREIGN 
HOLIDAYS THIS YEAR AND STAY AT HOME 
IN THE U. K. INSTEAD BECAUSE OF THE 
VALUE OF THE POUND AGAINST THE EURO 
WE HAVE HAD USED IN FROM HOLIDAY 
COMPANY THE OWNER OF FIRST CHOICE 
HOLIDAYS AND IT TELLS US BOOKINGS 
THIS YEAR ARE GOING AHEAD OR TWO 
UP BY EIGHT PER CENT SO THAT TALK OF PUTTING 
OFF FOREIGN HOLIDAYS WITH THAT 
COMPANY SEEMS WIDE OF THE MARK WE 
HAVE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE GOOD 
MORNING LOOKING AT YOUR FIGURES 
THERE IS NO SIGN WE ARE REINING IN 
ON OF FOREIGN HOLIDAYS THIS YEAR 
THAT'S RIGHT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE 
SAYING IT IS AN ESSENTIAL AND THEY 
WILL CUT BACK ON OTHER EXPENDITURES 
BUT NOT GIVE UP THEIR ANNUAL 
OVERSEAS HOLIDAYS 
IF YOU LOOK AT 
THE TYPICAL HOLIDAY BUDGET FAMILY 
BUDGET IT HAS BEEN HIT WITH HIGHER 
COUNCIL TAX HIGHER FUEL COSTS THE 
ANNUAL HOLIDAY IS STILL IN A 
PROTECTED PLACE 
I THINK THAT IS 
RIGHT AND IT SAYS THE IMPORTANCE OF 
THAT HOLIDAY THAT THEY NEED THE 
BREAK EVEN MORE 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
EURO THE POUND IS NOT GOING AS FAR 
AS IT DID ON THE CONTINENT ARE YOU 
SEEN ANY EFFECT ON THAT EITHER ON 
YOUR BUSINESS OR YOUR CUSTOMERS WE WE BOUGHT ALL THE EUROS LAST YEAR AND 
WE ARE PASSING THE BENEFIT ON TO 
OUR CUSTOMERS 
IS THAT CRAFTINESS 
OR IS IT LUCKY 
THAT IS THE WAY WE 
RUN THE BUSINESS WE BUY IN ADVANCE 
NEXT YEAR YOU MIGHT HAVE A BIT OF 
PROBLEM AS THE EURO'S YOU ARE 
PAYING FOR NOW IS MORE EXPENSIVE 
WE WILL RENEGOTIATE WITH HOTELIER'S 
TO PUT PRICES DOWN 
SO YOU WILL PUT 
THE SQUEEZE ON THEM 
ABSOLUTELY WE 
SHARE THE PAIN TOGETHER HIGHER HIGHER FUEL BILLS AIRLINES HAVE 
SURCHARGES FOR THEIR FLIGHTS YOU 
DO NOT PUT SURCHARGES ON YOUR 
HOLIDAYS 
WE HAVE A SMALL SURCHARGE HOLIDAYS AT THE MOMENT ON ARE SHORT AND 
MEDIUM HAUL HOLIDAYS OF FIVE PER 
CUSTOMER CUSTOMER MORE AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK AM 
NOW HE IS ONE OF THE MOST ENDURING 
AND SUCCESSFUL SINGER SONGWRITERS

MEMORABLE SONGS OF THE LAST FEW

DISASTER THIS IS DESTRUCTION ON AN 
ENORMOUS SCALE RESCUERS MUST 
BATTLE MOUNTAINS OF RUBBLE TO SAVE 
EACH LIVE TWO SCHOOL COLLAPSES ARE

ONE SECOND WE COULD LOOSE A 
SURVIVOR THE STATE NEWSAGENCY SAYS 
OFFICIALS HAVE LOST CONTACT WITH FIFTEEN 
BRITISH TOURISTS IN THE AREA BUT 
THE FOREIGN OFFICE HAS NOT BEEN 
ABLE TO CONFIRM THE REPORT FEARING 
AFTERSHOCKS MANY ARE STAYING AWAY 
FROM BUILDINGS THIS IS CHINA'S 
WORST EARTHQUAKE SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
AND HAS HIT THE COUNTRY'S MOST 
POPULATED AREA THERE ARE STILL 
PLACES WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN REACHED 
COMMUNICATION LINKS ARE DOWN THERE 
IS STILL NO REAL INDICATION OF HOW 
BAD THINGS ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE REMAIN UNACCOUNTED FOR 
SEEING THE POWER OF THE EARTHQUAKE 
IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE 
DEATH TOLL IS EXPECTED TO CLIMB 
MUCH MUCH HIGHER 
LET'S GET THE LATEST FROM OUR 
CORRESPONDENT WHO JOINS US FROM 
BEIJING WE ARE HEARING THE DEATH 
TOLL EXPECTED TO GO HIGHER 
ESPECIALLY AS RESCUE WORKERS HAVE 
ONLY JUST GOT TO THE EPICENTRE YES YES IT HAS TAKEN THEM TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO GET 
THERE WHICH GIVES YOU A AN IDEA OF 
THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM THE COB 
CERTED EFFORTS OF THE COMMUNIST 
PARTY OF THE ARMY OF THE AIR 
FORCE HAVE TRIED TO GET TO THIS 
AREA DUJIANGYAN COUNTY IT HAS 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE NOTHING HAS BEEN 
HEARD FROM THEM SINCE THE 
EARTHQUAKE HIT NOW WE ARE HEARING 
THIRTEEN HUNDRED TROOPS HAVE GOT IN THERE 
THROUGH MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN HEAVY 
RAIN WE ARE HEAR FROM THE FOREIGN 
OFFICE IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES 
THEY ARE CONFIRMING THAT POSSIBLY 
THERE WERE BRITISH TOURISTS IN THE 
AREA IT IS A VERY PICTURESQUE PART 
OF SHINAFPLT IT IS THE MAIN 
BREEDING AREA FOR CHINESE GIANT 
PANDAS IT IS VERY POPULAR WITH 
TOURISTS THERE WERE REPORTS THAT 
FIFTEEN BRITS WERE UNACCOUNTED FOR AND 
THE FOREIGN OFFICE IS RELEASING A 
NUMBER WHICH CAN BE REACHED ON 
THEIR WEBSITE FOR ANYONE CONCERNED 
ABOUT RELATIVES WHO MAY BE MISSING 
IN THAT PART OF CHINA 
WE ARE 
GETTING THAT INFORMATION HERE AS 
WELL THE FOREIGN OFFICE SAYING THE 
BRITISH EMBASSY IS TRYING TO 
CONTACT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN 
REPORTED MISSING THANK YOU WE 
WILL COME BACK TO YOU LATER 
THERE ARE MORE GLOOMY ECONOMIC 
FIGURES OUT FROM THE HIGH STREET 
AND THE PROPERTY MARKET NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF 
SURVEYORS REPORTED HOUSE PRICE 
FALLS IN APRIL THAT IS THE MOST 
NEGATIVE OUTLOOK FOR THIRTY YEARS 
RETAIL FIGURES HAVE FALLEN 
CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR SEEING THEIR 
WEAKEST GROWTH IN EIGHT YEARS 
GOOD MORNING DECLAN THE SURVEYORS 
NOT JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE LEVEL OF 
HOUSE PRICES BUT THE LACK OF 
ACTIVITY AS WELL 
YES SURVEYORS 
ARE SAYING THERE IS EFFECTIVELY A 
STRIKE IN THE HOUSING MARKET ON 
ONE SIDE YOU HAVE BUYER HOSS ARE 
NOT TERRIBLY INTERESTED IN BUYING 
PROPERTY THE NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY 
FIRST TIME BUYERS HAS FALLEN FOR 
THE SEVENTEENTH MONTH IN A ROW YOU HAVE 
THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE HOUSES AND 
FLATS THEY ARE NOT PUTTING THEM ON 
THE MARKET IN FACT THEY ARE 
WITHDRAWING PROPERTYS FROM THE 
MARKET WHICH HAVE BEEN ON SALE FOR 
SOME TIME BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY 
WILL NOT GET A GOOD PRICE FOR IT AT 
THE MOMENT NOW THE SURVEYORS SAY 
THE INTERESTING POINT IS WHAT IT 
MEANS FOR THE REST OF THE ECONOMY 
IF YOU HAVE A FALL IN THE NUMBER OF 
HOUSES BEING SOLD AND THAT NUMBER 
IS DOWN ONE THIRD FROM A YEAR AGO 
IF THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES BEING 
BOUGHT AND SOLD IS DOWN IT MEANS 
THAT PEOPLE ARE BUYING FEWER 
CARPETS FEWER FRIDGES AND FREEZERS 
THE ITEMS YOU BUY IF YOU GO INTO A 
NEW HOUSE OR IF YOU SPRUCE THINGS 
UP THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE 
SEE THE NUMBERS FROM THE HIGH 
STREET TODAY A SLIDE IN THE 
PROPERTY MARKET IS NOW BEING FELT 
ON THE HIGH STREET AS WELL 
IN YESTERDAY'S PROGRAMME WE TALKED 
ABOUT S. A. T.'S FOR CHILDREN ACROSS 
ENGLAND WELL CRITICISM OF THOSE 
TESTS WELL ACCORDING TO M. P.'S S. A. T.'S

THE RESPONSE FROM THE COUNTRY'S 
MILITARY RULERS AS UNACCEPT TAABLY 
SLOW THE OFFICIAL DEATH TOLL IS THREE 
TWO THOUTHOUFEEM PEOPLE BUT FOREIGN 
AID WORKERS SAY THE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE 
BUT FOREIGN AID WORKERS SAY THE 
TOLL COULD BE HIGHER THAN THAT SEX 
AND THE CITY RECEIVED A BIG SCREEN 
MAKOVER MAKOVER NOW USUALLY THEY FIGHT LIKE CATS

RETRIEVER FROM CHESHIRE SEEMS TO BE 
BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE AS WELL

THOSE ARE THIS MORNING'S MAIN 
STORIES N. A FEW MINUTES WE WILL 
LOOK AT HOW THE RISING COST OF 
LIVING IS FORCES ONE IN THREE NEW 
MUMS BACK TO WORK BEFORE THEY SAY 
THEY ARE READY THE CURRENT SYSTEM 
OF S. A. T.'S ACROSS ENGLAND IS DAMAGING 
CHILDREN'S EDUCATION ACCORDING TO 
M. P.'S THAIFPLT ARE CALL FOG R. A 
RADICAL CHANGE LET'S SPEAK TO 
JULIA GEORGE SHE IS WITH FAMILY 
GOING THROUGH S. A. T.'S THIS WEEK GOOD 
MORNING THE THIS FAMILY ARE HAVING 
A TESTING TIME ELEVEN YEAR OLD RHYS 
HAD SCIENCE YESTERDAY ONE OF HIS 
BEST SUBJECTS HE HAS LITERACY 
TODAY HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
IT IS NERVE RACKING IT IS NOT MY 
BEST SUBJECT SCIENCE AND MATHS I 
AM SECURE WITH 
TELL ME HOW MUCH OF 
A FOCUS THERE HAS BEEN AT YOUR THE TESTS WELL IT IS THE 
BIGGEST THING FOR A PRIMARY SCHOOL 
REALLY THEY HAVE PREPARED US FROM 
RECEPTION KIND OF RIGHT UP TO 
YEAR SIX 
DO THEY HAVE SPECIAL 
CLASSES AS WELL 
YES SOME PEOPLE 
GO IN BOOSTER CLASSES WHICH MEANS 
THEY MISOUT ON THINGS LIKE P. E. 
FOOTBALL 
I BET THAT DOES NOT GO FOOTBALL DOWN TOO WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THE EFFECTS OF OF THE TEST ARE THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD ARGUE IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW SCHOOLS AND 
INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN ARE DOING I I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW 
CHILDREN ARE DOING BUT IN THE PAST 
WE HAD END OF YEAR LITTLE TESTS 
WITHIN THE CLASS AND THE TEACHER 
SORT OF MARKED THOSE AND THEN 
ASSESSED THE CHILDREN THEN L. THINK 
THERE IS A LOT OF STRUCTURE TOWARDS 
THESE EXAMS SOMETIMES TEACHERS ARE 
NOT AS FREE TONE GAUGE THE CHILDREN 
THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME THEY NEED 
TO PUSH FORWARD ON THESE TESTS YOU YOU HAD A PARENT'S ERGE A COUPLE OF A 
PARENT'S ERGE A COUPLE OF MONTHS 
AGO WHAT WAS THE MESSAGE FROM THE 
TEACHER 
IT WAS CENTRED AROUND THE TEACHER FACT THEY WERE STUDYING FROM THE 
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR TO DO S. A. T.'S 
MY VIEW WAS THE TEACHER DIDN'T GET 
TIME TO KNOW THE PUPILS PROPERLY 
AND THEY WERE FORCED INTO A 
POSITION TO TRAIN THEM TO STUDY FOR 
THESE PARTICULAR TYPES OF TESTS IT 
IS A WAY OF TESTING THEM OF COURSE 
I FELT IT WAS TOO FORMAL AND 
STRUCTURED FOR THAT 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH SO WHICH TEST TODAY 
TODAY IS 
LITERACY 
FINGERS CROSSED FOR RHYS LITERACY AND HIS LITERACY TEST TODAY THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS JUST TO 
RECAP IS CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE AS 
TESTED AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY BEING 
TESTED THERE SHOULD BE MORE 
ASSESSMENT ON HOW TEACHERS THINK 
PUPILS ARE DOING AND THERE SHOULD 
BE RANDOM ASSESSMENTS SO NOT EVERY 
CHILD IN EVERY PART OF THE KUNDUZ 
THE TEST EVERY TIME GOOD LUCK IF 
YOU ARE DOING S. A. T.'S OR GCSES TODAY 
NOW IT HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE FOR 
MANY PEOPLE SINCE THEY SAW THE FILM 
JAWS FOR ONE MAN IT BECAME A 
REALITY WHEN HE WAS ATTACKED BY A 
GREAT WHITE AS HE WAS SWIMMING OFF 
TO COAST OF SOUTH WEST AUSTRALIA 
TERRIFYING HE HAS LIVED TO TELL 
THE TALE HE CAN SPEAK TO US FROM 
HIS HOSPITAL BED HOW ARE YOU 
I AM 
WELL THANKS ALL THINGS CONSIDERED 
WHAT HAPPENED 
O. K. WELL IT WAS 
EARLY ON SATURDAY MORNING HERE IN 
ALBANY L. WENT TO THE BEACH TO HAVE 
AN EARLY MORNING JOG AND SWIM THE 
SUN WAS COMING UP IT WAS A 
BEAUTIFUL CLEAR MORNING AND THE 
OCEAN WAS GLASSED OVER IT WAS A 
PERFECT CONDITION FOR SWIMMING 
THERE WERE SOME DOLPHINS I COULD 
SEE SWIMMING NEAR THE SWIMMING 
CONES THAT WAS UNUSUAL BUT 
DOLPHINS ARE NOTHING TO BE 
CONCERNED ABOUT L. PREPARED TO GO 
INTO MY SWIM L. WENT EIGHTEEN METRES OFF 
SHORE THERE WERE YELLOW BUOYS THAT 
PEOPLE USE AS A SWIMMING CIRCUIT L. 
COMPLETED ONE CIRCUIT OF THE BUOYS 
I WAS TREADING WATER AND DECIDING 
WHETHER OR NOT TO GO AGAIN THERE 
WAS ANOTHER COUPLE SWIMMING AT THE 
OTHER END L. NOTICED A GREY SHAPE 
COMING TOWARDS ME L. THOUGHT IT WAS 
A DOLPHIN I SPOTTED EARLIER AS IT 
GOT CLOSER I REALISED IT WAS TOO 
BIG THE NEXT THING I KNEW IT 
BUMPED INTO ME L. REALISED IT WAS A 
SHARK IT SEIZED ME BY THE LOWER 
LEFT LEG AND BEGAN TO DRAG ME 
UNDERWATER AND OUT TO SEA AS I WAS 
GOING ALONG THE MEMORY CAME TO ME 
OF WATCHING A DOCUMENTARY FILM WITH 
MY SON WHERE I REPORT SEEING A 
SURFER DRAGGED UNDER WATER BY HIS 
TOW ROPE HE POKED THE SHARK IN THE 
GILLS L. DIDN'T FIND THE GILLS BUT 
I CAME ACROSS THE EYE IT WAS BIG 
I WAS ABLE TO FIT MOST OF MY HAND 
INTO HIS EYE 
I WAS WINCHING THEN 
THE THOUGHT OF YOU PUTTING YOUR 
FIST IN HIS EYE BUT THAT WAS 
ENOUGH TO GET HIM TO RELEASE HIS 
TEETH AND WHAT HE SWAM AWAY 
NO HE 
RELEASED ME AT THAT POINT L. NOTED 
BACK TO THE SURFACE BECAUSE I WAS 
LOSING A LOT OF BLOOD HE CONTINUED 
TO CIRCLE ME L. TOOK A NUMBER OF 
BREATHES PUT MY HEAD IN THE WATER 
SO I COULD WATCH HIM WITH THE 
INTENTION IF HE CAME BACK AGAIN I 
WOULD FIGHT HIM OFF WHEN I COULD I 
YELLED OUT TO PEOPLE ON THE BEACH I 
HAD BEEN BITTEN BY A SHARK THE 
OTHER SWIMMERS SWAM CLOSE TO ME 
THEY WERE IN THE WATER THE SHARK 
SWAM TOWARDS THEM THEY 
CAN I 
JUST ASK WHEN YOU SAID YOU LOST A 
LOT OF BLOOD AND HE TOOK A CHUNK 
OUT OF YOUR CALF HOW BAD IS IT NOW 
DID THEY REPAIR IT CAN YOU WALK O. K. 
WHEN YOU GET OUT OF HOSPITAL 
I AM 
CERTAINLY NOT WALKING ANYWHERE AT 
THE MOMENT A LOT OF THE CALF HAS 
GONE THERE WAS A LOT OF NERVE 
DAMAGE THE DOCTORS DID A FANTASTIC 
JOB IN RECONSTRUCTING IT IT WILL 
BE A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE I KNOW HOW 
MUCH USE OF THAT LEG I'LL HAVE HE 
SEVERED THE PATELLA ON MY RIGHT LEG 
THAT IS DAMAGED AS WELL L. WANT TO 
SAY THE ONLY REASON I HERE TO 
SPEAK TO YOU TODAY IS THE ALBANY 
VOLUNTEERING SURF CLUB THEY WERE 
ON THE BEACH AS I WAS STARTING TO 
SWIM IN I WAS GETTING TIRED THIS 
LADY CAME OUT AND SWAM TO ME AND 
MANAGED TO BRING ME IN THE OTHER 
COUPLE MADE THEIR WAY IN AS WELL 
THEY WERE LIKELY TO BE AT THREAT AS 
WELL WE REALLY THANK YOU FOR 
TAKING TIME TO SPEAK TO US L. DON'T 
SUPPOSE YOU WILL GO BACK IN THE 
WATER NOT FOR A LITTLE WHILE NO 
THERE'S A FIST WENT INTO THE 
SHARK'S THAT'S HOW BIG THE SHARKS 
ARE 
I KNOW 
STILL TO COME ARE CARRY ON UP THE CARPET THE SEX 
AND THE CITY GIRLS ARRIVE IN LONDON 
FOR THE WORLD PREMIERE OF THEIR NEW 
FILM FILM I GOT A SISTER 
AND SHE CAN SING 
BETH ROWLEY THE RISING SOUL SINGER 
WILL BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT HER 
LATEST SINGLE SO SUBLIME 
WILL IT BE HAPPY DAYS OR SINGING 
THE BLUES 
IT WILL CERTAINLY BE HAPPY DAYS 
BECAUSE TODAY ONCE AGAIN THERE IS 
QUITE A LOT OF SUNSHINE AROUND IT 
IS BREEZY THIS MORNING AND THE 
BREEZE IS TAKING THE EDGE OFF THE 
TEMPERATURES BUT THE TEMPERATURES 
TODAY WILL STILL BE ABOVE AVERAGE 
FOR MOST OF US FOR THE TIME OF THE 
YEAR ON THE SATELLITE YOU CAN SEE 
WHERE WE HAVE GOT THE CLOUD THE 
SATELLITE GOES BACK TWELVE HOURS WE 
ALSO HAVE CLOUD WHICH ISN'T SHOWING 
UP SO WELL DOWN THE EAST COAST OF 
SCOTLAND AND PARTS OF THE EAST 
COAST OF ENGLAND FOR SCOTLAND WE 
WILL CONTINUE WITH THIS CLOUD FOR 
WEE WHILE YET THE NORTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND SEEING A LOT OF SUNSHINE 
FIRST THING FROM THE PENNINES 
EASTWARDS DOWN TO THE MIDLANDS WE 
STILL HAVE THAT CLOUD ELSEWHERE 
IN THE SOUTH EAST LOVELY BLUE 
SKIES LIKE WE HAVE HERE IN LONDON 
BUT IT IS BREEZY INTO THE SOUTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND HERE THERE'S SOME 
HIGH CLOUD SO THE SUNSHINE AT TIMES 
A LITTLE BIT MORE HAZY WE ARE ALSO 
LOOKING AT BREAKS IN THE CLOUD 
SOME BLUE SKIES TOO ACROSS WALES 
SOME HAZY SUNSHINE FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND TODAY THERE IS AN 
ISOLATED RISK OF SHOWER THE 
GREATEST RISK WILL BE IN THE NORTH 
WEST WE COULD CATCH ONE IN WALES 
OR THE SOUTH WEST THROUGH THE DAY 
AS YOU CAN SEE THE CLOUD BURNS 
BACK TOWARDS THE EAST COAST BUT IT 
COULD CLING TO PARTS OF THE NORTH 
EAST OF ENGLAND AND LATER WE WILL 
HAVE SOME MORE COMING IN AROUND THE 
WASHINGTON THAT WILL HOLD BACK THE 
TEMPERATURE FOR THE REST OF US 
WARM AFTERNOON AS WE GO THROUGH 
THE NIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE CLOUD 
COMING IN FROM THE NORTH SEA AND 
PUSHING OVER IN THE DIRECTION OF 
THE WEST FOR THE WEST WE WILL 
HAVE CLEAR SKIES SO CLEAR SKIES 
FIRSS THING IN THE MORNING MEANS A 
LOT OF SUNSHINE FIRST THING IN 
THE MORNING MEANS A LOT OF SUNSHINE 
FOR SOME IT WILL LINGER LOOK AT 
THOSE TEMPERATURES THIRTEENS ARE CLOSER 
TO WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT AT THIS 
TIME OF THE YEAR AS WE PUSH INTO 
THE SUNSHINE TWENTY THREE IS WAY ABOVE 
AVERAGE ON THURSDAY A REAL CHANGE 
AS RAIN PUSHES INTO THE SOUTH AND 
BY FRIDAY TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
LOT LOWER WE WILL BE LOOKING AT 
THIRTEEN TO SIXTEEN C. THAT IS THE FORECAST HAVE HAVE YOU GOT A SOUND EFFECTS RECORD OUT 
THERE 
IT IS SO NOISY OUT HERE THIS THERE MORNING WE HAVE DOGS BARKING IN 
THE PARK NEXT TO US 
WHO LETS THE 
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT 
SHE IS BEING 
HOUNDED YOU KNOW 
THAT IS TERRIBLE 
THEY ARE IN THE PARK NEXT TO ME DO DO SOMETHING TAKE THEM FOR A DO WARK 
WE TALK ABOUT NEW PRICES GOING UP 
ALMOST EVERY DAY AND THE RISING 
COST OF LIVING IS FORCING NEW MUMS 
BACK TO WORK A SURVEY SUGGESTS ONE 
IN THREE PARENTS ARE CHOOSING WORK 
OVER STAYING AT HOME WITH THE 
BABIES TIM MUFFETT IS JOINING US 
FROM A NURSERY IN SOUTH WEST LONDON 
THEY ARE STILL HAVING THEIR 
BREAKFAST HELLO TIM 
IT IS GETTING BUSIER PEAK 
TIME NOW MUMS AND DADS LEAVING 
THEIR KIDS HERE MANY OF THEM GOING 
OFF TO WORK ARE THEY DOING THE 
RIGHT THING WHAT ABOUT STAYING AT 
HOME AND LOOKING AFTER THEIR 
CHILDREN THERE IT DOES SEEM FOR 
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE THAT IS 
BECOMING A LUXURY THEY CAN'T AFFORD 
IN ONE WEEK'S TIME ANGELA WILL 
FINISH HER MATERNITY LEAVE AND 
RETURN TO WORK SHE IS DREADING THE 
DAY SHE PARTS FROM ELEVEN MONTH OLD 
JOSEPH BUT LIKE MANY SHE HAS 
LITTLE CHOICE 
I KNOW I'M GOING TO 
MISS HIM L. HAVE NO CHOICE I HAVE 
TO GO BACK L. 
HAVE TO GO BACK WE HAVE BILLS TO PAY A MORTGAGE TO 
PAY MY HUSBAND WORKS BUT I HAVE TO 
WORK TO KEEP UP OUR REPAYMENTS ON 
OUR MORTGAGE AND ALSO PAY BILLS AND 
FOOD SHOPPING EVERYTHING'S GONE UP 
LATELY HE IS STARTING TO DEVELOP 
AND STARTING TO HE IS LEARNING TO 
WALK I WANT TO SEE ALL THOSE 
MILESTONES BUT I WON'T BE ABLE TO 
THE NUMBER OF STAY AT HOME PARENTS 
IS AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL FOR FIFTEEN YEARS 
DOWN A FIFTH MORE THAN A THIRD OF 
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN UNDER TWO 
NOW HAVE BOTH PARENTS IN WORK AND 
ONLY AROUND ONE IN TEN OF THOSE 
WORKING PARENTS CHOSE TO RETURN 
THE VAST MAJORITY SAID IN REALITY 
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ALTERNATIVE 
JOSEPH WILL BE IN GOOD HANDS 
ANGELA'S MUM WILL LOOK AFTER HIM 
EVEN STILL ANGELA COULDN'T BEAR THE 
THOUGHT OF RETURNING TO WORK FULL 
TIME SO SHE DECIDED TO LET HER 
CAREER AND SALARY TAKE HIT SO 
THAT SHE CAN BE AT HOME ON MONDAYS 
I WENT BACK WITH A VIEW TO DEMOTE 
MYSELF AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BE AN 
ART DIRECTOR I JUST WANTED TO BE A 
GRAPHIC DESIGNER THAT'S A PAY CUT 
AND LESS DAYS A WEEK BUT IT'S GOOD 
BECAUSE HE'S MY PRIORITY AT THE 
MOMENT 
SO ANGELA WILL SOON BE MOMENT SPENDING HER FIRST DAYS AWAY FROM 
HER LITTLE BOY IT WILL BE 
EMOTIONAL BUT AS AN INCREASING 
NUMBER OF MUMS HAVE DISCOVERED 
PRETTY MUCH INEVITABLE 
ACCORDING TO USWITCH ONLY SEVEN PER CENT OF 
PARENTS AS A WHOLE SPEND FULL TIME 
AT HOME WITH THEIR CHILDREN LET'S 
HAVE A QUICK CHAT TO SHARON HOW 
EASY A DECISION WAS IT FOR YOU TO 
MAKE TO SEND THEM HERE 
IT'S ALWAYS 
DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU ARE REALLY 
PULLED IN TWO DIRECTIONS SO IT 
MAKES LIFE MUCH EASIER THE FACT 
THAT I WORK FINANCIALLY FOR US SO 
THERE WASN'T REALLY MUCH OF A 
CHOICE ABOUT IT THE FACT THAT IT'S 
SUCH A LOVELY NURSERY DOES MAKE 
THAT CHOICE EASIER AND MY TWO OLDER 
CHILDREN CAME HERE AS WELL SO I 
KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT AND IT'S 
FANTASTIC FACILITIES SO THAT MADE 
LIFE EASIER 
SOME PEOPLE HAVE 
POINTED OUT THAT GOING BACK TO WORK 
FOR MANY MUMS ISN'T SUCH A BAD 
THING THERE ARE CERTAIN BENEFITS 
TO IT 
SURE L. DO ENJOY IT I'M 
VERY FORTUNATE SO I WORK PART TIME 
SO I GET ALL THE BENEFIT OF WORKING 
AND KEEPING MY MIND ACTIVE BUT THEN 
I GET SOME TIME WITH THE OLDER 
CHILDREN THE BIGGEST IMPACT IS ON 
THE YOUNGER ONE 
THANKS EVER SO 
MUCH IT IS A PRETTY CONTENTIOUS 
ISSUE WHAT IS THE BEST THING FOR 
THE CHILDREN MANY SAY NURSERIES 
ARE GREAT MANY WANT TO STAY AT 
HOME THOUGH BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD 
TO TO COSMOPOLITAN COCKTAILS FABULOUS 
FROCKS AND SEXY SHOES 
IT IS 
BREAKFAST 
CERTAINLY IS ON YOUR BREAKFAST WARDROBE MANHATTAN'S FAMOUS 
FOURSOME ARE BACK AND THIS TIME 
WITH A BIG SCREEN ADAPTATION OF SEX 
AND THE CITY 
IT HAS BEEN FOUR 
YEARS SINCE FANS SAID GOODBYE TO 
THOSE SASSY GIRLS IN A MINUTE WE 
WILL BE ASKING WHAT MADE IT SO 
ICONIC FIRST SOME OF THE ACTION 
FROM THE NEW FILM 
AFTER YEARS OF 
LIVING IN THE CITY I ASSUMED IF MY 
FRIENDS AND I EVER GOT OUR 
FAIRYTALE ENDINGS THAT WOULD BE THE 
END OF THE STORY HELLO WELCOME HELLO WELCOME HOME 
I ALWAYS KNEW SHE WOULD MARRY HOME BIG 
YOU THOUGHT THAT AFTER THE BIG SECOND BREAK UP 
YEAH REAL LIFE 
TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE L. WANT YOU THAT IS 
WHAT I WANT 
ALWAYS HAS A TWIST SO SO WHAT IS THE SPECIAL MAGIC DAVID 
WATERS IS STYLE EDITOR ON MEN'S 
HEALTH MAGAZINE AND TONI JONES 
FASHION EDITOR OF THE SUN WE ARE 
THE LUCKY ONES 
YOU ARE THE VERY 
LUCKY ONES 
A SELECT FEW WE KNOW 
WHAT HAPPENS 
YOU HAVE BEEN SWORN 
TO SECRECY 
CAN'T SAY A WORD IT IS 
A MURDER MYSTERY CAN'T TELL YOU 
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END BILL 
HADN'T SEEN THE SERIES 
I HAD SEEN IT A COUPLE OF TIMES 
I HADN'T SEEN THE SERIES AT ALL 
WHY IS IT SUCH A BIG THING 
I THINK 
IT CAUGHT THE FLAVOUR OF THE TIME 
YOU KNOW THE TEN YEARS AGO WHEN IT 
FIRST CAME ON TO THE SCREENS AND IT 
BROKE ALL THESE TABOOS WOMEN 
TALKING SO EXPLICITLY ABOUT THEIR 
PERSONAL LIVES WOMEN GOT VERY 
EXCITED ABOUT THE FASHION FOR ME 
AS A BLOKE I THOUGHT IT WAS 
HILARIOUS THERE WERE SOME GREAT 
LINES IN IS A MAN SAMANTHA WAS 
JUST OUT OF CONTROL 
SHE IS THE 
SEX MAD ONE 
SHE IS 
ALL OF THE 
FASHIONS ARE PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS 
THEY ARE MAKING BIG STATEMENT IS 
IT POSITIVE STATEMENT THOUGH DEFINITELY 
DO YOU LIKE THE DEFINITELY OUTFITS 
I DON'T LIKE ALL OF THEM OUTFITS I LIKE THE FACT THEY ARE SO 
INDIVIDUAL AND SOME OF THE OUTFITS 
ARE SO CRAZY THEY COULDN'T DRESS 
TO SAVE THEIR LIVES AND THEY 
BROUGHT ON THIS MAD STYLIST AND SHE 
GAVE THEM EACH A DEFINITIVE 
CHARACTER CARRIE BRADSHAW ALWAYS 
WEARS CRAZY OUTFITS IT WAS EQUAL 
OPPORTUNITY FASHION YOU DIDN'T 
HAVE TO BE RICH OR SKINNY TO LOOK 
LIKE HER 
SHE WEARS LABELS SHE SHE WILL PUT ON A PAIR OF SHORTS WITH 
FUR COAT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
DID YOU TELL OUR RESEARCHER YOU 
THINK TO YOURSELF WOULD CARRIE WEAR 
THIS 
I THINK WHAT WOULD CARRIE DO THIS I DON'T 
IT WAS GROUND BREAKING 
BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE 
HEARD ABOUT WHAT SOME NEW YORK 
WOMEN THINK AND SPEAK AND THE WAY 
THEY RELATE TO EACH OTHER IS THERE 
A SENSE THAT IT HAS AN ANTI MALE 
BIAS 
THEY DO ALL END UP WITH THE BIAS MAN AT THE END 
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY 
SAY THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT 
ALLEGEDLY 
IT MIGHT BE A HUGELY ALLEGEDLY TRAGIC ENDING 
HOW OLD FASHIONED IS 
THAT IT IS JANE AUSTEN THE GIRL 
ENDS UP WITH THE GUY L. DON'T THINK 
IT IS AS RADICAL AS PEOPLE MIGHT 
WANT TO BELIEVE 
IN THE 
CONVERSATIONS THAT THEY HAVE 
SOMETIMES SOME PEOPLE FELT ON THE 
DEFENSIVE BEING MEN WATCHING IT 
NOT YOU 
NO L. DIDN'T FEEL THAT 
I'M A BIG BOY I CAN TAKE IT LIKE 
MAKING FUN OF BLOKES WE SHOULD BE 
BIGGER THAN ALWAYS FEELING WE ARE 
BEING ATTACKED 
IT IS JUST A BIT OF 
FRIPPERY 
THE PROGRESSIVE THING FRIPPERY ABOUT THE SHOW IS THE FRIENDSHIPS 
AMONGST THE FOUR LEAD WOMEN 
AH L. 
WANT TO ASK ABOUT THAT DOES ANY 
WOMAN HAVE THREE FRIENDS WHO THEY 
LINK ARMS AND THEY WALK DOWN THE 
STREET 
THAT IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T STREET HAVE A WIDE ANGLE CAMERA SO THEY 
HAVE TO KEEP IT VERY TIGHT 
IS THAT 
REPRESENTATIVE OF FRIENDSHIPS THAT THAT MIGHT BE OTT BUT THE WHOLE MAGIC OF 
NEW YORK AND THEIR OUTFITS THAT IS 
THE ROMANTIC SIDE OF THINGS ALL OF 
US LIKE TO THINK WE HAVE CLOSE 
FRIENDS THAT YOU CAN TALK TO THAT 
YOU WOULDN'T TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND 
ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND OR YOUR FAMILY 
ABOUT THESE FOUR GIRLS ARE LIKE 
THE MODERN NEW YORK FAMILY THEY 
COULD SHARE EVERYTHING WITH EACH 
OTHER AND WHETHER THEY ARE SINGLE 
OR MARRIED OR HAPPY OR SAD THEY 
ALWAYS HAD EACH OTHER TO COUNT ON 
THAT WAS THE JOY OF IT

DMITRY TURSUNOV IN THE FIRST 
OF THE HAMBURG MASTERS 
ONLY TWO WEEKS TO GO NOW BEFORE 
PARIS PARIS THE SPORTS MINISTER HAS 
WARNED FANS 
OF ZENIT SAINT PETERSBURG THEY COULD 
FACE POLICE ACTION IF THERE IS ANY 
RACIST ABUSE AT WEDNESDAY'S UEFA 
CUP FINAL IN MANCHESTER THE 
RUSSIAN TEAM WERE CHARGED AFTER 
PLAYERS SAY THEY WERE RATIONALLY 
ABUSED GERRY SUTCLIFFE SAYS THERE

GAMES POSTPONED TO HELP THEM 
PREPARE FOR THE FINAL 
ENGLAND'S FIRST TEST MATCH STARTS

PAUL COLLINGWOOD 
SAYS 
HE HAS SHAKEN OFF THE SHOULDER 
INJURY AND IS FIT ENOUGH TO PLAY 
THE BIGGEST DILEMMA COULD BE 
WHETHER TO PLACE MATTHEW HOGGARD 
HE COULD BE IN LINE FOR RECALL 
LOOK AT THIS 
DIEGO MARADONA HAS BEEN IN ACTION 
YESTERDAY YESTERDAY HE WAS INVOLVED IN A CHARITY MATCH 
HE 
GOOD SHAPE LOOK AT 
THIS FOR CONTROL 
HE LOOKED IN GOOD SHAPE LOOK AT THIS FOR CONTROL 
THIS FOR CONTROL NEW SKILLS DEVELOPED IN DIEGO 
MARADONA'S GYM AND HE HAS A LITTLE 
SKILLS LEFT IN HIM 
BUT PROBABLY AT ONE AND A HALF 
MILES AN HOUR HE GOT THAT PENALTY 
AND HE CONVERTED IT NOT AGAINST THE 
BEST GOALKEEPER IN THE WORLD 
BUT THE FINAL SCORE THERE SIX TO SIX 
IT IS NICE TO SEE HIM BACK IN SHAPE 
THIS IS THE PICTURE THAT STARTED 
ONE OF THE BIG GOLFING QUESTIONS 
THIS WAS AT LOCH LOMOND ONE OF THE 
SPEEDBOATS FLEW OFF THE LOCH AND 
INTO BUNKER 
ASKED WHAT 
WOULD 
HAPPEN IF YOUR BALL ENDED UP UNDER 
THE BOAT WE HAVE HAD LOADS OF E. 
MAILS AND THE ANSWER IF YOU HAVE A 
MAN 
MADE OBJECT 
IN BUNKER AND IF 
IT IS IMMOVE IMMOVABLE YOU MAY 
DROP TO WITHIN ONE CLUB LENGTH 
YOU GO CLUB LENGTH AND DROP IT OFF 
IF THE BOAT IS STILL IN THE WAY YOU 
HAVE TO CHIP IT OVER THE BUNKER 
YOU 
STROKE IF 
YOU GO OUTSIDE THE BUNKER BUT I 
LIKE THESE ANSWERS THE FACT THE 
BOAT IS IN THE BUNKER DOES THAT 
MEAN IT IS A WATER HAZARD 
BALL GETS STUCK UNDER 
A SPEEDBOAT JUST GET IN THE BOAT 
AND DO SOMETHING USEFUL AROUND THE 
LOCH AND HAVE GOOD DAY OUT AND 
FORGET THE GOLF 
I WILL BE IN MANCHESTER TOMORROW 
WHAT FOR 
AHEAD OF THE UEFA CUP 
FINAL HOPEFULLY I WILL BE SURROUND 
BY BY SCOTS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE 
GAME GAME THAT'S AN INVATEATION 
HOW DO YOU DECIDE DECIDE WHO TO 
VOTE FOR HOW PICK THE BEST LOOKING 
CANDIDATE AND THE ONE WITH THE MOST 
STYLISH SPOUSE WHAT'S WHAT AEN 
ONLINE AN WOULD HAVE 
US BELIEVE LET'S LOOK AT THE THREE 
MAIN PARTY LEADERS TRYING THEIR 
BEST TO LOOK FABULOUS 
ANYTHING FOR 
I KNOW 
YOU'LL GET ME THROUGH 
BECAUSE YOU'RE GORGEOUS I'D DO 
ANYTHING FOR YOU 
BECAUSE YOU'RE GORGEOUS I KNOW 
YOU'LL GET ME THROUGH QUENTIN 
LETTS IS 
FOR THE 
DAILY MAIL 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
GET RID OF OF PRIME MINISTER'S 
QUESTION TIME AND TURN THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS INTO A CATWALK WITH WE 
DECIDE WHETHER 
OR NOT TO VOTE FOR 
THEM THAT SEEMS TO BE THE 
IMPLICATION OF THIS HIGH MINDED 
POLL POLL IT WAS AN ONLINE SURVEY OF TWO THOUSAND 
WOMEN AND DISCOVERED THAT 
MORE THAN 
POLITICIAN 
BASED ON WHETHER THEY WOULD LIKE TO 
GO OUT TO DINNER WITH THEM 
I TAKE 
THAT WITH A PINCH OF SALT BUT IT 
DOES UNDERLINE 
IMAGE IN POLITICS TODAY 
WE REALLY GET TO KNOW OUR 
POLITICIANS THROUGH THE MEDIA AND 
THROUGH TELEVISION WHICH IS VISUAL 
IF IT GIVES US A SENSE THAT WE KNOW 
CAN RELATE TO THEM 
WE HAVE TO TAKE THEIR IMAGE 
SERIOUSLY WE CAN'T SAY IT IS A 
SUPERFICIAL TRYING TO CHEAT OR 
PRETEND THAT YOU ARE YOU ARE 
SOMETHING 
NOT IT IS 
PART OF YOUR COMMUNICATION 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS A STRONG 
MORAL CODE TO BE ABLE TO ADMIT HIS 
MISTAKES A A SOCIAL CONSCIENCE AND 
BE EMOTIONALLY THAT SOUNDS LIKE A METRO SEXUAL TO ME 
YOU HAVE TO WONDER HOW DID EDWARD 
HEATH GET ELECTED AS A BACHELOR SO 
THERE WAS NO MRS. METE 
MRS. HEATH 
THERE WAS THIRTY SEVEN YEARS YEARS 
THERE ARE OTHER BACHELORS IN 
POLITICS TODAY 
OBVIOUSLY IMAGE HAS SOME VALUE 
THEY WOULDN'T SPEND SO MUCH MONEY 
ON IT BUT 
IT DOES 
HAVE 
WITH POLICY IF YOU JUST THINK 
ABOUT TAKING POLICY OUT OF POLITICS 
IT IS NONSENSE YOU COULD HAVE 
GEORGE CLOONEY ELECTED ON A RACIST 
TICKET BECAUSE HIS POLICIES WOULD 
NOT MATTER 
YOU ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT GEORGE 
CLOONEY IS RACIST 
THAT'S A LUDICROUS EXAMPLE WHAT THE 
IMPLICATIONS OF THE SURVEY MAYBE 
I DON'T THINK THINK ANYONE IS 
SAYING IF YOU LOOK FANTASTIC IT IS 
OG IT IS A REFLECTION OF WHAT YOU 
ARE WHAT YOU STAND FOR WHAT YOUR 
VALUINGS ARE 
AND HOW 
COMMUNITY COMMUNICATE THEM TO THE 
WORLD HUMAN BEINGS HAVE EVOLVED TO 
MAKE INSTANT AND PROFOUND DECISION 
ABOUT PEOPLE BASED ON ON VISUAL 
CLUES IF GEORGE CLOONEY WENT 
DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY DANGER OF 
REALLY REALLY HANDSOME GORGEOUS 
MEN IN POLITICS IN BRITAIN THAT'S 
NOT THE CASE 
WHAT ABOUT THE THE SPOUSE QUESTION 
ON QUESTION JUDGING A POLITICIAN ON 
HIS OR OR HER SPOUSE MRS. BROWN IS 
A REAL GOLD PLATED CHAMPION SHE IS 
A TERRIFIC WOMAN AND IS CONDUCTING 
HERSELF WITH DIGNITY IN OFFICE AND 
YET PEOPLE SEEM NOT TO LIKE HER 
HUSBAND 
AND THAT'S 
SURVEY 
IS FLAWED BECAUSE IF WE JUST IF WE 
PLACE SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON THE 
IMPORTANCE OF THE WIFE GORDON 
BROWN WOULD BE DOING A 
LOT BETTER 
LIKEABILITY OR IS IT 
ABOUT JUST GETTING ON WITH THE JOB 
WHY DO WE NEED OUR POLITICIANS TO 
BE LIKABLE WE DON'T WANT TO GO OUT 
FOR DINNER 
WITH THEM YES WE 
WOULDN'T GET TO GO OUT TO DINNER 
WITH THEM USUALLY IT IS ABOUT 
HAVING PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN RELATE 
TO TO YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE THEM 
DO YOU 
NEED TO RELATE TO THEM YOU 
YOU HAVE TO FEEL THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT 
WE WANT FROM THEM AS LEADERS SO IT 
IS ABOUT THEY HAVE 
RESPONSIBILITY TO 
COMMUNICATE TO US 
WE WANT THEM TO DO A GREAT JOB BUT 
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PUT THAT 
ACROSS TO PEOPLE AND IMAGE IS PART 
OF 
THEY ARE SAYING HOW THEY SAY IT 
AND THE WAY THEY LOOK 
THERE IS A LOT FOR POLITICIANS TO 
LEARN IT MEANS IF WOMEN IF THIS 
SURVEY IS 
FROM THE HEART THAN PERHAPS WE HAD 
BEEN IMAGINING 
IF THIS SURVEY IS 
CORRECT THE REVEREND IAN PAISLEY 
WOULD BE THE FIRST TO ACCEPT THAT 
HE AIN'T GROVY HE MAY NOT BE THE 
SORT OF MAN YOU WOULD WARRANT TO GO 
TO THE PUB 
WITH BECAUSE 
HE DOESN'T 
DRINK AND HE IS HE IS FIRST 
MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
HE IS OUTGOING 
THIS IS SHALLOW END 
STUFF THIS POLL 
IT IS A CELEBRITY MAGAZINE BUT IT 
WAS PROBABLY LIGHT HEARTED 
DID THE READERS OF THIS MAGAZINE 
VOTE JUST AS 
THE DEPRESSING 
THING IS POLITICIANS WILL BELIEVE 
THIS AND SPEND EVEN MORE MONEY ON 
HAIRSPRAY 
WE BOTH AGREE THAT IMAGE HAIRSPRAY IS IMPORTANT IN POLITICS AND ANY 
PART OF PUBLIC LIFE 
I THINK YOU'D 
TRUST SOMEBODY IF THEY ARE A BIT 
SHAMBOLIC NOT SPEND TOO MUCH TIME 
IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR LIKE US 
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF HE IS GOING TO 
SAY SAY NOW THE WEATHER 
IS BEAUTIFUL START TO THE DAY 
ACROSS MANY PARTS OF THE BRITISH 
ISLES BUT WE DO HAVE MORE OF A 
BREEZE AND WE HAVE HAD TAKING THE 
EDGE OF THE TEMPERATURES NOT EVERY 
WERE IN THE BRITISH ISLES IS 
STARTING WITH GLORIOUS SUNSHINE 
WERE WE HAD THE CLOUD IT WAS BACK 
TWELVE HOURS TO MORE OR LESS A CURRENT 
POSITION WE DO HAVE CLOUD ACROSS 
THE EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND AND THE 
EAST OF ENGLAND AS FAR AS THE 
MIDLANDS FOR THE NORTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINE FROM 
THE PENNINES EASTWARDS AGAIN NO 
CLOUD AND THAT INCLUDES THE 
MIDLANDS AND AROUND THE WASH A 
NOTICEABLE BREEZE COMPARED TO WHAT 
WE HAVE ENJOYED FOR THE ISLE OF 
WIGHT HEADING INTO THE SOUTH WEST 
SUNSHINE SOME OF IT HAZY AND HAZY 
SUNSHINE ACROSS PARTS OF WALES FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND AGAIN HAZY 
SUNSHINE AT TIMES IF NOT YOU WILL 
HAVE BLUE SKIES THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE SUNSHINE 
AND A SMALL RISK OF A SHOWER THE 
HIGHEST CHANCE IS IN THE NORTH WEST 
BUT WE COULD CATCH ONE IN WALES 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE SOUTH WEST 
IF YOU ARE UNLUCKY THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY THE CLOUD WILL BURN BACK TO 
THE COAST BUT THE NORTH EAST OF 
ENGLAND COULD HANG ON TO IT FOR A 
TIME THROUGH THE NIGHT AGAIN WE 
WILL BE PLAYED BY THIS TROUBLESOME 
CLOUD COMING OFF THE NORTH SEA 
ACROSS SCOTLAND PUSHING STEADILY 
TOWARDS THE WEST AS FAR AS THE 
MIDLANDS NOT A PARTICULARLY COLD 
NIGHT WHERE THE CLOUD IS BROKEN 
OVERNIGHT IS WHERE WE WILL START 
WITH THE BLUE SKIES IN THE MORNING 
THE CLOUD WILL PUSH BACK TO THE 
COAST AGAIN BUT IT WILL BE SLOWER 
THAN TODAY THE TEMPERATURES ARE 
CLOSER TO WHAT WE EXPECT AT THIS 
TIME OF YEAR LATER ON IN THE DAY 
IN THE SOUTH WEST THE CLOUD WERE 
BUILT WE WILL SEE SHOWERS AND ON 
THURSDAY A REAL CHANGE RAIN 
COMING INTO THE SOUTH AND ON FRIDAY 
TEMPERATURES MUCH LOWER

FOR FOUR DECADES 
WHAT IS THE USE IN TRYING OR YOU

TRACE OF DOUBT IN MY MIND

THE TOP OF THE SHOGUNS WORLD HE

IN CHARGE HE IS QUITE SHY AND 
CLEARLY STILL WRITING FROM HEART 
SHOWBIZ WORLD 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THROWAWAY 
FASHION AND HAS BECOME A MAINSTAY 
OF BUYING OUR CLOTHES GETTING MORE 
FOR LESS HAS SEEN A LOW COST 
RETAILERS GET A HUGE PROFIT BUT 
THE SALES FIGURES OUT TODAY HAVE 
BEEN THE WORST FOR YEARS 
WE WENT TO BIRMINGHAM 
I NEVER LOOK AT THE PRICES I JUST 
BY WHAT I LIKE AND THAT IS SPEND 
SPEND SPEND 
I GO TO PRIMARK NOW 
BECAUSE I CANNOT AFFORD TO GO 
ANYWHERE ELSE 
I HAVE FOUND 
ESPECIALLY IN THE BIGGER SHOPS IN 
THE BULLRING PRICES ARE GOING UP 
SO I HAVE NOT BOUGHT CLOTHES FOR A 
WHILE 
I KNOW THEY HAVE GONE UP WHILE BUT I DON'T NOTICE OF THE 
DIFFERENCE NOT BIG ENOUGH TO SAY 
I AM NOT GOING TO SHOP THERE ANY 
MORE 
YOU HAVE TO GET WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT AND PUT MONEY WHERE YOU 
NEED TO PUT IT DON'T INDULGE IN 
THESE NEW SHOPS THE IF I LIKE WHAT 
I SEE I JUST BUY IT 
IT COMES DOWN 
TO WHETHER THEY HAVE THE KIND OF 
FASHION I LIKE 
WITH US NOW A RETAIL CONSULTANT 
RICHARD HYMAN AND T. V. PRESENTER AND 
STYLIST HANNA I WAS SHOCKED TO 
DISCOVER WHEN WE DID PROGRAMME 
ABOUT TEENAGERS GOING BACK TO INDIA 
TO SEE HOW ALL OF THESE CLOTHES ARE 
MADE IN SWEAT SHOPS SOME OF THEM 
BUY CLOTHES WERE THEM ONCE AND 
THEN THROW THEM AWAY PRESUMABLY 
AT THAT AGE IT MUST BE OVER 
IT HAS TO COME TO END END IN THE 
LAST TEN YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A 
FIELD DAY BUYING ALL THE CHEAP 
CLOTHES PUTTING THEM IN THE 
WARDROBE AND JUST WEARING THEM ONCE 
WHY BECAUSE THE CHEAP LABOUR 
ABROAD BECAUSE OF THE SUPERMARKETS 
SELLING CHEAP CLOTHES BUT IT DOES 
HAVE TO COME TO AN END BECAUSE OF 
OIL PRICES GOING UP FACTORIES MORE 
EXPENSIVE TO RUN SHIPPING IS MORE 
EXPENSIVE ONCE UPON A TIME WOMEN 
WOULD BE BUYING NINETEEN GARMENTS YEAR 
NOW WE ARE BUYING ON AVERAGE THIRTY FOUR 
WE CANNOT DO IT BECAUSE THE PRICE 
OF CLOTHES HAS TO GO UP BECAUSE 
RETAILERS CANNOT SELL THESE CLOSE 
FACTSHEET ANY MORE 
IS THAT THE 
CASE CLOTHES HAD BEEN TO CHEAT 
YOU STOLE MY THUNDER THAT IS 
BROADLY THE CASE THE RETAILER'S 
PROFIT MARGINS HAVE BEEN HIT VERY 
HARD BY NOT BEING ABLE TO RAISE 
THEIR PRICES THINK THE CRUNCH TIME HAS COME 
YOU CAN'T KEEP BUYING T. SHIRTS FOR 
TWO POINT FIVE OH YOU SEE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF 
PRIMARK WITH THE BAGS FULL HOW CAN 
THEY DO IT PEOPLE 
FOR 
MONEY VALUE IS ABOUT PRICE AND 
QUALITY AND THE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THE TWO L. THINK THE QUALITY BIT IN THAT 
EQUATION IS 
GOING TO 
BE GETTING BIGGER 
I AM A REAL PRIMARK ADDICT AND I'M 
ALSO A PRADA ADDICT AND I LIKE 
MISSIONING THE TWO AND TO BE 
HONEST I WOULD RATHER BUY ONE ONE 
ZILON OUTFITS IF YOU SCOUR THE 
SHOPS WELL YOU WILL FIND LOTS OF 
GOODIES GOODIES PEOPLE WANT VALUE YES THEY DO BUT 
WE WANT MEG MEGACHEAP PRICES 
WILL HAVE CHANGE THE 
WAY PEOPLE 
DRESS YES ARE WE GOING TO SEE DIFFERENCES IN 
FASHION 
NO YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FASHION SEE A BUNCH OF FRUMPY MRS. 
DOUBTFIRES THERE IS ONE WAY TO 
SOLVE THE SOLUTION IS GO TO SLICK 
CHARITY SHOPS IN WEALTHY AREAS AND 
PICK UP LOADS OF DESIGNER GOODIES 
FOR ROCK BOTTOM PRICES AND THINK 
ABOUT CUSTOMISING OLD CLOTHES 
DON'T CHUCK THEM OUT THINK ABOUT 
HOW YOU CAN REUSE THEM AND SWAP 
THEM MAYBE HAVE A 
IT ISN'T ABOUT GOING OUT AND 
SWAPPING SWAPPING I CAN IMAGINE MY MY SWAPPING I 
HAVE A TEN YEAR OLD PAIR OF JEANS 
ANYONE WANT TO SWAP RICHARD DO 
YOU SEE THAT RETAILERS ARE CUTTING 
THEIR PRICES ALREADY BECAUSE IT 
LOOKS AS THOUGH SOME OF THE SUMMER 
SALES 
OR 
IT IS THE END OF THE WINTER SALES I 
AM NOT SURE LOTS OF PEOPLE 
OFFERING FIFTY PER CENT 
A LOT WILL DEPEND ON 
HOW LONG THE GOOD WEATHER 
THE WEATHER 
HAS BEEN TERRIBLE IT 
HAS REALLY BEEN NOT ALLOWED 
RETAILERS TO SHIFT WHAT THEY WANT 
WHEN THEY WANT TO SHIFT IT THIS 
GOOD WEATHER HAS BOOSTED DEMAND FOR 
SPRING SLASH SUMMER ITEMS AND THEY NEED 
MORE OF IT 
ARE WE GOING TO SEE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THAT HIGH STREET STORES 
LINE UP 
ARE PEOPLE GOING TO GO OUT 
OF BUSINESS AS RESULT OF 
YES I 
THINK PEOPLE WILL BECAUSE AT THE 
END OF THE DAY WE ARE NOT GOING 
SEE PRICES 
GETTING CHEAPER WE WILL 
SEE THEM HALT THEY CAN'T GET ANY 
CHEAPER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO 
SELL THEIR CLOTHING FOR NOTHING 
THE OPTION IS EITHER THEY PUSH PRESSURE 
ON TO 
THE RECONSUMERS LIKE US OR WE HAVE 
TO PAY MORE OR THET OR THEY WILL GO 
BUST SO IT MEANS THE 
CLOTHING WILL GO UP SO THEY STAY 
AFLOAT AFLOAT YOU ARE QUITE INTERESTED IN HIS 
TEN YEAR OLD JEANS

THEM INTO A LOVELY MINI SKIRT I'M 
A DIVA ON THE THE SEWING MACHINE
