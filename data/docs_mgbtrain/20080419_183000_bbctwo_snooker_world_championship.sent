WHEN YOU FIRST WIN IT YOU THINK 
THAT WAS THE HARD PART BUT IT IS 
ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE 
THE HARD PART IS TRYING TO EMULATE 
THAT IT TOOK ME NINE YEARS 
THERE IS YOUNG PEERS HE WILL BE 
VERY PROUD OF HIS DAD INDEED 
FANTASTIC 
HELLO AGAIN A FULL YEAR HAS 
FLITTED BY SINCE JOHN HIGGINS WON 
THE EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD SNOOKER 
CHAMPIONSHIP HE WE ARE AGAIN 
COCOON IN THE INTERNET AND 
CLAUSTROPHOBIC ATMOSPHERE IN THE 
CRUCIBLE THEATRE JOHN IS 
ATTEMPTING TO BECOME THE FIRST MAN 
SINCE STEPHEN HENDRY TWELVE YEARS AGO 
TO RETAIN HIS BEAUTIFUL TROPHY 
MIND YOU AS HE WALKED INTO THE 
ARENA FOR HIS FIRST ROUND MATCH 
THIS MORNING HE KNEW HE WOULD HAVE 
IT OFF BECAUSE HE WAS UP AGAINST A 
FELLOW WHO HAS 
SO VERY 
NEARLY GOT 
HIS HANDS ON THIS SILVERWARE ON TWO 
OCCASIONS 
OCCASIONS WELSH MAN MATTHEW 
STEVENS THE REIGNING CHAMPION GOT 
THE TOURNAMENT UNDER WAY AT TEN A M. 
IT WAS NOT A PROMISING START FOR 
THE WIZARD OF WISHAW AS HE 
MAGICKED THIS BLACK IN AND LOST THE 
FIRST FRAME BUT HE CLEARED UP WITH 
THIS EIGHTY EIGHT BREAK IN THE SECOND FRAME 
TO LEVEL THE MATCH THE THIRD WAS 
ALL ABOUT OPPONENT MATTHEW STEVENS 
TRYING TO MAKE THIS CHAMPIONSHIPS 
FIRST MAXIMUM ALTHOUGH HE FLUKED 
THE PENULTIMATE BLACK THE RED 
PROVED IMPOSSIBLE MATTHEW'S GOOD 
LOOK SEEMED TO EVAPORATE AFTER THAT 
STEVENS FELL FIVE TWO BEHIND PAUL 
PLAY AND A BAD RUN COST HIM DEARLY 
HIGGINS WAS MARCHING ON ALMOST 
EFFORTLESSLY NOTHING FLASHY JUST 
SOLID PLAY MOVED HIM SIX TWO IN FRONT 
HE TOOK THE LAST AS WELL AT SEVEN TWO 
IN FRONT HIGGINS LOOKS TO HAVE AN 
ALMOST IMPREGNABLE LEAD GOING INTO 
TONIGHT'S SESSION JOHN PARROTT 
KNOWS WHAT IT IS LIKE TO TRY AND 
DEFEND THE TITLE THROUGH THOSE 
DOORS L. THINK YOU GOT TO THE 
QUARTERS DIDN'T YOU 
HE GOT ME A 
THIRTEEN TWELVE 
THAT WAS THE SAW ONE NOT NOT THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY DETAILS JOHN HIGGINS I WONDER IF THIS TOUGH 
DRAW AGAINST MATTHEW HAS 
CONCENTRATED HIS MIND SEVEN TWO UP 
AFTER THE FIRST SESSION THAT IS A 
SURPRISE 
YES BUT HE WAS LOOKING AT SURPRISE IT THE RIGHT WAY HE SAID THAT HE 
KNEW FROM BALL ONE HE HAD TO BE ON 
THE KNOCK HE HAD A GREAT RECORD AT 
THE CRUCIBLE AS WELL HE HAD TO BE 
AT WORK FROM THE FIRST BALL AND 
THAT IS WHAT HE DID 
JOHN'S WIFE IS 
DUE WITH BABY NUMBER THREE AT THE 
END OF MAY AND JOHN HAS SAID THAT 
IF HE OR SHE COMES EARLY HE IS OUT 
OF HERE 
HE MAKES DECISIONS HE HAS 
DONE IT BEFORE HE CAME OUT OF THE 
TOURNAMENT ONCE BEFORE FOR HIS 
BROTHER'S WEDDING AS WELL HE IS 
VERY 
MUCH A 
FAMILY MAN GOOD ON HIM 
THERE IN MIND THAT THESE GUYS HAVE 
NEVER PLAYED ONE ANOTHER SO EARLY 
AT THE CRUCIBLE THEY HAVE PLAYED QUARTER FINAL SEMI FINAL 
QUARTER FINAL A SEMI FINAL MATTHEW STEVENS HAS 
NEVER LOST 
AN 
OPEN ROUND MATCH AT THE CRUCIBLE 
HE HAS IT ALL TO DO TONIGHT JOHN 
HIGGINS CLEARLY COULD AFFORD TO BE 
A LITTLE MORE RELAXED WALKING INTO 
THE ARENA THIS EVENING HE IS GOING 
INTO TONIGHT'S SESSION WITH A 
HEALTHY LEAD SEVEN TWO IN FRONT THIS 
MATCH IS THE BEST OF NINETEEN FRAMES SO 
THE FIRST TO TEN WILL BECOME THE 
FIRST PLAYER TO ROUND TWO WE WILL 
JOIN THEM IN FRAME TEN COMMENTARY 
COMES FROM TERRY GRIFFITHS AND 
DENNIS TAYLOR AS FRESH AS DAISIES 
ON DAY ONE 
VERY WELL PLAYED MANAGED TO AVOID 
THE CANNON ON THE BROWN THE WRONG 
SIDE OF THE BLUE BUT IT WAS NOT 
EASY TO CONTROL THE CUE BALL HE 
CAN DROP THIS IN HEAVY CONTACT PINK AND BLACK A BIT HAMPERED HERE 
SQUEEZE THAT MORNING FOR THE NEAR 
CORNER HE IS LITTLE THIN ON THE BLUE BUT HE SHOULD BE O. K. 
PERFECT ANGLE ON THE BLUE HE HAS A 
CHOICE HERE A FEW LOOSE REDS HE 
COULD TRY TO DEVELOP THE PINK IF 
HE WANTS HE IS COMING TO SEE IF 
THE BLACK IS AVAILABLE PAST THE 
RED INTO THE CORNER POCKET A BIT 
RISKY PLAYING THE CANNON INTO THE 
PINK JOHN PREFERS TO PICK THEM OFF 
ONE BY ONE 
IS THAT BLACK AVAILABLE IS HE ON 
THE ANGLE ON THE RED TO DROP IT IN 
AND FINISH ON THE BLACK 
IT'S AMAZING TERRY THE NUMBER OF 
TIMES A PLAYER MISSES THE BLACK 
BECAUSE HE IS THINKING OF THE CUE 
BALL 
YES IT IS A BLIND POCKET AS BALL WE SAY HE CANNOT SEE THE POCKET 
ALONG THE LINE OF THE BLACK 
AN UNEXPECTED CHANCE FOR MATTHEW 
STEVENS HE NEEDS TO MAKE THE MOST 
OF HIS CHANCES IN THIS SESSION OF 
FOUR FRAMES 
HE SHOWED VERY GOOD FORM EARLY ON 
IN THIS MATCH BUT THEN HE WAS KEPT 
IN HIS CHAIR FOR LONG PERIODS AND 
LOST THREE CLOSE FRAMES HE HAS GOT 
TO WIN THOSE CLOSE ONES DENNIS I I DIDN'T SEE THE START OF THIS MATCH 
BUT I BELIEVE HE ALMOST MADE A 
MAXIMUM BREAK IN THE THIRD FRAME A 
TERRIFIC ONE HUNDRED AND WELL WITH THE 
CHANCE OF A MAXIMUM HE REALLY DOES 
PLAY VERY WELL AT THE CRUCIBLE HE 
WAS UNLUCKY THERE HE IS STUCK ON 
THE REDS HE DID NOT GET ENOUGH 
SPIN ON THE WHITE YOU DO NOT WANT 
TO HIT THAT FULL BALL AND HE DID 
THAT IT STUCK TO THE RED LIKE CLUE 
THAT IS THE SORT OF 
THING THAT 
HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE STRUGGLING 
WHEN EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL THAT 
ALWAYS WORKS OUT NICELY FOR YOU 
NOT EASY TO PLAY THE SAFETY SHOT 
HE COULD DROP ON THE RED ON THE 
BOTTOM CUSHION NOT SURE IF IT IS 
TOUCHING BALL IF IT IS TOUCHING 
BALL IT IS A LOT EASIER 
IT IS A TOUCHING BALL HE HAS GONE 
TO THE SIDE CUSHION BECAUSE THE RED 
TO THE RIGHT TO THE BLUE HE 
NORMALLY WOULD HAVE HEADED UP TO 
THE YELLOW BUT IT WAS TOO RISKY 
BECAUSE OF THAT RED 
THIS IS A MUST WIN FRAME FOR 
MATTHEW IT IS THE FIRST TO TEN BUT 
EIGHT TWO IS A REAL MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB 
JOHN HIGGINS LOOKED A LITTLE 
DISAPPOINTED HE DIDN'T GET BEHIND 
THE YELLOW BUT IT IS STILL GOOD SAFETY SHOT HE HAS GOT A CHANCE TO POT THIS A BIT UNLUCKY 
IF YOU PUT A SLIGHT BIT OF SIDE ON 
IT YOU CAN MISS THE POT LOOKS 
GOOD WELL PLAYED 
MATTHEW NEEDS SOME INSPIRATION NOW 
GOING FOR THAT PINK HE CAN GET 
THIS BREAK MOVING ALONG 
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU ARE A 
LONG WAY BEHIND AT THE CRUCIBLE 
SOMETIMES THINGS CAN PUT CLICK 
INTO PLACE YOU WIN A FEW FRAMES 
AND IT IS DIFFERENT ATTITUDE OUT 
THERE COMPLETELY ALL THE PRESSURE 
ON JOHN HIGGINS OF COURSE 
HE WILL BE GUARDING AGAINST LOSING 
A FEW FRAMES HE CANNOT DO ANYTHING 
AT THE MOMENT WHEN MATTHEW IS AT 
THE TABLE 
HE IS STRIKING THE BALL WELL 
LOOKING CONFIDENT OUT THERE 
HE KNOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING 
A GOOD START IN THIS SECOND SESSION 
HE WAS A BIT STRAIGHT ON THE PINK 
JUST NEEDS ONE MORE RED 
THIS IS JUST THE START BUT HE WAS 
LOOKING FOR THAT HE WAS LOOKING 
FOR 
A COUPLE OF THE FRAMES THIS MORNING 
COULD HAVE GONE MATTHEW'S WAY BUT 
DID NOT 
HE WILL NOT BE BOTHERED ABOUT THE 
BLACK 
MATTHEW STEVENS HAS A REAL PEDIGREE 
HERE TWICE THE RUNNER UP AND FIVE 
TIMES A SEMI FINALIST HE HAS GIVEN 
HIMSELF A CHANCE OF STAYING IN THIS 
MATCH BY TAKING THE OPENING FRAME 
A BIT OF LUCK WAS REQUIRED AND HE 
HAS NOT REALLY HAD IT THESE ARE 
TOUGH 
HE MAY HAVE TO GO FOR IT THE THE SECRET IN THE CRUCIBLE WHEN YOU'RE 
BEHIND IS TO PLAY YOUR NORMAL GAME 
BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO RESTRAIN 
YOURSELF 
HAVE YOU NEVER WON A MATCH HERE 
FROM A LONG WAY BEHIND DENNIS NOT NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF IT IS A GREAT 
PLACE TO PLAY WHEN YOU HAVE A TWO 
TABLE SITUATION IT IS SO TIGHT 
WHEN YOU GET TO A ONE TABLE 
SITUATION IT BECOMES A DIFFERENT 
ARENA 
MATTHEW STEVENS REALLY ENJOYS 
PLAYING HERE 
MATTHEW STEVENS HAD TO QUALIFY FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEAR 
HE DID NOT GET A GOOD CONTACT BUT 
HE IS STILL ON THE REDS 
HE SEEMED TO STRIKE THAT WELL AND 
JUST GLANCED OFF THE REDS RATHER 
THAN SPLITTING THEM OPEN THE RED 
INTO THE RIGHT CORNER IT IS TOUGH 
HE IS CERTAINLY TAKING IT ON I I THINK HE CAN GET BETWEEN THE RED 
AND THE BLACK 
IT IS DIFFICULT AT THE MOMENT HE 
CANNOT GET HIMSELF INTO PRIME 
POSITION BUT AS LONG PACE YOU KEEP 
POTTING THEM 
HE HAS ONE INTO THE RIGHT CENTRE 
AND IF HE HAS A GOOD ANGLE HE CAN 
STUN IT IN AND STAY ON THE BLACK 
MATTHEW LOOKS VERY COMFORTABLE OUT 
THERE 
HE CUED WELL IN THE FIRST SESSION 
BUT JOHN HIGGINS MADE THE MOST OF 
HIS CHANCES AFTER THE FIRST 
INTERVAL 
JOHN HIGGINS PLAYED BETTER BUT I 
WOULD NOT SAY HE PLAYED FIVE FRAMES 
BETTER MIND YOU I AM BIASED 
BECAUSE 
I AM WELSH I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE WELSH TERRY 
DID IT TO DRIFT A LITTLE BIT 
NORMALLY THEY TURNED IN BUT THAT 
APPEARED TO GO STRAIGHT MATTHEW'S MATTHEW'S REACTION SAYS THAT IT WENT UP 
MOVED TO THE RIGHT 
HE WAS TAKING A CHANCE HE WAS 
GOING TO CANNON INTO THE PINK BUT 
HE WAS FORTUNATE TO KEEP IT SAFE 
MATTHEW HAS A RED TO GO FOUR IN THE 
RIGHT CORNER PUT IT IS A TOUGH ONE 
BUT IT IS A TOUGH ONE 
IT IS AWKWARD BECAUSE OF WHERE THE 
CUE BALL IS PLACED AWKWARD 
BRIDGING 
THAT WAS A BETTER CHOICE 
THE ONLY 
DANGER IT WAS IT THE RED WOBBLED 
AND WENT ON TO ANOTHER POCKET 
HE ALMOST GOT THE DOUBLE KISS THEM 
A GOOD SHOT EIGHT DOUBLE KISS THEN 
IT IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE 
YOU WANT ONE OR TWO BALLS ON THE 
CUSHIONS BUT THEY ARE ALL IN PLAY 
AT THE MOMENT 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF NOISE FROM THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE ARENA WITH 
PLAYERS IN BETWEEN FRAMES BUT THAT 
IS SOMETHING HE LEARNED TO COPE 
WITH AT THE CRUCIBLE 
HE PLAYED IT TOWARDS THE THICKER 
SIDE OF THE POCKET SO THAT THE RED 
CAME OFF THE CUSHION HE MISSED IT BY A LONG WAY 
IT IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR TRON 
HIGGINS' TO MISS A LONG POT BY THAT 
BUT FOUR JOHN HIGGINS HE DID WELL TO HOLD THAT 
IT LOOKS TO BE A VERY LIVELY CLOTH 
THE PLAYERS I HAVE SPOKEN TO SAID 
IT IS NICE A FEW KICKS HERE AND 
THERE BUT THEY HAVE TO GET USED TO 
THOSE IT IS QUICK BUT NOT ON 
CONTROLLABLE THAT IS EXACTLY HOW 
THE PLAYERS LIKE IT 
THE CUE BALL SEEMS TO KEEP ON 
RUNNING 
BEAUTIFUL WHEN YOU ARE ON STROKE 
BUT IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING IT CAN 
CATCH YOU OUT 
THAT WAS NARROW ON THE BROWN THAT 
DOES NOT REALLY MATTER MATTHEW 
STEVENS CONTINUES HIS COMEBACK HE 
IS NOW JUST TRAILING SEVEN FOUR 
THERE IS A DIFFERENT AGENDA AT 
STAKE FOR MATTHEW STEVENS BECAUSE 
LIKE JOHN PARROTT HE IS SPENDING 
SOME TIME OUTSIDE THE TOP SIXTEEN 
QUALIFYING WHICH WAS SHOCK FOR 
MATTHEW LAST YEAR WHEN HE DROPPED 
OUTSIDE THE TOP SIXTEEN EVEN IF HE WINS 
THIS MATCH HE IS NOT GUARANTEED TO 
GET BACK IN 
THERE IS 
SO MUCH TO 
ING 
AND FRO ING MANY PERMUTATIONS HEAD WOULD HURT 
IF I 
STARTED 
TALKING ABOUT THEM PROVISIONAL 
LISTS AND PROVISIONAL THAT WE LET 
THE TOURNAMENT TAKE CARE OF ITSELF 
MATTHEW STEVENS 
KNOWS HE HAS 
COME OUT OF THE 
BLOCKS VERY 
QUICKLY 
HE HAS TO WIN THIS SESSION AT LEAST 
THREE 
ONE 
TO GIVE HIMSELF 
THE CHANCE 
IN 
THE MATCH A 
HIS FOCUS 
SEEMS SHARP 
THE MATCH TONIGHT 
IT NEEDS 
TO BE 
HIS AGENDA 
TONIGHT IS WRITTEN FOR 
HIM SO 
HE IS FULLY 
FOCUSED AND 
HE HAS GOT 
TO BE 
BOTH 
BOTH JOHN AND 
MATTHEW KNOW 
WHAT THEY 
FACE SHOULD 
THEY GET 
THROUGH THIS 
OPENING ROUND MATCH AND THAT IS 
RYAN DAY LET'S REMIND YOU OF THE 
REST OF THE DRAW IN THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP RYAN DAY IS BOUNDING

COULD BE VERY HOT TO HANDLE THE 
VETERAN STEVE DAVIS THAT IS POLITE 
FOR THE OLDEST TAKES ON BINGHAM 
WE ARE VERY PLEASED THAT FORMER 
CHAMPION GRAEME DOTT IS WITH US IN 
SHEFFIELD HE HAS BEEN 
FROM HEALTH RECENTLY 
BUT HE 
WILL BE FACING JOE PERRY IN ROUND 
ONE ONE WE ARE GOING STRAIGHT BACK 
INTO THE 
ARENA LIVE TO THE FIRST MATCH 
BETWEEN JOHN HIGGINS AND MATTHEW 
STEVENS STEVENS HAS THE ADVANTAGE 
IN THIS TWELVE T. H. FRAME HE IS MAKING A 
BIT OF A COMEBACK WILL HAND YOU 
BACK TO TERRY AND DENNIS 
LOOK HOW 
CLOSE THE WHITE IS TO THE CUSHION 
WHAT ABOUT THAT FOR A POT HE IS 
NOT SAFE YET IN THE FRAME HE HAS THE CORRECT ANGLE 
ON THE 
BROWN TO DROP IN BEHIND THE 
DIFFICULT RED THE RED THAT HE WILL 
NEED TO KEEP THIS COME BACK ON 
TRACK AND TO GIVE HIM THE FIRST 
THREE FRAMES AS JOHN PARROTT SAID 
IN THE STUDIO HE HAS TO GET AT 
LEAST THREE FRAMES OUT OF THIS 
SESSION IF NOT FOR BUT HE IS ON 
HIS WAY THE WELSHMAN 
HE HAS PUSHED THE GREEN SAFE 
DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO ENTERTAIN 
GETTING ONTO THE RED JOHN HIGGINS PLAYED THAT ONE WELL 
WE HAD A COUPLE OF INCIDENTS IN 
THIS FRAME WATCH THE WHITE JOHN 
IN AMONGST THE BALLS LOOK AT THE 
BOUNCE ON THE CUSHION JOHN STOPS 
IN HIS TRACKS HE CANNOT BELIEVE IT 
THAT IS WHERE IT WOULD HAVE 
FINISHED WITHOUT THE BAD BOUNCE 
THAT WAS A TRICKY ONE WHERE WILL 
IT FINISH 
TALKING 
ABOUT BAD BOUNCES WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE THE SAME THING FOR 
MATTHEW HE THOUGHT HE WAS ON THE 
BLACK AND LOOK WHERE IT'S FINISHED 
THE SAYING CUSHION SAYING CUSHION 
THEY DO YOUR HEAD IN YOU LOOK LIKE 
A RIGHT MORGUE MUG 
HE WILL HAVE A GO AT THIS IT IS A 
VERY DIFFICULT POT BECAUSE OF THE 
SITUATION WITH THE CUE BALL THE 
WHITE WILL COME INTO THIS CORNER 
PAST THE YELLOW BUT IF THE RED 
GOES 
IN LOOK 
AT THE BLUE PINK AND 
GOES IN LOOK AT THE BLUE PINK AND BLACK 
MATTHEW CAN AFFORD TO HAVE A GO AT 
THIS AS WELL THIS IS SLIGHTLY 
EASIER THAN JOHN'S THERE IS A 
SIMILAR SCENARIO THE WHITE WILL BE 
COMING ROUND TOWARDS THE PINK AND 
THE BLACK HERE 
MATTHEW ONLY NEEDS THE RED HE 
DIDN'T MAKE IT 
I'M NOT SURE IF HE HAD A BAD 
CONTACT IF NOT THAT WAS POOR SAFETY SHOT 
JOHN HIGGINS CANNOT POT A BALL AT 
THE MOMENT ONCE AGAIN HE HAS BEEN 
A LITTLE BIT FORTUNATE ALTHOUGH HE 
COULD BE SNOOKERED BEHIND THE BLACK 
HE WILL DEFINITELY BE SNOOKERED 
BEHIND THE BLACK UNSURPRISED THE 
WAY JOHN PLAYED THAT LAST POT HE 
WAS TRYING TO HOLD THE CUE BALL BUT 
IT MAKES THE POT MUCH MORE 
DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE PINK IS 
CLOSE TO THE POCKET HE 
COULD HAVE 
PLAYED IT WITH MORE PACE BUT WHEN 
YOU ARE 
STRUGGLING OUT 
DENNIS YOU DON'T ALWAYS MAKE THE 
RIGHT DECISIONS 
IT LOOKS LIKE A 
FREE BALL AS WELL HE HAS GOT THE 
BLUE BALL ON SO IT LOOKS LIKE END 
OF FRAME AND THE COMEBACK CONTINUES 
YES BUT WHAT A DIFFERENT FRAME 
THIS HAS BEEN IT HAS HAD A BIT OF 
EVERYTHING IN IT MISSES BOUNCES 
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING APART FROM 
HIGH BREAKS 
THIS MORNING IT WAS JOHN HIGGINS 
WHO WON ALL THE CLOSE SCRAPPY 
FRAMES MATTHEW STEVENS LOOKS LIKE 
HE WILL WIN THIS ONE 
THE COMEBACK CONTINUES MATTHEW 
STEVENS HAS PLAYED THREE FRAMES 
THIS EVENING HE HAS WON ALL TWO 
BEHIND ALL THREE FRAMES THIS SEASON AND NOW HE IS TWO BEHIND 
MY SNOOKER HERO GROWING UP WAS 
JIMMY WHITE AND TERRY GRIFFITHS 
BECAUSE HE WAS WELSH AND I USED TO 
PLAY IN HIS CLUB AS A JUNIOR JIMMY 
WHITE BECAUSE I LIKED THE WAY HE 
PLAYED AND HE LOST 
A FEW 
FINALS L. 
THINK HE WAS EVERYONE'S HERO ALWAYS NICE TO 
PLAY WELL 
BUT I GET 
MORE SACKS SATISFACTION BY 
PLAYING BADLY AND WINNING 
YOU NEVER RULE THIS MAN OUT 
ESPECIALLY AT THE CRUCIBLE JOHN 
WHAT HAVE YOU DETECTED ABOUT 
HIGGINS DEMEANOUR IT TONIGHT 
HE IS 
NOT QUITE AS COMFORTABLE THAT IS 
BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE THAT 
MATTHEW IS PUTTING HIM UNDER HE 
SEEMED TO 
BE STRIKING 
THE BALL 
BETTER WHEN MATTHEW HIT THE BALL 
WELL YOU CAN TELL AND THAT HAS AN 
ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR OPPONENT AT 
THE MOMENT HIGGINS IS STRUGGLING 
WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING THROUGH THE 
STATISTICS AND BOTH OF 
THESE MEN 
HAVE SUFFERED 
SOME REALLY 
BAD 
DEFEAT HAVING BEEN VERY FAR IN 
FRONT LAST YEAR IN THE 
FINAL JOHN 
HIGGINS WAS SO 
FAR IN 
FRONT OF MARK 
SELBY AND 
HAD TO REALLY COME 
THROUGH THAT NERVOUS TIME YOU DO 
TWITCHED OUT THERE IT 
IS ONLY 
NATURAL YES 
BUT THE 
NATURE OF THE 
GAME THERE 
IS ONE 
CUE BALL IT IS 
NOT 
LIKE GOLF 
YOU HAVE 
YOUR OWN 
BALL IF SOMEONE 
HAS THE 
CUE BALL 
AND 
YOU ARE 
SITTING IN YOUR CHAIR 
ALL OF YOU CAN DO IS 
WATCH SEVEN 
TWO 
LOOKS VERY COMFORTABLE 
IT LOOKS 
LIKE YOU MIGHT 
BE GOING 
OUT EARLY FOR DINNER THIS EVENING 
ALL THE SUDDEN SEVEN FIVE YOU START 
LOOKING IN 
THE REAR VIEW 
MIRROR AND 
IT PAID 
CHANGES THE 
WHOLE ASPECT 
OF THE GAME 
ALL THE 
SUDDEN YOU ARE 
A BIT 
TIGHT A 
BIT TENSE 
AND THE 
CHANCE THAT 
COMES ALONG MEANS 
THAN I DID BEFORE 
HAD YOU KEEP 
YOURSELF CAN'T 
AS TERRY SAID IN 
COMMENTARY YOU 
HAVE GOT 
TO PLAY IT 
AS IF 
IT IS THE 
FIRST GAME 
OF THE 
MATCH IT 
IS VERY 
DIFFICULT TO 
DO 
JUST 
TRY TO 
KEEP THE SAME 
ON THE MATCH 
BUT IT 
IS DIFFICULT 
ON THE MATCH BUT IT IS DIFFICULT WHEN 
YOU SEE 
AS THE DEFENDING 
CHAMPION HOW 
MUCH 
MORE PRESSURE 
DO YOU 
FEEL UNDER 
EVERY PLAYER 
WANTS TO GET 
THE FIRST ROUND THE FIRST ROUND IS 
HORRIBLE AND AS DEFENDING CHAMPION THERE 
MUST BE 
SOME ADDED TO IT 
FEW DAYS OFF AFTER 
THAT AND 
YOU CAN 
LOOK FORWARD 
TO YOUR 
NEXT MATCH 
BUT HE IS 
IN A 
TOUGH ONE AT 
MOMENT 
AND THIS IS A VERY MOMENT IMPORTANT FRAME 
THEY ARE ALL IMPORTANT IN THE 
CRUCIBLE FROM FIRST TO LAST THE 
BEST FRAME TO WIN ALWAYS IS THE 
LAST ONE IS THAT RIGHT DENNIS 
YES AND I SUPPOSE OVER THE YEARS 
THERE ARE NOT THAT MANY PLAYERS WHO 
OF WON THE LAST FRAME AT THE 
CRUCIBLE THEATRE THERE ARE TWENTY ONE 
FORMER WORLD CHAMPIONS IT IS AN 
EXCLUSIVE CLUB TO BECOME A MEMBER 
OF IT WAS NOT THE BEST BREAK OFF 
SHOT FROM MATTHEW BUT IT HAS WORKED 
TO HIS ADVANTAGE 
HOW MANY WINNERS 
HAVE THERE BEEN IN THE CRUCIBLE 
DENNIS DO YOU KNOW THAT 
YOU HAVE 
GOT TO LAST ME ONE ON TO SPORT 
TERRY ASK ME 
SEVENTEEN IT IS ONLY 
BECAUSE MARK ALLEN TOLD ME LAST 
NIGHT L. WOULD NEVER HAVE SAID SEVENTEENTH 
AT THE CRUCIBLE 
WHAT YEAR DID YOU 
WIN IT TERRY 
I CAN'T RECALL THAT 
NOW IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YEAR 
YOU WIN IT 
THAT IS THE FIRST BAD 
SHOT THAT MATTHEW HAS PLAYED ALL 
EVENING HE PUT A BIT OF RIGHT HAND 
SIDE ON THAT AND THAT IS WHY HE 
MISSED THE RED BY SO MUCH THAT BE THE 
CHANCE JOHN 
HIGGINS HAS 
BEEN WAITING FOR 
THIS IS THE KEY FRAME BECAUSE IF 
JOHN HIGGINS CAN TAKE IT EIGHT FIVE 
HE REALLY WILL ENJOY THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL IF HE IS ONLY ONE 
AHEAD IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR HIM 
HE WILL STILL BE FAVOURITE ABSOLUTELY 
BECAUSE THE BREAK WOULD ABSOLUTELY COME AT A GOOD TIME 
BUT SEVEN SIX 
AFTER BEING SEVEN TWO IN FRONT 
LOOK AT 
WHAT HE DID LAST YEAR AGAINST MARK 
SELBY IN THE FINAL WAS HE TWELVE FOUR 
IN FRONT HE LOST THE LEAGUE ARE 
ONE FRAME AND THEN WON THE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS A GREAT PERFORMANCE 
THAT 
I CANNOT REMEMBER HIM BEING ON THE 
BLACK THIS EVENING AND AMONGST THE 
REDS 
SOMETIMES IT CAN GO LIKE THAT REDS IN A SESSION 
SHAUN TEND TO PICK THEM OFF RATHER 
THAN GO INTO THAT BUNCH JOHN IT 
TENDS TO PICK THEM OFF 
HE HAD ANOTHER ANGLE THERE TO GO 
INTO THE BUNCH BUT THERE IS 
ANOTHER LOOSE RED 
HE NEEDS TO KEEP THINGS EASY FOR A 
LITTLE WHILE TO GET SOME CONFIDENCE 
THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD EFFORT FROM 
WHERE HE WAS SITUATED 
I DO NOT THINK HE HAS GOT THE 
CORRECT ANGLE HERE TOO STRAIGHT ON 
THE GREEN THIS IS TYPICAL OF JOHN HIGGINS 
EVERY SHOT IS TOUGH OUT THERE FOR 
HIM 
IS MAKING THEM 
BUT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN COURAGEOUS PLAYER 
HE TENDS TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE WHEN 
HE IS BEHIND 
HE IS NOT NICELY ON A RED BUT HE 
HAS STOPPED THE ROT BY THE LOOKS 
OF THINGS HE ONLY NEEDED THE ONE 
CHANCE 
MATTHEW IS COMING TO THE TABLE BUT 
BARRING HER SNOOKER JOHN HIGGINS 
WILL GO TO THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL EIGHT TO FIVE AHEAD 
MATTHEW NEEDS TWO FOUR POINT IT 
SNOOKERS IN ORDER TO TIE FRAME CONCEDED 
THE DEFENDING CHAMPION PETER TWO 
MORE FRAMES TO BE THE FIRST MAN 
THROUGH TO ROUND TWO 
THAT IS WHY 
HE IS A CHAMPION ALL YOU NEED IS 
ONE GOOD CHANCE AND THAT IS EXACTLY 
WHAT HE HAS DONE HE LOST THREE 
FRAMES VERY QUICKLY AND TO MAKE 
THAT AS A RESPONSE THAT IS WHY HE 
HAS BEEN A CHAMPION OVER THE YEARS 
THREE TO ONE IN THE MINI SESSION BEFORE THAT 
INTERVAL WHAT DID THE GAME PLAN 
NOW 
WHEN YOU WIN THE FIRST THREE NOW ANY DO NOT QUITE WHEN THE LAST ONE 
IT TAKES A BIT OF GLOSS FROM IT 
JOHN HIGGINS HAS AN NICE REFRAIN 
CAT AND IT FULL HAS COME UP THE 
RIGHT TIME IT HAS BEEN AN 
INTRIGUING MATCH 
WE THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE A BIT ANTI CLIMACTIC BUT 
IT HAS DEVELOPED NICELY TONIGHT 
MATTHEW CAN STRUGGLE BUT WHEN HE 
COMES HERE AND PLACE IN THE U. K. HE 
FINDS ANOTHER LEVEL OF FORM THEY THEY WILL ENJOY THEIR HALF TIME CUP OF 
TEA WE WILL GIVE YOU A TASTER OF 
THE EVENT ON TABLE TWO BARRY 
HAWKINS TAKING ON ALI CARTER THEY 
ARE FRIENDS AND FROM BROCCOLI THE 
SAME PART OF THE 
THE HOME 
SAME PART OF THE WORLD IN THE HOME COUNTIES WE WILL JOIN IT IN THE 
BUSINESS END OF FRAME THREE 
ROUGHLY THE SAME PART OF THE WORLD 
WHAT A CHANCE MISSED FOR HAWKINS 
ALL I CAN THINK IS THAT HE MISSED 
THAT BECAUSE HE WAS CONCERNING 
HIMSELF WITH THE POSITION OF THE 
CUE BALL 
BUT FOR THAT MISTAKE FROM HAWKINS 
HE MIGHT WELL HAVE GONE ON TO LEAD 
THREE TO ZERO BUT CARTER IT NOW NEEDS THEN 
THE RED AND BLACK TO REDUCE HIS 
ARREARS TO TWO TO ONE 
IT WAS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD TO GET 
ON TO COLOUR FROM BUT HE PLAYED 
THAT QUITE SENSIBLY ON TO 
COLOUR FROM THAT HE GOT A KICK AND 
IT HAS NOT REACHED 
HAWKINS HAS 
BEEN VERY UNLUCKY TWICE WITH KICKS 
THAT TIME CARTER WAS UNLUCKY IT IT DID NOT SOUND RIGHT AND THAT 
STOPPED THE ON THE BLACK 
THERE WAS ALWAYS A GOOD CHANCE OF 
PLAYING A TACTICAL SNOOKER WITH SO 
MANY COLOURS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
TABLE 
HE HAS LOST HIS COMPOSURE A LITTLE 
BIT I THINK HE WILL NOT SETTLE 
AND TOLD HE WINS THE FRAME UNTIL 
HE WINS A FRAME 
IF BARRY HAWKINS CLEARS UP HERE 
THIS WILL HURT 
CARTER HAD AN UNTIMELY KICK AND 
WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FRAME BALL 
BLACK HAWKINS CLEARED WITH THIRTY THREE 
THE LAST FRAME BEFORE THE INTERVAL 
WAS EQUALLY TIGHT THIS IS A VERY 
INTERESTING MATCH UP BECAUSE 
MEMORIES OF THE LAST TIME THAT THEY 
PLAYED WILL BE FRESH 
IT WAS IN 
DEBT U. K. IT WAS EIGHT TO TWENTY FOUR ALI CARTER AND 
HE 
GOT BEATEN 
NINE TO EIGHT BY A HAWKINS YOU 
DO REMEMBERED THOSE MATCHES AND AND THEY HURT AS WELL 
BUT TODAY IS 
ANOTHER DAY 
WE WILL SEE THAT ONE A 
LITTLE BIT LATER COVERAGE 
CONTINUES VIA THE RED BUTTON ON AT 
INTERACTIVE SERVICE WE WILL BE 
BACK HERE WAY AFTER THE MIDNIGHT 
HOUR ON B. B. C. TWO
