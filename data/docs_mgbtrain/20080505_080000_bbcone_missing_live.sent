OF SOFTWARE AND THE CAMERA WILL 
CAPTURE THE NUMBER PLATE AND IT 
WILL FEED THAT IMAGE INTO THE

NUMBER PLATE WITH DATABASES WHICH 
MAY RUN INTO MULTIMILLIONS OF 
NUMBER PLATES AND IT WILL GIVE THE 
OPERATOR A RESULT INSTANTANEOUSLY 
WE CAN TRAVEL DOWN THIS ROAD AND WE 
HAVE A LOT OF TRAFFIC TRAVELLING 
TOWARDS US AND THE SYSTEM WILL 
CAPTURE ALL THESE NUMBER PLATES IF 
IT ALARMS WILL GIVE AN AUDIBLE 
ALARM THE OFFICER CAN LOOK AT THE 
SCREEN SEE WHAT THE MESSAGE IS 
TELLING HIM AND MAKE THE DECISION 
WHETHER TO GO AND STOP THE VEHICLE 
IF THE POLICE HAVE INFORMATION THAT 
A VEHICLE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN AN 
ABDUCTION OR WHERE A MISSING PERSON
