IT'S BEEN OVER EIGHT YEARS SINCE BIANCA'S TEARFUL GOODBYE FROM ALBERT SQUARE 
AND RICKY HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN HIS GREASY OVERALLS FOR A WHILE 
BUT WALFORD IS IN FOR A BIT OF TROUBLE AND STRIFE BECAUSE RICKY AND BIANCA ARE COMING HOME 
AH 
NOW WILL YOU GET LOST 
FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS THEY HAD ONE OF THE ROCKIEST RELATIONSHIPS IN ALBERT SQUARE 
RICKY THEY'VE SURVIVED NUMEROUS AFFAIRS AND HEARTBREAK WHEN THEY LOST THEIR BABY 
BUT BIANCA HAD ONE FUMBLE TOO MANY AND RICKY SENT HER PACKING 
OH

AND HEARTACHE 
AH 
FOR PATSY AND SID TO BE COMING BACK IN THE SHOW 
WHILE I'M STILL HERE

IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT HAVING THEM BACK 
I THINK VIEWERS WANT TO KNOW WHERE THEY'VE BEEN 
THERE'S ALWAYS A THING OF 
I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM LIKE IN REAL LIFE 
THEY'VE BEEN GONE A LONG TIME 
AND SO MUCH IS GONNA HAVE HAPPENED IN THEIR LIVES 
ARE THEY GOING TO GET BACK TOGETHER

IT WILL BE REALLY GOOD TO SEE THEM REUNITED AND SEE WHAT TRANSPIRES 
I THINK IT'LL BE TERRIFIC 
I WON'T WANNA WORK I'LL JUST BE WANTING TO WATCH THEIR SCENES 
ON LOCATION IN NORTH WATFORD SID OWEN AND PATSY PALMER 
GET TO REPRISE THEIR ROLES AS RICKY AND BIANCA

O. K. IT'S ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIX SCENE ELEVEN FIRST PASS TAKE ONE 
TODAY'S OUR FIRST DAY SO UM YEAH 
BUT WE DID MEET UP THE OTHER DAY AND WENT OVER SOME LINES DIDN'T WE HMM 
WE LIVE ROUND THE CORNER TO EACH OTHER IT'S JUST THE SAME REALLY IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME IT IS 
SHE KEEPS GETTING THE GIGGLES SO NOTHING'S CHANGED THERE 
I NEED THE EARPLUGS FOR THE OLD SCREECH OF RICKY I KNOW IT'S GOT LOUDER IT HAS 
I THINK SHE'S BEEN REHEARSING 
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SAID IT SINCE I'VE LEFT COS EVERYBODY SAYS WILL YOU SAY IT WILL YOU SAY IT 
OH NO SORRY I CAN'T SAY IT I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM 
SO THE SCENE TODAY I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TRACK HER DOWN COS I WANT TO TAKE MY SON TO THE FUNERAL

HIYA WHY HAVEN'T YOU BEEN ANSWERING YOUR PHONE MY BATTERY'S DEAD 
I ONLY REALISED THIS MORNING LIAM MISSED HIS GRANDDAD'S FUNERAL I KNOW SORRY SORRY 
IT'D ONLY HAVE MEANT ONE DAY OFF SCHOOL SCHOOL'S IMPORTANT AND MY DAD'S FUNERAL AIN'T 
THE STORY BEHIND IT REALLY IS THAT I'VE BEEN HOMELESS 
AND I'VE GOT NO MONEY SHE'S ON THE STREET AND I'VE COME TO MEET RICKY TO TRY AND GET SOME MONEY 
COS I'M ON THE STREETS WITH MY FOUR KIDS 
SO I'VE COME HERE TO TRY AND GET SOME MONEY BUT I DON'T MANAGE TO ASK HIM

AND ACTION 
LOOK WHY DON'T I RING PAT AND SEE IF SHE DON'T MIND US HANGING ON FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS EH 
JUST GOT TO GO TOILET 
HELLO PAT LISTEN I'VE GOT A FAVOUR TO ASK 
NEVER TRUST A GING OR A BRUNETTE IT'S A WELL KNOWN FACT 
I'M A REAL WILD ONE WILD ONE WILD ONE 
FOR BIANCA IT WASN'T ALWAYS TRUDGING AROUND THE STREETS WITH FOUR KIDS IN TOW 
WHEN SHE FIRST ARRIVED IN WALFORD HER BLAZING PASSION 
AND HER FIERY TEMPER SOON SENT SPARKS FLYING IN ALBERT SQUARE 
WELL I'M JUST OUTTA SCHOOL LIKE I'M REAL REAL COOL 
GOTTA DANCE LIKE A FOOL 
GOT THE MESSAGE THAT I GOTTA BE A WILD ONE 
GONNA KEEP IT SWINGING BABY I'M A REAL WILD CHILD 
BIANCA'S A FORCE OF NATURE I THINK REALLY SHE'S A WHIRLING DERVISH 
THIS WILD GIRL WITH A VOICE THAT COULD FRANKLY GRATE CHEESE 
RICKY RICKY RICKY RICKY 
RICKY RICKY 
RICKY Y. Y. 
RICKY Y. Y. Y. 
I MEAN THAT'S GOTTA TO BE THE ULTIMATE EASTENDERS' CATCHPHRASE 
RICKY 
GOD GAVE US A WARNING DEVICE 
HE GAVE HER RED HAIR WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP FOR WITH BIANCA 
YOU ARE A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME 
BIANCA IS A COMPLETE AND UTTER FRUITCAKE 
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING OFF I'M RUNNING HOME WHY HAVE YOU GOT THE HUMP I HAVEN'T I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME 
SHE'S A LIVE WIRE 
SHE'S JUST A GREAT CHARACTER 
SHE'S SO COLOURFUL AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT 
ANYWAY THEY'VE BEEN GOOD TO US PUTTING US UP WE'RE PAYING FOR IT NOW THOUGH AIN'T WE 
WHAT'S THE MATTER 
MOUTHY MOUTHY 
WHY DON'T YOU STICK A SANDWICH IN HER MOUTH EH SHUT HER UP 
OR BETTER STILL TRY A WHOLE LOAF 
NOTHING LIKE A GOOD DEBATE TO CLEAR THE AIR 
BIANCA IS A BIT KIND OF NUTS AND LOUD AND IN YOUR FACE 
JUST TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME YOU'RE AS BAD AS HE IS GET STUFFED BOTH OF YOU 
BIANCA I THINK JUST EVERY GIRL JUST ADORED HER CHARACTER 
SHE'S JUST SO FEISTY AND BRAZEN 
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM I AIN'T GOT ONE GET ME A VODKA AND TONIC AND A LAGER FOR ME BOYFRIEND 
COMING RIGHT UP 
IF SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE PULLED UP OR TOLD THAT THEY'VE BEEN OUT OF ORDER 
THEN AGAIN SHE'S THE PERSON FOR THE JOB 
REMIND ME WHICH MAGAZINE COVERS YOU FEATURED ON LATELY 
LISTEN FRECKLE FACE I LIKE MY FRECKLES HOW DO YOU LIKE BEING A FAILURE 
I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE HOW RUDE SHE IS 
AND I WAS A BIT OH SHE'S SO RUDE WAS SHE ALWAYS THIS RUDE 
AND EVERYBODY'S LIKE YEAH OF COURSE SHE WAS 
BIANCA WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A COW TO BE HONEST 
SHE WAS A BIT OF A BULLY 
AND SHE WAS A LITTLE BIT ABOVE HER STATION I THINK SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS BETTER THAN SHE WAS 
IF I EVER CATCH YOU NEAR MY HUSBAND AGAIN YOU'LL REGRET IT I DON'T NEED THIS 
TOUGH COS I AIN'T GONNA STOP BOTHERING YOU UNTIL YOU'RE OUT OF IT 
APART FROM SHOUTING AT EVERYONE BIANCA'S OTHER HOBBY WAS MEN ESPECIALLY OLDER ONES 
AND SHE GOT THE SHOCK OF HER LIFE WHEN SHE WENT FOR THE WRONG MAN 
MIND YOU SOME SAY HE WAS VERY HANDSOME 
DO YOU OFTEN BADGER BLOKES YOU HARDLY KNOW TO BUY YOU A DRINK ONLY GOOD LOOKING ONES 
BIANCA WAS ALWAYS YOU KNOW NOT AFRAID TO GO AFTER THE OLDER MAN 
PROBABLY PARTLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN HER FATHER 
AND SHE TRIED IT ON WITH DAVID WICKS 
DAVID WICKS CAME INTO THE STORYLINE AS HER FATHER 
BUT SHE DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE WAS HER DAD 
SO HE CAME IN THIS GORGEOUSLY HANDSOME MAN 
AND BIANCA DEVELOPED A CRUSH ON HIM 
BIANCA DID TRULY THINK THAT NO MAN COULD RESIST HER 
SO YES WHEN OLD WICKS TAKES HER IN AND HE'S RESCUED HER 
AND TAKEN HER IN FROM SOME EVIL MAN WHO'S TRIED TO ATTACK HER 
LEAVE HER ALONE LOOK MATE SHE'S HAD A FEW TOO MANY 
I NEED TO SEE SHE GETS HOME SAFELY I SAID LEAVE HER ALONE PUSH OFF I SAID LEAVE HER ALONE 
SHE ASSUMES THAT THIS IS THE MOMENT WHEN SHE FALLS INTO HIS ARMS AND SEDUCES HIM 
SHE'S LOOKING FOR THE FATHER FIGURE TRIES TO GIVE HIM THE BIG SNOG IN THE CAR SHOWROOM REALLY CLASSY 
KISS ME 
SHE PRETTY MUCH PUT IT ON A PLATE FOR HIM AND IT WAS KIND OF A REALLY HARD SCENE TO WATCH 
I WANT YOU 
YOU WANT ME AS WELL DON'T YOU 
IT'S A CRINGE NO WE COULDN'T BELIEVE WE WERE WATCHING THIS 
BIANCA PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ME BIANCA STOP IT STOP IT 
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD ARE YOU TRYING TO DRIVE ME INSANE 
THE MORE HE TRIED TO PUSH HER AWAY THE MORE SHE CAME ON TO HIM IN THE END HE BLURTED IT OUT 
I'M YOUR FATHER IN COMPLETE EASTENDERS' STYLE 
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM I'M YOUR FATHER ALL RIGHT 
BUT THE CAREFREE WILD CHILD OF YESTERDAY HAS BEEN REPLACED TODAY 
WITH THE WAR TORN AND DOWNTRODDEN SINGLE MUM OF FOUR 
BIANCA HAS DONE WHAT SHE ALWAYS WANTED TO AVOID 
REPEATING THE MISTAKES THAT HER MOTHER CAROL HAD MADE 
BIANCA'S STILL THE SAME BIANCA IN A WAY 
STILL SPEAKS BEFORE SHE THINKS COMES OUT FISTS FLYING 
SHE'S LIKE CAROL SHE'S GOT THAT FAMILY OF MISFIT KIDS WITH DIFFERENT FATHERS ALL DIFFERENT AGES 
SHE'S GOT A TEENAGE STEP DAUGHTER SHE'S BEEN A MOTHER TO FOR SIX YEARS 
WHICH REMINDS YOU A BIT OF BIANCA AND CAROL BUT REVERSED ROLES 
SHE'S GOT FOUR KIDS AND IT'S VERY DEPRESSING ACTUALLY 
HER CIRCUMSTANCES SHE'S HOMELESS AND IT'S JUST A REAL STRUGGLE FOR HER 
SO AT THE MOMENT SHE'S JUST DERANGED WITH THESE KIDS AND NOWHERE TO LIVE AND NO MONEY 
SO IT'S QUITE HARD TO KNOW WHAT SHE'S THINKING 
COS ALL SHE'S THINKING ABOUT AT THE MOMENT IS HER KIDS 
EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS FAMILY IN THE SQUARE HER GRANDMOTHER PAT 
AND THE BRANNING FAMILY BIANCA DOESN'T ASK FOR HELP 
AND TRIES TO GET MONEY IN THE MOST DANGEROUS WAY 
WHY DON'T YOU GET IN THE BACK 
NEVER A GOOD IDEA TO TRY AND MANOEUVRE ROUND THE HAND BRAKE HEY HEY HEY 
I NEED THIS MONEY 
I'VE GOT KIDS 
YOU DON'T NEED IT PLEASE 
CHEATING COW 
IN THE PAST WHENEVER BIANCA WAS DOWN ON HER LUCK 
SHE COULD ALWAYS RELY ON HER KNIGHT IN GREASY OVERALLS 
I WAS GOOD SHE WAS HOT STEALING EVERYTHING SHE GOT 
I WAS BOLD SHE WAS OVER THE WORST OF IT 
GAVE ME GEAR THANK YOU DEAR BRING YOUR SISTER OVER HERE 
LET HER DANCE WITH ME JUST FOR THE HELL OF IT 
RICKY BUTCHER THE COMMON MAN'S PLONKER 
LOVABLE DOPEY MECHANIC 
RICKY IS A BIT THICK ISN'T HE 
AND HE'S EASILY LED 
HE'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE IN ALBERT SQUARE WHO'S MARGINALLY THICKER THAN BILLY 
DON'T BE STUPID WHAT YOU CAN'T COOK 'EM IN THE TOASTER WHY NOT 
SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK THAT RICKY IS A BIT THICK 
UM HE IS A BIT SLOW YEAH BUT I THINK HE'S MORE NAIVE 
HE MEANS WELL HE'S GOT A BIG HEART 
HE GOT THIS LABEL PUT ON HIM WHEN HE WAS LITTLE THAT HE WAS A BIT SLOW A BIT THICK 
WITH EVERYONE TELLING HIM HE BELIEVED IT 
HE'S A BIT DOWNTRODDEN NEVER QUITE GETS TO WHERE HE WANTS TO BE 
HE'S A GREAT CHAP BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT HIM ORGANISING ANYTHING SOPHISTICATED 
I SUPPOSE IN A FUNNY SORT OF WAY HE WAS THE SLOWER NOT SO SHARP 
AFFABLE SIDE OF FRANK 
WILL I GET COMMISSION 
ON WHAT WELL ON WHAT I COLLECT 
AT WHAT PERCENTAGE 
I DUNNO 
WHAT ARE YOU SOME SORT OF PILCHARD FIND OUT ALL RIGHT I WILL 
ALTHOUGH ACCUSED OF BEING A BIT SLOW RICKY HAD NO PROBLEM IN GETTING A QUICKIE 
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT RICKY WAS A BIG HIT WITH THE LADIES 
BUT I THINK THEY FOUND HIM ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE HE HAD A NICE SOFT SIDE 
HE WAS JUST A GENTLE GUY AND HE WAS JUST THERE FOR THEM REALLY 
SO WHAT D'YOU THINK THEN BIANCA THAT OUTFIT SAYS ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY 
GOOD COS I ONLY WANT IT TO SAY ONE THING 
WHEN BIANCA STARTED HITTING THE TOWN WITH HER BEST MATE TIFFANY RICKY WAS LEFT ALONE 
AND IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE HE SUCCUMBED TO TEMPTATION WITH ONE OF BIANCA'S CLOSEST FRIENDS 
YOU'RE SO FINE AND YOU'RE MINE 
I'LL BE YOURS TILL THE END OF TIME 
COS YOU MADE ME FEEL 
YEAH YOU MADE ME FEEL 
I'VE NOTHING TO HIDE 
RICKY I WAS GOING TO SAY FELL INTO THE ARMS OF NATALIE 
BUT HE DID HIS USUAL THING WHERE ANOTHER WOMAN TELLS HIM WHAT TO DO 
AND NATALIE SEDUCED HIM AND HE AGREED 
RICKY 
I'M ALWAYS REALLY SURPRISED THAT RICKY HAS THESE AFFAIRS YOU KNOW 
COS EVERY OTHER SIDE OF HIS PERSONALITY 
WOULD SAY THAT HE'D NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO ANYBODY 
WHILE BIANCA WAS OUT LIVING IT UP AND DANCING AND FLIPPING HER SKIRTS AROUND 
AND SCISSORING HER LONG LEGS ACROSS THE DANCE FLOOR 
THEY FOUND A KIND OF COMPANIONSHIP 
IN HOW THEY'D BOTH BEEN LEFT BY BIANCA 
RICKY FELT LIKE HE'D FOUND SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T NAG HIM 
WHO WAS KIND OF ON HIS WAVE LENGTH IN A WAY 
AND DIDN'T GIVE HIM TOO MUCH GRIEF AND I THINK HE QUITE LIKED THAT 
YOU WERE BRILLIANT 
I WASN'T 
IT WAS ME WEREN'T IT 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
I WEREN'T ANY GOOD 
I WAS RUBBISH YOU JUST DON'T WANNA TELL ME YOU WEREN'T 
YOU WERE LOVELY 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT NO I MEAN IT 
YOU WERE REALLY SWEET 
RICKY AND NATALIE'S AFFAIR ENDED BECAUSE NATALIE GOT GREEDY 
SHE WANTED ALL OF THE RICKY LOVING 
DO YOU REALLY LIKE ME RICKY I SAID I DO DON'T I THEN YOU'VE GOT TO TELL HER ABOUT US 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT NATALIE WAS EXPECTING TO GET OUT OF THIS 
THAT MAYBE RICKY WOULD LEAVE BIANCA AND COME WITH HER 
SURELY SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN DEEP DOWN THAT HE WOULDN'T 
SO NATALIE DECIDED SHE WOULD SET RICKY UP AND EXPOSE THEIR AFFAIR HERSELF 
NATALIE I MEAN SHE MASTERMINDED HER OWN DEMISE REALLY 
BECAUSE SHE ENGINEERED IT SO THAT BIANCA WOULD FIND HER WITH RICKY YOU KNOW MID SNOG 
I TELL YOU WANT YOU'RE GONNA DO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM 
HOW WELL FOLLOW HIM CATCH HIM AT IT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL KNOW FOR CERTAIN 
AND OF COURSE EXPLOSION SCREAMING SHOUTING CARNAGE BLOOD ON THE WALLS 
I THINK IT REALLY HURT BIANCA AND IT YEAH 
I DON'T THINK SHE COULD QUITE BELIEVE IT 
I THINK HER PRIDE WAS COMPLETELY DONE IN ON BOTH SIDES 
GOOD WAS IT HAVING US BOTH IT WEREN'T LIKE THAT SAVE YOUR BREATH I'VE SEEN WHAT I COME TO SEE 
BIANCA HOLD ON DON'T 
YOU'RE JUST SCUM THE PAIR OF YA 
BIANCA SLAPPED NATALIE MAYBE IF YOU'D TAKEN MORE NOTICE IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED 
I THINK LUCY MAY HAVE GOT A HIT IN THE FACE PERHAPS A REAL ONE 
BUT SHE ASKED ME TO DO THAT BY THE WAY 
YOU JUST DON'T CROSS BIANCA THAT WAY 
O. K. SHE'S A BIT OF A TART AND SHE'S BEEN DALLYING WITH OTHER MEN 
BUT YOU DO NOT GO ROUND SNOGGING HER MAN 
AND YET AGAIN RICKY HAD MESSED UP WITH THE WOMEN OF WALFORD 
HE SEEMS TO GO FOR THESE REALLY DOMINEERING BULLYING WOMEN WHO TELL HIM WHAT TO DO 
WHERE'S MY LUNCH I'VE LEFT IT ON THE WALL 
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE 'EM WRAPPED OR OPEN OPEN LOOK 
WHAT YOU DOING 
TRYING TO KISS YOU RICKY I THINK HE'D LIKED DOMINEERING WOMEN BECAUSE HE WAS SUCH A WUSS 
RICKY YEAH COMING 
I THINK HE JUST WANTS TO GO TO WORK HAVE A SIMPLE LIFE 
HAVE A NICE HAPPY FAMILY LIFE AT HOME BUT IT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN WITH BIANCA 
I PREDICT A RIOT 
I PREDICT A RIOT 
I PREDICT A RIOT 
I PREDICT A RIOT 
RICKY AND BIANCA'S RELATIONSHIP IS A KIND OF VERY TOUCHING 
KIND OF HOPEFUL YOUNG LOVE RELATIONSHIP 
WE'VE SEEN THEM GET TOGETHER WHEN THEY WERE VERY YOUNG AND TRACK RELATIONSHIP OVER YEARS 
O. I. DO YOU WANNA PAT MY BUM YEAH GO ON THEN 
RICKY AND BIANCA THEY BELONG TOGETHER IN AN ODD WAY 
BECAUSE THEY MAKE EACH OTHER COMPLETELY MISERABLE 
THEY CHEAT ON EACH OTHER THEY'RE NO GOOD 
THEY CAUSE MISERY FOR EACH OTHER BUT STILL RICKY BELONGS TO BIANCA 
RICKY AND BIANCA WERE THE GOLDEN COUPLE ESPECIALLY FOR MY GENERATION WATCHING IT 
AND EVEN THOUGH THINGS WOULD ALWAYS GO HORRIBLY WRONG FOR THEM 
YOU'RE PATHETIC YOU'RE A GREASY LITTLE TOAD I DON'T KNOW WHY I EVEN BOTHERED WITH YOU 
UNLESS YOU WANT A FULL SCALE ROW I SUGGEST YOU JUST GET OUT OF HERE THIS MINUTE 
THEY DEFINITELY HAD A LITTLE BOND THERE 
AND YOU ALWAYS LIKED WATCHING THEM TRYING TO GET THROUGH THEIR DAY TO DAY LIFE 
GOD THEIR RELATIONSHIP IT WAS COMPLETELY DYSFUNCTIONAL 
BUT LIKE A LOT OF RELATIONSHIPS IT JUST WORKED 
RICKY 
YOU LOOK GREAT THANKS 
UP AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN 
BUT I THINK THEY QUITE ENJOYED IT 
I THINK BOTH OF THEM PROBABLY FED OFF THAT KIND OF FIRE 
MY FINGERTIPS ARE HOLDING ONTO THE CRACKS IN OUR FOUNDATION 
AND I KNOW THAT I SHOULD LET GO BUT I CAN'T 
AND EVERY TIME WE FIGHT I KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT 
EVERY TIME THAT YOU'RE UPSET AND I SMILE 
I KNOW I SHOULD FORGET BUT I CAN'T 
I WOULDN'T MARRY YOU IF YOU WERE THE LAST MAN ON EARTH 
WELL WHAT YOU ALL LOOKING AT 
WHILE RICKY MIGHT HAVE WORN THE OVERALLS TO GO TO WORK BIANCA WORE THE TROUSERS IN THE RELATIONSHIP 
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GOING TO BE YOU AND ME TIFFANY'S A LAUGH I'M A LAUGH ARE YA 
WHO YOU WINKING AT NO ONE I HAD SOMETHING IN MY EYE 
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT SHE'S QUITE DOMINEERING QUITE PUSHY 
IF YOU WANNA GO SOMEWHERE ELSE I DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOUR MIND UP 
I'M GOING TO BED SHALL I COME WITH YOU WELL DO WHAT YOU WANT BUT WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING 
AFTER ALL WE WOULDN'T WANT TO DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE 
THE ONE THING WE'RE SURE ABOUT 
IS THAT HE ABSOLUTELY LOVED BIANCA AND I IMAGINE STILL LOVES BIANCA 
AIN'T YOU GONNA OPEN IT 
OH RICKY IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT I CAN CHANGE IT COS NO NO IT'S PERFECT 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY I LOVE YOU YEAH I KNOW 
SHE WAS A LITTLE TEMPEST IN QUITE A PLACID MAN'S LIFE IN RICKY'S LIFE 
COME ON WE'RE GOING I AIN'T GOING NOWHERE I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG 
YOU EITHER COME WITH ME NOW OR YOU DON'T BOTHER GET LOST THEN 
WILL YOU STOP SULKING FOR FIVE MINUTES I'M NOT THAT'S BETTER 
SHOUT AT ME TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER I'M SORRY 
RICKY GET LOST I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR UGLY FACE 
THEY WERE ALMOST SORT OF OPPOSITES REALLY 
RICKY WAS QUITE A SIMPLE PERSON WHO WAS JUST EASY GOING 
AND THEN BIANCA WAS THIS LIVE WIRE JUST COMPLETE LUNATIC 
AND I THINK HE LIKED THE EXCITEMENT OF IT 
AND AFTER ALL THE ARGUMENTS THE MAKING UP AND THE ARGUMENTS 
AND THE MAKING UP RICKY AND BIANCA DID MANAGE TO MAKE IT DOWN THE AISLE 
IT'S A NICE DAY FOR A WHITE WEDDING 
I REMEMBER IT BEING FREEZING COLD AND THEN COMING OUTSIDE IT WAS LIKE THE ROYAL WEDDING IT WAS MENTAL 
AND BIANCA JOINED ONE OF THE MOST DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES IN ALBERT SQUARE THE BUTCHERS 
THE BUTCHERS WERE MADE UP OF FRANK RICKY DIANE 
JANINE JANINE AND JANINE 
THEY WERE LATER JOINED BY PAT BIANCA AND PEGGY 
THE BUTCHERS HAVE BEEN HUGELY IMPORTANT ON THE SQUARE 
I THINK THEY CAME IN AT A TIME WHEN ALMOST THE FIRST LEGACY 
THE FIRST WAVE OF REALLY MASSIVE CHARACTERS LIKE DEN AND ANGIE WERE MOVING ON 
BY THE WAY THANKS FOR HELPING OUT ANY TIME YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A JOB 
THAT'S NICE OF YOU DEN THANKS 
FRANK AND THE BUTCHERS I THINK REALLY SUCCESSFULLY FILLED THAT HOLE IN THE SHOW 
AND THEY'VE GIVEN US LOADS OF STORIES OVER THE YEARS 
AND THEY SAY HISTORY HAS A HABIT OF REPEATING ITSELF 
IAN PEGGY TOLD ME 
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER 
LUCY I JUST THOUGHT WITH YOU DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR WHEN YOU WERE A KID 
YOU MIGHT KNOW WHERE OR HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE SORT OF PLACE THAT 
LONG BEFORE LUCY BEALE WAS THROWING HER TOYS OUT OF THE PRAM 
ANOTHER WAYWARD DAUGHTER WAS CAUSING CHAOS IN ALBERT SQUARE 
WHITE RIOT I WANNA RIOT WHITE RIOT A RIOT OF MY OWN 
DIANE WAS SHARP SMART AND YOU COULD PERHAPS 
SEE THE ELEMENTS OF HER MOTHER PERHAPS IN HER 
A SHARP TONGUE AND A QUICK MIND 
WHY DON'T YOU STOP TREATING ME LIKE A KID I DON'T YOU DO EVERYBODY DOES 
YOU COULD SEE HER LOOKING AT HER FAMILY AND LOOKING AT WALFORD 
AND THINKING THIS AIN'T FOR ME 
I LEARNED SOMETHING AND THAT IS NOTHING ROUND HERE IS DONE FOR ME 
SHE WAS A BIT OF A WILD CHILD SHE'S A BIT NAUGHTY SHE WAS ALWAYS IN TROUBLE 
I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH LOSING HER MOTHER AT AN EARLY AGE 
DIANE RAN AWAY FROM HOME AFTER A BIG ARGUMENT WITH FRANK 
AND THINKING THAT NO ONE LOVED HER 
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ME I WON'T CARE ABOUT THEM 
SHE RAN AWAY TO MAKE A STATEMENT 
I THINK IT WAS A NOTICE ME KIND OF THING WORKED 
SHOULD I GIVE UP OR SHOULD I JUST KEEP CHASING PAVEMENTS 
CALL THE POLICE 
WE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING OF HER FOR QUITE A FEW MONTHS 
AND THEN WE MET HER AGAIN 
AND SHE WAS PALE AND DRAWN AND SCUZZY 
AND AFTER THREE MONTHS ON THE STREET SHE EVENTUALLY GOT IN CONTACT WITH FRANK AND CAME HOME 
BUT SHE FOUND IT HARD TO ADJUST TO LIFE BACK IN THE SQUARE 
AND AFTER A FAILED ROMANCE WITH MARK FOWLER SHE DID A RUNNER TO FRANCE 
FRANK AND PAT WENT TO VISIT HER IN PARIS SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND YOU SAW HIM GO BABE 
DAD 
PRINCESS 
THE REACTION ON THEIR FACES WAS BRILLIANT 
YOU'RE PREGNANT 
THERE'S NO FOOLING YOU IS THERE DAD D'YOU WANT TO COME IN 
MIKE HAD THIS LINE WHEN HE WAS TALKING TO ME ABOUT WHO WAS THE FATHER AND DIANE DIDN'T KNOW 
AND IT WAS EITHER A FRENCHMAN OR A GERMAN 
A GERMAN 
YOU'RE TELLING ME MY GRANDCHILD'S A RUDDY KRAUT 
I TOLD YOU I DON'T KNOW 
AIN'T MUCH CHOICE EITHER WAY REALLY IS THERE FROG KRAUT 
YOU REALLY MAKE ME SICK SOMETIMES 
IT WAS JUST SUCH A MIKE LINE 
LIKE RICKY DIANE HAS RETURNED TO WALFORD TO ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF HER FATHER FRANK 
AND FOR A MEMBER OF THE BUTCHER FAMILY SHE SEEMS RATHER NORMAL 
COMING BACK SHE SEEMS QUITE NICE ACTUALLY 
SHE SEEMS MUCH MORE RELAXED AND SHE'S SO MUCH OLDER I SUPPOSE 
SHE'S GROWN UP AND SEEMS QUITE NICE AND KIND AND SETTLED WITH HER LIFE 
AND WHAT OF HER FATHER FRANK BUTCHER A MAN WHO CAUSED MAYHEM WHEREVER HE WENT 
DESTROYED THE LIVES OF ANYONE HE TOUCHED AND SHOOK THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF ALBERT SQUARE 
OH LORD PLEASE DON'T LET ME BE MISUNDERSTOOD 
HOW CAN YOU DESCRIBE SOMEBODY AS ICONIC AS FRANK BUTCHER 
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY 
ONCE A USED CAR SALESMAN ALWAYS A CROOK 
FRANK BUTCHER'S A LOVABLE ROGUE 
A CHARACTER LARGER THAN LIFE 
YOU CAN NEVER FORGET THAT HUSKY KIND OF SEXY THING HE HAD GOING ON 
I'D STAY OUT OF THIS IF I WAS YOU PAL 
UNREASONABLE AS IT MAY SEEM I'M FINDING IT VERY HARD 
NOT TO COME OVER THERE AND HANG ONE ON YOUR CHIN FRANK 
PAT LEAVE IT 
DIDN'T HE CALL PEOPLE YOU PILCHARD 
GET OUT THE WAY YOU SPANISH PILCHARD 
THE GLASSES COME OFF THE HAND OVER THE EYES OH RICKY FIVE GRAND 
FRANK BUTCHER'S A KIND OF FORCE OF NATURE 
HE'S LIKE CHARMING AFFABLE DOMINATES ANY SITUATION 
BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY TRUST HIM BUT YOU LOVE HIM 
PAT YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU LIKE BUT THIS IS A BIG DAY FOR ME 
WE NEED BIN LINERS AND POLISH DETAILS PAT DO NOT BOTHER ME WITH DETAILS 
WILL YOU LET ME FINISH WE ALSO NEED SOMETHING TO APPLY IT 
FRANK HAD ALWAYS BEEN A DREAMER TRYING TO CREATE A GREAT BUTCHER EMPIRE 
FANCY A PINT 
BUT ENDED UP DEPRESSED BANKRUPT 
FOUR AND A HALF GRAND ARE YOU HAVIN' A LARK OR SOMETHING 
AND AT ONE POINT EVEN FAKED HIS OWN DEATH 
IT'S ALL PART OF THE FRANK BUTCHER EXPERIENCE AIN'T IT IAN 
HOW TO HAVE THE WHOLE WORLD IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND AND 
BLOW IT IN TEN EASY LESSONS 
FRANK DID DESTROY EVERYTHING HE TOUCHED BUT HE NEVER DID IT WITH MALICE 
HE WAS JUST 
HE COULDN'T HELP HIMSELF 
EVEN FRANK'S CHILDREN DIDN'T ESCAPE HIS DESTRUCTIVE NATURE 
RICKY JANINE WENT OFF THE RAILS 
DIANE RAN AWAY FROM HOME 
BUT HE DID HAVE GREAT AFFECTION FOR HIS SON RICKY 
WHATEVER I DID 
I NEVER MEANT TO HURT YOU 
I KNOW DAD I KNOW SON YOU WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YEAH 
RICKY AND FRANK HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP REALLY HE LOOKED UP TO FRANK HE RESPECTED HIM A LOT 
HE ALMOST WANTED TO BE LIKE FRANK 
OH RICKY YOU LOOK LOVELY 
FRANK WHAT DO YOU THINK 
HOW MUCH IT COST YA IT WAS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOR THE DEPOSIT AND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE PER WEEK OVER TWENTY WEEKS 
YOU WERE ROBBED I DON'T THINK FRANK GAVE RICKY THE CHANCE TO EVER GROW UP REALLY 
COS HE'D ALWAYS TALK TO HIM LIKE A LITTLE BOY AND BE SORT OF QUITE PATRONISING AND CONDESCENDING 
YOU STILL GONNA CHARGE HIM FIVE HUNDRED QUID DON'T ASK STUPID QUESTIONS 
BUT THEY HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP 
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH 
AND I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YA 
AND NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN YOU ARE 
EXCEPT FOR WOMEN THEY WERE ON TOP OF FRANK'S LIST 
O. I. FRANK LEAVE THE LADY ALONE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME FOR THAT LATER 
THAT'S NO LADY THAT'S MY WIFE 
HE HAD THESE KIND OF HIDDEN ROMANTIC DEPTHS 
WHICH ENABLED HIM TO ENSNARE BOTH PEGGY AND PAT 
THE TWO HUGE MATRIARCHS ON THE SQUARE 
INTO THIS ULTIMATELY DESTRUCTIVE LOVE TRIANGLE 
YOU BITCH YOU COW 
GET STUFFED DO YOUR OWN DIRTY WORK HEY 
YOU MUST HAVE FELT AT HOME LAYING ON YOUR BACK LOOKING UP AT MY FRANK 
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU FRANK BUTCHER 
I LOVE YOU PAT 
COME ON COME ON LET'S STICK TOGETHER 
YOU BITCH 
COW 
I LOVE YOU 
FRANK 
ORIGINALLY FRANK BUTCHER WAS ONLY GOING TO BE IN A FEW EPISODES 
BUT HE WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR CHARACTERS IN THE SHOW 
AND THAT'S CREDITED TO THE COMIC ACTOR WHO PLAYED HIM THE LATE MIKE REID 
FRANK BUTCHER I MIGHT BE 
I THINK MAYBE HIS PERFORMANCE WAS COMPLETELY UNIQUE 
NO ONE ELSE COULD HAVE DONE WHAT HE DID HE WAS A STAND UP COMIC 
ERE THERE WAS THIS GEEZER PLAYING THE PIANO SEE YOU'LL LIKE THIS 
I THINK IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY'D USED A COMIC FOR A SERIOUS ROLE 
AND YOU JUST UTTERLY BELIEVED IN THIS VERY LOVABLE MAN 
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT CAN PULL OFF THAT CHARISMA AND CHARM 
AND DO THE SERIOUS STUFF AND THE COMEDY HE JUST HAD IT ALL REALLY 
YOU'VE GOT FAIRDEAL FRANK'S WORD ON THAT 
I THINK MIKE'S PERFORMANCE AS FRANK WAS FANTASTIC 
HE BROUGHT SOME NATURALNESS TO IT 
OH I'M SO SORRY I AM SO SORRY 
I JUST IDOLISED MIKE ANYWAY AND HE KNEW THAT I JUST THOUGHT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS 
ALWAYS GOT A GREAT BIG CUDDLE ALWAYS THERE TO CHEER EVERYBODY UP AT THE END OF A LONG DAY 
ANY CHANCE OF SOME SERVICE AT THIS WATERING HOLE SORRY 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT A LARGE VODKA AND LEMONADE 
EVEN BEFORE I WAS IN THE SHOW I USED TO WATCH AND IT REMINDED ME OF MY DAD AND MY UNCLES 
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE HE'S REAL HE'S PROPER 
GIMME 'EM COME ON GIMME 'EM COME ON GIMME 'EM 
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT BUT DON'T DO ME ANY FAVOURS 
I WORK AN ALL I KNOW YOU WORK I KNOW YOU WORK 
WE COULD ALMOST THROW ANY LINE AT EACH OTHER AND PICK IT UP 
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO STRAY OFF SCRIPT 
MAYBE IF YOU GOT OVER THERE AND SOLD A FEW CARS WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION 
AND YOU MIGHT BE IN A BETTER MOOD 
MOST WRITERS DON'T LIKE PEOPLE CHANGING THEIR LINES 
BUT MIKE REID WOULD OCCASIONALLY CHANGE A LINE CHUCK SOMETHING IN IT WAS ALWAYS BRILLIANT 
WHY DON'T YOU COME IF YOU SIT HERE MULLING THINGS OVER 
RICKY JUST LEAVE ME ALONE SON WILL YA 
BUT DAD FOR CRYING OUT LOUD BOY LEAVE ME ALONE 
WORKING WITH MIKE WAS JUST THE BEST IT REALLY WAS' 
HE USED TO GET SO INTO HIS WORK AND GET REALLY WOUND UP 
HE USED TO GO RED AND BLUE IN THE FACE 
HIS BIG EARS WOULD BE BURNING AND WITH THE SCENES WHERE I'D BE DOING SOMETHING WRONG 
AND HE'D GO RICKY WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU 
HE'D GET RIGHT INTO IT 
MUM YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH COME ON 
YOU'RE FINISHED LEAVE ME ALONE 
A LOT OF COMICS SEEM TO BE GREAT ACTORS MIKE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 
ESPECIALLY IN SOAP AND HE WAS JUST A GREAT ACTOR 
A WHITER SHADE OF PALE BY PROCOL HARUM 
WITH THE SAD DEATH OF MIKE REID IN JULY LAST YEAR 
IT WAS EVENTUALLY DECIDED THAT THE CHARACTER OF FRANK BUTCHER 
HE HAD PLAYED ON AND OFF FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SHOULD ALSO BE LAID TO REST 
TODAY WE ARE DOING THE FUNERAL OF FRANK BUTCHER 
MIKE REID'S CHARACTER WHO SADLY DIED LAST YEAR 
AND IT'S SORT OF A TRIBUTE TO HIM REALLY THIS WHOLE EPISODE

BARBARA STEVE MCFADDEN PAM SAINT CLEMENT JUNE BROWN ADAM WOODYATT 
BILLY HELLO MATE

BUT THERE IS ONE NOTABLE ABSENTEE FROM FRANK'S FUNERAL WHEN I SEE BIANCA 
I NEVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING FRANCIS I'LL KILL HER 
FRANK HE REALLY LIKED BIANCA I THINK HE THOUGHT SHE WAS FUNNY 
AND THE HORRIBLE THING IS NOW OF COURSE THEY'RE FILMING HIS FUNERAL 
AND OF COURSE BIANCA'S LYING WHICH IS A HORRIBLE THING 
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN SHE'S AS HURT ABOUT FRANK AS RICKY BUT OF COURSE SHE CAN'T TELL HIM 
SHE ACTUALLY SAYS I CAN'T CRY I WISH I COULD 
SHE SAYS GOODBYE TO HIM 
ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER AND YOU ALWAYS SAID YOU LOVED ME IN RED 
SO FRANK DARLING THIS IS FOR YOU 
THERE'S NO LOVE SONG FINER 
BUT HOW STRANGE 
THE CHANGE 
FROM MAJOR TO MINOR 
EVERY TIME 
WE SAY GOODBYE 
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF BABE 
THE FUNERAL HAS ALSO SEEN THE RETURN OF ONE OF EASTENDERS' MOST UNSAVOURY CHARACTERS JANINE 
HELLO PAT 
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY 
I NOT ABOUT TO PAY NOBODY'S WAY 
COS IT'S ALL ABOUT THE DOLL IN ME 
OH JANINE JANINE IS THE BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST 
SHE IS A DELIGHT TO WRITE FOR 
SHE IS DAMAGE AND SHE IS ALSO DAMAGED 
JANINE'S A MONSTER ACTUALLY AN ABSOLUTE MONSTER 
SHE'S JUST A COMPLETE AND UTTER VICIOUS VILE WOMAN 
I'VE GONE DAD'S GONE 
AND WHO HAVE YOU GOT NO ONE

MONEY GRABBING SCHEMING 
HUSBAND MURDERING LITTLE COW ISN'T SHE I DO LIKE HER THOUGH 
SHE WAS A JOYOUS MINX REALLY 
AND SHE WOULD DO PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS 
LEAVE THE MONEY ON THE SIDE 
THIS NEVER HAPPENED ALL RIGHT 
JANINE WAS THE A CLASS TOP B. I T. C. H. 
AND WHEN YOUR DREAMS ARE ON A TRAIN TO TRAIN THAT TOWN 
THEN I ASK YOU NOW 
WHAT'S A GIRL TO DO 
SHE'S BEEN A MIXED UP CHARACTER FROM HER UPBRINGING UP UNTIL NOW 
I DON'T THINK SHE'S EVER DISCOVERED HER TRUE IDENTITY 
I THINK SHE CONSTANTLY BATTLES WITH HERSELF TO BE SOMETHING THAT SHE'S NOT 
SHE WAS ALWAYS OVERLOOKED SHE WAS IGNORED SEEN AS A BURDEN TROUBLE 
COS SHE WAS A KID WHO NEEDED A MOTHER WHEN THERE WASN'T ONE 
JANINE MOVE THOSE THINGS PLEASE 
YOU LITTLE MADAM YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO YOU'RE NOT MY MUM 
WHILE YOU'RE UNDER THIS ROOF YOU WILL DO AS YOU ARE TOLD 
NOW PICK THAT UP PLEASE NO 
PICK IT UP NOW PICK IT UP YOURSELF YOU OLD COW 
JANINE TOOK GREAT PLEASURE IN MAKING PAT'S LIFE AN UTTER MISERY 
AND DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO TRY AND SPLIT HER AND HER FATHER UP 
I'M FED UP WITH YOU BOSSING ME I ASKED YOU WHAT YOU SAID YOU'RE A FAT OLD COW AND I HATE YOU 
GO ON THEN HIT ME AND SEE WHAT ME DAD SAYS 
OUT YOU HEARD ME GET OUT OF THIS ROOM 
JANINE HATED PAT SHE WAS AN ABSOLUTE BRAT FRANK COULDN'T DISCIPLINE HER 
ALL THAT FRANK WOULD DO WAS BUY HER PRESENTS AND SPOIL HER 
YOU'LL BRING ME SOMETHING BACK WON'T YOU I SHALL BRING YOU LOTS AND LOTSBACK GIVE DAD A KISS 
LOOK AFTER HER YEAH 
YEAH ALL RIGHT GOOD GIRL 
AS MUCH AS SHE LOVED HER DAD AND SHE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO PROVE SOMETHING TO HER DAD 
HE DISMISSED HER AND FORGOT ABOUT HERWHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER AND I DON'T THINK SHE EVER FORGOT THAT 
I TELL YOU WHAT BEFORE YOU GO BACK I'LL TAKE YOU UP TOWN AND BUY YOU SOMETHING NICE AND CHIC 
WHAT ABOUT HIS AFTERNOON I NEED A NEW OUTFIT DARLING I CAN'T I'M UP TO ME NECK IN IT 
FRANK COULDN'T COPE WITH HER AND A LOT OF THE TIME USED TO BLANK IT OUT 
OR RUN AWAY FROM THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT WERE JANINE 
THAT EVENTUALLY LED US TO THE CREATURE THAT STALKED ALBERT SQUARE THAT WAS JANINE BUTCHER 
AND JANINE'S BIGGEST VICTIM WAS BARRY EVANS 
SHE DUG HER CLAWS INTO HIM AND BLED HIM DRY BEFORE SHE CHUCKED HIM AWAY 
AGH 
BUT IT WOULD BE THE DEATH OF ANOTHER EASTENDER THAT CAUSED JANINE'S EVENTUALLY DOWNFALL 
THE FEUD WITH LAURA STARTED COS SHE FOUND OUT THAT 
IAN HAD BEEN PAYING JANINE FOR SEX IN MY DAYS AS A PROZZY 
LAURA 
LAURA WAIT LAURA LAURA 
HOLD ON WHAT'S GOING ON 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING GIRL 
LEAVING YOU IAN WHAT 
STEVEN'S TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU AND JANINE 
WHAT ABOUT ME AND JANINE COME ON AT LEAST BE A MAN AND OWN UP TO IT 
FROM THEN ON THEY WERE AT EACH OTHER LIKE PIT BULL TERRIERS 
UNTIL ONE FATAL NIGHT 
SHE'D BEEN ROUND TO SEE LAURA AND THEY'D HAD A CAT FIGHT THE NIGHT THAT LAURA DIED 
EVERY TIME SOMEONE GETS CLOSE TO YOU THEY SEE YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE AND THEY RUN 
YOU SHOULD WEAR A LITTLE BELL LET THEM KNOW YOU'RE COMING 
JANINE DID NOT KILL LAURA BEALE 
SHE SUFFERED A TRAGIC ACCIDENT AT THE HANDS OF HER OWN CHILD'S TOY 
AND TRIPPED MELODRAMATICALLY AND BROKE HER NECK ON THE STAIRS FATAL 
IAN WAIT 
PAT DECIDED TO FRAME JANINE WHO HAD IN FACT STAY WITH ME 
MURDERED HER EX HUSBAND BARRY UP IN SCOTLAND 
SO YOU'D LIE TO THEM 
YOU'D HAVE ME BANGED UP FOR SOMETHING THAT I DID NOT DO 
WELL IT WOULD SQUARE THINGS 
IN SORT OF PAT BUTCHER VIGILANTE STYLE 
TOOK JUSTICE INTO HER OWN HANDS AND WREAKED HER REVENGE UPON JANINE 
PAT SAW THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY AVENGE BARRY'S DEATH 
IF SHE WON'T GO DOWN FOR THAT MURDER I'LL HAVE HER GO DOWN FOR LAURA'S 
WITH THE POLICE IN HOT PURSUIT JANINE TRIES TO DO A RUNNER WITH THE MOST PRECIOUS THING IN HER LIFE 
AS SHE GETS CAUGHT BY THE POLICE MONEY JUST EXPLODES EVERYWHERE 
AND SHE WAS CUFFED AND SENT OFF IN A POLICE CAR 
LEAST IT WASN'T A BLACK TAXI 
LUCKILY FOR JANINE PAT EVENTUALLY TOLD THE TRUTH OF HOW LAURA DIED AND JANINE WALKED FREE 
AND WITH THE SCENT OF MONEY COMING FROM HER FATHER'S WILL 
THE BITCH IS BACK 
I WANNA HEAL I WANNA FEEL LIKE I'M CLOSE TO SOMETHING REAL 
I WANNA TO FIND SOMETHING I'VE WANTED ALL ALONG 
SOMEWHERE I BELONG 
WELL FIRST EXCUSE THE TEARS IT'S MY FIRST DAY BACK AND I'VE JUST DONE MY LAST SCENE WHERE JANINE DEPARTS 
AND SHE HAS A TEARFUL MOMENT WITH PAT 
O. K. REHEARSING THEN THANK YOU 
AND ACTION 
SO WHY DID YOU COME BACK 
SHE GETS A WHIFF OF MONEY AND COMES BACK TO SEE WHAT SHE CAN GET HER HANDS ON 
BUT I THINK SHE'S SO MIXED UP SHE DOESN'T QUITE KNOW HERSELF 
BECAUSE ALL THESE EMOTIONS ARE BROUGHT UP MEMORIES OF WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL 
AND YOU NEVER QUITE KNOW WITH JANINE DO YOU 
JANINE 
I CAME ON SET EARLIER I HAD THIS POWER OUTFIT ON 
THIS COAT AND THE SKIRT AND KILLER HEELS 
AND IT FEELS FANTASTIC WHOA JANINE'S BACK 
JUST FOR A SMALL STINT BUT YEAH IT FEELS GREAT 
YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
THE THING ABOUT JANINE IS THERE'S ALWAYS THE HOPE 
THAT PAT AND JANINE COULD FINALLY COME TOGETHER 
AND BE A KIND OF MOTHER AND DAUGHTER 
BUT YOU NEVER REALLY TRUST JANINE 
WHATEVER SHE SAYS YOU CAN'T HELP THINKING SHE'S HATCHING A PLAN 
WILL SHE BE BACK WHO KNOWS 
YOU KNOW I NEVER SAY NEVER 
AND I'M HAVING A LOVELY LOVELY TIME BEING HERE FOR THIS SPECIAL 
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO BE BACK AND I'VE SLIPPED INTO IT REALLY NICELY 
IT'S LIKE I'VE NEVER BEEN AWAY 
SO YEAH I THINK IT WILL BE REALLY INTERESTING IN THE FUTURE 
TO FIND OUT WHERE JANINE'S BEEN AND WHAT SHE'S BEEN UP TO 
AND WHETHER SHE HAS ACTUALLY GOT ALL THIS MONEY OR WHETHER SHE'S JUST HIRED THE CAR FOR THE DAY 
AND WITH ONE BUTCHER LEAVING WALFORD A FORMER ONE ARRIVES 
BUT THE ONLY THING BIANCA'S DRIVING IS HERSELF MAD 
AS SHE TRIES TO FIND SOMEWHERE FOR HER AND HER CHILDREN TO STAY 
STICK AROUND AND WATCH ME FALL APART 
WATCH ME LOSE THE GAME THAT I MADE UP 
AND THE BACKSTREETS OF WATFORD PROVIDE THE BACKDROP FOR BIANCA'S LIFE JUST OUTSIDE ALBERT SQUARE 
WE ARE AT BIANCA'S FRIEND'S CHARMAINE 
SHE ASKED FOR SOME HELP BUT SHE DOESN'T GIVE HER IT 
I'M SORRY 
I REALLY AM 
BUT IT TOOK US AGES TO GET THIS PLACE 
I CAN'T LOSE IT NOW 
IT'S ALL RIGHT 
LIKE YOU SAID IT'S YOUR HOME AND YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT LOOK I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT 
AND PLAYING THE PART OF BIANCA YOU NEED TO LOOK THE PART OF BIANCA 
I SAID TO THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT DON'T WORRY JUST DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE 
COS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS KIND OF PART OF WHAT SHE WAS LIKE 
SHE DIDN'T EVER GET IT RIGHT WITH HER FASHION 
SO IT'S QUITE GOOD TO BE ABLE TO DO IT AGAIN 
THEY'VE GIVEN ME THE SILVER PUFFA JACKET 
AND THE OTHER ONE WAS ACTUALLY PUT IN A TIME CAPSULE WE THINK IN THE BLUE PETER GARDEN 
SO WE'LL HAVE TO DIG IT UP IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
IT'S ALL RIGHT I'VE GOT SOME STICKY TAPE IN ME BAG I'LL HAVE HIM GAGGED IN NO TIME 
AND CUT CUT THERE 
HOW HAD BIANCA COME TO THIS 
WHERE DID IT GO SO WRONG 
AS USUAL WITH BIANCA IT STARTED WITH AN OLDER MAN 
AND THIS TIME IT WOULD BE WITH HER MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND 
BIANCA AND DAN'S AFFAIR WAS ONE OF THE CLASSIC EASTENDERS AFFAIRS 
A REALLY REALLY BRILLIANT ONE 
WHEN DAN CAME ALONG YOU SORT OF KNEW THAT THAT WAS GOING TO WRECK 
THE RICKY BIANCA BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP THEY HAD 
BIANCA THIS IS DAN BIANCA IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU AT LAST 
YEAH AND YOU 
THE MINUTE HE AND BIANCA CLAPPED EYES ON EACH OTHER YOU KNEW THERE WAS THIS HISTORY 
THIS DARK AND QUITE DANGEROUS BUT VERY VERY EXHILARATING AND THRILLING HISTORY 
DAN IT TURNED OUT WHEN HE MET BIANCA HAD HAD AN AFFAIR 
WITH BIANCA YEARS BEFORE WHEN BIANCA WAS A SCHOOLGIRL AND UNDER AGE 
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU SPOIL MY HAPPINESS OVER NOTHING AND WE HAD NOTHING 
IT WAS CHEAP AND IT WAS MEANINGLESS AND IT'S BEST FORGOTTEN 
NOW WOULDN'T YOU AGREE 
BIANCA TRIED REALLY HARD TO TURN CAROL AGAINST DAN 
SHE TRIED TO UNDERMINE THEIR RELATIONSHIP SHE DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD 
HAVE A GOOD LOOK AT HIM COS YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE I LOVE HIM YOU JUST CAN'T SEE IT CAN YA 
HE'S JUST THE SAME AS DAVID JUST THE SAME AS ALL THE REST OF 'EM 
BUT THE FACT WAS THAT SHE STILL FELT THE SAME WAY ABOUT HIM 
I WAS IN LOVE WITH YA 
I STILL AM 
OR AT LEAST I THINK I AM SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING 
I LOVE YOU DAN 
AS MUCH AS SHE WANTED TO LOVE RICKY AND BE WITH RICKY FOR EVER 
SHE JUST COULDN'T RESIST THE PULL OF DAN 
BIANCA FELL FOR DAN BECAUSE HE WAS TWICE THE SIZE OF RICKY HE HAD TWICE THE BRAIN OF RICKY 
HE ALMOST MANIPULATED HER AND SHE WAS A BIT STARRY EYED 
YOU KNOW THERE WAS THIS BIG STRAPPING GUY GOOD LOOKING MAN 
VOULEZ VOUS COUCHER AVEC MOI CE SOIR 
VOULEZ VOUS COUCHER AVEC MOI 
THE WAY DAN AND BIANCA WERE CAUGHT WAS UM 
A PHOTO FROM THE PAST 
WHICH TOOK US RIGHT BACK TO THAT RELATIONSHIP WHEN SHE WAS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID 
AND HE WAS THIS OLDER GUY AND BIANCA REJECTS HIM 
WE HAD SOMETHING SPECIAL WE CAN'T BLOW IT NOW WE HAD NOTHING 
DID YOU HEAR ME 
NOTHING 
CAROL FINDS A LITTLE BIT OF THE PICTURE WHEN SHE'S TIDYING AND 
OBVIOUSLY IS SLIGHTLY CURIOUS BY THIS 
AND SHE LOOKS AT ONE BIT OF THE PHOTOGRAPH AND IT'S DAN 
AND SHE PUTS ANOTHER BIT TOGETHER AND THEN THERE'S A GIRL WITH HIM 
YOU JUST SEE AS SHE'S PHYSICALLY PIECING THIS THING TOGETHER 
HER BRAIN IS PIECING SOMETHING TOGETHER AS WELL 
AND SHE REALISES SHE'S LOOKING AT A PICTURE OF DAN WITH HER DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD 
AND OF COURSE IT'S BLOOD ON THE WALLS ONCE AGAIN 
TAKE MY PHOTO OFF THE WALL 
IF IT JUST WON'T SING FOR YOU 
COS ALL THAT'S LEFT IS GONE AWAY 
AND THERE'S NOTHING THERE FOR YOU TO PROVE 
THE AFTERMATH OF THAT DISCOVERY WAS ER 
IT WAS AN HOUR LONG EPISODE AND IT WAS A TORTUOUS EXPLORATION OF THAT FAMILY COMING APART 
CAROL'S REACTION WAS JUST YOU KNOW OFF THE SCALE 
IT WAS AN UTTER BETRAYAL 
FROM HER DAUGHTER AND FROM HER LOVER 
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GO AWAY GO AWAY 
GO AWAY 
YOU GOT THE MESSAGE NOW 
BIANCA SHE COULDN'T LIVE WITH HERSELF 
AND SHE HAD THAT REALLY EMOTIONAL SCENE WITH HER MUM WHICH WAS REALLY SAD 
YOU'VE DONE THE ONE THING I COULD NEVER DO YOU MADE A COMPROMISE 
YOU CHOSE A BLOKE FOR LIFE RATHER THAN JUST A QUICK THRILL 
BUT YOU WEREN'T SATISFIED I WARNED YA 
SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALONE UP IN MANCHESTER ON YOUR OWN JUST YOU AND LIAM 
THERE'LL BE NO ONE AROUND NO FAMILY TO HELP OUT 
YOU'LL BE TIRED BROKE THEN YOUR LOOKS WILL GO AND YOU'LL GET LESS CHOOSY WITH THE FELLAS 
ONE DAY YOU'LL WALK DOWN THE ROAD AND YOU'LL SEE RICKY AND YOU'LL CRY YOUR EYES OUT 
COS YOU'LL KNOW WHAT YOU JUST THREW AWAY 
HAVING BEEN ALIENATED FROM THE WHOLE SQUARE BIANCA LEFT WALFORD 
FOR MANCHESTER BUT SHE WOULD HAVE ONE MORE CHANCE TO GET RICKY BACK 
AT THE LAST MINUTE RICKY RUNS AFTER HER HE DOES EVERYTHING HE CAN HE CATCHES HER 
BIANCA RICKY 
BIANCA'S OVERJOYED COS SHE WANTS HIM BACK HE'S OVERJOYED THEN HE SAYS HE WANTS TO KNOW ONE THING 
AM I A COMPROMISE OR AM I REALLY WHAT YOU WANT 
AM I 
NO 
DIDN'T EVER QUITE BELIEVE THAT 
I THINK SHE COULDN'T LIVE WITH HERSELF WHAT SHE'D DONE SHE HAD TO GET OUTTA TOWN 
IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AN EASTENDERS' SPECIAL CAUGHT UP WITH BIANCA LIVING IN MANCHESTER 
WHILST RICKY WAS TRYING TO GET CUSTODY OF THEIR SON LIAM 
WHEN THEY HAD THE ONE OFF SPIN OFF OF RICKY AND BIANCA IN MANCHESTER 
I JUST REMEMBER A BIG BUZZ AROUND MY SCHOOL AND EVERYONE WAS GOING TO TUNE IN 
AND IT WAS REALLY NICE TO SEE THE PEOPLE I'D GROWN UP WITH 
COS YOU DO OFTEN THINK OF WHAT CERTAIN CHARACTERS ARE DOING AND IT WAS REALLY LOVELY 
BUT IT WAS WASN'T HAPPY FOR THEM WAS IT WHICH WAS A SHAME 
THE BAD LUCK STARTS WHEN BIANCA GETS KICKED OUT OF COLLEGE 
WE'VE DECIDED THIS COURSE ISN'T FOR YOU 
SHE THEN STEALS MONEY FROM THE NIGHTCLUB WHERE SHE WORKS 
BUT IT'S DRUG MONEY AND RICKY GETS HER TO PUT IT BACK 
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS BACK I CAN'T I'M SCARED 
I'LL COME WITH YA 
UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE CAUGHT AND THREATENED 
YOU DO ME A FAVOUR 
I'LL WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN FORGET THIS EVER HAPPENED 
THEY'RE FORCED TO DO A JOB BUT IT'S A SET UP AND THE POLICE ARRIVE 
LET'S GO 
RICKY AND BIANCA GET AWAY ONLY TO END UP IN BED 
BUT IT'S NOT THE REKINDLING THAT RICKY NOW HOPES FOR 
AS BIANCA DOES A RUNNER LEAVING HIM AND LIAM TO FACE THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS TOGETHER 
THE TIDAL WAVE OF HIGH EMOTION IS ABOUT TO HIT ALBERT SQUARE AGAIN 
RICKY AND BIANCA ARE BACK 
RICKY Y. Y. Y. Y. 
BUT THEIR LIVES ARE NOW POLES APART 
RICKY'S LIFE HASN'T CHANGED MUCH 
QUITE COMFORTABLE 
I WENT TO SEE THE FLAT AGAIN LAST NIGHT RICKY 
THE ONE IN MUSWELL HILL GO ON NEAR MY PARENTS THEY'RE ACCEPTED OUR OFFER 
THE RELATIONSHIP HE'S BEEN IN WITH MELINDA IS THE SAME SORT OF SITUATION 
SHE'S QUITE A DOMINEERING GIRL 
RICKY ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT 
AND HE'S JUST THERE WANTS AN EASY LIFE WORKING FOR HER DAD 
AND IN ALBERT SQUARE RICKY HAS ONE LAST ACT TO PERFORM FOR HIS FATHER 
FOURTEEN POINT OH SIX SCENE TWENTY ONE FIRST PASS TAKE ONE RIGHT STAND BY AND ACTION 
WHERE SHALL I PUT 'EM IT DON'T REALLY MATTER LOVE 
HE JUST SAID IN THE GARDENS YEAH BUT WHERE 
WHAT ON THE GRASS ON THE PATH UNDER ARTHUR'S BENCH WHY NOT THE FLOWERBED 
THE SCENE NOW IS JUST A. 
THEY BRING THE URN TO US WITH FRANK'S ASHES AND WE'RE SORT OF 
SCATTERING THE ASHES BUT BEING RICKY I WANNA GET IT RIGHT 
NOW WHAT I'M JUST CHECKING WHAT WHICH WAY THE WIND'S BLOWING 
WE DON'T WANT IT BLOWING BACK ON US DO WE OH FOR HEAVEN SAKES LOOK I CAN'T SEE LIAM 
MELINDA'S IN A STROP JANINE'S GONE A. W. O. L. GETTING A GOBFUL OF ME DAD ON TOP WOULD REALLY ROUND THINGS OFF 
WALKING BACK ON THE LOT FOR THE FIRST TIME WAS QUITE STRANGE 
YOU KNOW ONCE YOU DO YOUR FIRST SCENE YOU HAVEN'T GOT TIME TO BE NERVOUS 
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE NERVOUS BUT ONCE YOU RUN IT AND THEN SEE EVERYONE AGAIN 
YOU KNOW YOU'VE JUST GOT TO GET ON WITH YOUR JOB 
SO NO IT'S NICE O. K. THANK YOU 
TAKE ONE THEN STAND BY 
AND ACTION 
GETTING A GOBFUL OF ME DAD ON TOP WOULD REALLY ROUND THINGS OFF 
IT'S QUITE A SENTIMENTAL LITTLE MOMENT REALLY ALSO HAVING DIANE THERE MY SISTER 
SHE HASN'T BEEN HERE FOR ELEVEN YEARS FRANK WRITES A WILL AND THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS HE REQUESTS 
HIS ASHES ARE SCATTERED IN THE SQUARE 
ARTHUR FOWLER'S BENCH IS THERE AND APPARENTLY THERE'S A TREE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE 
SO OBVIOUSLY HALF THE CAST MEMBERS ARE SOMEWHERE IN THE SQUARE 
AND WITH FRANK BUTCHER LAID TO REST WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR RICKY AND BIANCA 
I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT RICKY AND BIANCA COMING BACK 
THIS WHOLE NEW SIDE OF BIANCA WE SEE HER AS A MOTHER 
SHE'S GOT A CLUSTER OF KIDS ALL DIFFERENT AGES 
I THINK THAT BIANCA IS WELL ON HER WAY TO BECOMING A FULL BLOWN PROPER EASTENDERS MATRIARCH 
IT WON'T BE A SMOOTH RIDE THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS A REAL DING DONG BETWEEN THEM 
WHETHER TRUE LOVE WILL OUT FOR THEM I THINK ONLY TIME WILL TELL 
I DON'T THINK THEY'LL RUSH THEM BACK TOGETHER RICKY AND BIANCA WILL ALWAYS GET ON 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOT A SON TOGETHER I THINK THEY WERE THEIR FIRST EACH OTHER'S TRUE LOVES 
AND THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A CHEMISTRY NO MATTER WHAT 
OH SEE THAT GIRL 
SHE DOES SOMETHING TO MY CHEMISTRY 
WHEN I'M CLOSE I'M SURE 
SHE RAISE MY TEMPERATURE BY THREE DEGREES 
FOR WE'VE GOT A GOOD THING GOING 
A REAL GOOD GOING YEAH 
THAT GIRL AND ME
