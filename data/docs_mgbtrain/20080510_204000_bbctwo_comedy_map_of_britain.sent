WHERE SHY AND DIFFIDENT FOLK LIKE GEOFF BOYCOTT AND BRIAN CLOUGH HAVE ALL PLIED THEIR TRADE 
ON THE CITY OUTSKIRTS IS THE REGIONAL STATION OF RADIO AIRE 
WHERE ANOTHER RETIRING TYPE SET OUT ON THE ROAD TO RADIO FAME 
BECOMING THE SELF PROCLAIMED SAVIOUR OF RADIO ONE 
TYPICAL YORKSHIRE MODESTY 
THIS IS THE WONDERFUL RADIO AIRE WHICH WAS THE FIRST RADIO STATION 
I EVER WORKED AT HERE IN LEEDS WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD 
I'M GOING TO MEET THE MAN WHO HELPED ME START OFF IN RADIO 
ALTHOUGH WHEN I WAS HERE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A HELICOPTER WHICH IT SEEMS TO HAVE NOW 
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S SATURDAY MORNING AGAIN THIS IS MAGIC EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT 
HELLO I'M HERE TO SEE MR. CARL KINGSTON YEAH JUST GO THROUGH 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I HAVE TO DO IN THE NEXT THIRTY SECONDS IS MAKE A NICE CUP OF EARL GREY TEA 
HELLO HOW ARE YOU SUPERMAN THERE 
WHEN I MET CHRIS HE WAS VERY VERY SHY AS A TWELVE YEAR OLD THIRTEEN YEAR OLD 
VERY VERY QUIET NOTHING LIKE HE IS NOW 
THIS HAS CHANGED A LOT SINCE I WAS LAST HERE AS A KID 
THIS CORRIDOR SMELLS BY THE WAY 
HIS MUM HAD ASKED COULD CHRIS COME TO THE STUDIO 
HE WAS REFERRED TO AS A HELPER HE USED TO HELP ME ON THE PROGRAMME 
WE WORKED OUT IF YOU GOT A RECORD SLEEVE AND SLID IT HERE YOU COULD GET THE LOCK UNLOCKED 
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO IT NOTHING'S LOCKED THESE DAYS 
EVERYTHING WILL GET NICKED 
WHERE IS HE HA HA HA HA 
YOU ARE NOT STILL ON THE AIR ARE YOU I'M STILL ON THE AIR NOT RETIRED YET 
GOOD TO SEE YOU AND YOU I THOUGHT YOU'D COME TO GET A FEW C. D.'S OUT OF ME 
REMEMBER THESE I NICKED MOST OF THEM WHEN I LEFT 
I'D ALWAYS WANTED TO WORK IN RADIO I ALWAYS WANTED TO WORK HERE 
I'M A LEEDS LAD AND THIS IS THE STATION FOR LEEDS 
THE THING IS YOU MADE IT SEEM SO COOL WORKING IN RADIO COS YOU HAD A CAR WITH YOUR NAME DOWN THE SIDE 
I GOT THEM ALL STOLEN THOUGH YOU WOULD HERE 
WHEN I WAS ON THE AIR HERE CHRIS WOULD HAVE SAT EXACTLY IN FRONT OF ME HERE STARING AT ME 
WITH A PAIR OF HEADPHONES ON I SUPPOSE REALLY HANGING ON MY EVERY WORD 
I USED TO ANSWER CARL'S PHONES IN THERE 
ALL GIRLS YEAH 
HAVE YOU GOT ME A WINNER 
I ALWAYS WANTED TO GET A JOB HERE 
AND I WORKED HERE WORKED 
I ANSWERED THE PHONES AND MADE TEA FOR FREE 
EVERYBODY ALWAYS SAYS CHRIS MOYLES I USED TO EMPLOY HIM 
THEY DIDN'T EMPLOY ME AT ALL I DIDN'T GET ANY MONEY 
GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO TOPSHOP AND TOPMAN 
THE LEADING EDGE OF FASHION AND THE CUTTING EDGE OF MUSIC 
TOPSHOP WAS EVERYONE HAS SOMEWHERE TO START 
THAT WAS I SUPPOSE MY FIRST PAID JOB 
IN TOPSHOP LEEDS THE D. J. BOX USED TO BE ABOVE HERE 
CHRIS LIKED THE LADIES 
THE IDEA WAS YOU ENTERTAINED THE CUSTOMERS WITH YOUR BANTER AND SUBLIMINAL SELLING STYLE 
WITHIN THE SPACE BETWEEN ONE RECORD AND ANOTHER 
YOU WERE ENGAGING THE AUDIENCE 
AND TELLING THEM ABOUT SOME OF THE FABULOUS PRODUCT THAT TOPSHOP AND TOPMAN HAD 
THIS IS THE INNOVATION THIS IS THE CUTTING EDGE 
I COULDN'T BE ARSED WITH THAT I USED TO PLAY A LOT OF RECORDS FOR ALL OF THE STAFF AND DICK ABOUT 
HE WOULD TALK ABOUT CUSTOMERS WHEN THEY CAME IN THE SHOP AS WELL 
HE WOULD MAKE SARCASTIC COMMENTS OR JIBES 
I KNEW THAT HANG ON HE'S ONLY A YOUNG LAD SIXTEEN 
I COULD PROBABLY HIRE HIM QUITE CHEAPLY AND I DID 
RADIO AIRE 
THIS IS WHERE I DID MY FIRST SHOW 
YEAH YOU DID YOUR SHOW THROUGH THERE 
WE'VE GOT A CLIP OF YOUR SHOW YOU HAVEN'T WE HAVE 
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT ARE YOU SURE YEAH 
SHALL I PLAY IT IT WILL BE RUBBISH 
I FINALLY GOT MY OWN SHOW HERE AND I DID GET PAID I THOUGHT I'D MADE IT 
IT'S KIND OF LIKE BEING A FOOTBALLER AND PLAYING FOR YOUR LOCAL TEAM 
IS THAT WHITNEY HOUSTON 
IF YOU'RE A REGULAR LISTENER TO CARL KINGSTON'S EVENING PIECE BETWEEN SEVEN AND TEN 
YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE CONTINUING SAGAS OF STEVE AND LIZ 
CARL USUALLY UPDATES YOU EVERY OTHER NIGHT THAT'S MY FAKE LAUGH 
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS WHERE I STARTED AND I'VE A LOT OF AFFECTION FOR THIS RADIO STATION 
THIS STUDIO AND THE BUILDING IT'S STILL COMPETITION 
AND SO THERE'S AN EVIL SIDE OF ME THAT LOVES THE FACT THAT 
I HAVE MORE LISTENERS THAN THIS PLACE DOES IN THE MORNING 
HI TO LIZ AND STEVE AND JUST LOOK IF YOU SEE THEM 
IT'S CRINGEWORTHY BUT I WAS SIXTEEN 
IT WAS GREAT NINETY SIX POINT THREE MORE MUSIC 
I SOUND BETTER THERE 
MAGIC LISTENER CLUB BIRTHDAYS THAT'S ALL THEIR LISTENERS BY THE WAY 
IT'S LIKE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN A ROUGH COUNCIL ESTATE AND YOU'VE COME BACK TO HAVE A LITTLE LOOK 
IT'S NICE TO SEE EVERYTHING AGAIN BUT YOU WANNA GO BECAUSE YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE WHEELS ON THE CAR 
I THINK THIS IS NOW NETWORKED FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE 
THIS IS A RADIO STUDIO THIS IS A RADIO STATION IN THIS ROOM 
BUT THERE'S NO ONE HERE BECAUSE IT'S NETWORKED 
AND I THINK 
THEY WERE DISCOVERED AT THEIR HOUSE 
IF I DO THAT IT TAKES IT OFF THE AIR 
OH THAT'S POWER ISN'T IT 
POWER THERE I WOULD LIKE TO NICK SOMETHING BEFORE I GO THOUGH 
THERE WILL BE A COUPLE OF OLD DEARS IN BURMANTOFTS GOING OH THE RADIO'S GONE OFF 
STEVIE WINWOOD NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWELVE IF THAT'S COMING UP ON MAGIC 
IT'S NOT GONNA BE PLAYED BECAUSE I'VE GOT IT 
THAT'S ME I'LL DO IT AGAIN IT'S OFF 
BACK ON AGAIN 
RIGHT LET'S GET OUT OF HERE SERIOUSLY 
THIS RADIO STATION KEEPS GOING OFF MATE 
JUST ALONG THE COASTAL ROAD THE HOME OF YORKSHIRE TELEVISION 
STANDS ON THE SITE OF AN OLD SHIRT FACTORY 
IT WAS HERE THAT CAROL VORDERMAN AND RICHARD WHITELEY 
SPENT TWENTY THREE YEARS STRUGGLING WITH EVERYONE'S CONSONANTS 
BUT BEFORE RICHARD PRESENTED COUNTDOWN HE FACED ANOTHER CONUNDRUM 
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN A FERRET DOESN'T REALISE IT'S ON CAMERA 
AND WHAT'S MORE ON CALENDAR YTV'S PERENNIAL SIX O'CLOCK MAGAZINE SHOW 
YOU LIVED LIKE THIS FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS YES WHEREABOUTS WAS THIS 
WAS THIS IN YORKSHIRE LICHFIELD 
OW OW OW I'M SORRY OW 
THIS ISN'T THE ACTUAL ORIGINAL STUDIO BUT ONE EXACTLY THE SAME 
I GUESS 
RICHARD WOULD HAVE BEEN SITTING HERE SOMEWHERE 
BRIAN PLUMBER WOULD HAVE BEEN SITTING THERE JUGGLING FERRETS 
OW OW OW I'M SORRY OW 
IT'S ALL RIGHT LET IT GO 
HE LOVED HIS FERRET 
OW PUT IT ON THE FLOOR IT WON'T HURT YOU 
IT IS HURTING ME 
THAT WAS IN THE DAYS WHEN HE WAS REALLY POMPOUS 
HE WAS I'M A POLITICAL REPORTER AND I AM THE ANCHOR 
AS WE USED TO SAY OF THE LOCAL NEWS PROGRAMME AND THAT WAS WHAT REALLY MADE IT FUNNY 
BECAUSE HE WAS SO DESPERATELY TRYING TO KEEP IT IN CHECK THE STIFF UPPER LIP AND ALL THAT 
PUT IT DOWN 
IF YOU JUST HOLD ON TO MINE I CAN'T HOLD ON TO ANYTHING 
EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS HILARIOUS YOU CAN HEAR THEM LAUGHING IN THE BACKGROUND 
THIS MUST BE THE CLIMAX OF THE SITUATION 
HE SAID THAT HURT THAT REALLY HURT 
LOOK AT THE SCARS LOOK AT THE SCARS 
I DID GO DON'T BE PATHETIC 
WHILE THIS INCIDENT WAS GOING ON WE HAD THIS FULL TIME NURSE 
IN FACT ONE OF A TEAM WATCHING THE PROGRAMME GO OUT LIVE 
SHE WAS ALWAYS ALERT FOR ANY KIND OF CRISIS 
SHE MARCHED IN TROUSERS DOWN WHITELEY 
WHACK IN WENT THE OLD INJECTION HE DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE ABOUT IT 
THANK YOU IF THAT HAD MEANT BUSINESS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THROUGH TO THE BONE SHE'S PLAYING WITH YOU 
REALLY SHE CAN COME AROUND AND PLAY ANY TIME 
PEOPLE WHEREVER HE WENT TALKED ABOUT THE FERRET 
HE HAS TRAVELLED THE WORLD ON THE FERRET 
NOT LITERALLY ON THE FERRET 
BUT THIS CLIP WENT EVERYWHERE 
IT WAS REALLY POPULAR IN AUSTRALIA APPARENTLY THEY LOVED TO WATCH IT 
I THINK HE GOT THREE HOLIDAYS IN AUSTRALIA FREE 
BEING A YORKSHIREMAN IT WAS THE FREE BIT HE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN 
THAT ISN'T A BITE THAT'S A GAME 
THAT'S A GAME IS IT THAT'S A PLAY 
WHEN THE GRIM REAPER ARRIVES THE OBITS WON'T SAY PERCEPTIVE T. V. INTERVIEWER DIES 
OR POPULAR PARLOUR GAME AFTERNOON T. V. HOST DIES 
IT'LL BE FERRET MAN DIES 
IF THAT HAD MEANT BUSINESS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THROUGH TO THE BONE 
SHE'S PLAYING WITH YOU REALLY YES SHE CAN COME AROUND AND PLAY ANY TIME 
APPARENTLY THE HANDLER COULD CLAIM TEN PER CENT OF EVERYTHING THE FERRET SANK ITS TEETH INTO 
CONTINUING ALONG THE COASTAL ROAD WE REACH BRITAIN'S DOUBLE BARRELLED AIRPORT LEEDS BRADFORD 
WHERE COMEDY DUO HALE AND PACE SPOTTED A GAP IN THE MARKET FOR A REGIONAL AIRLINE 
OFF ON YOUR HOLS 
DON'T KNOW WHO TO FLY WITH

INTERNATIONAL CUISINE IS OF THE HIGHEST STANDARD 
YORKSHIRE AIRLINES DEPARTING LEEDS INTERNATIONAL AIRSTRIP 
TOUCHING DOWN TWENTY MINUTES LATER AT LEEDS INTERNATIONAL AIRSTRIP

I KNOW WE'VE ONLY JUST STARTED BUT IT MIGHT BE PRUDENT TO STOP 
IN GUISELEY FOR SOME FISH AND CHIPS FOR THIS IS WHERE HARRY RAMSDEN STARTED TO BUILD HIS EMPIRE 
ABOVE ANOTHER GUISELEY CHIP SHOP AN ASPIRING YOUNG CLASSICAL PIANIST HARRY CORBETT DREAMT OF A CONCERT 
CAREER UNTIL A LOSS OF HEARING MADE HIM LOOK FOR ANOTHER WAY 
OF USING HIS MANUAL DEXTERITY AND A KIDS' COMEDY HERO WAS BORN

WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH BATTER 
SHOP CAN I HAVE A FISH AND FOUR PENN'ORTH AND A BAG OF SCRAPS PLEASE 
I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE YOU BROUGHT ME HERE WHERE MY GRANDMOTHER WAS SERVING CHIPS 
IT WAS HERE IN THIS FISH AND CHIP SHOP 
THAT MY FATHER ATE FISH AND CHIPS EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE 
DON'T BE LIKE THAT 
KIDS IDENTIFIED WITH SOOTY 
SOOTY WAS THEM 
SOOTY WAS THE LITTLE PERSON WHO COULD GET AWAY WITH MURDER AND HE FREQUENTLY DID 
WHERE DID THAT GO 
GENERATION AFTER GENERATION LOVES A TEDDY BEAR 
BUT NONE OF US HAD A TEDDY BEAR QUITE LIKE SOOTY 
I SAY SOOTY OOH 
HE'S SORRY IT'S ALL RIGHT BEING SORRY BUT WHAT ABOUT MY EYE 
AND THERE HE IS NOW SOOTY 
WHAT DO YOU DO YOU WAVE TO CAMERA 
MARVELLOUS I REALLY DON'T MIND HOW YOU DO IT IT'S FABULOUS 
ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING SOOTY WOULD MAKE A LITTLE NOISE AND HARRY WOULD SAY SOOTY 
HE WOULD GO LIKE THAT THE SLAPPING NOISE WAS FANTASTIC 
HE WOULD SAY I NOD MY HEAD 
AND WHEN I NOD MY HEAD YOU HIT IT GO 
OH NO SOOTY NO 
STOP IT SOOTY 
PLEASE 
WE IMAGINED WHAT SOOTY WAS SAYING TO HARRY BECAUSE WE NEVER HEARD SOOTY 
IF HE CAME IN REALLY EXCITED LIKE THIS YOU THINK SOMETHING'S HAPPENED 
AND THEN YOU KNOW IF HE HAD DONE SOMETHING REALLY BAD THE PAW WOULD SWEEP THE TABLE TOP 
OH DEAR I'VE BEEN A BAD LITTLE TEDDY BEAR 
OH 
HARRY NEVER TOOK THE VIEW 
THAT SOOTY WAS A PIECE OF CLOTH 
SOOTY WAS A REAL TEDDY BEAR 
I DON'T WANT ANY SWEETS 
WHEN SOOTY MADE PERSONAL APPEARANCES IT WOULD BE IN A SPECIALLY MADE BOX 
MY FATHER ACTUALLY IT'S A BIT EMBARRASSING THIS 
HE DID IN FACT PUT AIR HOLES IN THE BOX 
SOOTY COME OUT OF THERE 
HARRY WAS SOOTY'S DAD SOOTY WAS THE THIRD SON 
DAVID MATTHEW AND SOOTY BYE BYE EVERYONE 
MY FATHER WAS A RAVING LUNATIC WASN'T HE HE WAS 
I'M DESTROYED NOW 
WAVE BYE BYE 
THANK YOU SOOTY 
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE YES I'M GLAD 
TEN MILES DOWN THE A SIX FIFTY EIGHT WE APPROACH BRADFORD HOME OF THE ALHAMBRA 
ONE OF THE GREAT VARIETY THEATRES 
IT WAS HERE THAT A YOUNG ERNIE WISEMAN FIRST HEARD FAINT APPLAUSE 
NOT LONG BEFORE HE MET JOHN BARTHOLOMEW AND TOGETHER THEY FORMED 
ONE OF THE OUR GREATEST COMEDY DOUBLE ACTS MORECOMBE AND WISE 
THE OTHER ONE WITH THE SHORT FAT HAIRY LEGS 
THIS IS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN FOR MY HUSBAND ERNIE WISE THE ALHAMBRA BRADFORD 
THIS IS THE STORY OF A MAN 
A MAN OF DIGNITY A MAN OF GREAT EDUCATION LIKE WHAT NO OTHER MEN HAVE GOT 
HE BELONGED TO THE TELEGRAPH AND ARGOS CONCERT PARTY 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TO ME NO 
YOU ARE THE LEONARDO D. A. VINCI OF THE FELT TIP 
HE HAD CLOGS AND DID THE TAP DANCING CLOGS WE USED TO CALL HIM THE THUNDERING HERD WHEN HE DID IT 
HE USED TO CALL HIMSELF THE PERFORMING SEAL BECAUSE HE HAS ALWAYS WORKED SINCE THE AGE OF SIX 
I DON'T GO IN FOR SELF ANALYSIS BUT I'M JUST GRATEFUL AND VERY HUMBLE THAT I'M A GENIUS 
OOH A LITTLE BOX 
MY GOODNESS 
IT DOESN'T LOOK TO HAVE CHANGED VERY MUCH 
BEAUTIFUL 
I WAS APPEARING IN SOME REVIEWS AT THE ALHAMBRA BRADFORD EVERY YEAR A SORT OF BIG EXTRAVAGANZA 
I WAS IN MY ELEMENT THERE 
THAT WAS MY FIRST REAL TASTE OF WHAT WE WOULD SAY PROPER SHOW BUSINESS 
WE ARE LOOKING AT A PICTURE WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY THE SIZE OF ERNIE THAT LITTLE FELLA THERE 
IN ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR NINETEEN THIRTY SIX TIME HE WOULD BE ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD THERE I WOULD THINK 
HE'S WEARING A VERY BRIGHT CHECK SUIT WHEN THE BOYS WORE CHECK SUITS LATER IN THEIR CAREER 
THEY ALWAYS CALLED THEM THE B. B. C. SUIT BECAUSE IT WAS SMALL CHEQUES 
ANY SUCCESS THAT I'VE HAD I'VE GOT THROUGH MY OWN NATURAL ABILITY WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
IT WAS ME THAT TOOK YOU OUT OF THAT THIRD RATE MUSIC HALL WHEN YOU WERE BEING SAWN IN HALF 
UNFORTUNATELY I GOT THERE A LITTLE TOO LATE THAT'S ALL 
I REMEMBER COMING ON AND DOING LAMBETH WALK WITH A DONKEY 
AND VIVIDLY REMEMBERING THE DAMN THING WOULDN'T COME ON 
I CAN REMEMBER TRYING TO PULL IT ON BECAUSE I CAME ON AND DID ANY TIME YOU'RE LAMBETH WAY 
OH WHAT RUBBISH 
I PLAYED THAT WITH ERNIE FOR ERNIE 
BUT I PLAYED IT BETTER THEN 
HE WAS ALWAYS MEANT TO BE AN ENTERTAINER 
HIS MOTHER WAS A MARVELLOUS PIANIST AND A VERY GOOD SINGER 
SO WAS HIS SISTER ANNIE 
SHE PLAYED ON CHILDREN'S HOUR B. B. C. HIS FATHER WAS A VERY GOOD ENTERTAINER 
THE STRIPPER 
ERNIE HE WAS A HOOFER 
HE WAS A DANCER AND HE HAD THE RIGHT SCHOOLING 
I CAN REMEMBER ERNIE SAYING TO ME HOW ABOUT MAKING A ROUTINE WHERE 
WE'RE MAKING BREAKFAST AND WE DO IT ALL TO MUSIC 
D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. DUM 
D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. DUM 
I'D SAY COME IN ONE COME IN TWO FORWARD A BIT 
AND THERE AND THAT MUST HAVE BEEN WHERE ERNIE WAS 
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE EXACT SPOT TO DO THE WAVING BIT 
GOODBYE BEAUTIFUL 
A LITTLE WAY ALONG THE M. SIXTY TWO WE'RE IN WAKEFIELD 
HOME GROUND OF CRUISE CROONER JANE MCDONALD 
AND ALSO HELEN FIELDING 
AUTHOR OF THAT GUIDE FOR AMBITIOUS CAREER GIRLS BRIDGET JONES' DIARY 
BUT OUR DESTINATION IS EVEN HUMBLER IT'S THE TOWN'S LABOUR CLUB 
A SIMPLE CONVERTED HUT WHERE A POLITICALLY MINDED MISCHIEF MAKER FIRST SAW THE LIGHT 
I'M TRYING TO GET THIS OUT TO A FRIEND OF MINE IN BAGHDAD 
OUR FIRST VISIT TO THE HOME OF WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE 
HE WAS AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE 
WHEN HE MET WITH ALAN CLARK AND LORD TREFGARNE TO RELAX THE GUIDELINES ON ARMS TO IRAQ 
YOU'RE PRETTY NEAR THE LIBEL LAWS AND IT'S A STUPID STUNT AND YOU'D BETTER GO AWAY 
WELCOME TO WAKEFIELD AND WELCOME TO THE RED SHED 
OVER HERE YOU HAVE WAKEY MARKET OVER HERE YOU HAVE RED SHED 
THIS PLACE IT JUST LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD BE OWNED BY SOMEBODY WITH WEIRD OBSESSIONS 
IT LOOKS LIKE FRED DIBNAH MIGHT BE COLLECTING THINGS WITHIN IT 
ACTUALLY THIS PLACE WAS THE HEART OF TRADE UNIONISM IN WAKEFIELD 
ANYONE INVOLVED IN ANY PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT WOULD BE THERE 
IT WAS A SORT OF PLACE FOR MEETING FOR PLOTTING FOR HATCHING AND FOR SOCIALISING 
AND THIS WAS WHERE I DID MY FIRST GIGS 
VOTE FOR MARK THOMAS BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU I WILL HIT JEREMY BEADLE IN THE FACE 
AM I GETTING ARRESTED 
THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED THE CONCERT ROOM 
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU HELLO 
HERE WE GO THROUGH HERE 
AND THIS 
THIS IS THE MIGHTY CONCERT ROOM 
YOU CAN SEE IT'S NOT HUGE 
WE USED TO MOVE EVERYTHING BACK WE USED THIS AREA AS A STAGE AREA 
THEN EVERYONE USED TO SIT AROUND ON THE TABLES 
IF WE'D DONE REALLY WELL WE'D PUT SOME CHAIRS IN THE MIDDLE 
WHICH SHOWED WE'D DONE REALLY WELL FOR THE BENEFIT 
IT WASN'T JUST LIKE THERE ARE SOME MINERS AND THEY ARE ON STRIKE 
AND WE OUGHT TO SUPPORT THEM 
THESE WERE PEOPLE WE KNEW THESE WERE MATES 
WE USED TO PUT ON SHOWS TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE MINERS 
BUT WE ALSO USED TO GO AND WE'D PERFORM IN SOUP KITCHENS WHICH WAS JUST NUTS 
IT WAS JUST NUTS 
BECAUSE PEOPLE WANTED TO GET ON WITH THE GRUB ACTUALLY 
PEOPLE WERE JUST LOOK WE'RE IN A SOUP KITCHEN MATE 
WE'RE JUST HERE TO EAT OUR FOOD AND MOVE 
WE'RE DOING IT BECAUSE WE HAVE NO OTHER OPTION 
PEOPLE WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE AND VERY SWEET 
THEY HAD THIS KIND OF LIKE AHH THE STUDENTS ARE HERE 
BLESS 'EM 
GO ON YOU OUGHT TO GO IN AND GIVE THEM A BIT OF SUPPORT THEY'RE TRYING HARD 
SO WHILE I WAS DOING ALL OF THIS STUFF AT WAKEFIELD IN THE RED SHED 
THE HOTBED OF POLITICAL DISSENT AND FIRE 
THIS IS WHERE I WENT TO COLLEGE WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE 
IS A SLIGHT REMOVE FROM THE ENVIRONS OF THE RED SHED 
THERE WERE PARTS OF THE COLLEGE THAT JUST REALLY LIVED UP TO 
THAT REPUTATION OF SHOES AND SOCKS OFF LET'S BE TREES WHICH WAS FANTASTIC 
WHERE WE'RE GOING NOW IS A FOLLY 
IT'S A CLASSICAL GREEK DESIGN I BELIEVE 
IT WAS A PLACE THAT WAS USED FOR PERFORMANCES OF GREEK TRAGEDIES 
YOU BEGAN AT SIX HUNDRED A M. AND WE WOULD HAVE IN OCTOBER TORCH LIGHT PROCESSIONS FROM THE MANSION 
THAT WOULD COME ALL OF THE WAY UP HERE AND PEOPLE WOULD THEN PERFORM 
STUDENTS WOULD BE DRESSED UP IN CLASSICAL COSTUME AS IT WERE 
THE ROBES BASICALLY TOGAS 
HERE WOULD BE THE BIG ACTION 
ER PEOPLE FINDING OUT THEY'VE SLEPT WITH THE DAUGHTER 
ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF WOULD BE HAPPENING HERE PLUCKING THEIR EYES OUT 
OVER HERE THERE WOULD BE A SORT OF ASSEMBLED THRONG 
OF PEOPLE BLEARY EYED GOING GOD PAUL LOOKS REALLY FUNNY IN THAT RUG 
SO THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN 
WITHOUT COMING TO BRETTON HALL I WOULDN'T BE DOING WHAT I DO 
IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT THE PRACTICAL THINGS 
IT WAS ABOUT THE ACADEMIC STUFF AND THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN APPROACH SOMETHING AND TELL STORIES THROUGH 
AND TELL STORIES WHICH ARE CURRENT STORIES THAT ARE FACTUAL THAT ARE ABOUT DOCUMENTARY THINGS 
BECAUSE I'M OBSESSED WITH CLASS COS I'M MIDDLE CLASS NOW 
I USED TO BE WORKING CLASS BECAME MIDDLE CLASS 
IT IS SO MUCH BETTER IT'S REALLY NICE 
OH I'VE GOT LOADS OF C. D.'S IT'S FANTASTIC 
FRESH HERBS IN MY GARDEN ISN'T THAT BRILLIANT 
WE ARE SO MIDDLE CLASS WE'RE THINKING OF VOTING LABOUR 
MARK WAS A DRAMA STUDENT AT BRETTON SO HE WAS VERY LEFT BANK WHEN HE ARRIVED 
IT'S A VERY PASTORAL IDYLL IS BRETTON AND THERE WASN'T A LOT OF POLITICS GOING ON THERE 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS THE MINERS' STRIKE C. N. D. WAS VERY BIG ANTI APARTHEID 
ANTI APARTHEID 
CUBA NICARAGUA ALL OF THAT KIND OF BUSINESS GOING ON 
SO WE DID A NUMBER OF AGIT PROP DRAMA THINGS TO RAISE MONEY FOR DIFFERENT CAUSES REALLY 
THE WEIRD THING IS WHAT I DO NOW IS A MIXTURE OF JOURNALISM AND COMEDY 
AND THEATRE AND STAND UP AND YOU KNOW ACTIVISM 
IT DID START HERE THIS IS WHERE IT STARTED 
PETER FOUND THIS WHICH WAS THE MINUTES FROM 
A STUDENT UNION MEETING 
IT SAYS PETER HIRST SPOKE ABOUT A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THE PRINCIPAL 
MARK THOMAS PROPOSED THAT THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE BY OCCUPIED AT SOME POINT IN THE NEAR FUTURE 
IN THE COURSE OF OUR MEANDERINGS AROUND THE COMEDY MAP 
WE HAVE STOPPED OFF AT A NUMBER OF WORKING MEN'S CLUBS 
BUT THIS ONE'S THE DADDY OF THEM ALL THE BATLEY VARIETY CLUB 
IN THE SEVENTIES ONE CHARLIE WILLIAMS FORMER DONCASTER ROVERS CENTRE HALF WAS CROWNED KING OF BATLEY 
BELOW THAT TITLE HIS STYLE OF COMEDY TROD A FINE LINE 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT'S CHA A A A A ARLIE WILLIAMS 
IS THAT IN COLOUR 
OH YOU DESERVE TO STOP IN THIS COUNTRY 
I HOPE IT IS IF IT'S IN BLACK AND WHITE YOU'VE GOT A NEGATIVE 
THIS IS BATLEY VARIETY CLUB AS WAS FRONTIER NOW 
BUT THIS WAS THE MECCA OF THE NORTH FOR ENTERTAINMENT 
I MEAN SOME OF THE STARS THAT THEY HAD HERE WERE JUST INCREDIBLE 
OF COURSE THE GREAT MAN HIMSELF CHARLIE CHARLIE WILLIAMS HE WAS THE KING OF BATLEY 
OUR OLD LADY USED TO SAY THERE'S NOWT WRONG WITH RIGHT FOLK THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE INNIT 
AND WE'RE YORKSHIRE WELL I AM I CAN'T VOUCH FOR YOU 
THE FIRST TIME I SAW CHARLIE WAS I WOULD THINK ABOUT SIXTY SEVEN SIXTY EIGHT 
HE WAS QUITE A GOOD NAME IN THE WORKING MEN'S CLUBS IN THESE DAYS 
PEOPLE USED TO FOLLOW HIM AROUND BECAUSE HE WAS UNUSUAL 
HE WAS THE ONLY BLACK MAN IN THIS AREA 
SO WHEN HE WAS ON STAGE YOU KNOW THEY USED TO BE ASKING ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS 
OH WHERE HAVE YOU COME FROM 
AND ER I COME FROM YORKSHIRE 
HE SAID ARE THA REALLY YORKSHIRE I SAID AYE BUT KEEP IT DARK 
IF CHARLIE WAS ANYTHING LIKE ME AND I SUSPECT HE WAS 
YOU USED YOUR COLOUR AS A DEFENCE MECHANISM TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU 
AM I YORKSHIRE 
EH THA CAN'T BUY CLASS CAN THA 
BECAUSE AS OFTEN AS WE HEAR THE SAYING DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER PEOPLE DID BACK THEN 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I'D LIKE TO SAY HOW PLEASED I AM TO BE IN RHODESIA 
THIS IS A WONDERFUL COUNTRY 
I LIKE IT I HOPE YOU LIKE IT 
AND IF I HAVE ANY BOTHER FROM YOU LOT I'LL TAKE IT BACK 
HE SAID EVERYBODY'S THE SAME EVERYBODY INSIDE IS THE SAME 
SOME HAVE GOT DIFFERENT COLOUR SKIN OUTSIDE WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THAT 
HE NEVER MADE A BIG ISSUE OF IT 
YOU CAN HAVE IT I'VE ONLY COME OVER HERE JUST TO GET A TAN 
ANYBODY THAT'S EVER WORKED ON A FACTORY FLOOR OR A WAREHOUSE AS I'VE DONE OR ON A BUILDING SITE 
YOU KNOW THAT THINGS GO ON LIKE THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY 
CHARLIE DID IT IN A WAY THAT THEN WAS COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY ACCEPTABLE 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT'S THE COMEDIANS 
I'M A YORKSHIRE LAD YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT MANY OF US LEFT 
WE'RE A DYING RACE 
CHARLIE WILLIAMS WAS THE FIRST BLACK COMIC TO BREAK INTO MAINSTREAM BRITISH TELEVISION 
I SAW HIM WORKING IN A CLUB IN LEEDS TO START WITH 
AND LIKE HIS BLACK FACE AND HIS YORKSHIRE ACCENT WERE INCREDIBLE 
BUT I DIDN'T BOOK HIM BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK I BOOKED HIM BECAUSE HE WAS VERY FUNNY 
OPENED T'CAR DOOR FRIT MESEN TO DEATH 
THERE'S A BLOKE STOOD THERE THREE EYES NO ARMS ONE LEG 
I SAID AYE AYE AYE 
YOU LOOK ARMLESS HOP IN 
WHEN WE FIRST SAW HIM ON TELEVISION WE SAT LOOKING AND THINKING IT'S OUR CHARLIE ON TELEVISION 
IN'T HE DOING WELL 
LAUGH I NEVER THOUGHT ME TROUSERS WOULD DRY 
IT WAS A TREMENDOUS BREAKTHROUGH 
LENNY HENRY AND WHAT HAVE YOU COME ON AFTERWARDS 
BUT THEN PEOPLE USED TO TURN THE T. V. ON JUST TO SEE CHARLIE BECAUSE HE WAS A COLOURED COMEDIAN 
OH I'M GOOD 
I REALLY LOOKED UP TO CHARLIE 
WHAT HE'D DONE HE BROKE A BARRIER 
HE MADE IT ACCEPTABLE FOR PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF TO GO IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE 
I WAS AT THE GROSVENOR HOUSE HOTEL IN LONDON ON PARK LANE 
GROSVENOR HOUSE HOTEL A VERY POSH 
HE WAS A PATH FINDER REALLY I'M NOT SURE PEOPLE REALISE JUST HOW IMPORTANT HE WAS 
BECAUSE HE OPENED UP EVERYTHING TO BLACK PERFORMERS EVERYWHERE PARTICULARLY COMEDIANS 
I WALKED OUT ON STAGE AND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE STOOD UP EN BLOC 
THEY THOUGHT IT WERE NELSON MANDELA 
UP HERE IT'S HARD TO AVOID THE M. ONE WHICH NOW TAKES US AS FAR AS ROTHERHAM 
WHERE FROM THE LOCAL SERVICES AT WOOLLY EDGE 
THERE'S A CLUE THAT THIS IS A TOWN WITH A PROUD HISTORY OF MOUSTACHES 
FROM LOCAL LADS DAVID SEAMAN AND PAUL SHANE TO TWO MOUSTACHIOED MAESTROS OF THE SMALL SCREEN

COULDN'T STOP A PIG IN A PASSAGE COULD YOU NO NO 
SOMETIMES WE RUN ERRANDS FOR THE FOLKS ABOUT THE GRANGE 
WITH A FIVE NOTE THEY TRUST US PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT'S STRANGE 
IN THE EARLY DAYS WE DID THAT COMEDY SONG AND DANCE 
THAT'S HOW WE STARTED COMEDY SONG AND DANCE 
WE DID A FEW GAGS OPENED WITH A SONG FINISHED WITH A TAP ROUTINE 
THEN WE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON ONE THING WE CONCENTRATED ON THE COMEDY ALONE 
C. H. C. H. CHUCKLEVISION C. H. CHUCKLEVISION 
C. H. C. H. CHUCKLEVISION 
TO ME TO YOU TO ME PAUL TO YOU THEN BARRY TO ME TO YOU 
STEADY STEADY NEARLY THERE GOOD 
TO ME TO YOU IS THAT IT YES 
I CAN SEE WHY THEY SAY PIANO MUSIC'S VERY MOVING NOW 
YOU'RE TELLING ME WHOA 
WE DIDN'T INTEND THAT TO BE A CATCHPHRASE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE WHEN MOVING FURNITURE 
WE WERE AT A FLAT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR THE SUMMER SEASON 
I WAS HAPPY TO MOVE IN SIT DOWN PUT THE TELLY OR RADIO ON 
BUT I'D HAVE TO HAVE IT HOW WE WANTED IT AND TIDY UP THE FURNITURE 
THAT SHOULD BE LIKE THAT I DO IT IN ME DRESSING ROOMS NOW 
HE DOES 
THOSE WERE THE DAYS EH THEY WERE 
OH THE STAGE MANAGER'S COMING QUICK QUICK 
HIYA TO YOU 
WE MOVE ON TO OUR DESTINATION CITY SHEFFIELD 
BIRTHPLACE OF PETER STRINGFELLOW 
THAT LIVING EMBODIMENT OF THE MIDLIFE CRISIS 
POP SENSATIONS THE ARCTIC MONKEYS ARE ALSO FROM THESE PARTS 
BUT IT'S A FAIR BET THEY DON'T BELIEVE STRINGFELLOW LOOKS TOO GOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR 
OUR STOP HERE IS TO HONOUR ANOTHER LEGEND OF THE MUSIC WORLD 
VERSATILE SINGER AND ORGANIST JOHN SHUTTLEWORTH 
HELLO THERE JOHN SHUTTLEWORTH HERE 
VERSATILE SINGER SLASH SONGWRITER FROM SHEFFIELD SOUTH YORKSHIRE 
BLIMEY WELL HERE WE ARE AT THE CROOKES WORKING MEN'S CLUB IN SHEFFIELD 
WHICH IS WHERE I USED TO WORK I THINK IN THE SUMMER OF SEVENTY SEVEN 
AFTER MY A LEVELS 
I THINK I GOT A LOT OF IDEAS FOR JOHN SHUTTLEWORTH FROM HERE 
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE BASEBALL CAPS THEN 
I WAS MADE REDUNDANT A FEW YEARS AGO AND WITH ME GOLDEN HANDSHAKE I BOUGHT AN ORGAN 
SINCE THEN I'VE SPENT ME DAYS WRITING SONGS HONING ME LYRICS 
SENDING ME TAPES OFF TO RECORD COMPANIES 
ER I'VE NOT HAD TOO MUCH SUCCESS TO DATE 
OOH THERE'S A PLAQUE HAS IT BEEN ERECTED IN MEMORY OF ME 
NO DEF LEPPARD 
OOH LET'S GO IN AND SEE IF WE CAN GET A PINT 
MY AUSTIN AMBASSADOR Y. REG Y. REG Y. REG 
MY AUSTIN AMBASSADOR Y. REG 
HELLO 
WORKING IN THIS WORKING MEN'S CLUB CERTAINLY HELPED TO SHAPE THE CHARACTER OF JOHN SHUTTLEWORTH 
THEY WERE ALWAYS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THE BEER 
JUST THAT KIND OF GETTING OVER SERIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING THAT ISN'T VERY IMPORTANT 
LIKE THE HEAD ON A PINT OF BEER 
CHEERS JOHN HERE'S TO THE TOUR CAREFUL KEN MIND ME SHOES SORRY 
YOU CERTAINLY CAN GRAHAM TO SEE IF I CAN STILL DO IT 
OH RIGHT I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO COME 
I THINK THE SORT OF CHAPS WHO COME TO WORKING MEN'S CLUBS 
THERE WAS A CLEAR DEMARCATION BETWEEN WORK AND LEISURE 
SO YOU PUT ON YOUR BEST CLOTHES AND YOU WOULD MAKE SURE THERE'S A GOOD CEASE DOWN THEM 
AND YOUR SHIRT WAS IMMACULATE 
AND YOU WOULD COME OUT AND I SUPPOSE LOOKING GOOD WAS PART OF THE EVENING AND PART OF HAVING FUN 
THIS IS WHERE I WAS THIS IS WHERE I STOOD 
THERE WAS A CHAP CALLED CURLY YES AND ANNE AND MARGARET TWO OLD DEARS 
ALL I REMEMBER WAS CURLY IT WAS ONE OF MY BEST IMPRESSIONS 
HE USED TO TELL YOU WHERE THE GLASSES SHOULD GO HE USED TO SAY PUT THAT THEER NOT THEER 
HALVES GO THEER PINTS GO THEER 
WAS THAT A GOOD IMPRESSION OH IT WAS 
WE'VE GOT A CUSTOMER LOOK WHAT DO YOU WANT 
I'D LIKE A DRINK PLEASE 
I'D LIKE A GLASS OF LAGER HALF A LAGER PLEASE 
JOHN SHUTTLEWORTH'S BEEN AROUND A HELL OF A LONG TIME ABOUT TWENTY TWO YEARS' 
TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO WAS WHEN I WAS MADE MY FIRST DEMO TAPE 
THAT'S A LADY'S GLASS ISN'T IT 
IN A GENTLEMAN'S GLASS 
IN FACT THERE'S A JOHN SHUTTLEWORTH SONG WHICH GOES 
AND PUBS AND CLUBS 
VERY POOR SERVICE HERE HE'S JUST YAKKING 
AND DOBERMAN PUPS 
A SHANDY BASS IN A LADY'S GLASS 
IN A LADY'S GLASS YEAH 
JOHN DOES IT BETTER THAN ME 
MY WIFE MARY MADE A LOVELY SHEPHERD'S PIE AND PEAS 
WITH CARROTS AND GRAVY OH AND CABBAGE AS AN ADDITIONAL GREEN 
I WAS TRYING TO BE A PROFESSIONAL SONG WRITER SO I WAS EXPOSED QUITE A LOT OF THESE BAD DEMO TAPES' 
I CAN'T EAT ANY MORE OF THIS SHEPHERD'S PIE MUM 
SO I DID MY OWN VERSION WITH JOHN SHUTTLEWORTH WHICH EVERYBODY LOVED 
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT MY BRILLIANTLY HONED SONGS ANY MORE 
BUT I CAN'T GO BACK TO SAVOURY NOW 
THAT SHEPHERD'S PIE WAS STUNNING 
BUT I'M HALF WAY THROUGH ME PUDDING 
ANYTHING THAT RHYMES REALLY I WILL RHYME 
I USUALLY START WITH A TITLE ONE CAME UP WITH THIS TITLE CEREAL CEREAL EATER 
CEREAL CEREAL EATER HOW DOES IT FEEL TO MEET HER 
CEREAL CEREAL EATER 
CORN FLAKES FROSTIES SUGAR PUFFS AND THAT NEW ONE OPTIVITA 
I'VE GOT AN AUSTIN AMBASSADOR Y. REG Y. REG Y. REG 
DON'T KEEP ASKING ME WHY REG IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE THAT YEAR 
VISUAL STIMULI 
BECAUSE I'M BEEN DOING JOHN PARTICULARLY FOR SO LONG 
I WAS STARTING TO GET A BIT HE'S AN OLD GEEZER WHO I DON'T REALLY LIKE 
PIGEONS IN FLIGHT 
I WANT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT SO I WENT TO SEE A HYPNOTIST 
I'VE HAD SOME HYPNOTHERAPY FANTASTIC 
IT'S WORKED A TREAT PIDGE PIGEON PIDGE I WANT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT 
THE HYPNOTIST SAID I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU GRAHAM I'M TALKING TO YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS 
YOU MUST ENJOY YOUR CREATIONS 
REVEL IN THEM AND ENJOY THEM 
IT IS YOUR RIGHT TO ENJOY THEM 
I REALISE I DO LIKE HIM 
I'M CATCHING HIM UP I DON'T HAVE TO PUT AS MUCH MAKE UP ON NOW 
PIGEON IN FLIGHT SOMETHING'S OUT OF KEY THERE WHO WAS THAT 
IT WAS YOU LAD 
I WANT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT 
TO BE ON A T. V. TALENT SHOW BACK IN THE SEVENTIES WAS A SHORTCUT TO THE TOP 
BEFORE SIMON COWELL CAME ALONG TO PROVE YOU DIDN'T NEED TALENT 
LES DAWSON LENNY HENRY AND VICTORIA WOOD ALL FOUND FAME ON NEW FACES 
AS DID A HOUSEWIFE FROM SHEFFIELD WHO TOOK SOME CONVINCING TO GO ON THE SHOW 
BUT ONCE THEY GOT THERE SHE NEVER LOOKED BACK 
I CAN REMEMBER MY WEDDING DAY AS IF IT WERE YESTERDAY I WISH IT WERE TOMORROW I WOULDN'T GO 
AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A PICTURE OF WHERE MARTI WAS WHEN I PHONED HER 
ABOUT THE AUDITION FOR NEW FACES 
WE CAN SAY THAT WAS THE NIGHT WHEN A STAR WAS MADE 
MY FIRST HUSBAND HE WAS A SNAPPY DRESSER 
WHENEVER HE BENT OVER SOMETHING SNAPPED 
OLDER MEN NEVER WENT INTO A CHEMIST SHOP AND HAD TO COME OUT WITH A PACKET OF RAZOR BLADES DID THEY 
THEY WERE CALLED WRANGLER JEANS YOU COULD SEE EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE WRANGLING 
MARTI CAINE WHEN I VERY FIRST MET HER WAS CALLED LYNN SHEPHERD 
WE LIVED IN SHEFFIELD AND WE STARTED SCHOOL TOGETHER 
I THINK WE WERE SOMETHING LIKE FIVE YEARS OLD 
WE NEVER EVER STOPPED LAUGHING BECAUSE FROM BEING TINY 
LYNN WAS ALWAYS THE CLOWN 
FOR SOME STRANGE REASON I USED TO ATTRACT LITTLE MEN 
I WAS NEVER SURE THEY WERE GOING TO DANCE OR CLIMB 
I WENT ALONG TO WHERE SHE LIVED IN SHEFFIELD 
THERE WAS THIS DRESS HANGING ON THE WALL AN EVENING DRESS 
AND SHE SAID I'M GOING TO GO ON THE CLUBS I NEED SOME MONEY 
I'VE SEEN THIS THREE PIECE SUITE IN WIGFALL'S WINDOW THERE WAS ONE MAN I WILL NEVER FORGET 
HE WAS FIVE FEET TALL AND WITHOUT A SINGLE HAIR ON HIS HEAD 
BALD AS A COOT 
HE ASKED ME TO DANCE HE LED ME MANFULLY ONTO THE FLOOR AND PULLED ME TO HIM 
THAT'S WHEN I LOOKED DOWN AND GOT THE BIGGEST FRIGHT OF MY LIFE 
YOU SEE I WAS WEARING A LOW CUT DRESS AND SUDDENLY I THOUGHT I'D GROWN ANOTHER ONE 
THE REASON SHE ACTUALLY WENT ON TO CLUBS WAS NOT TO FIND FAME 
AND FORTUNE BUT TO BUY A THREE PIECE SUITE FROM WIGFALL'S IN SHEFFIELD 
I'VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST MARRIAGE IT'S WONDERFUL I HAD A FAIRYTALE WEDDING GRIMM 
I FOUND MARTI AND I FOUND HER ACTUALLY HERE AT THIS HOUSE 
I SAID MARTI I WANT TO YOU DO THIS AUDITION FOR NEW FACES 
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING FOR NEW FACES 
WHAT DO I WANT TO GO ON TELEVISION FOR I'M NOT A TELEVISION ACT 
AFTER TALKING TO HER SHE SAID SHE WOULD GO THE FOLLOWING DAY 
THAT SAME NIGHT I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A PRODUCER 
WHO SAID CAN YOU PUT MARTI ON NEW FACES NEXT SATURDAY 
IT WAS THAT QUICK THIS HAPPENED 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN DIRECT FROM THE LONDON PALLADIUM 
A. T. V. BRING YOU THE NEW FACES ALL WINNERS' GALA FINAL 
PLEASE WELCOME MISS MARTI CAINE 
NEW FACES WAS AN INCREDIBLE PROGRAMME BECAUSE IN THOSE DAYS 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES THERE WAS ONLY B. B. C. ONE 
B. B. C. TWO AND I. T. V. 
REGULARLY BETWEEN FIVE THIRTY P. M. AND SIX HUNDRED P. M. 
ON A SATURDAY EVENING WE USED TO GET FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN MILLION VIEWERS 
MEMORIES 
SHE WAS MAGIC SHE LOOKED GREAT 
SHE HAD EXACTLY THE RIGHT ATTITUDE TO THE AUDIENCE 
SHE WAS WARM AND FRIENDLY 
WE ALL AGREED JUST SITTING HERE THAT SHE WAS THE STAR OF THE EVENING 
MISTY WATER COLOURED MEMORIES 
OF THE WAY 
OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO I CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
I CAN REMEMBER WATCHING IT AT HOME AND BURSTING INTO TEARS AT THE END OF IT 
PRETTY MUCH WHAT I FEEL LIKE DOING NOW 
I FIND IT REALLY REALLY MOVING 
SHE WAS JUST PHENOMENAL NO 
I'M EVER SO UNLUCKY I'M SO UNLUCKY 
GIRLS IF THEY EVER CUT MY HUBBY IN HALF I'D GET THE HALF THAT ATE 
WOMEN LOVED HER SHE DIDN'T ALIENATE HERSELF TO WOMEN 
LOOK AT THAT FOR A NOSE 
WHEN THEY WERE GIVING OUT NOSES I THOUGHT THEY SAID ROSES SO I ASKED FOR A BIG RED ONE LOOK AT THAT 
THE BOYS LOVED HER AND THE MUMS LOVED HER 
SHE HAD A VERY BIG AUDIENCE THERE 
THE ACT THAT GOES TO LAS VEGAS TO REPRESENT NEW FACES IS MARTI CAINE 
AFTER LYNN WON NEW FACES HER LIFE WAS TOTALLY TRANSFORMED 
AND ALL THOSE CLOTHES AND SHOES WE ALWAYS WANTED SHE COULD FINALLY HAVE 
I WANT YOU TO BEAR THIS IN MIND 
WHEN YOU THINK OF PAM I WAS IN THE CLOAKROOM WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS FIVE 
AND JANET ROEBUCK HAD A NEW HAT 
WITH FELT FLOWERS AROUND THE FRONT AND PAM RIPPED THEM OFF 
THE STRANGE THING IS THAT I WAS ALWAYS CONCERNED THAT I MIGHT GET LEFT BEHIND 
BUT I NEVER DID I WAS THERE TO WITNESS IT AND HELPED TO HIDE THE EVIDENCE 
WE WERE JUST TWO GIRLS FROM A SHEFFIELD COUNCIL ESTATE 
AND WHAT SHE ACHIEVED WAS JUST PHENOMENAL 
CHEERS PAL HAPPY FIFTIETH HERE'S TO THE NEXT FIFTY 
LET'S HOPE AS WE GET INTO AS MUCH TROUBLE AS WE DID LAST TIME 
I LOVE YOU VERY VERY MUCH 
THAT'S PRETTY SPECTACULAR THAT ISN'T IT 
AND SHE DIED SEVEN MONTHS AFTER THAT 
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES SHEFFIELD'S STEEL INDUSTRY WENT BUST 
THE LOCAL STEELWORKS CLOSED DOWN WITH HUGE JOB LOSSES 
A DECADE LATER THE COMEDY THE FULL MONTY REMINDED US HOW STEEL WORKERS COULD PUT THEIR TOOLS TO BETTER USE 
THE FILM USED AUTHENTIC LOCAL SETTINGS AND AT SHIREGREEN WORKING MEN'S CLUB 
ACTORS GOT A LITTLE MORE THAN THEY BARGAINED FOR WHEN A LOCAL AUDIENCE WANTED TO CHECK THEIR CREDENTIALS 
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO THEN SHIFTY 
JUST A BIT OF ADVERTISING FOR SOME MATES OH AYE 
AND WHO IS GOING TO COME AND SEE YOUR MATES 
WELL THIS LOT GO ALL THE WAY 
DON'T THEY LADS THE FULL MONTY 
YOU LOT 
WOW THAT GIVES IT AWAY THE OLD GOLD CURTAIN 
IT BRINGS BACK A FEW MEMORIES IT'S VERY DIFFERENT WITH NOBODY IN 
BLOKES FROM T'PUB ARE IN THERE 
BASTARDS YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT ONCE YOU'RE ON STAGE 
ONCE I'M ON STAGE WHAT DO YOU MEAN ONCE I'M ON STAGE I'M GOING NOWHERE NEAR THE FUCKIN' STAGE 
IT'S SUICIDE THAT'S WHAT IT IS SUICIDE 
QUITE A FEW OF OUR FAMILY GOT PARTS AS EXTRAS 
MY HUSBAND CAME HOME FROM WORK AND I SAID THIS IS WHAT WE WERE GONNA DO 
AND HE SAID IT'LL BE A PORNO FILM 
IF IT'S AT SHIREGREEN CLUB YOU KNOW IT'LL BE A PORNO FILM 
HE DIDN'T ASK ME MUCH ABOUT IT 
I WENT HOME THIS PARTICULAR DAY 
I WENT HOME YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE IT I SAID THEY STRIPPED OFF TOTALLY NAKED 
HE SAID I TOLD YOU IT WERE GOING BE A PORNO FILM 
IT DID SEEM DODGY AT THE TIME 
DIDN'T IT 
IT'S STILL OPEN WOW 
IT LOOKS DIFFERENT STILL GOT THE OLD RED WALLS THERE 
SHIT I'LL GIVE THE MONEY BACK 
ALAN ANNOUNCE IT PLEASE 
WITH FOUR HUNDRED HORNY PUNTERS ASK ME ANOTHER ONE KID 
ALL ROUND HERE WE HAD ALL THE MIRRORS 
AND THE TABLES AND ALL THE GUYS WERE SAT THERE GETTING READY 
AND PUTTING ALL THE MAKE UP ON AND GETTING REALLY REALLY NERVOUS 
OUR OLD DINNER LADY'S ON THE FRONT ROW 
WE'RE GOING TO GET TORN TO PIECES THEY WEREN'T DANCERS 
THEY WEREN'T STRIPPERS 
AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE BODIES OF DANCERS OR STRIPPERS MOST OF THEM 
THERE'S A BIT OF A REVOLT GOING ON NO WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT 
SO THE MAKE UP GIRLS WENT OUT AND GOT QUITE A BIT OF WINE AND WHISKY LISTEN 
IF WE'RE DOING THIS THEN JUST THIS ONCE WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT 
NOW COME ON I DON'T THINK THEY WERE COMPLETELY SOBER 
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THIS IS WHERE THEY FILMED THEM GOING ON 
AND THAT'S THE ACTUAL ENTRANCE TO THE STAGE 
OH LOOK AT THE CURTAIN WOW 
IT'S SEEN BETTER DAYS NOW BY THE LOOK OF IT 
WE MAY NOT BE YOUNG WE MAY NOT BE PRETTY 
WE MAY NOT BE RIGHT GOOD BUT WE'RE HERE 
WE'RE LIVE AND FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY WE'RE GOING FOR THE FULL MONTY 
JUST THE TENSION FROM EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM AND ONE LADY DID RUN 
TO THE FRONT AND GO I'M GOING TO BITE YOUR ARSE AT ONE POINT 
I WAS REALLY FRIGHTENED HUGO SPEER WAS LIKE 
OBVIOUSLY WITH ALL THE CROWD THERE THEY WERE GETTING REALLY REALLY NERVOUS AND ALL THEY WERE DOING 
BASICALLY WAS FORGETTING IT OR HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE MUSIC AND EVERYTHING 
YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR HAT ON 
THERE WAS I ON THE FLOOR GOING ONE TWO THREE KNICKERS OFF NOW 
YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR HAT ON 
WHAT I REMEMBER IS EVERYBODY SITTING HERE GOING OFF OFF OFF 
TURN ON THE LIGHT 
NO ALL THE LIGHTS 
ONE OF THE REAL HASSLES WAS THE FACT THAT THEY HAD THESE LEATHER THONGS 
I HAD SUGGESTED THAT SOMETHING IN LYCRA OR SPANDEX WOULD BE IDEAL 
BUT THE GUYS WERE GOING TO HAVE LEATHER OR DIE 
SO I SAID YOU WILL PAY THE PRICE AND ON THE DAY THEY PAID THE PRICE 
PULLING LEATHER FROM THAT SORT OF A REGION AND GETTING IT TO THIS AREA 
ALL IN ONE MOVEMENT AND YOU HAVE GOT ONE COUNT WITHIN WHICH TO DO IT IT REALLY HAD TO COME OUT QUITE QUICKLY 
HAVING PULLED IT OUT TEN OR TWELVE TIMES AND WE HADN'T GOT THE TAKE THE WHOLE THING GOT A LITTLE BIT FRAUGHT 
IT WAS SORT OF LIKE YOU GOT THAT WRONG YOU GOT THAT WRONG WE HAVE TO DO ANOTHER TAKE 
AND OH WHY DIDN'T YOU PULL IT OUT QUICKER 
OR YOU'RE GOING TOO FAST WHY ARE YOU BENDING YOUR KNEES YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IT LIKE THAT 
IT WAS A TERRIFYING THING TO DO IN FRONT OF ALL OF THOSE WOMEN WHO BY THAT TIME WERE BAYING FOR BLOOD 
ANYBODY THAT FELT INTIMIDATED WITH HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE ACTUALLY HERE AND SCREAMING 
WE JUST WANTED THEM TO DO IT THAT'S RIGHT 
YOU MANAGED TO SEE WHAT YOU NEEDED TO SEE PUT IT THAT WAY 
TONIGHT'S YORKSHIRE LEG OF THE COMEDY MAP IS ALMOST OVER 
WE'VE SEEN HUMOUR INSPIRED BY FERRETS AIRPORTS CHIPPIES AND STRIPPERS 
SO PERHAPS IT'S FITTING THAT WE END OUR TOUR AT THIS LOCAL RADIO STATION 
TO MEET A MAN OF MANY VOICES WHO RECALLS A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH A SECURITY GUARD 
HALLAM F. M. THE SOUND OF LEVEL FORTY TWO THERE 
AND LEAVING ME NOW 
THEY GET THEIR NAME FROM THE HIGHEST MULTI STOREY CAR PARK IN THE WORLD WHERE THE TOP LEVEL IS LEVEL FORTY TWO 
THE TIME IS COMING UP TO FOUR HUNDRED SIX RIGHT HERE 
IN A MOMENT DEAD OR ALIVE YEAH 
ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS AGO I WORKED HERE IN THE HALLAM F. M. BUILDING 
IT ALL HAPPENED HERE IN THE YEAR OF NINETEEN NINETY ONE 
THIS WEEKEND THE WORLD IS A SAFER NEIGHBOURHOOD AFTER COLONIC GADDAFI 
ANNOUNCED HE WAS GIVING UP HIS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
IS THIS YOUR VAN YES 
IT'S GORGEOUS 
I JUST HAD TO COME OVER AND SAY HELLO IF I WAS TO LOOK UP SHIT 
IN THE DICTIONARY THERE WOULD BE A PICTURE OF YOU LEAVE 
THIS IS THE STUDIO WHERE I USED TO WORK 
THIS WAS MY TIME TRAVELLING DEVICE 
IN THERE 
IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE THIS DOOR WAS JUST MADE OF WOOD 
NOW IT'S TECHNOLOGICAL AND METALLIC BUT THE LITTLE WINDOW IS THE SAME 
JON CAME HERE TO D. J. AND HE USED TO COME OUT AT NIGHT TIME 
HE WOULD DO DIFFERENT VOICES LIKE BENNY HILL 
JOHN WAYNE HE WERE BRILLIANT 
A BRILLIANT BLOKE HE GOT T'VOICE FOR IT 
MAYBE IF YOU REVERSED THE POLARITY 
IT WILL FREE US FROM THE FORCE FIELD 
I WOULD ALWAYS DO VOICES AND CHARACTERS IN THE SHOW 
JUST SOMETHING TO SPRINKLE IN THIS IS GEORGE W. BUSH 
I BELIEVE THE BIG JON OF BREAKFAST SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE 
AND THE HALLAM STER SHOULD REPLACE HIS GODDAM SHOW 
LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN 
IF THERE WAS SPORTS NEWS ON YOU MIGHT BECOME 
FRANK BRUNO AND SAY WICKED GOOD LUCK NICE ONE WICKED 
IF YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT AN EXHIBITION THAT WAS ON IN TOWN 
YOU WOULD PROBABLY BECOME BRIAN SEWELL AND SAY HOW ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
I USED TO TURN MY BACK ON HIM HERE 
AND HE WOULD START AND YOU'D THINK BENNY HILL WERE IN HERE 
HI FORMER PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR HERE GIZ A JOB 
I'D OFTEN READ THE WEATHER IN FRANK BRUNO'S VOICE 
OR DO A SORT OF BOB GELDOF DOING SOME SORT OF RECIPE OR SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT I SAID JON GO BACK IN THE STUDIO 
HE USED TO TAKE OFF 
AND THEN HE WOULD COME OUT AGAIN 
EVERY TIME HE CAME JUST LIKE THAT 
CHRIS ISAAK WICKED GAME 
THAT WAS JUST NINETEEN NINETY NINETEEN NINETY IN PLASTIC 
I REMEMBER HERE JIM WAS A GREAT SOUNDING BOARD 
BECAUSE HE'D BE VERY VERY HONEST 
DIFFERENT VOICES EVERY TIME 
YOU USED TO GO HE'S AT IT AGAIN 
TERRY CHRISTIAN 
I REMEMBER DOING THAT FOR JIMMY 
HE'D SAY OH AYE HE TALKS PROPER BROAD 
I THINK YOU'VE GOT THAT LAD I THINK YOU'VE GOT THAT 
OTHER TIMES HE'D LOOK AT YOU BLANKLY AND GO WHO'S THAT SUPPOSED TO BE 
I THINK YOU NEED SOME MORE WORK ON THAT ONE SON 
ANYWAY SAFE JOURNEY 
PEOPLE OF BRITAIN THIS IS YOUR PRIME MINISTER 
HEY HELLO THERE AND WELCOME TO POINTS OF VIEW 
WHEN WE FIRST MOVED INTO THIS BUILDING THIS WAS THE OLD BALLROOM 
WE HAD A CORPORATE EVENT WHERE WE INVITED THE RADIO STATION'S 
CLIENTS DOWN FOR CHEESE ON A STICK AND THIS KIND OF STUFF 
I WAS HOSTING IT ON BEHALF OF HALLAM F. M. AND JON CULSHAW WAS HOSTING IT 
ON BEHALF OF GREAT YORKSHIRE GOLDEN 
IT WAS SORT OF KNOWN AROUND THE BUILDING HERE THAT I WAS TRYING TO GET FURTHER ON 
DOING THE VOICES AND THEY SAID IT WOULD BE A GOOD SHOWCASE FOR YOU 
WHY DON'T YOU PUT SOME VOICES TOGETHER PUT SOME GAGS WITH THEM AND SEE HOW YOU GET ON 
DOWN AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM 
WE HAD A GREAT BIG STAGE WHERE I WAS ON FIRST COMPERING IT 
AND INTRODUCED JON WHO GOT UP AND DID HIS FIVE MINUTE IMPRESSION SPOT 
I STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE STAGE GOING I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS GUY IS DOING THIS 
I REMEMBER WEARING THIS RIDICULOUS COLOURED WAISTCOAT WHICH LOOKED LIKE A FIGHT BETWEEN SEVERAL PARROTS 
THINKING IT WAS QUITE SHOWBIZ 
HE ABSOLUTELY FLOORED THE PLACE THEY ROOM LOVED HIM 
AND THIS WAS HERE PROBABLY JON CULSHAW'S FIRST EVER GIG 
I CAN LAY CLAIM TO THAT AND I INTRODUCED HIM 
O. K. HERE WE GO AND ANNOY ANNOY ANNOY IRRITATE ANNOY

JON CULSHAW AND I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR MR. MOTIVATOR HARRY CARPENTER WOLF FROM GLADIATORS 
I'D SIT HERE FOR HOURS ON END TO MAKE A NICE LITTLE DEMO TAPE 
OF IMPRESSIONS ONE AFTER THE OTHER TO SEND OFF TO SPITTING IMAGE 
YOU HAVE TO BE QUITE PERSISTENT 
BUT I THINK AFTER A COUPLE OF GOES I GOT A SHOT AT IT 
BUT ALL OF THAT STARTED OFF FROM HERE 
HANG ON YOU'RE NOT MY GRANNY NO 
I AM THE WOLF SNARL I SAID SNARL

AROUND OUR FUN FILLED COMEDY INTERACTIVE MAP
