CLAMPING DOWN ON BOSSES WHO GIVE 
JOBS TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BUT CAN 
THE GOVERNMENT MEET THE COST OF 
SENDING WORKERS HOME 
GOOD MORNING IT IS MONDAY FIFTH MAY 
ALSO AHEAD 
PRISON OFFICERS SAY DANGEROUS 
CRIMINALS ARE BEING SENT TO OPEN 
PRISONS BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH 
SPACE IN SECURE JAILS STILL 
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS SCARLETT 
KEELING'S MOTHER MOTHER RETURNS 
FROM INDIA WITH SUSPICIONS ABOUT 
HER KILLER 
THE SHRINKING BAND OF CRAFTSMEN WHO 
ARE HAVING THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF 
THEIR SAILS 
WHEN YOU SEE SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
WORKING ALL THEIR LIVES AND THEY 
ARE GOING TO DIE AND NOBODY IS 
GOING TO TAKE IT ON IT IS SADDER 
MORE THAN ANYTHING 
I'M ON A CAMP SITE IN NORTHERN 
FRANCE WITH THE BRITISH HOLIDAY 
MAKERS FINDING OUT THEIR POUND 
ISN'T GOING AS FAR AS IT USED TO 
DOESN'T THE WEATHER LOOK NICE SOME 
OF US WILL HAVE A DAY SIMILAR TO 
THAT TODAY BUT THERE IS RAIN 
AROUND CHILLY FOR SOME AND HUMID 
FOR OTHERS I WILL TELL YOU WHERE 
IN FIFTEEN MINUTES THE B. B. C. CAN 
EXCLUSIVELY REVEAL THERE HAS BEEN 
AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF 
EMPLOYERS BEING PROSECUTED FOR 
HIRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
IMMIGRANTS IN THE TWO MONTHS 
SINCE A CHANGE IN THE LAW ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN 
BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN CAUGHT 
EMPLOYING PEOPLE WITH NO RIGHT TO 
WORK THAT'S TEN TIMES AS MANY IN 
THE WHOLE OF LAST YEAR ANDREW 
BOMFORD REPORTS 
AT A A CHICKING PROCESSING PLANT 
IMMIGRATION OFFICERS AND THE POLICE 
ARE ARE LOOKING FOR ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS IMMIGRANTS SHOCKED SCARED AND CONFUSED FIFTY SIX 
WORKERS ARE LINED UP 
WE ARE HERE TO SEE IF ANYBODY IS 
HERE WORKING ILLEGALLY IT IS GOING 
TO TAKE A BIT OF TIME BUT WE ARE 
GOING TO SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU AND 
FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE 
TWENTY TWO WORKERS WORKERS TURN OUT TO BE 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BUT THEY ARE 
NOT THE MAIN FOCUS THE MAIN TARGET 
IS EMPLOYERS LARGE SCALE 
OPERATIONS LIKE THIS WILL ONLY MAKE 
THE TINIEST DIFFERENCE TO THE HUGE 
NUMBERS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN 
THIS COUNTRY THE IDEA IS TO GO 
AFTER THE EMPLOYERS IN THE HOPE 
THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE ALL 
THESE PEOPLE ARE HERE TO WORK IF 
YOU STOP THE WORK YOU REMOVE THE 
POLL FACTOR DRIVING AND ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION IMMIGRATION IN EIGHT WEEKS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FINES HAVE 
BEEN HANDED OUT TO SIXTY BUSINESSES 
HIRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
INVESTIGATIONS ARE CONTINUING INTO 
SEVENTY OTHER EMPLOYERS INCLUDING THIS 
ONE WHERE IT HAS YET TO BE DECIDED 
IF THEY HAVE DONE ANYTHING WRONG 
THERE ARE DODGY EMPLOYERS OUT THERE 
WHO ARE TRYING TO UNDERCUT 
COMPETITORS AND DRIVE DOWN WAGES BY 
EMPLOYING PEOPLE ILLEGALLY WE HAVE 
COME UP WITH A NEW WAY OF TAKING 
ACTION AGAINST THE BUSINESSES THAT 
BREAK THE RULES 
SOME EMPLOYERS BELIEVE THEY HAVE 
BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY THIS MAN WAS 
FINED SIX THOUSAND FOR HIRING FOUR 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AT ANOTHER OF 
HIS RESTAURANTS 
IF ANYONE COMING WITH A BRITISH 
PASSPORT HOW DO I KNOW THIS IS A 
FAKE BRITISH PASSPORT I HAVEN'T 
GOT ANY MACHINE FOR ANYTHING 
DON'T YOU THINK IT IS DIFFICULT FOR 
THE EMPLOYERS 
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR 
THE EMPLOYER TO PROVE 
DEALING WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IS 
PROVING AN EXPENSIVE PROBLEM 
DEPORTING THEM COSTS ELEVEN THOUSAND PER 
PERSON WITH PERSON FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS THE DEPORTATION BILL 
COULD RUN TO AN ESTIMATED FIVE 
BILLION 
ANDREW BOMFORD IS HERE 
CLEARLY THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT ARE 
DESCRIBING THIS AS A SUCCESS BUT 
THE TORIES ARE SAYING NOT ENOUGH IS 
BEING DONE 
THE CONSERVATIVES AND 
THE OPPOSITION SAY THE GOVERNMENT 
HAD A WOEFUL RECORD IN THIS AREA IN 
THE LAST TEN YEARS IN TEN YEARS 
THEY MANAGED TO TO PROSECUTE SEVENTY ONE 
EMPLOYERS THE DIFFERENCE SINCE THE 
CHANGE IN THE LAW HAS BEEN MARKED 
AND THE GOVERNMENT IS PLEASED ABOUT 
THIS THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE 
SAYING THIS HAS GOT TO BE SUSTAINED 
THEY HAVE GOT TO KEEP ON AT THIS 
THEY HAVE GOT TO KEEP UP THE LEVEL 
OF ACTIVITY 
APART FROM PROSECUTING THOSE THAT 
EMPLOY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IS THERE 
ANY SUTIONZ TO TO SOLUTIONS TO 
THIS 
THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO MAKE THIS THIS IS A DIFFICULT PLACE FOR 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO STOP THE 
TEMPTATION TO COME HEREMENT THAT'S 
THE MAIN TACK THE OTHER PARTIES 
HAVE IDEAS THE YDZ FOR EXAMPLE 
THE IDEAS FOR EXAMPLE TALKED ABOUT 
THEY DON'T USE THE WORD AMNESTY 
BUT HAVING AN EARNED REGULARISATION 
PROGRAMME THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED BY 
OTHER POLITICIANS BUT LABOUR WANT 
TO CRACKDOWN 
YOU CAN PHONE US OR YOU CAN TEXT US 
AND YOU CAN E. MAIL US FROM OUR 
WEBSITE IF YOU HAVE GOT ANY COMMENT 
ON THE STORIES WE ARE DOING THIS 
MORNING MORNING UNSUITABLE AND DANGEROUS CONVICTS 
ARE BEING SENT TO OPEN PRISONS TO 
SOLVE THE OVERCROWDING CRISIS 
THAT'S THE CLAIM BEING MADE BY 
LEADING PRISON OFFICERSMENT IT TOLD 
THE B. B. C. ONCE IN SOME CRIMINALS ARE 
WALKING OUT AND IT IS PUTTING 
PUBLIC SAFETY AT RISK 
THIS IS RICHARD MCDONALD A MAN 
WITH A VIOLENT CRIMINAL HISTORY AND 
KNOWN TO THE POLICE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE SHOWS MCDONALD AND AN 
ACCOMPLICE ROBBING SYDENHAM 
RAILWAY STATION THEY FOLLOW STAFF 
INTO THE CASH OFFICE THEY LEAVE 
WITH EIGHT THOUSAND 
WHEN THE POLICE REVIEWED THE VIDEO 
FOOTAGE THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT 
THEY WERE SEEING 
THE C. C. T. V. WAS SHOWN TO ONE OF THE 
ROBBERY SQUAD OFFICERS THAT WAS ON 
THE SQUAD IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND HE IDENTIFIED 
THE ROBBER AS BEING MR. MCDONALD 
WHICH WAS MOST SURPRISING BECAUSE 
WE BELIEVED MR. MCDONALD WAS IN 
PRISON SERVING FOR ROBBERIES ON THE 
RAILWAY AT THAT TIME 
IN FACT MCDONALD HAD BEEN 
TRANSFERRED TO FORD OPEN PRISON IN 
WEST SUSSEX HE HAD SIMPLY WALKED 
OUT PLIZ OFFICERS SAY THE TRANSFER 
OF UNSUITABLE PRISONERS IS A TREND 
THAT'S PUTTING THE PUBLIC AT RISK 
THERE IS NO DOUBT FROM THE 
INFORMATION I'M RECEIVING FROM MY 
MEMBERS THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE 
WRONG PRISONERS THE WRONG INMATES 
THE WRONG OFFENDERS WHATEVER 
EXPRESSION YOU WANT TO USE INTO 
THE OPEN STATE THAT'S BEEN CAUSED 
BY THE OVERCROWDING SITUATION WE 
HAVE IN SCOTLAND AND IN ENGLAND AND 
WALES WALES WITH RECORD U. K. PRISON POPULATION 
OF OVER NINETY THOUSAND HARRY FLETCHER OF 
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
PROBATION OFFICERS IS CONCERNED 
I HAVE BEEN WORRIED FOR FIFTEEN AND EIGHTEEN 
MONTHS THAT INDIVIDUALS WERE BEING 
TRANSFERRED INTO OPEN JAILS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES WHO DID POSE A 
RISK TO THE PUBLIC AND THE REASON I 
BELIEVE THAT IS BECAUSE MEMBERS OF 
MY ORGANISATION WORKING IN PRISONS 
AND IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE TOLD ME 
THAT THAT'S THE CASE 
IN STATEMENT JACK STRAW INSISTED 
THAT PUBLIC SAFETY WAS PARAMOUNT 
BUT THOSE AT THE COAL FACE REMAIN 
WORRIED THAT CASES LIKE THAT OF 
RICHARD MCDONALD WILL OCCUR AGAIN 
YOU CAN SEE MORE ON THAT 
INVESTIGATION IN PANORAMA PRISONS 
UNLOCKED TONIGHT AT EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY ON B. B. C. ONE 
NOW UNITED NATIONS AID WORKERS IN 
BURMA SAY THEY ARE READY TO SEND 
HELP TO THOSE WORST AFFECTED BY A 
CYCLONE THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES 
HAVE YET TO GIVE PERMISSION 
OFFICIALS SAY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED IN THE STORM WHICH STRUCK ON 
SATURDAY THE WORST HIT REGION HAS 
BEEN DECLARED A DISASTER ZONE ALONG 
WITH FOUR OTHER AREAS INCLUDING 
RANGOON RANGOON THREE DAYS AFTER THE CYCLONE STRUCK 
THE TRUE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE 
REMAINS UNKNOWN FROM WHAT HAS BEEN 
SEEN SO FAR IT IS CLEAR THE PEOPLE 
CAUGHT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE 
STORM NEED HELP AND THEY NEED IT 
FAST UNITED NATIONS RELIEF TEAMS 
SAY THEY ARE READY TO GO INTO THE 
WORST AFFECTED AREAS THE BURMESE 
MILITARY GOVERNMENT WHICH KEEPS 
CONTROL OVER THE COUNTRY HAS NOT 
GIVEN CLEARANCE TO AID WORKERS 
IT IS PROBLEMATIC WITH BLOCKED 
ROADS SO IT IS HARD TO GET ACCESS 
TO THE AFFECTED POPULATION WE ARE 
BASICALLY NOW TRYING TO SEND OUT 
ASSESSMENT TEAMS BUT WE ARE USE 
AGO NATIONAL STAFF WHO HAVE A MORE 
EASY ACCESS TO THE AFFECTED AREAS 
THE CYCLONE HIT THE BURMESE COAST 
ON FRIDAY BATTERING IT WITH WINDS 
UP TO ONE HUNDRED NINETY KILOMETRES AN HOURMENT IT 
DEVASTATED COASTAL VILLAGES AND 
RIPPED THROUGH CITIES PEOPLE 
RESCUED WHATEVER THEY COULD 
POSSESSIONS AND IN THE CASE OF THIS 
WOMAN BABY 
BURMA FACES SANCTIONS AND ITS 
STATUS AS AN INTERNATIONAL PYRAAH 
WON'T MAKE THE EFFORTS ANY EASIER 
THE GOVERNMENT SAID A CONTROVERSIAL 
REFERENDUM ON NEW CONSTITUTION WHICH WAS PLANNED FOR THE TENTH 
WILL GO AHEADMENT FOR THOSE WAITING 
HELP FOOD CLOTHING SHELTER WILL 
BE FOREMOST IN THEIR MINDS 
THE LAWYER REPRESENTING THE SEVENTY THREE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PASS AND FAIL 
AT ZBST ACCORDING TO A AT GCSE 
ACCORDING TO A REPORT RESEARCHERS 
FOUND FOUND THAT PUPILS WHO GET 
GRADE C. WITH A GOOD TEACHER ARE 
ONLY LIKELY TO GET D. WITH BAD ONE ONE IT IS ESTIMATED THERE COULD BE AS 
MANY AS TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND INCOMPETENT TEACHERS 
WORKING IN CLASSROOMS IN ENGLAND 
AND WALES BUT NOW RESEARCHERS 
BELIEVE THEY HAVE QUANTIFIED THE 
DAMAGE THOSE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
ARE DOING TO THEIR PUPILS PROSPECTS 
CLASSES TAUGHT BY UNDERPERFORMING 
TEACHERS SCORED LOWER ON THEIR 
GCSES AND YOU CAN QUANTIFY THAT IF 
YOU HAVE TWO PUPILS THE SAME ONE 
WITH AN UNDERPERFORMING TEACHER AND 
THE ONE WITH AN EXCELLENT THE 
DIFFERENCE IS ONE GCSE GRADE 
REPORT ARGUES THAT TEACHING IS 
FAILING TO ATTRACT THE BEST 
GRADUATES GRADUATES IT SUGGESTS MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE 
PEOPLE FROM OTHER PROFESSIONS TO 
RETRAIN AS TEACHERS IT ALSO SAYS 
THE AMOUNT OF DAYS FOR ON THE JOB 
TRAINING FOR EXISTING TEACHERS 
SHOULD BE INCREASED FROM FIVE TO TWENTY 
DAY AS YEAR 
TEAPERS LEAD TEACHERS LEADERS

ACHIEVEMENT THEY WEREN'T FANCIED 
TO GO UP AT THE START OF THE SEASON 
BUT THEY PROVED CRITICS WRONG AND 
THEY ARE THERE SIXTY MILLION FOR 
GETTING INTO THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
THEY RECKON 
IMAGINE WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THAT 
STOKE CITY ARE BACK IN THE BIG TIME 
THEIR GOALLESS DRAW WAS ENOUGH TO 
CLAIM THE SECOND AUTOMATIC 
PROMOTION PLACE BEHIND WEST BROM 
THE RESULT ALSO CONDEMNED LEICESTER 
TO THE THIRD TIER OF ENGLISH 
FOOTBALL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
THEIR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR YEAR HISTORY 
WE WILL HAVE MORE SHORTLYMENT 
LET'S GO BACK TO THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
WITH STOKE AND WEST BROM ARE 
HEADING ARSENAL WILL BE WITHOUT A 
MID FIELDER AFTER A. C. MILAN THEY ARE 
ABOUT TO SIGN THE LAYER THE 
PLAYER PLAYER THE DEFEAT MEANS EVERTON WILL FACE 
AN ANXIOUS LAST DAY OF THE SEASON 
WHEN THEY HOST NEWCASTLE 
ONE ONE PLAYER WON'T BE THERE IS IS 
YENS LEHMANN 
SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON SAW HIS 
MANCHESTER CITY TEAM LOSE ONE TO ZERO AWAY 
TO LIVERPOOL AS TOR RES TORFAEN REZ 
SCORED HIS TORRES SCORED HIS THIRTY TWO 
GOAL OF THE SEASON 
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT IS 
GOING ON THERE SEEMS TO BE 
CONFUSION 
NO I CANNOT AND EVEN CONFUSION IF I COULD I SHOULDN'T DO IT L. 
DON'T THINK IT IS FAIR AGAINST 
ANYONE TO SPEAK OUT BEFORE THE 
SEASON IS BIN FISHED ANDS 
FINISHED AND IT IS ONE WEEK SO WE 
HAVE TO BE PATIENT AND WE HAVE TO 
TRY TO MAKE A VERY GOOD MATCH AT AT 
MIDDLESBROUGH MIDDLESBROUGH THE FANS WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEIR 
FUTURE IS GOING TO BE THAT'S THE 
FRUSTRATING PART OF IT FOR THEM 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT OF COURSE 
I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IT IS ONE 
GAME TO GO LET'S PLAY THAT GAME 
AND THEN AS I SAID I THINK IT IS 
TIME TO TALK AFTER THAT 
THEY HAVE BEEN AWAY FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS 
BUT STOKE CITY ARE BACK IN THE BIG 
TIME THEIR GOALLESS DRAW AGAINST 
LEICESTER WAS ENOUGH TO CLINCH THE 
SECOND AUTOMATIC PROMOTION PLACE 
AND THE RESULT CONDEMN LEICESTER TO 
THE THIRD TIER OF ENGLISH FOOTBALL 
HERE IS JOE WILSON 
WHEN THE FANS CELEBRATE NIL NIL 
DRAW LIKE THIS YOU KNOW IT IS A 
MATCH THAT REALLY MATTERS 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE OPPOSING FANS 
REACT TO THE SAME RESULT LIKE THIS 
THE CLIMAX TO A SEASON IN ITS MOST 
VIVID CONTRAST STOKE IN THE 
STRIPES WERE TRYING TO WIN TO MAKE 
SURE THEY WERE PROMOTEDMENT LEST 
LEST WERE TRYING TO MAKE MAKE SURE 
THEY WEREN'T RELEGATED AND FOR THEM 
IT BECAME DESPERATE 
THEY CAN'T FIND A WAY THROUGH LEICESTER 
THE RADIOS RELAYED INFORMATION FROM 
OTHER GAMES LEICESTER HEARD THAT 
SOUTHAMPTON WERE WINNING STOKE 
KNEW THEIR RIVALS FOR PROMOTION 
WERE STRUGGLING HULL IN THE GOLD 
SHIRTS LOST TO IPSWICH IT MEANT 
THAT SECOND PLACE IN THE LEAGUE WAS 
STOKE'S AND PROMOTION WITH IT 
PREMIER LEAGUE FOR THE CLUB FOR THE 
FIRST TIME SIXTY MILLION HEADING 
THEIR WAY 
IT IS AMAZING NIL NIL BUT IT 
DOESN'T MATTER WE ARE UP 
WE AT LAST STARTED TO PUNCH OUR 
WEIGHT WEIGHT THERE HAS BEEN LOFT CHANGE THE 
FOOTBALL CLUB IT PUSHED ON AND

WORK AND EFFORT BEHIND THE SCENES

EMMA JONES IS CONTEMPLATING HER 
DREAM HOME IN LONDON DOCKLANDS 
YOU KNOW I MIGHT OF FOUND A 
PROPERTY WHICH IS SMALLER THAN MY 
OWN FLAT EYE AT THE GRAND I'M 
AT THE GRAND DESIGNS EXHIBITION AND 
I WILL BE LOOKING AT THE EFFECTS OF 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH ON PROPERTY 
S. A BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY AND OF 
COURSE THE WEATHER IS VERY 
IMPORTANT HERE'S CAROL 
GOOD MORNING THERE IS SUNSHINE 
AROUND BUT FOR SOME THERE IS RAIN 
THIS WEEKEND WE COULD BE LOOKING 
AT TEMPERATURES AS HIGH AS TWENTY FOUR 
CELSIUS BUT TO START WITH PARTS 
OF SCOTLAND THE NORTH WEST AND 
WALES IT IS A CHILLY START YOU CAN 
SEE THIS LINE OF CLOUD ACROSS 
ENGLAND AND WALES WHICH IS 
CURRENTLY PRODUCING RAIN AND SOME 
OF IT IS HEAVY BUT NINE A M. THE SOUTH 
EASTERN CORNER WILL BE ENJOYING 
BLUE SKIES AND SOME SUNSHINE BUT 
HEAD FURTHER NORTH AND WE'RE INTO 
THE RAIN BAND THERE ARE BREAKS AS 
WE MOVE OVER TO CUMBRIA SCOTLAND 
IS SEEING SUNNY SKIES THIS MORNING 
BUT NEAR TO THE COASTS THERE IS 
MIST AND FOG LAPPING IN AND OUT IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND GENERALLY THE 
COASTS WILL HAVE FOG BUT INLAND 
IT IS A LOVELY START TO THE DAY 
AND EVENTUALLY IN WALES IT WILL BE 
LOVELY AWAY FROM THE COASTS WHERE 
THE FOG WILL LAP UP ON TO THE 
SHORES SHORES THAT BAND OF RAIN WILL MOVE UP TO 
THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND WEECH 
THE EAST OF WALES AND THE SOUTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND REACH THIS 
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT THAT BAND OF 
CLOUD AND RAIN PETERS OUT AS IT 
MOVES ACROSS SCOTLAND AND THERE 
WILL BE FIVE LOT OF CLEAR SKIES SO 
TOMORROW MORNING THERE WILL BE A 
LOT OF SUNSHINE FIRST THING BUT 
THE ORKNEY AND SHETLAND ISLES WILL 
HAVE LITTLE MORE CLOUD TOMORROW 
FOR WEDNESDAY IT IS ALMOST A 
REPEAT PERFORMANCE IN THAT THERE 
WILL BE A LOT OF SUNSHINE AND A LOT 
OF BLUE SKY AROUND WITH VARIABLE 
AMOUNTS OF CLOUD POSSIBLY 
PRODUCING THE ODD SHOWER HERE AND 
THERE BUT TEMPERATURES STILL GOOD 
FOR THE TIME OF YEAR TWENTY TWO CELSIUS IS 
SEVENTY TWO FAHRENHEIT 
THAT IS LOOKING FANTASTIC THE 
BUSINESS NEWS WITH DECLAN IS 
LOOKING AT THE RISING COASTS OF 
HOLIDAYS IN THE CONTINENT DECLAN 
IT IS LOOKING LOVELY THERE WHERE 
ARE YOU 
IT IS GORGEOUS HERE WE'RE 
ABOUT FIFTY MILES NORTH EAST OF PARIS 
AND ON ONE OF THE MANY CAMP SITES 
YOU'LL FIND HERE BUT FAMILIES ARE 
FINDING THAT HOLIDAYS ON THE 
CONTINENT THIS YEAR WILL BE THAT 
BIT MORE EXPENSIVE NO MATTER WHERE 
YOU GO BECAUSE THE VALUE OF THE 
POUND HAS FALLEN AGAINST THE SINGLE 
EUROPEAN CURRENCY THE POUND IS 
DOWN BY AROUND SEVENTEEN PER CENT ON THE MARKETS 
THIS MORNING SO THE PURCHASING 
POWER OF HER POUND AT THE BUREAU DE 
CHANGE HAS FALLEN BY AN EQUIVALENT 
AMOUNT ADD IN RISING FUEL COSTS 
AND RISING INFLATION AND RISING 
FOOD COSTS AND HOLIDAYS ON THE 
CONTINENT ARE NOT AS CHEAP AS THEY 
ONCE WERE WITH A TOUR AROUND 
EUROPE HERE IS BRIAN MILLIGAN 
IT IS THE MOST FAMOUS ANTIQUITY IN 
THE WORLD THE ACROPOLIS IN ATHENS 
BUT ARE THE PRICES MONUMENTAL 
LAST YEAR IT WOULD HAVE COST SEVEN POINT NINE 
TO GO UP THERE THIS YEAR IT IS 
NINE POINT THREE SIX AND ALL BECAUSE OF THE 
STRONGER EURO 
OR HOW ABOUT THE TOWER OF PISA 
LAST YEAR IT INCLINED TOWARDS THE 
AFFORDABLE AT NINE POINT NINE OH PERSON THIS 
YEAR THE TILT IS RATHER MORE 
EXTREME AT ELEVEN POINT SEVEN OH BUT IF THAT IS 
THE COST OF EXPERIENCING AN 
OVERHANG HOW ABOUT A HANGOVER 
LUCKILY THE PRICE OF BEER IN 
SPAIN IS STILL PRETTY LOW LAST 
YEAR AROUND SIXTY SIX P. THIS YEAR SEVENTY EIGHT P. 
AND AFTER A FEW OF THEM YOU 
PROBABLY WON'T NOTICE THE 
DIFFERENCE ANY WAY BUT WHERE CAN 
YOU GO WHERE YOUR POUND IS STILL 
SOUND 
YOU ONE TO LEAVE THE EUROZONE SOUND AND TURKEY HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN 
GOOD VALUE BUT THE HIGH PRICE OF 
OIL MEANS IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE TO 
GET THERE BULGARIA IS LOOKING 
CHEAP AS IS CROATIA BUT FOR THE 
LOWEST PRICES IN EUROPE YOU HAVE 
TO CROSS THE BORDER INTO SERBIA 
TREMENDOUS VALUE AND THEY WON'T 
LAUGH AT YOUR POUND 
FOR EXAMPLE THE PRICE OF A COFFEE 
IN SERBIA CAN BE AS LOW AS FIFTY P. OR 
STAYING OVERNIGHT IN A HOSTEL IN 
BELGRADE CAN COST YOU SEVEN INCLUDING 
BREAKFAST BREAKFAST BUT BACK IN THE EUROZONE REMEMBER 
THERE HAS BEEN INFLATION TOO SO 
LAST YEAR A RIDE IN THE LIFT UP 
THE EIFFEL TOWER WOULD HAVE COST 
YOU SEVEN POINT FIVE NINE THIS YEAR IT HAS GONE 
SKY HIGH AT NINE POINT THREE SO THIS SUMMER 
YOU CAN SPOT THE BRITISH THEY ARE 
THE ONES TAKING THE STAIRS 
THAT'S CALLED USING PUBLIC MONEY 
WISELY I SUPPOSE THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH WE HAVE A COUPLE OF EARLY 
MORNING CAMPERS WITH US AND 
STEPHEN LANE IS FROM ONE OF THE 
HOLIDAY COMPANIES YOU TWO ARE 
ITCHING TO GET ON THE GOLF COURSE 
WE ARE 
YOU'RE ON A GOLFING HOLIDAY 
AND THIS IS YOUR BASE FOR THAT IT IT IS DECLAN WE LOVE COMING TO 
FRANCE FRANCE HAS MORE GOLF 
COURSES THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN 
EUROPE WE'RE FROM SCOTLAND 
YOU'RE NOT SHORT OF GOLF COURSE 
OR TWO BACK HOME 
NO WE'RE NOT R. 
FROM GLENEAGLES OR SAINT ANDREWS BUT 
RELATIVELY THE GOLF IN FRANCE IS 
SO MUCH CHEAPER COMPARED TO WHERE 
WE LIVE AND THROUGHOUT BRITAIN SO SO EVEN WITH THE STRONG EURO IT IS 
STILL CHEAPER FOR YOU TO COME HERE 
MARGARET 
DEFINITELY WE'VE BEEN MARGARET COMING TO FRANCE FOR THREE OR FOUR 
YEARS WITH CANVAS TO PLAY GOLF 
AND ALTHOUGH THIS YEAR WE'VE 
NOTICED THAT MONEY IS NOT GOING AS 
FAR I'D STILL RATHER COME HERE AND 
PLAY MAYBE ONLY EIGHT ROUNDS OF 
GOLF BUT GET THE BENEFITS OF THE 
COUNTRY 
I KNOW YOU'RETYING OFF COUNTRY SOON BUT STEPHEN YOU RELY ON A 
LOT OF BRITS COMING OVER HERE AND 
THEY'RE FINDING THINGS ARE MORE 
EXPENSIVE THIS YEAR 
THAT'S RIGHT 
WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO CUSTOMERS 
AND THEY'RE FINDING THAT THE MONEY 
IS NOT GOING QUITE AS FAR HOWEVER 
WE WERE TALKING TO THEM LAST NIGHT 
AS THEY WERE STOKING UP THEIR 
BARBECUES AND NONE WERE PREPARED 
TO GIVE UP THE LIFESTYLE THEY'RE 
BUYING INTO THE GREAT OUTDOORS 
THEY DO NOT WANT TO SACRIFICE THAT 
AND THE OVERALL COST OF LIVING HERE 
AS WE'VE SEEN IS MUCH LOWER IN 
TERMS OF PROVISIONS AND ACTIVITIES 
AND CERTAINLY FOR THE KIDS THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MORE FROM YOU DURING 
THE MORNING L. FORGOT TO ASK WHICH 
OF THE TWO OF YOU ARE THE BETTER 
GOLFER ME 
MY WIFE 
AND ARE YOU GOLFER ME GOING TO BEAT HIM AGAIN TODAY NO NO HE BEAT ME YESTERDAY ACTUALLY SO 
HE IS GETTING BETTER BUT IT IS A 
RAREITY 
NOW A LOOK AT THE FRONT PAGES THE 
PICTURE IS OF THE QUEEN BUT THIS 
IS AN INCOGNITO TRIP ON A MINIATURE 
TRAIN IN THE NEW FOREST NOBODY 
REALISED SHE WAS THERE AND THERE 
WERE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 
THERE AND MINISTERS TELL GORDON 
BROWN YOU HAVE ONE YEAR 
AND THIS PAPER HAS THE STORY OF 
GORDON BROWN TRYING TO GET POPULAR 
WITH VOTERS AGAIN BY DUMPING A BIN 
TAX WHICH INITIALLY WAS PROPOSED 
BORIS JOHNSON PICTURED ON THE 
FRONT PAGE OF THE INDEPENDENT 
DOFFING POLICE HELMET THERE AND 
THE NEW MAYOR OF LONDON IT IS 
OFFICIALLY HIS FIRST DAY IN THE JOB 
TODAY AND ANOTHER GORDON BROWN 
LINE THERE WHY I SHOULD STAY IN MY 
JOB JOB PAUL GASCOIGNE HAS BEEN IN HOSPITAL 
SINCE LAST NIGHT ACCORDING TO THE 
SUN HE TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF IN 
HOTEL ROOM NOW FOR YEARS 
INVESTMENT IN PROPERTY HAS BEEN 
SEEN AS BEING AS SAFE AS HOUSES 
BUT WITH THE CREDIT CRUNCH STARTING 
TO BITE DEVELOPERS AS WELL AS 
HOMEOWNERS IS BRACING ITSELF FOR 
HARD TIMES THE FEDERATION OF 
BUILDERS IS REPORTING A DROP 
ALREADY COMPARED TO LAST YEAR 
EMMA JONES IS AT THE GRAND DESIGNS 
SHOW IN LONDON'S DOCKLANDS HELLO HELLO PLENTY OF INTERESTING VISIONS FOR 
THE FUTURE OF HOUSING HERE AT THE 
EXHIBITION WHICH IS BASED ON THE 
CHANNEL FOUR SHOW AND IS MADE TO 
HELP INSPIRE THE PUBLIC TO BUILD 
THEIR OWN HOUSES BUT BUILDERS ARE 
LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS TO GET US TO 
INVEST IN PROPERTY 
THIS BUILDER GARY WEBB HAS YET TO 
FEEL THE BITE FROM HOMEOWNERS THE 
OWNERS OF THIS HOUSE HAVE BEEN 
WAITING EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR HIM TO COME 
TO DO THE WORK THIS IS THE 
SMALLEST KIND OF JOB HE UNDERTAKES 
BUT IN A COLD CLIMATE HE PREDICTS 
IT COULD BECOME A STAPLE WE'VE WE'VE NOTICED A SLOWDOWN IN INQUIRIES 
BUT WE HAVE WORK AHEAD OF US THIS 
YEAR PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE AN 
EXTENSION RATHER THAN MOVE ON FOR FOR OTHERS THEY BELIEVE THAT PLAYING 
WITH PROPERTY WILL STILL REMAIN A 
NATIONAL PAST TEEM THIS ARCHITECT 
IS UP FOR WINNING A DESIGN AWARD 
BUT HE UNDERSTAND HOW CLIENTS WOULD 
WANT TO UPGRADE THEIR EXISTING 
HOMES 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMES STRETCHED ON MORTGAGES AND DON'T 
HAVE A LOT OF MONEY THERE ARE A 
LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE GAINED IN 
EQUITY AND DO HAVE MONEY TO SPEND 
SO WHILE SOME ARE BATONING DOWN 
THE HATCHES IT IS KITCHENS AND 
BATH ROOMS WHICH BECOME THE FOCUS 
DURING CREDIT CRUNCH 
I'M JOINED NOW BY AIDEN QUINN QIB 
WHO IS THE DESIGNER OF QUINN WHO 
IS THE DESIGNER OF THIS ECO POD 
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO 
BECOME ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND 
INVEST IN THEIR PROPERTIES DO 
PEOPLE HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND AT 
THE MOMENT 
PROBABLY NOT THE IDEA 
HERE IS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF 
ENERGY CONSUMED DURING THE LIFE OF 
THE HOUSE WE HAVE COMPLETELY 
INSULATED THE HOUSE TO A VERY HIGH 
LEVEL AND IT HAS A VERY HIGH LEVEL 
OF PERFORMANCE OVERALL 
SO YOU'RE 
SAYING THAT INNS LAGS INSULATION 
IS THE KEY WILL THAT SAVE MONEY 
INSULATION IS THE BEST IN VESTMENT 
THEY CAN MAKE AND DOUBLE GLAZING 
AND SEALING THE PROPERTY SO THERE 
IS NO AIR LEAKAGE THAT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT 
CAN YOU SEE PEOPLE IMPORTANT REALLY LISTENING IN HOUSES THIS 
SHAPE IN THE FUTURE 
IT IS JUST A 
CONCEPT IT WAS EXPERIMENTAL TO A 
DEGREE AND WE WANTED TO PROMOTE 
THE IDEA OF THE ULTIMATE IN CON 
SERVING ENERGY AND USING AS LITTLE 
ENERGY AS POSSIBLE 
AND UNDERFLOOR 
HEATING IS THAT EXPENSIVE TO 
INSTALL 
IT IS BUILT INTO THE INSTALL CONCRETE STRUCTURE SO IT DOESN'T 
ADD MUCH TO THE COST 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH THERE IS PLENTY MORE 
FROM THE EXHIBITION AT LONDON'S 
DOCK LPBLDZ WE'LL BE TALKING TO 
PEOPLE ALL DOCKLANDS WE'LL BE 
TUCKING TO PEOPLE ALL MORNING OVER

TALE OF THE KING THE COOK HIS 
KITCHEN AND HIS COOKBOOK 
STANDING THE TASTE OF TIME CHEF 
CLARISSA DICKSON WRIGHT WILL BE 
HERE TO TELL US HOW SHE HAS BEEN 
GETTING ON WITH RECIPIES CREATED 
SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO TIME NOW FOR THE 
LOCAL NEWS WHERE YOU ARE 
GOOD MORNING FROM B. B. C. LONDON NEWS 
IT IS BORIS JOHNSON'S FIRST DAY AS 
MAYOR HE OFFICIALLY TOOK OVER FROM 
KEN LIVINGSTONE AT MIDNIGHT HE'S 
EXPECTED TO USE HIS FIRST DAYS IN 
OFFICE TO PRESS AHEAD WITH THE MOST 
CONTROVERSIAL ELEMENTS OF HIS 
ELECTION MANIFESTO THEY INCLUDE 
AIRPORT STYLE SCANNERS AND KNIFE 
ARCHES ON THE TUBE NOW THE TRAVEL 
NEWS IT IS A BUSY DAY FOR PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT BECAUSE BANK HOLIDAYS 
USUALLY MEAN ENGINEERING WORK MAIN LINE TRAINS THE BIG STORY IS 
LIVERPOOL STREET STATION CLOSED AS 
A RESULT OF THIS THERE IS NO 
NATIONAL EX PRESS TRAINS AND 
OTHERS ARE STARTING AND TERMINATING 
AT TOTTENHAM HAIL BUT THE ADVICE 
IS TO CHECK YOUR PLANS THIS MORNING 
AND LONDON MIDLAND SOUTHERN AND 
VIRGIN TRAINS HAVE NO SERVICES 
SOUTH OF LIVERPOOL STREET SO CHECK 
BEFORE YOU TRAVEL 
THE COMPANY INSTALLING A NEW BRIDGE 
NEAR LIVERPOOL STREET STATION SAYS 
ANY DELAYS TOMORROW MORNING WON'T 
BE CAUSED BY THEM THE BRIDGE IS TO 
CARRY AN EXTENSION INTO THE 
SHOREDITCH AREA 
THIS BRIDGE WILL 
BE ACROSS BY TEA TIME ON BANK 
HOLIDAY MONDAY AFTERNOON WERE THAT 
NOT TO BE THE CASE WE HAVE THE 
ABILITY TO STOP THE LAUNCH AT ANY 
GIVEN TIME SO I CAN CATEGORICALLY 
STATE THIS WILL NOT ADVERSELY 
AFFECT COMMUTERS ON TUESDAY MORNING 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HELPED TO TACKLE 
THE CAUSES OF ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR 
IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE 
BEING REWARDED BY SOUTHWARK COUNCIL 
WINNERS INCLUDE THE HAY GATE ESTATE 
RESIDENTS' ASSOCIATION AND PUPILS 
WHO HAVE HELPED TO RULE OUT 
BULLYING IN CLASSROOMS 
THEY ARE 
EXCELLENT ROLES THAT WARDENS PLAY 
AND THE ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR TEAM 
PLAY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT IS 
BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITIES TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR AREA AND 
ARE REALLY MAKING CHANGES 
MEDICAL RESEARCHERS IN THE CAPITAL 
ARE TRYING TO RECRUIT PEOPLE WHO 
WERE BORN PREMATURELY TO GAUGE THE 
EFFECTS IN LATER LIFE ON THE WHOLE 
BABIES BORN EARLY REMAIN LIGHTER 
ALL THEIR LIFE COMPARED TO BABIES 
BORN FULL TERM THE WEATHER CLOUDY 
TO START WITH A LITTLE RAIN IN THE 
WEST BUT IT SHOULD CLEAR AWAY TO 
LEAVE SPELLS OF VERY WARM SUNSHINE 
AND TOP TEMPERATURES OF TWENTY THREE CELSIUS 
THAT'S IT FOR NOW WE'RE BACK IN 
HALF AN HOUR 
HELLO THIS IS BREAKFAST WITH 
SONIA DEOL AND CHARLIE STAYT 
CAN YOU ALL STAND STILL AND PUT 
YOUR KNIVES DOWN 
CLAMPING DOWN ON 
BOSSES WHO GIVE JOBS TO ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS BUT CAN THE GOVERNMENT 
MEET THE COST OF SENDING WORKERS 
HOME 
GOOD MORNING IT IS MONDAY FIFTH MAY 
ALSO AHEAD THIS MORNING PRISON 
OFFICERS SAY DANGEROUS CRIMINALS 
ARE BEING SENT TO OPEN PRISONS 
BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SPACE 
IN SECURE JAILS 
SCARLETT KEELING'S MOTHER RETURNING 
FROM INDIA STILL LOOKING FOR 
ANSWERS ABOUT HER DAUGHTER'S KILLER 
SHE WILL TELL US WHY SHE BELIEVES 
THERE HAS BEEN A COVER UP 
IS YOUR PROPERTY AS SAFE AS HOUSES 
I AM A THE GRAND DESIGN EXHIBITION 
IN LONDON LOOKING AT THE EFFECTS OF 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH ON THE MARKET 
WE'RE ON A CAMP SITE IN NORTHERN 
FRANCE WHERE THE BRITS ARE FINDING 
THAT THE POUND DOESN'T GO AS FAR AS 
IT USED TO 
AND THE SHRINKING BAND OF CRAFTSMEN 
WHO ARE HAVING THE WIND KNOCKED OUT 
OF THEIR SAILS 
PEOPLE JUST WORKING ALL THEIR LIVES 
AND THEY ARE GOING TO DIE AND 
NOBODY IS GOING TO TAKE IT ON IT 
IS SADDER MORE THAN ANYTHING 
FIRST THE B. B. C. CAN EXCLUSIVELY 
REVEAL THERE HAS BEEN A INCREASE IN 
THE NUMBERS OF EMPLOYERS BEING 
PROSECUTED FOR HIRING ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS 
SINCE THE CHANGE IN THE LAW ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN 
BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN CAUGHT 
EMPLOYING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
THAT'S TEN TIMES THE NUMBER CAUGHT 
IN THE WHOLE OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND MORE THAN 
DOUBLE THE NUMBER NUMBER PROSECUTED 
IN THE PREVIOUS TEN YEARS 
BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS FACING A 
PROBLEM IN DEALING WITH ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS ROUNDED UP IN THE 
OPERATIONS AND DEPORTING THEM IS 
COSTING BILLIONS 
AT A CHICKEN PROCESSING PLANT IN 
DERBYSHIRE IMMIGRATION OFFICERS 
AND THE POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
EVERYBODY IT IS THE UNITED KINGDOM 
BORDERS AGENCY AND POLICE CAN YOU 
STAND STILL AND PUT YOUR KNIVES 
DOWN 
SHOCKED SCARED AND CONFUSED DOWN FIFTY SIX WORKERS ARE LINED UP 
WE ARE HERE TO SEE IF ANYBODY IS 
HERE WORKING ILLEGALLY IT IS IT IS 
GOING TO TAKE A BIT OF TIME BUT WE 
WILL SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU AND FIND 
OUT WHO YOU ARE 
TWENTY TWO WORKERS TURN OUT TO BE ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS BUT THEY ARE NOT THE 
MAIN FOCUS IN OPERATIONS LIKE THIS 
THE REAL TARGET NOW IS EMPLOYERS 
EVEN LARGE SCALE OPERATIONS LIKE 
THIS WILL ONLY MAKE THE TINIEST OF 
DIFFERENCE TO THE HUGE NUMBERS OF 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY 
THE IDEA IS TO GO AFTER THE 
EMPLOYERS IN THE HOPE THAT MAKES 
THE DIFFERENCE ALL THESE PEOPLE 
ARE HERE TO WORK BUT IF THE STOP 
THE WORK YOU REMOVE THE PULL FACTOR 
DRIVING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
IN EIGHT WEEKS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WORTH OF 
FINES HAS BEEN HANDED OUT TO SIXTY 
BUSINESSES HIRING ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS INVESTIGATIONS ARE 
CONTINUING INTO OVER SEVENTY EMPLOYERS 
INCLUDING THIS ONE WHERE IT HAS YET 
TO BE DECIDED IF THEY HAVE DONE 
ANYTHING WRONG 
THERE ARE DODGY EMPLOYERS OUT THERE 
WHO ARE TRYING TO UNDERCUT THEIR 
COMPETITORS AND DRIVE DOWN BRITISH 
WAGES BY EMPLOYING PEOPLE I WILL 
LEELY AND THEY HAVE COME UP WITH 
THIS WAY OF TAKING FASTER ON THE 
SPOT ACTION AGAINST THE BUSINESSES 
THAT WILL BREAK THE RULES 
BUT SOME EMPLOYERS BELIEVE THEY 
HAVE BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY 
THIS MAN WAS FINED SIX THOUSAND FOR 
HIRING FOUR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AT 
ANOTHER OF HIS RESTAURANTS 
IF ANYONE COMING WITH BRITISH 
PASSPORT HOW DO I KNOW THIS IS A 
FAKE BRITISH PASSPORT HAVEN'T 
GOT A MACHINE OR ANYTHING 
DO YOU THINK IT IS 
DIFFICULT 
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE DIFFICULT EMPLOYER TO PROVE 
BUT DEALING WITH ILLEGAL IMGRANTSZ 
IMMIGRANTS IS PROVING AN 
EXPENSIVE PROBLEM WITH FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE COUNTRY 
THE DEPORTATION BILL IF THEY CAN 
FIND THEM COULD RUN TO AN 
ESTIMATED FIVE BILLION 
ANDREW JOINS US NOW 
INTERESTING THINGS COME OUT OF THAT 
FOR EXAMPLE THE EMPLOYERS SAYING 
IT IS HARD FOR THEM TO KNOW 
YES IT IS ALTHOUGH THE U. K. BORDERS 
AGENCY PROVIDES A PHONE NUMBER AND 
LITERATURE TELLING EMPLOYERS HOW 
THEY CAN CHECK IF THEY HAVE 
SUSPICIONS ABOUT SOMEONE IF 
SOMEONE COMES ALONG WITH PAPERS YOU 
CAN PHONE UP AND CHECK IF THIS 
PERSON IS LEGAL OR ILLEGAL BUT IT 
IS DIFFICULT FOR MANY EMPLOYERS 
WHEN THEY WENT INTO THIS AND THE 
CRACKDOWN WERE THEY EXPECTING TO 
CATCH AS MANY PEOPLE AND FIND SO 
MANY ILLEGAL WORKERS 
IT HAS BEEN A 
SURPRISE FOR THE GOVERNMENT THEY 
HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF 
OPERATIONS FORTY PER CENT MORE OPERATIONS 
THEY HAVE BEEN SURPRISED HOW 
EFFICIENT THIS CHANGE IN THE LAW 
HAS BEEN IT IS A FAST TRACK FORM 
OF JUSTICE AND A WAY OF HANDING OUT 
FINES QUICKLY AND THEY ARE HOPING 
THAT WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF 
GETTING THE MESSAGE ACROSS 
THANK YOU UNSUITABLE AND DANGEROUS 
CONVICTS ARE BEING SENT TO OPEN 
PRISONS TO HELP SOLVE THE 
OVERCROWDING CRISIS THAT'S THE 
CLAIM BEING MADE BY LEADING PRISON 
OFFICERS THEY HAVE TOLD THE B. B. C. 
THAT ONCE IN SOME CRIMINALS ARE 
JUST WALKING OUT AND IT IS PUTTING 
PUBLIC SAFETY AT RISK 
THIS IS RICHARD MCDONALD A MAN WITH 
A VIOLENT CRIMINAL HISTORY AND 
KNOWN TO THE POLICE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR C. 
C. C. C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE SHOWS MCDONALD AND 
AN ACCOMPLICE ROBBING SYDENHAM 
RAILWAY STATION THEY FOLLOW STAFF 
INTO THE CASH AUFLS WHILE ONE ONE 
BEATS A MAN WITH A GUN ANOTHER 
HOLDS A BUTCHER'S KNIFE TO 
WOMAN'S THROAT THEY LEAVE WITH 
EIGHT THOUSAND WHEN THE POLICE REVIEWED 
THE FOOTAGE THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE 
WHAT THEY WERE SEEING 
THE THE C. C. C. C. T. V. WAS SHOWN TO ONE OF 
THE OFFICERS THAT WAS ON THE SQUAD 
IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND HE IDENTIFIED THE 
ROBBER ROBBER AS BEING MR. MCDONALD 
WHICH WAS SURPRISING BECAUSE WE 
BELIEVED HE WAS IN PRISON SERVING 
FOR ROBBERIES ON THE RAILWAY AT 
THAT TIME 
IN FACT MCDONALD HAD BEEN 
TRANSFERRED TO FORD OPEN PRISON IN 
WEST SUSSEX HE HAD SIMPLY WALKED 
OUT PRISON OFFICERS SAY THE 
TRANSFER OF UNSUITABLE PRISONERS IS 
A TREND THAT'S PUTTING THE PUBLIC 
AT RISK 
THERE IS NO DOUBT FROM THE 
INFORMATION I'M RECEIVING FROM 
MEMBERS THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE 
WRONG PRISONERS THE WRONG INMATES 
THE WRONG OFFENDERS WHATEVER 
EXPRESSION YOU WANT TO USE INTO 
THE OPEN STATE THAT'S BEEN CAUSED 
BY THE OVERCROWDING SITUATION WE 
HAVE BOTH IN SCOTLAND AND IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES 
WITH RECORD U. K. PRISON POP LAKES 
OF OVER NINETY THOUSAND HARRY FLETCHER OF 
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
PROBATION IS ALSO CONCERNED 
I CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN WORRIED FOR 
FIFTEEN OR EIGHTEEN MONTHS THAT INDIVIDUALS 
WERE BEING TRANSFERRED INTO OPEN 
JAILS IN ENGLAND AND WALES WHO DID 
POSE A RISK TO THE PUBLIC AND THE 
REASON I BELIEVE THAT IS BECAUSE 
MEMBERS OF MY ORGANISATION WORKING 
IN PRISONS AND IN THE COMMUNITY 
HAVE TOLD ME THAT THAT IS THE CASE 
IN A STATEMENT JUSTICE SECRETARY 
JACK STRAW INSISTED THAT PUBLIC 
SAFETY WAS PARAMOUNT BUT THOSE AT 
THE COAL FACE REMAIN WORRIED THAT 
CASES LIKE THAT OF RICHARD MCDONALD 
WILL OCCUR AGAIN 
YOU CAN SEE MORE ON THAT

GIVE ME THE ORGANS BACK THEY HAVE 
NEVER HAD TO DO IT BEFORE SO THEY 
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROCEDURE IS 
WHY DID THEY HOLD BACK CERTAIN 
ORGANS OF YOUR DAUGHTER AT THE 
TIME WHAT'S THE BACKGROUND 
BECAUSE SHE HAD TWO AUTOPSIES BUT 
THERE IS NOT A LOT OF 
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE FORENSIC 
TEAMS AND THE FORENSICS IN GOA THE 
PEOPLE IN BOMBAY HAVE BEEN SAYING 
THEY ONLY NEED A SMALL AMOUNT AND 
THEY TAKE HUGE AMOUNTS AND SEND IT 
THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION 
AS SCARLET'S MOTHER WHAT DOES THIS 
REALLY MEAN FOR YOU HOW ARE YOU 
ABLE TO DEAL WITH LOSING YOUR 
DAUGHTER IN THIS SITUATION WHICH IS 
QUITE REMARKABLE ISN'T IT 
I JUST 
JUST THINK IT IS AGAINST THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS TO TAKE SO MUCH OF HER AWAY 
AND NOT GIVE ME THE OPTION OF WHAT 
I WANT DOING WITH THE REST OF HER 
BODY L. WOULD LIKE IT BACK TO BURY 
HER ENTIRE AND I WOULD LIKE THE 
BITS BACK FOR THEM TO BE TESTED IN

DAUGHTER THERE IS THE WHOLE 
EMOTIONAL JOURNEY I'M SURE THAT 
HAD AN IMPACTEN YOU TO GO ON YOU 
TO GO BACK TO WHERE IT HAPPENED AND 
DID YOU LOOK BACK AT IT AND DID 
ANYTHING GO THROUGH YOUR MIND ABOUT 
WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE 
DIFFERENTLY 
NOT ON THIS JOURNEY DIFFERENTLY THOSE THINGS GO THROUGH YOUR MIND 
WHEN YOU FIRST LOSE A CHILD L. 
WASN'T 
GOING BACK ON HOLIDAY L. WAS GOING BACK TO SEE PEOPLE AND TO 
DEAL WITH OFFICIALS SO IT WAS A 
DIFFERENT TRIP

WITH THIS FIGHT TO GET SCARLETT'S 
ORGANS BACK 
I HAVE TO KEEP THE 
PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT TO DO 
SOMETHING L. WOULD LIKE JUSTICE FOR 
MY DAUGHTER'S MURDER L. WOULD LIKE 
TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HER L. 
WOULD LIKE THE ORGANS BACK AND I 
WOULD LIKE TO MAKE CHANGES SO OTHER 
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK THIS

THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
A BILL RUNNING TO BILLIONS THE 
RISING COST OF OF SENDING WORKERS 
WORKERS HOME FOLLOWING A CLAMP DOWN 
ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS INMATES ARE 
BEING SENT TO OPEN JAILS TO STOP 
OVERCROWDING OVERCROWDING WHY BUY ONE GET ONE FREE ARE BEING 
SHELVED AS THE THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
BITES 
NOW LET'S LOOK AT THE BANK HOLIDAY 
WEATHER WEATHER IT'S NOT LOOKING TOO BAD FOR MANY 
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TODAY HOWEVER 
HAVING SAID THAT IT IS A CHILLY 
START TO THE DAY IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND PARTS OF WALES AND THE 
SOUTH WEST AND FOR THE REST OF US 
IT IS FAIRLY HUMID AND THERE IS 
SOME RAIN AROUND FOR WEE WHILE YET YET YOU CAN SEE THIS GREAT LUMP OF 
CLOUD EXTENDING OVER ENGLAND WHICH 
IS PRODUCING THE RAIN SO IT IS 
LOVELY OVER THE SOUTH EASTERN 
CORNER OF ENGLAND BUT TOWARDS THE 
MIDLANDS AND FURTHER NORTH WE'RE 
INTO THE RAIN BUT NOT EVERYWHERE 
FOR THE FAR NORTH OF ENGLAND THERE 
IS SUNSHINE TO ENJOY AND A LITTLE 
CLOUD SCOTLAND IS SEEING A LITTLE 
CLOUD BUT IT IS NOT A COLD START 
AND THE FOG AND MISTS ONE LAPPING 
AROUND THE SHORES ALSO FOG LAPPING 
AROUND THE SHORES OF NORTHERN 
IRELAND BUT INLAND IT IS 
DIVORGEIOUS IN THE IRISH 
GORGEOUS IN THE IRISH SEA AND THE 
COASTS OF WALES THERE IS SOME FOG 
BUT INLAND WALES WILL HAVE BRIGHTER 
SPELLS THROUGH THE DAY YOU CAN 
SEE THE RAIN PUSHING IN THE 
DIRECTION OF WALES AND THE SOUTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND AS WELL AS THE 
NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND PRECEDED BY 
SHOWERS WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO 
BE THUNDERY BUT ON EITHER SIDE 
WE'RE LOOKING AT SUNNY SKIES WITH 
HEALTHY SEVENTY THREE FAHRENHEIT OR TWENTY THREE 
CELSIUS CELSIUS THROUGH THE NIGHT THE PATCHY CLOUD 
WILL BREAK AND TOMORROW MORNING 
WILL BE A GLORIOUS START TO THE DAY 
AND ANY PATCHES OF MIST OR FOG 
OVERNIGHT WILL BE LOST THE 
EXCEPTION WILL THE NORTHERN IRELAND 
WHERE THERE WILL BE A BIT MORE 
CLOUD AROUND AND WEDNESDAY IS A 
REPEAT PERFORMANCE WITH LOTS OF 
SUNSHINE THE ODD SHOWER MIGHT 
PRODUCE THE ODD CLOUD MIGHT PRODUCE LITTLE SHOWER BUT 
NOTHING SIGNIFICANT 
AND IT IS GOING TO BE SUNNY FOR 
MOST ON WEDNESDAY WITH HIGHS OF TWENTY FOUR 
OR TWENTY FIVE BY THE END OF THE WEEK AND 
TWENTY FIVE IS SEVENTY FIVE IN FAHRENHEIT 
DETAILS OF THE FIRST BATCH OF NEW 
G. P. PRACTISES WHICH WILL ALLOW 
PATIENTS TO VISIT DURING EVENINGS 
AND WEEKENDS WILL BE ANNOUNCED 
LATER TODAY IT IS THE LATEST STAGE 
OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OVERHAUL OF 
PRIMARY CARE IT WILL ALSO 
INTRODUCE POLYCLINICS WHICH ARE 
SURGERIES HOUSING OTHER SERVICES 
SUCH AS SOCIAL CARE BUT THE 
BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS 
WORRIED THAT SOME G. P.'S WILL LOSE OUT 
THROUGH THE CHANGES BEN BRADSHAW 
THE HEALTH MINISTER IS WITH US THIS 
MORNING CAN YOU CLARIFY WHAT ARE 
THE CHANGES 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 
THINGS WE'RE INTRODUCING AN EXTRA 
TRANCHE OF G. P.'S IN SOME PLACES WHERE 
THERE HAVE BEEN FEWER G. P.'S ACROSS 
THE POPULATION 
AND THESE ARE 
CONVENTIONAL SURGERIES 
YES WE 
MADE THE MAIN ANNOUNCEMENT LAST 
AUTUMN BUT WE HAVE SO THE MONEY 
LEFT OVER SO WE'RE GOING TO EXTEND 
THE AREAS THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM 
THIS AND THE OTHER ANNOUNCEMENT 
WILL BE NEW MONEY TO SPEND ON SOME 
OF THE CONDITIONS AND PREVENTATIVE 
MEDICINE SO HEART FAILURE LIVER 
PROBLEMS AND IT IS MANYLY ABOUT 
PREVENTING PEOPLE GETTING ILL IN 
THE FIRST PLACE RATHER THAN 
TREATING THEM ONCE THEY ARE ILL 
AND THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS TODAY ARE 
NOT LINKED TO THE BIGGER 
POLYCLINICS 
NO THAT WAS SEPARATE POLYCLINICS WHEN WE ANNOUNCED BACK IN THE 
AUTUMN NEW MONEY FOR A HEALTH 
CENTRE OR POLYCLINIC THAT WILL BE 
OPEN SEVEN DAYS A WEEKEND AND TWELVE 
HOURS A DAY SO THAT BUSY PEOPLE 
HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO SEE A G. P. AT 
THE EVENINGS OR WEEKENDS AND THAT 
IS GOING AHEAD AND THAT IS A 
PROGRAMME WHERE LOCAL HEALTH 
AUTHORITIES ARE OUT IN CONSULTATION 
IN CERTAIN AREAS WHERE IT IS BEING 
TRIED AND THAT WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN 
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS 
AND GORDON BROWN HAS BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT HEALTH PLANS IN THE COMING 
DAYS AND YOU WERE GLANCING ACROSS 
THE NEWSPAPERS THERE GRIM TIMES 
FOR GORDON BROWN AT THE MOMENT BUT 
HE CAME OUT YESTERDAY AND SAID I'M 
RESPONSIBLE I'M TO BLAME FOR WHAT 
HAS HAPPENED TO THE VOTE FOR HIS 
PARTY DO YOU THINK HE IS TO BLAME 
I THINK WHEN YOU'RE PRIME MINISTER 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE RAP WHEN YOU 
DO BADLY IN ELECTIONS BUT 
HISTORICALLY GOVERNMENTS DO TEND TO 
DO BADLY AT TIMES L. THINK GORDON 
BROWN WHO IS AFTER ALL PROBABLY 
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL CHANCELLOR 
WE'VE HAD IN A GENERATION IS THE 
RIGHT MAN TO TAKE US THROUGH THAT 
AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NOISES OFF 
IN SOME OF THE NEWSPAPERS I'M 
GETTING ON WITH THE JOB OF THE 
HEALTH CARE OF THE COUNTRY WHAT WHAT HAS HE GOT WRONG YOU'RE SAYING HE 
ONE TO BLAME HE'S RESPONSIBLE 
NO I 
DIDN'T SAY THAT I SAID IF YOU'RE 
LEADER YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE RAP IF 
YOU RUN A COMPANY OR A GOVERNMENT 
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE 
WHICH IS THE 
BIT HE'S GETTING WRONG 
HE HAS BEEN 
PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT THE TEN P. TAX 
RATE WAS A MISTAKE AND NOT HANDLED 
VERY WELL AND WE HAVE TO STAY CALM 
AND HAVE TO KEEP WORKING ON WHAT WE 
WERE ELECTED TO DO WHICH WAS TO 
DELIVER BETTER SERVICES AND A 
STABLE ECONOMY FOR THE COUNTRY OUR 
ECONOMY HAS OUTPERFORMED EVERY 
OTHER MAJOR ECONOMY IN THE PAST TEN 
OR ELEVEN YEARS WE HAVE A DIFFICULT 
ECONOMIC BACK DROP ACROSS THE AREA 
AT THE MOMENT AND I THINK HE IS 
DOING A BETTER JOB 
CAN YOU TELL ME 
THERE ARE NOT CONVERSATIONS GOING 
ON BEHIND THE SCENES AMONGST 
LABOUR M. P.'S ABOUT CHANGES IN THE 
LEADERSHIP CAN YOU HONESTLY TELL 
ME THAT IS NOT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW 
CHARLIE I CAN TELL YOU WILL ALWAYS 
HEAR NOISES OFF AND CHATTING OF 
ONE SORT OR ANOTHER BUT I AND MY 
COLLEAGUES ARE GETTING ON WITH THE 
JOBS IN HAND 
SO YOU'RE SAYING 
THERE ARE JUST ONE OR TWO HAVING 
THESE CONVERSATIONS IS THERE NOT A 
GROUND SWELL ABOUT THIS MAN 
ABSOLUTELY NOT THERE IS STRONG 
FEELING THAT GORDON BROWN IS THE 
RIGHT PERSON TO TAKE US FORWARD 
HE'S THE MOST SUCCESSFUL CHANCELLOR 
IN MODERN TIMES AND HE ONE THE RIGHT 
PERSON WITH HIS HAND ON THE TILLER 
THROUGH ECONOMIC TURBULENCE AND 
WHEN PEOPLE LOOK BACK ON THIS 
THEY'LL SAY HE WAS THE RIGHT PERSON 
IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND IF YOU LOOK 
AT THE ALTERNATIVE I DON'T THINK 
IT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE ONE 
AND A LOOK AT THE PAPERS THIS 
MORNING A LOT ON GORDON BROWN THE 
PRONT PAGE OF THE INDEPENDENT 
FRONT PAGE OF THE INDEPENDENT 
SAYING WHY I SHOULD STAY IN MY 
JOB AND DESCRIBING GORDON BROWN 
HAS CONTRITE 
AND THE TELEGRAPH HAS A LOVELY 
PICTURE OF THE QUEEN ON A MINIATURE 
RAILWAY AND NOBODY KNEW SHE WAS 
THERE AND SHE IS ENJOYING A RIDE ON 
THE TRAIN THERE 
AND IT ALSO HAS THE REVOLT IN 
LABOUR AND IF YOU'RE SUFFERING 
FROM OBESITY BUT CAN'T WORK OUT WHY 
THE DAILY EXPRESS ARE COVERING A 
STORY ON BRITISH SCIENTISTS WHO SAY 
THAT A LOT OF EXPERTS ARE EXCITED 
ABOUT IT IS A FAT GENE THAT 
APPARENTLY HALF OF US 
IN THE 
U. K. AND IT IS VITAL TO TACKLE 
OBESITY IN THIS COUNTRY 
DOZENS OF WIND AND WATER MILLS IN 
THIS COUNTRY ARE LITERALLY ROTTING 
AWAY BECAUSE OF A LACK OF EXPERTS 
TO MAINTAIN THEM FIVE HUNDRED ARE STILL 
WORKING AND SOME ARE PRODUCING 
FLOUR BUT FOR HOW LONG WE'VE BEEN 
TO NORFOLK TO MEET ONE OF THE 
MILLWRIGHTS WHO ARE LEARNING HOW TO 
KEEP THESE OLD MILLS CHURNING OVER 
PAUL HERE IS A RAREITY A TRAINEE 
MILLWRIGHT 
I GET MIXED REACTIONS REALLY ONE 
OF MY FRIENDS THOUGHT I WAS GOING 
TO BE WORKING A MILLING MACHINE FOR 
A LONG TIME NO THEY MANYLY THINK 
I'M CRAZY BUT THINK THEY ALWAYS 
HAVE HAVE WE'RE IN NORFOLK AND ALONG WITH 
THE ECCENTRIC WILDLIFE THESE 
BUILDINGS ARE AN ICONIC PART OF 
THIS AREA BUT THERE IS A FIVE YEAR 
WAITING LIST TO DO THEM UP BECAUSE 
OF A LACK OF EXPERTS TO CARRY OUT 
THE WORK PAUL'S TRAINING IS BEING 
PAID FOR BY LOTTERY MONEY BUT IT 
IS STILL A DYING SKILL 
I WANT TO 
LEARN ABOUT EVERYTHING WHEN YOU 
SEE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
WORKING ON IT ALL THEIR LIVES AND 
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO DIE AND 
NOBODY IS GOING TO TAKE IT ON I 
THINK IT IS SADS 
VINCENT HAS BEEN 
DOING THIS SINCE THE ZEROS HE IS SIXTY FOUR 
NOW AND LOOKING TO WIND THINGS DOWN 
A BIT BUT HE HAS JOBS ON ALL OVER 
THE WORLD ESSEX JERUSALEM AND UP 
MENSTER 
IT IS ENERGY AND YOU NEED MENSTER TO BE STRONG AND FIT AND WE'RE 
GETTING A BIT PAST IT NOW 
BUT IS THERE REALLY FUTURE IN IT 
VINCENT THINKS SO 
JUDGING BY THE 
PAST TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY YEARS I'VE BEEN 
WORKING I'VE NEVER BEEN REALLY 
SHORT OF WORK AND I THINK THAT WILL 
CONTINUE BECAUSE IT IS A SPECIALIST 
JOB AND YOU NEED SPECIALIST TO DO 
IT WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE 
DOING 
NOW THE LATEST BUSINESS NEWS FROM 
DECLAN WHO IS IN FRANCE AND YOU'RE 
CAMPING CAMPING CHARLIE WE'RE NOT DOING THE LATEST 
BUSINESS NEWS TODAY WHAT WE ARE 
DOING IS TAKING A STEP BACK TO LOOK 
AT THE ONE THING THAT WILL BE ON 
THE MINDS OF ANYONE PLANNING A 
SUMMER HOLIDAY OR WHO IS ALREADY ON 
A MINI BREAK FOR THE BANK HOLIDAY 
AND THAT IS THE STARK FACT THAT THE 
POUND IS NOT GOING AS FAR AS IT 
ONCE DID ON THE CONTINENT THERE 
HAS BEEN A STRONG RISE IN THE VALUE 
OF THE EURO OVER THE PAST YEAR IT 
IS UP BY SOME SEVENTEEN PER CENT AND THE POUND 
LAST MONTH HIT RECORD LOWS AGAINST 
THE EURO THE LOWEST VALUE WE HAVE 
EVER SEEN IT MEANS YOUR HOLIDAY ON 
THE CONTINENT THIS YEAR IS GOING TO 
BE THAT LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE 
THAN LAST YEAR WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
FOR BRITS ON HOLIDAY AND THE FRENCH 
TOURISM INDUSTRY ANNA BELL IS WITH 
ME FROM THE LOCAL TOURST BOARD I'M 
NOT GOING TO ATTEMPT THE FORMAL 
NAME OF YOUR ORGANISATION BECAUSE 
I KNOW I'LL GET IT WRONG BUT IF 
YOU THINK OF WHERE BRITS GO WHEN 
THEY COME TO FRANCE THIS IS NOT 
ONE OF THE REASONS YOU 
AUTOMATICALLY THINK OF 
YES OF 
COURSE FIRST OF ALL WE ARE 
SITUATED CLOSE TO PARIS WE ARE 
ONE AND A HALF HOURS FROM PARIS 
AND WE HAVE AN HISTORICAL PAST WITH 
WORLD WAR ONE AND WE HAVE A WIDE 
RANGE OF ACCOMMODATION A LOT OF

HOW MUCH BETTER YOUR FOOD IS THAN 
OURS BUT YOU MENTIONED THE FIRST 
WORLD WAR AND THIS IS CLOSE TO THE 
BATTLE OF THE SOMME SOME AND THERE 
WILL BE A LOT OF INTEREST IN IT 
DUE TO THE ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR

INTEREST AND THERE IS A DRAGON 
CAVE AND A LOT OF ENGLISH PEOPLE

THE BUY ONE GET ONE FREE 
PROMOTIONS SEEN IN SUPERMARKETS ARE 
BEING SHELVED WITH LEADING CHAINS 
REPLACING SO CALLED BOGOF OFFERS 
WITH STRAIGHT PRICE CUTS THE MOVE 
COMES AS SHOPPERS STEER AWAY FROM 
UNNECESSARY PURCHASES 
JUDI BEVAN JOINS US 
CAN I TAKE CAN YOU TAKE US 
THROUGH HOW YOUR SUPERMARKET SHOP 
HACE CHANGED 
I MAKE A SHOPPING 
LIST AND MAKE SURE WE ONLY BUY WHAT 
WE WANT 
YOU ARE IMMUNE TO OFFERS AND DEALS 
IF THEY ARE NOTHING THAT WE WOULD 
NORMALLY BUY IF IT IS SOMETHING 
THAT WE WOULD THAT'S ON MY LIST 
AND IT LOOKS OR IT IS A SIMILAR 
ITEM I MAY LOOK AT IT AND SAY WE 
WILL HAVE THAT ONE THIS WEEK BUT 
IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT 
NECESSARY THAT I KNOW THE KIDS WILL 
EAT OR IT IS JUST LET'S THRI IT OUT 
TRY IT OUT IT DOESN'T GO THE 
BASKET BASKET IS THIS BAD OR GOOD FOR THE 
CONSUMER 
I THINK THE SUPERMARKETS CONSUMER ARE RESPONDING TO CONSUMER DEMAND 
AND CONSUMERS ARE GETTING SAVVY AND 
ARE WATCHING AS DAWN SAYS 
THE PROBLEM WITH BOGOFS A LOT OF 
PEOPLE REALISE IT HAD WASN'T A GOOD 
DEAL THEY WERE PAYING MORE 
PARTICULARLY IF THEY ONLY WANTED 
ONE BAG OF ORANGES RATHER THAN TWO 
AND THEY WERE PAYING MORE FOR THE 
ONE BAG THAN IF THEY BOUGHT TWO 
THEY WERE BEING PUT IN A DIFFICULT 
POSITION 
SAY FOR EXAMPLE YOU BUY A POSITION PACKET OF BISCUITS THAT YOU WOULD 
NORMALLY BUY AND THAT IS BUY ONE 
GET ONE FREE THAT'S IS A NO 
BRAINER YOU ARE UP ON THE DEAL IF 
THEY ARE TAKING THE DEALS AWAY YOU 
ARE GOING TO SPEND MORE 
NO THEY 
WILL PROBABLY CUT THE PRICE 
WHAT TO HALF THE PRICE 
IT WOULDN'T 
HAVE BEEN HALF THE PRICE ANYWAY 
THEY HAVE WOULD HAVE JACKED UP THE 
PRICE OF THE INDIVIDUAL ITEM AND 
THEN SAID BY ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT AND SAID IT 
IS BUY ONE GET ONE FREE YOU HAVE 
GOT AN ORIGINAL STARTING PRICE BUT 
WITH FRESH PRODUCE IT IS DIFFERENT 
IF YOU ARE ACTUALLY THOUGHT I 
BETTER BUY TWO BECAUSE OTHERWISE I 
WILL BE STUNG BY ONLY BUYING ONE 
YOU ENUP THROWING HALF THE ORANGES 
AWAY AWAY IT IS MAKING PEOPLE WISE UP ABOUT 
WASTE 
I THINK IT DOES YOUR WASTE BISCUITS YOU WOULD BUY FOUR 
PACKETS PACKETS YES YES I'M LAUGHING NOW 
YOU WOULD BUY THAT TWICE BECAUSE 
THE KIDS WOULD EAT THAT BUT THAT'S 
NOT GOOD 
WITH ALL THIS DAY TO DAY AND HOW 
MUCH TIME DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO 
WORK OUT WHICH SUPERMARKET IS DOING 
WHAT 
IT DOESN'T AT ALL L. I TEND WHAT TO SHOP IN ONE SUPERMARKET BECAUSE 
IT IS CLOSE TO ME AND FITS IN WITH 
MY BUSY WORKING LIFE BUT IF I CAN 
GET INTO THE OTHER SUPERMARKETS I'M 
CONSCIOUS NOW AND I AM AWARE OF 
WHAT IS ON THE SHELVES AND WHAT IS 
CHEAPER CHEAPER HOW MUCH ARE YOU SAVING 
I CAN SAVE 
BETWEEN TWENTY TO THIRTY A WEEK BETWEEN 
SUPERMARKETS SUPERMARKETS THAT'S LOT YES YES ARE PEOPLE DOING THAT ARE THEY 
REALLY SHOPPING AROUND 
YES WE ARE 
SEEING CUSTOMERS TRADING DOWN TO 
LIDL AND ICELAND AND THE CUT PRICE 
THE CHEAP END OF THE MARKET AND IN 
THE LAST THREE MONTHS THE TNS 
FIGURES SHOWED THOSE WERE MAKING 
BIG MARKET SHARE GAINS AS PEOPLE 
ARE YOU KNOW GETTING WISE AND 
WANTING TO SAVE MONEY 
ARE THEY BUYING THE SAME THINGS IN 
DIFFERENT STORES OR ARE THEY 
BUYING OWN BRAND THINGS THAT ARE 
CHEAPER 
SOMETIMES THEY ARE BUYING CHEAPER OWN BRAND THEY ARE NOTICING THEIR 
BILL AND YOU NOTICE AT THE CHECKOUT 
IT IS WHEN YOU REALLY NOTICE AND 
YOU THINK OH IN SOME SUPERMARKETS 
YOU THINK THAT'S CHEAP AND IN OTHER 
SUPERMARKETS YOU THINK OUCH 
THANK YOU

HOW IS THE WEATHER GOING TO BE 
CAROL CAROL W. ELL FOR MANY OF US IT IS LOOKING 
QUITE PLEASANT 
J. B. HOWEVER FOR SOME OF US THERE IS 
RAIN AROUND YOU CAN SEE IN THE 
SATELLITE PICTURE THE BIG LUMP OF 
CLOUD WHICH HAS BEEN MOVING AWAY 
BUT IS STILL RESTING ACROSS PARTS 
OF ENGLAND AND WALES AND THAT IS 
PRODUCING THE RAIN AT THE MOMENT 
IN THE SOUTH EASTERN CORNER THERE 
IS LOVELY SUNSHINE TO ENJOY BY NINE A M. 
AND NOT COLD START BY ANY STRETCH 
FROM THE MIDLANDS HEADING NORTH 
INTO DERBYSHIRE LANCASHIRE AND 
MANCHESTER TOO THERE IS RAIN 
AROUND BUT FURTHER NORTH IN 
SCOTLAND THERE IS LOVELY SUNSHINE 
AROUND BUT CLOSE TO THE COASTS 
THERE IS SEA FOG LAPPING THE SHORES 
AT TIMES INLAND IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND IT WILL BE LOVELY THIS 
MORNING IN WALES CLOSE TO THE 
COASTS THERE IS SEA FOG AND PATCHY 
MIST AND FOG AROUND BUT INLAND 
THERE IS LOVELY SEASON SHINE AND 
CLOSE TO THE SOUTH WEST COASTS 
THERE IS FOG LAPPING THE SHORES 
BUT INLAND SEASON SHEEN AND THAT 
BAND OF RAIN CONTINUES TO JOURNEY 
UP TO THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND 
THE WEST OF WALES BUT FOR THE 
SOUTH EAST AND SCOTLAND AND 
NORTHERN IRELAND INLAND WE'RE 
LOOKING AT LOVELY DAY 
AND TEMPERATURES ARE WELL ABOVE THE 
AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR 
THIS EVENING THAT BAND OF RAIN 
PETERS OUT ACROSS SCOTLAND AND 
NORTHERN IRELAND LEAVING 
BEAUTIFUL START TO THE DAY TOMORROW 
FOR MANY OF US AFTER THE PATCHY 
MIST AND FOG CLEARS TEMPERATURES 
TWENTY TWO AT BEST IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
TEMPERATURES ARE FOURTEEN UNDER A LITTLE 
MORE CLOUD AND ON WEDNESDAY 
ANOTHER GLORIOUS DAY AFTER WE LOSE 
THE MIST AND FOG AROUND THERE WILL 
BE A LOT OF SUNSHINE AND TOP 
TEMPERATURE OF TWENTY TWO IN MANCHESTER 
THAT'S SEVENTY TWO FAHRENHEIT THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY ARE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD TOO 
WITH THE TEMPERATURES CLIMBING THAT 
LITTLE BIT HIGHER SO IF YOU'RE 
TAKEN THIS WEEK OFF YOU'RE IN 
CLOVER CLOVER THATCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CHEAP 
HOLIDAY CAMPING BUT DECLAN IS 
WITH SOME CAMPERS IN FRANCE 
FINDING OUT WHAT IT IS LIKE IF YOU 
THINK I SPENT THE NIGHT IN THIS 
TENT YOU DON'T KNOW ME I'M NOW 
STUCK STUCK I KNEW THAT WOULD HAPPEN WE'RE IN 
THE NORTH EAST OF PARIS IN THE 
PICARDIE REGION IT IS VERY HANDY 
FOR BRITS STAYING HERE WHO ARE 
GOING TO EURODISNEY AND THERE ARE 
A LOT OF BRITS ON THIS HOLIDAY CAMP 
THIS WEEKEND AND THE ONE THING 
THEY'VE ALL NOTICED IS THAT IT IS 
BIT MORE EXPENSIVE THIS YEAR THAN 
LAST YEAR BECAUSE THE POUND IS NOT 
GOING AS FAR AS IT USED TO 
STERLING REACHED THE LOW EST 
AGAINST THEURE E. O. SO IT MEANS 
HOLIDAYS ON THE CONTINENT ARE 
LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN LAST 
YEAR YEAR IT IS THE MOST FAMOUS ANTIQUITY IN 
THE WORLD THE ACROPOLIS IN ATHENS 
BUT ARE THE PRICES MONDAYMENTIAL 
LAST YEAR IT WOULD HAVE COST SEVEN POINT NINE TWO 
TO GO UP THERE THIS YEAR IT IS 
NINE POINT THREE SIX AND ALL BECAUSE OF THE 
STRONGER EURO 
HOW ABOUT THE TOWER OF PISA LAST 
YEAR IT INCLINED TOWARDS THE 
AFFORDABLE AT NINE POINT NINE OH PERSON THIS 
YEAR THE TILT IS RATHER MORE 
EXTREME AT ELEVEN POINT SEVEN OH BUT IF THAT IS 
THE COST OF EXPERIENCING AN 
OVERHANG HOW ABOUT A HANGOVER 
LUCKILY THE PRICE OF BEER IN 
SPAIN IS STILL PRETTY LOW LAST 
YEAR AROUND SIXTY SIX P. THIS YEAR SEVENTY EIGHT P. AND 
AFTER A FEW OF THEM YOU PROBABLY 
WON'T NOTICE THAT SORT OF 
DIFFERENCE ANY WAY BUT WHERE CAN 
YOU GO WHERE YOUR POUND IS STILL 
SOUND 
YOU ONE TO LEAVE THE EUROZONE SOUND TURKEY HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN GOOD 
VALUE BUT THE HIGH PRICE OF OIL 
MEANS IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO GET 
THERE BULGARIA IS LOOKING CHEAP AS 
IS CROATIA BUT FOR THE LOWEST 
PRICES IN EUROPE I'VE FOUND YOU 
HAVE TO CROSS THE BORDER INTO 
SERBIA TREMENDOUS VALUE AND THEY 
WON'T LAUGH AT YOUR POUND 
FOR EXAMPLE THE PRICE OF A COFFEE 
IN SERBIA CAN BE AS LOW AS FIFTY P. OR 
STAYING OVERNIGHT IN A HOSTEL IN 
BELGRADE CAN COST YOU SEVEN THAT AND'S 
INCLUDING BREAKFAST 
BACK IN THE EUROZONE REMEMBER 
THERE HAS BEEN INFLATION TOO SO 
LAST YEAR A RIDE IN THE LIFT UP 
THE EIFFEL TOWER WOULD HAVE COST 
YOU SEVEN POINT FIVE NINE BUT THIS YEAR IT HAS 
GONE SKY HIGH AT NINE POINT THREE SIX SO THIS 
SUMMER YOU CAN SPOT THE BRITISH 
THEY ARE THE ONES TAKING THE STAIRS 
O. K. FINISHED NOW 
RIGHT BRIAN THANK YOU A HOST OF 
PEOPLE ALL EARLY MORNING RISERS ON 
THE CAMP SITE YOU PEOPLE ARE ON 
HOLIDAY WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU

AND WE HAVE LESLEY AND KEITH FROM 
SOIMP TON AND CHIST AND KEITH 
BESIDE THEM SOUTHAMPTON THEY'VE 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE RISE IN THE 
VALUE OF THE EURO WHICH MAKES 
HOLIDAYS FOR BRITS THAT BIT MORE 
EXPENSIVE ON THE CONTINENT HAVE 
EITHER OF YOU NOTICED IT IN YOUR 
POCKETS THIS YEAR 
YES WE HAVE IS IS THERE MUCH YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT NO NO WE JUST HAVE TO PAY IT BUT IT WAS 
DEFINITELY CHEAPER LAST YEAR IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO SPOIL OUR HOLIDAY 
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SPOIL OUR 
HOLIDAY THINGS ARE SLIGHTLY MORE 
EXPENSIVE BUT YOU STILL HAVE A GOD 
TIME AND IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT YOU 
DON'T BUY IT AND ONCE YOU'RE 
BOOKED YOU'RE IN 
STEVE LANE YOU ARE FROM VAN VASE 
HOLIDAYS ONE OF THE HOLIDAY 
COMPANIES ON THIS CARAVAN SITE 
CANVAS HOLIDAYS YOU WOULD SAY 
YOU'RE ONE OF THE BETTER VALUE 
HOLIDAYS BUT EVEN PEOPLE STAYING 
WITH YOU ARE NOTICING THE PINCH 
YES THEY DO BUT LIKE YOU SAY 
THE HOLIDAYS HERE ARE OF TREMENDOUS 
VALUE WE DID SHOPPING BASKET 
ANALYSIS AND LIVING EXPERIENCES 
HERE ARE TWENTY FIVE PER CENT TO THIRTY PER CENT CHEAPER THAN 
BACK HOME SO IT IS GREAT VALUE BUT 
THE REAL BENEFIT HERE IS THE WHOLE 
WELL BEING YOU GET FROM THE HOLIDAY 
IN ONE OF THESE VILLAGES 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO YOU THANK 
YOU EVERYONE FOR INTERRUPTING 
YOUR HOLIDAY MORE FROM HERE LATER 
SNIM THE POINT ABOUT YOUR TENT BUT 
IT IS TSH IT IS THE BACK END OF A 
PANTOMIME HORSE IS IT NOT 
NOT SO 
MUCH A HORSE BUT IT IS BOVINE 
THERE IS A VILLAGE NEARBY WHICH 
WHEN TRANSLATED MEANS BLACK CAP 
COW SO THIS WAS THE CLOSEST WE 
THOUGHT WE'D GET TO IT 
FOR YEARS INVESTMENT IN PROPERTY 
HAS BEEN SEEN AS SAFE AS HOUSES 
BUT WITH THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
BEGINNING TO BITE DEVELOPERS AND 
HOMEOWNERS ARE BRACING THEMSELVES 
FOR TIMES AHEAD HALF OF DEVELOPERS 
ARE REPORTING DROP IN TRADE 
COMPARED TO LAST YEAR EMMA HAS 
BEEN LOOKING AT THE EFFECTS OF THE 
SLOWDOWN SHE IS AT THE GRAND 
DESIGNS EXHIBITION AT DOCKLANDS 
THIS MORNING YES HAVE YOU EVER 
FANCIED LIVING IN A LOG CABIN IT 
MIGHT LOOK SLIGHTLY OUT OF PLACE 
FROM SWIDLANDS BUT IT IS ONE OF 
SWITZERLAND BUT IT IS ONE OF THE 
EXHIBITS HERE AT THE GRAND DESIGNS 
EXHIBITION AND WITH PEOPLE NOT 
SELLING THEIR PROPERTIES AT THE 
MOMENT BUILDERS ARE HAVING TO LOCK 
AT OTHER WAYS TO ATTEMPT THE PUBLIC 
TO INVEST IN PROPERTY SURREY 
BUILDER GARY WEBB HAS YET TO FEEL 
THE BITE FROM HOMEOWNERS TIGHTENING 
THEIR BELT THE OWNERS OF THIS 
HOUSE HAD TO WAIT EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR 
THEIR EXTENSION 
THIS WALL WILL 
COME OUT 
THIS IS THE SMALLEST 
TYPE OF JOB HE UNDERTAKES YET IN A 
COLD CLIMATE HE ADMITS IT COULD 
BECOME A BUSINESS STAPLE WE'VE WE'VE NOTICED A SLIGHT DOWNTURN IN 
INQUIRIES BUT WE HAVE WORK AHEAD 
OF US THIS YEAR PEOPLE TEND TO 
STAY IN PROPERTIES RATHER THAN MOVE 
ON 
BUT PLAYING WITH PROPERTIES ON WILL REMAIN A NATIONAL PASTIME 
ARCHITECT GREG IS UP FOR AN AWARD 
FOR A SHOW HOUSE IN LONDON'S EAST 
END BUT HE CAN UNDERSTAND CLIENTS 
WANTING TO UPGRADE THEIR HOMES 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
STRETCHED AND DON'T HAVE A GREAT 
DEAL OF MONEY BUT THERE ARE A LOT 
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE GAINED A LOT OF 
EQUITY AND DO HAVE MONEY TO SPEND 
ON THEIR PROPERTIES 
SO WHILE 
PEOPLE ARE BATONING DOWN THE 
HATCHES IT IS BATH ROOMS AND 
KITCHENS WHICH BECOME THE FOCUS 
WITH US NOW IS FINANCIAL EXPERT 
MARY RILEY THIS HYPE IS IT REALLY 
HYPE OR ARE CONSUMERS FACING A 
REAL PROBLEM WITH PROPERTY AT THE 
MOMENT SNFLT 
AS FAR AS SELF BUILD 
RENOVATION OR DEVELOPMENT OF 
PROPERTIES IS GOING AT THE MOMENT 
IT IS HYPE PEOPLE WHO ARE BUILDING 
THEIR OWN HOMES ARE WRITING EQUITY 
INTO THE PROPERTY STRAIGHTAWAY 
BETWEEN TWENTY PER CENT AND TWENTY FIVE PER CENT MINIMUM AND IF 
THERE HAPPENS TO BE FIVE SLIGHT 
DOWNTURN THEY ARE PROTECTED YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SELF BUILD THERE BUT 
IS IT A BETTER THING FOR PEOPLE TO 
INVEST IN EXTENSIONS RATHER THAN 
MOVING AT THE MOMENT 
IT DOESN'T 
NECESSARY COME DOWN TO THE BEST 
FORM FOR THEM IT COMES DOWN TO 
WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE POSSIBLY 
FOR SCHOOLING OR EMPLOYMENT AND IT 
IS FEASIBLE FOR THEM TO ADD A LARGE 
EXTENSION ON TO THE PROPERTY AND 
GIVES THEM THE FAMILY HOME THEY 
WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE AND IT 
ALSO SAVES STAMP DUTY 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH YOU WOULD BE HARD 
PRESSED NOT TO SPEND MONEY LOOKING 
AT SOME OF THE BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS 
AROUND HERE I'M ALSO JOINED BY ONE 
OF THE CURATORS FROM THE EXHIBITION 
MAX FRASER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
JOINING US WHAT DO YOU HOPE PEOPLE 
WHO COME HERE WILL GET OUT OF IT 
BE INSPIRED PRESUMABLY 
YES AS 
THE ORGANISERS WE HAVE TO CATER FOR 
TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE COMING TO THE 
SHOW THOSE BUILDING THEIR OWN HOME 
BUT ALSO THOSE LOOKING TO BE 
INSPIRED FOR THEIR OWN HOME I'M IN 
CHARGE OF THE SEMINARS AND WE'VE 
TRIED TO INCLUDE A LOT OF 
SUSTAINABLE MESSAGES IN OUR 
PROGRAMME 
IS DESIGN AFFORDABLE PROGRAMME BECAUSE IT ALL LOOKS LIKE A WORK OF 
ART TO ME 
DESIGN CAN SPAN MANY 
PRICE RANGES IT DOES NOT NEED TO 
COST A FORTUNE AND YOU'LL SEE THAT 
WITHIN THE SHOW THERE ARE THINGS 
THAT ARE AFFORDABLE AND THINGS THAT 
ARE MORE EXPENSIVE OF COURSE IT 
COMES DOWN TO BUDGET BUT I HOPE 
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE PRE CONCEIVED 
IDEA THAT IT IS ALL EXPENSIVE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I THINK I'LL CATCH QUICK SNOOZE 
IN THIS LATER ON 
I LIKE THE LOG CABIN 
COMING UP 
HOW A NEW GENERATION OF 
APPRENTICESHIPS IS KEEPING THE 
SAILS TURNING ON BRITAIN'S WIND

AFTERNOON WERE THAT NOT TO BE THE 
CASE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO STOP

NOT ADVERSARY AFFECT COMMUTERS 
GOING TO WORK ON TUESDAY MORNING 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HELPED TO TACKLE 
THE CAUSES OF ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR 
IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE 
BEING REWARDED BY SOUTHWARK COUNCIL 
WINNERS INCLUDE THE HAY GATE 
RESIDENTS' ASSOCIATION AND PUPILS 
WHO HELP STAMP OUT BULLYING IN 
CLASSROOMS 
WE HAVE EXCELLENT ROLES CLASSROOMS THAT OUR WARDENS AND ANTISOCIAL 
BEHAVIOUR TEAM PLAY BUT IT IS 
IMPORTANT BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITIES 
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR AREA 
AND ARE TRYING TO MAKE A POSITIVE 
CHANGE FOR THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES 
MEDICAL RESEARCHERS IN THE CAPITAL 
ARE TRYING TO RECRUIT PEOPLE BORN 
PREMATURELY TO GAUGE EFFECTS IN 
LATER LIFE ON THE WHOLE BABIES 
DELIVERED EARLY REMAIN LIGHTER ALL 
THEIR LIVES COMPARED TO BABIES BORN 
FULL TERM 
THE WEATHER A CLOUDY START WITH A 
LITTLE RAIN IN THE WEST IT SHOULD 
CLEAR AWAY TO LEAVE SOME SPELLS OF 
VERY WARM SUNSHINE 
THIS THIS IS BREAKFAST CLAMPING DOWN ON 
BOSSES WHO GIVE JOBS TO UL LEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS BUT CAN THE GOVERNMENT 
MEET THE COST OF SENDING WORKERS 
HOME 
FIFTH MAY ALSO AHEAD THIS MORNING 
PRISON OFFICERS SAY DANGEROUS 
CRIMINALS ARE BEING SENT TO OPEN 
PRISONS BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH 
SPACE IN SECURE JAILS IS YOUR 
PROPERTY AS SAFE AS HOUSES AM 
HOOT AT THE GRANT DESIGNS 
EXHIBITION IN LONDON LOOKING AT THE 
EFFECTS OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH ON THE 
HOUSING MARKET 
I AM HOLIDAY MAKERS IF THEY WORK 
OUT WHETHER THE STRONG RUER OWE 
EURO MAKES THEIR HOLIDAY ON THE 
CONTINENT MORE EXPENSIVE IT MAY 
HAVE BENEFIT FOR KING BUT CAN ONE 
FAT LADY PERSUADE US TO TRY 
MEDIEVAL FOOD AND IN WEATHER SOME 
OF US WILL SEE SOME SUNSHINE SOME 
OF US WILL SEE SOME RAIN BUT WHERE 
EVER IT WILL BE WARM FIRST OUR 
MAIN STORY THE B. B. C. CAN EXCLUSIVELY 
REVEAL THAT THERE HAS BEEN 
DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF 
EMPLOYERS BEING PROSECUTED FOR 
HIRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE 
LAST TWO MONTHS SINCE CHANGE IN 
THE LAW ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN BUSINESSS HAVE BEEN 
CAUGHT EMPLOYING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
THAT IS TEN TIMES THE NUMBER CAUGHT 
IN THE WHOLE OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND MORE THAN 
DOUBLE PROSECUTED IN THE PREVIOUS 
TEN YEARS BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS 
FACING A MAJOR PROBLEM IN DEALING 
WITH THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ROUNDED 
UP AND DEPORTING THEM IS COSTING 
BILLIONS BILLIONS AT A CHICK PRISON SESING PLANT IN 
DERBYSHIRE IMMIGRATION OFFICERS AND 
THE POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR ILLEGAL 
IMGRANT 
BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION IMGRANT AGENCY CAN YOU ALL STANDSTILL AND 
GOT YOUR KNIVES DOWN 
SHOCKED SCARED AND CONFUSED FIFTY SIX 
WORKERS ARE LINED UP 
WE ARE TO SEE 
IF ANYBODY IS WORKING ILLEGALLY SO 
IT WILL TAKE A BIT OF TIME BUT WE 
WILL SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU AND FIND 
OUT WHO YOU ARE 
TWENTY TWO WORKERS TURN 
OUT TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT BUT 
THEY ARE NOT THE MAIN FOCUS IN 
OPERATION LIKE THIS THE REAL 
TARGET IS EMPLOYERS EVEN LARGE 
SCALE OPERATION LIKE THIS WILL ONLY 
MAKE THE TINIEST DIFFERENCE TO THE 
HUGE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT IN 
THIS COUNTRY SO THE IDEA IS TO GO 
AFTER THE EMPLOYERS IN THE HOPE 
THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE ALL 
THESE PEOPLE ARE HERE TO WORK IF 
YOU STOP THE WORK YOU REMOVE THE 
PULL FACTOR DRIVING ILL LEL LEGAL 
IMMIGRATION IN EIGHT WEEKS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WORTH OF FINES HAVE BEEN HANDED OUT 
TO SIXTY DIFFERENT BUSINESSES CAUGHT 
HIRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
INVESTIGATIONS ARE CONTINUING INTO 
MORE THAN SEVENTY OTHER EMPLOYERS 
INCLUDING THIS ONE WHERE IT IS YET 
TO BE DECIDED IF THEY HAVE DONE 
ANYTHING WRONG 
THERE ARE DODGY 
EMPLOYERS WHO ARE TRYING TO 
UNDERCUT COMPETITORS AND DRIVE DOWN 
BRITISH WAGES BY EMPLOYING PEOPLE 
ILLEGALLY AND WE HAVE COME UP WITH 
THIS NEW WAY OF TAKING MUCH FASTER 
ON THE SPOT ACTION AGAINST THOSE 
BUSINESSES THAT WILL BREAK THE 
RULES RULES BUT SOME EMPLOYERS BELIEVE THEY 
HAVE BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY THIS 
MAN WAS FINED SIX THOUSAND FOR HIRING 
FOUR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AT ANOTHER 
OF HIS RESTAURANTS 
IF ANYONE 
COMING WITH A BRITISH PASSPORT HOW 
DO I KNOW THIS IS FAKE BRITISH 
PASSPORT L. HAVEN'T GOT ANY MACHINE 
OR ANYTHING 
SO YOU THINK IT IS DIFFICULT FOR 
EMPLOYERS 
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE EMPLOYERS EMPLOYER TO PROVE 
BUT DEALING WITH 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IS PROVING AN 
EXPENSIVE PROBLEM DEPORTING THEM 
COSTS ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND PER PERSON W. 
ROUND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT IN 
THE COUNTRY THE DEPORTATION BILL 
IF THEY CAN FIND THEM COULD RUN TO 
AN ESTIMATED FIVE BILLION 
WE WILL TALK TO THE ORGANISATION 
WHICH DISCOVERED JUST HOW EXPENSIVE 
THE DEPORTATION PROCESS IS IN JUST 
A FEW MINUTES 
NOW UNSUITABLE AND DANGEROUS 
CONVICTED ARE BEING SENT TO OPEN 
PRISONS TO HELP SOV THE 
OVERCROWDING CRISIS THAT IS A CLAIM 
MADE BY LEADING PRISON OFFICERS 
THEY HAVE SOLD THE B. B. C. ONCE IN SOME 
CRIMINALS ARE JUST WALKING OUT AND 
IT IS PUTTING PUBLIC SAFETY AT RISK 
IN IS RICHARD MCDONALD A MAN WA 
VIOLENT CRIMINAL HISTORY AND KNOWN 
TO THE POLICE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR C. C. T. V. 
FOOTAGE SHOWS HIM AND AN ACCOMPLICE 
ROBBING SYDENHAM RAILWAY STATION IN 
LONDON THEY TOLL LOW CASH STAFF 
INTO THE CASH OFFICE 
THEY LEAVE WITH EIGHT THOUSAND WHEN THE 
POLICE REVIEWED THE VIDEO FOOTAGE 
THEY COUNT BELIEVE WHAT THEY WERE 
SAYING COULDN'T 
THE C. C. T. V. WAS 
SHOWN TO ONE OF THE OFFICER WHO WAS 
ON THE SQUAD IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND HE 
IDENTIFIED THE ROBBER AS BEING MR. 
MCDONALD WHICH IS MOST SURPRISING 
BECAUSE WE BELIEVED HE WAS IN 
PRISON SERVING FOR ROBBERIES ON THE 
RAILWAY AT THAT TIME 
IN FACT 
MCDONALD HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO 
FORD OPEN PRISON IN WEST SUSSEX HE 
HAD SIMPLY WALKED OUT PRISON 
OFFICERS SAY THE TRANSFER OF 
UNSUITABLE PRISONERS IS A GROWING 
TREND THAT IS PUTTING THE PUBLIC AT 
RISK 
THERE IS NO DOUBT FROM THE RISK INFORMATION I AM RECEIVED FROM MY 
MEMBERS THEY ARE GETTING THE WRONG 
PRISONERS THE WRONG INMATES THE 
WRONG OFFENDERS WHICH EVER 
EXPRESSION YOU WANT TO USE THAT 
HAS BEEN CAUSED BY THE OVERCROWDING 
SITUATION WE HAVE BOTH IN SCOTLAND 
AND IN ENGLAND AND WALES 
WITH A 
RECORD U. K. PRISON POPULATION OF MORE 
THAN NINETY THOUSAND HARRY FLETCHER OF THE 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PROBATION 
OFFICERS IS CONCERNED 
I HAVE BEEN 
WORRYED FOR FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS THAT 
INDIVIDUALS WERE BEING TRANSFERRED 
INTO OPEN JAILS IN ENGLAND AND 
WALES WHO DID POSE A RISG TO THE 
PUBLIC THE REASON I BELIEVE THAT 
IS BECAUSE MEMBERS OF MY 
ORGANISATION WORKS IN PRISONS AND 
THE COMMUNITY HAVE TOLD ME THAT THE 
IS THE CASE 
IN A STATEMENT JACK 
STRAW INSISTED THAT PUBLIC SAFETY 
WAS PARAMOUNT BUT THOSE AT THE 
COAL FACE REMAIN WORRIED THAT CASES 
LIKE THAT OF RICHARD MCDONALD WILL 
OCCUR AGAIN 
AND YOU CAN SEE MORE ON THAT 
INVESTIGATION IN PANORAMA PRISONS 
UNLOCKED THAT IS TONIGHT AT EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY 
ON B. B. C. ONE INTERNATIONAL AID IS 
BEGINNING TO REACH VICTIMS OF THE 
CYCLONE THAT HIT BURMA ON SATURDAY 
THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS SAYS IT

VILLAGES IN THE WORST HIT DELTA 
REASON HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

SPENT NINE DAYS IN INDIA SEARCHING 
FOR ANNES IT IS TWO MONTH SINCE 
HER DAUGTER EBODY WAS FOUND ON A 
BEACH IN GOA NOW BACK IN THE U. K. 
MRS. MCEWAN SAYS SHE BELIEVES SHE 
KNOWS THE NAME OF ONE OF THOSE WHO 
KILLED SCARLETT SHE SAYS SHE HE 
IS A POWERFUL PERSON WITH MONEY AND 
THAT IS WHY THE POLICE HAVE TRIED 
TO COVER IT UP SHE HAS GONE BAN TO 
INDIA TO RETRIEVE SCARLET'S ORGANS 
TAKEN DURING A POSTMORTEM 
EXAMINATION SHE HAS SAYS SHE HAS 
BEEN FORCED TO COME BACK WITHOUT 
THEM BUT WILL PERSIST UNTIL THEY 
ARE RETURNED 
I HAVE TO KEEP THE 
PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT TO DO 
SOMETHING L. WOULD LIKE JUSTICE FOR 
MISS DAUGHTER'S MURDER L. WOULD 
LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HER 
I WOULD LIKE THE ORGANS BACK AND 
MAKE SOME CHANGES SO OTHERS DON'T 
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS WITH THE 
FORENSICS AND MAYBE THE POLICE 
FORCE 
SO FAR TWO MEN HAVE BEEN FORCE ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF MURDERING 
SCARLETT MRS. MCEWAN SAYS SHE HAS 
PASSED WHAT INFORMATION SHE HAS ON 
TO THE INDIAN CENTRAL BUREAU OF 
INVESTIGATION WHO ARE DUE TO TAKE 
OVER THE CASE SHE HAS SAID SHE HAS 
HEARD NOTHING DIRECTLY ABOUT 
REPORTED PLANS FOR A BOLLYWOOD 
DIRECTOR TO MAKE A FILM 
BAD TEACHERS CAN MEAN THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PASS AND FAIL 
AT GCSE GCSE ACCORDING TO A REPORT 
PUBLISHED THIS MORNING RESEARCHERS 
AT THE IPPR THINK TANK FOUND THAT 
PUPILS WHO GET A C. GRADE WITH AN 
EXCELLENT TEACHER ARE ONLY LIKELY 
TO GET A D. WITH A BAD ONE 
NOW AUTHORITIES IN PORTUGAL WILL 
REEXAMINE THE CASE TODAY OF A 
BRITISH COUPLE WHO PASSED OUT DRUNK 
WHILE IN CHARGE OF THEIR THREE 
CHILDREN THE HOLIDAY MAKERS FROM 
NORTHERN IRELAND WERE ON A WEEK 
LONG TRIP TO THE ALGARVE WHEN 
SOCIAL SERVICES TOOK THE YOUNGSTERS 
INTO PROTECTIVE CUSTODY A LOCAL 
COURT RULED THAT THE CHILDREN 
SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THEIR PARENTS 
FORMER ENGLAND FOOTBALLER PAUL 
GASCOIGNE IS IN HOSPITAL FOLLOWING 
AN INCIDENT AT A LONDON HOTEL 
POLICE WERE CALLED TO HIS ROOM 
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AFTER REPORTS 
HE WAS BEHAVING ERATICALLY 
SCOTLAND YARD SAID NO CRIME HAD 
BEEN ALLEGED AND IT IS BELIEVED 
HE WENT FOR TREATMENT VOLUNTARILY 
PRINCE HARRY IS TO BE PRESENTED 
WITH A CAMPAIGN MEDAL FOR SERVICE 
IN AFGHANISTAN HE IS GOING TO BE 
MUNG ONE HUNDRED SIXTY HOUSEHOLD CAVALRY TROOPS 
WHO WILL BE HONOURED TODAY BY HIS 
AUNT THE PRINCESS ROYAL HIS 
REGIMENT WILL MARCH THROUGH THE 
STREETS OF WINDSOR AND ON TO A 
SERVICE OF REMEMBRANCE FOR THOSE 
WHO HAVE DIED IN MILITARY 
OPERATIONS COMING UP WE WILL FIND 
OUT WHY ONE CHILDREN'S CHARITY IS 
CALLING FOR A REVAMP OF SEX 
EDUCATION IN ENGLISH SCHOOLS 
FIRST OUR MAIN STORY THE B. B. C. HAS 
DISCOVERED THAT SINCE A CHANGE IN 
THE LAW TWO MONTHS AGO THERE HAS 
BEEN A BIG INCREASE IN THE NUMBER 
OF PLOYIERS BEING PROSECUTED FOR 
HIGHING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THE NEW 
REGIME IS PART OF A BIG SHAKE UP OF 
BRITAIN'S BORDER SECURITY SINCE IT 
CAME IN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN 
CAUGHT EMPLOYING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT 
AND THAT COMPARED TO ONLY SEVENTY ONE BOSSES 
BEING CAUGHT IN THE PAST TEN YEARS 
FOR EACH ILLEGAL WORKER A COMPANY 
CAN RECEIVE A TEN THOUSAND FINE JUST 
HELP US SEE THROUGH SOME OF THE 
ISSUES HERE DO YOU WELCOME THE 
CRACKDOWN 
YES I CO AS YOU HAVE CRACKDOWN HEARD FROM MANY YEARS PEOPLE HAVE 
SAID THE GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATEED TO 
PUT TEETH INTO THOSE LAW PRO 
PREVENTING ILLEGAL IMGRAX SO IT IS 
GOOD THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS 
STARTING TO GET TOUGH ON THOSE 
FEEM WHO ARE ILLEGALLY EMPLOYING 
PEOPLE 
SO 
YOU FIND THE PEOPLE AND PEOPLE YOU FIND THE EMPLOYER YOU SEND OUT 
A MESSAGE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM I I THINK THAT IS WHERE IT GETS 
DIFFICULT THERE ARE SO PEOPLE FROM 
KUNLYS LIKE ZIMBABWE OR IRAQ WHO 
CAN'T COUNTRIES LIKE ZIMBABWE OR 
IRAQ WHO CAN BE RETURNED THAT IS A 
PROBLEM THE OTHER CHALLENGE IN ALL 
OF THIS EVEN IF GOVERNMENT WERE 
ABLE TO FIND THE PEOPLE DETAIN 
THEM AND SEND THEM HOPE WE ARE 
TALKING YEARS AND MANY BILLIONS OF 
POUNDS AND MY FEAR IS THAT THAT 
WILL BE TOO LITTLE THE BRITISH 
PUBLIC WHO ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT 
QUESTION OF IMMIGRATION CAN'T WAIT 
THAT LONG TO SOLVE A PROBLEM LIKE 
THIS 
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY POSSIBLE THIS SOLUTIONS IT HAS TO BE A TWIN 
PRONGED ATTACK WE HAVE TO GET 
TOUGH BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE MIKE 
HAVE TO TAKE A RADICAL STEP LIKE 
SAYING TO THOSE EXPLOITED THEY CAN 
COME FORWARD AND HAVE THEIR STAY 
REGULAR RICED SO WE OFFER PEOPLE 
THE CHANCE CHANCE TO COME OUT OF 
THE SHADOWS RATHER THAN CONTINUE ON 
AS COSTLY INEFFECTIVE WAY OF 
FINDING THEM SO THIS IS AN AMNESTY 
FREE TO ALL 
NOT NECESSARILY L. 
THINK WE KNOW THERE ARE SEVERAL 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS PEOPLE LIVING 
WORKING ILLEGALLY WE ARE SAYING IF 
YOU CAN SHOW YOU HAVE A CLEAN 
CRIMINAL RECORD THAT YOU ARE 
PREPARED TO LIVE BY THE RULES 
LEARN ENGLISH THIS YOU SHOULD BE 
ALLOWED THE CHANCE TO STAY IT'S 
THE SORT OF MOST PRAL PRAGMATIC 
STEP THAT WE NEED TO CRACK A NUT 
LIKE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
ARE YOU 
RELATING THAT TO THE AMOUNT OF 
SOMETIME ONE SHAZ BEEN HERE NOT NOT NECESSARILY WE NEED A MECHANISM 
THAT CAN APPLY TO ANY OF THOSE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE WITHOUT 
PERMISSION POSSIBLY WORKING 
POSSIBLY BEING EBG EMPLOYEDED THAT THAT MIGHT BE AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO PEOPLE 
TO TRY IT 
IT MATE BE BUT WHAT WE 
HAVE SEEN TODAY IS A HOST OF 
REFORMS WHICH ARE ABOUT MAKING IT 
MUCH TOUGHER FOR PEOPLE TO COME TO 
THE U. K. THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF 
BORDERS ROLLING OUT IF THERE IS A 
BIG PULL EFFECT IT IS UNLIKELY 
PEOPLE WILL BE HERE IN LARGE 
NUMBERS WITHOUT PERMISSION 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS FOR

DESIGNS IN LONDON'S DOCKLANDS 
PLENTY OF INSPIRING IDEAS AT THE

WITH THE DETAILS 
SOME OF US ENJOYING A BEAUTIFUL DAY 
TODAY BUT THERE'S SOME RAIN AROUND 
THE FORECAST FOR THIS MORNING IS 
GENERALLY WARM ONE BEAUTIFUL 
SUNSHINE HERE IN LONDON 
THE REASON FOR THE RAIN IS ALL OF 
THIS CLOUD IT'S BEEN PROGRESSIVELY 
MOVING OFF INTO THE NORTH SEA 
THROUGH THE MORNING IT'S STILL 
AFFECTING PARTS OF ENGLAND AND 
WALES WALES THE SOUTH EAST PART OF THE COUNTRY 
WILL BE GENERALLY DRY WITH HIGH 
CLOUD CLOUD FROM THE MIDLANDS HEADING UP 
TOWARDS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND WE 
ARE LOOKING AT THE RAIN 
THE FAR NORTH OF ENGLAND ESCAPING 
IT AT THE MOMENT 
SOME SUNSHINE AROUND 
FOR SCOTLAND VARIABLE AMOUNTS OF 
CLOUD AND SUNSHINE SOME SEA MIST 
AND FOG LAPPING THE SHORES AT TIMES 
AS YOU WHIP INLAND IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
ACROSS THE IRISH SEA AROUND THE 
COAST OF WALES WE HAVE SEA MIST 
AND FOG BUT INLAND SOME SUNSHINE 
THROUGHOUT DAY THE RAIN BAND WILL 
PUSH OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF WALES 
AND THE SOUTH WEST 
IT'S PRECEDED BY SOME SHOWERS SOME 
OF THEM COULD BE HEAVY WITH RUMBLES 
OF THUNDER 
THROUGH THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT 
MUCH OF THE CLOUD WILL THIN AND 
BREAK STILL SOME REMNANTS ACROSS 
SCOTLAND PRODUCING THE ODD SHOWER 
BUT TOMORROW MORNING IT'S LOOKING 
GLORIOUS GLORIOUS TEMPERATURES OF TWENTY TWO DEGREES CELSIUS 
THAT'S SEVENTY TWO FAHRENHEIT 
AS WE HEAD IN THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
ANOTHER GORGEOUS DAY IN PROSPECT 
A LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD AROUND 
PRODUCING THE ODD SHOWER JUST HERE 
AND THERE BUT TEMPERATURES STILL 
HEALTHY FOR THE TIME OF THE YEAR 
SIXTEEN CELSIUS IN MANCHESTER THAT'S SIXTY ONE 
FAHRENHEIT THE OUTLOOK FOR FRIDAY 
LOOKS FINE AND DRY 
DOZENS OF WATERMILLS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY ARE LITERALLY ROTTING AWAY 
BECAUSE OF DESPERATE SHORTAGE OF 
EXPERTS TO MAINTAIN THEM 
SURPRISINGLY THE SAILS ARE STILL 
TURNING ON FIVE HUNDRED WATERMILLS 
SOME ARE PRODUCING FLOUR BUT FOR 
HOW LONG WE HAVE BEEN TO MEET SOME 
TRAINEE MILLWRIGHTS WHO ARE 
LEARNING THE SKILLS 
HOW ARE YOU WITH HEIGHTS 
PAUL HERE IS A RARITY A TRAINEE 
MILLWRIGHT 
A VERY MIXED REACTION SYSTEM ONE OF 
MY FRIENDS THOUGHT I WAS GOING BE 
WORKING ON A MILLING MACHINE FOR A 
LONG TIME THEY THINK I'M CRAZY 
TODAY THEY'RE AT THE FERN DRAINAGE 
MILL IN NORFOLK THESE BUILDINGS 
ARE ICONIC IN THIS PART OF THE 
WORLD YET THERE IS A FIVE YEAR 
WAITING THROIST DO THEM UP BECAUSE 
THERE ARE JUST HANDFUL OF 
MILLWRIGHTS PAUL'S TRAINING HAS 
BEEN PAID FOR BY LOTTERY CASH 
OTHERS ARE SPONSORED BY THE SOCIETY 
FOR THE PROTECTION OF ANCIENT 
BUILDINGS BUT IT'S STILL A DYING 
SKILL SKILL I WANT TO 
LEARN SO MUCH L. WANT TO LEARN ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT WHEN 
YOU SEE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
WORKING AT IT ALL OF THEIR LIVES 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO DIE NOBODY 
WILL TAKE IT ON IT'S SAD 
VINCENT'S BEEN DOING THIS JOB SINCE 
THE SEVENTIES SIXTY FOUR NOW HE'S LOOKING 
TO WIND THINGS DOWN A BIT YET HE 
HAS JOBS ON ALL OVER THE WORLD 
NORFOLK JERUSALEM AND HERE IN 
UPMINSTER IN ESSEX 
WORKING ON 
MILLS IS YOUNG PEOPLE'S WORK IT'S 
VERY ENERGETIC AND YOU NEED TO BE 
STRONG AND FIT WE ARE GETTING A 
BIT PAST IT NOW 
IS THERE REALLY A FUTURE IN IT 
VINCENT THINKS SO 
JUDGING BY THE 
PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN 
WORKING I'VE NEVER BEEN SHORT OF 
WORK I THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE 
IT IS A SPECIALIST JOB YOU NEED 
SPECIALISTS TO DO IT WHO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
THE EMOTIONAL AND SEXUAL ASPECTS OF 
RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD BE MADE A 
COMPULSORY PART OF SEX EDUCATION IN 
SCHOOLS ACCORDING TO THE 
CHILDREN'S CHARITY CHILDLINE AS 
THE LAW STANDS SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND 
ONLY HAVE TO TEACH THE BIOLOGICAL 
ASPECTS OF SEX BUT CHILDLINE SAYS 
TOO MANY CHILDREN ARE GETTING 
CAUGHT IN INTIMATE SITUATIONS THEY 
CAN'T DEAL WITH NATALIE CRONIN IS 
FROM THE NSPCC 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN 
YOU ARE CALLING FOR WHAT 
SPECIFICALLY SPECIFICALLY WE ARE VERY AWARE THAT LOT OF 
CHILDREN ARE RINGING CHILDLINE AND 
THEY'RE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT BEING 
IN THESE DIFFICULT SITUATIONS THEY 
DON'T FEEL EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH 
THEM THEY DON'T HAVE EVEN HAVE 
BASIC EDUCATION ON THE FACTS THEY 
NEED NEED WE ARE SAYING AS THE GOVERNMENT IS 
LOOKING AT HOW SEX EDUCATION IS 
TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS THIS IS GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY 
CHILD GETS THAT INFORMATION 
WHAT IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME ABOUT 
WHAT YOU ARE CALLING FOR IT'S NOT 
THE BIOLRBLGS THE STANDARD SEX 
EDUCATION YOU WANT THE EMOTIONAL 
SIDE OF IT THE PEER PRESSURE 
ETHICALLY WOULDN'T THERE BE 
PROBLEMS WITH HOW THAT IS TAUGHT 
WE ARE SAYING THAT THE TEACHERS WHO 
PROVIDE THAT EDUCATION NEED TO GET 
SPECIALIST TRAINING THAT'S REALLY 
IMPORTANT BECAUSE SEX IS SO MUCH 
MORE THAN THAT JUST A BIOLOGICAL 
THING AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S ABOUT 
UNDERSTANDING THE EMOTIONS THAT GO 
WITH THAT AND FOR CHILDREN AND 
YOUNG PEOPLE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE 
PEER PRESSURE IF YOU UNPACK THAT 
IN THE CONTEXT OF CLASSROOM IT'S 
MUCH EASIER TO NAVIGATE THOSE VERY 
DIFFICULT SITUATIONS 
SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY THIS IS OUT 
OF THE REMIT OF SCHOOLS THIS IS 
SURELY SOMETHING PARENT DEALS 
WITH IT'S SUCH SENSITIVE ISSUE 
AND THAT RELATIONSHIP TOO BETWEEN 
PARENTS AND CHILDREN SHOULD BE 
WHERE THE FOCUS SHOULD BE 
YES PARENTS HAVE VERY IMPORTANT 
ROLE TO PLAY IN TALKING TO CHILDREN 
ABOUT SEX AND HOW TO DEAL WITH 
THEIR SITUATIONS AND MANY DO BUT 
WE ARE STILL GETTING A LOT OF CALLS 
FROM CHILDREN WHO DON'T HAVE THAT 
BASIC INFORMATION THEY DON'T 
UNDERSTAND HOW TO SAY NO WHEN 
THEY'RE IN DIFFICULT SITUATION 
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO KEEP SAFE 
IF IT HAPPENS IN SCHOOLS IT MEANS 
THAT EVERY CHILD GETS THAT 
OPPORTUNITY WE KNOW FROM SOME OF 
OUR CALLS THAT SOME CHILDREN FIND 
IT DIFFICULT TO TALK TO THEIR 
PARENTS WHEN THEY'RE IN THESE 
SITUATIONS WE'VE BEEN DOING WORK 
IN NORFOLK WHERE WE ARE DOING A 
CAMPAIGN CALLED LET'S TALK ABOUT 
SEX SEX A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD HAS TOLD CHILDLINE 
THAT HE HAD UNPROTECTED SEX WITH A 
GIRL FOR A DARE A YOUNG GIRL WAS 
WORRIED SHE WAS PREGNANT BECAUSE 
SHE DARE NOT SAY NO TO HER 
BOYFRIEND IN CASE HE DUMPED HER IF 
THOSE CASES WERE IN A SCHOOL AND 
YOU HAD THAT EMOTIONAL GUIDELINE 
WHERE TEACHERS CAN TALK ABOUT THESE 
CASES WOULD IT STAY IN THE 
CLASSROOM OR DO THEY INVOLVE 
PARENTS AT THAT POINT WHAT ARE YOU 
SUGGESTING 
WE ARE SUGGESTING THAT SUGGESTING BEFORE CHILDREN GET CAUGHT UP IN 
THESE SITUATIONS THEY HAVE A 
PROPER DISCUSSION IN THE CLASSROOM 
WHERE THEY CAN REALLY THINK THROUGH 
FOR THEMSELVES HOW THEY WOULD DEAL 
WITH PEER PRESSURE HOW THEY WOULD 
DEAL WITH THE RISKS INVOLVED WHAT 
THEY WOULD DO IN A GIVEN SITUATION 
SO WHEN THEY COME TO THAT SITUATION 
THEY CAN KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE THEY 
CAN MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE 
RESPONSIBLE AND THAT ARE RIGHT FOR 
THEM 
AT WHAT AGE SHOULD THAT START THEM DEALING WITH PEER PRESSURE 
LEARNING HOW TO SAY NO IN DIFFICULT 
SITUATIONS AT WHAT AGE SHOULD THAT 
CONVERSATION IN A CLASSROOM START 
ACCORDING TO YOU 
IT SHOULD START 
ALL OF THE WAY THROUGH FOR A CHILD 
TO KNOW HOW TO KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE 
THEY NEED TO LEARN THAT REALLY 
EARLY ON 
FROM ELEVEN OR TWELVE OR 
EARLIER YEAH EARLIER YEAH THANK EARLIER YEAH EARLIER YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH NATALIE 
DECLAN IS IN FRANCE

GREAT IDEA U. HOW AFFORDABLE IS 
DESIGN AT THE MOMENT AND CAN PEOPLE 
AFFORD IT IN 
I THINK I THINK 
ABOUT DESIGN IT IS NOT SHOPPING 
DESIGN IS IDEAS WE HAD THE GRAND 
DESIGNED LIVE LAST NIGHT THE 
PROGRAMME ONE OF THE HOUSES U. WAS 
DESIGNED BY AN ARCHITECT WHO HAD 
ALMOST NO MONEY AND HE PRODUCED 
AMAZING KITCHENS THAT HE DESIGNED 
HIMSELF I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO 
SEPARATE OUT THE FACT THAT SHOPPING 
AND CONSUMERISM IS ONE THING AND 
YOU KNOW GOOD IDEAS ARE ANOTHER 
GOOD IDEAS COST NOTHING IN A WAY 
AND THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
A GOOD IDEA AND BAD ONE IN TERMS OF 
COST IT IS MAKING SURE YOU PLUG 
INTO WHAT IS GOOD DESIGN WHAT ARE 
THE EFFECT OF YOUR PROGRAMME YOU 
ARE SAYING PEOPLE YOU ARE WORRIED 
PEOPLE WILL BUILD WHITE BOX HOUSES 
YOU SEE THERE AREN'T ANY HERE MY 
OWN HOUSE IS ANYTHING BUT A WHITE 
BOX THIS IS IT THIS IS OUR MODEL

YOU ARE DESIGNING YOUR OWN HOUSE I I HAVEN'T BIT IT YET YOU SKI IT IF 
I WORK BACKWARD THESE ARE TILES WE 
HAVE USE ADD LOT OF FOOD TO BUILD 
IT THE ROOF DOESN'T DO THAT IN 
REAL LIFE IT IS PRE PREFAB KATEED 
THESE ARE ALL WOODEN PREFAB KATEED 
SECTIONS THAT COME TOGETHER WHAT 
WE ARE BUILDING THE THE GROUND 
FLOOR THE BREAKFAST CEREAL IN 
THERE THAT REPRESENTS THE STRAW 
THIS IS PREFAB KATEED THAT GOES UP

HOUSING CRISIS AND THE CURRENT 
CREDIT CRUNCH BUT FOR NOW BACK TO

HEADLINES FOR YOU THIS MORNING A 
BILL RETURNING TO BILLIONS THE 
RISING COST OF SENDERS WORKERS HOME

ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS PRISON 
OFFICERS SAY POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS 
CRIMINALS ARE BEING SENT TO OPEN 
JAILS IN ORDER TO EASE OVERCROWDING 
COMING UP HERE ON BREAKFAST THE THE TAIL OF THE KING THE COOK HIS 
KITCHEN AND HIS COOK BOOK 
STANDING THE TASTE OF TIME YES 
CHEF CLARISSA DIXON WRIGHT WILL BE 
HERE TO TELL US HOW SHE HAS BEEN 
GETTING ON WITH RECIPES CREATED SEVEN HUNDRED 
YEARS AGO 
NOW IF YOU HAVE GONE ON TRIP TO 
FRANCE TO LITTLE CAMPSITE YOU 
THINK GET AWAY FROM IT ALL BUT 
DECLAN HAS GONE THERE TOO HOW ARE 
YOU DECLAN NOBODY IS GETTING AWAY 
FROM ANYTHING LOOK AT THESE KIDS 
THEY IN FRENZY OF CONNECT FOUR 
THE RESPONSIBLE ADULTS ARE OVER 
THERE THE IRRESPONSIBLE ADULT HAS 
BEEN GIVEN THIS WRETCHED THING TO 
CONTROL AND AIM NOT SURE IF I AM 
GETTING THIS RIGHT OR NOT WE SEEM 
TO BE GOING BACKWARDS AND A BIT 
FORWARD THERE WE GO THE REASON WE 
ARE IN BACKWARDS BACKWARDS STOP 
THE REASON WE ARE IN FRANCE AT 
THIS CAMPSITE IS WE ARE LOOKING AT 
THE VALUE OF THE EURO WHICH REACHED 
A HIGH AGAINST THE POUND LAST MONTH 
I MEANS FOR ALL THESE FAMILIES HERE 
ALONG THE SIDE OF THE LAKE HERE 
THIS HOLIDAY HAS BECOME THAT LITTLE 
BIT MORE EXPENSIVE AND IT'S THE 
SAME STORY TALL WAY ACROSS EUROPE 
SO TO LOOK AT HOW PRICES HAVE CAKED 
IN YOUR WE SENT BRIAN OFF ON A 
LITTLE TOUR IT'S THE MOST FAMOUS 
ANTIQUITY IN THE WORLD BUT ARE THE 
PRICES MONUMENTAL LAST YEAR IT 
WOULD HAVE COST YOU SEVEN POINT NINE TWO TO GO UP 
THERE THIS YEAR IT IS NINE POINT THREE SIX 
AND ALL BECAUSE OF THE STRONGER 
EURO 
HOW ABOUT THE TOWER OF PISIA LAST 
YEAR IT INCLINED TOWARDS THE 
AFFORDABLE AT NINE POINT NINE OH PERSON THIS 
YEAR THE TILT IS RATHER MORE 
EXTREME AT ELEVEN POINT SEVEN OH BUT IF THAT IS 
THE COST OF EXPERIENCES AN OVERHANG 
HOW ABOUT A HANGOVER 
LUCKILY THE PRICE OF BEER IN 
SPAIN IS STILL PRETTY LOW LAST 
YEAR AROUND SIXTY SIX P. THIS YEAR SEVENTY EIGHT P. 
AFTER FEW OF THEM YOU WON'T 
NOTICE THAT SORT OF DIFFERENCE 
WHERE CAN YOU GO WHERE YOUR POUND 
IS STILL SOUND 
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THE EURO ZONE 
TURKEY IS GOOD VALUE BUT THE HIGH 
PRICE OF OIL MEANS IT'S MORE 
EXPENSIVE TO GET THERE BULGARIA IS 
LOOKING CHEAP AS IS CROATIA FOR 
THE LOWEST PRICES IN EUROPE THAT I 
HAVE FOUND YOU HAVE TO HEAD ACROSS 
THE BORDER INTO SERBIA TREMENDOUS 
VALUE THEY WON'T LAUGH AT YOUR 
POUND POUND FOR EXAMPLE THE PRICE OF A COFFEE 
IN SERBIA CAN BE AS LOW AS FIFTY P. OR 
STAYING OVERNIGHT IN A HOSTEL IN 
THE MIDDLE OF BELGRADE CAN COST YOU 
JUST SEVEN THAT'S INCLUDING BREAKFAST 
BACK IN THE EURO ZONE REMEMBER 
THERE HAS BEEN INFLATION TOO SO 
LAST YEAR A RIDE IN THE LIFT UP 
THE EIFFEL TOWER WOULD HAVE COST 
YOU SEVEN POINT FIVE NINE BUT THIS YEAR IT'S GONE 
SKY HIGH AT NINE POINT THREE SIX THIS SUMMER YOU 
CAN SPOT THE BRITISH THEY'RE THE 
ONES TAKING THE STAIRS 
O. K. FINISHED NOW 
THANK YOU BRIAN

WELCOME ON B. B. C. BREAKFAST WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT THE RISE IN THE VALUE 
OF THE EURO HAVE YOU NOTICED IT IN 
YOUR HOLIDAY PLANS THIS YEAR WE WE TRY NOT TO LET IT BOTHER US SO MUCH 
BECAUSE WE LOVE FRANCE AND LOVE 
THIS CAMP SITE WE WOULD DO IT 
REGARDLESS OF THE EXCHANGE RATE 
ALTHOUGH IT HAS TO BE SAID WE DID 
HAVE TO FACTOR IT IN WHEN WE WERE 
COSTING IT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE COME 
AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR 
DOES THE 
CAMP SITE MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE 
WAS THAT IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND 
WHEN YOU CAME UP WITH THE HOLIDAY 
PLANS 
IN A WAY YES BUT REALLY PLANS THE CAMPING HOLIDAY WAS ACTUALLY 
BECAUSE OF THE STYLE OF HOLIDAY IT 
IS RATHER THAN THE FACT IT WAS 
THAT LITTLE BIT LESS EXPENSIVE FOR FOR THE PLAYING OUTDOORS ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY BEN IS DETERMINED TO GRAB HOLD OF 
THIS MICROPHONE 
ABSOLUTELY HE'S 
DETERMINED TO GRAB HOLD EVERYTHING 
HE'S AT THAT AGE YOU ARE IN 
BUSINESS AS WELL SO IT'S NOT JUST 
HOLIDAYS WHERE YOU NOTICE IT YOU 
NOTICE IT IN YOUR BUSINESS HOW 
DOES IT AFFECT YOU 
WE IMPORT 
ITALIAN AUDIO EQUIPMENT INTO THE U. K. 
OUR RETAIL PRICES WORKED OUT AT AN 
EXCHANGE RATE LOWER THERE IS A 
DIFFERENCE IN THE PERCENTAGE TO 
YOUR PROFIT MARGINS 
YOU TAKE THE 
HIT IN YOUR PROFITABILITY 
YES WE 
HAVE TO PUT OUR PRICES UP TO 
COMPENSATE OTHERWISE YOUR PROFIT 
MARGIN GOES YOU HAVE TO BALANCE

THE U. K. FOR IMPORTING EUROPEAN GOODS 
THE IMPACT ON YOU YOU STILL COME 
ON HOLIDAY YES

WE MIGHT NEED TO GET SOME HELP YES URGENT HELP REQUIRED FOR THE GIRLS' 
TEAM MORE FROM HERE ON THE NEWS 
CHANNEL CHANNEL WE MISSED THE SHOT OF YOU JUMPING 
FROM YOUR PEDALO ON TO THE LAND WE 
WANTED TO SEE THAT 
IT PAINS ME 
GREATLY CHARLIE TO SAY THAT THE 
PEDALO HAS GONE 
SHAME SHAME IT'S A FAR CRY FROM MICROWAVE MEALS 
AND CALORIE COUNTING DIETS THE 
EARLIEST KNOWN COOKBOOK WAS 
MEDIEVAL SCROLL CREATED SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS 
AGO AGO WOULD THOSE RECIPES WHET OUR 
APPETITE TODAY ONE LADY ON 
MISSION TO FIND OUT IS CLARISSA 
DICKSON WRIGHT 
WE WILL SPEAK TO HER IN JUST 
MOMENT FIRST LET'S HAVE A TASTE 
OF WHAT SHE HAS IN STORE FOR US 
MEDIEVAL ENGLAND IN THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETIES 
RICHARD THE SECOND IS ON THE THRONE HE 
REINS AS DIVINE MONARCH AND THE 
CHURCH DICTATES THE DAILY RITUAL OF 
LIFE BUT ONE CORNER OF THIS 
BEAUTIFUL WORLD CLAMMERS WITH NOISE 
DAY IN DAY OUT 
IT'S THE KITCHENS OF RICHARD'S 
COURT I'M THRILLED TO TELL YOU 
THAT THE RECIPES COOKED BY THE 
KING'S MASTERS CHEFS WERE RECORDED 
AND COMPILED INTO ENGLAND'S OLDEST 
KNOWN COOKBOOK THE FORM OF CURRY 
I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT I HAVE NEVER 
COOKED FROM IT UNTIL NOW BUT 
THERE IS A FIRST TIME FOR 
EVERYTHING IT'S A FORGOTTEN 
CHAPTER IN OUR CULINARY HISTORY AND 
I'M CONVINCED THAT RICHARD'S 
COOKBOOK WILL REVEAL THAT MANY OF 
THE DISHES WE EAT TODAY CAN BE 
TRACED BACK TO HIS KITCHEN 
I'LL FIND OUT IF OTHERS AGREE WHEN 
I FEED SOME MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFFS 
LATER LATER BUT FIRST THE TALE OF THE KING 
THE COOK HIS KITCHEN AND HIS 
COOKBOOK COOKBOOK CLARISSA DICKSON WRIGHT IS HERE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN 
THAT IS FASCINATING YOU HAVE 
HISTORY AND COOKING ALL MIX THE UP 
TOGETHER IT MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT 
JOURNEY FOR YOU 
IT WAS WONDERFUL 
GAINSBOROUGH HALL IS SOMEWHERE I 
HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO COOK IN 
THEIR MEDIEVAL KITCHENS WHAT WAS 
FASCINATING WAS OUR RECOGNISABLE 
THE RECIPES ARE TO US NOT SOME OF 
THEM YOU HAVE PORPOISE AND 
FUMMETRY 
WHAT ARE THEY 
PURR POISE FUMMETRY IS AN ANIMAL FUMMETRY IS CRACKED 
PORRIDGE WITH WHEAT WE DIDN'T DO 
THAT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THE FINAL 
RECIPE WHICH WAS PEARS IN RED WINE 
YOU GET THAT IN EVERY RESTAURANT 
THESE DAYS WAS CONSIDERABLY NICER 
THAT THE PEARS IN RED WINE YOU GET 
IN EVERY RESTAURANT 
ON THE FACE OF 
IT IF YOU ASKED ME WHAT MEDIEVAL 
PEOPLE EAT I WOULD HAVE A MENTAL 
IMAGE OF ROAST BOAR ON A SPIT AND 
BREAD AND CIDER OR MEAD BUT 
CLEARLY IT WAS MUCH MORE 
SOPHISTICATED THAN THAT 
YOU SEE 
ONCE YOU HAD THE FIRST CRUSADE AND 
PEOPLE WENT OUT AND THEY FOUND ALL 
OF THE SPICES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
THEN ALL OF THE COOKS THE CHEFS OF 
THE DAY WANTED ALL OF THESE SPICES 
BUT ALSO THERE'S THIS MYTH THAT 
HISTORY WAS THAT PEOPLE IN ANCIENT 
HISTORY OR OLD HISTORY ATE RUBBISH 
WHY WOULD THEY THEY HAD BEAUTIFUL 
BUILDINGS AND ARTEFACTS THEY ATE 
BETTER THAN WE EAT TODAY WHAT WHAT ABOUT RECREATING THESE RECIPES IN 
TERMS OF GETTING INCREDIENTS AND 
THE CONDITIONS HOW WAS THAT THE THE SWEET AND SOUR FISH DISH WE DID 
WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLY NICER THAN 
THE ONE THAT SOME CHEF DID IN THE 
TIMES LAST NIGHT WAS MADE PARTLY 
WITH FRESH WATER FISH AND WITH SOLE 
THEY ATE A LOT OF FRESH WATER FISH 
WE HAD PIKE AND ROACH L. HAD NEVER 
EATEN ROACH IT WAS RATHER GOOD 
YOU SOUND SURPRISED 
I WAS YOU 
KNOW YOU ALWAYS THINK IT AS A 
RATHER MUDDY THING YOU GIVE TO THE 
CAT AND THEN THE VARIOUS SPICES IN 
IT IT TURNED OUT THAT YOU MIGHT 
FIND IT IN SOME SPANISH MARKET TOWN 
TODAY 
WITHOUT WISHING TO PRE EMPT TODAY THE PROGRAMME TOO MUCH THE PEOPLE 
YOU SERVED IT TO HOW DID IT GO 
DOWN 
SURPRISINGLY WELL CHRIS DOWN WARBOY IS NOT A FOOD HISTORIAN 
HE'S A MEDIEVAL A. R. KIFFIST AND HE 
WAS REALLY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED 
MICHELLE HAD A BETTER IDEA L. 
IMAGINE KATE DID AS WELL THE 
REALLY INTERESTING ONE WAS CLAIRE 
BRAY WHO IS THE A. R. KIFFIST AT THE 
BRITISH LIBRARY WHO WE INVITED WHEN 
WE SAW THE BOOK HER REACTION TO IT 
WAS FASCINATING SHE REALLY HAD NO 
BELIEF THAT IT MIGHT BE EDIBLE WE WE WILL SEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
