THIS GIANT OTTER LIVES ON A LAKE IN THE PERUVIAN AMAZON 
SHE SHARES HER DEN WITH HER MATE AND THEIR YOUNG FROM THE LAST TWO YEARS 
THEY'RE A CLOSE KNIT FAMILY GROUP 
AND TOGETHER THEY MAKE A FORMIDABLE TEAM 
MEASURED NOSE TO TAIL 
THERE ARE OVER TEN METRES OF GIANT OTTER IN THIS BANK SIDE HOLE 
EACH ANIMAL WEIGHS ALMOST AS MUCH AS AN ALSATIAN 
GIANT OTTERS ARE THE MOST SOCIAL OF ALL OTTERS 
AND WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH THESE STRONG FAMILY BONDS BECOME CRUCIAL 
AT FIRST THEY MAY LOOK ALIKE BUT EACH HAS A MARKING ON ITS THROAT 
AS INDIVIDUAL AS A HUMAN FINGERPRINT 
THE ADULT FEMALE HAS ANOTHER DISTINGUISHING MARK A PINK EAR 
WHICH MAKES HER EASY TO IDENTIFY IN AND OUT OF THE WATER 
WITH THE SUPPORT OF HER MATE SHE TAKES THE LEADING ROLE IN THIS GROUP 
THE OTTERS REMAIN HIGHLY VISIBLE THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
BUT THEY SHARE THIS LAKE WITH ANOTHER PREDATOR 
THAT KEEPS A MUCH LOWER PROFILE 
THE SOLITARY BLACK CAIMAN 
THERE ARE NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED OF THEM HERE LURKING IN THE BANK SIDE VEGETATION 
THE LARGEST CAN DWARF EVEN A GIANT OTTER 
THE BLACK CAIMAN AND THE GIANT OTTERS ARE RARE IN THE AMAZON'S TRIBUTARIES 
THEIR PREFERRED HABITATS ARE OXBOW LAKES STRETCHES OF THE RIVER 
THAT HAVE BEEN CUT OFF FROM THE MAIN FLOW AS IT MEANDERS ALONG ITS COURSE 
IN THE ABSENCE OF A CURRENT LEAVES SEEDS AND FRUIT 
FALLING INTO THE WATER FROM OVERHANGING VEGETATION SETTLE 
TURNING THESE LAKES INTO NUTRIENT TRAPS 
WHICH SUPPORT ABUNDANT QUANTITIES OF FISH 
AND IT'S THE FISH THAT ATTRACT THE OTTERS 
NOT THAT THE FISH ARE EASY TO SEE IN THE DEBRIS LADEN WATER 
AND DOWN HERE THERE IS ALWAYS THE RISK OF BUMPING INTO TROUBLE 
IN THE MURK 
THE OTTERS DETECT THE MOVEMENTS OF FISH WITH THEIR SENSITIVE WHISKERS 
DRIVEN BY LARGE WEBBED FEET AND POWERFUL FLAT TAILS MORE LIKE BEAVERS' THAN THOSE OF OTTERS 
IN SLOW MOTION THEIR MOVEMENT LOOKS ALMOST EFFORTLESS 
BUT WATCH THEM CATCH FISH IN REAL TIME 
AND THEIR SHEER SPEED AND AGILITY BECOMES APPARENT 
FISHING AT THIS SPEED HOWEVER BURNS A LOT OF CALORIES 
TO SUPPORT THEIR HIGH OCTANE LIFESTYLE 
EACH OTTER NEEDS TO EAT A MASSIVE FOUR KILOS OF FISH A DAY 
OVER EIGHT TIMES THE CALORIES A MAN NEEDS 
FORTUNATELY FISH ARE PLENTIFUL HERE 
INDEED THIS RELIABLE SOURCE OF FOOD IS ONE OF THE REASONS 
WHY THIS KIND OF OTTER HAS BEEN ABLE TO GROW SO BIG 
THE YOUNGEST IN THE GROUP MAY NOT MANAGE TO CATCH AS MUCH AS THEY NEED 
SO UNTIL THEY ARE PROFICIENT HUNTERS THE ADULTS HELP WITH THE ODD HANDOUT 
TOGETHER THE FAMILY EATS AROUND TWENTY FIVE KILOS OF FISH A DAY 
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE FISH ALL TO THEMSELVES 
CAIMAN ARE ALSO FISH EATERS THOUGH A LARGE CAIMAN LIKE THIS 
WOULD SNAP UP A CARELESS YOUNG OTTER IF THE OPPORTUNITY AROSE 
AFTER A LONG MORNING GORGING ON FISH 
THE OTTERS LED BY THE ADULT FEMALE PINK EAR 
HAUL OUT ON TO A TRUNK TO SUNBATHE RELAX AND DIGEST ALL THAT FISH 
LIKE SO MUCH OF GIANT OTTER LIFE THIS IS DONE AS A GROUP 
THOUGH AFTER ALL THAT ACTIVITY 
IT TAKES A WHILE TO COMPLETELY SWITCH OFF AND SETTLE DOWN 
SOME TURTLES HAVE EMERGED TO SUNBATHE TOO 
BUT THEY'VE ATTRACTED UNWANTED ATTENTION 
BUTTERFLIES GATHER TO TRY AND COLLECT SALTY TEARS FROM THE TURTLES' EYES 
AND THE TURTLES' LEG WAVING SEEMS FUTILE 
THE OTTERS' EYES TEMPT BUTTERFLIES 
BUT IT'S MUCH HARDER TO HIT A MOVING TARGET 
THE OTTERS SEEM TO FIND THE THOUGHT OF A PROBING PROBOSCIS IN THE EYE 
AS APPEALING AS WE WOULD 
THE OTTERS SPEND MOST OF THEIR DAY IN THE WATER 
SO DO THE CAIMAN 
ONCE SPOTTED THE FAMILY CAN STEER CLEAR OF THE LARGE CAIMAN 
BUT THIS GIVE WAY RULE ISN'T ALL SO ONE SIDED 
SOME CAIMAN HAVE LEARNT THAT IT CAN BE WISE TO RETREAT 
FROM THE APPROACHING OTTERS 
WHEN FISHING GIANT OTTERS HUNT IN PACKS 
WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE KNOWN LOCALLY AS WOLVES OF THE RIVER 
BY WORKING AS A TEAM THEY CAN CONFUSE AND EXHAUST FISH 
MAKING THEM EASIER TO CATCH 
HUNTING TOGETHER LIKE THIS 
MAY HELP EACH MEMBER OF THE GROUP TO CATCH ITS OWN FISH 
WHEN A FISH IS THERE TO BE EATEN NOTHING ELSE SEEMS TO MATTER 
NOT EVEN ONE OF YOUR SCREAMING OFFSPRING 
THOUGH THIS TIME PINK EAR RELENTS AND LETS THE YOUNGSTER HAVE A PIECE 
YOUNG OTTERS BEG WHEN THEY'RE HUNGRY WHICH IS MOST OF THE TIME 
BUT THEY ARE MUCH MORE INSISTENT WHEN AN ADULT HAS CAUGHT A BIG FISH 
AFTER ALL THIS ONE LOOKS BIG ENOUGH TO SHARE 
BUT IT'S NOT A BEGGING YOUNGSTER THAT'S BOTHERING THE FEEDING OTTERS 
IT'S THOSE BUTTERFLIES AGAIN 
BUTTERFLIES HERE ARE QUICK TO COLLECT ANY NUTRIENTS THEY CAN 
SO WHERE THERE ARE LOTS OF NUTRIENTS THERE ARE LOTS OF BUTTERFLIES 
BACK AT THE DEN SITE THE OTTERS' LATRINE IS A BUTTERFLY HEAVEN 
THE OTTERS USE THIS LATRINE THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
BUT IT'S MORE THAN JUST A CONVENIENCE 
FISH RICH FAECES MAY BE NECTAR TO A BUTTERFLY 
BUT THIS COLLECTIVE AND SMELLY PILE 
IS ALSO A PUNGENT WARNING TO OTHER PASSING OTTERS 
THAT THIS TERRITORY IS TAKEN 
THEY MIX THEIR DUNG WITH THE MUD IN FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE 
AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY TAKE PART IN THIS RITUAL 
THE DOWN SIDE IS THAT THE SMELL COULD ALSO ATTRACT SOME UNWANTED VISITORS 
BUT THEN THE CAIMAN ARE NEVER VERY FAR OFF ANYWAY 
A YOUNGSTER ON ITS WAY BACK TO THE DEN SPOTS THE LURKING CAIMAN 
BUT THIS CAIMAN SITS TIGHT 
IT HAS LITTLE TO FEAR FROM A SOLITARY AND INEXPERIENCED OTTER 
THE YOUNGSTER WON'T HANG AROUND 
IT'S ON DANGEROUS GROUND WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF OTHERS IN THE GROUP WHO ARE STILL BACK AT THE DEN 
GIANT OTTERS ARE STRICTLY DAYTIME ANIMALS 
AND THEY USE THE REMAINING HOURS OF SUN FOR A FINAL FISHING EXPEDITION 
THOUGH THEY MAY START WITH SOMETHING ON A SMALLER SCALE 
TYPICAL FOREST PREDATORS ARE SMALL SOLITARY AND NOCTURNAL 
BUT AS THESE OTTERS EVOLVED THEY BECAME BIGGER AND MORE SOCIAL 
AND SO MORE SECURE AND BETTER ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DAYLIGHT 
TO CATCH THEIR PREY 
THE CAIMAN REMAINED NOCTURNAL 
AND LATE IN THE AFTERNOON IT'S NOW THAT THEY BECOME MORE ACTIVE 
BOTH MAY HAVE CAUSE TO FEAR EACH OTHER 
BUT THIS SHIFT SYSTEM LESSENS THE RISK OF POTENTIAL CONFLICT 
CAIMAN HUNTING ALONE USUALLY AMBUSH THEIR PREY 
BUT ON RARE OCCASIONS EVEN THESE LONERS SEEM TO WORK TOGETHER 
HERDING FISH INTO THE SHALLOWS 
HERE THE FRIGHTENED FISH FORM CONCENTRATED SHOALS 
ALL THAT'S NEEDED NOW IS A RANDOM LUNGE 
THE NIGHT SHIFT DRAWS TO A CLOSE 
BUT THE OTTER FAMILY IS ALREADY OUT OF ITS DEN 
A LARGE AND STILL ACTIVE CAIMAN 
IS SPOTTED BY PINK EAR 
THE OTTERS SOUND AN ALARM 
AND CLUMP TOGETHER FOR ADDED SECURITY 
THIS IS WHEN BEING PART OF A GROUP BRINGS ITS REWARDS 
BUT NOW IT'S NOT THE CAIMAN THAT IS THE THREAT IT'S THE OTTERS 
THE LONE CAIMAN BECOMES THE TARGET 
PINK EAR LEADS THE UNPROVOKED ATTACK 
AND WITH HER FAMILY AROUND HER THE OTTERS DISPLAY THEIR STRENGTH 
AN INDIVIDUAL OTTER WOULD NEVER HAVE DARED TO TRY THIS 
SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES EVEN THE HEAVILY ARMOURED CAIMAN 
IS PUSHED ONTO THE DEFENSIVE 
BUT ITS JAWS AND TAIL COULD STILL INFLICT A FATAL WOUND 
SO WHY DO THE OTTERS RISK IT 
ATTACKS LIKE THIS MIGHT BE SEEN AS A WAY OF ASSERTING THEIR POSITION ON THE LAKE 
NEXT TIME THESE TWO MEET THE OTTERS WILL HAVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE 
IT'S ALSO GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR THE YOUNG 
WHO LEARN ABOUT THE CAPABILITIES OF THIS POTENTIAL PREDATOR 
THERE WILL BE TIMES IN EVERY OTTER'S LIFE WHEN THEY WON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE REST OF THE GROUP 
PEACE RETURNS TO THE LAKE AND THE OTTERS RESUME FISHING 
PINK EAR HAS CAUGHT A LARGE FISH 
BUT AFTER EXPENDING SO MUCH ENERGY ON THE CAIMAN ATTACK 
SHE'S UNWILLING TO SHARE HER PRIZE 
IN ANY CASE IT IS TIME FOR THE YOUNG TO BECOME MORE INDEPENDENT 
THEY'RE NOW TWELVE MONTHS OLD AND IT'S TIME THEY HUNTED FOR THEMSELVES 
BUT THE YOUNGSTERS WILL DO ANYTHING FOR A FREE MEAL 
EVEN IF THAT MEANS STEALING 
THOUGH THEFT DOESN'T ALWAYS PAY OFF 
DESPITE HER REFUSAL TO SHARE HER FISH 
PINK EAR IS AN ATTENTIVE MOTHER SPENDING TIME GROOMING HER FAMILY 
KEEPING FUR IN GOOD CONDITION IS VITAL FOR THE OTTERS 
AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY 
CAN HELP YOU REACH PARTS THAT YOU COULD NEVER REACH BY YOURSELF 
UNLIKE THE CLOSE KNIT SOCIETY OTTERS ARE BORN INTO 
BABY CAIMAN HAVE LITTLE FAMILY SUPPORT AT THIS AGE 
THEY'RE THE SIZE OF THE AVERAGE FISH AND AN OTTER COULD EASILY EAT THEM 
THEY MUST KEEP ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE HUNGRY OTTERS 
BUT THE CAIMAN MOTHER IS NOT WITHOUT SOME MATERNAL INSTINCTS 
IF SHE'S WITHIN EARSHOT OF THE ALARM CALLS OF HER YOUNG SHE WILL OCCASIONALLY COME TO THEIR DEFENCE 
AND THIS CAN BRING HER INTO CONFLICT WITH THE OTTERS 
THIS IS WHERE BEING IN A TEAM PAYS OFF 
PART OF THE GROUP REMAIN ABOVE WATER 
WHILE OTHERS ATTACK THE CAIMAN FROM BELOW 
THE OTTERS COULD SWIM AWAY BUT THIS IS A CHANCE TO GAIN THE UPPER HAND 
AND THE PACK INSTINCT RISES TO THE SURFACE AGAIN 
THE MOTHER SEEMS TO HAVE DIVERTED THE ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE BABIES 
BUT IT'S NOT OVER YET 
ONE OF THE FAMILY SIZES UP THE CAIMAN MOTHER 
THE REST OF THE PACK JOIN IN TO MOB THE CAIMAN 
WITH THEIR GREATER NUMBERS THEY ARE ABLE TO PRESS HOME THEIR ADVANTAGE 
FACED WITH SO MANY AGGRESSORS 
SHE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO BEAT A RETREAT 
THE BABY CAIMAN MUST NOW DEPEND ON THEIR OWN INSTINCTS TO SURVIVE 
YOUNG CAIMAN FACED WITH DANGER 
WILL NORMALLY SUBMERGE AND SWIM AWAY 
BUT WHEN APPROACHED BY A GIANT OTTER THEY REACT VERY DIFFERENTLY 
THEY LEAVE THE WATER ALTOGETHER 
OUT HERE THEY ARE SAFE FROM THE OTTERS 
WHO RARELY LOOK FOR FOOD ON LAND 
THE SOUNDS OF APPROACHING OTTERS EVEN INTIMIDATES ANOTHER BIGGER CAIMAN 
IN FACT ALL BUT THE LARGEST TRY TO KEEP OUT OF THE FAMILY'S WAY 
THE BULLYING TACTICS OF THE OTTER PACK APPEARS TO WORK 
HOWEVER THE OTTERS' LIVES ARE NOT ALL ABOUT HUNTING AND FIGHTING 
THERE'S A FUN SIDE TOO 
ALL OTTERS ARE NATURALLY PLAYFUL 
THIS ROUGH AND TUMBLE IS A DAILY PART OF THEIR ROUTINE 
WHICH ONCE AGAIN HELPS TO STRENGTHEN THE FAMILY AS A UNIT 
IT'S NOT JUST THE YOUNGSTERS THAT PLAY 
THE ADULTS BOTH MALE AND FEMALE ARE JUST AS LIKELY TO TAKE PART 
THE CAIMAN AS ALWAYS ARE NEVER FAR AWAY 
AFTER A VIGOROUS SESSION OF PLAY 
THE OTTERS RETURN TO THEIR DEN FOR THE NIGHT 
SOME NEW FACES ARE APPEARING AT THE ENTRANCE 
OTTER CUBS SPEND THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THEIR LIVES HIDDEN INSIDE THE DEN 
THESE ARE NOW EMERGING FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THE EXISTENCE OF BABIES PERHAPS EXPLAINS WHY 
THE GROUP HAS BEEN SO AGGRESSIVE WITH THE CAIMAN 
THEIR REGULAR SHOW OF STRENGTH 
MAY DETER THE CAIMAN FROM SHOWING TOO MUCH INTEREST IN THE BABIES 
IN GIANT OTTER SOCIETY 
IT'S ONLY THE DOMINANT FEMALE HERE PINK EAR WHO PRODUCES A LITTER 
AND WITH ALMOST CEREMONIAL STYLE 
EACH BABY IS RELIGIOUSLY DUNKED IN THE WATER BY THE ADULTS 
IT'S A HARSH INITIATION TO THE WATER WORLD BUT IT'S CRITICAL THAT THEY ARE MADE FAMILIAR WITH IT QUICKLY 
IT COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH 
FROLICKING WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY 
IS IMPORTANT FOR IMPROVING THE BABIES' CONFIDENCE IN THE WATER 
BUT WITH THE NEW RESPONSIBILITY THE FAMILY BECOME EVEN MORE VIGILANT 
THE FIRST HINT OF TROUBLE TRIGGERS A RAPID CHANGE IN THE GROUP'S MOOD 
A CAIMAN THIS SIZE IS QUITE CAPABLE OF TAKING ONE OF THE BABIES 
AND THE FAMILY KNOWS IT 
THE WOLVES OF THE RIVER ASSEMBLE 
LED ONCE AGAIN BY THE ADULT FEMALE PINK EAR 
OTHERS COME FOR A CLOSER LOOK BUT REMAIN CAUTIOUS 
DISTRACTED BY THE HEAD ON ASSAULT FROM THE OTTERS 
THE CAIMAN IS LEFT EXPOSED IN THE REAR 
TO GET THE BETTER OF THE OTTERS 
A CAIMAN NEEDS TO HAVE SURPRISE ON ITS SIDE 
SURROUNDED IN THE OPEN IT HAS NO ADVANTAGE 
DEFEATED IT RETREATS TO AN OTTER FREE ZONE 
TO RESET A POSSIBLE AMBUSH 
FOR THE TIME BEING THE GROUP MAY HAVE GOT THE BETTER OF THE CAIMAN 
BUT THE BABIES ARE STILL VULNERABLE TO A SURPRISE ATTACK 
AND THE FAMILY DECIDES TO MOVE DEN 
UNTIL THE BABIES ARE MORE INDEPENDENT THE OTTERS MAY MOVE EVERY FEW DAYS 
THOUGH WHEREVER THEY ARE THEY ARE NEVER FAR FROM A WATCHING CAIMAN 
THE MOVE IS NOT AN EASY ONE 
THEY TRAVEL OVER A KILOMETRE WITH THE BABIES HELD TIGHTLY IN THEIR MOUTHS 
IF ONE IS DROPPED IT COULD DROWN 
THIS RESPONSIBILITY MEANS THE ADULTS AND SUB ADULTS DO THE CARRYING 
THOUGH THE REST OF THE GROUP HELP TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR DANGER 
WITH BABIES TO PROTECT THE TABLES HAVE BEEN TURNED 
IT'S NOW THE OTTERS WHO ARE RUNNING SCARED 
GIANT OTTERS USUALLY MOVE THEIR YOUNG DURING THE HOTTEST TIME OF THE DAY 
WHEN CAIMAN ARE LEAST ACTIVE 
THIS REDUCES THE RISK OF A SURPRISE ATTACK WHEN THEY ARE MOST VULNERABLE 
THE PACK KEEPS THE BABIES CLOSE TO THEM 
MAKING IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR A PREDATOR TO GET NEAR 
THE FAMILY HAS SEVERAL DENS AROUND THE LAKE 
AND THROUGHOUT THE YEAR MOVES BETWEEN THEM 
SO NO NEW EXCAVATIONS ARE NEEDED JUST A BIT OF SPRING CLEANING 
PINK EAR CARRIES HER LITTER TO THEIR NEW HOME 
NOW THAT THEY ARE MORE MOBILE THEY WILL HAVE TO BE WATCHED CLOSELY 
SO WHEN THE FAMILY GOES FISHING A BABY SITTER WILL WATCH OVER THE CUBS 
THIS JOB OFTEN FALLS TO ONE OF THE SUB ADULTS 
AT TWO YEARS OLD THIS INDIVIDUAL IS ABOUT TO FACE A NEW CHALLENGE 
THE EMERGENCE OF ANOTHER LITTER MEANS SHE WILL SOON HAVE TO LEAVE THE GROUP 
AND FIND A MATE OF HER OWN 
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF HER FAMILY AND THE WATCHFUL EYE OF PINK EAR 
IT WILL BE A VERY DANGEROUS TIME THE HAZARDS ARE MANY 
THE LESSONS LEARNT IN THIS CLOSE KNIT FAMILY 
WILL STAND HER IN GOOD STEAD FOR WHAT IS TO COME 
ON HER OWN THIS OTTER WILL HAVE TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL 
BUT AS A TEAM THE RIVER WOLF FAMILY 
HAS LITTLE TO FEAR FROM EVEN THE LARGEST CAIMAN
