AT THE MOMENT FOLLOWING UP ON 
THOSE BITS OF INFORMATION THAT THAT INFORMATION SHOULD KEEP COMING 
THROUGH HE COULD ACTUALLY GO AND 
FOLLOW UP ANYTHING FROM ITALY HE HE COULD WITH THE INFORMATION COMING 
THROUGH THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY 
FOR EXAMPLE HIS APPEARANCE MIGHT 
HAVE CHANGED WE ARE FOLLOWING UP 
WHAT WE CAN WE'VE HAD A SIGHTING 
OF SOMEBODY SOUNDING SIMILAR BUT A 
BIT TALLER WE ARE POINTING OUT 
THAT TOM IS FIVE FEET NINE INCHES SANDY HAIR WITH A 
RED BEARD BUT HE MIGHT HAVE SHAVED 
THAT OFF WE HAVE TO BEAR THAT IN 
MIND 
IF THEY SEE HIS FOTO IT'S MIND SOME TIME SINCE THE PHOTOS WERE 
TAKEN AND BEAR THAT MIND IF THEY 
ARE LOOKING OUT FOR HIM BECAUSE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS NOW WE DON'T 
KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE 
THE PHOTOS HE WILL RETAIN SOME 
SIMILARITY HE MAY HAVE CHANGED HIS 
APPEARANCE 
HIS MUM AND DAD SAID APPEARANCE THEY SHOULD BEAR IN MIND BECAUSE HE 
COULD BE AT RELIGIOUS SITES THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT 
ANOTHER PART OF TERI'S JOB RIGHT ARE THE UNIDENTIFIED CASES SHE HAS 
CREATED THIS IMAGE TO FIND OUT WHO 
THIS MAN IS HIS BODY WAS FOUND ON

WAS HE IN 
THE SEARCH NOW SPREADS 
ACROSS EUROPE 
CERTAINLY ALL THE 
INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS HAVE BEEN

WEIGHT HE LOOKED DEPRESSED AND 
NEGLECTED 
BEFORE GLENYS COULD GET NEGLECTED THE MONEY TO FLY TO CRETE SHE IS 
TOLD THE MAN THOUGHT TO BE HER 
HUSBAND HAS DISAPPEARED 
IT IS ONE 
OF THE BIGGEST REREGRETS OF MY LIFE 
WITHIN THAT TWO WEEK PERIOD IF

THERE WAS AN UNDERWATER SEARCH UNIT 
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED 
HOW IT HAD HAPPENED THEY SPENT A 
WHOLE WEEK A WHOLE WEEKEND 
DREDGING THE DOCKLAND WE HAD AN 
UNDERWATER SEARCH UNIT AND 
INQUIRIES IN THAT FIRST WEEK 
HUNDREDS OF HOURS ARE DEVOTED TO 
THE OPERATION BUT NO BODY OR ANY 
OTHER TRACE OF PHILIP IS FOUND AS 
DAYS PAST THEORY STARTS TO 
EMERGE THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN HIS 
SILENCE SILENCE THEY DO KNOW THE NIGHT HE WENT 
MISSING THE BARRACKS WERE GIVING

LIVES AND MIGHT BE USING A 
DIFFERENT NAMEAM 
INDONESIA IS 
COMMONLY CAUSED BY A BLOW TO THE 
HEAD THOUSANDS OF CASES ARE 
DIAGNOSED IN THE U. K. EVERY YEAR

PEOPLE EACH YEAR CAN BE LEFT WITH 
PERMANENT MEMORY LOSS COULD THIS 
BE WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO PHILIP

IMAGE SHOWN AT THE MOMENT IS THE 
ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPH WE HAD WE HAVE 
AN IMAGE HERE IT'S COVERING A 
LARGE AMOUNT OF HIS FACE IT IS 
HAD TO REMOVE THAT FIRST SOME 
OTHER ONES WERE USEFUL REFERENCE 
PHOTOS BUT NOT THAT GREAT TO USE 
WE CAN SEE THE NEW IMAGE YOU HAVE 
TAKEN THIS CAP OFF HIM 
WE HAVE 
TAKEN OF THE CAP AND GIVEHIM A 
GENERIC HAIR STYLE AND ADDING A 
LITTLE BIT OF AGE AS WELL IT'S 
DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHETHER HE WILL 
HAVE GAINED OR LOST ANY WEIGHT HAD 
ANY MAJOR CHANGES BUT GENERALLY 
SPEAKING TRYING TO GIVE HIM A BIT 
OF EXTRA MATURITY 
DO YOU FIND SOME 
FEATURES DON'T CHANGE 
IT'S A WHOLE 
RANGE PEOPLE AGE DIFFERENTLY HE 
WILL STILL KEEP THE UNIQUE FEATURES 
OF HIM HE WILL STILL BE 
RECOGNISABLE BUT CERTAIN THINGS 
WILL CHANGE WITH AGE

WITH AND YOUR EXPERT GUESS AS TO 
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE WE CAN SEE THAT 
HAVE WE GOT THAT IMAGE YOU HAVE 
MANAGE DODD THAT STUFF THINK HE
