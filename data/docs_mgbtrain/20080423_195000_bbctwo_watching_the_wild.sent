BUT FOR CAMERAMAN CHARLIE HAMILTON JAMES 
THEY ARE AN OBSESSION 
TO CHARLIE'S DELIGHT HIS SON FRED IS DEVELOPING THE SAME OBSESSION 
IT'S AN OTTER 
CHARLIE'S DECIDED IT'S FINALLY TIME TO INTRODUCE FRED 
TO HIS MOST TREASURED OTTER WATCHING SPOT 
ON THE WILD AND WINDSWEPT ISLE OF SKYE 
FAR AWAY FROM THE MAYHEM OF MODERN LIFE 
WE'RE GONNA GO AND SPEND THE WEEK IN THAT LITTLE COTTAGE OVER THERE 
WHICH HAS GOT NO ROAD GOING TO IT 
AND IT'S GOT NO ELECTRICITY HAS IT FRED 
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY PHONES OR COMPUTERS OR ANYTHING TO DISTRACT US 
AND WE'RE GONNA SEE WHAT LIFE'S LIKE LIVING LIKE THAT FOR A WEEK 
COME ON LET'S GO AND GET THERE 
THIS COTTAGE IS WHERE CHARLIE CUT HIS TEETH AS A WILDLIFE CAMERAMAN 
IT'S TRULY REMOTE JUST GETTING THERE IS QUITE AN ADVENTURE 
HOW ARE YOU DOING FRED 
GOOD 
LOOK AT ME AHH HA HA HA 
COME ON THEN PULL IT OUT I CAN'T 
ARRGH HA HA HA 
WINTER IS THE BEST SEASON TO SEE OTTERS HERE 
BUT THAT DOES MEAN THAT THE WEATHER IS 
WELL CHALLENGING 
FRED MUST BE WONDERING WHAT HE'S LET HIMSELF IN FOR 
OH GOD 
DADDY IT'S FREEZING COLD 
IT'S TOO COLD 
COME ON FRED 
AHH WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAN YOU DROPPED THE CAMERA 
AND THE WEATHER'S NOT REALLY IMPROVING 
WELL I HAVEN'T EVEN FINISHED UNPACKING THE CAR YET 
NO 
AND THERE'S A MASSIVE HAILSTORM 
NOT QUITE THE WEEK OF WINTER SUN FRED HAD IMAGINED 
BUT AS NIGHT FALLS 
SPIRITS ARE RAISED WITH SOME OLD FASHIONED ENTERTAINMENT 
A 
NOW YOU DANCE 
OH FRED YOU CAN HAVE SOME CRAZY TIMES 
WITHOUT MODERN TECHNOLOGY CAN'T YOU 
H. M. M. H. M. M. 
AS THE DAYS PASS AND THE WEATHER IMPROVES 
THEY START TO SEE SOME WILDLIFE 
THOSE RED BREASTED MERGANSERS AGAIN OVER THERE 
THEY'RE LOVELY NICE AREN'T THEY 
CAN YOU SEE THE MALE AND THE FEMALE 
YEAH THEY REALLY ARE NICE 
IT'S A CHANCE FOR CHARLIE TO PASS ON SOME OF HIS HARD EARNED WISDOM 
DO THE ZOOM 
THIS IS THE ZOOM CONTROL 
WHAT SORT OF DIVER IS IT 
A WHITE THROATED I THINK IT'S A GREAT NORTHERN 
I THINK IT'S A WHITE THROATED YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT 
OH HE'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BOAT LOOK 
CAN YOU FIND HIM 
YEAH I'VE GOT HIM GET IT 
OH HE'S GONE HE'S GONE 
I DID PRESS RECORD SO I DID I DID GET HIM GOOD 
WELL DONE 
FRED'S GETTING A TASTE FOR CAMERAWORK 
AND UNDETERRED BY THE LACK OF OTTERS 
HE FINDS A DIFFERENT SUBJECT TO FILM THAT NIGHT 
FRED WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO 
FILM MICE 
WE'RE GOING TO UM PUT SOME CHEESE 
UM AND SOME CHICKEN PIE BY THE MOUSE'S HOLE 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PUT A CAMERA THERE 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE IT AND COME BACK LATER 
AND SEE IF THE CAMERA'S FILMED THE MOUSE 
HE'S OUT AGAIN I THINK 
GO ON THEN OPEN THE DOOR 
YEAH HA HA HA 
FATHER AND SON ARE BEGINNING TO FOLLOW DIFFERENT OBSESSIONS 
FRED'S IN THE COTTAGE MAKING PLANS FOR HIS MICE 
LEAVING CHARLIE TO ROAM ALONE IN SEARCH OF HIS BELOVED OTTERS 
OTTERS NEED LOTS OF ENERGY TO KEEP WARM IN THIS COLD WEATHER 
AND WITH FOOD SCARCE IN WINTER 
THEY SPEND MORE TIME HUNTING MAKING THEM EASIER TO SEE 
BUT EVEN CHARLIE IS SURPRISED QUITE HOW CLOSE THEY'RE GETTING 
THAT WAS FANTASTIC 
OOH 
BLIMEY HE'S COMING ROUND TO LOOK AT ME 
GOD HE'S AMAZING 
HE'S COMING ROUND TO SEE WHAT I AM 
RIGHT THERE 
THAT'S INCREDIBLE 
THIS OTTER'S OBVIOUSLY NOT SEEN MANY PEOPLE IN ITS LIFE 
IT'S AMAZING LOOK THERE HE IS 
LOOK AT THAT HE KNOWS I'M HERE HE'S JUST SEEN ME 
HE'S HEARD ME AND NOW HE'S COMING FOR A CLOSER LOOK 
LOOK AT THAT 
HE'S TWENTY FEET AWAY 
HE'S ACTUALLY HE'S NOT FRIGHTENED OF ME 
HE'S COMING TO SEE WHAT I AM 
GOD YOU COCKY BLOKE I'VE NEVER MET AN OTTER LIKE THAT 
THAT'S NOT YOUR AVERAGE OTTER 
BUT HE'S SAYING LOOK I'M A BIG BOY THIS IS MY TURF PAL 
THAT'S FANTASTIC 
THIS MAGICAL MOMENT IS JUST WHAT CHARLIE WAS HOPING 
TO SHARE WITH FRED 
BUT FRED IS TOO BUSY PLANNING HIS OWN PET PROJECT 
SO AFTER TALKING TO FRED AND FINDING OUT WHAT HE NEEDS 
IT TURNS OUT WE NEED A. A MOUSE 
PLANK OF WOOD A FERRARI A MOUSE 
A PIECE OF CHEESE AND A MOUSE 
AND ERM A MOUSE A MOUSE 
THIS IS FILM MAKING AT ITS MOST 
INVENTIVE 
SO THERE'S THE FERARRI 
FULL OF CHEESE READY TO MAKE HIS MAIDEN MOUSE VOYAGE 
NO LUCK FIRST TIME 
WILDLIFE FILM MAKERS MUST LEARN PERSEVERANCE 
WAIT FOR IT 
HERE WE GO 
FRED'S CAPTURED A WILDLIFE FILM MAKING FIRST 
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT HE AND HIS DAD CAME HERE FOR 
O. K. WHAT'S GOING ON FRED 
THERE'S AN OTTER 
HE'S COMING ASHORE OH LOOK LOOK YOU CAN SEE HIM JUST DOWN THERE 
OH YEAH WHERE IS HE THERE HE IS 
THERE HE IS 
THERE HE IS 
GONE 
HE'S RIGHT THERE 
BETTER THAN A PLAYSTATION 
FRED'S SMILE SAYS IT ALL 
HEY HEY 
WHETHER IT'S OTTERS OR JUST MICE 
WATCHING THE WILD IS A REMINDER 
THAT LIFE'S GREATEST REWARDS OFTEN COME FROM ITS SIMPLEST PLEASURES 
A PENGUIN WE'VE GOT MORE CHANCE OF FILMING A PENGUIN THAN A KINGFISHER 
AND THAT'S COS WE'VE RUN OUT OF COAL ISN'T IT 
SAY GOODBYE BYE
