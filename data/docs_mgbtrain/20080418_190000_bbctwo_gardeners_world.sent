ANYBODY WHO'S WATCHED GARDENERS' WORLD AT ALL 
WILL KNOW THAT I JUST LOVE COMPOST 
AND I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO ENTHUSE AS MANY VIEWERS AS POSSIBLE 
TO MAKE YOUR COMPOST WITH GREAT LOVE AND CARE 
WELL TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME IS NOT JUST ABOUT COMPOST BUT IT IS ABOUT 
THE PROCESS OF SHARING GARDENING 
OF GARDENING TOGETHER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 
AND ALSO I WILL BE STARTING A NEW GARDEN HERE AT BERRYFIELDS 
CELEBRATING THE SENSES 
HELLO WELCOME TO GARDENERS' WORLD 
I'M ATTACKING THIS PHOTINIA IN THE SPRING GARDEN 
NOW YOU DO SEE PHOTINIAS EVERYWHERE 
THE TRUTH IS I DON'T LIKE IT I'VE NEVER LIKED PHOTINIA 
I THINK THIS IS RATHER A SORT OF MUDDY COLOUR 
IT'S NOT A VIBRANT RED 
AND WE WANT TO CUT IT DOWN BECAUSE ALYS AND I WANT TO CONNECT 
THE ALPINE GARDEN WITH THE SPRING GARDEN 
AND THIS IS BLOCKING THE VIEW THROUGH 
FIRST I'M GOING TO CUT IT BACK 
IF YOU WANT TO PRUNE EVERGREEN PLANTS 
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD TIME TO DO IT 
AND DON'T BE FRIGHTENED BE BOLD 
I'M GOING TO HALVE THIS BEFORE DIGGING IT OUT 
YOU CAN SEE ALREADY JUST BY CUTTING IT BACK 
HOW YOU CAN NOW SEE THE SPRING GARDEN 
WE'VE GOT A WHOLE NEW VISTA THROUGH TO IT 
AND OF COURSE WHAT THIS WILL DO IS CREATE A HOLE 
WHICH WE CAN FILL WITH I THINK PLANTS THAT WILL BE MORE SUITABLE 
FOR THE WOODLAND SETTING THAT IS THE SPRING GARDEN 
NOW THESE ROOTS REALLY ARE ENTRENCHED IN HERE 
BUT I AM GOING TO TAKE TROUBLE IN GETTING THEM OUT 
SO IT WILL TRANSPLANT WELL 
BUT IF YOU'RE TRANSPLANTING ANY MATURE SHRUB LIKE THIS 
DO CUT IT BACK HARD AS WELL AS DIGGING OUT AS MUCH ROOT AS POSSIBLE 
COS THAT WAY YOU GET A BALANCE 
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A REDUCED ROOT SYSTEM 
SO YOU NEED A REDUCED BRANCH AND STEM SYSTEM 
AND THAT WAY IT'LL GROW AWAY 
AND ACTUALLY REACH ITS FORMER HEIGHT MUCH QUICKER 
ALYS YOU COULDN'T COME AND GIVE ME A HAND COULD YOU 
I DON'T REALLY THINK I CAN DO THIS VERY QUICKLY ON MY OWN 
IT'S A BEAST IT IS A BEAST 
NOW IN TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
CAROL WILL BE DOWN IN DEVON 
HELPING JO AND RUSSELL CREATING A NURSERY BED FOR THEM 
OUR JOE IS ON HIS ALLOTMENT 
WHERE HE'S PLANTING GARLIC 
ALYS YOU'LL BE WORKING ON LINKING THESE TWO PARTS OF THE GARDEN 
THE ALPINE GARDEN AND THE SPRING GARDEN 
AND I WILL BE BEGINNING THIS NEW GARDEN HERE AT BERRYFIELDS 
A GARDEN TO CELEBRATE THE SENSES 
I SAID I WAS GOING TO MAKE A GARDEN TO CELEBRATE THE SENSES 
AND I SHALL DO IT HERE IN WHAT WAS 
CAROL'S GARDEN OF SEEDS AND CUTTINGS 
CAROL HAS BEEN IN SHE'S TAKEN WHAT PLANTS SHE NEEDS 
FOR HER OWN GARDEN IN DEVON 
ALYS HAS TAKEN PLANTS FROM THE LONG BORDERS I'VE GOT SOME GEUMS 
WHICH I SHALL BE PLANTING LATER ON IN THE COTTAGE GARDEN 
AND WE'LL ALSO BE BRINGING SOME PLANTS 
TO THE PLANT SWAP AT GARDENERS' WORLD LIVE 
SO EVERYTHING IS BEING REUSED AND RECYCLED 
I'M KEEPING THE BASIC LAYOUT 
BECAUSE IT'LL WORK VERY WELL WITH WHAT I WANT TO DO 
WHEN I SAY A GARDEN TO CELEBRATE THE SENSES 
THE THING TO STRESS HERE 
IS OF COURSE GARDENS INVOLVE THE SENSES 
TASTE TOUCH SIGHT SCENT AND SOUND 
BUT WHAT I WANT TO DO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPACE 
IS REALLY FOCUS ON HOW WE DO THAT 
AND I'M GOING TO LOOK AT PLANTS THAT ARE GOOD FOR SOUND 
WE VERY RARELY PLANT FOR SOUND IN OUR GARDEN 
BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT AND VERY VALUABLE FACTOR 
I'VE GOT SOME MISCANTHUS MISCANTHUS SINENSIS 
THEY'VE BEEN CUT BACK BUT THEY WILL GROW UP TO FIVE F. T. TALL 
AND WHEN THEY'RE GREEN 
THE SOUND OF THE STEMS AND LEAVES MOVING TOGETHER IN THE WIND 
IS A SINUOUS SOUND IT'S LIKE SILK SHIFTING AGAINST EACH OTHER 
AND THEN AS THEY DRY OUT THEY GO INTO AUTUMN AND WINTER 
IT BECOMES A DRIER HARDER SOUND THAT RUSTLES 
SO I SHALL PLANT THEM HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS LARGE BORDER 
TO MAKE A CLUMP AND HOPEFULLY THE WIND WILL MOVE BETWEEN THEM 
AND THROUGH THEM AND THEY'LL RUSTLE AGAINST EACH OTHER 
AND THEY WILL WHISPER 
NOW THE SECOND PLANT I WILL BE PUTTING IN FOR SOUND AT THE MOMENT 
AND THERE'LL BE LOTS MORE 
IS ONE YOU PROBABLY DON'T ASSOCIATE WITH SOUND AND THIS IS HORNBEAM 
NOW I'VE GROWN HORNBEAM FOR MANY YEARS 
AND HERE AT BERRYFIELDS WE HAVE LOTS OF IT 
THIS IS A SEEDLING FROM BERRYFIELDS THAT WE'VE POTTED UP AND GROWN ON 
AND THERE'S NO OTHER PLANT THAT HAS A SOUND QUITE LIKE HORNBEAM 
PARTICULARLY IN WINTER WHEN THE LEAVES ARE DRY 
I'VE OFTEN BEEN IN THE GARDEN ON A STILL DAY NOT A DROP OF RAIN 
AND SUDDENLY HEARD RAIN FALLING 
AND WHAT IT IS IS JUST A GENTLE BREEZE 
THAT ALMOST TINKLES THE HORNBEAM LEAVES 
AND CREATES A SOUND THAT IS EXACTLY LIKE 
THE FIRST PATTERINGS OF RAINFALL IT'S MAGICAL 
NOW AS WELL AS SOUND I WANT TO PLANT A FEW PLANTS TODAY FOR SCENT 
AND THIS IS VIBURNUM BURKWOODII 
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S GOT 
THESE WHITE FLOWERS THEY'RE NOT MY FAVOURITE FLOWERS TO LOOK AT 
THEY'RE FINE AND HAVE AN EVERGREEN BACKGROUND 
BUT IT'S THE SCENT THE FRAGRANCE 
THAT IS WONDERFUL PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT IT'S SO EARLY ON IN THE YEAR 
YOU GET THE BEST OF ITS FRAGRANCE 
REALLY ANY TIME FROM FEBRUARY THROUGH TILL MAY 
AND JUST THEN I JUST CAUGHT A WHIFF OF IT 
IT'S QUITE RICH BUT AT THE SAME TIME ELUSIVE 
A LOVELY LOVELY SMELL 
I'M GOING TO PUT ONE PLANT EITHER SIDE OF THE ENTRANCE HERE 
THE OTHER SCENTED PLANT 
IS MUCH MORE DRAMATIC AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE 
AND THIS IS ROSA PRIMULA 
LIKE ALL SPECIES ROSES THEY ARE SMALL 
THEY FLOWER VERY EARLY IN MAY 
AND THE LEAVES HAVE THE MOST AMAZING INCENSE SMELL 
PARTICULARLY AFTER RAIN WHICH IS JUST AS WELL 
BECAUSE IT'S SHOWERY HERE TODAY 
NOW I'M DIGGING A GOOD DEEP HOLE 
BECAUSE ROSES NEED TO BE PLANTED NICE AND DEEP 
AND I SHALL ADD A LITTLE BIT OF BERRYFIELD COMPOST TO THE BOTTOM 
NOT TO FEED IT BUT TO PROVIDE A DECENT SOIL STRUCTURE 
JUST FOR THE ROOTS TO GET AWAY 
BUT I WILL ADD SOME MYCORRHIZAE 
NOW THIS IS A FUNGUS IT DOESN'T FEED THE PLANT 
BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS ACT AS A CONDUIT 
TO ENABLE THE PLANT TO TAKE UP NUTRIENTS 
NOW ALL WOODY PLANTS DEVELOP THIS ANYWAY 
BUT IF YOU'RE PUTTING ONE IN OR IF YOU'RE MOVING A PLANT 
IT CAN TAKE THEM SOME YEARS TO DEVELOP A DECENT MYCORRHIZAL SYSTEM 
SO YOU'RE SPEEDING UP THE PROCESS THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY 
AND DON'T DIG IT IN WHAT YOU WANT IS FOR THE ROOTS 
TO COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE MYCORRHIZAE 
PUT THEM IN AROUND THE EDGE OF THE HOLE 
LIKE THAT 
NICE AND DEEP 
SO THE SOIL COMES RIGHT TO THE TOP OF THE PLANT 
AND THEN FILL THEM BACK IN 
I THINK I'VE GOT THIS IN BEFORE THE RAIN GETS TOO HEAVY 
THIS WAS CAROL'S GARDEN OF COURSE 
FOR THIS SERIES OF GARDENERS' WORLD SHE'LL BE BASED IN HER HOME GARDEN 
IN DEVON 
GROWING AND NURTURING PLANTS 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT THE HEART OF MY APPROACH TO GARDENING 
IT SHOULD BE THE STARTING POINT 
ALMOST THE BEGINNING OF THE CYCLE IN EVERYONE'S GARDEN 
WHETHER YOU'RE GROWING IN A GREENHOUSE ON A WINDOWSILL 
OR IN YOUR VERY OWN NURSERY BED 
THIS IS A HUGE SPACE REALLY FOR A NURSERY BED 
AND I'VE CHUCKED SOME REALLY AWFUL ASPARAGUS OUT OF IT 
COS IT WASN'T PRODUCTIVE ANY MORE 
AND I WANT TO MAKE MUCH MUCH BETTER USE OF IT 
I'M JUST GOING TO ADD SOME OF THIS DELICIOUS COMPOST TO IT 
THIS BED I SEE AS BECOMING THE VERY HUB 
OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE GARDEN IT'S THE CENTRE 
THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO START WITH IS A GERANIUM 
AND IT'S ONE THAT'S REALLY SORT OF POT BOUND 
THAT'LL DO FOR NOW 
AND IT'S GERANIUM HIMALAYENSE 
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS PLANT FOR AGES 
PROBABLY TWO YEARS POOR OLD THING 
WHILE IT'S BEEN GROWING IN HERE 
THINKING I'VE GOT TO PLANT IT OUT 
BUT NOW I'M NOT GOING TO PLANT IT OUT STRAIGHTAWAY 
I'M GOING TO PLANT BITS OF IT OUT 
BUT I THINK THIS POTFUL IS GOING TO MAKE 
PROBABLY ABOUT TWENTY PLANTS 
IF I TAKE REALLY GOODLY CHUNKS LIKE THIS 
TAKE A BIT OF MOSS FROM ROUND THE TOP 
I'M GOING TO TUCK THEM IN HERE JUST NESTLE IT INTO THAT SOIL 
AND IMMEDIATELY IT'S GOING TO FIND ALL THIS ENERGY 
TO GROW OUTWARDS AND INCREASE 
GERANIUM HIMALAYENSE IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GERANIUMS 
IT'S A REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD CRANESBILL 
IT FLOWERS SORT OF JUNE AND JULY 
IT'S GOT LOVELY SOFT BLUE FLOWERS 
I THINK THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE TO SPLIT STUFF 
I'M LIFTING OUT OF THE GARDEN TO DIVIDE IT UP 
SEPARATE IT PUT IT IN HERE LET IT INCREASE BEAUTIFULLY 
THEN WE CAN DECIDE JUST WHAT TO DO WITH IT 
BUT RIGHT NOW I WANT TO GO AND FETCH 
THIS GREAT BIG FAT MOLINIA PLANT 
THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO BE DIVIDING GRASSES 
IT'S THE ONLY TIME REALLY 
BEFORE THEY'RE INTO FULL GROWTH 
BUT WHEN THEY'VE GOT THROUGH THE WINTER AND THE SOIL'S WARMED UP 
THIS IS MOLINIA CAERULEA TRANSPARENT 
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GRASSES TREMENDOUSLY GRACEFUL 
AS WELL AS WANTING TO DIVIDE 
ALL SORTS OF THINGS OUT OF HERE 
I'VE GOT ABSOLUTELY QUEUES OF PLANTS JUST VYING WITH EACH OTHER 
TO BE THE FIRST INTO THAT NURSERY BED 
AND THEY'RE ALL WAITING IN THE GREENHOUSE 
THEY'VE ALL GOT THIS TREMENDOUS LUST FOR LIFE 
AND THIS YOU KNOW DESPERATE NEED TO GET GROWING 
IT'S SO EXCITING ISN'T IT 
ALL THESE THINGS JUST PUSHING FORWARDS 
IT'S THAT TIME OF THE YEAR 
AND THIS IS THE MOLINIA CAERULEA ARUNDINACEA TRANSPARENT 
THE STUFF THAT I COLLECTED LAST AUTUMN 
AND IT'S GERMINATED 
IT DIDN'T GERMINATE FOR AGES AND I GOT REALLY WORRIED 
I'VE OBVIOUSLY SOWN SOME FOXGLOVES ON THE TOP 
BUT THESE LITTLE BABIES 
AREN'T READY TO GO INTO THE NURSERY BED YET 
THERE'S A STAGE IN BETWEEN 
I NEED TO TAKE THEM PRICK THEM OUT AND BRING THEM BACK IN HERE 
JUST FOR A FEW WEEKS 
BEFORE THEY FINALLY TAKE UP RESIDENCE OVER THERE 
AND THEN WHO KNOWS ON TO OTHER PARTS OF THE GARDEN 
OR INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S GARDENS 
SO THIS IS A VERY GOOD SORT OF TEMPORARY MODULE TRAY 
IT'S JUST CARDBOARD AND OUR LOVELY COMPOST 
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW IS JUST HAVING LOOSENED THOSE UP 
TAKE EACH OF THESE GRASSES OUT 
JUST CAREFULLY ALREADY GOT A LOVELY LITTLE ROOT SYSTEM ON IT 
JUST PUT ONE IN THEY'LL GROW VERY RAPIDLY REALLY QUICKLY 
THESE INDIVIDUAL COMPARTMENTS MEAN 
THE WHOLE THINGS CAN BE LIFTED OUT WHEN THEY'VE ROOTED 
AND THERE WON'T BE ANY ROOT DISTURBANCE AT ALL 
AND LOTS AND LOTS OF THEM ARE GOING TO END UP IN THAT NURSERY BED 
BUT I'VE GOT SO MANY THINGS THAT I'M WANTING TO PUT IN THERE 
I'M GOING TO PLANT CALENDULAS POT MARIGOLDS 
FOR A BIT OF SORT OF COMPANION PLANTING 
AND I'VE GOT MY SWEET PEAS THAT ARE JUST CHAMPING AT THE BIT 
I'M REALLY DYING TO PUT THEM IN TOO 
THIS BED'S GOING TO BE REALLY PIVOTAL IN THE YEAR AHEAD 
AND IN MY GARDEN'S CYCLE 
I WANT TO SHARE WHAT I'M DOING AND FINDING OUT 
WITH THE LOVELY JO AND RUSS 
WHO WANT TO GROW A GARDEN FROM ALMOST NOTHING 
BY SWAPPING SHARING AND OF COURSE GROWING THEIR OWN 
EVERY NEW GARDEN HAS TO BEGIN SOMEWHERE 
AND LATER ON I'M GOING TO GET THEM STARTED WITH A NURSERY BED 
ALL OF THEIR OWN 
I DO LOVE PRIMROSES 
THEY ARE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SPRING FLOWERS 
AND THEY'RE QUITE GOOD TO EAT TOO 
CERTAINLY VERY PRETTY WHEN SPRINKLED ON A SALAD 
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF FLOWERS THAT YOU CAN GROW FOR THEIR TASTE 
I'VE GOT SOME HEMEROCALLIS CITRINA HERE 
ALMOST EVERY PART OF IT CAN BE EATEN 
AND I SHALL BE PUTTING THIS INTO MY GARDEN OF THE SENSES 
BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT I WANT TO MAKE A VEGETABLE GARDEN 
A LITTLE MINI VEGETABLE GARDEN TO ILLUSTRATE TASTE AS A SENSE 
WE'VE GOT A REALLY NICE VEGETABLE GARDEN JUST NEXT DOOR 
AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT PRODUCING TASTY FOOD 
I WANT TO BE MORE ANALYTICAL THAN THAT 
I WANT TO LOOK AT HOW TASTE WORKS AND TRY AND BREAK IT DOWN 
TO ITS COMPONENT PARTS 
I'VE GOT SOME SORREL HERE 
WHICH IS THE NEAREST THING YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO PURE SOURNESS 
IN A PLANT 
IT'S JUST LIKE LEMON 
IT'S ACTUALLY DELICIOUS 
BUT IT'S A VERY PURE SHARP TASTE 
I'VE ALSO TAKEN A BIT OF THE BLOOD VEIN SORREL 
WHICH WE GROW IN THE LONG BORDER AND I'LL PUT THIS IN THIS GARDEN TOO 
SO WE'LL HAVE TWO TYPES OF SORREL 
REALLY TO EPITOMISE SOURNESS 
AND I'VE GOT SOME SEED HERE OF RADICCHIO 
BECAUSE CHICORY IN ALL ITS FORMS 
IS THE NEAREST THING YOU GET TO PURE BITTERNESS IN A PLANT 
THIS IS PALLA ROSSA WHICH NOT ONLY WILL LOOK GOOD 
BUT IT WILL GIVE THAT PURE ELEMENT OF BITTERNESS 
AND FOR SWEETNESS I'VE JUST PLANTED A PEACH 
BECAUSE A PEACH SEEMS TO ME WHEN IT'S JUICY AND RIPE 
ALMOST THE PERFECT SWEETNESS 
NOW THE NEXT SENSE I'LL BE LOOKING AT IS TOUCH 
THERE ARE SOME PLANTS THAT JUST ARE IRRESISTIBLE 
AND YOUR HANDS REACH FOR THEM AND YOU HAVE TO CARESS THEM 
THIS GRASS IS A STIPA STIPA TENUISSIMA 
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS PLANT A LITTLE 
NOT A HEDGE OF THEM JUST A ROW 
THE IDEA BEING THAT AS YOU WALK ALONG 
IT'S JUST HIGH ENOUGH FOR YOUR HANDS TO TOUCH AS YOU GO PAST 
NOW THIS STIPA IS A PLANT THAT LIKES GOOD DRAINAGE 
IT DOESN'T NEED RICH SOIL 
IT'S GOT FAIRLY SHALLOW ROOTS 
BUT GOOD DRAINAGE AND SUNSHINE 
AND 
YOU DON'T NEED TO CUT IT BACK 
WE DIVIDED THESE A FEW DAYS AGO 
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO DIVIDE THEM IN SPRING 
BECAUSE THEY CAN SIT AND SULK AND BE VERY UNHAPPY 
IF YOU DIVIDE THEM IN AUTUMN 
LET THEM GROW LET THEM SURVIVE THE WINTER 
THEN DIVIDE THEM IN SPRING 
AND THEY SHOULD GROW AWAY 
I'VE GOT SOME HERE WHICH HAVE BEEN CUT BACK 
IN PRACTICE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY NEED TO DO THAT 
YOU CAN JUST PULL THEM OUT 
JUST PULL OUT THE OLD GROWTH AGAIN IT'S A TACTILE RELATIONSHIP 
USE YOUR HANDS 
AND THE WHOLE PROCESS OF ENGAGING WITH A PLANT 
THE FEELING THE SOIL IS ALL PART OF GARDENING 
I CAN'T IMAGINE GARDENING WITHOUT GETTING HOLD OF THE SOIL 
AND LEARNING ABOUT IT THROUGH WHAT MY FINGERS ARE TELLING ME 
AS MUCH AS MY EYES OR MY BRAIN 
SO I'LL PLANT A LITTLE ROW WE CAN PLANT OTHER THINGS BETWEEN THEM 
BUT IT'S THIS RHYTHM OF TOUCH THAT THEY'LL CREATE 
NOW I SHARE THIS GARDEN WITH YOU EVERY WEEK 
MILLIONS OF YOU 
BUT FOR MOST OF US 
THE BEST WAY OF SHARING A GARDEN IS SIMPLY TO OPEN IT TO THE PUBLIC 
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY WILL COME 
BUT WHOEVER DOES ENTERS INTO YOUR WORLD 
AND BECOMES PART OF YOUR GARDEN 
AND WE WENT ALONG TO JANE A. N. N. WALTON'S GARDEN IN NORFOLK 
AS SHE PREPARED TO OPEN HER GARDEN TO FELLOW AURICULAR ENTHUSIASTS 
I THINK THE ATTRACTION OF AURICULAS WAS SEEING THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME 
AT CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO 
AND IT JUST MADE THEM LOOK SO SPECIAL AND JEWEL LIKE AND ARISTOCRATIC 
I JUST THOUGHT YEAH I'D LIKE TO HAVE A GO 
I STARTED SEEING THEM ON THE LOCAL MARKET ACTUALLY FOR SALE 
SO I'VE KEPT GOING ON A THURSDAY AND JUST BUYING A FEW AND A FEW MORE 
SO IT'S GROWN TO QUITE A MODEST COLLECTION REALLY 
OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CULTIVARS 
AND THAT MEANS ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED IN POTS AT ANY ONE TIME 
I MEAN IF YOU WANT TO KEEP A CULTIVAR GOING 
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO IT IS BY DIVISION 
IF YOU SET SEED YOU MIGHT END UP WITH SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
I DO MOST OF MY DIVISION IN SEPTEMBER 
BUT YOU CAN DO IT ANY TIME AFTER FLOWERING 
AND REALLY YOU CAN BREAK IT DOWN INTO AS MANY LITTLE SEPARATE PIECES 
AS YOU NEED 
I MIX UP MY OWN COMPOST 
AND I LIKE TO KNOW HOW MUCH LIME CHARCOAL FEED 
AND SO ON I'VE GOT IN IT 
THEN ONCE THE OFFSETS HAVE BEEN PUT IN THEIR POTS 
THEY GO OUTSIDE IN A SHADY PLACE 
AND YOU HAVE TO BE QUITE CAREFUL WITH THE WATERING AT THAT STAGE 
IF THEY HAVEN'T GOT ROOT ON THEY CAN ROT QUITE QUICKLY 
THE WEATHER'S AGAINST US TODAY 
BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND A FEW DECENT LOOKING FLOWERS 
THAT WE CAN PUT ON DISPLAY 
WE'VE HAD AN AMAZINGLY HOT APRIL 
AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO HOLD THESE BACK 
SO THIS ONE'S SIRIUS WHICH IS AN ALPINE AURICULA 
THAT'S NOT TOO BAD 
THIS ONE SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY GO OVER IN THE HEAT 
THE COLOUR BLEEDS OUT 
THIS IS ONE THAT GOT CAUGHT IN THE RAIN 
AND YOU CAN SEE A SHOW AURICULA HAS A LOT MORE FARINA ON IT 
THIS POWDERY WHITE STUFF LOOKS LIKE TALCUM POWDER 
AND WHEN IT GETS RAIN ON IT 
IT JUST GOES LIKE FLOUR AND WATER PASTE AND SPREADS OVER THE FLOWER 
AND SPOILS IT 
THAT'S WHY I AND MOST OF THE OTHER GROWERS WOULD BE GROWING UNDER GLASS 
I THINK THIS IS THE PLANTS THAT I'VE NARROWED DOWN 
TO BEING POSSIBILITIES FOR HAVING ON DISPLAY FOR THE OPEN DAY 
THIS ONE HERE SERENITY IS THE FIRST GREEN THAT I EVER BOUGHT 
GREENS AREN'T TERRIBLY EASY TO GET INTO FLOWER 
YOU CAN GO FIVE YEARS WAITING FOR A FLOWER AND NOT ACTUALLY GET ONE 
WHAT I'M GOING TO NEED TO DO TO THIS IS TO TAKE OUT THE RUBBISH 
WE'VE GOT SOME DEAD BIRCH LEAVES HERE THAT HAVE DROPPED IN 
WE'VE GOT A YELLOW LEAF ON THE PLANT THERE 
WHICH NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OFF 
JUST CAREFULLY PULL IT AWAY 
AND BITS OF THE FARINA FROM THE CENTRE HAVE SPREAD OUT 
SO I'LL TRY AND GET THEM OFF WITH A COTTON BUD 
I'LL PROBABLY STAKE IT LATER 
BUT THE ONES THAT REALLY NEED STAKING ARE THE DOUBLES 
AND WHAT I USE IS KEBAB STICKS 
WHICH ARE PAINTED A SIMILAR COLOUR TO THE FARINA 
AND I TEND TO USE COLOURED GREEN RAFFIA 
WHICH BLENDS IN QUITE WELL 
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE DOUBLES 
I JUST LOVE THE COMBINATION OF THIS PRIMROSE YELLOW 
WITH THE LILAC EDGE 
IT'S BRILLIANT BECAUSE IT FLOWERS FOR A VERY LONG SEASON 
IT'S PROBABLY OUT FOR A GOOD MONTH 
IT REALLY ADDS TO THE ENJOYMENT 
TO STAGE THE AURICULAS FOR THE OPEN DAYS 
I LIKE TO HAVE ALL THE GOLD CENTRED ALPINES IN ONE THEATRE 
THE SHOWS IN ANOTHER THEATRE 
THE DOUBLES I THINK LOOK QUITE GOOD 
ON AN OLD LADDER FROM A GYPSY CARAVAN 
AND I THINK THEY HAVE MORE IMPACT 
IF YOU COMBINE THEM ACCORDING TO THE COLOURS 
RATHER THAN JUST MIX THEM ALL UP IN A JUMBLE 
I SHOULD THINK I'VE BEEN OPENING THE GARDEN FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS 
I THINK THE WORST THING IS TRYING TO FIX THE DATE REALLY 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER'S GOING TO DO OBVIOUSLY 
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COMING 
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CAKES TO MAKE 
AND THE REST OF THE GARDEN TO GET LOOKING GOOD FOR THE DAY 
IS THAT SIRIUS AT THE BOTTOM YES 
I HAVE TO SAY IT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITES IT'S ONE OF MINE 
IT'S GREAT ACTUALLY WE'VE FORMED A REAL FRIENDSHIP AMONGST OURSELVES 
AND IT'S LOVELY JUST TO HAVE THE AURICULAS IN THEIR THEATRES 
AND INVITE EVERYONE ROUND FOR TEA 
EVEN WHEN I'M NOT HAVING THE GARDEN OPEN 
IT'S MORE PLEASURABLE BECAUSE WE CAN JUST SIT DOWN 
AND HAVE A GOOD OLD CHAT ABOUT AURICULAS IT'S GREAT FUN 
ALPINES REALLY ROCK AT THIS TIME OF YEAR 
THEY'RE IN FULL FLOWER AND FULL SWING 
AND NOW IS THE TIME LOOK AT THEM 
SO I SUGGEST IF YOU HAVE AN ALPINE HOUSE OR ROCK GARDEN NEAR YOU 
GO AND VISIT IT NOW 
THEY'RE ALSO A REALLY GOOD IDEA IF YOU'VE GOT JUST A VERY SMALL SPACE 
THEY LIKE LOTS OF SUN THEY HAVE FAIRLY LOW WATERING REQUIREMENTS 
AND THEY'LL EVEN TAKE FAIRLY BAKED WINDOW SILLS 
IF YOU CHOOSE THE TOUGHER ONES LIKE SAXIFRAGE 
AND IN HERE RIGHT NOW JUST LOOKS HEAVENLY 
THE INSIDE MIGHT BE LOOKING GLORIOUS 
BUT OUTSIDE HASN'T FARED QUITE SO WELL 
THIS SIDE IS LOOKING LOVELY AND IS REALLY BEGINNING TO BED DOWN 
BUT THIS SIDE HAS BEEN SUFFERING A LITTLE 
BECAUSE THIS TREE HAS SLOWLY BUT SURELY 
GROWN RIGHT THE WAY ACROSS THE PATH AND IS NOW SHADING THIS AREA 
SO BY THE TIME YOU GET TO SUMMER THIS IS REALLY QUITE DARK SHADE 
RATHER THAN THE KIND OF DAPPLE SHADE 
THAT THE PLANTS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY HERE NEEDED 
THEY WERE BEGINNING TO SUFFER AND GROW LEGGY AND LOOK RATHER UNATTRACTIVE 
RATHER THAN SEE THIS AS A FAILURE 
WE SAW IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNITE THE WOODLAND AND ALPINE GARDEN 
SO I REMOVED ALL THE PLANTS AND FOUND THEM NEW HOMES 
I'VE TAKEN UP THE GEOTEXTILE LAYER 
AND I'VE TURNED THIS INTO GOOD RICH WOODLAND SOIL 
SO I'VE ADDED A LOT OF COMPOST I'VE ADDED A LOT OF COMPOSTED BARK 
AND AN AWFUL LOT OF LEAF MOULD 
TO HOPEFULLY TURN THIS INTO VERY RICH WOODLAND SOIL 
WE'VE CHOSEN PLANTS THAT WILL REALLY MARRY THE WOODLAND AND ALPINE GARDEN TOGETHER 
YOU MAY THINK WE'VE CHOSEN THIS ONE JUST FOR ITS MAGNIFICENT FOLIAGE 
AND THAT TRULY IS A BONUS OF IT 
IT'S AN ASARUM MAXIMUM SILVER PANDA 
BUT UNDERNEATH THE FOLIAGE 
ARE THESE ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY LOOKING FLOWERS 
THESE ARE REALLY DARK EXOTIC THINGS 
THAT APPEAR IN SPRING 
THESE FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY FUNGUS GNATS 
AND THIS SORT OF INCREDIBLE RIPPLED MARKING IN THE INSIDE OF THE FLOWER 
IS TO A FUNGUS GNAT JUST LIKE A MUSHROOM 
SO I'M GOING TO PLACE THEM IN THE SHADE OF THIS NORTH FACING WALL 
BECAUSE THEY DO NEED QUITE DEEP SHADE 
WE'VE ALSO CHOSEN THIS POLYPOID OUR NATIVE POLYPOID 
THIS IS A LOVELY LITTLE FERN THAT WILL DO WELL IN THESE CONDITIONS 
IT'S SLIGHTLY TOUGHER THAN THE ASARUM 
SO I'M GOING TO PUT IT IN FRONT OF IT TO CREATE A BIT MORE SHADE 
AND REALLY MAKE THIS FEEL VERY WOODLANDY 
AND THE OTHER FERN IS 
A HELL OF A NAME FOR SUCH A PRETTY LITTLE THING 
BASICALLY OUR NATIVE LADY FERN 
AND IT'S A VERY GENTLE LITTLE THING WITH THIS LOVELY ACID GREEN COLOUR 
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS THIS WONDERFUL PLANT 
WHICH IS CALLED ARISAEMA FLAVUM 
WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLE EXOTIC EXTRAORDINARY LOOKING PLANT 
BUT I DON'T THINK WORDS CAN REALLY JUSTIFY HOW AMAZING IT LOOKS 
THEY REALLY DO MUCH BETTER IF PLANTED IN THEIR DORMANT STAGE 
BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY FRAGILE AND WOULDN'T TAKE TO BEING THUMPED OUT 
I'M JUST TAKING A MOMENT OR TWO TO ENJOY WHAT I THINK IS THE BEST OF BERRYFIELDS THIS WEEK 
DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN UNDERNEATH THE HORSE CHESTNUT 
WHOSE STICKY BUDS ARE JUST BEGINNING TO OPEN OUT INTO FLOWER 
IF YOU REMEMBER I BUILT THIS SEAT LAST AUTUMN 
AND UNDERPLANTED IT WITH STRAWBERRIES 
AND UNDERPLANTED THE CHESTNUT WITH BULBS 
AND THE ANEMONES LOOK FANTASTIC WITH THEIR STARRY BLUE FLOWERS 
BUT WHAT I PARTICULARLY LIKE ARE THE PRIMULAS 
AND I'VE GOT THREE OF OUR NATIVE PRIMULAS FLOWERING TOGETHER 
THERE'S THE LAST OF THE SEASON'S PRIMROSES 
PRIMULA VULGARIS 
AND BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SUCH A COLD APRIL 
THE PRIMROSES HAVE STAYED IN FLOWER MUCH LONGER THAN LAST YEAR 
AND I LOVE PRIMROSES 
AND THEN NEXT TO THEM WE'VE GOT THE COWSLIP PRIMULA VERIS 
AND OF COURSE IN THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT 
COWSLIP BELONGS TO THE OPEN MEADOWS AND DOWNLANDS 
THEY WOULDN'T REALLY BE GROWING SIDE BY SIDE 
THEN WE'VE GOT THE OXLIP PRIMULA ELATIOR 
WHICH IS ANOTHER WOODLAND PRIMULA GROWING ALONG THE EDGE 
OF OUR WILDFLOWER MEADOW UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES 
THEY'RE JUST LOOKING FABULOUS 
THEY'LL ONLY LAST FOR A WEEK OR SO 
AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WHEN YOU GET THESE MOMENTS OF FLOWERING 
TO STOP AND RELISH THEM 
NOW STILL LOTS MORE TO COME ON THE PROGRAMME 
I'LL BE GOING BACK TO DO MORE ON OUR GARDEN OF THE SENSES 
AND WE SHALL CONTINUE THIS THEME OF GARDENING AS A SHARED EXPERIENCE 
SO CAROL WILL BE HELPING JO AND RUSSELL CREATE THEIR OWN NURSERY BED 
AND WE'LL BE GOING TO CHARLBURY RAILWAY STATION 
WHERE A GROUP OF ILLUSTRIOUS FRIENDS ARE GARDENING TOGETHER 
AND WE SHALL BE PAYING ANOTHER VISIT TO JOE'S ALLOTMENT 
IF YOU SAW LAST WEEK'S PROGRAMME 
YOU WILL HAVE SEEN JOE STRUGGLING WITH THE HARD WORK 
THAT HAS TO BE PUT IN TO ESTABLISHING AN ALLOTMENT 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU FIRST GET IT 
BUT THIS WEEK HE DOES START PLANTING 
HE ALSO DISCOVERS THAT IF YOU HAVE AN ALLOTMENT 
YOU NEED NEVER GARDEN ALONE 
IT'S BEEN GOING PRETTY WELL REALLY 
I'VE GOT MOST OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN NOW 
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT SEVEN WEEKS SOMETHING LIKE THAT I STARTED 
YOU KNOW GOT THE SHED UP 
THIS HAS GOT TO BE KEN 
BUT LOOK AT THIS VERANDA OUT OF THIS PALLET DECKING STUFF 
I'VE JUST PLACED IT DOWN AND PUT A BIT OF BARK IN BETWEEN 
AND THEN THE PATH OUT OF THE SAME MATERIAL 
JUST GOES STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE 
BIT OF LANDSCAPE FABRIC UNDERNEATH KEEP THE WEEDS OUT 
THE WEEDS OVER THERE ARE UNBELIEVABLE 
THAT MARE'S TAIL IS COMING THROUGH 
YOU SEE HOW MUCH GROWTH IT'S PUT ON 
BUT EVERYWHERE THAT I PLANT I HAVE TO DIG WEED WEED AGAIN 
DIG AGAIN INCORPORATE THE COMPOST 
GOTTA GO OVER IT THREE OR FOUR TIMES JUST TO GET IT READY FOR PLANTING 
SO IT'S SLOW 
WELL I'M GETTING TO KNOW A FEW NAMES OF THE GUYS HERE 
THIS GUY'S CALLED MANUEL 
HI MANUEL HI 
HOW'S IT GOING FINE 
IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL THE WAY YOU'VE LAID IT OUT 
NOW IT IS O. K. BUT I WORK VERY HARD 
SO WHAT GROWS WELL AROUND HERE 
I GROW SOME BROAD BEAN SOME SHALLOTS 
ONION GARLIC 
THEY'RE REALLY DOING NICELY 
YOU WANT SOME 
WHAT SOME SOME GARLIC 
LIKE THIS LIKE READY GROWING 
YES I CAN GIVE TO YOU THAT TWO ROW 
LISTEN IT'S YOUR NO I HAVE A LOT YOU SEE THAT 
I HAVE ANOTHER TWO SQUARES OVER THERE 
ARE YOU SURE I'M SURE REALLY SURE 
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO GIVE YOU BACK YET DON'T WORRY 
DO YOU WANT SOME MORE WEEDS NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
KEEP THE WEEDS AS WELL 
BIT OF A COUP JOE ISN'T IT THAT IS A REAL RESULT YES 
BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH NO PROBLEM 
I APPRECIATE THAT I WILL REPAY YOU SOMEHOW ONE DAY 
NO I'M FINE 
I'M GONNA GET THEM IN THE GROUND QUICKLY BEFORE THEY GET DRY 
DON'T PUT MUCH DEEP HOW MUCH ABOUT HERE 
YEAH FROM THERE O. K. O. K. 
PLANT THEM FIRM THEM IN WATER 
BUT NOT THE LEAVES JUST THE O. K. 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT 
MY FIRST PLANTS WHICH ARE GOING IN ARE READY GROWN 
CAN'T BE BAD EH 
BUT I'M GONNA GET THEM IN BEFORE THEY DRY OUT 
AND I'M JUST GONNA RAKE OUT A LITTLE TRENCH HERE 
I'VE GOT SOME MORE GARLIC AND SOME ONIONS AND SHALLOTS THAT I'VE BROUGHT DOWN HERE 
THAT I REALLY WANNA DO SOMETHING WITH TODAY START MOVING ON 
BUT I'VE BEEN READING SOMEWHERE THAT IT'S AN IDEA TO POT THEM UP 
BEFORE PUTTING THEM STRAIGHT IN THE GROUND 
THESE ARE O. K. COS THEY'VE GROWN ON A BIT BUT APPARENTLY IF THE SOIL'S A BIT WET 
YOU'RE BETTER OFF POTTING THEM UP GETTING SOME ROOTS ON THEM 
I'M GONNA GIVE MONTY A BUZZ TO SEE WHAT HE THINKS 
HELLO MONTY 
OH HELLO HI HOW ARE YOU 
I'M ALL RIGHT I'M ON A TRAIN' 
YOU'RE ON A TRAIN 
I'VE GOT SOME ONION SETS AND SHALLOTS AND SOME GARLIC 
I READ SOMEWHERE THAT IT'S POSSIBLY BETTER 
TO POT THEM UP BEFORE PUTTING THEM STRAIGHT IN THE GROUND WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IF THE SETS SIT IN THE SOIL WITHOUT GROWING WHICH THEY WILL DO IF IT'S TOO COLD 
BIRDS TAKE THEM OUT THEY GET DISCOLOURED THEY GET DISLODGED 
IN THE SOIL BASICALLY YOU'VE GOT A PLANT SITTING THERE WAITING TO HAPPEN 
WHICH IS NOT A GOOD THING 
YOU CAN PUT THEM INTO PLANTS' YEAH 
THEY'LL DEVELOP ROOTS THEN YOU'LL SEE A GREEN SHOOT GROW YEAH 
AND THEN WHEN THE SOIL IS READY YOU CAN TRANSPLANT THE PLANT WITH THE ROOTS 
THAT MEANS YOU WANT TO BE DISTURBING THE ROOTS' 
O. K. BRILLIANT THANKS MONTY 
NICE TO TALK TO YOU NICE TO TALK TO YOU AND I'LL SEE YOU SOON 
THANKS MONTY BYE 
ONION SETS ARE SMALL BULBS THAT HAVE SIMPLY STOPPED GROWING 
SO GIVEN THE RIGHT CONDITIONS THEY'LL START GROWING AGAIN 
THIS IS RED BARON A RED SKIN VARIETY WITH PINK AND WHITE FLESH 
APPARENTLY A GOOD CROPPER SHOULD BE GOOD FOR SALADS AS WELL AS COOKING AND STORES WELL 
BUT THERE'S NO CHANCE OF THAT IN MY HOUSE 
THIS IS A GARLIC I'M PUTTING IN GARLIC MARCO 
AND THESE COME AS COMPLETE BULBS 
LOOK AT THAT THAT'S HOW YOU BUY THEM YOU SPLIT THEM UP INTO INDIVIDUAL SETS LIKE THAT 
FOR EACH CLOVE OF GARLIC I'M GONNA GET ONE OF THOSE AT THE END OF THE YEAR 
WHICH IS PROBABLY TWENTY TIMES BIGGER THAN THAT 
THEY'LL BE READY ABOUT JULY AND THESE ARE REALLY GOOD FOR STORING 
WHICH IS GOOD 
I'VE HEARD THAT YOU CAN GROW JUST THE GARLIC THAT YOU GET FROM SUPERMARKETS 
BUT SOME OF THEM HAVE GOT VIRUSES YOU'RE NOT GUARANTEED SUCCESS 
THESE ARE GROWN THESE BULBS ESPECIALLY FOR THE CLOVES TO BE GROWN ON AREN'T THEY 
THIS WAY I SHOULD BE GUARANTEED SOME GOOD PRODUCE 
FOR THE SHALLOTS I'M PLANTING GOLDEN GOURMET AND RED SUN 
OBVIOUS WHAT THEY ARE REALLY YELLOW AND RED SHALLOTS 
LIKE THE GARLIC YOU PLANT ONE AND GET A CLUSTER OF LITTLE SHALLOTS 
WHEREAS WITH ONIONS YOU JUST GET A BIGGER ONE FROM A SMALL ONE 
SEEMS A BIT STINGY DOESN'T IT 
THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD MORNING DOWN THE ALLOTMENT BUT NOW I'M GONNA GET ON MY BIKE 
GO HOME AND SOW SOME SEEDS 
I CAN SEE THAT THAT JOE SWIFT IS GONNA BE ON THE PHONE 
ALL THE TIME AFTER TELLING HIM MY NUMBER 
RIGHT I'M PUTTING IN HERE A COUPLE OF GEUMS 
THAT I SALVAGED FROM CAROL'S GARDEN TO MAKE SPACE 
FOR MY PLANTS FOR THE SENSES THIS IS A GEUM MARMALADE 
I LOVE ITS PEACHY APRICOT COLOUR 
REALLY GOOD PLANT FOR SPRING WHICH I THINK WILL WORK 
WELL HERE IN THE COTTAGE GARDEN 
I PUT ONE DOWN OVER THERE ONE HERE UNDER THE CRAB 
OF COURSE CAROL'S BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK IN THE COTTAGE GARDEN 
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
I STARTED PLANTING THIS UP ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND I'LL KEEP IT GOING 
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA THIS YEAR 
IS TO INTRODUCE SOME EDIBLE PLANTS BECAUSE ALL COTTAGE GARDENS 
WITH THIS LOVELY JUMBLE OF PRACTICAL BEAUTIFUL AND RECREATIONAL PLANTS 
SO YOU HAD FLOWERS 
FRUIT VEG AND THE HERBS ALL CHEAP VEG ARE IN THE GARDEN 
THERE'S SOME REALLY DECORATIVE VEGETABLES WILL COME IN HERE 
AND WE'LL KEEP THAT TREND GOING BUT OF COURSE KEEP THE FLOWERS AS WELL 
AND LOOK AFTER THEM 
I THINK THESE GLORIOUS ORANGE AND CRIMSON CALENDULAS WILL LOOK JUST PERFECT WITH THIS LATHYRUS ODORATUS 
AND WHENEVER I GET THE OPPORTUNITY I'M GOING TO GO OVER TO SEE JO AND RUSSELL 
WHO ARE JUST STARTING OFF A NEW GARDEN 
THERE'S NOT A LOT GOING ON THERE YET BUT I'M HOPING TO HELP THEM TURN IT INTO A REALLY EVENTFUL 
AND FRUITFUL PLACE 
BUT EARLIER THIS YEAR I WENT OVER TO HELP THEM START A NURSERY BED MUCH LIKE THIS ONE 
AND I TOOK THEM THE VERY BEST PRESENT I COULD POSSIBLY THINK OF 
A LOAD OF MY OWN SPECIAL COMPOST 
NOW UNDERNEATH THIS PLASTIC IS MY MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE 
TADA 
APART FROM THIS SOIL THAT IS AND IT'S JUST READY TO USE 
IT'S LOVELY STUFF 
BUT ALREADY IT'S JUST TOTALLY SCRUMPTIOUS AND READY TO GO 
I'M GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE OF HUGE BUCKETS FULL OF THIS OVER TO RUSSELL AND JO 
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL RESOURCE AND IT'S SOMETHING THEY HAVEN'T GOT YET 
THIS IS JUST THE SORT OF STARTER TO POINT THE WAY AND SHOW THEM WHAT THEY'RE GOING 
TO BE MAKING FOR THEMSELVES IN FUTURE 
NOW ONE OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TO TAKE FOR JO AND RUSSELL 
IS A BIG LUMP OF ONE OF MY FAVOURITE FAVOURITE PLANTS 
IT'S RUDBECKIA FULGIDA DEAMII 
AND I'VE GOT LOADS OF IT ALL OVER THE GARDEN 
IT'S A BIG YELLOW DAISY WITH A BLACK MIDDLE AND IT WILL ATTRACT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS 
OF BENEFICIAL INSECTS SO IT'S AN IDEAL SORT OF STARTER PLANT 
DIVISION'S PROBABLY THE OLDEST FORM OF PROPAGATION 
NOT ONLY ARE YOU INCREASING YOUR OWN STOCK BUT YOU'RE MAKING ALL SORTS OF THINGS 
THAT YOU'D BE ABLE TO SWAP WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY MAKES FOR A SUSTAINABLE GARDEN ISN'T IT 
IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF GOING OUT AND BUYING YOUR GARDEN 
THIS IS A PLANT THAT WILL GIVE MONTHS AND MONTHS OF PLEASURE 
RUDBECKIA'S ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMMODATING AND REWARDING 
OF HERBACEOUS PERENNIALS IT'S A PRAIRIE PLANT 
FLOWERING PROLIFICALLY FROM JULY RIGHT THROUGH TO NOVEMBER 
I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT AND I USE IT AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY 
I'VE GOT THE COMPOST AND THE RUDBECKIA SO AS SOON AS I GET TO JO AND RUSS'S GARDEN 
WE CAN GET TO WORK ON THE NEW NURSERY BED 
HIYA HEY COME ON IN ALL DRESSED UP AND READY FOR WORK 
THE BEST PRESENT I COULD BRING YOU THAT'S COMPOST 
BROUGHT YOU SOME OLD POTS A SMASHING PLANT TO START WITH 
BROAD BEANS GARLIC ALL MANNER OF STUFF 
WONDERFUL AND A FEW TOOLS YES I CAN'T DO THIS ON MY OWN 
I'LL GET IT NO COME ON LET'S DO IT TOGETHER O. K. O. K. 
GO ON JO GO ON THEN 
BEAUTIFUL STUFF 
OOH LOOK AND IT'S GOT WORMS 
OH BLIMEY WAHEY WHOA 
WELL THAT'S IT MONUMENTAL MOMENT 
JO AND RUSSELL WANT TO RECYCLE EVERYTHING THEY CAN 
THIS TURF'LL SOON BREAK DOWN INTO GOOD LOAM TO USE LATER SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE GARDEN 
LOOK FINN IT'S A PLANT 
IT'S CALLED RUDBECKIA FULGIDA DEAMII AND IT'S A NORTH AMERICAN PRAIRIE DAISY 
O. K. SO IT'LL LOVE THIS PLACE LIGHT SOIL ALL THIS LOVELY OPENNESS AND SUNSHINE YEAH 
HAVE YOU DONE THIS BEFORE NO GET YOUR THUMBS STUCK INTO THAT 
ALL YOU NEED IS PULL YEP PULL AND TEASE THEM APART 
THAT'S IT O. K. CAN YOU SEE EACH ONE OF THESE IS GOING TO MAKE A NEW IT'S GOT A NEW LITTLE THING RIGHT 
JO AND RUSS SEEM TO BE REALLY MOTIVATED TO GET THINGS UNDER WAY 
THE PLANTING OF A TREE IS A SYMBOLIC START 
AND I THINK THIS IS GOING TO PROVE TO BE A TRULY EXCITING YEAR FOR ALL THE FAMILY 
AND I'M SURE WE'VE GOT SOME MARVELLOUS TIMES AHEAD IN MY GARDEN AT GLEBE COTTAGE TOO 
EACH WEEK WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT A PEST OR DISEASE 
THIS WEEK I'VE GOT TWO BUT I'LL START WITH THE DISEASE 
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING FOR DAMPING OFF WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF DAMPING OFF HERE IN THE GREENHOUSE 
YOU CAN SEE THAT THESE ESCHSCHOLZIA OR CALIFORNIA POPPY SEEDLINGS 
HAVE GOT A PATCH IN THE MIDDLE WHERE SEEDLINGS HAVE COLLAPSED 
THAT'S WHERE THE FUNGUS WHICH CAUSES DAMPING OFF HAS HAD ITS EFFECT 
BUT THE REST OF THE SEEDLINGS ARE UNAFFECTED AND THEY'LL BE PERFECTLY HEALTHY 
YOU GET DAMPING OFF TYPICALLY ABOUT THIS TIME OF YEAR 
WHEN IT'S MILD IN A GREENHOUSE OR CONSERVATORY WHICH IS VERY DAMP 
ALWAYS GETS SEEDLINGS AT THAT STAGE WHERE THEY'VE GERMINATED 
THEY'VE APPEARED BUT THEY'VE NOT YET BEEN PRICKED OUT 
SO THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO PRICK OUT YOUR SEEDLINGS AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN 
SPACE THEM NICE AND WIDELY BECAUSE VENTILATION AS WITH ANY FUNGUS 
IS ITS ENEMY 
ALSO USE TAP WATER BECAUSE THAT WILL BE FREE OF THE FUNGAL SPORES 
THE OTHER PROBLEM PEOPLE GET AT THIS TIME OF YEAR WHICH JUDGING BY THE LETTERS I GET 
THEY DO FEEL IS A MAJOR DISASTER ARE APHIDS 
BUT THEY ACTUALLY VERY RARELY DO HUGE AMOUNTS OF DAMAGE 
AND THEY ARE BEST CONTROLLED BY NATURAL PREDATORS 
LIKE BEETLES LADYBIRDS OR EVEN BIRDS 
THE BEST WAY TO ENCOURAGE THOSE IS TO HAVE LOTS OF COVER 
THAT CAN BE IN TREES SHRUBS AND HEDGES BUT ALSO TWIGS LEAVES DON'T BE TOO TIDY 
NOW LADYBIRDS ARE LOVED BY EVERYBODY 
HOWEVER THERE IS A NEW LADYBIRD ABOUT 
THAT MAY NOT BE QUITE SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE SPECIMEN 
PL AYS 
OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS 
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF ARTICLES IN THE NEWSPAPERS 
OF THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW INVASIVE INSECT SPECIES TO THE U. K. 
AND ABOUT HOW THIS LADYBIRD IS GOING TO DECIMATE ALL OUR NATIVE SPECIES 
THIS IS HARMONIA AXYRIDIS THE HARLEQUIN OR MULTI COLOURED LADYBIRD 
IT APPEARED IN THE U. K. IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
IT ORIGINATES FROM ASIA 
WHEN THE HARLEQUIN LADYBIRD WAS FIRST OBSERVED IN THE U. K. 
IT SEEMED TO BE CENTRED AROUND SOME OF THE MAIN PORTS 
ON THE SOUTH EASTERN SIDE SO IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE COMING IN ON THINGS IMPORTED TO THE U. K. 
SINCE THEN THEY HAVE SPREAD QUITE RAPIDLY 
WITH THE HARLEQUIN BECAUSE IT IS SUCH AN AGGRESSIVE FEEDER 
WHEN THEY'VE FINISHED EATING THE APHIDS 
THEY WILL TURN TO WHATEVER ELSE IS THERE 
WHICH CAN INVARIABLY BE THE LARVAE 
OF SOME OF OUR NATIVE LADYBIRD SPECIES 
THE HARLEQUIN LADYBIRD LARVAE 
HAVE OFTEN BEEN DESCRIBED AS LITTLE ALLIGATORS 
BECAUSE THEY DO RESEMBLE ALLIGATORS 
THESE WANDER ABOUT THE LEAF 
ATTACKING THE APHIDS AND THEY HOLD THEM IN THEIR MOUTH PARTS 
BITE INTO THEM AND START SUCKING OUT ALL THE JUICES 
PL AYS 
WE HAVE TWO FORMS OF HARLEQUIN IN THE U. K. 
THERE'S A BLACK FORM MELANISTIC FORM 
THAT HAS TWO FOUR OR SIX RED SPOTS ON THEM 
AND WE HAVE A SUCCINIA FORM WHICH IS ORANGE 
WITH A NUMBER OF BLACK SPOTS ON THE BACK 
THIS IS THE FORM PEOPLE WILL OFTEN CONFUSE WITH OUR SEVEN SPOT LADYBIRD SPECIES 
SO ANYTHING THAT HAS MORE THAN SEVEN SPOTS AND IS THE SAME SIZE 
LITTLE BIT LARGER THAN THE SEVEN SPOT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY 
TO BE A HARLEQUIN LADYBIRD 
THE JURY IS STILL OUT ON THESE NEW LADYBIRDS 
SO DON'T GO AROUND SQUASHING THEM FOR TWO REASONS 
ONE BECAUSE IT'S JOLLY DIFFICULT TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR OWN LADYBIRD AND THESE NEW ONES 
ALSO THEY DO EAT APHIDS THEY ARE DOING GOOD AS WELL AS SOME HARM 
SO LET'S ALL JUST OBSERVE THEM AND SEE HOW IT EVOLVES 
SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH PESTS AND DISEASES 
OF EVERY KIND ON HIS ALLOTMENT IS JOE 
AND HE'S AT HIS HOME IN NORTH LONDON BUSILY SOWING SEEDS 
WE'RE BACK IN LIVELY HACKNEY NOW 
THINK THERE'S A PARTY STARTED NEXT DOOR 
GO ON ALL WEEKEND BUT I'M JUST SOWING SOME SEEDS 
IT'S THE PERFECT TIME OF YEAR TO SOW SEEDS THE LIGHT LEVELS ARE UP 
WE DID SOME CHILLIES LAST YEAR AT BERRYFIELDS SO I KNOW HOW TO SOW THOSE 
WE'LL DO SOME CHILLIES ANAHEIM A NICE MILD ONE 
TOMATO GARTENPERLE REALLY NICE LITTLE CHERRY TOMATO 
AND SOME BASIL AND THEY'RE ALL EXACTLY THE SAME WAY OF SOWING THEM 
JUST GOT SOME MULTI PURPOSE NO SORRY SOME PEAT FREE MULTI PURPOSE COMPOST 
AND JUST PUT IT INTO THESE CELLS HERE 
AND 
I'VE GOT THE SEEDS HERE 
CHILLI ANAHEIM 
NOW I'VE WATERED IT FIRST SO THAT I DON'T LOSE A SEED 
AND YOU SORT OF SPLOSH IT AROUND SO IT'S NICE AND MOIST 
SO I'M LITERALLY JUST PLACING ONE IN EACH CELL LIKE THAT 
AND THEN I'M JUST GONNA GET SOME OF THIS VERMICULITE 
YOU COULD JUST SPRINKLE A BIT OF COMPOST OVER THE TOP OF IT 
BUT VERMICULITE IS IDEAL COS IT'S NICE AND LIGHT 
SO THE SEEDLINGS CAN JUST PUSH THEIR WAY THROUGH 
AND I'M GONNA LABEL IT 
CHILLI ANAHEIM THAT GOES IN THERE 
AND THE GREAT THING ABOUT THESE 
THESE READY MADE SORT OF WINDOWSILL TRAYS 
IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE 
A LITTLE CLEAR PLASTIC COVER TO THEM 
BUT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ONE OF THESE 
YOU COULD EASILY JUST PUT IT IN A POT AND SOW IT 
AND COVER IT WITH CLINGFILM UNTIL IT GERMINATES 
AS SOON AS IT'S GERMINATED TAKE THAT OFF 
AND THEN IT'LL START GROWING 
BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T LEAVE THOSE OUTDOORS 
ALL THESE SEEDS HAVE GOTTA GO INDOORS UNTIL THE FROST HAS GONE 
SO I'M GONNA SOW ALL OF THOSE 
BUT ALSO I'VE GOT THIS GREAT SALAD MIX AS WELL 
THIS SORT OF SPICY SALAD MIX WHICH IS REALLY NICE 
AND IT'S A MIXTURE OF DIFFERENT LEAVES WHERE'S IT GONE 
THERE IT IS WHAT'S IT GOT IN IT 
THIS HAS GOT PAK CHOI MIBUNA GREEN MUSTARD MIZUNA 
RED MUSTARD NICE AND SPICY 
AND THE BRILLIANT THING ABOUT THESE IS THEY JUST CUT AND COME AGAIN 
SO YOU CAN GET TWO OR THREE CROPS OUT OF THIS SALAD 
AND IF YOU SOW THEM THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 
YOU GET A NICE CONTINUOUS SUPPLY 
THERE YOU GO YOU GET A LOAD MORE IN HERE 
AGAIN I'VE GOTTA WATER FIRST REMEMBER TO DO THAT 
GET THE COMPOST NICE AND MOIST 
AND THEN I'M JUST GONNA SPRINKLE THESE 
QUITE THINLY IT'S VERY TEMPTING TO GO OVER THE TOP 
O. K. JUST GONNA LABEL THAT ONE UP 
AND THEN A HANDFUL OF VERMICULITE OVER THE TOP 
MAYBE ANOTHER HALF 
AND THEN BECAUSE THIS ONE DOESN'T COME WITH A LID 
I'M USING A BIT OF CLINGFILM 
POP IT OVER THE TOP 
RUBBER BAND TO KEEP IT IN PLACE 
AND THEN AS SOON AS THE SEEDS GERMINATE 
YOU'LL SEE THEM NICE LITTLE GREEN FRESH LEAVES COMING THROUGH 
WHIP THE CLINGFILM OFF AND KEEP IT WATERED 
I'M GONNA SOW ONE OF THEM A WEEK AND WE CAN KEEP THEM IN THE GARDEN HERE 
COS THE KITCHEN'S RIGHT THERE 
JUST CHOP 'EM AND STRAIGHT IN FOR A MEAL 
BUT I WANNA SHOW YOU THESE LOOK AT THESE 
THESE ARE THE POTATOES I'VE BEEN CHITTING OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS 
AND THERE'S THAT DELIBERATION DO YOU CHIT OR NOT 
BUT I TURNED UP SOME OF THESE MAIL ORDER 
SO I HAD TO DO SOMETHING WITH THEM BUT LOOK AT THAT 
BEAUTIFULLY CHITTED REALLY NICE 
AND THERE'S ALSO ONES THAT CLEVE GAVE ME 
I'VE GOT CHARLOTTE AND MAYAN GOLD 
AND THIS ONE'S ROCKET 
AND THEY'RE DOING REALLY NICELY AS WELL 
I'VE GOTTA SHOW YOU THIS ONE 
THIS WAS A BIT OF A DISASTER 
THIS IS SARPO AND TURNED UP MAIL ORDER AND I PUT 'EM IN THE CELLAR 
COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THEM TILL A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO 
AND THEY'VE GONE A BIT CRAZY 
SEARCHING FOR LIGHT I THINK 
BUT WHAT I WANNA DO IS JUST PULL OFF SOME OF THESE LONGER STEMS 
AND YOU'VE GOT SOME NEW BUDS COMING THERE 
AND I'LL CHUCK 'EM IN THE GROUND UP AT THE ALLOTMENT HOPE FOR THE BEST 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
BUT IT'S TAKEN OVER MY LIFE HERE 
SO NEXT WEEK I WANNA GET THEM UP TO THE ALLOTMENT 
GET 'EM IN THE GROUND 
NOW IF THERE'S JUST ONE THING YOU DO THIS WEEKEND 
I RECOMMEND YOU GET YOURSELF ORGANISED FOR THE CHANCE OF FURTHER COLD WEATHER 
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE'S CLIMATE CHANGE 
AND LAST APRIL FOR EXAMPLE WAS THE WARMEST SINCE RECORDS BEGAN 
THAT'S ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NINE 
JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKENDS AGO 
WE HAD THE MOST WIDESPREAD SNOWFALL IN APRIL FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS 
IN FACT WE HAD SOME PICTURES FROM SOME OF YOU 
SO FOR EXAMPLE IN LONDON SHIRLEY ISAACS SENT US PICTURES 
OF QUITE HEAVY SNOW AND IN THE MIDLANDS AND WALSALL 
TONY AND MARIE NEWTON SENT US PICTURES OF CAMELLIAS 
IN FULL FLOWER ALMOST GROANING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF SNOW 
AND THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT CLIMATE CHANGE OR NOT 
YOU CAN STILL GET FROST DAMAGE WELL INTO MAY 
HERE WE HAVE A MAGNOLIA STELLATA 
LAST WEEK THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY UNBLEMISHED 
AND HERE WE HAVE IT BURNT BY FROST 
NOW THE BEST THING TO DO 
IS JUST SIMPLY EITHER TO GO OUT AND BUY OR HAVE TO HAND SOME FLEECE 
IF THERE'S FROST FORECAST OR IF YOU GO OUTSIDE AND YOU FEEL THE AIR 
TRUST YOUR OWN JUDGMENT 
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST DRAPE IT OVER LIKE THIS 
AND THAT'S ENOUGH THAT'S ENOUGH TO STOP ANY DAMAGE 
AND IN THE MORNING JUST LET THE SUN COME UP 
AND AS SOON AS THE AIR'S WARMED UP USUALLY BY ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK 
YOU TAKE IT OFF AND THE FLOWERS WILL BE UNTOUCHED 
AND IF ONLY WE HAD DONE THIS OURSELVES A FEW DAYS AGO 
I WAS GOING TO SOW THESE SEEDS DIRECT IN MY GARDEN FOR THE SENSES 
THESE ARE SOME MARIGOLDS AND POPPIES 
BUT I'VE BEEN DODGING SHOWERS ALL DAY 
THE GROUND IS GETTING FAIRLY WET SO I'VE DECIDED TO SOW THEM INDOORS 
WHICH THE POPPIES WON'T LIKE COS THEY DON'T TRANSPLANT WELL 
BUT THE CALENDULA I CAN DO 
THE REASON I'M SOWING THEM IS FOR COLOUR AND OBVIOUSLY 
THAT'S TO DO WITH SIGHT THAT ASPECT OF THE SENSES 
AND I'M AWARE THAT EVERYTHING YOU CAN SEE IN THE GARDEN 
IS TO DO WITH SIGHT 
BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IN THIS PARTICULAR GARDEN 
IS TO FOCUS ON HOW THE SENSES WORK 
AND HOW WE CAN MANIPULATE THEM IN THE GARDEN 
TO MAXIMISE THEM 
WITH COLOUR ALONE FOR EXAMPLE 
THESE CALENDULA ARE AN ORANGEY YELLOW 
NOW IF I PUT THEM NEXT TO A BLUE OR A PURPLE 
THE PURPLE AND THE YELLOW WILL SEEM MUCH MUCH STRONGER 
ORANGE AND BLUE ARE OPPOSITES 
AND ANY OPPOSITE COLOUR LIKE RED AND GREEN 
YOU'LL INTENSIFY THE OTHER COLOUR 
ON THE OTHER HAND IF I PUT THEM NEXT TO A RED OR A PURE YELLOW 
THEY'LL SPREAD THE COLOUR SO YOU GET A MASSED EFFECT 
LIKE WE'VE GOT IN THE HOT END OF THE BORDER IN THE LONG BORDERS 
NOW WHAT I'VE GOT HERE 
IS CALENDULA OFFICINALIS RADIO 
WHICH IS A REALLY GOOD ORANGEY DOUBLE MARIGOLD 
SO I WILL PLANT THIS INTO PLUGS 
AND WHEN YOU'RE GOING INTO PLUGS WITH ANNUALS 
WHICH COULD JUST AS WELL BE PLANTED OUTSIDE 
JUST GET THEM GOING IN THE GREENHOUSE OR COLD FRAME 
AND THEN HARDEN THEM OFF AND THEN PLANT OUT THE WHOLE PLUG 
AND JUST A PINCH IN EACH PLUG 
TWO OR THREE I'M NOT GONNA COUNT THEM 
I CAN THIN THEM OUT LATER IF I FEEL THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY 
BUT I WON'T WORRY IF I'VE GOT A LITTLE CLUMP 
AND I'M ALREADY THINKING WELL 
DO I WANT TO CONTRAST THEM WITH A PURPLE OR A BLUE 
OR DO I WANT TO CREATE A SORT OF FIERY EFFECT 
AND THINK IN TERMS OF YELLOWS AND REDS TO GO WITH THEM 
THE COLOUR THAT WON'T LOOK GOOD WITH THEM 
IS PINK IN ANY FORM OR EVEN WHITES 
SO I'LL HAVE THOSE IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE GARDEN 
NOW THOSE ARE ON THERE AND I'VE GOT A LITTLE SIEVE HERE 
AND I CAN JUST COVER THEM UP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SOIL 
BY THE WAY A LITTLE SIEVE WHEN YOU'RE SEWING SEEDS IS INVALUABLE 
AND ALL THAT LUMPY STUFF 
AND OBVIOUSLY WATER THEM WELL AND LABEL THEM 
I'LL DO A FEW TRAYS LIKE THIS AND THEY CAN GO INTO THE GARDEN 
POPPIES WILL BE DONE WHEN WE GET A PROPERLY DRY DAY 
NOW THIS IS ALL ABOUT PLANTS 
BUT THERE'S A RAILWAY STATION CHARLBURY IN THE COTSWOLDS 
WHERE A GROUP OF FRIENDS HAVE GOT TOGETHER TO MAINTAIN IT 
AND RATHER THAN JUST BEING ABOUT HORTICULTURE AND PLANTS 
THAT GARDEN IS REALLY JUST AS MUCH ABOUT PEOPLE 
THE HISTORY OF THE STATION IS ACTUALLY REALLY QUITE FASCINATING 
CERTAINLY IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
IT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN STOPPING OFF POINTS FOR COAL AND WATER 
WE'RE ON THE PADDINGTON HEREFORD WORCESTER LINE HERE 
IT HAD SIDINGS AND BRIDGES IT HAD ANOTHER PLATFORM OVER THERE 
AND THEN WE JUMP FORWARD TO THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
AND BEECHING CAME ALONG AND STARTED CUTTING TRACKS 
AND THEY REDUCED OUR TRACK TO ONE SINGLE LINE 
BUT THEN EVEN LATER THEY WANTED TO CUT THE LINE ALTOGETHER 
WITHOUT NOTICING THAT THE CHAIRMAN OF BRITISH RAIL AT THE TIME 
SIR PETER PARKER LIVED JUST OVER THERE 
AND HE WAS USING THIS STATION REGULARLY 
SO THEY THOUGHT NOT SUCH A GOOD IDEA 
AND THEN JOHN COX THE RETIRING STATIONMASTER SIX YEARS AGO SAID 
I'M RETIRING I'VE BEEN LOOKING AFTER THE GARDEN 
I DON'T KNOW WHO'LL LOOK AFTER IT I SAID I WILL 
SO WE GOT ANDREW IN AND OTHER CHUMS 
AND THE OTHER IMPORTANT CHUM WAS SIR PETER PARKER HIMSELF 
INDEED HE CAME ALONG WITH HIS GARDEN TOOLS IN THE BACK OF HIS BENTLEY 
AND HE'D DO A BIT NOW AND THEN 
REALLY EVER SINCE THEN ALL WE'VE DONE IS TO PLANT SURPLUS PLANTS 
FROM OUR OWN GARDENS NO CONCESSION TO COLOUR 
JUST AS A NICE WELCOME FOR PEOPLE COMING FROM LONDON 
THEY WALK OUT OF THE TRAIN AND THEY SEE A BIT OF THE COUNTRY 
A NICE COTTAGE GARDEN 
NOT PRETENDING TO BE ANYTHING ELSE BUT 
THERE'S A NICE LITTLE WATER GARDEN UP THERE WITH GOLDFISH 
WE'VE IMPROVED THAT WE'VE PUT GRAVEL OVER THE CRAZY PAVING 
ENLARGED THE POND PLANTED A FEW ARCHITECTURAL PLANTS IN THERE 
BUT THE MAIN POINT OF IT IS WE REALLY LOVE COMING HERE 
IT'S A BIG SOCIAL THERE ARE FOUR OF US 
WE CATCH UP ON THE GOSSIP ABOUT ONCE A MONTH THAT'S IT 
MORNING GENTS 
MORNING HUGH MORNING MORNING 
HOW ARE WE VERY WELL 
I'M A LITTLE LATE I'M A LITTLE LATE NEVER MIND 
I'VE BEEN WORKING DOWN HERE I THINK ABOUT SIX YEARS NOW 
I WAS HONOURED TO BE SIR PETER PARKER'S REPLACEMENT 
AFTER HE PASSED AWAY 
IT'S FANTASTIC TO GET DOWN HERE AND HAVE A BIT OF MAN TIME 
WITH RODDY AND THE TEAM 
YOU KNOW LOTS OF OLD STORIES THIS IS MY BIT OF COMMUNITY SERVICE 
FOR A LIVING I'M A FULL TIME GARDENER 
AND THIS IS PARTLY WHY I THINK I'VE BEEN GRABBED 
I HAVE THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY NEED 
WHEN THEY'VE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING AND I ENJOY THE COMPANY 
WELL 
WE DON'T ALWAYS SEE EYE TO EYE ON THE CHOICE OF PLANTS DO WE 
NO WE HAVE QUITE HEATED DEBATES 
BECAUSE I'M A GRASSES FELLA AND A TALL PERENNIALS 
RODDY'S QUITE A SHRUB MAN I'D SAY 
BUT OUR MIXED OPINIONS DO RESULT AS YOU CAN SEE 
WELL I'M THRILLED WITH IT A NICE GARDEN 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE A GOOD BORDER ALL YEAR ROUND 
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE WHICH IS WHY YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRY 
AND CATER FOR EVERY SEASON 
BUT I'M A GREAT BELIEVER IN PLANTING STUFF FOR LATE SUMMER 
AND HERE WE ARE IN SEPTEMBER AND LOOK IT'S A RIOT OF COLOUR 
SO IT'S SORT OF WORKED 
ALONG WITH ANDREW'S GRASSES I MEAN THIS IS A SORT OF 
MUTUAL TRIUMPH YOU MIGHT SAY 
BUT IT'S JUST A WONDERFULLY EVOCATIVE PLACE TO BE 
IT'S A VERY SPECIAL PLACE TO BE 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE PLATFORM FILLING UP 
AND THEN YOU HEAR THE NOISE OF THIS GREAT BREATHING MONSTER 
YOU'RE NOT REALLY AWARE OF IT 
THE NEXT MINUTE EVERYONE'S GONE 
IT BREATHES AGAIN AND THE PLATFORM'S EMPTY 
MAGIC MAGIC PLACE TO BE 
HERE GOES 
HERE GOES 
I LOVE THE WAY THAT TULIPS COME IN WITH THIS BLAZE OF PURE COLOUR 
HERE IN THE LONG BORDERS WE'VE PLANTED MASSES 
THAT ARE BEGINNING TO COME THROUGH 
IN FACT THIS YEAR WITH IT BEING A COLD APRIL THEY'RE LATE 
THEY'RE SLOW TO COME BUT IT'S FINE 
THEY'LL LAST LONGER AND GO ON WELL INTO MAY 
IT DOES MEAN THAT IT'S A TURNING 
A POINT OF THE YEAR FROM WHICH THERE'S NO WAY BACK 
COLOUR ALL THE WAY FROM NOW ON IN 
WELL THAT'S THE END OF TODAY'S PROGRAMME 
AND I SHALL BE AWAY FOR A WHILE 
BUT CAROL WILL BE COVERING FOR ME HERE AT BERRYFIELDS 
WHERE SHE'LL BE WORKING IN THE COTTAGE GARDEN AND THE NECTAR BAR 
AS WELL AS DOWN AT GLEBE COTTAGE ON HER OWN GARDEN WORKING ON THE POND 
AND JOE WILL BE BACK ON HIS ALLOTMENT 
THIS TIME WITH HIS CHILDREN 
I'LL SEE YOU BACK HERE AT BERRYFIELDS 
IN ABOUT SIX WEEKS' TIME WHEN I RETURN 
UNTIL THEN BYE BYE
