THEY LIVE ABOVE THE PUB WHERE THEIR 
MUM SANDRA AND THEIR PARTNER ALAN 
ARE LANDLORDS 
IT WAS IN THE COUNTRY AT THE SIDE 
OF A RIVER 
A LOVELY ENVIRONMENT TO BRING 
CHILDREN UP IN

FRIENDLY OUTGOING YOUNG MAN HE 
LOVED IT 
CRAIG'S CHILDHOOD AMBITION IS

PLACE ON AN R. A. F. TRAINING COURSE 
I CAN REMEMBER HAVING SOMETHING TO 
EAT AND THEY USED TO RING AND 
WRITE AND STUFF HE SEEMED TO BE

HE WOULD BE PUTTING ONE HUNDRED PER CENT IN HE 
WOULD WANT TO PROVE THAT HE COULD 
DO IT 
JUST FOUR WEEKS INTO THE TRAINING 
CRAIG HAS AN ACCIDENT 
THEY WAITED FOR HIS HEEL TO GET 
HEALED THEY PUT HIM BACK INTO THE 
TRAINING BUT HIS FOOT BROKE AGAIN 
HE HAD TO COME OUT OF THE R. A. F. 
CRAIG RECUPERATES AT THE FAMILY PUB 
BUT SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT 
HE WAS SPENDING AN AWFUL LOT OF 
POCKET MONEY SPARE CASH AND HE WAS 
PUTTING IT IN FRUIT MACHINES 
HE LOOKED AT IT AS CHALLENGE HE

SOON TURNS INTO AN OBSESSION 
IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT CRAIG'S MUM SANDRA 
MARRIES ALAN 
CRAIG SEEMS CONFIDENT AND RELAXED 
BUT BEHIND THE SCENES IT'S A VERY 
DIFFERENT STORY 
WE NOTICED A CHANGE IN CRAIG HE 
BECAME MORE INTROVERTED 
WE REALISED HE HAD A PROBLEM 
CRAIG'S PLAYING THE SLOT MACHINES 
FOR HOURS EACH DAY 
THE MORE HE PLAYED THEM THE MORE 
HE GUN TO LIKE THEM

OBSESSED WITH FRUIT MACHINES

TO FACE UP TO THINGS 
CRAIG FINALLY ADMITTED THAT HE HAD

AGAIN SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF CONGO HAS BEEN 
DEVASTATED BY CIVIL WAR RIVAL 
FACTIONS HAVE TORN THE COUNTRY 
APART SEPARATING HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
MANY LIKE STUDENT MIKE KILONDA 
SEE THEIR FAMILIES DESTROYED 
AFTER ORGANISING POLITICAL 
DEMONSTRATIONS MIKE BECOMES A 
GOVERNMENT TARGET THE SITUATION 
GETS SO BAD HE'S FORCED TO FLEE THE 
COUNTRY WITH HIS YOUNG SON LEAVING 
HIS PREGNANT WIFE BEHIND 
MIKE IS GRANTED ASYLUM AND ARRIVED 
IN MANCHESTER IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND SIX IT'S 
HERE THAT HE GETS IN TOUCH WITH THE 
RED CROSS ABOUT TRYING TO FIND OUT 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HIS WIFE 
FRANK HIGGINS OF THE RED CROSS'S 
NAL TRACING SERVICE BECOMES MIKE'S 
CASE WORKER HIS EXPERIENCE HAS 
TOLD HIM THAT FINDING HER WON'T BE 
EASY EASY IN SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS AN 
ONGOING CONFLICT THERE ARE CERTAIN 
AREAS THAT ARE NOT AS EASY FOR US 
TO REACH THERE ARE AREAS THAT ARE 
OUT OF BOUNDS AND OFF LIMITS 
BECAUSE THE FIGHTING IS TOO INTENSE 
OR IT'S TOO DANGEROUS FOR THE LOCAL 
RED CROSS MEMBERS OR THE 
INTERNATIONAL DELEGATES 
NO ONE CAN EVEN BE SURE IF MIKE'S 
WIFE FIFI IS STILL ALIVE WITH A 
YOUNG SON TO LOOK AFTER HE HAS TO 
PREPARE HIMSELF FOR THE WORST 
MONTHS LATER THERE'S A LEAD BUT 
IT'S NOT FROM THE CONGO 
MIKE CAME ON ONE OF HIS FOLLOW UP 
VISITS HE HAD RECEIVED INFORMATION 
FROM SOMEONE WHO THINKS THEY HAD 
SEEN HIS WIFE IN LONDON AT A PARTY 
THE WOMAN IS ALSO SEEN ATTENDING A 
CHURCH SERVICE IN LONDON THE RED 
CROSS MAKE INQUIRIES AND FOUR 
MONTHS LATER MIKE RECEIVES A CALL 
IT WAS FANTASTIC 
FIFI HAS ALSO BEEN GRANTED ASYLUM 
SHE'S MUCH NEARER THAN ANYONE 
REALISES REALISES HE ACTUALLY TRACKED HIS WIFE TO 
CARDIFF SHE HAD BEEN IN THE U. K. FOR 
SEVERAL MONTHS AND MIKE HAS BEEN IN 
THE U. K. FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NEITHER 
HAD KNOWN THAT EACH OTHER WAS ALIVE 
AND WELL AND LIVING IN THE U. K. FIFI FIFI HAS EXTRA SPECIAL NEWS FOR MIKE 
MIKE'S PRAYERS ARE ANSWERED HIS 
FAMILY IS REUNITED HE ALSO GETS TO 
MEET HIS YOUNG SON BLESSING FOR THE 
VERY FIRST TIME 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
TIRED EH A GOOD BABY YOU O. K. 
WITH ME NOW IS T. V. PRESENTER KONNIE 
HUQ KONNIE IS AN AMBASSADOR FOR 
THE BRITISH RED CROSS THAT MUST BE 
ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE NOT 
KNOWING IF YOU WILL EVER SEE YOUR 
FAMILY AGAIN 
ABSOLUTELY SEEING 
YOUR FAMILY IS SOMETHING THAT WE 
TAKE FOR GRANTED OVER HERE IN A 
CONFLICT ZONE IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE 
AS THAT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF 
FAMILIES HAVE BEEN TORN APART IN 
THE CONGO THEY'VE HAD CIVIL WAR 
FOR TEN YEARS BASICALLY THERE IS 
TWENTY FIVE FIGHTING FACTIONS YES SO IT'S 
A REALLY DESPERATE SITUATION YOU 
KNOW YOU CAN LITERALLY COME HOME 
ONE DAY AND YOUR FAMILY ARE GONE 
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THAT MUST BE 
LIKE AND NOT KNOWING WHETHER 
THEY'RE ALIVE OR WHETHER THEY ARE 
DEAD OR WHETHER YOU WILL SEE THEM 
AGAIN PEOPLE CAN BE SEPARATED FOR 
YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE 
THEY'RE REUNITED 
MIKE'S STORY IS NOT UNIQUE 
ABSOLUTELY MIKE HIS STORY IS VERY 
UNIQUE IN THAT THE CHANCES OF HIS 
WIFE HAVING ASYLUM AND BEING IN THE 
SAME COUNTRY AS HIP I MEAN THAT IS 
ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE THE CONGO 
IS THE THIRD BIGGEST COUNTRY IN 
AFRICA SO IT IS MASSIVE AND IF YOU 
CAN THINK OF THE FACT DURING 
CONFLICT COMMUNICATIONS ARE VERY 
POOR AND AS COMMUNICATIONS AREN'T 
UP TO THE STANDARD OF SOMEWHERE 
OVER HERE IF YOU LOSE A LOVED ONE 
IT IS A DESPERATE SITUATION YOU 
DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU WILL EVER 
FIND THEM AGAIN 
SO WHAT CAN THE 
RED CROSS DO TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE 
MIKE IN THAT SITUATION 
WELL WAY 
BASICALLY THE RED CROSS HAVE 
OFFICES IN EVERY COUNTRY THAT THEY 
OPERATE IN AND SO MIKE COULD GO 
TO HIS LOCAL RED CROSS OFFICE HERE 
AND THEN THEY CAN COMMUNICATE WITH 
THE RED CROSS OFFICE THAT IS 
RELEVANT IN THE CONGO AND THE GOOD 
THING ABOUT THE RED CROSS IS IT 
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT RELIGION YOU 
ARE WHICH SIDE OF THE CONFLICT YOU 
ARE ON THEY TRANSCEND THAT SO THEY 
CAN CROSS FACTION LINES FIGHTING 
FACTION LINES AND WHEN YOU THINK 
THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE OVER THERE IN THE 
CONGO THAT IS A BIG DEAL THAT IS 
A BIG NUMBER YES I MEAN I DID 
WORK WITH THE RED CROSS IN ANGOLA 
WHERE THEY HAVE HAD THIRTY YEARS OF 
CIVIL WAR AND EVERY SINGLE FAMILY 
HAS AT LEAST ONE PERSON MISSING L. 
SAW A REEWE REUNIFICATION THAT IS 
AMAZING GOING BACK TO THE CONGO 
THERE IS FIVE TO FOUR MILLION PEOPLE THAT 
HAVE DIED AS A RESULT OF THE 
CONFLICT THERE 
THAT IS MORE THAN 
THE POPULATION OF NEW ZEALAND IT IT IS CONTRACRAZY THE DEATH COUNT IS 
THE BIGGEST SINCE THE SECOND WORLD 
WAR 
THEY HAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE WAR THEY ARE DOING FANTASTIC WORK AND 
THERE IS A MESSAGING SERVICE HOW 
DOES IT WORK 
THE TRACING AND 
MESSAGES SERVICE SO THAT IS HOW 
THE RED CROSS CAME ABOUT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY NINE 
THE VERY FIRST MESSAGE WAS PASSED 
ON AFTER A BATTLE THAT IS HOW THE 
RED CROSS CAME ABOUT HE SAW DURING 
CONFLICT THERE IS NO WAY THERE WAS 
A SOLDIER DYING AND HE WANTED TO 
LET HIS FAMILY KNOW WHAT HAS P. 
HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THERE IS 
NOTHING WORSE THAN NOT KNOWING THAT 
WAS THE FIRST ME SAP SADGE THAT GOT 
PASSED ACROSS SINCE THEN IT HAS 
TURNED INTO A MASSIVE ORGANISATION 
OPERATING MESSAGE 
THE RED CROSS 
ARE HELPING PEOPLE WORLDWIDE FROM 
ALL ROUND THE WORLD BUT PEOPLE FROM 
THAT ARE MISSING LOVED ONES FROM 
WORLD WAR TWO 
YES THAT IS THE THING 
AS I WAS SAYING YOU CAN BE 
SEPARATED FOR YEARS AND THE NOT 
KNOWING PEOPLE WANT CLOSURE YOU 
KNOW 
SO SOMETHING FROM THEN TWENTY PER CENT KNOW OF THE RED CROSS'S WORK IS COMING 
FROM WORLD WAR TWO AND WE HAVE SHOWN 
SOME REUNITED ON THE PROGRAMME SO

THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE HAD BEEN 
OUT WITH THESE YOUNG LADS THEY 
STAYED OUT THEY HAD GONE BACK TO 
ONE OF THEIR HOUSES BY MID MORNING 
STARTED TO THINK WELL STRANGE 
THAT HE HAS NOT RANG 
AT THE END OF 
THE DAY WHEN THERE IS STILL NO WORD 
FROM CRAIG HIS MUM BEGINS TO PANIC PANIC 
THE SUNDAY AND THE MONDAY PANIC WE WERE ABSOLUTELY IN TURMOIL ON 
THE TUESDAY MORNING I WENT TO THE 
POLICE 
NO ONE HAS SEEN HIM FOR POLICE THREE DAYS CLEVELAND POLICE LAUNCH 
AN INVESTIGATION WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
IN THE HOURS LEADING UP TO HIS 
DISAPPEARANCE 
CRAIG AND HIS FRIEND DISAPPEARANCE GOT A TAXI FROM THE CENTRE OF

CLOCK ON THE FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
TRAVELLED TO MIDDLESBROUGH TOWN 
CENTRE 
AT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THE GROUP OF CENTRE FRIEND ARRIVE AT THE CORNER HOUSE 
THE PUB HAS A DISCO AND IT IS 
PACKED CORNERHOUSE BUT FOR ONE 
PERSON THERE ARE OTHER 
DISTRACTIONS 
CRAIG SPENT SOME DISTRACTIONS CONSIDERABLE TIME PLAYING THE FRUIT 
MACHINES ON THE PREMISES 
THE CLUB 
DOORMAN REMEMBERS HIM LEAVING AT 
ONE POINT FIVE OH IN THE MORNING HE IS ALONE 
CRAIG WAS SEEN TO BE JUST STOOD 
MORE OR LESS DIRECTLY OUTSIDE THE 
CORNERHOUSE PUB HE WAS STOOD SO WE 
DON'T KNOW WHAT DIRECTION HE LEFT 
IN 
SO WHERE DOES CRAIG GO WHEN HE IN LEAVES THE CORNERHOUSE THE NEXT 
DAY TEAMS OF SPECIALIST OFFICERS 
ARE CALLED IN 
EVERYWHERE ROUND 
THIS AREA HAS BEEN SEARCHED ALL 
THE MAIN STREET AS YOU GO ALONG 
ANY ALLEYS TO SEE IF CRAIG HAD BEEN 
LAIN INJURED ANY WHERE 
FOR THROW 
DAYS OFFICERS SEARCHED THE CENTRE 
OF MIDDLESBROUGH THEY MAKE DOOR TO 
DOOR TO DOOR INQUIRIES BUT THERE 
IS NO TRACE OF CRAIG 
STILL TO COME THERE IS NEWS OF A 
SIGHTING OVER ONE HUNDRED MILES AWAY IN 
LANCASHIRE 
A LADY IN ROCHDALE CAME LANCASHIRE FORWARD BELIEVING SHE HAD SIGHTED 
CRAIG 
IN THE SEARCH FOR HER SON CRAIG CRAIG'S MUM MAKES AN AGONISING 
JOURNEY 
THEY ASKED ME WOULD I BE JOURNEY PREPARED TO GO WITH THEM TO 
ROCHDALE AND THEY WOULD CHECK THIS 
SIGHTING OUT 
D. S. CIING PENDLINGTON 
HAS BEEN WORKING ON CHRIS'S CASE 
CRAIG'S CASE 
CRAIG WAS LAST SEEN 
AT THE PUB IN MIDDLESBROUGH ON THE 
EARLY HOURS THE TWENTY SECOND FEBRUARY OF 
TWO THOUSAND THREE AND BECAUSE THAT WAS THE LAST 
SIGHTING OF HIM THE FOCUS OF THE 
INVESTIGATION WANTED TO MAKE SURE 
CRAIG WASN'T LAIN INJURED ANY WHERE 
SO IT WAS SEARCHED BY A SPECIALIST 
SEARCH TEAM TO ENSURE HE WASN'T 
LAID INJURED ANY WHERE 
THAT IS NOT 
WHERE HE IS FROM HE IS FROM TWENTY 
MILES OUTSIDE IT IS A VERY BUSY 
AREA AT THE TIME HE WAS OUT 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SO DID YOU DO 
C. C. T. V. INQUIRIES DOWN THERE YES YES OFFICERS WERE TASKED TO REVIEW THE 
C. C. T. V. FOR MIDDLESBROUGH AT THAT 
TIME AND BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF 
IT AT THE TIME THEY WEREN'T 
PARTICULARLY ABLE TO IDENTIFY CRAIG 
AT ALL FROM THE GENERAL PEOPLE 
WALKING ROUND IF THAT MIDDLESBROUGH 
AREA 
I MEAN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AREA A MASSIVE JOB TAKING C. C. T. V. AND 
IDENTIFYING ONE PERSON FROM 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
YOU SAY THAT IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY 
GOOD THEN HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED TO 
THE FOOTAGE 
NO THE FOOTAGE YOU 
HAVE IS THE FOOTAGE YOU HAVE YOU 
CAN'T DO ANYTHING WHERE IT 
SO IT 
CAN'T BE ENHANCED CRAIG'S CASE HAS 
BEEN ON HERE BRIEFLY HAVE YOU HAD 
ANY LEADS 
WE HAD TWO PEOPLE COME 
FORWARD WITH INFORMATION AND THAT 
IS UNDER INVESTIGATION AS WE SPEAK 
NOW 
BRILLIANT WE HOPE LAY LEAD TO NOW SOMETHING SOMETHING INTERESTING WE 
HAVE SEEN IS SANDRA WAS TAKEN TO 
ROCHDALE BUT SOME OF YOUR OFFICER 
IS THAT WHAT YOU ORDINARILY DO IT IT DEPEND ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE IN 
THOSE CRAIG THE FACT HE WAS 
MISSING WAS ADVERTISED ON MILK 
CARTONS AND THE PERSON CAME FORWARD 
TO SAY THEY PERHAPS HAD SEEN CRAIG 
SO THE DECISION WAS TAKE INTO TAKE 
SANDRA ACROSS TO ROCHDALE AND 
OBVIOUSLY POSITIVELY IDENTIFY AND 
UNFORTUNATELY IT WASN'T CRAIG THAT THAT IS UNFORTUNATE WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND 
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS IN THIS 
CASE 
THE BIGGEST THING IS THE FACT CASE THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO INFORMATION 
AT ALL CRAIG WAS LAST SEEN STOOD 
AT THE STREET CASH FOR HONOURSER 
AND HE DISAPPEARED THERE HAS BEEN 
NOTHING TO SUGGEST HE MAY HAVE BEEN 
ANY WHERE ELSE AND THAT IS VERY 
UNUSUAL NORMALLY YOU GET BITS OF 
INFORMATION BUT IN THIS CASE 
NOTHING 
SO WHAT NEXT HOPEFULLY NOTHING HOPEFULLY TODAY SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE WILL HAVE 
SOME INFORMATION AND I WOULD APPEAL 
THAT THEY COME TO WARD WITH IT AND 
GIVE SOME CLOSURE TO CRAIG'S FAMILY 
AS TO WHAT HAS GONE ON 
VERY BEST 
OF LUCK WITH THE APPEAL AND I HOPE 
THE CALLS COME IN IF YOU KNOW 
ANYBODY ABOUT WHERE CRAIG COULD BE
