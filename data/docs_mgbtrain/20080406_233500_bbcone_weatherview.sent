WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT TO IMAGE FROM THE EARTH 
IF PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE OUR IMAGES 
AND LOOK FOR OBJECTS THAT HAVEN'T PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEEN 
THEN THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY THERE 
SOMETHING INTERESTS ME PARTICULARLY VULCANOID ASTEROIDS 
ASTEROIDS SOMEWHERE NEAR MERCURY 
NO VULCANOIDS HAVE BEEN FOUND BUT THEY COULD EXIST 
WE CERTAINLY SEE MERCURY IN OUR FIELD OF VIEW 
IF THESE ASTEROIDS EXIST AND ARE OF A SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE 
WE WILL SEE THEM 
LET US ANNOUNCE A SKY AT NIGHT MEDAL 
TO BE WON BY THE FIRST MAN OR WOMAN WHO DISCOVERS A VULCANOID ASTEROID 
SOUNDS LIKE A VERY EXCITING CHALLENGE ABSOLUTELY 
I THINK VERY EXCITING YEARS LIE AHEAD 
TIM CHRIS THANK YOU SO MUCH
