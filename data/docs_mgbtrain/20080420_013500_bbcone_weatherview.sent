THE BIGGEST NAMES IN BRITISH T. V. GO HEAD TO HEAD 
HELLO SATURDAY WAS A DULL DAY IN MOST OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
A LITTLE BIT OF BRIGHTNESS IN THE WEST OF SCOTLAND 
THE NEW DAY WILL FEEL GENERALLY LESS COLD NOT DIFFICULT I KNOW 
TEMPERATURES SHOWING SIGNS OF RECOVERING 
THIS GREAT HOOP OF CLOUD STRETCHING ALL AWAY FROM THE ATLANTIC 
ACROSS THE HEART OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
JUST ABOUT THICK ENOUGH FOR THE ODD BIT OF RAIN TO STAGGER ITS WAY 
THROUGH THE MIDLANDS INTO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND THE NORTH OF WALES 
SKIES STILL RELATIVELY CLEAR ACROSS THE HEART OF SCOTLAND 
AND MAYBE A TOUCH OF FROST EARLY IN THE DAY 
IN WALES TOO MUCH CLOUD AROUND AND THICK ENOUGH 
FOR RAIN ACROSS THE FAR NORTH 
MAY FLIRT WITH THE SOUTH OF NORTHERN IRELAND BUT FURTHER NORTH 
A BRIGHT START 
SO TOO IN WEST SCOTLAND 
FURTHER NORTH AND EAST MORE CLOUD WHICH WILL TAKE TIME TO BREAK UP 
SOUTH OF THE BORDER WE PICK UP ON THAT CLOUDY THEME AGAIN 
SOME RAIN MAY PLAGUE THE PENNINES AND THE NORTH SEA COAST 
MAYBE JUST DOWN TO EAST ANGLIA 
SOUTH OF THAT A DULL START TO THE DAY MURKY IN SOME PLACES 
NOT QUITE FOG FOR THE MOST PART BUT A MURKY START TO THE DAY 
AND THAT'S THE WAY OF IT ACROSS THE MOORS AND SALISBURY PLAIN TOO 
THINGS WILL START TO BRIGHTEN UP ACROSS THESE SOUTHERN COUNTIES 
EVENTUALLY THE SUN MAY WELL BREAK THROUGH 
AND TEMPERATURES WILL RECOVER 
FURTHER NORTH A MUCH SLOWER PROCESS COS YOU'RE STILL STUCK 
WITH THE REMNANTS OF THE OLD FRONT YOU SAW ON THE SATELLITE 
UP IN SCOTLAND IT MAY WELL BE THAT THE EASTERN SIDE JOINS THE WEST 
WITH BRIGHTER PROSPECTS FOR THE AFTERNOON 
ELEVEN OR TWELVE DEGREES IS POSSIBLE AND AGAIN 
THAT NORTH SLASH SOUTH SPLIT IN NORTHERN IRELAND CLOUDY IN THE SOUTH 
CLOUD AND RAIN IN NORTH WALES YET AGAIN A RATHER DULL DAY THERE 
BUT HERE'S THE RATHER DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE AFTERNOON 
ACROSS THE SOUTH THERE'S BRIGHTER SKIES WITH TEMPERATURES ROCKETING 
TO POSSIBLY EVEN FIFTEEN DEGREES IN SOME PLACES 
IT WILL INDUCE A NUMBER OF SHOWERS 
SHOWERS MAY MERGE TOGETHER TO GIVE A LONGER SPELL OF RAIN 
MOVING OUT OF THE SOUTH EAST TOWARDS THE MIDLANDS 
AND TOWARDS EAST WALES INTO A MILD NIGHT 
A RATHER WET DAY FOR A GOOD MANY PARTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
SAVE PERHAPS THE FAR NORTH AND THE FAR SOUTH WEST 
SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER AND DRIER 
LATER IN THE WEEK THINGS VERY UNSETTLED 
BUT IT'S GOODBYE TO SINGLE FIGURE TEMPERATURES 
AS THEY PUSH AWAY TO THE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN DEGREE MARK 
AND WE SAY HELLO SOUTH WESTERLIES AND GOODBYE COLD EASTERLIES
