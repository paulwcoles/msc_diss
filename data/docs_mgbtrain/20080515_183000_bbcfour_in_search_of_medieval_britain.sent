THIS IS THE GOUGH MAP ONE OF THE OLDEST SURVIVING MAPS OF BRITAIN 
DRAWN ON SHEEPSKIN IT'S OVER SIX HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
NO ONE KNOWS WHO MADE IT OR WHY 
BUT IT OFFERS A UNIQUE WINDOW 
ONTO LIFE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE MIDDLE AGES 
IN THIS SERIES I'LL BE USING IT 
TO TRAVEL THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF BRITAIN 
TODAY THE GOUGH MAP IS TAKING ME TO SOUTH WEST ENGLAND 
I'LL FIND OUT WHAT MYTHS AND LEGENDS CAN TELL US 
ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THE MAP 
I'LL SEE HOW OUR MEDIEVAL FOREBEARS LIVED AND DIED 
AND UP ON BRITAIN'S WILD MOORS 
I'LL GO HUNTING WITH FALCONS AND EAGLES 
THE GOUGH MAP WAS MADE IN THE EARLY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTIES 
WHEN EDWARD THE THIRD WAS ON THE THRONE 
IT REPRESENTS A BREAKTHROUGH IN CARTOGRAPHY 
THE OLDEST SURVIVING MAP TO DEPICT BRITAIN ACCURATELY 
SHOWING TOWNS RIVERS MARKED IN GREEN 
AND NEARLY THREE THOUSAND MILES OF ROUTES MARKED IN RED 
BUT CREATING AN ACCURATE MAP OF BRITAIN 
WAS NOT THE SOLE MOTIVATION OF THE MAP MAKERS 
CONTAINED WITHIN IT ARE CLUES THAT SUGGEST THE GOUGH MAP WAS MADE 
TO LEGITIMISE THE MONARCHY 
AND TO SANCTION ROYAL AUTHORITY OVER THE REALM 
TODAY I'LL FOLLOW THE ONLY ROUTE INTO THE WEST COUNTRY 
MY FINAL DESTINATION IS DARTMOUTH 
WHERE I'LL EXPLORE ONE OF THE MOST ENIGMATIC INSCRIPTIONS ON THE MAP 
BUT MY JOURNEY STARTS IN HAMPSHIRE 
ONE THING THAT STRIKES YOU IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU GET ON THE ROAD 
IS THAT A LOT OF PLACES THAT ARE TODAY REALLY QUITE SMALL 
WERE ONCE HUGELY IMPORTANT 
THIS IS CERTAINLY TRUE OF WINCHESTER 
AT THE TIME OF THE GOUGH MAP IT WAS THE GATEWAY TO THE SOUTH WEST 
STRADDLING THE ONLY ROUTE FROM LONDON TO CORNWALL 
IT WAS A CENTRE OF POWER AND INFLUENCE 
ATTRACTING VISITORS FROM ALL OVER EUROPE 
WHEN THEY ARRIVED HERE THEY WOULD HAVE HEARD SOMETHING ASTONISHING 
WINCHESTER WAS FAMOUS FOR ITS CHOIR IT STILL IS 
BUT WHAT FEW VISITORS REALISED THEN AS NOW 
IS THAT WINCHESTER WAS THE BIRTHPLACE 
OF ONE OF THE GREATEST BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC 
SOMETHING CALLED THE WINCHESTER TROPER 
A MANUSCRIPT WHICH RECORDS A REVOLUTIONARY NEW WAY 
OF PERFORMING THE OLD CHANTS OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP 
WELL THE TROPER DATES FROM ABOUT SO IT'S JUST OVER ONE THOUSAND YEARS OLD 
WE THINK IT WAS WRITTEN BY A GENTLEMAN CALLED WULFSTAN THE CANTOR 
WE THINK THAT BECAUSE OF THE SCRIBBLINGS 
WE KNOW ARE IN HIS HANDWRITING 
TO UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT 
WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT WHAT WAS HAPPENING BEFORE THE BOOK STARTED 
WHEN WE HAD WHAT WE NOW CALL PLAINSONG 
WHICH IS VERY SIMPLY ONE LINE OF MUSIC 
WHICH WAS SUNG USUALLY BY EVERYBODY 
ALL SINGING AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME 
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THAT NOW 
THEN THE MONKS DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO DO SOMETHING A BIT MORE INVENTIVE 
ONE PERSON WOULD CARRY ON SINGING THE PLAINSONG 
AND ANOTHER ONE WOULD IMPROVISE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PART TO THAT 
AND THIS IS WHERE WE THINK WAS THE VERY VERY BEGINNINGS OF THE POLYPHONIC MOVEMENT 
AND WHAT'S POLYPHONY THEN 
IS THIS WHEN YOU'RE SINGING IN MORE THAN ONE 
IT'S MORE THAN ONE PART AND THE PARTS ARE VERY EQUALLY SPACED 
AND THEY INTERWEAVE THEIR OWN MELODIES 
AND THIS IS THE VERSION AS IT APPEARS IN THE TROPER ITSELF 
THEY SING IN HARMONY 
THE DIFFERENCE MAY SOUND SUBTLE TO OUR EARS 
BUT ONE THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE TROPER REPRESENTED A BOLD INNOVATION 
IT'S FUNNY TO THINK ISN'T IT THAT THERE WAS A TIME BEFORE POLYPHONY 
I MEAN IT SEEMS SO INTUITIVE TO US SO NATURAL 
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE MUSIC IN MORE THAN ONE PART 
EXACTLY AND AND IT'S BEEN FASCINATING TO WATCH THIS DEVELOP 
STARTING FROM THIS VERY SIMPLE ONE LINE OF MUSIC 
THAT WAS WRITTEN ON ONE LINE PHYSICALLY ONE LINE 
AND THE NOTES JUST STARTED TO GO UP AND DOWN 
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY COULD TELL 
THAT THEY WERE TO SING HIGHER OR SING LOWER 
AND THEN GRADUALLY ANOTHER LINE APPEARED AND SO YOU COULD GET HIGHER AND LOWER 
THEN THIS WHOLE THING OF ANOTHER PART 
NOW GOING THROUGH TO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRAS OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PLAYERS YOU KNOW 
BUT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THINGS LIKE THIS WINCHESTER TROPER 
THEY SING IN HARMONY 
I'M TAKING A BRIEF DETOUR FROM THE MAP'S RED ROUTE 
MY DESTINATION IS GLASTONBURY ABBEY 
WHAT HAPPENED THERE IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
PROVIDES A CLUE ABOUT THE REAL PURPOSE OF THE GOUGH MAP 
GLASTONBURY WAS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ABBEYS IN THE COUNTRY 
AT THE TIME OF THE GOUGH MAP 
IT OWED THIS PROMINENCE AT LEAST IN PART 
TO A LONGSTANDING AND HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN 
DESIGNED TO FLATTER AND LEGITIMISE THE ENGLISH CROWN 
THE ABBEY HELPED CREATE A LEGEND AROUND A MAN 
WHO HAD HE LIVED AT ALL HAD DIED AT THE DAWN OF THE MIDDLE AGES 
HIS NAME WAS KING ARTHUR 
THE ARTHUR LEGEND CAME OF AGE IN A COUNTRY 
THAT HAD REALLY ONLY BECOME A COHERENT CENTRALISED NATION 
A CENTURY OR SO BEFORE 
THE RULERS OF THE YOUNG KINGDOM NEEDED TO LEGITIMISE THEIR POWER 
ONE TECHNIQUE THAT THEY USED WAS TO INVENT OR FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW 
TO DISCOVER LEGENDS AND TRADITIONS BY STOKING THE ARTHUR MYTH 
AND CLAIMING HIM AS A BLOOD ANCESTOR 
THE KING SUDDENLY HAD A ROYAL HEROIC PREDECESSOR 
THE MONARCHY LOOKED FAVOURABLY 
ON ANYONE WHO UNEARTHED CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF THE ROYAL BLOOD LINE 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN ARTHURIAN RELICS STARTED POPPING UP ALL OVER THE PLACE 
SOMEONE FOUND ARTHUR'S CROWN 
SOMEONE ELSE FOUND EXCALIBUR AND HIS SIGNET RING 
THEY EVEN FOUND THE ROUND TABLE 
BUT THE MOST HIGHLY PRIZED FIND AND THE LINCHPIN OF THE NEW CULT 
WAS ARTHUR'S BODY AND THAT WAS FOUND HERE AT GLASTONBURY ABBEY 
AND UNDER HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES 
THIS FORTUITOUS DISCOVERY DESERVED A ROYAL FUNERAL 
A LAVISH CEREMONY WAS ARRANGED 
ATTENDED BY NONE OTHER THAN KING EDWARD I 
AND EDWARD HIMSELF WRAPPED ARTHUR'S ENORMOUS BONES IN CLOTH 
BEFORE THEY WERE REINTERRED RIGHT HERE 
IN WHAT WAS THEN THE VERY HEART OF GLASTONBURY ABBEY 
SO POTENT WAS THE LEGEND THAT NEARLY TWO HUNDRED YEARS 
AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF ARTHUR'S BODY HERE AT GLASTONBURY 
THE MAKERS OF THE GOUGH MAP SAW FIT TO INCLUDE FOUR SITES 
OF PARTICULARLY ARTHURIAN INTEREST 
HERE'S GLASTONBURY ITSELF 
AND TINTAGEL ARTHUR'S FORTRESS 
PENDRAGON CASTLE THE HOME OF ARTHUR'S FATHER IS HERE 
AND FINALLY THE WATHELAN 
A SMALL MAGICAL LAKE MENTIONED IN THE ARTHURIAN LEGENDS 
INCLUDING THESE FOUR SITES 
SUGGESTS THAT THE MAKERS OF THE GOUGH MAP 
WERE SEEKING TO LEGITIMISE THE MONARCHY 
WITH REFERENCES TO ITS POTENT ARTHURIAN HERITAGE 
FROM GLASTONBURY I'M HEADING SOUTH AND BACK ONTO THE RED ROUTE MARKED ON THE MAP 
ALONGSIDE ALL OF THE RED ROUTES ON THE MAP ARE ROMAN NUMERALS INDICATING DISTANCE 
AND THESE ARE PROBABLY IN OLD FRENCH MILES AS THE ENGLISH MILE HADN'T YET BEEN STANDARDISED 
THE GOUGH MAP IS THE OLDEST AND MAYBE EVEN THE FIRST MAP OF BRITAIN TO COMBINE ROUTES WITH DISTANCES 
AS EVERY ROUTE HAS THESE NUMERALS IT SEEMS THAT THE CARTOGRAPHER 
ONLY INCLUDED ROUTES WHEN HE KNEW THE PRECISE DISTANCES INVOLVED 
AT THE TIME OF THE GOUGH MAP THIS REGION WAS FAMOUS FOR ITS CIDER PRODUCTION IT STILL IS 
YOU MIGHT THINK OF CIDER AS THE QUINTESSENTIAL ENGLISH DRINK BUT ACTUALLY ITS MASS PRODUCTION 
WAS FIRST BROUGHT HERE BY THE NORMANS WHO MADE IT ON AN ALMOST INDUSTRIAL SCALE 
THE GOUGH MAP'S RED ROUTE TAKES ME TO HONITON WHERE THERE'S A MEDIEVAL STYLE CIDER MILL STILL IN OPERATION 
IT MAY BE ANCIENT BUT IT CAN STILL PRODUCE CIDER BY THE BARROW LOAD 
THE SHAPE OF THAT GRANITE WHEEL AND THE ACTUAL TROUGH IT RUNS IN 
IS SET SO THAT THE APPLES GET CHURNED ABOUT A BIT LIKE A PLOUGH 
AND AS THE WHEEL GOES AROUND THE APPLES FOLD IN BEHIND IT 
IF YOU LET IT DO ITS THING IT'S ACTUALLY WELL DESIGNED GET ON 
GET ON GET UP GET UP GET UP 
EVEN TODAY IN ENGLAND THE FRENCH ROOTS OF CIDER ARE REVEALED IN THE JARGON USED BY CIDER MAKERS 
THIS PULP IS CALLED POMACE 
WHICH COMES FROM POMME THE FRENCH FOR APPLE 
O. K. 
THE POMACE IS TAKEN FROM THE MILL TO THE CIDER PRESS 
WHY ARE THEY INTERLAYERING IT WITH STRAW O. K. 
IF YOU PUT A LAYER OF STRAW IN EVERY TWO INCHES THAT'LL ACTUALLY HOLD IT FIRM SO THAT IT'LL STAY SOLID 
AND THEN ALSO THE JUICE'LL RUN OUT THROUGH YOUR LAYERS OF STRAW AS WELL 
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS APPLYING PRESSURE AND THE JUICE'LL START TO RUN OUT 
FERMENTED FOR SIX MONTHS 
THIS ONE PRESSING WILL PRODUCE FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY LITRES OF CIDER 
IT'S JUST COMING OFF IN A TORRENT 
OH IT WILL DO IT WILL DO 
WOW BUT IT WASN'T TO LAST 
IN THE FOURTEEN HUNDREDS THE ARRIVAL OF HOPS FROM THE NETHERLANDS ALLOWED BRITISH BREWERS TO PRODUCE BEER 
IT SOON BECAME THE NATIONAL DRINK AND CIDER WAS OFF THE MENU 
IN THE LATER MIDDLE AGES A DEADLY DISEASE REACHED EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS IN BRITAIN 
IN THIS AREA ALONE MANY TOWNS WERE AFFECTED 
COLLIFORD HONITON TIVERTON AND EXMOUTH 
ALL APPEAR IN DOCUMENTS THAT CHRONICLE THE TERRIFYING SPREAD OF LEPROSY 
THESE MEDIEVAL SKELETONS BEAR THE TELLTALE SIGNS OF THE DEADLY DISEASE 
THE MOST EVOCATIVE AND DISTURBING ARE THOSE THAT AFFECT THE FACE 
SO THE NOSE ACTUALLY RECEDES AND DISAPPEARS 
WHERE YOU SEE IN THIS NORMAL INDIVIDUAL THAT THE NOSE STANDS 
QUITE PROUD FROM THE FACE WHEREAS THIS ONE IS QUITE RECEDED 
HE WOULD HAVE HAD PROBABLY VERY LITTLE NOSE LEFT 
THE DISEASE BASICALLY DESTROYS NERVE TISSUE 
THEY LOSE THE SENSATION OF THEIR HANDS AND FEET 
THEIR WALKING IS AFFECTED 
THE WAY THEY HOLD THINGS IS AFFECTED 
THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ARE AFFECTED 
THEY CAN'T SMILE 
THEIR VOICES ALTER SO THEY'RE VERY HOARSE SO IT REALLY DOES CHANGE THEIR IDENTITY 
LEPROSY ALLOWED SECONDARY INFECTIONS TO DESTROY BONES 
THIS FOOT BONE SHOWS HOW ONE LEPER SUFFERED 
WHAT IS A NORMAL QUITE STURDY SHAFT OF THE BONE HERE IS LITTLE MORE THAN A SMALL PROJECTION 
SO THAT SHOULD LOOK LIKE THAT THAT'S RIGHT YES YES 
MY GOD SO THIS IS NORMAL WHAT'S IN MY LEFT HAND 
WHAT WOULD BE LEFT OF THE FOOT AT THIS STAGE IS PROBABLY DIFFICULT TO RECOGNISE 
TOES IF THEY EXISTED AT ALL JUST A FLESHY PULP 
YES AND A FOOT THAT WAS SWOLLEN LACERATED 
FULL OF WEEPING SORES 
THERE WAS LITTLE THAT COULD BE DONE TO ALLEVIATE THEIR SUFFERING 
THE MEDIEVAL HOSPITAL IS MUCH LESS ABOUT TRYING TO CURE AN INDIVIDUAL PHYSICALLY 
AND MORE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE SORT OF SPIRITUAL ASPECTS THAN A MODERN HOSPITAL WILL BE 
THEY WOULD BE GIVEN IN MOST OF THESE HOUSES SOME KIND OF REMEDIAL CARE 
THAT MIGHT BE LITTLE MORE THAN JUST BATHING AND HEALTHY EATING AND OF COURSE SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE 
THE POPULAR IDEA NOW IS THAT THESE LEPER COLONIES WERE LIKE PRISONS 
BUT THEY DID SEEM TO OFFER LEPERS A KIND OF BETTER PLACE TO LIVE 
YEAH I THINK MORE OFTEN THEY OFFERED THEM A BETTER PLACE TO DIE 
NOT ONLY FOR DEATH BUT FOR THE LONG SUFFERING THAT LED UP TO DEATH 
AND DRAWING ILLUSIONS BETWEEN THAT LONG SUFFERING 
AND WHAT IT MEANT TO BE A CHRISTIAN A CHRISTIAN IN THE SORT OF SHAPE OF CHRIST AND HIS SUFFERING 
IN TODAY'S SOCIETY WHEN SOMEONE DIES IN THEIR SLEEP OR SOMETHING 
IT'S A STANDARD THING TO SAY OH AT LEAST THEY DIDN'T SUFFER 
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALWAYS STRIKES ME ABOUT MEDIEVAL DEATH 
IS THAT YOU GET THIS VERY DIFFERENT ATTITUDE WHERE IN FACT WHAT YOU MIGHT SAY OF ONE OF THESE LEPERS IS 
OH WELL AT LEAST THEY SUFFERED COS IT MEANS THAT THEY CAN 
WORK OFF SOME OF THEIR EARTHLY SIN BEFORE THEY DIE 
YEAH YES AND IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT CONCEPTION OF LIFE AND DEATH 
AND ONE THAT WE WOULD FIND I THINK PROBABLY QUITE SHOCKING AND UNACCEPTABLE 
FACED WITH SUCH RUDIMENTARY MEDICINE THE SICK AND AFFLICTED 
WOULD TURN TO GOD IN SEARCH OF TREATMENT 
AND IN THIS REGION ONE BUILDING ABOVE ALL 
STOOD PROUD ON THE HORIZON AS A PLACE WHERE MIRACLES COULD HAPPEN 
IN THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTIES AT ABOUT THE TIME THE GOUGH MAP WAS MADE 
THIS WEST FACADE OF EXETER CATHEDRAL WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY DAZZLING 
ALL OF THESE SCULPTURES WOULD HAVE BEEN PICKED OUT IN BRIGHT COLOURS 
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE FOR MILES AROUND 
DESPITE THE LOSS OF COLOUR EXETER CATHEDRAL LOOKS MUCH THE SAME TODAY AS IT WOULD HAVE SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
BUT WHAT WENT ON INSIDE THE CATHEDRAL BACK THEN WOULD PROBABLY STARTLE MODERN VISITORS 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BUSTLING NOISY PLACE 
JUGGLERS HAWKERS 
PEOPLE EVEN BROUGHT THEIR DOGS AND ON CERTAIN DAYS THERE WAS ACTUALLY A LOCAL MARKET 
THEY SOLD A SURPRISING RANGE OF GOODS IN HERE EVERYTHING FROM CHEAP WOOL TO SMALL DEVOTIONAL OBJECTS 
LIKE THE WAX VOTIVES THAT PILGRIMS WOULD USE IN ORDER TO CHANNEL GOD'S HEALING POWER 
UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY IT WAS THOUGHT THAT NONE OF THESE WAX VOTIVES HAD SURVIVED 
FAST FORWARD SIX HUNDRED YEARS TO NINETEEN FORTY THREE WHEN EXETER WAS RECOVERING FROM A VISIT BY HITLER'S LUFTWAFFE 
THIS ENTIRE AREA WAS COVERED IN DEBRIS AND AS WORKMEN BEGAN TO RESTORE THE CATHEDRAL 
THEY MADE AN ASTONISHING DISCOVERY RIGHT ABOVE THIS TOMB 
A HIDDEN HOARD OF WAX VOTIVES SMALL SCULPTURES CAST IN THE SHAPE OF THE BODY OR ANIMAL PART 
FOR WHICH THE PILGRIM WAS SEEKING A MIRACULOUS CURE 
THIS ONE IS PART OF A HORSE'S HEAD 
WOW HOW MARVELLOUS OH HE'S BEAUTIFUL 
SHALL I GIVE THEM TO YOU DO YOU MIND IF I HAVE A LOOK 
IT'S AMAZING THAT THEY SURVIVED THEY'RE SO THIN THE WAX 
YEAH THEY ARE INCREDIBLY FRAGILE THE CRAFTSMANSHIP IS LOVELY 
SO DO YOU THINK THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS A SICK HORSE 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK YES 
WELL POSSIBLY EVEN A SICK HORSE'S HEAD CAN I JUST 
AND WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT 
WAS HUNG ON WAXED STRINGS ABOVE THE TOMB OF BISHOP LACY 
BISHOP EDMOND LACY WAS BISHOP OF EXETER FOR THIRTY FIVE OR SO YEARS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY 
AND CAME TO BE VENERATED LOCALLY 
AND COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN MADE A SAINT ONE ASSUMES 
BUT THE REFORMATION INTERVENED AS IT WERE 
AND TOWARDS THE END OF HIS LIFE HE BECAME VERY ILL 
IN DIFFERENT WAYS BUT NOTABLY HE HAD BAD LEGS 
THIS COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE APPARENT PREPONDERANCE OF LEGS AND FEET AMONG THE FRAGMENTS OF THE VOTIVES 
AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A FOOT INSIDE A SHOE 
SO WHOEVER WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THIS PARTICULAR MOULD 
WOULD HAVE HAD GOUT OR SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEIR FEET 
WHAT'S REALLY MARVELLOUS TO ME AS AN AS AN ART HISTORIAN IS THAT VERY OFTEN THE KIND OF THINGS I LOOK AT 
ARE SUPER HIGH STATUS WORKS OF ART CATHEDRALS STAINED GLASS 
BUT WHAT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY LOST TO US ARE THE EPHEMERAL THINGS 
THE KIND OF EVERYDAY OBJECTS THAT ORDINARY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 
SO IT'S JUST SUCH A FANTASTIC THING TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
BUT THE UNDAMAGED MODEL OF A WOMAN WAS THE PRIZE DISCOVERY 
THAT'S HER IN ALL HER GLORY 
YOU CAN REALLY SEE DETAILS OF HER COSTUME BUTTONS ON HER SLEEVE 
SHE'S QUITE AN ELEGANT LADY SHE IS 
AND AS ALL THE IMAGES ARE IS HOLLOW SO VERY LIGHT AND VERY FRAGILE 
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY OTHER EXAMPLES SURVIVE OR IS THIS BASICALLY WHAT WE HAVE 
I THINK IN BRITAIN THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT WE HAVE YES 
THE EXETER WAX VOTIVES ARE A UNIQUE LEGACY 
FROM AN AGE WHERE FAITH WAS CONSIDERED THE ROUTE TO HEALTH AND LONGEVITY 
I'M HEADING UP ONTO DARTMOOR 
IN WEATHER AS INHOSPITABLE AS THIS IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY THE MAP MAKERS 
SAW FIT TO DEPICT THIS DESOLATE PLACE AS A LARGE EMPTY CIRCLE 
IN FACT MANY OF BRITAIN'S MOST DANGEROUS PLACES ARE SKETCHILY REPRESENTED 
LIKE THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS AND SNOWDONIA IN WALES 
DESPITE THE DANGERS MOORS AND HIGHLANDS WERE USED FOR HUNTING 
AND ONE FORM IN PARTICULAR TOOK OFF IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
FALCONRY 
UNDER NORMAN LAW HUNTING WITH BIRDS WAS THE EXCLUSIVE PRESERVE OF THE NOBILITY 
THEN AT THE TURN OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY AN ACT WAS PASSED ALLOWING ANY FREEMAN TO KEEP HAWKS 
AND BY THE LATE MIDDLE AGES THIS TYPE OF HUNTING HAD PERVADED ALMOST EVERY LAYER OF MEDIEVAL SOCIETY 
HOWEVER ALLOWING ANY TOM DICK OR HAROLD TO PARTICIPATE DIDN'T CHANGE 
THE FACT THAT MEDIEVAL SOCIETY HAD A FEARSOMELY RIGID CLASS STRUCTURE 
THE BIRDS THEMSELVES EACH BECAME LINKED WITH A PARTICULAR SOCIAL CLASS 
THE LESS FANCY FALCONS AND HAWKS WERE SUITABLE FOR THE LOWER TIERS OF SOCIETY 
SO A KESTREL LIKE THIS WAS FOR A KNAVE 
A KNAVE BEING A SERVANT OR A MAN OF HUMBLE BIRTH 
WHEREAS A MALE PEREGRINE A TIERCEL WAS CONSIDERED SUITABLE FOR A PRINCE 
THE LARGEST FALCON THE GYR BEING RATHER MORE GLAMOROUS WAS IDEAL FOR A KING 
HOWEVER TOP OF THE CHARTS WAS THIS THE EAGLE 
A BIRD LIKE THIS WAS DEEMED FIT FOR AN EMPEROR 
BIRDS OF PREY WERE CONSIDERED SO SPECIAL 
THEY WERE USED AS PEACE OFFERINGS OR AS TOKENS OF RESPECT AND FRIENDSHIP 
THE KING OF SCOTLAND ONCE GAVE EDWARD THE THIRD A SINGLE GYR FALCON AS A PRESENT 
EDWARD WAS SO THRILLED THAT HE TIPPED THE MAN WHO DELIVERED IT FORTY SHILLINGS THE EQUIVALENT OF NINE HUNDRED 
THE HUNTING STYLE VARIED DEPENDING ON THE BIRD BEING USED 
THE FALCONS ARE AERIAL PREDATORS AND THEY'D BE USED FOR HUNTING GROUSE 
IT WAS THE SHEER DASH OF THE FALCONS THAT ATTRACTED NOBILITY 
ON A GOOD DAY WITH THE WIND BEHIND HIM ONE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM FOR THIS LITTLE FELLOW 
WHEN THE FALCONER WAS READY HE'D SEND THE DOGS IN 
THE GROUSE WOULD FLUSH AND THEN THEY'D GO FOR THE VERTICAL STOOP OF THE FALCON 
STRAIGHT DOWN ON THE PREY 
WHEREAS THE FALCON IS UP HUNTING WITH EAGLES YOU'LL HUNT OFF THE FIST 
YOU'LL FLUSH QUARRY THE EAGLE WILL SEE THEM 
AND IT'LL GO FOR IT 
WHEREAS THE FALCON IS USING SPEED TO OVERWHELM ITS QUARRY 
EAGLES WILL USE SHEER PHYSICAL SIZE AND STRENGTH TO OVERWHELM IT 
I'M HEADING SOUTH TOWARDS DARTMOUTH AND MY FINAL DESTINATION 
BUT WHAT REALLY INTERESTS ME LIES SOUTH OF HERE 
A POSSIBLE CLUE TO WHY THE MAP WAS MADE 
IN FADED BARELY LEGIBLE WRITING IS AN INTRIGUING INSCRIPTION 
IT READS 
HERE BRUTUS LANDED WITH THE TROJANS 
ACCORDING TO LEGEND BRUTUS WAS A WARRIOR WHO FLED FROM THE CITY OF TROY 
AFTER ITS FALL AND CAME TO ENGLAND WHERE HE LANDED AT DARTMOUTH 
THE LEGEND CONTINUES THAT BRUTUS WAS THE FOUNDER OF THE KINGDOM OF BRITAIN 
BUT WAS THE FOREFATHER ONLY OF THE ENGLISH KINGS 
BY INCLUDING THIS INSCRIPTION THE MAP MAKER IS PRESENTING A POWERFUL MESSAGE 
THE ENGLISH KINGS WERE THE RIGHTFUL RULERS OF ALL BRITAIN 
EDWARD I EVEN USED THIS LEGEND 
TO JUSTIFY HIS WARS AGAINST SCOTLAND IN A LETTER TO THE POPE 
WHO HAD DEMANDED THAT HE BRING HIS CAMPAIGNS AGAINST SCOTLAND TO AN END 
THE GOUGH MAP REPRESENTS BRITAIN MORE FAITHFULLY THAN ANY OTHER MAP OF ITS TIME 
BUT IT DOES MUCH MORE THAN THAT 
ITS NUMEROUS REFERENCES TO THE KING'S HERITAGE 
SUGGEST THE CARTOGRAPHERS WERE MINDED TO DO MORE THAN JUST CHART BRITAIN'S GEOGRAPHY 
THIS ISN'T JUST A MAP OF TERRAIN AND TOPOGRAPHY IT'S A MAP OF BELIEFS AND SYMBOLS AS WELL 
THE FACT THAT THE LEGENDS OF BRUTUS AND ARTHUR ARE GIVEN SUCH PHYSICAL REALITY ON THIS MAP 
HINTS THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE WITH THE KING OF ENGLAND HIMSELF IN MIND 
THE GOUGH MAP WAS NOT SIMPLY MADE FOR PLOTTING JOURNEYS BUT FOR PLANNING KINGDOMS 
IT WAS A STATEMENT OF IMPERIAL AMBITION 
THE LONGSTANDING PLANTAGENET DREAM OF A UNITED ISLAND NATION 
BUT IT ALSO SUGGESTS THE EPIC NATURE OF THE KING'S OWN BLOOD LINES 
EXTENDING WAY BACK IN TIME BEYOND CHRIST AND TO THE DAWN OF HISTORY ITSELF
