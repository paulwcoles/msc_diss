GOOD EVENING SHOWERS HAVE BEEN MORE LIMITED TODAY 
AND WE'VE HAD GOOD SUNSHINE TODAY AS WE'LL SEE TOMORROW 
HOWEVER FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS THE CHILLY BREEZE IS GOING TO NAG 
AND WILL BRING A CHANGE IN OUR WEATHER 
THIS IS ALL GANGING UP TO THE SOUTH 
AND WILL COME IN BY FRIDAY BRINGING A CHANGE 
TO THE GLORIOUS WEATHER IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND 
MEANWHILE FOCUSING ON THIS AREA OF CLOUD 
BRINGING RAIN SLEET AND SNOW IN OFF THE NORTH SEA 
WE COULD EXPECT SEVERAL CENTIMETRES OF SNOW 
OVER THE PENNINES AND PEAK DISTRICT THROUGH THE NIGHT 
AND A COUPLE OF CENTIMETRES OVER NORTH WALES BY RUSH HOUR 
SO NASTY ON THE ROADS HERE 
AND FROST FOR SCOTLAND 
BUT FOR MOST OF US THE WIND WILL KEEP THE FROST AT BAY 
A MISERABLE RUSH HOUR ACROSS THE NORTH WALES COAST THE A FIFTY FIVE SPECIALLY 
WITH SLEET COMING DOWN HERE 
A MORE CLOUDY START TO THE DAY ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND THAN RECENTLY 
EVEN A FEW SHOWERS 
A COLD FROSTY START FOR MANY PARTS OF SCOTLAND 
IN THE EAST OF SCOTLAND A BIT MORE CLOUD AROUND 
STILL A LOT OF CLOUD IN NORTH EAST ENGLAND 
STILL THOSE SHOWERS ACROSS NORTHERN ENGLAND AND THE MIDLANDS 
PERHAPS AS FAR SOUTH AS LEICESTER EARLY ON THURSDAY 
FURTHER SOUTH GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE TO START THE DAY 
DRY RELATIVELY CHILLY BUT THE BREEZE WILL KEEP FROST AND FOG AT BAY 
BECAUSE WE HAD FOG AS WE STARTED WEDNESDAY MORNING 
THE SHOWERS ACROSS NORTHERN ENGLAND AND THE MIDLANDS PETER OUT 
BRIGHTER SKIES FILTER THROUGH FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AS WELL 
BUT WE'VE GOT MORE SHOWERS OR RAIN TO COME LATER IN THE DAY 
ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTHERN ENGLAND WHICH WILL BE HEAVY 
AND EXTEND UP TOWARDS SOUTH EAST SCOTLAND 
IT'S LESS LIKELY WE'LL SEE WINTRY PROBLEMS JUST THE TOPS OF THE HILLS 
SO NOT A BAD DAY FOR MANY PARTS OF SCOTLAND 
IT'S JUST THAT BREEZE WHICH WILL MAKE IT FEEL COLDER 
EVENTUALLY NORTHERN IRELAND WILL BRIGHTEN UP AND DRY UP 
AS WE HEAD INTO THE AFTERNOON NINE DEGREES IN BELFAST 
IT'S A CHILLY TWELVE DEGREES IN CARDIFF WITH THAT EASTERLY WIND 
SHOWERS IN THE AFTERNOON BUT BETTER THAN THE MORNING 
HOPEFULLY SOUTHERN ENGLAND WILL SEE FEW SHOWERS 
BUT LOOK AT THIS A TWENTY SIX M. P. H. WIND A STEADY WIND A FRESH WIND 
THEY COULD TOUCH GALE FORCE IN THE CHANNEL 
THAT SHOWS THE DIFFERENCE IT WILL MAKE TO MOST OF US 
A NAGGING EASTERLY WIND WHICH WILL PUSH RAIN WESTWARDS 
DURING THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING 
AGAIN NOT SO COLD BECAUSE OF THE WIND 
BY FRIDAY MORNING THERE'S A PROSPECT OF RAIN IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND 
SOUTH WALES THE MIDLANDS AND EAST ANGLIA SO A VERY DIFFERENT DAY HERE 
IT WILL FEEL COLD TOO IN THE WIND 
THE BEST SUNSHINE AND DRY WEATHER WILL BE FURTHER NORTH 
THAT'S WHERE IT WILL STAY INTO THE WEEKEND AS WELL 
BECAUSE THAT RAIN HEADS FURTHER NORTH ON SATURDAY 
AS WE HEAD FURTHER SOUTH 
YOU CAN SEE THE RAIN EVIDENT ON SATURDAY 
BY SUNDAY THINGS LOOK A LITTLE BRIGHTER AND WARMER 
WE LOSE THAT NAGGING WIND 
THE MAIN FEATURE OF THE WEATHER 
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
THERE'S SNOW POTENTIALLY TONIGHT ACROSS NORTHERN ENGLAND BYE BYE
