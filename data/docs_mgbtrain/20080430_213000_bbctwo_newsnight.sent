INTERVIEW I 
ASKED 
HER HOW SHE 
SURVIVED HER EIGHT YEAR ORDEAL 
SURVIVED HER EIGHT YEAR ORDEAL WHAT HAD KEPT HER WELL 
I THOUGHT THAT 
COULDN'T HAVE 
BEEN THE LIFE 
PREDESTINED FOR TO 
ROT AWAY IN 
THAT BASEMENT SO 
YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT YOU 
SO YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD ESCAPE 
AND WHAT WAS 
IT LIKE 
AND WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR YOU WHEN YOU 
FINALLY DID ESCAPE 
THE NEW 
YOU GOT 
OUT INTO THE I 
EXPECTED IT TO 
A 
THAT WAY A NOVELTY PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS 
AND WE LIVE 
IN A MEDIA AGE 
SO HOW DID 
YOU FEEL WHEN 
SO HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE EVENTS AT 
AMSTETTEN AMSTETTEN WELL AT THE 
I THOUGHT THAT 
SOMETHING TERRIBLE 
I THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE MUST HAVE 
AND LITTLE BY 
THAT THERE WERE 
PARALLELS TO MY OWN 
FATE SO THEN 
FATE SO THEN THE WHOLE STORY AFFECTED 
ME EVEN MORE 
AND FROM 
YOUR EXPERIENCES HOW CAN ELISABETH 
FRITZL AND THE REST OF THE 
FAMILY 
FRITZL AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY BEST BE HELPED NOW 
THEY NEED LOT OF SILENCE 
AND TIME WOUNDS WHY 
DO EVENTS LIKE 
SEEM TO HAPPEN HERE IN 
IT JUST 
BAD 
LUCK OR 
I WORLDWIDE 
BUT I THINK IT 
WORLDWIDE BUT I THINK IT IS ALSO A RAMIFICATION OF THE SECOND WORLD 
AND IT'S CONNECTED 
TO 
AND IT'S CONNECTED TO EDUCATION AND SO 
I THINK 
IT CAN 
HAPPEN EVERYWHERE 
AND IT 
ALSO EXISTS 
AND IT ALSO EXISTS EVERYWHERE NOT JUST 
YOU MENTIONED THE SECOND WORLD WAR IN WHAT WAY 
AT 
THE TIME OF 
THE SUPRESSION 
OF WOMEN WAS PROP 
THE SUPRESSION OF WOMEN WAS PROP GAITED GAITED 
AUTHORISATION SO 
COULD THERE BE 
CHANGES WHICH 
COULD STOP THIS HAPPENING AGAIN OF 
COULD STOP THIS HAPPENING AGAIN OF COURSE ONE CAN CHANGE 
AND ONE WOULD HAVE 
TO START WITH 
THE EDUCATION OF THE YOUNGEST 
THE EDUCATION OF THE YOUNGEST OF US YOU 
ARE NOW SETTING UP 
HELP THE 
FAMILY HOW WOULD YOU LIKE 
HELP THE FAMILY HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THAT MONEY I 
WOULD SAY IT 
IS UP 
TO THEM BUT I 
WOULD ASSUME THEY WOULD 
USE 
SUBSIDISE THEIR LIVING EXPENSES 
YOU HAVE SURVIVED THIS ORDEAL DO 
YOU THINK THE FAMILY WILL SURVIVE 
IT AS WELL 
I DON'T 
KNOW DOES MY LIFE HAVE SUCH A 
HAPPY SIDE TO IT THAT'S STILL TO 
BE DETERMINED 
BUT I WISH THE FAMILY THE BEST OF 
LUCK AND HOPE THAT THEY WILL PULL 
THROUGH AND I THINK THAT AT LEAST 
THE YOUNGEST ONES WILL SUCCEED YOU YOU SEEM TO BE DOING VERY WELL NOW DO 
YOU STILL SUFFER BECAUSE OF YOUR 
EXPERIENCES EXPERIENCES 
SUFFERING IS PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT WORD BUT IT STAYS 
WITH YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE 
NATASCHA KAMPUSCH THANK YOU 
AND IN NEWSNIGHT TOMORROW I WILL 
BE LOOKING AT WHAT THIS 
EXTRAORDINARY CASE HAS MEANT TO 
AUSTRIA ONE POLITICIAN HERE TOLD 
ME TONIGHT IT'S LIKE OUR OWN NINE ELEVEN 
WELL AS ROBIN SAID IN THAT REPORT 
NATASCHA KAMPUSCH HAS SET UP 
CHARITY TO HELP THE AUSTRIAN FAMILY 
IMPRISONED BY JOSEF FRITZL FOR 
DETAILS THERE IS A LINK ON OUR 
WEBSITE WEBSITE THE U. S. FEDERAL RESERVE CUT INTEREST 
RATES AGAIN TONIGHT BY ONE QUARTER 
OF A PERCENTAGE POINT THE MOVE 
CAME ON THE DAY THE U. S. ECONOMY WAS 
WIDELY EXPECTED TO BE PRONOUNCED 
OFFICIALLY IN RECESSION BUT IT 
WASN'T OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR PAUL 
MASON IS HERE TO MAKE SENSE OF THE 
FIGURES MUCH IT IS NOT A RECESSION 
BUT IT IS NOT GREAT 
IT IS NOT 
GREAT AT ALL WE ARE BEGINNING TO 
REALISE IT MAY HAVE REPERCUSSIONS 
HERE IF WE STICK WITH THE AMERICAN 
FIGURES FOR A MINUTE AT TECHNICAL 
DEFINITION OF A RECESSION IS TWO 
QUARTERS OF REGULAR NIF GROWTH WE 
DIDN'T GET THAT WE GOT OH SIX PER CENT GROWTH 
IF THE BRITS HAD MEASURED THAT IT 
WOULD BE CLOSE TO ZERO SOME OF THE 
DETAIL IS BAD MUCH THERE IS A TWENTY SIX PER CENT 
FALL ON NEW HOUSE BUILDING THE 
ONLY THING THAT KEPT THEM OUT OF 
RECESSION IS THE AMERICAN COMPANIES 
BUYING STUFF PUTTING IT INTO THE 
WAREHOUSE AND NOT SELLING IT IT 
CAN'T GO ON THE FRIGHTENER IS 
HOUSE PRICES WE HAVE A GRAPH 
SHOWING AVERAGE HOUSE PRICES IN TEN 
AMERICAN CITIES OVER TWO DECADES 
LOOK AT THE CLIFF IT HAS FALLEN OFF 
IT IS TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT DOWN SOME PEOPLE THINK 
IT COULD HALVE BEFORE IT IS OVER 
THAT'S SCARY STUFF WE KNOW THE 
CLICHE IF THEY SNEEZE WE GET A 
COLD WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK ARE THE 
LIKELYHOODS OF PARALLELS HERE 
THERE IS A DEBATE ABOUT THAT 
TONIGHT THE GOVERNMENT POSITION 
AND THAT OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS 
BRITAIN'S IS RESILIENT IT'LL 
PROBABLY RIDE OUT A RECESSION BUT 
LAST NIGHT A KEY POLICY MAKER GAVE 
A LECTURE WHICH SAID IT IS ALL 
WRONG PROFESSOR DAVID 
BLANCHEFLOWER SAID CONTAGION IS 
RISING HOUSE PRICES TO FALL BY 
ONE THIRD AND THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
SHOULD CUT INTEREST RATES FASTER 
IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT WHILE THE 
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T AGGRO WITH 
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE 
CITY THAT DO DOESN'T AGREE WITH 
THAT THERE ARE A WILL THE OF 
PEOPLE IN THE CITY THAT DO 
CASE THAT THE U. K. WILL FOLLOW 
THE U. S. BECAUSE THE M. P. C. IS MAKING 
THE SAME POLICY MISTAKES THAT THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE MADE WHEN THEY 
DITHERED OVER CUTTING INTEREST 
RATES AND WE DIDN'T GET THE FIRST 
RATE CUT UNTIL DECEMBER LAST YEAR 
THE M. P. C. IS BEING SLOW CUTTING 
INTEREST RATES IGNORING THE 
EVIDENCE THAT HOUSE PRICES ARE 
FALLING SHARPLY IF YOU 
THE 
NATIONWIDE INDEX THAT CAME OUT THIS 
MORNING WE ARE GOING DOWN FASTER 
THAN AT THE WORST POINT OF THE 
EARLY NINETEEN NINETY CRASH 
A REFLECTION 
THERE OF THE FRUSTRATION THAT SOME 
PEOPLE IN THE CITY FEEL ABOUT HOW 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS HANDLING 
THIS ANY SENSE THAT THEY MIGHT 
CHANGE 
WELL THE RULES WOULD HAVE CHANGE TO CHANGE GORDON BROWN WOULD HAVE 
TO CHANGE THE RULES THEY OPERATE BY 
THERE IS NOT MUCH CHANCE OF THAT 
THE PRIME MINISTER GAVE A SPEECH 
TODAY WHICH I THINK WAS SIGNIFICANT 
HE SET OUT HIS STALL ABOUT HOW HE 
IS LIKELY TO DEAL WITH ANY ECONOMIC 
DOWNTURN THE KEY WORD WAS LONG 
TERM 
BUSINESSMEN HE 
TERM SPEAKING TO BUSINESSMEN HE SAID LOW INFLATION IN THIS 
COUNTRY IS NOT SOME SHORT TERM 
THING IT IS KEY TO THE STRATEGIC 
POSITION BRITAIN WILL HAVE TO THE 
WHOLE TWENTY ONE CENTURY THEY ARE NOT 
GOING TO GIVE IT UP HIS MANTRA 
BECAME THE RIGHT DECISIONS FOR 
THE LONG TERM THIS IS ALL RIGHT 
EXCEPT IF BLANCHEFLOWER IS RIGHT 
AND HOUSE PRICES IN THIS COUNTRY 
FOLLOW THAT GRAPH WE SAW IN AMERICA 
AND THEY FALL BY ONE THIRD THEN 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY 
BY NEXT YEAR WILL BE IN NEGATIVE 
EQUITY AND THEY ARE VOTERS AND THEY 
WON'T THINK ABOUT THE LONG TERM 
THEY WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO COMPARE 
WITH THE RELATIVE VIGOUR OF THE FED 
IN AMERICA CUTTING RATES AGAIN AND 
SIGNALLING POSSIBLY MORE TODAY 
WITH THE RELATIVE CAUTION OF THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND 
POLITICAL DAY 
ALL ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES BY 
THIS TIME TOMORROW NIGHT THE POLLS 
HAVE WILL HAVE CLOSED ON FRIDAY WE 
WILL FIND OUT WHO THE NEXT MAYOR OF 
LONDON IS LIKELY TO BE WITH NEWS 
OF THE FINAL DASH TOWARDS ONE OF 
TOMORROW'S BIGGEST POLITICAL PRIZES 
HERE IS DAVID GROSSMAN 
THERE IS A DISTINCTLY RETRO FEEL TO 
THIS LONDON ELECTION NOT SINCE THE 
EARLY EIGHTY S. S. HAS THE CAPITAL BEEN THE 
FRONT LINE IN THE BATTLE BETWEEN 
LABOUR AND THE CONSERVATIVES WHAT 
IS HAPPENING HERE COULD EASILY ONCE 
AGAIN DEFINE NATIONAL POLITICS 
LONDON IS OF COURSE ALWAYS AN 
IMPORTANT CITY BUT POLITICALLY IT'S 
BEEN WELL SOMETHING OF BACK WATER 
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS ALTHOUGH 
THIS IS THE THIRD MAYORAL CONTEST 
THE LAST TWO HAVE GONE TO 
EXPECTATIONS THIS ONE THOUGH IS 
DIFFERENT IT SEEMS WIDE OPEN 
BECAUSE OF THAT EACH OF THE 
PARTIES HAS SOMETHING TO WIN AND 
SOMETHING TO LOSE FOR ALL OF THEM 
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT TEST OF 
VOTER OPINION THIS SIDE OF 
GENERAL ELECTION 
THERE ARE A 
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE CHANGED 
SINCE LONDON VOTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR FOR A 
MAYOR FIRST BORIS JOHNSON IS A 
CELEBRITY CANDIDATE HE IS VERY 
WELL KNOWN ACTUALLY HE WORKS WELL 
TO BRING THE WHOLE OF THE 
CONSERVATIVE TRIBE TOGETHER TO VOTE 
SECOND LABOUR IS IF ANYTHING 
MORE UNPOPULAR ACCORDING TO THE 
POLLS NOW THAN THEY WERE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
THIRD KEN LIVINGSTONE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A 
VERY LONG TIME THE BRITISH 
ELECTORATE BEGINS TO FEEL UNEASY IF 
OVER POWERFUL PEOPLE STAY AROUND IN 
OFFICE FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD 
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT 
SCHEME I HAVE SAID THAT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN 
LONDON POLITICS FOR NEARLY FOUR 
DECADES HATE FIGURE FOR MRS. 
THATCHER'S CONSERVATIVES HE WENT ON 
TO DO BAT WELL NEW LABOUR 
IN TWO THOUSAND HE WON THE MAYORAL TITLE AS 
AN INDEPENDENT 
NOW THOUGH THE WEATHER HAS GOT A 
LITTLE WORSE FOR KEN LIVINGSTONE 
SEEKING A THIRD TERM AS THE LABOUR 
CANDIDATE IT IS HARDER FOR HIM TO 
CAMPAIGN AS AN ANTI ESTABLISHMENT 
OUTSIDER HE INSIST HE HAS PLENTY 
MORE TO OFFER 
I'M THE NLY PERSON 
THAT IS GOING TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT 
WE BUILD THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES FOR RENT AT 
LOW RENTS THAT PEOPLE CAN AFFORD 
WITH RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS IN 
THE NEXT THREE YEARS WE HAVEN'T 
HAD A HOUSING PROGRAMME LIKE THAT 
SINCE PLLS THATCHER CAME TO POWER 
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE LAND AND THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN US THE MONEY 
I'M DETERMINED THAT WILL BE DONE 
ALL THE KIDS THAT HAVE BEEN FAILED 
BY OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM OVER THE 
LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM 
A SECOND 
THIS IS MODERN WORLD 
AT SMITHFIELD MARKET THE 
CONSENSUS IS THAT KEN LIVINGSTONE 
IS DEAD MEAT HIS MAIN OPPONENT IS 
BORIS JOHNSON AN M. P. AND FORMER 
JOURNALIST WITH REPUTATION FOR 
BRINGING BIT OF COLOUR AND CHAOS 
TO POLITICS HE WAS AN UNEXPECTED 
CHOICE AS CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE 
HIS AGENDA THOUGH HE SAYS IS 
ANYTHING BUT FRIVOLOUS 
WHAT I'VE 
GOT TO OFFER IS ENERGY AND NEW 
THINKING ABOUT THE THINGS THAT 
REALLY MATTER TO LONDONERS HOUSING 
TRANSPORT AND ABOVE ALL MAKING THE 
STREETS SAVER WILL YOU SEE AN END 
TO THE ROWDYNESS ON THE BUS WE 
WILL STOP PEOPLE DRINKING ALCOHOL 
ON THE TUBE AND INTIMIDATING OTHER 
PASSENGERS WE WILL DRIVE DOWN THE 
CULTURE OF TOLERANCE OF MINOR CRIME 
THAT IS LEADING THIS CITY TO BE FAR 
MORE PRONE TWICE AS PRONE TO 
MUGGINGS AS NEW YORK 
THIS IS MODERN WORLD 
WHO DO YOU NORMALLY VOTE FOR BRIAN BRIAN PADDICK IS THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT'S 
CANDIDATE NEW TO POLITICS HE WAS A 
SENIOR POLICEMAN IN THE MET 
EXPERIENCED HE SAYS HE IS BEST 
QUALIFIED FOR THE JOB OF MAYOR 
SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL 
POLITICIAN I SPENT THE LAST THIRTY 
YEARS LEARNING ABOUT WHAT THE 
PROBLEMS ARE WITH LONDON TALKING 
TO LONDONERS WALKING THE STREETS 
GOING INTO LONDONER'S HOMES L. KNOW 
FROM THE INSIDE WHAT THE PROBLEMS 
ARE I'VE GOT A GOOD IDEA WHAT THE 
SOLUTIONS RFPLT I DON'T THINK 
EITHER OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES CAN 
SAY THAT 
SMALLER PARTIES ARE GOING TO HAVE A 
BIG SEVENTY EIGHT IMPACT ON THIS ELECTION TOO 
PARTLY BY GETTING SEATS ON THE 
LONDON ASSEMBLY BECAUSE SOME OF 
THOSE ARE GIVEN OUT ON A 
PROPORTIONAL BASIS 
LAST TIME THE B. N. P. CAME CLOSE TO 
GETTING A SEAT AND COULD MANAGE IT 
THIS TIME IN CONTEST FOR MAYOR 
THERE ARE A TOTAL OF TEN CANDIDATES 
THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM MEANS IT'S NOT 
A STRAIGHT RACE VOTERS GET TO PICK 
A FIRST AND SECOND CHOICE CANDIDATE 
YOU CAN'T PLEASE ALL THE PEOPLE 
TRUE YOU CAN'T PLEASE ALL THE 
PEOPLE ALL THE TIME THE VOTING 
SYSTEM IN LONDON MEANS THAT THE 
MOST SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE WILL 
PROBABLE BE THE ONE THAT DISPLEASES 
AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE HOVERING 
UP THE MOST SECOND PREFERENCE VOTES 
THERE SAN ELEMENT OF BEING THE 
LEASE UNPOPULAR CERTAINLY IF YOU 
HAVE THE LABOUR OR CONSERVATIVE 
CANDIDATE YOU WILL WANT TO SIGNAL 
TO LIBERAL DEMOCRAT GREEN AND 
OTHER VOTERS THAT YOU ARE QUITE 
NICE FOR THEM THAT YOU HAVE A 
GREEN TINGE 
PLEASE WELCOME THE 
PRIME MINISTER OF GREAT BRITAIN 
GORDON BROWN GORDON BROWN AND KEN 
LIVINGSTONE ARE NOT EXACTLY CLOSE 
FRIENDS THEY FELL OUT SPECTACULARLY 
OVER THE CONTRACTS TO MODERNISE THE 
LONDON UNDERGROUND IN THIS 
ELECTION THEY THEIR FAITHS ARE 
INTERTWINED 
IF LABOUR WERE TO LOSE INTERTWINED LONDON IT WOULD HERALD A REALLY 
SUMMER FOR GORDON BROWN LABOUR M. P.'S 
WILL SAY HOLD ON A SECOND IF WE 
CAN'T HOLD ON TO LONDON OUR SEATS 
ARE IN DANGER THEY WILL COME OUT 
AND SAY THAT IN THE MEDIA THAT 
WILL FEED ON ITSELF CONVERSELY IF 
DAVID CAMERON WERE TO WIN LONDON 
OR BORIS JOHNSON WERE TO WIN LONDON 
CAMERON COULD SAY WE HAVE GOT THIS 
GREAT JEWEL IN THIS CROWN THE BIG 
CITY WE HAVE WON AND BLAME TO BE AN 
ALTERNATIVE GOVERNMENT IT DOESN'T 
MEET MEAN IT IS THE END OF THE 
MATTER BROWN WILL NOT BE FINISHED 
TWO YEARS BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION 
CAMERON HAS MORE QUESTIONS TO 
ANSWER LONDON WILL BE A PIVOTAL 
REVOLT AND WILL SHAPE BRITISH 
POLITICS OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS 
THIS IS A MODERN WORLD 
WE DON'T NEED TO TELL NO ONE 
WITH FIFTY FIVE MILLION REGISTERED VOTERS 
THE RESULT IN LONDON WILL INFLUENCE 
THE POLITICAL WEATHER FOR THE 
SUMMER AND BEYOND 
THIS YEAR LONDON WILL SET THE 
FASHION COULD IT BE SWINGING 
LONDON WE WON'T KNOW THE RESULTS 
UNTIL LATE ON FRIDAY 
THIS IS MODERN WORLD 
HERE IS A FULL LIST OF THE MAYORAL 
CANDIDATES FOR LONDON BEFORE YOUR 
VERY EYES NOW IN THE LAST OF OUR 
SERIES OF PRE ELECTION INTERVIEWS 
I'M JOINED BY NICK CLEGG WHO IS 
LEADING HIS PARTY ON A BIG ELECTION 
DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WAS 
CALLED CALAMITY CLEGG BY GORDON 
BROWN IN THE COMMONS TODAY 
WELL THE LAST TIME THESE SEATS 
WERE FOUGHT IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WAS A HIGH 
WATER MARK FOR THE LIB DEMS THEY 
MADE A NET GAIN OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN SEATS ON 
COUNCILS ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
BUT IN THE LAST TWO LOCAL 
ELECTIONS THE LIB DEMS HAVE BEEN 
LOSING SEATS ALMOST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY LAST YEAR 
WHEN THEY WERE TOTALLY WIPED NOUGHT 
A NUMBER OF COUNCIL AREAS IN THESE 
CIRCUMSTANCES AND WITH A NEW AND 
UNTESTED LEADER IT IS PERHAPS NOT 
SURPRISING THIS YEAR THEY ARE 
MAKING NO PREDICTIONS SO WHAT ARE 
THE KEY ELECTION BATTLEGROUNDS FOR 
THE LIB 
DEMS WELL THEY ARE 
DEFENDING COUNCILS THEY CONTROL 
LIKE NEWCASTLE AND LIVERPOOL WHICH 
HAS BEEN A KEY LABOUR TARGET THEY 
WILL BE LOOKING TO RECAPTURE 
COUNCILS THEY LOST RECENTLY LIKE SAINT 
ALBANS AND HULL TAKE COUNCILS LIKE 
WARRINGTON AND CARDIFF FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN LONDON THEY WILL BE 
HOPING THAT BRIAN PADDICK IMPROVES 
ON SIMON HUGHES PERFORMANCE DESPITE 
HIGH PROFILE LABOUR AND TORY 
CANDIDATES WHAT ARE THE KEY ISSUES 
THEY CLAIM LIB DEM RUN COUNCILS 
OFFER BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY LOWER 
COUNCIL TAXES THAN THEIR POLITICAL 
RIVALS LIKE THE TORIES THEY HAVE 
BEEN CAMPAIGNING HARD ON THE 
ENVIRONMENT THEY SAY THEY ARE THE 
ONLY PARTY PREPARED TO MAKE THE 
TOUGH DECISIONS THEIR ANTI NUCLEAR 
POWER PRO GREEN TAXES AND THEY 
HAVE BEEN MAKING CAPITAL FROM 
GOVERNMENT CONFUSION OVER THE TEN P. 
TAX RATE WITH CALLS FOR A FAIRER 
TAX SYSTEM SCRAPPING COUNCIL TAX 
AND REPLACING IT WITH LOCAL INCOME TAX 
NICK CLEGG WELCOME 
GOOD TO BE HERE 
IT USED TO BE SAID ABOUT YOUR PARTY 
NICE PARTY BUT INFECTUAL HAVING 
DESPATCHED COUPLE OF LEADERS IN 
SO MANY YEARS IT IS SOMETIMES SAID 
YOU ARE NASTY UNDER UNINN EFFECTUAL 
WERE IT WORTH IT ALL 
WE CERTAINLY 
AREN'T INFECTUAL I'VE BEEN 
CRISSCROSSING THE COUNTRY L. WAS IN 
LIVERPOOL TODAY HULL NEWCASTLE 
I'VE BEEN IN PORTSMOUTH IN ALL THE 
AREAS WHERE WE ARE MAKING AN 
IMPRESSION RESIDENTS TELL ME THEY 
ARE PLEASED THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
ARE DELIVERING CLEANER STREETS 
LET'S TAKE BACK TO THE ISSUE 
LIVERPOOL YOU MAKE GREAT PLAY OF 
THIS GREAT FLAGSHIP LIVERPOOL WAS 
DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE WORST IN 
THE COUNCIL BY THE AUDIT COMMISSION 
THEY HAD A SEVERE CRITICISM ABOUT 
WHAT THEY CALL RESOURCES WE GOT 
THREE OR FOUR STARS FOR EDUCATION 
FOR YOUTH SERVICE FOR BENEFITS IF 
YOU ASK PEOPLE AS I DID THIS 
AFTERNOON LIFRPUDLEE A. N. S. DO YOU 
THINK THE GREAT CITY OF LIVERPOOL 
IS A BETTER CITY NOW AFTER TEN 
YEARS OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
BEING IN POWER COMPARED WITH THE 
IMENT COUNCIL WE INHERITED WHEN WE 
TOOK OVER FROM LABOUR EVERY 
LIVERPUDLIAN WILL TELL YOU THEY ARE 
PROUD EVERYONE 
ALL THE ONES I EVERYONE MET 
ONE STAFF ARE HANDLING THE MET MONEY HANDLING THE MONEY IS WHAT 
POLITICS IS ABOUT 
IT IS NOT ONLY 
IF YOU SPEND MORE THAN YOU RAISE 
YOU ARE IN REAL TROUBLE 
THE OFSTED 
INSPECTION OF THE LOCAL EDUCATION 
AUTHORITY IN LIVERPOOL WAS ONE OF 
THE WORSE IN THE COUNTRY IT IS 
RATED AS ONE OF THE BEST BENEFIT 
SYSTEM GOT THREE STAR RATING THE 
THINGS THAT MATTER TO PEOPLE FRONT 
LINE SERVICES HAVE BEEN DELIVERED 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT COUNCIL IN 
LIVERPOOL THAT BLOCKED OFF 
ALLEYWAYS BEHIND PEOPLE'S 
WHICH LED TO THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT DROP IN BURGLARY 
IN A YEAR 
I WANT TO TACKLE YOU 
ABOUT LEADERSHIP WHAT WAS THE 
POINT OF GETTING RID OF MENZIES 
CAMPBELL WHEN YOUR PERSONAL 
SATISFACTION RATINGS ARE WERE LOWER 
THAN MENZIES CAMPBELL WHEN HE LEFT 
I HAVE BEEN IN THE JOB FOR FOUR OR 
FIVE MONTHS 
IT HAS GONE DOWN OUR OUR PARTY POLL RATING AS AN AVERAGE IS 
THREE POINTS HIGHER NOW THAN IT WAS 
WHEN I TOOK OVER 
WITH CREDIT 
CRUNCH WITH PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT 
HOMES WAR IN IRAQ AND WAR IN 
REFUGEE AFGHANISTAN 
THERE IS 
ANOTHER OTHER TIME IN THE LAST FOUR 
OR FIVE PARLIAMENT'S THAT THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN AROUND 
TWENTY PER CENT AS WE ARE AT THE MOMENT EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY FIVE TWENTY PER CENT WAS THE LAST OPINION POLL ON 
SUNDAY OUR AVERAGE IS BELOW TWENTY PER CENT 
THAT IS FOUR OR FIVE POINTS HIGHER 
THAN THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HAVE 
EVER BEEN TWO OR THREE YEARS DUE DUE TO YOUR LEADERSHIP 
NO TO DESCRIBE 
THAT AS A DISAPPOINTMENT IS FACTLY 
NOT RIGHT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT 
PROGRESS A FEW MONTHS AGO WHE WERE 
THIRTEEN PERCENT A BASE TO BUILD IT 
TAKES ME AS A NEW LEADER TIME TO 
INTRODUCE MYSELF TO THE BRITISH 
PUBLIC WHAT WILL BE CRUCIAL OVER 
THE NEXT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE 
GENERAL ELECTION THAT I TALK ABOUT 
THINGS PEOPLE CARE ABOUT FAIRNESS 
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY THAT HAS 
SUBSTANCE 
ON LEADERSHIP YOU MUST SUBSTANCE LUR SURELY REGRET DISCUSSING YOUR 
SEX LIFE 
YOU WORK IN THE MEDIA 
FOUR OR FIVE WORK WORDS YOU UTTER 
IN CONTEXT GET REPEATED OVER 
INTERPRETED 
GORDON BROWN WOULD NOT INTERPRETED HAVE TALKED ABOUT HIS SCKUAL 
PARTNERS DAVID CAMERON WOULDN'T 
I WILL NOT START REINVENTING OR 
TRYING TO BE WISE WITH HINDSIGHT I 
WANT TO MOVE ON IF I HAVE ANY 
REGRETS IT SHOULD SERVE AS 
DISTRACTION THAT THINGS THAT 
BROUGHT ME INTO POLITICS I CARE 
ABOUT WHY ARE RETRASHING CIVIL LIB 
RITZ 
LET'S GO ON TO SOME OF THESE RITZ ISSUES YOU WANT A RETURN TO THE 
FUEL DUTY ESCALATOR PETROL IS 
ABOUT FIVE A GALLON YOU WANT PEOPLE 
TOLL PAY MORE FOR PETROL AT THE 
PUMPS 
THEY ARE ANY WAY IF YOU PUMPS WANT AN ESCALATOR WHETHER THAT IS 
CREATED THROUGH MARKET FORCES WHICH 
IS THE REASON 
WE HAVE GOT AN 
ESCALATOR IT'S NOT CAUSED BY YOU 
WOULD YOU INSTITUTE A FUEL 
ESCALATOR THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD 
IMPOSE 
IF FUEL PRICES SUDDENLY 
DROPPED THROUGH THE FLOOR IN A WAY 
I DON'T THINK THEY WILL OPEC IS 
PREDICTING A PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A BARREL 
IF THEY WERE TO FALL THROUGH THE 
FLOOR I WOULD WANT TO CREATE A 
SYSTEM WHERE THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
AFFECTS OF TRANSPORT OF FUEL POWER 
TRANSPORT SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN 
THE COST OF THAT WILL FUEL THAT IS 
THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE IS 
ONE WE ARE TRYING TO ENSHRINE 
BRIAN PADDICK WHO COULD BE RUNNING 
LONDON BY THE WEEKEND IS AGAINST 
THE TWENTY FIVE CONGESTION CHARGE 
HE IS 
AGAINST THE TWENTY FIVE CHARGE ASK HIM IF 
YOU WISH HE LOOKED AT THE DETAIL 
AND DISCOVERED THERE ARE ARE SO 
MANY EXEMPTIONS THAT CONGESTION 
WOULD BE WORSENED HE IS ADVOCATING 
A PERIMETER CHARGE TO STOP THE CAR 
COMMUTING OR LESSEN IT IN AND OUT 
OF LONDON 
THE MATTER YOU RAISED 
TODAY POST OFFICE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
CARE ABOUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND 
WITH FOUR MILLION FEWER PEOPLE 
USING THE POST OFFICES FOR YOU TO 
SAY YOU SHOULD KEEP THEM DOESN'T 
MAKE SENSE ECONOMICLY DOES IT MY MY VIEW IS THAT THE REASON WHY THERE 
ARE FEWER PEOPLE GOING INTO POST 
OFFICES IS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS HAM STRUNG THE POST OFFICE IT 
HASN'T ALLOWED THEM TO PROVIDE NEW 
SERVICES FINANCIAL SERVICES AND 
OTHERS 
WE DON'T NEED THE POST OFFICES WE 
USED TO YOU CAN'T SUBSIDISE EVERY 
POST OFFICE 
WHAT YOU COULD DO YOU 
SPLIT OFF ROYAL MAIL OUR PLAN 
THIS IS OUR PLAN YOU WOULD FLOAT 
JUST UNDER HALF OF THAT ROYAL MAIL 
COMPANY THAT WOULD RACE TWO MILLION 
WE WOULD PLOUGH THAT INTO THE POST 
OFFICE NETWORK THE CONSERVATIVES 
AND LABOUR HAVE TOGETHER DECIMATED 
ABOUT OVER A THIRD OF THE POST 
OFFICE NETWORK THE LAST 
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT CLOSED 
THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIS GOVERNMENT CLOSED OVER 
FIVE THOUSAND I CAN TELL YOU I'VE BEEN TO 
SO MANY COMMUNITIES IT RIPS THE 
HEART OUT OF SOME COMMUNITIES 
TOMORROW IS A BIG DAY FOR YOU 
ISN'T IT DO YOU EXPECT TO BE 
TREATED WITH THE SAME RUTHLESSNESS 
YOUR TWO PREDECESSORS WERE IF YOU 
ARE NOT UP TO IT 
I'M IN FOR THE 
LONG TERM 
THEY WERE THERE FOR THE LONG TERM LONG TERM TOO 
MY WHOLE PARTY 
UNDERSTANDS WE ARE EMBARKED UPON A 
STRATEGY TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF 
M. P.'S IN WESTMINSTER THESE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS ARE IMPORTANT AS THE 
NAME IMPLIES LOCAL ELECTIONS THEY 
ARE DRIVEN BY LOCAL ISSUES AND 
LOCAL DEMANDS BY LOCAL PEOPLE AS 
THEY SHOULD BE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
GORDON BROWN DAVID CAMERON AND OF 
COURSE NICK CLEGG THEY FACE BIG 
TESTS TOMORROW AT THE BALLOT BOX 
TODAY HAS BEEN A BUSY DAY 
ON LONDON WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL 
HAPPEN FIFPLT YOU TALK TO THE MAIN 
PARTY THE TWO BIG PARTIES 
CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR THEY BOTH 
SAY IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL IT IS 
CLOSE IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT 
ELECTION TO CALL THIS 
IS IT A 
QUESTION OF TURNOUT A BIGGER 
TURNOUT TO FAVOUR KEN LIVINGSTONE 
WILL CONSERVATIVES BE INCLINED TO 
VOTE THAN LABOUR PEOPLE IT IS 
CLEAR THESE CONTENDERS HAVE BIG 
PERSONAL VOTES FROM PEOPLE WHO 
WON'T NECESSARILY VOTE FOR THEIR 
PARTIES THERE'S THE ETHNIC 
MINORITY VOTES AND THE WHOLE ISSUE 
OF SECOND PERFORMANCES L. WAS 
TALKING TO KEN LIVINGSTONE TONIGHT 
AND HE SAYS HE THINKS HE'S STILL 
NARROWLY AHEAD AND THAT HE WILL WIN 
I WAS WITH A GROUP OF COLLEAGUES 
AND ONE OF THE MISCHIEVOUSLY ASKED 
HIM WHAT HE WAS PLANNING TO DO 
AFTER HE WAS MAYOR BE THAT IN A 
FEW DAYS' TIME OR YEARS' TIME HE 
SAID HE WOULD BRING OUT MEMOIRS AND 
JOIN TONY BLAIR ON THE LECTURE 
CIRCUIT I PUT IT TO HIM THAT HE 
WOULD GET TEN THOUSAND A THROW THEN HE 
SAID I'LL DO IT ONCE A FORTNIGHT 
BUT IT IS NOT A CAREER MOVE HE IS 
PLANNING 
THERE WAS A BIT OF PUNCH PLANNING AND JUDY IN THE COMMONS IT WAS AN 
INTERESTING DAY 
IT WAS AN 
INTELLIGENT EXCHANGE ON THE 
GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSAL TO INTRODUCE 
UP TO FORTY TWO DETENTION FOR SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS AT ONE POINT GORDON 
BROWN MISTAKENLY SAID FORTY EIGHT DAYS AND 
THE ARGUMENTS WENT ON TOWARDS THE 
END IT GOT MORE PUNCH AND JUDY AS 
WE KEEP SAYING WHEN DAVID CAMERON 
BROUGHT UP THE FACT THAT GORDON 
BROWN ON RADIO FOUR ADMITTED HE MADE 
MISTAKES OVER THE ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
TODAY APPARENTLY HE'S ADMITTING 
MISTAKES WHY DOESN'T HE ADMIT THE 
BIGGEST MISTAKE OF ALL W. WHICH HE 
PUTS POLITICAL CALCULATION AND 
SELF INTEREST HE IS PUTTING 
POLITICAL CALCULATION AND SELF 
INTEREST AHEAD OF THE RIGHT 
DECISIONS AHEAD OF THE NATIONAL 
INTEREST 
THIS IS A MAN WHO WANTS INTEREST TO BE BOTH TOUGH ON CRIME AND HUG A 
HOODY AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS A 
MAN WHERE POLITICAL CALCULATION 
MEANT HE CYCLE TODAY WORK BUT HAD 
THE CHAUFFEUR DRIVEN CAR BEHIND HE 
WAS A SHALLOW SALESMAN AND NEVER 
ADDRESSES THE SUBSTANCE OF THE 
ISSUE 
THAT WAS INTERESTING ISSUE THERE'S NEWS TODAY WHAT COULD BE A 
TEST FOR THE CONSERVATIVES INDEED INDEED THREE WEEKS AFTER TOMORROW'S 
ELECTIONS WE NOW KNOW THE CREWE 
BY ELECTION WILL BE HELD ON 
THURSDAY TWENTY SECOND OF MAY THE WRIT WAS 
MOVED TODAY BY THE LABOUR PARTY 
NOW THIS IS A BIG TEST FOR DAVID 
CAMERON REALLY IN THAT TO WIN THE 
SEAT THEY ONLY NEED A SWING OF EIGHT PER CENT 
AND GUN WOODY HAS EIGHT PER CENT SO LABOUR IS 
THOUGHT TO LOSE THEY'RE HOPING TO 
FORM THE NEXT GOVERNMENT NOW IN 
TODAY CONSERVATIVE M. P.'S AND CERTAIN 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WERE SAYING IT 
WAS RATHER UNSEEMLY OF THE LABOUR 
PARTY TO MOVE THE WRIT SO QUICKLY 
WHEN IN FACT GWYNETH DUNWOODY'S 
FUNERAL IS NEXT THURSDAY THIS WAS 
DONE WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE 
FAMILY AND LABOUR PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING IT IS A BIT RICH FOR THE LIB 
DEMS TO MAKE THE ACCUSATION WHEN 
THEY'RE MOVING CAMPAIGN PEOPLE INTO 
THE CONSTITUENCY ALREADY AND 
INDEED HAVE RATHER QUICKLY AND 
RUTHLESSLY REPLACED THEIR CANDIDATE

OLGA WAS GIVEN POLITICAL ASYLUM IN

BAIL CONDITIONS THEIR APPLICATIONS 
FOR ASYLUM ARE CONSIDERED BY THE 
UKRAINIAN AUTHORITIES AND THEIR 
HOPE IS THAT HISS VERY ON THEIR 
SIDE IS ON THEIR SIDE THIS IS 
THE EVENT THAT CHANGED UKRAINE 
THE ORANGE REVOLUTION EMBODIED THE 
COUNTRY'S ATTEMPT TO BREAK AWAY 
FROM THE PAST AND FROM ITS 
NEIGHBOUR RUSSIA NEARLY THREE 
AND A HALF YEARS AGO AFTER WEEKS 
OF 
POPULAR PROTEST HE BECAME POPULAR PRESIDENT SINCE THEN THE 
TWO COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN IN ALMOST 
CONSTANT STATE OF CONFLICT OVER 
GAS SUPPLIES AND UKRAINE'S 
AMBITIONS TO JOIN NATO LITTLE 
WONDER THEN THAT THE AUTHORITIES 
HERE ARE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO PROVIDE 
A HOME FOR CRITICS OF THE KREMLIN 
UKRAINE IS CURRENTLY HOST TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY 
RECOGNISED REFUGEES FROM THE 
RUSSIAN FEDERATION BUT THOSE ARE 
JUST THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN GRANTED 
OFFICIAL ASYLUM THERE ARE 
COUNTLESS OTHERS WHO FOR ONE 
REASON OR ANOTHER SIMPLY NO LONGER 
FEEL SAFE IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY 
AND THEY'RE NOT ALL POLITICAL 
ACTIVISTS THERE ARE CHECHENS AND 
JOURNALISTS ARTISTS AND 
BUSINESSMEN THIS MAN IS FROM 
MOSCOW AND HE'S IN CONSTRUCTION 
ONLY HE DOESN'T LIVE IN RUSSIA ANY 
MORE IN JANUARY LAST YEAR HE FLED 
TO UKRAINE FEARING ARREST THE THE SCARY THING IS UN PREDICTABILITY 
YOU CAN'T ANTICIPATE IT SO YOU 
CAN'T PREPARE FOR T. IN NORMAL 
SOCIETY THE PROCESS PROCESS IS 
CLEAR IF YOU COMMITTED A CRIME 
THEY'LL COME FOR YOU IN RUSSIA IT 
CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE YOU DON'T 
NEED TO HAVE DONE ANYTHING WRONG 
WE PUT THE ALLEGATION ESSENTIALLY 
THAT THE LAW IN RUSSIA IS APPLIED 
SELECTIVELY AND RANDOMLY TO THE 
RUSSIAN EMBASSY HERE THEY TOLD US 
THESE MISTAKES CAN HAPPEN BUT 
THEY'RE NOT SEEMIC NOW IT YOU'RE A 
RUSSIAN WHO NEEDS TO LEAVE THE 
COUNTRY IN A HURRY THERE'S ONE 
THING THAT MAKES UKRAINE A 
PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE DESTINATION 
THAT'S IT IS JUST NEXT DOOR AND IT 
IS NOT THAT HARD TO GET IN WITH A 
RUSSIAN PASSPORT YOU DON'T NEED A 
VISA TO CROSS AT BORDER POST LIKE 
THIS ONE EVEN IF UDS' RATHER AVOID 
THE CHECKPOINTS BECAUSE THERE'S AN 
ARREST WARRANT OUT FOR YOU THERE 
ARE STILL WAYS OF GETTING ACROSS 
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO HELP 
STAN NOT HIS REAL NAME IS ONE SUCH 
PERSON SOMETIMES HE DEALS IN GOODS 
AND FUEL BUT HE HAS ON OCCASION 
SMUGGLED RUSSIANS ACROSS THE BORDER 
WHEN THEY'VE BEEN ON THE RUN 
THERE ARE MANY LITTLE VILLAGES ALONG THE BORDER YOU CAN 
TO GET A PERSON OUT THERE ARE 
CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES BUT MONEY 
DECIDES EVERYTHING IN THIS DAY AND 
AGE 
ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS THE PRICE HE QUOTED AGE ME ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED 
BUT IT IS IN THIS OFFICE THAT YOU 
THEN HAVE TO BATTLE WITH 
BUREAUCRACY IF YOU WANT TO GET 
ASYLUM IN UKRAINE 
THIS WOMAN IS FROM UZBEKISTAN 
SHE'S BEEN WAITING FOR HER REFUGEE 
STATUS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE SHE TOLD ME IN 
YOU'RE RUSSIAN THE WHOM PROGRESSS 
CAN EASIER AND QUICKER SAFELY 
TUCKED AWAY IN HIS OFFICE IN THE 
BACK ROOM IS THE MANAGER OF THIS 
IMMIGRATION CENTRE 
THE VERY FACT THAT ALMOST EVERY APPLICANT FROM RUSSIA 
IS ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH THE 
PROCEDURE AND THEIR CASE IS SEEN 
CLOSELY THIS INDICATES UKRAINE IS 
FULFILLING ITS COMMITMENTS TO 
EUROPE AND THE WHOLE WORLD IN THE 
FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION 
BUT THERE'S POLITICS AT PLAY HERE 
TOO BACK IN THIS TOWN THE LAWYER 
IS WORRIED HIS CLIENTS COULD FALL 
VICTIM TO THE SHIFTING AND UNEASY 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RUSSIA AND 
UKRAINE UKRAINE SHOULD I BE ON THAT PLACE L. 
WOULDN'T BE SO OPTIMISTIC FOR 
GETTING A REAL PROTECTION IN 
UKRAINE IT IS QUITE EASY TO 
IMAGINE THAT THE STATE OF UKRAINE 
WOULD LET'S SAY TRADE THESE PEOPLE 
FOR SOMETHING FOR INSTANCE FOR 
THE PRICE OF GAS 
OLGA IS STUDYING 
TO CONTINUE HER EDUCATION HERE IN 
UKRAINE UKRAINE UKRAINE CAN USE OLGA TO TRUMPET 
ITS HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD TO EUROPE 
AND TO POKE THE FINGER AT RUSSIA 
IT IS AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SUITS 
BOTH SIDES FOR THE TIME BEING AT 
LEAST BEFORE WE GO LET'S HAVE A 
LOOK AT TOMORROW'S FRONT PAGES 
THEY'RE FAIRLY A MIXED BAG 
TIMES 
THEY'RE FAIRLY A MIXED BAG TIMES HAS THE POLITICAL STORY BROWN 
PLOTS FIGHT BACK AS VOTERS GIVE 
VERDICT 
FINANCIAL TIMES BANK SIGNALS WORST 
IS OVER 
GUARDIAN HAS POLICE REJECT TOUGHER 
ACTION ON CANNABIS THE BROWN PLAN 
TO UPGRADE THE DRUG WILL NOT CHANGE 
CONFISCATED AND WARN STANCE BUT AT 
THE BOTTOM THERE INTERESTING STORY 
WHICH MEANS BACTERIA THRIVE ON 
COMPUTER KEYBOARD THEY CAN BE 
DIRTIER THAN THE AVERAGE TOILET 
SEAT THE DAILY MAIL HAS MILKING 
THE MOTORIST 
INDY HAS WANTED THE LAST NAZIS 
ACCUSED THE WORST CRIMES IN THE 
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
TIMELY THE TELEGRAPH HAS A STORY 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BAIL HOSTELS BUILD IN SECRET 
I'M AFRAID MY COPY IS TOO SMALL TO 
SEE THE DETAIL THAT'S ALL FROM THE 
NEWSNIGHT TOMORROW KIRSTY IS HERE 
WITH POLLING STATIONS CLOSED WHICH 
THE TIME WE GO ON AIR WE WILL HAVE 
COMPREHENSIVE REPORTS ON THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS GOOD NIGHT

MAY BUT THE APRIL SHOWERS ARE 
GOING TO CONTINUE FOR A WHILE YET A 
FAIRLY DAMP NIGHT ACROSS SCOTLAND

RAIN WILL EASE WILL YOU THE COURSE 
OF THE DAY PLENTY MORE SHOWERS 
POPPING UP ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND

ENGLAND AND WALES WE WILL SEE THE 
HEAVIER SHOWERS BREWING UP THROUGH

SUNSHINE BETWEEN THE SHOWERS SIXTEEN 
DEGREES IT SHOULD FEEL REASONABLY
