GOOD AFTERNOON 
PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE HAS 
LAUNCHED A STINGING ATTACK ON 
GORDON BROWN OVER THE CONTINUING 
ELECTIONS CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE AFTER 
THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT THE 
WORLD'S PATIENCE WAS WEARING THIN 
PRESIDENT MUGABE LABELLED HIM A 
TINY LITTLE DOT ON THIS WORLD 
THE COMMENTS COME TWO WEEKS TO THE 
DAY AFTER THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE 
WENT TO THE POLLS BUT THERE IS 
STILL NO RESULT 
THIS WEEKEND SOUTHERN AFRICAN LEAD 
REMEMBERS MEETING IN ZAMBIA TO TRY 
TO FIND A SOLUTION BUT MR. MUGABE 
IS NOT ATTENDING 
LET'S GO LIVE TO LUSAKA THE 
ZAMBIAN CAPITAL TO OUR 
CORRESPONDENT ALLAN LITTLE 
IT WAS NOT THE HAPPIEST OF MISSIONS 
BUT DUTYFULLY THABO MBEKI STOPPED 
IN HARARE TO MAKE ONE LAST ATTEMPT 
TO BRING ROBERT MUGABE TO THE 
SUMMIT IT FAILED BOTH KNOW THAT 
IT'S NOT ONLY AFRICA THAT IS 
WATCHING THEM MR. MUGABE SEES THE 
HAND OF THE OLD COLONIAL POWER 
BRITAIN AT WORK EVERYWHERE TODAY 
GORDON BROWN MADE SURE THAT HE 
WOULD ONCE AGAIN BE THE UNSEEN 
UNWANTED GUEST AT THE TABLE 
THIS IS A COMPLETELY INTOLERABLE 
SITUATION IT'S NOW TIME THAT 
HAVING HAD AN ELECTION THE 
DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS OF ZIMBABWE ARE 
NOW RESPECTED ANY INTIMIDATION 
ANY VIOLENCE IS COMPLETELY 
UNACCEPTABLE I THINK THE WHOLE 
EYES OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
ARE NOW UPON ZIMBABWE WE ARE 
LOOKING FOR ACTION 
MR. MUGABE WAS BOUND TO RESENT THAT 
HE ACCUSED BRITAIN OF HIJACKING THE 
LUSAKA SUMMIT THAT TOO HE SAID 
WOULD FAIL 
BROWN IS THE WORLD SURE THE WORLD 
IS LOSING PATIENCE BUT I KNOW 
BROWN IS A LITTLE TINY DOT ON THIS 
WORLD WORLD TWO WEEKS AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION THERE IS STILL NO RESULT 
THE OPPOSITION SAY THE FIGURES HAVE 
BEEN COOKED TO STRIP THEM OF THEIR 
VICTORY THEY SAY THEY WILL NOT 
TAKE PART IN A SECOND ROUND RUN OFF 
SOUTH AFTERIA'S PRESIDENT TODAY 
ROBERT MUGABE'S SIDE IN THAT 
DISPUTE 
THE LAW SAYS THERE SHOULD DISPUTE BE A SECOND ROUND WHAT IS WHAT IS 
HAPPENING I WOULDN'T DESCRIBE THAT 
AS A CRISIS 
NO CRISIS IS NOT WHAT 
THE M. D. C. CAME HERE HOPING TO HEAR 
THEY WANTED THE VOICE OF AFRICA TO 
TELL ROBERT MUGABE TO GO 
CLEARLY THAT IS NOT GOING TO 
HAPPEN HAPPEN WE ARE NOT HEAR THE ZAMBIAN 
PRESIDENT SAID TO PUT MUGABE IN 
THE DOCK 
IN HARARE MR. MUGABE'S SUPPORTERS 
SAY THE PRESIDENT HAS REFUSED TO 
COME TO THIS MEETING BECAUSE IT'S 
NOT NECESSARY AND THERE IS NO 
CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE BY REFUSING TO 
BE HERE MR. MUGABE IS SIGNALLING TO 
HIS FELLOW AFRICAN LEADERS THAT AS 
FAR AS HE IS CONCERNED IT'S NONE 
OF THEIR BUSINESS 
THAT WAS ALLAN LITTLE LET'S TALK 
NOW TO OUR WORLD AFFAIRS 
CORRESPONDENT PETER GRESTE WHO IS 
FOLLOWING EVENTS IN JOHANNESBURG 
PETER ANY SENSE THAT ANYTHING CAN 
BE ACHIEVED FROM AN SADC MEETING 
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE EASIER TO 
SAY WHAT WON'T BE ACHIEVED AS 
ALLAN SAID THAT WON'T BE THE 
RESIGNATION OF ROBERT MUGABE OR THE 
DEPARTURE OF ZANU P. F. THERE THIS 
SUMMIT IS GOING TO TRY AND FIND A 
SOLUTION THAT ANSWERS OR RESPONDS 
TO THE MOOD OF THE PEOPLE IN 
ZIMBABWE I THINK THE BEST THAT THE 
OPPOSITION CAN HOPE FOR THAT THE 
OPPOSITION LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
CAN HOPE FOR IS SOME COOLING OF 
THE POLITICAL TEMPERATURE HE HAS 
SAID THAT HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT 
RETURNING TO ZIMBABWE HE IS 
CONCERNED FOR HIS OWN SAFETY WE'VE 
SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS AN 
INCREASING POLARISATION OF THE TWO 
SIDES AN ENTRENCHING OF THEIR 
POSITIONS AND INCREASINGLY 
AGGRESSIVE RHETORIC BOTH SIDES 
ACCUSING THE OTHER OF PREPARING FOR 
SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL FIGHT IF THE 
SUMMIT CAN FIND A SOLUTION CAN 
FIND A WAY OF EASING THE POLITICAL 
TEMPERATURE TO THE POINT WHERE THEY 
CAN GO FORWARD WITH WHAT SEEMS TO 
ALMOST CERTAINLY TO BE SECOND 
ROUND OF ELECTIONS IN WHICH THE 
OPPOSITION WILL TAKE PART THEN I 
THINK THIS SUMMIT WILL BE DEEMED TO 
BE A SUCCESS 
PETER GRESTE IN JOHANNESBURG 
THANK YOU 
HERE A WOMAN WHO NEEDS A KIDNEY 
TRANSPLANT HAS BEEN REFUSED HER 
DEAD DAUGHTER'S ORGANS OFFICIALS 
AT THE HUMAN TISSUE AUTHORITY 
REJECTED LAURA ASHWORTH'S WISH THAT 
HER KIDNEYS BE GIVE ON TO HER 
MOTHER BECAUSE SHE HAD NOT BEGUN 
THE FORMAL PROSELLS OF BECOMING A 
LIVING DONOR HER ORGANS WERE 
DONATED TO STRANGERS RAYMOND 
BUCHANAN REPORTS 
TO RACHEL LEAKE IMAGES LIKE THIS 
ARE NOW MORE PRECIOUS THAN EVER 
HER TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER SUFFERED A 
FATAL ASTHMA ATTACK AT THE FAMILY 
HOME JUST A FORTNIGHT AGO 
BUT IT WAS HOPED LAURA'S DEATH 
COULD ALLOW HER MOTHER TO PROLONG 
HER LIFE 
RACHEL HAS ALREADY HAD ONE FAILED 
KIDNEY TRANSPLANT AND IS WAITING 
FOR ANOTHER DONOR HER DAUGHTER HAD 
TOLD FRIENDS IF ANYTHING EVER 
HAPPENED TO HER SHE WOULD LIKE TO 
BE THAT DONOR 
IT'S WHAT LAURA WANTED YOU KNOW 
SHE WANTED TO HELP ME 
I DID MENTION THIS TO THE 
TRANSPLANT CO ORDINATOR BUT SHE 
CAME BACK TO ME AND SHE SAID THAT 
THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW IT LAURA WAS A 
MATCH BUT THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW IT 
BECAUSE OF THE LAW 
BUT ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY THERE IS A LONG WAITING 
LIST FOR DONATIONS AND THE RULES 
WHICH GOVERN THAT LIST ARE CLEAR 
YOU CAN'T NOMINATE RECIPIENTS IF 
YOU DECIDE TO DONATE A KIDNEY 
WHILST YOU ARE STILL ALIVE YOU CAN 
NOMINATE RECIPIENTS 
IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO VARY THE 
NORMAL RULES OF MEETING URGENT 
CLINICAL NEED BUT THE AUTHORITIES 
SIMILARLY VERY ANXIOUS NOT TO SAY 
YES TO CERTAIN CASES WITHOUT FULLY 
CONSIDERING THE IMPLICATIONS MORE 
WIDELY WIDELY LAURA ASHWORTH'S FAMILY ARE 
COMFORTED THAT THREE OTHER PEOPLE 
BENEFITED FROM HER ORGANS 
THEY JUST WISH ONE OF THEM COULD 
HAVE BEEN HER MOTHER 
DOCTORS ARE WARNING THAT THE LARGE 
MEASURES OF ALCOHOL NOW BEING 
SERVED IN SOME PUBS ARE ENCOURAGING 
PEOPLE TO DRINK TOO MUCH THE 
LICENSING INDUSTRY SAYS IT'S 
OFFERING CHOICE AND THAT 
SUPERSIZING IS LEER TO STAY THE 
ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS THOUGH 
SAYS BARS ARE OFFERING LARGE 
MEASURES AS A STANDARD SIZE WHICH 
MEANS PEOPLE JUST DON'T REALISE HOW 
MUCH THEY'RE DRINKING 
PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF UNITS THEY 
WANT TO STAY WITHIN SAFE LIMITS 
BUT THEY'RE BEING PUSHED UP WAY 
OVER SAFE LIMITS BY NOT REALISING 
WHAT THEY'RE DRINKING THINK IT 
IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND THE INDUSTRY 
HAS TO PUT ITS HOUSE IN ORDER
