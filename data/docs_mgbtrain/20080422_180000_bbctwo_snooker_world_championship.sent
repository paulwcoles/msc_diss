THAT IS THE MATCH 
WE'RE GOING TO STICK WITH AND THE 
COMMENTARY BOX WE SAY 
GOOD EVENING 
TO WILLIE THORNE AND JOHN VIRGO THE MATCH COULD NOT BE POISED BETTER OR AT FIVE TO FOUR TO DING JUNHUI IT IS ALL TO PLAY FOR THIS EVENING FIRST TO TEN REMEMBER AND WHAT A SESSION IT WAS THAT 
FIRST SESSION THE STANDARD WAS TOP 
DRAWER THE LOWEST BREAK IN THE 
LAST SIX FRAMES WERE SEVENTY EIGHT 
WHEN A DING JUNHUI LEAD FIVE TO ONE YOU 
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A 
RUNAWAY VICTORY BUT MARCO FU CAME 
AT RIGHT BACK INTO THIS MATCH 
LISTENING TO THOSE STATISTICS AND 
THE BREAKS YOU RATTLED OFF IT'S 
SUGGESTED BOTH OF THESE PLAYERS ARE 
TREMENDOUS PORTERS AND BREAK 
BUILDERS IT COULD BECOME A SCRAPPY 
GAME WHICH COULD DETERMINE WHO WINS 
THIS FIRST ROUND MATCH THE STRANGE 
THING WITH DING JUNHUI IT WAS ONLY 
A COUPLE OF SEASONS AGO WHEN HE WON 
THE U. K. CHAMPIONSHIP THAT EVERYONE 
EARMARKED HIM AS A POTENTIAL WORLD 
CHAMPION HE HAS GONE UNDER THE 
RADAR IN THIS TOURNAMENT THE THE TURNING POINT WAS THE MASTERS AT 
WEMBLEY WHEN HE LOST AT THE SEMI 
FINAL HE THOUGHT THAT THE CROWD 
WERE CHEERING ON RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
AND SPORTINGLY AND IT WAS NOT THE 
CASE HE WAS SO UPSET ABOUT THINGS 
AND SINCE THEN HE HAS NOT PRODUCED 
THE GOODS WE KNOW HE CAN YES FAIR OBSERVATION 
EVEN BEFORE THE CUE BALL FINISHED 
ROLLING MARCO FU KNEW THAT IN JUNE 
HE HAD PLAYED A GOOD SHOT DING 
JUNHUI AS LONG AS YOU GET THE CUE 
BALL BACK TO THAT SORT OF AREA 
WHERE IT IS NOW NEXT TO THE WILL 
THE YELLOW 
HE HAS HAD THE RESULT THERE 
BECAUSE HE HAS KISSED THE YELLOW 
FIN THAT IS ACTUALLY A GOOD SAFETY 
SHOT WE SHARE PLAYED THE GOOD 
SAFETY SHOT YOU CANNOT RISK 
PLAYING TOWARDS THE JAWS OF THE 
MIDDLE POCKET 
HE CAN SEE ENOUGH OF THIS RED TO 
SEND IT DOWN THE TABLE AND KEEP THE 
CUE BALL INTO THE BAULK END HE HAS 
GOT THE SNOOKER THAT COULD BE A 
TELLING SAFETY SHOT FROM BEEN JUNE 
THE DING 
UNTIL YOU GET SETTLED 
THE DING IT IS EASY TO OVERHIT THIS IF HE 
DOES THAT HE WILL LEAVE THE THIS 
RED OVER THE MIDDLE NOW HE'S 
COMING OFF TWO CUSHIONS RATHER 
THAN POOLE 
HE PLAYED IT WELL HE WAS LUCKY 
THAT HE CAUGHT THE BLUE JUST 
WONDERING IF THIS RED WILL GO INTO 
THE MIDDLE POCKET THEN HE WILL BE 
SCREWING THE CUE BALL BACK TO THE 
BAULK END HERE GOES 
IT WAS ALWAYS LOOKING LIKE A SHOT 
TO NOTHING THAT IS THE TYPE OF 
SURE YOU PLAY WERE THE ONLY BALL HE 
COULD LEAVE IS THE ONE YOU'RE A 
PLAYING AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT 
STAY IN THE JAWS OF THE POCKET YOU 
WOULD BE UNLUCKY TO LEAVE IT 
HE'S WORRIED THAT THE THIRD RED IN 
LINE THAT COULD BE PUSHED OVER THE 
RIGHT HAND CORNER 
BUT A GOOD 
TARGET OF GREEN BROWN AND BLUE TO 
GET IN BEHIND IT IS THE THIRD RED 
THAT HE'S WORRIED ABOUT 
IT HAS GONE OVER THE POCKET HAS HE 
COVERED THAT L. DON'T THINK HE HAS 
HE CAME DOWN AND HAD A LOOK AT 
EVERYTHING BUT HE HAS LEFT IT HE 
DOES NOT NEED TO DO LOT TO THE 
CUE BALL TO GET POSITION ON THE 
BLACK 
HE'S JUST DIDN'T CATCH THE MIDDLE 
OF THE POCKET THAT IS WHY HE 
DIDN'T GET THE CANNON 
IN HE'S A LITTLE DRAG SHOTS WHEN 
YOU PLAY THEM WITH SIDE SOMETIMES 
THEY CAN GO ALL ALONG GO WRONG 
LET'S SEE WHERE THE BLACK AS WIN 
THE IF HE'S OUT OF THE WAY HE 
COULD POT THIS RED AND THE BLACK 
GOES INTO THE LEFT CORNER SO THAT 
IS PERFECT THE ONE RED HE WOULD 
LIKE TO REMOVE IS THE ONE TO THE 
LEFT OF THE BLACK THAT WOULD MAKE 
THE BLACK AVAILABLE INTO BOTH 
CORNER POCKETS THIS IS REASONABLE CHANCE 
HE HAS GOT TO PLAY FOR THE CANNON 
ON THE RED TO THE LEFT OF THE BLACK 
NO PROBLEM NOW HE WILL CLEAR THE 
BLACK FOR BOTH CORNER POCKETS ON 
THE FIRST FRAME OF THE EVENING 
THERE IS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT OF 
NERVES IN THE CUEING ARM 
I TALKED TO MARCO FU THE OTHER DAY 
AND HIS COACH TERRY GRIFFITHS HE 
VERY RARELY PRACTISES WITH ANOTHER 
PLAYER PLAYS ON HIS OWN MOST OF 
THE TIME 
NOT MANY PLAYERS DO THAT 
THEY FIND IT EASIER TO PLAY WITH 
ANOTHER PLAYER SOMETIMES PLAY BEST 
OF NINE FOR A FIVE OR TEN THERE TO 
KEEP IT INTERESTING BUT MARK CO THE 
PRACTICE ROOM 
IS ALWAYS ON HIS 
OWN WITH TERRY GRIFFITHS HE LOOKED 
TO BE FADING DOWN THE RANKINGS A 
FEW SEASONS AGO BUT HE HAS DONE 
WELL WITH TERRY GRIFFITHS I'M 
IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY HE HAS 
PLAYED 
HE HAD TO QUALIFY TO GET PLAYED HERE THIS YEAR BUT I DON'T THINK 
HE WILL HAVE TO QUALIFY NEXT YEAR 
HE IS GOING UP THE RANKINGS 
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW DING JUNHUI 
PLAYS NOW HAVING LED FIVE TO ONE IT LOOKS 
LIKE IT WILL BE FIVE TO FIVE INTERESTING TO 
SEE HOW HE PLAYS HAVING HAD A FEW 
GOOD BREAKS HE HASN'T HAD A THIRTY 
BREAK IN THE NEXT LAST FOUR 
FRAMES 
THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION FRAMES OVER HIM WHETHER HE HAS THE 
TEMPERAMENT WHEN THINGS AREN'T 
GOING WELL FOR HIM 
ANOTHER COLOUR AND A RED WILL BE 
ENOUGH IT SHOWS YOU THE ADVANTAGE 
OF HAVING THE BLACK INTO BOTH 
CORNER POCKETS ONCE YOU PLAYED THE 
FIRST COUPLE OF SHOTS THE BLACK 
HAS HARDLY MOVED 
IT IS ALL REDS AND BLACKS WITH THE 
PINK BEING OUT OF COMMISSION THAT 
IS THE REASON HE HAS WE DIDN'T 
THINK THERE WAS A CHANCE OF 
POSSIBLE MAXIMUM BUT IT IS HALF A 
CHANCE 
HE HAS COME A BIT STRAIGHT ON THE 
BLACK THE FRAME IS OVER SO HE CAN 
PLAY AN ADVENTUROUS SHOT IF HE 
LIKES TRY TO DISTURB SOMETHING 
NO HE PLAYED FOR THE RED IN THE 
MIDDLE L. THINK HE PLAYED FOR IT 
INTO THE MIDDLE BUT HE HAS IT INTO 
THE FAR RIGHT CORNER THE FRAME IS 
OVER THE ONLY PRESSURE IS THE 
MAXIMUM 
THE CUT IN THE MIDDLE IS MAXIMUM ALSO ON 
HE NEEDED THE ANGLE ON THE BLACK 
IS IT TIME TO COME OFF TWO CUSHIONS 
AND TITUS BUT THOSE THREE MACRO 
REDS AND TRY TO SPLIT THOSE 
THREE REDS 
HE TRIED JAW SHOT AND IT ISN'T BAD 
AT ALL YOUR SHOT 
HE MUST PLAY 
THE CANNON TWO REDS AFTER THIS 
THE CANNON ON THE TWO RED 
BUT TRY AND COME IN BEHIND THEM 
SCREW IN BEHIND THEM OFF TWO 
CUSHIONS 
THAT WAS THE KEY SHOT HE DIDN'T 
GET BEHIND THEM HE STILL HAS TO 
RESERVE CAN HE POT THIS AND 
FLICKED THE OTHER TWO REDS OUT IT IT IS MIGHTY THIN IT MIGHT JUST BE 
THIN ENOUGH FOR THAT SHOT ALTHOUGH 
THERE SHAKE OF THE HEAD MIGHT SAY 
DIFFERENT 
UNLUCKY WHAT A GREAT EFFORT THAT 
WAS THAT WAS A PITY BUT THE FRAME 
WAS WELL AND TRULY ONE DING JUNHUI 
CONCEDED HE WANTED A MAXIMA BUT 
THERE IS THE CUE BALL JUST DROPPING 
IN THE CORNER BUT HE HAS LEVELLED 
THE MATCH 
SOME VERY MAXIMUM ATTEMPTS THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP SO MANY NOW THE 
REST OF THE NEWS TODAY 
THE FIRST SHOCK OF THE TOURNAMENT 
MARK SELBY BEATEN BY MARK KING IT 
IS A GREAT WIN FOR MARK THE FIRST 
TIME IN SIX YEARS HE HAS GOT PAST 
FIRST ROUND HE IS KNOCKING ON THE 
DOOR OF THE TOP SIXTEEN AGAIN HE NOW 
PLAYS PETER EBDON 
I PLAYED REALLY 
GOOD STUFF L. SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIVE TO FOUR 
UP AFTER THE FIRST SESSION L. JUST 
GIVE IT MY ALL AND PLAYED SOLID HE 
HAS GOT TO THE FINAL OF THE WORLD 
BUT HE IS JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE 
YOU PUT PRESSURE ON HIM AND HE 
MISSES L. PUT PRESSURE ON HIM AND 
WHEN HE MISSED I PLAYED 
HE PLAYED 
SOLID SNOOKER HE DIDN'T MAKE BIG 
BREAKS BUT HE MADE ENOUGH FRAME 
WINNING BREAKS I'M WAS STRUGGLING 
TO CONTROL THE WHITE AND IT PICK 
BREAKS AND A PLAYER OF YOUR STAND 
HIS STANDARD YOU NEED TO DO THAT 
I THOUGHT I WOULD BE NERVOUS WAS 
ACTUALLY HAS COME AS ANYTHING THE 
CLOSER I GOT TO IT THE MORE I GOT 
FOR MORE CAN'T I GOT THE MORE 
CALM I GOT WHEN I WAS ON THIRTY THREE I 
THOUGHT THERE WAS A CHANCE 
EIGHT TO ONE UP MARK WILLIAMS RAN OUT A TEN 
THREE WINNER AGAINST MARK DAVIS THERE 
HAS BEEN AN IMPROVEMENT IN MARK'S 
FORMS THIS SEASON THIS TOURNAMENT 
WILL SHOW WHETHER IT IS MARK 
WILLIAMS'S YEAR 
ALL DAMAGE WAS 
DONE IN THE FIRST SESSION L. DID 
QUITE WELL DONE L. PUT MARK UNDER 
PRESSURE COMING IN EIGHT ONE IN 
FRONT YOU SHOULDN'T USE A MATCH 
LOSE A MATCH FROM THERE IT IS ONE 
MATCH AS IT COMES AND CUP AND THE 
CANNON 
PLAYING THE 
WAY 
I WAS 
IN THE 
FIRST PART 
OF 
THE MATCH 
AND TRY 
AND 
CARRY ON FROM THERE IT WILL BE 
TOUGH TO PLAY O'SULLIVAN IF HE WINS 
THE NEXT GAME BUT I DON'T MIND WHO 
I PLAY L. WOULD RATHER PLAY WILLIE 
THORNE BECAUSE I WOULD BE 
GUARANTEED A WIN BUT I AM NOT THAT 
LUCKY SO IT WILL HAVE TO BE RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN FOR THE CHINESE MAN 
WILLIE DESERVES THE RIGHT TO REPLY 
I SLAUGHTERED HIM SIX TO ONE IN THE 
AUSTRALIAN MASTERS A FEW YEARS AGO 
THERE WILL HAVE A FEW WORDS IN HIS 
HERE DON'T WORRY HE IS A GOOD PAL 
AND A GREAT GREAT PLAYER 
YOU HAVEN'T MISSED MUCH IN THIS 
FRAME JUST THE ONE MACRO ON THE 
BOARD FROM DING JUNHUI THE ONE 
MACRO ON THE BOARD 
IT WAS A FLUKE PLAYED IN THE 
CORNER BUT HE WASN'T ON THE COLOUR 
AND HAD TO PLAY SAFE 
IT HAS BEEN SUCH A HIGH STANDARD 
THIS MATCH THERE HASN'T BEEN A 
FRAME WERE THERE HAS BEEN NO BREAK 
LESS THAN FORTY FOUR THERE HAS BEEN TWO 
NINETIES DING JUNHUI NEEDS TO GET HIS 
HAND BACK OTHER TABLE HE HAS BEEN 
KEPT OFF THE TABLE QUITE A WHILE 
NOW 
THAT SAFETY SUCCESS IS AMAZING YET 
THE LAST THREE FRAMES MARCO FU A 
BIG BREAKS OF ONE HUNDRED THREE ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX YOU 
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT DING JUNHUI 
WOULD BE GETTING MORE CHANCES AS 
MARCO'S SAFETY SUCCESS IS ONLY SEVENTY SIX 
PER CENT 
IT IS THE CLASSIC CASE OF 
A MATCH OF TWO HEARTS DING JUNHUI 
HAS COME DOWN A BIT BUT THE WAY 
MARCO HAS 
PLAYED 
IT IS 
TOUGH TO 
GET SAFE ANYWHERE 
THIS IS THE 
PLAYERS' VIEW OF THIS 
HE HASN'T GOT THE RED HE PLAYED 
SAFE THE RED HAS GONE TOWARDS THE 
CORNER POCKET FOR A CHANCE FOR 
MARCO 
WELL HE DOES MISS BUT WOULD 
FORTUNATELY FOR DING JUNHUI HE HAS 
PUSHED THE RED SAFE 
UNFORTUNATELY HE WOULD LIKE TO POT 
THIS AND SCREW INTO THE BUNCH 
LEAVING HIMSELF THE PINK 
AWKWARD ON BLUE NOT SO GOOD ON THE 
YELLOW THE GREEN IS POSSIBLE BUT 
IT NEEDS A GOOD POSITIONAL SHOT 
IF THE PINK SPOT IS COVERED IT 
WILL HELP BECAUSE HE WOULD LIKE 
THE PINK ON THE BLACK SPOT NO IT 
IS FREE BUT WILL IT BE POTTABLE 
HE HAS PERHAPS TOO MUCH ANGLE ON 
THE BLUE IF HE COMES OFF THE BLUE 
AND IT'S THE TOP CUSHION HE IS 
LOOKING AT THE RED NEAREST THE 
BLACK SPOT HE COULD DROP ON THAT 
AND POT THE BLACK AND THEN HE WOULD 
BE IN GOOD POSITION 
THE FIRST RED DOES IT GO 
IF HE 
DOES HOLE FOR THE BLACK HE'LL HAVE 
TO PLAY A THREE QUARTER BALL BLACK 
ALONG THE CUSHION 
HE WOULD NOT 
WANT TO PLAY THIS RED WITH TOO MUCH 
PACE WOULD HE 
HE HAS PLAYED FOR THE BLACK BUT IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN A BITTER WRANGLE TO 
JUST ROLL THIS IN AND STEALING THE 
RED A BETTER ANGLE GRAVITY 
TAKES OVER 
IF HE WOULD HAVE HAD A BETTER 
POTTING ANGLE ON THAT BLACK HE 
COULD HAVE PLAYED IT A BIT MORE 
POSITIVE AND IT PROBABLY WOULD 
HAVE DROPPED THAT FRACTION COULD 
MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE THAT WAS A 
GOOD CHANCE FOR THING YOU NEED TO 
BUILD UP A GOOD LEAD AND HOOK IT IS 
A CHANCE FOR MARCO FU TO COUNTER 
ATTACK DING JUNHUI 
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT IF EVER THERE 
COULD BE POSSIBLE TURNING POINT 
IN THE RUN OF FRAMES THAT MARCO FU 
HAS HURT THAT COULD BE IT WHY NOT 
JUST PLAY THE THING BLACK INTO THE 
BUNCH 
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT MY BUNCH THOUGHTS EXACTLY L. CAN ONLY ASSUME 
HE WAS PLAYING FOR ANOTHER COLOUR 
THAT WAS THE WRONG SHOT FOR ME 
THIS IS NOT EASY EITHER BUT TWO 
SHORT WELL PLAYED DASHED GOOD 
SHOT 
I DO NOT THINK THERE IS ANY VALUE 
IN IT TO PLEA INTO THE BUNCH FROM 
YOU WOULD YOU RISK GOING INTO THE 
BUNCH 
WHEN 
THE OBJECT BALL IS IN BUNCH THE JAWS OF THE POCKET IT IS HARD TO JUDGE HOW THE 
CUE BALL 
IS GOING 
TO COME AWAY FROM THE POCKET HE'S 
LOOKING AT COMING OFF THE LEFT HAND 
SIDE CUSHION AND GOING INTO THE 
CLUSTER BUT IT WAS TOO RISKY HE 
PLAYED THE CUSHION FIRST AND TRIED 
TO PLAY IN ONE OF THE LOOSE REDS 
THERE IS NOT ONE OF THEM SAVE HE 
PLAYED IT CUSHION FIRST AND WAS 
HOPING TO PLAY OFF A LOOSE RED IT 
WAS MORE HOPE THAN ANYTHING HE HAD 
REALLY WORKED OUT PLAYING A CANNON 
OFF THE BLACK INTO THE CLUSTER 
WOULD BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT 
HE DID VERY WELL TO HOLD THAT HE 
WANTED TO HOLD FOR THE BLUE BECAUSE 
IT IS EASIER TO GO INTO THE PINK 
FROM THE BLUE 
HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO CATCH THIS 
PINK FULL IN THE FACE BECAUSE IT IS 
SEPARATED FROM THE RED SLIGHTLY 
THIS NEEDS A GOOD SHOT HE DID NOT 
CATCH IT FULL IN THE FACE HE HAS 
STILL GOT A CHANCE OF A RED TO THE 
LEFT CENTRE IF HE CAUGHT FIRE 
GREAT FOOL IN 
DEFEAT 
PINK FULL 
THE 
FACE THE 
CUE BALL 
WOULD HAVE 
STAYED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE 
IT SURPRISES ME ABOUT YOUNGER 
PLAYERS HOW HARD THEY PLAY THAT 
SHOT PLAYERS LIKE STEPHEN HENDRY 
WOULD PLAY IT AT HALF THAT SPEED 
THERE WAS NO NEED TO PLAY IT AT 
THAT PACE HE HAS PUSHED THE REDS 
LOOSE AND HE HAS LOST THE WHITE HE 
MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO PLAY FOR THE 
BROWN OF THIS RED 
HE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT 
TWO CHANCES AND ONLY FORTY TWO POINT LEAD THIRTY TWO POINT 
THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY 
HIS SAFETY SUCCESS RATE IS HIGHER 
THAN MARCO FU'S THAT WAS AN 
EXCELLENT SAFETY SHOT AT FIRST 
GLANCE IT IS TOUGH TO GET BACK TO 
BAULK FROM HERE 
THIS IS WHAT HE IS LOOKING AT YOU 
CAN SEE THE ONE ON THE LEFT AND THE 
WENT TO 
THE RIGHT OF THE PINK BUT 
HOW DOES HE GET SAFE FROM THOSE 
TWO 
THE PATH BACK TO BAULK IS A PROBLEM 
HERE 
OF COURSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET 
BACK TO BAULK TO LEAVE IT SAFE 
HE THINKS HE CAN JUST GET PAST THE 
BLUE HE WILL HAVE TO CATCH THIS 
VERY THIN THAT IS A TERRIFIC SHOT 
NOT COMPLETELY SAFE BUT AS GOOD AS 
HE COULD HAVE DONE 
TWO EXCELLENT 
SAFETY SHOTS THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH 
THE SHORT MARCO FU HAS JUST 
COMPLETED IS THAT HE HAS LEFT ONE 
POSSIBLE SHORT BUT THE P. C. IS TO 
HAVE TO 
PUT INTO 
THIS 
TO MAKE 
THE POT 
IS GOING 
TO MAKE IT VERY 
DIFFICULT A LOT OF CUE BALL 
MOVEMENT IS NEEDED 
EXCELLENT POT HE HIT THAT SHOT AS 
GOOD AS ANY PLAYER IN THE WORLD 
THE CUE BALL HAS GONE AS DIFFICULT 
AS IT COULD BECAUSE 
HE WOULD 
LIKE 
TO PUT 
A LITTLE BIT OF PEACE ON 
THIS TO GET TO THE THREE REDS 
AROUND THE PINK SPOT THAT WAS 
PLAYED NICELY HE HAS A CHANCE TO 
WIN THE FRAME NOW AT THIS VISIT 
WITH THE THREE LOOSE REDS AND THE 
THREE BIG COLOURS 
HAVING PUT UP WITH THE BARRAGE OF 
BREAKS BUT HE HAS DONE THIS WAS A 
MASSIVE FRAME FOR IN JUNE THE 
DING JUNHUI FIFTY TWO AHEAD FIFTY SEVEN REMAINING 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE RISK OF 
POTTING 
THE BLACK 
AND BRINGING THE 
REDS INTO 
PLAY BECAUSE 
IT 
IS A 
BLACK THAT HE SHOULD NOT MISS TRY 
AND SCREW THE BLACK IN AND WHICH 
ONE OF THEM OVER THE CORNER MAKE 
SURE YOU POT THE BLACK WILL OF 
COURSE MAKE SURE YOU POT THE BLACK 
TO GO SIXTY IN FRONT WHAT ARE YOU 
DOING 
THAT IS UNFORGIVABLE DOING AGREE HE HAD TO PLAY THE CANNON 
ONE SNOOKER IF HE POTS THE BLACK 
HIS OPPONENT NEEDS ONE SNOOKER WE 
HAVE SEEN FRAMES ONE FROM THAT 
POSITION BUT HE HAD TO POT THE 
BLACK FIFTY THREE BEHIND FIFTY NINE REMAINING 
WHEN HE MISSED THE BLACK IT 
REMOVED THAT RED OFF THE LEFT HAND 
SIDE CUSHION THERE IS ONLY ONE 
AWKWARD RED NOW THE RED ON THE 
RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE AND 
THAT IS NOT THAT OF WORK WHAT A 
TURNAROUND THIS COULD BE THAT 
AWKWARD 
NOT HIS BEST POSITIONAL SHOT THAT 
HE NEEDS TO BE STRAIGHTER ON THE 
BLACK CAN HE HOLD FOR THE RED TO 
THE MIDDLE IT IS NOT EASY HE WILL 
HAVE TO PLAY A SOFT STUN HE HELD 
UP NICELY FIFTY SEVEN POINTS BEING BLUE SO 
HE HAS A COUPLE OF THIRTY SEVEN POINTS 
BEHIND SO HE HAS A COUPLE OF 
POINTS TO SPARE FORTY THREE LEFT ON THE 
TABLE 
THIS WILL LEAVE HIM NICELY ON THE 
BLUE HE SHOULD DROP BEHIND THE RED 
ALONG THE CUSHION TRYING TO BRING 
IT INTO PLAY WOULD BE DANGEROUS 
THAT ANGLE IS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HE 
WAS LOOKING FOR HE DOES NOT NEED 
TO DO A LOT WITH THE CUE BALL HE 
CANNOT BELIEVE THE BLACK THAT HE 
MISSED FRAME BALL IN GOES THE 
RED AND 
HE IS PERFECT 
ON THE BLACK THIS TIME WHAT A TOM 
AROUND TURNAROUND 
THAT WAS TERRIBLE I DON'T KNOW IF 
HE GOT A BAD CONTACT BUT THERE WAS 
NO CUE BALL MOVEMENT HE GOT A BAD 
CONTACT WE WILL FORGIVE HIM YOU 
NEED TO BEAT UP NEAR THE BLUE BUT 
FINISHING SHORT BE UP BE THE 
BLUE 
JUST THE SAFETY THAT MISSED BLACK 
ISN'T THE CATALYST FOR DING JUNHUI 
LOSING THE FRAME NOT YET ANYWAY 
THIS IS A TOUGH SAFETY YOU HAVE TO 
PLAY IT WITH TOP SPIN LOTS OF TOP 
SPIN AND GET THE WHITE TO LARK IT 
COULD FINISH BEHIND THE BLACK 
BROWN IT IS BAR WHERE THE OBJECT 
BALL IS GOING THE GREEN HE MUST 
GET THAT SAFE 
HE PLAYED THE THIN ONE THAT WAS 
ASKING FOR TROUBLE I 
ASKING FOR TROUBLE I COULDN'T AGREE MORE HE CHOSE THE MORE 
DIFFICULT FOR THE TWO OPTIONS 
MARCO FU HAS A CHANCE OF WINNING A 
FRAME HE NEVER LOOKED BACK WINNING 
THE PINK ISN'T ON ITS SPOT SO IT 
ISN'T STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT IT IS NO 
EXCUSE NOT TO CLEAR FROM HERE 
THIS IS DOOMED TO BE SO HEARD FOR 
FOR DING JUNHUI HE LED FIVE TO ONE AND HAD 
TO HAVE STOPPED THE ROT HE MISSED 
THE BLACK EVENTUALLY IT HAS COST 
HIM THE FRAME BREAKS OF THIRTY THREE AND PER 
D. FIVE HAVE PUT MARK GREW FROM IN THE 
LEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME AT SIX TO FIVE 
TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE WHAT A TURNAROUND 
FIVE TO ONE DOWN SIX 
HAVE AND FIVE UP DING JUNHUI 
WALKING OUT TO GET HIS HEAD FREE OF 
ALL THE PROBLEMS HE HAD THE FRAME 
ON A PLATE HE JUST HAD TO POT THE 
BLACK HE WOULD HAVE WON THE FRAME 
FORTY NINE TIMES OUT OF FIFTY IF HE HAD CAUGHT 
THE BLACK HE KNEW IT COULD SPELL 
DISASTER HE WAS TRYING TO SHIFT 
THE RED HE DIDN'T HAVE DO HE IS 
KICKING HIMSELF HE WASN'T HAPPY AT 
ALL BUT WHAT A FANTASTIC MATCH WE 
ARE UP THERE AT EIGHT P. M. SNOOKER FANS 
KEEP THE RED BUTTON GOING IN CHINA 
EIGHT HOURS AHEAD THEY WILL BE 
GOING BLEARY EYED TO WORK IN THE 
MORNING 
HOW DO YOU GET A SHOT OUT MORNING OF THE DOOR HAD OUT OF YOUR HEAD 
LIKE THAT 
SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T FIND 
YOUR OPPONENT GOES FROM STRENGTH TO 
STRENGTH BUT KNOWING THE STANDARD 
OF THE PLAYERS I THINK HE MAY HAVE 
OTHER CHANCES BUT HOW UNLUCKY FOR 
BOTH PLAYERS TO CATCH EACH OTHER ON 
FORM IN THE FIRST ROUND DING HAS 
BEEN UNLUCKY TO CATCH MARCO FU IN 
FORM HE COULD HAVE HAD AN EASIER 
PATH TO THE SECOND ROUND 
BACK TO 
WILLIE AND JOHN A DECENT BREAK OFF SHOT FROM MARCO 
HE HAD TO GET THE WHITE JUST FIGHT 
THE RED MIGHT TEMPT MARCO FU 
DING JUNHUI'S CONCENTRATION MUST 
HAVE GONE COMPLETELY HE NEEDED TO 
MAKE SURE THERE WAS NOTHING EASY ON 
MARCO DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING TO 
POT THE RED HIS CONCENTRATION 
LOOKS TO HAVE GONE OUT OF THE 
WINDOW 
TERRIFIC POSITIONAL SHOT DING 
JUNHUI HAS LEFT THE CUE BALL IN THE 
CORNER AND SHOULD HAVE CHECKED 
THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE PLANT 
ANYWHERE MARCO SPOTTED IT 
NOW HAS HE GOT THE ANGLE TO POT IT 
THE BLACK AND CANNON THE RED HE 
DID AND THIS IS A REASONABLE 
CHANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WAY 
THESE PLAYERS HAVE BEEN PLAYING IN 
THIS MATCH CHANCES LIKE THIS 
USUALLY RESULT IN A SIZEABLE 
CONTRIBUTION 
IT HAS BEEN A PRODUCTIVE SEASON FOR 
MARCO FU HE HAS GONE TWENTY SEVENTH IN THE 
WORLD 
THAT WASN'T ONE OF HIS BEST TO BE 
HONEST I DON'T THINK HE PLAYED THE 
CANNON L. THINK HE TRIED TO MISS 
THE RED SO A PREMATURE END THERE 
MARCO WON'T BE PLEASED BUT DING 
JUNHUI WILL BE 
I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO RUN PAST 
THE CLUSTER THERE WAS A RED FREE 
TO THE RIGHT ABOVE THE BLACK THAT 
IS HOW WE WOULD HAVE PLAYED IT HE 
WOULD HAVE BOUNCED OFF THE CUSHION 
AND COME BACK FOR THE RED BUT YOU 
HAVE THE RIGHT LINE 
WHAT A POT THAT WAS THAT IS WHAT 
HE'S CAPABLE OF THIS YOUNG MAN CAN 
POT ANYTHING IT IS A BIG TEST OF 
CHARACTER AND NOW FOR HIM THOUGH 
FIVE TO ONE IN FRONT NOW BEHIND HE HAS 
LOST FIVE FRAMES ON THE SPIN 
THIS IS A REAL TEST OF CHARACTER 
HAVING LOST FIVE FRAMES ON THE TROT 
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THE WAY 
THE WAY HE LOST THE LAST FRAME IF 
HE CAN WIN THIS FRAME IT WILL 
PROVE HE IS STILL THINKING ABOUT 
WIN THE MATCH HE LOOKED A BIT 
FORLORN IN THE CHAIR A FEW MOMENTS 
AGO AS IF HE HAD EVERYTHING ON HIS 
SHOULDERS BUT THIS IS GOOD 
CHANCE TO WIN THE FRAME HAVING 
LOST FIVE ON THE TROT I AM 
RELUCTANT TO SAY THIS IS FRAME WINNING CHANCE 
THIS COULD BE THE KEY TO HIM 
WINNING THE FRAME AT THIS VISIT IT 
IS PRETTY GOOD A GREAT CHANCE 
THIS COULDN'T WISH FOR A BETTER 
ONE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF GIVING US 
HAVE A CHOICE OF SHOTS 
HE HAS A 
CHOICE OF THREE REDS WHEN YOU'RE 
BREAK BUILDING GIVE YOURSELF 
OPTIONS 
THIS IS A GREAT MATCH
