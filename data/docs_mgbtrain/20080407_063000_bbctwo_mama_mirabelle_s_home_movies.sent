TAKE A LOOK AT OUR FINE FEATHERED FRIENDS 
WHAT PART OF THEIR BODY DO THEY USE TO FLY 
I KNOW THEY USE THEIR WINGS THEY CERTAINLY DO MAXIE 
THEY MOVE THEIR WINGS UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN 
THAT'S CALLED FLAPPING AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU A TRUE FLYER 
AND SPEAKING OF TRUE FLYERS A PEREGRINE FALCON THAT'S ME

YAY YAY WOO HOO WOW 
NOW LET'S MEET ANOTHER CHAMPION FLYER THE DRAGONFLY 
HEY IT'S GOT FOUR WINGS WAIT 
THAT'S NOT A BIRD THAT'S RIGHT KARLA 
THE DRAGONFLY IS AN INSECT 
HE CAN FLY UP DOWN SIDEWAYS AND EVEN BACKWARDS 
HA HA I TOLD YOU YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE A BIRD TO FLY 
CAN HE FLY FAST 
FASTER THAN ME NOT QUITE PERRY BUT HE CERTAINLY CAN ZOOM ALONG 
JUST A LITTLE BIT SLOWER THAN A ZEBRA CAN RUN 
THAT BEE IS BUZZING YES BEES KEEP REALLY BUSY 
THEY FLAP THEIR WINGS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TIMES A SECOND THAT'S A LOT OF FLAPPING 
NOW LET'S LEAVE THE INSECTS BEHIND 
AND FLY ON TO THE FLYING FOX 
A FOX THAT FLIES YOU MUST BE JOKING 
THERE'S NO WAY THAT THAT IS A BIRD 
NO HE'S A SORT OF BAT THE ONLY FLYING MAMMAL 
LOOK AT THEM GO AND JUST FOR FUN 
LET'S LOOK AT FERDINAND THE FLYING SQUIRREL 
NOW SQUIRRELS ARE FLYING OH NO 
WELL THE FACT IS THEY DON'T ACTUALLY FLY 
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S FLYING 
HE'S ACTUALLY GLIDING WITHOUT FLAPPING WINGS HE CAN'T REALLY FLY 
AREN'T THOSE WINGS MAMA NO MAXIE 
THEY'RE PIECES OF SKIN THAT STRETCH OUT AND HELP THE SQUIRREL TO GLIDE 
SEE PERRY I WAS RIGHT LOTS OF ANIMALS FLY NOT JUST BIRDS 
YES BUT ZEBRAS STILL CAN'T FLY 
SEE YOU 
YOU KNOW MAMA PERRY'S RIGHT 
I WISH I COULD FLY IT MUST BE SO WONDERFUL 
I KNOW KARLA BUT YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE 
I COULD TAKE OFF AND SOAR WITH A BIT OF IMAGINATION 
OH YOU COULD BE A ZE BIRD 
ZOOMING WAY UP HIGH 
AND YOU COULD BE AN ELE BIRD 
LOOP THE LOOPING ACROSS THE SKY 
A ZE BIRD AND AN ELE BIRD OH WHAT A PRETTY PAIR 
BOUNCING ON A CLOUD OR TWO AND DANCING IN THE AIR 
WITH THOSE GREAT BIG EARS OF YOURS YOU'LL SIT RIGHT BACK AND GLIDE 
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND DREAM TO BE A STRIPY STREAK RIGHT BY MY SIDE 
A ZE BIRD AND AN ELE BIRD OH WHAT A PRETTY PAIR 
BOUNCING ON A CLOUD OR TWO AND DANCING IN THE AIR 
THEN WHEN ALL THE FLYING'S OVER AND WE FLOAT ON DOWN TO REST 
IT'S A GOOD TIME TO REMEMBER WE STILL LIKE BEING US THE BEST 
A ZE BIRD AND AN ELE BIRD OH WHAT A PRETTY PAIR 
WHAT A PRETTY PAIR 
OH THANKS MAMA THAT WAS FUN 
YES FLYING IS FUN ALL RIGHT 
WE BIRDS CERTAINLY HAVE ALL THE RIGHT MOVES 
HOW RIGHT YOU ARE PERRY 
BUT OF COURSE NOT ALL BIRDS ARE GREAT FLYERS 
IN FACT SOME OF THEM CAN'T FLY AT ALL 
WHAT'S THAT MAMA SOME BIRDS CAN'T FLY 
WHY DON'T WE WATCH ANOTHER MOVIE ALL ABOUT IT YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS 
IT'S CALLED EARTHBOUND BIRDS

HERE THEY ARE AGAIN WALKING OR WADDLING MORE LIKE IT

PENGUINS ARE BIRDS THAT WALK A LITTLE SWIM A LOT 
AND CAN'T FLY AT ALL 
A BIRD THAT CAN SWIM I CAN'T DO THAT

UP TO THIRTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR 
A BIRD THAT CAN RUN WOW

AND THERE ARE SOME BIRDS WHO CAN FLY JUST A LITTLE 
LIKE QUAIL AND WILD TURKEYS 
BUT MOSTLY THEY JUST LOVE TO RUN AND RUN LIKE THIS ONE
