OH NO 
MY NAME'S KATE REGULA 
I WROTE THE POEM WRITING A POEM WHEN I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD 
WE TALKED ABOUT SNAKES AT SCHOOL THE ANACONDA WAS MY FAVOURITE 
AFTER BREAK WE WERE TOLD TO WRITE A DESCRIPTIVE BIT OF WRITING 
ENTITLED WRITING A POEM 
I SCRIBBLED DOWN A FEW LINES 
AND BIT BY BIT MY WRITING STARTED TURNING INTO A POEM 
ON THE LAST LINE I THOUGHT WOW I'VE WRITTEN A POEM 
HARD REALLY LOST FOR WORDS 
AND WONDERING WHAT TO DO 
RUN OUR FINGERS DOWN THE PAGE 
DON'T TELL ME I'VE MADE A MISTAKE 
THE WORDS AREN'T IN THE RIGHT 
PLACE 
HUNTING FOR WORDS IS DIFFICULT 
ERASING THIS ERASING THAT 
MISS MY E. IS CROOKED 
R. IS MUCH TOO FAT 
S. IS AN ANACONDA CRAWLING UP MY LEG 
SO YOU SEE I HATE WRITING POEMS 
YOU SEE I MAKE MISTAKES 
I CAN'T STAND THE WAY MY LETTERS GO 
SQUISH AND SQUASH THE LETTERS 
BAKE THEM INTO A CAKE
