THE CAR HAS BEEN BOOKED FOR THIRTY MINUTES 
THIRTY MINUTES 
THIRTY MINUTES 
SHOWER'S FREE 
TATE MODERN FORMERLY A DERELICT TURBINE HALL ON THE SOUTH BANK OF THE RIVER THAMES 
NOW A GLAMOROUS HOME TO THE WORLD'S BIGGEST COLLECTION OF MODERN ART 
GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SIR ALAN 
HERE WE ARE IN THE TATE MODERN 
THIS BUILDING WAS ONCE ONE OF LONDON'S POWER STATIONS 
THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE 
OF THE REJUVENATION AND REDEPLOYMENT OF A BUILDING INTO SOMETHING GREAT 
YOUR TASK IS ALL ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATION OF TWO PUBS 
THE PUB INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SUFFERING FOR A WHILE 
THEY HAVE GOT TO FIND WAYS AND MEANS OF BRINGING PEOPLE IN 
THE WAYS AND MEANS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND TO BRING PEOPLE 
INTO THESE TWO PUBS IS YOU'RE GOING TO PUT ON A FOOD SERVICE 
I HAVE GOT TO KNOW YOU ALL A LITTLE BIT OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS 
AND I AM NOT GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO CHOOSE YOUR TEAM LEADERS THIS TIME 
I'M GOING TO CHOOSE THEM MYSELF 
IAN YOU'RE GONNA BE ONE OF THEM AND SARA 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE OTHER ONE STEP FORWARD THE PAIR OF YOU 
IT IS VERY SIMPLE THIS TASK 
THE TEAM THAT COMES BACK WITH THE MOST AMOUNT OF PROFIT IS GOING 
TO WIN AND THE TEAM THAT DOESN'T IS GOING TO LOSE 
IN THAT TEAM ONE OF YOU WILL GET FIRED 
O. K. OFF YOU GO 
BOTH TEAMS HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO TRANSFORM A PUB INTO A FULLY THEMED RESTAURANT 
SERVING A RANGE OF THREE COURSE MEALS IN THE STYLE OF THEIR CHOICE 
RUNNING THE GIRLS' TEAM CAR TRADER AND TRAINED BARRISTER SARA 
I THINK I'LL DO WELL IN THIS TASK BECAUSE AS A LEADER 
I AM GOING TO LISTEN BUT I AM QUITE FORCEFUL AS WELL 
IF I AM TALKING TOO MUCH AND YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE NOT BEING HEARD OR WHATEVER 
JUST SAY THAT TO ME EVEN NOW 
JUST SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT THE PROBLEM IS I GO TOO FAST 
WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL YOU'RE DOING IT NOW 
THE DUKE OF HAMILTON IN UPMARKET HAMPSTEAD KNOWN FOR ITS TRADITIONAL ALES 
OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS IT WILL BE IN THE HANDS OF THE BOYS 
UNDER TEAM LEADER AND SOFTWARE SALES MANAGER IAN 
BEFORE WE GET INTO THE NITTY GRITTY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU 
BUT I AM GOING TO COMMIT THAT I WILL GIVE YOU GUYS AS MUCH 
CLEAR AND CONCISE MANAGEMENT AS I CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT 
WE HAVE THE NEXT TREAT FROM SIR ALAN DEFINITELY 
I'D LIKE TO GO ROUND THE ROOM AND GET YOUR COMMITMENT TO GIVING YOUR ALL 
I REALLY WANT TO WIN THIS IAN YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY RELY ON MY ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT COMMITMENT ME TOO 
THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE IN LIFE THERE ARE WINNERS 
AND THE SECOND ONE I CAN'T SPELL AND I CAN'T SAY IT I WON'T SAY IT 
SECOND PLACE NOT WINNERS IT BEGINS WITH L. YOU CAN WORK IT OUT 
BRAINSTORM CREATIVE HATS ON GUYS YEAH LET'S GET THE THEME RIGHT 
CHICKEN IN A BASKET BURGER AND CHIPS AMERICAN DINER YEAH 
I GET THE FEELING THIS PLACE WILL BE SAUSAGE MASH STEAK CHIPS 
MY VOTE IS ITALIAN FOOD YOU HAVE GOT PASTA SIMPLE PIZZAS VERY EASY TO MAKE QUICK 
IT IS A LIGHT BULB MOMENT SHOOT IT DOWN OR KEEP IT UP THERE 
WE PUT A FEW ITALIAN FLAGS OUT WE'VE GOT AN ITALIAN COMMUNITY 
WAITERS WITH FALSE MOUSTACHES ITALIAN FOOD NO 
THAT IS TERRIFIC I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE NEED SUPERB 
O. K. IN WHICH CASE 
GUYS IT'S AN ITALIAN THEME IN THIS PUB TOMORROW ARE WE THERE BOYS 
RENAISSANCE ONE TWO THREE RENAISSANCE RIGHT O. K. 
SARA'S TEAM HAS THE KING'S HEAD A VICTORIAN PUB IN ISLINGTON 
INSIDE THE GIRLS DISCUSS THEMES 
I HAD THE IDEA INSTANTLY OF DOING A MURDER MYSTERY NIGHT 
SOMETHING LIKE A HYPNOTIST OR A MAGICIAN 
I WASN'T WORRIED ABOUT THE TASK 
MY MAIN ISSUE 
WAS WITH HOW I WAS GONNA DEAL WITH THE OTHER CHARACTERS IN THE TEAM 
IN WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY HAD ARGUMENTS AMONGST EACH OTHER 
I FELT THAT WE HAD TO GO FOR GOOD QUALITY ENGLISH CLASSIC DISHES SUCH AS 
BANGERS AND MASH STEAK TRADITIONAL ENGLISH FOOD 
HOW ABOUT SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAT PEOPLE HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY 
SOMETHING LIKE BOLLYWOOD NIGHT 
EVERYBODY LOVES A GOOD CURRY IT'S SO EASY TO GET THE OUTFITS 
AND HAVE A DANCE GO AROUND THE TABLES WHILE PEOPLE ARE EATING 
I LIKE IT I THINK IT IS REALLY GOOD 
CAN I SAY SORRY TO INTERRUPT ABOUT THE CURRY MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAVE 
A PIE OR WHATEVER ENGLISH FOOD THAN CURRY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON 
CAN I ROUND IT UP 
THIS DISCUSSION COULD GO ON BOLLYWOOD OR ENGLISH ONE WORD 
BOLLYWOOD I AM BOLLYWOOD 
BOLLYWOOD ENGLISH BOLLYWOOD ONE TWO THREE 
FOUR ARE FOR BOLLYWOOD BOLLYWOOD WE'RE GOING FOR BOLLYWOOD NIGHT 
IN HAMPSTEAD THE BOYS HAVE CHOSEN TO COOK ITALIAN FOOD 
THERE IS TWO GUYS THAT HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO GO IN THE KITCHEN AT THE MOMENT KEVIN AND SIMON 
KEVIN CAN BE HEAD CHEF WE WILL SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS THE MENU 
I AM HAPPY BEING HEAD CHEF 
THE HEAD CHEF IN AN ESTABLISHMENT LIKE THIS THE HEAD CHEF MANAGES THE KITCHEN 
HE IS OFTEN A LARGER THAN LIFE PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER 
WHOSE EGO NEEDS TO BE MANAGED THANKFULLY KEVIN YOU'RE NOT THAT 
BUT EVERYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THAT KITCHEN ON YOUR HEAD BE IT 
GUYS WE'RE HAPPY WITH THE ROLES LET'S GET TO IT 
TWO P. M. 
TO PULL IN AS MANY CUSTOMERS AS POSSIBLE THE TEAMS WILL HAVE TO PROMOTE THEIR THEMED FOOD NIGHTS 
MARKETING CONSULTANT JENNIFER IS LEADING THE GIRLS FRONT OF HOUSE LEAVING SARA LUCINDA AND CLAIRE 
TO SOURCE THE PRODUCE AND CREATE THE MENU 
SHALL I START PUTTING TOGETHER EVEN A WEE TIMETABLE 
THE FIRST THING WE TO DO IS DECIDE ON A MENU THAT IS THE MAIN THING 
IF WE DO NOT HAVE A MENU WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE KEEP THOSE THOUGHTS BUT MENU IS FIRST 
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH HAVING 
A BOLLYWOOD THEME IS ONE 
THE COST WHICH IS GOING TO BE INVOLVED TO SET IT ALL UP 
PROPS ETC THE SECOND THING IS CURRY IS QUITE NICHE 
I THINK ENGLISH FOOD WOULD HAVE HAD A WIDER APPEAL THOSE ARE 
MY CONCERNS ABOUT BOLLYWOOD NIGHT 
IF I WAS PROJECT MANAGER WE'D BE DOING SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
FOR INSPIRATION THE GIRLS TURN TO AN INDIAN RESTAURANT JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM THE PUB 
HERE WE NEED TO FIND OUT THE MOST POPULAR MAIN COURSE 
AND ALSO WHAT IS IN EACH OF THE DISHES 
MAYBE THEY MIGHT BE NICE ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY GIVE US THE EXACT RECIPE 
WHAT ABOUT PAVAROTTI'S PALACE I THINK 
THREE FIFTEEN P. M. 
THE BOYS TRY TO BRAND THEIR ITALIAN FOOD IDEAS 
WHAT ABOUT ITALIAN CUISINE OF THE DUKE OF HAMILTON 
IT SAYS WHAT IT IS A TASTE OF ITALY AT THE DUKE OF HAMILTON 
A TASTE OF ITALY A TASTE OF ITALY AT THE DUKE OF HAMILTON LET'S DO THAT 
I AM ALSO THINKING ABOUT FEIGNING AN ITALIAN ACCENT ALL OF US THROUGHOUT THE EVENING 
TALKING SINGING WHATEVER 
WRITE THAT DOWN THAT IS A GOOD IDEA ALL OF US FEIGN ITALIAN ACCENTS 
I DUNNO HOW YOU SPELL ACCENT 
A C. C. E. N. T. 
SO THEY DON'T POISON ANYONE BOTH TEAMS GET A KITCHEN ADVISER WHO WON'T COOK 
NICE TO MEET YOU KEVIN SIMON 
NICE TO MEET YOU IAN NICE TO MEET YOU 
WE'RE THEMING THIS PUB TOMORROW NIGHT AS AN ITALIAN IT IS GOING TO BE ITALIAN FOOD HERE 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE KITCHEN STAFF THE HEAD CHEF IS KEVIN HI 
I LIKE TO THINK I AM PROBABLY A BIT OF A CULINARY ADVENTURER 
I LIKE TO COOK AND I ENJOY BEING IN THE KITCHEN 
I LIKE TO TRY NEW THINGS 
I THINK THIS TASK WILL BE A LOT OF FUN AND I CAN'T WAIT TO DO IT 
I WAS THINKING SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE I CAN GET A BATCH OF BOLOGNESE SAUCE 
I WAS ALSO THINKING OF A CARBONARA SO BASIC YOU KNOW 
I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK WHAT WE COULD HAVE WITH THAT MAYBE 
MAYBE A BAKED MUSHROOM BAKED IN THE OVEN WITH SALT AND PEPPER 
AND THEN WE CAN PUREE THAT INTO A SAUCE 
AND SERVE THAT WITH 
WHAT 
I DON'T KNOW SALTED POTATOES 
HOW ITALIAN IS THAT 
I HAVE SEEN THAT IN QUITE A LOT OF ITALIAN RESTAURANTS 
KEVIN PUT HIMSELF FORWARD AS HEAD CHEF AND THE OTHERS SEEMED TO AGREE 
HE MUST HAVE DONE SOME COOKING IN THE HOUSE 
BUT HIS IDEA OF WHAT COMPRISES 
AN ITALIAN MENU LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED 
I THINK THEY HAVE GONE INTO THIS ITALIAN THEME 
WITHOUT ACTUALLY THINKING WHAT SHOULD WE PUT ON THE MENU 
WE COULD GET A THIRTY LATTE MACHINE AND MAKE LATTES AND SPRINKLE IT WITH CHOCOLATE 
LET'S CONCENTRATE ON DESSERT THAT IS A DESSERT 
COFFEE COMES UNDER DESSERTS SOMETIMES I WON'T HAVE A DESSERT I'LL HAVE A COFFEE 
YES OR NO JACK DOES COFFEE COME UNDER DESSERTS NO 
NO RIGHT MOVE ON 
HAVING AGREED ON A MENU PROJECT MANAGER IAN 
HEAD CHEF KEVIN AND SIMON HEAD OFF TO BUY INGREDIENTS 
AT A NORTH LONDON PRINTER 
THE MARKETING TEAM PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO A GLOSSY AND EXPENSIVE LEAFLET 
SOMETHING MORE CURLY 
TANTALISING TOMATO AND BASIL SOUP AND MOUTH WATERING BRUSCHETTA 
ALL THEY NEED ARE THE PRICES 
HELLO MATE THE SOUP FOUR POINT TWO FIVE 
SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE IS NINE POINT NINE FIVE 
HOLD ON KEVIN WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THAT PRICING FROM 
IF YOU WANT TO PRICE IT YOU PRICE IT 
I AM CONCERNED LEE MCQUEEN IS CONCERNED 
AND SO'S SIMON 
HOW MUCH MARGIN KEVIN LISTEN TO ME HOW MUCH MARGIN ARE WE MAKING 
HERE PASS ME THE PHONE HOW MUCH MARGIN 
ON A PANINI IF WE'RE MAKING TEN P. WHAT IS THE POINT THE SHORT ANSWER AT THIS STAGE IS WE DON'T KNOW 
WE HAVEN'T GOT THE SUPPLIES OR THE GOODS SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY PRICES 
WE'RE JUST AT A DELI OFF THE MENU 
WAIT BEFORE YOU TELL HIM THAT I NEED TO TALK TO YOU BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING 
HONESTLY I NEED TO 
I'LL CALL YOU IN TWO MINUTES SIMON WANTS TO TALK TO ME HANG ON 
TALK TO HIM WHILE WE'RE ON THE PHONE 
THINGS LIKE THAT HAVE TO BE CHECKED THEY HAVE TO BE CHECKED THAT'S WHAT LET ME FINISH 
WE HAVE GOT TO START DEALING IN ABSOLUTE FACT FACT FACT 
SIMON WHAT FACTS DO YOU WANT RIGHT NOW 
GRAB THAT RED MATERIAL 
WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO KEEP BOLLYWOOD NIGHT SPENDING AT A MINIMUM 
JENNIFER'S FRONT OF HOUSE TEAM IS OUT TO DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN 
HELLO WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME SARIS 
WE'RE HAVING A WONDERFUL EVENT IN THE LOCAL AREA 
WE ARE REALLY HOPING WE CAN OFFER YOU FREE ADVERTISING OR SOMETHING IN RETURN FOR BORROWING FOUR OUTFITS 
WHILE THE BOYS HAVE OPTED FOR EXPENSIVELY PRINTED MENUS THE GIRLS TAKE A CUT PRICE APPROACH 
RIGHT TWO HUNDRED TICKETS WITH YOUR LOVELY COMPANY'S NAME ON EVERY SINGLE TICKET AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT FOR FREE 
WHY NOT EXCELLENT THANK YOU GOOD DEAL 
PROJECT MANAGER SARA IS STILL TRYING TO NAIL DOWN A WORK SCHEDULE 
I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE PRICING OF WHAT THEY HAVE 
AT THE RESTAURANT HERE AND MAYBE A PROMOTION IF YOU HAVE A THREE COURSE MEAL IT'S THIS MUCH 
WHAT WOULD BE MORE USEFUL FOR ME IS IF INSTEAD OF DISCUSSING EVERY POINT WE JUST GO 
FOR EXAMPLE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE PEOPLE BUY THE FOOD COOK THE FOOD DRESS THE ROOM 
BUT WE KNOW BUT WE DON'T 
THEY HAVE GOT SO MUCH TO DO THEY HAVEN'T GOT ANY FOOD YET 
THERE'S SOME LOOSE TALK ABOUT HIRING A BOLLYWOOD DANCER FROM SOMEWHERE 
BUT UNLESS THEY START GETTING THEIR ACT TOGETHER 
AND PULLING IT ALL TOGETHER IT'S GOING TO BE A REAL DOG'S DINNER 
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING O. K. FIRST THING WE NEED JUST WRITE THE LIST 
WE'RE ASKING YOU AS PROJECT MANAGER WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WE WANT A CONCISE SUMMARY 
PLEASE WRITE A LIST WITHOUT EXPLAINING EVERY POINT 
BECAUSE WE DID NOT GO WITH THE ENGLISH THEME WHICH SHE WANTED IT HAS PISSED HER OFF 
SHE HAS TRIED TO FIND EVERY WAY FOR THE BOLLYWOOD NIGHT TO FAIL 
CLAIRE I THINK YOU'RE BEING VERY ARGUMENTATIVE 
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON AND YOU'RE CREATING A DRAMA HERE 
I HAVE ASSIGNED YOU A TASK 
YOU JUST CARRY ON WITH THE TASK THAT YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN 
I WILL MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER BY TOMORROW 
I AM JUST GOING TO GO OUTSIDE FOR A BIT OF AIR 
I AM A REALLY STRONG PERSON 
I FEEL LIKE TELLING CLAIRE TO SHUT THE FUCK UP 
FIVE O'CLOCK P. M. 
SIR ALAN HAS GIVEN BOTH TEAMS A LIST OF CUT PRICE WHOLESALE SUPPLIERS 
BUT IT'S LATE AND IAN'S BOYS HAVE DECIDED TO BUY VEGETABLES LOCALLY 
HELLO 
IT IS MICHAEL HERE I HAVE GOT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS 
I THINK THE COSTING IS TOO EXPENSIVE 
CHARGING PEOPLE FOUR POINT TWO FIVE FOR A BOWL OF SOUP 
THAT IS WHAT I WOULD PAY IN GUILDFORD 
O. K. WHAT WAS THAT I THINK TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE YES 
HAVE THE MENUS BEEN PRINTED 
NO THEY HAVEN'T THIS IS A FINAL DO IT OR DON'T DO IT CALL YEAH 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT RIGHT 
O. K. DO THE SOUP FOR TWO POINT NINE FIVE PLEASE O. K. SOUP FOR TWO POINT NINE FIVE YEAH 
I DON'T WANT US TO GET ANYTHING WRONG IT SEEMS WE'RE JUST PLUCKING PRICES OUT OF THE AIR 
WHAT WAS THE REASONING BEHIND THAT I WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT I DON'T WANT 
IT IS JUST TOO MUCH MONEY TO CHARGE PEOPLE FOR A BOWL OF SOUP 
HAVING SETTLED ON PRICES IT IS BANK MANAGER KEVIN'S JOB TO WORK OUT THE COSTS 
HOW MANY TOMATOES DO YOU NEED 
FOR THE SOUP FOR FOUR PEOPLE WE NEED TEN FRESH TOMATOES 
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT SAY FIFTEEN PEOPLE ORDERING SOUP 
YEP THEN YOU KNOW 
IS IT WORTH BECAUSE WE ARE CATERING FOR OTHER PEOPLE HERE 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOR FIFTEEN PORTIONS OF SOUP TEN FOR FOUR PEOPLE 
IS IT WORTH CONSIDERING COS WE'RE CATERING FOR OTHER PEOPLE KEVIN GIVE ME A MINUTE 
WE ARE CATERING FOR OTHER PEOPLE DOING ITALIAN FOOD 
MOST ITALIAN FOOD I KNOW IS TOMATO BASED 
IS IT WORTH A TRY TO GET A DEAL FOR A BIG BAG OF TOMATOES THAT IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE SOME CRATES BUT I NEED TO WORK OUT HOW MANY CRATES WE NEED 
RIGHT O. K. FOR FIFTEEN PORTIONS OF SOUP WE NEED FORTY TOMATOES 
EVEN IF YOU HAVE ONE TABLE OF FOUR 
AND THEY ALL ORDERED SOUP THAT IS FOUR PORTIONS DOWN 
WE WOULD ONLY HAVE SIX ELEVEN PORTIONS LEFT 
THAT IS FOR THE WHOLE EVENING DO YOU WANT MORE 
I THINK SO HEAD CHEF YEAH HOW MANY WOULD YOU LIKE 
I THINK WE NEED ENOUGH FOR THIRTY BOWLS OF SOU P. 
YOU HAVE GOT A CALL 
HANG ON A SECOND 
I WILL TAKE IT IF YOU LIKE 
HI IT'S IAN HI IAN 
IT'S ALEX WE HAVE JUST BEEN SPEAKING TO THE PRINT SHOP 
I HAVE MANAGED TO NEGOTIATE THEM DOWN FROM TWO PER MENU TO ONE EACH

YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY GARAM MASALA 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY YOU HAVEN'T GOT GROUND CORIANDER 
YOU DON'T HAVE CLOVES CINNAMON WE WERE GONNA GET PAPRIKA 
YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOT ENOUGH SPICE PRODUCTS TO BE HONEST 
IF IT TASTES GOOD PEOPLE WON'T REALISE 
WE'VE GOT REALLY HIGH QUALITY MEAT AND WE DO HAVE ALL THE MASALAS 
IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WAY OF COOKING 
IT'S REALLY SORE 
THREE HOURS BEFORE OPENING TIME 
HAVING BLOWN ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED ON SUPPLIES IAN'S HALF OF THE TEAM IS BACK 
BUT THEY'VE FORGOTTEN AN ITALIAN BASIC CIABATTAS FOR THEIR PANINI SPECIALS 
TO TEST MANAGEMENT ONCE TEAMS ARE SPLIT INTO GROUPS SIR ALAN INSISTS THOSE GROUPS MUST STAY TOGETHER

IF YOU'RE STILL OUT AND ABOUT GUYS CAN YOU GET US ADD TO YOUR LIST TWENTY FIVE CIABATTAS

BLACK BAGS WHY HAVE I GOT TO GO AND BUY BLACK BAGS WHEN HE'S BEEN TO THE SUPERMARKET

FORTY FIVE TICKETS AT A FIVER EACH AND ARE NOW READY TO SERVE LUNCH 
BUT LUNCH ISN'T READY TO BE SERVED 
IT'S SEPARATING YOUR CHICKEN'S PROBABLY COOKED BUT YOUR SAUCE IS A BIT CRAP

EDIBLE 
THE FOOD LOOKS LIKE IT'S VOMIT I HATE BEING ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO 
SAY I TOLD YOU SO BUT FROM DAY ONE I SAID WHY ARE WE DOING A BOLLYWOOD THEME FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS

HOW ON EARTH DID WE THINK WE COULD SECOND GUESS MAKING FOOD 
FOR ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE IT'S NOT LIKE A MEAL FOR TWO SARA TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FOOD 
SARA DIDN'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY SHE DID AS FAR AS THE KITCHEN'S CONCERNED 
I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE'S TRYING TO POINT THE FINGER AT SARA 
MAYBE IT'S SOME PEOPLE'S STRATEGY IN THIS COMPETITION 
IF WE LET SOMEBODY FUCK UP THEN THEY'RE GOING TO GET VOTED OUT 
IT'S A TEAM EFFORT 
I'M NOT AN EXPERT BY ANY MEANS 
I DID NOT SAY I'M AN EXPERT 
FOR ME STAYING AS A TEAM AND PERFORMING AS A TEAM KEEPS YOU OUT OF THE BOARDROOM 
I WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE RESPECT FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN BE A TEAM PLAYER AND ALSO SHINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL 
AT THE END OF THE DAY YESTERDAY WAS A BLOODY SHAMBLES 
AN HOUR INTO LUNCH AND THE BOYS HAVE RUN OUT OF KEY INGREDIENTS 
IT MEANS ANOTHER TRIP TO THE SUPERMARKET

THIS IS HOW IT IS I'VE JUST HAD TO GIVE AWAY TWO MAIN MEALS BECAUSE THE 
CUSTOMERS ARE ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED WITH THE FOOD THAT'S GONE OUT THERE

BEFORE PUTTING THEM IN THERE MAKING SURE THAT THE SPAGHETTI IS COOKED 
BUT YOU NEED TO LISTEN KEV JUST SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO ME 
TAKE THAT FEEDBACK ON BOARD AND MAKE SURE WE CHANGE IT LATER

SO 
HOW WAS IAN AS A TEAM LEADER 
DON'T ALL SPEAK AT ONCE GUYS 
YOU'VE GOT A SOLEMN LOOK ON YOUR FACE MR. SMITH 
I THINK SOMETIMES SILENCE IS THUNDEROUS SIR ALAN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
IT MEANS THAT I DON'T THINK IAN WAS A GOOD PROJECT LEADER 
AH HMM 
IAN TELL ME HOW YOU SET ABOUT DIVIDING YOUR TEAM AND WHO DID WHAT 
WE HAD A MEETING TOGETHER SIR ALAN TO DISCUSS SKILLS 
THE DECISION WAS MADE KEVIN STEPPED FORWARD TO BE OUR HEAD CHEF 
AND THE OTHER TEAM WERE FRONT OF HOUSE AND SIMON WHAT DID YOU DO 
I WAS THE BUS BOY SIR ALAN 
THE BUS BOY AND THE PIZZA MAKER I WAS IN THE KITCHEN 
I HEAR THAT YOU'RE A BIT OF A DAB HAND AT CHOPPING ONIONS 
CHOPPER SMITH MAYBE IS THE 
YOUR NEW NAME

LIKES TO GET ON WITH THE PHYSICAL SIDE OF THINGS 
SHOW ME WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO AND I'LL DO IT NOT JUST PHYSICAL ALAN SIR ALAN I BEG YOUR PARDON 
NOT JUST PHYSICAL SIR ALAN 
IF I'M DELEGATED A TASK MY MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE 
FROM BEING MANAGED IN THE FORCES IS THAT SOMETIMES THAT IF YOU THINK 
A DECISION IS WRONG YOU CAN TELL YOUR BOSS WHERE YOU THINK HE'S GOING WRONG 
I FELT THAT WE WASTED TIME AND WE WERE MAKING THE WRONG CALLS 
HMM 
GLAD I ASKED 
NOT A GLOWING REPORT IAN BUT WE WILL SEE WHEN THE NUMBERS COME OUT 
LADIES SARA 
A GOOD TEAM LEADER 
WE DID HAVE A FEW HICCUPS AT THE BEGINNING WHILE SHE WAS FINDING HER FEET BUT ONCE THE INITIAL PERIOD 
WAS OVER SHE WAS REALLY GOOD AND YESTERDAY WAS GREAT 
I GOT THIS TICKET HERE AND IT'S GOT FIVE ON SO YOU SOLD TICKETS UP FRONT YEAH 
ABSOLUTELY AND WHAT WOULD THEY DO WITH THESE TICKETS ONCE THEY COME IN 
BASICALLY THE WHOLE POINT OF THE TICKET IS IT WAS SOLD FOR FIVE WHICH 
WAS TAKEN OFF THEIR BILL SO IT GUARANTEED PEOPLE COMING THROUGH THE DOOR 
DID THEY ALL TURN UP ALL THE TICKETS YOU SOLD 
NO ABOUT FIFTY WERE SENT YOU GOT FIVE FOR NOTHING IN SOME CASES 
MORE FOOL THEM SO TO SPEAK YEAH YEAH HOW MANY DID YOU SELL UPFRONT 
WE SOLD ABOUT FIFTY TICKETS SO YOU HAD ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BEFORE YOU KICKED OFF THEN YES 
WE WERE IN PROFIT SIR ALAN BEFORE WE SOLD OUR FIRST MEAL REALLY 
PROFIT BEFORE YOU SOLD YOUR FIRST MEAL 
SIR ALAN I'D JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT WE DIDN'T PAY FOR THE PRINTING EITHER 
NO I WAS GOING TO SAY IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE YOU SHOULD EITHER 
HOW MANY SERVINGS DID YOU DO 
WE COULDN'T DO LUNCH THERE WAS A MAJOR ISSUE DON'T YOU THINK YOU MISSED A TRICK THERE ABSOLUTELY 
BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY DISHES TO COOK THOSE WE CHOSE WERE DIFFICULT 
IT'S A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT REALLY ABSOLUTELY AN OPPORTUNITY LOST 
O. K. LISTEN I THINK IT'S TIME WE GET DOWN TO THE MONEY HERE 
MARGARET WOULD YOU READ OUT THE BOYS' FIGURES 
RENAISSANCE THE BOYS' TEAM TOOK EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY FOUR POINT NINE SEVEN 
BUT THEY SPENT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THREE SO THEIR PROFIT WAS THREE HUNDRED ONE POINT NINE SEVEN 
RIGHT AND NICK 
ALPHA TOOK SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
BUT THEY SPENT IN TOTAL ONE HUNDRED NINETY POINT SEVEN THREE 
WHICH GENERATED A PROFIT OF SIX HUNDRED FOUR POINT TWO SEVEN 
OH SO THE LADIES WON 
GOOD WELL DONE O. K. I'VE LAID ON A TREAT FOR YOU 
NOW IT'S QUITE INTERESTING CONSIDERING THE TASK WE'VE JUST DONE 
THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY MANOR THAT I'VE LAID ON AND THERE'S 
AN EXCELLENT CHEF THERE WHO IS GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO COOK 
O. K. HAVE A NICE TIME 
OFF YOU GO 
IAN 
YOU LOST 
A WORD THAT IS NOT IN YOUR VOCABULARY I UNDERSTAND 
A WORD SIMILAR TO IT SIR ALAN YES 
YEAH GO AND HAVE A DISCUSSION 
AND I'LL CALL YOU BACK IN HERE AND WE WILL GO INTO A LOT MORE DETAIL 
AND SEE WHICH ONE OF YOU IS GOING TO BE FIRED 
O. K. OFF YOU GO 
FOR THE WINNERS SOME PROPER COOKING AT A WORLD FAMOUS COOKERY SCHOOL 
REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE AND OBVIOUSLY IT WAS GREAT WINNING BUT IF THE BOYS HAD JUST WORKED OUT THEIR COSTS 
WE WOULDN'T HAVE PASSED BECAUSE I DON'T THINK SARA AS A PROJECT MANAGER DID A GREAT JOB 
HI HELLO LADIES LOOK WHAT WE GOT 
EXCELLENT AND WE ARE GONNA BE DOING A MENU TODAY COMPRISING OF CRUMBLE 
MADE WITH THE FRUIT THAT YOU'VE JUST GATHERED FROM THE ORCHARD 
THESE ARE AMAZING THINK OF THE HOUSEWIVES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THIS WILL CHANGE THEIR LIVES 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR EFFORT 
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU PUT SO MUCH EFFORT INTO MAKING THIS BOLLYWOOD NIGHT A SUCCESS 
THANK YOU 
CHEERS 
FOR THE LOSERS A MUG OF TEA 
SUGAR 
YEP CHEERS SUGAR 
WE LOST 
ERM 
SORRY LADS REALLY 
I'M HAPPY TO TAKE SOME OF THE BLAME I'M PROJECT MANAGER 
BUT THE OVERALL BLAME LIES WITH KEVIN IN MY OPINION 
I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED THAT WE TOOK THAT MONEY AND LOST 
I'M SO GUTTED THAT WE TOOK THAT MONEY AND LOST 
I'M NOT VULNERABLE AT ALL I'M NOT GETTING FIRED 
I'M NOT CONCERNED IN ANY WAY 
I KNOW SIMON IS SHITTING HIMSELF AND IAN IS COMPLETELY CRAPPING HIMSELF 
I DID A GREAT JOB I'VE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 
THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL ON THEIR COSTS 
I DON'T THINK COSTS COSTINGS EVER OCCURRED TO THEM IN THE WHOLE THING 
THEY SPENT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY COMPARED TO THE ACTUAL TAKINGS 
WORKING HARD BUT TO NO AVAIL BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING 
AND THEY TOOK MORE THAN THE GIRLS YEAH HIGHER TAKINGS 
IT'S THE DEFINITION OF A BUSY FOOL ISN'T IT 
YEP I'M AFRAID SO BUSY FOOLS 
FRANCIS CAN YOU SEND THE CANDIDATES IN PLEASE THANK YOU 
SIR ALAN WILL SEE YOU NOW 
RIGHT IAN I'LL TELL YOU WHAT ANNOYS ME ABOUT THIS LOSS 
IS THIS IS THE EPITOME OF BLOWING INTO THE WIND 
BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND YOU TOOK EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY FOUR 
YOU ACTUALLY WORKED HARD 
YOU WERE BEAVERING AWAY AND WHAT WAS THE END RESULT 
NOTHING REALLY BECAUSE YOU MADE FATAL ERRORS THAT'S WHAT ANNOYS ME 
WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF HOW MUCH WE SHOULD MAKE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BUY 
YOU KNOW THE PRICING AND ALL THAT STUFF CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THAT 
IN TERMS OF THE COSTING OF THE MENU AND SUPPLIES THAT WAS 
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HEAD CHEF SIR ALAN SO KEVIN 
YOU CAN PULL FACES BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HERE IS WHAT WENT WRONG 
I NEVER WANTED TO BE HEAD CHEF AND I FEEL IT WAS A WAY OF SHIFTING 
RESPONSIBILITY TO ME FOR THIS TASK BECAUSE IAN WASN'T PREPARED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AS PROJECT MANAGER 
I DID A GREAT JOB IN THE KITCHEN THE CIABATTAS SOLD LIKE HOT CAKES 
I ALSO MADE A CARBONARA THAT I'VE NEVER MADE IN MY LIFE WHICH EVERY SINGLE PERSON 
TOLD MAKE IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST CARBONARAS THEY'VE EVER TASTED 
I PREPARED FOOD TO A VERY HIGH STANDARD BUT I NEVER SAID 
NOT A HIGH STANDARD YOU HAD COMPLAINTS LUNCHTIME 
IAN WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE CONTROL OF THIS 
SIR ALAN I TRIED MY BEST TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION 
BY APPOINTING KEVIN AS HEAD CHEF HOW DID YOU DEAL WITH COSTINGS 
FROM MY RECOLLECTION YOU FIXED THE PRICES AT WHICH YOU WERE GOING TO SELL 
BEFORE YOU HAD ANY IDEA AT ALL OF THE QUANTITIES YOU WERE GOING TO SELL 
OR WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO NEED TO BUY TO MAKE THE DISHES 
IS THAT THE WAY COSTING'S NORMALLY DONE 
I EXPECT THE HEAD CHEF TO HAVE QUANTITIES OF INGREDIENTS FOR THE DAY'S SERVICE 
YOU KEEP BOUNCING IT OVER TO KEVIN YOU'RE THE BOSS YOU KNOW RIGHT 
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T HAVE SOME FORM OF CONTROL 
AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE COSTINGS 
JUST TELL ME WILL YOU SIR ALAN NUMBERS WEREN'T DONE UNTIL AFTER THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
FOR THE MARGINS TO BE WHERE THEY NEEDED TO BE TO COME BACK IN HERE WITH A BIG ENOUGH PROFIT 
YOU DON'T THINK YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS FAILURE 
APART FROM ECHOING AGAIN AND TELLING ME KEVIN WHO ELSE 
I THINK I WAS HINDERED THROUGHOUT THE TASK BY SIMON'S 
DIFFICULT COMMUNICATION STYLE SHALL I SAY 
WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT SIMON 
I AM DOING SOMETHING 
IF I WANT TO MAKE A POINT TO IAN I HAVE TO ATTEMPT TO HAMMER IT HOME 
WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER BEFORE SOMEONE WILL LISTEN TO ME 
I FELT INVISIBLE WE WERE SAT IN A CAR WITH THE PHONE JUST TALKING 
THE OTHERS WERE CONTROLLING IAN THEY WERE SPENDING MONEY 
ON MARKETING MATERIALS I HAD TO STAY IN TOUCH 
WHAT COULD BE MARKETED WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE HAD TO BUY 
WE NEEDED TO CRUNCH THE NUMBERS DOWN SO WE HAD THE AMOUNTS 
HE JUST GRABBED ME AT ONE POINT AND SAID STAY POSITIVE AND TRUST ME 
I NEED YOU TO STAY POSITIVE BUT I HAD NOTHING TO STAY POSITIVE ABOUT 
LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION YOU SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON MARKETING 
HOW MUCH DO YOU RECKON YOU SPENT ON MARKETING TOTALLY SIR ALAN IT WAS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO 
IT WAS SPENT ALTOGETHER ON MARKETING AND DRESSING THE TABLES AND THE FRONT OF HOUSE 
FOR EXAMPLE THE GIRLS AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD GOT THEIR PRINTING DONE FOR NOTHING 
DON'T YOU THINK YOU OVERSPENT A LOT ON THE MARKETING SIDE 
SIR ALAN WITHOUT THAT MARKETING WE WOULDN'T HAVE GOT 
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY CAME TO OUR RESTAURANT IT WAS AN OVERSPEND 
A TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY 
WE'VE GOT SEVERAL PROBLEMS HERE 
ONE IS WE OVERSPENT ON MARKETING AND TWO IS WE BOUGHT TOO MUCH FOOD BUT THE THIRD ONE 
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS IS THAT THE MARGINS WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH ANYWAY 
ON THE STUFF YOU DID BUY YOU DIDN'T APPLY 
THE SIMPLE PRINCIPLE OF MULTIPLYING BY TWENTY FIVE FOR YOUR RETAIL PRICE 
I MADE A DECISION FOR THE PRICES OF THE FOOD 
I HAD TO MAKE THAT DECISION BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO GET THE MENUS PRINTED AND THERE WAS PROCRASTINATION 
SO YOU PUT THE PRICE DOWN AND DAMNED WHETHER YOU KNEW YOU COULD MAKE IT 
I DID I PLUCKED THE PRICE 
IS THAT CLEVER YES NO IT'S NOT CLEVER 
I'M STARTING TO WORRY HERE THAT I HAVE IN FRONT OF ME 
SEVEN PEOPLE WHO TELL ME THEY HAVE SOME BUSINESS ACUMEN ABOUT THEM 
I CAN'T SEE ANY ON THE TABLE HERE TODAY 
I CAN'T SEE ANY ON THE TABLE HERE TODAY 
NONE WHATSOEVER 
THIS STUFF IS SO SIMPLE SO FAR 
SO SIMPLE 
I AM SO BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED LOOKING AT YOU SEVEN HERE 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT A BLOODY CLUE 
NOT A BLOODY CLUE 
IAN YOU TELL ME WHICH TWO PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO BRING BACK INTO THIS BOARDROOM 
SIR ALAN KEVIN AND SIMON 
KEVIN AND SIMON O. K. ALL RIGHT 
YOU OTHER FOUR GO BACK TO THE HOUSE 
YOU THREE GO OUTSIDE AND I'LL CALL YOU BACK IN SHORTLY 
NOT ONE OF THEM SEEMS ON THIS PARTICULAR TASK TO HAVE ANY BUSINESS ACUMEN WHATSOEVER 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
I THINK KEVIN WAS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVER ORDERING 
THAT I WOULD PUT AT HIS DOORSTEP 
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM SAT DOWN AND THOUGHT LET'S COST THIS 
THEY PICKED THEIR MENU THEY DECIDED WHAT THEY'D SELL IT AT AND THEY WORKED OUT WHAT THEY'D NEED TO BUY 
TOO LATE THERE WAS NO PROPER ORGANISATION 
ANYWAY WE'LL SEE WE'LL CALL THESE THREE BACK IN 
AND WE'LL GET DOWN TO IT FINALLY AND ONE OF THEM HAS GOT TO GO 
HELLO YES SEND THE THREE OF THEM IN PLEASE YES SIR ALAN 
SIR ALAN WILL SEE YOU NOW 
THE FRUSTRATION IS AS I SAID EARLIER ON THAT YOU TOOK THE MOST AMOUNT OF MONEY 
THAT'S WHAT ANNOYS ME 
IT ANNOYS ME AS WELL SIR ALAN ENORMOUSLY 
WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT SIMON IN HERE THEN 
WHAT HAS HE DONE WRONG 
SIR ALAN HE WAS POINTING OUT CONSTANTLY PROBLEMS PROBLEMS 
PROBLEMS BUT I WASN'T HEARING ANY SOLUTIONS ANY HELP I NEEDED AS MUCH HELP AS I COULD GET 
AND POINTING OUT PROBLEMS IS AN EASY THING 
I NEED PEOPLE TO HELP ME WITH HOW TO GET OVER THEM 
I REALLY FELT LIKE I WASN'T GETTING ANY HELP FROM YOU SIMON I REALLY DID 
LISTEN SIMON IT'S ALL VERY WELL MOANING AND COMPLAINING 
BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENT 
NOT THIS IS NO GOOD WE'RE OUT OF CONTROL THIS IS NOT HAPPENING 
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE 
I DID POINT OUT SPECIFIC PROBLEMS 
I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS GOING TO COST US TO MAKE A PORTION 
AND WHAT PROFIT WE'D MAKE SELLING IT RIGHT I KNEW THAT YOU KNOW 
IF YOU BUY A LOAF OF BREAD FOR FIFTY PENCE AND YOU BUY A JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER FOR A POUND 
YOU'VE SPENT ONE POINT FIVE OH BUT YOU COULD MAKE TWENTY FIVE PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICHES AND SELL THEM AT ONE POINT FIVE OH 
I KNOW THAT'S HOW FOOD WORKS AND I KEPT LABOURING THIS POINT 
AND NO ONE WAS LISTENING NO ONE WAS LISTENING TO ME 
WHY DO YOU THINK HE'S BROUGHT YOU BACK IN HERE 
I DON'T KNOW BUT IT SAYS EVERYTHING ABOUT IAN'S MANAGEMENT STYLE 
THAT THE TWO PEOPLE HE'S BROUGHT IN ARE THE TWO PEOPLE UNDER HIS DIRECT CONTROL 
KEVIN 
YES SIR ALAN HEAD CHEF 
YOU SAY NO I SAID I'D COOK 
I DIDN'T WANT THE TITLE OF HEAD CHEF AND YOU DON'T FEEL 
THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF WORKING OUT THE COMPONENTS 
OR THE INGREDIENTS THAT GO INTO THE PRODUCT WERE DOWN TO YOU ABSOLUTELY NOT 
I ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH THE CONCEPT OF HAVING ITALIAN 
I EAT IN A LOT OF ITALIAN RESTAURANTS AND I KNOW WHAT'S POPULAR I PHONED THE RESTAURANTS 
YOU TOOK RESPONSIBILITY SORRY TO INTERRUPT FOR THE MENU I TOOK RESPONSIBILITY 
SO YOU DESIGNED THE MENU I DESIGNED THE MENU BECAUSE I EAT IN ITALIAN RESTAURANTS 
I SAID TO IAN THESE ARE THE PRICES IAN WAS HAPPY WITH THOSE 
IAN THEN PHONED THEM THROUGH TO THE OTHER TEAM 
AND THE OTHER TEAM SAID IT'S FAR TOO EXPENSIVE I DON'T THINK THEY'LL SELL FOR THAT 
AND THEY OVER RID IAN'S DECISION FOR PRICING I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BEG TO DIFFER I'M AFRAID 
YOU TELL ME THEN THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT WAS IAN 
NO DECISIONS IAN YOU LET THE OTHER TEAM I DIDN'T ABSOLUTELY NOT 
YOU LET THE OTHER TEAM DICTATE EVERY DECISION ABSOLUTELY NOT 
I'VE HEARD OF REMOTE MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE 
IAN'S MANAGEMENT WAS NON EXISTENT 
AT FIVE O'CLOCK YESTERDAY AFTERNOON 
THAT PLACE TOOK EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY EXCUSE ME I DIDN'T INTERRUPT YOU YOU DON'T INTERRUPT ME 
AT FIVE O'CLOCK YESTERDAY AFTERNOON I WAS SO CONCERNED AT THE LACK OF LEADERSHIP 
I TOOK EVERYONE OUTSIDE AND I GAVE THEM A MOTIVATIONAL TALK 
YOU DID YES I DID 
I HAD TO TAKE CHARGE OR IT WOULD HAVE FALLEN APART NO IT WOULDN'T 
YOU HAD NO LEADERSHIP SIR ALAN I WAS AT THE SAME MEETING I DIDN'T INTERRUPT YOU LET ME SPEAK 
THAT'S OUR LEADER I WAS AT KEVIN'S MEETING HE HAD NO LEADERSHIP SKILLS 
DID HE CALL THE TEAM OUTSIDE AND HAVE A PEP TALK 
HE DIDN'T SIR ALAN THAT'S NOT TRUE HE EITHER DID OR HE DIDN'T COME ON HE DIDN'T 
HE DID NO HE DIDN'T I DID 
YOU WEREN'T IN THE PEP TALK I WAS IN THE MEETING SIR ALAN ABSOLUTELY 
BUT HE DIDN'T DO IT 
KEVIN DIDN'T GET THE TEAM TOGETHER NO 
THE TEAM ALL AGREED 
HANG ON HE SAID TO ME I CALLED THE TEAM TOGETHER AND I GAVE THEM A PEP TALK 
THOSE WERE HIS WORDS YOU'RE SAYING HE DIDN'T LOAD OF R. U. B. B. I. S. H. 
THIS IS VERY CONFUSING FOR ME AND IT'S A TOSS UP BETWEEN WHO I BELIEVE 
THIS GENTLEMEN OVER HERE SEEMS TO CONCUR WITH HIM 
IT'S NOT LOOKING GREAT 
WHY SHOULDN'T I FIRE YOU EVERYTHING I'VE DONE HAS BEEN IN AN HONEST FASHION 
I WORK TO VERY HIGH MORALS AND I'M AN HONEST INDIVIDUAL 
THE PUB TOOK OVER EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY OF FOOD IN ONE NIGHT O. K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT TEAM 
THEY'RE NOT VERY PROUD OF YOU 
SIMON WHY SHOULDN'T I FIRE YOU 
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE BEST OF ME YET 
I WILL GRAFT IN ANY TEAM YOU PUT ME IN GRAFT YEAH I KNOW YOU GRAFT 
I WANT YOU TO SEE MY OTHER TALENTS I'M NOT HERE 
THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR 
BUT CAN YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE WHICH IS INSPIRATIONAL CAN YOU INSPIRE 
I CAN INSPIRE I HAVE IDEAS 
I'M PERCEPTIVE I'M SHREWD 
I CAN LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE OF THE TASK 
PUT ME IN CHARGE OF SOMETHING SIR ALAN 
IAN 
SOME VERY STRONG ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT YOUR POOR MANAGEMENT 
OF THIS TASK 
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK POSSIBLY THERE'S NO SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE 
KEVIN YOU SPEAK A GREAT GAME 
SIMON 
I AM LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT NECESSARILY 
GOOD AT CHOPPING UP ONIONS 
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO'S GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES 
PLEASE GIVE ME A CHANCE I'M TALKING I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR PHYSICAL TASKS 
AND THAT'S WHAT'S CONCERNING ME ABOUT YOU 
HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN PHYSICAL ABILITY 
YES SIR ALAN I HAVE IDEAS I'M TALKING NOW I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE FROM YOU O. K. 
YES SIR ALAN 
SIMON YOU'RE STAYING 
IAN THIS WAS A TOTAL DISASTER 
QUITE FRANKLY I THINK YOU LOST IT 
IAN YOU'RE FIRED 
SIMON I THINK YOU SITTING HERE 
IS A BIT UNFAIR 
AT THE MOMENT BUT I'LL BE LOOKING TO YOU ONE DAY TO SHOW ME SOMETHING MORE THAN CHOPPING ONIONS 
YES SIR ALAN 
BOTH OF YOU BACK TO THE HOUSE 
THANK YOU SIR ALAN 
AT THE HOUSE THE CANDIDATES WAIT FOR THE SURVIVORS TO RETURN 
THERE WAS AS HEAD CHEF SUPPOSEDLY AND PROJECT MANAGER IN THE SAME KITCHEN 
AND IT STILL WENT TITS UP SOMEONE'S GOT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S WHAT WE HAD 
I THINK SIMON WILL COME BACK MOST DEFINITELY 
I THINK HE'S THE WORKING CLASS LAD WITH SUBSTANCE 
I THINK IAN MESSED UP THIS TASK BUT I THINK HE'S GOING TO GO FURTHER IN THE COMPETITION THAN SIMON 
TO BE HONEST IF IT WAS ON HARD WORK WE WOULD HAVE WON THE TASK 
WHO'S AT THE DOOR 
IAN WAS A DEAD MAN WALKING 
I KNEW STRAIGHTAWAY HE WAS GOING TO GO 
IT WAS IN THE WAY I DID IT 
I WENT IN THERE LET IAN SPEAK I JUST NAILED HIM TO THE GROUND 
IT DISAPPOINTS ME THAT WE TOOK SO MUCH THAT WE DID SO MANY COVERS WE WORKED SO HARD AND DIDN'T WIN 
ABSOLUTELY BUT THAT'S BECAUSE ELEMENTARY MISTAKES WERE MADE BY MY HEAD CHEF 
THERE'LL BE NO TEARS NO ANGER BECAUSE I TRUST MYSELF TO DEAL WITH WHATEVER HAPPENS IN LIFE 
I CAN DEAL WITH THIS COS I'M AN ACHIEVER 
ONE JOB NOW THIRTEEN CANDIDATES REMAIN 
SIR ALAN'S SEARCH FOR HIS APPRENTICE CONTINUES 
NEXT WEEK ON THE APPRENTICE 
I HAVE FOUND YOU ONE OF THE BIGGEST SHOPPING CENTRES IN ENGLAND 
YOU'RE GOING TO PHOTOGRAPH CUSTOMERS 
BUT WILL THE JOB FOCUS THE TEAMS 
OR WILL SIR ALAN BE LOOKING AT A ROOM FULL OF NEGATIVES 
HOW DARE YOU OH FOR CHRIST'S SAKE 
I'M SICK OF LOOKING AT YOU AT THE MOMENT GET OUT THAT DOOR 
YOU'RE FIRED
