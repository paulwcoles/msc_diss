OF HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE NEW REALLY CERTAINLY 
IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ARE AND WHO YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH 
TALULLAH TALULLAH COME OUT YOU CAN PLAY POUNCE AND PRANCE WITH US 
O. K. JUST HOLD ON THERE YOU CHEEKY CHEETAH

MAMA MIRABELLE'S HOME MOVIE TIME 
ROAMING FRIENDS LEND ME AN EAR 
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT CALL ROAM OVER HERE 
EVERYBODY'S WELCOME ONE AND ALL 
SO SWING SWOOP SWAGGER OR CRAWL 
TO MAMA MIRABELLE'S BIG HOME MOVIE SHOW 
FIREFLIES LIGHT IT UP 
THIS MOVIE IS CALLED GETTING TO KNOW YOU 
SOME ANIMALS ARE VERY OUTGOING 
AND THEY TRY TO MAKE FRIENDS BY JUST JUMPING ON YOU AND SAYING HI 
LIKE THIS LITTLE MONKEY HE'S VERY FRIENDLY 
AND HE LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS TO BE LEFT ALONE YOU'RE RIGHT 
SOME ANIMALS LOVE TO PLAY SO MUCH THEY MAKE FRIENDS BY WRESTLING 
NOW THAT LOOKS FUN 
OR BY MORE WRESTLING THAT'S NOT FAIR HE'S TOO BIG 
OR BY PLAYING WHO CAN CLIMB ON TOP OF EACH OTHER FIRST 
THOSE ARE MY COUSINS AT MY LAST BIRTHDAY PARTY 
LOTS OF OTHER ANIMALS SHOW HOW MUCH THEY LIKE EACH OTHER 
BY LICKING AND CLEANING EACH OTHER THAT'S CALLED ALLOGROOMING 
IT LOOKS LIKE KISSING YES IT DOES 
LOTS OF ANIMAL MUMS GROOM THEIR LITTLE ONES 
TO KEEP THEM CLOSE AND CLEAN WHAT A CUTE BABY MOUSE 
EVEN WHEN OLDER ANIMALS GROOM EACH OTHER TO MAKE EACH OTHER FEEL BETTER 
OR TO SHOW EACH OTHER HOW MUCH THEY CARE LIKE THESE CHIMPS ARE DOING 
THE NEXT TIME WE SEE TALULLAH GRAB HER BY THE NECK AND WRESTLE HER 
THEN YOU CAN LICK HER ALL OVER AND PICK BUGS OFF HER 
HOLD ON FELLAS NOT EVERYONE WANTS YOU JUMPING ON THEM OR LICKING THEM 
THIS OTHER FILM IS CALLED ME MYSELF AND I 
OH HE'S SO CUTE THE PANDA LIVES BY HIMSELF 
UP IN THE MOUNTAIN FORESTS OF CENTRAL CHINA 
HE CERTAINLY LIKES TO EAT DOESN'T HE YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN 
A GROWN UP PANDA SPENDS MOST OF THE DAY EATING 
AND THEY EAT ONLY ONE THING BAMBOO 
BAMBOO FOR BREAKFAST AND BAMBOO FOR LUNCH 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT PANDAS HAVE FOR SUPPER FISH AND CHIPS 
NO MORE BAMBOO 
PANDAS ARE SO SHY THEY DON'T SPEND MUCH TIME WITH OTHER PANDAS 
INSTEAD THEY RUB UP AGAINST TREES AND LEAVE A SPECIAL SMELL 
AND THAT'S HOW PANDAS GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER WITHOUT MEETING 
LOOK AT THIS LITTLE FELLA IT'S A HERMIT CRAB HE CERTAINLY IS SHY 
DOES HE ALWAYS HIDE IN HIS SHELL ONLY WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS AROUND 
THE HERMIT CRAB DOESN'T EVEN GROW HIS OWN SHELL 
INSTEAD HE FINDS EMPTY SNAIL SHELLS AND CRAWLS INSIDE THEM TO HIDE 
HE CAN EVEN WALK AROUND WITH IT ON WOW THEY MUST BE STRONG 
AND AS HE GROWS BIGGER 
HE CHOOSES BIGGER AND BIGGER SHELLS THAT HE CAN FIT INSIDE THEM 
HE SOUNDS CLEVER TOO 
NOW HERE'S A WONDERFUL ANIMAL WHO'S ALSO VERY SHY 
OH LOOK THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE TALULLAH 
TORTOISES ARE SHY AND LIKE TO TAKE THEIR TIME DOING THINGS 
SOMETIMES THEY JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE 
LIKE I SAID JUST LIKE TALULLAH 
TORTOISES PULL THEIR LEGS AND HEADS INTO THEIR SHELLS 
UNTIL EVERYTHING CALMS DOWN THAT'S WHAT SHE DID 
FOR A TORTOISE IT'S THE SAME AS SHUTTING THE DOOR 
AND PUTTING UP A SIGN THAT SAYS PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB 
LOOK THAT'S MY FRIEND FRED I THINK HE WANTS TO PLAY WITH THAT TORTOISE 
BUT THAT TORTOISE DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY WITH FRED 
BECAUSE EVERY ANIMAL HAS HIS OR HER IDEA OF HOW TO HAVE FUN 
SO IF TALULLAH PULLS INTO HER SHELL 
MAYBE YOU WERE ACTING TOO ROWDY FOR HER 
AND MAYBE SHE DIDN'T LIKE YOU JUMPING AROUND SO MUCH OH 
I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
SO HOW DO WE PLAY WITH HER 
WHY DON'T YOU BE GENTLE AND FRIENDLY AND JUST ASK HER 
IF YOU LIKE WE CAN PRACTISE MAKING A NEW FRIEND PRACTISE 
YES HERE'S HOW 
NICE TO MEET YOU MY NAME IS MAMA 
NICE TO MEET YOU MY NAME'S MAX 
HELLO MY NAME IS BO 
KEEP GOING SHAKE PAWS OR TRUNKS OR HANDS WITH SOMEBODY 
NICE TO MEET YOU BO THE PLEASURE'S ALL MINE 
HELLO TALULLAH
