TONIGHT'S ACTION AND ITALIAN 
LEGEND ZOLA ALL ON INSIDE SPORT 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO INSIDE SPORT 
WITH ME GABBY LOGAN IS THIS THE 
NIGHT MANCHESTER UNITED WON THE 
TITLE CHELSEA DREW WITH WIGAN WITH 
A LATE EQUALISER WE WILL SHOW YOU 
THE GOALS IN A MINUTE THEY COULD 
HAVE DONE WITH A ZOLA TONIGHT 
CHELSEA'S BEST LOVED PLAYER TALKS 
TO ME ABOUT FOOTBALL AND FOREIGNERS 
THE SOUTH AFRICA PONT DE GREEN 
JACKET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY 
YEARS BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE 
BRITISH CHAMPION IN AUGUSTA NICK 
FALDO GIVES US HIS INSIDE 
THERE IS 
SOMETHING ABOUT AUGUSTA YOU HIT 
ONE BAD SHOT AND IT CHANGES YOU 
GIVES US HIS INSIGHT YOU BASICALLY 
GET THE SHAKES OUT THERE IT SCARES 
YOU YOU THINK WHAT ON EARTH HAS 
HAPPENED 
AND THE MAN WHO WANTS TO HAPPENED PUT JOE CALZAGHE ON THE CANVAS 
STEVE BUNCE HANGS UP WITH JOE 
HOPKINS HOPKINS WITH ME TONIGHT THE MAN PACKING A 
PUNCH STEVE BUNCE OF THE 
INDEPENDENT AND DES KELLY OF THE 
DAILY MAIL WHO GIVES AS GOOD AS HE 
GETS LET'S START WITH CHELSEA AND 
THE TITLE HOPES HAVE BEEN SEVERELY 
CHALLENGED TONIGHT AS THEY FAILED 
TO BEAT WIGAN AT STAMFORD BRIDGE 
THERE IS A FIVE POINT GAP BETWEEN 
THEM AND MANCHESTER UNITED LET'S 
HAVE A LOOK AT A LOOK AT THE 
ACTION PETR CECH BACK IN ACTION 
SOONER THAN EXPECTED NICOLAS 
ANELKA HAD A GOOD CHANCE CHRIS 
KIRKLAND TIPPING IT OVER THE BATH 
OVER THE BAR CHELSEA WENT AHEAD 
WITH A MICHAEL ESSIEN GOAL THEY 
COULDN'T HOLD ON DESPITE SEN'S 
BEST EFFORTS MICHAEL ESSIEN'S 
BEST EFFORTS EMILE HESKEY GAVE 
WIGAN THE POINT OF COURSE THAT 
MEANS THERE IS THERE ARE FIVE GAP 
BETWEEN THEM AND MAN UNITED IT 
LEAVES AVRAM GRANT SCRATCHING HIS 
HEAD HE WILL BE WORRIED ABOUT HIS 
JOB AND THE TITLE THE TEAM TO 
MIGHT START TO PUT NINE FOREIGN 
PLAYERS BUT IN NINETY NINE CHELSEA BECAME 
THE FIRST TEAM TO FIELD A TEAM 
WITHOUT AN ENGLISHMAN CELLAR IS 
STILL LIGHT OF THE PITCH JUST AS 
MUCH AS HE WAS ON IT ZOLA IS 
STILL LIKE TO OFF THE PITCH LIKE 
IT LIKEED 
AFTER SEVEN YEARS AT CHELSEA ZOLA 
HAS TURNED HIS HAND TO COACHING 
ITALIAN UNDER TWENTY ONES WOULD ALSO COMES 
TO LONDON TO COULD FOOTBALL FANS IN 
SPORT BUT HE WAS VOTED BEST 
CHELSEA PLAYER EVER THE CURRENT 
CLIMATE SHOWS UPON SHONE FOR 
ITALIANS IN THE GUISE OF ENGLAND 
MANAGER FABIO CAPELLO WAS THAT THE 
DECISION THAT SURPRISED YOU GIVING 
THE JOB TO AN ITALIAN 
YES BECAUSE 
I KNOW THAT IN ENGLAND YOU DON'T 
LIKE TO GIVE THE ROLE TO A FOREIGN 
MANAGER I'M NOT SURPRISED THEY 
GAVE IT TO CAPELLO L. KNOW THAT 
THEY WANT THE BEST FABIO CAPELLO 
IS ONE OF THE BEST MANAGERS 
IF THE 
BOOT WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT AND AN 
ENGLISH MAN WAS APPOINTED COACH IN 
ITALY WHAT THE WHAT WOULD THE 
REACTION BE 
I'M SURE WE WOULD TAKE 
IT WELL WE ARE LESS AGAINST 
FOREIGN PLAYERS OR MANAGERS IT IS 
IN OUR CULTURE TO HAVE PEOPLE FROM 
ABROAD IN FOOTBALL 
BUT IT 
OBVIOUSLY IS THE ABSOLUTE OPPOSITE 
IN THIS COUNTRY WE LOOK BACK TO 
THAT TIME IN CHELSEA IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE FOR 
THE FIRST TIME AN ENGLISH TEAM 
FIELDED AND ALL FOREIGN SIDE WHICH 
WE YOU WERE PART OF 
MAYBE IT IS 
TOO MUCH YOU WERE PART OF WE 
HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM IN ITALY NOT 
AS MANY BUT WE ARE CLOSE THAT IS 
NOT VERY GOOD A I SAID IT MANY 
TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE FOREIGN 
PLAYERS THEY ARE GOOD ONES LIKE 
MARADONA A BIG INFLUENCE TO MY 
GAME BUT NOWADAYS YOU HAVE TOO 
MANY 
DO YOU THINK IT IS THE MANY QUALITY 
EXACTLY NOT ALL OF THEM QUALITY ARE TOP QUALITY THOSE MEDIUM 
PLAYERS ARE TAKING THE PLACE OF 
YOUNG PLAYERS COMING THROUGH SO SO YOU ARE IN FAVOUR OF A QUOTA SYSTEM 
WHERE THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE LIMIT TO 
THE NUMBER OF FOREIGN PLAYERS YES YES WHAT DO YOU THINK GOOD FOREIGN 
PLAYERS BRING TO THE PREMIERSHIP 
IT GIVES A VARIETY TO THE GAME FOR 
THE YOUNG PLAYERS LEARNING THE GAME 
THEY ARE THE BEST CONDITIONS TO 
GROW UP AND TO BE BETTER PLAYERS 
AND WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST INFLUENCES 
ON YOUR CAREER 
I WOULD SAY 
MARADONA HE WAS MY MAESTRO YOU 
KNOW 
I HAVE TO SAY IT WAS VERY 
DIFFICULT TO HAVE A LIFE LIKE 
MARADONA HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING 
HE COULDN'T GO OUT OF HIS HOUSE 
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS AROUND HIM 
ON THE PITCH HE WAS FANTASTIC HE 
WAS VERY SIMPLE ONE THING THAT 
IMPRESSED ME THE MOST WAS HIS 
SIMPLICITY IN FOOTBALL YOU COME 
TO A STAGE IN WHICH IT SEEMS YOU 
HAVE REACHED THE TOP THAT YOU CAN 
GET IT IS AT THAT MOMENT THAT YOU 
HAVE TO CARRY ON WORKING AND PUT IN 
SOMETHING MORE AN EXTRA THOUGHT 
THE BEST PLAYER THEY COME IN AND 
ALWAYS COME FROM PLACES WHERE THE 
CONDITIONS ARE VERY DIFFICULT 
THOSE CONDITIONS THEY EACH EACH 
YOU TO BE A FIGHTER TO WORK HARD 
AND CARRY ON THEY TEACH YOU 
NEVER GIVE UP 
AS WE HAVE GOT MORE 
AFFLUENT IN THIS COUNTRY BOW 
LEVELS OF ACHIEVEMENT HAVE GONE 
DOWN IN FOOTBALL BECAUSE THERE 
WAS NO FIGHT OUR LEVELS 
SOMETIMES IN THIS COUNTRY YOU 
HAVE EVERYTHING TO BE SUCCESSFUL 
YOU HAVE THE SUPPORTERS THE MANIC 
MONEY THE PICTURES THE BIG 
PLAYERS THEY ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING 
MORE THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE IT AND 
THEY FIGHT FOR IT THEY HAVE THEY 
ARE LIKE LIONS INSIDE NOWADAYS NOWADAYS YOU SEE PLAYERS IN THIS COUNTRY EIGHTEEN 
NINETEEN ON RIDICULOUS MONEY THE CARS 
THE LIFESTYLE THE DRINKING CULTURE 
THAT STILL SEEMS TO BE PREVALENT 
WITHIN THE GAME AND OBVIOUSLY THERE 
WERE INCIDENTS AT CHELSEA WHEN YOU 
WERE THERE IS IT DIFFERENT IN 
ITALY ARE WE IMAGINING EVERYWHERE 
ELSE IS BETTER 
SOMETIMES IT HAS 
BEEN TRUE L. FELT SORRY FOR SOME 
PLAYERS THEY HAD GOOD TALENT 
SPOILING THEIR TALENTS MAYBE NOT 
CARING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT 
THEMSELVES THEIR PHYSIQUE 
IT IS 
SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IN YOUR 
LIFE 
A SHORT PERIOD AND YOU HAVE LIFE TO CARE ABOUT YOURSELF ABOUT YOUR 
BODY 
A GOOD CORNER BUT STILL TURNED IN 
BRILLIANTLY BY ZOLA EXTRAORDINARY 
FINISH FROM GIANFRANCO ZOLA MACRO 
GIANFRANCO ZOLA 
WE HAVE READ YOU 
WERE OFFERED A POSITION AT 
NEWCASTLE UNITED 
YES IT WAS 
SOMEBODY ELSE CONTACTED ME IF I 
WANTED TO DO SOMETHING FOR 
NEWCASTLE UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE 
COMMITMENTS WITH THE FEDERATION L. 
LIKE TO CARRY ON WHAT I AM DOING 
DID IT IN TO RESCUE THOUGH THE 
PROSPECT OF WORKING FOR AN ENGLISH 
CLUB 
DID IT IN TO RESCUE YES CLUB CERTAINLY IT WOULD BE SOMETHING I 
WOULD LIKE DID IT INTEREST YOU 
BUT BUSY FOR THAT 
YOU HAVE ALREADY 
TURNED DOWN ABRAMOVICH TO WORK FOR 
CHELSEA 
YES MR. ABRAMOVICH WAS CHELSEA GOOD TO ME HE TRIED TO TAKE ME 
BACK 
TRIED TO BUY THE CLUB 
NO BACK DON'T KNOW I DON'T THINK SO HE 
HAS BEEN GOOD AS I SAID TO HIM 
MAYBE IN THE FUTURE BUT RIGHT NOW 
I DID FEEL READY TO WORK FOR A CLUB 
SO YOU COULD SEE YOURSELF WORKING 
FOR ABRAMOVICH AT SOME STAGE MAYBE MAYBE SO 
WERE YOU SURPRISED TO SEE JOSE SO MOURINHO LEAVE CHELSEA 
YES A 
DIDN'T EXPECT HIM TO LEAVE THAT 
EARLY I KNEW THERE WERE FEW 
PROBLEMS 
AVRAM GRANT SEEMS TO BE PROBLEMS DOING A SIMILAR JOB PEOPLE TALKED 
ABOUT THE FACT ABRAMOVICH WANTED A 
MORE ATTRACTIVE STYLE OF FOOTBALL 
THEY ARE PLAYING A PRETTY SIMILAR 
STYLE WHO IS DOING A BETTER JOB 
YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT FIVE YEARS 
AGO SEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN I CAME 
IT WAS EASIER TO PLAY NICE FOOTBALL 
EVERY TEAM YOU WERE FACING PLAYING 
AGAINST HE WAS WILLING TO PLAY HIS 
OWN GAME NOWADAYS WHEN YOU PLAY 
CHELSEA THE FIRST THING THEY THINK 
IS TO DEFEND 
WHEN YOU CAME TO THE 
PREMIERSHIP DID YOU THINK YOU HAD 
ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD ON THE 
BALL 
YES L. HAVE TO SAY YES IN BALL ITALY THE DEFENCE WAS A VERY TIGHT 
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND SPACE IN 
ATTACK 
SO YOU ENJOYED YOUR ATTACK EXPERIENCE 
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW EXPERIENCE MUCH I ENJOYED IT IT WAS A GREAT 
EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE SO MUCH LOVE AND WARMTH COULD 
CHELSEA DO WITH A BIT OF THAT 
PARTICULARLY RIGHT NOW AFTER 
TONIGHT'S RESULT YOU COULD BE 
LOOKING AT THE NEXT BOSS MAYBE IT 
IS TOO SOON BUT CERTAINLY IN THE 
FUTURE THE FANS WOULD WELCOME HIM 
WITH OPEN ARMS BECAUSE THEY ADORE 
HIM HE IS PROBABLY THE MOST 
OVERSEAS PLAYERS THROUGHOUT THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE'S HISTORY 
I THINK 
HE WAS OFFICIALLY VOTED THE MOST 
POPULAR PERSON 
AWAY FANS USED TO 
APPLAUD HIM 
TO HIS CREDIT HE IS 
LEARNING HIS TRADE WITH THE ITALIAN 
UNDER TWENTY ONES HE IS A LOYAL MAN AND HE 
WILL NOT JUMP SHIP EASILY 
WE KNOW 
HE WAS SPOKEN TO IN OCTOBER HE 
ASKED FRIENDS OF HIS AT THE CLUB 
THEY TOLD HIM IT IS AN UNHAPPY 
REGIME HERE HE DIDN'T SAY NO UNTIL 
THE WAITED FOR A BIT OF FEEDBACK 
HE IS A VERY LOYAL PLAYER THAT IS 
WHY CHELSEA FANS LOVE HIM BUT 
AFTER TONIGHT LOYALTY IS LOYALTY 
FOR ONE THING HE WOULD BRING WHICH 
EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR AT CHELSEA 
IS A BIT OF STARDUST HE HAD IT AS 
A PLAYER AND HE HAS IT AS COACH 
HE IS THE KIND OF FIGURE WHETHER 
HE IS THE GUY IN DURABLE 
CHELSEA ARE DURABLE AND RESILIENT 
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A TALISMANIC 
KEEGAN LIKE CHARACTER AVRAM GRANT 
IS NOT THAT CHARACTER BUT HE IS 
INCREDIBLY MOROSE ALL OF THE 
AVERAGE GRANT STUFF FROM SEPTEMBER 
AND OCTOBER L. FEAR FOR THE BACK 
PAGES TOMORROW 
WE SAW HIM SHAKING 
HIS HEAD HE HAS APPARENTLY SAID HE 
HAS NOT BLOWN IT HOPING THAT 
MANCHESTER UNITED WILL DROP POINTS 
SAYING THAT AT THIS STAGE IN THE 
SEASON 
THEY COULD GO TO STAMFORD SEASON BRIDGE NOW AND LOSE AND STILL WIN 
THE TITLE BASICALLY IT IS THEIRS 
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE SITUATION 
FOR ONCE WE HAVE KNOWN UNITED 
SHOULD GET THE TITLE NOW ARSENAL 
HAVE FALLEN AWAY IT IS GUARANTEED 
AVRAM GRANT'S FATE LIES IN THE 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE MATCH 
HE MAY 
KEEP HIS JOB YOU SAY IT IS AN 
INCREDIBLE SITUATION ONE MANAGER 
AT A SEASON 
THIS GUY COMES IN IN 
SEPTEMBER HE TAKES THEM TOOK THE 
CARLING CUP FINAL THEY LOSE AT 
THAT STAGE CRUCIAL PLAYERS LIKE 
BALLARD AND LAMPARD HAD PLAYED SIXTEEN 
MINUTES TOGETHER IN TEN MONTHS O. K. 
HE WHEELS THEM ON HE GETS THEM 
INTO SECOND PLACE TONIGHT THEY 
ARE PLAYING FOR A REALISTIC CHANCE 
TO OVERTURN MANCHESTER UNITED AND 
THEY NARROWLY FAILED THEY ARE IN 
THE SEMI FINALS OF THE CHAMPIONS' 
LEAGUE BUT I BET YOU CAN'T FIND 
ANYBODY ELSE SIGHT OF AVRAM GRANT'S 
HOUSE GIVING HIM THE CHANCE OF 
STAYING IN THE JOB AFTER JUNE FIRST 
RESULTS PLAYING STYLE TACTICS 
ONCE THE RESULTS GO IT ALL COMES 
BACK IN HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT HE 
WILL BE DONE NEXT SEASON HE WILL 
BE GENERAL MANAGER AND THERE WILL 
BE A MORE CHARISMATIC COACH 
I THINK HE IS IN A SORT OF 
ASHTON SLASH DUNCAN FLETCHER SITUATION 
HE HAS EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS AND 
THEY ARE STUCK WITH HIM 
IT IS THE 
ONE YEAR MERCENARY MANAGER WIN WIN WILL TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN SOME TIME 
SOON COMING UP LATER IN THE 
PROGRAMME STEVE SHOWS BERNARD 
HOPKINS THE SITE AND SMELLS OF 
LONDON 
IN IS LIKE A CELL DOOR WHY LONDON DO YOU THINK I AM STAYING HERE 
IT WAS ANOTHER THRILLING MASTERS AT 
AUGUSTA AS TREVOR IMMELMAN BECAME 
THE FIRST SOUTH AFRICAN TO PUT ON 
THE GREEN JACKET FOR THIRTY YEARS 
TIGER'S GRAND SLAM DREAM IS OVER 
THE BRITS IAN POULTER AND JUSTIN 
ROSE ARE WERE ALL IN CONTENTION 
BUT DESPITE A GREAT SHOWING THEY 
ALL FELL AWAY WATCHING WAS THREE 
TIMES MASTERS WINNER ENCOURAGE 
EUROPEAN RYDER CUP CHAMPION NICK 
FALDO WHO NOW WORKS AS A 
COMMENTATOR FOR A U. S. NETWORK HAZEL 
IRVINE ASKED HIM CONNELL WHAT WENT 
WRONG WITH THE BRITISH CHALLENGE 
SHE ASKED HIM 
THE GUYS WERE GOING VERY WELL FOR A 
WHILE IT WAS LOOKING GOOD IAN 
POULTER AND CASEY AND ALL SORTS 
THE EUROPEAN CONTINGENT WAS GOOD 
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT 
AUGUSTA GET ONE BAD SHOT AT THE 
WRONG TIME AND IT CHANGES YOU 
MENTALLY YOU CAN GET THE SHAKES 
OUT THAT BECAUSE IT SCARES YOU 
YOU THINK WHAT ON EARTH HAS 
HAPPENED AND YOU LOOK AT THE GOLF 
COURSE DIFFERENTLY YOU HAVE TO 
HAVE INCREDIBLE SELF BELIEF THAT 
YOU CAN DO THINGS 
DO YOU SEE IT IN 
THE UN BRITISH PLAYERS A DASH IN 
THE YOUNG BRITISH PLAYERS 
BY THAT 
IS THE THIN YOU DO NOT EXPECT TO 
GET THE TRUTH OUT OF ANYBODY WHAT 
IS IN A MAN'S HEART AND IN HIS GUTS 
ARE HIS OWN PERSONAL FEIN BUT I 
THINK YOU CANNOT SURVIVE THIS GAME 
WITHOUT TALENT AND THE GUYS 
REALISE THAT TIGER HAS RAISED THE 
BAR IF YOU WANT TO COMPETE YOU 
NEED THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SIDE 
THESE GUYS ALL WANT IT TO HAPPEN 
IT IS THAT SELF BELIEF I HAVE DONE 
THE WORK ONE DAY I WILL PULL IT 
OFF 
NOT MUCH TEST OF SELF BELIEF OFF THAN THE RYDER CUP YOU HAVE TAKEN 
ON THIS ROLE WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE 
BEEN NOTHING BUT TROUBLE SINCE YOU 
SAID YES NOT A QUITE 
YOU CAN PICK 
THE COLOUR OF THE SHIRTS THINGS 
LIKE THAT BUT FOR SOME REASON THE 
MEDIA WANTS TO GET BETWEEN ME AND 
THE PLAYERS NOW THEY HAVE HAD AN 
OPPORTUNITY THE CAPTAIN PAUL 
AZINGER OF THE AMERICAN TEAM HAVE 
THROWN MUD AT EACH OTHER L. HAVE 
BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK ENOUGH TIMES 
TO SAY I KNOW WHAT MY ROLE IS FOR 
THE WEEK L. KNOW 
WHAT I CAN DO AND WHAT I CAN BRING TO THE TEAM AM 
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT L. LOVE THE 
CHALLENGE I AM SURE WE WILL HAVE A 
WONDERFUL WEEK 
AS FOR YOUR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH MONTY THERE WAS 
A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT 
WERE SAID LAST AUTUMN 
THINGS WERE 
TALKED ABOUT OF COURSE WE WANT HIM 
PLAYING IN TOP FORM HE HAS BEEN 
OFF FORM FOR A WHILE HE HAS FOUR 
AND A HALF MONTHS TO GET INTO IT 
HE WILL BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE 
TEAM 
WHAT ABOUT THE ACTUAL PROCESS TEAM OF LOOKING AT THE GUYS SEEING WHAT 
THEIR FORM IS LIKE HOW MUCH TIME 
IS IT TAKING UP 
I AM ENJOYING IT 
THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY ROLE L. AM 
ABLE TO WANDER DOWN THE RANGE AND 
CHAT TO GUYS EUROPE IS IN A VERY 
STRONG POSITION WE HAVE AT LEAST 
TWO DOZEN GUYS VYING FOR THE TOP 
SPOT IF WE CAN GET IN THE BRITISH 
OPEN THAT IS WHEN I WILL START 
TAKING NOTE OF WHAT IS GOING ON ON 
SUNDAY AFTERNOONS WHO IS MOVING UP 
AND DOING WHAT L. HAVE TO LOOK AT 
WHAT I HAVE GOT IN THE TEAM AND 
WHAT I CAN ADD TO IT RIGHT NOW IT 
IS STILL UP IN THE AIR L. HAVE NO 
PRECONCEIVED IDEAS IN THE LAST 
MONTH IT WILL EITHER BE A VERY 
SIMPLE PICK OR WHICH WILL STRESS 
ME OUT YOU NEVER KNOW 
WE SAW IAN 
WOOSNAM AND SANDY LYLE YOU WERE 
TEMPTED TO GET THE LANDZAAT AGAIN 
NO I AM NOT L. AM VERY COMFORTABLE 
WITH MY NEW ROLE TEMPTED TO GET 
THE IRONS OUT L. HAVE HAD MY PLAY 
IN DAY L. DO NOT WANT TO GO OUT FOR 
FUN BECAUSE THIS PLACE SCARES THE 
LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF YOU NOW 
GOT NERVOUS PLAY THE PAR THREE 
CONTEST SO I AM VERY HAPPY WITH 
THIS NOW CROWD AROUND TRYING TO 
HIT FANCY SHOTS WITH PEOPLE AROUND 
YOU HAS GOT SCARY SO MY DAYS OF 
GOING ON TO THE BE CAUSE FOR THE 
BIG BOYS ARE DONE 
YOU HAVE PLAYED 
YOUR LAST MASTERS 
I DO NOT KNOW 
WHETHER THAT WILL TOTALLY HAPPEN L. 
AM NOT SURE WHETHER I WOULD LIKE 
ONE LAST WALK L. HAVE AN AWFUL LOT 
OF EXCUSES BUT MAYBE I MIGHT SAY I 
WOULD RATHER HAVE WAS REMEMBERED 
FOR MY SIXTY SEVEN A A FEW MOONS BACK L. 
WOULD REMARKED RATHER REMEMBER 
THAT THAT IT IS VERY INTERESTING THAT IT IS 
FOR A HALF MONTHS AWAY AND ALREADY 
THERE IS A WAR OF WORDS STARTING 
THERE IS A WAR OF WORDS STARTING WITH FALDO AND BASINGER HE IS 
COMING OUT ALMOST VERBATIM WITH THE 
FULL LIST OF INSULTS THAT FALDO 
THREW AT TEN PAUL AZINGER HE HAS 
CLEARLY NOT FORGOTTEN WHICH MAKES 
IT MORE EXCITING THAN IT HAS BEEN 
IT HAS 
BEEN A BIT ONE SIDED IT HAS BEEN IN THE U. S. INTEREST TO SERVICE 
UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN GETTING 
A 
IN THE LAST FEW 
A POUNDING IN THE LAST FEW TOURNAMENTS IT IS IN THEIR 
INTEREST TO STIR THIS UP NICK 
FALDO AND THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER 
WHEN HE WAS PLAYING HE PLAYED TO 
WIN HE WAS NOT PLAYING TO WIN 
FRIENDS HE UPSET PEOPLE NOW HE IS 
HAVING TO BE MORE DIPLOMATIC IF 
EUROPE ARE BEHIND AT THE END OF DAY 
ONE THAT VENEER OF DIPLOMACY WILL 
CRACK AND WE WILL GET A REAL RYDER 
CUP 
THAT IS WHAT PAUL AZINGER SAID CUP WHAT HE SAID WAS UNSUITABLE EVEN 
FOR A PROGRAMME GOING OUT AT 
ELEVEN THIRTY P. M. BUT HE SAID HE WAS 
QUESTIONING FATHER'S PERSONALITY 
WHILE COMMENTATING FILED A.'S 
PERSONALITY NICK FALDO'S 
PERSONALITY 
HE WAS DRIVEN AND PERSONALITY FOCUSED IF ONLY HE HAD SOME OF 
THAT NOW 
THAT IS PAUL AZINGER'S 
WAY OF ASSESSING HIS PERSONALITY 
HE MENTIONS TWO DOZEN PLAYERS TO 
CHOOSE FROM WILL THE RUTHLESS NICK 
FALDO SOFTENED AND BRING ON MONDAY 
EVEN IF HE IS NOT UP THERE WITH THE 
BEST 
I HAVE A FEELING EVEN IF BEST MONTY'S FORM IS NOT GOOD I THINK 
MONTY IS A BIT OF A TALISMAN IF 
YOU GET HIM IN HE CAN PULL OUT ONE 
FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE WHICH COULD 
INSPIRE THE TRAVELLING BRITS AND US 
WATCHING AND THE REST OF THE TEAM 
I KNOW HIS FORM IS NOT GREAT BUT 
THERE IS THAT TIME TO PULL HIM OUT 
FOR ONE LAST GO 
HE WILL NOT 
YOU DOWN BUT HE IS A LONG WAY FROM 
THE FORM REQUIRED TO COMPETE AT 
THAT LEVEL L. AM NOT SURE HE WOULD 
GET ON WITH NICK FALDO ANYWAY 
THERE WERE CRITICISMS AND THAT 
STILL RUMBLES ON 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
BRITS WHEN IT COMES TO THE RYDER 
CUP THE BRICKS AND EUROPEANS CAN 
TURN IT ON THE AMERICANS HAVE 
TENDED NOT TO ENJOY THAT TEAM 
MENTALITY 
YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED THE MENTALITY REASON THE EUROPEAN TEAM ENJOYS 
THE JOUSTS THEY ENJOY THE ONE ON 
ONE CONFRONTATION AND THE TEAM 
CONFLICT WHEREAS IN A MAJOR 
TOURNAMENT YOU ARE BATTLING WITH 
YOURSELF LET'S NOT MAKE OUT THE 
MASTERS AS A GREAT TRIUMPH FOR 
AMERICA SOUTH AFRICA WATER WE HAVE 
WITH THE GREEN JACKET 
THE WE HAVE 
HAD BRITS AT THE TOP OF THE 
LEADERBOARD BUT THEY COULD NOT DO 
IT IN THE FINAL FURLONG 
CASEY HAD 
A DISASTER ON THE LAST DAY 
DROPPING FIVE SHOTS IN FOUR HOLES 
SOMETHING TERRIBLE THERE SEEMS TO 
BE A DEBATE AMONGST THE GOLFING 
EXPERTS ON WHETHER THEY HAVE THE 
BOTTLE OR WHETHER IT IS A CASE AS 
NICK FALDO AND ALMOST CAUGHT HIM 
MY PAL NICK AS NICK FALDO WAS 
SAYING YOUR HEART CAN BE BROKEN ON 
A COURSE LIKE THAT 
SHE DAY TOUGHEN 
UP 
THE HAVE TO TOUGHEN UP THROUGH UP THE YEARS THEY ARE YOUNG KIDS L. 
HAVE DONE A BIT OF RESEARCH AND 
SINCE TIGER WOODS WON HIS FIRST 
MAJOR ELEVEN YEARS AGO THERE HAVE BEEN 
FORTY FOUR WINNERS OF MAJORS SINCE THEN 
ONLY FOUR OF THEM WERE YOUNGER THAN 
TIGER WOODS 
THAT IS GOOD RESEARCH 
ON SATURDAY JOE CALZAGHE WILL PUT 
HIS FORTY FOUR FIGHT UNBEATEN RECORD ON THE 
LINE IN HIS FIRST LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT 
BOUT HIS OPPONENT THE AMERICAN 
BERNARD HOPKINS HOPKINS HAYLES 
FROM THE MEAN STREETS OF 
PHILADELPHIA HE HAS BEEN STABBED 
THREE TIMES AND WAS SENTENCED TO EIGHTEEN 
YEARS IN JAIL FOR ROBBERY WITH 
VIOLENCE WITH THAT BACKGROUND HE 
SAYS CALZAGHE HOLDS NO FEARS FOR 
HIM AND CONTROVERSIALLY THAT HE 
WOULD NOT LOSE TO A WHITE BOY BUT 
HOPKINS IS ALSO KNOWN IN HIS 
NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR GIVING BACK TO 
HIS COMMUNITY STEVE HAS BEEN 
HANGING OUT WITH HIM ANY MAN CAN UNDERESTIMATE ANY MAN 
COMING OUT ON THE STREETS THERE IS 
SO MUCH ROOM FOR ERROR SO MUCH 
ROOM FOR MISTAKES L. BECOME WHO I 
BECAME WITHOUT HAVING TITLES AT THE 
TIME WITHOUT HAVING MEANS AT THE 
TIME IT IS TESTIMONY TO MY 
CHARACTER MY SPIRIT MY DRIVE 
APRIL NINETEENTH WE GOT GREAT FIGHT 
AMONGST TWO LEGENDARY FIGHTERS L. 
AM TELLING EVERYBODY TO WATCH THE 
EDUCATION OF THE BRIT 
THERE IS A GUY THAT HAS BEEN 
STABBED THREE TIMES AND I AM LIN

EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN ALL THE WAY TO 
WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN BEFORE I GOT IN 
TROUBLE YOU ARE GETTING OLDER AND 
THE LESSONS KICKING IN THINGS THAT 
YOUR MOM COULD NOT AFFORD BECAUSE 
SHE HAD TO RAISE FIVE TO SIX KITS 
YOU START SAYING I WANT THIS I 
WANT THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF 
THINGS A LOT OF BAD JUDGMENT IT 
WAS LIKE A POT BOILING OVER WHEN WHEN YOU WERE A BOXING WHEN YOU WERE 
YOUNGER THEN YOU STOPPED AND GOT 
INTO ENOUGH TROUBLE TO GET SENT TO 
JAIL WHEN YOU WERE VERY YOUNG THEN 
YOU STARTED BOXING AGAIN IN THE 
PENITENTIARY SYSTEM THAT MUST HAVE 
BEEN HARD 
ABSOLUTELY YOU GOT GUYS 
THAT DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THEIR SPOT 
TO A NEW GUIDE THAT IS COMING IN 
ESPECIALLY A YOUNG ONE 
EXACTLY SO 
I HAD TO FIGHT THE TOUGHEST 
BADDEST GUY IN THE SUPER 
MIDDLEWEIGHT DIVISION 
THE UNKNOWN IS ALWAYS AROUND THE 
CORNER AND PRISON ANY SECOND ANY 
MINUTE YOUR LIFE IS IN JEOPARDY 
BECAUSE YOU ARE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT 
THAT YOU CANNOT LEAVE OR ESCAPE IF 
YOU JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE TEN YEARS 
YOU GOT TEN YEARS IF WE DO NOT GET 
TO MONDAY WE WILL GET YOU TUESDAY 
IF WE DO NOT GET YOU IN JANUARY WE 
WILL GET YOU IN FEBRUARY 
DID IT GIVE YOU INSIGHT IN PRISON

EASY AS IT COULD INSIDE 
IT GAVE EIGHTY 
PER CENT OF RESPECT THROUGH GUARDS AND 
THREE INMATES THE OTHER PRESENTED 
WAS PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO BE AROUND 
YOU FOR PROTECTION OR BECAUSE YOU 
WERE A POPULAR GUY IT WAS THAT 
AMONGST A SMALL WORLD WITHIN ITSELF 
WHEN THEY TOLD YOU THAT THEY WERE 
GONNA PUT A PAINTING UP A MILL UP 
WERE YOU SHOCKED WHEN YOU SAW HOW 
GRAND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE 
IT WAS GREAT THING 
THOUSANDS OF 
INMATES WERE GOING TO COME THROUGH 
THERE THEY MIGHT BE INSPIRED BY A 
FUTURE HALL OF FAME THAT OF WHO HAS 
COME THROUGH THOSE SAME ADVERSITIES 
THE GREATEST THING IT LOOKED JUST 
LIKE ME IT WAS NOT A BAD ARTIST 
YOU WANT TO BE GREAT DO GREAT 
THINGS 
THAT IS WHY HE IS COMING THINGS I DO NOT THINK HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT 
TO DO THE FIGHT PERSONALLY I 
THINK THERE WAS NOWHERE ELSE TO GO 
IT IS NO BIG SECRET DOLE IS 
FIGHTING HOPKINS BECAUSE EVERYBODY 
ELSE HAS GOT BEATEN BY ME SO I AM 
THE LAST MAN EVERYTHING HAS FULL 
CIRCLE TO IT IT IS HEAVY DOOR 
OH IS THERE IS NOW IN THERE

LIKE A CELL DOOR 
THAT IS MY PIECE 
IN IT 
EXACTLY BELIEVE THAT ALL 
THIS WAS SCRIPTED FROM MY CHILDHOOD 
DAYS OF IGNORANCE TWO MAC 
ADOLESCENTS IN THE PENITENTIARY 
AS YOU VISIT AND SEEN HARDCORE MEN 
IN THEIR LOVE ME AND CRY FOR ME 
JOE HAS NOT FIGHT MANY PEOPLE WITH 
MY CREDIBILITY AND WHAT I HAVE DONE 
WITH MY RESIN MAY SURPASSES 
EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE WITH MY 
RESUME 
I GOT THE WHITE ONE I GOT A WHITE 
ONE I HAD TO COME HERE TO SEE THE 
PRICE ON IT THIS IS THE 
MANUFACTURER 
THIS IS A SPECIAL MANUFACTURER TRIP THIS IS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND IN AMERICA 
YEAH 
HOW MUCH IS IT TWO HUNDRED TEN 
YOU HAVE YEAH TWO HUNDRED TEN GOT THE RESPECT HOW DO YOU KEEP 
THE DRIVE 
PRESSURE ON ME TO 
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST WIN L. 
FIGHT TRAIN SLEEP MOTIVATE 
MYSELF WHEN YOU PUT YOURSELF IN A 
POSITION TO SAY THINGS THAT ARE SO 
CONFIDENT AND SO DARING AND 
WALKING THAT LINE YOU MUST WIN 
YOU MUST DELIVER 
I'VE BEATEN YOU ALREADY 
IT WAS ALL 
GOOD NATURED AND GOOD FUN THEN YOU 
SUDDENLY TURNED 
I WOULD NEVER LET 
A WHITE BOY BEAT ME L. WOULD NEVER 
LET A WHITE MAN BEAT ME 
IS THAT 
THE SAME KIND OF PSYCHOLOGY I I WOULD NEVER LET A WHITE BOY BEAT ME 
IT IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE 
HOUNDED BY IF PETER BEATS ME FROM 
THE SUBURBS AND BIG JOHN HIT ME 
AROUND THE CORNER IN THE 
NEIGHBOURHOOD THE SAME BLACK EYE 
FROM BIG JOHN THAT I GOT THE SAME 
BLACK EYE TRUST ME I'D RATHER 
HAVE A BLACK EYE BY JOHN BIG JOHN 
YOU CAN WALK AROUND WITH A BADGE OF 
HONOUR PEOPLE EXPECT YOU TO GET A 
BLACK EYE WITH BIG JOHN BUT NOT 
PETER HUNT PADDICK THAT IS NOT 
SAYING PETER HUNT THAT IT CAN'T 
FIGHT IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK GOOD 
WE AIN'T FIGHTING NOW L. HAVEN'T 
GOT TO STARE LIKE A PIT BULL MY 
TRACK RECORD SHOWS THAT NOT ONLY 
CAN I TALK THE TALK BUT UNLESS YOU 
ARE DELUSIONAL OR DON'T WANT TO 
REMEMBER I HAVE WALKED THAT WALK 
FOR MANY YEARS THAT IS MY TRACK 
RECORD IT IS CALLED CREDIBILITY 
TALK WITH CONFIDENCE TRAINED WITH 
CONFIDENCE SPEAK WITH CONFIDENCE 
BUT WHEN THE DOOR IS SHUT THE 
LIGHTS GO OFF I ALWAYS KEPT IT IN 
MY MIND AND HEART THAT NO MATTER 
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT A PERSON YOU 
MUST TRAIN LIKE YOU ARE NOT IN THE 
DARK 
THIS IS LIKE A NEXT STEP UP FROM
