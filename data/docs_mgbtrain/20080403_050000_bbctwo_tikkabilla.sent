H. M. M. ME OR THE SEA 
WE'LL SOON DISCOVER WHO'S BEST COME WE'LL DO A LITTLE TEST

TO TEST HIS PEOPLE'S HIGH BLOWN BOASTS 
THE KING WISHES TO GO TO THE BEACH 
OF COURSE YOUR MAJESTY 
DOES YOUR MAJESTY LIKE THE THRONE 
THE THRONE IS JUST GRAND 
OH GOOD UM YOUR MAJESTY LIKES THE GOLD 
M. M. M. THE GOLD IS GLORIOUS 
OH GREAT AND DOES YOUR MAJESTY LIKE THE VELVET 
THE VELVET IS VERY RED GOOD AND THE PARASOL 
M. M. M. THE PARASOL IS PERFECT GOOD 
A CHAIR 
A THRONE WAS PLACED UPON THE BEACH 
A LITTLE WAY FROM THE WATER'S REACH 
CANUTE LOOKED AROUND THEN POINTED TO THE SAND 
AT THE MOMENT WHAT YOU SEE IS LAND 
BUT IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE THE SEA BEGINS TO CREEP UP ONTO ME 
I WILL TELL THE SEA TO GO 
AND NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS MY TOE 
KING CANUTE YOU ARE THE BEST SO MUCH BETTER THAN ALL THE REST 
KING CANUTE YOU ARE SO CLEVER THE GREATEST THE BEST KING EVER 
NOW IF THE SEA LEAVES THE SAND 
CALL ME THE GREATEST CALL ME GRAND 
BUT IF THE SEA REACHES ME 
COVERS ME MAKES ME SOAKING WET 
YOU'LL KNOW THE SEA IS GREATER YET 
THE WATER ROSE AND STARTED TO EDGE TOWARDS THE KING'S TOES 
SEA LEAVE ME BE SEA LEAVE ME BE 
KING CANUTE YOU ARE THE BEST SO MUCH BETTER THAN ALL THE REST 
KING CANUTE YOU'RE SO CLEVER YOU'RE THE GREATEST THE BEST KING EVER 
CREEPING SEEPING UP THE BEACH 
THE SEA DID NOT LISTEN THE SEA DID NOT HEAR 
LOOK MY PEOPLE LOOK IT IS CLEAR 
THAT THE SEA IS SO MUCH GREATER THAN ME 
OH NO THE SEA WOULD NOT DARE TO RISE UP ON TO YOUR CHAIR 
SEA LEAVE ME BE 
SEA LEAVE ME BE 
KING CANUTE YOU ARE THE BEST SO MUCH BETTER THAN ALL THE REST 
KING CANUTE YOU ARE SO CLEVER 
YOU'RE THE GREATEST THE BEST KING EVER 
THE WATERS LAPPED AROUND CANUTE'S FEET 
AND SWOOSHED AND SWISHED ON TO HIS SEAT 
SEE MY PEOPLE SEE HOW YOU'RE WRONG 
THE WATER IS MUCH TOO FAR TOO STRONG 
OH NO SAID THE PEOPLE 
THE SEA WOULD NOT DARE TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A LOCK OF YOUR HAIR 
SEA LEAVE ME BE SEA LEAVE ME BE 
KING CANUTE YOU ARE THE BEST SO MUCH BETTER THAN ALL THE REST 
KING CANUTE YOU ARE SO CLEVER 
YOU'RE THE GREATEST THE BEST KING EVER 
SPLISHING AND SPLASHING THE WATERS STILL ROSE 
IT STARTED TO TICKLE GOOD KING CANUTE'S NOSE 
LOOK MY PEOPLE LOOK IT IS CLEAR 
THE SEA IS STRONGER GET ME OUT OF HERE 
BACK AT THE PALACE NOW SAFE AND DRY 
CANUTE LOOKED AT HIS PEOPLE AND GAVE A SIGH 
NOW CAN YOU TELL 
NOW DO YOU SEE 
THAT THE SEA IS SO MUCH GREATER THAN ME 
OH KING YOU MAY NOT BE THE GREATEST THING EVER 
BUT GREAT KING 
YOU'RE TERRIBLY CLEVER 
IT DOES NOT MATTER WHO YOU ARE YOU CANNOT TELL THE SEA WHAT TO DO 
EVEN IF YOUR NAME IS KING CANUTE 
OR EVEN TAMBA 
MAYBE WE'LL SEE THE SEA THROUGH THE WINDOWS TODAY 
OR EVEN SOME CREATURES THAT LIVE IN THE SEA 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE 
ARCHED WINDOW 
THIS IS A DOLPHIN THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL CREATURES 
DOLPHINS MIGHT LOOK A BIT LIKE A FISH 
BUT THEY ARE NOT FISH AT ALL THEY HAVE FINS AND A TAIL 
AND THEY SWIM IN THE SEA 
BUT DOLPHINS ARE DEFINITELY NOT FISH 
THEY ARE MAMMALS AND THEY NEED TO BREATHE AIR JUST LIKE WE DO 
DOLPHINS TALK TO EACH OTHER USING SQUEAKING NOISES 
DOLPHINS STAY TOGETHER IN GROUPS CALLED PODS 
THEY TRY TO LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS A DANGEROUS SHARK NEARBY 
SOMETIMES DOLPHINS MAKE BUBBLES IN THE WATER 
JUST WATCH CAN YOU SEE THEM 
THEY ARE VERY PLAYFUL TOO 
LOOK AT THAT ONE CATCHING SOME SEAWEED 
OOPS DROPPED IT 
THIS IS A BABY DOLPHIN 
IT IS LEARNING TO FISH 
THE DOLPHIN IS STICKING ITS NOSE DOWN INTO THE SAND 
TO SEE IF IT CAN FEEL ANY FISH OR SHRIMPS 
HE'S GOT ONE 
NOW IT'S TIME FOR SOME SURFING 
THE REST OF THE POD ARE JOINING IN 
IT LOOKS LIKE FUN 
DOLPHINS ARE GREAT SWIMMERS 
AND GREAT SURFERS T. OOH 
DID YOU SEE THOSE DOLPHINS THEY WERE FANTASTIC 
THEY WERE THEY LOOKED SO GRACEFUL IN THE WATER 
WATER'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US ISN'T IT PAUL 
YOU KNOW TAMBA I WAS THINKING THAT VERY SAME THING 
WATER'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US 
SO IMPORTANT THAT I THOUGHT IT DESERVED A POEM OF IT'S VERY OWN 
I LIKE MAKING UP POEMS 
THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE STORIES THAT RHYME YOU'VE GOT IT 
THE CAT SAT ON THE MAT 
YOU SEE CAT RHYMES WITH SAT AND MAT VERY GOOD TAMBA 
CAT RHYMES WITH SAT AND MAT 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HELP ME FINISH MY POEM 
YES PLEASE WHAT'S IT ABOUT 
IT'S ABOUT WATER AND WHAT LIFE WOULD BE LIKE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY WATER 
BUT MY POEM NEEDS ONE MORE LINE 
MAYBE I COULD HELP YOU HOW DOES IT GO IT GOES LIKE THIS 
DID YOU CLEAN YOUR TEETH LAST NIGHT 
OR DID YOU WASH YOUR HAIR 
DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK THAT WATER'S ALWAYS THERE 
WE USE IT FOR OUR SHOWERS 
ALSO FOR OUR DRINK 
WE EMPTY OUT THE KETTLE 
AND POUR SOME DOWN THE SINK 
WE HAVE FUN WITH WATER INSIDE THE SWIMMING BATHS 
DUCKING DIVING SPLASHING GIVES US LOTS OF LAUGHS 
THE FLOWERS IN THE GARDEN WOULD DROOP THEIR HEADS AND DIE 
IF THEY NEVER HAD A SHOWER OF WATER FROM THE SKY 
THE BIRDS WOULD NEVER HAVE A BATH 
AND THE DUCKS WOULD HAVE NO POND 
THERE WOULDN'T BE A DEEP BLUE SEA FOR SHIPS TO SAIL UPON 
IF YOU TAKE A HOLIDAY AND VISIT THE SEASIDE 
LISTEN FOR THE ROAR OF WAVES THAT COME IN WITH THE TIDE 
OR IF YOU'RE LAYING IN YOUR BED AND HEAR A PITTER PAT 
SNUGGLE UP AND LISTEN IT'S THE RAINDROPS GOING SPLAT 
ALL THESE THINGS AND MANY MORE WITH WATER WE DO SHARE 
BUT IF YOU GO NEAR WATER 
OOH 
IF YOU GO NEAR WATER 
ALWAYS TAKE GREAT CARE 
TAMBA THAT'S BRILLIANT 
THAT'S PERFECT ALWAYS TAKE GREAT CARE 
ALL THESE THINGS AND MANY MORE WITH WATER WE DO SHARE 
BUT IF YOU GO NEAR WATER ALWAYS TAKE GREAT CARE 
THANK YOU THAT'S GREAT 
WE MUST ALWAYS TAKE GREAT CARE AROUND WATER 
WE'VE GOT SOME MORE WATER HERE 
NOW HOW WOULD WE GET ACROSS THIS WATER 
CAN YOU THINK OF A WAY 
WE COULD PADDLE IN THE WATER 
I'LL PUT MY SHOES IN THERE 
H. M. M. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GET MY SHOES WET 
OH I COULD SWIM 
I COULD SWIM THROUGH THE RIVER 
OH THEN I'D GET MY WHOLE BODY WET 
AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WITH A GROWN UP WHEN YOU'RE AROUND WATER 
WE COULD BUILD A BRIDGE 
OF COURSE WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT 
NOW I'VE GOT SOME BIG BOXES HERE 
THAT I GOT FROM THE SUPERMARKET 
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUILD A BIG BRIDGE 
YOU COULD BUILD A SMALL BRIDGE IF YOU WANTED 
THE FIRST THING I'VE DONE 
IS TO PUSH THE SIDES OUT OF THIS BOX 
HELLO 
SO I CAN USE IT AS PART OF MY BRIDGE 
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW I DID THAT 
WITH THIS BOX 
YOU NEED TO 
FOLD 
IF I TURN IT AROUND 
I CAN FOLD THE SIDES IN 
BUT WE NEED TO LEAVE ONE END 
FLAPPING OPEN 
SO THAT WE CAN WALK ACROSS OUR BRIDGE 
NOW I THINK I NEED TO START PUTTING OUR BRIDGE TOGETHER 
OVER HERE TRYING NOT TO FALL INTO OUR RIVER 
AND IF I PUT THAT ONE 
THERE 
NOW THERE'S A BIG GAP HERE SO I NEED A BIT OF CARD 
TO WALK OVER OUR BRIDGE AND I'VE GOT 
THIS BIG PIECE OF CARD 
IF I PUT THAT 
ON THERE 
I CAN HAVE A LOOK THROUGH 
AND I CAN WALK ALL THE WAY OVER THE RIVER 
H. M. M. 
NOW I'VE GOT SOME MORE BOXES 
HERE 
SOME SHOEBOXES 
AND SWEETIE BOXES 
SO I CAN PUT THOSE 
ON TOP 
OF OUR BRIDGE 
THERE A BRIDGE TO GO ACROSS A RIVER 
I WONDER WHERE THIS RIVER LEADS 
WOW 
WHAT A GREAT BRIDGE 
THERE'S A SONG ABOUT A BRIDGE IN LONDON 
CALLED LONDON BRIDGE IS FALLING DOWN WILL I SING IT 
O. K. YOU COULD PRETEND TO BE A BRIDGE OVER A PRETEND RIVER 
I'M GOING TO USE THIS AS MY RIVER 
AND I'M GOING TO PRETEND TO BE THE BRIDGE 
I'M GONNA STRETCH MY BRIDGE BODY OVER THE RIVER HERE WE GO 
WOO OOH OOP 
LONDON BRIDGE IS FALLING DOWN 
FALLING DOWN FALLING DOWN
