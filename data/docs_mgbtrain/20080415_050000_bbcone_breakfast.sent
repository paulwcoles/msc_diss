THE MOST WIDESPREAD DECLINE IN 
HOUSE PRICES FOR THIRTY YEARS 
RETAILERS ARE REPORTING A SLUMP IN 
HIGH STREET SPENDING 
DOWNING STREET SAYS THIS IS JUST A 
ROUTINE MEETING IT'S THE KIND OF 
THING GORDON BROWN DOES ALL THE 
TIME BREAKFAST MEETINGS WITH 
PEOPLE FROM THE CITY BUT IN THE 
CURRENT CLIMATE THERE IS NO SUCH 
THING AS A ROUTINE MEETING AND IT 
COMES AT AL TIME OF GLOOM IN THE 
HOUSING MARKET AND ON THE HIGH 
STREET STREET NOT LONG AGO THE HOUSING MARKET 
WAS BOOMING AND PEOPLE WERE 
SPENDING LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW 
BUT NOW THE PROPERTY MARKET HAS 
STARTED TO TURN CONSUMERS ARE 
TIGHTENING THEIR BELTS FROM YOUR 
STREET TO THE HIGH STREET THE 
ECONOMY IS SLOWING DOWN AT FAULT 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH WHICH HAS SEEN 
LENDERS PUSH UP MORTGAGE RATES A 
NEW SURVEY CLAIMS IT HAS LEFT 
ESTATE AGENTS AT THEIR MOST GLOOMY 
ABOUT THE MARKET FOR THIRTY YEARS THAT 
IS NO SURPRISE TO BRENDAN WHO 
BORROWED HEAVILY TO REVAMP HIS 
BELFAST HOME NOW IT HAS FALLEN IN 
VALUE HE IS IN ARREARS WITH HIS 
MORTGAGE AND HE CANNOT FIND A 
BUYER 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WANTED TO BUYER BUY THE HOUSE THEY JUST CANNOT 
SELL THEIR OWN HOUSE IT IS A CHAIN 
EFFECT 
IT'S DIFFICULT TIMES FOR EFFECT RETAILERS TOO WITH MANY SAYING 
THEIR PROFITS ARE UNDER THREAT 
FIGURES SHOW THAT IN MARCH RETAIL 
SALES FELL BY SIXTEEN PER CENT THE BIGGEST 
FALL IN ALMOST THREE YEARS SOME 
BLAME THE EARLY EASTER OTHERS THE 
POOR WEATHER WHATEVER THE REASON 
IT'S EVIDENCE OF AN ECONOMY THAT IS 
UNDER STRAIN NO ONE KNOWS HOW LONG 
IT WILL LAST OR HOW TOUGH IT'S 
GOING TO BE BUT THE SLOWDOWN IS 
STARTING TO BITE THERE IS MORE 
DIFFICULT NEWS FOR GORDON BROWN 
THIS MORNING THIS IS ABOUT HIS 
TRADE MINISTER LORD DIGBY JONES 
THE FORMER HEAD OF THE C. B. I. WHO WAS 
BROUGHT IN BY GORDON BROWN AS ONE 
OF THESE PEOPLE WHO TRANSCENDED 
POLITICS WHO WAS NOT A MEMBER OF 
THE LABOUR PARTY IT HAS NOW 
EMERGED THAT HE WILL NOT BE 
STANDING BEYOND THE GENERAL 
ELECTION IT IS APPARENTLY BECAUSE 
HE SAYS HE IS NOT A POLITICAL 
FIGURE BUT WE UNDERSTAND FROM 
SOURCES THAT HE TOLD A PRIVATE 
BUSINESS MEETING THAT HE DID NOT 
WANT TO BE ASKED IN PUBLIC WHETHER 
HE SUPPORTED GORDON BROWN NOT WHAT 
GORDON BROWN NEEDS AT THE MOMENT 
THIS MORNING TESCO AND DEBENHAM'S 
WILL BE TELLING US WHETHER THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH HAS AFFECTED THEIR 
SALES MORE ON THAT LATER EIGHT 
SURVIVORS OF THE COACH CRASH IN 
ECUADOR WHICH KILLED FIVE BRITISH 
WOMEN HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THEIR 
ORDEAL THEY SAID THEY WERE HELPING 
EACH OTHER COPE AND WERE LOOKING 
FORWARD TO COMING HOME 
EIGHT OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED THE 
CRASH GATHER IN A ROOM HERE IN THE 
CAPITAL AND CAN SEE ON THEIR FACES 
WHAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH DESPITE 
EVERYTHING EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SARAH SAYS 
GAP YEARS ARE A GREAT EXPERIENCE I I THINK A YEAR OUT HAS A HUGE AMOUNT 
OF BENEFITS AND I THINK A TRAGIC 
ACCIDENT SHOULD NOT BE STOPPING 
PEOPLE FROM ROM TRAVELLING THE 
OTHER FOUR SURVIVORS ARE BEING 
TREATED AT THIS HOSPITAL THEIR 
INJURIES ARE NOT SERIOUS AND THE 
GROUP HAVE FOUND SOLACE BY STICKING 
TOGETHER 
A AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE TOGETHER NINE OF THE TOURISTS IN THEIR HOTEL 
HERE I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH TO THE GOVERNMENT OF 
ECUADOR WHO ARE LOOKING AFTER THEM 
HERE IN THE HOTEL WE'VE GOT FOUR 
PEOPLE ACTUALLY IN HOSPITAL HERE 
NONE OF THEM HAVE LIFE THREATENING 
INJURIES BUT THEY ARE BEING 
TREATED FOR MINOR INJURIES WE WILL 
TALK TO THEM NOW ABOUT WHEN WE CAN 
GET THEM OUT OF THE HOSPITAL THE 
BODIES OF THE FOUR TEENAGERS AND A 
TOUR GUIDE ARE NOW BEING FLOWN BACK 
TO THE CAPITAL THE TWELVE STUDENTS 
SHOULD BE RETURNING TO THE U. K. LATER 
TODAY THEY SAY THEY CANNOT WAIT TO 
BE WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY 
AGAIN INVESTIGATORS SAY THE LORRY 
THAT HIT THE TOUR BUS HAS BEEN 
RECOVERED BUT THE DRIVER IS STILL 
MISSING 
AN IRAQI TEENAGER WHO WAS 
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT BY THE BRITISH 
SOLDIER IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WILL RECEIVE TWO 
MILLION IN COMPENSATION THE BOY 
FROM BASRA SUFFERED SEVERE SPINAL 
INJURIES WHICH LEFT HIM PARALYSED 
WHEN A SOLDIER DROPPED HIS GUN AND 
THE WEAPON WENT OFF SILVIO 
BERLUSCONI HAS WON A THIRD TERM AS 
ITALY'S PRIME MINISTER AFTER 
DECISIVE VICTORY IN THE GENERAL 
ELECTION THE SEVENTY ONE YEAR OLD MEDIA 
BILLIONAIRE WARNED OF DIFFICULT 
MONTHS AHEAD AS HE PROMISED 
DIFFICULT ACTION TO TACKLE THE 
ECONOMY HIS IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES 
ARE THE SALE OF ALITALIA AND THE 
CRISIS CAUSED BY UNCOLLECTED 
WASTING IN NAPLES A POST MORTEM 
WILL BE CARRIED OUT TODAY ON THE T. V. 
PRESENTER ON THE BODY OF THE T. V. 
PRESENTER MARK SPEIGHT HIS FRIENDS 
SAY HE HAD BEEN IN A VULNERABLE 
STATE AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS 
FIANCEE AS PART OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE 
CARBON EMISSIONS TWO YISH PER CENT OF ALL 
FUELS MUST BE MADE OF BIO FUELS 
TWO PER CENT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT TODAY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF 
THE FUEL WE BUY IN THE FORECOURT 
MUST BE MADE OF BIO FUEL JUST A 
FEW YEARS AGO THIS WAS SEEN AS A 
GOOD AND GREEN SOLUTION BUT TODAY 
SOME ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THIS IS 
JUST NOT TRUE THE INDUSTRY DEFENDS 
ITS GREEN CREDENTIALS BUT 
CONSERVATIONISTS WILL TAKE MORE 
CONVINCING 
WHEN YOU FILL UP YOUR CONVINCING CAR THERE MAY BE PALM OIL GOING 
INTO YOUR TANK THAT WAS GROWN 
SOMEWHERE THAT WAS A TROPICAL 
RAINFOREST TWO YEARS AGO THERE IS 
NOTHING BUT GOVERNMENT HAS DONE TO 
STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING THE BIO 
FUELS WE HAVE GOT AT THE MOMENT ARE 
NOT SUSTAINABLE 
MAKE NO MISTAKE BIO FUELS ARE BIG 
BUSINESS THIS SITE IS SET TO 
BECOME A HUGE BIO ETHANOL PLANT 
THE BIO FUEL FROM THIS PLANT WILL 
BE THE EQUIVALENT OF TAKING ABOUT 
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CARS OFF THE U. K. ROADS EVEN 
SO THERE ARE SIGNS THAT CONCERNS 
ABOUT BIO DIESEL ARE SPREADING 
TODAY THE PRIME MINISTER IS 
EXPECTED TO CALL FOR AN URGENT 
REVIEW OF HOW BIO FUEL PRODUCTION 
PLAYS INTO THE GLOBAL FOOD SHORTAGE 
THE POLICE ARE GOING TO THE HIGH 
COURT TODAY TO CHALLENGE THE 
DECISION BY MINISTERS NOT TO BACK 
THEIR LATEST PAY RISE IT IS PART 
OF A CAMPAIGN THAT TOOK THOUSANDS 
OFFICERS ONTO THE STREETS EARLIER 
THIS YEAR THEY SAY THE 
GOVERNMENT'S REFUSAL MEANS AN 
AGREED INCREASE OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IS WORTH 
JUST NINETEEN PER CENT J. K. ROWLING HAS APPEARED 
IN COURT IN NEW YORK TO TRY TO STOP 
THE PUBLICATION OF AN UNOFFICIAL 
HARRY POTTER ENCYCLOPAEDIA SHE 
ARGUED THE BOOK AMOUNTED TO 
WHOLESALE THEFT OF SEVENTEEN YEARS OF HER 
WORK THE WRITER OF THE 
ENCYCLOPAEDIA INSISTS HE IS 
ENTITLED TO CREATE A REFERENCE 
GUIDE TO J. K. ROWLING'S WORK 
PRESIDENT BUSH HAS AGREED TO SPEND 
AN EXTRA ONE HUNDRED MILLION ON HELPING 
PEOPLE HIT BY THE RISING PRICE OF 
FOOD IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD 
PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR 
BASIC FOODSTUFFS AT THE WORLD'S 
STOCK MARKETS COULD BE LESS 
TURBULENT IF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
EMPLOYED MORE WOMEN AND OLDER MEN 
ACCORDING TO A STUDY BY RESEARCHERS 
AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY WHO FOUND 
THERE WAS DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THE 
MATTER OF MONEY TRADERS MADE AND 
THEIR LEVELS OF THE HORMONE 
TESTOSTERONE 
IT'S A HIGH PRESSURE WORLD BUT 
WHAT IS IT THAT MARKS OUT THE 
WINNERS FROM THE LOSERS DEALS ON 
FINANCIAL TRADING FLOORS HELP TO 
DEFINE THE HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY 
BUT WHILE THOSE CRUCIAL DEALS MAY 
BE MADE ON RATIONAL JUDGMENT IT 
MAY ALSO BE GUT INSTINCT OR SIMPLY 
MALE HORMONE LEVELS IT TURNS OUT 
THAT TESTOSTERONE LEVELS CAN MAKE BIG DIFFERENCE 
BUT THE MAN WHO DID THE RESEARCH 
THINKS THAT TESTOSTERONE FUELLED 
TRADING CAN LEAD TO TRADERS TAKING 
EVER HIGHER RISKS AND DRIVING THE 
MARKET TO AN UNSTABLE LEVEL 
IF MY 
HYPOTHESIS IS CORRECT THAT EXTREME 
LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE ARE CAUSING 
STOCK MARKET BUBBLES TO BECOME 
EXAGGERATED THEN ONE OF THE WAYS 
OF DEALING WITH THAT SOURCE OF THE 
INSTABILITY IS TO DIVERSIFY HORMONE 
PROFILES ON THE TRADING FLOOR THAT 
TO ME WOULD MEAN HIRING MORE WOMEN 
AND MORE OLDER MEN THE RESEARCHERS 
HOPE THAT THEIR WORK WILL LEAD TO A 
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MARKET 
BUBBLES AND CRECHES ARE FUELLED 
CRASHES ON BREAKFAST WE ARE 
NEVER SLOW TO MILK GOOD STORY 
HOW ABOUT TRYING THESE MOVES A 
DAIRY FARMER IN DEVON'S SAYS THAT 
ARE PERFORMING TAI CHI IN FRONT OF 
HIS COWS HAS PRODUCED TEN PER CENT MORE MILK

TESTOSTERONE STORY BUT WE HAVE 
ALREADY SEEN IT PERHAPS THE REASON 
WE ARE IN THIS FINANCIAL MESS IN 
THE FINANCIAL TIMES RUSSIAN OIL 
OUTPUT IS REPORTED COULD HAVE 
PEAKED FEARS IF THAT IS THE CASE 
BECAUSE WE ARE ALREADY SEEN OIL 
PRICES TOPPING ONE HUNDRED TWELVE DOLLARS A BARREL THAT

HOUSING MARKET 
THE SURVIVORS OF THE CRASH IN 
ECUADOR ARE EXPECTED TO HEAD HOME 
TO BRITAIN TODAY 
LICENCE TO KILL WHY A VERY LITTLE 
ANIMAL HAS BECOME ENEMY NO ONE 
INDEED I WILL BE TELLING YOU WHY 
THE BATTLE AGAINST THE GREY 
SQUIRREL HAS BEGUN AND WHY THIS IS 
A VITAL TOOL IN THAT FIGHT NOW THE WEATHER 
WE HAVE A FEW GREY FURRY FRIENDS 
SCUTTLING AROUND THE BLUE PETER 
GARDEN THIS MORNING 
NO SURPRISES TO GUESS ABOUT THE 
WEATHER IT IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER 
SHOWERY DAY SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS 
BUT THERE ARE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN 
COMPARISON TO YESTERDAY'S WEATHER 
THERE IS A BIT OF A NORTH SOUTH 
DIVIDE AT THE MOMENT CLOUD 
BRINGING PERSISTENT RAIN INTO 
SCOTLAND BUT AS IT TRAVELS NORTH 
IT WILL FRAGMENT THE RAIN WILL 
PETER OUT QUICKLY BY NINE AM 
OUTBREAKS OF RAIN ACROSS THE 
PENNINES AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
SOUTH OF FAT CLEARER SKIES A VERY 
SUNNY START BUT A CHILLY ONE 
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TO THE SOUTH 
EAST ALONG THE SOUTH COAST INTO 
DEVON AND CORNWALL ONE OR TWO 
SHOWERS CLINGING ON TO THE CARDIGAN 
BAY AREA AND INTO NORTH WALES AND 
THE ISLE OF MAN FROM THAT WEAKENING 
SYSTEM NORTHERN IRELAND OVER THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS THE RAIN 
SHOULD DRIFT SOUTH AND TOO FAR 
NORTHERN SCOTLAND YOU SHOULD GET 
SUNNY SPELLS ALL IN ALL THOUGH 
SHOW WAS WILL DRIFT FURTHER SOUTH 
SLOWLY BUT SURELY INTO THE MIDLANDS 
INTO WALES AND INTO THE FAR NORTH 
OF EAST ANGLIA BY THE END OF THE 
AFTERNOON THE SOUTH EAST CLINGING 
ON TO THE AFTERNOON OVERNIGHT 
THOUGH SHOWERS WILL DRIFT SOUTH 
EAST SO THAT WILL PREVENT THE 
TEMPERATURES FALLING TOO LOW 
FURTHER WEST AND NORTH YOU GO THEY 
MIGHT BE A TOUCH OF FROST MAYBE 
SOME ICY PATCHES WITH SOME RESIDUAL 
SHOWERS LINGERING THE BEST OF THE 
SUNSHINE TOMORROW MORNING IN THE 
NORTH WEST AND THE WEST ONE OR TWO 
SHOW WAS COMING IN OFF THE NORTH 
SEA AND AFFECTING EAST ANGLIA AND 
THE SOUTH EASTERN CORNER L. WILL BE 
BACK WITH MORE DETAILS IN HALF AN 
HOUR HOUR THEY MIGHT LOOK CUTE AND CUDDLY 
BUT IN NORTHUMBERLAND THEY ARE IN 
THE 
THE LINE OF FIRE 
THOUSANDS OF GREY SQUIRRELS HAVE 
BEEN CULLED WHY HAVE THEY BECOME 
THE BADDIES RAYMOND HAS THE 
ANSWERS ANSWERS GOOD MORNING NORTHUMBERLAND IS 
KNOWN AS THE BORDER COUNTRY BUT IT 
IS AN ACTIVE BATTLEGROUND IT IS 
SQUIRREL AGAIN SQUIRREL THE 
FIGHTBACK AGAINST THE SPREAD OF THE 
GREY HAS BEGUN THEY ARE TRAPPING 
THEM IN CAGES LIKE THIS AND THEN 
THEY ARE DISPATCHING THEM ALL OF 
THIS FUNDED BY THE TAX PAYER 
PAUL PARKER DESCRIBES HIMSELF HAS A 
CONSERVATIONIST BUT HE CONSERVES 
BY KILLING HIS PREY IS SMALL AND 
ENDEMIC ACROSS THE COUNTRY HE 
KILLS MACRO SQUIRRELS FOR A LIVING 
THE GREY SQUIRRELS LIKE THIS ONE 
THEY RRY A DISEASE WHICH KILLS 
THE RED SQUIRREL AS SOON AS THEY 
PICK IT UP THE RED SQUIRREL DIES 
WITHIN THREE WEEKS THEY GET INTO 
NEST BOXES AND THEY EAT EGGS IN IN LITTLE OVER A YEAR THIS GOVERNMENT 
SPONSORED TRAPPER HAS CAUGHT AROUND 
SEVEN THOUSAND GREY SQUIRRELS IT IS 
ESTIMATED FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THEM KILLED IN 
NORTHUMBERLAND IN A YEAR THE 
REASON IS TO SAVE THE NATIVE RED 
SQUIRREL ITS NUMBERS ARE TINY IN 
COMPARISON WOODLAND BY WOODLAND 
COUNTY BY COUNTY THE GREY SQUIRREL 
HAVE COLONISED AND DOMINATED 
EVERYONE RECOGNISES THE IMPORTANCE 
OF CONTROLLING THE SPREAD BUT SOME 
BELIEVE THE MASS CULLING IS 
CONTROVERSIAL 
UP UNTIL THE EARLY CONTROVERSIAL NINETEEN SEVENTIES YOU COULD GET A LICENCE TO 
KILL RED SQUIRRELS NOW IT IS GREY 
AGAINST THAT BACKGROUND OF 
TAMPERING AND DRIVING ANIMALS TO 
THE POINT OF EXTINCTION AND THEN 
KILLING THE ANIMALS WHICH ARE 
DRIVING THEM TO EXTINCTION IT IS 
DUBIOUS 
IN NORTHUMBRIA THEY INTEND DUBIOUS TO CONTINUE THE CULL THEY BELIEVE 
THEY ARE CLOSE TO ERADICATING THE 
BREED FROM THE COUNTY AND WHEN THEY 
HAVE FINISHED THEY WILL HEAD SOUTH 
IF YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT HAPPENS 
TO THEM THEY ARE BEING SOLD AS THE 
LATEST DELICACY 
LET PUT SOME OF THOSE FIGURES INTO 
CONTEXT FIFTEEN THOUSAND SQUIRRELS HAVE BEEN 
CULLED IN OVER A YEAR THAT IS 
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED WEEK ONE LOOK AT THE 
PICTURE OF THE NUMBER OF GREY 
SQUIRRELS AND THE UNITED KINGDOM 
THERE ARE UP TO FIVE MILLION OF THOSE 
AND NOW THE NATIVE REDS IN ENGLAND 
THERE ARE ONLY TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND AND 
MOST ARE BASED IN NORTHUMBRIA OR IN 
NEIGHBOURING CUMBRIA SO THIS CULL 
IS CONTROVERSIAL GIVEN THE CONTEXT 
OF THOSE FIGURES IT IS ONLY A SMALL 
NUMBER OF THE OVERALL NUMBER OF 
GREY SQUIRRELS IN THE U. K. COULD COULD THIS CULL SPREAD TO OTHER PARTS OF 
THE COUNTRY 
YOU SAW PAUL PARKER HE IS 
DETERMINED TO CARRY ON KILLING THE 
GREY SQUIRREL IN NORTHUMBRIA HE 
TOLD ME HIS AMBITION WAS TO CLEAR 
EVERY GREY SQUIRREL UNTIL HE GETS 
DOWN TO HYDE PARK IN OTHER PARTS 
OF THE COUNTRY GREY SQUIRRELS ARE 
POPULAR IF HE 
CONTINUE IT IS 
LIKELY TO BE MORE CONTROVERSIAL 
THAN IT IS IN NORTHUMBERLAND WE WE SAW THE SQUIRREL IN THE WINDOW OF 
THE BUTCHERS WHAT DOES IT TASTE 
LIKE 
I DO KNOW IT IS SWEET AND LIKE FROM MY MEMORY OF RABBITS IT 
TASTES A LITTLE LIKE THAT L. AM 
TOLD IT IS VERY POPULAR ONE LOCAL 
POSH RESTAURANT TOOK FORTY SQUIRRELS 
AS A STARTER A WEEK AGO SO THERE 
COULD BE A NEW CULINARY SENSATION 
LET US KNOW WHAT TO THINK NEVER 
KNEW YOU COULD BUY SQUIRREL IN THE 
BUTCHER BUTCHER WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
CULLING GREY SQUIRRELS GOOD BAD 
OR INDIFFERENT 
THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME ON 
BREAKFAST THIS MORNING

THE IMAGES TO REMIND US WHY THERE 
IS NOTHING LIKE HOME SWEET HOME

EVENTUALLY FOUND THE BREAKTHROUGH 
THROUGH MICHAEL ESSIEN THAT SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO GET THE THREE 
POINTS BUT IN INJURY TIME EMILE 
HESKEY GOT THE EQUALISER FOR WIGAN 
WHO ARE NOW SIX POINTS CLEAR OF 
RELEGATION 
YOU LOOKED VISIBLY SHOCKED WHEN 
WIGAN SCORED IN INJURY TIME NO NO DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO BE SHOCKED WE 
MADE A SUBSTITUTION WITH SHEVCHENKO 
MAYBE SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN BUT 
OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT THE OTHER 
TEAM TO SCORE IN THE LAST MINUTE 
THE FAILURE TO GET THE SECOND GOAL 
HAS COST YOU TONIGHT 
YES AT THE 
END OF THE DAY NOT JUST THE SECOND 
WE COULD HAVE GOT MUCH MORE GOALS 
WE STILL NEED TO PICK UP COUPLE 
OF POINTS WHEN I LOOKED AT THE 
RUN IN WE HAD CHELSEA TOTTENHAM 
COMING UP MAN UNITED COMING UP WE 
ARE NOT SAFE YET SO WE NEEDED A 
BIG POINT AND WHAT BETTER PLACE 
TO COME AND GET IT WE HAVE HAD 
RIDDEN OUR LUCK FOR A LITTLE BIT 
BUT WE SHOWED A LOT OF HONESTY AND 
ENDEAVOUR THE LIVERPOOL CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE RICK PARRY SAYS HE IS 
HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH RAFA BENITEZ 
TO EXPLAIN WHY HE MET JURGEN 
KLINSMANN LAST YEAR BENITEZ IS 
ANGRY THEY MET KLINSMANN TO DISCUSS 
POSSIBLY TAKING OVER AS LIVERPOOL 
MANAGER BENITEZ SAYS HE WANTS THE 
BACKING OF THE BOARD NOW 
THE WELSH RUGBY UNION SAY THEY DO 
NOT WANT WARREN GATLAND TO BE HEAD 
COACH OF THE LIONS HE STEERED 
WALES TO SUCCESS IN THE SIX NATIONS 
HE HAD FEARED HE WOULD BE 
INTERESTED BUT THE WRU SAID THEY 
WOULD LOOK UNFAVOURABLY UPON ANY 
APPROACH FROM THE LIONS COMMITTEE 
HE WOULD BE AN OUTSTANDING 
CANDIDATE FOR THE HEAD COACH OF THE 
LIONS BECAUSE OF HIS EXPERIENCE 
WITH IRELAND WASPS AND WALES HE 
UNDERSTANDS THE CULTURES OF THREE 
OF THE FOUR NATIONS OBVIOUSLY HE 
WOULD BE AN OUTSTANDING CANDIDATE 
HOWEVER OUR FOCUS IS ON WELSH 
RUGBY WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO 
DO AND A LOT OF WORK REMAINS 
MAURICE GREENE HAS DENIED 
ACCUSATIONS THAT HE WAS SUPPLIED 
WITH PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS 
THE AMERICAN NEVER FAILED A DRUGS 
TEST DURING HIS CAREER HE SAYS THE 
ALLEGATIONS MADE IN THE NEW YORK 
TIMES ARE UNTRUE 
AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY FROM THE U. S. A. 
ARE YOU SUPERSTITIOUS FINGERS FINGERS CROSSED DON'T LIKE LOOKING AT 
MAGPIES 
WELL IN SPORT THEY WILL MAGPIES DO ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING THE NEW 
YORK YANKEES SPEND FIVE HOURS 
DRILLING INTO THE FOUNDATIONS OF 
THEIR STADIUM AFTER THEY FOUND OUT 
THE CONSTRUCTION WORKER HAD BURIED 
A RED SOX SHIRT THERE THEY 
HAMMERED THROUGH TO FEET OF 
CONCRETE AND FOUND THE OFFENDING 
JERSEY EVENTUALLY THEY REVEALED 
IT TO THE CAMERA CREWS WHEN WAS IT 
PUT THERE 
IT WAS PUT THERE IN I 
THINK WHEN THEY BUILT THE NEW 
STADIUM 
HAD THEY HAD BAD RESULTS STADIUM FUNNILY ENOUGH THEY LOST TO THE 
RED SOX THIS WEEK BUT THAT WAS AT 
THEIR GROUND 
UNDER EQUIPPED AND POORLY REGARDED 
IT WAS ONCE SEEN AS THE RESERVE 
OF LAST RESORT BUT NOW THE T. A. IS 
CELEBRATING ITS ONE HUNDRED ANNIVERSARY 
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT STORY TODAY 
ITS MEMBERS PROUDLY FIGHTING SIDE 
BY SIDE WITH FULL TIME TROOPS IN 
AFGHANISTAN ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY 
ONE OF THEM JOINS US NOW WHERE 
WERE YOU OUT THERE 
WE SERVED 
PREDOMINANTLY WITHIN THE HELMAND 
PROVINCE BUT BECAUSE OF THE JOB 
THAT WE WERE DOING WE SPENT A LOT 
OF OUR TIME DOING THE INITIAL 
PRELIMINARY RECONNAISSANCE WE WERE 
IN THE DESERT FOR THE BEST PART OF 
THREE MONTHS L. WAS THERE THREE 
DAYS AND STRAIGHT INTO OPERATIONS 
THERE WAS NO TIME TO ACCLIMATISE 
WE HAVE GOT PICTURES OF YOU HERE IN 
AFGHANISTAN I ASSUMED IT WOULD BE 
HOT BUT SINCE IT SEEMS NOT SO NO NO IN THE EVENINGS IT CAME TO ABOUT 
SEVENTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS IN THE MORNING 
NOT ABOVE ZERO SO IT'S EXTREMELY 
COLD ESPECIALLY IN THE MOUNTAINOUS 
AREAS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT PEOPLE PEOPLE USED TO THINK OF THE T. A. AS BEING 
WEEKEND WARRIORS PART TIMERS IT'S 
A DIFFERENT STORY NOW ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE T. A. SOLDIERS THESE DAYS 
TAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF RISKS AS 
REGULAR SOLDIERS AND THEREFORE 
THEIR TRAINING SHOULD BE ON A PAR 
AND IT IS ON A PAR WE ARE PREPARED 
TO MOVE THE SAME JOBS 
YOU ACTUALLY 
HAVE ANOTHER JOB DON'T YOU TO 
DO THE SAME JOBS THEY GIVE YOU 
TIME OUT 
YES EMPLOYERS GENERALLY 
WILL HAVE TO GIVE THEIR SOLDIERS 
ARRANGEMENTS TO GO AND SERVE BUT I 
AM SELF EMPLOYED SOLA WAS ABLE TO 
TAKE TWELVE MONTHS OFF 
WHAT MADE YOU 
DECIDE TO JOIN UP 
A NUMBER OF 
REASONS OUTDOOR PURSUITS 
PREDOMINANTLY BUT I'VE ALWAYS 
TAKEN A GREAT INTEREST IN ANYTHING 
MILITARY THIS IS A WAY OF PUTTING 
MY HOBBIES TOGETHER L. THINK PEOPLE 
WORK MUCH HARDER ON THEIR HOBBIES 
THAN THEY DO AT THEIR JOBS YOUR YOUR JOB OBVIOUSLY WERE VERY 
UNDERSTANDING 
YES THEY DID WHAT UNDERSTANDING WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHEN YOU GO BACK 
WELL I DID MANAGE TO USE A 
SATELLITE PHONE OUT THERE TO CHECK 
IN BUT I WILL HAVE TO SPEND SOME 
TIME JUST TO GET BACK INTO WORK TO 
BE ABLE TO SEE PEOPLE AND FIND OUT 
HOW THINGS ARE GOING 
HAVE YOU GOT 
ANOTHER TOUR OR IS THAT IT 
NO I 
THINK IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING 
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO AGAIN 
ESPECIALLY THE ROLE THAT I HAVE 
BEEN DOING IN AFGHANISTAN FOR THE 
LAST ELEVEN MONTHS I LOOK FORWARD TO 
FUTURE OPERATIONS 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH 
NOW WE WOMEN ARE GENTLE AND CALM 
MOSTLY 
WHEREAS WE MEN ARE MACHO MOSTLY AND WE GET HIGH ON MAKING MONEY 
APPARENTLY IF FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS EMPLOYED MORE OF US 
THERE WOULD BE LESS TURMOIL ON THE 
STOCK MARKETS IS THIS REALLY TRUE 
THE MAN WHO CARRIED OUT THAT STUDY 
IS WITH US NOW GOOD MORNING IT IS 
ALL TO DO WITH TESTOSTERONE IS IT 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IT IS ALL TO 
DO WITH TESTOSTERONE 
EXPLAIN TO 
ME 
WELL WE WERE TESTING A LARGER ME HYPOTHESIS AND THAT IS THAT THE 
STEROIDS THAT ARE PRODUCED 
NATURALLY BY YOUR BODY ARE 
CONTRIBUTING TO FINANCIAL MARKET 
INSTABILITY IN A FINANCIAL MARKET 
BUBBLE TESTOSTERONE LEVELS BUILD 
UP IN TRADERS SO THAT IT STARTS TO 
AFFECT THEIR JUDGMENTS AND THEY 
START TO TAKE STUPID RISKS ON THE 
DOWNSIDE DURING A CRASH A STRESS 
HORMONE NAMED CORTISOL BUILDS UP IN 
THEIR BODIES WHICH CAUSES THEM TO 
BE IRRATIONALLY RISK AVERSE WE 
THINK THESE TWO STEROIDS ARE 
EXAGGERATING BOTH FINANCIAL MARKET 
BUBBLES AND FINANCIAL MARKET 
CRASHES THAT IS A VERY BIG 
HYPOTHESIS WE DID NOT HAVE TIME 
THAT IS A THREE YEAR PROJECT THE 
EXPERIMENT WE HAVE JUST FINISHED 
WE WERE JUST COLLECTING PRELIMINARY 
DATA TO SEE IF WE WERE ON THE RIGHT 
TRACK 
BUT WE 
WOULD BE BETTER OFF TRACK WOULD WE IF THERE WERE MORE WOMEN 
AND OLDER MEN ON THE TRADING 
FLOORS 
IT IS POSSIBLE A THINK FLOORS WHAT YOU WANT FOR FINANCIAL 
STABILITY IS A GREATER ENDOCRINE 
PROFILE THAT MEANS THE HORMONE 
PROFILE WOMEN HAVE A COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT PROFILE AND ALSO MORE 
OLDER MEN 
IF YOU ARE SAYING THAT 
THE MEN WITH HIGHER TESTOSTERONE 
MAKE MORE MONEY AND YOU CAN SORT 
OF SEE WHY THEY ARE EMPLOYED IN THE 
CITY 
RIGHT BUT THE TYPE OF CITY TRADING WE WERE LOOKING AT WAS A 
VERY SPECIFIC TYPE OF TRADING AND 
THE RANGERS OF TESTOSTERONE WERE 
VERY NARROW IT IS TRUE THAT IN THE 
MORNING IF THEY HAD HIGHER LEVELS 
OF TESTOSTERONE THEY MORE AID MORE 
MONEY THAT DAY BUT IT IS A VERY 
NARROW KIND OF TRADING THEY MADE 
MORE MONEY IF YOU LOOK OVER LONGER 
PERIODS OF TIME LIGHT YEARS THEN 
THOSE EFFECTS ARE A LOT WEAKER THE THE IT SOUNDS ALMOST AS IF MEN OF A 
CERTAIN AGE BECOME IRRATIONAL 
CHEMICALLY IRRATIONAL IF YOU LIKE 
DURING TIMES OF CRISIS 
YEAH IT'S 
POSSIBLE 
GOSH THANK YOU VERY MUCH POSSIBLE AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK WE WILL BE ASKING 
A FORMER THE APPRENTICE CONTESTANT 
WHETHER THEY AGREE WITH THAT 
RESEARCH WHETHER SHE AGREES WITH 
THAT RESEARCH THE MAIN STORIES 
GORDON BROWN IS MEETING THE BOSSES 
OF SOME BIG BANKS TODAY AMID 
DEEPENING GLOOM ABOUT THE HOUSING 
MARKET THE SURVIVORS OF A BUS 
CRASH IN ECUADOR IN WHICH FIVE 
STUDENTS WERE KILLED ARE EXPECTED 
TO HEAD HOME TO BRITAIN TODAY ALSO 
COMING UP WHY THE GOOD PEOPLE OF 
STROUD ARE NOT BOWLED OVER ABOUT 
HELPING OUT ON THE GREEN WHEN THEY 
FIRST LAID THIS GREEN QUEEN 
ELIZABETH WAS STILL LOCKED UP IN 
THE TOWER OF LONDON BUT THIS 
BOWLING CLUB IS STRUGGLING BECAUSE 
THEY SAY A LOT OF OLDER PEOPLE DO 
NOT WANT TO VOLUNTEER ANY MORE 
THEY DO NOT WANT TO COMMIT TWO 
THINGS TO NOW THE WEATHER 
IT IS A FROSTY START THIS MORNING 
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AROUND BUT 
TEMPERATURES IN A COUPLE OF AREAS 
HAVE FALLEN IT WILL TAKE A WHILE 
FOR THEM TO RECOVER IN THE NORTH 
WE HAVE CLOUD RAIN AND THE 
HEADLINE IS FOR FURTHER SUNSHINE 
AND SHOWERS SOME AREAS WILL STAY 
DRY DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS THIS IS 
A SYSTEM DRIFTING THROUGH SCOTLAND 
THAT IS PRODUCING PERSISTENT RAIN 
BUT AS IT MOVES SOUTH IT WILL 
FRAGMENT AND BECOME A SHOWERY SO 
BY NINE AM IT SHOULD HAVE CLEARED FROM 
SCOTLAND AND BRIGHTNESS WILL COME 
THROUGH HE WILL BRING SLEET AND 
SNOW TO HIGHER GROUND EAST ANGLIA 
THE SOUTH EAST CORNER A CHILLY 
START BUT A SUNNY ONE EVENTUALLY 
THOSE TEMPERATURES WILL RECOVER 
THE SAME FOR MUCH OF THE SOUTH 
COAST INTO THE SOUTH WEST YOU CAN 
SEE A COUPLE OF SHOWERS PUSHING 
INTO WALES AND THE CARDIGAN BAY 
AREA NOTHING TOO SIGNIFICANT BUT 
IT WILL BRING MORE IN THE WAY OF 
CLOUD AND BITS AND PIECES OF 
SHOWERS HE NORTHERN IRELAND 
SHOWERS BUT IT WILL CLEAR THREW 
OUT THE DAY I THINK THE EXTREME 
SOUTH EASTERN CORNER THROUGHOUT 
THE DAY WILL STAY BRIGHT DURING 
DAYLIGHT HOURS MORE CLOUD AND 
SHOWERS INTO THE MIDLANDS BRIGHTER 
TO SCOTLAND AND WILL THEN IRELAND 
OVERNIGHT THOUGH SHOWERS WILL TEND 
TO LINGER IN THE SOUTH EASTERN 
CORNER SO NOT AS MUCH FROST AROUND 
HERE L. THINK FOR TOMORROW MORNING 
THE SHOWERS WILL LINGER ALONG 
LINCOLNSHIRE THE SOUTH EAST FOR A 
TIME THE BEST BREAKS AND BRIGHTER 
SPELLS WILL BE TO THE SOUTH AND 
WEST ENJOY IT IT WILL STOP TO 
FEEL FRESHER WHEN THE WINDS PICK UP 
FROM THURSDAY ONWARDS 
AND LOOKING AT THE PAPERS THIS 
MORNING WHILE GORDON BROWN IS 
HAVING A MEETING IN DOWNING STREET 
NOT GOOD NEWS IN THE TIMES HIS 
TRADE MINISTER HAS TOLD MINISTERS 
HE WILL RESIGN BEFORE THE NEXT 
ELECTION BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT 
TO SUPPORT THE PRIME MINISTER 
PUBLICLY DURING A CAMPAIGN 
THE DAILY EXPRESS TO TALK ABOUT 
PRICES SOARING AT THE FASTEST RATE 
FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AN ALMOST EXACT 
HEADLINE IN ON THE FRONT OF THE 
DAILY MAIL 
THE GUARDIAN SAYS HOUSE PRICES ARE 
FALLING AT THE FASTEST RATE J. K. 
ROWLING LOOKS AS THOUGH SHE IS IN 
HANDCUFFS HANDCUFFS IT IS A VERY NICE HANDBAG 
SHE IS GOING INTO COURT IN NEW YORK 
TO DEFEND HER WORK AGAIN SOMEBODY 
WHO WANTS TO DO WRITE AN 
ENCYCLOPAEDIA ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND THE DAILY MIRROR HAS PRINTED 
THE LAST E. MAIL SENT FROM INDIRA 
SWANN TO HER PARENTS IN ECUADOR 
SHE SAYS THANKS FOR GIVING ME THE 
CHANCE TO DO THIS AND FOR GIVING ME 
SUCH UNLOVELY HOME SO NOTHING COULD 
STOP ME WANTING TO COME BACK 
SHE WAS KILLED IN ECUADOR 
THE TELEGRAPH SAYS PROSTRATE CANCER 
COULD BE HALTED BY COMBINING TWO 
DRUGS USED TO TREAT CHOLESTEROL AND 
ARTHRITIS ARTHRITIS AND THE STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF 
THE SUN THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS 
ROYAL MARINE WHO SERVED WITH PRINCE 
HARRY IN AFGHANISTAN HAS BEEN 
TREATED IN AN N. H. S. HOSPITAL AND NOW 
HAS MRSA 
JUST LOOKING INSIDE THE PAPERS 
POOR JACK FIRST CRASH IN SEVENTY SIX YEARS 
OF DRIVING AND IT WAS RATHER 
SPECTACULAR BUT HE DID HIT TWO 
PORSCHES THIS IS HOW HE DID IT HE 
WAS REVERSING HIS CAR AND SOMEHOW 
SOMETHING WENT WRONG IT WAS ONLY A 
FORD FIESTA IT FLIPPED OVER 
CAUSED SIXTY THOUSAND WORTH OF DAMAGE HE 
HAS BEEN DRIVING FOR SEVENTY SIX YEARS 
HALF A MILLION MILES AND NEVER 
EVEN HAD A PARKING TICKET HE IS 
GIVING UP 
AND AFTER THEY HAD FINISHED TAKING 
THE PHOTOGRAPH HE SAID DO YOU 
WANT ME TO SWEEP UP 
VERY SAD 
AS YOU MENTION MR. GORDON BROWN 
MEETING WITH THE BOSSES OF 
BRITAIN'S RETAIL AND INVESTMENT 
BANKS LATER THIS MORNING NO 
SURPRISES THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION 
SOLUTIONS TO THIS CREDIT CRISIS 
MESS IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER 
THIS MEETING COMING DAYS AFTER 
ALASTAIR DARLING HAD URGED THE 
BANKS TO PASS ON THE INTEREST RATE 
CUT SO HOW MUCH SWAY WILL HE HAVE 
WITH THE BANKS IS THERE A SOLUTION 
TO THIS MESS SEE IF WE CAN GET 
SOME ANSWERS CATHERINE WELCOME TO 
BREAKFAST IT DOES SEEM RECENTLY 
THE BIG BANKS HAVE BEEN PULLING ALL 
THE STRINGS HOW MUCH POWER DOES THE CITY HAVE 
THE CITY HAS A LOT 
OF POWER ON THE INTEREST RATES 
ISSUE THE BANKS DON'T HAVE TO 
LEAVE THE PASS ON THOSE INTEREST 
RATE CUTS OBVIOUSLY IT IS A GOOD 
P. R. EXERCISE IF THEY CAN GIVE 
HOMEOWNERS A REPRIEVE BUT IF IT IS 
NOT RIGHT COMMERCIALLY AND WITH 
CREDIT BEING SO SCARCE AND THE 
BANKS NOT LENDING TO EACH OF THE 
COMET MIGHT MAKE SENSE NOT TO PASS 
IT ON 
LET'S TALK ABOUT GORDON 
BROWN'S POWERS ARE OTHER MEASURES 
HE CAN PUT IN PLACE TO ENCOURAGE 
THESE BANKS TO PASS ON A LOWER 
INTEREST RATES 
THE GOVERNMENT CAN 
LEGISLATE BUT THAT IS THE LAST 
THING ANYONE WILL WANT THE 
GOVERNMENT AND THE BANKS WERE 
LIKELY COME TO AN AGREEMENT I WILL 
SCRATCH YOUR BACK IF YOU SCRATCH 
MEIN IF THE BANK OF READING AND 
FREES UP THE MONEY MARKETS THEY 
MAY SAY TO THE BANKS WHAT ARE YOU 
GOING TO DO 
PERHAPS IF THE BANKS 
IGNORE GORDON BROWN WHAT HAPPENED 
NEXT 
IT IS A GOOD QUESTION L. NEXT WOULD SAY THEY ARE NOT GOING TO 
IGNORE HIM THEY WANT A SOLUTION TO 
THIS CRISIS AS MUCH AS GORDON BROWN 
DOES IT IS AFFECTING THEIR 
OPERATIONS IF GORDON BROWN CAN 
GIVE THEM A DEAL THEY CAN WORK WITH 
AND SURE THEY WILL OBLIGE BY 
HELPING HIM OUT 
DO YOU THINK WE 
COULD SEE IN THIS MEETING THE 
GOVERNMENT ASKING THE BANKS TO COME 
CLEAN TO REVEAL ALL OF THEIR DEBT 
GORDON BROWN HAS COME OUT AT THE 
WEEKEND AND SAID HE WANTS THE BANKS 
TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT THERE IS A 
CONNECTION WITH THE BANKS BEING 
TRANSPARENT AND THE RATE AT WHICH 
THEY LEND TO EACH OF THE DROPPING 
THAT INCREASES WHEN THERE IS 
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY ARE 
EXPOSED TO CREDIT CRUNCH ISSUES 
UNCERTAINTY MEANS THE KEY WORD 
THAT IS IT FROM ME NOW BUT WE WILL 
BE BACK IN THE NEXT HOUR WITH ALL 
THOSE RESULTS COMING IN FROM THE 
HIGH STREET 
WON THE SPANISH ARMADA WAS SIGHTED 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT SIR FRANCIS DRAKE WAS SAID 
TO BE PLAYING BOWLS AT THE TIME IT 
IS SAID HE INSISTED ON FINISHING 
HIS GAME 
HE WON'T BE PLEASED THAT HAYGREEN 
GOING BACK TO HIS TIME IS IN 
TROUBLE PEOPLE ARE NOT BOWLED OVER 
WITH HELPING TO RUN THE PLACE IN 
STROUD RICHARD IS THERE 
IT IS CLOSED THIS MORNING BECAUSE 
THERE IS A FROST YOU MENTIONED THE 
SPANISH ARMADA WHEN THEY FIRST PUT 
THIS GRASS DOWN THAT WAS THIRTY YEARS 
BEFORE THE SPANISH ARMADA CAME 
KNOCKING THERE WAS ALSO A PIT 
WHERE YOU COULD WATCH COCK FIGHTING 
NOW THIS CLUB IS STRUGGLING BECAUSE 
THEY SAY OLDER PEOPLE TEND NOT TO 
WANT TO VOLUNTEER ANY MORE AND THEY 
ARE STRUGGLING FOR MEMBERS AND FOR 
PEOPLE TO HELP OUT APPARENTLY IT 
IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM 
THE FIRST TIME THEY BOWLED ON THE 
SCREEN QUEEN ELIZABETH WAS STILL 
LOCKED UP IN THE TOWER OF LONDON 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS LATER THE FALCON BOWLING 
CLUB IS UNDER THREAT BECAUSE NO ONE 
WANTS TO VOLUNTEER ANY MORE 
THAT IS NOT BAD 
IT IS GOING TOO 
FAST 
WHY DO YOU THINK LESS PEOPLE FAST ARE WILLING TO COMMIT TO A SPORT 
LIKE THIS NOWADAYS DIFFICULT DIFFICULT QUESTION IN A CLUBS SUCH AS OURS 
YOU DON'T NEED PEOPLE JUST TO PLAY 
BOWLS YOU NEED PEOPLE TO HAVE A 
BIT OF COMMITMENT TO HELP AND WORK 
ON THE GREEN TO HELP AND WORK ON 
THE CLUBHOUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE 
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE 
SO IT MEANS 
THE FUTURE OF ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S 
OLDEST GREENS IS DOWN TO THE SAME 
PEOPLE PUTTING IN THEIR FREE TIME 
YEAR AFTER YEAR 
WE USED TO HAVE A 
MEMBERSHIP OF NINETY IF YOU YEARS AGO 
NOW IT IS JUST OVER SIXTY IT IS 
GETTING SMALLER IT WILL BE SAD IF 
A CLUB THAT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR WAS TO CLOSE DOWN 
THEY ARE 
NOT ALONE IT IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM 
MANY SMALLER VILLAGE CLUBS 
STRUGGLE FOR MEMBERS BECAUSE PEOPLE 
DON'T WANT TO COMMIT 
I LOVE IT 
HERE I CALL THIS GOD'S LITTLE ACRE 
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN JOINING 
THEY WILL LET ANYONE HAVE A GO 
CAN I TELL YOU YOUR ACTION WAS 
THAT OF A LEFT HANDED BOWLER THIS THIS IS ME FIVE MINUTES LATER IF YOU 
BELIEVE I BOWL THAT YOU BELIEVE 
ANYTHING YOU ARE THE SECRETARY 
HERE COULD THE CLUB CLOSED 
IT IS 
A NATIONAL PROBLEM BUT WE HAVE 
PARTICULAR DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE OF 
THE CATCHMENT AREA WHICH WE DRAW ON 
WHICH IS ALSO SURROUNDED BY STROUD 
GLOUCESTER AND CHELTENHAM WHO HAVE 
THEIR OWN CLUBS IT IS A SERIOUS 
PROBLEM IN THE SENSE WE HAVE THE 
PROBLEM OF SUSTAINABILITY TO USE A 
MODERN ADJECTIVE OUR MEMBERSHIP IS 
OLD AND WE ARE NOT GETTING NEW 
MEMBERS IN AND CLEARLY HONORARY 
POSTS ARE BECOMING DIFFICULT TO 
FILL 
HE WILL BE TALKING TO YOU FILL LATER IN THE MORNING BUT I HAVE 
THIS FACT BOWLING WAS ILLEGAL 
UNTIL ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY BECAUSE HENRY THE EIGHTH WAS 
THE FIRST TO BAN IT BECAUSE HE 
WANTED ALL THE PEOPLE TO DO ARCHERY 
INSTEAD SO THEY WERE GOOD AT 
FIGHTING FIGHTING SO SIR FRANCIS DRAKE WAS BREAKING 
THE LAW 
MUCH MORE TO COME ON BREAKFAST 
I HAD A BAD PUPIL THIS MORNING

SLAMMED THE DOOR ON ME

INSTRUMENTS FROM CAR PARTS A 
FLUKE

OUR MAIN STORY GORDON BROWN IS 
MAKING BANKING CHIEFS LATER AMID 
CONCERN OVER THE ECONOMY 
DOWNING STREET IS INSISTING THIS IS 
ABSOLUTELY NOT A CRISIS MEETING IT 
IS THE KIND OF GET TOGETHER GORDON 
BROWN HOUSE WITH PEOPLE FROM THE 
CITY ALL THE TIME THIS WEEK HE IS 
OFF TO AMERICA TO SPEAK TO BANKERS 
ON WALL STREET CITY BUT IT 
COMES AT TIME OF GLOOM IN THE 
HOUSING MARKET AND ON THE HIGH 
STREET NOT LONG AGO THE HOUSING 
MARKET WAS BOOMING AND PEOPLE WERE 
SPENDING LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW 
BUT NOW THE PROPERTY MARKET HAS 
STARTED TO TURN CONSUMERS ARE 
TIGHTENING THEIR BELTS FROM YOUR 
STREET TO THE HIGH STREET THE 
ECONOMY IS SLOWING DOWN AT FAULT 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH WHICH HAS SEEN 
LENDERS PUSH UP MORTGAGE RATES A 
NEW SURVEY TODAY CLAIMS IT HAS LEFT 
ESTATE AGENTS AT THEIR MOST GLOOMY 
FOR YEARS THAT'S NO SURPRISE TO 
BRENDAN WHO BORROWED HEAVILY TO 
REVAMP HIS BELFAST HOME AND NOW 
IT HAS FALLEN IN VALUE AND HE IS 
IN ARREARS WITH HIS MORTGAGE WE WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE MILL HERE 
TRYING TO SELL THIS HOUSE WE HAVE 
GOT PEOPLE WANTING TO BUY THE HOUSE 
THEY CANNOT SELL THEIR OWN HOUSE 
IT IS A COMPLETE KNOCK ON CHAIN 
EFFECT 
IT'S DIFFICULT TIMES FOR EFFECT RETAILERS TOO WITH MANY SAYING 
THAT PROFITS ARE UNDER THREAT 
FIGURES SHOW THAT IN MARCH RETAIL 
SALES FELL BY SIXTEEN PER CENT IF THAT'S THE 
BIGGEST FALL IN ALMOST THREE YEARS 
SOME BLAME THE EARLY EASTER OTHERS 
THE POOR WEATHER THAT'S THE 
BIGGEST FALL IT IS EVIDENCE OF AN 
ECONOMY THAT IS UNDER STRAIN 
NOBODY KNOWS HOW LONG IT WILL LAST 
OR HOW TOUGH IT WILL BE BUT THE 
SLOWDOWN IS STARTING TO BITE MORE 
NEWS FOR GORDON BROWN THIS MORNING 
AND IT IS BAD NEWS AGAIN HIS TRADE 
MINISTER LORD DIGBY JONES WAS 
BROUGHT IN AS AN OUTSIDER BUT IT 
HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT HE WILL NOT 
CARRY ON IN THE JOB BEYOND THE NEXT 
ELECTION IT EMERGES THAT HE SPOKE 
TO A PRIVATE BUSINESS MEETING WHERE 
HE SAID THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO BE 
ASKED BY THE MEDIA WHETHER OR NOT 
HE ACTUALLY SUPPORTED GORDON BROWN 
THAT IS WHY HE IS LEAVING THE POST 
NOT GOOD NEWS FOR GORDON BROWN 
IN A FEW MINUTES WE WILL BE 
FINDING OUT WHETHER THAT CREDIT 
CRUNCH HAS HIT TESCO AND DEBENHAM'S 
TWELVE BRITISH STUDENTS WHO SURVIVED A 
BUS CRASH IN ECUADOR ARE EXPECTED 
TO START THEIR JOURNEY HOME TODAY 
FIVE WOMEN DIED WHEN THE COACH THEY 
WERE TRAVELLING IN COLLIDED WITH A 
LORRY THE SURVIVORS HAVE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT THEIR ORDEAL 
EIGHTY OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED THE CRASH 
GATHER IN A ROOM HERE IN THE 
CAPITAL QUITO YOU CAN SEE WHAT 
THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH DESPITE 
EVERYTHING EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SARAH SAYS 
GAP YEARS ARE A GREAT EXPERIENCE I I THINK A YEAR OUT HAS A HUGE AMOUNT 
OF BENEFITS L. THINK A TRAGIC 
ACCIDENT SHOULDN'T BE STOPPING 
PEOPLE FROM ROM TRAVELLING THE THE OTHER FOUR SURVIVORS ARE BEING 
TREATED AT THIS HOSPITAL THEIR 
INJURIES ARE NOT SERIOUS AND THE 
GROUP HAVE FOUND SOLACE BY STICKING 
TOGETHER AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE 
NINE OF THE TOURISTS IN THEIR HOTEL 
HERE AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY 
THANK YOU TO THE GOVERNMENT OF 
ECUADOR WHO ARE LOOKING AFTER THEM 
HERE IN THE HOTEL WE HAVE GOT FOUR 
PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL HERE NONE 
OF THEM HAVE LIFE THREATENING 
INJURIES BUT THEY ARE BEING 
TREATED FOR MINOR INJURIES WE WANT 
TO TALK TO THEM NOW ABOUT WHEN WE 
CAN GET THEM OUT OF THE HOSPITAL 
THE BODIES OF THE FOUR TEENAGERS 
AND THE TOUR GUIDE ARE NOW BEING 
FLOWN BACK TO QUITO THE TWELVE 
STUDENTS SHOULD BE RETURNING TO THE 
U. K. TODAY INVESTIGATORS SAY THE 
LORRY THAT HIT THE TOUR BUS HAS 
BEEN RECOVERED BUT THE DRIVER IS 
STILL MISSING 
AN IRAQI TEENAGER WHO WAS 
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT BY A BRITISH 
SOLDIER IN TWO THOUSAND THREE IS TO RECEIVE TWO 
MILLION IN COMPENSATION THE BOY 
FROM BASRA SUFFERED SEVERE SPINAL 
INJURIES LEAVING HIM PARALYSED 
WHEN A SOLDIER DROPPED HIS GUN 
MAKING THE WEAPON GO OFF THE 
COMPENSATION IS HIGHER THAN ANY 
PAYMENT MADE TO BRITISH TROOPS 
INJURED IN IRAQ SILVIO BERLUSCONI 
HAS WON A THIRD TERM AS ITALY'S 
PRIME MINISTER THE SEVENTY ONE YEAR OLD 
WARNED OF DIFFICULT MONTHS AHEAD 
AS HE PROMISED URGENT ACTION TO 
TACKLE THERE WAS ANY ECONOMY HIS 
IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES ARE THE SALE 
OF THE LOSS MAKING AIRLINE ALITALIA 
AND THE CRISIS CAUSED BY 
UNCOLLECTED WASTED IN NAPLES A 
POST MORTEM IS TO BE CARRIED OUT 
TODAY ON THE BODY OF THE T. V. A 
PRESENTER MARK SPEIGHT WHICH WAS 
FOUND AT A LONDON TRAIN STATION 
HIS FRIENDS SAY HE HAD BEEN IN A 
VULNERABLE STATE AFTER THE DEATH OF 
HIS FIANCEE FROM TODAY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF 
PETROL AND DIESEL MUST BE MADE FROM 
BIO FUEL IT IS PART OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE 
CARBON EMISSIONS ENVIRONMENTALISTS 
ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER THE MOVE 
WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT 
CARS FUELLED BY CROPS THE OILSEED 
RAPE IN THIS FIELD IN COUNTY DURHAM 
WILL BE USED TO MAKE BIO DIESEL 
JUST ESTABLISHING ITSELF IN THE 
FIELD NEXT DOOR IS WHEAT TO 
PRODUCE PETROL SUBSTITUTE FROM 
TODAY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE FEW WILL BE BY 
MUST BY LAW BE BIO FUEL THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS SET ITS BIO FUEL 
TARGETS AND THERE WAS CONSENSUS A 
FEW YEARS AGO THAT THIS WAS A GOOD 
AND GREEN SOLUTION BUT NOW SOME 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THAT IS NOT 
TRUE 
WHEN YOU GO AND FILL UP YOUR TRUE CAR THERE MAY BE PALM OIL GOING 
INTO YOUR TANK THAT WAS GROWN 
SOMEWHERE THAT WAS A TROPICAL 
RAINFOREST TWO YEARS AGO THERE IS 
NOTHING THAT GOVERNMENT HAS DONE TO 
STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING SO THE 
BIO FUELS WE HAVE GOT AT THE MOMENT 
THEY ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE 
MAKE NO 
MISTAKE BIO FUELS ARE BIG BUSINESS 
THIS SITE IS SET TO BECOME A HUGE 
BIO ETHANOL PLANT 
BIO FUEL FROM 
THIS PLANT IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN WILL BE THE 
EQUIVALENT OF TAKING ABOUT THREE HUNDRED COWS 
AND CARS OFF THE U. K. ROADS 
EVEN SO 
THERE ARE SIGNS THAT CONCERNS ABOUT 
BIO DIESEL ARE SPREADING CARS 
TODAY THE PRIME MINISTER IS 
EXPECTED TO CALL FOR AN URGENT 
REVIEW ABOUT HOW BIO FUEL 
PRODUCTION PLAYS INTO THE DOABLE 
FLEW ALL SCOTTISH INTO THE 
GLOBAL FOOD SHORTAGE J. K. ROWLING IS 
TRYING TO STOP THE PUBLICATION OF 
AN UNOFFICIAL HARRY POTTER 
ENCYCLOPAEDIA THE WRITER OF THE 
ENCYCLOPEDIA SAYS HE IS LEGALLY 
ENTITLED TO CREATE A REFERENCE 
GUIDE TO J. K. ROWLING'S WORK THE 
WORLD'S STOCK MARKETS COULD BE LESS 
TURBULENT IF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
ARE EMPLOYED MORE WOMEN AND OLDER 
MEN ACCORDING TO A STUDY FROM 
CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY THEY FOUND 
THERE WAS A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THE 
AMOUNT OF MONEY TRADERS MADE AND 
THEIR LEVELS OF THE HORMONE 
TESTOSTERONE 
IT'S A HIGH PRESSURE WORLD BUT 
WHAT IS IT THAT MARKS OUT THE 
WINNERS FROM THE LOSERS FINANCIAL 
TRADING FLOORS HELP TO DEFINE THE 
HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY BUT ARE 
THOSE CRUCIAL DEALS BASED ON 
RATIONAL JUDGMENT GUT INSTINCT OR 
SIMPLY MALE HORMONE LEVELS IT 
TURNS OUT THAT LEVELS OF 
TESTOSTERONE CAN MAKE A BIG 
DIFFERENCE 
HERE ARE THE AVERAGE PROFITS OF TEN 
EXPERT TRADERS ON DAYS WHEN THEIR 
TESTOSTERONE LEVELS WERE LOW AND 
THIS IS HOW THEY DID ON HIGH TEST 
AROUND DAYS BUT THE MAN WHO DID 
THE RESEARCH THINKS HIGH 
TESTOSTERONE DAYS THAT 
TESTOSTERONE CAN LEAD TO TRADERS 
TAKING EVER HIGHER RISKS 
IT SEEMS THAT EXTREME LEVELS OF 
TESTOSTERONE ARE CAUSING STOCK 
MARKET 
MARKET BUBBLES TO BECOME 
EXAGGERATED ONE WAY OF DEALING 
WITH THIS IS TO DIVERSIFY FOUR MILE 
PROFILES ON THE TRADING FLOOR AND 
THAT WOULD MEAN HIRING MORE WOMEN 
AND MORE OLDER MEN DIVERSIFY 
HORMONE PROFILES 
A SIGN OF HOW THE ECONOMY MAY BE 
GETTING ON HIS FIGURES FROM TESCO 
OUT THIS MORNING ARAN HAS GOT THEM

WHAT DID HE DO 
HE WAS LATE 
REFUSED TO PAY HIS MONEY HE SWORE 
AND SLAMMED THE DOOR 
THIS DRIVING INSTRUCTOR PLAYED BY 
EDDIE MARSAN WILL BE HERE 
I WILL BE SHOWING YOU WHY THIS IS 
THE WORST ENEMY OF THE GREY 
SQUIRREL 
WE WILL HAVE THE WEATHER IN A 
MOMENT BUT WE WANT TO SHOW YOU 
SOMETHING LOVELY THAT IS THE 
BOWLING GREEN THAT RICHARD HAS BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT 
ENGLAND AND WALES NOT STARTING OFF 
TOO BADLY BUT WE WILL SEE SHOWERS 
TODAY AND THERE IS RAIN AROUND AT 
THE MOMENT THROUGH SOUTHERN 
SCOTLAND IT IS THE SAME ARE OLD 
SAME OLD IN TERMS OF THE HEADLINE 
I DID TRY TO THINK OF SOMETHING 
DIFFERENT ANOTHER DAY OF SUNSHINE 
AND SHOWERS ONE OR TWO PLACES 
MIGHT ESCAPE THEM ALL TOGETHER 
DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS ANYWAY THIS 
ORGANISED BAND OF RAIN WILL 
FRAGMENT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
HOURS WE ALSO SEE CLEARER SKIES TO 
THE SOUTH IT IS AN IMPROVEMENT TO 
THE NORTH AND WEST WITH BREAKS IN 
THE CLOUD MAYBE SLEET TO HIGHER 
GROUND ACROSS THE PENNINES FOR 
STUMBLING INJURED EAST ANGLIA THE 
SOUTH EAST CORNER GLORIOUS START 
THE BITCHILY TEMPERATURES HAVE 
FALLEN IN A COUPLE OF PLACES THE 
BIT CHILLY A FEW SHOWERS INTO THE 
CARDIGAN BAY AND THE NORTH WEST OF 
WALES THE SAME FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND THE ISLE OF MAN BUT 
THE SHOWERS WILL EASE IN THE 
AFTERNOON FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AS 
THE DAY PROGRESSES THAT BAND OF 
RAIN WILL DRIFT SLOWLY SOUTHWARDS 
PERHAPS INTO CENTRAL WALES AND THE 
MIDLANDS BUT EAST ANGLIA THE 
SOUTH EAST CORNER AND THE SOUTH 
COAST MAY STAY DRY TED BRIDGES 
BETWEEN EIGHT AND THIRTEEN DEGREES THE 
SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TONIGHT 
POCKETS OF FROST A BIT OF ICE AND 
PATCHY MIST AND FOG TEMPERATURES 
FALLING TOMORROW MORNING IT WILL 
START WITH THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE 
AND THE NORTH NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
SHELTERED SOUTH AND WEST ONE OR 
TWO SHOWERS CLINGING ON TO 
LINCOLNSHIRE THEY MAY LINGER 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY BE SIMILAR 
FIELD THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
THEY MIGHT LOOK CUTE AND CUDDLY 
BUT IN NORTHUMBERLAND THEY ARE IN 
THE LINE OF FIRE 
THOUSANDS OF GREY SQUIRRELS HAVE 
BEEN CULLED WHY HAVE THEY BECOME 
THE BADDIES 
GOOD MORNING NORTHUMBERLAND IS 
KNOWN AS THE BORDER COUNTRY BUT IT 
IS AN ACTIVE WILDLIFE BATTLE GROUND 
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN SEE 
RED SQUIRRELS BUT THEY DON'T LIKE 
GREY SQUIRRELS THEY ARE TRAPPING 
THEM AND CULLING THEM THEY ARE 
ENTICING THEM INTO CAGES LIKE THIS 
ONCE THEY ARE IN THEY ARE TRAPPED 
THEY ARE TAKEN AWAY AND THEN 
DISPATCHED DISPATCHED PAUL PARKER DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS A 
CONSERVATIONIST BUT HE CONSERVES 
BY KILLING HIS PREY IS SMALL AND 
ENDEMIC ACROSS THE COUNTRY MR. 
PARKER KILLS SQUIRRELS FOR LIVING 
GREY SQUIRRELS LIKE THIS ONE WE WE ARE TAKING THIS ANIMAL AWAY TODAY 
BECAUSE THEY ARE CARRYING SQUIRREL 
POX WHICH KILLS THE RED SQUIRREL 
AS SOON AS THEY PICK IT UP THE RED 
SQUIRREL IS DEAD WITHIN THREE WEEKS 
THEY GET INTO NEST BOXES AND THEY 
EAT EGGS 
IN LITTLE OVER A YEAR 
THIS GOVERNMENT SPONSORED TRAPPER 
HAS CAUGHT AROUND SEVEN THOUSAND NGORONGORO 
CRATER SQUIRRELS ACROSS 
NORTHUMBRIA IT IS ESTIMATED FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN LITTLE OVER A 
YEAR THE REASON IS TO SAVE THE 
NATIVE RED IT'S NUMBERS ARE TINY 
IN COMPARISON TO THE GREY SQUIRREL 
THEY HAVE COLONISED AND DOMINATED 
AND EVERYONE RECOGNISES THE 
IMPORTANCE OF CONTROLLING THE 
SPREAD BUT SOME BELIEVE MASS 
CULLING 
IS 
THE WRONG SOLUTION IT IT IS DUBIOUS KILLING ONE SPECIES FOR THE SAKE OF ANOTHER THEN THE EARLY 
SEVENTIES YOU COULD GET A LICENCE TO KILL 
A RED SQUIRREL NOW IT IS THE GREY 
SQUIRRELS AGAINST THE BACKGROUND 
OF TAMPERING AND DRIVING ANIMALS TO 
THE POINT OF EXTINCTION AND THEN 
TURNING ROUND AND KILLING ANIMALS 
DRIVING THEM TO EXTINCTION IS 
DUBIOUS 
IN NORTHUMBRIA THEY INTEND DUBIOUS TO CARRY ON THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE 
CLOSE TO ERADICATING THE BREED FROM 
THE COUNTY WHEN THEY HAVE FINISHED 
HERE THEY WILL HEAD SOUTH IF YOU 
ARE WONDERING WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL 
THE GREY SQUIRRELS THEY ARE BEING 
SOLD AS THE LATEST GAME DELICACY 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE 
FIGURES WHEN WE LOOK AT SQUIRREL 
POPULATIONS RED SQUIRRELS ARE VERY 
RARE ESPECIALLY IN THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF ENGLAND YOU HAVE TO BE 
IN CUMBRIA OR NORTHUMBERLAND TO 
HAVE ANY CHANCE OF SEEING RED 
SQUIRRELS AND THE WILD MOST OF US 
WILL HAVE SEEN GREY SQUIRRELS THEY 
ARE COUNTED IN MILLIONS WHY IS 
THIS SUCH AN IMPORTANT AND PERHAPS 
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE IN 
NORTHUMBERLAND EXPLAIN TO THOSE 
WHO THINK WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU 
DOING CULLING THESE CREATURES WHY 
IS IT SO IMPORTANT 
IF WE STILL 
HAVE THE GREY SQUIRREL IT IS 
LARGER THAN THE RED SQUIRREL ABOUT 
TWICE THE SIZE IF IT IS STILL IN 
NORTHUMBERLAND WITHIN TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY 
YEARS WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE 
RED SQUIRREL THE GREY SQUIRREL OUT 
COMPETES THE RED SQUIRREL IN OR 
PLANTATIONS THE SECOND PROBLEM IS 
IT CARRIES A NASTY DISEASE CALLED 
SQUIRREL POX VIRUS THIS VIRUS THE 
GREY APPEARS TO BE IMMUNE TO WE 
KNOW IT CARRIES IT BECAUSE IT HAS 
BEEN SHOWN IN BLOOD TESTS 
IS IT 
IMPORTANT WE ACTUALLY CULL BECAUSE 
MANY THINK IT IS CRUEL 
IT IS CRUEL 
POTENTIALLY BUT IT IS VERY QUICK 
IF THE RED SQUIRREL CATCHERS THE 
VIRUS IT WILL DIE SLOWLY OVER TWO 
WEEKS 
BACK TO THE STUDIO WEEKS WE SAW THE SQUIRREL IN THE BUTCHER 
HAVE YOU EVER TASTED SQUIRREL WHAT 
IS IT LIKE 
I WAS HOPING YOU WOULDN'T ASK ME 
YES I HAVE TASTED SQUIRREL IT DID 
NOT TASTE OF KNOTS IT WAS SWEET A 
BIT LIKE RABBIT WOULD I HAVE IT 
ALL THE TIME NO I WOULDN'T I'M 
TOLD A LOCAL POSH HOTEL TOOK FORTY THE 
OTHER WEEK SO PERHAPS IT IS A 
GROWING DELICACY 
I AM ABOUT TO READ AN E. MAIL WHAT 
HAVE YOU DONE YOU HAD BETTER SHOW 
PEOPLE WHAT IS THAT 
LATER ON BREAKFAST WE ARE LOOKING

FROM CAR PARTS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN

THE U. K. SPREAD OUT ALL OVER THE

TIME CAPSULE WHICH OUR GREAT 
GRANDCHILDREN COULD PICK UP AS A 
FASCINATING LOOK AT EVERY FACET OF 
EVERYDAY LIFE IF I ASKED YOU TO 
REMEMBER YOUR CHILD'S IF I ASKED

WHOLE LOAD OF MEMORIES

LOOKING UNSETTLED 
WHEN THE SPANISH ARMADA WAS SIGHTED 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT SIR FRANCIS DRAKE WAS SAID 
TO BE PLAYING BOWLS APPARENTLY HE 
FINISHED THE GAME BEFORE HE WENT TO 
SEE SEE HE WOULDN'T BE PLEASED THE GREEN 
GOING BACK TO HIS TIME IS NOW IN 
TROUBLE TROUBLE IT SEEMS PEOPLE ARE NOT BOWLED OVER 
WITH THE IDEA OF HELPING TO RUN THE 
PLACE PLACE RICHARD IS IN PAINSWICK NEAR 
STROUD A BEAUTIFUL SUNRISE 
ARE YOU HAVING A STRESSFUL MORNING 
MAY BE GETTING THE KIDS READY FOR 
SCHOOL GETTING READY FOR WORK 
THIS IS CLOSE TODAY BECAUSE OF THE 
FROST WHEN THIS WAS LAID IT WAS 
THIRTY YEARS BEFORE THE SPANISH ARMADA 
QUEEN ELIZABETH WAS IN THE TOWN OF 
LONDON ONE OF THE OLDEST GREENS IN 
THE COUNTRY THE PEOPLE WHO RUN IT 
SAY THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND 
MEMBERS AND OLDER PEOPLE DO NOT 
WANT TO COMMIT AND VOLUNTEER FREE 
HELP HELP THE FIRST TIME THEY BOWLED ON THE 
SCREEN QUEEN ELIZABETH WAS STILL 
LOCKED UP IN THE TOWER OF LONDON 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS LATE FOR LATER THE 
FALCON BOWLING CLUB IS UNDER THREAT 
BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO VOLUNTEER 
ANY MORE 
THAT IS NOT BAD IT IS 
GOING TOO FAST WOULD YOU BELIEVE 
THAT 
WHY DO YOU THINK LESS PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO COMMIT TO A SPORT 
LIKE THIS NOWADAYS DIFFICULT DIFFICULT QUESTION DIFFICULT QUESTION IN A 
CLUB SUCH AS OURS YOU JUST DON'T 
NEED PEOPLE TO PLAY BOWLS YOU NEED 
PEOPLE TO HAVE A BIT OF COMMITMENTS 
TO HELP AND WORK ON THE GREEN TO 
HELP AND WORK ON THE CLUBHOUSE TOO 
MANY PEOPLE THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE 
IT MEANS THE FUTURE OF ONE OF THE 
COUNTRY'S OLDEST GREENS IS DOWN TO 
THE SAME PEOPLE PUTTING IN THEIR 
FREE TIME YEAR AFTER YEAR WHEREAS WHEREAS WE USED TO HAVE A MEMBERSHIP OF 
ABOUT NINETY NOT MANY YEARS AGO WE 
ARE DOWN TO JUST ABOUT SIXTY ACTUALLY 
IT IS GETTING SMALLER IT WILL BE 
REALLY SAD IF A CLUB THAT WAS IT IN 
EXISTENCE IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR WAS TO CLOSE DOWN 
THEY ARE NOT ALONE BOWLS ENGLAND 
SAYS IT IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM 
SMALLER VILLAGE CLUBS TROUBLING FOR 
MEMBERS BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT 
TO COMMIT 
I LOVE IT HERE I CALL 
THIS GOD'S LITTLE ACRE I WOULDN'T 
WANT TO BE ANYWHERE ELSE ON A 
SUMMER'S DAY 
IF YOU ARE INTEREST 
IN JOINING THEY WERE LET ANYONE 
HAVE A GO 
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU 
WHEN YOU BOWL YOU STEP FORWARD WAS 
THAT OF A LEFT HANDED BOWLER THIS THIS IS ME FIVE MINUTES LATER HONEST 
IF YOU BELIEVE I BOWL THAT YOU 
BELIEVE ANYTHING 
I HAVE ONE FACT THAT UNTIL ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY IT 
WAS ILLEGAL FOR MOST PEOPLE TO PLAY 
BECAUSE HENRY THE EIGHTH AND LAUDED 
BECAUSE HE WANTED THE PEOPLE TO 
PRACTISE ARCHERY BECAUSE IT WAS 
GOOD FOR WALLS THE ONLY CHANGE 
THAT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY 
I AM JEALOUS OF HIM BEING OUT IN 
THE SUNSHINE 
NOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE TESCO 
RESULTS RESULTS PROFIT FOR TESCO IT IS OVER AN ELEVEN 
PER CENT RISE THAT FIGURE COMING IN AT 
JUST OVER TWO EIGHT BILLION GROUP 
SALES COMING IN AT ALMOST FIFTY TWO 
BILLION LIKE FOR LIKE SALES UP 
THAT EXCLUDES FUEL INTERNATIONAL 
SALES UP BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT LET'S TALK TO THE 
MAN HIMSELF SIR TESCO LEAHY 
WELCOME TO BREAKFAST CAN WE START 
WITH PRICES A KEY ISSUE FOR MANY 
PEOPLE OUT THERE TESCO SAYS YOU 
HAVE BEEN SHIELDING YOUR CUSTOMERS 
FROM THESE HIGHER FOOD PRICES BUT 
WE HAVE A LOT OF E. MAILS FROM YOUR 
CUSTOMERS SAYING THE OPPOSITE THEY 
ARE SAYING TESCO IS HIKING UP THESE 
PRICES AND IT IS UNJUSTIFIED 
PRICES ARE RISING ACROSS THE BOARD 
TAKING FOOD AND NON FOOD TOGETHER 
THEY HAVE GONE UP OVER ONE PER CENT IN TESCO 
FOR MANY YEARS PRICES WENT DOWN 
AND IT HAS BEEN GOOD CONTRIBUTION 
TO PEOPLE'S WEEKLY BUDGET BUT THEY 
ARE NOT RISING BY THE AMOUNT SOME 
OF THE HEADLINES WOULD SUGGEST SO 
THERE INCREASES ARE MORE MUTED THAN 
SOME OF THE ALARMING FIGURES 
BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD 
TO KEEP A LID ON PRICES AND THAT IS 
WHAT CUSTOMERS WOULD EXPECT 
ISOLATED PRODUCTS DO GO UP BREAD 
CHICKEN WILL HAVE GONE UP BECAUSE 
OF RISING GRAIN PRICES BUT OTHER 
PRICES HAVE COME DOWN BUT THE 
COMBINED FIGURE IS ABOUT ONE FIVE PER CENT 
WE TALK ABOUT THE TIMES WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT NOW THE SLOWDOWN 
AROUND THE GLOBE WHAT ARE YOUR 
THOUGHTS ON THIS AND DO YOU THINK 
THERE IS MORE PAIN TO COME 
I THINK 
LOOKING AT THE CONSUMER IN THE U. K. 
THEY ARE CONCERNED THEY ARE 
GLOOMIER ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR 
THE YEAR AHEAD SO THE IMPORTANT 
THING FOR ANY BUSINESS IN THAT 
SITUATION IS MAKE SURE THEY 
UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURE THE 
CONSUMER IS UNDER MAKE SURE THEY 
AREN'T RESPOND USEFULLY AND HELP 
THEM OUT WITH BETTER PRODUCTS 
BETTER PRICES AND PROMOTIONS IF 
THEY DO THAT THEY WILL BE REWARDED 
BY THE CONSUMER THERE ARE 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES IN 
THIS MARKET TESCO HAS A GOOD 
REPUTATION FOR OFFERING VALUE IT 
IS A MARKET WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE 
NOT JUST IN THE U. K. BUT AROUND THE 
WORLD WE ARE CONFIDENT CUSTOMERS 
WILL RESPOND VERY POSITIVELY IF 
THEY FEEL THEY ARE GETTING A 
BARGAIN 
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE BARGAIN U. S. OPERATIONS THERE IS A PULL BACK 
ON YOUR EXPANSION PLANS IS THAT AN 
INDICATOR IT IS NOT PERFORMING AS 
WELL AS YOU ORIGINALLY THOUGHT NOT NOT AT ALL THERE IS NO PULLBACK WE 
ARE OPENING AROUND TWO HUNDRED STORES 
AROUND THIS FINANCIAL YEAR WE WERE 
ALWAYS GOING TO PAUSE FOR A FEW 
WEEKS AFTER HAVING ACHIEVED SO MUCH 
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THE 
OPENING HAS BEEN TREMENDOUSLY WELL 
RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS L. HAVE NEVER 
SEEN MORE POSITIVE RESEARCH THEY 
LIKED THE STRONG PRICES AND HIGH 
QUALITY NEIGHBOUR OF SHOPPING THEY 
DO SEE IT AS SOMETHING NEW AND 
DIFFERENT IN THE MARKET THE APPEAL 
IS ACROSS ALL INCOME GROUPS AND AGE 
GROUPS ACROSS THE MARKET L. AM 
PLEASED WHEN WE HAVE GOT TO IN A 
SHORT SPACE OF TIME 
TALK TO ME 
ABOUT YOUR HOPES WITH THIS DIGITAL 
DOWNLOAD SERVICE TESCO IS 
OPERATING 
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A OPERATING LEADER ON THE INTERNET WE HAVE A 
HUGE GROCERY BUSINESS THE LARGEST 
IN THE WORLD WE HAVE A RAPIDLY 
EXPANDING GENERAL MERCHANDISE 
BUSINESS AND NOW WE ARE MOVING ON 
TO AN ENTERTAINMENT SITE WE HAVE 
INVESTED HEAVILY INTO IT TO MAKE 
SURE WE HAVE ALL OF THE RIGHT 
PRODUCTS AND THEY CAN BE EASILY 
ACCESSED AT COMPETITIVE PRICES 
THERE IS A MAJOR LAUNCH COMING UP 
IN SEPTEMBER SO WE THINK IT WILL 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
THIRTY THOUSAND NEW JOBS 
CREATED THE ISSUE HOW MANY IN THE 
U. K. 
ABOUT A THIRD OF THEM SO U. K. TESCO'S IS A BRITISH SUCCESS STORY 
IT IS GOOD WE CAN EXPAND WE ARE 
FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WE CAN CREATE 
JOBS JOBS THAT IS ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR 
NOW NOW LOTS OF PEOPLE SENDING E. MAILS 
ABOUT THAT AS WELL 
A CASE PERHAPS OF TOO MUCH 
TESTOSTERONE TESTOSTERONE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT GO 
NOW SAVE US ALL A BIT OF TIME IF 
YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN CUT IT 
WHY WOMEN RATHER THAN MACHO MEN 
LIKE DAVID BRENT SHOULD BE WORKING 
IN THE WILD WORLD OF FINANCE

ENGLAND POLICE HAVE ALWAYS SAID 
THEY WOULD FIND THE KILLER THEY 
HAVE ASSURED RHYS'S PARENTS THAT 
THEY WOULD FIND THE MAN OR THE 
WOMAN WHO FIRED THE GUN THAT KILLED 
THE SCHOOLBOY BUT THE NION HAS 
GONE QUIET BUT ON THE FACE OF IT

THE BANKS TO DO THEIR BIT THEY SAY 
THAT BILLIONSS HAVE BEEN PUMPED

A DUTY TO PASS ON THE INTEREST RATE 
CUTS TO HOME OWNERS THIS IS A 
TRICKY TIME FOR GORDON BROWN ONE 
POLL SUGGESTED THAT PEOPLE DON'T 
TRUST THIS GOVERNMENT TO GET THEM 
THROUGH THE HARD TIMES DOWNING 
STREET SAY WE DON'T WHERE THE DOWN

DIFFICULT TIME AND A TEST OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC COMPETENCE 
BUT DOWNING STREET SAYS GORDON 
BROWN IS THE MAN TO GET US THROUGH 
THAT 
THANK YOU LET'S TALK TO THAT AARON AT THE STOCK EXCHANGE THINGS 
LOOKING ROSY FOR TESCO 
YES GIVEN 
THESE TIMES TOES COE SOME HEALTHY 
RESULTS THEY HAVE BEEN OUT IN THE 
PAST HOUR THEY HAD AN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN PER CENT RISE 
IN PROFIT THAT COMES IN AT OVER 
TWO N. T. EIGHT BILLION GROUP SALES UP 
OVER FIFTY ONE BILLION THAT IS A RISE OF 
ELEVEN PER CENT LIKE FOR LIKE SALES ARE UP 
THREE POINT FIVE PER CENT GLOBAL SALES ARE UP OVER TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
THE KEY ISSUE IS FOOD PRICES THE 
RISE IN FOOD PRICES WE HAD A LOT 
OF E. MAILS FROM VIEWERS 
COMPLAINING ABOUT TESCO'S PRICE 
RISES SO I ASKED THE BOSS OF TESCO 
ARE THE PRICE HIKES JUSTIFIED WELL WELL PRICES ARE RISING ACROSS THE BOARD 
TAKING FOOD AND NON FOOD TOGETHER 
THEY HAVE GONE UP AROUND FIFTEEN PER CENT IN 
TESCO FOR MANY YEARS PRICES WENT 
DOWN IN TESCO IT HAS BEEN A GOOD 
CONTRIBUTION TO PEOPLE'S WEEKLY 
BUDGET BUT THEY ARE NOT RISING BY 
THE AMOUNT THAT SOME OF THE 
HEADLINES WOULD SUGGEST THE 
INCREASES ARE MORE MUTED THAN SOME 
OF THE MORE ALARMING FIGURES 
BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO 
KEEP A LID ON PRICES NOW ISOLATED 
PRODUCTS DO GO UP MORE BREAD AND 
CHICK VN GONE UP BECAUSE OF THE 
GRAIN PRICES BUT OTHER PRODUCTS 
HAVE COME DOWN THE OVERALL FIGURE 
IS AROUND FIFTEEN PER CENT 
TERRY LEAHY AND I 
HAVE TO SAY THEY TRIED TO KEEP A 
CAP ON THE PRICES BUT THOSE E. 
MAILS WE RECEIVED PEOPLE ARE VERY 
HOT UNDER THE COLLAR THEY SAY A 
LOT OF THE PRICE RISES ARE 
UNJUSTIFIED 
THANK YOU TWELVE BRITISH UNJUSTIFIED STUDENTS WHO SURVIVED THE BUS CRASH

MISSING AN IRAQI TEENAGER WHO WAS 
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT BY A BRITISH 
SOLDIER WILL RECEIVE TWO MILLION IN 
COMPENSATION T. BOY SUFFERED SPINAL 
INJURIES WHICH LEFT HIM PARALYSED

SILVIO BERLUSCONI HAS WON A THIRD 
TERM AS ITALY'S PRIME MINISTER THE 
SEVENTY ONE YEAR OLD WARNED OF DIFFICULT 
MONTHS AHEAD HE PROMISED ACTION TO 
TACKLE THE ECONOMY HIS PRIORITYS

NAPLES A POSTMORTEM WILL BE 
CARRIED ON ON THE BODY OF THE T. V. 
PRESENTER MARK SPEIGHT HIS 
FRIENDS SAY HE HAS BEEN H. B. IN A 
VULNERABLE STATE AFTER THE DEATH OF 
HIS DEEIAN SAY FROM T. O. D. A Y. FIVE PER CENT OF 
PETROL MUST BE MADE FROM BIOFUELS 
FROM PLANTS IT IS PART OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE 
CARBON EMISSIONS BUT 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS QUESTION WHETHER 
IT WILL HELP THE ENVIRONMENT CARS 
FUEL BID CROPS THE OIL 
S. D. 
RAPE 
WILL BE USED TO MAKE BIODIESEL 
JUST ESTABLISHING ITSELF HERE IS 
WHEAT TO PRODUCE A PETROL 
SUBSTITUTE FROM TODAY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF 
FUEL MUST BE BIOFUEL THE 
GOVERNMENT SET ITS TARGETS THERE 
WAS AGREEMENT THAT THIS WAS A GOOD 
SOLUTION NOW SOME 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THAT IS JUST 
NOT TRUE 
TOMORROW WHEN YOU GO AND 
FILL UP YOUR CAR THERE MAYBE PALM 
OIL THERE THAT WAS GROWING 
SOMEWHERE THAT WAS A TROPICAL RAIN 
FOREST TWO YEARS AGO THERE IS 
NOTHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
DONE TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING 
THE BIOFUELS THEY ARE NOT 
SUSTAINABLE 
MAKE NO MISTAKE SUSTAINABLE BIOFUMES ARE A BIG BUSINESS THIS 
SITE WILL BECOME A HUGE BIO FUEL 
PLANT 
THE FUEL FROM THIS PLANT IF PLANT YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN 
WILL TAKE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CARS OFF 
THE U. K. ROADS 
EVEN SO THERE ARE 
SIGNS THAT CONCERNS ABOUT BIODIESEL 
ARE SPREADING TODAY THE PRIME 
MINISTER IS TO CALL FOR AN URGENT 
REVIEW OF HOW BIOFUEL PRODUCTION 
PLAYS INTO THE GLOBAL FOOD SHORTAGE 
THOSE ARE THE MAIN STORIES STILL 
TO COME A CAT CURL UP CURLED 
UP IN ITS FAVOURITE PLACE SCENES 
FROM OUR DAILY LIVES CAUGHT IN 
CAMERA WE WILL TALK TO A MUM WHO 
APPEARS IN A NEW BOOK ABOUT BRITAIN 
AT HOME THEY HAD ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
PHOTOGRAPHS YES 
THEY HAD TO GET PHOTOGRAPHS YES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OUT 
THE FRONT PAGE OF THE 
DAILY MAIL THEY HAVE THE STORY 
ABOUT THE FASTEST RISE IN THE COST 
OF FOOD FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS ALMOST THE 
SAME HEADLINE ON THE DAILY EXPRESS 
THE TIMES SAYS GORDON BROWN'S TRADE 
MINISTER DIGBY JONES HAS SAID HE 
WILL RESIGN BECAUSE HE WON'T 
SUPPORT THE PRIME MINISTER 
A LAST 
E. MAIL SENT FROM ONE OF THE GIRLS 
KILLED IN THAT BUS CRASH TO HER 
PARENTS SHE SAID THANKS FOR 
GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO DO THIS AND 
GIVING ME SUCH A LOVELY HOME SO 
NOTHING COULD STOP ME FROM COMING 
BACK 
THE TELEGRAPH HAS A PICTURE BACK OF HER PARENTS AND SAYS THE HOUSE 
PRICES ARE EXPERIENCING THEIR MOST 
WIDESPREAD DECLINE SINCE RECORDS 
BEGAN BECAUSE OF THE CREDIT CRISIS 
THE GUARDIAN HARRY POTTER J. K. 
ROWLING'S IN COURT BECAUSE 
SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO WRITE AN 
ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND SHE IS CLAIMING 
THAT IS ROBBING HER LIFE'S WORK 
THE INDEPENDENT HAS ANOTHER SIDE OF 
THE BIOFUELS DEBATE THE QUESTION 
BECAUSE THERE IS MORE LAND SET 
ASIDE FOR BIOFUEL CROPS AND THE 
RAIN FORESTS ARE GETTING BURNT TOO 
AND INSIDE POOR JACK THIS IS JACK 
HE HAS BEEN DRIVING FOREVER HALF A 
MILLION MILES AND NEVER HAD A 
PARKING TICK T. AND MADE A SLIGHT 
MISTAKE REVERSING HIS CAR HE HE MANAGED TO FLIP HIS CAR OVER AND AND WENT INTO TWO PORSCHES COSTING 
SIXTY THOUSAND HE WAS SO UPSET HE HAS 
GIVEN UP DRIVING 
HE DID OFFER TO 
SWEEP UP THE GLASS 
THAT PROBABLY 
DIDN'T HELP WITH THAT DENT NEVER 
REVERSE YOUR CAR NEAR A PORSCHE 
DEALERSHIP NOW WE WOMEN ARE GENTLE 
AND CALM 
WHEREAS WE MEN ARE A 
MACHO LOT WHO GET HIGH ON MAKING 
MONEY 
APPARENTLY IF FINANCIAL MONEY INSTITUTIONS EMPLOYED MORE OF US 
THERE WOULD BE LESS TURMOIL ON THE 
STOCK MARKETS 
HERE IS DAVID BRENT 
GIVING A MOTIVATIONAL TALK IN HIS 
OWN MACHO STYLE 
I'M GOING TO MAKE 
LIKE A BANANA AND SPLIT HE GOT IT 
BEFORE I GO THOUGH PROMISE ME YOU 
WILL REMEMBER ONE THING YEAH JUST 
REMEMBER 
YOU'RE THE BEST REMEMBER BETTER THAN ALL THE REST 
COME ON 
LISTEN TO HER COME ON GET INTO 
IT YEAH WE HAVE TWO DIVEST GUESTS 
GOOD MORNING L. CAN SEE YOU DOING 
THAT SIMPLY THE BEST 
I WOULD 
RATHER NOT 
YOU ARE TRADITIONAL RED 
BRACES ARE A TESTAMENT TOURE 
TESTOSTERONE 
IT IS THE RIGHT TESTOSTERONE COLOUR 
BLOOD IS THERE TOO MUCH COLOUR TESTOSTERONE ON THE TRADING FLOOR 
YOU NEED THAT ENERGY AND AGGRESSION 
TO DO TRADES WHAT YOU DON'T WANT 
IS THAT SAME PEOPLE RUNNING THE 
SHOP THEN ITS WILL BE CHAOS SO 
YOU NEED CERTAIN LEVEL OF 
ENTHUSIASM CALL IS TES WHATEVER 
BUT THEY GET TO A CERTAIN LEVEL AND 
THEN STOP IT AND YOU NEED COOL 
PEOPLE RUNNING IT OR YOU END WITH 
THE WRONG PEOPLE RUNNING IT 
IT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY THEY'RE 
SAYING THE MORE TESTOSTERONE 
PERHAPS THE MORE MONEY YOU MAKE IN 
THE CITY 
I THINK TESTOSTERONE 
EGOS RISK TAKING GALLONS A BIT TOO 
FAR YOU DO NEED SOMEONE SENSIBLE 
MANAGING OVER IT I'M JUST THRILLED 
THAT THE BOYS ARE GETTING A HARD 
TIME FOR THEIR HORMONES FOR ONCE 
IT MAY BE FUELLING PERSONAL PROFIT 
BUT IT ALSO FUELS DISASTER 
SOMETIMES WHEN THE MARKETS MOVE IN 
A VOLATILE WAY THESE GUYS RESPOND 
LIKE RAGING BULLS AND THAT'S THE 
PROBLEM ISN'T IT 
AND THEY'RE 
GENERALLY RISK TAKERS YOU FIND 
THAT MALE TRADERS ARE HAPPY TO TAKE 
GREATER RISKS FEMALE TRADERS TEND 
TO THINK ABOUT IT MORE MY CHIEF 
INVESTMENT OFFICER IS A WOMAN AND 
HAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT OUTLOOK 
FROM THE BOYS WHO WILL BE MUCH MORE 
BULLISH ABOUT THINGS WE CAN MAKE 
MONEY ON THIS SHE'LL SAY TO HOLD 
HARD IT IS GENERALLY THAT 
DIFFERENCE IT'S MATTER OF HAVING 
PROPER CONTROL 
IS THAT WHAT THEY 
NEED STRONG WOMEN TO LOOK AFTER 
THEM 
I THINK IN LOTS OF THEM CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DO BUT I THINK 
IT'S A LITTLE EXTREME SAYING WE 
SHOULD REPLACE ALL YOUNG MEN WITH 
WOMEN AND OLDER MEN IN ORDER TO 
SECURE IT L. THINK IT'S JUST ABOUT 
TEACHING MEN THAT YES THEY ARE 
SUCCESSFUL BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE 
TO WIND YOUR NECK IN AND REALISE 
THAT THAT RISK ISN'T NECESSARY YOU YOU CAN'T TEACH THESE GUYS THESE YOUNG 
BUCKS ANYTHING CAN YOU THAT'S 
CHEMICALLY THE WAY THEY ARE THE THE CITY IS YOU WERE IN COMPETITION 
YOU'RE THERE TO TRY TWENTY MAKE MONEY 
FOR PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT THERE TO BE 
ORDERLY OR DULL OR PUSH A BIT OF 
PAPER AROUND IT'S ZIEPBLD TO BE 
LIKE THAT BUT IT IS LIKE HERDING 
CATTLE YOU HAVE TO ENSURE THEY'RE 
PROPERLY PENNED IN OTHERWISE YOU'LL 
HAVE RAGING BULLS 
EMPLOYERS ARE 
NOT STUPID THESE YOUNG MEN WITH 
TESTOSTERONE ARE MAKING THE MONEY 
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE EMPLOYING THEM 
EXACTLY BUT YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE 
THE TEAM AROUND TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT YOU HAVE TO 
HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAIBLGING 
THE MONEY AND YOU NEED THE PEOPLE 
TO KEEP THEM IN CHECKING SO MAKE 
SURE ADMIN IS DONE 
WHO DO YOU LIKE 
TO WORK WITH MEN 
HAVE YOU EVER MEN SUFFERED FROM TESTOSTERONE 
OVERLOAD 
I WORK WITH MEN WHO GO OVERLOAD ROUND HIGH FIVEING AND I THINK 
THAT'S TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE FOR 
MEN IN SUITS AND SHOULD BE BANNED 
NEVER OFFICE L. FIND IT HARD WHEN 
MEN ARE DOING THE WHOLE EGO THING 
WOMEN TEND TO GET ON WITH IT BURY 
THEIR HEADS AND GET ON WITH THE 
WORK 
ON THE CURRENT SERIES OF THE WORK APPRENTICE AT THE BEGINNING OF 
EVERY TASK THEY'RE HAND CLAPPING 
AND SAYING I'LL GIVE TWO HUNDRED NINETY PER CENT YES YES IT IS HORRIBLY BRUTEISH STUFF BUT 
SOMETHING DOES GO ON IN THE LAST 
FEW MONTHS WE'VE HAD BEAR STEARNS 
AND IN FRANCE SO MUCH OF A LOSS 
FROM ONE TRADER AND BACK IN THE 
TIME OF MR. NICK LEESON THESE WERE 
HIGH POWERED TRADERS WHO AT THEIR 
TIME WERE SUCCESSFUL AND THEN GONE 
OUT OF THEIR CONTROL SO WAS IT 
THEIR FAULT OR THE BORING 
CONTROLLERS WHO DIDN'T UNDERSTAND 
WHAT WAS GOING ON 
AND WHEN THEY 
FALL THEY FALL FROM A GREAT HEIGHT 
IT'S A MASSIVE RISK 
AND TAKE 
EVERYTHING WITH THEM IT WAS THE 
BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES THEY 
CALLED THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE 
UNIVERSE ON WALL STREET DO THEY 
STILL DO THAT 
THAT EGO CARRIES ON 
BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S FAILING 
MISERABLY THE LIKES OF BEAR 
STEARNS AND THE OTHER BIG BANKS 
WILL BE SUFFERING AND I'M AFRAID IN 
THE CITY A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE 
LOSING THEIR JOBS 
MAYBE WE SHOULD 
BE CHANGING THE COLOUR OF THOSE 
BRACES HOW ABOUT PINK 
AFRAID NOT 
STILL TO COME THIS MORNING 
HAVING A BAD DAY 
I HAD A BAD PUPIL 
WHAFRPBLGTS DID HE DO HE WAS LATE 
HE REFUSED TO PAY MISMONEY LAPLD 
THE DOOR AND SWORE AT ME 
DRIVEN TO 
DISTRACTION ONE ANGRY DRIVING 
INSTRUCTOR IN THE FILM HAPPY GO 
LUCKY LUCKY I'LL BE TELLING YOU WHY THESE GREY 
SQUIRRELS ARE BEING CULLED IN ORDER 
TO HELP PROTECT THESE NATIVE 
BRITISH RED SQUIRRELS 
THEY DON'T WANT ANY SQUIRRELS ON 
THIS PIECE OF LAWN THIS WAS FIRST 
LAID FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO ELIZABETH WAS 
IN THE TOWER OF LONDON AT THE TIME 
NOW THIS BOWLING CLUB IS UNDER 
THREAT BECAUSE THE MEMBERS SAY A 
LOT OF PEOPLE IN THEIR FIFTIES AND SIXTIES 
ARE NOT BECOMING MEMBERS AND TOENT 
WANT TO VOLUNTEER THEIR FREE TIME 
DON'T WANT TO VOLUNTEER THEIR FREE 
TIME ANY MORE 
NOW AN UPDATE ON THE 
WEATHER 
NOW AN UPDATE ON THE WEATHER YOU CAN SEE IN GLOUCESTER AND 
STROUD NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY BUT 
STILL RATHER CHILLY TEMPERATURES 
AROUND FREEZING THAT'S THE GENERAL 
OUTLOOK AT THE MOMENT ACROSS 
ENGLAND AND WALES THERE'S PLENTY 
OF CLEAR SKIES AND SUNSHINE BUT 
IT'S CHILLY START HOWEVER YET 
AGAIN IT WILL BE ANOTHER DAY OF 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS I'M AFRAID 
ONE OF THE REASONS BEING THAT 
THERE'S FRONT AT THE MOMENT 
MOVING OUT OF SCOTLAND YOU CAN SEE 
IT CLEARLY ON THE SATELLITE PICTURE 
BRINGING SOME OUTBREAKS OF RAIN AS 
IT MOVES INTO NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
NORTHERN ENGLAND IT CAN FRAGMENT 
CONSIDERABLY SO IT WILL BE SHOWERS 
RATHER THAN RAIN BUT NEVERTHELESS 
IT DOES MEAN GREY WET SCENARIO 
BRIGHTER AND DRIER TO THE NORTH AND 
WEST OF SCOTLAND BUT I THINK IN 
BETWEEN THESE SHOWERY OUTBREAKS THE 
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP BY GOOD 
THREE OR FOUR DEGREES SO IT'S A 
CHILLY AFFAIR WHEN THE SHOWERS HIT 
INTO EAST ANGLIA AND THAT SOUTH 
EASTERN CORNER IT'S A CLEAR BUT 
SUNNY START THAT'S THE SAME STORY 
DOWN THROUGH THE SOUTH COAST AND 
SOUTH WEST COAST ONE OR TWO 
SHOWERS IN WALES AND INTO NORTHERN 
IRELAND BUT FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT ONCE THE 
SHOWERS EASES AWAY YOU WILL SEE 
SOME BRIGHTER WEATHER CONDITIONS 
EXPECTED INTO THE AFTERNOON 
THAT FRONTAL SYSTEM SLIPS SLOWLY 
SOUTH BRINGING SHOWERS WITH IT IT 
PUSHES DOWN INTO CENTRAL WALES THE 
MIDLANDS AND LINCOLNSHIRE BY THE 
MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON BUT I 
THINK SOUTHERN PARTS OF SUFFOLK 
EAST ANGLIA GENERALLY AND THE 
SOUTH EAST CORNER WILL STAY DRY AND 
BRIGHT TO THE NORTH BRIGHTER BUT 
ABOUT EIGHT TO ELEVEN THE SHOWERS WILL 
REACH THE SOUTH EAST OVERNIGHT 
LINGER FOR A TIME SO NOT AS COLD 
START TO THE DAY TOMORROW BUT A 
LITTLE DAMP 
BUT THAT'S WHERE WE'LL HAVE THE 
SUNSHINE IN THE NORTH AND WEST 
THE CLOUD RUNNING IN OFF THE NORTH 
SEA LINGERING AROUND LINCOLNSHIRE 
NOT TOO MANY BUT THEY'LL BE THERE 
NUISANCE VALUES INTO THE AFTERNOON 
FRESHER WINDS STARTS TO PICK UP 
FROM THURSDAY ONWARDS BUT DRY 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY BUT IT LOOKS 
LIKE IT WILL BE UNSETTLED FOR THE 
START 
START OF THE WEEKEND 
THANK YOU 
NOW THEY MIGHT LOOK CUTE AND 
CUDDLY BUT IN NORTHUMBERLAND 
THEY'RE IN THE LINE OF FIRE 
THOUSANDS OF GREY SQUIRRELS HAVE 
BEEN CULLED SO JUST WHY HAVE THE 
ANIMALS BECOME THE BADIES RAY 
MONDAY BUCHANAN IS IN WYTHAM FOR US 
NOW NOW GOOD MORNING THIS IS A VERY 
TEMPTING HAZELNUT SELECTION VERY 
TEMPTING INDEED FOR THE GREY 
SQUIRREL BUT IF YOU ARE A SQUIRREL 
BE WARNED IF YOU COME INTO A CAGE 
LIKE THIS YOU'RE LIKE LITTLE TO BE 
CAUGHT AND ONCE YOU'RE CAUGHT HERE 
IN NORTHUMBERLAND YOU WILL BE 
CULLED THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW 
AREAS LEFT IN THE U. K. WHERE YOU CAN 
SEE THE NATIVE BRITISH RED SQUIRREL 
SO THEY'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF ITS 
COMPETITOR THE NORTH AMERICAN GREY 
HAL PARKER DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS A 
CONSERVATIONIST BUT HE CONSERVES BY 
KILLING MR. PARKER CULLS SQUIRRELS 
FOR A LIVING TO BE SPECIFIC GREY 
SQUIRRELS JUST LIKE THIS ONE 
WE'RE TAKING THIS ONE AWAY TODAY 
BECAUSE THEY'RE CARRYING SQUIRREL 
POBGS WHICH KILLS REDS 
AS SOON AS THEY PICK UP THE POX 
THE SQUIRRELS ARE DEAD WITHIN THREE 
WEEKS WEEKS THEY'VE KILLED CHICKS GET INTO 
NEST BOXES AND THEY EAT EGGS IN 
LITTLE OVER A YEAR THIS GOVERNMENT 
SPONSORED TRAPPER HAS KILLED 
AROUND SEVENTY THOUSAND GREY SQUIRRELS 
ACROSS NORTHUMBERLAND IT'S 
ESTIMATED FIFTEEN THOUSAND HAVE BEEN KILLED 
IN LITTLE OVER A YEAR THE REASON 
GIVEN FOR THE CULL IS TO SAVE THE 
NATIVE RED ITS NUMBERS ARE TINY IF 
COMPARISON TO ITS NORTH AMERICAN 
GREY COMPETITOR WOODLAND BY 
WOODLAND COUNTY BY COUNTY GREYS 
HAVE COLONYISED AND DOMINATED 
EVERYONE RECOGNISES THE IMPORTANCE 
OF CONTROLLING THAT SPREAD BUT SOME 
BELIEVE MASS CULLING IS THE WRONG 
SOLUTION 
IT IS ETHICALLY DUBIOUS SOLUTION KILLING ONE SPECIES FOR THE SAKE OF 
ANOTHER UP UNTIL EARLY SEVENTIES YOU 
COULD GET A LICENCE TO KILL RED 
SQUIRRELS SO THEY WERE THE BADIES 
NOW IT'S GREY CIRCLES L. THINK 
AGAINST THAT SORT OF BACKGROUND OF 
TAMPERING AND DRIVING ANIMALS TO 
THE POINT OF EXTINCTION AND THEN 
KILLING THE ANIMALS DRIVING THEM TO 
EXTINCTION IS ETHICALLY DUBIOUS 
HERE IN NORTHUMBRIA THEY INTEND TO 
CONTINUE KILLING THE COUNTY WHEN 
THEY FINISH HERE THEY'LL HEAD SOUTH 
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT 
HAPPENS TO ALL THOSE GREY SQUIRRELS 
THEY'RE NOW BEING SOLD AS THE 
LATEST GAME DELICACY 
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN INDICATION OF 
THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THE GREY 
VERSUS THE RED THE GREY IS ON THIS 
SIDE A LOT LARGER IT'S A LOT 
BOULDER AND MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL 
WHEN IT COMES TO BREEDING THEY 
WERE INTRODUCED INTO THIS COUNTRY 
AROUND ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO SINCE THEN 
THEIR POPULATION HAS BOOMED 
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE TO FIVE 
MILLION MILLION COMPARE THAT WITH THE STORY OF THE 
BRITISH NATIVE RED SQUIRREL THE 
ONLY PLACES IN ENGLAND YOU'RE 
LIKELY TO SEE THEM ARE 
NORTHUMBERLAND AND CUMBRIA ONLY 
LIKELY TO SEE THIRTY THOUSAND LEFT 
ALSO CONSERVATIONISTS POINT OUT 
THAT THIS NORTH AMERICAN GREY 
CARRIES THE SQUIRREL POX VIRUS 
WHICH DOES IT NO HARM BUT WHEN IT 
PASSES ON TO THE BRITISH RED IT CAN 
BE LETHAL AND IT WILL DIE WITHIN 
COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT'S ONE OF THE 
REASONS WHY HERE IN NORTHUMBERLAND 
THEY'RE SO KEEN TO KILL THE GREYS 
AND KEEP THE REDS WE KNOW YOU'VE 
EATEN SQUIRREL WHAT DID YOU EAT IT 
WITH WHAT WAS IT LIKE 
RIGHT IT 
WASN'T NUTY FIRST OF ALL THAT'S 
THE IMPORTANT THING TO SAY BUT I 
HAD A LITTLE BIT OF SQUIRREL A 
LITTLE BIT OF LOIN AND IT WAS 
COOKED WITH A BIT OF THYME STIR 
FRIED IT WAS VERY TASTEY IT WAS 
SWEET MEAT A BIT LIKE RABBIT AND 
IT'S POPULAR AROUND HERE GAME 
DEALERS ARE SELLING IT DOZENS BY 
THE DAY ONE VERY POSH LOCAL 
RESTAURANT I'M TOLD TOOK FORTY 
SQUIRRELS AND WAS SELLING THEM AS A 
STARTER FOR AROUND SIXTEEN PERHAPS IT 
MIGHT BE THE NEXT BIG CULINARY

YOU NEVER LOOK AT MACK PALACE IS 
THAT RIGHT AND YOU WEAR LUCKY 
PANTS BILL 
I DO A LOT OF WOOD 
TOUCHING 
THAT IS WHEN YOU GO TO TOUCHING WATCH WYCOMBE WANDERERS WELL IN 
AMERICA THE NEW YORK YANKEES SPENT 
FIVE HOURS DRILLING INTO THE 
FOUNDATIONS OF THE NEW STADIUM 
WHY WELL THEY FOUND OUT THAT THE 
CONSTRUCTION WORKER HAD BURIED A 
RED SOX SHIRT THERE THEY BURIED 
THROUGH TO FULL BACK OF CONCRETE 
AND THE OFFENDING JOSIE WAS REMOVED 
THREW TWO F. T. OF CONCRETE THERE IT 
IS THROUGH TWO F. T. OF CONCRETE 
JERSEY AN INCREDIBLE STORY 
I LOVE 
THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY 
I DO LIKE 
THE IDEA WE HAVE HAD A FEW E. MAILS 
SOME TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR FANS WHO 
WANT TO REMAIN NAMELESS SAYING 
THEY KNOW FOR SURE THAT SOME 
TOTTENHAM SHIRTS ARE BURIED IN THE 
CONCRETE AT THE EMIRATES STADIUM 
THAT IS WHY ARSENAL HAVE NOT WON 
ANYTHING SO FAR AND ANOTHER ONE 
SAYING THAT AT THE STADIUM OF LIGHT 
A NUMBER OF NEWCASTLE UNITED SHIRTS 
WERE BURIED IN THE FOUNDATIONS 
THERE WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THAT 
IS TRUE OR NOT 
THEY ARE JUST 
WINDING THEM UP SO THAT THEY HAVE 
TO SPEND LOADS OF MONEY LOOKING FOR 
THEM 
SINCE ARSENAL MOVED TO THE THEM EMIRATES HAVE THEY WON ANYTHING 
NO I HAVE GOT SOMETHING HAS TO 
TELL YOU ABOUT THE MASAI WARRIORS 
ONE PERSON WAS ILL WELL YESTERDAY 
HE DID COMPLETE THE LONDON MARATHON 
HE PICKED UP HIS MEDAL HE DID NOT 
WANT TO GO HOME BEING THE ONLY ONE 
WHO HAD NOT COMPLETED THE COURSE 
WHAT THEY NEED AT THE ANNA ITS IS A 
PIED PIPER SORT OF FIGURE 
HE OR 
OTHER MAN WHAT THEY NEED AT THE 
EMIRATES STADIUM IS A PIED PIPER 
SORT OF FIGURE 
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THERE IS A 
COMMERCIAL ON T. V. WHERE THEY PLAY A 
TUNE MADE ENTIRELY FROM CAR PARTS 
WE WILL BE STICKING TO THE MAN WHO 
HAS PUT THEM TOGETHER 
WE ARE 
HOPING THAT HE CAN BE A BIT BETTER 
AT PLAYING THEM THAN BILL 
NOW IT 
IS TWENTY TO NINE IT SEEMS THAT ESTATE 
AGENTS ARE PRETTY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE 
STATE OF THE HOUSING MARKET IT 
IS EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY THE ROYAL INSTITUTE OF 
CHARTERED SURVEYORS SAYS THE GLOOMY 
OUTLOOK IS BECAUSE OF THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH WHICH HAS LED TO DRASTIC 
CUTS IN MORTGAGE LENDING HOW 
WORRIED SHOULD WE BE MARTIN 
ROBERTSON IS HERE NOW YOU MIGHT BE 
PARTICULARLY WORRIED BECAUSE YOU 
HAVE GOT A BOOK OUT CALLED MAKING 
MONEY FROM A PROPERTY MARKETS IS 
THAT RIGHT 
YES IN THE WEEK WHEN 
IT IS ALL GOING OFF IN THE PROPERTY 
MARKET BUT I THINK NOW MORE THAN 
AT ANY OTHER TIME YOU NEED TO GET 
GOOD ADVICE AND YOU NEED TO TAKE 
SOME ACTIVE STEPS TO PROTECT 
YOURSELF WHEN THE MARKET IS GOING 
DOWN A FEW YEARS AGO YOU COULD 
BUY ANYTHING DO ANYTHING TO IT AND 
YOU WOULD MAKE MONEY NOW YOU NEED 
TO BUY CAREFULLY BE CAREFUL ABOUT 
HOW MUCH YOU SPEND AND BE 
PROACTIVE ABOUT YOUR FINANCES SORT 
OUT YOUR MORTGAGE TO THE BEST 
POSSIBLE RATES GO INTEREST ONLY 
AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF GETTING GETTING A MORTGAGE OF ANY SORT IS HARD AT 
THE MOMENT 
IT IS A GOOD TURN TO 
SPEAK TO A REALLY GOOD MORTGAGE 
BROKER I HAVE TO SAY IF YOU ARE 
IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE CONSIDER 
MOVING TO AN INTEREST ONLY MORTGAGE 
THERE ARE STEPS YOU CAN TAKE IF YOU 
ARE TRYING TO SELL IT IS A 
DIFFICULT 
IS NO 
DOUBT ABOUT IT THE HOUSING MARKET 
IS ABOUT CONFIDENCE AND CLEARLY 
PEOPLE ARE VERY WORRIED AT THE 
MOMENT A FEW YEARS AGO YOU WOULD 
STICK IT OUT BUT NOW PEOPLE ARE 
ACCEPTING LOWER OFFERS BUT IF 
YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL YOU HAVE TO 
BE PROACTIVE MAKE YOUR HOUSE STAND 
OUT FROM THE CROWD WHEN IT COMES 
TO BUYING YOU CAN NEGOTIATE QUITE 
HARD ON THE PRICE 
WHAT WOULD YOU 
RECOMMEND DO YOU THINK EVERYBODY 
SHOULD JUST HOLD OFF IF THEY 
POSSIBLY CAN BOTH BUYING AND 
SELLING OR IS IT POSSIBLY THE TIME 
TO BUY 
I THINK THE SERIOUS 
PROPERTY INVESTORS THAT FINAL ARE 
BUYING LIKE CRAZY AT THE MOMENT 
BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF 
UNCERTAINTY AND PEOPLE ARE WILLING 
TO TAKE LOWER PRICES THEY VIEW 
THIS AS A MEDIUM TO LONG TERM 
INVESTMENT HISTORY SAYS THAT OVER 
THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM YOU KNOW 
WE LIVE ON OUR ISLAND THERE IS A 
LIMITED AMOUNT OF HOUSES SO 
SUPPLY AND DEMAND MARKET FORCES 
SAY THAT THERE IS MORE DEMAND AND 
SUPPLY IT IS SCARY AT THE MOMENT 
IF YOU HAVE GOT AN OVERPRICED 
MORTGAGE IT IS HARD DON'T GET ME 
WRONG 
BUT WHY WOULD ANYBODY BUY IN WRONG A MARKET THAT IS STILL FALLING WE 
DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS EVEN CLOSE 
TO BOTTOMING OUT 
O. K. BUT IF I GIVE 
YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY IN 
LONDON IN NINETEEN NINETY YOU PROBABLY WOULD 
AT THOSE PRICES WOULDN'T YOU SO 
IF YOU VIEW IT AS A MEDIUM TO LONG 
TERM INVESTMENT IT PROBABLY IS 
WORTH IT TIGHTEN YOUR BELT AND 
SECURITY OF FINANCES DON'T PANIC 
THESE ARE PEOPLE'S HOMES 
THEY ARE 
TO BE FAIR FOR MOST PEOPLE IF 
THEY ARE NOT INVESTORS IF IT GOES 
UP OR DOWN IN VALUE ON A PRACTICAL 
BASIS IT DOES NOT REALLY AFFECT 
THEM IT IS ONLY WHEN YOU COME TO 
TRY AND SELL IT IS A PAPER FEELING 
A FEEL GOOD FACTOR IF YOU THINK IT 
HAS DROPPED YOU DON'T FEEL TOO 
GOOD BUT THE REALITY IS THAT ON A 
DAY TO DAY BASIS APART FROM PAYING 
THE MORTGAGE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY 
DIFFERENCE 
UNLESS YOU'RE IN DIFFERENCE TROUBLE WITH A ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
MORTGAGE 
THE MAIN THING IS YOU MORTGAGE HAVE GOT TO BE PROACTIVE TALK TO 
YOUR MORTGAGE LENDER BE PROACTIVE 
ABOUT YOUR FINANCES DON'T JUST 
KEEP IGNORING THE LETTERS YOU CAN 
DO THINGS 
WE HAD THAT TERRIBLE 
SITUATION IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES WHERE 
PEOPLE GOT RID OF THEIR PROPERTIES 
AND WERE STILL OWING MONEY YES YES BUT THE PEOPLE WHO HUNG IN THERE 
THEY WERE O. K. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US

FENDER IS A MAKER OF 
GUITARS THE NECK IS THE BIT 
BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND THE DOOR

HAS NOTHING BUT CAR PARTS THESE WE 
CALLED HYBRIDS THEY ARE A 
COMBINATION OF A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT

REFINED AND LIKE A POLISHED FRUIT 
A MOUTHPIECE 
I AM FASCINATED BY

THANKS VERY MUCH 
NOW WHEN THE SPANISH ARMADA WAS 
SIGHTED IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT FRANCIS DRAKE WAS 
SAID TO BE PLAYING BOWLS 
APPARENTLY HE FINISHED A GAME 
BEFORE HE TOOK TO THE SEA 
HE WOULDN'T BE PLEASED THAT A 
BOWLING GREEN GOING BACK TO HIS 
TIME IS IN TROUBLE BECAUSE PEOPLE 
ARE NOT BOWLED OVER WITH THE IDEA 
OF HELPING TO RUN THE PLACE 
RICHARD IS NEAR STROUD 
THIS IS THE OLD CLUBHOUSE ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
YEARS OLD WHEN THIS GRASS WAS LAID 
YOU MENTIONED THE SPANISH ARMADA 
THIS WAS LAID THIRTY YEARS BEFORE THEY 
CAME KNOCKING ON THE CLOSE SLAPDASH 
COASTLINE THERE WAS A PIT AS WELL 
WAY YOU COULD GO AND WATCH 
COCKFIGHTS COCKFIGHTS ALL OF THIS TIME THIS CLUB HAS 
SURVIVED NOW THEY ARE STRUGGLING 
BECAUSE THEY SEE PEOPLE IN THE FIFTIES 
AND SIXTIES DON'T WANT TO BECOME 
MEMBERS OR GIVE THEIR FREE TIME ANY 
MORE AND IT IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM 
THE FIRST TIME THEY BOWLED ON THIS 
GREEN QUEEN ELIZABETH WAS STILL 
LOCKED UP IN THE TOWER OF LONDON 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS LATER THE FALCON BOWLING 
CLUB IS UNDER THREAT BECAUSE NO ONE 
WANTS TO VOLUNTEER ANY MORE THAT 
IS NOT BAD 
IT IS GOING FAST WOULD 
YOU BELIEVE THAT 
WHY DO YOU THINK 
LESS PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO COMMIT 
TO A SPORT LIKE BULLS THESE DAYS 
DIFFICULT QUESTION DIFFICULT 
QUESTION IN CLUB SUCH AS OURS 
YOU JUST DON'T NEED PEOPLE TO PLAY 
BOWLS YOU NEED PEOPLE TO HAVE A 
BIT OF COMMITMENT TO HELP AND WORK 
ON THE GREEN TO HELP AND WORK ON 
THE CLUBHOUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE 
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE 
IT MEANS THE 
FUTURE OF ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S 
OLDEST GREENS IS DOWN TO THE SAME 
PEOPLE PUTTING IN THEIR FREE TIME 
YEAR AFTER YEAR 
WE USED TO HAVE A 
MEMBERSHIP OF ABOUT NINETY NOW WE ARE 
DOWN TO JUST OVER SIXTY GRADUALLY IT 
IS GETTING SMALLER THEY THINK IT 
WILL BE REALLY SAD IF THE CLUB THAT 
HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR 
WAS TO CLOSE DOWN 
THEY ARE NOT 
ALONE PAUL'S ENGLAND TELLS ME IT 
IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM MANY 
SMALLER VILLAGE CLUBS ARE 
STRUGGLING FOR MEMBERS BECAUSE 
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO COMMIT 
I LOVE 
IT HERE L. CALL THIS GOD'S LITTLE 
ACRE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE 
ANYWHERE ELSE ON A SUMMER'S DAY IF IF YOU ARE INTERESTED THEY WILL LET 
ANYONE HAVE A GO 
CAN I TELL YOU 
YOUR ACTION YOU STEP FORWARD WAS 
THAT OF A LEFT HANDED BOWLER THIS THIS IS ME FIVE MINUTES LATER HONEST 
IT IS 
IF YOU BELIEVED I BOWLED AT THAT 
YOU WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING WE HAVE 
A COUPLE OF MEMBERS WHO HAVE TURNED 
UP FOR US NORMAN AND DAVID THE 
SECRETARY AND THE CAPTAIN HOW 
SERIOUS IS THIS RECRUITMENT 
PROBLEM 
IT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM PROBLEM NATIONALLY WE SUFFER LOCALLY 
BECAUSE IN THIS CATCHMENT AREA 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CLUBS 
COMPETING FOR MEMBERS WE 
PARTICULARLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE 
APPLICATIONS FROM THOSE WHO HAVE 
PERHAPS GIVEN UP OTHER ACTIVE 
SPORTS BECAUSE THIS IS A SUPER 
GAME SUITABLE FOR MEN WOMEN AND 
THE DISABLED 
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT VOLUNTEERING AND IT SEEMS 
PEOPLE IN THEIR FIFTIES AND SIXTIES ARE 
LESS INCLINED TO COMMIT TIME IS 
THAT WAY YOU HAVE FOUND 
INDEED IT 
IS A GROWING PROBLEM IT IS 
PARTICULARLY OF CONCERN TO US IN 
HIS CLUB ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A 
REASONABLE MEMBERSHIP SADLY THAT 
IS REDUCING DRAMATICALLY WITH AGE 
RELATED PROBLEMS IT IS DIFFICULT 
GETTING PEOPLE TO DO JOBS NORMAN 
HAS BEEN A SECRETARY FOR FOURTEEN YEARS 
OR MORE HE HAS DONE HIS TIME AND 
IT IS ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY ELSE HAD 
A GO 
YOU MIGHT GET SOME MEMBERS 
OUT OF THIS YOU NEVER KNOW L. WON

PEOPLE NOT HIS MATES AND NOT HIS

IT IS CLAIMED MUSLIM INMATES ARE 
BEING RADICALISED AT BELMARSH 
PRISON IN SOUTH EAST LONDON THE 
CHIEF INSPECTOR OF PRISONS SAYS 
OFFICERS ARE INSUFFICIENTLY TRAINED 
TO CHALLENGE EXTREMIST VIEWS 
WITHOUT ALIENATING THE MUSLIM 
POPULATION LET'S FIND OUT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING ON THE ROADS AND PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT THIS MORNING HOW IS IT 
LOOKING 
SOME PROBLEMS FOR MAINLINE LOOKING TRAINS 
ON THE ROADS THE A TWENTY THREE DOWN IN 
STREATHAM VERY BUSY 
LONDON'S WEATHER NOW AND IT WILL 
BE DRY AND SUNNY BUT THERE COULD 
BE SOME RAIN LATER THAT'S ALL FOR NOW BYE BYE 
A WELCOME BACK THE DIRECTOR MIKE 
LEIGH IS KNOWN FOR POWERFUL BUT 
BLEAK FILMS SUCH AS SECRETS AND 
LIES BUT HIS LATEST OFFERING IS 
SOMETHING ALTOGETHER SUNNIER HAPPY 
GO LUCKY IS WHAT IT IS CALLED THE 
STORY OF FUN LOVING TEACHER 
CALLED POPPY ALSO THERE IS A 
RATHER UP TIGHT DRIVING INSTRUCTOR 
CALLED SCOTT FIRST LET'S HAVE 
LOOK AT POPPY'S FIRST DRIVING 
LESSON 
THAT MUST BE FOR YOU 
I AM SO 
EXCITED 
I THINK YOU SHOULD DO SOME EXCITED DEEPER BREATHING BEFORE YOU GET IN 
THE CAR 
WISH ME LUCK 
GOOD LUCK 
I'LL KEEP THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ON 
STANDBY 
HELLO SCOTT 
ARE YOU POPPY THAT'S THAT'S ME NICE TO MEET YOU 
THE CAR IS 
JUST HERE 
THE AIR NOT INFECTED 
THEY ARE CLEAN L. JUST WASHED THEM HONESTLY 
YOU WILL BE IN THE HONESTLY PASSENGER SEAT 
IT IS ME THAT'S 
LEARNING TO DRIVE 
YEAH BUT WE'VE 
GOT TO TALK A FEW THINGS THROUGH 
FIRST 
IF YOU INSIST 
DID YOU FIRST CHOOSE THIS COLOUR CAR SCOTT MAKE MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE 
IT IS A SHORT 
CAR IS THIS YOUR CAR 
IT'S A 
COMPANY CAR MAKE YOUR MIND UP 
HAVE YOU GOT YOUR PROVISIONAL 
DRIVING LICENCE 
YEAH THERE YOU GO 
THAT'S ME ON A BAD DAY 
IS THAT 
YOUR REAL NAME PAULINE O. K. 
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE IN ORDER A A THAT'S GOOD 
HAVE YOU HAD A DRIVING 
LESSON BEFORE 
YEAH NO IT WASN'T 
REALLY A LESSON IT WAS IN A 
CADILLAC MIAMI ON THE BEACH 
THERE IS A FABULOUS LINE LATER 
WHERE HE SAYS THE ROAD TO HELL IS 
PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS SHE 
SAYS IT SOUNDS LIKE FUN IT IS 
SUCH REFRESHING FILM WAS IT LIKE 
THAT TO MAKE 
IT WAS I HAVE KNOWN 
SELLEY FOR EIGHT YEARS THE HARDEST 
THING FOR ME IN MAKING THE FILM WAS 
NOT LAUGHING BECAUSE I PLAY A 
CHARACTER WHO IS SO PENT UP WITH 
RAGE AND FRUSTRATION AND HE TAKES 
IT ALL OUT ON SALLY'S CHARACTER 
POPPY BUT I WAS AWARE OF SALLY'S 
PERFORMANCE WHEN I WAS STUCK IN THE 
CAR WITH HER 
SHE IS JUST 
IRREPRESSIBLY HAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC 
ISN'T SHE IN THE FILM 
SHE IS BUT 
UNDERLYING THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE 
COURAGE AND INTELLIGENCE AND 
SENSITIVITY AND A GREAT SENSE OF 
HUMOUR I THINK THAT IS WHAT THE 
FILM IS ABOUT FOR ME IT'S ABOUT 
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HAPPY GO LUCKY 
AND WHAT IT TAKES TO BE HAPPY GO 
LUCKY YOU SEE IN THE FILM THAT SHE 
IS STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN THIS 
LEVEL OF POSITIVITY WHAT IT MADE 
ME THINK WAS IS BEING HAPPY DUTY 
OR CIRCUMSTANCES OR DO TO YOUR 
ATTITUDE AND YOUR OWN MENTAL WELL 
BEING THAT'S WHAT I THINK THE FILM 
IS ABOUT 
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST 
FILM YOU HAVE MADE WITH MIKE LEIGH 
WHEN YOU WORK WITH HIM IT'S NOT 
LIKE WORKING WITH ANYBODY ELSE IS 
IT LOTS OF IMPROVISATION 
REHEARSAL GETTING TOGETHER FOR 
SOME TIME BEFOREHAND 
YEAH YOU 
SPEND SIX MONTHS REHEARSING THE 
FILM AND THEN THREE OR FOUR MONTHS' 
SHOOTING 
THE FILM IN TERMS OF 
SCRIPT AND SCREENPLAY HOW MUCH OF 
IT IS WRITTEN DOWN BEFOREHAND AND 
HOW MUCH OF IT IS 
NONE OF IT IS 
WRITTEN DOWN NO I NEVER HAVE ANY 
DIALOGUE WRITTEN DOWN FOR ME NONE 
OF THE ACTORS DO 
YOU WORK OUT 
BEFOREHAND 
IS ITS STRUCTURED BEFOREHAND IMPROVISATION YOU EXPLORER 
INVESTIGATE IT'S STRUCTURED ME 
AND SELLEY WERE ON LIPSTICK CAMERAS 
IN THE MOVIE WE WERE ACTUALLY 
DRIVING IN A CAR INDUSTRY WE WERE 
NOT BEING PULLED ALONG A LOT OF 
IMPROVISATION IS REAL INTERACTION 
WITH THE ROAD 
THAT IS 
EXTRAORDINARY NORMALLY YOU'RE ON A 
TROLLEY THING 
OBVIOUSLY IT IS 
DRIVING LESSONS THERE IS A SCENE 
WHERE YOU COME ACROSS TWO BICYCLES 
YEAH TWO BLACK EYES ON BIKE 
THAT CAME OUT OF IMPROVISATION 
YEAH IT CAME OUT BECAUSE SCOTT IS 
AN INHERENT RACIST 
SO YOU HAVE 
REALLY GOT TO EMBRACE THE CHARACTER 
MORE THAN THAN YOU WOULD NORMALLY 
YOU INVESTIGATE THE CHARACTER MORE 
SO THAT WHEN YOU PLAY THE CHARACTER 
YOU'RE IN CHARACTER THERE IS LOT 
MORE KNEW ONCE AT MANY DIFFERENT 
LEVELS NUANCE 
IS THIS GOING TO BE A REGULAR 
OCCURRENCE CHOPPING AND CHANGING 
SORRY SCOTT SOMETHING CAME UP I I HAD TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT ISN'T A 
IS AN APPOINTMENT 
I COULDN'T HELP 
IT 
THE ROAD TO HELL IS PAVED WITH IT GOOD INTENTIONS 
SOUNDS LIKE FUN 
HAVING A BAD DAY ARE YOU 
I HAD A 
BAD PUPIL THIS MORNING HE WAS LATE 
AND REFUSED TO PAY HIS MONEY HE 
SLAMMED THE DOOR AND SWORE AT ME 
YOUR SHOUT AT HIM DID YOU YOU 
SHOW HIM 
HE'S RUDE ARROGANT AND 
OVER CONFIDENT 
DON'T LIKE THAT DO 
YOU 
HE HAS BEEN ENCOURAGED TO YOU EXPRESS HIMSELF 
CHOP HIS HANDS 
OFF 
YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS WHEN OFF THEY EXPRESS THEMSELVES 
GO ON HOW HOW LITTLE DO THEY KNOW HOW LITTLE TO 
THEIR MOTHERS KNOW AND THEY SMILE 
HE IT'S NOT EASY BEING YOU IS IT 
HEY 
SO YOU'RE DRIVING ALONG IN THE HEY CAR DOING THAT MIGHT LEAVE THE 
DIRECTOR IS NOT EXACTLY SITTING ON 
THE BONNET IS HE 
NO HE WAS IN A 
CAR BEHIND US THERE WAS NO MONARCH 
TO SO HE COULD ONLY HEAR US HE 
WOULD PULL OVER HAVE A LOOK AT THE 
MONITORS IN THE BACK GIVE US NOTES 
AND THEN WE WOULD GO AGAIN YOU 
REINVESTIGATED ALL THE TIME HIS HIS FILMS SEEM TO HAVE A DIFFERENT LOOK 
DON'T THEY IT DOES SEEM LIKE REAL 
CONVERSATIONS 
YES THERE ARE MANY CONVERSATIONS DIFFERENT LEVELS ON ONE LEVEL IT 
IS A REALLY KIND OF YOUNG VIBRANT 
VIVID COLOURFUL FILM BUT A LOT OF 
COMEDIES U. C. A. S. O. COMMERCIALLY BASED 
THEY MISS OUT ALL THE OTHER LAYERS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE A 
QUICK BUCK WITH MIKE LEIGH 
BECAUSE HE GOES THROUGH THIS 
PROCESS YOU GET THIS REALLY FUNNY 
COLOURFUL FILM AT DIFFERENT LEVELS 
I WANTED TO TALK CUTE ABOUT THE 
OTHER STUFF THAT YOU'VE DONE YOU
