I'VE LIVED IN AFRICA ALL MY LIFE 
BUT THERE ARE SECRET CORNERS OF THIS VAST CONTINENT I'VE NOT EVEN GLIMPSED 
NOW I'M DETERMINED TO CHANGE THAT 
TO DISCOVER THE WILDLIFE PEOPLE AND LANDSCAPES OF UNKNOWN AFRICA 
FOR DECADES ANGOLA SUFFERED ONE OF THE WORST CIVIL WARS IN THE WORLD 
BUT I'VE HEARD IT USED TO BE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE 
A PARADISE TEEMING WITH WILDLIFE 
BUT WHAT'S IT LIKE NOW AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF BRUTAL CONFLICT 
HAVE ANY OF ITS WILD ANIMALS SURVIVED 
SO THIS IS NED HERE HE'S OUR GUIDE 
NICE TO MEET YOU GUYS 
HE'S GONNA GET US UP SAFELY TO LUANDA HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY 
I'VE HEARD THERE ARE QUITE A FEW LANDMINES STILL 
NO NO THE ROAD WE DRIVE NO LANDMINES 
NO LANDMINES ON THIS ROAD NO NOT THIS ROAD 
FROM HERE ON ANGOLA'S SOUTHERN BORDER IT'S OVER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILES TO LUANDA THE CAPITAL CITY 
BUT WITH MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS TO CROSS THAT COULD TAKE US WEEKS 
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I'M FINALLY HERE 
ANGOLA'S BEEN A FORBIDDEN FRUIT ALL MY LIFE 
IT'S A COUNTRY THAT I'VE BEEN LONGING TO COME TO BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAR IT'S BEEN OUT OF BOUNDS 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT 
DO YOU EVER HAVE ELEPHANTS CROSSING THE RIVER FROM NAMIBIA 
NO NEVER NEVER 
NED'S NEVER SEEN WILDLIFE IN THIS AREA BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING AROUND 
THE LOCAL VILLAGERS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT 
BON DIA 
HAS HE SEEN ANY ANIMALS 
HE HAS COME FROM HUAMBO 
SO FAR AWAY FAR AWAY NOT FROM AROUND HERE SO WE HAVE TO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE O. K. 
IT'S NOT A GREAT START PAULO'S FROM A DIFFERENT AREA 
BUT HE OFFERS TO SHOW US THE WAY TO THE CHIEFS' VILLAGE HOPEFULLY THEY'LL KNOW MORE 
ABOUT THE WILDLIFE THAT'S HERE 
BON DIA 
OH BON DIA SO WHEN DID WHEN DID SHE LAST SEE AN ELEPHANT 
THE LAST TIME AS A YOUNG A YOUNG GIRL YEAH 
SHE WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL I WAS JUST WONDERING IF SHE COULD ACTUALLY 
DRAW FOR ME IN THE SAND THE ANIMALS THAT SHE USED TO SEE AS A CHILD 
SHE CAN'T SHE CAN'T DRAW IN THE THE 
WHAT'S THAT 
ELEPHANT 
O. K. WHAT ABOUT UM AN OSTRICH 
IS IT A CHICKEN 
ASK HER IS IT A CHICKEN 
WHAT'S IT CALLED OSTRICH DONGO 
OMPO OMPO OMPO WITH A LONG NECK O. K. 
OMPO GOOD WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE 
I'VE GOT IT DID SHE EVER SEE THIS WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE 
RHINO DID SHE SEE THAT AS A CHILD 
IT'S JUST AMAZING TO THINK WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HERE BEFORE THE WAR 
RHINO ELEPHANT OSTRICH KUDU ORYX EVERYTHING 
EITHER BEEN KILLED OR JUST HAD MOVED AWAY INTO OTHER AREAS COS OF HUMAN PRESSURE 
OUR SEARCH LEADS US WESTWARD INTO THE DRY COUNTRY 
THREE FULL DAYS OF DRIVING AND STILL NO SIGN OF WILDLIFE 
ANIMALS AND ANGOLA DON'T SEEM TO GO TOGETHER UNLESS THEY'RE DOMESTIC 
BUT WE HAVE NOW LEFT THE LAST OF THE VILLAGES 
AND WE'VE SORT OF MOVED INTO THAT NO MAN'S LAND IN BETWEEN PEOPLE 
AND THE DESERT NEAR THE COAST 
APPARENTLY THIS IS WHERE THERE ARE SOME ANIMALS SO I'M KEEPING MY EYES SHARP 
THIS IS THE FIRST REALLY NICE GROUP OF SPRINGBOK WE'VE SEEN AND IT'S JUST SO CLEAR TO ME THE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE AND THE ABUNDANCE OF WILDLIFE 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRASS YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S NOT MUCH LIVESTOCK 
THAT COMES DOWN HERE SO THERE'S LESS COMPETITION BUT STILL SPRINGBOK 
ARE PRETTY HARDY ANIMALS AND THIS IS JUST THE KIND OF ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY LIKE 
THERE'S DEFINITELY A DISTANCE AT WHICH THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE FROM ME 
BUT THEY'RE PRETTY RELAXED JUST GROOMING AND EATING 
THERE'S A MALE WHO'S KEEPING GUARD ON THE OUTSIDE BUT ON THE WHOLE THEY SEEM TOTALLY UNBOTHERED BY ME 
IT'S JUST SO WONDERFUL TO SEE SOME WILDLIFE AT LAST 
THE FURTHER WEST WE GO THE DRIER IT SEEMS TO GET 
WAR OR NO WAR IT'S ASTOUNDING TO ME THAT ANY ANIMALS CAN SURVIVE OUT HERE AT ALL 
IT'S A ONE HUNDRED MILE DRIVE THROUGH THE DESERT SANDS BEFORE WE REACH THE NEXT SIGNS OF CIVILISATION 
THIS WAS ONCE A THRIVING FISHING VILLAGE 
AT THE MOUTH OF THE CUNENE RIVER 
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THERE WERE EVEN ELEPHANTS HERE 
BUT EVERYTHING'S BEEN DECIMATED BY THE WAR 
BUT WHERE THE FRESHWATER MEETS THE SEA I'M HOPING TO SEE SOME LIFE 
WHILST THE WAR DEVASTATED THE MAINLAND RATHER IRONICALLY THE SEA WAS PROTECTED 
WE HAVE BEEN TRAVELLING THROUGH THE MOST EPIC COUNTRY TO GET DOWN HERE AND NOW WE'VE FINALLY MADE IT TO 
THE MOUTH OF THE CUNENE RIVER AND THE ATLANTIC OCEAN 
BUT THIS IS REALLY JUST THE BEGINNING OF OUR JOURNEY BECAUSE NOW 
WE HEAD NORTH UP ALONG THE BEACH RIGHT INTO THE HEART OF ANGOLA 
WOO LOOK AT ALL THESE BIRDS 
THIS IS JUST BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT 
WHERE YOU GOING 
HAH I DON'T KNOW I'M JUST HEADING NORTH 
THIS IS THE BEST DAY SO FAR 
WHOOO HOOO 
IN THESE MAD LANDSCAPES A QUAD BIKE CAN TAKE ME PLACES THE OTHER VEHICLES JUST CAN'T GET TO 
MUCH LESS ACCESSIBLE COUNTRY ON THE SEARCH FOR JACKALS 
ACCORDING TO NED THIS CANYON CUTS THROUGH WHAT WAS ONCE AN ANCIENT SEABED 
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE 
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THIS PLACE USED TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN BUT NED CAN PROVE IT 
WHAT YOU LOOKING FOR SHARK TEETH 
A SHARK TOOTH 
NOT NOT A FISH TOOTH 
NO JUST SHARK LOOK AT THAT 
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE HERE 
WHAT 
OH ANOTHER TOOTH HERE 
JUST EVERYWHERE THERE MIGHT NOT BE MUCH LIFE AROUND HERE NOW BUT 
MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO IT WAS TEEMING WITH LIFE UNDER THE SEA 
BUT WE HAVEN'T COME HERE TO SEE FOSSILS 
WHAT LIVES HERE NOW 
THERE IS A FEMALE 
REALLY DO YOU THINK THERE'S THAT'S A FEMALE WITH TWO PUPS 
WELL THEY CERTAINLY ALL SEEM TO KNOW EACH OTHER VERY WELL 
IT'S JUST AMAZING TO SEE JACKALS OUT HERE WHEN THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE AT ALL 
THEY'LL EAT ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING THEY CAN FIND WHETHER IT'S 
AN INSECT OR CARRION THAT THEY PICK UP ALONG THE BEACH 
LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING AFTER SOME KIND OF GRUBS RIGHT NOW 
THEY OBVIOUSLY RECOGNISE THAT JACKAL COMING IN 
IT'S NOT POSING ANY KIND OF THREAT JUST GETTING DOWN INTO A SUBMISSIVE GESTURE 
THEY'RE ALL COMING TO GREET HER 
SEEING WILDLIFE IS LOT MORE A SUBTLE AN EXPERIENCE HERE THAN IT IS ELSEWHERE IN AFRICA 
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE VERY PATIENT 
AND WAIT FOR THEM TO COME OUT 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET THROUGH THIS PART OF THE DESERT IS ON THE BEACH 
AND THE BEACH IS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES LONG 
WE'RE HEADING FOR AN ABANDONED ISLAND ABOUT SIX MILES OFF SHORE 
NED TELLS ME IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO FIND SEA BIRDS 
IT'S GONNA TAKE US QUITE A WHILE TO GET OUT THERE BUT IT'S PRETTY DAMN EXCITING 
WE'VE GOT THE WHOLE CREW ONBOARD THE BOAT THEY'RE REALLY WALLOWING IN THE WATER 
BUT HOPEFULLY WE'LL MAKE IT ACROSS 
WHAT STARTS OUT AS FUN SOON STARTS TO GET A BIT HAIRY 
I FOR ONE AM HANGING ON FOR DEAR LIFE 
I FEEL A BIT LIKE A COWBOY WALKING INTO SOME OLD WILD WEST TOWN 
I'M GONNA CLEAN UP THIS PLACE 
SURROUNDED BY EXCEPTIONALLY RICH MARINE LIFE THE TOWN OF TIGRES 
ONCE HAD A BOOMING FISHING INDUSTRY 
LOOK THERE'S EVEN BULLET HOLES HERE IN THE CHURCH 
BUT IT WASN'T THE WAR THAT TURNED THIS PLACE INTO A GHOST TOWN 
TIGRES USED TO BE ATTACHED TO THE MAINLAND UNTIL 
VIOLENT ATLANTIC STORMS WASHED ITS PENINSULA AWAY TURNING IT INTO AN ISLAND OVERNIGHT 
SO WHERE ARE THE BIRDS WE GO THERE TO JETTY TO SEE THE BIRDS 
RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE ON THE OTHER SIDE 
DO YOU NORMALLY SEE MORE BIRDS THAN THIS 
YES WE SEE IN THE MORNING EARLY IN THE MORNING WE CAN SEE THE BIRDS BECAUSE NO WINDS 
NO WIND AND THE BIRDS IS HERE 
HA WE KEEP ON GET GETTING CAUGHT OUT BY THIS WIND 
BUT TO COME NORTH WE'VE HAD TO DRIVE ALONG THE BEACHES AND THE ONLY TIME WE COULD DO THAT WAS AT LOW TIDE 
WHICH WAS THIS MORNING SO WE MISSED OUT ON OUR BIRDS BUT STILL THERE'S QUITE A FEW AROUND HERE 
WE'VE GOT SOME CORMORANTS NESTING OUT ON WHAT REMAINS OF THE JETTY AND A FEW FLAMINGOS OUT AT SEA 
THE WIND'S REALLY PICKED UP AND WE'VE LEFT IT LATE TO GET BACK TO THE MAINLAND 
I FEEL WE'RE PUSHING THE ENVELOPE 
AND I'VE BEEN DREADING THIS CROSSING 
THE MEN CONVERSE 
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO GUYS 
DON'T LET GO OF THAT WHATEVER YOU DO GET SOME ROPE 
WHAT'S HAPPENING 
WELL WE'VE RUN OUT OF FUEL AND WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM SHORE 
AND WE'RE PRETTY ACTUALLY 
BECAUSE THE CURRENT IS TAKING US OUT TO SEA 
ARE WE GOING FORWARDS HERE 
IF WE CAN JUST KEEP THIS REALLY STRONG THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
WE'RE PROBABLY ABOUT THREE NAUTICAL MILES FROM THE SHORE THE SUN IS SETTING 
AND THERE'S A STRONG CURRENT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BLOW US OUT TO SEA 
AND WE ARE USING WHAT WE'VE GOT TO TRY AND GET BACK TO LAND 
OUT HERE THERE'S NOBODY WHO CAN COME AND HELP US 
EVEN IF THEY KNEW WHERE WE WERE IT WOULD TAKE THEM DAYS TO GET TO US SO WE HAVE TO GET TO SHORE TONIGHT 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT FUNNY THIS FEELING INSIDE 
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO CAN EASILY HIDE 
AS NIGHT FALLS WE SING TO KEEP UP OUR SPIRITS 
EACH OF US THINKING OF THOSE WE'VE LEFT AT HOME 
I FEEL LIKE ONE OF MY NINE LIVES IS FLOATING OUT TO SEA 
COME GIVE ME THE CAMERA GIVE ME THE CAMERA 
ONCE WE HIT THE SURF WE KNOW WE'VE MADE IT 
HERE GOES HERE GOES ONE TWO THREE 
WHOO HOO WE'RE HERE WE'RE HERE 
ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE COAST OF ANGOLA EVERYTHING CHANGES 
I CAN FEEL THE CLIMATE'S A LOT MORE TROPICAL AND HUMID IT'S A WHOLE NEW 
ECO ZONE SO I'M HOPING TO SEE A DIFFERENT RANGE OF ANIMALS 
THE MAIN HIGHWAY TAKES US THREE HUNDRED MILES UP NORTH AT AN AVERAGE SPEED OF TEN MILES AN HOUR 
THERE'S LOADS OF IVORY FOR SALE HERE 
LOOK AT ALL THE TOURISTS PEOPLE HERE BUYING IT 
GOD POOR ELEPHANTS MY GOD 
AND WHAT'S SO SAD IS TO SEE THAT THE WAR WAS APPALLING FOR THE WILDLIFE IN IS THIS COUNTRY 
AND PEACE TIME ISN'T PROVING TO BE THAT MUCH EASIER EITHER 
NED CAN YOU ASK HIM WHERE WHERE DOES ALL THIS IVORY COME FROM 
FROM WHERE FROM HERE I THOUGHT THERE WEREN'T ANY ELEPHANTS IN ANGOLA 
MUCH OF THIS IVORY HAS A PINKISH TINGE TO IT 
WHICH MEANS THAT IT COMES FROM FOREST ELEPHANTS IN THE CONGO BASIN 
WHAT I FIND SO DEPRESSING FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
WITH SOME OF THESE GUYS HERE IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING THIS IVORY 
ARE EUROPEANS AMERICANS CHINESE WHO ARE DOWN HERE PORTUGUESE 
AND THEY REALLY SHOULD KNOW BETTER 
ONE OF THE MOST ENDANGERED MAMMALS IN AFRICA LIVES HERE IN THE KWANZA RIVER 
IT'S THE FRESHWATER MANATEE AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE IN MY LIFE 
SO WE'RE TAKING AN EARLY MORNING FLOAT DOWN THE RIVER 
DRIFTING DOWN TOWARDS THE MOUTH JUST TO SEE IF BY CHANCE AND GREAT LUCK WE HAPPEN TO COME ACROSS ONE 
THESE CREATURES ARE SO SHY BECAUSE THEY GET HUNTED THAT THEY OFTEN JUST PUT THEIR NOSTRILS ABOVE THE WATER 
TO TAKE A BREATH AND THEN DISAPPEAR AGAIN SO IF WE ACTUALLY SEE IT WE'RE GONNA BE INCREDIBLY LUCKY 
THERE'S SOMETHING RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BOAT YOU CAN SEE THE BUBBLES 
IT'S GONNA COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE 
IT'S OUT THERE IT'S OUT THERE 
WELL A MANATEE HAS JUST SWUM UNDER THE BOAT BUT ALL WE COULD SEE WAS 
A STREAM OF BUBBLES SO WE GOT THIS CLOSE 
JUST SHOWS HOW SECRETIVE THEY ARE 
I SUPPOSE IN THE LONG RUN THAT IS THE BEST THING THAT THEY JUST KEEP THEMSELVES OUT OF SIGHT 
AT LEAST THAT'S GOING TO ENSURE THEIR SURVIVAL 
HERE ON THE KWANZA RIVER I'VE HAD MY FIRST REAL TASTE OF WHAT THE WILD AREAS OF ANGOLA COULD BE LIKE 
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL AND PEACEFUL JUST FLOATING DOWN THIS RIVER AT THE SAME PACE AS THE CURRENT 
AT LAST WE'VE REACHED ANGOLA'S CAPITAL CITY LUANDA WHERE OUR JOURNEY ENDS 
AMAZINGLY THIS IS WHERE WE MAY HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF SEEING WILDLIFE 
ON THE CITY'S OUTSKIRTS IS KISSAMA NATIONAL PARK 
AND ROLAND GOETZ IS THE PARK'S HEAD WARDEN 
I'LL JUST OPEN THIS DOOR THAT'S QUITE A PILE OF WEAPONRY YOU'VE GOT IN THERE 
THESE ARE ALL WEAPONS THAT HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED FROM POACHERS 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS 
IS THAT AN R. P. G. 
YES IT HAS A. 
YIKES THAT LOOKS TERRIFYING 
THERE IT IS THERE BUT HAVE A LOOK DON'T I HAVEN'T PUT THE BOLT ON 
OH SO A ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADE AND THIS IS WHAT YOU CARRY AROUND WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO ON PATROL 
IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CARRY TO INTIMIDATE 
UH IT IS PRETTY DAMN INTIMIDATING I WOULDN'T LIKE TO MEET YOU WITH THIS 
JUST JUST PASS IT TO PINTO AND ALSO THIS 
OH MY GOD THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF RAMBO 
IT'S A PKM MACHINE GUN THIS WE USE QUITE A LOT 
YOU'RE WALKING THROUGH THE BUSH WITH THESE SORTS OF WEAPONS 
AND THE GUY WITH AN A. K. IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL ABOUT TRYING TO TAKE YOU ON 
SO THE WAR'S NOT OVER YET WELL I SUPPOSE IT IS BUT WE'VE GOT A DIFFERENT TYPE OF WAR NOW 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS IN KISSAMA NATIONAL PARK WERE KILLED DURING THE WAR 
THE NEW THREAT IS FROM POACHERS 
KISSAMA IS TEN THOUSAND SQUARE KILOMETRES THAT'S CORRECT YES 
HOW MANY MEN DO YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY MONITOR WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON 
WELL AT THE MOMENT 
I HAVE FOURTEEN PEOPLE AND ME 
FOURTEEN PEOPLE FIFTEEN PEOPLE OVER TEN THOUSAND SQUARE KILOMETRES 
I WOULD SAY THAT'S BEING SPREAD A LITTLE THIN ISN'T IT 
WHAT WAS KISSAMA LIKE BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN PHENOMENAL AND JUST FULL OF ANIMALS 
THESE FLOODPLAINS WERE JUST COVERED WITH BUFFALO THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF ROAN ANTELOPE 
IN ANY PARK IN AFRICA AND ELAND I MEAN HERDS OF HUNDREDS 
ROLAND'S DREAM IS TO RE ESTABLISH THE WILDLIFE POPULATIONS HERE BUT HE KNOWS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY 
YOU SEE THE THING IS THAT A COUNTRY THAT'S BEEN IN A IN A CIVIL WAR FOR THIRTY YEARS 
IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE FOR PEOPLE JUST TO LIVE NORMAL LIVES NEVER MIND WORRY 
ABOUT THE NATIONAL PARKS WE'VE ONLY BEEN OUT OF THE CIVIL WAR FIVE YEARS NOW 
AS THINGS BECOME MORE NORMAL IT'S ALL POSSIBLE 
THERE'S TWO ELEPHANTS DOWN IN THE SWAMP YOU CAN HARDLY SEE THEM 
JUST THE TOPS OF THEIR BACKS POKING UP ABOVE ALL THE REEDS 
BUT THESE ELEPHANTS WEREN'T BORN HERE THEY'VE BEEN BROUGHT IN 
FROM SOUTHERN AFRICA TO HELP RESTOCK THE PARK DO YOU SEE THEM THERE OH GREAT YES 
WELL AFTER ALL THESE LONG DAYS IN THE DESERT SEEING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
IT'S JUST MAGICAL SEEING ELEPHANTS AGAIN WELL I AM VERY VERY PLEASED THAT WE ACTUALLY SAW THEM 
WHAT'S THE CHANCES WE SEE THEM FAIRLY OFTEN ESPECIALLY IN THIS AREA 
HE'S SAYING YOU HAVE TO TURN AROUND AND FILM THE ELEPHANTS NOT US 
FOR YOU THIS MUST BE A GREAT SYMBOL OF HOPE 
WELL IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S A MIRACLE 
ALL THE ANIMALS IN THIS PARK ALL THE LARGE ANIMALS WERE KILLED 
NOT MANY CONSERVATIONISTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THEIR LIFETIME 
OF THE CHALLENGES THE ISSUES WE FACE HERE TO RE ESTABLISH A NATIONAL PARK 
ONE OF THE FINEST IN AFRICA THE POTENTIAL OF BEING IT CERTAINLY WAS ONE OF THE FINEST 
I'VE BEEN GREATLY SURPRISED BY ANGOLA 
THIS WAR TORN COUNTRY THAT'S FINALLY RISING LIKE A PHOENIX OUT OF THE ASHES 
AND YET IT HAS THIS QUALITY OF INNOCENCE ABOUT IT THAT I REMEMBER OF THE AFRICA I KNEW AS A CHILD 
AND WE'VE HAD THE MOST EPIC JOURNEY THROUGH THIS INCREDIBLE WILDERNESS 
BUT WE'VE HAD TO WORK TERRIBLY HARD TO FIND ANY WILDLIFE AND I SUPPOSE AT THE END OF IT ALL 
MY FEELING IS THAT 
THERE'S JUST ENOUGH WILDLIFE HERE TO REBOUND 
AND IF IT CAN JUST BE GIVEN THAT CHANCE ANGOLA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO BECOME ONE OF THE GREATEST WILDLIFE DESTINATIONS IN AFRICA 
THESE ARE NO ORDINARY KIDS 
THEY'RE SUPERKIDS GENETICALLY DESIGNED TO BEAT ADULTS 
JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN I'VE GOT QUITE A LOT STORED UP HERE 
I'M TWENTY SIX HE'S THIRTEEN SO ACCORDING TO ME HE'S HALF AS INTELLIGENT 
YOU WANNA FIND OUT WHO WINS 
JOIN US AND SEE IF THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT
