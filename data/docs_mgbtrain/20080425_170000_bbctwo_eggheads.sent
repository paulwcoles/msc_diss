SINCE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY DANDELION ROOTS HAVE BEEN ROASTED 
AND GROUND TO PRODUCE A SUBSTITUTE FOR WHICH DRINK 
O. K. I DON'T KNOW THIS IMMEDIATELY 
I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK WHY YOU WOULD NEED A SUBSTITUTE 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF LEMONS SO I CAN'T SEE 
WHY YOU WOULD NEED A SUBSTITUTE TO CREATE LEMONADE 
THE WORD ROASTED COULD FEATURE IN BEER OR COFFEE 
SO I'M GOING TO HAZARD A GUESS BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM 
BEER 
IT'S COFFEE 
ROASTED AND GROUND TO PRODUCE A SUBSTITUTE FOR COFFEE 
ON THE RIGHT TRACK IN TERMS OF SHORTAGES 
COFFEE PRESUMABLY WAS A VERY PRECIOUS COMMODITY 
WELL IN THE WAR THERE WAS SHORTAGES OF LEMONS 
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T GROWN HERE AND CERTAINLY COFFEE 
BUT I IMAGINE BEER WAS 
I MEAN ALL THE INGREDIENTS FOR BEER WERE GROWN HERE 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN DISGUSTING DANDELION COFFEE 
IT WAS I THINK REVOLTING THEY MADE IT OUT OF CHICORY TOO 
YES YES CHICORY 
NOT THE ANSWER WE WERE LOOKING FOR NOT BEER COFFEE 
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE TIBETAN DOG BREED 
THAT IS SAID TO HAVE ORIGINALLY BEEN A CROSS

IS IN WINCHESTER WHERE I STUDY 
AHA BEEN TO IT CLEARLY 
I HAVE YES SO THAT LEAVES THE LARGEST OR THE HIGHEST 
WHERE DID YOU SAY IT WAS SORRY 
IT'S CALLED THE TAN HILL INN 
AND IT'S IN ARKENGARTHDALE IN NORTH YORKSHIRE 
MY GUESS WOULD BE THE LARGEST 
POSSIBLY 
TAKE YOUR TIME THE TAN HILL INN 
I KNOW THE LONGEST BAR IN BRITAIN IS IN TAUNTON 
YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH IS THIS PERSONAL RESEARCH 
I'M GOING TO CHANGE MY MIND AND GO FOR THE HIGHEST 
WHY HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND

WE'VE HAD BEER HIGHEST PUB AND NEWT 
YES I'VE GOT IT SEE THE LINKS YES 
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT ANSWER JACK IT'S NOT NEWT IT IS EGGHEADS 
FROG IT'S A FROG AFTER A HORSE'S HOOF 
AH O. K. BECAUSE THE INDENTATION 
THE HORSE HAS A FROG IN ITS HOOF THAT YOU HAVE TO CLEAN OUT 
THE INDENTATION IN A HORSE IS A FROG 
SO THEY'VE TRANSFERRED THAT TO THE HOUSE BRICK AS WELL 
I IMAGINE I MEAN I SLIGHTLY INVENTED THAT 
BUT I THINK THAT'S RIGHT PROBABLY THE DERIVATION 
O. K. THE INDENTATION IN A HOUSE BRICK IS A FROG
