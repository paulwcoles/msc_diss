HELLO WELCOME TONIGHT A MAN WHO 
HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN EVERYTHING 
FROM JAMES BOND TO FRANZ 
KAFKA WELCOME TO STEVEN BERKOFF 
HOW ARE YOU 
VERY WELL 
YOU HAVE 
NOT SEEN THE SHOW BEFORE IS THAT 
THE CORRECT 
I HAVEN'T HAD 
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IT BECAUSE I 
HADN'T PAID MY T. V. LICENCE AND MY 
TELEVISION WAS TAKEN A AWAY AND 
I'M SAVING UP AND HOPING TO SEE IT 
AGAIN I'M PROUD TO BE HERE THAT THAT IS AN EXCELLENT BIT OF IMPRRV 
IMPROV WHO IS GYLES LOOKING AT IT 
IS MIKE DILGER OUR BIRD MAN LET'S 
GO BACK TO THE GANG LANDS OF THE 
SIXTIES THE NAMES REGGIE AND RONNIE 
HAVE A FRIENDLY ENOUGH RING TO THEM 
BUT IF YOU GOT ON THE WRONG SIDE 
THEY WOULD MAKE YOU WISH YOU HADN'T 
THE LAW CAUGHT UP WITH THEM FORTY 
YEARS AGO IN 
NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHEN THEY 
WERE ARRESTED MORE THE MURDERS OF 
JACK THE HAT MCVITIE AND GEORGE 
CORNELL WE SENT DOM LITTLEWOOD TO 
LOOK INTO THE REAL WORLD THERE HAS 
BEEN A RECENT TREND OF GLAMOURISING 
GANGLAND CULTURE WE SEE IT IN OUR 
FILMS AND THE PRESS L. KNOW I MAY 
LOOK LIKE A VILLAIN LET ME ASSURE 
YOU I HAVE NEVER BEEN ONE BUT I'M 
OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER TWO OF THE 
MOST NOTORIOUS CRIMINALS IN OUR 
HISTORY TIMES WERE CHANGING AND WE 
HAD THE BEATLES AND OLD MONEY BUT 
WE ALSO HAD THE KRAY TWINS WHO 
WENT ON TO RULE GANGLAND LONG 
LONDON THE CRAZE WERE GSH KRAYS 
WERE BORN IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AND EVEN THOUGH 
THEY ARE NO ROBIN HOOD THEY BECOME 
SOMEWHAT MYTHICAL EVEN AFTER FOUR 
DECADES OF IMPRISONMENT 
SURPRISINGLY SOME PEOPLE LOOK BACK 
ON THEIR REIGN OF TERROR WITH A 
SENSE OF NOSTALGIA PERHAPS IT WAS 
BECAUSE OF THEIR CELEBRITY STATUS 
THEY THRIVED ON THEIR NOTORIETY IT 
WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING 
SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR JOB BEING IN 
THE PAPERS WITH THE CELEBRITIES AS AS TEENAGERS THEY TOOK UP AMATEUR 
BOXING HERE IN BETHNAL GREEN AND 
REGULARY TURN PROFESSIONAL BY THE 
TIME HE WAS TWENTY EIGHT HOWEVER SOON AFTER 
TIME HE WAS TWENTY EIGHT HOWEVER SOON AFTER SHE GOT INVOLVED IN HIJACKING AND 
ARMED ROBBERY THEY HEADED LONDON 
CRIME BY REPUTATION RESPECT AND 
RETALIATION 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO RETALIATION SOMETHING BAD OBVIOUSLY AND THEN 
YOU HAVE TO GO YEAH THAT'S THE 
RULES IF YOU DON'T OBEY THEM RULES 
THAT'S IT 
RON ALSO SUFFERED FROM 
PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA WITH 
SOMETIMES VIOLENT MOOD SWINGS 
RONNIE WAS JUST SPOOKY COW SEE HE 
WAS THE POWERHOUSE BEHIND THE PAIR 
OF THEM HE WAS DEFINITELY THE ONE 
TO LISTEN TO 
THINGS WERE TO GET A 
LONG WORSE T. WAS IN THIS PUB IN 
WHITECHAPEL IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX THAT RONNIE 
KRAY SHOT AND KILLED GEORGE CORNELL 
THEY BELIEVED THEIR OWN HYPE SO 
MUCH THAT IN THE END HE WALKED INTO 
A CROWDED PUB AND SHOT SOMEONE IN 
FRONT OF EVERYONE AND TRULY 
BELIEVED HE WOULD GET AWAY WITH IT 
THAT IS WHERE HE WAS WRONG THERE 
GEORGE HAD DONE NOTHING WRONG THAT 
WAS A TRAGEDY 
IN OCTOBER NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN AT 
THIS FLAT IN STOKE NEWINGTON REGGIE 
KRAY REGULARY REGGIE KRAY 
VIOLENTLY MURDERED A MEMBER OF 
THEIR OWN GANG JACK THE HAT 
MCVITIE NOT LONG AFTER THE 
BROTHERS WERE ARRESTED BOTH WERE 
SENTENCED TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT 
WITH A MINIMUM OF THIRTY YEARS 
I MET 
RON AND REG IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND THE TWINS 
THAT I MET WERE NOTHING LIKE THE 
TWINS WHOSE REPUTATION WAS OF 
FIERCESOME GANGSTERS THEIR VOICES 
ARE WEAK AND INFECTUAL NOTHING 
LIKE YOU WOULD EXPECT 
I WALKED IN 
AND HE ISSUED THREATS AGAINST ME 
AND SAID HE WAS GOING TO KILL ME 
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD DO HIM FIRST 
BEST WAY AIN'T IT 
HE SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN TREATED IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT FOR MENTAL 
ILLNESS IF HE HAD BEEN THE MURDERS 
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED 
THE TWINS 
HAVE NOW SINCE PASSED AWAY IN COME 
SPAR SON TO THE MAFIA THE CRIMINAL 
EMPIRE THEY CREATED WAS MORE AKIN 
TO A RAUCOUS BUNCH OF LAD THE LADS 
THAN EVIL ORGANISED CRIME CARTELS 
THE SHEER FAME KEPT THEM IN ALL 
THAT TIME 
IF THE GENERAL PUBLIC 
HAD MET THE CHARACTERS AT THE END 
THE MYTH WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS BIG 
SO THEY ACTUALLY KEPT THE MYTH 
GOING BY KEEPING THEM WHERE THEY 
WERE 
THE BROTHERS SHOULD NOT BE WERE REMEMBERS AS OUTLAWS BUT WHAT THEY 
WERE CRIMINALS 
IT'S NOT ROMANTIC 
THERE IS NOTHING GLAMOROUS APART 
FROM ON THE BIG SCREEN AND IN BOOKS 
THAT WELL KNOWN COMMENTATOR ON 
ORGANISED CRIME GYLES BRANDRETH 
JOINS US NOW WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 
THEM DO YOU HAVE ANY FONDNESS NO NO BUT I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DID 
HAVE WHAT THEY HAD WAS MONEY THEY 
BROUGHT A KIND OF LAS VEGAS GLAMOUR 
TO SEW SHOW IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES 
THEY HAD MONEY AND DRUGS AND WOMEN 
PEOPLE USED TO SAY I REMEMBER 
BEING OUTSIDE THE PUB WITH ONE OF 
THEIR PALS AND HER SAYING TO ME 
GYLES THEY ONLY EVER KILL THEIR 
OWN THERE WAS SOMETHING GLAMOROUS 
ABOUT IT 
THEY RUBBED SHOULDERS 
WITH THE BEST OF THEM 
LORD BOOTHBY 
WHOM I MET TOLD ME THAT KNOWING 
THEM WAS LIKE FEASTING WITH 
PANTHERS THE DANGER WAS PART OF IT 
HE OUGHT TO 
KNOW BETTER HE DIDN'T KNOW BETTER HE OUGHT TO THE TRUTH 
IS IT IS DANGEROUS TO GLAMOURISE 
THE PEOPLE BUT WE DO AND GET SOME 
OF THE GREAT ACTORS OF THE WORLD TO 
PLAY THEM AND MAKE THEM SEEM LIKE 
BIG MEN AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY 
LITTLE MEN WITH SMALL VOICES BUT 
WE GET THE STEPHEN'S OF THIS WORLD 
TO GIVE THEM THAT AUTHORITY LITTLE LITTLE MEN WITH SMALL VOICES THAT IS NOT 
GYLES HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT 
PLAYING THEM IS IT ENJOYABLE TO 
PLAY 
VILLAINS ARE ALWAYS ENJOYABLE PLAY BECAUSE USUALLY IN A FILM THEY ARE 
THE MOST INTELLIGENT BECAUSE THEY 
ARE PLAYING TWO SIDES THEY HAVE TO 
PLAY ONE SIDE WHERE THEY APPEAR TO 
BE STRAIGHT AND AVOID THE POLICE 
AND THE OTHER SIDE IS THEIR DEMON 
SIDE WHEREAS THE STRAIGHT GUY YOU 
KNOW WHO HE IS FOR THE VILLAIN YOU 
ARE ALWAYS FULFILLING SOME BASIC 
DESIRE AND NEED IN THE PUBLIC 
BECAUSE INSIDE THE PUBLIC LIKE ALL 
OF US WE ARE FAIRLY RESPECTABLE 
SAFE LAW ABIDING PEOPLE BUT BY 
BEING SO WE CURTAIL A GREAT DEAL OF 
PERHAPS PASSION SOME ANARCHY 
WITHIN US L. THINK THERE IS IN OUR 
PAST A GREATER DEAL OF ADVENTURE 
SO WHAT THE VILLAIN DOES 
VICARIOUSLY IS HE GIVES US A CHANCE 
TO IDENTIFY THAT FORM OF 
IDENTIFICATION IS A FORM OF RELEASE 
SO WHEN WE SEE THEM WE CHANGE 
THERE CAN BE A GRADUAL CHANGE EVEN 
WATCHING THE MOVIE AS WE STRAUT OUT 
STRUT OUT 
YOUR CHARACTER GET 
SLOTTED IN THE END SO YOU CAN'T GO 
ON 
UNFORTUNATELY HE DOES L. ON DISAGREE WITH YOU IN A WAY SAYING 
WE SHOULDN'T GLAMORISE THEM YOU 
CANNOT GLAMORISE THEM ENOUGH 
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN A WAY OF LOOK 
THE HEROES OF SOCIETY WE NEED THEM 
OF COURSE THEY ARE PSYCHOTICS AND 
THEY ARE MAD BUT IN A WAY THOSE 
ARE THE PEOPLE 
WE DON'T NEED THEM 
WE DON'T NEED THEM IN THAT WAY OF 
WE DON'T MIND YOU PLAYING THEM ON 
THE SCREEN BUT TO GET INVOLVED WITH 
THEM 
YOU HAVE TAKEN TO DIRECTING THEM AGAIN WITH YOUR LATE ER LATEST 
VENTURE ON THE WATERFRONT YOU ARE 
PUTTING IT ON A STAGE IN 
NOTTINGHAM 
IT'S 
A GREAT STORY AND NOTTINGHAM A GREAT STORY WILL TRANSFER TO 
ANOTHER MEDIUM IF YOU HAVE THE WAY 
WITH THE WHEREWITHAL AND THE 
MEANS AND IF YOU LIKE THE KEY TO 
OPEN UP THAT PARTICULAR WORK L. 
THINK I WANTED TO I SAW THE 
SCRIPT ONE DAY IN SOMEONE'S OFFICE 
THE PLAY SCRIPT AND I THOUGHT THIS 
IS AMAZING L. WAS AT THE NATIONAL 
THEATRE AND I SAW THE SCRIPT ON THE 
DESK I SAID THIS IS FANTASTIC 
THEY ARE GOING TO DO THIS AT THE 
NATIONAL WHAT A BRILLIANT IDEA 
HOW INNOVATIVE NOW THEY WILL GET 
CROWDS AND THE YOUNG SO I 
MENTIONED THIS AND HE SAID IT'S NOT 
FOR US HE DOESN'T APPROVE PERHAPS 
OF FILMS BEING ADAPTED TO STAGE HE 
WANTED PURE WRITING AND I CAN 
UNDERSTAND THAT SO I MADE A LITTLE 
BIT OF INVESTIGATION AND GOT THE 
RIGHTS I DECIDED TO STAGE IT IT IT LOOKS FANTASTIC WE CAN SEE THE 
SCENE THAT EVERYONE WILL REMEMBER 
NOW FROM ON THE WATERFRONT THE 
FILM WITH MARLON BRANDO HERE THEY 
ARE IN REHERSAL 
I COULD HAVE HAD 
CLASS I COULD HAVE BEEN A 
CONTENDER I COULD HAVE BEEN 
SOMEBODY INSTEAD OF A BUM WHICH 
IS WHAT I AM OH YES I AM CHARLIE 
I'M A BUM 
WHEN DOES THAT OPEN AT 
NOTTINGHAM PLAYHOUSE 
HE'S BEEN ON 
FOR THREE WEEKS AND IT'S COMING TO 
THE END OF ITS STAY AT NOTTINGHAM 
WHICH IS A GREAT SADNESS BECAUSE 
WE ALL LOVE NOTTINGHAM WE HOPE IT 
WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE WEST END 
SO WE HAVE TWO OR THREE THEATRES 
LINED UP IT WILL BE SEEN IF LONDON 
WITHOUT QUESTION WITHIN THE NEXT 
MONTH 
WE CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO MONTH SEEING THAT FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS

MUSEUM IS GOING TO TAKE A SEAT HERE 
GET THIS BOOK OUT AND TELL US WHAT 
IT IS 
I HAVE TWO LITTLE BROOKS THESE ARE 
THE EARLIEST BOOKS BY CHARLOTTE 
BRONTE 
HOW OLD WAS SHE 
SHE WOULD BRONTE HAVE BEEN THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE 
THIS IS 
AT THE PARSONAGE IT IS LIKE A 
MINIATURE NEWSPAPER 
IT IS THEY 
CREATED A FAN FANTASY WORLD AND 
THEY WROTE DOWN THE DOINGS IN THESE 
TINY BOOKS WHICH WERE DESIGNED TO 
BE SMALL ENOUGH FOR THE SOLDIERS TO 
READ 
OVER THE BANK HOLIDAY WEEKEND READ WE CAN ALL GO AND SEE THESE 
BECAUSE THEY ARE AT THE MUSEUM 
YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN VISIT HATHERSAGE AND CAN EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR THE MUSEUM IS 
OPEN 
FANTASTIC THANKS VERY MUCH OPEN THEY ARE INCREDIBLE TO THINK THEIR 
HANDS PUT THOSE TOGETHER THEY THEY CREATED THIS WHOLE WORLD INSIDE 
THEIR HEADS JUST AMAZING STILL 
SINGING TO US ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS LATER 
IN A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS WE ARE GOING TO BE 
HEARING A LOT MORE ABOUT BOOKS 
PARTICULARLY THE ONES NOMINATED FOR 
THE MANN BOOKER PRIZE WE ARE 
LOOKING FOR SIX VIEWERS TO READ THE 
SHORTLISTED BOOKS IF YOU ARE UP 
FOR A READ DROP US A LINE 
WE ARE ENCOURAGING YOU TO GET UP 
BRIGHT AND EARLY TO CELEBRATE 
INTERNATIONAL DAWN CHORUS DAY AS 
IT TURNS OUT LIKE ALL MEMBERS OF 
THE MALE SPECIES THEY CAN'T RESIST 
SHOWING OFF MIKE DILGER SINGS HIS 
ADMIRATION FOR THEM LOUD AND 
PROUD 
ANY PARK OR WOODLAND AT THIS TIME 
OF THE YEAR USE YOUR EARS AND YOU 
WILL HEAR A TALENT SHOWN LINE UP 
THAT EVEN SIMON COWELL WOULD BE 
PROUD OF THE DAWN CHORUS IS ALL 
ABOUT MALE BIRDS DEFENDING THEIR 
TERRITORIES AND TRYING TO IMPRESS 
THE FEMALE WITH THEIR SONGS BUT 
ONLY NOW ARE SCIENTISTS STARTING TO 
UNDERSTAND JUST HOW TALENTED THESE 
BIRDS REALLY ARE SOME SING IN A 
REGIONAL ACCENT OTHERS LIKE TO 
SING AS LONG AND AS LOUD AS THEY 
CAN 
THIS MAN HAS BEEN STUDYING ONE OF 
OUR MOST VOCAL BIRDS FOR MORE THAN 
TWENTY YEARS HE'S DISCOVERED THE BIRDS 
ARE TESTING EACH OTHER WITH THEIR 
SONGS LET'S SEE WHAT THE LOCAL 
TITS ARE GOING TO GET UP TO LET'S LET'S DO THAT 
GO FOR IT 
HERE WE GO 
GREAT TITS HAVE THE 
TERRITORY ABOUT THE SIZE OF A 
FOOTBALL PITCH IF THEY HEAR 
ANOTHER MALE SINGING THEY WILL TRY 
AND OUTSING THEM L. CAN HEAR ONE IN 
THE DISTANCE 
THERE IS ONE OVER THE 
BACK THERE YES 
THAT IS A 
NEIGHBOUR SAYING I'VE HEARD YOU 
I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE 
HE'S COME IN 
REALLY CLOSE 
THAT IS GREAT REALLY 
CLOSE WOW LOOK AT THAT 
NOW HE IS 
REALLY ANNOYED 
HE'S COME IN CLOSER 
LET'S PLAY IT AGAIN 
NOW HE'S HE 
IS LOOKING AROUND 
HE IS HOPPING 
AROUND LIKE A CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF 
GIVE HIM ONE MORE 
THE 
ULTIMATE THREAT IS TO SING OVER 
ANOTHER BIRD'S SONG THIS MEANS 
THEY ARE READY TO FIGHT THAT IS 
LOVELY HE'S CALLING RIGHT OVER THE 
TOP OF YOURS 
HE IS DOING OVERLAP 
IF THERE WERE ANOTHER MALE THERE 
HE SHOULD BE SERIOUSLY WORRIED SO SO THERE IS NO DOUBT WHO RULES THE 
ROOST IN THIS BIT OF WOODLAND 
WHILST MALE GREAT TITS BELT THEIR 
SONGS OUT OTHER BIRDS ARE MORE 
CREATIVE WITH THEIR REPERTORY 
REPERTOIRE IN FACT THEY GIVE RORY 
BREMNER A RUN FOR HIS MONEY LISTEN 
TO THIS THAT IS A STARLING DOING A 
VERY GOOD JOB OF BEING A CHICKEN 
BY COPYING THE SOUNDS THEY HEAR 
AROUND THEM THESE MALE BIRDS ARE 
BASICALLY SHOWING OFF TO THE GIRLS 
PERHAPS THE MOST AMAZING TALENT 
GOES TO A SMALL BROWN BIRD CALLED 
THE CORN BUNTING THESE BIRDS HAVE 
ACCENTS BUT WHILST OURS VARY 
BETWEEN REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY 
THESE BIRDS HAVE DIFFERENT DIALECTS 
OVER A FEW HUNDRED METRES THE THE BIRDS ON THIS HEADLAND ALL SING 
VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL SONGS BUT THE 
BIRDS FROM THAT HEADLAND THEY ALSO 
SING SONGS WHICH ARE IDENTICAL TO 
ONE ANOTHER OVER THERE BUT THEY 
ARE DIFFERENT FROM HERE 
AT NORMAL 
SPEED OUR HUMAN EARS WOULD 
STRUGGLE TO HEAR THE DIFFERENCE 
SLOWED DOWN THE TWO SONGS ARE 
REMARKABLY DISTINCT 
THIS IS THE 
FIRST ONE AND NOW THE HEADLAND 
WHERE WE ARE 
TOTALLY DIFFERENT IT IT IS ALMOST LIKE A POSTCODE DIALECT 
SO DIFFERENT AREAS OF QUITE A SMALL 
TOWN WOULD HAVE PEOPLE SOUNDING 
DIFFERENT IN THIS CASE IT IS CORN 
BUNTINGS SOUNDING DIFFERENT THAT THAT IS SUPERB L. WILL NEVER LISTEN TO A 
DAWN CHORUS THE SAME WAY AGAIN 
WHY WOULD STARLING WANT TO 
IMPERSONATE CHICKEN 
A VERY GOOD 
QUESTION WHY DO BIRDS SING THEY 
SING TO IMPRESS THE LADIES OF 
COURSE THEY ALSO SING TO TELL THE 
MALES TO SLING THEIR HOOK MAYBE MAYBE THE HUMAN RACE SHOULD ADOPT THAT 
WHY IMPERSONATE A CHICKEN 
THEY ARE 
TELLING THE MALES THE FEMALES ARE 
LISTENING TO THEM AND THE FEMALES 
ARE LISTENING TO THE BIRDS SINGING 
AND THE MALES ARE SINGING AND THEY 
ARE TRYING TO COME UP WITH A 
COMPLEX BEAUTIFUL MELODY WHAT THEY 
ARE SAYING IS I'VE GOT A MASSIVE 
TERRITORY I'VE GOT BEAUTIFUL 
WHY NOT PRETEND TO BE GOLDEN EAGLE 
A CHAFFINCH HAS NEVER HEARD EAGLE OF GOLDEN EAGLES 
DO 
THEY TWEET NO NO THEY SING WHEN THEY ARE MATING I I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SO INTERESTED 
THE FEMALES ARE LIKE CHECK OUT 
THAT THE FUNKY CHICKEN 
ARE YOU 
GOING TO TELL ME A BIRD IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND IS GOING TO SOUND MORE LIKE 
A NORTHERN IRISH BIRD 
OF COURSE 
THE BIRDS WILL DO THE SAME THING 
WE HAVE THREE CHAFFINCHES HERE CAN 
WE HEAR IT THIS IS FROM CUMBRIA 
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE THEY SOUND THE 
SAME TO ME 
NO IT DOESN'T 
YES IT 
DOES SOMERSET 
THAT LAST ONE HAD A 
REAL WEST COUNTRY TWANG 
CAN YOU 
NOT HEAR IT 
I'VE GOT FORTY ACRES 
IT IS DIFFERENT IN SPEED WHEN THEY 
COME DOWN SO BASICALLY SOMERSET 
BIRD WILL LISTEN FOR THAT SOMERSET 
CHAFFINCH IT KNOWS IT IS WITH 
LOCAL BIRD IT KNOWS THE AREA IT 
CAN FIND FOOD 
WE HAVE AN E. MAIL 
FROM MERVYN HE SAID WE ARE 
BOMBARDED WITH SIRENS IN THE CITY 
I WAS STRUCK BY THE SHEER NUMBER OF 
SIRENS AND HE REALISED THE SIREN 
SOUND WAS COMING FROM A BLACKBIRD 
IS THAT USUAL CERTAINLY 
THIS IS CERTAINLY FROM LIFE OF BIRDS IT IS CALLED 
THE SUPERB LYREBIRD 
THAT WAS A 
CAMERA SHUTTER NOW A CAMERA WITH A 
MOTOR DRIVE MOTOR DRIVE THAT WAS A CAR ALARM NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST AND BROADCASTER 
MATTHEW PARRIS HAS FOUND WAY OF 
HALVING HIS ENERGY BILL LUCY 
SIEGLE TOOK IT UPON HERSELF TO FIND 
OUT HOW THIS WORKS 
A METRE DOWN UNDERNEATH HERE THE 
SOIL'S TEMPERATURE IS A NEAR 
CONSTANT TEN C. O. K. NOT EXACTLY 
SCORCHING I HEAR YOU SAY BUT 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE HEAT 
CONTAINED IN THIS DERBYSHIRE FIELD 
IS EASILY HOT ENOUGH TO BRING THE 
WATER IN THIS BATHROOM TO A TOASTY 
FIFTY C. SO HOW ON EARTH DOES THIS 
HAPPEN WELL THE ANSWER LIES IN 
THE EARTH ITSELF AND AN AMAZING 
GADGET CALLED A GROUND SOURCE HEAT 
PUMP FEW OF US HAVE EVER HEARD OF 
THESE THINGS AS FOR UNDERSTANDING 
HOW THEY WORK WELL 
THIS DERBYSHIRE COTTAGE BELONGS TO 
MATTHEW PARRIS TIMES COLUMNIST AND 
FORMER M. P. A YEAR AGO HE DECIDED TO 
INSTALL HEAT PUMP TO PROVIDE HOT 
WATER AND CENTRAL HEATING AND HE IS 
DEAD CHUFFED WITH IT THIS FIELD IS 
HEATING YOUR HOUSE AND PROVIDING 
YOUR HOT WATER THAT IS QUITE 
COMPLEX 
YOU DESERVE AN EXPLANATION COMPLEX I DO 
WE ARE TRANSFERRING ENERGY 
NOT CREATING ENERGY WE ARE TAKING 
A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT OUT OF A LOT 
OF SOIL AND CONCENTRATING IT INTO A 
LOT OF HEAT FOR YOUR HOT WATER 
SYSTEM THAT IS DONE BY HUNDREDS OF 
METRES OF PLASTIC PIPING WHICH ARE 
IN TRENCHES ABOUT A METRE BENEATH 
THE GROUND FILLED WITH WATER AND 
ANTIFREEZE BEING PUMPED AROUND THIS 
FIELD 
THE LIQUID IN THE PIPES FIELD ABSORBS THE HEAT THAT IS BURIED 
AWAY IN THE FIELD AND PUMPS IT 
TOWARDS THE HOUSE HOW DOES THIS 
TEP ID FIELD MAKE A HOT BATH HERE 
IS THE TECCHIE BIT THE GAS IS 
COMPRESSED BY THE PUMP WHICH 
CREATES ENOUGH HEAT TO HEAT THE 
WATER AND THE HOUSE IT'S LIKE A 
FRIDGE IN REVERSE 
THIS IS THE 
MACHINE IT IS CALLED A HEAT PUMP 
IT IS LIKE A FRIDGE IT LOOKS AND 
SOUNDS LIKE A FRIDGE BUT IN 
REVERSE IT COMPRESSES A GAS WHERE 
YOU WANT TO PUSH HEAT OUT AND IT 
DECOMPRESSES A GAS WHERE YOU WANT 
TO SUCK HEAT IN AND IT CIRCULATES 
THAT GAS IN A CLOSED SEALED LOOP 
THEORY LESSON OVER LET'S DO THE 
PRACTICAL 
WHEN 
YOU PUMP A BIKE UP PRACTICAL YOU WILL KNOW THE NOZZLE GETS HOT 
BECAUSE YOU ARE COMPRESSING A GAS 
O. K. 
WHEN YOU SPRAY AN AEROSOL CAN O. K. THE WHOLE THING GETS COLD THAT IS 
BECAUSE YOU ARE DECOMPRESSING A GAS 
IF YOU COULD CIRCULATE ONE GAS FROM 
THE CAN AS IT WERE TO THE PUMP YOU 
WOULD BE TAKING HEAT IN WHERE THE 
CAN WAS AND GIVING HEAT OUT WHERE 
THE PUMP WAS THAT IS ALL IT DOES 
TAKES IN HEAT EMITS HEAT IN 
ANOTHER 
ALL YOU NEED IS A FIELD ANOTHER AND ONE OF THESE TO MAKE THIS THE 
LLAMAS ARE OPTIONAL INSTALLING 
THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT COME CHEAP 
THE PUMPS AND PIPING ALONE CAN COST 
BETWEEN SIX THOUSAND TO ELEVEN THOUSAND THEN THERE 
IS THE INSTALLATION MATTHEW 
RECKONS IT WILL TAKE HIM TWELVE YEARS 
TO RECOUP HIS COST BUT THE BONUSES 
ARE HUGE GROUND SOURCE HEAT PUMPS 
ARE ECOFRIENDLY THEY CUT YOUR 
CARBON FOOTPRINT AND THEY ARE LOW 
MAINTENANCE THEY SHOULDN'T NEED 
REPLACING FOR TWENTY YEARS BUT THE 
NEWS OF ALL THEY CUT YOUR 
ENERGY BILLS IN HALF 
SO LET'S HOPE ON THE WATERFRONT 
WILL MAKE IT TO THE WEST END WILL 
IT GET A RUN 
ABSOLUTELY IT IS A 
PLAY EVERYBODY CAN ASSOCIATE WITH 
WE ARE ALL BEING SQUEEZED DRY AND 
WE FEEL THERE IS SOME CONSPIRACY 
AGAINST US FILMS OR PLAYS LIKE ON 
THE WATERFRONT HELP PEOPLE BY 
IDENTIFYING WITH A VERY STRONG 
MORAL STAND THAT TERRY MALLOY TAKES 
THAT IS WHY IT IS A GREAT PIECE TO 
SEE DON'T MISS IT 
SERIOUS STUFF 
WHAT ARE WE DOING TOMORROW ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED YEARS WE ARE CELEBRATING ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
OF MILLS AND AMP BOON 
WE ARE DOING SO 
WITH THE HELP OF GERI HALLIWELL WHO 
WILL BE TELLING US HOW SHE PLANS TO 
SPICE UP THE PUBLISHING WORLD
